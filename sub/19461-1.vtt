Alan, Alan.

02:02.834 --> 02:04.542
Hey, what's up, Dad?
Uh, you're boarding
in a few minutes.

02:04.626 --> 02:06.250
I'm gonna go
find your mother.
Dad, relax.

02:06.334 --> 02:07.959
She just doesn't want us
to see her crying.

02:08.042 --> 02:09.834
So she went to the bathroom
to cry in front of strangers.

02:10.500 --> 02:12.125
How about you, Dad?

02:12.209 --> 02:13.792
You sad to see me
finally leave home?

02:13.876 --> 02:15.709
Look, Alan,
you're going aboard
for the first time.

02:15.792 --> 02:17.000
You're gonna be
in a foreign country.

02:17.083 --> 02:20.042
You might even, you know,
go to Amsterdam.

02:20.125 --> 02:21.459
And, you know,
just... Just...

02:21.542 --> 02:22.792
European women
are different.

02:22.876 --> 02:24.334
How do you know?

02:24.417 --> 02:26.417
James Bond films, mostly,
but, that doesn't...

02:26.500 --> 02:27.918
Guys, look at mommy!

02:28.000 --> 02:30.334
Oh, that was so cute.

02:30.417 --> 02:31.751
Hi, honey.
Hi.

02:31.834 --> 02:33.626
Dad here was starting to
get worried about you.

02:33.709 --> 02:35.542
Oh, daddy should
worry about himself.

02:35.626 --> 02:37.709
He can't admit how much
he's gonna miss you.

02:37.792 --> 02:39.334
See, that's the difference
between us.

02:39.417 --> 02:41.209
I get it out
and I let it go,

02:41.292 --> 02:42.500
and he gets a headache.

02:42.584 --> 02:43.792
Well, maybe I wouldn't
get a headache

02:43.876 --> 02:45.834
if you didn't get it out
and let it go.

02:45.918 --> 02:47.792
You get a headache
because you don't
express your feelings,

02:47.876 --> 02:49.167
and that's why you
grind your teeth.

02:49.250 --> 02:50.500
Guys...
Well, maybe I...

02:50.584 --> 02:51.542
Can we not have
this moment?

02:51.626 --> 02:53.167
Oh, okay, sorry.

02:53.250 --> 02:54.667
Could you take
that, sweetie?

02:54.751 --> 02:56.417
Look, I've got
something for you.

02:56.500 --> 02:58.751
It is an international
beeper.

02:58.834 --> 03:00.209
And all you have to do
is press that little button,

03:00.292 --> 03:01.667
and anywhere you
are on the planet,

03:01.751 --> 03:03.792
it will ring on
my corresponding unit.

03:03.876 --> 03:05.959
And then what?
And then I'll call you.

03:06.042 --> 03:07.918
And if you don't answer,
she'll fly over.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.209

03:13.959 --> 03:15.250

03:15.334 --> 03:16.876
So, I guess
this is it.

03:19.459 --> 03:21.876
Give your mother a big hug.
She's very fragile today.

03:24.459 --> 03:25.667
I think daddy's
a wreck, okay,

03:25.751 --> 03:28.542
so make sure
you call him, okay?

03:30.459 --> 03:32.083
Okay...

03:32.167 --> 03:34.000
You guys take care
of each other.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.500
I was really proud
of you back there.

04:07.584 --> 04:09.000
I thought you
were gonna lose it.

04:09.083 --> 04:11.542
Yeah, so was I.
I guess I'm stronger
than I think.

04:11.626 --> 04:13.167
And, look
at it this way,

04:13.250 --> 04:14.459
we have more time
to ourselves now.

04:14.542 --> 04:17.000
Just us.
Just you and me,

04:17.083 --> 04:19.709
alone in the house.

04:24.125 --> 04:25.167
It's okay, it's okay.

04:25.834 --> 04:26.918
I'm sorry.

04:28.083 --> 04:30.000
You know,
you should be excited
about this interview.

04:30.083 --> 04:32.000
If it goes well,
we're moving to New York.

04:32.083 --> 04:34.167
We'll have more money,
and we'll have
that "New York" money.

04:34.250 --> 04:36.500
I don't want any more
money, Henry.

04:36.584 --> 04:38.918
You've been at Sellinski
for 23 years.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.542
You have a good job,

04:40.626 --> 04:43.584
and we've lived in Ohio
all our lives.

04:43.667 --> 04:45.751
Besides, I thought
you hated New York.

04:45.834 --> 04:47.584
I only hated New York
when it was hip
to hate New York.

04:47.667 --> 04:49.209
Now it's not hip
to hate it anymore,

04:49.292 --> 04:51.042
so I don't hate it.
I'm in advertising.

04:51.125 --> 04:52.959
I'm weak, and
I follow the crowd.

04:53.042 --> 04:56.542
Well, I guess we
could see Susan more.

04:56.626 --> 04:58.500
Maybe you can.
She won't speak to me.

04:58.584 --> 04:59.918
Well, yeah, I mean,
you know,

05:00.000 --> 05:02.417
when she calls up and says
she's having second thoughts
about med school

05:02.500 --> 05:04.000
and you blow up at her,
I mean, it's like...

05:04.083 --> 05:06.250
I didn't blow up at her.
Yes, you did, Henry.

05:06.334 --> 05:07.709
I did not.
I merely told her

05:07.792 --> 05:09.542
that I was
going to sue her.

05:09.626 --> 05:12.209
Oh, you can't sue your own
daughter for lost tuition.

05:12.292 --> 05:13.417
You can now.
You can.

05:13.500 --> 05:15.042
No, there's
that precedent.

05:15.125 --> 05:16.792
It's <i>Mr. Brown vs.</i>
<i>Muffy the daughter.</i>
Oh, my God!

05:55.709 --> 05:57.751
Yeah, hang on.
Hang on one second.

06:02.167 --> 06:04.375
Yeah, Tony,
yeah, thanks.

06:04.459 --> 06:05.500
Thanks for setting up
that meeting.

06:05.584 --> 06:07.751
I'm going, 10:00.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.209
Tony, I can't tell Nancy
I was fired.

06:12.417 --> 06:13.792
I know.

06:13.876 --> 06:15.542
I know, it's
very caveman of me,

06:15.626 --> 06:17.876
but that's what
I've decided...

06:17.959 --> 06:19.375
Yeah, well,
you're not Nancy.

06:20.417 --> 06:22.918
Okay, but listen,
I appreciate it.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.375
Okay, thanks, bye.

06:40.083 --> 06:41.959
There's too much food.

06:44.167 --> 06:45.167
No, there's not.

06:45.250 --> 06:47.000
I could never get enough
to eat when Alan was here.

06:47.083 --> 06:49.834
Now, pass me those
potatoes, baby.

06:49.918 --> 06:52.667
This is fantastic.
We never get
a chance to talk.

06:52.751 --> 06:54.709
When the kids were here,
we only talked about them.

06:54.792 --> 06:56.500
Now we get
to talk about us.

06:56.584 --> 06:58.834
I mean,
this is a gab-fest.

06:58.918 --> 07:00.751
Yak-yak-yak-yak-yak.

07:01.334 --> 07:02.751
So...

07:04.667 --> 07:05.876
Uh...

07:09.000 --> 07:10.375
What's going on with you?

07:12.500 --> 07:16.292
I have absolutely no idea
what I'm going to do
with the rest of my life.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.042
I can't even decide
whether I should go
to New York with you

07:20.125 --> 07:22.918
for that interview.
I'd just be tagging along

07:23.000 --> 07:26.542
out of pure panic
and insecurity.

07:26.626 --> 07:29.334
You know, but it's ironic
that the minute we have

07:29.417 --> 07:32.334
time together that we, like,
immediately separate.

07:33.709 --> 07:35.918
Although, if we force
ourselves to be together

07:36.000 --> 07:38.209
instead of letting it
happen naturally,

07:38.292 --> 07:40.918
what are we proving?

07:41.584 --> 07:43.083
Well,

07:44.834 --> 07:46.417
I don't know what
to tell you, baby.

07:54.375 --> 07:55.792
I gotta pack.

08:00.667 --> 08:01.918
Good morning, sir.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.918
How are you?
I'm fine, thank you.

Are you excited I came?

09:11.834 --> 09:13.375
I'm very excited.

09:15.792 --> 09:18.083
'Cause you don't
sound excited, Henry.

09:19.751 --> 09:21.209
I'm holding it in.

09:21.292 --> 09:23.876
He's excited.
We're all excited, okay?

09:23.959 --> 09:26.500
Oh, Henry, you forgot
your foot chums.

09:27.876 --> 09:29.500

these down, please,

over there to that man?

09:35.209 --> 09:36.918
No, that's...

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Oh, and he
always forgets this.

09:39.083 --> 09:41.042

he'll be complaining
about his rash.

09:41.125 --> 09:42.834

Oh, uh, sorry.
We're not gonna be eating.
Okay.

09:56.667 --> 09:58.500
Don't you think
we should have a little
something, Henry?

in one of the great hotels
in the world.

want to ruin that

ham and cheese sandwich.

you don't have a job.

11:26.375 --> 11:28.000
What do you mean
they didn't come out?

11:28.083 --> 11:29.375
I can't say it any simpler
than that, Henry.

11:31.083 --> 11:32.292
What do you mean
they didn't come out?

11:32.375 --> 11:34.042
Calm down, Henry.
How can I calm down?

11:34.125 --> 11:35.375
I've got to be in New York
tomorrow morning

11:35.459 --> 11:37.209

interview of my...

11:37.292 --> 11:39.500
Just give me the claim...

Excuse me! Excuse me!

11:41.709 --> 11:43.083
Are there any more
bags up there?

11:43.167 --> 11:45.292
We were supposed to land...
Are you crazy?

11:45.375 --> 11:47.459
Listen, I'm Henry Clark
from Flight 42.

11:47.542 --> 11:48.876
It's 3-6-4...

11:48.959 --> 11:50.125
You're gonna
get hurt!

11:50.209 --> 11:52.334
...6-T-dash-7... Ohh!

11:56.042 --> 11:57.626
That's not our bag!

11:58.292 --> 12:00.500
Can you describe
the bags?

12:00.584 --> 12:03.042
Yes, I have
a brown suitcase,
a brown garment bag,

12:03.125 --> 12:05.042
and three blue sportsacs.

12:05.125 --> 12:07.000
Mr. Clark, many bags
look alike.

12:07.083 --> 12:09.209
It most cases,
specific descriptions

12:09.292 --> 12:12.250
lead to apprehending
the suspect.

12:12.334 --> 12:14.834
My bags didn't
murder anyone.
They just got lost.

12:14.918 --> 12:15.876
Henry,
look at this.

12:15.959 --> 12:17.667
All right, um,

12:17.751 --> 12:20.834
my suitcase looks
something like that.

12:20.918 --> 12:25.042
Would that be the 24-
or the 26-inch model?

12:25.125 --> 12:26.500
Gee, honey, in my rush
to leave the house,

12:26.584 --> 12:28.042
I forgot to
measure my bags.

12:28.125 --> 12:30.292
Oh, it looks
a little like this.

12:30.375 --> 12:32.584
It's kinda rough,
but it'll give you an idea.

12:32.667 --> 12:36.250
Wow! Are you an artist?

12:36.334 --> 12:38.584
Well, I used to be
in advertising
with my husband.

12:38.667 --> 12:40.918
This is
a fantastic drawing.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.375
Thank you.

12:42.459 --> 12:44.751
Unfortunately,
we don't have that bag.

12:45.709 --> 12:48.584
Where will you be staying
in the Boston area?

12:48.667 --> 12:51.959
In the Boston area,
we will be staying
in New York.

12:52.042 --> 12:54.459
Oh, Henry, calm down.
There's plenty of cabs.

12:54.542 --> 12:55.709
It's not worth getting
a heart attack over.

12:55.792 --> 12:57.209
I should have eaten.

12:57.292 --> 12:59.125
You know how dizzy I get
when I don't eat.
I'm reeling.

12:59.209 --> 13:00.876
I know.
Well, there's plenty
of food on the train.

13:00.959 --> 13:02.876
You just have to go
with the flow.

13:02.959 --> 13:04.292

13:04.375 --> 13:05.751

I am going to calm down.

13:07.167 --> 13:09.167
Thank you,

13:10.375 --> 13:12.209
What's that taste?
What taste?

13:12.292 --> 13:13.459
Did you have
peanut butter?

13:13.542 --> 13:15.125
I don't know what
you're talking about.

13:15.209 --> 13:16.500
Where did you get
peanut butter?
I didn't.

13:16.584 --> 13:18.375
You usually don't taste
like peanut butter.

13:18.459 --> 13:19.876
That's it.
I'm throwing away
that lipstick.

13:19.959 --> 13:21.792
You had peanut butter.
I did not.

13:21.876 --> 13:24.042
Yes, you did.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

13:24.125 --> 13:25.334
All right,
I confess, okay?

13:25.417 --> 13:26.959
I went to
the vending machine

13:27.042 --> 13:28.375
while I was waiting
for the bags.
Aha!

13:28.459 --> 13:30.125
I had 75 cents.

13:30.209 --> 13:31.876
I put it into
the vending machine,

13:31.959 --> 13:33.959
it didn't make change,
and so I ate them all!

13:34.042 --> 13:36.042
How many were there?
Two.

13:36.125 --> 13:37.626
Two? Well, I'm dizzy.

13:37.709 --> 13:39.209
Oh, Henry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13:39.292 --> 13:40.709
It doesn't mean
I don't love you.

13:40.792 --> 13:43.083
I, uh, hate to interrupt,
but are we going anywhere?

13:43.167 --> 13:44.667
Oh, my God! I thought
we were already moving.

13:44.751 --> 13:46.417

to catch a train.

14:08.959 --> 14:10.667
Yeah.
We missed it.

14:10.751 --> 14:12.292
This can't be happening.

Oh, Henry, if you're
a little late,

14:14.375 --> 14:15.834
they won't mind.
They'll understand.

14:15.918 --> 14:17.375

give a position
of responsibility

14:17.459 --> 14:19.584

from Ohio to New York

14:19.667 --> 14:20.876

that makes any difference.

Is that a map
in front of you or what?

20:09.292 --> 20:11.459
Oh, well, gee,
I don't know, Henry.

20:11.542 --> 20:14.709
I'm not a cartographer,
but it looks like a map.

20:14.792 --> 20:16.375
It's got a lot of squiggly
little lines all over it.

20:16.459 --> 20:17.626
You want to see?

20:17.709 --> 20:19.876
Hey! That's not funny.

20:23.042 --> 20:25.959
<i>♪ Oh, you're the lover
I have waited for</i>

20:26.042 --> 20:30.000
<i>♪ You're the mate that
fate had me created for ♪</i>

20:30.083 --> 20:32.417
Okay, just stay
to the right,
right up here.

20:32.500 --> 20:35.751
Are you sure, Henry?
Why don't we use that
navigation system?

20:35.834 --> 20:37.834
Honey, I'm in charge
of the map now.

20:37.918 --> 20:40.334
You just go straight
across the Triborough Bridge,
onto the FDR,

20:40.417 --> 20:42.834
and we're right into
the heart of Manhattan.

20:42.918 --> 20:44.042
All right.

20:45.667 --> 20:47.209
Is that New York City
back there?

20:47.292 --> 20:49.417
What are you
talking about?

20:49.500 --> 20:51.918
Oh, no, this is the
George Washington Bridge.

20:52.042 --> 20:53.959
This map...
What do you mean,
the map?

20:54.042 --> 20:56.918
You think everything I do
is from reading the map?

21:01.167 --> 21:03.417
COMPUTER VOICE:
<i>Proceed down Grand Street.</i>

21:03.500 --> 21:05.083
"Proceed down
Grand Street."

21:05.167 --> 21:06.792
Oh, don't feel bad.

21:06.876 --> 21:09.417
He's obviously
been here before.
He knows the city.

21:09.500 --> 21:11.000
Well, I wouldn't have
been confused at all

21:11.083 --> 21:12.626
if we'd come into the city
the right way.

21:12.709 --> 21:14.626
Well, he is not confused.

(SPEAKING FRENCH)

21:18.209 --> 21:20.375
Huh? It's French.
What's that?

21:20.459 --> 21:21.709
Here, just press
this over here.

21:21.792 --> 21:23.417
No, no, no, no,
don't press it.

21:23.500 --> 21:25.459

I don't know droit.

What did he say?

21:30.000 --> 21:32.250
It's Chinese or something.
Find Spanish.
Just find Spanish.

21:32.334 --> 21:34.542
No, what's he saying?
Find Spanish.

21:34.626 --> 21:37.250
I can't find Spanish.
I don't know how
to work this thing.

21:39.542 --> 21:41.125

I'll press that.

Henry, do something!

21:42.667 --> 21:43.918
Nancy, Nancy!
Aah!

21:44.542 --> 21:46.167
Turn! Turn! Turn!

21:48.667 --> 21:50.083
Nancy, it's fish!

21:52.209 --> 21:53.959
Oh, my God! God!

(COMPUTER SPEAKING FRENCH)

22:09.375 --> 22:10.626
How's your nose, honey?

22:10.709 --> 22:12.876
It's tender to the touch,
just like me.

22:13.918 --> 22:18.292
What's the bill?
Oh, it's $2,200.

22:18.375 --> 22:19.500
I could have bought
a car for that.

22:19.584 --> 22:20.709
Oh, I know.

22:21.709 --> 22:24.250
Oh, look at New York.

22:24.334 --> 22:25.834
Where?

22:25.918 --> 22:27.626
Honey, I want
to get to the hotel.

22:27.709 --> 22:28.709
How do we get there?
That's very simple.

22:28.792 --> 22:30.375
The streets of New York

22:30.459 --> 22:31.792
are laid out
on a rigid grid.

22:31.876 --> 22:33.667
Yeah, like somebody
else I know.

22:33.751 --> 22:35.000
You want to get
there or not?

22:35.083 --> 22:38.626
Yes, I do. All right,
so we follow the rigid grid

22:38.709 --> 22:40.876
to Park Avenue
and 64th Street.

22:40.959 --> 22:42.834
But now, all right,
now wait, right now
we're at...

22:42.918 --> 22:44.626
No, don't look
around at the signs.

22:44.709 --> 22:45.959
That's how people know
you're from out of town.

22:46.042 --> 22:47.667
You don't want that.

22:47.751 --> 22:49.209
By the way, there's
a walk New Yorkers have.

22:49.292 --> 22:50.709
They never stroll.

22:50.792 --> 22:52.375
They always look like
they have someplace,

22:52.459 --> 22:53.709
you know, really
important to go to.

22:53.792 --> 22:55.292
Okay.
It's gotta be like, uh...

22:55.375 --> 22:56.751
It's, uh...

22:59.292 --> 23:01.709
(LAUGHING) Henry.

23:01.792 --> 23:03.542
You know, go ahead
and make fun, you know,

23:03.626 --> 23:06.125
but you walk like a tourist,
and that's how you get
in trouble.

23:11.792 --> 23:13.918
Excuse me. I'm terribly
sorry to disturb you.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.167
I can't tell you how
embarrassing this is.

23:16.250 --> 23:19.209
I just left all my money
and credit cards in a cab.

23:19.292 --> 23:21.709
I'm late to a rehearsal.
I've got a play on Broadway
at the moment.

23:21.792 --> 23:23.417
If I could borrow
$5.00 for a taxi,

23:23.500 --> 23:24.918
you can come with me
to the theater.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.083
I will pay you back there.
You expect us
to believe this?

23:29.083 --> 23:31.709
No. No, I suppose not.
I'm sorry to have
bothered you.

23:31.792 --> 23:33.834
What play?
Nancy, there's no play.

23:33.918 --> 23:35.083
Actually, it's a revival

23:35.167 --> 23:37.834
of <i>Jesus Christ Superstar</i>
at the Broadhurst Theater.

23:37.918 --> 23:39.250
Do come if you
get the chance.

23:39.334 --> 23:41.459
Wait a minute.
<i>Jesus Christ Superstar?</i>

23:41.542 --> 23:43.125
Oh, my God. Are you
Andrew Lloyd Webber?

23:44.209 --> 23:45.709
Yes... Thank you. I...

23:45.792 --> 23:47.709
Oh, honey, it's
Andrew Lloyd Webber!

23:47.792 --> 23:49.792
We go into previews
next week, and as I said...

23:49.876 --> 23:51.584
We love
<i>Jesus Christ Superstar.</i>

23:51.667 --> 23:53.876
We saw
<i>Phantom of the Opera.</i>
And <i>Evita.</i>

23:53.959 --> 23:56.167
And <i>Evita.</i>
That was so great.

23:56.250 --> 23:58.250
And <i>Cats...</i>
Ohhh...

23:58.334 --> 24:00.500
Oh, honey, that was just...

24:00.584 --> 24:02.500
It hit so home for us.

24:02.584 --> 24:04.334
We lost a cat that year.

24:04.417 --> 24:06.209
It didn't sing
like your cats.

24:06.292 --> 24:07.876
I'm Henry Clark, and
this is my wife Nancy.

24:07.959 --> 24:09.542
A pleasure
to meet you both.

24:09.626 --> 24:12.000
We'd be honored
to lend you anything.

24:12.083 --> 24:14.250
No. Please. You mustn't
take out an open wallet
in the city,

24:14.334 --> 24:16.125
no matter how much
the crime rate's dropped.

24:16.209 --> 24:18.417
Yeah, well, I...
I entered Yokelville.

24:18.500 --> 24:19.876
Come on... Come over here.
Come on.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.042
I am so embarrassed
about this.

24:22.125 --> 24:23.959
No, don't be embarrassed.
When we tell the people
in Ohio

24:24.042 --> 24:25.459
that we lent
Andrew Lloyd Webber five...

24:25.542 --> 24:26.792
Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber...

24:26.876 --> 24:28.500
Sir. Sir...
No, it's Lord.

24:28.584 --> 24:30.292
I think he's a Lord.
Sir Lord.

24:30.375 --> 24:31.709
Sir Lord. You know
Paul McCartney?

24:31.792 --> 24:33.000
All right, shut up.

24:33.083 --> 24:34.417
What's he like?
Is he, like, fun...

24:34.500 --> 24:36.792
Shut up. Shut up!
What? Jesus!

24:36.876 --> 24:39.083
Give me...
Give it to me!

24:39.167 --> 24:40.417
Give me the bag.

24:40.500 --> 24:41.751
Give me the bag.
Give me...

24:41.834 --> 24:44.792
Give him the bag!
Hey... Oh, my God!

24:44.876 --> 24:47.626
Ohh! Why are you
doing this?

24:47.709 --> 24:49.709
Every show you do
is a hit!

24:50.292 --> 24:51.876
HENRY: Hey!
Henry!

24:51.959 --> 24:54.292
Henry, Andrew Lloyd Webber
just stole my pocketbook!

24:54.375 --> 24:56.876
He's not Andrew Lloyd Webber.
He's just a common criminal.

24:56.959 --> 24:58.751
Oh, Henry. I have
jelly legs, honey!

24:58.834 --> 25:00.042
Come on. Let's
get outta here.

25:00.125 --> 25:01.751
What are we
gonna do, Henry?

25:01.834 --> 25:04.083
Here. Here.
Okay. Okay, watch.

25:04.876 --> 25:06.000
What are you
doing, Henry?

25:06.083 --> 25:07.417
Credit card.
I put it in my sock

25:07.500 --> 25:08.667
when we were
on the plane.

25:08.751 --> 25:10.167
Oh! You're a genius!

25:10.250 --> 25:12.375
Thank you, thank you.
My God! You're a genius!

25:12.459 --> 25:14.834
Put it away! We might run
into Stephen Sondheim.

25:23.417 --> 25:24.626
Hello.
Hello.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.167
Ohhh...

25:34.292 --> 25:36.792
Oh, thank God. Look!

25:36.876 --> 25:38.209
Look at this place.

25:38.292 --> 25:40.500
Oh, it's beautiful.

25:40.584 --> 25:42.751
Oh, it's good
to be inside.

25:42.834 --> 25:44.500
Michelle, is that
a new haircut?

25:44.584 --> 25:46.042
Yes, it is.

25:46.125 --> 25:47.584
I think you'd better
stay in the back
for a while.

25:47.667 --> 25:49.209
(DING)

25:49.292 --> 25:51.709
Good evening. Welcome
to the Grand Mark Hotel.

25:51.792 --> 25:53.000
How may I be
of service to you?

25:53.083 --> 25:54.500
We have a reservation.
Clark.

25:56.125 --> 25:57.834
My name is Mersault,
the manager of the hotel.

25:57.918 --> 25:59.584
Yes, here we are.
Mr. and Mrs. Clark.

25:59.667 --> 26:01.209
If there's anything
at all I can do

26:01.292 --> 26:02.918
to make your stay
more pleasant,

26:03.000 --> 26:04.334
please don't hesitate
to let me know.

26:04.417 --> 26:05.876
That would be
room service.

26:05.959 --> 26:07.209
We haven't eaten
since this morning.

26:07.292 --> 26:08.667
Oh, we're starving.

26:08.751 --> 26:10.542
Send a complimentary basket
of fruit and cheese up,

26:10.626 --> 26:12.250
along with a fine merlot?

26:12.334 --> 26:15.334
Oh, yummy.

26:15.417 --> 26:17.000
If I could just
have an imprint
of your credit card?

26:17.083 --> 26:20.292
And then we'll have you
up to your...

26:20.375 --> 26:22.959
To... Uh, to your room...
In a jiffy.

26:23.042 --> 26:24.751
You wouldn't believe
what we've been through.

26:24.834 --> 26:26.042
First our flight
was rerouted.

26:26.125 --> 26:27.876
Then they sent us
to Boston.

26:27.959 --> 26:29.083
And then when
we finally got here,

26:29.167 --> 26:30.834
we were mugged
by Andrew Lloyd Webber.

26:30.918 --> 26:32.834
How extraordinary.

26:32.918 --> 26:34.626
Well, I'll certainly
mention it next time
he stays with us.

26:34.709 --> 26:36.125
Perhaps he's under some
strain at the moment.

26:36.209 --> 26:37.584
Ah. We have
a message for you.

26:40.918 --> 26:42.375
"We have
located your luggage."

26:42.459 --> 26:44.584
"Thanks again to Mrs. Clark
for the lovely sketch."

26:44.667 --> 26:46.876
"We will deliver
to the hotel
later this evening."

26:46.959 --> 26:48.500
Oh, they're so sweet, honey.

26:48.584 --> 26:49.834
Oh, God.

26:49.918 --> 26:52.000
At last, some good news.

26:52.083 --> 26:53.709
Um, I'm afraid
we seem to have

26:53.792 --> 26:55.667
a little problem
with your credit card.

26:55.751 --> 26:57.459
What kind of problem?

26:57.542 --> 27:00.709
A financial one.
Would you care
to speak to them?

27:00.792 --> 27:03.000
Yes? This is...

27:04.918 --> 27:06.334
This is Henry Clark.

27:06.417 --> 27:08.000
I've never had a problem
with my credit card.

27:08.083 --> 27:09.792
Have I ever had a problem
with my credit card?

27:09.876 --> 27:12.792
I don't know who you had
a problem with, Henry.

27:12.876 --> 27:16.083
No, I never purchased
anything at Uncle's Stereo
in Manhattan.

27:17.542 --> 27:19.542
$800 at Sofas You Love?

27:20.375 --> 27:22.792
Susan Clark.
Yes, she's my daughter.

27:22.876 --> 27:24.626
She's how much overdue?

27:28.083 --> 27:30.042
I understand. Thank you.

27:31.334 --> 27:34.417
Nancy. Nancy.
You won't believe this.

27:34.500 --> 27:36.709
Susan has stolen
one of our credit cards.

27:36.792 --> 27:38.083
What are you doing, Henry?

27:38.167 --> 27:41.250
I'm going to call her
so I can scream at someone.

27:41.334 --> 27:43.417
The battery's dead.

27:43.500 --> 27:44.792
May I borrow your phone?

27:44.876 --> 27:48.167
Uh, there's a pay phone
on Lexington and 64th.

27:48.250 --> 27:50.959
Henry. Henry, I'm gonna
tell you something,

27:51.042 --> 27:52.876
but I want you to
promise not to lose it.

27:52.959 --> 27:54.375
See, she couldn't stay
in the med school dorms

27:54.459 --> 27:56.167
because that was just
for enrolled students,

27:56.250 --> 27:57.459
she was looking
for an apartment

27:57.542 --> 27:59.417
once she decided that
she was gonna drop out

27:59.500 --> 28:01.334
and become an actress,
that's why I gave her
the credit card.

28:01.417 --> 28:03.375
Don't be mad at her, Henry.
Be mad at me.

28:03.459 --> 28:05.125
How about if I'm mad
at both of you?

28:05.209 --> 28:06.584
I was just trying
to protect you.

28:06.667 --> 28:08.125
Don't try and protect me.

28:08.209 --> 28:09.375
Susan has dropped out
of med school,

28:09.459 --> 28:10.626
and you didn't tell me?

28:10.709 --> 28:12.918
No, because
when I tell you...

28:13.542 --> 28:15.000
Sorry to interrupt,

28:15.083 --> 28:17.292
but as the credit card company
won't honor the charges,

28:17.375 --> 28:19.334
I'm afraid I'm unable
to offer you a room,

28:19.417 --> 28:21.417
but do please come back
when you have some money.

28:21.500 --> 28:23.792
Oh... Please?

28:23.876 --> 28:25.375
Can't you
just trust us?

28:25.459 --> 28:27.167
(CHOKING ON HIS LAUGHTER)

28:27.250 --> 28:28.792
(ALL LAUGH)

28:28.876 --> 28:30.209
Are you throwing us out?

28:30.292 --> 28:32.667
Good heavens, no. No, no.
Security will do that.

28:33.918 --> 28:35.667
Oh, I don't believe this.

28:37.500 --> 28:39.000
What do we do now?

28:39.083 --> 28:41.292
We're going to Susan's.
No. Thank you.

28:41.375 --> 28:44.209
Henry, it's her life.
It took a lot of courage
to drop out.

28:44.292 --> 28:46.334
It's easy to be courageous
with daddy's credit card.

28:46.417 --> 28:48.375
Well, it's her passion.
Don't you understand
passion?

28:48.459 --> 28:50.417
Hey, I'm filled
with passion.

28:50.500 --> 28:52.042
When I was her age,
I wanted to be a writer,

28:52.125 --> 28:53.834
my father practically
went berserk.

28:53.918 --> 28:55.500
Well, isn't this
the same situation?

28:55.584 --> 28:58.167
No, because I went to him,
and I discussed it with him.

28:58.250 --> 28:59.500
Well, then we're
going to Susan's,

28:59.584 --> 29:01.500
and we're gonna
discuss it with her.

29:01.584 --> 29:03.792
Call me crazy,
but somehow
I'm not in the mood

29:03.876 --> 29:05.667
to see her new furniture
right now.

29:05.751 --> 29:08.083
Eventually you're gonna
have to work this out
with her, Henry.

29:08.167 --> 29:09.500
I'm supposed to work it
out with her?

29:09.584 --> 29:12.167
After she throws away
$50,000 in tuition money

29:12.250 --> 29:13.667
without even
consulting me?

29:13.751 --> 29:15.584
Maybe that's the way
they do it in bizarro world,

29:15.667 --> 29:17.292
but not in Ohio.

29:17.375 --> 29:19.459
This is not Ohio, Henry.
It's New York.

29:19.542 --> 29:21.375
And we're hungry
and homeless,

29:21.459 --> 29:23.167
which is exactly what
my parents said I'd be

29:23.250 --> 29:25.167
if I married you.
I'm going!

29:33.626 --> 29:35.459
What am I supposed to do?

29:42.000 --> 29:43.459
All right. I'll follow you
till you get there,

29:43.542 --> 29:45.209
but then I'm leaving!

29:47.500 --> 29:49.959
I don't know
why you're being
so judgmental, Henry.

29:50.042 --> 29:52.167
I mean, she might be
a wonderful actress.

29:52.250 --> 29:55.250
And you'd actually
be very proud of her now
because she's writing.

29:55.334 --> 29:56.792
I'm glad
you told me that.

29:56.876 --> 29:58.334
I was worried there
for a minute,

29:58.417 --> 30:00.667
but if she's going
to act and write...

30:02.584 --> 30:03.959
Let's see. One...

30:04.042 --> 30:05.751
Oh, here it is. 148.

30:08.250 --> 30:09.918
Here it is.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.292
Who's Guerrero?
I don't know.

30:12.375 --> 30:14.167
You don't know,
or you're not telling me?

30:14.250 --> 30:15.876
Because we've established
there's a difference.

30:15.959 --> 30:18.000

30:18.083 --> 30:19.751

in her new sofa.

come on. Let's go.

30:26.834 --> 30:29.250

stay outside here

31:33.792 --> 31:36.375

I don't have a key.

31:47.626 --> 31:49.167
Ask how she got in here.
How'd you get in?

31:49.250 --> 31:50.667
Ask her to stop
asking me questions.

31:50.751 --> 31:52.500
I don't have to answer.
I'm getting out.

First of all, I'd like
to welcome our new members.

If you could
introduce yourselves...

33:55.250 --> 33:57.918
Uh, my name is Nancy,

33:58.000 --> 33:59.876
and this is
my husband Henry.

33:59.959 --> 34:01.626
ALL: Hi, Nancy and Henry.

34:01.709 --> 34:03.751
Welcome.
Hello.

34:03.834 --> 34:07.209
Welcome. Last week, we were
discussing Edward's problem.

34:07.292 --> 34:08.667
Edward?

34:08.751 --> 34:09.709
It's okay.

34:11.542 --> 34:14.292
I'd like to start off
by letting everyone know

34:14.375 --> 34:17.000
how much your support
has meant to me.

34:17.083 --> 34:19.292
As you know,
I've been masturbating

34:19.375 --> 34:20.667
up to 17 times a day.

34:21.125 --> 34:22.709
Nancy, we have to go.

34:22.792 --> 34:24.584
Henry, Nancy,

34:24.667 --> 34:27.334
you're giving Edward
a very negative message.

34:27.417 --> 34:29.125
Yeah?
Sit down, please.

34:32.375 --> 34:34.042
We don't want to send
a negative message.

34:34.125 --> 34:35.626
Not too close.

34:36.626 --> 34:39.209
So, Edward, how was
last week for you?

34:39.292 --> 34:42.500
It's been really wonderful,
thank you. Uh...

34:42.584 --> 34:44.500
I've been concentrating
on translating

34:44.584 --> 34:48.209
the sexual impulse into
other forms of expression.

34:48.292 --> 34:51.083
Uh, working out regularly,
going to movies,

34:51.167 --> 34:52.584
calling friends.

34:52.667 --> 34:54.417
Trying to integrate
the urge

34:54.500 --> 34:56.417
into a more well-rounded
lifestyle.

34:56.500 --> 34:57.542

Were you able to cut down

35:09.292 --> 35:12.459
on your number of
random sexual encounters
during the week?

35:12.542 --> 35:14.584
Well, I've had the flu,
so just my doctor.

35:14.667 --> 35:17.876
Ah. Single digits.
That's great. Okay,

35:17.959 --> 35:19.626
let's hear
from the new people.
What about you folks?

35:21.125 --> 35:22.584
Actually, we just got
in here by mistake.

35:22.667 --> 35:24.542
We really came in
to worship,

35:24.626 --> 35:25.834
and this is
the wrong denomination.

35:26.626 --> 35:28.542
My husband is right.
I mean,

35:28.626 --> 35:30.292
actually, we don't really
even have sex that much.

35:30.375 --> 35:32.250
Nancy!
Hmm?

35:32.334 --> 35:33.959
Oh, so your problem
is lack of sex.

35:34.042 --> 35:35.542
Tell us more.

35:35.626 --> 35:37.709
You know something?
We're from Ohio,

35:37.792 --> 35:40.083
and we really don't
discuss sex in public.

35:40.167 --> 35:41.042
It's sort of our
state motto.

35:42.709 --> 35:44.667
Well, actually, um...
That's part of the problem,

35:44.751 --> 35:45.918
is that
we don't discuss it.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.834
Nancy, we're from Ohio.

35:47.918 --> 35:50.125
But we don't even really
do it very much anymore.

35:50.209 --> 35:52.083
And when you do,
it's probably programmed

35:52.167 --> 35:54.125
and lacking in spontaneity.

35:54.209 --> 35:55.626
Exactly. It's like, um...

35:55.709 --> 35:56.876
It's like we're
two dead people.

35:56.959 --> 35:58.125
Nancy! Ohio!

35:58.918 --> 36:00.459
So it's not so much

36:00.542 --> 36:02.125
the declining frequency

36:02.209 --> 36:03.918
as the fact that you've
both come to accept

36:04.000 --> 36:06.584
this lack of physical
and emotional intimacy.

36:06.667 --> 36:08.626
This is boring.
If this keeps up,

36:08.709 --> 36:11.000
I'm gonna sleep
with somebody right now.

36:11.083 --> 36:13.459
Have you tried tying
each other up with bamboo?

36:13.542 --> 36:15.626
No. Actually,
we use the club.

36:15.709 --> 36:18.000
Oh. The time. Well, okay.

36:18.083 --> 36:19.709
Henry, discussing it

36:19.792 --> 36:21.584
is the first step toward
solving the problem.

36:21.667 --> 36:23.959
You know what?
I don't have a problem.

36:24.042 --> 36:27.334
I mean, I enjoy sex as much
as the next guy. Euhh.

36:27.417 --> 36:28.667
Henry, let's face it.

36:28.751 --> 36:30.250

in over two months.

you have a problem.

36:37.626 --> 36:40.000
Well, okay. I've been
a little tense lately.

36:40.083 --> 36:41.417
What have you
been tense about?

36:42.417 --> 36:43.667
What have I been
tense about?

36:43.751 --> 36:45.459
Yeah.
Let's just say
I've been tense.

36:45.542 --> 36:46.876
Well, why
have you been tense?

36:46.959 --> 36:48.709
Why have I been tense?
Why have I been tense?

36:48.792 --> 36:49.834
I don't know.

36:49.918 --> 36:51.709
Like, I don't have
the right to be tense?

36:51.792 --> 36:54.375
Henry, would you like
to share with the group

36:54.459 --> 36:55.876
the reason
why you feel tense?

36:55.959 --> 36:58.834
Yes. I'd love to share
this with the group.

37:03.250 --> 37:04.709
I was fired.

37:05.459 --> 37:07.375

37:07.459 --> 37:08.542

I got fired.

37:08.626 --> 37:09.918

I could get

and...

How could you
not tell me?

37:14.751 --> 37:16.792
I was gonna here alone.
I was gonna get this job.

37:16.876 --> 37:18.751
You came with me.
I had to lie to you
to keep it from you,

37:18.834 --> 37:20.667
and it just creates
more tension!

37:20.751 --> 37:22.667
I would love to
sleep with you, Henry.

37:22.751 --> 37:26.918
I find failure very erotic.
Or success. Doesn't matter.

Uh, I'm... I'm sorry that,
uh, that we ruined your
meeting,

37:35.000 --> 37:37.709
and I hope that you can all,
uh, stop having sex.

37:39.083 --> 37:40.500
You were fired?

37:40.584 --> 37:42.500
I don't believe it!

37:42.584 --> 37:43.876
Not only do I hear it
for the first time,

37:43.959 --> 37:46.751
but I hear it in front
of a bunch of perverts?

37:46.834 --> 37:49.334
Oh, God! How could you
not tell me?

37:49.417 --> 37:50.584
Hey, you lied to me
about Susan.

37:50.667 --> 37:52.334
It wasn't really a lie.

37:52.417 --> 37:55.375
It was an incremental
accumulation of half truths.

37:55.459 --> 37:57.000
Oh, really. Well, then
mine wasn't a lie, either.

37:57.083 --> 37:58.459
It was spin.

37:58.542 --> 38:00.209
Did it ever occur to you
that I could've helped you?

38:00.292 --> 38:02.083
We were partners.
We worked together.

38:02.167 --> 38:04.083
I know a little bit
about advertising.

38:06.000 --> 38:09.250
I... I couldn't tell you.
I was ashamed.

38:09.334 --> 38:12.375
The only thing you have
to be ashamed of, Henry,
is not telling me.

38:12.459 --> 38:14.250
If we can't be
honest with each other,

38:14.334 --> 38:16.125
what kind of marriage
do we have?

38:16.209 --> 38:18.209
I guess it's the kind where
I don't tell you I was fired

38:18.292 --> 38:20.959
and you don't tell me
our daughter's been
embezzling from us.

38:21.042 --> 38:21.959
It's very common.

38:23.542 --> 38:24.876
So what did
Sellinski do,

38:24.959 --> 38:26.918
just let you go
after 23 years?

38:28.876 --> 38:30.959
They're letting
all the older guys
run out their contracts.

38:31.042 --> 38:32.459
Apparently,
if you're over 40,

38:32.542 --> 38:34.167
you're not
cutting-edge anymore.

38:34.250 --> 38:36.125
Well, that's ridiculous.
You were never cutting-edge.

38:36.209 --> 38:37.834
That's what
I told them.

38:37.918 --> 38:39.751
All right, we're gonna
forget about Sellinski.

38:39.834 --> 38:41.375
We're gonna
forget about them,

38:41.459 --> 38:43.125
and this is
a whole new
start for you.

38:43.209 --> 38:44.709
I'm not getting this job.

38:44.792 --> 38:46.751
Not without a shave
and a clean suit

38:46.834 --> 38:48.417
and a good night's sleep.
By tomorrow morning,

38:48.500 --> 38:49.834
I'm gonna look
like Keith Richards.

38:49.918 --> 38:52.125
Henry, now's not
the time to give up.

38:52.209 --> 38:53.918
I'm not giving up.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.751
Giving up is when you
can still get the job

38:55.834 --> 38:57.584
and you give up.
I don't have that option.

38:57.667 --> 38:59.751
I wish I could give up.

38:59.834 --> 39:01.459
Henry, Henry,
you know what this is?

39:01.542 --> 39:02.918
What is it?

39:03.000 --> 39:06.417
It's a test. Here we are
in the middle of our lives,

39:06.500 --> 39:08.000
and we have
a decision to make.

39:08.083 --> 39:10.751
Are we on a...
A slow march toward death,

39:10.834 --> 39:12.542
or are we gonna
embrace life?

39:12.626 --> 39:13.918
Slow march toward death?

39:14.584 --> 39:17.334
No! Embrace life!

39:17.417 --> 39:20.959
I want to live!
I want to feel useful!

39:21.042 --> 39:23.834
I want to explore
and experience!

39:23.918 --> 39:26.584
I... I want to suck
the marrow
out of life, Henry!

39:26.667 --> 39:29.125
What do you want?

39:29.209 --> 39:31.709
Well, I... I definitely want
to do some marrow-sucking.

39:31.792 --> 39:33.834
Uh, but otherwise,
I think I...

39:33.918 --> 39:37.083
I just want to catch up
on my reading...

39:37.167 --> 39:39.876
And, you know, fix
those kitchen cabinets
that are broken.

39:39.959 --> 39:42.709
That's it?
That all you want to do

39:42.792 --> 39:44.292
is just sit home
fixing things and reading

39:44.375 --> 39:45.834
for the rest
of your life?

39:47.375 --> 39:50.209
'Cause I don't know how
I fit into that plan, Henry.

39:50.292 --> 39:51.834
All you need
is a good light
and a hammer.

39:53.459 --> 39:55.000
Maybe we have
different plans.

39:56.876 --> 39:58.709
Oh, come on, Henry.

39:58.792 --> 40:00.000
Come on, think.

40:00.083 --> 40:02.709
Think, honey.
There must be something.

40:04.751 --> 40:06.918
Well... Um...

40:07.000 --> 40:08.876
I'd like to get some food.
I'm hungry.

40:08.959 --> 40:11.459
And, you know, uh...
We don't have any bags.

40:11.542 --> 40:12.667
We don't have any money,
so that's a...

40:12.751 --> 40:14.834
Bags! Oh! Henry!

40:14.918 --> 40:17.626
The bags! Remember?
When we went to Freeport?

40:17.709 --> 40:19.250
We can't eat the bags.
I know we can't
eat the bags.

40:19.334 --> 40:21.167
Remember when we went
to Freeport and you told me

40:21.250 --> 40:23.250
to put the travelers' checks
inside the bag?

40:23.334 --> 40:26.125
They're in the bag!
Let's go back to the hotel
and find them.

40:26.209 --> 40:27.792
You left them in the bag?
I left them in the bag.

40:27.876 --> 40:29.083
You left... How much?

40:29.167 --> 40:31.000
$600.
$600?

40:31.083 --> 40:33.584
It's not earning interest
when it's in the bag.

40:33.667 --> 40:35.459
Oh, stop it.

40:37.709 --> 40:39.167
Here he is.

40:41.626 --> 40:42.876
We're back.

40:42.959 --> 40:45.792
Mr. and Mrs. Clark,
the sequel.

40:45.876 --> 40:47.083
Did our luggage
get here yet?

40:47.167 --> 40:48.918
I'm afraid not,
but I'll let you know

40:49.000 --> 40:50.709
the moment it arrives,
if you care to write
the name

40:50.792 --> 40:52.000
of your hostel there.

40:52.083 --> 40:53.334
Very funny.

40:53.417 --> 40:55.375
But how very nice
to see you!

40:55.459 --> 40:57.751
Oh, thank you.
You know,
it's so nice to...

40:57.834 --> 40:59.459
How was Monte Carlo?

40:59.542 --> 41:01.083
Oh, it would not
stop raining.

41:01.167 --> 41:02.375
Damn the French!

41:02.459 --> 41:04.209
The doorman at the curb

41:04.292 --> 41:06.626
did not help Mrs. Wellstone
out of the car.
Damn the doorman.

41:06.709 --> 41:08.375
He was helping some large,
unfortunate woman

41:08.459 --> 41:09.792
with a crated animal.

41:09.876 --> 41:11.042
They should've
both been crated.

41:11.125 --> 41:14.000
Good point.
I'll have all three of
them removed immediately.

41:14.083 --> 41:17.417
Now, that is the kind
of service I expect.

41:17.500 --> 41:19.792
And that's the kind of
service you shall receive,
Mr. Wellstone,

41:19.876 --> 41:21.500
as long as
I'm aboveground.

41:21.584 --> 41:23.751
MRS. WELLSTONE:
Maybe you two should
get a room together.

41:23.834 --> 41:25.083
MERSAULT:
I'm here to serve.

41:25.167 --> 41:26.918
You and me both.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.584
Now, is there
anything at all
that I can get you?

41:29.667 --> 41:32.626
MR. WELLSTONE: Just make
sure that it doesn't rain
while we're here.

41:32.709 --> 41:34.167
I'll speak
to housekeeping.

41:34.250 --> 41:37.751
And, Mrs. Wellstone,
I just love those shoes.

41:39.500 --> 41:40.751
Don't break my heart

41:40.834 --> 41:42.250
and tell me
they're not real leopard.

41:42.334 --> 41:44.083
Mmm-hmm.
(LAUGHS)

41:44.834 --> 41:46.375
Come on, come on.

41:46.459 --> 41:48.125
MR. WELLSTONE:
Off we go.

41:54.584 --> 41:56.292
Henry, look!

41:57.584 --> 41:59.000
I don't want
to get you
too excited,

41:59.083 --> 42:00.584
but I think
they have trail mix.

42:00.667 --> 42:02.209
Buffet time, honey.

42:02.292 --> 42:04.334
I'm gonna find a bathroom.
Order me a peanut.

42:10.626 --> 42:12.000
Thank you.

42:13.042 --> 42:14.083
Ohhh...

42:16.209 --> 42:17.667
(CRUNCHING LOUDLY)

42:17.751 --> 42:19.292
(CRUNCHING) Mmm.

42:20.334 --> 42:21.500
(CHUCKLING)

42:22.751 --> 42:23.918
Special diet?

42:24.709 --> 42:26.125
Mmm-hmm.

42:28.626 --> 42:30.209
Could I get you
something to
drink with that?

42:30.292 --> 42:31.751
Oh, no, thank you.
I wouldn't want to impose.

42:31.834 --> 42:33.083
Oh, no imposition.

42:33.167 --> 42:34.375
Are you sure
I couldn't get you...

42:34.459 --> 42:35.834
Champagne.

42:36.667 --> 42:38.083
Champagne for the lady.

42:38.167 --> 42:39.500
Thank you.

42:39.584 --> 42:41.083
(CRUNCHING LOUDLY)

42:42.125 --> 42:43.042
Can I have some
of those cherries, please?

42:43.125 --> 42:44.709
Sure.

42:44.792 --> 42:46.792
No, the whole thing.
The whole thing.

42:46.876 --> 42:49.167
Thank you. Mmm-hmm.

42:49.250 --> 42:51.667
Mmm. Oh, thank you.

42:51.751 --> 42:54.417
Hi. I'm... I'm Greg.
I'm here from LA.

42:54.500 --> 42:55.918
I'm an agent.

42:56.000 --> 42:57.542
I'm on my way
down to the village

42:57.626 --> 42:59.250
to check out this
new Irish playwright

42:59.334 --> 43:00.417
for a sitcom
that I packaged.

43:00.500 --> 43:02.500
Mmm-hmm. Mmm.

43:02.584 --> 43:04.334
Actually, I've got
an extra ticket,

43:04.417 --> 43:07.292
and I do have a limo...
If you'd be interested.

43:10.167 --> 43:12.000
Are you staying
in the hotel, Greg?

43:12.667 --> 43:13.918
Yes. Suite. 14th floor.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.167
Mmm. Are you alone?

43:18.584 --> 43:19.918
Just me and
my expense account.

43:20.000 --> 43:21.584
(CHUCKLES LOUDLY)

43:21.667 --> 43:22.834
You're funny, Greg.

43:22.918 --> 43:24.918
Hey, baby,
how's it goin'?

43:25.000 --> 43:28.167
Oh, shut up.
What are you, 106?

43:28.751 --> 43:30.042
Let's move to a table.

43:30.751 --> 43:32.125
It won't be so noisy.

43:32.209 --> 43:33.542
Okay. Yeah, sure.

43:45.000 --> 43:46.167
Well.

43:46.250 --> 43:48.834
So, do you
come here often?

43:48.918 --> 43:51.000
Only when my husband
works late.

43:51.083 --> 43:53.584
You're married.
I'm sorry.
I never would've...

43:53.667 --> 43:56.167
No. Uh, actually,
I think my husband's
having an affair.

43:56.250 --> 43:57.334
Oh.
Yeah.

43:57.417 --> 43:59.125
Really.

43:59.209 --> 44:00.792
In fact, I wish he'd
stay out more often.

44:00.876 --> 44:02.167
You know. Yeah.

44:02.250 --> 44:03.626
(CHUCKLES)

44:03.709 --> 44:05.083
Look, I don't
want to seem

44:05.167 --> 44:07.042
like one of those
successful guys

44:07.125 --> 44:08.626
that blows in
from the west coast

44:08.709 --> 44:10.209
for a few meetings
and a good time,

44:10.292 --> 44:12.125
but if you wanted to
get together anytime...

44:12.209 --> 44:14.042
Give me the key
to your room, Greg.

44:15.667 --> 44:17.042
What?

44:17.125 --> 44:19.250
Oh, come on.
Let's not play
games, Greg.

44:19.334 --> 44:20.918
You know what
we're talking about.

44:21.000 --> 44:23.417
Ha-ha! I was wondering

44:23.500 --> 44:25.042
if I might speak
with you for a moment?

44:25.125 --> 44:27.375
No! Creep.

44:27.459 --> 44:30.792
I am trying to have
a conversation with
this gentleman. Okay?

44:30.876 --> 44:32.125
Please stop
harassing me,

44:32.209 --> 44:33.334
or I'm gonna call
the manager.

44:33.417 --> 44:35.959
Now, go away. Just go!

44:37.209 --> 44:38.500
Oh!

44:38.584 --> 44:40.250
That's sick.

44:40.334 --> 44:41.626
Yeah, I know.
A guy that age
trying to pick up

44:41.709 --> 44:43.375
someone like you.

44:43.459 --> 44:46.209
I have to leave.
My adult diapers
are bunching up.

44:47.292 --> 44:48.834
He just doesn't
want to leave.

44:48.918 --> 44:50.417
He's in here every night.
He's chatting me up.

44:50.500 --> 44:52.334
It's, like, you know...
It's pathetic.

44:52.417 --> 44:53.751
Yes.

44:53.834 --> 44:55.959
So, Greg...
Mmm?

44:56.042 --> 44:58.584
Is what I think's gonna
happen gonna happen?

44:58.667 --> 45:00.125
Mmm? 'Cause if it is,

45:00.209 --> 45:02.250
you're in for the wildest
night of your life.

45:03.250 --> 45:05.292
I'll be back around 10:00,
10:30. Is that good?

45:05.375 --> 45:07.334
I'll be waiting
in your room.

45:11.709 --> 45:13.709
I don't know.
Um...

45:13.792 --> 45:14.918
You don't know?

45:15.000 --> 45:16.417
No. No, I don't.

45:16.500 --> 45:19.000
Mmm. Too bad, Greg.

45:20.792 --> 45:22.500
(CHUCKLES SEDUCTIVELY)

45:22.584 --> 45:25.000
Because you don't know
what you'll be missing.

45:26.959 --> 45:29.876
Hey. Hey, look, look.
Wait. Ahem.

45:29.959 --> 45:32.459
My room number's
1402, okay?

45:32.542 --> 45:34.459
And I'll see you there
around 10:00, 10:30?

45:34.542 --> 45:35.500
But hang on. I don't
even know your name.

45:35.584 --> 45:36.459
What's your name?

45:37.918 --> 45:39.834
(CHUCKLES)
Mrs. Robinson.

45:39.918 --> 45:42.167
Mrs. Robinson. That's sexy.

45:42.250 --> 45:43.334
Hey.

45:43.417 --> 45:45.125
Nice to meet you,
Mrs. Robinson.

45:45.584 --> 45:47.083
See you later.

45:54.500 --> 45:57.250
We'll have the lobster,
the grilled salmon,

45:57.334 --> 45:59.584
and the creme brûlée,
please.

45:59.667 --> 46:01.834
And could you throw in
a couple of steaks?

46:01.918 --> 46:03.334
No dressing
on the salad,

46:03.417 --> 46:05.042
and we need this
as soon as possible.

46:05.125 --> 46:07.083
Thank you very much.
Bye-bye.

46:07.167 --> 46:09.125
You were really something
at the bar tonight.

46:09.209 --> 46:11.167
Oh, Henry, we are
going to have

46:11.250 --> 46:13.167
the best meal
of all time!

46:13.250 --> 46:14.542
I barely recognized you.

46:14.626 --> 46:17.209
You were so animalistic.
You were so hedonistic.

46:17.292 --> 46:19.250
You were so naughty.
Oh, you're so sweet, honey.

46:19.334 --> 46:22.000
Fries! Henry,
we didn't order any fries!

46:22.083 --> 46:24.042
Like you were some
cheap, tawdry sex machine.

46:24.125 --> 46:25.876
(RATTLING)
(BOTH GASP)

46:25.959 --> 46:27.792
Mrs. Robinson?

46:27.876 --> 46:31.083
Mrs. Robinson.
You in there? Hello.

46:31.167 --> 46:33.125
It's your agent.
I want to see you.

46:33.209 --> 46:35.250
Uh, I'll be right there...

46:35.334 --> 46:36.542
What's his name?

46:36.626 --> 46:37.792
...Greg!

46:37.876 --> 46:39.626
All right.
But I'm timing you

46:39.709 --> 46:41.918
on a very expensive
watch.

46:42.000 --> 46:43.626
Honey,
you have to hide.

46:43.709 --> 46:45.000
I will not hide!

46:45.083 --> 46:46.751
But this is his room!

46:46.834 --> 46:48.959
I am your husband!
GREG: Come on!

46:49.042 --> 46:51.959
All right, all right,
where? Here!

46:52.042 --> 46:54.542
Here. Just get...
Just scoot under the bed!

46:54.626 --> 46:56.083
It's too small!

46:56.167 --> 46:57.918
Get something
to camouflage...

46:58.000 --> 46:59.876
Uhh! Ooh!

46:59.959 --> 47:00.918
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

47:01.000 --> 47:02.167

we will not

55:39.792 --> 55:41.250
Nancy, tell them we will
not bear witness.

55:41.334 --> 55:42.500
No, we will not
bear witness.

55:42.584 --> 55:43.792
We don't know how
to bear witness.

55:43.876 --> 55:44.792
We've never...
We've never...
Shut up!

55:47.417 --> 55:48.667
Hey! I got it!
I got it!

Jump! Jump! Jump!

55:57.167 --> 55:58.209
Oh!

55:58.292 --> 56:00.417
Oh! Ow! Jeez!

56:00.500 --> 56:02.167
Are you okay?
Are you okay, baby?

56:02.250 --> 56:03.334
Let me catch my breath.

56:03.417 --> 56:04.667
Are you okay?

56:04.751 --> 56:05.876
Oh, Henry.
Oh, my God.

56:05.959 --> 56:06.918
I'm shaking.

56:07.000 --> 56:08.125
Do you believe
what just happened?

56:08.209 --> 56:09.542
I know, honey.

56:09.626 --> 56:11.459
Oh, my God.
You're so brave.

56:11.542 --> 56:13.500
Nah, not really.
Oh, you are, honey.

56:13.584 --> 56:15.751
You're a hero.
You saved our lives.

56:15.834 --> 56:17.459
Well, maybe
just a little bit.

56:17.542 --> 56:18.918
Come on. Are you okay?
Now come on. Huh?

56:19.042 --> 56:21.792
Henry, I saw my whole life
flash before my eyes.

56:21.876 --> 56:23.334
All I could think of was,

56:23.417 --> 56:25.000
I'll never see
my children again.

56:27.667 --> 56:28.959
Did you think
about me at all?

56:29.042 --> 56:31.709
Oh, there was
so little time.

56:32.626 --> 56:34.292
You had time for
your whole life

56:34.375 --> 56:36.500
to pass in front
of your eyes,
and I wasn't in it?

56:36.584 --> 56:38.584
Oh, Henry, please.
Don't be so sensitive.

56:38.667 --> 56:41.292
Of course I'm gonna think
about the children
at a time like this.

56:41.375 --> 56:43.042
They're my kids.
They need me.

56:43.125 --> 56:44.667
I'm all they've got.

56:44.751 --> 56:46.792
And who am I,
the anonymous sperm donor?

56:48.459 --> 56:50.417
Well, you might as well be.

56:50.500 --> 56:52.500
You asked for that one.

56:52.584 --> 56:53.876
What do you mean by that?

56:53.959 --> 56:57.417
Well, the way you're treating
Susan, for one, Henry.

56:57.500 --> 57:00.000
Let me...
Let me just say...

57:00.083 --> 57:03.083
You know,
we have to learn to think
about each other more,

57:03.167 --> 57:06.375
because the kids are gone,
and we're all we have.

57:06.459 --> 57:07.959
Well, you make that
sound appealing.

57:08.042 --> 57:09.167
Because unless
we find some way

57:09.250 --> 57:12.209
of relating to each other
and find some
common ground...

57:12.292 --> 57:13.584
We what?
You know, we...

57:13.667 --> 57:14.834
We are gonna...
What?

57:14.918 --> 57:16.417
What, Henry?
We're gonna get a divorce?

57:16.500 --> 57:17.542
Is that what you're
trying to say?

57:17.626 --> 57:19.959
What I'm saying
is that you have
to learn to let go,

57:20.042 --> 57:21.876
and you have to get
over this fear

57:21.959 --> 57:24.334
of not being able
to play mommy anymore.

57:27.542 --> 57:29.125
I want a divorce.

57:30.334 --> 57:31.751
Nancy, that's ridiculous.

57:31.834 --> 57:34.626
That's right.
I'm ridiculous,

57:34.709 --> 57:37.083
which is exactly what you
used to like about me.

57:37.167 --> 57:39.709
But you have become
incredibly stubborn

57:39.792 --> 57:42.000
and insensitive
and set in your ways.

57:42.083 --> 57:45.083
And after 27 years,
I've had enough!

57:47.459 --> 57:48.375
(CRYING)

57:51.083 --> 57:53.834
Well, you have really
been mistreated.

57:55.417 --> 57:58.500
While other husbands
are out getting drunk

57:58.584 --> 58:00.751
and having sex
with 18-year-olds,

58:00.834 --> 58:02.709
what does
your husband do?

58:02.792 --> 58:04.250
He's a little boring.

58:04.334 --> 58:06.083
He's a little
insensitive.

58:06.542 --> 58:07.876
Big deal.

58:39.083 --> 58:40.167
Oh.

58:42.459 --> 58:44.209
I'm sorry, honey.

58:48.667 --> 58:50.792
Oh, how did
we get here?

58:51.709 --> 58:53.459
We just got older,
that's all.

58:53.542 --> 58:54.918
I don't mind
getting older, Henry.

58:55.000 --> 58:56.918
Neither do I.
I don't.

58:58.500 --> 59:00.459
I don't even
want to be 17 again.

59:01.083 --> 59:02.792
Neither do I.

59:02.876 --> 59:05.417
That notion that
when you're younger,

59:05.500 --> 59:07.167
everything
is perfect.

59:09.125 --> 59:12.375
I wouldn't mind feeling
like I'm 17 sometimes.

59:12.459 --> 59:14.083
I wouldn't, either.

59:16.292 --> 59:17.876
How do we do that?

59:30.500 --> 59:32.000
Oh, Henry. When
we were younger,

59:32.083 --> 59:34.167
this would've been
one big adventure.

59:34.250 --> 59:35.792
Yeah, I know.

59:35.876 --> 59:37.834
Well, I don't know.

59:37.918 --> 59:39.167
We used to have fun.

59:39.250 --> 59:40.542
Yeah.

59:40.626 --> 59:42.876
Remember your
grandfather's house?

59:42.959 --> 59:44.542
We were in that
little stupid motel,

59:44.626 --> 59:45.709
and then we made
love all night

59:45.792 --> 59:47.042
'cause we were
so scared.

59:47.125 --> 59:48.542
That's where you
killed my grandfather.

59:48.626 --> 59:50.292
Oh, I did not.

59:50.375 --> 59:51.459
Yes, you did.
Henry.

59:51.542 --> 59:52.918
You can't wear that outfit

59:53.000 --> 59:54.459
around a man without
a single open artery.

59:54.542 --> 59:55.751
What outfit?

59:55.834 --> 59:58.667
The one with the black
tight pants

59:58.751 --> 1:00:00.709
with that daffodil patch.

1:00:00.792 --> 1:00:02.542
You remember that?
Yeah.

1:00:02.626 --> 1:00:04.292
What else?
What else?

1:00:04.375 --> 1:00:05.751
I remember you had that
heart-shaped blouse

1:00:05.834 --> 1:00:07.250
with that big heart thing.

1:00:07.334 --> 1:00:09.209
You looked like a person
who worked in a hospital.

1:00:09.292 --> 1:00:10.542

1:05:32.792 --> 1:05:35.167
and I need to use the phone
because I have
to arrange for bail.

1:05:35.250 --> 1:05:37.083
Public phones are right
down the hallway there.

1:05:37.167 --> 1:05:39.250
I know, but that'll take
at least an hour,

1:05:39.334 --> 1:05:41.375
and I don't have
that kind of time.

1:05:41.459 --> 1:05:42.876
And if I could just
use your phone,

1:05:42.959 --> 1:05:44.876
I promise I'll call
collect and I...

1:05:44.959 --> 1:05:46.500
Lady. Give me
a break, okay?

1:05:48.709 --> 1:05:49.834
Give you a break?

1:05:52.167 --> 1:05:53.667
Give you a break?

1:05:54.334 --> 1:05:55.459
(DING)
Hey!

1:05:56.417 --> 1:05:57.876
Let me share
something with you.

1:05:57.959 --> 1:05:59.542
In the last 24 hours,

1:05:59.626 --> 1:06:03.083
I have been rerouted,
mugged, evicted,

1:06:03.167 --> 1:06:05.042
chased by a dog,
kidnapped,

1:06:05.125 --> 1:06:06.459
chased by a horse,

1:06:06.542 --> 1:06:08.542
and seen in a compromising
position by the Mayor.

1:06:08.626 --> 1:06:10.209
I just found out
that my daughter

1:06:10.292 --> 1:06:11.459
is spending us
into the poorhouse

1:06:11.542 --> 1:06:13.417
and that my husband
has no job.

1:06:13.500 --> 1:06:16.542
I'm angry, I'm tired,
and I'm hungry,

1:06:16.626 --> 1:06:18.542
and I'm running
with the wolves!

1:06:18.626 --> 1:06:21.417
And right now, I am one
crazy bitch from Ohio!

1:06:21.500 --> 1:06:23.000
So why don't you
give me a break!

1:06:30.083 --> 1:06:32.334
Do I dial 9 to get out?

1:06:32.417 --> 1:06:34.626
Officer, I got the most
important meeting in 2 hours.

1:06:34.709 --> 1:06:36.083
Can't you just call
somebody or spea...

1:06:36.167 --> 1:06:38.250
What you makin'
all that noise for?

1:06:38.334 --> 1:06:41.417
Forget it. You can scream
in here till you croak.

1:06:41.500 --> 1:06:43.083
The whole damn thing
gives me a headache.

1:06:43.167 --> 1:06:44.751
I got one.

1:06:44.834 --> 1:06:46.626
Well, take an aspirin.

1:06:47.584 --> 1:06:49.626
Anything to shut
your mouth up.

1:06:50.292 --> 1:06:51.459
Thank you.

1:06:51.542 --> 1:06:52.626
(SIGH)

1:06:53.918 --> 1:06:55.000
Nobody home?

1:06:55.083 --> 1:06:56.918
No. My daughter's
not there.

1:06:57.000 --> 1:06:58.250
My son's somewhere
in London.

1:06:58.334 --> 1:06:59.876
I don't know anybody
else in New York.

1:07:00.709 --> 1:07:02.000
Well, where
are you staying?

1:07:02.083 --> 1:07:03.000
Can't your hotel
give you a loan?

1:07:03.083 --> 1:07:05.125
Oh, my God.

1:07:05.209 --> 1:07:06.459
The manager threw us
out of the hotel.

1:07:06.542 --> 1:07:08.334
He hates us.
He wouldn't eve...

1:07:15.792 --> 1:07:18.459
So you saw the
"do not disturb" sign
on the door.

1:07:18.542 --> 1:07:19.792
Yes.

1:07:19.876 --> 1:07:22.292
And then you knocked
to see if it was
supposed to be out there.

1:07:22.375 --> 1:07:24.125
Sir. I have
a call for you.

1:07:24.209 --> 1:07:25.334
Excuse me, Howard.

1:07:25.417 --> 1:07:28.334
I'll explain the rest
of your life to you
in a moment.

1:07:28.417 --> 1:07:30.250
Thank you so much,
Michelle.

1:07:30.334 --> 1:07:31.500
Good morning.
Mersault speaking.

1:07:31.584 --> 1:07:32.626
NANCY: <i>Mr. Mersault?</i>

1:07:32.709 --> 1:07:35.542
Hi. This is Nancy Clark
from Ohio.

1:07:35.626 --> 1:07:37.584
You threw us out of
your hotel last night.

1:07:37.667 --> 1:07:39.042
<i>How are you?</i>

1:07:39.125 --> 1:07:40.209
Oh, I'm very well,
thank you.

1:07:40.292 --> 1:07:41.542
How nice of you
to stay in touch.

1:07:41.626 --> 1:07:43.751
I wish all our freeloaders
were as conscientious.

1:07:43.834 --> 1:07:45.709
<i>Well, as much as I would
like to chew the fat,</i>

1:07:45.792 --> 1:07:47.375
this really isn't
a courtesy call.

1:07:47.459 --> 1:07:49.000
I need you
to do me a favor.

1:07:49.083 --> 1:07:50.042
<i>Mrs. Clark, let me explain.</i>

1:07:51.250 --> 1:07:53.626
If you are a paying
guest at this hotel,

1:07:53.709 --> 1:07:55.167
I fawn, I grovel.

1:07:55.250 --> 1:07:57.209
I am, in fact,
your very plaything.

1:07:57.292 --> 1:07:59.334
But if you're not a guest,
you do not exist.

1:07:59.417 --> 1:08:01.000
So there is no need
for me to talk to you.

1:08:01.083 --> 1:08:02.292
Oh, I think you're
definitely

1:08:02.375 --> 1:08:03.876
gonna want to speak
to me, Mr. Mersault.

1:08:03.959 --> 1:08:05.125
Why on earth
would that be?

1:08:05.209 --> 1:08:06.667
Because last night
at the hotel,

1:08:06.751 --> 1:08:09.459
you looked so fabulous

1:08:09.542 --> 1:08:12.500
in that wonderful
full-length sable coat.

1:08:12.584 --> 1:08:15.000
<i>And those stiletto heels
were absolutely...</i>

1:08:16.167 --> 1:08:19.751
Go away. Yes?

1:08:19.834 --> 1:08:23.709
And I must tell you
that I have never seen
a man kick so high.

1:08:24.459 --> 1:08:25.918
And after they
send you to jail,

1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:28.209
<i>you can do
your little act
for all the prisoners.</i>

1:08:28.292 --> 1:08:29.584
<i>They'll love it.</i>

1:08:29.667 --> 1:08:31.334
Congratulations,
Mrs. Clark.

1:08:31.417 --> 1:08:33.042
I had an intuition
you'd be good at blackmail.

1:08:33.125 --> 1:08:35.834
So, um, how may I be
of service to you?

1:08:35.918 --> 1:08:37.626
I need bail money
at the 15th Precinct,

1:08:37.709 --> 1:08:39.167
and I need it here
right now.

1:08:39.250 --> 1:08:40.876
And bring some muffins.

1:08:40.959 --> 1:08:42.959
But, of course.

1:08:43.042 --> 1:08:44.042
Muffins.

1:08:47.209 --> 1:08:49.584
The presidential suite
comes with the compliments
of the hotel,

1:08:49.667 --> 1:08:51.125
as, of course,
does the limo.

1:08:51.209 --> 1:08:52.542
Or should I say
getaway car?

1:08:52.626 --> 1:08:53.667
Now before we get
to the hotel,

1:08:53.751 --> 1:08:55.667
I'd just like you to sign
this document, if you would,

1:08:55.751 --> 1:08:58.834
agreeing never to discuss,
disclose, or reveal

1:08:58.918 --> 1:09:01.292
the incident at the hotel
when I was, in fact,

1:09:01.375 --> 1:09:04.334
rehearsing for the hotel
employees' follies.

1:09:04.417 --> 1:09:06.876
Thank you so much.
Very good.

1:09:06.959 --> 1:09:08.292
You look great.

1:09:08.375 --> 1:09:09.918
Thanks, sweetie.

1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:11.542
You look really great.

1:09:11.626 --> 1:09:13.459
Thanks.
Doesn't she look great?

1:09:13.542 --> 1:09:14.834
Well, I wouldn't
mind the blouse.

1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:17.542
No, not the blouse.
I mean, she just
looks great.

1:09:18.417 --> 1:09:20.792
(WHISPERS) She's got
a great ass.

1:09:20.876 --> 1:09:22.334
Henry?

1:09:22.417 --> 1:09:23.959
Well, it is. It's just
always there for me.

1:09:24.042 --> 1:09:25.250
Oh.

1:09:25.334 --> 1:09:27.125
It's been a wellspring
of joy, really.

1:09:27.209 --> 1:09:28.918
A what?
What do you think?

1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:30.417
I think it's a private, uh...

1:09:30.500 --> 1:09:32.500
Well, come on. I mean,
everybody knows.

1:09:32.584 --> 1:09:33.667
It's the elephant
in the room,

1:09:33.751 --> 1:09:34.667
and now we're finally
talking about it.

1:09:34.751 --> 1:09:37.000
Henry, what is
wrong with you?

1:09:37.083 --> 1:09:38.459
Nothing.
Uh?

1:09:39.876 --> 1:09:41.709
I just feel frisky,
that's all.

1:09:42.626 --> 1:09:43.834
You feel frisky?

1:09:43.918 --> 1:09:46.000
Frisky. Frisky.

1:09:46.083 --> 1:09:47.167
Say the word "frisky."

1:09:47.250 --> 1:09:48.292
Frisky.

1:09:48.375 --> 1:09:50.167
Frisky.
Yeah.

1:09:50.250 --> 1:09:51.292
Say "frisky" again.
Frisky, Henry.

1:09:51.375 --> 1:09:52.626
Frisky. Say "frisky."

1:09:53.334 --> 1:09:54.334
Say the word "frisky."

1:09:54.417 --> 1:09:55.542
Frisky.

1:09:55.626 --> 1:09:57.459
Frisky. Say "frisky."

1:09:58.042 --> 1:09:59.542
Frisky.

1:09:59.626 --> 1:10:00.792
Frisky. Say the word
"frisky." it's fun.

1:10:00.876 --> 1:10:02.876
Frisky. Yes, yes.
It is rather fun.

1:10:02.959 --> 1:10:04.584
(LAUGHING)

1:10:06.417 --> 1:10:08.292
Say, is there a playground
or something nearby,

1:10:08.375 --> 1:10:10.918
say, maybe with swings
or monkey bars?

1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:13.167
There's a very well-equipped
health club at the hotel

1:10:13.250 --> 1:10:15.375
which you're welcome to use
once you've signed...

1:10:15.459 --> 1:10:17.500
Yecch! Yecch. Health club.
Eggh!

1:10:17.584 --> 1:10:19.083
Oh, my God. Henry.

1:10:19.167 --> 1:10:20.626
Henry, look at me.

1:10:20.709 --> 1:10:21.876
Your eyes look
really funny.

1:10:21.959 --> 1:10:23.292
Did you eat or drink
anything in jail?

1:10:23.375 --> 1:10:24.834
No.
Mmm, you didn't?

1:10:24.918 --> 1:10:26.375
No. I just...
I had an aspirin.

1:10:26.459 --> 1:10:27.500
Are you sure
it was an aspirin?

1:10:28.667 --> 1:10:30.042
A prisoner
gave it to me.

1:10:30.125 --> 1:10:32.209
Oh, well, if a prisoner
gave it to him.

1:10:32.292 --> 1:10:33.626
Oh!

1:10:33.709 --> 1:10:35.334
Can you pull over?
Would you pull over?

1:10:35.417 --> 1:10:36.417
No. Don't pull over.

1:10:36.500 --> 1:10:38.584
Don't pull over.
Pullover.

1:10:38.667 --> 1:10:40.000
Pullover.
Like a sweater.

1:10:40.083 --> 1:10:41.459
A pullover sweater.

1:10:41.542 --> 1:10:43.459
And it's the same
as "pull over."

1:10:43.542 --> 1:10:46.000
To pull over, and yet,

1:10:46.083 --> 1:10:47.626

1:12:51.751 --> 1:12:52.751
Right.

1:12:52.834 --> 1:12:54.667
I am an advertising ma...

(MUMBLING INTO PILLOW)
Henry?

1:12:57.042 --> 1:12:58.292
Henry, no.

1:12:58.375 --> 1:12:59.751
You have
to get dressed.

1:12:59.834 --> 1:13:01.167
All right. All right.
I'm getting dressed.

1:13:01.250 --> 1:13:03.125
Now... Think.

1:13:03.209 --> 1:13:05.042
I have an idea, baby.

1:13:05.125 --> 1:13:07.709
What is the most unused
advertising space
in the world?

1:13:07.792 --> 1:13:09.375
What?
The human tongue.

1:13:09.459 --> 1:13:10.834
It's always
hanging out.

1:13:10.918 --> 1:13:13.542
People looking through
restaurant windows
and drooling

1:13:13.626 --> 1:13:14.709
and guys looking
at girls.

1:13:14.792 --> 1:13:15.876
That's
advertising space.

1:13:15.959 --> 1:13:17.375
It'd be so easy
to write on there.

1:13:17.459 --> 1:13:19.000
So-and-so's breath mints.

1:13:19.083 --> 1:13:21.876
And dogs. Their tongues
are always hanging out.

1:13:21.959 --> 1:13:23.918
They wouldn't mind
a little tattoo
that says "Alpo."

1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:25.500
Would you
write this down?

1:13:25.584 --> 1:13:27.751
Don't worry. I never
forget a good idea.

1:13:27.834 --> 1:13:29.459
Well, say it back to me.
Say it back.

1:13:29.542 --> 1:13:31.334
Henry. It's time
to take a shower.

1:13:31.417 --> 1:13:33.250
Take a shower. All right.
Yes. It's time
to take a shower.

1:13:33.334 --> 1:13:36.667
Okay, baby.
Your little genius
is gonna take a shower.

I got it.

We're gonna make it.

1:14:32.876 --> 1:14:34.125

you're gonna get the job.

Get the job?
Yes, you are.

You look good,
sweetheart.

Okay. Button up your coat.

Okay, Henry.

It is right.

do this.

No, Henry, you're

All righty.

Okay, Henry, now I
want you to visualize
getting off the elevator.

1:16:06.250 --> 1:16:07.459
I'm visualizing.
Okay.

1:16:07.542 --> 1:16:09.167
Coming off the elevator.

That feels good. It's
a different temperature.

Is it, honey? Come on.

1:16:12.792 --> 1:16:13.834
You're gonna make it, Henry.

1:16:13.918 --> 1:16:15.584

Come on. Come on, baby.

1:16:22.250 --> 1:16:24.751
I can't do this.
I can't do this.
I'm just burned out.

1:16:24.834 --> 1:16:26.083
I'm just going through
the motions.

1:16:26.167 --> 1:16:28.000
I can't get out.
I know what he means.

Paul.

We just can't
do this anymore.

Henry, Henry,
don't be irresponsible.

1:16:34.292 --> 1:16:37.334
I know that you took
a hallucinogenic in prison.

1:16:37.417 --> 1:16:39.918
But this does not mean
that you can't make an effort.

1:16:40.000 --> 1:16:41.918
I can't.
We can't!

1:16:42.000 --> 1:16:43.500
You're not helping!

1:16:43.584 --> 1:16:45.918
Henry, who are you
gonna listen to,

1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:49.417
your loving, trusting wife
of 27 years or this guy?

1:16:49.500 --> 1:16:52.209
He understands me,
and you just can't
handle that, can you?

1:16:52.292 --> 1:16:54.167
We're one now.

1:16:54.250 --> 1:16:55.292
Let's go, honey.

1:16:55.375 --> 1:16:57.542
Yeah. Okay, good, Henry.

1:16:59.667 --> 1:17:01.167
Let's go.

1:17:03.125 --> 1:17:05.000
So I go, "No way."
And he goes, "Oh, so way."

1:17:05.083 --> 1:17:06.459
Excuse me.

1:17:06.542 --> 1:17:08.042
I go, "You are
totally stupid."

1:17:08.125 --> 1:17:09.334
Excuse me.

1:17:09.417 --> 1:17:10.709
Hold on. Can I help you?

1:17:10.792 --> 1:17:13.042
I'm Henry Clark
to see Lisa Tobin.

1:17:13.125 --> 1:17:16.167
Oh, you're Henry Clark.
I called your house in Ohio,

1:17:16.250 --> 1:17:17.626
and I tried leaving a message
at the hotel for you,

1:17:17.709 --> 1:17:19.083
but they said you
hadn't checked in.

1:17:19.167 --> 1:17:20.334
The meeting was
moved to 9:00.

1:17:21.334 --> 1:17:22.417
Are you serious?

1:17:24.042 --> 1:17:25.292
We didn't get that message.

1:17:25.375 --> 1:17:26.542
There's nothing
I can do.

1:17:26.626 --> 1:17:29.584
I know, but, you know,
we had trouble
getting into the hotel,

1:17:29.667 --> 1:17:30.709
we didn't get
our messages.

1:17:30.792 --> 1:17:33.042
The manager's
a transvestite.

1:17:33.125 --> 1:17:34.792
Ms. Tobin is preparing for
a meeting with some clients.

1:17:34.876 --> 1:17:36.334
Then she flies to London
for a week.

1:17:36.417 --> 1:17:38.083
Sorry.

1:17:38.167 --> 1:17:40.167
There must be
something you can do.
I mean...

1:17:40.250 --> 1:17:42.918
See, this is a sign.
It's over.

1:17:43.000 --> 1:17:44.250
Henry,
don't say that.

1:17:44.334 --> 1:17:45.751
Nancy, look out there.

1:17:45.834 --> 1:17:48.083
It's an entire city
saying, "Go home."

1:17:48.167 --> 1:17:49.751
You know what it says
on the Statue of Liberty?

1:17:49.834 --> 1:17:51.417
"Give me your tired,
give me your poor."

1:17:51.500 --> 1:17:53.417
"Give me everybody
but Henry and Nancy Clark."

1:17:53.500 --> 1:17:54.918
Henry, you're hungry.

1:17:55.000 --> 1:17:56.250
If I just
get you a cracker,

1:17:56.334 --> 1:17:57.709
you'll be filled
with hope again.

1:17:57.792 --> 1:17:59.167
No, I'll just be
filled with cracker.

1:17:59.250 --> 1:18:01.500
It's over.
What about marrow-sucking?

1:18:01.584 --> 1:18:03.209
What about
embracing life?

1:18:03.292 --> 1:18:05.292
Nancy, we're
too old for that.

1:18:09.584 --> 1:18:10.584
Okay.

1:18:11.918 --> 1:18:13.751
All right, Henry.

1:18:13.834 --> 1:18:15.459
The plane leaves at 2:30.

1:18:15.542 --> 1:18:17.125
I'm gonna be on it.

1:18:17.959 --> 1:18:19.292
I'm gonna go back
to the hotel.

1:18:20.209 --> 1:18:21.959
I have just enough energy to

1:18:22.042 --> 1:18:24.375
steal some towels from
the presidential suite.

1:18:24.459 --> 1:18:25.876
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

1:18:25.959 --> 1:18:27.417
Well, Henry...

1:18:28.709 --> 1:18:30.292
I guess New York won.

1:18:38.959 --> 1:18:40.334
New York won.

1:18:43.459 --> 1:18:44.751
New York won?

1:18:49.292 --> 1:18:52.000
Uh-huh.
No, it's permanent.

1:18:52.083 --> 1:18:53.167
You never have
to wax again.

1:18:53.250 --> 1:18:55.250
Excuse me.
Of course it hurts.

1:18:55.334 --> 1:18:56.667
Oh, it is so
totally worth it.

1:18:56.751 --> 1:18:58.500
I mean, what,
with global warming,

1:18:58.584 --> 1:18:59.959
you're gonna be in a bathing
suit all year long.

1:19:00.042 --> 1:19:01.667
I'm sorry.
This is an emergency.
If I could just...

1:19:01.751 --> 1:19:03.500
Gimme a break, okay?

1:19:03.584 --> 1:19:04.834
Sorry. Go ahead.

1:19:04.918 --> 1:19:06.459
Give you a break?

1:19:07.375 --> 1:19:08.667
Give you a break?

1:19:09.459 --> 1:19:12.334
Hey! Listen.

1:19:12.417 --> 1:19:15.000
In the past 24 hours,
I have destroyed a car,

1:19:15.083 --> 1:19:16.459
been thrown out of a hotel,

1:19:16.542 --> 1:19:18.417
forced to reveal my
most intimate secrets

1:19:18.500 --> 1:19:20.417
to a group of nymphomaniacs
and masturbators,

1:19:20.500 --> 1:19:22.417
watched my wife
seduce a man for dinner,

1:19:22.500 --> 1:19:23.500
threatened with divorce,

1:19:23.584 --> 1:19:25.209
arrested for
public urination,

1:19:25.292 --> 1:19:28.042
and drugged by Jacko,
my new prison pal.

1:19:28.125 --> 1:19:29.751
I have a house,
and a mortgage,

1:19:29.834 --> 1:19:32.459
and a son in college,
and a daughter
in the theater.

1:19:32.542 --> 1:19:34.792
And I'm one of those nice,
quiet Midwestern guys

1:19:34.876 --> 1:19:36.751
that no one expects to snap,

1:19:36.834 --> 1:19:39.500
but when we do,
watch it, baby!

1:19:40.292 --> 1:19:42.000
Come on in.
Meet the team.

1:19:42.083 --> 1:19:45.042
Bill, Rita, David, Michael,
this is Henry Clark,

1:19:45.125 --> 1:19:47.375
formally of Sellinski
Advertising in Ohio.

1:19:47.459 --> 1:19:48.626
Hi. How are you?

1:19:48.709 --> 1:19:50.375
He was scheduled
for 9:00.

1:19:50.459 --> 1:19:53.042
9:00, huh? Still on
Central Standard Time?

1:19:53.125 --> 1:19:55.209
Well, actually, Ohio
is Eastern Standard Time.

1:19:55.292 --> 1:19:56.500
A lot of people think
it's Central, but it's not.

1:19:58.375 --> 1:19:59.500
Although Central Standard Time

1:19:59.584 --> 1:20:01.417
is a very, very
good time zone.

1:20:01.500 --> 1:20:04.292
It's just...
It's not too early,
it's not too late.

1:20:05.209 --> 1:20:07.250
It's... It's just Central.

1:20:09.876 --> 1:20:11.083
I don't get the joke.

1:20:12.792 --> 1:20:13.834
(CRYING)

1:20:20.042 --> 1:20:22.459
Mr. Clark, your portfolio
is terrific.

1:20:22.542 --> 1:20:24.876
But in an hour, we have
to pitch a follow-up

1:20:24.959 --> 1:20:26.042
to the "I Love New York"
campaign,

1:20:26.125 --> 1:20:27.792
and we're having
big problems.

1:20:27.876 --> 1:20:29.250
I wish our timing
had been better,

1:20:29.334 --> 1:20:31.667
but thanks for coming up
and good luck.

1:20:34.667 --> 1:20:35.626
Oh.

1:20:40.083 --> 1:20:41.459
Thank you.

1:20:53.918 --> 1:20:56.000
I think we should start
with <i>New York, New York,</i>

1:20:56.083 --> 1:20:58.542
and then pull back...

1:20:58.626 --> 1:21:01.042
'Cause that way,
it's definitely a start.

1:21:01.125 --> 1:21:03.167
It's big. It's bold.
I see that...

1:21:03.250 --> 1:21:05.209
Do you know what
your problem is?

1:21:06.542 --> 1:21:08.292
What did you say?

1:21:08.375 --> 1:21:11.667
I said, "Do you know
what your problem is?"

1:21:12.626 --> 1:21:14.167
No. What's my problem?

1:21:14.250 --> 1:21:17.125
You live here.
You're jaded.

1:21:18.042 --> 1:21:19.834
What you need is
a fresh perspective

1:21:19.918 --> 1:21:23.876
from an outsider
from, say, Ohio.

1:21:25.167 --> 1:21:26.500
Because you
have forgotten

1:21:26.584 --> 1:21:29.042
just how amazing
this city is.

1:21:29.125 --> 1:21:31.250
I have had more
experiences in this city

1:21:31.334 --> 1:21:33.626
than many people
who have lived here
their whole lives.

1:21:33.709 --> 1:21:36.542
I mean, I met
colorful characters.

1:21:36.626 --> 1:21:39.667
I've taken
a breathtaking cab ride
through Central Park.

1:21:39.751 --> 1:21:42.918
I climbed to the top
of a luxury hotel.

1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:44.709
Not in the elevator,

1:21:44.792 --> 1:21:48.000
actually on the hotel.

1:21:48.083 --> 1:21:50.709
And then, I fell...

1:21:52.125 --> 1:21:55.125
...in love with my wife
all over again

1:21:55.209 --> 1:21:56.584
at Tavern on the Green,

1:21:57.125 --> 1:22:00.626
on the actual green itself.

1:22:00.709 --> 1:22:04.584
And then I had sex
in front of the Mayor.

1:22:04.667 --> 1:22:08.167
I mean, where else
can something
like this happen?

1:22:08.250 --> 1:22:10.709
Only in New York!

1:22:18.334 --> 1:22:19.584
What did you just say?

1:22:21.375 --> 1:22:22.626
You mean the whole thing
or the tag line

1:22:22.709 --> 1:22:24.709
for your new campaign,
"Only In New York"?

1:22:24.792 --> 1:22:27.167
Which, incidentally,
I copyrighted just
before I came up here,

1:22:27.250 --> 1:22:29.042
along with the visual
of the Statue of Liberty

1:22:29.125 --> 1:22:31.500
giving the high five
to a family of tourists.

1:22:32.250 --> 1:22:34.209
Oh, this guy's very good.

1:22:34.292 --> 1:22:35.876
Can I have a doughnut?

1:22:37.292 --> 1:22:39.125
Now, when
the Princess arrives,

1:22:39.209 --> 1:22:42.918
try not to be alarmed
by her appearance,
which is hideous.

1:22:43.000 --> 1:22:44.959
Now do you have all
the Clarks' luggage?

1:22:45.042 --> 1:22:46.417
I think there's also
a garment bag.

1:22:46.500 --> 1:22:48.125
Well, if it's not
here in 60 seconds,

1:22:48.209 --> 1:22:49.459
I shall instruct
the hotel nurse

1:22:49.542 --> 1:22:51.584
to give you
a lethal injection.

1:22:53.042 --> 1:22:54.918
Mrs. Clark,
good afternoon!

1:22:55.000 --> 1:22:57.042
Your yellow chariot awaits,

1:22:57.125 --> 1:22:58.667
and you have
a glorious day for flying.

1:22:58.751 --> 1:22:59.667
Up, up, and away.

1:22:59.751 --> 1:23:00.918
Oh, barf.

1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:03.167
(LAUGHS)
My sentiments exactly.

1:23:03.250 --> 1:23:04.626
If you see my husband,
would you do me a favor

1:23:04.709 --> 1:23:06.083
and give him
that ticket, please?

1:23:06.167 --> 1:23:07.250
But, of course.
Such a good idea

1:23:07.334 --> 1:23:08.584
to get a head start
to the airport.

1:23:08.667 --> 1:23:09.459
Visit those fine shops.

1:23:09.542 --> 1:23:10.834
Get to know
a Hare Krishna, perhaps.

1:23:10.918 --> 1:23:12.167
Close the door, please.

1:23:12.250 --> 1:23:13.918
Hey! Hey, baby, hey.

1:23:14.667 --> 1:23:15.751
Hold it. Hold it. Hey!

1:23:15.834 --> 1:23:16.792
Hey, baby, baby,
don't go!

1:23:16.876 --> 1:23:18.584
Go! Go! Go!

1:23:18.667 --> 1:23:20.250
Don't go! Don't go!

1:23:20.334 --> 1:23:22.959
Don't go! Don't go!
Hey, hey!

1:23:23.042 --> 1:23:24.125
Come here! Come here!

1:23:24.209 --> 1:23:26.751
Henry!
Come here! Come here!

1:23:26.834 --> 1:23:27.918
What... What...
What is it?

1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:31.500
Okay. Now this is champagne,
and that is the limousine,

1:23:31.584 --> 1:23:33.667
and this is what
we're celebrating.

1:23:33.751 --> 1:23:35.167
What?

1:23:35.250 --> 1:23:36.918
It's the key to my new office.
I got the job.

1:23:37.000 --> 1:23:38.626
Henry, you got the job!

1:23:38.709 --> 1:23:40.542
We're New Yorkers now.
We're New Yorkers now!

1:23:40.626 --> 1:23:42.417
We're never gonna leave!
We're never gonna leave!

1:23:42.500 --> 1:23:44.167
Oh, no. Please, God, no.

1:23:44.250 --> 1:23:46.792
And I got you
something, too.

1:23:46.876 --> 1:23:48.542
Oh, honey...

1:23:48.626 --> 1:23:50.125
You didn't have
to do this.

1:23:50.209 --> 1:23:51.250
I know, I know,
but I did.
Oh, my...

1:23:52.209 --> 1:23:55.417
Oh, you got me
a spare key.

1:23:55.500 --> 1:23:56.500
It's the key
to your office.

1:23:57.584 --> 1:23:59.792
Henry, are you
still high?

1:23:59.876 --> 1:24:01.542
They want me to bring in
my own creative team.

1:24:01.626 --> 1:24:03.834
I can hire anyone I want,
and I want you.

1:24:03.918 --> 1:24:05.709
I want my partner back.

1:24:05.792 --> 1:24:07.167
Oh, Henry.

1:24:07.250 --> 1:24:08.459
I mean, all the
best things in my life

1:24:08.542 --> 1:24:09.542
have happened
because of you,

1:24:09.626 --> 1:24:11.876
the marriage
and the kids and work.

1:24:11.959 --> 1:24:13.209
And this is
how I'm happiest.

1:24:13.292 --> 1:24:15.292
(LAUGHS) This is crazy!

1:24:15.375 --> 1:24:17.083
No, no, no, no,
this makes sense.

1:24:17.167 --> 1:24:18.667
You want to know
what my version
of marrow-sucking is?

1:24:18.751 --> 1:24:19.876
What?

1:24:19.959 --> 1:24:21.959
It's being with you.

1:24:22.042 --> 1:24:23.626
That's how I suck.

1:24:23.709 --> 1:24:25.083
Oh, Henry.

1:24:30.834 --> 1:24:31.959
(SIGHS)

1:24:32.042 --> 1:24:33.500
What's it pay?

1:24:33.584 --> 1:24:36.083
Excuse me.
Are you going to
the airport or not?

1:24:36.167 --> 1:24:37.626
Why? We live here.

1:24:37.709 --> 1:24:38.667
Oh!

1:24:42.292 --> 1:24:43.584
Only in New York.

1:24:45.876 --> 1:24:49.792
So, I take it you won't
be checking out today.

1:24:49.876 --> 1:24:51.417
Or perhaps ever.

1:24:52.584 --> 1:24:54.417
Barry, get the bags.

1:24:55.083 --> 1:24:56.626
Bags!
What?

1:24:56.709 --> 1:24:58.042
The bags!
Where are they?

1:24:58.125 --> 1:24:59.709
They're in the cab!
In the cab?

1:24:59.792 --> 1:25:00.834
My God.

1:25:02.292 --> 1:25:04.292
I think I'm beginning
to like them.

1:25:04.375 --> 1:25:06.083
Taxi!

1:25:06.167 --> 1:25:08.375
Why do they paint
them all yellow?

1:25:14.334 --> 1:25:16.083
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

1:25:16.167 --> 1:25:17.542
(MOUTHING)

1:25:23.459 --> 1:25:24.417
Congratulations.

1:25:24.500 --> 1:25:25.792
She's good,
isn't she?

1:25:25.876 --> 1:25:27.584
You should be proud.

1:25:27.667 --> 1:25:30.417
Isn't the theater
magical? What?

1:25:30.500 --> 1:25:32.334
Are those my earrings?

1:25:32.417 --> 1:25:35.083
