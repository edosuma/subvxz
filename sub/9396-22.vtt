00:00.323 --> 00:01.769
Previously on One Tree Hill.

00:01.819 --> 00:03.054
I have a right to my daughter.

00:03.703 --> 00:04.641
You’re not getting her.

00:10.605 --> 00:12.029
Petition for annulment?

00:12.592 --> 00:14.250
It’ll be like the marriage never happened.

00:14.994 --> 00:18.167
There’s... no way that he signed this.

00:18.290 --> 00:19.382
It’s over, Haley.

00:20.994 --> 00:21.932
Jake Jagielski.

00:23.048 --> 00:24.744
You have the right to remain silent.

00:25.746 --> 00:26.600
I love you.

00:27.234 --> 00:28.332
I love you, too.

00:29.044 --> 00:29.960
Did we have fun?

00:30.484 --> 00:31.381
You tell me.

00:37.129 --> 00:37.961
It’s okay, Deb...

00:39.277 --> 00:40.440
I’ll be here when you get out.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074

00:49.508 --> 00:50.930
I’m coming home tomorrow, okay?

00:51.436 --> 00:52.682
Don’t come home, Haley.

00:52.807 --> 00:53.592
Nathan...

00:53.777 --> 00:55.172
Coz I don’t want you to.

01:48.278 --> 01:49.841
And Hansel said to Gretel...

01:51.186 --> 01:53.032
let us drop these breadcrumbs...

01:54.308 --> 01:56.440
so that together we find our way home.

01:57.878 --> 02:00.593
Because losing our way would be the most cruel of things.

02:02.775 --> 02:03.512
This year...

02:04.645 --> 02:05.801
I lost my way.

02:10.727 --> 02:13.142
And losing your way on a journey is unfortunate.

02:14.385 --> 02:16.412
But, losing your reason for the journey...

02:17.315 --> 02:18.811
is a fate more cruel.

02:21.568 --> 02:23.391
The journey lasted eight months.

02:24.407 --> 02:26.111
Sometimes I travelled alone...

02:28.246 --> 02:30.552
Sometimes, there were others who took the wheel...

02:32.178 --> 02:33.332
and took my heart.

02:35.567 --> 02:37.431
But when the destination was reached...

02:38.095 --> 02:39.782
it wasn’t me who arrived...

02:41.588 --> 02:42.862
it wasn’t me at all.

02:55.008 --> 02:57.921
And once you lose yourself, you have two choices:

02:58.027 --> 02:58.823
Bye!

03:03.265 --> 03:05.131
Find the person you used to be...

03:08.736 --> 03:10.583
or lose that person completely.

03:12.357 --> 03:15.711
Because, sometimes, you have to step outside of the person you’ve been.

03:16.378 --> 03:18.700
And remember the person you were meant to be.

03:19.648 --> 03:21.091
The person you wanted to be.

03:22.398 --> 03:25.803
- Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy...
- The person you are.

03:27.556 --> 03:30.390
Tree Hill student council is pleased to welcome-

03:30.605 --> 03:34.742
No. As president of the student council, I promised you guys a good time...

03:35.538 --> 03:38.173
I’m Brooke Davis and I’m an idiot, but, please welcome-

03:39.075 --> 03:40.962
Jimmy Eat World, that’s a great idea!

03:41.058 --> 03:42.293
Brooke, it’ll probably never happen.

03:42.416 --> 03:46.361
Peyton Elizabeth Sawyer, you got The Wreckers and Pelthead to come and play;

03:46.428 --> 03:48.743
you can totally land Jimmy Eat World and when you do,

03:48.796 --> 03:51.673
I promise I won’t break up with you to run off and join their tour.

03:54.858 --> 03:55.982
That’s it, isn’t it?

03:56.826 --> 04:00.670
That’s why your heart’s not totally in to finding a great band for the end of the school year.

04:01.145 --> 04:02.273
Haley and Nathan.

04:04.245 --> 04:06.261
Yeah. That, and-

04:07.615 --> 04:08.480
Jake.

04:09.486 --> 04:11.521
You’ve been calling my attorneys a lot.

04:12.078 --> 04:13.270
I thought I could help.

04:13.368 --> 04:15.281
Well, you just pissed them off.

04:17.464 --> 04:19.603
There are two tragedy’s in life:-

04:20.158 --> 04:22.691
one is to lose your heart’s desire.

04:23.188 --> 04:25.133
The other is to gain it.

04:25.638 --> 04:30.212
Now the little that Shaw realised at the time that his words would be the basis of your final.

04:30.888 --> 04:34.973
I’d like you to write an essay on the meaning of Shaw’s quote.

04:35.267 --> 04:37.283
It’s due on Monday...

04:37.396 --> 04:39.522
and then your school year will be over.

04:48.455 --> 04:51.130
I guess Haley’s not coming back after all, huh?

05:03.265 --> 05:04.273
Game to eleven?

05:05.148 --> 05:06.553
I’ll give you ten and the ball.

05:09.526 --> 05:10.373
Game.

05:11.328 --> 05:12.132
See?

05:13.297 --> 05:14.650
You’ll be back in no time.

05:14.788 --> 05:17.020
Shooting weak-ass jump shots: that’s your game.

05:17.715 --> 05:19.470
I can hardly jump, man.

05:20.046 --> 05:22.743
Look, I know you don’t wanna hear this, but if you blow off this English final,

05:22.817 --> 05:26.890
you’re not gonna even be eligible to shoot the... ‘weak-ass jump shots’.

05:29.528 --> 05:32.123
It’s about loss. I can help you if you want.

05:33.557 --> 05:35.202
You don’t think I can write about loss?

05:41.875 --> 05:43.083
Hey sexy!

05:44.486 --> 05:45.281
What’s wrong?

05:45.647 --> 05:48.561
I’m dead. I tanked my calculus final.

05:48.747 --> 05:50.782
Are you sure? Maybe you did okay.

05:50.865 --> 05:53.942
Erica, we hung out all week and I was totally unprepared.

05:54.266 --> 05:57.072
And you can’t exactly bluff your way through math, you know?

05:58.368 --> 06:00.350
God, my parents are gonna kill me.

06:04.676 --> 06:05.240
Hey.

06:06.215 --> 06:06.791
Hey.

06:07.966 --> 06:09.781
You wanna go on a road trip this weekend?

06:10.376 --> 06:11.391
Okay, where?

06:11.637 --> 06:13.362
New York, to see Haley.

06:13.988 --> 06:17.452
Alright, odd I know, coming from me, but we do have finals.

06:17.606 --> 06:18.452
The essay.

06:18.765 --> 06:22.822
I’ll bring my laptop. Whoever sits shotgun can do the typing; whaddaya say, huh?

06:24.238 --> 06:25.391
And why Haley?

06:25.757 --> 06:26.622
Why now?

06:26.796 --> 06:28.210
Because we started the year together...

06:29.076 --> 06:31.082
and I can’t end it without seeing her.

06:37.168 --> 06:39.741
Okay. I’ll go, we can talk.

06:39.828 --> 06:40.801
We need to talk.

06:41.117 --> 06:42.063
What’s wrong?

06:42.628 --> 06:46.180
Well, I don’t want you to be alarmed, but, my mother took a spill in New Zealand.

06:47.167 --> 06:48.552
That’s terrible.

06:49.386 --> 06:50.682
She’s asked me to come home.

06:51.287 --> 06:52.450
Well, you have to.

06:54.535 --> 06:57.340
And I don’t know how long for, coz there’s a bit more to it.

07:02.977 --> 07:05.162
I may have a problem coming back into the States;

07:05.937 --> 07:08.603
I’m not a citizen and, well,

07:10.248 --> 07:11.870
Dan’s trying to get me deported.

07:16.417 --> 07:17.300
Deported?!

07:17.697 --> 07:18.961
What is wrong with you?!

07:19.325 --> 07:21.550
Why can't you simply stay out of my life?!

07:21.837 --> 07:22.890
Why can’t you?

07:22.966 --> 07:26.713
Oh, please, I’ve been ignoring you for the last seventeen years!

07:26.785 --> 07:27.603
Have you?

07:28.697 --> 07:31.091
Coz you’ve been coming around quite a bit, Karen.

07:31.598 --> 07:33.803
I mean, with all your anger and outrage.

07:34.655 --> 07:35.913
Some would call it...

07:37.165 --> 07:38.033
passion.

07:38.406 --> 07:39.762
Don’t flatter yourself.

07:40.166 --> 07:42.140
Just back off Andy and Lucas.

07:42.217 --> 07:43.662
And leave my world alone.

07:49.635 --> 07:51.103
Isn’t that what this is really about?

07:51.858 --> 07:52.591
God!

08:10.465 --> 08:13.060
Next time... that’ll be your face!

08:21.305 --> 08:22.993
You guys ready for the summer?

08:26.568 --> 08:27.813
Yeah, me too.

08:27.998 --> 08:32.121
But, first, let’s give it up for the girl who made this happen tonight;

08:32.188 --> 08:34.710
my bestest friend: Peyton Sawyer.

08:38.645 --> 08:41.432
Peyton, Peyton, Peyton...

08:50.217 --> 08:51.071
Jake...

08:52.025 --> 08:53.880
You’ve been calling my attorneys a lot.

08:54.778 --> 08:55.851
I thought I could help.

08:56.065 --> 08:57.891
Well, you just pissed them off...

09:00.277 --> 09:01.262
at first.

09:02.646 --> 09:06.502
Then, you clearly weren’t going away, so they went over Nikki’s testimony line by line.

09:07.355 --> 09:08.660
And they found something.

09:09.797 --> 09:10.961
She lied, Peyton.

09:11.687 --> 09:14.690
She said that she’d been away at college but she wasn’t.

09:14.767 --> 09:16.220
She hadn’t been there in months.

09:16.397 --> 09:19.502
Well does, does that even matter, you know? Is that enough?

09:19.587 --> 09:21.770
Yeah, any lie is a lie under oath.

09:21.876 --> 09:24.133
Once my attorneys get a hold of her transcripts,

09:24.468 --> 09:26.070
the judge is gonna lift the court order;

09:26.144 --> 09:29.092
I’ll have sole custody of Jenny for a new hearing.

09:29.204 --> 09:31.470
And a chance to testify against all her other lies.

09:31.864 --> 09:34.971
That’s... that’s so great, Jake.

09:37.469 --> 09:38.683
When d’ya get out?

09:38.837 --> 09:40.191
A day or so, probably.

09:40.787 --> 09:42.732
And I’m gonna come find you as soon as I do.

09:43.856 --> 09:45.213
You did this, Peyton.

09:45.885 --> 09:49.203
You’ve given me hope; and I love you so much for it.

09:50.806 --> 09:52.911
Hey, hey, come on, don’t cry.

09:53.156 --> 09:55.423
Haven’t you ever cried when your happy?

10:08.217 --> 10:09.272
Come in, Nathan.

10:10.805 --> 10:11.982
How’d you know it was me?

10:12.296 --> 10:14.051
I can smell the confusion.

10:17.407 --> 10:19.200
That was a joke by the way.

10:20.797 --> 10:23.230
Nobody ever laughs at my jokes.

10:23.545 --> 10:24.912
That’s coz they’re not funny, Coach.

10:26.525 --> 10:29.243
Little bird told me you were moving back home.

10:29.607 --> 10:30.952
That little bird’s name Lucas?

10:32.955 --> 10:34.102
He cares about you.

10:35.976 --> 10:36.973
So do I.

10:38.776 --> 10:41.071
You’ve come quite a distance this year.

10:42.586 --> 10:45.463
I think moving out of that house has been good for you.

10:45.878 --> 10:46.600
Coach.

10:47.406 --> 10:48.162
Look at me.

10:48.985 --> 10:49.790
I’m a mess.

10:50.726 --> 10:52.802
Nah, you’re just a little bit broken.

10:53.635 --> 10:56.912
But it’s nothing that a summer at High Flyers couldn’t fix.

10:57.025 --> 10:59.041
- Could’ve fixed. 
- Still can.

10:59.486 --> 11:02.301
Dan Scott’s not the only one with pull in this town.

11:03.117 --> 11:07.520
The only thing that held you back as a player last season was heart...

11:08.218 --> 11:11.373
and I’ve watched that change over the past year.

11:12.338 --> 11:14.223
And I’ve been so proud of you.

11:17.487 --> 11:20.750
That camp has world class trainers.

11:21.468 --> 11:23.600
They can mend the physical part.

11:24.618 --> 11:26.882
I have a hunch, once that happens,

11:27.565 --> 11:29.371
the game will heal your heart.

11:31.115 --> 11:32.281
I dreamt about it;

11:32.956 --> 11:33.922
in the hospital...

11:34.515 --> 11:36.021
about going to that camp.

11:37.477 --> 11:38.362
I don’t know.

11:40.286 --> 11:41.803
My mom’s coming home soon.

11:42.876 --> 11:44.121
Gotta think about it.

11:48.065 --> 11:49.781
Promise me you’ll do that.

12:04.787 --> 12:07.900
How great is this? Dinner together, steaks on the grill.

12:07.976 --> 12:09.023
You not punching me.

12:12.007 --> 12:13.630
So I got some good news today.

12:13.737 --> 12:14.633
What’s that?

12:15.097 --> 12:17.171
Whitey thinks he can get me back into High Flyers.

12:19.197 --> 12:21.892
Well, as much as I love hearing you talk about basketball again,

12:22.495 --> 12:24.631
I really don’t think camp’s a smart play for you right now.

12:24.898 --> 12:27.413
- Dad, its High Flyers. 
- Exactly my point.

12:27.697 --> 12:30.553
You’re injured Nathan. You don’t want the scouts to see you like that.

12:30.708 --> 12:32.280
Plus, there’s your mother to consider.

12:34.228 --> 12:36.183
Listen, I don’t like to burden you with these things

12:36.237 --> 12:38.262
but you’re a man so I’m gonna be honest with you.

12:39.808 --> 12:42.833
Your mother’s pill addiction started when you moved out.

12:44.947 --> 12:47.040
Now, in no way does that mean you’re to blame, coz you’re not.

12:47.137 --> 12:50.601
But... she’s gonna be vulnerable when she comes home.

12:50.817 --> 12:52.700
And she’s gonna need you more than ever.

12:58.988 --> 13:03.062
Okay, guys, as student council president, I have one final duty

13:03.115 --> 13:04.842
before the summer begins and this is it.

13:04.925 --> 13:07.961
Tree Hill High, school is out and it is time to party!

13:08.068 --> 13:10.471
Please welcome Jimmy Eat World!

14:10.307 --> 14:11.312
So, it’s kinda weird;

14:11.856 --> 14:13.981
us... living under the same roof.

14:15.105 --> 14:16.230
Isn’t that weird.

14:17.238 --> 14:18.330
Yes it is.

14:18.755 --> 14:21.671
I mean, who would have thought this could have happened back when...

14:22.256 --> 14:23.271
we were together?

14:28.667 --> 14:30.610
You been talking to Peyton much?

14:31.075 --> 14:32.032
Little bit.

14:33.498 --> 14:35.532
I wish I was in her life more, you know?

14:38.635 --> 14:41.813
Guess I know what loss you’ll be writing about for your essay.

14:43.108 --> 14:45.071
I lost myself this year, Brooke.

14:46.276 --> 14:49.412
And what I did, I lost the people I truly care about.

14:51.328 --> 14:52.551
Oh, by the way, um...

14:53.766 --> 14:55.303
when we get to New York...

14:55.855 --> 14:58.650
I hope you’ll understand if we spend most of our time with Haley.

14:58.765 --> 15:02.730
It’s just... important that I focus on her today.

15:03.358 --> 15:04.090
You know?

15:04.767 --> 15:05.691
Of course.

15:07.577 --> 15:09.130
Everything else can wait.

16:29.088 --> 16:30.093
Lucas!

16:31.786 --> 16:34.023
Oh my gosh! Hi.

16:34.118 --> 16:38.190
Oh, well, it’s about time the tribal leaders came to collect their squaw.

16:38.308 --> 16:39.522
Oh, shut up, Chris.

16:39.886 --> 16:42.073
Yeah, shut up, Chris.

16:42.228 --> 16:43.330
Alright, I’m going.

16:45.727 --> 16:48.722
Oh... I see you couldn’t stay away from me.

16:48.836 --> 16:49.701
Out!

16:51.325 --> 16:54.453
I’m sorry. Oh, it’s good to see you too, Brooke.

16:55.297 --> 16:57.510
Yeah, you too, fugitive girl.

16:58.538 --> 17:00.002
Well, so what’re you guys doing here?

17:00.095 --> 17:01.753
We bought your English assignment.

17:01.836 --> 17:04.060
My- Oh my gosh, finals!

17:04.156 --> 17:06.422
Oh, god, that just feels like a totally different life.

17:07.396 --> 17:08.440
Let’s go, diva.

17:08.707 --> 17:11.873
Hey, Joey D, this is my friend Lucas and my friend Brooke.

17:11.954 --> 17:13.903
What’s up, guys? Ah, sorry I gotta drag her away

17:13.978 --> 17:16.512
but we’ve got three meetings and a satellite radio interview.

17:16.605 --> 17:17.902
- You ready? 
- Um...

17:19.326 --> 17:23.361
I’m just feeling a little... flu... ish.

17:23.675 --> 17:24.402
Haley...

17:24.517 --> 17:25.231
Yeah, I-

17:26.795 --> 17:28.550
It’s totally going around.

17:31.178 --> 17:32.222
Cover for me?

17:32.375 --> 17:34.752
Really, because I’m just, I’m sick as a dog here.

17:34.947 --> 17:37.193
No, no, wait Haley, no, no, wait... guys?

17:38.065 --> 17:39.141
I’m gonna be sick

17:39.506 --> 17:40.502
It’ll be okay.

17:40.796 --> 17:42.481
Dan can’t actually affect me legally.

17:42.626 --> 17:44.741
Yeah, but if you leave the country, then-

17:44.848 --> 17:48.843
Yes, it could create a bit of red tape that would hold up my return to the states.

17:52.405 --> 17:53.540
I’m gonna miss you.

17:55.115 --> 17:56.502
Unless you come with me.

17:58.466 --> 17:59.451
Bring Lucas.

18:00.117 --> 18:01.121
Take the summer...

18:02.567 --> 18:04.060
few years beyond that.

18:04.215 --> 18:06.272
Oh, Andy, I would love to.

18:06.376 --> 18:08.943
Honestly, there is nothing I would want more...

18:09.655 --> 18:10.542
but...

18:12.068 --> 18:15.682
with Deb’s troubles and the businesses and-

18:15.917 --> 18:16.701
Keith.

18:22.537 --> 18:24.542
Come on in! What do you think?

18:24.737 --> 18:27.220
No this is what I’m talking about.

18:27.427 --> 18:29.672
So... what-...

18:30.306 --> 18:31.651
what do you guys wanna do today?

18:31.757 --> 18:34.761
Wanna... take a limo to see the city? You wanna-

18:34.855 --> 18:36.831
I was thinking maybe we could just talk.

18:37.988 --> 18:38.910
Yeah.

18:40.477 --> 18:45.070
Um... I’m in New York city and my parents have resumed allowances;

18:45.157 --> 18:49.983
I would be crazy not to shop right now so I’m gonna leave you two alone. Okay?

18:50.448 --> 18:51.592
Good luck, see ya, bye.

19:01.166 --> 19:03.831
What you walked in on in the dressing room was innocent.

19:03.925 --> 19:04.581
Sure.

19:04.696 --> 19:07.431
It was, look, I’m not with Chris, okay?

19:08.268 --> 19:10.080
We were just kidding around like...

19:10.207 --> 19:11.720
We used to do?

19:15.458 --> 19:16.210
Yeah.

19:22.165 --> 19:23.212
I miss you so much.

19:31.965 --> 19:33.150
I’m sorry, Danny.

19:34.396 --> 19:36.120
Oh, this oughta be good.

19:36.478 --> 19:37.421
For what?

19:37.527 --> 19:39.541
Whatever you need me to be sorry for.

19:39.708 --> 19:42.082
Well, that’s a long list of screw-ups, Whitey.

19:42.307 --> 19:44.002
I take the blame for all of them...

19:44.338 --> 19:46.801
if it’ll help get Nathan into High Flyers.

19:47.208 --> 19:48.851
Ah, I see.

19:49.478 --> 19:51.260
You didn’t come here to apologise;

19:51.675 --> 19:53.231
you came to negotiate.

19:53.566 --> 19:55.530
I came to say I’m sorry.

19:56.226 --> 19:58.333
Dan, you were a great player...

19:58.915 --> 20:01.020
maybe I was a lousy coach...

20:01.557 --> 20:04.690
maybe I shoulda listened to you more and eased up a little bit.

20:05.227 --> 20:10.581
But... we can bury all that now and do what’s best for Nathan.

20:10.706 --> 20:12.900
And you think High Flyers is what’s good for him?

20:13.046 --> 20:15.383
I think... he needs to get away...

20:15.476 --> 20:18.441
and bathe himself in the game that you taught him to love.

20:19.348 --> 20:20.513
The game that...

20:21.156 --> 20:24.502
gave you all the hopes and dreams that it gave me.

20:25.788 --> 20:28.801
If saying ‘I’m sorry’ will help your son;

20:29.228 --> 20:32.743
a kid who, by the way, I think the world of...

20:33.767 --> 20:35.022
then I’m sorry.

20:35.508 --> 20:36.323
I was wrong.

20:37.518 --> 20:39.361
And I mean that sincerely.

20:42.946 --> 20:44.490
You know what, Whitey, you’re right.

20:46.706 --> 20:48.370
I was a great player...

20:50.137 --> 20:52.002
and you were a lousy coach.

20:52.985 --> 20:54.050
You still are.

21:03.488 --> 21:04.350
Erica.

21:04.566 --> 21:05.693
Come on, Mouth...

21:06.028 --> 21:07.891
give me some... mouth.

21:08.467 --> 21:10.061
You’re supposed to be helping me.

21:10.175 --> 21:13.552
Take it from someone who was obsessed with trying to be perfect:

21:13.958 --> 21:15.732
It’s not about perfect.

21:16.167 --> 21:19.093
It’s about living your life and doing the best you can.

21:21.535 --> 21:23.613
You’re pretty great, you know that?

21:23.737 --> 21:24.552
Yes.

21:25.457 --> 21:27.873
I’m so great... that I’ll make you a deal:

21:28.975 --> 21:31.011
for every sentence you write of your essay...

21:31.886 --> 21:33.402
I’ll give you a kiss.

21:35.096 --> 21:37.091
You think I could get an advance?

21:47.058 --> 21:48.531
Jake’s getting outta jail!

21:49.147 --> 21:51.340
Ah, that’s... that’s great, Peyton.

21:51.406 --> 21:54.250
He’s getting Jenny back, too, so I’m gonna go see him right now.

21:54.756 --> 21:55.753
Tell him I said ‘hey’.

21:59.416 --> 22:00.280
Hey, Nathan?

22:01.575 --> 22:03.131
I’m sorry I’m happy.

22:05.605 --> 22:07.311
Sometimes they come back, right?

22:14.408 --> 22:16.263
Jagielski, long window.

22:18.035 --> 22:19.461
Peyton, you don’t have to-

22:36.957 --> 22:37.900
Hi, Jake.

22:38.426 --> 22:39.972
How’s your sex life in there?

22:40.207 --> 22:41.381
What d’ya want, Nikki?

22:41.766 --> 22:43.403
I just came to say goodbye.

22:44.066 --> 22:45.812
You’re leaving before the hearing?

22:45.895 --> 22:48.521
Yeah... this game’s gotten old.

22:48.617 --> 22:50.152
Well, I guess it’s just as well.

22:50.605 --> 22:54.402
Once the judge hears my side of things, it’s not gonna matter if you’re there or not. You know it.

22:54.558 --> 22:56.251
Do you know how it feels, Jake?

22:56.576 --> 22:58.811
Knowing that you’ll never see your daughter again?

22:59.335 --> 23:01.410
Knowing that she’ll never be a part of your life?

23:02.307 --> 23:03.811
You’ll never see her walk...

23:04.425 --> 23:07.070
hear her laugh or watch her grow.

23:11.346 --> 23:12.470
Goodbye, Nikki.

23:13.818 --> 23:14.871
Goodbye, Jake.

23:17.256 --> 23:18.520
Oh, one more thing.

23:19.016 --> 23:19.782
Yeah.

23:19.876 --> 23:21.993
The next time you wanna hide my daughter...

23:22.325 --> 23:24.331
you’ve gotta do better that Florida.

23:35.987 --> 23:37.781
Do you know how it feels, Jake?

23:38.088 --> 23:40.032
Never to see your daughter again?

23:40.237 --> 23:41.482
Because you will.

23:41.646 --> 23:42.462
Nikki!

23:42.658 --> 23:44.531
Say goodbye to daddy, bunny.

23:45.435 --> 23:46.461
Forever.

23:47.447 --> 23:48.232
Nikki!

23:52.046 --> 23:52.892
Guard!

23:53.336 --> 23:54.023
Nikki!

23:54.257 --> 23:57.281
Somebody stop her! She’s got my baby! Nikki, come on!

23:57.518 --> 23:58.381
Nikki!

23:59.465 --> 24:00.432
Nikki!

24:04.157 --> 24:05.601
I’m guessing you’re here because of Nathan.

24:07.296 --> 24:08.380
Kind of.

24:09.207 --> 24:12.302
You know that he told me not to come home, right? You know that?

24:14.497 --> 24:18.233
Look, mostly, I’m here because of us, Haley.

24:19.837 --> 24:23.232
You know, I was... sitting in class... and...

24:24.186 --> 24:26.392
I looked over and saw your empty seat...

24:26.528 --> 24:27.761
and it struck me;

24:28.196 --> 24:30.163
that not too long ago, it was just you and me.

24:30.695 --> 24:31.520
Yeah.

24:33.255 --> 24:36.053
Suddenly, it felt wrong; that you weren’t there.

24:38.288 --> 24:39.943
You think I was wrong for leaving.

24:45.745 --> 24:46.912
Here’s what I think:

24:47.396 --> 24:49.841
you stood by me when I left the Rivercourt

24:51.217 --> 24:54.723
because a voice in my head told me that it’s what I had to do.

24:56.727 --> 24:58.222
So I’m here for you, Hales.

24:59.036 --> 25:00.512
And I always will be.

25:02.317 --> 25:05.152
Even... when I don’t understand it.

25:06.366 --> 25:07.261
Thanks, Luke.

25:09.457 --> 25:10.291
Thank you.

25:12.485 --> 25:13.412
Because...

25:14.698 --> 25:16.761
sometimes I don’t understand it either.

25:17.988 --> 25:20.011
Um, oh my god, Haley James?

25:20.246 --> 25:22.923
We just saw you play last night, could we get an autograph.

25:23.388 --> 25:24.182
Um...

25:25.558 --> 25:26.541
yeah, sure.

25:26.606 --> 25:27.461
Oh, thanks.

25:28.947 --> 25:30.553
- What’s your name? 
- Jennifer.

25:40.006 --> 25:42.631
Lucas and Haley aren’t back yet!

25:42.965 --> 25:45.372
But you can come in to the Devil’s lair.

25:45.535 --> 25:46.853
Drop your things...

25:47.158 --> 25:49.121
have sex with Chris Keller!

25:49.565 --> 25:50.581
Whatever.

25:52.117 --> 25:56.460
Here’s the deal: Brooke Davis thinks Chris Keller can self-serve Chris Keller;

25:56.556 --> 25:58.122
in other words, you can go-

25:58.236 --> 25:59.542
Oh hey, Brooke.

26:00.546 --> 26:01.813
What’s going on?

26:01.957 --> 26:03.601
She was just hitting on me.

26:05.128 --> 26:06.791
Hey, we missed you at the on-air.

26:07.138 --> 26:08.711
How’s the flu bug?

26:08.798 --> 26:11.723
Oh... it’ll pass, thanks. How’d it go?

26:11.825 --> 26:14.162
Well, without you, there’s more time to talk about me.

26:14.366 --> 26:15.462
It went great!

26:18.956 --> 26:19.680
What?

26:19.946 --> 26:24.541
I can’t breathe... there’s no room with Chris’ ego! Can we go?!

26:24.626 --> 26:26.671
Yes, let’s go. You can show me what you got.

26:26.777 --> 26:28.432
Hey, you can show me what you got, too.

26:30.257 --> 26:31.891
Lucas, it was good seeing you, buddy.

26:37.607 --> 26:40.123
Wow, yo-you angry or you just hitting on me?

26:40.225 --> 26:42.282
You ever tried singing with you jaw wired shut?

26:42.378 --> 26:43.511
I guess you’re angry.

26:43.646 --> 26:44.942
Do you think this is a joke?

26:45.548 --> 26:46.681
Because it’s not!

26:47.005 --> 26:49.440
You’re messing with people’s lives; people I care about!

26:49.528 --> 26:50.482
Messing how?

26:51.126 --> 26:52.553
You mean having sex with Haley?

26:55.247 --> 26:56.573
Coz I never did that.

26:57.285 --> 26:58.080
Okay?

26:58.426 --> 26:59.880
Is that what you needed to hear?

27:02.436 --> 27:03.863
How’s Nathan doing, anyway?

27:04.838 --> 27:05.830
Don’t go there.

27:06.368 --> 27:08.690
Oh, come on, man, you don’t think I think about the guy?

27:08.946 --> 27:10.721
I’m a song writer; I carry all that crap around.

27:10.806 --> 27:12.362
Well, then you should know how he's doing!

27:13.056 --> 27:14.202
He's terrible!

27:14.346 --> 27:15.243
Well, he should be.

27:15.435 --> 27:17.510
Haley’s a great girl. It would suck to lose her.

27:17.618 --> 27:19.922
And you don't feel the slightest bit guilty about that?!

27:20.028 --> 27:21.392
No, and I’ll tell you why:

27:21.546 --> 27:23.580
this is a one in a million chance we’re taking here.

27:23.665 --> 27:27.281
You gotta be selfish as hell; you’re either all in... or you’re out.

27:27.875 --> 27:29.452
You don’t think I’ve tried to talk to her about it?

27:29.526 --> 27:31.530
In the middle of the night on some random bus ride?

27:31.648 --> 27:34.553
Hell, man, I’ve talked to her a lot more than you have these past few months.

27:39.458 --> 27:42.123
Listen, Luke, I know she’s your friend, so...

27:42.218 --> 27:44.402
you can hate me for helping her chase her dream, but...

27:45.698 --> 27:48.191
I’m just trying to help her, now. You know?

27:48.967 --> 27:50.312
That same way you are.

27:51.105 --> 27:52.623
The rest, it’s up to her.

27:59.706 --> 28:02.043
Hey. Tell Brooke I said ‘hi’.

28:11.436 --> 28:12.733
You don’t lock your door at night.

28:14.227 --> 28:15.562
No one can hurt me.

28:15.788 --> 28:16.992
Nah, that’s where you’re mistaken.

28:19.206 --> 28:20.772
- Is that right? 
- That’s right.

28:21.255 --> 28:25.271
You see, I know about your little tax evasion scam...

28:25.358 --> 28:28.212
and more than that...I have proof of it.

28:30.155 --> 28:32.633
You know, I don’t have any idea what you’re talking about.

28:32.757 --> 28:33.662
Really?

28:35.035 --> 28:38.183
I see you’ve got a... new security system installed.

28:38.865 --> 28:39.811
Who installed it?

28:41.508 --> 28:43.521
Gotta diversify your portfolio, Dan.

28:44.125 --> 28:46.200
Security’s good business; I should know.

28:47.125 --> 28:49.822
I own the company that put your system in.

28:52.598 --> 28:53.722
I have your ledger.

28:54.616 --> 28:55.573
You’re bluffing.

28:56.097 --> 28:57.741
Well, we’ll see about that.

29:11.936 --> 29:15.612
You know, leave all this. I plan to redecorate when I buy this place, anyway.

29:45.006 --> 29:48.121
Oh yeah, sorry about today with the fans, earlier.

29:48.415 --> 29:51.283
- We were talking and, I just, I’m sorry- 
- It’s okay.

29:52.068 --> 29:55.973
It’s okay; actually, it was kinda cool to... see how far you’ve come.

29:56.578 --> 29:58.433
You know, I’m proud of you.

29:59.907 --> 30:00.741
But?

30:01.836 --> 30:03.372
It’s killing him, Haley.

30:05.195 --> 30:09.813
I guess I just don’t understand why it has to be one or the other: music or Nathan.

30:12.656 --> 30:15.682
I noticed you weren’t... wearing your wedding ring.

30:20.835 --> 30:22.702
It’s not because of the record label.

30:24.228 --> 30:26.380
And it’s not because I don’t love him.

30:28.276 --> 30:29.330
I just...

30:31.928 --> 30:33.842
I feel like I don’t deserve to.

30:37.176 --> 30:40.030
Things were so much simpler when it was just the two of us.

30:46.716 --> 30:47.923
But it’s not.

30:58.637 --> 30:59.781
- Hey. 
- Hey!

31:00.207 --> 31:01.340
How’d your essay go?

31:02.208 --> 31:03.703
I did the best I could.

31:48.506 --> 31:49.781
Nice try, Hargrove.

32:43.738 --> 32:47.390
Lucas... we’ve got to get out of town before I spot another sale.

32:48.547 --> 32:50.932
I’m gonna go find somebody to carry these.

32:57.008 --> 32:58.242
Here, um...

32:58.848 --> 32:59.991
it’s my English final.

33:01.197 --> 33:02.411
Pulled an all-nighter.

33:02.758 --> 33:05.773
Aren’t you... supposed to be trashing hotel rooms or something?

33:06.225 --> 33:10.881
You know, what kind of a rock star spends the entire night doing an English final?

33:10.986 --> 33:13.440
Well... I am still Tutor Girl.

33:13.697 --> 33:14.502
Right?

33:15.176 --> 33:16.181
Besides, it was...

33:17.158 --> 33:18.963
it was a pretty easy topic for me.

33:20.788 --> 33:21.900
So...

33:23.798 --> 33:26.232
maybe this means you’re coming back soon?

33:28.196 --> 33:28.951
No.

33:31.276 --> 33:32.972
I’m not coming home, Lucas.

33:35.648 --> 33:37.162
This is my life, now.

33:39.646 --> 33:41.113
Oh, um...

33:48.505 --> 33:51.083
I need you to... give this to Nathan for me, please.

33:52.808 --> 33:53.993
Please, Luke.

34:07.897 --> 34:10.003
So I guess this is goodbye?

34:11.206 --> 34:12.431
Yeah, I guess so.

34:18.975 --> 34:23.262
I... will always be there for you, Haley.

34:24.775 --> 34:26.960
You’ll always be my best friend.

34:39.928 --> 34:40.721
Hey.

34:41.906 --> 34:42.860
Come here.

34:44.018 --> 34:45.532
It’s all gonna be okay now.

34:45.657 --> 34:46.601
Peyton...

34:48.568 --> 34:51.072
- I have to go. 
- What? No, don’t.

34:51.627 --> 34:53.570
- Stay here. 
- Nikki found Jenny.

34:54.195 --> 34:55.103
What d’ya mean?

34:55.876 --> 34:57.503
She has her, Peyton.

34:57.686 --> 34:59.770
What? How?

34:59.968 --> 35:03.673
I don’t know how, okay? But I have to go, I have to find her.

35:03.765 --> 35:04.630
I’ll go with you!

35:04.787 --> 35:06.162
- No, you can’t. 
- But...

35:06.237 --> 35:07.043
Peyton.

35:08.618 --> 35:09.612
You can’t.

35:12.708 --> 35:13.990
Why not?

35:15.638 --> 35:21.342
I mean, what’s the point of school and grades and all of this if I’m not...

35:22.667 --> 35:26.092
God Jake, I can’t be without you, I love you!

35:30.086 --> 35:31.141
You’re meant for better.

35:31.208 --> 35:32.510
- I’m not! 
- You are.

35:33.198 --> 35:36.750
Hey, look, I don’t know, maybe I’ll find Jenny sooner than later. Maybe I’ll be back-

35:36.825 --> 35:38.972
You won't! You know you won’t!

35:40.708 --> 35:41.630
Come here.

35:44.576 --> 35:45.570
Listen to me.

35:47.137 --> 35:48.251
I need you...

35:49.797 --> 35:51.391
- to get past this. 
- No!

35:51.478 --> 35:54.233
I need you to forget about me and move on.

35:55.227 --> 35:56.002
Okay?

35:57.397 --> 35:59.441
You’re too amazing to carry this around.

35:59.875 --> 36:01.800
You’re too full of greatness and...

36:05.107 --> 36:06.702
I love you too much.

36:13.178 --> 36:14.102
But I have to go.

36:14.216 --> 36:15.010
No!

36:17.278 --> 36:19.140
You know, I can’t have Jenny be with Nikki.

36:34.228 --> 36:35.172
Jake!

36:41.546 --> 36:42.552
Thank you.

36:45.646 --> 36:47.860
You know, I coulda held you in my arms forever.

36:50.597 --> 36:52.712
It still wouldn’t have been long enough.

38:04.866 --> 38:06.633
You miss Haley, don’t you?

38:10.548 --> 38:11.792
You gonna be alright?

38:14.548 --> 38:16.852
Yeah, it’s just hard to let someone go, you know?

38:21.406 --> 38:23.291
It’s okay that you’re into Peyton.

38:25.728 --> 38:29.470
I’ve been avoiding it the whole trip, but I found the things in your closet;

38:29.778 --> 38:30.723
and its fine.

39:04.508 --> 39:06.611
I just wanted to say goodbye before I left.

39:06.938 --> 39:09.341
You’re leaving now? Tonight?

39:10.167 --> 39:11.401
I think it’s best.

39:12.376 --> 39:13.300
For mum...

39:14.748 --> 39:15.751
and for you.

39:22.518 --> 39:24.090
Andy...

39:29.816 --> 39:32.713
Oh, and... I need you to give this to Lucas.

39:33.638 --> 39:34.413
Of course.

39:46.908 --> 39:47.713
Andy.

39:51.367 --> 39:52.732
I love you, you know?

39:56.357 --> 39:57.481
I do.

39:58.116 --> 39:59.341
And I love you, Karen.

40:03.398 --> 40:06.053
But, somehow, it just... doesn’t seem to be enough.

40:25.407 --> 40:27.573
George Bernard Shaw once wrote:

40:28.136 --> 40:30.122
‘There are two tragedies in life:

40:30.708 --> 40:32.781
one is to lose your heart’s desire...

40:33.718 --> 40:35.543
the other is to gain it’.

40:36.797 --> 40:39.600
Clearly, Shaw had his heart broken once or twice.

40:54.318 --> 40:55.320
Where you been?

40:56.335 --> 40:57.453
Went to see a friend.

40:57.795 --> 40:59.921
Yeah? Anyone I know?

41:03.977 --> 41:04.980
Not really.

41:07.397 --> 41:08.831
You know you’re bleeding?

41:09.445 --> 41:10.683
Yeah.

41:12.028 --> 41:13.473
It should probably hurt, but...

41:14.095 --> 41:16.463
it’s kinda weird; I don’t feel anything.

41:19.445 --> 41:21.582
As far as I’m concerned, Shaw was a punk.

41:22.076 --> 41:24.572
Coz you know what? Tragedies happen.

41:25.587 --> 41:28.813
What’re you gonna do, give up? Quit? No.

41:30.196 --> 41:35.042
I realise now that when your heart breaks, you gotta fight like hell to make sure you’re still alive.

41:36.335 --> 41:37.341
Coz you are,

41:37.737 --> 41:39.012
and that pain you feel...

41:39.645 --> 41:40.651
it’s life.

41:41.177 --> 41:42.672
The confusion and fear...

41:43.487 --> 41:46.621
that’s there to remind you that somewhere out there is something better.

41:47.735 --> 41:49.862
And that something is worth fighting for.

42:01.508 --> 42:05.000
This year, I got everything I wanted and everything I wished for...

42:05.637 --> 42:09.350
but, in a way, I lost even more.

42:09.615 --> 42:11.841
Haley, the new tour posters are here.

42:14.068 --> 42:14.853
What’s this?

42:15.138 --> 42:19.322
Um... nothing, you know, just... stupid kid stuff.

42:21.715 --> 42:22.521
What d’ya think?

42:22.715 --> 42:23.553
Wow!

42:30.147 --> 42:31.392
Shaw was right:

42:31.898 --> 42:34.552
as we strain to grasp the things we desire...

42:34.676 --> 42:37.150
the things we think will make our lives better...

42:37.447 --> 42:40.403
money, popularity, fame...

42:40.698 --> 42:42.713
we ignore what truly matters...

42:42.828 --> 42:49.061
the simple things: like friendship, family, love.

42:50.198 --> 42:52.611
The things we probably already had.

42:54.587 --> 42:58.160
So, Mr. Shaw thinks that getting your hearts desire is a tragedy?

42:59.436 --> 43:00.920
I say he’s wrong.

43:01.458 --> 43:05.040
I mean, clearly, Shaw never kissed Erica Marsh.

43:27.046 --> 43:29.781
Yes, losing your heart’s desire is tragic.

43:31.378 --> 43:33.100
But gaining your heart’s desire...

43:34.468 --> 43:35.860
it’s all you can hope for.

43:38.998 --> 43:40.970
This year, I wished for love.

43:42.975 --> 43:47.203
To immerse myself in someone else and to wake a heart long afraid to feel.

43:51.995 --> 43:53.592
My wish was granted.

43:56.567 --> 44:00.060
And if having that is tragic... then give me tragedy.

44:06.368 --> 44:08.941
Because, I wouldn’t give it back for the world.

44:42.116 --> 44:42.951
Hey.

44:45.467 --> 44:46.313
Need some help?

44:46.618 --> 44:47.291
Nah.

44:47.715 --> 44:51.373
I figure if I leave all my stuff here, my parents are gonna have to let me come back for senior year.

44:53.675 --> 44:56.252
Look, are we ever… gonna talk about Peyton?

44:56.846 --> 44:58.121
And the stuff you found?

44:58.548 --> 45:02.640
It’s not a big deal. Actually, I was… kinda relieved.

45:04.435 --> 45:05.480
Relieved?

45:05.815 --> 45:07.291
I thought you might be into me.

45:07.737 --> 45:12.651
And… that would’ve ruined everything because we’ve become friends…

45:12.737 --> 45:14.371
and that’s exactly what I needed.

45:14.735 --> 45:16.913
And… it’s exactly what I want.

45:18.256 --> 45:22.611
But you seemed… upset… that I held onto all that stuff; you still do.

45:24.048 --> 45:26.320
Finding that stuff was kind of like…

45:27.618 --> 45:28.621
evidence.

45:29.537 --> 45:32.690
Reminded me of what happened… and how it happened.

45:34.498 --> 45:36.720
And I guess my heart just wasn’t ready for that.

45:49.765 --> 45:51.423
How you feeling, Ms. Scott?

45:52.077 --> 45:54.490
Coach! How you doing?

45:55.556 --> 45:57.602
Well, I guess you’re waiting for Danny.

45:57.776 --> 46:00.323
Uh, yeah, yeah, he… planned to pick me up.

46:00.745 --> 46:02.760
I was… hoping he’d bring Nathan.

46:03.957 --> 46:05.231
I lied.

46:05.756 --> 46:08.832
I had one of the girls at the office put you back an hour.

46:09.307 --> 46:12.152
I thought you and I might… have a talk.

46:17.847 --> 46:19.632
Any chance you could tap that thing?

46:20.228 --> 46:21.753
Sorry, we’re closed.

46:22.536 --> 46:25.640
Well, I hope so because if this is open, you’ve got problems.

46:26.168 --> 46:27.381
Where’re you taking this?

46:27.915 --> 46:29.891
- Over there, but… 
- I got it.

46:30.387 --> 46:31.872
Uh… thanks.

46:31.957 --> 46:33.052
No problem.

46:33.608 --> 46:35.702
If I had a dollar for every keg I’ve carried,

46:36.248 --> 46:37.720
I’d be a rich girl.

46:38.497 --> 46:39.680
Bartender?

46:40.028 --> 46:42.703
Only when I’m not killing people or saving the world.

46:43.297 --> 46:46.641
Well, if you’re looking for a job, I can put in a good word with the owner.

46:46.766 --> 46:48.860
Actually, I’m looking for Peyton.

46:49.468 --> 46:50.612
Oh, um…

46:50.887 --> 46:52.042
I’m Peyton.

46:53.368 --> 46:56.172
Oh. I’m Ellie.

46:56.377 --> 46:58.960
I write a column for Alternative Press. You know it?

46:59.776 --> 47:01.841
Know it? I read it cover to cover.

47:02.047 --> 47:03.080
Which column?

47:03.448 --> 47:04.953
Actually, it’s a new one.

47:05.148 --> 47:09.650
But I heard some high school girl got The Wreckers and Jimmy Eat World to play her club night.

47:09.915 --> 47:12.173
And I wanted to know more. Whaddaya say?

47:12.607 --> 47:16.833
I’d say I’m really flattered, but… I think last night was my final show.

47:17.967 --> 47:20.220
Well, I assume there’s a reason for that?

47:21.578 --> 47:22.391
Yeah.

47:22.747 --> 47:24.941
Sounds like the makings of a great story.

47:25.728 --> 47:26.971
No thanks.

47:27.206 --> 47:28.992
But it was really nice to meet you.

47:30.007 --> 47:32.170
It’s nice to meet you too, Peyton.

47:48.458 --> 47:51.993
Luke, find the combination and Dan is… finished.

48:38.575 --> 48:39.321
Hey.

48:40.845 --> 48:41.723
What’s up?

48:42.468 --> 48:43.411
Nothing, you?

48:44.876 --> 48:46.680
I thought you said you were done spying on him.

48:47.685 --> 48:48.813
I am.

48:49.636 --> 48:50.713
Then what’s in the bag?

48:56.026 --> 48:58.460
Just… bringing this back to you.

48:59.546 --> 49:01.022
You gave me your word, Luke.

49:01.798 --> 49:04.211
I know, and I’m done.

49:05.876 --> 49:06.812
I promise.

49:26.068 --> 49:27.530
Giving up on your dreams?

49:28.738 --> 49:29.503
Mom.

49:29.655 --> 49:31.022
Oh, my boy.

49:32.306 --> 49:34.340
I have missed you.

49:35.848 --> 49:37.440
It’s gonna be okay now, mom.

49:37.705 --> 49:38.531
Yeah.

49:39.966 --> 49:41.930
So, what’s all this about?

49:43.025 --> 49:44.652
Nathan’s moving home, Deb.

49:48.836 --> 49:50.333
We’re gonna be a family again.

49:53.687 --> 49:54.842
Welcome home.

50:28.418 --> 50:30.301
- Hi-O! 
- Oh God!

50:31.586 --> 50:32.441
What?

50:33.387 --> 50:34.830
You scared the hell outta me.

50:35.818 --> 50:38.712
You don’t know anybody who has IM named ‘WATCHMEWATCHU’, do you?

50:38.827 --> 50:42.350
Hmm... sounds pervy. Sadly no, why?

50:43.135 --> 50:45.483
Doesn’t matter. Sup?

50:45.588 --> 50:47.383
It’s actually what I came to ask you.

50:47.536 --> 50:51.753
Couldn’t find you at the club last night; figured maybe you stayed in with Jake.

50:51.828 --> 50:53.523
Jake’s gone, Brooke.

50:55.445 --> 50:56.862
Nikki has Jenny.

50:57.737 --> 51:00.363
Oh, Peyton, come here. What happened?

51:02.707 --> 51:07.451
I can’t, coz if you hug me, then I’m gonna start… bawling again, so…

51:09.058 --> 51:10.872
some summer break, huh?

51:12.998 --> 51:15.381
Well… I mean, he’s coming back, right?

51:15.488 --> 51:18.952
He’ll… find Jenny and then he can slap Nikki

51:19.038 --> 51:22.271
and then he’s coming right back to you! I just know it.

51:22.647 --> 51:23.582
Thanks.

51:25.188 --> 51:28.101
Okay, I’m sorry, I’m changing the subject;

51:28.175 --> 51:31.422
how was your road trip with Lucas.

51:31.527 --> 51:34.281
Um… fine.

51:34.416 --> 51:37.263
Fine? Is this gonna get sexual?

51:38.595 --> 51:40.653
I don’t know, that’s kind of up to you.

51:40.848 --> 51:41.593
What?

51:42.576 --> 51:45.393
It can wait. You’re head is spinning.

51:46.496 --> 51:50.121
Brooke, considering you’re leaving, tomorrow, it can’t wait.

51:50.725 --> 51:51.643
Spill!

51:52.116 --> 51:53.013
Okay.

51:54.717 --> 51:58.310
Um… I was snooping through Lucas’ things; kind of on purpose,

51:58.355 --> 52:01.443
and found a bunch of your stuff that he saved and I think he’s still into you.

52:03.807 --> 52:08.663
Like I said: bad timing… seeing that Jake just left, or maybe good timing?

52:10.096 --> 52:13.163
Brooke, I’m sorry.

52:13.495 --> 52:15.652
I know you have feelings for Lucas.

52:16.348 --> 52:17.863
Phantom feelings.

52:17.996 --> 52:20.980
Like… when you lose a leg and try to scratch it.

52:21.438 --> 52:25.653
Lucas was my… gangrene infected, amputated limb.

52:25.977 --> 52:26.872
Really?

52:28.586 --> 52:31.411
I was so insecure when I was with him, Peyton…

52:31.607 --> 52:35.632
and this whole thing just reminded me that I don’t wanna be that girl again.

52:36.378 --> 52:37.402
I won’t be.

52:40.557 --> 52:43.443
Marcus, I don’t understand, he was supposed to be there by now.

52:44.425 --> 52:47.673
Well… can you leave him another message in case he checks in?

52:48.017 --> 52:49.171
Andy Hargrove.

52:49.778 --> 52:50.612
Thanks.

53:08.717 --> 53:09.581
Karen?

53:10.368 --> 53:11.872
Oh my gosh, Deb!

53:13.145 --> 53:14.213
Welcome back!

53:15.078 --> 53:17.102
You look like you just saw a ghost.

53:17.507 --> 53:18.892
Well, I think I did.

53:19.508 --> 53:20.602
How you feeling?

53:20.695 --> 53:25.250
Uh, good. Great actually. I just… I need to keep busy.

53:25.355 --> 53:28.353
Are you sure? I mean… you don’t wanna take some time?

53:28.437 --> 53:30.063
Uh, no, no, absolutely not.

53:30.145 --> 53:32.200
Well, okay. Let’s talk.

53:32.277 --> 53:33.132
Okay.

53:40.837 --> 53:42.702
You’re not going away, are you?

53:44.166 --> 53:45.331
Not this time.

53:46.656 --> 53:48.011
That’s a rad jacket.

53:48.385 --> 53:49.290
Thanks.

53:49.796 --> 53:51.553
I stole it from Courtney Love.

53:51.848 --> 53:52.551
Really?

53:52.647 --> 53:55.030
Yeah. She was being a bitch.

53:55.145 --> 53:56.171
So I took it.

53:57.487 --> 53:58.401
Have a seat.

53:59.558 --> 54:05.370
So, the editors at THUD are thrilled about your story and they say I have to talk to you.

54:06.178 --> 54:07.552
Is it that bad?

54:07.785 --> 54:11.253
Well, if there’s no House of Freaks at TRIC, there’s no story.

54:12.475 --> 54:15.480
And what about the rest of your life? Is it that bad?

54:17.206 --> 54:18.650
What do you know about it?

54:20.007 --> 54:25.570
Well… your eyes are puffy which, from experience, screams textbook crying eyes.

54:25.665 --> 54:30.181
You have your hair up so you’re probably not planning on impressing any boys today.

54:30.245 --> 54:35.202
I’d say you’re nursing a hell of a broken heart; and not the school-girl crush kind, the real thing.

54:38.017 --> 54:40.352
Um… okay.

54:40.437 --> 54:44.763
Uh… well, I mean, I started TRIC to escape it all, you know, and…

54:44.858 --> 54:48.253
bring people together; let the music drown out the white noise in life.

54:48.348 --> 54:49.942
And tell me about your life.

54:50.138 --> 54:51.963
What is the white noise made of?

54:52.047 --> 54:55.181
Oh, god, I mean… everything unnecessary…

54:55.267 --> 55:00.622
like… cliques and… greed and popularity and harassment-

55:00.707 --> 55:02.331
The song remains the same.

55:02.418 --> 55:04.133
Yeah, as far as I can tell, it does.

55:10.058 --> 55:11.783
Looks like we’re both getting better.

55:12.796 --> 55:14.513
You love this game, don’t you?

55:15.505 --> 55:17.103
Depends on what day you ask me.

55:17.525 --> 55:20.330
Nah, you loved it every day since you could hold a ball.

55:21.558 --> 55:23.961
So… why aren’t you going to the camp?

55:24.927 --> 55:26.141
You talk to dad?

55:26.586 --> 55:27.710
Talked to Whitey.

55:28.265 --> 55:30.672
He said you’re staying because of me.

55:31.096 --> 55:32.890
Whitey also drinks a lot, mom.

55:34.636 --> 55:35.652
Then you’ll go.

55:38.088 --> 55:39.160
Look, uh…

55:40.875 --> 55:42.583
dad told me about the pills;

55:42.925 --> 55:44.860
about how you started taking them because…

55:44.935 --> 55:46.131
Because what?

55:46.937 --> 55:48.113
Because I moved out.

55:48.206 --> 55:49.882
Is that what he told you?

55:50.568 --> 55:53.230
I took the pills because you moved away?

55:53.777 --> 55:54.662
Yeah.

55:56.165 --> 55:57.700
That son of a bitch!

55:58.458 --> 55:59.913
Nathan, listen to me;

56:00.376 --> 56:03.860
you misunderstood me when I said that I wanted us to be a family again.

56:03.955 --> 56:08.761
I want us to be a family again; you and me.

56:09.975 --> 56:11.450
Will you come with me?

56:12.797 --> 56:13.712
Yeah.

56:15.348 --> 56:17.262
But what’re we gonna do about dad?

56:17.746 --> 56:19.501
Huh, he won’t just let us go.

56:19.618 --> 56:22.143
We’re getting out, Nathan, together.

56:22.965 --> 56:25.343
Your father can burn in hell for all I care.

56:50.627 --> 56:52.482
Where is the combination?

57:21.026 --> 57:21.772
Damn!

57:52.606 --> 57:53.880
Game over.

58:02.515 --> 58:03.283
Brooke?

58:03.536 --> 58:09.091
Um… I found it while I was packing. Just… kind of felt like I should try it on.

58:11.008 --> 58:11.913
Can we talk?

58:12.417 --> 58:13.232
Yeah.

58:23.597 --> 58:27.291
I can’t let you leave tomorrow without saying this.

58:28.625 --> 58:31.423
Lucas, if this is about Peyton, I don’t-

58:31.598 --> 58:34.303
I love you, Brooke.

58:35.186 --> 58:37.721
And, I know: just friends, but…

58:38.567 --> 58:41.050
I need you to know how I feel.

58:45.375 --> 58:47.072
I can’t believe I’m hearing this.

58:47.498 --> 58:48.820
Brooke, don’t go.

58:49.075 --> 58:53.151
I can’t believe… you would walk into my bedroom -

58:53.508 --> 58:56.110
formally your bedroom; but that’s besides the point -

58:56.407 --> 59:01.042
and knowing our history… blurt out that you love me.

59:05.148 --> 59:06.731
Coz I was hoping you would.

59:16.206 --> 59:16.972
Brooke?

59:17.936 --> 59:19.440
It took you long enough.

59:40.495 --> 59:42.200
This has gotta be a dream.

01:00:00.395 --> 01:00:02.523
Lucas! Do not make me join you!

01:00:02.668 --> 01:00:04.420
Uh… a little privacy here.

01:00:04.526 --> 01:00:08.531
No, you have been in the shower forever. By the time I even get in, the water is gonna be...

01:00:08.795 --> 01:00:11.800
...cold! Are you taking a cold shower!?

01:00:11.886 --> 01:00:14.850
- No, the hot water just- 
- Gross! You are.

01:00:14.937 --> 01:00:17.772
You know what, next wet dream, tell Peyton I said ‘hi’.

01:00:17.897 --> 01:00:18.693
Eww!

01:00:22.916 --> 01:00:25.441
Mom, can we get a lock on the bathroom door?

01:00:26.708 --> 01:00:27.743
Going somewhere?

01:00:29.266 --> 01:00:30.553
Like New Zealand?

01:00:32.007 --> 01:00:33.570
You know, Keith was right.

01:00:35.535 --> 01:00:39.703
He once told me that I… I hide my heart and I run from love.

01:00:41.198 --> 01:00:42.651
I did that with Andy.

01:00:44.615 --> 01:00:48.842
I’m just being dumb; we don’t even have money for two plane tickets to New Zealand, right?

01:00:51.045 --> 01:00:52.503
We have enough for one.

01:00:54.317 --> 01:00:56.950
Look… mom, I love you…

01:00:57.207 --> 01:01:00.990
but… I’m a big boy now and I’ll be fine on my own.

01:01:04.327 --> 01:01:05.810
It’s your journey to take.

01:01:13.566 --> 01:01:16.852
If I thought he was coming back soon, I wouldn’t even consider it.

01:01:16.997 --> 01:01:18.590
- I know. 
- But you’re…

01:01:20.857 --> 01:01:24.872
Dan… is pulling the strings as usual.

01:01:29.335 --> 01:01:30.521
Not for long.

01:01:38.456 --> 01:01:39.522
Let me ask you something:

01:01:39.607 --> 01:01:42.301
are you not helping me move you because it brings back bad memories

01:01:42.355 --> 01:01:44.381
or because you’re a lazy pile of crap?

01:01:44.985 --> 01:01:47.512
You mean… bad memories like these?

01:01:51.175 --> 01:01:52.241
Oh god.

01:01:52.666 --> 01:01:54.192
We started off the school year this way.

01:01:54.277 --> 01:01:55.570
Yeah, don’t remind me.

01:01:55.926 --> 01:01:58.063
- You were never happier. 
- You were never hornier!

01:01:58.157 --> 01:01:59.643
Oh yeah? You want some more of that magic?

01:01:59.726 --> 01:02:00.403
- Don’t- 
- Come here.

01:02:00.475 --> 01:02:01.171
- No- 
- Come on.

01:02:01.246 --> 01:02:02.923
Okay, stop it! Ah!

01:02:04.336 --> 01:02:04.790
Come on.

01:02:04.897 --> 01:02:07.012
- Will you stop! 
- Well, well!

01:02:07.157 --> 01:02:09.721
First Lucas, then Jake, now Nathan.

01:02:09.845 --> 01:02:11.452
I guess slutty’s in season!

01:02:11.807 --> 01:02:13.773
And why is bitch being a Brooke?

01:02:13.866 --> 01:02:16.522
I don’t know, maybe because I’m leaving for the summer;

01:02:16.597 --> 01:02:20.682
possibly forever and my best friend is off… giving interviews and

01:02:20.766 --> 01:02:25.291
having… pseudo-innocent foreplay with kinda married guys.

01:02:26.578 --> 01:02:27.473
Okay.

01:02:29.867 --> 01:02:31.461
Hi, Alternative Press?

01:02:31.577 --> 01:02:32.760
Editorial please.

01:02:33.216 --> 01:02:34.382
What’re you doing?

01:02:34.747 --> 01:02:37.980
I know that you are needy right now and so I’m postponing the interview

01:02:38.057 --> 01:02:40.361
until after my best friend is gone for the summer.

01:02:42.366 --> 01:02:44.232
Hi, Ellie Harp, please.

01:02:45.147 --> 01:02:47.850
Oh, okay, um… maybe I have the name wrong.

01:02:47.957 --> 01:02:51.052
She’s doing an article on Peyton Sawyer and the nightclub TRIC.

01:02:51.505 --> 01:02:53.832
Oh, are you sure?

01:02:55.295 --> 01:02:56.700
Okay, thanks.

01:02:57.746 --> 01:02:58.610
You okay?

01:02:58.686 --> 01:03:01.392
The woman said that she knows all the columnists at the magazine

01:03:01.457 --> 01:03:04.210
and she’s never heard of Ellie Harp or the story.

01:03:04.705 --> 01:03:07.383
So… maybe you have the wrong magazine?

01:03:08.075 --> 01:03:09.321
Yeah, maybe.

01:03:13.278 --> 01:03:15.022
Every transaction is listed.

01:03:15.246 --> 01:03:18.500
The actual sale price and the price Dan declared to the government.

01:03:18.617 --> 01:03:21.261
He’s done it a thousand times Deb; it’s a federal offence.

01:03:21.808 --> 01:03:22.732
Prison?

01:03:25.115 --> 01:03:28.500
So… why are you bringing this to me? He’s my husband.

01:03:29.247 --> 01:03:31.120
And he’s my father.

01:03:31.675 --> 01:03:35.201
But… I figured you could use it to get away from him.

01:03:35.476 --> 01:03:36.563
To get out.

01:03:37.605 --> 01:03:39.201
You’d do that for me?

01:03:39.647 --> 01:03:43.072
Yeah, and for Nathan… and Keith…

01:03:43.297 --> 01:03:45.132
and everybody else he’s hurt.

01:03:46.428 --> 01:03:49.093
So… this is it.

01:03:49.658 --> 01:03:53.380
This is the smoking gun that can bring down Dan Scott.

01:03:53.887 --> 01:03:54.901
Yep.

01:04:13.617 --> 01:04:15.303
Looking for something?

01:04:25.088 --> 01:04:26.053
Where is it?

01:04:26.578 --> 01:04:27.222
Where’s what?

01:04:27.297 --> 01:04:29.103
Don’t play dumb with me! Where’s the ledger?!

01:04:29.397 --> 01:04:34.212
Oh, you mean the ledger that exposes my husband’s illegal activities over several years?

01:04:34.317 --> 01:04:35.972
Tell me that ledger doesn’t exist, Dan.

01:04:36.068 --> 01:04:37.381
You don’t see the big picture, Deb.

01:04:37.475 --> 01:04:39.032
Oh, I think I do.

01:04:39.147 --> 01:04:40.673
Just give me the damn book!

01:04:40.956 --> 01:04:44.601
You told Nathan that my addiction was his fault.

01:04:44.888 --> 01:04:46.251
What’re you talking about?

01:04:46.328 --> 01:04:48.861
You knew I wouldn’t come back unless Nathan was living here.

01:04:48.977 --> 01:04:50.873
Take another pill, Deb? You’re delusional.

01:04:50.978 --> 01:04:53.421
No, I was delusional:

01:04:53.508 --> 01:04:55.810
loving you, thinking you’d change.

01:04:56.146 --> 01:05:02.930
But I’ve got clarity now, Danny-boy, and I finally see you for the pathetic, broken man you are.

01:05:04.057 --> 01:05:05.322
Lemonade?

01:05:05.926 --> 01:05:09.351
You know, a guy like me works his entire life trying to build something.

01:05:10.146 --> 01:05:14.342
Trying to make his mark in the world; to provide for his family,

01:05:15.098 --> 01:05:19.321
working hour after hour to turn the seed of an idea into a successful business.

01:05:19.386 --> 01:05:20.710
A fraudulent business.

01:05:20.808 --> 01:05:24.010
A fraudulent business owned by my wife.

01:05:25.895 --> 01:05:28.943
You know, it’s a shame that ignorance isn’t an excuse, Deb,

01:05:29.417 --> 01:05:32.880
because when you turn in that ledger, both of Nathan’s parents will be felons.

01:05:33.397 --> 01:05:35.862
Hell, you’ll just go from one institution to the next.

01:05:35.968 --> 01:05:38.931
Today: the drunk tank, tomorrow: prison.

01:05:39.647 --> 01:05:40.941
You bastard.

01:05:41.168 --> 01:05:45.270
No, Deb, the bastard would’ve been Nathan; that is, if I wouldn’t have married you.

01:05:45.358 --> 01:05:47.180
And made us all so happy.

01:05:49.728 --> 01:05:51.473
Where’s the ledger, Deb?

01:06:09.707 --> 01:06:10.971
Hello?

01:06:11.088 --> 01:06:12.923
You can run but you can’t hide.

01:06:12.996 --> 01:06:13.922
Who is this?

01:06:14.018 --> 01:06:14.670
It’s Ellie.

01:06:14.758 --> 01:06:16.053
Where’d you get this number?

01:06:16.205 --> 01:06:17.260
Well, I-

01:06:17.328 --> 01:06:19.063
Leave me alone and don’t call me!

01:06:25.588 --> 01:06:26.372
Mom?

01:06:28.486 --> 01:06:29.331
Nate.

01:06:29.748 --> 01:06:31.761
What’s going on? You sounded freaked out on the phone.

01:06:32.155 --> 01:06:34.223
We’re gonna have to stay here for a while.

01:06:34.745 --> 01:06:35.553
What happened?

01:06:35.646 --> 01:06:39.061
Nathan, I’m so sorry. It’s just… your father has done some things.

01:06:39.346 --> 01:06:41.662
- What things? 
- Nothing that concerns you.

01:06:42.307 --> 01:06:44.183
But Lucas found something.

01:06:44.795 --> 01:06:45.520
Lucas.

01:06:45.617 --> 01:06:47.200
He was trying to help us.

01:06:47.307 --> 01:06:51.262
But it-it doesn’t matter now. What does matter is that you remember I love you…

01:06:51.558 --> 01:06:53.262
and I always will.

01:06:53.987 --> 01:06:55.140
We were gonna get out.

01:06:55.605 --> 01:06:58.840
And we still are, okay? I promise you.

01:06:58.938 --> 01:07:01.890
But… for now, that has to be our secret.

01:07:02.855 --> 01:07:05.362
I want you to go to High Flyers.

01:07:05.468 --> 01:07:08.262
Forget it! I’m not leaving you here alone with Dan!

01:07:08.346 --> 01:07:09.890
Nathan, I’ll be fine!

01:07:10.095 --> 01:07:14.193
You go to that camp and don’t look back for a second, do you understand me?

01:07:15.878 --> 01:07:17.252
It has to end.

01:07:17.885 --> 01:07:20.540
Yes… it does.

01:07:37.215 --> 01:07:38.823
Ah, here we go again.

01:07:38.908 --> 01:07:40.952
Oh, don’t mind me; I just need your measurements.

01:07:41.037 --> 01:07:44.383
Alright, I’ll play along; my measurements for what?

01:07:44.477 --> 01:07:46.682
For the pine box they’re gonna put you in.

01:07:47.668 --> 01:07:49.521
I’m about to bury you, Whitey.

01:07:50.296 --> 01:07:54.680
You crossed the line, Whitey; talking to Deb, meddling with Nathan.

01:07:55.086 --> 01:07:59.183
You know, I occupy a seat on the school board; I think we’re gonna make some changes next season.

01:07:59.258 --> 01:08:00.793
Don’t you threaten me!

01:08:00.898 --> 01:08:02.460
Oh, it’s not a threat!

01:08:02.557 --> 01:08:04.363
You’ve got some health concerns, don’t you?

01:08:04.687 --> 01:08:07.571
Bad eyes and all; that coupled with the first round playoff loss.

01:08:07.646 --> 01:08:08.541
Which you coached!

01:08:08.628 --> 01:08:09.983
Because you were ill!

01:08:11.036 --> 01:08:13.742
You know, it’s a shame you never won the state title, Whitey,

01:08:14.045 --> 01:08:16.080
because as far as I’m concerned…

01:08:16.296 --> 01:08:18.000
you’re never gonna coach again!

01:08:18.098 --> 01:08:20.151
You better be careful, son.

01:08:20.388 --> 01:08:23.593
You mess with my livelihood, I’ll mess with yours.

01:08:23.727 --> 01:08:25.591
Speaking of threats.

01:08:26.017 --> 01:08:27.852
You know, most people…

01:08:27.977 --> 01:08:32.923
when they go they leave the world a lesser place, but not you.

01:08:33.228 --> 01:08:36.712
No, the world won’t even blink.

01:08:36.808 --> 01:08:39.160
Well, you’d know, wouldn’t you, Whitey?

01:08:40.518 --> 01:08:43.192
You’re playing with fire, Danny…

01:08:43.417 --> 01:08:46.162
and you are about to get burned!

01:08:46.258 --> 01:08:48.191
Bring it on, old man.

01:08:57.805 --> 01:09:00.451
Okay, I’ve spoken with Deb so she’s gonna look after things.

01:09:00.546 --> 01:09:02.263
And all my numbers are near the phone.

01:09:02.377 --> 01:09:04.121
- Oh, and if Keith calls- 
- Mom…

01:09:05.497 --> 01:09:06.622
go.

01:09:08.006 --> 01:09:09.491
If you need anything…

01:09:10.216 --> 01:09:12.921
well I’ll only be… half a world away.

01:09:17.326 --> 01:09:19.033
Go find happiness, mom.

01:09:19.787 --> 01:09:20.751
I love you.

01:09:24.108 --> 01:09:25.231
I love you, too.

01:10:51.848 --> 01:10:53.582
Oh, he still hasn’t checked in?

01:10:54.368 --> 01:10:56.330
Oh-no, no message, thank you.

01:11:30.155 --> 01:11:31.521
- What’s going on? 
- Where is it?

01:11:32.728 --> 01:11:33.693
Where’s what?

01:11:33.777 --> 01:11:35.772
Whatever it is you have on my dad, where is it?

01:11:35.917 --> 01:11:36.891
Nathan, look.

01:11:37.007 --> 01:11:38.792
Lucas, you said you were done!

01:11:42.375 --> 01:11:44.223
Nate, you don’t wanna do that!

01:11:49.947 --> 01:11:52.340
I wanted to tell you… Nate.

01:11:53.105 --> 01:11:55.482
I was just… waiting for the right time.

01:11:55.976 --> 01:11:57.152
You went to see her.

01:11:58.755 --> 01:12:00.371
You’re just full of lies, aren’t you?

01:12:00.476 --> 01:12:01.141
Nathan!

01:12:01.235 --> 01:12:03.531
You don’t wanna push this right now, Lucas! Trust me!

01:12:07.697 --> 01:12:09.813
So the prodigal son returns.

01:12:12.117 --> 01:12:13.451
You looking for this?

01:12:15.405 --> 01:12:16.552
Or, maybe,

01:12:18.517 --> 01:12:19.591
you’re looking for this.

01:12:23.006 --> 01:12:24.691
Go on, take a closer look.

01:12:35.235 --> 01:12:36.801
How stupid do you think I’d be?

01:12:38.017 --> 01:12:39.673
Who keeps money in the ceiling?

01:12:39.895 --> 01:12:42.313
Or a ledger of their criminal activities?

01:12:42.908 --> 01:12:45.461
Uses jersey numbers as a combination.

01:12:45.617 --> 01:12:48.631
Although you did figure that out so you’re not entirely dense.

01:12:48.986 --> 01:12:49.841
Why?

01:12:49.935 --> 01:12:52.782
Why? To test your loyalty, Lucas.

01:12:53.575 --> 01:12:54.891
You know what the shame is?

01:12:56.827 --> 01:12:58.753
I would have given you the world, son.

01:13:00.147 --> 01:13:02.290
I would have welcomed you in with open arms.

01:13:03.725 --> 01:13:05.322
But you failed the test.

01:13:05.895 --> 01:13:07.840
And for that, you get nothing.

01:13:08.097 --> 01:13:10.140
For that, you are nothing.

01:13:14.187 --> 01:13:15.680
So it was all a lie?

01:13:16.805 --> 01:13:20.050
The money in the ceiling, the bank account in my name.

01:13:20.126 --> 01:13:21.883
No, the account was real.

01:13:22.117 --> 01:13:25.293
I built that since you were a boy, but that’s gone now, too.

01:13:25.527 --> 01:13:27.223
So’s your heart medication.

01:13:28.935 --> 01:13:31.552
The game’s over, you lose.

01:13:34.357 --> 01:13:35.153
No.

01:13:37.236 --> 01:13:38.333
You’re wrong.

01:13:40.866 --> 01:13:43.442
Because I can finally let you go.

01:13:46.447 --> 01:13:48.942
I mean nothing to you?

01:13:50.697 --> 01:13:52.643
You mean nothing to me.

01:13:52.945 --> 01:13:54.050
I’m out.

01:13:54.876 --> 01:13:56.482
That’s where you’re wrong.

01:13:59.808 --> 01:14:01.361
You’ll never be out.

01:14:02.147 --> 01:14:03.211
Son.

01:14:04.507 --> 01:14:05.752
We’ll see about that.

01:14:27.847 --> 01:14:33.521
Okay, that is the last bag, box or suitcase I shift this summer.

01:14:33.616 --> 01:14:34.832
Your cab’s on the way.

01:14:35.048 --> 01:14:36.840
- I don’t wanna go! 
- I know.

01:14:36.955 --> 01:14:40.102
And I don’t want you to go but life sucks like that.

01:14:40.367 --> 01:14:43.690
But, hey, you are going to be back in no time and then we will be seniors

01:14:43.735 --> 01:14:45.382
and oh what fun we will have then!

01:14:45.485 --> 01:14:46.343
Like what?

01:14:46.468 --> 01:14:49.060
Hm, like… kidnapping…

01:14:49.226 --> 01:14:51.701
and… getting married

01:14:51.956 --> 01:14:56.080
and… burning letters from guys before we read them.

01:14:57.198 --> 01:14:59.383
Speaking of, where is our boyfriend?

01:14:59.717 --> 01:15:00.662
I don’t know.

01:15:01.025 --> 01:15:03.443
I guess he’s not even coming to say goodbye to me.

01:15:04.346 --> 01:15:06.740
Suppose it’s a test… for the new me.

01:15:07.788 --> 01:15:09.223
I’m sure he will be here.

01:15:10.387 --> 01:15:12.241
I, on the other hand, will not.

01:15:12.407 --> 01:15:13.153
What!?

01:15:13.308 --> 01:15:17.123
I promised Karen I wouldn’t sleep on TRIC and I’ve gotta return the keys to Deb.

01:15:18.057 --> 01:15:19.042
I’m sorry.

01:15:20.368 --> 01:15:23.013
I’m gonna miss you, Brooke Penelope Davis.

01:15:23.117 --> 01:15:25.800
I’m gonna miss you, Peyton Elizabeth Sawyer.

01:15:30.056 --> 01:15:31.100
Hoes over Bros?

01:15:31.975 --> 01:15:33.462
Buds over Studs.

01:15:39.906 --> 01:15:41.353
I thought you weren’t talking to me.

01:15:41.465 --> 01:15:42.350
I’m not.

01:15:44.056 --> 01:15:45.323
I’m going to High Flyers.

01:15:46.856 --> 01:15:48.250
Nate, that’s great!

01:15:48.868 --> 01:15:52.052
When I get back… all this brother stuff is over.

01:15:53.317 --> 01:15:53.923
What?

01:15:54.008 --> 01:15:56.412
You lied to me, Lucas; about my dad…

01:15:56.936 --> 01:15:58.612
and about going to see Haley.

01:15:59.337 --> 01:16:01.091
I’ve got enough of that in my life.

01:16:01.207 --> 01:16:02.692
Nathan, I was trying to help.

01:16:02.796 --> 01:16:04.491
Yeah, well you can stop that now.

01:16:05.196 --> 01:16:08.653
All I need you to do for me is knock down shots next year, that’s it.

01:16:09.567 --> 01:16:10.883
We’re not brothers.

01:16:12.215 --> 01:16:13.582
We’re not even friends.

01:16:25.338 --> 01:16:26.501
Well…

01:16:28.758 --> 01:16:30.992
I’ll see ya, Brooke. Have a nice summer.

01:16:31.087 --> 01:16:32.583
Oh, thanks, everybody.

01:16:34.448 --> 01:16:35.763
Talking to yourself?

01:16:37.545 --> 01:16:40.742
What, is your… summer job driving a cab?

01:16:43.326 --> 01:16:44.870
I put your stuff in the car.

01:16:46.607 --> 01:16:48.561
So I guess this is goodbye?

01:17:11.118 --> 01:17:13.290
Tell me that was a goodbye kiss.

01:17:14.248 --> 01:17:16.011
I wanna be with you, Brooke.

01:17:18.998 --> 01:17:19.803
What?

01:17:19.915 --> 01:17:21.043
I’m sorry.

01:17:22.425 --> 01:17:23.873
I know we’re friends…

01:17:24.065 --> 01:17:25.563
it’s just how I feel.

01:17:26.675 --> 01:17:29.013
What about Peyton’s stuff?

01:17:29.126 --> 01:17:33.110
I keep that stuff as a reminder of how badly I screwed up things.

01:17:34.635 --> 01:17:35.512
With you.

01:17:36.668 --> 01:17:40.802
To remind myself, if I ever get a second chance…

01:17:41.237 --> 01:17:43.372
I’d never let you go again.

01:17:46.728 --> 01:17:48.342
I don’t know what to say.

01:17:49.166 --> 01:17:50.133
I, um…

01:17:57.005 --> 01:17:58.313
I gotta go.

01:18:00.727 --> 01:18:01.570
Brooke?

01:18:03.298 --> 01:18:05.792
You think… you could ever-

01:18:05.858 --> 01:18:07.032
Lucas…

01:18:09.067 --> 01:18:10.130
I’m sorry.

01:18:12.565 --> 01:18:15.510
I… I gotta go.

01:18:22.845 --> 01:18:23.803
Bye.

01:18:28.617 --> 01:18:30.260
Have a nice summer, Brooke.

01:19:33.205 --> 01:19:34.283
Jake...

01:19:44.276 --> 01:19:45.580
I know it’s late. I-

01:19:45.657 --> 01:19:47.902
You’re right… it is late.

01:19:48.018 --> 01:19:51.103
As a matter of fact, it’s half past the crazy bitch so leave me alone!

01:19:51.175 --> 01:19:53.293
Peyton, I can explain.

01:19:53.378 --> 01:19:55.922
Explain what!? That you’re a stalker…

01:19:56.007 --> 01:19:58.680
or that you’re insane and you’ve been sending me creepy e-mails?!

01:19:58.768 --> 01:19:59.963
I didn’t send you anything.

01:20:00.056 --> 01:20:04.282
Yeah, right. I called your supposed magazine; they’ve never even heard of you.

01:20:06.416 --> 01:20:08.331
My name is Elizabeth.

01:20:09.285 --> 01:20:11.870
Great, so even your name is a lie.

01:20:12.296 --> 01:20:15.891
Like your middle name: Elizabeth.

01:20:17.135 --> 01:20:19.092
It’s where you got your middle name.

01:20:22.685 --> 01:20:23.853
Who are you?

01:20:25.368 --> 01:20:26.553
I’m your mother.

01:21:54.687 --> 01:21:56.603
Oh, Nathan, I was hoping that was you.

01:21:56.778 --> 01:21:58.450
I’ve been here, alone, all night!

01:21:59.188 --> 01:22:00.910
I had… something to do.

01:22:01.808 --> 01:22:02.853
Oh, honey.

01:22:05.256 --> 01:22:10.261
I know this is hard for you but, I promise you, we’ll be free soon.

01:22:10.908 --> 01:22:12.093
I know we will.

01:22:16.068 --> 01:22:17.613
Do you need help with anything?

01:22:17.717 --> 01:22:20.641
No, I just… I have one more bag in the car.

01:22:22.455 --> 01:22:23.303
Okay.

01:22:40.445 --> 01:22:41.342
Hi.

01:23:08.436 --> 01:23:10.343
Looks like it’s just you and me this summer.

01:23:23.546 --> 01:23:25.621
Tennessee Williams once wrote:

01:23:26.745 --> 01:23:28.963
‘We all live in a house of fire.

01:23:29.826 --> 01:23:33.213
No fire department to call. No way out.

01:23:33.905 --> 01:23:36.402
Just the upstairs window to look out of-

01:23:38.078 --> 01:23:40.430
while the fire burns the house down…

01:23:41.605 --> 01:23:44.863
with us trapped, locked in it.’
