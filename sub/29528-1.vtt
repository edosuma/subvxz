WEBVTT

01:05.815 --> 01:08.401
Grace? Grace?

01:14.324 --> 01:18.620
Grace, come to me. Grace.

01:20.747 --> 01:22.332
Yes, I'm coming.

01:35.094 --> 01:37.639
Grace, come to me.

01:38.056 --> 01:40.016
Yes. I'm, I'm coming.

01:43.478 --> 01:46.272
Where are you? I'm here.

01:47.315 --> 01:50.860
What do you want?
Why can't you just leave me alone?

03:09.439 --> 03:12.025
- Well, here we are, Anna.
- Thanks for the ride.

03:12.525 --> 03:15.945
Don't even think about it.
You know I'd do anything for you.

03:16.905 --> 03:19.157
You've done enough already, Dr. Shaw.

03:20.283 --> 03:24.120
Anna, I want you to stop thinking
about me as your doctor.

03:24.203 --> 03:27.790
I'm also your friend.
I've always been your friend.

03:29.792 --> 03:32.754
- I know.
- Your father and I were very close.

03:32.837 --> 03:35.089
It was only right that I be the one
who looked after you.

03:35.173 --> 03:37.008
And I appreciate that.

03:37.884 --> 03:40.887
I'm sure my father's estate
took very good care of you, as well.

03:52.982 --> 03:54.692
Anna,

03:55.568 --> 04:00.073
I want nothing more
than for you to be happy.

04:01.491 --> 04:05.245
You're a wealthy girl.
You barely know this man.

04:06.663 --> 04:09.958
Well, I'm hoping
you didn't rush into this marriage.

04:10.041 --> 04:12.377
And what if I did?

04:13.336 --> 04:14.629
You could get hurt.

04:14.712 --> 04:17.882
Thanks for your concern,
but I'm no longer a patient.

04:59.340 --> 05:01.009
First time on the island?

05:01.676 --> 05:04.304
Yes. I heard it's a great place.

05:04.387 --> 05:08.308
And it's certainly isolated.
Not a lot for a young lady to do there.

05:08.391 --> 05:11.436
Ah, I don't mind.
I have plenty to keep me busy.

05:12.103 --> 05:13.479
You didn't rent a car?

05:13.563 --> 05:15.982
No, I'm being picked up. I'm moving here.

05:17.692 --> 05:19.777
I'm Mrs. Richard Palmer.

05:19.861 --> 05:23.031
I imagine you're going up
the, uh, lighthouse at Shorecliff.

05:23.114 --> 05:25.700
Yes. I've seen pictures.

05:25.783 --> 05:27.702
I think I'm already
falling in love with it.

05:28.453 --> 05:31.622
That's good.
That place could use some love.

05:52.101 --> 05:54.937
<i>Hi, this is Richard.
I can't come to the phone right now.</i>

05:55.021 --> 05:57.624
<i>Please leave your name and number,
and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.</i>

05:57.648 --> 05:59.776
Hey, hon, it's me.

05:59.859 --> 06:02.737
Um, I'm here on the island and I...
I don't see you anywhere.

06:02.820 --> 06:05.656
Can you please give me a call
as soon as possible?

06:06.032 --> 06:07.408
You havin' some trouble?

06:07.492 --> 06:09.494
I just don't know where my husband is.

06:09.577 --> 06:11.412
Ah, I'm sure he'll be along shortly.

06:11.496 --> 06:16.584
I hope so. Uh, is there any place
I can go to get out of this cold?

06:16.667 --> 06:20.254
Yeah. Yeah, The, uh, Sail Croft.
About a block up the road.

06:20.338 --> 06:22.507
I'll tell you what,
I'll leave word with the guys.

06:22.590 --> 06:24.860
If your husband shows up,
we'll tell him that's where you're at.

06:24.884 --> 06:26.761
Well, thank you. Here.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.721
Oh, no, no, no. That's not necessary.

06:28.805 --> 06:31.641
No, please, you guys have a drink on me.
It's chilly.

06:31.724 --> 06:33.226
All right. But you didn't have to.

07:05.675 --> 07:06.676
Mornin', miss.

07:07.677 --> 07:09.345
Can I just get a cup of hot tea?

07:10.012 --> 07:12.348
Hot tea. You expecting anyone else?

07:12.765 --> 07:16.352
My husband. But I don't know
if he'll be wanting anything.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.937
Well, who's your husband?

07:18.020 --> 07:19.355
Richard Palmer.

07:22.066 --> 07:23.609
I heard he got remarried recently.

07:25.653 --> 07:26.654
So I heard.

07:28.197 --> 07:29.866
I'm so sorry. I'm Carrie.

07:31.367 --> 07:32.368
Anna.

07:32.452 --> 07:35.413
- Let me get that tea for you.
- Thank you.

07:37.999 --> 07:40.668
<i>Hi, this is Richard.
I can't come to the phone right now.</i>

07:40.751 --> 07:43.791
<i>Please leave your name and number,
and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.</i>

07:49.343 --> 07:50.344
No luck, still?

07:51.846 --> 07:56.392
It just keeps going straight to voicemail.
I don't know what happened.

07:57.351 --> 07:58.895
Do you need a ride to Shorecliff?

08:01.147 --> 08:04.775
I don't know, I should probably
just stay put and wait here for him.

08:05.651 --> 08:08.696
Well, you let me know
if you change your mind.

08:08.779 --> 08:10.239
And thank you for the drink.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.575
- You're welcome.
- Irish coffee.

08:16.078 --> 08:17.246
Who was that?

08:17.330 --> 08:21.292
Richard! Where have you been?

08:21.375 --> 08:22.960
I thought you forgot all about me.

08:23.044 --> 08:24.253
Oh, the car wouldn't start.

08:24.337 --> 08:25.856
Might be something
to do with the ignition.

08:25.880 --> 08:28.007
It's okay. You're here now.

08:28.966 --> 08:29.842
Here's your tea.

08:29.926 --> 08:32.970
Um, can I actually get that to go, please?

08:33.304 --> 08:34.429
Sure thing.

08:35.097 --> 08:37.433
- Thank you.
- You can enjoy your tea. There's no rush.

08:37.517 --> 08:40.102
That's all right.
I'm just really anxious to see Shorecliff.

08:41.145 --> 08:43.356
I'll bet you are.

08:43.438 --> 08:45.107
Hey, who's that guy you were talking to?

08:46.108 --> 08:47.401
How's the weather out there?

08:48.402 --> 08:51.239
He's the captain of the ferry.
Uh, Captain Hanson.

08:51.822 --> 08:54.617
Oh. Captain Hanson. That's right.

08:55.785 --> 08:57.161
Thank you, Carrie.

08:57.245 --> 08:58.496
I'll get your bags.

08:59.288 --> 09:01.040
- Thanks, honey.
- Let's go, sweetie.

09:24.689 --> 09:26.941
Welcome to Shorecliff.

09:27.024 --> 09:28.192
Oh!

09:28.276 --> 09:30.486
Is it anything like you imagined
it would be?

09:31.028 --> 09:32.738
No, it's... It's much grander.

09:32.822 --> 09:37.118
Grander? You should reserve
your judgement until you've been inside.

09:37.201 --> 09:40.079
It doesn't matter
what it looks like inside.

09:40.162 --> 09:42.873
It's my new home. Our new home,

09:42.957 --> 09:46.627
where we're gonna start our life together.
It's absolutely perfect.

09:47.878 --> 09:50.548
Well, maybe you'd like to see the island
from the top of the light.

09:50.631 --> 09:51.882
It's an amazing view.

09:51.966 --> 09:56.095
No. No, thank you.
I don't like closed spaces.

09:56.178 --> 09:57.597
I thought I told you that.

09:58.097 --> 10:00.766
Oh, that's right. You did tell me.

10:00.850 --> 10:03.561
No closed spaces. I'm sorry, I forgot.

10:03.644 --> 10:04.645
Hmm.

10:05.104 --> 10:07.315
Well, let's get you inside
before you blow away.

10:07.398 --> 10:09.275
- Okay.
- Come on.

10:13.404 --> 10:15.906
There. Now, it's all official.

10:17.617 --> 10:18.868
I love you, Richard.

10:18.951 --> 10:22.872
I love you, too, Mrs. Palmer.
Oh! So sweet.

10:29.754 --> 10:32.423
- Come on, let me show you the house.
- Oh!

10:33.883 --> 10:35.092
What do you think?

10:35.593 --> 10:38.012
- It's beautiful.
- Come on in here.

10:45.936 --> 10:47.730
Oh! It's incredible.

10:48.773 --> 10:49.815
You like it?

10:51.859 --> 10:53.194
Yes, of course.

10:54.236 --> 10:56.697
My great-great-grandfather
founded this island

10:56.781 --> 10:59.909
when he took on the task
of lighthouse-keeping back in 1875.

11:01.994 --> 11:03.329
And what is this room?

11:03.412 --> 11:07.541
Well, this is my study.
This is where I write.

11:07.625 --> 11:10.628
It's my private space
where I grind out all my books.

11:11.629 --> 11:15.424
Oh, so I'm guessing I won't be allowed
in here very much, then.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.343
No.

11:18.344 --> 11:21.597
But once you see the living room,
you won't wanna hang out in here, anyway.

11:21.680 --> 11:22.932
Come on.

11:26.394 --> 11:28.854
And this is the main room.

11:28.938 --> 11:31.315
Nothing's been changed in here
in almost a hundred years.

11:31.399 --> 11:33.067
Even the drapes?

11:33.150 --> 11:36.612
That's right.
Look, I'm gonna take your bags upstairs.

11:36.695 --> 11:38.948
Why don't you take a look
around your new house

11:39.031 --> 11:41.033
and see if the mistress approves?

12:01.720 --> 12:03.431
You are so beautiful.

12:13.107 --> 12:17.027
I think you would look good
over here, by the ship.

12:18.696 --> 12:22.450
Right there.
That way, if you wanna go back to the sea,

12:22.533 --> 12:26.579
you can just hop on board.
That's better, isn't it?

12:27.288 --> 12:29.957
Mrs. Palmer would never
approve of moving that.

12:30.040 --> 12:31.876
I'm sorry, I didn't hear anyone come in.

12:37.465 --> 12:43.179
She used to sit here and play
every night before supper.

12:44.180 --> 12:45.764
She was quite accomplished.

12:46.515 --> 12:48.559
She liked her mermaid close by.

12:49.685 --> 12:52.688
She liked to feel the delicate features.

12:53.564 --> 12:56.484
So, you can understand why
she wouldn't want it moved, can't you?

12:57.234 --> 12:58.652
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

13:00.738 --> 13:06.076
- Anna.
- Mrs. Argyle. I take care of the house.

13:06.744 --> 13:09.747
I wouldn't want to be any trouble,
Mrs. Argyle. As you can see...

13:09.830 --> 13:13.626
You're not blind.
I couldn't help but notice.

13:13.709 --> 13:15.252
I didn't mean it like that.

13:16.670 --> 13:20.090
Mrs. Palmer may have been blind
in the conventional sense, but she...

13:20.174 --> 13:21.342
I'm sorry.

13:22.259 --> 13:24.011
I don't mean to be rude,

13:24.595 --> 13:26.972
but I am Mrs. Palmer.

13:27.932 --> 13:29.391
Of course, you are.

13:31.810 --> 13:33.479
Lunch is ready, Mrs. Palmer.

13:40.945 --> 13:44.949
Dinner is at 7:00. 7:00, sharp.
I leave at 7:30.

13:45.991 --> 13:47.910
I'll be sure to keep an eye on the time.

13:49.453 --> 13:52.873
Mrs... Grace appreciated routine.

13:53.999 --> 13:57.211
It became her inner clock.
She never missed a thing.

14:00.339 --> 14:03.342
She was never late.
She appreciated routine.

14:06.679 --> 14:10.724
Mr. Palmer does, as well.
It made their world run smoothly.

14:14.311 --> 14:15.771
How did she die?

14:19.900 --> 14:23.529
Perhaps, you should ask your husband.
I just keep the house.

14:51.265 --> 14:53.392
Ah, there you are.

14:53.475 --> 14:55.561
I met Mrs. Argyle.

14:56.979 --> 15:01.191
Oh. I hope she didn't scare you.
She has that effect on people.

15:01.483 --> 15:07.823
Well, she was a bit intimidating at first,
but I'm sure we'll get along just fine.

15:08.240 --> 15:13.203
Good. Turkey again. It's always turkey.

15:13.287 --> 15:15.664
You think we could have
something different once in a while.

15:16.290 --> 15:17.583
Don't you like routine?

15:17.666 --> 15:20.336
Routine? No, I hate it.

15:20.419 --> 15:22.922
Who wants
the same old thing every day?

15:24.882 --> 15:26.300
Who indeed?

15:27.718 --> 15:30.012
Listen, uh, don't worry
about Mrs. Argyle, okay?

15:30.095 --> 15:33.933
I mean, she creeps around this place
like a ghost from the 19th century.

15:34.016 --> 15:35.142
She's harmless.

15:35.809 --> 15:37.019
I'm not worried.

15:37.853 --> 15:40.648
I saw you speaking to someone outside.

15:42.358 --> 15:44.568
Oh, that. Yeah.

15:46.070 --> 15:48.072
I... I needed to order a part for the car.

15:48.155 --> 15:51.200
Um, we have a mechanic on the island,
but no parts.

15:52.326 --> 15:54.286
Everything has to be brought in
from the mainland.

15:54.370 --> 15:55.663
That's a drag.

15:55.746 --> 15:58.040
Yeah. You get used to it.

15:59.458 --> 16:02.795
I just hope it gets here before the car
decides to crap out entirely.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.298
Where are you going?

16:08.842 --> 16:12.805
Ah, so many questions today.
I have to go work on my book.

16:12.888 --> 16:14.648
I have some story points
I need to hammer out

16:14.723 --> 16:17.184
before I lose my train of thought.

16:17.267 --> 16:19.979
Can't that wait until tomorrow?
I just got here.

16:20.062 --> 16:23.190
I know. But, no, it won't.

16:23.315 --> 16:24.858
Everything is in my head.

16:24.942 --> 16:27.695
And if I don't strike now,
I'll forget it later.

16:29.029 --> 16:31.699
Why don't you unpack your things
and have a rest?

16:32.366 --> 16:34.201
The first bedroom on the right,
up the stairs.

16:35.619 --> 16:37.079
I'll be done soon enough.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.164
All right.

16:41.959 --> 16:44.128
Mrs. Grace never questioned her husband.

16:44.837 --> 16:46.672
She knew how important his work was.

16:46.755 --> 16:50.634
Mrs. Argyle, if you don't mind,
I'm a little tired.

16:52.094 --> 16:53.554
Good day, Mrs. Palmer.

17:32.676 --> 17:33.802
Who's there?

18:08.128 --> 18:09.463
Well, you must've been tired.

18:10.172 --> 18:11.507
Why didn't you wake me up?

18:11.590 --> 18:13.342
I thought you could use your rest.

18:13.425 --> 18:16.637
I mean, it's been a pretty long day,
what, with the ferry ride and all.

18:17.179 --> 18:18.597
It's after 8:00.

18:20.974 --> 18:25.687
Dinner's gone by, and sweet old
Mrs. Argyle never stays past 7:30.

18:25.771 --> 18:27.815
But there is a plate in the oven for you.

18:27.898 --> 18:31.193
And I also opened a bottle of wine
for you. It's by the window.

18:31.693 --> 18:32.861
Thank you.

18:33.779 --> 18:36.406
Hey, honey, before I came downstairs,

18:36.490 --> 18:39.535
I thought I heard the strangest noise
from outside the room.

18:40.369 --> 18:41.954
It was a sort of tapping sound.

18:42.037 --> 18:44.623
Well, this house is almost 200 years old.

18:44.706 --> 18:47.292
I think it's entitled to a few
strange sounds now and again.

18:47.376 --> 18:48.669
Go eat your dinner.

20:11.793 --> 20:13.170
Good morning, Mrs. Palmer.

20:14.087 --> 20:15.297
Good morning.

20:16.798 --> 20:18.508
Your breakfast is in the oven.

20:18.592 --> 20:19.760
Thank you.

20:19.843 --> 20:22.346
I'm sorry, you slept later
than I'm used to.

20:22.429 --> 20:24.181
Eggs do not reheat well.

20:25.432 --> 20:27.601
That's all right, I'm not very hungry.

20:28.602 --> 20:30.729
I can make breakfast
later than I normally do,

20:30.812 --> 20:31.980
if that's what you'd like.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.982
Don't change anything on my account.

20:34.858 --> 20:37.486
I don't usually sleep this late,
I just zoned out last night.

20:37.569 --> 20:38.904
Whatever you say.

20:40.447 --> 20:41.823
Do you know where Richard is?

20:42.532 --> 20:46.328
Mr. Palmer had breakfast at 8:00 a.m.
He's working now.

20:46.787 --> 20:48.580
Then I won't bother him.

20:48.664 --> 20:50.290
That would be best.

21:21.613 --> 21:23.824
Ah! That didn't take long.

21:24.491 --> 21:28.662
Well, you know how
Harold can get to talking.

21:29.413 --> 21:31.164
I figured I'd better get out of there

21:31.248 --> 21:34.918
before he started in on how bad
the drugstore business has been.

21:35.794 --> 21:39.339
People just aren't getting sick fast
enough to suit him, I guess.

21:39.423 --> 21:42.342
He is the only man
I know who gets excited

21:42.426 --> 21:43.844
when flu season rolls around.

21:45.762 --> 21:50.100
Oh... I stopped by
The Sail Croft for a coffee.

21:51.560 --> 21:55.772
And that waitress, Carrie, said that
Richard Palmer's new wife had arrived.

21:56.606 --> 21:57.858
New wife?

21:57.941 --> 22:01.069
Well, that didn't take long.

22:01.737 --> 22:04.573
It must be a very lonely life
in that lighthouse.

22:04.656 --> 22:08.368
But just the same, you think
he could've waited a little while.

22:08.452 --> 22:10.037
Oh, no. I can't agree.

22:10.120 --> 22:14.583
I'm glad he married again.
A man needs a wife.

22:14.666 --> 22:17.627
Hmm. Wonder what she's like.

22:17.711 --> 22:21.923
Carrie said she was very pretty.
And very young.

22:22.007 --> 22:24.301
Well, I can imagine.

22:24.384 --> 22:29.097
And I suppose you're anxious
to run over there and have a look at her.

22:29.181 --> 22:35.145
Well, Mrs. Argyle did say she put together
a package for the rummage sale.

22:35.228 --> 22:38.065
Someone has to get it.

22:38.648 --> 22:41.276
Oh, all right, but you hurry back.

22:41.359 --> 22:43.570
We've got a lot of other pick-ups
to do, you know?

22:45.906 --> 22:47.407
I'll report back as soon as I can.

22:49.326 --> 22:50.494
Oh! Get...

23:56.059 --> 23:57.060
Hello.

23:58.019 --> 23:59.020
Hello.

24:00.313 --> 24:04.526
So, what a windy day it is, huh?

24:06.820 --> 24:08.572
I'm sorry, can I help you?

24:08.655 --> 24:13.326
Oh. Well, yes, uh, I believe so.
Are you Mrs. Palmer?

24:14.452 --> 24:16.454
Yes, I am. Anna Palmer.

24:16.538 --> 24:19.666
Ah, Anna. What a pretty name.
I'm the Reverend Samuel Thomas.

24:19.749 --> 24:23.295
I heard in town that Richard
had taken himself a new bride,

24:23.378 --> 24:25.505
and I simply had to introduce myself.

24:27.215 --> 24:30.552
Well, it's nice of you to ride your bike
all the way here just to meet me.

24:30.635 --> 24:33.138
Oh, it's no trouble at all.

24:33.221 --> 24:37.934
Riding the old bike is very therapeutic
and I need the exercise.

24:38.727 --> 24:40.645
Or so my wife keeps telling me.

24:41.980 --> 24:45.901
Besides, I believe, Mrs. Argyle
had collected a bundle of donations

24:45.984 --> 24:49.863
for our church's annual rummage sale
that I would love to pick up.

24:49.946 --> 24:52.991
Mmm-hmm. A bundle?

24:54.034 --> 24:56.203
I think I know what you're talking about.

24:56.286 --> 24:59.080
Would you like to come inside
for a cup of tea or coffee?

24:59.831 --> 25:02.250
- That would be very nice.
- Oh. Okay.

25:04.836 --> 25:07.130
I see you're catching up
on your husband's literary work.

25:07.214 --> 25:08.632
Ah! Yes.

25:11.509 --> 25:12.719
- Thank you.
- Oh.

25:13.220 --> 25:16.973
<i>Pretty As Poison.</i>
Where does he come up with these plots?

25:17.057 --> 25:20.810
Yeah, who knows? But people buy them.

25:21.645 --> 25:24.856
Deception, betrayal,
and good old-fashioned murder.

25:25.565 --> 25:27.776
What a funny way to make a living.

25:29.152 --> 25:30.946
Is he working on anything
new at the moment?

25:31.696 --> 25:34.741
Oh, yes, of course, but it's a big secret.

25:34.824 --> 25:37.369
Ah. He won't talk about it, huh?

25:37.452 --> 25:38.745
Not even a peep.

25:38.828 --> 25:42.374
Well, Richard's always been
on the quiet side.

25:42.457 --> 25:44.042
How long have you known him?

25:44.793 --> 25:49.339
Oh. Uh, since he was a teenager, I guess.

25:50.507 --> 25:52.092
How long have you known him?

25:54.094 --> 25:57.180
I'm a bit embarrassed to say,
but it's only been three months.

25:58.181 --> 26:02.852
Three months? It must have been
a case of love at first sight, huh?

26:02.936 --> 26:05.939
Oh, I've never felt so pursued in my life.

26:06.022 --> 26:08.066
He absolutely wouldn't take
no for an answer.

26:08.149 --> 26:09.901
He just had to marry me.

26:10.652 --> 26:15.240
Then it must be love.
Well, I hope you'll be very happy here.

26:16.324 --> 26:19.828
Thank you.
Let me go get that bundle for you.

26:19.911 --> 26:21.204
Oh, thank you.

26:34.759 --> 26:36.219
All right, here it is.

26:36.720 --> 26:41.057
Oh, yes.
Some of Grace's things, I believe.

26:41.141 --> 26:43.393
Very thoughtful of you people.

26:43.476 --> 26:47.188
She was such a lovely lady.
She had such nice things.

26:48.315 --> 26:49.774
What was she like?

26:51.526 --> 26:54.404
Well, uh, when we first met,

26:55.488 --> 26:57.532
she was very sweet, very kind.

26:57.615 --> 27:02.871
So full of life, always smiling.
Generous to a fault.

27:04.122 --> 27:07.125
And then... Well...

27:11.171 --> 27:12.297
Well, what?

27:13.173 --> 27:14.591
Well, the illness.

27:16.468 --> 27:18.261
If it wasn't for Mrs. Argyle,

27:18.345 --> 27:22.015
who knows how long poor Grace
would've lasted here.

27:23.808 --> 27:25.185
What happened to her?

27:25.852 --> 27:28.646
She fell from the tower platform
one night.

27:29.939 --> 27:33.860
No one knows why she was
even up there at all, but she fell,

27:34.778 --> 27:36.446
or so they believe.

27:37.405 --> 27:38.948
Richard was out of town at the time,

27:39.032 --> 27:41.826
so she wasn't missed
till the next morning.

27:43.203 --> 27:44.621
Is she buried nearby?

27:45.622 --> 27:47.332
She's not buried at all.

27:48.875 --> 27:50.335
They never found her body.

27:52.295 --> 27:53.546
Only her cane.

28:05.141 --> 28:06.976
Well, uh...

28:07.727 --> 28:10.855
Good day to you, Mrs. Palmer.
And thank you.

28:11.648 --> 28:16.861
Reverend, could I invite you
to dinner tonight?

28:17.695 --> 28:18.696
Tonight?

28:19.823 --> 28:22.659
I'm sure Richard would love
to see you and your wife.

28:22.784 --> 28:24.994
Uh, well, uh...

28:25.078 --> 28:29.499
I guess it would be impolite
to pass on such a generous invitation.

28:30.291 --> 28:33.294
Okay, great.
Dinner will be at 7:00 p.m., sharp.

28:34.546 --> 28:37.757
7:00 it is. We'll try not to be late.

28:37.841 --> 28:38.967
Okay.

28:58.778 --> 29:02.115
Look, I told you I can't come up
with all of it right now.

29:02.198 --> 29:03.992
Well, of course, you'll get it.

29:04.784 --> 29:06.411
It might just take me another week.

29:07.287 --> 29:09.164
Yes, I understand.

29:10.290 --> 29:12.167
No, I'm not looking for any trouble.

29:14.169 --> 29:17.964
All... All right. Well, of course.

29:18.047 --> 29:19.174
As soon as I can.

29:20.550 --> 29:22.750
- I have to go in to town, honey.
- Oh, can I come with?

29:22.802 --> 29:25.930
Ah, not this time, sweetheart.
It's kind of a private matter.

29:27.932 --> 29:29.601
Something you can't share with me?

29:30.435 --> 29:34.439
Uh, it's... It's not that. It's just...

29:34.522 --> 29:38.151
You see, I was expecting a check
from my publisher, and it hasn't arrived.

29:38.234 --> 29:41.237
Now, I need to go see someone at the bank
and straighten out a few things.

29:42.405 --> 29:45.408
Why didn't you just say so? I can write
you a check until yours comes in.

29:45.492 --> 29:48.203
It's okay. I wouldn't want
to touch your inheritance.

29:48.286 --> 29:49.370
That would not be right.

29:50.914 --> 29:55.084
No, I'll deal with this on my own.
I'll think of something.

29:55.168 --> 29:58.421
Don't be like that. I'm your wife.
Let me help you.

29:58.505 --> 30:00.840
What good is money if you don't do
something good with it?

30:01.508 --> 30:03.760
Well, I, I really shouldn't.

30:03.843 --> 30:07.055
But it would only be for a week,
at the most. Are you sure?

30:07.138 --> 30:10.517
- Of course. Let's go get my checkbook.
- Great.

30:17.565 --> 30:18.983
How much do we need?

30:19.067 --> 30:21.027
Five thousand dollars.

30:23.863 --> 30:24.948
Okay.

30:26.616 --> 30:31.287
Five thousand dollars.

30:31.371 --> 30:33.665
Don't put my name on it.
Just, uh, leave it blank.

30:34.958 --> 30:35.959
Why?

30:36.042 --> 30:38.044
Well, I'm not sure which of the accounts

30:38.127 --> 30:40.797
I need to put it in to until
I meet with the bank manager.

30:41.673 --> 30:43.091
Oh, okay.

30:46.427 --> 30:50.098
All right. Be careful.
If this thing gets lost...

30:50.181 --> 30:52.016
Don't worry. I'll take good care of it.

30:55.937 --> 30:58.857
Honey, I invited the Reverend Thomas
and his wife to dinner tonight.

30:59.858 --> 31:00.859
You did what?

31:01.526 --> 31:05.280
Well, he came by earlier today,
and he was so nice,

31:05.363 --> 31:07.824
and I don't really have
any friends here yet, so...

31:08.408 --> 31:12.078
No. Of course, there's no...
It's no problem. It's fine.

31:12.161 --> 31:16.416
Really, it is. Just, uh, let Mrs. Argyle
know, and I'll be home soon.

31:25.633 --> 31:28.678
- You have my money!
- Yes. I have your money, all right?

31:28.761 --> 31:30.364
- All of it this time?
- I don't have all of it.

31:30.388 --> 31:31.514
I told you, another week.

31:31.598 --> 31:33.933
You need another week?
I have been waiting as it is.

31:34.017 --> 31:36.185
I want that money right now!

31:37.437 --> 31:41.065
Here! I'll have the rest for you later.

31:46.905 --> 31:47.906
Okay.

32:02.462 --> 32:04.213
I brought you some fresh towels.

32:04.589 --> 32:05.590
Thank you.

32:09.677 --> 32:11.012
What a pretty dress.

32:12.472 --> 32:14.557
Thank you.
I wanted to look nice for Richard.

32:15.642 --> 32:17.143
I'm sure he'll approve.

32:18.686 --> 32:20.063
Where's your jewelry?

32:21.064 --> 32:22.917
It's on the mainland
with the rest of my things.

32:22.941 --> 32:24.567
Maybe in a week or two.

32:30.907 --> 32:32.325
You should wear this.

32:34.535 --> 32:35.536
It's stunning.

32:36.371 --> 32:38.247
It's an old family heirloom.

32:41.793 --> 32:43.294
Do you think Richard would like it?

32:44.462 --> 32:45.505
I know he would.

32:47.882 --> 32:49.133
It's perfect.

32:49.842 --> 32:51.928
It's amazing how well you've managed

32:52.011 --> 32:55.974
to maintain the original integrity
of this old house, Richard.

32:56.057 --> 32:59.978
Most people would have modernized
the whole interior ages ago.

33:00.061 --> 33:03.439
I'd love to, but that would require
some financial resources

33:03.523 --> 33:05.733
that are beyond my means at the moment.

33:05.817 --> 33:08.319
And besides, the Historical Society

33:08.403 --> 33:10.446
is pretty intent on us
not changing anything.

33:10.530 --> 33:14.534
I imagine it looks very much like it did
when your great-great-grandfather,

33:14.617 --> 33:16.703
Captain Palmer, first settled the island.

33:16.786 --> 33:19.497
There have been some improvements
to be sure,

33:19.580 --> 33:21.457
but not too many in the last 50 years.

33:21.541 --> 33:23.751
What does Anna think of all this?

33:23.835 --> 33:26.754
It must be quite a change for someone
from the mainland.

33:26.838 --> 33:30.425
It'll take her a little while to adjust,
but she'll be fine.

33:31.342 --> 33:33.594
What's keeping your young bride?

33:35.513 --> 33:37.849
Well, I'm sure she's still upstairs
getting dressed.

33:37.932 --> 33:38.993
She'll be down in a minute.

33:39.017 --> 33:42.061
Why don't I go up and see
if she needs any help?

33:42.145 --> 33:43.688
You know how women can be.

33:43.771 --> 33:46.899
Everything has to be perfect,
right down to the smallest detail.

33:46.983 --> 33:49.193
Top of the stairs,
first door on the right.

33:52.822 --> 33:54.490
Emma's right, you know.

33:54.574 --> 33:57.577
It's a wonder we ever get out
of the house at all.

33:57.660 --> 33:59.203
Too true. Cheers.

34:00.997 --> 34:01.998
Come in.

34:03.875 --> 34:05.501
- Anna?
- Yes?

34:05.585 --> 34:07.712
I'm Emma. Reverend Thomas's wife.

34:08.755 --> 34:11.549
I'm sorry, Mrs. Thomas.

34:11.632 --> 34:14.302
I invited you to dinner
and I've been a terrible hostess.

34:14.385 --> 34:17.263
Oh, don't be silly. I just came up
to see if I could help you.

34:17.346 --> 34:18.473
Ah, I'm all done.

34:18.556 --> 34:21.976
Oh, what a lovely necklace!

34:22.060 --> 34:25.646
Thank you. Why don't we go downstairs?
I'm starving.

34:25.730 --> 34:27.065
Me, too.

34:33.487 --> 34:35.739
Nevertheless,
you've done a wonderful job

34:35.822 --> 34:37.867
of doing almost nothing at all.

34:37.949 --> 34:42.789
In fact, the less you do,
the better things seem to turn out.

34:42.871 --> 34:45.373
Believe me, Reverend, it was easy.

34:46.542 --> 34:47.752
Good evening, Reverend.

34:49.045 --> 34:52.380
Ah! You look lovely.

34:56.636 --> 34:59.764
Don't you just love it?
I wore it just for you.

34:59.847 --> 35:01.933
How dare you?

35:02.016 --> 35:03.267
What are you doing?

35:04.227 --> 35:06.187
- What? I thought...
- Take it off.

35:06.896 --> 35:08.189
Richard...

35:08.272 --> 35:11.275
Don't just stand there.
I said, take that thing off!

35:11.359 --> 35:12.860
Dinner's served.

35:14.445 --> 35:17.156
But you, you said... But...

35:17.240 --> 35:18.699
I'll clean up in the morning.

35:20.910 --> 35:24.539
What are you waiting for?
Get out! Get out!

35:26.749 --> 35:27.750
Oh!

35:34.257 --> 35:37.718
He loves me. I know he loves me.

35:38.845 --> 35:40.721
He just doesn't know how to show it.

35:41.639 --> 35:45.226
He will, soon. He has to.

35:51.732 --> 35:54.193
I'm, uh, so sorry
about what just happened.

35:54.277 --> 35:56.362
I mean,
I let my emotions get the better of me.

35:58.739 --> 36:02.160
Seeing Anna wearing Grace's necklace,
I... I just lost it.

36:02.577 --> 36:05.037
Please don't feel
like you have to leave.

36:05.121 --> 36:06.998
I... I'll go talk to her.

36:07.915 --> 36:12.128
Under the circumstances, uh,
I think it would be best that we go.

36:12.211 --> 36:15.506
You and Anna need some
alone time together.

36:16.507 --> 36:21.137
Trust me, Richard, she meant no harm.
I'm sure she didn't even realize.

36:21.220 --> 36:24.557
I know. Uh, you're right.
And it's all my fault.

36:24.640 --> 36:27.977
Well, thank you for coming,
and have a good night.

36:28.519 --> 36:33.149
Goodnight, Richard. Oh, and don't forget.
The church rummage sale is tomorrow.

36:33.232 --> 36:34.692
We hope to see you there.

36:35.568 --> 36:37.445
Don't worry. We'll be there.

37:15.775 --> 37:16.901
Well, that went well.

37:18.069 --> 37:19.153
What are you doing here?

37:19.654 --> 37:21.572
Don't get cute with me, Richard.

37:21.656 --> 37:23.342
Everybody's talking about
your new little wife.

37:23.366 --> 37:25.451
I just wanted to see her for myself.

37:26.702 --> 37:30.915
Besides, in case you forgot,
you do what I tell you to.

37:32.208 --> 37:33.417
What do you think?

37:38.130 --> 37:41.175
I don't think
we have anything to worry about.

38:42.778 --> 38:45.489
Richard? Honey?

38:51.704 --> 38:56.042
Richard? Honey, are you up there?

38:59.086 --> 39:01.922
Hey, open up the door!

39:02.631 --> 39:05.593
Somebody help me! Get me out of here!
Open this door!

39:09.013 --> 39:10.765
Anna! Anna, are you all right?

39:10.848 --> 39:12.868
Hell, no, I'm not all right!
There's someone in there.

39:12.892 --> 39:14.435
- In where?
- In the tower.

39:14.518 --> 39:16.038
- That can't be.
- There's someone in there.

39:16.062 --> 39:19.148
- And someone locked that door.
- All right. Just calm down and wait here.

39:43.881 --> 39:44.924
Well?

39:45.007 --> 39:47.802
The door just got stuck.
It does that sometimes.

39:47.885 --> 39:49.595
You just have to push on it really hard.

39:49.678 --> 39:51.038
Did you go all the way to the top?

39:51.097 --> 39:53.933
No, I didn't need to.
I could see there wasn't anyone up there.

39:54.016 --> 39:55.351
Did you check the platform?

39:55.434 --> 39:57.686
Would you like to go up there
and check for yourself?

39:57.770 --> 39:59.522
You know I can't do that.

39:59.605 --> 40:01.965
Well, then, you're gonna have
to take my word for it, honey.

40:02.024 --> 40:05.486
Look, you're upset.
Let me fix you a drink. Come on.

40:25.047 --> 40:26.632
Here you go, sweetheart.

40:30.678 --> 40:32.805
Thank God you heard me.

40:34.723 --> 40:37.226
Well, why were you even in the tower
to begin with?

40:37.309 --> 40:40.354
I was looking for you.
I heard that noise again.

40:40.438 --> 40:41.689
What noise?

40:41.772 --> 40:45.609
That tapping sound from last night.
Where were you?

40:45.693 --> 40:47.236
I was...

40:48.404 --> 40:51.323
I was ashamed of my behavior
earlier this evening.

40:52.158 --> 40:54.368
I made a fool of myself and I hurt you.

40:54.452 --> 40:56.120
I couldn't face you.

40:57.788 --> 41:00.583
I went to the study to clean up
some of my notes,

41:00.666 --> 41:03.085
and I... I guess
I fell asleep in the chair.

41:03.794 --> 41:05.504
There is someone else in this house.

41:05.588 --> 41:06.589
Anna, please.

41:06.672 --> 41:08.132
No, I'm being serious.

41:08.924 --> 41:11.260
All right. Was it a man or a woman?

41:14.305 --> 41:15.848
I don't know. I couldn't tell.

41:15.931 --> 41:19.643
Sweetheart, you'd make a lousy witness.
Now, let's get you back to bed.

41:19.727 --> 41:21.020
I'm not going to sleep.

41:21.103 --> 41:26.400
All right, you can read a book.
Come on. Let's go.

41:31.947 --> 41:33.824
You don't believe me, do you?

41:33.908 --> 41:37.203
It's not that I don't believe you,
sweetheart, it's just...

41:37.912 --> 41:39.997
There's only one way
in or out of that tower

41:40.080 --> 41:42.750
and that's through the house itself.
And we're alone here.

41:43.918 --> 41:47.046
But that tapping sound, I...
I need you to believe me.

41:47.129 --> 41:49.673
All right, look, let's try something.
Close your eyes.

41:51.008 --> 41:52.927
All right, they're closed. Now what?

41:53.761 --> 41:55.262
Just keep them closed.

42:01.310 --> 42:02.978
Keep them closed.

42:05.231 --> 42:06.690
Did it sound like this?

42:09.485 --> 42:12.696
Yes. That's exactly the sound.

42:13.572 --> 42:14.657
Look.

42:15.741 --> 42:18.077
It's one of Grace's old canes.

42:18.202 --> 42:19.912
It was hanging in the closet.

42:19.995 --> 42:21.997
And you know how drafty this house can be.

42:22.081 --> 42:23.457
It was hanging from the, hook,

42:23.541 --> 42:25.334
probably just swinging
and hitting the sides.

42:25.960 --> 42:27.336
I don't believe that.

42:28.420 --> 42:29.421
Suit yourself.

42:40.766 --> 42:42.351
Good morning, Mrs. Palmer.

42:42.434 --> 42:44.103
You set me up last night.

42:45.312 --> 42:46.623
I don't know what you're talking about.

42:46.647 --> 42:50.234
You talked me into wearing that necklace.
Her necklace!

42:50.317 --> 42:53.445
You knew how upset he would be.
You knew how he would react!

42:53.988 --> 42:56.949
As far as I know, the necklace
is just an old piece of jewelry.

42:57.491 --> 42:59.326
I didn't mean to cause you any trouble.

43:00.077 --> 43:02.288
The missus used to wear it
all the time with no problem.

43:02.371 --> 43:03.497
I'm sure.

43:06.917 --> 43:07.960
And what about this?

43:08.919 --> 43:10.296
Where did you get that?

43:10.713 --> 43:13.674
Richard. He found it
in the bedroom closet.

43:13.757 --> 43:16.343
He knew it was there, and so did you.

43:17.886 --> 43:19.930
Ms. Grace had several canes.

43:20.014 --> 43:22.474
Well, someone's been using it
around the house at night

43:22.558 --> 43:23.976
and I don't like it.

43:24.059 --> 43:25.644
You hear the cane?

43:28.606 --> 43:31.442
Every night since I've arrived.

43:31.525 --> 43:33.611
And I want it to stop.
Do you understand me?

43:33.694 --> 43:37.197
Of course, I do.
But I'm not here at night, remember?

43:43.203 --> 43:44.121
Hello?

43:44.204 --> 43:45.831
<i>Anna. This is Dr. Shaw.</i>

43:45.914 --> 43:47.082
Dr. Shaw?

43:47.166 --> 43:50.210
<i>Yes. I was just wondering
how you're getting on.</i>

43:50.294 --> 43:51.629
Yeah, I... I'm fine.

43:51.712 --> 43:52.713
Anna?

43:53.631 --> 43:54.632
<i>Hello?</i>

43:57.176 --> 44:01.639
Hi, sweetie. Listen, um, the church
is having its annual rummage sale today,

44:01.722 --> 44:04.892
and I thought, uh, maybe you'd like to go?

44:04.975 --> 44:07.186
Especially since I already
promised them we'd come.

44:07.269 --> 44:10.022
I'd love to get out
of the house for a while.

44:10.105 --> 44:12.816
Great! I'll get the car started
and all warmed up for you.

44:27.539 --> 44:29.124
Ah! Hi, good to see you.

44:33.796 --> 44:35.339
Sorry, Reverend.

44:35.422 --> 44:37.257
Ah, you like this one, huh?

44:37.341 --> 44:40.177
- I think it's cool, right?
- And don't forget that one, too.

44:43.013 --> 44:45.099
Hmm.

44:45.182 --> 44:46.975
Sales are brisk.

44:47.726 --> 44:49.186
You've done it again, Emma.

44:49.269 --> 44:50.854
Mmm, don't count your chickens yet.

44:53.816 --> 44:55.526
Look who just walked in.

44:56.276 --> 44:57.611
Here you go.

44:58.737 --> 45:01.448
Oh, first time he's been
to church in ages.

45:01.532 --> 45:05.369
I know. But remember,
you're not handing out sermons today.

45:05.452 --> 45:07.121
You're selling them.

45:08.580 --> 45:13.669
- Oh, it's the pastor.
- Anna, how nice you two could stop by.

45:13.752 --> 45:17.798
I have to apologize for last night.
I'm afraid I ruined everything.

45:17.881 --> 45:19.925
Oh, no. That's... It's all my fault.

45:20.008 --> 45:23.053
Let's not talk about last night.
It's all in the past.

45:23.137 --> 45:25.722
Let me show you around.
Maybe you'll see something you like.

45:26.181 --> 45:27.461
- Okay.
- You don't mind, do you?

45:27.516 --> 45:29.852
Uh, no. You go right ahead.
You two have fun.

45:39.862 --> 45:42.531
Hmm. Good to see you in church, Richard.

45:42.614 --> 45:45.159
Now, don't you start
in on me, Reverend.

45:45.242 --> 45:49.538
Oh, I wouldn't dream of it.
But thanks for coming, just the same.

45:49.621 --> 45:52.416
Well... So, what have you
got on tap this year?

45:53.500 --> 45:56.354
Let me show you the new fishing rods
that Jimmy's Sporting Goods donated.

45:56.378 --> 45:57.629
Love to see 'em.

46:00.507 --> 46:02.468
There are some lovely items here

46:02.551 --> 46:05.196
if you're looking to find something
to add a little color to your house.

46:05.220 --> 46:06.889
It sure needs it.

46:06.972 --> 46:09.057
Don't get me wrong, it's an amazing place,

46:09.141 --> 46:11.810
but it's a bit dreary,
if you know what I mean.

46:11.894 --> 46:14.563
I do. Those historical landmarks
can be pretty colorless.

46:15.147 --> 46:19.651
Well, have a look around,
see if anything catches your eye.

46:19.735 --> 46:22.988
Every dollar goes to a small
recreation program for the kids.

46:24.072 --> 46:26.450
Thank you. I'm sure I'll find something.

46:36.460 --> 46:39.546
This is a nice piece. Don't you think?

46:42.090 --> 46:44.092
I'm sorry. I forgot your name.

46:44.176 --> 46:45.594
Carrie.

46:46.720 --> 46:48.722
Carrie. That's right. From Sail Croft.

46:48.805 --> 46:51.099
Yeah. Cute, huh?

46:51.850 --> 46:55.562
It sure is. It's cheap, too.

46:55.646 --> 47:00.651
That's okay. I really don't have any place
to display it. But it is nice.

47:01.818 --> 47:05.572
Well, if you really don't want it,
maybe I'll get it.

47:05.656 --> 47:09.076
You should. It'd look great
on a bookcase somewhere.

47:09.159 --> 47:10.953
And you can't beat the price.

47:11.537 --> 47:12.871
I know just what to do with it.

47:13.372 --> 47:15.624
Very cool. Well, have fun.

47:15.707 --> 47:16.708
Thank you.

47:19.711 --> 47:22.005
- Huh?
- Okay, see you later.

47:24.341 --> 47:27.678
Hey, honey. Look at this rod and reel.
I'm thinking of buying it.

47:27.761 --> 47:29.596
You totally should.

47:29.680 --> 47:32.015
Let's get you out of that study
and keep you company.

47:32.099 --> 47:34.017
I never scared off a fish in my life.

47:36.812 --> 47:39.523
I wanna buy this. Isn't it darling?

47:40.524 --> 47:41.608
You can't buy that.

47:43.527 --> 47:45.654
What do you mean? It's only three dollars.

47:45.737 --> 47:48.031
Anna, that horse belonged to Grace.

47:48.115 --> 47:50.784
That's one of the items I donated
to the rummage sale.

47:50.909 --> 47:51.994
Oh.

47:52.077 --> 47:55.330
I don't want that in the house.
I got rid of those things for a reason.

47:55.414 --> 47:57.374
I'm sorry, honey. I... I didn't know.

47:57.457 --> 47:58.897
Look, if you want me to believe you,

47:58.959 --> 48:00.719
you're gonna have to stop
doing these things.

48:01.253 --> 48:02.879
You can't be mad at me.

48:03.380 --> 48:04.940
You're the one who gave Reverend Thomas

48:05.007 --> 48:06.800
the stuff for the rummage sale,
aren't you?

48:06.883 --> 48:08.260
Aren't you?

48:08.719 --> 48:10.929
Yes, but Mrs. Argyle was the one
that packed everything.

48:11.013 --> 48:13.223
- I didn't even know what was in there.
- All right.

48:13.473 --> 48:17.185
All right. Let's... Well, maybe
we should just go home now.

48:17.311 --> 48:20.230
It's almost noon and I have
a lot of work to do today.

48:20.314 --> 48:21.440
Are you ready?

48:23.233 --> 48:24.610
I... I guess so.

48:25.152 --> 48:26.695
Let's just... Let's just go.

48:38.707 --> 48:40.500
- Hi.
- Hi.

48:40.584 --> 48:43.295
- Can I help you?
- Is Richard at home?

48:44.713 --> 48:46.923
Yes. Come in.

48:51.678 --> 48:53.096
He's in his study right now,

48:53.180 --> 48:54.741
and he doesn't like to be bothered
while he's working,

48:54.765 --> 48:56.808
so maybe I could just tell him
what you wanted?

48:57.434 --> 48:59.978
Of course. You're Anna, right?

49:01.355 --> 49:04.066
I am. Have we met?

49:04.149 --> 49:06.735
Not yet. I'm Beth.

49:08.195 --> 49:10.405
I heard there was a new face
here in Shorecliff,

49:10.489 --> 49:13.158
and I, for one, am very glad.

49:13.241 --> 49:15.077
This place needs a breath of fresh air.

49:15.744 --> 49:16.745
Thank you.

49:17.245 --> 49:19.831
Just, uh, tell Rich I'm here.
He's expecting me.

49:20.582 --> 49:22.376
Okay. Just wait right here.

49:29.007 --> 49:31.593
Surprised to see you're still hanging
around here.

49:33.887 --> 49:35.305
Very surprised.

49:38.392 --> 49:41.019
Beth, I'm so glad you could make it today.

49:41.103 --> 49:43.188
I answer the call of my master's voice.

49:43.689 --> 49:45.190
Beth is my transcriber.

49:45.273 --> 49:47.651
She types up all those scribbled pages
I crank out

49:47.734 --> 49:49.629
and turns them into something
a publisher will buy.

49:49.653 --> 49:51.697
We've been a team for years now.

49:52.823 --> 49:55.033
Well, today is full of surprises.

49:55.742 --> 49:58.954
Let me help you set up.
We've got a lot to plough through today.

50:00.372 --> 50:01.957
It was nice meeting you.

50:02.040 --> 50:03.166
Same here.

50:13.593 --> 50:18.348
She certainly seems
to have recovered from last night.

50:18.432 --> 50:23.061
Well, don't count on it. She's as jumpy
as a cat, and it's only getting worse.

50:23.145 --> 50:25.313
You need to push her along
a little faster, Richard.

50:25.397 --> 50:28.817
But this has to be set up very carefully.

50:28.900 --> 50:30.318
I know.

50:32.028 --> 50:33.530
It has to be airtight.

50:34.030 --> 50:38.785
Oh, it will be. She's already convinced
someone's out to get her.

50:44.833 --> 50:46.752
You have to get rid of her, Richard...

50:52.591 --> 50:53.800
For good.

50:54.551 --> 50:56.553
No, I don't.

50:56.636 --> 50:59.514
Look, she's worth
two million dollars alive.

50:59.598 --> 51:02.934
All I have to do is to get them
to put her back in the hospital,

51:03.018 --> 51:04.770
and then, as her husband,

51:04.853 --> 51:07.230
I have complete control
of her bank account.

51:07.314 --> 51:09.065
When will that happen?

51:09.566 --> 51:11.777
Aw, we can't rush it, baby.

51:12.903 --> 51:14.571
She just got here, you know?

51:15.697 --> 51:16.698
Well...

51:20.744 --> 51:23.330
Don't try and double-cross me, Richard.

51:23.413 --> 51:24.790
That would be a very...

51:25.832 --> 51:27.250
bad idea.

51:28.376 --> 51:32.756
Remember, I actually do know
where the bodies are buried.

52:45.078 --> 52:47.163
Richard!

52:52.294 --> 52:55.714
Richard? Richard, I saw them.

52:57.340 --> 52:58.675
Richard!

53:38.840 --> 53:40.050
Anna!

53:40.634 --> 53:42.093
What's the matter with you?

53:42.594 --> 53:43.720
Oh, my God, Beth.

53:43.803 --> 53:46.514
Oh, my God, Beth, is right.
You look like you were about to jump.

53:47.682 --> 53:52.604
Don't... Don't say that.
I'm just a little dizzy.

53:52.687 --> 53:54.606
I thought I saw someone up here.

53:55.273 --> 53:57.651
You did. You saw me.

53:59.444 --> 54:00.862
You ready to go back down now?

54:02.572 --> 54:03.573
Yes.

54:05.283 --> 54:06.451
Come on, then.

54:19.631 --> 54:21.424
Richard said you were claustrophobic.

54:21.508 --> 54:23.428
So, what the hell
were you doing up in the tower?

54:24.302 --> 54:26.429
Well, the strangest things
keep happening around here

54:26.513 --> 54:29.099
and I thought that maybe
I could get to the bottom of it.

54:29.849 --> 54:32.644
Well, Richard got a call
and had to go into town.

54:32.727 --> 54:34.396
He needed to pick up some supplies.

54:34.771 --> 54:37.399
Whenever I need a break,
I go up to the tower platform.

54:38.066 --> 54:39.192
Did you know Grace?

54:41.653 --> 54:44.489
Uh, as well as anyone could, I guess.

54:45.448 --> 54:46.992
She never really talked to me much.

54:47.367 --> 54:48.785
Was she always blind?

54:49.869 --> 54:52.455
No. No, she wasn't.

54:54.165 --> 54:58.878
Uh, Grace suffered from hypertension
which brought on a bout of ischemia.

54:58.962 --> 55:02.132
It was all pretty sudden.
It cost her her eyesight.

55:03.299 --> 55:05.802
Richard must have loved her very much.

55:06.761 --> 55:09.597
Yeah. Yeah, he did.

55:10.849 --> 55:15.395
But, uh, people find a way
to move on, to love again.

55:18.314 --> 55:21.109
He's a complicated man.

55:21.985 --> 55:23.778
But he's been so patient with me.

55:23.862 --> 55:27.991
I mean, we barely know each other,
and I've been acting a little crazy.

55:30.243 --> 55:32.037
Let's not tell him about today.

55:32.704 --> 55:34.873
It'll be our little secret.

55:34.956 --> 55:36.207
Better not season the pot.

55:37.292 --> 55:38.501
I think you're right.

55:41.588 --> 55:43.882
That's Richard.
I should go help with the supplies.

55:43.965 --> 55:45.717
- I can do that.
- No, no, no. Um...

55:45.800 --> 55:47.218
That's what I get paid for.

55:47.302 --> 55:49.422
You wouldn't wanna make me
seem irrelevant, would you?

55:50.138 --> 55:52.265
I definitely need this job.

55:52.348 --> 55:53.558
Of course not.

56:21.169 --> 56:23.505
"Stepping out onto the cold,
metal platform,"

56:23.588 --> 56:27.592
she could feel a frigid shroud of darkness
wrap itself around her body.

56:27.675 --> 56:30.136
"As the cruel wind
whipped across her sightless eye..."

56:31.346 --> 56:32.722
Oh, my God.

56:35.308 --> 56:37.060
Anna, what are you doing in here?

56:38.019 --> 56:41.606
You're using your wife's death
as the subject of your story?

56:42.982 --> 56:44.275
This is awful!

56:44.359 --> 56:45.652
Anna, please.

57:05.421 --> 57:07.900
Dinner's ready. Would you like me
to take a plate to Mrs. Palmer?

57:07.924 --> 57:10.510
No, I'll do it.
I'm sorry about the extra work.

57:10.593 --> 57:12.137
Anna's not feeling well this evening.

57:12.887 --> 57:14.180
Will there be anything else?

57:14.264 --> 57:18.059
No. Just put my plate in the oven.
I'll have it later.

57:18.685 --> 57:19.686
Yes, sir.

57:27.193 --> 57:28.194
Oh, hey.

57:28.987 --> 57:31.114
Hey. Dinner in bed?

57:31.823 --> 57:32.949
A peace offering.

57:33.950 --> 57:37.495
You should've seen her today
at the top of the tower.

57:39.038 --> 57:40.457
She was at the top of the tower?

57:40.540 --> 57:43.084
She was almost ready
to fall over the edge.

57:43.835 --> 57:47.464
It would've been so easy.
Just a little push.

57:47.547 --> 57:49.674
Don't even think about it.

57:49.757 --> 57:51.968
I just need to have her
put away for a little while.

57:52.051 --> 57:54.929
As long as she's alive,
we have nothing to worry about.

57:55.638 --> 57:58.850
Don't look at me.
But it was awfully tempting.

57:59.767 --> 58:01.936
The crazier she acts, the better.

58:04.314 --> 58:05.773
Well, keep working on her.

58:06.900 --> 58:09.569
I will. I'll see you later?

58:10.862 --> 58:12.071
You can bet on it.

58:20.580 --> 58:22.624
Sweetie, I brought your dinner.

58:23.249 --> 58:24.542
I'm not hungry.

58:24.626 --> 58:26.586
Sweetie, you need to eat something.

58:28.213 --> 58:29.964
Richard, how could you?

58:30.048 --> 58:32.383
How could you use your wife's death
as part of your book?

58:32.467 --> 58:33.801
All right, look.

58:34.886 --> 58:38.765
I want you to go through this new draft
of my manuscript, all right?

58:38.848 --> 58:41.142
Now, nowhere in there
do I even remotely describe

58:41.226 --> 58:42.852
anything related to Grace's death.

58:42.936 --> 58:46.773
I know you're upset, but I don't know
what you're talking about.

58:46.856 --> 58:48.066
I know what I read.

58:48.149 --> 58:49.150
Then, show me.

58:53.363 --> 58:55.031
You must have just taken it out.

58:55.114 --> 58:56.115
I did not.

58:56.199 --> 58:59.244
And I am not gonna sit here
and have you accuse me of this.

58:59.327 --> 59:01.746
Frankly, I think your imagination's
gotten the better of you.

59:03.915 --> 59:05.166
I'll be right back.

59:16.719 --> 59:18.179
- Dr. Shaw?
- Yes.

59:18.263 --> 59:19.764
- Welcome.
- Are you Richard?

59:19.847 --> 59:21.182
Yes. Please come in.

59:21.474 --> 59:22.475
Mmm.

59:24.727 --> 59:25.979
This way, please.

59:30.108 --> 59:33.194
I really appreciate you coming out
on such short notice.

59:33.278 --> 59:34.696
And I know Anna will, too.

59:34.779 --> 59:37.615
I caught the afternoon ferry
right after we spoke.

59:38.616 --> 59:42.203
I tried to call her earlier, but I had
a little trouble getting through.

59:42.662 --> 59:45.790
Thank you.
You know, Anna means the world to me.

59:45.873 --> 59:49.252
I take it there has been
some sort of problem?

59:49.335 --> 59:51.462
Well, maybe.

59:52.797 --> 59:54.215
I'm not sure.

59:54.716 --> 59:58.845
She's been acting out of sorts
since she came to live here.

59:59.512 --> 01:00:01.192
And I really don't know how to explain it.

01:00:02.223 --> 01:00:03.224
Try.

01:00:03.933 --> 01:00:05.643
Okay. Um...

01:00:07.312 --> 01:00:10.648
I think she might be having
some sort of emotional breakdown.

01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:14.777
I was afraid of something like this.

01:00:15.570 --> 01:00:21.159
She's... Well, she imagines things.
She hears things.

01:00:21.909 --> 01:00:24.589
She's absolutely convinced there's someone
roaming around the house.

01:00:24.662 --> 01:00:28.041
Just today, she accused me
of some ridiculous crap

01:00:28.124 --> 01:00:31.669
that, frankly, has me questioning
her ability to think straight.

01:00:33.338 --> 01:00:36.549
How much has she told you
about her past issues?

01:00:37.091 --> 01:00:38.635
Well, not much.

01:00:40.553 --> 01:00:44.015
Um, I know her parents died
in a fire some years ago

01:00:44.098 --> 01:00:46.017
and that she was raised by the state.

01:00:47.268 --> 01:00:48.853
State hospital.

01:00:50.521 --> 01:00:52.315
Anything else?

01:00:53.149 --> 01:00:57.236
Well, I know she came into a bit of money
and she took a trip to the casino.

01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:58.613
That's where I first met her.

01:00:58.696 --> 01:01:01.407
And you got my number
from one of her prescription bottles?

01:01:01.491 --> 01:01:05.453
Yes. Now, look. I know I shouldn't have
been snooping around in her stuff,

01:01:05.536 --> 01:01:07.664
but I'm just really worried about her.

01:01:07.747 --> 01:01:11.584
Anna's parents died in a freak fire
when she was very young.

01:01:11.668 --> 01:01:13.252
No one was sure of how it happened,

01:01:13.336 --> 01:01:16.881
but the police were convinced that
Anna had somehow killed her parents.

01:01:18.424 --> 01:01:21.636
She was a minor, no real evidence.

01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:24.222
So charges were never filed.

01:01:24.597 --> 01:01:29.060
In the hospital,
she withdrew into a deep shell

01:01:29.143 --> 01:01:31.562
that I spent years
trying to pull her out of.

01:01:31.646 --> 01:01:32.730
When she turned 21,

01:01:32.814 --> 01:01:36.109
her trust fund kicked in
and the state released her.

01:01:37.151 --> 01:01:39.862
I was a little concerned when
I'd heard she was getting married.

01:01:39.946 --> 01:01:42.865
I wasn't really sure if she was ready
for anything like this.

01:01:42.949 --> 01:01:44.617
Well, maybe she's not.

01:01:46.577 --> 01:01:47.787
Can I see her now?

01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:49.997
Sure. I'll ask her to come down.

01:01:57.422 --> 01:02:00.383
Someone to see you.
It's a surprise.

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:21.070
Anna, look who's come to see you.

01:02:22.989 --> 01:02:24.198
Dr. Shaw?

01:02:24.282 --> 01:02:25.575
Good evening, Anna.

01:02:27.118 --> 01:02:28.578
What is he doing here?

01:02:29.912 --> 01:02:31.789
I came to see how you're doing.

01:02:33.541 --> 01:02:34.959
Would you like to sit down?

01:02:42.258 --> 01:02:44.010
Can we have a few minutes alone?

01:02:44.093 --> 01:02:45.511
Of course.

01:02:51.225 --> 01:02:53.603
You don't look very happy to see me.

01:02:55.229 --> 01:02:56.522
Richard called you?

01:02:56.606 --> 01:02:57.607
He did.

01:02:59.567 --> 01:03:00.985
What did he tell you?

01:03:01.068 --> 01:03:02.320
Not much.

01:03:03.738 --> 01:03:05.323
He's just worried about you.

01:03:06.449 --> 01:03:07.617
I am, too.

01:03:09.327 --> 01:03:12.997
So, Anna, tell me what's going on.

01:03:18.669 --> 01:03:22.715
Someone doesn't want me in this house.
Someone wants me gone.

01:03:24.509 --> 01:03:25.843
Why do you say that?

01:03:25.927 --> 01:03:29.180
I know it sounds crazy, but someone's
trying to drive me out of here.

01:03:29.263 --> 01:03:31.182
But who would do that?

01:03:32.558 --> 01:03:34.852
Ah... I don't know.

01:03:34.936 --> 01:03:39.065
Maybe, maybe the housekeeper,
Mrs. Argyle.

01:03:39.148 --> 01:03:44.487
She was devoted to Richard's former wife
and she hates me.

01:03:45.404 --> 01:03:47.240
Do you want me to talk to her?

01:03:47.323 --> 01:03:51.661
No, she's never here at night,
which would make it perfect,

01:03:51.744 --> 01:03:54.455
because she's never here
when these things are happening.

01:03:54.539 --> 01:03:56.290
You might be right.

01:03:57.375 --> 01:04:01.128
What about your husband?
Where is he when all this is going on?

01:04:03.464 --> 01:04:06.425
He's never around, either.

01:04:18.145 --> 01:04:19.230
Well?

01:04:19.313 --> 01:04:21.148
You were right to call me.

01:04:21.232 --> 01:04:22.316
What's wrong?

01:04:23.025 --> 01:04:25.778
Anna's in a very fragile state right now.

01:04:25.862 --> 01:04:29.949
Her imagination seems to be hyperactive,
maybe even to a dangerous level.

01:04:30.533 --> 01:04:32.451
Why... Why dangerous?

01:04:32.535 --> 01:04:36.706
Nobody's really sure whether Anna
deliberately killed her parents or not,

01:04:36.789 --> 01:04:39.542
but it did have a profound effect on her.

01:04:39.625 --> 01:04:42.336
That, coupled with the fact
that she inherited a small fortune

01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:44.088
as a result of their tragedy,

01:04:44.672 --> 01:04:46.507
makes her feel even more guilty.

01:04:47.675 --> 01:04:50.845
When you met her, she was
on an uncontrolled downward spiral.

01:04:52.847 --> 01:04:55.892
I was very nervous when she told me
she was getting married.

01:04:55.975 --> 01:04:58.185
And her problems seemed
to have followed her here.

01:04:58.269 --> 01:05:00.271
That's a lot to suppose.

01:05:01.105 --> 01:05:03.399
I don't have any other explanation for it.

01:05:03.482 --> 01:05:06.569
Unless there really is someone here
who's trying to frighten her.

01:05:06.652 --> 01:05:09.947
Well, I think I would know.
So, now what?

01:05:10.781 --> 01:05:13.159
Have her get these filled tomorrow.

01:05:14.368 --> 01:05:16.621
I can't promise
they'll solve her problems,

01:05:16.704 --> 01:05:18.539
but they might help her calm down a bit.

01:05:18.623 --> 01:05:19.975
Just be careful how she uses them.

01:05:19.999 --> 01:05:21.918
And what if these don't help?

01:05:22.752 --> 01:05:24.295
I don't wanna guess.

01:05:24.378 --> 01:05:26.339
But if they don't,
she'll have to come back

01:05:26.422 --> 01:05:29.216
to the mainland for a while
where I can watch her more closely.

01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:32.595
We don't want these delusions
to turn in to something more serious.

01:05:32.678 --> 01:05:34.764
All right.
Well, I'll get these filled for her.

01:05:34.847 --> 01:05:39.143
No, she's gonna have to show up in person
to get those scripts filled.

01:05:39.226 --> 01:05:41.145
They're controlled substances.

01:05:41.228 --> 01:05:43.230
All right, Doctor, thank you.

01:05:43.314 --> 01:05:47.026
And I hope you're wrong
about her trying to hurt herself.

01:05:48.402 --> 01:05:49.862
Just keep a close eye on her.

01:05:50.738 --> 01:05:55.076
And whatever you do,
don't leave her alone for too long.

01:05:55.159 --> 01:05:58.371
Oh, don't worry.
I won't leave her alone for a minute.

01:06:01.582 --> 01:06:03.960
Honey, I'm sorry.
I've got to leave the island for a day.

01:06:04.043 --> 01:06:05.544
But I'll be back tomorrow.

01:06:05.628 --> 01:06:06.629
What?

01:06:07.421 --> 01:06:08.339
I've got to go.

01:06:08.422 --> 01:06:11.759
There's a publisher's meeting that
suddenly came up and I've got to be there.

01:06:11.842 --> 01:06:13.302
It's very important.

01:06:14.345 --> 01:06:16.472
Is this about the check that didn't come?

01:06:17.223 --> 01:06:20.726
Uh, that, and the fact
that I've missed my deadline.

01:06:21.978 --> 01:06:25.022
But you don't need to worry about that.
Everything will be fine.

01:06:26.691 --> 01:06:28.109
This is all my fault.

01:06:29.610 --> 01:06:32.321
How can it be your fault?
There isn't a problem.

01:06:32.405 --> 01:06:36.826
Really. Now, Dr. Shaw said
you have to get these filled yourself.

01:06:37.493 --> 01:06:38.494
Oh.

01:06:39.286 --> 01:06:42.039
Look, why don't you drop me off in town,

01:06:42.123 --> 01:06:45.203
and then you can do a little shopping
while you get your prescriptions filled?

01:06:46.502 --> 01:06:48.045
Whatever you say.

01:06:48.129 --> 01:06:51.007
Great. I'll call you tomorrow
and let you know what time to pick me up.

01:06:51.090 --> 01:06:52.133
I'll go grab your coat.

01:07:19.785 --> 01:07:21.954
The pharmacy's just
one block up that way.

01:07:22.038 --> 01:07:23.306
You won't have any trouble finding it.

01:07:23.330 --> 01:07:24.665
I'm sure I won't.

01:07:26.125 --> 01:07:27.376
I'll call you tomorrow?

01:07:28.169 --> 01:07:30.296
Richard, please hurry back.

01:07:30.379 --> 01:07:32.983
I really don't like the idea of staying
in that house all by myself.

01:07:33.007 --> 01:07:36.385
I will. Maybe you can convince
Mrs. Argyle to stay over tonight.

01:07:36.469 --> 01:07:37.595
She's done it before.

01:07:38.262 --> 01:07:40.264
No. I'll see you tomorrow?

01:07:40.347 --> 01:07:41.515
Okay. Bye, babe.

01:07:54.945 --> 01:07:56.989
- Afternoon.
- Afternoon.

01:07:57.073 --> 01:07:59.033
- Are we running on time today?
- We are.

01:07:59.116 --> 01:08:00.785
Good. I'm in a bit of a hurry.

01:08:03.079 --> 01:08:04.663
I'll bet you are.

01:08:24.225 --> 01:08:25.309
Seriously?

01:08:37.404 --> 01:08:39.865
Hey. You having car trouble?

01:08:40.698 --> 01:08:44.036
Yeah. The damn thing won't start.

01:08:45.746 --> 01:08:47.432
Well, what's wrong with it?
Do you need a jump?

01:08:47.456 --> 01:08:51.042
Well, Richard said that it needed
a new part and he ordered it,

01:08:51.127 --> 01:08:53.921
but I guess it never got fixed.

01:08:54.712 --> 01:08:57.675
Bummer. Maybe you oughta give him a call.

01:08:58.341 --> 01:09:01.261
He went to the mainland
and he's not gonna be back until tomorrow.

01:09:02.095 --> 01:09:03.471
Double bummer.

01:09:03.555 --> 01:09:04.807
Yeah.

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:07.393
Well, hey, I just got done
with lunch shift

01:09:07.475 --> 01:09:09.562
and I am not doing anything special.

01:09:09.645 --> 01:09:10.979
Why don't I give you a ride home?

01:09:11.063 --> 01:09:13.274
Oh, I... I couldn't ask you to do that.

01:09:14.233 --> 01:09:17.903
Why not? I've always wanted
to see the inside of the lighthouse.

01:09:17.987 --> 01:09:19.446
What better time?

01:09:20.781 --> 01:09:22.116
I... I don't know.

01:09:22.198 --> 01:09:24.952
Come on. I'm parked in the back lot.

01:09:25.911 --> 01:09:29.790
Okay, but pay no mind to the housekeeper.

01:09:29.874 --> 01:09:31.417
She's a real piece of work.

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:33.627
I heard she rides around on a broom.

01:09:43.179 --> 01:09:45.514
This place is even cooler than I imagined.

01:09:45.598 --> 01:09:48.975
That's what I thought
when I first got here, too.

01:09:49.768 --> 01:09:51.395
Not so much anymore?

01:09:53.022 --> 01:09:57.151
There's something that's just
not quite right about this place.

01:09:57.234 --> 01:09:59.737
I can't explain it without sounding crazy.

01:10:00.321 --> 01:10:02.114
That's what Grace said.

01:10:02.615 --> 01:10:03.908
You knew Grace?

01:10:04.408 --> 01:10:07.995
No, I just heard a few things.

01:10:08.829 --> 01:10:10.164
What did you hear?

01:10:12.541 --> 01:10:13.542
Well...

01:10:18.339 --> 01:10:21.508
Just that she complained
about hearing things in the night.

01:10:21.967 --> 01:10:23.177
Who knows?

01:10:27.181 --> 01:10:28.766
I wish Richard was here.

01:10:29.558 --> 01:10:31.727
He was away the night Grace died, too.

01:10:34.563 --> 01:10:35.981
So I heard.

01:10:43.948 --> 01:10:46.450
Thanks for the ride home and the company.

01:10:47.159 --> 01:10:50.287
I wish I could stay longer,
but I have a date tonight.

01:10:50.746 --> 01:10:51.872
Lucky you.

01:10:51.956 --> 01:10:53.374
You're gonna be all right?

01:10:54.124 --> 01:10:56.085
Yeah, I'll be fine. Don't worry about me.

01:10:56.168 --> 01:10:57.753
What are you gonna do about your car?

01:10:57.836 --> 01:11:00.714
You know, I think I'm just gonna
wait until Richard gets back.

01:11:00.798 --> 01:11:02.424
Maybe it'll start for him.

01:11:02.508 --> 01:11:05.844
All right. Well, if you need
anything, call me.

01:11:05.970 --> 01:11:07.346
You've got my number.

01:11:07.972 --> 01:11:08.973
Thank you.

01:11:09.056 --> 01:11:10.057
Goodnight.

01:11:25.406 --> 01:11:26.865
Supper's on the table.

01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:31.370
You're leaving already?
It's not even 7:00.

01:11:31.453 --> 01:11:35.207
I have some shopping to do for tomorrow.
I'll clean up in the morning.

01:11:35.291 --> 01:11:37.376
Of course. Thank you.

01:11:37.459 --> 01:11:39.086
Why don't you leave?

01:11:39.837 --> 01:11:42.256
Why would I leave? This is my home.

01:11:42.339 --> 01:11:45.050
Just for tonight. Stay at the hotel.

01:11:45.134 --> 01:11:46.719
I'll be fine, Mrs. Argyle.

01:11:47.678 --> 01:11:49.513
I'll lock the door behind me.

01:13:44.878 --> 01:13:46.338
Oh, my God.

01:13:46.422 --> 01:13:49.049
Honey, I'm home.

01:13:50.843 --> 01:13:51.844
What are...

01:13:51.927 --> 01:13:54.513
What are you doing here?
Why do you have that cane?

01:13:54.596 --> 01:13:57.391
You always ask so many questions.

01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:01.061
Well, you know, I'd completely forgotten.

01:14:01.145 --> 01:14:05.315
I have some very important
unfinished business to take care of here,

01:14:05.441 --> 01:14:06.692
with you.

01:14:06.775 --> 01:14:08.318
Don't you come near me.

01:14:09.361 --> 01:14:13.073
You know, Anna, this house,
it never really suited you.

01:14:13.157 --> 01:14:15.701
Too many strange things going on.

01:14:15.784 --> 01:14:19.538
Things that filled your head
with all kinds of weird ideas.

01:14:19.621 --> 01:14:23.167
It's no wonder your doctor thought
that you might try to hurt yourself.

01:14:23.250 --> 01:14:25.627
Now, I didn't believe him, of course.

01:14:26.962 --> 01:14:29.465
But now, I can see that I was wrong.

01:14:30.966 --> 01:14:31.967
Stay back.

01:14:32.050 --> 01:14:34.595
Beth said she saw you
on the tower platform the other night.

01:14:34.678 --> 01:14:36.805
It looked like you might be going to jump.

01:14:36.889 --> 01:14:40.392
If only she had helped
you out just a little,

01:14:40.476 --> 01:14:42.519
you wouldn't have to be
going through any of this.

01:14:43.187 --> 01:14:45.272
What do you want from me? My money?

01:14:45.355 --> 01:14:46.541
You can have it.
You can have it all!

01:14:46.565 --> 01:14:49.401
I know, and I need it desperately.

01:14:49.485 --> 01:14:51.069
And I've got plans for it, too.

01:14:51.153 --> 01:14:52.654
They just don't include you.

01:14:52.738 --> 01:14:55.365
Get off me!

01:14:55.449 --> 01:14:56.449
No!

01:14:57.951 --> 01:14:58.994
Richard, let go!

01:14:59.077 --> 01:15:00.662
Anna!

01:15:04.708 --> 01:15:06.710
Anna! Damn it!

01:15:08.045 --> 01:15:10.506
Help! Help, please.

01:15:12.841 --> 01:15:15.010
Say goodnight.

01:15:18.639 --> 01:15:21.099
Let's go inside, sweetie.

01:15:22.267 --> 01:15:26.438
So, let's see how the tower
agrees with you.

01:15:26.522 --> 01:15:29.566
And if you need anything, just scream.

01:15:53.048 --> 01:15:57.844
Richard, let me out!
Please! Let me out!

01:15:58.762 --> 01:16:01.765
Goodnight, Anna.
I'll be back before morning.

01:16:02.975 --> 01:16:07.688
Let me out of here!

01:16:07.771 --> 01:16:10.732
Let me out, please...

01:16:25.831 --> 01:16:27.749
Oh, damn.

01:16:34.006 --> 01:16:36.133
<i>Hey, it's Anna. Leave a message.</i>

01:16:36.883 --> 01:16:41.305
Double damn. I wonder if she needs these.

01:16:49.688 --> 01:16:53.108
I'll bet by morning,
she'll have completely lost her mind.

01:16:53.191 --> 01:16:54.711
You know, it's almost a shame, really.

01:16:54.776 --> 01:16:56.737
Don't feel bad for her.

01:16:56.820 --> 01:16:59.448
She belongs in a hospital.
You're doing her a favor.

01:16:59.531 --> 01:17:01.658
You know, you're right.

01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:00.300
Mrs. Palmer?

01:18:07.015 --> 01:18:10.894
Mrs. Palmer?
Mrs. Palmer, are you in there?

01:18:25.826 --> 01:18:27.452
What the hell was that?

01:18:27.536 --> 01:18:32.207
It's Anna. She must've gotten out.
She's lost her mind.

01:18:32.290 --> 01:18:35.252
Yeah, she has lost her mind.

01:18:35.335 --> 01:18:37.003
Why don't you go do something about it?

01:18:37.087 --> 01:18:39.089
Oh, all right. You wait here.

01:18:48.181 --> 01:18:50.934
Argyle? What is she doing here?

01:18:53.103 --> 01:18:54.104
She's alive.

01:18:55.939 --> 01:18:57.107
Anna?

01:18:59.735 --> 01:19:00.986
Anna?

01:19:14.374 --> 01:19:15.751
Anna?

01:19:19.463 --> 01:19:20.797
Sweetie?

01:19:22.257 --> 01:19:23.633
Anna?

01:19:24.926 --> 01:19:26.386
Anna?

01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:28.096
Sweetie?

01:19:28.722 --> 01:19:30.724
I know you need help.

01:19:31.516 --> 01:19:33.560
Come on out and I'll help you.

01:19:33.643 --> 01:19:34.853
Honey?

01:19:35.896 --> 01:19:37.355
Where are you, sweetheart?

01:20:30.909 --> 01:20:33.036
Die!

01:20:38.041 --> 01:20:40.752
Oh, my God! Anna! Stop!

01:20:50.554 --> 01:20:52.138
Oh, my God.

01:20:59.354 --> 01:21:01.940
Argyle. Argyle...

01:21:03.149 --> 01:21:06.820
Oh, my God, you're okay.
It's gonna be okay.

01:21:53.366 --> 01:21:57.537
I waited a long time
for Richard to slip up.

01:21:57.621 --> 01:21:59.873
I knew he killed Grace.

01:22:02.250 --> 01:22:05.003
She'd told me of her suspicions.

01:22:05.670 --> 01:22:08.548
I wanted to prove he murdered her.

01:22:08.798 --> 01:22:12.260
But all I could do was wait and watch.

01:22:13.345 --> 01:22:14.721
But how did you know?

01:22:16.181 --> 01:22:20.518
When he left on the ferry today,
just like he did the night Grace died,

01:22:20.602 --> 01:22:23.772
I thought he might come back tonight
and try and kill Anna.

01:22:25.273 --> 01:22:27.442
Thank God you came back when you did.

01:22:28.526 --> 01:22:34.115
The night Grace died,
I suspected that he returned,

01:22:34.199 --> 01:22:37.869
renting a boat to build an alibi.
It was just a feeling, but...

01:22:41.748 --> 01:22:42.958
And that woman in the yard?

01:22:43.041 --> 01:22:44.876
Beth? Oh, she was part of this.

01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:49.130
I think she was blackmailing him
over Miss Grace's death.

01:22:50.173 --> 01:22:51.174
So, now what?

01:22:53.468 --> 01:22:56.012
Now, I have a lot of explaining to do.

01:22:56.930 --> 01:22:58.598
But one thing is for certain.

01:23:00.350 --> 01:23:01.935
He got what he deserved.

01:23:02.978 --> 01:23:04.187
Poor Anna.

01:23:05.647 --> 01:23:07.107
She'll get the help she needs.

01:23:10.318 --> 01:23:11.653
I hope you're right.

01:23:29.462 --> 01:23:30.880
Dr. Shaw?

01:23:32.674 --> 01:23:34.426
She's asking for you again.

01:23:35.635 --> 01:23:37.095
I can't see her today.

01:23:37.762 --> 01:23:39.222
Can't? Why not?

01:23:40.557 --> 01:23:43.977
She's in a terrible state right now,
but she will get better.

01:23:45.228 --> 01:23:48.106
Sometimes,
I feel my presence isn't helping things.

01:23:48.189 --> 01:23:50.400
She needs a new doctor,
someone she doesn't know.

01:23:51.443 --> 01:23:53.778
The only thing that seems
to calm her down is...

01:23:53.862 --> 01:23:56.865
Is this ceramic horse. Can she have it?

01:23:57.991 --> 01:23:59.826
Well, she shouldn't, but...

01:24:01.536 --> 01:24:04.664
If she's struggling today,
I don't see the harm.

01:24:06.082 --> 01:24:07.250
Thank you.

01:24:21.056 --> 01:24:22.098
Anna.

01:24:26.352 --> 01:24:27.812
I brought your horse.

01:24:31.775 --> 01:24:33.026
Thank you.

01:24:40.909 --> 01:24:43.912
You seem... afraid.

01:24:46.456 --> 01:24:48.124
Why are you afraid?

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.294
There's no reason to be afraid.

01:24:52.170 --> 01:24:53.880
Especially, not with me.

01:24:59.511 --> 01:25:03.014
Why, I wouldn't hurt a fly.
