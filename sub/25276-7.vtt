WEBVTT

00:00.209 --> 00:02.100
What's up, Mar-freakials?

00:02.101 --> 00:04.799
Today we're talking
about the rites of passage.

00:04.800 --> 00:06.891
See, most people in
those moments run scared.

00:06.892 --> 00:07.859
But not me.

00:07.860 --> 00:09.194
First kiss.

00:09.195 --> 00:11.062
Most people are
all timid and kiss like,

00:11.063 --> 00:12.363
[smacks lips]

00:12.364 --> 00:14.632
I was busting slobs like,
"Come here..."

00:14.633 --> 00:17.268
[moans]

00:17.269 --> 00:20.138
But the biggest rite of passage is...

00:20.139 --> 00:22.874
Bam! License to drive.

00:22.875 --> 00:25.343
See, most people were nervous. Not me.

00:25.344 --> 00:27.912
I did donuts outside of Dunkin Donuts

00:27.913 --> 00:29.781
in front of a cop
that was eating donuts.

00:29.782 --> 00:33.585
'Cause I'm fearless. [chomps]

00:46.232 --> 00:48.766
[sighs] How does this happen?

00:48.767 --> 00:53.238
Why does God let bad things
happen to good people?

00:53.239 --> 00:54.939
Yvette.

00:54.940 --> 00:58.009
There are worse things than
having a low passenger rating

00:58.010 --> 01:00.945
on Uber.

01:00.946 --> 01:02.580
That's easy for you to say.

01:02.581 --> 01:04.748
You're a seven with a 4.8.

01:04.750 --> 01:08.820
And I'm a ten with a 2.2.

01:08.821 --> 01:13.191
Well, this seven is starting
to give 0.0 damns.

01:13.192 --> 01:17.362
[panting]

01:17.363 --> 01:19.464
Hi, Ash.

01:19.465 --> 01:22.166
Hi, Geico lizard.

01:22.167 --> 01:25.069
Marlon, why are you running
like Maury just said,

01:25.070 --> 01:29.107
"You are the father"?

01:29.108 --> 01:31.009
He hopped the fence and
sprinted through the backyard

01:31.010 --> 01:34.279
because the neighbors were
playing with their dog outside.

01:34.280 --> 01:36.414
He's a killer. I know it.

01:36.415 --> 01:39.784
His name is Twinkie.

01:39.785 --> 01:41.352
So? Back in the projects

01:41.353 --> 01:44.222
some dogs had nice names too,
like Tiny, and Princess,

01:44.223 --> 01:46.524
and Lamb Chop, but they were vicious.

01:46.525 --> 01:50.361
And some of them was on crack.

01:50.362 --> 01:52.030
You ever been chased up
a chain-link fence

01:52.031 --> 01:55.366
by a Cracker Spaniel?

01:55.367 --> 01:58.236
Stevie, what's your passenger
rating on Uber?

01:58.237 --> 01:59.737
[chuckles] I'm proud to say

01:59.738 --> 02:02.807
I have an unblemished 5.0.

02:02.808 --> 02:07.277
Will somebody please tell me
what's wrong with me?

02:09.646 --> 02:12.083
Oh, too many options.

02:12.084 --> 02:15.486
Oh, damn, I got insult brain freeze.

02:15.487 --> 02:17.055
No, but seriously.

02:17.056 --> 02:19.324
Who wouldn't wanna pick me up?

02:19.325 --> 02:21.259
Oh, my God, woman.

02:21.260 --> 02:24.395
Are you trying to kill me or what?

02:24.396 --> 02:27.565
Anyway, I have to take Marley
and her friend Kristie

02:27.566 --> 02:28.966
to the Art Walk downtown.

02:28.967 --> 02:31.002
I need you to take Zack
to his sleepover.

02:31.003 --> 02:32.003
No can do.

02:32.004 --> 02:33.271
Ah, see, me and Stevie,

02:33.272 --> 02:35.006
we're going to a one-night showing

02:35.007 --> 02:38.209
of the classic "Breakin' 2:
Electric Boogaloo."

02:38.210 --> 02:39.510
Ha-ha!

02:39.511 --> 02:41.713
Heh-hey. Ah-ooh.

02:41.714 --> 02:44.649
The 23rd best breakdancing
movie of all time.

02:44.650 --> 02:48.119
[chuckles] We just came
to get some snacks.

02:48.120 --> 02:50.054
And why are you driving
Marley anywhere?

02:50.055 --> 02:51.422
She is 16 years old.

02:51.423 --> 02:52.957
She should have her license by now.

02:52.958 --> 02:55.593
Well, she has her permit,
but she's just not interested

02:55.594 --> 02:57.195
in getting behind the wheel yet.

02:57.196 --> 02:58.563
Oh, my God, girl, she's 16.

02:58.564 --> 03:00.098
What, you gonna be sexting
for her next?

03:00.099 --> 03:02.333
What the hell?

03:02.334 --> 03:03.735
You know, Marley's not alone.

03:03.736 --> 03:05.670
Her generation feels
less urgency to drive.

03:05.671 --> 03:09.640
They don't crave independence
the way we did.

03:09.641 --> 03:13.743
Says the negro on my couch.

03:14.212 --> 03:16.114
Man, I couldn't wait to drive.

03:16.115 --> 03:17.648
The day I turned 16,

03:17.649 --> 03:20.351
I grabbed my uncle's
tricked-out school bus,

03:20.352 --> 03:23.354
I went down to the DMV,
I got my license,

03:23.355 --> 03:26.157
and that meant that me
and 37 of my homeboys

03:26.158 --> 03:29.427
could go anywhere we wanted.

03:29.428 --> 03:31.496
I'll never forget
the first time I drove.

03:31.497 --> 03:34.298
I sat on Nana's lap
and steered her big old Buick

03:34.299 --> 03:37.869
through the empty A&P parking lot.

03:37.870 --> 03:39.003
You told me you learned to drive

03:39.004 --> 03:40.772
when you was 19 years old.

03:40.773 --> 03:44.741
Yeah, I was.

03:45.643 --> 03:49.447
Okay?

03:49.448 --> 03:53.351
Well, Marley will come around
to driving in her own time.

03:53.352 --> 03:54.986
Come on, Ashley.

03:54.987 --> 03:56.320
She should have her license by now.

03:56.321 --> 03:58.189
She should be driving
herself to school.

03:58.190 --> 04:00.558
She should be dropping her
brother off at sleepovers.

04:00.559 --> 04:02.727
She should be picking
her daddy up from clubs

04:02.728 --> 04:05.396
when he's too drunk to drive home.

04:05.397 --> 04:07.765
Marley, it's time
you get your license.

04:07.766 --> 04:09.534
Tomorrow, in the car with Daddy,

04:09.535 --> 04:11.035
lessons begin.

04:11.036 --> 04:13.404
Why do I need to drive?
I have Mommy and Uber.

04:13.405 --> 04:16.339
Yeah, Marlon, I don't mind
driving her around.

04:16.341 --> 04:19.577
Why don't we get you a little
black hat and a slave accent

04:19.577 --> 04:23.781
and you two can play
Driving Miss Marley?

04:23.782 --> 04:25.516
All right, forget it, Marley.

04:25.517 --> 04:27.218
Clearly, your dad
is not gonna let this go.

04:27.219 --> 04:28.586
Nope.

04:28.587 --> 04:30.621
Tomorrow I'm gonna
make you a road warrior.

04:30.622 --> 04:33.558
But for now, me and Stevie got a date

04:33.559 --> 04:35.760
with Turbo, Kelly, and Ozone.

04:35.761 --> 04:37.462
Let's get it, boy. Bang, bang.

04:37.463 --> 04:39.263
Oh, oh, oh.

04:39.264 --> 04:42.400
'Ey, pull the car around back,

04:42.401 --> 04:44.402
kiss it up against the garage,

04:44.403 --> 04:47.171
I'ma jump right in, okay?

04:47.172 --> 04:50.074
Not today, Twinkie.

04:51.604 --> 04:53.275
- [car dings]
- What is that noise?

04:53.276 --> 04:54.743
[mimics dinging]

04:54.744 --> 04:56.945
Put your seatbelt on.

04:56.946 --> 04:58.736
Oh, yeah.

04:58.737 --> 05:01.639
All right, baby girl,
now what's the first thing

05:01.640 --> 05:03.340
you do when you get in a car?

05:03.341 --> 05:04.708
Check if there's enough gas.

05:04.709 --> 05:05.676
Eh! No.

05:05.677 --> 05:07.912
First thing you do
when you get in a car

05:07.913 --> 05:09.547
is I want you to get your lean on.

05:09.548 --> 05:12.883
Lean all the way back.
Yeah, now I'm feeling myself.

05:12.884 --> 05:14.685
Yeah.

05:14.686 --> 05:16.120
- Marlon.
- Huh?

05:16.121 --> 05:18.789
Please don't teach my baby
all your nonsense.

05:18.790 --> 05:21.425
Who told you to come along on
our driving lesson anyway?

05:21.426 --> 05:23.928
I'm not letting her learn
to drive from somebody

05:23.929 --> 05:26.597
who was taught in
a school bus in Manhattan

05:26.598 --> 05:27.898
by their drunk uncle.

05:27.899 --> 05:32.002
He wasn't drunk. He was high.

05:32.003 --> 05:33.837
Daddy, your hand should be
at ten and two.

05:33.838 --> 05:36.974
Baby girl, no, your hands
should not be at ten and two.

05:36.975 --> 05:39.643
Look at that.
Ten and two is not swaggy.

05:39.644 --> 05:43.247
I like to fast-forward
my hands to, like, high noon.

05:43.248 --> 05:45.149
Yeah, this way you got one hand free,

05:45.150 --> 05:47.017
and you could chuck
a handful of pennies

05:47.018 --> 05:48.886
at somebody that's
trying to cut you off.

05:48.887 --> 05:50.654
Like, [groans].

05:50.655 --> 05:53.591
- Marlon.
- What?

05:53.592 --> 05:57.995
Girl, nothing feels better
than shotgunning $1.62

05:57.996 --> 06:00.464
at somebody that try to sideswipe you.

06:00.465 --> 06:02.866
Uh, pa-ra-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka!

06:02.867 --> 06:03.934
Ha-ha.

06:03.935 --> 06:08.405
And, you get to help
the homeless at the same time.

06:08.406 --> 06:09.740
Another lesson.

06:09.741 --> 06:11.842
Learning when to use
the horn is important.

06:11.843 --> 06:13.944
You don't just honk for no reason.

06:13.945 --> 06:16.246
Sometimes you honk because you
wanna let somebody over.

06:16.247 --> 06:17.648
[honks twice]

06:17.649 --> 06:18.983
Then they honk back. You know, oh,

06:18.984 --> 06:21.185
he give me a nice t... tip of the hat.

06:21.186 --> 06:23.187
And then sometimes, there's
somebody you're ignoring

06:23.188 --> 06:24.888
trying to cut you off,
and you're like, I see you.

06:24.889 --> 06:27.091
I see you... no, no. [honks]

06:27.092 --> 06:28.792
[honks] Uh-uh.

06:28.793 --> 06:31.595
You want some attitude. Just warn 'em.

06:31.596 --> 06:34.932
And then sometimes, some idiot
actually try to cut you off,

06:34.933 --> 06:37.234
and that's when you gotta
curse 'em out with your horn.

06:37.235 --> 06:40.037
Ah, no, you didn't. [honking]

06:40.038 --> 06:41.338
Jackass!

06:41.339 --> 06:43.374
[honks twice] You hear that?

06:43.375 --> 06:44.808
It curses for you.

06:44.809 --> 06:46.243
[honks twice]

06:46.244 --> 06:49.046
[honks three times]

06:49.047 --> 06:51.548
Yeah?

06:51.549 --> 06:54.184
Uh-oh.

06:54.185 --> 06:55.519
Daddy, you just made an illegal left.

06:55.520 --> 06:57.454
You can't cross a double yellow line.

06:57.455 --> 07:01.492
Listen, remember, it's only
illegal if you get caught.

07:01.493 --> 07:04.028
All right, you ready
to rock this, baby girl?

07:04.029 --> 07:05.929
I think I've learned enough for today.

07:05.930 --> 07:08.599
Yes, Marlon, how about you drop us off

07:08.600 --> 07:11.301
and Marley and I will
go get mani-pedis.

07:11.302 --> 07:13.837
Mani-pedis? We just got here.

07:13.838 --> 07:16.507
I gotta teach Marley
the rules of the road.

07:16.508 --> 07:18.976
Well, I know one rule is that
you have to stay at least

07:18.977 --> 07:21.278
three car lengths behind
the car in front of you.

07:21.279 --> 07:24.081
Tsk. Girl, that's for people
who don't have auto-brakes.

07:24.082 --> 07:28.417
[tires screech] Oh!

07:29.453 --> 07:31.021
See?

07:31.022 --> 07:33.190
Technology got you covered.

07:33.191 --> 07:35.893
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

07:35.894 --> 07:39.163
Okay. Stevie,
I have to get my score up.

07:39.164 --> 07:40.597
Now, just pay attention and tell me

07:40.598 --> 07:41.932
if I'm doing anything wrong.

07:41.933 --> 07:43.734
I'm just glad that
you asked me to help.

07:43.735 --> 07:44.868
It's so nice to be
able to spend time...

07:44.869 --> 07:47.304
Hey, driver, couple of things.

07:47.305 --> 07:49.640
Now, I know y'all like
to follow your Waze,

07:49.641 --> 07:51.175
but I'ma take you my ways.

07:51.176 --> 07:54.812
Also, set your A/C at 72
degrees and crack the window.

07:54.813 --> 07:57.981
Y'all breath is
making it humid in here.

07:57.982 --> 08:01.218
Ooh, last thing. Pass me that plug.

08:01.219 --> 08:02.653
I wanna listen to my podcast.

08:02.654 --> 08:03.954
"Real Housewives of Atlanta:

08:03.955 --> 08:05.656
Top One Hundred Screaming Matches."

08:05.657 --> 08:09.426
Thank you, baby. [giggles]

08:09.427 --> 08:12.563
You may drive.

08:12.564 --> 08:16.233
See? I'm easy like Sunday morning.

08:16.234 --> 08:18.868
<i>Bitch! You tried it!</i>

08:19.670 --> 08:21.138
[laughter]

08:21.139 --> 08:24.241
Hey, there she is.

08:24.242 --> 08:26.110
Ah, so you got your license.

08:26.111 --> 08:29.179
Actually, we didn't get to
the driving part of the exam.

08:29.180 --> 08:32.249
Both: [giggle]

08:32.250 --> 08:33.884
Wait, you... you... you flunked?

08:33.885 --> 08:35.686
Uh-huh. [giggling]

08:35.687 --> 08:37.520
So why y'all giggling like two smurfs

08:37.522 --> 08:39.323
that just escaped Gargamel's house?

08:39.323 --> 08:42.159
Well, we didn't wanna stay
in a negative space,

08:42.159 --> 08:45.062
so we went shopping
and stopped at fro-yo.

08:45.063 --> 08:48.899
Oh, hell nah. Fro-yo is for winners.

08:48.900 --> 08:52.436
Sbarro's pizza is for losers, okay?

08:52.437 --> 08:55.072
It's okay, Daddy. I mean, I tried,

08:55.073 --> 08:58.142
but I guess driving's
just not my thing.

08:58.143 --> 09:02.279
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

09:02.280 --> 09:04.581
Since when does a straight-A student

09:04.582 --> 09:06.083
fail a written exam?

09:06.084 --> 09:09.386
Ashley, now, I wanna say that
this is racially biased,

09:09.387 --> 09:13.090
but, see, that girl
is damn near White.

09:13.091 --> 09:15.826
I mean, you're her only black friend.

09:15.827 --> 09:18.762
And that's kind of questionable.

09:18.763 --> 09:20.397
Looks like she just
made a few simple mistakes,

09:20.398 --> 09:23.667
like saying it's okay to cross
a double yellow line.

09:23.668 --> 09:26.836
She deliberately failed the test.

09:29.894 --> 09:33.183
Marlon, we don't know for
sure that she threw the test.

09:33.184 --> 09:34.652
Maybe she got nervous.

09:34.653 --> 09:38.889
Ashley, nerds don't get
nervous during tests.

09:38.890 --> 09:41.091
That's what makes them nerds.

09:41.092 --> 09:43.527
Look, there's only one way to
get to the bottom of this.

09:43.528 --> 09:46.997
- Not...
- both: The Guilt Triple.

09:46.998 --> 09:50.200
All I need to do is ask her
the same questions three times.

09:50.201 --> 09:51.735
She's gonna crack.

09:51.736 --> 09:53.437
Works every time.

09:53.438 --> 09:55.172
Sometimes.

09:55.173 --> 09:56.740
Usually.

09:56.741 --> 09:57.875
Marley.

09:57.876 --> 10:00.945
We need to talk to you.

10:00.946 --> 10:03.581
Sweetheart,
we know you knew the answers

10:03.582 --> 10:05.149
to the questions on that test.

10:05.150 --> 10:07.685
Oh, I guess I just forgot.

10:07.686 --> 10:10.721
[mock chuckling] She forgot.

10:10.722 --> 10:12.356
She forgot. [chuckles]

10:12.357 --> 10:14.258
So you didn't throw that test?

10:14.259 --> 10:15.693
No.

10:15.694 --> 10:19.530
You didn't throw that test?

10:19.531 --> 10:22.266
[snickers] I said no.

10:22.267 --> 10:25.769
[clicks tongue]

10:25.770 --> 10:28.439
You didn't throw that test?

10:28.440 --> 10:30.574
Okay, fine, I threw the test.

10:30.575 --> 10:34.912
Boom! Guilt Triple!

10:34.913 --> 10:37.848
Sweetheart, why?

10:37.849 --> 10:39.750
I guess I'm just scared to drive.

10:39.751 --> 10:42.086
And throwing the test
was my only way out of it.

10:42.087 --> 10:43.988
Oh, well, honey, that's okay.

10:43.989 --> 10:46.056
If you're not ready to drive,
you don't have to.

10:46.057 --> 10:48.459
Hol' uh, hol' uh, hol' uh,
hol' uh, hol' uh, hol' uh,

10:48.460 --> 10:50.628
hol' uh, hol' uh.

10:50.629 --> 10:52.062
Huh...

10:52.063 --> 10:55.165
Hold up.

10:55.166 --> 10:57.167
This is a teachable moment here, okay?

10:57.168 --> 10:59.203
Listen, Marley, when things scare you,

10:59.204 --> 11:00.437
you gotta push through.

11:00.438 --> 11:01.705
When I see something that scares me,

11:01.706 --> 11:03.674
I walk up to it,
I look it in its face,

11:03.675 --> 11:06.644
I give it that cold,
crushing, mean grill,

11:06.645 --> 11:08.946
and then I bust its ass.

11:08.947 --> 11:11.582
Oh, so you're good with big dogs now?

11:11.583 --> 11:14.618
Well, that's different.
Big dogs will kill you.

11:14.619 --> 11:16.020
And cars can't?

11:16.021 --> 11:19.156
I don't wanna drive, Daddy. I'm sorry.

11:19.157 --> 11:20.457
You're gonna run up the stairs?

11:20.458 --> 11:23.893
That... that's a white girl
move right there.

11:24.495 --> 11:26.864
And why are you gonna
put me on blast like that?

11:26.865 --> 11:29.299
Because you were
being a hypocrite, Marlon.

11:29.300 --> 11:32.468
Nah. That never bothered you before.

11:34.204 --> 11:35.105
Something's up.

11:35.106 --> 11:37.474
And you passed up a teachable moment?

11:37.475 --> 11:41.578
Which, by the way,
is a phrase you taught me.

11:41.579 --> 11:44.081
There's some other reason
why you acting like this.

11:44.082 --> 11:46.617
No, there isn't.

11:46.618 --> 11:49.185
There's no other reason?

11:50.587 --> 11:53.656
There's no other reason?

11:54.358 --> 11:56.827
There's no other reason?

11:56.828 --> 11:58.929
Okay, fine, I like driving her around.

11:58.930 --> 12:01.832
Boom!

12:01.833 --> 12:03.500
Guilt Triple.

12:03.501 --> 12:06.403
Marlon, when she was a baby,
I breastfed her.

12:06.404 --> 12:07.738
And that ended.

12:07.739 --> 12:10.107
And then I bathed her,
and I combed her hair,

12:10.108 --> 12:11.542
and that's all over.

12:11.543 --> 12:14.244
This time in the car
is the only time I have left

12:14.245 --> 12:15.646
before she goes off to college.

12:15.647 --> 12:16.847
You're just afraid you're gonna lose

12:16.848 --> 12:17.915
your little roll dawg.

12:17.916 --> 12:19.616
It's funny to hear about fear

12:19.617 --> 12:23.953
from a man who watched most of
"Air Bud" with his eyes closed.

12:24.688 --> 12:28.125
Ooh, you petty.

12:28.126 --> 12:30.594
But you know what? You're right.

12:30.595 --> 12:32.463
I have to prove to you both

12:32.464 --> 12:34.131
that you can push through fear.

12:34.132 --> 12:36.300
And how are you gonna do that?

12:36.301 --> 12:40.070
By overcoming my own.

12:40.071 --> 12:41.905
And for the record,

12:41.906 --> 12:45.109
a Golden Retriever
with an 8-foot vertical

12:45.110 --> 12:47.578
is scary as hell.

12:47.579 --> 12:50.481
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

12:50.482 --> 12:52.850
Remember, Yvette,

12:52.851 --> 12:57.554
do nothing, say nothing...

12:57.555 --> 13:01.157
be nothing. Observe.

13:09.633 --> 13:13.470
Dear Lord, what is that smell?

13:13.471 --> 13:15.572
I apologize for the smell.

13:15.573 --> 13:18.008
Someone "shomited" in here last night.

13:18.009 --> 13:22.279
Yeah, both ends, if you know
what I'm talking about.

13:22.280 --> 13:24.581
They broke my only rule.

13:24.582 --> 13:27.551
Do not throw up in my Toyota Camry.

13:27.552 --> 13:31.054
I was forced to give 'em zero stars.

13:31.055 --> 13:33.590
[gags]

13:33.591 --> 13:35.225
Oh, my God.

13:35.226 --> 13:36.860
This is happening.

13:36.861 --> 13:38.128
We're going live in five.

13:38.129 --> 13:39.630
[retches]

13:39.631 --> 13:41.131
[coughs]

13:41.132 --> 13:44.201
You'll remain calm. You'll do nothing.

13:44.202 --> 13:47.471
You'll find inner peace.

13:47.472 --> 13:49.138
Okay.

13:51.208 --> 13:53.944
Wow. [chuckles]

13:53.945 --> 13:55.312
This is working.

13:55.313 --> 13:58.015
Good looking out, Stevie.

13:58.016 --> 14:00.717
[retches]

14:00.718 --> 14:02.653

[gags]

14:04.656 --> 14:07.424
[retching]

14:07.425 --> 14:10.194
All right, family.

14:10.195 --> 14:12.362
What does Daddy say about dogs?

14:12.363 --> 14:15.833
They try to play you for
a sucka, but you ain't the one.

14:15.834 --> 14:17.901
Yeah, you're damn right,
and I don't trust 'em.

14:17.902 --> 14:19.436
And we're here because?

14:19.437 --> 14:22.539
Because I brought
your little ass here, okay?

14:22.540 --> 14:24.741
Because your father
wants to show everyone

14:24.742 --> 14:27.144
- that he can pet a dog.
- That's right.

14:27.145 --> 14:28.846
Not just a dog.

14:28.847 --> 14:32.249
I'm going to pet
the biggest dog they got.

14:32.250 --> 14:38.055
'Cause I'm gonna show you, you,
and you, Petty Pendergrass,

14:38.056 --> 14:40.891
that I can push through my fears.

14:40.892 --> 14:41.992
Okay?

14:41.993 --> 14:44.294
I'ma walk up to the dog.

14:44.295 --> 14:46.163
I'm a mean mug him, like, [growls].

14:46.164 --> 14:48.465
I'ma growl in his face. [growls]

14:48.466 --> 14:51.869
And I'ma... [growls]...
cold pet his ass.

14:51.870 --> 14:54.338
And there ain't nothing he can
do, except... he gonna be my...

14:54.339 --> 14:58.208
[shrieking]

14:58.209 --> 15:01.678
Oh, God. That's an...
that's a damn bear.

15:01.679 --> 15:03.413
All right, that's what I thought.

15:03.414 --> 15:05.082
Kids, who wants to go to Red Robin?

15:05.083 --> 15:07.150
- All: Me!
- Oh, I love the cheese fries.

15:07.151 --> 15:10.988
Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.

15:10.989 --> 15:13.257
Now, I... I can do this.

15:13.258 --> 15:16.425
Okay? Conquering a fear.

15:21.999 --> 15:26.402
I'ma go incognegro.

He almost bit my hand off.

15:55.433 --> 15:57.534
You know what? Forget it.

15:57.535 --> 15:59.670
Marley, just drive
around with your Mama.

15:59.671 --> 16:01.638
Daddy, he's not gonna hurt you.

16:01.639 --> 16:04.507
I think he's asleep.

16:06.443 --> 16:07.711
Naw, he ain't asleep.

16:07.712 --> 16:09.346
See, that's what
he wants you to think.

16:09.347 --> 16:12.015
I'm onto you, brother. I'm on to you.

16:12.016 --> 16:13.150
Marlon.

16:13.151 --> 16:14.952
That dog is a sweetheart, okay?

16:14.953 --> 16:17.788
Excuse me, do you have anything
a little more ferocious,

16:17.789 --> 16:20.590
like something that you have
to feed with a long stick?

16:20.591 --> 16:23.026
N... no. No.

16:23.027 --> 16:25.896
I want to pet that dog.

16:25.897 --> 16:27.731
- I'm conquering my fears.
- Yep.

16:27.732 --> 16:29.433
- Remember, you got this.
- We're gonna do this.

16:29.434 --> 16:31.268
- Both: Yeah.
- Okay, just say bye to me.

16:31.269 --> 16:34.905
I love you, son. [sobbing]

16:34.906 --> 16:37.507
- Oh, take care of your brother.
- Okay.

16:37.508 --> 16:39.242
- I didn't leave him no money.
- Oh.

16:39.243 --> 16:43.646
I know he'd spend it all
on sneakers and candy.

16:45.282 --> 16:48.085
Hold me.

16:48.086 --> 16:49.219
Oh.

16:49.220 --> 16:51.722
If we could just do it one last time.

16:51.723 --> 16:53.857
- Marlon.
- Okay, okay.

16:53.858 --> 16:57.760
- Go pet that dog.
- Okay, okay.

17:01.131 --> 17:03.266

you gotta play it cool.

Yow! Ha!

17:26.424 --> 17:27.924
I did it. Wait, I did it.

17:27.925 --> 17:29.793
Wait, he got my arm.
[sobbing] He got my arm.

17:29.794 --> 17:31.561
No. Dad, it's your sleeve.

17:31.562 --> 17:34.064
Oh, oh, thank God. Okay.

17:34.065 --> 17:35.699
Okay, ah.

17:35.700 --> 17:37.601
Who did that? both: You did that.

17:37.602 --> 17:39.169
- Who did that? both: You did that

17:39.170 --> 17:41.738
Daddy did that. [laughs]

17:41.739 --> 17:44.241
- I'm proud of you, Daddy.
- Thank you, baby girl.

17:44.242 --> 17:46.543
Hey, I faced my fear.

17:46.544 --> 17:49.146
- Are you ready to do the same?
- I am.

17:49.147 --> 17:51.515
I'ma a take that driving test.
[chuckles]

17:51.516 --> 17:52.549
That's my girl.

17:52.550 --> 17:55.419
And hey, if you ever have any doubts,

17:55.420 --> 17:57.254
I want you to remember your Daddy,

17:57.255 --> 18:00.390
and I want you to push through
and conquer your fears.

18:00.391 --> 18:01.858
See, I used to be afraid of dogs.

18:01.859 --> 18:03.293
- Yeah.
- Now I ain't.

18:03.294 --> 18:04.995
- I ain't afraid of no dogs.
- That's right.

18:04.996 --> 18:07.798
I wish a dog was here ri... [shrieks]

18:07.799 --> 18:09.865

18:15.816 --> 18:17.817
I'm not talking to you,
Heavin' Steven.

18:17.818 --> 18:19.885
You got me on the "No Ride" list.

18:19.886 --> 18:22.288
Stevie, how could you?

18:22.289 --> 18:26.192
The girl is already
on the "No Man" list.

18:26.193 --> 18:28.060
I was on task to complete another

18:28.061 --> 18:29.729
stellar moment of nothingness.

18:29.730 --> 18:33.158
But then I vomited,
and that was on me.

18:33.159 --> 18:34.859
And on my shoes.

18:34.860 --> 18:37.828
And a little bit on Yvette.

18:39.230 --> 18:41.399
Hey!

18:41.400 --> 18:43.835
- So did you pass?
- I passed.

18:43.836 --> 18:47.105
Yay! Congrats.

18:47.106 --> 18:48.039
But you're all sad.

18:48.040 --> 18:51.309
Did you crash the car
on the way back home?

18:51.310 --> 18:53.745
Sweetheart, what's the matter?

18:53.746 --> 18:55.180
[sighs] I don't know.

18:55.181 --> 18:56.080
I mean,

18:56.081 --> 18:58.349
I guess this means I'm a grown-up now.

18:58.350 --> 19:02.353
Next I have to move out,
pay bills, be on my own.

19:02.354 --> 19:04.856
That's even scarier than driving.

19:04.857 --> 19:06.758
Yeah, scary to you.

19:06.759 --> 19:08.726
That just made my pockets real happy.

19:08.727 --> 19:11.696
My wallet went, "Hey!"

19:11.697 --> 19:13.198
[laughs]

19:13.199 --> 19:17.335
Honey, can I let you in
on a little secret?

19:17.336 --> 19:18.836
I'm scared too.

19:18.837 --> 19:21.539
Really? What're you scared of?

19:21.540 --> 19:23.841
Letting you grow up.

19:23.842 --> 19:26.211
But when I watched you
get your license,

19:26.212 --> 19:29.614
and Daddy kind of pet
that very docile dog...

19:29.615 --> 19:31.182
[groans]

19:31.183 --> 19:34.632
I realized that once
we face our fears,

19:34.633 --> 19:36.333
they're not so bad after all.

19:36.334 --> 19:38.169
Hey.

19:38.170 --> 19:40.204
You guys don't have to worry
about this right now.

19:40.205 --> 19:42.411
Girl, you just got your license, huh?

19:42.412 --> 19:43.445
What you gonna do?

19:43.446 --> 19:44.780
You gonna go drag racin'?

19:44.781 --> 19:46.315
What, you gonna ghost ride the whip?

19:46.316 --> 19:48.117
You gonna take
the car down to the 'Shaw

19:48.118 --> 19:49.985
and holla at all
the boys, like, "Hey."

19:49.986 --> 19:52.054
What? Psh.

19:52.055 --> 19:53.622
You know what?

19:53.623 --> 19:56.291
I think I'm gonna go to
the Art Walk with Kristie.

19:56.292 --> 19:58.794
Psh. Girl, you better slow down.

19:58.795 --> 20:01.530
You a wild one.
You going to the Art Walk?

20:01.531 --> 20:04.199
Next thing you know you're
gonna be at the bookstore.

20:04.200 --> 20:06.535
And then you... you may go real crazy

20:06.536 --> 20:08.837
and be up at the museum.

20:08.838 --> 20:10.806
[mimicking voice]
Hello, we up in LACMA.

20:10.807 --> 20:12.774
Like, we're learning stuff.

20:12.775 --> 20:14.843
[chuckles]

20:14.844 --> 20:18.947
- I'm proud of you.
- Thanks, Dad.

20:18.948 --> 20:20.715
Thank you.

20:24.019 --> 20:25.967
You were right, Marlon.

20:25.968 --> 20:29.670
I was afraid to let
my little roll dawg go.

20:29.671 --> 20:31.339
Gotta let 'em fly.

20:31.340 --> 20:34.308
I know, but you gotta admit,
it's kind of hard

20:34.309 --> 20:35.643
letting her grow up.

20:35.644 --> 20:38.311
Tsk. Nah, I'm cool.

20:38.980 --> 20:41.215
So Marley growing up
doesn't make you sad?

20:41.216 --> 20:45.286
Tsk, girl, please. Huh.

20:45.287 --> 20:47.254
Marley growing up
doesn't make you sad?

20:47.255 --> 20:50.424
Uh, you ain't even doing it right.

20:50.425 --> 20:52.672
Marley growing up
doesn't make you sad?

20:52.690 --> 20:53.717
[whimpers]

20:53.718 --> 20:55.418
It hurts so much inside.

20:56.800 --> 20:58.028
Boom.

20:58.029 --> 20:59.329
Guilt Triple. Aw.

21:01.058 --> 21:03.725
Wait. She got your keys or mine?

21:04.089 --> 21:06.015
Girl! Marley!

21:06.085 --> 21:07.843
That's my Range Rover. Ah, hell nah.

21:07.844 --> 21:10.277
Take Mommy's... Mommy... the minivan.

21:10.450 --> 21:16.792
