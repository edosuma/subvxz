00:01.585 --> 00:03.286
<i> Someone was there
from</i> Midnight Special.

00:03.532 --> 00:04.764
They cancelled.

00:04.766 --> 00:06.433
<i> It's not your fault.</i>

00:06.435 --> 00:08.834
God's got it out for the
Hobbs, that's all I know.

00:08.836 --> 00:10.202
Who do we talk to about stage time?

00:10.204 --> 00:12.037
Richard Pryor's going on Thursday night.

00:12.039 --> 00:14.106
I can, uh, bump him if it means that

00:14.108 --> 00:15.974
I can get some pros on stage.

00:15.976 --> 00:18.544
I was on that list every
week, and now look at me.

00:18.546 --> 00:20.212
I got the main room whenever I want it,

00:20.214 --> 00:22.381
as long as it's ten
minutes before closing.

00:22.383 --> 00:23.782
<i>Let me help you, hmm?</i>

00:23.784 --> 00:27.151
Find a voice that women can relate to.

00:27.153 --> 00:28.786
There is room for me too,

00:28.788 --> 00:30.455
I just need your stage to prove it.

00:30.457 --> 00:33.691
When you're ready.

00:33.693 --> 00:36.461
You killed it at The Store last night.

00:36.463 --> 00:38.296
You know, I-I wanted to be here.

00:38.298 --> 00:40.198
But it's just one fucking night, right?

00:40.200 --> 00:42.400
Caught my ex getting a
blow job in our office.

00:42.402 --> 00:44.033
That was one fucking night too.

00:44.035 --> 00:45.702
Shouldn't there be some
sort of pecking order

00:45.704 --> 00:47.504
based off time put in at the club?

00:47.506 --> 00:48.871
Oh, there's a pecking order.

00:48.873 --> 00:50.974
me, you.

a good time, ma'am?</i>

01:03.854 --> 01:05.019
<i>Really? All right.</i>

01:05.022 --> 01:06.755
<i>Tell your face.</i>

01:11.229 --> 01:12.928
<i> Guys, Vietnam's
coming to an end.</i>

01:12.930 --> 01:15.063
<i>That means what?</i>

01:15.065 --> 01:16.865
<i>Comedians are coming home...</i>

01:16.867 --> 01:17.865
<i>from Canada.</i>

01:19.402 --> 01:20.768

lot of handyman work,</i>

01:20.770 --> 01:22.370
<i>growing up.</i>

01:22.372 --> 01:25.006

was in the business...</i>

01:33.016 --> 01:35.081
<i> Well, what are
you doing in here?</i>

01:35.083 --> 01:37.251
<i>That hooker in the trunk
ain't gonna bury herself.</i>

01:42.625 --> 01:44.057
<i> All right, thank you, folks.</i>

01:44.059 --> 01:45.392
<i>You've been a...</i>

01:45.394 --> 01:46.527

Excuse me.

02:39.478 --> 02:43.012
I'm looking for Teddy.

02:43.014 --> 02:44.480
The owner does time?

02:44.482 --> 02:46.416
He does when there are
holes in the lineup.

02:46.418 --> 02:48.451
Well, why's he singing?

02:48.453 --> 02:51.521
He ran out of jokes.

03:11.141 --> 03:12.841
Hey, do you folks like impressions?

03:12.843 --> 03:14.443
Yeah.

03:14.445 --> 03:17.010
Well, you're gonna be
impressed by this next guy.

03:17.012 --> 03:19.347
Please welcome to the stage

03:19.349 --> 03:20.981
Billy Quandt!

03:41.703 --> 03:44.070
<i>You know what you guys are?</i>

03:44.072 --> 03:45.838
<i>You're alchemists.</i>

03:45.840 --> 03:49.041
<i>You create pleasure from pain.</i>

03:49.043 --> 03:51.410
<i>And that is a virtuous gift, my friend.</i>

03:51.412 --> 03:53.845
So why the free grub?

03:53.847 --> 03:55.814
Because at King Theodore's,

03:55.816 --> 03:57.816
the comic is king.

03:57.818 --> 03:59.585
All right, don't let
this crown fool you.

03:59.587 --> 04:01.153
I just work here.

04:01.155 --> 04:03.722
And sure, yeah-yeah, I
can carry a tune, but...

04:03.724 --> 04:05.924
you're the rock stars, all right?

04:05.926 --> 04:08.326
You keep the doors open.
I just hold the key.

04:08.328 --> 04:09.860
Uh, what-what's, uh,
what's the buffet like

04:09.862 --> 04:11.329
over at Goldie's?

04:11.331 --> 04:13.030
You know, cocktail onions,

04:13.032 --> 04:15.099
lemon twists, ice cubes.

04:15.101 --> 04:16.534
Usual stuff.

04:16.536 --> 04:18.736
That-that's a shame.

04:18.738 --> 04:20.438
Please, help yourself.

04:20.440 --> 04:22.607
Oh, try the-try the shrimp.

04:22.609 --> 04:26.410
They're feathered in coconut.

04:29.448 --> 04:32.081
Do you ever notice how
the American dream

04:32.083 --> 04:35.018
is to have your house
filled with Mexicans?

04:35.020 --> 04:36.353
Think about it.

04:36.355 --> 04:38.221
Your big house, your big car,

04:38.223 --> 04:39.956
your big pool isn't complete

04:39.958 --> 04:42.124
unless you have Mexicans running around,

04:42.126 --> 04:44.860
scrubbing that shit nonstop.

04:44.862 --> 04:48.130
Saying, "You like this, meester?
It's good, meester?"

04:48.132 --> 04:49.465
Though think about this, also.

04:49.467 --> 04:51.133
We clean the inside of the house.

04:51.135 --> 04:52.901
We clean the outside of the house.

04:52.903 --> 04:56.071
We build the fucking house.

04:56.073 --> 04:59.574
We're the wet-backbone of this country.

04:59.576 --> 05:02.610
That's why we're always
saying <i>"Mi casa es su casa."</i>

05:02.612 --> 05:05.580
We're being ironic.

05:05.582 --> 05:07.415
Now, think about it, the ultimate thing

05:07.417 --> 05:09.784
is you want a Mexican to
take care of your kids.

05:09.786 --> 05:10.952
That's the best.

05:10.954 --> 05:11.986
You want a Mexican nanny?

05:11.988 --> 05:13.221
You got a Mexican nanny?

05:13.223 --> 05:14.322
You have one already?

05:14.324 --> 05:15.889
Good one, old?

05:15.891 --> 05:16.957
That's the best kind.

05:16.959 --> 05:19.226
You want an old nanny, right?

05:19.228 --> 05:21.161
They're not going anywhere.
They're not dating.

05:21.163 --> 05:22.763
Right?

05:22.765 --> 05:26.667
All they're doing is
concentrating on your child.

05:26.669 --> 05:30.303
Right now, there's an
eight-year-old boy in Tijuana.

05:30.305 --> 05:32.305
Grandmother's reading him a book.

05:32.307 --> 05:34.574
Mom is making him a quesadilla.

05:34.576 --> 05:37.610
His father is trimming hedges outside.

05:37.612 --> 05:38.978
He's living the American dream

05:38.980 --> 05:41.113
and he doesn't even know it.

05:41.115 --> 05:43.449
The pool at the Pines was
shaped like a crescent.

05:43.451 --> 05:44.950
I would bet my left ear on that.

05:44.952 --> 05:46.753
The pool at the Pines

05:46.755 --> 05:48.521
was a fucking oval.

05:48.523 --> 05:50.355
I spent eight summers there.

05:50.357 --> 05:52.824
Ugh, you're betting your ear
'cause you don't need it

05:52.826 --> 05:54.325
because you don't listen.

05:55.863 --> 05:57.962
All right, Judy, I'm listening.

05:57.964 --> 05:59.030
Paint me a picture.

05:59.032 --> 06:01.032
Lights up. Catskills, 1956.

06:01.034 --> 06:02.333
- Aye?
- Okay. All right.

06:02.335 --> 06:04.770
Uh, I'm seeing you and you...

06:04.772 --> 06:06.504
you're sitting on Sid's lap,

06:06.506 --> 06:09.106
eight months pregnant with Mandy,

06:09.108 --> 06:11.275
dressed as an apricot hamantaschen

06:11.277 --> 06:13.511
because it was one of
those fucking nights,

06:13.513 --> 06:15.345
you know, with the costumes

06:15.347 --> 06:16.881
and-and the-and the singing

06:16.883 --> 06:18.849
and we were all dressed as foods.

06:18.851 --> 06:21.719
I'm knocked up with
Jake but don't know it.

06:21.721 --> 06:22.787
Yeah.

06:22.789 --> 06:24.888
And the fucking pool was oval.

06:26.725 --> 06:27.724
You slept today?

06:27.726 --> 06:28.825
Mmm.

06:28.827 --> 06:30.860
I'm fine.

06:30.862 --> 06:33.863
I like to, uh, spread my
eight hours beauty sleep

06:33.865 --> 06:36.065
over at least a week.

06:36.067 --> 06:39.001
I did a 3 a.m. at the Flamingo.

06:39.003 --> 06:42.538
And, you know, got in the
car, drove four hours here.

06:42.540 --> 06:43.806
Whatever.

06:43.808 --> 06:45.707
That's my thing now.

06:45.709 --> 06:48.844
I'm on Vegas Standard Time.

06:49.713 --> 06:51.680
My sun rises at 1 a.m.

06:51.682 --> 06:53.081
Wake up, I go to work at three,

06:53.083 --> 06:54.750
do 45 minutes, walk up the Strip

06:54.752 --> 06:58.085
to Sammy's club, I do another set.

06:58.087 --> 07:00.755
Then it's breakfast
with the working girls.

07:02.358 --> 07:04.258
I tell them how I killed.

07:04.260 --> 07:06.226
They tell me how they almost got killed.

07:08.498 --> 07:09.864
Showbiz.

07:09.866 --> 07:11.398
Nothing like LA though, huh?

07:13.102 --> 07:15.735
Laughs only matter on the coast.

07:18.874 --> 07:21.775
Plus...

07:21.777 --> 07:24.911
I miss seeing you.

07:26.949 --> 07:28.715
How is Jakey?

07:28.717 --> 07:30.116
You know, driven.

07:30.118 --> 07:31.250
Got a head of lettuce.

07:31.252 --> 07:32.751
Oh.

07:32.753 --> 07:35.020
- How's Mandy?
- Ugh. Oy.

07:35.022 --> 07:36.121
She'll turn the corner.

07:36.123 --> 07:37.389
- Nah.
- They all do.

07:37.391 --> 07:38.958
Nah.

07:38.960 --> 07:40.593
Come in.

07:40.595 --> 07:42.461
Hey. Real quick?

07:42.463 --> 07:46.932
Um, I was looking over tonight's lineup.

07:46.934 --> 07:48.766
And I know-I know I was
on there yesterday,

07:48.768 --> 07:51.803
but for some reason I'm
not-not on there now.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.304
Oh, Edgar, I...

07:53.306 --> 07:55.106
You know what? I'm
gonna go grab my seat.

07:55.108 --> 07:56.307
I'll be out in a minute.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.575
Cheers.

08:00.113 --> 08:04.782
I'm really sorry your name
fell off the list, Edgar.

08:04.784 --> 08:06.783
That happens sometimes.

08:06.785 --> 08:09.085
But now maybe you can get some more time

08:09.087 --> 08:10.621
at the fucking cafeteria

08:10.623 --> 08:12.756
Teddy sells as a comedy club.

08:12.758 --> 08:14.224
That's what this is about?

08:14.226 --> 08:15.826
No, actually, I was thinking about

08:15.828 --> 08:17.160
knitting you a sweater,

08:17.162 --> 08:19.129
but I wanted to discuss it with you

08:19.131 --> 08:20.463
before committing to the color.

08:20.465 --> 08:22.598
What the fuck do you think it's about?

08:22.600 --> 08:25.902
Have I ever been unclear about this?

08:25.904 --> 08:28.137
It was fifteen minutes and appetizers.

08:28.139 --> 08:30.105
Don't act surprised or-or stupid.

08:30.107 --> 08:33.174
I-I can't really tell which
one you're going for.

08:33.177 --> 08:34.476
You want to go to Teddy's? Go.

08:34.477 --> 08:35.845
I am not stopping you.

08:35.847 --> 08:37.580
Goldie, come on, the guy
had fucking shrimp.

08:37.582 --> 08:39.280
Eh, I understand.

08:39.283 --> 08:42.683
Shrimp is very tasty.

08:42.686 --> 08:45.353
You wouldn't be pulling
this shit if it was Carlin.

08:45.355 --> 08:47.589
Carlin didn't flop in my office

08:47.591 --> 08:49.290
while his teeth came in for a month.

08:49.292 --> 08:52.527
Carlin didn't shower in my fucking sink.

08:52.529 --> 08:54.863
Well, Carlin didn't paint
your fucking comedy club

08:54.865 --> 08:56.931
for free either.

09:03.138 --> 09:06.306
And that's why you'll never
see my name in the Bible.

09:06.308 --> 09:07.808
Not even in the sexy parts.

09:10.145 --> 09:12.780
My parents died in a car
crash when I was ten.

09:12.782 --> 09:14.948
Christ, with this shit again?

09:14.950 --> 09:16.115
- Shh.
- They hit a tree.

09:16.117 --> 09:17.183
What?

09:17.185 --> 09:18.885
I think that segue hit a tree.

09:18.887 --> 09:21.454
Their obit
read that their car was

09:21.456 --> 09:24.290
wrapped around a tree, which I liked

09:24.292 --> 09:25.458
'cause I thought it gave their death

09:25.460 --> 09:27.460
a kind of Christmas-y feeling.

09:28.496 --> 09:30.362
The funny thing about death

09:30.364 --> 09:32.864
is it's the one thing
we all have in common

09:32.866 --> 09:35.033
and no one knows how to talk about it.

09:35.035 --> 09:37.002
Especially to kids.

09:37.004 --> 09:40.005
People would say to me,
"They're not gone.

09:40.007 --> 09:41.840
They'll always be with you."

09:41.842 --> 09:45.543
Well, that's nice, except
no one ever thinks about

09:45.545 --> 09:50.047
the fact that one day I'm gonna
grow up and want to get laid.

09:50.049 --> 09:53.985
And it was worse for me because
I had a very critical mom.

09:53.987 --> 09:56.988
The first time I had
sex, all I could hear

09:56.990 --> 09:59.590
was my dead mom's voice.

09:59.592 --> 10:01.659
"Really, Cassie?

10:01.661 --> 10:04.028
Is that how you're gonna fuck this guy?"

10:04.030 --> 10:05.561
"Because...

10:05.563 --> 10:07.063
if you're just gonna
lay there like that,

10:07.065 --> 10:08.665
he's gonna think he's screwing me

10:08.667 --> 10:10.266
right after the accident."

10:18.243 --> 10:20.043
I'm so sorry for your loss.

10:20.045 --> 10:22.845
Her mother passed in November.
Stage two lymphoma.

10:22.847 --> 10:24.847
It gets easier.

10:24.849 --> 10:26.749
Thank you for your... sympathy.

10:28.585 --> 10:29.885
Hey, Cass,

10:29.887 --> 10:32.254
I love what you did up there.

10:32.256 --> 10:33.889
- Edgy shit.
- Thanks.

10:33.891 --> 10:35.423
What are you, deaf now?

10:35.425 --> 10:37.026
Did you not just see that, Steve?

10:37.028 --> 10:38.293
She sucked.

10:38.295 --> 10:40.094
Wish I had my derringer.

10:40.096 --> 10:42.630
I'd reunite her with her
mom and dad right now.

10:42.632 --> 10:44.398
Hey, Sam, be nice.

10:44.400 --> 10:46.567
He doesn't mean that. He
doesn't even have a gun.

10:46.569 --> 10:47.702
Fuck off, Steve.

10:47.704 --> 10:48.803
You get The Main Stage

10:48.805 --> 10:50.237
and that's what you do with it?

10:50.239 --> 10:51.973
Fuck the next three comics
going up after you?

10:51.975 --> 10:53.574
It's a Mic, not a shovel.

10:53.576 --> 10:56.442
Look at this crowd. They're
just like your parents.

10:56.444 --> 10:57.277
No pulse.

11:04.286 --> 11:05.652
Dead loved ones.

11:05.654 --> 11:07.721
Not the evergreen you thought it was.

11:07.723 --> 11:09.255
It's a work in progress.

11:09.257 --> 11:11.324
You know, I usually
forget you're Jewish.

11:11.326 --> 11:12.659
And then you make me laugh.

11:12.661 --> 11:14.794
What, you want me to be

11:14.796 --> 11:16.896
more like Judy Catskills over there?

11:16.898 --> 11:18.430
Borscht bleeding out of my ears?

11:18.432 --> 11:20.800
Shaking my tits for shekels?
No thank you.

11:20.802 --> 11:23.969
Unlike you, when she drives away
after performing, she's not

11:23.971 --> 11:26.672
followed by a procession of
cars with their headlights on.

11:26.674 --> 11:29.141
Plant that seed between your ears.

11:29.143 --> 11:30.508
I'm sorry to interrupt,

11:30.510 --> 11:32.077
but I saw what you did

11:32.079 --> 11:35.947
and you were so brave
and honest up there.

11:37.751 --> 11:40.484
Thank you.

11:40.486 --> 11:43.855
Too bad she couldn't have wedged
"funny" in there somewhere.

11:43.857 --> 11:45.523
Right.

11:47.159 --> 11:48.926
<i> Man, what did
she expect me to do?</i>

11:48.928 --> 11:51.528
Goldie's has more comedians
than she has spots.

11:51.530 --> 11:52.863
Half the time you call
in, you can't even

11:52.865 --> 11:54.798
get up until after 1 a.m.

11:54.800 --> 11:57.500
Look, it's not not unfair.

11:57.502 --> 11:59.103
That's the eleventh commandment:

11:59.105 --> 12:02.039
you don't perform in other
comedy clubs inside LA.

12:02.041 --> 12:04.473
I'd like to help you, but,
hey, rules are rules.

12:04.475 --> 12:06.008
Yeah, you made your bed.

12:06.010 --> 12:08.344
Teddy's, he's got spots
all over the place.

12:08.346 --> 12:09.946
You-you could call in right now

12:09.948 --> 12:12.014
and get up tomorrow night 9 p.m.
on the dot.

12:12.016 --> 12:15.051
Plus the buffet, fuck.

12:15.053 --> 12:17.353
What does that mean? "Buffet"?

12:17.355 --> 12:19.822
If-if you're a comedian,
there's a free buffet.

12:19.824 --> 12:21.189
Wait, like you can just eat?

12:21.191 --> 12:22.357
Yeah.

12:22.359 --> 12:23.959
It's delicious.

12:26.063 --> 12:28.063
If we could do a spot at
Teddy's, say, twice a week...

12:28.065 --> 12:29.697
Tops.

12:29.699 --> 12:31.666
That would give us a safe
place to hone our stuff

12:31.668 --> 12:33.401
so when we come here, we're
more polished, more rehearsed.

12:33.403 --> 12:34.803
And you would
always get first dibs.

12:34.805 --> 12:36.638
Always. Obviously.

12:36.640 --> 12:39.339
'Cause why would we be punished
for wanting to eat, you know?

12:39.341 --> 12:40.841
Uh, I'm not directing that at you,

12:40.843 --> 12:42.977
I just, uh, I'm-I'm just asking to ask.

12:42.979 --> 12:44.678
Punish you?

12:44.680 --> 12:46.380
Is that what's going on here?
You're being punished?

12:46.382 --> 12:47.481
Did I say "punished"?

12:47.483 --> 12:49.750
No one feels punished.

12:49.752 --> 12:51.652
I-I feel-I feel punished.

12:51.654 --> 12:53.520
All right.

12:53.522 --> 12:56.589
Let's review the food pyramid, huh?

12:56.591 --> 12:59.092
Up top, you got your
Pryors, your Prinzes,

12:59.094 --> 13:00.226
and they can go wherever they want.

13:00.228 --> 13:01.828
They've earned it.

13:01.830 --> 13:04.363
Open Mic-ers I could give
two slim shits about.

13:04.365 --> 13:07.500
It's comics like you, you, you...

13:07.502 --> 13:08.734
to a lesser degree, you...

13:08.736 --> 13:11.604
the raw talent I give my time to,

13:11.606 --> 13:13.371
who I nurture,

13:13.373 --> 13:16.909
whose shadows I've sewn to their bodies?

13:16.911 --> 13:19.077
Those are the ungrateful bastards

13:19.079 --> 13:21.613
I might take issue with if
they're putting in time

13:21.615 --> 13:24.082
with my "competition."

13:24.084 --> 13:28.653
This club is the only runway to Carson.

13:28.655 --> 13:31.755
His guys come here, not Teddy's.

13:31.757 --> 13:36.093
Mitch comes <i> here.</i>

13:36.095 --> 13:38.930
You think I comp his drinks and his food

13:38.932 --> 13:40.264
and his fucking bullshit

13:40.266 --> 13:42.433
so he can watch you "being punished"

13:42.435 --> 13:44.135
in front of a packed house?

13:44.137 --> 13:46.636
Goldie, we're very grateful
Very, very grateful.

13:46.638 --> 13:48.471
But more clubs equals more exposure

13:48.473 --> 13:50.140
and the better our names
look on your marquee.

13:50.142 --> 13:52.943
And that gets us closer
to some actual pay.

13:52.945 --> 13:56.313
'Cause at some point, somewhere,

13:56.315 --> 13:57.914
we need to get paid.

13:57.916 --> 13:59.482
Don't think about money.

13:59.484 --> 14:01.351
- Money, schmoney.
- I-I don't.

14:01.353 --> 14:03.518
I just have a six-week-old
that's a greedy motherfucker.

14:03.520 --> 14:05.821
Ah, that's why God invented the day job.

14:05.823 --> 14:08.023
Even made his own son
build coffee tables

14:08.025 --> 14:09.424
before handing over the reins.

14:09.426 --> 14:12.794
Every college student across the USA

14:12.796 --> 14:16.765
work their asses off until he graduates.

14:16.767 --> 14:18.367
It's understood.

14:18.369 --> 14:19.801
This is a school.

14:19.803 --> 14:22.036
What school pays its students?

14:22.038 --> 14:23.972
I feel like if
you wanted the answer,

14:23.974 --> 14:25.639
you wouldn't have opened the door.

14:25.641 --> 14:27.541
This is a school, Bill.

14:27.543 --> 14:30.879
It's not like we here on the GI Bill.

14:30.881 --> 14:32.713
How's that job with Sonny and Cher

14:32.715 --> 14:34.615
working out for you,
Ralph, the one I set up?

14:40.455 --> 14:41.855
So...

14:41.857 --> 14:43.523
me and you, we're-we're good

14:43.525 --> 14:45.125
now that we-we talked?

14:45.127 --> 14:46.994
What do you think?

14:49.531 --> 14:53.000
Why do you have to make
everything so fucking personal?

14:53.002 --> 14:54.400
- Personal?
- It's business, Goldie.

14:54.402 --> 14:57.503
That's all. It's just fucking business.

15:08.849 --> 15:09.715
Where are you headed?

15:09.717 --> 15:11.182
Where are you headed?

15:11.184 --> 15:12.683
Cassie's table to sit with Cassie.

15:12.685 --> 15:14.519
Yeah, great, me too, 'cause we're peers,

15:14.521 --> 15:16.187
we're professional peers and she
expects us to sit with her.

15:16.189 --> 15:17.822
It would be rude not to sit with her.

15:17.824 --> 15:19.524
I mean, her peripheral
vision's like a tractor beam.

15:19.526 --> 15:21.927
- I agree.<i> Après vous.</i>
<i>- Après vous.</i>

15:21.929 --> 15:22.827
Yo.

15:22.829 --> 15:23.828
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:23.830 --> 15:25.063
Good to see you.

15:25.065 --> 15:26.898
Ah.

15:26.900 --> 15:28.232
We're the fucking kids'
table, aren't we?

15:28.234 --> 15:29.566
Yep.

15:29.568 --> 15:30.935
Hey, uh, before I forget,
I just wanted to...

15:32.405 --> 15:35.005
Ah, surprised it took that long.

15:36.442 --> 15:39.076
Ooh, that was the Hiroshima of bombing.

15:39.078 --> 15:41.078
I mean, there's gonna
be audience members

15:41.080 --> 15:43.780
three generations from now that
still won't be able to laugh.

15:43.782 --> 15:45.614
The only difference between
your set and Pearl Harbor

15:45.616 --> 15:47.183
is that it wasn't a Sunday morning.

15:47.185 --> 15:48.918
Nice to know y'all had a
productive ride over.

15:48.920 --> 15:51.354
Cassie, you don't do sad
shit at a comedy club.

15:51.356 --> 15:52.721
It's the same reason they don't do

15:52.723 --> 15:54.257
Razor Blade Night at a Cubs game.

15:54.259 --> 15:55.925
Yeah, people come
to Goldie's to laugh,

15:55.927 --> 15:58.094
not to drop a rock into the
dark well of their soul

15:58.096 --> 16:00.563
- then dissect the ripples.
- Oh, thank you, Sylvia Plath.

16:00.565 --> 16:02.897
Well, somebody called me
brave, someone gave me a hug,

16:02.899 --> 16:04.099
and somebody else had lymphoma.

16:04.101 --> 16:05.267
Well, if laughing

16:05.269 --> 16:06.701
behind your back counts,

16:06.703 --> 16:08.070
you were a hit.

16:08.072 --> 16:09.471
Well, the highlight of the night

16:09.473 --> 16:11.473
was when Goldie pointed to Judy Elder

16:11.475 --> 16:13.875
as the high-water mark for female funny.

16:13.877 --> 16:15.310
- Mm!
- Thank you.

16:15.312 --> 16:16.811
If you're laughing at Judy Elder,

16:16.813 --> 16:18.580
you're either 72 years old

16:18.582 --> 16:20.314
or watching her climb
a flight of stairs.

16:20.316 --> 16:21.582
Hello, I'm Judy Elder.

16:21.584 --> 16:23.150
Would you like to hear
my five best jokes

16:23.152 --> 16:24.918
that are somewhere in the
general vicinity of sex?

16:24.920 --> 16:26.087
- No.
- Or how about 17 Jewish words

16:26.089 --> 16:27.421
that sound vaguely obscene

16:27.423 --> 16:29.123
if you lean into them
with all your weight?

16:29.125 --> 16:30.424
Seriously, though,

16:30.426 --> 16:32.426
I would like to be under
those dairy giants

16:32.428 --> 16:34.261
while she removes her
bra and then I just die

16:34.263 --> 16:35.896
in the impending avalanche.

16:35.898 --> 16:37.464
Well, then I could write
a joke about your death,

16:37.466 --> 16:39.165
put it in my act, and get
standing condolences

16:39.167 --> 16:40.833
from the crowd.

16:40.835 --> 16:43.236
Hey, I-I thought what you
did took a lot of balls.

16:43.238 --> 16:45.938
And you're definitely on to
something, so keep it up.

16:45.940 --> 16:48.841
Yeah, that was some...
pretty cool stuff.

16:48.843 --> 16:51.177
Thank you, guys.

16:51.179 --> 16:53.178
Hey, here's a thought.

16:53.180 --> 16:55.114
Why don't you save your two
cents for your waitress' tip?

16:55.116 --> 16:56.615
Oh, come on, Bill.

16:56.617 --> 16:58.683
Tom Thumb and his gay
aunt have the floor.

16:58.685 --> 17:00.519
Let 'em talk.

17:00.521 --> 17:02.187
I'm sorry, who were you
in <i> Grapes of Wrath</i> again?

17:02.189 --> 17:04.689
No,<i> Grapes of Wrath</i> was the
one about white people.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.825
I think he was the one
boycotting the grapes.

17:06.827 --> 17:08.160
Right, right.

17:08.162 --> 17:09.828
I just knew grapes was
in there somewhere.

17:10.997 --> 17:12.829
What's so funny, stable boy?

17:12.832 --> 17:14.432
Pardon?

17:14.434 --> 17:16.700
Aren't you Goldie's new stable boy?

17:16.702 --> 17:18.702
I have so many questions for you.

17:18.704 --> 17:21.605
Uh, most of them laced
with sexual innuendo.

17:21.607 --> 17:23.174
All right, Edgar, don't be a dick.

17:23.175 --> 17:24.675
I'm not being a dick.

17:24.676 --> 17:26.777
I just want to know
what's so fucking funny.

17:30.382 --> 17:33.183
Well, um, Edgar, if you

17:33.185 --> 17:35.285
really want to know, I
was just thinking about

17:35.287 --> 17:37.454
the time that I fucked your mom.

17:37.456 --> 17:38.855
Wait, did I ever tell you about

17:38.857 --> 17:40.657
the time that I fucked your mom?

17:40.659 --> 17:44.560
Oh, I fucked your mom so
hard your grandmama came.

17:44.562 --> 17:48.297
There I was, balls deep in
your mother's coffee stain,

17:48.299 --> 17:50.566
and 4,000 miles away in
Guadalajara, your grandmother

17:50.568 --> 17:52.468
just collapses in this bean field,

17:52.470 --> 17:54.470
screaming my name and
coming so hard that

17:54.472 --> 17:56.972
moths fly out of that
shriveled up, Grey taco.

17:56.974 --> 17:58.874
Now, I don't know this for
sure, 'cause I'm still

17:58.876 --> 18:01.209
back at your mom's,
fucking her from behind,

18:01.211 --> 18:02.643
like the donkey she used to fuck

18:02.645 --> 18:04.412
while tourists threw Chiclets at her.

18:04.414 --> 18:06.081
Right now, I'm distracted
by her endless screams

18:06.083 --> 18:08.383
of how she wants it in the ass,

18:08.385 --> 18:11.486
even though she knew we ran out
of lube like six hours ago.

18:11.488 --> 18:13.388
But I'm a problem solver.

18:13.390 --> 18:14.922
So I just start to

18:14.924 --> 18:16.891
milk those endlessly lactating tits

18:16.893 --> 18:18.192
all over my ski pole,

18:18.194 --> 18:20.060
thus providing the necessary lubricant

18:20.062 --> 18:22.162
that she desires.

18:22.164 --> 18:25.865
And I just drill your mom
so hard in the ass that

18:25.867 --> 18:28.268
I knock out the one remaining
tooth left in her head,

18:28.270 --> 18:29.736
making her come so hard that a shitload

18:29.738 --> 18:31.671
of inedible hard candies just shoot out

18:31.673 --> 18:33.407
of that piñata she calls a pussy,

18:33.409 --> 18:36.742
all over the dirt floor
of her master bedroom.

18:38.279 --> 18:41.847
And that, Edgar, is what
I found to be funny.

18:50.258 --> 18:51.557
What?

18:51.559 --> 18:53.558
Trying to decide whether or not I should

18:53.560 --> 18:55.893
fuck him up

18:55.895 --> 18:58.597
or buy a milkshake with two straws.

19:00.300 --> 19:02.434
'Cause he fucked the
shit out of your mama.

19:04.271 --> 19:05.470
You guys ready to order?

19:05.472 --> 19:07.105
You know what? You know what?

19:07.107 --> 19:10.241
Order of fries for these
motherfuckers right here.

19:10.243 --> 19:12.042
French fries all around.

19:20.919 --> 19:22.419
Hey.

19:22.421 --> 19:25.756
Think, I, uh, left my
wallet in the kitchen.

19:48.412 --> 19:50.479
<i>- ♪ I been in a wrong
place ♪</i> -

19:52.349 --> 19:54.483
Daddy's home.

19:54.485 --> 19:55.417
Shh.

19:55.419 --> 19:57.653
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:57.655 --> 20:00.021
Hi.

20:00.023 --> 20:02.523
Shh-shh-shh-shh.

20:03.826 --> 20:06.860
Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh.

20:06.862 --> 20:09.597
Why does the baby get burped
by candlelight and not me?

20:09.599 --> 20:11.465
The electricity's been shut off.

20:13.703 --> 20:15.969
- Seriously?
- Mm-hmm.

20:15.971 --> 20:18.037
After only two

20:18.039 --> 20:19.506
- threatening letters?
- Maybe the third's

20:19.508 --> 20:20.973
in that pile over there.

20:20.975 --> 20:21.974
- Shh-shh-shh-shh.
- I've been meaning

20:21.976 --> 20:23.310
to take a look at that.

20:23.312 --> 20:24.311
I just want to poke it

20:24.313 --> 20:26.580
with a stick a few more times.

20:28.850 --> 20:31.218
I'm sorry, Betz. I'll
figure something out.

20:31.220 --> 20:33.486
I think I can get my secretary job back.

20:33.488 --> 20:35.187
He can sleep right by the desk.

20:35.189 --> 20:36.455
You want to come

20:36.457 --> 20:37.956
to work with Mommy? Not really?

20:37.958 --> 20:40.058
No, what, are we in a
Charles Dickens novel?

20:40.060 --> 20:41.627
Shh, shh.

20:41.629 --> 20:43.362
How much do you think we need?

20:43.364 --> 20:47.666
Shh, shh. Another $40 a week.

20:47.668 --> 20:49.635
Fifty if you want meat.

20:49.637 --> 20:50.902
Okay.

20:50.904 --> 20:52.470
Think I can talk to Roger

20:52.472 --> 20:54.539
and grab a few more
hours at the warehouse.

20:54.541 --> 20:55.806
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

20:55.808 --> 20:57.709
Hi.

20:57.711 --> 21:00.345
You have the patience of
a saint, you know that?

21:07.254 --> 21:08.885
- Sully.
- Yeah?

21:08.887 --> 21:11.087
Take care of us, okay?

21:14.059 --> 21:16.226
<i> If you got a hankering
to take care of that...</i>

21:16.228 --> 21:19.095
Why are shrimp so fucking delicious?

21:19.097 --> 21:23.199
They-they are. End of story.

21:23.201 --> 21:25.101
What was I thinking?

21:25.103 --> 21:29.672
And... that's it.

21:29.674 --> 21:33.776
Fucking blackballed for eating shrimp.

21:33.778 --> 21:37.613
I am done.

21:37.615 --> 21:39.749
Shrimp?

21:39.751 --> 21:41.584
You're doing great, okay?

21:41.586 --> 21:43.951
Just go back down.

21:43.953 --> 21:45.787
<i> But weren't you
the one that told me</i>

21:45.789 --> 21:47.789
<i>you're on the way to the
straight and narrow?</i>

21:47.791 --> 21:49.691
<i>You're a real piece of work.
Do you know that?</i>

21:49.693 --> 21:51.393
<i> All I've ever wanted
was for you to know...</i>

21:55.965 --> 21:57.965
Hey, Maggie?

21:57.967 --> 22:00.634
You're Mexican, right?

22:00.636 --> 22:02.736
My mom's Asian.

22:02.738 --> 22:06.573
But you're part cleaning lady
on your dad's side, right?

22:06.575 --> 22:07.574
He's Filipino.

22:07.576 --> 22:09.109
Filipino?

22:09.111 --> 22:11.445
What the hell am I
supposed to do with that?

22:11.447 --> 22:12.879
Thank God you're half-chink

22:12.881 --> 22:14.415
or we'd have nothing to talk about.

22:14.417 --> 22:16.116
Your act makes me uncomfortable.

22:16.118 --> 22:17.583
He said it, not me.

22:17.585 --> 22:18.884
That's why it's smart.

22:18.886 --> 22:20.320
It's the puppet who's racist.

22:24.392 --> 22:26.992
So a Jew and a hick
walk into a convenience store...

22:26.994 --> 22:28.260
You steal all that?

22:28.262 --> 22:29.895
Man does not live on Rice-A-Roni alone.

22:29.897 --> 22:31.497
It's 90 degrees out.

22:31.499 --> 22:32.898
Oh, we know.

22:32.900 --> 22:34.666
I think the sausages are
ready to be served.

22:34.668 --> 22:36.100
Sorry to interrupt
your act, Steve.

22:36.102 --> 22:37.902
Please don't start over.

22:37.904 --> 22:39.170
Oh, it's okay, you can always
stop by later tonight,

22:39.172 --> 22:41.406
catch it in The Cellar.

22:41.408 --> 22:44.576
No. He serious?

22:44.578 --> 22:47.346
Come on, Arnie, this
asshole gets The Cellar?

22:47.348 --> 22:49.681
We've been here six weeks.
We've been up fucking twice!

22:49.683 --> 22:51.315
He gets The Cellar. You
won't even guarantee us

22:51.317 --> 22:52.983
open Mic spots? I mean, look,

22:52.985 --> 22:54.952
no offense to Steve and his
regressive sock puppet,

22:54.954 --> 22:57.621
but they fucking suck,
they really fucking suck.

22:57.623 --> 22:59.623
Ron's right, man.
He fucking blows.

22:59.625 --> 23:01.826
I mean, Hitler puppeting
an actual rabbi's corpse

23:01.828 --> 23:04.194
would be more funny and less offensive.

23:04.196 --> 23:05.696
Sorry, man, no disrespect.

23:05.698 --> 23:07.297
Guys, it's not up to me who goes up.

23:07.299 --> 23:09.165
Yes, it is, you control
the fucking set lists!

23:09.167 --> 23:10.834
Fine! I think Steve's comedy

23:10.836 --> 23:13.135
holds a mirror to our modern world.

23:13.137 --> 23:14.637
- Pardon me, but I'm invested.
- Hmm.

23:14.639 --> 23:15.805
Thank you, Arnold.

23:15.807 --> 23:17.139
And unlike you shits,

23:17.141 --> 23:19.609
I am two up-and-coming comic voices.

23:19.611 --> 23:21.644
Hey, toots, you
ever date a guy that's

23:21.646 --> 23:25.547
100% wood, 100% Al...

23:25.549 --> 23:26.982
Oh.

23:29.019 --> 23:30.786
Fucking pulp.

23:32.356 --> 23:33.321
Stop it.

23:33.323 --> 23:34.723
You're gonna break it.

23:34.725 --> 23:36.324
Well, I can't
see the weather girl.

23:36.326 --> 23:39.027
Sparky, that was me, silly goat.

23:39.029 --> 23:41.162
Maybe you should
go for a drive, Dad.

23:41.164 --> 23:43.063
You know, Detroit built this city?

23:43.065 --> 23:44.399
It's all about the car here.

23:44.401 --> 23:46.200
Gas is too expensive.

23:47.871 --> 23:49.704
There's-there's no one
at the door, Sparky.

23:49.706 --> 23:50.905
There's no one at the door.

23:50.907 --> 23:53.374
Ooh, I see legs. I see legs!

23:53.376 --> 23:56.043
Dad, look out the window,
it's 72 and smoggy.

23:56.045 --> 23:57.578
Relax already.

23:58.814 --> 24:01.314
Hey, Bill, Bill, would you help him?

24:07.022 --> 24:10.390
Can't believe she gave my
time to Fat fucking Tubs.

24:10.392 --> 24:11.925
Fucking ridiculous.

24:18.699 --> 24:20.365
It looked like-
looked like a little helmet.

24:20.367 --> 24:22.000
- It's on safari.
- A little turtle.

24:22.002 --> 24:24.269
You recognize these?

24:24.271 --> 24:25.771
You should.

24:25.773 --> 24:28.607
They're your leftovers from last night.

24:31.111 --> 24:33.010
Such a waste.

24:33.012 --> 24:36.280
Every one of these, a hole
drilled in my pocket.

24:36.282 --> 24:38.249
Abandoning a baby I can understand,

24:38.251 --> 24:39.884
but this, what you got here,

24:39.886 --> 24:41.619
this-this is a fucking sin.

24:41.621 --> 24:43.220
I'm done with the open bar.

24:43.222 --> 24:44.956
You pay for what you drink

24:44.958 --> 24:46.524
or half drink.

24:46.526 --> 24:48.760
First two drinks, half price...
comic prices...

24:48.762 --> 24:50.293
after that, you're on your own.

24:50.295 --> 24:52.262
Any complaints? You know
where to send them.

24:52.264 --> 24:53.964
This some sort of
punishment for last night?

24:53.966 --> 24:55.131
Course not, Billy.

24:55.133 --> 24:57.367
Just the price of doing business.

24:59.805 --> 25:01.772
There you go. There you go!

25:01.774 --> 25:03.574
Hey, Rem, what do you think's harder?

25:03.576 --> 25:05.041
Lifting that pallet of carburetors

25:05.043 --> 25:06.542
or Lyle's rod while he watches?

25:06.544 --> 25:08.744
Jerk-off.

25:10.448 --> 25:11.714
Mr. Spugozi.

25:11.716 --> 25:13.883
Sullivan. Come in.

25:13.885 --> 25:15.384
What are you reading there?

25:15.386 --> 25:17.319
<i>New York Times.</i> What's it look like?

25:17.321 --> 25:18.488
All the news that's tits to print.

25:19.557 --> 25:21.457
Uh, speaking of non-sequiturs,

25:21.459 --> 25:23.258
um, any chance you could squeeze me in

25:23.260 --> 25:24.726
a couple more hours a week?

25:24.728 --> 25:26.728
I, uh, I could come in early.

25:26.730 --> 25:28.062
You know, I believe you may be

25:28.064 --> 25:30.398
the first employee to
walk through that door

25:30.400 --> 25:32.433
asking for more work and not just

25:32.435 --> 25:34.002
more money for the same work.

25:34.004 --> 25:35.937
Hey, I'm overpaid as it is.

25:35.939 --> 25:37.906
What do I do all day
except drink your coffee

25:37.908 --> 25:40.741
and come up with new ways to
call Remi and Lyle homosexuals,

25:40.743 --> 25:43.443
which for some reason makes them laugh?

25:43.445 --> 25:45.145
You ever give sales a consideration?

25:45.147 --> 25:48.616
Sales? I-I'm not sure why I would.

25:48.618 --> 25:51.318
Sense of humor can be an
important tool in sales.

25:51.320 --> 25:53.821
David O'Brien quit so
there's an opening.

25:53.823 --> 25:55.088
That interest you?

25:55.090 --> 25:56.323
Uhh,

25:56.325 --> 25:57.790
could I still choose my hours?

25:57.792 --> 25:59.926
Not hourly. Salaried.

25:59.928 --> 26:01.594
You'd be a full-timer.

26:01.596 --> 26:04.196
Be another 60 bucks a
week, plus commission.

26:04.198 --> 26:06.032
Course there's some travel involved.

26:06.034 --> 26:09.002
You'd have to cut your
locks and wear a tie.

26:09.004 --> 26:10.469
Oh, I don't know. I don't know.

26:10.471 --> 26:13.272
I got this
whole hand-to-mouth,

26:13.274 --> 26:15.440
starving-artist thing going on.

26:15.442 --> 26:17.676
Well, you'll think about it.

26:17.678 --> 26:19.110
Got it. Yes. Okay.

26:19.112 --> 26:20.378
Uh, thank you.

26:20.380 --> 26:23.114
Thank you.

26:23.116 --> 26:24.516
How's the new baby?

26:24.518 --> 26:26.384
Uh, good.

26:26.386 --> 26:28.720
When he's not crying, he's
sleeping and shitting, so.

26:28.722 --> 26:30.055
Kids.

26:30.057 --> 26:31.989
They're a real game changer.

26:49.307 --> 26:50.640
That's some bullshit.

26:54.880 --> 26:56.179
What?

26:56.181 --> 26:58.514
Somebody crossed my
name off of open Mic.

26:59.851 --> 27:02.686
Yeah, I did.

27:02.688 --> 27:04.353
You're going up at The Cellar tonight.

27:06.523 --> 27:09.024
Ho-holy shit. Wait, tonight?

27:09.026 --> 27:10.392
What, Goldie didn't tell you?

27:10.394 --> 27:12.061
I figured she'd, uh,
whisper it in your ear

27:12.063 --> 27:14.362
while you're up at her place,
dancing cheek to cheek.

27:14.364 --> 27:15.898
Holy shit.

27:15.900 --> 27:20.002
So what happened up at her
house between you two?

27:20.004 --> 27:22.704
I helped her with some
handiwork and we ate lunch.

27:22.706 --> 27:25.339
I bet you helped her with some <i> handiwork</i>

27:25.341 --> 27:27.475
and then ate some <i> lunch.</i>

27:29.378 --> 27:30.912
Wow.

27:30.914 --> 27:32.880
Wow, that-that's the
joke that you choose?

27:32.882 --> 27:36.084
Out of all the other jokes, you
chose that one and thought,

27:36.086 --> 27:37.251
"This will show him."

27:37.253 --> 27:38.219
Yeah.

27:38.221 --> 27:40.186
"This'll do it."

27:40.188 --> 27:41.622
What time is my set?

27:41.624 --> 27:43.690
Eight thirty, right after
Steve the ventriloquist.

27:43.692 --> 27:44.691
Who's that?

27:44.693 --> 27:48.394
Relax. You'll like him.

27:48.396 --> 27:49.763
<i> Jeez, Sull,
you're already in the hole</i>

27:49.765 --> 27:51.231
<i>to me for 200.</i>

27:51.233 --> 27:52.599
Trust me, I'd fucking give anything

27:52.601 --> 27:54.267
if it were the other way around.

27:54.269 --> 27:56.636
<i>Mary wants Donnie to
go to private school.</i>

27:56.638 --> 27:58.771
Third grade, she's already
talking about colleges.

27:58.773 --> 28:00.539
<i>Well, we slept with the
baby in the car last night</i>

28:00.541 --> 28:02.141
'cause it was cooler
than this fat lady's

28:02.143 --> 28:04.110
ass crack of an apartment.

28:04.112 --> 28:05.811
<i>It's always a dick-measuring contest.</i>

28:05.813 --> 28:07.446
Look, my birthday is next month.

28:07.448 --> 28:08.948
You could think of it
as an early present.

28:08.950 --> 28:11.617
Mary already bought you
personalized stationery

28:11.619 --> 28:12.652
and a fountain pen.

28:12.654 --> 28:14.285
Are you serious?

28:14.287 --> 28:16.621
<i>Yeah. Oh, and sealing wax.</i>

28:16.623 --> 28:18.289
So we can write to each other.

28:18.291 --> 28:19.891
<i>What? Who the fuck are we,</i>

28:19.893 --> 28:21.425
<i>Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald?</i>

28:21.427 --> 28:23.662
- I know.
- <i>Oh, man.</i>

28:23.664 --> 28:24.763
You tell her I'm looking forward to

28:24.765 --> 28:26.665
that powdered wig at Christmas.

28:28.735 --> 28:30.568
<i>How much you need?</i>

28:30.570 --> 28:32.302
Eighty?

28:32.304 --> 28:34.571
How much you really need?

28:34.573 --> 28:35.906
<i>Sixty.</i>

28:39.145 --> 28:41.011
All right, I'll send it tomorrow.

28:41.013 --> 28:42.746
But that's all I got.

28:42.748 --> 28:44.247
<i>I love you like a brother,</i>

28:44.249 --> 28:46.984
<i>but the wife loves you
like a brother-in-law.</i>

28:46.986 --> 28:49.152
Well, hey, you can expect a very fancy,

28:49.154 --> 28:51.220
personalized thank-you letter
in about a month and a half.

28:51.222 --> 28:52.722
You ever call that contact I gave you?

28:52.724 --> 28:54.456
I can't keep doing this.

28:54.458 --> 28:57.393
<i>Yeah, he-he built sets
for</i> My Three Sons.

28:57.395 --> 29:00.362
<i>Not quite the world
beater you think he is.</i>

29:00.364 --> 29:02.699
So no prospects at all?

29:02.701 --> 29:05.133
<i>No. Nothing.</i>

29:09.073 --> 29:11.039
Does Sparky seem a little off to you?

29:11.041 --> 29:13.541
He seems like a 15-year-old dog, Dad.

29:13.543 --> 29:16.244
Let's say we go to Mann's
Chinese later, huh?

29:16.246 --> 29:19.247
You can compare your hands
with Douglas Fairbanks Jr.'s.

29:19.249 --> 29:22.016
No. It's morbid.

29:22.018 --> 29:23.818
That whole sidewalk's like

29:23.820 --> 29:26.020
a mass grave to the stars.

29:26.022 --> 29:27.521
When are you guys headed
back to Michigan?

29:27.523 --> 29:30.324
Not until Dad is
more tan than his T-shirts.

29:30.326 --> 29:31.926
Are you thick, Susan?

29:31.928 --> 29:34.762
That's his way of saying
he wants us to leave.

29:34.764 --> 29:36.663
This isn't exactly
a large apartment.

29:36.665 --> 29:38.199
It's been two weeks.

29:38.201 --> 29:40.200
Doesn't your husband miss his wife?

29:40.202 --> 29:42.668
Don't you employees miss
your warm, cuddly demeanor?

29:42.670 --> 29:44.771
You're a worse harp than
your mother, you know that?

29:44.773 --> 29:47.107
Quit asking me about work!

29:47.109 --> 29:48.708
Just stop.

29:48.710 --> 29:50.610
That's the first time
I've asked you anything.

29:50.612 --> 29:51.911
Jesus!

29:51.913 --> 29:53.012
Hey, uh,

29:53.014 --> 29:54.748
Dad,

29:54.750 --> 29:56.749
maybe now's the time to tell Bill

29:56.751 --> 30:00.518
about your exciting new opportunity.

30:00.520 --> 30:03.521
He's going into business
with Cousin Jack.

30:03.523 --> 30:06.291
He's, uh, starting a textile company.

30:06.293 --> 30:08.794
- Mainly shower curtains.
- You're leaving GM?

30:08.796 --> 30:11.463
I'm not selling goddamn shower curtains.

30:11.465 --> 30:13.197
What happened? Did he lose his job?

30:13.199 --> 30:15.366
From what I heard, it all
sounded very mutual.

30:15.368 --> 30:16.634
You were there for 30 years.

30:16.636 --> 30:20.138
Thirty-one.

30:20.140 --> 30:21.372
What?

30:21.374 --> 30:23.307
I don't control OPEC.

30:23.309 --> 30:24.642
I don't set the rates.

30:24.644 --> 30:26.744
They are fixing oil prices!

30:26.746 --> 30:28.813
- Who-who's...
- What do you mean, "Who?"

30:28.815 --> 30:31.381
The A-rabs and the Japs, that's who.

30:31.383 --> 30:33.549
The Japs want high fuel prices

30:33.551 --> 30:36.619
so they can murder Detroit
with their gas-sipping Hondas

30:36.621 --> 30:38.889
and their tin can Corollas.

30:38.891 --> 30:42.959
Jesus, crack open a friggin'
paper once in a while.

30:42.961 --> 30:45.061
It's a conspiracy.

30:47.832 --> 30:51.633
I'm sorry, Dad. I didn't know.

30:51.635 --> 30:53.903
Yeah, well,

30:53.905 --> 30:55.838
Detroit'll bounce back.

30:55.840 --> 30:58.473
They can't kill our
quality and innovation.

30:58.475 --> 31:00.509
Fucking samurais.

31:04.147 --> 31:07.581
It's easy to be sad in Michigan.

31:07.583 --> 31:10.418
It's so Grey there.

31:10.420 --> 31:12.620
You inviting us out was a godsend.

31:12.622 --> 31:14.823
I just thought if Dad could

31:14.825 --> 31:17.091
spend some time with the
sunshine and palm trees...

31:17.093 --> 31:21.028
Can we please stop talking about me now?

31:27.937 --> 31:30.204
Judy Elder's headlining tonight.

31:30.206 --> 31:31.438
I can get us passes.

31:31.440 --> 31:33.373
Oh, Dad, you like Judy Elder.

31:33.375 --> 31:35.042
- You think she's funny.
- I do?

31:35.044 --> 31:38.010
Yeah, you and Mom have one
of her, uh, party albums.

31:38.012 --> 31:41.280
Right. Of course.

31:41.282 --> 31:43.382
But she's no Dionne Warwick.

31:48.857 --> 31:51.224
Hey, you, uh, Steve the ventriloquist?

31:51.226 --> 31:52.725
What gave it away?

31:52.727 --> 31:54.126
Ha, yeah, yeah.

31:54.128 --> 31:56.194
What's up? I-I-I'm Adam Proteau.

31:56.196 --> 31:57.628
I'm following you in The Cellar tonight.

31:57.630 --> 31:58.730
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

31:58.732 --> 32:00.498
Oh, it's nice to meet you, Adam.

32:00.500 --> 32:02.533
Uh, and this is Sam. Uh, say hi, Sam.

32:02.535 --> 32:04.502
Hello, Mr. Proteau.

32:04.504 --> 32:06.804
Pleasure to make your acquaintance.

32:06.806 --> 32:08.340
So where'd you two guys meet?

32:08.342 --> 32:09.807
Pittsburgh, yeah.

32:09.809 --> 32:12.209
Got him for my, uh, my 12th birthday.

32:12.211 --> 32:13.477
Been together since.

32:13.479 --> 32:14.912
- No shit?
- Yeah.

32:14.914 --> 32:16.146
I got a cousin in Pittsburgh.

32:16.148 --> 32:18.349
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, yeah.

32:18.351 --> 32:20.384
So what's your, um, what's your gist?

32:20.386 --> 32:24.321
You mean, what's my jive?

32:24.323 --> 32:26.891
No, like, what-what's your act about?

32:26.893 --> 32:29.325
Oh, yeah, it's, uh, mainly
observational humor

32:29.327 --> 32:32.095
about, uh, cultural
differences, like, uh...

32:32.097 --> 32:34.497
Did you see
<i>Planet of the Apes?</i>

32:34.499 --> 32:35.865
Well, yeah, it's a-a good movie,

32:35.867 --> 32:37.200
- actually.
- Hmm.

32:37.202 --> 32:39.835
Did it make you homesick?

32:39.837 --> 32:40.836
Excuse me?

32:40.838 --> 32:42.205
Be honest.

32:42.207 --> 32:43.606
Do you really still think your father

32:43.608 --> 32:45.574
went out for a pack of cigarettes?

32:45.576 --> 32:46.541
I'm sorry, hey.

32:46.543 --> 32:48.543
I-I'm... he says some

32:48.545 --> 32:50.112
outrageous shit sometimes.

32:50.114 --> 32:51.846
But you said it. You the dummy.

32:51.848 --> 32:53.215
Am I?

32:53.217 --> 32:54.749
Is the author writing the character

32:54.751 --> 32:56.451
or the character writing the author?

32:56.453 --> 32:57.920
Be careful, Steve.

32:57.922 --> 32:59.554
He looks mad.

32:59.556 --> 33:02.391
And blacks are genetically
more prone to violence

33:02.393 --> 33:04.425
than any other mammal.

33:04.427 --> 33:06.294
I read that in a book about dogs.

33:06.296 --> 33:07.962
Whoa.

33:07.964 --> 33:09.897
See, now we're about to
have a fucking problem.

33:09.899 --> 33:11.933
Okay, listen, it's gonna
be hard to defend you

33:11.935 --> 33:14.101
if you, uh, you prove his point.

33:14.103 --> 33:15.403
Careful, Steve.

33:15.405 --> 33:17.138
He's got a gun.

33:17.140 --> 33:20.273
I mean, statistically speaking!

33:20.275 --> 33:22.075
Hey-hey-hey-hey!

33:22.077 --> 33:23.709
Knock it the fuck off or
I'll bounce you out of here!

33:23.711 --> 33:25.711
They always lunge for the dummy.

33:25.713 --> 33:27.280
What the fuck are you thinking?

33:27.282 --> 33:29.649
I'm not following that
cracker puppet motherfucker.

33:29.651 --> 33:31.051
It's his act!

33:31.053 --> 33:32.285
You seen <i>All in the Family?</i>

33:32.287 --> 33:33.886
The doll is Archie Bunker.

33:33.888 --> 33:35.621
No, that guy's just straight-up racist.

33:35.623 --> 33:38.057
Obviously, you just don't
understand satire.

33:38.059 --> 33:41.160
Racist shit passing for
comedy isn't satire.

33:41.162 --> 33:42.627
That's... there's intent there.

33:42.629 --> 33:43.963
Ooh, hey, Huey Newton,

33:43.965 --> 33:45.331
you don't have to go up at all tonight.

33:45.333 --> 33:46.966
I'd honestly understand if you didn't.

33:46.968 --> 33:48.667
My grandparents are from Tuskegee.

33:48.669 --> 33:50.970
I know why the caged bird sings.

33:50.972 --> 33:54.339
Goldie here?

33:54.341 --> 33:55.806
You know, you put up
some shelves for her.

33:55.808 --> 33:57.741
You didn't save her from drowning.

33:57.743 --> 33:59.277
I'm not pulling his act.

34:02.315 --> 34:03.514
You're welcome.

34:07.487 --> 34:09.286
So does it sound like it's telling me

34:09.289 --> 34:10.754
to go fuck myself?

34:10.755 --> 34:12.155
Your first problem is that

34:12.157 --> 34:13.822
there's over 200,000 miles on it.

34:13.824 --> 34:16.525
Believe it or not, I bought it new.

34:16.527 --> 34:20.097
It's like a fourth kid,
only it eats twice as much.

34:20.099 --> 34:22.866
You have three kids?

34:22.868 --> 34:24.467
In three different time zones.

34:24.469 --> 34:25.768
I have a newborn.

34:25.770 --> 34:26.668
Boy or girl?

34:26.670 --> 34:27.871
Uh, don't know yet.

34:27.873 --> 34:30.106
We haven't taken the diaper off.

34:30.108 --> 34:31.206
Should use that.

34:31.208 --> 34:33.675
Ah, three kids.

34:33.677 --> 34:35.177
Three adults.

34:35.179 --> 34:37.279
Goes by fast.

34:37.281 --> 34:41.150
This is where you tell me, uh,
to cherish the moment, right?

34:41.152 --> 34:42.551
'Cause so far it's been nothing

34:42.553 --> 34:46.286
but screaming and shitting and puking.

34:46.289 --> 34:48.688
You'll look back fondly when it's all

34:48.690 --> 34:51.458
bitching, borrowing, and blaming.

34:51.460 --> 34:53.027
But all three went to college,

34:53.030 --> 34:56.297
so it sounds a little
more eloquent than that.

34:56.299 --> 35:00.068
All right, you have a
flooded carburetor.

35:00.070 --> 35:02.736
So we're gonna let
that sit for a second.

35:02.738 --> 35:05.406
That's so impressive.

35:05.408 --> 35:07.041
What does your husband do?

35:07.043 --> 35:10.044
With him, it's less about
what and more about who.

35:10.046 --> 35:11.478
But to his credit,

35:11.480 --> 35:13.680
he always remembers their birthdays.

35:13.682 --> 35:15.315
Every year he sends
each one of them a card

35:15.317 --> 35:17.684
with five bucks inside and a photo

35:17.686 --> 35:20.819
of the most recent alcoholic
waitress he's banging.

35:22.157 --> 35:24.057
Well, your kids must appreciate it.

35:24.059 --> 35:25.591
All the sacrifices you made.

35:25.593 --> 35:27.493
Come on.

35:27.495 --> 35:29.095
What?

35:29.097 --> 35:31.264
I've sung that lullaby.
It's a lot of malarky.

35:31.266 --> 35:32.698
And you know it.

35:32.700 --> 35:34.167
Kids grew up without a mother

35:34.169 --> 35:37.169
so she could bask in the
adoration of strangers.

35:37.171 --> 35:39.571
We don't suffer for our art.

35:39.573 --> 35:40.872
We love it.

35:42.742 --> 35:45.377
People that love us,

35:45.379 --> 35:47.279
they're the ones that do the suffering.

35:50.217 --> 35:51.883
He just doesn't get it.

35:51.885 --> 35:53.551
Norman Lear's got three Emmys.

35:53.553 --> 35:55.018
It's called social satire.

35:55.020 --> 35:56.887
Welcome to my world!

35:56.889 --> 35:58.556
You can't talk to those people

35:58.558 --> 36:00.124
unless you got a fire hose in one hand

36:00.126 --> 36:01.725
and a German Shepherd in the other.

36:01.727 --> 36:03.694
They don't get what I do.

36:03.696 --> 36:06.397
I say what everybody thinks.

36:06.399 --> 36:09.467
You know, it's society
that throws its voice

36:09.469 --> 36:10.733
through me.

36:11.936 --> 36:15.205
Jazz and syphilis experiments.

36:15.207 --> 36:17.240
Should have picked our
own fucking cotton.

36:19.578 --> 36:20.943
I gotta pee.

36:20.945 --> 36:23.446
I like your shoes.

36:24.416 --> 36:25.715
So my doctor tells me

36:25.717 --> 36:27.583
I'm a heart attack waiting to happen.

36:27.585 --> 36:29.451
So I says to him, I says, "Doc,

36:29.453 --> 36:31.487
if I'm waiting as long
for the heart attack

36:31.489 --> 36:33.222
as I was to get in here to see you,

36:33.224 --> 36:34.556
I'm all right with that!"

36:37.060 --> 36:38.627
Why is it that people
laugh at everything

36:38.629 --> 36:40.562
that comes out of a fat comic's mouth?

36:40.564 --> 36:42.097
Present company excluded.

36:42.099 --> 36:43.965
That could be you up there,

36:43.967 --> 36:45.766
but you sold your soul

36:45.768 --> 36:48.436
for a pocket full of shrimp
and some finger sandwiches.

36:48.438 --> 36:50.771
Fucking Indians got a
better deal on Manhattan.

36:50.773 --> 36:52.940
'Cause when I step
off the city bus every day,

36:52.942 --> 36:55.776
it tips over and bursts into flames!

36:58.581 --> 37:00.148
It's true.

37:00.150 --> 37:01.481
He's that fat.

37:03.185 --> 37:04.851
Oh, come on, Edgar.

37:42.121 --> 37:43.388
I say we take the high road

37:43.390 --> 37:45.056
and just beat the shit out of him.

37:45.058 --> 37:46.724
My uncle always
says you can beat the shit

37:46.726 --> 37:48.493
out of somebody, but not the stupid.

37:48.495 --> 37:50.461
Ahh. You know how most people say

37:50.463 --> 37:53.397
- what goes around comes around?
- Mm-hmm.

37:53.399 --> 37:55.365
Well, my mother used to say,

37:55.367 --> 37:58.802
if that takes too long, just
step on his fucking glasses.

37:58.804 --> 38:00.637
Your mama sound dangerous.

38:00.639 --> 38:03.139
She is. She is.

38:03.141 --> 38:05.409
<i> You know what? I wanted
to apologize to everyone.</i>

38:05.411 --> 38:07.043
I'm sorry about all those fire trucks

38:07.045 --> 38:08.212
you saw on the way here.

38:08.214 --> 38:10.580
I actually burned my bra last week

38:10.582 --> 38:12.081
and it's still going.

38:15.320 --> 38:16.552
I had a breast exam the other day.

38:16.554 --> 38:18.487
They found the Lindbergh baby.

38:20.057 --> 38:21.757
Oh, yeah, yeah.

38:21.759 --> 38:23.992
Told the doctor that I
wanted to breast-feed,

38:23.994 --> 38:26.695
and, uh, he said, "Great!

38:26.697 --> 38:28.062
I take lunch at one."

38:30.166 --> 38:32.100
Now, that's how to tell a joke.

38:32.102 --> 38:34.001
Boys just ain't hungry.
I'll tell you that much.

38:34.003 --> 38:36.938
Is she really an acquaintance of yours?

38:36.940 --> 38:37.772
- Judy?
- Yeah?

38:37.774 --> 38:39.241
Uh-huh.

38:39.243 --> 38:42.277
Do you think you could
introduce us after the show?

38:42.279 --> 38:44.878
Your mother'd get a big kick out of it.

38:44.880 --> 38:46.747
- Sure thing, Pop.
- I actually think

38:46.749 --> 38:48.949
the last man ever to look
me straight in the eyes...

38:48.951 --> 38:50.951
Excuse me. Ladies room.

38:50.953 --> 38:52.219
I don't know if you noticed,

38:52.221 --> 38:55.356
but I happen to be a 36 triple.

38:55.358 --> 38:57.725
Are you fucking kidding me?

38:57.727 --> 39:00.793
You know, the titties
aren't even that big.

39:00.795 --> 39:01.794
You know, someone asked me...

39:01.796 --> 39:03.696
- See that?
- Hmm?

39:03.698 --> 39:05.531
If I ever turn into her,

39:05.533 --> 39:07.233
do me a favor and kill me.

39:07.235 --> 39:08.801
No, I'm not kidding.

39:08.803 --> 39:10.136
Shoot me between the eyes,

39:10.138 --> 39:11.537
stuff me in a duffel bag,

39:11.539 --> 39:13.473
and toss me in a reservoir.

39:13.475 --> 39:14.807
Hey, Cassie,

39:14.809 --> 39:16.876
just shut the fuck up.

39:16.878 --> 39:18.310
They were telling
me that their husbands

39:18.312 --> 39:20.579
actually have names for their schlongs.

39:20.581 --> 39:22.381
What do you call a dog with no legs?

39:22.383 --> 39:23.782
Nothing, no matter what you call him,

39:23.784 --> 39:25.083
he ain't coming.

39:26.920 --> 39:28.420
Where the fuck is he?

39:28.422 --> 39:29.655
Who?

39:29.657 --> 39:31.222
My act! Sam! Who do you think?

39:31.224 --> 39:32.891
Oh, I, uh, I think I saw him

39:32.893 --> 39:34.892
in the janitor's closet
flirting with a mop handle.

39:34.894 --> 39:36.294
Yeah, you know, I heard him

39:36.296 --> 39:37.328
tell somebody that he really liked you.

39:37.330 --> 39:38.729
He just kind of wanted to feel

39:38.731 --> 39:40.331
other men's hands up his ass.

39:40.333 --> 39:42.166
Hey-hey-hey! No fucking around!

39:42.168 --> 39:43.768
If one of you guys stole it,
just fucking come clean

39:43.770 --> 39:45.303
or you'll own it later.

39:45.305 --> 39:46.771
Which one of you took him?

39:46.773 --> 39:48.639
Sam was a $60 dummy.

39:48.641 --> 39:51.341
That's expensive dollcraft!

39:51.343 --> 39:53.343
If I did it, I would want credit.

39:53.345 --> 39:55.312
Shit, not me.
That's too obvious.

39:55.314 --> 39:57.113
Look, man, we don't have
your dummy, all right?

39:57.115 --> 39:58.648
So other than "you're fucked"
there's not a lot more

39:58.650 --> 40:00.082
we can add to this conversation.

40:00.084 --> 40:02.151
Did you say "dollcraft"?

40:02.153 --> 40:03.820
Give it up for

40:03.822 --> 40:05.422
The Cellar's second-favorite
ventriloquist,

40:05.424 --> 40:09.591
Steve Gileski and his
little buddy, Sam Bowie.

40:09.593 --> 40:11.960
Subtle, huh?

40:13.497 --> 40:15.464
- Hey.
- Steve, you're up.

40:15.466 --> 40:17.633
How am I up without my fucking act?

40:17.635 --> 40:20.202
What am I gonna do? They called you up.

40:20.204 --> 40:22.504
All right. Tell Fitzy to vamp.

40:22.506 --> 40:25.006
- Uh, excuse me.
- I'ma check the shitter again.

40:25.008 --> 40:26.374
Nice hair.

40:29.379 --> 40:32.647
Hey, uh, can I borrow that for a bit?

40:32.649 --> 40:35.216
You mind? Thank you so much.

40:35.218 --> 40:36.551
Cheers.

40:41.190 --> 40:43.490
Great. Dead air and no one onstage.

40:53.635 --> 40:55.635
Hey, everybody, I'm Steve Gileski

40:55.637 --> 40:57.504
and I'm a racist prick.

40:58.807 --> 41:00.339
Thank you.

41:00.341 --> 41:02.541
Thank you. I just...

41:02.543 --> 41:06.044
No, I'm Steve Gileski,
and I'm a racist prick.

41:09.149 --> 41:11.717
And I'm your host, Adam
Proteau, and welcome to

41:11.719 --> 41:13.886
<i>You Bet Your Life I'm a Racist Prick.</i>

41:17.424 --> 41:20.358
All right, now, you both are
big-time racists, right?

41:20.360 --> 41:21.993
- That's right, Adam.
- Oh, tremendous racist, Adam.

41:21.995 --> 41:22.994
- You know it.
- Go whites.

41:22.996 --> 41:24.095
You got that right.

41:26.199 --> 41:27.399
Perfect.

41:27.401 --> 41:28.366
All right, racist number one...

41:28.368 --> 41:29.401
Yes.

41:29.403 --> 41:31.035
A Jew, a Mexican, and a Negro

41:31.037 --> 41:31.936
all walk into a bar.

41:31.938 --> 41:33.504
- Wow.
- Quickly.

41:33.506 --> 41:35.773
Who's the first one that
you refuse service to?

41:35.775 --> 41:37.073
The Negro, Adam.

41:37.075 --> 41:38.909
Well, why is that?

41:38.911 --> 41:41.111
Uh, you know, no particular reason,

41:41.113 --> 41:42.913
just he's-he's black,

41:42.915 --> 41:44.915
I got a daughter, that kind of thing.

41:44.917 --> 41:47.217
No, no.

41:47.219 --> 41:48.685
Wow.

41:48.687 --> 41:51.554
Hatred based purely upon
skin color and stereotypes

41:51.556 --> 41:54.256
perpetuated by ignorance and fear?

41:54.258 --> 41:55.257
Absolutely.

41:55.259 --> 41:56.893
That's correct!

41:58.930 --> 42:01.464
Contestant number one,
you get ten points!

42:01.466 --> 42:02.565
- Hey!
- Whoa!

42:02.567 --> 42:03.966
Very good.

42:03.968 --> 42:05.735
Thank you, Adam.

42:05.737 --> 42:07.136
Uh, I'd hug you right
now, but you're a threat

42:07.138 --> 42:08.537
to my family and my way of life.

42:08.539 --> 42:09.471
Sure, sure.

42:09.473 --> 42:10.639
This is true.

42:10.641 --> 42:13.308
All right, racist number two...

42:13.310 --> 42:16.044
Uh, a kike, a coon, a
dago, and a spic, Adam.

42:16.046 --> 42:17.546
That's correct!

42:19.282 --> 42:21.450
Yeah, yeah.

42:21.452 --> 42:23.117
Hold on, what was the question?

42:23.119 --> 42:24.385
Who the fuck cares?

42:24.387 --> 42:25.953
That was serious racist
shit right there.

42:25.955 --> 42:27.120
Doesn't matter, doesn't matter.

42:27.122 --> 42:29.824
Ten points for contestant number two!

42:31.393 --> 42:32.993
Ten points!

42:38.634 --> 42:40.300
Whoa, guys!

42:40.302 --> 42:42.435
You were really hitting
the high notes out there.

42:42.437 --> 42:45.171
Ha! It was like taking a hot
bath in a crowded room.

42:45.173 --> 42:48.107
I said it went well. No one's
calling you Cleopatra.

42:48.109 --> 42:49.075
You want a topper?

42:49.077 --> 42:50.810
Ehh, nah, nah.

42:50.812 --> 42:52.144
It'll make me too sleepy.

42:53.615 --> 42:55.648
I don't like the hours you're keeping.

42:55.650 --> 42:58.117
You're gonna drive your car off
of the road one of these days.

42:58.119 --> 43:00.118
Your daughter needs you alive

43:00.120 --> 43:01.620
when you walk her down the aisle.

43:01.622 --> 43:03.856
Tell her fiancé that.

43:07.628 --> 43:10.929
You, uh, do me a favor?

43:10.931 --> 43:13.331
Yeah. What's up?

43:13.333 --> 43:16.367
Take tomorrow night off, huh?

43:16.369 --> 43:18.970
Go... be with the family.

43:18.972 --> 43:20.505
I'll pay you as if you were here.

43:22.108 --> 43:25.109
Thanks, but... I'll be okay.

43:27.179 --> 43:30.214
I wish someone would write me a
check just for looking pretty.

43:33.852 --> 43:35.151
What?

43:38.857 --> 43:41.558
Is that what this is?

43:44.295 --> 43:46.062
Look.

43:46.064 --> 43:49.298
This just isn't your crowd.

43:49.300 --> 43:50.666
What?

43:50.668 --> 43:52.401
They were laughing.

43:52.403 --> 43:53.903
Uh, some of them.

43:53.905 --> 43:57.806
Did... and each one of
them bought two drinks.

43:57.808 --> 44:00.809
You built a brand that works in Vegas.

44:00.811 --> 44:03.378
Be proud of that.

44:03.380 --> 44:05.213
LA's a younger crowd.

44:05.215 --> 44:07.582
These kids, they don't
get you like I get you.

44:07.584 --> 44:09.517
Th-they want new. They want what's next.

44:10.554 --> 44:11.419
"They," huh?

44:11.421 --> 44:12.687
Yeah.

44:15.025 --> 44:17.358
I used to push you in the pool.

44:17.360 --> 44:19.727
Oh, you say that like
you taught me to swim.

44:26.769 --> 44:29.736
This is the place.

44:29.738 --> 44:31.705
This is it.

44:31.707 --> 44:33.740
Do you want me to die in Vegas?

44:33.742 --> 44:35.208
Or Joliet?

44:35.210 --> 44:39.546
Or on some riverboat
cemented to the dock?

44:39.548 --> 44:43.849
I got no one else to
call, Goldie, only you.

44:43.851 --> 44:46.953
It's here...

44:46.955 --> 44:48.454
or I'm glue.

44:50.725 --> 44:53.793
I'm trying to do you a favor.

44:53.795 --> 44:57.429
I'm trying to let you walk home
in your heels and your fur.

44:57.431 --> 45:00.164
Before you embarrass yourself.

45:02.102 --> 45:04.402
Is it always just business
with you, Goldie?

45:07.808 --> 45:09.774
I thought we were friends.

45:09.776 --> 45:11.009
Ohh.

45:11.011 --> 45:14.445
This is the friends part.

45:20.285 --> 45:21.418
The hell are you doing?

45:21.420 --> 45:22.620
I'm paying the bill.

45:22.622 --> 45:24.287
I'll see you and Susie out front.

45:24.289 --> 45:25.990
I got it, Dad.

45:25.992 --> 45:28.291
They charge you for drinks?
You're an employee.

45:28.293 --> 45:29.693
You're on vacation.

45:29.695 --> 45:31.261
Unemployed.

45:31.263 --> 45:34.497
Isn't that what you mean?

45:34.499 --> 45:36.165
I'm just paying for the drinks, Dad.

45:36.167 --> 45:38.001
"Vacation."

45:38.003 --> 45:41.638
What are you, some kind of
fucking smart Aleck now?

45:41.640 --> 45:44.273
What, you don't think I hear your tone?

45:44.275 --> 45:47.043
You think you're some big fucking deal.

45:47.045 --> 45:49.044
Well, listen here, Billy.

45:49.046 --> 45:52.447
I can buy and sell you ten times over,

45:52.449 --> 45:55.216
so don't you fucking forget that.

45:55.218 --> 45:56.818
Fine, do you want to pay? Pay.

45:56.820 --> 46:00.188
No. No, you go ahead, big shot.

46:00.190 --> 46:02.624
Why don't you buy the
whole joint a round?

46:05.529 --> 46:07.728
You're welcome.

46:15.571 --> 46:18.839
Say what you just said.

46:42.096 --> 46:44.262
Anyone got cables?

46:44.264 --> 46:45.931
Yeah, I got some.

46:45.933 --> 46:48.500
You're a prince.

46:54.441 --> 46:56.241
Bum one of those?

46:56.243 --> 46:58.342
Sure.

47:05.719 --> 47:07.218
So who raised you?

47:07.220 --> 47:08.686
What?

47:08.688 --> 47:11.756
If your parents died,
then who raised you?

47:11.758 --> 47:13.024
My uncle.

47:17.262 --> 47:20.430
I liked your set the other night.

47:20.432 --> 47:23.033
Well, I think you're in the minority.

47:23.035 --> 47:26.870
What, are you waiting for a consensus?

47:26.872 --> 47:28.471
No, I'm not.

47:28.473 --> 47:30.440
Good.

47:30.442 --> 47:33.075
You tell ten people a baby died,

47:33.077 --> 47:35.077
they all cry.

47:35.079 --> 47:37.046
You tell ten people a joke?

47:37.048 --> 47:39.381
Four laugh, four don't,

47:39.383 --> 47:41.150
and two don't get it.

47:41.152 --> 47:43.418
Just the way it is.

47:43.420 --> 47:46.155
Right now, I'd kill for those odds.

47:46.157 --> 47:48.489
Ah, skinned knees.

47:48.491 --> 47:51.392
It's all part of the game.

47:51.394 --> 47:54.328
Come on, you're tough.

47:57.333 --> 47:59.433
A hundred years from now,

47:59.435 --> 48:01.903
people are still gonna be
listening to Beethoven

48:01.905 --> 48:03.938
and ooh'ing over Michelangelo,

48:03.940 --> 48:06.606
reading Shakespeare.

48:06.608 --> 48:07.975
But us?

48:07.977 --> 48:11.078
Jokes and shoulders, that's what we are.

48:11.080 --> 48:12.980
Yeah. Jokes for people to laugh at

48:12.982 --> 48:15.983
and shoulders for...

48:15.985 --> 48:19.920
comics down the road to stand on.

48:19.922 --> 48:21.821
Fuck posterity.

48:24.125 --> 48:26.292
You gotta push that envelope.

48:26.294 --> 48:29.262
You got to shove it down
their fucking throats.

48:29.264 --> 48:31.330
That's how you make your mark.

48:32.700 --> 48:34.200
We're just a faint echo

48:34.202 --> 48:37.503
in a joke told a hundred years from now.

48:37.505 --> 48:39.637
Trust me, I am not whining.

48:41.708 --> 48:43.508
We get something better.

48:45.179 --> 48:46.812
We get the moment.

48:46.814 --> 48:49.714
You know, we get the right fucking now.

48:56.355 --> 48:58.289
I liked your set too.

49:01.527 --> 49:04.561
Baloney.

49:04.563 --> 49:06.030
Hey, did you find any?

49:07.133 --> 49:09.033
Hold your fucking horses.

49:09.035 --> 49:10.667
Unbelievable.

49:30.687 --> 49:34.256
Toyota-loving cunt.

49:34.258 --> 49:36.558
- Little bits of it.
- Oh, yeah!

49:36.560 --> 49:38.727
Oh, Bill, just so you know,

49:38.729 --> 49:40.428
if you would like to pay the tab,

49:40.430 --> 49:41.930
I promise not to get pissed at you.

49:41.932 --> 49:43.732
What's the age cutoff for child abuse?

49:43.734 --> 49:45.067
Is it 30?

49:45.069 --> 49:46.434
Oh, shit, then it's just regular abuse.

49:46.436 --> 49:48.202
Doesn't get anywhere near the sympathy.

49:48.204 --> 49:49.737
Yeah, there's no adorable
spokesperson, is there?

49:49.739 --> 49:51.705
When I was ten, my dad
beat me with a soup ladle

49:51.707 --> 49:54.041
because I said that Eisenhower
walked like a lady.

49:54.043 --> 49:55.910
In the middle of it, he
had an asthma attack

49:55.912 --> 49:57.578
and my mom took over.

49:57.580 --> 49:59.847
The really sad part is my mother
was a registered Democrat.

50:01.017 --> 50:02.416
You know, my father never hit me.

50:02.418 --> 50:03.617
Really?

50:03.619 --> 50:04.918
How did you guys celebrate Christmas?

50:04.920 --> 50:06.286
Left when I was five.

50:06.288 --> 50:07.888
That's terrible.

50:07.890 --> 50:11.091
Do you remember what you did
to make him not love you?

50:11.093 --> 50:12.692
You don't know how lucky you are, man.

50:12.694 --> 50:13.927
Listen, I ain't mad.

50:13.929 --> 50:15.262
The man did the best he could.

50:15.264 --> 50:17.230
I think you mean the least he could.

50:17.232 --> 50:18.698
Oh, like your son ain't gonna be

50:18.700 --> 50:20.433
bitching about you when he's our age?

50:20.435 --> 50:21.633
Yeah-yeah-yeah, that's why
I didn't order the fries.

50:21.635 --> 50:23.035
I'm saving up for therapy.

50:23.037 --> 50:24.569
That's smart. My dad loves fries.

50:24.571 --> 50:26.272
Come on, Bill, there's
got to be something

50:26.274 --> 50:29.775
you can point to that
your father did right.

50:29.777 --> 50:32.611
Well... I guess he
didn't hit us on Sundays

50:32.613 --> 50:34.613
'cause that's God's day, so.

50:34.615 --> 50:37.416
Come on, Bill.

50:37.418 --> 50:38.783
Uh.

50:38.785 --> 50:40.218
All right, well, we were never hungry.

50:40.220 --> 50:41.585
And, uh,

50:41.587 --> 50:43.087
there was always a roof over our head.

50:43.089 --> 50:44.755
There you go. See?

50:44.757 --> 50:47.058
Best you can do, right?

50:47.060 --> 50:48.492
Yeah.

50:48.494 --> 50:51.329
And that's all your kid can hope for.

51:00.272 --> 51:01.905
Heard-heard you wanted to see me?

51:01.907 --> 51:03.807
Come in. Shut the door.

51:15.019 --> 51:18.454
I'm very sorry to say,

51:18.456 --> 51:20.656
but Edgar Martinez is through here.

51:20.658 --> 51:21.991
Goldie...

51:21.993 --> 51:24.427
But Manny Martinez

51:24.429 --> 51:27.629
can play here any night of the week.

51:27.631 --> 51:28.797
Well, who-who's Manny?

51:28.799 --> 51:30.432
That's you.

51:30.434 --> 51:32.600
You're gonna change your name.

51:32.602 --> 51:34.936
What? But why?

51:34.938 --> 51:36.671
What do you mean, why? It's funnier.

51:36.673 --> 51:38.539
Say it.

51:38.541 --> 51:42.377
Manny Martinez.

51:42.379 --> 51:46.180
Seriously?

51:46.182 --> 51:48.449
Manny Martinez.

51:48.451 --> 51:51.051
Again.

51:51.053 --> 51:53.520
M-Manny Martinez.

51:53.522 --> 51:54.554
Again.

51:54.556 --> 51:56.690
M...

51:56.692 --> 51:58.292
Manny Martinez.

51:58.294 --> 51:59.893
Again.

52:02.998 --> 52:04.197
Manny Martinez.

52:04.199 --> 52:05.999
Yeah, see how it rolls off the tongue?

52:06.001 --> 52:07.666
Edgar and I didn't get along.

52:07.668 --> 52:09.869
He was always looking over my
shoulder for something better.

52:09.871 --> 52:12.472
But Manny?

52:12.474 --> 52:15.241
His future looks bright.

52:15.243 --> 52:17.877
Now, you're gonna go back to Teddy

52:17.879 --> 52:21.313
and tell him that Manny Martinez,

52:21.315 --> 52:23.081
formerly known as Edgar Martinez,

52:23.083 --> 52:25.750
will no longer be playing there.

52:25.752 --> 52:28.920
And when he asks you why
you changed your name,

52:28.922 --> 52:31.589
you tell him you didn't.

52:31.591 --> 52:34.159
I did.

52:34.161 --> 52:36.328
You give your schedule to Arnie.

52:36.330 --> 52:38.795
You can have any spot you want.

52:40.699 --> 52:42.099
Thank you.

52:49.275 --> 52:52.543
Oh, Manny?

52:52.545 --> 52:54.344
Yeah?

52:54.346 --> 52:56.179
Got a nice ring to it, huh?
