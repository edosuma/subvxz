15:20.160 --> 15:21.764
and shared his
thoughts with us...

15:21.920 --> 15:24.764
through that old man.

15:26.680 --> 15:28.045
Sean O'Connell.

15:28.200 --> 15:32.967
"I expect full consideration
of negative 25 for cover."

15:33.280 --> 15:34.805
"My most grand."

15:34.960 --> 15:38.328
"The quintessence of life."

15:39.680 --> 15:40.806
What is that?

15:41.600 --> 15:43.443
It means like the
fullest and most rich.

15:43.600 --> 15:45.921
Okay. So our cover will probably
be the most famous ever...

15:46.080 --> 15:49.562
because it really will have the
big quintessence of all time.

15:49.760 --> 15:52.969
Very full and so rich.

15:55.720 --> 15:57.370
So let's see
this thing. Huh?

15:57.560 --> 15:58.891
Let's see it.

15:59.040 --> 16:01.771
Can we... What am I doing up here?
What's going on?

16:01.920 --> 16:03.365
We'll receive it now
from Negative Assets.

16:03.560 --> 16:04.800
This gentleman.
The last man in.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.126

What's that?

16:06.280 --> 16:07.361
Ah, Major Tom.

16:08.200 --> 16:10.601
Can I get that?

16:13.400 --> 16:15.289
It's being processed.

16:16.160 --> 16:17.321
All right. Well,
let's do it.

16:17.480 --> 16:19.847
Let's process some quintessence.

16:20.240 --> 16:21.241

16:22.080 --> 16:23.081
Go.

16:23.680 --> 16:24.735

I do.

Yes. I am.

16:58.920 --> 17:01.764

That's a big deal.

17:01.920 --> 17:04.810
Yeah, it's... there's a...
we have a glitch.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.444

17:06.599 --> 17:08.170
I wanted to say, to you...

17:08.960 --> 17:12.885
do you maybe have an address
for Sean O'Connell?

17:13.920 --> 17:16.175
Um... It's not really
that easy with him.

17:16.200 --> 17:17.884
He moves around
so much. I don't.

17:18.040 --> 17:19.280
Yeah, he's on a freelance.

17:19.440 --> 17:22.204
I don't know where and
he doesn't have a phone.

17:22.359 --> 17:24.839
No phone? He's old school. Yeah.

17:28.079 --> 17:29.889
But, you know, why don't
I check with Peg?

17:30.040 --> 17:31.849
I know she just processed
a check for him.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.810
And we could track his pay-out maybe.
Find him that way?

17:35.400 --> 17:38.290
Cool. Very cool.
Okay.

17:38.440 --> 17:40.044
Walter.
Yes.

17:40.240 --> 17:41.526
I'm on it.

17:41.680 --> 17:42.841
Thanks.

17:43.040 --> 17:44.121
Yes. Are you coming?

17:44.360 --> 17:45.805
Yes, I'm not.

17:46.160 --> 17:48.083
Yes, I have to stay.

17:50.040 --> 17:52.520
Here's the contact sheet.

17:58.560 --> 17:59.800
What do you see?

17:59.960 --> 18:02.088
This photo cluster.
These three.

18:02.240 --> 18:03.969
They're the only printable ones.

18:04.120 --> 18:06.248
He took them around the
same time he took 25.

18:06.520 --> 18:08.966
They could give us a clue
to where Sean is.

18:09.120 --> 18:10.121
Blow them up, all right?

18:10.240 --> 18:11.241

She's gonna get back to me.

They're for work.
They magnify the...

18:47.720 --> 18:49.722
Is that 25? Can I see?

18:49.880 --> 18:50.961
That's... No.

18:51.760 --> 18:54.604
I can't quite find 25...

18:54.760 --> 18:56.285

18:56.440 --> 18:57.930
You can't find it?

18:58.080 --> 18:59.889
Yeah. That's why
I'm trying to find Sean.

19:00.040 --> 19:04.250
I'm trying to track him down
somehow with these other images.

19:05.320 --> 19:06.401
His whereabouts?

19:06.560 --> 19:07.721
Yeah.

19:09.720 --> 19:12.246
I take this class,
Writing the Mystery Novel.

19:12.920 --> 19:14.922
Anyway, they say the key
is to work backwards.

19:15.080 --> 19:18.482
You connect the clues and then
scatter them so they seem unrelated.

19:18.640 --> 19:20.404
There's like a whole
science to it.

19:21.120 --> 19:22.565
May I?
Sure.

19:23.680 --> 19:25.762
Okay. Thumb.

19:26.160 --> 19:28.766
Yeah. It's an
unknown thumb.

19:28.920 --> 19:30.843
Okay. Water?

19:32.160 --> 19:33.286
Just water, I guess?

19:33.480 --> 19:34.527
Yeah, just water.

19:34.640 --> 19:35.687
Okay.

19:35.840 --> 19:37.171

19:38.600 --> 19:41.206

But the thing with clues,
my teacher says...

19:49.600 --> 19:52.160
is you really only need one good
one, and then they'll connect...

19:52.280 --> 19:55.045
and you'll be like, "Oh, yes, of
course, unknown thumb, water..."

<i>When I lost you there,
I was saying...</i>

26:50.240 --> 26:53.244
<i>we need to beef your profile up,
make it, you know, not blank.</i>

Okay. Been there...

26:58.960 --> 26:59.961
Um...

27:00.480 --> 27:01.811
Phoenix.

27:01.960 --> 27:03.450
I forgot why.

27:03.640 --> 27:04.687
Then Nashville...

27:04.840 --> 27:06.001
but that was just
the airport on the way

27:06.120 --> 27:07.600
to Phoenix,
so I don't know if that...

27:07.640 --> 27:08.641

27:08.760 --> 27:11.889

if you work with this girl...</i>

27:12.120 --> 27:15.681
<i>why don't you just
humanly invite her out?</i>

27:15.880 --> 27:18.611
No, no, no, I'm trying to do
like a "Piña Colada Song" thing.

27:18.760 --> 27:19.921
<i>"Piña Colada Song"?</i>

27:20.080 --> 27:22.162
Yeah, you know, a guy posts
an ad, looking for a lover...

27:22.320 --> 27:23.560
and then his wife answers it...

27:23.720 --> 27:26.041
and it turns out they were soul
mates and didn't even know it...

27:26.200 --> 27:29.443
and they end up making love
in capes, or on a cape.

27:29.600 --> 27:32.251

27:41.880 --> 27:43.370
Yeah. This one's okay.
Yeah?

27:43.960 --> 27:46.008
There's a boat there, I think.

27:46.560 --> 27:48.767

Snek.

27:48.920 --> 27:50.251
Erkigsnek?
Yeah.

27:50.400 --> 27:51.526
Sounds like a real clue.

27:51.680 --> 27:53.091
Yeah, it's the boat's name.

27:53.240 --> 27:54.401

27:56.600 --> 27:58.011
Yeah. N-U.

28:29.680 --> 28:32.001

the idea of it.

01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:03.641
What's going on?

01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:07.204
They shut down two floors.

01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:10.125
Why do you look rugged?

01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:14.046
I see you.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.684
I see you!

01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:17.966
What did I say?

01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:19.565
I see you.

01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:21.564
The photograph.
Now. Let me see it.

01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:24.166
He looked it up. There's no
such thing as a silver bath.

01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:27.644
Listen, there was uncertainty
about the negative.

01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:29.680
I understood that, hopefully,
it was in Iceland.

01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:30.961
It was in your care.

01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:32.081
If you just give
me some more time...

01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:33.295
You're fired.

01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:34.695
We'll make another cover.

01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:35.721
Hey!

01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:41.891
More than a million, way more,
negatives have come through my office.

01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:43.530
I have never mislaid one.

01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:47.448
Put it on a plaque.
Hang it at your next job.

01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:50.482
Now I got to explain
this to the board?

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:54.331
Hey.

01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:57.175
Are you okay?

01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:58.690
Yeah.

01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:00.845
That's cool.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.368
It's a skateboard.
It's for Cheryl's son.

01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:07.962
Cheryl's not in.
She was let go.

01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:10.569
I told you, man, it's bad.

01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:12.165
Hey! That's my fern.

01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:14.850

01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:23.847
Yeah. She's...

01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:29.811
We work together, and she was
helping me with a work thing.

Yes, yoga.

01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:06.291
It's a class. I go to the hot
kind, where they heat the room.

01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:08.570
Have you heard of that? Sure.

01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:10.688

What's good about this is that
I just don't worry about it.

01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:26.760
I just get out of my head.

01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:28.015
Is that good for you?

01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:30.247
I feel like it's good
in a class like this.

01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:32.004
I mean, I'm not going to get
paid for it, which is fine.

01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:33.685
It's not about money.
Wonderful.

01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:35.450
And I feel like...

01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:39.571
It's just for kids, but I think it's
important for them to start early.

01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:41.320
I'm really thrilled, Mom.

01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:43.448
I think I'm just
going to enjoy it.

01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:45.443
Just standing in front
of people and talking.

01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:47.883
You'll be good at that.
Yeah.

01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:49.929
You'll really be good at that.
I think so, too, Mom.

01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:52.721

01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:57.763
Did somebody take a picture of
your piano, like, a week ago?

01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:01.366
I did.

01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:03.969
With Sean's camera.

01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:09.326
Sean O'Connell's camera?

01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:11.323
Yeah, he came to visit.

01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:13.805
Mom, what?

01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:15.975
Yeah.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.889
He wanted to know
about your work schedule,

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.968
when you left,
when you came home.

01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:22.487
He said you
really understood <i>LIFE.</i>

01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:24.409
He was really
interested in your work.

01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:28.125
Mom, why didn't you tell me?

01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:30.846
I told you. I told you
in the produce aisle.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.570
I remember that.

01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:35.207
Maybe you were...

01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:39.086
Odessa, what is it you call it when he
goes into one of his little places?

01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:40.884
"Zoned out."

01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:42.963
You do that now and then.

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:46.529
What's the matter?

01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:49.769
I got fired.

01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:52.049
I lost a picture of his.

01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:53.801
Can you find it?

01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:57.168
No, I don't know where he is.

01:16:57.320 --> 01:17:00.403
He's someplace
with warlocks or...

01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:02.970
Warlords.

01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:04.690
No, warlocks.

01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:06.684
No. Warlords.

01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:10.162
Sean said he had to meet
with warlords very soon...

01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:12.322
and maybe he would take my cake

01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:14.482
so that he could
get permission...

01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:17.041
to trek through
the wilds and places.

01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:20.044

snow leopards. How about that?

01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:33.646

01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:54.440
that you were the person
who worked the hardest...

01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:59.049
to make sure his work was
realized the way he wished.

01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:05.964

01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:49.605
I'll sit.

01:23:57.600 --> 01:23:59.443
Well, take your time.
Settle in.

01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:01.443

01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:05.490
There's a snow leopard.

01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:09.166
Right in this ridge.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:13.686
So we have to try to be very,
very, very, very still.

01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:19.326
They call the snow
leopard the "ghost cat."

01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:23.607
It never lets itself be seen.

01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:30.362
Ghost cat?

01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:47.965
Sean, there was a negative that
got separated from your roll.

01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:53.010
I'm taking a lot of
heat over it at work.

01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:57.006
It never came with the
roll that you sent.

01:24:57.160 --> 01:24:59.003
The last roll
you're talking about?

01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:00.321
Yeah.

01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:01.521
The 25.

01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:04.644

01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:12.729
Why am I sitting on it?

01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:16.049
It's in your wallet.

01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:18.928
That was the gift.

01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:20.844
The photograph.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:22.889
The wallet was just something
I could put it in.

01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:26.487
So, I put it in a little slot, the
little picture holder in there.

01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:28.330
I thought it would be cute.

01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:32.763
I told you,
"look inside."

01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:35.044
In the note.

01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:36.526
You said "look inside."

01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:39.889
I thought you meant look
inside of the wrapping paper.

01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:43.046
Yeah? Well, you got a real
nice surprise coming.

01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:45.402
No, I don't have it.

01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:47.535
I don't have it anymore.

01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:48.561
Whoa!

01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:56.408
What the hell were you thinking?

01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:01.604
I mean, I'm sorry, I've admired
you for a very long time...

01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:05.441
but that is not a good move, at
all, with a valuable negative.

01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:07.568
Sorry, I just...

01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:10.286
I thought it would be
a playful kind of thing.

01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:11.930
Playful?

01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:14.724
Too playful.

01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:17.445
I see what you're saying.

01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:20.251
With the cover, I should have
been more straightforward.

01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:23.489
But can I ask you, I mean,
if you don't mind...

01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:26.249
what did you do with the wallet?

01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:28.725
Chucked it.

01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:33.208
Well, that hurts my feelings.

01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:36.442
No. Man, I liked
it very much.

01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:37.965
I appreciated it very much.

01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:39.121
So you threw it away?

01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:46.364
So, you have no
idea what it was?

01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:48.441
The photograph?

01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:53.645

01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:51.610
I didn't look.

01:37:56.920 --> 01:37:59.002
You were a good boss, Walter.

01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:02.850
Thanks, man.

01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:22.930
<i>Hey, Walter.
What's up?</i>

01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:24.570
<i>Check this out.</i>

01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:38.086
<i>See you!</i>

01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:40.961
<i>Hi.</i>

01:39:52.240 --> 01:39:54.561
Walter Mitty.
Severance package.

01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:37.806
Hey.

01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:39.971
Cheryl.

01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:43.165
Hey.
Hey.

01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:46.286
I got that email
from Rich yesterday.

01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:47.726
He's really good.

01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:49.120
Walter, thank you.

01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:50.566
That was...

01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:53.883
That was just a really
cool thing to do.

01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:56.042
I just saw it in Iceland.

01:40:56.640 --> 01:40:57.641
He loves it.

01:40:57.800 --> 01:40:59.689
And I'm taking
him this afternoon.

01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:04.003
Hey, I wanted you to know...

01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:06.324
you weren't boring me.

01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:08.725
That day in the park.

01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:11.406
I was...

01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:13.801
I was thinking about...

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:18.164
I hope this doesn't sound weird,
but I was thinking about you.

01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:23.562
When I was in Greenland,
they do karaoke there...

01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:29.326
and I had to get on this helicopter,
with a very drunk pilot.

01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:32.851
And I started to imagine you...

01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:35.568
singing Major Tom.

01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:40.010
Anyway...

01:41:40.920 --> 01:41:43.082
it got me on the helicopter.

01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:47.365
And it got me
where I wanted to go.

01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:50.881
So, what happened to you?

01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:54.289
You sort of fell off
the face of the Earth there.

01:41:54.440 --> 01:41:55.885
For a little bit.

01:41:56.520 --> 01:41:58.682
I came by and...

01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:01.690
your husband answered so I
figured I should just go.

01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:06.402
Phil. He was
fixing my refrigerator.

01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:08.369
And he's not my husband.

01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:11.728
I guess I imagined...

01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:15.887
I thought maybe you
got back together.

01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:18.728
You have a good imagination.

01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:20.405
But no.

01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:25.566
Hey, my sister got
this role in Grease.

01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:26.926
Rizzo.

01:42:27.080 --> 01:42:29.447
Not on Broadway.
In some weird church.

01:42:32.400 --> 01:42:33.970
Do you want to go with me?

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:36.604
I made that sound
really not good.

01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:37.966
Yeah.

01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:40.080
Yeah?

01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:43.449
Yeah, yeah.
I would love to.

01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:46.444
Grease in a weird church?
Are you kidding?

01:42:46.600 --> 01:42:48.762
Rizzo, that's the best part.

01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:52.004
Yeah, Rizzo. <font color="#D900D9">(CHUCKLES)</font>
Tough and tender.

01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:53.605
Yeah.

01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:55.765
Great.

01:42:56.480 --> 01:42:58.687
Are you heading Uptown?

01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:00.415
Sure.

01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:01.441
Yeah?

01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:05.602
I actually always
related to Rizzo more.

01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:07.285
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:10.523
Was it the smoking
and the teenage sex?

01:43:10.680 --> 01:43:13.604
No. She was
just real, I guess.

01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:14.761
Oh!

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:18.163
The last issue, it should be here.
It came out this morning.

01:43:38.960 --> 01:43:41.281
Man. Walter.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.367
Should we go buy one of those?

01:44:02.520 --> 01:44:04.284
Yeah. I was
probably gonna...

01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:06.124
Probably gonna go back later?
Yeah.

01:44:06.280 --> 01:44:10.001
I just didn't want to seem
uncool and get one right away.

01:44:41.720 --> 01:44:45.167
<i>There's a rhythm

01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:43.082

01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:49.926
