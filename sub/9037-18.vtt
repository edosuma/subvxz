WEBVTT

00:03.303 --> 00:04.703
- Oooggh!

00:04.705 --> 00:06.538
- What?
What's wrong?

00:06.540 --> 00:09.141
What happened?

00:09.143 --> 00:10.642
- You kicked me.

00:12.379 --> 00:14.179
- I did?
- Ohh...

00:14.181 --> 00:17.316
Right in the garden
of good and evil.

00:25.225 --> 00:26.792
- Honey, I'm sorry.

00:28.061 --> 00:31.397
Oh.

00:31.399 --> 00:34.099
I think we found
the kicker.

00:34.101 --> 00:36.135
- What's she doing
in our bed again?

00:36.137 --> 00:40.172
It's every night.
Good god, y'all.

00:40.174 --> 00:43.175
Ohh! Ohh...

00:43.177 --> 00:46.078
- Honey, is there
anything I can do?

00:46.080 --> 00:48.447
- You can learn to love
half a man.

00:53.253 --> 00:55.120
- Ally, what are you
doing up, sweetie?

00:55.122 --> 00:56.789
- Can I sleep
in your bedroom?

00:56.791 --> 00:59.324
- No, no,
not this time, honey, okay?

00:59.326 --> 01:02.061
Look, you have
a beautiful swedish bed

01:02.063 --> 01:05.064
That took daddy three days
to put together, and...

01:05.066 --> 01:08.300
- But there's monsters
in my room.

01:08.302 --> 01:09.368
- Oh, come on.

01:09.370 --> 01:10.636
- All right,
that's okay, honey.

01:10.638 --> 01:12.104
You go ahead
and sleep in our bed.

01:12.106 --> 01:13.605
- Okay.

01:13.607 --> 01:15.441
- What'd you do that for?

01:15.443 --> 01:17.709
- She's having trouble
sleeping alone.

01:17.711 --> 01:19.278
She needs her rest.

01:19.280 --> 01:22.214
- Well, her rest?
What about my rest?

01:22.216 --> 01:24.850
- Ray, she's afraid
of monsters. Come on.

01:24.852 --> 01:27.352
- Well, I'm afraid of <i>her.</i>

01:30.824 --> 01:32.758
- What do you want
to do about it?

01:32.760 --> 01:34.860
- Well, what does
the book say?

01:34.862 --> 01:35.860
- Which book?

01:35.862 --> 01:40.632
- I don't know--
<i>how to grow a kid.</i>

01:40.634 --> 01:43.569
- They all say different things.
They're very confusing.

01:43.571 --> 01:45.504
So why don't <i>you</i> just
read the damn books?

01:45.506 --> 01:50.476
- Well, if they're
confusing for <i>you...</i>

01:50.478 --> 01:51.710
- You might like them, ray.

01:51.712 --> 01:54.379
Some of them have pictures
of breasts.

01:57.417 --> 01:59.751
- Yeah,
they're just drawings.

02:02.255 --> 02:04.456
You know,
the twins can sleep.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.191
How come they're not
afraid of monsters?

02:06.193 --> 02:07.191
- I don't know.

02:07.193 --> 02:11.630
One of 'em sleeps while
the other one's on guard duty.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.198
- I can't--I can't
do this tonight.

02:13.200 --> 02:14.666
I can't keep going
to work like this.

02:14.668 --> 02:16.368
- Yeah, well,
what about me?

02:16.370 --> 02:23.542
- What? You don't
have to w--uhhh...

02:23.544 --> 02:24.877
- What's that, ray?

02:24.879 --> 02:26.912
I don't have to
wuh-uhhh?

02:26.914 --> 02:28.614
- You see?

02:28.616 --> 02:33.519
I--I can't think clearly
with the no sleep.

02:33.521 --> 02:36.655
I'm talking
nonsense here.

02:36.657 --> 02:38.423
Of course you wuhhh.

02:42.262 --> 02:43.428
- Frank, get in here.

02:43.430 --> 02:46.665
Your eggs
are getting cold.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.433
If he thinks I'm gonna
warm them up for him,

02:48.435 --> 02:49.902
He's got another think
coming.

02:49.904 --> 02:51.170
- You tell him, ma.

02:51.172 --> 02:52.571
You're not
his slave girl.

02:52.573 --> 02:54.339
- You're damn right.

02:54.341 --> 02:56.341
- I'm here for you, ma.
- Good.

02:57.610 --> 02:59.378
- Hey.

02:59.380 --> 03:00.712
- Good morning, dear.

03:00.714 --> 03:01.813
You hungry?

03:01.815 --> 03:03.315
- No, no, no.

03:03.317 --> 03:05.584
- What's the matter?
What did you do to yourself?

03:05.586 --> 03:07.553
- My back is a little stiff,
that's all.

03:07.555 --> 03:09.755
I--I slept half off the bed
last night

03:09.757 --> 03:11.790
'cause I didn't want
to get kicked again.

03:11.792 --> 03:13.525
- Raymond...

03:13.527 --> 03:16.595
A married couple should
never go to bed angry.

03:18.698 --> 03:20.899
- Not a hard-and-fast rule
in this house.

03:23.670 --> 03:26.605
- It's not about debra and me.
It's about ally.

03:26.607 --> 03:29.341
She keeps sleeping
in our bed at night.

03:29.343 --> 03:31.743
- Monsters?

03:31.745 --> 03:33.345
- How'd you know?

03:33.347 --> 03:35.280
- Oh...I know.

03:39.752 --> 03:42.554
- Oh, now you come down, huh?

03:42.556 --> 03:44.256
Are you happy?

03:44.258 --> 03:46.792
Those eggs have been sitting
there for half an hour,

03:46.794 --> 03:49.261
And I am not
warming them up.

03:51.965 --> 03:55.434
How can you eat them?
They're stone cold.

03:55.436 --> 03:58.904
- They're fine.

03:58.906 --> 04:01.707
- Give me them!
I'm warming them up!

04:05.912 --> 04:07.713
- Ma, listen,

04:07.715 --> 04:09.448
You still got
that heating pad?

04:09.450 --> 04:10.649
- Sure we do.

04:10.651 --> 04:13.285
Robbie, get raymond
the heating pad, huh?

04:13.287 --> 04:14.886
- What?
I got a better idea.

04:14.888 --> 04:16.755
I'll crack your back.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.357
- What? No.
- Calm down.

04:18.359 --> 04:19.591
- No, get outta here.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.293
- I know what I'm doing.

04:21.295 --> 04:22.294
Take a deep breath.

04:22.296 --> 04:23.328
- Will ya let go
of me?

04:23.330 --> 04:24.563
- You're too tense.
Relax!

04:24.565 --> 04:26.598
- Aaagghh!

04:26.600 --> 04:27.598
- Robbie!

04:27.600 --> 04:30.902
You'll sever his spine.
Frank, help me.

04:33.673 --> 04:34.840
- Better?

04:37.710 --> 04:38.877
- No.

04:40.780 --> 04:42.547
- Hmm.

04:42.549 --> 04:43.749
I'll get
the heating pad.

04:48.054 --> 04:50.422
- Ray, you look awful.

04:50.424 --> 04:51.823
Toast, marie.

04:55.962 --> 04:57.929
- Well, I see you're still
clipping your toenails

04:57.931 --> 05:00.299
At the table, huh, dad?

05:02.835 --> 05:04.403
- You know something,
raymond,

05:04.405 --> 05:06.338
Maybe it's debra's cooking.

05:06.340 --> 05:08.573
That's why ally gets up
in the middle of the night,

05:08.575 --> 05:11.443
Because of the terrible
indigestion.

05:11.445 --> 05:12.978
- Ma, ally eats fine, okay?

05:12.980 --> 05:15.681
It's just we have to get her
back in her own bed, that's all.

05:15.683 --> 05:17.382
We got all the books.

05:17.384 --> 05:19.985
- Books! Ha!

05:19.987 --> 05:23.655
- I needed no books
when I was raising you kids, no.

05:23.657 --> 05:26.091
And my parents
didn't use them either.

05:26.093 --> 05:29.961
- Oh, good, I come
from a long line of illiterates.

05:31.731 --> 05:33.665
- Raymond dear,

05:33.667 --> 05:35.467
To raise children,

05:35.469 --> 05:39.071
All you need is love
and common sense.

05:39.073 --> 05:40.806
- You know, when I had
trouble sleeping,

05:40.808 --> 05:42.441
Mom used to do
something for me.

05:42.443 --> 05:44.943
Remember that, ma?
Huh?

05:44.945 --> 05:46.878
One of my best memories
growing up.

05:46.880 --> 05:50.549
She'd give me a warm cup
of that colored sugar water.

05:50.551 --> 05:53.618
Put me right out.

05:53.620 --> 05:56.021
- That was booze.

06:02.495 --> 06:04.830
- Booze?

06:04.832 --> 06:06.064
- Frank!

06:06.066 --> 06:08.100
- A stiff shot of sambuca
in there,

06:08.102 --> 06:10.669
And it was
lights out, bobby!

06:15.675 --> 06:17.409
- You gave me liquor?

06:17.411 --> 06:20.579
- Not liquor, dear.
<i>Liqueur.</i>

06:23.383 --> 06:24.549
- I don't believe it.

06:24.551 --> 06:27.386
All those special times,
they were just...

06:27.388 --> 06:29.121
- Happy hours.

06:32.125 --> 06:35.527
- Ohh, you are sick.

06:35.529 --> 06:38.397
- Oh, we were good parents!

06:38.399 --> 06:39.531
We didn't give you
cashews

06:39.533 --> 06:41.700
'cause you could choke
on them.

06:41.702 --> 06:43.435
- What's the big deal?

06:43.437 --> 06:45.504
It's not like
we let him drive that way.

06:49.509 --> 06:50.675
- All right.
I'm going to bed.

06:50.677 --> 06:51.675
- Hey, hold on, ray.

06:51.677 --> 06:53.445
I want to tell you
something about bed.

06:53.447 --> 06:55.647
- Oh, please don't.

06:55.649 --> 06:57.649
- Hey, I know
what's going on.

06:57.651 --> 06:59.117
You gotta do something.

06:59.119 --> 07:00.986
It affects the marriage.

07:00.988 --> 07:02.554
Am I wrong?

07:02.556 --> 07:03.755
- Well, uh...Whatever.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.090
- Look, I remember
what we used to do

07:05.092 --> 07:06.425
When you were a kid.

07:06.427 --> 07:07.959
- Maybe I shouldn't
hear about this.

07:07.961 --> 07:10.195
- Tough love.

07:10.197 --> 07:13.064
Every time you crawled
into our bed, I'd say,

07:13.066 --> 07:15.033
"marie, take him back!"

07:16.903 --> 07:18.837
Oh, you bawled
your little eyes out,

07:18.839 --> 07:20.472
But after a while,

07:20.474 --> 07:23.442
You got
with the program.

07:23.444 --> 07:24.543
- All right, well,
I don't think

07:24.545 --> 07:25.610
I could put ally
through that, okay?

07:25.612 --> 07:27.112
- Well, what are you gonna do?

07:27.114 --> 07:30.782
You gonna turn your girl
into a sissy?

07:30.784 --> 07:33.051
You can't coddle
your children,

07:33.053 --> 07:35.587
'cause when you
send 'em out there,

07:35.589 --> 07:38.190
They're gonna move
right back in with you.

07:40.059 --> 07:43.161
- I don't wanna hear it, ma.

07:43.163 --> 07:45.096
- It was for
your own good.

07:45.098 --> 07:46.832
- For my own good, huh?

07:46.834 --> 07:48.867
Just like the ice cream truck?
Remember that?

07:48.869 --> 07:50.602
You told me every time
the music played

07:50.604 --> 07:52.737
That meant they were
<i>out</i> of ice cream!

07:59.912 --> 08:02.914
- Sugar's not good for you.

08:02.916 --> 08:06.117
- It is the worst thing
for a hangover.

08:11.090 --> 08:13.058
- Daddy...

08:15.628 --> 08:18.263
Daddy!

08:18.265 --> 08:20.999
- [sighs] ray...

08:21.001 --> 08:23.034
- Daddy?

08:23.036 --> 08:24.870
- Ray, come on.

08:24.872 --> 08:26.972
- What?

08:26.974 --> 08:29.040
What are you
waking me up for?

08:29.042 --> 08:32.010
- Daddy!

08:32.012 --> 08:35.013
- She's calling you.
This is your plan.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.248
You have this big
"tough love" idea.

08:36.250 --> 08:37.949
You deal with her.

08:37.951 --> 08:39.684
- You're not supposed
to deal with her, okay?

08:39.686 --> 08:42.654
That's the "tough" part.

08:42.656 --> 08:45.190
Go to bed, ally!

08:45.192 --> 08:48.593
- Read me another story!

08:48.595 --> 08:50.262
- Ray.

08:50.264 --> 08:52.864
Come on!
Ray, th--

08:52.866 --> 08:54.799
How can you
do this?

08:54.801 --> 08:59.237
- Believe me, there are
worse things we could do.

08:59.239 --> 09:02.674
- [whining]
I'm hungry!

09:02.676 --> 09:04.142
- Ray, come on.
Go to her.

09:04.144 --> 09:06.244
We're never gonna get sleep
this way either.

09:06.246 --> 09:08.046
- Come on,
she's just playing us.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.215
Believe me,
this is for her own good, okay?

09:10.217 --> 09:12.951
If you coddle her now,
she'll never move out.

09:16.188 --> 09:19.090
- Helloooo!

09:19.092 --> 09:20.926
- You know,
there's a striking similarity

09:20.928 --> 09:22.627
Between
the tough-love plan

09:22.629 --> 09:26.731
And the dad-does-nothing plan.

09:26.733 --> 09:30.201
- I know; that's what
attracted me to it at first.

09:30.203 --> 09:34.005
But now I think
it all makes sense.

09:34.007 --> 09:35.707
- Mommy!

09:35.709 --> 09:36.975
- Well, not to me.

09:36.977 --> 09:38.243
Okay, honey,
I'm coming.

09:38.245 --> 09:40.645
- No, no, no, no,
you can't go, no.

09:40.647 --> 09:44.249
Look, you're gonna turn her
into a sissy, okay?

09:44.251 --> 09:46.117
You have to have
self-discipline like me.

09:46.119 --> 09:47.586
Just lay down.

09:47.588 --> 09:48.720
No. No.

09:48.722 --> 09:51.256
- Let go!

09:51.258 --> 09:52.591
- Don't bring her in here.

09:52.593 --> 09:55.660
You're gonna undo
all my work.

09:57.330 --> 09:59.297
- Okay, fine, ray.
I won't bring her in here.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.967
Mm-hmm. God forbid
we should disturb you.

10:01.969 --> 10:04.002
I'm gonna go sleep
in her room.

10:04.004 --> 10:05.036
- Oh, come on, deb.

10:05.038 --> 10:06.705
What are you--
deb!

10:06.707 --> 10:09.307
[door closes]

10:09.309 --> 10:12.143
I can't sleep by myself.

10:17.216 --> 10:19.751
[whining]
I'm hungry!

10:28.861 --> 10:30.996
- [giggling]

10:30.998 --> 10:33.898
Daddy! Daddy!
Catch me!

10:33.900 --> 10:35.400
- Ahh!

10:35.402 --> 10:37.168
You have a good
night's sleep, ally?

10:37.170 --> 10:38.837
- Yes.

10:38.839 --> 10:40.639
- Good for you.

10:45.044 --> 10:46.043
Hey.

10:46.045 --> 10:49.914
- Oh, don't even
<i>act</i> tired.

10:49.916 --> 10:51.750
- What?
I <i>am</i> tired.

10:51.752 --> 10:54.052
- [sarcastically]
ohh, poor ray,

10:54.054 --> 10:56.321
Got a queen-size bed
all to yourself.

10:56.323 --> 11:00.859
I spend the night
on the swedish rack.

11:00.861 --> 11:04.429
- Well, I couldn't sleep
without you.

11:04.431 --> 11:07.265
I've grown accustomed
to your nose whistle.

11:12.071 --> 11:18.176
- Yeah, ray, it's all about you
and how you couldn't sleep.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.811
- Hey, did you drink
from this already?

11:19.813 --> 11:20.879
- No.

11:20.881 --> 11:23.014
- Well, the top
didn't pop.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.349
- What?

11:24.351 --> 11:26.317
- Did you check it
at the supermarket?

11:26.319 --> 11:28.853
'cause the top
was popped up already.

11:28.855 --> 11:30.889
- It's fine, ray.

11:30.891 --> 11:36.761
- You gotta check 'em
when you buy 'em.

11:36.763 --> 11:40.799
- Why don't you buy them?
Then you can check 'em!

11:40.801 --> 11:42.100
- Yeah,
yeah, if I bought 'em,

11:42.102 --> 11:44.169
I wouldn't buy one
that had been tampered with.

11:44.171 --> 11:47.205
- Nobody tampered with it.
I just had some.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.808
- You just said
you didn't.

11:52.978 --> 11:53.977
- I forgot.

11:53.979 --> 11:56.114
- Well, when you opened it,
did it pop up?

11:56.116 --> 11:58.383
- I don't know!
I am tired!

12:05.357 --> 12:06.725
- I'm not drinking this.

12:06.727 --> 12:08.393
I'll wait and see
what happens to you.

12:18.370 --> 12:19.804
All right. I'm sorry.

12:19.806 --> 12:22.741
Look, don't you see
what's happening?

12:22.743 --> 12:24.309
We're hostages.

12:24.311 --> 12:29.047
She's using sleep deprivation
to break us.

12:29.049 --> 12:30.448
What are we gonna do?

12:30.450 --> 12:32.150
- "we"?

12:32.152 --> 12:34.018
There's been no <i>we</i>
<i>here, ray.</i>

12:34.020 --> 12:36.354
I've been we.
How about you be we?

12:36.356 --> 12:38.156
You sleep in ally's room
tonight.

12:38.158 --> 12:40.024
- No, I can't.

12:40.026 --> 12:42.160
- Look, she needs to sleep
with at least one of us.

12:42.162 --> 12:43.428
And tonight that's you.

12:43.430 --> 12:47.499
- I'm we <i>and</i> us
now, right?

12:47.501 --> 12:49.901
That's like
four people.

12:49.903 --> 12:51.302
- Okay, then,
why don't the four of you

12:51.304 --> 12:53.037
Help me get the kids
ready for school?

12:53.039 --> 12:54.773
- Look,

12:54.775 --> 12:57.275
About tonight...

12:57.277 --> 12:59.210
I have a big day
tomorrow.

12:59.212 --> 13:00.311
- You know what, ray?

13:00.313 --> 13:01.513
Tough...

13:01.515 --> 13:03.148
Love.

13:08.921 --> 13:10.221
- All right, honey,

13:10.223 --> 13:13.925
Now mommy went to bed
early tonight, but...

13:13.927 --> 13:16.795
We don't need mommy
to fall asleep, right?

13:16.797 --> 13:18.930
- Right.
- Okay.

13:18.932 --> 13:20.999
Good night.

13:24.203 --> 13:26.271
Good night, ma.

13:28.240 --> 13:30.008
- Good night, sweetie.

13:30.010 --> 13:31.543
We'll be okay.
We'll be fine.

13:31.545 --> 13:32.977
- Yeah, just,
you know,

13:32.979 --> 13:36.214
Keep it down, okay?

13:36.216 --> 13:39.517
- Are you sure this is gonna be
all right with debra?

13:39.519 --> 13:42.821
- Listen, she's gonna thank me
for a good night's sleep,

13:42.823 --> 13:44.088
And it'll prove to her

13:44.090 --> 13:46.357
That it doesn't have to be
one of us in here,

13:46.359 --> 13:50.962
And we have
other options, and...

13:50.964 --> 13:54.599
You gotta be out of here
by 5:00 a.M.

13:54.601 --> 13:56.968
- I-I-I'm happy to help.

13:56.970 --> 13:58.503
- Yeah, okay.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.238
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

14:00.240 --> 14:02.240
- I have to use
the bathroom.

14:02.242 --> 14:06.578
- Now? I told you to go
before you came over.

14:06.580 --> 14:09.514
- I didn't have
to go then.

14:09.516 --> 14:11.850
- Oh, great, so now
the whole plan just blows up

14:11.852 --> 14:13.852
Because you couldn't go
when you were supposed to?

14:13.854 --> 14:15.286
- I'm sorry.

14:15.288 --> 14:18.489
Can I go now,
raymond?

14:18.491 --> 14:20.124
- Oh, all right.

14:20.126 --> 14:21.960
- Thanks, raymond.

14:21.962 --> 14:24.329
- And no humming.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.310
- What are you doing?

14:39.312 --> 14:41.512
I thought you were gonna spend
the night in ally's room.

14:41.514 --> 14:43.381
- No.
No, no, it's okay.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.149
I-I-I told ally

14:45.151 --> 14:47.619
If she needs to come in
that I'm here for her,

14:47.621 --> 14:51.956
But, uh, you know, I think
my little talk did the trick,

14:51.958 --> 14:53.124
And we're gonna have

14:53.126 --> 14:55.126
A good night's sleep,
you and I.

14:56.362 --> 14:58.162
- Well, I know I am.

14:58.164 --> 15:00.064
- Okay. Good night.
- Good night.

15:01.233 --> 15:03.601
- Ohh...

15:03.603 --> 15:05.203
Ooh...

15:05.205 --> 15:07.939
Ohh...

15:17.983 --> 15:20.385
- Ray...

15:20.387 --> 15:22.320
- Huh?

15:22.322 --> 15:24.989
- Do you hear humming?

15:36.135 --> 15:37.235
- That's the pipes.

15:37.237 --> 15:39.604
It's, uh...

15:39.606 --> 15:42.340
No, that--that's outside.
That's not...

15:42.342 --> 15:45.343
You know what?
I don't hear anything.

15:45.345 --> 15:47.045
- I think it stopped.

15:47.047 --> 15:48.179
- Yeah, yeah, it stopped

15:48.181 --> 15:51.316
Because it was nothing
to begin with.

15:53.118 --> 15:55.086
- You sure that wasn't ally?

15:55.088 --> 15:57.422
- No, no, no.
She's asleep.

15:57.424 --> 15:59.590
She's asleep.
I read to her.

15:59.592 --> 16:01.626
And I--I tucked her in,

16:01.628 --> 16:04.095
You know, with the blanket
with the ruffly ruffles,

16:04.097 --> 16:08.099
And...And then
I sang to her.

16:08.101 --> 16:09.968
You know,
I sang really soft...

16:09.970 --> 16:13.237
♪ <i>frere jacques</i> ♪

16:15.541 --> 16:17.508
And it was, you know,

16:17.510 --> 16:18.710
As I'm singing to her,

16:18.712 --> 16:21.646
You could see her little eyes
were just...

16:21.648 --> 16:25.583
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:25.585 --> 16:30.254
And then she said,
"daddy, I love you."

16:30.256 --> 16:35.193
And then just...Psssshh,
off to sleepyland.

16:35.195 --> 16:38.396
- Ohh...
- Yeah.

16:38.398 --> 16:40.064
- That's so cute.

16:40.066 --> 16:42.200
- What--where are you going?

16:42.202 --> 16:43.401
- I've been so wiped out,

16:43.403 --> 16:44.635
I forgot to kiss her
good night.

16:44.637 --> 16:46.170
I'm just gonna give her
a little--

16:46.172 --> 16:47.505
- No, no, no.
Let her sleep.

16:47.507 --> 16:48.505
Let her sleep.

16:48.507 --> 16:51.109
Look, she kissed me
good night, so here--

16:51.111 --> 16:53.678
From her to me to you.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.413
Okay, come on, you don't
want to wake her.

16:55.415 --> 16:56.748
You don't want to
take that chance

16:56.750 --> 16:58.549
'cause that will spoil
everything...

16:58.551 --> 17:02.353
For you.

17:02.355 --> 17:03.688
- That's true.

17:03.690 --> 17:04.756
- Yes, yes,
that's true.

17:04.758 --> 17:06.491
I'm very true.

17:11.196 --> 17:12.330
- Okay.

17:12.332 --> 17:13.564
- Good night.
- Good night.

17:13.566 --> 17:16.334
I love you.

17:16.336 --> 17:17.802
- I love you too.

17:20.406 --> 17:21.539
Thanks for helping, ray.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.674
- Uhh. Mm-hmm-hmm-hmm.

17:30.449 --> 17:35.720
[knock on door]

17:35.722 --> 17:40.158
- Ray, I think
that's for you.

17:40.160 --> 17:42.093
- Huh?

17:42.095 --> 17:43.661
[knocking]

17:47.299 --> 17:49.233
- Ray, ally's
at the door.

17:49.235 --> 17:53.204
- Well, of course
it's ally.

17:53.206 --> 17:55.640
Go to sleep, ally.

17:55.642 --> 17:58.843
Huh? Remember what
we talked about?

17:58.845 --> 18:02.080
I'll see you
in the morning!

18:02.082 --> 18:03.347
- Where's marie?

18:03.349 --> 18:06.451
- Frank!

18:06.453 --> 18:10.188
- I just got back
from the lodge.

18:10.190 --> 18:12.356
I can't find marie
anywhere.

18:12.358 --> 18:14.158
- Well, she's not here.

18:14.160 --> 18:15.726
- That's right, debra.
You're right.

18:15.728 --> 18:17.795
- Mommy!

18:17.797 --> 18:19.564
- Ally?
Are you okay?

18:19.566 --> 18:22.300
- Mommy, grandma
turned into a monster!

18:22.302 --> 18:23.768
- Grandma?

18:23.770 --> 18:27.338
- Oh, no, ally, honey,
sweetie.

18:27.340 --> 18:31.476
It's just me
with some cold cream.

18:31.478 --> 18:33.444
- Marie, what are
you doing here?

18:33.446 --> 18:35.413
- Yeah, I looked
all over for you.

18:35.415 --> 18:36.681
- I left a note on my pillow

18:36.683 --> 18:38.716
Saying I was sleeping
over here tonight.

18:38.718 --> 18:41.252
- Why are you sleeping
over here tonight?

18:46.525 --> 18:48.860
- We're waiting, ma.

18:58.337 --> 19:01.272
- You snuck your mother in
to sleep with ally?

19:01.274 --> 19:03.407
- No, no, no.

19:03.409 --> 19:07.378
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

19:07.380 --> 19:09.547
Just for tonight,
that's all.

19:09.549 --> 19:12.817
All I wanted was one night's
sleep for us, that's all.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.852
- Well, this is <i>restful.</i>

19:14.854 --> 19:16.687
- Nobody checked this
with me.

19:16.689 --> 19:18.356
- Why should anyone check it
with you?

19:18.358 --> 19:19.423
It's none
of your business.

19:19.425 --> 19:20.825
- Where you sleep
is my business!

19:20.827 --> 19:21.859
- Oh, yeah?

19:21.861 --> 19:22.927
- Yeah, that's right.

19:22.929 --> 19:24.462
You're my wife.
You sleep with me.

19:24.464 --> 19:26.564
- You care where I sleep
all of a sudden?

19:26.566 --> 19:29.200
- I don't care! I just
can't sleep without you!

19:32.371 --> 19:34.405
- Oh, frank,

19:34.407 --> 19:37.675
That's the sweetest thing
you've ever said to me.

19:37.677 --> 19:39.810
- Don't kiss me
with that stuff!

19:41.880 --> 19:44.615
- Ray, can we
go home now?

19:44.617 --> 19:45.683
- Yes.

19:45.685 --> 19:48.619
Once again,
thanks for everything.

19:58.297 --> 20:01.732
That was kind of sweet,
wasn't it?

20:01.734 --> 20:04.602
- Ally, can you go to
your room, please?

20:04.604 --> 20:06.470
I need to speak
to daddy.

20:06.472 --> 20:08.973
- Well, no, she doesn't
have to go. She--

20:10.809 --> 20:12.843
I mean, she's scared.

20:12.845 --> 20:17.648
Ally, you can stay here
as long as you want.

20:17.650 --> 20:19.250
Ah, the twins!

20:19.252 --> 20:20.818
They can't sleep!
Yeah, come on, guys.

20:20.820 --> 20:23.888
The bed's--
the bed's open!

20:23.890 --> 20:28.359
Yeah! Plenty of good seats
still available.

20:28.361 --> 20:31.696
Hey, hey! Ha-ha.
