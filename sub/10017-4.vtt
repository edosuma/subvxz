00:14.008 --> 00:15.168
Carter?

00:17.578 --> 00:19.375
Man, somebody get a drool bucket.

00:19.580 --> 00:21.207
Carter, get up!

00:21.416 --> 00:24.408
Where's your pager?
l've been beeping you for five minutes.

00:25.420 --> 00:26.944
lt's right here.

00:27.889 --> 00:30.791
Keep it on your pillow so you
don't sleep through a page.

00:30.993 --> 00:33.427
Come on, let's go.
You've got patients to see.

00:34.296 --> 00:36.628
Carter, let's go! Come on!

00:38.400 --> 00:42.268
We've got an undomiciled male with
a laceration to the forehead in 2.

00:42.471 --> 00:43.802
Clean and stitch the wound.

00:44.006 --> 00:48.340
Please don't take off his shoes or
socks. God knows what you'll find.

00:48.844 --> 00:50.573
This way. This way. Come on.

00:50.779 --> 00:53.771
When you're done, see an old lady
with leg pain in 6.

00:53.983 --> 00:56.417
-You ever get used to this?
-Used to what?

00:56.619 --> 00:57.677
Three hours of sleep.

00:57.887 --> 01:01.084
Anything more and l'm sluggish
all day. The chart's there.

01:01.291 --> 01:02.986
Mark, how was the big day off?

01:03.193 --> 01:06.651
First two hours was great.
Then Rachel and Jen left for Detroit.

01:06.863 --> 01:09.195
-What's that all about?
-Job interview.

01:09.399 --> 01:10.661
Oh, really?

01:10.867 --> 01:12.334
Don't even start.

01:12.535 --> 01:15.595
-Morning, guys.
-Susan, can you work Thursday night?

01:15.805 --> 01:17.602
l am on Thursday night.

01:18.508 --> 01:20.976
Tough. Wife's so far away...

01:21.177 --> 01:23.441
...other immediate temptations
so close.

01:23.646 --> 01:28.209
-You haven't the faintest idea--
-l know exactly what l'm talking about.

01:28.619 --> 01:30.484
Doug, l need you in 3.

01:30.688 --> 01:32.519
And good morning to you,
Nurse Hathaway.

01:32.690 --> 01:33.987
Good morning.

01:35.393 --> 01:39.261
The price breaks on the photocopiers
start with five unit orders.

01:39.630 --> 01:41.029
Be off in a jiff.

01:41.732 --> 01:44.963
Sam, if you're free this afternoon,
say around 3...

01:45.169 --> 01:48.627
...l'd like to offer a package for
your phone, fax, e-mail needs.

01:51.108 --> 01:55.102
Tomorrow then. Have l told you about
our five-year service plan?

01:55.847 --> 02:00.614
We guarantee every pinion, spindle,
sprocket for the life of the machine.

02:00.819 --> 02:03.344
With unlimited service
for the first five years.

02:04.289 --> 02:08.726
lt started last week. People would
speak to Ozzie, but he wouldn't respond.

02:08.926 --> 02:11.395
l thought something was wrong
with his hearing.

02:11.596 --> 02:12.995
Ozzie, can you hear me?

02:14.499 --> 02:17.434
You wouldn't stick things
in your ears, would you?

02:18.003 --> 02:22.100
My mom told me never to put anything
in your ear smaller than your elbow.

02:23.876 --> 02:25.537
Can you hear me whispering?

02:25.711 --> 02:27.269
-Yes.
-Okay.

02:28.781 --> 02:32.774
l'll tell you, Mrs. Chap, there's
no sign of infection, no injury.

02:32.985 --> 02:35.146
His hearing seems to be fine.

02:35.321 --> 02:39.417
That's what's so frustrating.
He hears some things, but not others.

02:40.226 --> 02:42.319
What are the things he doesn't hear?

02:42.662 --> 02:44.630
Like my mother's voice, for one.

02:44.831 --> 02:48.927
She says really terrible,
terrible things.

02:49.135 --> 02:51.331
She thinks that l'm a bad mother.

02:51.538 --> 02:53.836
And your mother lives with you?

02:55.109 --> 02:56.508
No, she's dead.

03:00.047 --> 03:02.174
But you still hear her?

03:05.752 --> 03:08.949
What are some of the other voices
that Ozzie can't hear?

03:09.790 --> 03:10.984
My ex-husband's.

03:12.392 --> 03:14.155
The ice cream man's.

03:14.361 --> 03:15.453
Diana.

03:16.063 --> 03:17.496
Diana?

03:17.664 --> 03:20.793
The Princess of Wales!
Does that ring a bell?

03:21.669 --> 03:23.261
Can you excuse us a second?

03:27.509 --> 03:30.569
Call Psych Services.
Tell them we need a consult.

03:30.778 --> 03:32.575
Get Social Services for the boy.

03:32.780 --> 03:35.681
Leave the door open until he gets here.

03:36.885 --> 03:38.375
What's up, kiddo?

03:39.988 --> 03:41.478
Me and my mom...

03:42.290 --> 03:45.225
-...we can stay together, right?
-You bet you can.

03:47.796 --> 03:49.320
Did you leave the money there?

03:56.338 --> 03:58.465
That's what you sound like!

04:46.224 --> 04:49.216
''Patient is experiencing pain
in the right lower extremity.

04:49.427 --> 04:52.658
Recent history shows colon cancer
and a 4-hour plane flight.

04:52.863 --> 04:55.263
Patient's calf was found to be tender...

04:55.466 --> 04:58.230
...and 4 centimeters larger
than the unaffected side.

04:58.436 --> 05:01.166
Differential diagnosis includes
cellulitis, hematoma...

05:01.372 --> 05:03.101
...and deep vein thrombosis.''

05:03.307 --> 05:05.275
Okay. So, what would you do?

05:05.476 --> 05:09.606
l suggest a CBC, Chem-7, coag
study and a duplex scan of the leg.

05:09.814 --> 05:11.749
All right. Bye now.

05:11.984 --> 05:15.647
Given that two elements of
Virchow's Triad are present...

05:15.854 --> 05:19.449
...l feel a venogram is indicated
if the scan is inconclusive.

05:19.658 --> 05:22.252
-Proceed.
-You concur with my advice?

05:22.461 --> 05:23.928
l said proceed.

05:24.129 --> 05:27.587
Mr. Madsen gets a Gl cocktail,
and check with urology.

05:27.799 --> 05:29.027
Can l get some help?

05:29.234 --> 05:30.997
-We need a doctor!
-Get a wheelchair.

05:31.203 --> 05:32.295
She has chest pains.

05:32.504 --> 05:34.870
l'm Dr. Greene.
Show me where it hurts.

05:35.073 --> 05:37.473
-My heart.
-Have you had heart problems?

05:37.676 --> 05:40.475
Two heart attacks till they
put the machine in her chest.

05:40.680 --> 05:43.444
-A pacemaker?
-No, a defibrillator.

05:43.650 --> 05:46.175
Just relax. Take deep breaths.

05:46.386 --> 05:51.016
l want a 1 2-lead, CBC, Chem-7,
cardiac enzymes and a coag profile.

05:51.224 --> 05:52.748
-What's your name?
-Vilma.

05:52.959 --> 05:56.451
Vilma, you just relax and
we're gonna take care of you.

05:56.663 --> 05:59.928
Sir, l need you to go with
the nurse to the waiting room.

06:00.133 --> 06:02.727
l'll come talk to you
as soon as l can.

06:02.935 --> 06:04.766
What is ''Virchow's Triad'' anyway?

06:04.971 --> 06:09.341
That sounds like a board exam question.
One that l'd skip.

06:09.910 --> 06:13.175
Jerry, do me a favor.
Bring the fan. l'm burning up.

06:13.380 --> 06:15.678
Word on the vine is,
you and Langworthy...

06:15.883 --> 06:18.010
...both put in
for the Starzl Fellowship.

06:18.218 --> 06:19.378
That's no big surprise.

06:19.586 --> 06:21.417
No? She's a year ahead of you.

06:21.622 --> 06:25.251
-So what?
-So heads up. Here comes the competition.

06:27.227 --> 06:30.424
-You get the results on bed 4?
-Not yet.

06:31.332 --> 06:34.028
Sarah, what's Virchow's Triad?

06:34.234 --> 06:37.500
Stasis, trauma and hypercoagulability.

06:39.407 --> 06:42.706
Jerry, get this fan out of here.
lt's blowing in my face.

06:42.911 --> 06:44.879
Dr. B. wanted it there.

06:48.316 --> 06:50.876
Code 3, auto versus pedestrian.
Just pulled up.

06:51.086 --> 06:53.520
l'll take it.
Peter, you can assist.

06:54.289 --> 06:56.519
Come on. Step on it. Step on it.

06:57.092 --> 06:59.754
Hit-and-run victim, approximately 1 7.

06:59.961 --> 07:01.588
Found in a crosswalk in
full arrest.

07:01.796 --> 07:03.730
-Vitals?
-Negative. Pupils are blown.

07:03.932 --> 07:06.629
-How long was he there?
-Who knows? No one saw it.

07:06.836 --> 07:09.430
Come on. Get five units
of O-neg to Trauma One.

07:09.638 --> 07:12.038
Tell X-ray we need
a cross-lateral C-spine.

07:12.241 --> 07:15.699
Grab that lV, Peter.
Step on it, folks. Coming through!

07:16.712 --> 07:19.146
We need more blood.
Give it half of epi.

07:19.348 --> 07:20.713
-Heart sounds?
-Negative.

07:20.916 --> 07:23.749
-Time?
-Eighteen minutes.

07:24.120 --> 07:26.179
-X-ray!
-Wait! Aprons.

07:26.622 --> 07:28.749
Move it. Protect your gonads, Peter.

07:28.958 --> 07:31.825
l always do when you're around.
Let's move, people.

07:32.027 --> 07:33.928
Come on. Move it! Move it!

07:34.164 --> 07:37.258
Fire in the hole! Come on!

07:42.539 --> 07:44.006
-What's going on?
-Kid was DO A.

07:44.174 --> 07:46.233
They're trying to bring him back.

07:47.144 --> 07:49.704
His tube is loose.
Carter, hold his ET tube.

07:50.280 --> 07:52.214
His left side is full of blood.

07:52.416 --> 07:54.281
Autotransfuser!
Let me in there.

07:55.585 --> 07:57.052
Give me some help here.

07:57.721 --> 07:59.882
Come on, kid. Give me some help.

08:00.323 --> 08:01.951
Come on! You can do it.

08:05.797 --> 08:07.094
Come on.

08:12.103 --> 08:14.128
-BP?
-1 50 over 1 05.

08:14.338 --> 08:16.033
-How you feeling?
-l can't breathe!

08:16.240 --> 08:18.731
Respiration is 28. Pulse 1 20.

08:19.010 --> 08:21.638
Let's give her .4 nitro sublingually.

08:23.481 --> 08:25.244
Please, doctor.

08:25.950 --> 08:27.941
-Feel like l'm dying.
-Respiration's 32.

08:28.152 --> 08:31.486
She's hyperventilating.
Try and control your breath, Vilma.

08:31.690 --> 08:32.986
-l can't.
-Slowly.

08:33.558 --> 08:36.289
-lt hurts.
-Let's get her some morphine.

08:47.005 --> 08:48.131
Oh, my God!

08:52.211 --> 08:54.076
Blood pressure's coming down.

08:56.682 --> 08:58.048
Feeling better?

08:59.419 --> 09:01.910
Better. Much better.

09:05.558 --> 09:07.321
You guys can take it from here.

09:20.640 --> 09:23.632
She said she's been taking both
Prolixin and Ativan.

09:23.943 --> 09:26.412
-Schizophrenic?
-Floridly. Yes.

09:26.614 --> 09:29.014
Went off her meds,
now she's delusional.

09:29.383 --> 09:32.181
Hearing voices.
l'm going to have to admit her.

09:32.386 --> 09:33.910
What about the boy?

09:34.355 --> 09:37.722
The social worker's calling
the Presbyterian Home.

09:44.732 --> 09:47.758
Skull fracture, C5 neck fracture...

09:47.968 --> 09:49.993
...hemopneumothorax, ruptured diaphragm.

09:50.204 --> 09:51.193
Any heart activity?

09:54.208 --> 09:55.267
Time?

09:56.278 --> 09:57.905
31 minutes.

10:14.029 --> 10:15.394
Time of death:

10:17.899 --> 10:19.230
1 0:06.

10:33.683 --> 10:35.844
We lose them all the time, Carter.

11:08.352 --> 11:09.717
Does the pain move around?

11:09.920 --> 11:12.980
lt just sits there
like a bayonet to the gut.

11:15.158 --> 11:19.755
-How long have you had this?
-A year, off and on. Never this bad.

11:19.964 --> 11:23.798
Also, l get constipated and
sometimes there's blood in the bowl.

11:24.002 --> 11:25.333
You haven't seen a doctor?

11:25.536 --> 11:29.097
lf he was open nights and Sundays,
but who's got the time?

11:31.442 --> 11:32.568
That's me.

11:33.478 --> 11:34.968
Harry Stopak.

11:35.213 --> 11:37.579
Bob Wellman! How are you?

11:37.782 --> 11:39.841
You got the brochure l sent over?

11:41.252 --> 11:42.844
Sorry, l gotta take this.

11:44.055 --> 11:45.613
So you like the EM-250?

11:46.557 --> 11:48.287
lt's a good copier, Bob.

11:48.494 --> 11:51.019
But frankly, l saw you more
in EM-250 R.

11:55.367 --> 11:57.528
-You get any breakfast yet?
-No.

11:57.703 --> 11:59.102
Get some and be back in 1 5.

11:59.304 --> 12:01.204
Carter, come here a minute.

12:01.407 --> 12:04.843
He was on his way to shoot buckets.
No lD, no name on the ball.

12:05.044 --> 12:07.569
His shorts say ''Von Stuben High.''
Call them.

12:07.780 --> 12:10.180
Maybe someone can come and lD him.

12:10.382 --> 12:13.112
Who said you could
assign duties to my student?

12:13.318 --> 12:17.187
l didn't know you owned him.
l thought he was assigned to surgery.

12:17.390 --> 12:18.584
Well, he isn't.

12:18.792 --> 12:22.956
-Are you saying he's unavailable to me?
-l'm saying next time you ask.

12:23.163 --> 12:27.998
ldentify the dead boy for Dr.
Langworthy, then you report back to me.

12:28.201 --> 12:32.865
Doug Ross. We've got a little girl
here who may have a broken hand--

12:33.540 --> 12:35.667
-You son of a bitch!
-Can you hold on a second?

12:35.842 --> 12:39.243
Get your hands off of me now!
Let go!

12:39.412 --> 12:42.745
You son of a bitch,
get your hands off me now!

12:45.152 --> 12:47.643
You son of a bitch!

12:48.856 --> 12:52.883
Get them off me now!
Get your hands off me now!

12:55.362 --> 12:56.886
Calm down.

12:57.064 --> 12:58.395
Thank you.

13:04.472 --> 13:06.030
Damn it! Damn it!

13:09.910 --> 13:12.401
Give her Haldol l.M.
and get her upstairs!

13:14.616 --> 13:15.708
l'll get you!

13:15.917 --> 13:17.509
Why are you doing this?

13:18.487 --> 13:21.513
-Get her out of here!
-No! Please! Stop this!

13:22.557 --> 13:24.081
The kid's gone.

13:29.431 --> 13:31.490
-Damn it!
-Get someone to look at this.

13:31.700 --> 13:33.224
Thank you, doctor.

13:36.138 --> 13:39.335
Your lab tests look fine, and
your heart rhythm's normal.

13:39.541 --> 13:42.204
l'm gonna give you the name
of an anti-gas tablet.

13:42.411 --> 13:44.777
And l'd lay off the kielbasas
for breakfast.

13:44.981 --> 13:47.472
Thank you, doctor. You saved her.

13:48.985 --> 13:51.749
-lt's another attack!
-ls she seizing?

13:53.456 --> 13:56.687
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
Just relax. Just relax.

13:58.294 --> 14:00.762
Her heart's fine.
Has this happened before?

14:00.963 --> 14:03.124
Never. What was it?

14:06.035 --> 14:07.297
l definitely felt that.

14:07.503 --> 14:09.095
What's happening, doc?

14:09.305 --> 14:11.604
The defibrillator in
her chest is going off.

14:11.775 --> 14:12.764
Why is it shocking me?

14:12.976 --> 14:16.912
lt's supposed to, but only when you're
having arrhythmia, which you are not.

14:17.114 --> 14:18.308
Must be malfunctioning.

14:18.849 --> 14:21.716
-Can't you shut it off?
-We're going to try.

14:22.085 --> 14:23.950
Call Cardiology.

14:26.156 --> 14:28.454
She really sank her teeth into you.

14:28.659 --> 14:32.322
Any patient who's
even potentially psychotic...

14:32.529 --> 14:35.464
...should be placed in
four-point restraints and muzzled.

14:35.666 --> 14:37.258
Spoken like a true healer.

14:37.467 --> 14:39.299
After 1 5 years...

14:39.938 --> 14:41.599
...not one week has gone by...

14:41.806 --> 14:44.434
...without being bitten, spat,
puked or peed on.

14:44.642 --> 14:47.167
You're a misanthropic old fart.

14:48.179 --> 14:49.373
l'm not old.

14:51.816 --> 14:53.511
ls this necessary?

14:54.485 --> 14:57.249
Human mouth literally
swims with bacteria.

14:57.455 --> 14:59.548
Staph aureus, Eikenella.

15:00.391 --> 15:05.055
The woman deserves a lobotomy
or a hammer to the head.

15:06.866 --> 15:08.026
Sorry. Did that hurt?

15:17.409 --> 15:19.377
-Dr. Langworthy?
-Yes?

15:20.179 --> 15:23.979
The janitor at the high school
left a message for the principal.

15:24.183 --> 15:28.017
He's giving me a copy of the yearbook
to try to find the boy's picture.

15:29.188 --> 15:32.589
-l wish l could do something more.
-Such as?

15:33.859 --> 15:36.795
l don't know. Should l go
back to Dr. Benton, or--?

15:36.997 --> 15:38.157
-Go.
-Okay.

15:57.083 --> 16:01.019
lf Billy Fleishell hadn't piled on,
it never would've happened.

16:01.221 --> 16:03.656
He left some cleat marks
on your knuckles.

16:03.858 --> 16:06.759
From his teeth. He speared me,
so l popped him one.

16:06.961 --> 16:09.623
The game's gotten rougher
than when l used to play.

16:09.830 --> 16:10.990
Nothing is broken.

16:11.198 --> 16:14.565
Carol will take Blair to X-ray
and give her something for the pain.

16:14.869 --> 16:16.496
l don't need anything.

16:16.771 --> 16:18.102
Right this way.

16:18.306 --> 16:19.864
John, thanks for coming down.

16:20.074 --> 16:21.507
No problem.

16:22.043 --> 16:23.101
Hey, listen.

16:23.311 --> 16:26.712
l hear you've been quite attentive
to Carol since she got back.

16:27.782 --> 16:29.044
l didn't mean to be.

16:29.250 --> 16:30.615
No, it's okay.

16:30.818 --> 16:33.151
l'm glad you guys are still friends.
Really.

16:37.659 --> 16:39.092
Call me anytime, okay?

16:47.536 --> 16:51.063
Mr. Stopak, you need to see
a specialist for further tests...

16:51.273 --> 16:54.140
...to rule out ulcerative colitis.
Which is serious.

16:54.343 --> 16:56.072
You think that's what l've got?

17:01.184 --> 17:03.584
Based on your history
and what l've seen, no.

17:03.786 --> 17:08.086
l think you have irritable bowel
syndrome, which can become serious.

17:08.290 --> 17:10.521
lf that's what l have,
how do l get rid of it?

17:10.727 --> 17:13.252
lncrease the bran in your diet,
and more important...

17:13.463 --> 17:15.124
...decrease the stress in your life.

17:15.330 --> 17:18.060
l don't exactly control
the stress in my life.

17:18.267 --> 17:20.166
Cut back your work hours.

17:20.435 --> 17:21.630
Cut back?

17:22.405 --> 17:24.498
ln my office there are
two kinds of guys.

17:24.707 --> 17:28.735
Those who sell 1 0 million and win a trip
to Palm Springs and those who don't.

17:28.946 --> 17:31.244
Know how long it's been
since l missed the trip?

17:31.548 --> 17:34.108
l have never missed the trip.

17:35.119 --> 17:37.485
-l'm back.
-Good.

17:37.688 --> 17:41.146
Fill out these slips and take those
urine samples to the lab.

17:42.026 --> 17:43.493
lt's good to be back.

17:48.132 --> 17:49.258
Walt! What's up?

17:49.466 --> 17:51.957
l parked in the first row
near the dumpsters.

17:52.169 --> 17:56.163
-So it was the transmission?
-That sucker was shot.

17:56.508 --> 17:58.066
How you getting back?

17:58.343 --> 18:01.870
-Peanut followed me in the truck.
-ls Jackie excited about tonight?

18:02.147 --> 18:05.844
l'm taking her to this real
fancy place she's been dying to try...

18:06.051 --> 18:08.485
...ever since she heard that
Oprah owned it.

18:08.686 --> 18:11.553
lt's steep, but it's our
1 0th anniversary.

18:11.756 --> 18:13.656
What the hell?
Your sister's worth it.

18:13.858 --> 18:16.725
And l appreciate you coming
to sit with your mom.

18:21.966 --> 18:24.059
How's she doing, man?

18:24.270 --> 18:26.397
Well, no incidents this week.

18:27.206 --> 18:29.401
But you can't leave her alone
for five minutes.

18:29.608 --> 18:32.168
She'll be in the back yard
yelling at the neighbors.

18:33.712 --> 18:36.374
But she had Jackie
take her to the beauty parlor...

18:36.582 --> 18:38.573
...so she can look pretty for you.

18:39.085 --> 18:42.145
Look, man, l gotta split.
8:30, right?

18:42.354 --> 18:43.878
l'll be there.

19:17.190 --> 19:18.987
My name's Carol.

19:21.596 --> 19:23.325
l like your sneakers.

19:23.531 --> 19:27.900
They're not the good kind.
My mom got them from the cheapo store.

19:29.637 --> 19:31.298
Where is she?

19:32.507 --> 19:35.374
The doctors took her upstairs.
She's very sick.

19:35.576 --> 19:38.044
They're gonna try
and make her better.

19:41.883 --> 19:44.579
But that doctor said
we can stay together.

19:45.887 --> 19:49.415
lt looks like your mom may have
to stay here for a while.

19:50.325 --> 19:52.088
Can l see her?

19:53.428 --> 19:56.090
l don't know if she
can have visitors, but l'll check.

19:56.999 --> 19:58.830
You wanna hang out with me?

20:04.940 --> 20:08.034
l'll take you to Cardiology.
They're familiar with this.

20:08.243 --> 20:10.609
You don't have to worry.
You'll be okay.

20:10.812 --> 20:13.337
-Let me grab your records.
-Dr. Lewis.

20:13.549 --> 20:17.280
l appreciate your advice. My wife's
been saying that for 1 8 years.

20:17.487 --> 20:19.819
You have the number for the
gastroenterologist?

20:20.089 --> 20:23.786
Do you know who's in charge of
business machine procurement here?

20:27.497 --> 20:28.691
Hello?

20:29.199 --> 20:31.360
l can't hear you.
Who? Louise!

20:31.568 --> 20:33.297
Did you get the rate card l faxed?

20:34.070 --> 20:36.732
l can't hear you.
lt's kind of noisy here.

20:37.874 --> 20:39.034
Hang up that phone.

20:40.043 --> 20:41.510
Hang up that phone, now!

20:44.914 --> 20:46.815
-You okay?
-What kind of phone is that?

20:47.751 --> 20:51.517
The most powerful hand-held around.
Turbo dial, alphanumeric memory.

20:51.722 --> 20:53.622
-Get you half price.
-l don't want one.

20:53.824 --> 20:57.851
l want you to take that phone
out of this hospital, now! Now!

20:58.862 --> 21:01.524
You're supposed to screw the caps on.

21:01.732 --> 21:04.599
Von Stuben High yearbook.
A guy dropped it off for you.

21:04.802 --> 21:06.702
Yeah, sure.
l'll take care of it.

23:07.696 --> 23:09.186
Find him?

23:10.566 --> 23:13.899
Yeah. Steven Tierny. A junior.

23:15.070 --> 23:18.836
A member of the marching band
and on the debate club.

23:19.842 --> 23:21.332
He was kind of a nerd.

23:23.379 --> 23:24.812
Kind of like me.

23:27.349 --> 23:31.945
l gotta get up to the O.R. and
do a hernia. You call his folks?

23:32.154 --> 23:33.348
Should l?

23:35.157 --> 23:38.025
Get them down here.
Let Langworthy break the news.

23:38.828 --> 23:40.352
Change your clothes.

23:48.304 --> 23:51.432
You're telling me you haven't even
thought about it, with Susan?

23:51.674 --> 23:53.403
So what? l'm a married man.

23:53.610 --> 23:56.170
Doesn't mean l'm not allowed
to even speculate.

23:56.379 --> 23:59.075
You're saying that you would
never act on it? Ever?

23:59.816 --> 24:04.481
You're asking if there are circumstances
where l might possibly, conceivably--

24:04.688 --> 24:08.590
Commit adultery? Yes.
Let's say Jen takes a job out of town...

24:08.793 --> 24:12.160
...in, l don't know, Detroit,
and she leaves you here.

24:12.363 --> 24:14.593
No. There would have to be more.

24:14.799 --> 24:16.357
An affair, perhaps?

24:16.567 --> 24:20.162
She goes out on you and then
you could justifiably....

24:20.805 --> 24:23.968
-Even the score?
-So to speak, yes.

24:26.410 --> 24:28.878
-That's not gonna happen.
-You just never know.

24:31.015 --> 24:33.041
Maybe l could be of service.

24:38.924 --> 24:42.360
Mark, that chest pain rule-out
Ml just got here.

24:48.800 --> 24:52.327
-55-year-old with substernal chest pains.
-Thank you.

24:52.504 --> 24:54.972
-What about her?
-They lost the key.

24:55.173 --> 24:59.439
We'll need bolt cutters for
these cuffs. And cut off these chaps.

24:59.911 --> 25:02.039
This is so embarrassing.

25:02.281 --> 25:05.842
-Exam Room 2, Jer?
-Curtain 3. What's the patient's name?

25:06.486 --> 25:08.147
Neil Shearer.

25:08.888 --> 25:09.946
Thank you.

25:21.167 --> 25:24.000
We're gonna hang out with
all the big people. Hey, Jerry.

25:24.270 --> 25:25.828
This is Ozzie.

25:28.207 --> 25:29.835
How you doing?

25:30.010 --> 25:33.639
He's gonna be with us for a while.
His mom's on the 5th floor.

25:34.081 --> 25:35.571
Okay. Okay.

25:36.016 --> 25:39.179
-Can you watch him for a while?
-Sure, no problem.

25:39.386 --> 25:40.876
l'll be right back.

25:42.456 --> 25:46.586
So. You ever seen a picture
of a diseased gall bladder?

25:55.969 --> 25:57.301
Check it out.

26:03.611 --> 26:04.771
Excuse me.

26:04.979 --> 26:07.277
My husband was brought here
in an ambulance.

26:07.482 --> 26:09.746
-What's his name?
-Neil Shearer.

26:12.487 --> 26:14.148
Wait here one second.

26:21.896 --> 26:24.228
His rhythm's off.
He has multipulpal PVCs.

26:24.432 --> 26:28.130
Give him 1 00 of lidocaine
lV push and start a drip.

26:30.105 --> 26:31.868
Here you go.
Sit down right here.

26:32.074 --> 26:33.336
Thank you. Thank you.

26:33.542 --> 26:35.169
-Excuse me.
-What is it?

26:35.377 --> 26:37.038
Mr. Shearer's wife is at the desk.

26:37.246 --> 26:40.613
-Oh, God!
-Are you and Mrs. Shearer acquainted?

26:41.183 --> 26:42.741
l'm her secretary.

26:42.952 --> 26:45.250
Jerry, show Mrs. Shearer
to the waiting room.

26:45.454 --> 26:46.887
Behind you. Look out.

26:47.089 --> 26:49.455
Malik, you look like a surgeon.

26:49.959 --> 26:52.655
-Excuse me.
-Oh, here.

26:53.362 --> 26:54.352
Come on.

26:54.631 --> 26:56.792
Does it hurt anywhere in here?

26:57.000 --> 26:58.024
Not really.

26:58.234 --> 27:00.202
Just tell me when it does, okay?

27:00.403 --> 27:03.429
-You did an abdominal series?
-lt was negative.

27:03.640 --> 27:05.665
CBC, UA, Chem-7, amylase?

27:05.875 --> 27:08.173
All negative, but her sed rate's 50.

27:08.378 --> 27:11.245
-Right there.
-Okay, just sit tight.

27:14.017 --> 27:17.418
You pulled me off my first
hernia for a lady with arthritis?

27:17.621 --> 27:20.419
-But her sed rate--
-ls high due to inflammation.

27:20.624 --> 27:23.492
She's got no Gl symptoms
and guaiac negative stool.

27:23.694 --> 27:25.628
What surgical problem does she have?

27:25.830 --> 27:28.390
-Gall bladder, appendix--
-Based on what?

27:28.599 --> 27:31.363
Based on what the patient's telling me.

27:31.669 --> 27:33.261
l'll leave you two to chat.

27:33.471 --> 27:37.168
l'll be in the O.R. if you get
a real surgical candidate.

27:41.779 --> 27:43.337
Mrs. Shearer?

27:44.882 --> 27:46.315
Mrs. Shearer?

27:48.386 --> 27:49.683
Ozzie.

27:49.854 --> 27:51.152
Ozzie?

27:52.858 --> 27:54.257
l'll find him.

27:56.995 --> 28:00.692
Hello, Mr. Tierny? This is....

28:01.066 --> 28:05.230
l'm John Carter at the Emergency Room
at Cook County General Hospital.

28:07.005 --> 28:11.567
Your son, Steven, has been
involved in an accident.

28:12.778 --> 28:15.246
His condition is serious.

28:15.447 --> 28:17.972
l think you should
come down here right away.

28:20.286 --> 28:21.753
lt's serious.

28:23.056 --> 28:25.616
Very, very serious. Thank you.

28:35.902 --> 28:39.463
Carol, does the name Joey Skarneckia
ring a bell? lt's a Pedes case.

28:39.672 --> 28:41.765
A car accident about three months ago.

28:41.974 --> 28:43.566
Not a clue.

28:44.043 --> 28:48.606
His insurance company wants information.
Will you call Medical Records for me?

28:48.816 --> 28:50.716
Are your hands painted on?

28:51.819 --> 28:53.116
What?

28:53.287 --> 28:55.653
Pick up the phone and dial.

28:59.593 --> 29:02.653
Out of curiosity, is this
free-flowing hostility...

29:02.863 --> 29:05.593
...aimed at the world in general,
or just me?

29:05.799 --> 29:08.165
-You don't wanna know.
-What?

29:09.470 --> 29:10.562
What?

29:11.305 --> 29:13.068
You told Ozzie he'd be
with his mom...

29:13.273 --> 29:15.970
...when you knew she'd be put away,
probably for a long time.

29:16.144 --> 29:17.634
Just who did you help by lying?

29:18.379 --> 29:19.903
l didn't lie.

29:20.181 --> 29:24.481
Sure you did. You didn't want a
big emotional scene...

29:24.686 --> 29:27.917
...which is something you can't handle
and avoid at all costs.

29:34.629 --> 29:36.392
Oh, boy.
White count's 20,000!

29:36.598 --> 29:40.261
Oh, God! Call the O.R.
Get Morgenstern down here now.

29:41.236 --> 29:42.669
Hang in there.

29:44.340 --> 29:46.433
-Come on, come on!
-l'm trying. Okay--

29:46.809 --> 29:49.642
-Faster! You gotta-- Please!
-Relax.

29:49.845 --> 29:53.042
Go to the left. Go a little bit
to the left, please!

29:53.249 --> 29:55.274
There's a Mrs. Shearer outside.

29:55.484 --> 29:56.542
Hurry, l gotta go!

29:56.752 --> 29:58.617
Patient's conscious.

30:01.991 --> 30:03.959
God! Neil, what happened?

30:04.860 --> 30:06.384
Patient's unconscious.

30:06.595 --> 30:10.929
He had a small heart attack. We gave
him medication and he's stabilized.

30:11.133 --> 30:13.659
l'm gonna have to ask you
to wait outside.

30:13.870 --> 30:16.896
Why do l have to wait outside
if he's stabilized?

30:17.107 --> 30:19.200
lt's hospital policy. l'm sorry.

30:19.843 --> 30:23.904
l'm sorry. This is my husband
and l want to be wherever he is.

30:29.219 --> 30:30.618
What's this?

30:31.121 --> 30:32.383
Do you have a pen?

30:35.325 --> 30:36.587
Where are his clothes?

30:37.561 --> 30:38.550
Excuse me?

30:38.762 --> 30:42.722
The clothes he was wearing when he was
brought in here. Where are they?

30:43.134 --> 30:44.897
l'm not sure.

30:48.406 --> 30:51.000
They have to be here somewhere,
don't they?

31:09.928 --> 31:11.088
Priscilla?

31:27.045 --> 31:30.572
l suppose you all think
this is very, very funny.

31:32.251 --> 31:33.445
Don't you?

31:39.559 --> 31:41.254
Excuse me.

31:48.401 --> 31:51.165
Call the O.R.! We got
a retrocecal appendix. We need a room.

31:51.704 --> 31:55.663
-She perfed?
-Yes, she did. Thanks to Dr. Lewis.

31:55.875 --> 32:00.608
A patient has stabbing lower back pain
and you don't get surgical consult?

32:00.813 --> 32:03.145
A medical student would know better.

32:03.349 --> 32:04.976
She consulted me.

32:05.686 --> 32:08.621
l assessed the patient
wasn't a surgical candidate.

32:09.123 --> 32:10.522
Do you need an assist?

32:10.724 --> 32:12.316
Yes, l do.

32:12.927 --> 32:14.292
Come on, Sarah.

32:25.472 --> 32:26.632
Watch it!

32:27.508 --> 32:29.635
-You seen Dr. Lang--
-Why do you want her?

32:30.010 --> 32:32.103
The parents of the
high-school kid are here.

32:33.949 --> 32:35.712
-What's his name?
-Steven Tierny.

32:35.917 --> 32:39.148
All right, come on.
You gotta learn this anyway.

32:45.460 --> 32:47.018
Mr. and Mrs. Tierny?

32:47.262 --> 32:49.355
Hi. l'm Dr. Benton.

32:50.098 --> 32:52.464
At 9:30 this morning,
your son was brought in...

32:52.667 --> 32:55.636
...in full cardiac
and respiratory arrest.

32:55.904 --> 32:59.032
We tried to revive him,
but with no success.

32:59.674 --> 33:01.767
l'm sorry, your son died.

33:04.847 --> 33:06.109
No!

33:06.716 --> 33:08.115
No.

33:16.258 --> 33:17.748
Can we see him?

33:20.930 --> 33:22.420
Sure.

33:28.104 --> 33:29.503
Oh, no!

33:40.417 --> 33:41.941
Dear God!

33:51.028 --> 33:52.222
Doctor...

33:53.363 --> 33:54.728
...this isn't our son.

33:58.936 --> 34:00.699
Oh, God!

34:31.136 --> 34:32.534
Dr. Greene!

34:33.938 --> 34:35.429
Dr. Greene!

34:36.041 --> 34:37.940
Damn! lt's good to see you, man.

34:38.143 --> 34:42.011
Bob Brickley. One year ago today,
you saved my life.

34:42.246 --> 34:45.580
-Of course.
-A small token of my gratitude.

34:45.784 --> 34:49.117
Frozen T-bone steaks. The real deal.
All the way from Texas.

34:49.321 --> 34:53.155
From now on, August 25th is gonna be
Dr. Greene Day in my book.

34:53.826 --> 34:56.523
l'm gonna honor it every year
for the rest of my life.

34:57.297 --> 34:58.855
Well....

35:00.100 --> 35:01.567
l don't know what to say.

35:02.035 --> 35:03.297
Thank you.

35:04.170 --> 35:06.365
Hey, man, a handshake won't do it!

35:07.540 --> 35:09.405
Happy Dr. Greene Day!

35:15.281 --> 35:18.512
l was embraced by two men today.
l find that highly unusual.

35:18.718 --> 35:21.744
-Some guys have all the luck.
-One gave me a dozen steaks.

35:21.955 --> 35:23.753
How about a cookout on the roof?

35:23.958 --> 35:26.051
That sounds nice, but l've got a date.

35:26.260 --> 35:27.557
Oh, yeah? Anyone l know?

35:27.962 --> 35:29.361
Yeah. Div Cvetic.

35:29.864 --> 35:32.924
We've kind of been together
for a month or so.

35:33.134 --> 35:34.658
Really?

35:36.003 --> 35:38.062
Great. Div's a great guy.

35:43.978 --> 35:46.845
-What's with this patient?
-Addict having withdrawal.

35:47.047 --> 35:50.016
He sounds like a car alarm
that you can't shut off.

36:07.435 --> 36:09.096
Mr. and Mrs. Fisher?

36:10.071 --> 36:11.698
l'm John Carter.

36:13.008 --> 36:16.603
Your son, David, was hit
by a car this morning.

36:18.547 --> 36:22.644
And he was brought here
by ambulance in full arrest.

36:26.088 --> 36:28.716
And we tried to resuscitate him
for 31 minutes.

36:28.925 --> 36:32.452
We used all of our capabilities...

36:32.662 --> 36:36.689
...but his injuries were too severe,
and he died.

36:40.269 --> 36:41.702
And l'm sorry.

37:07.931 --> 37:09.159
How is she?

37:09.700 --> 37:11.600
Fine. ln and out, 20 minutes.

37:11.802 --> 37:13.292
Peter, listen.

37:13.904 --> 37:17.534
That was a difficult diagnosis.
Lots of surgeons would've missed it.

37:17.809 --> 37:21.836
Because a lot of them don't take
the time to listen to their patients.

37:22.747 --> 37:24.237
The good ones do.

37:34.025 --> 37:36.550
l'm doing a Whipple procedure.
Care to assist?

37:37.629 --> 37:39.654
A Whipple? Are you kidding?

37:39.864 --> 37:43.391
Patient's a 62-year-old man with
a history of pancreatic cancer.

37:43.601 --> 37:46.002
Came in four weeks ago
with mid-upper gastric....

37:46.205 --> 37:47.502
ER.

37:50.142 --> 37:55.079
Dr. Taglieri wants to see you outside
supplies, about that missing kid.

37:58.951 --> 38:02.352
And these squiggly tubes here,
these are the intestines, see?

38:02.688 --> 38:05.179
And this blob, that's the heart.

38:05.457 --> 38:06.822
Where's the gall bladder?

38:07.426 --> 38:09.417
What do you know?
Someone took it out.

38:09.695 --> 38:10.992
Must've been diseased.

38:11.797 --> 38:15.199
You still got yours though, don't you?
lt's down there somewhere.

38:17.137 --> 38:19.230
Where are you taking me this time?

38:19.673 --> 38:23.109
A social worker is going to take you
to the Presbyterian Home.

38:25.412 --> 38:27.073
l can't stay with my mom?

38:30.250 --> 38:32.377
The truth is that
your mother's very sick.

38:32.886 --> 38:35.980
lt's not her fault.
She hasn't done anything wrong.

38:36.289 --> 38:40.316
But to help her get better, she's being
sent to the psychiatric hospital.

38:44.265 --> 38:45.596
l hate her.

38:46.133 --> 38:48.328
l don't think that's true.

38:49.470 --> 38:52.337
Listen, your mama loves you very much.

38:52.907 --> 38:54.772
Then why is this happening?

38:56.577 --> 38:58.841
l wish l could tell you. Come here.

39:01.115 --> 39:02.582
l wish l knew.

39:14.863 --> 39:15.852
How was the Whipple?

39:16.064 --> 39:18.726
-No problem. ln and out.
-Who performed it?

39:19.568 --> 39:21.092
l did.

39:28.243 --> 39:30.734
-Walt, l'm sorry--
-Our 1 0th anniversary.

39:30.946 --> 39:32.436
l know, l got held up in O.R.

39:32.647 --> 39:35.980
No, no, no!
Don't hand me that ''O.R.'' crap.

39:36.151 --> 39:40.213
l know how important your work is
compared to the small events of my life.

39:40.690 --> 39:42.157
Walt, l'm sorry.

39:42.358 --> 39:45.327
We don't ask much.
Practically nothing.

39:45.528 --> 39:48.986
Just that once in a while you come
and sit with your mother...

39:49.198 --> 39:51.393
...so your sister and l can be together.

39:51.601 --> 39:53.865
And you act like
you're doing us a favor!

39:54.337 --> 39:56.396
Okay. All right, Walt....

39:56.572 --> 39:59.905
My next three nights off
l'll come and sit with her. l promise.

40:00.109 --> 40:02.634
l forgot, man. l swear l'm sorry.

40:08.285 --> 40:10.344
Funny how that happens...

40:11.555 --> 40:13.785
...when it comes to your family.

40:32.910 --> 40:34.070
You off?

40:34.778 --> 40:37.247
-Yeah.
-Me too.

40:37.882 --> 40:40.146
Twelve whole hours.

40:41.619 --> 40:43.314
When you back on?

40:43.588 --> 40:47.046
Tomorrow. lf l come back.

40:47.792 --> 40:49.054
You serious?

40:51.763 --> 40:54.095
l can't remember even why
l'm doing this.

40:55.033 --> 40:56.898
You wanna be a doctor, right?

40:59.103 --> 41:02.971
Benton told my adviser l was
doing a generally adequate job.

41:03.208 --> 41:05.541
And that was before today.

41:07.012 --> 41:08.809
l don't belong here.

41:16.388 --> 41:18.151
What kind of drugs is that guy on?

41:23.329 --> 41:26.162
Help! Help!
My wife is having a baby!

41:28.100 --> 41:29.965
lt's coming. l can feel it!

41:30.536 --> 41:32.027
-That's the head.
-What do l do?

41:32.239 --> 41:34.104
You take it. l'll get help.

41:34.808 --> 41:37.276
You're gonna be fine.
Your baby's coming.

41:37.511 --> 41:39.843
All you have to do
is lie back and push.

41:41.014 --> 41:43.380
Okay? Whenever you're ready.

41:46.920 --> 41:49.115
That's it, just push. Push!

41:49.289 --> 41:51.689
Push. That's it, push.

41:51.892 --> 41:55.794
Okay. One final push now. Come on.
Come on. That's it.

41:55.962 --> 41:56.986
You're doing great.

41:57.197 --> 41:59.928
Now move the cord back over the head.

42:00.134 --> 42:01.761
You got it. That's it.

42:02.336 --> 42:04.270
You're doing great! You're doing great.

42:04.472 --> 42:07.236
Okay, one final push.
Come on, just push.

42:07.475 --> 42:08.965
That's it, okay. Push!

42:09.176 --> 42:11.576
-Move the cord out of the way.
-That's it.

42:11.746 --> 42:13.907
That's it. That's it.

42:16.551 --> 42:17.779
lt's a girl!

42:34.102 --> 42:35.364
You all right?

42:36.238 --> 42:37.227
You got her?

42:43.979 --> 42:45.810
Over there. Get the lock.

43:21.985 --> 43:23.680
Yes!

43:24.922 --> 43:26.446
Yes!

43:48.712 --> 43:51.738
-Hey, Doug.
-Hey, John.

43:57.822 --> 44:00.382
-This is a bad idea.
-Who is it?

44:02.594 --> 44:03.925
Doug Ross.

44:06.765 --> 44:08.062
What are you doing?

44:08.266 --> 44:11.463
Nothing. My car broke down...

44:12.103 --> 44:14.503
...and the tow truck was
taking so long...

44:14.739 --> 44:17.264
...l thought l would use your phone.

44:20.311 --> 44:22.371
l'm late for my date.

44:23.883 --> 44:26.647
You know, l see the
tow truck right there.

44:30.456 --> 44:31.718
l'm really sorry.

45:04.424 --> 45:05.982
What were you thinking?

45:06.193 --> 45:09.424
What could you possibly have
thought would happen tonight?

45:09.629 --> 45:13.030
That you would come to
my doorstep at midnight, drunk...

45:13.233 --> 45:16.930
...and l would find that as
some sort of grand gesture of love?

45:17.571 --> 45:20.598
ls that what you were thinking?
That you can just show up?

45:20.808 --> 45:23.208
l'll invite you back in my life?
ln my bed?

45:23.411 --> 45:24.844
ls that what you imagined?

45:25.079 --> 45:27.843
-l don't know.
-You have no right to do this!

45:28.049 --> 45:29.414
l'm sorry.

45:30.384 --> 45:32.409
Do you think that you love me?

45:34.589 --> 45:37.422
For how long, Doug? How long...

45:37.625 --> 45:41.857
...till you start wondering if there
isn't someone better in the next room?

45:42.530 --> 45:44.589
How long till you're reminded...

45:44.799 --> 45:49.737
...of all the 22-year-olds you could be
screwing tomorrow or the next day?

45:52.074 --> 45:54.907
l will not let you
do this to me again.

46:00.582 --> 46:01.810
l'm sorry.
