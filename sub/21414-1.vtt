Come meet Meg.

02:54.583 --> 02:56.709
He's a little shy.
He's a great kid.

02:56.709 --> 02:59.041
Active imagination.
Probably could take care
of himself.

02:59.041 --> 03:03.792
So, he could pretty much watch
and eat whatever he wants.

03:03.792 --> 03:05.583
Preferably I have him
in bed around 9:00.

03:05.583 --> 03:08.041
I probably won't be
much later than 10:00.

you're really helping me out.

03:11.041 --> 03:13.417
Wait, did you want
to see my references?

03:13.417 --> 03:15.792
- ( door opens )
- Oh, no, it's okay.
You seem like a nice girl.

03:15.792 --> 03:18.083
Hey, Ralph,
be a good boy tonight.

03:19.750 --> 03:21.750
Just give him
a few minutes.

04:11.375 --> 04:12.875
Ralph?

Hello?

04:40.125 --> 04:44.792
My name is Meg
and I'm really excited

04:46.667 --> 04:48.458
Do you wanna come out?

Hey!

05:06.750 --> 05:08.333
Ralph:
Sorry.

05:10.291 --> 05:12.208
Why did you slam
the door on me?

05:14.250 --> 05:15.875
I had to.

05:17.333 --> 05:18.542
Why?

05:21.250 --> 05:23.542
You wouldn't understand.

05:23.542 --> 05:26.875
Do you wanna try me?
I'm really easy to talk to.

05:29.792 --> 05:32.834
Would you like to come out
so I can introduce myself?

05:34.959 --> 05:37.583
- Okay.
- Okay.

05:37.583 --> 05:39.083
Great.

05:41.333 --> 05:45.083
Could you move away
from the door, please?

05:48.291 --> 05:50.709
Yeah, sure.

06:08.834 --> 06:09.750
( door opens )

06:21.625 --> 06:24.000
Hi, I'm Ralph.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.875
Meg.
Nice to meet you.

06:25.875 --> 06:27.500
Nice to
meet you, too.

06:29.125 --> 06:31.458
I can explain.

06:31.458 --> 06:33.792
Okay.

06:33.792 --> 06:38.583
It's just that Ralphie
has a bit of a temper.

06:38.583 --> 06:41.333
- Ralphie?
- Yes, Ralphie.

06:42.750 --> 06:45.333
Is that one
of your nicknames?

06:45.333 --> 06:48.417
( whispering )
I'm Ralph. I'm not Ralphie.

06:48.417 --> 06:51.291
I'm very different
than Ralphie is.

06:51.291 --> 06:56.125
I see.
So, who's Ralphie?

06:56.125 --> 06:59.792
You-- you don't wanna
know Ralphie.

06:59.792 --> 07:01.166
Why not?

07:01.166 --> 07:05.375
'Cause he's
kind of bad.

07:07.166 --> 07:10.041
But don't worry,
that's why I locked him
in the bathroom.

07:10.041 --> 07:11.834
He won't bother us.

07:11.834 --> 07:13.500
Well, good.

07:13.500 --> 07:16.625
Why don't you and I
just forget about Ralphie
and have some fun?

07:20.041 --> 07:22.834
- You hungry?
- Yes.

07:22.834 --> 07:26.000
Man on TV:
Well, you can't blame Grace.
You know what I mean?

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
( continues indistinctly )

07:29.000 --> 07:30.834
( audience laughing )

07:30.834 --> 07:33.375
I actually kind of
like this show.

07:33.375 --> 07:35.583
I hope there's
another one.

07:35.583 --> 07:38.750
( chuckles )
My dad used to
make me watch it

07:38.750 --> 07:41.583
and I hated it then,
but now I kind of
think it's funny.

07:41.583 --> 07:44.583
- You watched TV
with your dad?
- Sure.

07:44.583 --> 07:45.917
Cool.

07:49.291 --> 07:53.375
- Well, it's almost
9:00 PM, so...
- ( whines )

07:53.375 --> 07:58.250
- ( TV turns off )
- Come on, can we watch
one more, please?

07:58.250 --> 07:59.875
I told your dad
I'd get you to bed
by 9:00 PM

07:59.875 --> 08:01.875
and he's
coming back soon, so...

08:01.875 --> 08:04.208
He won't be back soon.

08:04.208 --> 08:07.208
- Of course he will.
- No, he won't.

08:07.208 --> 08:10.375
He's out on a date.

08:10.375 --> 08:12.542
Okay, so?

08:12.542 --> 08:16.542
So, when he goes out on dates,
he stays out really late.

08:16.542 --> 08:21.000
Well, he told me he was
coming back by 10:00 PM.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.250
He says a lot of things.
Not all of them are true.

08:25.250 --> 08:28.125
Well, either way,
I think that you should
have a bath before bedtime.

08:28.125 --> 08:30.458
I don't wanna
take a bath.

08:30.458 --> 08:31.750
Why not?

08:33.750 --> 08:37.417
Because Ralphie's
in there.

08:37.417 --> 08:39.458
Ah.

08:39.458 --> 08:42.083
Ralphie, right.

08:42.083 --> 08:44.875
You forgot,
didn't you?

08:46.625 --> 08:48.250
I did.

08:48.250 --> 08:50.375
I never forget
about Ralphie.

08:53.166 --> 08:55.792
Would you like me to go
have a talk with Ralphie

08:55.792 --> 08:58.333
and ask him if it's okay
if you could have a bath?

08:58.333 --> 09:01.083
I don't think
that's a good idea.

09:01.083 --> 09:02.709
Why not?

09:02.709 --> 09:07.125
Because he doesn't
like girls.

09:07.125 --> 09:09.834
- He doesn't?
- No.

09:09.834 --> 09:11.750
Hmm.

09:11.750 --> 09:14.667
- How do you know?
- I just know.

09:18.458 --> 09:20.625
- What?
- I have an idea.

09:20.625 --> 09:22.583
Okay.

09:23.834 --> 09:26.500
- Oh, Ralphie!
I know--
- Shh!

09:26.500 --> 09:29.417
Hey!
That's not okay.

09:29.417 --> 09:31.834
- Shh. Quiet.
- What?

09:31.834 --> 09:35.291
- You're gonna wake up Ralphie.
- I was just making a joke.

09:35.291 --> 09:37.125
Well, it's not funny.

09:37.125 --> 09:40.792
Ralph, come on.
We both know that there is
no one in the bathroom.

09:42.333 --> 09:44.792
Damn it.

09:44.792 --> 09:47.000
- What?
- He heard you.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.959
And now he wants
to talk to me.

09:48.959 --> 09:51.709
- Tell him no.
- I can't.

09:51.709 --> 09:53.375
Why not?

09:53.375 --> 09:55.166
You wouldn't
understand.

09:57.750 --> 09:59.458
I'll be back.

10:03.959 --> 10:05.166
( sighs )

10:06.750 --> 10:08.166
( door slams )

10:30.750 --> 10:33.000

10:33.000 --> 10:35.583

10:37.041 --> 10:40.375

10:47.083 --> 10:49.709
Ah! What are you doing?!
No, stop it!

10:49.709 --> 10:52.709
( grunting )
I'm gonna get you!

10:52.709 --> 10:56.542

10:56.542 --> 10:58.208

11:18.208 --> 11:20.417
- Ralph: Hello?
- ( gasps )

11:20.417 --> 11:21.959
Meg?

11:23.792 --> 11:25.709
Are you okay?

11:29.000 --> 11:30.375
Did he come after you?

11:32.250 --> 11:33.917
Did he get you?

11:42.250 --> 11:44.375
Ralph,

11:44.375 --> 11:47.750
I understand
that this might be
a fun game for you,

11:47.750 --> 11:49.917
but this
is not fun for me.

11:49.917 --> 11:53.583
This isn't a game.

11:53.583 --> 11:56.417
Well, whatever it is,
it needs to stop now, okay?

11:56.417 --> 11:57.959
'Cause you're scaring me.

12:00.125 --> 12:02.709
I wish
I could stop it.

12:02.709 --> 12:04.750
( phone chimes )

12:20.083 --> 12:21.625
I'm sorry.

12:50.792 --> 12:51.959
( Ralph exhales )

12:51.959 --> 12:55.667
Do you have
any children, Meg?

12:55.667 --> 12:59.667
Let's just close our eyes
and get back to sleep,
okay, Ralph?

12:59.667 --> 13:02.750
- But I can't sleep.
- Yes, you can.

13:02.750 --> 13:06.041
It's way past your bedtime
and your dad's gonna be
home any minute.

13:06.041 --> 13:07.709
No, he won't.

13:09.333 --> 13:11.959
Why do you
keep saying that?

13:13.834 --> 13:16.125
So, you don't
have kids?

13:16.125 --> 13:18.875
No, I don't.

13:18.875 --> 13:21.917
I think you'd be
a great mom.

13:21.917 --> 13:24.500
Thanks, Ralph.

13:24.500 --> 13:27.542
Now, let's just
get back to bed.

13:27.542 --> 13:30.041
But I wanna talk.

13:30.041 --> 13:31.875
It's just so late.

13:31.875 --> 13:35.959
Please?
I never get to
talk to any girls,

13:35.959 --> 13:38.375
and you're so nice.

13:39.917 --> 13:42.041
Fine.

13:42.041 --> 13:43.583
Five minutes.

13:43.583 --> 13:44.542
Yes!

13:46.917 --> 13:49.542
What do you wanna
talk about?

13:55.583 --> 13:56.750
Sex.

13:57.834 --> 14:00.792
Where did you hear
that word?

14:00.792 --> 14:01.750
My dad.

14:03.500 --> 14:07.417
I think it's something
that you should talk
to your dad about.

14:07.417 --> 14:09.750
I already did.

14:09.750 --> 14:11.625
And what did he say?

14:11.625 --> 14:13.792
That it's
for grown-ups.

14:13.792 --> 14:15.375
That's definitely true.

14:16.834 --> 14:20.250
And that he'll tell me
when I get older.

14:20.250 --> 14:22.125
I think
that sounds right.

14:23.250 --> 14:25.250
Maybe we just
leave it at that.

14:28.750 --> 14:32.917
But I always
hear him talking about it
with his friends,

14:32.917 --> 14:37.291
about how he has
sex with all the girls
he goes on dates with.

14:37.291 --> 14:42.250
And I don't know what it is
and he won't tell me.

14:42.250 --> 14:44.000
Please tell me.

14:45.583 --> 14:47.625
I just don't think
that it's my place

14:47.625 --> 14:50.792
to talk to you about
that sort of thing.

14:50.792 --> 14:55.750
- Why not?
- Well, I'm not your parent.

14:56.792 --> 14:58.500
But my dad
won't tell me

14:58.500 --> 15:02.291
and I don't have
a mom.

15:05.375 --> 15:07.792
What happened
to your mom, sweetie?

15:07.792 --> 15:10.667
She's... gone.

15:14.458 --> 15:16.750
Where did she go?

15:18.542 --> 15:20.875
It's hard to explain.

15:22.709 --> 15:25.583
Well, you don't
have to talk about it
if you don't want to.

15:25.583 --> 15:28.000
No, it's okay.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.041
I wanna talk about it.

15:30.041 --> 15:34.834
It's just, well--
there's the story
me and my dad always tell,

15:34.834 --> 15:38.625
and then there's
what really happened.

15:38.625 --> 15:40.291
What do you mean?

15:40.291 --> 15:41.834
My dad.

15:41.834 --> 15:46.500
He made up a story
and that's the one we tell.

15:46.500 --> 15:49.500
But it's not
the truth.

15:50.792 --> 15:53.041
( inhales, exhales )

15:53.041 --> 15:57.125
You know what,
I think our five minutes
of talking are up,

15:57.125 --> 16:01.583
so maybe you should try
to get back to bed now, okay?

16:01.583 --> 16:06.667
Can I just tell you the story
that my dad made up first?

16:06.667 --> 16:08.458
And then
I'll go to sleep.

16:08.458 --> 16:11.583
- Ralph.
- Please?

16:11.583 --> 16:15.000
And then you promise me
you'll get back to bed?

16:15.000 --> 16:17.375
I promise.

16:19.041 --> 16:21.041
Pinkie swear?

16:23.417 --> 16:25.542
Pinkie swear.

16:26.709 --> 16:28.917
( sighs )
All right.

16:28.917 --> 16:33.875
So, one day,
I was waiting for my mom
to pick me up for school.

16:33.875 --> 16:35.583
And she didn't come.

16:35.583 --> 16:38.041
And when my dad
finally came,

16:38.041 --> 16:40.041
he bought me
a Happy Meal,

16:40.041 --> 16:42.125
which he never does
before.

16:42.125 --> 16:47.583
And he told me that Mom
was going through
a hard time

16:47.583 --> 16:48.709
and that...

16:51.333 --> 16:55.959
she was so sad,
she wanted to escape
everything.

16:55.959 --> 16:58.917
So she put a rope
in her closet

16:58.917 --> 17:02.041
and she put her--
she put her neck in it.

17:02.041 --> 17:05.542
And when she jumped,
she kind of--

17:07.083 --> 17:11.417
she hung there
until she couldn't
breathe anymore.

17:11.417 --> 17:15.875
And she escaped
everything.

17:18.709 --> 17:23.375
Ralph, sweetie,
I'm-- I'm so sorry.

17:23.375 --> 17:25.291
You don't have
to be sorry.

17:25.291 --> 17:26.792
It's just a story.

17:30.458 --> 17:32.542
You mean that
that was...?

17:32.542 --> 17:34.750
It wasn't real.

17:37.583 --> 17:39.750
( sighs )

17:39.750 --> 17:41.417
Okay, then.

17:41.417 --> 17:43.333
Well, thanks
for the story.

17:45.125 --> 17:46.583
Now, let's just
get to bed.

17:46.583 --> 17:48.959
- But--
- No, remember,
you promised.

17:48.959 --> 17:52.500
One story and you were
gonna go to bed.

17:52.500 --> 17:55.458
Okay, fine.

17:58.125 --> 18:00.500
Good night, Ralph.

18:00.500 --> 18:02.000
Sleep well.

18:32.333 --> 18:33.875
( sighs )

18:48.583 --> 18:52.667
The true story is that
Ralphie killed my mom.

18:52.667 --> 18:57.375
Ralph, I told you
that we were not going to
play this game anymore.

18:57.375 --> 19:01.709
Shh! If Ralphie
hears me telling you this,
he's gonna get very angry.

19:01.709 --> 19:04.375
Ralph, I understand
that you're having
a hard time

19:04.375 --> 19:06.208
and that this game
might be whatever for you,

19:06.208 --> 19:07.625
but you're starting
to scare me!

19:07.625 --> 19:09.208
( whispering )
He scares me every day.

19:09.208 --> 19:11.875
He killed my mom
and he says I'm gonna be next.

19:11.875 --> 19:15.375
He chases me around
my room at night saying,
"I'm gonna get you."

19:15.375 --> 19:17.083
- Ralph, stop it!
- Shh!

19:17.083 --> 19:18.959
- ( gasps ) Stop this!
- He'll hear you!

19:18.959 --> 19:21.041
Don't touch me.

19:21.041 --> 19:23.041
Oh, you woke him up!

19:23.041 --> 19:24.542
Why did you do that?!

19:26.709 --> 19:28.625
( door opens, slams )

19:33.041 --> 19:35.875
( thudding,
glass shattering )

19:37.667 --> 19:39.208
Oh, no, no, no.

19:40.667 --> 19:43.083
( thudding continues )

19:45.583 --> 19:48.083
Bradley's voice:
Hi, you've reached Bradley.
Leave a message.

19:48.083 --> 19:49.500
Hey, Brad, this is Meg.

19:49.500 --> 19:51.250
I need you to come here
as soon as you possibly can

19:51.250 --> 19:52.750
or just call me back.

19:52.750 --> 19:55.583
- Please just call me back.
- ( clattering )

19:55.583 --> 19:57.709
Ralph:
No!

19:57.709 --> 19:59.792
Ralphie:
Yes!

19:59.792 --> 20:01.417
Ralph:
Ah, stop it!

20:01.417 --> 20:04.250
Please,
you're hurting me!

20:04.250 --> 20:07.709
- ( line ringing )
- Dispatch: 911, what's
your emergency?

20:07.709 --> 20:11.125
Hi, hi, yes, um, I'm here--
I'm babysitting a little boy

20:11.125 --> 20:15.333
and I think he's crazy
or I'm not sure if he's
a danger to himself.

20:15.333 --> 20:18.625
- His father
is not calling me back.
- Ralphie: Die, die, die!

20:18.625 --> 20:20.792
Yes, I'm at the motel
off the parkway.

20:20.792 --> 20:22.709
- Dispatch: Mm-hmm, okay.
- Yes, room 104.

20:22.709 --> 20:25.125
Please come here as soon
as you possibly can.
Please hurry.

20:25.125 --> 20:27.959
- All right,
we'll send someone.
- Thank you.

20:27.959 --> 20:29.750
( clattering continues )

20:32.250 --> 20:34.083
( banging, clattering )

20:39.834 --> 20:42.959
( Ralph sighs )
I'm so sorry, Meg.

20:42.959 --> 20:46.291
He's just
too strong for me.

20:49.792 --> 20:52.500
( deep voice )
I'm gonna get you.

20:52.500 --> 20:54.542
- ( Ralphie screams )
- ( grunts )

20:56.166 --> 20:58.250
( Ralphie grunting )
Let me go!

20:58.250 --> 21:01.500
- Ralph: No!
- I need to get her!

21:01.500 --> 21:04.333
Ralph:
No, I won't let you!

21:06.000 --> 21:07.125
No!

21:07.125 --> 21:09.208
( muffled screaming )

21:09.208 --> 21:10.625
( screaming continues )

21:12.375 --> 21:15.375
- No, get off of him!
- Stop it!

21:15.375 --> 21:17.208
- Get off!
- ( screaming )

21:18.458 --> 21:20.750
( gasps )

21:20.750 --> 21:23.500
( Ralph choking )

21:23.500 --> 21:25.959
( labored breathing )

21:50.375 --> 21:52.041
( shouts )

21:52.041 --> 21:53.750
( grunts )

22:09.792 --> 22:13.834
( gasps, whimpering )

22:16.709 --> 22:18.417
( Meg coughs )

22:39.625 --> 22:40.959
( door opens )

22:43.417 --> 22:44.625
Ralph?

22:46.250 --> 22:47.917
Ralph?
Oh, my God, Ralph!

22:47.917 --> 22:50.083
Ralph!

22:50.083 --> 22:51.750
What did you do
to him?!

22:51.750 --> 22:54.208
Oh, my God, Ralph.
Ralph? Wake up, Ralph!

22:54.208 --> 22:55.875
Breathe. Breathe!

22:55.875 --> 22:57.500
What did you do?!

22:57.500 --> 22:59.625
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

22:59.625 --> 23:01.458
( sobbing )
Wake up. Come on.

23:01.458 --> 23:03.917
Breathe, please. Breathe.
Breathe, you gotta breathe.

23:03.917 --> 23:05.834
No, it was Ralphie.

23:05.834 --> 23:09.542
Ralphie-- Ralphie tried
to kill me, okay?!

23:09.542 --> 23:12.000
Ralphie was trying
to strangle me!

23:12.000 --> 23:16.625
- No.
- Please. Breathe.
You gotta breathe.

23:16.625 --> 23:19.625
- ( Bradley crying )
- Oh, my God.

23:19.625 --> 23:22.542
Please wake up.
Wake up. Breathe.

23:22.542 --> 23:25.125
Breathe. Please.

23:25.125 --> 23:26.667
Please.

23:26.667 --> 23:29.417
( laughing )

23:30.875 --> 23:32.792
- Sorry.
- ( siren wailing )

23:32.792 --> 23:34.667
I'm sorry.

23:39.041 --> 23:40.333
( door slams )

23:40.333 --> 23:41.959
( laughter echoes )

23:43.709 --> 23:45.625
( music playing )

24:44.375 --> 24:45.083
(CLOCK TICKING)

24:45.458 --> 24:46.875
MAN:
Here lies a door.

24:46.875 --> 24:49.166
Beyond it lies
something wonderful.

24:50.709 --> 24:52.375
♪ (INDUSTRIAL MUSIC PLAYING) ♪

24:56.709 --> 24:57.834
Are you ready?

24:58.458 --> 25:00.542

25:00.542 --> 25:01.417
