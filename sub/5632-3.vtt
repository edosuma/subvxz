WEBVTT

00:06.648 --> 00:08.948
Says "Keep Out."
Don't mind that.

00:08.983 --> 00:11.618
What a cute little pond.

00:11.653 --> 00:13.786
I don't know about this, Brandy.
(scoffs)

00:13.820 --> 00:15.288
Can fish
really give pedicures?

00:15.322 --> 00:16.689
It's not like
they got hands.

00:16.723 --> 00:18.023
They don't need 'em.

00:18.057 --> 00:19.792
Fish just nibble off
the dead skin

00:19.826 --> 00:22.161
like a fat man
at an all-you-can-eat buffet.

00:22.195 --> 00:24.029
It's one of them
Japanese things.

00:24.063 --> 00:25.531
I read about it in a magazine.

00:25.565 --> 00:27.500
But what if it hurts?

00:27.534 --> 00:29.501
Hell, it ain't a beauty
treatment if it don't hurt some.

00:29.535 --> 00:33.004
Come on. Ladies up in New York
pay big bucks for this stuff.

00:33.038 --> 00:37.074
But you and me-- we're gonna
get it for free. Here.

00:37.109 --> 00:38.710
Try some of this.

00:38.744 --> 00:40.512
I swiped it from
Billy Ray's tackle box.

00:40.546 --> 00:42.580
Fish love
this stuff.

00:42.615 --> 00:45.417
Few minutes from now,
these busted ol' feet

00:45.451 --> 00:47.083
are gonna feel
soft as a baby's.

00:47.118 --> 00:49.853
Ooh.

00:49.887 --> 00:51.888
It kind of tickles,
don't it?

00:54.892 --> 00:56.360
"Hurts" is more like it.
Ow!

00:56.394 --> 00:58.529
One of these fish
got my entire foot in its mouth.

00:58.563 --> 01:00.130
Relax, drama queen.

01:00.164 --> 01:02.933
I'm serious, Brandy.
It really hurts.

01:02.967 --> 01:04.766
This is what I get for trying
to do something creative

01:04.802 --> 01:06.602
on ladies night. Next time,
we'll just stay at home...

01:06.637 --> 01:08.638
(both screaming)

01:11.642 --> 01:13.576
Get it off!
Get it off!

01:17.247 --> 01:19.716
BOOTH: <i>Look, I don't care what</i>
<i>your logbook says, okay?</i>

01:19.750 --> 01:24.018
But the package never got here,
delivered to my house.

01:24.053 --> 01:25.687
No, I don't
want to file a complaint.

01:25.722 --> 01:28.690
I just want my brother's ashes.

01:28.725 --> 01:31.360
Is there is a problem
with Jared's remains?

01:31.394 --> 01:32.961
Yeah, they're MIA.
Listen, do you...

01:32.995 --> 01:35.464
you haven't seen a box
around here, about this big?

01:35.498 --> 01:38.466
I-I would have noticed a box
of ashes from a crematorium.

01:38.500 --> 01:41.134
Don't worry, Booth.
We'll track it down.

01:41.169 --> 01:42.970
I couldn't help Jared
when he was alive,

01:43.004 --> 01:44.672
now I can't even find his ashes.

01:44.706 --> 01:48.075
Mommy, Daddy,
Can I wake up Hank now?

01:48.109 --> 01:50.578
Christine, what did we say
about waking a sleeping baby?

01:50.612 --> 01:52.913
But he wants me to get in his
crib and read him a story.

01:52.947 --> 01:54.814
Oh, okay,
I'll tell you what.

01:54.849 --> 01:56.683
Okay, when I'm done here looking
around for what I'm trying

01:56.717 --> 01:58.048
to find, I'll come
read you a book, okay?

01:58.072 --> 01:59.499
What are you
looking for, Daddy?

01:59.500 --> 02:01.121
Oh. Daddy's
looking for Uncle Jared.

02:01.154 --> 02:03.189
No, no.
But Daddy said Uncle Jared

02:03.223 --> 02:05.291
was in Heaven.
No, uh,

02:05.325 --> 02:08.026
Uncle Jared was cremated.
Daddy's looking for his ashes.

02:08.061 --> 02:10.363
Really, do we have to explain
something like that to her?

02:10.398 --> 02:12.364
Do you have to do that?
Death isn't something

02:12.399 --> 02:13.932
to be shied away from, Booth.

02:13.966 --> 02:15.534
From an anthropological
standpoint,

02:15.568 --> 02:17.369
the more openly
a culture

02:17.404 --> 02:20.972
embraces death, the less anxiety
they associate with it.

02:21.007 --> 02:23.108
(phone rings)
A body was found

02:23.142 --> 02:24.943
at a fish farm in West Virginia.
It's being brought

02:24.977 --> 02:26.945
to the Jeffersonian.
Listen, all right,

02:26.979 --> 02:28.323
I'll tell you what-- go-go
get dressed, monkey.

02:28.423 --> 02:30.782
But what about reading to Hank?
I'll tell you what,

02:30.816 --> 02:32.316
I'll do it tonight,
okay? But today

02:32.350 --> 02:34.519
is Mommy and Daddy's
first day back at work.

02:34.553 --> 02:36.020
Go, go, go, go get
dressed, okay?

02:43.495 --> 02:44.962
Hey, hey, welcome back!

02:44.996 --> 02:46.630
Hey, thanks, good
to see you, man.

02:46.664 --> 02:48.197
So, listen, listen, I
talked to the divers, okay?

02:48.232 --> 02:49.380
They went through the pond.

02:49.404 --> 02:50.756
There's no sign
of weapons or I.D.

02:50.757 --> 02:52.202
Whoa, whoa, you don't
need to jump right in.

02:52.236 --> 02:54.203
I know you've been through a lot...
Talking about?

02:54.238 --> 02:56.873
It's great to be here. We're
back. I'm going back to work!

02:56.908 --> 02:58.207
Huh?
Hey, hey, listen, Booth, before you go in...

02:58.242 --> 03:00.410
Okay.

03:00.445 --> 03:04.246
BOOTH:
Whoa. Wow. What happened here?

03:04.280 --> 03:07.450
You do remember retiring, right?

03:07.484 --> 03:09.452
Yeah, I just,
that, uh... this...

03:09.486 --> 03:11.286
this has been my office
for years.

03:11.321 --> 03:13.989
HR said they'd
find you something amazing.

03:14.023 --> 03:15.624
You know, if it's a problem,
we can, uh...

03:15.659 --> 03:16.959
No, no problem.

03:16.993 --> 03:19.527
Okay? I'm fine, I'm good.

03:19.562 --> 03:21.362
No problem at all.

03:21.396 --> 03:24.532
This is good for a fresh
start. Look at these, huh?

03:24.567 --> 03:27.301
Moving up in the
world, huh, pal?

03:27.336 --> 03:30.371
Yeah, you know,
I even got my own mini fridge.

03:30.405 --> 03:32.373
You got a mini fridge? Okay,
let's get back to work.

03:32.407 --> 03:34.308
Yeah. (clears throat)
Right, okay, sorry.

03:34.343 --> 03:36.810
So I was thinking--
a fish farm

03:36.845 --> 03:39.045
is a pretty unique place
for a body dump. Plus,

03:39.080 --> 03:41.482
not everyone knows that
trout are carnivorous.

03:41.516 --> 03:44.317
Farm there's out in the boonies,
so whoever dumped the body

03:44.352 --> 03:46.820
definitely knew of the location.
I'll check out their log books,

03:46.855 --> 03:49.155
see if we can figure out
who's been coming and going.

03:49.190 --> 03:50.357
Yeah, you should do that.

03:56.730 --> 03:58.698
So, Dr. Brennan, is being back
at the Jeffersonian

03:58.732 --> 03:59.999
just like riding a bike?

04:00.033 --> 04:03.002
Uh, conducting
a forensic examination

04:03.036 --> 04:05.838
bears no resemblance
to riding a bicycle.

04:05.873 --> 04:08.140
Though both are activities
I greatly enjoy.

04:08.174 --> 04:11.309
Well... would you
like to do the honors?

04:11.343 --> 04:13.444
Oh, yes! Please.

04:16.616 --> 04:20.519
I really have missed this.
(giggles)

04:22.955 --> 04:25.123
(laughs)

04:26.692 --> 04:29.827
Okay. All right,
lower it.

04:29.861 --> 04:31.328
Okay.

04:31.362 --> 04:33.130
BRENNAN:
I talked to Booth.

04:33.164 --> 04:35.699
Based on the drag marks
at the site,

04:35.734 --> 04:38.536
he thinks the victim
was transported

04:38.570 --> 04:40.771
to the pond for disposal.

04:40.805 --> 04:42.472
Booth's back at work today, too?
Yes.

04:42.507 --> 04:44.774
His brother's death
was traumatic,

04:44.808 --> 04:48.711
but a routine can be healing
in times of stress.

04:48.746 --> 04:52.481
Uh, speaking of,
how is Arastoo's job search?

04:52.516 --> 04:55.618
I wouldn't know.

04:55.653 --> 04:57.787
Arastoo and I
are taking a break.

04:57.821 --> 05:01.157
Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.

05:01.191 --> 05:02.390
I hope my return

05:02.425 --> 05:05.360
to the Jeffersonian
was not a factor.

05:08.464 --> 05:11.800
You coming back is what
the Jeffersonian needed.

05:13.369 --> 05:15.971
The prominent
supra-orbital ridge

05:16.005 --> 05:18.073
suggests the victim
was male.

05:18.107 --> 05:19.807
And the wear
on the mandibular teeth

05:19.841 --> 05:21.809
indicates he was in his 40s.

05:21.843 --> 05:22.910
BRENNAN:
There's a great deal of damage

05:22.945 --> 05:23.911
to the mandible.

05:23.946 --> 05:25.913
It appears to be perimortem.

05:25.948 --> 05:28.315
Uh, same with the fractures
to the right tibia and fibula.

05:28.349 --> 05:30.250
Perhaps they were caused
by the same implement?

05:30.285 --> 05:32.086
But we won't be certain

05:32.120 --> 05:34.655
until we recover the missing
pieces of the mandible.

05:34.690 --> 05:38.424
Fish predation to the organs
and flesh is extensive.

05:38.459 --> 05:40.159
HODGINS:
That is because

05:40.194 --> 05:41.595
<i>Oncorhynchus Mykiss--</i>

05:41.629 --> 05:42.963
otherwise known
as rainbow trout--

05:42.997 --> 05:44.631
are total carnivores.

05:44.665 --> 05:46.766
And this variety
was bred to eat fast

05:46.801 --> 05:48.134
and grow fast.

05:48.168 --> 05:49.970
They are perfect
for fish farming.

05:50.004 --> 05:52.005
So, why are they here?

05:52.039 --> 05:54.439
Well, these little fellas
were actually feeding

05:54.474 --> 05:55.975
on the victim
when he was hauled out.

05:56.009 --> 05:57.810
BRENNAN:
Dr. Hodgins,

05:57.844 --> 06:00.479
are you positing that
the missing mandible fragments

06:00.513 --> 06:03.115
are inside those fish?

06:03.149 --> 06:04.416
That's my theory.

06:04.450 --> 06:07.419
And I intend to retrieve them

06:07.453 --> 06:09.121
by any means necessary.

06:45.442 --> 06:49.460
Well, there's something unusual
about this predation.

06:49.879 --> 06:52.180
Having the victim's flesh
nibbled off by trout

06:52.214 --> 06:54.249
isn't exactly normal.
True.

06:54.283 --> 06:56.117
But the fish
seemed to have eaten

06:56.151 --> 06:57.352
several of the victim's

06:57.386 --> 06:59.220
internal organs entirely,

06:59.255 --> 07:00.688
while others were left intact.

07:00.722 --> 07:02.123
BRENNAN:
I have never seen that before.

07:02.157 --> 07:03.891
Can you detect any pattern?

07:03.925 --> 07:05.525
Not yet.

07:05.559 --> 07:08.195
But I did find several cut marks
on the flesh.

07:08.229 --> 07:10.563
There's one here and one in
the upper abdominal region.

07:10.598 --> 07:13.233
BRENNAN:
I also found

07:13.268 --> 07:15.369
several small nicks
to the cortical bone

07:15.403 --> 07:18.738
on the left tenth
and 11th ribs.

07:18.773 --> 07:20.140
Knife wounds to the chest
could mean

07:20.174 --> 07:21.740
the victim
was stabbed to death.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.742
SAROYAN: The predation seems
particularly aggressive

07:23.777 --> 07:25.978
in the regions
closest to the stab wound.

07:26.013 --> 07:28.180
It's possible the blood
from the wound

07:28.215 --> 07:29.748
drew the fish
to those areas first.

07:29.783 --> 07:32.351
BRAY: I'll take a Mikrosil mold
of the nicks

07:32.386 --> 07:34.820
to see if I can identify
the weapon that caused it.

07:34.854 --> 07:35.988
You may not need to.

07:36.023 --> 07:39.090
BRAY:
The tip of the knife.

07:39.125 --> 07:40.358
It's lodged
in the victim's tenth rib.

07:40.393 --> 07:41.826
Yeah, it probably
broke off

07:41.860 --> 07:43.194
during the stabbing.

07:43.229 --> 07:44.762
Mr. Bray, please remove
the knife remnant

07:44.797 --> 07:46.431
and give it to Dr. Hodgins
so he can identify

07:46.465 --> 07:49.534
the weapon it came from.

07:55.307 --> 07:57.274
Any luck with the Missing
Persons Database?

07:57.309 --> 07:58.708
Well, I was able
to narrow it down.

07:58.743 --> 08:02.112
But without the missing
chunks of the mandible,

08:02.147 --> 08:03.447
it's hard to get
an exact match.

08:03.481 --> 08:05.615
Well, maybe this will help.

08:05.650 --> 08:07.151
MONTENEGRO:
Ew.

08:07.185 --> 08:09.686
Is that a mustache?
Part of one.

08:09.720 --> 08:11.788
It's almost all that was left
of the victim's facial tissue.

08:11.823 --> 08:15.325
All right, I think I have
a match for that somewhere.

08:15.359 --> 08:17.693
Hodgins and I
were wondering

08:17.727 --> 08:20.129
if you wanted to join us
for dinner tomorrow night?

08:20.164 --> 08:22.165
Thanks for the invitation,

08:22.199 --> 08:24.033
but I've-I've got plans.

08:24.068 --> 08:27.303
I know how hard weekends
can be after a breakup.

08:27.338 --> 08:29.004
Really, I'm fine.

08:29.038 --> 08:30.538
Okay.

08:30.573 --> 08:33.207
Uh, let's give
this updated image a whirl.

08:37.913 --> 08:40.849
SAROYAN: Thank God
for handlebar mustaches...

08:40.883 --> 08:43.352
is something I never
thought I'd say.

08:43.385 --> 08:45.520
Okay, so this is Lloyd Nesbit.

08:45.554 --> 08:47.721
Apparently, reported
missing by his assistant.

08:47.755 --> 08:49.923
Assistant in what?

08:49.958 --> 08:51.558
Um...

08:53.395 --> 08:57.098
Okay, well, it looks like
Nesbit was an inventor.

08:57.132 --> 09:00.001
Seems like the only invention
that took off though

09:00.035 --> 09:02.303
was this, the, uh, Flexi-Box.

09:02.337 --> 09:05.305
That was way back
in the '90s, though.

09:05.339 --> 09:07.707
ANNOUNCER:
Introducing the Flexi-box!

09:07.741 --> 09:09.342
MONTENEGRO:
I guess that's Nesbit.

09:09.377 --> 09:10.810
The indestructible mailbox

09:10.844 --> 09:13.179
that is taking
the nation by storm!

09:13.214 --> 09:16.483
You can try smashing it.

09:16.517 --> 09:18.318
You can try
crushing it.

09:18.352 --> 09:20.352
But nothing...

09:20.387 --> 09:23.688
Nothing, I mean nothing
destroys the Flexi-box.

09:23.723 --> 09:25.524
Aw, man!

09:25.558 --> 09:27.359
I used to love this commercial.

09:27.394 --> 09:29.794
Of course you did.

09:29.829 --> 09:31.630
So, that Flexi-Box is
the last hit Nesbit had?

09:31.664 --> 09:33.132
That's one hell of
a sophomore slump.

09:33.166 --> 09:34.900
HODGINS: Hey, you
got to admire

09:34.934 --> 09:36.735
to admire the guy for never
giving up on his dream, right?

09:36.769 --> 09:38.869
Even in the face of failure.

09:38.904 --> 09:41.139
Oh, no.
Honey, you're not on that again.

09:41.173 --> 09:42.873
Cam, you got to take
a look at this photo

09:42.908 --> 09:46.077
that Angie took and tell me
that that is not amazing.

09:46.111 --> 09:48.646
Wow, impressive.
Right?

09:48.680 --> 09:51.082
Yeah, I've just started,
but I really like it.

09:51.116 --> 09:52.716
Which is why I don't want

09:52.751 --> 09:55.052
to ruin the magic by putting

09:55.086 --> 09:56.319
my work out there
just yet.

09:56.354 --> 09:57.921
But your photos
are incredible, Angie.

09:57.955 --> 10:00.090
Thank you,
but you're not exactly

10:00.124 --> 10:01.391
an art critic, so...

10:01.426 --> 10:02.892
No, but if I showed

10:02.927 --> 10:04.594
your work to
a professional photographer,

10:04.628 --> 10:06.363
I guarantee you they'd say
the exact same thing.

10:06.397 --> 10:08.398
Don't you dare!

10:11.068 --> 10:12.768
They lost Jared's ashes?
There's got to be

10:12.802 --> 10:14.442
a law against that;
I'm gonna make a call.

10:14.471 --> 10:16.205
I got it handled,
Aubrey, thanks.

10:16.239 --> 10:18.107
Okay, but this is the last thing
you should be dealing with.

10:18.141 --> 10:19.708
I'm here to help.
Appreciate it.

10:19.742 --> 10:21.210
Look at all this junk.
I know, isn't it amazing?

10:21.244 --> 10:22.878
Sign me up for one
of these things.

10:22.912 --> 10:25.214
BOOTH: I thought you already
had an exercise machine.

10:25.248 --> 10:26.549
Oh, I thought it was for rotisserie chicken.
Chicken?

10:26.583 --> 10:27.950
How do you get chicken
out of that?

10:27.984 --> 10:29.117
I don't understand.
Where would you put chicken?

10:29.151 --> 10:30.285
AUBREY:
Tim Diffley?

10:30.319 --> 10:32.053
How you doing? FBI.

10:32.088 --> 10:34.289
Special Agent James Aubrey.
This is my partner...

10:34.323 --> 10:36.958
Special Agent Seeley Booth.
Please tell me

10:36.992 --> 10:39.461
this doesn't mean that Lloyd is...
I'm afraid it does.

10:39.495 --> 10:42.197
Lloyd Nesbit was found dead
earlier today.

10:42.231 --> 10:43.864
I can't believe it.

10:43.899 --> 10:46.366
Well, you did report him missing.
Yeah, I was hoping

10:46.401 --> 10:47.901
that he was injured or sick.

10:47.935 --> 10:49.570
Not that I wanted
those things to happen,

10:49.604 --> 10:51.572
but anything's better
than this.

10:51.606 --> 10:53.207
Nesbit was murdered.

10:53.241 --> 10:55.041
Can you think of anyone
who might have had

10:55.076 --> 10:56.543
a reason to harm him?
God, no.

10:56.578 --> 10:58.645
Lloyd was a wonderful man.
He was my mentor.

10:58.679 --> 10:59.980
Mentor, right.
So, we did

11:00.014 --> 11:01.681
check out your tax returns--
turns out

11:01.716 --> 11:04.484
Mr. Wonderful
had given you a raise <i>once</i>

11:04.518 --> 11:06.152
over the past six years, right?

11:06.186 --> 11:07.686
Money isn't
everything.

11:07.721 --> 11:10.323
I got a place to work,
I-I got advice.

11:10.357 --> 11:12.057
Trust me, I got a lot

11:12.092 --> 11:13.392
out of this
relationship.

11:13.427 --> 11:14.893
And now you've got
the inventions

11:14.928 --> 11:16.496
that you stole from your mentor.

11:16.530 --> 11:18.998
Right. You did, uh,
register a patent

11:19.032 --> 11:20.532
for jewelry polish, uh,

11:20.566 --> 11:22.534
on the day that <i>you</i>
<i>reported him missing.</i>

11:22.568 --> 11:24.002
The jewelry polish

11:24.036 --> 11:25.837
had nothing to do with Lloyd.

11:25.871 --> 11:28.873
It was entirely my own invention.
So Mr. Nesbit allows you

11:28.907 --> 11:30.708
to create your own stuff
here in his lab?

11:30.743 --> 11:32.110
Lloyd taught me
to never give up.

11:32.145 --> 11:33.612
He always said,
"You never know

11:33.646 --> 11:36.080
what an invention has
the potential to become."

11:36.115 --> 11:38.549
Still, a man's got to eat.
For me, doing what I love

11:38.583 --> 11:40.951
alongside a visionary
like Lloyd...

11:40.985 --> 11:43.254
it was payment enough.

11:43.288 --> 11:45.289
♪

11:49.093 --> 11:51.462
Hey. So, uh, Andie
and I were wondering

11:51.496 --> 11:54.430
if you wanted to join us
for a movie tonight.

11:54.465 --> 11:57.300
Why is it that every
happy couple I know

11:57.334 --> 11:59.169
treats me like I'm broken

11:59.203 --> 12:01.371
now that I'm not
in a relationship?

12:01.405 --> 12:03.239
I was... just trying to help.

12:03.274 --> 12:05.341
Well, perhaps you can help

12:05.376 --> 12:07.377
by focusing on the case.
Of course.

12:07.411 --> 12:10.012
There's no signs
of remodeling to the bones...

12:10.047 --> 12:12.814
and... these flesh wounds
don't appear

12:12.848 --> 12:15.250
to have any scarring.
Lack of extravasation

12:15.285 --> 12:18.086
and infiltration
of the incised tissue indicate

12:18.120 --> 12:21.089
that they were made postmortem.
So he was stabbed by somebody

12:21.123 --> 12:23.592
after he was already dead?
HODGINS: Those aren't stab marks.

12:23.626 --> 12:25.260
They're surgical incisions.

12:25.295 --> 12:27.562
I traced the tip of the
blade that Brennan found.

12:27.596 --> 12:28.896
It's a scalpel.

12:28.930 --> 12:31.399
That explains the pattern
I see emerging.

12:31.433 --> 12:34.502
This is the incision a surgeon would make
when removing a liver.

12:34.536 --> 12:37.572
Yeah, and these are for the kidneys.
HODGINS: So the fish didn't eat

12:37.606 --> 12:39.907
Nesbit's liver and kidneys--
they were already removed

12:39.941 --> 12:41.409
<i>before</i> he was
dumped in the pond.

12:41.443 --> 12:43.344
SAROYAN: Someone harvested
this man's

12:43.378 --> 12:44.711
internal organs.

12:45.979 --> 12:47.447
(sighs)

12:50.768 --> 12:52.768
All right listen,
I've got stats from the FBI.

12:52.793 --> 12:54.852
Okay? Turns out that the
illegal organ trade is

12:54.952 --> 12:57.321
a booming business.
That's not surprising to me.

12:57.421 --> 13:00.657
Right now, in America,
there are over 120,000 people

13:00.757 --> 13:02.357
on the transplant
waiting list,

13:02.391 --> 13:04.126
many of whom will die

13:04.160 --> 13:07.129
unless they purchase an organ illegally.
Aha, so you think

13:07.163 --> 13:09.698
that it's okay just to go out
and purchase a kidney.

13:09.732 --> 13:11.231
Well, legalizing
the sale of organs

13:11.266 --> 13:13.200
would eliminate the need
for the black market

13:13.234 --> 13:15.136
and save many lives.
Never happens.

13:15.170 --> 13:17.805
Once money is involved, people,
they start lining their pockets,

13:17.839 --> 13:20.808
right, greasing palms with other
people and they end up dead,

13:20.842 --> 13:23.811
like Nesbit.
Oh, people sell blood,

13:23.845 --> 13:26.313
men sell sperm,
women sell their eggs.

13:26.347 --> 13:28.214
There's even a vibrant,
growing market

13:28.248 --> 13:30.316
for the sale of donor feces.
Feces?

13:30.350 --> 13:32.752
Why would anyone want <i>that?</i>
<i>Donor feces</i>

13:32.787 --> 13:36.056
can be used to correct
C. difficile issues

13:36.090 --> 13:38.124
and are vital to the intestinal health...
Scratch that.

13:38.159 --> 13:40.727
Forget I even asked.
Hold on, let me see what this...

13:40.761 --> 13:42.628
(scoffs)
Great.

13:42.663 --> 13:44.130
(slams phone down)

13:44.165 --> 13:45.263
(groans)

13:45.298 --> 13:46.732
Problem with the case?
No, no,

13:46.766 --> 13:48.567
it's the mortuary, okay?

13:48.601 --> 13:51.070
They can't seem to
locate Jared's ashes.

13:51.104 --> 13:53.638
They don't know
where they are.

13:53.673 --> 13:55.074
(sighs)

13:55.108 --> 13:56.775
How can I help, Booth?

13:56.810 --> 13:58.177
You can't help me.

13:58.211 --> 13:59.544
Well, you're
clearly upset.

13:59.579 --> 14:01.379
How can I be there
for you in your grief

14:01.414 --> 14:03.047
if you won't let me in?
This is not grief, okay?

14:03.082 --> 14:05.049
This is me being pissed
that my brother's being

14:05.084 --> 14:07.384
more of a pain in the ass
dead than he was alive.

14:07.419 --> 14:10.421
There's a difference, okay?

14:14.893 --> 14:16.894
Hey, you wanted
to show me something?

14:16.929 --> 14:18.895
Guess what I found
in the trout tank.

14:18.930 --> 14:21.064
Something only you could love?

14:21.099 --> 14:24.067
They're <i>hydropsychidae</i>
<i>caddisfly larvae.</i>

14:24.102 --> 14:26.236
Look at that--
blowflies of the deep.

14:26.270 --> 14:27.570
They were eating the body?
Yeah.

14:27.605 --> 14:29.072
And based on their size,

14:29.107 --> 14:30.774
I put time of death at
about eight days ago.

14:30.808 --> 14:32.109
Okay, I'll let Aubrey know.

14:32.143 --> 14:33.576
Hey, hang on, um, Angie.

14:33.611 --> 14:34.931
There's... there's
something else.

14:36.000 --> 14:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:43.519 --> 14:47.923
You arranged a show for me
at Founding Fathers?

14:47.958 --> 14:50.926
And it's tonight?

14:50.961 --> 14:52.927
Well, you wouldn't have agreed
if I'd given you advance notice.

14:52.962 --> 14:54.963
I'm not agreeing now.
Come on, Angie.

14:54.997 --> 14:56.297
I just sent out
a few postcards.

14:56.331 --> 14:57.598
To whom?

14:57.633 --> 14:58.599
No one, really.

14:58.634 --> 15:01.069
Family, friends.

15:01.103 --> 15:02.837
Couple of art galleries.

15:02.872 --> 15:04.839
You know, dozen or so
AP photojournalists...

15:04.874 --> 15:06.908
Wait, you did what?

15:06.942 --> 15:09.244
Well, you would not take my
word for how good you are,

15:09.278 --> 15:11.245
so I decided to enlist
a few professionals.

15:11.279 --> 15:13.881
Hodgins, you have to cancel
this thing immediately.

15:21.322 --> 15:23.757
That is correct,
Mr. Bray.

15:23.792 --> 15:26.760
The chipping on the left and
right calcaneus bones lines up

15:26.794 --> 15:29.128
with the marks on the tissue
I found on both heels.

15:29.163 --> 15:31.931
So in addition to harvesting
Nesbit's liver and kidneys,

15:31.965 --> 15:34.700
they also took
his Achilles tendons.

15:34.734 --> 15:36.702
And possibly his corneas.

15:36.736 --> 15:38.971
I also found incisions
and soft tissue damage

15:39.006 --> 15:40.973
around his orbital sockets.
Huh.

15:41.008 --> 15:43.975
Dr. Saroyan, take a look
at these striations

15:44.010 --> 15:45.977
on the internal aspect
of the lateral arch

15:46.012 --> 15:48.180
on the left 11th rib.

15:50.183 --> 15:52.150
Those could not be
caused by a scalpel.

15:52.185 --> 15:54.152
They appear to be
perimortem.

15:54.187 --> 15:57.088
Have Dr. Hodgins swab the
wounds for particulates.

15:57.123 --> 15:59.490
If we can identify the
weapon that caused these,

15:59.525 --> 16:02.259
it might lead us
to our killer.

16:02.294 --> 16:04.661
MONTENEGRO: <i>So I've spent</i>
<i>the last few hours</i>

16:04.696 --> 16:07.597
surfing all the top sites
on the Dark Web.

16:07.632 --> 16:10.000
You would not believe
what people sell on here.

16:10.035 --> 16:13.603
Drugs, child pornography,
human organs.

16:13.638 --> 16:15.439
Basically, it's a black
market Craigslist.

16:15.473 --> 16:16.841
Yeah.

16:16.875 --> 16:18.842
If our killer harvested
everything possible,

16:18.876 --> 16:21.544
they could have made more
than a half million dollars.

16:21.578 --> 16:23.346
You got any suspects?

16:23.380 --> 16:27.050
Well, there are all sorts of
brokers from all over the world,

16:27.084 --> 16:30.353
but this one,
"the Matchmaker,"

16:30.387 --> 16:32.722
sold, uh, a pair of
corneas, kidneys,

16:32.756 --> 16:37.092
a liver, pancreas and two
Achilles tendons eight days ago.

16:37.126 --> 16:38.260
Well, those are
the same body parts

16:38.294 --> 16:39.427
that were taken
off our victim.

16:39.462 --> 16:41.263
Exactly.

16:41.297 --> 16:44.566
The problem is the Dark Web
browsers are super-encrypted,

16:44.600 --> 16:46.568
so it'll be next to
impossible to track down

16:46.602 --> 16:50.038
the Matchmaker's IP address,
let alone who they are

16:50.073 --> 16:52.039
and where they live.

16:52.074 --> 16:53.407
I think I might have a way

16:53.441 --> 16:55.076
to lure this one
out of the shadows.

16:56.578 --> 16:58.812
WOMAN:
<i>Are you Jimmy?</i>

16:58.847 --> 17:00.214
I am.

17:00.249 --> 17:01.215
And you came alone?

17:01.250 --> 17:02.884
Just like you told me.

17:02.918 --> 17:04.550
I followed all your instructions.
Good, good.

17:04.586 --> 17:06.553
Trust is very important.

17:06.588 --> 17:09.021
Yeah, but how do I know
that I can trust you?

17:09.056 --> 17:12.025
I mean, I'm the one that's
giving up a lobe of my liver.

17:12.059 --> 17:14.394
You're doing a good thing.

17:14.428 --> 17:16.596
You're saving someone's life.

17:16.630 --> 17:18.464
Can you at least tell me how
much money I'm gonna get?

17:18.499 --> 17:20.901
A young healthy man
like yourself?

17:20.935 --> 17:24.069
A lobe of liver
is worth 50 grand.

17:24.105 --> 17:25.771
How-how soon can
I get the money?

17:25.806 --> 17:27.772
I guarantee
that you will leave

17:27.807 --> 17:29.241
that medical facility
cash in hand.

17:29.276 --> 17:32.244
Now, should we start
working on a date?

17:32.279 --> 17:34.246
You know, actually,

17:34.281 --> 17:36.648
I think your calendar's gonna
be booked up for a while.

17:36.682 --> 17:38.984
Special Agent
James Aubrey, FBI.

17:39.019 --> 17:41.420
See, that was just
a theoretical conversation.

17:41.454 --> 17:43.254
No actual
transaction occurred.

17:43.289 --> 17:45.156
Yeah, we found the money
trail connecting you

17:45.190 --> 17:47.158
to Lloyd Nesbit's organs.
Who?

17:47.192 --> 17:49.160
You know, the guy that you
murdered and stripped for parts?

17:49.194 --> 17:50.461
(scoffs)

17:50.495 --> 17:52.297
Well, now,
that's ridiculous.

17:52.331 --> 17:54.999
I want the names of every
surgeon that you work with.

17:55.034 --> 17:56.234
Absolutely not.

17:56.268 --> 17:57.735
Uh, what we do is
too important.

17:57.769 --> 17:59.737
Yeah.

17:59.771 --> 18:01.571
Maybe you'll feel
more like talking

18:01.605 --> 18:03.573
after spending a
few days in lockup.

18:03.607 --> 18:06.009
So why don't
you stand up?

18:06.044 --> 18:08.245
Put your hands behind
your back, please.

18:08.279 --> 18:10.280
Up we go.

18:24.149 --> 18:25.849
Booth?

18:25.883 --> 18:27.017
Bones.

18:27.051 --> 18:28.452
What are you
doing here?

18:28.486 --> 18:30.454
I have the information
you requested.

18:30.488 --> 18:32.456
Why are you sitting
at Aubrey's old desk?

18:32.490 --> 18:33.857
(grunts)
You know.

18:33.891 --> 18:35.526
(banging)
Only temporary.

18:35.560 --> 18:37.528
No big deal.

18:37.562 --> 18:39.862
I disagree.

18:39.896 --> 18:41.531
You lost your brother,
you nearly died.

18:41.565 --> 18:43.265
Shouldn't you be in an office
that gives you privacy?

18:43.300 --> 18:44.701
I'll be fine.

18:44.735 --> 18:46.302
It's just temporary,
okay? Thank you.

18:46.337 --> 18:47.870
And I don't need you
to come here, checking on me,

18:47.904 --> 18:49.706
pretending it's about work.
I'm not pretending.

18:49.740 --> 18:51.774
Although,

18:51.809 --> 18:54.777
I must say, your behavior does
nothing to assuage my concern.

18:54.812 --> 18:55.944
(Booth sighs)

18:58.013 --> 18:59.815
All right, look, I'm sorry.

18:59.849 --> 19:01.216
I'm sorry I snapped at you.

19:01.250 --> 19:03.051
It's just...

19:03.085 --> 19:04.886
there's a lot going on
in here, all right?

19:04.920 --> 19:06.421
Can we just focus on the case?

19:07.990 --> 19:09.958
Angela went through the database

19:09.992 --> 19:12.793
of people waiting
for transplants

19:12.828 --> 19:14.628
to see who was recently
taken off the waiting list.

19:14.663 --> 19:16.063
That's great--
potential suspects.

19:16.097 --> 19:17.898
It certainly
is more efficient

19:17.932 --> 19:19.734
to kill for a new organ

19:19.768 --> 19:21.736
than to spend months
or even years

19:21.770 --> 19:23.103
on a waiting list.

19:23.137 --> 19:24.905
Why are there
only six suspects?

19:24.939 --> 19:27.307
Those are the only people
who are a match

19:27.342 --> 19:31.110
for Nesbit's blood type
and human leukocyte antigen.

19:31.144 --> 19:33.913
It's about transplant
compatibility.

19:33.947 --> 19:37.917
The killer had access
to Nesbit's medical records,

19:37.951 --> 19:40.820
and I think I know who that is.

19:40.855 --> 19:45.258
Okay, don't tell me that
this little girl is our killer.

19:45.292 --> 19:47.292
Not her. Her father,
Rodney Dale.

19:48.395 --> 19:50.796
You're right.

19:50.830 --> 19:54.199
Dale worked doing data entry
at the insurance company

19:54.233 --> 19:56.034
where Nesbit had
medical coverage.

19:56.068 --> 19:57.503
Right, I wouldn't put
anything past a guy

19:57.537 --> 19:58.897
whose daughter was
on death's door.

20:01.508 --> 20:03.841
You mind telling me
what this is about?

20:03.876 --> 20:05.843
The kidney that saved
your daughter's life,

20:05.878 --> 20:08.479
a man named Lloyd Nesbit
was murdered for it.

20:08.514 --> 20:09.847
You don't think I...?

20:11.182 --> 20:12.216
I-I would never...

20:12.250 --> 20:13.651
You were desperate,
Mr. Dale.

20:13.685 --> 20:15.052
Lauren was dying,

20:15.086 --> 20:16.521
so you combed through
the files at work

20:16.555 --> 20:18.155
till you found someone
who was a match for her,

20:18.189 --> 20:19.156
then you killed him.

20:19.190 --> 20:20.657
You got this all wrong.

20:20.691 --> 20:22.659
We also looked
into your financials.

20:22.693 --> 20:24.494
Lauren's health issues
put you deep in debt.

20:24.529 --> 20:26.863
So once she had her new kidney,

20:26.898 --> 20:29.032
you figured you might
as well cash in on the rest

20:29.066 --> 20:31.367
of Nesbit's organs to pay off
her medical bills.

20:31.402 --> 20:33.603
Uh, that's not how it went.

20:35.406 --> 20:37.407
She would have died
on that waiting list.

20:39.409 --> 20:41.744
So I went online...

20:41.778 --> 20:44.212
and bought a kidney.

20:44.247 --> 20:46.882
But I had no idea anybody
was killed for it.

20:46.917 --> 20:49.852
Who performed your daughter's
transplant, Mr. Dale?

20:51.588 --> 20:55.256
I can save you some jail time
if you tell me who did it.

20:55.290 --> 20:56.658
I can't.

20:56.692 --> 20:59.360
Lauren has
Wilson's disease.

20:59.394 --> 21:01.329
The new kidney helps,

21:01.363 --> 21:03.865
but down the road,
her pancreas might fail.

21:03.899 --> 21:07.268
That surgeon saved
my daughter's life once.

21:07.302 --> 21:09.838
I may need him
to do it again some day.

21:09.872 --> 21:12.305
And you do realize that

21:12.340 --> 21:15.375
you're obstructing an
investigation into the murder

21:15.409 --> 21:18.078
of a man whose kidney
is inside your daughter.

21:23.250 --> 21:26.820
I'm sorry, Agent Aubrey.

21:30.256 --> 21:32.291
Hey, you got those mandibular
fragments ready for me?

21:32.325 --> 21:34.627
I wish, but the only thing
these fish are pooping is poop.

21:34.661 --> 21:36.161
Why is this one separated
from the others?

21:36.196 --> 21:38.130
Well, he's my Guinea pig.

21:38.164 --> 21:40.800
I'm thinking that if these fish
aren't gonna defecate the bones,

21:40.834 --> 21:42.568
maybe they'll regurgitate them.

21:42.603 --> 21:44.069
Bulimic trout.
Interesting.

21:44.104 --> 21:46.004
Well, I just fed them
some octocoral diterpenoid

21:46.038 --> 21:50.408
to speed up
the process, and... Oh!

21:50.442 --> 21:52.811
There it is. Eh?
Yeah.

21:52.845 --> 21:55.146
Now, all I have to do
is feed some of that

21:55.180 --> 21:58.483
to the rest of them,
and there will be more

21:58.518 --> 22:02.420
where this came from.
Great. So, Angela

22:02.454 --> 22:04.254
told me about the photo show.

22:04.288 --> 22:06.456
Really? Yeah? Does that mean
she's finally on board with it?

22:06.491 --> 22:07.825
More like the opposite.

22:07.859 --> 22:09.426
She wants to cancel,

22:09.460 --> 22:11.261
but she feels like
you're not really hearing her.

22:11.295 --> 22:13.998
So she sent you here
to talk me out of it.

22:14.032 --> 22:15.766
Wendell, listen,

22:15.800 --> 22:17.601
I know my own wife,
and trust me,

22:17.636 --> 22:19.003
by the end of the night,

22:19.037 --> 22:20.603
Angela is going
to be thanking me.

22:20.638 --> 22:22.104
If you say so.

22:22.139 --> 22:24.607
Hey, did you ever
get the swab results

22:24.642 --> 22:26.509
from the nick on the eleventh rib?
Oh, you know,

22:26.544 --> 22:28.344
the mass spec never
came up with anything.

22:28.378 --> 22:30.980
But hold on. I
got an idea here.

22:33.483 --> 22:35.018
All right,
so, there's no

22:35.052 --> 22:38.186
trace particulates,
but wait a second here.

22:38.220 --> 22:40.488
There are some unusual
skin cells.

22:40.523 --> 22:42.724
Since when are skin cells
in a wound unusual?

22:42.759 --> 22:45.160
Since they don't match
the pigment of our victim.

22:45.194 --> 22:47.495
So they belong to someone else?

22:47.530 --> 22:50.198
Let's find out.

22:50.232 --> 22:51.700
Okay, so this is
a blown-up image

22:51.734 --> 22:53.868
of the mark on
the eleventh rib.

22:53.902 --> 22:55.937
If I can extrapolate
the measurements,

22:55.971 --> 22:58.606
we should be able
to figure out what made it.

22:58.640 --> 23:01.175
It's a screw.
No.

23:01.209 --> 23:03.310
It's not.
It's a trocar button.

23:03.344 --> 23:05.512
Morticians use them
to close up holes

23:05.547 --> 23:07.014
during the embalming process.

23:07.049 --> 23:10.617
Oh. So it's possible the
surgeon was a mortician?

23:10.651 --> 23:12.652
This is all starting
to make sense to me now.

23:12.687 --> 23:14.156
Can you pull up the image
of the victim's torso?

23:14.180 --> 23:15.055
Yeah.

23:15.056 --> 23:17.757
(beeping)
Okay, the kidneys

23:17.792 --> 23:20.660
are attached to the tenth
and eleventh ribs by fascia,

23:20.695 --> 23:22.495
which has a really
strong adhesion.

23:22.529 --> 23:26.165
So, when the scalpel broke
off in the victim's tenth rib,

23:26.200 --> 23:28.166
the surgeon-- or
the mortician--

23:28.201 --> 23:30.669
grabbed whatever sharp-edged
tool he could find.

23:30.704 --> 23:32.938
I'll call Booth.
Right.

23:32.973 --> 23:36.041
(phone chimes)
Oh!

23:36.076 --> 23:38.510
Looks like we
got a DNA match

23:38.544 --> 23:40.679
on the extra
skin cells.

23:40.714 --> 23:42.681
They're from a victim

23:42.716 --> 23:46.350
of a fatal drive-by
shooting ten days ago.

23:46.384 --> 23:47.719
Oh, that's great!

23:47.753 --> 23:49.687
Well, if we can find
the mortician

23:49.722 --> 23:51.956
who handled her funeral, looks
like we've found our surgeon.

23:51.991 --> 23:54.458
BRENNAN:
<i>Booth, are you sure</i>

23:54.493 --> 23:58.295
going to a funeral home is the
best thing for you right now?

23:58.330 --> 24:00.431
The mortician's
a suspect, Bones.

24:00.465 --> 24:03.399
Well, I meant
because of Jared.

24:03.434 --> 24:04.835
This has nothing to
do with him, okay?

24:04.869 --> 24:07.004
It's about the case.
It's only natural

24:07.038 --> 24:10.240
that being in a mortuary could
stir up feelings of grief.

24:10.274 --> 24:12.676
All right, look, this is not
some emotional breakdown, okay?

24:12.710 --> 24:14.778
I just want to find
my brother's ashes.

24:14.812 --> 24:17.514
Jared is gone, Booth.

24:17.548 --> 24:19.682
His ashes are merely
a physical representation

24:19.716 --> 24:21.617
of the man he was.
Okay, look,

24:21.652 --> 24:23.352
maybe that's all
they are to you,

24:23.386 --> 24:25.087
okay, but to me,
that's my brother.

24:25.122 --> 24:28.090
His life was troubled
enough, all right?

24:28.125 --> 24:31.226
The least I can do is
help him rest in peace.

24:35.898 --> 24:39.600
Made you a coffee
just like you like it.

24:39.635 --> 24:42.436
Well, if you're trying to
soften me up about the show,

24:42.471 --> 24:43.938
it's not working.

24:43.973 --> 24:47.108
Actually, I came
to apologize.

24:47.143 --> 24:49.644
I know your photography is
really personal to you,

24:49.679 --> 24:52.780
and I shouldn't have
put you on the spot like that.

24:52.814 --> 24:54.648
I'm sorry, Angie.

24:54.683 --> 24:57.084
Thank you.
Whatever I've done,

24:57.118 --> 25:00.154
I can undo it.

25:01.956 --> 25:06.626
They really are beautiful,
and I'm just so proud of you.

25:08.096 --> 25:10.763
Thank you.

25:12.766 --> 25:16.602
Well, you <i>did</i> soften me up.

25:22.109 --> 25:25.277
Hey, uh, don't undo it.

25:25.312 --> 25:26.778
What?

25:26.813 --> 25:30.949
Uh, I'm... I'm okay
with the show.

25:30.983 --> 25:32.617
Really?

25:32.651 --> 25:34.019
Oh, Angie,

25:34.053 --> 25:35.620
this is gonna be great.

25:35.654 --> 25:37.355
I'm just gonna send
one more e-mail blast

25:37.389 --> 25:38.790
reminding people
to bring their checkbooks.

25:38.825 --> 25:40.125
I... Uh, Hodgins?

25:40.159 --> 25:41.793
Or we can just see
who shows up.

25:41.828 --> 25:44.361
(sighs)

25:44.395 --> 25:45.796
BRENNAN: Booth?
BOOTH:  <i>Yeah.</i>

25:45.831 --> 25:47.798
BRENNAN:
<i>Funeral's in session.</i>

25:47.833 --> 25:49.834
Look, at least we got to
talk to the mortician.

25:49.868 --> 25:52.136
We'll be in and out, nobody will
even know that we're here, hmm?

25:52.170 --> 25:53.637
Thank you for coming.

25:53.671 --> 25:56.073
Uncle Willie would be
so happy you're here.

25:56.108 --> 25:58.275
Oh, no, we-we're not here...

25:58.309 --> 25:59.744
To mourn Uncle Willie.

25:59.778 --> 26:01.811
We're here to celebrate
his life, right?

26:01.846 --> 26:03.479
Yes, of course.

26:03.513 --> 26:05.782
Why did you pretend
we knew the deceased?

26:05.816 --> 26:07.316
These people are
in mourning, okay?

26:07.351 --> 26:09.619
This day should be
about them. Look.

26:09.653 --> 26:11.154
That must be Vargas,
the mortician.

26:11.188 --> 26:13.223
Just play it cool.

26:13.257 --> 26:15.125
Can I help you?

26:15.159 --> 26:16.659
Yeah, I need to ask
you a few questions.

26:16.693 --> 26:18.727
We're about to begin
the service.

26:18.762 --> 26:20.129
Please show some respect.

26:20.163 --> 26:21.563
The same respect you
had for Lloyd Nesbit?

26:21.597 --> 26:23.232
I don't know who
you're talking about.

26:23.266 --> 26:25.300
How did that man die?
Shh!

26:25.334 --> 26:27.335
He died in his sleep. Why?

26:27.370 --> 26:28.804
What is it, Bones?

26:28.838 --> 26:29.972
His upper abdominal area

26:30.006 --> 26:32.474
appears

26:32.508 --> 26:34.576
unusually deflated
for someone

26:34.610 --> 26:36.477
with his bone structure
and musculature.

26:36.511 --> 26:38.146
What-what do you
think you're doing?

26:38.180 --> 26:39.814
Excuse me, this will just
take a second.

26:39.848 --> 26:41.582
Ma'am, please step away

26:41.616 --> 26:42.850
from the coffin, ma'am!

26:42.885 --> 26:44.652
Ah-ha!

26:44.686 --> 26:46.854
Just as I suspected.

26:46.889 --> 26:48.289
Okay.
(gasps)

26:48.323 --> 26:49.757
Okay, Bones, probably not

26:49.792 --> 26:51.192
the best place to
do this right now.

26:56.955 --> 26:58.524
Once in awhile...

26:58.549 --> 27:01.750
I took a body part
from a client.

27:01.785 --> 27:03.353
Who was I hurting?

27:03.387 --> 27:04.854
They weren't gonna
use it anyway.

27:04.888 --> 27:07.523
What about the people
that they left behind?

27:07.557 --> 27:09.859
What they didn't know
didn't hurt them,

27:09.893 --> 27:12.028
and perhaps they would
appreciate the fact

27:12.062 --> 27:13.363
that their loved ones
helped others stay alive.

27:13.397 --> 27:14.530
I think you got greedy,

27:14.564 --> 27:16.199
Vargas.

27:16.233 --> 27:17.699
Not every corpse
that comes your way

27:17.733 --> 27:20.268
can be harvested for parts,
so you went out

27:20.303 --> 27:21.769
and found your
own fresh meat.

27:21.804 --> 27:23.705
That's a ridiculous assumption.

27:23.739 --> 27:25.540
A murder victim goes
through your chop shop.

27:25.574 --> 27:28.310
Now you're saying you're not
the one that killed him?

27:28.344 --> 27:30.645
The body was delivered
by a trusted friend.

27:30.679 --> 27:32.147
I was told the man died
in a car accident.

27:32.181 --> 27:34.215
Let me guess, that friend's name
is Nina Slocum?

27:35.484 --> 27:37.118
I never heard of her.
Really?

27:37.152 --> 27:39.853
'Cause I got phone records
that say otherwise.

27:43.191 --> 27:46.627
(sighs)

27:46.661 --> 27:48.795
You want me to talk?

27:48.830 --> 27:51.297
FBI must drop all charges
against me.

27:51.332 --> 27:52.965
Really?

27:53.000 --> 27:54.567
Is that all you want?

27:54.601 --> 27:55.735
No.

27:55.769 --> 27:57.637
I want it in writing.

27:57.671 --> 27:59.572
(sighs)

27:59.606 --> 28:01.241
Sorry, Vargas.

28:01.275 --> 28:03.743
Guys like you do not get
a free pass.

28:03.777 --> 28:05.578
(door opens)

28:05.612 --> 28:06.679
(door closes)

28:09.149 --> 28:10.849
BRAY: I finished reassembling
the mandible, Dr. B.

28:10.883 --> 28:12.617
You were right.

28:12.652 --> 28:15.454
This impact was clearly
caused by blunt-force trauma.

28:15.488 --> 28:18.790
Oh, Vargas told Aubrey
the victim was hit by a car.

28:18.824 --> 28:21.493
Please measure
the points of impact, Mr. Bray,

28:21.528 --> 28:23.628
so we can identify the object
that struck the victim.

28:23.663 --> 28:26.164
Judging from the
curvature of the wound,

28:26.198 --> 28:28.366
a car is a definite possibility.

28:28.400 --> 28:31.302
And these measurements
are an exact match

28:31.336 --> 28:32.870
to the fractures
on the victim's legs.

28:32.904 --> 28:34.539
HODGINS: I got results
from swabbing the mandible.

28:34.573 --> 28:37.841
So, I found traces of steel,
aluminum oxide,

28:37.876 --> 28:40.811
petroleum distillates
and silicone emulsifiers.

28:40.845 --> 28:42.645
Were those consistent with an automobile?
Uh, yeah,

28:42.680 --> 28:45.048
all of these are common
ingredients in car polish.

28:45.083 --> 28:47.684
It appears that Vargas
was telling the truth.

28:47.718 --> 28:50.053
So the car hit Nesbit
in the leg,

28:50.088 --> 28:51.854
knocking him down.

28:51.889 --> 28:53.390
Then once he was on the ground,

28:53.424 --> 28:54.724
it smashed him in the jaw

28:54.758 --> 28:56.493
and killed him.

28:56.527 --> 28:58.228
You found cause of death?

28:58.262 --> 29:00.796
Based on the splintering
of the right frontal aspect

29:00.830 --> 29:04.400
of the mental eminence,
it appears

29:04.434 --> 29:07.470
a large shard
of the victim's own mandible

29:07.504 --> 29:08.837
lacerated his submental artery.

29:08.871 --> 29:10.639
I'll get these measurements

29:10.673 --> 29:13.509
to Angela and see if she can
find a match for the vehicle.

29:21.183 --> 29:22.417
What's this?

29:22.451 --> 29:23.818
I sent some texts out

29:23.852 --> 29:25.086
to the delivery company
and they found this

29:25.121 --> 29:26.154
in the back of the warehouse.

29:26.188 --> 29:27.589
The labels are gone,

29:27.623 --> 29:28.823
but it's the right
weight and size

29:28.857 --> 29:30.425
for Jared's ashes.

29:30.459 --> 29:32.026
Look, Aubrey, I told you
that I would take care of this.

29:32.060 --> 29:34.194
Come on,
you'd do the same for me.

29:34.229 --> 29:37.231
(sighs)

29:41.736 --> 29:43.737
(sighs)

29:46.741 --> 29:48.742
Thanks. Appreciate it.

30:01.087 --> 30:03.656
Marmalade.

30:09.828 --> 30:11.463
I'm really sorry, Booth.

30:11.497 --> 30:13.231
It's okay, Aubrey.
You know what, you tried.

30:13.266 --> 30:15.634
I appreciate it.
(phone rings)

30:15.668 --> 30:17.169
Well, if it makes
you feel any better,

30:17.203 --> 30:18.703
Angela found the
make and model

30:18.737 --> 30:20.338
of the car that killed Nesbit.

30:20.373 --> 30:21.973
Nina Slocum's car is a match.

30:22.007 --> 30:23.041
Aubrey,
why don't you just...

30:23.075 --> 30:24.308
take this one,

30:24.342 --> 30:25.909
and I'll circle back to you.

30:28.880 --> 30:31.014
(sighs)

30:32.850 --> 30:34.552
Please don't tell me
there's a grown man

30:34.586 --> 30:36.187
digging through my trash
right now.

30:36.221 --> 30:37.821
Apple fig.

30:37.855 --> 30:39.856
It's high quality marmalade.

30:41.358 --> 30:44.026
(whistles)

30:44.061 --> 30:46.563
Oh, okay,
this is Nina Slocum's car.

30:46.597 --> 30:48.498
Is it a match for the car
that hit Nesbit?

30:48.532 --> 30:50.667
Yeah, well,
it's a definite possibility.

30:50.701 --> 30:52.168
No damage to the bumpers.

30:52.203 --> 30:53.769
She could have
had it replaced.

30:53.804 --> 30:55.471
Huh.

30:55.506 --> 30:56.806
Looks like it's been
freshly detailed.

30:56.840 --> 30:59.541
She could be trying
to hide something.

30:59.576 --> 31:00.975
Whoa.

31:01.010 --> 31:04.213
Yeah, a whole lot of blood.

31:06.216 --> 31:08.517
AUBREY: <i>We took</i>
<i>a look at your car, Nina.</i>

31:08.551 --> 31:11.486
And we found Nesbit's blood
in the back of it.

31:11.521 --> 31:13.388
So that's not proof
I'm a murderer.

31:13.423 --> 31:14.856
Also did some digging.

31:14.890 --> 31:16.824
Turns out that you
grew up down the road

31:16.858 --> 31:17.991
from the fish farm

31:18.026 --> 31:19.327
where Nesbit's body was dumped.

31:19.361 --> 31:20.528
Okay, fine.

31:20.562 --> 31:22.730
So I threw his body in the pond,

31:22.764 --> 31:24.865
but after his organs
were properly distributed.

31:24.899 --> 31:26.567
Are you still claiming
that you didn't kill him?

31:26.602 --> 31:28.035
Of course I didn't.

31:28.069 --> 31:31.539
I'm in the business of
saving lives, not ending them.

31:33.741 --> 31:37.377
Nesbit's body was brought to me.

31:37.411 --> 31:39.045
And I just couldn't
bear the thought

31:39.079 --> 31:41.881
of all those viable organs
going to waste.

31:41.915 --> 31:43.250
Who brought you the body?

31:43.284 --> 31:47.053
Look, whoever you're
protecting here, Nina,

31:47.087 --> 31:49.222
you are not doing yourself
any favors.

31:49.256 --> 31:52.991
Maybe not. But the work I do
is a matter of life and death.

31:53.025 --> 31:55.827
And if my donors learn
that they can't trust me,

31:55.862 --> 31:59.365
then I won't be able
to save lives.

31:59.399 --> 32:03.034
Yeah, you're a real angel
of mercy, protecting a murderer.

32:03.069 --> 32:06.104
Mm. Perhaps you're just
too young to understand this,

32:06.139 --> 32:10.675
Agent Aubrey,
but doing the right thing

32:10.709 --> 32:13.878
is rarely the same
as doing the easy thing.

32:20.753 --> 32:23.654
I'm beginning to think this is
a case where nobody wins.

32:23.688 --> 32:25.889
How is that, Mr. Bray?

32:25.923 --> 32:28.292
If we prove that Nina Slocum's
guilty of Nesbit's murder

32:28.326 --> 32:30.960
and lock her up, then
we're basically handing over

32:30.995 --> 32:33.897
a death sentence to a bunch
of people who need organs.

32:33.931 --> 32:35.231
Our job is to
apprehend a murderer,

32:35.266 --> 32:36.900
regardless of the
repercussions.

32:36.934 --> 32:38.735
(sighs softly)

32:38.770 --> 32:40.469
Something is troubling

32:40.504 --> 32:42.338
about the blunt force
trauma to the mandible.

32:42.372 --> 32:43.639
I triple-checked my work.

32:43.674 --> 32:45.641
My initial measurements
were accurate.

32:45.676 --> 32:48.911
It's not the size of the wound,
it's the angle.

32:48.945 --> 32:51.414
In order for this shard
of mental eminence

32:51.448 --> 32:56.185
to puncture the victim's artery,
the blunt force trauma

32:56.219 --> 32:58.853
would have to have been made
in a downward sweeping angle.

32:58.887 --> 33:00.922
But that angle
wouldn't make sense

33:00.956 --> 33:02.924
if the victim was hit by a car.
Exactly.

33:02.958 --> 33:05.159
Were you able to detect
any bone bruising

33:05.194 --> 33:08.596
to the occipital,
ulnas or the sacrum?

33:08.631 --> 33:10.832
Three for three.

33:10.866 --> 33:13.267
All injuries that are consistent
with falling backwards

33:13.302 --> 33:15.168
after being hit
by a moving vehicle.

33:15.203 --> 33:18.939
I am no longer convinced the
victim was struck by a car.

33:18.973 --> 33:22.943
I'll need Angela to recreate
the trauma in greater detail.

33:22.977 --> 33:25.312
MONTENEGRO: So I've run
multiple simulations

33:25.347 --> 33:27.348
of Nina Slocum's car
hitting Nesbit,

33:27.382 --> 33:30.851
but there's no scenarios
where her car

33:30.885 --> 33:32.985
could cause that injury.

33:33.019 --> 33:34.954
I thought Nina's bumper
was a match for the wounds

33:34.988 --> 33:36.622
to Nesbit's leg and jaw.

33:36.657 --> 33:38.290
In size, yes,

33:38.325 --> 33:40.326
but the angle of impact
doesn't match.

33:40.361 --> 33:42.829
Maybe Nina didn't use
her own car.

33:42.863 --> 33:44.497
Okay, well, here are
all the makes and models

33:44.531 --> 33:47.500
of cars that match
the victim's wounds.

33:47.534 --> 33:50.001
The placement of the injuries
makes sense,

33:50.035 --> 33:52.337
but the momentum of being hit
by one of these vehicles

33:52.372 --> 33:53.772
would have caused
a lot more damage.

33:53.806 --> 33:57.008
So Nesbit wasn't hit by a car.

33:57.042 --> 33:59.611
But he may have been
hit with a piece of one.

33:59.645 --> 34:00.846
What about the bumper guard?

34:00.880 --> 34:01.980
I don't know what that is.

34:02.014 --> 34:03.114
It's an accessory.

34:03.148 --> 34:04.949
It's that thing right there.

34:04.984 --> 34:06.784
Let me see what happens
when I remove

34:06.818 --> 34:08.318
the bumper guard
from the vehicle.

34:10.321 --> 34:11.955
Is it possible
to place the bumper guard

34:11.989 --> 34:13.956
in an assailant's hands?

34:13.992 --> 34:17.293
Okay. Assailant avatar
coming up.

34:17.328 --> 34:19.864
If the killer used the bumper
guard to hit Nesbit in the leg,

34:19.898 --> 34:22.465
it could've caused him
to fall backwards.

34:22.500 --> 34:25.101
BRENNAN: And then,
when he's on the ground,

34:25.135 --> 34:28.271
the killer struck him
in the jaw with

34:28.304 --> 34:31.040
a downward sweeping motion,
killing him.

34:31.074 --> 34:34.010
It works.

34:34.043 --> 34:36.045
Looks like we found
our murder weapon.

34:39.858 --> 34:40.610
Booth!
Yeah.

34:40.635 --> 34:42.632
Just the man I'm looking for.
Uh, listen--

34:42.632 --> 34:44.433
Hold on, let me just grab
something off my desk.

34:44.467 --> 34:45.935
What the hey?

34:45.969 --> 34:47.937
Where's... where is
Bobblehead Bobby,

34:47.971 --> 34:50.304
and who's moving my
stuff without asking me?

34:51.908 --> 34:54.576
This is
what I wanted to show you.

34:54.610 --> 34:56.610
BOOTH:
Oh, wow.

34:59.448 --> 35:01.049
Look at this, huh?

35:01.083 --> 35:02.918
This is great.

35:02.952 --> 35:04.419
Huh?

35:04.453 --> 35:07.187
(chuckles)

35:07.221 --> 35:09.590
You're sure you're okay with this, right?
Come on, what do you think,

35:09.624 --> 35:12.092
I'm gonna steal an office from
the guy who taught me everything I know?

35:12.126 --> 35:14.762
So you gonna move
out back in the bullpen?

35:14.796 --> 35:16.436
Yeah, I got myself
some new digs upstairs.

35:16.464 --> 35:17.765
Corner office, view of the Mall.

35:17.799 --> 35:19.600
Oh, Mr. Big Shot, huh?

35:19.634 --> 35:22.436
Here I was worried, you know,
what you would do without me.

35:22.470 --> 35:24.503
Well, learned from the best.

35:24.538 --> 35:25.705
Well, yeah...

35:25.739 --> 35:27.941
(phone ringing)

35:27.975 --> 35:29.943
You got something, Bones?

35:29.977 --> 35:31.544
Nesbit wasn't killed by a car,

35:31.579 --> 35:33.512
he was killed by someone
wielding a metal bumper guard.

35:33.547 --> 35:36.115
Nina Slocum's car didn't
have one of those.

35:36.149 --> 35:38.517
Yeah, so the bumper
could've come from anywhere.

35:38.552 --> 35:40.386
Which means we're back at square one.
No, no, no, hold on.

35:40.420 --> 35:41.519
Hodgins said
there was car polish

35:41.554 --> 35:43.021
found in the wound, right?

35:43.056 --> 35:44.790
Yes, but I don't see
how that helps us.

35:44.824 --> 35:45.991
Don't worry, I got this one.

35:48.795 --> 35:49.928
What's that?

35:49.963 --> 35:51.463
That's your jewelry polish.

35:51.497 --> 35:53.465
Lab found traces of it
in the victim's jaw.

35:53.499 --> 35:54.967
What happened, Tim, huh?

35:55.001 --> 35:56.468
Nesbit wasn't a big fan
of your polish,

35:56.502 --> 35:57.835
so you tried repurposing it
into a car polish?

35:57.869 --> 35:59.837
AUBREY:
Just like Nesbit taught you,

35:59.871 --> 36:01.672
"never give up on anything."

36:01.707 --> 36:04.308
Lloyd hated it as a car polish

36:04.342 --> 36:06.543
as much as he hated it
as a jewelry polish.

36:06.578 --> 36:09.146
That's why you hit Nesbit
with the bumper guard

36:09.180 --> 36:11.348
and you killed him.
No, that's not true.

36:11.382 --> 36:13.317
Come on, Tim, Tim.
Help us out here, okay?

36:13.351 --> 36:16.519
Because we got a check here
for $30,000

36:16.553 --> 36:18.321
that you gave to your boss.

36:18.355 --> 36:19.990
I'm pretty sure
we know where that came from.

36:20.024 --> 36:21.390
I don't know
what you're talking about.

36:21.425 --> 36:22.993
Lift up your shirt.
What?

36:23.027 --> 36:24.560
Lift your shirt up,
unless you want me to get

36:24.595 --> 36:26.635
a warrant so I can look
at your stomach. Lift it up!

36:28.265 --> 36:30.433
AUBREY:
Wow.

36:30.467 --> 36:32.868
Gave up your right kidney
to fund your boss's work.

36:32.902 --> 36:35.104
That's what I call job devotion.

36:35.138 --> 36:37.873
He said it was the only way
that I could keep my job.

36:37.907 --> 36:39.742
And I was so sure

36:39.776 --> 36:42.377
that our big payday was
right around the corner.

36:42.411 --> 36:45.047
Yeah, well, that day never came,
so you hit him.

36:45.081 --> 36:47.282
It was an accident.
Maybe it was an accident,

36:47.316 --> 36:49.416
but you know what,
selling off his organs

36:49.451 --> 36:51.719
to Nina Slocum,
that wasn't an accident.

36:51.754 --> 36:54.555
He was dead.

36:54.589 --> 36:56.157
I was just trying
to make something good

36:56.191 --> 36:57.992
out of what happened.

36:58.027 --> 37:00.828
So you hacked up your dead
boss's body to make a profit.

37:00.863 --> 37:02.830
No, to save lives.

37:02.865 --> 37:05.366
To make up for the
one that I took.

37:05.400 --> 37:06.767
Isn't that worth anything?

37:15.242 --> 37:17.477
Hey, do you have a minute?

37:17.511 --> 37:21.048
Uh, please, come
in, Dr. Saroyan.

37:21.082 --> 37:22.882
(sighs)

37:22.916 --> 37:26.385
I, um...
I just wanted to say

37:26.419 --> 37:29.221
that I don't blame you for what
happened between me and Arastoo.

37:29.255 --> 37:31.891
Nor should you.

37:31.925 --> 37:36.228
I am finding it hard to accept
that I may have to choose

37:36.262 --> 37:39.565
between my relationship
and my job.

37:39.599 --> 37:42.667
That's not an easy dilemma.

37:42.702 --> 37:45.403
And everyone's being
so kind to me,

37:45.437 --> 37:49.174
and I... I miss Arastoo.

37:49.208 --> 37:50.575
But...

37:50.609 --> 37:53.311
you know,
what bothers me most

37:53.345 --> 37:56.714
is that I may actually be
okay with it.

37:56.748 --> 38:01.118
I mean, choosing work
over Arastoo.

38:01.152 --> 38:04.988
And it makes you feel guilty?

38:05.023 --> 38:07.925
Wouldn't you?

38:09.994 --> 38:12.763
Doesn't mean
you made the wrong choice.

38:18.836 --> 38:22.004
♪

38:31.748 --> 38:33.882
MONTENEGRO:
See?

38:33.916 --> 38:36.184
Told you nobody
would come.

38:36.219 --> 38:37.352
What do you mean?

38:37.386 --> 38:38.553
Look, there's Aubrey.

38:38.587 --> 38:40.355
Look, Cam and
Wendell made it.

38:40.389 --> 38:41.857
Wow, three whole people.

38:41.891 --> 38:43.225
And four if you count

38:43.259 --> 38:44.525
that homeless guy.

38:44.560 --> 38:46.027
Come on.

38:46.062 --> 38:47.062
AUBREY:
Angela, hey.

38:47.096 --> 38:48.896
Great show.
Thanks.

38:48.930 --> 38:52.133
Let me guess. The aged Camembert
is your favorite, right?

38:52.167 --> 38:53.367
What? No.

38:53.401 --> 38:54.969
It's the black
and white one

38:55.003 --> 38:57.171
with the light and the trees.

38:57.205 --> 38:59.473
What? Come on.
Guy can't enjoy a little culture

38:59.507 --> 39:00.707
with his free cheese?

39:00.742 --> 39:02.843
Oh, hey, guys.

39:02.878 --> 39:04.478
Nice work, Angela.

39:04.512 --> 39:05.879
You put on quite a show.

39:05.913 --> 39:08.648
HODGINS: Whoa,
Angie, check it out.

39:08.682 --> 39:11.017
Your photography is
selling like hotcakes.

39:11.051 --> 39:12.485
Look at this.

39:12.519 --> 39:14.553
It's, like,
practically a bidding war.

39:14.588 --> 39:16.589
Yeah, except I recognize
this handwriting.

39:16.623 --> 39:19.392
Hodgins put you guys
up to this, didn't he?

39:19.426 --> 39:21.694
We were just trying
to get things started.

39:21.728 --> 39:23.195
SAROYAN:
Mm-hmm.

39:23.229 --> 39:25.764
Oh, who signed
Sebastian Kohl's name?

39:25.799 --> 39:27.732
That's just cruel.

39:27.767 --> 39:29.067
I didn't do that.

39:29.102 --> 39:30.368
Don't look at me.

39:30.403 --> 39:31.536
HODGINS:
Sebastian Kohl.

39:31.570 --> 39:33.205
Why do I know that name?

39:33.239 --> 39:35.207
He's a world-famous
photojournalist,

39:35.241 --> 39:36.608
two-time Pulitzer Prize winner.

39:36.642 --> 39:38.043
That is just mean.

39:38.077 --> 39:39.877
Seriously, Angie,
I did not do that,

39:39.912 --> 39:43.080
but I did drop off all those
postcards at the A.P. offices.

39:43.115 --> 39:44.949
What makes you think
Sebastian Kohl

39:44.983 --> 39:47.618
would come to a place
like Founding Fathers?

39:47.652 --> 39:49.220
You think this is bad,

39:49.254 --> 39:50.988
you should check out
the bar scene in Dakar.

39:53.125 --> 39:55.559
Sebastian Kohl.

39:55.593 --> 39:57.694
And you must be Ms. Montenegro.

39:57.728 --> 39:59.429
Oh, wow.

39:59.463 --> 40:00.864
It's really you.

40:00.898 --> 40:01.865
(chuckles)

40:01.899 --> 40:03.266
Please excuse the outfit.

40:03.301 --> 40:04.968
I just touched down
after a month-long trek

40:05.002 --> 40:07.204
in Cambodia
when I received this.

40:07.238 --> 40:08.138
See?

40:08.172 --> 40:09.605
Uh... (laughs)

40:09.640 --> 40:11.875
I'm-I'm really honored
to meet you.

40:11.909 --> 40:13.775
Um, I-I can't believe
that you came.

40:13.810 --> 40:15.211
How could I miss
an opportunity

40:15.245 --> 40:18.280
to see more work
by the artist who took this?

40:18.315 --> 40:20.149
Oh, yeah,
that's a, um...

40:20.183 --> 40:22.784
I'm just starting
in this photo thing.

40:22.819 --> 40:23.819
Embrace it.

40:23.854 --> 40:26.121
Do you mind

40:26.156 --> 40:27.656
shipping this photo to me?

40:27.690 --> 40:28.958
I'm heading off on assignment
in the morning.

40:28.992 --> 40:31.059
I mean, of course. Yes.

40:31.093 --> 40:32.793
I-I'll... anything.

40:32.828 --> 40:34.329
I'll hand-deliver it to you.

40:34.363 --> 40:35.563
(chuckles)
Wherever you are.

40:35.597 --> 40:36.630
That may be difficult.

40:36.665 --> 40:38.466
I'm going to Syria.

40:38.500 --> 40:41.002
But you could send it
to this address.

40:41.036 --> 40:42.337
Okay.

40:42.371 --> 40:44.339
Thank you for coming.
Of course.

40:44.373 --> 40:45.506
Safe travels.

40:45.540 --> 40:46.940
Thank you.

40:51.412 --> 40:54.614
So should I say it now
or later?

40:54.648 --> 40:56.049
Fine.

40:56.084 --> 40:57.284
You told me so.

40:57.318 --> 40:59.953
I did, didn't I?

40:59.988 --> 41:02.089
(laughs)

41:06.393 --> 41:07.793
Bones, will you...
Shh-shh.

41:07.827 --> 41:09.628
What?
The kids are asleep.

41:09.662 --> 41:11.297
But there's something
you need to see.

41:11.331 --> 41:14.633
Okay.

41:14.667 --> 41:17.403
Christine wanted to have
a sleepover with Hank.

41:19.406 --> 41:22.374
Wow. Look at that, huh?

41:22.408 --> 41:23.408
She even made him
little pictures, huh?

41:23.442 --> 41:26.378
BRENNAN:
Yes, but that's not

41:26.412 --> 41:28.046
what I wanted you to see.

41:28.080 --> 41:31.116
It's how she got
in and out of Hank's crib.

41:31.150 --> 41:33.751
It's the box.

41:35.421 --> 41:38.722
You want to open it?

41:38.756 --> 41:40.424
Maybe later.

41:40.458 --> 41:42.893
I thought you'd be glad
to find Jared's ashes.

41:42.928 --> 41:45.296
No, I am. It's just, you know,
you were right, Bones.

41:45.330 --> 41:48.565
Look, this wasn't about
finding Jared's ashes,

41:48.599 --> 41:52.269
this was about
my brother being gone.

41:53.371 --> 41:56.406
I know how much you miss him.

41:58.542 --> 42:01.510
Let's go. I don't want
the kids to wake up.

42:01.545 --> 42:03.546
You want to take the box?

42:03.580 --> 42:06.049
No, I tell you what,
why don't we just

42:06.083 --> 42:09.585
leave it here so she can visit
her brother in the morning.

42:12.422 --> 42:15.290
Girl really loves her brother,
doesn't she?

42:15.325 --> 42:17.993
Yes, she does.
