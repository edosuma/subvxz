01:18.412 --> 01:19.678
-You saw that?
-Yeah!

01:19.680 --> 01:22.147
Yo, that nigga jammed it
on his dome, man.

01:22.149 --> 01:23.415
-Yo, man.

01:23.417 --> 01:25.217
I told you to stop saying
stupid shit like that.

01:25.219 --> 01:26.985
-I'm a minority.
I can say what I want.

01:26.987 --> 01:28.620
And that nigga dunked it
on his head.

01:28.622 --> 01:30.589
-You can't say shit like that.
You not a nigga.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.157
You got it, nigga?

01:32.159 --> 01:34.660
-Whatever. Hey, man, we should
get a team and come out here.

01:34.662 --> 01:37.129
-Yeah, man, if you wanna get
killed, we can come out here.

01:37.831 --> 01:39.631
-Oh-oh, got it.

01:45.638 --> 01:48.107
-One of these guys supposedly
played with the nets for a year.

01:48.109 --> 01:49.274
I bet that's him.
-What?

01:49.276 --> 01:50.776
Back in the day with j-kidd,
right?

01:50.778 --> 01:53.212
No wonder that nigga is so nice.
-Yo, practice.

01:53.214 --> 01:55.214
-What did I just tell you
about saying that shit?

01:55.216 --> 01:56.682
-<i> Hey, yo, Saint.</i>
-Yeah?

01:56.684 --> 01:59.184
-Hey, you know if that coach
from Cornell is comin' again?

01:59.186 --> 02:00.619
-Yeah, I think so.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.354
-Alright.
-Hey, ant.

02:02.356 --> 02:05.057
You should Jack that move, yo,
show off your handle, you know?

02:05.059 --> 02:06.058
Ha! Ha! Ha!

02:06.060 --> 02:07.392
-Yo, watch that shit.

02:07.394 --> 02:08.994
How do you eat that
right before practice?

02:08.996 --> 02:10.461
-'Cause that nigga don't play,
that's why.

02:12.166 --> 02:15.234
-Shut up.
-"Shut up! Shut up!"

02:15.236 --> 02:17.035
-Man!

02:19.639 --> 02:22.474
-I'm gonna fucking kill you!
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

02:22.476 --> 02:25.210
-Why are you usin' me?
-Gonna kill you, bro!

02:25.212 --> 02:27.946
-Take it, take it!

02:27.948 --> 02:30.849
You don't wanna be last, hakim!
You don't wanna be last!

02:30.851 --> 02:32.751
-Muscle up!

02:32.753 --> 02:33.952
-Taste it!

02:33.954 --> 02:35.687
-Muscle up, muscle up!

02:35.689 --> 02:37.189
Stop!

02:39.527 --> 02:43.195
White, red.
Gimme, uh, five on the clock.

02:43.197 --> 02:44.663
We're gonna work the offense.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.798
Clean, crisp passes.

02:46.800 --> 02:50.002
Otherwise you will run
until you throw up.

02:50.004 --> 02:51.136
<i> Garbage can's in the corner.</i>

02:51.138 --> 02:52.271
-Yo.

02:52.273 --> 02:54.473
You heard jimenez dropped
42 last week?

02:54.475 --> 02:56.375
-So what?
Saint's done that before.

02:56.377 --> 02:58.644
-Yeah, but the whole team
had 50.

02:58.646 --> 03:00.412
-Well, I guess he didn't have
a lot of assists then, huh?

03:01.415 --> 03:03.081
-<i> Hey, Dunn.</i>

03:03.083 --> 03:05.684
Go red. And I want you
guarding Anthony.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.819
<i> Ian, you down there.</i>

03:07.821 --> 03:09.521
-Let's do this then,
motherfucker.

03:09.523 --> 03:12.191
-<i> Alright, hustle up.</i>
<i> Intensity, intensity.</i>
<i> Let's go.</i>

03:12.193 --> 03:14.459
-I got red.

03:14.461 --> 03:16.195
-<i> Come on, hakim, lead 'em.</i>

03:17.730 --> 03:19.298
<i> Let's go! Look alive!</i>
<i>- Keep movin', guys.</i>

03:19.300 --> 03:21.166
<i> Keep movin'.</i>

03:21.168 --> 03:22.901
-<i> There you go.</i>

03:22.903 --> 03:24.436
<i> Easy.</i>

03:26.273 --> 03:27.339
-I'm sorry.
-Alright, bitch.

03:27.341 --> 03:28.607
You'd better not get too tired.

03:28.609 --> 03:31.076
-Let's go. Let me see
some defense. Get low.

03:31.078 --> 03:32.244
-Hey, coach,
which should I run?

03:32.246 --> 03:33.712
-Golden state.
-Come on.

03:35.950 --> 03:38.116
-I'm coming for you!
Ah, fuck.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.420
-<i> Aah!</i>

03:41.422 --> 03:43.889
-Hey, Dunn,
Saint's lighting you up!

03:43.891 --> 03:45.591
<i> Play defense!</i>

03:45.593 --> 03:47.159
-That's fucking it for you!

03:47.161 --> 03:48.360
Right here. Right here.

03:51.864 --> 03:53.799
-<i> Way to go, Billy!</i>

03:53.801 --> 03:56.668
-<i> Hey, Saint, toughen up, man!</i>
-It's like all day!

03:56.670 --> 03:59.404
Ooh! Barbecued chicken, bitch!

03:59.406 --> 04:00.906
-We gotta get him
used to getting hit

04:00.908 --> 04:02.107
'cause everybody's
gonna do that.

04:02.109 --> 04:03.108
-Run the offense.

04:03.110 --> 04:04.109
-You're not even gonna see

04:04.111 --> 04:05.277
the fucking ball anymore.

04:05.279 --> 04:07.112
-Is that so?
-I'm like glue.

04:07.114 --> 04:09.615
Like white on rice.
Like me on your girl.

04:09.617 --> 04:11.984
-Come on, come on.
Swing it, swing it, swing it.

04:13.186 --> 04:15.954
-<i> There it is.</i>

04:15.956 --> 04:17.255
Hey, shooter..

04:17.257 --> 04:20.759
Shoot the ball, shooter!
He's gotta shoot that.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.427
-I know you're only passing it
'cause you're scared.

04:22.429 --> 04:23.595
Oh, I got the mouse!

04:23.597 --> 04:24.663
I got the mouse in the house!

04:24.665 --> 04:26.999
Mouse in the house!

04:27.001 --> 04:29.034
-Get on the floor!
Get on the floor, that's it!

04:34.774 --> 04:36.675
<i> Goddamnit, Billy!</i>

04:48.588 --> 04:50.756
-Hey, sorry I'm late, dad.
-Yeah.

04:50.758 --> 04:52.157
You gonna be able to record it?

04:52.159 --> 04:53.191
-Yeah, I'll do it on my phone.

04:53.193 --> 04:54.226
-No, it sounds like shit.

04:54.228 --> 04:55.327
Last time
i could barely hear it.

04:55.329 --> 04:56.995
-I'll plug it directly
into the mic.

04:56.997 --> 04:59.431
It'll be good. It'll be good.
-Yeah.

05:03.469 --> 05:04.603
Hello, everyone.

05:04.605 --> 05:07.873
Uh, tonight,
we will continue our series

05:07.875 --> 05:09.808
on fiction writing.

05:11.944 --> 05:15.614
Tonight's topic will be..

05:15.616 --> 05:18.216
"Bringing a character to life.

05:18.218 --> 05:21.687
<i> The novelist as midwife."</i>

05:21.689 --> 05:23.855
<i> Please help me welcome</i>
<i> professor Lee Keller.</i>

05:28.428 --> 05:30.896
-Thank you.
Thanks for your Patience.

05:30.898 --> 05:34.366
What goes into defining
a character?

05:36.836 --> 05:40.739
Is it their actions or..

05:44.677 --> 05:47.045
...is it what they feel inside?

05:48.581 --> 05:50.615
Hopefully in fiction, it's both.

05:50.617 --> 05:51.883
-<i> Were there a lot of people?</i>

05:51.885 --> 05:54.553
-Well, their advertising
budget is about enough

05:54.555 --> 05:58.757
for a bagel and a cup of coffee,
so surprise, there weren't.

05:58.759 --> 06:00.058
-Everybody was
pretty engaged though.

06:00.060 --> 06:01.159
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

06:01.161 --> 06:02.494
You should buy an iPad, dad.

06:02.496 --> 06:03.795
You could do
the slide show right

06:03.797 --> 06:05.831
from there and record it too.
It would look nice.

06:05.833 --> 06:06.865
It's really cool.
-Good idea.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.800
-And it'd probably be
on time too.

06:08.802 --> 06:10.369
Wouldn't it?

06:10.371 --> 06:12.304
<i> Right?</i>
-Yeah, probably.

06:12.306 --> 06:14.039
-Anybody from your class come?

06:14.041 --> 06:16.308
-What is this, an interview?
No.

06:16.310 --> 06:19.945
There wasn't a single, solitary
soul from my class.

06:21.180 --> 06:23.115
Maybe if I was lecturing
about how to tweet

06:23.117 --> 06:25.517
while instagramming,
they would be there.

06:25.519 --> 06:27.352
-I'd really like to learn
how to do that.

06:27.354 --> 06:29.421
-Oh, yeah? It's dead simple.
-Mm-hmm.

06:29.423 --> 06:32.190
-Let me tell you.
Blah, blah, blah.

06:33.426 --> 06:35.627
-So, um, it looks like
I'm gonna get

06:35.629 --> 06:37.028
that promotion
to senior manager.

06:37.030 --> 06:38.997
-No way.
-Yup.

06:38.999 --> 06:43.568
I mean, it'll mean weekends,
but the pay is good, so..

06:43.570 --> 06:45.270
-You charmed them into it,
didn't you?

06:45.272 --> 06:46.872
-I don't know.

06:49.675 --> 06:51.309
-I can't say I blame them.

06:57.417 --> 07:00.819
-So are you gonna tell me
what happened?

07:01.954 --> 07:03.855
-Elbow.
-Hmm.

07:05.158 --> 07:07.058
Billy?
-Yeah.

07:11.664 --> 07:14.166
Mom, I'm, I'm eating.

07:14.168 --> 07:18.170
-Well, he is aggressive,
but you need that on your team.

07:18.172 --> 07:19.204
-You have
like a burning desire

07:19.206 --> 07:20.439
to look at it from all sides?

07:20.441 --> 07:22.174
-I do. Hot, hot.

07:27.180 --> 07:29.247
-Hey, get up.

07:29.249 --> 07:31.817
I'm gonna show you
how to avoid being elbowed.

07:31.819 --> 07:32.818
-Lee.
-What?

07:32.820 --> 07:34.252
-Lee, we're, we're eating.

07:34.254 --> 07:35.720
-Come on,
it'll take ten seconds.
-Can you just..

07:35.722 --> 07:37.756
-Alright.
-<i> Alright.</i>

07:39.692 --> 07:42.961
So I'm you and you're bill.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.596
You got it?
-I got it.

07:44.598 --> 07:46.264
-So I'm the shooter. Right?

07:46.266 --> 07:47.766
And I'm the man, bro.

07:47.768 --> 07:49.901
You can't stop me. Right?

07:49.903 --> 07:51.803
I'm gonna light you up.

07:51.805 --> 07:52.804
-Jesus.

07:52.806 --> 07:53.939
-Oh, back it up.

07:53.941 --> 07:55.140
Back it up!

07:55.142 --> 07:58.276
Yeah, punk. Punk. Right?

07:58.278 --> 08:00.879
<i> So, uh, I got the ball,</i>
<i> you know, I'm gonna shoot.</i>

08:00.881 --> 08:02.280
<i> Where you gonna be?</i>
-I'm gonna be right here.

08:02.282 --> 08:04.649
-Oh, well,
what's Anthony gonna do?

08:04.651 --> 08:07.285
Huh? You gonna shoot it?

08:07.287 --> 08:08.553
-No, not with the defender
right here.

08:08.555 --> 08:09.788
-Wrong.

08:09.790 --> 08:12.624
You are gonna shoot it.
Like this.

08:12.626 --> 08:14.025
-Lee!
-Whoa.

08:14.027 --> 08:15.293
-Jesus.

08:15.295 --> 08:16.495
-That's not my foul.

08:16.497 --> 08:18.129
-Honey, you alright?
-I'm fine, I'm fine.

08:18.131 --> 08:20.699
-And nobody's ever gonna guard
you that close again.

08:20.701 --> 08:23.134
Guaranteed.

08:23.136 --> 08:25.103
-I'm gonna go
get you some ice.

08:27.907 --> 08:29.841
-Why are you getting him ice?
He said he's fine.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.116
Right?
-I'm, I'm fine.

08:38.118 --> 08:39.784
I don't need ice.

08:48.160 --> 08:49.761
-Take this, please.

08:57.270 --> 09:00.705
-So, um, what's going on
with your novel, dad?

09:00.707 --> 09:02.207
-<i> Well, I had</i>
<i> a major breakthrough.</i>

09:02.209 --> 09:05.644
I'm gonna rework
the entire beginning

09:05.646 --> 09:09.247
and give every character their
own chapter before they meet.

09:09.249 --> 09:10.882
-Hmm.
-Yeah.

09:10.884 --> 09:13.718
-That sounds great.
-Mm-hmm.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.220
-Does that mean
a lot more work?

09:15.222 --> 09:18.256
-It just means throwing
a bunch of shit out

09:18.258 --> 09:21.860
<i> but if you're afraid of work,</i>
<i> you're not a writer.</i>

09:24.664 --> 09:27.666
-<i> Yo, Saint, man,</i>
<i> Billy fucked you up.</i>

09:27.668 --> 09:29.768
-No, man, I'm good. I'm good.
-No, it's not good, man.

09:29.770 --> 09:32.070
If we don't got you, we don't
win, so he's gotta back off.

09:32.072 --> 09:33.605
-Or I'm gonna lay
that nigga out.

09:33.607 --> 09:35.574
-Hey, what'd I say about that,
man?

09:35.576 --> 09:37.342
-I mean -- I mean,
i will lay him out.
-Stop.

09:37.344 --> 09:39.210
Alright.
-Yo, hey, ant.

09:39.212 --> 09:41.446
Try to get us up by a lot on
Friday, alright, so I can get
in.

09:41.448 --> 09:43.315
Yo, my aunt Janice
is coming from tarrytown

09:43.317 --> 09:46.051
with her daughters,
and they are hot.

09:46.053 --> 09:47.552
-Whoa!
-So I want them
to see me play.

09:47.554 --> 09:49.254
-Yo, that shit is gross, man.
-What?

09:49.256 --> 09:50.455
-Those are your cousins, bro.

09:50.457 --> 09:51.523
-What?
-What's up?

09:51.525 --> 09:52.591
-No, it's not.
That's not true.

09:52.593 --> 09:54.292
-Yes, it is.
Those are your cousins.

09:54.294 --> 09:55.694
-Your aunt's kids
are your cousins, man.

09:55.696 --> 09:57.228
That's disgusting.
-Fucking idiot.

09:57.230 --> 09:58.296
Yo, how'd they let you
into this school?

09:58.298 --> 10:00.165
-Bitch, shut up.
-"Shut up!"

10:00.167 --> 10:01.666
I love that line.
That's like his signature.

10:01.668 --> 10:02.734
-<i> Anthony.</i>

10:03.302 --> 10:05.670
Can I see you?

10:05.672 --> 10:08.273
-Anthony. Hey.
-What's up?

10:08.275 --> 10:11.543
Um, I gotta go, alright?

10:11.545 --> 10:13.712
-Okay.
-"Anthony, can I see you?"

10:13.714 --> 10:14.846
"Come to my office, Anthony."

10:14.848 --> 10:17.649
-I'm as old as a dinosaur.

10:18.918 --> 10:20.685
-<i> So, uh..</i>

10:21.988 --> 10:24.055
...how you feeling
about the play-offs?

10:24.057 --> 10:26.124
-I feel good. Excited.

10:27.994 --> 10:30.629
-<i> And, uh, what's happening</i>
<i> on the college front?</i>

10:30.631 --> 10:32.397
-Hopefully, uh, Cornell.

10:32.399 --> 10:34.666
-Alright. That would be
a dream come true, right?

10:35.234 --> 10:36.868
-Yeah.

10:36.870 --> 10:39.671
-Listen, I don't like
involving students in this

10:39.673 --> 10:41.473
but we haven't received
your tuition check

10:41.475 --> 10:43.975
for second semester yet.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.810
I -- I wouldn't ask you, but, uh

10:45.812 --> 10:48.213
I haven't been able
to reach your parents.

10:48.215 --> 10:49.948
I'm sure they're just busy.

10:52.151 --> 10:53.318
-Yeah, I'm really sorry
about that.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.553
I will definitely let them know.

10:56.856 --> 10:57.956
-Alright, li -- listen

10:57.958 --> 10:59.958
we're really proud of you,
Anthony.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.177
-<i> So it's true.</i>

11:23.482 --> 11:26.251
That's your spot.

11:26.253 --> 11:29.654
I heard some tenth graders who
worship you talking about it.

11:29.656 --> 11:31.189
-Yeah, I guess it's my spot.

11:31.590 --> 11:33.758
Kind of.

11:33.760 --> 11:36.561
-You know, they come down here
and they pretend to be you.

11:38.297 --> 11:39.964
It's actually kind of lame.

11:39.966 --> 11:41.900
-As lame as having
to take gym as a senior?

11:43.002 --> 11:44.736
<i> I'm sorry.</i>

11:44.738 --> 11:46.404
<i> I'm sorry.</i>

11:51.510 --> 11:53.945
-What did Wilson want?
-Nothin'.

11:53.947 --> 11:55.480
He's just askin' how it's going.

11:56.449 --> 11:59.751
-Hmm. Everybody loves Anthony.

12:08.894 --> 12:10.528
How'd you get that?

12:18.003 --> 12:19.604
I -- I don't understand you.

12:28.848 --> 12:30.415
-I am sorry.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.253
-<i> For what?</i>

12:37.690 --> 12:39.624
-For bein' a shitty boyfriend.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.864
-You are a shitty boyfriend.
-Yeah, I just said --

12:45.866 --> 12:47.565
-yeah, but I wanted
to say it too.

12:59.845 --> 13:01.446
Just over here on the right.

13:15.427 --> 13:16.861
-I'll call you later, okay?

13:18.030 --> 13:19.430
-Yeah, right.

13:22.368 --> 13:24.836
-<i> The story</i>
<i> isn't without merit.</i>

13:24.838 --> 13:27.806
You know, there are some pretty
good descriptive passages.

13:27.808 --> 13:28.973
That's hard to do

13:28.975 --> 13:32.310
but your perspective
is all over the place.

13:34.647 --> 13:38.049
You know, it's fine
to shift perspective

13:38.051 --> 13:39.317
if you do it on purpose

13:39.319 --> 13:41.953
but what's not okay
is shifting perspective

13:41.955 --> 13:43.822
just because
you can't find another way

13:43.824 --> 13:45.290
to get your point across.

13:45.292 --> 13:47.258
-How do you know
i didn't shift on purpose?

13:47.260 --> 13:49.561
Like a definitive
stylistic choice?

13:49.563 --> 13:51.529
-I can only hope
you didn't do it on purpose

13:51.531 --> 13:52.964
based on what I read.

13:52.966 --> 13:55.433
-So you're saying your
interpretation of my material

13:55.435 --> 13:56.534
is more valid than my intention?

13:56.536 --> 13:58.036
I mean, that just doesn't seem
fair.

13:58.038 --> 14:00.405
-It's not fair? Oh, no.

14:00.407 --> 14:03.541
Well, at a certain point,
intention doesn't matter.

14:04.810 --> 14:06.744
It's about what you do.

14:18.090 --> 14:19.624
-<i> Yeah, I didn't wanna</i>
<i> stress out mom.</i>

14:19.626 --> 14:22.160
<i> I know she's working, like,</i>
<i> a thousand hours a week, so.</i>

14:22.162 --> 14:23.261
-Yeah, you did
the right thing.

14:23.263 --> 14:25.096
She'd probably just flip out.

14:26.599 --> 14:28.867
How dare they talk to you
about it?

14:28.869 --> 14:30.735
They said they, they couldn't
get in touch with you.

14:30.737 --> 14:32.337
That's all.

14:32.339 --> 14:34.205
It was just probably
a misunderstanding, so..

14:34.207 --> 14:36.207
-Hey, look, I'll take care
of it, alright?

14:36.209 --> 14:37.942
And I'll remind them
that you are the fucking star

14:37.944 --> 14:39.577
of their high school.

14:40.913 --> 14:44.415
-Leo!
-Micky. Hey.

14:44.417 --> 14:45.750
Yeah, stoli on the rocks

14:45.752 --> 14:48.286
and a coke with as many
maraschino cherries

14:48.288 --> 14:51.723
as you can cram
in the glass for this giant.

14:51.725 --> 14:54.225
-Your dad's been threatening
to bring me down to a game.

14:54.227 --> 14:56.027
-Last thing he needs
is your kind of luck.

14:56.029 --> 14:59.264
-But yours is welcome?
-Hey, you bet.

14:59.266 --> 15:01.499
-My favorite shooting guard!
-What's up, uncle Charlie?

15:01.501 --> 15:02.767
-How are you?
-Good.

15:02.769 --> 15:05.503
-Hey, Mick, can I get
a bitters and soda, please?

15:05.505 --> 15:06.804
Are you using
that move I showed you?

15:06.806 --> 15:08.873
For when they try
and keep you off the boards?

15:08.875 --> 15:11.776
You'll get two put backs a game,
at least, with this.

15:11.778 --> 15:14.312
That punk last week
sealed you every time.

15:14.314 --> 15:17.215
You hook him under here,
you spin him around.

15:17.217 --> 15:18.449
-You know that's a foul,
right?

15:18.451 --> 15:19.784
-Not if nobody sees it.

15:19.786 --> 15:21.586
Everyone's looking up here
at the ball.

15:21.588 --> 15:24.756
You go down there, you grab his
knee, you take all his power.

15:24.758 --> 15:26.424
It worked in my time.
-Yeah.

15:26.426 --> 15:27.926
Let me guess,
you also used to walk

15:27.928 --> 15:29.460
to school barefoot in the snow?

15:29.462 --> 15:32.130
Was that you too?
-No. That was your father.

15:32.132 --> 15:34.032
By the time I came around,
they invented shoes.

15:34.034 --> 15:35.600
-Hey, Micky..

15:39.605 --> 15:41.806
-I need to ask you for a
credit card or something, Leo.

15:41.808 --> 15:43.541
They're makin'
everybody settle up.

15:45.077 --> 15:47.545
You're kidding, right?
-I got a card, Lee. Here.

15:47.547 --> 15:49.180
-Hey, put that away, Charlie.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.383
-You want me to settle up?

15:53.018 --> 15:54.552
-It's high.

15:56.755 --> 16:00.291
-Okay. Double or nothin'.

16:00.293 --> 16:04.329
Yeah, yeah. Hey, Bobby,
the Knicks are gonna come out
of this timeout.

16:04.331 --> 16:07.799
Melo's gonna hit a three from
the top of the key, promise.

16:07.801 --> 16:09.267
What do you say?

16:13.172 --> 16:14.739
-Go ahead.

16:14.741 --> 16:16.107
-Alright.

16:17.009 --> 16:18.076
-It's a grand.

16:18.078 --> 16:19.844
-Yeah, I know.

16:19.846 --> 16:21.846
-Grand, shmand.
-Dad, are you sure?

16:21.848 --> 16:23.848
-Yeah, yeah,
they run this all the time.

16:25.684 --> 16:27.051
-<i> The magic here</i>
<i> at the garden.</i>

16:27.053 --> 16:29.921
<i> The celtics are</i>
<i> a matinee affair next Sunday</i>

16:29.923 --> 16:32.056
<i> but right now, the Knicks</i>
<i> just thinking about tonight.</i>

16:32.058 --> 16:33.658
<i> The Knicks are in a heap</i>
<i> of trouble right now.</i>

16:36.195 --> 16:38.096
<i> Pelicans have a foul to give.</i>

16:38.098 --> 16:40.298
<i> Knicks have two</i>
<i> timeouts remaining.</i>

16:41.867 --> 16:43.067
-Get it to melo.
Get it to melo.

16:43.069 --> 16:44.235
-<i> Knicks have no hot hands.</i>

16:44.237 --> 16:46.070
<i> No one is hot right now.</i>

16:46.072 --> 16:47.071
<i> Melo's been taken out..</i>

16:47.073 --> 16:49.674
-See?
-Shoot that. Shoot that!

16:51.076 --> 16:53.011
-<i> Anthony puts it up.</i>

16:56.849 --> 16:58.383
-I'm a free man!

16:58.385 --> 17:02.020
-Lucky fucking Lee.
-That's right.

17:02.022 --> 17:04.454
Never doubt it, Mick.
You never doubt it.

17:04.457 --> 17:08.459
Now give my boy a steak,
and put it on my tab.

17:08.461 --> 17:11.095
Anything you want.

17:11.097 --> 17:14.799
-Hey, ant, what do you say,
rangers or capitals?

17:14.800 --> 17:16.467
-I don't know hockey,
but, uh..

17:18.569 --> 17:20.471
I say rangers
'cause they're from New York.

17:20.473 --> 17:21.606
-That's what
i keep telling him.

17:21.608 --> 17:23.473
-Yeah?
-Stay put.

18:11.557 --> 18:12.824
-There we go.

18:12.826 --> 18:15.793
-Jesus fucking Christ.
-I got you.

18:15.795 --> 18:16.928
-I got him, I got him,
i got him.

18:16.930 --> 18:18.863
I'm gonna take him to bed.

18:18.865 --> 18:20.164
He's fine, he's fine.
-Alright.

18:20.166 --> 18:22.433
-Goodnight.

18:25.804 --> 18:28.206
-You got him?
-Yeah, no, he's -- he's fine.

18:31.009 --> 18:33.077
-That's a phenomenal kid
you got.

18:33.079 --> 18:34.378
-You're tellin' me.

18:34.380 --> 18:36.948
-Let's go. There you go.

18:39.618 --> 18:42.286
-You're a genius, kid.

18:42.288 --> 18:44.989
-<i> Hey, how's grace?</i>

18:44.991 --> 18:46.958
-<i> History.</i>

18:46.960 --> 18:48.659
-<i> Charlie. That was, what?</i>
<i> Like, a month?</i>

18:48.661 --> 18:50.061
-Well, something was missin'.

18:50.063 --> 18:53.898
And plus she smoked one of those
Bluetooth cigarette things.

18:53.900 --> 18:54.999
-Picky.

18:57.603 --> 18:59.504
-Okay, I'm gonna get
out of here.

18:59.506 --> 19:01.873
-Thanks, uncle Charlie.
-Alright.

19:01.875 --> 19:02.940
-See you later.
-Okay.

19:02.942 --> 19:04.976
-Hey, thanks
for getting him home.

19:04.978 --> 19:06.911
-You're welcome.

19:09.348 --> 19:11.149
-Alright, honey,
I'm gonna go check on him.

19:11.151 --> 19:12.617
-Okay.
-There's Indian in the fridge.

19:12.619 --> 19:14.218
-Okay, thank you.
-Alright.

19:18.824 --> 19:20.825
-<i> There's an alien</i>
<i> in the fridge?</i>

19:22.295 --> 19:24.462
-Indian.

19:24.464 --> 19:25.863
-Let me help you with that.

Come here.

19:30.170 --> 19:32.103
Alright. This one first.

Okay.

-That nigga be on my shit.

19:54.794 --> 19:56.260
His tighty whities might be
too tight or something.

19:56.262 --> 19:58.129
You know what I'm talking about!
Mr. vahena!

19:58.131 --> 19:59.130
Well, he'll be like,

19:59.132 --> 20:00.298
Look, look, look.

20:02.234 --> 20:03.701
-<i> What?</i>

20:05.304 --> 20:07.972
-Um, sir,
i must ask you please

20:07.974 --> 20:10.808
the declension
of the word deus.

20:10.810 --> 20:13.511
<i> This is something that should</i>
<i> be second nature to you,</i>
<i> Mr. hakim.</i>

20:13.513 --> 20:16.047
<i> Something that should be</i>
<i> in your bloodstream by now</i>

20:16.049 --> 20:18.583
<i> like part of your testicles.</i>

20:18.585 --> 20:20.685
-He hates you.

20:20.687 --> 20:23.321
<i> I'm trying to tell you all</i>
<i> 'cause I do all my work, okay?</i>

<i> You know I like water.</i>

<i> You know what I'm saying?</i>
<i> See, I don't --</i>

20:45.745 --> 20:48.212
-You know what they gonna do
gonna take like two minutes.

20:48.214 --> 20:49.680
Tops.

20:49.682 --> 20:51.882
Hey, you know
you got a quick release, boy!

20:53.653 --> 20:56.153
-Okay. I've been working on
this beat for a little bit.

20:56.155 --> 20:57.888
Alright?

21:12.404 --> 21:14.171
-What the fuck you gonna do,
huh?

21:14.173 --> 21:16.007
Huh? What the fuck you gonna do?

21:34.593 --> 21:35.860
-Yeah, I know you knew.

21:35.862 --> 21:38.996
-What about if I got,
like, a faberge egg?

21:40.599 --> 21:42.400
Wouldn't that be amazing?

21:42.402 --> 21:44.135
-Hey. Hey, honey.

21:44.770 --> 21:46.370
-Oh, Saint!

21:46.372 --> 21:47.571
How was practice, man?

21:47.573 --> 21:49.240
-It's fine.
What's goin' on?

21:49.242 --> 21:52.376
-Oh, we're just having
a little celebration.
-<i> Oh, we're, uh..</i>

21:52.378 --> 21:55.413
-About what?
-About your mom bein' wrong.

21:55.415 --> 21:57.214
-Oh, shut up.

21:57.216 --> 21:59.483
Your father had a little luck.

21:59.485 --> 22:01.052
-We all had a little luck.

22:01.054 --> 22:03.721
-And that does not mean
that I'm condoning betting.

22:03.723 --> 22:05.022
-Oh, no,
you'd never condone it.

22:05.024 --> 22:06.157
You wouldn't take a risk.

22:06.159 --> 22:08.526
-Oh, I married you, didn't I?
-Oh, good one.

22:08.528 --> 22:09.860
-I knew you'd like that one.

22:09.862 --> 22:12.163
-Alright. I'm gonna,
I'm gonna take a shower.

22:12.165 --> 22:13.964
-Wait, wait, wait. Hey.

22:15.100 --> 22:18.202
Come on.
Don't you wanna know?

22:18.204 --> 22:20.404
Aren't you curious
how much we won?

22:20.406 --> 22:22.640
You're the one that picked
the rangers in the first place.

22:23.241 --> 22:24.809
-Sure.

22:29.181 --> 22:30.781
-Ten grand.

22:32.017 --> 22:33.551
-Holy..
-Holy's right.

22:33.553 --> 22:35.086
-That's a -- that's a lot.

22:37.255 --> 22:39.990
What if you lost?
-Eh!

22:39.992 --> 22:41.125
"What if you lost?"

22:41.127 --> 22:42.893
You're definitely
your mother's son.

22:42.895 --> 22:44.428
What if we lost it?

22:46.865 --> 22:48.366
-Aah.

22:50.837 --> 22:53.304
-Congratulations.
-You too.

22:53.306 --> 22:54.972
I would've picked the capitals.

22:56.575 --> 22:58.242
What do I know?

22:58.244 --> 23:00.311
-I'm gonna take a shower.

23:00.313 --> 23:02.313
-Okay, yeah. Clean up.

23:03.882 --> 23:05.516
Get ready for the, uh..

23:07.619 --> 23:10.488
The celebratory dinner.

23:10.490 --> 23:13.257
We're gonna, we're gonna
pull out the, the, the..
-Alright, alright, alright.

23:13.259 --> 23:14.458
-The chinet.

23:25.938 --> 23:27.838
-Yeah,
I'll be out in a minute.

23:27.840 --> 23:30.241
-<i> Hey.</i>
-Jesus, mom.

23:30.243 --> 23:32.143
I'm naked in here.
-Sorry.

23:32.145 --> 23:33.677
I can't see anything.

23:40.051 --> 23:42.386
Everything good?
-Everything is great.

23:42.388 --> 23:44.121
Everything's great.

23:44.123 --> 23:46.090
-Here. Let me do that for you.
-I got it.

23:46.092 --> 23:47.425
-Yeah, no, I'm..

23:48.293 --> 23:50.161
Thank you. I am your mother.

23:54.199 --> 23:55.766
I know about the tuition.

23:59.538 --> 24:01.639
Anyway, I'll make sure
it's all taken care of.

24:02.741 --> 24:04.241
-Sounds great.

24:07.412 --> 24:09.113
-You remember our dark dates?

24:12.384 --> 24:13.417
-No, I don't.

24:13.419 --> 24:15.419
-You'd climb into the bed

24:15.421 --> 24:17.922
and we'd watch TV
until your father came home.

24:18.423 --> 24:20.624
All cozied up.

24:20.626 --> 24:22.827
You'd hang on me
like a little monkey.

24:25.664 --> 24:26.897
-Yeah.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.534
-And now you're gonna leave.

24:36.575 --> 24:39.543
Get some sleep.
Big game tomorrow.

24:57.230 --> 24:58.496
-Yo, yo, you see them?

24:58.498 --> 25:00.097
-No.
-Look, look, look.

25:00.099 --> 25:01.966
Turns out they're not my real
cousins, so that's good.

25:01.968 --> 25:03.200
-That's great, man.

25:09.174 --> 25:11.008
-Hey, honey.

25:12.945 --> 25:14.311
-Nice.

25:15.914 --> 25:18.048
Hey, darlin', how you doin'?
There you go.

25:25.424 --> 25:28.459
-Yo, yo, yo,
your team is right here.

25:28.461 --> 25:30.227
-Coach.
Glad you could make it.

25:30.229 --> 25:31.662
-Ray.
How are the boys playing?

25:31.664 --> 25:34.198
-Oh, uh, good.
Focused and ready to go.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.733
-No repeat of last year's
play-off?

25:35.735 --> 25:37.935
-No, no. I think that
experience hurt enough.

25:37.937 --> 25:39.069
<i> They don't want a repeat.</i>

25:39.071 --> 25:40.504
-Lookin' at the positives.
-Yes, sir.

25:40.506 --> 25:42.606
Hey, I was hopin'
i could take you out

25:42.608 --> 25:43.841
for a beer after the game.

25:43.843 --> 25:45.976
Maybe talk about that assistant
coaching vacancy.

25:45.978 --> 25:48.546
That's kind of you, coach, but
i-i gotta get back to school.

25:48.548 --> 25:49.580
-Oh, alright.

25:49.582 --> 25:51.015
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

25:52.417 --> 25:54.051
-Do your thing out there.

25:54.053 --> 25:55.486
We'll talk more
when you come up next week.

25:55.488 --> 25:57.421
-Alright, coach.

26:06.265 --> 26:08.999
-Anthony, do you want me
to hold that for you?

26:09.001 --> 26:10.801
-No, that's okay.
Thank you though.

26:10.803 --> 26:14.838
-<i> Students and parents,</i>
<i> welcome to New York City</i>
<i> high school</i>

26:14.840 --> 26:17.074
<i> d-1 quarter finals match-up.</i>

26:17.076 --> 26:19.343
<i> Between the riverside deacons</i>

26:19.345 --> 26:22.680
<i> and your Saint Anthony wolves.</i>

26:22.682 --> 26:24.815
-Whatever.
She's a total bitch.

26:24.817 --> 26:26.216
-What are we?
-Wolves!

26:26.218 --> 26:27.217
-Who are we?
-Wolves!

26:27.219 --> 26:28.385
-What are we?
-Wolves!

26:28.387 --> 26:29.853
-Let me hear you howl!

26:46.538 --> 26:48.305
-Alright, here we go!

26:56.715 --> 26:58.215
-He got stuck in class.

26:58.217 --> 27:00.851
And he wants to go
collect on the win.

27:00.853 --> 27:03.053
-Couldn't you do that
so he could see Anthony play?

27:03.055 --> 27:04.655
-Me?

27:04.657 --> 27:06.190
Can you imagine me
teachin' English?

27:07.359 --> 27:10.494
-<i> Keep movin', guys.</i>
<i> Keep movin'.</i>

27:12.797 --> 27:14.164
-Here we go!
-Let's go!

27:14.166 --> 27:15.733
-You know I can't tell him
what to do, Jen.

27:15.735 --> 27:18.435
I'm just tellin' you
what he told me.

27:18.437 --> 27:19.637
-Alright, as long as
we shut down seven

27:19.639 --> 27:20.704
we're in good shape.

27:20.706 --> 27:22.339
-Scouts here?
-Yeah, end of the row.

27:22.341 --> 27:24.008
Red shirts.

27:26.211 --> 27:28.746
- <i> Go swing it, swing it.</i>
<i>- Right there, right there.</i>

27:28.748 --> 27:30.547
-<i> Up top! Saint!</i>

27:30.549 --> 27:32.016
-Yes!
-That's it. Come on.

27:34.620 --> 27:38.455
-Saint! Saint! Saint! Saint!
Saint! Saint! Saint! Saint!

27:38.457 --> 27:42.026

27:42.028 --> 27:44.194
<i> Saint! Saint! Saint! Saint!</i>

27:49.200 --> 27:50.801
-<i> Professor.</i>

27:55.740 --> 27:58.909
-Hey, there. I, I was just
coming to see you actually.

27:59.444 --> 28:00.878
-Perfect.

28:04.716 --> 28:06.216
-Hey.

28:16.394 --> 28:18.328
-You know what, fellas?
We should head outside.

28:18.330 --> 28:20.631
I think security's coming by
to lock up any minute.

28:20.633 --> 28:22.599
-I heard you won
on the rangers last night.

28:22.601 --> 28:23.667
-<i> I did, yeah.</i>

28:25.003 --> 28:26.170
I sure did.

28:26.172 --> 28:29.073
And, uh, part of my plan
was to pay off a piece.

28:29.075 --> 28:30.674
-What a plan.

28:30.676 --> 28:33.477
But I thought I was takin' ten
against what you owed me.

28:39.951 --> 28:42.319
-Obviously, I fucked up.

28:43.755 --> 28:47.257
I, uh, I didn't realize that
you guys knew each other.

28:47.259 --> 28:49.526
It can't be the first time
this has happened, right?

28:54.866 --> 28:57.668
I'll make good for you,
both of you.

28:57.670 --> 28:59.937
Period.
-<i> Period.</i>

28:59.939 --> 29:02.339
-This is, is like
a grammar lesson.

29:03.041 --> 29:05.042
-And what about len?

29:05.044 --> 29:07.444
<i> How does he get paid?</i>

29:07.446 --> 29:10.314
<i> You didn't think we knew</i>
<i> about that, did you?</i>

29:10.316 --> 29:12.449
<i> Turns out you like to spread</i>
<i> the wealth around.</i>

29:17.655 --> 29:19.890
-Look, I teach at a college,
okay?

29:19.892 --> 29:21.959
This is not even
a good fucking college

29:21.961 --> 29:25.562
and, but I do have some
resources and, uh..

29:28.633 --> 29:31.135
I can come up
with everybody's everything.

29:31.137 --> 29:33.203
What I would like to do,
if you'd allow me

29:33.205 --> 29:35.639
is to put the ten
i won on Michigan state.

29:40.211 --> 29:41.812
-No.

29:47.619 --> 29:49.186
-I understand. Of course.

29:51.623 --> 29:52.790
Why would you?

29:52.792 --> 29:55.058
If you'll excuse me,
i have a game.

29:55.060 --> 29:57.027
My -- my -- my son has a game.

29:58.229 --> 29:59.930
I got a game to catch. Heh.

30:11.075 --> 30:12.643
-<i> Good job, ant! Let's go!</i>

30:13.378 --> 30:15.012
Good d!

30:19.084 --> 30:20.551
-Yes!

30:22.987 --> 30:24.822
-Timeout, gray. Both sides in.

30:24.824 --> 30:27.357
-Alright, alright!
That's what I'm talking about!

30:27.359 --> 30:30.427
-Let's go, baby.
-Alright, keep the pressure
on. Don't let up.

30:30.429 --> 30:32.896
And, Anthony,
you keep lookin' for your shot.

30:33.965 --> 30:35.966
-Coach, you gonna put
any subs in?

30:35.968 --> 30:37.167
-What?

30:37.169 --> 30:38.969
-They should get
some play-off time.

30:40.471 --> 30:43.273
What -- what about Gil? We've
been working after practice.

30:43.275 --> 30:45.375
I know he can bring the ball up
against these guys, no problem.

30:55.086 --> 30:56.987
-Gil, you're going in
for Dunn.

30:56.989 --> 31:00.390
Okay? Alright, let's go.

31:00.392 --> 31:04.361
-<i> Let's go!</i>
-Hey. You are personally
responsible for him.

31:05.730 --> 31:07.231
-Alright, coach.

31:09.601 --> 31:11.401
I'm looking for you, okay?

31:12.103 --> 31:14.538
-<i> ...sub for defense.</i>

31:14.540 --> 31:17.174
Sub for d
-ball, the ball, the ball.

31:19.177 --> 31:20.711
-Aah!

31:22.080 --> 31:25.148
-Go get the ball, wong!
Go get the ball!

31:25.150 --> 31:28.185
-Cobra. Cobra, pass him.

31:28.187 --> 31:31.488
<i> Deny 15! Deny 15!</i>

31:31.490 --> 31:33.657
-<i> Get it in, get it in,</i>
<i> get it in, get it in!</i>

31:33.659 --> 31:35.259
<i> No!</i>

31:40.131 --> 31:42.232
-Hakim, take the ball!

31:42.234 --> 31:45.068
-Gimme, gimme, gimme.
Run, run, run all the way!

31:45.070 --> 31:46.970
-What is this guy doin'?

31:46.972 --> 31:48.939
-Give the ball to Anthony.

31:48.941 --> 31:51.041
-Hakim! Hakim!

31:51.776 --> 31:52.943
-Ball!

31:52.945 --> 31:54.611
-<i> Come on, get it in!</i>

31:55.546 --> 31:57.381
<i> No!</i>

31:58.417 --> 32:00.417
-<i> Foul, 14 gray.</i>

32:00.419 --> 32:04.621
-Fuck! Timeout! Sit down!
-Come on. Come on.

32:04.623 --> 32:06.623
-I don't know what the fuck
is in you kids' heads.

32:06.625 --> 32:07.858
But get your shit together!

32:07.860 --> 32:08.892
-<i> That's your last timeout,</i>
<i> coach.</i>

32:08.894 --> 32:10.327
-Goddamnit!

32:10.329 --> 32:14.031
We are not losing this game!
Do you hear me?

32:14.033 --> 32:16.333
Dunn, go in for Gil.

32:16.335 --> 32:20.604
Now when Anthony makes
the second free throw

32:20.606 --> 32:22.105
<i> we go man.</i>

32:24.642 --> 32:27.344
What, am I speaking Polish?

32:27.346 --> 32:28.545
-I need one on the line,
coach.

32:28.547 --> 32:30.280
One's the shooter.

32:35.054 --> 32:37.454
-Shit.

32:37.456 --> 32:39.389
-<i> Alright, here we go.</i>
-Alright!

32:43.061 --> 32:44.528
-One and one.
On the release.

32:46.965 --> 32:48.432
-You've got it, Gil.

32:52.170 --> 32:54.004
<i> Here we go.</i>
<i>- Come on, Gil.</i>

33:04.950 --> 33:06.984
-Okay, no threes!

33:06.986 --> 33:08.585
No threes!

33:10.555 --> 33:13.924
-Switch.
-No switch, Gil! No switch!

33:13.926 --> 33:16.326
-Oh, come on.

33:21.032 --> 33:22.466
-No!

33:22.468 --> 33:23.800
-No, no, no.

33:29.540 --> 33:30.540
-Okay!
-Push it!

33:30.542 --> 33:32.209
Let's go, let's go!

33:37.148 --> 33:39.516
-Go, go! Shoot it!
-Shoot it! Shoot it!

33:39.518 --> 33:41.151
-<i> Shoot it!</i>

33:43.054 --> 33:45.055
-No!

33:53.931 --> 33:55.432
-Oh, my god!

34:00.671 --> 34:02.372
-He's gotta shoot that.

34:07.879 --> 34:09.346
-Okay, I gotta get back
to work.

34:11.549 --> 34:15.252
Just tell him, tell him
I'm proud of him, alright?

34:15.254 --> 34:19.589
-Gil! Gil! Gil! Gil! Gil! Gil!
Gil! Gil! Gil! Gil! Gil!

34:21.260 --> 34:22.391
-Yo, hey!

34:22.393 --> 34:23.627
You saw what I did to him
though, right?

34:23.629 --> 34:25.996
I went all Jeremy lin
on his ass!

34:27.099 --> 34:28.565
-Hey, now
you'll definitely be able

34:28.567 --> 34:30.132
to hook up
with your cousins.

34:35.672 --> 34:38.141
-You guys think
this is fucking funny?

34:40.978 --> 34:43.380
This is our season
on the line here!

35:06.137 --> 35:07.737
-Coach.

35:11.242 --> 35:12.943
-This is my job.

35:13.811 --> 35:15.579
Okay, I'm not in high school.

35:15.581 --> 35:17.280
This isn't a joke to me.

35:17.282 --> 35:19.282
<i> Cardinal Hayes won their game</i>

35:19.284 --> 35:22.519
<i> and as expected Washington</i>
<i> put a beat down on iona.</i>

35:22.521 --> 35:24.354
We have a bye this week.

35:24.356 --> 35:25.822
We need this.

35:25.824 --> 35:27.324
Both of us.

35:34.298 --> 35:36.566
-How many did jimenez have
for Washington?

35:37.034 --> 35:38.568
-Thirty-eight.

35:38.570 --> 35:41.037
-<i> Yeah, but that's</i>
<i> not our problem right now.</i>

35:41.039 --> 35:44.741
-Hey, we wait for the winner
of St. Stevens and Regis.

35:44.743 --> 35:48.545
Both of whom
we beat this season.

35:48.547 --> 35:52.482
But, guys, jimenez isn't
the only star in this league.

35:55.286 --> 35:58.121
Not everyone has a Gilbert wong
on their team.

35:59.424 --> 36:02.225
<i> Wong, you are a menace.</i>

36:03.394 --> 36:05.162
But I love you
for makin' that shot.

36:09.500 --> 36:11.168
-I love you too, coach!

36:11.170 --> 36:14.070
-Hey, y'all.
Semi-finals, what's up, man?

36:17.075 --> 36:21.811
-Gil! Gil! Gil! Gil! Gil! Gil!
Gil! Gil! Gil! Gil! Gil!

36:22.313 --> 36:23.980
-Yeah!

36:37.261 --> 36:39.095
-<i> Little league Lee.</i>

36:39.097 --> 36:40.630
<i> Get in.</i>

36:44.635 --> 36:45.902
-Hey.

36:51.943 --> 36:53.443
-Long time no talk.

36:53.445 --> 36:56.379
-Yeah. Life, you know,
it kind of takes over.

36:58.449 --> 37:00.550
-This kid could pitch.

37:00.552 --> 37:03.086
<i> He was throwing a curve ball</i>
<i> before anybody could.</i>

37:03.088 --> 37:06.223
I felt like a fucking cartoon
swinging at that thing.

37:08.460 --> 37:10.694
Only kid
to throw a perfect game.

37:12.763 --> 37:14.864
Or almost.

37:14.866 --> 37:18.034
Only no one was comin' close
to hittin' his stuff.

37:18.036 --> 37:19.669
<i> One batter left.</i>

37:19.671 --> 37:22.072
<i> His father shows up.</i>

37:22.074 --> 37:25.208
He throws a meatball
right down the middle.

37:25.210 --> 37:27.277
Kid crushes it dead center.

37:28.179 --> 37:30.480
Wow. Huh.

37:31.215 --> 37:32.849
-Yeah, so I, uh, I --

37:32.851 --> 37:36.886
-oh, hey.
Read about your kid. Wow.

37:36.888 --> 37:39.322
-Wait, this is
Saint Anthony's father?

37:39.324 --> 37:40.857
-Yeah.

37:40.859 --> 37:43.360
-<i> Hey, there's a name</i>
<i> for that. A Saint's father.</i>

37:43.362 --> 37:44.494
-Yeah, god.

37:45.596 --> 37:47.097
-Saint, senior.

37:50.601 --> 37:53.536
-So, uh,
i had a little luck recently.

37:53.538 --> 37:55.672
I wanted to spread it around.

37:55.674 --> 37:57.707
-I thought
we were below your radar.

38:04.382 --> 38:06.016
I'm listening.

38:07.852 --> 38:10.687
-Michigan state's playin'
at home next weekend.

38:12.023 --> 38:13.023
There's no way
they're gonna lose

38:13.025 --> 38:14.824
to penn state in east Lansing.

38:18.996 --> 38:20.563
I'll give you five points.

38:22.099 --> 38:24.234
-How much you wanna put down?

38:24.236 --> 38:25.502
-Thirty.

38:25.504 --> 38:26.670
Could you handle that?

38:26.672 --> 38:28.305
-Could I handle that?

38:29.073 --> 38:30.674
Can you handle that?

38:32.411 --> 38:35.345
Sorry, I forgot
who I was talking to.

38:35.347 --> 38:36.780
This guy's got a famous kid.

38:36.782 --> 38:38.348
<i> He's writin'</i>
<i> the great American novel.</i>

38:38.350 --> 38:40.684
He's got a house
out in the Hamptons, right?

38:42.219 --> 38:43.586
-Well, we rent.

39:03.574 --> 39:06.743
-What did Cornell say
after the game?

39:06.745 --> 39:08.845
-Uh, they weren't there.

39:08.847 --> 39:11.081
So I guess I'll know
when I go up for my visit.

39:21.058 --> 39:22.292
-Mm..

39:24.261 --> 39:26.062
Isn't there a rule

39:26.064 --> 39:30.100
about not doing this
during the week of a big game?

39:30.102 --> 39:31.935
-You are so confused.

39:31.937 --> 39:35.238
You're actually supposed to do
this the week of the big game.

39:35.240 --> 39:36.673
-Uh, are you sure?

39:36.675 --> 39:38.842
-Mm-hmm. I'm trying to win
on and off the court.

39:45.950 --> 39:47.650
-Well, I know

39:47.652 --> 39:49.853
that there's a rule
about doing this

39:49.855 --> 39:52.422
when your parents
are in the other room.

39:54.859 --> 39:56.593
-It's a good thing
there's no one home.

40:04.935 --> 40:07.203
-Anthony, Anthony..

40:09.740 --> 40:12.142
I can't do this with your
parents in the other room.

40:16.447 --> 40:18.515
-There's no one here.
I don't, what?

40:18.517 --> 40:20.450
-I heard the door.

40:22.587 --> 40:24.554
-Fine. I'll go check.
-What's wrong with you?

40:24.556 --> 40:26.055
-No, no, nothing. I'm just..

40:26.057 --> 40:28.224
You'd just better be ready
when I get back.

40:28.226 --> 40:29.959
-Well then, hurry up.

40:39.603 --> 40:42.172
-I couldn't make
your game yesterday.

40:46.710 --> 40:48.778
-That's okay.

40:48.780 --> 40:51.781
-Yeah, Charlie told me..

40:51.783 --> 40:54.017
...you passed the ball
to the chink..

40:55.186 --> 40:57.754
...instead of taking
the last shot yourself.

41:01.759 --> 41:05.562
That's kind of a questionable
decision. Don't you think?

41:09.934 --> 41:14.103
Well, you still managed
to get a lot of attention.

41:14.105 --> 41:15.605
Don't you?

41:30.621 --> 41:32.188
Silence?

41:35.493 --> 41:37.260
Well, that's a good reminder,
you know.

41:37.262 --> 41:38.795
When I write characters..

41:40.097 --> 41:43.199
...they always have
one defining characteristic

41:43.201 --> 41:44.834
and yours would be..

41:46.637 --> 41:48.204
...silence.

41:52.977 --> 41:55.111
-<i> Baby.</i>

41:55.113 --> 41:58.181
I have to go. My mom wants me
to watch my brother.

41:58.183 --> 42:00.250
-<i> Yeah.</i>
-Hey, Victoria.

42:02.119 --> 42:03.920
-Oh, hi, Mr. Keller.

42:05.155 --> 42:07.824
-How did my son get so lucky?

42:12.129 --> 42:15.031
-Well, I think I got
pretty lucky too, hmm.

42:16.066 --> 42:18.301
I should go. So..
-Yeah.

42:18.303 --> 42:19.502
-Um, it was nice seeing you,
Mr. Keller.

42:19.504 --> 42:21.237
-Let me walk you out.
-Okay.

42:27.245 --> 42:29.312
-Ahh.

42:30.381 --> 42:31.781
That's my boy.

43:16.894 --> 43:18.361
-Hey, you guys need one?

43:18.363 --> 43:19.896
Yo, you got next?

43:22.166 --> 43:24.634
You got five?
-<i> Yeah, we got our five, bro.</i>

43:24.636 --> 43:26.502
-<i> Leave, leave, leave,</i>
<i> leave, leave, leave!</i>

43:26.504 --> 43:29.772
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

43:29.774 --> 43:31.674
Yeah!

43:33.177 --> 43:36.145
Next. Next. Next.

43:36.147 --> 43:37.847
-Yo, soc, I was open
in the corner, man.

43:37.849 --> 43:39.649
-You can be open
all motherfucking day

43:39.651 --> 43:41.451
ain't nobody giving you
the ball, alright?

43:41.453 --> 43:44.153
Be happy you won this shit.
Be happy you won.

43:44.155 --> 43:45.521
-You gotta pass
the fucking ball.

43:45.523 --> 43:46.956
-Then get outta here
if you don't like it then

43:46.958 --> 43:49.626
you too wong foo motherfucker.

43:49.628 --> 43:51.494
-Fuck you!

43:51.496 --> 43:53.963
-Good. We need one.

43:53.965 --> 43:55.531
Winners need one.

43:55.533 --> 43:57.066
-Yo, if you ain't
got your five

43:57.068 --> 43:58.201
you gotta get off the court, b.

43:58.203 --> 43:59.969
-No, we got him.

43:59.971 --> 44:02.138
That's our white boy.

44:02.140 --> 44:05.074
You got one, now we got one.

44:05.076 --> 44:06.809
-Yo, Larry bird, you balling?

44:12.417 --> 44:14.484
-I have Cornell,
if you can't tell.

44:16.020 --> 44:17.320
Get the fuck outta here!

44:24.229 --> 44:25.828
-Yeah!

44:27.931 --> 44:29.499
-Hey, yo, ball!

44:31.235 --> 44:32.902
-Put it up! Put it up!

44:32.904 --> 44:36.305
What the fuck?
You missed a fucking layup, man.

44:38.443 --> 44:39.609
-<i> Basket!</i>

44:39.611 --> 44:40.677
-<i> Now we down.</i>

44:40.679 --> 44:42.545
-You above, Princess.

44:42.547 --> 44:44.414
We ain't got nothing for you.
-Yo, ball!

44:44.416 --> 44:46.015
Yo, yo, ball! Ball!

44:46.017 --> 44:47.350
-<i> You suck, that's why.</i>

44:47.352 --> 44:48.418
-Yo, ball!

44:48.420 --> 44:50.553
-You got no respect
in this park.

44:50.555 --> 44:53.489
-Come on! Yo, pass it!
What are you fucking doing, huh?

44:53.491 --> 44:55.425
-Check! Let's go, let's go!

44:55.427 --> 44:58.027
We got a baby! We got a baby!

45:01.666 --> 45:03.466
Where you going, boy?

45:03.468 --> 45:04.834
You got a long day
ahead of you, boy.

45:04.836 --> 45:06.169
-Yo, get the fuck back.

45:06.171 --> 45:07.470
I ain't here
to help you up, man.

45:07.472 --> 45:10.973
Play some motherfucking ball.
Stop being a pussy.

45:10.975 --> 45:13.276
-<i> I own you.</i>
<i> You hear me, Princess?</i>

45:13.278 --> 45:15.044
I own you, Princess.
-Let's go, ball!

45:15.046 --> 45:16.112
-Let's go. You ain't shit.

45:16.114 --> 45:17.246
You ain't going nowhere.

45:17.248 --> 45:19.415
You ain't going nowhere, boy!

45:19.417 --> 45:22.485
Oh, shit.
-Ball, ball, ball!

45:28.158 --> 45:30.760
-Motherfucker!

45:30.762 --> 45:32.829
You ain't shit now, boy!
-Fuck off!

45:32.831 --> 45:34.297
-Fuck this motherfucker,
he pushed me!

45:34.299 --> 45:35.364
-Oh, he pushed me?

45:35.366 --> 45:37.133
<i> You all up in his jock</i>
<i> all game</i>

45:37.135 --> 45:38.601
<i> talking about "he pushed me!"</i>

45:38.603 --> 45:39.802
He gave you one little push!

45:39.804 --> 45:41.137
-Let me go.
Let me go, I'm good.

45:41.139 --> 45:42.338
I swear to god, let me go.

45:42.340 --> 45:44.040
Let me go, let me go.
Come on, motherfucker!

45:44.042 --> 45:45.975
I'll kill you, piece of shit!

45:45.977 --> 45:48.277
Fuck your mother!
-Get outta here!

45:48.279 --> 45:50.346
- <i> Fuck you, soc!</i>
<i>- Keep walking, motherfucker.</i>

45:50.348 --> 45:51.514
-<i> Fuck this motherfucker.</i>

45:51.516 --> 45:53.049
<i> He ain't gonna</i>
<i> push me like that again.</i>

45:53.051 --> 45:54.917
-That's what happens when you
let motherfuckers from prison

45:54.919 --> 45:57.320
play fucking basketball.

46:06.396 --> 46:08.364
There's your change.
-Thank you.

46:09.967 --> 46:11.467
-You're hungry, right?

46:12.636 --> 46:15.438
That shit gets your
adrenaline going.

46:15.440 --> 46:18.407
My first one,
i couldn't even think.

46:18.409 --> 46:21.043
I was swinging like a crazy man.

46:21.045 --> 46:22.645
Broke my little pinky.

46:22.647 --> 46:24.080
Never healed.

46:25.649 --> 46:27.483
That shot you threw up
looked nice.

46:30.554 --> 46:31.988
White ray Allen.

46:34.958 --> 46:38.728
I bet you fit into someone's
system real good, hmm?

46:38.730 --> 46:43.399
Curling. Getting the pass.
Draining it.

46:43.401 --> 46:45.101
Always doing the right thing.

46:46.503 --> 46:49.472
Second option,
third option maybe.

46:54.745 --> 46:56.279
Oh.

47:01.919 --> 47:03.352
He don't like that.

47:03.354 --> 47:07.156
He wanna be
the first option, don't he?

47:07.158 --> 47:12.028
Cornell wanna be
the first option.

47:13.897 --> 47:16.465
You feel angry, Cornell?

47:16.467 --> 47:18.534
<i> You feel that</i>
<i> choking in your throat?</i>

47:19.636 --> 47:21.938
He said, "fuck you"
to your mama!

47:21.940 --> 47:23.573
You ain't like that, did you?

47:24.908 --> 47:27.176
Feel that anger.

47:27.178 --> 47:29.545
Rage. Right?

47:29.547 --> 47:31.247
Rage!

47:35.586 --> 47:38.287
Don't let it push you
like a leaf in the wind.

47:38.289 --> 47:41.257
Let it blow you like a sail.

47:41.259 --> 47:43.092
Take you where you wanna go.

47:51.768 --> 47:55.638
Consider yourself
schooled by socrates.

48:15.626 --> 48:17.293
-What's up?

48:26.336 --> 48:28.871
-I just wanted to tell you..

49:03.073 --> 49:04.206
-Hey.

49:05.476 --> 49:07.810
-Defense. Let's go! Get back!
Get back!

49:16.954 --> 49:18.688
-Freeze. Gimme that.

49:18.690 --> 49:19.956
We don't feed the post

49:19.958 --> 49:23.459
when the defense takes away
the baseline entry.

49:23.461 --> 49:25.261
It's up here for the high low.

49:25.263 --> 49:26.862
<i> Matt, reverse pivot seal.</i>

49:28.532 --> 49:29.932
<i> Cornell gets an easy one.</i>

49:29.934 --> 49:32.168
Thank you.
Let's keep running this.

49:32.170 --> 49:34.003
Anthony!

49:34.005 --> 49:36.305
-Coach.

49:36.307 --> 49:37.974
I didn't wanna interrupt.

49:37.976 --> 49:39.375
-Hi, I'm Chris Paulson.

49:39.377 --> 49:41.944
-Jenny Keller. I've seen you
at a couple of games.

49:41.946 --> 49:44.213
Thanks for all the support
you've given Anthony.

49:44.215 --> 49:46.349
-Well, he's a very
talented player.

49:46.351 --> 49:47.850
-The school is beautiful.

49:47.852 --> 49:49.819
We would be delighted
to have Anthony here.

49:49.821 --> 49:52.955
-Okay, mom.
-That's right.

49:52.957 --> 49:55.558
Uh, I have to pay a visit
to the financial aid office.

49:55.560 --> 49:57.426
-Oh, let me have someone
show you the way.

49:57.428 --> 49:58.961
Clancy!

49:58.963 --> 50:01.597
-No. You know, I'll, I'll,
i can find it.

50:01.599 --> 50:04.934
Thank you. Text me
when you're done, okay?

50:04.936 --> 50:07.136
-Come on, let me, uh,
show you around.

50:13.944 --> 50:17.246
-It's a beautiful gym.
-Thank you.

50:17.248 --> 50:18.748
-Have a seat, buddy.

50:22.886 --> 50:25.554
We coaches have a secret.

50:25.556 --> 50:27.156
We all want the great defenders

50:27.158 --> 50:30.593
the great passers,
great rebounders.

50:30.595 --> 50:35.731
But most of all,
we want a great scorer.

50:35.733 --> 50:38.367
<i> I mean, this jump shot</i>
<i> is super smooth.</i>

50:38.369 --> 50:40.636
<i> Quick release.</i>

50:40.638 --> 50:43.072
Watch this.

50:43.074 --> 50:45.174
You follow your shot.

50:45.176 --> 50:47.343
<i> Players just don't</i>
<i> do that anymore.</i>

50:47.345 --> 50:50.079
<i> Everyone on this level</i>
<i> can put the ball in the hoop.</i>

50:50.081 --> 50:52.815
<i> It's who wants to the most</i>
<i> that makes the difference.</i>

50:52.817 --> 50:54.817
Do you want it, Anthony?

50:56.086 --> 50:57.553
-I do, coach.

50:59.923 --> 51:02.758
-I have my guys gather as much
information as they can.

51:04.661 --> 51:07.263
<i> I fight hard</i>
<i> for my scholarships.</i>

51:07.265 --> 51:09.298
I can't just
give them to anyone.

51:09.300 --> 51:11.067
<i> Here's last year's finals.</i>

51:11.069 --> 51:12.902
<i> Big guy bodying you</i>
<i> the whole game.</i>

51:12.904 --> 51:14.837
<i> Hard fouls.</i>

51:14.839 --> 51:16.739
You could take it right at him.

51:16.741 --> 51:19.241
Get him out of the game,
get yourself to the line

51:19.243 --> 51:20.676
where you've made,
how many in a row?

51:22.646 --> 51:24.847
-Forty-two.

51:24.849 --> 51:26.248
-Pretty amazing number.

51:26.250 --> 51:30.753
<i> But you wanna avoid</i>
<i> the contact, so, you pass.</i>

51:30.755 --> 51:33.722
<i> Instead of getting big</i>
<i> in the big moment,</i>
<i> you get small.</i>

51:35.625 --> 51:37.893
And getting small leads to this.

51:48.905 --> 51:51.140
There's no doubt that
you have the talent, Anthony.

51:53.577 --> 51:56.078
And you're a very good student.

51:56.080 --> 51:58.514
You seem like you'd fit in well
here.

51:58.516 --> 52:01.550
But I'm not looking
for someone who will fit in.

52:01.552 --> 52:03.586
I'm looking for someone
who will stand out.

52:07.491 --> 52:08.891
<i> Show us you can do that, son.</i>

52:10.660 --> 52:12.294
<i> We're rooting for you.</i>

52:12.296 --> 52:13.863
-Thank you, coach.

52:24.141 --> 52:27.476
-What did Mr. hill say
about the financial aid?

52:27.478 --> 52:30.846
-Well, uh, we don't qualify
for as much as I was hoping for

52:30.848 --> 52:31.947
because we've had
a lot of money

52:31.949 --> 52:33.716
in and out of our accounts
over the years.

52:35.218 --> 52:37.052
-What does it matter? If we
need it, we need it, right?

52:39.656 --> 52:42.024
-There are a lot of people
who need it, sweetheart.

52:43.460 --> 52:46.662
But I've socked some away,
and I can't imagine them

52:46.664 --> 52:48.797
not offering you a scholarship
with how much they love you.

52:50.867 --> 52:52.568
-They're not sure.

52:57.974 --> 53:00.176
-Hey.

53:00.178 --> 53:01.777
I don't want you to worry.

53:03.280 --> 53:05.681
<i> It's all gonna work out</i>
<i> for the best.</i>

53:05.683 --> 53:07.082
<i> Really.</i>

53:08.185 --> 53:10.052
-You always think that.

53:10.054 --> 53:12.521
-Yes.

53:12.523 --> 53:14.823
What's the alternative?

53:14.825 --> 53:16.525
-Maybe looking at the truth.

53:22.933 --> 53:24.633
-Okay.

53:32.742 --> 53:34.743
I know this is a stressful time.

53:36.479 --> 53:37.980
-Victoria's pregnant.

53:46.289 --> 53:47.890
-<i> Jesus.</i>

53:48.992 --> 53:51.293
How is that possible?

53:51.295 --> 53:52.795
-It was stupid, alright?

53:52.797 --> 53:55.698
-No, it's not alright.

53:55.700 --> 53:57.233
This is not a game.

53:57.235 --> 53:59.568
You don't just ice your knees,
"oh, too bad we lost"

53:59.570 --> 54:01.003
and get ready for the next one!

54:03.940 --> 54:06.208
-So, getting pregnant
is like losing, mom?

54:09.779 --> 54:11.680
-It is real, Anthony.

54:11.682 --> 54:13.716
With real ramifications.

54:17.988 --> 54:20.122
<i> Do her parents know?</i>

54:20.124 --> 54:21.724
-No.

54:26.129 --> 54:28.397
Don't tell dad.

54:28.399 --> 54:29.798
<i> Please?</i>

54:34.671 --> 54:36.905
-I'll go with you.

54:36.907 --> 54:38.474
And we'll pay.

54:57.460 --> 54:59.595
-<i> Every possession</i>
<i> is critical now.</i>

55:10.007 --> 55:11.573
-Make sure that gentleman's
taken care of.

55:33.029 --> 55:36.865
-<i> ...up to cornley.</i>
<i> Missed the layup!</i>

55:36.867 --> 55:41.603
<i> Here comes Lucas.</i>
<i> 68-65, Michigan state.</i>

56:02.593 --> 56:05.527
-<i> And penn state clinging</i>
<i> to a two-point lead</i>

56:05.529 --> 56:09.865
<i> but Andrew Jones can</i>
<i> put it away right here.</i>

56:09.867 --> 56:11.734
<i> That should do it!</i>

56:11.736 --> 56:13.836
<i> A four-point penn state lead.</i>

56:17.440 --> 56:20.542
<i> And another shocker</i>
<i> in east Lansing!</i>

56:20.544 --> 56:22.778
<i> And for the first time</i>
<i> in the history</i>

56:22.780 --> 56:24.913
<i> of penn state basketball</i>

56:24.915 --> 56:28.450
<i> they will fly out of here</i>
<i> with a smile on their face.</i>

56:31.654 --> 56:33.789
-Hey, you seen Keller?

56:33.791 --> 56:35.591
Keller. Lee Keller.

56:35.593 --> 56:36.692
Have you seen him today?

56:36.694 --> 56:38.360
-No, he hasn't been around.

56:46.236 --> 56:47.770
-Let's go.

57:15.198 --> 57:18.767
-Woo! That's pretty, Cornell!

57:18.769 --> 57:21.403
You should just throw
that down, though, man.

57:21.405 --> 57:22.671
When I could get up there,
i threw it down

57:22.673 --> 57:23.939
every chance I could.

57:23.941 --> 57:25.340
Hard.

57:25.342 --> 57:27.876
So, a brother would know it.

57:27.878 --> 57:29.678
Maybe you can't even
dunk it though.

57:29.680 --> 57:31.814
-Me?
Yeah, I can dunk it.

57:31.816 --> 57:33.115
-Oh.
-<i> Bet you never could though.</i>

57:33.117 --> 57:35.217
-Oh!

57:35.219 --> 57:38.020
It must be
white-boy-talk-trash-Tuesday.

57:38.022 --> 57:40.189
'Cause you got a mouth.

57:40.191 --> 57:42.424
Let me show
this motherfucker somethin'.

57:50.233 --> 57:52.901
-So, you're the one
they talk about, huh?

57:52.903 --> 57:55.838
Thelonious.

57:55.840 --> 57:57.739
Man, you must've been
able to jump.

57:57.741 --> 57:58.941
'Cause you're not that big.

57:58.943 --> 58:02.478
-Oh, ho-ho!
I didn't just dunk it.

58:02.480 --> 58:04.313
I dunked on motherfuckers.

58:06.116 --> 58:08.417
Come here, I'll show you
how I used to do it.

58:08.419 --> 58:11.119
-Alright.
-Alright, first,
i used to fake 'em up.

58:11.121 --> 58:12.988
-Yeah?
-Then take 'em down.

58:12.990 --> 58:14.857
But I went off my right foot.

58:17.528 --> 58:19.661
Use that left leg
to keep 'em off you.

58:19.663 --> 58:21.530
-That didn't look
like a dunk to me.

58:21.532 --> 58:23.398
-Call me in 30 years.

58:24.634 --> 58:26.268
Let's see you dunk it.

58:39.883 --> 58:40.983
-Yeah!

58:40.985 --> 58:44.987
-Oh, ho, ho! My man!

59:01.304 --> 59:02.704
-Hey.

59:27.830 --> 59:29.464
-Whoa.

59:30.833 --> 59:34.269
I, I didn't know you applied.

59:34.271 --> 59:36.238
-Yeah.

59:36.240 --> 59:39.975
Yeah, I, I didn't tell you, um..

59:39.977 --> 59:42.678
But I, I thought it'd be
a long shot anyway, so I..

59:43.980 --> 59:45.681
-Yeah.

59:45.683 --> 59:47.249
So, um..

59:49.352 --> 59:51.320
What's going on
with middlebury then?

59:52.555 --> 59:55.090
-Anthony, ucla
is a really good school.

59:56.359 --> 59:58.994
With my dad living out there,
tuition, it's nothing.

01:00:04.167 --> 01:00:05.834
-This is about what happened.

01:00:07.537 --> 01:00:10.973
I mean, you can't even stand
to be around me anymore.

01:00:10.975 --> 01:00:12.441
Right?

01:00:14.243 --> 01:00:16.078
-No, it's not about that,
and..

01:00:18.915 --> 01:00:20.983
This is, this is about me.

01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:28.724
Anthony.

01:00:31.361 --> 01:00:33.128
What am I supposed to do?

01:00:34.397 --> 01:00:35.931
You want me to wait
around for you

01:00:35.933 --> 01:00:38.367
until you feel like seeing me

01:00:38.369 --> 01:00:40.268
or until you feel like
talking to me?

01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:43.138
Until you feel like you can
share anything with me?

01:00:45.408 --> 01:00:47.175
-Go wherever
the fuck you want!

01:00:47.177 --> 01:00:48.744
Okay?

01:00:51.581 --> 01:00:53.548
Just don't talk to me anymore.

01:01:08.197 --> 01:01:09.297
-What happened?
-It's nothing.

01:01:09.299 --> 01:01:10.766
I just got it stuck
in a door at work.

01:01:10.768 --> 01:01:12.367
-Lee, just let me look at it.

01:01:12.369 --> 01:01:14.136
-No, it's wrapped up.
It's fine.

01:01:14.138 --> 01:01:16.204
Don't worry about it, okay?

01:01:16.206 --> 01:01:18.473
<i> Now,</i>
<i> I got something to tell you.</i>

01:01:18.475 --> 01:01:21.309
I'm leaving
that fucking college.

01:01:21.311 --> 01:01:22.644
If I'm gonna get
my book finished

01:01:22.646 --> 01:01:24.446
I gotta focus on
one thing at a time.

01:01:24.448 --> 01:01:26.581
And to be honest, I feel
completely disrespected

01:01:26.583 --> 01:01:28.617
<i> by those people,</i>
<i> so, that's that.</i>

01:01:30.053 --> 01:01:31.420
-How bad is it?

01:01:31.422 --> 01:01:33.955
-It's fine. It's wrapped.
-Not, not, not that.

01:01:35.458 --> 01:01:37.559
I know you drained
the college account.

01:01:38.628 --> 01:01:40.195
The bank called me.

01:01:41.297 --> 01:01:42.898
-Well, Jenny,
there was barely enough

01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:44.232
in there to pay
for one semester.

01:01:44.234 --> 01:01:46.501
I don't really see what the..

01:01:46.503 --> 01:01:48.370
-Do you know,
do you understand

01:01:48.372 --> 01:01:51.673
what I had to give up
to save that money?

01:01:51.675 --> 01:01:53.975
I wasn't supposed to be selling
men's clothing.

01:01:53.977 --> 01:01:55.610
I went to fucking Parsons!

01:01:55.612 --> 01:01:58.647
-<i> Okay. You quit.</i>

01:01:58.649 --> 01:02:01.550
You quit, I quit. We can
all be, you know, artists.

01:02:01.552 --> 01:02:03.418
Dreams come true, right?

01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:04.886
But you would
never fucking do that

01:02:04.888 --> 01:02:06.655
because you're
such a goddamn martyr.

01:02:06.657 --> 01:02:07.889
You and your fucking son.

01:02:07.891 --> 01:02:10.592
You're so fucking perfect.

01:02:10.594 --> 01:02:12.260
There's no room for me!

01:02:16.199 --> 01:02:17.599
-How much do you owe?

01:02:17.601 --> 01:02:19.901
-<i> None of your</i>
<i> goddamn business.</i>

01:02:19.903 --> 01:02:22.170
-Fuck you.
How much do you owe?

01:02:27.376 --> 01:02:29.111
-$200,000.

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:39.421
Look..

01:02:40.690 --> 01:02:42.157
-Um..

01:02:45.461 --> 01:02:47.262
We sell my parents' cabin.

01:02:47.264 --> 01:02:49.297
-Mnm-mnm.

01:02:49.299 --> 01:02:51.199
I know how important
it is to you.

01:02:51.201 --> 01:02:53.235
I wouldn't.
-We have no choice.

01:02:58.574 --> 01:03:00.108
-Well, I looked into it.

01:03:02.712 --> 01:03:04.346
-You looked into it?
-<i> Yeah.</i>

01:03:05.915 --> 01:03:08.950
<i> And you know,</i>
<i> if you're willing</i>
<i> to take out a mortgage</i>

01:03:10.386 --> 01:03:14.156
that would pretty much cover it,
okay?

01:03:16.459 --> 01:03:19.327
But I will make sure you do not
lose that house, Jenny.

01:03:20.797 --> 01:03:22.364
I promise.

01:03:26.068 --> 01:03:29.504
-I can't, I can't,
i can't even look at you.

01:03:29.506 --> 01:03:31.039
-Hey, come here.

01:04:02.438 --> 01:04:04.606
Oh, fuck!

01:04:59.596 --> 01:05:00.962
-What are we?
-Wolves!

01:05:00.964 --> 01:05:02.097
-Let me hear you howl!

01:05:30.693 --> 01:05:31.993
-<i> Hey.</i>

01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:36.331
When you didn't come out,
i thought maybe you were hurt.

01:05:41.671 --> 01:05:43.338
-I'm not hurt.

01:05:49.712 --> 01:05:53.782

-In the finals, coach.
-No, I'm not asking you, wong.

Anthony, where will we be?

-In the finals, coach.
-Right.

I'll catch you guys later.

01:09:18.488 --> 01:09:20.522
-<i> Alright, man.</i>

01:09:20.524 --> 01:09:22.122
-You stupid?

01:09:23.526 --> 01:09:25.160
-What?
-You know the score.

01:09:26.595 --> 01:09:29.663
I mean, you're winning. All you
gotta do is hold the ball.

01:09:29.666 --> 01:09:31.499
So why you shooting?

01:09:35.738 --> 01:09:38.006
You trying to lose, Cornell?

01:09:40.676 --> 01:09:44.212
You're a loser? Hmm?

01:09:44.214 --> 01:09:46.514
Hmm?
-Get off of me!

01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:54.154
You're the fucking loser.

01:09:55.992 --> 01:09:57.692
-That's right.

01:09:57.694 --> 01:09:59.561
I'm done.

01:09:59.563 --> 01:10:01.729
You ain't.

01:10:01.731 --> 01:10:04.232
-<i> Hey, ant! Let's go.</i>

01:10:11.106 --> 01:10:13.741
Your mom and dad
are already up at the cabin.

01:10:13.743 --> 01:10:16.177
And I get the privilege
of driving you.

01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:21.115
-Is my dad okay?

01:10:21.117 --> 01:10:22.817
-Isn't he always?

01:10:28.490 --> 01:10:31.693
You had an off day, kid.
You're allowed.

01:10:31.695 --> 01:10:34.028
Your mom used to tell me that
back in the day.

01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:40.435
-She saw you play?

01:10:40.437 --> 01:10:43.771
Almost every game. Lee too.

01:10:43.773 --> 01:10:45.206
That's how they met.

01:10:47.843 --> 01:10:49.110
-Wait.

01:10:49.112 --> 01:10:51.913
Wait. My mom knew you first?

01:10:53.515 --> 01:10:54.816
-Yeah.

01:10:55.951 --> 01:10:57.852
Knew me first.

01:11:00.522 --> 01:11:03.124
<i> It's funny</i>
<i> how things work out, huh?</i>

01:11:07.529 --> 01:11:09.497
I was..

01:11:12.668 --> 01:11:14.569
I was never good with women.

01:11:18.173 --> 01:11:20.108
Great jump shot though.

01:11:34.957 --> 01:11:36.724
-And how fast can this happen?

01:11:36.726 --> 01:11:38.359
-<i> As soon as the check</i>
<i> clears the account.</i>

01:11:38.361 --> 01:11:40.528
I'll make the payments.
Latest, Tuesday?

01:11:40.530 --> 01:11:41.663
-I want you to call them

01:11:41.665 --> 01:11:43.164
and -- and tell them
it's on its way.

01:11:43.166 --> 01:11:45.366
-You don't want unnecessary
contact with these guys.

01:11:45.368 --> 01:11:47.802
Our word doesn't exactly mean
much to them anyway.

01:11:47.804 --> 01:11:49.203
But I'll see them
as soon as I can.

01:11:49.205 --> 01:11:51.639
And make sure all the accounts
are closed, alright?

01:11:51.641 --> 01:11:54.208
-There's no need to officially
close any accounts.

01:11:54.210 --> 01:11:56.177
It's not like
a department store.

01:11:56.179 --> 01:11:58.880
-"It's not like
a department store?"

01:11:58.882 --> 01:12:00.548
Just make it very clear to them

01:12:00.550 --> 01:12:02.317
there is no open line
of credit here.

01:12:02.319 --> 01:12:06.321
-Well, Charlie,
just do whatever she says, okay?

01:12:11.026 --> 01:12:12.760
I'm going outside.

01:12:28.877 --> 01:12:30.278
<i> Hey.</i>

01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:32.347
Thought I could
rebound for you.

01:12:37.019 --> 01:12:38.519
-Sure, yeah.

01:12:41.924 --> 01:12:44.425
-So, uh, how many did you
get last night?

01:12:46.895 --> 01:12:47.962
-Twelve.

01:12:49.164 --> 01:12:51.099
-That's not a lot for you.

01:12:51.101 --> 01:12:52.800
-It's a season low.

01:12:52.802 --> 01:12:54.402
-Yeah.

01:12:54.404 --> 01:12:57.438
Charlie said
the game was kinda close.

01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:58.940
-We won by two.

01:13:02.945 --> 01:13:04.612
-How about a little
one-on-one?

01:13:05.948 --> 01:13:07.348
-What about your finger?

01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:10.651
Yeah, it'll make it fair, right?

01:13:10.653 --> 01:13:12.620
<i> Come on.</i>

01:13:12.622 --> 01:13:14.722
Show me your big moves.
-Yeah?

01:13:16.425 --> 01:13:18.593
-Give your old man
the ball first.

01:13:18.595 --> 01:13:20.461
-Yeah, you can have it.
You're gonna need it.

01:13:29.405 --> 01:13:31.038
-Woo!

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:34.375
One-nothing, good guys.

01:13:34.377 --> 01:13:35.543
-Here, if you hand me
that one, I can --

01:13:35.545 --> 01:13:37.044
-yeah.

01:13:40.249 --> 01:13:42.984
-Woo!
-There you go.

01:13:42.986 --> 01:13:45.086
-So what's going on
with Cornell?

01:13:46.155 --> 01:13:47.622
-I don't know.

01:13:47.624 --> 01:13:50.124
-What? They were begging for
you, and now they're not sure?

01:13:50.126 --> 01:13:51.692
-I guess they wanna see more.

01:13:51.694 --> 01:13:52.827
-Tell me about it. Me too.

01:13:52.829 --> 01:13:54.896
-Hey, we're rooting for you,
Saint!

01:13:55.932 --> 01:13:57.799
<i> Yeah!</i>

01:14:00.503 --> 01:14:02.737
-Yo, dad, I wasn't ready.

01:14:02.739 --> 01:14:06.507
-Yo, Saint. Three-nothing.

01:14:12.614 --> 01:14:13.648
<i> My ball.</i>

01:14:17.252 --> 01:14:18.386
Oh!

01:14:18.388 --> 01:14:22.457
Oh, are you gonna play
some real defense?

01:14:22.459 --> 01:14:24.725
Oh, okay.

01:14:24.727 --> 01:14:26.127
Okay.

01:14:32.501 --> 01:14:33.935
-That's one.
-<i> Uh-huh.</i>

01:14:33.937 --> 01:14:35.970
You're lucky I don't call fouls.

01:14:44.947 --> 01:14:46.647
<i> Come on, let's go.</i>

01:14:47.684 --> 01:14:48.883
Whoops!

01:14:55.891 --> 01:14:57.458
-That's two.

01:15:03.265 --> 01:15:05.500
You okay, dad?

01:15:05.502 --> 01:15:07.168
-Yeah. Take it out.

01:15:17.045 --> 01:15:19.580
-That's a foul.
-Oh, yeah?

01:15:19.582 --> 01:15:21.482
Why don't you call it then?

01:15:21.484 --> 01:15:23.551
Hey, ref!

01:15:23.553 --> 01:15:25.486
Two from the line!

01:15:34.062 --> 01:15:35.062
-Dad, you can't hold me
like that.

01:15:35.064 --> 01:15:36.998
-Oh, yeah? Fine.

01:15:59.221 --> 01:16:01.322
What, you want
a written invitation?

01:16:16.172 --> 01:16:19.240
-What happened?
-God!

01:16:19.242 --> 01:16:21.242
-What happened? Hey, hey, hey!
-Get the fuck away from me!

01:16:21.244 --> 01:16:23.544
-<i> What happened?</i>
-Get the fuck away from me!

01:16:23.546 --> 01:16:26.147
-What happened? Get away!
-<i> He fell.</i>

01:16:26.149 --> 01:16:27.481
-Get back!

01:16:27.483 --> 01:16:28.816
<i> Stay away!</i>

01:16:28.818 --> 01:16:30.084
<i> Okay, okay.</i>

01:16:30.086 --> 01:16:31.419
<i> Talk to me. Talk to me,</i>
<i> tell me where it is.</i>

01:16:31.421 --> 01:16:32.486
<i> Where is it?</i>
-You alright?

01:16:32.488 --> 01:16:34.455
- <i> My knee!</i>
<i>- Okay, okay.</i>

01:16:34.457 --> 01:16:36.157
<i> We've gotta get him up.</i>
-God!

01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:40.127
-<i> It's unusual</i>
<i> what we have here.</i>

01:16:40.129 --> 01:16:42.430
<i> It's called</i>
<i> a bucket handle tear.</i>

01:16:42.432 --> 01:16:45.366
In some instances the meniscus
can be flipped back

01:16:45.368 --> 01:16:48.469
but in others,
the torn piece gets stuck.

01:16:48.471 --> 01:16:50.838
<i> That's the reason</i>
<i> it's so painful.</i>

01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:52.840
-But if it could be flipped,
i could play, right?

01:16:52.842 --> 01:16:55.610
-It would be swollen and sore,
and I wouldn't recommend it

01:16:55.612 --> 01:16:57.178
but technically yes.

01:16:57.180 --> 01:16:58.546
-Do it.
-No. No, Anthony.

01:16:58.548 --> 01:17:01.115
-What do you know about it,
mom?

01:17:01.117 --> 01:17:03.351
-<i> We could relocate</i>
<i> your knee by snapping it</i>

01:17:03.353 --> 01:17:06.020
into full extension,
but there's a possibility

01:17:06.022 --> 01:17:08.155
of tearing it further
if we force it.

01:17:08.157 --> 01:17:11.258
-It's a stupid risk.
-They will not win without me.

01:17:16.031 --> 01:17:19.834
-<i> If you can't play,</i>
<i> you can't play. Okay?</i>

01:17:19.836 --> 01:17:23.204
-<i> I'm recommending surgery</i>
<i> to start the healing process.</i>

01:17:23.206 --> 01:17:25.306
<i> You don't have to</i>
<i> decide right now.</i>

01:17:25.308 --> 01:17:28.175
<i> Take some time</i>
<i> and discuss it as a family.</i>

01:17:51.199 --> 01:17:53.367
-I should have
protected him from you.

01:17:58.874 --> 01:18:01.742
Not just the leg. Everything.

01:18:01.744 --> 01:18:04.245
-Oh, for..

01:18:04.247 --> 01:18:06.681
Jenny, look,
you think I don't feel terrible?

01:18:12.988 --> 01:18:15.523
-My mother used to say

01:18:15.525 --> 01:18:18.259
she may not have known
when she had enough

01:18:18.261 --> 01:18:20.594
but she knew
when she had too much.

01:18:26.234 --> 01:18:27.702
-Hmm.

01:18:33.942 --> 01:18:36.410
It can't be true that
they can't win without him.

01:18:38.914 --> 01:18:40.881
-He is that special.

01:18:49.891 --> 01:18:51.358
-Maybe you're right.

01:18:55.964 --> 01:18:59.033
Yeah. We'll be okay.

01:19:18.421 --> 01:19:19.954
-Come in.

01:19:55.391 --> 01:19:57.324
I'm so sorry.

01:20:22.484 --> 01:20:23.584
-What, you think I'm crazy?

01:20:23.586 --> 01:20:25.820
-No, I don't think
you're crazy.

01:20:25.822 --> 01:20:27.922
I mean, I think that, uh..

01:20:27.924 --> 01:20:29.857
It's a shitload to take..

01:20:29.859 --> 01:20:32.326
Hey, ant.
What are you doing up?

01:20:32.328 --> 01:20:34.361
You should be resting.

01:20:34.363 --> 01:20:37.264
-What are you, what are you
doing here, uncle Charlie?

01:20:37.266 --> 01:20:39.767
-Well, he's kinda upset, so..

01:20:44.673 --> 01:20:47.908
Come on, I'll walk you back.
Let's go.

01:20:47.910 --> 01:20:49.476
-Okay.

01:20:51.746 --> 01:20:53.614
-<i> How's it feeling?</i>

01:20:53.616 --> 01:20:55.583
-<i> I can't straighten it, so..</i>

01:20:59.921 --> 01:21:01.255
-Hey.
-<i> Hmm.</i>

01:21:01.257 --> 01:21:04.325
-You know he'd trade places
with you if he could.

01:21:07.095 --> 01:21:08.629
-Night.

01:21:13.969 --> 01:21:15.069
-<i> You know, booms,</i>
<i> there's another game</i>

01:21:15.071 --> 01:21:16.637
<i> we gotta mention,</i>
<i> and it's local.</i>

01:21:16.639 --> 01:21:18.505
<i> It's that rematch</i>
<i> of last year's high school</i>

01:21:18.507 --> 01:21:20.174
<i> d-1 city finals.</i>

01:21:20.176 --> 01:21:22.710
-Alright, alright,
Saint coming through.
Excuse me, excuse me.

01:21:22.712 --> 01:21:25.379
-<i> It's St. Anthony's</i>
<i> and George Washington</i>

01:21:25.381 --> 01:21:28.249
<i> and that was a game</i>
<i> decided by one single point.</i>

01:21:28.251 --> 01:21:30.117
<i> And you know how close</i>
<i> that is, right, boom?</i>

01:21:30.119 --> 01:21:32.253
-<i> Can't get</i>
<i> any closer, craigy.</i>

01:21:32.255 --> 01:21:35.456
-<i> Listen, Anthony's was dope</i>
<i> this year, 23 and 4.</i>

01:21:35.458 --> 01:21:38.425
<i> But George Washington</i>
<i> played 27 games</i>

01:21:38.427 --> 01:21:40.160
<i> they were 26 and 1.</i>

01:21:40.162 --> 01:21:41.562
-<i> It means</i>
<i> they don't lose a lot.</i>

01:21:41.564 --> 01:21:45.766
-<i> Again, the Maryland</i>
<i> education coming through.</i>

01:21:45.768 --> 01:21:47.501
<i> I should point out</i>
<i> that the game today</i>

01:21:47.503 --> 01:21:50.371
<i> features not one,</i>
<i> but two stud players.</i>

01:21:50.373 --> 01:21:54.008
<i> Anthony Keller, who's got</i>
<i> Russell westbrook stats, boom.</i>

01:21:54.010 --> 01:21:56.110
-<i> Don't insult the kid by</i>
<i> comparing him to westbrook.</i>

01:21:56.112 --> 01:21:58.145
-<i> Boomer, the kid's great.</i>
<i> His numbers are awesome.</i>

01:21:58.147 --> 01:22:00.981
<i> Twenty three points,</i>
<i> seven boards and ten dishes --</i>

01:22:00.983 --> 01:22:02.950
-<i> yeah, let me guess, the same</i>
<i> number of championships</i>

01:22:02.952 --> 01:22:04.251
<i> as westbrook as well, right?</i>

01:22:04.253 --> 01:22:06.020
-<i> See, now you're just</i>
<i> being mean, man.</i>

01:22:06.022 --> 01:22:08.255
<i> On the other side</i>
<i> of the court, you know</i>
<i> who I'm talking about</i>

01:22:08.257 --> 01:22:11.158
<i> t-dub senior stud,</i>
<i> Eduardo jimenez.</i>

01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:12.993
<i> This kid was the league mvp</i>

01:22:12.995 --> 01:22:15.262
<i> and his numbers</i>
<i> are more Jordan-esque</i>

01:22:15.264 --> 01:22:17.097
<i> thirty points per game.</i>

01:22:18.266 --> 01:22:20.267
<i> That's a bunch</i>
<i> of monster numbers</i>

01:22:20.269 --> 01:22:22.436
<i> for both these kids, meaning..</i>

01:22:22.438 --> 01:22:24.204
<i> Huh?</i>

01:22:24.206 --> 01:22:25.539
<i> What are you flailing</i>
<i> all around for?</i>

01:22:25.541 --> 01:22:27.441
-<i> Well, as usual,</i>
<i> your brilliant</i>

01:22:27.443 --> 01:22:30.811
<i> statistical analysis</i>
<i> left out one major point.</i>

01:22:30.813 --> 01:22:32.513
-He's sorry.

01:22:32.515 --> 01:22:33.747
He wants to talk to you
about something.

01:22:33.749 --> 01:22:35.049
Is this a good time?

01:22:35.051 --> 01:22:36.817
-<i> It's all good.</i>
<i> What did I miss?</i>

01:22:36.819 --> 01:22:38.252
-<i> One of those studs, Keller..</i>

01:22:39.789 --> 01:22:42.289

-You're kinda cute.
You got a sister?

01:39:36.805 --> 01:39:37.904
How old is she?

Look at me! Look at me
when I talk to you!

01:39:47.515 --> 01:39:49.549

We don't need a basket.

01:39:51.386 --> 01:39:52.485
