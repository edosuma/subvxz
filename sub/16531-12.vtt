WEBVTT

00:01.369 --> 00:03.537
ANNOUNCER: Thanks for
downloading this Fox show.

00:03.571 --> 00:05.739
And don't miss
all-new episodes on Fox.

00:07.007 --> 00:10.978
Previously on Empire...
There is no us. You're still
in the closet, anyway.

00:11.011 --> 00:13.081
Those suspicious-looking
people over there

00:13.114 --> 00:14.682
are looking for you.
LUCIOUS: It's Tariq.

00:14.715 --> 00:16.317
He thinks that you're
gonna flip on something.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.419
I don't know anything
about Cookie.
That's a subpoena.

00:18.452 --> 00:21.655
When Lucious finds out, he'll
arrange for you to disappear.

00:21.689 --> 00:22.990
So you can accept the
government's protection,

00:23.023 --> 00:24.925
or you can take your chances.

00:24.958 --> 00:26.094
Maybe I should go.

00:26.127 --> 00:28.196
Maybe you should stay.

00:28.229 --> 00:30.564
You know who Rafael is?
Very big hitter in Vegas.

00:30.598 --> 00:33.101
I set up a meeting tomorrow
night. You interested?

00:33.134 --> 00:35.035
I've been trying to get Empire
into the Vegas market for years.

00:35.069 --> 00:36.604
Some reason Pop won't touch it.
(gunshot)

00:36.637 --> 00:38.939
GIULIANA: Sorry we got off
to such a messy start,

00:38.972 --> 00:41.975
but I'm still available to do
business if you're interested.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.812
*

00:50.951 --> 00:53.454
Wake up, man.

00:53.487 --> 00:56.424
Was I dreaming last night
or did we fill the hot tub

00:56.457 --> 00:58.459
up with syrup?

00:58.492 --> 01:00.361
How we gonna top this tomorrow?

01:00.394 --> 01:02.296
Tomorrow's about to be
next level.

01:02.330 --> 01:03.964
Hakeem the Dream
turns 21.

01:03.997 --> 01:06.467
Yeah, bro. So, uh,
is moms and pops

01:06.500 --> 01:08.236
gon' hit you with
this party or what?
They like

01:08.269 --> 01:10.204
to surprise me, so y'all gonna
have to wait and see.

01:10.238 --> 01:11.972
But best and believe

01:12.005 --> 01:13.574
tomorrow's gonna be

01:13.607 --> 01:16.210
the biggest night of
my life, and y'alls.

01:16.244 --> 01:17.245
Y'all gonna be telling
y'all kids

01:17.278 --> 01:18.546
about this legendary turn-up.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.114
Well, I don't plan on
having kids,

01:20.148 --> 01:21.415
but I'll tell yours.

01:21.449 --> 01:23.917
Hey, everybody wake up.

01:23.951 --> 01:26.554
We got waffles!

01:26.587 --> 01:28.589
(phone ringing)

01:35.163 --> 01:37.165
Oh, man.

01:37.198 --> 01:40.100
We're gonna be doing this
social media thing, y'all.

01:40.134 --> 01:43.003
I mean, I can't remember the
last time I was so nervous.

01:43.036 --> 01:44.405
But I've been hiding, y'all.

01:44.438 --> 01:45.773
I've been hiding

01:45.806 --> 01:47.841
my entire life.

01:47.875 --> 01:51.779
I'm about to lose somebody
that I love

01:51.812 --> 01:54.315
because they can't be with me
because they can't stand

01:54.348 --> 01:56.450
me not being true to myself.

01:58.519 --> 02:00.588
So, Jamal,

02:00.621 --> 02:02.623
yo, I'm out here
in these streets, baby.

02:02.656 --> 02:05.193
I'm coming up to see you.

02:05.226 --> 02:06.594
Philip.
Hmm?

02:06.627 --> 02:08.462
D-MAJOR: I'm here to see Jamal.
Wake up. Get dressed.

02:08.496 --> 02:10.631
That's right,
he's expecting me.
DOORMAN: Yes, sir.

02:10.664 --> 02:12.833
(elevator bell dings)

02:12.866 --> 02:15.002
I know some of you out there
won't be feeling this,

02:15.035 --> 02:17.171
but if you can't accept me
for who I am,

02:17.205 --> 02:18.706
that's you.

02:18.739 --> 02:20.474
So now about to
make it official

02:20.508 --> 02:21.842
with the man that
changed my life.

02:21.875 --> 02:22.876
(elevator bell chimes)

02:24.545 --> 02:25.813
All right.

02:29.550 --> 02:31.485
Hey, babe.

02:33.587 --> 02:35.389
What the hell?

02:38.392 --> 02:40.394
*

02:45.399 --> 02:47.735
You kidding me?
You and soldier boy?

02:47.768 --> 02:49.703
Derek, what the hell
are you doing right now?

02:49.737 --> 02:50.704
And get up out of my house!

02:50.738 --> 02:52.473
I did what you
told me to do.

02:52.506 --> 02:54.074
What I told you to do?
Yeah.

02:54.107 --> 02:55.209
You said the only reason
we're not together

02:55.243 --> 02:56.310
is because I'm not
living my truth,

02:56.344 --> 02:57.345
so I changed all that.

02:57.378 --> 02:59.146
What?
I'm out of here.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.681
No, wait, Philip.
You don't have to.

03:00.714 --> 03:02.816
Hey, you misunderstood me,
all right?

03:02.850 --> 03:04.252
Philip, you don't have to go.

03:04.285 --> 03:05.519
Yeah, well, you need
to straighten this out.

03:05.553 --> 03:06.920
I'll talk to you later.

03:09.923 --> 03:11.592
What kind of game you
playing with me, man?

03:11.625 --> 03:12.893
So how long you been
smashing this dude?

03:12.926 --> 03:14.228
Ain't none of your
damn business, Derek.

03:14.262 --> 03:15.429
Get the hell up
out of my place.

03:15.463 --> 03:16.430
We need to talk.
Like hell we do!

03:16.464 --> 03:17.465
Now!

03:28.075 --> 03:30.478
*

03:31.979 --> 03:33.213
What's up?

03:33.247 --> 03:35.449
All set for tomorrow,
player.

03:38.486 --> 03:39.553
What are you doing?

03:39.587 --> 03:40.754
You know your pops
gonna kill you

03:40.788 --> 03:42.122
trying to get
in his business like that.

03:42.155 --> 03:44.057
Nah, we do this
every year.

03:44.091 --> 03:45.693
He pretends
I ain't snooping,

03:45.726 --> 03:47.295
I pretend to be surprised
when he show me

03:47.328 --> 03:48.962
what he got me
for my birthday.

03:48.996 --> 03:51.131
So it seems that she
got away from Marty

03:51.164 --> 03:52.533
for a hot minute
the other day,

03:52.566 --> 03:54.201
and went to go visit
your half-brother.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.604
Now, why did you
go see Tariq?

03:56.637 --> 03:57.971
Dwight said
if I helped him

03:58.005 --> 04:00.207
with Fatima's bastard,

04:00.240 --> 04:02.776
that that awful wife person

04:02.810 --> 04:04.712
wouldn't live with us
anymore.

04:04.745 --> 04:07.047
But he broke his promise,

04:07.080 --> 04:09.817
so I got Tariq to handle it.

04:09.850 --> 04:12.420
So Tariq is still
coming for me.

04:12.453 --> 04:14.922
And now he's trying
to flip Anika.

04:14.955 --> 04:18.058
But she doesn't have anything
on me, does she, Lucious?

04:18.091 --> 04:21.595
I never said anything...
(clears throat)

04:21.629 --> 04:25.132
...to her outright, but who
knows what she overheard.

04:25.165 --> 04:26.233
(clears throat)

04:26.266 --> 04:28.235
What's that?

04:28.268 --> 04:30.103
You getting that ALS again?

04:30.137 --> 04:32.005
I never had ALS.

04:32.039 --> 04:33.607
I have myasthenia gravis.

04:33.641 --> 04:36.610
What is that?
Does it kill you?

04:36.644 --> 04:39.647
I just get really
exasperated

04:39.680 --> 04:43.216
dealing with incompetent people
who can't do their job.

04:44.718 --> 04:46.954
The surprise over!

04:48.055 --> 04:50.190
Boy, what do you want?

04:52.793 --> 04:54.962
I got to give it
to y'all, y'all good.

04:54.995 --> 04:56.129
I don't...

04:56.163 --> 04:57.631
I mean, if y'all
haven't decided on

04:57.665 --> 04:59.667
getting me a present...

04:59.700 --> 05:01.168
Bugatti Veyron.

05:01.201 --> 05:02.636
HAKEEM: I'm thinking
about the black and the red

05:02.670 --> 05:04.304
two-tone.

05:04.338 --> 05:06.006
Some gold rims
on there, Dad.

05:06.039 --> 05:07.941
Wait, you want another car?

05:07.975 --> 05:09.176
Mm-hmm.

05:09.209 --> 05:11.111
I mean, I got an
Olds 98 for sale.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.881
Clean with a gangsta lean.
It might be too, uh,

05:13.914 --> 05:15.215
too much car for
the young 'un, though.

05:15.248 --> 05:16.850
(Hakeem sighs)
Did I blow it?

05:16.884 --> 05:18.619
Are y'all not planning
a surprise party, or what?

05:18.652 --> 05:21.054
Look, boy, we know
it's your birthday, okay?

05:21.088 --> 05:23.223
Happy birthday.
But we can't celebrate it

05:23.256 --> 05:25.225
until some of this drama
dies down, okay?

05:25.258 --> 05:27.628
Mom, this is my biggest
birthday party.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.196
I'm about to turn 21.

05:29.229 --> 05:30.998
Well, why don't you
act like it?

05:32.433 --> 05:36.036
How do you let Anika...
(clears throat)

05:36.069 --> 05:38.706
...take off and leave
the baby with you

05:38.739 --> 05:40.908
without telling you
where she's going?

05:40.941 --> 05:43.777
What do you mean,
"take off"?

05:45.078 --> 05:46.279
She's not home?

05:50.718 --> 05:52.920
(scoffs)

05:52.953 --> 05:55.889
Apparently not.

05:55.923 --> 05:57.925
(lyrical piano playing)

06:00.227 --> 06:05.466
* People talk and
people think what they want *

06:06.900 --> 06:11.238
* Questioning how we love *

06:11.271 --> 06:15.776
* Undeniably,
you're all I see *

06:15.809 --> 06:19.580
* And it don't matter when *

06:19.613 --> 06:22.115
* How or where *

06:22.149 --> 06:25.218
* You need to lean on me *

06:25.252 --> 06:29.289
* There's no day or time
or place *

06:29.322 --> 06:33.193
* To stop me *

06:33.226 --> 06:37.698
* From giving my loyalty *

06:37.731 --> 06:42.369
* From giving you
all of me *

06:42.402 --> 06:45.439
* I'll be your everything *

06:45.473 --> 06:49.376
* I wanna,
I wanna be everything *

06:49.409 --> 06:51.244
* I'll be... *

06:51.278 --> 06:52.580
GIULIANA:
Is that your lady?

06:54.314 --> 06:57.150
As a matter of fact,
yes, it is.

06:57.184 --> 06:58.986
Lucky girl.

06:59.019 --> 07:00.788
* A calm from the storm
up ahead... *

07:00.821 --> 07:02.556
Do you mind if I sit?

07:02.590 --> 07:05.058
Please.
* I'll be steady *

07:05.092 --> 07:07.728
* The rock, the rope,
the weight... *

07:07.761 --> 07:09.229
So what do you
think about her

07:09.262 --> 07:11.164
opening your club
in Vegas?

07:11.198 --> 07:12.466
My former little
strip club

07:12.500 --> 07:14.968
that doesn't even have
a cabaret license?

07:15.002 --> 07:17.004
* Your mind can be sure *

07:17.037 --> 07:18.606
We can help with that.

07:18.639 --> 07:21.108
* It can rest in me
forever more... *

07:21.141 --> 07:23.644
So if I book Nessa
for my grand opening,

07:23.677 --> 07:27.280
what is that gonna do for
my relationship with Empire?

07:27.314 --> 07:29.282
ANDRE: Well, Nessa's got
a lot of heat right now.

07:29.316 --> 07:31.685
Empire will put the full
power of our resources

07:31.719 --> 07:33.186
behind her first
solo show.

07:33.220 --> 07:36.757
I wish I had someone
like you around

07:36.790 --> 07:38.358
when I was starting out.

07:38.391 --> 07:40.661
* The breath that
you need to breathe... *

07:40.694 --> 07:41.795
Are you a singer?

07:41.829 --> 07:43.964
I tried it for a minute,

07:43.997 --> 07:45.533
but then I decided

07:45.566 --> 07:47.267
talent has no power.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.502
I want to be the boss.

07:48.536 --> 07:51.371
* I'll be your everything... *

07:51.404 --> 07:53.541
Why don't you met me
here tomorrow night,

07:53.574 --> 07:55.475
and we can talk about it?

07:55.509 --> 07:57.010
* I'll be *
Okay.

07:57.044 --> 07:59.012
* I'll be. *

07:59.046 --> 08:01.849
Have a good evening.

08:04.051 --> 08:05.753
*

08:09.523 --> 08:11.559
No, I just thought
that we had decided

08:11.592 --> 08:14.161
that, uh, that you were
gonna let me

08:14.194 --> 08:15.796
handle things like this
from here on out,

08:15.829 --> 08:17.665
not, uh, not Lucious.

08:17.698 --> 08:19.667
I know, I...
I didn't even know

08:19.700 --> 08:21.234
what the meeting
was about.

08:21.268 --> 08:22.836
I thought it was
a business thing.

08:22.870 --> 08:25.973
Look, do you or don't you
have a connect to find out

08:26.006 --> 08:27.641
where they've got
Anika stashed?

08:27.675 --> 08:30.043
Uh, I'm gonna have to dig.

08:30.077 --> 08:31.478
But before I do my digging,

08:31.511 --> 08:32.713
you got to tell me,
what are you hiding?

08:34.181 --> 08:35.949
What does Anika have on you?

08:38.619 --> 08:40.120
I'm not hiding anything.

08:42.590 --> 08:44.958
I'm starting to think you
don't trust me here, Angelo.

08:50.030 --> 08:52.032
What is this?

08:54.067 --> 08:57.170
Um...

08:57.204 --> 08:59.072
a gun?

09:02.042 --> 09:03.911
Why do you have it?

09:03.944 --> 09:06.013
Look, possession
of a handgun

09:06.046 --> 09:07.781
is illegal in New York.

09:07.815 --> 09:09.516
All right, I'm running
for mayor here.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.184
I got primaries
in ten days...

09:11.218 --> 09:12.853
It was a gift, okay?

09:12.886 --> 09:15.122
It was a gift.
I've never used it,

09:15.155 --> 09:17.424
and I don't plan on
using it.
A gift?

09:20.293 --> 09:21.829
It was a gift from Lucious?

09:25.498 --> 09:27.601
Well, look, I need you
to get rid of it.

09:27.635 --> 09:32.139
Okay, Cookie, whether
I become mayor or not,

09:32.172 --> 09:34.374
I'm trying to build
a life with you.

09:34.407 --> 09:36.376
And that means you're
gonna have to put...

09:36.409 --> 09:38.045
you're gonna have to put
things like this away.

09:38.078 --> 09:40.213
Things that, uh, they
don't belong in our world.

09:40.247 --> 09:43.250
Okay, I'll get rid of it.

09:43.283 --> 09:44.652
It's gone from our world.

09:44.685 --> 09:46.286
Okay, I'll get rid of this
and everything

09:46.319 --> 09:47.554
he's ever given to me.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.289
Is that better?

09:49.322 --> 09:51.291
For real?
Mm-hmm.

09:51.324 --> 09:52.592
You promise?

09:52.626 --> 09:54.762
I promise.

09:59.132 --> 10:00.668
You ever shoot anybody?

10:03.536 --> 10:05.405
* How you think I feel
to see another MC *

10:05.438 --> 10:07.440
* Get paid
usin' my rap style *

10:07.474 --> 10:09.576
* And I'm playing'
the background meanwhile *

10:09.609 --> 10:12.412
* I ain't with that,
you can forget that *

10:12.445 --> 10:15.015
* You took my style,
I'm takin' it back... *

10:15.048 --> 10:16.616
Lucious ain't here.

10:16.650 --> 10:19.619
Who said I was here
for Lucious?

10:25.058 --> 10:27.861
Yo! You buggin'?
Get out!

10:27.895 --> 10:29.329
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey.

10:29.362 --> 10:30.664
Hey.
Get out!

10:30.698 --> 10:32.432
Chill out, schoolgirl.

10:32.465 --> 10:35.202
Lucious don't like nobody
playing with his piece.

10:35.235 --> 10:37.270
Like I said...

10:37.304 --> 10:39.506
Lucious ain't here.

10:39.539 --> 10:41.108
Come on, now, we both know
you're not gonna shoot no...

10:41.141 --> 10:42.509
(gunshot)
(yelling in pain)

10:43.711 --> 10:44.845
My knee!

10:44.878 --> 10:45.946
(sobbing)

10:45.979 --> 10:47.681
Oh, my knee!

10:47.715 --> 10:49.516
(yells)

10:50.550 --> 10:51.685
No.

10:51.719 --> 10:52.986
Never.

10:53.020 --> 10:54.888
*

10:54.922 --> 10:56.656
All right.

11:02.262 --> 11:04.898
Did you get the phone?
Yeah. It's
a prepaid.

11:04.932 --> 11:06.233
Can't be traced.

11:06.266 --> 11:08.068
I still don't think
this is a good idea.

11:08.101 --> 11:09.569
Okay, you know what, Mom?
If I had gone

11:09.602 --> 11:10.971
with Tariq,
then Lucious would have found me

11:11.004 --> 11:12.305
and I would have been dead
by now.

11:12.339 --> 11:13.874
All right?
So let me just...

11:13.907 --> 11:15.642
give him a call,
tell him I have a plan.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.077
Hopefully he'll
let me come home.

11:17.110 --> 11:18.879
Because at this point,
this is the only way

11:18.912 --> 11:21.414
that any of us are gonna get
a chance to see Bella.

11:25.919 --> 11:28.822
So, check it, we're gonna be
club-hopping 21 hours straight.

11:28.856 --> 11:30.090
All my fans' Empire
XStream subscription,

11:30.123 --> 11:31.591
that's your invite.

11:31.624 --> 11:33.060
So stay logged in,
'cause I'm gonna be

11:33.093 --> 11:35.162
dropping hints all night,
so y'all can figure out

11:35.195 --> 11:37.097
what club we're
hopping to next.

11:37.130 --> 11:38.098
Yah!

11:38.131 --> 11:39.867
TIANA:
Damn. I wish

11:39.900 --> 11:41.268
I was gonna be there.

11:41.301 --> 11:43.003
I'm so sorry, babe.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.872
We'll just have to celebrate
when I get back from this tour.

11:44.905 --> 11:47.607
Promise.
I promise.

11:48.942 --> 11:50.744
And there y'all
have it.

11:50.778 --> 11:53.013
That's how Takeem keep
that long-distance love

11:53.046 --> 11:54.381
hot and heavy.

11:54.414 --> 11:56.583
But you got to watch
all night to get the clues

11:56.616 --> 11:58.085
and ride Hakeem's
birthday train.

11:58.118 --> 11:59.686
Choo-choo!

11:59.719 --> 12:01.121
We out.

12:01.154 --> 12:02.522
It's gonna be lit.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.724
Litty.
It better be.

12:06.293 --> 12:09.729
(quietly): Just bummed
Tiana not gonna be there.

12:15.168 --> 12:16.636
(sighs)

12:16.669 --> 12:17.971
Wow.

12:20.440 --> 12:24.878
Where's your, uh...
producer friend, Tory?

12:24.912 --> 12:25.879
She's gone.

12:25.913 --> 12:28.115
She, uh, died of thirst.

12:28.148 --> 12:29.783
(chuckles)

12:32.986 --> 12:34.621
Sit down.

12:39.459 --> 12:42.095
(sighs)

12:42.129 --> 12:44.731
Derek, what the hell
were you thinking?

12:44.764 --> 12:46.800
Uh...

12:46.834 --> 12:50.137
you said that
we couldn't be together

12:50.170 --> 12:52.139
because I was in the closet.

12:52.172 --> 12:54.507
So I came out.

12:54.541 --> 12:56.409
You don't come out
for someone else.

12:56.443 --> 12:57.945
You come out for yourself.

12:57.978 --> 12:59.980
And you don't throw my
name into the situation,

13:00.013 --> 13:01.448
especially when it's
on social media.

13:01.481 --> 13:04.084
Man, I am trying here.

13:04.117 --> 13:07.187
It's not like there's some
playbook for this, you know?

13:07.220 --> 13:09.289
(softly):
I'm scared, man.

13:09.322 --> 13:12.159
I got cats turning
their back on me.

13:12.192 --> 13:15.028
You know how
this hip-hop game is.

13:17.497 --> 13:19.332
Yeah, I know.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.337
I'm sorry you got to
deal with that.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.776
I just wish that you would've
talked to me first, you know?

13:29.809 --> 13:31.011
In person.

13:31.044 --> 13:33.646
I done lost
three gigs already, man.

13:33.680 --> 13:36.616
I got these cats
clowning me on Twitter.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.118
It's like I'm spiraling, man.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.220
I-I'm like, I'm losing,
I'm struggling.

13:40.253 --> 13:42.055
Yeah, yeah.

13:42.089 --> 13:43.790
What is he
doing here, Jamal?

13:43.823 --> 13:45.158
It's all right, Ma.

13:45.192 --> 13:46.326
Uh-uh, no, it's not all right.

13:46.359 --> 13:47.995
He was your supplier.

13:48.028 --> 13:49.829
You're not supposed to be around
people who enabled you.

13:49.863 --> 13:51.364
What are you talking about?
I didn't enable...

13:51.398 --> 13:53.466
Boy, you know what I'm talking
about. You better back down.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.868
Ma, he has never been
my supplier.

13:57.537 --> 13:59.306
Look, we'll, we'll...

13:59.339 --> 14:00.974
deal with this another
time, all right?

14:01.008 --> 14:03.010
Figure something out together,
but right now,

14:03.043 --> 14:05.312
I need to talk to my mom.
Yeah, he needs to talk
to his mother.

14:05.345 --> 14:06.479
Maybe you should go
talk to yours.

14:06.513 --> 14:07.680
Mom, please.
That makes sense.

14:07.714 --> 14:09.416
You guys do the
family thing, man.

14:09.449 --> 14:10.517
COOKIE:
Yeah, bye-bye.

14:10.550 --> 14:11.818
All right,
Queen B.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.686
Mm-hmm. Keep your
dirty hands to yourself.

14:13.720 --> 14:15.855
Mom, please.
What?

14:15.889 --> 14:18.225
And what, what,
what are you, get... Bye!

14:20.127 --> 14:21.895
What are you doing, Jamal?
I know.

14:21.929 --> 14:23.997
I mean, but the fool
came out for me.

14:24.031 --> 14:26.266
And I know it was stupid or
whatever on social media,

14:26.299 --> 14:28.168
but he feels really
exposed right now.

14:28.201 --> 14:29.602
You don't know what
that feels like.

14:29.636 --> 14:31.271
I don't give a damn
about his feelings.

14:31.304 --> 14:33.373
You better dump his ass
before you lose Philip.

14:33.406 --> 14:35.075
Oh, okay, Ma.

14:35.108 --> 14:38.445
Well, how about you drop Dad
before you lose Angelo?

14:38.478 --> 14:40.747
Oh, shut your stupid ass up,
didn't nobody come down here

14:40.780 --> 14:42.582
to talk about that.
Tell you what,

14:42.615 --> 14:44.051
you worry about
your dirty laundry,

14:44.084 --> 14:45.285
and I'll worry about mine.

14:45.318 --> 14:46.886
Sounds like a plan.
Okay.

14:46.920 --> 14:49.222
Look, I just came to see

14:49.256 --> 14:51.925
if you're gonna show up
for your brother tonight.
Of course.

14:51.959 --> 14:54.027
Dre and I are gonna go there,
um, when he hits Laviticus.

14:54.061 --> 14:55.963
He has no idea.
(chuckles)
Mm-hmm.

14:55.996 --> 14:57.364
You coming?
No.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.099
Keem don't want to club
with his mama.

14:59.132 --> 15:01.568
Plus, me and Angelo
have a dinner

15:01.601 --> 15:03.703
with these bourgie
black folk.

15:03.736 --> 15:06.373
You know, they don't
even bother me anymore, Jamal.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.441
Am I losing my street cred?

15:08.475 --> 15:09.709
Maybe.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.278
I mean, is that
such a bad thing?

15:11.311 --> 15:13.313
I don't know.

15:13.346 --> 15:15.615
I'm gonna be myself,
I'll tell you that much.

15:15.648 --> 15:17.084
Just a little more polished.

15:17.117 --> 15:19.086
(laughs)
Okay.

15:19.119 --> 15:21.754
Boy, get up, I got to go get
my hair done for tonight.

15:21.788 --> 15:23.490
Bye. Love you.

15:23.523 --> 15:25.658
I love you too.
Stay away from that trash.

15:25.692 --> 15:27.060
Stay away from
my dirty daddy.

15:27.094 --> 15:28.928
Shut up. By the way,
me and your father

15:28.962 --> 15:30.797
took care of your doorman.

15:30.830 --> 15:31.931
How?

15:33.200 --> 15:36.203
Ma?
Shut up, boy.

15:38.838 --> 15:40.940
Hakeem, I thought you were
supposed to get smarter as

15:40.974 --> 15:42.809
you got older, not dumber.
HAKEEM: Shut up, man.

15:42.842 --> 15:44.777
ANDRE: I'm not letting you
stream your birthday mess

15:44.811 --> 15:47.647
live on Empire XStream,
all right?
What's your problem, man?

15:47.680 --> 15:49.482
What's your problem, man?!
LUCIOUS:
Hold on, hold on!

15:49.516 --> 15:51.418
What's going on?
Let him have his fun.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.353
It's harmless.

15:53.386 --> 15:54.988
I can think of a million ways
it could become

15:55.022 --> 15:56.256
harmful for us, Pop.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.091
The cost of security alone...

15:58.125 --> 15:59.759
I'll pull in ten times
the cost of security

15:59.792 --> 16:01.528
with all the cash I'll be making
on my club appearances.

16:01.561 --> 16:03.163
Why do you keep raising
your voice in here?

16:03.196 --> 16:04.764
'Cause he getting on my nerves.

16:04.797 --> 16:07.667
Look, it's his birthday.
Let him have his fun.

16:07.700 --> 16:11.038
Oh, by the way, I'm so sorry,
I'm not gonna make it.

16:11.071 --> 16:14.307
Dad, it's bad enough my whole
family trying to bail on me now.

16:14.341 --> 16:15.875
Now Andre's trying
to wreck my party?

16:18.811 --> 16:20.313
I'm outta here.
Nice job.

16:20.347 --> 16:22.182
He looks pretty
disappointed.

16:22.215 --> 16:24.284
Yeah, he really thinks we're
just ignoring his big day.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.186
(laughs)
Oh, man, you guys, boy.

16:26.219 --> 16:29.022
He's surprised when he don't
get that Bugatti from me.

16:29.056 --> 16:31.291
Aw, he wants that car.
(laughs)
Yeah, he's out of his damn mind.

16:31.324 --> 16:32.559
I ain't buying him that.

16:32.592 --> 16:35.062
What's up with this,
um, Vegas thing?

16:35.095 --> 16:36.696
Tell me.

16:36.729 --> 16:38.065
I don't know.

16:38.098 --> 16:39.999
I tried to call the
guy back. Nothing.

16:40.033 --> 16:41.401
Hmm.

16:44.037 --> 16:45.238
What?

16:45.272 --> 16:47.207
Uh, nothing.

16:47.240 --> 16:49.076
You thinking about doing
some business in Vegas?

16:49.109 --> 16:51.044
I mean, I hate Vegas.

16:51.078 --> 16:53.580
I think it's grimy, and there's
no upside for our business,

16:53.613 --> 16:55.848
but we get this anonymous tip

16:55.882 --> 16:58.685
saying that
there's this huge

16:58.718 --> 17:01.154
business opportunity
for us in...

17:01.188 --> 17:02.822
You sure you don't know
nothing about this?

17:02.855 --> 17:04.591
No.

17:04.624 --> 17:05.992
Okay.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.094
I'm gonna see you, Dre.
Yep.

17:07.127 --> 17:08.361
All right, Dre.
Bye, Pop.

17:25.245 --> 17:27.114
QUEENIE:
Just... Yeah, that's good.

17:27.147 --> 17:30.117
Cookie, I'm running
a little behind, darling.

17:30.150 --> 17:31.918
Mm-hmm, that's all good.
You just need to tell

17:31.951 --> 17:34.254
whoever that is
they got to bounce.
I'm sorry, tell me what?

17:34.287 --> 17:36.423
Tell you that you got to
get out of that chair

17:36.456 --> 17:38.125
'cause it's time
for my appointment.

17:38.158 --> 17:40.893
Oh, well, we'll be done shortly.
Oh. (sarcastic chuckle)

17:40.927 --> 17:43.196
Give me one second
please, madam?
Of course.

17:43.230 --> 17:45.865
I'm sorry, Cookie.

17:45.898 --> 17:48.468
She came in off the streets,
put down two stacks,

17:48.501 --> 17:50.036
and her friends
over there

17:50.069 --> 17:51.904
were hella persuasive about it.

17:51.938 --> 17:53.140
Who are they?

17:53.173 --> 17:54.474
(phone rings)
Oh.

17:54.507 --> 17:56.643
Lucious, what the hell
do you want?

17:56.676 --> 17:58.645
LUCIOUS:
Cookie, Anika called.

17:58.678 --> 18:01.448
Says she wants to come home.

18:01.481 --> 18:03.316
Thought you might want to know.

18:03.350 --> 18:04.617
(sighs)

18:11.524 --> 18:12.759
I'm sorry
about that.

18:12.792 --> 18:14.161
Oh, it's fine.

18:14.194 --> 18:16.629
Sometimes you just need
to empty the trash.

18:21.134 --> 18:25.438
* I'm on a new level *
Keep my birthday
turned up, hands up!

18:25.472 --> 18:27.106
* I'm on a new level... *
Hey.

18:27.140 --> 18:28.508
Happy birthday, Hakeem!

18:28.541 --> 18:32.011
(crowd cheers)

18:32.044 --> 18:33.846
* Chain with a new bezel... *

18:33.880 --> 18:36.749
What up, y'all?
Y'all followed the breadcrumbs,

18:36.783 --> 18:37.917
and y'all found us.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.519
We at Club Surrender.

18:39.552 --> 18:41.688
Big ups to Brooklyn,
top of the food chain.

18:41.721 --> 18:44.924
21 hours goes on and on, baby.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.159
PORSHA:
Hakeem!

18:46.193 --> 18:47.327
What?

18:47.360 --> 18:49.462
PORSHA: Get over here!
Hurry up!

18:49.496 --> 18:50.963
* Chain with a new bezel... *

18:50.997 --> 18:52.332
You not gonna
want to miss this.

18:52.365 --> 18:53.600
What's this?

18:53.633 --> 18:55.001
* Used to be sleeping
in itchy beds *

18:55.034 --> 18:56.969
* Bed bugs in the motel *

18:57.003 --> 18:58.104
* Now you're give me,
give me... *

18:58.137 --> 18:59.339
Surprise!

18:59.372 --> 19:00.507
Baby, what's up?

19:00.540 --> 19:02.875
Happy birthday.
Ah!

19:02.909 --> 19:05.044
PORSHA: Happy birthday, Hakeem!
(crowd cheers)

19:05.077 --> 19:06.179
Y'all see that, right?

19:06.213 --> 19:07.980
My baby came through.

19:08.014 --> 19:09.649
Sometimes you got to
surrender to love.

19:09.682 --> 19:11.184
(cheering)

19:11.218 --> 19:12.819
* First class from a old jail *

19:12.852 --> 19:15.722
* T Ferg did 15 in the feds... *

19:15.755 --> 19:18.625
How long we been here?
PORSHA:
15 minutes.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.527
All right, so let's get paid.
Baby, Kennedy, stay right here.

19:20.560 --> 19:22.161
I'll be right back, okay?

19:23.863 --> 19:25.998
Hey, happy birthday,
young buck.

19:26.032 --> 19:27.367
The house
is packed.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.135
Think you should
hang out a minute.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.137
The party don't stop for no man,
you know that.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.806
All right, well,
in that case...

19:33.840 --> 19:35.908
What's this?

19:35.942 --> 19:38.144
Your bill. You thought all
that champagne was free?

19:38.177 --> 19:41.047
That gets charged against
your appearance fee.

19:41.080 --> 19:42.382
Okay, that's not what
we talked about.

19:42.415 --> 19:43.850
Look, if your family showed up,

19:43.883 --> 19:45.318
Jamal, or your O.G. daddy...

19:45.352 --> 19:47.153
That wasn't the deal, man.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.888
Don't listen to him because
I'm here and so is Tiana.

19:48.921 --> 19:50.723
Maybe if you
freestyle rap

19:50.757 --> 19:53.426
a couple verses, I
could dig up five grand.

19:53.460 --> 19:56.028
Hakeem the Dream don't rap
for free, everybody know that.

19:56.062 --> 19:58.598
The deal was 50, man.
Where's my money?

19:58.631 --> 20:00.767
(chuckles)
And who's gonna back you?

20:00.800 --> 20:03.202
Your girl and
the ho squad?

20:03.236 --> 20:06.306
Okay, first of all, who the hell
you calling a ho?
Pay the man.

20:10.042 --> 20:11.278
Okay.

20:17.750 --> 20:18.951
Come on, man,

20:18.985 --> 20:20.453
I was messing...

20:21.921 --> 20:23.790
Let's get
the money out.

20:23.823 --> 20:25.358
Happy?

20:25.392 --> 20:27.960
My money. Yeah.

20:27.994 --> 20:30.763
Hey, I could use
another watch, man.

20:30.797 --> 20:32.399
East Coast,
West Coast.

20:32.432 --> 20:33.633
Run it, Shaq!

20:33.666 --> 20:35.935
Give him the watch.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.408
That's yours, man.
Hey.

20:41.441 --> 20:42.542
HAKEEM:
Congrats

20:42.575 --> 20:43.976
Perfect.
That's great.

20:44.010 --> 20:45.645
And I want to give you
a little something.

20:45.678 --> 20:47.380
There's your
little money

20:47.414 --> 20:48.581
for your little tips
for the champagne.

20:48.615 --> 20:50.450
Bounce!

20:50.483 --> 20:53.152
Hey, man, I don't know
who y'all are,

20:53.185 --> 20:54.487
but y'all can roll with us.

20:54.521 --> 20:55.755
Hey, thanks!

20:55.788 --> 20:57.156
It's good, let's go.
Yeah.

20:57.189 --> 20:58.157
Hey, we got
your back, y'all.

20:58.190 --> 20:59.659
Baby.

20:59.692 --> 21:00.960
Come on, let's go.

21:00.993 --> 21:02.228
Hey, yo.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.830
What's your name, bae?

21:03.863 --> 21:05.565
That's Kennedy, man.

21:05.598 --> 21:07.099
The party
just started.

21:07.133 --> 21:09.235
Choo-choo!
* Bought me a new shovel *

21:09.268 --> 21:11.604
Turn it up!
(laughter)

21:11.638 --> 21:13.072
On that train!

21:13.105 --> 21:15.342
* All my put in work. *

21:15.375 --> 21:17.209
(doorbell rings)

21:20.380 --> 21:21.781
Oh, Miss Anika.

21:21.814 --> 21:23.550
Hey, Juanita.
Hello.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.953
Is, uh, Lucious home?

21:26.986 --> 21:28.655
He'll be home
soon, Miss Anika.

21:28.688 --> 21:30.990
Right now, it's
just me and Bella.

21:31.023 --> 21:33.360
Oh, I can't wait
to see her.

21:36.463 --> 21:39.031
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

21:44.170 --> 21:45.505
Mama's here, baby.

21:47.674 --> 21:50.009
Mama is a dead
bitch walking.

21:50.042 --> 21:52.445
Where's my daughter?
Don't worry about
Bella, she's safe,

21:52.479 --> 21:55.314
which is more than I can
say for you right now.

21:55.348 --> 21:56.849
Cookie, I did not snitch on you.

21:56.883 --> 21:58.818
Tariq tried to talk to me,
and I ran.

21:58.851 --> 22:00.520
He doesn't even know I'm here.

22:00.553 --> 22:04.156
Look, I know you've been really
nice and helpful with me,

22:04.190 --> 22:06.325
but you've become
a huge problem.

22:06.359 --> 22:08.227
And I don't see
a reason why we shouldn't

22:08.260 --> 22:09.496
just kill you right now.

22:09.529 --> 22:11.163
What?

22:11.197 --> 22:12.732
Let me do it, Dwight.

22:12.765 --> 22:14.734
Mama, please,

22:14.767 --> 22:17.336
will you leave?
Please.

22:21.541 --> 22:23.943
Okay.

22:25.277 --> 22:27.680
You've got 30 seconds
to convince us

22:27.714 --> 22:29.348
why we should
let you live.

22:29.382 --> 22:30.717
Look, I didn't need
to be here right now.

22:30.750 --> 22:31.984
I could've gone
to Witness Protection

22:32.018 --> 22:33.319
and taken Bella with me.

22:33.352 --> 22:34.320
Well, why didn't you?

22:34.353 --> 22:35.555
Because I needed time

22:35.588 --> 22:36.989
to formulate a plan.

22:37.023 --> 22:38.391
And now I have one.

22:38.425 --> 22:41.160
I'm listening.

22:41.193 --> 22:43.996
We all know
that Tariq is jealous of you.

22:44.030 --> 22:45.998
We know that he wants
what you have.

22:46.032 --> 22:47.900
But he's only doing this
because he thinks

22:47.934 --> 22:49.736
that you stole his father.

22:49.769 --> 22:51.938
Dr. Freud, we figured this out
a long time ago.

22:51.971 --> 22:54.774
And what I've got,
he will never have.
Yes,

22:54.807 --> 22:56.876
but there's one thing that
he will take if you let him.

22:56.909 --> 22:58.445
Me.

22:58.478 --> 23:01.347
If we can prove that
Tariq and your wife

23:01.380 --> 23:03.916
have been... involved,

23:03.950 --> 23:07.554
they will be forced
to drop the case for good.

23:09.922 --> 23:11.791
She got to wear a wire.

23:11.824 --> 23:14.060
That's fine.
Just let me get his trust first.

23:14.093 --> 23:16.529
She's a lyin' snake.

23:16.563 --> 23:18.765
Tariq's too smart

23:18.798 --> 23:20.399
to fall for her.

23:21.434 --> 23:23.235
Let your mama do it.
Uh...

23:23.269 --> 23:24.403
Okay, Mama,

23:24.437 --> 23:26.739
give me the gun.

23:28.575 --> 23:31.110
Give it to me.

23:32.512 --> 23:34.481
Please.

23:40.487 --> 23:42.088
(exhaling):
Oh, my God...

23:42.121 --> 23:43.422
Where'd you get this?

23:43.456 --> 23:45.958
It was in her purse.

23:45.992 --> 23:48.895
Look, you gave it
to me, remember?

23:48.928 --> 23:51.297
It's none of your business.

23:51.330 --> 23:54.934
You're right.
None of my business.

23:54.967 --> 23:57.970
You got one week to figure out
a way to make your plan work,

23:58.004 --> 23:59.506
or I'm gonna
be forced to let

23:59.539 --> 24:01.440
my mama do
what she's been dying to do.

24:09.516 --> 24:11.818
I just feel like he turned
his whole life upside down,

24:11.851 --> 24:13.853
so the least I can do
is, I don't know,

24:13.886 --> 24:15.622
show him a little kindness.

24:15.655 --> 24:16.856
What does that mean?

24:16.889 --> 24:18.257
You're gonna do something
out of pity?

24:18.290 --> 24:20.092
No, of course not.

24:20.126 --> 24:22.094
It's kind of hard to explain.
You wouldn't understand.

24:22.128 --> 24:25.164
It's just... coming out in the
music business, it's like...

24:25.197 --> 24:28.100
It's a lot harder than it
would be in the military, right?

24:28.134 --> 24:30.503
(chuckling):
I'm sure.
(chuckles)

24:30.537 --> 24:33.673
Okay, you're right.
Maybe you do know something.

24:33.706 --> 24:35.307
(sighs)

24:36.643 --> 24:39.145
Look, what I do
know is that...

24:39.178 --> 24:42.448
what you and I have could
actually be really special.

24:42.481 --> 24:45.151
I'm not interested
in D-Major. I just...

24:45.184 --> 24:47.987
I just think that we could
show him a little compassion

24:48.020 --> 24:49.488
for what he's going through.

24:51.490 --> 24:53.626
I think you're right.

24:53.660 --> 24:56.062
I think we should.

25:03.502 --> 25:05.905
Thank you.

25:05.938 --> 25:07.674
I'm gonna go have the car
pull around front

25:07.707 --> 25:09.508
so we can surprise
your baby brother.

25:09.542 --> 25:10.843
Sounds good.

25:10.877 --> 25:12.444
All right.

25:37.870 --> 25:40.506
I'm sorry. Look,
I got scared and I ran.

25:40.539 --> 25:42.074
No, it's cool.

25:42.108 --> 25:44.010
You didn't tell Lucious, right?

25:44.043 --> 25:45.778
Hell no,
I didn't tell Lucious.

25:45.812 --> 25:47.446
I just told him
that my mom was sick

25:47.479 --> 25:49.381
and I left the baby
with Hakeem.

25:49.415 --> 25:52.051
I can't tell Lucious.
He'll kill me.
Yeah, see,

25:52.084 --> 25:53.620
that's what I'm talking about,
Anika.

25:53.653 --> 25:55.722
We need to do this
before anybody else gets killed.

25:55.755 --> 25:57.556
Look, Tariq,

25:57.590 --> 26:00.760
all I know is I don't want Bella
to be in the hands of strangers,

26:00.793 --> 26:02.695
you know? And I don't want
to look over my shoulder

26:02.729 --> 26:04.396
for the rest of my life.

26:06.565 --> 26:08.635
I don't know what to do.

26:08.668 --> 26:10.302
I'll protect you.

26:10.336 --> 26:11.871
Trust me.

26:11.904 --> 26:13.305
(vehicle approaching)

26:17.610 --> 26:19.545
All right.

26:19.578 --> 26:21.748
But, look,
only you.

26:21.781 --> 26:23.816
All right?
'Cause I-I...

26:23.850 --> 26:25.818
I don't want to do this
on my own.

26:27.920 --> 26:30.757
Tell you what,

26:30.790 --> 26:32.759
this is what we'll do.

26:32.792 --> 26:36.128
We'll give it a week to let it
get back to normal, all right?

26:36.162 --> 26:37.897
Then we'll try again.

26:37.930 --> 26:39.732
And forget Witness Protection.

26:39.766 --> 26:41.133
You'll be under my protection.

26:43.035 --> 26:45.037
I won't leave your side.

26:46.172 --> 26:47.606
Thank you.

26:53.212 --> 26:54.513
Hey.

26:54.546 --> 26:56.949
Good to see you, man.

26:59.218 --> 27:00.352
(beeps)

27:00.386 --> 27:02.288
Come on.

27:02.321 --> 27:04.490
(beeping)

27:04.523 --> 27:05.958
Miss, uh...

27:05.992 --> 27:10.429
Why is this not working?

27:10.462 --> 27:12.932
It's... It says D-Major
on there.

27:12.965 --> 27:14.333
Is there some kind of mistake?

27:14.366 --> 27:16.035
You see it says
D-Major? That's me.

27:17.303 --> 27:18.604
(sighs)

27:18.637 --> 27:20.339
Do me a favor and call Jamal.

27:20.372 --> 27:22.174
Hey, man, come on.
You don't want to be doing this.

27:22.208 --> 27:23.542
Why don't you just go home?

27:23.575 --> 27:26.979
You don't know
what I want to be doing.

27:27.013 --> 27:29.181
Yeah, I do. We both do.

27:29.215 --> 27:31.650
We know exactly what
you're going through, man.

27:31.684 --> 27:33.019
We know where
you're coming from.

27:33.052 --> 27:35.154
(chuckles)
You keep saying "we."

27:35.187 --> 27:37.523
Like you and Jamal
got something real.

27:37.556 --> 27:39.191
I just want you to understand
what's going on, man,

27:39.225 --> 27:40.459
it'd make this a lot easier.

27:40.492 --> 27:42.328
All right?

27:44.430 --> 27:46.733
Oh, I understand
what's going on.

27:46.766 --> 27:50.369
The thing is, Philip,
no matter how hard you try,

27:50.402 --> 27:53.139
you won't never, ever be able
to give it to him the way I do.

27:53.172 --> 27:55.708
Okay, shorty?
Get off of me, man.

27:55.742 --> 27:58.310
Yo, Philip. Come on,
what's your problem?

27:58.344 --> 28:00.880
Still had that one coming, man.

28:05.684 --> 28:07.519
D-MAJOR:
Hey, Jamal...

28:15.762 --> 28:18.030
* Work, work, work, work, work,
work, he said me haffi work *

28:18.064 --> 28:21.734
* Work, work, work, work, work!
He see me do mi dirt, dirt *

28:21.768 --> 28:23.102
* Dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt!
And so me put in... *

28:23.135 --> 28:24.603
I said drip!

28:24.636 --> 28:25.938
ALL:
Drop!

28:25.972 --> 28:27.439
Drip!
Drop!

28:27.473 --> 28:29.075
Hey, look,
y'all already know the spot

28:29.108 --> 28:30.542
on the next tour.

28:30.576 --> 28:32.879
It's Laviticus.
(whoops)

28:32.912 --> 28:34.680
(whooping, applause)
Ain't no place like home, right?

28:34.713 --> 28:36.082
ALL:
Yeah!

28:36.115 --> 28:37.784
Happy birthday!
Get that money!

28:37.817 --> 28:39.518
You know what I'm saying?
Throw that money up.

28:39.551 --> 28:41.353
* Work, work, work,
work, work, work, work... *

28:41.387 --> 28:43.022
Yeah. Money for everybody.

28:43.055 --> 28:44.857
* And so me put in work *

28:44.891 --> 28:46.725
* Work, work, work,
work, work. *

28:46.759 --> 28:49.161
(dramatic music plays)

28:55.234 --> 28:56.936
What's this?

28:59.438 --> 29:02.308
(cheering, applause)

29:07.313 --> 29:09.081
Happy birthday, baby!

29:10.316 --> 29:11.383
We're official.

29:11.417 --> 29:13.853
* One, two, three *

29:22.929 --> 29:25.731
* I want you all mine *

29:25.764 --> 29:28.667
* I'll give you all the signs *

29:28.700 --> 29:30.602
* I know that I took my time *

29:30.636 --> 29:32.738
* But I made up my mind *

29:32.771 --> 29:37.509
* Oh, baby, you know
you make me feel *

29:37.543 --> 29:39.278
* Something that I never had *

29:39.311 --> 29:42.448
* You let me know it's real *

29:42.481 --> 29:44.683
* Can't nobody make me feel
the way that you do *

29:44.716 --> 29:46.752
* When you 'round me I can't
take my eyes off of you, ooh *

29:46.785 --> 29:48.654
* I can see you're 'bout it,
love the way that you move *

29:48.687 --> 29:52.024
* Tellin' you you got it
and you know it's the truth *

29:52.058 --> 29:56.328
* I feel so alive when I got you
right here by my side *

29:56.362 --> 29:57.830
* That's 'cause
when I'm with you *

29:57.864 --> 29:59.698
* You know everything
is all right *

30:01.500 --> 30:03.335
* Yeah *
* Don't worry, I got you *

30:03.369 --> 30:05.938
* Yeah *
* Don't worry, I got you *

30:05.972 --> 30:07.874
* Yeah *
* Don't worry, I got you *

30:07.907 --> 30:09.976
Happy birthday, brother,
I love you.
* Don't worry *

30:10.009 --> 30:13.012
* I got you *
* Don't worry you got it *

30:13.045 --> 30:16.782
* I got it, too,
so just imagine what we *

30:16.815 --> 30:19.818
* What we could be together *

30:19.852 --> 30:22.221
* Always want to give you
my loving *

30:22.254 --> 30:23.822
You think we gonna forget
our baby brother?
* Always wanted to make you... *

30:23.856 --> 30:25.157
Hey, what's up, bro?

30:25.191 --> 30:27.026
Happy birthday, Hakeem.
Where's my gift?

30:27.059 --> 30:28.627
Hmm?
It's in the mail.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.062
It's in the mail?
You know I'm good for it.

30:30.096 --> 30:31.497
(both laugh)

30:31.530 --> 30:32.664
Hey, it's your night. All right?

30:32.698 --> 30:33.832
All right.

30:33.866 --> 30:35.367
* Anything you need, yeah *

30:35.401 --> 30:37.469
* You can count on me *

30:37.503 --> 30:39.071
* Yeah yeah *
* Don't worry *

30:39.105 --> 30:42.308
* Don't worry *
* 'Cause I got you *

30:42.341 --> 30:44.977
* Anything you need *

30:45.011 --> 30:47.746
* You can call on me,
yeah, yeah *
* Yo, ha, ha, yeah, yo, yo, yo *

30:47.779 --> 30:49.748
* I hold you down
like it's nothin' *

30:49.781 --> 30:51.650
* 'Cause I need your lovin', I'd
rather have you by my side *

30:51.683 --> 30:53.920
* Than them chicks clubbing,
you see them bankrolls *

30:53.953 --> 30:56.488
* I'll spend them on you,
and I'll always keep it real *

30:56.522 --> 30:59.225
* No pretending on you, I'm just
trying put you under my arm *

30:59.258 --> 31:00.526
* And make you wifey,
take you round the world *

31:00.559 --> 31:02.428
* Anywhere you want
to sightsee... *

31:02.461 --> 31:04.931
Hey, I'm 'bout to go holler
at this shorty. Watch me.

31:04.964 --> 31:07.266
* I'm just trying to change
the last name on your ID *

31:07.299 --> 31:08.901
No thanks.
* I'd pay the cost
for you baby *

31:08.935 --> 31:11.437
I seen you all night, girl.
I know you seen me, too.

31:11.470 --> 31:13.105
Just you give me
a little smile.

31:13.139 --> 31:15.207
What part of "no"
don't you understand?

31:15.241 --> 31:16.842
WOMAN: Look,
let go of her!

31:16.875 --> 31:18.844
Push off, bro. You too strong.

31:18.877 --> 31:19.912
Hey, yo. Leave her alone, man.

31:19.946 --> 31:21.580
WOMAN: Get your
hands off her.

31:21.613 --> 31:22.614
Oh, who do you think
you're talking to?

31:22.648 --> 31:23.916
(crowd gasping)

31:23.950 --> 31:25.584
Kennedy!

31:25.617 --> 31:26.718
Ratchet-ass bitch.

31:26.752 --> 31:29.555
(screaming)

31:30.756 --> 31:32.024
Get off!

31:32.058 --> 31:33.259
Yo.

31:33.292 --> 31:34.726
(grunts)

31:34.760 --> 31:36.095
Stop it!

31:36.128 --> 31:38.130
Marcel, go get
Andre now!

31:38.164 --> 31:39.431
Yah-ha!

31:40.832 --> 31:41.833
Dance for Hakeem!

31:44.236 --> 31:46.872
Yeah!
Keem, now just stay back!

31:46.905 --> 31:48.407
(excited chatter)

31:48.440 --> 31:49.875
(grunts, glass shatters)

31:49.908 --> 31:52.278
(crowd shouting)

31:52.311 --> 31:53.645
Oh!

31:53.679 --> 31:55.047
Hey, hey, hey!

31:55.081 --> 31:57.083
Let me go!
Let me go!

31:57.116 --> 31:58.284
Let him go now!

31:58.317 --> 32:00.119
Yo! What's up?

32:00.152 --> 32:01.687
PORSHA:
Y'all some bitches!

32:05.657 --> 32:07.893
(siren wailing in distance)

32:07.926 --> 32:10.496
(indistinct radio chatter)

32:14.200 --> 32:15.467
This is crazy.

32:15.501 --> 32:17.269
You all right?

32:19.271 --> 32:22.141
I just talked to the men I sent
to ride shotgun on your ass.

32:22.174 --> 32:24.643
They said you cut them loose.

32:24.676 --> 32:26.012
I thought they were
Shine's boys,

32:26.045 --> 32:27.579
and you sent them
to mess my b-day up.

32:27.613 --> 32:29.481
Why would I do that, Hakeem?

32:29.515 --> 32:31.917
Let me think.
'Cause you always do that.

32:31.950 --> 32:33.119
Whatever.
Listen, first of all,

32:33.152 --> 32:34.686
it wasn't done on purpose.

32:34.720 --> 32:36.422
It's never on purpose with him.
He's never been held

32:36.455 --> 32:38.524
to the same standard
as you and me,

32:38.557 --> 32:40.692
'cause he's the baby, right?
Stop that.

32:40.726 --> 32:43.195
It's his birthday right now,
so we'll deal with it tomorrow.

32:43.229 --> 32:44.496
No, did you know that he hired

32:44.530 --> 32:46.298
two random dudes
to act like his security?

32:46.332 --> 32:48.434
Oh, God. I didn't hire nobody.
They said he gave them cash,

32:48.467 --> 32:51.037
champagne, watches, in
exchange for their services.

32:51.070 --> 32:52.538
Now, in the eyes
of the law, that makes them

32:52.571 --> 32:54.340
de facto employees
of Empire, Jamal.

32:54.373 --> 32:56.375
Well, stop talking about me
like I'm not standing here.

32:56.408 --> 32:57.709
I made a mistake.

32:57.743 --> 32:58.944
What was I supposed to do?

32:58.977 --> 33:00.779
In an Empire venue.

33:00.812 --> 33:02.148
On company property.

33:02.181 --> 33:04.616
Do you have any idea,
the liability?

33:04.650 --> 33:06.385
Ain't you supposed
to be a father?
Calm down,

33:06.418 --> 33:09.021
people watching.
You just mad 'cause Dad
had my back on this.

33:09.055 --> 33:11.023
See, he understands me.

33:11.057 --> 33:12.558
Him and me got something
you will never have,

33:12.591 --> 33:14.193
and that's music.
Oh, shut up, Hakeem,

33:14.226 --> 33:15.861
just shut up.
You know I don't know
nothing about liability.

33:15.894 --> 33:16.962
That's because you are
the liability,

33:16.995 --> 33:18.164
Hakeem!
Dre, chill.

33:18.197 --> 33:20.199
For this family
and for this company.

33:20.232 --> 33:22.134
Stop spitting in my face.

33:22.168 --> 33:24.203
You know what?

33:24.236 --> 33:26.405
You are 21 years old now.

33:26.438 --> 33:27.639
Yup.

33:27.673 --> 33:29.741
You a man.
I'm a man.

33:29.775 --> 33:31.510
You gonna learn
to take responsibilities

33:31.543 --> 33:33.045
for your actions like a man.

33:33.079 --> 33:35.381
Like a man.
So, as of this minute,

33:35.414 --> 33:36.915
your channel is shut down.

33:36.948 --> 33:38.717
You are off of Empire XStream
for good.

33:39.951 --> 33:41.853
Happy birthday.

33:43.021 --> 33:44.656
Yo, Dre, stop
playing with me.

33:44.690 --> 33:45.957
Give me my camera, man.

33:54.733 --> 33:58.437
What's his problem, man?
Dre always bugging.

33:58.470 --> 34:00.439
Why don't you calm
your ass down?
Yeah, okay, man.

34:00.472 --> 34:03.909
And it is mostly your
fault, Hakeem, it is.
How?

34:03.942 --> 34:05.277
Come here, baby.

34:05.311 --> 34:07.413
Look, it was all so dope
at first, right?

34:07.446 --> 34:09.448
And then my party
just got ruined.

34:09.481 --> 34:11.283
Seriously?

34:11.317 --> 34:13.219
Seriously.
My night just got ruined.

34:13.252 --> 34:14.620
What about my friend's
night, Hakeem?

34:14.653 --> 34:16.788
You haven't even asked
about Kennedy.

34:16.822 --> 34:18.424
Okay, I was about to ask you.
Is she okay?

34:18.457 --> 34:19.891
She's in the hospital,

34:19.925 --> 34:21.026
and that's where
I'm going right now.

34:21.059 --> 34:22.461
All right,
we coming with you.

34:22.494 --> 34:24.430
Nah, don't bother.

34:24.463 --> 34:26.031
Just keep making it
about you, Hakeem.

34:26.064 --> 34:27.366
It's what you do best.

34:27.399 --> 34:28.634
Baby.

34:28.667 --> 34:30.136
* You fluid
with the foolishness *

34:30.169 --> 34:31.737
* You just like H2O,
without the two in it... *

34:31.770 --> 34:33.439
Now her, too?

34:33.472 --> 34:37.876
Brah, this has been the worst
birthday party of my life, man.

34:37.909 --> 34:40.646
* Gotta watch my back,
might get jacked *

34:40.679 --> 34:42.714
* Make the wrong move,
I just might get capped *

34:42.748 --> 34:44.816
* Bump that,
I'm on a killin' spree *

34:44.850 --> 34:46.118
* I gotta keep
the flow tight... *

34:46.152 --> 34:49.087
You know why it's your fault?

34:49.121 --> 34:51.056
Because of lyrics like this.

34:51.089 --> 34:52.824
Can you hear 'em?

34:52.858 --> 34:54.426
This is you.

34:54.460 --> 34:56.328
Time to become a man, brother.

34:56.362 --> 34:57.929
* Middle finger to a chick *

34:57.963 --> 34:59.398
I am a man.
* Whoever sabotage a man... *

34:59.431 --> 35:00.732
I am a man.

35:00.766 --> 35:01.833
* Ya'll goin' learn today *

35:01.867 --> 35:03.169
* Go to hell with gasoline... *

35:03.202 --> 35:04.436
There's a car
waiting for you

35:04.470 --> 35:07.339
by the side entrance
to take you home.

35:07.373 --> 35:09.074
I'm not going home.
I'm going to get my girl.

35:09.107 --> 35:11.109
Let's go.

35:11.143 --> 35:12.811
* I don't, I don't trust 'em,
I don't, I don't *

35:12.844 --> 35:15.947
* I don't trust 'em, no, no. *

35:15.981 --> 35:17.983
(low-key jazz playing)

35:24.122 --> 35:25.257
Mm.

35:25.291 --> 35:27.025
Mm, mm, mm.

35:27.058 --> 35:28.594
(chuckles)

35:28.627 --> 35:29.961
Did you just moan?

35:29.995 --> 35:31.096
Did you just like it?

35:31.129 --> 35:32.864
Well, I'm not complaining.

35:32.898 --> 35:35.867
Bourbon, rocks.

35:36.868 --> 35:38.804
You ready to talk business?

35:38.837 --> 35:41.473
I took the liberty
of drafting a contract.

35:41.507 --> 35:43.108
I think we should get
to know each other first.

35:43.141 --> 35:47.479
Okay. You want to get
to know me here or...

35:48.747 --> 35:50.549
...you want to get to know me
somewhere else?

35:53.151 --> 35:55.487
I want to finish my drink.
Oh.

35:55.521 --> 35:57.923
Yeah.
Okay, okay.

35:59.325 --> 36:01.593
So, what do you want
to know about me?

36:05.197 --> 36:06.965
Are you close to your father?

36:06.998 --> 36:08.334
Very.

36:11.703 --> 36:15.073
Then how come you haven't
brought him to see me?

36:15.106 --> 36:16.808
I want to negotiate
our deal first.

36:16.842 --> 36:18.244
And then

36:18.277 --> 36:19.478
I'll make him

36:19.511 --> 36:21.347
an offer he can't refuse.

36:21.380 --> 36:23.549
Why don't we go back
to your hotel?

36:23.582 --> 36:25.251
Does your lady know you're here?

36:25.284 --> 36:27.519
She knows I'm trying
to close a very big deal...

36:27.553 --> 36:29.988
Mm-hmm.
...with all kinds of...

36:30.021 --> 36:31.790
opportunities for her.

36:33.592 --> 36:36.161
That's not
good enough, Andre.

36:36.194 --> 36:39.565
You see, I don't ever touch
another woman's man.

36:39.598 --> 36:42.033
At least, not without
her permission.

36:42.067 --> 36:45.170
This is how I do business,
Giuliana.

36:45.203 --> 36:48.206
It's how I've always
done business.

36:49.708 --> 36:52.544
Nessa's fine with it.

36:52.578 --> 36:54.212
So, you have an agreement?

36:58.650 --> 37:00.719
We do.

37:00.752 --> 37:02.954
Well, I like it.

37:02.988 --> 37:04.290
So, I'm gonna have my people

37:04.323 --> 37:06.057
look at the terms
of the contract,

37:06.091 --> 37:09.395
and if I like what I read,
then you and I can do business.

37:09.428 --> 37:10.462
Sounds fair.

37:10.496 --> 37:11.930
Good.

37:11.963 --> 37:14.199
Now, if you'll excuse me.

37:14.232 --> 37:17.068
* Yeah, you and me fight
like animals... *

37:17.102 --> 37:20.606
Are you gonna let me out?

37:20.639 --> 37:22.073
Or should I climb over you?

37:23.842 --> 37:29.214
* Yeah, you and me fight
like animals *

37:29.247 --> 37:31.983
* Yeah, you and me love
like savages. *

37:36.855 --> 37:39.925
You had them high-society folks
eating out of your hand.

37:39.958 --> 37:41.460
Even your mother.

37:41.493 --> 37:42.828
Yeah, well,
especially my mother.

37:42.861 --> 37:43.929
(chuckles)

37:43.962 --> 37:45.964
(Angelo chuckles)

37:45.997 --> 37:47.899
(under breath):
All right.

37:47.933 --> 37:50.235
Mm, mm.
I need you
to do me a favor.

37:50.268 --> 37:52.938
Ooh. That depends.

37:53.972 --> 37:56.642
I was gonna turn this in myself,

37:56.675 --> 38:00.812
but then I realized just having
this in my possession

38:00.846 --> 38:04.483
is a major violation.
Mm.

38:04.516 --> 38:06.418
Okay.

38:06.452 --> 38:09.455
Well, I'll take
care of it for you.

38:09.488 --> 38:10.856
Okay.

38:13.825 --> 38:16.261
(moans)

38:16.294 --> 38:17.663
Come on.
Yes, ma'am.

38:17.696 --> 38:20.265
Yes. (giggles)

38:20.298 --> 38:23.669
("Trance" by Lili Ray playing)

38:25.671 --> 38:29.375
* You see what
you're doing to me... *

38:32.243 --> 38:36.181
What's taking so
long, Giuliana?

38:36.214 --> 38:38.984
I told you I needed
a little time to work my magic.

38:39.017 --> 38:41.319
I'm tired of your crap.

38:41.353 --> 38:42.988
Where's Rafael?

38:43.021 --> 38:44.990
Rafael was skimming
from you, Gino.

38:46.257 --> 38:47.726
I got rid of the problem.

38:47.759 --> 38:50.496
* Watch me have you
in a trance *

38:50.529 --> 38:55.734
* Gonna have you
in the palm of my hands... *

38:55.767 --> 38:57.235
GIULIANA: Every dollar
my husband skimmed.

38:57.268 --> 38:59.037
A gift from me to you.

38:59.070 --> 39:00.572
Another one
of your magic tricks?

39:00.606 --> 39:02.541
Trying to get Rafi
off the hook?

39:03.575 --> 39:04.910
Maybe you're the problem

39:04.943 --> 39:06.244
I need to get rid of.

39:06.277 --> 39:07.879
Well, if you do that,

39:07.913 --> 39:10.849
you'll never be in business
with Lucious Lyon.

39:12.751 --> 39:14.820
* Watch me have you... *

39:14.853 --> 39:18.089
Paid in Cash was the first CD
I ever boosted...

39:18.123 --> 39:19.925
and my mother beat my ass,

39:19.958 --> 39:22.394
but, uh, I must've listened
to that thing a thousand times.

39:23.529 --> 39:24.930
I've been trying to get

39:24.963 --> 39:26.765
to Lucious Lyon a long time.

39:26.798 --> 39:32.003
I know, and you can't touch him,
but I can.

39:32.037 --> 39:35.607
* Why would you do this to me? *

39:35.641 --> 39:38.710
* Why? Whoa-oh-oh... *
* Why would you
do this to me? *

39:38.744 --> 39:40.278
Do your thing.

39:40.311 --> 39:42.213
Make me believe in magic.

39:42.247 --> 39:44.616
Oh, you know I have tricks.

39:44.650 --> 39:47.118
* Gonna have you in the palm *

39:47.152 --> 39:50.622
* Of my hands. *

39:52.157 --> 39:53.892
(knocking on door)

39:53.925 --> 39:57.729
Who the hell is knocking
on my damn door this late?

39:57.763 --> 40:01.032
Are you out of your damn mind
banging on my door at this hour?

40:01.066 --> 40:02.400
I'm here for my girl.

40:10.776 --> 40:12.478
It's time to go, baby.

40:12.511 --> 40:14.513
(Bella cooing)

40:19.017 --> 40:21.720
LUCIOUS:
Hakeem.

40:21.753 --> 40:24.656
Where do you think you're taking
the baby this hour of the night?

40:24.690 --> 40:26.391
It's still my birthday,

40:26.424 --> 40:27.926
so I'm spending what's
left of it with Bella.

40:31.997 --> 40:33.799
Why don't you, um,
have a seat for a minute

40:33.832 --> 40:35.767
and let me talk to you?
Why?

40:35.801 --> 40:37.268
So you can tell me I can't?

40:37.302 --> 40:38.436
No, so I could tell you

40:38.470 --> 40:40.806
that I've waited 21 years

40:40.839 --> 40:43.408
to hear you say
what you just said.

40:43.441 --> 40:45.611
Come on. It'll just
take a minute.

40:53.218 --> 40:55.887
Scoot over, man,
give me some room.

40:57.856 --> 41:00.692
You know,
the night you were born,

41:00.726 --> 41:03.428
the heavens were
in an uproar...

41:03.461 --> 41:05.964
raining cats and dogs.

41:05.997 --> 41:09.434
Your mama just started
having contractions,

41:09.467 --> 41:12.103
but seeing this wasn't
our first go-around,

41:12.137 --> 41:13.939
you know, we didn't
rush to the hospital

41:13.972 --> 41:15.440
or nothing like that.

41:15.473 --> 41:18.109
Your mama actually was hungry
for some Chinese food,

41:18.143 --> 41:21.446
so I break down to the little
corner Chinese spot

41:21.479 --> 41:23.882
while your mom
called Aunt Carol

41:23.915 --> 41:26.351
so that she could
watch your brothers.

41:26.384 --> 41:28.119
Anyway, I don't know
whether it was

41:28.153 --> 41:33.058
the Kung Pao
or the lightning,

41:33.091 --> 41:35.493
but your mama's water broke.

41:37.395 --> 41:39.497
We never made it
to the hospital that night.

41:39.531 --> 41:41.032
I was born at home?

41:41.066 --> 41:42.534
I delivered you

41:42.568 --> 41:45.203
with your Aunt Carol
as a midwife.

41:45.236 --> 41:46.705
(clears throat)

41:46.738 --> 41:50.041
But the point I'm making is

41:50.075 --> 41:53.078
you were in such a rush
to come into this world,

41:53.111 --> 41:55.847
and you've been
in a mad hurry ever since.

41:57.382 --> 41:59.484
You're my youngest...

41:59.517 --> 42:03.488
so I suppose I've indulged you
a bit more than I should have,

42:03.521 --> 42:05.356
probably to your detriment.

42:05.390 --> 42:07.759
Nature never rushes,

42:07.793 --> 42:11.229
and yet she accomplishes
the entire universe.

42:11.262 --> 42:13.198
You've said something
tonight, though,

42:13.231 --> 42:16.868
that let me know that you
have your priorities right.

42:16.902 --> 42:18.670
You're a man now...

42:18.704 --> 42:22.908
but on top of that...
you're a Lyon.

42:25.043 --> 42:26.544
Hello, princess.

42:26.578 --> 42:28.580
(Lucious chuckling)

42:31.482 --> 42:34.519
A Lyon always looks
after his responsibility

42:34.552 --> 42:35.954
above anything else.

42:37.488 --> 42:39.524
You got to protect this angel

42:39.557 --> 42:41.960
with your very life.

42:47.165 --> 42:48.767
Go to your daddy.

42:49.801 --> 42:52.070
(chuckles)

42:52.103 --> 42:56.574
Go to your daddy with that
crazy old jacket on.

42:56.608 --> 42:59.477
I will.

43:02.948 --> 43:04.916
Hey, son.

43:11.589 --> 43:15.126
Happy birthday.

43:59.838 --> 44:01.006
Yeah.

44:01.039 --> 44:03.008
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

44:05.576 --> 44:07.278
ANNOUNCER: You've just
watched Empire.

44:07.312 --> 44:10.048
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:11.316 --> 44:13.051
(gunshot)

44:13.084 --> 44:15.353
Shots Fired is
a murder mystery.

44:15.386 --> 44:18.189
An African-American officer
kills an unarmed white guy.

44:18.223 --> 44:20.959
I asked him
to step out of the vehicle,
but as he steps out,

44:20.992 --> 44:23.194
he reaches for my gun,
and it was either him or me.

44:23.228 --> 44:24.696
-And I shot him.
-Four times.

44:26.231 --> 44:28.800
WOMAN: Preston and Ashe are
a prosecutor and an investigator

44:28.834 --> 44:30.568
come down to investigate.

44:30.601 --> 44:33.671
They uncover a second teenager
that was killed-- a black teen.

44:33.705 --> 44:37.208
Suddenly, there's these two
racially charged shootings
they're investigating.

44:37.242 --> 44:40.078
I play Ashe Akino.
She has lots of layers.

44:40.111 --> 44:42.213
She is not perfect.

44:42.247 --> 44:44.249
Sometimes she will do
whatever it takes

44:44.282 --> 44:46.417
to get what she wants
in a case.

44:46.451 --> 44:49.821
Preston's a graduate
from Harvard, working for
the Department of Justice.

44:49.855 --> 44:53.759
As the series progresses,
his idealism will be tested.

44:53.792 --> 44:56.527
All I care about is the truth,
and my truth has no color.

44:56.561 --> 44:59.097
A tragedy has come
to Gate Station,

44:59.130 --> 45:01.399
and when there are questions,
I want answers.

45:01.432 --> 45:04.335
Our mantra for the show
is get the audience
at the edge of their seat,

45:04.369 --> 45:06.137
and when they're
leaning forward,
hit 'em with the truth.
