WEBVTT

01:05.190 --> 01:07.650
FOLKS, CONGRATULATIONS
ARE IN ORDER.

01:07.734 --> 01:09.652
I JUST MADE IT THROUGH
ANOTHER WEEK OF WORK

01:09.736 --> 01:10.820
WITHOUT MY BROTHER CANNING ME.

01:10.904 --> 01:14.532
WHO'S UP FOR A CELEBRATION?

01:14.616 --> 01:15.825
HEY, HELEN.

01:15.909 --> 01:17.160
POP ON YOUR PINK DRESS.

01:17.243 --> 01:18.995
I'LL GRAB MY LOINCLOTH.

01:19.078 --> 01:21.664
WE'LL HAVE A DATE
THAT WILL LIVE IN INFAMY.

01:21.748 --> 01:23.666
DATE?

01:23.750 --> 01:25.335
YOU'VE SEEN THEM ON T.V.

01:25.418 --> 01:27.796
NOW HAVE ONE OF YOUR VERY OWN.

01:27.879 --> 01:29.005
I CAN'T, BRIAN.

01:29.088 --> 01:30.882
I HAVE TO PRACTICE.

01:30.965 --> 01:32.926
{\an1}GREAT, WE'LL HAVE
A SCRIMMAGE.

01:33.009 --> 01:34.928
{\an1}I'LL BE SHIRTS,
YOU BE SKINS.

01:35.011 --> 01:35.970
I MEANT MY CELLO.

01:36.054 --> 01:38.139
BESIDES, I HAVE THIS RULE.

01:38.223 --> 01:39.390
I DON'T DATE PILOTS.

01:39.474 --> 01:40.850
YOU'RE KIDDING. WHY?

01:40.934 --> 01:43.311
I'VE BEEN AROUND PILOTS
ALL MY LIFE.

01:43.394 --> 01:44.521
THEY ARE ARROGANT

01:44.604 --> 01:47.357
SELF-CENTERED,
AND JUST TOO DAMN COCKY.

01:47.440 --> 01:51.694
{\an1}BUT YOU'LL BREAK THAT RULE
FOR ME, RIGHT, BABE?

01:51.778 --> 01:53.696
WAS THAT YOU BEING CHARMING?

01:53.780 --> 01:55.406
I GAGGED AND MISSED IT.

01:57.158 --> 01:59.077
DOESN'T DATE PILOTS.

01:59.160 --> 02:01.079
THAT'S WHY I <i> BECAME</i> A PILOT.

02:01.162 --> 02:03.206
LOWELL, HOW ABOUT
GOING OUT

02:03.289 --> 02:04.916
AND HAVING
A COUPLE OF BEERS?

02:04.999 --> 02:06.543
WIFE CALLED.

02:06.626 --> 02:09.169
{\an1}GOT TWO INCHES OF WATER
IN THE LIVING ROOM.

02:09.253 --> 02:10.713
IS YOUR ROOF LEAKING?

02:10.797 --> 02:13.675
NO, IT'S THE FLOOR.

02:13.758 --> 02:15.510
I LIVE ON A BOAT.

02:17.262 --> 02:19.013
HEY, FAY,
HOW ABOUT YOU?

02:19.097 --> 02:20.849
GOT ANY PLANS
FOR TONIGHT?

02:20.932 --> 02:24.519
YES, THIS IS THE NIGHT
I THAW OUT FOOD FOR THE WEEKEND.

02:24.602 --> 02:26.896
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

02:26.980 --> 02:28.356
NIGHT, HACKETT.

02:28.439 --> 02:30.066
NIGHT... HEY, ROY.

02:30.149 --> 02:33.069
{\an1}HOW ABOUT
YOU AND ME...

02:33.152 --> 02:35.321
NIGHT, ROY.

02:37.490 --> 02:39.909
YO, JOEY.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.286
IT'S QUITTING TIME.

02:41.369 --> 02:43.246
WHAT SAY WE GO
GET A COUPLE BEERS

02:43.329 --> 02:45.081
AND SCOPE OUT
THE CHICKAGE?

02:45.164 --> 02:46.499
CHICKAGE?

02:46.583 --> 02:47.917
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
CHICKS.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.461
DAMES, BABES, BROADS,
SKIRTS, HONEYS...

02:50.545 --> 02:52.714
OKAY, OKAY, I GET IT.

02:52.797 --> 02:54.090
ARE YOU SURE?

02:54.173 --> 02:56.926
BECAUSE I KNOW AT LEAST
38 DIFFERENT EUPHEMISMS.

02:57.010 --> 03:00.096
YOU MUST BE VERY PROUD.

03:00.179 --> 03:01.931
I'LL TAKE A RAIN CHECK.

03:02.015 --> 03:02.974
LET'S GO OUT.

03:03.057 --> 03:04.392
LET'S HAVE A GOOD TIME.

03:04.475 --> 03:06.227
{\an3}I'M HAVING
A GOOD TIME.

03:06.311 --> 03:08.438
{\an1}YOU'RE WIPING OIL
OFF AN ENGINE.

03:08.521 --> 03:10.940
LOOK, REMEMBER
YOUR FIRST SCHWINN?

03:11.024 --> 03:13.151
YO, MAGIC, HEADS UP.

03:13.234 --> 03:16.154
YOU LOVED THAT BIKE SO MUCH
YOU SLEPT WITH IT.

03:16.237 --> 03:18.072
THAT'S HOW I FEEL
ABOUT THIS.

03:18.156 --> 03:21.367
{\an3}FOR GOD'S SAKE, I'VE GOT
MY OWN PLANE, BRIAN.

03:24.829 --> 03:26.372
HIT ME!

03:28.458 --> 03:31.085
I'M OPEN!

03:31.169 --> 03:33.129
{\an1}YOU KNOW,
NO OFFENSE, JOE

03:33.212 --> 03:35.673
{\an1}BUT THIS IS THE WORST GAME
OF ONE-ON-ONE

03:35.757 --> 03:37.133
I'VE EVER PLAYED.

03:37.216 --> 03:39.552
LET'S GO FIND SOME WOMEN.

03:39.636 --> 03:43.973
{\an3}YOU DO DATE,
DON'T YOU?

03:44.057 --> 03:45.141
OF COURSE I DATE.

03:45.224 --> 03:46.935
DO YOU THINK I'M A HERMIT?

03:47.018 --> 03:48.478
I WENT ON A DATE LAST...

03:48.561 --> 03:49.646
WHAT MONTH IS THIS?

03:49.729 --> 03:50.647
APRIL.

03:50.730 --> 03:52.273
APRIL?

03:52.357 --> 03:53.274
REALLY?

03:53.358 --> 03:54.984
I'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.110
THAT A BOY, JOE.

03:57.946 --> 04:01.491
"SOCIAL LIFE."

04:01.574 --> 04:04.994
WHAT DID YOU DO FOR FUN
WHILE I WAS GONE?

04:05.078 --> 04:07.997
{\an1}ACTUALLY, YOU BEING GONE
WAS PRETTY FUN.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.999
{\an3}I KNOW WHAT I AM
GOING TO DO.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.417
I'M GOING TO TAKE IT

04:11.501 --> 04:13.962
UPON MYSELF TO FIND YOU
THE PERFECT WOMAN.

04:14.045 --> 04:15.838
I'LL MAKE YOU MY PROJECT.

04:15.922 --> 04:18.841
THE LAST TIME,
I HAD TO GO TO COURT.

04:18.925 --> 04:20.468
OH, YEAH.

04:20.551 --> 04:23.346
THANKS A LOT,
MR. WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION.

04:23.429 --> 04:25.181
I CAN FIND MY OWN DATES.

04:25.264 --> 04:28.351
{\an1}JOE, YOU CAN'T EVEN PLAY
A GAME OF ONE-ON-ONE.

04:28.434 --> 04:30.812
{\an1}HOW ARE YOU GOING
TO PLAY ONE-ON-ONE?

04:35.984 --> 04:37.694
GAME TO 11, $100.

04:40.238 --> 04:43.032
I'VE GOT THE WHOLE GANG
WAITING OUTSIDE FOR ME.

04:47.954 --> 04:51.207
WHEN DOES THE NEXT FLIGHT
FROM BOSTON ARRIVE?

04:51.290 --> 04:54.293
{\an1}THERE'S AN AEROMASS FLIGHT
DUE IN SOON.

04:54.377 --> 04:56.379
ARE YOU MEETING SOMEONE?

04:56.462 --> 04:57.714
MY SON.

04:57.797 --> 04:59.048
HE'S IN THE ARMY.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.551
HOW NICE FOR YOU.

05:01.634 --> 05:04.387
{\an1}MY SECOND HUSBAND, GEORGE,
WAS IN THE ARMY.

05:04.470 --> 05:07.223
{\an1}OR WAS THAT
MY FIRST HUSBAND, GEORGE?

05:07.306 --> 05:09.767
{\an3}YOU HAD TWO HUSBANDS
NAMED GEORGE?

05:09.851 --> 05:10.852
THREE, ACTUALLY.

05:10.935 --> 05:14.522
BURIED THEM ALL.

05:14.605 --> 05:16.357
THAT'S RATHER UNUSUAL.

05:16.441 --> 05:18.067
NOT REALLY.

05:18.151 --> 05:22.447
WHERE I COME FROM,
WE ALWAYS BURY OUR DEAD.

05:24.824 --> 05:26.367
THANK YOU.

05:28.828 --> 05:29.662
JOE?

05:29.746 --> 05:31.539
HMM?

05:31.622 --> 05:35.251
YOU BURIED YOUR FATHER
WHEN HE DIED, DIDN'T YOU?

05:35.334 --> 05:37.045
YES. WHY?

05:37.128 --> 05:39.714
JUST CHECKING.

05:39.797 --> 05:41.090
JOSEPH.

05:41.174 --> 05:43.926
JUST THE MAN I'M LOOKING FOR.

05:44.010 --> 05:46.971
LAST NIGHT I FOUND YOU

05:47.055 --> 05:50.266
THE PERFECT WOMAN.

05:50.349 --> 05:51.934
DID YOU LISTEN
TO WHAT I SAID?

05:52.018 --> 05:53.269
{\an3}I HEARD.

05:53.352 --> 05:55.480
{\an1}BUT I ALSO HEARD YOUR CRIES
FOR HELP

05:55.563 --> 05:56.439
AND I WAS MOVED.

05:56.522 --> 05:58.107
YOU WASTED YOUR TIME.

05:58.191 --> 05:59.442
{\an3}DON'T YOU
WANT TO KNOW

05:59.525 --> 06:01.652
{\an3}WHO THE DATE
OF YOUR DREAMS IS?

06:01.736 --> 06:03.946
OOH, I'M CURIOUS.

06:04.030 --> 06:06.074
HER NAME IS CINDY.

06:06.157 --> 06:08.951
WELL, THAT CHANGES EVERYTHING.

06:09.035 --> 06:10.328
CINDY.

06:10.411 --> 06:12.330
JOE AND <i> CINDY.</i>

06:12.413 --> 06:14.332
<i>CINDY</i> AND JOE.

06:14.415 --> 06:16.959
I CAN SEE THAT
ON TOWELS.

06:17.043 --> 06:19.378
JOE, CINDY IS A NICE NAME.

06:19.462 --> 06:21.339
IN MY STEWARDESS DAYS

06:21.422 --> 06:25.134
{\an1}I ONCE FLEW
WITH A GIRL NAMED CINDY.

06:25.218 --> 06:28.429
{\an1}SHE SPILLED A BAG OF PEANUTS
IN A MINISTER'S LAP

06:28.513 --> 06:30.807
THEN MADE THE MISTAKE
OF GOING AFTER THEM.

06:32.934 --> 06:35.520
IT'S NOW IN THE TRAINING MANUAL

06:35.603 --> 06:38.648
UNDER THE HEADING,
"DON'T EVER DO THIS."

06:38.731 --> 06:42.318
{\an1}BRIAN, I'M GOING
TO TAKE A PASS ON CINDY.

06:42.401 --> 06:45.988
{\an1}NO, NO, JOE,
I'LL TELL YOU STRAIGHT.

06:46.072 --> 06:48.032
IF YOU DON'T GO OUT WITH CINDY

06:48.116 --> 06:49.534
HER BEST FRIEND GAIL

06:49.617 --> 06:51.327
DOESN'T GO OUT WITH ME.

06:51.410 --> 06:52.703
ALL RIGHT.

06:52.787 --> 06:55.540
{\an1}REMEMBER THAT FANTASY
I'VE HAD SINCE JUNIOR HIGH?

06:55.623 --> 06:57.667
YOU'RE KIDDING.

06:57.750 --> 06:59.127
I SWEAR.

06:59.210 --> 07:02.505
{\an3}YOU FOUND A SIX-FOOT,
REDHEADED ORIENTAL GIRL?

07:02.588 --> 07:04.173
AND SHE COULD COOK.

07:04.257 --> 07:08.344
JOE, GOD LOVE HER, SHE CAN COOK.

07:08.427 --> 07:10.805
JOE HAS A POLICY
OF NO BLIND DATES.

07:10.888 --> 07:12.181
MORE RULES?

07:12.265 --> 07:14.142
WHAT IS IT WITH YOU PEOPLE?

07:14.225 --> 07:16.394
DO YOU THINK
I WOULD PUT YOU

07:16.477 --> 07:20.523
{\an1}IN THE AWKWARD POSITION
OF DATING A PERFECT STRANGER?

07:20.606 --> 07:23.359
I HAVE CINDY
WAITING RIGHT OUTSIDE.

07:23.442 --> 07:25.069
ARE YOU OUT
OF YOUR MIND?

07:25.153 --> 07:26.737
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?

07:26.821 --> 07:28.364
{\an1}I CAN'T
EVEN IMAGINE IT.

07:28.447 --> 07:31.159
A SIX-FOOT,
REDHEAD ORIENTAL.

07:32.785 --> 07:35.663
CINDY McGRATH, JOE HACKETT.

07:35.746 --> 07:38.249
JOE, CINDY.

07:38.332 --> 07:39.333
HI.

07:39.417 --> 07:40.459
HI.

07:46.132 --> 07:49.010
SO.

07:49.093 --> 07:53.139
SO.

07:53.222 --> 07:55.474
BOY, DO I FEEL
LIKE A THIRD WHEEL.

07:58.561 --> 08:02.565
BRIAN TELLS ME
THAT YOU'RE A PILOT, TOO.

08:02.648 --> 08:04.192
THAT'S SO EXCITING.

08:04.275 --> 08:06.360
BRIAN'S TOLD ME ALL ABOUT...

08:06.444 --> 08:07.445
YOUR NAME.

08:09.864 --> 08:11.115
SO, WHAT DO YOU DO?

08:11.199 --> 08:12.992
I WORK AT THE DRUGSTORE.

08:13.075 --> 08:15.912
{\an1}I'M THE HEAD
OF THE COSMETICS DEPARTMENT.

08:15.995 --> 08:17.705
SOUNDS FASCINATING.

08:17.788 --> 08:19.540
OH, IT IS.

08:19.624 --> 08:22.960
I MEAN, THE RIGHT COLORS
CAN JUST MAKE SUCH A DIFFERENCE.

08:23.044 --> 08:24.587
WELL, TAKE YOUR FACE.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.672
GREAT BONE STRUCTURE, BUT...

08:26.756 --> 08:29.759
I COULD DO WONDERS
WITH A LITTLE BRONZER.

08:29.842 --> 08:32.510
{\an3}SORT OF A JULIO IGLESIAS
KIND OF A THING.

08:35.472 --> 08:37.390
THANK YOU.

08:37.475 --> 08:40.477
DO YOU HAVE
A LITTLE GIRLS' ROOM?

08:40.561 --> 08:43.940
{\an1}I HAVE THIS AWFUL FEELING
THAT MY EYE SHADOW IS WRONG.

08:44.023 --> 08:45.358
YEAH.

08:48.236 --> 08:51.113
SURE, IT'S RIGHT UP
THE STAIRS THERE.

08:51.197 --> 08:52.949
{\an3}SO, JOE.

08:53.032 --> 08:54.951
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

08:55.034 --> 08:56.744
OW, OW, EAR,
PAIN, HURTS.

08:56.827 --> 08:57.954
HATE THAT.

08:58.037 --> 08:59.956
WHAT DID YOU GET ME INTO?

09:00.039 --> 09:03.084
{\an1}COME ON, JOE,
IT'S NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL.

09:03.167 --> 09:05.294
I ASKED HIM NOT TO DO THIS.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.588
LOOK, IT'S ONE DAY
OUT OF YOUR LIFE.

09:07.672 --> 09:09.632
YOU'RE RIGHT,
SHE'S NOT SO BAD.

09:09.715 --> 09:11.842
AND I'VE BEEN MEANING
TO GET OUT.

09:11.926 --> 09:14.095
SHE'S NOT EXACTLY
MY TYPE, BUT ...

09:14.178 --> 09:17.473
{\an1}HACKETT, FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD
ABOUT CINDY McGRATH

09:17.557 --> 09:20.017
SHE'S PRETTY MUCH
EVERYBODY'S TYPE.

09:20.101 --> 09:21.435
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

09:21.519 --> 09:24.480
{\an1}THAT THE CINDY THAT
LIVES ON MATTICUTT ROAD?

09:24.563 --> 09:25.606
THAT'S THE ONE.

09:25.690 --> 09:27.650
ONE WHAT?

09:27.733 --> 09:32.488
{\an1}JOE, LET ME SEE IF I CAN
FIND THE WORDS TO EXPLAIN IT.

09:32.572 --> 09:35.825
NO.

09:35.908 --> 09:37.493
LOOK, HACKETT.

09:37.576 --> 09:40.663
CINDY'S GOT
A CERTAIN REPUTATION.

09:40.746 --> 09:45.793
A LOT OF GUYS TEND TO DROP
BY HER PLACE ON WEEKENDS.

09:45.876 --> 09:48.337
ARE YOU TELLING ME
SHE'S A PRO?

09:48.421 --> 09:49.672
HACKETT, RELAX.

09:49.755 --> 09:51.716
SHE'S NO PROFESSIONAL.

09:51.799 --> 09:55.636
{\an1}BUT SHE'S UNQUESTIONABLY
THE ISLAND'S RANKING AMATEUR.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.305
WHAT IS SHE DOING HERE?

09:57.388 --> 09:58.806
SHE'S DATING JOE.

09:58.889 --> 09:59.807
(<i> laughing</i> )

09:59.890 --> 10:01.142
I AM NOT DATING HER.

10:01.225 --> 10:03.519
{\an3}YOU KNEW ABOUT THIS,
DIDN'T YOU?

10:03.602 --> 10:06.063
{\an1}I DID KNOW,
BUT SHE'S TRYING TO CHANGE.

10:06.147 --> 10:08.357
{\an1}GAIL ASKED ME
TO FIND SOMEONE

10:08.441 --> 10:10.526
NICE, DEPENDABLE,
A REAL GENTLEMAN.

10:10.609 --> 10:12.695
{\an1}EXCUSE ME, JOE,
I THOUGHT OF YOU.

10:12.778 --> 10:14.322
I'M BACK, JOE.

10:14.405 --> 10:17.825
NOW.

10:17.908 --> 10:20.328
ISN'T THIS BETTER?

10:20.411 --> 10:22.663
MY EYE SHADOW WAS
COMPLETELY WRONG.

10:22.747 --> 10:23.998
ME, A PROFESSIONAL.

10:24.081 --> 10:27.710
WHOOPS, I STAND CORRECTED.

10:27.793 --> 10:31.881
CINDY, BRIAN SHOULDN'T HAVE...

10:31.964 --> 10:35.092
I JUST DON'T THINK...

10:35.176 --> 10:37.219
YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT ME, RIGHT?

10:37.303 --> 10:39.055
WELL, SOME OF THE GUYS...

10:39.138 --> 10:41.057
{\an1}IT'S OKAY,
I'M USED TO IT.

10:41.140 --> 10:42.892
LOOK, I'M REALLY SORRY.

10:42.975 --> 10:45.728
YEAH, ME, TOO.

10:45.811 --> 10:49.273
THANKS FOR NOT COMING UP
WITH SOME STUPID EXCUSE.

10:49.357 --> 10:52.068
BELIEVE ME,
I'VE HEARD SOME DOOZIES.

10:52.151 --> 10:54.904
WELL, I GUESS IT'S JUST
NOT IN THE CARDS

10:54.987 --> 10:57.615
FOR ME TO GO OUT
WITH A NICE GUY.

10:57.698 --> 10:59.283
CINDY, WAIT.

11:00.951 --> 11:02.078
I DON'T SEE WHY

11:02.161 --> 11:04.747
WE COULDN'T GO OUT
TO DINNER SOMETIME.

11:04.830 --> 11:06.749
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO THIS.

11:06.832 --> 11:08.125
REALLY, I WANT TO.

11:08.209 --> 11:09.293
SATURDAY NIGHT OKAY?

11:09.377 --> 11:10.378
ABOUT 8:00?

11:10.461 --> 11:13.381
I'D LIKE THAT.

11:13.464 --> 11:14.173
THANKS.

11:15.466 --> 11:17.176
SO YOU'LL CALL ME?

11:17.259 --> 11:18.135
SURE.

11:18.219 --> 11:19.178
GREAT.

11:21.472 --> 11:23.391
HERE YOU GO, HACKETT.

11:23.474 --> 11:25.309
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED THIS.

11:25.393 --> 11:26.560
WHAT IS IT?

11:26.644 --> 11:28.562
CINDY'S TELEPHONE NUMBER.

11:28.646 --> 11:31.440
{\an1}I FOUND IT CARVED
ON THAT POST OVER THERE.

11:42.201 --> 11:44.286
HEY, BIG GUY.

11:44.370 --> 11:47.748
DON'T LET WHAT THOSE YAHOOS SAID
ABOUT CINDY BOTHER YOU.

11:47.832 --> 11:48.791
TONGUES WAG.

11:48.874 --> 11:50.251
FRANK, COME IN HERE.

11:50.334 --> 11:52.461
YOU'RE NOT DOING MY EARS AGAIN.

11:52.545 --> 11:53.963
I WILL TAKE CINDY OUT.

11:54.046 --> 11:56.132
BUT YOU CAN'T KEEP DOING THIS.

11:56.215 --> 11:57.341
I HAVE A REPUTATION.

11:57.425 --> 11:58.759
I'M A BUSINESSMAN.

11:58.843 --> 12:00.553
I'M NOT LOOKING FORWARD

12:00.636 --> 12:02.972
{\an1}TO WALKING DOWN THE STREET
WITH CINDY

12:03.055 --> 12:05.266
AND HAVING PEOPLE POINT AT ME.

12:05.349 --> 12:06.809
YOU'RE OVERREACTING.

12:06.892 --> 12:09.645
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE POINTING
AT YOU.

12:09.728 --> 12:11.480
THEY'LL BE POINTING AT HER.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.190
GO AWAY AND LEAVE ME ALONE.

12:13.274 --> 12:14.442
OKAY.

12:14.525 --> 12:16.193
HAVE FUN SATURDAY NIGHT.

12:16.277 --> 12:18.612
{\an1}WHOA, YOU'RE GOING
TO BE THERE.

12:18.696 --> 12:20.489
THAT WAS THE DEAL, WASN'T IT?

12:20.573 --> 12:23.451
{\an1}NO, THE DEAL WAS THAT I FIND
A DATE FOR CINDY.

12:23.534 --> 12:25.244
YOU'RE FORGETTING.

12:25.327 --> 12:28.956
{\an1}IF I DON'T GO OUT WITH CINDY,
YOU DON'T GO OUT WITH GAIL

12:29.039 --> 12:31.167
AND... I FEEL A COLD COMING ON.

12:31.250 --> 12:33.169
GOD, YOU ARE MANIPULATIVE.

12:33.252 --> 12:36.714
I LEARNED AT THE FEET
OF THE MASTER.

12:36.797 --> 12:38.507
AM I INTERRUPTING
ANYTHING?

12:38.591 --> 12:40.176
NO, WE'RE ABOUT DONE.

12:40.259 --> 12:41.886
ARE YOU FINISHED MOCKING?

12:41.969 --> 12:43.804
FOR NOW, BUT STAY CLOSE.

12:46.056 --> 12:46.974
LOOK, JOE...

12:47.057 --> 12:48.726
I KNOW YOU'RE
UNCOMFORTABLE

12:48.809 --> 12:50.352
SO I WANTED TO SAY--

12:50.436 --> 12:52.354
I REMEMBER HOW MUCH
IT HURT

12:52.438 --> 12:54.148
{\an3}WHEN PEOPLE REFERRED
TO ME

12:54.231 --> 12:56.525
AS THAT FAT GIRL
WITH THE CELLO.

12:56.609 --> 12:59.403
THEN SOMEONE
LOOKED PAST MY WEIGHT.

12:59.487 --> 13:00.988
THEY SAW THE REAL ME

13:01.071 --> 13:04.366
AND IT GAVE ME THE STRENGTH
TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

13:04.450 --> 13:06.035
THANKS TO YOU

13:06.118 --> 13:09.371
CINDY MAY NOT BE A TRAMP
FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE.

13:09.455 --> 13:12.374
{\an3}I JUST WANTED TO COME IN
AND SAY, "NICE GOING."

13:12.458 --> 13:15.169
OH, WELL, THANKS.

13:15.252 --> 13:16.670
AND WHO KNOWS?

13:16.754 --> 13:21.050
IF CINDY DECIDES NOT TO REFORM,
YOU MIGHT GET LUCKY.

13:30.017 --> 13:31.936
JOE, DON'T YOU LOOK NICE?

13:32.019 --> 13:33.562
THANK YOU, FAYE.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.731
{\an1}YOU AND CINDY
HAVE FUN TONIGHT.

13:35.814 --> 13:38.192
I HOPE YOU PUT
A LITTLE SOMETHING EXTRA

13:38.275 --> 13:38.984
IN YOUR WALLET.

13:41.987 --> 13:43.447
FAYE!

13:43.531 --> 13:44.907
AN EXTRA FIVE DOLLARS

13:44.990 --> 13:47.201
{\an1}IN CASE YOU HAVE
TO GRAB A CAB.

13:47.284 --> 13:49.745
OH, RIGHT.

13:49.828 --> 13:51.539
{\an1}WHAT DID YOU THINK
I MEANT?

13:51.622 --> 13:53.541
UH, NOTHING, NOTHING.

13:53.624 --> 13:55.376
Man:
HEY, JOE...

13:55.459 --> 13:58.546
{\an3}WORD'S OUT YOU'RE DATING
CINDY McGRATH.

13:58.629 --> 13:59.755
WHO TOLD YOU?

13:59.838 --> 14:01.131
RIGHT OVER HERE.

14:01.215 --> 14:04.176
SHOOT ME, JOE,
IT WAS A SLOW NEWS DAY.

14:04.260 --> 14:07.263
HOW MANY TIMES
DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU

14:07.346 --> 14:08.847
I AM NOT DATING HER.

14:08.931 --> 14:10.266
RIGHT, HACKETT.

14:10.349 --> 14:13.269
{\an1}I KNOW A GUY WHO DIDN'T
DATE HER LAST WEEK.

14:13.352 --> 14:15.104
TWICE.

14:15.187 --> 14:17.606
SHUT UP, ROY.

14:17.690 --> 14:20.776
{\an1}BRIAN, DO YOU AND GAIL
WANT TO PICK US UP

14:20.859 --> 14:23.612
{\an1}OR SHALL WE MEET
AT THE RESTAURANT?

14:23.696 --> 14:26.782
{\an3}JOE, THERE'S BEEN
A SLIGHT CHANGE IN PLANS.

14:26.865 --> 14:29.076
APPARENTLY, I DRANK A LOT MORE

14:29.159 --> 14:30.619
THAN I THOUGHT.

14:30.703 --> 14:31.954
GAIL'S HAIR IS NOT RED.

14:32.037 --> 14:33.122
SHE'S NOT ORIENTAL.

14:33.205 --> 14:35.124
SHE WAS STANDING ON A BARSTOOL.

14:35.207 --> 14:37.293
I'D SAY CINDY IS QUITE A CATCH.

14:37.376 --> 14:40.296
{\an1}IF I'M SUFFERING THIS EVENING,
YOU'LL SUFFER, TOO.

14:40.379 --> 14:43.674
{\an1}I DON'T CARE HOW YOU DO IT
OR WHERE SHE COMES FROM.

14:43.757 --> 14:45.801
I DON'T CARE
IF SHE HAS AN AIR VALVE

14:45.884 --> 14:47.636
STICKING OUT OF HER NECK.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.555
YOU'RE FILLING
THAT FOURTH CHAIR.

14:49.638 --> 14:51.974
COFFEE, BRIAN?

14:52.057 --> 14:54.977
{\an1}HELEN, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING IN AN HOUR?

14:55.060 --> 14:55.978
NOTHING SPECIAL.

14:56.061 --> 14:56.979
{\an1}PERFECT.

14:57.062 --> 14:58.147
FORGET IT, JOE.

14:58.230 --> 15:01.150
SHE'S GOT SOME RULE
ABOUT DATING PILOTS.

15:01.233 --> 15:02.651
OKAY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

15:02.735 --> 15:04.778
IF BRIAN DOESN'T GET A DATE

15:04.862 --> 15:06.989
{\an1}I HAVE TO GO OUT WITH CINDY
ALONE.

15:07.072 --> 15:08.824
I RESPECT YOUR PRINCIPLES.

15:08.907 --> 15:10.826
I'VE ADMIRED YOUR INTEGRITY.

15:10.909 --> 15:13.996
{\an1}I'M ASKING YOU AS A FRIEND
TO PUT YOUR RULE ASIDE

15:14.079 --> 15:15.289
AND HELP ME OUT.

15:15.372 --> 15:17.666
OH, THAT'S LOVELY, JOE.

15:17.750 --> 15:22.671
{\an1}I'M SO CHOKED UP I CAN BARELY
GET OUT THE WORD "NO."

15:22.755 --> 15:25.174
{\an1}IF YOU WON'T DO IT FOR ME,
DO IT FOR CINDY.

15:25.257 --> 15:27.009
OR MAYBE YOU'VE FORGOTTEN

15:27.092 --> 15:29.303
{\an1}WHAT YOU SAID
ABOUT HER REPUTATION.

15:29.386 --> 15:31.764
HE'S GOOD, ISN'T HE?

15:35.434 --> 15:36.560
OH, ALL RIGHT.

15:36.644 --> 15:38.145
LOOKS LIKE YOU AND I

15:38.228 --> 15:41.565
ARE GOING TO GO OUT
ON A DATE AFTER ALL.

15:41.649 --> 15:43.025
AND WHO KNOWS?

15:43.108 --> 15:45.653
IF THINGS WORK OUT,
YOU MIGHT GET LUCKY.

15:57.289 --> 16:00.376
YOU KNOW, HELEN,
I WAS WONDERING

16:00.459 --> 16:03.712
WHEN WE WERE YOUNGER,
BEFORE I WAS A PILOT

16:03.796 --> 16:06.423
BEFORE YOU MADE THAT SILLY RULE

16:06.507 --> 16:10.052
WHY IS IT YOU AND I NEVER
DATED ONE ANOTHER?

16:10.135 --> 16:13.389
WELL, FOR ONE, YOU'RE OBNOXIOUS.

16:13.472 --> 16:16.392
OH, YEAH.

16:16.475 --> 16:18.852
AND YOU WERE HUGE.

16:18.936 --> 16:21.438
THAT'S TRUE.

16:21.522 --> 16:23.315
BUT I'VE GOTTEN THINNER.

16:27.861 --> 16:29.780
{\an1}Helen:
HI, GUYS!

16:29.863 --> 16:30.989
HI.

16:31.073 --> 16:34.868
All:
HEY, CINDY, WHOA, CINDY.

16:39.873 --> 16:41.041
I'M SORRY, JOE.

16:41.125 --> 16:43.252
YOU WANT TO GO
SOMEPLACE ELSE?

16:43.335 --> 16:45.838
IS THERE ANYPLACE ELSE
WE COULD GO?

16:45.921 --> 16:48.048
NEW HAMPSHIRE.

16:48.132 --> 16:49.341
THIS WILL DO.

16:49.425 --> 16:51.260
CINDY, MEET HELEN CHAPEL.

16:51.343 --> 16:52.594
HI.

16:52.678 --> 16:55.055
OH, HI, NICE TO SEE YOU.

16:55.139 --> 16:57.433
I REMEMBER YOU
FROM THE OTHER DAY.

16:57.516 --> 16:58.600
HAIR, HONEY BLONDE.

16:58.684 --> 17:00.728
BLUSH, DUSTY ROSE.

17:00.811 --> 17:03.272
AND LIP GLOSS,
TAHITIAN SUNRISE.

17:03.355 --> 17:04.440
RIGHT?

17:04.522 --> 17:06.275
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

17:06.358 --> 17:08.026
IT'S MY BUSINESS.

17:16.910 --> 17:21.290
DO YOU LIKE
THIS NAIL COLOR?

17:21.373 --> 17:22.665
YES, THAT'S NICE.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.752
{\an3}I WAS GOING
TO ASK ABOUT IT.

17:24.835 --> 17:28.047
{\an1}I TRIED 14 DIFFERENT SHADES
BEFORE I GOT IT RIGHT.

17:28.130 --> 17:29.631
I'M PRETTY HAPPY WITH IT.

17:29.715 --> 17:31.842
SO ARE WE.

17:33.510 --> 17:35.429
HEY, CINDY, HI.

17:35.512 --> 17:36.805
REMEMBER ME?

17:36.889 --> 17:38.474
GEE, I DON'T...

17:38.557 --> 17:39.725
SURE, YOU DO. JIMMY.

17:41.393 --> 17:42.519
REMEMBER?

17:42.603 --> 17:43.771
I WAS GOING TO CALL

17:43.854 --> 17:45.481
BUT I LOST YOUR NUMBER.

17:45.564 --> 17:46.815
GIVE IT TO ME AGAIN.

17:46.899 --> 17:47.941
HEY, WHAT THE...

17:48.025 --> 17:51.111
I WAS AFRAID THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

17:51.195 --> 17:54.364
LOOK, JIMMY, WE WERE
ABOUT TO ORDER HERE.

17:54.448 --> 17:55.157
A MINUTE, OKAY?

17:55.240 --> 17:56.658
{\an1}NOT NOW.

17:56.742 --> 17:59.828
I'M GOING TO CALL YOU THIS TIME,
I PROMISE.

17:59.912 --> 18:03.207
{\an1}REMEMBER ALL THE FUN WE HAD
ON STEVE WILSON'S BOAT?

18:03.290 --> 18:05.626
YOU, STEVE, THAT BIG BRUNETTE...

18:05.709 --> 18:06.877
I'M BUSY RIGHT NOW.

18:06.960 --> 18:07.961
BUT WHAT WAS HER NAME?

18:08.045 --> 18:10.005
MAYBE SHE DOESN'T REMEMBER.

18:10.088 --> 18:13.008
ARE YOU HER?

18:13.091 --> 18:14.968
NO.

18:15.052 --> 18:19.181
{\an1}YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE DOES
OR DOESN'T REMEMBER.

18:19.264 --> 18:21.141
WHAT'S IN THE NEPTUNE'S BOUNTY?

18:21.225 --> 18:23.519
WHY DON'T WE TALK
SOME OTHER TIME.

18:23.602 --> 18:25.479
HOW ABOUT LATER TONIGHT?

18:25.562 --> 18:26.480
HEY, BUDDY...

18:26.563 --> 18:27.856
I'M NOT YOUR BUDDY.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.859
{\an1}JUST TRYING TO HAVE LAUGHS
WITH THE LADY.

18:30.943 --> 18:34.154
{\an3}CINDY IS
WITH MY BROTHER JOE NOW.

18:34.238 --> 18:36.698
SHE DOESN'T LAUGH ANYMORE.

18:36.782 --> 18:39.493
BRIAN, MAYBE YOU SHOULD...

18:39.576 --> 18:41.370
YEAH, MAYBE YOU SHOULD.

18:41.453 --> 18:43.413
OKAY, LOOK,
JIMMY, JIMMY...

18:43.497 --> 18:45.499
WE'RE JUST TRYING
TO HAVE

18:45.582 --> 18:47.042
A SIMPLE LITTLE
DINNER HERE.

18:47.125 --> 18:50.212
OH, REALLY?

18:50.295 --> 18:52.714
REALLY WISH YOU
WOULDN'T DO THAT.

18:52.798 --> 18:55.050
JOE DOES NOT CARE
FOR SARCASM.

18:55.134 --> 18:58.178
{\an1}JOE, IF YOU GOT A PROBLEM,
JUST SPEAK UP.

18:58.262 --> 18:59.388
NOW YOU'VE DONE IT.

18:59.471 --> 19:00.722
HE HATES THAT.

19:00.806 --> 19:02.724
I'M SORRY, JOE,
I DIDN'T MEAN...

19:02.808 --> 19:04.852
CINDY, IT'S
NOT ABOUT YOU.

19:04.935 --> 19:07.271
THIS IS BETWEEN JIMMY
AND JOE.

19:07.354 --> 19:10.274
{\an1}I'M GETTING A LITTLE TIRED
OF YOUR ATTITUDE.

19:10.357 --> 19:11.859
I'VE HARDLY SAID A WORD.

19:11.942 --> 19:14.403
YOU BETTER START TALKING.

19:14.486 --> 19:16.780
OKAY, I KNOW HOW TO HANDLE THIS.

19:16.864 --> 19:19.575
NOW, LOOK, WE'VE HEARD
JUST ABOUT ENOUGH...

19:19.658 --> 19:21.326
ARE YOU OKAY?

19:22.703 --> 19:24.746
OKAY, TAKE IT OUTSIDE.

19:24.830 --> 19:26.331
OUTSIDE, OUTSIDE,
COME ON.

19:26.415 --> 19:27.291
{\an1}JOE...

19:27.374 --> 19:28.417
I'LL TAKE CARE OF HIM.

19:28.500 --> 19:29.459
NEED ANY HELP?

19:29.543 --> 19:32.087
NO, YOU'VE DONE ENOUGH.

19:32.170 --> 19:35.632
BOY, TROUBLE JUST SEEMS TO FIND
THAT GUY.

19:40.470 --> 19:43.182
Helen:
YOU KNOW, UNTIL TODAY

19:43.265 --> 19:46.602
I NEVER REALLY NOTICED
THE FAMILY RESEMBLANCE.

19:46.685 --> 19:48.770
{\an1}GOD, THIS IS
SO EMBARRASSING.

19:48.854 --> 19:50.814
OH, WOULD YOU
JUST FORGET IT.

19:50.898 --> 19:53.442
{\an3}NOBODY YOU KNOW WILL
EVER HEAR OF IT.

19:53.525 --> 19:54.776
(<i> bell clanging</i> )

19:54.860 --> 19:59.740
WELL, WELL...

19:59.823 --> 20:02.409
IF IT ISN'T THE SPINKS BROTHERS.

20:02.492 --> 20:05.412
CAN IT, ROY.

20:05.495 --> 20:07.122
I BETTER WATCH IT.

20:07.205 --> 20:09.249
WORD'S OUT AROUND TOWN.

20:09.333 --> 20:11.877
YOU BOYS THROW A MEAN NOSE.

20:11.960 --> 20:14.630
SANDPIPER AIR FLIGHT 26
TO BOSTON

20:14.713 --> 20:16.423
IS NOW BOARDING.

20:20.344 --> 20:21.261
CINDY

20:21.345 --> 20:23.597
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

20:25.098 --> 20:26.850
I'M LEAVING YOU, JOE.

20:28.894 --> 20:29.811
EXCUSE ME?

20:29.895 --> 20:32.648
LET'S NOT KID OURSELVES.

20:32.731 --> 20:34.232
{\an1}WE GOT IN
OVER OUR HEADS.

20:34.316 --> 20:36.693
LAST NIGHT MADE ME REALIZE

20:36.777 --> 20:40.614
{\an1}WITH MY REPUTATION,
I'LL NEVER MAKE IT HERE.

20:40.697 --> 20:42.199
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

20:42.282 --> 20:43.492
CINDY, I...

20:43.575 --> 20:45.369
PLEASE!

20:45.452 --> 20:49.498
I KNOW IT WOULD KILL YOU
EVERY TIME SOME GUY LOOKED AT ME

20:49.581 --> 20:51.291
THE WAY GUYS LOOK AT ME.

20:51.375 --> 20:53.335
{\an1}SO...

20:53.418 --> 20:56.338
{\an1}I'VE DECIDED TO MOVE
AND GET A FRESH START.

20:56.421 --> 20:57.798
{\an1}BE STRONG.

20:57.881 --> 21:00.133
EVENTUALLY, YOU'LL GET OVER IT.

21:00.217 --> 21:03.679
WELL, IT WON'T BE EASY,
BUT I'LL TRY.

21:03.762 --> 21:08.016
THAT'S MY JOE.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.685
WELL...

21:09.768 --> 21:12.020
GOODBYE. AND THANKS AGAIN.

21:12.104 --> 21:14.022
YOU'RE THE FIRST GUY

21:14.106 --> 21:17.025
{\an1}WHO EVER TREATED ME
LIKE A LADY.

21:23.490 --> 21:25.200
DON'T DO THIS, JOE.

21:25.283 --> 21:28.537
{\an1}JUST LET ME WALK OUT
OF YOUR LIFE.

21:28.620 --> 21:33.542
{\an1}I WANT TO REMEMBER YOU
THE WAY YOU ARE RIGHT NOW.

21:33.625 --> 21:36.378
WELL, MAYBE WITHOUT THE BANDAGE.

21:36.461 --> 21:38.714
OKAY?

21:38.797 --> 21:40.132
OKAY.

21:44.094 --> 21:46.555
JOE, YOUR LIFE IS HERE.

21:46.638 --> 21:48.348
LONG-DISTANCE RELATIONSHIPS

21:48.432 --> 21:50.350
NEVER WORK.

21:50.434 --> 21:52.728
CINDY, I...

21:59.985 --> 22:02.904
{\an1}JOE, JOE, YOU'RE RIPPING
MY HEART OUT.

22:02.988 --> 22:05.407
DON'T FOLLOW ME LIKE THIS.

22:05.490 --> 22:07.617
CINDY, I HAVE TO.

22:07.701 --> 22:10.037
{\an1}I'M THE PILOT
OF YOUR FLIGHT.

22:11.663 --> 22:13.623
OH!

22:17.336 --> 22:20.797
NOT EXACTLY THE END
OF <i> CASABLANCA,</i> WAS IT?
