00:58.526 --> 01:00.977
it was like an outpost.

01:01.077 --> 01:04.111
To our friends in Manhattan,
we might as well...

01:04.212 --> 01:05.899
...have moved to Nebraska.

01:05.999 --> 01:08.118
It was out of fashion,

01:08.218 --> 01:10.405
but a good place for a struggling artist...

01:10.505 --> 01:10.905
...like me.

01:11.005 --> 01:12.789
And we liked it,

01:12.889 --> 01:14.991
which was good because--...

01:15.091 --> 01:19.341
...       Good morning.
it was all we could afford.

01:19.345 --> 01:21.407
Morning, Mr. Rahim.
Good morning.

01:21.507 --> 01:22.116
Mr. Carver.

01:22.216 --> 01:23.867
Good morning,
Dorothy.

01:23.967 --> 01:26.069
So, tomorrow's the big day.

01:26.169 --> 01:29.139
You ready to move?
I don't know.

01:29.239 --> 01:31.541
I would get out of here
in a minute if I could.

01:31.641 --> 01:33.309
Ah.
Where would you go?

01:33.409 --> 01:35.409
Where would I go?

01:35.478 --> 01:38.848
New York is the best city in the world.

01:38.948 --> 01:41.518
Hello? Hello?

01:41.618 --> 01:43.186
Ruth?

01:43.286 --> 01:46.489
It's like talking to somebody
on the wreck of the Titanic.

01:46.589 --> 01:48.091
Ruth?

01:48.191 --> 01:51.394
Hello? Ruth?

01:51.494 --> 01:53.897
Ruth?

01:53.997 --> 01:56.887
Uh, what am I looking for in here?

02:00.153 --> 02:03.073
Oh-- Uh, I'm losing you.

02:03.173 --> 02:05.970
Alex, stop moving around.
Are you near the door?

02:06.070 --> 02:07.128
Listen to me. Yeah.

02:07.228 --> 02:10.680
It's in the rack.
Oh. Mm-hmm.

02:10.780 --> 02:12.782
Yeah. Lily's coming,
so I gotta go.

02:12.882 --> 02:15.303
Yeah, she's here.
So I'll talk to you later.

02:15.403 --> 02:16.203
You'll be fine.

02:16.303 --> 02:19.923
Aunt Ruth, I don't know
how you and Alex do it.

02:20.023 --> 02:23.026
I'm 40-whatever,
and look at me.

02:23.126 --> 02:24.794
Jesus, I gotta--.

02:24.894 --> 02:26.025
I gotta join a gym.

02:26.125 --> 02:26.814
Thank you.

02:26.914 --> 02:29.719
Uh, excuse me.
Where is the Times?

02:34.988 --> 02:37.407
Aunt Ruth,
hide this.

02:37.507 --> 02:39.196
We're gonna see a lot of action...

02:39.296 --> 02:39.827
...tomorrow.

02:39.927 --> 02:41.696
Your mother gave that to me.

02:41.796 --> 02:42.096
Well--...

02:42.196 --> 02:44.948
...     I wish she hadn't smoked so much.

02:45.048 --> 02:46.898
Guess people don't really give ashtrays...

02:46.998 --> 02:48.235
...as gifts anymore, do they?

02:48.335 --> 02:51.287
I don't know if people
even make them anymore.

02:51.387 --> 02:53.644
So, the shades all have to be up.

02:53.744 --> 02:53.941
Oh.

02:54.041 --> 02:56.159
Light is money.
Remember that.

02:56.259 --> 02:58.084
How many people will come, do you think?

02:58.184 --> 02:58.679
Who knows.

02:58.779 --> 03:00.998
But what we want are the serious ones.

03:01.098 --> 03:01.248
Oh.

03:01.348 --> 03:03.489
You always get the lookers,
the people who just come...

03:03.589 --> 03:04.718
...to see how other people live.

03:04.818 --> 03:07.520
It makes them feel better about their lives.

03:07.620 --> 03:09.056
Or worse. Who knows.

03:09.156 --> 03:12.817
So, when you're trying to sell,
you don't want any clutter.

03:12.917 --> 03:13.394
Uh-huh.

03:13.494 --> 03:15.494
Less is more.

03:15.511 --> 03:17.747
All the books gotta go away.

03:17.847 --> 03:20.850
Chekhov.
The Lady with the Dog.

03:20.950 --> 03:23.286
This was my favorite story to teach.

03:23.386 --> 03:23.871
Uh-huh.

03:23.971 --> 03:26.062
The girls loved it,
but I remember the boys.

03:26.162 --> 03:26.774
not so much.

03:26.874 --> 03:29.159
Did you get Uncle Alex to change his mind?

03:29.259 --> 03:31.528
Oh. He's still on the fence about it.

03:31.628 --> 03:34.133
But you know artists--
too much practicality...

03:34.233 --> 03:35.282
...overwhelms them.

03:35.382 --> 03:37.634
Ah. I'll get him there.

03:37.734 --> 03:39.665
Because, you know,
you're looking at maybe...

03:39.765 --> 03:40.454
...a million dollars.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.605
Give or take.
Yeah.

03:42.705 --> 03:44.967
Two years ago it would've been more.

03:45.067 --> 03:46.759
with the feeding frenzy then.

03:46.859 --> 03:48.778
Neighborhood's changed a lot.

03:48.878 --> 03:52.048
It's cool now,
filled with hipsters.

03:52.148 --> 03:54.350
And gentrifiers.

03:54.450 --> 03:57.654
Mothers with baby strollers
that cost as much as a Chevy.

03:57.754 --> 04:00.269
And their banker husbands,
their heads buried...

04:00.369 --> 04:01.509
...in their smartphones.

04:01.609 --> 04:04.894
Crossing the street while
you're trading stocks and bonds...

04:04.994 --> 04:06.747
...doesn't seem that smart to me.

04:06.847 --> 04:08.194
Hey.
Watch where...

04:08.294 --> 04:09.782
...you're goin'.

04:09.882 --> 04:12.969
The neighborhood's
just got itself a Whole Foods.

04:13.069 --> 04:15.369
All it needs now is the ultimate sign...

04:15.469 --> 04:16.923
...of modern civilization--...

04:17.024 --> 04:19.375
...an Apple store.

04:19.475 --> 04:21.577
But as much as it's changing.

04:21.678 --> 04:23.888
I'm gonna miss this place.

04:36.976 --> 04:39.729
Come on, Dorothy.
Come on, baby. Come on.

04:39.829 --> 04:43.229
Come on now. Come on.
That's a good girl.

04:44.918 --> 04:47.030
Good morning,
Mr. Carver.

04:47.130 --> 04:48.104
Oh, hi, Erica.

04:48.204 --> 04:50.434
Are you all ready for the open house?

04:50.534 --> 04:51.358
Uh, I guess so.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.760
It's not the same market
it was a few years ago.

04:53.860 --> 04:54.328
you know.

04:54.428 --> 04:57.413
Well, we're just testing the water.

04:57.513 --> 04:59.836
What you're gonna want
to do tomorrow first thing,

04:59.936 --> 05:00.834
when you wake up--...

05:00.934 --> 05:03.134
...    Mm-hmm?
Turn this on...

05:03.234 --> 05:04.471
...and let it simmer.

05:04.571 --> 05:07.128
Gives the whole apartment a homey feel.

05:07.228 --> 05:07.541
Okay.

05:07.641 --> 05:10.426
Works every time.
Mmm.

05:10.526 --> 05:12.228
Well--.

05:12.328 --> 05:14.796
Let's hope a lot of people
are gonna love this apartment...

05:14.896 --> 05:15.316
...tomorrow.

05:15.416 --> 05:19.071
This is a young people's
building, you know.

05:19.146 --> 05:21.146
The stairs?

05:22.356 --> 05:24.556
Come on.

05:26.292 --> 05:28.292
I know you're tired.

05:28.344 --> 05:30.344
So am I. Come on.

05:33.133 --> 05:35.133
I know. Come on.

05:44.043 --> 05:46.095
Here. Let me try it.

05:46.195 --> 05:49.299
I know how to put a key in the door, but--.

05:49.399 --> 05:51.668
Got it.

05:51.768 --> 05:54.771
What are you doing?

05:54.871 --> 05:57.006
What does it look like I'm doing?

05:57.106 --> 05:59.108
Carrying my bride across the threshold.

05:59.208 --> 06:01.669
What bride?
We've been married...

06:01.769 --> 06:03.769
...two years.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.365
You still like it?

06:07.383 --> 06:09.786
Like it?

06:09.886 --> 06:11.954
I love it.

06:12.054 --> 06:15.073
Oh, look at all this light.

06:17.877 --> 06:19.662
Hi.
I'm Alex Carver.

06:19.762 --> 06:22.397
My wife and I,
we just moved in.

06:32.892 --> 06:34.444
And you didn't when-- Oh.

06:34.544 --> 06:36.333
Hey, Alex.
Hey, Dorothy.

06:36.433 --> 06:36.730
Hey.

06:36.830 --> 06:38.202
Did you have a good walk,

06:38.302 --> 06:38.732
sweetie?

06:38.832 --> 06:40.446
Big day tomorrow.
You all set?

06:40.546 --> 06:40.734
Yes.

06:40.834 --> 06:42.885
- What is that smell?
- Oh, that's cinnamon.

06:42.985 --> 06:44.269
It gives the place a homey feel.

06:44.369 --> 06:45.406
Smells like a whorehouse.

06:45.506 --> 06:47.223
Is that a fact?
Yes.

06:47.323 --> 06:49.662
And what does a whorehouse
smell like, sir?

06:49.762 --> 06:50.944
Well, it smells like this.

06:51.044 --> 06:53.166
So, I'm gonna be bringing the first couple,

06:53.266 --> 06:54.748
the Schuylers, by at 9:00 a.m.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.532
9:00 a.m.

06:56.632 --> 06:58.761
Why not 6:00?
Oh, come on, Alex, please.

06:58.861 --> 06:59.586
You promised.

06:59.686 --> 07:02.038
So, we could be getting
a lot of people here tomorrow,

07:02.138 --> 07:04.264
and if you could tidy up your studio.

07:04.364 --> 07:05.359
it would be great.

07:05.459 --> 07:07.462
It's such a wonderful room,
but it looks smaller than it is...

07:07.562 --> 07:08.195
...with all the clutter.

07:08.295 --> 07:10.313
Anyway-- Clutter.

07:10.413 --> 07:11.399
It's gonna be great.

07:11.499 --> 07:12.499
Good. Thanks, Lily.

07:12.599 --> 07:14.417
- Can hardly wait.
- I'm the man.

07:14.517 --> 07:16.517
Bye, Lily.

07:16.586 --> 07:18.840
You could be nice to her.
She's done a lot of work for us.

07:18.940 --> 07:19.707
She talks too much.

07:19.807 --> 07:22.612
Well, I can't disagree with that.

07:37.957 --> 07:42.292
This room has been my studio
for more than 40 years.

07:43.062 --> 07:46.249
What room will I be painting in next year?

07:46.349 --> 07:48.184
Will it have a view?

07:48.284 --> 07:50.386
Will it even have a window?

07:50.486 --> 07:52.955
I think these could go over here, honey.

07:53.055 --> 07:55.458
All right, here. Here.
I'll take it. I'll take it.

07:55.558 --> 07:57.360
All right. Oh.

07:57.460 --> 07:58.829
You okay?
Okay.

07:58.929 --> 08:00.929
I got it.

08:01.280 --> 08:04.066
Ruth.
What?

08:04.166 --> 08:06.306
We're making a mistake.
What do you want me...

08:06.406 --> 08:06.920
...to do, Alex?

08:07.020 --> 08:09.806
I mean, it's already in the paper.

08:09.906 --> 08:11.342
I just don't want Lily to railroad us...

08:11.442 --> 08:12.426
...like she did her mother.

08:12.526 --> 08:15.378
That's because Sarah was sick.
Please.

08:15.478 --> 08:17.914
Well, where will we go?
Oh, I see.

08:18.014 --> 08:20.583
Well, with a million dollars,
frankly, we could go anywhere.

08:20.683 --> 08:23.318
We might get a million dollars.

08:23.319 --> 08:25.000
Anyway, it'll cost a million dollars to get...

08:25.100 --> 08:26.039
...another place like this.

08:26.139 --> 08:29.258
Not to mention the cost
of moving and selling.

08:29.358 --> 08:31.281
Then we'll go where
the houses are cheaper.

08:31.381 --> 08:32.746
No way we can leave New York.

08:32.846 --> 08:35.264
We're not going to leave New York.

08:35.364 --> 08:37.609
No, all we need is a place for you to paint...

08:37.708 --> 08:38.552
...and an elevator.

08:38.652 --> 08:40.837
I handle the stairs better than Lily does.

08:40.937 --> 08:43.639
Sure, you do now, honey.
But...

08:43.739 --> 08:45.274
...what about later?

08:45.374 --> 08:47.526
Well, I don't know.

08:49.462 --> 08:52.815
You know, I-- I read
about these open houses.

08:52.915 --> 08:54.650
Uh-huh.
People steal things.

08:54.750 --> 08:58.454
Okay, I will nail the furniture to the floor.

08:58.554 --> 09:00.554
All right?

09:00.556 --> 09:02.799
Don't like the idea of
all those people in here.

09:02.899 --> 09:04.244
poking through our things.

09:04.344 --> 09:07.163
You do not have to be here.
You can take a walk.

09:07.263 --> 09:09.288
You can go see a movie.

09:09.388 --> 09:11.388
Well, I might do that.

09:11.817 --> 09:14.837
We're just dipping our toes
into the water. That's all.

09:14.937 --> 09:16.806
Nobody's making any commitments.

09:16.906 --> 09:18.906
Nobody.

09:19.892 --> 09:22.778
What's the matter, sweetheart?
What happened?

09:22.878 --> 09:24.947
What's wrong?
- Alex--.

09:25.047 --> 09:26.748
Something's wrong with Dorothy.

09:26.848 --> 09:27.134
What?

09:27.234 --> 09:29.819
What's the matter?
She's shaking.

09:29.919 --> 09:32.374
She's shaking, and then
when I picked her up...

09:32.474 --> 09:33.240
...she screamed.

09:33.340 --> 09:35.825
What's the matter, girl?
I think she's in pain.

09:35.925 --> 09:37.218
Maybe we should,
I don't know,

09:37.318 --> 09:38.078
take her to the vet.

09:38.178 --> 09:39.829
It's probably nothing.
No?

09:39.929 --> 09:41.863
Remember last year?
Cost us $700...

09:41.963 --> 09:43.283
...to find out she had gas.

09:43.383 --> 09:45.750
Don't try to go so fast.
You're gonna fall down...

09:45.850 --> 09:46.453
...these steps.

09:46.553 --> 09:48.370
I'm not gonna fall down.
She's shaking...

09:48.470 --> 09:49.456
...because she's upset.

09:49.556 --> 09:51.002
I think we could use an elevator.

09:51.102 --> 09:52.159
Don't you, at this point?

09:52.259 --> 09:54.243
I guess we could,
but we don't have one.

09:54.343 --> 09:57.246
- What happened?
- We think it's her back.

09:57.346 --> 09:58.469
You want a cab?
Yeah, please.

09:58.569 --> 09:58.799
Please.

09:58.899 --> 10:01.484
Taxi.

10:01.584 --> 10:03.584
Is there a fire?

10:03.586 --> 10:05.951
They say that there is
a gasoline truck stuck...

10:06.051 --> 10:07.541
...on the Williamsburg Bridge.

10:07.641 --> 10:10.192
Always something,
isn't it?

10:10.292 --> 10:11.898
Thank you, Mr. Rahim.
You're welcome.

10:11.998 --> 10:12.646
You're welcome.

10:12.746 --> 10:14.746
Good luck with the dog.

10:19.285 --> 10:21.196
The tanker is blocking two lanes.

10:21.296 --> 10:21.555
Pop ]...

10:21.655 --> 10:24.210
...That's right, Brian.
All Manhattan-bound traffic...

10:24.310 --> 10:25.292
...is stuck right now--...

10:25.392 --> 10:28.778
Are they talking about the bridge?
- ��.

10:28.878 --> 10:31.002
Could you turn the music down, please?

10:31.102 --> 10:32.332
Yes, please. Thank you.

10:32.432 --> 10:34.383
...has jackknifed
on the Williamsburg Bridge.

10:34.483 --> 10:36.519
A few minutes ago,
the mayor made a statement...

10:36.619 --> 10:38.454
...  urging people to avoid all
but essential traveling--.

10:38.554 --> 10:40.757
I still don't hear anything.

10:40.857 --> 10:41.958
What? What?

10:42.058 --> 10:44.191
Did you forget your hearing aid?
Some tanker's...

10:44.291 --> 10:45.178
...stuck on the bridge.

10:45.278 --> 10:47.029
That's all I'm hearing.

10:47.129 --> 10:48.689
Now the mayor's telling
people not to come...

10:48.789 --> 10:49.483
...into the city tonight.

10:49.583 --> 10:51.267
Shouldn't we have taken the tunnel?

10:51.367 --> 10:53.703
Nah. No way.
Everything's a mess.

10:53.803 --> 10:55.938
Hey, uh,
what's with your dog?

10:56.038 --> 10:57.473
Actually,
we don't know.

10:57.573 --> 11:00.109
Maybe he ate a plastic bag.

11:00.209 --> 11:02.979
My dog did that once.
Yeah, he got real sick.

11:03.079 --> 11:05.363
Oh, I'm sorry.

11:13.372 --> 11:15.391
Okay, thank you.
There you go.

11:15.491 --> 11:18.551
Keep the change.
Oh, God. Here we go.

11:19.478 --> 11:21.816
Good luck with the dog.
You'll find out in the morning...

11:21.916 --> 11:22.583
...if she ate a bag.

11:22.683 --> 11:24.430
I got it, I got it.
You got it?

11:24.530 --> 11:24.885
Okay.

11:24.985 --> 11:26.014
You want me to carry her?

11:26.114 --> 11:26.853
No, no, I've got her.

11:26.953 --> 11:28.838
It's okay, sweetie.
We're almost there.

11:28.938 --> 11:31.574
Okay, sweetie-- Oh, my God.

11:31.674 --> 11:34.910
You all right?
Yeah, I'm all right.

11:35.010 --> 11:37.481
I found her on the kitchen floor
in her own urine, and when.

11:37.581 --> 11:38.865
I picked her up, she screamed.

11:38.965 --> 11:40.068
Do you know what I mean?

11:40.168 --> 11:40.867
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:40.967 --> 11:42.921
Okay, Dorothy,
let's see what's...

11:43.021 --> 11:43.937
...going on here.

11:44.037 --> 11:46.224
It's highly probable it's
a ruptured disk, but...

11:46.324 --> 11:47.774
...we'll need to do a CAT scan.

11:47.874 --> 11:49.492
CAT scan?
Yeah.

11:49.592 --> 11:51.961
- Is that expensive?
- Alex. Alex.

11:52.061 --> 11:53.596
I'm just asking,
Ruth.

11:53.696 --> 11:55.464
It's not cheap,
Mr. Carver.

11:55.564 --> 11:57.859
How much?
Uh, around $1,000.

11:57.867 --> 12:00.169
Oh.

12:00.269 --> 12:02.672
Okay.
Yeah, okay.

12:02.772 --> 12:04.874
We should do this right away.

12:04.974 --> 12:06.442
Yeah.
Fine.

12:06.542 --> 12:08.844
Good.
Okay.

12:08.944 --> 12:12.259
Okay, Dorothy.
It's okay. Okay, Dorothy.

12:20.873 --> 12:23.492
Do you really think they
can fix a ruptured disk?

12:23.592 --> 12:25.628
Who knows.

12:25.728 --> 12:27.917
We just have to be ready for the worst.

12:28.017 --> 12:29.316
Don't s-- Don't say that.

12:29.416 --> 12:30.966
Please, Alex.
She's 10 years old.

12:31.066 --> 12:33.969
I know.
But 10's not that old.

12:34.069 --> 12:36.706
You're older than her in dog years.

12:36.806 --> 12:39.742
Thanks.

12:39.842 --> 12:42.344
The rupture is between T13 and L1.

12:42.444 --> 12:44.847
It's about two-thirds down her spine.

12:44.947 --> 12:50.052
Usually, this type of injury
is best with, uh, surgery.

12:50.152 --> 12:52.388
What if you can't fix it?

12:52.488 --> 12:53.644
Well, animals adapt very well...

12:53.744 --> 12:54.474
...to new challenges.

12:54.574 --> 12:57.059
I've seen dogs with paralysis...

12:57.159 --> 13:00.096
...live a full life with the use of wheels.

13:00.196 --> 13:01.831
Wheels?
Yeah.

13:01.931 --> 13:04.166
But look, let's not get ahead of ourselves.

13:04.266 --> 13:06.501
We'll keep her on the steroids.
And in the meantime.

13:06.601 --> 13:07.487
you should go home.

13:07.587 --> 13:10.372
We'll call you in the morning.

13:10.472 --> 13:13.509
I wish we didn't have to
leave her overnight.

13:13.609 --> 13:15.745
Try not to put yourself in her place.

13:15.845 --> 13:18.914
Animals adapt to their fates
more easily than we do.

13:19.014 --> 13:20.539
They don't remember what was.

13:20.639 --> 13:20.867
Okay.

13:20.967 --> 13:24.286
They deal with things as they are now.

13:24.386 --> 13:27.289
Should we tell him how far
we're willing to go?

13:27.389 --> 13:29.558
What are you talking about?
What do you mean?

13:29.658 --> 13:31.990
I mean, we have to be realistic, Ruth.

13:32.090 --> 13:33.914
We can only spend so much.

13:34.014 --> 13:35.698
And you heard what the doctor said.

13:35.798 --> 13:36.883
Animals live in the now.

13:36.983 --> 13:39.159
And it might not even be fair to Dorothy.

13:39.259 --> 13:39.653
Uh-huh.

13:39.753 --> 13:41.211
You might want to consider this.

13:41.311 --> 13:41.855
Wait-- What?

13:41.955 --> 13:42.909
I'll call you tomorrow.

13:43.009 --> 13:43.857
Thank you, Doctor.

13:43.957 --> 13:45.594
I'm sorry,
but what is that?

13:45.694 --> 13:46.560
This is a DNR.

13:46.660 --> 13:48.717
Do Not Resuscitate.
Wh-- What are you t--.

13:48.817 --> 13:49.596
Wait a min-- Oh.

13:49.696 --> 13:51.447
Ruth.
No.

13:51.547 --> 13:53.749
Why did you sign that form?
We have to be...

13:53.849 --> 13:54.601
...practical, Ruth.

13:54.701 --> 13:57.009
But it's not your decision
to make. We have to do...

13:57.109 --> 13:58.338
...everything we can for her.

13:58.438 --> 14:00.275
And we will.
But what if there isn't...

14:00.375 --> 14:01.508
...anything we can do?

14:01.608 --> 14:03.959
There's always something to do, Alex.

14:04.059 --> 14:07.047
Just think it might be
the kindest thing for her.

14:07.147 --> 14:07.514
Yeah?

14:07.614 --> 14:10.152
Let me ask you this.
Why do you always assume...

14:10.252 --> 14:11.885
...everything is gonna go wrong?

14:11.985 --> 14:15.070
Because I plan for the worst
and I hope for the best.

14:15.170 --> 14:17.761
You think I don't know that
after 40 years of marriage?

14:17.861 --> 14:18.592
For Pete's sake.

14:18.692 --> 14:20.704
We've had this same damn discussion...

14:20.804 --> 14:21.895
...for a thousand times.

14:21.995 --> 14:23.685
Don't tell me that.
It's not a discussion.

14:23.785 --> 14:24.931
This is an argument, Alex.

14:25.031 --> 14:26.874
Argument, discussion,
whatever you want to call it.

14:26.974 --> 14:28.034
I'm doing what I think is right.

14:28.134 --> 14:30.186
Okay, fine.
All right. You do that.

14:30.286 --> 14:33.491
But it doesn't matter,
because I'm sure...

14:33.591 --> 14:36.311
...that Dorothy's gonna be fine.

14:51.757 --> 14:53.457
Woman ] There has been no movement...

14:53.557 --> 14:54.060
...at this point.

14:54.160 --> 14:56.178
The driver appears to be missing.

14:56.278 --> 14:58.848
The NYPD, well, they're not
saying very much, but--.

14:58.948 --> 15:01.173
Woman #2 ] NYPD has
released the identity...

15:01.273 --> 15:02.836
...of the suspect as Abdul Pamir.

15:02.936 --> 15:05.077
We know who he is, but
the real questions are--.

15:05.177 --> 15:05.739
Where is he?

15:05.839 --> 15:08.324
What is he up to?
And why did he run away?

15:08.424 --> 15:10.659
Did you take your pill?

15:10.759 --> 15:13.562
- Yes, love.
- Mm-hmm.

15:13.662 --> 15:15.464
Man ] Thanks, Julie.

15:15.564 --> 15:17.461
I've spoken with people
who were on the bridge...

15:17.561 --> 15:18.652
...when the tanker jackknifed,

15:18.752 --> 15:20.417
and they said their immediate concern...

15:20.517 --> 15:21.354
...was that the crash--.

15:21.454 --> 15:23.639
I'm going up to the roof.

15:23.739 --> 15:26.457
Okay.

15:40.473 --> 15:43.225
See what I'm saying?
Larry. Stop.

15:43.325 --> 15:44.727
Happy retirement.

15:44.827 --> 15:46.495
Thanks for nothing.

15:46.595 --> 15:50.266
Yeah. Wishful thinking.
Oh, my God.

15:50.366 --> 15:51.754
�� What are you doing,

15:51.854 --> 15:52.185
honey?

15:52.285 --> 15:55.371
What is it? Oh, God.
What is it gonna be?

15:55.471 --> 15:57.706
Thank you very much.
I love you.

15:57.806 --> 15:59.406
Uh-oh.
That feels a little--.

15:59.506 --> 15:59.793
Wait.

15:59.893 --> 16:01.920
There's something
strange about this. I don't...

16:02.020 --> 16:03.029
...know what's going on.

16:03.129 --> 16:05.781
Oh, no. It is.
It's trouble.

16:05.881 --> 16:08.851
It's trouble.
It's trouble.

16:08.951 --> 16:10.753
Aah.

16:10.853 --> 16:12.853
This is the trouble.

16:12.855 --> 16:14.690
Oh, you're adorable.

16:14.790 --> 16:17.226
What are we gonna name her?

16:17.326 --> 16:19.428
What do you think?
I got it. I know what.

16:19.528 --> 16:21.397
Dorothy. Yeah.

16:21.497 --> 16:23.032
Dorothy.

16:23.132 --> 16:25.307
You're not in Kansas anymore, Dorothy.

16:25.407 --> 16:26.419
Look. Oh, my God.

16:26.519 --> 16:29.041
Thank you so much.
I love you.

16:29.141 --> 16:31.141
I love you too.

16:31.757 --> 16:34.109
I thought you were
watching the news, honey.

16:34.209 --> 16:36.674
Nothing 'new' about it.
It's all the same old stuff...

16:36.774 --> 16:37.497
...over and over.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.462
I know. But I think people feel safer...

16:39.562 --> 16:40.767
...when they hear things.

16:40.867 --> 16:43.752
What do you think?

16:43.852 --> 16:46.889
Well, they're kind of puny,
but we got tomatoes.

16:46.989 --> 16:48.508
How many did we get last year?

16:48.608 --> 16:49.175
Six? Seven?

16:49.275 --> 16:50.960
Eight.
Eight?

16:51.060 --> 16:53.662
Well, that works out to be
about $9.00 apiece.

16:53.762 --> 16:57.110
We could have gone to the Four Seasons...

16:57.210 --> 16:58.852
...for less than that.

16:58.952 --> 17:00.603
I'm gonna go clean up.
Okay?

17:00.703 --> 17:02.255
We can clean up tomorrow.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.573
The people are coming tomorrow at 9:00,

17:04.673 --> 17:08.325
and Lily has given me a whole list of stuff...

17:08.425 --> 17:10.425
...that I have to do.

17:17.836 --> 17:20.090
Nobody is going to be
house hunting tomorrow.

17:20.191 --> 17:21.107
We don't know that.

17:21.207 --> 17:23.459
Would you buy an apartment
this weekend?

17:23.559 --> 17:26.369
You're as happy as you can be
about all this bridge business.

17:26.470 --> 17:26.946
aren't you?

17:27.047 --> 17:29.047
Well, of course.

17:29.098 --> 17:31.045
I planned this whole thing
just so I could thwart Lily's...

17:31.145 --> 17:31.952
...open house tomorrow.

17:32.052 --> 17:34.169
I wouldn't put it past you.

17:34.269 --> 17:35.714
Oh, don't forget,
you promised Lily...

17:35.814 --> 17:36.957
...you'd clean up your studio.

17:37.057 --> 17:40.042
It looks like a mess, Alex.

17:40.142 --> 17:42.274
Bomb detection unit is
being brought on the scene...

17:42.374 --> 17:42.896
...with robots...

17:42.996 --> 17:44.616
... to check for such explosives...

17:44.716 --> 17:45.332
...in the tanker.

17:45.432 --> 17:47.549
Now the bridge is swarming with NYPD.

17:47.649 --> 17:48.649
Hello.

17:48.749 --> 17:50.452
We have unconfirmed reports
 that there may be......

17:50.552 --> 17:52.023
... some sort of explosive device--.

17:52.123 --> 17:52.405
It's Lily.

17:52.505 --> 17:54.623
So what about this bridge business?

17:54.723 --> 17:57.874
Please, Aunt Ruth.
I closed on a loft in Tribeca...

17:57.974 --> 17:59.179
...the day after 9/11.

17:59.279 --> 18:01.330
We might not get the usual hordes,

18:01.430 --> 18:03.532
but we'll get the serious ones,
and that'll work in our favor.

18:03.632 --> 18:05.501
I will see you tomorrow at 8:30.

18:05.601 --> 18:07.236
Good. Okay.
Thank you.

18:07.336 --> 18:09.142
Woman ] Has identified the missing...

18:09.242 --> 18:10.357
...driver as Abdul Pamir.

18:10.457 --> 18:12.427
Now we can show you
a picture from Pamir's...

18:12.527 --> 18:13.493
...social networking site.

18:13.593 --> 18:15.844
Isn't that a traditional
Muslim hat he's wearing?

18:15.944 --> 18:16.282
Yeah, Brian.

18:16.382 --> 18:18.080
It's actually referred
to as a kufi. ...

18:18.180 --> 18:20.041
... Lily's coming by with the first couple...

18:20.141 --> 18:20.433
...at 8:30.

18:20.533 --> 18:21.620
Man ]...of Pamir's.

18:21.720 --> 18:22.502
Islamic faith.

18:22.602 --> 18:25.187
Nothing stands in the way of real estate.

18:25.287 --> 18:28.356
If you see something,
say something.

18:28.456 --> 18:31.006
Absolutely. Vigilance is the--.

18:33.979 --> 18:36.765
What did Lily call this?

18:36.865 --> 18:39.201
Clutter.

18:39.301 --> 18:41.503
Who'd have thought that
the whole of my life's work...

18:41.603 --> 18:45.858
...would be worth less than
the room I painted it in.

18:45.958 --> 18:49.745
But how can I turn down a million dollars?

18:49.845 --> 18:52.096
I have nothing else to leave Ruth...

18:52.196 --> 18:53.333
...besides all this...

18:53.433 --> 18:55.433
...clutter.

18:57.337 --> 18:59.788
Oh, come on.

18:59.888 --> 19:02.740
�� Okay. Oh. There.

19:04.911 --> 19:06.849
Yes? Yes? Oh.
Hello, Doctor.

19:06.949 --> 19:08.014
Yes, this is she.

19:08.114 --> 19:10.155
Dorothy's stabilized,
so I'd like to operate on her...

19:10.255 --> 19:11.384
...first thing in the morning...

19:11.484 --> 19:13.102
... to minimize distress.

19:13.202 --> 19:14.870
Honey?
Yeah.

19:14.970 --> 19:17.087
The doctor wants to operate on her...

19:17.187 --> 19:18.324
...tomorrow morning.

19:18.424 --> 19:20.465
Yeah, now,
she has a heart murmur,

19:20.565 --> 19:21.194
so I would--...

19:21.294 --> 19:25.214
...       Yes. Yes. I see.
Yes, of course.

19:25.314 --> 19:27.841
He says the longer we wait,
the more stress there is...

19:27.941 --> 19:28.535
...on her heart.

19:28.635 --> 19:30.823
What are the odds if they operate?

19:30.923 --> 19:32.105
What are her odds?

19:32.205 --> 19:34.490
Around 60-40.
60-40.

19:34.590 --> 19:37.126
In her favor?
In her favor?

19:37.226 --> 19:41.130
No, there's no guarantees,
but one can't be certain.

19:41.230 --> 19:44.066
Oh. Yes.

19:44.166 --> 19:47.469
So, do you want to go ahead with this?

19:47.569 --> 19:50.472
Well, yes, we do.
Um--...

19:50.572 --> 19:52.763
...I-I should tell you the operation...

19:52.863 --> 19:54.360
...will be at least $10,000.

19:54.460 --> 19:56.845
$10,000?
Yes.

19:56.945 --> 19:58.959
Oh. Well, that's a lot of money.

19:59.059 --> 20:00.266
Let me talk to him.

20:00.366 --> 20:02.518
Oh-- Okay.
I'm sorry?

20:02.618 --> 20:05.420
Uh, Doctor?
This is Mr. Carver.

20:05.520 --> 20:07.656
Hello? H-- Hello?

20:07.756 --> 20:09.625
What's the matter?
Doesn't work. Hello?

20:09.725 --> 20:11.326
Wait-- Oh.
Is anyone there?

20:11.426 --> 20:13.694
Doctor,
this is Mr. Carver.

20:13.794 --> 20:14.096
Yes.

20:14.196 --> 20:16.519
Listen. I want you to do
whatever is necessary...

20:16.619 --> 20:17.417
...to save Dorothy.

20:17.517 --> 20:19.101
Never mind what I signed.

20:19.201 --> 20:20.542
The money doesn't matter.

20:20.642 --> 20:20.887
Okay.

20:20.987 --> 20:23.215
Just do whatever it takes.

20:23.315 --> 20:25.315
Will do.

20:28.760 --> 20:30.760
What?

20:31.763 --> 20:34.031
You know what.

20:36.035 --> 20:39.270
Aww. Aww.

20:49.214 --> 20:52.072
It's a brand-new day
here at WZRZ, your place...

20:52.172 --> 20:53.253
...for New York talk.

20:53.353 --> 20:56.405
Traffic is still snarled up
on the Williamsburg Bridge.

20:56.505 --> 20:59.308
We'll go out there
with Cynthia Piermont soon.

20:59.408 --> 21:02.377
But first, we have a studio
full of newlyweds.

21:02.477 --> 21:05.376
We're learning
that the suspect, Abdul Pamir.

21:05.476 --> 21:06.699
is from Uzbekistan.

21:06.799 --> 21:09.218
Hey.

21:09.318 --> 21:11.456
Hi.
Look at that.

21:11.556 --> 21:12.387
What?

21:12.487 --> 21:15.057
'Peril on the bridge.'

21:15.157 --> 21:17.452
They make it sound like
an amusement park ride...

21:17.552 --> 21:18.178
...or something.

21:18.278 --> 21:20.395
Oh.

21:20.495 --> 21:23.265
Several of Pamir's co-workers
have come forward to say...

21:23.365 --> 21:26.001
...that he's a quiet,
good-natured young man.

21:26.101 --> 21:28.370
Who's screwing up
the real estate market.

21:28.470 --> 21:30.558
We're going now to Queens
where the family is...

21:30.658 --> 21:31.858
...about to make a statement.

21:31.958 --> 21:34.543
Logan is reporting live from the scene.

21:34.643 --> 21:37.613
Abdul Pamir is a devout,
gentle and caring son.

21:37.713 --> 21:40.048
Yes, he was born in Uzbekistan,

21:40.148 --> 21:42.855
but he became a proud American citizen...

21:42.955 --> 21:43.903
...two years ago.

21:44.003 --> 21:47.956
All we want is for him to come home safe.

21:48.056 --> 21:49.867
Hello.
This is Dr. Kramer.

21:49.967 --> 21:50.843
Mrs. Carver.

21:50.943 --> 21:53.228
Oh, Dr. Kramer.
Uh-- Honey, honey.

21:53.328 --> 21:55.464
Hmm?
It's Dr. Kramer.

21:55.564 --> 21:57.417
The good news is Dorothy made it...

21:57.517 --> 21:58.851
...through the surgery fine.

21:58.951 --> 22:02.776
But when she was waking up,
she had a seizure.

22:02.804 --> 22:04.439
A wh-- A seizure?

22:04.539 --> 22:06.569
It concerns me.
You have to keep in mind...

22:06.669 --> 22:07.560
...she's not a puppy.

22:07.660 --> 22:11.580
The anesthesia should wear off
in the next couple of hours,

22:11.680 --> 22:14.716
and I'll call you
as soon as I know anything.

22:14.816 --> 22:16.652
Thank you, Doctor.

22:16.752 --> 22:18.887
That's not good news.

22:18.987 --> 22:21.070
Okay. Turn off the TV.
Shit. I-I don't want...

22:21.170 --> 22:21.774
...to see them.

22:21.874 --> 22:23.874
Then go hide.

22:27.646 --> 22:29.297
Good morning.
Hello. Good morning.

22:29.397 --> 22:30.516
These are the Schuylers.

22:30.616 --> 22:32.375
This is Mrs. Carver.
Oh, please.

22:32.475 --> 22:33.219
Call me Ruth.

22:33.319 --> 22:35.175
Ruth, I'm Jenny.
It's good to see you.

22:35.275 --> 22:35.855
Come on in.

22:35.955 --> 22:37.806
Where's Dorothy?

22:37.906 --> 22:40.727
Well, she's recovering from surgery and--.

22:40.827 --> 22:41.027
Oh.

22:41.127 --> 22:45.122
You know, you can have pets.
- We don't do pets.

22:46.064 --> 22:50.909
So, do you see how the hallway
expands the sense of space?

22:50.919 --> 22:52.854
And look at the size of the kitchen.

22:52.954 --> 22:56.425
You've got light
coming from both directions.

22:56.525 --> 22:58.460
You practically have to wear sunglasses...

22:58.560 --> 23:01.797
...when you have breakfast
in here, it's so bright.

23:01.897 --> 23:03.220
The master bedroom is this way.

23:03.320 --> 23:03.616
'Master.'

23:03.716 --> 23:06.201
Hello.
Yeah.

23:06.301 --> 23:09.838
We're looking at some place.
Reminds me of my grandmother's.

23:09.938 --> 23:12.022
I know. Who's gonna buy a place
with the shit that's...

23:12.122 --> 23:13.092
...going on out there now?

23:13.192 --> 23:15.210
So this is the laundry room.

23:15.310 --> 23:17.578
And this is a really large...

23:17.678 --> 23:18.613
...hall closet.

23:18.713 --> 23:21.283
I love the plank floors.

23:21.383 --> 23:23.043
I always hated the parquet floors...

23:23.143 --> 23:24.270
...in our East Side place.

23:24.370 --> 23:26.445
Who came up with the idea
of parquet anyway?

23:26.545 --> 23:27.073
I don't know.

23:27.173 --> 23:28.823
It's like walking on a board game.

23:28.923 --> 23:29.242
I know.

23:29.342 --> 23:30.625
This is the bathroom.

23:30.725 --> 23:31.311
Only one?

23:31.411 --> 23:33.161
I told you that,
honey.

23:33.261 --> 23:34.663
Jesus.

23:34.763 --> 23:36.398
Yeah.
I'm listening.

23:36.498 --> 23:39.167
The second bedroom.
- Sorry.

23:39.267 --> 23:40.902
Uh, hello.

23:41.002 --> 23:43.004
Oh, this is my husband's studio.

23:43.104 --> 23:45.352
And I'm her husband in his studio.

23:45.452 --> 23:46.492
How do you do?

23:46.592 --> 23:48.243
Yeah,
hold on a second.

23:48.343 --> 23:50.215
Oh, isn't this an amazing view, honey?

23:50.315 --> 23:51.030
Yeah, it's good.

23:51.130 --> 23:54.700
It could be a nursery.
Or a screening room.

23:54.749 --> 23:56.848
She's right, honey.
There'd be a lot of room in here...

23:56.948 --> 23:58.137
...once we got all this stuff out.

23:58.237 --> 24:00.482
No, I told you we weren't doing that.

24:00.582 --> 24:02.308
Does anybody listen to me?

24:02.408 --> 24:04.326
My husband is in the financial sector.

24:04.426 --> 24:05.994
Oh.
Was. Is.

24:06.094 --> 24:08.930
W-We've had a rough couple of years.

24:09.030 --> 24:11.233
That's why we had to
sell our duplex uptown.

24:11.333 --> 24:13.402
I-It's all right.

24:13.502 --> 24:15.622
'Cause our therapist
says we need to lower...

24:15.722 --> 24:16.556
...our expectations.

24:16.656 --> 24:18.840
She said i-it'll be healthy for us.

24:18.940 --> 24:21.009
Good karma to live in a place like this.

24:21.109 --> 24:23.003
Because we don't-- we don't really need...

24:23.103 --> 24:23.730
...all that much.

24:23.830 --> 24:26.415
- I mean, who does? Right?
- Right.

24:26.515 --> 24:30.070
You could always go
live in a cardboard box...

24:30.170 --> 24:32.170
...under the bridge.

24:34.272 --> 24:37.259
This street is very sought-after.

24:37.359 --> 24:38.946
Thank you for letting us see it first.

24:39.046 --> 24:40.146
Oh, please. My pleasure.

24:40.246 --> 24:41.649
Shall I show you out?

24:41.749 --> 24:42.081
Okay.

24:42.181 --> 24:43.504
Thanks.
Bye.

24:43.604 --> 24:44.433
All right.

24:44.533 --> 24:46.902
Okay.

24:47.002 --> 24:48.637
That was a good start.

24:48.737 --> 24:51.039
Yeah, well, the others
are gonna be better.

24:51.139 --> 24:53.141
Couldn't be worse.

24:53.241 --> 24:55.911
Honey.

24:56.011 --> 24:58.381
So, there's good news
and there's bad news.

24:58.481 --> 24:59.481
Okay.

24:59.581 --> 25:01.541
Um, they liked the apartment.

25:01.641 --> 25:01.834
Oh.

25:01.934 --> 25:03.561
Or at least she does,
which is usually...

25:03.661 --> 25:04.237
...what matters.

25:04.337 --> 25:05.770
They love the neighborhood.

25:05.870 --> 25:06.339
Mm-hmm.

25:06.439 --> 25:08.648
But they're a little worried
about the stuff on the bridge.

25:08.748 --> 25:09.876
It's gonna be over in a week.

25:09.976 --> 25:12.250
That's what I told them, but
they said if it happens once--.

25:12.350 --> 25:13.079
Woman Speaking ].

25:13.179 --> 25:14.896
What's happening?

25:14.996 --> 25:17.152
...has now confirmed
that there is no bomb...

25:17.252 --> 25:17.884
...in the tanker.

25:17.984 --> 25:20.173
However, police have
not yet ruled out the idea...

25:20.273 --> 25:21.754
...that the suspect may be armed.

25:21.854 --> 25:23.915
Are they still saying this guy's a terrorist?

25:24.015 --> 25:25.124
They don't really know.

25:25.224 --> 25:27.442
If you see something,
say something.

25:27.542 --> 25:30.602
Today on this day,
years after 9/11--.

25:30.679 --> 25:32.696
Next couple.

25:33.832 --> 25:36.618
Hi.
Come on up.

25:36.718 --> 25:38.854
Does he have a device with him?

25:38.954 --> 25:41.189
Is he wearing a suicide vest?

25:41.289 --> 25:43.189
We, of course, have more
questions than answers.

25:43.289 --> 25:43.476
Great.

25:43.576 --> 25:45.293
My God.

25:45.393 --> 25:48.163
Nothing is being ruled out
until they find the suspect.

25:48.263 --> 25:51.766
Of course, we can't confirm
if there is actually a bomb.

25:51.866 --> 25:54.155
Then why keep talking about it?
- 'Cause they make shit up...

25:54.255 --> 25:55.388
...as they go along. That's why.

25:55.488 --> 25:58.340
Ah. There they are.

25:58.440 --> 26:00.675
Coming,
coming, coming.

26:00.775 --> 26:02.775
Okay, here we go.

26:04.162 --> 26:06.008
Good news.
There is no bomb...

26:06.108 --> 26:06.899
...in the tanker.

26:06.999 --> 26:08.234
They catch the driver?

26:08.334 --> 26:08.935
No, not yet.

26:09.035 --> 26:10.785
Mrs. Carver.
Oh, hi.

26:10.885 --> 26:12.728
And what's the name of your dog?

26:12.828 --> 26:13.172
Harold.

26:13.272 --> 26:14.583
Can I pet Harold?
- No, no, no.

26:14.683 --> 26:15.608
He's wearing the vest.

26:15.708 --> 26:16.865
Sorry.
He's in training...

26:16.965 --> 26:18.244
...to be a seeing-eye dog.

26:18.344 --> 26:19.910
He's still learning the difference...

26:20.010 --> 26:21.180
...between work and play.

26:21.280 --> 26:22.591
Oh, Mrs. Carver,
I'm Annie.

26:22.691 --> 26:23.316
Annie Meyer.

26:23.416 --> 26:26.136
Hello. Well, yeah,
we have a dog.

26:26.234 --> 26:27.948
He's not here now.
No. She's in the hospital.

26:28.048 --> 26:29.255
She's recovering from surgery.

26:29.355 --> 26:31.820
Hey, stop, Harold.
Heel. Heel.

26:31.840 --> 26:32.896
Heel. Heel.
He must be...

26:32.996 --> 26:33.826
...smelling our dog.

26:33.926 --> 26:35.412
Even so, he shouldn't be doing that.

26:35.512 --> 26:36.496
Oh, he's young, Millicent.

26:36.596 --> 26:38.833
Remember that next time
he drags you under a truck.

26:38.933 --> 26:39.332
No-- Okay.

26:39.432 --> 26:41.816
Isn't this an amazing kitchen?

26:41.916 --> 26:43.933
Look at all the cabinet space.

26:44.033 --> 26:44.604
the light.

26:44.704 --> 26:47.059
When you have breakfast in here,
you're gonna practically...

26:47.159 --> 26:48.174
...have to wear sunglasses.

26:48.274 --> 26:49.400
Am I right?
Maybe.

26:49.500 --> 26:50.276
I don't know.

26:50.376 --> 26:54.663
Let's go to the living room.
It's right through here.

26:54.763 --> 26:56.653
Don't touch the dog.
I'm sorry.

26:56.753 --> 26:57.316
I'm sorry.

26:57.416 --> 27:00.869
This is the living room.
Again, you see amazing light.

27:00.969 --> 27:02.704
Oh, yes,
it's beautiful.

27:02.804 --> 27:04.369
And here is what I think is the--.

27:04.469 --> 27:05.224
Oh. Hello there.

27:05.324 --> 27:07.909
Oh, no, no, no. Harold.
No, Harold.

27:08.009 --> 27:10.679
I'm so sorry.
- He's not fully trained yet.

27:10.779 --> 27:12.213
Oh, wow.
What a great room.

27:12.313 --> 27:14.015
Isn't it?
Thank you.

27:14.115 --> 27:15.710
Harold, off.
Leave the paintings alone.

27:15.810 --> 27:16.669
No, no, he's all right.

27:16.769 --> 27:18.553
He might buy something.

27:18.653 --> 27:21.423
Would you like to see the bedroom?

27:21.523 --> 27:23.224
Okay.
It's through here.

27:23.324 --> 27:25.324
Oh, that one is lovely.

27:25.393 --> 27:26.524
Are you okay?
Ye-- Oh.

27:26.624 --> 27:27.246
Oops. Sorry.

27:27.346 --> 27:29.346
Sorry. Oh, sorry.

27:29.364 --> 27:31.364
Everybody's a critic.

27:35.086 --> 27:38.206
What do you think?
I've seen better.

27:38.306 --> 27:40.385
Are you interested in buying?

27:40.485 --> 27:41.394
Me? God, no.

27:41.494 --> 27:44.446
I just like to look.
I go to all the open houses.

27:44.546 --> 27:46.458
I'm writing a book about them.

27:46.558 --> 27:46.999
A book.

27:47.099 --> 27:50.085
There you go.
- Thanks for coming.

27:50.185 --> 27:52.621
People are very interested.

27:52.721 --> 27:54.206
Are you sure about that?

27:54.306 --> 27:54.941
Yeah, I am.

27:55.041 --> 27:56.765
Man ] The search for Abdul Pamir...

27:56.865 --> 27:57.743
...is still under way.

27:57.843 --> 28:00.345
There have been a number
of unconfirmed sightings...

28:00.445 --> 28:01.514
...and cell phone photos,

28:01.614 --> 28:03.765
but he's still out there somewhere.

28:03.865 --> 28:05.967
More good news from
the bridge though, Brian.

28:06.067 --> 28:07.718
The tanker itself has been moved...

28:07.818 --> 28:08.955
...and all lanes reopened.

28:09.055 --> 28:11.506
- Excuse me.
- Hmm?

28:11.606 --> 28:13.606
Excuse me.

28:14.693 --> 28:16.277
Excuse me.

28:16.377 --> 28:19.029
Man, Woman Continue Speaking ].

28:20.632 --> 28:22.344
Please don't do that,
sweetheart.

28:22.444 --> 28:23.603
You're gonna break it.

28:23.703 --> 28:26.245
We don't say 'no' to Justin.
Well, I can say 'no'

28:26.345 --> 28:27.273
to him if you like.

28:27.373 --> 28:30.425
We prefer to explain things to him.

28:30.525 --> 28:34.197
Justin, do you know why
it's inappropriate...

28:34.297 --> 28:36.648
...to flick the switch like that?

28:36.748 --> 28:38.433
I don't give a shit.

28:38.533 --> 28:40.335
Adorable.

28:40.435 --> 28:42.435
Thank you.

28:45.890 --> 28:48.476
Replace the French doors with glass.

28:48.576 --> 28:50.945
The crown moldings have to go.

28:51.045 --> 28:53.687
And see if the beams are decorative...

28:53.787 --> 28:55.334
...or actually structural.

28:55.434 --> 28:57.410
Oh, can you tell me
if the building association...

28:57.510 --> 28:58.771
...will let me see patients here?

28:58.871 --> 29:01.322
- What kind of patients?
- I'm a psychotherapist.

29:01.422 --> 29:04.057
You've come to the right place.

29:05.044 --> 29:08.063
And, uh, this wall.
What does this wall do?

29:08.163 --> 29:09.731
Hold up the ceiling maybe?

29:09.831 --> 29:11.566
Thanks.

29:11.666 --> 29:13.952
See if we can take down this bedroom wall,

29:14.052 --> 29:14.854
open it up a bit.

29:14.954 --> 29:16.971
God knows it needs it.

29:17.071 --> 29:19.376
Double-pane the windows.
Make sure they get...

29:19.476 --> 29:20.359
...rid of all this crap.

29:20.459 --> 29:22.177
Excuse me.
Oh. Yes?

29:22.277 --> 29:24.375
The tub in the bathroom.
What's the deal...

29:24.475 --> 29:25.131
...with the tub?

29:25.231 --> 29:27.174
Oh, well, my husband and I,
we were at Brentfield...

29:27.274 --> 29:28.267
...and we saw this antique--.

29:28.367 --> 29:30.856
Thanks.
Make sure that Roberto can...

29:30.956 --> 29:32.371
...take out the fixtures.

29:32.471 --> 29:35.105
Put in all-new fixtures.

29:38.476 --> 29:41.034
Man ] Likely get an update
from the mayor's office...

29:41.134 --> 29:42.114
...later this afternoon.

29:42.214 --> 29:43.998
This came off.
Oh.

29:44.098 --> 29:46.234
Well... thanks.

29:46.334 --> 29:48.404
Hope you're keeping an eye on things.

29:48.504 --> 29:48.888
I guess.

29:48.988 --> 29:50.877
I wish they would turn that TV off.

29:50.977 --> 29:52.358
I told them twice already.

29:52.458 --> 29:54.201
Maybe we should make popcorn.

29:54.301 --> 29:55.528
I don't know about that.

29:55.628 --> 29:57.932
Excuse me.
Did you paint the bathroom...

29:58.032 --> 29:58.631
...that color?

29:58.731 --> 30:00.615
Uh, no.

30:00.715 --> 30:02.417
We were out one night
and someone broke in...

30:02.517 --> 30:03.502
...and painted the bathroom.

30:03.602 --> 30:06.121
Is there a lot of crime
in this neighborhood?

30:06.221 --> 30:07.724
Did you notice that there's a window...

30:07.824 --> 30:08.507
...in the bathroom?

30:08.607 --> 30:10.625
It's really particularly nice.
- Come take a look.

30:10.725 --> 30:12.551
What are you doing?
Nothing.

30:12.651 --> 30:13.145
Nothing.

30:13.245 --> 30:15.764
I think you should see
about how Dorothy's doing.

30:15.864 --> 30:16.182
No, no.

30:16.282 --> 30:19.380
The doctor said he would call as soon...

30:19.480 --> 30:21.480
...as he knew anything.

30:22.987 --> 30:24.987
Uh, excuse me.
Oh, yes?

30:25.006 --> 30:27.609
Can I grow plants on the fire escape?

30:27.709 --> 30:30.078
There's a roof.
Really?

30:30.178 --> 30:31.922
And my husband grows plants up there.

30:32.022 --> 30:32.398
Does he?

30:32.498 --> 30:34.282
Good for him.

30:34.382 --> 30:36.718
I grow mine for medicinal reasons.

30:36.818 --> 30:39.036
Oh.

30:42.640 --> 30:44.993
Oh, hi.
I hope you don't mind.

30:45.093 --> 30:47.061
I have to lie down in a bedroom...

30:47.161 --> 30:49.564
...before I know what it's like to sleep in it.

30:49.664 --> 30:51.502
This is the position
I'm gonna be in the most...

30:51.602 --> 30:52.218
...in here, isn't it?

30:52.318 --> 30:54.269
I suppose so.
- Oh, my God.

30:54.369 --> 30:56.237
This is an awesome apartment.

30:56.337 --> 30:58.337
We like it.

31:04.362 --> 31:07.128
Would you mind turning off that light?

31:07.228 --> 31:07.700
No. No.

31:07.800 --> 31:09.800
Thank you.

31:16.407 --> 31:19.794
They make a lot of noise,
don't they?

31:19.894 --> 31:21.963
Well, not usually.

31:22.063 --> 31:23.965
How long have you lived here?

31:24.065 --> 31:26.065
40 years.

31:26.351 --> 31:28.351
Wow.

31:28.853 --> 31:30.853
40 years.

31:43.167 --> 31:45.167
That's an awesome view.

31:47.038 --> 31:49.038
Yeah.

31:49.874 --> 31:51.960
Yeah.

31:52.060 --> 31:54.060
Yeah, we like it.

31:55.613 --> 31:58.066
- You looking to buy?
- My mother is.

31:58.166 --> 32:00.335
And which one is she?

32:00.435 --> 32:03.571
She's probably lying down
on your bed right now.

32:03.671 --> 32:05.671
Really?
She always...

32:05.767 --> 32:06.741
...does that.

32:06.841 --> 32:09.646
But don't worry.
She won't buy it.

32:09.677 --> 32:11.168
Oh?
We don't have...

32:11.268 --> 32:12.146
...any money.

32:12.246 --> 32:13.815
Oh, I see.

32:13.915 --> 32:16.099
Why are you selling it?

32:20.038 --> 32:22.038
That's a good question.

32:27.045 --> 32:29.397
- You have a dog?
- Yeah.

32:29.497 --> 32:31.332
She's in the hospital right now.

32:31.432 --> 32:33.617
What's happened?

32:35.119 --> 32:37.119
She's just old.

32:40.591 --> 32:42.243
What's your name?

32:42.343 --> 32:43.678
Zoe.

32:43.778 --> 32:45.213
Zoe?
Mm-hmm.

32:45.313 --> 32:47.313
Pretty.

32:48.466 --> 32:50.466
What's this?

32:54.273 --> 32:56.457
This, Zoe--.

32:56.557 --> 32:59.727
It's called a turntable,

32:59.827 --> 33:04.299
and it's used to play records.

33:04.399 --> 33:07.969
These records are called LP's.

33:08.069 --> 33:11.054
Stands for 'long-playing.'

33:12.924 --> 33:15.877
The way it works is,
you take this stylus--.

33:15.977 --> 33:17.812
There's a little needle in there--...

33:17.912 --> 33:20.281
...and very carefully place it on the record.

33:20.381 --> 33:24.619
��...

33:24.719 --> 33:26.988
...� Have I told you lately �...

33:27.088 --> 33:29.940
...� That I love you? �...

33:31.776 --> 33:34.662
... - I like this song.
- So do I.

33:34.762 --> 33:37.565
��...

33:37.665 --> 33:39.300
...   Who's this?

33:39.400 --> 33:42.470
� Fill my heart with gladness �...

33:42.570 --> 33:44.405
...  � Take away my sadness �
That's my wife.

33:44.505 --> 33:46.505
I like her glasses.

33:46.574 --> 33:48.343
� Ease my troubles
That's what you do ��.

33:48.443 --> 33:51.248
They were all the rage back then.

33:52.830 --> 33:55.283
How much does the school
pay you to model?

33:55.383 --> 33:58.619
Um, five dollars.

33:58.719 --> 34:01.489
Well, 10 if it's more than three hours.

34:01.589 --> 34:04.158
So take your time.

34:04.258 --> 34:06.361
I could use the money.

34:06.461 --> 34:09.697
I'm not going anywhere.
Not dressed like this anyway.

34:09.797 --> 34:12.716
��...

34:15.186 --> 34:17.186
...   You a vet?

34:18.322 --> 34:20.108
Yeah.

34:20.208 --> 34:21.876
Vietnam?

34:21.976 --> 34:24.522
I-I don't like to talk politics or religion...

34:24.621 --> 34:25.496
...in the studio.

34:25.597 --> 34:27.782
Oh, my God.

34:27.882 --> 34:31.134
In my family politics is a religion.

34:32.503 --> 34:34.822
You ready?

34:34.922 --> 34:39.597
Wait. I-- I wanna do something
different with you first.

34:39.877 --> 34:42.196
Should I call the cops?

34:42.295 --> 34:44.632
How long have you had those glasses?

34:44.732 --> 34:46.567
Oh, these?
I-- I don't know.

34:46.667 --> 34:48.668
Since I was a girl.

34:48.768 --> 34:50.204
Here.
Put these on.

34:50.304 --> 34:52.907
No.
Why not?

34:53.007 --> 34:54.692
Well, for one thing,
I won't be able...

34:54.792 --> 34:55.828
...to see through them.

34:55.928 --> 34:58.449
Well, I'm the only person
in the room who needs...

34:58.549 --> 34:59.364
...to see anything.

34:59.464 --> 35:01.549
Yes, sir.

35:01.649 --> 35:04.284
Take yours off.
Give them to me.

35:04.769 --> 35:06.854
You're the first man I ever met...

35:06.954 --> 35:09.313
...who is more interested
in getting my glasses off me...

35:09.413 --> 35:10.109
...than my clothes.

35:10.209 --> 35:12.209
Give them to me.

35:17.582 --> 35:19.582
Take 'em yourself.

35:38.102 --> 35:40.203
Very cool.

35:41.439 --> 35:44.244
That's the woman I want to paint.

35:48.813 --> 35:50.865
Why did you pick me?

35:50.965 --> 35:53.734
What do you mean?

35:53.834 --> 35:55.870
You know what I mean.

35:55.970 --> 35:58.372
Out of the modeling pool.
Why did you choose me?

35:58.472 --> 35:59.854
'Cause Camille is much prettier...

35:59.954 --> 36:00.359
...than I am.

36:00.459 --> 36:02.234
Everybody picks her because, God,

36:02.334 --> 36:03.062
she's beautiful.

36:03.162 --> 36:05.146
Beauty's not what I'm after.

36:05.246 --> 36:07.248
Oh.
Well, that's a relief.

36:07.348 --> 36:10.384
No. I mean it's not
the most important thing.

36:10.484 --> 36:13.703
- So, what is?
- You're real.

36:15.273 --> 36:17.273
Good answer.

36:20.945 --> 36:24.247
Start painting.
You got three hours.

36:37.996 --> 36:40.461
Thanks so much. And again,
my number is on the sheet...

36:40.561 --> 36:41.700
...if you have any questions.

36:41.800 --> 36:43.918
Thank you.
Thanks.

36:44.018 --> 36:45.395
That was worse than I thought...

36:45.495 --> 36:46.305
...it was going to be.

36:46.405 --> 36:48.322
They ought to make it
one of the 10 plagues.

36:48.422 --> 36:50.324
First locusts,
then house hunters.

36:50.424 --> 36:52.693
So, the Dog Ladies are interested.

36:52.793 --> 36:54.387
I'm going for air.
You need anything?

36:54.487 --> 36:55.714
Yeah-- No. We're out of milk.

36:55.814 --> 36:56.349
Milk.
What?

36:56.449 --> 36:57.282
What'd you say?

36:57.382 --> 36:58.909
The Dog Ladies are interested.

36:59.009 --> 36:59.251
Okay.

36:59.351 --> 37:01.035
So are the Matching Sweaters.

37:01.135 --> 37:02.305
Both have asked for financials...

37:02.405 --> 37:02.988
...on the building.

37:03.088 --> 37:04.609
But honestly, I don't think we're gonna...

37:04.709 --> 37:05.324
...get a real offer...

37:05.424 --> 37:07.341
...     while that madman's on the streets.

37:07.441 --> 37:09.544
Oh, my God.

37:09.644 --> 37:11.546
Sorry.
It's later than I think.

37:11.646 --> 37:13.681
Okay.
I'll be back in an hour.

37:13.781 --> 37:15.781
We did good.
Right?

37:16.934 --> 37:20.021
Did we?
I don't know.

37:20.121 --> 37:22.690
We're with Debbie Hoffman,
the 26-year-old bartender...

37:22.790 --> 37:24.357
... who spent several harrowing minutes...

37:24.457 --> 37:24.943
...last evening...

37:25.043 --> 37:27.319
...held hostage by suspected terrorist.

37:27.419 --> 37:28.147
Abdul Pamir.

37:28.247 --> 37:30.580
What exactly happened, Debbie?
I was about to...

37:30.680 --> 37:31.783
...take stock of the shop.

37:31.883 --> 37:34.389
Then this guy comes in. I tell
him we don't open up for another...

37:34.489 --> 37:35.454
...hour, but he won't leave.

37:35.554 --> 37:36.690
Did you see a bomb?

37:36.790 --> 37:37.456
I don't know.

37:37.556 --> 37:39.607
Could there have been
a bomb under his jacket?

37:39.707 --> 37:40.826
Yeah. I don't know. Maybe.

37:40.926 --> 37:43.325
Then what happened?
- He goes up to the register...

37:43.425 --> 37:44.763
...and takes out all the money.

37:44.863 --> 37:46.715
Nearly 200 bucks.
And I yell at him...

37:46.815 --> 37:47.533
...to put it back.

37:47.633 --> 37:49.450
But he didn't.
- No. He just mumbles something...

37:49.550 --> 37:50.602
...and runs right out the door.

37:50.702 --> 37:53.167
What was he saying?
Who knows?

37:53.254 --> 37:54.855
I don't speak Muslim.

37:54.955 --> 37:56.967
Thank you, Debbie.
She thinks Muslim...

37:57.067 --> 37:57.776
...is a language.

37:57.876 --> 38:00.428
Well, there you have it.
A harrowing experience--.

38:00.528 --> 38:03.397
She ought to get a job
with the diplomatic service.

38:03.497 --> 38:05.333
Stay tuned.
We'll be right back--...

38:05.433 --> 38:07.006
...   It's Lily.
The Dog Ladies...

38:07.106 --> 38:07.853
...made an offer.

38:07.953 --> 38:09.704
Really?

38:09.804 --> 38:11.606
How much?
850.

38:11.706 --> 38:14.242
850?
Well, so low?

38:14.342 --> 38:16.110
It's an offer.
That's all.

38:16.210 --> 38:18.172
Yeah-- I don't know.
What do you think?

38:18.272 --> 38:19.298
Should we take this?

38:19.398 --> 38:21.585
What's the rush?
We've only been...

38:21.685 --> 38:23.335
...in the market 20 minutes.

38:23.435 --> 38:25.529
Yeah, but I don't know.
If this guy blows himself up,

38:25.629 --> 38:26.872
we might not get a better offer.

38:26.972 --> 38:28.222
Aunt Ruth has a point.

38:28.322 --> 38:30.024
If this guy's a terrorist,

38:30.124 --> 38:31.777
I say we wait until this blows over...

38:31.877 --> 38:33.011
...or he blows himself up.

38:33.111 --> 38:35.154
Then the prices go back
to where they were.

38:35.254 --> 38:36.081
Okay. It's your call.

38:36.181 --> 38:39.071
Oh. Wait.
I'm getting another call.

38:39.133 --> 38:40.801
Uh, hello?

38:40.901 --> 38:42.955
Don't you think we should think about it?

38:43.055 --> 38:43.555
No, I don't.

38:43.655 --> 38:45.039
No?
No.

38:45.139 --> 38:46.290
Why not?
Because...

38:46.390 --> 38:47.092
...it's too low.

38:47.192 --> 38:50.811
That was the Matching Sweaters
offering to go as high as 875.

38:50.911 --> 38:54.915
875?
But you have to decide now.

38:55.015 --> 38:57.485
Because they don't want
to get into a bidding war.

38:57.585 --> 38:59.728
So the offer is only good for 15 minutes.

38:59.828 --> 39:01.106
But what should we do?

39:01.206 --> 39:03.257
I'm gonna call
the Matching Sweaters...

39:03.357 --> 39:05.426
...   and tell them about
the Dog Ladies' offer.

39:05.526 --> 39:07.384
And then I'm gonna call the Dog Ladies...

39:07.484 --> 39:08.380
...and just stall them.

39:08.480 --> 39:10.618
This is getting confusing.
Relax.

39:10.718 --> 39:11.850
This is what I do.

39:11.950 --> 39:13.834
Mr. Hewitt?
Hi.

39:13.934 --> 39:16.070
I'm going to call the doctor.

39:16.170 --> 39:18.473
He's gonna say that things
are exactly as they were...

39:18.573 --> 39:19.891
...when you called an hour ago.

39:19.991 --> 39:23.077
Ruth, you have got to
learn to stop worrying.

39:23.177 --> 39:25.513
But I like to worry.
It keeps me calm.

39:25.613 --> 39:27.014
Okay.

39:27.114 --> 39:28.916
Good news, bad news.

39:29.016 --> 39:31.122
The Dog Ladies texted.
They're thinking of...

39:31.222 --> 39:31.870
...dropping out.

39:31.970 --> 39:34.622
Matching Sweaters said they
need more time to discuss it.

39:34.722 --> 39:37.458
What's the good news?
- A third party has made a bid.

39:37.558 --> 39:38.627
Who?
- The woman with...

39:38.727 --> 39:39.478
...the blue leggings.

39:39.578 --> 39:41.529
- Which one was that?
- The psychiatrist.

39:41.629 --> 39:44.598
- Oh, her.
- How much is she offering?

39:44.698 --> 39:47.301
885.

39:47.401 --> 39:49.170
Okay, should we take it?

39:49.270 --> 39:52.206
You may have a bidding war
on your hands.

39:52.306 --> 39:54.675
And once that starts,
reason goes out the window.

39:54.775 --> 39:57.545
I have had couples practically
offer me their firstborn.

39:57.645 --> 40:00.948
I am gonna call back Dog Ladies
and Matching Sweaters,

40:01.048 --> 40:02.783
tell them about our new bid.

40:02.883 --> 40:04.385
Then I'm gonna call Blue Leggings...

40:04.485 --> 40:07.822
...and tell her we are considering her offer.

40:07.922 --> 40:09.962
Hi.
This is Lily Portman.

40:10.057 --> 40:12.120
It's like we're talking about Indians...

40:12.220 --> 40:13.145
...in the Old West.

40:13.245 --> 40:15.424
Blue Leggings and Lone Eagle.

40:15.524 --> 40:15.981
Stop it.

40:16.081 --> 40:19.400
Twin Sweaters and Running Trout.

40:19.500 --> 40:22.036
Trout don't run.

40:22.136 --> 40:23.504
Okay, I--...

40:23.604 --> 40:25.339
...   Hold on.

40:25.439 --> 40:26.748
Did you get my message?
Yeah, but.

40:26.848 --> 40:27.459
I don't want this--...

40:27.559 --> 40:31.129
... I understand.
Uh, I will, uh, ask them.

40:31.178 --> 40:33.247
You should pay attention.
Okay. Bye.

40:33.347 --> 40:36.150
Okay, we've got-- Hold on.

40:36.250 --> 40:38.419
Um, hello?
- Lily? Hi.

40:38.519 --> 40:39.647
Yes.
We'll go up...

40:39.747 --> 40:40.205
...to 886.

40:40.305 --> 40:42.390
- 886.
- Yes.

40:42.490 --> 40:43.416
I will let them know.
Okay.

40:43.516 --> 40:43.775
Thanks.

40:43.875 --> 40:45.875
Thank you very much.

40:45.926 --> 40:49.029
Okay.
Here's where we stand.

40:49.129 --> 40:52.266
Matching Sweaters has offered 886.

40:52.366 --> 40:54.168
See?
You were right.

40:54.268 --> 40:55.685
They're bid surfing.
They're trying to ride...

40:55.785 --> 40:56.788
...the crest of the big numbers.

40:56.888 --> 40:59.805
But the first call I got
was from the Dog Ladies.

40:59.905 --> 41:00.959
What'd they say?

41:01.059 --> 41:03.863
They wanna know what
number you need in order...

41:03.963 --> 41:05.030
...to stop the bidding.

41:05.130 --> 41:07.130
Well-- No, no, no.

41:07.181 --> 41:09.116
Tell them to make their best offer...

41:09.216 --> 41:11.619
...   and we'll give it
to whichever is highest.

41:11.719 --> 41:13.754
- That's the way it works.
- Sounds good.

41:13.854 --> 41:17.591
Lily Portman and Associates.
Please hold.

41:17.691 --> 41:19.638
I'm gonna keep you posted.
If you go out, take...

41:19.738 --> 41:20.846
...your cell phones with you.

41:20.946 --> 41:23.431
Lily Portman.
How can I help?

41:23.531 --> 41:25.531
Yes.

41:31.622 --> 41:33.636
I'm going to miss all of this.

41:33.736 --> 41:34.426
Look at it.

41:34.526 --> 41:36.595
Then why are we moving?

41:36.695 --> 41:38.695
I don't--.

41:39.631 --> 41:42.049
Okay. Okay, here.
Okay.

41:42.149 --> 41:43.806
Hello?
Yes, this is.

41:43.906 --> 41:44.952
Dr. Kramer.

41:45.052 --> 41:47.134
Dorothy's come around.
She's conscious...

41:47.234 --> 41:48.407
...and she's taking water.

41:48.507 --> 41:50.717
That's-- That's wonderful.

41:50.758 --> 41:52.665
But we haven't seen
any movement in her legs yet.

41:52.765 --> 41:53.712
That doesn't sound good.

41:53.812 --> 41:55.812
Does it?

41:57.449 --> 41:58.740
When can we come and see her?

41:58.840 --> 41:59.518
Maybe tomorrow?

41:59.618 --> 42:01.636
It might be good for her.
Why don't you come by...

42:01.736 --> 42:02.521
...tomorrow morning.

42:02.621 --> 42:04.238
Well, that would be wonderful.

42:04.338 --> 42:06.440
Thank you very much,
Doctor.

42:06.540 --> 42:07.975
Okay.

42:08.075 --> 42:10.344
Well-- Well--...

42:10.444 --> 42:12.250
...She's putting up a fight.
Yeah. What would you expect...

42:12.350 --> 42:13.131
...from our little girl. Right?

42:13.231 --> 42:15.231
Yeah.
Yeah.

42:16.667 --> 42:18.185
She must be frightened though.

42:18.285 --> 42:19.987
Yeah.

42:20.087 --> 42:22.156
She doesn't know where she is.

42:22.256 --> 42:24.758
She doesn't know where she's going.

42:24.858 --> 42:26.627
Like us.

42:26.727 --> 42:28.362
Mm-hmm.

42:28.462 --> 42:30.462
Like us.

42:45.430 --> 42:47.308
May said they're gonna bring Jackson.

42:47.408 --> 42:48.500
He's back from Hawaii.

42:48.600 --> 42:51.185
Look at that.
God help us.

42:51.285 --> 42:53.287
He's a nice boy.

42:53.387 --> 42:55.595
He's not a boy.
He's a 49-year-old man...

42:55.695 --> 42:57.008
...living with his parents.

42:57.108 --> 42:58.726
Off his parents.
All right, all right.

42:58.826 --> 42:59.144
I know.

42:59.244 --> 43:00.774
He's struggling.
Okay?

43:00.874 --> 43:02.247
We're all struggling.

43:02.347 --> 43:04.767
Honey, it might be
a good time to talk to Larry...

43:04.867 --> 43:05.984
...about your paintings.

43:06.084 --> 43:08.362
My clutter,
you mean.

43:08.462 --> 43:08.736
No.

43:08.836 --> 43:11.071
That's not what I'm talking about.

43:11.171 --> 43:13.141
I mean, when we move,
we're going to have to do...

43:13.241 --> 43:13.992
...something about it.

43:14.092 --> 43:15.993
Nobody wants that stuff.

43:16.093 --> 43:17.294
Huh?

43:17.394 --> 43:19.394
What?
Nobody wants--...

43:19.413 --> 43:20.985
...   No, you don't know that.

43:21.085 --> 43:21.333
Yeah.

43:21.433 --> 43:23.517
I'm gonna throw it away,
I think.

43:23.617 --> 43:25.219
They're your life's work.

43:25.319 --> 43:27.555
Oh, my God.

43:27.655 --> 43:30.724
You never change,
do you? I--.

43:30.824 --> 43:33.761
Larry said that he landed at 7:00.

43:33.861 --> 43:36.559
So as long as the traffic's
not too bad, he will be there to...

43:36.659 --> 43:38.149
...meet you before he has dinner.

43:38.249 --> 43:43.003
And this guy, he's--
he's very influential.

43:43.103 --> 43:47.106
His reviews are, uh-- they're all over...

43:47.206 --> 43:48.208
...the place.

43:48.308 --> 43:50.010
Where are you going?
Home.

43:50.110 --> 43:52.780
What?
Get back here.

43:52.880 --> 43:54.522
You're the artist.
Everyone is...

43:54.622 --> 43:55.800
...expecting you there.

43:55.900 --> 43:58.285
No one gives a shit about my work.

43:58.385 --> 44:01.255
I do.
'Cause you have to.

44:01.355 --> 44:02.923
No. I don't.

44:03.023 --> 44:05.025
Believe me.

44:05.125 --> 44:07.695
We're gonna get there,
the place will be empty.

44:07.795 --> 44:09.706
My work is tedious.
It's derivative.

44:09.806 --> 44:10.916
That was one critic.

44:11.016 --> 44:13.434
Oh, my God.
You're such a baby.

44:13.534 --> 44:15.000
Is this what you're gonna be like...

44:15.100 --> 44:16.421
...every time you have a show?

44:16.521 --> 44:18.087
No, because I won't have another show.

44:18.187 --> 44:19.324
No one cares about my work.

44:19.424 --> 44:20.958
Larry cares.
Only because...

44:21.058 --> 44:21.927
...he's my friend.

44:22.027 --> 44:24.033
No. He is showing it
because he thinks he can...

44:24.133 --> 44:25.096
...make money selling it.

44:25.196 --> 44:27.247
So you should stop whining...

44:27.347 --> 44:30.193
...  and thank God that you have a friend...

44:30.293 --> 44:30.936
...like Larry.

44:31.036 --> 44:32.431
Should thank May.
She's the one...

44:32.531 --> 44:33.738
...who bought him the gallery.

44:33.838 --> 44:35.889
Oh, yeah?

44:35.989 --> 44:37.647
Well, maybe you should've married...

44:37.747 --> 44:38.610
...a rich girl yourself.

44:38.710 --> 44:40.561
Maybe I should have.

44:40.661 --> 44:43.589
But what'd I do instead?
I fell in love...

44:43.689 --> 44:46.117
...with some girl from Brooklyn.

44:46.217 --> 44:47.901
Ah, geez.
You were right.

44:48.001 --> 44:50.486
Empty.

44:56.794 --> 44:58.579
Alex Carver, everybody.

44:58.679 --> 45:02.265
Hi, Larry.
- Hi.

45:03.967 --> 45:05.953
So anyway, tell me.
How's work going?

45:06.053 --> 45:07.390
He's ghostwriting a book for someone.

45:07.490 --> 45:07.706
Really?

45:07.806 --> 45:09.857
Yeah,
it's a self-help book.

45:09.957 --> 45:12.560
How do you ghostwrite a self-help book?

45:12.660 --> 45:13.812
That's what I said.

45:13.912 --> 45:16.997
It pays. And that's--
that's all I care about.

45:17.097 --> 45:19.366
How did Dorothy's surgery go?
- Okay.

45:19.466 --> 45:21.869
She's still not moving her legs.

45:21.969 --> 45:24.304
Don't say that.
Oh, for crying out loud.

45:24.404 --> 45:27.374
Mother. You weren't this upset
when Daddy was in the hospital.

45:27.474 --> 45:29.456
Because she likes the dog
more than she likes me.

45:29.556 --> 45:30.595
Some days, that's for sure.

45:30.695 --> 45:32.438
Oh, here we go.
Table's ready.

45:32.538 --> 45:33.298
Come. Come.

45:33.398 --> 45:34.989
You should leave something.

45:35.089 --> 45:36.301
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

45:36.401 --> 45:38.098
We had the open house this morning.

45:38.198 --> 45:38.803
People came?

45:38.903 --> 45:40.460
They came.
They came in droves.

45:40.560 --> 45:41.172
Small droves.

45:41.272 --> 45:43.123
Okay.
Small droves.

45:43.223 --> 45:45.292
Should we       tell them now?
- Sure.

45:45.392 --> 45:47.687
Might as well.
Tell us what?

45:50.081 --> 45:51.490
Uh-oh.
I'm making Jackson...

45:51.590 --> 45:53.184
...my new partner in the gallery.

45:53.284 --> 45:55.169
Really?

45:55.269 --> 45:57.204
Fishman and Son.
Partners.

45:57.304 --> 45:59.304
That is terrific.
50-50.

45:59.339 --> 46:00.362
Thank you.
Isn't that...

46:00.462 --> 46:01.026
...wonderful?

46:01.126 --> 46:02.126
Yeah, it is.

46:02.226 --> 46:05.412
Jackson will bring a more
youthful take on things.

46:05.512 --> 46:08.461
Anyway,
we were talking today...

46:08.561 --> 46:10.184
...about your show.

46:10.284 --> 46:12.468
Well, you-- you tell him.

46:14.271 --> 46:16.690
We love your stuff,
Alex.

46:16.790 --> 46:18.790
Everyone does.

46:18.826 --> 46:21.729
You've been successful now,
what, 30, 35 years?

46:21.829 --> 46:24.031
Hmm.

46:24.131 --> 46:25.733
But--.

46:25.833 --> 46:29.148
But right now your work is a hard sell.

46:30.154 --> 46:33.100
I mean, uh, the market
is skewing younger...

46:33.200 --> 46:33.958
...these days.

46:34.058 --> 46:36.276
Portraits...

46:36.376 --> 46:38.278
...are not high on people's shopping lists.

46:38.378 --> 46:41.081
They'll come back.
Sure.

46:41.181 --> 46:44.347
But right now,
they are not moving...

46:44.447 --> 46:45.953
...like they used to.

46:46.053 --> 46:50.133
And the bottom line is
you wanna sell your stuff.

46:50.157 --> 46:51.411
Don't you?
- I'm sorry, Jackson.

46:51.511 --> 46:51.976
I don't know.

46:52.076 --> 46:54.794
Are we talking about selling art...

46:54.894 --> 46:56.513
...or selling stuff?

46:56.613 --> 46:58.866
Hey, don't shoot the messenger.

46:58.966 --> 47:01.934
No, because artists really don't paint...

47:02.034 --> 47:03.722
...to satisfy the market.

47:03.822 --> 47:06.070
See what I mean?
Artists actually paint...

47:06.170 --> 47:07.425
...to satisfy themselves.

47:07.525 --> 47:09.543
If you're going to run a gallery,

47:09.643 --> 47:11.145
you know, it's something
you need to know.

47:11.245 --> 47:13.413
Relax, Ruth.
No, I will.

47:13.513 --> 47:15.549
Jackson's running a business.
- Exactly. Exactly.

47:15.649 --> 47:19.119
See, a gallery is a business.

47:19.219 --> 47:21.088
I get what you're saying.

47:21.188 --> 47:23.457
You're saying that Alex should paint...

47:23.557 --> 47:27.461
... what people want him to paint.

47:27.561 --> 47:29.263
That's right.
That's right.

47:29.363 --> 47:31.724
And then maybe
when you have a prospective...

47:31.824 --> 47:32.550
...client lined up,

47:32.650 --> 47:34.938
you and Alex can go and you can visit...

47:35.038 --> 47:36.354
...the client's apartment,

47:36.454 --> 47:38.289
and you can see the
room where they want...

47:38.389 --> 47:39.257
...to hang the painting.

47:39.357 --> 47:42.775
And you can get some color samples...

47:42.875 --> 47:44.344
...of the wall paint.

47:44.444 --> 47:46.747
Fun.
- No, that's not what I meant.

47:46.847 --> 47:50.484
Jackson. Jackson.
Ruth is pulling your leg.

47:50.584 --> 47:53.134
- No, she's not.
- No. I'm not.

47:55.339 --> 47:57.339
I'm not.

48:01.178 --> 48:03.030
You were hard on Jackson.

48:03.130 --> 48:05.252
Well, he better get used to it if he's...

48:05.352 --> 48:06.818
...gonna work with artists.

48:06.918 --> 48:09.770
He's just like Lily.
They just wants us to go away.

48:09.870 --> 48:11.567
Okay. Well, if they do,
then it's up to us...

48:11.667 --> 48:12.457
...to let them know...

48:12.557 --> 48:14.474
...     that we're not gonna go anywhere.

48:14.574 --> 48:16.822
I don't wanna move to Florida
and play shuffleboard.

48:16.922 --> 48:17.428
Oh, my God.

48:17.528 --> 48:20.113
Or live on some bullshit golf range...

48:20.213 --> 48:22.482
...a million miles from everything we know.

48:22.582 --> 48:25.018
Nobody's gonna go live in Florida.

48:25.118 --> 48:27.610
Then where are we gonna go?
We don't wanna wake up and find...

48:27.710 --> 48:28.740
...ourselves out on the street.

48:28.840 --> 48:30.516
Oh, for God's sakes.
Nobody's gonna wake up...

48:30.616 --> 48:31.109
...on the streets.

48:31.209 --> 48:33.349
Alex, why do you always
have to be so melodramatic...

48:33.449 --> 48:33.912
...all the time?

48:34.012 --> 48:35.953
I just don't like our
lives being in the hands...

48:36.053 --> 48:36.848
...of somebody else.

48:36.948 --> 48:38.415
Well, then fine.
Let's do something...

48:38.515 --> 48:39.250
...about it, all right?

48:39.350 --> 48:40.928
Let's take things into our own hands.

48:41.028 --> 48:41.853
How do we do that?

48:41.953 --> 48:43.476
Look at us.
We've always done what we...

48:43.576 --> 48:44.455
...wanted to, haven't we?

48:44.555 --> 48:46.240
Yeah.
Right?

48:46.340 --> 48:48.310
We got married when it was still illegal...

48:48.410 --> 48:48.993
...in 30 states.

48:49.093 --> 48:53.680
And people kept staring at us
in the other 20. Right?

48:53.780 --> 48:56.055
So tell me,
what's finding an apartment...

48:56.155 --> 48:57.468
...in comparison to that?

48:57.568 --> 49:00.167
So let's just go get
ourselves a newspaper...

49:00.267 --> 49:01.306
...and start looking.

49:01.406 --> 49:05.893
What are you laughing at?
Why are you laughing at me?

49:05.993 --> 49:07.249
You're reminding me of that girl...

49:07.349 --> 49:08.046
...with the glasses...

49:08.146 --> 49:09.830
...       that I painted so long ago.

49:09.930 --> 49:11.531
Yeah?
Yes.

49:11.631 --> 49:13.667
Well, here she is,
and I'll tell you one thing.

49:13.767 --> 49:16.108
You're not gonna get my clothes
off so easily this time, mister.

49:16.208 --> 49:16.621
Wanna bet?

49:16.721 --> 49:18.505
Oh, I've got it.
Okay. All right.

49:18.605 --> 49:20.207
Take this.
I got it. I got it.

49:20.307 --> 49:22.276
Oh, wait a minute now.
Yeah.

49:22.376 --> 49:24.077
What do you think?
Where is--.

49:24.177 --> 49:25.712
No, no. Look at this.
No? Where?

49:25.812 --> 49:27.447
Here, here, here.

49:27.547 --> 49:29.783
It says, uh--.

49:29.883 --> 49:31.772
This one's on Franklin Street?

49:31.872 --> 49:32.470
Mm-hmm.

49:32.570 --> 49:34.048
'Cute'?
What's that mean?

49:34.148 --> 49:35.406
That means it's small.

49:35.506 --> 49:37.506
Oh.
So, wait a minute.

49:37.524 --> 49:38.884
What about over here?
Oh, no. Here's one.

49:38.984 --> 49:39.711
Here's one. Here's one.

49:39.811 --> 49:41.299
Look at this one in Brooklyn.

49:41.399 --> 49:42.180
It's in Brooklyn.

49:42.280 --> 49:44.906
Uh, 'two bedrooms,
lots of space and light.

49:45.006 --> 49:46.084
Old-world charm.'

49:46.184 --> 49:47.868
That sounds great,
doesn't it?

49:47.968 --> 49:50.604
That's our listing, Alex.

49:50.704 --> 49:52.572
Oh.

49:52.672 --> 49:53.887
Well, in that case,
we should be able...

49:53.987 --> 49:54.692
...to get it cheap, right?

49:54.792 --> 49:56.376
You think?
Yeah. Why not?

49:56.476 --> 49:58.476
Don't get smart.

49:59.429 --> 50:03.532
��...

50:07.871 --> 50:10.873
...��...

50:16.781 --> 50:20.133
...��.

50:20.233 --> 50:23.070
What did Dad say?
Oh, you know your father.

50:23.170 --> 50:25.405
- He's unsettled.
- He's unsettled?

50:25.505 --> 50:28.075
Honey, he thinks you're too young.

50:28.175 --> 50:31.915
I'm older than you were
when you got married.

50:32.662 --> 50:34.440
What about you?
What do you think...

50:34.540 --> 50:35.800
...about me marrying Alex?

50:35.900 --> 50:39.218
I don't have an opinion.
Of course you do.

50:39.318 --> 50:40.137
What is it?

50:40.237 --> 50:42.356
I'm satisfied.

50:42.456 --> 50:45.425
You're satisfied that I'm getting married?

50:45.525 --> 50:47.627
What do you want?

50:47.727 --> 50:50.458
I want you to be satisfied with that...

50:50.558 --> 50:52.617
...sundae that you're eating.

50:52.717 --> 50:54.451
I want you to be satisfied with the soda...

50:54.551 --> 50:55.420
...that you're drinking.

50:55.520 --> 50:59.788
But you're my mother,
so I want you to be overjoyed...

50:59.888 --> 51:01.692
...that I'm marrying Alex.

51:01.792 --> 51:04.111
At least, I want you
to be happy for me.

51:04.211 --> 51:07.314
- I'm trying.
- Try harder.

51:07.414 --> 51:10.087
Mom is only trying to
say that this marriage...

51:10.187 --> 51:11.436
...is gonna be difficult.

51:11.536 --> 51:13.453
And what marriage isn't?

51:13.553 --> 51:16.323
There's still so much prejudice, and--.

51:16.423 --> 51:18.423
Oh, really, Sarah?

51:18.492 --> 51:21.010
Thank you for telling me.

51:23.180 --> 51:25.180
Think of your children.

51:26.516 --> 51:28.651
Think of your children.

51:30.120 --> 51:32.840
Excuse me.
Excuse me, sweetheart.

51:35.559 --> 51:36.943
You can tell Dad that he doesn't want...

51:37.043 --> 51:37.829
...to make me choose...

51:37.929 --> 51:39.846
... between my family and Alex,

51:39.946 --> 51:43.222
because if he does,
you can tell him that...

51:43.322 --> 51:45.787
...my choice is already made.

51:48.605 --> 51:51.173
��...

51:57.881 --> 52:00.689
... � And foolish
though it may seem �...

52:00.789 --> 52:02.653
...� Though it may seem �...

52:02.753 --> 52:06.239
...         � To me �
� To me ��...

52:06.339 --> 52:08.108
...     This one sounds really nice. Listen.

52:08.208 --> 52:10.577
'Dazzling sun-filled
corner two bedroom,

52:10.677 --> 52:12.690
built-in bookcases,
window seat soaks up...

52:12.790 --> 52:13.898
...the morning sunshine.'

52:13.998 --> 52:17.851
That's nice.
Yeah? Where is it?

52:17.951 --> 52:21.354
It's on 73rd and First.

52:21.454 --> 52:23.390
Do we want to live in Manhattan?

52:23.490 --> 52:25.392
Well, I think it would
be a good change for us.

52:25.492 --> 52:27.461
And we'd be close
to Larry and May's place too.

52:27.561 --> 52:29.796
And how much is it?
Well, it's a lot.

52:29.896 --> 52:32.265
It's $1,100,000.

52:32.365 --> 52:33.967
Okay.
We can't afford that.

52:34.067 --> 52:35.786
Yes, but there's no harm in looking, honey.

52:35.886 --> 52:36.654
No harm in looking.

52:36.754 --> 52:39.655
Oh.

52:41.325 --> 52:43.610
She recognizes us,
honey.

52:43.710 --> 52:45.979
Look at this.
Hello.

52:46.079 --> 52:48.769
She hasn't walked yet,
but she's obviously happy...

52:48.869 --> 52:49.434
...to see you.

52:49.534 --> 52:52.285
Hey.
Of course she is.

52:52.385 --> 52:54.254
Look at her.
She's bandaged up.

52:54.354 --> 52:55.714
Can I touch her,
Doctor?

52:55.814 --> 52:56.374
Of course.

52:56.474 --> 53:01.261
Hey. Oh, yes.
You're so good.

53:01.361 --> 53:03.897
You hang in there, kiddo.
You hang in there.

53:03.997 --> 53:05.398
You hear me?
You're such a good girl.

53:05.498 --> 53:06.800
Hang in there.
Good girl.

53:06.900 --> 53:08.301
That-a-girl.

53:08.401 --> 53:10.061
I know she's gonna walk.
I know it.

53:10.161 --> 53:10.955
Of course she is.

53:11.055 --> 53:13.376
She's a fighter,
like you.

53:13.476 --> 53:14.174
Like us.

53:14.274 --> 53:17.110
So, what's a junior bedroom?
Does it have bunk beds?

53:17.210 --> 53:18.655
Well, if it does,
you get the top one.

53:18.755 --> 53:19.864
Okay, honey? No, this is it.

53:19.964 --> 53:21.648
This is it.
You're kidding.

53:21.748 --> 53:24.117
Yeah. No, this is it.
It sure sounded better...

53:24.217 --> 53:25.470
...in the paper, didn't it?

53:25.570 --> 53:27.621
We're wasting our time.

53:27.721 --> 53:29.615
No, come on. We're here.
Well, let's just look, okay?

53:29.715 --> 53:30.541
Wait a second. Which--.

53:30.641 --> 53:32.259
Oh.

53:32.359 --> 53:33.401
It buzzed.
I got in.

53:33.501 --> 53:34.212
Okay, got it.

53:34.312 --> 53:36.963
4C.
Oh, 4C?

53:37.063 --> 53:39.032
Are you sure?
That's what the sign said.

53:39.132 --> 53:41.132
Okay.

53:46.056 --> 53:47.690
That's the-- Okay.

53:47.790 --> 53:48.608
Come on.

53:48.708 --> 53:50.810
All right.
I'm coming. I'm coming.

53:50.910 --> 53:53.095
Let's see.

54:10.013 --> 54:12.013
Oh, wow.

54:13.116 --> 54:15.317
Don't even bother.

54:17.254 --> 54:20.556
Um-- Let me check this--.

54:33.203 --> 54:35.203
It's you again.

54:36.606 --> 54:38.892
Hmm. I'm afraid so.

54:38.992 --> 54:41.695
It's not as nice as your place.

54:41.795 --> 54:43.795
It's not, is it?

54:46.716 --> 54:48.435
Where's your mom?

54:48.535 --> 54:52.020
Where do you think?
Lying down on the bed.

54:52.657 --> 54:54.841
How's your dog doing?

54:54.941 --> 54:58.371
She survived the operation,
but still hasn't moved...

54:58.471 --> 54:59.397
...her hind legs.

54:59.497 --> 55:02.048
She will.
You think so?

55:02.148 --> 55:04.784
Yeah. I know things like that.

55:04.884 --> 55:06.884
I see.

55:08.138 --> 55:09.756
I'm gonna go get my mom.

55:09.856 --> 55:11.725
This time in a taxi.

55:11.825 --> 55:13.727
We're going now to Logan Crawford,

55:13.827 --> 55:15.836
who is reporting from
underneath the FDR...

55:15.936 --> 55:17.081
...with the abandoned taxi.

55:17.181 --> 55:18.932
What's going on?

55:19.032 --> 55:21.201
Pamir.
He hijacked a taxi.

55:21.301 --> 55:22.702
When?
This morning.

55:22.802 --> 55:24.471
Really?

55:24.571 --> 55:26.306
Reporting underneath the FDR Drive.

55:26.406 --> 55:27.772
The driver reported that
Mr. Pamir seemed...

55:27.872 --> 55:28.326
...very nervous...

55:28.426 --> 55:30.443
...and he kept on asking,
'What are the police doing?'.

55:30.543 --> 55:33.262
He also asked about his family
and seemed to be...

55:33.362 --> 55:34.232
...saying a prayer.

55:34.332 --> 55:36.608
I think we should take
the 885 that Blue Leggings...

55:36.708 --> 55:37.168
...is offering.

55:37.268 --> 55:40.583
No, we don't want
to rush into anything.

55:42.006 --> 55:44.083
It's them.
Did you see, honey?

55:44.183 --> 55:44.442
Yes.

55:44.542 --> 55:46.142
They're not interested
in our place anymore.

55:46.242 --> 55:47.178
Now, you don't know that.

55:47.278 --> 55:48.828
Yeah, well, they're here,
aren't they?

55:48.928 --> 55:50.215
They're just hedging their bets.

55:50.315 --> 55:50.881
Wouldn't you?

55:50.981 --> 55:53.485
Oh, please.
It's just making me...

55:53.585 --> 55:55.585
...so nervous.

56:04.327 --> 56:06.446
So, you wanna see this place?

56:06.546 --> 56:08.615
Not if it's as bad as the last one.

56:08.715 --> 56:10.483
Well, don't be discouraged.
We're just looking.

56:10.583 --> 56:12.952
Yes. I didn't know how bad it could be.

56:13.052 --> 56:15.255
It's in the neighborhood.
Remember? You remember it.

56:15.355 --> 56:16.882
It's the sunny two bedroom.

56:16.982 --> 56:17.408
Oh. Yes.

56:17.508 --> 56:20.564
It's probably in a basement.
It's in the basement.

56:20.664 --> 56:20.978
Yeah.

56:21.078 --> 56:22.962
Okay.
I think this is it.

56:23.062 --> 56:24.698
Oh.

56:24.798 --> 56:27.834
This looks nice,
and it's on the ninth floor.

56:27.934 --> 56:31.271
We've never lived that high up before.

56:31.371 --> 56:33.173
What's this?
Oh, I know what it is.

56:33.273 --> 56:35.675
It said Vincent, right?
Here we go.

56:35.775 --> 56:36.812
Yeah.
I think that's it.

56:36.912 --> 56:37.561
There we go.

56:37.661 --> 56:39.661
Oh. Sorry.

56:41.998 --> 56:45.129
Here's a flyer for you,
if you want to take that...

56:45.229 --> 56:46.269
...with you. Sure.

56:46.369 --> 56:49.789
Excuse me. Oh.
Oh, this is so much nicer.

56:49.889 --> 56:52.158
Really.
Didn't I tell you?

56:52.258 --> 56:54.682
Look at this entranceway.
I love this kind of...

56:54.782 --> 56:56.113
...an entranceway, honey.

56:56.213 --> 56:58.498
And what about the light?
Yeah. Very good.

56:58.598 --> 57:00.834
It's not even that bright out today.

57:00.934 --> 57:02.666
Honey, I'm gonna go find some water...

57:02.766 --> 57:03.421
...and take a pill.

57:03.521 --> 57:05.372
All right. All right.
All right. All right.

57:05.472 --> 57:07.472
Aah.

57:08.591 --> 57:11.126
Piece of shit.

57:17.300 --> 57:19.300
Here.

57:19.602 --> 57:21.888
Oh. Hey, you.

57:21.988 --> 57:25.058
Why do they make it
so hard to open?

57:25.158 --> 57:27.327
Childproof.

57:27.427 --> 57:28.928
Of course.

57:29.028 --> 57:30.897
Do you like this place?

57:30.997 --> 57:33.521
It's the best we've seen so far.

57:33.621 --> 57:35.352
Put that back for me.

57:35.452 --> 57:38.004
But it's still not as nice as yours.

57:38.104 --> 57:40.104
Nothing is.

57:42.992 --> 57:45.245
I hope you find a place you like.

57:45.345 --> 57:47.080
So do I.

57:47.180 --> 57:51.012
And when we do,
I'm going to invite you...

57:51.112 --> 57:51.618
...to tea.

57:51.718 --> 57:53.718
- How is that?
- Cool.

57:56.906 --> 57:58.792
Oh. Sorry.

57:58.892 --> 58:00.651
Okay, I like this place.
I really do.

58:00.751 --> 58:01.712
I really like it a lot.

58:01.812 --> 58:03.791
Come here. I want to show you something.

58:03.891 --> 58:04.749
Just see this room.

58:04.849 --> 58:07.267
Look at this, honey.

58:07.367 --> 58:09.803
Look. Oh.

58:09.903 --> 58:11.903
Yes.

58:11.905 --> 58:13.266
I'm going to talk to the agent.

58:13.366 --> 58:13.591
Okay.

58:13.691 --> 58:15.279
Okay.
I'm doing it.

58:15.379 --> 58:15.809
Yeah.

58:15.909 --> 58:17.909
I'm doing it.

58:29.005 --> 58:31.958
Nowhere is going to have
a view like our place.

58:32.058 --> 58:36.262
But maybe Ruth and I have seen
all the views we need to.

58:36.362 --> 58:38.231
Maybe views are for younger people...

58:38.331 --> 58:41.391
...who still have things to look at.

58:43.219 --> 58:44.915
Okay. We'll look to hear from you guys...

58:45.015 --> 58:45.623
...this afternoon.

58:45.723 --> 58:47.157
Thank you.
Oh, here she is.

58:47.257 --> 58:47.858
Here she is.

58:47.958 --> 58:50.243
Oh, hi. Excuse me.

58:50.343 --> 58:52.512
Actually, my husband and I
are very interested.

58:52.612 --> 58:54.487
Well, I don't have to tell you, this listing...

58:54.587 --> 58:55.633
...is getting a lot of heat.

58:55.733 --> 58:57.650
Oh, yes.
We can see that.

58:57.750 --> 59:00.186
Let me be frank with you.
Can you afford...

59:00.286 --> 59:01.272
...a place like this?

59:01.372 --> 59:03.022
What do you mean?
I only ask because...

59:03.122 --> 59:05.658
...   no one's gonna give you
a 30-year mortgage.

59:05.758 --> 59:09.496
We don't need a mortgage.
- Oh. Well. Then make an offer.

59:09.596 --> 59:12.031
The owners are willing
to consider anything.

59:12.131 --> 59:14.033
But they're only accepting bids until 3:00.

59:14.133 --> 59:16.503
That's two hours.
Mm-hmm.

59:16.603 --> 59:18.271
Have your offer here by then.

59:18.371 --> 59:19.702
They'll make their decision...

59:19.802 --> 59:20.324
...right away.

59:20.424 --> 59:23.676
Okay. All right. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

59:23.776 --> 59:25.178
Oh, God.
Ma'am?

59:25.278 --> 59:27.113
Yes?

59:27.213 --> 59:29.791
A lot of people include
a personal message...

59:29.891 --> 59:30.768
...with their offer.

59:30.868 --> 59:32.952
What kind of personal message?

59:33.052 --> 59:34.552
Something that persuades the seller...

59:34.652 --> 59:35.339
...to give it to you...

59:35.439 --> 59:37.724
...in case there's a tie.

59:37.824 --> 59:40.360
Just don't be afraid
to pull on the heartstrings.

59:40.460 --> 59:42.460
Oh.
Right.

59:50.019 --> 59:51.830
How do you like that one talking to us...

59:51.930 --> 59:53.324
...like we don't know anything?

59:53.424 --> 59:55.141
I bet we've got more real money...

59:55.241 --> 59:57.710
... than all those young hotshots anyway.

59:57.810 --> 01:00:01.975
But I just want to know.
What did you think of it?

01:00:03.032 --> 01:00:05.032
I liked it.
Really?

01:00:05.118 --> 01:00:07.987
Yeah.
Let's bid on it.

01:00:08.087 --> 01:00:10.109
How-- We haven't sold our own place yet.

01:00:10.209 --> 01:00:11.041
Yeah, but we will.

01:00:11.141 --> 01:00:12.992
We will.
We had a bunch of offers.

01:00:13.092 --> 01:00:14.572
And you heard the real estate broker...

01:00:14.672 --> 01:00:14.845
...say...

01:00:14.945 --> 01:00:17.931
...that they're very willing to
consider anything until 3:00.

01:00:18.031 --> 01:00:19.612
Come on.
Don't look at me like that.

01:00:19.712 --> 01:00:20.117
Any offer.

01:00:20.217 --> 01:00:22.235
That's like until 3:00.

01:00:22.335 --> 01:00:25.204
It's a beautiful apartment.
Yeah, it's all right.

01:00:25.304 --> 01:00:27.740
It has a lot of light.
Yes. It has light.

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:30.209
It has an elevator and more room.

01:00:30.309 --> 01:00:32.779
New paint.

01:00:32.879 --> 01:00:36.683
Honey? Come on.
Let's do it. Come on.

01:00:36.783 --> 01:00:40.268
It sounds like something you really want.

01:00:43.006 --> 01:00:45.291
In that case,
we'll see another doctor.

01:00:45.391 --> 01:00:47.391
What for?

01:00:47.393 --> 01:00:49.311
He'll say the same thing the others did.

01:00:49.411 --> 01:00:49.914
Maybe not.

01:00:50.014 --> 01:00:52.814
Alex, you know he will.

01:00:54.652 --> 01:00:56.773
It's the most natural thing in the world,

01:00:56.873 --> 01:00:58.022
and I can't even do it.

01:00:58.122 --> 01:01:00.206
My mother.
My sisters.

01:01:00.306 --> 01:01:03.026
They turn 'em out like machines.

01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:05.120
one after another.

01:01:05.461 --> 01:01:08.214
We don't need children.

01:01:08.314 --> 01:01:11.884
No one needs children,
Alex.

01:01:11.984 --> 01:01:14.120
People want them.

01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:16.905
I want them.
You want them.

01:01:18.041 --> 01:01:20.159
Shit.

01:01:20.259 --> 01:01:21.894
Shit.

01:01:21.994 --> 01:01:24.063
God.

01:01:24.163 --> 01:01:27.133
I am a goddamned failure.

01:01:27.233 --> 01:01:30.252
You are not a failure.

01:01:31.721 --> 01:01:33.973
I've disappointed you.

01:01:34.073 --> 01:01:36.943
You've never disappointed me, Ruth.

01:01:37.043 --> 01:01:38.697
I can see it in your face.

01:01:38.797 --> 01:01:39.964
Stop saying that.

01:01:40.064 --> 01:01:41.603
You have classrooms full of children.

01:01:41.703 --> 01:01:42.533
Those are your kids.

01:01:42.633 --> 01:01:45.418
That's not the same thing.

01:01:45.518 --> 01:01:48.064
Then me. I'm your kid.
You're always telling me...

01:01:48.164 --> 01:01:49.306
...what a big baby I am.

01:01:49.406 --> 01:01:51.940
Well, you are.

01:02:04.754 --> 01:02:06.345
You really like it,
don't you?

01:02:06.445 --> 01:02:06.657
I do.

01:02:06.757 --> 01:02:08.808
And, honey, admit it,
you do too.

01:02:08.908 --> 01:02:10.843
I mean, I know-- Wait a second.

01:02:10.943 --> 01:02:12.692
I know it's not our place,
but we're never gonna find...

01:02:12.792 --> 01:02:13.731
...another place like our place.

01:02:13.831 --> 01:02:16.182
And we won't find
anything better than this.

01:02:16.282 --> 01:02:17.745
So, Alex,
I mean, it's just--.

01:02:17.845 --> 01:02:19.003
What is it? It's a bid.

01:02:19.103 --> 01:02:21.554
It's not a commitment.

01:02:21.654 --> 01:02:24.123
It's, like-- You know,
we're not going to find--...

01:02:24.223 --> 01:02:26.145
...  They're never going to take it.

01:02:26.245 --> 01:02:26.744
Trust me.

01:02:26.844 --> 01:02:28.702
All right, fine.
Let's do it.

01:02:28.802 --> 01:02:29.346
Really?

01:02:29.446 --> 01:02:31.050
Yeah.
Should we call Lily?

01:02:31.150 --> 01:02:31.315
No.

01:02:31.415 --> 01:02:34.000
You said you thought
we should do this ourselves,

01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:35.902
so I think we should,
but we have to be smart.

01:02:36.002 --> 01:02:38.204
What do you think we should offer?

01:02:38.304 --> 01:02:41.248
Well, not so low that we have no chance.

01:02:41.348 --> 01:02:41.825
I know.

01:02:41.925 --> 01:02:44.864
But not so high
that we start with something...

01:02:44.964 --> 01:02:45.963
...we can't afford.

01:02:46.063 --> 01:02:47.926
So what would be the point of that?

01:02:48.026 --> 01:02:48.332
Right?

01:02:48.432 --> 01:02:50.595
I don't know.
This is what I think.

01:02:50.695 --> 01:02:51.669
I think 900,000.

01:02:51.769 --> 01:02:53.553
That's too low.
910.

01:02:53.653 --> 01:02:55.354
You think?
I don't know.

01:02:55.454 --> 01:02:58.057
Well, uh-- You think?

01:02:58.157 --> 01:03:00.560
910?
920. No, 920.

01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:02.495
No, but that's too much.
That's way too much.

01:03:02.595 --> 01:03:04.330
Honey, do you want the place or not?

01:03:04.430 --> 01:03:05.567
Yes. I definitely want the place.

01:03:05.667 --> 01:03:06.650
I want to be in the running.

01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:08.367
So 920.
920.

01:03:08.467 --> 01:03:10.703
No. 925.
It's more impressive.

01:03:10.803 --> 01:03:12.354
Whoa.
Listen to you.

01:03:12.454 --> 01:03:12.872
What?

01:03:12.972 --> 01:03:15.575
You sound like you're
some sort of an auctioneer.

01:03:15.675 --> 01:03:17.877
Okay. Do I hear 930?

01:03:17.977 --> 01:03:19.779
Yeah. Yeah, 930.
930?

01:03:19.879 --> 01:03:21.514
That's a lot better.

01:03:21.614 --> 01:03:25.184
I mean, so, what the heck?
It's just money.

01:03:25.237 --> 01:03:27.237
Yeah.

01:03:27.336 --> 01:03:30.389
This is hard to write
when I don't know exactly...

01:03:30.489 --> 01:03:32.242
...what these people are like.

01:03:32.342 --> 01:03:34.927
Tell 'em I'm senile
and I want to live by the zoo.

01:03:35.027 --> 01:03:37.530
Be serious.
Please.

01:03:37.630 --> 01:03:40.032
How 'bout donating a park bench
with their name on it?

01:03:40.132 --> 01:03:42.969
Okay.

01:03:43.069 --> 01:03:46.221
Ah, just tell them we love the place.

01:03:47.857 --> 01:03:49.334
Breaking news.
The bartender.

01:03:49.434 --> 01:03:50.227
Debbie Hoffman,

01:03:50.327 --> 01:03:53.079
who claimed that Pamir
robbed her cash register,

01:03:53.179 --> 01:03:56.549
has now been charged with
theft and misleading police...

01:03:56.649 --> 01:03:58.718
...after she admitted
that she took the money. .

01:03:58.818 --> 01:04:02.321
Yeah. I knew there was
something wrong with that.

01:04:02.421 --> 01:04:04.223
Al-- Alex?
Oh, my God.

01:04:04.323 --> 01:04:05.925
Alex?
What?

01:04:06.025 --> 01:04:08.895
- We got the apartment.
- What? Already?

01:04:08.995 --> 01:04:11.063
Yeah.
Isn't that wonderful?

01:04:11.163 --> 01:04:12.983
Now, they want us to come over with...

01:04:13.083 --> 01:04:14.084
...the check right now.

01:04:14.184 --> 01:04:16.904
Right now?
That's what they said.

01:04:20.223 --> 01:04:23.109
I don't know.
You don't know what?

01:04:23.209 --> 01:04:25.214
I mean,
I think we should wait.

01:04:25.314 --> 01:04:25.963
For what?

01:04:26.063 --> 01:04:28.326
We don't wanna be giving
our money to somebody...

01:04:28.426 --> 01:04:29.366
...with all this going on.

01:04:29.466 --> 01:04:30.494
We're gonna lose this apartment.

01:04:30.594 --> 01:04:31.468
That's what we're gonna do.

01:04:31.568 --> 01:04:33.122
We're not gonna lose it.
What am I going to say...

01:04:33.222 --> 01:04:34.037
...to the real estate broker?

01:04:34.137 --> 01:04:36.189
Just tell 'em we-- we-- we--...

01:04:36.289 --> 01:04:38.075
...     What?
Tell them we can't...

01:04:38.175 --> 01:04:39.209
...get there right now.

01:04:39.309 --> 01:04:41.427
They're gonna take
the next best offer, Alex.

01:04:41.527 --> 01:04:42.995
No, they won't.
Yes, they are.

01:04:43.095 --> 01:04:44.664
No, they won't.

01:04:44.764 --> 01:04:47.099
Oh.
Wait. Don't pick it up.

01:04:47.199 --> 01:04:48.391
Don't-- Don't-- Don't-- I just left...

01:04:48.491 --> 01:04:49.419
...a message on your cell.

01:04:49.519 --> 01:04:51.204
The sellers are getting anxious.

01:04:51.304 --> 01:04:53.005
If we don't hear from you soon,

01:04:53.105 --> 01:04:54.841
they're gonna open up
the bidding again.

01:04:54.941 --> 01:04:56.762
You heard what she said?
They're going to reopen...

01:04:56.862 --> 01:04:57.261
...the bidding.

01:04:57.361 --> 01:04:58.945
She's bluffing.
She's not bluffing.

01:04:59.045 --> 01:05:01.347
Right now we're the only ones
that are bluffing.

01:05:01.447 --> 01:05:02.981
Come on, honey.
We've gone this far.

01:05:03.081 --> 01:05:04.134
We can't back down now.

01:05:04.234 --> 01:05:05.852
The last thing we need,
Ruth,

01:05:05.952 --> 01:05:07.720
is for somebody else to be
pushing us into something.

01:05:07.820 --> 01:05:11.357
Nobody is pushing us into anything.

01:05:11.457 --> 01:05:12.814
Take things into our own hands.

01:05:12.914 --> 01:05:14.111
That's what you said, honey.

01:05:14.211 --> 01:05:17.196
I know what I said.
Will you please look at me?

01:05:17.296 --> 01:05:19.665
All day yesterday,
I heard you complain...

01:05:19.765 --> 01:05:22.702
...about being treated like garbage
and ending up on the streets.

01:05:22.802 --> 01:05:25.371
And then finally last night,
we decide to make a move,

01:05:25.471 --> 01:05:28.207
but only if we have total control.

01:05:28.307 --> 01:05:30.843
So, we look at a few places.

01:05:30.943 --> 01:05:33.578
And then finally-- finally
we get excited about one,

01:05:33.678 --> 01:05:34.598
we make an offer,

01:05:34.698 --> 01:05:36.482
and lo and behold,
we get it.

01:05:36.582 --> 01:05:39.051
We actually get the place.
And now you wanna back down?

01:05:39.151 --> 01:05:41.644
Listen, if you wanna
take control, this is how...

01:05:41.744 --> 01:05:43.040
...we take control, honey.

01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:45.758
All I'm saying, Ruth,
is this is a lot of money.

01:05:45.858 --> 01:05:48.227
I know, but if we walk away from this,

01:05:48.327 --> 01:05:50.563
we'll just be acting
like a couple of old fools.

01:05:50.663 --> 01:05:52.881
Hello?
Anybody home?

01:05:54.250 --> 01:05:55.902
Hey. Oh.

01:05:56.002 --> 01:06:00.573
My God. Everybody is
so crazy out there.

01:06:00.673 --> 01:06:02.373
I wish they would go ahead and find...

01:06:02.473 --> 01:06:03.227
...this guy already.

01:06:03.327 --> 01:06:06.078
Jesus.
All right.

01:06:06.178 --> 01:06:08.414
Here's where we are.

01:06:08.514 --> 01:06:13.429
Blue Leggings is our last solid bid...

01:06:13.529 --> 01:06:14.387
...at 885.

01:06:14.487 --> 01:06:17.723
But the Dog Ladies have called...

01:06:17.823 --> 01:06:21.665
...and they wanna come by
in a few minutes...

01:06:21.765 --> 01:06:23.262
...with a counterbid.

01:06:23.362 --> 01:06:26.065
Apparently, they wanna do it in person...

01:06:26.165 --> 01:06:28.100
... because they wanna
make some kind of--...

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:30.036
... What's the matter?

01:06:30.136 --> 01:06:31.801
Aunt Ruth,
what happened?

01:06:31.901 --> 01:06:32.389
Oh. We--.

01:06:32.489 --> 01:06:34.720
We saw a place this morning.
What do you mean...

01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:35.592
...you saw a place?

01:06:35.692 --> 01:06:37.806
We went to an open house this morning.

01:06:37.906 --> 01:06:38.695
and we loved it.

01:06:38.795 --> 01:06:41.047
You went to an open house today?

01:06:41.147 --> 01:06:42.687
If you knew you were ready to look--.

01:06:42.787 --> 01:06:43.567
I don't understand.

01:06:43.667 --> 01:06:45.918
Why didn't you call me first?
- Oh, what? Wait.

01:06:46.018 --> 01:06:47.920
We don't need to be asking you
for permission.

01:06:48.020 --> 01:06:51.724
No, I-I realize that,
but I have listings too.

01:06:51.824 --> 01:06:54.143
I have stacks of listings,
and I have done...

01:06:54.243 --> 01:06:55.412
...a lot of work for you.

01:06:55.512 --> 01:06:57.988
This isn't the easiest market.
Why didn't you call me first.

01:06:58.088 --> 01:06:58.548
Aunt Ruth?

01:06:58.648 --> 01:07:00.399
I'm sorry, Lily.
I really am sorry.

01:07:00.499 --> 01:07:02.168
It wasn't her idea.
It was mine.

01:07:02.268 --> 01:07:05.938
An apartment might not be
the best idea for you right now.

01:07:06.038 --> 01:07:08.240
There are other--
- Bullshit. Wait a minute now.

01:07:08.340 --> 01:07:10.707
We'll decide where we're gonna live.

01:07:10.807 --> 01:07:11.528
Okay. Okay.

01:07:11.628 --> 01:07:13.679
Have it your way.
Where is it?

01:07:13.779 --> 01:07:15.200
This place that you like so much?

01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:15.966
It's in Manhattan.

01:07:16.066 --> 01:07:17.577
Yeah,
it's on 73rd and First.

01:07:17.677 --> 01:07:18.802
It's just so beautiful.

01:07:18.902 --> 01:07:20.953
- And how much is it?
- A million, one.

01:07:21.053 --> 01:07:22.655
- A million, one.
- Mm-hmm.

01:07:22.755 --> 01:07:25.305
I don't know.
We made an offer.

01:07:25.841 --> 01:07:28.027
- I don't believe this.
- Well, they accepted it.

01:07:28.127 --> 01:07:30.162
- What did you offer?
- 930.

01:07:30.262 --> 01:07:31.697
And they took it?

01:07:31.797 --> 01:07:33.797
Yes.
Yes.

01:07:35.818 --> 01:07:38.392
That's not bad.
- Oh? So we're not such fools...

01:07:38.492 --> 01:07:39.256
...after all, huh?

01:07:39.356 --> 01:07:41.107
Okay.

01:07:41.207 --> 01:07:43.943
Okay. Uh, let's get real
here for a minute.

01:07:44.043 --> 01:07:46.315
So, nobody buys an apartment nowadays...

01:07:46.415 --> 01:07:47.831
...before they sell their own,

01:07:47.931 --> 01:07:49.429
especially not with what's going on...

01:07:49.529 --> 01:07:49.900
...out there.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.650
- Who's the agent?
- I have the card.

01:07:51.750 --> 01:07:53.352
Wait.
I know where it is.

01:07:53.452 --> 01:07:54.726
I know I have it.
I know where it is.

01:07:54.826 --> 01:07:54.972
Wait.

01:07:55.072 --> 01:07:56.989
A woman, or-- No, no. Wait. Wait.

01:07:57.089 --> 01:07:59.558
Yeah?
Oh. Okay.

01:07:59.658 --> 01:08:02.328
Miriam. Miriam.
Carswell?

01:08:02.428 --> 01:08:04.230
Yes.
She's a shark.

01:08:04.330 --> 01:08:05.473
What?
She's gonna eat you...

01:08:05.573 --> 01:08:06.116
...for breakfast.

01:08:06.216 --> 01:08:08.067
What did she say?
They want the deposit.

01:08:08.167 --> 01:08:09.883
Well, of course they do. When?

01:08:09.983 --> 01:08:10.520
Right now.

01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:12.338
What did you tell 'em?

01:08:12.438 --> 01:08:14.173
Well, we haven't called her back yet.

01:08:14.273 --> 01:08:16.242
No, but wait a minute.
We want this apartment.

01:08:16.341 --> 01:08:18.553
Well, then it is crucial
that you sell this place...

01:08:18.653 --> 01:08:18.828
...fast.

01:08:18.929 --> 01:08:20.813
Okay.
Okay, okay, okay.

01:08:20.912 --> 01:08:23.401
Give me a minute to think this through.

01:08:23.501 --> 01:08:23.767
Um--.

01:08:23.867 --> 01:08:25.805
I'm gonna-- Yeah, I'm gonna call Miriam.

01:08:25.906 --> 01:08:27.104
Okay. Let me handle her.

01:08:27.203 --> 01:08:30.923
Oh, God, she is upset.

01:08:31.023 --> 01:08:32.627
I don't know why she
couldn't talk to them...

01:08:32.727 --> 01:08:33.210
...in front of us.

01:08:33.310 --> 01:08:35.661
I hope we haven't stepped on her toes.

01:08:35.761 --> 01:08:37.161
I don't want them making deals...

01:08:37.261 --> 01:08:38.048
...behind our backs.

01:08:38.148 --> 01:08:40.666
I didn't know the protocol.
We just saw an apartment...

01:08:40.765 --> 01:08:41.151
...we liked.

01:08:41.251 --> 01:08:42.689
I don't-- It's all right, baby.

01:08:42.788 --> 01:08:43.319
She'll live.

01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:46.005
Okay, here's where we stand.

01:08:46.104 --> 01:08:47.716
I convinced Miriam that you're serious...

01:08:47.816 --> 01:08:48.859
...but that you have to rest.

01:08:48.959 --> 01:08:51.077
I reminded her how old you are.

01:08:51.176 --> 01:08:53.850
I reassured her that we
would all be there by 5:00...

01:08:53.951 --> 01:08:54.831
...with the deposit.

01:08:54.930 --> 01:08:57.116
Okay. Uh, what time is it though?

01:08:57.216 --> 01:08:58.783
What time do we-- It's 3:30.

01:08:58.884 --> 01:09:01.220
And the Dog Ladies
will be here any second, so--...

01:09:01.319 --> 01:09:03.848
... Wait, wait, Lily.
Now, aren't we moving...

01:09:03.948 --> 01:09:05.142
...a little quickly here?

01:09:05.242 --> 01:09:06.930
May I remind you that you're the ones...

01:09:07.029 --> 01:09:08.578
...who want to buy a new apartment.

01:09:08.678 --> 01:09:10.696
This is how it works.
Dog eat dog.

01:09:10.796 --> 01:09:13.732
- You snooze, you lose.
- Okay.

01:09:13.832 --> 01:09:15.634
And one more thing.

01:09:15.734 --> 01:09:16.819
I told Miriam that I'm the one...

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:18.087
...who steered you to her listing.

01:09:18.188 --> 01:09:20.473
So if she asks,
back me up.

01:09:20.573 --> 01:09:22.390
The least you can do is
help me get a piece...

01:09:22.490 --> 01:09:23.493
...of the commission on it.

01:09:23.593 --> 01:09:24.953
Well, sure.
I mean, obviously.

01:09:25.053 --> 01:09:25.996
That's only fair, Lily.

01:09:26.095 --> 01:09:29.265
Okay. So, let me know
as soon as you hear...

01:09:29.366 --> 01:09:30.934
...the Dog Ladies' offer.

01:09:31.033 --> 01:09:33.652
And keep your fingers crossed
that it's at least 950.

01:09:33.752 --> 01:09:35.955
Because that's what we need
to make this work.

01:09:36.055 --> 01:09:39.040
9-5-0.
Otherwise, we're screwed.

01:09:40.376 --> 01:09:42.428
Man.

01:09:42.528 --> 01:09:44.395
She really does talk too much.

01:09:44.496 --> 01:09:46.432
Authorities may be
one step closer...

01:09:46.532 --> 01:09:48.300
...  to catching the terror suspect.

01:09:48.399 --> 01:09:49.019
Abdul Pamir.

01:09:49.118 --> 01:09:51.002
Police have released
security camera footage...

01:09:51.103 --> 01:09:53.506
...that appears to show Pamir
looking over his shoulder--...

01:09:53.606 --> 01:09:55.174
...and showing obvious concern.
Oh, God.

01:09:55.274 --> 01:09:56.842
Doorbell.
I know it is.

01:09:56.942 --> 01:09:59.152
Move it.
Move it, handsome.

01:10:03.232 --> 01:10:04.750
Why, hello.
I hope you don't mind us...

01:10:04.850 --> 01:10:05.902
...just stopping by like this.

01:10:06.002 --> 01:10:07.412
We were training Harold in the park.

01:10:07.512 --> 01:10:08.605
We're here to make on offer.

01:10:08.705 --> 01:10:10.953
Oh, well, please come in.
Would you like something...

01:10:11.053 --> 01:10:11.408
...to drink?

01:10:11.508 --> 01:10:12.793
Anything.
Oh, no. We don't...

01:10:12.893 --> 01:10:13.643
...want to intrude.

01:10:13.743 --> 01:10:15.528
Just give them the bid, Annie.

01:10:15.628 --> 01:10:17.696
So, this is as high as we can go.

01:10:17.796 --> 01:10:19.832
- How is your dog doing?
- Mmm.

01:10:19.932 --> 01:10:22.312
Well, it's actually kind of touch and go, so.

01:10:22.412 --> 01:10:22.786
Oh, no.

01:10:22.886 --> 01:10:24.818
I'm so sorry.
Harold's actually not...

01:10:24.918 --> 01:10:26.089
...doing so well either.

01:10:26.189 --> 01:10:27.806
No?
In school.

01:10:27.906 --> 01:10:29.515
He has a learning disability.

01:10:29.615 --> 01:10:30.127
We think.

01:10:30.227 --> 01:10:32.478
Oh.
Wanna give her the--...

01:10:32.578 --> 01:10:34.180
...       Will they, uh-- So this is our letter.

01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:36.515
In case there's a tie.
Okay. Thank you.

01:10:36.615 --> 01:10:38.984
Oh, Harold. Sorry.

01:10:39.084 --> 01:10:42.283
Harold. Thank you.
You concentrate, now.

01:10:42.383 --> 01:10:44.383
Do you hear me?

01:10:45.041 --> 01:10:47.226
Don't open that letter
till you've read their offer.

01:10:47.326 --> 01:10:49.361
What?

01:10:49.461 --> 01:10:51.730
I said don't open that letter
till you read their offer.

01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:55.230
Oh, no. I won't.
Will you please open it?

01:10:58.388 --> 01:11:00.388
Ho-ho.

01:11:03.225 --> 01:11:05.010
Hello.

01:11:05.110 --> 01:11:06.745
Hi, Lily.

01:11:06.845 --> 01:11:08.681
Yep.

01:11:08.781 --> 01:11:10.649
The offer is 950.

01:11:10.749 --> 01:11:12.418
All right.

01:11:12.518 --> 01:11:14.220
Yeah. Okay.
All right.

01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:15.821
- That's good.
- 950?

01:11:15.921 --> 01:11:18.224
Mm-hmm. Fine.
That's good.

01:11:18.324 --> 01:11:20.185
All right. Bye.
- That is absolutely wonderful.

01:11:20.285 --> 01:11:21.278
We can make this work.

01:11:21.378 --> 01:11:23.262
Is Lily gonna call them
and give them the good news?

01:11:23.362 --> 01:11:24.863
She's gonna call the others first...

01:11:24.963 --> 01:11:28.788
...and see if they wanna
make a counteroffer.

01:11:31.755 --> 01:11:34.340
Yeah?

01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:37.579
What? No.
Tell 'em they can keep their...

01:11:37.679 --> 01:11:39.545
...lousy thousand dollars.

01:11:39.645 --> 01:11:41.947
Hang on. Hang on.

01:11:42.047 --> 01:11:43.949
What? Lily?
Lily, what happened?

01:11:44.049 --> 01:11:46.939
The Matching Sweaters offered 951.

01:11:46.952 --> 01:11:49.587
But here's the good news.
Dr. Gilbert's gonna e-mail you...

01:11:49.687 --> 01:11:50.340
...a counteroffer.

01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:53.092
Okay.
But who is Dr. Gilbert?

01:11:53.192 --> 01:11:55.192
Blue Leggings.
Oh, no.

01:11:55.194 --> 01:11:57.263
Let me know what it is
as soon as you get it.

01:11:57.363 --> 01:11:58.703
We have to get over to the other place...

01:11:58.803 --> 01:11:59.316
...in half an hour.

01:11:59.416 --> 01:12:02.034
Okay. Thanks.
Bye.

01:12:02.134 --> 01:12:03.830
Will you check the e-mail?

01:12:03.930 --> 01:12:04.254
Yeah.

01:12:04.354 --> 01:12:06.989
I know how to use the Internet.

01:12:11.427 --> 01:12:13.427
Ooh.

01:12:19.168 --> 01:12:20.953
'Dear Mr. and Mrs. Carver.

01:12:21.053 --> 01:12:22.595
My partner and I moved to New York...

01:12:22.695 --> 01:12:23.573
...only a few years ago,

01:12:23.673 --> 01:12:25.824
and as you probably know
better than most,

01:12:25.924 --> 01:12:28.160
it's not always been easy for us.

01:12:28.260 --> 01:12:30.129
We've been trying to adopt
for nearly six years,

01:12:30.229 --> 01:12:34.216
and it looks like we'll finally
have a baby daughter,

01:12:34.316 --> 01:12:36.735
a little girl from India.

01:12:36.835 --> 01:12:41.168
Your husband's studio would make
such a wonderful room for her.

01:12:41.268 --> 01:12:42.559
full of light and love.

01:12:42.659 --> 01:12:44.677
Please consider letting us live
in your wonderful home.'

01:12:44.777 --> 01:12:45.811
Shit.

01:12:45.911 --> 01:12:47.846
Honey, what?
Ruth, do this.

01:12:47.946 --> 01:12:50.037
Um-- No, let me get it.

01:12:50.137 --> 01:12:52.137
Let me get it for you.

01:12:52.184 --> 01:12:53.237
Honey, it's okay.
It's okay.

01:12:53.337 --> 01:12:53.703
You do it.

01:12:53.803 --> 01:12:55.287
You do it.
It's all right.

01:12:55.387 --> 01:12:57.387
Got it. Got it. Got it.

01:13:01.410 --> 01:13:03.762
Okay. Well, Blue Leggings made an offer.

01:13:03.862 --> 01:13:05.464
What is it?

01:13:05.564 --> 01:13:07.166
960.

01:13:07.266 --> 01:13:08.967
Nine-- That's good.

01:13:09.067 --> 01:13:10.869
Uh-- I don't know.
Yeah.

01:13:10.969 --> 01:13:12.438
What?
You're disappointed?

01:13:12.538 --> 01:13:14.139
No. It's just--...

01:13:14.239 --> 01:13:16.709
...   Honey, I read the Dog Ladies' letter,

01:13:16.809 --> 01:13:18.784
and I just think we should give them...

01:13:18.884 --> 01:13:20.230
...a chance to counteroffer.

01:13:20.330 --> 01:13:22.330
Just-- Ruth.

01:13:22.381 --> 01:13:26.352
You heard that lady say
this was their final offer.

01:13:26.452 --> 01:13:28.487
See, I told you not to read that letter.

01:13:28.587 --> 01:13:31.890
I know. But they're adopting
a little girl. I--...

01:13:31.990 --> 01:13:34.993
... These people are offering $10,000 more.

01:13:35.093 --> 01:13:36.820
But do we really want
someone like that living here?

01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:37.113
Honey.

01:13:37.213 --> 01:13:38.831
Do we?
I'm just asking.

01:13:38.931 --> 01:13:41.800
Ruth,
we're talking 10 grand.

01:13:41.900 --> 01:13:43.999
All day we've been throwing
numbers back and forth...

01:13:44.099 --> 01:13:45.288
...like they don't mean anything.

01:13:45.388 --> 01:13:47.473
850.900.950.

01:13:47.573 --> 01:13:49.842
Sugar, we're not rich.

01:13:49.942 --> 01:13:51.677
We need to get a grip on reality here.

01:13:51.777 --> 01:13:53.057
I know.
You're right.

01:13:53.157 --> 01:13:53.697
It's just--...

01:13:53.797 --> 01:13:55.314
...   I wish we could give it to them.

01:13:55.414 --> 01:13:58.250
I wish a lot of things.

01:13:58.350 --> 01:14:00.461
I wish we could give our apartment...

01:14:00.561 --> 01:14:01.838
...to whoever needed it.

01:14:01.938 --> 01:14:04.792
I wish we could give it
to that lady on the bed...

01:14:04.892 --> 01:14:05.942
...and her little girl.

01:14:06.042 --> 01:14:09.895
Most of all, I wish I could run
up and down the damn stairs,

01:14:09.995 --> 01:14:13.310
like I used to,
for the rest of my life.

01:14:19.956 --> 01:14:21.340
Okay.

01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:22.450
It's right there.
It's right here.

01:14:22.550 --> 01:14:22.792
Where--.

01:14:22.892 --> 01:14:25.782
I got it. I got it.
Oh, here it is.

01:14:26.995 --> 01:14:29.281
Hello?

01:14:29.381 --> 01:14:30.916
Yes. Yes, Doctor.

01:14:31.016 --> 01:14:33.385
What?

01:14:33.485 --> 01:14:35.485
What?
Really?

01:14:35.487 --> 01:14:37.122
What? What? What?

01:14:37.222 --> 01:14:39.222
Really?

01:14:39.975 --> 01:14:41.975
Oh.

01:14:43.846 --> 01:14:45.397
- She walked.
- She walked?

01:14:45.497 --> 01:14:46.932
- She walked?
- Yes.

01:14:47.032 --> 01:14:48.567
Dorothy walked.

01:14:48.667 --> 01:14:51.370
I knew she would.
High five.

01:14:51.470 --> 01:14:53.470
Oh.
Yes.

01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:04.583
Let me tell you.
What?

01:15:04.683 --> 01:15:06.129
Once I give them this check--.

01:15:06.229 --> 01:15:06.503
Yeah?

01:15:06.603 --> 01:15:07.681
there's no turning back.

01:15:07.781 --> 01:15:08.071
I know.

01:15:08.171 --> 01:15:09.721
It's all-- Everything is different.

01:15:09.821 --> 01:15:11.323
Good different, honey.
Good different.

01:15:11.423 --> 01:15:12.891
We'll see. We'll see.
We'll see. Now wait.

01:15:12.991 --> 01:15:15.060
It's, uh-- Okay, here it is.

01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:16.762
Who is it?

01:15:16.862 --> 01:15:20.772
Oh. My husband and I
are here with the deposit.

01:15:21.950 --> 01:15:23.969
Hello? Hello there.

01:15:24.069 --> 01:15:26.018
You sure you got the right apartment?

01:15:26.118 --> 01:15:26.856
I'm sure. Yeah.

01:15:26.956 --> 01:15:29.274
Hello?
We've come to buy...

01:15:29.374 --> 01:15:30.642
...the apartment.

01:15:30.742 --> 01:15:32.978
Yes. We're-- Your broker.

01:15:33.078 --> 01:15:35.481
We're meeting your broker.
She told us to meet her here.

01:15:35.581 --> 01:15:38.116
I know who you are.
Your agent isn't here yet.

01:15:38.216 --> 01:15:39.845
You can wait for her outside.

01:15:39.945 --> 01:15:40.770
Oh, that's nice.

01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:42.921
You know what I'm gonna do?
I am going to call Lily.

01:15:43.021 --> 01:15:44.477
No, no.
Here comes somebody.

01:15:44.577 --> 01:15:45.442
'Cause that's rude.

01:15:45.542 --> 01:15:47.542
Oh. Oh, good.

01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:50.596
Oh, God. That was just--.

01:15:50.696 --> 01:15:53.098
I'm calling Lily.

01:15:53.198 --> 01:15:55.198
Lily. Oh.

01:15:58.086 --> 01:15:59.972
It's showtime.
Oh.

01:16:00.072 --> 01:16:01.707
Okay.

01:16:01.807 --> 01:16:03.302
I don't want to take it.
I want to wait.

01:16:03.402 --> 01:16:03.960
We can't wait.

01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:05.677
Who the hell is that?

01:16:05.777 --> 01:16:08.814
That's their agent.
I said not later than 5:00.

01:16:08.914 --> 01:16:10.482
I'm coming.

01:16:10.582 --> 01:16:13.018
For Christ's sake.

01:16:13.118 --> 01:16:14.058
Great. They've been holding us hostage...

01:16:14.158 --> 01:16:14.437
...all afternoon.

01:16:14.537 --> 01:16:16.054
Now they can't wait to get in.

01:16:16.154 --> 01:16:17.990
Hi.
Hi. How did you get in?

01:16:18.090 --> 01:16:19.558
Uh-- The--...

01:16:19.658 --> 01:16:21.193
...   Gentleman with a dog.

01:16:21.293 --> 01:16:23.161
Oh. So much for security.
Come on in.

01:16:23.261 --> 01:16:24.830
Oh. Thank you,
I guess.

01:16:24.930 --> 01:16:27.232
This is Mrs. Carver.
This is Mr. Carver.

01:16:27.332 --> 01:16:28.834
I'm Lily Portman.

01:16:28.934 --> 01:16:30.469
Hi. How are you?

01:16:30.569 --> 01:16:32.471
Oh, hi. I'm Lily Portman.
How are you?

01:16:32.571 --> 01:16:36.258
I need to talk to my wife.
This is Mrs. Carver.

01:16:36.358 --> 01:16:38.877
Sure. Uh, let's just go inside then.

01:16:38.977 --> 01:16:39.978
Okay.
Great.

01:16:40.078 --> 01:16:42.078
Thank you.

01:16:43.565 --> 01:16:44.713
I don't want to take the offer.

01:16:44.813 --> 01:16:45.768
We don't have to take it.

01:16:45.868 --> 01:16:47.386
I'm telling you.
I know. Fine. Okay.

01:16:47.486 --> 01:16:50.088
Okay.
Let's get down to business.

01:16:50.188 --> 01:16:51.757
Hey, Miriam.
Hello.

01:16:51.857 --> 01:16:53.990
So we, uh-- We have the deposit check.

01:16:54.090 --> 01:16:54.377
Great.

01:16:54.477 --> 01:16:57.162
- What if we refuse it?
- Why would you refuse it?

01:16:57.262 --> 01:16:58.679
Hold on.
- 'Cause maybe we want to...

01:16:58.779 --> 01:16:59.782
...open the bidding back up.

01:16:59.882 --> 01:17:02.568
Why would you want to do that?
So we can get better offers.

01:17:02.668 --> 01:17:03.918
These two have been holding us hostage...

01:17:04.018 --> 01:17:04.387
...all afternoon.

01:17:04.487 --> 01:17:06.071
Nobody's been holding you hostage.

01:17:06.171 --> 01:17:09.775
Okay. All right.
Relax, everybody.

01:17:09.875 --> 01:17:12.466
They're here now,
and this is the best offer...

01:17:12.566 --> 01:17:13.396
...you've gotten.

01:17:13.496 --> 01:17:16.081
Especially while all that shit
drags on out there.

01:17:16.181 --> 01:17:19.126
If you refuse my clients' check,
it will be up to the courts...

01:17:19.226 --> 01:17:19.702
...to decide.

01:17:19.802 --> 01:17:21.195
Your kid could be out of
college by the time...

01:17:21.295 --> 01:17:21.971
...this thing is resolved.

01:17:22.071 --> 01:17:24.071
Is that what you want?

01:17:25.841 --> 01:17:28.360
Take his damn check.
Okay.

01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:30.460
This way.

01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:33.298
Do they even know
what they're doing?

01:17:33.398 --> 01:17:35.523
We know what we're doing.

01:17:39.921 --> 01:17:41.540
Who do I make it out to?

01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:43.709
Stephen Vincent.

01:17:43.809 --> 01:17:45.143
Is that 'P-H' or a 'V'?

01:17:45.243 --> 01:17:47.243
'P-H.'

01:17:51.968 --> 01:17:54.178
Oh, something's happening.

01:17:54.703 --> 01:17:56.088
Oh.

01:17:56.188 --> 01:17:57.823
It's the terrorist thing.

01:17:57.923 --> 01:17:59.491
What's happening?

01:17:59.591 --> 01:18:01.684
It looks like they-they-- they found him...

01:18:01.784 --> 01:18:02.512
...or something.

01:18:02.612 --> 01:18:04.663
Logan, what do you see?
Oh, my God.

01:18:04.763 --> 01:18:08.000
...that the suspect in this
terrorism plot, Abdul Pamir--.

01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:09.635
In fact, there he is right now.

01:18:09.735 --> 01:18:11.503
That's him.
He's coming out.

01:18:11.603 --> 01:18:13.188
He has his hands over his head.

01:18:13.288 --> 01:18:13.523
Wow.

01:18:13.623 --> 01:18:16.173
He appears to be surrendering.

01:18:16.208 --> 01:18:18.018
Now police are sending in a canine unit...

01:18:18.118 --> 01:18:19.062
...to sniff the suspect...

01:18:19.162 --> 01:18:22.347
...  to see if there is actually
a bomb or device.

01:18:22.447 --> 01:18:24.850
Wait a second.
He seems very calm.

01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:26.818
That might be a bomb there though.

01:18:26.918 --> 01:18:29.092
The dog has walked off now.
That means there is likely...

01:18:29.192 --> 01:18:29.973
...no device, no bomb.

01:18:30.073 --> 01:18:31.790
Get him off the streets for good.

01:18:31.890 --> 01:18:34.526
Very, very good news indeed.
- That's his white flag. Wow.

01:18:34.626 --> 01:18:36.428
It's good they got him.
- Lock him up.

01:18:36.528 --> 01:18:39.197
Now you can hear the choppers
up ahead as well.

01:18:39.297 --> 01:18:41.500
New York City's finest is doing their job,

01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:44.803
and they have got their man
and they are about to--...

01:18:44.903 --> 01:18:46.430
...  Just shoot the son of a bitch.

01:18:46.530 --> 01:18:47.290
Right in the balls.

01:18:47.390 --> 01:18:49.107
Oh, come on.
Look at him.

01:18:49.207 --> 01:18:50.642
Heck, he's-- He's just a kid.

01:18:50.742 --> 01:18:52.210
Well, what did you expect?

01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:54.513
Well, I don't know.
A monster.

01:18:54.613 --> 01:18:57.482
Anything but this.
What did he really do?

01:18:57.582 --> 01:18:58.577
The little prick cost me 50 grand.

01:18:58.677 --> 01:18:59.235
That's what he did.

01:18:59.335 --> 01:19:01.319
Just leave it.
You need to let it go.

01:19:01.419 --> 01:19:03.086
We can all rest easier now,
knowing this terrorist...

01:19:03.186 --> 01:19:03.740
...is off our streets.

01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:05.457
Isn't it a little bit too early...

01:19:05.557 --> 01:19:07.993
...to actually convict this young man?

01:19:08.093 --> 01:19:09.728
He's just some poor guy.

01:19:09.828 --> 01:19:12.464
Poor guy, my ass.
- I knew we should have waited.

01:19:12.564 --> 01:19:13.966
You are the one that said to take...

01:19:14.066 --> 01:19:15.284
...the first decent offer we got.

01:19:15.384 --> 01:19:17.703
I remind you, you are obligated
to take my clients' offer.

01:19:17.803 --> 01:19:19.371
Yes?
- Yes.

01:19:19.471 --> 01:19:21.540
All right. Just sign the thing already.

01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:26.044
Just sign where indicated,
Mr. Carver.

01:19:26.144 --> 01:19:28.144
I'm not signing.

01:19:29.397 --> 01:19:31.149
Alex-- Are you all right?

01:19:31.249 --> 01:19:33.385
What do you mean,
you're not signing it?

01:19:33.485 --> 01:19:36.715
I mean I'm not signing the damn thing.
