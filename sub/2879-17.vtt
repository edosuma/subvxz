00:00.858 --> 00:03.006
<i>Previously</i>
<i>on</i> The Big Bang Theory...

00:03.205 --> 00:05.772
Can I have your attention,
please?

00:05.774 --> 00:09.660
We're all here tonight because
we have no one to be with.

00:09.662 --> 00:11.462
We've got to stop defining

00:11.464 --> 00:16.116
our self-worth by whether or not
we're in a relationship.

00:16.117 --> 00:20.287
We are a community, and as long

00:20.289 --> 00:23.957
as we have each other,
we're never truly alone.

00:27.512 --> 00:29.513
That was cool.

00:29.515 --> 00:30.731
What you said.

00:30.733 --> 00:32.900
Thank you.

00:34.736 --> 00:37.471
Uh... would you like
to, uh...

00:37.473 --> 00:40.640
get a cup...
a cup of coffee...?

00:40.642 --> 00:41.975
Okay.

00:47.198 --> 00:49.400
Later, losers!

00:52.120 --> 00:54.672
So then I went to Cambridge,
which was wonderful

00:54.674 --> 00:56.924
not only because
it's a good school

00:56.926 --> 01:00.794
but because it totally
looks like Hogwarts.

01:00.796 --> 01:02.546
That's where I fell in
love with astronomy,

01:02.548 --> 01:05.349
and now I'm an
astrophysicist at Caltech,

01:05.351 --> 01:07.718
so I guess you could say, uh,

01:07.720 --> 01:11.171
Raj is my name and
stars are my game.

01:11.173 --> 01:14.641
And rhyming is also my game.

01:14.643 --> 01:18.445
So, uh, two games.

01:18.447 --> 01:19.897
Uh, anyway, that-that's
enough about me.

01:19.899 --> 01:22.066
I want to hear
everything about you.

01:22.917 --> 01:24.868
I have to go
to the bathroom.

01:24.870 --> 01:27.955
I go to the
bathroom, too.

01:27.957 --> 01:30.741
Sometimes more frequently
than I care to admit.

01:30.743 --> 01:34.495
Oh, I've had it checked out,
it's nothing.

01:35.830 --> 01:39.216
Hmm! This is going great!

01:40.135 --> 01:43.870
Mmm... can I have a refill
on my chai tea?

01:43.872 --> 01:45.322
Yes...

01:45.324 --> 01:47.624
I have a good feeling
about this.

01:50.478 --> 01:52.663
I should have bought condoms.

02:24.597 --> 02:28.316
Hello, I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

02:28.318 --> 02:31.986
Welcome to <i>Sheldon Cooper</i>
<i>Presents: Fun with Flags.</i>

02:35.374 --> 02:38.109
My apologies that this episode
is coming late.

02:38.111 --> 02:41.379
I did shoot one last week,
in honor of Black History Month,

02:41.381 --> 02:43.248
but I was informed
by my roommate

02:43.250 --> 02:46.084
that my spot-on portrayal
of George Washington Carver

02:46.086 --> 02:49.320
could be considered
"wildly racist."

02:51.040 --> 02:52.957
My heart goes out to the members

02:52.959 --> 02:54.926
of the African-American
community,

02:54.928 --> 02:58.263
who, like me,
have been kept down by The Man.

03:00.199 --> 03:04.702
Now, <i>Fun with Flags</i> is not just
for the flag aficionado;

03:04.704 --> 03:08.306
it's also for the flag novice,
so, to help me with that,

03:08.308 --> 03:11.943
please welcome my friend,
neighbor, and flag virgin--

03:11.945 --> 03:14.212
yeah, not a real virgin.

03:15.781 --> 03:17.949
She's had coitus many times.

03:19.418 --> 03:23.971
Sometimes within earshot
of this flag enthusiast.

03:23.973 --> 03:26.758
Once while he was trying
to watch <i>The Incredibles.</i>

03:27.760 --> 03:30.328
Penny.

03:30.330 --> 03:32.330
Hello.

03:32.332 --> 03:33.781
So, Penny, I understand

03:33.783 --> 03:36.167
you would like to learn
more about flags.

03:36.169 --> 03:37.869
Yeah, I can't tell you
how many times

03:37.871 --> 03:39.838
I've been at a party where
everyone's talking about flags

03:39.840 --> 03:42.757
and I just couldn't join in.
Yeah.

03:42.759 --> 03:44.976
Well, you came to
the right place.

03:48.214 --> 03:52.183
Uh, I'm sorry, can we
just pause for a minute?

03:52.185 --> 03:54.052
What's wrong?

03:54.054 --> 03:55.637
I just think
it might look more natural

03:55.639 --> 03:57.838
if you talked to me
instead of the camera,

03:57.840 --> 03:59.774
you know, like,
like a real conversation.

03:59.776 --> 04:01.860
It's something we work on
in my acting class.

04:01.862 --> 04:03.111
Interesting.

04:03.113 --> 04:05.780
A few people in the
comments section have said

04:05.782 --> 04:08.316
that my delivery
is robotic.

04:10.186 --> 04:12.487
Perhaps that isn't the
compliment it sounds like.

04:12.489 --> 04:15.240
Yeah, let's try it again,
and maybe, this time,

04:15.242 --> 04:17.375
you could work
on your body language a bit.

04:17.377 --> 04:19.627
You know, when you're
all hunched like that,

04:19.629 --> 04:20.879
you're shutting
the audience out,

04:20.880 --> 04:23.081
but when you're relaxed
and open,

04:23.083 --> 04:24.582
you're inviting them in.

04:24.584 --> 04:26.200
Right.

04:26.202 --> 04:29.754
And which one do I want?

04:29.756 --> 04:31.806
Let's try open.

04:31.808 --> 04:33.925
If our friend, the flag,
has taught me anything,

04:33.927 --> 04:36.311
it's to go where
the wind takes you.

04:36.313 --> 04:39.013
As long as you remain firmly
attached to a rigid pole.

04:40.316 --> 04:42.183
And... action.

04:44.000 --> 04:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:52.144 --> 04:53.912
So, Penny...

04:53.914 --> 04:58.116
what sort of flag questions
keep you awake at night?

05:03.272 --> 05:05.473
Um, well, I'm from Nebraska.

05:05.475 --> 05:07.692
So what can you tell me
about the state flag?

05:07.694 --> 05:10.545
Gosh, Penny...

05:10.547 --> 05:12.397
what'd you have
for breakfast?

05:12.399 --> 05:16.217
A big glass of
good question juice?

05:16.219 --> 05:19.604
The Nebraska state flag
is simply the state seal

05:19.606 --> 05:22.440
on a field of blue.

05:34.103 --> 05:36.571
Spread your legs;
invite them in.

05:41.627 --> 05:43.544
I'm telling you,
something's wrong.

05:43.546 --> 05:46.280
I can always feel it
when Raj is in trouble.

05:46.282 --> 05:48.916
Geez, how close were you guys
before we got married?

05:48.918 --> 05:50.918
Don't look under that rock.

05:52.255 --> 05:53.388
Raj, you okay?

05:53.390 --> 05:54.422
You in there?

05:54.424 --> 05:55.757
Go away!

05:56.725 --> 05:58.059
Come on, buddy, open up.

05:58.061 --> 05:59.477
We're worried about you.

05:59.479 --> 06:01.596
Oh, just because I
stopped going to work

06:01.598 --> 06:05.016
and answering my phone you
think something bad happened?

06:05.018 --> 06:07.802
Maybe something
good happened.

06:07.804 --> 06:09.637
Did something good happen?

06:09.639 --> 06:10.805
Of course not!

06:10.807 --> 06:14.141
Nothing good ever happens!

06:17.979 --> 06:19.530
Whoa.

06:19.532 --> 06:20.999
What?

06:21.001 --> 06:22.983
Nope, just-just... whoa.

06:28.674 --> 06:31.926
It smells pretty ripe in here.

06:31.928 --> 06:35.847
You kind feel it in your eyes.

06:36.715 --> 06:37.949
Raj, what's going on?

06:37.951 --> 06:41.386
I was humiliated
by yet another woman.

06:41.388 --> 06:43.438
You didn't kill her
and chop her up--

06:43.440 --> 06:44.806
that's not what we're
smelling, right?

06:44.808 --> 06:46.774
No.

06:46.776 --> 06:48.693
I took her for coffee,

06:48.695 --> 06:51.029
and she snuck
out the bathroom window

06:51.031 --> 06:52.146
to get away from me.

06:52.148 --> 06:53.798
Oh, you poor baby.

06:53.800 --> 06:55.450
I went and looked.

06:55.452 --> 06:57.652
It was a high and tiny window.

06:58.437 --> 07:00.905
She must have been
very motivated.

07:02.274 --> 07:04.625
I'm sorry.
That's awful, but come on.

07:04.627 --> 07:06.360
you got to shake it off.

07:06.362 --> 07:07.829
Yeah, you can't stay
in your apartment

07:07.831 --> 07:09.196
for the rest of your life.

07:09.198 --> 07:10.498
Why not?

07:10.500 --> 07:12.967
With online shopping
and overnight delivery,

07:12.969 --> 07:14.302
I can get anything I want.

07:14.304 --> 07:15.636
Look,

07:15.638 --> 07:16.971
I just ordered a case

07:16.973 --> 07:18.556
of Dinty Moore beef stew

07:18.558 --> 07:21.642
and two live lobsters on Amazon.

07:21.644 --> 07:23.061
Lobsters overnight?

07:23.063 --> 07:24.479
Oh, you're kidding.
Let me see.

07:24.481 --> 07:26.064
Well, I'll be.

07:26.066 --> 07:27.765
Look, you can throw
in a couple steaks

07:27.767 --> 07:29.550
and have a surf and turf.

07:30.335 --> 07:31.602
The surf and turf sounds good.

07:31.604 --> 07:34.355
See if they corn on the cob.

07:34.357 --> 07:35.857
Guys!

07:35.859 --> 07:37.442
We're trying to get him
out of here,

07:37.444 --> 07:38.943
not you in.

07:38.945 --> 07:40.778
You're wasting
your time.

07:40.780 --> 07:43.748
Just please,
leave me alone.

07:47.904 --> 07:49.087
Now what?

07:49.089 --> 07:50.905
I don't know.

07:50.907 --> 07:54.241
We could go to Red Lobster
and talk about it.

07:55.243 --> 07:56.961
We're all thinking it.

07:56.963 --> 07:59.514
I just had the decency to wait
for him to leave.

08:06.072 --> 08:08.439
Hello, Sheldon.

08:08.441 --> 08:09.557
Hello.

08:09.559 --> 08:11.058
How's the final stage

08:11.060 --> 08:13.294
of your nicotine
addiction study going?

08:13.296 --> 08:14.862
Fine.

08:14.864 --> 08:16.864
Just hold on.

08:16.866 --> 08:19.033
Mommy's on the phone!

08:20.319 --> 08:21.819
Sorry.

08:21.821 --> 08:24.655
We've cut the monkeys down
to one cigarette a day,

08:24.657 --> 08:26.440
so things are a little intense.

08:27.526 --> 08:29.710
Makes me miss
my marijuana-abusing flatworms.

08:29.712 --> 08:32.380
Those guys were mellow.

08:32.381 --> 08:34.081
Good news.

08:34.082 --> 08:37.418
Uh, the latest episode
of <i>Fun with Flags</i> is online.

08:37.419 --> 08:39.337
Oh, that's right.
How'd it go with Penny?

08:39.339 --> 08:40.938
Much better than I expected.

08:40.940 --> 08:43.624
She even gave me
some helpful tips

08:43.626 --> 08:45.510
about acting and body language.

08:45.512 --> 08:47.461
Watch.

08:48.296 --> 08:50.648
Welcome to my world.

08:50.650 --> 08:53.534
Not welcome to my world.

08:54.753 --> 08:55.987
Welcome.

08:55.989 --> 08:58.306
Not welcome.

08:58.308 --> 09:01.075
Subtle, but powerful.

09:01.077 --> 09:02.310
I know.

09:02.312 --> 09:04.979
I'm still learning
to control it.

09:04.981 --> 09:07.198
Did you tell Penny
how helpful she was?

09:07.200 --> 09:08.816
Why would I do that?

09:08.818 --> 09:12.486
Because she's your friend,
and she did a nice job.

09:12.488 --> 09:14.038
I'm sure she'd like to hear it.

09:14.040 --> 09:16.924
All right.

09:17.793 --> 09:20.194
I didn't mean now. Hello?

09:21.965 --> 09:23.731
Yeah, yeah,
you want a cigarette.

09:23.733 --> 09:25.032
Well,
I'd like a normal boyfriend.

09:25.034 --> 09:27.552
Deal with it.

09:29.805 --> 09:30.888
Oh, hi. What's up?

09:30.890 --> 09:33.507
Um...

09:33.509 --> 09:35.209
You need me to shut the door

09:35.211 --> 09:37.612
so you can do
your knocking thing?

09:38.397 --> 09:40.031
No.

09:40.033 --> 09:41.348
I didn't start yet; it's fine.

09:41.350 --> 09:43.451
Okay. So, what do you need?

09:43.453 --> 09:45.152
Well, I was thinking

09:45.154 --> 09:47.521
about you helping me
out last night...

09:47.523 --> 09:50.291
Penny.

09:52.160 --> 09:54.962
And I just wanted to tell you...

09:54.964 --> 09:56.214
Penny.

09:56.216 --> 10:00.001
...that the answer
to the question,

10:00.003 --> 10:02.587
"Who did a great job?" is you.

10:03.371 --> 10:05.840
Penny.

10:05.842 --> 10:07.592
Really?

10:07.594 --> 10:10.210
Yes, you were very natural
in front of the camera,

10:10.212 --> 10:13.064
and I found your suggestions
extremely helpful.

10:13.066 --> 10:16.216
Aw, sweetie,
you just made my day.

10:16.218 --> 10:17.718
Okay.

10:17.720 --> 10:21.522
Hey, my acting class is putting
on a play Friday night.

10:21.524 --> 10:23.608
I could put you and Amy
on the guest list.

10:23.610 --> 10:24.892
Oh, that sounds terrible.

10:24.894 --> 10:27.227
Why would I want to do that?

10:28.297 --> 10:29.730
That's right.

10:29.732 --> 10:33.701
They're no good
without the lighter.

10:33.703 --> 10:36.837
Well, so much for your advice
on complimenting Penny.

10:36.839 --> 10:38.572
Why? What happened?

10:38.574 --> 10:39.674
She tried to rope us into going

10:39.676 --> 10:41.408
to her acting class
to see a play.

10:41.410 --> 10:42.543
Don't worry.

10:42.545 --> 10:43.711
Luckily, I had the good sense

10:43.713 --> 10:47.098
to drown that kitten
in the river.

10:47.100 --> 10:50.301
Sheldon, that's very rude.

10:50.303 --> 10:51.752
She helped you with your show.

10:51.754 --> 10:53.421
The right thing to do
is reciprocate

10:53.423 --> 10:54.889
by going to see her play.

10:54.891 --> 10:56.885
Oh, so many crazy rules.

11:01.715 --> 11:03.044
That better be Tootsie Rolls

11:03.069 --> 11:04.241
you're throwing at me!

11:07.670 --> 11:09.453
Penny. Penny.

11:09.455 --> 11:11.038
Penny.

11:11.040 --> 11:12.673
Oh yeah, much better.

11:14.842 --> 11:15.825
What?

11:15.827 --> 11:17.160
Amy pointed out to me

11:17.162 --> 11:19.463
that since you did
something nice for me,

11:19.465 --> 11:22.216
I'm obligated to do
something nice for you.

11:22.218 --> 11:23.467
So...

11:23.469 --> 11:26.470
yes, I'll go
to your dopey play.

11:27.722 --> 11:29.339
Hey, I don't want you
to go anymore.

11:29.341 --> 11:30.807
Why not?

11:30.809 --> 11:31.892
You should go 'cause
you want to go,

11:31.894 --> 11:33.026
not because you have to.

11:33.028 --> 11:35.178
Oh, Dear Lord, more rules?
Where does it stop?

11:36.281 --> 11:38.815
Can I want to go

11:38.817 --> 11:41.902
because I have to want to go?

11:41.904 --> 11:43.620
Okay. Do whatever you want.

11:43.622 --> 11:45.322
Yeah, but now, wait.

11:45.324 --> 11:47.357
Do whatever I want...

11:47.359 --> 11:50.460
or whatever I have to want?

11:51.462 --> 11:53.463
Oh, for God's sake,
just come to the play.

11:53.465 --> 11:54.798
All right.

11:54.800 --> 11:57.251
I don't want to, but
at least that makes sense.

12:06.757 --> 12:10.353
You know, I haven't seen
Raj in several days.

12:10.354 --> 12:13.555
Is he no longer a part
of our social group?

12:13.557 --> 12:16.575
And if so, should we be
interviewing for a replacement?

12:18.044 --> 12:20.646
Perhaps, this time, we go Latin.

12:24.200 --> 12:27.419
He's just decided he's never
leaving his apartment again.

12:27.421 --> 12:28.870
Oh, brilliant.

12:28.872 --> 12:31.640
I've been itching
to pull that trigger.

12:31.642 --> 12:35.110
He's upset because he can't
get anywhere with women.

12:36.379 --> 12:38.580
Would it help if I gave
him some pointers?

12:43.420 --> 12:45.387
I'm just funnin' ya.

12:50.577 --> 12:51.660
Hi.

12:51.662 --> 12:52.945
I don't know if you remember me,

12:52.947 --> 12:55.114
but I was here the other night
at your party.

12:55.116 --> 12:57.666
Oh, yeah, you left with Raj.

12:57.668 --> 13:00.068
Uh, yeah.

13:00.070 --> 13:01.720
You're the one?

13:01.722 --> 13:03.071
Okay, let me tell you something.

13:03.073 --> 13:04.840
That guy you blew off

13:04.842 --> 13:07.259
happens to be my best friend.

13:07.261 --> 13:08.877
Okay?
He was devastated.

13:08.879 --> 13:11.046
Sorry.

13:11.048 --> 13:12.581
Can you just give him this?

13:12.583 --> 13:14.550
Okay.

13:14.552 --> 13:15.851
But I gotta warn you,

13:15.853 --> 13:19.304
Raj is a proud, passionate man.

13:19.306 --> 13:21.607
If you go running out
on him again,

13:21.609 --> 13:24.943
you're only gonna get, like,
three or four more chances

13:24.945 --> 13:26.445
before you are history.

13:28.865 --> 13:30.783
Come on, she came back.

13:30.785 --> 13:31.984
This is good news.

13:31.986 --> 13:33.285
You should celebrate.

13:33.287 --> 13:35.454
I don't want to celebrate.

13:40.326 --> 13:42.544
Not even a little?

13:42.546 --> 13:44.413
I mean... we could have
a pants party.

13:44.415 --> 13:45.798
Go put some on.

13:46.633 --> 13:48.116
Why would I want her number?

13:48.118 --> 13:49.835
I don't want anything to do
with this woman.

13:49.837 --> 13:51.587
Oh, come on, Raj...
No, you don't get it.

13:51.589 --> 13:53.889
I want nothing to
do with any woman.

13:53.891 --> 13:56.091
My heart is stone.

13:57.727 --> 13:59.595
From now on, I'm a monk.

13:59.597 --> 14:02.397
I renounce
all worldly pleasures.

14:02.399 --> 14:04.016
Except for lobster.

14:05.485 --> 14:07.653
And garlic butter.

14:07.655 --> 14:10.355
Boy, I want to tell you
it's her loss,

14:10.357 --> 14:13.025
but you are not making it easy.

14:14.527 --> 14:17.863
You're-you're a good friend
for trying to help, but...

14:17.865 --> 14:19.481
I've made my choice.

14:20.533 --> 14:21.650
All right.

14:21.652 --> 14:24.086
Well, I'll see you around.

14:24.088 --> 14:26.088
See you.

14:26.090 --> 14:28.140
Oh, wait--
take her number.

14:28.142 --> 14:30.158
I don't want the temptation.

14:30.160 --> 14:32.461
Okay.

14:32.463 --> 14:34.129
I must be strong
so I don't stray

14:34.131 --> 14:35.380
from my true purpose:

14:35.382 --> 14:37.599
the study of the universe.

14:39.469 --> 14:42.504
All right.

14:48.061 --> 14:50.395
Thanks for
ruining lobster for me.

14:55.685 --> 14:56.652
Wait!

14:56.654 --> 14:58.019
Give me the number!

14:59.906 --> 15:01.456
Give me
the number!

15:01.458 --> 15:03.158
Give me the number!

15:04.377 --> 15:07.646
So, Amy, what's going on
with your addiction study?

15:07.648 --> 15:11.033
Sadly, I'm no longer associated
with that project.

15:11.035 --> 15:12.217
Why? What happened?

15:12.219 --> 15:14.169
Typical bureaucratic nonsense.

15:14.171 --> 15:16.705
You can get animals addicted
to a harmful substance,

15:16.707 --> 15:18.006
you can dissect their brains,

15:18.008 --> 15:19.975
but you throw their own feces
back at them

15:19.977 --> 15:21.876
and suddenly you're
"unprofessional."

15:24.063 --> 15:25.430
I'm sorry...

15:26.382 --> 15:27.983
...that I asked.

15:29.519 --> 15:32.571
All right, let's get
this stupid play over with.

15:32.573 --> 15:33.572
Uh, hang on.

15:33.574 --> 15:34.573
Empty your pockets.

15:34.575 --> 15:35.524
Why?

15:35.526 --> 15:36.558
You know why.

15:36.560 --> 15:37.726
The Nintendo DS.

15:41.564 --> 15:43.532
And the PSP.

15:48.638 --> 15:49.788
Now the Gameboy.

15:50.707 --> 15:52.240
Aw, for Pete's sake.

15:53.543 --> 15:54.909
Can we go now?

15:54.911 --> 15:56.077
Well, is that all of it?

16:06.022 --> 16:07.489
Just set it down.

16:09.609 --> 16:11.727
Just so you know, this is
not a stupid play.

16:11.729 --> 16:14.196
<i>A Streetcar Named Desire</i>
is an American classic.

16:14.198 --> 16:16.465
It's about streetcars?

16:16.467 --> 16:19.234
Oh, great. I won't need this.

16:33.166 --> 16:34.800
Just a sec.

16:34.802 --> 16:36.969
Oh, who says "just a sec"?

16:36.971 --> 16:38.286
I hate myself!

16:43.009 --> 16:44.476
Hello.

16:44.478 --> 16:45.794
Hi.

16:45.796 --> 16:47.179
Uh, would you like to come in?

16:47.181 --> 16:49.982
Oh, no, I can't stay.

16:49.984 --> 16:51.650
Oh.

16:51.652 --> 16:53.852
I just wanted to say...

16:53.854 --> 16:56.238
I'm sorry for running
out of the coffee shop.

16:56.240 --> 16:57.305
That wasn't cool.

16:57.307 --> 16:58.440
So, uh...

16:58.442 --> 17:00.492
Yeah.

17:00.494 --> 17:02.611
I'm sorry.

17:03.446 --> 17:04.695
Wait.

17:06.115 --> 17:08.416
Can you at least tell me
what went wrong?

17:08.419 --> 17:09.818
It's okay.

17:09.819 --> 17:11.169
I can take anything.

17:11.171 --> 17:12.319
Unless it's something I did,

17:12.321 --> 17:13.372
or said, or am.

17:13.374 --> 17:14.790
'Cause those are,
like, my buttons.

17:17.377 --> 17:19.877
No, it's not any of that.

17:19.880 --> 17:21.463
It's just...

17:21.464 --> 17:23.432
I kind of have a hard time

17:23.434 --> 17:25.500
around people I don't know.

17:25.502 --> 17:26.718
Really?

17:26.720 --> 17:27.803
Then what were you doing

17:27.805 --> 17:29.187
at the comic book store
that night?

17:29.189 --> 17:32.607
I've been trying to force myself
into situations

17:32.609 --> 17:33.842
that I'm not comfortable with.

17:33.844 --> 17:36.228
I saw the flyer
in the store window,

17:36.230 --> 17:38.647
and I made myself go in.

17:38.649 --> 17:40.682
I don't even like comic books.

17:40.684 --> 17:42.016
Yeah, me neither.

17:42.018 --> 17:43.068
Then what were you doing there?

17:43.070 --> 17:45.070
I lied. I love them.

17:47.106 --> 17:48.957
I only said that
so you'd go out with me.

17:48.959 --> 17:51.710
Oh, you don't want to do that.

17:51.712 --> 17:53.128
I'm kind of broken.

17:53.130 --> 17:54.546
That's great.

17:54.548 --> 17:55.530
I'm broken, too.

17:55.532 --> 17:56.832
Oh, no, you're not.

17:56.834 --> 17:57.866
Oh, I totally am.

17:57.868 --> 17:59.167
If it wasn't
for this beer,

17:59.169 --> 18:00.702
I couldn't even talk
to you right now.

18:00.704 --> 18:01.870
I'm a wreck.

18:01.872 --> 18:04.756
There are many things
seriously wrong with me.

18:06.041 --> 18:07.592
And not quirks, either.

18:07.594 --> 18:12.431
Like... diagnosable
psychological problems.

18:13.516 --> 18:15.717
Maybe brain damage.

18:18.571 --> 18:21.890
Well, how do I know
you're not just saying that?

18:22.708 --> 18:25.226
Go out with me on one date,

18:25.228 --> 18:27.362
and I promise you, you'll see.

18:29.064 --> 18:30.064
Okay.

18:31.001 --> 18:32.334
Text me.

18:32.336 --> 18:33.752
Bye.

18:34.670 --> 18:35.954
You won't regret it.

18:35.956 --> 18:38.072
I'm the most pathetic
guy you've ever met.

18:39.909 --> 18:42.377
And that, boys and girls...

18:42.379 --> 18:44.546
is how it's done.

18:53.624 --> 18:56.557
You love her very much,
don't you?

18:56.559 --> 18:57.491
Yes.

18:57.493 --> 18:58.926
I think you have

18:58.928 --> 19:00.861
a great capacity for devotion.

19:00.863 --> 19:03.864
You'll be lonely when
she passes on, won't you?

19:06.101 --> 19:07.868
I understand
what that is.

19:07.870 --> 19:09.103
To be lonely?

19:09.105 --> 19:10.587
She's
pretty good, huh?

19:10.589 --> 19:12.039
She is.

19:12.041 --> 19:15.542
But when do they get
to the part about streetcars?

19:19.297 --> 19:20.948
...when I was a very young girl.

19:20.950 --> 19:25.085
When I was 16 years old,
I made the discovery...

19:25.087 --> 19:27.271
love.

19:28.756 --> 19:29.723
All at once,

19:29.725 --> 19:32.026
and much, much too completely.

19:33.461 --> 19:35.529
It was like you suddenly turned
a blinding light

19:35.531 --> 19:38.148
on something that had always
been half a shadow.

19:39.534 --> 19:41.769
That's how it struck
the world for me.

19:43.605 --> 19:46.156
But I was unlucky.

19:46.158 --> 19:48.075
Deluded.

19:48.077 --> 19:49.309
She's remarkable.

19:49.311 --> 19:50.494
She really is.

19:50.496 --> 19:51.745
Our Penny's a star.

19:51.747 --> 19:53.280
...and softness and
tenderness which...

19:53.282 --> 19:55.615
How can she remember
all those lines,

19:55.617 --> 19:57.668
but as a waitress,
she can't remember

19:57.670 --> 19:59.670
"no tomato" on my hamburger?
