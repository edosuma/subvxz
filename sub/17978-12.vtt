09:53.901 --> 09:55.734
I TOLD HER, YOU KNOW,
THAT I'M REALLY SORRY

09:55.767 --> 09:57.399
THAT I DIDN'T SHOW UP
FOR HER OPENING.

09:57.433 --> 09:59.133
WHAT? YOU DIDN'T
GO TO THE OPENING?

09:59.167 --> 10:00.000
NO WONDER SHE'S NOT
TALKING TO YOU.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
NO, I MEAN, COME ON.

10:02.032 --> 10:03.900
I TOLD YOU WHAT HAPPENED
AFTER THE DINNER PARTY.

10:03.934 --> 10:06.501
REALLY, I MEAN...
AND THEN...

10:06.533 --> 10:07.801
THEN, AFTER SHE GETS
THE COMMISSION

10:07.833 --> 10:09.067
AND SHE DOESN'T
TELL ME ABOUT IT?

10:09.099 --> 10:10.634
COME ON, I HAVE
A DEPARTMENT TO RUN.

10:10.666 --> 10:11.666
BETTE.

10:11.701 --> 10:12.666
WHAT?

10:12.701 --> 10:14.400
COULD YOU BE
ANY MORE SELF-SERVING

10:14.433 --> 10:15.666
AND SELF-CENTERED?

10:15.701 --> 10:18.434
WHAT? HOW IS THAT
SELF-SERVING?

10:18.466 --> 10:20.167
GIVE ME THAT.

10:20.199 --> 10:21.333
WHAT?

10:21.367 --> 10:23.800
JUST GIVE IT
TO ME.

10:23.833 --> 10:27.033
"DEAR... JODI."

I AM CHALLENGED..."

"I, UH, BELITTLE..."

10:53.033 --> 10:55.267
"AND...

IN A BOX."

11:13.067 --> 11:14.567

11:17.634 --> 11:18.600
GO AHEAD.

11:18.634 --> 11:19.634
OKAY.
GO AHEAD.

11:19.667 --> 11:22.300
OKAY.
NO, GO AHEAD.

11:22.333 --> 11:22.399
NOW YOU HAVE TO
FOLLOW UP

11:24.701 --> 11:25.900
WITH SOMETHING ROMANTIC.

11:25.934 --> 11:27.367
I SENT HER FLOWERS.

11:27.399 --> 11:29.667
FLOWERS?
THAT'S GENERIC.

11:29.701 --> 11:31.067
IS JODI GENERIC?

11:31.067 --> 11:33.366
[SIGHING]

11:33.399 --> 11:37.167
WELL, I DID HAVE THIS
ONE REALLY CRAZY IDEA.

11:37.200 --> 11:40.533
THERE'S THIS BUILDING
ON SELMA IN HOLLY--

11:40.567 --> 11:42.299
IN HOLLYWOOD...

11:42.334 --> 11:43.533
OH.

11:43.567 --> 11:44.968
IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU HAVE TO GO.

11:45.067 --> 11:47.667
YEAH, I HAVE TO
SHOW KATE HER OFFICE.

11:47.701 --> 11:49.067
WE SET UP
A PRODUCTION OFFICE

11:49.067 --> 11:50.868
FOR LEZ GIRLS.

11:50.901 --> 11:54.366
SO YOU'RE BACK WITH WOMEN, THEN?

11:54.399 --> 11:55.968
NO.

11:56.067 --> 11:57.399
WE'RE JUST
WORKING TOGETHER.

11:59.067 --> 12:00.000
DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH THAT?

12:00.000 --> 12:02.067
THAT YOU'RE BACK WITH WOMEN?

12:02.067 --> 12:03.067
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

12:03.067 --> 12:05.200
IT'S JUST, LIKE...

12:05.234 --> 12:06.934
I JUST WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY.

12:06.968 --> 12:10.300
I WANT YOU
TO BE HAPPY, TOO.

[CHUCKLING]:
HEY.

12:17.634 --> 12:20.100
ANYWAY, THANKS A MILLION
FOR YOUR HELP.

12:20.132 --> 12:21.800
CALL ME
IF YOU, UM...

SO, HONEY, UM,
SHANE AND I HAVE SOMETHING

12:40.901 --> 12:42.600
THAT WE'VE BEEN WANTING
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

12:45.634 --> 12:47.366
UH...

12:47.399 --> 12:48.334
OH, BOY.

12:48.366 --> 12:49.433
SORRY, DID THAT GET YOU?

12:49.466 --> 12:50.433
NO, NO, NO.
OOPS, MY BAD.

12:50.466 --> 12:52.267
NO, NO, NO, IT'S OKAY.

12:52.299 --> 12:53.267
ARE YOU
LISTENING TO ME?

12:53.299 --> 12:54.567
YEAH. WHAT?

12:54.600 --> 12:57.600
OKAY, WELL, YOU KNOW

12:57.634 --> 13:00.000
THAT SHANE
IS MY GIRLFRIEND...

13:02.299 --> 13:03.701
YOU DO KNOW THAT?

13:03.734 --> 13:06.200
YEAH. SO?

13:09.067 --> 13:11.333
WELL, WE WANT TO MAKE SURE
YOU'RE OKAY WITH THAT.

13:11.367 --> 13:13.433
OKAY WITH US

13:13.467 --> 13:15.534
BEING GIRLFRIENDS

13:15.567 --> 13:17.167
AND SPENDING A LOT
OF TIME TOGETHER

13:17.199 --> 13:19.600
AND REALLY...

13:19.634 --> 13:21.800
REALLY CARING ABOUT--

13:21.833 --> 13:22.800
AW, MOM...

13:22.833 --> 13:23.968
I ALREADY TOLD YOU.

13:24.067 --> 13:25.367
I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE A LEZ.

13:25.399 --> 13:26.533
I ALREADY KNOW THAT YOU ARE,

13:26.567 --> 13:27.667
BUT I DON'T
WANT MY MOM

13:27.701 --> 13:29.167
TO BE ONE.

13:32.567 --> 13:33.868
CAN I TRY?

13:33.901 --> 13:36.667
PLEASE.

13:36.701 --> 13:38.701
JARED?

13:40.200 --> 13:42.200
JARED.

13:46.334 --> 13:49.834
SO YOU'RE NOT
SO HAPPY ABOUT THIS?

13:51.133 --> 13:52.734
YOU KNOW, MAN,
I DON'T THINK

13:52.767 --> 13:54.100
YOU'RE REALLY
BEING VERY FAIR,

13:54.133 --> 13:55.399
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

13:55.433 --> 13:57.267
BECAUSE, YOUR MOM,

13:57.299 --> 13:58.868
SHE'S A PRETTY
WONDERFUL PERSON,

13:58.901 --> 14:00.000
AND SHE LOVES YOU,

14:00.000 --> 14:03.601
AND SHE LETS YOU
BE WHO YOU ARE.

14:03.633 --> 14:06.634
SO YOU DON'T WANT HER
TO BE WHO SHE IS?

14:10.868 --> 14:13.067
I MEAN, WHAT,
WOULD YOU--

14:13.067 --> 14:15.968
DO YOU NOT WANT SHAY
AS A BROTHER?

14:16.067 --> 14:17.766
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

14:17.800 --> 14:20.434
I MEAN, WE COULD
GET A HOUSE

14:20.466 --> 14:21.667
AND WE COULD
BE LIKE A FAMILY,

14:21.701 --> 14:25.466
AND-- AND YOU AND SHAY
COULD BE LIKE BROTHERS.

14:25.501 --> 14:29.067
BUT SHAY DOESN'T
LIVE WITH YOU ANYMORE.

14:29.100 --> 14:30.533
I KNOW.

14:30.567 --> 14:32.901
SO, UM, HERE IT IS.

14:32.933 --> 14:36.299
FEEL FREE TO ADD
ANY PERSONAL TOUCHES.

14:36.334 --> 14:39.200
I KNOW IT'S NOT
VERY ELEGANT.

14:39.234 --> 14:42.433
WELL, IT'S ACTUALLY
POSITIVELY SWANKY

14:42.466 --> 14:44.133
COMPARED TO WHAT
I'M USED TO.

14:44.167 --> 14:45.500
I MEAN, ON PANDORA,

14:45.533 --> 14:48.567
THE BATHROOM WAS
MY PRODUCTION OFFICE.

14:50.334 --> 14:52.868
WELL, IT'S ALL YOURS.

14:52.901 --> 14:54.167
YEAH?

MM-HMM.

14:58.801 --> 15:00.000
"DIRECTOR."

15:00.000 --> 15:03.633
DID YOU TELL JENNY?

15:03.666 --> 15:05.734
UH, NOT EXACTLY.

15:05.767 --> 15:07.367
I WANT US TO TAKE
THE STUDIO MEETING FIRST,

15:07.400 --> 15:08.634
AND ONCE
THEY'RE ON BOARD,

15:08.666 --> 15:10.266
WE CAN TELL THEM
WE NEED TO FIRE JENNY

15:10.300 --> 15:11.433
AND BUY HER
OUT OF HER CONTRACT.

15:11.467 --> 15:12.666
IS SHE GOING TO BE
AT THE MEETING?

15:12.701 --> 15:14.734
NO, NO, NO, I TOLD HER
IT WAS CANCELED.

15:14.766 --> 15:16.766
I TOLD HER

15:16.800 --> 15:18.734
THAT LORENZO
WAS OUT OF TOWN.

15:21.501 --> 15:23.934
[LAUGHS]

15:25.067 --> 15:26.634
SO IS IT BETTE?

15:26.667 --> 15:27.968
IS WHAT BETTE?

15:28.067 --> 15:30.533
THE PERSON
THAT YOU HAVE FEELINGS FOR.

15:30.567 --> 15:32.600
THE REASON
YOU COULDN'T COME HOME WITH ME

15:32.634 --> 15:33.801
THE OTHER NIGHT.

15:34.968 --> 15:37.334
WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER.

15:46.968 --> 15:49.466
IT WAS BETTE.

15:52.200 --> 15:53.667
IT WAS.

15:53.701 --> 15:55.868
SO WHY ARE YOU HELPING HER
GET BACK TOGETHER WITH JODI?

15:55.901 --> 15:57.634
I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE I FEEL GUILTY

15:57.667 --> 15:58.868
THAT I WANT HER BACK

15:58.901 --> 16:00.000
LESS THAN A YEAR
AFTER BREAKING UP.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.766
I FUCKED UP.

16:01.800 --> 16:03.367
IT WAS...

16:03.399 --> 16:04.833
IT WAS FUCKING BLOODY.
IT WAS BAD.

16:04.868 --> 16:07.067
THAT'S WHAT BREAK-UPS ARE.
THEY'RE FUCKING BLOODY.

16:07.067 --> 16:08.234
I DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT
TO COMPLICATE HER LIFE

16:08.266 --> 16:10.067
JUST BECAUSE
SHE'S MET SOMEONE ELSE.

16:10.067 --> 16:11.766
AND IF IT DOESN'T WORK OUT
BETWEEN THEM?

16:11.801 --> 16:14.734
I GUESS I'M WAITING TO SEE
ABOUT THAT, TOO.

16:14.766 --> 16:16.067
WELL, YOU KNOW,

16:16.067 --> 16:17.734

DON'T STAY

16:17.766 --> 16:19.533
ON THE OPEN MARKET
VERY LONG.

16:19.567 --> 16:20.701
SO IF YOU
WANT SOME OF THIS,

16:20.734 --> 16:21.701
YOU'D BETTER
GET IN THERE

16:21.734 --> 16:23.734

THAN LATER.

WITH REAMERS.

16:34.167 --> 16:35.267
IT'S A PRECISION TOOL,

16:35.299 --> 16:36.634
IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE A LESBIAN,

16:36.667 --> 16:37.868
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
GET TO KNOW YOUR TOOL KIT.

16:37.901 --> 16:39.868
TECHNICALLY, A TOOL
FOR ENLARGING HOLES,

16:39.901 --> 16:43.067
WHICH IS NOT NECESSARILY
THE ANALOGY I WOULD HAVE CHOSEN,

BUT ONE RARELY GETS TO CHOOSE
ONE'S OWN ENDEARING EPITHET.

16:46.933 --> 16:48.200
I KNOW.

16:48.234 --> 16:49.901

OH, BETTE, TELL HER.

16:49.933 --> 16:51.734
WELL, PHYLLIS,

IN TOWN TO HELP YOU

17:04.634 --> 17:06.200

ABOUT TO GO THROUGH.

17:06.234 --> 17:07.634
SHE GOT ME AND TINA THROUGH
A HIDEOUS CUSTODY BATTLE.

17:07.666 --> 17:08.933
HOW IS TINA,

17:08.968 --> 17:10.433
BY THE WAY?

17:10.467 --> 17:12.634
SHE'S BACK IN THE FOLD,
ACTUALLY.

OF COURSE SHE IS.

PLEASE DON'T TELL ME
THE TWO OF YOU

17:18.167 --> 17:19.199
ARE GETTING
BACK TOGETHER.

17:19.234 --> 17:21.067
NO, SHE'S MET SOMEONE ELSE.

17:21.067 --> 17:22.300
AND SO HAS BETTE.

17:22.333 --> 17:23.667
OH, REALLY?
WELL, GOOD FOR YOU.

17:23.701 --> 17:24.867
BUT SHE'S BLOWING IT.

17:24.900 --> 17:26.900
SHE LET HER GO.

17:26.934 --> 17:28.399
WORSE, SHE DROVE HER AWAY.

17:28.434 --> 17:30.766
YOU WERE SO
THRILLING TOGETHER.

17:34.968 --> 17:36.200

GOING TO DO

17:36.234 --> 17:38.133
TO GET HER BACK,
BETTE?

17:39.600 --> 17:41.767
I SENT HER FLOWERS.

17:41.801 --> 17:42.933

17:42.968 --> 17:44.767
OH, COME ON. YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

17:44.801 --> 17:46.600
WHAT IS SO WRONG
WITH FLOWERS?

17:46.634 --> 17:48.133
WELL, YOU'VE GOT TO BE
A LITTLE MORE ORIGINAL THAN THAT

17:48.167 --> 17:49.901
IF SHE'S AS SPECIAL
AS PHYLLIS SAYS.

17:51.067 --> 17:52.433
I'M GOING TO GO
AND COMMIT HARA-KIRI

17:52.466 --> 17:53.600
RIGHT NOW.

17:53.634 --> 17:55.299

TO SEE YOU, JOYCE.

I FIRST SUSPECTED

I MIGHT BE LESBIAN

18:12.868 --> 18:15.166
WHEN I WAS A SOPHOMORE
AT WELLESLEY.

18:15.199 --> 18:17.234
I FELL MADLY IN LOVE
WITH JANE HOWARD.

18:17.266 --> 18:18.667
WE BOTH LOVED--

18:18.701 --> 18:20.634
NO, NO, NO,
I MEAN YOUR PRESENT-DAY STORY.

18:20.667 --> 18:22.199
OH.I UNDERSTAND
YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND

18:22.234 --> 18:24.167
ARE GETTING A DIVORCE.

18:26.234 --> 18:27.600
YES.

18:27.634 --> 18:28.800
I ACTUALLY
SAW YOUR MOVIE

18:28.833 --> 18:30.501
BEFORE IT WON
SUNDANCE.

18:30.533 --> 18:31.968
I TRIED TO CONVINCE
THESE ASSHOLES

18:32.067 --> 18:33.067
TO PICK IT UP, BUT...

18:33.067 --> 18:35.067
OUR CLASSICS
DIVISION

18:35.067 --> 18:36.267
WAS A MESS.

18:36.299 --> 18:37.933
