WEBVTT

00:08.312 --> 00:10.314
Watch where you're --
Sorry.

00:10.358 --> 00:11.837
Gabriel: Dammit!

00:11.881 --> 00:13.535
Yeah.
Me, too.

00:36.601 --> 00:39.126
RJ:
I'm scared.

00:43.130 --> 00:44.392
But we're safe
up here.

00:44.435 --> 00:46.524
Gracie: You've seen
how many are coming.

00:46.568 --> 00:48.613
Lots more
than we have.

00:48.657 --> 00:51.529
You see these fingers?

00:51.573 --> 00:54.837
Not much
to look at, right?

00:54.880 --> 00:59.146
But together,they make a mighty weapon.

00:59.189 --> 01:01.539
That's who we are.

01:01.583 --> 01:03.150
Alexandria.

01:03.193 --> 01:04.542
Hilltop.

01:04.586 --> 01:06.109
Oceanside.

01:06.153 --> 01:08.546
People of the Kingdom.

01:08.590 --> 01:10.896
Is that enough?

01:10.940 --> 01:12.724
I'm not done yet.

01:12.768 --> 01:14.857
Who's that for?

01:16.424 --> 01:19.122
The others.

01:20.384 --> 01:22.212
The ones
that aren't here.

01:22.256 --> 01:24.171
Go, go, go!Carol: Come on!

01:35.399 --> 01:37.836
Those that might
find us help.

01:43.494 --> 01:46.106
Or come here and help.

01:53.983 --> 01:57.204
Together,
we will fight.

02:05.603 --> 02:08.432
And that's how
we will survive.

02:26.668 --> 02:29.410
Together.

02:38.897 --> 02:43.163
Together:
We are ready.

02:43.206 --> 02:46.078
Are you?

02:57.394 --> 03:02.921
We are the end of the world.

03:02.965 --> 03:08.449
This is the end of the world.

03:08.492 --> 03:11.278
Begin.

04:14.776 --> 04:16.734
Okay.

04:16.778 --> 04:19.302
Maybe we can
bend this back.

04:19.346 --> 04:20.564
Princess:
Pound that puppy.

04:20.608 --> 04:22.392
Hammer.
I have one in my bag.

04:22.436 --> 04:24.568
Ezekiel: I don't know about
this chain, though.

04:24.612 --> 04:26.266
Eugene, we could use
some of these

04:26.309 --> 04:29.051
problem-solving skills
over here.

04:30.052 --> 04:33.316
Hey.
It's not that bad.

04:33.360 --> 04:36.101
We'll be
back on the road soon.

04:37.233 --> 04:38.756
Don't bother.

04:38.800 --> 04:41.237
Come on, mate, we've --It's too late.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.674
I may have taken a shot
to the noggin,

04:43.718 --> 04:45.372
but I'm still capable

04:45.415 --> 04:46.460
of running calculatios
and estimates.

04:46.503 --> 04:47.809
And the ticks
it would take

04:47.852 --> 04:50.072
to execute necessary repairs
and vamoose

04:50.115 --> 04:51.987
is simply too great
a mountain to climb.

04:52.030 --> 04:53.728
We'll figure
something out.

04:53.771 --> 04:56.513
Unless it involves
slowing the passage of time,

04:56.557 --> 04:58.428
there's nothing else
to figure.

04:58.472 --> 05:00.561
Our rendezvous
was set in stone.

05:03.172 --> 05:06.480
And if we're not there,
Stephanie won't be, either.

05:09.744 --> 05:12.703
I'm truly sorry.

05:14.401 --> 05:15.880
After all we hoped,

05:15.924 --> 05:19.710
after all we went through
to hold on to said hope.

05:21.408 --> 05:22.539
I believe it's time

05:22.583 --> 05:25.847
we go eye to eye
with reality...

05:25.890 --> 05:28.415
and turn back
for home.

05:36.901 --> 05:39.121
We are not going back.

05:40.601 --> 05:43.952
We set out to do this,and we're gonna do this.

05:43.995 --> 05:47.216
In my own moment of doubt,
you did not waver,

05:47.259 --> 05:49.305
and I'm not aboutto let you do it now.

05:49.349 --> 05:52.656
This journey --
your journey --

05:52.700 --> 05:55.224
must be completed.

05:55.267 --> 05:58.401
Not just for you,but for all of us here

05:58.445 --> 06:00.751
and the ones
we left behind.

06:00.795 --> 06:04.407
We must try.

06:04.451 --> 06:06.627
That's what's gotten us
this far.

06:06.670 --> 06:09.325
On this journey
and in this life.

06:09.369 --> 06:12.415
And that's what
I want to remember.

06:12.459 --> 06:15.462
That we gave it
everything we had.

06:18.726 --> 06:20.380
Even if it means
I gotta carry you

06:20.423 --> 06:22.033
over my damn shoulderto do it.

06:28.562 --> 06:31.129
Come on.

06:39.094 --> 06:41.966
I want that, too.

06:42.010 --> 06:43.707
But it doesn't change

06:43.751 --> 06:46.318
that Stephanie will not stay
past sundown tomorrow.

06:46.362 --> 06:47.842
Princess:She say that to you?

06:47.885 --> 06:49.452
Then you don't know.

06:49.496 --> 06:50.932
I mean, I thoughtI'd never see people again,

06:50.975 --> 06:53.761
and, wow,look at me now.

06:53.804 --> 06:56.677
She's right.I am.

06:58.461 --> 07:00.724
We keep going,
and we get there.

07:00.768 --> 07:03.379
Tomorrow's problems
are for tomorrow.

07:08.993 --> 07:10.734
Carol:Helping some people?

07:10.778 --> 07:12.344
That's all she said?

07:12.388 --> 07:15.043
Daryl: Yeah.

07:16.305 --> 07:19.351
If they're like us,
I get it.

07:20.396 --> 07:22.354
I just wish
she would've told me.

07:22.398 --> 07:24.835
I'd've gone with her.

07:27.142 --> 07:29.318
Only wayshe would go anywhere

07:29.361 --> 07:31.276
is knowing
you were here.

07:31.320 --> 07:32.582
For Judith and RJ.

07:32.626 --> 07:34.454
Everyone.

07:34.497 --> 07:36.630
Just keep thinking
I'm never gonna see her again.

07:36.673 --> 07:38.327
Just like everyone else.

07:46.030 --> 07:48.642
I'm still here.

07:49.773 --> 07:51.862
Gabriel:
Our plan is the same.

07:51.906 --> 07:53.734
Lead the horde away,

07:53.777 --> 07:56.519
just not from Oceanside
as we had planned.

07:56.563 --> 07:58.434
Once the walkers
are clear,

07:58.478 --> 08:00.784
we evacuate
to Rendezvous Point B.

08:00.828 --> 08:03.526
Luke.
We ready?

08:03.570 --> 08:06.573
Yeah, yeah.
Uh, technically.

08:08.052 --> 08:09.227
Okay.

08:09.271 --> 08:11.926
So, these are
the final pieces

08:11.969 --> 08:14.972
that we need to connect
to the wagon.

08:15.016 --> 08:17.975
But in order for it to do
the pied piper thing

08:18.019 --> 08:19.803
that we need it to do
over the cliff,

08:19.847 --> 08:23.415
we gotta get from A to B,
and I gotta plug and plug,

08:23.459 --> 08:25.548
and thenwe should be good to go.

08:25.592 --> 08:28.377
That wagon is on the other side
of the horde.

08:28.420 --> 08:30.640
So...someone's gotta go through it?

08:30.684 --> 08:31.902
With skins in there?

08:31.946 --> 08:33.382
Gabriel:
Four groups.

08:33.425 --> 08:34.949
Two in each.

08:34.992 --> 08:36.516
One carries the cargo,
one protects.

08:36.559 --> 08:38.430
It's crucial
that all the equipment

08:38.474 --> 08:39.780
makes it to the wagon.

08:39.823 --> 08:41.825
Lydia: We can
make it through.

08:43.218 --> 08:44.785
I'll help.

08:46.090 --> 08:47.875
We're willing.

08:47.918 --> 08:50.138
But not if she goes.

08:51.661 --> 08:54.577
And we know she's earned trustwith you, but...

08:54.621 --> 08:55.970
Oceanside isn't ready.

08:56.013 --> 08:58.320
Not with this.That's fine.

08:58.363 --> 09:00.322
As it happens,
Lydia's role is in here.

09:02.280 --> 09:05.762
Look, we're not all gonna
make it through.

09:05.806 --> 09:08.199
But this
is the only way.

09:08.243 --> 09:10.985
If Daryl's going,
then so am I.

09:24.302 --> 09:25.869
Negan helped them
attack Hilltop.

09:25.913 --> 09:27.392
That couldn't have
happened --

09:27.436 --> 09:28.655
Dianne, I know.

09:28.698 --> 09:31.048
And I'm sorry
about that.

09:48.500 --> 09:51.155
Lydia: Need help?

09:53.941 --> 09:56.596
I've got it.

09:57.945 --> 10:00.600
Okay.

10:02.384 --> 10:04.995
If you're avoiding me,please stop.

10:06.518 --> 10:09.609
I don't hate you
for what you did.

10:13.961 --> 10:16.528
You should.

10:17.965 --> 10:20.010
Didn't fix anything.

10:20.054 --> 10:21.577
It did for me.

10:22.839 --> 10:25.102
A little, at least.

10:26.495 --> 10:29.890
I knowthat sounds awful, but...

10:29.933 --> 10:33.241
She was never really
my mother.

10:33.284 --> 10:36.374
Not in the way
that matters.

10:37.985 --> 10:40.552
So, thanks.

10:41.989 --> 10:46.558
And I-I -- I'd like itif we can still talk.

10:46.602 --> 10:48.125
About...

10:48.169 --> 10:49.736
whatever.

10:57.787 --> 10:59.528
Lydia...

10:59.571 --> 11:02.096
You need
to be yourself.

11:02.139 --> 11:04.794
You need
to find your own way.

11:08.798 --> 11:12.280
I'm not looking for another mom,you know?

11:12.323 --> 11:15.718
That's notwhat this has to be.

11:15.762 --> 11:19.983
It can be
something else.

11:20.027 --> 11:22.507
So can you.

11:34.781 --> 11:37.000
Got your back for you, dear?

11:38.610 --> 11:40.264
You know I got your backout there, too, right?

11:40.308 --> 11:41.788
Oh.
And the rest of me?

11:41.831 --> 11:43.790
Yeah,I'm good to get that, too.

11:49.230 --> 11:51.188
Hey.
You okay?

11:51.232 --> 11:54.017
I mean, going back into the herdafter everything...

11:54.061 --> 11:56.237
I'm fine.
You?

11:56.280 --> 11:58.152
Not at all.

11:58.195 --> 12:00.981
Hey.

12:01.024 --> 12:02.765
Why you clean?I ain't going.

12:02.809 --> 12:04.811
You've done this
more'n any of us.

12:04.854 --> 12:07.465
I am on the tip-topof every skins' kill list.

12:07.509 --> 12:09.772
Especially
fee fi fo asshole.

12:09.816 --> 12:11.600
So if the idea
is to get through

12:11.643 --> 12:14.124
without drawinga shitload of attention,

12:14.168 --> 12:15.822
then I am
the last person

12:15.865 --> 12:17.606
these people wantstanding next to them.

12:17.649 --> 12:19.521
That's a bunch
of bullshit.

12:19.564 --> 12:21.479
You wanna be
a part of this?

12:21.523 --> 12:23.786
You gotta put your ass
on the line.

12:23.830 --> 12:26.180
Just like
everybody else.

12:26.223 --> 12:29.400
Gabriel: It's time.

16:29.205 --> 16:30.728
Lydia: There.

16:30.772 --> 16:32.339
In the center.

16:32.382 --> 16:34.384
Brown plaid shirt.

16:34.428 --> 16:35.864
Just wound.

16:35.907 --> 16:38.301
Got it.

17:07.374 --> 17:10.116
Tighten the herd.

17:13.989 --> 17:16.078
Together.

17:16.122 --> 17:18.341
Together.

17:18.385 --> 17:21.083
Together.

17:24.521 --> 17:27.046
Whisperer: Together.

17:27.089 --> 17:28.525
Together.

17:28.569 --> 17:32.094
Right now.

17:51.026 --> 17:53.028
I can't find
any of them.

17:53.072 --> 17:56.031
Beta knows
they're in there.

17:57.989 --> 17:59.600
What do we do?

17:59.643 --> 18:01.341
Hey,
I've got one.

18:01.384 --> 18:03.125
Are you sure?
Uh...

18:03.169 --> 18:04.474
yeah,
I think so.

18:04.518 --> 18:05.823
Wait.We need to be certain.

18:05.867 --> 18:07.260
It might be oneof our own people --

18:30.239 --> 18:32.850
They're coming up.

18:40.031 --> 18:41.772
You all know
what to do.

18:41.816 --> 18:44.035
Dianne,
you get the first group.

18:44.079 --> 18:46.255
Children and wounded
come second.

18:46.299 --> 18:50.172
If Rosita argues,
just come and find me.

18:52.696 --> 18:56.265
You know
how this ends.

18:56.309 --> 18:57.788
I don't.

18:57.832 --> 19:00.008
Neither do you.

19:00.051 --> 19:01.401
Come on, kid.

19:01.444 --> 19:03.838
You being here
when the shitstorm hits

19:03.881 --> 19:06.362
ain't changing
what definitely is happening.

19:06.406 --> 19:07.668
I'm not leaving.

19:07.711 --> 19:09.887
They're never gonna
trust me, you.

19:09.931 --> 19:12.542
Doesn't matter
what we do now.

19:12.586 --> 19:15.023
You can just
slip out, down,

19:15.066 --> 19:17.504
and dance your way
through the dead.

19:17.547 --> 19:19.593
So can you.

19:21.595 --> 19:25.642
Like you said,
I ain't no hero.

19:25.686 --> 19:28.602
You could be.

19:28.645 --> 19:30.865
Well...

19:30.908 --> 19:33.433
I guess that's
what I'm doing now.

20:44.025 --> 20:46.680
What if
we're the only ones?

21:02.130 --> 21:05.133
Where's Carol,
where's Beatrice?

21:59.840 --> 22:03.234
Carol!
Take it! Take it!

23:13.827 --> 23:15.481
Need to start soon.

23:15.524 --> 23:17.091
They're not up yet,
but they will be.

23:17.134 --> 23:18.701
Daryl: Yeah,
right on it.

23:18.745 --> 23:19.876
But Luke's duct tapg
a bunch of wires

23:19.920 --> 23:21.356
to a tape deck so...

23:21.400 --> 23:24.272
My prayers are with you.Gonna need 'em.

23:29.451 --> 23:32.193
Go get Dog.

23:53.127 --> 23:56.173
The end...

23:56.217 --> 24:00.003

Daryl: Gabriel,
we lost the wagon.

27:19.768 --> 27:22.292
You got walkers
coming right back at you.

27:24.817 --> 27:26.819
They should've evacuatedby now.

27:26.862 --> 27:28.690
Then they're unprotected.

27:28.734 --> 27:30.561
We need to turn
that horde around.Magna: How?

27:30.605 --> 27:33.695
Look,
this ain't a good plan,

27:33.739 --> 27:35.305
but it's all I got.

27:35.349 --> 27:38.569
I say we go back in there,
and we hunt the skins.

27:38.613 --> 27:40.702
We take 'em out,
one by one.

27:40.746 --> 27:42.225
If we don't do this,

27:42.269 --> 27:44.488
all our people
are gonna die.Then what?

27:44.532 --> 27:46.360
How do we
lead them away?

27:46.403 --> 27:49.232
I-I will.

27:49.276 --> 27:50.756
No, we'll think of
another way.

27:50.799 --> 27:53.933
I know how.
She taught me.

27:53.976 --> 27:55.804
Hold on,
hold on, hold on.

27:55.848 --> 27:57.327
Let's saywe actually do this,

27:57.371 --> 27:58.764
and you lead them
to the cliff,

27:58.807 --> 28:00.766
there's no wagonto bring them over the edge.

28:00.809 --> 28:02.593
I mean,
it's suicide.

28:02.637 --> 28:04.770
It has to be me.
I can do it.

28:04.813 --> 28:07.250
We're gonna
deal with this later.

28:07.294 --> 28:10.471
Come on. We gotta go.
Right now.

28:20.046 --> 28:22.091
You all need to go.
Now.

28:23.658 --> 28:25.442
You're not coming.

28:25.486 --> 28:28.663
Someone needs to stop themfrom cutting the rope.

28:34.060 --> 28:36.627
Does Rosita know?

28:40.022 --> 28:43.852
Tell her, "Eres mi media naranja."

28:43.896 --> 28:45.898
Half orange?

28:47.682 --> 28:49.336
She'll know.

28:51.555 --> 28:53.775
Jude.
Come on.

28:53.819 --> 28:55.342
Go.

29:04.525 --> 29:06.962
The Lord's house
is a tower.

29:07.006 --> 29:12.011
The righteous enter
and are safe.

29:25.067 --> 29:26.852
Aah!

29:54.967 --> 29:57.534
It's okay.

30:00.363 --> 30:02.757
He's with me.

30:33.832 --> 30:35.877
Aah!

30:43.972 --> 30:45.756
Alpha.

30:58.769 --> 31:01.947
Negan:
Hey, shithead...

31:18.398 --> 31:20.487
For Alpha.

31:28.277 --> 31:32.281
Alpha:
In darkness, we are free.

31:32.325 --> 31:34.240
You bathe in blood.

31:34.283 --> 31:35.632
You are not broken!

31:35.676 --> 31:37.069
We are free.

31:37.112 --> 31:39.723
We love nothing.

31:39.767 --> 31:41.203
We are free.

31:41.247 --> 31:43.945
We fear nothing.

31:43.989 --> 31:45.860
We are free.

31:45.904 --> 31:49.298
We embrace our death.

31:49.342 --> 31:52.693
Now is the end of the world.

31:52.736 --> 31:56.175
We are the end of the world.

32:23.463 --> 32:24.768
Holy shit.

32:24.812 --> 32:27.075
You know
who that asshole was?

32:27.119 --> 32:31.036
Yeah. Nobody.

32:58.802 --> 33:00.500
Go.

33:04.547 --> 33:06.723
My choice.

33:06.767 --> 33:11.163
I finish it.

34:34.724 --> 34:37.336
I told you to go.

34:41.383 --> 34:44.169
You told me
to find my own way.

35:00.794 --> 35:03.579
Thank you.

36:52.166 --> 36:55.343
Hi.

37:30.030 --> 37:31.727
Is it...?

37:31.771 --> 37:33.903
Carol: It is.

37:33.947 --> 37:35.949
Thanks to her.

37:35.992 --> 37:37.298
And her.

37:37.342 --> 37:41.302
Luke: Thanks all around,
people.

37:41.346 --> 37:43.870
I can't believe
we pulled it off.

37:45.959 --> 37:49.092
You're still here.

37:49.136 --> 37:51.530
For now.

38:11.463 --> 38:13.726
You good?

38:16.206 --> 38:19.209
Yeah.

38:20.820 --> 38:22.256
It's over.

38:22.300 --> 38:23.562
Right?

38:23.605 --> 38:25.694
It is.

38:25.738 --> 38:28.001
You get
what you wanted?

38:28.044 --> 38:29.307
No.

38:29.350 --> 38:32.397
And I won't.

38:34.050 --> 38:36.226
Not really.

38:36.270 --> 38:39.012
Well,
you still got me.

38:40.666 --> 38:43.233
Yeah?

38:44.800 --> 38:47.412
Yeah.

39:01.600 --> 39:04.820
New Mexico's
still out there.

39:06.213 --> 39:07.867
Maybe someday.

39:09.347 --> 39:11.871
Yeah.

39:14.221 --> 39:17.137
We still have
things to do here.

41:20.565 --> 41:21.740
Did you guys
set up, like,

41:21.783 --> 41:22.915
a secret code
or something

41:22.958 --> 41:25.570
to let 'em know
you're here?

41:28.268 --> 41:29.748
Greetings!

41:29.791 --> 41:33.882
I am Eugene Porter!

41:35.928 --> 41:37.538
So, no code.

41:37.582 --> 41:40.106
Or, really lame code.

42:02.607 --> 42:05.348
We can stay
in one of the cars.

42:06.480 --> 42:07.960
Maybe in the morning...

42:08.003 --> 42:11.529
She's not here anymore.

42:13.661 --> 42:17.056
If she ever was...

42:20.189 --> 42:21.190
Hey.

42:22.191 --> 42:24.454
No regrets,
Eugene.

42:24.498 --> 42:27.327
That bolo can work its magicsome other time.

42:37.859 --> 42:40.558
We're not turning back.

42:44.649 --> 42:46.651
There are people
out here.

42:47.695 --> 42:49.828
Maybe not
in this very train yard

42:49.871 --> 42:54.223
or a hundred mile radius,
but they are.

42:54.267 --> 42:55.834
Stephanie is.

42:55.877 --> 42:59.751
So we'll keep trekking
until we find them.

43:01.056 --> 43:03.624
The very reason
we boldly voyaged

43:03.668 --> 43:05.844
was to make
what we built stronger

43:05.887 --> 43:07.889
by assimilating
with like-minded folks.

43:09.456 --> 43:12.328
So we'll keep
looking for them.

43:12.372 --> 43:14.592
And assimilate we shall.

43:24.123 --> 43:27.779
Damn, you're one
really horny dude.

43:36.004 --> 43:37.658
Man:
Weapons down!

43:37.702 --> 43:39.747
Hands in the air!
Now!

43:39.791 --> 43:41.967
Man #2:
Move, move, move!

43:42.010 --> 43:44.360
Man #3:
Hands up! Up!

43:44.404 --> 43:46.667
Freeze!
Hands in the air!

43:46.711 --> 43:49.583
Do it now!

43:49.627 --> 43:52.020
This is your last chance!

43:52.064 --> 43:55.589
Weapons down now!
