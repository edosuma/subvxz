00:02.160 --> 00:03.685
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

00:04.040 --> 00:05.246
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

00:05.520 --> 00:09.047
<i>I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.</i>

00:09.240 --> 00:10.730
<i>But my old approach wasn't enough.</i>

00:11.040 --> 00:12.724
<i>I had to become someone else.</i>

00:12.920 --> 00:15.526
<i>I had to become something else.</i>

00:15.720 --> 00:18.291
<i>I had to become the Green Arrow.</i>

00:18.920 --> 00:20.251
<i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

00:20.440 --> 00:22.044
<i>Those little yellow pills you swallowed,</i>

00:22.240 --> 00:24.402
they do a few interesting things,

00:24.600 --> 00:27.206
including making you cooperative.

00:27.400 --> 00:29.448
Thanks to the algae we engineered
from Star City bay,

00:29.680 --> 00:32.250
the air down here
is now perfectly breathable.

00:32.439 --> 00:35.444
Genesis is almost ready.
We're much too close to play games.

00:35.600 --> 00:37.443
- Do you remember what I promised you?
- A new beginning.

00:37.720 --> 00:39.449
And you will have it.

00:40.120 --> 00:42.566
Once we've brought this world to its end.

00:43.560 --> 00:44.891
Andy's working with Darhk
and has been the entire time.

00:45.080 --> 00:46.047
Andy!

00:46.240 --> 00:47.651
Your brother's way beyond reach,
Mr. Diggle.

00:47.880 --> 00:49.723
If I'd listened to you
instead of trusting my brother,

00:49.920 --> 00:51.126
Laurel would be alive right now.

00:51.400 --> 00:53.129
If Darhk wins, Laurel died for nothing.

00:53.320 --> 00:54.765
He feels unstoppable.

00:54.960 --> 00:56.724
- Because of his magic.
- It's too strong.

00:56.920 --> 00:58.490
You always find a way,

00:58.880 --> 01:01.121
<i>and you have to find a way now.</i>

01:03.640 --> 01:05.802
Now is not the time for panic.

01:06.080 --> 01:07.969
We let him rot in prison.

01:08.160 --> 01:12.131
Clearly, you overestimate
Damien Darhk's capacity for forgiveness,

01:12.320 --> 01:13.765
which is to say that he has any.

01:13.960 --> 01:15.644
Should Damien prove to be unreasonable,

01:15.840 --> 01:18.286
I have implemented contingencies.

01:19.400 --> 01:21.004
My buddies.

01:21.280 --> 01:22.930
Long time, no see.

01:23.120 --> 01:25.088
I brought my posse. Hope you don't mind.

01:25.520 --> 01:26.851
What happened to Ian and Judy?

01:27.080 --> 01:29.526
They come down with that nasty, little flu
that's been going around?

01:29.680 --> 01:32.160
Some were wary of this meeting
given that...

01:32.440 --> 01:34.363
You all abandoned me to my imprisonment?

01:35.000 --> 01:36.286
I visited.

01:36.480 --> 01:38.289
Someone should teach
this evil organization

01:38.480 --> 01:40.448
a lesson in helping their fellow man.

01:40.640 --> 01:42.688
I'm sure it's all
just a simple misunderstanding.

01:42.920 --> 01:46.163
After all, why would I rely solely
on the word of Malcolm Merlyn?

01:46.360 --> 01:49.045
- He can be so underhanded.
- Cute.

01:49.280 --> 01:51.123
And our illustrious council
has worked together

01:51.320 --> 01:52.651
for such a very long time.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.370
I'm glad that we still have your trust.

01:54.520 --> 01:59.048
Of course. I had a lot of time
to reflect while I was in prison,

01:59.720 --> 02:01.802
mostly about religion and bundt cake.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.287
But after much thought, I realized that...

02:04.520 --> 02:06.204
Oh! Almost forgot.

02:06.480 --> 02:09.848
Did my little incarceration
delay Genesis at all?

02:10.039 --> 02:11.371
Of course not.

02:11.560 --> 02:14.530
Genesis is much bigger
than just one person.

02:19.120 --> 02:20.849
Gold star for you.

02:21.800 --> 02:23.404
Where was I? Oh, that's right.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.369
My jailhouse epiphany.

02:25.560 --> 02:27.688
If I could escape prison
without your help,

02:27.880 --> 02:29.530
what do I need any of you for?

02:33.080 --> 02:37.005
Milo, you really have not been
paying attention, have you?

02:42.240 --> 02:44.607
Anyone else care to do something stupid?

02:45.080 --> 02:46.411
No takers?

02:46.920 --> 02:48.081
Pity.

02:48.920 --> 02:52.242
Ladies and gentlemen
and recently deceased,

02:52.920 --> 02:56.925
it is time to begin
the final phase of Genesis.

03:06.280 --> 03:07.247
Milo Armitage.

03:07.440 --> 03:10.410
SCPD found him
in an alley outside Ellendale,

03:10.600 --> 03:12.090
and across town,

03:13.240 --> 03:14.207
Phaedra Nixon.

03:14.400 --> 03:16.562
- Okay. So what am I missing?
- They were both HIVE.

03:16.800 --> 03:17.961
You probably don't recognize
Phaedra and Milo

03:18.200 --> 03:20.931
now that they're dead, or maybe you were
too busy running for your life, but...

03:21.120 --> 03:22.406
They were with Darhk
when he held us hostage.

03:22.600 --> 03:23.726
And now they're dead.

03:23.920 --> 03:26.605
What, so you think
crazy-pants Lonnie Machin's back in town?

03:26.800 --> 03:28.609
No. His grudge is against Darhk, not HIVE.

03:28.800 --> 03:29.801
You think Darhk is cleaning house?

03:30.040 --> 03:32.042
Well, HIVE didn't lift a finger
to break him out of Iron Heights.

03:32.240 --> 03:33.207
That was all Andy and Merlyn.

03:33.440 --> 03:36.125
Okay, well, if Darhk is settling scores,
then now might be the time to hit him.

03:36.400 --> 03:39.927
We have seen how powerful he is.
I can't risk losing anyone else.

03:40.120 --> 03:41.087
We can't just sit on our hands, Oliver.

03:41.320 --> 03:43.926
We're not just sitting on our hands,
but before we do anything,

03:44.160 --> 03:45.924
we need to know
that we can counteract his magic.

03:46.160 --> 03:47.969
Well, is that even possible?

03:48.320 --> 03:49.401
I think it might be.

03:50.160 --> 03:51.650
I was finally able to
get in touch with Constantine

03:51.880 --> 03:52.927
and he put me onto someone

03:53.120 --> 03:56.841
who he thinks may be able to teach me
how to defend against Darhk's magic.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.129
Okay. Well, I'm not just saying this
because I love Harry Potter,

04:00.320 --> 04:02.846
but why are we not all
taking those lessons?

04:03.000 --> 04:06.607
Well, it is easier said than done,
and apparently, quite dangerous.

04:08.480 --> 04:11.245
So, I have to go to Hub City
for a day or two.

04:11.840 --> 04:14.969
Okay. In that case,
can I take the weekend with Alex?

04:15.160 --> 04:17.685
Kind of wants to go away, clear our heads.

04:17.920 --> 04:20.127
That sounds like a good idea.
I think that...

04:20.360 --> 04:21.964
Actually, I think everyone should
take a little time.

04:22.760 --> 04:26.810
Lay low, but stay available, and
we will deal with Darhk when I get back.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.206
Okay.

04:34.360 --> 04:35.361
Let him in.

04:40.840 --> 04:41.841
Mind stepping out?

04:42.200 --> 04:44.362
"HEY. you. How you holding up?"

04:44.840 --> 04:47.889
You've, um, looked better.

04:48.880 --> 04:51.724
Considering I've spent two weeks
in a bomb-proof tungsten-encased bunker,

04:51.880 --> 04:52.881
I think I look pretty good.

04:54.680 --> 04:55.727
You hungry?

04:56.320 --> 04:58.527
Mmm. How long have those been there?

04:58.720 --> 05:00.722
That was lunch.
It might have even been today's.

05:00.960 --> 05:02.405
Yeah, I think I'll pass.

05:02.720 --> 05:05.564
Oliver is leaving tonight
on some Magical Mystery Tour.

05:05.800 --> 05:09.043
He wants me to stay put and do nothing
until he comes back.

05:09.320 --> 05:10.321
Magical Mystery Tour?

05:10.560 --> 05:12.164
Yeah, it's a long story.

05:12.360 --> 05:16.160
But the point of it is that he thinks
it's too dangerous for any of us

05:16.360 --> 05:19.330
to go after Darhk or Andy
until he gets the right magical know-how.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.563
- I can see you're thrilled about that.
- Mmm.

05:21.840 --> 05:23.080
If you think you have it bad,

05:23.320 --> 05:25.891
try remembering you're not the one
being held prisoner in a metal box.

05:26.080 --> 05:27.889
Look, sweetheart.

05:28.840 --> 05:30.205
We've talked about this.

05:30.400 --> 05:33.210
Andy has been inside of A.R.G.U.S.
He's been inside of our home.

05:34.160 --> 05:36.242
It's too dangerous for you
to be either place right now.

05:38.920 --> 05:41.366
I don't want you in either place, either.

05:44.760 --> 05:47.047
Oh, I got you. I got you.

05:48.840 --> 05:51.571
<i>- Let my agents see what they can find.
- Yeah.</i>

05:51.760 --> 05:53.922
<i>And, as much as you don't wanna hear it,</i>

05:54.600 --> 05:56.284
- Oliver has a point.
- Mmm.

05:56.840 --> 05:59.571
HIVE is too dangerous for you
to go off half-cocked, John.

05:59.920 --> 06:01.763
Well, it's always serious
when you call me "John."

06:02.040 --> 06:05.123
Well, John, why don't you
make yourself useful

06:05.280 --> 06:06.805
by grabbing some diapers while you're out.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.528
We're running low,
and I hate asking my people to get them.

06:09.760 --> 06:11.649
- You got it.
- Mmm-hmm.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.288
- Back in an hour?
- Or less.

06:17.040 --> 06:18.804
Good-bye, Daddy. Honey, say bye.

06:37.520 --> 06:40.603
- You've been living down here?
- Seemed to make the most sense.

06:40.800 --> 06:41.881
Where's all your stuff?

06:42.480 --> 06:44.482
It's just in storage.
You know me, I don't need much.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.126
Maybe like a plant?

06:46.320 --> 06:50.166
Like a fern or something.
They thrive in places like this.

06:50.840 --> 06:54.481
How could I forget? Come to see me off?

06:54.720 --> 06:55.846
You were pretty stingy on the details

06:56.040 --> 06:59.010
about this "magic tutor"
Constantine referred you to.

06:59.200 --> 07:00.326
That is, sort of, my MO.

07:00.520 --> 07:02.010
Don't talk to me like I'm other people.

07:04.400 --> 07:05.561
What has you so worried?

07:05.800 --> 07:08.804
Darhk's idol,
the type of magic that he's using,

07:09.000 --> 07:11.241
I've seen it take good people

07:12.720 --> 07:16.645
and turn them dark, soulless,
and almost inhuman.

07:16.960 --> 07:18.246
And you're afraid
that's gonna happen to you?

07:18.480 --> 07:20.164
There's an argument to be made
that I'm already there.

07:20.360 --> 07:22.044
- That's not funny.
- I am not joking.

07:23.680 --> 07:28.891
There is no length that I will not go to,
to avenge Laurel.

07:30.520 --> 07:32.329
To stop Darhk
from hurting anyone ever again.

07:34.320 --> 07:37.164
And I honestly don't know
where that path will lead.

07:37.360 --> 07:38.885
I'm coming with you.

07:40.040 --> 07:41.007
Felicity.

07:41.200 --> 07:42.531
Just because we're not together

07:42.760 --> 07:44.410
doesn't mean you have to do this alone.

07:44.600 --> 07:46.921
And, I've already chartered
the company jet. Mr. Dennis was furious.

07:47.160 --> 07:51.404
And I've booked us a room, rooms.
With points.

07:51.840 --> 07:53.604
Should I even try
and talk you out of this?

07:53.880 --> 07:56.929
No. You've met my mother.
Same DNA.

08:25.240 --> 08:26.241
Did you see anyone else here?

08:27.240 --> 08:30.483
Which way? Get out of here, now.

08:41.240 --> 08:42.730
What the hell?

08:44.600 --> 08:45.965
Sorry, man.

08:46.120 --> 08:48.771
But I'm not playing anymore! Whoo!

08:49.120 --> 08:53.603
You still got those quick reflexes, John.
Too bad they couldn't save your partner.

08:53.840 --> 08:55.285
Don't you dare say anything about her!

08:55.440 --> 08:57.488
Well, you got a gun. Make me!

09:29.600 --> 09:31.523
Hey, honey, it's a little tough for me
to talk right now.

09:31.800 --> 09:34.326
You'll wanna hear this,
satellite track just picked up Andy.

09:36.440 --> 09:39.330
Let me guess, he's somewhere south of Main
between Grammercy and Addison, right?

09:39.640 --> 09:40.641
How do you know that?

09:40.840 --> 09:42.490
Because I'm trading shots with him
right now.

09:42.680 --> 09:45.160
- Johnny.
- Yell at me later. Just send backup.

09:45.360 --> 09:47.169
He's at the Grammercy Power Plant.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.010
<i>How soon can your men get here?</i>

09:50.000 --> 09:51.001
Five minutes, ten tops.

09:51.160 --> 09:52.366
That's too long.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.001
<i>Johnny, you need to wait.</i>

09:54.160 --> 09:56.003
You have no tactical advantage in there.

09:56.160 --> 09:59.403
Well, I can't wait. If I do, he gets away.
I can't let that happen. Not again.

09:59.640 --> 10:00.971
Your judgment is compromised.

10:01.200 --> 10:04.363
Maybe it is.
But it doesn't mean I'm wrong. Get here!

10:06.520 --> 10:09.171
Johnny! Johnny!

10:13.880 --> 10:16.087
So, what exactly are we looking for?

10:16.320 --> 10:17.242
High roller room.

10:17.480 --> 10:20.370
When you said that you had found someone
to teach you magic, I was thinking, like,

10:20.560 --> 10:22.210
a mountain top or a hidden temple,

10:22.400 --> 10:25.324
not Hub City's
premiere underground casino.

10:26.160 --> 10:29.209
Well, with Constantine, I have learned
to expect the unexpected.

10:31.720 --> 10:32.767
I'm betting on Fortuna.

10:35.560 --> 10:39.087
Now, he was a little bit vague
with the specifics. He just said,

10:39.360 --> 10:42.921
"Pitch game, first base, mate,
see if you're worthy."

10:43.200 --> 10:44.201
Wow.

10:44.720 --> 10:46.085
Okay, pitch game, blackjack,

10:46.360 --> 10:48.408
uh, dealer using up to two decks.

10:48.720 --> 10:51.371
"First base,"
first seat on the dealer's left.

10:51.560 --> 10:53.562
I think we're in the right place.

10:53.720 --> 10:56.087
I'm not so sure that finding this guy
depends on gambling.

10:56.240 --> 10:57.890
It's not gambling when I play.

11:12.280 --> 11:13.441
Alex?

11:31.720 --> 11:34.610
Hello? Alex?

11:43.640 --> 11:44.766
Alex?

11:45.960 --> 11:49.965
Hey, morning. And here I thought
you were gonna sleep past breakfast.

11:51.640 --> 11:56.487
I almost did. I'm so foggy.

11:56.640 --> 12:00.611
Yeah, you were exhausted. You passed out
five minutes after we left the city.

12:00.800 --> 12:01.801
Oh.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.330
Guess I was really tired.

12:04.480 --> 12:07.689
See, it just proves how badly
you needed this trip. We both did.

12:08.640 --> 12:10.608
Now, you ready for some
famous eggs Benedict?

12:11.320 --> 12:13.049
You poached eggs?

12:13.280 --> 12:16.648
Hey, I'm not just a cutthroat
political operative. I contain multitudes.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.049
Mmm-hmm.
And you also wear a very mean apron.

12:20.320 --> 12:21.970
Well, you should see
what I have on underneath.

12:22.160 --> 12:23.844
Mmm.

12:28.440 --> 12:29.805
I forgot how good you were at this.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.684
Ah, like riding a bike.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.047
Rough beat.

12:34.320 --> 12:37.369
Indeed. I should probably head home soon
before they take my shoes.

12:37.520 --> 12:40.330
Well, you never know
when your luck's gonna change. Trust me.

12:42.040 --> 12:44.202
<i>That's so kind. Muchas gracias.</i>

12:44.640 --> 12:45.846
<i>De</i> nada.

12:47.240 --> 12:48.241
Oh, boom!

12:48.680 --> 12:52.810
Come to mama. I mean. What?

12:53.320 --> 12:56.005
I'm starting to think
that this guy's gonna be a no-show.

12:56.200 --> 12:57.201
Right.

12:57.360 --> 13:00.045
It's because he's not a guy, amor.

13:00.520 --> 13:02.045
Esrin Fortuna.

13:03.040 --> 13:05.725
Tell John Constantine
he still owes me money.

13:16.840 --> 13:18.842
Stay right where you are,
you son of a bitch!

13:19.560 --> 13:20.925
It's funny.

13:23.280 --> 13:24.725
I was gonna tell you the same thing.

13:29.200 --> 13:30.884
Bravo, John.

13:31.560 --> 13:33.130
You played the script out perfectly.

13:33.880 --> 13:35.211
What the hell are you talking about?

13:35.400 --> 13:37.528
Oh, don't worry about it.
I'll explain everything.

13:39.080 --> 13:40.241
After you wake up.

13:50.520 --> 13:52.204
Sorry, this place isn't as fancy

13:52.400 --> 13:54.402
as the cage you kept me in
for three months.

13:56.400 --> 13:57.606
Where the hell am I?

13:57.760 --> 14:00.650
You've got bigger worries.
Mr. Darhk is on his way.

14:01.240 --> 14:02.321
To do what?

14:02.560 --> 14:04.085
Well, he's not coming here
to play gin rummy.

14:05.280 --> 14:06.611
I'm supposed to prep you.

14:13.760 --> 14:17.446
Glad to see you're picking up
your psycho boss's old habits.

14:17.640 --> 14:20.610
I'm sorry, but is the man
that locked me up in a cage

14:20.760 --> 14:23.650
and beat me half to death
questioning my savior's orders?

14:23.920 --> 14:27.288
Damien Darhk is no one's savior!
He's a liar and a monster.

14:27.440 --> 14:29.283
The Romans said the same thing
about Jesus.

14:29.440 --> 14:32.444
Just do whatever you gotta do, man! Do it!

14:32.960 --> 14:34.485
Wow.

14:35.120 --> 14:36.804
There's that temper I remember.

14:36.960 --> 14:37.961
You know, it's a good thing

14:38.120 --> 14:39.963
that Sara's not gonna have to grow up
with it like I did.

14:40.120 --> 14:42.122
You keep my daughter's name
out of your mouth!

14:42.760 --> 14:46.321
How could you do this to everyone again
for a second time?

14:46.640 --> 14:49.530
Oh. Oh, I know what you're doing.

14:50.320 --> 14:53.961
You're referring
to my former wife and son.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.051
I left that life a long time ago, John.

14:59.480 --> 15:01.642
You can't even say their names.

15:01.840 --> 15:04.320
Carly. Andy, Jr.

15:05.360 --> 15:08.648
They were your family. They still are!

15:09.360 --> 15:13.649
My family is HIVE.

15:22.200 --> 15:25.409
Okay. So since Oliver
doesn't seem to wanna ask it, um...

15:25.640 --> 15:27.881
Why is an immortal shaman
playing blackjack

15:28.120 --> 15:30.168
in Hub City's premiere underground casino?

15:30.360 --> 15:32.249
Excuse me. Immortal?

15:32.520 --> 15:34.887
- You see any wrinkles on my face?
- And shaman?

15:35.160 --> 15:39.245
A shaman is someone who has influence
in the world of good and evil spirits.

15:40.040 --> 15:43.522
Blackjack is just a hobby. This way.

15:46.520 --> 15:49.251
You're planning on teaching me magic
in the back room of a casino?

15:50.360 --> 15:54.729
You want to learn the dark arts,
Mr. Queen? We cannot do that here.

16:07.040 --> 16:10.567
This is, by far, the coolest high roller
room I've ever seen.

16:10.720 --> 16:14.884
We've left the casino behind, amor.
And that plane of existence.

16:15.040 --> 16:18.123
I've been in a chamber like this before
on an island named Lian Yu.

16:18.360 --> 16:22.888
Yes, Lian Yu is a place of nexus.
Just like your home.

16:23.200 --> 16:24.247
Star City?

16:24.920 --> 16:28.083
There's a nexus chamber there as well.

16:28.280 --> 16:30.089
Wait, you didn't think
it was a coincidence

16:30.280 --> 16:31.930
that Damien Darhk chose that city?

16:32.120 --> 16:33.565
You know Darhk?

16:33.800 --> 16:36.406
I wouldn't be much of a shaman
if I didn't.

16:36.640 --> 16:39.723
A special brand of
nasty <i>loco</i> that one is.

16:40.360 --> 16:42.408
So, if you know Darhk,
why haven't you tried to end him?

16:42.640 --> 16:46.804
That's not the way of things. We immortals
tend to stay out of the affairs of men.

16:47.040 --> 16:49.122
Unless someone owes you money.

16:49.760 --> 16:51.762
Recognize this handsome gent?

16:52.880 --> 16:54.769
Darhk has a similar idol.

16:54.960 --> 16:56.928
- It gives him his power.
- Mmm-mmm.

16:57.480 --> 17:02.281
It only channels it.
Darhk's power comes from...

17:02.440 --> 17:07.731
Death. The more people he kills,
the more powerful he becomes.

17:08.440 --> 17:09.851
Not just a pretty face, this guy.

17:10.079 --> 17:12.242
Yeah, except Oliver's not gonna go
kill a bunch of people

17:12.440 --> 17:14.488
just to be on the same
level playing field as Darhk.

17:15.079 --> 17:17.685
All things have their opposite.

17:18.319 --> 17:22.962
Darhk draws his power from fear and death.

17:23.440 --> 17:25.646
Its opposite is light and hope.

17:25.839 --> 17:28.969
La luz <i>del</i> alma. "Light of the soul."

17:30.760 --> 17:34.128
If you can channel La luz <i>del</i> alma,

17:34.360 --> 17:37.682
you will be able to repel Darhk's magic.

17:39.120 --> 17:40.690
Then that is what I'm here to learn.

17:41.640 --> 17:44.166
I wish it were just that easy.

17:45.320 --> 17:50.008
If the darkness inside you
outweighs the light,

17:50.200 --> 17:55.127
instead of repelling Darhk's magic,
you'll end up fueling it.

17:56.360 --> 18:00.206
You will only make him more powerful.

18:07.360 --> 18:08.691
Are you getting a signal?

18:08.880 --> 18:12.202
Nope. It's one of the benefits
of being on vacation.

18:13.200 --> 18:15.009
Just wanted to call my brother.

18:15.200 --> 18:17.726
You okay?
Seem to be having trouble relaxing.

18:17.920 --> 18:19.570
Yeah, no, I'm...

18:20.000 --> 18:22.526
You're probably gonna think
it's stupid.

18:22.680 --> 18:24.921
Mmm, I can pretty much guarantee
that I won't.

18:27.840 --> 18:31.401
It's this place. it seems too perfect.

18:32.960 --> 18:36.043
Well, it sounds like it's been
way too long since you've left the city.

18:36.240 --> 18:37.605
Yeah, maybe.

18:41.200 --> 18:42.281
Do you hear that?

18:43.400 --> 18:45.243
Yeah, I think people call that "nature."

18:46.080 --> 18:47.411
No. That's...

18:49.440 --> 18:50.930
That's not it.

18:55.720 --> 18:58.405
I don't know,
maybe I'm just tired, but it...

18:59.120 --> 19:01.487
It sounds like
everything is on a loop right now.

19:04.280 --> 19:06.886
Does that sound crazy? That...
That's crazy.

19:07.120 --> 19:08.884
Only a little, yeah.

19:09.560 --> 19:12.086
Like, I think this is just
the last bit of you

19:12.240 --> 19:13.605
trying to fight this vacation.

19:14.560 --> 19:15.561
Yeah.

19:15.720 --> 19:18.087
Hey, let all that go.

19:19.600 --> 19:22.649
- Just be nappy. okay?
- Okay.

19:23.800 --> 19:24.926
I sure am.

19:26.280 --> 19:27.691
- Okay.
- All right.

19:30.120 --> 19:31.246
It's time.

19:33.520 --> 19:36.444
I know this feels personal, John.
But it isn't.

19:36.640 --> 19:38.449
What's happening
is just what has to happen.

19:49.160 --> 19:50.605
Ah!

20:02.360 --> 20:06.365
Do it. Do it for Laurel.

20:14.560 --> 20:16.528
She'd be so disappointed in you.

20:19.000 --> 20:23.562
The only reason why you're still breathing
is because one of us is still human.

20:32.880 --> 20:35.167
I'll hit you with a low dose
of Darhk's magic,

20:35.320 --> 20:36.890
and then we'll take it up from there.

20:37.320 --> 20:40.051
Don't I need an idol or a totem?

20:40.240 --> 20:45.041
The tattoo Constantine gave you
does many things. Are you ready?

20:45.680 --> 20:46.681
Yeah.

20:46.880 --> 20:52.603
Um, I'm sorry. I just thought that these
magic lessons would have, you know, more

20:54.000 --> 20:55.001
lessons.

20:55.160 --> 20:59.006
Magic is a manipulation
of primordial energies.

20:59.200 --> 21:01.362
Primordial as in pre-linguistic.

21:02.360 --> 21:04.249
You'll probably want to
take a few steps back, amor.

21:05.880 --> 21:07.041
Hmm? Mmm.

21:09.880 --> 21:15.250
Two sides of you. Darkness. Light.

21:16.400 --> 21:17.526
Focus on the light.

21:30.040 --> 21:33.044
Good. But that might be,
as they call, "beginner's luck."

21:33.240 --> 21:35.811
So, let's kick it up a notch or two, hmm?

21:46.760 --> 21:49.445
<i>The darkness and light are within you.</i>

21:50.160 --> 21:53.130
<i>In truth, you're only fighting yourself.</i>

21:54.280 --> 21:58.490
<i>The friends you've failed.
The people you've killed.</i>

21:59.240 --> 22:01.322
<i>They have no place in this.</i>

22:03.400 --> 22:07.689
<i>Don't give in. Cast aside your doubt.</i>

22:07.960 --> 22:11.248
<i>Resist your darkness.</i>

22:30.400 --> 22:31.811
- What happened?
- He's not ready.

22:32.040 --> 22:34.441
I'll get it. I'll get it.
Now, let's go again.

22:34.640 --> 22:36.722
I could give you
an infinite number of tries.

22:36.920 --> 22:38.126
It wouldn't change a thing.

22:38.320 --> 22:40.971
What? No, I can do this.

22:41.160 --> 22:45.165
I told you, if the darkness within you
is greater than the light,

22:45.400 --> 22:47.243
you will only make your enemy stronger.

22:48.280 --> 22:50.123
You've seen what's inside of you.

22:50.280 --> 22:51.486
Now, tell me,

22:52.080 --> 22:56.449
what could I possibly "teach" you
that would change what you saw?

22:58.000 --> 22:59.809
Wait, so that's it? It's over?

23:02.440 --> 23:03.851
There's nothing I can do for him.

23:15.320 --> 23:17.163
It's not even getting dark out.

23:17.360 --> 23:18.521
What's that?

23:18.760 --> 23:22.287
It's 8:00 and it's raining outside,
but it's still light out.

23:22.600 --> 23:24.443
Yeah, we're up north and...

23:26.960 --> 23:28.041
Seriously. What's gotten into you?

23:28.880 --> 23:31.724
You never even told me
where we were going.

23:33.120 --> 23:36.647
And, how can you not hear that?

23:38.000 --> 23:39.047
Thea, come on. We've been over this.

23:39.280 --> 23:42.045
Seriously, listen, there's three chirps,

23:42.880 --> 23:46.805
then a bark, then four chirps, and then
it just keeps repeating itself twice.

23:47.000 --> 23:50.004
Okay, I think what's happening here
is you're beyond stressed...

23:50.240 --> 23:53.847
No, okay. Alex, I am not stressed out.
Just listen.

23:55.360 --> 24:00.048
There's gonna be a bark right now.

24:07.080 --> 24:09.651
Since when did you start taking vitamins?

24:12.520 --> 24:15.171
Now you're worried about my vitamins?

24:15.400 --> 24:17.323
Where did you get those?

24:17.560 --> 24:20.689
Ruvé. She said I needed to stay healthy.

24:25.920 --> 24:27.046
Alex.

24:29.200 --> 24:30.281
Where are we?

24:33.280 --> 24:36.921
Is the reason that I don't
remember anything because you...

24:40.440 --> 24:41.885
Did you drug me?

24:42.120 --> 24:44.407
Thea, now you're talking crazy, okay?

24:44.600 --> 24:45.567
No, I can't...

24:45.760 --> 24:47.888
Where are you going? Thea?

24:51.920 --> 24:54.366
What the hell, Johnny?
I told you to stand down!

24:54.560 --> 24:56.961
I know. I know. But I couldn't...

24:57.440 --> 24:58.441
You could've been killed!

24:58.800 --> 25:00.404
I couldn't stand down,
not after what he did.

25:00.640 --> 25:02.085
Then you are going to make
an orphan of your daughter,

25:02.280 --> 25:05.250
because you are not seeing straight.
That's why tonight went south.

25:10.400 --> 25:12.482
- It's okay.
- Lyla, listen, I know, I...

25:12.880 --> 25:16.566
- I know I messed up.
- I know my head isn't on right,

25:17.640 --> 25:20.120
but he's my brother.

25:20.640 --> 25:23.291
And Laurel, she was like a sister.

25:24.400 --> 25:27.131
I know. And it's horrible.

25:27.960 --> 25:31.248
But, right now, Johnny,
you are not acting like the man I married.

25:31.440 --> 25:32.646
You're the man I divorced.

25:36.760 --> 25:37.807
Lyla, l...

25:38.000 --> 25:41.641
I just wanted to help him...
To bring my brother back.

25:41.800 --> 25:45.009
Then bring him to justice.
But do it the right way

25:48.320 --> 25:52.166
I will. I will.

25:58.680 --> 26:00.808
We'll find someone else
to teach you magic.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.651
Someone with more patience
and less smelly incense.

26:03.840 --> 26:07.526
She was right, you know?
It's not about the magic. It's about me.

26:08.360 --> 26:09.646
If she didn't see anything
worthy inside you,

26:09.800 --> 26:11.325
she never would have dealt with us.

26:11.840 --> 26:14.650
She didn't deal with us.
She dealt with you.

26:14.880 --> 26:17.121
She didn't reveal herself
until you offered her your chips.

26:17.800 --> 26:19.689
That has always been the way
with us, Felicity.

26:19.880 --> 26:21.962
You are the one who brings the light.

26:23.040 --> 26:28.809
You know? I told you that I've seen magic
that's turned good people dark.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.401
But all Fortuna did was
show me who I really am.

26:32.880 --> 26:34.405
Don't do this.

26:35.520 --> 26:38.251
Every time you face a setback,
you throw yourself a pity party.

26:38.480 --> 26:41.643
This is not a "pity party."
It's acceptance.

26:43.480 --> 26:46.370
You said it yourself. No matter what I do,

26:48.040 --> 26:51.089
I'm always gonna revert back to the person
I became on the island.

26:51.880 --> 26:53.928
You know, when I said that I was hurt.

26:55.480 --> 26:58.086
I was going through one of the most
painful experiences of my life.

26:58.320 --> 27:02.405
Oliver, you are not perfect.
None of us are.

27:05.080 --> 27:07.924
Good news is,
is that all of us can change.

27:14.520 --> 27:16.443
DARHKI Hmm.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.048
Poor widdle Andy Diggle.

27:19.880 --> 27:22.611
Did your big brother knock your noggin?

27:27.920 --> 27:30.969
Bravo. Your performance was pitch perfect.

27:31.480 --> 27:32.402
Thank you, sir.

27:32.640 --> 27:34.085
I assume the tracker's in place?

27:35.040 --> 27:36.565
We've already locked in on his location.

27:37.160 --> 27:40.926
Well, then I believe it's time
for one last family reunion.

27:46.400 --> 27:47.845
Oh, come on.

27:48.040 --> 27:49.371
You're a bigger baby than Sara.

27:50.320 --> 27:51.321
Ouch.

27:51.720 --> 27:53.609
Is there anything else you can tell me
about their lockup?

27:54.000 --> 27:56.241
Yeah, the place could've really used
some central heating.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.843
Well, it was strange.

28:01.040 --> 28:03.281
Torture just didn't seem
like the right play.

28:03.520 --> 28:04.851
Why not just kill me?

28:06.520 --> 28:07.521
What's that?

28:08.200 --> 28:09.201
Proximity alarm.

28:18.680 --> 28:20.887
Sweetheart, make sure
Sara's strapped in really tight.

28:34.240 --> 28:35.890
- How's Sara?
- She's okay.

28:39.040 --> 28:41.088
It's Director Michaels.
We have a code black.

29:02.920 --> 29:04.968
We have two more bogies.
How the hell did they find us?

29:05.160 --> 29:08.164
It's me. Andy let me go.
He probably tagged me with a tracker.

29:08.320 --> 29:10.163
You can blame yourself
after we get out of this.

29:10.400 --> 29:13.131
You mean, if we get out of this.
Where's your backup?

29:13.400 --> 29:16.131
HIVE has them engaged elsewhere.

29:16.520 --> 29:18.602
A.R.G.U.S. headquarters.
Where's your team?

29:18.800 --> 29:22.122
They're not answering.
So much for "stay available."

29:22.680 --> 29:24.364
We're on our own.

29:33.920 --> 29:37.447
This rig was designed
to withstand just about anything.

29:39.200 --> 29:40.770
Does that include magic?

29:50.640 --> 29:53.291
It's me he's after. I'll draw him out.

29:53.560 --> 29:57.121
No. If you were Darhk's objective,
he already had you.

29:59.600 --> 30:00.567
He wanted you to lead him to me.

30:00.720 --> 30:02.324
- What are you talking about?
- You need to get out of here now.

30:02.480 --> 30:03.845
- Lyla, I'm not leaving you.
- Johnny.

30:04.040 --> 30:05.405
I am not Amanda Waller.

30:05.640 --> 30:08.371
If they use you against me,
I will give them whatever they want.

30:09.560 --> 30:10.800
I need you both safe.

30:27.880 --> 30:29.928
Oh, that was a fun bit of business.

30:30.920 --> 30:32.001
Get him.

30:46.280 --> 30:47.281
Ah!

31:01.760 --> 31:05.287
You are a feisty one, Ms. Michaels.
You had your fun.

31:05.520 --> 31:07.522
It's time for me to have mine.

32:08.360 --> 32:11.125
Oh, it's been a while
since I've hit anybody with this thing.

32:11.360 --> 32:12.327
I didn't think you got my message.

32:12.520 --> 32:15.000
Sorry we're late.
Oliver's on Lyla and Darhk.

32:15.280 --> 32:17.521
- Baby Sara.
- Oh. Hi. Hi, little one.

32:17.760 --> 32:18.966
- Yeah. You got her?
- Yeah, yeah.

32:19.200 --> 32:20.645
_OkaY-_OkaY-

32:21.280 --> 32:22.361
All right.

32:23.960 --> 32:24.961
Okay.

32:31.480 --> 32:33.528
It's a small world, isn't it?

32:33.720 --> 32:36.451
Your brother-in-law
being my loyal servant.

32:36.680 --> 32:40.446
Thanksgiving at your home
is gonna be so interesting this year.

33:05.560 --> 33:09.007
You seem like a likable guy, Oliver.
I bet you've got a lot of friends.

33:09.240 --> 33:11.686
I'm going to enjoy
killing every last one of them.

33:13.240 --> 33:14.924
No. Never again.

33:37.080 --> 33:39.321
I bet you regret not pulling that trigger
the first time around.

33:42.320 --> 33:43.731
What are you gonna do, John?

33:51.520 --> 33:55.206
After Laurel, I left you alone to grieve.
I was being nice.

33:55.640 --> 33:57.802
You have no idea
how much I hate being nice.

34:23.480 --> 34:24.447
It isn't over.

34:24.639 --> 34:26.449
You haven't been paying attention, Andy.

34:26.639 --> 34:30.406
Darhk got out. I got out.
I'll get out again.

34:31.679 --> 34:35.161
That mobile safe-house you've got
looked really homey.

34:35.560 --> 34:37.402
Bet it gets cramped once Sara gets older.

34:39.120 --> 34:40.167
Shut up.

34:40.360 --> 34:41.929
She's gotta go to school eventually.

34:42.960 --> 34:46.203
And Lyla, well, you can't watch her 24/7.

34:46.400 --> 34:49.483
I said, "Shut your mouth," Andy.
Shut your damn mouth!

34:49.920 --> 34:54.447
You're the one who's obviously
not payin' attention. Because this is war.

34:54.639 --> 34:58.406
And women, children,
they're expendable in your war?

34:58.600 --> 35:00.648
Genesis is coming, John.

35:02.040 --> 35:04.611
Lyla and Sara won't be
the only women and children who die.

35:06.800 --> 35:12.807
Tell me, how does it feel knowing that
you had no problem pulling the trigger

35:13.040 --> 35:15.646
to protect a bunch of Afghanis
that you never knew,

35:16.120 --> 35:19.363
<i>but you don't have the guts
to do what's necessary,</i>

35:19.720 --> 35:21.324
to protect your own wife and child?

35:53.040 --> 35:54.405
How's Lyla?

35:56.080 --> 35:57.081
Um...

35:59.000 --> 36:00.047
She's fine.

36:00.280 --> 36:01.281
She's... Uh...

36:02.200 --> 36:04.567
She unconscious, but she's fine.

36:04.840 --> 36:09.448
Felicity's taking her and Sara back.
Darhk is... Darhk's in the wind.

36:12.880 --> 36:14.689
John, what happened?

36:16.880 --> 36:19.451
He was never gonna back off, Oliver.

36:23.320 --> 36:24.685
My family,

36:26.360 --> 36:28.249
they were never gonna be safe.

36:38.920 --> 36:40.410
- Hey.
- Hi.

36:42.920 --> 36:45.048
- Did you get in touch with Thea?
- Not yet.

36:47.200 --> 36:48.247
You Okay?

36:51.680 --> 36:54.001
Earlier, with Darhk, it worked.

36:54.640 --> 36:57.610
He tried to use his magic on me,
and I was able to repel it.

36:57.800 --> 36:58.881
That's incredible.

37:00.520 --> 37:01.885
How'd you do it?

37:06.640 --> 37:08.881
I heard your voice in my head.

37:10.240 --> 37:12.083
You were reminding me
of all the good things

37:12.280 --> 37:13.611
that I have in my life.

37:15.760 --> 37:17.649
I heard Thea, I heard John.

37:20.400 --> 37:21.686
I heard Laurel.

37:24.560 --> 37:27.643
Just telling me to keep fighting,
to never give up.

37:29.720 --> 37:31.688
Just telling me to have hope.

37:42.840 --> 37:43.921
Hey-

37:45.400 --> 37:49.041
- Sara? Where's Sara?
- No, no, no. She's fine. She's fine.

37:49.280 --> 37:51.248
Felicity took her to Donna. She's okay.

37:57.400 --> 37:58.561
But something's wrong.

38:06.840 --> 38:07.841
I, um...

38:09.720 --> 38:11.882
I had to put him down, Lyla.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.126
(And)'-

38:19.320 --> 38:21.641
I had to kill my baby brother.

38:22.600 --> 38:25.080
He wasn't a brother to you, Johnny.

38:26.760 --> 38:28.444
Not in the ways that really matter.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.570
What happened?

38:39.000 --> 38:40.889
He reached for my gun.

38:44.720 --> 38:46.324
I didn't have a choice.

38:58.200 --> 39:00.965
- Oh, no. No, no, no.
- What? What?

39:04.440 --> 39:08.684
It's gone. Darhk took it.

39:10.200 --> 39:11.201
Took what?

39:14.240 --> 39:15.526
Rubicon.

39:16.840 --> 39:18.763
I thought Rubicon was being stored
at A.R.G.U.S.

39:19.000 --> 39:22.129
It was,
until Shadowspire tried to steal it.

39:22.960 --> 39:25.850
After Waller's death, I had it moved
for security reasons.

39:26.040 --> 39:27.041
To where?

39:29.000 --> 39:30.001
It was under your skin?

39:30.200 --> 39:33.329
A subdermal implant. Darhk ripped it out.

39:33.520 --> 39:36.364
Lyla, you need to tell us what Rubicon is.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.128
A ballistic launch override protocol,

39:40.320 --> 39:42.402
designed to prevent any country,
even our own,

39:42.600 --> 39:44.090
from firing a nuclear missile.

39:44.280 --> 39:47.329
Something tells me
Darhk's plans aren't so benign.

39:51.480 --> 39:54.404
<i>With some work
and the right expertise,</i>

39:54.640 --> 39:56.244
<i>Rubicon could be corrupted.</i>

39:57.080 --> 39:59.367
Instead of controlling nukes
to prevent them from being launched...

39:59.560 --> 40:00.527
Oh, my God.

40:00.720 --> 40:02.529
Darhk would control
the world's nuclear stockpile.

40:02.720 --> 40:06.167
To what end? I don't mean to apply logic
to a bad guy's plot here,

40:06.360 --> 40:09.887
but Darhk destroys the world, then what?
He'd be ruler of nothing.

40:10.080 --> 40:14.642
Unless he wants to rebuild.
Andy told me that "Genesis" was coming.

40:14.840 --> 40:16.968
I don't think so. Phil Collins said
they'd never tour again.

40:17.160 --> 40:19.925
The Old Testament. The book of Genesis.

40:20.640 --> 40:22.847
God wanted to give the world a do-over
so he destroyed it.

40:23.040 --> 40:24.485
He destroyed it with a flood.

40:25.280 --> 40:26.930
Rubicon is Darhk's flood.

40:33.280 --> 40:35.681
<i>So, nuclear annihilation
is Darhk's flood,</i>

40:36.480 --> 40:38.642
what's he planning on building as his ark?

41:47.880 --> 41:48.881
English - SDH
