WEBVTT

00:19.227 --> 00:20.228
What are you doing?

00:21.104 --> 00:24.649
Oh, uh, the pink annoys my eyes,
so I'm making a few changes.

00:24.733 --> 00:26.484
-It's my room.
-It's our room.

00:27.152 --> 00:28.153
I'm moving in.

00:28.236 --> 00:29.696
What? No, you're not.

00:29.779 --> 00:31.031
But we kissed.

00:31.114 --> 00:32.073
Yeah, but…

00:32.157 --> 00:34.784
I spent all morning
moving my stuff from the bathroom.

00:37.287 --> 00:38.455
I'll help you put it back.

00:39.039 --> 00:42.167
It's just people don't usually
move in together after just one kiss.

00:44.377 --> 00:48.965
So, do you wanna keep the mural or no?

01:06.399 --> 01:07.984
<i>So, the clinic's a no go then?</i>

01:08.068 --> 01:09.319
Looks like it.

01:09.402 --> 01:11.821
And you're sure
they won't, like, do you a favour?

01:11.905 --> 01:14.574
Just leave it. It's not gonna happen.

01:14.657 --> 01:17.160
Well, at least you tried.
That's all you can ask.

01:18.536 --> 01:21.581
So, any men on the go?

01:21.664 --> 01:24.334
-Ew, Dad!
-Come on. I love a bit of gossip.

01:24.417 --> 01:26.169
Uh, Carrie's gonna break up with Kash.

01:26.252 --> 01:27.712
No, I'm not.

01:28.671 --> 01:29.756
I'm not, Martin.

01:30.465 --> 01:33.218
We just need to sit down
and talk about where we see this going,

01:33.301 --> 01:35.345
and our expectations, and what we need.

01:35.428 --> 01:37.972
Yeah. Sounds like
you're gonna break up with him.

01:38.932 --> 01:42.477
Look, I love Kash,
and I don't want to see him get hurt.

01:42.560 --> 01:46.523
But, I think, if you have a better time
with a man who's been dead for 400 years,

01:46.606 --> 01:47.774
it's a bit of a red flag.

01:47.857 --> 01:52.112
I know. I just don't know
how I'm gonna broach it with him.

01:53.696 --> 01:54.864
Don't ask me.

01:55.573 --> 01:56.574
If I'm not feeling it,

01:56.658 --> 01:59.619
I usually just send them a text
saying I don't have time to date anyone

01:59.702 --> 02:01.621
because I've discovered
an invisible treasure map

02:01.704 --> 02:03.790
on the back of
the Declaration of Independence.

02:03.873 --> 02:06.126
-You <i>National Treasure</i> them?
-I <i>National Treasure</i> them.

02:06.709 --> 02:07.710
Well, I'm not doing that.

02:07.794 --> 02:10.713
I'm just gonna be an adult and say,
"Hey, can we have a quick chat?"

02:12.882 --> 02:15.135
God, that's a bit dramatic, though,
isn't it?

02:24.602 --> 02:25.603
Kash, I--

02:25.687 --> 02:28.189
-Surprise!

02:28.273 --> 02:30.233
I'm throwing you a surprise party!

02:30.316 --> 02:31.568
Yay!

02:35.029 --> 02:37.198
-But why?
-'Cause I love you.

02:37.282 --> 02:39.200
-Whoo-hoo!
-Where's the party?

02:39.284 --> 02:40.410
Well, it's happening later.

02:40.493 --> 02:43.246
It's not really a surprise then, is it?
You just told her.

02:43.997 --> 02:46.166
Well, you'd expect the surprise to come

02:46.249 --> 02:48.376
at the same time as the party,
wouldn't you?

02:48.459 --> 02:50.545
So really, uh,
this is even more surprising.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.923
Well, I don't want to have a party.

02:54.507 --> 02:56.050
We're having a party?

02:56.134 --> 02:57.135
Mm-hmm.

03:01.306 --> 03:03.808
Well, I do have a slutty dress
I want to wear.

03:03.892 --> 03:05.560
-Yes!

03:07.979 --> 03:09.063
What's a party?

03:19.032 --> 03:20.033
What do you think?

03:24.412 --> 03:27.040
I think a serial killer did this.

03:27.957 --> 03:29.459
I love it.

03:30.793 --> 03:34.714
Aw, my favourite flowers.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.600
This is strange, right?

03:45.683 --> 03:47.310
Yes. It's not just you.

03:48.144 --> 03:51.189
Ooh, I'd better empty the recycling now
so that we have adequate space

03:51.272 --> 03:53.274
when it comes to clearing up
tomorrow morning.

03:53.358 --> 03:54.567
You've thought of everything.

03:59.572 --> 04:02.533
Isn't this amazing?

04:02.617 --> 04:04.202
You genuinely like it?

04:04.953 --> 04:06.663
Maybe we're made for each other.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.873
You both agree balloons are fun.

04:08.957 --> 04:11.376
I don't think that's the foundation
for a lifelong partnership.

04:16.631 --> 04:20.468
I can't have the talk with him
tonight though. It will ruin his party.

04:20.551 --> 04:23.930
It's your party. This is the perfect time.
He has to listen to you.

04:24.013 --> 04:27.558
You're right.
I'm doing it tonight.

04:27.642 --> 04:28.643
Start the chat.

04:29.978 --> 04:31.813
Get your head in the game, Carrie!

04:39.821 --> 04:41.990
-Have you tried the hummus?
-I love you.

04:42.073 --> 04:43.658
-Thank you.
-What is it?

04:43.741 --> 04:45.118
Chickpeas.

04:47.036 --> 04:48.413
-Oh.
-Whoa, whoa.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.874
-Sorry, sorry, sorry. Sorry.
-No. No, it's fine. It's just,

04:51.958 --> 04:53.376
public kissing is maybe a bit…

04:53.459 --> 04:55.795
-Yeah.
-Let's just take things slow.

05:04.178 --> 05:06.848
No, no.
I don't want a natty wine, young man.

05:06.931 --> 05:09.517
Is that my mum? Oh, for fuck's sake!

05:09.600 --> 05:10.893
-Let's go say hello.
-No!

05:11.394 --> 05:15.940
No, not right now.
Just you stay here and be normal.

05:30.747 --> 05:31.748
Why are you here?

05:31.831 --> 05:34.042
Your crisp selection
is absolutely baffling.

05:34.125 --> 05:37.712
Thai sweet chilli,
but no cheese and onion? It's unnatural.

05:37.795 --> 05:39.422
Why are you here?

05:39.505 --> 05:40.965
So, I can't go to a party now?

05:41.049 --> 05:42.091
Where's Andy and Ian?

05:42.175 --> 05:45.053
Don't even talk to me.
I had to leave that house.

05:45.136 --> 05:47.638
Andy is being a total brat.

05:47.722 --> 05:49.849
"My life's ruined this. I'm a freak that."

05:49.932 --> 05:52.268
And all I said to her
was that she needed to stop whingeing

05:52.352 --> 05:53.895
and pull herself up by the bootstraps.

05:53.978 --> 05:56.731
So I thought I'd focus on you now.

05:57.523 --> 05:59.692
-What do you mean?
-I'm gonna sort your life out.

05:59.776 --> 06:01.652
Is there anything you need help with?

06:02.653 --> 06:03.821
You're very single.

06:04.447 --> 06:05.907
No career prospects.

06:07.033 --> 06:08.368
The hair.

06:09.327 --> 06:11.371
I do not need any help. I'm fine.

06:11.996 --> 06:16.167
Hey, why don't you mingle?
Why don't you talk to this guy?

06:22.340 --> 06:24.008
-Gordon!
-Jennifer.

06:25.843 --> 06:27.220
It's not a costume party.

06:28.763 --> 06:31.641
I know. It's-It's the new me.

06:31.724 --> 06:32.767
I'm embracing my power.

06:32.850 --> 06:36.270
I'm the "come" guy.
So I should act like the "come" guy.

06:37.772 --> 06:38.815
Ladies.

06:39.607 --> 06:42.527
Okay. Well, Gordon, this is my mum.

06:42.610 --> 06:43.611
Mum, Gordon.

06:43.694 --> 06:44.737
Bye.

06:44.821 --> 06:45.822
Hello.

06:45.905 --> 06:47.740
Do not touch her!

06:49.242 --> 06:50.743
Right. We'll wait for him.

06:50.827 --> 06:53.037
I'll bring her over here
for a conversation.

06:53.704 --> 06:56.582
Get him talking
about how much he likes her.

06:56.666 --> 06:59.335
-Yeah, I know.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.879
Oi! Come on. Get it down ya! Down it!

07:01.963 --> 07:04.590
Down it! Down it! Down it! Down it!

07:04.674 --> 07:06.342
Down it! Down it!

07:08.719 --> 07:11.806
Okay, who wants to play strip poker?

07:14.350 --> 07:16.185
Just me. That's fine.

07:19.188 --> 07:21.274
-Put that away.
-Join in when you're ready.

07:30.074 --> 07:32.994
And you have to take
your whole trousers off every time?

07:33.077 --> 07:36.664
Yeah, I was looking into getting
a pair made with a flap in the back.

07:36.747 --> 07:38.583
-Jen.
-Thank God.

07:39.584 --> 07:40.877
You're a lifesaver.

07:42.253 --> 07:45.715
Did you see? Kash made macarons.
He remembered they're my favourite.

07:45.798 --> 07:46.966
I mean, they're bad.

07:47.049 --> 07:49.093
I wouldn't actually eat them, but…

07:49.177 --> 07:51.012
Carrie, focus!

07:51.095 --> 07:53.222
What is the one thing
you're supposed to be doing tonight?

07:53.306 --> 07:54.932
Balls.

07:55.016 --> 07:58.895
I swear I keep meaning to bring it up,
but I just keep getting sidetracked.

07:58.978 --> 08:00.938
And he's gone to all this effort.

08:01.022 --> 08:03.149
I know it's hard,
but you have to push through.

08:03.232 --> 08:04.317
Block everything else out,

08:04.400 --> 08:06.319
and just get the words out
as quick as you can.

08:17.830 --> 08:19.707
-Hey, can we have a chat?
-Of course.

08:19.790 --> 08:20.833
So…

08:22.001 --> 08:23.836
I feel like the adult in the relationship,

08:23.920 --> 08:27.173
and sometimes I feel more like your mum
than your girlfriend.

08:27.256 --> 08:29.383
And I need you to be more mature.

08:29.467 --> 08:30.801
I hear you.

08:30.885 --> 08:33.804
Is there something I can do
to prove to you that I'm listening?

08:37.683 --> 08:42.104
I suppose you could start looking
for a stable job.

08:42.188 --> 08:43.189
That would help.

08:43.272 --> 08:46.108
Oh, that's a good one.
I haven't tried that yet.

08:46.192 --> 08:47.401
Wait, no! Don't!

08:48.486 --> 08:49.695
Kash, can we…

08:58.329 --> 09:02.083
Mm-hmm. References? Yeah,
I can get them in before then. Definitely.

09:03.668 --> 09:06.337
And the interview will be at 1:00 p.m.
on a Wednesday?

09:06.420 --> 09:08.297
Yeah! Yeah, I can do that.

09:18.808 --> 09:22.144
So it's a devised theatre piece

09:22.228 --> 09:26.315
about three undocumented cleaners
with invisibility

09:27.108 --> 09:31.779
because they are invisible to society.

09:34.657 --> 09:35.658
No.

09:38.369 --> 09:41.038
She just keeps trying to talk to me.
It's exhausting.

09:41.122 --> 09:43.249
You could just talk to your girlfriend.

09:43.332 --> 09:46.961
No. No, it's the break-up chat.
I can feel it.

09:47.044 --> 09:49.964
-She's been very unhappy lately.
-How long have you been doing this?

09:50.047 --> 09:52.717
-I've been awake for 28 hours.
-You can't keep going forever, mate.

09:52.800 --> 09:55.094
No, I don't need to.
I'm gathering information.

09:55.177 --> 09:58.598
See, if I know why
she's breaking up with me, I can stop it.

09:58.681 --> 10:00.141
I can fix it.

10:00.224 --> 10:01.475
I'm just running out of energy.

10:01.559 --> 10:02.893
Have you tried these?

10:04.103 --> 10:05.688
It puts Red Bull to shame.

10:05.771 --> 10:09.317
It's technically classified
as an industrial lubricant in the EU.

10:09.400 --> 10:10.776
So you know it's good.

10:15.698 --> 10:16.824
Yeah?

10:25.625 --> 10:26.626
You got any more?

10:27.960 --> 10:30.838
So, what happens if you touch yourself?

10:30.921 --> 10:32.840
Nothing. And the ironic thing is,

10:32.923 --> 10:35.301
it actually takes me quite a while
to climax.

10:35.384 --> 10:37.053
Particularly with a new partner.

10:37.136 --> 10:38.137
Ooh.

10:39.388 --> 10:40.723
You're Jen's mum.

10:40.806 --> 10:42.600
I think she doesn't want me
to talk to you.

10:42.683 --> 10:46.312
Oh, of course she doesn't.
She may as well push me out the door.

10:46.937 --> 10:48.439
She's very confusing.

10:48.522 --> 10:51.734
Don't even start.
I can never tell what's going on with her.

10:51.817 --> 10:54.320
Oh, well, she's having a terrible time
right now.

10:54.403 --> 10:56.072
No, no. She told me she's fine.

10:56.155 --> 11:00.242
Uh, no. She wants to go to the clinic
so they can help her find her power.

11:00.326 --> 11:02.411
Because she feels left out without one.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.789
But it costs money,
and she doesn't have that.

11:04.872 --> 11:06.457
So they won't let her in.

11:08.709 --> 11:10.753
That seems like something you'd mention.

11:10.836 --> 11:13.172
She talks about it with her dad
all the time.

11:13.255 --> 11:14.965
Did you know he's dead?

11:15.925 --> 11:16.926
I'm aware.

11:19.345 --> 11:20.680
Excuse me.

11:28.562 --> 11:29.730
Have we met?

11:30.481 --> 11:31.482
I don't think so.

11:34.318 --> 11:35.319
After you.

11:46.497 --> 11:48.541
You've brought way too much, man.
You're gonna crash.

11:48.624 --> 11:51.168
Desperate times means desperate--
Whatever it is.

11:51.252 --> 11:54.004
Have you seen a girl?
She's about this tall.

11:54.088 --> 11:56.340
Irish, but not the scary kind.

11:56.841 --> 11:57.842
Jen.

11:58.968 --> 12:01.554
-What are you doing here?
-I've been texting. You haven't replied.

12:01.637 --> 12:02.930
Oh.

12:04.265 --> 12:06.559
Did you come all this way
just to check in on me?

12:06.642 --> 12:08.728
You usually respond straight away.
I assumed you were dead.

12:08.811 --> 12:10.020
No, no, I've just been busy.

12:10.104 --> 12:12.022
-With what?
-Hello.

12:12.606 --> 12:15.443
Who likes a party? Because this boy does.

12:15.526 --> 12:17.862
We don't need any pills, mate. We're good.

12:17.945 --> 12:20.197
No. No. I'm not a drugs-man.
I'm Jen's boyfriend.

12:21.449 --> 12:22.742
Boyfriend?

12:22.825 --> 12:23.951
-Yeah.
-No.

12:24.034 --> 12:27.079
Luke, why don't you go get yourself
a drink? Help yourself to anything.

12:30.666 --> 12:33.711
What about "taking things slow"
is introducing me as your girlfriend?

12:33.794 --> 12:36.046
-Aren't you?
-It's complicated.

12:36.130 --> 12:37.715
You say everything's complicated.

12:37.798 --> 12:40.217
Because it is!
The real world is complicated!

12:40.301 --> 12:44.680
I'm-I'm confused about a lot of things,
but you're the one thing that makes sense.

12:44.764 --> 12:47.224
Do you even hear what I'm saying?

12:47.308 --> 12:49.393
Maybe we should just give each other
some space.

12:49.477 --> 12:50.770
What?

12:50.853 --> 12:53.147
Maybe we should give each other
some space!

12:53.230 --> 12:55.649
Jen, someone's in your room.

13:02.531 --> 13:03.532
Can you read?

13:05.743 --> 13:06.744
What are you doing?

13:06.827 --> 13:09.288
-I'm hacking your computer.

13:09.371 --> 13:11.999
I've been taking IT classes.
I know what all the bits are for now.

13:12.082 --> 13:13.709
Stop it. Why would you do that?

13:13.793 --> 13:16.253
Well, it's the only way to know
what's going on in your life.

13:16.337 --> 13:17.838
Seeing as you won't tell me.

13:17.922 --> 13:20.925
Please be more cryptic
so I fully understand what's happening.

13:21.008 --> 13:25.179
You receive a lot of marketing emails
from a place called "The Clinic."

13:26.639 --> 13:29.391
-Why didn't you come to me about it?
-Because you're judgmental.

13:29.475 --> 13:31.519
Every time I talk to you,
you make me feel like shit.

13:31.602 --> 13:33.062
It only seems like that

13:33.145 --> 13:35.356
because a lot of the choices
you make are wrong.

13:35.439 --> 13:38.442
Oh, okay, so i-if I was just perfect,
this wouldn't be an issue?

13:38.526 --> 13:39.985
-Yes!
-You know, I used to be jealous

13:40.069 --> 13:41.195
that Andy was your favourite.

13:41.278 --> 13:42.655
But now, I think I dodged a bullet.

13:42.738 --> 13:45.825
You're not one to talk about favourites.

13:45.908 --> 13:47.201
What are you talking about?

13:47.284 --> 13:50.454
You're a monster if people think
you have a favourite child.

13:50.538 --> 13:53.666
But no one bats an eye
if you have a favourite parent.

13:53.749 --> 13:55.918
So I talk to Dad. Big deal.

13:56.001 --> 13:57.461
You'll talk to him but not me?

13:57.545 --> 14:01.048
Yeah, I do! Because he doesn't judge me
or try to fix me!

14:01.131 --> 14:02.591
He's just-- He's just there.

14:02.675 --> 14:05.010
He's not there! I am!

14:09.932 --> 14:11.100
I'm right here!

14:17.106 --> 14:18.232
Yeah, I know.

14:24.196 --> 14:25.781
I shouldn't have brought him up.

14:26.407 --> 14:27.783
It's fine.

14:28.284 --> 14:31.912
-Do you want me to leave?
-No, no. No, you can stay. It…

14:33.455 --> 14:35.624
Although, I think we've run out of crisps.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.334
What? It's only 11:00.

14:37.418 --> 14:40.170
Jesus Christ.
Who did the Ocado, Bobby Sands?

14:48.345 --> 14:51.932
Better go down there before
someone takes the last sweet chilli.

15:07.406 --> 15:10.451
-Are you okay?
-No, I'm fine. Let's dance.

15:14.496 --> 15:17.166
Kash, while I have you,
we should probably--

15:17.249 --> 15:19.001
Talk? Okay.

15:19.084 --> 15:21.795
Cheers, Carrie. Great party.

15:23.464 --> 15:25.215
Actually, it's fine. Never mind.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.019
We have a problem.

15:39.855 --> 15:41.106
Okay, I still don't get it.

15:41.190 --> 15:43.901
He's turning back time every time
I try and have the chat with him.

15:43.984 --> 15:46.820
-That's not good.
-Not good? It's effed up!

15:46.904 --> 15:48.948
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, relax.

15:49.031 --> 15:51.158
He knows exactly what I'm gonna do,

15:51.241 --> 15:53.702
so he knows exactly how to throw me off.

15:54.286 --> 15:56.205
I can't believe he'd do this to me
during my party.

15:56.288 --> 15:58.707
Carrie. The party's part of it.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.626
Oh, my God.

16:02.211 --> 16:03.629
Do you think he's been avoiding you?

16:03.712 --> 16:06.131
Of course he has.
I've been chasing him all evening.

16:06.215 --> 16:08.050
He's only making it worse.

16:08.133 --> 16:11.011
I swear to God, I've never met anyone
so stupid with this stuff.

16:11.095 --> 16:12.096
He's hopeless.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.768
What if he's been doing this
our whole relationship?

16:17.851 --> 16:19.603
I guess you don't need
to have the talk anymore.

16:19.687 --> 16:22.398
How am I ever gonna trust him again?
How am I even gonna break up with him?

16:22.481 --> 16:24.650
It doesn't matter what I do.
He'll just keep turning back time.

16:24.733 --> 16:26.151
Maybe I already have.

16:26.235 --> 16:27.903
He's bound to run out of energy
at some point.

16:27.987 --> 16:31.740
Usually he just carb loads,
but I haven't seen him eat much.

16:33.242 --> 16:34.326
Is he taking drugs?

16:35.160 --> 16:37.496
Oh, God. It's meth, isn't it?

16:42.418 --> 16:44.211
Hey, fuck off. My house.

16:45.462 --> 16:46.755
Bingo.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.549
I knew they were up to something.

16:57.433 --> 16:59.893
Hey, um, Carrie said she wants to have
a quick chat with you.

16:59.977 --> 17:01.061
Mm-hmm.

17:11.822 --> 17:12.823
Poor fucker.

17:13.407 --> 17:14.408
There you are.

17:15.367 --> 17:16.744
I made you a cocktail.

17:16.827 --> 17:17.953
Ooh.

17:21.623 --> 17:22.624
It's just wine.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.418
Yeah, but it's got
a little umbrella in it.

17:24.501 --> 17:25.836
Yeah, it's good.

17:25.919 --> 17:26.920
Mmm.

17:27.546 --> 17:32.468
So, I was thinking, how would you like
to go for a little flight?

17:32.551 --> 17:35.345
I could take off right now, if you like.
It's a beautiful night.

17:35.429 --> 17:36.889
Really? Me?

17:38.807 --> 17:41.101
There's not a hotter,
taller woman standing behind me, is there?

17:41.185 --> 17:42.394
Because that has happened before.

17:42.478 --> 17:46.356
No, it's just you and me.

17:50.402 --> 17:52.488
Um, do you wanna go outside then?

17:53.614 --> 17:54.615
Yeah.

18:03.665 --> 18:04.666
They're gone.

18:08.045 --> 18:09.213
I know.

18:09.296 --> 18:10.881
Randall, come on. Make me a new can.

18:14.843 --> 18:16.345
Kash, I'm…

18:18.180 --> 18:19.973
I don't wanna do this.

18:20.057 --> 18:21.058
So don't.

18:21.809 --> 18:23.936
Just don't. Please. I can fix it.

18:24.728 --> 18:26.897
-Not this time.
-Randall, come on! Hurry up!

18:26.980 --> 18:29.525
I'm not a vending machine, mate.
It's gonna take a while.

18:31.610 --> 18:32.903
Don't say it.

18:35.030 --> 18:36.448
I think we should break up.

18:40.702 --> 18:41.745
I think we should break up.

18:45.040 --> 18:46.125
I think we should break--

18:47.876 --> 18:49.086
…break up.

18:53.298 --> 18:54.842
I think we should break up.

19:02.766 --> 19:05.477
You need sleep. Let's get you to bed.

19:10.524 --> 19:11.525
I'm sorry.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.743
Are you sure
your boyfriend's not gonna mind?

19:22.369 --> 19:25.038
Oh. Oh, So that's what it is.
You're jealous.

19:27.541 --> 19:29.793
That you have a boyfriend? Maybe.

19:29.877 --> 19:31.920
Of that boyfriend in particular, no.

19:32.796 --> 19:33.797
Why not?

19:33.881 --> 19:37.718
Come on, really? Just seems like
a bit of a weirdo.

19:38.969 --> 19:39.970
Come on.

19:40.846 --> 19:41.972
He's not a weirdo.

19:43.015 --> 19:46.101
He's a bit different,
but that doesn't mean he's not good.

19:49.062 --> 19:50.063
Sure.

19:50.856 --> 19:52.357
Look, you don't know him.

19:52.441 --> 19:54.818
He's kind, and he's funny.

19:54.902 --> 19:57.988
Not intentionally, most of the time,
but he makes me laugh.

19:58.864 --> 20:01.116
And he always
has the dumbest questions.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.618
But it's like there's a logic to them.

20:04.995 --> 20:06.622
And he actually wants to be with me.

20:08.749 --> 20:10.751
You'd think that would be
the bare minimum, but…

20:13.420 --> 20:14.713
That's it, really, isn't it?

20:15.631 --> 20:17.382
He likes me. I like him.

20:18.926 --> 20:20.177
Not that complicated.

20:21.470 --> 20:23.180
You could aim a lot higher, Jen.

20:26.934 --> 20:29.519
Nah, I'm good.

20:31.438 --> 20:32.439
Jen.

20:33.815 --> 20:34.816
Jen.

20:36.193 --> 20:37.194
Where are you going?

20:39.112 --> 20:40.405
Hey!

20:41.448 --> 20:42.449
Whatever.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.711
I swear, this has never happened before.

20:54.795 --> 20:56.964
-Okay.

20:59.383 --> 21:00.550
Jizzlord?

21:01.843 --> 21:02.844
Jizzlord!

21:04.846 --> 21:05.847
Jizzlord!

21:11.770 --> 21:12.980
Have you seen Jizzlord?

21:13.063 --> 21:14.064
No.

21:16.066 --> 21:17.067
Why?

21:17.150 --> 21:20.404
Jizzlord? Jizzlord?

21:25.575 --> 21:26.618
Jizzlord!

21:32.082 --> 21:33.083
Jizzlord!

21:36.712 --> 21:37.963
Oh, no.

21:38.964 --> 21:41.383
No, no, no, no, no!

21:46.346 --> 21:47.431
I'm sorry.

21:47.514 --> 21:49.850
-I was being stupid earlier.

21:49.933 --> 21:52.269
Look, I act like I'm smarter than you,
but I'm not.

21:52.352 --> 21:53.770
Not with important things.

21:55.772 --> 21:56.773
Fuck.

22:00.193 --> 22:01.778
Can you hear me?

22:01.862 --> 22:04.072
I don't want space! I want you to be here.

22:05.365 --> 22:08.452
I don't know what I'm doing,
but I know I don't want you to go.

22:11.038 --> 22:12.706
I want you to be my boyfriend!

22:14.291 --> 22:16.460
You want a bin to be your boyfriend?

22:18.378 --> 22:20.964
That's a bit of a slap in the face.
I'm not gonna lie.

22:47.199 --> 22:50.452
Whoop, whoop.
Hey-o. Whoop, whoop.

22:50.535 --> 22:52.287
Who wants to do body shots?

22:52.371 --> 22:54.873
Gordon, it's 2:00 a.m. Go home.

22:54.956 --> 22:56.583
We're young. We could go clubbing.

22:56.666 --> 22:59.586
God, who am I kidding? This isn't me.

22:59.669 --> 23:00.670
I hate this.

23:00.754 --> 23:03.340
-Do you want a cup of tea?
-Yes, please.

23:06.885 --> 23:11.765
-Jesus, you'll catch your death.
-Mum, I want you to meet my boyfriend.

23:12.391 --> 23:15.143
What?

23:17.729 --> 23:21.191
Hello again. What was your name?

23:21.274 --> 23:22.317
-It doesn't matter.
-Jizzlord.

23:22.401 --> 23:23.860
I'm sorry, it's what lord?

23:23.944 --> 23:25.695
Uh, it's J--

23:29.116 --> 23:31.618
Hey. This clinic.

23:33.245 --> 23:35.247
I hear you don't have enough money for it.

23:35.330 --> 23:36.456
Yeah.

23:39.835 --> 23:41.002
I'll pay for it.

23:41.086 --> 23:42.254
Really?

23:42.337 --> 23:43.755
Yeah.

23:43.839 --> 23:45.674
If it'll make you happy.

23:46.842 --> 23:48.093
How much is it?

23:48.885 --> 23:49.886
Twelve grand.

23:49.970 --> 23:51.680
Fucking hell! What?

23:51.763 --> 23:55.142
Jesus Christ. Lead with the price.
What did you let me do that for?

23:55.225 --> 23:57.144
-What, you don't have it?
-Of course I don't have it!

23:57.227 --> 23:58.270
I'm not a Saudi prince.

24:01.440 --> 24:02.524
I have it.

24:05.068 --> 24:08.989
I've been supplementing my income

24:09.072 --> 24:12.075
by providing a service
to unfulfilled women.

24:12.159 --> 24:15.036
And that made you £12,000?

24:15.120 --> 24:17.706
No, it's just pocket change. Straight
women just paid off my student loan.

24:17.789 --> 24:21.042
Gordon. I can't take your gigolo money.
You earned it.

24:21.126 --> 24:24.713
Really, i-it feels wrong.
I want you to have it.

24:29.301 --> 24:30.552
I'm going to the clinic.

24:30.635 --> 24:32.345
You're going to the clinic.

24:34.556 --> 24:35.974
-Oh.

24:37.225 --> 24:39.895
Okay. Well done. Very good.

24:41.229 --> 24:43.398
-Oh, no, no, no.

24:44.566 --> 24:45.567
Yeah, we have met.

24:46.651 --> 24:47.652
Yep.

24:53.158 --> 24:54.284
Morning.

24:54.367 --> 24:55.619
Morning.

24:57.120 --> 24:59.706
I've never seen you smile
for this long before.

24:59.789 --> 25:02.751
Kinda hurts. I don't know
how people do it all the time.

25:02.834 --> 25:03.919
I like it.

25:11.301 --> 25:12.469
Uh, where are you going?

25:12.552 --> 25:14.554
Did I do something wrong?
I'm sorry. Don't leave me.

25:14.638 --> 25:17.766
I'm just going to the shop.
I really fancy some pancakes.

25:17.849 --> 25:19.601
-I'll go.
-No, no, no, don't. I better go.

25:19.684 --> 25:22.771
-Just flour, milk, eggs, sugar, right?
-No, you for--

25:23.605 --> 25:26.107
Actually, yeah. Yeah, that's right.

25:27.400 --> 25:28.860
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

26:12.195 --> 26:14.489
-That's £5.65, please.
-Mummy, look!

26:14.573 --> 26:18.410
-Just give me a minute.
-But, Mummy! That man looks like Daddy.
