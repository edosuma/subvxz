WEBVTT

00:06.407 --> 00:08.442
- Previously, on "Colony"...

00:09.243 --> 00:09.777
- This is amazing.
Does it work?

00:10.744 --> 00:11.412
- Not unless I can find
a high-quality lens.

00:12.113 --> 00:13.114
- I think I can get one for you.

00:14.148 --> 00:15.116
- Our cause needs
all sorts of people, Katie.

00:16.117 --> 00:17.017
It needs soldiers
like Broussard

00:18.419 --> 00:19.053
who can pull the trigger,
and it needs people like you.

00:20.221 --> 00:22.690
- What purpose do I serve other
than spying on my husband?

00:22.790 --> 00:24.125
- Whatever
you're going through,

00:24.225 --> 00:25.659
we're going through together.

00:25.759 --> 00:27.395
You can tell me anything.

00:27.495 --> 00:29.430
He was a government hit man
before he sold out

00:29.530 --> 00:30.664
to a military contractor.

00:30.764 --> 00:32.400
Now he's a stone-cold killer.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.502
Anything you can remember
could help.

00:36.104 --> 00:37.605
- Yeah?
- He's coming for you.

00:40.308 --> 00:43.144
- Hey, seen your neighbor today?
- Nope.

00:43.244 --> 00:46.680
- What if you were passing
information to the Resistance

00:46.780 --> 00:48.349
without even knowing it,

00:48.449 --> 00:50.184
being the trusting husband
that you are?

00:50.284 --> 00:52.286
- I sent Carlos to the Factory.

00:52.386 --> 00:54.755
- Lots of decisions will always
be made above our heads.

00:54.855 --> 00:56.590
That's just how it is.

01:14.908 --> 01:18.546
[low background chatter]

- [coughing]

02:12.566 --> 02:15.669
[continues coughing]

02:15.769 --> 02:18.706
Please! It's just
something in my throat!

02:18.806 --> 02:21.275
[coughing]

02:21.375 --> 02:23.177
There's just something
in my throat!

02:23.277 --> 02:25.746
[sobs]
I'm not sick!

02:25.846 --> 02:29.283
I'm not sick!
[sobs] I'm not sick!

02:36.690 --> 02:39.693
[buzzer blares twice]

02:45.733 --> 02:47.535
- It's not gonna
get any closer

02:47.635 --> 02:49.870
just 'cause
you keep staring at it.

02:49.970 --> 02:51.672
- What does it matter to you?

02:51.772 --> 02:53.707
- Because every time
I see your sad-ass face,

02:53.807 --> 02:56.910
I remember where I am.
It's depressing.

03:03.451 --> 03:07.288
[dramatic music]

03:09.790 --> 03:12.760
[dramatic music]

03:12.860 --> 03:17.631
*

03:32.713 --> 03:35.416
- What?

03:35.516 --> 03:38.252
- Nothing.

03:38.352 --> 03:41.855
- Been staring at me
all morning.

03:41.955 --> 03:44.292
- Can't a man enjoy the sight
of his beautiful wife

03:44.392 --> 03:47.395
without getting
the third degree?

03:48.562 --> 03:50.931
- Bram,
what are you reading?

03:51.031 --> 03:53.901
- Some stuff for school.

03:57.605 --> 03:59.773
- Bram.

03:59.873 --> 04:03.311
Gracie.

04:03.411 --> 04:06.580
Your mom and I need
to tell you something.

04:10.484 --> 04:13.954
Charlie's okay.

04:27.501 --> 04:29.870
- Where is this?

04:29.970 --> 04:32.440
- The government found him in
the Santa Monica bloc.

04:32.540 --> 04:34.842
- Who's he living with?

04:34.942 --> 04:36.577
- We don't know.

04:36.677 --> 04:39.279
- Is he coming home?

04:39.380 --> 04:41.549
- That's the plan.

04:41.649 --> 04:45.819
That's the whole reason I went
to work for the government.

04:45.919 --> 04:48.589
So we could get him back home.

04:49.690 --> 04:53.327
- When are we gonna see him?

04:53.427 --> 04:55.463
- I don't know.
- What do you know?

04:55.563 --> 04:59.333
- I know I'm making progress.

05:00.701 --> 05:03.337
- I'm gonna be out late tonight.

05:03.437 --> 05:06.640
- Why? Where are you going?

05:08.676 --> 05:11.479
- [sighs]

05:11.579 --> 05:12.846
- I miss him.

05:13.981 --> 05:16.384
- We all do, Bear.

05:16.484 --> 05:19.387
[somber music]

05:19.487 --> 05:24.858
*

05:24.958 --> 05:27.327
- Hey.

05:27.428 --> 05:29.062
What in the hell was that?

05:29.162 --> 05:30.898
- They needed to know.

05:30.998 --> 05:32.500
- You don't think that should
have been a discussion?

05:32.600 --> 05:34.735
- There's nothing to discuss.

05:34.835 --> 05:38.639
There shouldn't be any secrets
in our house.

05:50.117 --> 05:52.953
- Helena.
What a pleasant surprise.

05:53.053 --> 05:55.489
- Hello, Alan.

05:55.589 --> 05:58.626
- Always good to see you,
of course.

05:58.726 --> 06:02.062
Our meetings are just usually
more...scheduled.

06:02.162 --> 06:04.932
- Well,
I wanted to let you know

06:05.032 --> 06:07.968
that the Chief Minister
of the Pacific Coast

06:08.068 --> 06:10.904
is coming to our Colony for
the anniversary of the Arrival.

06:11.004 --> 06:12.473
- Here? Why?

06:12.573 --> 06:15.576
Is there going to be
some kind of celebration?

06:15.676 --> 06:18.979
- Not exactly, no.

06:19.079 --> 06:21.715
More like a performance review.

06:21.815 --> 06:24.418
- Great. I welcome that.

06:24.518 --> 06:27.588
I think things are going
very well here as of late.

06:27.688 --> 06:29.623
We're meeting
all of our worker quotas.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.124
Since the Geronimo trial,

06:31.224 --> 06:33.126
we've had no significant
insurrection.

06:33.226 --> 06:36.464
- Except, of course,
for your abduction attempt.

06:36.564 --> 06:38.031
- A complete outlier

06:38.131 --> 06:41.001
which has been fully handled
by my counter-insurgency team.

06:41.101 --> 06:43.704
- I'm not the one
you need to convince.

06:43.804 --> 06:45.439
- Of course.

06:45.539 --> 06:48.876
I just want you to know
that I stand behind my work.

06:51.078 --> 06:52.846
- Tell me, Alan,

06:52.946 --> 06:55.516
do you think that anyone
is afraid to do anything

06:55.616 --> 06:57.017
in your bloc?

06:59.553 --> 07:02.155
- They gave us the power
to govern our own way.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.658
- Yes, but they also
made it quite clear.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.894
We must maintain order.

07:06.994 --> 07:08.996
- Well, I don't think that order
comes from fear.

07:09.096 --> 07:13.734
It comes from providing people
with a decent quality of life.

07:13.834 --> 07:17.671
- Hmm.
I admire the impulse,

07:17.771 --> 07:20.007
but remember what
George Orwell said.

07:20.107 --> 07:21.709
- What was that?

07:21.809 --> 07:24.044
- "If you want a vision
of the future,

07:24.144 --> 07:27.781
imagine a boot stamping
on a human face...forever."

07:27.881 --> 07:30.484
- Precisely my point.

07:30.584 --> 07:34.454
This situation is bad enough.
We don't need to make it worse.

07:34.555 --> 07:35.789
- All right, Alan.

07:35.889 --> 07:39.192
Look, I just came by
to give you a heads-up.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.529
The Chief Minister
will be here,

07:41.629 --> 07:43.030
and he will be
reviewing everything

07:43.130 --> 07:44.765
that's going on around here,

07:44.865 --> 07:48.068
and you can explain
your policies to him.

07:48.168 --> 07:50.771
Oh, and, uh, you should know.

07:50.871 --> 07:53.574
No one else
is doing it your way.

07:57.778 --> 08:00.748
[tense music]

08:00.848 --> 08:04.051
*

08:04.151 --> 08:05.986
- Get the doors.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.793
- They know everything?

08:12.893 --> 08:14.662
- Pretty much.

08:14.762 --> 08:17.531
Not all the gory details,
but what I'm doing, yeah.

08:19.166 --> 08:22.069
They're good at it.
They like it.

08:23.904 --> 08:26.106
Which makes me a shitty parent,
on some level.

08:26.206 --> 08:28.141
[both laughing]

08:29.977 --> 08:31.779
- Yeah,
I couldn't tell my kids.

08:31.879 --> 08:34.648
I mean, Gracie's too young,
but...

08:36.216 --> 08:38.986
I couldn't put that burden
on Bram.

08:39.086 --> 08:41.121
Not when Will doesn't know.

08:41.221 --> 08:43.090
That wouldn't be right.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.192
- No, it wouldn't.

08:47.861 --> 08:52.600
Why'd you want to meet?
What's going on?

08:52.700 --> 08:56.704
- What if Broussard
had followed Quayle's orders?

08:59.272 --> 09:03.176
My kids need a mother.

09:03.276 --> 09:06.046
I want out.

09:10.017 --> 09:11.184
- Wow.

09:13.153 --> 09:16.724
I knew it was bad, but...

09:16.824 --> 09:20.260
- Half the cell is dead
or gone.

09:20.360 --> 09:22.763
Broussard is blown.

09:25.165 --> 09:26.634
Was it worth it?

09:29.169 --> 09:30.904
The price we paid?

09:31.004 --> 09:33.874
All those sacrifices.

09:35.042 --> 09:37.144
- I feel like I let you down.

09:37.244 --> 09:39.780
- No, no, this is not
your fault.

09:39.880 --> 09:43.784
- I should have done more about
the Quayle situation.

09:43.884 --> 09:47.120
I'll go to him and tell him
that you served your time,

09:47.220 --> 09:49.890
that he needs to leave you
and your family alone,

09:49.990 --> 09:52.059
or I'm out, too.

09:53.226 --> 09:55.195
- Thank you.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.936
[background chatter]

10:05.939 --> 10:08.375
- Reliving your glory days?
- Man, I wish.

10:08.475 --> 10:11.244
Instead, I'm going through this
stuff from Broussard's house

10:11.344 --> 10:12.913
looking for something
that might help us.

10:13.013 --> 10:14.381
- Got anything?

10:14.481 --> 10:17.617
- Well, he started three years
at linebacker,

10:17.718 --> 10:19.653
and his senior quote
was Nietzsche.

10:19.753 --> 10:21.722
- Not sure that's gonna
help us find him.

10:21.822 --> 10:26.626
- Jennifer told me to dig.
So here I am, digging.

10:26.727 --> 10:29.663
[phone rings]

10:30.931 --> 10:32.733
- Aren't you gonna
answer it?

10:32.833 --> 10:36.804
- First time it's rung
since I took over the office.

10:36.904 --> 10:38.205
Bowman.

10:38.305 --> 10:39.406
- You've been looking
for a leak

10:39.506 --> 10:41.809
in your department.

10:41.909 --> 10:43.210
- Who is this?

10:43.310 --> 10:45.713
- Someone who knows
the source is your wife.

10:50.083 --> 10:53.320
Do I have your attention?

10:53.420 --> 10:55.288
- Yeah, sure.
Go ahead.

10:55.388 --> 10:58.859
- Take a walk to Wilshire.
Get on the next Red Line bus.

10:58.959 --> 11:01.194
Number 33.

11:01.294 --> 11:03.663
If I so much as sniff
surveillance,

11:03.764 --> 11:07.067
I'm gone.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.268
[click, dial tone]

11:14.241 --> 11:15.876
- What the hell
was all that?

11:15.976 --> 11:18.946
- Anonymous tip
from our favorite cell.

11:19.046 --> 11:21.281
Probably just a crank.

11:21.381 --> 11:24.217
- Probably.
- I'm gonna check it out anyway.

11:24.317 --> 11:27.855
- You want some company?
- Don't want to waste your time.

11:35.362 --> 11:35.729
.

11:35.796 --> 11:37.865
[deep bass engines
thrum]

11:50.110 --> 11:51.845
- Thank you for traveling

11:51.945 --> 11:53.280
with the Transitional
Authority's Red Line

11:53.380 --> 11:55.448
from Westwood to Larchmont
in 15 minutes,

11:55.548 --> 11:57.084
all day, every day.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.028
- How's the gardening?

12:08.128 --> 12:11.799
- [laughs] Well, that's our
business, isn't it?

12:11.899 --> 12:13.466
Planting seeds,
watering them,

12:13.566 --> 12:15.803
hoping they'll grow
into something useful.

12:15.903 --> 12:17.938
- That how you know my wife?

12:19.439 --> 12:22.742
- I run her cell.

12:22.843 --> 12:24.211
You don't seem surprised.

12:24.311 --> 12:25.478
- Broussard work for you?

12:25.578 --> 12:27.147
- I know he's the guy
you want,

12:27.247 --> 12:29.416
and I'm prepared
to give him up.

12:29.516 --> 12:31.084
I've decided to make a deal,

12:31.184 --> 12:33.053
and you're gonna negotiate
on my behalf.

12:33.153 --> 12:35.155
- And why would I do that?

12:35.255 --> 12:37.891
- Because you're invested.

12:37.991 --> 12:40.293
If you succeed,
I'll disappear,

12:40.393 --> 12:42.495
and your wife's secret
will disappear with me.

12:42.595 --> 12:45.332
If you fail,
her name will be

12:45.432 --> 12:49.036
the first thing I spill
under interrogation.

12:49.136 --> 12:50.470
- People died for you,

12:50.570 --> 12:52.039
and you're just gonna
sell 'em out?

12:52.139 --> 12:55.208
- [softly] You know,
you work for the Occupation.

12:55.308 --> 12:59.112
Do I really need to justify
anything to you?

13:03.050 --> 13:04.818
Here are my terms.

13:04.918 --> 13:07.420
I'll roll on my cell,
absent your wife, of course.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.990
In exchange, they will get me
outside the bloc

13:10.090 --> 13:13.226
in downtown Los Angeles
in a fully-stocked pickup truck.

13:13.326 --> 13:15.495
- Why?
What's outside the Walls?

13:15.595 --> 13:18.832
- Pockets of survivors.
The RAPs leave them alone.

13:22.970 --> 13:24.504
- Thank you for traveling...

13:24.604 --> 13:26.506
- Here's my number.

13:26.606 --> 13:29.109
Call me when
you're ready to deal.

13:29.209 --> 13:31.311
- All day, every day.

13:31.411 --> 13:33.480
Next stop, Hauser.

13:35.082 --> 13:37.851
[background chatter]

13:40.587 --> 13:43.056
- Is it really safe
to meet here?

13:45.125 --> 13:47.360
There's a church
around the corner.

13:47.460 --> 13:49.162
- We're not meeting
in a church.

13:49.262 --> 13:51.965
- [scoffs]
This is really conspicuous.

13:56.369 --> 13:57.570
- All right.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.907
Walk with me.

14:07.948 --> 14:10.150
What can I do for you?

14:10.250 --> 14:12.920
- So you're the guys
who pulled the Snyder job?

14:13.020 --> 14:15.355
- Let's say we were.

14:15.455 --> 14:18.191
- I have a group of...
skilled individuals

14:18.291 --> 14:20.928
who are trying to do
the same thing as you.

14:21.028 --> 14:23.030
- Uh-huh.

14:23.130 --> 14:25.398
- Were you affiliated
with Geronimo?

14:25.498 --> 14:26.633
- No.

14:26.733 --> 14:28.568
- Did you ever have
any contact with him?

14:28.668 --> 14:30.370
- How's that relevant?

14:30.470 --> 14:33.373
- Because I heard that
you were his tactical arm.

14:35.242 --> 14:39.212
We need someone who can handle
those kinds of details.

14:39.312 --> 14:41.014
For an operation.

14:41.114 --> 14:44.317
- What kind of operation?

14:44.417 --> 14:46.653
- We have intel that a VIP
is coming into the bloc

14:46.753 --> 14:49.289
for some big meeting,
someone way bigger than Snyder.

14:49.389 --> 14:52.092
We've got a date,
a location,

14:52.192 --> 14:54.461
and the means of transit.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.964
- Who's your source?

14:57.064 --> 15:01.434
- Let's just say that we have
some proprietary technology.

15:03.236 --> 15:06.406
[tense music]

15:06.506 --> 15:08.675
- What's that?
- It's our business plan.

15:08.775 --> 15:12.412
- Business plan.
- Yeah. For the operation.

15:14.547 --> 15:17.550
We've done our due diligence.

15:38.171 --> 15:40.507
- Want to take a walk?
- You bet.

15:42.775 --> 15:45.245
- Gracias.
- Gracias.

15:52.119 --> 15:55.088
- Damn, these are good!
- [chuckles]

15:55.188 --> 15:58.058
I'm telling you.
- Mmm.

15:59.526 --> 16:02.062
- So...

16:02.162 --> 16:04.231
I'm guessing this is about
that phone call.

16:07.667 --> 16:11.671
- I think I might have found
the source of our leak.

16:14.107 --> 16:17.410
- Yeah? Who's that?

16:17.510 --> 16:19.079
- Me.

16:22.349 --> 16:25.285
- Interesting theory.

16:25.385 --> 16:27.554
- The guy who called claims to
be running Broussard's cell.

16:27.654 --> 16:30.490
He wants to come in.
Cut a deal.

16:34.561 --> 16:37.664
- And you're worried about
who he might bring with him.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.501
- Yeah.

16:45.205 --> 16:48.441
- You know, I'm wondering
what might happen

16:48.541 --> 16:50.110
if Broussard learned

16:50.210 --> 16:53.380
that someone
was trying to sell him out.

16:53.480 --> 16:56.283
- The cell might
clean up their own mess.

16:58.151 --> 17:00.420
- It's a dangerous game.

17:02.789 --> 17:04.491

17:11.398 --> 17:13.133

17:13.233 --> 17:16.069
- Uneasy is the head
that wears the crown, Will.

17:16.169 --> 17:18.371
- Well,
I've got some good news.

17:18.471 --> 17:21.274
- Why do I find that
hard to believe?

17:21.374 --> 17:23.410
- A low-level operative
in Broussard's cell

17:23.510 --> 17:25.145
just walked in the door.

17:25.245 --> 17:26.546
He's willing to roll
on his crew.

17:26.646 --> 17:28.081
Names, locations, everything.

17:28.181 --> 17:29.649
- And why, exactly,

17:29.749 --> 17:32.752
is this operative
betraying his own cell?

17:32.852 --> 17:34.754
- Because we broke them.

17:34.854 --> 17:37.757
He knows it's his last
opportunity at leverage.

17:37.857 --> 17:39.626
- What's this gonna
cost me?

17:39.726 --> 17:44.397
- He wants out of the bloc with
a fully-supplied pickup truck.

17:44.497 --> 17:47.100
- Outside the Wall?

17:52.139 --> 17:54.341
All right, I'm willing
to consider an arrangement.

17:54.441 --> 17:56.543
But I want to meet him.
Face to face.

17:56.643 --> 17:58.278
- [scoffs]

17:58.378 --> 17:59.679
I don't think
that's a good idea.

17:59.779 --> 18:01.348
- I don't care.

18:01.448 --> 18:02.815
I can't afford another
disaster,

18:02.915 --> 18:05.252
so this goes
directly through me.

.

18:14.827 --> 18:17.430
[deep bass engines

18:20.667 --> 18:22.169
- I went by your house.

18:22.269 --> 18:24.671
It looked like
a Redhat convention.

18:30.510 --> 18:33.346
- How'd they find it?
- You know how.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.182
- It's not her.

18:38.185 --> 18:40.153
Why'd you lie about
knowing Geronimo?

18:40.253 --> 18:41.821
- You kidding?

18:41.921 --> 18:44.224
That Geronimo shit
was for the mob, not you.

18:44.324 --> 18:46.226
I thought
you saw right through it.

18:55.802 --> 18:58.371
- So what now?

18:58.471 --> 19:00.740
- We do
what we set out to do:

19:00.840 --> 19:03.576
fight until they're gone.

19:05.945 --> 19:09.582
- Hennessey put me in contact
with another cell.

19:09.682 --> 19:12.219
They got solid intel
on a big operation.

19:12.319 --> 19:15.222
A VIP is coming into the bloc
from the outside.

19:15.322 --> 19:17.857
They have a comprehensive plan
for the op.

19:17.957 --> 19:20.827
They just need our tactical
expertise to pull it off.

19:23.396 --> 19:25.698
Let me know what you think.

19:31.238 --> 19:34.507
[low chatter in other room]

19:38.845 --> 19:41.314
- I want to talk to you
about this morning.

19:43.450 --> 19:45.752
It's not like you
to do something like that

19:45.852 --> 19:48.455
without talking to me
first.

19:51.291 --> 19:54.294
Gracie did not understand
at all.

19:54.394 --> 19:56.429
She just kept asking,

19:56.529 --> 19:59.966
"If they know where Charlie is,
why can't he come home?"

20:00.066 --> 20:02.835
- They deserved to know.

20:04.404 --> 20:05.872
- Maybe.

20:05.972 --> 20:07.807
I deserved to be
a part of figuring out

20:07.907 --> 20:10.443
when and how to tell them.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.312
- Okay.

20:14.414 --> 20:15.782
- "Okay," what?

20:15.882 --> 20:19.452
- Okay, I'll try and do better
next time.

20:20.853 --> 20:23.456
- What is going on
with you today?

20:29.396 --> 20:31.864
- We caught a big break
at work.

20:31.964 --> 20:35.768
The head of their cell
came in today.

20:35.868 --> 20:37.837
- "Came in"?
- He wants to deal.

20:37.937 --> 20:40.407
I think he's spooked.

20:40.507 --> 20:43.543
He's willing to give up
Broussard to save his own ass.

20:47.714 --> 20:49.816
Don't worry.
This is a good thing.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.651
Once this guy rolls
on his cell,

20:51.751 --> 20:54.321
we don't have to look
over our shoulders anymore.

20:54.421 --> 20:56.856
- That's great news.

21:00.327 --> 21:01.561
- What?

21:03.095 --> 21:04.731
It's just a lot.

21:06.466 --> 21:08.501

21:08.601 --> 21:10.570
- I'm glad you're home.

21:10.670 --> 21:14.006
I told Ben I'd cover the late
shift tonight at the Yonk.

21:14.106 --> 21:16.843
- Go for it.
I'll hold down the fort.

21:19.879 --> 21:21.714
- You've reached
Bronson Construction.

21:21.814 --> 21:24.317
No one's available.
Please leave a message.

21:24.417 --> 21:26.619
- I have an emergency.
It's my, uh, porch.

21:26.719 --> 21:29.689

is about to fall down.

21:50.710 --> 21:53.312
I mean, that sure as hell
wasn't there a year ago.

21:53.413 --> 21:55.715
- Why is it so blurry?

21:55.815 --> 21:58.985
Did I get the wrong lens?
- No, your lens is decent.

21:59.085 --> 22:01.320
It just wasn't ground
for the specific optics

22:01.421 --> 22:02.655
of this telescope.

22:02.755 --> 22:03.856
- Well, what can we do?

22:03.956 --> 22:05.558
- We need professional gear.

22:05.658 --> 22:08.728
We need infrared
or a radio telescope.

22:09.996 --> 22:11.731
- What do you think's
up there?

22:11.831 --> 22:14.701
- It's a base,
a shipyard or a mine,

22:14.801 --> 22:16.603
and that's why
we never see 'em.

22:16.703 --> 22:18.371
- Because they live up there?

22:18.471 --> 22:20.473
- Well, it's just conjecture
until we can get

22:20.573 --> 22:23.376

whatever's going on.

Especially not here.

22:56.909 --> 22:58.144
So?

22:58.244 --> 23:00.980
- Quayle sold us out.
- Bullshit.

23:01.080 --> 23:02.749
- It's coming straight
from Will.

23:02.849 --> 23:05.117
Quayle's trying to cut a deal
with the Occupation.

23:05.217 --> 23:07.554
- Maybe Will
is manipulating you.

23:07.654 --> 23:10.490
- Excuse me?
- Maybe he suspects you.

23:10.590 --> 23:12.425
Maybe he's feeding you
bad information.

23:12.525 --> 23:14.727
- So you think I'm the one
being manipulated?

23:14.827 --> 23:16.729
- I think your emotions
are clouding your judgment.

the same thing to you.

that other cell.

up to Griffith Park.

were headed to your house,

I still called you.

Do you know why?

Because you're the reason
I joined the Resistance,

23:44.657 --> 23:47.960
and not Quayle.

23:48.060 --> 23:51.631
- The man is a lot of things,
Katie, but he's not a sell-out.

23:51.731 --> 23:53.566
He saved my ass
five or six times

23:53.666 --> 23:55.735

much easier to just walk away.

23:55.835 --> 23:57.704

have a history.

24:42.982 --> 24:45.484
This comes from Katie,
right?

Use your head.
Her husband got to us.

24:50.623 --> 24:52.892
Got to you.
They know your real name.

24:52.992 --> 24:56.062
They found your house,
and that was deeply hidden.

24:56.162 --> 24:58.598

was the one who tipped me

24:58.698 --> 24:59.799
that the Redhats were coming.

24:59.899 --> 25:01.768
- Well, maybe she knew
they were coming

25:01.868 --> 25:03.269

Maybe she's playing

my question.

the Occupation?

No, I am not.

the details.

I mean,
it has got to be a base.

26:34.961 --> 26:37.163
- Maybe it's the Factory.

26:37.263 --> 26:39.932
I did some research,

26:40.032 --> 26:43.035
and there's all kinds of
specialized equipment

26:43.135 --> 26:45.004
at USC and up on Mount Wilson,

26:45.104 --> 26:47.273

to destroy that stuff

outside the Colony.

28:34.814 --> 28:36.282
and I have no desire

28:36.382 --> 28:38.717
to live under the thumb of you
or your compatriots

28:38.818 --> 28:39.952
or the RAPs.

28:40.052 --> 28:42.021
I want a Transit Pass,

28:42.121 --> 28:44.957
coded to let me through
whatever Wall I want.

28:45.057 --> 28:46.725
Irrevocable.

28:50.462 --> 28:53.099
Hey, come on.
Don't act dumb.

28:53.199 --> 28:55.467
You know they exist.

28:58.570 --> 29:01.140
They're issued by
the Governor-General's office.

29:01.240 --> 29:02.775
The bloc governors
don't have authority

29:02.875 --> 29:04.911
over the transit zones.

29:05.011 --> 29:09.281
The pass, and a fully-stocked
pick-up truck.

29:09.381 --> 29:11.450
To avoid confusion,
here's a list.

29:15.922 --> 29:18.357
- And I get Broussard.
- I'll set up a meeting.

29:18.457 --> 29:20.092
Broussard'll be there.

29:20.192 --> 29:23.095
Along with some other
bonus prizes.

29:23.195 --> 29:25.932
And then, when everyone
is in your custody,

29:26.032 --> 29:29.435
your man Bowman here will
escort me through the Wall

29:29.535 --> 29:31.070
and out of the Colony.

29:37.276 --> 29:40.412
- All right.
You have a deal.

29:44.917 --> 29:47.119
- One piece of advice.

29:47.219 --> 29:50.022
When you're going after
Broussard...

29:50.122 --> 29:52.992
don't miss.

30:00.499 --> 30:00.867
.

30:00.933 --> 30:03.870
[crowd chatter]

30:09.275 --> 30:12.244
[suspenseful music]

30:12.344 --> 30:20.252
*

30:36.302 --> 30:39.138
[overlapping radio chatter]
- Section one secure.

30:39.238 --> 30:41.307
- There's the signal.
Broussard's here.

30:41.407 --> 30:42.608
- Keep in contact.

30:57.656 --> 30:59.391
- So where is he?

31:01.493 --> 31:03.595
- He's here.

31:09.601 --> 31:12.404
[tense music]

31:12.504 --> 31:20.512
*

31:26.118 --> 31:27.153
- Redhats.

31:27.253 --> 31:29.488
Redhats.

31:29.588 --> 31:37.329
*

31:37.429 --> 31:38.931
- It's blown.

31:44.070 --> 31:47.139
[crowd screams]

31:47.239 --> 31:48.540
Go. Go, Rachel, go!

31:48.640 --> 31:51.510
[firecrackers popping]
[people screaming]

31:53.579 --> 31:56.082
- Protect the asset. We got him.
Let's go, let's go!

31:56.182 --> 31:58.184
- Potential target
taking evasive action.

31:58.284 --> 32:00.619
White female, short brown hair,
blue shirt.

32:00.719 --> 32:02.554
Officers, engage.

32:02.654 --> 32:05.124
[shouting, commotion]

32:10.162 --> 32:11.263
- [screams]

32:11.363 --> 32:12.464
- No!

32:18.704 --> 32:20.239
[gasps]

32:22.541 --> 32:25.511
[crowd screaming, shouting]

32:26.778 --> 32:28.647
- Do we have eyes on the target?

32:28.747 --> 32:30.416
- Negative. He blew past
Lagarza's position,

32:30.516 --> 32:33.652
then we lost him in the chaos.

32:33.752 --> 32:35.687
- You had one job!
Protect the perimeter!

32:35.787 --> 32:38.457
- I got her.
- You don't got shit.

32:40.259 --> 32:43.395
- Will? Come in.
What's up?

32:46.532 --> 32:49.035
- We lost him.

32:49.135 --> 32:52.004
[somber music]

32:52.104 --> 33:00.079
*

33:02.448 --> 33:05.317
- I just want to know how
this man somehow escaped

33:05.417 --> 33:07.719
a battalion of Redhats
specifically positioned

33:07.819 --> 33:09.455
to capture him.

33:09.555 --> 33:13.225
- Because he's a pro.
- And mistakes were made.

33:13.325 --> 33:15.261
But the cell's blown up.

33:15.361 --> 33:17.329
Broussard's gonna have a very
hard time operating.

33:17.429 --> 33:20.332
- Yeah, I bet we'll never hear
from that guy again.

33:20.432 --> 33:22.734
Bravo. Truly excellent work.

33:22.834 --> 33:26.338
Like finishing third
in the Super Bowl.

33:26.438 --> 33:28.174
- I have something
you need to see.

33:28.274 --> 33:30.142
The informant?

33:30.242 --> 33:32.311
We captured him with one of
the cameras in the market,

33:32.411 --> 33:35.147
so I cross-matched his face
in the Rolodex.

33:35.247 --> 33:36.582
Alexander Quayle.

33:36.682 --> 33:40.186
Former CIA station chief
in Berlin.

33:40.286 --> 33:42.654
He moved to Defense Intelligence
in 2004

33:42.754 --> 33:45.057
to help run their
operations division,

33:45.157 --> 33:48.127
but was forcibly retired
after something went wrong

33:48.227 --> 33:49.761
during a mission in Beirut.

33:49.861 --> 33:51.663
The mission details
were scrubbed,

33:51.763 --> 33:55.067
but the file had a list
of the informants,

33:55.167 --> 33:59.171
including this guy,
cover name Ahmed Ali Farah.

33:59.271 --> 34:03.142
- So Quayle's obviously not
some low-level operative.

34:03.242 --> 34:04.643
Maybe we can still save
this shit show.

34:04.743 --> 34:05.644
Let's get him into
interrogation.

34:05.744 --> 34:07.346
Where is he now?

34:07.446 --> 34:09.681
- We stashed him at the
Hoover Street rendition house.

34:25.531 --> 34:25.664
.

34:25.731 --> 34:27.833
- So do you think
this is the kind of guy

34:28.534 --> 34:29.535
who knows how to keep a secret?

34:30.636 --> 34:33.805
- Not once Snyder locks him
down in that basement.

34:33.905 --> 34:36.375
- And we're not gonna let them
torture a man

34:36.475 --> 34:39.211
who served his country
now, are we?

34:42.781 --> 34:44.350
All right.

34:44.450 --> 34:46.152
Then go on in there,
get that shithead,

34:46.252 --> 34:48.387
and we'll figure it out
together.

34:54.793 --> 34:56.162
[knock at door]

35:00.199 --> 35:01.567
- I'm here to see Quayle.

35:01.667 --> 35:04.603
- Yes, sir.
This way.

35:04.703 --> 35:06.305
- Leave us alone.

35:06.405 --> 35:11.543
- I hope you brought me
a Transit Pass.

35:12.611 --> 35:14.546
- Snyder cancelled the deal.

35:16.948 --> 35:19.551
Can you disappear
in this bloc?

35:23.322 --> 35:25.191
- I could hide in your house
for six months.

35:25.291 --> 35:27.426
You'd never even know
I was there.

35:27.526 --> 35:30.429
But here's the play:
you claim that these idiots

35:30.529 --> 35:32.664
didn't search me
in the right way.

35:32.764 --> 35:35.534
You walked in here,
I got the jump on you,

35:35.634 --> 35:37.436
and you had to help me
out the back door.

35:37.536 --> 35:39.305
- And I never see you
again.

35:39.405 --> 35:41.440
- No one does.

35:42.708 --> 35:44.810
- Why did you recruit her?

35:44.910 --> 35:47.679
- I didn't.
Broussard did.

35:47.779 --> 35:51.917
Your wife
is an admirable woman.

35:52.017 --> 35:55.287
Rebellion is in her bones.

35:55.387 --> 35:58.424
She truly believed
she could've made a difference.

35:58.524 --> 36:01.593
But the truth is...

36:01.693 --> 36:03.729
we're kidding ourselves.

36:03.829 --> 36:08.267
But Katie has hope, and hope can
keep you going a long time.

36:08.367 --> 36:09.868
- How did he get to her?

36:09.968 --> 36:14.240
- Broussard and I both saw
great potential in Katie.

36:14.340 --> 36:17.609
The art of deception
is a natural talent,

36:17.709 --> 36:20.746
and your wife has it
in spades.

36:24.450 --> 36:26.852
Come on. Let's go.

36:31.657 --> 36:33.659
[thud]
- Hey! What--

36:39.731 --> 36:44.270
[Quayle wheezing]

36:47.439 --> 36:49.441
[exhales]

36:50.842 --> 36:52.811
[running footsteps]

36:54.646 --> 36:56.415
- It's me.

36:56.515 --> 36:59.418
[dramatic music]

36:59.518 --> 37:07.326
*

37:12.598 --> 37:14.933
- All right.

37:15.033 --> 37:16.668
Now what?

37:26.678 --> 37:28.580
He was dead when we got there.

37:28.680 --> 37:29.948
The guards were too.

37:30.048 --> 37:31.817
- Must have been
Broussard.

37:31.917 --> 37:34.320
- How could Broussard possibly
know about our rendition house?

37:34.420 --> 37:37.823
- How's he pull off
half the things he's done?

37:37.923 --> 37:41.360
- I don't like it either, sir,
but that's how it went down.

37:42.894 --> 37:46.332
- Something about this
doesn't smell right.

37:46.432 --> 37:48.300
I want the truth,
or all the goodwill

37:48.400 --> 37:49.835
that you've built with me,

37:49.935 --> 37:51.970
favors that you thought
you were owed--gone!

37:52.070 --> 37:53.439
Good-bye!

37:58.344 --> 38:03.315
I made a mistake with you,
giving you that much latitude.

38:03.415 --> 38:05.717
The truth is simple: I own you.

38:05.817 --> 38:08.720
And if any of this backhand
bullshit continues,

38:08.820 --> 38:10.722
you will both go to
the Factory

38:10.822 --> 38:13.625
and spend the rest
of your miserable lives

38:13.725 --> 38:17.396
regretting not taking advantage
of my generosity.

38:53.064 --> 38:55.634
- [sighs]
Whoa.

38:57.803 --> 39:00.606
- Thanks.
- Yep.

39:11.883 --> 39:14.453
- I didn't have a choice.

39:14.553 --> 39:17.556
I couldn't trust Quayle.

39:17.656 --> 39:20.792
- Well, you did
what you had to do.

39:20.892 --> 39:23.429
Problem is, I don't know how
long that cock-and-bull story

39:23.529 --> 39:26.097
we told Snyder
is going to hold up.

39:28.600 --> 39:31.102
- What's Big Bear like
this time of year?

39:31.202 --> 39:35.006
- Whew, man.
Damn nice.

39:36.708 --> 39:39.811
Ha. But there is
the small matter

39:39.911 --> 39:43.549
of a 300-foot Wall
standing in our way.

39:43.649 --> 39:45.484
- There is.

39:49.888 --> 39:53.124
[overlapping chatter]

39:55.661 --> 39:58.630
[somber music]

39:58.730 --> 40:06.538
*

40:08.474 --> 40:11.843
- You shouldn't have come.

40:11.943 --> 40:14.513
Listen, I'm radioactive,

40:14.613 --> 40:16.482
so we can't
see each other for a while.

40:16.582 --> 40:17.916
- [sobs]

40:18.016 --> 40:20.018
- But this isn't over.

40:20.118 --> 40:23.088
Opportunity will come again,

40:23.188 --> 40:27.659
and when it does,
I want you there with me.

40:27.759 --> 40:29.695
Katie...

40:29.795 --> 40:34.099
This is why we fight.

40:34.199 --> 40:36.034
- I know.

41:17.943 --> 41:21.012
- We still fighting?

41:21.112 --> 41:23.749
- You tell me.

41:23.849 --> 41:24.883
- [sighs]

41:27.619 --> 41:30.221
I hope not.

41:41.633 --> 41:44.770
How was your day?

41:44.870 --> 41:46.672
- Fine.

41:46.772 --> 41:48.640
Yours?

41:50.208 --> 41:54.179
- Good. My day was good.

41:54.279 --> 41:56.514
The cell that attacked us
is done.

41:58.784 --> 42:01.820
Their leader and a couple of
others are dead.

42:03.889 --> 42:07.525
You don't have to worry
about them anymore.

42:16.167 --> 42:19.170
[dark music]

42:19.270 --> 42:27.212
