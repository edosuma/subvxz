00:10.875 --> 00:12.458
parents to have

00:12.500 --> 00:15.750
a summer theater program

00:12.500 --> 00:15.750
at Get Sporty this year.

00:15.792 --> 00:17.959
- I know,

00:15.792 --> 00:17.959

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000

00:20.041 --> 00:22.417
I mean, I've always wanted

00:20.041 --> 00:22.417

00:22.458 --> 00:24.000
- I don't get it.

Who's gonna come

00:24.041 --> 00:25.834
to a theater in a sports store?

00:25.875 --> 00:27.875
- Zip it, Franco.

00:27.917 --> 00:29.834
- Now, now, theater and sports

00:27.917 --> 00:29.834
go together.

00:29.875 --> 00:32.333
After all, theater is the--

00:29.875 --> 00:32.333
[imitates swishing sound]

00:32.375 --> 00:35.208
sport of the soul.

00:32.375 --> 00:35.208
- Yeah!

00:35.250 --> 00:38.625
Oh, yeah. Get Sporty doesn't

00:35.250 --> 00:38.625
just support drama on the field,

00:38.667 --> 00:41.792
we also support

00:38.667 --> 00:41.792
drama on the stage.

00:41.834 --> 00:44.333
- Or a real theater was too

00:41.834 --> 00:44.333
expensive to rent out this year.

00:44.375 --> 00:45.792
- Zip it, Franco.

00:45.834 --> 00:48.375
- Okay, well for anyone

00:45.834 --> 00:48.375
who wants to audition,

00:48.417 --> 00:50.333
the sign-up sheets

00:48.417 --> 00:50.333

Dawn Harper for Dorothy,

00:56.166 --> 00:57.834
the role I was born to play.

00:57.875 --> 01:00.083
Boom.

01:00.125 --> 01:02.291
- I'm signing up

01:00.125 --> 01:02.291
for the good witch.

01:02.333 --> 01:04.291
I'll hold my boom

01:02.333 --> 01:04.291
until I get it.

01:04.333 --> 01:06.792
- I wanna be a winged monkey.

01:06.834 --> 01:09.166
Some people think they're scary.

01:09.208 --> 01:10.917
But I think they're cute.

01:12.250 --> 01:13.959
- I'm gonna sign up

01:12.250 --> 01:13.959
to be the director.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.250
I like power, not fame.

01:17.583 --> 01:20.333
- Miles, what are you gonna do?

01:20.375 --> 01:21.750
- I don't know.

01:20.375 --> 01:21.750
On the one hand,

01:21.792 --> 01:23.041
I could play a tree.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.375
But on the other hand,

01:23.083 --> 01:25.375
I could just

01:25.417 --> 01:26.834
sell popcorn during the show.

01:26.875 --> 01:29.291
I just can't decide.

01:26.875 --> 01:29.291
- You always make

01:29.333 --> 01:30.667
the right decision.

01:30.709 --> 01:32.166
- But I'm gonna

01:30.709 --> 01:32.166
go with the tree.

01:32.208 --> 01:33.792
- Huh.

01:33.834 --> 01:35.291
- Popcorn it is.

01:35.333 --> 01:37.959
- So, boys, who are you

01:35.333 --> 01:37.959

01:38.000 --> 01:40.959
- Sorry, Mom. This play thing

01:38.000 --> 01:40.959
really isn't our thing.

01:41.000 --> 01:46.667
- Well, I am psyched for it.

01:41.000 --> 01:46.667
I mean, ever since I was a

01:41.000 --> 01:46.667

01:41.000 --> 01:46.667
of playing Dorothy.

Whoa, whoa, that was

01:58.500 --> 02:00.750
- Oh, my gosh. I love you.

02:00.792 --> 02:02.333
- I worship you.

02:00.792 --> 02:02.333
- I live for you.

- I have a picture of you

02:13.583 --> 02:16.792

- Well, we were gonna

02:18.208 --> 02:19.917
but Ericka is gonna

be our guest director.

02:19.959 --> 02:22.125
[all exclaim]

02:24.083 --> 02:26.625

02:24.083 --> 02:26.625
in a sporting goods store

02:26.667 --> 02:29.375
and she still came?

02:29.417 --> 02:31.333
- Young man, I don't know you.

02:31.375 --> 02:35.667
But theater is the sport

02:31.375 --> 02:35.667

02:35.709 --> 02:37.959
- Ah! [laughs]

02:38.000 --> 02:40.417
I was just making that up.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.417
- So good.

02:40.458 --> 02:43.667
- I came back to stage

02:40.458 --> 02:43.667
the finest production

02:43.709 --> 02:47.500
of "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"

02:43.709 --> 02:47.500
this town has ever seen.

02:47.542 --> 02:49.500
Well, since my production.

02:49.542 --> 02:55.500
I didn't just play Dorothy.

02:49.542 --> 02:55.500
I was Dorothy.

02:55.542 --> 02:57.000
Anybody else just get a shiver?

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
- Shiver, Franco.

03:01.041 --> 03:03.750

03:14.667 --> 03:17.542
discovered in this production.

03:17.583 --> 03:20.291
Just like I was.

03:17.583 --> 03:20.291
- Ah, oh, my brothers

03:20.333 --> 03:22.041

03:20.333 --> 03:22.041
- Yes, we are.

03:22.083 --> 03:24.583
- Totally our thing.

03:22.083 --> 03:24.583
- Make me your Toto.

03:24.625 --> 03:26.500
- Come on, Ericka,

03:24.625 --> 03:26.500
we'll show you the theater.

03:26.542 --> 03:28.875
- I'll see you at the auditions.

03:28.917 --> 03:29.542
- Can't wait!

03:28.917 --> 03:29.542
- Bye!

03:29.583 --> 03:31.291
- Bye!

03:31.333 --> 03:33.542
- But I thought you guys

03:31.333 --> 03:33.542
weren't auditioning.

03:33.583 --> 03:36.500
- Well, that was before she said

03:33.583 --> 03:36.500
we could become famous.

03:36.542 --> 03:37.959
- Oh, I think she was

03:36.542 --> 03:37.959
talking to me.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
I mean, she got discovered

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
playing Dorothy.

03:40.041 --> 03:41.750
And so will I.

03:41.792 --> 03:44.333

03:41.792 --> 03:44.333
anything to do with it.

- Oh, no.

03:47.500 --> 03:49.750
It's Rose Dirken.
