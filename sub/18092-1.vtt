WEBVTT

01:31.540 --> 01:33.713
While Hitler pounds
the allies in Europe,

01:34.009 --> 01:36.250
American Troops under
the command of General MacArthur

01:36.578 --> 01:38.717
are forced to retreat
from the advancing Japanese

01:39.014 --> 01:40.186
to the safety of Australia.

01:40.715 --> 01:42.626
During transit, two black pumas,

01:43.018 --> 01:45.191
ceremonial mascots
of the newly arrived infantry,

01:45.320 --> 01:47.197
escape after a truck rollover,

01:47.322 --> 01:49.598
disappearing into the Australian Bush.

01:50.459 --> 01:52.200
Fearing a public relations disaster,

01:52.327 --> 01:55.035
MacArthur dispatches
a squad of five U.S soldiers

01:55.163 --> 01:56.836
to catch or kill the pumas.

01:57.399 --> 01:59.879
But the pumas are the least
of the squad's problems,

02:00.235 --> 02:04.706
for a far more sinister danger awaits
them in the high mountain wilderness.

02:52.854 --> 02:54.333
What's the prognosis, Corporal?

02:57.459 --> 02:58.335
Mamma Mia!

03:00.328 --> 03:02.365
Well if that ain't the cat's meow.

03:04.766 --> 03:06.302
As much as I have a fondness for pussy,

03:06.935 --> 03:08.676
I suggest we skip
the oral lesson captain

03:09.037 --> 03:10.277
And how, Sergeant Weaver.

06:18.126 --> 06:19.070
Say Captain,

06:19.794 --> 06:21.967
I saw 'Yank in the Rank"
three times,

06:22.330 --> 06:24.674
and you and Judy Garland
make a fine couple, sir.

06:25.133 --> 06:26.806
So you're the sucker
that came to see that movie, huh?

06:27.035 --> 06:29.015
Yeah sucker three times over, sir.

06:29.237 --> 06:30.682
Well you should've made it
ten times, Balkhash,

06:31.039 --> 06:32.916
They mights run it a second week.

06:34.008 --> 06:35.248
"North-West Mounted Police",

06:35.577 --> 06:37.056
"Billy the Kid's Gun Justice"

06:37.412 --> 06:39.824
I've seen them all but
'Yank in the Rank",

06:40.415 --> 06:41.393
that's favorite, sir.

06:42.317 --> 06:43.227
You know,

06:43.818 --> 06:47.129
I haven't looked at another girl's legs
since that night you left.

06:47.255 --> 06:48.598
Well I've looked at other men.

06:49.124 --> 06:51.798
Ah, but I bet you didn't look at them
the same way you looked at me...

06:52.127 --> 06:54.437
That first night in Kansas City.

06:56.297 --> 06:57.241
Ah, it's a dilly.

06:57.699 --> 07:02.114
You know, when you beat this outfit
you gotta go into show business.

07:02.237 --> 07:05.411
Maybe, maybe you'll introduce me
to Judy Garland hey Captain?

07:05.807 --> 07:06.911
Why...

07:07.242 --> 07:09.552
I'll introduce you to
a great anythings Balkhash.

07:16.317 --> 07:19.355
Say, Australia's some crazy place huh?

07:19.454 --> 07:21.195
Like you seen the animals
they got around here?

07:21.556 --> 07:23.263
"Boeing-bong-bong"

07:23.892 --> 07:25.200
I think none of them are as bad ass

07:25.460 --> 07:27.565
as the abracadabra we got
back home in Tornado Alley.

07:27.695 --> 07:29.971
Aw, Updike you're a punch drunk
hay-burner,

07:30.298 --> 07:32.073
Everyone knows the abracadabra
don't exist.

07:32.300 --> 07:36.146
Hey, Barbarella, pitfall's a guinea, how come
you sin 'tin catalysis" Mussolini's ass?

07:36.538 --> 07:39.280
- To hell with you, you dumb rube.
- Now now boys,

07:39.808 --> 07:41.549
we're all batting
for the same team here,

07:42.410 --> 07:44.913
- all for the same team.
- I don't care what you goofs think,

07:45.180 --> 07:46.682
I'm as Uncle Sam's as the rest of ya's.

07:47.282 --> 07:48.886
Three generations all in Brooklyn,

07:49.117 --> 07:51.393
I might be a wop but I ain't no fascist.

07:52.253 --> 07:53.732
You see what those guys
done to Sicily?

07:54.122 --> 07:56.728
Brooklyn? When the hell did that
become part of the States?

07:56.925 --> 07:59.428
Say, if we do get invaded
and there's a last stand,

08:00.161 --> 08:01.697
it'll be in Brooklyn. Jeez,

08:02.197 --> 08:04.370
there's some neighborhoods
even I wouldn't walk into.

08:42.135 --> 08:44.912
This is it boys,
guess we hoof it from here on in.

08:46.974 --> 08:48.783
I've never seen a puma before, Sarge,

08:49.410 --> 08:50.320
what am I meant to do?

08:50.811 --> 08:51.915
Shoot them you idiot!

08:53.881 --> 08:57.385
Now if that ain't the biggest purple
helmeted snot Nazi I ever did see.

08:59.520 --> 09:00.931
Look at it and weep, Updike.

09:02.890 --> 09:04.631
What if I wipe your ass with it,
Mussolini?

09:05.359 --> 09:08.533
Yeah, you wipe your ass
with this, Updike,

09:08.729 --> 09:10.072
might just get you into heaven.

09:11.298 --> 09:13.676
It looks like you're about
to wet your pants, Balkhash.

09:14.034 --> 09:17.015
The last Puma I saw Sergeant
was at the San Diego zoo.

09:17.371 --> 09:18.907
Well at least it was behind bars.

09:23.611 --> 09:24.555
Captain...

09:38.726 --> 09:41.570
Oh Jesus of the pure earth.

09:46.934 --> 09:47.912
Michigan!

09:59.413 --> 10:02.087
Looks like this good old boy
was trying to do himself a little hunting'.

10:04.852 --> 10:08.800
Stupid kangaroo fucker,
taking on a God-damn puma.

10:09.890 --> 10:12.803
As if a little pop gun like this
would scratch those kitty cats.

10:22.636 --> 10:24.877
Alright, Sergeant, I wanna be on top
of that bridge by sunset.

10:27.007 --> 10:29.248
We brain those pumas tonight,
tomorrow will be duck soup.

10:29.410 --> 10:32.323
Yes, sir. Alright boys
you've got three minutes,

10:32.613 --> 10:34.752
then I want a chorus
of "Teddy Bears Picnic".

10:35.049 --> 10:37.791
Barbarella, Balkhash,
you got detail on the coffin.

10:38.886 --> 10:41.526
Updike, you think you can get
Muhammad to the mountain?

10:41.922 --> 10:44.630
Enough dynamite, Sarge
and I'll get the mountain to Muhammad.

10:45.059 --> 10:45.799
That a boy.

10:47.361 --> 10:51.173
- Rakish, get your ass over here.
- Coming, Sarge, right away.

10:51.799 --> 10:53.005
Son of a bitch.

10:54.768 --> 10:57.806
What the fuck's in this anyway,
Sarge, your old lady?

10:58.005 --> 11:00.781
Yeah maybe one of those wop dames
from Expositor's pork store.

11:00.975 --> 11:03.751
So Italian's like to eat, you think
we got a choice in the matter?

11:04.011 --> 11:05.752
Can the horseplay, Barbarella
and get moving,

11:06.013 --> 11:07.959
- we're burning daylight.
- Yes, Sarge.

11:09.650 --> 11:11.220
You should see how my momma eats.

11:17.891 --> 11:22.237
Say, Captain, what's that Nazi loving
eye-tie doing on this detail anyhow?

11:23.097 --> 11:25.941
I mean, God-damn
National Socialists, sir.

11:27.368 --> 11:30.474
Orders from the top, Corporal
ours is not to reason why.

11:30.838 --> 11:33.785
Yeah, well I don't like shipping out
with no fascist.

11:34.642 --> 11:36.383
This detail's crummy enough as it is.

11:39.346 --> 11:42.816
All that we are is the result
of what we thought,

11:43.450 --> 11:45.896
what we think is what we become.

11:48.856 --> 11:50.995
Billy the Kid's Gun Justice, scene 42.

11:52.059 --> 11:54.630
Don't go getting all nickel led
and deemed, Updike.

12:02.970 --> 12:05.678
Okay boys, round them up
and move them out.

12:20.754 --> 12:22.256
You boys drop that transmitter

12:22.489 --> 12:24.594
you'll be down three weeks
in the hoosegow.

12:25.292 --> 12:26.498
We'll be careful, Sarge.

12:27.928 --> 12:28.963
God damn right you will.

12:48.849 --> 12:51.955
Say, Sarge, can't we get
"The Andrew Sisters" on this thing?

12:52.086 --> 12:54.032
"Beat me, Daddy, eight to the bar..."

12:54.354 --> 12:55.799
That ain't no crystal set, Barbarella,

12:55.923 --> 12:57.732
doesn't pick up signals,
it sends 'em out.

12:57.891 --> 12:59.893
Ultra high frequencies
to attract the pumas.

13:01.095 --> 13:02.665
Like a dog signal right, Sarge?

13:02.996 --> 13:04.873
We had this old hunting dog
back home,

13:04.932 --> 13:06.809
as quick as all get-out
when my daddy blew that whistle.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.946
Oh that's exactly what it is, Updike,

13:09.369 --> 13:11.815
only damn more expensive
that your old daddy's dog whistle.

13:12.139 --> 13:15.848
Hey, Captain, how come the 96 couldn't
keep a racoons like everybody else huh?

13:16.176 --> 13:18.747
Well they wanted Lana Turner but
she was busy servicing the Joint Chiefs.

13:19.913 --> 13:21.790
Didn't the 91st have a pet monkey?

13:22.216 --> 13:23.786
Nah that was the general's wife.

13:25.018 --> 13:26.429
Maybe it was a kraut-loving hypo.

13:26.854 --> 13:27.730
Can it, Corporal.

13:27.855 --> 13:30.802
We wouldn't be on this dumb ass detail
if that rube wop didn't roll his truck.

13:30.891 --> 13:32.837
I said can it!

14:34.855 --> 14:36.994
Take it easy with that box guys.

14:39.293 --> 14:41.273
Alright, smoke 'em if you got 'em.

14:59.046 --> 15:00.184
Oh no

15:03.050 --> 15:05.291
Why you stinking, worthless kike!

15:06.186 --> 15:07.665
I was just taking a drink, Sarge!

15:07.888 --> 15:10.801
Yeah try taking a drink while I shove
that canteen up your tight Jewish ass!

15:10.958 --> 15:12.801
Don't go all hard-boiled, Sergeant.

15:13.093 --> 15:14.663
- He didn't do it on purpose.
- God-damn it!

15:14.895 --> 15:17.034
A whole stack of man hours went
into building this contraption...

15:17.798 --> 15:19.038
a whole stack of man hours.

15:21.835 --> 15:24.907
Guys I just hate to make you hump it
all this way up the mountain for nothing.

15:27.407 --> 15:29.717
Okay Private? Barbarella?

15:35.649 --> 15:36.389
Pick it up.

15:46.594 --> 15:49.473
Updike you're back on point,
this ain't no hog-tying.

15:54.969 --> 15:58.348
Shit, I can't figure
why you bums are with us.

15:59.607 --> 16:00.984
Screwball screwball,

16:02.243 --> 16:05.520
and a no good gonzo,
ought to be a law against y'all.

16:07.214 --> 16:08.784
Quit gold-bricking, keep moving...

16:09.483 --> 16:10.587
you got me to deal with.

16:55.729 --> 16:57.834
- Captain how much further?
- Not far.

17:00.568 --> 17:04.015
This will do, find a flat spot
over here, flat and level put it down.

17:06.473 --> 17:08.111
Put it on a flat spot for God sake.

17:09.609 --> 17:10.349
Jesus!

17:11.845 --> 17:13.619
- And take it easy!
- Yes, Sarge.

17:16.016 --> 17:17.757
Right there take it easy, easy, easy.

17:37.137 --> 17:38.480
Everything kosher down there,
Sergeant?

17:38.606 --> 17:41.143
Sweet as a lullaby Captain,
sweet as a lullaby.

17:43.677 --> 17:44.519
And behold...

17:46.480 --> 17:48.391
God made the heavens
and the pure earth.

17:51.118 --> 17:53.928
God's absent without leave, Sergeant,
or don't you watch the newsreels?

17:54.254 --> 17:55.324
You don't believe
in a higher power, Captain?

17:55.522 --> 17:58.594
I put faith in my own instincts
before some imaginary sky fairy.

17:59.727 --> 18:03.436
If I wasn't an Atheist before Hollywood
I sure as heck am now.

18:05.499 --> 18:06.375
Rest the men, Sergeant.

18:07.234 --> 18:08.338
Yes sir, Captain.

18:10.537 --> 18:11.413
Captain,

18:13.073 --> 18:15.053
I go the way that
providence dictates sir,

18:15.476 --> 18:17.456
with all the assurance of a sleepwalker.

18:19.613 --> 18:22.423
I'll keep that in mind sergeant,
dismissed.

18:25.252 --> 18:28.028
Okay you bunch of goldbricks,
get off your ass, we've got work to do.

18:28.255 --> 18:30.599
- Updike get some bait out ASAP.
- Sergeant

18:30.924 --> 18:33.666
Barbarella. Get some communication
going with HQ.

18:33.927 --> 18:37.170
- Yes Sarge.
- Balkhash, you got detail on the latrine.

18:37.498 --> 18:39.341
Oh come on, Sarge, I did it last week!

18:39.533 --> 18:41.410
So do it again this week!
Move your ass!

18:41.535 --> 18:42.878
Oh you gotta be kidding me...

19:08.996 --> 19:11.875
We've always been here waiting for you

19:12.533 --> 19:15.070
to take you back to the stars

19:30.050 --> 19:31.358
Oh, man.

19:43.530 --> 19:46.807
Shit, don't matter how much
of this god damn slop I eat,

19:47.234 --> 19:48.406
this stuff ain't fit for a two year old.

19:48.736 --> 19:51.478
Ah don't be a nudism, Updike,
quit your whining.

19:52.005 --> 19:56.545
Captain, do you think after the war
you can get me a shot in Hollywood?

19:57.077 --> 19:58.385
And put Lon Chaney out of a job?

19:59.480 --> 20:01.983
I love that big death scene
in "Screaming Leathernecks" Captain

20:02.316 --> 20:04.387
where you fled Germany
with those five orphans,

20:04.685 --> 20:06.323
that was some swell picture sir.

20:06.653 --> 20:08.428
You saw that too?
What are you a masochist?

20:10.290 --> 20:11.530
Not that I know of sir.

20:11.692 --> 20:13.569
Yeah, that death scene was my idea,

20:13.961 --> 20:16.237
RHO hated it
but I talked Schrieffer around.

20:16.363 --> 20:18.309
It was the best scene in the goddamn
picture, got nominated you know.

20:18.499 --> 20:20.001
- Wow!
- A good looking boy like you, Captain,

20:20.968 --> 20:23.414
I bet those Hollywood dames were just
begging you to bang their brains out.

20:24.638 --> 20:26.379
Like Judy Garland hey Captain?

20:26.607 --> 20:28.518
Say, did you get to bang her too?

20:29.476 --> 20:30.386
Might of.

20:31.011 --> 20:33.548
Come on, Captain, we'd sure
appreciate some juicy details.

20:34.314 --> 20:36.294
Yeah come on Cap, let us know.

20:36.450 --> 20:38.396
Yeah, Captain,
what have you got to hide?

20:38.652 --> 20:41.132
Oh no sir, I'm trying to,
I'm trying to give up butts...

20:41.455 --> 20:42.627
No take a closer look Balkhash.

20:47.694 --> 20:49.105
Go on, Balkhash, what's it say?

20:49.496 --> 20:52.443
To the sexiest man I know, J.G.

20:53.634 --> 20:55.545
Wow! Judy Garland?

20:56.203 --> 20:58.410
You banged Judy Garland sir?
Ain't that the berries!

20:59.506 --> 21:01.543
How about you, Balkhash?
How'd you end up in this outfit?

21:03.610 --> 21:06.420
- I mean, you'll all belly laugh sir.
- No we won't,

21:06.914 --> 21:08.587
we're all friends here, beat your gums.

21:11.418 --> 21:12.795
My father's a Rabbi in New York,

21:13.520 --> 21:15.329
wanted me to join the Yeshiva,

21:16.657 --> 21:19.900
but I started wondering sir
where it was that God actually lived,

21:20.494 --> 21:21.632
and more importantly sir,

21:22.396 --> 21:24.034
where it was that war actually lived,

21:25.132 --> 21:28.113
and the conclusion I came to sir
was that both God and war

21:28.602 --> 21:30.138
live inside ourselves,

21:30.771 --> 21:33.342
and the moment we get the fires
of peace stoked again,

21:33.640 --> 21:35.551
the sooner we'll all get on
with our lives.

21:36.977 --> 21:38.354
That's why enlisted.

21:39.079 --> 21:40.080
Who would of thought,

21:40.480 --> 21:42.892
you're pretty fucking smart
for a kid, Balkhash. I'll give you that.

21:43.483 --> 21:44.484
But, but there's one more thing I want,

21:44.885 --> 21:46.387
one thing I want
more than anything on earth...

21:46.520 --> 21:47.999
Spit it out, Balkhash.

21:49.289 --> 21:52.327
Is to be a player, sir,
to be an actor just like you.

21:53.160 --> 21:56.073
- One born every minute.
- Oh it's OK, Balkhash, good for you.

21:56.997 --> 21:58.442
A man should know what he wants,

21:58.532 --> 22:02.412
I mean if a ham like me can make it
on the silver screen you sure as hell can.

22:03.370 --> 22:05.976
You boys might be content
with putting on makeup

22:06.173 --> 22:08.153
and prancing around like
a bunch of pansies in fancy dress.

22:09.043 --> 22:10.113
I got me a man's ambition.

22:11.045 --> 22:12.752
Well don't keep it pent up, Corporal.

22:14.849 --> 22:16.419
I'm gonna be
President of the United States.

22:18.853 --> 22:20.059
Well that is a dilly!

22:21.088 --> 22:22.795
Go ahead and laugh
you bunch of blue noses,

22:23.123 --> 22:25.467
you all see, my daddy's a senator,

22:26.093 --> 22:27.436
he's gonna grease that ladder for me...

22:28.295 --> 22:29.239
nice and slippery like.

22:32.132 --> 22:33.907
You got a problem with my daddy, boy?

22:34.535 --> 22:35.707
Take it easy Updike.

22:38.772 --> 22:40.752
I ain't the one with the problem,
Corporal Updike.

22:40.975 --> 22:42.977
But ah I just like to keep
my opinions to myself.

22:45.212 --> 22:45.986
No go on, Barbarella.

22:47.047 --> 22:49.027
Speak your piece,
that's what we're fighting for.

22:55.089 --> 22:58.195
The American people
ain't stupid, Corporal Updike,

22:59.093 --> 23:00.834
they're about as likely to elect a dumb

23:00.961 --> 23:03.168
redneck cracker
asshole like you for President

23:03.797 --> 23:06.937
as they are a dime store wop like me.

23:12.172 --> 23:15.119
- Why you!
- Easy, Updike, take it easy,

23:15.609 --> 23:16.644
at ease.

23:19.613 --> 23:20.819
You're funny, Barbarella.

23:21.615 --> 23:24.289
You're a real funny boy. I like you.

23:24.685 --> 23:27.131
Yeah well I think the President
should be a straight talking man,

23:28.055 --> 23:28.931
a man of values.

23:29.156 --> 23:30.794
Someone the average
Joe can relate to, not some

23:31.091 --> 23:32.968
East Coast intellectual,
or pinko liberal.

23:34.094 --> 23:36.973
I think it's a fine ideal, Updike,
a mighty fine idea.

23:37.131 --> 23:39.042
Alright I've had enough
of this bullshit, let's go

23:39.199 --> 23:41.338
let's get this show on the road.
Barbarella I want you on the God spot,

23:41.535 --> 23:43.481
if you see one of them pumas
you nail its ass.

23:43.571 --> 23:44.675
Yes, sir.

23:50.244 --> 23:51.314
Fucker.

26:36.776 --> 26:37.811
President.

26:49.989 --> 26:50.899
Warm you up, Captain?

26:51.591 --> 26:53.070
Pasadena, Sergeant thank you.

30:42.789 --> 30:44.735
Captain, wake up! The pumas are here!

30:44.991 --> 30:46.732
Wake up, Captain they're here!
Come on,

30:46.793 --> 30:48.363
get up, get up!

30:57.537 --> 30:59.278
We couldn't wake you, sir.

31:01.274 --> 31:02.810
Over do you read me? Over...

31:17.356 --> 31:18.334
Is it a puma?

31:18.958 --> 31:20.062
Ain't no puma that big.

31:20.293 --> 31:22.136
Or some kind of bear, Updike?
Was it a bear?

31:22.662 --> 31:23.663
Ain't no bear neither.

31:23.996 --> 31:25.805
I picked a hell of a week
to give up butts.

31:54.227 --> 31:56.366
- Updike. Get back on point,
- Yes sir.

31:57.029 --> 31:58.372
We're getting the hell out of here.

31:59.932 --> 32:01.036
Slow down, Captain.

32:38.437 --> 32:39.643
Updike, where the hell are we?

32:39.972 --> 32:42.646
Dang! This is the right direction,
I'm sure of it!

32:42.909 --> 32:45.219
Well this is due east.
We followed the same path down.

32:45.245 --> 32:46.451
Yeah so where's the Jeep huh?

32:46.513 --> 32:48.083
Hell I must be losing my marbles.

32:48.615 --> 32:51.494
It should be here, right here... damn!

32:55.889 --> 32:56.833
Say, Captain...

32:58.358 --> 32:59.496
I think you need to see this.

33:11.638 --> 33:14.642
Shoot, some kangaroo fucker stole
the God-damn Jeep.

33:14.974 --> 33:17.545
Yeah, and I think some Kangaroo fucker
has stolen the God-damn road.

33:17.677 --> 33:18.917
What are you an idiot?!

33:19.445 --> 33:20.890
Jesus of the pure earth...

33:21.681 --> 33:24.161
it worked... it actually worked!

33:24.484 --> 33:25.656
What are you talking about, Sergeant?

33:38.498 --> 33:40.273
You expect me to believe
this flour-flushing shit?

33:40.400 --> 33:42.277
I know you don't believe
in anything, Captain,

33:42.969 --> 33:44.346
no need to reinforce the fact.

33:45.638 --> 33:47.140
You're O.S.S? A Colonel?

33:47.473 --> 33:51.353
It's not the road that's gone
gentlemen, we have.

33:52.478 --> 33:54.549
This radio transmitter

33:55.682 --> 33:57.218
is a time machine...

33:59.085 --> 34:01.656
a time machine.

34:10.396 --> 34:12.842
We've gone backwards,
difficult to say how far,

34:14.199 --> 34:16.339
approximately fifty thousand years.

34:17.170 --> 34:18.877
Begin' your pardon, Sarge, but,

34:19.572 --> 34:20.983
have you completely lost your marbles?

34:21.474 --> 34:23.385
You shouldn't talk that way
to a superior officer.

34:23.576 --> 34:26.351
Yeah that's right, Barbarella, don't talk
that way to a superior officer

34:26.679 --> 34:28.022
this is bullshit!

34:28.481 --> 34:31.428
A psych operation, a trick, and one
I should have been informed of.

34:31.650 --> 34:33.927
That thing that attacked us
was a marsupial lion,

34:34.454 --> 34:36.400
extinct in our time but not in this one.

34:36.556 --> 34:37.534
Updike,

34:37.956 --> 34:40.563
- plot us a course back to the base.
- There is no base.

34:40.760 --> 34:42.762
Everything within a two mile radius
of that transmitter

34:42.962 --> 34:44.464
has been shipped back in time.

34:44.530 --> 34:47.010
- Our jeep's right where we left it.
- In 1943?

34:47.199 --> 34:48.543
Now you're on the trolley.

34:49.202 --> 34:50.681
No one knew if the coffin would work,

34:51.603 --> 34:54.516
mights done nothing,
might of killed all of us,

34:55.608 --> 34:57.554
and this mission might still be
a one-way ticket.

34:57.677 --> 34:59.350
Man you are completely nuts!

34:59.479 --> 35:01.584
Don't pretend like you
just got off the boat.

35:01.914 --> 35:04.224
Negative! You put this entire squad
in jeopardy.

35:04.450 --> 35:06.430
And gladly, I'm willing to die
for what I believe in.

35:06.653 --> 35:08.394
- Yeah what's that?
- Away of life,

35:08.554 --> 35:10.397
a political system that works.

35:10.690 --> 35:14.467
Why I'd sacrifice myself and every one
of you to preserve those things.

35:15.094 --> 35:16.437
Am I right, Updike?

35:17.964 --> 35:19.136
Hell yes, sir.

35:20.166 --> 35:21.736
The way I see it, Captain,

35:22.602 --> 35:24.411
you ain't the one
giving' the orders anymore...

35:26.372 --> 35:27.544
- you all been demoted.
- Yeah,

35:28.374 --> 35:30.354
well the way I see it, Updike, is that

35:30.476 --> 35:32.581
I think you've had too much
giggle-water.

35:42.488 --> 35:43.831
May I remind all of you,

35:44.290 --> 35:47.294
refusal to obey a superior officer
in a time of war is treason.

35:53.533 --> 35:54.876
I prepared this mission,

35:55.768 --> 35:59.477
I studied all of your psychological
profiles, all of you!

36:03.009 --> 36:05.353
I know everybody's dirty little secrets.

36:24.597 --> 36:28.010
You disobey me again and I'll scrag you
good and proper, O'Brian.

36:28.334 --> 36:29.312
Understand?

36:31.971 --> 36:34.451
We've come back to the past
to save the future gentlemen,

36:35.475 --> 36:37.785
to put an end to the tyranny
of Hitler's Third Reich!

36:39.445 --> 36:41.482
Humanity will owe you all a great debt.

36:42.448 --> 36:44.553
I wanna be west of those mountains
in two hours.

36:45.518 --> 36:47.327
Updike hit the sixes,
you're back on point.

36:47.453 --> 36:48.397
Yes sir, Colonel sir.

36:48.654 --> 36:51.032
And, Barbarella you're on fire extinguisher,
let's move out.

36:53.893 --> 36:55.463
Stay outta my way grease-ball.

36:59.766 --> 37:01.507
Anybody can make history,
Corporal Updike,

37:02.535 --> 37:04.276
but only great men can write it.

37:05.905 --> 37:07.111
God bless America, sir.

37:11.644 --> 37:13.555
- Captain?
- Move out, Private.

37:13.646 --> 37:14.784
You heard the Colonel.

38:36.729 --> 38:38.675
You really believe
we've moved through time, Captain?

38:39.198 --> 38:41.508
I don't know
what I believe anymore, Balkhash.

38:43.436 --> 38:45.882
When are we gonna put that cracker
asshole back in his box, Captain?

38:48.608 --> 38:51.054
Upon the road of life
I stumbled into a dark wood,

38:52.478 --> 38:53.889
for the right path had been missed.

38:54.814 --> 38:56.088
What, what was that, Captain?

38:57.617 --> 38:59.426
Inferno in Alabama' - scene 27.

39:00.519 --> 39:01.793
Apple sauce!

39:02.722 --> 39:04.668
You see what kind of a fine
actor he is huh, Barbarella?

39:04.924 --> 39:06.835
Oh jeez, if he can act us back to 1943

39:06.959 --> 39:09.098
I'll give the man
an Academy Award myself.

39:22.808 --> 39:23.980
Hold it right there.

39:33.653 --> 39:35.530
Jesus of the pure earth!

39:50.436 --> 39:51.676
Scatter - hit the deck!

40:05.017 --> 40:05.995
Shit!

40:37.083 --> 40:38.994
What are you afraid
of a little prick?

42:29.294 --> 42:31.467
Rakish, Balkhash!

42:59.124 --> 43:00.660
Alright, we can't lollygag around.

43:00.992 --> 43:02.869
Fire up that box,
I gotta get this kid back to 1943.

43:03.128 --> 43:04.436
If he lives there's no gain.

43:05.130 --> 43:06.734
If he dies there's no loss.

43:07.766 --> 43:09.074
What the hell kind
of an animal are you?

43:09.968 --> 43:11.413
The kind of animal that follows orders.

43:17.175 --> 43:20.088
You took it out of your pants and
you should of done some thin' with it.

43:23.248 --> 43:25.956
Updike, that's enough,
enough God-dammit!

43:27.085 --> 43:28.189
Okay Updike?

43:29.054 --> 43:29.930
Okay Barbarella?

43:31.089 --> 43:35.970
You wanna get that kid back home
then you do what I say... what I say!

43:36.128 --> 43:38.039
You fucking rube,
you've condemned us all.

43:38.730 --> 43:42.075
Our salvation lies yonder, Captain,
now move out.

43:42.968 --> 43:45.073
Updike, you're on my ass... now!

43:45.971 --> 43:47.973
God damn bunch of 8-balls.

43:48.273 --> 43:51.516
God damn fucking ass holes...

43:53.211 --> 43:54.383
Anything comes sniffing
around here, Balkhash,

43:54.513 --> 43:56.686
you shoot it's God-damn ass off
you understand?

43:58.450 --> 43:59.656
I'll be right back.

45:19.731 --> 45:21.005
I didn't expect this.

45:23.936 --> 45:25.279
What were you expecting?

46:28.734 --> 46:30.077
Well, I'll be dipped in shit.

47:27.759 --> 47:29.636
We found it buried
right here in 1939...

47:30.395 --> 47:32.500
Decayed, corroded.

47:33.365 --> 47:35.345
Forgotten for over
fifty thousand years.

47:36.168 --> 47:37.476
Wait, you're saying

47:37.836 --> 47:39.747
that's where that box came from,
Colonel?

47:40.372 --> 47:41.851
That box was the only thing
salvageable,

47:42.608 --> 47:43.552
it's the heart of the ship...

47:44.076 --> 47:45.783
a quantum wave generator
that buckled time

47:45.944 --> 47:48.185
and space like a Barnum & Bailey
Circus mirror.

47:49.047 --> 47:50.492
What's our mission, sir?

47:50.849 --> 47:54.194
Why we're gonna fly that giant
suppository back to 1943

47:54.753 --> 47:56.460
and shove it up Adolf Hitler's ass.

47:57.856 --> 47:59.563
Those potato-mashers won't know
what hit 'em...

48:00.525 --> 48:04.564
Ah boys, we're gonna change
the course of human history.

48:05.397 --> 48:07.570
This time next year pigeons
will be crapping on our statues

48:07.733 --> 48:10.873
from Washington State,
to Washington D.C

48:12.838 --> 48:15.842
Just what us Italians need
another fucking statue.

48:58.650 --> 48:59.822
God-dammit!

49:05.123 --> 49:07.569
I'll get inside that thing
if it takes me all eternity.

49:08.794 --> 49:10.034
We camp here tonight!

50:02.047 --> 50:03.390
Don't sweat it Private,

50:04.049 --> 50:06.791
that ship's electromagnetic field
scares the hell out of those critters.

50:08.053 --> 50:08.929
They won't come any closer.

50:09.154 --> 50:11.134
It ain't the critters that
are eating me, Colonel.

50:11.323 --> 50:13.564
It's the fact that I'm gonna have
to eat those critters.

50:29.808 --> 50:31.651
Where's your atheism now, O'Brian?

50:32.544 --> 50:35.354
Here you are at God's doorstep
but you refuse to acknowledge it.

50:36.114 --> 50:38.094
That chunk of metal means
there might be little green men,

50:38.283 --> 50:40.024
it does not mean there's a God.

50:40.552 --> 50:42.623
Well I think it proves definitively
that there's a God

50:42.954 --> 50:44.194
and he's on our side.

50:44.956 --> 50:46.697
That sounds like something
a Nazi would say.

50:47.392 --> 50:48.666
Well maybe they'd be right.

50:49.327 --> 50:51.500
Maybe the real war
isn't man against man.

50:52.297 --> 50:53.708
Maybe it's man against God?

50:54.332 --> 50:56.676
We're gonna use that ship
to overthrow God, right?

50:57.736 --> 50:59.477
Yeah, Up dike's on the trolley,

51:00.172 --> 51:02.379
that's exactly
why God led us to the ship.

51:02.874 --> 51:03.784
Negative,

51:04.075 --> 51:07.284
whatever flew that ship is long gone
or didn't you see those graves?

51:07.879 --> 51:10.155
I wouldn't expect you
to agree with me, O'Brian.

51:11.049 --> 51:13.655
I doubt if anything like that has been
mentioned in the Torah.

51:15.754 --> 51:18.633
Oh, is that a revelation to you, boys?

51:19.558 --> 51:22.732
Our beloved Captain here
is of the Judaic persuasion.

51:23.728 --> 51:25.674
Donald O'Brian is a stage name,

51:26.631 --> 51:29.202
you wanna tell 'em
what your real handle is, Captain?

51:31.803 --> 51:33.646
Go on, Captain.
You got a right to speak...

51:34.005 --> 51:35.712
that's what we're fighting for.

51:44.649 --> 51:45.559
Undermanned,

51:47.953 --> 51:49.261
Elijah Undermanned.

51:51.723 --> 51:52.667
Shit!

51:52.958 --> 51:54.164
Well, Undermanned,

51:54.893 --> 51:57.965
I believe the destiny of man
is to rule the cosmos,

51:59.264 --> 52:04.475
to be first raised as God's children
but then to ascend and take his place.

52:08.807 --> 52:10.252
We're gonna need more water.

52:11.643 --> 52:15.489
Corporal Updike,
go fill the Captain's canteen.

52:16.281 --> 52:17.624
Yes sir, Colonel, sir.

52:18.016 --> 52:20.394
Might as well ah
fill 'em all up hey, Captain.

52:43.008 --> 52:45.352
Ain't nothin' I like better
than a round, full moon.

52:52.784 --> 52:54.627
You gonna tell me
what you want, Mussolini?

52:55.053 --> 52:56.999
I feel I owe you an apology.

52:58.523 --> 52:59.501
What?

53:00.091 --> 53:02.731
Well growing up in Brooklyn,
I seen a lot of ugly things,

53:02.961 --> 53:05.567
Protestants thumping' Catholics,
Catholics thumping' Jews,

53:05.797 --> 53:08.334
everyone running their own
little stinking' racket,

53:08.733 --> 53:10.406
talk about organized religion.

53:11.369 --> 53:13.178
What the hell kind
of tune are you plain'?

53:13.638 --> 53:15.242
I'm playing "Yankee Doodle Dandy".

53:15.440 --> 53:17.317
I'm playing
"The Star Spangled Banner",

53:17.442 --> 53:20.423
but unless we all start singing
from the same song book,

53:20.612 --> 53:23.752
then those Nazi bastards
will have us singing "Lilia Marlene",

53:24.015 --> 53:25.016
you know what I'm saying?

53:32.123 --> 53:35.468
The Colonel's gone mad,
he's all balled up,

53:36.094 --> 53:38.301
he's never gonna get inside
that tin can.

53:38.797 --> 53:40.902
Lakisha's a goner
if we don't help him quick.

53:41.633 --> 53:43.613
So, you got a better proposition?

53:44.369 --> 53:45.473
We got one chance,

53:45.971 --> 53:49.509
one chance to repair that box
and get back to 1943

53:49.808 --> 53:54.154
but that ain't gonna happen unless
we all work together, cheapish?

53:58.050 --> 54:00.530
Where I hail from a man ain't
a man unless he speaks his piece.

54:01.920 --> 54:03.729
I always admired
that about you, Barbarella...

54:04.690 --> 54:05.794
You're an honorable man.

54:11.897 --> 54:15.401
Take my hand, Updike,
I want you to accept my apology.

54:20.973 --> 54:24.944
You're my gonzo bitch,
I'm gonna cut you a vagina.

54:29.047 --> 54:31.994
The bank is open,
I'm gonna make a deposit.

54:37.856 --> 54:39.563
Bye bye eye-tie.

54:50.369 --> 54:53.111
Colonel, Colonel!

54:56.208 --> 54:57.949
He's gone, Barbarella's gone.

54:59.811 --> 55:01.552
- What?
- Gator' took him,

55:02.080 --> 55:03.957
came out of the water
and tore him all to hell and gone.

55:04.116 --> 55:05.993
Are you sure he's dead?
What if he's only injured?

55:06.184 --> 55:08.926
No way, that critter had
it self a nice bit of dago meat.

55:09.087 --> 55:12.125
Why you lying sack of shit!
I'll see you court-marshaled for this!

55:12.290 --> 55:15.100
Fuck you, you Jew faggot,
I'll tear you a new asshole,

55:15.560 --> 55:18.268
the wop was dragged into the swamp
nice and deep.

55:19.398 --> 55:21.275
Cut that shit out! The both of you!

55:22.134 --> 55:23.477
This is still a military operation.

55:25.037 --> 55:26.914
Any more insubordination Corporal,

55:27.272 --> 55:28.580
and I'll discipline you personally.

55:28.974 --> 55:31.716
Either you tie a leash around
this asshole or I'll do it myself.

55:32.010 --> 55:34.616
There'll be no more fighting
in this outfit! Am I clear?

55:36.314 --> 55:39.193
I said am I clear?

55:40.485 --> 55:41.657
Updike?

55:42.320 --> 55:43.196
Yes, sir.

55:45.323 --> 55:47.769
Both of you hit the sack.

55:49.161 --> 55:50.162
That's an order.

59:00.351 --> 59:02.592
Take you back to the stars.

59:26.844 --> 59:27.879
What's the ruckus?

59:39.957 --> 59:42.767
O'Brian, you listening to me?

59:43.995 --> 59:46.874
What in the Sam Hill are you doing,
going through the Colonel's property?

59:46.998 --> 59:50.411
He's a Colonel alright...
in the Luftwaffe.

59:51.369 --> 59:53.747
You expect me to believe
that bunch of slimy goose crap?

59:56.207 --> 59:57.914
I don't read no foreign languages.

59:59.911 --> 01:00:01.083
Then read this.

01:00:09.854 --> 01:00:10.924
Fuck.

01:00:15.493 --> 01:00:16.767
Son of a bitch!

01:00:44.488 --> 01:00:47.435
Colonel, Colonel!

01:00:48.593 --> 01:00:51.233
Come back here you God-damn
son of a bitch, Colonel!

01:00:57.969 --> 01:00:59.471
Colonel...

01:01:00.838 --> 01:01:03.250
he left us here, he left us to die!

01:01:04.075 --> 01:01:05.315
What're we gonna do?

01:01:06.444 --> 01:01:07.889
Are you listening to me O'Brian?

01:01:08.079 --> 01:01:09.888
O'Brian are you listening to me?

01:01:10.881 --> 01:01:13.327
- The name's Undermanned.
- Fuck.

01:02:10.207 --> 01:02:11.709
I hope you know
what the fuck you're doing.

01:02:17.014 --> 01:02:18.015
Are you listening to me?

01:02:20.317 --> 01:02:22.797
I said are you listening to me?

01:02:40.871 --> 01:02:41.941
God-dammit!

01:03:05.496 --> 01:03:07.203
Please Lord, don't let this be a dream.

01:04:39.223 --> 01:04:40.224
Are we back?

01:04:40.891 --> 01:04:43.098
- We're back.
- How do you know we're back?

01:04:51.001 --> 01:04:52.912
Jesus of the pure earth...

01:05:35.012 --> 01:05:37.185
Oh baby! You beautiful baby!

01:05:38.115 --> 01:05:40.686
Oh baby!

01:05:40.851 --> 01:05:41.852
Beautiful baby.

01:05:43.053 --> 01:05:44.930
You God-damn beautiful baby!

01:05:49.293 --> 01:05:51.671
Yeah! Haywood's back baby,
Haywood's back.

01:05:51.896 --> 01:05:55.810
Oh I wish I was in the land of cotton'
shit we goon back to base right now.

01:05:56.967 --> 01:05:59.379
God-Dammit, Captain I told you
we were going get back, I told you.

01:05:59.770 --> 01:06:01.841
You're gonna be on my cabinet,
you're gonna be a Senator, shit

01:06:02.806 --> 01:06:04.114
I'm gonna make you Vice President!

01:06:05.576 --> 01:06:07.954
Haywood's back, I'm back daddy,
I'm coming home,

01:06:08.212 --> 01:06:09.748
I'm gonna be President.

01:06:22.993 --> 01:06:25.234
I knew we'd do it,
I knew we'd do it.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:34.813
"Oh say have you seen, 1943".

01:06:35.372 --> 01:06:38.444
Shit we ought to get this Jeep
going right now God-Dammit...

01:06:39.743 --> 01:06:40.778
where's the God-damn key?

01:06:42.646 --> 01:06:45.957
Updike,
I hope you packed Leaseholder...

01:07:45.209 --> 01:07:49.089
This is the day when the planets
will be wreathed in dying garlands,

01:07:49.614 --> 01:07:52.424
when the abattoir
will be substituted for the guillotine.

01:07:53.651 --> 01:07:55.460
Welcome to New Germanic.

01:07:55.886 --> 01:07:57.331
Colonel, sir, is that you?

01:07:57.488 --> 01:08:00.367
Of course it's him, you can tell
by the stench of his Nazi breath.

01:08:00.725 --> 01:08:02.636
You overshot your wad, Undermanned.

01:08:03.127 --> 01:08:04.868
300 years to be precise.

01:08:05.196 --> 01:08:06.607
Seems like only yesterday.

01:08:08.132 --> 01:08:09.805
After we won the war

01:08:10.368 --> 01:08:13.645
we purged the earth of the racially
impure and the mentally inferior

01:08:14.005 --> 01:08:15.643
but our crusade won't stop there.

01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:19.145
Our National Socialist Armada
readies itself to overthrow

01:08:19.410 --> 01:08:21.151
God in the 25th dimension.

01:08:21.278 --> 01:08:23.952
The fight's not against God,
weaver, it's against ourselves.

01:08:24.615 --> 01:08:25.752
You're condemning humanity.

01:08:27.051 --> 01:08:28.859
Here you are on the edge
of extinction

01:08:29.252 --> 01:08:32.131
and still philosophizing
like one of the chosen people.

01:08:32.622 --> 01:08:34.569
I offer you a choice Corporal Updike,

01:08:34.892 --> 01:08:37.099
renounce your flag, join the Armada.

01:08:37.528 --> 01:08:42.068
Help us achieve our final victory
or die with the Jewish scum.

01:08:54.612 --> 01:08:56.591
I knew you were one of us.

01:09:34.852 --> 01:09:38.322
What do you have to say fo ryourself,
Lieutenant Updike?

01:09:41.492 --> 01:09:42.493
Hal Hitler!

01:09:45.729 --> 01:09:49.143
It's time for you to prove your loyalty
to National Socialism my son.

01:09:49.834 --> 01:09:52.337
But first, lets make this
an even playing field.

01:09:59.043 --> 01:10:00.078
Lieutenant Updike.

01:10:00.444 --> 01:10:03.550
You will give these two prisoners
exactly ten seconds head start

01:10:03.881 --> 01:10:05.087
Jawline, man Fuhrer!

01:10:05.449 --> 01:10:07.520
You better not lollygag around,
O'Brian,

01:10:07.718 --> 01:10:10.426
I got me a hard on
for some pretty boy tail.

01:10:10.888 --> 01:10:20.070
One, two, three, four, five, six,

01:10:20.798 --> 01:10:23.074
seven, eight, nine, ten.

01:10:37.248 --> 01:10:38.352
Go, go, go, come on.

01:10:49.693 --> 01:10:51.070
Now come on, come on...

01:10:51.562 --> 01:10:52.438
come on!

01:11:02.273 --> 01:11:04.583
Whatever it is that you've got, Captain.

01:11:05.609 --> 01:11:07.282
I don't think I got it in me sir.

01:11:07.812 --> 01:11:08.984
Okay we gotta split up,

01:11:09.647 --> 01:11:10.955
I want you to move
to that ridge over there.

01:11:11.115 --> 01:11:12.287
Let him eyeball you alright?

01:11:12.583 --> 01:11:13.653
I'm gonna come up from behind.

01:11:13.884 --> 01:11:16.330
Alright move wanna see the back
of your ass, let's go, go, go.

01:11:28.599 --> 01:11:32.672
Well well, I'm gonna stick you
like a Louisiana frog.

01:11:34.438 --> 01:11:35.439
Nice try...

01:11:38.242 --> 01:11:40.984
where's the other dirty Kike.

01:11:41.645 --> 01:11:42.953
Right on your tail.

01:11:58.529 --> 01:12:01.271
I reckon you're
gonna enjoy this boy...

01:12:48.512 --> 01:12:50.492
Now it's your turn Jew boy,

01:12:50.681 --> 01:12:53.161
you picked the wrong week
to give up butts.

01:12:53.851 --> 01:12:55.262
Hey, Updike,

01:12:56.887 --> 01:12:59.390
that's hardly presidential behaviour.

01:13:03.527 --> 01:13:05.473
Got a present for you if you want it.

01:13:08.132 --> 01:13:09.611
Just might get you into heaven.

01:13:12.803 --> 01:13:15.943
I'm gonna finish you
off for good, Barbarella.

01:13:50.674 --> 01:13:52.779
I know you're here eye-tie.

01:13:53.510 --> 01:13:55.615
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

01:13:57.681 --> 01:13:58.682
Hey Barbarella,

01:13:59.049 --> 01:14:03.122
why don't you stick your head out
so I can make this nice and quick.

01:14:39.555 --> 01:14:40.556
Barbarella,

01:14:41.491 --> 01:14:43.437
I know you're a fascist boy,

01:14:44.127 --> 01:14:45.697
why don't you come down here.

01:14:46.363 --> 01:14:49.344
You can join us,
you can be one of us boy...

01:14:49.833 --> 01:14:50.937
I know you wanna.

01:14:51.768 --> 01:14:54.772
Come on, Barbarella,
they treat you nice boy.

01:14:55.372 --> 01:14:57.113
The bank is closed, Updike.

01:15:02.212 --> 01:15:03.987
This is the final deposit.

01:15:31.041 --> 01:15:32.111
Colonel...

01:15:34.511 --> 01:15:35.956
Colonel!

01:15:49.392 --> 01:15:52.464
Peer into the world, Captain
as their time has disappeared,

01:15:53.229 --> 01:15:55.800
and everything that was crooked
will now be straight.

01:15:56.132 --> 01:15:57.110
Come again, Balkhash?

01:15:58.368 --> 01:16:02.043
"Drums Along the Rio Grand",
sir - scene 165.

01:16:03.406 --> 01:16:06.751
Kid, I got something
I gotta get something off my chest.

01:16:08.078 --> 01:16:09.614
I never did bang Judy Garland.

01:16:10.914 --> 01:16:12.552
- You didn't, sir?
- No.

01:16:15.452 --> 01:16:18.592
J.G, John Garfield.

01:16:20.290 --> 01:16:24.067
A hell of an actor,
and an even better understudy.

01:16:25.528 --> 01:16:28.134
Michigan! I never
would have pegged it, Captain.

01:16:29.833 --> 01:16:31.710
Hey kid it's yours, go on.

01:16:33.169 --> 01:16:34.944
I hope I didn't disappoint you, Balkhash.

01:16:35.672 --> 01:16:38.551
Never, sir. Not in a million years.

01:16:41.010 --> 01:16:42.489
Not even in fifty thousand.

01:16:44.047 --> 01:16:44.991
Well come on boys,

01:16:45.715 --> 01:16:47.854
it's time Uncle Sam kicked a little ass.

01:17:00.997 --> 01:17:02.340
Oy vey!

01:17:02.966 --> 01:17:04.877
Michigan! You can say that again.

01:17:05.435 --> 01:17:07.972
I don't remember this
being in the Torah!

01:17:51.848 --> 01:17:54.658
As the Nazi war drums pound
across the galaxy,

01:17:55.251 --> 01:17:57.527
Barbarella, Undermanned, and Balkhash,

01:17:57.754 --> 01:18:01.065
are all that stand between
good old American freedom

01:18:01.357 --> 01:18:04.463
and the fascist domination
of the universe.

01:18:06.830 --> 01:18:07.934
Walk proud...

01:18:13.203 --> 01:18:17.913
The battle for mankind's survival
has only just begun...
