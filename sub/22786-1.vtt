&lrm;<i>Just a normal girl with a normal life.</i>

00:08.200 --> 00:10.800
&lrm;<i>But there's something about me</i>
&lrm;<i>that no one knows yet.</i>

00:10.920 --> 00:12.400
&lrm;<i>Because I have a secret.</i>

00:30.400 --> 00:33.200
&lrm;-Master, are you ok?
&lrm;-She's here.

00:36.080 --> 00:37.120
&lrm;Hello, Ladybug.

00:37.800 --> 00:40.200
&lrm;I know you never wanted me
&lrm;to bring her here again,

00:40.320 --> 00:42.240
&lrm;but you must see what she discovered!

00:42.360 --> 00:44.720
&lrm;-Show him, Marinette!
&lrm;-I've been here.

00:45.320 --> 00:47.200
&lrm;I've met you before.

00:47.320 --> 00:50.480
&lrm;You're the healer
&lrm;that cured Tikki when you was sick!

00:50.600 --> 00:54.040
&lrm;So, I'm guessing you're not really a vet?

00:54.160 --> 00:56.520
&lrm;Not really.
&lrm;That was your first day of school.

00:56.640 --> 00:58.440
&lrm;It wasn't a chance meeting either.

01:03.080 --> 01:05.440
&lrm;Marinette,
&lrm;you're always ready to help others!

01:05.560 --> 01:09.400
&lrm;I knew that day, that very moment,
&lrm;that you'd make a fantastic Ladybug.

01:09.520 --> 01:11.560
&lrm;But... who are you?

01:21.760 --> 01:24.920
&lrm;Master Fu is the last known member
&lrm;of the Order of the Guardians!

01:25.040 --> 01:29.000
&lrm;Guardians of the Miraculous.
&lrm;I'm Wayzz, Master Fu's Kwami.

01:29.120 --> 01:30.960
&lrm;It's a pleasure to meet you.

01:31.080 --> 01:33.320
&lrm;Uh... you too.

01:33.440 --> 01:37.040
&lrm;We are responsible for protecting
&lrm;and distributing the Miraculous,

01:37.160 --> 01:38.800
&lrm;for the good of all humanity.

01:39.400 --> 01:41.960
&lrm;We are chosen in childhood
&lrm;and trained for years,

01:42.080 --> 01:43.480
&lrm;<i>specially for this mission.</i>

01:43.600 --> 01:49.080
&lrm;<i>When we were much, much younger,</i>
&lrm;<i>we... I made a mistake.</i>

01:49.200 --> 01:50.960
&lrm;<i>The Guardians' Temple was destroyed,</i>

01:51.440 --> 01:53.000
&lrm;all because of me.

01:53.600 --> 01:58.440
&lrm;Two of the Miraculous were lost that day,
&lrm;the butterfly and the peacock.

01:58.560 --> 02:02.600
&lrm;Also gone forever
&lrm;was the ancient spell book.

02:02.720 --> 02:05.000
&lrm;But all it has
&lrm;are drawings of old superheroes

02:05.120 --> 02:07.040
&lrm;and a bunch of strange symbols!

02:07.160 --> 02:09.479
&lrm;Not strange to a Guardian.

02:09.600 --> 02:13.800
&lrm;Back in the days, I was never given
&lrm;the opportunity to even have a look at it.

02:13.920 --> 02:18.480
&lrm;But I've been taught enough to be able
&lrm;to partially decipher the code.

02:22.600 --> 02:27.440
&lrm;These pages contain various spells
&lrm;capable of giving Ladybug and Cat Noir

02:27.560 --> 02:31.080
&lrm;special abilities
&lrm;we haven't known about until now.

02:31.200 --> 02:33.960
&lrm;Obviously, this book is invaluable.

02:37.720 --> 02:40.920
&lrm;-Why did you take the book?
&lrm;-I... I just wanted to know

02:41.040 --> 02:43.240
&lrm;what you were hiding
&lrm;that was so important.

02:43.840 --> 02:46.240
&lrm;You... you never told me
&lrm;about those things.

02:46.360 --> 02:51.160
&lrm;I was intending to give it back to you,
&lrm;I swear, but then... I lost it.

02:51.480 --> 02:54.400
&lrm;How can I possibly trust you again,
&lrm;Adrien?

02:54.520 --> 02:57.640
&lrm;-I'm sorry. I'll get you another copy.
&lrm;-It's one of a kind!

02:57.760 --> 03:00.240
&lrm;The book's the source of my inspiration.

03:00.360 --> 03:03.600
&lrm;I didn't know that. I hardly know
&lrm;anything about you, Father.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.440
&lrm;You won't be returning to school.

03:05.880 --> 03:08.680
&lrm;You'll be homeschooled again,
&lrm;with Nathalie.

03:13.400 --> 03:16.400
&lrm;I've always believed that
&lrm;whoever possessed this spell book

03:16.520 --> 03:19.680
&lrm;must also have the peacock
&lrm;and the butterfly Miraculous.

03:19.800 --> 03:24.200
&lrm;Wait a sec. You mean, whoever owned
&lrm;the spell book could be Hawk Moth?

03:24.320 --> 03:26.560
&lrm;How did you discover this book, Marinette?

03:27.160 --> 03:29.480
&lrm;I... uh...

03:29.600 --> 03:34.360
&lrm;I found it lying on a bench in a park,
&lrm;close to... close to the school.

03:34.480 --> 03:38.760
&lrm;-You didn't see who it belonged to, then?
&lrm;-No. No, I didn't.

03:40.040 --> 03:41.080
&lrm;What a shame.

03:41.200 --> 03:44.480
&lrm;I thought we were about to discover
&lrm;the identity of Hawk Moth!

03:44.600 --> 03:46.960
&lrm;-We'd have had a chance to defeat him.
&lrm;-Uh...

03:47.080 --> 03:48.640
&lrm;I could investigate if you want.

03:49.560 --> 03:52.440
&lrm;But you must be very careful, Marinette.
&lrm;If you succeed,

03:52.560 --> 03:55.240
&lrm;you may well find yourself
&lrm;face to face with Hawk Moth.

03:55.960 --> 03:58.400
&lrm;I'll be very careful, I promise.

04:02.080 --> 04:05.000
&lrm;-Why did you lie to Master Fu?
&lrm;-I couldn't tell him Adrien

04:05.120 --> 04:08.240
&lrm;was the one who had the book.
&lrm;Adrien can't be Hawk Moth!

04:08.360 --> 04:11.720
&lrm;But what if he is? It would mean
&lrm;I'm crazy in love with a supervillain!

04:11.840 --> 04:14.480
&lrm;I can't be in love with a villain!
&lrm;I'd have to fight him!

04:14.600 --> 04:18.040
&lrm;Calm down, Marinette.
&lrm;I'm sure there is an explanation.

04:18.160 --> 04:19.839
&lrm;I need to get to the bottom of this.

04:19.959 --> 04:21.519
&lrm;Do you know where to find Adrien?

04:21.640 --> 04:23.680
&lrm;I know that boy's schedule by heart!

04:23.800 --> 04:25.240
&lrm;Let's go!

04:28.920 --> 04:33.920
&lrm;I don't see him. Something's up!
&lrm;Adrien never misses his fencing lessons.

04:36.880 --> 04:41.360
&lrm;Oh, no! This is a terrible tragedy!

04:43.200 --> 04:47.440
&lrm;-What's up with her?
&lrm;-Adrien's never coming back to school,

04:47.560 --> 04:48.520
&lrm;ever!

04:48.640 --> 04:50.320
&lrm;[sobs]

04:50.440 --> 04:53.000
&lrm;-His dad grounded him!
&lrm;-For life.

04:53.120 --> 04:55.400
&lrm;-What? Why?
&lrm;-Something about losing

04:55.520 --> 04:57.480
&lrm;this book that belongs to his dad.

04:57.600 --> 05:00.600
&lrm;His dad? Ha! Phew!

05:00.720 --> 05:03.440
&lrm;-Phew?
&lrm;-Phew... 'cause I...

05:03.560 --> 05:07.280
&lrm;I was scared it was super serious!
&lrm;I mean, yeah, sure, it really is serious,

05:07.400 --> 05:11.040
&lrm;but it's not like he's sick or anything.
&lrm;Surely we can fix this, right?

05:11.160 --> 05:13.720
&lrm;We won't just stand by
&lrm;and let this happen!

05:16.920 --> 05:19.920
&lrm;So it wasn't Adrien's book.
&lrm;It was his father's!

05:20.040 --> 05:23.360
&lrm;Adrien isn't Hawk Moth! Oh, I knew it!

05:23.480 --> 05:26.000
&lrm;Adrien doesn't have
&lrm;an evil bone in his body!

05:26.120 --> 05:30.120
&lrm;Except Adrien did take the book
&lrm;without his father's permission!

05:30.240 --> 05:33.080
&lrm;Well, he must have had
&lrm;a good reason to do it.

05:33.200 --> 05:37.480
&lrm;You realise, based on Master Fu's theory,
&lrm;Adrien's father could be Hawk Moth.

05:37.600 --> 05:39.360
&lrm;No way! It couldn't be!

05:39.480 --> 05:43.520
&lrm;Hmm... An eccentric artist,
&lrm;who never leaves his home.

05:43.640 --> 05:47.000
&lrm;Mysterious, very intelligent, but cold,
&lrm;even with his own son.

05:47.120 --> 05:49.640
&lrm;[gasps]
&lrm;This is a very strong lead, Tikki!

05:49.760 --> 05:52.080
&lrm;-Please be careful, Marinette.
&lrm;-I will.

05:53.240 --> 05:56.320
&lrm;Tikki... spots on! Ha!

06:19.280 --> 06:21.960
&lrm;<i>Has the cat got your tongue?</i>
&lrm;<i>Leave a message!</i>

06:22.080 --> 06:26.240
&lrm;Cat Noir, I think I know who Hawk Moth is!
&lrm;Get your whiskers over here fast!

06:32.040 --> 06:33.520
&lrm;What will you do without the book?

06:35.840 --> 06:37.960
&lrm;You know where this goes.

06:44.720 --> 06:46.200
&lrm;Hmm.

06:48.520 --> 06:51.360
&lrm;[crashing continues]

06:51.480 --> 06:52.640
&lrm;[music playing]

06:53.960 --> 06:57.200
&lrm;Look on the bright side. Your father
&lrm;could have found out about me!

06:57.320 --> 07:00.200
&lrm;It's a good thing
&lrm;we Kwamis can never be photographed!

07:00.320 --> 07:02.960
&lrm;Photographers have no idea
&lrm;what they're missing!

07:03.080 --> 07:06.640
&lrm;I must find that book or I'll never
&lrm;be allowed to return to school.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.040
&lrm;Return to school? Are you crazy?

07:09.160 --> 07:11.440
&lrm;No more homework, no more alarm clocks!

07:11.560 --> 07:14.280
&lrm;We should be celebrating! Hey, I know...

07:14.400 --> 07:19.000
&lrm;I named this piece&lrm;<i> El Plaggo.</i>
&lrm;It's been maturing for 999 days.

07:19.120 --> 07:20.520
&lrm;[crashing sounds]
&lrm;Oh!

07:20.640 --> 07:22.040
&lrm;What was that?

07:24.960 --> 07:26.360
&lrm;Your father is very busy.

07:31.760 --> 07:35.320
&lrm;Shouldn't Adrien be practising
&lrm;his piano right now?

07:40.880 --> 07:44.400
&lrm;I feel the wrath of a father
&lrm;betrayed by his son!

07:44.520 --> 07:46.680
&lrm;What perfect prey for my akuma!

07:55.000 --> 07:57.960
&lrm;Stay close, my little akuma.

08:02.360 --> 08:04.080
&lrm;Dark wings fall!

08:09.560 --> 08:12.560
&lrm;Uh... Why is the akuma still here?

08:13.760 --> 08:17.480
&lrm;I must become someone else
&lrm;to lead them astray.

08:17.600 --> 08:19.400
&lrm;I don't understand, Master.

08:19.520 --> 08:22.760
&lrm;Nooroo, I renounce you.

08:22.880 --> 08:24.880
&lrm;What?

08:26.920 --> 08:28.840
&lrm;Temporarily.

08:35.039 --> 08:39.720
&lrm;Come to me, my little akuma,
&lrm;and evilise me!

08:43.600 --> 08:46.840
&lrm;I am now... The Collector!

08:46.960 --> 08:50.360
&lrm;My book of inspiration
&lrm;has been taken from me.

08:50.480 --> 08:52.760
&lrm;So I shall build a new one

08:52.880 --> 08:56.240
&lrm;and perhaps pick up
&lrm;a Miraculous or two while I'm at it.

08:56.840 --> 09:00.160
&lrm;[evil laugh]

09:01.200 --> 09:02.920
&lrm;My father is angry because of me.

09:03.040 --> 09:05.040
&lrm;He won't forgive me till I find that book.

09:05.160 --> 09:07.880
&lrm;May I remind you
&lrm;that you are actually grounded?

09:08.000 --> 09:12.560
&lrm;Adrien is, but Cat Noir isn't.
&lrm;Plagg... claws out!

09:12.680 --> 09:14.400
&lrm;Oh, my!

09:31.720 --> 09:35.520
&lrm;<i>Cat Noir, I think I know who Hawk Moth is!</i>
&lrm;<i>Get your whiskers over here fast!</i>

09:35.640 --> 09:38.440
&lrm;Wow! I guess the spell book
&lrm;will have to wait a bit longer!

09:41.680 --> 09:46.040
&lrm;Nathalie, you will be the first
&lrm;of my many inspirations to come.

09:46.160 --> 09:49.280
&lrm;-Mister Agreste?
&lrm;-You will call me The Collector!

10:00.920 --> 10:05.040
&lrm;Adrien, I have a great collection
&lrm;I want to show you.

10:09.560 --> 10:10.560
&lrm;Grr!

10:10.680 --> 10:13.080
&lrm;Cheese!

10:13.200 --> 10:14.600
&lrm;[screaming]

10:19.240 --> 10:22.320
&lrm;<i>Show me the news. It's just the news!</i>
&lrm;<i>I'm Nadja Chamack--</i>

10:22.760 --> 10:24.920
&lrm;Since the book
&lrm;that filled my life is gone,

10:25.040 --> 10:28.240
&lrm;I'm going to use your life
&lrm;to fill up this new one!

10:28.640 --> 10:30.520
&lrm;<i>People of Paris...</i>

10:35.960 --> 10:37.520
&lrm;Nothing could inspire me more

10:37.640 --> 10:41.200
&lrm;than imprisoning Ladybug and Cat Noir
&lrm;in these pages forever!

10:41.800 --> 10:44.400
&lrm;[groans]

10:46.000 --> 10:48.120
&lrm;Cat Noir, what did you do?

10:48.240 --> 10:50.280
&lrm;Cat Noir, did you get my messages?

10:50.400 --> 10:54.720
&lrm;Yeah. And I can't wait to know more,
&lrm;M'ladytective! So, who's the suspect?

10:54.840 --> 10:58.680
&lrm;Gabriel Agreste.
&lrm;You know, the fashion designer.

11:00.600 --> 11:03.880
&lrm;-You got proof?
&lrm;-Uh... Um... I can't tell you.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.360
&lrm;So, I'm supposed to just accept that?

11:07.480 --> 11:10.200
&lrm;You must trust me on this.
&lrm;But it all makes sense!

11:10.320 --> 11:14.040
&lrm;Gabriel Agreste is a secretive man
&lrm;and he never leaves his house.

11:14.160 --> 11:17.200
&lrm;And get this. Check out his brand's logo.

11:17.320 --> 11:18.640
&lrm;A butterfly?

11:23.480 --> 11:25.120
&lrm;You OK, Cat Noir?

11:27.520 --> 11:29.760
&lrm;It's time to get to the bottom of this.

11:35.080 --> 11:37.960
&lrm;My plan is working perfectly.

11:38.920 --> 11:42.840
&lrm;Whoa! What happened here? Looks like
&lrm;somebody had a little tantrum!

11:46.600 --> 11:48.280
&lrm;Are you sure you're OK?

11:48.400 --> 11:50.440
&lrm;Yeah. Yeah, let's keep going.

11:50.560 --> 11:54.360
&lrm;Ah! He's got a son! Let's check his room,
&lrm;make sure nothing's happened to him!

11:54.480 --> 11:56.720
&lrm;-Where's Gabriel?
&lrm;-There is no more Gabriel!

11:56.840 --> 11:58.960
&lrm;There is only... The Collector!

12:06.080 --> 12:07.480
&lrm;You won't be able to escape!

12:23.000 --> 12:24.360
&lrm;Wait!

12:28.200 --> 12:30.360
&lrm;Nice piece, wouldn't you agree?

12:38.200 --> 12:40.320
&lrm;The akuma's gotta be in that book!

12:40.440 --> 12:43.320
&lrm;Yeah, but if we touch it, we'll disappear!

12:44.240 --> 12:46.000
&lrm;Lucky Charm!

12:52.000 --> 12:53.640
&lrm;A pedal?

12:56.880 --> 13:00.400
&lrm;I have no idea what to do with this!
&lrm;We need to stall him.

13:01.360 --> 13:04.240
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir,
&lrm;you shall be the masterpieces

13:04.360 --> 13:06.160
&lrm;in my new book of inspiration!

13:36.560 --> 13:38.840
&lrm;-My collection's growing!
&lrm;-No!

13:44.040 --> 13:47.160
&lrm;So that must mean Gabriel Agreste
&lrm;can't possibly be Hawk Moth.

13:47.280 --> 13:49.320
&lrm;-He's been akumatized.
&lrm;-You call Agreste

13:49.440 --> 13:51.560
&lrm;turning into The Collector good news?

13:57.520 --> 14:01.200
&lrm;-Gabriel Agreste's son isn't at home?
&lrm;-Maybe he's already captured him!

14:01.320 --> 14:03.400
&lrm;You think he'd take it out on his own son?

14:04.000 --> 14:07.080
&lrm;-Uh...
&lrm;-You cannot escape from me!

14:07.200 --> 14:08.480
&lrm;[evil laugh]

14:08.600 --> 14:10.800
&lrm;What if he has no pages left in this book?

14:18.000 --> 14:23.280
&lrm;But before I immortalise you, allow me
&lrm;to seize your Miraculous for Hawk Moth!

14:23.400 --> 14:25.920
&lrm;-Cat Noir, I need ammunition!
&lrm;-You need... what?

14:26.040 --> 14:28.680
&lrm;We are going to complete his collection!

14:29.960 --> 14:34.560
&lrm;-Very smart, milady! Quite ingenious!
&lrm;-Less talking, more doing!

14:42.480 --> 14:44.240
&lrm;Cataclysm!

14:56.360 --> 14:59.600
&lrm;-Ready, Cat Noir?
&lrm;-I'm always ready for you, milady!

15:10.640 --> 15:11.960
&lrm;Come on, come on.

15:14.320 --> 15:16.320
&lrm;No more ammo!

15:22.760 --> 15:24.880
&lrm;It's already full!

15:26.880 --> 15:28.600
&lrm;My book! No!

15:33.080 --> 15:35.240
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

15:43.200 --> 15:45.600
&lrm;No more evildoing for you, little akuma.

15:49.320 --> 15:51.240
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

15:55.040 --> 15:56.760
&lrm;Gotcha!

15:57.360 --> 15:59.080
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly!

16:03.240 --> 16:04.440
&lrm;Pound?

16:04.560 --> 16:06.600
&lrm;Are you OK, Fa... Sir?

16:06.720 --> 16:09.120
&lrm;Cat Noir? Ladybug? What happened to me?

16:09.240 --> 16:12.800
&lrm;You were akumatized by Hawk Moth.
&lrm;But don't worry. It's over now.

16:12.920 --> 16:15.040
&lrm;Thank you. Thank you, both of you.

16:15.160 --> 16:16.280
&lrm;[gasps]

16:16.880 --> 16:18.480
&lrm;Adrien! Where is my son?

16:18.600 --> 16:20.680
&lrm;He must be hiding.

16:20.800 --> 16:24.160
&lrm;Cat Noir's right. Otherwise
&lrm;he'd have reappeared right here.

16:24.280 --> 16:26.960
&lrm;Nothing must happen to him.
&lrm;He's too precious to me.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.400
&lrm;We're about to transform back! Goodbye.

16:30.520 --> 16:33.400
&lrm;Don't worry, sir.
&lrm;I'm sure your son is safe and sound.

16:37.440 --> 16:39.520
&lrm;See you very soon.

16:45.240 --> 16:50.640
&lrm;So, since Gabriel Agreste was akumatized,
&lrm;he can't possibly be Hawk Moth, right?

16:50.760 --> 16:54.320
&lrm;That's very probable, but how
&lrm;did you find out that Gabriel Agreste

16:54.440 --> 16:55.720
&lrm;was the owner of the spell book?

16:55.840 --> 16:57.640
&lrm;At first, I thought it belonged

16:57.760 --> 17:01.120
&lrm;to Gabriel Agreste's son, Adrien,
&lrm;'cause I saw him with it at school,

17:01.240 --> 17:04.079
&lrm;before it was stolen by a girl
&lrm;and before Tikki got it back.

17:04.200 --> 17:09.319
&lrm;And I'd only just met you, so
&lrm;I didn't know if I could tell you that.

17:09.440 --> 17:10.839
&lrm;So, yeah.

17:10.960 --> 17:14.200
&lrm;You were afraid in case the one
&lrm;you love turned out to be Hawk Moth.

17:14.800 --> 17:19.920
&lrm;What? Uh, no! Er, how did you know
&lrm;that? I mean, I don't love him at all.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.520
&lrm;[nervous laugh]

17:21.640 --> 17:25.119
&lrm;Oh, all right! Yes! Adrien is amazing.

17:25.240 --> 17:28.119
&lrm;I couldn't stand the thought
&lrm;of him being a supervillain!

17:28.720 --> 17:31.440
&lrm;You know, if we want to be
&lrm;stronger than Hawk Moth,

17:31.560 --> 17:33.000
&lrm;we have to trust each other.

17:33.400 --> 17:34.440
&lrm;I know.

17:34.560 --> 17:37.040
&lrm;But now Adrien will never
&lrm;come back to school

17:37.160 --> 17:41.080
&lrm;because I can't give him that book back!
&lrm;I'll never, ever see him again!

17:41.200 --> 17:43.080
&lrm;[sobs]

17:43.200 --> 17:46.440
&lrm;There isn't a single problem
&lrm;that can't be solved, Marinette.

17:48.800 --> 17:52.480
&lrm;These modern inventions
&lrm;really are quite incredible. Hmm.

17:54.520 --> 17:58.240
&lrm;So, when Adrien put the book down and
&lrm;walked away, I wanted to take a peek.

17:58.360 --> 18:02.600
&lrm;See, I thought it was a portfolio with
&lrm;pictures of him, 'cause he's so cute!

18:02.720 --> 18:07.280
&lrm;Er, but you already knew that.
&lrm;Anyway, um, when he came back,

18:07.400 --> 18:10.520
&lrm;I was scared he'd see me staring at it,
&lrm;so I hid it in my backpack.

18:10.640 --> 18:13.760
&lrm;And I know it was a dumb thing to do.
&lrm;I'm really, really sorry.

18:13.880 --> 18:17.160
&lrm;I see. So, you're one of his admirers?

18:17.280 --> 18:20.320
&lrm;Admirers, yeah, that's the word.

18:21.200 --> 18:22.800
&lrm;You won't say anything to him?

18:25.880 --> 18:28.080
&lrm;Will you let Adrien come back to school?

18:28.680 --> 18:30.920
&lrm;Well, considering he didn't lose my book,

18:31.040 --> 18:33.760
&lrm;as it was borrowed by you, yes, I will.

18:34.760 --> 18:36.600
&lrm;Thank you!

18:42.800 --> 18:44.640
&lrm;Can I ask you a question?

18:46.000 --> 18:49.440
&lrm;I flipped through the book
&lrm;and it looked really awesome.

18:49.560 --> 18:54.320
&lrm;Those illustrations of legendary heroes
&lrm;are super... inspiring.

18:54.440 --> 18:57.800
&lrm;-Where did you get it?
&lrm;-I found it while on a trip overseas.

18:57.920 --> 19:00.120
&lrm;I've never seen another copy of it.

19:00.240 --> 19:02.760
&lrm;Well, then you're very lucky to own it.

19:08.880 --> 19:11.120
&lrm;That was really brave, what you just did.

19:11.720 --> 19:16.040
&lrm;Thanks. All that matters is for Adrien
&lrm;to be allowed out of the house again.

19:20.200 --> 19:22.320
&lrm;I'm sorry I became so furious over a book.

19:23.640 --> 19:25.880
&lrm;I shouldn't have taken it without asking.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.560
&lrm;That book was the very last gift
&lrm;your mother gave to me before...

19:29.680 --> 19:33.600
&lrm;before she disappeared. All I have left
&lrm;of her is this book... and you.

19:34.200 --> 19:37.240
&lrm;But I know I can't keep the book,
&lrm;or you, locked up forever.

19:37.360 --> 19:40.120
&lrm;Does that mean
&lrm;you'll let me go back to school then?

19:42.280 --> 19:44.200
&lrm;Thank you, Father!

20:04.560 --> 20:06.880
&lrm;So, then, if you already had
&lrm;a copy of the book,

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
&lrm;why did you go through all that trouble?

20:09.120 --> 20:12.960
&lrm;I did what I had to do to keep my secret.

20:29.960 --> 20:33.600
&lrm;-Happy to see me again?
&lrm;-At your service, Master!

20:35.880 --> 20:38.960
&lrm;Nooroo, dark wings rise!

20:44.360 --> 20:48.920
&lrm;Ladybug, Cat Noir!
&lrm;You almost managed to find out who I am,

20:49.040 --> 20:52.000
&lrm;but now I am more above suspicion
&lrm;than I've ever been.

20:52.600 --> 20:55.920
&lrm;As of today, nothing will prevent me
&lrm;from getting your Miraculous,

20:56.040 --> 20:58.280
&lrm;and making my greatest wish come true!

20:58.880 --> 21:02.840
&lrm;All I need to do now
&lrm;is wait for my next prey.
