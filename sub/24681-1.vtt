<i>In New York City's
war on crime,</i>

00:04.451 --> 00:06.442
<i>the worst criminal offenders
are pursued</i>

00:06.520 --> 00:09.455
<i>by the detectives
of the Major Case Squad.</i>

00:09.523 --> 00:11.184
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:13.894 --> 00:16.727
Come on, Linda. Let 'em out to play.

00:17.597 --> 00:21.055
<i>But I'm in the
kitchen, Ray.</i>

00:22.135 --> 00:24.126
<i>What if somebody sees me?</i>

00:24.571 --> 00:28.439
Honey, it's just you, me and the FCC.

00:28.775 --> 00:31.403
<i>Okay,
I did it. I took it off.</i>

00:31.478 --> 00:32.502
<i>You happy now, Ray?</i>

00:32.579 --> 00:39.280
Well, sweetie, that depends. Are
they berries, mangos or melons?

00:42.756 --> 00:48.490
Linda? Hey... Where'd
she go? She hang up on me?

00:48.562 --> 00:50.120
<i>Ray, I'm sorry, I dumped her.</i>

00:50.197 --> 00:52.256
<i>I cut to commercial.
We're off the air?</i>

00:52.332 --> 00:55.597
<i>Lenny made me promise,
you start talking breasts...</i>

00:57.838 --> 00:59.032
<i>Lenny!</i>

01:02.609 --> 01:04.236
You told Pete to cut me off?

01:04.311 --> 01:05.972
We went over this.

01:10.117 --> 01:15.214
Linda, if you're still listening,
I didn't cut you off, baby.

01:16.156 --> 01:18.386
That was my producer,
Lenny.

01:19.092 --> 01:21.151
He used to have brass ones,

01:21.228 --> 01:26.598
but now he lets the FCC keep
them in a box in Washington.

01:28.001 --> 01:29.730
We should've let him walk
when we had the chance.

01:29.803 --> 01:31.703
Well, you wanted to
be more controversial.

01:31.772 --> 01:33.569
Not at the cost of our license.

01:33.640 --> 01:36.131
You found him, Lenny.
You lose him.

01:39.012 --> 01:40.673
Bye.
Listen...

01:40.947 --> 01:42.414
Later.
... I put Danny's math review

01:42.482 --> 01:44.143
on top of his bag.

01:44.718 --> 01:46.345
Ruben told me what happened
at the station, Ray.

01:46.420 --> 01:48.320
Are you trying to
get yourself fired?

01:48.388 --> 01:49.685
Can we not talk
about this now?

01:49.756 --> 01:52.748
You have obligations,
Ray. Stop playing games.

01:56.096 --> 01:57.290
I will.

01:58.098 --> 01:59.929
$9,500.

02:03.403 --> 02:05.234
Let's make it $9,300.

02:06.239 --> 02:08.207
He's home.
I have to go.

02:14.681 --> 02:15.807
Is it here?

02:15.882 --> 02:18.578
I can't get it, Mr. Ray.
I'm sorry.

02:22.155 --> 02:24.646
I put your dinner in the microwave.

02:28.728 --> 02:31.492
It's okay, Lusa.
I'm not hungry.

02:33.000 --> 02:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:49.182 --> 02:50.240
Ray.

02:51.218 --> 02:55.052
I've got something for you,
Lenny, pal.

04:04.691 --> 04:07.125
Lusa called and said the
station was looking for him.

04:07.193 --> 04:08.455
Ray has never
missed a show.

04:08.528 --> 04:11.326
He was late just once this
year, when he had the flu.

04:11.398 --> 04:12.922
You and your husband are separated?

04:14.568 --> 04:16.160
We're getting a divorce.

04:16.236 --> 04:18.829
We checked the apartment.
Nothing looks out of place.

04:18.904 --> 04:21.499
There's no sign of a struggle.
Bed hadn't been slept in.

04:21.575 --> 04:23.406
Just... Can I?
Yeah.

04:23.476 --> 04:26.206
Is there anywhere else
that he might have slept?

04:26.279 --> 04:27.576
I don't think so.

04:27.647 --> 04:32.016
Yesterday, he come home and go into
his little studio down the hall.

04:32.886 --> 04:35.446
He didn't even want me
to heat up his dinner.

04:36.122 --> 04:38.352
He always say
he's not hungry.

04:39.492 --> 04:40.516
Paroxetine.

04:40.594 --> 04:45.554
Ms. Garnett, do you know how long your
husband was taking anti-depressants?

04:45.632 --> 04:48.931
A few months. He got a
prescription to quit smoking.

04:49.903 --> 04:52.963
<i>So, your husband is
missing less than 24 hours.</i>

04:55.508 --> 04:57.669
Is there a particular
reason why you're worried?

04:57.744 --> 04:59.905
Ray has never
just disappeared.

05:01.081 --> 05:04.778
His show is very controversial,
he's made a lot of enemies.

05:09.789 --> 05:12.383
I was on the ferry reading, when
I looked up and there he was.

05:12.459 --> 05:13.949
He pulled out this
letter of resignation.

05:14.027 --> 05:15.051
He was about to sign it,

05:15.128 --> 05:18.894
when the letter accidentally blew
out of his hand and into the water.

05:19.399 --> 05:23.233
Ray is a funny guy. His
wife said he made enemies.

05:23.670 --> 05:24.932
With his show?

05:25.005 --> 05:26.336
Anti-indecency groups,
mostly.

05:26.406 --> 05:29.068
The FCC came down hard
on him. He had been fined.

05:29.743 --> 05:31.210
Him and the station?

05:31.277 --> 05:33.745
Right, yeah. We took steps to
comply with the regulations.

05:33.813 --> 05:36.782
We set up call screenings
last month and tape delays.

05:37.350 --> 05:39.682
You signed him to a
new deal five months ago.

05:41.021 --> 05:43.512
Now, "pay or play," that means that

05:44.624 --> 05:48.151
he could get fired, but you'd still
have to pay him the full 10 mil?

05:48.228 --> 05:49.718
Unless we fire
him for cause.

05:49.796 --> 05:52.356
Cause? Like him not
showing up for work today?

05:52.432 --> 05:54.764
It's funny how that
works out for you guys.

05:54.834 --> 05:57.325
Yeah, sure. I pushed him off the ferry.

05:57.837 --> 06:00.237
He was drinking last
night, probably tied one on.

06:00.306 --> 06:02.274
It's the same reason he
was late six months ago.

06:02.342 --> 06:04.674
His wife told us
he had the flu.

06:05.311 --> 06:06.573
Right.
Try hangover.

06:07.047 --> 06:09.345
His eyes were red,
he smelled like vomit.

06:09.416 --> 06:10.747
I know what hangovers
look like.

06:10.817 --> 06:15.550
Okay, the show that
he did six months ago,

06:17.424 --> 06:19.585
we need a tape of it.

06:19.659 --> 06:20.785
Sure.

06:23.196 --> 06:26.825
<i>Before we take another call,
I guess we have to do weather?</i>

06:26.900 --> 06:30.358
<i>Sorry, the smog
is lousy this morning.</i>

06:30.804 --> 06:32.863
<i>So how's traffic?</i>

06:33.640 --> 06:36.370
<i>Oh, crap, I just
did traffic, didn't I?</i>

06:37.744 --> 06:39.336
He has the flu,
you can hear it.

06:39.412 --> 06:41.778
He's congested,
he's hoarse.

06:41.848 --> 06:45.875
He's disoriented, his
thinking is fragmented.

06:45.952 --> 06:47.476
We talked to
his pharmacy.

06:47.554 --> 06:51.456
He got his first prescription for
anti-depressants a week after this show.

06:51.524 --> 06:53.515
Because he was depressed.

06:53.927 --> 06:55.121
Suicidal.

06:56.196 --> 06:57.288
No.

06:57.530 --> 07:01.330
Raw throat, red eyes,
the vomiting.

07:04.838 --> 07:07.807
It could be carbon
monoxide poisoning.

07:15.048 --> 07:18.984
We were at the beach house. He went
into the garage and started the car.

07:20.587 --> 07:22.521
He told me he stopped because
he didn't want the kids

07:22.589 --> 07:25.183
finding Daddy dead in the family car.

07:27.460 --> 07:29.826
We needed to know
that this morning.

07:29.896 --> 07:34.026
Ray made me promise not to tell
anyone because he was in negotiations.

07:34.100 --> 07:37.399
Anyway, that was six months
ago. He's on medication.

07:39.005 --> 07:42.566
He spent the long weekend since the
suicide attempt at a clinic upstate.

07:42.642 --> 07:45.202
Since then,
has his condition improved?

07:45.278 --> 07:48.213
He's still in his own world.
He still doesn't listen.

07:48.281 --> 07:50.010
That didn't change.

07:51.284 --> 07:53.479
Last time,
he left a suicide note?

07:53.553 --> 07:56.545
He made a tape. He had
it with him in the car.

07:57.557 --> 07:59.821
Ray loves the sound of his own voice.

08:06.132 --> 08:09.033
Maid said that he went into
his home studio last night.

08:09.102 --> 08:11.696
If he made a suicide tape
and he had it with him,

08:11.771 --> 08:13.204
he wouldn't have
jumped off the ferry.

08:13.273 --> 08:16.208
The salt water would
have destroyed the tape.

08:16.276 --> 08:17.573
He'd go with
what he knows.

08:17.644 --> 08:20.078
Carbon monoxide.
He's still on the boat.

08:21.548 --> 08:23.379
Once the ferry
gets underway,

08:23.449 --> 08:26.475
this whole area fills
up with carbon monoxide.

08:46.039 --> 08:48.473
<i>Kelly,
it's not your fault.</i>

08:48.541 --> 08:49.769
<i>Or the kids'.</i>

08:50.343 --> 08:52.538
<i>Whatever I do,
I end up hurting you.</i>

08:52.779 --> 08:54.713
<i>I'm tired of hurting the people I love.</i>

08:55.415 --> 08:57.713
There anything else in the tox report?

08:59.953 --> 09:03.855
No. Low level of alcohol, maybe
a beer within an hour of death.

09:04.524 --> 09:09.484
<i>And paroxetine at levels consistent
with a daily dosage of 40 milligrams.</i>

09:09.829 --> 09:12.889
It's what you'd expect for someone
being treated for major depression.

09:12.966 --> 09:16.333
But his voice was flat,
he lost his appetite.

09:17.303 --> 09:19.965
It doesn't sound like
his medication was working.

09:20.039 --> 09:23.440
<i>Well, I'm no shrink, but 40
milligrams of paroxetine a day</i>

09:23.509 --> 09:25.500
is enough to make
a hound dog smile.

09:25.578 --> 09:27.808
If he was
taking it every day.

09:28.214 --> 09:32.116
You test hair to check
for long-term use.

09:34.888 --> 09:37.118
You could narrow
it down to months.

09:37.190 --> 09:38.282
Weeks.

09:40.059 --> 09:41.617
Garnett's hair
told the story.

09:41.694 --> 09:46.063
There was no trace of paroxetine in
the last four weeks of hair growth.

09:46.833 --> 09:49.199
He went off his meds? Why
didn't he suicide back then?

09:49.269 --> 09:54.673
Well, when they first put you on paroxetine,
they give you 10 milligrams a day.

09:55.375 --> 09:58.674
A week later, 20,
then 30, up to 40.

09:59.345 --> 10:02.974
And then when it's time to
stop, it's the same in reverse,

10:03.049 --> 10:06.780
<i>40 down to nothing over
a period of a few weeks.</i>

10:08.021 --> 10:10.956
But if you stop cold turkey, the
drug takes time to clear your system.

10:11.024 --> 10:13.549
You cruise for a while,

10:13.626 --> 10:18.222
and then you crash
into a suicidal spiral.

10:19.565 --> 10:21.465
Did anyone notice
he stopped taking his pills?

10:21.534 --> 10:23.968
Actually, people saw
him taking yellow pills.

10:24.037 --> 10:25.868
Had to be placebos.

10:25.939 --> 10:27.338
Someone
switched the medication?

10:28.574 --> 10:30.474
What about the drug the
ME found in his blood?

10:30.543 --> 10:31.976
It was just a daily dose.

10:32.045 --> 10:34.605
After being off it for a month,
one dose wouldn't do him any good.

10:34.681 --> 10:36.945
The pills we found in the
kitchen were the real deal.

10:37.016 --> 10:40.315
Somebody switched his
medication back, but too late.

10:42.822 --> 10:46.656
Last time he tried to kill
himself, his kids stopped him.

10:47.360 --> 10:49.954
This time,
he was fighting chemistry.

10:50.530 --> 10:51.997
Chemistry won.

10:52.065 --> 10:53.293
Murder by suicide.

10:59.372 --> 11:01.602
Kept his prescription
in here.

11:01.908 --> 11:06.072
Whoever switched these pills, they
might have touched these bottles.

11:07.814 --> 11:11.580
Besides the kids, last few
weeks, anyone else been in here?

11:12.852 --> 11:14.444
Just Mrs. Garnett.

11:14.520 --> 11:17.978
When the boys stay here, she
come to take them to school.

11:18.691 --> 11:21.421
We have to take your elimination
prints to separate your prints

11:21.494 --> 11:23.485
from others that we find.

11:24.163 --> 11:25.630
If you say.

11:25.698 --> 11:28.690
Police don't need reason
to do what they want.

11:33.072 --> 11:36.200
Mr. Garnett's little studio,
down the hall here?

11:41.381 --> 11:43.508
<i>I'm the easy target,
my friend.</i>

11:43.583 --> 11:46.643
<i>But after those creeps
shut me up, you're next.</i>

11:46.919 --> 11:49.114
Trying to make
yourself deaf?

11:49.389 --> 11:51.914
Garnett had his
earphones turned up.

11:52.291 --> 11:55.488
His wife said he loved
the sound of his own voice.

11:56.062 --> 12:00.931
I found cash withdrawals, around
$9,000 once a month for a year,

12:01.000 --> 12:03.491
leading up to his
first suicide attempt.

12:03.569 --> 12:08.700
Then nothing,
until three days ago.

12:08.775 --> 12:11.266
A withdrawal slip
for $9,300.

12:11.344 --> 12:12.368
It's odd amounts.

12:12.445 --> 12:15.972
All just under the $10,000
federal reporting limits.

12:16.049 --> 12:17.914
He might have been doing
something illegal with the money.

12:17.984 --> 12:19.645
Gambling or drugs...

12:19.719 --> 12:22.347
His wife said he was in his own world.

12:24.724 --> 12:26.214
His earphones...

12:28.628 --> 12:33.258
Might have had a hearing loss caused
by an addiction to painkillers.

12:34.467 --> 12:37.630
The clinic he was at six
months ago, they'd know.

12:40.773 --> 12:44.504
He did individual and group therapy
in the three days he was here,

12:44.577 --> 12:47.171
and I gave him the
anti-depressant paroxetine.

12:47.246 --> 12:49.043
Helped him stay away from painkillers.

12:49.115 --> 12:51.845
But if he stopped
getting paroxetine,

12:53.553 --> 12:57.649
he might go back to
painkillers, isn't that right?

12:58.324 --> 13:01.020
Now, did he say where
he was getting them from?

13:01.094 --> 13:05.963
He told us he bought the OxyContin from
an unnamed friend who had a prescription.

13:06.532 --> 13:08.557
Nelda did the intake on Mr. Garnett.

13:08.634 --> 13:10.966
Nelda, this is
Detective Eames and...

13:11.037 --> 13:12.629
Detective Goren.

13:13.239 --> 13:19.200
Now, Mr. Garnett, did he tell you,
how much OxyContin he was taking?

13:19.278 --> 13:20.643
80 milligrams a day.

13:20.713 --> 13:25.377
His unnamed friend, what condition
would they be taking it for?

13:25.451 --> 13:29.478
80 milligrams or more would
be for severe spinal injury,

13:29.555 --> 13:34.652
bone cancer, post-amputation
pain... I could make you a list.

13:36.996 --> 13:39.794
Well,
we'd appreciate it.

13:44.237 --> 13:46.899
I printed out Ray's address
book and appointment calendar.

13:46.973 --> 13:48.907
I also got
his phone log.

13:48.975 --> 13:52.274
We can crosscheck with
the dates of the withdrawals.

13:52.545 --> 13:56.538
Maybe he called his suppliers the
same day he took out the money.

13:57.650 --> 13:58.639
What are you
trying to do?

13:58.718 --> 13:59.912
There was one
of the pictures...

13:59.986 --> 14:03.581
Kids behind a steering
wheel. How do you get it back?

14:03.656 --> 14:08.320
You can't. It's a wallpaper program.
It plays a random selection of images.

14:08.394 --> 14:09.656
This one.

14:10.830 --> 14:14.527
The knob on the steering wheel,
it's a hand control for a car.

14:14.634 --> 14:17.194
Phantom pain
from an amputated limb.

14:17.270 --> 14:21.604
That's one of the chronic pain
conditions that was on the nurse's list.

14:22.275 --> 14:25.472
It's a hand control for
someone with an amputated leg.

14:25.545 --> 14:27.843
There's gotta
be a better shot.

14:32.451 --> 14:34.442
And Bingo was his name-o.

14:45.598 --> 14:49.295
Mr. Gregorian? I'm Detective
Eames, this is Detective Goren.

14:49.368 --> 14:50.767
What do you want?

14:50.836 --> 14:52.326
It's about your car,
the sedan.

14:52.405 --> 14:55.397
You have a hand control
on the steering wheel?

14:55.474 --> 14:56.771
Yes,
I have artificial leg.

14:56.842 --> 15:00.403
But I don't drive this car
so much anymore, my wife does.

15:01.113 --> 15:03.638
Your wife, Lusa,
Mr. Garnett's maid.

15:04.884 --> 15:07.148
Do you mind if we
wait till she gets home?

15:07.220 --> 15:08.380
Lusa's home.

15:08.454 --> 15:11.218
We rang the doorbell, nobody answered.

15:11.290 --> 15:15.818
Lusa? Lus? I don't know,
maybe she go shopping.

15:16.195 --> 15:17.856
And left her car?

15:19.599 --> 15:21.123
Wash day today?

15:33.246 --> 15:34.577
Lusa!

15:37.016 --> 15:40.383
Gregorian's employer confirms
he was at work all day.

15:42.455 --> 15:45.117
Looks like she was interrupted
folding the laundry.

15:45.191 --> 15:46.988
There was a struggle.

15:48.628 --> 15:52.189
There's one bruise the size
of a fist on each breast.

15:52.265 --> 15:54.130
It's probably a woman.

15:54.867 --> 15:58.860
A guy would just hit her in the face
or on the shoulder to knock her down.

16:00.940 --> 16:06.845
Mr. Gregorian, do you know of anyone
who would want to hurt your wife?

16:07.513 --> 16:11.449
No. She just work.
She work very hard.

16:13.753 --> 16:16.517
You still have pain
where your leg used to be.

16:16.589 --> 16:19.285
I hear that it
can be unbearable.

16:19.725 --> 16:21.352
It's not so bad anymore.

16:21.427 --> 16:23.395
What do you
take for it?

16:24.930 --> 16:26.261
OxyContin?

16:27.700 --> 16:31.261
Did you sell Ray Garnett the
extra pills you didn't use?

16:37.443 --> 16:42.904
Okay. Mr. Ray, he push
Lusa to sell my pills.

16:44.150 --> 16:45.742
I was happy when he
stopped taking them.

16:45.818 --> 16:47.376
It was too much
to worry about.

16:47.453 --> 16:51.116
Last week, Mr. Garnett took
out more money for pills.

16:51.190 --> 16:53.624
She don't sell
to him anymore.

16:53.693 --> 16:55.183
We're in too much trouble already.

16:55.728 --> 16:57.525
What kind of trouble?

16:59.231 --> 17:01.028
With the drug police.

17:02.401 --> 17:05.700
Lusa say they visit her
in Mr. Ray house last month.

17:06.204 --> 17:08.332
They know he was
taking the pills.

17:09.208 --> 17:10.800
Lusa was scared.

17:11.277 --> 17:15.906
Because police don't need a
reason to do what they want.

17:19.984 --> 17:21.885
We checked with Narco, with the Feds,

17:21.954 --> 17:24.787
nobody was investigating
Garnett or his maid.

17:24.857 --> 17:29.260
Sounds like someone intimidated the maid
to gain access to Garnett's apartment.

17:29.328 --> 17:30.659
Gained access to manipulate

17:30.730 --> 17:32.493
Mr. Garnett's
anti-depressants.

17:32.565 --> 17:34.829
And this same person killed the maid?

17:34.900 --> 17:36.595
That's what we're going with for now.

17:36.669 --> 17:38.500
I mean, the only people that
knew about Garnett's addiction

17:38.571 --> 17:42.530
was the staff at the clinic and
the patients in his group therapy.

17:42.608 --> 17:45.577
I'm supposed to convince
a judge to order the clinic

17:45.644 --> 17:48.374
to give us the names of those patients?

17:48.447 --> 17:50.176
That would be nice.

17:50.249 --> 17:54.015
Maybe if we had an idea
who you were looking for.

17:54.086 --> 17:55.713
A woman, 20 to 40.

17:55.788 --> 17:57.312
Knows about
anti-depressants,

17:57.390 --> 18:01.224
either because she's in the medical
field or because she takes them herself.

18:01.293 --> 18:05.127
Doesn't that describe the majority
of the women at the clinic?

18:06.031 --> 18:09.489
Garnett's murder took
planning by someone focused,

18:10.002 --> 18:12.232
intelligent, but with
an explosive temper.

18:12.304 --> 18:14.932
And what might have set
them off to kill Mr. Garnett?

18:15.007 --> 18:17.475
Garnett's meds were switched
four or five weeks ago.

18:17.543 --> 18:21.172
FCC cracked down and his station

18:21.247 --> 18:23.340
started screening his
calls from listeners.

18:23.416 --> 18:26.681
Which might have made some
of his regulars unhappy.

18:29.922 --> 18:33.824
This one, when I blocked her, she kept
calling, like, 10, 12 times an hour,

18:33.893 --> 18:36.157
screaming at me
to put her through.

18:36.228 --> 18:38.753
She finally stopped a few weeks ago.

18:39.698 --> 18:42.496
<i>I guess you want
me to get comfortable?</i>

18:42.802 --> 18:46.795
<i>And I want you to tell me about
this college class you're taking.</i>

18:47.840 --> 18:52.743
<i>I don't know why I keep calling
you, Ray. It always ends up the same.</i>

18:52.812 --> 18:57.806
<i>Face it, Susan, if it didn't, I
wouldn't take your calls. Is he gone?</i>

18:58.184 --> 19:00.618
<i>He left for work
five minutes ago.</i>

19:01.086 --> 19:04.954
<i>Ray, I know you think you
hurt the people around you.</i>

19:05.024 --> 19:08.687
<i>You disappoint them, but
you never disappoint me.</i>

19:09.228 --> 19:12.129
<i>Did I say that?
I must be losing my mind.</i>

19:14.700 --> 19:19.660
The suicide tape, "Whatever
I do, I end up hurting you. "

19:21.740 --> 19:24.004
He ever say anything
like that on the air?

19:24.076 --> 19:26.874
Ray, talk about an
actual feeling? No.

19:28.047 --> 19:31.141
There's one other place
Susan might've heard it.

19:32.051 --> 19:35.714
<i>Ray, I know you think you
hurt the people around you.</i>

19:36.355 --> 19:39.984
<i>You disappoint them, but
you never disappoint me.</i>

19:41.160 --> 19:44.220
Voice is so low.
Doesn't sound familiar.

19:45.698 --> 19:47.529
How many women
were in his group?

19:47.600 --> 19:50.592
Two. At this point, I have to bow out.

19:50.669 --> 19:52.261
I have a group to conduct.

19:52.338 --> 19:55.398
But Nelda has been fully
briefed by our lawyer.

20:01.013 --> 20:04.574
Susan presented herself
as a housewife,

20:06.886 --> 20:11.016
but she talked about a class
she was taking in college.

20:11.090 --> 20:14.389
One of the women is a
graduate student in the city.

20:14.927 --> 20:16.895
Very sweet
and soft-spoken.

20:16.962 --> 20:18.054
Why was she here?

20:18.130 --> 20:19.495
A suicide attempt.

20:19.565 --> 20:21.897
She was being sexually
harassed by a professor.

20:21.967 --> 20:24.561
She tried to jump off the
balcony of her student dorm.

20:24.637 --> 20:27.629
She was on ziprasidone,
an anti-psychotic.

20:30.009 --> 20:31.874
She was schizophrenic?

20:32.244 --> 20:36.578
No. Ziprasidone can be combined with
standard SSRI to treat depression.

20:39.285 --> 20:41.583
You're not an MD,
are you?

20:41.654 --> 20:43.622
I'm certified as
a prescribing nurse.

20:46.191 --> 20:47.556
Excuse me.

20:54.366 --> 20:56.493
How did you know
about ziprasidone?

20:56.569 --> 20:59.663
Well, my mother takes it,
for schizophrenia.

21:02.641 --> 21:05.439
You know, but it makes
her very restless.

21:05.978 --> 21:08.708
There's other drugs available
without that side effect.

21:08.781 --> 21:10.578
I could look them up.

21:12.051 --> 21:16.784
Well,
I'm sure you're very busy,

21:16.855 --> 21:20.416
and, you know, between
your job and home.

21:23.996 --> 21:26.464
You have kids?
Your wedding ring.

21:26.532 --> 21:30.730
Oh.
You're very vigilant.

21:31.537 --> 21:33.869
No, no kids.
Just my husband.

21:37.142 --> 21:40.669
She seems very nice,
your partner.

21:41.080 --> 21:42.604
She is.
She's a great partner.

21:42.681 --> 21:47.015
Really? You don't feel you carry
more than your fair share of the work?

21:47.419 --> 21:52.447
No. We have
complementary skills.

21:54.226 --> 21:56.421
It's kind of you
to say that.

22:01.000 --> 22:05.164
Sorry. That was Carver.

22:06.005 --> 22:11.443
I needed to talk to him.
Can I borrow your... Thanks.

22:19.284 --> 22:22.253
He should be careful. And so should you.

22:23.789 --> 22:25.654
He told me
about his mother.

22:25.724 --> 22:28.921
When there's a pre-disposition
to schizophrenia,

22:28.994 --> 22:31.554
it can manifest
itself under stress.

22:31.964 --> 22:33.761
You should watch him.

22:36.769 --> 22:39.431
Hey, we need to get back into the city.

22:39.972 --> 22:43.339
Thank you so much. You've
been really a great help.

22:49.982 --> 22:52.883
I'm supposed to
keep an eye on you.

22:52.951 --> 22:54.976
And I'm supposed to think
you're not carrying your weight.

22:56.588 --> 23:00.285
Splitting. It's how she forms alliances.

23:02.227 --> 23:06.220
It's splitting people
against each other.

23:09.001 --> 23:12.027
The grad student's been in
Colorado the last three months.

23:12.104 --> 23:14.572
Just for drill, get her on the phone,
make a tape for voice comparison.

23:14.640 --> 23:16.039
The nurse is
a better candidate.

23:16.108 --> 23:17.234
A married
career woman?

23:17.309 --> 23:19.368
Hard to see how she found
time to stalk Garnett.

23:19.745 --> 23:22.942
I have to...
I'll call you later.

23:27.186 --> 23:28.847
She's not married.

23:31.090 --> 23:32.489
I got those.

23:33.525 --> 23:36.085
Detective?
What are you...

23:36.161 --> 23:37.526
I didn't mean
to ambush you.

23:38.497 --> 23:42.558
You know, but this morning
you had talked about

23:42.634 --> 23:44.397
new treatments
for schizophrenia.

23:44.470 --> 23:47.371
I'm seeing my mother's doctor tomorrow.

23:47.940 --> 23:52.400
Right. I found a new
regimen using risperidone.

23:52.745 --> 23:55.543
It's less likely to
produce restlessness.

23:56.882 --> 23:59.646
How old were you when
she developed symptoms?

23:59.752 --> 24:00.912
Seven.

24:04.490 --> 24:06.685
She's been slipping away
from me my whole life.

24:06.759 --> 24:10.456
I just can't seem to let go
of her, you know what I mean?

24:10.529 --> 24:12.963
Look, thanks.

24:15.334 --> 24:18.565
Maybe I can get the name
of that drug from you.

24:18.637 --> 24:23.165
I already wrote it down.
I was gonna send it to you.

24:23.642 --> 24:24.836
Thanks.

24:29.548 --> 24:34.042
You think we could get together sometime
for a cup of coffee or something?

24:34.787 --> 24:37.119
Detective,
I'm a married woman.

24:39.858 --> 24:41.723
No, you're not, Nelda.

24:43.595 --> 24:47.031
You've been divorced
for six years.

24:49.434 --> 24:51.834
You still wear
your wedding ring.

24:53.205 --> 24:55.503
You haven't stopped
loving him.

24:55.574 --> 24:58.008
You have a big heart,
I like that.

25:00.779 --> 25:04.237
Maybe when we see each other
next time, you can call me Robert?

25:46.225 --> 25:47.385
Hello?

25:47.893 --> 25:51.420
<i>Just wanted to make sure that
you got up to your apartment okay.</i>

25:51.797 --> 25:56.564
Yes, I did. Thank you.
Good night, Robert.

26:16.221 --> 26:17.916
Voice tests on
the grad student

26:17.990 --> 26:20.083
and Nelda Carlson
were inconclusive.

26:20.158 --> 26:22.718
It doesn't seem Mr. Garnett
was at the clinic long enough

26:22.794 --> 26:24.853
for these ladies
to fixate on him.

26:24.930 --> 26:26.397
Well,
it wouldn't take much.

26:26.465 --> 26:31.562
Simple act of kindness, even a compliment
is enough to provoke a passionate response.

26:32.638 --> 26:35.163
Turn them into your
instant best friends.

26:35.240 --> 26:37.572
Borderline personality
behavior.

26:37.643 --> 26:39.508
Between these two baskets, where
do you want to put the eggs?

26:39.578 --> 26:40.602
The nurse?

26:40.679 --> 26:42.670
Well, we don't know what
her capacity for violence is

26:42.748 --> 26:45.740
or even if she's prone
to intense attachments.

26:45.951 --> 26:47.213
Ask her ex-husband.

26:47.286 --> 26:49.948
If she has a hard time
letting go, he'll know.

26:50.022 --> 26:51.649
I'll talk to him.

26:55.294 --> 26:58.092
The tape of the nurse,
what do you think?

26:58.530 --> 26:59.724
Of her?

26:59.798 --> 27:02.266
Of him.
Little personal?

27:03.402 --> 27:05.370
He was just playing her.

27:14.513 --> 27:16.378
That a souvenir badge?

27:18.150 --> 27:21.051
It's for Nelda Carlson.

27:21.119 --> 27:22.245
You pinning her?

27:24.089 --> 27:27.889
Well, she's very,
you know, empathetic.

27:30.329 --> 27:33.162
You gave her a lot
to be empathetic about.

27:44.710 --> 27:46.644
Is Nelly suspected of
something?

27:46.712 --> 27:49.840
The D.A. Might need her to
testify in a homicide case,

27:49.915 --> 27:52.406
so we need to do
a background check.

27:52.751 --> 27:56.278
I'd rather not talk to you till I,
you know, discuss it with her first.

27:56.355 --> 27:58.152
We're still friendly, you see.
No problem.

27:58.223 --> 27:59.588
We can do it
another time.

27:59.658 --> 28:01.592
Geez, I'm sorry you had to drive
all the way up to Connecticut.

28:01.660 --> 28:04.561
Next time, do what
I do, take the train.

28:04.629 --> 28:06.529
I'll keep that in mind.

28:08.400 --> 28:10.061
Oh, damn.

28:10.435 --> 28:15.304
Do you have tissue and water? My
nephew spit up on me this morning.

28:16.942 --> 28:22.471
Thank you. It's terrific, how
you and Nelly have stayed friends.

28:23.915 --> 28:26.748
Does she get along
with your girlfriend?

28:26.818 --> 28:27.910
Girlfriend?

28:27.986 --> 28:31.513
Well, the considerate person
that made that lunch for you.

28:31.590 --> 28:32.852
Oh, yeah.

28:33.325 --> 28:36.817
Nelly thought I was putting on weight,
so she worked out a diet for me.

28:36.895 --> 28:41.127
She comes over in the morning after I
leave and makes me up a bunch of food.

28:41.199 --> 28:43.759
You've got
it pretty good.

28:44.302 --> 28:46.793
She takes care of the
laundry, the groceries.

28:46.872 --> 28:49.397
All that TLC, I'm
surprised you ever left.

28:49.474 --> 28:51.567
I kicked her out.
I had to.

28:52.511 --> 28:56.174
Nelly can go from zero to
intense in about two seconds flat.

28:56.248 --> 28:57.510
I couldn't take it.

28:57.582 --> 28:59.641
Well, you didn't
kick her very far.

28:59.718 --> 29:02.585
What'd she do, cut a deal
with you to stick around?

29:04.790 --> 29:08.590
W
- VYS, that's Ray Garnett's station.

29:08.660 --> 29:13.154
Oh, yeah. Nelly got that for me.
Garnett was a patient at her clinic.

29:13.565 --> 29:15.192
I was a big fan.

29:15.634 --> 29:18.865
You listen every morning?
All those women calling in?

29:18.937 --> 29:21.701
Yeah, I know he wasn't PC,
but I'd get on one of those

29:21.773 --> 29:23.297
cell phone-free train cars,

29:23.375 --> 29:26.367
put my earphones on,
and laugh like an idiot.

29:28.080 --> 29:29.672
Why cell phone-free?

29:29.748 --> 29:32.182
All that TLC from
Nelly comes at a price.

29:32.250 --> 29:34.115
She calls every hour.

29:34.419 --> 29:36.284
My commute's the only time
I can get away from her.

29:36.354 --> 29:37.343
Oh.

29:37.422 --> 29:40.289
Like right now, she's about
a half an hour overdue.

29:45.764 --> 29:46.856
Is it...

29:46.932 --> 29:49.298
Yeah, it's my badge number.

29:50.735 --> 29:52.259
Well, it's not gonna get you out of any,

29:52.337 --> 29:54.305
you know,
traffic tickets, but...

29:55.607 --> 29:57.097
So thoughtful.

29:59.411 --> 30:02.312
Well, I wanted to show you
my appreciation

30:03.849 --> 30:08.252
for, you know, the research
you did for my mother.

30:09.254 --> 30:12.519
Well, I hope it helped.
I made a list for you.

30:12.958 --> 30:15.449
Web sites,
about the drug I mentioned,

30:16.061 --> 30:19.690
and an article on
family-to-family support groups.

30:24.002 --> 30:27.529
It's important for you to
know you're not alone, Robert.

30:27.939 --> 30:29.770
Wow. No one's ever...

30:34.412 --> 30:36.471
That's really nice of you to do.

30:36.548 --> 30:39.210
You didn't have to do that.
Thank you.

30:43.455 --> 30:46.652
You know, I found his body.
Ray Garnett.

30:48.693 --> 30:51.594
He asphyxiated himself
with carbon monoxide.

30:52.164 --> 30:53.597
That must have been awful.

30:53.665 --> 30:54.689
It was.

30:56.334 --> 31:00.464
A lot of the details were, you
know, left out of the media reports.

31:04.209 --> 31:05.699
So thoughtful.

31:08.713 --> 31:11.113
Oh, you have a meeting at 1:00?

31:11.183 --> 31:12.275
Yes.

31:14.920 --> 31:16.649
Let me help
you with that.

31:22.627 --> 31:23.821
Thanks.

31:54.859 --> 31:58.852
Your academy photo. These things
are almost impossible to get.

31:59.497 --> 32:01.931
It ran in the PBA
newsletter 12 years ago.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.797
She found a copy.

32:03.868 --> 32:06.200
This woman's got it bad for you.

32:08.273 --> 32:11.538
Yeah, but I'm not sure how
fixated she is on Ray Garnett.

32:12.577 --> 32:15.671
She had no interest in
the details of his death.

32:16.081 --> 32:19.312
You said that her
ex-husband was a fan?

32:20.051 --> 32:21.780
A devoted listener.

32:24.723 --> 32:30.958
With a devoted ex-wife who just
can't seem to let go of him.

32:35.100 --> 32:36.829
I'll pull his LUDs.

32:37.102 --> 32:40.299
She started calling Garnett's
show from her ex-husband's place

32:40.372 --> 32:42.863
one week after Garnett
was at her clinic.

32:42.941 --> 32:47.878
Each call coincided with the on-air calls
from the woman who called herself Susan.

32:48.546 --> 32:51.913
She indulged in sexual fantasies
while her husband listened

32:51.983 --> 32:53.951
from his commuter train.

32:54.619 --> 32:58.146
First prove Ms. Carlson switched
Mr. Garnett's medication.

32:58.223 --> 33:00.521
There's no evidence she
was even in his home.

33:00.592 --> 33:04.392
If she was in Garnett's house,
she wouldn't be able to resist

33:04.462 --> 33:10.992
taking a trophy to give to her ex-husband
as proof of her devotion to him.

33:11.636 --> 33:13.365
Then let's
ask Mr. Carlson.

33:13.438 --> 33:15.099
Well, he might not know.

33:16.441 --> 33:18.841
She hid this in my breast pocket.

33:20.745 --> 33:24.545
Now, I might not have noticed
it until I had my suit cleaned.

33:24.616 --> 33:29.952
But for her, simply knowing that it was
in my possession was satisfaction enough.

33:30.522 --> 33:34.322
If we ask Carlson and he doesn't
know, we could blow our chance.

33:34.392 --> 33:36.917
Then may I suggest a search warrant?

33:37.562 --> 33:41.555
Well, whatever the trophy is,
it's not gonna have his name on it.

33:42.467 --> 33:45.402
We're gonna have to
get her to point it out.

33:46.638 --> 33:49.436
You know, the phone
calls from his house,

33:49.941 --> 33:53.104
they implicate him as
much as they implicate her.

34:10.061 --> 34:11.187
Can I come in?

34:11.262 --> 34:12.752
Yes, of course, Robert.

34:13.465 --> 34:15.797
How did you know
where to find me?

34:15.867 --> 34:19.860
Your ex-husband told my partner
that you're here in the mornings.

34:20.572 --> 34:22.096
Why was she
talking to him?

34:22.172 --> 34:27.509
My partner convinced our boss that
Barry was obsessed with Garnett

34:29.347 --> 34:32.077
and that he's responsible
for his death.

34:32.183 --> 34:33.172
He was a fan, but...

34:33.251 --> 34:34.616
My partner traced calls

34:34.686 --> 34:40.386
from Barry's phone to
Garnett's radio station.

34:40.458 --> 34:41.482
Oh, my God.

34:41.559 --> 34:44.722
She's got a warrant.
She's on her way here.

34:45.295 --> 34:47.696
They can't do this to
my Barry. He's innocent.

34:47.766 --> 34:53.705
I know that Barry is important to you
and I want to help you protect him.

34:54.339 --> 34:58.036
Is there anything here that
can tie Barry to Garnett?

34:58.843 --> 35:00.242
No, I'm sure
there's nothing.

35:00.311 --> 35:03.610
They'll tear this place
apart. Now, you gotta think.

35:03.681 --> 35:07.117
'Cause if there's something
here that belongs to Garnett...

35:07.185 --> 35:08.584
If he did,
I would have seen it.

35:09.854 --> 35:13.654
This is the police. We have a
warrant to search the premises.

35:18.396 --> 35:20.455
Ms. Carlson,
is your ex-husband home?

35:20.532 --> 35:22.329
He left for work 15 minutes ago.

35:22.400 --> 35:24.834
This is a copy
of a warrant for...

35:25.003 --> 35:27.801
Yeah, I explained to
her why you're here.

35:28.206 --> 35:31.664
Good. Then later you can
explain to me why you're here.

35:31.743 --> 35:36.510
Nelly? I got a call from my
office the police were here?

35:36.581 --> 35:38.481
I left word
for them to notify you.

35:38.550 --> 35:39.744
What the hell is going on?

35:39.818 --> 35:41.547
It's all in here.

35:42.253 --> 35:44.778
Barry, you should go back to
work and I'll keep an eye on them.

35:44.856 --> 35:49.850
This is about Ray Garnett?
This is nuts. I'm staying put.

35:50.995 --> 35:54.362
If he stays, he'll get upset that
people are touching his things.

35:54.432 --> 35:57.333
All right, we don't want
any trouble, Mr. Carlson,

35:57.402 --> 35:58.869
so maybe you should
just wait outside...

35:58.937 --> 36:00.495
Mr. Carlson, since
you're on the premises,

36:00.572 --> 36:03.939
I'm gonna ask you to empty your
pockets and open your briefcase.

36:04.008 --> 36:05.032
What?
Yeah, why don't you just

36:05.109 --> 36:07.236
come over here,
Mr. Carlson?

36:07.445 --> 36:09.208
This is ridiculous.

36:22.193 --> 36:25.629
You know, you should hold on to your
keys, 'cause we don't want to lose those.

36:25.697 --> 36:29.292
You know, my partner says that
you were a huge fan of Ray Garnett.

36:29.868 --> 36:31.802
I listened to him.
In the mornings, right?

36:31.870 --> 36:34.805
In one of those cell
phone-free train cars?

36:35.707 --> 36:36.901
How did he put it?

36:36.975 --> 36:39.773
The only time he can
get away from Nelda.

36:40.111 --> 36:42.102
Well, that's not
a very nice thing to say.

36:42.180 --> 36:46.082
I mean, she makes your
lunch, cleans your house.

36:46.618 --> 36:48.313
Nelly's just being nice.

36:48.386 --> 36:52.550
Just being nice? I wish
that I could call her Nelly

36:52.624 --> 36:58.062
and evoke the feelings that she
has when she hears you say it.

37:00.465 --> 37:04.663
I mean, it's like a sweet glue
that holds her together, you know?

37:06.004 --> 37:09.371
You know, knowing that you eat the
food that she prepares and you sleep

37:09.440 --> 37:12.034
in the sheets
that she irons for you.

37:21.419 --> 37:25.719
You know, without that
connection, she disintegrates.

37:26.658 --> 37:28.023
Nelly knows
we're just friends.

37:28.092 --> 37:30.117
You sure about that?

37:30.762 --> 37:32.229
Why do you think we're here?

37:32.297 --> 37:35.892
These calls were made from your
phone to Ray Garnett's radio show.

37:36.701 --> 37:39.135
Hundreds of calls
over five months.

37:39.203 --> 37:42.138
I didn't make these calls.
I was on a train.

37:44.008 --> 37:48.069
Nelly?
Why were you calling him?

37:49.180 --> 37:51.148
That only time when you
can get away from her,

37:51.215 --> 37:53.809
she found another way to be with you.

37:57.655 --> 38:01.250
<i>The young men, they pretend
that they're taking notes,</i>

38:01.326 --> 38:03.988
<i>but I caught them looking at me.</i>

38:05.063 --> 38:07.224
<i>All they think about
is sex.</i>

38:07.298 --> 38:09.926
<i>Well, that's all
I think about, Susan.</i>

38:10.702 --> 38:13.398
<i>I might as well be
naked in that class.</i>

38:13.938 --> 38:15.530
<i>Would you like
to be naked?</i>

38:15.607 --> 38:20.374
<i>With all those guys around?
And those hot college chicks?</i>

38:20.445 --> 38:22.242
<i>Be naked with them?</i>

38:22.313 --> 38:25.248
<i>I think...
I think I would.</i>

38:27.018 --> 38:31.751
Oh, my God. That girl Susan,
that was you on the phone?

38:31.823 --> 38:33.586
Live from your bed,
probably.

38:33.658 --> 38:36.092
Barry, don't...
Please, don't.

38:36.928 --> 38:39.658
Come on, don't look
so disgusted, Barry.

38:41.666 --> 38:43.964
You didn't
enjoy her fantasies?

38:44.569 --> 38:48.505
You know, her demonstrations,
her unchained devotion to you?

38:48.573 --> 38:52.509
Well, it made the long hours
without you more bearable.

38:52.577 --> 38:55.375
And then Garnett's station
started screening his calls,

38:55.446 --> 38:58.279
and Nelda couldn't
get on the air anymore.

39:05.556 --> 39:07.319
Garnett cut you off.

39:12.530 --> 39:15.055
And he got in between
you and Barry.

39:17.335 --> 39:19.826
You could hardly
catch your breath.

39:23.307 --> 39:25.537
You started to fall apart.

39:31.949 --> 39:33.712
And you got enraged.

39:36.487 --> 39:39.513
And you had to punish him.
And you knew exactly how,

39:39.590 --> 39:41.080
because you're
a prescribing nurse

39:41.159 --> 39:45.619
and you have access to all
kinds of drugs and placebos...

39:45.697 --> 39:46.755
Robert, stop this.

39:46.831 --> 39:48.230
You bullied the maid,

39:48.299 --> 39:49.766
got into the home,
you switched the pills.

39:49.834 --> 39:51.563
You can't think
I'm capable of that.

39:51.636 --> 39:55.697
You're as capable as your
obsession is profound.

39:57.475 --> 39:58.942
You waited for
the maid to tell you

39:59.010 --> 40:03.276
that he was starting to try
and buy painkillers again.

40:04.282 --> 40:07.843
And that's when you knew that
his spiral was almost complete,

40:07.919 --> 40:09.784
his suicide was imminent.

40:09.854 --> 40:12.186
You went to his place,
switched back his pills,

40:12.256 --> 40:16.420
so the autopsy would show he'd
been taking his anti-depressants.

40:16.494 --> 40:17.893
She's lying.

40:21.466 --> 40:22.660
Is she?

40:29.373 --> 40:31.341
The embroidery
on the key chain.

40:31.409 --> 40:34.276
You know,
I have something like that.

40:36.447 --> 40:39.439
Nelda made this for me.
She make that for you?

40:40.985 --> 40:43.476
Yeah, she gave it to me last month.

40:43.554 --> 40:45.681
You ever look at it
closely?

40:46.958 --> 40:52.396
You see, entwined into the
weave, that black, shiny thread?

40:55.666 --> 40:58.658
Well, actually, it's
not thread. It's hair.

41:01.439 --> 41:02.929
Long, human hair.

41:03.007 --> 41:06.568
I'll bet a DNA test will show
they belong to Ray Garnett.

41:07.378 --> 41:08.436
What?

41:08.513 --> 41:10.913
She made a special
memento for you.

41:10.982 --> 41:17.615
A keepsake, to commemorate
her visit to your idol's home.

41:18.322 --> 41:23.419
Yes, I did it. But I got the hairs
from the clinic when he stayed there.

41:23.494 --> 41:26.088
I knew how much
you enjoyed his show.

41:26.898 --> 41:31.267
I wanted you to have something of
his, something that no one else had.

41:31.903 --> 41:35.600
So you got the hair from the
clinic when Garnett was there,

41:35.907 --> 41:37.966
detoxing from his
addiction to painkillers?

41:38.042 --> 41:39.134
Yes.

41:42.980 --> 41:48.316
So if we test the hair, it should
show traces of the painkiller.

41:52.323 --> 41:54.188
But it won't, will it?

41:56.761 --> 41:59.059
Robert,
why are you doing this?

42:00.231 --> 42:02.426
I thought you
cared about me.

42:06.437 --> 42:08.530
You're under arrest,
Nelda.

42:08.773 --> 42:12.675
You said you knew, you knew
how important Barry is to me.

42:12.743 --> 42:16.372
I just wanted to be connected
to him, that's why I did it.

42:16.447 --> 42:18.972
I thought you liked
Susan's stories.

42:22.420 --> 42:25.014
Why couldn't you
just leave me alone?

42:25.323 --> 42:29.259
Don't say that.
Let me go!

42:29.560 --> 42:34.896
I have to be with him!
No. Robert, please.

42:35.933 --> 42:37.901
How can you be so cruel?

42:38.236 --> 42:40.431
Don't take me
away from him.

42:40.972 --> 42:42.303
Hey, come on...

42:42.373 --> 42:43.601
Don't you care
about me at all?

42:43.674 --> 42:45.642
I know you do, I saw it.

42:47.311 --> 42:49.643
I didn't mean
for you to see it.

42:56.754 --> 42:59.780
No! No, Barry!

43:01.359 --> 43:05.728
Don't leave me!
Please don't leave me!

43:07.365 --> 43:08.889
Don't leave me!
