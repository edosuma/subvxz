00:35.530 --> 00:36.691
Alright, boys.

00:36.771 --> 00:38.592
That's enough for this school group.

00:38.672 --> 00:40.261
Shouldn't we finish the routine?

00:40.824 --> 00:42.637
Always leave them wanting more.

00:43.687 --> 00:46.218
The penguin is native to Antarctica.

00:46.528 --> 00:49.634
Did you know, a group of penguin is called a rookery.

00:50.010 --> 00:52.574
It's a bird but it doesn't fly.

00:52.935 --> 00:56.242
Did you know penguins can swim 15 miles an hour?

00:56.322 --> 00:59.063
Keep an eye on Johnny smart glasses.

00:59.143 --> 01:01.203
The boy knows too much.

01:05.203 --> 01:05.916
Not yet.

01:06.231 --> 01:08.822
I want to know where he gets his intel.

01:08.902 --> 01:11.545
Did you know the only way to tell boy penguins

01:11.625 --> 01:14.605
from girl penguins is a DNA test, huh?

01:14.685 --> 01:15.991
Nevermind, boys.

01:16.071 --> 01:17.388
The kid is off his wing nut.

01:18.104 --> 01:19.908
Like we need some dna test

01:19.988 --> 01:23.242
to tell us we're 100% antarctic macho.

01:24.698 --> 01:25.688
Listen, kid.

01:25.768 --> 01:28.748
All I know is we've got three males and a female.

01:28.828 --> 01:30.914
The birds know which is which?

01:41.871 --> 01:42.932
Loogy hockey.

01:43.100 --> 01:45.443
That's how a real man gives a DNA sample.

01:45.523 --> 01:46.861
Am I right?

01:46.941 --> 01:49.585
That's Alice, she doesn't know what she's talking about.

01:50.363 --> 01:51.574
Clearly.

01:51.884 --> 01:52.600
But don't worry.

01:52.680 --> 01:55.621
This DNA analyzer will establish once and for all

01:55.701 --> 01:58.336
our macho manly man machismo.

02:01.838 --> 02:02.457
Plus.

02:02.537 --> 02:04.013
That's a male result for Rico.

02:09.347 --> 02:10.019
Plus.

02:10.336 --> 02:11.655
Private is a male too.

02:13.519 --> 02:14.819
I am also a plus.

02:15.208 --> 02:16.066
Obviously.

02:16.906 --> 02:18.710
And a ??? plus sign for me.

02:18.790 --> 02:20.010
Well, that's that.

02:22.371 --> 02:22.919
What?

02:23.313 --> 02:26.425
You have never seen a plus sign so large and manly?

02:28.374 --> 02:30.302
How about... that local sports team?

02:30.382 --> 02:31.876
Stand down, Kowalski.

02:31.956 --> 02:32.840
Let me...

02:32.920 --> 02:33.662
No, Skipper.

02:33.742 --> 02:34.794
Get off, ???

02:36.200 --> 02:37.031
Minus?

02:37.749 --> 02:38.519
Skipper...

02:38.890 --> 02:40.694
It appears, Alice was right.

02:40.959 --> 02:42.931
We do have one female and...

02:43.400 --> 02:44.010
It's you.

02:46.672 --> 02:47.264
Sorry.

02:47.344 --> 02:47.771
No.

02:48.284 --> 02:48.903
Wrong.

02:49.354 --> 02:50.504
Double wrong.

02:50.584 --> 02:53.272
Wrong infinity. There's no way I'm a female.

02:53.471 --> 02:56.318
Alright, what you're experiencing are the five stages of grief.

02:56.398 --> 02:58.273
Right now you're in stage one: denial.

02:58.353 --> 02:59.157
I am not.

02:59.360 --> 03:02.367
All I'm saying is your stupid machine is wrong.

03:02.447 --> 03:03.936
Well, it's based on scientific

03:04.016 --> 03:05.183
And science is wrong.

03:05.263 --> 03:06.176
And you're wrong.

03:06.256 --> 03:07.856
Everybody is wrong but me.

03:07.936 --> 03:09.681
I demand a different test.

03:09.761 --> 03:11.874
I'm not sure it's going to be as accurate as

03:12.122 --> 03:13.811
Just do it, man.

03:14.757 --> 03:15.906
Take your time, Skipper.

03:15.986 --> 03:18.332
There's no right or... wrong answer.

03:26.676 --> 03:27.304
Madam?

03:27.578 --> 03:28.542
Lies!

03:30.488 --> 03:32.813
I see we're in stage two, anger.

03:33.936 --> 03:35.802
Next we should see bargaining.

03:36.268 --> 03:36.754
Private.

03:36.957 --> 03:39.310
How's about we trade DNA results? Come on.

03:39.390 --> 03:40.813
Skipper, I don't think that's help.

03:40.893 --> 03:41.520
Depression.

03:41.600 --> 03:43.457
My life is over.

03:43.537 --> 03:44.642
It's over.

03:44.943 --> 03:46.676
It's over, over, over.

03:46.756 --> 03:48.138
And finally acceptance.

03:48.218 --> 03:50.234
Well, I guess you have to play the hand you're dealt.

03:50.314 --> 03:52.444
Rico, hit me with a pretty pink bow.

03:54.301 --> 03:55.955
Let's move out, gentlemen.

03:56.035 --> 03:57.122
But... you're

03:57.202 --> 03:58.141
Sure.

03:58.221 --> 04:00.237
We moved past that, Kowalski.

04:00.317 --> 04:02.748
This doesn't change a thing about our operation.

04:02.828 --> 04:03.685
Now come on.

04:03.765 --> 04:05.622
We have a full mission schedule.

04:07.718 --> 04:08.390
All right.

04:08.470 --> 04:09.734
We'll start with an easy one.

04:09.814 --> 04:13.183
??? simian ??? gonna ??? habitat draining system.

04:09.814 --> 04:13.183
Let's start with the drain clog.

04:13.263 --> 04:14.536
Rico, demolition.

04:23.004 --> 04:25.843
Recover stelen zoovenirs shop merchandise from sewer rats.

04:25.923 --> 04:26.497
Check.

04:26.577 --> 04:28.425
Now a hasty escape and

04:29.324 --> 04:30.615
Skipper, what are you doing?

04:30.924 --> 04:31.862
Come on.

04:31.942 --> 04:33.224
Lady, door.

04:33.304 --> 04:35.019
What, is chivalry dead?

04:39.995 --> 04:41.498
What's the holdup?

04:41.578 --> 04:42.648
Hang in there, Skipper.

04:42.728 --> 04:45.247
I'm sure the zoo must have a ladies room somewhere.

04:45.327 --> 04:47.909
I just never really paid attention before.

04:47.989 --> 04:50.619
You know, we can just stop and ask for directions.

04:51.406 --> 04:52.909
What is happening to me?

04:52.989 --> 04:56.278
Curse you, DNA!

04:56.520 --> 04:57.422
Maurice.

04:57.502 --> 05:00.394
Why is that penguin wearing a pretty pink bow on his head

05:00.474 --> 05:02.428
and shouting at the sky spirits?

05:02.508 --> 05:04.019
And also I have a follow-up,

05:04.341 --> 05:06.835
How come I don't have a pretty pink bow?

05:08.343 --> 05:10.491
Okay I am bored for a question already

05:10.571 --> 05:11.958
like where is my smoothe?

05:12.038 --> 05:13.036
It's coming, your hinest.

05:13.116 --> 05:15.486
Looks like we just got to give the blender a second ???

05:15.566 --> 05:17.122
The second is too slow.

05:19.058 --> 05:21.747
Okay, not working.
Let us move to plan H.

05:21.827 --> 05:23.540
Don't you mean plan B?

05:23.620 --> 05:27.563
No-no, plans b through g are much too ridiculously dangerous.

05:28.677 --> 05:29.668
Plan H...

05:29.748 --> 05:33.341
Is that Mort goes down to the under the ground electrically power cables

05:33.421 --> 05:36.702
and doesn't come out until the smoothe machine works again.

05:36.782 --> 05:38.293
I like plan H.

05:39.807 --> 05:40.877
Good, Mort.

05:41.063 --> 05:43.371
Now start pulling things out of other things

05:43.451 --> 05:45.334
and put them into new things.

05:45.414 --> 05:47.430
I'm sure it will work itself out.

05:47.510 --> 05:48.305
Okay.

05:53.492 --> 05:54.508
In light of...

05:55.570 --> 05:56.472
events.

05:56.675 --> 05:59.805
I feel I can no longer serve in this unit.

06:00.495 --> 06:01.777
Well, I don't...

06:01.857 --> 06:02.449
No...

06:03.307 --> 06:05.111
Yes, actually, probably, sure.

06:06.119 --> 06:06.491
Ya.

06:06.995 --> 06:08.755
But, Skipper, where will  you go?

06:08.835 --> 06:11.310
On an epic quest, old friend.

06:11.390 --> 06:13.551
??? out of here, I confused.

06:13.631 --> 06:15.293
Naive little girl.

06:15.479 --> 06:18.379
And I'm not coming back until I ??? learn to be a real women.

06:19.877 --> 06:23.335
So I think we start with the basic princess theory

06:23.415 --> 06:26.067
Then after that fine art of eyelash batting.

06:26.147 --> 06:26.831
I'm sorry.

06:26.999 --> 06:28.723
You're a girl?

06:28.803 --> 06:31.385
Open your mind, sister. I'm here for help.

06:32.101 --> 06:33.454
Being a girl...

06:33.534 --> 06:36.553
which... I guess... you are...

06:36.633 --> 06:37.313
Exactly.

06:37.782 --> 06:39.958
Exactly I need you to teach me all the girly stuff

06:40.038 --> 06:42.336
You know, like makeovers and poodle skirts.

06:44.279 --> 06:45.366
That's your idea of girl stuff?

06:45.446 --> 06:45.897
What?

06:46.083 --> 06:47.940
It's more about lip gloss these days?

06:48.020 --> 06:50.230
Big problemo, sister, I got no lips.

06:50.310 --> 06:51.831
Skipper, if you're girl, then...

06:51.911 --> 06:52.998
girl stuff is...

06:53.338 --> 06:54.664
whatever you like doing.

06:54.744 --> 06:57.927
If you're in to the commando thing being a girl doesn't change that.

06:58.007 --> 06:59.033
Of course not.

06:59.113 --> 07:00.845
It just means now I'm not good at it.

07:01.013 --> 07:03.224
Now, pass me some chiffon, dollface.

07:03.378 --> 07:06.110
I got a hankering to sew me some curtains.

07:09.347 --> 07:10.594
Shouldn't you be looking into that?

07:10.674 --> 07:12.530
Land sakes, no.

07:12.731 --> 07:14.756
That sounded dangerous.

07:14.836 --> 07:17.834
How about we stay here and gossip about boys.

07:18.709 --> 07:20.416
Hey, that's no way to treat a lady.

07:23.400 --> 07:24.488
Save the king!

07:24.568 --> 07:25.841
The others are optional.

07:26.044 --> 07:27.945
Oh, sparkly.

07:28.980 --> 07:31.129
??? live electrical wires.

07:31.209 --> 07:34.560
5000 bolts of shear mortal danger.

07:36.186 --> 07:37.459
Hang on, your majesty.

07:38.343 --> 07:40.413
Oh, now how is that even possible?

07:40.784 --> 07:43.472
Those lemurs are in trouble and there is no one else here to save them.

07:43.645 --> 07:46.899
So, what are you going to do about it, girlfriend?

07:49.426 --> 07:50.823
I... I should, but...

07:51.389 --> 07:52.963
girl... cant...

07:53.043 --> 07:54.873
It's all right, ladies.

07:55.121 --> 07:56.615
We have got this one

07:56.695 --> 07:59.100
Oh, well, if the boys are already taking care of it...

07:59.180 --> 08:01.452
Come on sister, let's make pink lemonade.

08:01.532 --> 08:03.469
They will be thirsty after a good rescue.

08:06.484 --> 08:07.342
Wait.

08:07.642 --> 08:09.897
What if Marlene's ??? is right?

08:09.977 --> 08:12.294
Those lemurs need a organized rescue team.

08:12.609 --> 08:14.245
And the team needs a Skipper.

08:14.608 --> 08:17.473
Maybe... Just maybe...

08:21.507 --> 08:22.869
Don't worry, girls.

08:23.293 --> 08:25.548
Everything is still under control.

08:25.964 --> 08:27.564
??? trouble

08:27.706 --> 08:29.598
danger growing,

08:29.788 --> 08:32.698
commando mojo returning.

08:32.778 --> 08:34.448
My butt frying.

08:35.428 --> 08:38.063
Come on, Skipper, you can still do this.

08:38.143 --> 08:40.389
It's time to show those guys

08:40.469 --> 08:42.856
what girls are really made of.

08:43.924 --> 08:45.613
Pretty pink bow.

09:04.737 --> 09:08.107
there is something... different about that one.

09:18.071 --> 09:20.238
That... That was...

09:20.318 --> 09:23.138
One hundred percent girl awesome!

09:24.102 --> 09:26.207
You know what, it really was!

09:26.287 --> 09:27.777
Up high, sister.

09:29.201 --> 09:30.784
Eh, skipper.

09:30.864 --> 09:33.950
We don't quite know how to say this, but, wel...

09:34.253 --> 09:38.250
even as a female you're still the machoest manly man I know.

09:39.276 --> 09:41.549
I would be honored to take orders from a girl.

09:41.717 --> 09:43.512
The honor is all mine, boys.

09:43.828 --> 09:45.384
Okay, very touching.

09:45.464 --> 09:47.489
But none of this fixes my smoothe maker.

09:49.638 --> 09:50.973
Why are you so powerless?

09:51.053 --> 09:52.184
Powerless, uh?

09:52.264 --> 09:54.484
Something must have overloaded the circuit.

09:54.674 --> 09:57.168
What could have drawn so much electricity that

09:57.451 --> 09:58.344
Of course.

10:00.130 --> 10:01.704
A blown fuse.

10:01.784 --> 10:04.322
Well, let's just swap that out and...

10:06.248 --> 10:07.937
Just as I suspected.

10:08.017 --> 10:10.449
The DNA analyzer was a power hog.

10:11.130 --> 10:14.030
I knew I shouldn't have included the optional beak shiner.

10:17.877 --> 10:19.160
Skipper, look.

10:20.539 --> 10:24.174
The female minus was really an unfinished male plus.

10:24.254 --> 10:25.986
What violence and mayhem.

10:26.282 --> 10:28.033
I'm a real boy after all.

10:28.113 --> 10:28.979
Yes!

10:29.059 --> 10:30.465
Well done, yes.

10:31.579 --> 10:33.038
Alright, alright.

10:33.118 --> 10:33.825
Thank you.

10:34.191 --> 10:37.764
But I would like to think we've all learned a valuable lesson today.

10:37.844 --> 10:39.090
Boy, girl...

10:39.250 --> 10:41.354
All that really matters is...

10:41.434 --> 10:44.656
how well you use a pink bow whip in a crisis situation.

10:44.736 --> 10:47.910
Oh wait. It's I don't think that was really the lesson, I...

10:49.682 --> 10:53.334
But how could Alice have been so wrong about there being a girl penguin?

10:53.414 --> 10:55.244
Ah, she's a mammal.

10:55.324 --> 10:57.526
Everyone knows they are all morons.

10:58.039 --> 10:58.604
What!

10:58.684 --> 11:00.090
We'll work on that one tomorrow.
