WEBVTT

00:02.269 --> 00:05.470
- Previously on<i> The Strain...</i>
- Was that my mom?

00:05.472 --> 00:07.838
(snarling)

00:09.641 --> 00:11.374
- I'm not letting you get
in my way again!

00:11.376 --> 00:13.142
(screams)

00:13.144 --> 00:14.943
- I found a way to kill
these things, it's a bioweapon.

00:14.945 --> 00:16.778
It needs to be refined
but it works.

00:16.780 --> 00:18.813
I have a great contact
at Kemerall.

00:18.815 --> 00:21.882
- What did he tell you
about me?

00:21.884 --> 00:24.317
(screaming)
Oh, shit!

00:24.319 --> 00:27.053
(silenced shots)
- No, please!

00:27.055 --> 00:29.722
<i> - He's been five steps</i>
<i> ahead of us</i>

00:29.724 --> 00:32.057
this entire time,
from the plane right till now.

00:32.059 --> 00:36.461
- What are you gonna do? - I'm
going to kill Eldritch Palmer.

00:38.398 --> 00:41.766
(opera playing)

00:45.671 --> 00:48.905
- I've studied your photographs,

00:48.907 --> 00:53.075
think I can do you justice.

00:53.077 --> 00:56.578
Is this your color?

01:00.150 --> 01:02.049
The Master has released

01:02.051 --> 01:05.919
his will enough for you
to find yourself in him --

01:05.921 --> 01:09.088
your thoughts, your memories,

01:09.090 --> 01:13.692
your voice. Answer me.
(soft clicking)

01:13.694 --> 01:17.095
Is this your color?
- Yes.

01:17.097 --> 01:19.664
- Good.

01:19.666 --> 01:22.767
Your voice...
(purring sound)

01:22.769 --> 01:25.736
You will feel it
along with him,

01:25.738 --> 01:29.172
like tinnitus

01:29.174 --> 01:32.341
or two speakers
badly aligned.

01:32.343 --> 01:35.677
But they will tune in,

01:35.679 --> 01:37.679
and the ability
to speak fluently

01:37.681 --> 01:39.747
will become second nature.

01:41.684 --> 01:44.284
Your tissues are still firm.

01:44.286 --> 01:46.786
The soft ones will go first.

01:46.788 --> 01:48.788
Your nose is losing

01:48.790 --> 01:53.626
vascularity, but it will
remain for months.

01:55.563 --> 01:58.463
(sighing)
Ha!

01:58.465 --> 02:00.631
(Kelly moaning softly)

02:00.633 --> 02:03.533
We'll match the neck piece
to this.

02:03.535 --> 02:05.868
Soon you'll be

02:05.870 --> 02:08.370
doing this yourself.

02:13.876 --> 02:16.877
You must learn to control
these contractions.

02:16.879 --> 02:19.045
- It's...difficult.

02:19.047 --> 02:23.315
- It feels unnatural, I know,
but you can dominate the urge.

02:26.753 --> 02:30.054
<i> Ausgezeichneti.</i>

02:30.056 --> 02:33.757
Now, we mustn't forget the eyes.

02:33.759 --> 02:36.392
They are, after all,

02:36.394 --> 02:39.228
the windows to the soul.

02:50.573 --> 02:54.107
- See? I was correct.

02:54.109 --> 02:58.910
This is the mother our dear Zack
cries for in the night.

02:58.912 --> 03:02.146
(croaking)

03:05.618 --> 03:07.985
(theme music playing)

03:23.936 --> 03:26.503
- (Fet): I assume you haven't
told Nora?

03:26.505 --> 03:29.305
- (Eph): Oh, no. She'd have
1,000 reasons why it was

03:29.307 --> 03:32.441
a stupid idea.
- And she'd be right.

03:32.443 --> 03:34.876
No stupider than helping

03:34.878 --> 03:38.346
the old man find a book with a
magic spell to kill the Master.

03:41.617 --> 03:44.284
- Medication for that
bullet wound?

03:44.286 --> 03:46.953
- Breakfast.

03:46.955 --> 03:48.955
So you tried going through
Palmer's front door,

03:48.957 --> 03:50.957
that didn't work out so well.
I figure my best shot

03:50.959 --> 03:52.892
is to nail him from a distance.

03:52.894 --> 03:55.728
- Sniper his ass?
- Mm-hmm.

03:57.665 --> 04:00.332
- It might work. Pity we don't
have a rifle, though.

04:00.334 --> 04:01.833
- I was hoping
you'd know somebody

04:01.835 --> 04:03.835
who could hook me up
with that.

04:03.837 --> 04:05.837
You know, it's New York.

04:05.839 --> 04:07.839
You want something like that,
you need to know a guy.

04:07.841 --> 04:10.474
- All right.

04:10.476 --> 04:13.710
Go see this guy Jimmy Wu.

04:13.712 --> 04:15.878
Boat repair place
along the Erie Basin.

04:15.880 --> 04:18.413
Yeah, at least in the front.
In the back,

04:18.415 --> 04:21.182
he's a little more diversified,
if you know what I mean.

04:21.184 --> 04:24.385
<i>...allowing official government</i>
<i> or police vehicles through.</i>

04:24.387 --> 04:26.453
(sirens wailing,
gunshots firing)

04:35.764 --> 04:37.163
- Good morning.

04:37.165 --> 04:39.165
- How are you?

04:39.167 --> 04:41.233
- Wonderful.

04:42.336 --> 04:46.104
I feel so safe here with you.

04:46.106 --> 04:49.607
Haven't felt that way
in a long time.

04:49.609 --> 04:52.676
- Wish we could
just stay here.

04:52.678 --> 04:56.679
- Why not? I could cancel
the Cardinal

04:56.681 --> 04:58.881
this morning.

04:58.883 --> 05:02.417
- No, don't do that.

05:04.854 --> 05:07.120
- I take it he found that book.

05:07.122 --> 05:09.255
What is it anyway?

05:09.257 --> 05:12.124
- An ancient text,
only one of its kind.

05:12.126 --> 05:15.961
It purportedly chronicles myths
in pre-Christian Europe.

05:15.963 --> 05:18.463
- Didn't think you'd be
interested in that

05:18.465 --> 05:22.633
sort of thing.
- Which one?

05:22.635 --> 05:25.969
What else is on
the agenda for today?

05:25.971 --> 05:28.705
-<i> Herr Eichorst</i>
in the afternoon.

05:28.707 --> 05:31.874
I know he's important to you,
but I can't stand that man.

05:31.876 --> 05:34.977
- I need him.
Doesn't mean I like him.

05:34.979 --> 05:37.579
- Have you noticed
he smells funny?

05:37.581 --> 05:40.882
Like rotten fish?
- Let's not talk about him.

05:40.884 --> 05:43.384
- You said he
does things for you.

05:43.386 --> 05:45.386
What sort of things?

05:45.388 --> 05:47.554
- You don't need to know.
- Yes, I do.

05:47.556 --> 05:51.224
I'm a big girl, Eldritch.
Whatever it is, I can handle it.

05:51.226 --> 05:54.093
I can't be an asset to you
if you keep me in the dark.

05:54.095 --> 05:56.161
- You are an asset.

05:56.163 --> 05:59.297
But this is one area
I can't talk about.

06:03.769 --> 06:06.069
- Don't you trust me?
- This is not about trust.

06:06.071 --> 06:09.238
I'm trying to protect you.
- From what?

06:09.240 --> 06:11.907
- I'm doing everything in my
power to save this city,

06:11.909 --> 06:15.610
but there are forces out there
working just as hard

06:15.612 --> 06:17.612
to make sure I fail.
The truth is,

06:17.614 --> 06:20.448
when you're dealing with
a cruel and ruthless enemy--

06:20.450 --> 06:24.184
- You need people on your team
who can be just as ruthless.

06:24.186 --> 06:27.754
I get it. But...
- What?

06:27.756 --> 06:30.923
- I see the way he talks to you,
and how much you hate it.

06:30.925 --> 06:34.626
Why him? How is he helping you?
If I knew more,

06:34.628 --> 06:36.427
I could help you more.
- I appreciate that, Coco,

06:36.429 --> 06:39.596
more than you know.
The way I grew up...

06:39.598 --> 06:41.598
It's hard for me
to talk about this.

06:41.600 --> 06:43.866
- Just...

06:43.868 --> 06:46.969
Just trust me.

06:46.971 --> 06:49.638
I'm on your side.

06:49.640 --> 06:52.440
- Be patient.

06:52.442 --> 06:55.176
Give me some time.

07:01.517 --> 07:03.617
- (TV host):<i> It's three minutes</i>
<i> past the hour,</i>

07:03.619 --> 07:05.619
<i> time for the</i>
<i> Accuweather forecast...</i>

07:05.621 --> 07:08.455
(drawers shuffling)
- You're going out?

07:08.457 --> 07:10.623
- Oh, sorry, I didn't mean
to wake you.

07:10.625 --> 07:14.159
I'm taking Zack
on some errands.

07:14.161 --> 07:16.628
- Did you hear
about Barnes?

07:16.630 --> 07:19.297
It's been all over
the news.

07:19.299 --> 07:22.566
Apparently, he fell off
a train.

07:22.568 --> 07:26.069
The same 1:30 train
that you were on to DC.

07:26.071 --> 07:28.971
They found his body
outside of Baltimore.

07:28.973 --> 07:32.341
Did you see him?
- No, I didn't.

07:32.343 --> 07:36.478
- And you didn't hear anything
or notice...

07:36.480 --> 07:39.547
- No.

07:39.549 --> 07:41.982
I'll see you.

07:41.984 --> 07:45.085
- When are we going
to talk about

07:45.087 --> 07:47.387
exactly what happened
down there?

07:47.389 --> 07:50.323
- I don't know what there is
to talk about.

07:50.325 --> 07:52.658
I shouldn't have gone
when I did.

07:52.660 --> 07:55.494
You were right. I was wrong.

07:55.496 --> 07:59.498
- (scoffing): OK--
- OK. See ya.

08:02.536 --> 08:05.270
(helicopter blades whirring)
(police radios chattering)

08:11.011 --> 08:13.845
- (whistles)
Councilwoman Faraldo's

08:13.847 --> 08:16.848
taking care of business, huh?
A couple more days, she'll have

08:16.850 --> 08:19.851
all of Red Hook sealed off.
- Admirable, but at best

08:19.853 --> 08:22.787
only a holding action.

08:22.789 --> 08:25.122
We should have set off earlier.

08:25.124 --> 08:27.390
He's a busy man.
If we're late,

08:27.392 --> 08:29.392
he's liable to cancel
the appointment.

08:29.394 --> 08:32.361
- Yeah, I forgot that blowing
those transit tunnels would

08:32.363 --> 08:36.631
play hell with the traffic.
- I thought Dutch

08:36.633 --> 08:40.368
was coming along.
- No. Her friend Nikki,

08:40.370 --> 08:42.636
she's uncomfortable
staying with us,

08:42.638 --> 08:45.405
so, uh, Dutch is helping her
find a place

08:45.407 --> 08:47.573
in one of the buildings
we cleared.

08:47.575 --> 08:50.242
- Mr. Fet, get your head

08:50.244 --> 08:52.244
out of her skirt
and back in the game.

08:52.246 --> 08:55.146
You need to be focused up here.

08:55.148 --> 08:58.215
- No, don't....
Don't you worry.

09:01.053 --> 09:03.787
(police siren wailing)
- So, how you doing, Zack?

09:03.789 --> 09:06.256
You've been pretty quiet
this morning.

09:06.258 --> 09:08.391
- I had a dream
about Mom last night.

09:08.393 --> 09:10.393
- Oh, yeah?
What kind of dream?

09:10.395 --> 09:14.796
- I went back to the house and
she was there in the kitchen.

09:14.798 --> 09:17.732
I asked her where she'd been.

09:17.734 --> 09:19.967
She said,
"I've been here all along,

09:19.969 --> 09:22.803
waiting for you."

09:22.805 --> 09:25.572
She looked so normal.

09:25.574 --> 09:28.675
She made spaghetti,

09:28.677 --> 09:30.743
garlic bread...
- Your favorite.

09:32.680 --> 09:34.980
- It was so real.
When she hugged me,

09:34.982 --> 09:37.615
I could smell her hair.

09:37.617 --> 09:41.418
(sighing)

09:41.420 --> 09:42.852
- You do understand
that wasn't your mother

09:42.854 --> 09:45.921
who showed up
at the church, right?

09:45.923 --> 09:48.623
Your mother is dead.

09:48.625 --> 09:51.292
That creature took over
her body.

09:51.294 --> 09:53.527
Her one goal is to turn you.

09:53.529 --> 09:56.596
- You don't know that.
- Yes, I do! And after

09:56.598 --> 09:59.998
everything you've seen,
so should you.

10:02.435 --> 10:05.103
- What was that?
- I don't know. Come on.

10:15.214 --> 10:18.048
- What's that smell?

10:18.050 --> 10:20.950
- Gunpowder.

10:22.920 --> 10:25.120
- Hello?

10:26.323 --> 10:29.457
- Whoa... Careful with
that thing.

10:35.164 --> 10:37.164
- We're closed.

10:37.166 --> 10:41.101
Go.
- We saw somebody running away.

10:41.103 --> 10:43.770
What happened? Are you hurt?
- No!

10:43.772 --> 10:47.306
- My dad's a doctor.

10:59.419 --> 11:01.819
- (woman): Pa, he's a doctor.

11:01.821 --> 11:04.922
- Jimmy Wu? I'm a friend
of Vasiliy Fet.

11:04.924 --> 11:07.891
(moaning softly)
Let me see.

11:11.428 --> 11:15.096
(groaning)

11:15.098 --> 11:18.199
- This is a serious injury.
What happened?

11:18.201 --> 11:20.634
- A guy came in,
a guy that we know.

11:20.636 --> 11:22.936
A guy that we thought we knew
and he...

11:22.938 --> 11:26.172
He wanted to deal, so...

11:26.174 --> 11:28.207
We have a lot
of side businesses.

11:28.209 --> 11:31.276
- Looks like the slug went
right through. That's good.

11:31.278 --> 11:33.611
What's not so good is the damage
it may have done on the way.

11:33.613 --> 11:35.946
- He's losing a lot of blood!
- I'm not a surgeon!

11:35.948 --> 11:38.315
This isn't what I do.

11:38.317 --> 11:42.619
But with no hospitals up and
running... - Can you help him?

11:42.621 --> 11:46.055
Please!
- There isn't much I can do

11:46.057 --> 11:48.624
without a surgical kit.
- Oh, we have those.

11:48.626 --> 11:51.159
They're a really popular item
for people who can't go

11:51.161 --> 11:53.194
to the hospitals --
like gang members.

11:56.566 --> 11:59.466
Can you save him?

12:05.473 --> 12:07.539
- I'm gonna try.

12:15.148 --> 12:18.249
- So, who is this
mysterious seller,

12:18.251 --> 12:20.251
and how did he acquire it?

12:20.253 --> 12:22.253
- I promised to protect
his anonymity.

12:22.255 --> 12:25.256
Given the book's history, he is
concerned about his safety.

12:25.258 --> 12:28.492
- How much does
he want for it?

12:28.494 --> 12:30.660
- Well, it is one of his most
prized possessions.

12:30.662 --> 12:33.996
It's terrifically painful
for him to part with--

12:33.998 --> 12:36.365
- Skip the soft shoe
and give me a number.

12:36.367 --> 12:38.900
(pauses typing)

12:38.902 --> 12:41.202
- Tell me what you're
willing to pay.

12:41.204 --> 12:44.772
- $200,000.

12:44.774 --> 12:47.941
- I don't think that's going to get it done.
- Half a million.

12:47.943 --> 12:51.177
- Well, you really

12:51.179 --> 12:53.946
want this book.
- In cash. Today.

12:53.948 --> 12:56.281
- In gold.
- Done.

12:56.283 --> 12:59.516
- There are other
interested parties.

13:01.286 --> 13:05.554
- Who?

13:05.556 --> 13:07.622
- Is one of them
Abraham Setrakian?

13:09.525 --> 13:13.126
The man's not a serious player.
He's wasting your time.

13:13.128 --> 13:15.728
- I appreciate the advice.
- Name a figure that will

13:15.730 --> 13:18.697
close the deal right now.
- I can't, not as long

13:18.699 --> 13:21.066
there are other bidders.
- (slamming table): Don't play

13:21.068 --> 13:23.201
games with me, Paul!
You'll regret it.

13:23.203 --> 13:27.037
- I can attest to that.

13:27.039 --> 13:29.706
- And who is this gentleman?

13:29.708 --> 13:33.709
- An associate. He's helping me
with the Freedom Centers.

13:36.647 --> 13:40.448
- I'll be in touch.

13:44.286 --> 13:46.552
- Now, what could His Eminence

13:46.554 --> 13:49.154
possibly have
that would be worth

13:49.156 --> 13:51.256
half a million dollars to you?

13:51.258 --> 13:54.559
- How dare you barge
in here unannounced!

13:54.561 --> 13:56.561
- You haven't answered
the question.

13:56.563 --> 13:59.296
- Because it's none
of your damn business!

14:01.233 --> 14:04.334
- Everything that transpires
in this office

14:04.336 --> 14:06.336
is my business.

14:06.338 --> 14:08.905
- Coco, will you give us
some privacy?

14:08.907 --> 14:11.007
- Are you sure?

14:11.009 --> 14:12.375
- Yes!

14:16.513 --> 14:19.280
- Poor dear.

14:19.282 --> 14:22.683
I believe you hurt her feelings.
(door closing)

14:22.685 --> 14:24.751
- I won't be micromanaged.

14:24.753 --> 14:27.253
If you continue to scrutinize
my every move,

14:27.255 --> 14:30.789
I won't make our timetable.
And if I fail,

14:30.791 --> 14:34.125
you fail and your Master
will be displeased.

14:34.127 --> 14:36.460
- We don't want you
to fail, Eldritch.

14:36.462 --> 14:41.097
We are all on the same team.
Though, speaking of timetables,

14:41.099 --> 14:44.033
when will our facility
be back on track?

14:44.035 --> 14:46.035
- Fortunately, the sabotage
was inept. It should only

14:46.037 --> 14:48.437
take a couple of weeks
to repair.

14:48.439 --> 14:52.840
- You have one week.
Not a day more.

14:54.643 --> 14:59.645
- By the way, I haven't seen
your man Bolivar lately.

14:59.647 --> 15:02.347
I hope nothing's
happened to him.

15:04.451 --> 15:07.952
- Bolivar has a new assignment.
- Really?

15:07.954 --> 15:11.955
Doing what?
- The Master has chosen him

15:11.957 --> 15:14.023
as his new vessel.

15:16.127 --> 15:19.461
- Well! Imagine that!

15:19.463 --> 15:22.130
I always assumed
he would pick someone

15:22.132 --> 15:24.799
with a distinguished record
of loyal service --

15:24.801 --> 15:26.801
like you.

15:26.803 --> 15:29.637
Instead, he selects

15:29.639 --> 15:32.806
a washed-up pop star?

15:32.808 --> 15:35.241
It boggles the mind.

15:35.243 --> 15:38.310
- A narrow mind
is easily boggled.

15:38.312 --> 15:42.714
- Well, it's not for us
to question.

15:42.716 --> 15:45.817
The Master does
or does not.

15:45.819 --> 15:48.219
In this case he did,

15:48.221 --> 15:50.487
but not with you.

15:50.489 --> 15:52.989
- It matters not to me.

15:52.991 --> 15:56.258
I only live to serve him.

15:56.260 --> 15:58.493
- Of course you do.

15:58.495 --> 16:01.496
So, when I see
Bolivar again,

16:01.498 --> 16:05.332
what's the protocol?
Do I get down on my knees?

16:05.334 --> 16:07.834
Kiss his ring?

16:07.836 --> 16:10.736
What do you do?

16:27.554 --> 16:29.720
- Chundo, coriander,

16:29.722 --> 16:31.722
vindaloo,

16:31.724 --> 16:36.025
An-ar-darana seeds...

16:36.027 --> 16:38.961
(speaking Spanish)

17:31.915 --> 17:34.181
- Oh, shit!

17:56.471 --> 17:58.537
- Take a look at that, huh?

17:58.539 --> 18:00.639
19th century,

18:00.641 --> 18:02.941
15,000 square feet

18:02.943 --> 18:05.944
of neo-Gothic perfection.
Oof!

18:05.946 --> 18:09.113
Cardinal's doing all right
for himself, huh?

18:09.115 --> 18:12.516
Huh?
(sirens passing)

18:17.955 --> 18:21.456
- You're late.
- My apologies, Your Eminence.

18:21.458 --> 18:25.193
- Not necessary, Nicholas.
They won't be staying long.

18:30.666 --> 18:32.666
- I'm listening.

18:32.668 --> 18:37.703
- My clients wish to purchase
the<i> Occido Lumen.</i>

18:40.374 --> 18:44.141
- The<i> Lumen</i> is an exceedingly
valuable artifact.

18:46.645 --> 18:49.312
And forgive me for saying so,
but you two do not appear

18:49.314 --> 18:51.647
to have the resources
to enter the game.

18:51.649 --> 18:56.250
- We don't,
but our clients do.

18:56.252 --> 18:59.152
- And who are these "clients"?
- Not important.

18:59.154 --> 19:01.854
All you need to know
is they can meet your price.

19:01.856 --> 19:04.323
- Is that so?

19:04.325 --> 19:06.491
Well, the price is now

19:06.493 --> 19:10.194
$750,000 in gold.

19:10.196 --> 19:13.597
- Agreed. I can have it to you

19:13.599 --> 19:16.433
within 24 hours.

19:20.872 --> 19:23.238
- I'll be in touch.

19:25.242 --> 19:27.442
- You have another bidder.

19:27.444 --> 19:31.112
Is it Eldritch Palmer?

19:31.114 --> 19:34.849
I must warn you, you're dealing
with a very dangerous man.

19:34.851 --> 19:38.686
- He probably has people
watching your every move.

19:38.688 --> 19:41.555
- Your position
will not protect you.

19:41.557 --> 19:43.557
- Duly noted.

19:43.559 --> 19:46.693
And I'm moved by your concern
for my personal safety.

19:46.695 --> 19:48.795
But if you gentlemen
will excuse me,

19:48.797 --> 19:50.062
the mayor has requested
I deliver an address

19:50.064 --> 19:51.630
at his fund-raiser tonight,

19:51.632 --> 19:54.132
and I've yet to write
word one of my speech.

19:54.134 --> 19:57.568
- When will we hear from you?
- Check back tomorrow afternoon.

19:57.570 --> 19:59.937
Nicholas, escort them out.

20:11.216 --> 20:13.216
(door closing)

20:13.218 --> 20:15.218
(shouting and car horns)
- So how are we gonna

20:15.220 --> 20:18.387
get our hands on 750 grand
in gold?

20:18.389 --> 20:21.423
- That is not our concern
right now.

20:21.425 --> 20:24.826
If this man has the<i> Lumen,</i>
Palmer will take it from him.

20:24.828 --> 20:28.229
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
How are we gonna stop him?

20:28.231 --> 20:30.296
- We're going
to take it first.

20:33.167 --> 20:35.400
- Rob a cardinal?

20:35.402 --> 20:39.670
- I prefer to think of it as
recovering a stolen artifact,

20:39.672 --> 20:42.606
but yes, we're going to rob
the son of a bitch.

20:42.608 --> 20:45.342
(helicopter passing)

20:45.344 --> 20:48.411
(giggling)

20:55.286 --> 20:57.419
- Get some gauze
and get ready to wipe.

21:02.459 --> 21:04.559
- There's going to be a lot of
blood. You might not

21:04.561 --> 21:07.962
want to watch this.
- I'm fine.

21:07.964 --> 21:09.730
- You, too, buddy.

21:09.732 --> 21:11.865
You don't have to be here
if you don't want to be.

21:11.867 --> 21:15.535
- I think I'll be OK. - OK.
You've been doing great so far.

21:26.480 --> 21:29.614
OK, wipe.

21:33.218 --> 21:37.220
(cars honking)

21:45.629 --> 21:48.062
- (stiffly):
What's going on, Officer?

21:48.064 --> 21:50.064
- Quarantine inspection, miss.

21:50.066 --> 21:52.566
Would you mind taking off
your sunglasses?

21:54.503 --> 21:58.838
- Red Hook is...
under quarantine?

22:04.511 --> 22:07.578
(humming)
What is that light for?

22:07.580 --> 22:09.580
- Some people,
they don't know

22:09.582 --> 22:12.583
they're infected,
but UV light

22:12.585 --> 22:15.018
shows the goddamn worms
right under the skin.

22:15.020 --> 22:18.087
Would you pop
your trunk, please?

22:18.089 --> 22:21.022
(gasping slightly)

22:23.426 --> 22:27.027
- STINGERS! WE'VE GOT STINGERS!!
- TAKE THEM OUT!

22:27.029 --> 22:29.429
- Drive on! Go, go, go!
Drive on! Move! Move!

22:29.431 --> 22:32.932
(screeching)
(guns firing)

22:32.934 --> 22:36.702
(croaking and growling)

23:08.168 --> 23:10.801
(hissing and croaking)

23:10.803 --> 23:14.037
(croaking and purring)

23:29.487 --> 23:32.154
(staples clicking)

23:32.156 --> 23:34.922
- OK, Zack, pull the wheel back
and stop the blood flow.

23:37.092 --> 23:40.660
- I tried to repair all the
damage. It's a miracle there was

23:40.662 --> 23:43.329
no GI involvement. Mr. Wu,
on a scale of 1 to 10,

23:43.331 --> 23:46.165
10 being unendurable, how would
you rate your pain?

23:46.167 --> 23:48.500
- (weakly): 15.

23:48.502 --> 23:52.170
- Do you have any pain meds?

23:55.841 --> 23:58.407
OK, that'll do.

24:01.378 --> 24:03.277
OK, here we go. Meperidine.

24:03.279 --> 24:05.578
Give him two of these
every four hours.

24:07.682 --> 24:09.848
- Mr. Wu, you're a very lucky
man. I'll leave the post-op

24:09.850 --> 24:12.684
instructions for your daughter.
- Hey, Pa...

24:12.686 --> 24:16.854
(speaking Chinese)

24:16.856 --> 24:20.023
- Pay him. Pay the man.

24:20.025 --> 24:22.025
- Oh, no, no, no. I actually
came here to buy something.

24:22.027 --> 24:25.695
- Oh... Take it.

24:25.697 --> 24:29.031
Whatever you want.
Medical supplies?

24:29.033 --> 24:32.034
- Not exactly.

24:32.036 --> 24:34.969
- So, why do you
want a rifle?

24:37.206 --> 24:39.539
- For protection.

24:39.541 --> 24:42.542
- Against Mom?

24:42.544 --> 24:44.577
- If it comes to that.

24:44.579 --> 24:47.212
Hey, Zack, I want you to know,

24:47.214 --> 24:49.814
I couldn't have done that
back there without you.

24:49.816 --> 24:52.049
- It was gross,

24:52.051 --> 24:54.384
but kinda cool.

24:54.386 --> 24:58.053
- You know, I performed my first
procedure when I was 14.

24:58.055 --> 25:00.789
High school biology.

25:00.791 --> 25:02.957
We dissected bullfrogs.

25:02.959 --> 25:05.492
The captain of the football
team, he passed out.

25:05.494 --> 25:08.228
But I was fascinated to see what
was inside a living organism.

25:08.230 --> 25:10.730
I think that's when I decided
to become a doctor.

25:10.732 --> 25:13.799
- Well, maybe you could
try to save Mom

25:13.801 --> 25:15.901
the same way you saved Mr. Wu.

25:15.903 --> 25:20.338
Or at least talk to her first.
- Zack--

25:20.340 --> 25:22.673
- Mr. Setrakian said that
sunlight would destroy

25:22.675 --> 25:24.675
the Master.
He was wrong about that,

25:24.677 --> 25:28.178
so maybe he's wrong
about her, too.

25:38.088 --> 25:41.322
(croaking)

25:46.461 --> 25:50.329
(child chirping and croaking)

25:59.939 --> 26:02.873
- (man): Forget it. No.
We are not going anywhere.

26:02.875 --> 26:05.942
We've been through hard times
before. This will pass.

26:05.944 --> 26:09.679
- No, this isn't some temporary
economic downturn, Dad.

26:09.681 --> 26:12.882
- If you guys stay,
you're gonna die.

26:12.884 --> 26:16.151
- All of you.
- He's right, Mr. Gupta.

26:16.153 --> 26:20.655
Everywhere we went, places were
wrecked. Looted. Burned.

26:20.657 --> 26:23.624
- 26 years we put into this
place, built it from nothing.

26:23.626 --> 26:25.626
- If you did it once,
you can do it again --

26:25.628 --> 26:28.228
someplace safe.
- What about the quarantine?

26:28.230 --> 26:30.230
Nobody gets papers
to leave the city unless

26:30.232 --> 26:33.032
they work for the government.
- We'll find a way.

26:33.034 --> 26:35.034
Our people have been crossing
borders without permission

26:35.036 --> 26:38.170
since Texas was Mexico.<i> Sí o no?</i>

26:38.172 --> 26:42.173
- When we left Amritsar,
we were just as desperate.

26:42.175 --> 26:44.542
Please, Naren.

26:51.183 --> 26:53.183
(speaks word in other language)
- OK.

26:53.185 --> 26:55.151
- Good. I'll go look
at the road blocks,

26:55.153 --> 26:57.086
find a spot for the car
to cross.

26:57.088 --> 27:01.423
In the meantime, you guys pack
light in case we have to walk.

27:04.694 --> 27:07.161
- Gus, wait!

27:07.163 --> 27:09.496
- Thank you.

27:09.498 --> 27:11.564
You know, for all your help.

27:13.834 --> 27:16.701
Will you come with us?

27:16.703 --> 27:20.504
- You want me to?

27:32.217 --> 27:35.184
- Augustin Elizalde!

27:39.022 --> 27:40.321
We need to talk.

27:48.197 --> 27:51.264
- It's OK. What do you want?

27:53.201 --> 27:56.302
- Are you frightened, Gus?
- I'm smart.

27:56.304 --> 27:59.371
Smart enough to be careful.
- Smart enough to be

27:59.373 --> 28:02.206
the only one to walk out
of Stoneheart alive.

28:04.810 --> 28:09.745
- I don't care who you are,
where you're from or what

28:09.747 --> 28:11.747
you're selling, but if you don't
get away from here, I'm gonna

28:11.749 --> 28:14.382
put a bullet in your head.
- If you were going to shoot me,

28:14.384 --> 28:16.450
you would have done so already.

28:18.487 --> 28:21.054
- It's OK, baby! It's OK, baby!
(stranger growling)

28:21.056 --> 28:24.791
- Shall we invite her
to join us?

28:31.332 --> 28:34.566
- Vaun trained you.
Did he ever mention

28:34.568 --> 28:36.768
who trained him?

28:36.770 --> 28:39.070
- Nah, he didn't
mention nothing.

28:39.072 --> 28:42.840
- A good soldier, but he
underestimated the Master.

28:47.612 --> 28:51.780
My name is Quinlan.

28:51.782 --> 28:54.783
- Well, hi, Quinlan.

28:54.785 --> 28:57.118
But like I said,

28:57.120 --> 28:59.353
I don't work
for those fools anymore.

28:59.355 --> 29:01.855
- The Ancients?

29:01.857 --> 29:05.458
Fools they are, indeed.

29:05.460 --> 29:08.594
I don't work for them either --
I'm merely

29:08.596 --> 29:12.097
using them to get what I want.
- Which is?

29:12.099 --> 29:15.666
- The Master.
- Oh.

29:15.668 --> 29:17.768
Oh, cool.

29:17.770 --> 29:20.036
Well, best of luck to you.

29:20.038 --> 29:22.371
No, seriously, Godspeed.

29:22.373 --> 29:24.439
Give me my gun back.

29:27.143 --> 29:29.476
- His shadow looms over you.

29:29.478 --> 29:31.978
You crossed him
and he does not forget.

29:31.980 --> 29:34.313
What has it cost you
thus far?

29:34.315 --> 29:36.948
Your best friend?

29:36.950 --> 29:41.452
Your mother?
Do you not see a pattern?

29:47.392 --> 29:50.259
- She's very beautiful.

29:52.830 --> 29:55.664
Beauty and love
are fleeting but powerful.

29:55.666 --> 30:00.568
I've known both.
I've lost both.

30:03.139 --> 30:05.405
You can save her, Gus,

30:05.407 --> 30:11.343
but the only way
is to give her up--

30:11.345 --> 30:13.711
until we slay the Master,
that is.

30:16.682 --> 30:18.848
- I don't get it, man.

30:18.850 --> 30:22.452
Why? Why me? Why me?

30:22.454 --> 30:24.787
- That is a question I learned
to stop asking myself

30:24.789 --> 30:26.855
many centuries ago.

30:41.304 --> 30:43.870
- Nicholas,
bring the car around.

30:46.774 --> 30:49.608
- Nicholas?
- It seems like such an odd way

30:49.610 --> 30:53.945
for a father to express
his love for his only son.

30:53.947 --> 30:56.447
Don't you agree?

30:56.449 --> 30:59.283
- How the hell
did you get in here?

30:59.285 --> 31:01.985
- Uh, Nicholas let me in.

31:01.987 --> 31:05.388
Oh, I'm here for
the<i> Occido Lumen.</i>

31:05.390 --> 31:07.990
- I don't know what you're
talking about.

31:07.992 --> 31:10.659
- Oh, I think you do. Eldritch
is hardly a man of faith.

31:10.661 --> 31:14.629
I doubt he would
offer you $500,000

31:14.631 --> 31:18.565
for some arcane
religious texts.

31:18.567 --> 31:22.802
- Hmm... Suppose I did
have the<i> Lumen.</i>

31:22.804 --> 31:26.305
Why would that interest you?

31:26.307 --> 31:28.807
- My client is most eager
to acquire it.

31:28.809 --> 31:31.042
- I hope he has deep pockets.

31:31.044 --> 31:33.077
The current price
is one million.

31:33.079 --> 31:36.346
- I have a better offer.
- Hmm! Let's hear it.

31:36.348 --> 31:39.548
- Your life.

31:41.585 --> 31:44.485
- You need to leave my house.
Get the hell out!

31:44.487 --> 31:46.987
NICHOLAS!
- Nicholas is indisposed.

31:58.066 --> 32:01.333
(bolts rattling)

32:01.335 --> 32:03.568
(wood crunching)

32:08.507 --> 32:11.007
<i> - Crux Sancta Sit Mihi Lux!</i>

32:11.009 --> 32:13.042
<i> Non Draco Sit Mihi Dux.</i>

32:13.044 --> 32:15.344
<i> Vade Retro, Satana!</i>

32:15.346 --> 32:18.613
- Do you hear him, Lord?
Your faithful servant

32:18.615 --> 32:20.915
beseeches you
in his hour of need.

32:20.917 --> 32:23.017
Won't you come to his aid?

32:23.019 --> 32:27.253
Unleash a thunderbolt
to strike down his tormentor?

32:29.390 --> 32:31.790
Hmm...

32:31.792 --> 32:35.193
It appears your Almighty
has better things to do.

32:35.195 --> 32:37.195
(cardinal breathing heavily)

32:37.197 --> 32:41.365
Now, one last time.

32:41.367 --> 32:45.202
Where is the<i> Lumen?</i>

32:45.204 --> 32:48.405
- I don't have it!
I was selling it for someone.

32:48.407 --> 32:50.974
- Who? Where can I find
this person?

32:50.976 --> 32:55.377
- I can't say! I swore before
God I would never tell.

32:55.379 --> 32:58.046
(sighing)
- Well,

32:58.048 --> 33:01.382
we wouldn't want you
to break that vow.

33:01.384 --> 33:05.786
(croaking)
(gasping)

33:15.630 --> 33:18.764
(thud)
- No!

33:18.766 --> 33:21.833
- Can you feel the worms
burrowing through your flesh?

33:21.835 --> 33:23.901
When they have finished,
you will have

33:23.903 --> 33:26.103
no secrets from the Master,

33:26.105 --> 33:30.673
the true Almighty.
He will learn who has the<i> Lumen.</i>

33:30.675 --> 33:33.308
(groaning)

33:33.310 --> 33:35.910
Now, now, don't look so gloomy.

33:35.912 --> 33:38.679
Soon you will meet your new

33:38.681 --> 33:40.247
Lord--

33:42.251 --> 33:45.986
(sword swishing)
(growling)

33:56.932 --> 34:00.099
- He was telling the truth.

34:00.101 --> 34:02.101
Once the worms turn you,
the Master

34:02.103 --> 34:05.437
will read your thoughts
and the<i> Lumen</i> will be his.

34:05.439 --> 34:08.940
But there is a higher power
watching us right now,

34:08.942 --> 34:11.275
and he wants you to stop

34:11.277 --> 34:13.443
the evil that has cast
its shadow over this city.

34:13.445 --> 34:15.611
- How?

34:15.613 --> 34:19.447
- Tell me who has the book.
It's our only hope. Tell me, and

34:19.449 --> 34:21.449
I will release your soul to God

34:21.451 --> 34:24.884
before the forces of vile
darkness take it from you.

34:27.221 --> 34:29.788
- Rudyard

34:29.790 --> 34:31.956
Fonescu.

34:31.958 --> 34:35.459
- Of course.

34:35.461 --> 34:40.530
The boy from the convent
in Austria.

34:45.002 --> 34:49.037
May God have mercy on your soul.

34:55.144 --> 34:57.878
- Holy Christ!
-<i> ...the cardinal's body</i>

34:57.880 --> 34:59.212
<i> was brutally mutilated.</i>

34:59.214 --> 35:01.147
<i> Signs of forced entry</i>
<i> were discovered...</i>

35:01.149 --> 35:03.048
- What's wrong?
-<i> ...but there is no evidence</i>

35:03.050 --> 35:05.984
<i> that valuables were taken from</i>
<i> the residence. A second body</i>

35:05.986 --> 35:08.319
<i> also found</i> --
- Oh, my God!

35:08.321 --> 35:10.754
Who would do such a thing?

35:10.756 --> 35:15.325
Could it be because
of that book?

35:15.327 --> 35:18.094
Eldritch,
you're obviously upset.

35:18.096 --> 35:19.995
If you tell me what
this is all about--

35:19.997 --> 35:22.364
- I don't want you involved!
- Do you think Eichorst

35:22.366 --> 35:24.499
had something to do with this?
- Coco, please!

35:24.501 --> 35:27.502
- I can't help you if--
- This is NOT your concern!

35:27.504 --> 35:31.538
Do you understand?
- Yes,

35:31.540 --> 35:33.740
very clearly.

35:33.742 --> 35:37.043
- Coco? What are you doing?

35:37.045 --> 35:39.879
Coco, where are you going?
Coco, please!

35:39.881 --> 35:43.015
- I gave you every chance.
You want to keep your secrets

35:43.017 --> 35:45.017
to yourself, then that's exactly
what will happen.

35:45.019 --> 35:49.187
(door slams)

35:51.124 --> 35:53.424
(loud knocking)

36:00.866 --> 36:03.700
- What are you doing with that?
- Thought it might come

36:03.702 --> 36:07.437
in handy.
- Hey, Zack. You hungry?

36:14.112 --> 36:16.178
- What's that all about?

36:28.158 --> 36:30.591
- He's still in denial about
Kelly. We keep having the same

36:30.593 --> 36:33.393
circular argument.
- I wonder why. Think about it,

36:33.395 --> 36:36.429
Eph. You've sent him mixed
messages since day one.

36:36.431 --> 36:38.431
First, you shield him
from the truth.

36:38.433 --> 36:40.433
Then you rubbed his face in it.

36:40.435 --> 36:42.768
Then you take off to Washington
and leave him here with me.

36:42.770 --> 36:44.903
- You told me to do that!

36:44.905 --> 36:47.906
- Because I couldn't
stop you from going!

36:47.908 --> 36:50.775
Zack wanted you to stay.

36:50.777 --> 36:53.077
And yet you never
even called him.

36:53.079 --> 36:56.946
Not once. It's your
responsibility as a father

36:56.948 --> 36:59.615
to check in.
(low purring)

36:59.617 --> 37:02.284
God knows why you couldn't
find the time.

37:02.286 --> 37:06.087
(more purring)
- What's that supposed to mean?

37:06.089 --> 37:08.756
- You're hiding something.

37:08.758 --> 37:11.425
I can see it in your eyes.

37:14.596 --> 37:17.496
(video game sounds)

37:28.308 --> 37:30.941
(grunt)

37:40.485 --> 37:43.452
- All right, you want to know
what happened in DC? Fine.

37:43.454 --> 37:46.288
Let's start with the train.
I did see Barnes.

37:46.290 --> 37:49.824
He saw me. I wanted
to get off at Baltimore,

37:49.826 --> 37:54.494
we got into a fight and I'm
the one that threw him off.

37:54.496 --> 37:58.897
- Why didn't you tell me?

37:58.899 --> 38:00.999
- I don't know. Maybe it has
something to do with the fact

38:01.001 --> 38:03.368
that I went down there to save
the human race, and all

38:03.370 --> 38:06.904
I managed to do was get
four people killed.

38:06.906 --> 38:09.239
- Four? Barnes?
- Rob,

38:09.241 --> 38:12.141
the man that was sent
to kill us...

38:12.143 --> 38:13.575
- Who was the fourth?

38:16.313 --> 38:18.813
- Leigh Thomas.

38:18.815 --> 38:21.982
She was a pharmaceutical rep.

38:21.984 --> 38:26.218
The hit man shot her
and she bled out in my arms.

38:28.155 --> 38:31.055
- I see.

38:51.343 --> 38:56.378
(purring)

38:56.380 --> 38:58.446
(video game sounds)

39:03.518 --> 39:05.751
(tapping)

39:10.891 --> 39:13.191
- (distorted): Zack.

39:13.193 --> 39:16.127
- Mom?

39:24.403 --> 39:28.404
- I've missed you so much.
(croaking softly)

39:28.406 --> 39:32.040
- I've missed you, too.

39:32.042 --> 39:34.742
- Please, honey, let me in.

39:34.744 --> 39:37.878
There is so much
I have to tell you.

39:37.880 --> 39:40.146
- But...

39:40.148 --> 39:42.748
I can't.

39:42.750 --> 39:44.883
You're...

39:44.885 --> 39:47.986
- Look at me.

39:47.988 --> 39:50.989
You can see that
that's not true.

39:50.991 --> 39:54.058
I was sick,

39:54.060 --> 39:57.627
very sick,
but I'm getting better.

39:58.796 --> 40:01.430
Just let me in

40:01.432 --> 40:04.565
and I'll explain everything.

40:07.169 --> 40:10.436
- Thank you for telling me.

40:10.438 --> 40:14.105
- (Zack): I can't!

40:14.107 --> 40:16.841
- Did you hear something?

40:16.843 --> 40:19.176
Zack?
(quick gasp)

40:19.178 --> 40:22.179
- I'm so cold, Z.
Just let me in

40:22.181 --> 40:24.681
and we can work this out
together, OK?

40:24.683 --> 40:27.350
- Zack, you all right?
(croaking)

40:27.352 --> 40:30.186
NO! DON'T!
- You were wrong, Dad.

40:30.188 --> 40:33.355
Look at her. She needs our help.

40:33.357 --> 40:35.756
- Don't let her in!

40:38.360 --> 40:40.693
(growl)

40:40.695 --> 40:42.961
(ricocheting shots)

40:57.076 --> 41:01.945
- (Kelly): Eph, give him to me.

41:05.383 --> 41:09.218
You never wanted him anyway.

41:09.220 --> 41:12.754
Let's let Zack decide
who he wants to be with.

41:12.756 --> 41:16.791
I wonder who he'll choose.

41:20.729 --> 41:23.062
Zack? Honey?

41:23.064 --> 41:25.164
- Stay there!
(growling)

41:25.166 --> 41:27.900
- Come to me.
- Kelly, where are you?

41:27.902 --> 41:29.568
(snarling)

41:29.570 --> 41:33.138
Come on out. You wanna talk?
Let's talk.

41:40.079 --> 41:42.245
- Nora! Watch out!
(loud slurping and screeching)

41:48.519 --> 41:50.885
(squealing)

41:52.989 --> 41:54.488
- Eph!

42:29.457 --> 42:31.657
(yelling)

42:31.659 --> 42:33.825
- No, get off of him!
Leave him alone!

42:33.827 --> 42:36.794
(grunting)
No, stop!

42:36.796 --> 42:39.396
(growling)

42:42.000 --> 42:45.801
(hissing)
Please stop!

42:55.812 --> 42:57.978
- Zack?

43:06.921 --> 43:09.221
(breathing heavily)

43:20.667 --> 43:23.901
