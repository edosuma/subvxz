WEBVTT

00:01.349 --> 00:02.350
- Previously on
"God Friended Me"...

00:02.393 --> 00:03.481
- I got a good friend,

00:03.525 --> 00:04.961
teaches marketing over at Harlem College.

00:05.005 --> 00:06.615
You should take his class.

00:06.658 --> 00:09.618
- You're DJ Trek?
- I also go by Nia.

00:09.661 --> 00:11.141
[cell phone buzzes]
- It's Eli.

00:11.185 --> 00:12.664
- You gonna give him
another shot?

00:12.708 --> 00:16.451
- I don't know.
Not sure what to do.

00:16.494 --> 00:19.541
- The Blue Danube
has a house band.

00:19.584 --> 00:21.673
We could meet here
and walk over.

00:21.717 --> 00:23.675
- Yes.
[laughs]

00:23.719 --> 00:25.590
- That's the piece of the
God Account code I sent you.

00:25.634 --> 00:27.549
- You want to find Falken?
Post it on the internet,

00:27.592 --> 00:29.768
lure him out of whatever hole
he's been hiding in.

00:29.812 --> 00:31.640
- Make him come to us.

00:34.295 --> 00:36.036
- New York City,

00:36.079 --> 00:39.039
the most diverse city
in the world,

00:39.082 --> 00:41.041
but in a time where
technology and faith

00:41.084 --> 00:44.522
have collided instead of
providing a way for us

00:44.566 --> 00:47.395
to share our ideas
and our beliefs,

00:47.438 --> 00:51.051
we're left feeling
more disconnected than ever.

00:51.094 --> 00:54.228
That's why my podcast
is so relevant.

00:54.271 --> 00:58.058
The Millennial Prophet
is a podcast destination

00:58.101 --> 01:00.886
for those looking to bridge
the divide

01:00.930 --> 01:04.281
between believer
and non-believer.

01:04.325 --> 01:06.892
[applause]
- Thank you, Miles.

01:06.936 --> 01:11.027
Your assignment this week is
to perfect your elevator pitch.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.811
Now turn to the person next
to you,

01:12.855 --> 01:14.074
and this is your new partner.

01:14.117 --> 01:15.597
I want you to familiarize
yourself

01:15.640 --> 01:18.556
with each other's products
and give productive feedback.

01:18.600 --> 01:22.169
See you next week.

01:22.212 --> 01:25.302
- Hi, partner.
[chuckles]

01:25.346 --> 01:28.784
I'll send you a link
to my podcast

01:28.827 --> 01:30.960
so you can listen to a few
episodes before we meet.

01:31.003 --> 01:33.310
- Oh, I've already listened.
I like it.

01:33.354 --> 01:35.312
You've a voice, Miles.
I think it's gonna catch on.

01:35.356 --> 01:37.314
- Wow, thanks.

01:37.358 --> 01:40.187
- I did have one question about
your podcast.

01:40.230 --> 01:42.493
This God Account
you talk about,

01:42.537 --> 01:43.842
is that for real?

01:43.886 --> 01:46.541
- The account, yes.
God, no.

01:46.584 --> 01:49.021
- So when you get
a Friend Suggestion,

01:49.065 --> 01:51.328
you have to figure out
how to help them?

01:51.372 --> 01:53.069
- Yeah, and it's not easy.

01:53.113 --> 01:55.202
[cell phone buzzes]

01:55.245 --> 01:58.335
Here we go.

01:58.379 --> 01:59.554
- Wait.

01:59.597 --> 02:01.164
Are you messing with me?

02:01.208 --> 02:02.557
- No, they send me
a Friend Suggestion

02:02.600 --> 02:04.167
when I'm talking about them,

02:04.211 --> 02:05.951
they're probably
listening to us right now.

02:05.995 --> 02:07.605
- Yeah, it's 2018,

02:07.649 --> 02:09.172
our phones are listening
to all of us.

02:09.216 --> 02:11.174
- [laughs]

02:11.218 --> 02:13.307
- So how are you going to find
this Blair Lewis?

02:13.350 --> 02:15.178
- I have no clue.
[elevator bell dings]

02:15.222 --> 02:17.267
Excuse me,
can you hold the elevator?

02:21.663 --> 02:23.404
Thanks.

02:25.101 --> 02:27.277
- No worries.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.281
- Having a good day?

02:31.325 --> 02:34.589
- For a human beach ball,
it's as good as it gets.

02:34.632 --> 02:36.025
You?

02:36.068 --> 02:38.462
- So far, so good.
- All right.

02:38.506 --> 02:40.638
[mechanical shuddering]

02:40.682 --> 02:42.901
- I take that back.
- What's happening?

02:42.945 --> 02:44.468
- I think the elevator stalled.

02:44.512 --> 02:47.776
It's okay.
I'll call security.

02:47.819 --> 02:49.212
I think it's broken.

02:49.256 --> 02:51.388
- We're stuck and nobody knows
we're in here.

02:51.432 --> 02:52.998
We got to get out of here now.

02:53.042 --> 02:56.219
- Don't worry, I'll call 911.

02:56.263 --> 02:57.438
But there's no service.

02:57.481 --> 02:59.831
- Hey. Hey!
We're stuck in here!

02:59.875 --> 03:02.269
Can someone please call
the fire department?

03:02.312 --> 03:06.229
- [heavy breathing]

03:06.273 --> 03:08.231
My doctor told me
not to put myself

03:08.275 --> 03:09.928
in stressful situations.

03:09.972 --> 03:12.322
It can induce labor,
and my baby is breech.

03:12.366 --> 03:14.281
I can only deliver
by c-section.

03:14.324 --> 03:16.239
- Oh, okay.
Look at me.

03:16.283 --> 03:18.415
Look at me. Look at me.
Look at me,

03:18.459 --> 03:20.287
My name is Miles.
This is Nia,

03:20.330 --> 03:22.158
and we're here with you.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.116
It's gonna be okay.

03:24.160 --> 03:25.248
- I'm Blair.

03:25.292 --> 03:27.424
- So have you picked
a name yet?

03:27.468 --> 03:31.820
- No, I'm hoping I'll be
inspired when he arrives.

03:31.863 --> 03:34.649
- My--my mom didn't have a
name before I was born either.

03:34.692 --> 03:36.433
She said that

03:36.477 --> 03:40.132
a name is a mother's
first gift to her child,

03:40.176 --> 03:43.614
so she wanted it to have
a very special meaning.

03:43.658 --> 03:46.443
So when I was born,
my mother looked at me

03:46.487 --> 03:48.271
and saw the face of my father

03:48.315 --> 03:51.187
and she saw the face
of her father,

03:51.231 --> 03:54.321
both of whom marched
on Washington and Selma

03:54.364 --> 03:56.236
for equality.

03:56.279 --> 03:58.586
My mother never wanted me
to forget

03:58.629 --> 04:02.154
the miles and miles that
my father and my grandfather

04:02.198 --> 04:05.332
walked for my Civil Rights.

04:05.375 --> 04:08.509
- That's beautiful, Miles.

04:09.988 --> 04:11.729
- You okay?

04:11.773 --> 04:14.036
- I think I am.

04:14.079 --> 04:15.429
[elevator bell dings]

04:15.472 --> 04:18.083
Oh, thank God.

04:18.127 --> 04:20.434
[sighs]

04:24.873 --> 04:26.440
Who knows what would
have happened

04:26.483 --> 04:28.616
if you two hadn't been there
to talk me down?

04:28.659 --> 04:31.619
Thank you, guys.
I owe you one.

04:31.662 --> 04:32.663
- I'm glad we could help.

04:32.707 --> 04:34.883
- You sure did.

04:34.926 --> 04:36.406
[both laughing]

04:36.450 --> 04:40.758
Thank you, Miles.
Thank you, Nia.

04:40.802 --> 04:42.412
- Talk about
a great elevator pitch.

04:42.456 --> 04:44.371
You knew exactly
how to help her.

04:44.414 --> 04:47.199
So that's it?
Just on to the next one?

04:47.243 --> 04:48.853
- Usually I'll get another
Friend Suggestion

04:48.897 --> 04:50.638
to let me know that my work
here is done.

04:50.681 --> 04:52.292
[cell phone buzzes]

04:52.335 --> 04:54.772
- Um...

04:54.816 --> 04:58.515
kind of like this.

04:58.559 --> 05:01.257
But it usually doesn't
happen this fast.

05:01.301 --> 05:04.260
- Well, Miles, looks like
you're gonna have a busy day.

05:11.093 --> 05:12.703
- Morning.

05:21.059 --> 05:23.497
- Morning.

05:25.412 --> 05:27.327
[cell phone buzzes]

05:30.068 --> 05:31.853
- What?

05:31.896 --> 05:34.290
- I have to meet someone
about a story.

05:34.334 --> 05:37.075
- Let me guess.
Miles?

05:37.119 --> 05:38.686
- Great guess.

05:38.729 --> 05:42.820
- Have you told him
we're dating?

05:42.864 --> 05:44.387
- No.

05:44.431 --> 05:47.390
I mean, this just happened.

05:47.434 --> 05:49.218
Miles and I are just friends,

05:49.261 --> 05:52.264
but you're right.
I should tell him.

05:55.398 --> 05:57.357
- We send out a piece of
the God Account's code

05:57.400 --> 05:59.228
hoping to lure out Falken,

05:59.271 --> 06:02.405
and instead we got every
nut job on the Dark Web

06:02.449 --> 06:04.755
claiming to actually be Falken.

06:04.799 --> 06:06.104
- Can you blame them?

06:06.148 --> 06:07.628
Falken's been an urban legend
for almost a decade.

06:07.671 --> 06:10.239
Nobody knows who he really is,
beyond being a genius coder

06:10.282 --> 06:13.677
and a giant fan of the movie
"War Games."

06:13.721 --> 06:16.027
- You ever read
his manifestos on AI

06:16.071 --> 06:17.638
that he posted when he first
appeared on the chat rooms?

06:17.681 --> 06:20.292
They are sublime.

06:20.336 --> 06:22.033
Wait. Wait. Wait.

06:22.077 --> 06:25.080
Go--go back up to that message
from FIBONACCI61.

06:25.123 --> 06:27.169
- Fibonacci?
As in the mathematician.

06:27.212 --> 06:30.172
- Mm-hmm, the God Account's
got a thing for Fibonacci.

06:30.215 --> 06:31.826
Open it.

06:31.869 --> 06:36.352
- 1,600, 4:00,
with coordinates to a location.

06:41.139 --> 06:42.184
[electronic trill]

06:43.490 --> 06:46.318
- It's for Strawberry Fields
in Central Park.

06:48.930 --> 06:51.454
The seed pattern on
strawberries

06:51.498 --> 06:54.109
adhere to the Fibonacci
sequence.

06:54.152 --> 06:57.895
Whoever this is,
they're legit.

06:59.244 --> 07:02.291
- Wait, so you and a girl from
class saved a pregnant lady?

07:02.334 --> 07:04.293
- No, no, no.
We talked her down

07:04.336 --> 07:05.860
from having a panic attack

07:05.903 --> 07:07.992
and saved ourselves
from delivering her baby.

07:08.036 --> 07:09.733
- You made me come
all the way over here,

07:09.777 --> 07:13.128
and you've already helped
your Friend Suggestion?

07:13.171 --> 07:14.651
Okay, sorry, guys. Sorry.

07:14.695 --> 07:16.479
Lucy and I might have made
contact with someone

07:16.523 --> 07:18.263
who knows Falken.

07:18.307 --> 07:20.309
- No way. Who are they?
- I don't know.

07:20.352 --> 07:22.311
Just--they go by the username
FIBONACCI61,

07:22.354 --> 07:25.488
and they sent us coordinates
related to the sequence,

07:25.532 --> 07:28.317
and they want to meet later
this afternoon.

07:28.360 --> 07:30.145
- Is it legit?
- Not sure.

07:30.188 --> 07:32.495
Let Lucy and me check
this one out first.

07:32.539 --> 07:35.237
I don't want to scare him off
with too many people.

07:35.280 --> 07:37.152
Okay, well,
I'm gonna head out,

07:37.195 --> 07:40.503
Unless there's anything else--
- Actually, yeah, after Blair,

07:40.547 --> 07:42.287
I got a new Friend
Suggestion,

07:42.331 --> 07:46.901
and this time I'm really not
sure how we can help.

07:46.944 --> 07:48.772
- Come on.
We always say that.

07:48.816 --> 07:52.167
How bad could
their problem be?

07:54.865 --> 07:56.606
- His name is Sal Thompkins,

07:56.650 --> 08:00.131
71, he was a divorce lawyer,

08:00.175 --> 08:04.614
and as of a month ago...

08:04.658 --> 08:08.270
he's dead.

08:08.313 --> 08:10.620
- Yeah, that's pretty bad.

08:17.584 --> 08:22.023
- How does the God account
expect me to help a dead guy?

08:22.066 --> 08:25.679
- Well, think of this way--
you can't make it any worse.

08:25.722 --> 08:27.550
- Maybe we're supposed to help
someone he left behind.

08:27.594 --> 08:29.073
Did he have any family?

08:29.117 --> 08:30.553
- Nah, according
to his obituary

08:30.597 --> 08:32.424
he had no surviving relatives.

08:32.468 --> 08:35.645
His wife died years ago.

08:35.689 --> 08:37.952
- Then why send
the Friend Suggestion now?

08:37.995 --> 08:42.043
- Uh, guys, I think I know.

08:42.086 --> 08:45.394
- Oh, his estate sale's today
at his brownstone in Brooklyn.

08:45.437 --> 08:47.004
- Well, whatever's going on

08:47.048 --> 08:50.181
it looks like the answer's
at Sal's brownstone.

08:55.056 --> 08:56.753
- I love estate sales.

08:56.797 --> 08:58.233
You guys ever seen
"Estate Sale Wars"?

08:58.276 --> 08:59.669
I am obsessed.

08:59.713 --> 09:01.149
- You don't think it's weird,

09:01.192 --> 09:03.368
shopping for a dead person's
stuff?

09:03.412 --> 09:04.718
- Absolutely not.

09:06.502 --> 09:08.156
Nice paintings.
- Look around.

09:08.199 --> 09:10.854
There's no photos of his wife
or friends.

09:11.638 --> 09:13.509
- So how do you know
what's for sale?

09:13.553 --> 09:15.511
- Everything is for sale.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.818
- This fork is for sale?
- Yeah.

09:17.861 --> 09:19.515
- That lamp is for sale?
- Yeah.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.865
- Can we focus?
- Okay.

09:21.909 --> 09:23.650
- This a three-floor
brownstone.

09:23.693 --> 09:24.955
We need to divide and conquer.

09:24.999 --> 09:26.653
There has to be something
in here

09:26.696 --> 09:28.742
that will tell us what
we're supposed to do for Sal.

09:28.785 --> 09:31.614
Hopefully,
we'll know it when we see it.

09:35.226 --> 09:36.184
[fork clatters]

09:36.227 --> 09:39.491
[indistinct chatter]

09:41.885 --> 09:44.496
- Dad, I'm sure Trish will be
here soon.

09:44.540 --> 09:46.498
- I know.
- Oh, I thought detected

09:46.542 --> 09:47.630
some nerves.

09:47.674 --> 09:49.240
- Why would I be nervous?

09:49.284 --> 09:51.025
Trish and I have gone out
on one date.

09:51.068 --> 09:52.635
It was a very nice time,

09:52.679 --> 09:55.682
and so we are going
to go out again.

09:55.725 --> 09:58.249
It is as simple as that.

09:58.293 --> 10:00.077
- Right.

10:00.121 --> 10:01.818
- And there she is.

10:03.298 --> 10:06.693
- Dad, she's a fox.
- Mm-hmm.

10:06.736 --> 10:08.738
Trish.
- Hey, Arthur.

10:08.782 --> 10:10.653
- How are you?
- Good, how are you?

10:10.697 --> 10:12.133
Good to see you.

10:12.176 --> 10:15.353
- I'd like you to meet
my daughter, Ali.

10:15.397 --> 10:16.877
- I'm a hugger.
[laughs]

10:16.920 --> 10:18.705
