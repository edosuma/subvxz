00:07.094 --> 00:08.704
Previously onYoung Sheldon...Excuse me.

00:08.747 --> 00:11.402
You Coach Ballard?That'd be me.

00:11.446 --> 00:13.056
My daughter's here to try out.

00:13.100 --> 00:15.276
Come on, I'm not gonna
put a girl on my team.

00:15.319 --> 00:16.581
Why not?

00:16.625 --> 00:18.409
She's got pigtails.

00:18.453 --> 00:20.063
You're not even gonna
give her a chance?

00:20.107 --> 00:21.934
No.

00:21.978 --> 00:24.328
Hey. Hello. Can I talk to you?

00:24.372 --> 00:25.721
Yeah.

00:25.764 --> 00:27.592
You tell my granddaughter
she can't play baseball?

00:27.636 --> 00:29.551
Well, I was just looking out
for her, that's all.

00:29.594 --> 00:31.988
Well, we don't need you
deciding what's best for her.

00:32.032 --> 00:34.730
Or what?Or you and me are
gonna have problems.

00:36.253 --> 00:38.299
We're back!How'd it go?

00:38.342 --> 00:39.604
She made the team.

00:39.648 --> 00:41.215
Congratulations!

00:41.258 --> 00:43.434
And Meemaw got a date
with the coach.

00:43.478 --> 00:46.829
What?It was a productive afternoon.

00:50.702 --> 00:52.269
You sure you don't
want me to stay?

00:52.313 --> 00:54.576
You promised you'd take me
to RadioShack.

00:54.619 --> 00:56.665
Sheldon, this is
a big day for your sister.

00:56.708 --> 00:58.101
I'm fine, Dad.

00:58.145 --> 00:59.320
Come on.

00:59.363 --> 01:01.757
I really don't want to go
to RadioShack.

01:01.800 --> 01:04.368
Ah. George.

01:04.412 --> 01:06.457
Dale.Hey, Missy.

01:06.501 --> 01:08.807
Why don't you get out there
and start warming up?

01:08.851 --> 01:10.809
Okay.

01:10.853 --> 01:12.637
And you must be Sheldon.

01:12.681 --> 01:14.813
Your grandmother
told me all about you.

01:14.857 --> 01:16.815
We're going to RadioShack.

01:16.859 --> 01:18.861
Yeah, she didn't lie.

01:20.167 --> 01:21.777
George, I figure
we kind of got off

01:21.820 --> 01:23.170
on the wrong foot
the other day.

01:23.213 --> 01:25.172
Don't worry about it.Well, I do worry about it.

01:25.215 --> 01:27.478
I-I'd like to take you
out for a beer,

01:27.522 --> 01:28.827
if that would be okay.

01:28.871 --> 01:32.092
It appears Meemaw
told him about you, too.

01:33.223 --> 01:34.746
Sounds great.

01:35.791 --> 01:37.749
Have a good practice.Thank you.

01:39.795 --> 01:41.449
It's nice that you're
going to socialize

01:41.492 --> 01:43.668
with Meemaw's new boyfriend.I know.

01:43.712 --> 01:45.714
She's gonna hate it.

01:46.889 --> 01:49.805
♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am ♪

01:49.848 --> 01:52.634
♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain

01:52.677 --> 01:55.506
♪ I bet I could be your hero

01:55.550 --> 01:57.334
♪ I am a mighty little man

01:57.378 --> 02:01.817
♪ I am a mighty little man.♪

02:06.256 --> 02:08.519
Hey, Clark.
Today's the day.

02:08.563 --> 02:09.694
It's in the back.

02:09.738 --> 02:10.695
I'll go get it.

02:10.739 --> 02:12.044
What's he getting?

02:12.088 --> 02:14.830
A direct-connect
300 baud modem.

02:14.873 --> 02:16.310
How much?

02:16.353 --> 02:18.094
Don't worry, I'm
using my allowance.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.183
Plus, Clark gave me
a healthy discount

02:20.227 --> 02:22.185
for helping with his
application to medical school.

02:22.229 --> 02:24.187
Okay.

02:24.231 --> 02:25.493
What's a modem do?

02:25.536 --> 02:27.059
It allows me
to connect my computer

02:27.103 --> 02:29.061
to other computers
that also have one.

02:29.105 --> 02:30.846
Why would you need to do that?

02:30.889 --> 02:32.587
So I can share
my scientific ideas

02:32.630 --> 02:34.328
with academics
all over the world.

02:34.371 --> 02:38.288
It's like the cybernetic version
of the Algonquin Round Table.

02:39.376 --> 02:40.682
I don't know what that means.

02:40.725 --> 02:42.205
That's okay, you're still my dad

02:42.249 --> 02:44.555
and I'm genetically obligated
to love you.

02:47.950 --> 02:49.343
Missy, how was practice?

02:49.386 --> 02:50.866
So good.

02:50.909 --> 02:52.433
Tell us everything.

02:52.476 --> 02:55.087
The boys were a little mean
at first, but I handled it.

02:55.131 --> 02:56.741
Can I warm up with you?

02:56.785 --> 02:58.743
I don't play baseball
with girls.

02:58.787 --> 03:01.224
Really? Your friend's
playing with one.

03:01.268 --> 03:03.487
Ooh!

03:03.531 --> 03:06.316
I am so proud of you.

03:06.360 --> 03:07.926
Well, I'm glad you all
had a good day.

03:07.970 --> 03:09.885
Not just them.
Guess who

03:09.928 --> 03:11.103
I'm grabbing
a beer with.

03:11.147 --> 03:13.236
Your new friend, Dale.

03:13.280 --> 03:14.977
Are you kidding me?

03:15.020 --> 03:17.197
You were right,
she's not happy.

03:18.633 --> 03:20.722
INSTRUCTOR: We're gonna do
a little combination here.

03:21.897 --> 03:25.683
Here we go.
Ready and out, in, up, down...

03:25.727 --> 03:28.120
Out, in, up, down.

03:28.164 --> 03:29.252
Hello.

03:29.296 --> 03:30.427
LISA:
Hi, Georgie.

03:30.471 --> 03:32.299
It's Lisa, from English class.

03:32.342 --> 03:33.996
Oh, hey. What's up?

03:34.039 --> 03:36.433
I was wondering if you could
help me with our homework.

03:36.477 --> 03:37.956
Crap, we have homework?

03:39.175 --> 03:40.611
You're so funny.

03:40.655 --> 03:41.917
I think so.

03:41.960 --> 03:42.961
Most people don't.

03:44.006 --> 03:45.834
What's that noise?

03:45.877 --> 03:47.618
No idea.

03:47.662 --> 03:49.968
Georgie, I need you
to get off the phone.

03:50.012 --> 03:51.361
Hang on, Lisa.

03:51.405 --> 03:53.450
I'm helping someone
with their English homework.

03:53.494 --> 03:54.799
I don't have time for jokes.

03:54.843 --> 03:57.019
I need the phone line
to connect my modem.

03:57.062 --> 03:58.281
What the hell's a modem?

03:58.325 --> 04:00.152
It links my computer

04:00.196 --> 04:02.459
to an interconnected web
of other computers

04:02.503 --> 04:04.853
in order to facilitate
the exchange of ideas.

04:04.896 --> 04:07.334
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard of.

04:07.377 --> 04:09.466
ADULT SHELDON:
Sadly, that was not

04:09.510 --> 04:11.729
the stupidest thing
he ever said.

04:11.773 --> 04:13.949
INSTRUCTOR :
Lift, lift, squeeze it.

04:16.473 --> 04:18.170
Have you tried
the meatballs here?

04:18.214 --> 04:20.216
They are fantastic.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.217
I haven't.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.566
But speaking of meatballs,

04:22.610 --> 04:24.829
I hear you're gonna hang out
with my son-in-law.

04:24.873 --> 04:26.222
Yeah.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.964
Hmm.

04:29.007 --> 04:30.313
Oh.

04:30.357 --> 04:32.228
You don't like that at all.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.838
No, it's fine with me.

04:33.882 --> 04:35.492
I hope you all go out and...

04:35.536 --> 04:37.668
have a grand old time.Oh.

04:37.712 --> 04:39.235
Yeah, well,
what's the matter?

04:39.279 --> 04:41.846
You afraid I'm gonna
find out all your secrets?Calm down.

04:41.890 --> 04:43.935
You're enjoying this
a little too much.

04:43.979 --> 04:45.502
Enjoying it? I'm loving it.

04:45.546 --> 04:47.461
Look how mad
you're getting.

04:47.504 --> 04:49.550
Come on, what's he got on you?

04:49.593 --> 04:51.160
Did you do some
jail time?

04:51.203 --> 04:52.944
Were you a go-go dancer?

04:52.988 --> 04:54.206
Hmm.

04:54.250 --> 04:57.688
Have you got a tattoo
in a naughty place?

05:00.561 --> 05:01.562
Can I see it?

05:05.217 --> 05:07.176
Ooh! Someone responded
to a theory I posted

05:07.219 --> 05:09.483
on the physics
bulletin board.

05:09.526 --> 05:11.485
He called my
work flawed.

05:11.528 --> 05:12.964
That's rude.

05:13.008 --> 05:14.618
Let him know
he can't push you around.

05:14.662 --> 05:16.707
That's what I did
at baseball practice.

05:16.751 --> 05:18.796
I'd rather not resort to
name-calling.

05:18.840 --> 05:21.582
It usually gets me stuffed
somewhere uncomfortable.

05:21.625 --> 05:22.887
That's in person,

05:22.931 --> 05:24.672
where people know
you're pathetic and weak.

05:24.715 --> 05:26.282
That's true.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.458
This is completely anonymous.

05:28.502 --> 05:30.025
I can say whatever I want

05:30.068 --> 05:31.722
without fear of
physical retaliation.

05:31.766 --> 05:32.941
Thanks.

05:34.203 --> 05:35.683
ADULT SHELDON:
And on that day,

05:35.726 --> 05:37.467
my sister created

05:37.511 --> 05:39.730
the first Internet flame war.

05:39.774 --> 05:43.081
Ooh, that is as cruel
as it is grammatical.

05:43.125 --> 05:44.692
And send.

05:49.871 --> 05:52.656
I tried to call you last night;
the phone was busy.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.919
Oh, yeah, that
was Sheldon.

05:54.963 --> 05:58.445
Sheldon has friends
he talks on the phone with?

05:58.488 --> 06:01.752
Well, his computer was talking
to another computer.

06:01.796 --> 06:02.927
Oh.

06:02.971 --> 06:04.625
And the world makes sense again.

06:04.668 --> 06:06.496
GEORGE SR:
Morning.

06:06.540 --> 06:09.847
Just a reminder,
I'm gonna be late tonight.

06:09.891 --> 06:12.284
Hanging with my new buddy Dale.

06:12.328 --> 06:14.504
Well, I hope you two
have fun together.

06:14.548 --> 06:17.289
Oh, we will.
So much to talk about.

06:17.333 --> 06:19.727
You better respect
her privacy.

06:19.770 --> 06:21.816
Oh, I don't plan
on doing that at all.

06:21.859 --> 06:23.513
Don't you need to go to work?

06:23.557 --> 06:25.863
Yes, but I don't want to leave
until I know you're upset.

06:25.907 --> 06:28.910
Well, I'm sorry, but I'm not.

06:30.912 --> 06:32.392
Yeah, you are.

06:32.435 --> 06:33.915
Bye.

06:37.788 --> 06:42.184
It's just so easy. All you do
is type in the Usenet address:

06:42.227 --> 06:46.797
"sci... dot... theory...

06:46.841 --> 06:50.366
"dot... physics...

06:50.410 --> 06:54.109
"dot... research...

06:54.152 --> 06:57.068
dot... quantum."

06:57.112 --> 06:58.809
Press enter, and
it comes right up.

07:09.690 --> 07:11.909
Careful. In WarGames,

07:11.953 --> 07:13.998
Matthew Broderick
almost blew up the world.

07:14.042 --> 07:15.652
The only thing
I'm gonna be blowing up

07:15.696 --> 07:17.915
is this fellow's
flimsy argument.

07:19.482 --> 07:22.137
That was one of my classic
jokes; feel free to laugh.

07:26.794 --> 07:29.753
See? Like magic.

07:32.539 --> 07:34.105
Hey.

07:34.149 --> 07:37.021
Uh, why are you dressed
like a boy?

07:37.065 --> 07:39.154
I made the baseball team.

07:39.197 --> 07:41.765
Oh, so you are a boy.

07:51.819 --> 07:53.864
Get out, I need to change.

07:53.908 --> 07:56.519
You seem upset.I am.

07:56.563 --> 07:58.869
I was right? Good for me.

07:58.913 --> 08:00.088
Just get out.

08:03.308 --> 08:05.136
Wait.

08:05.180 --> 08:07.008
You get picked on
all the time.

08:07.051 --> 08:08.662
How do you
deal with it?

08:08.705 --> 08:10.228
Who's picking on you?

08:10.272 --> 08:12.056
It doesn't matter, just tell me.

08:12.100 --> 08:15.146
I usually start by telling
myself how much smarter I am

08:15.190 --> 08:18.454
than the person who's picking on
me, but that won't work for you.

08:18.498 --> 08:19.890
Out.

08:22.110 --> 08:23.720
Missy?

08:25.592 --> 08:27.158
What?

08:27.202 --> 08:29.596
Sometimes I imagine that I'm
an ion with a positive charge

08:29.639 --> 08:31.467
and they're an ion
with a negative charge.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.338
It's so that whatever
they say bounces off me

08:33.382 --> 08:34.514
and sticks to them.

08:37.778 --> 08:39.083
Hi, Georgie.

08:39.127 --> 08:40.563
Hey.

08:40.607 --> 08:42.478
I like that jacket.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.175
Then you'll probably
like my pants;

08:44.219 --> 08:46.090
they're made of
the same stuff.

08:48.832 --> 08:50.965
Well, see you in class.

08:51.008 --> 08:53.315
Okay.

09:04.369 --> 09:05.501
Veronica.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.372
Hey, Georgie.

09:07.416 --> 09:08.635
What's up?

09:08.678 --> 09:11.246
We're-we're friends, right?

09:11.289 --> 09:12.682
Yeah.

09:12.726 --> 09:14.815
We're just friends?

09:15.859 --> 09:17.034
What do you mean?

09:17.078 --> 09:18.209
Well, I've asked you out

09:18.253 --> 09:20.734
a bunch and you've
made it pretty clear

09:20.777 --> 09:22.562
you weren't interested,

09:22.605 --> 09:24.215
but before I asked out
another girl,

09:24.259 --> 09:25.652
I just wanted
to make sure that...

09:25.695 --> 09:27.218
It's fine.

09:27.262 --> 09:30.700
You sure?
Because if it's not...

09:30.744 --> 09:32.572
Georgie,
I need to focus

09:32.615 --> 09:35.923
on my relationship
with God right now,

09:35.966 --> 09:38.534
but I'm really
happy for you.

09:39.927 --> 09:43.408
Okay. Cool.

09:45.019 --> 09:46.673
Cool.

09:48.544 --> 09:52.200
Well, guess I'll
see you around.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.246
Yup.

10:19.227 --> 10:22.360
Well, I-I was married for
18 years and I got to tell you,

10:22.404 --> 10:25.799
those were the two best years
of my life.

10:25.842 --> 10:29.063
Ah. What's it like, you know,
being single at your age?

10:29.106 --> 10:30.717
Why, you thinking about it?

10:30.760 --> 10:32.936
No, no, everything's fine.

10:32.980 --> 10:35.547
Happily married, just,
uh, just curious.Yeah...

10:35.591 --> 10:37.071
Come on, now. She's not here.

10:37.114 --> 10:40.640
Well, to answer your question,
it's just great.

10:40.683 --> 10:43.120
See, I get to wander around
my house in my underwear,

10:43.164 --> 10:46.384
and I can make whatever
bodily noises I choose

10:46.428 --> 10:47.690
whenever I choose.

10:47.734 --> 10:50.171
Ah. I do that now.

10:50.214 --> 10:52.086
Well, then,
you got yourself a keeper.

10:54.218 --> 10:56.873
So how'd you wind up
coaching baseball?

10:56.917 --> 10:58.396
Well, with
the sporting goods store,

10:58.440 --> 11:00.050
you know, I've sponsored
a couple of teams,

11:00.094 --> 11:01.748
and then this year,
my grandson wanted to play,

11:01.791 --> 11:04.794
so it lets me spend
more time with him.

11:04.838 --> 11:06.709
That's nice. Yeah,
I coach my son in football.

11:06.753 --> 11:08.145
Sheldon?

11:08.189 --> 11:10.800
Oh, God, no. Can you imagine?

11:10.844 --> 11:13.281
You really scared me there
for a second.Yeah.

11:16.284 --> 11:18.895
So you're dating
my mother-in-law.Oh, no.

11:18.939 --> 11:22.464
Now, did she send you here
on a fact-finding mission?No.

11:22.507 --> 11:23.944
No, i-if anything, she's worried

11:23.987 --> 11:26.076
I'm gonna tell you things
about her.

11:26.120 --> 11:27.991
Really?
Mm-hmm.

11:28.035 --> 11:29.819
Well, I tell you what,
why don't we get another drink

11:29.863 --> 11:31.212
and let's get to it?

11:31.255 --> 11:35.085
Would you get this man
a bucket of beer here, please?

11:36.565 --> 11:39.350
I'm sorry those girls
were so mean.

11:39.394 --> 11:41.135
They didn't just
call me a boy.

11:41.178 --> 11:43.006
They wouldn't sit
with me at lunch.

11:43.050 --> 11:45.008
No one talked to me at recess.

11:45.052 --> 11:46.531
Aw, baby.

11:46.575 --> 11:48.533
Somebody crossed out
"Missy Cooper" in my notebook

11:48.577 --> 11:50.361
and wrote "Mister Cooper."

11:50.405 --> 11:51.841
Well, if that's
what they're like,

11:51.885 --> 11:53.713
maybe you don't
want them as friends.

11:53.756 --> 11:57.760
I don't think I want
to play baseball anymore.

11:57.804 --> 12:01.242
If that's what you want,
it's your decision.

12:06.464 --> 12:07.683
Hello?

12:07.727 --> 12:10.381
I heard your daughter's
playing baseball.

12:10.425 --> 12:12.035
Hey, Brenda.

12:12.079 --> 12:13.123
What were you thinking?

12:13.167 --> 12:14.908
Excuse me?

12:14.951 --> 12:16.866
My Billy's on that team.

12:16.910 --> 12:18.868
Baseball's for boys.

12:18.912 --> 12:20.740
Says who?

12:20.783 --> 12:22.742
Says everyone.
It's not ladylike.

12:22.785 --> 12:25.048
Save some pudding
for your father!

12:25.092 --> 12:26.876
Aw.

12:26.920 --> 12:29.226
Okay, where was I?

12:29.270 --> 12:31.054
You were telling me
what was ladylike

12:31.098 --> 12:33.404
and then yelled at your son
like a dock foreman.

12:33.448 --> 12:35.711
Listen, I'm just
doing you a favor.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.974
The other moms on the team
are starting to talk.

12:38.018 --> 12:40.585
Well, maybe the other moms
need to mind their own business.

12:40.629 --> 12:41.891
Come on, Mary.

12:41.935 --> 12:44.415
Isn't one weird kid
in your family enough?

12:44.459 --> 12:46.113
You going for a record?

12:49.638 --> 12:51.771
You're playing baseball.

12:51.814 --> 12:53.337
But you said it was my decision.

12:53.381 --> 12:55.339
It is. And you're playing.

12:57.167 --> 12:59.909
There you are.
Oh, yeah.

12:59.953 --> 13:01.824
Connie's great.

13:01.868 --> 13:04.653
You can have a beer with her,
watch a football game,

13:04.696 --> 13:06.263
joke around.

13:06.307 --> 13:07.830
She doesn't mind if you swear.

13:07.874 --> 13:10.702
In fact, that woman's got
a mouth on her.

13:10.746 --> 13:13.444
I have noticed that.: Yeah.

13:13.488 --> 13:16.186
You know,
I just realized something.

13:16.230 --> 13:18.188
I got more in common
with my mother-in-law

13:18.232 --> 13:19.711
than I do my own wife.

13:19.755 --> 13:21.148
That's kind of creepy.

13:21.191 --> 13:23.324
Yeah.

13:23.367 --> 13:25.152
Let's hope the beer does its job

13:25.195 --> 13:27.241
and I don't remember
this tomorrow.

13:27.284 --> 13:30.592
Well, hey, tell me something
about this guy she was seeing.

13:30.635 --> 13:33.203
Mm. The scientist.

13:33.247 --> 13:35.249
Really? A scientist?Yeah, not
with test tubes;

13:35.292 --> 13:38.948
more with arithmetic,
thinking and stuff.

13:38.992 --> 13:40.515
Uh-huh. A physicist.There you go.

13:40.558 --> 13:43.126
Yeah. Nice enough fella.

13:43.170 --> 13:44.954
Always reminded me
of that cartoon owl

13:44.998 --> 13:46.477
in the Tootsie Pop commercials.

13:46.521 --> 13:49.219
Hmm. Well, why'd they break up?

13:49.263 --> 13:51.961
Uh, you know.

13:52.005 --> 13:53.136
You know, things happen.

13:53.180 --> 13:55.747
Uh-huh. What things?

13:55.791 --> 13:58.315
Eh...Come on, now.

13:58.359 --> 14:01.579
At least tell me if there's
something I need to worry about.

14:01.623 --> 14:03.016
Oh, no. Connie's rock solid.

14:03.059 --> 14:05.061
Unless you put on
a little weight.

14:05.105 --> 14:06.976
Then you will hear about it.Ah.

14:07.020 --> 14:09.370
Uh, you want to switch
to light beer?

14:09.413 --> 14:13.026
Hey. I may have boobs,
but I'm still a man.

14:26.430 --> 14:29.738
Well, I never.

14:29.781 --> 14:31.435
Hello?

14:31.479 --> 14:33.263
I'm having a scientific argument
with someone

14:33.307 --> 14:34.612
and I need your help.

14:34.656 --> 14:37.267
I do love a good science fight.

14:37.311 --> 14:39.661
Has it devolved
to name-calling yet?

14:39.704 --> 14:42.272
Yes. I called him
a Pongo pygmaeus.

14:42.316 --> 14:43.621
Oh!

14:43.665 --> 14:45.623
A Bornean orangutan.

14:45.667 --> 14:50.063
That is a creature who would be
very bad at science. Well done.

14:50.106 --> 14:51.281
I know.

14:51.325 --> 14:52.804
So how can I help?

14:52.848 --> 14:53.936
I posted a theory

14:53.980 --> 14:55.459
on the collapse
of wave function.

14:55.503 --> 14:57.113
We've been arguing
back and forth

14:57.157 --> 14:59.942
and he's saying that my
probabilities come out negative.

14:59.986 --> 15:01.335
Hmm. I see.

15:01.378 --> 15:03.772
Have you considered
that negative probabilities

15:03.815 --> 15:05.513
can still have meaning?

15:05.556 --> 15:08.777
Ooh, I hadn't.
That suggests another idea.

15:08.820 --> 15:10.779
I can argue
that negative probabilities

15:10.822 --> 15:12.999
only show up
in intermediate steps.

15:13.042 --> 15:15.175
I'm gonna destroy him with this.

15:15.218 --> 15:19.744
And when you do, feel free to
call him a Scarabaeus viettei,

15:19.788 --> 15:21.050
a dung beetle.

15:21.094 --> 15:23.574
Oh, I so admire your mind.

15:23.618 --> 15:25.925
Back at you, little man.

15:29.015 --> 15:30.494
Can I top off your coffee?

15:30.538 --> 15:32.757
Well, that's awfully
nice of you.

15:32.801 --> 15:35.021
You know me.
I'm a pleaser.

15:35.064 --> 15:37.545
You just want to know
what I talked about with Dale.

15:37.588 --> 15:39.242
Not really.

15:40.635 --> 15:42.419
I promise you got nothing
to worry about.

15:42.463 --> 15:44.030
I didn't say a thing.

15:44.073 --> 15:45.857
Thank you.

15:45.901 --> 15:47.859
So what'd you
find out about him?

15:47.903 --> 15:50.036
Oh, I see how this works.

15:50.079 --> 15:51.863
You're damn straight
that's how it works.

15:51.907 --> 15:53.996
Now spill.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.998
Well, let's see.

15:56.042 --> 15:58.000
Uh, he likes to drink,

15:58.044 --> 15:59.436
likes to hunt.

15:59.480 --> 16:00.698
Uh, he's got a son
who's divorced.

16:00.742 --> 16:02.831
I know all this. Go on.

16:02.874 --> 16:05.051
That's all I got.

16:06.095 --> 16:08.054
You are useless.

16:09.229 --> 16:10.970
When he comes to his senses
and dumps you,

16:11.013 --> 16:12.884
I'm gonna stay friends with him.Good.

16:12.928 --> 16:15.452
If he dumps me,
he deserves to suffer.

16:22.155 --> 16:23.460
Hey, Dale.

16:23.504 --> 16:25.201
Hey, George.

16:25.245 --> 16:28.291
So, uh, she gonna
be okay out there?

16:28.335 --> 16:29.553
Well, I talked
to the other coach.

16:29.597 --> 16:30.946
The boys are gonna
leave her alone.

16:32.426 --> 16:34.689
Hey, Billy!

16:34.732 --> 16:36.560
You're supposed
to be warming up.

16:36.604 --> 16:38.345
I found a worm!

16:38.388 --> 16:40.390
Do you want to coach
a baseball team?

ask Him for a win.

16:49.269 --> 16:50.748
I got money on this.

16:50.792 --> 16:53.142
You bet on a kids'
baseball game?

16:53.186 --> 16:54.796
