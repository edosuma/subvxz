WEBVTT

01:54.462 --> 01:56.116
-No!

02:23.926 --> 02:26.146
-Today I'm here with
the one and only...

02:26.276 --> 02:27.669
-Bella Denton.

02:27.799 --> 02:30.062
-Whoo!

02:30.193 --> 02:32.978
-10 out of 10.

02:33.109 --> 02:34.937
Top-secret mission.

02:39.202 --> 02:40.421
Think it's open?

02:40.551 --> 02:41.813
-I don't know.

02:41.944 --> 02:44.947
-Oh. What? Yo!

02:46.383 --> 02:48.472
- Hey!

02:50.387 --> 02:51.823
Hey, hey!

02:51.954 --> 02:54.435
-Are you...

02:54.565 --> 02:56.263
-The key!

02:59.048 --> 03:00.832
See ya later.

03:06.011 --> 03:07.883
Let's go.

03:08.013 --> 03:09.667
-She took all of it. Let's go.

03:09.798 --> 03:11.321
Get in the car.
Get in the car. Get in the car.

03:11.452 --> 03:12.757
Start the car!

03:12.888 --> 03:15.107
That was awesome.

03:16.761 --> 03:18.372
-Oh, shit.

03:25.030 --> 03:28.382
Turn to your side.

03:28.512 --> 03:31.428
Other side.

03:31.559 --> 03:33.561
Face the front.

03:33.691 --> 03:36.390
Lower the sign.
State your name.

03:36.520 --> 03:38.261
- Bella Denton.

03:51.535 --> 03:54.059
-Place of birth.
-Melbourne.

03:58.107 --> 04:01.328
-Australia. You know, where they
used to send the criminals.

04:01.458 --> 04:03.765
-Is there anyone
who can sign for you?

04:06.681 --> 04:08.248
Parents?

04:10.293 --> 04:14.297
-Oh! Must have left them
on my other jacket.

04:14.428 --> 04:17.648
-Are they not around?

04:17.779 --> 04:19.520
-Mom died.

04:21.957 --> 04:24.786
-Your father.
Where can we find him?

04:28.268 --> 04:30.705
-Motor vehicle theft.

04:30.835 --> 04:33.490
Driving without a license.

04:33.621 --> 04:37.233
Petty larceny.
And resisting arrest.

04:37.364 --> 04:39.714
Quite the night, Bella.

04:39.844 --> 04:43.152
-Well, you know, if you're gonna
do something, do it properly.

04:43.283 --> 04:46.373
-You're probably looking
at 36 months. You know that?

04:48.288 --> 04:49.463
So...

04:52.161 --> 04:56.165
Is there anyone,
anyone at all...

04:56.296 --> 04:58.472
that we can call?

05:06.567 --> 05:08.003
-No.

05:44.213 --> 05:45.475
Mm-hmm.

05:50.698 --> 05:52.003
Yeah.

06:07.671 --> 06:09.673
Here we go.

06:23.165 --> 06:24.296
-Bella. Bella Denton.

06:24.427 --> 06:25.602
-Yeah, I don't have money.

06:25.733 --> 06:27.474
-Bella, my name is Ed Meeser.

06:27.604 --> 06:30.520
I've been looking for you
for a long time.

06:30.651 --> 06:33.305
Well, there's no good way
to say this, Bella,

06:33.436 --> 06:35.220
so I'm just gonna
rip the Band-Aid off.

06:35.351 --> 06:38.876
Your father's passed away.

06:39.007 --> 06:41.226
You must be devastated.

06:41.357 --> 06:43.011
-Yeah, I'll be fine.

06:43.141 --> 06:45.622
Just, uh, do me a favor
and lose this number, okay?

06:45.753 --> 06:47.755
-Bella, he left you something.

06:47.885 --> 06:49.931
-What, besides
a bad case of PTSD

06:50.061 --> 06:51.193
and some abandonment issues?

06:51.323 --> 06:53.021
That's so generous of him.

06:53.151 --> 06:56.590
-A boat, Bella.
He left you a boat.

06:56.720 --> 06:59.636
-Whew!
And I fucking hate boats.

06:59.767 --> 07:01.725
-You won't hate this one.
I promise.

07:03.597 --> 07:08.123
- Dude.
Who are you again?

07:08.253 --> 07:09.820
-My name is Ed Meeser,

07:09.951 --> 07:11.561
and I was your dad's
best friend,

07:11.692 --> 07:13.476
his business partner.

07:13.607 --> 07:14.999
He never mentioned me?

07:15.130 --> 07:19.134
-Uh...let me think.
Yeah. No.

07:19.264 --> 07:21.397
The last time
my dad and I spoke,

07:21.528 --> 07:25.575
the topic was "My Little Pony,"
Pinkie Pie.

07:25.706 --> 07:28.186
So, no, you didn't come up.

07:28.317 --> 07:29.971
What the fuck am I
going to do with a boat?

07:30.101 --> 07:31.668
-I don't know.
You can sail around the world.

07:31.799 --> 07:33.453
You can sell it.

07:33.583 --> 07:34.932
I just need you to come here
and get this damn boat

07:35.063 --> 07:37.848
out of my hair, okay?

07:37.979 --> 07:39.023
-I don't know. Where's "here"?

07:39.154 --> 07:40.982
-Gulfport, Mississippi.

07:43.811 --> 07:47.597
-Well, I still don't have
any money.

07:47.728 --> 07:50.774
-Yeah. I'm gonna
arrange it for you.

07:55.126 --> 07:56.911
-Alright.

10:11.828 --> 10:15.092
-Bella.
-Hi. Ed Meeser, right?

10:15.223 --> 10:18.835
-Yes. So good to see you.
-Yeah, you too.

10:18.966 --> 10:20.620
And by the way,
thank you for all this.

10:20.750 --> 10:22.796
-Of course. Yeah, was it --
Was it okay?

10:22.926 --> 10:24.449
-Yeah, it was actually
really nice.

10:24.580 --> 10:26.103
-Yeah? Well,
I'm sorry it's under

10:26.234 --> 10:27.409
such terrible circumstances.

10:27.539 --> 10:29.672
-Yeah. Yeah, it's fine.

10:29.803 --> 10:33.067
So, uh, which one of these
bad boys is mine?

10:33.197 --> 10:35.243
-Ah.

10:35.373 --> 10:37.027
There it is.

10:37.158 --> 10:40.640
-Wait, the red one?
That's kind of cool.

10:40.770 --> 10:42.163
-No, Bella.

10:42.293 --> 10:43.468
It's the one next to
the red one.

10:43.599 --> 10:46.471
It's the one
that says your name on it.

10:46.602 --> 10:48.517
The Bella.

10:48.648 --> 10:51.955
-Very funny. Is that a joke?
-No. It's not a joke.

10:52.086 --> 10:55.916
Your father loved you very much.
I keep telling you that.

10:56.046 --> 10:58.353
-Yeah, right.

10:58.483 --> 10:59.876
So how'd you know my dad,
anyway?

11:00.007 --> 11:01.486
You guys hang out, fish,

11:01.617 --> 11:03.271
hang out on a giant yacht
that I didn't know about?

11:03.401 --> 11:05.839
- Come on.

11:05.969 --> 11:08.624
Walk with me.

11:08.755 --> 11:11.758
No, we, uh -- we were
in the military together.

11:11.888 --> 11:13.324
He didn't --
He didn't mention that?

11:13.455 --> 11:15.979
We, uh -- He -- He, uh --

11:16.110 --> 11:18.547
He helped me transition
back into civilian life

11:18.678 --> 11:20.114
when I got out.
-Military. Huh.

11:20.244 --> 11:23.160
That's new information.
So what did you transition?

11:23.291 --> 11:26.381
You're obviously doing
very well for yourself.

11:26.511 --> 11:27.948
-Well, I -- A little of this,

11:28.078 --> 11:30.341
a little of that,
and mostly consulting.

11:30.472 --> 11:32.169
Did he ever mention Arcana?

11:32.300 --> 11:34.781
-Is that a "My Little Pony"?

11:34.911 --> 11:36.913
-No, Bella. I --

11:37.044 --> 11:38.610
I'm just kind of in shock

11:38.741 --> 11:42.745
because, you know, your dad,
he spoke about you all the time.

11:42.876 --> 11:45.182
-Yeah, he mentioned that
on the phone a lot of times.

11:45.313 --> 11:48.533
Thing is, haven't spoken to him
in 20 years, so, unusual.

11:48.664 --> 11:51.493
-Right. Wow. Alright.

11:51.623 --> 11:53.800
Uh, we just have to take care of
one little thing

11:53.930 --> 11:55.671
before we can get --
get on the yacht.

11:55.802 --> 11:57.238
And you have your passport?

11:57.368 --> 11:58.935
-Yeah.

11:59.066 --> 12:00.284
Yeah.

12:03.331 --> 12:05.768
-Gabriel.
-You again?

12:05.899 --> 12:08.423
-Told you I'd find her.

12:08.553 --> 12:10.120
You owe me 100 bucks.

12:10.251 --> 12:12.253
-$100?
-You owe me 100 bucks.

12:12.383 --> 12:15.952
-We said $20.
-No, we said $100.

12:16.083 --> 12:18.259
-$20.

12:18.389 --> 12:20.130
-I'm not betting with you
anymore.

12:22.219 --> 12:23.960
Let me see if this is legit.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.406
-Good?

12:41.761 --> 12:43.414
-I got to say, man,
this looks fake.

12:43.545 --> 12:44.764
-Oh, come on.

12:44.894 --> 12:46.461
-It's not fake. It's Australian.

12:46.591 --> 12:48.289
Do you know every country
has their own passport?

12:48.419 --> 12:49.769
It's wild, isn't it?

12:49.899 --> 12:51.422
That's crazy, right?

12:51.553 --> 12:53.468
-You see? It's Australian.

12:57.124 --> 12:58.299
-Get out of here, man.

12:58.429 --> 13:01.432
-You owe me 80 bucks.

13:01.563 --> 13:03.086
-What was that about?

13:03.217 --> 13:04.435
There was a little
miscommunication

13:04.566 --> 13:05.872
when your father passed,

13:06.002 --> 13:07.569
and the government
impounded the boat,

13:07.699 --> 13:11.225
but it is back in the hands
of its rightful owner.

13:11.355 --> 13:12.879
You.

13:13.009 --> 13:15.359
Congratulations.
You have a boat.

13:15.490 --> 13:17.274
-Right. I have a boat.

13:47.522 --> 13:49.306
And he really
never told you the story

13:49.437 --> 13:51.308
about how I almost drowned
on his watch

13:51.439 --> 13:55.399
and I actually kind
of hate the ocean?

13:55.530 --> 13:58.228
-No, he didn't say that.
-Well, you know.

13:58.359 --> 14:00.709
-Are you afraid of water?

14:00.840 --> 14:04.974
-Yeah.
Yeah, I-I'm afraid of water.

14:05.105 --> 14:07.237
-It's okay. A lot of people
are afraid of the water.

14:07.368 --> 14:09.718
-Alright, relax. I'm fine.
I'm fine.

14:12.982 --> 14:16.638
You know what?
I-I don't want this thing.

14:16.768 --> 14:18.770
You want to make me an offer?
I hate boats.

14:18.901 --> 14:21.599
-Bella, Bella, Bella,
I can't afford the boat.

14:21.730 --> 14:23.210
It's your boat.

14:23.340 --> 14:24.864
I mean, come on.

14:24.994 --> 14:27.649
It's a beautiful boat.
It's worth a lot of money.

14:27.779 --> 14:29.607
I can help you sell it
if that's what you want.

14:29.738 --> 14:32.480
I promise you.

14:32.610 --> 14:35.352
Look, I-I understand
you're probably wondering

14:35.483 --> 14:36.832
what the hell's going on.

14:36.963 --> 14:38.703
You're -- You're --
You're maybe mad at him

14:38.834 --> 14:41.010
and -- and pissed off, and you
don't want anything from him.

14:41.141 --> 14:42.882
But this is his way of
showing you that -- that --

14:43.012 --> 14:44.535
that he cares,
that he loves you.

14:44.666 --> 14:46.581
It's his way of
giving you something.

14:46.711 --> 14:48.844
Bella, take it.

14:51.020 --> 14:53.066
-Fine.
But I'm changing the name.

14:53.196 --> 14:54.676
-Change the name.
-My Little Pony.

14:54.806 --> 14:57.026
My Little Pony.
-I love it. My Little Pony.

14:57.157 --> 14:58.245
This is Captain Lawson.

14:58.375 --> 14:59.986
-Pleasure.
-This is Bella.

15:00.116 --> 15:02.902
-We're changing the name
to My Little Pony.

15:03.032 --> 15:05.861
-My Little Ponyit is.
A pleasure. Nice meeting you.

15:05.992 --> 15:07.819
-Nobody knows the boat
better than him.
-You're in good hands.

15:07.950 --> 15:09.082
-Okay?
-Alright.

15:09.212 --> 15:10.735
-I'm gonna come get you
tomorrow.

15:10.866 --> 15:14.348
We're gonna sign some papers
and we'll take care of it.

15:14.478 --> 15:16.306
-After you.

15:16.437 --> 15:17.960
-I'm here if you need me, Bella.

15:18.091 --> 15:20.006
-Relax.

15:20.136 --> 15:22.356
-Alright.
Keep her away from the water.

15:22.486 --> 15:23.792
-You're gonna need a new shirt.

15:23.923 --> 15:27.056
-So you guys made a change.
-Yeah.

15:51.254 --> 15:53.169
-Here we have the top deck.

15:53.300 --> 15:56.520
Jacuzzi -- We can fill it up
at your discretion.

15:56.651 --> 15:57.826
-Seriously?
-Yes.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.959
Down here, we have the bridge.

16:02.831 --> 16:04.398
By any chance, if you need me,

16:04.528 --> 16:07.183
my cabin is near the radio room
in the lower deck.

16:07.314 --> 16:09.142
-Okay, but do you live here
or...?

16:09.272 --> 16:10.665
-No, I have a house in town.

16:10.795 --> 16:12.188
-Okay. Sorry, I didn't mean
to sound rude.

16:12.319 --> 16:14.364
It's just I definitely
can't afford to --

16:14.495 --> 16:16.453
-Your father paid me
to the end of the year.

16:16.584 --> 16:17.541
He was a great man.

16:17.672 --> 16:19.500
We were in the service together.

16:21.806 --> 16:22.982
Let me show you around.

16:30.250 --> 16:31.555
Impressive, right?
-Yeah.

16:31.686 --> 16:34.645
-Here's a salon,

16:34.776 --> 16:35.995
large room for entertaining.

16:36.125 --> 16:38.388
We have a wet bar,
fully stocked.

16:38.519 --> 16:41.217
Half the stuff here
hasn't even been used.

16:41.348 --> 16:43.263
-I think there's even
a sous vide somewhere.

16:43.393 --> 16:45.091
You cook?

16:45.221 --> 16:48.572
-Can you sous vide Hot Pockets?

16:48.703 --> 16:51.140
-You can try.
-Okay.

16:51.271 --> 16:55.275
-The galley's ahead,
and the master cabin is below.

16:55.405 --> 16:57.538
Follow me.

16:57.668 --> 17:00.062
Watch your step on the way down.

17:00.193 --> 17:04.110
Here is the master cabin.

17:04.240 --> 17:05.850
-Are you kidding me? It's huge.

17:05.981 --> 17:07.417
-Right? It's beautiful,
isn't it?

17:07.548 --> 17:08.853
-Yeah.
-It's all yours.

17:08.984 --> 17:10.725
-This is mine, then? Alright.

17:10.855 --> 17:11.900
-Make yourself at home.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.771
-Ahh.

17:13.902 --> 17:15.208
I can see why people do this.

17:16.687 --> 17:18.950
-Well, unfortunately,

17:19.081 --> 17:21.127
I can't finish the tour.
I got to go.

17:21.257 --> 17:23.259
But, uh, did Ed
check you into the hotel?

17:23.390 --> 17:26.045
-No, but I can just stay here.
-Unfortunately, you can't.

17:26.175 --> 17:28.395
Until you sign the papers,
we got to get the keys back.

17:28.525 --> 17:30.397
The law is very complicated.

17:30.527 --> 17:33.791
Sorry.

17:33.922 --> 17:36.142
You know your way around here?

17:36.272 --> 17:38.709
-No, but I can
figure something out.

17:38.840 --> 17:40.059
-Okay.

18:10.350 --> 18:12.003
-Can I get another?

18:13.875 --> 18:17.487
And, uh, send one
down there too.

18:19.402 --> 18:20.490
-It's on her.

18:20.621 --> 18:22.013
-Keep the change.

18:22.144 --> 18:23.928
-Oh, thanks, girl.

18:24.059 --> 18:28.542
-Thanks.
-Pleasure.

18:28.672 --> 18:32.546
Just came into
a whole lot of money.

18:32.676 --> 18:34.330
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

18:39.814 --> 18:42.556
- Ohh.

18:42.686 --> 18:44.601
- Really?

18:44.732 --> 18:46.255
-Oh, it doesn't get easier.

18:58.572 --> 19:01.444
And yeah, so I've always wanted
to travel the world

19:01.575 --> 19:03.316
and as soon as I could,

19:03.446 --> 19:05.840
I packed my bags
and never went back.

19:05.970 --> 19:09.800
Panama Canal.
Machu Picchu twice.

19:09.931 --> 19:11.976
Uh, Galápagos.

19:12.107 --> 19:15.850
And now good old Mississippi.

19:15.980 --> 19:17.417
-Nice.

19:17.547 --> 19:19.027
-Yeah, but it's not
always beers on the beach

19:19.158 --> 19:20.942
with beautiful women.
-Oh.

19:21.072 --> 19:22.726
No, that doesn't work.
That doesn't work on girls.

19:22.857 --> 19:23.901
Does it really?

19:24.032 --> 19:25.773
-It usually does.

19:25.903 --> 19:29.516
But I guess that means
you're really special.

19:29.646 --> 19:32.171
-Oh, my -- You can't stop.
You can't stop, can you?

19:32.301 --> 19:33.868
No.
-What, that one didn't work?

19:33.998 --> 19:36.000
- No.
- Well, that's my best material,

19:36.131 --> 19:37.350
so I'm done.

19:37.480 --> 19:39.526
I'm done.
-Alright, bar's closed.

19:39.656 --> 19:41.441
-Oh, come on.
-Gotta go.

19:41.571 --> 19:43.225
-Really?
-Yes.

19:43.356 --> 19:44.748
-That's 'cause of all
that shit you were saying.

19:44.879 --> 19:47.403
She's like, "Got to get him
out of here."

19:47.534 --> 19:49.797
-Ahh.

19:49.927 --> 19:52.626
I might know a place we can go.

19:52.756 --> 19:54.976
-Really?
-Yeah.

19:55.106 --> 19:58.719
If you drop the whole
corny pick-up line thing.

19:58.849 --> 20:01.548
-Deal.
-Deal. Let's do it.

20:14.300 --> 20:18.565
-Holy shit.

20:18.695 --> 20:20.393
What?

20:20.523 --> 20:22.612
-Yeah.
-You got a Jacuzzi?

20:22.743 --> 20:26.225
-Apparently, I have a Jacuzzi.
On a yacht.

20:30.229 --> 20:32.448
Your dad just
left you this thing?

20:32.579 --> 20:33.754
-Yup.

20:33.884 --> 20:35.625
And trust me when I say that

20:35.756 --> 20:37.018
that was the least
that he could do.

20:37.148 --> 20:38.628
We were not close.

20:38.759 --> 20:41.196
At all.
-I'm sorry.

20:41.327 --> 20:43.894
-It is fine.

20:44.025 --> 20:46.375
Let me show you the rest.

20:48.812 --> 20:50.118
Down the stairs.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.033
-Spiral stairs.

20:52.163 --> 20:54.862
-Check this out.
This -- This is my room.

20:54.992 --> 20:57.430
-Oh, my God.

20:57.560 --> 20:58.953
-Bigger than anywhere
I ever lived before.

20:59.083 --> 21:02.609
-This is what we call...

21:04.828 --> 21:08.179
a master bedroom.

21:08.310 --> 21:10.007
-That is -- That's --
It is that.

21:10.138 --> 21:13.489
-This is a...

21:13.620 --> 21:17.624
a bathroom that has mirrors
on the ceiling.

21:19.756 --> 21:20.931
Ceiling and the floor.

21:21.062 --> 21:22.498
-Alright, are you done?

21:22.629 --> 21:24.500
Can I -- What are you --
Come on over, you pervert.

21:24.631 --> 21:27.634
Give me this.
Give me my phone back.

21:27.764 --> 21:29.810
Alright.

21:29.940 --> 21:31.202
Oh, hi.

21:31.333 --> 21:34.118
-Oh, hey.
-You gonna take that shirt off?

21:40.124 --> 21:41.691
Damn, you're pretty cute.

21:44.390 --> 21:47.697
Pick-up lines aside.

21:49.395 --> 21:51.092
Come here.

23:13.783 --> 23:15.350
Hey.

23:15.481 --> 23:18.571
Hey, what are you doing
out here?

23:18.701 --> 23:20.573
No one's supposed
to be out here.

23:23.140 --> 23:24.751
Turn around.

23:27.710 --> 23:30.931
-I'm right where
I'm supposed to be.

23:31.061 --> 23:33.673
-Put your hands up.

23:33.803 --> 23:35.501
Hands up, slow.

23:51.778 --> 23:53.910
-Put your fucking mask back on.

27:40.049 --> 27:41.660
Wake up.
-Mm?

27:41.790 --> 27:43.662
-Wake up.
The -- The boat's moving.

27:46.229 --> 27:48.275
-Well, isn't this your boat?
Why is it moving?

27:48.405 --> 27:50.016
-Yeah, I don't know.

27:57.545 --> 28:00.026
Yeah. No, it's -- it's --
it's really moving.

28:54.863 --> 28:57.257
-We got to get off this boat.

28:57.387 --> 28:58.867
Now.

29:08.529 --> 29:10.009
On three.
-On three what?

29:10.139 --> 29:11.358
-We jump.
-Fuck.

29:11.488 --> 29:13.055
No, I can't go overboard.
I can't do that.

29:13.186 --> 29:15.144
-Listen to me, I will help you,
but we have to jump.

29:15.275 --> 29:17.277
-I-I don't swim. I can't swim.
-Fuck.

29:17.407 --> 29:19.758
Alright.

29:19.888 --> 29:22.108
I'm gonna get us help.
I promise.

29:22.238 --> 29:23.849
Okay?

29:53.443 --> 29:54.923
- Stop the boat.

30:01.190 --> 30:02.931
-Come on, come on.

30:08.197 --> 30:10.243
-What the fuck?
What the fuck?

30:16.684 --> 30:18.033
-Come on, come on.

30:21.080 --> 30:22.951
-Someone was on the boat.

30:23.082 --> 30:24.561
-Find him.

30:30.567 --> 30:32.091
-I got him.

30:32.221 --> 30:33.396
-Ready.

30:33.527 --> 30:35.746
-9:00, 50 meters.

30:38.662 --> 30:39.925
To the left.

30:40.055 --> 30:41.448
More left.

30:43.406 --> 30:46.192
-Come on, you can do it,
you can do it.

30:46.322 --> 30:48.324
-Ah, fuck.
-New strategy.

30:48.455 --> 30:50.283
By eye, go to the ladder.

30:53.982 --> 30:56.245
-No target.
-Just wait.

30:59.118 --> 31:01.076
-Come on, come on, come on.

31:01.207 --> 31:02.991
-No target.
God damn it, Sunshine.

31:03.122 --> 31:05.559
-Be ready. Just be ready.

31:05.689 --> 31:08.954
-What's happening?
-Shh. Shut up!

31:09.084 --> 31:10.390
-Guys, what's happening?
What's happening?

31:10.520 --> 31:11.782
-Shut up.

31:16.265 --> 31:18.746
-Target acquired.

31:18.877 --> 31:21.009
-Are -- Are you serious?

31:21.140 --> 31:22.706
-Come on. Come on, come on.

31:22.837 --> 31:24.621
-You can't shoot a gun here.
Everybody's gonna hear it.

31:24.752 --> 31:27.146
-Take the shot.

31:31.628 --> 31:33.021
-Fuck. Fuck.

31:36.503 --> 31:37.896
-Oh, this is not right.

31:38.026 --> 31:40.072
-Shut the fuck up, Captain.

31:40.202 --> 31:42.901
-Ohh.

31:43.031 --> 31:44.250
-Took you long enough.

31:44.380 --> 31:45.947
Dad'd be pissed.

31:46.078 --> 31:47.557
-What did you just say, soldier?

31:47.688 --> 31:51.083
-What?
-Sorry, sir.

31:52.432 --> 31:54.695
-You said nobody was gonna
get hurt.

31:54.825 --> 31:57.306
-Well, I wouldn't go
in the living room if I was you.

31:57.437 --> 31:59.308
-Start the fucking boat.

31:59.439 --> 32:00.919
-Let's go.

32:01.049 --> 32:02.050
-Let's go.

32:02.181 --> 32:04.923
-This is insane.
-Move it.

32:07.708 --> 32:09.753
-Fuck. Shit.

32:43.309 --> 32:45.615
Fuck. Shit, fuck. Oh, my God.

32:58.846 --> 33:01.327
-Okay, Captain,
let's take her out to sea.

33:26.700 --> 33:28.310
-What if he wasn't alone?

33:45.632 --> 33:47.982
-I'll take the upper deck.

33:48.113 --> 33:50.202
You take the lower.

35:49.756 --> 35:52.367
-We need to talk.

35:52.498 --> 35:53.499
Now.

35:55.327 --> 35:57.633
Stay off this Goddamn frequency.

36:59.913 --> 37:02.568
-The hell you gotten me into?

37:02.698 --> 37:04.657
-You knew
what you signed up for,

37:04.787 --> 37:06.572
who we are.

37:06.702 --> 37:09.879
-Gabriel, this kid you shot
with this fucking sniper rifle.

37:10.010 --> 37:12.621
You paid me to pilot the boat,
not kill innocent people, man.

37:12.752 --> 37:14.362
What the hell is going on?
-You're right.

37:14.493 --> 37:17.844
We paid you to pilot the boat,
not to ask questions.

37:17.974 --> 37:20.412
-This is not right.
You know it's not,

37:20.542 --> 37:24.198
-Let's make a deal.
You do your job,

37:24.329 --> 37:26.374
you let me do mine.

37:26.505 --> 37:28.942
We both come out rich
on the other side.

37:29.072 --> 37:30.335
Okay?

38:13.682 --> 38:15.771
- Okay.

38:25.781 --> 38:27.522
What?

38:27.653 --> 38:29.002
Come on.

38:30.308 --> 38:31.570
Shit.

38:49.675 --> 38:51.503
What?

38:53.635 --> 38:55.071
Come on.

38:55.202 --> 38:57.204
Come on.

38:59.598 --> 39:01.861
Great fucking present, Dad.

39:01.991 --> 39:03.515
Come on.

39:11.044 --> 39:13.438
What the hell are you into, Dad?

39:20.445 --> 39:22.360
Alright, come on, come on,
come on.

39:30.716 --> 39:32.544
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

39:40.639 --> 39:42.336
Radio. There's a radio.

39:42.467 --> 39:44.991
Get to the radio. Okay.

40:34.867 --> 40:37.043
-See anything?
-Nothing.

40:37.173 --> 40:39.393
You handle the captain?
-Yep.

40:39.524 --> 40:42.396
-He makes me nervous.
-I'm not worried.

40:42.527 --> 40:44.572
Captain always goes down
with the ship.

40:48.141 --> 40:49.447
-Input the wrong code,

40:49.577 --> 40:51.840
the safe sends a GPS signal
to the cops.

40:55.235 --> 40:58.325
-But you can crack it?

40:58.456 --> 41:00.196
-Code is decentralized.

41:00.327 --> 41:03.591
Pieces of it are on computers
all over the world like Bitcoin.

41:08.596 --> 41:10.293
I'll break it.

41:13.122 --> 41:15.037
The numbers are only one part.

41:15.168 --> 41:17.257
Four mechanical locks.

41:17.387 --> 41:19.302
Easy to get through,

41:19.433 --> 41:21.522
but it'll take time.

41:21.653 --> 41:23.872
And if we get through all those,

41:24.003 --> 41:26.179
we still have
the biometric lock.

41:26.309 --> 41:27.876
-We got that taken care of.

41:31.706 --> 41:33.316
-Careful.

42:03.999 --> 42:06.698
Hey.

42:06.828 --> 42:10.179
-What is it?

42:10.310 --> 42:11.790
-Thought I heard something.

42:15.228 --> 42:16.751
-Let's get our money.

42:29.938 --> 42:31.070
Bolts are down.

42:31.200 --> 42:32.506
-Alright, let me get in here.

42:53.788 --> 42:55.050
-Did it work?

42:58.488 --> 42:59.707
-Let's see.

43:06.627 --> 43:08.368
Looks like it.

43:15.505 --> 43:17.246
You really think it's in there?

43:17.377 --> 43:18.987
-$80 million.

43:19.118 --> 43:20.554
-All $80?

43:20.685 --> 43:23.688
-What the lieutenant says.

43:23.818 --> 43:25.820
-Can we trust him?

43:25.951 --> 43:28.562
-No. That's why we have guns.

43:54.240 --> 43:55.415
-Fuck.

44:46.988 --> 44:49.208
Hello? Hello? Is anyone there?

44:51.863 --> 44:55.344
Hello? Is anyone there?

44:55.475 --> 44:57.825
Hello, anyone? Please.

44:57.956 --> 44:59.348
Coast Guard?

44:59.479 --> 45:00.828
-This is the Coast Guard.

45:00.959 --> 45:02.917
What is the nature
of your distress?

45:03.048 --> 45:04.397
-I need help immediately.

45:09.141 --> 45:10.055
-I'll check.

45:19.368 --> 45:20.805
-I need a rescue now.

45:20.935 --> 45:22.720
-Identification?

45:22.850 --> 45:26.811
-My what?
-Ship identification.

45:26.941 --> 45:29.727
-I have no idea.
-What is your position?

45:29.857 --> 45:31.250
-Uh...

45:31.380 --> 45:33.687
Position, position.

45:33.818 --> 45:35.950
Somewhere in the fucking middle
of the ocean.

45:36.081 --> 45:39.040
-Push the red button.

45:39.171 --> 45:43.436
DSC.

45:43.566 --> 45:46.178
Did you find the button?

45:49.703 --> 45:51.139
-Shit.

45:53.054 --> 45:54.534
There's someone on the boat.
They're in the engine room.

46:34.879 --> 46:37.272
-Coast Guard on the way.

46:37.403 --> 46:38.752
-Shit.

46:45.411 --> 46:48.544
-Did anyone run by?
Did you see anyone?

46:48.675 --> 46:50.938
-No.
-Did you call the Coast Guard?

46:51.069 --> 46:52.853
-No. Why would I --
-Did someone run by?

46:52.984 --> 46:55.116
-No. No, no one ran by.

47:23.318 --> 47:24.711
-Hey.

47:24.842 --> 47:26.844
-We're finally
getting somewhere.

47:29.977 --> 47:31.761
-We have a stowaway.

47:48.561 --> 47:50.041
-We should run.

47:50.171 --> 47:52.347
-Guys, they're locked onto
our GPS.

47:52.478 --> 47:53.609
If we run, they'll catch us.

47:53.740 --> 47:56.221
-Safe's not open. We stay.

47:56.351 --> 48:00.007
-I still say we run.

48:00.138 --> 48:02.923
-We knew this was a possibility,
and we planned for it.

48:03.054 --> 48:05.230
Let's execute that plan.

48:05.360 --> 48:07.362
-Guys, this will never work.

48:07.493 --> 48:09.234
I'm telling you.

48:09.364 --> 48:10.713
-You gonna rat us out
to the Coast Guard?

48:10.844 --> 48:12.628
-No, no. I never said that.

48:12.759 --> 48:14.369
-You think
Heather would like that idea?

48:14.500 --> 48:15.849
-I don't think she would.

48:15.980 --> 48:18.330
-How do you know my wife?
-How about Anna?

48:18.460 --> 48:21.811
-I think she'd
fucking hate that idea.

48:21.942 --> 48:24.814
-Get back to the bridge,
Captain.

48:29.036 --> 48:31.691
-Find them before they get here.

49:43.981 --> 49:45.721
-Fuck.

50:13.140 --> 50:14.794
-Psst.

50:14.924 --> 50:16.361
-What are you doing here?

50:16.491 --> 50:18.363
-Please help me.

50:20.713 --> 50:22.410
-Alright, let me think.

50:22.541 --> 50:24.586
There's an inflatable boat
in the last rivet.

50:24.717 --> 50:28.025
It's in the lower deck.

50:28.155 --> 50:31.028
Launch it at the back
of the ship.

50:31.158 --> 50:33.160
-Lawson.

50:35.075 --> 50:37.034
Lawson.

50:37.164 --> 50:39.210
-Fuck. Run.

50:39.340 --> 50:40.341
Yeah?

50:43.649 --> 50:44.954
Yeah?

50:45.085 --> 50:46.260
-Don't you have
a ship to steer?

50:46.391 --> 50:47.957
-Yeah.

50:48.088 --> 50:49.568
-Did you see him?

50:49.698 --> 50:51.048
-No.
-The stowaway.

50:51.178 --> 50:54.138
-I-I didn't see.

50:54.268 --> 50:56.053
-Let's go.

51:59.203 --> 52:00.856
Here I come.

52:00.987 --> 52:02.597
Ready or not.

52:23.488 --> 52:26.143
Come out, come out
wherever you are.

52:56.564 --> 53:00.002
-We have a Coast Guard problem.

53:00.133 --> 53:01.787
Okay.

53:01.917 --> 53:03.658
-What happens if
the stowaway shows up?

53:03.789 --> 53:05.704
-We kill everyone.

53:05.834 --> 53:06.966
-What?

53:21.546 --> 53:23.591
-Prepare to be boarded.

53:35.473 --> 53:37.170
Where's the captain?

53:40.260 --> 53:41.783
Take me to him.

53:57.451 --> 53:59.888
-Welcome aboard.

54:00.019 --> 54:02.108
-You the captain?
-Yeah.

54:02.239 --> 54:04.719
-And do you know why we're here?

54:04.850 --> 54:06.808
-No, sir, I don't.

54:06.939 --> 54:10.899
-We received a distress call.

54:11.030 --> 54:14.033
-Do we look distressed?

54:14.163 --> 54:17.036
-Any women on board?

54:17.166 --> 54:18.690
-No.

54:45.325 --> 54:47.719
-Little late for a joyride,
isn't it?

54:47.849 --> 54:50.635
-Well, sure you got
the right boat?

54:50.765 --> 54:53.420
-Hey, Captain.
Look what I found.

54:55.683 --> 54:57.076
-What's this?

54:57.206 --> 54:59.470
-Halloween leftover.

55:02.124 --> 55:04.866
-Looks like a disguise to me.

55:04.997 --> 55:06.868
You know, this close to Mexico,

55:06.999 --> 55:11.395
we get a lot of trafficking --
drugs, people.

55:11.525 --> 55:13.397
Women mostly,

55:13.527 --> 55:18.271
but, uh, there's no women
on board, are there?

55:18.402 --> 55:20.273
-No.

55:22.231 --> 55:23.842
-How about we take a look?

55:26.366 --> 55:28.890
-Right this way.
-Search the ship.

57:15.736 --> 57:17.303
-Hey.

57:17.434 --> 57:19.436
Hey. How long
is this gonna take?

57:19.566 --> 57:21.394
-Excuse me?

57:21.525 --> 57:24.005
-Seems like a waste of time, no?
You guys should be done by now.

57:35.843 --> 57:37.410
-Come in, over.

57:37.541 --> 57:40.021
-Vessel in distress 13 miles
from your location.

57:40.152 --> 57:41.893
-I'll get the captain.

57:42.023 --> 57:43.416
-I'll go get him.

57:53.861 --> 57:55.341
-It's off limits.

57:55.472 --> 57:57.561
-Take your hand off me.

57:59.824 --> 58:02.479
-It's the owner's quarters.
-Step aside.

58:02.609 --> 58:04.829
-Not even the crew has --
-Step aside now.

58:04.959 --> 58:06.700
Or there's gonna be a problem.

58:08.963 --> 58:10.574
-Okay.

58:29.549 --> 58:31.812
-Captain.

58:31.943 --> 58:33.205
Captain.

58:33.335 --> 58:34.772
The crew needs you. It's urgent.

59:19.033 --> 59:21.558
-Distress call came in.
Crew says she's taking on water.

59:21.688 --> 59:22.907
-How far?
-13 miles.

59:23.037 --> 59:24.909
-Muster the crew, double time.

59:25.039 --> 59:26.780
You find anything?
-Nothing.

59:34.701 --> 59:36.485
-Have a good night, gentlemen.

1:00:40.419 --> 1:00:41.855
-Hey!

1:01:01.832 --> 1:01:04.399
-Look at that, Captain.
Nobody died.

1:01:04.530 --> 1:01:07.402
Let's get to work.

1:01:07.533 --> 1:01:09.100
We'll deal with
that stowaway later.

1:01:53.492 --> 1:01:55.233
-Show time.

1:01:57.888 --> 1:02:00.281
-You have the recorder?

1:02:00.412 --> 1:02:01.587
-Ready?

1:02:04.764 --> 1:02:07.114
-Arthur Denton.

1:02:19.344 --> 1:02:21.738
-What the fuck is that?

1:02:33.619 --> 1:02:35.273
-I don't know.

1:02:38.189 --> 1:02:40.104
-He said it will be there.

1:02:40.234 --> 1:02:41.932
$80 million in fucking gold.

1:02:42.062 --> 1:02:45.500
What the fuck is this?

1:02:45.631 --> 1:02:48.329
-I'll call him.

1:02:48.460 --> 1:02:50.810
-That son of a bitch.

1:02:50.941 --> 1:02:52.464
He fucked this whole thing up.

1:02:52.594 --> 1:02:55.772
-Hey! Calm down.
Job's not done.

1:02:57.295 --> 1:02:59.340
Set up the C-4
in the engine room.

1:02:59.471 --> 1:03:01.560
-What about the stowaway?

1:03:01.690 --> 1:03:04.128
-Find him. Kill him.

1:03:17.358 --> 1:03:18.795
We have a problem.

1:03:47.040 --> 1:03:50.391
-Get me off this fucking barge.

1:03:50.522 --> 1:03:51.958
-I'll go set up the raft.

1:04:59.069 --> 1:05:00.635
Okay.

1:05:30.404 --> 1:05:32.058
-Why are you doing this, anyway?

1:05:32.189 --> 1:05:34.234
-I need the money.

1:05:34.365 --> 1:05:37.150
-I meant helping me.

1:05:37.281 --> 1:05:38.978
-Your dad did a lot for me
and my family.

1:05:39.109 --> 1:05:41.154
There's something important
I got to get from the bridge.

1:05:41.285 --> 1:05:42.416
Sit tight.
It'll only take a minute, okay?

1:05:42.547 --> 1:05:43.765
-Yeah. Sure. It's not like

1:05:43.896 --> 1:05:45.115
anyone's trying to kill me
or anything.

1:05:45.245 --> 1:05:46.551
Jesus Christ.

1:06:18.844 --> 1:06:20.846
- Oh, God.

1:06:28.201 --> 1:06:29.942
-Jim, is that you?

1:06:49.135 --> 1:06:51.224
Hey, girly girl.

1:06:51.355 --> 1:06:53.096
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1:07:23.126 --> 1:07:24.779
-Where'd you learn
to fight like that?

1:07:24.910 --> 1:07:25.824
-Cell Block H.

1:07:27.304 --> 1:07:29.045
-Let's go.

1:07:51.023 --> 1:07:53.634
What is this?

1:07:53.765 --> 1:07:54.896
You're his girl?

1:07:55.027 --> 1:07:57.073
Artie's kid?

1:07:57.203 --> 1:07:59.379
Jesus, this just got
a whole lot sweeter.

1:08:09.824 --> 1:08:11.522
See, Lawson?

1:08:11.652 --> 1:08:13.263
This is the kid.

1:08:13.393 --> 1:08:15.091
Look him right
in the fucking eye.

1:08:16.788 --> 1:08:18.224
Watch that light go out.

1:08:20.052 --> 1:08:21.836
There it is.

1:08:21.967 --> 1:08:23.360
There it is.

1:08:23.490 --> 1:08:24.926
There it is.

1:08:30.671 --> 1:08:32.586
There it is.

1:08:32.717 --> 1:08:34.936
There it is.

1:08:49.908 --> 1:08:51.910
-Oh, my God.

1:08:57.176 --> 1:08:58.656
-Sunshine.

1:08:58.786 --> 1:09:00.832
Sunshine.

1:09:04.575 --> 1:09:06.403
Sunshine, come in.

1:09:10.058 --> 1:09:11.843
Sunshine, report back.

1:09:15.542 --> 1:09:17.936
I heard a shot.

1:09:18.066 --> 1:09:19.285
I'm coming to you.

1:10:29.050 --> 1:10:30.313
-Bella, get down.

1:10:30.443 --> 1:10:32.967
Get down.

1:10:33.098 --> 1:10:34.055
Stay down.

1:10:34.186 --> 1:10:36.188
I'll get us out of here.

1:10:36.319 --> 1:10:37.494
Stay down.

1:10:37.624 --> 1:10:38.669
Stay down.

1:10:43.978 --> 1:10:45.502
Oh!

1:10:47.808 --> 1:10:48.983
Stay down.

1:10:55.076 --> 1:10:55.903
Fuck.

1:10:56.034 --> 1:10:57.253
I think we're okay.

1:11:10.831 --> 1:11:13.007
-New problem.

1:11:27.805 --> 1:11:30.111
-Hey, you alright? You okay?
-Yeah.

1:11:36.901 --> 1:11:38.642
-Hey.
-Ow.

1:11:41.558 --> 1:11:45.126
I think the fuel's out.

1:11:45.257 --> 1:11:47.172
We should wait till daylight.

1:11:47.303 --> 1:11:49.305
Probably just rest till then.

1:11:53.309 --> 1:11:54.310
-I'm gonna take the gun, okay?

1:11:54.440 --> 1:11:56.094
-Yeah.

1:12:09.194 --> 1:12:11.152
Busy night, huh?

1:12:17.637 --> 1:12:19.900
Oh, God.

1:12:59.200 --> 1:13:00.767
Look.

1:13:27.141 --> 1:13:29.927
That's Anna. She's 12.

1:13:31.885 --> 1:13:34.410
-She's really beautiful.

1:13:39.023 --> 1:13:40.720
She's sick.

1:13:43.549 --> 1:13:45.595
Doctors don't know what it is.

1:13:51.252 --> 1:13:53.124
And the test was so expensive.

1:13:56.519 --> 1:13:58.216
-She's why you did all this.

1:13:58.346 --> 1:13:59.957
-Bella, she's everything.

1:14:00.087 --> 1:14:02.699
Your father was helping us
pay for the treatments.

1:14:06.659 --> 1:14:09.662
He was a good man.

1:14:09.793 --> 1:14:11.969
-So you keep telling me.

1:14:14.537 --> 1:14:15.886
-Hey, have you, uh,

1:14:16.016 --> 1:14:18.192
you ever heard
of companies like

1:14:18.323 --> 1:14:21.979
Blackwater, Titan, Arcana?

1:14:26.418 --> 1:14:28.115
-W-What is this?

1:14:31.379 --> 1:14:34.644
-Civilian contractors
in destabilized war zones

1:14:34.774 --> 1:14:36.689
like Syria and Afghanistan.

1:14:36.820 --> 1:14:38.909
Your father owned Arcana.

1:14:39.039 --> 1:14:41.825
He had contracts in Kabul.

1:14:41.955 --> 1:14:43.304
Things he had to do,

1:14:43.435 --> 1:14:45.829
the shit he'd seen, Bella,
it ate him up.

1:14:53.271 --> 1:14:56.361
Some of his mercenaries
killed off a warlord in Afghan.

1:14:56.492 --> 1:14:59.582
Killed his wife,
killed their kids,

1:14:59.712 --> 1:15:01.497
took $80 million.

1:15:01.627 --> 1:15:04.064
$80 million.

1:15:04.195 --> 1:15:06.502
Your father stole it back
and went on the run.

1:15:10.375 --> 1:15:14.161
And get this --
he gave it all away.

1:15:14.292 --> 1:15:16.381
To people who needed saving.

1:15:16.512 --> 1:15:19.210
Like my Anna. Like you.

1:15:26.217 --> 1:15:27.435
-I had no idea.

1:15:27.566 --> 1:15:29.220
-Oh, Bella --

1:15:29.350 --> 1:15:32.571
He was a good man, Bella.

1:15:32.702 --> 1:15:33.964
He was so proud of you.

1:15:34.094 --> 1:15:37.489
Hey, when you graduated college,
my God.

1:15:37.620 --> 1:15:39.839
Bennington, right?

1:15:39.970 --> 1:15:41.537
-Yeah.

1:15:41.667 --> 1:15:44.278
-He said, you, uh -- He used to
tell me me you cut off

1:15:44.409 --> 1:15:46.629
the sleeves of your gown
to show off some of your ink.

1:15:46.759 --> 1:15:50.807
I always got a kick out of that.
Thought it was badass.

1:15:50.937 --> 1:15:54.637
-I, uh -- I didn't even know
that he was there.

1:15:54.767 --> 1:15:56.073
-He loved you.

1:15:56.203 --> 1:15:59.511
Even from the shadows.

1:16:09.303 --> 1:16:11.262
-Someone's coming.

1:16:13.394 --> 1:16:15.135
Hey!
-Hey, we don't know who that is.

1:16:15.266 --> 1:16:17.921
-Why, what does it matter?
You need help.

1:16:18.051 --> 1:16:21.054
-Jesus Christ, at least --
at least hide the gun.

1:16:21.185 --> 1:16:22.752
-Over here!

1:16:25.189 --> 1:16:28.235
We need help!

1:16:28.366 --> 1:16:30.281
They're coming.
They're coming.

1:16:37.549 --> 1:16:39.943
-Ohh, I don't know
if I'm gonna make it.

1:16:40.073 --> 1:16:41.509
-Yes, you are.

1:16:43.947 --> 1:16:45.601
Ohh.

1:16:55.436 --> 1:16:58.222
-Ed, thank God you're here.

1:17:01.486 --> 1:17:02.835
-You okay?

1:17:02.966 --> 1:17:06.709
-You won't believe
what happened on the boat.

1:17:06.839 --> 1:17:08.319
-You alright?

1:17:16.240 --> 1:17:18.546
-I always knew
you were gonna kill me.

1:17:55.932 --> 1:17:58.499
-I want to kill her.
-Don't kill her yet.

1:18:10.686 --> 1:18:14.037
Ohh, Bella, Bella, Bella.

1:18:14.167 --> 1:18:16.779
Alright, come up here.

1:18:16.909 --> 1:18:18.781
Oh, I think I might have --

1:18:18.911 --> 1:18:20.347
-Oh, easy, easy.

1:18:20.478 --> 1:18:22.436
Come on, come on, Bella.

1:18:22.567 --> 1:18:25.831
I think I got
a little rambunctious.

1:18:25.962 --> 1:18:29.269
I didn't mean to hit you
so hard there, Bella.

1:18:29.400 --> 1:18:30.967
You okay?

1:18:31.097 --> 1:18:33.447
Ah, don't touch it.
Don't touch it.

1:18:33.578 --> 1:18:35.493
Because my mother used to say

1:18:35.623 --> 1:18:37.713
if you touch it,
it doesn't heal.

1:18:45.242 --> 1:18:47.418
-Bella.

1:18:47.548 --> 1:18:50.073
Bella, Bella,
Bella, Bella, Bella.

1:18:50.203 --> 1:18:52.684
Where did it go wrong?

1:18:58.255 --> 1:19:00.605
-Mm?
-When you stole my fucking boat.

1:19:03.434 --> 1:19:05.001
I love this kid.

1:19:05.131 --> 1:19:06.480
Your boat.

1:19:06.611 --> 1:19:07.873
Bella, the only reason
why you got the boat

1:19:08.004 --> 1:19:09.179
is 'cause your backstabbing

1:19:09.309 --> 1:19:11.398
piece of shit father
stole my money.

1:19:13.879 --> 1:19:16.099
It's supposed to be
in that safe, Bella.

1:19:16.229 --> 1:19:17.709
80 million fucking dollars.

1:19:17.840 --> 1:19:20.451
Know what I found?
I found this.

1:19:24.803 --> 1:19:26.239
This necklace.

1:19:26.370 --> 1:19:27.763
I mean, it's nice,

1:19:27.893 --> 1:19:29.808
but I don't think
it's worth $80 million.

1:19:29.939 --> 1:19:31.027
Do you?

1:19:34.682 --> 1:19:35.901
-I want to kill her.

1:19:36.032 --> 1:19:39.035
-Jim, I'm talking.

1:19:50.698 --> 1:19:52.918
So now what?
Plan is fucking ruined.

1:19:53.049 --> 1:19:54.572
We were gonna blow the boat up,
get rid of the evidence.

1:19:54.702 --> 1:19:57.967
Can't do that now.

1:19:58.097 --> 1:20:00.143
What do I do?
Sell it on the black market?

1:20:00.273 --> 1:20:02.275
Maybe get 10 cents
on the dollar?

1:20:02.406 --> 1:20:06.758
I mean, that's a big pain
in my ass, Bella.

1:20:06.889 --> 1:20:10.327
Or you can tell me
where the money is.

1:20:10.457 --> 1:20:12.546
Hmm?
Tell me where the money is.

1:20:12.677 --> 1:20:15.027
Where's the money?
Where's the money?

1:20:15.158 --> 1:20:18.465
80 million bucks.
We'll split it three ways.

1:20:18.596 --> 1:20:20.163
Come on.

1:20:20.293 --> 1:20:21.555
-Your friend's
on a different page.

1:20:21.686 --> 1:20:22.687
He just said
he was gonna kill me.

1:20:22.818 --> 1:20:24.254
-Oh, he's not gonna kill you.

1:20:24.384 --> 1:20:26.386
This is what I'm talking about.
Leverage, right?

1:20:26.517 --> 1:20:28.258
This is negotiating 101.

1:20:28.388 --> 1:20:30.303
I keep telling you, man,
you got to relax.

1:20:30.434 --> 1:20:32.088
Easy with the steroids.

1:20:32.218 --> 1:20:34.525
Hey. Hey.

1:20:34.655 --> 1:20:36.309
He's not gonna kill you.

1:20:39.747 --> 1:20:41.445
-Where's the money?

1:20:45.101 --> 1:20:48.713
-You're a fucking monster.

1:20:48.844 --> 1:20:50.149
-I'm not.

1:20:52.282 --> 1:20:53.936
I'm just a product
of your father

1:20:54.066 --> 1:20:57.591
because he told me everything
that I know

1:20:57.722 --> 1:21:00.812
'cause we were partners, Bella.

1:21:00.943 --> 1:21:04.294
-You're nothing like my dad.

1:21:04.424 --> 1:21:05.730
He helped people.

1:21:05.861 --> 1:21:07.601
-He was a thief with no honor.

1:21:07.732 --> 1:21:10.691
Bella, your father was a thief
with no honor.

1:21:10.822 --> 1:21:12.563
I loved him like a brother.

1:21:14.782 --> 1:21:16.436
-He stole my fucking money.

1:21:16.567 --> 1:21:18.308
My money.

1:21:18.438 --> 1:21:21.572
Not his
and not your fucking money.

1:21:21.702 --> 1:21:23.400
Bella.

1:21:25.315 --> 1:21:27.099
I mean, what were you
fucking thinking?

1:21:27.230 --> 1:21:30.233
All you had to do was wake up
in your hotel room and say,

1:21:30.363 --> 1:21:36.195
"Oh, my God, my boat. It's gone.
Has anyone seen my boat?"

1:21:36.326 --> 1:21:42.114
10 million bucks, insurance,
on your way.

1:21:42.245 --> 1:21:43.986
10 million bucks
you would have got.

1:21:44.116 --> 1:21:47.337
Would have been fine.
But no. Here we are.

1:21:47.467 --> 1:21:50.731
Best thing is to hope
for an easy and painless death.

1:21:50.862 --> 1:21:52.472
Unlike your father.

1:21:52.603 --> 1:21:54.083
- You said he fucking drowned.

1:21:54.213 --> 1:21:55.911
-Whoa.

1:21:56.041 --> 1:21:57.216
Bella.

1:21:57.347 --> 1:21:58.957
Bella, Bella, Bella, easy.

1:21:59.088 --> 1:22:00.480
-You said he drowned.

1:22:00.611 --> 1:22:02.961
-Maybe he drowned.

1:22:03.092 --> 1:22:04.180
Maybe.

1:22:05.964 --> 1:22:08.053
-I mean,
he did beg for his life.

1:22:09.881 --> 1:22:12.144
He begged for your life, too,
and I said I wouldn't hurt you.

1:22:12.275 --> 1:22:15.104
Now you made a fucking liar
out of me, Bella.

1:22:19.195 --> 1:22:20.892
So.

1:22:26.332 --> 1:22:28.944
Either you tell me
where the money is.

1:22:29.074 --> 1:22:33.165
Or -- Or I'm gonna let Jim here
do exactly what he said

1:22:33.296 --> 1:22:35.167
he's gonna do to you
with that drill.

1:22:35.298 --> 1:22:37.039
-I want to drill her eye out.

1:22:37.169 --> 1:22:40.259
-He wants to drill your eye out,
apparently.

1:22:40.390 --> 1:22:42.392
Pretty eyes.

1:22:45.221 --> 1:22:49.312
-When you took my gun,
did you take my notebook?

1:22:53.751 --> 1:22:55.535
-Was there a notebook?

1:22:55.666 --> 1:22:57.320
Was there a notebook?!

1:23:00.932 --> 1:23:02.978
See, now we're getting
somewhere, Bella.

1:23:03.108 --> 1:23:04.675
Now we're getting somewhere.

1:23:10.594 --> 1:23:12.900
Isn't this better?

1:23:13.031 --> 1:23:15.991
It's the last page.

1:23:19.820 --> 1:23:22.649
Columns.

1:23:22.780 --> 1:23:26.001
Numbers.

1:23:26.131 --> 1:23:29.091
Tell me, Ed.

1:23:29.221 --> 1:23:31.267
What does that last number say?

1:23:33.443 --> 1:23:35.836
Zero.

1:23:35.967 --> 1:23:38.274
He gave it all away.

1:23:38.404 --> 1:23:40.102
You get nothing.

1:23:46.195 --> 1:23:48.153
You get fucking nothing!

1:23:50.286 --> 1:23:53.245
-$80 million, gone?

1:23:56.944 --> 1:23:58.859
-First I'm gonna kill her,
then I'm going to kill you.

1:23:58.990 --> 1:24:00.687
-Hey, Jim.
-Shit.

1:24:00.818 --> 1:24:02.733
-You got to stop telling people
you're gonna kill them.

1:24:07.129 --> 1:24:08.086
Ahh.

1:24:18.531 --> 1:24:20.142
Bella!

1:24:22.883 --> 1:24:24.537
Bella!

1:24:24.668 --> 1:24:25.799
Hey, Bella.

1:24:28.411 --> 1:24:29.629
Bella.

1:24:32.502 --> 1:24:36.071
Come on, Bella.
There's nowhere to go.

1:24:36.201 --> 1:24:38.464
I wish this would have
ended differently.

1:24:41.598 --> 1:24:43.078
It's over.

1:24:47.212 --> 1:24:48.909
You're not gonna jump.

1:24:51.303 --> 1:24:54.698
You're not gonna do it.
You're afraid.

1:24:54.828 --> 1:24:57.309
You're afraid of the water.
You're not gonna jump.

1:24:57.440 --> 1:25:00.399
Bella.

1:25:00.530 --> 1:25:02.227
You're not gonna do it.

1:25:04.969 --> 1:25:06.318
Be--

1:25:27.296 --> 1:25:28.514
-Fuck.

1:26:06.204 --> 1:26:07.292
- Bella.

1:26:13.690 --> 1:26:16.083
Bella, wake up.

1:26:21.045 --> 1:26:23.917
Wake up, Bella.

1:26:24.048 --> 1:26:26.181
Wake up, Bella. I've got you.

1:26:30.576 --> 1:26:32.839
It's okay, Bella. I've got you.

1:26:32.970 --> 1:26:34.276
I've got you, Bella.

1:27:16.013 --> 1:27:18.363
-We got her!

1:27:21.801 --> 1:27:24.587
-You okay?

1:27:24.717 --> 1:27:29.635
-Yeah, uh...How did you know...?

1:27:29.766 --> 1:27:33.465
-We got a call from some Michael
in the hospital.

1:27:33.596 --> 1:27:35.902
Sounded real worried.

1:27:36.033 --> 1:27:39.689
-He said he would get help.

1:27:39.819 --> 1:27:42.213
-I didn't think we were gonna
get back here in time.

1:27:52.876 --> 1:27:55.270
Looks like you can
handle yourself okay.

1:27:57.359 --> 1:27:59.274
Let's get you home.

1:28:53.240 --> 1:28:55.286
Sure you want to do this?

1:28:55.417 --> 1:28:57.375
I mean, I can think
of a lot more things to do

1:28:57.506 --> 1:28:59.334
with $10.2 million
in insurance --

1:28:59.464 --> 1:29:03.250
-I'm sure. I'm sure.

1:29:03.381 --> 1:29:04.469
-Alright.

1:29:27.057 --> 1:29:28.885
Alright, well...

1:29:30.974 --> 1:29:32.105
Where to next?

1:29:32.236 --> 1:29:33.716
-No idea. Wait.

1:29:33.846 --> 1:29:35.631
You ever been to Machu Picchu?

1:29:35.761 --> 1:29:37.546
Let's go. Come on.

1:30:04.877 --> 1:30:08.185
-Anna?

1:30:08.315 --> 1:30:09.795
Are you expecting something?

1:30:12.102 --> 1:30:13.625
-No, Mom.

1:30:38.607 --> 1:30:40.043
Come on.

1:30:52.664 --> 1:30:55.188
-Oh, and I didn't give
all the money away.

1:30:55.319 --> 1:30:57.060
I'm not an idiot.
