Previously on the "Secret Life
of the American Teenager"...

00:03.377 --> 00:06.321
I'd like to know why I got a bill
from the insurance company for Amy

00:06.322 --> 00:09.266
when I know for a fact she's at least
six months overdue for her physical.

00:09.301 --> 00:11.340
My clothes no longer
fit because I'm fat.

00:11.375 --> 00:13.344
I've kissed her, but I
really wanna kiss her.

00:13.379 --> 00:16.870
How old will you be when you stop letting
your parents make your decisions for you?

00:16.905 --> 00:18.196
You're very smart.

00:18.231 --> 00:21.909
Don't go spreading that around.
Might ruin my reputation.

00:21.944 --> 00:24.552
Dr. Hightower has a new
doctor in the office.

00:24.587 --> 00:26.086
Grace Bowman's dad.

00:26.121 --> 00:28.650
I wanna date Jack. Please.

00:28.685 --> 00:30.925
You haven't told her
or your dad, have you?

00:30.960 --> 00:32.012
No.

00:32.048 --> 00:34.776
- You love this girl, I can see it.
- I do.

00:34.811 --> 00:36.759
- What's going on?
- You tell me.

00:36.812 --> 00:39.428
OK, then drop her off
and come back over here.

00:39.463 --> 00:42.045
- I can't do that.
- Are you having a baby?

00:42.651 --> 00:44.014
Yeah.

00:44.049 --> 00:46.030
I forgot to do this.

00:54.670 --> 00:56.126
Phone.

01:01.102 --> 01:02.128
Yeah.

01:02.163 --> 01:05.164
Ricky? Hey, are you still picking me up?

01:07.051 --> 01:10.250
- I'll be right there.
- If you could hurry. I'm here by myself.

01:10.285 --> 01:13.628
- Where's Jack?
- He had curfew. He had to leave.

01:13.663 --> 01:15.925
Yeah. Don't panic. I'm on the way.

01:16.659 --> 01:19.561
Gimme my shirt. I gotta go. I
told you not to let me go to sleep.

01:19.596 --> 01:22.252
- It's my fault you fall asleep?
- My shirt.

01:22.287 --> 01:25.424
Can't she just get a taxi or
something? Or just grow up and tell

01:25.425 --> 01:28.562
her parents that she's dating
Jack whether they like it or not?

01:28.597 --> 01:30.966
Adrian, come on. I gotta go.

01:33.971 --> 01:36.864
- Fine, I'll go without my shirt.
- OK.

01:38.206 --> 01:40.198
I'll give it to you.

01:43.244 --> 01:46.663
On second thought, I think I'll keep it.

01:46.698 --> 01:48.004
All right.

Hey, I could use a little cheerin' up.

02:08.997 --> 02:10.285
What's your name, little girl?

02:10.320 --> 02:14.135
Who you waiting for honey? You
want a ride? We'll give you a ride.

02:14.461 --> 02:16.540
Gotta give us a ride first.

02:17.957 --> 02:19.769
I'm calling the police.

02:20.490 --> 02:22.974
You're not calling anyone, are you?

02:34.491 --> 02:36.913
What the hell's going on here?

02:42.906 --> 02:44.810
You OK?

03:11.168 --> 03:15.257
<i>If you're just joining us for the
morning news, you have to see this one.</i>

03:15.292 --> 03:17.649
<i>Guards at a neighborhood bank were</i>

03:17.650 --> 03:20.007
<i>surprised to find this
footage this morning,</i>

03:20.042 --> 03:22.536
<i>I bet a lot of people
are going to be surprised.</i>

03:22.571 --> 03:24.466
<i>Including that guy's wife, probably.</i>

03:24.501 --> 03:26.435
<i>What do you think is the backstory here?</i>

03:26.470 --> 03:29.898
<i>No one's identified
her yet, but if we run</i>

03:29.899 --> 03:31.754
<i>this a few more times,
I'm sure someone will.</i>

03:31.789 --> 03:33.713
<i>Obviously we have the high school.</i>

03:33.748 --> 03:37.135
<i>- All we need is the yearbook.
- Tried that. She must be a freshman.</i>

03:37.170 --> 03:41.789
<i>- I wonder what church she goes to.
- I wonder what church he goes to.</i>

03:41.824 --> 03:43.100
<i>Look at him.</i>

03:43.135 --> 03:45.296
<i>Makes me wanna go back
to high school again.</i>

03:45.346 --> 03:48.822
<i>When did you get out of
high school, last year?</i>

03:59.067 --> 04:01.591
Get up. Come on, you gotta see this.

04:01.592 --> 04:04.593
They're gonna talk about it at
school all day, I guarantee it.

04:07.166 --> 04:09.338
- OK.
- Hurry.

04:18.382 --> 04:21.117
<i>Now I'm not knocking
anyone else's religion</i>

04:21.118 --> 04:23.852
<i>when I say this, but
whatever hers is, it works.</i>

04:24.705 --> 04:26.698
<i>Aw, come on. Let's see it again.</i>

04:26.733 --> 04:28.973
<i>- Should we show it again?
- Show it again.</i>

04:29.105 --> 04:30.021
Just show it.

04:30.056 --> 04:32.241
<i>Cheerleaders have changed
a lot since my day.</i>

04:32.334 --> 04:33.339
You cannot believe.

04:33.374 --> 04:36.563
<i>Naw, Jimbo. They didn't have
security cameras back then.</i>

04:36.598 --> 04:39.500
<i>Wait, this is my favorite part.</i>

04:39.535 --> 04:42.099
<i>Oh, come on. The best part's the prayer.</i>

04:42.134 --> 04:44.333
<i>- You go to church.
- No.</i>

04:44.707 --> 04:47.606
<i>I might start now if that's what
they're preaching these days.</i>

04:47.641 --> 04:50.408
<i>I might even go to a
high-school football game.</i>

04:50.443 --> 04:52.516
Oh, man. Little Miss Goodie Two Shoes

04:52.517 --> 04:54.589
threatening to cut a
guy with a beer bottle.

04:54.624 --> 04:56.969
And she's out with some
shirtless moron at midnight

04:56.970 --> 04:59.350
in some skeevy part of
town. Don't you love it?

04:59.689 --> 05:01.314
Why would I love it?

05:01.631 --> 05:05.064
'Cause we're family. You gotta dislike
who I dislike. That's called loyalty.

05:05.099 --> 05:08.284
I dislike the Bowmans, so this
is funny to me and to our family.

05:08.319 --> 05:11.076
OK. I don't dislike Grace
Bowman. I don't know her.

05:11.111 --> 05:14.820
Yeah, well, I do. I know her mother,
anyway. That's why this is funny.

05:15.738 --> 05:17.867
Tables have turned, huh?

05:17.902 --> 05:22.026
These two high-falutin' churchgoers
have a little problem child.

05:22.685 --> 05:25.582
Who's that shirtless guy?
I've seen him somewhere.

05:25.617 --> 05:28.444
Oh, uh, I don't know.
W- Why would I know that?

05:28.479 --> 05:32.032
OK. It's all right. No
pressure to identify the guy.

05:32.806 --> 05:37.551
- You sure you don't know?
- Uh... uh, I'm not sure.

05:40.316 --> 05:43.797
Oh, he's, uh, he's just-just
some kid in the band.

05:43.832 --> 05:48.315
OK, OK. You weren't with them in
the skeevy part of town, were ya?

05:48.350 --> 05:49.957
No.

05:50.858 --> 05:53.814
OK, gotta get ready for school.

05:54.205 --> 05:57.364
Thank you, Dad, for, uh, the laugh.

05:57.612 --> 05:59.641
I'm a loving father.

06:04.798 --> 06:06.987
What's with the nun's outfit?

06:07.216 --> 06:09.492
You better not be up to
something, young lady.

06:09.527 --> 06:11.768
- I have a court appearance.
- A court appearance?

06:11.803 --> 06:14.321
- Joking.
- More like lying.

06:14.356 --> 06:17.178
- What are you lying about?
- Nothing.

06:17.213 --> 06:18.833
- Are you on drugs?
- No.

06:18.868 --> 06:21.862
- Why can't I get a straight answer?
- Why can't you tell me I look nice?

06:21.897 --> 06:23.159
See?

06:23.341 --> 06:26.899
Ah, oh, the eye roll. Perfect.
Well, that's more like it.

06:29.342 --> 06:31.607
<i>Please, just one more time.</i>

06:31.642 --> 06:34.891
<i>There are more important
things going on in the world,</i>

06:34.892 --> 06:38.140
<i>like Iraq, Iran, Pakistan,
the build up of Al-qaeda.</i>

06:39.050 --> 06:41.454
<i>Hah, what the heck?
One more time.</i>

06:41.489 --> 06:43.044
<i>Ha. Thanks, Jimbo.</i>

06:43.079 --> 06:45.903
<i>Wait, this is my favorite part.</i>

06:45.938 --> 06:48.428
<i>Oh, come on, the best part's the prayer.</i>

06:48.463 --> 06:51.536
Mom and Dad's gonna be surprised.

06:51.571 --> 06:53.278
Yeah, they are.

06:53.313 --> 06:54.489
- You know...
- I can explain.

06:54.524 --> 06:58.324
- you're a hero.
- No, I'm not a hero. I'm in big trouble.

06:58.634 --> 07:02.648
You're a hero, and
you're in big trouble.

07:02.683 --> 07:06.662
What happened to Ricky's
shirt? He's topless.

07:06.697 --> 07:08.753
- I don't know.
- He's bad.

07:08.788 --> 07:10.703
No, he isn't. I'm bad.

07:10.738 --> 07:14.557
I should never have threatened anyone.
I don't know what I was thinking.

07:14.592 --> 07:17.607
Please, please do not say
anything to Mom and Dad.

07:17.642 --> 07:19.913
They are still going to find out.

07:19.948 --> 07:21.998
- Maybe not.
- Yes, they are.

07:22.033 --> 07:24.049
OK, fine, but let me tell them.

07:24.084 --> 07:25.384
Let me tell them.

07:25.419 --> 07:27.518
No you can't 'cause you
don't know what happened.

07:27.553 --> 07:28.998
Yes, I do.

07:29.033 --> 07:33.907
No, you only know what you saw.
I can explain. I'll explain.

07:34.375 --> 07:37.063
You have to let me explain.

07:48.279 --> 07:50.728
Grace Kathleen Bowman!

07:50.925 --> 07:53.458
BIBLICAL BABE BATTLES BAD BOYS

07:54.451 --> 07:57.103
You know George is gonna put
this in a frame and send it to me.

07:57.138 --> 07:59.962
You're concerned about what
George is gonna think. Great.

07:59.997 --> 08:02.671
Grace, get down here!

08:05.325 --> 08:07.193
I can explain...

08:09.019 --> 08:10.907
...Daddy.

08:12.171 --> 08:13.620
So where was your shirt?

08:13.655 --> 08:15.381
She called me from a street corner.

08:15.416 --> 08:17.599
She had a fight with her
boyfriend or something.

08:17.634 --> 08:19.785
And you didn't have
time to put on a shirt?

08:19.820 --> 08:21.827
She was on a street corner.

08:21.862 --> 08:25.396
I don't remember hearing you leave
our house in the middle of the night.

08:25.431 --> 08:28.989
And I don't remember your coming
home earlier from your appointment.

08:29.024 --> 08:32.548
Now, there's a lot of coming and
going without anyone seeing you.

08:32.582 --> 08:35.495
Do you have an invisibility
formula or something?

08:35.530 --> 08:37.116
No. I was just quiet.

08:37.152 --> 08:40.063
So you quietly slipped
out of bed without

08:40.065 --> 08:42.977
a shirt on to rescue
a damsel in distress?

08:43.011 --> 08:48.421
Yeah. I didn't know she
was gonna... shank a guy.

08:49.319 --> 08:52.171
- It's kinda funny.
- Is it?

08:53.722 --> 08:56.796
I didn't know I was gonna be on
camera, or I would've worn a shirt.

08:56.831 --> 08:59.304
- Really?
- Maybe not.

08:59.339 --> 09:01.778
You know what I think?

09:02.960 --> 09:05.745
I think you weren't at home.

09:05.780 --> 09:11.478
I think you were somewhere else without
your shirt on when you got that call.

09:11.513 --> 09:14.669
- I'm thinking girlfriend.
- Who?

09:14.704 --> 09:17.145
- Amy Juergens.
- Where'd you hear that?

09:17.180 --> 09:20.782
I hear a lot of things. I'm a
social worker. I'm very social.

09:20.817 --> 09:23.414
I am not dating Amy
Juergens. I've never been out

09:23.415 --> 09:26.011
with Amy Juergens, expect
one night at band camp.

09:26.046 --> 09:28.260
That wasn't even a
date. We just hung out.

09:28.295 --> 09:30.323
Hung out or hooked up?

09:30.358 --> 09:32.316
Please, she's, like, 12.

09:32.351 --> 09:35.897
OK, so what about the
majorette... Adrian?

09:35.932 --> 09:38.096
- Adrian?
- I hear a lot.

09:38.131 --> 09:42.572
I'm very social, and I know
everything, sooner or later.

09:42.607 --> 09:45.426
No more questions, OK?
I feel like I'm in court.

09:45.461 --> 09:50.448
I imagine more than a few people are
gonna be asking you questions today.

09:51.941 --> 09:53.206
Mom, make him stop.

09:53.241 --> 09:54.727
Tell your mother why
you're dressed like that.

09:54.762 --> 09:57.472
- Dressed like what?
- Not like you're usually dressed.

09:57.507 --> 09:59.168
- Is it a costume?
- No.

09:59.203 --> 10:01.749
- You didn't suddenly get religious?
- No.

10:01.784 --> 10:04.609
Then what is it? You can tell us.

10:09.543 --> 10:12.935
Oh, no. You're not having sex, are you?

10:12.970 --> 10:16.902
Sex? Her? Isn't that the
opposite of having sex? Are you?

10:16.937 --> 10:18.754
And who would I be having sex with?

10:18.789 --> 10:21.250
Never mind. Just answer the question.

10:21.285 --> 10:23.172
Ashley, your father heard a rumor.

10:23.207 --> 10:25.025
There were two women in the store...

10:25.060 --> 10:28.263
They couldn't be talking
about Amy. Or you, either.

10:28.298 --> 10:31.812
You cannot have sex. Neither can your
sister. I thought I made that clear.

10:32.268 --> 10:35.416
- Ashley, are you having sex?
- I said she wasn't.

10:35.451 --> 10:38.314
Customers in your store
heard I'm having sex?

10:38.349 --> 10:40.411
How would they know I'm having sex?

10:40.446 --> 10:42.474
The only person who knows is me...

10:43.602 --> 10:45.665
and my lover.

10:46.409 --> 10:49.366
Oh. She's lying. You better
be lying. You're 12 years old.

10:49.401 --> 10:52.366
- 13.
- Oh, God.

11:05.867 --> 11:07.432
It made me wanna be a Christian.

11:07.467 --> 11:09.243
Really, maybe we could
go to church this Sunday.

11:09.278 --> 11:12.679
Imagine kneeling down in prayer
and then... whack. Amazing.

11:12.714 --> 11:15.873
Yeah, amazing. I need to
find Madison and Lauren.

11:15.908 --> 11:17.715
I have to tell them something.

11:17.750 --> 11:19.889
Something you can't
tell me, your boyfriend?

11:19.924 --> 11:22.286
- Yeah.
- Is everything OK?

11:22.321 --> 11:23.331
Yeah.

11:23.531 --> 11:27.075
I'm waxing on and on about Grace
Bowman like I have a crush on her.

11:27.110 --> 11:30.619
Grace Bowman means nothing to
me. Really, it was a funny image.

11:30.984 --> 11:32.048
Mm, hysterical.

11:32.083 --> 11:35.325
OK, I've talked about this way
too much. Not just way too much.

11:35.360 --> 11:37.988
A tremendous amount too much.

11:38.023 --> 11:40.304
Heh. But, hey, who knew
she was seeing Ricky?

11:40.339 --> 11:42.550
Oh, I have to go, but
I'll talk to you later, OK?

11:42.585 --> 11:46.526
No, no, no. Please don't go if
you're angry with me. I can't take it.

11:46.561 --> 11:49.931
Ben, I'm not angry. I promise.
I just... I have to go.

11:49.966 --> 11:52.784
OK, well, if you're not angry
with me, then tell me what

11:52.785 --> 11:55.603
you're not telling me, but
you're telling your girlfriends.

11:55.638 --> 11:58.016
Is it that Ricky and
Grace are dating and Ricky

11:58.017 --> 12:00.395
had his shirt off, so
maybe the two of them are...

12:00.817 --> 12:03.309
You still have a thing for
Ricky Ticky Rum-Pum-Pum-Pum?

12:03.344 --> 12:05.505
No, I don't, and I never did.

12:05.540 --> 12:07.666
I think you did at one time.

12:08.120 --> 12:09.712
Uh, snap.

12:12.792 --> 12:14.409
Bye.

12:16.664 --> 12:18.918
Oh, books are hard.

12:19.691 --> 12:21.279
You need any help with your studies?

12:21.314 --> 12:22.761
I hear you got lots of cash.

12:22.796 --> 12:24.174
I do OK with schoolwork.

12:24.209 --> 12:26.745
Yeah, well, you can always do better.

12:31.545 --> 12:32.594
Aspirin?

12:32.629 --> 12:35.207
Not unless it helps cure idiocy.

12:35.242 --> 12:37.596
- I can't believe I did that.
- What now?

12:37.631 --> 12:40.332
First, I go on and on about
that action-hero cheerleader,

12:40.367 --> 12:42.556
Grace Bowman, forgetting
that they have some sort

12:42.557 --> 12:44.746
of weird history of
unspoken competition.

12:44.781 --> 12:48.611
Then I accuse Amy of still
having a thing for Ricky.

12:49.152 --> 12:53.023
I should've never kissed her.
Now I'm afraid of losing her.

12:53.058 --> 12:55.415
I can't... lose her. I can't.

12:55.450 --> 12:57.772
Maybe a bottle of aspirin.

12:58.199 --> 13:00.491
- How'd you leave it?
- She didn't say anything.

13:00.526 --> 13:01.790
She just walked off.

13:01.825 --> 13:05.764
That's not good. That means she wants
to think about what she says next.

13:05.799 --> 13:07.758
When chicks think...

13:08.300 --> 13:10.372
When chicks think.

13:10.573 --> 13:12.489
What's wrong with you?
Are you as stupid as he is?

13:12.524 --> 13:14.694
I guess.

13:16.141 --> 13:18.131
Chicks.

13:26.001 --> 13:28.681
She is gonna get a
movie deal out of that.

13:28.716 --> 13:32.519
She'll have time to make a movie. She's
probably gonna get kicked off the squad.

13:32.554 --> 13:33.502
Why?

13:33.537 --> 13:36.575
Um, she's a cheerleader
wearing our school uniform,

13:36.610 --> 13:39.934
and she's hugging some guy with
his shirt off on a street corner at,

13:39.935 --> 13:43.258
like, midnight, after
trying to cut a guy.

13:43.293 --> 13:47.038
Come on, that's hardly a positive
representation of our school.

13:47.073 --> 13:50.784
- Excuse me, can I talk to you?
- We were talking about Grace.

13:50.819 --> 13:51.894
Did you see it?

13:51.929 --> 13:56.708
Yeah, I've seen it. I really need
to talk to you, though, alone.

13:57.285 --> 13:59.771
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

13:59.806 --> 14:02.034
Oh, it's just Amy's so shy, you know.

14:02.069 --> 14:04.262
That's w she wants to talk to us alone.

14:04.297 --> 14:06.624
She's really shy.

14:10.478 --> 14:13.606
Shy? I heard she and Ricky, you know...

14:13.641 --> 14:16.734
Yeah, I know. The whole school knows.

14:17.716 --> 14:18.940
Why would you tell them that?

14:18.975 --> 14:23.457
Well, I didn't want her to
think that you were... rude.

14:23.862 --> 14:27.776
And why would your sister say she's
having sex if she's not having sex?

14:29.351 --> 14:31.585
She loves attention?

14:31.620 --> 14:33.412
She knows about the baby.

14:33.447 --> 14:34.976
OK, I thought we weren't
talking about the...

14:35.011 --> 14:37.131
We weren't, but...

14:38.481 --> 14:41.459
I can't let Ashley get in
trouble because she's trying

14:41.460 --> 14:44.437
to distract my parents from
what's going on with me.

14:44.941 --> 14:47.240
I just can't.

14:48.462 --> 14:50.322
Now I'm gonna have to talk about it.

14:50.357 --> 14:53.750
You do have to, Amy. You do.

14:55.010 --> 14:57.780
And you have to tell your parents.

14:57.815 --> 15:01.281
That is not what you say to
someone in this situation.

15:01.316 --> 15:04.713
Yes, it is, and it's what
I've been saying all along.

15:04.748 --> 15:07.045
You agree with me in private,
but you don't have the nerve

15:07.046 --> 15:09.342
to tell her what you
really think to her face?

15:09.377 --> 15:13.697
What kind of friend are you,
Madison? Tell her the truth.

15:17.925 --> 15:23.545
What? You know I'm right, so...
grow up, Madison, and you, too, Amy.

15:23.580 --> 15:28.252
Be responsible. Talk to
your parents. Get some help.

15:42.172 --> 15:47.284
It's OK. You're doin'
good. You're doin' so good.

15:55.188 --> 15:56.934
Take that off.

15:56.969 --> 16:00.427
I can't. I'd get kicked out of school.

16:01.178 --> 16:02.660
I love this shirt.

16:02.695 --> 16:04.584
No one's gonna know it's mine.

16:04.619 --> 16:06.306
- She will.
- She?

16:06.341 --> 16:07.266
Grace.

16:07.301 --> 16:09.838
Grace Bowman and I are
friends, and she would never

16:09.839 --> 16:12.376
be interested in me as
anything other than a friend.

16:14.333 --> 16:16.452
Don't bet on that.

16:24.535 --> 16:27.515
- Way to go.
- That was some testimony, Grace.

16:27.550 --> 16:29.072
Way to kick butt, Gracie.

16:30.205 --> 16:32.149
Grace the angel.

16:32.596 --> 16:33.830
- Do they know?
- Know?

16:33.865 --> 16:35.805
- That we've been seeing each other.
- They know.

16:35.840 --> 16:37.227
And they know I've been lying.

16:37.262 --> 16:39.815
So they know I've been
lying, too? I should've never

16:39.816 --> 16:42.368
let you talk me into this arrangement.

16:42.897 --> 16:45.347
Maybe they'll realize
I'm not so bad after all.

16:45.382 --> 16:48.653
Are you kidding me? They're
furious with you and Ricky and me.

16:48.688 --> 16:50.702
I'm kinda furious with
you and Ricky, too.

16:50.737 --> 16:52.229
Where was his shirt, by the way?

16:52.264 --> 16:55.378
I don't know. You dumped me on
a street corner and took off.

16:55.413 --> 16:57.141
That was the plan.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.335
Why aren't you in your uniform?

16:59.683 --> 17:00.814
I'm giving up cheerleading.

17:00.849 --> 17:02.255
Your parents are making you do that?

17:02.290 --> 17:04.614
- I'm volunteering to do it.
- Why?

17:04.648 --> 17:07.599
That's what my punishment should
be for lying to my parents.

17:07.635 --> 17:10.430
I offered up every other punishment I
could think of, and they stared at me.

17:10.464 --> 17:12.429
They're the ones that
put you in this position.

17:12.464 --> 17:15.279
They're not stupid. They probably
knew we were sneaking around.

17:15.314 --> 17:17.733
They definitely didn't believe
you were friends with that idiot

17:17.734 --> 17:20.155
drummer or dating him or whatever
the heck you were telling 'em.

17:20.190 --> 17:22.202
What makes you think you're
any better than Ricky?

17:22.237 --> 17:24.180
I am better than Ricky.
Don't get angry at me.

17:24.214 --> 17:26.461
If he hadn't been late, none
of this would've happened.

17:26.496 --> 17:30.249
No, none of this would've happened
if you hadn't kissed Adrian.

17:34.872 --> 17:36.784
Grace, are you OK?

17:36.819 --> 17:39.229
I wanted to call you this morning,
but I didn't know if I should.

17:39.658 --> 17:42.368
I'm so sorry I wasn't
there sooner last night.

17:42.403 --> 17:44.320
This is all my fault.

17:44.355 --> 17:46.386
Hope this doesn't mean you
and Jack are breaking up.

17:46.421 --> 17:49.608
Of course it means we're breaking
up. He never should've left me alone.

17:49.643 --> 17:51.858
Don't blame him. I
should've been there on time.

17:51.893 --> 17:55.173
He didn't apologize. All
he's concerned about is you.

17:55.373 --> 17:59.044
- He's so jealous.
- Of me? What?

17:59.536 --> 18:02.996
He thinks you wanna go out with me
or something. He always thought that.

18:03.031 --> 18:06.280
Who doesn't, especially
after seeing you on the news.

18:06.636 --> 18:09.988
- That was so embarrassing.
- Come on, it's over. It was funny.

18:10.424 --> 18:13.920
Although, I admit, last night...
it was pretty scary, wasn't it?

18:14.167 --> 18:17.268
Yes, it was, and nobody seems
at all concerned about that.

18:17.303 --> 18:20.034
I could've been hurt or... violated.

18:20.069 --> 18:23.960
Yeah... but you weren't.
Could've been, but you weren't.

18:23.995 --> 18:27.063
I think that's what everyone's feelin',

18:27.064 --> 18:30.132
relief that you weren't
hurt or... violated.

18:30.167 --> 18:31.590
You making fun of me?

18:31.625 --> 18:33.496
Would I ever make fun of you?

18:33.531 --> 18:34.684
I don't know. Would you?

18:34.719 --> 18:39.150
Probably, but I know I'd never leave you
alone, drop you off on a street corner.

18:39.185 --> 18:43.125
Who does that? I'm just glad you're OK.

18:43.688 --> 18:45.177
Me too.

18:45.212 --> 18:49.582
And I'm sorry you were scared
and had to defend yourself.

18:49.617 --> 18:51.129
I'm really proud of you.

18:51.164 --> 18:54.818
Thank you. I'm not very proud of myself.

18:55.438 --> 18:57.303
I never should've been
sneaking around with Jack.

18:57.338 --> 19:00.625
You're right. If it had been me,

19:00.626 --> 19:03.912
I'd keep going back to your
dad until he could trust me.

19:06.084 --> 19:10.664
This is his shirt.
Thisis where he left it.

19:19.426 --> 19:22.355
Wow, is everyone goin' crazy?

19:22.390 --> 19:24.402
Is everyone walking
around with their shirts off?

19:24.403 --> 19:26.415
I could walk around
with my shirt off, too.

19:26.450 --> 19:28.642
I'd probably look a lot
better than he did. Huh?

19:30.064 --> 19:33.090
See this? This is what
a real man looks like.

19:33.114 --> 19:37.679
Ach! That's it. OK, it's over.
You're not a man, you're a child.

19:39.316 --> 19:42.043
Dude, have some dignity.

19:58.714 --> 20:00.611
Hey, there you are.

20:00.646 --> 20:03.037
Ben, Amy. Aw, what a cute couple.

20:03.072 --> 20:05.393
Dad, can you please wait in the car?

20:05.428 --> 20:07.129
Been waiting in the
car for a half an hour.

20:07.558 --> 20:10.343
Hi, sir. It's good to
see you. How are you?

20:10.378 --> 20:12.342
Fine. Saw your dad in the parking lot.

20:12.377 --> 20:16.697
He's awaiting for me to ask Amy if
she'd like to get something to eat.

20:16.732 --> 20:18.393
I don't think there's
anything wrong with that.

20:18.428 --> 20:21.305
Dad, it's totally fine. You've
been waiting for a while,

20:21.340 --> 20:23.882
and Ben and I can go some other time.

20:23.917 --> 20:26.944
I already told the Sausage King
it was OK. That's a nice car.

20:26.979 --> 20:29.233
Had to sell a lot of
sausage for that puppy, huh?

20:29.550 --> 20:31.723
Oh, can we send some
sausage over your way?

20:31.758 --> 20:34.134
Or a nice imported salami, perhaps.

20:34.169 --> 20:36.253
It's a little pricey for this
phase of the relationship.

20:36.254 --> 20:38.338
I know what the mark-up
is on meat, but...

20:38.373 --> 20:40.418
- Dad, please stop.
- No, no. It's fine.

20:40.453 --> 20:42.429
Maybe I'll bring
something over tomorrow.

20:42.464 --> 20:46.308
Maybe you will. All right,
you two behave yourselves.

20:47.707 --> 20:51.303
Oh, hold on. Sir, if you don't mind.

20:51.980 --> 20:55.298
Ah. OK. I will make sure that
this horn gets home in good

20:55.299 --> 20:58.616
condition and you do the same
with that precious cargo there.

21:05.562 --> 21:07.035
Well?

21:07.070 --> 21:10.023
Well, you could've asked me if
I wanted to get something to eat.

21:10.058 --> 21:12.873
You always want something
to eat. You're always hungry.

21:12.908 --> 21:14.817
You don't wanna eat?

21:15.765 --> 21:17.741
- I tried to ask you.
- When?

21:17.776 --> 21:20.467
I called your cell, I called
your house phone, I left a note

21:20.468 --> 21:23.158
in your locker, I e-mailed
you, I sent you a text.

21:23.193 --> 21:26.647
OK, Ben, nobody e-mails anymore,
and I didn't get your text.

21:26.682 --> 21:28.286
Yeah, you did.

21:28.321 --> 21:29.855
I didn't read it.

21:29.890 --> 21:32.206
Said the same thing
as the other messages.

21:32.207 --> 21:34.523
"I'm sorry. I'm an idiot, as usual.

21:34.558 --> 21:38.342
"Let's get something to eat
after the game, and I love you. "

21:38.377 --> 21:42.127
Sometimes I just need to talk
to my friends, my girlfriends.

21:42.437 --> 21:44.086
I know that.

21:44.121 --> 21:45.901
I said I was sorry.

21:55.917 --> 21:58.669
Oh, just between you and I,
I think that Henry and Alice

21:58.670 --> 22:01.421
are gonna take that next
step in their relationship.

22:01.456 --> 22:04.407
Yeah, first base, maybe even second.

22:04.442 --> 22:06.410
They had a big fight,
and they're gonna make

22:06.411 --> 22:08.379
up tonight, so that's
what he was planning.

22:08.414 --> 22:09.714
- So?
- So nothing.

22:09.749 --> 22:12.466
I hope you don't think
that we're ready to take

22:12.467 --> 22:15.184
that next step just because
you and I got in a fight.

22:15.219 --> 22:16.303
No.

22:16.338 --> 22:18.599
OK, well, why would you tell me that?

22:18.634 --> 22:21.963
Because you're the person I tell all
my secrets to. You're the woman I love.

22:21.998 --> 22:24.953
- OK, you do not.
- Oh, I do too.

22:25.590 --> 22:27.679
Come on, let's go.

22:31.350 --> 22:33.294
Please?

22:40.701 --> 22:43.298
Uh, the reporters are still
camped out across the street.

22:43.333 --> 22:44.451
What do they want?

22:44.486 --> 22:46.521
They wanna talk to
Gracie. They went to the

22:46.522 --> 22:48.556
game. She wasn't there.
They wanna interview her.

22:48.591 --> 22:50.435
I think she's being too hard on herself.

22:50.470 --> 22:52.399
I don't think she should
have quit cheerleading.

22:52.434 --> 22:53.986
I think she should have.

22:55.080 --> 22:59.130
Maybe you don't realize how big of a deal
it is to be a cheerleader in high school.

22:59.165 --> 23:01.329
I do not want my
daughter attaching all of her

23:01.330 --> 23:03.493
self-worth to the fact
she's a cheerleader.

23:03.528 --> 23:04.764
She's not.

23:04.799 --> 23:07.110
Honey, she loves it, and
it is so good for her.

23:07.428 --> 23:09.277
Telling the truth is also good for her.

23:09.312 --> 23:11.492
Taking responsibility
for having once not

23:11.493 --> 23:13.672
told the truth... that's
even better for her.

23:14.662 --> 23:17.812
Ah, don't worry. She'll figure
out something to do with her time.

23:18.644 --> 23:20.306
Hey. Maybe she can be
the night rent-a-cop

23:20.307 --> 23:21.969
at the drive-in deli
on Frontage Road, hmm?

23:22.004 --> 23:25.190
It's not funny.
OK, honey, she's 15.

23:25.225 --> 23:26.499
She-She made a mistake.

23:26.534 --> 23:31.057
Yeah, she made a mistake, a big mistake.
She made a surprisingly big mistake.

23:33.785 --> 23:35.633
Well... at least she
didn't make the same mistake

23:35.634 --> 23:37.481
Amy Juergens made.
She still in the band?

23:37.516 --> 23:41.218
Sweetheart, I told you that
in confidence, all right?

23:41.253 --> 23:44.340
This is a doctor-patient
confidentiality thing.

23:44.746 --> 23:48.054
I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't say
it again, not to me, not to anybody else.

23:56.611 --> 23:59.480
Hey, I thought you were
going out after the game.

23:59.515 --> 24:00.818
No.

24:01.654 --> 24:03.545
- Oh. So, who won?
- We did.

24:03.580 --> 24:05.302
That's good. How did halftime go?

24:05.337 --> 24:06.989
<i>Hey, you got anything to drink?</i>

24:07.024 --> 24:10.185
<i>One of your little liquor bottles
from the airline, shot of scotch?</i>

24:11.069 --> 24:14.027
I'm getting it. Adrian just walked in.

24:16.538 --> 24:19.415
- I saw your boyfriend on the news.
- Oh, are they still running that?

24:19.450 --> 24:21.772
- He's cute.
- He's not my boyfriend.

24:21.807 --> 24:24.060
- Then what is he?
- I don't know.

24:24.095 --> 24:26.791
What's the guy in your
room? What do you call him?

24:26.826 --> 24:30.612
A friend, an old friend. It's not what
you're thinking. He just dropped by.

24:30.647 --> 24:34.053
Yeah, whatever. As long as I
don't have to call him uncle.

24:40.347 --> 24:43.451
- What?
- So how have you been?

24:43.486 --> 24:46.556
Oh, hi, Jack. I knew you'd call.

24:56.361 --> 24:58.399
Hey. I thought you were
coming home with your father.

24:58.434 --> 25:00.402
Yeah, I thought so, too,
but Ben invited me to...

25:00.437 --> 25:04.715
Do you have any idea where he is?
He said he was gonna go shoot some pool.

25:06.040 --> 25:08.588
Did that a lot when
we first got married.

25:08.623 --> 25:11.676
- Played a lot of pool.
- Mom.

25:11.711 --> 25:15.030
- Is everything OK?
- I don't know.

25:15.514 --> 25:17.599
I really don't know.

25:18.302 --> 25:20.074
Amy, I have to ask you something.

25:20.313 --> 25:23.538
- I- I didn't do anything.
- Oh, God, I'm not accusing you.

25:23.573 --> 25:26.870
You're perfect. Close to perfect.

25:27.371 --> 25:29.333
Both my girls are.

25:29.368 --> 25:33.497
Although I really don't know why Ashley
wants me to think she's having sex.

25:33.532 --> 25:35.947
I don't think she's having sex.

25:36.233 --> 25:40.274
What I think she's doing is she's trying
to stir something up to distract me.

25:40.309 --> 25:41.818
She does that, you know.

25:41.819 --> 25:44.775
She senses that there's a problem,
so she creates another one.

25:45.828 --> 25:48.357
I think she's trying to protect someone.

25:50.589 --> 25:53.481
Amy, I think that your father...

25:54.303 --> 25:56.373
Oh, I shouldn't be
talking to you about this.

25:56.408 --> 25:58.327
You're way too young for this.

25:58.362 --> 26:00.459
Yeah, probably.

26:01.535 --> 26:03.159
Good night, Mom.

26:03.194 --> 26:06.924
Oh, honey, I didn't mean
to upset you. No, I'm sorry.

26:06.959 --> 26:09.448
I love you. You know that.

26:09.483 --> 26:13.576
Thank you for being such a
wonderful daughter. Thank you.

26:16.574 --> 26:20.041
I heard Grace's parents are making
her quit the cheerleading squad.

26:21.696 --> 26:23.563
What?

26:32.566 --> 26:34.806
So... what's the big emergency?

26:34.841 --> 26:37.046
No emergency. Just wanted to talk.

26:37.965 --> 26:40.077
But not on the phone.

26:40.676 --> 26:43.014
So what's up? Besides you.

26:43.049 --> 26:46.588
- Can I come in?
- I guess. My mom just left.

26:55.340 --> 26:58.391
What do you want? Like
I don't know already.

26:58.426 --> 27:02.660
You know, maybe, Adrian, maybe
I don't just want sex from you.

27:02.867 --> 27:06.121
You ever thought about that?
Maybe I want a relationship.

27:06.156 --> 27:10.038
Maybe, if you can believe it,
maybe I care about you as a person.

27:10.073 --> 27:11.509
Maybe.

27:11.948 --> 27:14.738
Or maybe this isn't about sex,
maybe you just need someone

27:14.739 --> 27:17.528
to write your English Lit
paper for you before Monday.

27:17.563 --> 27:18.958
Are you volunteering to write my paper?

27:18.993 --> 27:22.576
- No, I'm not.
- I don't care. That's not what I want.

27:24.045 --> 27:25.778
I want you to come to
church with me tomorrow.

27:26.287 --> 27:27.207
Ew. Church?

27:27.242 --> 27:30.211
Every relationship needs a
good foundation, and if our

27:30.212 --> 27:33.181
foundation was Christ, I think
even you and I could make it.

27:33.216 --> 27:34.316
Make it?

27:34.351 --> 27:38.457
I want a girlfriend, a real girlfriend,
and in order for you to be my

27:38.458 --> 27:42.563
girlfriend, we need more than just
being physically attracted to each other.

27:45.041 --> 27:49.325
Oh, you are so full of it, Jack,
OK? Come on, what do you really want?

27:49.360 --> 27:52.632
I mean, why would you want
me to go to church with you?

27:56.430 --> 27:59.538
Oh. Grace? You wanna make Grace jealous?

27:59.573 --> 28:03.686
Well, that would be a bonus, of course,
in addition to introducing you to Christ.

28:03.721 --> 28:05.316
Of course.

28:05.351 --> 28:08.096
She's not interested
in you right now, huh?

28:08.490 --> 28:10.393
She's interested in Ricky?

28:12.017 --> 28:13.665
All right.

28:17.321 --> 28:20.619
My mom has a new boyfriend, and I
wanna get out of the house anyway.

28:20.654 --> 28:24.267
How is our crime-fighting, cheerleading
little witch doing this morning, anyway?

28:24.302 --> 28:25.529
Didn't you see the news?

28:25.564 --> 28:28.294
Oh, please, how many times can
people really watch that tape?

28:28.329 --> 28:30.322
There's a new one.

28:32.075 --> 28:35.828
Over and over. It gets
better and better every time.

28:36.483 --> 28:41.016
<i>They told me this guy is Ricky.
He is a drummer. He's in the band.</i>

28:41.051 --> 28:43.312
<i>And what's your sister's
relationship with him?</i>

28:43.347 --> 28:45.488
<i>He's her friend.</i>

28:45.523 --> 28:47.463
<i>Oh, he looks like a pretty good friend.</i>

28:48.291 --> 28:51.578
<i>- Hey, Mother, you're on TV.
- Turn off the camera.</i>

28:51.613 --> 28:54.623
<i>How dare you, you lowlife?</i>

28:55.742 --> 28:59.333
Can you believe that? They
took advantage of the kid.

29:00.010 --> 29:03.778
Can I believe it? Sure I could believe
it. It's a big cruel world out there.

29:03.813 --> 29:05.869
People will do anything.

29:09.515 --> 29:12.728
What do you think, uh, happened to
the two guys that attacked Grace?

29:12.763 --> 29:14.857
Wouldn't they get arrested or something?

29:14.892 --> 29:15.956
For what?

29:16.429 --> 29:18.294
I don't know. Sexual harassment?

29:18.329 --> 29:21.339
Are you kidding? They'd probably come
back and sue her for threatening them.

29:21.374 --> 29:24.973
This is how the world
works. It's unfair.

29:26.571 --> 29:27.980
Not everybody's nice.

29:28.015 --> 29:31.606
Sometimes people take advantage
of other people... nice people.

29:32.406 --> 29:34.511
What's with all the
negativity, Sausage King?

29:34.546 --> 29:38.100
I don't know. I'm not just a
sausage king. I'm a realist.

29:38.135 --> 29:40.190
Wha...? Since when?

29:40.225 --> 29:42.143
Always.

29:43.303 --> 29:46.510
- Is there something wrong?
- Not that I know of.

29:46.643 --> 29:50.420
So, uh, is it OK with you if I take
the Juergenses a little gift basket?

29:50.455 --> 29:53.566
Couple of salamis, a few
kielbasas, package of franks.

29:53.601 --> 29:56.853
Little deli mustard. Ooh,
maybe a pickle or two?

29:56.888 --> 30:00.106
You take her anything you
want. She's a nice girl.

30:00.504 --> 30:02.065
She is.

30:02.100 --> 30:04.071
Got a good appetite, too, that girl.

30:04.106 --> 30:05.221
Yeah, she does.

30:05.256 --> 30:07.386
You're not fooling
around with her, are you?

30:08.135 --> 30:09.787
What?

30:11.361 --> 30:13.476
- You serious?
- I'm trying to be serious.

30:13.511 --> 30:16.071
What would make you ask
me something like that?

30:16.106 --> 30:18.454
I don't know. I... I see things.

30:18.489 --> 30:21.116
Do you see things or do you hear things?

30:21.151 --> 30:23.743
Because don't always
believe what you hear.

30:23.778 --> 30:25.674
- Have I ever?
- No.

30:25.709 --> 30:27.536
So why would I now?

30:27.571 --> 30:30.581
I mean, besides, I
haven't heard anything.

30:30.616 --> 30:34.477
- What's to hear?
- Nothing.

30:34.970 --> 30:38.286
She's a nice girl, Ben, but
things don't always work out

30:38.287 --> 30:41.602
the way we plan,
especially if we don't plan.

30:41.937 --> 30:44.818
OK, you've completely lost me here.

30:45.282 --> 30:47.181
Is she pregnant?

30:47.940 --> 30:49.798
- Pregnant?
- Yeah, you know...

30:49.833 --> 30:52.285
- is she gonna have a baby?
- Wha...?

30:53.324 --> 30:57.042
Amy? Are we still
talking about Amy, or...?

30:59.168 --> 31:00.167
No.

31:00.375 --> 31:03.540
W... I... She can't be
pregnant. I just kissed her.

31:04.466 --> 31:09.443
Just that one kiss. It was
just a kiss. What... No.

31:21.036 --> 31:22.484
Where's Mom?

31:22.519 --> 31:25.448
She's cleaning out her
closet or something.

31:27.117 --> 31:28.279
Why?

31:28.314 --> 31:30.842
Oh, I-I was j-just...
just wondering.

31:30.877 --> 31:33.321
Did you want something?

31:36.775 --> 31:38.418
- Th-The thing is that...
- What's with the stuttering?

31:38.453 --> 31:41.311
- I thought you were over that.
- I am.

31:43.471 --> 31:45.086
Looks like my competition's
running a sale.

31:45.121 --> 31:46.701
I gotta go down to the
store and lower prices.

31:46.736 --> 31:49.105
Not one of my favorite things.

31:49.140 --> 31:51.475
Dad, Ashley's not having sex.

31:51.510 --> 31:52.986
Yeah, I didn't think so.

31:53.021 --> 31:56.108
But she really wants people to
think that, even her parents.

31:56.143 --> 31:59.206
She pulls these stunts when she's
trying to distract us from something.

31:59.241 --> 32:02.003
It's the old "watch the right hand while
the left hand's doin' something else. "

32:02.038 --> 32:04.260
She's quite a magician, that one.

32:04.917 --> 32:08.157
Maybe she's just, you know,
saying that she's having

32:08.158 --> 32:11.397
sex because she's trying
to cover for someone who is?

32:13.986 --> 32:16.146
And who would that be?

32:19.106 --> 32:23.742
Me. I did it. Dad, everybody's talking
about it. She was just covering for me.

32:23.777 --> 32:27.290
- You did not have sex. I know you!
- Dad, you don't know me.

32:27.325 --> 32:29.792
I did have sex.

32:31.824 --> 32:34.716
- Yeah, right.
- OK, you two, what is goin' on?

32:34.751 --> 32:37.026
I think we need to talk.

32:37.641 --> 32:41.039
- What do you mean, the four of us?
- The two of us.

32:43.862 --> 32:46.625
Why do these young girls want everyone to
think they're having sex? I don't get it.

32:46.660 --> 32:48.562
I don't either, unless...

32:48.937 --> 32:51.301
Are you having sex?

32:51.974 --> 32:54.932
I think you know the answer
to that. You're my wife.

32:57.161 --> 32:59.733
What, do you mean with
someone other than you?

33:02.435 --> 33:05.044
Don't be ridiculous.

33:08.812 --> 33:12.317
- You idiot. You can't tell them.
- Ashley, I have to.

33:12.352 --> 33:15.823
No, you don't. I think
they're having a big fight.

33:16.520 --> 33:19.160
- With each other?
- Yeah.

33:23.641 --> 33:24.439
Hi, Ben.

33:24.474 --> 33:27.883
Hey, Amy, I was thinkin',
let's go out tonight.

33:28.225 --> 33:31.461
Um, I don't think I can. I have
to do something with my family.

33:32.448 --> 33:35.859
Yeah, I'm sorry. It's
not a good day here.

33:35.894 --> 33:39.763
All right. Well, uh... you wanna talk?

33:39.798 --> 33:42.318
I don't think so. Maybe tomorrow.

33:42.353 --> 33:45.224
Tomorrow seems like
a long time from now.

33:45.518 --> 33:48.266
But it's a Sunday. I like Sundays.

33:48.301 --> 33:50.179
Especially in the afternoon.

33:50.650 --> 33:54.064
Uh, you wanna study?
I'll make you some wings.

33:55.293 --> 33:59.370
Come on. You love wings.
With a little ranch on the side.

34:00.919 --> 34:04.562
Well, maybe I could. OK.

34:04.597 --> 34:08.205
So... what time? Noon?

34:14.922 --> 34:17.056
Did you tell him yet?

34:17.398 --> 34:19.406
- Should I?
- I don't know. I'm 12.

34:19.440 --> 34:20.973
13.

34:37.750 --> 34:40.661
Wow. That's a nice dress you have there.

34:40.697 --> 34:43.047
Mm. No, just a skirt and
a blouse, but thank you.

34:43.083 --> 34:45.145
You're welcome. Thank
you for wearing it.

34:45.179 --> 34:47.681
Well, you don't look so bad yourself.

34:47.717 --> 34:49.248
Thank you.

34:51.641 --> 34:54.259
I don't think I've ever
been to a Protestant

34:54.260 --> 34:56.877
church before. Are you sure this is OK?

34:56.911 --> 35:00.121
It's the only conservative out fit I own.

35:01.678 --> 35:04.431
Yeah, I think
that's-that's definitely OK.

35:04.466 --> 35:06.400
- So how much time do we have?
- We have a few minutes.

35:06.435 --> 35:12.387
Good. If my mind serves me correctly,
a few minutes is all the time we need.

35:13.098 --> 35:15.542
Oh, no-no. I can't do that again.

35:15.577 --> 35:17.952
- Are you sure?
- Before church?

35:17.987 --> 35:21.218
- Yeah. Why not?
- Why not? Are you kidding?

35:21.919 --> 35:25.416
I think God would understand
if two people wanted to...

35:25.417 --> 35:28.914
be together in a Biblical
sense before going to church.

35:28.949 --> 35:32.955
No. I don't think he would
understand at all, actually.

35:32.990 --> 35:36.340
Why not? God made me, God
made you. God made me and you.

35:36.375 --> 35:39.691
I think the Devil may have
more to do with me and you.

35:39.726 --> 35:41.416
Oh, what's the matter?

35:41.451 --> 35:43.185
Didn't you have a good time last time?

35:43.220 --> 35:47.344
I had a great time, but it wasn't worth
all the guilt and trouble it caused.

35:47.379 --> 35:50.102
I think you like trouble, and so do I.

35:50.137 --> 35:52.457
That's why we're going to
church together, isn't it?

35:52.492 --> 35:55.269
Look, everyone's gonna think
we're doing something anyway,

35:55.304 --> 35:58.069
so we might as well be
doing something, right?

35:58.104 --> 36:00.799
Wrong. I don't care what
everyone else thinks.

36:00.834 --> 36:06.030
It's what I think. I think
sex before marriage is a sin.

36:06.065 --> 36:07.394
Well, aren't we all sinners?

36:07.429 --> 36:09.058
Yeah, but...

36:09.093 --> 36:11.550
OK, look, we'll go to
confession afterwards.

36:11.585 --> 36:12.865
We don't have confession.

36:12.900 --> 36:14.850
- No?
- No.

36:14.885 --> 36:16.122
Well, what do you have?

36:16.157 --> 36:20.680
We have guilt, shame, regret.

36:21.551 --> 36:22.672
Yeah, we got those.

36:22.707 --> 36:25.572
I don't think I want
to be a part of that.

36:26.113 --> 36:30.022
But besides, I don't think that you'll
regret just one more time, would you?

36:30.057 --> 36:31.132
Yes, I would.

36:31.167 --> 36:36.161
OK, look, I don't think it's gonna make
Ricky jealous if we just go to church.

36:36.196 --> 36:40.377
It might make Grace jealous, but
it's not going to make Ricky jealous.

36:40.412 --> 36:44.558
So I really don't get anything
out of this unless we do something.

36:46.179 --> 36:48.695
We can make out. I think that'd be OK.

36:48.730 --> 36:51.039
- You wanna make out?
- We can start with that.

36:51.074 --> 36:53.348
No, I swear, we can't do
anything more than that.

36:53.520 --> 36:56.173
- More than that would be a sin.
- Oh, what, is it in the Bible?

36:56.208 --> 36:58.110
- Yes, it's in the Bible.
- You're making that up.

36:58.145 --> 36:59.389
No, I'm not.

36:59.424 --> 37:01.341
Where in the Bible does it say that we

37:01.342 --> 37:03.259
can't do more than
make out before church?

37:03.555 --> 37:06.190
I don't know, but I'm sure
it's in there somewhere.

37:06.225 --> 37:08.825
- Deuteronomy, maybe?
- What about after church?

37:09.565 --> 37:12.474
Revelations. I don't know.

37:13.031 --> 37:16.456
- Can we just get outta here? Please?
- Sure.

37:17.671 --> 37:21.935
Are there any rules that say that what
we can or cannot do on the ride over?

37:25.360 --> 37:26.974
Help.

37:34.471 --> 37:37.922
You look as good in a
shirt as without one.

37:37.957 --> 37:41.055
This is a very nice look.

37:41.343 --> 37:42.855
Very nice.

37:44.535 --> 37:46.273
So, wait, you're not...

37:46.308 --> 37:48.883
- Goin' to church.
- Ricky, come on, don't do this.

37:48.918 --> 37:51.441
- Bye.
- Wait, please.

37:51.476 --> 37:53.683
I can't believe you'd try to
keep me from goin' to church.

37:53.718 --> 37:57.372
If you were going for a good
reason, I wouldn't try to stop you.

37:57.407 --> 38:00.616
I would encourage you,
but you are going to church

38:00.617 --> 38:03.825
just so that you can
"get with" Grace Bowman.

38:04.010 --> 38:06.960
- That's pretty scary.
- You wanna hear something scarier?

38:06.995 --> 38:12.973
Once you get with Grace, you're gonna
feel sick for taking advantage of her.

38:13.208 --> 38:16.328
You're gonna withdraw from
her, never call her again.

38:16.363 --> 38:19.131
That's what you do. That's the pattern.

38:19.166 --> 38:23.015
- I don't have a pattern, OK?
- Yes, you do, sweetheart.

38:23.050 --> 38:25.682
And Grace Bowman, who
tries to be perfect,

38:25.683 --> 38:28.314
is gonna be flawed,
at least in her eyes,

38:28.315 --> 38:33.578
and who knows if she can live with that
kind of imperfection? Her or her parents.

38:33.688 --> 38:38.123
It's a bigger deal to this young
woman than I think you can understand.

38:38.158 --> 38:41.308
I'm giving you good advice here.

38:41.642 --> 38:44.035
Don't.

38:46.843 --> 38:48.740
Still too sick to go to church?

38:48.775 --> 38:51.017
Oh, the Lord, he works
in mysterious ways.

38:51.052 --> 38:52.880
Yeah, he does.

38:52.915 --> 38:56.265
Honey, thanks for encouraging Grace
to get back on the cheer squad.

38:56.559 --> 38:58.016
Ah, of course.

38:58.051 --> 39:00.628
I'm surprised that you did
not realize what a big deal

39:00.629 --> 39:03.206
it is for a young girl to be
a cheerleader in high school.

39:03.241 --> 39:05.837
Oh, really? Unbelievable.
You know what, sweetie?

39:05.838 --> 39:08.434
If we get our butts moving,
we can still make the sermon.

39:08.469 --> 39:10.870
Oh, no. Nope, I-I'm far...

39:12.691 --> 39:14.913
- ... too sick for that.
- OK.

39:15.408 --> 39:16.864
You're such a baby.

39:16.899 --> 39:19.212
<i>She's a powerful girl, Grace Bowman.</i>

39:19.247 --> 39:21.935
She's our very own
Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

39:21.970 --> 39:25.861
She's a beautiful example
of faith in the power of God.

39:25.896 --> 39:29.753
- I told you, you're a hero.
- I'll be right back, Tom, OK?

39:30.662 --> 39:33.885
Grace, come over here. This
is the young lady right here.

39:33.920 --> 39:36.356
- Are you Grace Bowman?
- Yeah, I am.

39:36.391 --> 39:40.714
Terrific. I really wasn't expecting
you to show up, but I was hoping.

39:41.030 --> 39:43.332
I just wanna say that
it's very kind of our

39:43.333 --> 39:45.634
minister to speak so highly
of me after what I did.

39:45.669 --> 39:47.909
But that's just how he
is, and that's how our

39:47.910 --> 39:50.149
church members are...
supportive and caring.

39:50.489 --> 39:54.752
- And even though I made a mistake...
- And what was your mistake, exactly?

40:00.197 --> 40:02.827
I was sneaking around trying
to see a guy my parents didn't

40:02.828 --> 40:05.458
want me to see, and it was
wrong to do that, very wrong.

40:05.493 --> 40:08.088
My parents know what's best
for me, and they always have

40:08.089 --> 40:10.684
my best interests at heart,
and I didn't listen to them.

40:10.719 --> 40:14.980
And so I found myself on a street corner
late at night, waiting for a guy to

40:14.981 --> 40:19.241
pick me up to pretend to be my date, and
I got myself in a very scary situation.

40:19.276 --> 40:21.105
Then you got yourself out.

40:21.140 --> 40:24.190
Well, I think I must have had a
guardian angel looking out for me.

40:24.225 --> 40:28.152
I see. Guardian angel.
That's the explanation.

40:28.438 --> 40:31.048
Not everything in this
life can be explained.

40:31.083 --> 40:35.044
And do you have an explanation as
to why your friend was shirtless?

40:35.635 --> 40:37.779
Well, the guy I wasn't
supposed to be seeing

40:37.780 --> 40:39.923
dropped me off, and so
I called my friend and

40:39.924 --> 40:42.068
I woke him up, and so
he jumped out of bed,

40:42.069 --> 40:44.212
got in his car and raced
over to help me out.

40:44.658 --> 40:46.727
We like to think that
when we do the wrong

40:46.728 --> 40:48.796
thing or make a bad
decision it only affects us,

40:48.831 --> 40:52.332
but that obviously isn't
true, and I just wanna say I'm

40:52.333 --> 40:55.833
so sorry for any problems
I might have caused anyone.

40:56.678 --> 40:58.492
Isn't that your friend over there?

40:58.527 --> 40:59.967
Yeah, it is.

41:00.002 --> 41:02.660
Ooh, Ricky Underwood. Jackpot.

41:02.695 --> 41:04.654
Hey. Ricky.

41:06.668 --> 41:08.039
Hey, Ricky.

41:10.909 --> 41:13.361
- Hey, Grace.
- Hey, Adrian.

41:13.396 --> 41:16.264
Welcome... everyone.

41:30.564 --> 41:33.266
- That preacher bugs me.
- Yeah. Me too.

41:33.301 --> 41:35.969
I like that. We don't
like the same people.

41:36.004 --> 41:38.010
You're practically family.

41:39.936 --> 41:41.961
- Vegetarians.
- Hate 'em.

41:41.996 --> 41:44.568
- Earth Day?
- Please. Here's one.

41:44.603 --> 41:48.268
Al Gore. Come to Papa.

41:49.235 --> 41:52.087
It's you two versus the
entire planet on that one.

41:52.122 --> 41:53.575
I love Al Gore.

41:54.397 --> 41:56.687
Hi, Ben. You're-You're early.

41:56.722 --> 41:59.258
Is that any way to talk to the
guy who brought this basket?

41:59.293 --> 42:01.207
There's enough meat in
here to last us the winter.

42:01.242 --> 42:03.886
Jeez, that thing is huge.

42:03.921 --> 42:07.338
Well, my feelings for you are...

42:09.921 --> 42:11.443
Very big.

42:12.819 --> 42:15.527
- You almost ready to go?
- Yeah, anytime. Got your books?

42:15.562 --> 42:16.950
Yeah.

42:20.219 --> 42:21.578
Thanks.

42:22.251 --> 42:23.460
What's that?

42:23.495 --> 42:25.537
Dad, is that your suitcase?

42:26.263 --> 42:28.989
Uh... yeah, furniture
thing. Gotta go to Vegas.

42:29.714 --> 42:30.875
I didn't know.

42:30.910 --> 42:32.376
I'll be back in a couple days.

42:32.628 --> 42:34.158
OK.

42:43.372 --> 42:46.613
OK, you two have fun. Study.

42:46.648 --> 42:48.555
Got it.

42:53.178 --> 42:55.188
Bye.
