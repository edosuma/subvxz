I'm sorry, did
I wake you up?

00:43.396 --> 00:44.812
What are you doing?

00:44.814 --> 00:49.200
I was trying to find
a nice way to wake you up.

Well, kudos, you found one.

Here. Merry day

to exchange presents.

00:56.909 --> 01:00.461

Key to your heart?

01:14.727 --> 01:16.644
Better. It's a key
to my house.

01:16.646 --> 01:20.731
Walden, I can't accept
a key to your house.

01:20.733 --> 01:22.900
It's a bit premature.

01:22.902 --> 01:25.186
Well, if anything in our
relationship's going to be premature,

01:25.188 --> 01:27.071
I prefer it to be
the house key.

01:27.073 --> 01:30.474

09:32.681 --> 09:34.214
as fast as human children, so

You went as a gorilla,

10:25.500 --> 10:26.933
and Magilla went as a ghost.

10:29.954 --> 10:31.921
Whoa, whoa.

10:31.923 --> 10:34.574
Yeah, okay. Yeah, it's
starting to come back to me.

10:34.576 --> 10:35.825
Like, riding
tricycles together,

10:35.827 --> 10:38.060
and running...
running around the house.

10:38.062 --> 10:40.613
Or playing hide in the closet.

10:40.615 --> 10:43.500
Wait. Why were we always
hiding in the closet?

10:43.502 --> 10:46.369
Well, the Homeowners Association
didn't allow cats or dogs.

10:46.371 --> 10:48.621
What would they have said
about a gorilla?

10:48.623 --> 10:50.623
Yeah. I remember.

10:50.625 --> 10:52.542
You told me he was my brother.

10:52.544 --> 10:54.878
Well, in a sense, he was.

10:54.880 --> 10:57.046
And then one day, he was gone.

10:57.048 --> 10:59.081
Yeah.

10:59.083 --> 11:01.184
You said
he got sent back to the jungle.

11:01.186 --> 11:02.919
Well, sweetheart,
we didn't have any choice.

11:02.921 --> 11:04.637
He was getting too big.
He, uh...

11:04.639 --> 11:06.923
He tried
to kill a Jehovah's Witness.

11:08.826 --> 11:11.260
Now, Now, to be fair,
who among us hasn't...

11:11.262 --> 11:12.529
Not now, Alan.

11:14.264 --> 11:16.199
This is really starting
to freak me out.

11:16.201 --> 11:17.367
Well, sweetie,
I-I don't understand

11:17.369 --> 11:19.702
why you're making such
a big deal out of this.

11:19.704 --> 11:21.621
You're kidding, right?

11:21.623 --> 11:24.958
I-I just discovered
that my brother is a gorilla!

11:24.960 --> 11:27.327
That's-That's
kind of a big deal!

11:27.329 --> 11:29.045
Hey, my brother was a pig,
so, I mean...

11:29.047 --> 11:31.280
I said, not now, Alan!

11:32.333 --> 11:34.250
Walden, calm down.

11:34.252 --> 11:37.453
You do realize
that I spent my entire childhood

11:37.455 --> 11:38.805
worrying that if I misbehaved,

11:38.807 --> 11:41.508
I would get sent away
to the jungle like Magilla!

11:41.510 --> 11:44.110
One false move, Zimbabwe!

11:44.112 --> 11:46.128
Well, sweetheart, I...

11:46.130 --> 11:48.314
I never knew
that you felt like that.

11:48.316 --> 11:49.632
Of course you didn't.

11:49.634 --> 11:52.018
You were so busy
doing your experiment!

12:11.374 --> 12:15.743
I had no idea he'd repressed
all those childhood memories.

12:15.745 --> 12:17.128
Well, apparently,

12:17.130 --> 12:19.530
losing what he thought was
his sibling was very traumatic.

12:19.532 --> 12:22.967
I'm wondering if maybe I have
to rethink his Christmas gift.

12:22.969 --> 12:24.702
Why? What did you get him?

12:24.704 --> 12:27.204
A bathrobe.

12:27.206 --> 12:28.973
Yeah, not a good idea.

12:39.552 --> 12:41.602
Um, did you tell him
that Disneyland burned down

12:41.604 --> 12:43.187
to avoid having
to take him there

12:43.189 --> 12:44.822
for his sixth, seventh
and eighth birthdays?

12:44.824 --> 12:46.023
No.

12:46.025 --> 12:47.725
Did you tell him
to walk it off

12:47.727 --> 12:48.893
after his appendix burst?

12:48.895 --> 12:50.561
No.

12:50.563 --> 12:52.580
Did you tell me
the only reason you got pregnant

12:52.582 --> 12:54.448
was because you didn't want
to smear your lipstick?

12:54.450 --> 12:57.752
Of course not!

12:57.754 --> 12:59.337
Then, far as I'm concerned,

12:59.339 --> 13:01.906
you're Mother

13:01.908 --> 13:03.875
Mm. Although I did store
Walden's embryo

13:03.877 --> 13:06.294
in a cryogenic chamber until
Magilla's mother got pregnant

13:06.296 --> 13:08.746

Okay, flag on the play.

13:11.518 --> 13:13.050

13:13.052 --> 13:15.102
I needed my child
and the gorilla

13:15.104 --> 13:17.805
to be born at the same time
for the experiment to be valid.

13:17.807 --> 13:19.607

was okay with this?

13:19.609 --> 13:21.726
It was for science.

13:21.728 --> 13:23.928
And I may not have told him.

Okay, well, well, after all
