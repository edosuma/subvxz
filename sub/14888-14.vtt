Cousin, I'm so excited,

01:25.233 --> 01:27.466
and I just can't hide it.

01:27.500 --> 01:29.633
I'm about to lose control..

01:31.533 --> 01:33.433
...and I think I like it.

01:35.233 --> 01:38.433
I can't believe I am finally
going to fly on an aero plane

01:38.466 --> 01:41.066
and spend a whole week
in The Great Pumpkin.

01:44.400 --> 01:45.700
No, Balki,
not "The Great Pumpkin."

01:45.733 --> 01:47.600
New York City
is the "Big Apple."

01:49.466 --> 01:50.766
I‐is that all you're taking?

01:50.800 --> 01:54.600
Well, of course not.
Don't be ridiculous.

Are you two ready
for New York City?

02:09.300 --> 02:11.032
Larry, a‐about that

02:11.066 --> 02:13.066
I'm afraid
we have some bad news.

02:13.100 --> 02:15.066
We've finally been assigned
to work the Hawaii flight

02:15.100 --> 02:16.533
the one we've been
bidding on for so long.

02:16.566 --> 02:19.066
It's the best route
on the schedule more money

02:19.100 --> 02:22.133
and something most flight
attendants only dream about.

02:22.166 --> 02:23.400
Well, that doesn't
sound like bad news to me.

02:24.366 --> 02:25.666
It doesn't, does it?

02:28.166 --> 02:29.566
What was the bad news, Jennifer?

02:33.066 --> 02:34.433
The bad news is that

02:34.466 --> 02:36.133
we have to start
our new flight tomorrow

02:36.166 --> 02:38.666
so we can't go
to New York with you guys.

02:38.700 --> 02:40.333
I‐I'm really sorry, Larry.

02:40.366 --> 02:45.200

the...the Big Apple will be
rotten to the core.

02:56.400 --> 02:59.500
Gee, too bad you guys
are so set on New York.

02:59.533 --> 03:01.600
If you weren't,
you could go to Hawaii with us.

03:03.100 --> 03:05.266
Hawaii?
Well, that sounds great!

03:05.300 --> 03:07.100
But‐but I don't know
if we can afford it

03:07.133 --> 03:09.433
No, sure you can. If you fly
stand by it'll be just

03:09.466 --> 03:11.333
a little bit more than you
spend on your trip to New York.

03:11.366 --> 03:13.600

bombed Pearl Bailey?

12:14.800 --> 12:16.333
and they never made me sick..

12:16.366 --> 12:17.633
...un‐unless I have them
with milk.

12:19.466 --> 12:22.033
But‐but you don't combine
spleen with dairy products.

12:22.066 --> 12:23.533
It's, uh, common knowledge.

12:26.133 --> 12:27.233
What happens if you do?

12:27.266 --> 12:28.066
You wish you were dead.

12:36.400 --> 12:37.366
Ah.

12:40.233 --> 12:41.500
‐ Mary Anne?
‐ Hm?

12:41.533 --> 12:42.600
H‐how do you feel?

12:42.633 --> 12:44.066
I wish I were dead.

12:46.133 --> 12:48.133
Not a good sign, cousin.

12:48.166 --> 12:50.200
Did you have any dairy
products this morning?

12:50.233 --> 12:52.700
Just the cream in my coffee.

12:52.733 --> 12:53.766
That would do it.

12:59.766 --> 13:02.633
Jennifer, maybe
you should get help

13:02.666 --> 13:04.333
from the flight attendants
in first class.

13:04.366 --> 13:06.200
No, Larry, they'll think
we can't handle the job

13:06.233 --> 13:07.700
and we'll lose the route.

13:07.733 --> 13:08.733
Hey, don't worry.

13:08.766 --> 13:11.133
I‐I had a glass of milk, and..

13:11.166 --> 13:12.566
...I think that will make
me feel better.

13:13.566 --> 13:14.700
Think again.

13:16.100 --> 13:17.066
Ohh!

13:19.733 --> 13:21.400
Cousin, uh, remind me

13:21.433 --> 13:24.333
to put a warning label
on any future chalkidikis.

13:26.233 --> 13:27.666
Balki, are they
gonna be alright?

13:27.700 --> 13:30.200
Yeah, of course, they're gonna
be fine in just a few hours.

13:30.233 --> 13:33.633
But until then,
it won't be pretty.

13:33.666 --> 13:36.366
(male #1)
'Hey, what do you have to do
to get a drink on this flight?'

13:36.400 --> 13:38.533
Oh, I‐I guess, I better explain
to the other passengers.

13:38.566 --> 13:40.100
I'm sure they'll understand.

13:40.133 --> 13:42.600
No, no, no.
You can't do that.

13:42.633 --> 13:44.333
Those people
don't wanna understand.

13:44.366 --> 13:46.300
All they want is service.

13:46.333 --> 13:48.100
Well, of course, how are
they going to get service

13:48.133 --> 13:49.600
with, uh, Jennifer
and Marry Anne so sick?

13:52.433 --> 13:53.600
We'll do it ourselves.

13:53.633 --> 13:55.133
‐ What?
‐ Come on.

13:55.166 --> 13:57.333
All we have to do
is pass out a few magazines

13:57.366 --> 13:59.200
pour some coffee,
heat up a few TV dinners.

13:59.233 --> 14:01.133
‐ Let's go.
‐ Cousin, I‐I want the blue one.

14:01.166 --> 14:01.800
No, it doesn't make
any difference.

14:01.833 --> 14:03.200
No, I really want it.

14:03.233 --> 14:04.700
‐ I need the blue‐‐
‐ Alright. Alright.

14:04.733 --> 14:06.166
Alright. Alright. Here.

14:11.833 --> 14:14.033
'Okay.'

14:14.066 --> 14:15.700
Let's head 'em up..

14:15.733 --> 14:16.700
...and move 'em out.

14:27.266 --> 14:29.066
Maybe this little thing
down here is the brake.

14:34.333 --> 14:35.600
[crash]

14:38.433 --> 14:40.300
Yep.

14:40.333 --> 14:41.333
That was it.

14:59.508 --> 15:01.845
Sir, may I interest you
in a refreshing beverage?

15:01.879 --> 15:03.045
White Russian.

15:03.079 --> 15:05.045
Oh, my goodness, no, no, no.

15:05.079 --> 15:06.945
Ah, many people
make that mistake.

15:06.979 --> 15:09.045
I'm actually
an olive skinned Myposian.

15:09.079 --> 15:11.512
Balki, it's a drink.

15:11.545 --> 15:13.512
Oh, that White Russian!

15:13.545 --> 15:15.079
Coming up.

15:15.112 --> 15:17.179
‐ Hup, ho!
‐ Ho!

15:17.212 --> 15:18.579
Ice.

15:18.612 --> 15:20.979
‐ Nice.
‐ Ice.

15:21.012 --> 15:22.712
Nice twice.

15:22.745 --> 15:24.679
‐ Vodka.
‐ Alodka.

15:24.712 --> 15:26.079
Oh, hup.

15:26.112 --> 15:29.179
Ho. Hey.

15:29.212 --> 15:30.579
Kahlua.

15:30.612 --> 15:32.512
For you‐a.

15:32.545 --> 15:33.879
‐ Hup. Ho!
‐ 'Ho!'

15:37.979 --> 15:39.412
Cream.

15:39.445 --> 15:40.512
A dream.

15:40.545 --> 15:42.912
Hup, ho!

15:44.012 --> 15:45.045
Swizzle.

15:45.079 --> 15:45.879
A bizzle.

15:47.879 --> 15:50.812
[all clapping]

15:53.445 --> 15:55.445
I thought you guys
were just passengers.

15:55.479 --> 15:57.112
Oh, no, no, no.
Uh, we work for the airline.

15:57.145 --> 15:59.612
We're, uh,
quality control experts.

16:01.079 --> 16:03.679
Yes, whenever we find quality..

16:03.712 --> 16:04.945
...we try to control it.

16:07.645 --> 16:08.845
Don't go away, anybody.

16:08.879 --> 16:09.912
You don't wanna miss
the dinner show.

16:12.179 --> 16:13.879
[applauding]

16:17.879 --> 16:18.845
Balki.

16:20.645 --> 16:22.112
Balki.

16:22.145 --> 16:24.112
Balki, this is great.

16:24.145 --> 16:25.812
For the first time,
I'm helping Jennifer

16:25.845 --> 16:26.912
out of a jam
I didn't get her into.

16:30.645 --> 16:33.479
Come on. Let's get
the dinners ready.

16:33.512 --> 16:35.545
(Hogan)
'Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Captain Hogan again.'

16:35.579 --> 16:36.979
'Please fasten your seat belts.'

16:37.012 --> 16:38.545
'It appears,
we'll be experiencing'

16:38.579 --> 16:39.545
'a little turbulence.'

16:41.179 --> 16:43.412
Cousin..

16:43.445 --> 16:44.712
...what‐what is turbulence?

17:00.879 --> 17:03.512
Is‐is that regular?

17:03.545 --> 17:06.079
‐ Yes, it is.
‐ Oh, good.

17:06.112 --> 17:07.479
‐ Aah!
‐ Aah!

17:07.512 --> 17:08.444
Yeah.

17:08.479 --> 17:10.444
Is that decaf?

17:10.479 --> 17:11.744
Yes, it is.

17:16.012 --> 17:18.145
‐ Cream or sugar?
‐ Yes, please.

17:18.179 --> 17:19.579
Aah!

17:19.612 --> 17:23.112
Well, the cream
is‐is by your left foot

17:23.145 --> 17:25.811
and, uh, the sugar..

17:25.845 --> 17:27.912
...sugar is bad for you.

17:31.445 --> 17:34.145
Hey, you, muck!
My baked potato's cold.

17:34.179 --> 17:37.045
Let me heat that up for you.

17:37.079 --> 17:38.845
Will you get these dirty trays?

17:38.879 --> 17:40.879
Dirty trays?
We haven't even eaten yet.

17:40.912 --> 17:42.179
‐ Yeah.
‐ Yeah, when are we gonna eat?

17:42.212 --> 17:44.879
I'll‐I'll get your dinners
out as fast as I can.

17:55.545 --> 17:56.845
Balki, help me.

18:01.112 --> 18:04.612
Balki, rows 22 through 24
still need their dinners.

18:04.645 --> 18:05.812
and‐and we've got
to pick up the trays

18:05.845 --> 18:07.745
from rows 19 through 21.

18:07.779 --> 18:09.879
23a wants a club soda
with a twist

18:09.912 --> 18:12.512
and 86 the 7 and 7 on, uh, 26b.

18:12.545 --> 18:14.145
10‐4, cousin.

18:14.179 --> 18:15.912
Listen..

18:15.945 --> 18:18.012
...who gets
the veterinarian supper?

18:18.045 --> 18:19.779
‐ Uh, 19c.
‐ Okay.

18:19.812 --> 18:21.512
Oh. Oh. Potato's ready.

18:22.679 --> 18:24.945
‐ Ow!
‐ Oh‐oh, cousin!

18:24.979 --> 18:27.045
‐ Ooh.
‐ Aah! Aah!

18:27.079 --> 18:28.412
Aah! Aah!

18:28.445 --> 18:31.679
Ow. Ow. Ooh. Ooh.

18:31.712 --> 18:32.879
‐ Aah.
‐ Ooh! Aah!

18:32.912 --> 18:33.945
Ow! Ow!

18:33.979 --> 18:36.079
Ow! Ow! Ow!

18:36.112 --> 18:37.679
Ow! Ow! Ow!

18:37.712 --> 18:38.779
Thank you.

18:42.212 --> 18:43.579
You, pick up the dirty trays.

18:43.612 --> 18:45.012
I‐I'll fix the rest
of the dinners.

18:45.045 --> 18:46.712
Okay.

18:46.745 --> 18:49.512
‐ 'Hey, what's taking so long?'
‐ 'Yeah, what's going on?'

18:49.545 --> 18:51.745
‐ I‐I just..
‐ Where's my vegetarian meal?

18:51.779 --> 18:54.179
Oh, sir, I‐I know
just where it is.

18:54.212 --> 18:55.879
It's in
the Mr. microphone oven.

18:55.912 --> 18:56.712
I'll go get it.

19:00.879 --> 19:02.945
‐ There.
‐ 'Hey, hey, hey. Wait!'

19:02.979 --> 19:04.045
Wait a minute, now.
They‐they've already eaten.

19:04.079 --> 19:05.545
That should be our food.

19:05.579 --> 19:07.812
It's mine now, buddy.

19:07.845 --> 19:08.879
Alright.

19:08.912 --> 19:09.845
Here‐here you go.

19:13.712 --> 19:14.779
Here you go, sir.

19:14.812 --> 19:16.979
One veterinarian supper.

19:17.012 --> 19:18.479
But this is steak.
I'm a vegetarian.

19:18.512 --> 19:19.645
Well, I added that.

19:19.679 --> 19:21.145
Our veterans deserve the best.

19:28.079 --> 19:29.679
There you go.

19:29.712 --> 19:30.479
‐ Thank you.
‐ Yeah.

19:32.045 --> 19:34.945
You promised to get me
a brownie, dear.

19:34.979 --> 19:36.445
Well, I think
they're out of them, dear.

19:36.479 --> 19:38.412
I want a brownie!

19:38.445 --> 19:41.012
Uh, I think, I can get you
an extra brownie.

19:41.045 --> 19:42.812
Thank you.

19:42.845 --> 19:45.479
Why does the broad
get an extra brownie?

19:45.512 --> 19:48.645
Broad? Hey, you can't call my
bride a broad, buddy.

19:48.679 --> 19:49.912
You wanna step outside?

19:49.945 --> 19:51.479
‐ Yeah. I'd like to.
‐ Well, come on.

19:51.512 --> 19:54.645
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

19:54.679 --> 19:56.612
Look, I know we're all
a little irritable

19:56.645 --> 19:57.845
because we haven't eaten‐‐

19:57.879 --> 19:59.179
Yeah, and it's all your fault.

19:59.212 --> 20:00.679
‐ Yeah, when are we gonna eat?
‐ 'Yeah!'

20:00.712 --> 20:01.979
Let's take over the kitchen.

20:02.012 --> 20:03.079
(all)
Yeah.

20:03.112 --> 20:05.612
Cousin, need some help?

20:05.645 --> 20:08.879
Hey, why are you on a coffee
break when I'm starving?

20:08.912 --> 20:11.512
Yeah, let's get our own food.

20:11.545 --> 20:13.645
Hold it right there!

20:13.679 --> 20:15.812
One more step, and no movie!

20:17.479 --> 20:18.512
My God!

20:18.545 --> 20:20.045
I think he means it!

20:20.079 --> 20:21.712
What is the movie anyway?

20:21.745 --> 20:23.479
Oh, it's a good one.

20:23.512 --> 20:24.879
"Ernest goes to camp."

20:24.912 --> 20:26.445
Get him!

20:26.479 --> 20:27.979
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

20:28.012 --> 20:30.779
Now, just‐just get back,
funky cats.

20:33.079 --> 20:34.579
Now, I may be mistaken

20:34.612 --> 20:38.812
but I'm picking up some
bad vibes from you people.

20:38.845 --> 20:41.112
You're supposed to be going
off to have a nice vacation.

20:41.145 --> 20:43.579
Why aren't you happy
and joyful?

20:43.612 --> 20:45.445
Why are you acting
like a lunch mob?

20:47.879 --> 20:50.612
Because you're the worst flight
attendants we've ever seen.

20:50.645 --> 20:52.079
(all)
Yeah!

20:52.112 --> 20:53.912
Well, I got a hot flash for you.

20:53.945 --> 20:55.945
We're not flight attendants
at all.

20:55.979 --> 20:59.612
Here are your
flight attendants

20:59.645 --> 21:01.845
and they happen to be two
of the best in the business.

21:05.012 --> 21:06.579
Unfortunately, at the moment

21:06.612 --> 21:09.545
they're two of the sickest
in the business.

21:09.579 --> 21:10.712
Yeah, well, cry me a river.

21:10.745 --> 21:13.179
I paid good money for good
service and I'm not getting it.

21:13.212 --> 21:15.179
We understand that.

21:15.212 --> 21:16.512
The only reason
we're only doing this

21:16.545 --> 21:18.612
is to help these ladies out.

21:18.645 --> 21:19.912
I mean, if somebody complains

21:19.945 --> 21:22.812
they could lose their jobs.

21:22.845 --> 21:24.912
Look, look, is it‐is it
too much to ask

21:24.945 --> 21:26.879
that‐that we all just help
out a little ?

21:26.912 --> 21:29.612
Just sit down
and be patient

21:29.645 --> 21:31.912
and‐and we'll get to you.

21:31.945 --> 21:33.445
Think about it.

21:33.479 --> 21:35.579
You're fighting
over airline food.

21:38.579 --> 21:40.912
Yeah, he's got a point,
my brownie was awful.

21:40.945 --> 21:43.145
I thought the Jell‐O
was pretty good.

21:43.179 --> 21:43.945
But I'm still hungry.

21:46.945 --> 21:48.579
You know what?

21:48.612 --> 21:50.645
I don't know how‐how
Jennifer and Mary Anne

21:50.679 --> 21:53.979
serve dinner at all with the
plane bouncing around like this.

21:54.012 --> 21:55.979
(Hogan)
'Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Captain Hogan again.'

21:56.012 --> 21:58.612
'I think the turbulence
is finally behind us.'

21:58.645 --> 22:00.512
'Flight attendants may now
begin serving dinner.'

22:11.879 --> 22:14.179
(Balki)
'Girls, I'm glad
you're feeling better.'

22:14.212 --> 22:16.445
You know, Jennifer,
after trying to do your job

22:16.479 --> 22:19.512
I have a whole
new respect for you.

22:19.545 --> 22:21.145
No‐no‐not that I didn't
respect you before.

22:21.179 --> 22:23.412
Oh, no. I‐I understand.

22:23.445 --> 22:25.945
Oh, look.
Someone left their jacket.

22:25.979 --> 22:27.579
Jennifer, uh..

22:27.612 --> 22:29.445
Although you feel fine now

22:29.479 --> 22:30.745
I‐I‐I got to warn you

22:30.779 --> 22:33.645
that there is one
nasty little side effect.

22:33.679 --> 22:34.945
For about a week
you're going to have

22:34.979 --> 22:37.079
a very bad reaction to plaid.

22:38.579 --> 22:39.579
[chuckles]

22:41.871 --> 22:42.959
A bad reaction to plaid?

22:42.992 --> 22:43.859
Oh, Balki.

22:46.059 --> 22:47.259
Well, I guess, I'll turn
this in to lost and..

23:01.192 --> 23:02.726
[theme music]
