02:48.087 --> 02:50.578
Good job!

03:12.611 --> 03:14.818
Hi! Johnny Utah.

03:15.155 --> 03:18.240
Your 9 o'clock appointment is here.

03:34.383 --> 03:37.799
Special Agent John Utah,
day number one in LA. Welcome aboard.

03:37.887 --> 03:40.212
- Your record's impressive.
- Thank you.

03:40.306 --> 03:42.975
You may have been
in the top 2% of your class at Quantico...

03:43.058 --> 03:47.186
...but out here you have exactly
zero hours of experience in the field.

03:47.271 --> 03:49.145
You know nothing,
in fact, less than nothing.

03:49.231 --> 03:52.565
If you knew you knew nothing,
that'd be something, but you don't.

03:52.651 --> 03:53.185
Yes, sir.

03:53.277 --> 03:54.819
- You eat a solid breakfast?
- Sir?

03:54.904 --> 03:57.858
All food groups, avoiding caffeine, sugar?

03:57.948 --> 04:01.732
I like my people to be fit. We don't drink
and we sure as hell don't smoke!

04:01.827 --> 04:04.911
- Sir, I take the skin off chicken.
- Good man!

04:05.331 --> 04:08.118
This is us - Bank Robbery.

04:08.209 --> 04:10.830
You are now
in the world's bank robbery capital.

04:10.920 --> 04:14.502
<i>(Utah)</i> 1,322 last year in LA County.
Up 26% from the year before.

04:14.590 --> 04:17.341
That's correct.
We nailed over 1,000 of them.

04:17.426 --> 04:20.213
Miss Deer,
take a look at that for me. Thank you.

04:20.303 --> 04:23.803
D'you know
how we nail the bad guys, Utah?

04:23.891 --> 04:27.971
By crunching data,
good crime-scene work, good lab work...

04:28.062 --> 04:31.016
...and, most importantly,
good data-based analysis.

04:31.106 --> 04:35.056
Special Agent Utah,
are you receiving my signal?

04:35.819 --> 04:38.441
Zero distortion, sir.

04:38.948 --> 04:41.486
I love these things.

04:44.203 --> 04:49.826
You're a real blue-flame special, son:
Young, dumb and full of cum. I know.

04:50.084 --> 04:55.326
What I don't know is how you got yourself
assigned out here to LA with us.

04:55.589 --> 04:57.214
I mean, hell...

04:57.299 --> 05:00.419
...I guess we must have
ourselves an asshole shortage, huh?

05:02.304 --> 05:04.380
Not so far.

05:12.690 --> 05:14.563
OK...

05:14.650 --> 05:16.559
- Pappas?
- Yeah?

05:16.652 --> 05:21.777
Put on the blindfold. I want to see you
retrieve at least two bricks off the bottom.

05:21.866 --> 05:24.154
One...

05:24.577 --> 05:26.450
...two.

05:26.537 --> 05:27.996
<i>(blows whistle)</i>

05:29.957 --> 05:31.748
I've been in the field 22 years...

05:31.834 --> 05:35.001
...l've fired my piece
over 19 times in the line of duty.

05:35.087 --> 05:38.871
I got no idea what a blind man fetching
bricks from the bottom of the pool...

05:38.966 --> 05:41.422
...has got to do with being a special agent.

05:41.510 --> 05:47.015
Added to which indignity, I have been
saddled with a blue-flame Quantico cat!

05:47.183 --> 05:50.765
Some quarterback punk.
Johnny Unitas or something.

05:51.103 --> 05:52.977
- The shit they pull, huh?
- Yeah!

05:53.063 --> 05:55.899
Hey, Angie? Here's your guy!

05:56.066 --> 05:58.355
What?

06:00.696 --> 06:04.646
<i>(sighs)</i> Uh... Pappas. Angelo Pappas.

06:04.742 --> 06:06.402
Punk. Quarterback punk.

06:06.493 --> 06:07.323
Hm.

06:07.411 --> 06:09.320
Welcome to SeaWorld, kid.

06:09.914 --> 06:10.993
<i>(man)</i> Good luck, Pappas.

Two bricks, comin' up.

06:28.724 --> 06:31.262

06:31.352 --> 06:34.851
- Everybody freeze!
- Nobody move! Hands up and eyes down!

06:35.064 --> 06:38.599
Back away from the counters!
Hands on your heads now!

06:39.360 --> 06:42.645
Everybody, onto the floor!
Move it! Move it!

06:43.113 --> 06:46.364
- Now! Get down!
- What's the matter with you people?

06:46.450 --> 06:48.656
You, outta the cubicle. Get outta my way!

06:48.786 --> 06:50.778
Back away and get your fuckin' hands up!

06:50.871 --> 06:54.323
Hey, what's the matter with you?
You got earwax?

06:54.416 --> 06:58.414
Back away! Keep your hands
where I can see 'em! Hands up!

06:58.504 --> 07:03.130
Hello, hello, ladies and gentlemen.
We are the Ex-Presidents!

07:03.217 --> 07:05.755
We need just a few moments of your time.

07:05.845 --> 07:09.379
We've been screwing you for years,
so a few more seconds shouldn't matter!

07:09.473 --> 07:14.135
On the floor, asshole! The money's
insured so it's not worth dying for!

07:16.981 --> 07:18.060
How you doin', Dick?

07:18.148 --> 07:21.564

Air Force One is waiting, Mr President.

07:38.460 --> 07:40.287
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

07:41.130 --> 07:43.881
Get your hands

07:43.966 --> 07:47.916
Thank you very much.
And, please, don't forget to vote!

God. In and out in 90 seconds!

08:04.612 --> 08:08.360
No-one ever gets shot.
Now, what are we talking about here?

08:08.449 --> 08:11.154
We're talking about solid professionals!

08:11.243 --> 08:12.406
Good moves.

08:12.494 --> 08:18.331
Yeah, they control the room well
and they stick strictly to the cash drawers.

08:18.417 --> 08:20.244
They don't go for the vault?

08:20.336 --> 08:23.502
No. They never go for the vault.
They never get greedy.

08:23.589 --> 08:25.747
Smart. You burn time in the vault.

08:25.841 --> 08:28.213
Reagan usually does the driving.

08:28.302 --> 08:33.047
Stolen switch car, they leave it running.
It looks parked from a distance.

08:33.140 --> 08:37.304
When they run,
they dump the vehicle and they vanish.

08:37.394 --> 08:39.268
Like a virgin on prom night.

08:39.355 --> 08:41.227
I mean, they vanish! Pshht!

08:43.192 --> 08:46.727
Surgical.
Look at them separate the dye pack.

08:46.820 --> 08:48.730
Dick and Ronnie know theirjobs.

08:48.822 --> 08:52.238
The Ex-Presidents
are the best I've ever seen.

08:52.326 --> 08:57.035
Any time you two've finished jerking off,
watching MTV, we need to see the tapes.

08:57.122 --> 09:00.954
Pappas, you tell the kid
your theory on the Presidents?

09:01.669 --> 09:03.875
Just take the tapes and go, Babbit.

09:03.963 --> 09:08.340
Hang ten, Pappas. Like totally rad, dude!

09:09.593 --> 09:11.669
I tell ya, the department loves it.

09:11.762 --> 09:13.802
What's he talking about, Angelo?

09:13.889 --> 09:17.638
- Found the drop car on Mulholland Drive.
- We'll go work it.

09:17.726 --> 09:19.802
<i>(Pappas)</i> Oh, no!

09:19.895 --> 09:22.184
Angelo?

09:22.273 --> 09:23.435
Come on!

09:23.524 --> 09:26.394
Thank you. We'll go work it.

09:26.485 --> 09:27.351
Good.

09:27.444 --> 09:28.476
Excuse me.

09:30.447 --> 09:34.397
I'm working a fuckin' drop car!
I don't believe it. Working a drop car!

09:34.493 --> 09:37.067
Pappas - what a hard-on!

09:37.788 --> 09:40.706
- <i>(man #1</i>) Keep away from there.
- <i>(man #2</i>) All right.

09:40.791 --> 09:42.997
<i>(men call instructions)</i>

09:45.462 --> 09:48.333
This car doesn't have AC.
Today was a scorcher.

09:48.424 --> 09:50.962
Sweat secretions in the seatbacks.

09:53.762 --> 09:55.506
Are you through, Mr Wizard?

09:55.598 --> 09:59.547
Let me know if you find Jimmy Hoffa
under the seat while you're at it!

10:02.479 --> 10:05.480
Oh, look at this!
It's <i>7.30</i>. The night is still young.

10:05.566 --> 10:09.646
The way you're going, you'll be able
to solve this case and start another one.

10:09.737 --> 10:12.228
Drop car, my ass! Goddamn!

10:15.201 --> 10:17.988
You been working Bank Robbery,
what, 22 years?

10:18.078 --> 10:20.748
Yeah, 22 years.

10:20.831 --> 10:22.871
LA has changed a lot during that time.

10:22.958 --> 10:25.081
The air got dirty and the sex got clean.

10:25.169 --> 10:28.704
A guy with that much time in
must have a theory about these guys.

10:28.797 --> 10:30.790
Leave it alone, Johnny.

10:30.883 --> 10:34.715
OK, fine, you've given up, fine.
It doesn't mean I have to.

10:34.803 --> 10:39.264
Hey! Listen, forget about it, kid.
They are ghosts.

10:39.350 --> 10:44.177
Of course. If <i>you</i> couldn't crack it
with all your years of experience...

10:44.271 --> 10:47.771
...it's impossible to think
I might have something to offer!

10:47.858 --> 10:50.729
Maybe I <i>can</i> do better
than an over-the-hill burnout.

10:50.819 --> 10:51.899
Watch your mouth!

10:51.987 --> 10:58.239
Maybe you should just retire, get some
rent-a-cop nightjob and tell 'Nam stories!

10:58.494 --> 11:04.200
Listen! I was taking shrapnel in 'Nam
while you were crapping in your hands!

11:04.291 --> 11:06.367
- You mad?
- Yeah, I'm mad.

11:06.460 --> 11:07.491
Good and mad?

11:07.586 --> 11:11.536
- Yeah. What you wanna do about it?
- Feels good, like you're still alive?

11:11.632 --> 11:12.379
Yeah!

11:12.466 --> 11:16.594
Well, since you're still alive
and you're not in the box just yet...

11:16.679 --> 11:21.091
...why don't you tell me this theory
of yours and we'll go get these guys?

11:22.977 --> 11:25.894
OK, hotshot.

11:26.272 --> 11:29.475
You wanna nail the bank robbers
and be a big hero?

11:30.609 --> 11:32.898
- Definitely!
- Definitely.

11:32.987 --> 11:34.529
Then here it is.

11:34.738 --> 11:37.229
The Ex-Presidents...

11:37.449 --> 11:38.730
...are surfers.

11:40.077 --> 11:41.275
Surfers.

11:41.370 --> 11:42.829
Surfers.

11:43.414 --> 11:44.659
It's in our face.

11:44.957 --> 11:47.329
Look at the tan line on this guy.

11:47.418 --> 11:49.327
Oh, well, he <i>must</i> be a surfer!

11:49.837 --> 11:51.035
Well, yeah.

11:51.130 --> 11:55.673
Last year, Nixon scuffs the counter
when he's going over...

11:56.343 --> 11:59.463
...so there is a soil sample.

12:00.097 --> 12:04.510
Non-specific mud.
Traces of asphalt, traces of oil.

12:04.602 --> 12:07.389
Traces of sand. Carnuba wax.

12:07.479 --> 12:12.474
So I become a wax expert.
Now, there's 80-some uses for this stuff.

12:12.568 --> 12:14.442
Something like 500 products.

12:14.528 --> 12:17.446
Candle wax, car wax, moustache wax.

12:18.199 --> 12:19.657
Could be anything.

12:20.743 --> 12:24.610
Guy's waxing his moustache
at the beach, gets sand in it...

12:24.705 --> 12:26.781
...takes it off with a shoe.

12:26.874 --> 12:28.617
Shoe scuffs the counter...

12:28.709 --> 12:32.956
Would you just shut up a minute!
Listen! Maybe you'll learn something.

12:33.047 --> 12:35.834
The lab gave us three possible matches.

12:35.925 --> 12:37.300
This is one of them.

12:38.010 --> 12:39.919
- Sex Wax!
- Yeah.

12:40.012 --> 12:42.088
You're not into kinky shit, are you?

12:42.181 --> 12:46.179
Not yet! Surfers use this.
They rub it on their boards for traction.

12:46.268 --> 12:47.597
Thanks for the tip.

12:47.686 --> 12:50.308
You're welcome for the tip.
Here's another.

12:50.397 --> 12:53.683
Check out the dates on these robberies.

12:53.859 --> 12:56.860
It's strictly a summerjob for these idiots.

12:57.446 --> 12:59.024
Four months.

12:59.907 --> 13:01.698
June to October.

13:03.452 --> 13:07.236
- Same the year before.
- That's right. We have one more month.

13:07.665 --> 13:10.156
We won't see 'em till next summer.

13:10.876 --> 13:14.328
They're travelling on the money,
going where the waves are.

13:14.964 --> 13:16.422
That's right!

13:17.967 --> 13:23.341
The Ex-Presidents rip off banks
to finance their endless summer!

13:23.430 --> 13:24.806
<i>(both)</i> Whoa!

13:26.642 --> 13:30.093
Hey, man,
a lot of guys your age are learning to surf.

13:30.187 --> 13:33.521
- It's cool. There's nothing wrong in it.
- I'm 25.

13:33.607 --> 13:36.181
That's what I'm saying. It's never too late.

13:37.820 --> 13:39.647
<i>(boy)</i> Hope you stick with it.

13:39.738 --> 13:42.609
Surfing's the source.
It can change your life.

13:45.619 --> 13:49.119
<i>(Utah)</i> Why can't I just walk around
with this thing under my arm...

13:49.248 --> 13:51.869

Well...

13:52.710 --> 13:53.955
...look.

13:56.046 --> 13:59.131
Look at 'em.
They're like some kinda tribe.

13:59.216 --> 14:00.960
They got their own language.

14:01.051 --> 14:02.925
You can'tjust walk up to those guys.

14:03.012 --> 14:08.089
You gotta get out there, learn the moves,
get into their head, pick up the speech.

14:08.183 --> 14:11.019
You saying
the FBI is going to pay me to learn to surf?

14:11.103 --> 14:13.772
It's either you or me on the board.
Get my drift?

14:13.856 --> 14:16.643
This is for rubber people
who don't shave yet.

14:16.734 --> 14:21.894
Come on. You're the quarterbackjock.
It's all balance, right? And co-ordination.

14:22.281 --> 14:23.859
How hard can it <i>be?</i>

14:53.062 --> 14:54.342

15:44.989 --> 15:47.693
It's all right. Come on. You're OK.

15:53.956 --> 15:56.447
<i>(coughs and splutters)</i>

15:57.209 --> 15:59.166
You crazy son of a bitch.

You wanna commit suicide,
you do it someplace else!

16:04.425 --> 16:05.670
<i>(coughs)</i>

16:07.261 --> 16:09.930
This pig-board piece of shit!

16:10.764 --> 16:13.255
You got no business out here whatsoever!

16:19.857 --> 16:21.434
Hey!

16:21.692 --> 16:23.732
My name's Johnny Utah!

16:23.819 --> 16:25.895
Who cares?!

17:33.556 --> 17:35.714
<i>That</i> is your surfing contact?

17:36.850 --> 17:40.718
"Female, blue eyes, black hair...

17:40.980 --> 17:43.352
...five foot six, 119 pounds."

What else they got on her?

18:05.004 --> 18:09.048
I still haven't found anything I can use.
I gotta find an approach. A way in.

18:09.133 --> 18:11.209
Here we go!

18:11.385 --> 18:13.543
Both parents deceased.

18:14.138 --> 18:16.925
Aeroplane crash, San Diego, '84.

18:18.642 --> 18:19.508
Yeah.

18:20.978 --> 18:22.009
Definitely.

18:38.120 --> 18:40.029
See ya later.

18:44.335 --> 18:45.497
Next?

18:47.880 --> 18:49.422
What do you want?

18:49.506 --> 18:50.502
Shrimp and fries.

18:52.468 --> 18:55.219
I mean, what do you want?
Why d'you keep hanging around?

18:55.304 --> 18:56.584
I need you to teach me.

18:56.680 --> 18:58.720
Gimme a break. Shrimp and fries...

18:59.350 --> 19:01.223
...to go!

19:01.644 --> 19:04.514
Would you like
something to drink with that, sir?

19:04.605 --> 19:08.104
- I'm serious!
- I can see that you're serious. Forget it.

19:08.692 --> 19:10.768
Stick to... tennis.

19:10.945 --> 19:12.854
I don't know, whatever you do good.

19:12.947 --> 19:15.272
Miniature golf. Your number's 3 <i>7.</i>

19:15.491 --> 19:19.441
You don't understand.
I'm gonna learn to surf or break my neck.

19:20.829 --> 19:25.207
What is it? You all of a sudden got this bug
that you just have to go surfing?

19:27.294 --> 19:28.753
This is a line, right?

19:28.837 --> 19:31.126
No! No.

19:32.007 --> 19:32.921
See...

19:34.885 --> 19:37.590
My whole life
I've done things for other people.

19:37.680 --> 19:41.013
In high school I played football
because my old man expected me to.

19:41.100 --> 19:41.799
Mm-hm.

19:41.892 --> 19:45.012
Then my parents
always figured I'd go to law school.

19:45.104 --> 19:47.476
So I did. Football scholarship.

19:47.565 --> 19:50.316
- Is this gonna take a long time?
- Wait.

19:51.527 --> 19:54.018
So I'm a big hero to my folks, right?

19:54.321 --> 19:57.690
But two years ago
they were killed in a car wreck.

19:58.868 --> 20:01.703
You can't imagine it.
Your whole life changes.

20:02.663 --> 20:06.708
And I suddenly realised
that all my goals had been their goals...

20:06.792 --> 20:11.288
...and I hadn't been living my own life,
so I wanted something for myself.

20:14.049 --> 20:16.623
So I come out here
from Ohio a month ago.

20:17.094 --> 20:19.763
I'd never seen the ocean before. Any ocean.

20:20.180 --> 20:23.098
I never thought
it would affect me so much.

20:23.517 --> 20:24.762
I'm drawn to it.

20:25.853 --> 20:26.884
Or something.

20:28.063 --> 20:30.186
I want to do what you do.

20:31.400 --> 20:33.938
It's the truth.

20:39.033 --> 20:40.741
All right.

20:40.910 --> 20:41.989
OK. Tomorrow.

20:42.077 --> 20:43.192
Here.

20:43.287 --> 20:44.746
6am!

20:45.289 --> 20:48.206
If you are one minute late, I'm gone.

20:49.168 --> 20:51.873
And, stud,
I didn't take you on to raise, so...

20:51.962 --> 20:56.957
...l'll teach you a few things and then
after that you'll be on your own, OK?

20:57.301 --> 20:58.416

You're dragging your foot,
you're gonna be fish food.

21:30.793 --> 21:34.493
Both feet have to land
on the board at the same time.

- What's he searching for?
- The ride! The ultimate ride.

- Two years of surgery, missed my window.

...does either one of you have anything
even remotely interesting to tell me?

28:27.751 --> 28:31.037

Goddamn it!

Anyway, what's his problem?
We're handling our caseload.

28:41.599 --> 28:45.431
- I'm surfing on my own time.
- I know, just don't rub Harp's nose in it.

28:45.519 --> 28:47.891
You think I joined the FBI to learn to surf?

28:47.980 --> 28:51.563
This was your lame idea.
You gotta back me up on this.

29:22.473 --> 29:25.509
Beaches are always being closed
because of waste spills.

29:25.601 --> 29:29.978
And surfers are territorial.
They stick mostly to certain breaks.

29:30.064 --> 29:33.433
If we can get hair samples
and get a match at a certain beach...

36:04.500 --> 36:08.200
No, but there's four guys
back there you might wanna check out!

36:08.295 --> 36:09.955
Thanks, buddy!

36:10.047 --> 36:12.964
- Hope you find him.
- Don't worry, I will.

36:13.676 --> 36:16.001
You like to start shit, don't you?

36:17.346 --> 36:19.255
Who are those guys?

36:19.348 --> 36:20.511
Nazi assholes.

36:20.599 --> 36:23.269
The guy you dropped is Bunker Weiss...

36:23.352 --> 36:26.555
...the big one is War Child,
AKA Lupton Pitman.

36:26.647 --> 36:31.642
And the other two think they're
some kind of death squad around here.

36:31.735 --> 36:33.146
What's their programme?

36:33.237 --> 36:35.728
Brains are wired wrong,
they're into bad shit.

36:35.823 --> 36:37.198
Like what? Illegal shit?

36:37.283 --> 36:41.327
Maybe, I don't know.
That's not what I'm talking about.

36:41.412 --> 36:43.285
They only live to get radical.

36:43.372 --> 36:48.200
They don't understand the sea,
so they'll never get the spiritual side of it.

36:48.294 --> 36:51.413
You're not gonna
start chanting or anything, are ya?!

36:51.505 --> 36:53.581
<i>(laughs)</i> I might!

36:53.674 --> 36:55.133
This is me.

36:57.303 --> 37:02.463
So, uh, you still haven't figured out
what riding waves is all about, have you?

37:03.017 --> 37:04.427
It's a state of mind.

37:04.518 --> 37:07.602
It's that place
where you lose yourself and find yourself.

37:07.688 --> 37:10.013
You don't know it yet, but you've got it.

37:10.107 --> 37:14.686
I saw you with those guys, you're a pit bull.
They didn't back you down an inch.

37:14.778 --> 37:17.863
- And that is very rare in this world.
- Thanks for stepping in.

37:17.948 --> 37:19.442
De nada! Later!

37:19.742 --> 37:24.238
Oh, hey. I'm having some people over
at my house tonight if you wanna come.

37:24.330 --> 37:25.160
Sure. Where?

37:25.247 --> 37:27.738
- Come with Tyler. She knows.
- All right.

37:30.377 --> 37:34.956
Next time you leave your piece
and shield in the car, stay in sight! OK?

37:35.049 --> 37:35.629
OK, Dad.

37:35.716 --> 37:39.299
<i>(shouting, rock music blaring)</i>

37:39.637 --> 37:42.507
Yeah, I need you to run a plate for me.

37:42.598 --> 37:46.726
Two Denver four Sam
niner five niner, late-Seventies Jeep.

37:47.436 --> 37:48.847
<i>(shouting)</i>

37:51.273 --> 37:56.897
The jeep belongs to a Bunker Weiss,
my buddy. Guy's got quite a sheet.

37:56.987 --> 37:59.988
Yeah. Skip all that.
Give me the greatest hits.

38:00.074 --> 38:01.023
<i>(music off)</i>

38:01.116 --> 38:05.778
Felony: Possession of cocaine - good.
Felony: B & E - three months in juvey.

38:05.871 --> 38:10.866
Felony: Assault - postgraduate work
at Chino. Excellent! I'm loving it!

38:11.377 --> 38:14.247
<i>(Utah)</i> These guys really fit the profile.

38:14.838 --> 38:16.796
I say we lay it on Harp.

38:17.591 --> 38:21.126
<i>(rock music, laughing, shouting)</i>

38:24.431 --> 38:26.471
<i>(Utah)</i> Here comes the night shift.

38:32.606 --> 38:37.185
This is bullshit. This is a bullshit lead.
This is totally bullshit.

38:37.278 --> 38:40.693
Harp must be fuckin' desperate
if he's listening to you two flakes.

38:40.781 --> 38:42.738
See you bright and early, guys.

38:42.825 --> 38:44.734
Yeah, right(!)

38:47.288 --> 38:50.372
Cold pizza for you.
It's good for breakfast. See you.

38:53.877 --> 38:56.369
<i>(Utah)</i> When did Harp say
we'd get the warrant?

38:56.463 --> 39:00.164
First thing. Get some sleep.
This could be an interesting morning.

39:36.754 --> 39:38.581
- Hey!
- Hey, Bodhi.

39:47.431 --> 39:49.507
I taught him that trick.

39:50.684 --> 39:52.760
I like it!

39:52.937 --> 39:55.724
Watch yourself. She's a wild one.

39:55.814 --> 39:59.065
Make yourself at home.
What's mine is yours.

40:03.155 --> 40:05.444
Man, itjacks up.

40:05.532 --> 40:10.491
You drop down into the pit.
It's 25 feet straight down...

40:10.579 --> 40:15.040
...and your balls, man,
your balls are about this big.

40:15.125 --> 40:17.830
And the whole thing's fuckin' roaring.

40:18.379 --> 40:23.254
Pushing you forward,
like you're on a freight train or something.

40:24.301 --> 40:29.212
Yeah, and if you lose it,
the fish'll be picking you out of the coral.

40:29.390 --> 40:32.225
Big-wave riding's
for macho assholes with a death wish.

40:32.518 --> 40:35.602
No, it's not. It's the ultimate rush.

40:35.688 --> 40:38.392
There's nothing that comes close to it.

40:38.691 --> 40:39.889
Not even sex.

40:40.025 --> 40:43.110
Maybe that's cos
you're not doing it right, Roach.

40:44.280 --> 40:47.649
Just paddling out
in a big surf is total commitment.

40:47.741 --> 40:52.487
You can'tjust call time-out
if you don't like the way things are going.

40:53.414 --> 40:55.157
So, what's biggest? Waimea?

40:55.249 --> 40:56.624
- Ridden?
- Yeah.

40:56.709 --> 40:57.574
McCaha.

40:57.751 --> 40:58.665
Dana Point.

40:58.836 --> 41:01.125
Bells Beach, Australia.

41:01.213 --> 41:04.629
No way Bells is bigger than Waimea, bro.

41:04.717 --> 41:06.294
It will be next year.

41:06.385 --> 41:09.421
Bodhi believes the 50-year storm
is coming next year.

41:09.555 --> 41:12.010
50-year storm. What's that?

41:12.141 --> 41:13.255
That's kind of a legend.

41:13.350 --> 41:15.806
No, it's real. It's absolutely real.

41:16.437 --> 41:18.228
Everything moves in cycles...

41:18.314 --> 41:23.141
...so twice a century the ocean
let's us know just how small we really are.

41:23.235 --> 41:26.569
A storm comes out of Antarctica,
tearing up the Pacific...

41:26.655 --> 41:30.949
...and it sends
a huge swell north 2,000 miles.

41:32.286 --> 41:37.280
And when it hits Bells Beach it'll turn into
the biggest surf this planet has ever seen.

41:37.374 --> 41:38.572
And I will be there.

41:38.667 --> 41:40.327
So will I.

41:40.669 --> 41:42.128
<i>(all whoop and yell)</i>

41:44.340 --> 41:48.005
If you want the ultimate,
you gotta be willing to pay the ultimate price.

41:50.262 --> 41:52.670
It's not tragic to die doing what you love.

41:52.765 --> 41:54.259
It's how I want to go.

41:54.350 --> 41:55.927
I ain't gonna live to see 30!

41:59.980 --> 42:02.471
There's too much testosterone here!

42:05.236 --> 42:07.727
<i>(laughter)</i>

42:40.563 --> 42:44.311
<i>(Tyler)</i>
Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies.

42:45.276 --> 42:50.151
Hope you're not buying into this banzai
bullshit like the rest of Bodhi's moonies!

42:52.992 --> 42:54.652
What are you talking about?

42:57.371 --> 43:00.906
You've got
that kamikaze look, Johnny. I've seen it.

43:01.750 --> 43:03.577
Bodhi can smell it a mile away.

43:05.379 --> 43:07.253
He'll take you to the edge.

43:08.007 --> 43:09.038
Past it.

43:09.466 --> 43:13.678
- Hey, Bodhi.
- Johnny has his own demons. Don't you?

43:16.098 --> 43:18.174
<i>(laughter and whooping)</i>

43:18.601 --> 43:20.095
What's going on?

43:24.732 --> 43:27.305
Here. A stealth mission. You up for it?

43:30.863 --> 43:32.939
- Let's do it!
- <i>(man)</i> Let's go!

43:44.126 --> 43:46.368
I can barely do this in broad daylight!

43:46.462 --> 43:49.498
Come on. At least
nobody's gonna see how bad you are.

44:12.488 --> 44:16.188
<i>- (Tyler)</i> I don't think he's ready for this.
<i>- (Bodhi)</i> He'll be fine.

44:20.955 --> 44:22.034
Shit!

Shit! Shit!

44:25.125 --> 44:26.157
Fuck!

44:39.014 --> 44:41.340
<i>(Utah)</i> I gotta be fuckin' crazy!

44:41.433 --> 44:42.928
But are you crazy enough?

44:44.061 --> 44:47.181
Yaaaaaa-hoooooo!

44:58.409 --> 45:00.615
Whooooo-hooooo!

45:00.703 --> 45:02.826
Can't see shit out here. I'm gonna die.

45:02.913 --> 45:05.700
Feel what the wave is doing,
then accept its energy.

45:05.791 --> 45:07.831
Get in sync, then charge with it.

45:08.002 --> 45:11.086
- You don't need to see.
- Yeah. Vision is overrated(!)

45:13.132 --> 45:17.841
OK, Johnny, this one's got your number on it.
Let's jam! Now paddle!

45:17.928 --> 45:22.674
Shit! I'm gonna die now.
I'm gonna fuckin' die now.

45:24.602 --> 45:27.519
Fuck...!

45:31.483 --> 45:33.191
Whoo! You're surfing, man!

45:36.363 --> 45:38.155
Whaaaaaaaah!

45:49.668 --> 45:51.994

45:52.838 --> 45:54.914
Yeah!

45:55.466 --> 45:56.545
Check it out!

45:56.717 --> 45:58.959
Is this not the best feeling on earth?

45:59.053 --> 46:00.595
Yeah!

46:00.763 --> 46:02.138
Whoo!

46:05.726 --> 46:07.802
Good break, Johnny.

46:08.520 --> 46:09.552
All right!

46:10.898 --> 46:12.522
Yeah.

46:25.329 --> 46:29.825
- Looks like we lost somebody!
- Yeah, leave the fire for them.

46:30.459 --> 46:32.582
<i>(man)</i> You wanna get something to eat?

46:32.670 --> 46:34.746

<i>(man)</i> Where's my clothes?
You seen my clothes?

46:42.638 --> 46:43.883
Yeah.

46:45.057 --> 46:47.429
I just wanna sit out here for a minute.

46:50.187 --> 46:52.263
Look at you.

46:52.940 --> 46:54.315
What?

46:54.400 --> 47:00.355
Usually you have this intense sort of
scowl of concentration on your face...

47:00.447 --> 47:04.944
...like you're doing all this
for a school project or something.

47:05.035 --> 47:08.155
Or like you've got something driving you.

47:11.125 --> 47:13.616
Look - it's gone.

47:16.880 --> 47:19.418
If I didn't know better...

47:19.508 --> 47:22.509

You don't have to.

He was working deep cover until...

You think I like this hair, man? Huh?

57:43.966 --> 57:46.255
You think I like these clothes?

57:46.343 --> 57:48.550
My wife wants me to stay at Ramada.

I've been working on these fuckers

57:53.767 --> 57:57.979
I finally got 'em to play Wheel Of Fortune

57:58.063 --> 58:01.230
- ...and you fuckin' cowboys show up.
- Nice tattoo, Dietz.

58:01.317 --> 58:02.894
You like that, Pappas? Fuck you.

58:02.985 --> 58:06.188
He has a record of your suspects'
movements over the last three months.

58:06.280 --> 58:11.321
All I wanna know, smart guy, is
how did they rob a bank on August 2nd...

58:11.410 --> 58:14.861
...when they were
in Fort fuckin' Lauderdale August 2nd?

58:14.955 --> 58:18.289
- Why don't you figure that out?
- It's not an easy thing to do, is it, Utah?

Hey, Bodhi!

59:37.329 --> 59:38.408
So, let's go!

59:38.497 --> 59:40.157

You gotta what?

01:00:52.821 --> 01:00:55.988
I forgot all about a meeting
I have this morning.

01:00:56.116 --> 01:00:59.532
I gottajam. Sorry. Really.
I'll call you later.

01:01:01.914 --> 01:01:04.072
So, I started trailing him.

The Zen surf master?

01:01:05.668 --> 01:01:08.337
Bodhi, yeah. I'm on him all day, right?

01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:12.963
He goes to Tower Records, buys some
CDs, has lunch at Patrick's Roadhouse...

01:01:13.050 --> 01:01:16.217
...he goes into the Assured Trust
Savings and Loan.

01:01:16.303 --> 01:01:17.382
Did he rob it?

01:01:17.471 --> 01:01:21.718
Cute! He's inside 20 minutes.
The other guy, Roach, waited in the truck.

01:01:21.809 --> 01:01:23.885
They were scoping it out, right?

01:01:23.978 --> 01:01:26.765
Well, they were scoping it out
or cashing a cheque.

01:01:26.855 --> 01:01:31.564
Wait. Then they go back home
and they box up all their shit.

01:01:31.652 --> 01:01:32.815
See, summer's over.

01:01:32.903 --> 01:01:37.115
They load it in Bodhi's truck
and they take it to a public storage unit.

01:01:37.199 --> 01:01:41.197
I lost them after that, but the house
is empty. They're definitely outta here.

01:01:41.829 --> 01:01:45.529
Goddamn it! Why didn't you call me?
They're probably halfway to Maui.

01:01:45.624 --> 01:01:50.370
Uh-uh, no. They've got to pick up
some travelling money first.

01:01:50.462 --> 01:01:55.587
Assured Trust tomorrow, next day latest.
I definitely got a feeling on this.

01:01:55.676 --> 01:01:58.593
Last time you had a feeling,
I had to kill a guy.

01:01:58.679 --> 01:02:01.087
I hate that. It looks bad on my report.

01:02:02.433 --> 01:02:07.344
Angelo, I'm right this time.
We can still win this one.

01:02:09.648 --> 01:02:10.229
OK.

01:02:11.942 --> 01:02:16.022

01:14:34.977 --> 01:14:36.388
You lied to me!

01:14:36.562 --> 01:14:38.934
Tyler, put the gun down.

01:14:39.148 --> 01:14:42.267
I bet you lied about everything.

01:14:43.527 --> 01:14:45.520
I bet you lied about your parents!

01:14:47.364 --> 01:14:50.199
You just tell me the truth, Johnny.

01:14:51.785 --> 01:14:54.537
Did your parents die in a car accident?

01:14:56.123 --> 01:14:57.036
DID THEY?!

01:15:00.127 --> 01:15:01.870
They live in Columbus, Ohio.

01:15:01.962 --> 01:15:05.462
I work Bank Robbery. The guys I'm after
are surfers. I needed you at first...

01:15:05.549 --> 01:15:07.376
- ...but after that...
- Fuck you!

01:15:07.885 --> 01:15:09.961
Don't you have a soul?

01:15:11.972 --> 01:15:13.003
<i>(drops gun)</i>

01:15:13.682 --> 01:15:15.011
Goddamn you to hell!

01:15:15.100 --> 01:15:16.132
Tyler...

01:15:17.019 --> 01:15:18.394
TYLER, WAIT!

01:15:19.730 --> 01:15:21.390
TYLER!

01:15:23.901 --> 01:15:28.112
- (answering machine) <i>Leave a messag</i> e.
<i>- (Utah)</i> Tyler, look, I fucked up. OK?

01:15:28.197 --> 01:15:29.821
I know I fucked up.

01:15:30.282 --> 01:15:32.690
I wanted to tell you, but I couldn't.

01:15:32.785 --> 01:15:36.485
I was afraid you'd leave.
Good guess, huh?

01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:40.281
Fuck!
Why can't I ever say what I really mean?

01:15:42.461 --> 01:15:46.625
(Utah) <i>I lied to you.</i>
<i>I'm an asshole, but I n</i> ee <i>d you, Tyler.</i>

Tyler, wait. I'm coming.

01:16:01.021 --> 01:16:02.978
Howdy, bro.

01:16:04.066 --> 01:16:05.726
So, come on, we're rollin'.

01:16:05.818 --> 01:16:08.356
What's going on, Bodhi?

01:16:08.445 --> 01:16:10.355
What happened?
Cut yourself shaving?

01:16:10.447 --> 01:16:12.903
I don't think I wanna surf right now.

01:16:12.992 --> 01:16:17.570
Surf? No, this is really different, Johnny,
you are gonna love it.

01:16:17.663 --> 01:16:21.114
So, we gotta get your stuff
and get outta here.

01:16:22.501 --> 01:16:24.577
<i>(Bodhi)</i> OK. Uh, socks...

01:16:26.297 --> 01:16:28.004
...shirt.

01:16:30.092 --> 01:16:31.919
Uh... boots. Here we go.

01:16:34.471 --> 01:16:38.516
OK, put the stuff on in the truck.
We gotta go. Life is short.

01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:41.222
You are gonna love this!

01:16:57.703 --> 01:16:58.734
Yo!

01:17:01.081 --> 01:17:03.157
All right, let's unload.

01:17:07.296 --> 01:17:11.128
- Take this, too.
- Thank you, sir. There you go.

01:17:11.216 --> 01:17:12.675
Ever done this before?

01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:14.966
No, but I've seen it on TV.

01:17:15.054 --> 01:17:16.845
It's 100% pure adrenaline.

01:17:16.930 --> 01:17:21.224
Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it.
All you gotta do is jump.

01:17:21.310 --> 01:17:24.809
I'm sure it's a blast,
but I screwed my knee up yesterday.

01:17:24.897 --> 01:17:29.808
Yeah, I noticed you limping, but don't
worry cos we're not gonna land on land.

01:17:29.902 --> 01:17:33.187
Well, fine then. I feel so much better(!)

01:17:33.697 --> 01:17:35.441
OK, let's fly.

01:17:47.044 --> 01:17:48.075
Three minutes.

01:17:48.170 --> 01:17:53.046
This is a ceremony we always do at the end
of the summer. One last speed star.

01:17:53.133 --> 01:17:57.001
By the way, you might wanna
pull that little orange thing sometime.

01:17:58.138 --> 01:18:00.808
The life you save may be your own.

01:18:00.891 --> 01:18:04.509
So, uh... who packed my chute?

01:18:04.603 --> 01:18:06.726
I did. Why? You don't trust me?

01:18:07.815 --> 01:18:09.143
You gotta earn trust.

01:18:09.233 --> 01:18:13.313
OK, we'll earn it together. Here, take mine.

01:18:14.613 --> 01:18:16.736
Hey, Johnny, that's not a good idea.

01:18:16.824 --> 01:18:20.773
Bodhi's packs are pretty shitty.
They only open about half the time.

01:18:20.869 --> 01:18:21.403
Less!

01:18:21.495 --> 01:18:22.526
Bullshit.

01:18:22.621 --> 01:18:26.453
Why don't you take
young Grommet's? How'd that be?

01:18:26.542 --> 01:18:30.705
Nah, you don't want this one, man.
This one's set for a neck-breaker.

01:18:30.796 --> 01:18:34.746
You'd probably
be better off with something like this.

01:18:35.718 --> 01:18:37.509
Are we gonnajump orjerk off?

01:18:37.678 --> 01:18:39.717
That's my man!

01:18:41.223 --> 01:18:43.216
Let's do it!

01:18:45.352 --> 01:18:49.931
You're about to jump out of a perfectly
good aeroplane. How you feel about that?

01:18:53.777 --> 01:18:57.229
<i>(joyful whooping)</i>

01:19:13.547 --> 01:19:16.631
Shit! Whoa, shit!

01:19:23.390 --> 01:19:25.881
Whoa-ho-ho!

01:19:37.321 --> 01:19:39.313
Sex with the gods!

01:19:39.406 --> 01:19:42.692
You can't beat this!

01:19:45.287 --> 01:19:47.327
This is fucking beautiful!

01:19:57.383 --> 01:19:59.459
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

01:20:08.644 --> 01:20:11.135
Ha-ha!

01:20:14.942 --> 01:20:17.018
Whew!

01:20:22.700 --> 01:20:27.741
Whoa! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

01:20:28.163 --> 01:20:29.195
Hah!

01:20:36.088 --> 01:20:38.246
Come on, Johnny.

01:21:01.822 --> 01:21:04.313
That's it, Johnny. Go for it.

01:21:04.616 --> 01:21:05.779
Come on, Johnny!

01:21:08.621 --> 01:21:11.408
You can do it. Come on!

01:21:14.043 --> 01:21:17.328
Use your arms. Fly like an eagle, baby.

01:21:17.588 --> 01:21:18.619
Whoo!

01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:23.793
Keep coming.

01:21:26.305 --> 01:21:27.550
All right!

01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:30.261
- Johnny, you did it.
- You're a speed star.

01:21:30.601 --> 01:21:33.056
We're going like a bat out o' hell.

01:21:33.145 --> 01:21:35.138
Whoo!

01:21:38.233 --> 01:21:39.644
How do you like it, Johnny?

01:21:40.319 --> 01:21:41.434
Amazing.

01:21:41.570 --> 01:21:43.776
Fucking amazing!

01:21:52.414 --> 01:21:58.250
This is so beautiful.
I love this ground-rush shit.

01:22:00.089 --> 01:22:02.295
OK. Break!

01:22:10.474 --> 01:22:11.933
Great, isn't it?

01:22:13.018 --> 01:22:15.141
You're doing good.

01:22:25.531 --> 01:22:28.236
A thousand feet, pull.

01:22:28.325 --> 01:22:31.575
After you, Alphonse. I insist.

01:22:38.294 --> 01:22:40.333
Pull the ripcord now.

01:22:40.421 --> 01:22:41.583
You first.

01:22:41.672 --> 01:22:42.835
OK!

01:22:42.923 --> 01:22:44.002
Son of a bitch!

01:22:47.303 --> 01:22:49.379
<i>(laughs)</i>

01:23:31.555 --> 01:23:33.631
Jesus Christ.

01:23:34.683 --> 01:23:36.759
I gotta be losing it.

01:23:43.942 --> 01:23:46.860
It's the closest you'll ever get to God.

01:23:47.071 --> 01:23:50.653
It's like the palm of your hand, man.
Zoom! Coming right at you.

01:23:50.741 --> 01:23:53.030
- Unbelievable.
- Totally indescribable.

01:23:53.118 --> 01:23:56.867
- We did pull <i>pretty</i> low.
- You'll never be the same again.

01:23:56.955 --> 01:23:59.826
- Didn't I tell you Johnny'd be just fine?
- Yeah. Damn perf!

01:23:59.917 --> 01:24:02.953
Johnny, just drop your chute right there.

01:24:04.088 --> 01:24:06.329
Pack off your shoulders.

01:24:06.423 --> 01:24:09.508
- Step back out of it.
- I'll pack that for you, Bodhi.

01:24:09.593 --> 01:24:10.922
OK. Thanks.

01:24:11.011 --> 01:24:14.546
Johnny, come here.
There's something you need to see.

01:24:17.017 --> 01:24:18.761
Hop in.

01:24:21.563 --> 01:24:23.390
OK.

01:24:27.653 --> 01:24:28.898
What's this?

01:24:29.113 --> 01:24:31.983
This is an insurance policy.

01:24:32.950 --> 01:24:36.948
It will sting a bit,
but it's for your own growth. Press <i>play.</i>

01:24:43.919 --> 01:24:44.950
<i>(growls)</i>

01:24:48.590 --> 01:24:50.500
Fuck you!

01:25:04.857 --> 01:25:06.730
<i>(Tyler screams)</i>

01:25:07.484 --> 01:25:09.691
(Tyler) <i>FUCK YOU!</i>

01:25:20.414 --> 01:25:23.865
She is a wild one,
isn't she, Special Agent Utah?

01:25:26.337 --> 01:25:27.535
You're a fuckin' dead man!

01:25:27.630 --> 01:25:30.465
Hold it, man. Think it through, man.

01:25:30.549 --> 01:25:34.677
I'm the only one that knows where she is.
I'm the only one...

01:25:34.762 --> 01:25:36.801
...so let me talk. Let me talk.

01:25:38.766 --> 01:25:39.715
Talk.

01:25:40.017 --> 01:25:42.508
She'll be fine. Rosie won't do anything...

01:25:42.603 --> 01:25:46.553
...as long as I meet him
at a certain place and time in six hours.

01:25:46.649 --> 01:25:50.433
You call him right now
and tell him to let her go!

01:25:50.527 --> 01:25:53.896
Sorry, I can't do it, bro.
They're on the road...

01:25:53.989 --> 01:25:58.485
...and where they're going,
there are no phones, so you are outta luck.

01:26:01.288 --> 01:26:02.948
<i>(coughs)</i>

01:26:07.169 --> 01:26:08.628
Oh, man.

01:26:09.546 --> 01:26:11.835
I hate this, Johnny. I really do.

01:26:11.924 --> 01:26:14.213
I hate violence.

01:26:14.301 --> 01:26:17.421
That's why I need Rosie.
I could never do that.

01:26:17.513 --> 01:26:20.633
I could never hold a knife to Tyler's throat.
She was my woman.

01:26:20.724 --> 01:26:22.800
We shared time.

01:26:22.935 --> 01:26:26.849
But Rosie is a... mechanism, you know?

01:26:27.189 --> 01:26:29.941
Once you set him in motion,
he will not stop.

01:26:30.609 --> 01:26:33.527
He's, like, got this gift of blankness.

01:26:35.406 --> 01:26:39.024
But when three o'clock comes
he will gut her like a pig...

01:26:39.159 --> 01:26:41.152
...and try not to get any on his shoes.

01:26:41.245 --> 01:26:43.617
There's nothing
I can do about it unless I get there.

01:26:44.456 --> 01:26:46.663
So I guess that makes us partners...

01:26:46.959 --> 01:26:50.410
...because we both have the same goal:
To get me where I need to go, right?

01:26:53.549 --> 01:26:54.924
We're wasting time.

01:26:57.094 --> 01:26:58.125
<i>(laughs)</i>

01:26:58.387 --> 01:27:03.428
That's what I love about you, Johnny.
You are just as sharp as a razor.

01:27:05.686 --> 01:27:09.351
Murphy, take the plane
down to Santa Monica, top up the tanks.

01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:12.773
- OK, you guys, it's party time. Move it!
- Right. We're on it.

01:27:25.331 --> 01:27:29.411
All I'm asking for
is 90 seconds of your life, Johnny.

01:27:32.671 --> 01:27:35.589
You see? It's basic dog psychology.

01:27:36.508 --> 01:27:40.043
If you scare them and get them
peeing down their leg, they submit.

01:27:40.596 --> 01:27:44.843
Yet if you project weakness, you draw
aggression. That's how people get hurt.

01:27:45.809 --> 01:27:49.759
You see, fear causes hesitation...

01:27:50.564 --> 01:27:54.265
...and hesitation
will cause your worst fears to come true.

01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:59.105
So it's simple.
You project strength to avoid conflict.

01:27:59.198 --> 01:28:01.736
Peace through superior firepower.

01:28:04.578 --> 01:28:05.609
Oh...

01:28:09.958 --> 01:28:14.170
There. Can't have you walking through
those doors with your dick in your hand.

01:28:17.466 --> 01:28:18.746
I can't do this.

01:28:19.009 --> 01:28:20.088
Sure you can.

01:28:20.594 --> 01:28:23.381
Who knows?
You might like it. It's a killer rush.

01:28:23.472 --> 01:28:26.259
Bodhi,
this is your fuckin' wake-up call, man!

01:28:26.350 --> 01:28:29.102
I am an FBI agent!

01:28:29.436 --> 01:28:31.512
I know, man. Isn't it wild?

01:28:31.605 --> 01:28:33.681
But that's what makes it great, Johnny.

01:28:33.774 --> 01:28:36.775
We can exist on a different plane,
we can make our own rules.

01:28:36.860 --> 01:28:39.945
Why be a servant to the law
when you can be its master?

01:28:40.030 --> 01:28:40.812
Fuckin' A!

01:28:40.948 --> 01:28:43.403
I love this fuckin' job.

01:28:43.492 --> 01:28:46.695
OK, 90 seconds, door to door.

01:28:47.871 --> 01:28:50.244
It's a small price to pay
for someone who loves you.

01:28:51.250 --> 01:28:53.207
She does, you know?

01:28:53.293 --> 01:28:57.790
It's not her style to fall so hard.
I don't think she did with me.

01:29:03.512 --> 01:29:05.303
OK, Mr Carter.

01:29:06.724 --> 01:29:08.384
LBJ.

01:29:09.059 --> 01:29:10.091
Mr Nixon.

01:29:19.695 --> 01:29:24.191
Well, sorry, Johnny.
Looks like you don't get to be president!

01:29:28.203 --> 01:29:29.484
I'm ready.

01:29:45.804 --> 01:29:47.678
Rock and roll!

01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:52.591
Everybody freeze!

01:29:54.021 --> 01:29:56.690
- OK. On the floor now!
- On the floor right now! Do it.

01:29:56.774 --> 01:29:59.525
Hold it! Where you going?

01:30:00.653 --> 01:30:02.729
Everybody down! Let's go!

01:30:06.367 --> 01:30:07.944
<i>(Utah)</i> On the floor, asshole!

01:30:08.035 --> 01:30:11.949
I'll blow out your fuckin' kneecaps,
then you'll be on the floor.

01:30:12.039 --> 01:30:13.866
A kick in the ass, ain't it, man?

01:30:13.957 --> 01:30:16.579
Hey, look. You're on TV. Smile.

01:30:17.628 --> 01:30:20.035
Could be a little hard to play FBI now, huh?

01:30:20.130 --> 01:30:22.621
Can we just get the goddamned money
and get out of here!

01:30:23.759 --> 01:30:26.676
Nobody move. Heads down, eyes down.

01:30:26.762 --> 01:30:30.629
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
May I have your attention, please?

01:30:30.724 --> 01:30:35.386
We are the Ex-Presidents and, as you can
see, we are, in fact, robbing your bank.

01:30:35.479 --> 01:30:39.311
So with a little co-operation
I won't have to blow your heads off.

01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:42.603
So I need just a couple of minutes
of your lives and we're gone.

01:30:43.904 --> 01:30:45.648
Dick, go to the vault.

01:30:48.409 --> 01:30:54.114
Uh... you, Miss Jennings, would you be a
dear and open the gate for my associate?

01:30:54.206 --> 01:30:55.617
Mr Duggan's got the keys.

01:30:55.708 --> 01:30:57.914
We never go to the vault!

01:30:58.002 --> 01:30:59.033
Just do it!

01:30:59.128 --> 01:31:02.497
Lyndon, go with them.
Get in the vault, man. Go! Go!

01:31:02.881 --> 01:31:04.839
Who's Mr fuckin' Duggan?!

01:31:04.925 --> 01:31:08.839
Mr Duggan, do you wanna
open the vault or do you want me to do it?

01:31:09.013 --> 01:31:10.637
Do whatever they want, Teri.

01:31:12.057 --> 01:31:14.133
Take the fucking keys! Take 'em!

01:31:16.061 --> 01:31:17.093
Move it!

01:31:19.189 --> 01:31:21.478
Open the damned door!

01:31:21.567 --> 01:31:25.102
I'll fuckin' blow
your fuckin' head off! Move it!

01:31:29.366 --> 01:31:31.240
Come on! Come on!

01:31:31.952 --> 01:31:32.983
Get outta the way!

01:31:33.078 --> 01:31:34.537
OK. All right.

01:31:34.621 --> 01:31:36.032
Go for the big bag.

01:31:36.123 --> 01:31:38.163
What we doin' in a fuckin' vault?!

01:31:39.251 --> 01:31:40.532
This is a bad idea.

01:31:43.005 --> 01:31:45.626
- <i>(screams)</i>
- On the ground. Don't look at me!

01:31:45.716 --> 01:31:49.796
You're blowing it, man. You're breaking
your own rules and pulling too much time.

01:31:49.887 --> 01:31:51.049
Jimmy, how we doing?

01:31:51.180 --> 01:31:52.923
65. What's happening?

01:31:53.349 --> 01:31:55.222
Don't worry, man, it's fine. It's great.

01:31:56.352 --> 01:31:58.012
Fuck! Fuck!

01:32:01.774 --> 01:32:04.347
(Hey, I'm a cop.)

01:32:04.568 --> 01:32:06.027
(So?)

01:32:08.864 --> 01:32:10.062
(I'm a cop.)

01:32:10.282 --> 01:32:12.571
(No... don't.)

01:32:12.660 --> 01:32:14.533
(You got a gun on your ankle?)

01:32:15.245 --> 01:32:15.910
(Yeah.)

01:32:16.497 --> 01:32:18.454
(When I make a move, you back me up.)

01:32:18.666 --> 01:32:22.117
- (Please, don't. You don't have to.)
- (You'll back me up.)

01:32:22.544 --> 01:32:25.118
(Don't do it. Don't do anything.)

01:32:25.214 --> 01:32:26.756
(No, don't! Don't!)

01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:30.256
(Please, put it away.
Please, put it away. Put it away.)

01:32:34.723 --> 01:32:36.217
Hurry up!

01:32:36.308 --> 01:32:38.384
Let's go, we gotta go!

01:32:39.311 --> 01:32:40.770
Fuckin' move!

01:32:43.482 --> 01:32:44.478
<i>(woman screams)</i>

01:32:44.608 --> 01:32:46.019
Federal agent. Undercover!

<i>(screaming)</i>

01:33:37.828 --> 01:33:40.070

<i>(whimpers)</i>

01:33:45.127 --> 01:33:47.700
You OK? Hang on, little bro.

01:33:47.838 --> 01:33:50.080
Come on,
we are outta here. We are outta here.

01:33:52.634 --> 01:33:55.422
Hang on, little brother. Just hang on, man.

01:33:57.222 --> 01:33:59.548
No, man. No!

01:34:00.267 --> 01:34:02.936
<i>(stops breathing)</i>

01:34:18.702 --> 01:34:20.825
Are you outta your fuckin' mind?

01:34:21.455 --> 01:34:26.283
What's the matter with you?! Is that what
you want? Did you get what you wanted?

01:34:26.377 --> 01:34:28.665
You can't take him with. LET'S GO!

01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:55.025
Goddamn it, who's in charge of this
camera crew? This is a crime-scene area!

01:34:55.114 --> 01:34:56.691
Get 'em the fuck outta here!

01:34:56.782 --> 01:34:58.822
You have the right to remain silent.

01:34:58.909 --> 01:35:02.243
Anything you say, can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

01:35:02.329 --> 01:35:05.947
If you so desire, an attorney
will be provided for you, free of cost.

01:35:06.041 --> 01:35:09.624
Do you understand
these rights I've just given you, Utah?

01:35:09.712 --> 01:35:13.246
D'you understand! Understand
the rights I've just read you, Utah?!

01:35:13.340 --> 01:35:17.089
He understands his goddamned rights!
Jesus Christ, kid, are you OK?

01:35:17.177 --> 01:35:19.051
Stand up. Get these cuffs off him.

01:35:19.138 --> 01:35:23.432
Leave 'em on! Your partner's
an accessory to murder, you understand?

01:35:23.517 --> 01:35:26.138
There are three dead people.
One's a police officer.

01:35:26.228 --> 01:35:29.348
Let me show you something, pal.
How does that sit in your stomach?

01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:33.188
Take your hands off me right now.

01:35:33.277 --> 01:35:34.557
Come on.

01:35:34.653 --> 01:35:36.895
Listen, look at me. Look at me!

01:35:36.989 --> 01:35:40.939
Don't send him in
with the black and whites, let me ride him in.

01:35:41.035 --> 01:35:42.826
Yeah, sure, Angelo, why not?

01:35:42.911 --> 01:35:45.449
That's why
I put you two together to begin with.

01:35:45.539 --> 01:35:48.326
You deserve each other.
You're just as bad as he is...

01:35:48.417 --> 01:35:51.537
...only you're a little fatter,
slower and more pathetic.

01:35:51.628 --> 01:35:53.087
It's like the blind leading the blind.

01:35:53.172 --> 01:35:59.424
Harp, I was in this Bureau when you were
still popping zits on your funny face...

01:35:59.720 --> 01:36:03.587
...and jackin' off to the lingerie section
of the Sears catalogue!

01:36:03.682 --> 01:36:04.963
Is that right, Pappas?

01:36:05.059 --> 01:36:10.184
Yes, that's right, and there's one thing
I've learnt that you still haven't got.

01:36:10.272 --> 01:36:13.392
Oh, yeah?
Why don't you astonish me, shit face?

01:36:17.237 --> 01:36:20.357
Respect for my elders, plain and simple.

01:36:20.824 --> 01:36:23.742
- Come on, kid, let's go.
- <i>(man)</i> Holy shit.

01:36:31.377 --> 01:36:33.085
I know where they're going.

01:36:34.755 --> 01:36:36.712
I figured you did.

01:36:37.841 --> 01:36:41.709
Santa Monica airport. Fast!
But we've got one minor problem.

01:36:41.804 --> 01:36:42.503
What?

01:36:42.596 --> 01:36:45.799
We can't arrest them or shoot them.

01:36:46.642 --> 01:36:47.756
What?!

01:36:54.358 --> 01:36:56.018
<i>(brakes scr</i> ee <i>ch)</i>

01:37:06.912 --> 01:37:08.572

01:37:08.664 --> 01:37:10.206
- One thousand.
- What?

01:37:10.290 --> 01:37:11.915
One thousand.

01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:15.533
Check the rigging, OK?

01:37:25.014 --> 01:37:26.176
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:37:28.100 --> 01:37:30.009
Fuckin' FBI.

01:37:30.644 --> 01:37:32.720
I'm not armed.

<i>(cocks gun)</i>

01:37:37.609 --> 01:37:39.851
But you're not alone.

01:37:39.945 --> 01:37:41.108
Good guess.

01:37:44.491 --> 01:37:47.658
There's a gun on you right now.

01:37:51.832 --> 01:37:53.160
Where's Roach?

01:37:53.459 --> 01:37:55.784
He's around somewhere.

01:37:57.087 --> 01:38:00.539
Listen, Johnny, we are in kind of a hurry.
What do you need?

01:38:00.632 --> 01:38:02.839
You gotta tell me where she is.

01:38:02.926 --> 01:38:05.797
And let my policy expire? Good idea.

01:38:06.055 --> 01:38:08.759
Look, Bodhi, people are dead.
The ride is over.

01:38:10.100 --> 01:38:13.303
Oh, no, no. I say when it's over.

01:38:14.021 --> 01:38:18.683
The guy you killed was an off-duty cop.
They'll nail you wherever you land.

01:38:18.776 --> 01:38:22.310
There's a new thing called radar.
Maybe you've heard of it.

01:38:22.404 --> 01:38:23.982
- What is your...
- <i>(engine)</i>

01:38:24.073 --> 01:38:25.733

When they fall on you,
you won't back down.

01:38:38.837 --> 01:38:41.245
They'll have to burn your ass to the ground!

01:38:41.340 --> 01:38:42.882
Uh-huh. And shit happens.

01:38:42.966 --> 01:38:48.174
Look, you got a death wish, fine,
but don't take Tyler with you.

01:38:48.263 --> 01:38:50.137
I'm begging you.

01:38:50.557 --> 01:38:53.393
Tell me where she is, then I walk away.

01:38:54.228 --> 01:38:55.342
You walk away?

01:38:55.437 --> 01:38:56.718
I walk away.

01:38:57.147 --> 01:38:59.140

- Come on, man, just hang on.
- I really fucked up.

01:40:15.559 --> 01:40:17.967
Just hang on. You'll be all right.

01:40:25.819 --> 01:40:27.812

Can I quit mowing the lawn here?

01:41:47.609 --> 01:41:50.563
Getting more bushes
in the wheels than I usually like.

01:41:50.654 --> 01:41:54.652
Shut your mouth and take it
to 4,000 feet on this heading, all right?

01:41:54.742 --> 01:42:00.495
I don't think that's such a good idea, man.
We'll pop up on their screens.

01:42:00.581 --> 01:42:05.373
Doesn't matter, we're almost there.
Just gotta get you to a safe jump altitude.

01:42:05.461 --> 01:42:07.537

You're cold because all the blood

You're going to be dead soon.

Don't listen to him, he's just scared.

01:42:54.385 --> 01:42:58.169

What if your chute fails?
Cancel the order.

Do it, man. You owe me that much.

01:43:55.612 --> 01:43:57.023
- OK, you ready?
- Yeah.

01:43:57.114 --> 01:43:57.814

One, two... three.

Easy. Come on, a little more.

01:44:03.245 --> 01:44:06.199
- Get your chute clear. OK?
- OK.

01:44:11.211 --> 01:44:14.497
I'll see you on the ground, all right?

01:44:14.923 --> 01:44:16.715
I'll see you in hell, Johnny.

01:44:20.220 --> 01:44:21.252
Oh!

I know it's hard for you. You want me

- Why don't you pull it?

01:45:49.560 --> 01:45:52.311
No games, Bodhi! Pull the cord now!

01:45:52.396 --> 01:45:54.768
Nah, you pull it.

01:45:55.024 --> 01:45:56.933
Go ahead, Johnny, pull it.

01:45:57.026 --> 01:45:58.568
You gotta drop the gun, right?

01:45:58.652 --> 01:46:01.439
If you use your other hand,
what you gonna hold on with?

01:46:01.530 --> 01:46:06.026
Pull it right now, or I blow
your fuckin' head off and pull it myself.

01:46:06.118 --> 01:46:09.783
- It's the only way it's gonna happen. Do it.
- Swear to God, I will.

01:46:09.872 --> 01:46:12.826
Do it, man, or you're gonna die, Johnny.

01:46:13.334 --> 01:46:15.907
Six seconds,
we're gonna be meat waffles.

01:46:16.003 --> 01:46:18.672
Five... four...

01:46:18.756 --> 01:46:22.421
- You're fuckin' crazy! PULL IT! PULL IT!
- ...three... two...

01:46:23.052 --> 01:46:24.297
- ...one...
- Shit!

01:46:24.887 --> 01:46:25.918
Shit!

01:46:35.981 --> 01:46:38.472
<i>(both shout)</i>

01:47:02.966 --> 01:47:03.998
<i>(coughs)</i>

01:47:10.974 --> 01:47:13.512
Jesus Christ, Bodhi.

01:47:15.604 --> 01:47:16.553
God.

01:47:16.647 --> 01:47:19.138
Damn, you are one radical son of a bitch.

01:47:40.963 --> 01:47:42.837
I'm outta here, Johnny.

01:47:44.049 --> 01:47:45.591
<i>(yells in pain)</i>

01:47:48.095 --> 01:47:49.969
<i>(screams)</i>

01:47:52.182 --> 01:47:54.424
That knee again, huh?

01:47:54.518 --> 01:47:57.852
Too bad. Looks like
this time you won't be getting your man.

01:48:00.691 --> 01:48:02.268
This game we both lose.

01:48:20.294 --> 01:48:21.408
Let her go.

01:48:24.214 --> 01:48:26.172
Let her go!

01:48:51.492 --> 01:48:52.986
Johnny, I...

01:48:53.077 --> 01:48:56.243
Shh. Some other time.

01:49:05.005 --> 01:49:07.330
Come on, we're out of here.

01:49:12.846 --> 01:49:14.341
Yo, Johnny!

01:49:17.101 --> 01:49:19.058
I'll see you in the next life!

01:49:25.401 --> 01:49:27.856
<i>(whoops)</i>

01:49:43.168 --> 01:49:45.042
I can't leave him. We gotta bury him.

01:49:45.129 --> 01:49:47.964
There's no time, man.

01:50:11.822 --> 01:50:15.820

I wanna get out of this wet. I'm freezing.

01:51:08.545 --> 01:51:09.375
Sorry, mate.

01:51:09.463 --> 01:51:10.874
Anybody been out there?

01:51:10.964 --> 01:51:13.456
No-one's been out and no-one's going out.

01:51:13.550 --> 01:51:17.465
You gotta be fucking crazy, man.
Death-on-a-stick out there, mate.

01:51:23.102 --> 01:51:25.178
Coming down, man.

<i>(surf thunders)</i>

01:52:04.935 --> 01:52:06.726
Lose something, bro?

01:52:08.897 --> 01:52:13.690
Special Agent Utah.
I knew I could count on you.

01:52:14.153 --> 01:52:16.774
I've been to every city in Mexico.

01:52:17.448 --> 01:52:22.110
Came across an unclaimed piece
of meat in Baja, turned out to be Rosie.

01:52:22.202 --> 01:52:25.536
Guess he picked
a knife fight with somebody better.

01:52:26.123 --> 01:52:31.366
Found a passport of yours in Sumatra,
missed you by about a week in Fiji.

01:52:32.880 --> 01:52:36.083
But I knew
you wouldn't miss a 50-year storm, Bodhi.

01:52:36.508 --> 01:52:37.837
Yeah.

01:52:43.682 --> 01:52:48.593
Too bad. You finally get your waves
and it's totally closed out.

01:52:48.687 --> 01:52:50.894
Just waiting for my set.

01:52:53.567 --> 01:52:55.856
You gotta go down.

01:52:56.153 --> 01:52:59.688
You crossed the line
and people trusted you and they died.

01:53:00.157 --> 01:53:02.648
Yeah, it went bad, went real bad.

01:53:04.620 --> 01:53:07.740
Life sure has a sick sense of humour,
doesn't it?

01:53:09.500 --> 01:53:13.497
- Still surfing?
- Every day.

01:53:16.882 --> 01:53:20.132
Come on, Bodhi. It's time to go.

01:53:20.928 --> 01:53:23.501
You know you gotta go back with me.

01:53:24.181 --> 01:53:26.719
<i>(laughs)</i>

01:53:27.851 --> 01:53:29.180
Sorry, my friend.

01:53:34.108 --> 01:53:35.139
Come on!

01:54:50.309 --> 01:54:53.014
SHIT! NO!

01:54:53.228 --> 01:54:54.260
NO!!

01:54:56.357 --> 01:54:58.230
I told them...

01:54:58.859 --> 01:55:00.733
...you'd go quietly.

01:55:01.111 --> 01:55:02.985
<i>(helicopter)</i>

01:55:06.283 --> 01:55:07.149
NO!

01:55:08.869 --> 01:55:11.158
You know
there's no way I can handle a cage, man.

01:55:11.538 --> 01:55:14.575
I don't care. You gotta go down.

01:55:14.958 --> 01:55:17.876
It's gotta be that way.

01:55:37.731 --> 01:55:39.938
OK, man. OK.

01:55:42.361 --> 01:55:43.820
I'm screwed.

01:55:44.154 --> 01:55:49.778
I'm gonna go to jail and I'll pay,
and Johnny Utah gets his guy. Right?

01:55:49.868 --> 01:55:52.822
Good for you. That's real good.

01:55:53.163 --> 01:55:55.619
You're gonna be a big hero now.

01:55:56.667 --> 01:55:59.621
But look at it, Johnny. Look at it!

01:55:59.920 --> 01:56:02.589
This is
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, man.

01:56:02.673 --> 01:56:07.880
Just let me go out there, let me get
one wave before you take me. One wave.

01:56:08.262 --> 01:56:10.504
Where am I gonna go, man?

01:56:10.889 --> 01:56:15.183
Cliffs on both side.
I'm not gonna paddle to New Zealand!

01:56:17.396 --> 01:56:20.812
My whole life
has been about this moment, Johnny.

01:56:22.067 --> 01:56:23.312
Come on, compadre.

01:56:27.197 --> 01:56:28.027
Come on.

01:56:36.957 --> 01:56:37.573
COME ON!

01:57:12.117 --> 01:57:14.110
Via con Dios!

01:57:28.050 --> 01:57:29.461
What the fuck, Utah?

01:57:29.551 --> 01:57:32.303
You let him go!

01:57:33.472 --> 01:57:35.132
No, I didn't.

01:57:46.527 --> 01:57:49.444
No way! The guy's nuts.

01:57:57.538 --> 01:57:59.863
We'll get him when he comes back in.

01:58:00.499 --> 01:58:02.575
He's not coming back.
