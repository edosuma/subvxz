00:17.684 --> 00:20.145
My bad luck didn't start
in an Egyptian tomb.

00:22.147 --> 00:24.190
It didn't start in a Maya temple either.

00:25.275 --> 00:27.152
It started at a child's birthday party.

00:28.903 --> 00:32.323
As always, everything started with Lucy.

00:33.366 --> 00:34.576
My sister.

00:35.535 --> 00:38.538
Who simply smiled
and got anything she wanted.

00:38.621 --> 00:39.456
Lucy's cake!

00:39.539 --> 00:42.417
But to even out
what genetics have robbed me of,

00:42.500 --> 00:44.919
I had a kind of Machiavellian plan.

00:45.003 --> 00:46.504
Make a wish, Lucy!

00:47.464 --> 00:48.465
No!

00:49.632 --> 00:50.967
I stole your wish.

00:51.634 --> 00:55.305
Well I'm going to steal
all of your wishes forever.

00:57.807 --> 01:01.686
And from that day forward
everything changed.

01:01.770 --> 01:02.687
Everything.

01:02.771 --> 01:04.439
-Hi, Lucy
-Hi, Sara!

01:04.522 --> 01:06.399
-Is that her sister?
-I think so.

01:06.483 --> 01:09.903
Ugh. She was so annoying,
I begged my parents to change schools.

01:10.487 --> 01:11.321
Bye, Lucy.

01:11.404 --> 01:12.238
Bye, bad karma.

01:13.114 --> 01:14.449
Hello, Aarón.

01:15.366 --> 01:17.202
And everything was perfect.

01:17.285 --> 01:18.203
By the way,

01:18.745 --> 01:19.746
I have a surprise.

01:20.330 --> 01:21.164
Really?

01:22.082 --> 01:23.625
-Really.
-You made it yourself?

01:23.708 --> 01:24.709
Yes.

01:24.793 --> 01:27.253
Finally, Lucy's curse had ended.

01:28.546 --> 01:30.173
Sara, you're my…

01:30.673 --> 01:33.176
Love knocking at my door.

01:33.927 --> 01:36.054
You're my best friend.

01:36.554 --> 01:37.388
Or not.

01:37.472 --> 01:40.308
My string of bad luck wasn't over yet.

02:00.245 --> 02:01.621
Answer, I'm sure it's--

02:01.704 --> 02:02.539
My sister.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.707
They moved to Monterrey.

02:04.791 --> 02:05.959
I didn't see him again.

02:06.042 --> 02:06.876
SUBSCRIBE

02:06.960 --> 02:09.712
Aarón. My first real love.

02:11.339 --> 02:15.093
He had his first hit
and beat sales records.

02:15.927 --> 02:16.803
ARTIST OF THE YEAR

02:16.886 --> 02:19.097
He became super famous
and traveled the world.

02:20.890 --> 02:23.518
-Sara? Hi!
-Hello?

02:23.601 --> 02:25.854
And Lucy also became super famous.

02:25.937 --> 02:28.731
Her beauty captivated the catwalks

02:28.815 --> 02:31.734
and today she's the preferred model
for some big brands.

02:32.777 --> 02:35.613
They're both super famous and I…

02:35.697 --> 02:36.531
I am here.

02:37.532 --> 02:38.491
In Mérida.

02:40.034 --> 02:43.163
With a marvelous store that brings in--

02:43.246 --> 02:44.789
One thousand five hundred pesos.

02:44.873 --> 02:46.583
With that, we can buy more shirts

02:46.666 --> 02:47.834
and print more bombas.

02:47.917 --> 02:48.960
Look.

02:49.043 --> 02:50.003
It's a bomba.

02:51.504 --> 02:54.007
No, not a bomb that goes--

02:54.090 --> 02:55.258
And your brand?

02:55.341 --> 02:57.719
Sacni. That's a fantasy.

02:57.802 --> 02:59.762
You've settled, Sarita.

02:59.846 --> 03:01.764
Settled? How, Sacni?

03:01.848 --> 03:04.809
I'm living a stable life,

03:04.893 --> 03:05.727
a peaceful life…

03:05.810 --> 03:08.188
-In a crumbling house.
-…to get rid of my bad karma.

03:09.480 --> 03:12.609
I'm going to steal
all of your wishes forever.

03:15.778 --> 03:16.654
Sara?

03:22.118 --> 03:23.369
Sara?

03:24.662 --> 03:25.496
Sara!

03:26.789 --> 03:29.584
Open up, it's Lucy! Sister!

03:29.667 --> 03:31.002
A NETFLIX FILM

03:31.502 --> 03:32.670
I can't open this.

03:35.089 --> 03:39.260
My sister. The perfect one.
Always interrupting.

03:40.678 --> 03:41.721
Here it is.

03:41.804 --> 03:43.765
It's a Himalayan aquamarine.

03:44.265 --> 03:46.059
It's for good luck.

03:46.684 --> 03:48.853
Of which you've shamelessly robbed me?

03:49.979 --> 03:51.481
How thoughtful, thank you.

03:51.564 --> 03:54.192
Sari, I need an update.
I want to know everything.

03:54.275 --> 03:56.486
How's it going with Gilberto?
How's the boutique?

03:56.569 --> 03:57.487
Roberto.

03:57.570 --> 03:58.571
Hello!

03:58.655 --> 04:01.241
-I'll get it.
-Hello, my daughters!

04:01.324 --> 04:04.327
-Mommy and Daddy are here!
-This is gorgeous, Mom.

04:04.410 --> 04:07.372
With the heat here, it will be so nice.

04:07.455 --> 04:08.414
Hey, Sarita.

04:08.498 --> 04:10.833
Have you done anything
about your grandma's house?

04:10.917 --> 04:14.254
Everything's falling apart.
You said you'd remodel it.

04:14.337 --> 04:16.506
Okay. Weren't you two separating?

04:16.589 --> 04:17.548
I'm getting married.

04:18.299 --> 04:19.425
-You?
-You, married?

04:19.509 --> 04:20.343
You're separating?

04:20.426 --> 04:22.053
-No.
-Your mom has a lover.

04:22.136 --> 04:24.806
-She wants an open relationship.
-What do you mean open?

04:24.889 --> 04:27.517
I don't have a lover!
It's the idea of a lover.

04:27.600 --> 04:28.643
It's an internet fling.

04:28.726 --> 04:30.895
Think of the STDs you could get.

04:30.979 --> 04:32.355
Okay, are you pregnant?

04:32.438 --> 04:35.316
-No. I'm in love.
-She's gonna meet him in Mérida.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.943
He's gonna wear a green shirt.

04:37.026 --> 04:38.069
Look. Why--

04:38.152 --> 04:41.155
Hey, Lucia. Who are you marrying?
A woman or man?

04:41.239 --> 04:42.198
Don't change the topic.

04:42.282 --> 04:45.702
Why not let
your older sister get married first?

04:45.785 --> 04:46.911
Enough!

04:48.746 --> 04:50.498
Why don't I show you all to your rooms

04:50.581 --> 04:52.959
and we'll talk about all this tomorrow?

04:53.584 --> 04:55.003
-Okay.
-Let's go.

04:57.672 --> 04:58.798
I don't want a divorce.

05:06.055 --> 05:08.891
Hey, Sari.
Thanks for lending me your room.

05:08.975 --> 05:11.602
Between the news
about Mom and Dad and the jet lag,

05:11.686 --> 05:13.521
I need to rest.

05:18.484 --> 05:19.694
Need extra sheets?

05:19.777 --> 05:21.112
No, dude. What sheets?

05:21.195 --> 05:23.740
I sleep naked here.
This heat is killing me.

05:26.409 --> 05:29.662
I'm getting married!

05:30.204 --> 05:31.039
How cool!

05:32.540 --> 05:33.666
Now you?

05:33.750 --> 05:34.959
What are you doing, Dad?

05:35.585 --> 05:36.753
Your mother.

05:37.378 --> 05:39.297
She doesn't want me to sleep with her.

05:39.380 --> 05:40.214
Seriously?

05:41.090 --> 05:42.050
For real, Mom?

05:43.051 --> 05:44.635
You kicked Dad out of the room?

05:44.719 --> 05:45.553
That sucks, Mom.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.431
It's just that your dad is angry.

05:49.015 --> 05:52.560
With all this open relationship stuff,
he's unbearable.

05:52.643 --> 05:54.771
Come on, you both need to get over it.

05:55.563 --> 05:57.190
-Your daughter's marrying.
-Yeah.

05:57.273 --> 05:58.399
That's more important.

05:58.483 --> 06:01.611
Yes. And with that beauty and charisma,
it's about time.

06:01.694 --> 06:03.529
Not as late as others, right?

06:06.657 --> 06:08.117
Good night, Ma. Sleep tight.

06:08.201 --> 06:09.911
Sleep tight, my love. Thank you.

06:12.538 --> 06:14.582
-Can't you hear me?
-Tell her congratulations.

06:14.665 --> 06:15.500
What?

06:17.001 --> 06:18.211
Fuck, there's a delay.

06:19.045 --> 06:20.588
But, can you hear me, my love?

06:20.671 --> 06:23.508
Yes, perfectly. I was just saying that…

06:23.591 --> 06:27.929
That…

06:28.012 --> 06:28.846
…your parents.

06:29.347 --> 06:30.223
My parents?

06:30.848 --> 06:31.682
Yeah.

06:32.934 --> 06:33.768
Well…

06:34.519 --> 06:35.353
I don't know.

06:35.436 --> 06:39.023
That naturally,
with her charisma and beauty,

06:39.107 --> 06:41.692
it was past time and blah, blah--

06:43.111 --> 06:44.195
Lame.

06:44.779 --> 06:45.822
What did you say…?

06:45.905 --> 06:50.535
What…?

06:59.460 --> 07:01.045
Hurry up!

07:01.129 --> 07:02.630
He'll be here soon.

07:19.230 --> 07:20.064
Hi.

07:20.982 --> 07:22.066
You're Lucy's sister?

07:23.109 --> 07:23.985
I'm her fiancé.

07:24.694 --> 07:25.528
How are you?

07:26.612 --> 07:28.114
-Aarón?
-Sara?

07:29.949 --> 07:30.950
Sara!

07:32.743 --> 07:34.245
Is it really you?

07:34.328 --> 07:35.413
For real?

07:36.330 --> 07:37.707
Sarita!

07:38.416 --> 07:39.834
-Sara!
-I can't believe it.

07:40.960 --> 07:41.919
Is this for real?

07:42.003 --> 07:44.297
That… that you… actually…

07:44.380 --> 07:45.256
Are you really…

07:45.339 --> 07:46.674
My fiancé!

07:47.383 --> 07:48.468
My baby!

07:48.551 --> 07:49.677
Baby!

07:49.760 --> 07:51.345
I'm so excited you're here!

07:52.763 --> 07:55.725
The curse is real.
She's gonna end up with everything I want.

07:55.808 --> 07:58.269
This is a very important moment for me.

07:58.352 --> 07:59.812
Truthfully. You have no idea…

08:00.354 --> 08:01.856
Hey, Sari. Thank you.

08:01.939 --> 08:03.399
Sari, Aarón.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.234
-Aarón, Sari.
-You won't believe it.

08:06.152 --> 08:08.821
I need you to be best friends.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.157
We already were best friends!

08:11.240 --> 08:13.159
-What?
-Sari, sardine!

08:14.035 --> 08:15.786
-Come, Sarita.
-You know each other?

08:15.870 --> 08:16.704
Is this a joke?

08:16.787 --> 08:17.914
Good morning!

08:19.207 --> 08:20.458
-General.
-For real?

08:20.541 --> 08:22.043
-Don't you remember me?
-Morning.

08:22.126 --> 08:24.295
-Isn't that your best friend from--
-Yes!

08:24.378 --> 08:25.463
High school!

08:25.546 --> 08:26.547
-Yes!
-You are correct.

08:26.631 --> 08:28.132
Weren't you that shitty kid?

08:28.216 --> 08:29.800
Yes, but now I'm the shit!

08:29.884 --> 08:31.552
Stay for breakfast?

08:31.636 --> 08:32.553
That's why I came.

08:32.637 --> 08:36.057
How about you take a bath
and fix up your hair. No?

08:36.140 --> 08:37.808
What are you drinking?

08:38.392 --> 08:39.894
I'm going to make a mimosa.

08:40.728 --> 08:43.022
-Of course.
-That's how I breakfast.

08:44.649 --> 08:46.984
Sari, sardine!

08:47.068 --> 08:49.612
Sari, sardine!

08:49.695 --> 08:51.280
Aren't you eating, Sara?

08:53.115 --> 08:53.991
Sara!

08:54.575 --> 08:55.785
-I'm okay!
-Are you okay?

08:55.868 --> 08:58.579
This is what happens
when you don't take care of your house.

08:58.663 --> 08:59.830
Where will you sleep?

08:59.914 --> 09:01.374
-Me?
-With me. Where else?

09:01.457 --> 09:02.375
In my room?

09:03.709 --> 09:06.212
Wait a minute. I'll be quick. Just wait.

09:06.295 --> 09:07.588
Holy Mother.

09:07.672 --> 09:08.923
Are you really not hurt?

09:09.006 --> 09:10.591
-You okay?
-I need to hang up…

09:10.675 --> 09:12.134
No. All good. I'm fine.

09:12.218 --> 09:13.636
Why are you so nervous?

09:13.719 --> 09:15.054
Can I help with something?

09:16.097 --> 09:18.391
I'm not nervous. Why would I be?

09:18.474 --> 09:19.433
It's the caffeine.

09:19.517 --> 09:21.978
-All good. It's normal.
-Sara.

09:22.061 --> 09:23.563
Breathe. Please.

09:24.814 --> 09:25.648
Look.

09:26.524 --> 09:29.026
I know bullying at school
had a bad effect on you.

09:29.110 --> 09:29.944
Okay, but…

09:31.445 --> 09:32.738
Was it him?

09:33.322 --> 09:35.449
Of course it was.
That's why you're like this?

09:35.533 --> 09:37.910
Lucy, please. Seriously, relax.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.412
And nothing's wrong.

09:39.495 --> 09:41.372
Stay as long as you like.

09:41.455 --> 09:42.498
Your home is my home.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.208
I mean, my home is your home.

09:44.292 --> 09:45.167
All good, okay?

09:47.503 --> 09:49.213
Know what? I need one thing.

09:49.922 --> 09:51.507
Don't pretend like you know me,

09:51.591 --> 09:52.967
because you don't.

09:57.930 --> 09:58.931
Hey, Sacni.

09:59.015 --> 10:00.349
About how long?

10:01.267 --> 10:04.020
How long would it take
to sell off everything in the store?

10:04.103 --> 10:05.813
Can I have breakfast?

10:05.896 --> 10:08.065
I'm just thinking about leaving the city.

10:08.149 --> 10:09.775
-Why?
-Circumstances outside my control.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.862
Or, better yet, I'll leave the country.

10:13.738 --> 10:15.573
-The planet.
-What crawled up your butt?

10:16.657 --> 10:18.075
What are you doing here, Sara?

10:18.159 --> 10:19.452
I'll call you back.

10:21.245 --> 10:23.247
So, this was your grandma's house,

10:23.331 --> 10:24.540
and now it's your store?

10:25.207 --> 10:26.292
Yes.

10:26.375 --> 10:27.918
Truth is, I'm great.

10:28.002 --> 10:29.086
You too, right?

10:29.170 --> 10:30.630
I heard something about you.

10:30.713 --> 10:32.423
Are you a model or what?

10:32.506 --> 10:33.466
Model?

10:34.050 --> 10:34.884
Singer.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.678
-Soloist.
-Singer, sure.

10:38.179 --> 10:39.930
Well, I'm a businesswoman.

10:40.014 --> 10:43.142
"While walking through the cemetery,
I heard a skull shout,

10:43.225 --> 10:46.103
'If you're not gonna give it up,
at least whip it out.'" Bomba!

10:47.146 --> 10:49.190
They're selling like hotcakes.

10:50.524 --> 10:53.069
I always knew
you'd do something avant-garde.

10:53.152 --> 10:55.279
Well look at you, all famous. That's cool.

10:55.363 --> 10:56.489
Not as famous as you.

10:56.572 --> 10:58.240
Look, here come your fans.

10:58.324 --> 10:59.158
We're closed!

11:00.159 --> 11:00.993
Later.

11:02.036 --> 11:03.871
-Don't you need to open?
-No.

11:04.914 --> 11:05.748
-Sure?
-Yes.

11:06.332 --> 11:07.917
Aarón. Aarón what? Star?

11:08.000 --> 11:08.959
Aarón Star.

11:09.043 --> 11:09.919
Can you read it?

11:11.253 --> 11:12.129
Yes.

11:14.256 --> 11:17.843
Great. I'll leave you to attend
to your legion of fans.

11:17.927 --> 11:20.388
-Perfect, brother-in-law.
-Open up your store and…

11:23.182 --> 11:24.392
And…

11:24.475 --> 11:26.560
-We'll talk later.
-Later, brother-in-law.

11:27.311 --> 11:28.312
Go.

11:28.396 --> 11:29.605
-All right. Bye.
-Bye.

11:30.564 --> 11:31.691
Yoo-hoo.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.235
Are you open?

11:36.696 --> 11:37.780
Look, Sarita!

11:37.863 --> 11:40.574
Yucatán Fashion Fest.

11:40.658 --> 11:41.659
Okay, so are we going?

11:42.618 --> 11:45.663
No. You know I've left
such trivialities behind.

11:45.746 --> 11:47.289
You haven't even tried.

11:49.125 --> 11:51.001
I also can't believe

11:51.711 --> 11:53.462
that you believe in curses.

11:53.546 --> 11:54.630
And from your sister!

11:55.339 --> 11:56.173
Why?

11:57.091 --> 11:58.676
-Is she a witch?
-No, dude!

11:58.759 --> 11:59.927
Worse.

12:00.010 --> 12:01.053
She's a model.

12:01.137 --> 12:02.638
…designer Colavita…

12:02.722 --> 12:03.639
Here you are.

12:03.723 --> 12:04.974
Thanks.

12:05.057 --> 12:06.267
Cheers.

12:06.851 --> 12:09.687
You know that when I drink
I go crazy, so, no.

12:10.688 --> 12:13.107
Let it go. That's what you need to do.

12:13.190 --> 12:14.650
Dream again!

12:14.734 --> 12:15.818
My God. Really…

12:16.444 --> 12:18.404
Another time, definitely, all right?

12:18.487 --> 12:20.990
Right now, I just want to be alone.

12:21.073 --> 12:21.949
Alone.

12:22.658 --> 12:25.077
You don't know how happy it makes me

12:25.161 --> 12:27.371
that you can finally meet my family.

12:27.455 --> 12:28.789
-Who's she talking to?
-Look.

12:28.873 --> 12:32.042
-Her fans.
-She has fans?

12:32.126 --> 12:33.586
-Cheers, Mom.
-Cheers.

12:33.669 --> 12:35.671
Here's my dad. Say hi, Dad.

12:36.213 --> 12:38.048
So handsome with those sunglasses!

12:38.132 --> 12:39.884
And I'd like you to meet Sari,

12:39.967 --> 12:41.218
my older sister.

12:41.302 --> 12:45.723
Allow me to tell you
that she's the coolest designer there is.

12:45.806 --> 12:47.141
She's also my best friend.

12:47.224 --> 12:49.727
Since we were little,
people have said we're identical.

12:49.810 --> 12:50.853
What do you think?

12:50.936 --> 12:52.438
They got it from me.

12:52.521 --> 12:53.355
Yep.

12:53.981 --> 12:55.191
They're saying I'm ugly.

12:56.692 --> 12:57.526
Okay.

12:58.402 --> 13:00.196
The time has come.

13:00.279 --> 13:01.280
I'm very nervous.

13:01.363 --> 13:02.364
Okay.

13:02.448 --> 13:04.408
I'd like to share with you

13:04.492 --> 13:06.952
the reason I've decided
to gather with my family,

13:07.036 --> 13:09.079
including you, of course,

13:09.163 --> 13:11.665
in Mérida, my grandmother's homeland.

13:11.749 --> 13:12.958
May she rest in peace.

13:13.042 --> 13:14.376
Rest in peace.

13:14.460 --> 13:15.503
Baby.

13:15.586 --> 13:17.338
-Do you want to say or should I?
-You.

13:17.421 --> 13:19.048
-Are you sure?
-Yes, my love.

13:19.131 --> 13:20.883
I feel like I can't breathe.

13:20.966 --> 13:22.468
Okay. Here goes.

13:23.844 --> 13:25.471
My baby and I…

13:25.971 --> 13:27.556
got married!

13:28.808 --> 13:30.392
What? They're already married?

13:32.853 --> 13:33.687
Congratulations!

13:35.189 --> 13:36.482
Congratulations!

13:38.359 --> 13:39.193
Aarón!

13:39.902 --> 13:41.028
Aarón Star!

13:41.111 --> 13:42.446
Why are you hiding here?

13:43.489 --> 13:44.406
Do you agree

13:44.490 --> 13:47.910
that Aarón Star is officially
the worst artist name in the universe?

13:47.993 --> 13:49.495
My manager gave it to me.

13:49.578 --> 13:51.080
Who is your manager? Your mom?

13:52.039 --> 13:53.415
What the hell?

13:53.499 --> 13:54.583
And who are they?

13:55.125 --> 13:56.627
Some reggaeton dudes, I think.

13:57.461 --> 13:59.129
I like the Punk Flamingos more.

14:00.714 --> 14:01.549
Me too.

14:02.716 --> 14:03.592
Thank you!

14:04.218 --> 14:05.970
We're the Punk Flamingos!

14:06.470 --> 14:08.055
This is all thanks to you.

14:10.891 --> 14:11.976
Okay.

14:12.059 --> 14:12.893
Shall we?

14:13.394 --> 14:14.603
-Let's go.
-But that way.

14:15.145 --> 14:16.146
-Okay.
-Okay?

14:16.647 --> 14:17.690
You go that way.

14:17.773 --> 14:19.441
No, I'm saying you leave…

14:19.525 --> 14:21.318
Cover your face!

14:30.786 --> 14:31.996
You make Aarón laugh.

14:33.497 --> 14:34.498
-Me?
-Yes.

14:35.499 --> 14:37.918
I saw you running
out of the restaurant together…

14:39.253 --> 14:40.504
How'd you make him laugh?

14:42.631 --> 14:46.760
Well, you know better than anyone
how to make your fiancé laugh, right?

14:48.470 --> 14:50.890
No, it's just that I've known him…

14:54.143 --> 14:55.311
for three weeks.

14:56.896 --> 14:57.855
Excuse me?

14:57.938 --> 15:00.274
Well, we were a couple for several months.

15:00.357 --> 15:02.818
But he was in Spain, and I was in Nepal.

15:03.736 --> 15:06.697
So, like this, face-to-face, yeah,

15:06.780 --> 15:08.073
three weeks,

15:09.199 --> 15:10.200
and two days.

15:12.661 --> 15:14.914
This is your chance to end this farce.

15:17.291 --> 15:19.043
If you don't do it for your sister,

15:19.126 --> 15:20.961
do it for yourself, you bad bitch.

15:21.045 --> 15:22.296
And for Aarón Star.

15:23.464 --> 15:25.049
That would be envy, Sacni.

15:25.132 --> 15:27.134
Betrayal. And I'm not like that.

15:27.718 --> 15:29.261
I'd go straight to hell.

15:30.679 --> 15:32.014
So now you're Christian.

15:32.890 --> 15:36.435
If the priest could see you
on your virtual dates with your boyfriend.

15:37.603 --> 15:38.687
Tell me!

15:38.771 --> 15:39.855
See how wet I am?

15:39.939 --> 15:40.898
Yes!

15:40.981 --> 15:41.899
Tell me…

15:41.982 --> 15:44.693
-"Do you like me wet?"
-Shut up!

15:45.945 --> 15:47.571
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

15:48.906 --> 15:51.075
What's wrong with you?
How do you know that?

15:51.575 --> 15:53.243
Besides, you said it yourself.

15:53.327 --> 15:54.578
I have a boyfriend.

15:54.662 --> 15:57.289
But how long has it been
since you've seen him in person?

15:58.040 --> 15:58.874
Ay, Sarita.

16:00.209 --> 16:01.794
I know you love him a lot,

16:01.877 --> 16:03.837
but virtual love isn't real.

16:08.968 --> 16:12.429
Baby, this is my specialty.
It's to die for. Try it.

16:12.513 --> 16:13.347
What is it?

16:13.430 --> 16:14.264
A dip.

16:15.140 --> 16:17.935
No, wait. Aren't you allergic to shrimp?

16:18.018 --> 16:19.853
-What?
-Yes. It has shrimp?

16:19.937 --> 16:22.022
Careful, you'll kill him
before the wedding.

16:22.106 --> 16:23.607
I didn't know you're allergic.

16:24.191 --> 16:25.526
Haven't you seen my shrimp?

16:25.609 --> 16:26.568
Hey!

16:26.652 --> 16:28.404
I have it tattooed right here.

16:28.487 --> 16:30.990
-How vulgar!
-It's to show that I'm allergic.

16:31.657 --> 16:35.536
It's just like the decorations
that Sara would make when she was little.

16:35.619 --> 16:37.830
She drew for me every day in high school.

16:37.913 --> 16:38.789
With a pen.

16:38.872 --> 16:40.541
Do you remember them always playing?

16:40.624 --> 16:43.043
They rolled around on fabric
to decorate them.

16:43.127 --> 16:45.004
What do you mean they rolled around?

16:45.087 --> 16:47.798
-You don't remember. You were little.
-We'd just lay there.

16:47.881 --> 16:49.591
Sara, what's up?

16:49.675 --> 16:50.843
-This is your hand.
-Yes.

16:50.926 --> 16:53.554
No. Listen, for real.
This is a work of art.

16:53.637 --> 16:54.513
You're a genius.

16:54.596 --> 16:55.723
What was that technique?

16:55.806 --> 16:57.725
Cyanotype. They develop in the sun.

16:57.808 --> 17:00.269
I can't believe you kept
all this from high school.

17:02.104 --> 17:03.105
I have an idea.

17:03.188 --> 17:04.189
This is great.

17:04.273 --> 17:05.649
Oh no, please, no.

17:05.733 --> 17:08.527
I have a super idea.

17:09.403 --> 17:11.488
Amore mio!

17:12.614 --> 17:15.659
Come to my arms, please!

17:15.743 --> 17:17.286
I can't believe it!

17:17.369 --> 17:19.163
Look at him.

17:24.001 --> 17:24.918
Sari,

17:25.002 --> 17:26.920
I'd like to introduce you to Colavita.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.048
Arturo Colavita?

17:29.965 --> 17:31.633
But he's super famous.

17:34.011 --> 17:36.180
Wow, what an honor! Such a pleasure.

17:36.263 --> 17:37.973
I don't touch people, girl.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.267
-Oh, okay.
-Bring some towels, please.

17:40.350 --> 17:41.685
Have a seat, please.

17:41.769 --> 17:44.313
Baby, tell me, please.

17:45.064 --> 17:47.191
Do you have a collection for Fashion Fest?

17:47.274 --> 17:48.525
I did.

17:48.609 --> 17:51.862
But I visited
that bitch Marina Abramóvich,

17:51.945 --> 17:53.072
in Sarajevo.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.450
And now I have doubts.

17:57.117 --> 17:59.495
I don't know, she stole my inspiration.

17:59.578 --> 18:01.371
-She stole it?
-Come on, inspire me.

18:01.955 --> 18:04.291
I understand perfectly.
I'm quite familiar.

18:04.374 --> 18:05.501
Well, prepare yourself,

18:05.584 --> 18:09.338
because I'm about to introduce you
to the person that will save your life.

18:09.421 --> 18:11.215
No, it's all already finished.

18:11.298 --> 18:12.883
I'm not presenting just any shawl.

18:13.634 --> 18:16.386
-Ta-da!
-Lucy.

18:16.470 --> 18:17.638
What are you doing?

18:17.721 --> 18:18.889
-Local design?
-No.

18:19.473 --> 18:20.724
Cenotype.

18:20.808 --> 18:21.642
Ah!

18:21.725 --> 18:22.935
Cyanotype.

18:23.018 --> 18:25.187
Whatever it's called.
It's made with the sun.

18:25.270 --> 18:26.939
-Wow!
-What about this?

18:27.898 --> 18:29.650
It has something.

18:30.317 --> 18:33.362
But it needs to be finer fabrics,
this is shit.

18:33.445 --> 18:34.863
-Hey, no.
-Is this polyester?

18:34.947 --> 18:36.615
-Don't be a bitch.
-They're old.

18:36.698 --> 18:38.033
-Ah.
-Don't be a bitch.

18:38.117 --> 18:42.371
She just happens to be the very designer

18:42.454 --> 18:43.872
who will make my bridal gown.

18:44.456 --> 18:45.582
-What?
-Yes?

18:45.666 --> 18:47.793
-What are you talking about?
-Wow!

18:47.876 --> 18:50.712
No, you don't understand
what my wedding to Aarón will be.

18:50.796 --> 18:53.090
It's huge, my love.
And it's gone out of control.

18:53.173 --> 18:55.384
Everyone is talking about her,
it's madness.

18:55.467 --> 18:56.718
And you, my love…

18:56.802 --> 18:57.636
listen well.

18:57.719 --> 19:00.222
-You need her in your show.
-Lucy--

19:01.640 --> 19:02.474
Really, no…

19:04.017 --> 19:04.852
Need?

19:04.935 --> 19:06.770
-Totally.
-Of course not!

19:06.854 --> 19:09.523
I don't know what you're up to,
but no way. Not happening.

19:09.606 --> 19:10.899
-Sari…
-No. Never!

19:10.983 --> 19:14.194
Relax. Hey, Sara Escribano!
Where are you going?

19:14.278 --> 19:15.112
She's your sister?

19:15.195 --> 19:16.029
Yes!

19:16.113 --> 19:17.990
-I love that attitude!
-I love her!

19:18.073 --> 19:19.116
She's the coolest.

19:19.199 --> 19:21.785
I need her for Fashion Fest.

19:21.869 --> 19:24.496
"EL REY" MINI MARKET

19:24.580 --> 19:26.623
Without end
With you until morning comes

19:27.541 --> 19:30.586
And the electronic part will start there.

19:30.669 --> 19:34.173
I mean, the bolero-electronica
combination part.

19:34.256 --> 19:37.217
It feels mellow.
I don't know if the label will like that.

19:37.301 --> 19:40.345
I don't know if the label will like it,
but I want to do it.

19:40.846 --> 19:44.099
It will be a surprise.
They won't even notice.

19:44.183 --> 19:45.142
Let's record.

19:45.225 --> 19:46.059
Okay.

19:46.894 --> 19:47.853
Okay, then. Record.

19:49.897 --> 19:54.318
I know what I've always wanted to be

19:54.401 --> 19:57.154
Yeah, all I want to do

19:57.237 --> 20:00.073
Is dance without end

20:00.657 --> 20:03.285
With you until morning comes

20:04.161 --> 20:06.663
What I've always wanted to be

20:07.206 --> 20:09.875
All I want to do

20:09.958 --> 20:12.920
Is dance without end

20:13.420 --> 20:15.214
With you until morning comes

20:15.297 --> 20:18.383
And where have we hidden

20:18.467 --> 20:21.595
All of those dreams we had as children?

20:21.678 --> 20:23.055
They never took off

20:23.138 --> 20:25.807
They never left the nest

20:28.060 --> 20:31.897
I know what I've always wanted to be

20:32.606 --> 20:35.067
Yeah, all I want to do

20:35.150 --> 20:38.320
Is dance without end

20:38.946 --> 20:41.531
With you until morning comes

20:46.912 --> 20:49.331
-Margarita, double, please.
-Yeah.

20:53.043 --> 20:54.753
I have to get out of this country.

20:56.880 --> 20:59.258
I need to go very far away.

20:59.341 --> 21:00.217
To Europe?

21:01.093 --> 21:03.303
No! Europe? Farther.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.098
I don't know. Australia.

21:06.974 --> 21:07.808
Vietnam.

21:08.850 --> 21:09.893
The Philippines.

21:09.977 --> 21:10.811
There we go.

21:10.894 --> 21:11.895
-Here.
-Philippines.

21:11.979 --> 21:14.815
What you need is a bandera shot.

21:15.440 --> 21:16.733
A Margarita? Really?

21:16.817 --> 21:18.026
That's so white.

21:19.111 --> 21:20.070
So spring break.

21:20.988 --> 21:21.989
A bandera.

21:22.572 --> 21:24.908
Tequila, lime, sangrita.

21:25.409 --> 21:26.243
Yes.

21:26.326 --> 21:28.203
I'm not doing a bandera.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.080
What? Make it two.

21:30.163 --> 21:31.123
Give us two.

21:31.206 --> 21:33.083
Like old times, no?

21:33.166 --> 21:35.669
High school is already old times.

21:36.336 --> 21:37.421
Shit. Ancient times.

21:38.755 --> 21:40.465
Are you following me or what?

21:40.549 --> 21:41.591
Yes. I mean, no.

21:41.675 --> 21:43.302
It's just…

21:43.385 --> 21:44.219
What about you?

21:44.720 --> 21:45.971
Are you avoiding me?

21:48.015 --> 21:49.474
-Me?
-Don't play dumb.

21:49.558 --> 21:51.852
Why won't you talk to me like before?

21:52.394 --> 21:53.687
Because this isn't before.

21:55.439 --> 21:57.649
Plus, where is Lucy?

21:59.901 --> 22:00.736
Thank you.

22:02.404 --> 22:03.989
You are…

22:04.823 --> 22:05.699
Yes.

22:05.782 --> 22:06.908
At your service.

22:10.495 --> 22:11.913
Let's go!

22:11.997 --> 22:13.623
-Do you know it?
-Totally.

22:14.666 --> 22:15.542
See?

22:15.625 --> 22:17.627
I'm gonna chew you up, girl

22:17.711 --> 22:19.171
"I'm gonna chew you up, girl"?

22:20.881 --> 22:21.840
Okay.

22:21.923 --> 22:23.383
Wait, this is the best part.

22:24.885 --> 22:25.802
You're my bubblegum

22:26.386 --> 22:29.431
You're my cinnamon gum

22:30.766 --> 22:33.894
You're spicy, but delicious

22:35.145 --> 22:38.857
You're my cinnamon gum, baby

22:39.483 --> 22:42.569
I won't stop
Until my tongue goes numb

22:43.195 --> 22:44.196
This guy knows it.

22:44.988 --> 22:45.822
Cheers.

22:45.906 --> 22:47.908
No, really, it's pure poetry.

22:47.991 --> 22:50.202
-Pure poetry. Very modern art.
-Very…

22:50.285 --> 22:52.954
-New generation.
-Yes, very artistic.

22:53.038 --> 22:54.873
Yes, it deserves a shot.

22:55.457 --> 22:56.375
Great creativity.

22:57.834 --> 22:58.877
Look what I can do.

23:01.463 --> 23:04.216
You're my cinnamon gum

23:05.717 --> 23:08.762
You're spicy, but delicious

23:10.097 --> 23:13.850
You're my cinnamon gum, baby

23:14.684 --> 23:15.519
What?

23:19.606 --> 23:20.524
I want you.

23:22.526 --> 23:23.693
What?

23:23.777 --> 23:27.239
I want you to be so happy with my sister.

23:28.448 --> 23:30.117
No, wait.

23:30.700 --> 23:33.537
I mean, I want you to be unhappy.

23:34.162 --> 23:35.539
-What?
-That's a word, right?

23:35.622 --> 23:38.834
Unhappy?
Why would you want me to be unhappy?

23:38.917 --> 23:40.252
What are you saying?

23:40.335 --> 23:41.420
No! Look. Wait.

23:41.503 --> 23:43.839
It's not that I want you to be unhappy.

23:43.922 --> 23:45.424
It's that I can't want anything.

23:45.507 --> 23:47.300
What are you talking about, Sara?

23:47.801 --> 23:50.762
Since I was little,
I haven't been allowed to want,

23:50.846 --> 23:52.431
because when I want something,

23:52.514 --> 23:53.849
it happens for someone else,

23:53.932 --> 23:56.268
and, well, bad things happen to me.

23:57.018 --> 24:00.313
So, that's why I want you
to be super unhappy.

24:00.397 --> 24:02.149
So the opposite happens.

24:02.691 --> 24:04.401
That's why you won't do Fashion Fest?

24:05.318 --> 24:06.153
Correct.

24:07.571 --> 24:10.157
But this is serious.
I mean, it's powerful. It's serious.

24:11.116 --> 24:12.242
Where are you going?

24:13.076 --> 24:15.454
We're chilling, drinking. Come back.

24:16.288 --> 24:17.414
Who are you calling?

24:17.956 --> 24:18.790
Colavita.

24:18.874 --> 24:19.833
No! What the hell?

24:20.333 --> 24:21.918
-No!
-Yes, ma'am.

24:22.002 --> 24:23.962
I forbid you from dialing those numbers!

24:24.463 --> 24:25.922
Dial this.

24:26.006 --> 24:26.840
Hey!

24:26.923 --> 24:29.050
Hey, Colavita. You design, I'll sing.

24:29.134 --> 24:31.094
What you're doing is very serious!

24:31.636 --> 24:32.471
"Very serious."

24:32.554 --> 24:33.763
For real!

24:33.847 --> 24:36.725
Sara, what you've just said
is one of the stupidest things

24:36.808 --> 24:39.144
I've heard in my fucking life.

24:39.227 --> 24:40.854
Horrible things will happen.

24:40.937 --> 24:42.856
-Nothing bad will happen.
-I'm serious.

24:42.939 --> 24:44.691
I'm serious. Bad things will happen.

24:44.774 --> 24:45.984
Please. I'm going to cry.

24:46.067 --> 24:46.902
Say yes.

24:47.527 --> 24:50.572
-We'll do it together.
-Okay.

24:54.826 --> 24:55.911
-Yes?
-No.

24:55.994 --> 24:58.163
-It'll be so cool.
-Okay, fine.

24:58.788 --> 25:00.665
-Let's go.
-Fashion Fest, here we go!

25:02.417 --> 25:04.002
That sucks!

25:05.295 --> 25:06.546
I'm hungry!

25:13.011 --> 25:14.596
-Remember the hot dogs?
-Cheers.

25:15.430 --> 25:16.806
Yes, the hot dogs from school.

25:16.890 --> 25:17.807
Yes.

25:19.267 --> 25:20.602
We called them Ms. Hair's.

25:22.187 --> 25:24.397
'Cause they always
had little hairs in them.

25:27.526 --> 25:28.777
Great song!

25:29.528 --> 25:30.695
Great song!

25:31.488 --> 25:33.615
Sari, things will
go differently this time.

25:37.661 --> 25:38.620
Look, seriously,

25:39.496 --> 25:42.666
this song brings back bad memories.

25:43.583 --> 25:45.919
Bad? Why bad?

25:46.002 --> 25:47.128
Because it does.

25:47.212 --> 25:48.129
"Because it does."

25:49.673 --> 25:51.424
Time passed by

25:51.508 --> 25:52.342
No.

25:53.051 --> 25:56.012
Like a shooting star

25:56.096 --> 25:56.930
No.

25:57.013 --> 25:59.391
And our love passed away

25:59.474 --> 26:03.144
For no reason, baby

26:03.228 --> 26:04.062
Don't go.

26:04.145 --> 26:06.273
I'd like to go back

26:06.356 --> 26:09.401
To that time once again

26:09.985 --> 26:12.237
No, no way.

26:12.737 --> 26:16.700
But I can't

26:16.783 --> 26:18.535
Without your love

26:19.661 --> 26:23.290
I don't know what to do with myself

26:23.373 --> 26:24.874
Without your love

26:26.626 --> 26:27.961
I don't know my destiny

26:28.044 --> 26:29.087
Come on, sing.

26:29.588 --> 26:31.131
Without your love

26:32.716 --> 26:39.681
The world falls all around me

26:40.557 --> 26:41.391
Baby

26:41.474 --> 26:43.143
I'd like to love you again
Want you again

26:43.226 --> 26:45.270
To have you near me again, girl

26:45.353 --> 26:46.688
My eyes cry for you

26:46.771 --> 26:48.481
I'd like to love you again
Want you again

26:48.565 --> 26:50.859
To have you near me again, girl

26:50.942 --> 26:52.527
My eyes cry for you

26:52.611 --> 26:55.363
I miss you so much
I can't deny it

26:55.447 --> 26:57.824
I don't know how
You could walk out of my life

26:57.907 --> 27:00.952
You tore up my heart
Like a piece of paper

27:01.036 --> 27:03.538
You played with my life
And now I ask myself, why?

27:03.622 --> 27:06.416
Why did I have to fall in love with you?

27:06.499 --> 27:08.793
To love you like I did and to lose you?

27:08.877 --> 27:11.713
I don't believe it's fair
In the eyes of God

27:11.796 --> 27:14.549
I gave you so much love
And you paid me back with pain

27:14.633 --> 27:17.385
But someday you'll realize
What I felt for you

27:17.469 --> 27:20.430
And you'll think of me
Even when I'm far away

27:20.513 --> 27:23.391
Now all I have left are memories

27:23.475 --> 27:26.186
And in my heart
A voice that says, "I love you"

27:26.269 --> 27:27.812
Without your love

27:29.022 --> 27:31.816
I don't know what to do with myself

27:31.900 --> 27:33.193
Without your love

27:34.569 --> 27:36.863
-I don't know my destiny
-Without your love…

27:36.946 --> 27:37.906
Did you accept?

27:39.199 --> 27:40.283
I accepted!

27:40.367 --> 27:41.785
-Yeah!
-She accepted.

27:41.868 --> 27:43.870
Baby, you did it!

27:43.953 --> 27:44.996
Surprise!

27:45.538 --> 27:46.623
Surprise!

27:47.207 --> 27:48.375
It's her boyfriend.

27:48.458 --> 27:49.334
Why are you here?

27:49.417 --> 27:50.627
-What boyfriend?
-Hers.

27:50.710 --> 27:52.921
He came to surprise her.
Isn't that so lovely.

27:53.004 --> 27:53.838
Hello!

28:05.725 --> 28:06.559
Oh!

28:07.143 --> 28:07.977
Lucy…

28:08.645 --> 28:10.980
The fuck is up
with the bags under your eyes?

28:11.815 --> 28:15.193
Look, Lucy. Believe me, right now,

28:15.276 --> 28:19.322
the bags under my eyes
are the least of my problems.

28:22.075 --> 28:22.992
I know you care.

28:23.076 --> 28:25.286
Plus, your boyfriend is wandering around.

28:26.287 --> 28:27.706
-Roberto?
-Yeah.

28:28.498 --> 28:29.624
-He's here? Right?
-Yes.

28:30.417 --> 28:32.043
-Where'd he sleep?
-It's all good.

28:32.127 --> 28:33.628
-Where is he?
-Relax.

28:33.712 --> 28:34.546
Relax.

28:35.380 --> 28:38.633
-I'll make you pretty.
-No, wait.

28:40.343 --> 28:41.928
Water.

28:42.512 --> 28:43.346
Ta-da!

28:44.431 --> 28:45.640
I love you. Thanks.

28:47.684 --> 28:48.601
What the heck?

28:49.811 --> 28:52.063
You're just like Grandma.

28:52.147 --> 28:54.941
She told me Mérida
made her an alcoholic from the heat.

28:55.567 --> 28:56.651
What's your excuse?

28:56.735 --> 28:58.611
-No, Lucy. Not now.
-No. Come here.

28:58.695 --> 29:00.947
If you look in a mirror right now,
you'll cry.

29:01.030 --> 29:02.574
-Leave me alone!
-Come here!

29:03.158 --> 29:05.118
Your own inspiration, right?

29:05.201 --> 29:07.412
Yes. And this lettuce is from your farm?

29:07.495 --> 29:09.372
Dad, you're cooking? It's a miracle.

29:09.456 --> 29:11.249
-Good morning.
-Hey, Ma. What's up?

29:11.332 --> 29:13.710
-You look like the Phantom of the Opera.
-Scary.

29:14.461 --> 29:16.755
-Let's see how they came out.
-Delicious!

29:16.838 --> 29:17.672
Good morning.

29:18.673 --> 29:21.468
-Hello.
-Have a seat. Join us.

29:21.551 --> 29:22.677
Um…

29:22.761 --> 29:24.971
It's just, Aarón Star, that was my seat.

29:25.054 --> 29:25.889
Excuse me!

29:25.972 --> 29:28.433
No rush, I was just saying. It was a joke.

29:28.516 --> 29:30.143
-No, please.
-No, I'm going.

29:30.226 --> 29:31.686
No, really.

29:31.770 --> 29:32.604
Have you got it?

29:32.687 --> 29:33.897
-I'll sit here.
-No, me.

29:33.980 --> 29:35.482
You move your feet…

29:35.565 --> 29:36.399
Careful.

29:36.483 --> 29:38.359
Slowly. The wicker is super fragile.

29:38.443 --> 29:39.944
I'll sit very carefully.

29:40.028 --> 29:42.614
-Dad, don't exaggerate.
-Your coffee, Bobby.

29:43.198 --> 29:44.199
Thanks so much.

29:44.741 --> 29:47.076
Well, Bobby,
we have something to tell you.

29:47.160 --> 29:48.953
-What?
-We're married.

29:49.037 --> 29:50.872
How cool! Congratulations! When?

29:50.955 --> 29:53.041
-No.
-I mean, we're going to.

29:53.124 --> 29:53.958
It will be here.

29:54.459 --> 29:55.335
-Here?
-Yes.

29:55.418 --> 29:57.128
The dining room? You need more chairs.

29:57.837 --> 30:01.299
No. In Mérida, at a wonderful estate.
It's just dreamy. You have no idea.

30:01.382 --> 30:03.384
Guess who's making my dress?

30:03.468 --> 30:04.761
Um…

30:05.345 --> 30:06.805
-Who?
-Guess!

30:08.139 --> 30:11.059
-Mitsy.
-No. Sara Escribano.

30:11.142 --> 30:13.770
Even better! Congratulations! So cool!

30:13.853 --> 30:14.687
Wow!

30:14.771 --> 30:16.064
Marriage is terrible.

30:16.689 --> 30:17.649
What's up with you?

30:17.732 --> 30:18.608
Seriously, Dad?

30:19.275 --> 30:20.610
Mom, please do something.

30:20.693 --> 30:22.403
You'll never get married, right?

30:23.238 --> 30:24.823
Promise you'll never get married.

30:24.906 --> 30:26.282
Give me your word, Roberto.

30:30.119 --> 30:30.954
Sacni.

30:31.037 --> 30:32.455
Good morning, Sara Escribano.

30:32.539 --> 30:34.749
We need to hurry
to make my sister's dress,

30:34.833 --> 30:38.336
two hundred million accessories,
and a collection for Fashion Fest.

30:39.212 --> 30:40.088
You accepted?

30:44.843 --> 30:45.844
Yes!

30:47.095 --> 30:48.429
We're going to get it all.

30:52.684 --> 30:53.977
Did you ask for an advance?

30:57.021 --> 30:57.981
Fuck.

31:15.290 --> 31:16.624
Hello, what are you doing?

31:17.584 --> 31:18.668
Well I never.

31:42.817 --> 31:45.987
All I want to do is dance

31:46.070 --> 31:47.155
Aarón?

31:47.238 --> 31:48.323
Forever

31:48.948 --> 31:49.949
Is that a serenade?

31:50.033 --> 31:51.951
With you until morning comes

31:57.040 --> 31:58.416
They never took off

31:58.499 --> 32:01.294
They never left the nest

32:02.629 --> 32:03.755
Hey!

32:04.339 --> 32:05.173
What's up?

32:05.798 --> 32:06.633
What's up?

32:07.675 --> 32:08.676
Too loud?

32:09.260 --> 32:10.511
Yeah, I'm going to sleep.

32:11.429 --> 32:12.263
Okay.

32:12.347 --> 32:13.181
Okay.

32:14.724 --> 32:17.143
You're sleeping
on the first floor tonight, okay?

32:17.226 --> 32:18.394
-Okay.
-Okay.

32:19.896 --> 32:23.399
Just, make sure to close up the back room.

32:23.483 --> 32:25.568
-Yeah, okay.
-Where you guys sleep.

32:26.069 --> 32:28.071
-Okay.
-But seriously, close it up well.

32:29.072 --> 32:29.906
Okay.

32:31.616 --> 32:32.617
Good night, Sari.

32:32.700 --> 32:33.534
Sleep tight.

32:34.118 --> 32:35.578
-Bye. You too.
-See you tomorrow.

32:36.871 --> 32:38.331
-Okay.
-Okay, from there.

32:38.414 --> 32:41.250
I want to go out that evening
And make a miracle happen

32:41.334 --> 32:44.796
I want to pluck a star from the sky
To light my cigarette with

32:44.879 --> 32:46.130
Turn the world in my hand

32:46.214 --> 32:48.257
Like it were a basketball

32:48.341 --> 32:51.803
I want to keep your smile in my mind
Like when you had braces

32:53.721 --> 32:56.224
Baby, wait, I never wore braces.

32:58.101 --> 33:00.603
It's a metaphor.

33:01.854 --> 33:03.356
Because your smile

33:03.439 --> 33:04.399
is perfect…

33:11.614 --> 33:12.573
Can we talk now?

33:28.715 --> 33:30.091
Sorry.

33:30.174 --> 33:31.884
-Did I scratch you?
-What?

33:32.427 --> 33:33.970
I mean, yeah, but why?

33:34.053 --> 33:35.471
I wanted to give you a kiss.

33:35.972 --> 33:37.598
-Ah.
-Sorry.

33:37.682 --> 33:38.683
No, it's fine.

33:39.767 --> 33:41.436
Maybe you could be the big spoon?

33:42.270 --> 33:43.688
-No, not right now.
-No, yes.

33:43.771 --> 33:45.440
-No, wait.
-No, yes.

33:45.523 --> 33:46.357
No.

33:48.818 --> 33:49.986
Are you okay?

33:51.320 --> 33:53.573
What do we need to talk about now?

33:53.656 --> 33:55.658
About the same thing
we tried to talk about.

33:55.742 --> 33:57.201
-I don't want to.
-Smells great.

33:57.285 --> 33:58.661
-Coffee?
-How are you?

33:58.745 --> 34:00.246
-Hi, Dad.
-Want some eggs?

34:00.329 --> 34:03.082
-Good morning. Coffee?
-Yes, Ma. Please. With cream.

34:03.166 --> 34:05.501
-Eggs, too, right?
-Yes, with no onion.

34:05.585 --> 34:07.170
No, like this it has a ton--

34:07.253 --> 34:09.213
No onion is better. Just look.

34:09.297 --> 34:10.214
Hey, and Lucy?

34:10.298 --> 34:12.008
She stayed at a hotel.

34:12.091 --> 34:13.551
She didn't want to wake you.

34:14.177 --> 34:16.095
-What? She didn't sleep here?
-Look…

34:16.179 --> 34:18.890
-No. Did you say sugar?
-She didn't sleep in the shop?

34:19.640 --> 34:20.475
No.

34:21.309 --> 34:22.977
-What?
-What happened?

34:23.061 --> 34:23.895
Oh no.

34:24.562 --> 34:25.813
Oh no. They were exposed.

34:26.355 --> 34:27.273
They were exposed.

34:27.815 --> 34:30.026
I couldn't rinse them
and they were all exposed.

34:30.526 --> 34:31.569
No, no way.

34:32.195 --> 34:33.029
Oh no.

34:33.696 --> 34:34.655
Oh no.

34:34.739 --> 34:36.449
-What's up?
-What happened?

34:36.532 --> 34:38.201
What's going on, Sara? Dear God!

34:38.284 --> 34:39.118
What happened?

34:39.202 --> 34:41.079
You should have stayed here

34:41.162 --> 34:44.457
and closed up like I had asked you to.
It was very simple.

34:44.540 --> 34:46.125
They were very easy instructions.

34:46.209 --> 34:47.835
Just close the door.

34:47.919 --> 34:49.212
I told you last night.

34:49.295 --> 34:51.214
Because it lets the light in.

34:51.297 --> 34:52.173
These were exposed,

34:52.256 --> 34:53.299
they're fucked.

34:53.382 --> 34:55.468
But, Sara, you never told us.

34:55.551 --> 34:57.970
Well, of course!
A star couldn't sleep here.

34:58.054 --> 35:00.306
My bedbugs might bite them.

35:00.389 --> 35:01.224
What? No.

35:01.307 --> 35:02.141
Good morning.

35:02.225 --> 35:03.226
Son of a bitch!

35:03.309 --> 35:04.185
Good morning.

35:05.937 --> 35:08.022
I knew it was stupid.

35:09.148 --> 35:11.818
It was foolish of me
to accept Fashion Fest.

35:11.901 --> 35:13.277
I knew it and I did it anyway.

35:13.361 --> 35:14.821
I did it anyway, shit!

35:15.321 --> 35:16.989
Fuck everything!

35:20.451 --> 35:21.994
She gets that temper from Grandma.

35:22.078 --> 35:23.663
Forget about your bridal gown!

35:23.746 --> 35:24.789
Yikes.

35:24.872 --> 35:26.541
I don't think she had breakfast.

35:33.256 --> 35:37.176
Don't ask me

35:37.802 --> 35:41.222
If it's gone or not

35:42.682 --> 35:47.645
Don't ask me

35:48.271 --> 35:50.690
If it's over

35:52.650 --> 35:55.695
Because I have nothing to say

35:56.362 --> 35:59.198
I have nothing to tell you

35:59.282 --> 36:01.659
But since you've gone

36:02.243 --> 36:05.163
I haven't stopped crying, yeah

36:05.746 --> 36:07.498
Sara, you can't give up that easy.

36:07.582 --> 36:10.960
If I told you all the times I've failed…
Look at this one.

36:12.753 --> 36:13.796
"Chihuahua."

36:14.672 --> 36:16.924
-You look like a chihuahua.
-Very funny.

36:17.008 --> 36:18.634
No way!

36:19.218 --> 36:21.179
-Seriously…
-You also look like a bird.

36:21.262 --> 36:23.723
You look more
like a bird than a chihuahua, really.

36:23.806 --> 36:25.183
A bird looking for grubs.

36:26.893 --> 36:27.727
It's very good.

36:27.810 --> 36:30.062
You'll have to send it to me, please.

36:31.397 --> 36:32.231
What?

36:32.315 --> 36:36.235
There was going to be a protest
to cancel your concert?

36:36.319 --> 36:37.153
Yeah.

36:38.529 --> 36:41.240
It was a joke,
but, like, 1,000 assholes showed up.

36:41.324 --> 36:42.909
No! They showed up?

36:42.992 --> 36:43.826
Yeah.

36:43.910 --> 36:45.995
So you're more fucked than I am.

36:46.078 --> 36:46.913
I told you.

36:48.247 --> 36:51.000
Look, remember this song?

36:51.834 --> 36:52.668
Which?

36:53.753 --> 36:55.755
You're within me

36:56.505 --> 36:58.216
Until the final beat of my heart

36:58.299 --> 36:59.300
Ah, yes, I remember.

36:59.800 --> 37:02.720
In the light of your balcony

37:02.803 --> 37:05.932
In every minute, at every corner

37:06.015 --> 37:06.849
I like it.

37:06.933 --> 37:07.767
A lot.

37:09.310 --> 37:11.229
Some like it, some think it's shit.

37:11.938 --> 37:14.649
And some scream for it at concerts.

37:16.400 --> 37:17.235
Yeah?

37:18.069 --> 37:18.903
And you?

37:19.487 --> 37:20.571
And me?

37:20.655 --> 37:21.572
Do you like it?

37:22.990 --> 37:23.950
I like it a lot.

37:25.117 --> 37:26.244
I wrote it for you.

37:27.578 --> 37:28.454
For me?

37:29.413 --> 37:30.248
Why?

37:33.125 --> 37:34.502
Because you're my…

37:35.670 --> 37:36.754
best friend.

37:37.380 --> 37:40.049
And well, it doesn't matter
what others think.

37:44.011 --> 37:45.429
So what does matter?

37:46.681 --> 37:47.848
What you feel, here.

37:48.891 --> 37:49.809
Honey!

37:49.892 --> 37:50.851
-Come on!
-What?

37:50.935 --> 37:52.270
Go to sleep.

37:54.772 --> 37:55.898
I know.

37:55.982 --> 37:57.900
But he's your sister's fiance.

37:58.943 --> 38:01.279
Enough. My broken heart's plenty, Sara.

38:01.862 --> 38:02.697
Careful.

38:04.448 --> 38:05.283
Come.

38:06.742 --> 38:07.576
Go to sleep.

38:08.244 --> 38:09.662
Let's go to sleep. Here.

38:27.263 --> 38:28.097
Lucy.

38:29.724 --> 38:30.599
Are you okay?

38:34.061 --> 38:35.813
I don't think he wants to marry me.

38:38.065 --> 38:40.026
He only ever wrote songs for her.

38:42.403 --> 38:43.487
Her?

38:43.988 --> 38:45.990
His first love.

38:46.073 --> 38:49.452
The one that will be within him
until the final beat of his heart.

38:54.165 --> 38:56.751
Do you know who she is?

38:58.419 --> 38:59.253
I don't.

39:00.588 --> 39:03.215
Maybe a Spanish lover,

39:04.425 --> 39:06.844
or some Hungarian summer fling.

39:13.476 --> 39:15.436
Though, sometimes, I think it could be…

39:19.690 --> 39:23.402
that no one in the whole world
would want to spend their life with me.

39:27.156 --> 39:28.616
You're joking, right?

39:32.328 --> 39:33.162
Lucy…

39:34.872 --> 39:36.874
you're a diamond in the rough.

39:38.793 --> 39:40.586
And you have a huge heart.

39:41.796 --> 39:45.424
Anyone would be lucky
to spend their life with you.

39:48.719 --> 39:49.804
Starting with you?

39:50.304 --> 39:51.639
Starting with me,

39:52.348 --> 39:53.182
sis.

39:55.643 --> 39:56.977
Now can I rinse off?

39:57.061 --> 39:57.895
Hey.

40:00.940 --> 40:02.942
So will you make my dress?

40:06.028 --> 40:06.862
Obviously.

40:11.826 --> 40:12.660
Baby!

40:13.411 --> 40:14.245
Hi!

40:14.328 --> 40:15.162
How'd it go?

40:15.246 --> 40:16.539
-Very well.
-Yeah? Nice?

40:21.085 --> 40:22.545
-How are you?
-Good.

40:22.628 --> 40:23.838
-Good?
-Here.

40:23.921 --> 40:24.755
Look, touch.

40:24.839 --> 40:27.925
-It finally cooled down.
-They gave us a delicious facial.

40:28.008 --> 40:28.843
Touch it.

40:29.343 --> 40:31.595
-See? My love, I'm talking to you.
-Yeah.

40:39.228 --> 40:41.188
The most important thing is your peace.

40:42.398 --> 40:44.525
Your tranquility, your…

40:46.026 --> 40:49.697
Your stability,
because you're part of the…

40:51.115 --> 40:52.950
The show, as like--

40:53.033 --> 40:54.660
My love, you were sleeping.

40:55.286 --> 40:56.120
Sleep.

40:56.745 --> 40:58.205
Okay? Sleep tight.

41:08.549 --> 41:10.468
You have to stop, Sara.

41:12.720 --> 41:16.348
…we'll go to the top

41:16.432 --> 41:20.186
Of your favorite cloud

41:20.269 --> 41:22.313
And from there

41:24.815 --> 41:29.153
Our house will be in the sky

41:30.946 --> 41:37.328
We'll hang a sign
Outside the door

41:37.912 --> 41:39.872
"Please…

41:41.874 --> 41:45.169
Do not disturb"

41:48.506 --> 41:49.340
Come on.

41:49.423 --> 41:51.675
-Why?
-Bring your fabric.

41:51.759 --> 41:53.469
And the chemicals. Come.

41:53.552 --> 41:54.720
-Right now?
-Yes.

41:58.891 --> 42:01.060
Come on, get in.
We're gonna hunt flamingos.

42:01.143 --> 42:04.104
I'm scared, Aarón. What flamingos?

42:04.188 --> 42:06.315
More like crocodiles than flamingos.

42:07.233 --> 42:10.236
I mean, you do get
that my flamingo feather design

42:10.319 --> 42:12.071
is nothing more than fantasy?

42:12.154 --> 42:13.864
We don't have to make it real.

42:14.406 --> 42:16.534
Well, that's why. Fantasies are the best.

42:18.285 --> 42:20.621
Trust me. We'll find them.

42:20.704 --> 42:21.789
Then what's the plan?

42:22.414 --> 42:26.335
I mean, you want me to pluck the feathers
of a sleeping flamingo. Is that it?

42:26.919 --> 42:28.504
We already stole the boat.

42:31.215 --> 42:32.633
No, I'm going to steal them.

42:41.517 --> 42:44.562
Hey. Have you found
what you were searching for?

42:46.063 --> 42:47.064
Well…

42:47.565 --> 42:51.110
I came here to set up
a secret, clandestine studio.

42:51.902 --> 42:53.362
I'm writing some songs

42:53.445 --> 42:55.364
that I don't want anyone
to find out about.

42:57.908 --> 43:00.369
It's kind of personal.

43:02.037 --> 43:03.205
How mysterious.

43:03.998 --> 43:04.873
Why?

43:06.542 --> 43:08.836
Because maybe I still
have something to prove.

43:10.546 --> 43:11.880
That I have my own voice.

43:12.464 --> 43:14.133
And that's why you're so set

43:14.216 --> 43:15.926
on me finding my own too?

43:20.431 --> 43:21.599
Look, there's one!

43:23.892 --> 43:25.185
Wow!

43:26.645 --> 43:28.606
It's a flamingo feather!

43:30.899 --> 43:32.526
Wow! It's incredible.

44:27.539 --> 44:28.916
It's incredible!

44:30.542 --> 44:31.502
Thank you.

44:32.336 --> 44:33.921
We've always helped each other.

44:35.089 --> 44:35.923
You and me.

44:37.174 --> 44:38.008
Sara.

44:42.137 --> 44:42.971
I missed you.

44:43.555 --> 44:44.390
And I you.

44:45.891 --> 44:48.268
See, Sara? See how you can want things?

44:52.231 --> 44:54.817
Right now I just want Lucy
to like the dress.

44:54.900 --> 44:56.652
Because if she doesn't, I'll freak.

44:56.735 --> 44:57.945
Lucy.

44:59.321 --> 45:01.407
It's just all this with the ring,
the wedding,

45:01.490 --> 45:03.701
it's going so quick, it was impulsive.

45:05.411 --> 45:06.245
What?

45:07.204 --> 45:10.082
Well, it just went very fast,

45:10.165 --> 45:13.043
but it's all good.

45:19.466 --> 45:21.802
You'll be within me

45:22.511 --> 45:25.639
Until the final beat of my heart

45:25.723 --> 45:28.267
In the light of your balcony

45:28.851 --> 45:32.354
In every minute, at every corner

45:33.230 --> 45:35.441
You'll be within me

45:36.233 --> 45:38.736
Even though we've said goodbye

45:43.657 --> 45:46.744
And in the morning breeze

45:46.827 --> 45:51.874
I mistook your scent for a rose

45:55.919 --> 45:58.672
I awake in the early morning…

45:59.798 --> 46:00.632
You?

46:01.592 --> 46:02.843
Expecting someone else?

46:04.470 --> 46:05.429
You!

46:05.512 --> 46:06.346
Me.

46:06.930 --> 46:07.806
Hey,

46:08.474 --> 46:10.726
I've been thinking a lot,

46:10.809 --> 46:11.894
about lots of things.

46:12.436 --> 46:14.813
And I'm ready to tell you.

46:16.899 --> 46:18.108
-Okay.
-Okay.

46:18.984 --> 46:19.985
Okay.

46:20.068 --> 46:23.572
If you want, let's try one last time.

46:23.655 --> 46:24.490
Okay, yeah.

46:25.783 --> 46:26.867
No. Look.

46:26.950 --> 46:28.243
One last time?

46:28.952 --> 46:30.746
No. What I…

46:31.246 --> 46:33.081
What I wanted to say is…

46:34.708 --> 46:36.376
I'm going to come live in Mérida.

46:37.419 --> 46:38.253
In Mérida!

46:41.799 --> 46:43.926
Oh, wow!

46:44.426 --> 46:47.763
Wow! Okay.

46:48.931 --> 46:50.349
Wow.

46:50.432 --> 46:51.266
Yeah.

46:53.977 --> 46:55.187
Here you are.

46:55.270 --> 46:56.146
I'm gonna change.

46:56.230 --> 46:57.064
Did you tell her?

46:57.147 --> 46:59.274
Did you tell her? I helped.
I picked the ring…

46:59.358 --> 47:00.526
Sara! Don't listen.

47:00.609 --> 47:02.611
-Hey, sir! I don't want to see that.
-No!

47:02.694 --> 47:04.947
-Okay!
-Cover up, my love.

47:06.448 --> 47:07.950
Okay, family.

47:08.033 --> 47:10.786
I have a ton of things to do,
dresses, Fashion Fest,

47:10.869 --> 47:12.538
a wedding to plan, so…

47:12.621 --> 47:13.455
Yeah.

47:13.539 --> 47:14.873
I'm off! Okay?

47:14.957 --> 47:15.791
Yeah.

47:17.209 --> 47:18.377
Hey.

47:18.460 --> 47:19.711
-Go after her!
-Not now.

47:20.921 --> 47:23.048
No, hey, I need you to listen to me.

47:24.216 --> 47:25.634
I need you to listen to me!

47:34.268 --> 47:35.352
You're divine.

47:35.435 --> 47:39.982
Moni, please, a little more volume.

47:40.774 --> 47:41.859
Let's see, Charly.

47:41.942 --> 47:43.443
I don't know what to do with her.

47:43.527 --> 47:44.653
She's too pale.

47:45.737 --> 47:47.906
No. Change everything, please. No.

47:52.578 --> 47:54.621
Rick! The rack, please!

47:54.705 --> 47:55.539
Okay.

47:56.081 --> 47:57.040
Here it is.

48:00.210 --> 48:01.628
I have more in the car.

48:04.590 --> 48:06.717
They're much better than these, I think.

48:10.637 --> 48:12.764
You hate them. Do you hate me?

48:13.390 --> 48:14.391
I'll burn them.

48:14.474 --> 48:16.018
You're brilliant, Sara Escribano.

48:16.852 --> 48:17.811
They're perfect!

48:18.937 --> 48:20.689
-I told you, amore.
-They're alive!

48:21.440 --> 48:22.691
Told you too, Sari.

48:23.650 --> 48:24.985
Congratulations!

48:25.068 --> 48:26.069
Congratulations!

48:26.653 --> 48:29.156
Marina Abramóvich was right.

48:31.658 --> 48:32.534
Hey!

48:32.618 --> 48:34.870
Fire! Sacni, the dresses!

48:34.953 --> 48:35.871
Fuck this!

48:35.954 --> 48:37.122
-I quit!
-The dresses!

48:37.623 --> 48:38.457
Let's go!

48:39.124 --> 48:40.584
Go, quickly!

48:40.667 --> 48:42.419
You're in charge of everything!

48:42.502 --> 48:43.337
-Me?
-Yeah!

48:44.254 --> 48:45.505
What?

48:46.423 --> 48:47.257
What the hell?

48:49.343 --> 48:50.177
Are you okay?

48:51.637 --> 48:54.348
Where is Colavita? Anyone seen Colavita?

48:54.431 --> 48:56.016
-Where is my third outfit?
-Sara?

48:56.725 --> 48:58.185
-What're you doing?
-No, Aarón.

48:58.268 --> 48:59.895
For real, I need five minutes.

48:59.978 --> 49:01.521
-I need to be alone.
-Relax.

49:02.189 --> 49:03.065
-No.
-Breathe, Sara.

49:03.148 --> 49:04.232
Five minutes, guys.

49:04.316 --> 49:05.150
I can't.

49:07.069 --> 49:09.905
No, really. I don't know how to meditate.
Don't make me.

49:09.988 --> 49:10.822
Me neither.

49:11.949 --> 49:14.576
But, before each concert
I do it and it relaxes me.

49:21.959 --> 49:22.793
What's so funny?

49:22.876 --> 49:24.419
Aarón Star gets nervous?

49:24.503 --> 49:26.755
Well, "Aarón Star," no.

49:26.838 --> 49:28.382
But I do.

49:28.924 --> 49:29.758
Look.

49:29.841 --> 49:30.717
I'm shaking.

49:30.801 --> 49:32.094
-No!
-I'm sweating.

49:33.303 --> 49:34.221
Calm down.

49:38.308 --> 49:39.434
What are you doing?

49:39.518 --> 49:40.644
Meditating.

49:41.353 --> 49:44.439
A big round of applause for Aarón Star!

49:49.277 --> 49:51.029
I'm going to chew you up, girl

49:58.370 --> 49:59.371
You're my bubblegum

49:59.955 --> 50:01.832
-Let this flow.
-That's it.

50:01.915 --> 50:03.250
You're my cinnamon gum

50:04.501 --> 50:06.128
Fluff up the dress, Sacni.

50:08.588 --> 50:12.342
You're my cinnamon gum, baby

50:12.426 --> 50:16.096
I won't stop
Until my tongue goes numb

50:18.140 --> 50:21.393
That's it. Grand. Shine, girls.
Like never before!

50:21.476 --> 50:23.061
I'll remove that red dress

50:23.145 --> 50:25.605
With no doubt, kiss your neck

50:25.689 --> 50:27.399
Enjoying it like a bear

50:27.482 --> 50:29.317
Big! Yes! There we go!

50:30.277 --> 50:33.905
Heading direct to the sweet spot
Ignoring the danger

50:33.989 --> 50:36.491
That's it. Yes. He's already going. Copy?

50:37.701 --> 50:39.244
Yes. Preparing Lucy.

50:39.327 --> 50:43.248
-Am I good?
-Let me check this. Okay, yeah. All good.

50:43.331 --> 50:44.374
Ready, Lucy?

50:45.375 --> 50:46.209
Lucy.

50:46.293 --> 50:47.753
-Ready.
-Right, let's go.

50:49.963 --> 50:51.631
Sacni! How exciting!

50:58.805 --> 51:00.474
Bravo, my love!

51:02.809 --> 51:04.644
Ladies and gentlemen,

51:06.480 --> 51:09.816
let's hear it for Aarón Star.

51:09.900 --> 51:11.568
Lucy and Sara Escribano!

51:11.651 --> 51:12.736
Breathe.

51:12.819 --> 51:13.904
Stand up straight.

51:13.987 --> 51:15.155
-This is your moment.
-Me?

51:15.238 --> 51:16.448
-Yes. Ready?
-I'm going?

51:16.531 --> 51:19.284
-Yes, you'll shine.
-Bye, bad karma. Let's go.

51:20.327 --> 51:21.161
Seriously?

51:22.037 --> 51:24.331
-No! How embarrassing.
-Let's go, Sara!

51:25.415 --> 51:26.583
-No, wait.
-Come on!

51:26.666 --> 51:27.584
Come, let's go.

51:28.168 --> 51:29.544
I can't believe it.

51:29.628 --> 51:32.589
And the genius behind all these designs,

51:32.672 --> 51:35.634
a woman with incomparable talent

51:35.717 --> 51:37.636
who's able to brand all the fabrics,

51:37.719 --> 51:39.096
she can do it for all the--

51:39.179 --> 51:41.848
My sister. Sara Escribano!

51:50.232 --> 51:52.234
Come on.

51:52.984 --> 51:55.570
What the fuck is up with this headache?

52:01.910 --> 52:03.995
Oh, bless you.

52:16.216 --> 52:17.050
Aarón?

52:17.801 --> 52:18.635
What?

52:18.718 --> 52:20.762
You'll be within me

52:28.436 --> 52:31.481
Until the final beat of my heart

52:35.402 --> 52:36.486
What is this?

52:37.445 --> 52:40.615
Salamba sirshasana is what this is called.

52:44.452 --> 52:45.495
No, idiot.

52:45.579 --> 52:46.413
What's this?

52:47.664 --> 52:49.207
A gift. What?

52:49.833 --> 52:50.709
You didn't like it?

52:50.792 --> 52:52.961
Why did you hold onto this for so long?

52:53.044 --> 52:54.713
Because it's super special.

52:54.796 --> 52:56.464
Why dedicate your first album to me?

52:57.048 --> 52:59.384
Because I want you to hear--

52:59.467 --> 53:01.428
No. Why do you want to help my hangover?

53:01.511 --> 53:02.470
Look, Sara…

53:03.054 --> 53:05.557
I heard you puking all night.

53:05.640 --> 53:07.893
What the hell is going on in your head?

53:07.976 --> 53:09.311
Nothing is going on, just…

53:10.645 --> 53:12.606
-It just is, Aarón.
-I do.

53:12.689 --> 53:14.274
-I do too.
-Yes!

53:14.357 --> 53:15.192
Well, me too.

53:17.444 --> 53:18.653
Yes!

53:18.737 --> 53:19.654
Yes, what?

53:19.738 --> 53:21.656
Yes, I'll marry you, Roberto!

53:21.740 --> 53:22.949
Yes!

53:23.033 --> 53:24.409
Yes. You. Very good.

53:25.076 --> 53:26.077
Me?

53:28.038 --> 53:29.206
What?

53:29.289 --> 53:31.458
Hey, congratulations, brother-in-law!

53:31.541 --> 53:32.375
Thanks so much.

53:32.459 --> 53:35.337
-Welcome to the family!
-Thanks so much. Yeah.

53:35.420 --> 53:37.047
-That was cool.
-Incredible!

53:37.130 --> 53:40.926
I was really excited about asking.

53:41.009 --> 53:43.762
I mean, saying, "Do you want to marry me?"

53:43.845 --> 53:47.766
I even learned to ask in English,
I'm not gonna lie.

53:50.477 --> 53:51.394
Look at the fans.

53:51.478 --> 53:55.273
Temperature is 35° Celsius in the shade.

53:55.357 --> 53:58.193
Hey, look at that!

53:58.276 --> 53:59.236
Different colors.

53:59.319 --> 54:00.654
Which would you like?

54:00.737 --> 54:02.364
-Thank you.
-Have a nice day.

54:02.447 --> 54:03.281
You too.

54:03.365 --> 54:04.658
-Ta-da!
-No.

54:04.741 --> 54:05.784
I'll be back.

54:07.994 --> 54:10.080
-Thank you. It's lovely.
-Have a nice day.

54:11.456 --> 54:13.166
What a scam.

54:13.250 --> 54:15.502
You should have bought an iPad.
This doesn't work.

54:15.585 --> 54:18.880
Your boyfriend's profile picture is fake.

54:18.964 --> 54:21.424
You can't trust social media.

54:21.508 --> 54:22.509
You're an adult.

54:24.010 --> 54:24.844
He's a scammer.

54:24.928 --> 54:27.264
These photos were taken
from a Swiss tie catalog.

54:27.347 --> 54:29.641
Yeah, Lauterbrunnen ties.

54:30.767 --> 54:32.352
Since when do you speak German?

54:33.186 --> 54:34.145
Since he taught me.

54:35.397 --> 54:36.439
He's Swiss.

54:38.608 --> 54:39.776
He's a model.

54:39.859 --> 54:42.070
He exists and his name is Hans.

54:44.823 --> 54:46.700
Like those crêpes we had.

54:47.242 --> 54:48.827
Which ones?

54:48.910 --> 54:51.871
The ones we used to eat daily.
Remember? Right after marrying.

54:52.580 --> 54:55.375
The ones on the corner
of our first apartment?

54:55.458 --> 54:56.835
With the little sausages?

54:56.918 --> 54:59.004
Remember how the smell
came through the window?

54:59.587 --> 55:00.422
Yeah.

55:04.592 --> 55:06.886
Wanna dance? Does your Swiss man dance?

55:10.015 --> 55:10.974
For old times.

55:12.309 --> 55:13.935
Let's see if I remember.

55:14.019 --> 55:15.937
Of course you remember, you'll see.

55:16.688 --> 55:17.647
Let's see.

55:18.815 --> 55:20.817
This one is a square, right?

55:21.609 --> 55:24.112
A square and a swing, at least.

55:24.195 --> 55:25.864
Now, with energy!

55:29.326 --> 55:32.287
Slow and sensual!

55:33.413 --> 55:35.081
This is really hard.

55:35.165 --> 55:36.166
There it is.

55:36.249 --> 55:37.083
Ready.

55:38.126 --> 55:39.961
Perfect. Don't move too much.

55:40.045 --> 55:40.879
Okay.

55:42.422 --> 55:43.715
There we go.

55:44.466 --> 55:45.342
Ready.

55:45.425 --> 55:46.259
Let's see.

55:50.013 --> 55:52.599
If you want to change anything,
there's still time.

55:54.893 --> 55:55.727
No way.

55:57.020 --> 55:59.981
Or if you want to add anything,
really, I won't be offended.

56:04.569 --> 56:05.403
Really?

56:05.487 --> 56:07.238
Sara, I love it!

56:07.322 --> 56:09.324
It couldn't be more spectacular!

56:09.407 --> 56:10.950
Well, there we go then.

56:11.034 --> 56:11.868
You're the best.

56:13.745 --> 56:16.164
And now, the world is on the verge
of knowing it.

56:16.831 --> 56:18.208
Sara Escribano.

56:24.214 --> 56:27.384
When I looked on Google,
it said to open it like this…

56:27.467 --> 56:28.468
My love, lemme see.

56:28.551 --> 56:30.512
-I'll help you.
-No. I can do it.

56:30.595 --> 56:32.597
-There…
-Pull, you don't have to twist it.

56:32.680 --> 56:33.723
-There.
-Yeah.

56:33.807 --> 56:36.684
-Then, carefully, because the cork is…
-Turn it.

56:36.768 --> 56:38.436
…under a lot of pressure

56:38.520 --> 56:40.438
and can take out an eye.

56:40.522 --> 56:42.524
Point away from you, so you don't hurt…

56:42.607 --> 56:44.943
Look, let me do it. Let's put this here.

56:46.027 --> 56:47.404
Just turn it.

56:50.198 --> 56:51.449
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

56:52.575 --> 56:53.868
To our wedding.

57:01.292 --> 57:02.127
It's good.

57:06.881 --> 57:08.258
Tell me something dirty.

57:11.469 --> 57:12.595
Something dirty like…

57:13.888 --> 57:16.975
Like, sexual? Or like, sexy…

57:17.058 --> 57:19.978
Like coitus, fornication, right?

57:20.061 --> 57:22.689
I mean sex…

57:22.772 --> 57:24.399
Tell me something to turn me on.

57:24.482 --> 57:26.860
Sweaty sex. Sex with sweat.

57:26.943 --> 57:28.653
Sex with sweat.

57:28.736 --> 57:29.946
And since it's Mérida,

57:30.029 --> 57:33.324
it's even hotter, and the humidity factor
comes into play.

57:33.408 --> 57:35.743
And then, we'd be even sweatier, right?

57:35.827 --> 57:38.955
My love, I want to feel you inside me.

57:39.998 --> 57:40.832
Here?

57:41.458 --> 57:43.209
What will it take to get you to play?

57:43.835 --> 57:46.754
-Shit.
-Can't we just have normal sex?

57:46.838 --> 57:48.381
Like that, like before?

57:50.550 --> 57:51.384
Yeah.

57:57.015 --> 57:59.517
You'll be within me

58:06.107 --> 58:07.525
What are you humming, Sara?

58:10.778 --> 58:11.821
The wedding march.

58:12.572 --> 58:13.406
Oh.

58:13.948 --> 58:14.782
Sexy.

58:31.216 --> 58:33.510
-I love him, Sacni.
-Roberto?

58:39.474 --> 58:40.850
I can't do this to Lucy.

58:42.185 --> 58:43.144
Of course.

58:43.228 --> 58:45.313
It's healthier
to organize a double wedding

58:45.396 --> 58:48.858
with your sister, your fiance,
and the love of your life, right?

58:48.942 --> 58:51.486
No. I didn't say anything
about a double wedding.

58:53.238 --> 58:54.072
That's good.

58:56.574 --> 59:00.119
Sacni, I need a time machine
so I can go back to high school.

59:01.246 --> 59:03.623
Everything was perfect then.
That was my moment.

59:04.290 --> 59:05.208
And I let it pass.

59:06.084 --> 59:07.418
Because of your bad karma?

59:14.384 --> 59:16.553
He's about to plan his move to Mérida.

59:16.636 --> 59:17.470
He's coming.

59:17.971 --> 59:19.681
I don't want him to. What do I do?

59:19.764 --> 59:21.724
Leave Roberto to me.

59:22.225 --> 59:24.644
I'm a pro
at getting city slickers to leave.

59:25.687 --> 59:26.646
What will you do?

59:26.729 --> 59:27.855
Hello, my love!

59:29.274 --> 59:30.942
Hello? Sara?

59:31.442 --> 59:32.277
Bobby.

59:34.571 --> 59:36.990
Look, Bobby,
you have to walk here in Mérida.

59:37.073 --> 59:37.991
Okay.

59:38.074 --> 59:42.537
-It is beautiful, but it's so hot!
-Yeah.

59:42.620 --> 59:43.621
Enjoy it, Bobby!

59:43.705 --> 59:49.544
This is the most important time
of the day. Feel the sun on your body.

59:50.169 --> 59:51.796
I mean, a bit of water

59:51.879 --> 59:53.006
and boom!

59:53.673 --> 59:56.342
But, isn't there water?

59:59.554 --> 1:00:00.471
Come on, let's go!

1:00:02.056 --> 1:00:03.474
Don't you know the cenotes?

1:00:04.225 --> 1:00:05.518
-Come on, Bobby.
-Sara?

1:00:06.561 --> 1:00:09.606
Sara's waiting for us,
so you can't stop here.

1:00:10.148 --> 1:00:11.232
-Okay.
-Come on.

1:00:15.653 --> 1:00:18.531
Sara is very late, no?

1:00:18.615 --> 1:00:20.283
Can't we wait in the shade?

1:00:20.992 --> 1:00:22.952
Patience, Bobby.

1:00:23.036 --> 1:00:25.538
In Mérida, time doesn't matter.

1:00:25.622 --> 1:00:27.206
Yeah, but Sara isn't from here.

1:00:27.915 --> 1:00:29.584
She might as well be.

1:00:29.667 --> 1:00:32.670
If you saw how much she's changed
since coming here…

1:00:32.754 --> 1:00:34.255
No, I already noticed.

1:00:34.339 --> 1:00:35.423
Right?

1:00:35.506 --> 1:00:37.342
She's picked up bad habits.

1:00:37.425 --> 1:00:38.843
You wouldn't recognize her.

1:00:41.095 --> 1:00:41.929
Hey.

1:00:44.515 --> 1:00:45.350
What?

1:00:45.433 --> 1:00:49.312
You know what? If you're moving to Mérida,
you should adapt.

1:00:49.395 --> 1:00:51.105
-To Maya?
-And to the heat.

1:00:52.899 --> 1:00:54.734
Well, it's not that bad.

1:00:54.817 --> 1:00:57.654
With air conditioning,
everything is better, no?

1:00:58.279 --> 1:00:59.155
Of course.

1:00:59.238 --> 1:01:00.406
Bad part is the price.

1:01:01.157 --> 1:01:02.075
Is it expensive?

1:01:02.659 --> 1:01:04.786
Where you are, at least 2,000.

1:01:04.869 --> 1:01:06.204
No, 2,000 is okay.

1:01:06.287 --> 1:01:08.081
I can manage 2,000 well.

1:01:08.164 --> 1:01:08.998
Weekly.

1:01:09.582 --> 1:01:10.625
Oh, no.

1:01:10.708 --> 1:01:12.377
And, ice cream?

1:01:12.460 --> 1:01:14.754
If you say it in Maya, it's on me, Bobby.

1:01:16.798 --> 1:01:17.632
Sara?

1:01:21.344 --> 1:01:22.679
This guy's dead.

1:01:26.599 --> 1:01:27.642
I'm alive?

1:01:29.894 --> 1:01:30.812
That's correct.

1:01:32.021 --> 1:01:33.898
Don't worry about the dengue.

1:01:33.981 --> 1:01:34.857
It's not serious.

1:01:39.028 --> 1:01:40.029
I have dengue?

1:01:41.322 --> 1:01:42.448
And heatstroke.

1:01:42.532 --> 1:01:44.826
But you'll survive.

1:01:45.326 --> 1:01:46.160
Ah.

1:01:46.244 --> 1:01:49.080
So, you'll have to learn to live
with my bad karma.

1:01:50.039 --> 1:01:51.290
Bad karma?

1:01:51.374 --> 1:01:54.711
I'm the one under the effects
of strong drugs, Sara.

1:01:56.254 --> 1:01:57.630
I'm being serious, Roberto.

1:01:57.714 --> 1:01:59.465
My life is one string of bad luck.

1:02:03.261 --> 1:02:05.805
Your life with me feels like bad luck?

1:02:06.472 --> 1:02:07.515
No, hold on.

1:02:07.598 --> 1:02:09.976
Don't put words in my mouth
that I haven't said.

1:02:10.768 --> 1:02:14.105
I'm just saying my bad luck
is very contagious.

1:02:14.188 --> 1:02:15.314
Very.

1:02:16.065 --> 1:02:16.899
Sara,

1:02:17.692 --> 1:02:20.611
did you send Sacnité
to scare me out of moving?

1:02:22.822 --> 1:02:25.366
Do you have any idea what I'm sacrificing

1:02:25.450 --> 1:02:27.368
to come live in Mérida with you?

1:02:28.578 --> 1:02:29.412
Well…

1:02:30.079 --> 1:02:32.707
that's exactly why I'm trying to--

1:02:32.790 --> 1:02:33.666
Frighten me?

1:02:33.750 --> 1:02:34.584
No!

1:02:34.667 --> 1:02:35.710
Warn me?

1:02:37.628 --> 1:02:40.339
Sara, I was very happy to come here.

1:02:41.549 --> 1:02:44.051
But I was also afraid that maybe

1:02:44.135 --> 1:02:47.930
our relationship only existed in memories.

1:02:48.514 --> 1:02:50.224
And coming here confirmed it.

1:02:52.602 --> 1:02:53.436
Look, Roberto…

1:02:55.938 --> 1:02:57.482
I love you very much

1:02:57.565 --> 1:02:59.942
and we've always gotten along so well.

1:03:00.902 --> 1:03:02.945
And you're a man who's very…

1:03:03.738 --> 1:03:05.823
Well, very punctual.

1:03:05.907 --> 1:03:07.074
Oh, thanks.

1:03:08.075 --> 1:03:10.161
And very protective, you know?

1:03:10.244 --> 1:03:11.913
-And also--
-Sara, I'm fine.

1:03:14.123 --> 1:03:14.957
I'm happy.

1:03:16.667 --> 1:03:19.504
And I want you to be happy.
You deserve to be happy.

1:03:20.171 --> 1:03:23.466
But you can't be happy

1:03:23.549 --> 1:03:25.802
if you're not where you want to be.

1:03:27.220 --> 1:03:29.347
And you want…

1:03:31.974 --> 1:03:33.309
cinnamon gum.

1:03:36.145 --> 1:03:37.146
And I'm not that.

1:03:40.024 --> 1:03:41.818
I also love you very much, Sara.

1:03:44.278 --> 1:03:46.113
-Sorry!
-No, it's okay.

1:03:46.197 --> 1:03:47.448
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

1:03:50.368 --> 1:03:51.202
Hey,

1:03:52.495 --> 1:03:54.664
the ring you got me is super pretty.

1:03:55.164 --> 1:03:56.123
Thank you.

1:03:57.041 --> 1:03:57.875
Ah.

1:03:59.001 --> 1:04:01.838
Hey, so about the ring,

1:04:03.047 --> 1:04:05.424
would it be an inconvenience
to give it back?

1:04:05.508 --> 1:04:07.343
It's just that it was my grandma's.

1:04:07.426 --> 1:04:09.846
And has been passed
from generation to generation.

1:04:09.929 --> 1:04:11.180
No, I understand perfectly.

1:04:11.264 --> 1:04:13.182
-No need to explain.
-Thank you.

1:04:13.266 --> 1:04:14.809
It's yours.

1:04:14.892 --> 1:04:15.935
-Okay?
-Okay.

1:04:22.608 --> 1:04:25.194
Miss, can you give us five minutes?

1:04:25.278 --> 1:04:27.113
-Of course.
-Just while we break up.

1:04:27.196 --> 1:04:28.281
-Absolutely.
-Yeah?

1:04:28.364 --> 1:04:29.198
Thank you.

1:04:35.329 --> 1:04:36.497
Sara, your hand.

1:04:37.748 --> 1:04:39.375
It's missing the ring!

1:04:41.085 --> 1:04:43.045
Is your wedding canceled, Sara?

1:04:47.174 --> 1:04:48.050
Mmm-hmm.

1:04:49.594 --> 1:04:50.720
My wedding is canceled.

1:04:51.929 --> 1:04:53.389
What happened, Sari?

1:04:57.184 --> 1:04:58.561
Better ask him.

1:04:58.644 --> 1:05:00.146
Roberto decided.

1:05:00.980 --> 1:05:03.065
-The distance, right?
-What distance?

1:05:03.149 --> 1:05:04.358
He was moving to Mérida.

1:05:04.442 --> 1:05:07.695
-It wasn't that, what happened?
-He's a man. They get tedious.

1:05:07.778 --> 1:05:10.865
Better now than 30 years
down the line, right?

1:05:12.825 --> 1:05:16.871
We'll go to the top

1:05:16.954 --> 1:05:21.042
Of your favorite cloud

1:05:21.125 --> 1:05:23.294
And from there

1:05:24.587 --> 1:05:28.758
Our house will be in the sky

1:05:29.634 --> 1:05:36.140
We'll hang a sign
Outside the door

1:05:37.141 --> 1:05:38.559
"Please…"

1:05:38.643 --> 1:05:39.477
Here.

1:05:40.436 --> 1:05:43.314
Okay, this will be the groom's room.

1:05:43.397 --> 1:05:44.857
It's the master suite.

1:05:44.941 --> 1:05:46.442
Thank you, my wedding planner.

1:05:46.525 --> 1:05:48.611
Wow! How pretty!

1:05:48.694 --> 1:05:51.238
These are your last hours
of happiness, brother.

1:05:51.322 --> 1:05:53.407
-Dad, don't be rash.
-Okay.

1:05:53.491 --> 1:05:55.701
Okay, everyone else, with me.

1:05:58.371 --> 1:05:59.580
Hey, Sara.

1:05:59.664 --> 1:06:01.582
-Do you have a minute to…
-Hey, Sarita.

1:06:02.416 --> 1:06:03.626
-God, Dad.
-I just want…

1:06:04.210 --> 1:06:06.212
I just want to tell you--

1:06:06.295 --> 1:06:08.631
Surprise!

1:06:10.633 --> 1:06:11.801
Tomorrow's the day!

1:06:13.552 --> 1:06:15.888
Okay, thank you.

1:06:17.848 --> 1:06:19.308
To the bride and groom!

1:06:26.524 --> 1:06:28.317
-Hans.
-What?

1:06:28.401 --> 1:06:29.235
Hans.

1:06:29.902 --> 1:06:30.736
Hans what?

1:06:30.820 --> 1:06:31.779
Hans.

1:06:31.862 --> 1:06:32.780
The crêpe guy.

1:06:37.201 --> 1:06:38.411
-He exists.
-Yes.

1:06:40.705 --> 1:06:42.164
With his green shirt.

1:06:42.248 --> 1:06:43.416
Yes. Sexy.

1:06:52.967 --> 1:06:53.801
You won.

1:06:57.304 --> 1:06:58.431
That's great.

1:07:01.100 --> 1:07:03.477
Thank you for
the best 32 years of my life.

1:07:09.817 --> 1:07:10.693
Excuse me.

1:07:21.370 --> 1:07:22.288
Hans?

1:07:23.873 --> 1:07:24.832
Sir.

1:07:24.915 --> 1:07:28.044
Ready, I have the most beautiful suite
here reserved for you.

1:07:29.128 --> 1:07:29.962
Thanks so much.

1:07:30.046 --> 1:07:31.047
Shall we?

1:07:31.130 --> 1:07:32.965
Of course. Let's go.

1:07:33.049 --> 1:07:34.508
-You'll love it.
-Yeah?

1:07:34.592 --> 1:07:37.595
It's beautiful.
This estate is famous for its golf.

1:07:37.678 --> 1:07:40.139
-Germany?
-Excuse me. We're going to the room.

1:07:40.931 --> 1:07:41.766
Ah.

1:08:35.027 --> 1:08:37.279
Lucy! How does it feel?

1:08:37.363 --> 1:08:38.322
Goddess, Lucy!

1:08:38.405 --> 1:08:39.573
Lucy! How does it feel?

1:08:39.657 --> 1:08:40.658
What?

1:08:40.741 --> 1:08:42.451
Marrying the love of your life?

1:08:42.535 --> 1:08:43.494
How does it feel?

1:08:50.960 --> 1:08:53.045
The dress designer is my sister

1:08:53.129 --> 1:08:54.088
Sara Escribano.

1:09:00.177 --> 1:09:01.971
You don't know how beautiful she is.

1:09:02.054 --> 1:09:03.347
Look at her run!

1:09:03.430 --> 1:09:05.599
This is the event of the year.

1:09:07.143 --> 1:09:09.145
-Lucy! What did you do?
-What?

1:09:09.228 --> 1:09:12.273
I've thousands of notifications
on Instagram, they love your dress.

1:09:12.356 --> 1:09:14.024
Ah, yes. Tell me.

1:09:16.110 --> 1:09:18.028
Where does your inspiration come from?

1:09:19.155 --> 1:09:22.533
How does it feel
to have been born with so much talent?

1:09:22.616 --> 1:09:23.868
So silly.

1:09:24.410 --> 1:09:27.371
Will you become
your sister's official designer?

1:09:27.454 --> 1:09:29.039
-Enough, Lucy!
-No, Sara.

1:09:29.790 --> 1:09:30.749
-What.
-I'm serious.

1:09:31.542 --> 1:09:33.419
Will you be my official designer?

1:09:34.128 --> 1:09:35.880
I have a job offer in Milan.

1:09:42.887 --> 1:09:46.056
I need to get Mom to hurry,
or she'll be late.

1:09:46.140 --> 1:09:47.600
Come with me, if you want.

1:09:47.683 --> 1:09:50.060
I mean, but, yeah, no?

1:09:50.144 --> 1:09:52.396
Maybe? I'll think about it?

1:09:53.939 --> 1:09:55.441
Girls!

1:09:55.524 --> 1:09:58.819
Knock before coming in, girls!

1:09:58.903 --> 1:10:01.030
Mom, it's cool,

1:10:01.113 --> 1:10:02.489
love is love,

1:10:02.573 --> 1:10:05.910
but you can't fuck some dude
with Dad in the next room.

1:10:06.702 --> 1:10:07.703
Show your face.

1:10:10.331 --> 1:10:11.373
Lucy, it's Dad.

1:10:13.626 --> 1:10:14.460
Daddy!

1:10:14.960 --> 1:10:15.794
Hi, Lu.

1:10:16.378 --> 1:10:19.089
Loves, don't try to understand, okay?

1:10:19.173 --> 1:10:22.968
The thing with Hans was so your dad
would try harder, and it worked.

1:10:24.261 --> 1:10:26.305
Love is love.

1:10:26.388 --> 1:10:27.264
How does it feel?

1:10:27.848 --> 1:10:28.682
What?

1:10:29.183 --> 1:10:30.893
To love someone, how does it feel?

1:10:31.518 --> 1:10:33.062
An explosion of happiness.

1:10:35.439 --> 1:10:36.899
I feel alive again.

1:10:36.982 --> 1:10:38.984
Okay, your chat is very inspirational,

1:10:39.068 --> 1:10:41.320
but we should come back to this later.

1:10:41.403 --> 1:10:42.529
Let's go, Lucy.

1:10:43.197 --> 1:10:45.241
Yeah. I…

1:10:45.324 --> 1:10:47.576
You guys keep doing what you were doing.
All good.

1:10:47.660 --> 1:10:48.661
All good.

1:11:01.215 --> 1:11:02.341
I need you to change.

1:11:02.424 --> 1:11:03.968
Everyone is here for the ceremony.

1:11:04.051 --> 1:11:05.052
Yeah.

1:11:05.135 --> 1:11:07.137
Yeah, I'm going. I'm running.

1:11:14.853 --> 1:11:18.774
MAY YOU BE VERY HAPPY, BROTHER-IN-LAW

1:11:31.537 --> 1:11:33.080
I saw them. They'll be here.

1:11:48.262 --> 1:11:49.596
What? Come in.

1:11:53.434 --> 1:11:55.769
I'm sorry I'm not dressed yet.
I just haven't…

1:11:56.687 --> 1:11:58.856
They haven't brought the…

1:11:58.939 --> 1:12:02.484
Marta hasn't brought me
Sara's suit yet and…

1:12:03.319 --> 1:12:04.486
I hate your music.

1:12:08.365 --> 1:12:10.492
I can't stand
your little influencer world.

1:12:10.576 --> 1:12:12.328
I hate your stories.

1:12:13.287 --> 1:12:18.208
I don't feel an explosion
of happiness when I see you

1:12:19.376 --> 1:12:20.794
and I don't feel more alive.

1:12:20.878 --> 1:12:23.630
-I feel like I don't know you.
-I feel like I don't know you.

1:12:24.757 --> 1:12:26.842
-Exactly.
-And I don't want to.

1:12:26.925 --> 1:12:27.760
Me neither.

1:12:30.220 --> 1:12:31.347
We feel the same.

1:12:39.480 --> 1:12:40.314
Now what?

1:12:41.148 --> 1:12:43.108
What do we do with the party outside?

1:12:43.192 --> 1:12:44.109
I'll handle it.

1:12:44.902 --> 1:12:45.944
I'll handle it.

1:12:46.028 --> 1:12:47.571
It's going to be a disaster.

1:12:51.283 --> 1:12:53.035
How much longer do we have to wait?

1:12:53.869 --> 1:12:55.537
It's a lot, right?

1:13:08.175 --> 1:13:09.176
Lucy, where are you?

1:13:11.720 --> 1:13:13.138
Don't look at me like that.

1:13:13.222 --> 1:13:16.433
Hey, isn't it getting late?

1:13:18.310 --> 1:13:19.311
What's going on?

1:13:19.395 --> 1:13:21.480
People are saying the wedding's canceled.

1:13:22.272 --> 1:13:23.399
Get me out of here.

1:13:24.441 --> 1:13:25.275
Come.

1:13:25.359 --> 1:13:26.318
No.

1:13:26.402 --> 1:13:27.444
There's no one here.

1:13:27.528 --> 1:13:28.445
-Sure?
-Yes.

1:13:28.987 --> 1:13:30.030
Okay.

1:13:30.948 --> 1:13:31.782
Okay.

1:13:34.076 --> 1:13:34.910
Help.

1:13:35.411 --> 1:13:36.245
Okay.

1:13:36.328 --> 1:13:37.830
-Let's go over there.
-Okay.

1:13:39.665 --> 1:13:42.126
Now, can you tell me
what the fuck is happening?

1:13:42.876 --> 1:13:43.961
Bye, wedding,

1:13:44.044 --> 1:13:47.005
bye, Aarón, and bye to this fucking sleeve
that I'm sick of.

1:13:47.548 --> 1:13:49.091
What are you talking about?

1:13:49.174 --> 1:13:50.342
Sara.

1:13:50.426 --> 1:13:52.886
I've seen how you look at each other.
Aarón and you.

1:13:53.470 --> 1:13:55.639
No. Nothing ever happened
between Aarón and I.

1:13:55.722 --> 1:13:57.724
I know. You don't even need to say it.

1:13:58.225 --> 1:14:00.602
This has nothing to do with that.

1:14:01.603 --> 1:14:04.314
Sari, I know damn well that Aarón's songs

1:14:04.398 --> 1:14:07.025
aren't about some Hungarian or Ukrainian.
They're for you.

1:14:09.361 --> 1:14:10.863
Lucy, I don't understand.

1:14:10.946 --> 1:14:11.780
Sister.

1:14:12.364 --> 1:14:15.492
I've just had a breakup
and I feel like a weight's been lifted.

1:14:16.743 --> 1:14:19.204
It's obvious that I'm in love
with the idea of Aarón,

1:14:19.288 --> 1:14:20.914
but I'm not in love with Aarón.

1:14:26.086 --> 1:14:28.338
I swear I've always dreamed of your luck.

1:14:29.256 --> 1:14:30.215
What?

1:14:30.299 --> 1:14:31.133
My luck?

1:14:31.884 --> 1:14:34.052
Don't mess with me, Lucy. What luck?

1:14:34.136 --> 1:14:35.471
-Now what?
-Come on.

1:14:35.554 --> 1:14:37.181
You want my luck?

1:14:37.764 --> 1:14:38.599
Yes.

1:14:39.099 --> 1:14:41.185
But you cursed me all those years ago.

1:14:42.895 --> 1:14:43.729
Lucy,

1:14:44.229 --> 1:14:46.356
I've had bad karma since you did.

1:14:46.440 --> 1:14:47.274
Whoa, wait.

1:14:48.400 --> 1:14:49.276
What did I do?

1:14:50.694 --> 1:14:52.613
With the cake, Lucy. Come on.

1:14:53.947 --> 1:14:54.781
What cake?

1:14:56.366 --> 1:14:57.201
Lucy.

1:14:57.701 --> 1:14:59.119
On one of your birthdays,

1:14:59.203 --> 1:15:01.163
I blew out the candles on your cake

1:15:01.246 --> 1:15:02.581
and you were furious.

1:15:03.123 --> 1:15:05.834
You told me you'd take all my wishes

1:15:05.918 --> 1:15:07.419
from that moment on,

1:15:07.503 --> 1:15:08.337
forever.

1:15:09.671 --> 1:15:10.714
Is this a joke?

1:15:13.550 --> 1:15:15.177
Sara, I was five.

1:15:15.260 --> 1:15:16.261
Come on!

1:15:17.471 --> 1:15:19.348
Your manifestation ability is great!

1:15:19.431 --> 1:15:20.891
-So powerful.
-No. Listen.

1:15:22.476 --> 1:15:26.396
All I've wanted
for you my entire life is good things.

1:15:28.273 --> 1:15:29.358
Truly.

1:15:31.443 --> 1:15:34.530
The only person who placed
that curse is you, Sara.

1:15:35.447 --> 1:15:36.281
You!

1:15:37.533 --> 1:15:38.367
Me?

1:15:46.542 --> 1:15:49.836
I'm sorry for pulling your hair

1:15:49.920 --> 1:15:52.422
and shoving cake in your face.

1:15:53.507 --> 1:15:56.093
I give you all my wishes.

1:16:06.061 --> 1:16:09.982
So you're saying,
I've inflicted this curse upon myself.

1:16:12.526 --> 1:16:15.028
You and your decisions.

1:16:19.491 --> 1:16:21.410
So you don't think I've got bad karma?

1:16:22.619 --> 1:16:23.579
Of course not.

1:16:29.126 --> 1:16:30.919
No. I'm a big idiot, right?

1:16:31.003 --> 1:16:32.212
No, you're not an idiot.

1:16:34.047 --> 1:16:35.966
And if I've dreamed of your luck it's…

1:16:37.759 --> 1:16:39.219
because you're fucking cool.

1:16:41.013 --> 1:16:42.347
You're talented,

1:16:42.973 --> 1:16:44.224
you're fun.

1:16:45.726 --> 1:16:46.852
You're brave.

1:16:48.729 --> 1:16:49.563
Brave?

1:16:53.525 --> 1:16:54.359
Go.

1:16:58.530 --> 1:16:59.364
Go?

1:17:18.508 --> 1:17:21.136
I promise you

1:17:23.388 --> 1:17:27.392
Under the truth of the sun

1:17:28.560 --> 1:17:32.564
We'll go to the top

1:17:32.648 --> 1:17:36.735
Of your favorite cloud

1:17:36.818 --> 1:17:38.695
And from there

1:17:38.779 --> 1:17:39.613
Wait.

1:17:40.238 --> 1:17:44.576
Our house will be in the sky

1:17:45.160 --> 1:17:51.833
We'll hang a sign
Outside the door

1:17:52.709 --> 1:17:54.711
"Please,

1:17:57.005 --> 1:18:00.634
Do not disturb

1:18:02.094 --> 1:18:06.640
We're living a dream"

1:18:12.938 --> 1:18:14.189
I have to go.

1:18:14.272 --> 1:18:15.107
Where?

1:18:16.233 --> 1:18:19.611
But we'll have plenty of time to talk,
you and I. Okay?

1:18:32.332 --> 1:18:33.250
Ready?

1:18:33.333 --> 1:18:34.918
-Ready.
-Okay. Let's go.

1:18:35.001 --> 1:18:35.836
Hey.

1:18:37.045 --> 1:18:38.171
What did you wish for?

1:18:39.214 --> 1:18:41.925
When you blew out the candles on my cake.
What did you wish?

1:18:42.426 --> 1:18:43.510
Ah.

1:18:43.593 --> 1:18:44.803
To go to Reino Aventura.

1:18:45.679 --> 1:18:46.513
Let's go.

1:18:47.597 --> 1:18:49.766
Lucy, Reino Aventura
doesn't exist anymore.

1:18:50.600 --> 1:18:53.478
Plus, the main thing I wanted
was to say goodbye to Keiko.

1:18:54.396 --> 1:18:56.398
Okay, well let's find the whale.

1:18:57.733 --> 1:18:58.775
Keiko already died.

1:18:58.859 --> 1:18:59.776
Ah, that sucks!

1:19:01.361 --> 1:19:03.822
No, okay, so, let's find another whale.

1:19:03.905 --> 1:19:07.117
It doesn't matter if it's not Keiko.
The fun's in fulfilling the wish.

1:19:08.243 --> 1:19:09.369
-Really?
-Yes.

1:19:10.328 --> 1:19:11.246
-Okay.
-Shall we?

1:19:11.329 --> 1:19:13.331
-Yes! I want to see whales.
-Let's go.

1:19:13.415 --> 1:19:14.249
Wait.

1:19:33.018 --> 1:19:36.855
Welcome, friends and family,
to this ceremony.

1:19:37.481 --> 1:19:39.941
Someone has to get married today.

1:19:40.025 --> 1:19:43.862
And the people standing here
have decided to renew their vows.

1:19:57.250 --> 1:19:58.543
Thank you.

1:20:03.131 --> 1:20:07.177
I know what I've always wanted to be

1:20:08.345 --> 1:20:10.722
All I want to do

1:20:10.806 --> 1:20:14.267
Is dance forever

1:20:14.351 --> 1:20:16.937
With you until morning comes

1:20:17.729 --> 1:20:20.232
What I've always wanted to be

1:20:20.941 --> 1:20:23.151
All I want to do

1:20:23.652 --> 1:20:26.655
Is dance forever

1:20:27.155 --> 1:20:29.699
With you until morning comes

1:20:30.450 --> 1:20:32.828
What I've always wanted to be

1:20:33.620 --> 1:20:35.831
All I want to do

1:20:36.456 --> 1:20:39.459
Is dance forever

1:20:40.001 --> 1:20:42.379
With you until morning comes

1:20:42.462 --> 1:20:44.422
And where have we hidden

1:20:44.965 --> 1:20:47.884
All of those dreams we had as children?

1:20:47.968 --> 1:20:49.302
They never took off

1:20:49.386 --> 1:20:52.055
They never left the nest

1:20:54.558 --> 1:20:57.477
All those fugitive dreams

1:20:57.561 --> 1:21:00.730
Left in the dust like a sports car

1:21:00.814 --> 1:21:04.693
Flying into the sky
All those missed shots

1:21:07.153 --> 1:21:09.990
I want to go out that evening
And make a miracle happen

1:21:10.532 --> 1:21:13.368
I want to pluck a star from the sky
To light my cigarette with

1:21:13.451 --> 1:21:16.913
Turn the world in my hand
Like it were a basketball

1:21:16.997 --> 1:21:19.708
I want to keep your smile in my mind
Like when you had braces

1:21:19.791 --> 1:21:24.170
I know what I've always wanted to be

1:21:24.754 --> 1:21:27.299
All I want to do

1:21:27.382 --> 1:21:30.427
Is dance without end

1:21:30.969 --> 1:21:33.722
With you until morning comes

1:21:34.431 --> 1:21:36.808
What I've always wanted to be

1:21:37.559 --> 1:21:40.103
All I want to do

1:21:40.186 --> 1:21:43.273
Is dance without end

1:21:43.899 --> 1:21:45.984
With you until morning comes

1:21:46.067 --> 1:21:48.820
I want to go out that evening
And make a miracle happen

1:21:48.904 --> 1:21:51.698
I want to pluck a star from the sky
To light my cigarette with

1:21:51.781 --> 1:21:55.201
Turn the world in my hand
Like it were a basketball

1:21:55.285 --> 1:21:58.371
I want to keep your smile in my mind
Like when you had braces

1:22:08.048 --> 1:22:11.051
Based on the film Don't blame karma
for what happens because you're an idiot

1:22:11.134 --> 1:22:13.261
Based on the novel by the same name
by Laura Norton

1:22:20.101 --> 1:22:22.103
I'm gonna chew you up, girl

1:22:29.194 --> 1:22:30.487
You're my bubblegum

1:22:30.987 --> 1:22:33.865
You're my cinnamon gum

1:22:35.408 --> 1:22:38.203
You're spicy, but delicious

1:22:39.537 --> 1:22:43.583
You're my cinnamon gum, baby

1:22:43.667 --> 1:22:46.962
I won't stop
Until my tongue goes numb

1:22:47.837 --> 1:22:52.300
Here I come, carefully
I'll unwrap you slowly

1:22:52.384 --> 1:22:56.513
I'll remove that red dress
With no doubt, kiss your neck

1:22:56.596 --> 1:23:01.059
Enjoying it like a bear
Sucking your sticky skin

1:23:01.142 --> 1:23:05.605
Heading direct to the sweet spot
Ignoring the danger

1:23:05.689 --> 1:23:08.984
You're my cinnamon gum

1:23:10.235 --> 1:23:13.154
You're spicy, but delicious

1:23:14.698 --> 1:23:18.493
You're my cinnamon gum, baby

1:23:18.576 --> 1:23:21.997
I won't stop
Until my tongue goes numb

1:23:30.296 --> 1:23:31.673
You're my bubblegum

1:24:52.003 --> 1:24:55.673
