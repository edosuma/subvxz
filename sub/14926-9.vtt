WEBVTT

00:04.538 --> 00:06.074
I HATE HIM.

00:06.107 --> 00:06.807
HE IS HORRIBLE.

00:06.840 --> 00:07.941
HE'S A SWINE.

00:07.975 --> 00:11.279
YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU ARE SO MUCH
BETTER OFF WITHOUT HIM.

00:11.312 --> 00:11.912
YEP.

00:11.945 --> 00:13.314
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?
WHAT?

00:13.347 --> 00:14.082
I'M GONNA
WIN HIM BACK.

00:14.115 --> 00:18.186
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT YOU SHOULD DO.

00:18.219 --> 00:19.420
WHOO!

00:19.453 --> 00:21.189
HEY, HEY,
WHOA WHOA WHOA!

00:21.222 --> 00:24.225
THE HOUSE IS ON BASE.

00:25.593 --> 00:27.195
AAH!
AAH!

00:27.228 --> 00:28.562
WHOO!
COME ON,
COME ON!

00:28.596 --> 00:32.700
COME ON,
I CAN TAKE IT.
HEY, WHOA WHOA!

00:32.733 --> 00:35.536
TIME OUT.
WHOA WHOA
WHOA WHOA!

00:36.604 --> 00:39.240
IS THIS
EVEN WATER?

00:44.278 --> 00:46.214
HEY, CLAUD.

00:46.247 --> 00:48.182
HEY, LINA.
HOW'S BRIAN?

00:48.216 --> 00:49.783
HE'S CHEATING ON ME.

00:49.817 --> 00:52.820
UH, HOW'S
YOUR SISTER?

00:53.221 --> 00:55.189
HE'S SLEEPING
WITH MY SISTER.

00:55.223 --> 00:59.127
OH GOD,
OH, UM...

01:01.629 --> 01:03.531
YOU LOOK GREAT.

01:04.232 --> 01:05.499
LEAVE.

01:05.533 --> 01:07.435
LEAVE!

01:07.468 --> 01:08.736
YOU--GO!

01:08.769 --> 01:11.172
ARE YOU SURE?
I'M VERY.

01:11.205 --> 01:12.806
AND NOW I'M WET?

01:12.840 --> 01:14.542
I--I'M SORRY, HONEY.

01:14.575 --> 01:17.511
Boys:
AAH!

01:17.545 --> 01:27.588
AAH! I SAID
THE HOUSE IS ON BASE!

01:27.588 --> 01:41.735
AAH! I SAID
THE HOUSE IS ON BASE!

01:41.769 --> 01:43.837
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR
LITTLE WATER FIGHT?

01:43.871 --> 01:45.806
CAN'T HAVE
A WATER FIGHT
IN THE RAIN.

01:45.839 --> 01:47.608
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHO'S WINNING.

01:47.641 --> 01:48.876
DUH.

01:50.778 --> 01:52.746
9. 1, 2, 3--

01:52.780 --> 01:54.415
NO, NO.
THAT'S MINE.

01:54.448 --> 01:55.349
I'M THE CAR.

01:55.383 --> 01:56.217
YOU'RE THE HAT.

01:56.250 --> 01:57.618
I DON'T WANNA
BE THE HAT.

01:57.651 --> 01:58.319
TOUGH.

01:58.352 --> 01:59.687
BUT IT DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE.

01:59.720 --> 02:02.656
WHY WOULD A HAT
BUY A HOTEL?

02:02.690 --> 02:04.692
WELL, WHY WOULD
A WHEELBARROW

02:04.725 --> 02:05.593
GO TO JAIL?

02:05.626 --> 02:08.762
OK? SO DON'T
OVERTHINK IT.

02:12.333 --> 02:14.802
MONOPOLY.
ALL RIGHT.

02:16.204 --> 02:17.738
YOU WANT US
TO DEAL YOU IN?

02:17.771 --> 02:18.739
ABSOLUTELY.

02:18.772 --> 02:19.707
OH--OH. WE LOST

02:19.740 --> 02:20.608
ALL THE OTHER
GAME TOKENS.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.676
THAT'S
ALL RIGHT, JIMMY.
I'LL BE THE GUM.

02:22.710 --> 02:23.577
UH-UH.

02:23.611 --> 02:24.712
NO, NO.
DON'T BE GUM.

02:24.745 --> 02:27.448
RELAX. I'LL PUT
IT ON A PENNY.

02:27.481 --> 02:28.582
ROLL FOR ME.

02:28.616 --> 02:29.483
I'M GONNA
GO GRAB A BEER.

02:29.517 --> 02:32.720
OH, WHOA. NO, NO.
DON'T GO IN THERE, MAN.

02:32.753 --> 02:33.787
WHY?

02:33.821 --> 02:35.723
'CAUSE THERE'S, YOU KNOW,
THERE'S LIKE A SITUATION.

02:35.756 --> 02:37.858
SOMEBODY PUKE?

02:38.959 --> 02:39.760
NOT YET.

02:39.793 --> 02:40.694
HOW'S SHE DOIN'?

02:40.728 --> 02:42.430
OH, SHE IS
A WHIMPERING PUDDLE

02:42.463 --> 02:45.699
OF BITTERNESS
AND SELF-LOATHING.

02:45.733 --> 02:46.967
CAN I COME
LISTEN?

02:47.000 --> 02:47.868
YOU WOULDN'T
LIKE IT, HONEY.

02:47.901 --> 02:48.802
THAT'S WHAT YOU
SAY WHEN YOU
CAN'T THINK

02:48.836 --> 02:51.772
OF A REAL REASON
FOR ME NOT
TO DO SOMETHING.

02:51.805 --> 02:52.840
YOU GOT IT.

02:52.873 --> 02:55.543
HONEY, WHY IS IT
THAT AN INCREDIBLE
WOMAN LIKE LINA

02:55.576 --> 02:57.511
CANNOT FIND
ONE DECENT GUY, HUH?

02:57.545 --> 02:58.546
LINA?

02:58.579 --> 02:59.680
OH, NO.

02:59.713 --> 03:01.415
LINA.
NO, NO.

03:01.449 --> 03:03.451
IS SHE THE ONE
WITH THE FAT SISTER,

03:03.484 --> 03:05.886
OR IS SHE
THE FAT SISTER?

03:06.887 --> 03:08.622
HER SISTER'S
NOT THAT FAT.

03:08.656 --> 03:09.623
OH, SO LINA'S
THE HOT ONE.

03:09.657 --> 03:11.292
YOU GOT
A MINT, ANYBODY?
I--

03:11.325 --> 03:12.260
SEAN, PLEASE.
YOU--

03:12.293 --> 03:13.060
YOU ARE NOT
GOIN' IN THERE.

03:13.093 --> 03:15.263
YEAH, NO. YOU GO IN
AND TALK ME UP--

03:15.296 --> 03:15.929
NO!

03:15.963 --> 03:16.830
SEAN, THIS IS
YOUR BROTHER.

03:16.864 --> 03:18.699
YEAH, THAT'S
THE POINT, DAD.

03:18.732 --> 03:20.268
SO, IT'D KILL YA
TO PUT IN A GOOD WORD

03:20.301 --> 03:21.101
FOR YOUR OWN BROTHER?

03:21.134 --> 03:22.470
I'VE PUT IN GOOD WORDS
FOR HIM BEFORE,

03:22.503 --> 03:24.372
AND IT ALWAYS
BITES ME IN THE ASS.

03:24.405 --> 03:26.006
WHOA. EXCUSE ME,
MR. PENNIX.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.375
MR. PENNIX.

03:27.408 --> 03:28.276
FINNERTY.

03:28.309 --> 03:30.578
THIS IS, UH, MY BROTHER
I TOLD YOU ABOUT.

03:30.611 --> 03:31.812
FOR THE JOB?

03:31.845 --> 03:32.680
AND YOU'LL
VOUCH FOR HIM?

03:32.713 --> 03:34.715
ABSOLUTELY, SIR.
HE'S A REAL TEAM PLAYER.

03:34.748 --> 03:36.016
HE'S WILLING TO START
FROM THE BOTTOM,

03:36.049 --> 03:37.385
WORK HIS WAY UP.

03:37.418 --> 03:39.019
WHAT?

03:39.052 --> 03:40.521
ALL RIGHT.
I GOT AN OPENING

03:40.554 --> 03:42.723
FOR A LINE
INSPECTOR
ON THE 4-5-6.

03:42.756 --> 03:43.757
YOU START
ON MONDAY.

03:43.791 --> 03:44.992
WHOA, WHOA.
SIR, A LINE INSPECTOR.

03:45.025 --> 03:46.560
COME ON. THAT'S
BETTER THAN MY JOB.

03:46.594 --> 03:47.761
I'VE BEEN HERE
FOR YEARS.

03:47.795 --> 03:48.829
YOU'RE
TOO VALUABLE

03:48.862 --> 03:49.897
TO ME DOWN HERE,
FINNERTY.

03:49.930 --> 03:54.835
MR.--MR. PENNIX!
LINE INSPECTORS
DON'T DO ANYTHING!

03:54.868 --> 03:56.337
SWEET.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.806
I DIDN'T KNOW EDDIE
WORKED IN THE SUBWAY.

03:58.839 --> 04:00.808
A DAY AND A HALF.

04:00.841 --> 04:02.843
I COULDN'T DEAL
WITH THE HAT, MAN.

04:02.876 --> 04:06.680
IT WAS LIKE PUSHIN'
DOWN ON MY HAIR
AND EVERYTHING.

04:06.714 --> 04:07.448
HOW COULD YOU
VOUCH FOR THAT

04:07.481 --> 04:09.417
CAT-CHUCKING
BATH MAT,
FINNERTY?!

04:09.450 --> 04:11.352
WHAT, HAVE YOU
GOT YOUR HEAD
UP YOUR HATCH?!

04:11.385 --> 04:13.821
THAT BROTHER
OF YOURS IS
A NO-GOOD

04:13.854 --> 04:16.357
FRY-EATIN'
PUDDLE MUGGER!

04:16.390 --> 04:19.693
I JUST WASN'T MADE
TO WORK IN YOUR
9-TO-5 WORLD.

04:19.727 --> 04:22.896
OH, REALLY. 'CAUSE I LOVE
SPENDIN' 10 HOURS A DAY

04:22.930 --> 04:23.931
IN A RAT-INFESTED TUNNEL.

04:23.964 --> 04:24.765
THAT'S WHAT
I'M SAYIN'.

04:24.798 --> 04:28.536
EDDIE'S SENSITIVE.
HE'LL FIND HIS WAY.

04:28.569 --> 04:29.703
OH, NO, NO.

04:29.737 --> 04:32.740
EVER SINCE WE WERE
KIDS, YOU'VE ALWAYS
SIDED WITH EDDIE.

04:32.773 --> 04:36.009
THE FORCE
IS WITH ME.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.712
AH, QUIT IT!

04:39.547 --> 04:41.882
DAD, SEAN TOOK
MY STICK.

04:41.915 --> 04:43.617
SEAN, GIVE YOUR
BROTHER HIS STICK.

04:43.651 --> 04:45.386
BUT HE KEEPS
HITTING ME WITH IT.

04:45.419 --> 04:46.520
HE DOESN'T
KNOW ANY BETTER.

04:46.554 --> 04:48.456
NOW GIVE HIM
HIS STICK.

04:49.457 --> 04:50.524
DON'T HIT ME.

04:50.558 --> 04:52.426
I WON'T.

04:53.727 --> 04:55.796
AAH! DAD!

04:55.829 --> 04:57.698
NOBODY LIKES
A WHINER, SEAN.

04:57.731 --> 04:59.700
YOU HAVE ALWAYS
TAKEN HIS SIDE.

04:59.733 --> 05:02.336
WHAT DID I SAY
ABOUT THE WHINING?

05:02.536 --> 05:05.806
DAD, HENRY
PUT THE DICE
IN HIS MOUTH.

05:05.839 --> 05:06.607
IT'S FOR LUCK.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.976
COME ON. COME ON,
HENRY. ROLL. ROLL.

05:09.009 --> 05:12.346
SNAKE EYES.
I ROLL AGAIN.

05:13.981 --> 05:16.550
AH, GREAT. THERE GO
THE MARGARITAS.

05:16.584 --> 05:17.885
SEE, NOW WOULD BE
A PERFECT TIME

05:17.918 --> 05:18.719
TO GO IN THERE
AND TALK ME UP.

05:18.752 --> 05:20.521
SEE, I THOUGHT I'D
BEEN CLEAR ON THIS.

05:20.554 --> 05:21.922
I'M NOT GONNA
GO DO THAT.
WHY NOT?

05:21.955 --> 05:23.924
BECAUSE I'VE TALKED YOU
UP TO WOMEN BEFORE--

05:23.957 --> 05:27.561
MANY TIMES--AND IT
ALWAYS TURNS INTO
A NIGHTMARE.

05:27.595 --> 05:28.662
HE'S A GREAT GUY.

05:28.696 --> 05:29.329
VERY FUNNY.

05:29.363 --> 05:31.899
HE'S GOT A LOT
OF POTENTIAL.

05:31.932 --> 05:33.000
IS HE WEIRD?

05:33.033 --> 05:33.734
WEIRD NO.

05:33.767 --> 05:36.837
EDDIE'S NOT WEIRD.
CLAUDIA...HE--

05:36.870 --> 05:37.838
HE'S INTERESTING.

05:37.871 --> 05:38.906
Sean: INTERESTING.

05:38.939 --> 05:39.673
Claudia: YEAH.

05:39.707 --> 05:41.442
NOW WHEN WE GET UP
TO THE DOORMAN,

05:41.475 --> 05:43.010
IT WOULDN'T HURT
TO SHOW A LITTLE SKIN.

05:43.043 --> 05:44.778
BUT I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU KNOW THE GUY.

05:44.812 --> 05:47.014
I KNOW THE GUY, BUT I KNOW
HE LIKES A LITTLE SKIN.

05:47.047 --> 05:49.883
OK, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST SLIP HIM
SOME MONEY?

05:49.917 --> 05:51.118
I HAVE TO EARN MONEY.

05:51.151 --> 05:54.021
HER SKIN IS SOMETHING
SHE ALREADY HAS.

05:54.054 --> 05:56.657
IT'S RENEWABLE.
IT'S LIKE SOLAR POWER.

05:56.690 --> 05:59.026
I THINK PERVERT
IS A LITTLE UNFAIR.

05:59.059 --> 06:01.161
I WANT
MY CROCK-POT BACK.

06:01.194 --> 06:03.931
Sean: AND THEN
THERE WAS FAYE.

06:03.964 --> 06:06.800
YEAH, CLAUDIA.
IT WENT WELL.

06:06.834 --> 06:08.969
ACTUALLY, IT'S
STILL GOING WELL.

06:09.002 --> 06:13.140
FAYE, WHERE'D YOU GET THESE
OLIVES? THEY'RE DELISH.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.944
ARE YOU WEARING
MY BLOUSE?

06:17.177 --> 06:18.946
I WAS COLD.

06:19.980 --> 06:21.949
WHAT? YOU'RE
WEARING MINE.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.917
Sean: FAYE, FAYE,
I'M SORRY.

06:23.951 --> 06:26.654
FAYE, PLEASE.
I HOPE THIS DOESN'T
COME BETWEEN US.

06:26.687 --> 06:28.456
I MEAN, YOU ARE
JIMMY'S GODMOTHER.

06:28.489 --> 06:30.924
LET EDDIE BE
HIS GODMOTHER.

06:30.958 --> 06:32.993
Sean: AND THEN
THERE WAS MARGOT.

06:33.026 --> 06:35.062
UH, I'LL HAVE
THE SCUNGILLI,

06:35.095 --> 06:37.765
AND THE LADY WILL HAVE
LINGUINE WITH CLAMS.

06:37.798 --> 06:38.799
OH, NO. I CAN'T.

06:38.832 --> 06:40.601
YES, YOU CAN. SHE'LL HAVE
THE LINGUINE WITH CLAMS.

06:40.634 --> 06:43.604
UH, NO, NO.
I'M ALLERGIC TO CLAMS.
I'LL DIE.

06:43.637 --> 06:46.039
NO, NO.
THEY'RE REALLY GOOD.
TRUST ME.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.041
Eddie: I'LL CALL YA.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.042
WHEN?

06:49.076 --> 06:51.912
DON'T SMOTHER ME.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.782
LOOK, IT'S NOT
EDDIE'S FAULT.

06:54.815 --> 06:57.217
HE'S ALWAYS HAD TO BAT
WOMEN OFF WITH A STICK.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.051
DO WOMEN LIKE THAT?

06:58.085 --> 07:01.522
JUST KEEP YOUR HEAD
IN THE GAME, SON.

07:02.623 --> 07:03.524
WHO IS IT?

07:03.557 --> 07:06.494
UH, IT'S SOME GUY
TRYIN' TO GIVE ME
A JOB.

07:06.527 --> 07:07.227
DELETE.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.962
WHY DON'T YOU
PUT IT ON VIBRATE?

07:08.996 --> 07:10.063
GOOD IDEA.

07:10.097 --> 07:11.064
WHAT'S VIBRATE?

07:11.098 --> 07:12.966
VIBRATE IS THIS.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.101
THAT TICKLES.

07:14.134 --> 07:15.669
...SHAVE.

07:15.703 --> 07:16.336
COME ON!

07:16.369 --> 07:18.872
HEY, YOUR BUTT'S
KINDA HAIRY.

07:18.906 --> 07:20.073
I'M GOIN' INTO
THE KITCHEN.

07:20.107 --> 07:21.041
ANYBODY
WANT ANYTHING?

07:21.074 --> 07:23.611
YEAH, I'D LIKE YOU NOT
TO GO INTO THE KITCHEN,

07:23.644 --> 07:24.545
AS INSTRUCTED.

07:24.578 --> 07:25.679
AND GET ME A BEER.

07:25.713 --> 07:26.547
I GOT IT.

07:26.580 --> 07:28.516
THIS ONE TIME, RIGHT
IN THE MIDDLE OF IT,

07:28.549 --> 07:32.152
HE ASKED IF HE
COULD CALL ME MOMMY.

07:32.185 --> 07:33.253
I MEAN, SICK!

07:33.286 --> 07:35.255
I MEAN, THE TIME HE
WAS PRANCING AROUND

07:35.288 --> 07:36.557
IN MY UNDERWEAR
WAS BAD ENOUGH,

07:36.590 --> 07:37.791
BUT DID YOU EVER
IN YOUR LIFE--

07:37.825 --> 07:40.160
STOP.
HI, LILY.

07:40.193 --> 07:41.028
HI, MOM. HI, LINA.

07:41.061 --> 07:42.162
WHAT ARE YOU
DOIN', HONEY?

07:42.195 --> 07:44.932
NOTHING. JUST PRETEND
I'M NOT EVEN HERE.

07:44.965 --> 07:45.999
SO ANYWAY,

07:46.033 --> 07:48.869
THE NEXT MORNING
I FIND HIM CURLED UP
ON THE COUCH,

07:48.902 --> 07:52.272
IN THE FETAL
POSITION,
WEEPING, NAKED--

07:52.305 --> 07:54.041
HOW LONG YOU GONNA BE?

07:54.074 --> 07:57.545
NOT LONG. I'M JUST
GETTIN' SOME STUFF

07:57.578 --> 08:00.581
AND...MAKIN' SOME FUDGE.

08:00.614 --> 08:02.850
REALLY?

08:02.883 --> 08:05.052
AND, UM, WHAT DO YOU
MAKE FUDGE WITH?

08:05.085 --> 08:07.955
UM...MAYONNAISE?

08:07.988 --> 08:09.489
GET OUT.

08:10.891 --> 08:12.225
ALL RIGHT, HENRY.
I'M GONNA TRADE YOU

08:12.259 --> 08:15.195
PACIFIC AVENUE
FOR ST. JAMES PLACE.

08:15.228 --> 08:16.296
BUT I LIKE THE ORANGES.

08:16.329 --> 08:19.567
SURE, SURE.
BUT YOU GOT 2 GREENS
AND ONLY ONE ORANGE,

08:19.600 --> 08:23.203
AND IF YOU GET
PACIFIC AVENUE,
YOU'LL HAVE WHAT?

08:23.236 --> 08:24.104
NO ORANGES.

08:24.137 --> 08:27.174
TRUE. TRUE.
OK, BUT YOU'LL
ALSO HAVE A...

08:27.207 --> 08:28.108
LACK OF ORANGES.

08:28.141 --> 08:31.545
NO, NO. YOU'LL
HAVE A MONOPOLY!
A MONOPOLY!

08:31.579 --> 08:33.146
YOU WANT THAT.
IT'S GOOD.

08:33.180 --> 08:33.981
DON'T DO IT.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.148
DAD, STAY OUT OF THIS.

08:35.182 --> 08:36.850
IT'S A BUM DEAL.

08:36.884 --> 08:39.653
YOU LIKE TRAINS,
DON'T YA, HENRY?

08:39.687 --> 08:40.721
YEAH.

08:40.754 --> 08:43.090
WELL, THEN GIVE ME ALL
OF THOSE PURPLES AND YELLOWS,

08:43.123 --> 08:47.127
AND I'LL GIVE YOU
THE B&O RAILROAD.

08:47.160 --> 08:49.329
NO, NO.
IT'S A RIPOFF! NO!

08:49.362 --> 08:51.098
WHOO WHOO!

08:51.131 --> 08:53.200
Sean: OH, COME ON.

08:53.233 --> 08:54.067
YO, WHERE'S
MY BEER?

08:54.101 --> 08:56.236
THEY DRANK
'EM ALL.

08:56.804 --> 08:59.873
MAN, LINA IS SO
DESPERATE AND NEEDY.

08:59.907 --> 09:01.174
OH, SEANY,
YOU'RE
KILLIN' ME.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.743
YOU GOTTA
GET ME AN IN.

09:02.776 --> 09:03.611
NOPE.

09:03.644 --> 09:06.313
BUT DESPERATE
WOMEN LOVE ME.

09:06.346 --> 09:08.315
YOU SEE, I WOULD IF
YOU COULD NAME

09:08.348 --> 09:09.717
ONE WOMAN I HOOKED
YOU UP WITH

09:09.750 --> 09:13.654
THAT DIDN'T
TURN INTO
A TOTAL CATASTROPHE.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.169
WHAT ABOUT ABBY?

09:29.202 --> 09:30.971
ABBY?

09:31.004 --> 09:32.072
ABBY?!
ABBY.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.073
ABBY!
ABIGAIL.

09:33.106 --> 09:34.942
WE'RE TALKIN'
ABOUT ABBY.
ABBY.

09:34.975 --> 09:36.777
WHO'S ABBY?!

09:40.714 --> 09:44.117
ABBY SELLS
RESTAURANT SUPPLIES.

09:44.151 --> 09:47.154
OH, AND, UH, EDDIE
EATS AT RESTAURANTS
ALL THE TIME,

09:47.187 --> 09:51.324
AND HE'S ALWAYS
COMMENTING ON
THE SUPPLIES, RIGHT?

09:51.358 --> 09:53.193
RIGHT.

09:54.662 --> 09:57.030
WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKIN' AT?

09:57.364 --> 10:00.868
YOU GOT SOME CRUD
IN THE CORNER
OF YOUR EYE.

10:04.204 --> 10:05.906
GOT IT.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.208
MAKE A WISH.

10:11.278 --> 10:12.212
YOU GET YOUR WISH?

10:12.245 --> 10:15.382
UH, YOU STILL

10:16.316 --> 10:18.185
WHO SAYS I WAS?

10:18.218 --> 10:19.352
CHECK, PLEASE.

10:19.386 --> 10:21.989
CHECK, PLEASE.
UH, CHECK.

10:22.389 --> 10:25.425
ACTUALLY, HE CAME
BACK TO MY PLACE.

10:25.458 --> 10:28.796
YEAH,
AND HE'S STILL HERE.

10:28.829 --> 10:32.165
OH, I GOTTA GO.
I'LL CALL YOU LATER.
OK, BYE.

10:37.137 --> 10:41.174
HEY, IS THAT
MY SHIRT?

10:42.776 --> 10:45.746
LOOKIN' GOOD.

10:46.179 --> 10:49.750
GIVE MAMA SOME OF
THAT SWEET STUFF.

10:52.419 --> 10:54.888
THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE HOLDING UP
AS AN EXAMPLE?

10:54.922 --> 10:55.989
HEY, WE WENT OUT
FOR 2 MONTHS.

10:56.023 --> 10:58.992
OH, YEAH.
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED
AFTER THE 2 MONTHS?

10:59.026 --> 10:59.860
AH, COME ON, SEAN.

10:59.893 --> 11:01.328
WHAT'S THE HARM
IN LETTIN' YOUR BROTHER

11:01.361 --> 11:03.263
HAVE A CRACK AT THE LUSH
IN THE KITCHEN?

11:03.296 --> 11:04.965
NO. NO WAY. UH-UH.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.299
OK. I'M GONNA
GO BY MYSELF.

11:06.333 --> 11:07.334
NO, YOU'RE NOT.
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

11:07.367 --> 11:08.335
WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOIN'?
IN THE KITCHEN.

11:08.368 --> 11:10.771
UH-UH. OH, NO.
'CAUSE IF YOU GO
IN THE KITCHEN,

11:10.804 --> 11:12.139
YOU'RE DEAD.
I GOT YOU!

11:12.172 --> 11:12.973
SORRY!

11:13.006 --> 11:15.308
COME ON! COME ON!
WHAT ARE
YOU DOIN'?

11:15.342 --> 11:16.209
COME ON, EDDIE!

11:16.243 --> 11:16.910
LOOK OUT!
OH, LOOK OUT!

11:16.944 --> 11:18.411
EDDIE'S HITTIN'
HIMSELF, DAD.

11:18.445 --> 11:19.913
EDDIE'S HITTIN' HIMSELF.

11:19.947 --> 11:21.181
COME ON! COME ON!

11:21.214 --> 11:23.083
AHH.
OH.

11:26.119 --> 11:27.020
LOOK WHAT YOU DID.

11:27.054 --> 11:28.121
NAW, I DIDN'T
DO THAT.

11:28.155 --> 11:29.122
SHIRT COST 80 BUCKS.

11:29.156 --> 11:31.058
SHUT UP,
THE BOTH OF YA!

11:31.091 --> 11:31.658
HEY, HEY, HEY!

11:31.691 --> 11:32.659
HE SAID I TORE
HIS SHIRT.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.295
I DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU'RE MAKING
SUCH A BIG DEAL

11:35.328 --> 11:36.196
ABOUT THIS,
SEAN.

11:36.229 --> 11:37.130
DAD, IF YOU KNEW
WHAT HAPPENED
WITH ABBY,

11:37.164 --> 11:40.467
YOU WOULDN'T WANT HIM
GOING IN THAT KITCHEN.

11:40.500 --> 11:41.869
WHY,
WHAT HAPPENED?

11:41.902 --> 11:43.036
WE DON'T NEED
TO GO INTO THIS.
TELL ME!

11:43.070 --> 11:47.240
LEFT-HANDED.
EYES CLOSED.
NOTHIN' BUT NET.

11:48.141 --> 11:49.877
SO, ABBY,
SHE'S TERRIFIC.

11:49.910 --> 11:50.911
ISN'T SHE GREAT?

11:50.944 --> 11:53.313
YEAH. YOU DON'T MEET
PEOPLE LIKE THAT
EVERY DAY...

11:53.346 --> 11:56.483
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE
WHO CAN STAND YOU.

11:58.085 --> 12:01.488
YEAH. SHE'S ONE
IN A MILLION.

12:02.155 --> 12:04.024
MAN, I GOTTA
GET RID OF HER.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.326
SO WHY
WOULD YOU WANT
TO GET RID OF HER

12:06.359 --> 12:07.828
IF IT WAS GOIN'
SO WELL?

12:07.861 --> 12:08.528
BECAUSE HE'S EDDIE.

12:08.561 --> 12:10.764
HEY, I HAD
MY REASONS.

12:10.798 --> 12:12.833
IT'S FREAKIN' ME OUT,
MAN.

12:12.866 --> 12:14.802
I SEE HER ALMOST
EVERY DAY.

12:14.835 --> 12:16.103
WHEN I DON'T SEE HER,

12:16.136 --> 12:17.838
I TALK TO HER
ON THE PHONE.

12:17.871 --> 12:19.172
SO SHE CALLS YOU.
SO WHAT?

12:19.206 --> 12:21.809
NO, YOU AREN'T
LISTENING TO ME,
MAN.

12:21.842 --> 12:23.777
I CALL HER.

12:25.345 --> 12:27.447
HEY. HEY,
DON'T FREAK OUT.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.182
COME ON,
ACCEPT IT.

12:29.216 --> 12:31.184
YOU'RE IN
A RELATIONSHIP.

12:31.218 --> 12:32.385
EXCUSE ME?

12:32.419 --> 12:33.186
A RELATIONSHIP.

12:33.220 --> 12:35.188
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS?

12:35.222 --> 12:38.158
YOU'VE BEEN SLEEPING
WITH THE SAME WOMAN
SINCE 1986.

12:38.191 --> 12:39.893
YEAH. WE'RE MARRIED.

12:39.927 --> 12:41.061
IT'S A RUT.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.831
LOOK, EITHER ACCEPT
THIS THING OR END IT,

12:43.864 --> 12:46.166
AND IF YOU'RE
GONNA END IT...HEY...

12:46.199 --> 12:47.400
BE A MAN ABOUT IT.

12:47.434 --> 12:49.837
MAKE A CLEAN BREAK.

12:49.870 --> 12:50.470
YEAH.

12:50.503 --> 12:53.206
I GOTTA DO
THE RIGHT THING.

12:54.407 --> 12:56.309
AH! IT'S NOT
EVEN MY BIRTHDAY!

12:56.343 --> 13:00.313
MY HUSBAND
IS SO SWEET.

13:01.048 --> 13:02.282
"WITH DEEPEST SYMPATHY

13:02.315 --> 13:04.084
IN YOUR TIME OF GRIEF."

13:04.117 --> 13:08.255
IS THAT SUPPOSED
TO MAKE YOU HOT?

13:14.227 --> 13:16.063
"GOOD

13:19.366 --> 13:20.901
HEY, I GOT
A DELI PLATTER HERE

13:20.934 --> 13:23.603
FOR THE FAMILY
OF THE LATE
EDWIN FINNERTY.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.138
WHAT?

13:25.172 --> 13:26.306
IT'S COOL.
I GOT IT.

13:26.339 --> 13:28.241
WHAT'S GOING ON?

13:28.275 --> 13:30.243
HE'S NOT
DEAD.

13:30.277 --> 13:31.144
OH. I'M SORRY.

13:31.178 --> 13:34.247
NO, NO, NO.
GIVE IT HERE.
GIVE IT HERE.

13:34.281 --> 13:37.184
HEY, WE'RE
IN MOURNING.

13:38.518 --> 13:41.188
SALAMI. MAN, THEY DIDN'T
KNOW ME AT ALL!

13:41.221 --> 13:44.124
THEY PROBABLY
DIDN'T THINK
YOU'D BE EATING IT.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.226
I'M NOT FOLLOWING.

13:46.259 --> 13:48.195
HE TOLD ABBY
HE WAS DEAD.

13:48.228 --> 13:49.196
I DID NOT.

13:49.229 --> 13:50.330
IF I TOLD HER
I WAS DEAD,

13:50.363 --> 13:52.299
THEN SHE WOULD KNOW
I WASN'T DEAD.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.234
OK, OK, PARDON ME.
I'M SORRY.

13:54.267 --> 13:56.236
NO, HE HAD HIS BUDDY
KENNY DO IT.

13:56.269 --> 13:59.039
SO KENNY
CALLS HER UP,
AND HE SAYS THAT--

13:59.072 --> 13:59.873
CORRECT ME
IF I'M WRONG--

13:59.907 --> 14:02.142
YOU FELL OFF
THE STATEN ISLAND
FERR--

14:02.175 --> 14:03.076
I WAS PUSHED.

14:03.110 --> 14:05.045
HE WAS PUSHED OFF
THE STATEN ISLAND
FERRY.

14:05.078 --> 14:06.246
THEN HE WAS PULLED--
SUCKED.

14:06.279 --> 14:07.214
SUCKED INTO
THE PROPELLERS,
RIGHT?

14:07.247 --> 14:09.482
THEN HE TELLS HER
THERE'S THIS BIG
COVER-UP,

14:09.516 --> 14:11.885
SO IF SHE
GOES AROUND ASKING
TOO MANY QUESTIONS,

14:11.919 --> 14:14.287
THE FERRY PEOPLE
ARE GONNA
CHASE HER DOWN

14:14.321 --> 14:16.123
AND SHUT HER UP
FOR GOOD.

14:16.156 --> 14:17.324
OOH HOO. HA HA.

14:20.493 --> 14:23.130
I AM SO SORRY
ABOUT EDDIE.

14:23.163 --> 14:25.632
TAKE THESE
TANGELOS.

14:25.665 --> 14:28.235
HE--HE'S NOT DEAD.

14:30.470 --> 14:33.206
IT WILL HELP
IF YOU TALK ABOUT IT.

14:33.240 --> 14:34.307
HE'S NOT DEAD.

14:34.341 --> 14:38.245
ACCEPTANCE WILL COME
IN TIME, MY SON.

14:40.580 --> 14:42.482
HE'S NOT DEAD.

14:42.515 --> 14:44.484
WHAT I'M SAYING IS
HE'S ALIVE.

14:44.517 --> 14:47.520
YES, YOU'RE RIGHT,
VERY MUCH ALIVE...

14:47.554 --> 14:49.889
WITH THE LORD.

14:53.961 --> 14:56.129
HE'S NOT DEAD!

14:56.163 --> 14:57.497
NO, NO!
HE'S ALIVE.

14:57.530 --> 14:58.932
HE ALIVE!

14:58.966 --> 15:00.167
NO, HE'S ALIVE!

15:00.200 --> 15:01.101
YES, HE IS.

15:01.134 --> 15:03.937
RIGHT. I MEAN
HE'S ALIVE,
AS IN NOT DEAD.

15:03.971 --> 15:05.705
HE ALIVE!
NO!

15:05.738 --> 15:07.207
YES!

15:07.240 --> 15:09.609
IN HERE.

15:09.642 --> 15:12.212
YES, HE IS.

15:12.245 --> 15:13.546
AMEN.

15:14.114 --> 15:16.516
WAIT. WAS THIS
ABOUT 4 MONTHS AGO?

15:16.549 --> 15:17.350
UH-HUH.

15:17.384 --> 15:18.685
'CAUSE PEOPLE KEPT
COMING UP AND SAYING

15:18.718 --> 15:22.622
THEY FELT SORRY FOR ME,
BUT I THOUGHT THEY JUST
MEANT IN GENERAL.

15:22.655 --> 15:24.958
ALL RIGHT, SO I TOLD
A LITTLE WHITE LIE

15:24.992 --> 15:27.194
TO SPARE SOMEBODY'S
FEELINGS.

15:27.227 --> 15:28.195
SO WHAT?

15:28.228 --> 15:31.364
NO, YOU LED HER
TO BELIEVE YOU WERE
DECEASED.

15:31.398 --> 15:33.200
WELL, IT SHOWS
A GOOD HEART.

15:33.233 --> 15:34.701
AW, COME ON, DAD!

15:34.734 --> 15:38.305
OK, I'LL GIVE YOU
$1,000 FOR BOARDWALK.

15:38.338 --> 15:39.406
IT'S NOT FOR SALE.

15:39.439 --> 15:40.540
$100,000.

15:40.573 --> 15:44.177
THERE AREN'T EVEN
$100,000 IN MONOPOLY.

15:44.211 --> 15:47.147
$500 AND 2...

15:47.180 --> 15:49.416
REAL DOLLARS.

15:51.718 --> 15:55.155
I CAN LIVE WITH THAT.

15:57.757 --> 15:59.359
OK, WHAT WAS
THAT FOR?

15:59.392 --> 16:02.329
I JUST LOVE
MY SEANY,
THAT'S ALL.

16:02.362 --> 16:03.596
AND I LOVE YOU,
TOO, BABY.

16:03.630 --> 16:04.697
OH, HEY, BABY,
DO ME A FAVOR, OK?

16:04.731 --> 16:08.335
DON'T OPERATE
ANY MORE MACHINERY
TONIGHT, ALL RIGHT?

16:08.368 --> 16:09.702
EVEN THE BLENDER?

16:09.736 --> 16:11.138
ESPECIALLY
THE BLENDER.

16:11.171 --> 16:14.241
HOW SWEET.
HE DOESN'T WANT ME
TO GET MAIMED.

16:14.274 --> 16:15.008
HA HA...

16:15.042 --> 16:16.043
THAT'S RIGHT.
HOW'S LENA

16:16.076 --> 16:19.779
LENA IS A SUPERFINE
CATCH WITH A LOT
TO OFFER...

16:19.812 --> 16:22.049
AND ANY MAN
WHO BREAKS HER HEART

16:22.082 --> 16:24.684
IS NOTHING BUT
A BASTARD MAN!

16:26.453 --> 16:27.654
SET US UP.

16:27.687 --> 16:28.655
HA!

16:28.688 --> 16:29.922
SO THIS WHOLE
FAKING-YOUR-DEATH
THING WORKED?

16:29.956 --> 16:35.595
OF COURSE IT DID.
I MEAN, HOW COULD A PLAN
THAT BRILLIANT FAIL?

16:35.628 --> 16:36.463
ALL RIGHT...

16:36.496 --> 16:41.168
EYES CLOSED,
OFF THE BACKBOARD,
NO RIM.

16:44.504 --> 16:47.407
WHY DO YOU ALWAYS
CALL CRAP YOU KNOW
YOU CAN'T MAKE?

16:47.440 --> 16:49.309
JUST TRYING
TO PSYCHE YOU OUT.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.744
OH, WELL, HEY...
GOOD STRATEGY.

16:51.778 --> 16:53.680
I'M REALLY
INTIMIDATED.

16:58.151 --> 16:59.486
EDDIE?

17:05.825 --> 17:07.460
I'VE COME BACK...

17:07.494 --> 17:09.396
TO TELL YOU
TO LET GO.

17:09.429 --> 17:11.798
YOU'RE ALIVE!

17:11.831 --> 17:13.166
OK.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.567
KENNY SAID
YOU WERE DEAD.

17:14.601 --> 17:15.602
NO, HE DIDN'T.

17:15.635 --> 17:16.503
YES, HE DID.

17:16.536 --> 17:20.440
NO, I THINK
YOU'RE CONFUSED.
RIGHT

17:20.473 --> 17:22.375
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN
ON THIS ONE, BUDDY.

17:22.409 --> 17:23.843
NO, NO, NO, NO.
SOMEBODY...

17:23.876 --> 17:26.379
SOMEBODY DIED.
WHO WAS IT?
IT WAS--

17:26.413 --> 17:27.647
OH, OH,
OH, MY GOD.

17:27.680 --> 17:29.816
WASN'T ME.

17:31.851 --> 17:33.486
OW!

17:38.458 --> 17:39.392
AH...

17:39.426 --> 17:41.428
OH! OH!

17:41.461 --> 17:43.396
EDDIE...

17:43.430 --> 17:45.098
WHOA!

17:50.703 --> 17:53.373
YEAH. NEXT MORNING,
BOOM! SHE DUMPED ME.

17:53.406 --> 17:54.141
POOR EDDIE.

17:54.174 --> 17:55.775
OH, NO, NO, NO.
NOT "POOR EDDIE."

17:55.808 --> 17:57.177
POOR EVERYBODY ELSE.

17:57.210 --> 17:58.178
HEY, I SUFFER, TOO.

17:58.211 --> 17:59.846
SUFF--YOU NEVER
SUFFER. COME ON.

17:59.879 --> 18:02.582
YOU DO WHATEVER
YOU WANT, AND IT JUST
ROLLS OFF YOUR BACK.

18:02.615 --> 18:03.883
OK, LET'S FORGET IT.
ALWAYS.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.852
ALL RIGHT, GREAT.
ALL RIGHT, LATER.

18:05.885 --> 18:06.819
YEAH, LATER.

18:06.853 --> 18:08.588
OK, BYE! BYE!

18:08.788 --> 18:11.358
WELL, NOW THAT
HE'S GONE, WHO'S GONNA
BE THE GUM PENNY?

18:11.391 --> 18:12.892
WHO CARES?
JUST TAKE IT
OFF THE TABLE.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.261
WELL, I HOPE YOU'RE
PROUD OF YOURSELF.

18:14.294 --> 18:18.265
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE IT
IF YOUR BROTHER TOLD
THAT ABBY STORY ABOUT YOU?

18:18.298 --> 18:20.300
WELL, THAT DOESN'T
WORK AS AN ARGUMENT,
DAD, OK?

18:20.333 --> 18:23.503
BECAUSE IF HE TOLD
THAT STORY ABOUT ME,
HE'D BE LYING.

18:23.536 --> 18:26.439
BUT ADMIT IT...
IT WOULD STING.

18:26.473 --> 18:28.408
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM,
DAD. WHAT'S WRONG?

18:28.441 --> 18:31.678
WELL, YOU--YOU NEVER
CUT ME ANY SLACK AT ALL,

18:31.711 --> 18:33.513
AND EDDIE DOES
WHATEVER HE WANTS,

18:33.546 --> 18:37.517
AND YOU JUST--
YOU DO BACKFLIPS
TO DEFEND HIM.

18:38.551 --> 18:40.220
EDDIE'S...EDDIE.

18:40.253 --> 18:43.223
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

18:43.656 --> 18:45.858
THAT I EXPECT
MORE FROM YOU.

18:45.892 --> 18:48.328
REALLY?

18:48.695 --> 18:51.464
WELL, WHAT,
ARE YOU GONNA GET
ALL BLUBBERY NOW?

18:51.498 --> 18:52.732
NO.

18:54.467 --> 18:57.237
THANKS. YOU KNOW,
THAT MEANS A LOT
COMING FROM YOU, AND...

18:57.270 --> 19:01.208
ALL RIGHT,
WHO LANDED
ON MARVIN GARDENS?

19:02.475 --> 19:03.676
HENRY, WHERE
ARE THE DICE?

19:03.710 --> 19:07.380
THEY'RE
SOMEWHERE
ON MY BODY.

19:07.414 --> 19:09.649
THAT IS REALLY
NOT SANITARY.

19:09.682 --> 19:12.585
BUT IT'S REALLY FUN.

19:13.253 --> 19:14.821
AND WHEN HE TOUCHED ME...

19:14.854 --> 19:17.557
IT WAS LIKE FRANTIC
MONKEY FINGERS

19:17.590 --> 19:20.460
MOVING ACROSS
MY NAKED BODY.

19:20.493 --> 19:21.494
WHOA.

19:21.528 --> 19:25.365
AND THE WAY
WE SCREAMED
AS WE--

19:25.398 --> 19:26.433
AAH! LILY...

19:26.466 --> 19:27.700
NOT NOW, MOM.
GO ON.

19:27.734 --> 19:29.569
YOU WERE
SCREAMING.
MM-HMM.

19:29.602 --> 19:31.438
UPSTAIRS.

19:31.471 --> 19:33.506
WHAT A GYP.

19:37.244 --> 19:40.313
EDDIE, EDDIE,
HEY, I...

19:40.347 --> 19:42.482
I'M SORRY I--
I TORE YOUR SHIRT.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.451
OH, THAT'S
ALL RIGHT, MAN.
IT ONLY COST 10 BUCKS.

19:44.484 --> 19:47.587
OH, COME ON.
YOU SAID IT COST
80 BUCKS BACK IN THERE.

19:47.620 --> 19:50.623
IT HAD AN $80 VALUE.

19:52.925 --> 19:55.628
YOU KNOW, I REALLY
CARED ABOUT ABBY.

19:55.662 --> 19:56.529
WELL, YEAH.
YOU SHOULD HAVE

19:56.563 --> 20:00.367
THOUGHT ABOUT THAT
BEFORE YOU DIED, RIGHT?

20:00.400 --> 20:01.401
WHAT IS THAT?

20:01.434 --> 20:03.703
WHY ARE YOU
ALWAYS ON ME?

20:03.736 --> 20:04.871
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW.

20:04.904 --> 20:07.540
IT'S JUST, YOU GOT--
YOU GOT ALL THIS FREEDOM,
YOU KNOW?

20:07.574 --> 20:09.676
Y-Y-YOU COME AND GO
AS YOU PLEASE.

20:09.709 --> 20:12.879
YOU DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.
NOTHIN' TIES YOU DOWN.

20:12.912 --> 20:14.247
I GOT MARRIED
WHEN I WAS 18.

20:14.281 --> 20:16.649
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT'S LIKE.

20:16.683 --> 20:18.351
HEY, LOOKIT,

20:18.385 --> 20:20.420
YOU GOT CLAUDIA.

20:20.453 --> 20:23.890
YOU GOT SOME KIND

20:23.923 --> 20:24.924

20:24.957 --> 20:26.993

20:27.026 --> 20:30.763

I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW,
HEY, FREE CABLE, FOOD...

20:30.797 --> 20:33.733

20:36.636 --> 20:37.970
SO, YOU WANNA--

20:49.616 --> 20:50.983
AND I THINK YOU MIGHT
HAVE BEEN DRINKING.

20:51.017 --> 20:52.352
I MIGHT HAVE BEEN.

20:52.385 --> 20:53.019
MM-HMM.

20:53.052 --> 20:54.487
OH, I COULD
GIVE YOU A RIDE.

20:54.521 --> 20:56.589

21:11.671 --> 21:12.939

21:15.708 --> 21:18.378

21:28.721 --> 21:32.725

21:40.933 --> 21:43.736
AND IF YOU NEVER

22:09.729 --> 22:11.431
WHILE WE'RE STILL ALIVE?

22:11.464 --> 22:12.264
NO.

22:12.298 --> 22:13.032
I COULD USE A COUPLE
OF HUNDRED DOLLARS

22:13.065 --> 22:14.567

WHILE I'M IN JAIL.

22:14.601 --> 22:16.736
