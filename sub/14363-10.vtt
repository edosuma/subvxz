00:06.964 --> 00:09.693
Okay, Mike, I just stepped
on a fork in the tub.

00:09.693 --> 00:11.347
How many times have we told the kids,

00:11.348 --> 00:14.631
we wash spoons in the tub,
knives and forks in the bathroom sink?

00:14.632 --> 00:15.661
It's just common sense.

00:15.662 --> 00:18.722
[Sighs] This is crazy.
We can't go on like this.

00:18.723 --> 00:21.210
We need a silverware caddy in the shower.

00:21.211 --> 00:23.094
I might have something
in the garage we can use.

00:23.095 --> 00:24.509
How 'bout that old ice bucket that says,

00:24.510 --> 00:26.685
- "it's 5:00 somewhere"?
- Oh, you know what?

00:26.686 --> 00:30.519
Since the dishwasher's not working right now,
we could use the caddy from there.

00:30.520 --> 00:33.314
We'll just hang it on the showerhead
where the shampoo thing usually goes.

00:33.315 --> 00:34.326
That would be perfect!

00:34.327 --> 00:36.847
Are you sad right now? 'Cause I'm really sad.

00:36.848 --> 00:40.550
Look. I know we wanted to save money,
and we gave it our best shot,

00:40.551 --> 00:43.537
but despite how much I'm gonna
miss this whole hose situation,

00:43.538 --> 00:45.899
- it's time to fix the sink.
- Mm.

00:46.657 --> 00:51.572
- Gorillas... tigers...
- Should we ask?

00:51.573 --> 00:54.613
If we don't, it'll just look
bad when the school calls.

00:54.614 --> 00:56.486
Okay, what's going on, Brick?

00:56.487 --> 01:01.303

Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding!

01:05.042 --> 01:07.071
I was online doing research
for my pyramid paper,

01:07.072 --> 01:09.809
and I found something
called "The $25,000 Pyramid."

01:09.810 --> 01:13.631
Then I started watching
other game shows. Fascinating.

01:13.632 --> 01:14.619

Hi-larious.

That is one foxy lady.

01:20.440 --> 01:22.303
- Mm-hmm.
- And they were all having so much fun

01:22.304 --> 01:23.576
at a time when things were tough.

01:23.577 --> 01:25.396
Seems like we could use a
little of that around here.

01:25.397 --> 01:27.528

Civilians can't do it like us.

Do you know how easy it
is to overwhelm a potato

01:44.823 --> 01:45.674

01:45.675 --> 01:47.939
Let me end the suspense for you... very.

01:47.940 --> 01:50.143
- Oh, Sue, I'm sorry.
- Tough break.

01:50.144 --> 01:52.076
Mike, weren't you just
saying that you needed someone

01:52.077 --> 01:54.017
- to help you at the quarry?
- Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.

01:54.018 --> 01:55.447
I'll take it. I don't care what it is.

01:55.448 --> 01:56.878
I'll do it. [Gasps] Do I get a name tag?

01:56.879 --> 01:58.708
How 'bout a cubicle? Doesn't matter. I'm in.

01:58.709 --> 02:00.612
Sue, trust me, you're not even gonna want it.

02:11.508 --> 02:13.692
[Scoffs] You're letting
her clean your toilets.

02:13.693 --> 02:16.574

- Oh, my God, Dad.

Well, I might have an

but I guess I can let one go.

02:46.255 --> 02:47.654

Right now a free sink is
about all we can afford.

Of course, we'll have to
take out all the formica,

Nope, he's not back in
school for another week,

03:17.323 --> 03:20.017
We were excited when he moved
from his bed to the couch today.

It sounds like you don't have
a whole lot of faith in him.

Oh, no, I don't have any faith in him.

So where you from, Mike?

09:46.714 --> 09:48.143
I'm from this couch.

09:48.144 --> 09:49.422
That's my favorite part of the house.

09:49.423 --> 09:51.914

and stupid this was?!

18:50.757 --> 18:52.781
I could be held liable. I could lose my job.

18:52.782 --> 18:56.622
[Sobbing] I'm so sorry!

18:56.623 --> 18:58.553
Yeah, you're sorry. You oughta be sorry.

18:58.554 --> 18:59.794
We already don't have any money!

18:59.795 --> 19:00.998
What do you think could happen then?

19:00.999 --> 19:03.307
[Sobbing] Huh? Huh? Think of all
the things that could have happened.

19:03.308 --> 19:06.882
Someone could have been drinking,
gotten in a car, and killed a family!

19:06.883 --> 19:08.318
- And a baby.
- And a baby!

19:08.970 --> 19:11.468
I could have killed a baby!

19:11.469 --> 19:13.607
How the hell could you let
someone like this happen?!

19:13.608 --> 19:14.567
Huh? Tell me that!

19:14.568 --> 19:17.815
Why... why weren't there
any people at Arby's?

19:17.816 --> 19:19.331
<i>Arby's? What the...</i>

19:19.332 --> 19:20.048
Dad, you seem upset.

19:20.049 --> 19:21.933
Can I offer you a glass
of nice refreshing water

19:21.934 --> 19:22.961
from the sink I just fixed?

19:22.962 --> 19:25.100
[Continues sobbing] You should ground me.

19:25.101 --> 19:26.337
Oh, you're gonna get grounded.

19:26.338 --> 19:28.524
You haven't seen grounded
like you're gonna get grounded.

19:28.525 --> 19:30.588
Whatever you do to me is not gonna be enough!

19:30.589 --> 19:34.113
This was supposed to be the year of Sue!

19:34.114 --> 19:36.669
[Sobbing] And I blew it!

19:39.059 --> 19:41.224
[Dog barking in distance]

19:42.905 --> 19:44.903
Frankie, I'm shaking, I'm so mad.

19:44.904 --> 19:46.627
You should have seen this party.

19:46.628 --> 19:50.951
If anything had happened, we...
We could have lost everything.

19:50.952 --> 19:53.535
[Exhales deeply] You
know, she didn't plan it.

19:53.536 --> 19:54.180
Still.

19:54.181 --> 19:56.470
I never should have given her
the keys in the first place.

19:57.575 --> 19:59.239
Y... [sighs] I guess I'd expect

19:59.240 --> 20:01.405
this kind of idiot behavior from Axl,

20:01.406 --> 20:03.864
- but not Sue.
- Mm-hmm.

20:04.522 --> 20:06.852
I gotta ground her. Six months, minimum.

20:06.853 --> 20:09.455
Ooh, six months? [Sighs]

20:09.456 --> 20:11.211
It's her senior year.

20:11.212 --> 20:12.685
She's gotta learn.

20:12.686 --> 20:15.884
- [Sighs]
- [Paper rustles]

20:21.862 --> 20:24.111
"Dear Dad/Mr. H.,

20:24.112 --> 20:26.671
"I'm so, so very, very sorry.

20:26.672 --> 20:28.986
"You gave me the greatest
opportunity in the world

20:28.987 --> 20:30.998
"when you hired me to work with you

20:30.999 --> 20:32.933
"and clean trailer toilets

20:32.934 --> 20:35.126
"and do so many other cool things.

20:35.127 --> 20:37.207
"You put your trust in me, and I just

20:37.208 --> 20:39.760
"hope that one day I might be able

20:39.761 --> 20:42.759
- to win back your trust because..."
- [Paper rustles]

20:44.349 --> 20:48.006
<i>"Because it's so important
to me that you can trust me,</i>

20:48.007 --> 20:50.237
- and I'll do whatever I can to..."
- [Paper slides]

20:51.179 --> 20:52.901
[Sighing]

20:58.446 --> 21:00.397
[Sighs] Maybe two months.

21:01.372 --> 21:04.532
<i>Altogether, Sue slipped 22 pages</i>

21:04.533 --> 21:05.537
<i>under the door that night.</i>

21:06.228 --> 21:09.107
<i>Mike's punishment went from
six months to six weeks,</i>

21:09.108 --> 21:10.709
<i>but Sue didn't think it was enough,</i>

21:10.710 --> 21:12.175
<i>so she jacked it back up to eight.</i>

21:12.176 --> 21:15.898
<i>Then we slowly forgot about it,
and it petered out around four.</i>

21:15.899 --> 21:17.330
<i>On the plus side,</i>

21:17.331 --> 21:18.914
<i>when the final scores were tabulated,</i>

21:18.915 --> 21:22.278
<i>Sue was the big winner in
Brick's game show extravaganza.</i>

21:22.279 --> 21:24.986
<i>Hey, you take the wins where you can get 'em.</i>
