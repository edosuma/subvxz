It's too expensive to do both.

with Jan or Sam.

actually sound pretty fun.

on this one.

You guys could Jet Ski
together.

what's going on with you?

something that upset you?

- No.
What are you talking about?

- Well, I'm just saying, like,
was it about your drawing?

09:13.261 --> 09:14.679
Is it because I didn't like
your drawings?

a picture of it.

10:14.239 --> 10:15.532
She's apparently been cheating
on me with one

10:15.573 --> 10:17.242
of her professors,
so I guess it was just, like,

10:17.283 --> 10:19.911
a old professor penis.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.413
And I don't know
how I could tell that.

10:21.454 --> 10:22.789
It's not like they get--

10:22.831 --> 10:23.873
they don't get rings
around them

10:23.915 --> 10:25.792
like some sort of penis tree.

10:26.835 --> 10:28.628
I hear myself saying "penis"
a lot

10:28.670 --> 10:33.049
and I--that's not--I don't
wanna seem fixated on that.

10:33.091 --> 10:34.926
She has no idea I know,
and I haven't broken up

10:34.968 --> 10:36.511
with her yet because we've been
together so long,

10:36.553 --> 10:39.639
I have no idea how to even
approach that conversation,

10:39.681 --> 10:41.641
and on top of that, we're
currently on a family vacation,

10:41.683 --> 10:43.184
sharing a hotel room
with my parents,

10:43.226 --> 10:44.561
and there's also
the possibility

10:44.602 --> 10:45.645
that none of that matters
at all

10:45.687 --> 10:48.064
and I'm just scared and sad.

10:48.106 --> 10:49.858
And I didn't mean to come up
and ramble to you

10:49.899 --> 10:51.109
and say penis a whole bunch
of times.

10:51.151 --> 10:53.445
I just wanted you to know
the..

10:53.486 --> 10:55.697
situation.

10:55.739 --> 10:56.823
I won't bother you again.

10:56.865 --> 10:59.451
- Hey, how's your neck?

11:00.994 --> 11:02.704
- Oh, good. Thanks.

11:02.746 --> 11:03.830
- Why don't you take this?

11:03.872 --> 11:05.957
I think you need it more
than I do.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.834
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

11:07.876 --> 11:12.172
* *

11:12.213 --> 11:14.007
How's my glue job holding up?

11:14.049 --> 11:15.675
- That turned out pretty good,
I think.

11:15.717 --> 11:17.761
I mean, it itches a little,
but...

11:17.802 --> 11:20.680
- In success
it's gonna look like this one.

11:20.722 --> 11:22.098
- Oh, that looks horrible.

11:22.140 --> 11:23.850
- What?

11:23.892 --> 11:26.019
- Who did that?
- A hockey stick.

11:26.061 --> 11:28.396
- No, no, like the glue job
itself is really scary.

11:28.438 --> 11:29.647
- My dad did it.

11:29.689 --> 11:30.940
- Like, it's, like,
off-putting.

11:30.982 --> 11:32.609
- No, he did a great job.

11:32.650 --> 11:34.486
- If you had shown that to me,

11:34.527 --> 11:36.529
I would've run to the hospital.

11:36.571 --> 11:37.947
- I suggested the hospital.

11:37.989 --> 11:40.408
It was the first thing I...

11:42.952 --> 11:44.829
Did you find your skateboard?

11:44.871 --> 11:46.623
- Uh, no.

11:46.664 --> 11:48.500
No, it's not looking too good.

11:48.541 --> 11:49.709
- [laughs]

11:49.751 --> 11:51.086
I'm sure it'll turn up.

11:51.127 --> 11:54.422
- At least your drink
is helping with the pain.

11:54.464 --> 11:56.883
- Give me that.

11:56.925 --> 11:59.552
* *

11:59.594 --> 12:02.889
[laughs]

12:02.931 --> 12:04.724
When do you leave?

12:04.766 --> 12:06.559
- In two days, then home.

12:06.601 --> 12:10.146
- Where's home?
- Mm, sorting that one out.

12:10.188 --> 12:11.022
Detroit.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.482
- That's far from me.

12:12.524 --> 12:13.983
San Diego.
- Ah.

12:14.025 --> 12:16.569
Well, guess we'll never see
each other.

12:16.611 --> 12:18.780
- Wait, well, what do you got
going on tomorrow?

12:18.822 --> 12:24.411
- Um, I have plans.

12:24.452 --> 12:25.704
What about tonight?

12:25.745 --> 12:27.706
Oliver invited me
to the staff Christmas party.

12:27.747 --> 12:30.000
- Yeah? You think he's okay
with you bringing me to that?

12:30.041 --> 12:32.961
- Well, if he's not,
then I'll ditch you.

12:33.003 --> 12:34.421
You wanna meet
at the iguana painting?

12:34.462 --> 12:35.547
- Sure.
- 10:30?

12:35.588 --> 12:36.798
- Yeah, okay.
- Yeah.

12:36.840 --> 12:39.801
Cool, say hi
to the professor fucker for me.

12:39.843 --> 12:41.428
Yeah?
- I--I'll do that. Thank you.

12:41.469 --> 12:43.930
- [laughs]

12:49.686 --> 12:50.770
- It's an end of an umbrella

12:50.812 --> 12:52.731
that it sharpened out.

12:52.772 --> 12:56.901
- Okay, they said it's the best
so you have to try it.

12:56.943 --> 12:58.069
- No.
- Dad.

12:58.111 --> 13:00.071
- Vi, no, no.
- Come on.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.032
Just a bite.
- No, thank you.

13:06.077 --> 13:07.704
Octopus
is an intelligent animal.

13:07.746 --> 13:09.789
- It tastes like a Band-Aid.

13:09.831 --> 13:11.541
- Well, folks...

13:11.583 --> 13:14.878
- Oh, maybe stick
with the Philadelphia roll.

13:14.919 --> 13:16.713
- Your mom loved those.

13:16.755 --> 13:17.964
[clears throat]

13:18.006 --> 13:20.967
[soft music]

13:21.009 --> 13:24.054
* *

13:24.095 --> 13:26.723
So, Squirt,

13:26.765 --> 13:30.268
I was thinking maybe we could
take a little trip tomorrow.

13:30.310 --> 13:33.229
Maybe check out some ruins
or a cenote.

13:33.271 --> 13:35.565
- Um, I already made plans.

13:35.607 --> 13:38.276
* *

13:38.318 --> 13:41.071
- Okay.

13:41.112 --> 13:43.573
- I, um...

13:43.615 --> 13:45.408
I met a guy.

13:45.450 --> 13:47.619
He was skateboarding
and crashed into a palm tree,

13:47.660 --> 13:49.829
and I had to superglue
his head together, and, um...

13:49.871 --> 13:51.748
- [laughs]
- We have a date tonight.

13:51.790 --> 13:54.167
- [laughs]

13:54.209 --> 13:56.586
That's a lot of information.

13:56.628 --> 13:57.504
Did you use my glue?

13:57.545 --> 13:59.673
- Yeah.

13:59.714 --> 14:02.133
- You did my thing? [laughs]

14:02.175 --> 14:03.385
Did you replace it?

14:03.426 --> 14:05.095
- No.

14:05.136 --> 14:06.805
I put it back in the bag.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.264
[both laugh]

14:08.306 --> 14:10.350
- That sounds about right.

14:12.310 --> 14:15.397
- What about Saturday?

14:15.438 --> 14:18.066
- Yeah, Saturday sounds great.

14:18.108 --> 14:20.610
* *

14:20.652 --> 14:23.738
- Um, Dad, can I--

14:23.780 --> 14:25.865
can--can I--can I go?

14:25.907 --> 14:27.325
I'll explain it later.
I just...

14:27.367 --> 14:28.410
- Okay, yeah, sure.
- It's okay?

14:28.451 --> 14:29.577
- Yeah, go.
- Okay.

14:29.619 --> 14:30.954
- Have fun.
- Merry Christmas.

14:30.995 --> 14:32.038
- Merry Christmas.

14:32.080 --> 14:36.876
* *

14:36.918 --> 14:40.005
Can I get a Sapporo, large?

14:40.046 --> 14:42.340
- Yes, sir.

14:54.728 --> 14:55.979
- Whoa!
- Ope, neck.

14:56.021 --> 14:56.980
- Oh, it's okay.
- Sorry.

14:57.022 --> 14:58.023
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:58.064 --> 14:59.816
- Your hair's big.
- Oh.

14:59.858 --> 15:01.735
Thanks? Um--
- I don't know why I said that.

15:01.776 --> 15:03.028
- Yeah.
- [laughs]

15:03.069 --> 15:05.155
- Um--
- What were you gonna say?

15:05.196 --> 15:06.865
- I found your board.

15:06.906 --> 15:07.949
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

15:07.991 --> 15:09.993
But, like,
an off-brand Santa's

15:10.035 --> 15:11.327
kind of riding on it, so...
- What?

15:11.369 --> 15:14.039
- Yeah,
I think he went this way.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.623
- You know, I saw a creepy
Santa on the penthouse balcony

15:15.665 --> 15:17.125
this morning.
That must be his room.

15:17.167 --> 15:18.960
- Yeah, but why the fuck
does he have your board?

15:19.002 --> 15:20.003
- I have no idea.

15:20.045 --> 15:21.338
- What are you gonna say
to him?

15:21.379 --> 15:22.756
- I don't know, I mean,
I've honestly never--

15:22.797 --> 15:24.132
- What if he puts up a fight?

15:24.174 --> 15:25.258
- You think he might
put up a fight?

15:25.300 --> 15:26.718
- I don't know.
He might.

15:26.760 --> 15:28.762
- That's a situation I'd be
completely unprepared for.

15:28.803 --> 15:29.929

15:29.971 --> 15:31.598
[upbeat percussive music]

15:31.639 --> 15:33.475

- What's up?

15:33.516 --> 15:35.018
- Shit.

15:35.060 --> 15:38.271
I don't think this card
gets us up to the penthouse.

15:38.313 --> 15:39.522
[buzzer sounds]

15:39.564 --> 15:41.733
- Fuck it.
Wanna just go to the party?

15:41.775 --> 15:44.486
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

15:44.527 --> 15:45.904
- It's just a lot
of information

15:45.945 --> 15:47.655
on a small napkin.
- I don't know how to read it.

15:47.697 --> 15:49.616
- You can.
- Okay, wait. I need the code.

15:49.657 --> 15:52.285
What does that say? 286.

15:52.327 --> 15:55.163
[lock beeps]
- Oh, hey, hey, hey.

15:55.205 --> 15:56.581
And they're definitely cool
with us coming?

15:56.623 --> 15:58.500
- Uh, me, yeah.

15:58.541 --> 16:00.210
- Right,
so worst-case scenario,

16:00.251 --> 16:01.544
you're cool
to go in and then I'm--

16:01.586 --> 16:03.171
I'm imprisoned here
for the rest--

16:03.213 --> 16:05.048
- Oh, shit.
Do you hear the music?

16:05.090 --> 16:06.466
[bass thumping]
- Do not--

16:06.508 --> 16:08.885
- Don't go there.
- Do not go there. Okay.

16:08.927 --> 16:10.553
- That'd be fun.

16:10.595 --> 16:13.098
* *

Hey, guys,
I swear we're invited.

Oh, this is my friend Sam.

16:38.623 --> 16:40.417
- Hey.
- Nice to meet you, Sam.

16:40.458 --> 16:42.127
Glad you're here.
- Thanks for having us.

16:42.168 --> 16:43.128
- Yeah,
you want something to drink?

- I love your top.
- ¿Cómo?

16:54.764 --> 16:57.308
- Where did you get your top?
- I'm not this cool.

16:57.350 --> 16:58.476
My friend made it for me.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.103
- Oh, wow.
I want it.

- Yeah.

Yeah. You dance. I got it.

a lot.

The bar is already closed
for Christmas.

18:06.711 --> 18:09.214
Can I help you find your room?

18:11.549 --> 18:15.011
Is there anyone I can call?

18:15.053 --> 18:17.639
- No.

18:17.681 --> 18:24.604
No, uh, my wife died
a year ago,

18:24.646 --> 18:28.900
and my daughter wanted
to spend Christmas here

18:28.942 --> 18:32.737

with me, so...
