00:02.075 --> 00:03.476
LINDSAY: Previously
on The Practice:

00:04.511 --> 00:07.114
His name is James McNoun.

00:07.147 --> 00:09.282
He's a business associate
of Marcia's.

00:09.316 --> 00:11.784
The police have issued
no statement as of yet,

00:11.818 --> 00:15.188
except to confirm that
a fatal shooting did take place

00:15.222 --> 00:16.456
in the senator's home.

00:16.489 --> 00:17.857
KENNETH: This is Alan Lowe.

00:17.890 --> 00:19.292
He just came over
from Middlesex.

00:19.326 --> 00:20.427
Why do I care?

00:20.460 --> 00:22.229
Because he's
your backup on this.

00:22.262 --> 00:24.631
My father didn't know
about the affair,

00:24.664 --> 00:26.399
but I certainly did.

00:26.433 --> 00:29.669
First I got the gun,
and I shot Mr. McNoun.

00:29.702 --> 00:31.971
Your Honor--
Chambers!

00:32.003 --> 00:34.574
No question. We're having
our hand forced by perjury,

00:34.607 --> 00:37.244
but the likelihood is he
flipped out and he shot the guy,

00:37.277 --> 00:40.147
and we would be crazy
to walk away from this deal.

00:40.180 --> 00:42.949
I only accepted
this plea of manslaughter

00:42.982 --> 00:45.085
because my conscience
cannot permit

00:45.118 --> 00:48.788
allowing my daughter to accept
any culpability for this act.

00:48.821 --> 00:50.290
And if she is
the shooter,

00:50.323 --> 00:53.593
I am going
to eventually prove it.

00:53.626 --> 00:56.529
I say this now--
client to attorney--

00:58.131 --> 01:01.034
Jim McNoun had his affair
with Keith.

01:01.768 --> 01:03.203
What?

01:03.236 --> 01:05.372
You all were so close.

01:05.405 --> 01:07.840
You just had
the wrong spouse in bed.

01:09.576 --> 01:11.478
And the wrong one
with the gun.

01:11.511 --> 01:13.546
KEITH: I made a mistake.

01:13.580 --> 01:16.116
I will now serve time
for that mistake.

01:28.828 --> 01:30.697
I appreciate you
coming in.

01:30.730 --> 01:32.332
If this is
what I think it's about,

01:32.365 --> 01:34.734
I'm happy to have the discussion
here instead of my home.

01:34.767 --> 01:36.436
We can go
into the conference room.

01:49.516 --> 01:51.684
I won't presume
to know the anger

01:51.718 --> 01:53.486
you must feel
toward your husband.

01:53.520 --> 01:55.155
Wise choice.

01:55.188 --> 01:58.058
He's in prison for a murder
he didn't commit.

01:59.259 --> 02:01.194
Can you really
live with that?

02:02.629 --> 02:06.266
Was that your concern--
how I'm holding up?

02:06.299 --> 02:09.502
If I can negotiate
a favorable deal

02:09.536 --> 02:11.638
with the district attorney--
No.

02:11.671 --> 02:14.207
Marcia--
Ellenor...

02:14.241 --> 02:15.908
I told you
what I told you

02:15.942 --> 02:17.644
under the seal
of attorney-client--

02:17.677 --> 02:19.146
I know this, but--

02:19.179 --> 02:21.981
Then let me tell you
something you may not know.

02:22.015 --> 02:26.453
If you reveal my confidence,
I will sue you.

02:27.354 --> 02:28.955
And this firm.

02:33.626 --> 02:36.829
Do you really think I'm afraid
of being sued, Marcia?

02:39.466 --> 02:42.202
Keith can accept it this way.
Why can't you?

02:42.235 --> 02:44.804
Because I can't.

02:47.140 --> 02:49.809
If you pull
that switch, Ellenor,

02:49.842 --> 02:52.745
at least have the presence
of mind to enjoy it,

02:52.779 --> 02:54.914
because it will be
your very last act

02:54.947 --> 02:56.549
as a practicing attorney.

03:02.322 --> 03:05.325
(music playing)

03:56.943 --> 03:59.346
What time?
Around 9:30--
right after you left.

03:59.379 --> 04:00.680
Did she say
what she wanted?

04:00.713 --> 04:02.749
No. She and Ellenor went
into the conference room,

04:02.782 --> 04:04.751
but they both seemed suspicious.
Ask jimmy.

04:04.784 --> 04:05.885
(door opens)

04:09.489 --> 04:11.324
John.
How are you?

04:11.358 --> 04:12.792
I'm fine. How are you?

04:12.825 --> 04:14.494
Great, great, great.

04:14.527 --> 04:16.196
Everybody, this is, uh...

04:16.228 --> 04:18.265
Well, they know who you are.

04:18.298 --> 04:19.899
John Mockler,
this is Rebecca Washington,

04:19.932 --> 04:21.733
Jimmy Berluti, Lucy Hatcher,

04:21.767 --> 04:23.403
Eugene Young.

04:23.436 --> 04:25.004
To what do I owe this?

04:25.038 --> 04:28.008
I want to engage
your services, actually.

04:28.041 --> 04:30.843
I have a client scheduled
for execution on Thursday.

04:30.877 --> 04:33.413
He wants me to be
with him in Indiana,

04:33.446 --> 04:36.683
which means I need
local counsel up here, rule 48.

04:36.716 --> 04:38.851
Actually, I start trial
on Friday.

04:38.885 --> 04:41.121
Bobby, there's really
nothing to do.

04:41.154 --> 04:43.490
I just need somebody
of record just in case.

04:43.523 --> 04:46.226
Me. Me.

04:47.027 --> 04:49.029
I think Rebecca
might be interested.

04:49.062 --> 04:50.830
Okay, excellent.

04:50.863 --> 04:52.732
Give me ten minutes.
I'll bring you up to speed.

04:52.765 --> 04:54.067
We can meet
in the conference room.

04:58.671 --> 05:00.273
John Mockler.

05:00.307 --> 05:01.674
Who's he?

05:01.708 --> 05:04.144
He's it
for death penalty appeals.

05:04.177 --> 05:07.714
He has stayed more executions
than everybody else combined.

05:10.350 --> 05:11.584
Vivian?

05:11.618 --> 05:14.054
Hey, Eugene.

05:14.087 --> 05:15.155
Wh-what's wrong?

05:15.188 --> 05:17.824
Well, Leonard sent me.

05:18.825 --> 05:21.728
To tell you that, uh,

05:21.761 --> 05:24.231
he doesn't want you
for the parole hearing.

05:24.264 --> 05:25.832
What do you mean
he doesn't want me?

05:25.865 --> 05:28.135
He doesn't want you.

05:29.169 --> 05:30.970
Well, did he hire
somebody else?
No.

05:32.572 --> 05:36.043
He says he just wants
to represent himself this time.

05:37.944 --> 05:39.546
You know how he gets.

05:41.481 --> 05:42.615
Let's go.

05:45.318 --> 05:47.620
All federal executions
are in Indiana.

05:47.654 --> 05:49.922
Jurisdiction of the case,
though, is still in Boston,

05:49.956 --> 05:51.991
which is why
I need local counsel

05:52.025 --> 05:53.960
should there be any
last-minute appeals--

05:53.993 --> 05:56.096
which there won't be.

05:56.129 --> 05:57.430
Walter's waived them.

05:58.231 --> 05:59.266
What did he do?

05:59.299 --> 06:01.401
Killed a federal employee.

06:01.434 --> 06:04.871
It wasn't very pretty,
but that was then.

06:04.904 --> 06:08.008
Today he's
a different man.

06:09.142 --> 06:10.110
And...

06:11.244 --> 06:12.612
...he's ready to die.

06:13.713 --> 06:15.282
He wants to die?

06:16.116 --> 06:17.284
He wants closure.

06:18.018 --> 06:19.486
I was--

06:19.519 --> 06:21.754
I was hoping
I'd get to do something.

06:23.890 --> 06:25.292
Can-- can I meet him?

06:27.027 --> 06:28.995
What if
he changes his mind

06:29.029 --> 06:32.499
and suddenly does want me
to file an appeal?

06:32.532 --> 06:34.867
It would help for me to be able
to represent to the court

06:34.901 --> 06:36.336
that I know him a little.

06:37.337 --> 06:38.605
Okay. Good point.

06:39.906 --> 06:41.308
Want to come with me now?

06:41.341 --> 06:42.675
Oh, sure.

06:42.709 --> 06:43.810
Well, let's go.

06:46.046 --> 06:48.081
Keith was sleeping
with the guy,

06:48.115 --> 06:49.382
and she shot him.

06:49.916 --> 06:53.053
But she prefaced it
with client-to-attorney,

06:53.086 --> 06:55.688
and I know ordinarily
it has to be sealed,

06:55.722 --> 06:57.224
but since we represent
Keith as well,

06:57.257 --> 06:59.159
and this could help him--

06:59.192 --> 07:01.528
This is why we should have
never represented both of them.

07:01.561 --> 07:03.296
That's something
you don't need to tell me.

07:03.330 --> 07:05.665
The question is,
what do we do?

07:06.966 --> 07:08.468
I don't think
there's anything we can do.

07:08.501 --> 07:10.037
So the congressman is gay?

07:10.070 --> 07:12.072
We just sit back
and let an innocent man--

07:12.105 --> 07:13.406
You tried to convince her
to come forward?

07:13.440 --> 07:15.942
Oh, yes. She didn't
exactly waver in her response.

07:15.975 --> 07:17.410
And Keith knows
she did it,

07:17.444 --> 07:19.212
and he's taking the fall?

07:19.246 --> 07:21.014
That's another story,
but yes.

07:22.849 --> 07:25.252
Have her come in again
and see how well
she plays poker.

07:25.285 --> 07:27.820
Bobby, she doesn't
really scare.

07:27.854 --> 07:29.289
Have her come in.

07:34.561 --> 07:37.597
You're taking it personal.
It isn't personal!

07:37.630 --> 07:40.033
It should be. You--
you're the one facing life
in a prisoin cell.

07:40.067 --> 07:41.834
That's right.
I'm the one.

07:41.868 --> 07:43.636
You can't win this without
an attorney, Leonard

07:43.670 --> 07:45.405
This isn't about
winning, Eugene.

07:45.438 --> 07:46.706
The Parole Board--
Leonard--

07:46.739 --> 07:48.208
They just look at the man now.

07:48.241 --> 07:50.310
I don't need a lawyer for that.

07:50.343 --> 07:53.313
Lawyers sometimes
can obstruct the view.

07:53.346 --> 07:55.748
So this is
about punishing me.
It is personal.

07:55.782 --> 07:58.218
I know you did
the best you could.

07:58.251 --> 07:59.886
I know that.

07:59.919 --> 08:01.988
You also know that I paid
for half of the investigation

08:02.022 --> 08:05.592
with my own money,
so you don't feel entitled
to tell me you're angry.

08:05.625 --> 08:08.261
Instead, you just
dismiss me with this
passive-aggressive garbage?

08:08.295 --> 08:10.997
Hey, if I wanna fire you--
You sent your wife
to say, "Don't come."

08:11.031 --> 08:12.565
You're fired, then, okay?

08:14.301 --> 08:18.405
If that's the way you want
to hear it, hear it that way.

08:22.075 --> 08:23.210
I figured...

08:24.311 --> 08:25.878
the only chance...

08:27.014 --> 08:29.749
to convince the board
to let me go

08:29.782 --> 08:32.652
is to go in there
and put myself before them

08:32.684 --> 08:34.221
without the shield
of a lawyer.

08:34.254 --> 08:37.024
Without the advice,
because you know
what my advice would be.

08:37.057 --> 08:38.890
Enough! Shut it down!

08:46.866 --> 08:50.603
What message do you plan
to be bringing, Leonard?

08:50.637 --> 08:52.539
I am innocent.

08:54.041 --> 08:56.476
Same message
as my trial.

08:57.777 --> 08:58.978
At appeal.

09:00.247 --> 09:02.282
I'm innocent!

09:03.916 --> 09:05.485
You will lose.

09:07.887 --> 09:10.590
Now if it seems like
I'm taking this personally,

09:10.623 --> 09:12.225
it's because
I know you're innocent,

09:12.259 --> 09:14.761
and I know
I'm the lawyer who lost this.

09:17.030 --> 09:18.898
I got the witnesses
lined up.

09:18.931 --> 09:21.168
I've done my homework
on the board.

09:21.201 --> 09:23.136
Let me do this
with you, Leonard.

09:23.170 --> 09:24.837
You got a wife
out there, man,

09:24.871 --> 09:27.740
a son who wants his dad
to come home.

09:27.774 --> 09:29.309
Let me help you.

09:49.862 --> 09:52.032
Didn't you
explain it to her?

09:52.065 --> 09:54.167
Yeah, but she wanted
to meet you.

09:54.201 --> 09:55.868
Okay.

09:55.902 --> 09:57.937
Mr. Mockler tells me

09:57.970 --> 10:00.273
you've pretty much
given up hope.

10:00.307 --> 10:02.175
I'm full of hope now.

10:03.410 --> 10:05.645
I've never been so
hopeful in my life.

10:09.682 --> 10:11.751
Ms. Washington...

10:11.784 --> 10:15.688
Who I was when I committed
that crime

10:15.722 --> 10:17.424
and who I am now--.

10:19.192 --> 10:21.161
two very different people.

10:22.395 --> 10:24.097
I guess that
makes me curious

10:24.131 --> 10:27.167
as to why
the person you are now

10:27.200 --> 10:29.269
wishes to be executed.

10:29.302 --> 10:31.871
Do you know the atrocity
of my crime?

10:33.173 --> 10:36.576
I stabbed a woman
78 times.

10:44.817 --> 10:47.987
I studied this.
I prayed.

10:49.722 --> 10:52.725
I was trying to find a way
to forgive myself.

10:53.326 --> 10:54.661
And then I saw the truth.

10:56.129 --> 10:58.465
Forgiveness
is somebody else's job.

10:59.366 --> 11:00.700
And he's already done it.

11:03.203 --> 11:06.739
He washed me clean
the minute I sincerely repented.

11:09.109 --> 11:11.344
When you pray,

11:11.378 --> 11:14.514
do you tell God
what you want,

11:14.547 --> 11:17.917
or do you ask him
what He wants?

11:17.950 --> 11:22.222
God doesn't forgive you
so you can die happy.

11:23.556 --> 11:26.326
I think He washes you clean

11:26.359 --> 11:29.396
so you can start over,
so you can learn

11:29.429 --> 11:32.899
and struggle
and do His work.

11:34.734 --> 11:39.772
Walter, you could live
another 40 years.

11:39.806 --> 11:44.577
And how much good could you do
in here in that time?

11:44.611 --> 11:47.014
How many people
could you help?

11:47.047 --> 11:48.948
How many souls
could you save?

11:48.981 --> 11:51.484
Maybe you could start
some ministries.

11:53.453 --> 11:56.989
Walter, have you ever
thought of that?

12:05.198 --> 12:08.301
We could file
an emergency hearing
in first circuit.

12:08.335 --> 12:11.438
He seemed like
he might change his mind.

12:11.471 --> 12:13.406
Rebecca, let me ask you
a question.

12:13.440 --> 12:15.508
Do you think
you helped in there?

12:17.444 --> 12:19.179
First of all, there aren't
any more issues.

12:19.212 --> 12:20.313
We've exhausted them.

12:20.347 --> 12:22.115
There's always something.

12:22.149 --> 12:25.385
No. No, there's not gonna
be a stay of execution.

12:25.418 --> 12:27.720
No commutation.

12:27.754 --> 12:31.791
All you succeeded in doing
just now is agitating him.

12:31.824 --> 12:34.894
So instead of dying
with any sense of closure

12:34.927 --> 12:37.297
or feeling at peace
with God,

12:37.330 --> 12:40.767
he might now feel his death
won't be satisfactory penance.

12:42.302 --> 12:46.806
So, the one thing he had left
to cling to

12:46.839 --> 12:49.542
you perhaps
just stripped him of.

12:50.543 --> 12:52.379
He's not a cause, Rebecca.

12:52.412 --> 12:53.913
He's a human being...

12:55.848 --> 12:58.018
...who will die on Thursday.

12:59.786 --> 13:01.654
Perhaps a little more
painfully now.

13:10.763 --> 13:12.865
The prison parole officer
will testify for you.

13:12.899 --> 13:14.734
He supports your release.

13:14.767 --> 13:17.137
Well, you'd think
that should be the end of it.

13:17.170 --> 13:18.271
We wish.

13:18.305 --> 13:21.108
The board is made up
of four prosecutors,

13:21.141 --> 13:23.710
a retired police lieutenant,
a probation officer,

13:23.743 --> 13:26.446
and an advocate
for victims' rights.

13:26.479 --> 13:27.847
Stacked.

13:30.850 --> 13:31.951
Okay.

13:33.420 --> 13:35.188
Let's turn to it.

13:35.222 --> 13:36.556
You know
what I'm going to say.

13:36.589 --> 13:38.491
And you know what I'm
gonna say when you do.

13:38.525 --> 13:40.427
If you do not take
responsibility for the crime,

13:40.460 --> 13:41.961
they will never let you out.

13:41.994 --> 13:44.531
I will not say that
I committed that crime!

13:44.564 --> 13:46.466
They won't even adjourn
before they vote!

13:46.499 --> 13:47.734
I won't say--
Go to hell!

13:47.767 --> 13:49.602
You arrogant son of a bitch!

13:49.636 --> 13:51.138
Get out of here!
You want to be proud?

13:51.171 --> 13:52.472
You got a kid
at home without a father.

13:52.505 --> 13:53.773
Get out of here!
How proud is that?

13:53.806 --> 13:55.875
Hey, guard,
get him out of here!

13:55.908 --> 13:58.078
Hey, stay the hell away!
This is my client.

13:58.111 --> 14:01.448
Don't come near us.
I'm not leaving!

14:05.252 --> 14:06.919
You have to.

14:08.655 --> 14:11.024
They do not let people
out of here

14:11.058 --> 14:13.726
unless they show remorse.

14:15.062 --> 14:16.563
Now, that's the only way.

14:19.232 --> 14:21.101
That's the only way.

14:30.410 --> 14:32.379
I met with my partners
on this, Marcia,

14:32.412 --> 14:35.315
and we need to inform you
of our decision.

14:35.348 --> 14:38.185
BOBBY: After very careful
consideration,

14:38.218 --> 14:41.954
we've decided to risk sanctions
from the Massachusetts Bar,

14:41.988 --> 14:44.824
and we're going to reveal
your privileged communication

14:44.857 --> 14:46.326
to Ms. Frutt.

14:46.359 --> 14:48.995
We feel the sanctity
of the attorney-client privilege

14:49.029 --> 14:52.499
is simply outweighed
by the injustice caused
to your husband.

14:52.532 --> 14:55.001
Add to that,
as officers of the court,

14:55.035 --> 14:58.771
we feel we have an obligation
to disclose that an innocent man

14:58.805 --> 15:02.342
is serving a prison term
for a crime he didn't commit.

15:02.375 --> 15:04.544
Now, we have two choices.

15:04.577 --> 15:08.215
We can go forward
with you here,
or without.

15:08.248 --> 15:11.484
Going with you, we feel
we're in a better position
to protect you.

15:11.518 --> 15:14.021
We may even be able
to negotiate a reduced plea,

15:14.054 --> 15:16.689
given our relationship
with the district attorney.

15:16.723 --> 15:20.460
Obviously, it's best
for you to join hands
with us here.

15:23.330 --> 15:25.332
I completely agree
with you.

15:26.333 --> 15:28.368
With a few small
exceptions.

15:28.401 --> 15:31.038
First, if you reveal
a privilege,

15:31.071 --> 15:32.805
particularly this one,

15:32.839 --> 15:35.875
you don't simply risk sanctions,
you'd be disbarred.

15:35.908 --> 15:37.877
Second, by doing so,

15:37.910 --> 15:40.613
you perhaps unwittingly
shield me from any prosecution,

15:40.647 --> 15:43.916
since Ellenor won't be permitted
to testify

15:43.950 --> 15:45.952
and the DA would never be able
to build a case

15:45.985 --> 15:47.954
independent
of the poisonous fruit,

15:47.987 --> 15:49.656
to borrow a phrase
you're fond of.

15:49.689 --> 15:52.859
Third, the DA got a conviction
for this crime.

15:52.892 --> 15:55.295
Good luck getting her
to reconsider it.

15:55.328 --> 15:59.266
Fourth, I simply don't know
what Ellenor is talking about.

15:59.299 --> 16:02.102
She must've misunderstood
something I said.

16:02.135 --> 16:04.804
And fifth,
could you all go somewhere

16:04.837 --> 16:07.006
and respectively
self-fornicate?

16:12.412 --> 16:16.283
I understand I may have
perhaps riled you up.

16:16.316 --> 16:18.085
That was not my intent.

16:18.118 --> 16:19.419
I understand that.

16:19.452 --> 16:21.721
I was only trying
to convey--

16:23.423 --> 16:25.858
Walter, if you, in your mind,

16:25.892 --> 16:28.595
were choosing death
to serve God,

16:28.628 --> 16:30.697
it's possible to serve God

16:30.730 --> 16:33.466
with your life's
work as well.

16:35.035 --> 16:37.137
I think it's best
if I accept my punishment.

16:40.440 --> 16:41.574
Okay.

16:41.608 --> 16:42.975
I do thank you.

16:46.746 --> 16:47.980
Well...

16:55.155 --> 16:56.523
It was nice to meet you.

16:59.792 --> 17:02.595
It's nice to have lawyers
who believe in the Lord.

17:03.796 --> 17:06.165
I owe my salvation
to Mr. Mockler.

17:06.199 --> 17:07.534
I know that.

17:10.670 --> 17:12.972
You do? Why?

17:13.005 --> 17:16.309
He opened my heart
to Jesus.

17:16.343 --> 17:18.211
John Mockler did?

17:18.244 --> 17:19.846
Of course.

17:21.614 --> 17:23.683
Did John Mockler persuade you

17:23.715 --> 17:26.053
to sacrifice your life
for Jesus?

17:27.087 --> 17:30.790
He persuaded me
to serve Jesus.

17:31.458 --> 17:33.326
To embrace him.

17:33.360 --> 17:36.296
And you're serving him
by dying?

17:36.329 --> 17:40.367
By accepting the punishment
for my sins.

17:52.945 --> 17:54.814
Let's just start.
Can I begin?

17:54.847 --> 17:57.617
'Cause I don't think there's
anything to talk about.

17:57.650 --> 17:58.985
We can't break privilege.

17:59.019 --> 18:00.087
It's not that simple.

18:00.120 --> 18:01.721
I think it is.

18:01.754 --> 18:03.356
Privilege exists
to protect the client.

18:03.390 --> 18:05.125
Here, we have competing
client interests.

18:05.158 --> 18:06.526
It's absolute, Ellenor.
Doesn't matter.

18:06.559 --> 18:08.295
It does matter,
it's not absolute,

18:08.328 --> 18:09.296
and there are exceptions.

18:09.329 --> 18:11.464
But this doesn't qualify
as one of them.

18:11.498 --> 18:13.300
I'm just as pissed off
as you are, Ellenor.

18:13.333 --> 18:15.268
Well, obviously you're not!

18:18.538 --> 18:19.672
I'm sorry.

18:20.740 --> 18:23.310
Everything she said
is true.

18:23.343 --> 18:26.546
We'd face disbarment.
It wouldn't do any good.

18:26.579 --> 18:28.515
Plus, what you didn't
say is,

18:28.548 --> 18:31.051
we're in the business of keeping
clients' secrets,

18:31.084 --> 18:32.985
no matter what.

18:34.187 --> 18:35.888
There is one other way.

18:37.190 --> 18:38.891
Go to Keith.

18:38.925 --> 18:41.094
He can still
blow that whistle here.

18:44.297 --> 18:46.233
Can I tell him
what she told us?

18:46.266 --> 18:47.900
Is that violating
privilege?

18:47.934 --> 18:50.037
I don't think so,
and even if it does,

18:50.070 --> 18:52.772
it's nothing that she can
make a meal out of.

18:53.506 --> 18:55.608
Would you be okay with me
going to Keith?

18:59.379 --> 19:01.414
I think we can live
with that.

19:02.182 --> 19:04.084
He didn't exhaust
all the appeals.

19:04.784 --> 19:06.219
What?
John Mockler.

19:06.253 --> 19:08.055
There's some he left out
for Walter Dawson,

19:08.088 --> 19:09.489
and there have been others.

19:09.522 --> 19:10.523
What others?

19:10.557 --> 19:11.924
Death penalty clients,

19:11.958 --> 19:13.560
who suddenly found God

19:13.593 --> 19:15.562
and decided to waive
last-minute appeals.

19:16.163 --> 19:18.865
John Mockler helped them all
find God.

19:18.898 --> 19:22.402
He's helping the state
kill his clients.

19:30.077 --> 19:32.045
Is this
why you wanted to see me?

19:32.079 --> 19:35.315
You do seem to have
a high percentage of clients
who find God.

19:35.348 --> 19:37.284
Right before they die.

19:37.317 --> 19:40.320
When was the last time
you faced death, Rebecca?

19:40.353 --> 19:43.056
It can make you turn
to spirituality,
believe it or not.

19:43.090 --> 19:47.060
You said you exhausted
all of Walter Dawson's appeals.

19:47.094 --> 19:48.295
You didn't.

19:48.328 --> 19:50.163
What'd I leave out?

19:50.197 --> 19:52.665
He was diagnosed
with fetal alcohol syndrome.

19:52.699 --> 19:54.301
That was raised at trial.

19:54.334 --> 19:56.103
For diminished capacity.

19:56.136 --> 19:59.306
It should have been raised
again for sentencing.

19:59.339 --> 20:01.641
JOHN: I don't think it would
have had any effect.

20:01.674 --> 20:05.512
And I come down against drafting
kitchen sink appeals.

20:05.545 --> 20:06.913
You only lose credibility.

20:06.946 --> 20:10.583
You had another client--
Larry Wilcox?

20:10.617 --> 20:14.054
You chose to raise FAS
in his defense.

20:14.087 --> 20:16.056
I thought
it was more persuasive there.

20:16.089 --> 20:17.290
How come
you didn't try it?

20:17.324 --> 20:19.692
Because I didn't think
it would fly.

20:19.726 --> 20:21.828
And my client,
by the way,

20:21.861 --> 20:25.432
instructed me to drop
all further appeals.

20:25.465 --> 20:28.701
After you helped him
find God.

20:28.735 --> 20:31.171
Rebecca, he's gonna die.

20:31.204 --> 20:32.939
What do you suggest I do,
hand him a copy

20:32.972 --> 20:35.042
of Chicken Soup for the Soul?
All right.

20:35.075 --> 20:39.546
Now, I pursue
all viable appeals.

20:39.579 --> 20:42.682
And sometimes,
I even win them,

20:42.715 --> 20:44.517
if you bothered
to check up on that.

20:45.352 --> 20:49.322
But when there's nothing left,
when there is nothing left,

20:49.356 --> 20:52.025
I do try to give them
some consolation.

20:53.226 --> 20:55.795
If they feel they're getting
some kind of salvation,

20:55.828 --> 20:58.365
it helps.

20:58.398 --> 21:00.867
I have been there, Rebecca.
I've seen it.

21:01.434 --> 21:02.702
It helps.

21:13.246 --> 21:15.182
Ah, it's been a long time

21:15.215 --> 21:17.484
since I had on
a coat and tie.

21:19.352 --> 21:20.853
You look good, Dad.

21:20.887 --> 21:22.289
You think so?

21:22.322 --> 21:25.358
Parole officer goes up first.
He's with us.

21:25.392 --> 21:27.860
Remember, the board doesn't
figure to be sympathetic.

21:27.894 --> 21:29.396
You can't let them
antagonize you.

21:29.429 --> 21:30.597
You want to say that again?

21:30.630 --> 21:32.765
You want to give me
some sign you get it?

21:32.799 --> 21:34.267
VIVIAN: He gets it, Eugene.

21:34.301 --> 21:37.370
He's ready
to do what's necessary.

21:38.938 --> 21:40.240
Baby.

21:40.273 --> 21:43.176
All I've had
these last 12 years

21:43.210 --> 21:45.445
is my word and the truth.

21:45.478 --> 21:47.880
If I say
I killed that man--

21:48.981 --> 21:52.119
It's your only chance
to get out.

21:52.152 --> 21:54.821
There's been a lot of people
supporting me, Vivian--

21:55.322 --> 21:57.624
raising money
to pay his bills,

21:57.657 --> 22:00.927
people going to the bank
on my being innocent.

22:00.960 --> 22:03.296
What do I say to them?

22:03.330 --> 22:04.831
They all know

22:04.864 --> 22:08.135
this is part
of the game, Leonard.

22:09.802 --> 22:10.937
Me lying.

22:12.539 --> 22:16.576
I got to go and lie
to get redemption.

22:16.609 --> 22:17.777
That's the game.

22:17.810 --> 22:18.978
Dad.

22:20.280 --> 22:22.082
Just get yourself out.

22:23.583 --> 22:24.951
Come home.

22:42.102 --> 22:43.336
Ellenor went to see Keith,

22:43.370 --> 22:44.904
Eugene is
at the parole hearing,

22:44.937 --> 22:47.240
and Rebecca... (sighs)

22:51.511 --> 22:52.912
You never went home.

22:52.945 --> 22:54.747
There's more.
Rebecca--

22:54.781 --> 22:57.617
You might believe him...
but I don't.

22:57.650 --> 22:58.985
There is nobody
who's done more

22:59.019 --> 23:01.354
to fight the death penalty
than John Mockler.

23:01.388 --> 23:04.391
Bobby, there's more.

23:08.628 --> 23:10.197
What are you talking about?

23:10.730 --> 23:12.832
Keith, I know.

23:14.334 --> 23:17.104
Marcia discovered you
in bed with McNoun.

23:17.137 --> 23:18.571
She killed him.

23:19.639 --> 23:20.940
I know it all.

23:22.442 --> 23:24.644
How can you be willing
to serve a sentence

23:24.677 --> 23:27.280
for a crime
she committed?

23:29.416 --> 23:30.683
My God.

23:31.718 --> 23:34.554
Do you think being gay
is worse for your image

23:34.587 --> 23:37.024
than being thought of
as a murderer?

23:38.391 --> 23:40.493
I don't know
what you're talking about.

23:40.527 --> 23:44.231
Marcia told me to keep me
from going after Allison.

23:45.698 --> 23:47.934
She is lying!

23:47.967 --> 23:50.503
To punish me
for killing her lover!

23:50.537 --> 23:51.738
Oh, she's seeking
to punish you

23:51.771 --> 23:53.640
by confessing to me
she's a murderer.

23:53.673 --> 23:55.042
That really makes sense.

23:56.509 --> 23:58.345
Keith--

23:58.378 --> 24:00.347
I'm one
of your oldest friends.

24:02.549 --> 24:04.817
I am not gonna
love you any less

24:04.851 --> 24:06.486
because you are gay.

24:06.519 --> 24:08.355
For God's sake--

24:08.388 --> 24:10.857
Do you know
the letters I get?

24:10.890 --> 24:13.026
They think I'm a hero.

24:13.060 --> 24:14.627
"Good for you," they say.

24:14.661 --> 24:17.364
"I would have
blasted him, too."

24:17.397 --> 24:20.833
I'm a folk hero, Ellenor,
and when I get out,

24:20.867 --> 24:23.803
my constituency
will still be there.

24:24.404 --> 24:26.706
Michael Dukakis--
his career died

24:26.739 --> 24:28.441
when he reacted
with dispassion

24:28.475 --> 24:31.844
at the idea of his wife
being attacked.

24:31.878 --> 24:34.581
"Good for you,"
they say to me.

24:34.614 --> 24:37.884
"You shot the bastard.
What man wouldn't?"

24:41.421 --> 24:42.689
Please--

24:42.722 --> 24:45.125
I'm instructing you
to drop this.

24:45.158 --> 24:48.628
I made my deal.
I'm happy with the deal.

24:49.296 --> 24:50.363
And as your client,

24:50.397 --> 24:53.100
I instruct you
to just let this be.

24:56.736 --> 24:59.406
You will carry out
my wish, Ellenor.

25:05.812 --> 25:07.214
I tell inmates,

25:07.247 --> 25:09.549
"Use the time in here.
Don't let it use you."

25:09.582 --> 25:12.052
And how has Leonard Marshall
used his time?

25:12.085 --> 25:14.354
Well, he's improved
his education.

25:14.387 --> 25:16.989
When he first came to us,
he had anger issues,

25:17.024 --> 25:19.526
but now he teaches
the anger management course.

25:19.559 --> 25:22.195
A lot of the inmates
and even some of the guards,

25:22.229 --> 25:23.596
they look up to him.

25:23.630 --> 25:25.332
I'm seeing in the file
last month,

25:25.365 --> 25:27.367
they found a syringe
in his cell.

25:27.400 --> 25:29.902
I think that syringe
was planted.

25:29.936 --> 25:31.704
When a man gets
a parole hearing date,

25:31.738 --> 25:34.907
the first thing I tell him is,
"Check under your mattress,

25:34.941 --> 25:38.478
and make sure nobody frames you
by planting a knife or drugs."

25:38.511 --> 25:40.780
If Leonard Marshall
is released,

25:40.813 --> 25:42.549
does he pose any threat?

25:42.582 --> 25:44.051
Not in my opinion.

25:44.084 --> 25:45.385
How can you be sure?

25:45.418 --> 25:48.288
Well, men his age
have low recidivism rates,

25:48.321 --> 25:51.558
especially when they have
a support network
on the outside.

25:51.591 --> 25:54.561
He's got that support
from his wife and his son.

25:54.594 --> 25:56.196
Correct me if I'm wrong,

25:56.229 --> 25:58.098
but half the men
in prison today

25:58.131 --> 26:00.200
committed felony crimes
while on parole.

26:00.233 --> 26:01.434
Well...

26:01.468 --> 26:03.503
Again, correct me
if I'm wrong,

26:03.536 --> 26:08.108
but in 1991, 13,000
people were murdered
in this country

26:08.141 --> 26:11.511
by criminals
on parole or probation.

26:11.544 --> 26:13.713
Is the chairwoman
introducing evidence?

26:13.746 --> 26:15.748
Mr. Young, this is not
a court of law.

26:15.782 --> 26:17.584
The rules of evidence
do not apply.

26:17.617 --> 26:18.751
I realize that, but--

26:18.785 --> 26:22.055
Also, there's no reason
to object.

26:22.089 --> 26:25.492
No appellate court
reviews our decisions.

26:30.863 --> 26:32.165
I don't have time for this.

26:32.199 --> 26:35.202
I'm on a plane to Indiana
within the hour.

26:35.235 --> 26:37.937
Things seem to be
a little coincidental.

26:37.970 --> 26:40.473
Your most heinous clients
seem to find God

26:40.507 --> 26:42.575
and waive all their appeals.

26:42.609 --> 26:43.676
The ones
who might be innocent,

26:43.710 --> 26:45.445
you push their cases
to the end.

26:45.478 --> 26:47.180
And you think
that's coincidental,

26:47.214 --> 26:49.182
that the evil would be
more predisposed

26:49.216 --> 26:50.717
to seek redemption?

26:50.750 --> 26:54.587
You're deciding who lives
and who dies, John.

26:55.122 --> 26:57.024
The ones you choose
not to fight for,

26:57.057 --> 27:00.060
you steer them
to find religion.

27:00.093 --> 27:03.363
You're conducting
some kind of mad triage
with your clients.

27:03.396 --> 27:06.033
No, what's mad
is that suggestion.

27:06.066 --> 27:07.900
I called
a lot of the families.

27:07.934 --> 27:12.405
You influence Death Row inmates
to waive appeals,

27:12.439 --> 27:13.906
to seek salvation.

27:13.940 --> 27:15.175
I'm not listening to this.

27:15.875 --> 27:17.610
I used to respect you.

27:20.613 --> 27:23.183
All this time I thought
you were this big champion

27:23.216 --> 27:26.753
against the death penalty,
and look at what you are.

27:28.521 --> 27:32.125
Do you know when you file
for stay of execution
with the Supreme Court,

27:32.159 --> 27:34.294
you're lucky
if one of the clerks

27:34.327 --> 27:36.463
even skims your brief?

27:36.496 --> 27:38.065
Know why that is?

27:38.098 --> 27:42.569
Because every attorney
for every Death Row inmate
files,

27:42.602 --> 27:45.238
claiming his case is special.

27:45.272 --> 27:46.939
And eventually all of them--

27:46.973 --> 27:50.443
all of them,
even the legitimate ones--

27:50.477 --> 27:52.312
fall on deaf ears.

27:52.345 --> 27:54.647
Now, I'll tell you
what the problem is, Rebecca.

27:54.681 --> 27:59.819
Defense attorneys
have no credibility anymore.

27:59.852 --> 28:02.755
They pay attention when I call

28:02.789 --> 28:04.691
because I don't waste
their time.

28:06.026 --> 28:09.362
There is a reason
I've gotten more stays

28:09.396 --> 28:10.863
than any other lawyer.

28:10.897 --> 28:14.301
So you weed out the good cases
from the bad

28:14.334 --> 28:17.204
and sacrifice people
like Walter Dawson?

28:17.237 --> 28:21.208
I did everything I could
for Walter.

28:23.276 --> 28:26.246
And I will be at his side
tonight.

28:31.951 --> 28:33.353
Bye Bobby.

28:42.429 --> 28:44.897
Finding out it was Leonard
who did it

28:44.931 --> 28:47.500
was almost as painful
as losing Jack.

28:48.368 --> 28:49.702
We were all friends.

28:49.736 --> 28:51.604
At least I thought we were.

28:52.039 --> 28:54.474
How do you feel
about granting parole
to this man?

28:54.507 --> 28:56.676
I'm a Christian woman,

28:56.709 --> 29:00.113
so forgiving people is something
I have to try to do.

29:00.847 --> 29:02.782
It took me a long time,

29:02.815 --> 29:06.153
but I did forgive Leonard,
and I pray for him.

29:06.186 --> 29:08.788
You've heard the testimony
about the prisoner's

29:08.821 --> 29:10.823
exemplary behavior
over many years.

29:10.857 --> 29:13.926
Sounds like the Leonard Marshall
I used to know.

29:13.960 --> 29:16.096
Are you saying
you support parole

29:16.129 --> 29:18.131
for your husband's killer,
Mrs. Horan?

29:18.165 --> 29:21.134
I don't believe
in an eye for an eye,

29:21.668 --> 29:24.537
but I wouldn't want
another family to be destroyed

29:24.571 --> 29:26.573
like mine was,

29:26.606 --> 29:29.642
so I pray
that you keep him in prison

29:29.676 --> 29:31.711
for as long as he lives.

29:35.815 --> 29:36.983
Thank you.

29:39.186 --> 29:40.653
We'll take
a 15-minute break

29:40.687 --> 29:42.289
and then we'll hear
from Mr. Marshall.

29:47.860 --> 29:49.362
It comes down to you.

29:50.997 --> 29:53.033
I don't think I can
say it, Eugene.

29:54.834 --> 29:57.037
I cannot say I'm guilty.

29:57.837 --> 29:59.906
If you don't, Leonard,

29:59.939 --> 30:02.309
you will spend
the rest of your life in prison.

30:12.852 --> 30:15.155
I swore to my wife and son...

30:16.256 --> 30:19.926
that I wouldn't let prison
make me hard or break me.

30:21.861 --> 30:23.263
And if it wasn't for them...

30:26.266 --> 30:28.068
I don't know.

30:28.535 --> 30:31.504
It sounds like you've done
better in prison than out.

30:32.639 --> 30:34.607
I'm sorry?
Well, on the streets,

30:34.641 --> 30:36.809
you seem to have had trouble
holding a job,

30:36.843 --> 30:39.246
and when you got fired
from the garage,

30:39.279 --> 30:40.980
you got angry
and committed murder.

30:41.014 --> 30:43.416
Is it possible
you do better

30:43.450 --> 30:45.718
in a more structured
environment?

30:48.088 --> 30:50.223
What are your plans
if you're released?

30:50.257 --> 30:52.459
LEONARD: After what
I've been through here,

30:53.126 --> 30:55.028
I'd like to find a way

30:55.062 --> 30:59.132
to... help kids
stay out of trouble,

30:59.166 --> 31:03.470
maybe become a counselor
or a teacher or something.

31:04.337 --> 31:08.741
At trial, you denied
murdering Jack Horan,

31:08.775 --> 31:10.010
is that correct?

31:10.710 --> 31:11.678
Yes.

31:11.711 --> 31:13.813
And you continued
to deny your guilt

31:13.846 --> 31:15.815
throughout
the appellate process.

31:16.716 --> 31:17.884
Yes.

31:17.917 --> 31:21.388
Do you now accept responsibility
for your crime?

31:24.057 --> 31:26.859
Mr. Marshall,
did you not hear my question?

31:30.330 --> 31:32.432
I heard the question.

31:32.465 --> 31:36.669
Sir, Mrs. Horan
is sitting right there.

31:36.703 --> 31:38.671
She's been waiting 12 years

31:38.705 --> 31:40.807
for you to finally tell
the truth.

31:40.840 --> 31:42.775
Is that gonna happen
today?

31:56.256 --> 31:57.457
Mrs. Horan...

31:59.492 --> 32:02.695
I know you suffered so much.

32:05.765 --> 32:07.134
And I'm sorry...

32:15.108 --> 32:18.711
...but I did not kill
your husband.

32:23.816 --> 32:25.085
Mr. Marshall...

32:26.919 --> 32:31.691
Taking responsibility
means admitting the crime.

32:32.192 --> 32:34.761
Even if it's not the truth?

32:34.794 --> 32:35.862
Leonard--

32:35.895 --> 32:38.831
Mr. Marshall,
I will remind you, sir,

32:38.865 --> 32:42.169
accountability is
a condition for parole.

32:42.202 --> 32:45.272
I didn't kill anybody.
Leonard, don't.

32:45.305 --> 32:47.207
You're telling me,
to get out of here...

32:49.742 --> 32:51.878
...I got to show you
I'm a good man.

32:52.545 --> 32:54.347
And the only way to do that

32:54.381 --> 32:57.584
is to lie
and say I'm a killer.

32:58.185 --> 33:00.087
Well, I am not a killer!

33:00.120 --> 33:03.156
I am not a killer!

33:04.457 --> 33:05.792
Are you done?

33:05.825 --> 33:07.327
I am not done.

33:07.360 --> 33:09.362
You see...

33:09.396 --> 33:13.533
you have to make me
say I killed him,

33:13.566 --> 33:15.868
because otherwise,

33:15.902 --> 33:18.871
you have to face the fact

33:18.905 --> 33:22.342
that you've got an innocent man
sitting in jail

33:22.375 --> 33:26.213
for 12 years,
for something he didn't do.

33:27.347 --> 33:28.948
You just want to pretend

33:28.981 --> 33:31.284
you only got guilty people
in prison.

33:31.318 --> 33:33.686
Mr. Marshall,
I warn you--

33:33.720 --> 33:35.588
You warn me what?

33:35.622 --> 33:38.058
That I'm not
going to get parole?

33:38.091 --> 33:40.827
I was never going
to get parole.

33:42.362 --> 33:43.696
Not from you.

33:48.501 --> 33:51.138
You know, it's a joke.

33:51.704 --> 33:53.706
A damn joke.

33:56.976 --> 33:58.511
Now, I'm done.

34:09.255 --> 34:11.924
Rule 48 says I can make
an oral motion

34:11.958 --> 34:13.193
for an emergency stay.

34:13.226 --> 34:14.594
Yeah, wait a second.

34:14.627 --> 34:16.496
Your client wants
to be executed.

34:16.529 --> 34:18.797
Because he was brainwashed
by his lawyer.

34:19.831 --> 34:21.333
Are you serious?

34:21.368 --> 34:23.703
Your Honor,
I really believe it's true.

34:23.735 --> 34:25.472
I've been a friend
of John Mockler's for a long--

34:25.505 --> 34:27.639
If John Mockler didn't want
to help somebody,

34:27.674 --> 34:30.543
why wouldn't he just decline
to take the case?

34:30.577 --> 34:33.380
Are you suggesting
he took on clients

34:33.413 --> 34:36.683
for the purpose of securing
their executions?

34:37.750 --> 34:39.119
Possibly, yes.

34:40.020 --> 34:41.487
Why?

34:41.521 --> 34:44.824
Well, he has cases
he wants heard

34:44.857 --> 34:46.859
at the appellate level
at the Supreme Court.

34:46.893 --> 34:48.761
Because those courts
are inundated

34:48.795 --> 34:50.230
with so many futile
baseless appeals,

34:50.263 --> 34:53.266
a lot of deserving cases get
thrown out with the bath water.

34:53.300 --> 34:56.735
So I think he takes cases
to weed them.

34:56.768 --> 34:59.072
If there's anything remotely
redeeming about a client,

34:59.106 --> 35:00.840
or there's police misconduct,

35:00.873 --> 35:02.709
or the guy could possibly
be innocent,

35:02.742 --> 35:04.077
he goes to the mat.

35:04.111 --> 35:05.778
For the scumballs,

35:05.812 --> 35:09.249
they all find God
and waive final appeals.

35:09.282 --> 35:13.920
He is deciding who's entitled
to a defense and who's not.

35:15.655 --> 35:17.057
On the record before me,

35:17.090 --> 35:20.693
Mr. Mockler has committed
no malpractice.

35:20.727 --> 35:24.064
And there is no evidence
of any mental defect

35:24.097 --> 35:26.366
on the part
of Walter Dawson.

35:26.399 --> 35:29.636
Can you stay the execution
for a week,

35:29.669 --> 35:31.504
to at least take a look?

35:34.006 --> 35:35.475
No.

35:36.843 --> 35:39.812
But I...
I salute your innovation.

35:39.846 --> 35:42.149
I mean, this is--
this is a new one.

35:43.450 --> 35:45.752
Is John Mockler behind this?

35:47.320 --> 35:49.756
No, he isn't.

35:53.160 --> 35:54.794
Declare him incompetent?

35:54.827 --> 35:56.196
It's all I can think of.

35:56.229 --> 35:57.897
I mean, you should have
seen him, Jimmy.

35:57.930 --> 36:00.067
He-- he sounded
almost deranged.

36:00.100 --> 36:03.770
But he's still
legally competent.

36:03.803 --> 36:06.339
Ellenor,
we're at a dead end.

36:06.373 --> 36:08.375
There's nothing more
we can do.

36:08.408 --> 36:10.077
(footsteps approaching)

36:15.115 --> 36:17.084
So you went to see Keith

36:17.117 --> 36:19.052
and told him
what I said to you.

36:19.086 --> 36:20.320
Why don't you sue me?

36:20.353 --> 36:22.622
Ellenor, if you go
any further with this,

36:22.655 --> 36:25.525
I will very much sue you.
Count on that.

36:25.558 --> 36:28.995
Marcia, sooner or later,

36:29.029 --> 36:31.364
you're gonna make
a mistake.

36:32.865 --> 36:35.001
Well, for now,

36:35.035 --> 36:37.504
you'll have to wait
until that happens.

36:37.537 --> 36:41.007
I will.
You can count on that.

36:48.581 --> 36:52.352
The fact is, parole
is a political process.

36:52.385 --> 36:54.887
A man convicted of murder
wants to be released.

36:54.921 --> 36:57.090
If you deny that request,
nothing happens,

36:57.124 --> 36:58.625
but if you grant it,

36:58.658 --> 37:01.128
there's always a chance
he might kill again.

37:01.161 --> 37:03.063
Nobody needs that pressure,

37:03.096 --> 37:04.731
nobody wants that guilt,

37:04.764 --> 37:06.499
nobody's looking
for a public scandal,

37:06.533 --> 37:09.269
so, yes, you could give
my client a fair hearing,

37:09.302 --> 37:11.571
but bottom line--
what's in it for you?

37:11.604 --> 37:14.574
Are you saying we're
corrupt, Mr. Young?

37:14.607 --> 37:17.910
I'm saying that what
we've forgotten somehow

37:17.944 --> 37:19.512
is that this is a man--

37:19.546 --> 37:22.182
a man who has fought
to better himself,

37:22.215 --> 37:24.851
a man who has done his time
with grace and dignity,

37:24.884 --> 37:27.087
a man who deserves
to be released,

37:27.120 --> 37:29.322
but because there is
no political upside,

37:29.356 --> 37:32.059
you won't take the time
to figure that out.

37:32.092 --> 37:33.993
Now, I admit
that a lot of these inmates

37:34.027 --> 37:35.428
probably should be rejected,

37:35.462 --> 37:37.530
but what about the few
who shouldn't be?

37:37.564 --> 37:40.500
Yes, Leonard Marshall
claims to be innocent,

37:40.533 --> 37:42.735
and what if he actually is?

37:42.769 --> 37:45.438
With new technology,
with the use of DNA,

37:45.472 --> 37:47.074
we know for a fact

37:47.107 --> 37:49.842
that innocent people
do get convicted.

37:49.876 --> 37:53.413
This is not a forum
to retry your client's guilt
or innocence.

37:53.446 --> 37:56.849
My client wants
to go home.

37:56.883 --> 37:58.851
He could have lied.

37:58.885 --> 38:00.187
He could have come in here

38:00.220 --> 38:02.855
and said exactly what
you wanted to hear.

38:02.889 --> 38:04.824
But instead
he risked everything--

38:05.358 --> 38:07.660
the chance to go home
with his wife and son--

38:07.694 --> 38:10.130
because he wouldn't give away

38:10.163 --> 38:13.133
the only thing
that kept his family sane

38:13.166 --> 38:15.235
for the last 12 years--

38:15.268 --> 38:18.971
the fact that he is innocent.

38:21.308 --> 38:23.776
This may not be the forum
to prove it...

38:24.611 --> 38:26.813
but don't tell me
it's not relevant.

38:29.882 --> 38:32.585
This is Leonard Marshall's
family.

38:32.619 --> 38:34.621
They were there
the day he was taken away,

38:34.654 --> 38:35.988
and they are here now,

38:36.023 --> 38:38.125
asking you
to please give him back.

38:38.158 --> 38:40.127
Take this chance.

38:40.160 --> 38:44.297
Prove that you're
motivated by justice,
not politics.

38:44.331 --> 38:47.567
Prove that you care
about people,
not publicity.

38:47.600 --> 38:51.871
Prove that this board
can be feared but still fair.

38:53.005 --> 38:55.142
That's what Leonard
Marshall wants.

38:59.679 --> 39:01.114
It's what he deserves.

39:13.693 --> 39:14.927
Thanks.

39:17.397 --> 39:19.099
Viv...

39:19.899 --> 39:21.434
James, I, um...

39:23.970 --> 39:27.474
I know you're very angry
with me right now, and...

39:30.010 --> 39:32.512
But I, uh... I just--

39:38.585 --> 39:40.220
(door opens)

39:41.154 --> 39:42.255
We're ready.

39:48.695 --> 39:49.996
Six minutes.

39:53.933 --> 39:57.937
For the purposes of this
hearing and our decision,

39:57.970 --> 40:02.475
we must presume the defendant
to be guilty as convicted.

40:02.509 --> 40:05.945
That said,
we're faced today

40:05.978 --> 40:08.748
with a man who committed murder,

40:08.781 --> 40:14.287
who still refuses to accept
responsibility for his crime.

40:14.321 --> 40:17.657
I have never heard
of any parole board

40:17.690 --> 40:21.028
granting release
under such a circumstance.

40:25.532 --> 40:27.834
So today would be a first.

40:29.769 --> 40:31.271
By majority vote...

40:32.772 --> 40:35.875
Mr. Leonard Marshall's
petition for release...

40:37.077 --> 40:38.545
...is granted.

40:42.115 --> 40:43.383
We are adjourned.

40:54.927 --> 40:56.629
Granted now?

40:58.231 --> 40:59.566
Pretty much.

41:10.343 --> 41:11.844
Oh, my God.

41:37.937 --> 41:40.140
[LAUGHING]

41:53.553 --> 41:54.654
Still here?

41:55.922 --> 41:58.025
Yeah. I didn't feel
like going home.

42:01.561 --> 42:03.563
Has it happened yet?

42:03.596 --> 42:06.599
Any minute, I guess.
I have it on.

42:10.803 --> 42:12.004
You did all you could.

42:13.773 --> 42:14.974
Here it is.

42:15.007 --> 42:16.809
...the sentence of death
was carried out

42:16.843 --> 42:18.145
upon Walter Dawson.

42:18.178 --> 42:21.614
The procedure was
initiated at 12:09.

42:21.648 --> 42:24.217
Death was pronounced at 12:23.

42:24.251 --> 42:26.253
His final words were
to ask forgiveness

42:26.286 --> 42:28.821
from the victim's family.

42:28.855 --> 42:31.158
-And from God.
-(exhales)

42:31.191 --> 42:33.060
That's all. Thank you.

42:34.561 --> 42:36.396
REPORTER: That was
Warden John Hauser,

42:36.429 --> 42:39.832
and now we are switching
to attorney John Mockler.

42:40.667 --> 42:45.238
As surely as Walter Dawson
committed an act of murder,

42:45.272 --> 42:47.840
so did our federal government
this night.

42:48.741 --> 42:51.578
Our country charges
all over the world,

42:51.611 --> 42:54.214
declaring itself a champion
of human rights.

42:54.247 --> 42:59.819
I ask you,
from where do we derive
our moral integrity?

43:01.421 --> 43:03.756
Learned Hand,
you know, he said,

43:03.790 --> 43:06.859
"Liberty lies in our hearts.

43:08.561 --> 43:10.797
And once it dies there,

43:10.830 --> 43:13.366
no constitution can save it."

43:15.535 --> 43:18.705
I might suggest
the same would be true

43:18.738 --> 43:20.040
for humanity.

43:34.721 --> 43:38.325
(music playing)

44:00.780 --> 44:02.015
You stinker!
