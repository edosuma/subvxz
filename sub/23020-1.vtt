WEBVTT

00:07.257 --> 00:10.301
[scribbling]

00:11.136 --> 00:12.220
[man]  Shitty pen...

00:12.303 --> 00:13.805
Shitty, shitty pen, pen,

00:13.888 --> 00:14.806
we hate you.

00:15.890 --> 00:20.353
Uh... Mike's meeting two:
the outline.

00:21.604 --> 00:24.274
Projecting power,
confidence, talk fast.

00:24.482 --> 00:26.443
Talk fast,
easy, and project.

00:27.777 --> 00:29.195
Why do you think I'm here?

00:29.279 --> 00:30.405
No. Why do you
think I'm here?

00:30.488 --> 00:32.073
I want a career.
I want--

00:32.156 --> 00:33.867
I want a career
and I want some coin,

00:33.950 --> 00:35.035
and I want to
find the people

00:35.118 --> 00:36.244
who can make
that happen...

00:36.327 --> 00:37.370
make that  happen.

00:37.454 --> 00:39.205
I'm here
because I like you.

00:39.789 --> 00:42.250
[fingers snapping]
Okay. Okay. Okay.

00:43.334 --> 00:44.794
You know, guys,
this is my project.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.880
Every little part of
this project is me.

00:46.963 --> 00:48.673
I write, storyboard, cast...

00:48.757 --> 00:51.009
I edited, composed,
I did the musical score.

00:51.092 --> 00:52.761
If it's  Gray State,  it's mine.

00:52.844 --> 00:54.345
Yes, yes.

00:55.180 --> 00:57.974
And suddenly  Gray State
is a household name.

00:58.058 --> 00:59.642
Gray State  is already
a household name.

01:00.351 --> 01:02.937
Every time I poke this dragon,
they all fire awake

01:03.021 --> 01:05.230
saying things like
"You guys are the best."

01:05.315 --> 01:07.734
"Keep it up,
in the name of liberty."

01:09.027 --> 01:11.029
And blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

01:11.112 --> 01:12.405
People love this movie.

01:12.489 --> 01:13.948
The things that
we could do with this.

01:14.032 --> 01:15.825
The things that
we could  do  with this.

01:15.909 --> 01:16.826
[scribbling]

01:16.910 --> 01:18.244
Okay, there's your break.

01:18.328 --> 01:20.080
Shift to sincere.

01:21.247 --> 01:22.749
So you're saying
30 million?

01:22.832 --> 01:24.793
Honestly, I think
we can do better.

01:24.876 --> 01:26.127
"I think."
"I think."

01:26.211 --> 01:28.213
Because that implies
I've got my own ideas.

01:28.296 --> 01:29.130
"I think."

01:29.214 --> 01:31.007
So, can we do better?
No, don't say that.

01:31.090 --> 01:32.509
Don't put in
the negative "Can we?"

01:32.592 --> 01:34.928
We can. We can...
We can do better.

01:35.011 --> 01:36.137
[scribbling]

01:36.221 --> 01:37.555
I'm here
because I like you...

01:37.722 --> 01:40.183
but I want our film
to be made right.

01:40.517 --> 01:41.684
[scribbling]

01:41.893 --> 01:42.769
Hmm.

01:44.646 --> 01:47.232
Pen is broken...

01:48.483 --> 01:50.193
There we go.

01:51.194 --> 01:52.946
[soft music playing]

02:29.399 --> 02:30.608
[David Crowley]
Thank you for coming out.

02:30.817 --> 02:33.444
As you know, this is
an independent project.

02:33.528 --> 02:37.157
We have a quadcopter drone,
we're gonna be doing aerials,

02:37.240 --> 02:39.450
we're gonna have you guys
busting up these houses,

02:39.534 --> 02:42.829
uh, siccing attack dogs
on children...

02:42.912 --> 02:44.414
[chuckles]
it's gonna get nasty.

02:44.747 --> 02:47.208
And, uh, thank you guys
for being a part of it,

02:47.292 --> 02:49.377
I hope you have
the presence of mind

02:49.460 --> 02:52.505
to remain professional
and not take it too far.

02:52.589 --> 02:55.049
It's just I don't know
what "too far" really is
at this point.

02:55.133 --> 02:56.634
[laughter]

02:56.718 --> 02:58.553
So just impress me,
make it real.

02:58.636 --> 02:59.888
You're here for
a reason, right?

02:59.971 --> 03:01.222
You're part of
the  Gray State  Team.

03:01.806 --> 03:02.849
Big family.

03:02.932 --> 03:03.808
Show it to me.

03:03.892 --> 03:04.851
Big family.

03:04.934 --> 03:05.810
Anything else?

03:05.894 --> 03:06.895
I think we're covered.

03:07.562 --> 03:09.314
[drone buzzing]

03:11.357 --> 03:13.943
Squad leaders,
I wanna hear you
yelling to your guys.

03:14.277 --> 03:15.278
Give a command.

03:15.361 --> 03:16.446
If they're doing
something wrong,

03:16.529 --> 03:17.697
get them into play.

03:17.780 --> 03:18.948
That's your target house.

03:19.490 --> 03:20.825
High-value individual
in there.

03:20.909 --> 03:22.243
Very dangerous,
he's armed.

03:22.827 --> 03:24.954
Get there!
Get your squad up there!

03:25.038 --> 03:26.539
Oh, "Get there."

03:26.664 --> 03:28.291
So David had
a saying all the time.

03:28.374 --> 03:29.709
He'd scream,
"Get there! Get there!"

03:29.792 --> 03:31.502
And David only
showed you one time

03:31.586 --> 03:34.255
how to do something
and he hated if
you had to go back

03:34.339 --> 03:35.673
and ask questions about it.

03:36.549 --> 03:37.675
Action!

03:38.051 --> 03:39.594
[man] SWAT team! Hit it!

03:40.011 --> 03:41.888
Go, go, go, go!

03:44.515 --> 03:46.017
[David] Okay, cut, cut, cut!

03:46.100 --> 03:47.018
[dog barking]

03:48.770 --> 03:49.604
Wow.

03:52.023 --> 03:53.566
[woman] 42 people left so far.

03:53.650 --> 03:54.734
-How many?
-[woman] 42.

03:54.817 --> 03:56.486
-It's 43.
-[woman] Oh, 43.

03:56.569 --> 03:57.487
Hey, guys,
how's it going?

03:57.570 --> 03:59.197
I'm losing my voice
so I'll make this quick.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.408
Right now we're
getting to the fun stuff.

04:02.492 --> 04:03.993
This is the actual  Gray State.

04:04.077 --> 04:06.621
You guys have seen
the trailer, obviously,
you know

04:07.121 --> 04:09.582
this is just
a quick jump
into the future.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.126
[Rani]  Watch this, Daddy!

04:12.210 --> 04:13.795
Watch this, Daddy!

04:14.837 --> 04:16.089
[David] Okay,
I'm watching.

04:16.172 --> 04:18.091
Watch this, Daddy.

04:18.173 --> 04:19.341
I'm right here,
I'm watching.

04:19.425 --> 04:21.177
[Rani humming]

04:21.261 --> 04:22.971
Even in the midst of it,
David always took time

04:23.054 --> 04:24.305
to acknowledge
his daughter.

04:25.014 --> 04:26.766
[David laughs]
You're a goofball.

04:28.768 --> 04:31.020
[laughing]

04:32.939 --> 04:34.899
It's interesting
being here on this set

04:34.983 --> 04:36.317
because this set here,

04:36.401 --> 04:37.860
where we're
shooting this interview,

04:37.944 --> 04:39.904
is where we did a lot of
the shooting for  Gray State.

04:40.238 --> 04:41.322
[David] Action.

04:42.490 --> 04:44.117
If you are receiving
this message,

04:44.200 --> 04:45.743
then you've
been recruited.

04:45.952 --> 04:47.662
Welcome to the fight, Patriot.

04:48.746 --> 04:50.665
[David] Okay, a little bit
less on the happy.

04:50.748 --> 04:51.958
[Danny]
Less, okay.

04:52.250 --> 04:53.835
[interviewer]
What is  Gray State?

04:57.839 --> 04:59.465
[ominous music]

04:59.549 --> 05:01.134
[helicopter whirring]

05:04.846 --> 05:06.639
...Every enemy
of the State!

05:06.723 --> 05:10.435
Gray State  is
less a movie
than it is a warning.

05:12.770 --> 05:14.731
We do not live
in a dictatorship,

05:14.814 --> 05:16.316
but we do live
in a police state.

05:19.152 --> 05:21.237
What we're gonna
see is the unveiling

05:21.321 --> 05:25.700
of this gray state
foisted upon America.

05:27.994 --> 05:30.204
The thing that you have
to begin to understand

05:30.288 --> 05:32.165
about conspiracy theory is that

05:33.916 --> 05:36.335
at some points,
it's no longer a theory.

05:37.628 --> 05:38.546
No!

05:39.839 --> 05:41.257
You talk about
Peak Oil.

05:41.340 --> 05:42.675
You talk about
FEMA camps.

05:43.468 --> 05:45.386
You talk about
global warming.

05:45.511 --> 05:48.598
You talk about the UN.
You talk about the NWO.

05:48.931 --> 05:50.308
They're prepping
for megadeath.

05:51.100 --> 05:52.101
[screaming]

05:52.185 --> 05:54.312
[reporter] ...Last night's
declaration of martial law.

05:54.395 --> 05:56.064
[David]  Once the red carpet
gets rolled out

05:56.147 --> 05:57.899
for this
New World Order program,

05:58.608 --> 06:00.068
everything is free game.

06:00.818 --> 06:01.861
The bastard of it all

06:01.944 --> 06:03.112
is that you've
heard of everything.

06:09.577 --> 06:11.788
Americans believe that
they can't do anything,

06:12.038 --> 06:13.372
and day by day,

06:13.456 --> 06:14.749
they're becoming correct.

06:17.919 --> 06:19.003
[all yelling]

06:19.754 --> 06:22.590
It's a game of numbers
and, uh, we're losing.

06:23.466 --> 06:25.843
-[gunfire]
-[helicopters whirring]

06:31.015 --> 06:33.101
[protesters chanting]
End the Fed! End the Fed!

06:33.184 --> 06:37.855
End the Fed!
End the Fed!

06:42.443 --> 06:43.986
I want to salute
everybody that came out

06:44.070 --> 06:46.614
to address the real elite,
the robber barons

06:46.697 --> 06:47.949
that have taken
over our society.

06:48.032 --> 06:49.992
These are cowardly scum!

06:50.159 --> 06:51.369
All right,
get down there, folks.

06:51.452 --> 06:52.829
March down there
and get 'em!

06:52.912 --> 06:54.789
Come on! I'm gonna
get the other people.

06:54.997 --> 06:57.917
[sirens]

06:59.043 --> 07:01.212
[Sean] Hey, Alex.
Can we lock in a time
with you tomorrow for...

07:01.879 --> 07:03.297
I'll be out here like
9:00 in the morning.

07:03.381 --> 07:04.590
What are you guys
doing at 10:00?

07:04.674 --> 07:05.967
[David] You know
that dystopian movie

07:06.050 --> 07:07.385
you're always
talking about on air?

07:07.468 --> 07:08.928
-Yeah.
-[David] We're
the only ones doing it.

07:09.137 --> 07:11.347
So it's what happens
if these guys win.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.599
And it's the dystopian
near-future reality

07:13.683 --> 07:15.601
we're looking at if we
don't embrace liberty.

07:15.685 --> 07:17.186
-Oh, that's what's
called "gray state."
-Yeah.

07:17.395 --> 07:20.440
David didn't want to be
the leader for anything.

07:20.523 --> 07:22.358
He didn't want
the glamour, the glory,

07:22.442 --> 07:23.526
the millions of dollars.

07:23.776 --> 07:25.611
He saw a vision,
he wanted to make it work,

07:25.695 --> 07:26.863
and he wanted
to get it out.

07:27.029 --> 07:29.407
The  Gray State  movie,
go to graystatemovie.com.

07:29.490 --> 07:30.908
We're on Facebook,
we're on Youtube.

07:30.992 --> 07:32.785
The word is getting out
and the war is coming.

07:32.910 --> 07:34.996
David Crowley was
a voice for a movement

07:35.079 --> 07:38.749
that believed that
a government shutdown
was imminent.

07:38.958 --> 07:43.880
That the oligarchy and
these corporate powers,

07:43.963 --> 07:44.922
the Corporatocracy,

07:45.006 --> 07:47.717
could overtake
our civilization,

07:47.800 --> 07:51.137
our society,
and in turn, our citizens,

07:51.220 --> 07:53.848
and take away
all of our civil liberties

07:53.931 --> 07:54.974
and human rights.

07:57.518 --> 07:59.645
If you look around,
this reminds me of Iraq.

07:59.729 --> 08:01.105
You've got
the gradual decline

08:01.189 --> 08:02.273
of freedom and liberty.

08:02.356 --> 08:03.733
Uh, that's the gray state.

08:05.526 --> 08:06.944
[Joseph Seaton]
He's a genius.

08:08.321 --> 08:09.322
He  was  a genius.

08:09.405 --> 08:13.409
Um, I had never met
anybody so analytical,

08:13.493 --> 08:17.747
uh, so decisive
and so strategic.

08:17.997 --> 08:19.123
[David] Thanks for coming.

08:19.207 --> 08:21.292
It's important to note
that without
the volunteered participation

08:21.375 --> 08:23.586
of people like you to
give the project scale,

08:23.669 --> 08:26.422
all the best ideas
and loftiest ambitions

08:26.506 --> 08:27.632
would never be realized.

08:27.965 --> 08:29.258
This is not
just a movie.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.177
Today we are all part of
something much bigger.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.679
[applause]

08:33.763 --> 08:35.222
[Mason Hendricks]
A lot of people,
when they look at David,

08:35.306 --> 08:37.725
they could think
why does he make
everything so difficult,

08:37.808 --> 08:39.309
so challenging,
and so tough?

08:39.684 --> 08:42.980
And probably
the easiest answer is

08:43.063 --> 08:44.524
because he was
a perfectionist.

08:45.858 --> 08:47.360
[Mitch] What the fuck
is this wall

08:47.485 --> 08:48.528
and how does it work?

08:49.445 --> 08:53.533
So, um, the wall is
just a writing tool.

08:53.616 --> 08:55.701
The wall is something that
every writer probably does.

08:55.785 --> 08:57.328
I don't know how
extensive they get.

08:57.411 --> 08:59.580
Maybe they're better
at synthesizing story
than I am.

09:00.289 --> 09:03.000
So, I mean,
if you want to look
at it physically,

09:03.084 --> 09:05.711
you have the story
here, beginning to end.

09:05.795 --> 09:07.880
Also top to bottom.

09:08.172 --> 09:10.341
So, uh, in constructing
a story you'll find out

09:10.424 --> 09:11.926
that it works on
several levels.

09:12.009 --> 09:13.427
There's mythological
storytelling,

09:13.511 --> 09:14.470
so it's the hero's journey

09:14.554 --> 09:16.556
as described by
Joseph Campbell.

09:17.974 --> 09:20.017
[David]  Well, this
whole thing has sort of

09:20.101 --> 09:21.686
taken on a mind of its own.

09:21.936 --> 09:24.063
We're still pretty new
to this whole gig,

09:24.564 --> 09:26.357
but, you know,
it is developing.

09:26.440 --> 09:28.484
This project has
developed momentum

09:28.568 --> 09:29.694
that I can't
even describe.

09:29.777 --> 09:30.861
It has run away from us.

09:31.112 --> 09:31.988
[David] Action!

09:32.196 --> 09:34.615
[grunting and shouting]

09:36.158 --> 09:37.535
Okay, so head
in your crotch?

09:37.618 --> 09:38.744
Bloody head
in your crotch?

09:38.828 --> 09:39.745
[chuckling]

09:39.829 --> 09:42.123
Hi, Chris Peck.
Nice to meet you.

09:42.206 --> 09:43.207
[Danny] Slate.

09:44.083 --> 09:45.001
[David] Action!

09:45.084 --> 09:46.335
[loud grunt]

09:48.921 --> 09:50.256
[laughter]

09:50.339 --> 09:52.049
[Chris Peck]  I think
what made David a good leader

09:52.133 --> 09:54.385
was probably what
he picked up, uh,

09:54.468 --> 09:56.304
through his experience
of the Army.

09:56.387 --> 09:57.430
[David] Cameras
are rolling.

09:59.015 --> 10:00.600
[Chris]  He would
lead his crew

10:00.683 --> 10:03.769
like we were going
into war and, you know,

10:03.853 --> 10:05.396
we might not
come out alive.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.857
[crowd yelling]

10:07.940 --> 10:08.983
[David] Cut!

10:09.984 --> 10:13.446
[Chris]  Who else could
walk up to a group
of 20 people and say,

10:13.529 --> 10:15.531
"Hey, you wanna be
actors in this scene?"

10:15.615 --> 10:17.325
People who had
no experience at all,

10:17.700 --> 10:19.535
David would make
them into actors.

10:19.619 --> 10:20.828
You gotta be
leaning forward more,

10:22.079 --> 10:23.331
shoot this arm back.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.666
Just start there.
Okay, cool.

10:25.750 --> 10:26.751
Here we go!
Here we go!

10:27.043 --> 10:28.628
If you guys want
to be in a scene,

10:28.711 --> 10:29.920
Chief Weinzel told me that

10:30.504 --> 10:32.632
I can do whatever
I want with you guys

10:32.715 --> 10:34.050
as long as
you're cool with it.

10:34.133 --> 10:35.051
[chuckling]

10:35.801 --> 10:37.637
So if you want to jump out
and join the squads

10:37.720 --> 10:38.846
and make a show of it,

10:38.929 --> 10:40.097
I'm cool with that
if you are.

10:40.264 --> 10:42.433
I wanna get away
with as much as I can,

10:43.184 --> 10:44.602
so if I can have
a snarling dog

10:44.685 --> 10:47.480
attack a family, safely,
I'm gonna do that.

10:47.772 --> 10:49.982
And you guys
have to tell me "no."

10:50.399 --> 10:52.652
David very much
had a vision

10:52.735 --> 10:55.404
when it came to
making  Gray State.

10:55.613 --> 10:56.697
Action!

10:56.864 --> 10:58.949
[Chris]  He knew how
to be a businessman,

10:59.075 --> 11:00.910
he knew how to
get people together.

11:00.993 --> 11:02.286
They were not filmmakers.

11:02.370 --> 11:03.496
[David] All right, cut.

11:04.372 --> 11:06.123
-[Komel] But what's-
-[David] Kelly, I can't.

11:06.207 --> 11:07.958
You might die. Like,
we talked about this.

11:08.042 --> 11:10.628
Yeah... which is good
'cause it's like repeating

11:10.711 --> 11:11.921
a conversation we
would have had before.

11:12.004 --> 11:13.255
But what's Kelly's
motivation to get taken out,

11:13.339 --> 11:17.093
because she knows
that Josh kept her
off the radar, right?

11:17.301 --> 11:19.553
[Danny]  David and Komel
were always one unit.

11:19.762 --> 11:21.847
I mean, they were...
they were incredible.

11:21.931 --> 11:24.266
They were a relationship
you wished for.

11:24.475 --> 11:26.977
You could have a bear
in there, a bear figurine.

11:27.061 --> 11:28.604
Doesn't have to be figurines.

11:28.687 --> 11:30.314
-Cherub figurines.
-[both laughing]

11:30.731 --> 11:32.691
They always had their
own interesting way

11:32.775 --> 11:34.402
to express how much
they loved each other.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.154
Yeah, that's better.

11:37.822 --> 11:39.240
-Or just--
-You're fidgeting
over there.

11:39.323 --> 11:40.449
No, I'm not.
I'm just laughing.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.034
I'm glad this isn't
being narrated.

11:42.118 --> 11:44.412
"Daniel feels
a lump in his pocket
from the expo"

11:44.495 --> 11:45.704
could mean a lot of things.

11:46.163 --> 11:48.541
[laughing]

11:48.624 --> 11:50.334
So I'm glad
no one's narrating it.

11:52.837 --> 11:54.004
"Expo."

11:58.717 --> 12:00.469
[interviewer]
Tell me about Komel
a little bit.

12:03.639 --> 12:04.723
Um...

12:09.311 --> 12:10.229
sorry.

12:31.750 --> 12:33.961
[Judy Prochnow]  Well,
you can't help
but think about it

12:34.044 --> 12:35.713
every time
you drive past it

12:35.796 --> 12:39.633
or just coming out
in the backyard
and looking over.

12:41.302 --> 12:44.263
And, um, the people
I have talked to,

12:44.388 --> 12:46.640
we would all just be
happy if someone came

12:46.724 --> 12:49.810
and tore it down and
built something new.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.983
We had my sister-in-law
living with us

12:56.066 --> 12:57.860
for the month of December,

12:58.486 --> 13:00.488
and, um, we took her home

13:00.571 --> 13:02.615
in the first part
of January.

13:03.157 --> 13:06.160
And as we were
driving to the airport
that morning,

13:06.410 --> 13:09.914
I, um, looked at the steps

13:10.164 --> 13:13.918
and I noticed
there were still
Christmas gifts out there,

13:14.668 --> 13:17.087
and we had assumed
that they went to Texas.

13:18.964 --> 13:20.883
[Collin Prochnow] I went over
to pick up the presents

13:20.966 --> 13:22.468
and then
I heard the dog bark.

13:22.551 --> 13:25.346
Aand I hadn't heard
the dog bark for a long time,

13:25.554 --> 13:28.974
so I thought, "Well, they,
uh, they must be home."

13:29.350 --> 13:30.684
And since I was in the front,

13:30.809 --> 13:32.144
I went to ring the doorbell.

13:32.228 --> 13:34.063
Well, then the dog came
and jumped up

13:34.146 --> 13:37.525
by the, uh, front window
and was barking,

13:37.608 --> 13:40.986
and I thought, "Well,
they're not home.

13:41.070 --> 13:44.490
I hadn't seen the dog
or heard the dog before,

13:44.573 --> 13:46.742
maybe there might
be something wrong."

13:48.536 --> 13:51.080
And that's when
I stepped off the stoop

13:51.163 --> 13:53.916
and went over
to the window
and I looked inside.

13:56.293 --> 13:59.296
I saw one body
that was probably...

13:59.964 --> 14:03.259
oh, maybe about six
to eight feet away
from the window.

14:03.509 --> 14:06.845
And then I noticed that
there was another body

14:06.929 --> 14:10.933
maybe six to seven feet
away from the first one.

14:11.225 --> 14:13.769
And I noticed that
there was a little body

14:13.852 --> 14:15.646
that looked like
it was almost

14:15.729 --> 14:18.482
in the second body's arms.

14:22.903 --> 14:24.905
1055 Ramsdell Drive.

14:25.239 --> 14:28.367
House reporting
suspicious behavior next door.

14:28.617 --> 14:31.412
Went over to the home,
to the right of the RP,

14:31.495 --> 14:34.373
sees dead bodies inside
the house, dog inside,

14:34.456 --> 14:36.166
sees a gun in the house
on the floor.

14:39.211 --> 14:40.713
[Tom Lyden]  To look
at the three of them

14:40.796 --> 14:42.882
through the Instagram
filter of life,

14:42.965 --> 14:45.593
it's hard to imagine
how it all went so wrong.

14:46.302 --> 14:49.972
David Crowley,
a talented, promising
young filmmaker,

14:50.306 --> 14:53.475
his smart and beautiful wife,
Komel, a dietitian,

14:53.767 --> 14:57.021
and their adorable
five-year-old
daughter, Raniya.

14:57.479 --> 14:59.523
The reality is, the truth
of what happened

14:59.607 --> 15:01.191
to David Crowley
and his family

15:01.275 --> 15:04.403
is stranger and sadder
than anyone imagined.

15:12.161 --> 15:14.079
So this is the home
in Apple Valley.

15:16.624 --> 15:20.419
I mean, this is a total
middle class neighborhood.

15:23.172 --> 15:25.549
And this was
mid-January

15:25.633 --> 15:28.177
when police, uh,
made the discovery.

15:28.260 --> 15:30.888
You can still see
the Christmas presents
on the front porch.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.730
But what a horrific
crime to walk into

15:39.813 --> 15:41.231
and try to piece together.

15:41.690 --> 15:44.109
Physical evidence
scattered all over
by the dog.

15:44.193 --> 15:45.569
I mean, horrific.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.870
Investigators found
about 22 terabytes
of information

15:54.954 --> 15:56.538
all strung together
on hard drives,

15:56.622 --> 15:58.332
kind of daisy-chained
all together.

16:00.834 --> 16:03.462
And you had to think
that when they're
looking at all this,

16:03.545 --> 16:05.756
they're like, "Okay,
maybe the answer

16:05.839 --> 16:08.467
is in one of these
hard drives. We find
the "'why.'"

16:15.265 --> 16:16.308
So I took the case file.

16:16.392 --> 16:18.978
It was about
1,200-1,500 pages,

16:19.395 --> 16:20.479
and I went through it,

16:20.562 --> 16:22.064
and all of a sudden,
I came to a picture...

16:22.189 --> 16:23.774
A picture that
they did not have

16:23.941 --> 16:25.818
in the crime scene photos
that they provided.

16:26.777 --> 16:30.030
And I said,
"Oh, my God, what is this?"

16:32.992 --> 16:35.369
And there on the wall,
above the bodies,

16:35.661 --> 16:39.623
scrawled in blood,
the words "Allah Akbar."

16:40.249 --> 16:42.459
"God is the greatest."

16:44.294 --> 16:45.629
Between their bodies,

16:45.838 --> 16:48.549
a Quran with
pages torn out,

16:48.882 --> 16:51.677
opened to a traditional
forgiveness prayer.

16:53.053 --> 16:55.222
In the home office
on a notepad,

16:55.472 --> 16:58.017
"Submit to Allah now."

17:01.520 --> 17:04.565
[Cory Zurowski]
How do you try to explain

17:04.647 --> 17:05.858
three deaths, you know,

17:05.941 --> 17:07.943
a husband and a wife
and their little girl?

17:09.278 --> 17:11.238
And you can't come up
with the answers, right?

17:11.320 --> 17:14.491
I mean, talk about
the various parts of it,

17:14.575 --> 17:15.951
you just can't
come up with answers.

17:16.410 --> 17:19.079
There's something about it
that just kind of gets on you

17:19.163 --> 17:22.458
and you just
can't wash it off.

17:25.127 --> 17:27.003
There's a Quran laying
amongst the bodies,

17:27.087 --> 17:28.338
there's blood
on the wall...

17:29.298 --> 17:31.050
David Crowley's
right on the verge of

17:31.133 --> 17:32.426
making it big, shall we say,

17:32.509 --> 17:36.180
or at least taking
a really big step in
getting beyond YouTube

17:36.263 --> 17:38.432
and actually
getting to a movie,

17:38.557 --> 17:40.267
to theaters everywhere.

17:43.353 --> 17:46.273
No wonder it was catnip
for conspiracy theorists.

17:47.274 --> 17:50.360
Hello, this is Dan Hennan
along with Greg Fernandez Jr

17:50.444 --> 17:52.780
for another installment of
the Crowley case updates.

17:52.863 --> 17:55.407
Today is June 4, 2016,

17:55.532 --> 17:57.534
and we got some updates
on the case.

17:57.618 --> 17:58.952
So how are you
doing today, Greg?

17:59.036 --> 17:59.953
I'm doing good.

18:00.037 --> 18:01.914
It's hot, but that's okay.

18:02.206 --> 18:03.248
Good. Good.

18:03.540 --> 18:06.627
I don't give a crap
about credibility at all.

18:06.710 --> 18:08.587
Credibility means
nothing to me.

18:09.713 --> 18:11.423
What I care
about is truth.

18:11.673 --> 18:12.716
I'm not in law enforcement.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.551
I don't have a background
in detective work,

18:14.635 --> 18:16.595
but how it happened,
I would say it's undetermined.

18:16.678 --> 18:19.389
You've got no suicide note,
there's no motive,

18:19.473 --> 18:21.058
and they went
out of their way,
they said that

18:21.141 --> 18:23.352
the blood test on the wall
written "Allah Akbar"

18:23.435 --> 18:25.145
was the blood of
Komel Crowley.

18:25.229 --> 18:27.648
-Right.
-Well, who wrote the blood?

18:27.898 --> 18:30.109
Once you get into
this wrong territory,

18:30.192 --> 18:32.319
once you start treading
into these waters,

18:32.444 --> 18:35.364
um, there is
a backlash against you

18:35.572 --> 18:38.575
by some shadow entity,
who knows what it is,

18:38.700 --> 18:41.453
but you start pushing
the wrong buttons

18:41.537 --> 18:44.039
to the elite, so to say,

18:44.123 --> 18:45.666
and there is payback.

18:50.629 --> 18:52.422
And I think
one of the big problems

18:52.506 --> 18:55.300
with the people
who think that
David Crowley is guilty,

18:55.384 --> 18:57.469
is they don't even want us
asking questions now.

18:57.594 --> 19:01.557
They don't decide
when we get to
stop asking questions.

19:01.640 --> 19:04.143
We get to decide that.

19:05.018 --> 19:08.188
Did the government
want to silence him
and his film?

19:08.730 --> 19:12.651
[Youtuber 1]  Guys out here
going after the truth
get knocked off.

19:13.110 --> 19:15.362
[Youtuber 2]
This particular video
really shows

19:15.445 --> 19:16.947
why the criminal establishment

19:17.030 --> 19:20.826
murdered not only him,
but his family as well.

19:21.243 --> 19:22.953
[Dan Hennan]
As the admin and creator

19:23.036 --> 19:26.540
of the justice pages
on the Facebook accounts,

19:26.623 --> 19:28.876
I allow all theories
to come into play.

19:28.959 --> 19:30.878
I don't want to
censor narratives.

19:30.961 --> 19:32.254
There are certain
people out there that

19:32.379 --> 19:34.923
certainly believe that
these things did happen.

19:35.132 --> 19:37.384
They ruled it
a double murder

19:37.467 --> 19:39.386
followed by a suicide
at the hands of David

19:39.469 --> 19:41.138
without any
real investigation.

19:41.388 --> 19:44.183
There was no signs
of domestic violence.

19:44.433 --> 19:47.561
There was no evidence
of a violent household.

19:48.061 --> 19:50.731
There was no
evidence of PTSD.

19:51.481 --> 19:54.443
There was no evidence
of mental illness.

19:54.735 --> 19:56.236
No depression,
nothing.

20:02.159 --> 20:03.952
[David]  There are certain
points in every story

20:04.036 --> 20:05.829
that you can recognize
that this is what happens

20:05.913 --> 20:07.539
to the character at
this point in the story.

20:07.623 --> 20:11.168
For example, um,
after Act 2 begins,

20:11.251 --> 20:14.129
eventually
the midpoint is created,

20:14.213 --> 20:16.215
which is the metaphorical
"inmost cave."

20:16.298 --> 20:19.551
So the hero enters
the labyrinth
to fight the Minotaur.

20:19.635 --> 20:21.637
And he emerges
with the secret,

20:21.720 --> 20:22.888
but the fight isn't over.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.765
And that applies to
other stories like

20:24.848 --> 20:27.517
the character doesn't
have the right idea yet,

20:27.601 --> 20:29.061
and is still kinda struggling,

20:29.144 --> 20:33.148
but he achieves progress
through proactivity
and all these things.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.484
And eventually there's
the supreme ordeal

20:35.776 --> 20:38.570
which, uh, is

his inner trauma.

33:00.311 --> 33:01.771
[David] Gray State
is shot everywhere,

33:01.854 --> 33:03.314
but mostly it's
shot in a studio.

33:05.316 --> 33:07.360
But you'd never know
looking at the footage.

33:08.528 --> 33:11.197
All this buzz
that people have
for  Gray State,

33:11.614 --> 33:12.532
we didn't start it.

33:13.825 --> 33:17.370
This story is-- I mean,
the farther down you go,

33:17.453 --> 33:18.538
the story becomes bigger

33:18.621 --> 33:19.998
and it involves
more people.

33:20.248 --> 33:23.501
It involves generations
and generations of Americans

33:23.584 --> 33:25.086
and everyone else
playing their part

33:25.169 --> 33:26.671
leading up to
this moment.

33:26.754 --> 33:29.132
So, yes, I mean,
once you begin to
connect these dots,

33:29.215 --> 33:32.010
there's no way you can't
tell a story about it.

33:33.845 --> 33:35.763
He was introduced
to the idea.

33:35.847 --> 33:38.599
It started out as
a fun little fantasy,

33:38.850 --> 33:40.435
and then I think it
kind of snowballed

33:40.518 --> 33:43.271
and got bigger than
he had imagined it would.

33:43.354 --> 33:44.689
[David]
Okay, Mitch.

33:45.148 --> 33:46.024
Yeah.

33:46.107 --> 33:46.983
[David] Go to mark down?

33:47.066 --> 33:50.570
[Mitch Heil]  He had a very
"take control" personality.

33:50.653 --> 33:53.322
And I think I almost got
like, submissive of it.

33:53.406 --> 33:55.491
After I had seen
the results, I'm like,

33:55.575 --> 33:57.326
"Well, I didn't agree
with you, but holy shit,

33:57.410 --> 34:00.079
this looks good, so
I'm gonna go with it."

34:00.163 --> 34:01.039
Okay, I'm gonna be frank.

34:01.122 --> 34:03.249
This is a public execution.

34:03.541 --> 34:05.418
Gunshot to the back
of the head:
who wants it?

34:06.085 --> 34:07.253
[woman] Gunshot to
the back of the head.

34:07.336 --> 34:08.463
[laughter]

34:08.545 --> 34:11.882
Going once, going twice,
Three times, Sold!

34:11.966 --> 34:13.301
[woman]  Yes,
I want to get killed.

34:14.844 --> 34:16.637
So this was, um...

34:16.763 --> 34:18.056
in the trailer,
this would have been

34:18.139 --> 34:20.183
preparing for one of
the execution scenes

34:20.266 --> 34:23.518
where one of
the militia people basically

34:24.270 --> 34:26.731
executes four people in a row.

34:27.065 --> 34:28.983
So we were
prepping for that spot.

34:29.609 --> 34:31.902
[interviewer]
Didn't it strike you
as kind of creepy?

34:31.985 --> 34:33.780
Yeah. Very creepy.

34:36.364 --> 34:38.659
It's like this. Yeah.

34:38.743 --> 34:41.329
You could even give
a little bit of a cock
on this if you want.

34:41.411 --> 34:43.956
Just bang, bang, bang,
and even like--

34:44.040 --> 34:45.666
Don't even walk up
to the fourth guy,

34:45.750 --> 34:47.335
just kind of do it
from a distance. Bang.

34:47.710 --> 34:49.212
Okay, just listen
for the pop, guys,

34:49.295 --> 34:50.463
and it's gotta be instant.

34:51.380 --> 34:54.092
And guys, this is
the grossest thing
about this movie,

34:54.175 --> 34:55.009
is that it...

34:55.635 --> 34:57.512
It comes home
like this, all right?

34:58.513 --> 35:00.014
Here we go.
Here we go.

35:00.098 --> 35:01.307
Adam, first mark.

35:01.724 --> 35:03.434
Cameras rolling...

35:04.352 --> 35:05.394
Action.

35:06.646 --> 35:08.439
Here it comes, guys.
Breathing... breathing.

35:08.523 --> 35:09.482
Here it comes.

35:10.149 --> 35:11.734
[gun popping]

35:14.320 --> 35:16.739
Good. Cut.

35:16.823 --> 35:18.199
[clapping]

35:18.324 --> 35:19.283
That's gross.

35:19.367 --> 35:20.660
That's just gross, you guys.

35:21.285 --> 35:24.580
[Adam Shambour]  We'd
spent days and hours
with each other.

35:25.039 --> 35:27.542
That's kind of how
we became the little
band of brothers,

35:27.625 --> 35:29.085
or the "Crowlean Knights"

35:29.794 --> 35:30.878
as I would call it.

35:30.962 --> 35:32.255
Adam, do you know
what's going on?

35:32.338 --> 35:34.340
Absolutely not.
I just listen to you.

35:35.341 --> 35:37.135
We only hire
the finest people here.

35:37.218 --> 35:38.261
[David] Hey, Adam, you ready?

35:38.344 --> 35:42.223
I never felt like David was
necessarily the alpha dog.

35:42.306 --> 35:44.767
It was more of David was
the type of person

35:44.851 --> 35:47.270
that would literally
give his shirt for you,

35:47.353 --> 35:48.729
right off his back for you.

35:48.980 --> 35:50.356
Anyone who's not
packing should be.

35:51.357 --> 35:54.569
[Adam]  He turned
into a pit bull
when he was directing

35:54.652 --> 35:56.112
but set that aside.

35:56.195 --> 35:58.322
I mean, he was a sweetheart.

35:58.447 --> 36:00.116
[David] Awesome.

36:00.199 --> 36:01.492
[Adam] What's next?
What do we do next?

36:01.576 --> 36:03.744
Oh, yeah.
You're my AD, okay?

36:03.828 --> 36:04.787
Okay.

36:04.871 --> 36:07.123
So if it's gonna be
down to a situation

36:07.206 --> 36:08.499
where we get the cameras
over here and...

36:08.583 --> 36:11.210
[Adam]  I think Komel's role
with  Gray State  is,

36:11.294 --> 36:13.921
she was literally
David's cheerleader.

36:14.005 --> 36:17.300
Like just always there
at his beck and call,

36:17.675 --> 36:21.012
night and day, to get
this project pushed and done,

36:21.137 --> 36:23.264
you know,
because David's success

36:23.472 --> 36:25.516
would ultimately
mean their success.

36:25.892 --> 36:28.144
[David] We have to like him,
otherwise we do not care.

36:28.227 --> 36:29.520
And when he comes in
at the end, like,

36:29.604 --> 36:30.813
"Oh, that guy again."

36:30.897 --> 36:32.273
[Komel] I don't think
you're supposed to care.

36:32.398 --> 36:33.316
It's not about him.

36:33.399 --> 36:34.233
Tried to save Kelly,

36:34.317 --> 36:36.611
and then he throws
this beautiful funeral
for this girl,

36:36.694 --> 36:37.862
which I like.

36:38.696 --> 36:40.740
And, you know,
there's just something
mysterious about him

36:40.823 --> 36:41.949
and I'd like to
leave it there.

36:42.033 --> 36:43.201
I don't want to
know him yet

36:43.284 --> 36:44.744
'cause I'm trying to
figure Daniel out.

36:45.912 --> 36:47.538
[Cory Zurowski]  Komel
still is a mystery.

36:47.997 --> 36:51.792
I mean, the vibe
that I always got

36:51.918 --> 36:54.295
was free thinking,
independent woman.

36:54.378 --> 36:56.505
[gunshots]

36:56.881 --> 37:01.510
So the idea that she
somehow becomes a puppet
of her husband just...

37:02.094 --> 37:04.222
that's the question
that's still there, right?

37:09.393 --> 37:11.103
[Sarah]  Komel was
definitely intelligent.

37:11.187 --> 37:14.649
She was definitely
very good at anything

37:14.732 --> 37:16.692
that she put her mind to.

37:17.443 --> 37:19.612
But I think what
made her so good was that

37:19.695 --> 37:22.406
she was intelligent but
also extremely passionate.

37:23.616 --> 37:25.159
[David]
Come on, baby. Get it.

37:25.243 --> 37:26.327
I'm gonna run with you.

37:29.038 --> 37:32.541
She was easy to talk to,
and was a quick thinker

37:32.750 --> 37:34.168
when you would
ask her questions.

37:35.378 --> 37:38.005
She was intellectually
curious and jumped on

37:38.089 --> 37:41.884
whatever she thought
she should be pursuing.

37:42.510 --> 37:44.512
If it was the Paleo diet,

37:44.762 --> 37:46.264
she was all
on board with that.

37:46.597 --> 37:48.140
They named their dog "Paleo."

37:48.599 --> 37:51.811
You know, I think
she was trying to
find her place.

37:55.398 --> 37:56.732
[David] What are
you guys doing?

37:56.816 --> 37:58.276
We're making cupcakes.

37:59.068 --> 38:00.695
[David] Looks like eggs.

38:00.778 --> 38:02.571
Yup, egg and bananas.

38:03.072 --> 38:04.198
[David] Bananas?

38:04.282 --> 38:05.408
And butter!

38:05.491 --> 38:06.784
And butter, too.

38:07.535 --> 38:11.706
So Komel starts
baking cakes and
she realizes how...

38:12.748 --> 38:13.874
good she is at it.

38:13.958 --> 38:15.334
Not only good
but amazing.

38:17.336 --> 38:20.965
So she starts
her idea, KC Cakes.

38:25.136 --> 38:29.223
She would make like
an Elmo cake for Raniya
for her birthday.

38:35.354 --> 38:37.356
This could
have been huge
if she wanted to,

38:37.440 --> 38:38.733
she was that good.

38:46.157 --> 38:47.199
This one...

38:47.283 --> 38:48.826
this was my
birthday cake here.

38:49.618 --> 38:51.495
Notice the golfer
taking the divot

38:51.912 --> 38:54.540
and not even hitting the ball,

38:54.915 --> 38:58.627
so... like,
she's very perceptive.

39:03.841 --> 39:06.802
Emotionally, she was
very smart, um,

39:06.886 --> 39:10.014
and I think David
really trusted her

39:11.307 --> 39:13.684
with his feelings
and emotions.

39:17.396 --> 39:20.066
I just wish I could
watch it rather than read.

39:20.149 --> 39:22.068
That's what I
hated about it.

39:23.319 --> 39:26.030
And I hope you
make it better than
what I'm imagining.

39:27.114 --> 39:28.074
You will.

39:28.199 --> 39:30.659
[Cory Zurowski]
So David Crowley
bucks all convention.

39:30.785 --> 39:34.789
He self-funds
a trailer for a movie
that doesn't exist.

39:35.247 --> 39:38.292
He's gonna use that trailer
as a marketing tool

39:38.376 --> 39:40.169
to get money to pay himself

39:40.252 --> 39:41.837
in order so he can
write the script.

39:42.046 --> 39:43.756
Then he's gonna
take that script,

39:43.839 --> 39:46.384
take it to Hollywood,
get 30 million bucks

39:46.467 --> 39:48.344
to make the movie
that he wants to make.

39:49.053 --> 39:50.471
It's an improbable dream.

39:50.554 --> 39:52.681
I mean, it's a guy
in Apple Valley.

39:52.765 --> 39:55.935
He's unemployed,
he's got a young family,

39:56.018 --> 39:58.145
and he's doing it
in reverse order.

39:58.229 --> 40:00.898
I don't believe that
even he could have foresaw

40:00.981 --> 40:02.900
how successful
that was gonna be.

40:08.406 --> 40:10.491
[instrumental music playing]

40:16.997 --> 40:20.251
Fuck, yeah!
Fuck, yeah!

40:26.674 --> 40:28.384
Fuck, yeah!

40:39.728 --> 40:41.981
All right!
Let's go!

40:49.864 --> 40:51.449
No time for that!

40:59.081 --> 41:01.250
Won't do it sir,
it's too risky!

41:07.715 --> 41:08.549
[turns music off]

41:11.552 --> 41:13.554
Oh, fuck yeah.

41:16.891 --> 41:17.892
Hello?

41:19.351 --> 41:20.936
Oh, hi, baby,
how's it going?

41:22.897 --> 41:24.899
[Rani]  Watch this, Daddy.

41:24.982 --> 41:27.067
[David] Okay, uh,
parents, parents...

41:27.151 --> 41:28.527
Once we get
everyone together...

41:28.736 --> 41:30.905
[kids laughing]

41:33.324 --> 41:36.994
[David]  You know how
the police typically
view us "peasants"

41:37.536 --> 41:39.955
in situations where
they get to use
their weapons.

41:40.206 --> 41:42.625
They have no regard
for your rights, okay?

41:42.708 --> 41:43.751
So what's
going to happen,

41:43.834 --> 41:46.295
this is a 3:00 a.m. raid,
okay, you're all asleep,

41:46.587 --> 41:47.796
so you're all
in your pajamas.

41:47.880 --> 41:50.966
If you feel like
you're warm enough,
I want you barefoot.

41:51.050 --> 41:52.885
You're getting pulled
out of your bed in
the middle of the night

41:52.968 --> 41:54.053
by these armed goons.

41:54.345 --> 41:55.471
They're gonna
take you up,

41:55.554 --> 41:56.889
gonna force you
to the ground...

41:56.972 --> 41:58.724
He's basically telling
all these little kids

41:58.807 --> 42:02.311
that we're essentially
going to, uh, you know,

42:02.394 --> 42:04.396
rip you out of
this house, and...

42:04.480 --> 42:05.731
[David]  Okay,
so listen up.

42:05.814 --> 42:07.233
I'm gonna instruct
my squad leaders

42:07.316 --> 42:09.401
if it gets too scary,
too intense,

42:09.527 --> 42:11.612
the safety word
is "banana", okay?

42:11.695 --> 42:12.696
[laughter]

42:12.780 --> 42:15.407
So you can scream
"Don't hurt me",
"Stop hurting me", and stuff,

42:15.491 --> 42:16.450
and they're not
going to listen.

42:16.534 --> 42:19.078
Say "banana,"
they'll stop.

42:20.329 --> 42:21.372
Funny...

42:22.998 --> 42:25.084
He could even get kids
to do what he wanted.

42:27.127 --> 42:28.337
[David] And action.

42:47.106 --> 42:47.982
Cut.

42:48.065 --> 42:50.025
That was it.
Great job.

42:50.109 --> 42:53.529
[applause]

42:54.905 --> 42:56.365
[Komel] Hey, what
does "dangerous" mean?

42:56.907 --> 42:59.368
Danger means
scary monster,

42:59.451 --> 43:01.328
that's what
dangerous means.

43:01.412 --> 43:02.246
[Komal] Okay.

43:03.122 --> 43:04.498
When you
push the red one

43:04.582 --> 43:07.376
then the monsters
are gonna get you
and they're bloody.

43:07.668 --> 43:08.919
[Komel laughing]

43:10.254 --> 43:13.090
No, no, when you're
a little girl and then,

43:13.173 --> 43:16.677
and then you get
a owie right here.

43:16.760 --> 43:18.470
[David]
Bloody monster's coming.

43:18.762 --> 43:22.182
It's gonna get
Mommy Komel.

43:22.391 --> 43:25.477
And then, and then
when she's a little girl,

43:25.561 --> 43:27.605
and then she got
blood on her face,

43:27.688 --> 43:30.566
and then monster's
gonna get her

43:30.649 --> 43:32.484
when she's a little girl.

43:32.610 --> 43:35.613
[whispering] And then
she got blood in her ears

43:35.696 --> 43:38.073
and now on her earrings.

43:38.866 --> 43:39.867
And then she...

43:39.950 --> 43:42.036
[Komel] Look at all
her dramatic effects.

43:42.161 --> 43:45.998
And then... and then
you got bloody.

43:46.290 --> 43:47.958
[Komel] She really thinks
about these things.

43:48.083 --> 43:50.336
And then she got
blood everywhere.

43:50.461 --> 43:55.132
And then this room...
and this room is bloody.

43:56.050 --> 44:00.304
And then this room was
a floor and lots of bloody

44:00.387 --> 44:03.098
and then the red man's
gonna get you

44:03.182 --> 44:04.767
and where are you...

44:04.850 --> 44:06.477
and he's gonna get

44:07.019 --> 44:09.980
[whispering] everyone when
you're a little girl.

44:12.900 --> 44:14.985
Yeah, I mean, okay.
Let's face it.

44:15.152 --> 44:18.864
You can... I mean, you know
there's a "redrum, redrum"
quality to it

44:18.947 --> 44:20.449
that's like  The Shining,  right?

44:20.658 --> 44:23.702
A premonition, that
the girl is prescient.

44:23.786 --> 44:25.329
I mean, the way
she's talking about
this stuff is scary,

44:27.915 --> 44:32.086
but she has been
exposed enough to some
very dark things

44:32.419 --> 44:33.921
that this is what she knows

44:34.004 --> 44:36.215
and this is what
a little girl is
now talking about.

44:36.674 --> 44:39.093
I mean, Jesus Christ.
She's five years old.

44:40.052 --> 44:44.723
[ominous music]

44:57.069 --> 45:00.155
[man chuckles] Oh!
That was great.

45:00.239 --> 45:01.782
[David chuckles] Very nice.

45:06.829 --> 45:07.788
Who wants to watch?

45:08.372 --> 45:09.498
[man] We all do.

45:17.423 --> 45:19.091
[David]  You know,
we're morally adrift.

45:19.216 --> 45:20.551
We have no
common goals.

45:21.051 --> 45:23.679
We're just a bunch
of individuals in
a collective state

45:23.762 --> 45:24.888
and we don't
support each other.

45:25.013 --> 45:26.348
And so once I
identified that

45:26.473 --> 45:27.975
I'm like,
"That's my villain."

45:28.058 --> 45:31.437
And so a person
watching this film
could be like...

45:32.187 --> 45:33.897
they subconsciously
recognize that

45:33.981 --> 45:36.275
this scene is where there's
supposed to be a meeting

45:36.358 --> 45:38.610
between the hero
and the villain.

45:44.616 --> 45:47.453
[ominous music]

46:01.508 --> 46:04.344
[applause]

46:04.428 --> 46:05.762
[David] Thank you very much.

46:07.097 --> 46:09.433
This is a marketing
promotional tool.

46:10.559 --> 46:12.686
Now that the gates
have been lifted,

46:12.769 --> 46:15.397
the veil has been
breached, as it were...

46:15.522 --> 46:17.232
um, we are ready to go.

46:17.316 --> 46:20.360
[applause and cheering]

46:25.199 --> 46:27.284
[Danny]  I think, for us,
shooting the concept trailer,

46:27.367 --> 46:28.535
raising the money that we did,

46:28.619 --> 46:31.246
setting the goal
and crushing the goal
that we set for,

46:31.580 --> 46:33.957
um, back then we thought
it was totally feasible

46:34.041 --> 46:35.501
to do what we
were going to do.

46:35.584 --> 46:37.544
We're very, very fortunate

46:37.836 --> 46:41.298
to have the crew
from  Gray State  here today.

46:41.381 --> 46:43.634
[cheering]

46:43.884 --> 46:46.178
[Jason Allen]  I think
the fans had a great
expectation of David.

46:46.261 --> 46:48.555
I think they saw
the  Gray State  as

46:48.972 --> 46:51.975
the potential voice
for this message

46:52.059 --> 46:53.685
and this story to be told.

46:54.353 --> 46:55.812
This is
David Crowley,

46:55.896 --> 46:57.564
the brains
behind the madness.

46:57.856 --> 46:59.858
These guys are
working very hard

46:59.942 --> 47:01.527
to put out this
incredible film.

47:01.610 --> 47:02.736
Big time stuff.

47:02.986 --> 47:07.282
So to hold David to that
standard of excellence

47:07.366 --> 47:09.076
that he set himself up for,

47:09.159 --> 47:11.537
this amazing concept
trailer that he put together

47:11.620 --> 47:12.913
and this movement of videos

47:12.996 --> 47:16.208
and social media
and press attention...

47:17.000 --> 47:20.254
they expected
an incredible movie.

47:22.923 --> 47:24.967
[David]  Obviously,
the things that we're showing,

47:25.050 --> 47:27.135
the things that we're saying
are appealing to people,

47:27.219 --> 47:29.179
and it's making it
a very popular idea.

47:29.555 --> 47:31.932
So this project
started as sort of, like,

47:32.266 --> 47:34.017
"What am I
gonna do this spring?"

47:34.434 --> 47:36.520
But it's developed
into this beast

47:36.603 --> 47:38.021
that we can't even
keep up with.

47:39.523 --> 47:42.025
[Cory Zurowski]
So in the fall of 2012,
the trailer comes out

47:42.109 --> 47:44.903
and it very quickly
just explodes online.

47:45.195 --> 47:46.905
He becomes a
YouTube sensation,

47:46.989 --> 47:49.992
it's shared everywhere
on social media,

47:50.075 --> 47:51.493
Facebook, Twitter,
whatever it may be,

47:51.577 --> 47:54.621
and conspiracy theorists
believe that this guy is
perhaps the messenger.

47:54.705 --> 47:57.332
[David] It's a near-future
collapse of society
under Marshall Law.

47:57.416 --> 47:59.626
[Cory]  They've ordained
him in some special way

47:59.710 --> 48:01.837
and they're
wanting him to deliver.

48:03.547 --> 48:07.843
[Alex Jones]
Google, Yahoo, they all
admit for three years

48:07.926 --> 48:10.095
they are censoring
for Communist China.

48:10.178 --> 48:11.305
You understand?

48:11.597 --> 48:13.849
Now they're doing it
on a mass scale

48:13.932 --> 48:15.934
in the US, England,
Canada, and Europe.

48:16.018 --> 48:18.854
Are we gonna put up
with Communist Chinese style,

48:18.937 --> 48:21.982
or worse,
censorship of the sites?

48:22.065 --> 48:23.066
It's happening!

48:23.150 --> 48:24.568
No! Not gonna do it!

48:24.651 --> 48:27.529
ComCast, Time-Warner,
others are doing it
right here in Texas.

48:27.613 --> 48:29.281
ComCast is doing it
in New York.

48:29.823 --> 48:31.658
Other major, uh,
the two major...

48:31.742 --> 48:32.868
That's what
I've been saying!

48:39.958 --> 48:41.418
Hey, Alex, good to
talk to you again.

48:41.501 --> 48:44.171
I'm David Crowley, I'm
the writer and director
of  Gray State.

48:44.254 --> 48:46.465
Ah, what will happen
in the film is,

48:46.548 --> 48:47.841
the reason we call it
"gray state,"

48:47.924 --> 48:48.800
or one of
the reasons is that

48:48.884 --> 48:50.302
it's a division of reality.

48:50.385 --> 48:52.971
So we have people
who are living in
the Alex Jones world,

48:53.055 --> 48:54.014
who know what's going on,

48:54.097 --> 48:55.599
and the people
who simply don't.

48:55.849 --> 49:00.187
My role in this whole thing
was not just be there

49:00.270 --> 49:01.563
and assist David
with whatever he wanted,

49:01.647 --> 49:03.357
because he knew
he already had
my commitment,

49:03.440 --> 49:05.817
but I was, of course,
David's personal Rolodex.

49:05.942 --> 49:08.153
I'd been doing
the work in the trenches

49:08.236 --> 49:10.447
with the revolution for years,

49:10.530 --> 49:11.740
and I so I knew
everybody already.

49:11.865 --> 49:13.116
What camera do you
want me to look at?

49:13.283 --> 49:14.743
[David] Look at--
You're talking to Sean.

49:14.826 --> 49:15.661
Talk to Sean.

49:15.744 --> 49:18.372
Okay. I got it, guys.

49:22.167 --> 49:25.003
We see a giant arms race

49:25.087 --> 49:26.421
against the American people.

49:26.505 --> 49:28.465
But not just here
in the United States,
worldwide.

49:28.548 --> 49:29.925
We see the globalists building

49:30.008 --> 49:32.302
a giant police
state control grid,

49:32.386 --> 49:35.097
and calling
themselves technocrats.

49:35.180 --> 49:38.392
A technocrat is
a group of dictators

49:38.475 --> 49:41.269
who use technology
to control people.

49:41.478 --> 49:43.647
We are already
beginning to fall

49:43.730 --> 49:44.981
to the gray state.

49:45.065 --> 49:49.194
We will not bow!
We will not bow!

49:49.361 --> 49:52.489
[Alex Jones]
This fight is for
the future of humanity

49:52.614 --> 49:53.865
and we are in the fight,

49:53.949 --> 49:55.450
and it's now
time for humanity

49:55.534 --> 49:58.161
to restore the republic
and restore freedom

49:58.245 --> 49:59.830
and the Bill of Rights
and Constitution.

49:59.913 --> 50:01.498
It's just that simple.

50:02.374 --> 50:03.458
[David] I don't
want to take up
too much of your time

50:03.542 --> 50:05.836
but can we have
verbal consent to
use this footage?

50:06.044 --> 50:07.546
Yeah, you can
use this, go ahead.

50:07.629 --> 50:08.547
[David] Your name?

50:08.630 --> 50:09.840
I'm Alex Jones.

50:13.552 --> 50:15.470
[Sean Wright]  There was
already this movement

50:15.554 --> 50:17.180
that was right at its peak

50:17.264 --> 50:19.307
when David was
coming along with
the  Gray State  project.

50:20.767 --> 50:21.727
So it wasn't corralling.

50:21.810 --> 50:22.936
There was already
a big audience.

50:23.895 --> 50:25.480
And then the rest of
the audience

50:25.564 --> 50:27.899
came once they saw
what was being put out.

50:28.900 --> 50:30.485
Has anyone heard
of  Gray State?

50:30.736 --> 50:31.903
[crowd] Yeah!

50:32.571 --> 50:34.531
The film explores
trends like RFID,

50:34.614 --> 50:36.324
VIO, and nano technology.

50:36.533 --> 50:40.120
These represent the fusion
of authoritarian control
and human flesh.

50:40.412 --> 50:42.664
And these trends are
no longer science fiction.

50:42.998 --> 50:45.208
[Cory Zurowski]
David Crowley
is the warrior,

50:45.292 --> 50:48.253
right, he's the warrior,
though, that is the artist.

50:48.503 --> 50:52.507
And, in that, they see
a guy who can be
a leader of this movement.

50:52.591 --> 50:56.219
He's the guy that's
going to take it
beyond just chat rooms

50:56.303 --> 50:57.679
to a bigger discussion.

50:57.763 --> 50:59.931
And while I make
no claim that
my efforts as an artist

51:00.015 --> 51:03.185
best exemplify the thoughts
and feelings of every
person in this room,

51:03.393 --> 51:06.062
I do assert that,
as far as expressions
of freedom go,

51:06.354 --> 51:08.231
this is one
we can all get behind.

51:08.607 --> 51:09.816
And through
our united effort,

51:09.900 --> 51:12.611
we can keep this film
in the fiction section.

51:12.778 --> 51:13.904
Thank you.

51:14.070 --> 51:16.490
[applause]

51:16.656 --> 51:19.367
Once you get into
this information, there
really is no end to it.

51:19.451 --> 51:22.621
It just leads into
the next conspiracy,
the next conspiracy.

51:23.163 --> 51:24.706
For example,
you wanna ask why

51:24.790 --> 51:25.957
veterans are on
the watch list.

51:26.041 --> 51:27.083
Now this is coming out.

51:27.167 --> 51:30.086
Police agencies
are being trained
to watch veterans.

51:30.962 --> 51:34.466
So, uh, veterans,
gun owners, patriots,

51:34.549 --> 51:37.052
these sort of people
who are independent
of the system,

51:37.135 --> 51:38.011
or can be...

51:38.762 --> 51:41.056
are they really a threat
to the new world order?

51:41.723 --> 51:42.808
You're fucking right they are.

51:42.891 --> 51:44.559
That's why
they're being targeted.

51:45.185 --> 51:47.896
I guess I'm rambling,
I got nothing.
What's the next thing?

51:52.818 --> 51:55.153
[Joe Seaton]  I think
he had an element
of paranoia to him.

51:55.487 --> 51:56.988
Like, whatever
you told him

51:57.072 --> 51:58.990
it's just,
he wasn't trusting it.

52:02.285 --> 52:05.997
He had gone through
this transformation
on that deployment.

52:08.333 --> 52:10.544
You know,
it shocks the system,

52:10.752 --> 52:12.838
and you start looking
at the world differently.

52:19.052 --> 52:21.179
Hey, guys, it's David Crowley
from the  Gray State  project.

52:21.263 --> 52:22.973
Tonight I'm going to be
shooting a little bit

52:23.056 --> 52:24.975
for the documentary
Gray State: The Rise.

52:25.225 --> 52:27.060
It's something that
I've been picturing

52:27.143 --> 52:29.229
for the awakening moment,
that is,

52:29.938 --> 52:34.568
the eyes opening to
appreciate the truth

52:34.651 --> 52:36.528
about our surroundings
and our reality.

52:37.404 --> 52:38.655
[Rani murmuring]

52:38.738 --> 52:40.657
Shh... Shh...

52:42.033 --> 52:45.495
So I'm using
my wife Komel
as the main subject.

52:45.912 --> 52:48.665
She ends up being in
most of my projects.

52:49.833 --> 52:51.251
Should I look at her
at all, like--

52:51.334 --> 52:52.627
-No.
-Oh, I'm so concerned.

52:52.711 --> 52:53.670
Fear for your life.

52:56.423 --> 52:58.466
[Joe Seaton]  He always
had to be in control

52:58.550 --> 53:00.677
of everything,
every variable.

53:00.760 --> 53:02.178
Uh, and there was no...

53:02.304 --> 53:03.889
there was no
collaborating with him.

53:03.972 --> 53:05.265
That was the problem, so...

53:06.474 --> 53:08.018
I think I should
lean into her.

53:08.351 --> 53:10.395
Moms do that,
like, holding
their child closer.

53:10.478 --> 53:12.606
[David] No. It looks
a little bit
clichéd and stupid.

53:14.107 --> 53:15.358
Do you want
to hit "play"?

53:15.734 --> 53:17.527
[Rani crying]

53:22.365 --> 53:23.617
[Dan Crowley, Sr.]
I never saw them argue.

53:23.700 --> 53:25.076
I never saw
anything like that.

53:25.160 --> 53:30.874
Um, they did have
a bad spell back, uh, in 2013.

53:31.625 --> 53:33.043
I think David was
on the road so much

53:33.126 --> 53:34.711
in doing this
Gray State  stuff

53:35.003 --> 53:36.421
and I think Komel felt

53:36.504 --> 53:38.840
she was holding the family
together financially,

53:38.924 --> 53:42.093
and filling in while David
was gone so much that,

53:42.177 --> 53:45.472
um, they had
a rough spot for a while.

53:46.723 --> 53:48.183
Did you guys have
a surprise at school?

53:48.266 --> 53:49.684
'Cause that's
what the paper said.

53:50.185 --> 53:51.311
Meow, meow.

53:51.853 --> 53:53.313
[Sarah Johnson]
Komel and I both
worked in a clinic

53:53.396 --> 53:56.358
where we saw clients
with eating disorders.

53:56.691 --> 53:58.318
The business that
we created together

53:58.401 --> 54:02.614
was for nutrition
around people with
autoimmune diseases.

54:04.574 --> 54:06.534
I would say
Komel and David
were definitely

54:06.618 --> 54:08.787
both at a point
in their life that I think

54:08.870 --> 54:12.374
they both had
pretty strong passions
for separate things.

54:12.624 --> 54:15.210
Komel, with the nutrition,
David, more the film.

54:16.878 --> 54:20.507
She did not have
many other friends
outside of myself.

54:21.257 --> 54:26.221
She made a lot of comments
that she would have loved
to have more friends,

54:26.304 --> 54:28.431
and that she was looking
for ways to do so.

54:29.182 --> 54:33.436
It was just kind of,
"Oh, David is a little
different, so, you know,

54:33.520 --> 54:34.396
it just doesn't work out."

54:34.479 --> 54:36.856
But I could tell she was
always very disappointed.

54:37.691 --> 54:40.110
[Susan Houghton]
Komel's behavior
didn't add up.

54:40.652 --> 54:42.487
He was involved
in everything

54:42.612 --> 54:45.448
and she always
made it seem like

54:45.532 --> 54:47.200
it's exactly
what she wanted.

54:48.743 --> 54:50.286
All right, Rani.
Say "Hi, Mommy."

54:50.370 --> 54:51.246
Hi, Mommy.

54:51.329 --> 54:52.872
Okay, now we're gonna
do this spin, okay?

54:53.164 --> 54:58.044
Okay, let's spin.
Ready, set, go!

54:58.128 --> 54:59.879
Ahh! So spinny!

55:01.172 --> 55:03.591
[Rani babbling]

55:05.010 --> 55:06.928
I think you don't like it
as much as last time, huh?

55:07.012 --> 55:08.138
It's fun, Daddy.

55:08.221 --> 55:10.473
You like it? Is it fun?

55:10.849 --> 55:12.976
-Yeah?
-Whoa!

55:13.059 --> 55:16.563
[screaming and laughing]

55:20.191 --> 55:22.193
[Cory Zurowski]
So less than two years
after the trailer comes out,

55:22.277 --> 55:23.820
he's made his way
to Hollywood,

55:24.029 --> 55:25.655
he has script in hand,

55:26.031 --> 55:29.534
he makes contacts
with legitimate
Hollywood insiders

55:29.617 --> 55:31.494
who believe and tell David

55:31.578 --> 55:35.081
that they're going to
go out there and
raise the money

55:35.540 --> 55:37.375
for a 30-million
dollar movie.

55:51.264 --> 55:55.060
The way I would
pitch this thing is
America's finally had enough.

55:55.393 --> 55:57.812
It's the population of
this country has had enough

55:57.937 --> 55:59.856
of the corrupt government,
and they make a stand.

56:00.648 --> 56:03.109
I think to this day,
there's still
a built-in audience

56:03.193 --> 56:04.652
for a film like this.

56:07.072 --> 56:09.074
David did a phenomenal job

56:09.574 --> 56:11.201
grass-rooting this project.

56:11.284 --> 56:13.286
You know, we see
all that from our aspect

56:13.369 --> 56:15.080
and everything that
David put into this

56:15.163 --> 56:16.873
was phenomenal
in our eyes

56:16.956 --> 56:19.375
just because of
how this thing grew.

56:19.459 --> 56:20.794
It took on its own legs

56:20.877 --> 56:22.796
and grew and grew
and grew and grew.

56:31.679 --> 56:33.890
[Mike Boggio] So this is
our June 29th meeting.

56:33.973 --> 56:36.643
We're sitting at a pub
on Sunset Blvd
in Hollywood.

56:36.726 --> 56:38.478
We all did
a celebratory shot

56:38.645 --> 56:40.480
to conduct new business.

56:40.814 --> 56:43.733
David was very laid back,
very, very calm,

56:44.109 --> 56:45.819
uh, in that meeting.

56:45.902 --> 56:48.071
It was just very,
very, very professional.

56:48.530 --> 56:50.323
[interviewer] No sense
of just, you know,

56:50.406 --> 56:52.242
he was hitting
his lines, or...

56:52.325 --> 56:53.910
No, I never got that
impression at all.

56:53.993 --> 56:56.246
If he was acting, he was
one of the best actors
I've ever seen.

56:56.329 --> 56:57.914
Yeah, I was just going
to say the same thing.

56:58.873 --> 56:59.791
[tapping]

57:00.834 --> 57:01.835
[David]  Shitty pen.

57:01.918 --> 57:04.295
Shitty, shitty pen, pen,
we hate you.

57:04.963 --> 57:09.300
Uh... Mike's meeting two:
the outline.

57:10.510 --> 57:12.220
Projecting power, confidence.

57:12.345 --> 57:15.306
Talk fast. Talk fast,
easy and project.

57:15.890 --> 57:16.766
[sighs]

57:16.850 --> 57:18.226
Komel's right.
Komel's right.

57:18.309 --> 57:19.644
You're wearing
something black.

57:19.727 --> 57:21.354
You gotta show
some arm veins.

57:21.438 --> 57:23.022
A watch on
the left wrist,

57:23.106 --> 57:24.274
bracelets on the right.

57:24.357 --> 57:26.484
Uh, a necklace
that's long enough
to be tucked in.

57:26.568 --> 57:27.485
Nothing too flashy,

57:27.569 --> 57:30.196
just enough to indicate
that you're confident
with your personality.

57:31.906 --> 57:34.033
I'm not a fleece, you know.

57:34.284 --> 57:36.369
I'm not just a quick fleece.

57:38.288 --> 57:40.748
You're talking to me
because this is my project.

57:40.832 --> 57:42.959
[sighs]  That transition's
weak. Um...

57:43.334 --> 57:45.628
I had 4,000-- First of all,
I had 4,000 fans

57:45.712 --> 57:47.922
before there was
even a concept trailer,

57:48.006 --> 57:49.674
and I dropped it
to those people,

57:49.757 --> 57:52.343
and it ballooned to 32,000
that you see today.

57:52.427 --> 57:54.387
These are the proverbial
fish in a barrel

57:54.554 --> 57:56.431
that every time you say
"new world order,"

57:56.514 --> 57:57.932
they get out their wallets.

57:58.558 --> 58:02.770
[clears throat]
So, uh, how are
the rewrites?

58:02.854 --> 58:04.564
This will
probably start it.

58:04.856 --> 58:06.232
How are the rewrites?

58:06.399 --> 58:07.609
First thing
you're going to do

58:07.692 --> 58:10.069
is see what they do
to each other.

58:10.278 --> 58:11.571
Do they look at each other?

58:11.654 --> 58:13.406
Are they measuring me
right now?

58:16.034 --> 58:17.327
Mike, I see one producer,

58:17.410 --> 58:19.287
just one producer credit
on your IMBD.

58:19.370 --> 58:23.291
This tells me
that this is either
MEG's first production,

58:23.583 --> 58:25.543
or you guys have
something else in mind.

58:26.544 --> 58:28.338
Remember, you're
achieving a dominant position

58:28.421 --> 58:29.631
by matching their...

58:30.006 --> 58:31.508
matching their experience

58:31.591 --> 58:32.926
with your enthusiasm.

58:34.177 --> 58:36.346
So let them answer,
but you're...

58:36.429 --> 58:37.722
wrap up now.

58:37.889 --> 58:41.476
Here's the sunset
on your beautiful day

58:41.559 --> 58:43.686
with your partnership
with the Mikes.

58:49.025 --> 58:50.109
Ha!

58:50.193 --> 58:52.195
It's hard to--
It's hard to express it.

58:52.278 --> 58:56.199
I'm... I'm...
I got chills, actually.

58:56.950 --> 58:58.618
It's the most
divisive bullshit

58:58.701 --> 58:59.911
I've ever heard
in my life.

59:00.787 --> 59:03.331
That's not the David
who I met.

59:03.998 --> 59:04.916
Not at all.

59:04.999 --> 59:06.793
This is manipulative
and this is psychotic.

59:06.876 --> 59:07.794
Yeah.

59:08.169 --> 59:11.005
I'm very...
I'm very insulted by it

59:11.756 --> 59:15.176
because what he's doing,
he's taking an adversarial
position towards us

59:15.593 --> 59:17.679
and playing us for chumps
from day one.

59:18.137 --> 59:21.724
And yet from day one,
it was a collaboration

59:21.808 --> 59:23.726
and a collaborative
effort for the project.

59:23.935 --> 59:26.354
This is the complete
opposite of that.

59:26.437 --> 59:28.773
This is "I am, you know,
controlling the project.

59:28.856 --> 59:31.609
I'm going to work out
exactly what words to say

59:31.693 --> 59:33.319
to elicit what response."

59:33.695 --> 59:35.947
This is... craziness.

59:40.535 --> 59:41.995
[David]  I don't even
have to write it.

59:42.287 --> 59:43.997
I just have to
have the idea

59:44.163 --> 59:46.124
and people will
start to do things.

59:47.542 --> 59:50.545
And I will make money
off of it.  [laughs]

59:51.421 --> 59:53.381
Because this thing
exists in my head.

59:53.464 --> 59:54.966
Whatever comes
out of this--

59:55.133 --> 59:56.593
This, this first deal...

59:56.676 --> 59:58.344
I don't know what'll
happen afterwards

59:58.428 --> 59:59.637
'cause we're
creating this thing

59:59.721 --> 01:00:01.514
that exists
outside of all of us.

01:00:02.724 --> 01:00:07.061
[Komel]  You're given this
thing and told, like,

01:00:07.145 --> 01:00:09.897
"You're David, you have a--
You have a task.

01:00:09.981 --> 01:00:11.774
You're... You're a God."

01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:18.323
[David sighs]  We've
worked so hard
and stuck together in--

01:00:18.406 --> 01:00:19.449
[Komel]  Everything.

01:00:19.532 --> 01:00:21.200
We've stuck together
through everything.

01:00:21.284 --> 01:00:23.244
[David]  I'm so happy
I understand you better.

01:00:24.579 --> 01:00:26.539
I love... I love
the bitch in you.

01:00:26.623 --> 01:00:28.082
[Komel laughing]

01:00:29.876 --> 01:00:32.587
Passion, intensity...
you know,

01:00:32.670 --> 01:00:35.965
love is a lot of things.
and love can be...

01:00:36.424 --> 01:00:37.842
it can turn
into hatred too.

01:00:37.925 --> 01:00:39.510
It can turn into
something negative

01:00:39.761 --> 01:00:41.429
if you put too much
passion into it.

01:00:48.853 --> 01:00:51.105
[Adam]  I just was
concerned for him

01:00:52.398 --> 01:00:56.861
because he'd go from
hanging out with
a person religiously

01:00:56.944 --> 01:00:58.613
to getting cut off.

01:00:59.614 --> 01:01:00.698
[gunshots]

01:01:01.908 --> 01:01:05.119
I mean, he withdrew from
all of us so hard, like,

01:01:05.203 --> 01:01:07.580
I'd text him and it would
take a couple of days

01:01:07.664 --> 01:01:08.665
for him to get back to us,

01:01:08.748 --> 01:01:10.333
and it's like,
"What's going on, man?"

01:01:10.416 --> 01:01:13.086
He's like "I'm writing.
I promise I'll-- You know,
dah, dah, dah, dah."

01:01:13.169 --> 01:01:15.505
And then when he
emerged from that,

01:01:15.755 --> 01:01:18.383
that's when he said to
all of us, like, you know,

01:01:18.466 --> 01:01:20.718
"If you ever see me
doing that again,

01:01:20.927 --> 01:01:23.262
say something. Tell me.

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:25.598
'Cause I went to
a dark place.

01:01:26.224 --> 01:01:28.184
So if I ever go back
to my dark place,

01:01:28.267 --> 01:01:29.519
please tell me."

01:01:34.023 --> 01:01:37.318
Komel came to me one day
and out of the blue, said,

01:01:37.402 --> 01:01:40.405
"I want to
separate the business."

01:01:40.863 --> 01:01:42.448
At first, it was a shock.

01:01:43.241 --> 01:01:45.451
I would receive these
long emails from her,

01:01:45.535 --> 01:01:48.371
um, which never
matched up

01:01:48.454 --> 01:01:50.581
with the way that
she would speak
to me in person.

01:01:53.251 --> 01:01:54.836
I remember
saying to her
at one point,

01:01:54.919 --> 01:01:57.922
"Komel, I feel like
I'm speaking
to David, not you."

01:02:05.304 --> 01:02:07.473
[Dan Crowley, Sr.]
Um... this is a journal entry.

01:02:07.890 --> 01:02:10.309
"It's been a busy week
writing  Gray State,

01:02:10.393 --> 01:02:11.436
polishing it up.

01:02:11.936 --> 01:02:13.688
By the time you
read this again,

01:02:13.855 --> 01:02:15.690
this whole nightmare
will be over."

01:02:19.485 --> 01:02:21.863
David started
journaling in Day One.

01:02:21.946 --> 01:02:24.073
It's a program for
journaling, um,

01:02:24.198 --> 01:02:27.535
where he'd put
pictures in every entry.

01:02:29.287 --> 01:02:30.872
They were random
pictures, I think,

01:02:30.955 --> 01:02:32.373
but then he'd just journal

01:02:32.457 --> 01:02:35.168
what was going on
in his life
at the time mostly.

01:02:38.129 --> 01:02:39.547
He liked his dog a lot.

01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:41.466
I think his dog was
one of his best friends.

01:02:46.053 --> 01:02:49.390
May 31st of 2014
journal entry.

01:02:49.557 --> 01:02:51.058
"He will
perform a ritual.

01:02:51.142 --> 01:02:53.060
A prayer for
wisdom, love, empathy.

01:02:53.478 --> 01:02:56.481
These are the keys to
unlock your ideal future,

01:02:56.898 --> 01:02:58.858
and you don't have
an hour to waste."

01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:03.905
[Cory Zurowski]
So he's searching, right?

01:03:03.988 --> 01:03:08.075
He's a guy that
is trying to bring
a greater truth or truths

01:03:08.159 --> 01:03:10.453
or things that are
hidden from us.

01:03:11.579 --> 01:03:13.748
He brings
the spotlight to himself.

01:03:15.041 --> 01:03:16.584
David starts to
feel pressure.

01:03:16.667 --> 01:03:19.045
I mean, it's not just
about him anymore,

01:03:19.170 --> 01:03:21.339
it's not just about what
he's bringing to the table.

01:03:21.422 --> 01:03:23.883
He's got all these other
people at the buffet,

01:03:23.966 --> 01:03:27.720
and they want his product.

01:03:27.970 --> 01:03:31.265
They want what he said
he was going to do.

01:03:36.646 --> 01:03:39.732
[Chris Peck]  David got to
a point where he got
so upset with his fans,

01:03:39.816 --> 01:03:41.359
that if they wrote
something negative,

01:03:41.442 --> 01:03:43.110
he would ban them
from the page.

01:03:44.737 --> 01:03:46.405
He didn't want to hear
the negative anymore.

01:03:46.489 --> 01:03:48.157
He was like,
"I'm making a movie,

01:03:48.241 --> 01:03:50.409
it's gonna take time.
It's not easy.

01:03:50.493 --> 01:03:51.744
You can take it or leave it.

01:03:52.119 --> 01:03:53.871
I don't have to
listen to your shit."

01:03:55.081 --> 01:04:00.253
[Mitch Heil]  And I think
when you have a target
audience of that nature,

01:04:00.336 --> 01:04:03.923
they're going to respond
the way they always do.

01:04:04.006 --> 01:04:05.716
They're going to
not believe anything.

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:06.843
They're gonna dig.

01:04:08.094 --> 01:04:09.971
You know, kind of like
comic book movies:

01:04:10.054 --> 01:04:11.264
if you get something wrong,

01:04:11.347 --> 01:04:13.057
the diehard comic book fans

01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:15.810
are going to
attack you for this
or attack you for that.

01:04:16.143 --> 01:04:19.313
These people are just actually
legitimately insane, though.

01:04:19.397 --> 01:04:20.606
That's the difference.

01:04:23.025 --> 01:04:25.444
[Cory Zurowski]
I mean, the guy's more
libertarian than anything,

01:04:25.528 --> 01:04:28.531
but he realizes that
suspicions of wanting
less government

01:04:28.614 --> 01:04:30.575
or questioning your
government's motives

01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:32.994
or why there's wars or
why are we, you know,

01:04:33.244 --> 01:04:35.621
in Afghanistan or Iraq,
like that...

01:04:35.705 --> 01:04:38.958
um, it's way different than
these other people who...

01:04:40.334 --> 01:04:41.168
hate.

01:04:42.253 --> 01:04:46.090
And he wasn't
talking about hate.

01:04:50.928 --> 01:04:52.763
[Dan Crowley, Sr.]
August 5th, 2014.

01:04:52.847 --> 01:04:55.975
David and Komel are
preparing for Raniya's
birthday party.

01:04:56.183 --> 01:04:58.728
His quote was:
"Unveiling from
the distance

01:04:58.811 --> 01:05:00.271
everyone has
perceived in us.

01:05:00.605 --> 01:05:05.109
Ridding ourselves of
dysfunctional relationships:
friends, family."

01:05:08.654 --> 01:05:10.448
[kids laughing]

01:05:18.789 --> 01:05:20.291
[Komel] Can you say,
"Thank you"?

01:05:24.211 --> 01:05:25.755
[Susan Houghton]
At the birthday party,

01:05:25.838 --> 01:05:27.840
the only thing that
stood out to me

01:05:27.924 --> 01:05:30.259
was that they
weren't talking at all.

01:05:31.177 --> 01:05:33.804
She had nothing bad
to say about him,

01:05:33.888 --> 01:05:35.640
they had
the closest relationship,

01:05:35.723 --> 01:05:38.601
and I just expected
that they would flirt

01:05:38.684 --> 01:05:40.144
or kid around a little bit.

01:05:40.227 --> 01:05:43.230
But, no, she was just
really tense the whole time.

01:05:45.399 --> 01:05:48.027
[Adam Shambour]
I'd say it was during
Raniya's birthday party

01:05:48.527 --> 01:05:54.283
where I noticed
such a disconnect
between him and Komel

01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:56.744
and it was just
really weird.

01:05:56.827 --> 01:05:59.121
It wasn't like
any other time

01:05:59.205 --> 01:06:00.665
I've ever been
in that household.

01:06:00.748 --> 01:06:02.708
It was stale,
stagnant air.

01:06:03.334 --> 01:06:04.877
It just was bad.

01:06:07.964 --> 01:06:09.507
[Rani crying]

01:06:27.858 --> 01:06:31.654
[crying louder]

01:06:54.593 --> 01:06:57.596
[David]  This is where
you see the occult
influence in the story.

01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:00.016
You'll see almost nothing
until it spikes.

01:07:00.641 --> 01:07:03.019
But then a hint,
a hint starts to rise.

01:07:03.227 --> 01:07:04.603
But if the hint is rising,

01:07:04.687 --> 01:07:05.730
where does
the hint come from?

01:07:05.813 --> 01:07:08.232
And have I planted it
appropriately in the past?

01:07:08.441 --> 01:07:09.608
Am I able to see, like,

01:07:09.942 --> 01:07:11.527
when the bad guy's introduced,

01:07:11.610 --> 01:07:13.195
is there enough
of the occult hint?

01:07:14.447 --> 01:07:17.616
Has it been properly set up
in the inciting incident

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:20.202
so I can ultimately
bring it from nowhere

01:07:20.286 --> 01:07:25.124
and create this
emotionally-charged climax

01:07:25.207 --> 01:07:27.793
that's loaded with meaning
that you didn't see coming.

01:07:31.714 --> 01:07:34.717
[Joe Seaton]  I moved back
to Minneapolis in 2014

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:36.343
and linked back up with David.

01:07:36.927 --> 01:07:38.721
He was talking to me
a lot about spiritualism.

01:07:39.388 --> 01:07:42.433
At this point,
him and Komel had
converted, in a sense.

01:07:42.516 --> 01:07:44.810
They were no longer
talking about Christianity.

01:07:44.935 --> 01:07:46.896
They were talking about "Om"

01:07:47.021 --> 01:07:48.981
and the resonance
of the universe

01:07:49.065 --> 01:07:51.400
and transcendental philosophy,

01:07:51.525 --> 01:07:54.987
and connecting to
higher levels
of consciousness,

01:07:55.071 --> 01:07:58.491
and whatever that was,
David tapped into it.

01:07:58.616 --> 01:07:59.867
[David]  This is
just for us.

01:08:00.034 --> 01:08:01.452
It's August 29th.

01:08:01.702 --> 01:08:03.829
Rani came home
with a fever and, uh,

01:08:04.455 --> 01:08:05.706
you were connecting
and playing.

01:08:05.831 --> 01:08:07.500
Yeah, we were
painting nails

01:08:07.583 --> 01:08:10.669
and the door is right
here to her room.

01:08:10.795 --> 01:08:11.962
I was sitting on the floor

01:08:12.088 --> 01:08:13.672
and she was facing me.

01:08:14.006 --> 01:08:16.341
And I had my back
towards her bed.

01:08:17.009 --> 01:08:19.178
And then we're painting,
and then we both felt

01:08:19.261 --> 01:08:21.471
something come
through the door.

01:08:21.596 --> 01:08:23.599
David never really got
into a lot of details

01:08:23.682 --> 01:08:25.434
what was going on
with Komel spiritually

01:08:25.559 --> 01:08:27.144
or what would
actually take place.

01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:29.438
He would more
propose questions of,

01:08:29.522 --> 01:08:32.983
so if, um,
some kind of...

01:08:33.067 --> 01:08:35.402
uh, spiritual attack,
what would that look like?

01:08:35.611 --> 01:08:40.366
And then, "Okay, cool,"
and as I'm going back to
painting my nails,

01:08:40.866 --> 01:08:43.368
I know where
her voice is because
I've been talking to her.

01:08:43.452 --> 01:08:45.162
So a voice
higher than that.

01:08:45.246 --> 01:08:47.288
So I just feel like
the height was higher

01:08:47.372 --> 01:08:49.082
than where she was at
on the bed.

01:08:49.207 --> 01:08:51.252
[mimicks eerie voice]
"Do you... Do you
like the song?"

01:08:52.795 --> 01:08:54.587
I just froze.

01:08:54.839 --> 01:08:56.674
I'm like "Rani,
did you say something?"

01:08:57.508 --> 01:08:59.385
And she's quiet,

01:08:59.468 --> 01:09:02.179
and I looked to see
if she's awake, or
where it came from,

01:09:02.263 --> 01:09:04.557
she's like "What? No,
I didn't say anything."

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:06.392
I'm like,
"Did you hear that?"

01:09:06.475 --> 01:09:08.644
She's like "No, Mom.
I didn't hear anything."

01:09:08.810 --> 01:09:10.563
And I came out
and I told you.

01:09:21.407 --> 01:09:22.783
Want to know what
I really think?

01:09:22.867 --> 01:09:23.868
[interviewer]
Yeah, absolutely.

01:09:23.951 --> 01:09:29.790
Okay. I think people
lean on the supernatural

01:09:30.207 --> 01:09:34.587
when they can't understand
things that they're
experiencing and feeling.

01:09:38.256 --> 01:09:40.341
And it's easier to believe

01:09:40.634 --> 01:09:43.970
that they're being
chased by some kind of
metaphysical spirit

01:09:44.263 --> 01:09:46.724
than they're being chased
by their own problems.

01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:48.642
Fuckin' blue helmets!

01:09:51.812 --> 01:09:53.939
Blue helmets,
easy targets.

01:09:55.566 --> 01:09:58.527
[Cory Zurowski]  After
his daughter's birthday party,
he starts just shutting down.

01:09:58.611 --> 01:10:00.112
The only way out...

01:10:03.032 --> 01:10:04.909
The only way out is in.

01:10:04.992 --> 01:10:07.870
A guy who was
on social media
all the time, stops.

01:10:07.953 --> 01:10:10.414
stops returning phone calls
of the very important people

01:10:10.497 --> 01:10:12.625
who he needs in order for
his dream to be realized.

01:10:12.708 --> 01:10:13.834
Fuck you!

01:10:14.210 --> 01:10:16.754
And nobody
really knows why.

01:10:19.506 --> 01:10:20.758
[Danny]  So after
the birthday party,

01:10:20.841 --> 01:10:24.386
me and David's communication
became very sporadic.

01:10:25.679 --> 01:10:29.225
He was looking
much more to be the sole
controller of  Gray State.

01:10:29.308 --> 01:10:32.353
He was looking for me to
sign away my rights, um,

01:10:32.436 --> 01:10:34.730
as being the creator and
one of the actors in it,

01:10:34.939 --> 01:10:36.607
and I wouldn't budge on it.

01:10:38.984 --> 01:10:42.613
[Dan Crowley, Sr.]
September 8th, 2014,
there's a journal entry.

01:10:42.821 --> 01:10:45.699
"The universe may
want me to destroy
Danny Mason

01:10:45.783 --> 01:10:49.411
since he has given
indication that he wants
to stand in my way.

01:10:49.703 --> 01:10:50.579
What a fool.

01:10:51.038 --> 01:10:53.123
Convert him to my cause
or destroy him...

01:10:53.207 --> 01:10:55.084
his next actions
will decide."

01:10:56.543 --> 01:10:57.795
Sounds worse than it was.

01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:01.215
It was just David
being... creative.

01:11:01.924 --> 01:11:02.841
I think.

01:11:15.562 --> 01:11:17.898
[Adam Shambour]
They were in it together,

01:11:18.649 --> 01:11:20.317
like, the disconnecting.

01:11:20.776 --> 01:11:21.610
Which was weird

01:11:22.111 --> 01:11:25.281
because here they are
disconnected at
the birthday party,

01:11:26.407 --> 01:11:28.200
but yet, they, as a couple,

01:11:28.284 --> 01:11:29.910
are disconnected
from all of us,

01:11:30.619 --> 01:11:33.289
and then it starts just
going downhill from there.

01:11:38.794 --> 01:11:40.838
[Sarah Johnson]  It was
a very drastic change.

01:11:41.171 --> 01:11:42.881
She became very isolated.

01:11:43.048 --> 01:11:44.883
Nobody would
really see her.

01:11:44.967 --> 01:11:46.260
You wouldn't even know
if she was at work

01:11:46.343 --> 01:11:48.345
except for the fact that
she was seeing her patients.

01:11:48.804 --> 01:11:51.432
She would take
the back ways in
and the back ways out.

01:11:52.599 --> 01:11:55.811
If there would have been
any ittle clue...

01:11:56.270 --> 01:11:57.354
if I just would have known

01:11:57.438 --> 01:11:59.231
even about
what it looks like

01:12:00.858 --> 01:12:03.068
for a woman to be
nervous or whatever,

01:12:03.152 --> 01:12:05.863
like, I just...
I didn't know.

01:12:14.038 --> 01:12:17.082
[Dan Crowley, Sr.]
September 30th, 2014,
a journal entry.

01:12:17.374 --> 01:12:19.335
"Utterly bewildered
and spent.

01:12:20.002 --> 01:12:21.795
I think a part
of me is broken.

01:12:22.296 --> 01:12:24.465
People are just
creatures to tolerate

01:12:24.548 --> 01:12:26.592
and get around
so I can be on my way."

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:40.439
[Dan Crowley, Jr.]  I was
going to babysit for him

01:12:41.690 --> 01:12:43.650
and that fell through.

01:12:44.818 --> 01:12:45.903
[David] Go get it!

01:12:46.111 --> 01:12:47.654
[Dan Crowley, Jr.]
After that, it was...

01:12:47.863 --> 01:12:51.367
I would send him a text
here and there, offhandedly,

01:12:51.450 --> 01:12:54.411
and nothing, you know,
I just didn't
hear anything back.

01:12:54.536 --> 01:12:57.456
And that wasn't
out of the ordinary,
you know,

01:12:57.539 --> 01:12:59.792
he gets busy,
he does his writing,

01:12:59.875 --> 01:13:04.671
he gets buried in his work,
so I wasn't concerned.

01:13:04.797 --> 01:13:08.926
I did, um, notice that
he wasn't responding.

01:13:09.343 --> 01:13:10.677
Then it became more of...

01:13:10.928 --> 01:13:12.471
I don't want to say
"pleading" but, like,

01:13:12.554 --> 01:13:14.348
then I began to think
something was wrong.

01:13:23.315 --> 01:13:25.067
[Cory Zurowski]  According
to the police report,

01:13:25.526 --> 01:13:30.239
Komel's sister drives
17 hours from Texas,

01:13:30.322 --> 01:13:32.241
pretty much as
a desperate intervention.

01:13:33.826 --> 01:13:35.452
Her sister's not
returning phone calls,

01:13:35.536 --> 01:13:37.037
they can't get in
contact with David,

01:13:38.205 --> 01:13:40.165
and so she
takes it upon herself

01:13:40.249 --> 01:13:42.334
to drive 17 hours from Texas

01:13:42.418 --> 01:13:43.710
and show up in Apple Valley.

01:13:45.421 --> 01:13:47.631
She gets to the door,
rings the doorbell,

01:13:47.714 --> 01:13:50.384
and Komel is home,

01:13:50.467 --> 01:13:52.511
and who appears
in the door? It's David,

01:13:52.594 --> 01:13:56.723
who ends up telling her,
"No, you can't
see your sister."

01:13:58.183 --> 01:13:59.393
And she never does.

01:14:01.937 --> 01:14:04.064
She came in
late October?

01:14:06.191 --> 01:14:07.693
That's insane.

01:14:08.527 --> 01:14:10.320
Why wouldn't you
let her in the house?

01:14:10.571 --> 01:14:13.240
I mean, what
possible motivation,

01:14:13.323 --> 01:14:15.659
what possible reason
could you have
to explain that?

01:14:16.493 --> 01:14:18.287
Oh, my God.

01:14:27.588 --> 01:14:28.839
[David]  And so...

01:14:29.006 --> 01:14:32.718
the third plot twist,
the third act twist.

01:14:36.013 --> 01:14:38.140
There has to be
a little bit of willingness

01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:40.017
to be killed at the end.

01:14:42.811 --> 01:14:44.938
She's basically
becoming a martyr.

01:14:47.357 --> 01:14:48.942
Don't resist by
taking out a gun,

01:14:49.026 --> 01:14:50.527
resist by letting 'em do it.

01:14:54.698 --> 01:14:57.075
But when she dies,
he lets her go,

01:14:58.076 --> 01:15:00.162
spiritually understanding that

01:15:00.245 --> 01:15:02.498
she got out and
that he will, too.

01:15:06.543 --> 01:15:09.379
I remember saying to her
in her office one day,

01:15:09.463 --> 01:15:11.882
"Komel, I feel like
I'm speaking
to David, not you.

01:15:11.965 --> 01:15:13.300
I want to
speak to Komel."

01:15:14.551 --> 01:15:18.138
And her response was "Why?

01:15:18.222 --> 01:15:19.515
Do you think I'm not
intelligent enough

01:15:19.598 --> 01:15:21.225
to come up
with these things?"

01:15:22.601 --> 01:15:26.188
October 30th, 2014,
there was a journal entry.

01:15:26.438 --> 01:15:29.066
It said "Komel got
raptured today."

01:15:29.483 --> 01:15:30.484
Period.

01:15:30.567 --> 01:15:31.985
"She's still here."

01:15:41.537 --> 01:15:42.913
It's, um...

01:15:43.497 --> 01:15:46.291
Iit was hard to hear when
I first listened because

01:15:47.334 --> 01:15:49.127
there's some
background noise
in the room.

01:15:49.211 --> 01:15:50.587
I didn't realize there was
anything on here.

01:15:58.512 --> 01:16:00.764
[indistinct recording
of David and Komel talking]

01:17:02.451 --> 01:17:05.454
There's another
recording here of David

01:17:05.537 --> 01:17:07.122
right after
this vision happened,

01:17:07.205 --> 01:17:10.542
of going into a room
and trying to
explain right away

01:17:10.626 --> 01:17:14.004
what Komel had said,
and that's here too.

01:17:16.465 --> 01:17:21.720
[David]  2:48 p.m.
30 October, 2014.

01:17:22.512 --> 01:17:24.806
I was just getting back
from Home Depot

01:17:24.890 --> 01:17:26.850
with a bunch of wood
to build the compost bin,

01:17:26.933 --> 01:17:28.268
had lunch with Komel,

01:17:28.518 --> 01:17:33.940
and suddenly she
began to shake and
weep and, um, howl...

01:17:35.692 --> 01:17:37.736
like someone had died.

01:17:37.819 --> 01:17:40.864
And, um, she sat down.

01:17:42.616 --> 01:17:47.245
[sighs]  She said
"This is what rapture is.

01:17:48.705 --> 01:17:49.998
You gotta give me some time."

01:17:51.625 --> 01:17:53.168
-[Komel]  Can I just lay here?
-[David]  Yeah.

01:17:54.544 --> 01:17:56.380
I was just trying to
remember everything.

01:17:57.506 --> 01:17:59.883
Do you want to contribute
and help me remember?

01:18:02.094 --> 01:18:05.180
You said you've come
very far to find me...

01:18:05.972 --> 01:18:07.724
and Rani and I need
to come with you

01:18:07.808 --> 01:18:09.393
and there's not much time.

01:18:09.476 --> 01:18:12.938
Time is not, uh...
Time is not of our world,

01:18:13.105 --> 01:18:15.899
and on some level,
your soul has
committed to mine,

01:18:15.982 --> 01:18:19.444
and we're gonna
go somewhere and
Rani's coming with.

01:18:19.736 --> 01:18:21.279
[Komel]  I was kind of
skeptical, you know,

01:18:21.363 --> 01:18:22.823
trying to make sure
of the source

01:18:22.906 --> 01:18:25.951
from whence it came
was real. I don't know.

01:18:26.034 --> 01:18:29.371
I--I-- My skeptical
side right now,
my scientific side,

01:18:29.454 --> 01:18:31.331
my brain's questioning
where it came from.

01:18:32.374 --> 01:18:34.084
Was it something
to confuse us?

01:18:35.377 --> 01:18:36.586
Am I crazy?

01:18:43.969 --> 01:18:45.262
Sid and Nancy.

01:18:45.345 --> 01:18:47.389
I think what happened
was Sid and Nancy.

01:18:47.597 --> 01:18:50.892
Um, I don't mean this
to speak ill of Komel,
rest her soul.

01:18:50.976 --> 01:18:53.520
I don't mean this to
speak ill of David,
rest his soul,

01:18:53.687 --> 01:18:54.980
and their daughter...

01:18:55.063 --> 01:18:56.606
but something
was planned.

01:18:59.776 --> 01:19:02.195
[Susan Houghton]  I think
Komel was in
a hopeless situation

01:19:02.279 --> 01:19:07.492
and was just pretty much
isolated with him.

01:19:07.909 --> 01:19:09.911
No friends, no family,

01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:12.914
and I think that
she was hopeless.

01:19:24.259 --> 01:19:25.844
[Mason Hendricks]
The last time I was
at his house,

01:19:25.927 --> 01:19:27.554
I went and brought him
some lenses back,

01:19:27.721 --> 01:19:29.181
and that was in
early November,

01:19:29.264 --> 01:19:30.474
and I remember
looking at David
and thinking,

01:19:30.557 --> 01:19:32.017
"Wow, you look like shit."

01:19:33.351 --> 01:19:36.104
[Dan Crowley, Sr.]
November 2nd of 2014.

01:19:36.396 --> 01:19:37.731
A journal entry.

01:19:38.482 --> 01:19:40.901
"The world is an inverse
perversion of light.

01:19:41.067 --> 01:19:42.944
We are made of it
and its weakness...

01:19:43.153 --> 01:19:45.405
a flashlight in
the mind of Satan.

01:19:45.655 --> 01:19:47.073
But I am darkness."

01:19:49.284 --> 01:19:51.703
I mean, hindsight's 20/20,

01:19:51.787 --> 01:19:53.371
but at the same time,

01:19:53.455 --> 01:19:56.792
when you're locked off
from this person
for months at a time

01:19:56.875 --> 01:19:58.293
and they're not letting--

01:19:58.376 --> 01:20:02.088
They literally cut himself
off from everyone,

01:20:02.339 --> 01:20:03.840
like deactivated
his Facebook,

01:20:03.924 --> 01:20:05.217
wasn't answering
phone calls,

01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:06.301
wasn't doing anything,

01:20:06.384 --> 01:20:07.803
wasn't seeing his family...

01:20:08.678 --> 01:20:09.971
What do you do?

01:20:11.264 --> 01:20:13.391
[Sean Wright]
The last time I saw him
was late November.

01:20:13.767 --> 01:20:16.228
I'd been over there
a few times where he's
in the middle of something

01:20:16.311 --> 01:20:17.229
he's working on,

01:20:17.312 --> 01:20:20.190
and just "Whoop!
Don't talk, I'll be
present in a little bit.

01:20:20.273 --> 01:20:21.525
Just don't disturb me,

01:20:21.608 --> 01:20:22.818
you know, I need my time.

01:20:22.901 --> 01:20:23.985
Don't really need
anybody unannounced."

01:20:24.069 --> 01:20:25.946
It was more of kind of
putting up a wall.

01:20:26.279 --> 01:20:27.322
But...

01:20:31.034 --> 01:20:32.494
[interviewer]
But what?

01:20:33.787 --> 01:20:36.540
Just... emotions, man.

01:20:36.623 --> 01:20:38.583
So... [laughs]

01:20:38.875 --> 01:20:40.210
Fuck off for a second.

01:20:43.964 --> 01:20:46.591
December 7th of 2014...

01:20:47.509 --> 01:20:50.762
The last pictures David
took on his cell phone

01:20:51.471 --> 01:20:53.014
were of Komel.

01:20:53.431 --> 01:20:55.058
She seemed happy
in the pictures

01:20:55.141 --> 01:20:57.227
and David used one
of those pictures

01:20:57.310 --> 01:20:59.521
on his phone
as the background.

01:21:02.899 --> 01:21:05.277
Komel was on edge,
he was on edge.

01:21:05.443 --> 01:21:08.989
He was thin,
eyes were sunken in.

01:21:09.072 --> 01:21:09.906
I mean...

01:21:09.990 --> 01:21:11.283
and that's when
I approached him.

01:21:11.366 --> 01:21:12.868
I said,
"You know what, David?

01:21:13.326 --> 01:21:15.036
You told me to speak up

01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:19.291
whenever I noticed
you start going into
your dark place again."

01:21:19.541 --> 01:21:21.209
I said "Danny's
worried about you,

01:21:21.293 --> 01:21:22.878
I'm worried about you."

01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:25.005
You know, "What's
going on, man?"

01:21:25.088 --> 01:21:27.007
And he literally
looked at me and said

01:21:27.716 --> 01:21:29.885
"You and Danny
have nothing to
fucking worry about.

01:21:29.968 --> 01:21:31.052
I'm fine."

01:21:32.429 --> 01:21:34.681
[Susan Houghton]
When Komel met me
around Thanksgiving,

01:21:34.764 --> 01:21:37.767
she looked... sad.

01:21:37.851 --> 01:21:40.186
She looked uncomfortable.

01:21:40.353 --> 01:21:41.813
I didn't know
what to ask her.

01:21:41.897 --> 01:21:43.607
I was just trying
to keep her there.

01:21:49.154 --> 01:21:50.113
So...

01:21:50.989 --> 01:21:53.241
I don't want to start
crying right now, though.

01:21:54.576 --> 01:21:57.746
So I don't want to
talk about that anymore.

01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:01.374
[Dan Crowley, Sr.]
December 19th, 2014.

01:22:01.583 --> 01:22:03.793
David and Komel pick up
their daughter Raniya

01:22:03.877 --> 01:22:06.546
from their last day
of school before
the Christmas holidays.

01:22:06.630 --> 01:22:10.926
That was the last time
they were seen by
anyone that we know.

01:22:16.598 --> 01:22:18.725
Driving to his house
on Christmas Eve

01:22:19.225 --> 01:22:20.936
there was a voice
in my head...

01:22:21.519 --> 01:22:23.313
I don't know if I
want to talk about this.

01:22:26.232 --> 01:22:28.068
So when I was
driving to his house

01:22:28.234 --> 01:22:31.237
on Christmas Eve,
I had a feeling like...

01:22:31.696 --> 01:22:34.574
that I needed to go
to his house,

01:22:35.408 --> 01:22:38.036
and just tell him
that I loved him.

01:22:38.662 --> 01:22:39.788
[laughs]

01:22:40.205 --> 01:22:42.582
And by the time
I got close enough,

01:22:42.666 --> 01:22:44.209
I had talked myself
out of it,

01:22:44.292 --> 01:22:46.169
and I said I'll just
stop by another time.

01:22:46.670 --> 01:22:51.508
Um... so, yeah. I wonder.

01:23:03.269 --> 01:23:05.397
December 25th, 2014.

01:23:05.772 --> 01:23:08.108
David's up early
in the morning as usual,

01:23:08.191 --> 01:23:13.029
and was planning
his  Gray State  future.

01:23:13.655 --> 01:23:14.781
And he writes, uh,

01:23:14.864 --> 01:23:17.742
"Christmas: 6-day countdown.

01:23:18.284 --> 01:23:20.870
Meme: It will be a new year."

01:23:21.496 --> 01:23:23.289
And he proceeded
to make a plan

01:23:23.373 --> 01:23:26.334
for every day
until the New Year.

01:23:26.876 --> 01:23:29.629
And he also made
a plan that went
way beyond that.

01:23:31.423 --> 01:23:36.720
Later that morning,
David kills his family
and then himself.

01:23:39.139 --> 01:23:41.933
[flips page]

01:23:45.353 --> 01:23:46.187
That's it.

01:23:50.066 --> 01:23:52.068
[David]  It's an idea
going throughout.

01:23:52.152 --> 01:23:56.990
Like, how can life
keep emerging,

01:23:57.073 --> 01:23:59.159
how can it keep cropping
up in new forms,

01:23:59.242 --> 01:24:01.077
especially with
the way things are?

01:24:01.411 --> 01:24:03.496
But life has
that sort of, uh,

01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:10.837
nature of resilience
and persistence.

01:24:11.504 --> 01:24:15.216
It's always popping
up, even though
our circumstances--

01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:16.551
And it's through that,

01:24:16.926 --> 01:24:18.928
that changes are inevitable.

01:24:23.933 --> 01:24:26.144
I got a call from my dad.

01:24:26.770 --> 01:24:28.521
He asked if
I was sitting down.

01:24:29.355 --> 01:24:31.357
He says "David..."

01:24:32.567 --> 01:24:35.278
and I was like "Oh,"
and then he goes "Komel,"

01:24:35.361 --> 01:24:36.613
and I was like, "Ah."

01:24:36.821 --> 01:24:39.824
"And Rani." And I just...

01:24:42.202 --> 01:24:44.788
It was-- I've never
been stabbed,

01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:48.166
but it felt like
something was going
into my stomach

01:24:48.249 --> 01:24:52.670
with each name and
I couldn't breathe,

01:24:54.464 --> 01:24:55.799
and I just thought...

01:24:56.633 --> 01:24:58.384
this is like
scripted almost.

01:25:00.929 --> 01:25:02.806
[narrator]  Apple Valley Police
recently closed

01:25:02.889 --> 01:25:05.433
their exhaustive
year-long investigation

01:25:05.517 --> 01:25:07.685
and for the first time,
we're sharing their findings

01:25:07.769 --> 01:25:09.562
with the Fox 9 Investigators.

01:25:09.896 --> 01:25:13.233
It looks like David,
uh, snapped,

01:25:13.566 --> 01:25:16.277
and took the lives of
his wife and daughter

01:25:16.361 --> 01:25:17.737
and then ultimately himself.

01:25:18.029 --> 01:25:20.156
Who wrote "Allah Akbar"
on the wall?

01:25:20.824 --> 01:25:21.825
He did.

01:25:22.158 --> 01:25:23.701
-In her blood.
-Yes.

01:25:23.868 --> 01:25:25.161
Why did he do that?

01:25:26.913 --> 01:25:31.584
We believe that was just
kind of a parting shot.

01:25:36.297 --> 01:25:38.591
[Tom Lydon]  David Crowley
seemed like
he was very specific

01:25:38.675 --> 01:25:40.009
in how he wanted
to be perceived

01:25:40.093 --> 01:25:41.344
to the outside world.

01:25:45.598 --> 01:25:48.977
It was almost like David
gave us this plot twist

01:25:49.269 --> 01:25:51.938
at the end of
"Allah Akbar,"

01:25:52.647 --> 01:25:56.151
you know, this plot twist
that wasn't gonna
have any resolution,

01:25:56.776 --> 01:26:00.071
but that people would
continue talking about.

01:26:02.574 --> 01:26:04.826
[Greg Fernandez Jr]
Who walks into a house
and sees "Allah Akbar"

01:26:04.909 --> 01:26:07.245
written on a wall
and goes, "Oh, yeah...

01:26:07.328 --> 01:26:09.414
David Crowley's someone
who is not a Muslim,

01:26:09.539 --> 01:26:11.666
all of a sudden,
now he's writing it

01:26:11.749 --> 01:26:15.295
and that somehow
proves that he's guilty?

01:26:15.461 --> 01:26:19.090
David Crowley would
not write "Allah Akbar"

01:26:19.674 --> 01:26:22.844
in his wife's blood on the wall
and leave a Quran open.

01:26:22.927 --> 01:26:25.013
He never brought up
that issue once.

01:26:29.392 --> 01:26:30.768
[Cory Zurowski]
So what does it mean?

01:26:33.021 --> 01:26:34.772
To me it was...

01:26:35.148 --> 01:26:40.862
my thinking is that
it was throwing off
the chains of pressure,

01:26:40.945 --> 01:26:44.115
pressure from
delivering this movie,

01:26:44.574 --> 01:26:48.286
pressure from
people telling him he
had to make this movie,

01:26:49.162 --> 01:26:53.124
pressure as a man who
has to provide for his family,

01:26:54.292 --> 01:26:55.877
and I think he was...

01:26:56.044 --> 01:26:58.713
emancipating himself
from all of it.

01:27:01.049 --> 01:27:02.717
[Joe Seaton]
David planned ahead.

01:27:03.718 --> 01:27:06.596
David was ten steps ahead,
twelve steps ahead.

01:27:07.263 --> 01:27:09.015
And his military training,

01:27:09.098 --> 01:27:10.225
if it taught me
the same thing

01:27:10.308 --> 01:27:11.768
I guarantee it taught
him the same thing.

01:27:11.851 --> 01:27:13.937
You have alternate
courses of action

01:27:14.020 --> 01:27:15.897
for every event that occurs.

01:27:19.275 --> 01:27:20.193
[Komel]  Are you excited?

01:27:21.444 --> 01:27:22.737
We're up here!

01:27:22.820 --> 01:27:24.113
Yeah.

01:27:24.405 --> 01:27:25.823
[David] You guys say "Whoo!"

01:27:25.907 --> 01:27:27.700
Whoo!

01:27:34.624 --> 01:27:36.459
I don't think
you're missing anything.

01:27:36.542 --> 01:27:40.463
I mean, you're coming up
with a good, solid
timeline for everything.

01:27:40.546 --> 01:27:42.715
You're interviewing all of us.

01:27:42.882 --> 01:27:45.301
The only thing
you're missing is "Why?"

01:27:46.386 --> 01:27:47.971
And you're never
gonna know why.

01:27:48.513 --> 01:27:49.889
I'm not, you're not...

01:27:49.973 --> 01:27:51.766
Danny, everybody, family,

01:27:51.849 --> 01:27:53.351
nobody's gonna know why.

01:27:54.686 --> 01:27:57.313
That's the only thing
that you're not
gonna have there.

01:28:00.358 --> 01:28:02.568
[Tom Lydon] And this
is the strange thing.

01:28:02.819 --> 01:28:04.737
It's almost like he
created a soundtrack

01:28:04.821 --> 01:28:06.364
to the murder-suicide.

01:28:06.948 --> 01:28:08.908
You know, something
called "Ascent."

01:28:10.702 --> 01:28:13.746
This music probably
played for hours,

01:28:13.830 --> 01:28:15.832
maybe days after
they were dead.

01:28:16.666 --> 01:28:19.544
Was he imagining
these 53 songs

01:28:20.086 --> 01:28:22.797
as the songs that
he would play

01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:24.716
while he's committing
a murder-suicide?

01:28:25.717 --> 01:28:26.843
It's hard to know.

01:28:26.926 --> 01:28:28.386
I mean, this was on a loop.

01:28:28.845 --> 01:28:30.596
Who plans a soundtrack

01:28:31.264 --> 01:28:32.807
for the murder
of their family?

01:28:35.685 --> 01:28:39.230
I don't know.
I don't know.

more than most people.

01:30:18.746 --> 01:30:19.997
