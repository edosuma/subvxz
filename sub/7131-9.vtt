WEBVTT

00:11.959 --> 00:14.542
Oh, look.
There's your girlfriend.

00:14.542 --> 00:15.875
She's not my--

00:15.875 --> 00:19.125
Ooh, ooh. Hoo hoo!
Almost got me there.

00:19.125 --> 00:20.041
Almost.

00:20.041 --> 00:23.166
She's got this idea--
[chuckles]

00:23.166 --> 00:25.792
You might be--

00:25.792 --> 00:27.458
- What?
- In love with me.

00:27.458 --> 00:30.375
In love with you?
[laughs]

00:30.375 --> 00:32.333
Well, you don't have to
say it like that.

00:32.333 --> 00:34.834
Promise me you will
stay away from Carol.

00:34.834 --> 00:36.125
She's my friend.

00:36.125 --> 00:37.917
I'm begging you.
The last thing you need

00:37.917 --> 00:40.000
is to get
between two lesbians.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.959
Or 1 1/2 lesbians,
or whatever Carol is right now.

00:42.959 --> 00:44.834
I'm not gonna be
a fucking game show host.

00:44.834 --> 00:46.917
This could be
serious money for you,

00:46.917 --> 00:50.750
and right now,
you need serious money.

00:50.750 --> 00:53.250
I don't have to like you.
You don't have to like me.

00:53.250 --> 00:54.291
Not to worry.

00:54.291 --> 00:55.875
We are professional.

00:55.875 --> 00:57.917
Like two old whores.

00:57.917 --> 00:59.542
Who won't we fuck?

00:59.542 --> 01:01.709
[both laughing]

01:01.709 --> 01:02.875
I'm excited about this.

01:02.875 --> 01:05.000
I know you are.

01:07.125 --> 01:10.083
[keys clacking]

01:16.500 --> 01:20.041
[wind blows]

01:20.041 --> 01:22.875
[quirky music]

01:22.875 --> 01:31.083
â™ª â™ª

01:46.750 --> 01:49.041
[gunshot]

01:59.542 --> 02:01.750
Hi.
[giggles]

02:01.750 --> 02:04.041
By the way,
enjoy this,

02:04.041 --> 02:06.125
because it's the last time
I am meeting you here.

02:06.125 --> 02:08.041
I think it's fun.

02:08.041 --> 02:10.709
Fun doesn't usually
smell like this.

02:10.709 --> 02:12.333
So you pick a place.

02:12.333 --> 02:14.792
Well, you have to agree,
it's insane.

02:14.792 --> 02:18.041
At what point can we stop living
in fear of your girlfriend?

02:18.041 --> 02:20.458
Uh--uh, excuse me?

02:20.458 --> 02:21.792
Hi.

02:21.792 --> 02:23.959
Would you give
us a moment, please?

02:23.959 --> 02:26.792
We're kind of using
this space.

02:30.125 --> 02:32.333
Okay.

02:33.875 --> 02:35.208
All right.

02:35.208 --> 02:36.875
I am just--

02:36.875 --> 02:40.083
[clatter]

02:42.083 --> 02:43.583
I am just--

02:43.583 --> 02:46.000
[clatter]

02:46.000 --> 02:49.333
I am--I am just--
put--put--

02:51.291 --> 02:54.625
[slamming]

02:54.625 --> 02:56.792
Ooh.
[chuckles]

03:00.041 --> 03:01.834
- Okay.
- All right.

03:01.834 --> 03:04.500
I am just putting this
out there.

03:04.500 --> 03:07.667
Tomorrow morning,
I am going on a hike by myself,

03:07.667 --> 03:12.125
alone, 7:30,
our usual spot.

03:12.125 --> 03:14.000
Do with that what you will.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.041
Okay, got ya.
[clicks tongue]

03:17.041 --> 03:18.583
Let me say this.

03:18.583 --> 03:21.834
Life was simpler
before you became a lesbian.

03:21.834 --> 03:24.750
A lesbian?
[laughs]

03:24.750 --> 03:25.959
I'm not a lesbian.

03:25.959 --> 03:28.709
Really?
What would you call it?

03:28.709 --> 03:31.041
I don't know.

03:31.041 --> 03:33.208
I feel uncomfortable
with labels.

03:33.208 --> 03:36.375
Well, label or not,
if you open a can

03:36.375 --> 03:40.333
and there's beans in it,
it's a can of beans.

03:42.917 --> 03:46.000
[coughs]

03:54.458 --> 03:54.542
Where were you?

03:55.959 --> 03:59.834
Uh, just stepped out
for some fresh air.

04:06.208 --> 04:07.834
What?

04:13.917 --> 04:16.667
Once the contestants
are in the boxes,

04:16.667 --> 04:18.041
we begin
the questionings.

04:18.041 --> 04:19.000
- Okay.
- Yeah.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.208
(Merc)
You ask them questions.

04:20.208 --> 04:22.250
If they get them right,
they get points.

04:22.250 --> 04:24.917
By the way, it's obviously
too late for the pilot,

04:24.917 --> 04:26.291
but if this thing goes,

04:26.291 --> 04:28.917
maybe think about a few trips
to the gym.

04:28.917 --> 04:31.291
[chuckles]
I fucking go to the gym.

04:31.291 --> 04:32.875
Yeah, well, maybe
less with the juice bar

04:32.875 --> 04:34.125
and more with the machines.

04:34.125 --> 04:35.917
[chuckles]
Just saying.

04:35.917 --> 04:36.917
[both chuckling]

04:36.917 --> 04:38.208
Seriously?

04:38.208 --> 04:40.583
This is coming from you?
Just saying.

04:40.583 --> 04:43.125
Hey, I'm not the one
in front of the camera.

04:43.125 --> 04:44.458
I don't have to be pretty.

04:44.458 --> 04:46.667
- Mission accomplished.
- Uh.

04:46.667 --> 04:48.125
Gentlemen?

04:48.125 --> 04:49.250
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

04:49.250 --> 04:50.875
Go on.

04:50.875 --> 04:54.125
The contestants can use
their advantages in two ways.

04:54.125 --> 04:58.083
A, they can acquire necessities
for themselves.

04:58.083 --> 04:59.208
Like a blanket,
a chair, food.

04:59.208 --> 05:01.500
Or B, they can use
their advantages

05:01.500 --> 05:03.834
to punish
the other contestants.

05:03.834 --> 05:05.792
They can make the other boxes
colder, hotter,

05:05.792 --> 05:07.208
or fill them with bugs.

05:07.208 --> 05:08.208
Really?
Bugs?

05:08.208 --> 05:11.208
Oh, yeah, yeah.
They always go for the bugs.

05:11.208 --> 05:12.959
And then you say,
"Release the bugs,"

05:12.959 --> 05:14.542
and the audience goes,
"Release the bugs!"

05:14.542 --> 05:15.750
[Speaking Dutch]

05:15.750 --> 05:19.166
And then you do not want to be
in that fucking box.

05:19.166 --> 05:21.000
Jesus.
Can they get out?

05:21.000 --> 05:22.500
The bugs or the people?

05:22.500 --> 05:23.667
Either.

05:23.667 --> 05:25.333
No.

05:28.792 --> 05:31.834
Okay, don't look,
but there is a guy

05:31.834 --> 05:35.000
who has been staring at you
for the last ten minutes.

05:35.000 --> 05:35.875
- Me?
- Uh-huh.

05:35.875 --> 05:37.500
Oh, he's getting up.

05:37.500 --> 05:40.417
He's coming over here,
and if it's who I think it is--

05:40.417 --> 05:42.458
- Carol?
- [gasps] Oh.

05:42.458 --> 05:44.333
- It is.
- That's totally fair.

05:44.333 --> 05:45.834
- I'm so sorry to interrupt.
- [laughs]

05:45.834 --> 05:46.834
I just--
I had to say hello.

05:46.834 --> 05:48.667
Oh, my god.
Hi.

05:48.667 --> 05:50.000
[both laughing]

05:50.000 --> 05:52.291
Helen Basch,
Castor Sotto.

05:52.291 --> 05:53.583
Oh, it's nice
to finally meet you.

05:53.583 --> 05:55.333
- You too.
- How's my old office?

05:55.333 --> 05:57.834
I'll bet you're still
picking pills out of the rug.

05:57.834 --> 05:59.625
It's like Liza Minnelli's
dressing room.

05:59.625 --> 06:02.500
[laughter]

06:02.500 --> 06:05.291
I also wanted to apologize
for--

06:07.000 --> 06:08.375
I don't even know
where to start.

06:08.375 --> 06:11.000
What I put
this poor woman through.

06:11.000 --> 06:11.959
I'm sure she's told you.

06:11.959 --> 06:14.667
Maybe a few
colorful highlights.

06:14.667 --> 06:17.208
Oh, I was a nightmare.

06:17.208 --> 06:20.208
But you were amazing
through all of it.

06:20.208 --> 06:23.083
Wow.
[laughs]

06:23.083 --> 06:26.041
You seem like you're
doing much better now.

06:26.041 --> 06:28.166
Much.
I'm back on my meds.

06:28.166 --> 06:29.250
I even started
some new meds.

06:29.250 --> 06:30.291
Couldn't hurt.

06:30.291 --> 06:31.250
[both laughing]

06:31.250 --> 06:33.709
No argument there.

06:33.709 --> 06:36.500
Well, I'm--I'm happy
you're doing well.

06:36.500 --> 06:39.417
Actually, really well.
I'm not supposed to say,

06:39.417 --> 06:42.709
but I just found out
I'm gonna be running the CW.

06:42.709 --> 06:43.875
(both)
No!

06:43.875 --> 06:45.875
Wh-what happened to--

06:45.875 --> 06:48.709
No, he's going over to ABC.
It's all very hush-hush still.

06:48.709 --> 06:50.750
They're gonna be making
the announcement next week.

06:50.750 --> 06:51.750
Wow.

06:51.750 --> 06:53.375
Congratulations.

06:53.375 --> 06:54.709
Thanks.
I know, it's crazy.

06:54.709 --> 06:56.875
But better that kind
of crazy than my usual.

06:56.875 --> 06:58.250
[shudders]

06:58.250 --> 07:01.291
[laughter]

07:01.291 --> 07:04.166
Ohh. Anyway,
I'll let you get back to it.

07:04.166 --> 07:07.667
Again, I just wanted to say
I'm so sorry for everything.

07:07.667 --> 07:09.333
- It's fine.
- Mm, it's not.

07:09.333 --> 07:13.291
No, but thank you
for saying something.

07:13.291 --> 07:15.458
Take care.
Nice meeting you.

07:15.458 --> 07:16.750
You too.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.542
Five second rule.

07:20.625 --> 07:23.917
Three, four, five.
Holy shit.

07:23.917 --> 07:25.417
Bet you didn't see
that coming.

07:25.417 --> 07:28.417
They're letting him
run a network again?

07:28.417 --> 07:31.250
They rolled him out of ours
strapped to a thing

07:31.250 --> 07:32.542
like Hannibal Lecter.

07:32.542 --> 07:34.959
By the way,
he's much hotter in person.

07:34.959 --> 07:37.542
Oh, yeah, he's dreamy.

07:39.750 --> 07:41.417
For a guy.

07:41.417 --> 07:43.041
Please.
Whoa.

07:43.041 --> 07:45.709
Thank you, no.
[laughs]

07:45.709 --> 07:48.625
Ick.
Seriously.

07:48.625 --> 07:50.083
We should get a check.

07:54.458 --> 07:55.625
[phone ringing]

07:55.625 --> 07:58.208
Oh.

07:58.208 --> 07:59.500
Aah.

07:59.500 --> 08:00.291
Hello?

08:00.291 --> 08:03.583
Hey, it's me.
Can you talk?

08:03.583 --> 08:05.333
Uh, sure.

08:05.333 --> 08:06.959
(Castor)
I have a question for you.

08:06.959 --> 08:08.291
I couldn't ask
in front of Helen,

08:08.291 --> 08:11.125
and I may be
way out of line here,

08:11.125 --> 08:13.625
but...I'd like
to offer you a job.

08:13.625 --> 08:15.250
I'm actually
seeing someone.

08:15.250 --> 08:16.875
- I'm sorry, what?
- What?

08:16.875 --> 08:18.333
(Castor)
I didn't hear what you said.

08:18.333 --> 08:20.291
You're offering me a job?

08:20.291 --> 08:23.375
Yes. I'd love for you to be
my number two again.

08:23.375 --> 08:25.291
They said I can bring in
anyone I want.

08:25.291 --> 08:27.875
I'll pay you twice
what you're getting now.

08:27.875 --> 08:29.959
I need you here.

08:29.959 --> 08:31.542
[chuckles]

08:31.542 --> 08:34.542
I'm really flattered...

08:34.542 --> 08:38.208
but I'm very happy
where I am.

08:38.208 --> 08:40.500
I love working for Helen.

08:40.500 --> 08:43.000
I could never--
literally twice?

08:43.000 --> 08:44.583
I want you to be happy.

08:44.583 --> 08:46.917
No, no, I can't.
I--

08:46.917 --> 08:48.375
Look, I get that you have
trepidations.

08:48.375 --> 08:50.208
How could you not?
But I still think

08:50.208 --> 08:52.959
we could make
a hell of a team.

08:52.959 --> 08:56.166
I promise I can be the person
you thought I was.

08:57.959 --> 08:59.166
Even so, I--

08:59.166 --> 09:00.291
At least think about it.

09:00.291 --> 09:03.709
If it's a no,
I totally understand.

09:03.709 --> 09:06.500
But until it is,

09:06.500 --> 09:09.709
I'm hoping it's a yes.

09:15.041 --> 09:17.542
So, excited
about tomorrow night?

09:19.166 --> 09:21.542
So, depressed and morose
about tomorrow night?

09:21.542 --> 09:23.542
There you go.

09:23.542 --> 09:26.375
What exactly is this game?

09:26.375 --> 09:29.333
It's just seven idiots
trying to stay

09:29.333 --> 09:33.542
inside these boxes
for 17 weeks.

09:33.542 --> 09:35.834
And they're in the boxes
the whole time?

09:35.834 --> 09:37.542
- Yup.
- Dear God.

09:37.542 --> 09:40.375
Why would someone do that?

09:40.375 --> 09:42.041
Money, to be on TV.

09:42.041 --> 09:43.333
[scoffs]

09:43.333 --> 09:46.250
I know, it's crazy.

09:46.250 --> 09:48.917
Although...

09:48.917 --> 09:50.250
What?

09:50.250 --> 09:53.834
Well, you're willing to be
a game show host

09:53.834 --> 09:55.750
for money
and to be on TV.

09:55.750 --> 09:57.834
It's a little bit
different.

09:57.834 --> 09:59.417
Is it?

09:59.417 --> 10:02.250
Well, for one thing,
I'm making a shitload of money.

10:02.250 --> 10:03.375
Well, I'm sure for them,

10:03.375 --> 10:06.792
whatever they're getting
is a shitload of money.

10:06.792 --> 10:10.125
Yeah, well,
I'm not stuck in a box.

10:10.125 --> 10:12.125
Mm.

10:12.125 --> 10:13.959
What?

10:13.959 --> 10:15.417
Not a literal box,

10:15.417 --> 10:17.750
but you're trapped
doing this thing

10:17.750 --> 10:21.667
you don't want to do
in front of everybody,

10:21.667 --> 10:25.166
with no way out.

10:25.166 --> 10:26.375
What are you doing?

10:26.375 --> 10:28.625
Nothing.
I just think it's ironic.

10:28.625 --> 10:30.291
Hmm.

10:30.291 --> 10:32.000
You know what else
is ironic?

10:32.000 --> 10:33.333
What?

10:33.333 --> 10:34.667
Ooh.

10:36.583 --> 10:40.166
(Sean)
Um, that's not actually
what irony is.

10:46.959 --> 10:49.250
Hey.
[giggles]

10:49.250 --> 10:52.208
Look at you, all gutsy.

10:52.208 --> 10:54.083
I wasn't sure
you were gonna turn up.

10:54.083 --> 10:55.667
I know.

10:55.667 --> 10:57.041
It's like all those years

10:57.041 --> 10:59.709
sneaking around
with married guys.

10:59.709 --> 11:01.917
It kind of makes me feel
alive again.

11:03.792 --> 11:06.667
Also, Helen's in New York
at an affiliates' meeting.

11:06.667 --> 11:07.750
So not that gutsy.

11:07.750 --> 11:08.750
Oh, so what?

11:08.750 --> 11:11.208
[snickers]

11:11.208 --> 11:15.500
Look, I swore I would never
give you advice again.

11:15.500 --> 11:16.875
Nobody believed that.

11:16.875 --> 11:20.125
Well, good, because if you
take this job with Castor,

11:20.125 --> 11:21.542
you're as crazy as he is.

11:21.542 --> 11:24.500
First of all,
it's twice the money.

11:24.500 --> 11:27.500
No, first of all,
it's Castor!

11:27.500 --> 11:29.959
He seems fine.

11:29.959 --> 11:33.709
Plus, it might be good
for me and Helen

11:33.709 --> 11:35.542
not to be together
all the time.

11:35.542 --> 11:38.500
Oh, no.
It's--it's a brilliant plan.

11:38.500 --> 11:39.667
Yeah.

11:39.667 --> 11:42.792
You going to work
for your male ex-lover?

11:42.792 --> 11:44.250
[laughs]
That won't feed

11:44.250 --> 11:46.750
her already
spectacular paranoia.

11:46.750 --> 11:48.166
I'm just saying, I think--

11:48.166 --> 11:49.125
Hi, girls.

11:49.125 --> 11:51.500
[both screaming]

11:51.500 --> 11:53.166
What a warm welcome.

11:53.166 --> 11:54.750
Oh, God.

11:54.750 --> 11:55.834
What are you doing here?

11:55.834 --> 11:58.583
I think the question is
what are you doing here?

11:58.583 --> 12:01.458
Ha ha ha ha ha.
What are we both doing here?

12:01.458 --> 12:03.875
Look, this is not
what you think.

12:03.875 --> 12:05.583
It has never been
what you think.

12:05.583 --> 12:07.875
This is just
a bloody haircut.

12:07.875 --> 12:10.250
It's not like I'm wearing
a strap-on on my head.

12:10.250 --> 12:11.542
[both laughing uncomfortably]

12:11.542 --> 12:15.041
Pubey, I swear,
there is nothing going on.

12:15.041 --> 12:17.458
It's just two friends
on a hike.

12:17.458 --> 12:18.542
Bullshit!

12:18.542 --> 12:20.834
Two friends do not
sneak off on a hike.

12:20.834 --> 12:22.375
And you can drop
the "Pubey."

12:22.375 --> 12:23.500
Probably for the best.

12:23.500 --> 12:24.792
You said you were gonna be
at a breakfast meeting

12:24.792 --> 12:25.709
this morning.

12:25.709 --> 12:27.500
Well, you said you were
in New York.

12:27.500 --> 12:29.500
And look what happened.

12:29.500 --> 12:31.875
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

12:31.875 --> 12:34.125
I'm done.
You can have her.

12:34.125 --> 12:34.959
I don't want her.

12:34.959 --> 12:36.375
Well, I don't
want her either.

12:36.375 --> 12:37.333
Oh, come on!

12:37.333 --> 12:40.417
What I want is all your shit
out of my house.

12:40.417 --> 12:41.208
Can we please talk--

12:41.208 --> 12:42.583
Today.

12:42.583 --> 12:46.250
Your cheap moisturizer,
your stupid sleep goggles,

12:46.250 --> 12:48.875
and especially
that fucking scrunchie!

12:50.208 --> 12:51.375
Really?

12:53.750 --> 12:54.792
Okay.

12:54.792 --> 12:58.375
And I would like
my ankle bracelet back.

12:58.375 --> 12:59.792
Seriously?

13:02.208 --> 13:05.250
I...okay.

13:12.375 --> 13:13.750
And I believe that's my top.

13:13.750 --> 13:15.667
[scoffs]

13:15.667 --> 13:17.458
Fine.
I'll bring it to the office.

13:17.458 --> 13:18.667
- Now.
- Now?

13:18.667 --> 13:19.959
Now.

13:19.959 --> 13:20.959
No.

13:20.959 --> 13:22.458
- Now!
- Okay.

13:22.458 --> 13:24.834
I...I--

13:30.250 --> 13:33.250
Here you go.

13:33.250 --> 13:34.291
My bra.

13:34.291 --> 13:35.500
Oh, come on.

13:35.500 --> 13:36.875
Do you want to start
with me?

13:36.875 --> 13:38.792
- Give her the bra.
- Wha--I--

13:38.792 --> 13:39.959
Bra.

13:51.125 --> 13:52.917
She's all yours.

14:00.208 --> 14:01.333
I'm so sorry.

14:01.333 --> 14:03.291
I'm fine.

14:06.166 --> 14:09.125
The car is so far away.

14:10.417 --> 14:13.208
(female voice over PA)
Securing the boxes.

14:13.208 --> 14:14.583
Up 10%.

14:14.583 --> 14:17.041
(female voice over PA)
Securing the boxes.

14:17.041 --> 14:18.959
[laughs]
Hey.

14:18.959 --> 14:20.375
There's our star.

14:20.375 --> 14:22.667
[laughs]

14:22.667 --> 14:25.125
Ah.
What's with the vest?

14:25.125 --> 14:26.000
What do you mean?

14:26.000 --> 14:27.458
The vest.
[chuckles]

14:27.458 --> 14:28.917
I never approved that.

14:28.917 --> 14:30.834
I didn't approve
of what you approved.

14:30.834 --> 14:33.667
[chuckles]
Seriously, lose the vest.

14:33.667 --> 14:34.834
I like the vest.

14:34.834 --> 14:37.458
I'm telling you,
the vest is not your friend.

14:37.458 --> 14:38.750
It's classy.

14:38.750 --> 14:40.000
- It's thickening.
- It's Armani.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.917
Well, then,
let him fucking wear it.

14:41.917 --> 14:43.542
I got to say,
I'm looking at my reflection

14:43.542 --> 14:45.542
on your forehead,
and I think I look good.

14:45.542 --> 14:46.917
[chuckles]

14:46.917 --> 14:48.375
Trust me on this.

14:48.375 --> 14:50.333
I've got your best interests
at heart.

14:53.875 --> 14:54.959
Okay.

14:54.959 --> 14:57.375
Appreciate it.

14:57.375 --> 14:59.083
Cocksucker.

15:00.625 --> 15:02.875
[British accent]
Oh, look who's here.

15:02.875 --> 15:04.542
It's Downton Abbey.

15:04.542 --> 15:06.542
Why, why, why, why, why?

15:06.542 --> 15:08.208
Come here.

15:08.208 --> 15:10.125
[chuckles]

15:10.125 --> 15:12.041
I heard about the new show.

15:12.041 --> 15:14.041
Very exciting.
Tell me.

15:14.041 --> 15:16.125
Uh, uh, well,
it's a project

15:16.125 --> 15:17.875
we actually developed
in England,

15:17.875 --> 15:19.583
and everyone loved it, but
nothing seemed to be happening,

15:19.583 --> 15:20.750
and then, remarkably--

15:20.750 --> 15:23.041
Sounds great.
Excuse me a sec.

15:23.041 --> 15:24.875
Mrs. Basch.

15:24.875 --> 15:27.250
Oh, Mr. Lapidus.

15:27.250 --> 15:28.875
So, how's it going?

15:28.875 --> 15:30.083
Fantastic.

15:30.083 --> 15:31.500
You and Matt having fun?

15:31.500 --> 15:33.083
Oh, he's terrific.

15:33.083 --> 15:36.208
Really?
You're happy?

15:36.208 --> 15:38.583
Happy isn't even the word.

15:38.583 --> 15:41.625
Oh, that's what
I wanted to hear.

15:46.041 --> 15:48.000
My God.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.917
Did you see that look
she just gave you?

15:50.917 --> 15:51.875
What look?

15:51.875 --> 15:53.041
Seriously?

15:53.041 --> 15:55.250
I'm surprised
it didn't leave a mark.

15:55.250 --> 15:57.458
This is still that insanity
about you and Carol.

15:57.458 --> 15:59.458
Okay, there's something
I need to tell you.

15:59.458 --> 16:00.917
What?

16:00.917 --> 16:03.291
And FYI, I will be forced
to remind you

16:03.291 --> 16:04.875
of all the times
you didn't listen to me.

16:04.875 --> 16:07.875
Oh, shit.

16:07.875 --> 16:10.458
I was on a hike with Carol
this morning.

16:10.458 --> 16:11.959
Bloody hell,
I told you not--

16:11.959 --> 16:14.125
This would be the moment where
I remind you of all of the--

16:14.125 --> 16:16.625
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:16.625 --> 16:20.417
We came around a bend
in the trail, and...

16:20.417 --> 16:22.375
No.

16:22.375 --> 16:23.917
She may as well have been
wearing a hockey mask

16:23.917 --> 16:25.792
and carrying a machete.

16:25.792 --> 16:27.458
Do we still have a show?

16:27.458 --> 16:28.500
Maybe you do?

16:28.500 --> 16:29.417
Jesus Christ.

16:29.417 --> 16:30.792
- Hi, kids.
- Oh, perfect.

16:30.792 --> 16:32.333
How was the rest
of your day?

16:32.333 --> 16:33.792
- Great.
- He knows.

16:33.792 --> 16:35.792
Oh.
It was a fucking nightmare.

16:35.792 --> 16:37.333
She hates me.

16:39.166 --> 16:41.125
Shit, she just saw us
with you.

16:41.125 --> 16:44.041
Get away.
Get away.

16:44.041 --> 16:45.375
Go.

16:50.834 --> 16:51.917
Hey.

16:51.917 --> 16:54.834
So, what is going on
with you and Helen?

16:54.834 --> 16:56.333
- What?
- "What"?

16:56.333 --> 16:59.333
It's like Frozen
without the songs.

16:59.333 --> 17:01.458
Don't tell me it's over.

17:01.458 --> 17:03.667
What's over?

17:06.792 --> 17:08.750
Oh, Christ.

17:08.750 --> 17:13.041
Okay, no offense,
but you stay here.

17:19.583 --> 17:20.542
So?

17:20.542 --> 17:22.125
I was right.

17:22.125 --> 17:24.458
It's a dark night
in girl town.

17:24.458 --> 17:26.291
- Jesus.
- Yep.

17:26.291 --> 17:28.750
Get ready for
a big, fat mess.

17:28.750 --> 17:29.875
[sighs]

17:29.875 --> 17:32.709
Speaking of which,
where's Myra?

17:32.709 --> 17:33.750
I haven't seen her.

17:33.750 --> 17:35.208
Huh.

17:35.208 --> 17:36.583
[groans]

17:36.583 --> 17:37.625
That's it.
Keep pushing.

17:37.625 --> 17:40.875
[prolonged groan]

17:53.875 --> 17:54.834
- Hey, Matt!
- Hey.

17:54.834 --> 17:56.041
- Matt! Matt!
- Hey, how are ya?

17:56.041 --> 17:58.291
[cheers and applause]

17:58.291 --> 18:00.000
Hey, you made it.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.458
Don't you look sharp?

18:01.458 --> 18:03.208
Yeah?
You like the vest?

18:03.208 --> 18:05.166
- Very spiffy.
- It's terrific.

18:05.166 --> 18:07.917
Yeah, well, that asshole
won't let me wear it.

18:07.917 --> 18:09.417
What do you mean,
let you?

18:09.417 --> 18:11.750
It's your show, too.

18:11.750 --> 18:12.834
Hmm.

18:12.834 --> 18:14.583
What are you doing?

18:14.583 --> 18:16.041
Well, it is.

18:16.041 --> 18:18.709
You're just stirring shit
all over the place today.

18:18.709 --> 18:21.417
We're starting in two, everyone.
Starting in two.

18:21.417 --> 18:23.208
Matt, I need you
backstage.

18:23.208 --> 18:24.208
Perfect.

18:24.208 --> 18:25.000
Here we go.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.750
- Have fun.
- Don't suck.

18:26.750 --> 18:28.000
All right!

18:28.000 --> 18:30.583
Ha-ha, you look like
a terrific audience!

18:30.583 --> 18:32.917
Have a good show, huh?

18:32.917 --> 18:35.542
[cheers and applause]

18:35.542 --> 18:37.750
More, more, you guys!
What do you say?

18:37.750 --> 18:40.041
[cheers and applause]

18:40.041 --> 18:42.083
I'm sorry, Miss Rance.

18:42.083 --> 18:43.709
You can't stand here.

18:43.709 --> 18:47.542
Oh, sorry.

18:47.542 --> 18:48.667
Better?

18:48.667 --> 18:49.959
Uh, no.

18:49.959 --> 18:52.458
You can't stand anywhere.

18:52.458 --> 18:55.166
Mrs. Basch would like you
off the stage.

19:02.166 --> 19:05.291
No problem.
That's fine.

19:08.417 --> 19:11.417
[cheers and applause]

19:14.917 --> 19:17.625
Okay.

19:17.625 --> 19:19.291
[laughter]

19:19.291 --> 19:20.625
[exhales]

19:20.625 --> 19:22.083
Hi, it's me.

19:22.083 --> 19:24.125
[applause]

19:24.125 --> 19:26.333
Yeah, uh...

19:26.333 --> 19:28.583
If it's still available,

19:28.583 --> 19:31.208
I'll take the job.

19:31.208 --> 19:34.834
(man)
Okay, okay, okay.
Is everybody ready?

19:34.834 --> 19:37.166
Here we go, people.

19:37.166 --> 19:41.542
In five, four, three...

19:41.542 --> 19:42.834
Go camera one.

19:42.834 --> 19:44.125
(male announcer)
Seven people.

19:44.125 --> 19:46.000
[dramatic music]

19:46.000 --> 19:49.542
17 weeks.

19:49.542 --> 19:52.834
Only one will beat

19:52.834 --> 19:54.125
The Box!

19:54.125 --> 19:57.041
[energetic music]

19:57.041 --> 19:59.375
â™ª â™ª

19:59.375 --> 20:00.959
[coughs]

20:00.959 --> 20:02.125
Camera two.

20:02.125 --> 20:04.166
Matt, go four.
On its mark.

20:04.166 --> 20:06.208
I'm trying to quit.
I really am.

20:06.208 --> 20:07.125
Roll one.

20:07.125 --> 20:08.500
(Matt)
Welcome to The Box.

20:08.500 --> 20:10.166
Camera one, go.

20:10.166 --> 20:11.375
â™ª â™ª

20:11.375 --> 20:12.709
(woman)
How you doing?

20:12.709 --> 20:13.792
[laughter]

20:13.792 --> 20:15.959
(Matt)
Ah, glad we got that
out of the way.

20:15.959 --> 20:17.166
[laughter]

20:17.166 --> 20:18.792
- Camera one, standby.
- Yup.

20:18.792 --> 20:20.583
Going to camera one.

20:21.834 --> 20:23.875
- Hey, Eric.
- Hey.

20:23.875 --> 20:24.750
Little chilly in there?

20:24.750 --> 20:26.208
- A little bit.
- I bet.

20:26.208 --> 20:29.166
So, okay,
you've got 17 advantages,

20:29.166 --> 20:30.959
more than anyone else
so far.

20:30.959 --> 20:32.875
You can use them
to buy something for yourself

20:32.875 --> 20:35.208
like Mike and Kelly did.

20:35.208 --> 20:37.333
Let's see what's left
on the board.

20:37.333 --> 20:39.792
Somehow I'm thinking
you don't need a umbrella

20:39.792 --> 20:41.667
or a mystery novel.

20:41.667 --> 20:43.375
But a coat, ooh.

20:43.375 --> 20:46.542
How's a nice, comfy,
down coat sound right now?

20:46.542 --> 20:47.542
It sounds really good.

20:47.542 --> 20:48.792
[laughter]

20:48.792 --> 20:50.792
Or you can use
your advantages

20:50.792 --> 20:53.375
to disadvantage one
of your fellow contestants.

20:53.375 --> 20:56.375
Maybe get back at Claire?
Just saying.

20:56.375 --> 20:59.083
You can make someone's box
ten degrees hotter.

20:59.083 --> 21:01.583
We've still got feathers,

21:01.583 --> 21:03.792
stinky cheese,

21:03.792 --> 21:06.333
Gilbert Gottfried.

21:06.333 --> 21:10.750
And with 17 advantages,
just enough to release the bugs.

21:10.750 --> 21:12.125
What's it gonna be?

21:12.125 --> 21:16.250
(audience)
Release the bugs!
Release the bugs!

21:16.250 --> 21:17.959
Release the bugs!
Release the bugs!

21:17.959 --> 21:19.709
Go for the bugs.
Go for the bugs.

21:19.709 --> 21:20.917
Someone make sure
Gilbert's ready.

21:20.917 --> 21:22.083
You got it.

21:25.917 --> 21:27.083
Matt,

21:27.083 --> 21:31.917
I would like to spend
all of my advantages

21:31.917 --> 21:33.667
to release the bugs
on Claire.

21:33.667 --> 21:36.375
[cheers and applause]

21:36.375 --> 21:38.667
Wow.
Okay.

21:38.667 --> 21:40.875
[cheers and applause]

21:40.875 --> 21:42.458
Hey, Pete, love the tux.

21:42.458 --> 21:43.458
[laughter]

21:43.458 --> 21:45.041
Hi, Claire.

21:45.041 --> 21:46.417
Hi.

21:46.417 --> 21:49.834
This is what happens
when you take a guy's pants.

21:49.834 --> 21:51.959
So Eric went for the bugs.

21:51.959 --> 21:53.125
You like bugs?

21:53.125 --> 21:54.125
I really don't.

21:54.125 --> 21:55.291
I can't wait to meet
the person

21:55.291 --> 21:57.208
who says, "Yeah"
to that question.

21:57.208 --> 21:58.959
[laughter]

21:58.959 --> 22:00.959
So, you have a choice.

22:00.959 --> 22:05.083
You can become roommates with
a bunch of creepy-crawly guys,

22:05.083 --> 22:07.959
or you can ask me to open
your box and forfeit the game.

22:07.959 --> 22:09.041
(all)
Aww!

22:09.041 --> 22:10.000
What's it gonna be?

22:10.000 --> 22:13.250
[audience yelling]

22:15.834 --> 22:18.500
Go for the bugs.
Go for the fucking bugs.

22:18.500 --> 22:20.709
Five seconds.

22:22.417 --> 22:24.667
I-I can't. I can't.
I can't do it.

22:24.667 --> 22:26.667
I really hate bugs.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.542
Please open my box.

22:30.542 --> 22:31.500
[audience groans]

22:31.500 --> 22:32.834
Are you sure?
You know what this means.

22:32.834 --> 22:36.041
[audience boos]

22:37.083 --> 22:40.875
Oh.
No, I...I'm sure.

22:40.875 --> 22:42.000
Open my box.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.458
[crowd jeers]

22:44.458 --> 22:46.291
Okay.

22:46.291 --> 22:48.208
(female voice over PA)
Opening the box.

22:48.208 --> 22:50.291
[cheers and applause]

22:50.291 --> 22:52.041
Something tells me
the other six

22:52.041 --> 22:54.417
aren't gonna give up so easily,
but maybe I'm wrong.

22:54.417 --> 22:56.834
We'll find out
right after this.

22:56.834 --> 22:59.917
[cheers and applause]

23:01.709 --> 23:05.291
And we've cut.
We're back in five, everyone.

23:05.291 --> 23:06.834
We're gonna change
that line, right?

23:06.834 --> 23:09.333
She can't really ask me
to open her box.

23:09.333 --> 23:10.667
[laughter]

23:10.667 --> 23:13.250
[laughs]

23:13.250 --> 23:15.375
Can we keep this audience
every night?

23:15.375 --> 23:16.250
[cheers and applause]

23:16.250 --> 23:20.000
Yeah!
How amazing is Matt LeBlanc?

23:20.000 --> 23:23.875
[cheers and applause]

23:23.875 --> 23:27.000
So, I thought I told you
to lose the fucking vest.

23:28.750 --> 23:29.542
I like it.

23:29.542 --> 23:30.625
Yeah, well,
when this is done,

23:30.625 --> 23:32.834
we got to set
some fucking ground rules.

23:32.834 --> 23:34.000
Definitely,

23:34.000 --> 23:36.041
'cause somehow, you got the idea
that I work for you.

23:36.041 --> 23:38.291
Yeah, and what idea
do you have?

23:38.291 --> 23:39.291
Look around.

23:39.291 --> 23:41.625
Are you the show,
or am I the show?

23:41.625 --> 23:44.000
If they got rid of you,
who gives a shit?

23:44.000 --> 23:45.291
There's 100 of you.

23:45.291 --> 23:48.917
They'll just open up another box
of short, fat producers.

23:48.917 --> 23:50.250
[laughs]

23:50.250 --> 23:52.917
All right, you and I
need to have a little talk.

23:52.917 --> 23:54.542
- [laughs]
- Fine.

23:57.208 --> 23:59.500
You don't think
you're replaceable?

23:59.500 --> 24:00.500
Wake up.

24:00.500 --> 24:02.166
This isn't ten years ago.

24:02.166 --> 24:03.625
You're a guy who used to be.

24:03.625 --> 24:04.625
You're a rerun.

24:04.625 --> 24:07.000
You're hosting
a fucking game show.

24:07.000 --> 24:10.083
Look up, way up there.
You know what that is?

24:10.083 --> 24:12.250
That's the top of the barrel.

24:12.250 --> 24:15.750
Listen, you big bag
of assholes,

24:15.750 --> 24:17.125
you don't tell me what to do.

24:17.125 --> 24:19.709
[inaudible conversation]

24:22.125 --> 24:23.125
- Really?
- Really.

24:23.125 --> 24:24.125
- Really?
- Really.

24:24.125 --> 24:25.750
You bring nothing
to this.

24:25.750 --> 24:27.125
Fuck you.

24:27.125 --> 24:28.625
All right, you know what?
If we're gonna do

24:28.625 --> 24:30.083
this piece of crap,
I don't want to see your face.

24:30.083 --> 24:31.208
- Oh, really?
- Really.

24:31.208 --> 24:32.291
- Really?
- Really.

24:32.291 --> 24:33.709
- Really?
- You don't talk to me.

24:33.709 --> 24:36.083
You don't look at me.
You can take your hugs

24:36.083 --> 24:39.792
and your annoying laugh
and your teeny-tiny dick--

24:39.792 --> 24:41.792
Oh, yeah, Jamie told me.

24:41.792 --> 24:44.333
You'd think having only one ball
would make it look bigger,

24:44.333 --> 24:45.625
but apparently, not so much.

24:45.625 --> 24:47.458
- Fuck you.
- No, fuck you!

24:47.458 --> 24:51.083
You know what?
Actually, I already fucked you.

24:51.083 --> 24:52.542
You know your NBC pilot?

24:52.542 --> 24:54.583
Who do you think
told Elliot Salad about it?

24:54.583 --> 24:55.542
- What?
- Yeah.

24:55.542 --> 24:57.458
Why do you think
they picked up Pucks!?

24:57.458 --> 25:02.125
Oh, yeah, that's my tiny dick
in your ass, my friend.

25:02.125 --> 25:03.709
You son of a bitch.

25:03.709 --> 25:04.834
Aah!

25:04.834 --> 25:07.333
[audience murmuring]

25:07.333 --> 25:10.166
Somehow I feel like
we've seen this show before.

25:10.166 --> 25:11.959
- [grunts]
- You like that?

25:11.959 --> 25:13.333
Aah!
Oh.

25:13.333 --> 25:16.208
[audience murmuring]

25:18.667 --> 25:20.000
- You like that?
- [grunts]

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
(all)
Matt! Matt! Matt!

25:22.000 --> 25:24.500
- Damn it, the balls!
- You've got two!

25:24.500 --> 25:29.208
(all)
Matt! Matt! Matt! Matt! Matt!

25:29.208 --> 25:31.709
Get your stupid hands
off of me!

25:31.709 --> 25:34.959
(all)
Matt!
Oh!

25:34.959 --> 25:36.792
(female voice over PA)
Securing the box.

25:36.792 --> 25:38.041
No, no, no!

25:38.041 --> 25:39.500
(man)
Yeah!

25:41.750 --> 25:43.000
Release the bugs!

25:43.000 --> 25:46.625
[cheers and applause]

25:46.625 --> 25:49.208
(all)
Release the bugs!
Release the bugs!

25:49.208 --> 25:51.333
Release the bugs!
Release the bugs!

25:51.333 --> 25:54.709
Release the bugs!
Release the bugs!

25:55.542 --> 25:56.583
No!

25:56.583 --> 25:58.709
(audience)
Release the bugs!
Release the bugs!

25:58.709 --> 26:00.333
(female voice over PA)
Releasing the bugs.

26:00.333 --> 26:01.375
[buzzing]

26:01.375 --> 26:02.959
No!

26:02.959 --> 26:06.000
[prolonged scream]

26:10.709 --> 26:11.834
[dings]

26:13.583 --> 26:15.792
You know, it might not be
what you're thinking.

26:15.792 --> 26:17.375
Oh, absolutely.

26:17.375 --> 26:19.291
I'm sure they called us in
to give us each a pony.

26:19.291 --> 26:21.166
Why would she kill the show
in person?

26:21.166 --> 26:22.583
It's something they do
over the phone.

26:22.583 --> 26:24.709
Not if she wants to see
the look on your face.

26:24.709 --> 26:27.583
Maybe Carol knows
something.

26:30.375 --> 26:32.375
This is her office,
isn't it?

26:32.375 --> 26:35.542
I think so?

26:35.542 --> 26:37.750
She's gone.

26:39.583 --> 26:42.375
(receptionist)
Good morning, the CW.

26:45.750 --> 26:47.250
Ugh.
[laughs]

26:47.250 --> 26:50.917
Hi, I'm Carol Rance.
I'm starting today.

26:50.917 --> 26:52.500
Oh, hi.

26:52.500 --> 26:55.333
Can you please let
Castor Sotto know I'm here?

26:55.333 --> 26:57.375
Uh...

26:57.375 --> 27:00.125
I have an Esther de Vito.

27:00.125 --> 27:02.250
No, no.

27:02.250 --> 27:04.375
Castor Sotto.

27:05.709 --> 27:06.750
It's not official yet,

27:06.750 --> 27:09.625
but he's the new
head of the network.

27:10.709 --> 27:12.125
Hang on.

27:13.959 --> 27:16.709
Hi.
There's a woman here.

27:16.709 --> 27:18.458
- Carol Rance.
- Carol Rance.

27:18.458 --> 27:20.125
She's looking
for Carter--

27:20.125 --> 27:22.583
- Castor.
- Castor Sotto.

27:22.583 --> 27:24.917
She says he's the new
head of the network.

27:26.583 --> 27:29.458
Uh-huh.

27:29.458 --> 27:30.417
Mm-kay.

27:30.417 --> 27:33.458
Yeah, that's
what I thought.

27:33.458 --> 27:36.917
Yeah, there's
no Castor Sotto here.

27:36.917 --> 27:41.834
No one knows who he is
or what you're talking about.

27:41.834 --> 27:45.000
[laughs]
Well, that's insane.

27:49.417 --> 27:52.000
I am not a very
forgiving woman,

27:52.000 --> 27:55.709
and I don't appreciate
being made a fool of.

27:55.709 --> 27:58.250
I'm sorry, may I just say,
there's never been anything

27:58.250 --> 27:59.250
between my wife--

27:59.250 --> 28:00.291
Oh, honey, please.

28:00.291 --> 28:01.625
If it walks like a duck

28:01.625 --> 28:02.750
and it quacks like a duck,

28:02.750 --> 28:07.750
it's fucking my ex-girlfriend
like a duck.

28:07.750 --> 28:10.500
But you know what?

28:10.500 --> 28:13.625
First and foremost,
I am a professional,

28:13.625 --> 28:16.542
and your show is important
to this network,

28:16.542 --> 28:19.291
so I'm not going to let
my personal issues

28:19.291 --> 28:20.500
get in the way of that.

28:20.500 --> 28:24.709
For which we are
very, very appreciative.

28:27.083 --> 28:28.834
Very.

28:28.834 --> 28:32.709
That said, there's one small
change that I'd like to make.

28:32.709 --> 28:34.375
I'm so sorry I'm late.

28:34.375 --> 28:36.583
It's exciting, isn't it?

28:36.583 --> 28:38.750
Oh, I was just
about to tell them.

28:38.750 --> 28:43.500
I think it's best
if Tim runs the show.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.917
Oh, no.

28:59.291 --> 29:02.208
Oh.

29:02.208 --> 29:05.458
(baby)
Oh.

29:05.458 --> 29:07.875
Mmm.

29:07.875 --> 29:09.917
(baby)
Mmm.

29:11.083 --> 29:13.917
Mmm.

29:13.917 --> 29:15.875
(baby)
Mmm.
