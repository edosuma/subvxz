WEBVTT

00:01.601 --> 00:03.371
You want to be with Shelby,
screw it, be with Shelby.

00:03.404 --> 00:04.505
I don't know
what your game is,

00:04.538 --> 00:05.506
but I am going to
have you out of here

00:05.539 --> 00:06.740
within a week.

00:06.774 --> 00:08.776
I've never had a real
relationship, Wade.
Me neither.

00:08.809 --> 00:10.578
Sometimes you just
got to wing it.

00:10.611 --> 00:12.213
We're gonna drive
each other crazy sometimes.

00:12.246 --> 00:13.581
But you got to remember,

00:13.614 --> 00:15.749
that's what brought us
together in the first place.

00:15.783 --> 00:17.351
You know, sometimes
I think about the time

00:17.385 --> 00:18.519
we had together.

00:18.552 --> 00:19.687
We were in love once,

00:19.720 --> 00:22.056
and, Lord help me,
I still think I am.

00:22.090 --> 00:23.157
ANNABETH:
 Forget about Lavon;
 you've got Walt.

00:23.191 --> 00:24.158
Mayor Hayes and I are friends,

00:24.192 --> 00:27.128
but we both belonged
elsewhere.
Glad to hear it.

00:27.161 --> 00:28.462
AnnaBeth, Mayor Hayes
is totally into you.

00:28.496 --> 00:30.398
It doesn't matter-- there
is no world in which

00:30.431 --> 00:32.800
I could pursue a relationship
with the man Lemon once loved.

00:40.208 --> 00:42.410
(whistling)

00:42.443 --> 00:44.578
Well, well, well,

00:44.612 --> 00:46.447
look what the cat dragged in.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.182
You've pulled three
all-nighters in a row.

00:48.216 --> 00:50.218
You must be beat.

00:50.251 --> 00:52.453
(kisses)
I know. Except I'm not.

00:52.486 --> 00:54.422
You know, ever since
I helped this town

00:54.455 --> 00:57.158
through the flu, the people
are, like, trusting me

00:57.191 --> 00:59.260
with their most intimate
secrets;

00:59.293 --> 01:00.728
sharing their deepest fears.

01:00.761 --> 01:02.563
They appreciate me.

01:02.596 --> 01:03.697
Well, let's not forget

01:03.731 --> 01:05.498
who appreciated you
first, all right?

01:05.533 --> 01:07.535
And, for the record,
I'm getting a little tired

01:07.568 --> 01:10.171
of having to appreciate
you by myself.

01:10.204 --> 01:11.439
If you catch my drift.

01:11.472 --> 01:13.107
Oh, you mean,
like, in a sex way.

01:13.141 --> 01:14.542
Bingo.
Clever.

01:14.575 --> 01:15.543
Well, I'm only
thinking of others.

01:15.576 --> 01:19.113
You know, when the, uh,
(clears throat) men

01:19.147 --> 01:20.848
in a society
don't get enough sex,

01:20.881 --> 01:24.418
they can become a mean
and war-like people.

01:24.452 --> 01:27.121
You know, I do hate war.

01:27.155 --> 01:28.622
So, tonight,
I'm all yours.
Mm.

01:31.325 --> 01:32.660
ZOE:
 I'm popular.

01:32.693 --> 01:34.128
I'm finally fitting in.

01:34.162 --> 01:36.264
This morning
Babs Foster came by,

01:36.297 --> 01:38.432
gave me a casserole gonna
last me through next winter.

01:38.466 --> 01:41.202
Yesterday, I got a free
manicure at Mane Street.

01:41.235 --> 01:42.603
Then, a ten-minute massage
with one of those

01:42.636 --> 01:44.172
new machines
they put behind your head.

01:44.205 --> 01:45.339
Oh, that's not a machine.

01:45.373 --> 01:46.774
Billy Barnes
likes to sneak in,

01:46.807 --> 01:48.476
and rub lady's necks
when their eyes are closed.

01:48.509 --> 01:50.344
I'm not going
to think about that

01:50.378 --> 01:51.879
because people love me.

01:51.912 --> 01:53.147
(quietly):
Yeah.

01:53.181 --> 01:54.282
What are you
looking for?

01:54.315 --> 01:56.217
What? Uh, nothing,
no one, nobody.

01:56.250 --> 01:59.487
Lavon Hayes,
you're looking for a girl.

02:00.454 --> 02:01.489
Come on, spill the beans.

02:01.522 --> 02:02.890
Can't.

02:02.923 --> 02:05.226
I don't even know
if it's a thing yet.

02:05.259 --> 02:06.627
She's acting kind
of weird about it.

02:06.660 --> 02:09.163
All right, fine,
one bean.

02:09.197 --> 02:10.898
Who is it?
I can keep a secret.

02:10.931 --> 02:13.201
Uh, debatable.

02:13.234 --> 02:14.768
But as soon as I know
this thing's a thing,

02:14.802 --> 02:16.504
I'll tell you.

02:16.537 --> 02:18.206
I-I'll see you
later. Go on.

02:18.239 --> 02:19.240
Go about your
business.

02:19.273 --> 02:20.808
(blows raspberries)

02:21.942 --> 02:24.345
(awkward chuckle)
Hey, A.B.

02:24.378 --> 02:25.779
I was hoping I'd see you.

02:25.813 --> 02:27.615
I can't stop thinking
about the other night.

02:27.648 --> 02:30.318
It was so amazing.

02:30.351 --> 02:33.254
It was, right?

02:33.287 --> 02:37.391
I mean, you did make
amazed sort of sounds.

02:37.425 --> 02:39.660
Oh, yes, I was amazed.

02:39.693 --> 02:40.661
(chuckles nervously)

02:40.694 --> 02:43.631
Um, it's just, I...

02:43.664 --> 02:45.833
It's just what?

02:45.866 --> 02:48.202
Complicated.
I've got to scoot.

02:51.905 --> 02:53.507
A bottle of wine, Frank?

02:53.541 --> 02:54.775
Pinot?

02:54.808 --> 02:56.877
I got that special
for you, Doc.
Aw.

02:56.910 --> 02:59.280
You got my wife
through the flu

02:59.313 --> 03:02.550
and that woman is a real
B-word when she's sick,

03:02.583 --> 03:03.684
you know what I mean?

03:03.717 --> 03:04.685
I think I do.

03:04.718 --> 03:05.919
Rhymes with
"doll buster."

03:05.953 --> 03:06.920
Nope, I was wrong.

03:06.954 --> 03:08.222
Frank-a-lank!

03:08.256 --> 03:09.390
Hey.

03:09.423 --> 03:10.758
Can I grab a bottle
of that red?

03:10.791 --> 03:13.394
Well, slap me silly,
you're back.

03:13.427 --> 03:15.429
Here you go.
What the hell, Frank?

03:15.463 --> 03:17.865
Well, sorry, but
I only got the one

03:17.898 --> 03:20.568
and I've known Jonah
since he was a baby.

03:20.601 --> 03:22.836
Hey, I don't mean
to ruffle your...

03:22.870 --> 03:23.804
very attractive feathers,

03:23.837 --> 03:26.240
it's just that I wanted
this to celebrate.

03:26.274 --> 03:27.441
Oh, yeah,
what are you celebrating?

03:27.475 --> 03:28.642
You having dinner
with me tonight.

03:28.676 --> 03:29.843
(laughs):
Ho-ho...

03:29.877 --> 03:30.978
You did not just...

03:31.011 --> 03:32.780
Say that?
I just really did.

03:32.813 --> 03:35.316
Come on, why not share
your wine with a friend?

03:35.349 --> 03:37.318
I already have a friend.
Thank you.

03:37.351 --> 03:39.387
Kind of surprising,
but okay.

03:39.420 --> 03:40.921
(scoffs)

03:44.057 --> 03:45.493
I think she likes me.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.496
BRICK (stammers):
 Wh-what do you mean

03:48.529 --> 03:49.863
you're here
to see Dr. Hart?

03:49.897 --> 03:52.466
Esther, I've been your
doctor for 20 years.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.502
Now...
Actually, it's-it's
a follow-up.

03:54.535 --> 03:55.969
She's sprained her wrist
while you were gone.

03:56.003 --> 03:57.738
Hey, Esther,
why don't you go on in?

03:57.771 --> 03:59.507
Thank you.

04:02.009 --> 04:05.479
That is the third patient
today who has requested you.

04:05.513 --> 04:06.647
How much you paying them?

04:06.680 --> 04:08.015
What can I say?

04:08.048 --> 04:10.050
BlueBell and I kind of became
besties during the flu.

04:10.083 --> 04:13.654
Can you make sure
everyone gets one of these?

04:13.687 --> 04:15.656
Thanks.

04:20.528 --> 04:22.496
Oh, good Lord,
here she comes.

04:22.530 --> 04:23.897
Lemon. Hello.

04:23.931 --> 04:26.300
I knew I'd
find you here.

04:26.334 --> 04:28.536
San Antonio was fantastic,
thank you for asking.

04:28.569 --> 04:29.703
I have to show you our pics.

04:29.737 --> 04:30.804
Look, Alamo...
Mm-hmm.

04:30.838 --> 04:32.540
Alamo...
Mm.

04:32.573 --> 04:33.541
Alamo...
Mm-hmm.

04:33.574 --> 04:34.942
But why am I rambling

04:34.975 --> 04:36.844
when we have important items
to discuss?

04:36.877 --> 04:38.646
Oh, we do?

04:38.679 --> 04:40.748
It's Brick's birthday
this weekend,

04:40.781 --> 04:42.383
and he wants to have a party
where he would like

04:42.416 --> 04:43.917
to introduce a special
someone to his friends.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.986
So, everything has
got to be perfect.

04:46.019 --> 04:47.120
I started jotting
down ideas

04:47.154 --> 04:50.023
and I just had so many, I had to
buy a second notebook.

04:50.057 --> 04:51.525
Ideas.

04:51.559 --> 04:53.727
You have ideas
about my father's birthday.

04:53.761 --> 04:56.964
Yeah... and I am sure she
cannot wait to hear them.

04:56.997 --> 04:59.500
I'll call you. I'm-I'm
sorry to interrupt.

05:00.568 --> 05:02.035
Magnolia,

05:02.069 --> 05:03.737
that is such a
cute dress.

05:03.771 --> 05:04.938
It really makes
your eyes pop.

05:04.972 --> 05:05.873
(feigns laughter)

05:07.708 --> 05:09.943
God, and her voice
really makes my ears bleed.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.412
I swear, if Daddy marries her,

05:11.445 --> 05:13.481
I am not splitting his will
three ways.

05:13.514 --> 05:14.615
You can share your half.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.417
Well, fortunately,
that won't be an issue.

05:16.450 --> 05:18.419
Daddy's going though
a mid-life crisis,

05:18.452 --> 05:19.953
but Shelby won't
be around for long.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.054
I can promise you that.

05:21.088 --> 05:25.593
Yes! I knew you would come up
with some evil plan.

05:25.626 --> 05:27.027
I'm the luckiest sister
in the whole world.

05:27.060 --> 05:29.397
I don't know, y'all. (giggle)

05:29.430 --> 05:31.565
Brick does
seem really happy,

05:31.599 --> 05:34.935
and the heart wants what
the heart wants, right?

05:34.968 --> 05:35.936
AnnaBeth, we're not animals.

05:35.969 --> 05:38.572
We can control who we do
and do not sleep with.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.442
Right. You're so right.

05:41.475 --> 05:43.444
As always.
Oh, my God, they've had sex?

05:43.477 --> 05:44.612
You know, you might want
to cut back on the caffeine.

05:44.645 --> 05:46.113
You're making a little
less sense than usual.

05:46.146 --> 05:47.381
It might explain
that break out, too.

05:52.085 --> 05:53.454
Wade, I'm on my way.

05:53.487 --> 05:55.589
Keep dinner warm,
and keep you warm, too.

05:55.623 --> 05:56.990
Oh, my God,
please erase that.

05:57.024 --> 05:59.660
Zoe, Zoe, hi, I-I need
to see you right away.

05:59.693 --> 06:00.994
Ah-ah-ah-ah,
now young lady,

06:01.028 --> 06:02.663
I delivered you
into this world,

06:02.696 --> 06:04.732
I forbid you
from seeing Dr. Hart.

06:04.765 --> 06:08.702
I'm sorry Dr. Breeland,
it's a woman thing.

06:10.471 --> 06:11.872
(sighs)

06:11.905 --> 06:13.841
It's VD, isn't it?

06:13.874 --> 06:16.544
God is smiting me
with VD for my sins.

06:16.577 --> 06:18.746
Well, if he is,
he's doing it in World War II,

06:18.779 --> 06:20.714
because nobody
says "VD" anymore.

06:20.748 --> 06:22.115
It's actually
just a pimple.

06:22.149 --> 06:23.684
Well, I deserve VD.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.152
Do you want
to talk about it?

06:25.185 --> 06:27.521
I slept with the last person
on Earth I should have.

06:27.555 --> 06:29.189
I'm a terrible person.

06:29.222 --> 06:31.091
Who? I can keep a secret.

06:32.159 --> 06:34.495
Why does everyone
keep reacting like that?

06:34.528 --> 06:36.497
You know, Lavon did
the same thing... to me.

06:37.898 --> 06:40.868
Oh, my God.

06:40.901 --> 06:41.869
Oh, my God,
what were you thinking?

06:41.902 --> 06:45.673
Yeah, I know. That's why
I deserve to be smote.

06:45.706 --> 06:47.074
Smited? Smitten?

06:47.107 --> 06:49.777
I... I just hope my
hair doesn't fall out.

06:49.810 --> 06:51.011
It is my best feature.

06:51.044 --> 06:53.013
Well, was it a one-time thing,
or do you have feelings for him?

06:53.046 --> 06:54.114
You know him.

06:54.147 --> 06:56.817
How could I not have
feelings for him?

06:56.850 --> 06:58.952
Oh, Lemon's
going to be so hurt.

06:58.986 --> 07:01.121
And then,
of course, destroy me.

07:01.154 --> 07:02.856
Well, this is
a small town

07:02.890 --> 07:05.125
so you are going to have
to be the one to tell her

07:05.158 --> 07:06.894
if you want to save
your friendship.

07:06.927 --> 07:10.197
You're right.

07:10.230 --> 07:12.866
Will you role play
some various scenarios with me?

07:12.900 --> 07:15.035
If I don't prepare,

07:15.068 --> 07:17.771
I'll chicken out.
Now?

07:17.805 --> 07:20.474
If-if you have somewhere
to be, it's fine.

07:20.508 --> 07:22.710
No, no, you need me.

07:22.743 --> 07:24.712
Wade will understand.
Just let me text him, okay?

07:35.055 --> 07:36.990
ZOE:
Wade?

07:41.228 --> 07:43.631
(snoring quietly)

07:51.739 --> 07:53.473
(sighs)

08:09.222 --> 08:10.958
Hey, Wade, hey,
can I talk to you for a sec?

08:10.991 --> 08:12.593
Well, well,

08:12.626 --> 08:14.161
have you come to take
my orange juice, too?

08:14.194 --> 08:15.563
It was my wine.

08:15.596 --> 08:17.565
So, I take it you
two have met?

08:17.598 --> 08:18.832
Not officially.

08:18.866 --> 08:20.000
Jonah Breeland.

08:20.033 --> 08:21.602
Breeland.
Mm-hmm.

08:21.635 --> 08:22.870
There's more of them.

08:22.903 --> 08:24.605
Yeah, this is Brick's nephew.

08:24.638 --> 08:27.741
Uh, Jonah, this is Zoe Hart,
beloved town doctor.

08:27.775 --> 08:30.844
And this is who
I shared my wine with.

08:30.878 --> 08:31.879
Wine, when?

08:31.912 --> 08:33.179
Well, I meant to.

08:33.212 --> 08:35.148
Excuse me, while I
grab him for a second.

08:35.182 --> 08:36.784
Well...

08:39.953 --> 08:41.922
I am so, so sorry
about last night.

08:41.955 --> 08:44.124
I had no idea you had
all that planned.

08:44.157 --> 08:45.926
Is there any way
I can make it up to you?

08:45.959 --> 08:46.994
Sex.

08:47.027 --> 08:49.630
Yeah, I know.
But something more?

08:49.663 --> 08:51.632
More sex.

08:51.665 --> 08:53.767
Look, my buddy Bo said we can
borrow his hunting cabin.

08:53.801 --> 08:55.803
Why don't you and I
get away for a weekend?

08:55.836 --> 08:57.270
(sighs)
The weekend?

08:57.304 --> 08:59.873
It sounds great,
but you know it's a bad time.

08:59.907 --> 09:01.942
I have all these patients
recovering...

09:01.975 --> 09:03.911
Yeah, they're recovering from
the flu, not Ebola, all right?

09:03.944 --> 09:05.779
They're going to be here
when you get back.

09:05.813 --> 09:07.648
Come on.

09:07.681 --> 09:09.783
Brick does owe me.

09:09.817 --> 09:12.285
All right! 48 hours of F-U...

09:12.319 --> 09:14.121
Wade!

09:14.154 --> 09:16.189
Come on, I was just
going to spell "fun."

09:16.223 --> 09:18.626
It's like all you
can think about is sex.

09:19.827 --> 09:21.328
Okay, so, Magnolia
and I will be

09:21.361 --> 09:22.630
helping Shelby plan
your birthday party.

09:22.663 --> 09:23.797
Oh.

09:23.831 --> 09:25.599
Because she hardly
knows you, of course.

09:25.633 --> 09:26.634
Oh, no, she does.

09:26.667 --> 09:28.936
Either she has the most
penetrating understanding

09:28.969 --> 09:31.204
of human nature,
or I'm just shallow as hell,

09:31.238 --> 09:33.006
but either way, I'm good.

09:33.040 --> 09:37.277
Daddy, are you sure that you
two are ready to go public?

09:37.310 --> 09:41.815
Lemonade, as long as you
and Magnolia give her a chance,

09:41.849 --> 09:43.216
I don't care what
anyone else thinks.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.185
JONAH:
If you're waiting
for the bus,

09:45.218 --> 09:46.954
I think the last
one left in 1974.

09:46.987 --> 09:49.222
Oh, would you
look at you.
Jonah!

09:49.256 --> 09:50.658
What are you doing here?
(laughing)

09:50.691 --> 09:52.392
Well, I had a
few days off,

09:52.425 --> 09:54.361
I figured I'd come to my
favorite uncle's birthday.

09:54.394 --> 09:56.163
That sounds good.

09:56.196 --> 09:57.631
And, Lemon, my apologies
for missing your wedding.

09:57.665 --> 09:59.099
I wish I could've been
here to personally see

09:59.132 --> 10:01.134
the demonic terror
you unleashed on George Tucker.

10:01.168 --> 10:02.369
Well...

10:02.402 --> 10:04.838
Actually, Jonah,
in the face of that horrendous

10:04.872 --> 10:08.075
tragedy, Lemon responded
as the mature and selfless woman

10:08.108 --> 10:09.376
she has become.

10:09.409 --> 10:11.912
Oh, Daddy, stop.
I mean it.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.781
My girl is changing
for the better.

10:13.814 --> 10:15.883
Well, I'm-I'm trying.

10:15.916 --> 10:16.917
This is Lemon 2.0:

10:16.950 --> 10:18.986
selfless, generous...

10:19.019 --> 10:20.253
and I've never been more proud.

10:20.287 --> 10:21.388
Daddy, come on, stop.

10:21.421 --> 10:23.824
I'm sure that Jonah's sick of
hearing how great I am.

10:23.857 --> 10:25.025
A little bit, yeah.

10:25.058 --> 10:26.193
(laughing)

10:26.226 --> 10:27.961
You know,
I was sorry to hear about

10:27.995 --> 10:29.963
AnnaBeth's divorce.

10:29.997 --> 10:32.065
Well, not really.
Is she seeing anyone?

10:32.099 --> 10:34.001
(laughs)
Well...

10:34.034 --> 10:35.836
I mean, you two did
always have sparks.

10:35.869 --> 10:37.170
I'll check it
out for you.

10:37.204 --> 10:39.372
Oh, if y'all excuse me
for just a sec,

10:39.406 --> 10:42.843
I just need to say hi.
Huh. Yeah.

10:42.876 --> 10:45.178
Jonah is back.
Ugh.

10:45.212 --> 10:46.947
And you and Shelby
are working together.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.883
I just... this is shaping up
to be the best birthday ever.

10:49.917 --> 10:51.685
(laughs)

10:53.353 --> 10:55.889
Hey, Lemon, I love your hair.
Looks so nice.

10:55.923 --> 10:57.090
Funny thing happened:

10:57.124 --> 10:59.426
(laughs nervously)
I slept with the mayor.

10:59.459 --> 11:00.761
(phone rings)

11:00.794 --> 11:02.662
Oh.

11:03.731 --> 11:05.465
Uh...

11:05.498 --> 11:07.067
Hello.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.268
Oh, AnnaBeth.

11:08.301 --> 11:09.970
Uh, hey, it's Lavon.

11:10.003 --> 11:11.338
Um...

11:11.371 --> 11:14.174
Look, I feel like things
have been a little

11:14.207 --> 11:16.710
weird between us
ever since we...

11:16.744 --> 11:18.478
you know.

11:18.511 --> 11:20.814
And I was hoping
we could talk about it.

11:20.848 --> 11:22.415
Perhaps over dinner tonight?

11:22.449 --> 11:24.217
What do you say?
No.

11:25.152 --> 11:27.087
Yes. No.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.388
(stammers):
I-I...

11:28.421 --> 11:30.157
There is something
I have to do first.

11:30.190 --> 11:31.424
I will call you back.

11:32.492 --> 11:34.862
Yeah.

11:34.895 --> 11:38.198
Okay. Thank you.

11:38.231 --> 11:40.367
(sighs)

11:40.400 --> 11:41.769
(clears throat)

11:41.802 --> 11:44.938
So, listen, I have
to ask you something.

11:44.972 --> 11:45.939
Sure. Yeah,
just, could you get...

11:45.973 --> 11:48.108
could you get the dog
to stop chewing my shoe?

11:48.141 --> 11:50.110
Dolly, stop.

11:51.779 --> 11:54.347
You just have to be
firm, but gentle.
(forced chuckle)

11:54.381 --> 11:56.516
You love her, right?

11:56.549 --> 11:59.152
Do I-do I love her?

11:59.186 --> 12:01.288
I-I feel very
warmly for her

12:01.321 --> 12:03.390
when she's not licking my
face when I'm trying to sleep,

12:03.423 --> 12:05.292
or staring at us
while we're kissing,

12:05.325 --> 12:07.294
or eating my shoe.
(chuckles)

12:07.327 --> 12:08.829
Then would you please,
please, please

12:08.862 --> 12:10.964
consider doing me the
greatest favor in the world?

12:10.998 --> 12:14.267
Anything.

12:14.301 --> 12:16.436
I got a call to do
hair at the auto show

12:16.469 --> 12:18.171
in Birmingham and I
was hoping you could

12:18.205 --> 12:20.173
babysit Dolly
Parton tonight.

12:20.207 --> 12:21.942
Of... of course.

12:21.975 --> 12:24.211
Just tell me
what I need to do.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.846
Okay.
(awkward laugh)

12:25.879 --> 12:27.114
First things first:

12:27.147 --> 12:28.515
this is her favorite toy,
Sir Squeaks-a-Lot.

12:28.548 --> 12:30.818
Oh.
She needs long walks
in the morning;

12:30.851 --> 12:32.319
(squeaking)
45 minutes at
a fast pace.

12:32.352 --> 12:34.221
Meals are at exactly
8:30 and 5:00.

12:34.254 --> 12:37.524
Thunderstorms, baths, well,
any kind of water really,

12:37.557 --> 12:38.859
scares the bejeezus
out of her,

12:38.892 --> 12:40.093
and the only way
to calm her down

12:40.127 --> 12:42.129
is singing "Jolene."

12:42.162 --> 12:43.196
Dolly loves her Dolly.

12:43.230 --> 12:44.564
Yeah, I need to write
all this down,

12:44.597 --> 12:45.933
but could you...
could you get her

12:45.966 --> 12:47.100
to stop squeaking
the damn frog?

12:47.134 --> 12:49.302
(stammers): The damn...
the damn cute frog.

12:49.336 --> 12:51.038
That's... squeaky...
I like it.

12:52.205 --> 12:53.173
Thank you.

12:53.206 --> 12:55.008
Yeah, yeah.

12:55.042 --> 12:56.143
Give it, give it, give it.

12:56.176 --> 12:57.377
(squeaks)

12:57.410 --> 12:59.546
Oh...

12:59.579 --> 13:02.015
This is gonna be awesome.

13:02.049 --> 13:04.384
Oh, here is a good one.

13:04.417 --> 13:07.487
What if the theme
is "Gettin' Wiggy with It"

13:07.520 --> 13:08.989
and everybody's
got to wear wigs?

13:09.022 --> 13:10.257
Could you just die.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.893
Yes, I could,
right now.

13:12.926 --> 13:15.028
LEMON:
Um, all of these

13:15.062 --> 13:16.897
are very good...

13:16.930 --> 13:18.131
excellent ideas,

13:18.165 --> 13:20.834
so, why don't you just
pick your favorite,

13:20.868 --> 13:22.836
and we will do everything
that we can to help you out.

13:22.870 --> 13:25.072
Oh, yay.

13:26.974 --> 13:28.308
Oh, I feel like
I have two new sisters.

13:28.341 --> 13:29.376
Now I have to go shopping.

13:29.409 --> 13:31.845
Oh, I just get that tingly
feeling when I say that.

13:31.879 --> 13:33.480
Kiss, kiss.
(kissing)

13:35.382 --> 13:37.450
Okay, what is your plan
to get rid of her

13:37.484 --> 13:40.287
and how does it involve
throwing Daddy a wig party?

13:40.320 --> 13:43.857
I have evolved, Magnolia,

13:43.891 --> 13:45.458
and I'm trying to be
a better person.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.160
Are you going soft on me?

13:47.194 --> 13:49.196
Don't you go soft on me.

13:52.632 --> 13:54.034
What on Earth
was that about?

13:54.067 --> 13:57.070
Oh, she's not a big fan
of Lemon 2.0.

13:57.104 --> 13:59.239
(clears throat)

13:59.272 --> 14:00.507
What's up?

14:02.509 --> 14:04.011
How's Walt?

14:04.044 --> 14:06.980
He's great. Why?

14:08.115 --> 14:09.349
So, you two are good?

14:09.382 --> 14:10.350
Yeah.

14:10.383 --> 14:12.452
Good. Good.

14:12.485 --> 14:14.021
Yep.

14:14.054 --> 14:17.324
Whoo, it must be nice
to be over Lavon.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.960
(laughing)

14:19.993 --> 14:21.628
Why do you ask?

14:21.661 --> 14:23.530
No reason.

14:26.934 --> 14:29.269
Oh, my God,
you know what I almost forgot?

14:29.302 --> 14:31.404
Guess who's back in town
and who asked about you?

14:32.505 --> 14:34.574
Jonah.

14:34.607 --> 14:35.642
You don't say.

14:35.675 --> 14:37.010
You both are single,

14:37.044 --> 14:38.511
so why don't you go out
to dinner tonight?

14:38.545 --> 14:40.347
Oh, Lemon, I...

14:40.380 --> 14:41.514
You know what,
don't thank me.

14:41.548 --> 14:42.549
We're best friends.

14:42.582 --> 14:43.483
It's the least I can do.

14:43.516 --> 14:45.418
I'll give him a call
right now and set it up.

14:48.255 --> 14:49.389
ZOE:
Brick, I need this.

14:49.422 --> 14:51.024
I deserve this.

14:51.058 --> 14:53.260
Well, as much as I would
love to work this weekend,

14:53.293 --> 14:55.929
and remind everyone in
town who the real doctor is,

14:55.963 --> 14:58.999
it is my birthday and my girls
are throwing me a party.

14:59.032 --> 15:00.934
Oh, my invitation must've
got lost in the mail.

15:00.968 --> 15:01.834
Zoe's worked her butt off

15:01.868 --> 15:04.071
covering for you,
you stupid ol' ass.

15:04.104 --> 15:06.339
Oh, whoa, whoa, now, what was
it you just called me?

15:06.373 --> 15:08.475
Now, now, now
you two calm down.

15:08.508 --> 15:09.542
There's no need.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.044
We can settle this
without insults.

15:11.078 --> 15:12.179
Can't we just
flip a coin?

15:12.212 --> 15:16.183
No, I will not let my birthday
be decided by chance.

15:16.216 --> 15:17.985
SHERIFF BILL:
Well, how about a contest?

15:18.018 --> 15:21.121
Like, whoever can cure
the next patient

15:21.154 --> 15:22.655
who walks
through that door, wins.

15:22.689 --> 15:24.291
Fine.

15:24.324 --> 15:25.325
All right, I'm in.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.962
Oh, Michelle.
Mrs. Peyser.

15:28.996 --> 15:30.630
How are you? Is everything okay?
What can I help you with?

15:30.663 --> 15:31.564
It's Henry here.

15:31.598 --> 15:34.034
He hasn't done number two
in five days.

15:35.668 --> 15:39.572
All right, you got
this champ, come on.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.441
That better be one
hell of a hunting lodge.

15:41.474 --> 15:42.542
Mm, mm, mm.

15:48.715 --> 15:50.050
I'm going to tell
you about the miracle

15:50.083 --> 15:52.986
that is the human
digestive system.

15:53.020 --> 15:55.688
See now, great moments were born
out of great opportunities.

15:55.722 --> 15:58.591
And this is your chance, Henry,
to show everyone out there

15:58.625 --> 16:01.128
that you were born to do this.

16:02.462 --> 16:03.430
So, you know how
when you have food,

16:03.463 --> 16:04.597
and you chew it up--

16:04.631 --> 16:05.598
num, num, num, num, num--

16:05.632 --> 16:07.134
the food's so good.

16:07.167 --> 16:09.669
Can you do this?
(grunting)

16:09.702 --> 16:12.739
Did you know sometimes
that there's gold in it?

16:12.772 --> 16:15.442
(grunting)

16:15.475 --> 16:17.744
(whispering):
I'll give you ten bucks.

16:17.777 --> 16:23.316
Henry, I think you can guess
where this goes.

16:23.350 --> 16:26.219
BRICK (laughing):
Whoo, hoo-ho-hoo.

16:26.253 --> 16:27.487
Thanks, Dr. Breeland.
Bye, now.

16:27.520 --> 16:30.257
Wow, you literally scared
the pooh out of him.

16:30.290 --> 16:32.725
I think I won the doctor-off.

16:32.759 --> 16:34.261
You get the weekend off,
that's it.

16:34.294 --> 16:35.762
Congratulations.

16:35.795 --> 16:37.530
FRANK:
Dr. Hart,

16:37.564 --> 16:39.232
uh, we had a canned goods
sale at the Dixie Stop,

16:39.266 --> 16:41.201
and now my carpel
tunnel's acting up.

16:41.234 --> 16:42.369
Frank.

16:42.402 --> 16:44.471
Dr. Breeland.

16:44.504 --> 16:46.639
Uh... is that you?

16:46.673 --> 16:48.741
My eyes aren't
so good either.

16:48.775 --> 16:50.477
Frank, why don't you just
head on in there.

16:50.510 --> 16:51.511
Huh? Oh.

16:51.544 --> 16:53.180
Okay.

16:53.213 --> 16:56.049
(sighs)
I'm sorry. I tried.

16:56.083 --> 16:57.550
I know.

17:00.253 --> 17:01.254
LEMON:
 What? Cancel the party?

17:01.288 --> 17:02.489
But it's tomorrow.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.491
I know, I know, but now
is just not a good time

17:04.523 --> 17:07.094
to tell everyone
about Shelby and me.

17:07.127 --> 17:09.096
I thought you didn't
care what people think?

17:09.128 --> 17:10.530
Well, I-I didn't,
until Zoe Hart

17:10.563 --> 17:12.299
saved everyone
in BlueBell,

17:12.332 --> 17:14.534
like Clara Barton
in shorty shorts.

17:14.567 --> 17:18.171
Look, I just can't afford
to lose another patient to her.

17:18.204 --> 17:21.473
And Shelby is half my age,

17:21.508 --> 17:24.810
and, you know, the people
in town might find it...

17:24.844 --> 17:26.512
A crime against nature?

17:26.546 --> 17:28.415
Don't you worry,
we'll call the whole thing off.

17:28.448 --> 17:29.616
It'll be fine.

17:29.649 --> 17:32.519
Oh, now why can't
everyone be just

17:32.552 --> 17:34.654
accepting
and understanding like you are?

17:40.760 --> 17:42.729
ANNABETH:
 I didn't hate gym class.

17:42.762 --> 17:44.864
I hated Coach Abernathy.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.599
The man was cool.
He had that awesome 'stache.

17:46.633 --> 17:47.634
It was not awesome.

17:47.667 --> 17:48.768
It looked like he
snorted a broom.

17:48.801 --> 17:51.204
You know, I forgot
how funny you are.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.642
Uh-oh, checking the watch,
not a good sign.

17:55.675 --> 17:59.679
I'm sorry, I just, I have a
lot on my mind right now.

17:59.712 --> 18:02.649
Want to talk about it?

18:06.486 --> 18:10.290
Um, thanks, but, um,
I really have to go.

18:16.729 --> 18:18.198
Hey, Jonah,

18:18.231 --> 18:19.699
big plans this weekend, bud?

18:19.732 --> 18:21.168
Apparently not.

18:21.201 --> 18:22.869
Good, 'cause I could use
a favor.

18:23.903 --> 18:25.405
Lavon.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.707
Wait, that wasn't
what it looked like.
Mm-hmm.

18:27.740 --> 18:30.643
Looked like you were on
a date with Jonah Breeland.

18:30.677 --> 18:33.880
Yeah, okay,
well... good eye.

18:33.913 --> 18:35.482
But...

18:35.515 --> 18:37.150
but it wasn't
a real date.

18:37.184 --> 18:40.153
Lemon was just testing me,

18:40.187 --> 18:42.755
because earlier today
I tried to tell her about us,

18:42.789 --> 18:45.692
but then she got suspicious
and she set me up with Jonah

18:45.725 --> 18:47.760
to make sure I don't
have feelings for you.

18:47.794 --> 18:50.363
So, you don't have
feelings for me?

18:50.397 --> 18:52.932
No, I do.

18:52.965 --> 18:55.568
I just missed my window of
opportunity to tell her that.

18:55.602 --> 18:57.737
Why would Lemon care that
you have feelings for me?

18:57.770 --> 18:59.639
She and I ended things
a long time ago.

18:59.672 --> 19:00.940
We both moved on.

19:00.973 --> 19:03.576
Yeah...

19:03.610 --> 19:05.412
AnnaBeth,

19:05.445 --> 19:09.616
Lemon and I have both
moved on, haven't we?

19:09.649 --> 19:11.584
Yeah...
Can we just pretend

19:11.618 --> 19:13.253
like the last 15 seconds
never happened?

19:13.286 --> 19:14.921
Okay.

19:14.954 --> 19:18.525
I'm not sure that they did.

19:18.558 --> 19:20.159
(crickets chirping)

19:21.828 --> 19:23.330
Huh.

19:23.363 --> 19:24.664
Yeah,

19:24.697 --> 19:27.267
this isn't going to work.

19:27.300 --> 19:28.368
Dolly Parton,
you need to go.

19:29.436 --> 19:31.204
Come on, hey.
No, no,

19:31.238 --> 19:33.273
see that face
is not going to work on me.

19:33.306 --> 19:34.541
There's a beautiful couch
right here,

19:34.574 --> 19:35.875
it's real comfortable.

19:35.908 --> 19:38.311
Good.
(sighs)

19:44.451 --> 19:45.485
Hey, great news.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.287
I found a doctor to cover
for you this weekend.

19:47.320 --> 19:48.388
Jonah Breeland.

19:48.421 --> 19:52.392
That's funny, but impersonating
a doctor is a felony.

19:52.425 --> 19:54.761
And, in prison, they would be
all over someone that pretty.

19:54.794 --> 19:56.596
Graduated with honors
from Duke Medical,

19:56.629 --> 19:58.698
just finished my residency
at Chicago General.

19:58.731 --> 20:00.767
Technically,
I'm on vacation.

20:00.800 --> 20:03.403
And you're welcome.

20:03.436 --> 20:05.538
See? Bona fide
smarty-pants.

20:05.572 --> 20:06.806
Now, come on, let's go.

20:08.575 --> 20:09.676
Wait.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.478
You know, I don't
know if Brick and I

20:11.511 --> 20:12.979
want to leave our
patients with a stranger.

20:13.012 --> 20:14.881
Dr. Hart? Dr. Hart?

20:16.383 --> 20:19.919
It-it's Bart, his feet,
they're...

20:19.952 --> 20:21.654
Jonah Breeland?

20:21.688 --> 20:23.890
Get over here
and give me a hug.

20:25.992 --> 20:27.594
Look at you.

20:27.627 --> 20:28.795
Hey, you guys
go have fun.

20:28.828 --> 20:29.829
I got this.

20:29.862 --> 20:30.897
See?

20:30.930 --> 20:32.299
SHULA:
Tell me you're staying in town.

20:32.332 --> 20:34.401
Come on.

20:34.434 --> 20:36.636
You look great.
(laughing)

20:44.644 --> 20:45.945
Rise and shine,

20:45.978 --> 20:48.548
I'm back.

20:48.581 --> 20:50.983
Um, where... is my baby girl?

20:51.017 --> 20:52.519
Oh, she just...

20:52.552 --> 20:54.687
she wanted to sleep
on the couch.

20:54.721 --> 20:56.789
She's not out
here, George.

20:56.823 --> 20:59.292
Please tell me this
is some kind of prank,

20:59.326 --> 21:01.594
and she's really hiding
in your closet.

21:01.628 --> 21:04.564
No, (scoffs)
no, she's-she's-she's out here.

21:04.597 --> 21:06.766
She's out here...

21:06.799 --> 21:08.668
somewhere.

21:08.701 --> 21:10.470
Uh, okay. Uh...

21:10.503 --> 21:12.739
Tansy, baby, I need you to, uh,

21:12.772 --> 21:14.907
just stay calm, okay?

21:14.941 --> 21:17.577
My baby, she is
out there, alone.

21:17.610 --> 21:18.778
On the streets.

21:18.811 --> 21:21.581
Yeah. And we will-we will
find her, okay?

21:21.614 --> 21:24.283
But what if we don't, George?

21:26.419 --> 21:29.922
My whole life
has been a constant stream

21:29.956 --> 21:31.858
of guys walking all over me,

21:31.891 --> 21:35.294
and Dolly has been the one
thing I could count on.

21:36.596 --> 21:38.030
Okay, okay.

21:38.064 --> 21:40.700
Here's what we do:

21:40.733 --> 21:43.002
I need you to find
a picture of her

21:43.035 --> 21:45.004
and I need you
to make a flyer.

21:45.037 --> 21:47.707
I have one of her smiling.

21:47.740 --> 21:49.709
Or do you want
a serious one?

21:49.742 --> 21:52.412
No, no, smiling...
smiling's real good.

21:52.445 --> 21:54.013
Okay.
Okay?

21:59.552 --> 22:01.421
Wow.

22:01.454 --> 22:03.823
It's so rustic and charming.

22:03.856 --> 22:05.625
I feel like I'm in
a Folgers commercial.

22:05.658 --> 22:07.660
Well, what did you expect?

22:07.694 --> 22:09.396
Well, you said
"hunting lodge."

22:09.429 --> 22:12.432
My mind went to
some dark places.

22:12.465 --> 22:14.901
Ooh, this bed's got
good spring to it.

22:14.934 --> 22:15.968
Come here,
let's test drive

22:16.002 --> 22:17.069
this bad bear,
come on.

22:17.103 --> 22:19.372
Okay, but I have
to check my messages.

22:19.406 --> 22:21.073
I'm not getting
any service.

22:21.107 --> 22:23.109
Well, what does that matter?

22:23.142 --> 22:26.112
We came here to get away
from it all-- that is the all.

22:26.145 --> 22:28.381
I'm a doctor--
I have to be reachable

22:28.415 --> 22:29.449
in an emergency.

22:29.482 --> 22:30.950
(cell phone chimes)

22:30.983 --> 22:32.919
See? I just missed a call
from AnnaBeth.

22:32.952 --> 22:34.454
I have to find service
so I can call her back.

22:34.487 --> 22:36.523
Oh, come on, it's not
like she's dying.

22:36.556 --> 22:37.724
We are all dying.

22:37.757 --> 22:38.925
Just at different rates.

22:38.958 --> 22:41.561
Well, enough of
the sexy talk.

22:41.594 --> 22:43.663
Look, if you need bars,
you can hike up to the top

22:43.696 --> 22:44.864
of the hill there.

22:44.897 --> 22:47.534
Okay, when I get back, we'll
take this puppy for a spin.

22:47.567 --> 22:49.502
Ooh.
(quiet laugh)

22:52.539 --> 22:53.973
Shelby, thank you so
much for meeting me.

22:54.006 --> 22:55.875
Oh, are you kidding me?
This'll be fun.

22:55.908 --> 22:57.644
I'll be like the big sister
you never had.

22:57.677 --> 22:59.812
Except I have one.

22:59.846 --> 23:03.616
Well, I'll be like
the one you never had.

23:03.650 --> 23:05.852
(both laugh)

23:05.885 --> 23:07.887
I was just so bummed
your dad cancelled the party.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.656
I wanted to take you
dress shopping.

23:09.689 --> 23:11.491
Well, about that,
you should know

23:11.524 --> 23:13.159
that Daddy cancels his party
every year.

23:13.192 --> 23:14.727
Oh.

23:14.761 --> 23:16.863
And then every year we throw him
a surprise party.

23:16.896 --> 23:19.466
Oh, it's just this silly
little game we play.

23:19.499 --> 23:20.633
Oh, thank God.

23:20.667 --> 23:22.435
For a second there, I...

23:22.469 --> 23:24.904
I thought he didn't want to
introduce me to his friends.

23:24.937 --> 23:26.773
Oh, no. No.

23:26.806 --> 23:28.608
I am sure he's dying

23:28.641 --> 23:29.776
to show you off.

23:29.809 --> 23:31.110
you are like a Barbie that is

23:31.143 --> 23:32.712
barely out of its box.

23:32.745 --> 23:35.114
Oh, thank you.

23:35.147 --> 23:39.118
So, how do we make this party
one this town will never forget?

23:39.151 --> 23:40.687
AnnaBeth, you didn't.

23:40.720 --> 23:42.789
I know, it just slipped out.

23:42.822 --> 23:44.557
I told him to forget
I said anything.

23:44.591 --> 23:45.758
You think he did?

23:45.792 --> 23:47.794
He played football-- maybe he
got hit in the head a lot.

23:47.827 --> 23:49.462
(call waiting beeps)

23:49.496 --> 23:51.864
Well, looks like
we're gonna find out.

23:51.898 --> 23:52.965
That's him on the other line.

23:52.999 --> 23:53.833
You call me back!

23:53.866 --> 23:56.035
Okay.

23:56.068 --> 23:57.036
Hey.

23:57.069 --> 23:57.870
Oh, oh, good you're there.

23:57.904 --> 23:59.706
Look, I need
to ask you something.

23:59.739 --> 24:02.008
Um, do you think it's
possible Lemon Breeland

24:02.041 --> 24:03.109
still has feelings for me?

24:03.142 --> 24:05.678
I really don't know.

24:05.712 --> 24:07.714
Well, look, I know you don't
know, but what do you think?

24:07.747 --> 24:09.248
I mean, she did bid
on my basket

24:09.281 --> 24:10.783
at auction.

24:10.817 --> 24:12.652
And then she told Ruby
about the affair.

24:12.685 --> 24:15.688
She did have feelings for you
during the election.

24:15.722 --> 24:17.524
Hold the roll.

24:17.557 --> 24:19.091
You knew and you didn't tell me?

24:19.125 --> 24:20.727
Well, because you had moved on

24:20.760 --> 24:22.795
and I knew how you felt
about Ruby.

24:22.829 --> 24:24.664
It was really hard keeping
all the storylines straight.

24:24.697 --> 24:25.732
I stopped watching
 Game of Thrones

24:25.765 --> 24:26.899
after the first episode,

24:26.933 --> 24:28.134
let me tell you.

24:28.167 --> 24:30.169
(phone beeps)
Lav... Lavon?

24:31.270 --> 24:33.105
(groans)

24:33.139 --> 24:35.107
(phone rings)

24:35.141 --> 24:36.709
Dr. Hart? It's Cody.

24:36.743 --> 24:38.244
Cody?

24:38.277 --> 24:39.979
Hey, Cody. How's the ankle?

24:40.012 --> 24:41.948
It's swelled up
like a pickled pig's foot.

24:41.981 --> 24:43.550
You got a sec to check it out?

24:43.583 --> 24:45.151
You know what? I am out of town
for the weekend

24:45.184 --> 24:47.219
but I can see you first thing
Monday morning.

24:47.253 --> 24:48.955
No, no, it's all right.

24:48.988 --> 24:50.823
We're all going down to the
doctor's office later.

24:50.857 --> 24:52.559
I'll just get Jonah
to look at it.

24:52.592 --> 24:54.527
Wait, I'm sorry, you're all
headed to the doctor's office?

24:54.561 --> 24:55.995
What for?
(phone beeps)

24:56.028 --> 24:58.798
Cody? Cody.

24:58.831 --> 25:00.032
(groans)

25:02.201 --> 25:04.103
Come on.

25:04.136 --> 25:06.305
(yells)

25:06.338 --> 25:08.775
(screams)

25:11.678 --> 25:13.913
(knocking on door)

25:15.014 --> 25:16.649
Okay, this is awkward,

25:16.683 --> 25:18.284
so I'm just gonna say it.

25:18.317 --> 25:20.019
I'm not in love
with Lemon anymore,

25:20.052 --> 25:22.021
even if she is still
in love with me.

25:22.054 --> 25:25.024
I never should have
let that slip.

25:25.057 --> 25:28.761
I continue my campaign to be
the worst best friend ever.

25:28.795 --> 25:30.730
So, she is.

25:31.998 --> 25:34.033
You know, I'm honestly not sure.

25:34.066 --> 25:36.535
She was.

25:37.837 --> 25:40.006
Well, look, you didn't
mean for this to happen.

25:40.039 --> 25:43.275
But it's happening
and we can't deny it.

25:43.309 --> 25:45.712
And Lemon seems really happy
with Walt.

25:45.745 --> 25:48.014
That's true.

25:49.215 --> 25:51.751
I think she's moved on.

25:51.784 --> 25:53.319
I hope she has.

25:53.352 --> 25:54.621
She deserves to be happy.

25:56.222 --> 25:58.024
Just like I deserve to be happy.

26:01.027 --> 26:02.895
And you make me happy.

26:02.929 --> 26:05.998
You make me happy, too.

26:13.706 --> 26:15.842
Would you like me
to speak to her?

26:15.875 --> 26:18.678
No, I need to do it.

26:18.711 --> 26:20.947
Okay, good luck with that.

26:20.980 --> 26:22.949
(laughs)

26:22.982 --> 26:25.184
(door opens, then closes,
Zoe sighs)

26:25.217 --> 26:27.386
(laughs)
Don't.

26:27.419 --> 26:30.723
You know, when I told you about
my little mud wrestling fantasy,

26:30.757 --> 26:32.258
this isn't exactly
how I pictured it.

26:32.291 --> 26:34.226
I fell down the hill
looking for cell service.

26:34.260 --> 26:36.395
In the movies, it's zany--
it did not feel zany.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.698
Look, why don't I run you a
bath, we'll get you cleaned up

26:38.731 --> 26:40.633
and once you're clean, I'll join
you and we'll get dirty again.

26:43.069 --> 26:44.971
You know, Cody told me
that everyone was going

26:45.004 --> 26:46.673
to the doctor's office--
what do you think that means?

26:46.706 --> 26:49.208
I don't know, maybe Jonah
Breeland's having one

26:49.241 --> 26:50.209
of his famous poker games.

26:50.242 --> 26:51.711
But those are my patients.

26:51.744 --> 26:53.179
What if he's not even any good?

26:53.212 --> 26:56.749
Or worse yet, what if he is?

26:56.783 --> 26:58.317
Face it, Doc,

26:58.350 --> 27:00.219
the whole town's been treating
you like Princess Leia

27:00.252 --> 27:02.989
at a Star Wars convention,
and you love it.

27:03.022 --> 27:05.725
Okay, well, yeah,
so what if I do?

27:05.758 --> 27:07.727
Well, I'm just trying to spend
some quality time with you

27:07.760 --> 27:09.395
and you're so desperate
for your fans' attention...

27:09.428 --> 27:11.397
There is nothing wrong
with enjoying it

27:11.430 --> 27:13.065
when people appreciate
your work.

27:13.099 --> 27:14.934
All right, but it's a fine
line between enjoying it

27:14.967 --> 27:16.936
and being addicted to it
is all I'm saying.

27:16.969 --> 27:18.137
It's called
"career satisfaction."

27:18.170 --> 27:20.372
And you would understand
that if you...

27:23.275 --> 27:25.411
That came out wrong.

27:25.444 --> 27:27.680
(quietly):
Oh.

27:30.116 --> 27:32.051
Look, why don't
I take you home?

27:34.754 --> 27:36.689
Wade.

27:44.831 --> 27:47.299
A toast to a delicious dinner
with my daughters

27:47.333 --> 27:49.168
and my girlfriend.

27:49.201 --> 27:50.236
(cell phone chimes)
I can't imagine

27:50.269 --> 27:52.171
a more perfect
birthday.

27:52.204 --> 27:53.906
And the night is still young.

27:53.940 --> 27:55.374
Yes, it is.

27:56.342 --> 27:58.277
Mm...

27:58.310 --> 28:01.247
Will you excuse us?
We need to go cut the cake.

28:01.280 --> 28:03.950
Mm.
What?

28:03.983 --> 28:05.785
I'm getting excited now.

28:05.818 --> 28:07.820
Aren't they too cute?
Don't you love her dress?

28:07.854 --> 28:10.222
Why did I just get an Evite to
my own father's surprise party?

28:10.256 --> 28:12.992
I was waiting
to surprise you, too,

28:13.025 --> 28:15.461
but I convinced Shelby
to pop out of a giant cake

28:15.494 --> 28:16.929
I borrowed from Dash DeWitt

28:16.963 --> 28:19.331
and serenade Daddy
with a sexy song.

28:19.365 --> 28:20.332
(gasps)

28:20.366 --> 28:21.333
Magnolia!

28:21.367 --> 28:22.334
And don't even ask

28:22.368 --> 28:23.936
why Dash has a giant prop cake.

28:23.970 --> 28:25.404
I just somehow knew he would.

28:25.437 --> 28:27.406
No, you didn't.

28:27.439 --> 28:28.841
Yes, I did.

28:28.875 --> 28:30.509
Oh, Lemon,
it'll be such a scandal.

28:30.542 --> 28:33.846
Daddy will have to dump Shelby
in order to keep his patients.

28:33.880 --> 28:35.414
What is wrong with you?

28:35.447 --> 28:38.117
Daddy specifically told us that
this would hurt his practice.

28:39.551 --> 28:43.155
Well, I decided our happiness
was more important than his.

28:43.189 --> 28:45.524
I learned it
from you.

28:45.557 --> 28:47.126
I thought you'd be proud.

28:48.394 --> 28:50.997
Well, I'm not proud.

28:51.030 --> 28:54.266
Not of you and particularly
not of me, okay?

28:54.300 --> 28:56.135
I am not that person anymore.

28:56.168 --> 28:58.805
I am better than that.
And so are you.

28:58.838 --> 29:00.372
Oh, girls.

29:00.406 --> 29:02.241
Jonah just called,
he said Clive Baker's appendix

29:02.274 --> 29:03.943
is about to burst,

29:03.976 --> 29:05.845
which is odd because I removed
it when he was 12.

29:05.878 --> 29:07.246
I'm gonna get my bag,

29:07.279 --> 29:08.480
and Shelby's gonna drive me
to the office.

29:08.514 --> 29:10.983
But do not cut that cake
till I get back.

29:15.287 --> 29:17.223
I'll talk to her.

29:19.058 --> 29:21.027
(sighs)

29:22.428 --> 29:24.263
Plan in motion--
I'll see you at the party.

29:24.296 --> 29:26.933
Shelby, wait.

29:26.966 --> 29:30.136
I've been thinking and your sexy
cake dance tonight might be

29:30.169 --> 29:31.804
a terrible idea.

29:31.838 --> 29:34.006
Oh, you're nervous for me.

29:34.040 --> 29:36.008
Don't be-- I'm
really talented.

29:36.042 --> 29:39.078
I lied to you before.

29:39.111 --> 29:41.213
Daddy cancelled his party
'cause he's worried

29:41.247 --> 29:42.882
he'll lose his patients
when they find out

29:42.915 --> 29:44.250
you two are dating.

29:45.317 --> 29:46.919
Oh.

29:48.454 --> 29:50.089
So this was your plan
to get rid of me?

29:50.122 --> 29:51.290
I'm sorry.

29:51.323 --> 29:54.393
I'm 15--
we make very poor decisions.

29:54.426 --> 29:55.627
You can look it up.

29:55.661 --> 29:58.965
Mm-hmm, okay, well, thank you
for bringing me up to speed.

30:00.299 --> 30:01.433
Ready?

30:01.467 --> 30:03.169
Bye now.

30:03.202 --> 30:04.971
Bye, wh... Wait.

30:05.004 --> 30:06.505
Wait, so...

30:06.538 --> 30:08.340
What does that even mean?

30:08.374 --> 30:11.243
Yeah, well, thank you very much,
Sheriff Bill.

30:11.277 --> 30:12.478
Just call me if you hear
anything, all right?

30:12.511 --> 30:14.480
Thanks.

30:17.083 --> 30:19.251
Dolly Parton!

30:19.285 --> 30:21.220
(dog whimpering nearby)

30:22.621 --> 30:24.556
Dolly.

30:26.225 --> 30:27.559
Dolly?

30:27.593 --> 30:29.095
Hey. (whistles)

30:29.128 --> 30:30.596
Dolly?

30:30.629 --> 30:32.932
(dog whimpering, barks)

30:32.965 --> 30:34.533
(grunts)

30:34.566 --> 30:36.068
(laughs)

30:36.102 --> 30:37.870
Okay, all right.

30:37.904 --> 30:39.171
It's all right, girl,
it's all right.

30:39.205 --> 30:40.472
We're gonna get you
out of there.

30:40.506 --> 30:43.910
You just got
to come over here.

30:43.943 --> 30:45.644
Scared of water, that's right.
Okay, hey.

30:45.677 --> 30:47.613
Hey, hey, girl, listen, hey.

30:47.646 --> 30:49.115
Look, it's not so bad.

30:49.148 --> 30:50.249
I'm coming.

30:50.282 --> 30:52.451
It's not so bad--
the water's not so bad.

30:52.484 --> 30:55.321
Oh, oh, oh, oh...
how's that song go?

30:55.354 --> 30:56.989
Ah, this is ridiculous.

30:57.023 --> 30:58.057
(sighs)

30:58.090 --> 31:00.259
* Jolene, Jolene

31:00.292 --> 31:03.996
* Jolene,
Jolene *

31:05.397 --> 31:06.933
* I'm begging of you

31:06.966 --> 31:09.101
* Please don't take my man

31:09.135 --> 31:10.169
(Dolly Parton barks)

31:10.202 --> 31:11.938
It's not enough? (laughs)

31:11.971 --> 31:14.540
You're gonna make me sing
this whole thing, aren't you?

31:14.573 --> 31:16.075
(laughs)
I'm singing to a dog.

31:16.108 --> 31:19.078
* Jolene, Jolene

31:19.111 --> 31:21.047
* Jolene,
Jolene *

31:21.080 --> 31:25.117
* Please don't take him
just because you can. *

31:25.151 --> 31:27.186
That's it, girl.
That's it, whoo.

31:27.219 --> 31:29.588
All right.
Oh, good girl.

31:29.621 --> 31:30.990
Good girl.

31:31.023 --> 31:32.959
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho.

31:32.992 --> 31:36.162
Yeah, ah, oh, my goodness, oh.

31:48.274 --> 31:49.575
Wade...

31:49.608 --> 31:51.177
that came out all wrong.

31:51.210 --> 31:52.678
You know that I'm sorry, right?

31:53.745 --> 31:55.147
I know.

31:56.482 --> 31:57.683
I'm just gonna go check on Jonah

31:57.716 --> 31:59.685
and then I'll meet you
back at your place?

32:02.421 --> 32:03.922
Take your time.

32:13.065 --> 32:15.034
(indistinct chatter)

32:24.043 --> 32:26.245
I can't believe you people.

32:27.579 --> 32:30.616
I worked my butt off getting
you through the flu.

32:30.649 --> 32:33.719
I stayed up three nights in
a row making house calls.

32:33.752 --> 32:36.522
I even neglected my own
relationship. Why?

32:36.555 --> 32:38.157
Because I felt needed.

32:38.190 --> 32:39.691
I felt appreciated.

32:39.725 --> 32:41.227
Then this guy comes to town,

32:41.260 --> 32:44.096
you toss me aside like
last season's sweaters.

32:44.130 --> 32:47.199
Shame on you BlueBell,
shame on you.

32:47.233 --> 32:49.468
What is going on here?

32:49.501 --> 32:52.304
ALL:
Surprise!

32:52.338 --> 32:55.307
(horns blowing)

32:55.341 --> 32:57.043
Surprise.

32:57.076 --> 32:58.544
(laughter)

32:58.577 --> 33:01.380
Happy Birthday, Brick.

33:01.413 --> 33:05.084
I'm just gonna... go...

33:05.117 --> 33:07.186
over in the corner.

33:13.592 --> 33:14.693
Lemon, have you seen Shelby?

33:14.726 --> 33:16.195
Please tell me that
you spoke to her

33:16.228 --> 33:18.130
and she's not gonna
humiliate us all

33:18.164 --> 33:19.365
with a burlesque routine.

33:19.398 --> 33:21.467
Well, I did speak to her,

33:21.500 --> 33:23.402
and I told her
I didn't think the cake

33:23.435 --> 33:24.636
was a good idea.

33:24.670 --> 33:26.238
And?

33:26.272 --> 33:29.175
And I'm sure everything
will be fine.

33:29.208 --> 33:31.077
(sighs)

33:31.110 --> 33:33.479
Okay, crisis averted.

33:33.512 --> 33:35.147
Lesson learned.

33:35.181 --> 33:36.615
Uh, Magnolia,

33:36.648 --> 33:37.816
I'm sorry.

33:37.849 --> 33:39.385
Can I have a minute
with Lemon?

33:39.418 --> 33:41.720
Mm-hmm.

33:41.753 --> 33:43.655
So?

33:43.689 --> 33:45.391
How was your date with Jonah?

33:45.424 --> 33:46.658
Can I be the maid of honor

33:46.692 --> 33:48.594
at your wedding because
I prepared a toast,

33:48.627 --> 33:50.229
and it is a real weeper.

33:50.262 --> 33:52.664
Lemon, we need to talk.

33:56.435 --> 34:00.339
Those feelings I had for Lavon
during the election...

34:01.673 --> 34:03.442
...I still have them.

34:03.475 --> 34:07.679
And lately there's been
this spark between us.

34:07.713 --> 34:10.416
It-it took me completely
by surprise,

34:10.449 --> 34:12.551
I promise.

34:12.583 --> 34:15.221
Something already happened
between you two, hasn't it?

34:16.322 --> 34:18.257
Yes.

34:21.127 --> 34:23.262
I'm so sorry.

34:23.295 --> 34:26.165
You... say something.

34:26.197 --> 34:28.234
Anything, please.

34:30.335 --> 34:33.239
I have been trying...

34:33.272 --> 34:36.475
so hard

34:36.507 --> 34:38.476
to be a very kind

34:38.510 --> 34:41.147
and forgiving person.

34:43.215 --> 34:46.185
But right now, I'm feeling
like I want to do something

34:46.217 --> 34:48.286
very unladylike.

34:50.222 --> 34:52.224
You were the only person

34:52.257 --> 34:54.226
who knew how I really felt.

34:54.260 --> 34:56.228
And I don't think that
I can ever look at you

34:56.262 --> 34:57.596
the same way again.

35:02.468 --> 35:03.769
All right, see to...
Oh, Lemon.

35:03.802 --> 35:06.305
Lemon, I know I said
I didn't want a party,

35:06.338 --> 35:08.640
but I am really having fun.

35:08.674 --> 35:10.576
But where's Shelby?

35:10.609 --> 35:12.478
(crowd gasps)
Daddy, um...

35:12.511 --> 35:14.746
(music playing)

35:16.248 --> 35:18.750
Happy birthday!

35:18.784 --> 35:20.519
(squeaks)

35:25.824 --> 35:28.360
* Never know how much
I love you *

35:28.394 --> 35:32.764
* Never know how much I care

35:32.798 --> 35:35.634
* When you put your arms
around me *

35:35.667 --> 35:38.170
* I get a fever
that's so hard to bear *

35:38.204 --> 35:41.240
* You give me fever

35:41.273 --> 35:43.342
* When you kiss me

35:43.375 --> 35:46.178
* Fever when you hold me tight

35:46.212 --> 35:48.380
* Fever

35:48.414 --> 35:50.316
* In the morning

35:50.349 --> 35:53.785
* And fever
all through the night... *

35:53.819 --> 35:55.887
Whoo.

35:55.921 --> 35:57.856
(Jonah chuckles)

36:01.627 --> 36:04.263
Well, this party
just got weirder.

36:04.296 --> 36:05.531
* You give me fever

36:05.564 --> 36:07.299
(glove snaps, crowd gasps)

36:07.333 --> 36:09.401
* When you kiss me

36:09.435 --> 36:11.770
* Fever when you hold me tight

36:11.803 --> 36:13.639
* Fever!

36:14.606 --> 36:15.841
God, I miss BlueBell.

36:15.874 --> 36:18.910
BlueBell misses
you, too, clearly.

36:19.978 --> 36:22.848
It's hard to leave
a place like this.

36:22.881 --> 36:24.950
Thank God Dash's blog
keeps me connected.

36:24.983 --> 36:26.184
(chuckles)

36:26.218 --> 36:29.421
You know, and he's
always mentioning
this mythical Zoe Hart.

36:29.455 --> 36:31.590
Shut up. He does?

36:33.325 --> 36:34.960
All I've heard
since you arrived in BlueBell

36:34.993 --> 36:36.828
is how amazing you are,

36:36.862 --> 36:38.764
how much you've done
for this town,

36:38.797 --> 36:40.432
blah, blah, blah.

36:40.466 --> 36:41.967
Even Brick will admit it

36:42.000 --> 36:43.535
if he's drunk enough.

36:43.569 --> 36:44.636
Whoa.

36:44.670 --> 36:47.439
* Give us fever...

36:47.473 --> 36:48.974
* When we kiss it...

36:49.007 --> 36:50.309
So you can relax.

36:50.342 --> 36:51.843
You're beloved.

36:51.877 --> 36:52.978
Thank you.

36:53.011 --> 36:55.481
Thank you
for letting me sub today.

36:57.015 --> 36:58.984
You know, I never considered
coming back here

36:59.017 --> 37:00.952
and opening up shop.

37:00.986 --> 37:02.988
Maybe I should.

37:03.021 --> 37:04.490
It's kind of rewarding.

37:04.523 --> 37:06.325
It is,

37:06.358 --> 37:08.460
but we've got
plenty of doctors,

37:08.494 --> 37:09.695
so thank you.

37:09.728 --> 37:11.997
And more than enough Breelands.

37:12.030 --> 37:13.632
Mm-hmm.

37:14.600 --> 37:17.403
* What a lovely way

37:17.436 --> 37:20.005
* To burn.

37:20.038 --> 37:21.640
(music ends)

37:26.512 --> 37:28.480
(applause, laughter)

37:35.487 --> 37:37.756
Uh, everyone,

37:37.789 --> 37:39.891
um, this is Shelby,

37:39.925 --> 37:42.761
my girlfriend.

37:42.794 --> 37:44.262
(applause)

37:46.332 --> 37:48.367
They love her.

37:48.400 --> 37:50.636
Your plan
was total amateur hour.

37:50.669 --> 37:52.504
You played right
into her strengths.

37:52.538 --> 37:54.039
Well, I was
counting on you,

37:54.072 --> 37:55.974
but you had to be
all Lemon 2.0.

37:56.007 --> 37:57.576
Who am I kidding?

37:57.609 --> 38:01.780
At best I am Lemon 1.5.

38:01.813 --> 38:03.048
Don't you worry.

38:03.081 --> 38:04.550
She won't be our new stepmother.

38:04.583 --> 38:05.884
Oh, thank God. Can you imagine

38:05.917 --> 38:07.686
having to spend Christmas
with that woman?

38:07.719 --> 38:09.321
Oh, gracious, no.

38:09.355 --> 38:12.591
She'd figure out a way to pop
out of a Christmas turkey.

38:12.624 --> 38:14.092
(groans)

38:14.125 --> 38:16.662
George, I'm com...

38:16.695 --> 38:18.497
How is she?

38:18.530 --> 38:19.798
She had a tough day,

38:19.831 --> 38:21.066
but she's, uh,

38:21.099 --> 38:24.002
she's gonna be just fine.

38:24.035 --> 38:26.538
Dolly, baby, I
missed you so much.

38:26.572 --> 38:29.441
Look,

38:29.475 --> 38:31.510
Tansy, I, uh,

38:31.543 --> 38:34.112
I know that a lot of guys
have disappointed you

38:34.145 --> 38:37.983
in the past,
but I will not do that.

38:38.016 --> 38:39.985
Listen, Dolly Parton is...

38:40.018 --> 38:42.388
She's not the only one
you can count on anymore.

38:45.624 --> 38:47.659
I am so...

38:47.693 --> 38:50.696
turned on right now.

38:50.729 --> 38:52.063
(clears throat)
So am I.

38:52.097 --> 38:54.099
But you're gonna have
to move her,

38:54.132 --> 38:56.635
because she's too cute,

38:56.668 --> 38:58.036
and I can't do it.

38:58.069 --> 38:59.838
(laughing):
She is, isn't she?

38:59.871 --> 39:02.107
Oh, oh.

39:05.143 --> 39:06.845
(door opens)

39:09.180 --> 39:10.782
(sighs)

39:10.816 --> 39:12.951
I come in peace

39:12.984 --> 39:15.454
with a bouquet of apologies.

39:15.487 --> 39:17.355
Next time, try bourbon.

39:19.057 --> 39:20.692
You were right.

39:20.726 --> 39:22.961
I have been putting work
before our relationship,

39:22.994 --> 39:25.564
which is why I booked
us a room next weekend

39:25.597 --> 39:26.765
at the Whippoorwill Blossom.

39:26.798 --> 39:27.899
Wow.

39:27.933 --> 39:31.102
No phones. Have you ever done
it on a four-poster bed?

39:31.136 --> 39:33.472
Nope. Did it in
a pet cemetery one time.

39:33.505 --> 39:34.773
Didn't ask.

39:36.642 --> 39:38.610
(clears throat)

39:40.045 --> 39:42.514
I feel really bad
about what I said,

39:42.548 --> 39:45.717
about you not having had...

39:45.751 --> 39:47.553
A career.

39:47.586 --> 39:49.721
You're right, you know?

39:49.755 --> 39:52.157
And I never looked forward
to going into work.

39:52.190 --> 39:55.393
Except when I was working
on this.

39:58.730 --> 40:00.799
Plans for your bar?

40:00.832 --> 40:03.735
Don't know why
I gave up on it.

40:03.769 --> 40:05.904
But you know, I...

40:05.937 --> 40:09.608
I think I might be willing
to give it another shot.

40:16.181 --> 40:19.050
I'm sorry, Lavon, but no.

40:19.084 --> 40:20.786
Whatever this is,
it has to end now.

40:20.819 --> 40:21.920
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.

40:21.953 --> 40:23.755
No.

40:23.789 --> 40:25.557
I should never have slept
with you.

40:25.591 --> 40:26.792
It was wrong.

40:26.825 --> 40:29.661
We-we make each other happy.

40:29.695 --> 40:31.196
You said so.

40:31.229 --> 40:34.866
I don't deserve to be happy...

40:36.835 --> 40:39.705
...until I can win back
Lemon's trust.

40:51.683 --> 40:54.486
Just so you know,
I turned off my phone.

40:54.520 --> 40:56.087
Well, (clears throat)

40:56.121 --> 40:57.723
I'll toast to that.

40:57.756 --> 41:00.091
I'm not thirsty.

41:00.125 --> 41:03.695
Oh, well, come here.

41:08.099 --> 41:10.569
(knocking on door)

41:10.602 --> 41:11.837
Don't get that.

41:11.870 --> 41:13.138
They can call Brick.

41:13.171 --> 41:14.706
LAVON:
Hey, you guys in there?

41:14.740 --> 41:16.141
It's me, Lavon.

41:16.174 --> 41:18.209
I just got dumped.

41:18.243 --> 41:20.111
Oh.
No.

41:23.715 --> 41:26.117
Help me eat my feelings.

41:26.151 --> 41:27.553
(chuckles sadly)

41:29.621 --> 41:32.057
I am a former NFL player.

41:32.090 --> 41:34.726
It shouldn't be this hard
to find love.

41:36.695 --> 41:39.130
When do I get to be happy?

41:39.164 --> 41:41.032
Chocolate?

41:41.066 --> 41:42.534
Yeah.
It might help.

41:42.568 --> 41:44.502
(chuckles)
