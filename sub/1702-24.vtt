00:02.293 --> 00:05.754
Do you think there's a town
in Missouri or someplace...

00:05.964 --> 00:07.339
...called Sample?

00:07.590 --> 00:11.510
And as you're driving into the town,
there's a sign and it says:

00:11.761 --> 00:13.762
"You're in Sample."

00:16.306 --> 00:17.766
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:18.018 --> 00:20.102
- How did it go with Pete?
- Tell us.

00:20.270 --> 00:22.604
You're not gonna believe this.
So I go...

00:22.814 --> 00:24.815
I'm sorry. Excuse us.

00:28.111 --> 00:30.946
- It's a little crowded. Do you mind?
- Could you skooch?

00:31.448 --> 00:33.115
Move over just a little bit.

00:34.492 --> 00:35.784
Keep on skooching.

00:36.161 --> 00:37.202
Thank you.

00:37.370 --> 00:40.873
So, guys, listen.
I go over there and, you know, I'm...

00:41.124 --> 00:43.125
Why? What is wrong with me?

00:43.334 --> 00:45.169
- What's the matter?
- Tim...

00:45.462 --> 00:47.171
...I have a feeling...

00:47.380 --> 00:51.133
...my wife is sleeping
with her gynecologist.

00:53.970 --> 00:55.137
How do you know?

00:55.388 --> 00:56.972
- He's got access.
- I know.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.559
It's a feeling you get.

01:00.810 --> 01:03.020
Like when you're in
somebody else's bowling shoes?

01:03.313 --> 01:04.313
That's the one.

01:05.899 --> 01:08.317
- So you went to Pete's.
- What happened?

01:08.526 --> 01:10.819
Why is this happening to me?

01:11.071 --> 01:12.654
Maybe it's my wound.

01:12.947 --> 01:13.989
Forget it.

01:15.867 --> 01:17.326
It's not healed yet?

01:17.535 --> 01:18.911
It's oozing!

01:19.370 --> 01:21.830
Would you pass the cream?
There's the cream.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.499
Thank you very much.

01:24.542 --> 01:28.504
Tomas, this is gonna be hard,
but I wanted it to come from me.

01:28.671 --> 01:31.381
- What is it?
- I've been sleeping with your wife.

01:31.674 --> 01:32.674
You're the gynecologist?

01:32.926 --> 01:35.677
I'm trying to have
a private conversation.

01:37.430 --> 01:40.307
Can I have a napkin?
Could you please hand me a napkin?

01:40.517 --> 01:42.893
Just give me the thing, all right?

01:44.187 --> 01:45.229
Enough!

01:45.522 --> 01:47.856
And you are no longer my friend!

01:48.066 --> 01:50.067
We are finished! Nada! No more!

01:50.360 --> 01:52.319
You are a bastard for doing that!

01:52.529 --> 01:54.029
Stay away from me!

01:54.864 --> 01:55.864
Come back!

02:04.207 --> 02:07.042
So what were you gonna tell us?

02:08.044 --> 02:09.211
I have no idea.

03:00.597 --> 03:03.223
What was the big news
Pete wanted to tell you?

03:03.474 --> 03:05.684
Or should I say, "Mrs. Monica Becker"?

03:06.477 --> 03:08.812
Oh, keep your name.
Don't take his name.

03:09.105 --> 03:10.272
He didn't ask me to marry him.

03:10.440 --> 03:13.859
- Aw.
- Then definitely don't take his name!

03:15.361 --> 03:18.822
He wanted to tell me he's going
to compete in some Ultimate...

03:19.032 --> 03:20.824
...Fighting Competition thingy.

03:21.034 --> 03:23.410
- Pete?
- Why? What is it?

03:23.661 --> 03:26.246
I don't know exactly.
It's sort of like wrestling.

03:26.456 --> 03:28.707
- Oh?
- But without the costumes.

03:28.875 --> 03:30.459
Oh.

03:30.627 --> 03:32.878
And it's not fake.
It's totally brutal.

03:33.129 --> 03:37.341
It's two guys in the ring and
the rules are, "There are no rules"!

03:38.218 --> 03:40.761
You can bite and pull
people's hair and stuff?

03:41.012 --> 03:44.264
Anything goes except eye-gouging
and fish-hooking.

03:44.474 --> 03:46.934
- What's fish-hooking?
- What's fish-hook...

03:49.562 --> 03:52.522
Thanks. That would have been
hard to describe.

03:52.899 --> 03:54.399
What is that taste?

03:55.068 --> 03:58.654
My hands are totally clean.
I just gave the duck a bath.

04:02.492 --> 04:04.034
Thanks for the warm welcome.

04:04.327 --> 04:08.705
It's good to have you guys on my team.
I come to play. I hope you do too.

04:08.957 --> 04:11.416
Let's go out there and get them!
And remember:

04:11.668 --> 04:14.211
There is no I in "team."

04:14.462 --> 04:18.464
Yes, but there's two in "martini."
So, everybody, back to my office.

04:19.466 --> 04:22.302
You! Chuckles. What's your name?

04:22.553 --> 04:24.638
It's Bing, sir.
I'm sorry. I was just...

04:24.889 --> 04:28.267
No, no. I heard what you said.
Funny. I like funny.

04:28.559 --> 04:31.436
This team's about hard work,
but it's also about having fun.

04:31.688 --> 04:33.689
Good to have you aboard, Bing!

04:40.905 --> 04:42.406
That's right. Ryder.

04:43.116 --> 04:45.492
Winona Ryder for six.

04:48.037 --> 04:49.079
Thank you.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.581
- Yeah. We have the reservations.
- Yes!

04:52.333 --> 04:54.334
All right, buddy! Way to go!

04:57.005 --> 04:58.380
Dude, what are you doing?

04:59.007 --> 05:03.427
Thank you. My boss keeps slapping my
butt and acting like it's no big deal.

05:03.636 --> 05:05.178
What'd you do about it?

05:05.388 --> 05:08.140
I didn't do anything.
I didn't want to be the guy...

05:08.391 --> 05:11.226
...who has a problem with his boss
slapping his bottom.

05:12.103 --> 05:15.397
I gotta tell you, I think it's okay
to be that guy.

05:16.441 --> 05:17.899
Maybe it's that jock thing.

05:18.109 --> 05:21.862
You know, how football players
pat each other after touchdowns.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.283
You know, I don't understand guys.

05:26.534 --> 05:29.995
I mean, I would never congratulate
Monica on a great stew...

05:30.204 --> 05:32.456
...by, you know, grabbing her boob.

05:34.250 --> 05:36.501
I know. For a really great stew,
you'd just...

05:36.753 --> 05:38.545
...stick your head in between them.

05:40.256 --> 05:41.673
Can we please go eat?

05:41.924 --> 05:45.010
- Yeah, what are we getting?
- Anything but stew.

05:46.012 --> 05:49.514
So from now on, don't give
your boss a chance to get you.

05:49.766 --> 05:51.475
Don't turn your back to him.

05:52.101 --> 05:54.644
Or you could teach him
a lesson, you know?

05:54.896 --> 05:59.483
What you do is rub something that
smells really bad on your butt, right?

05:59.692 --> 06:03.070
Then when he goes to smack you,
his hand will smell.

06:05.907 --> 06:09.493
Now, what could you rub on your butt
that would smell bad?

06:12.497 --> 06:14.498
What if Joey was President?

06:17.919 --> 06:19.294
Can I ask you something?

06:19.545 --> 06:21.755
- Yeah.
- Okay, you can totally say no...

06:21.964 --> 06:26.009
...but would it be okay with you
if I set Ross up on a date?

06:26.427 --> 06:29.096
Oh. Uh, with who?

06:29.347 --> 06:32.182
My friend Bonnie.
She always thought Ross was cute...

06:32.433 --> 06:35.060
...and she asked if I could set it up.

06:35.269 --> 06:37.979
- But if that's not cool...
- Which one is Bonnie?

06:38.231 --> 06:40.690
You remember her from
my birthday party?

06:40.942 --> 06:43.068
Average height...

06:43.319 --> 06:45.529
...medium build, bald...

06:45.988 --> 06:47.322
Oh!

06:49.409 --> 06:50.826
That's fine.

06:51.452 --> 06:54.663
Great! Okay! Good for you!
All right!

07:00.294 --> 07:03.130
You are iron! You are steel!

07:03.840 --> 07:07.384
Let me ask you, how come when I call
your computer support line...

07:07.593 --> 07:09.678
...I have to wait an hour and a half?

07:09.929 --> 07:13.432
We're adding operators all the time.
Could we concentrate on my training?

07:13.641 --> 07:17.060
It's just hard when I know
I have e-mail I can't get.

07:19.981 --> 07:21.815
- Hi.
- Monica!

07:23.025 --> 07:24.067
Hi, honey.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.445
On the table. On the table, please.

07:28.364 --> 07:33.243
Hey, um, so listen, my friends were
telling me a little bit about...

07:33.453 --> 07:35.245
...this Ultimate Fighting thing.

07:35.496 --> 07:37.456
It sounds really dangerous.

07:37.707 --> 07:40.792
I don't want you to get hurt,
because I kind of like you.

07:41.002 --> 07:44.421
I don't want to get hurt either.
I'm being smart about this.

07:44.672 --> 07:47.674
See these guys? They're
the best trainers in the world.

07:47.925 --> 07:49.801
Hoshi was a paid assassin.

07:51.554 --> 07:54.139
A housepainter!
He used to be a housepainter!

07:56.684 --> 07:59.519
- Promise me you'll be careful.
- I promise.

07:59.729 --> 08:02.731
Are we still on for tonight?
Good. Because...

08:02.940 --> 08:05.275
...maybe we could have
a little workout of our own.

08:05.443 --> 08:07.652
No! No boom-boom before big fight!

08:12.658 --> 08:13.992
How about just a boom?

08:18.664 --> 08:20.999
That was depressing.
I just bought a pretzel...

08:21.209 --> 08:23.293
...from one of the kids from Fame.

08:24.170 --> 08:27.214
- Ready to go to the movies?
- Mm-hm. Oh, this is Bonnie!

08:27.423 --> 08:28.507
Hi.

08:29.509 --> 08:30.675
This is Bonnie?

08:30.927 --> 08:32.885
This is Bonnie? You're Bonnie?

08:33.095 --> 08:36.014
I can show you an I.D. If you want.

08:36.224 --> 08:40.268
Oh, no. You look a lot different
than the last time I saw you.

08:40.520 --> 08:43.395
Oh, yeah. Well, I just
started wearing bras again.

08:44.190 --> 08:45.941
Oh, that must be it.

08:47.485 --> 08:48.735
Have fun tonight.

08:48.945 --> 08:50.153
Thanks. You too.

08:56.911 --> 08:58.161
You said she was bald.

08:58.412 --> 09:00.205
She was bald. She's not now.

09:02.291 --> 09:04.167
How could you not tell me
she has hair?

09:04.418 --> 09:07.295
I don't know.
I hardly ever say that about people.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.381
Oh, well this is just perfect!

09:10.049 --> 09:13.009
Well, I'm sorry.
I thought you said it was okay.

09:13.261 --> 09:17.722
I said it was okay when I thought
she was some weird bald chick.

09:17.932 --> 09:20.475
That girl has got hair
all over her head!

09:22.937 --> 09:27.107
- Maybe Ross won't like her personality.
- Does she have a bad personality?

09:27.316 --> 09:29.401
Oh, no, Bonnie's the best!

09:35.116 --> 09:36.658
Bing!

09:38.160 --> 09:41.079
Read your CompuTek proposal.
Real home run.

09:41.247 --> 09:45.292
Ooh. Barely got you that time.
Get over here!

09:46.002 --> 09:47.002
Come on.

09:47.628 --> 09:49.212
Oh, yeah! Good one.

09:49.463 --> 09:52.007
That was a good one.
Keep at it, team!

09:53.593 --> 09:55.302
- What is with him?
- "With him"?

09:55.553 --> 09:57.971
You're his favorite.
You're his guy!

09:58.180 --> 09:59.598
We never get smacked.

10:01.183 --> 10:03.268
That's not true.
He smacked you once.

10:03.519 --> 10:06.646
Not on purpose.
He ricocheted off you and got me.

10:06.981 --> 10:09.983
I'm telling you,
I need some smacks.

10:10.568 --> 10:12.485
I got a kid starting Dartmouth.

10:12.737 --> 10:15.488
Dartmouth? Who went to Dartmouth?
Dartmouth sucks!

10:15.698 --> 10:17.198
- You go to Dartmouth?
- No, sir.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.784
There you go! Ha-ha-ha.

10:26.292 --> 10:27.334
Hey.

10:27.501 --> 10:29.044
God, Ross! What is that?

10:29.295 --> 10:30.920
The Ultimate Fighting Combo.

10:31.130 --> 10:34.215
I saved 30 cents.
Plus I get to keep the cup. Yay!

10:36.552 --> 10:38.887
From New York City, New York...

10:39.138 --> 10:43.266
...appearing in his Ultimate
Fighting Championship debut...

10:43.517 --> 10:47.270
...he's known for his
confrontational business style!

10:48.439 --> 10:51.900
Ladies and gentlemen, introducing...

10:52.109 --> 10:54.611
...Pete Becker!

11:00.242 --> 11:01.660
I love you, Pete!

11:05.748 --> 11:09.793
And his opponent
from Huntington Beach, California...

11:10.044 --> 11:13.797
...he's a 300-pound
street fighter...

11:14.298 --> 11:16.716
...Tank Abbott!

11:19.553 --> 11:21.304
Boo! Boo!

11:29.563 --> 11:31.481
Pete? Pete?

11:31.857 --> 11:34.109
- That guy's pretty huge.
- Don't worry.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.820
I'll use his strength
and weight against him.

11:37.071 --> 11:41.324
Well, then that guy is in serious,
serious trouble.

11:46.414 --> 11:48.206
You go get him. Let's go!

11:49.542 --> 11:51.251
Here we go, gentlemen.

11:51.502 --> 11:52.836
Are you ready?

11:55.965 --> 11:58.508
Are you ready?
Then let's get it on!

12:05.433 --> 12:06.558
Uh-oh!

12:18.320 --> 12:19.738
Hey.

12:20.656 --> 12:21.823
It's me.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.451
Monica.

12:27.246 --> 12:29.831
Can I just tell you how proud
I am of you?

12:30.082 --> 12:34.085
It would be nice after hearing
20,000 people chant, "You suck!"

12:35.296 --> 12:37.297
I thought you were nuts at first...

12:37.548 --> 12:39.090
...but you did it.

12:39.467 --> 12:42.510
Now you can just look back at this
with no regrets.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.179
Look back?

12:44.972 --> 12:46.848
You're not gonna keep going?

12:47.183 --> 12:50.935
Let me ask you a question:
Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion?

12:53.022 --> 12:54.689
Well, no. But...

12:54.982 --> 12:58.276
I'm not gonna stop until I'm
the Ultimate Fighting Champion.

12:59.361 --> 13:03.156
That guy stood on your neck
until you passed out.

13:03.949 --> 13:05.658
Let me tell you a story.

13:06.535 --> 13:10.872
When I set out to create MOSS 865,
do you think it happened overnight?

13:11.123 --> 13:15.543
No. There was MOSS 1
that burned down my dad's garage.

13:15.795 --> 13:19.714
There was MOSS 2 that would only
schedule appointments in January.

13:19.882 --> 13:22.217
And 862 others that I learned from.

13:22.510 --> 13:26.221
Just like I learned from this fight
never to let a guy stand on my neck.

13:26.514 --> 13:28.723
You didn't know that already?

13:30.226 --> 13:32.227
Look, I'm gonna get better.

13:33.103 --> 13:35.188
Okay? I promise you.

13:36.524 --> 13:37.565
Okay.

13:38.901 --> 13:41.236
Just get a lot better.

13:41.695 --> 13:43.071
Fast.

13:45.241 --> 13:46.324
One other thing.

13:46.575 --> 13:50.245
Hoshi thinks you being ringside
may have affected my concentration.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.247
Yeah.

13:52.540 --> 13:54.249
That was the problem.

14:00.881 --> 14:03.758
- How long until Pete's fight?
- About five minutes.

14:04.009 --> 14:05.718
They're interviewing his opponent.

14:05.928 --> 14:10.056
Apparently, he trains by going to Iran
and pulling the arms off thieves.

14:10.224 --> 14:13.601
- Wow. Ha, ha. Hot dog?
- Four, please.

14:14.186 --> 14:15.770
I'm really nervous.

14:16.730 --> 14:17.772
Thank you.

14:20.067 --> 14:23.194
So how did it go with Bonnie?

14:23.445 --> 14:27.615
Oh, I gotta tell you,
I wasn't expecting to like her at all.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.785
I actually wasn't expecting
to like anyone right now.

14:31.036 --> 14:33.079
But she's really terrific.

14:33.247 --> 14:34.289
It's too bad.

14:36.750 --> 14:39.168
No, I'm saying I liked her.

14:39.420 --> 14:41.296
There are other fish in the sea.

14:42.548 --> 14:45.800
I think she's great, okay?
We're going out again.

14:46.427 --> 14:49.637
I hear you. Are you capable
of talking about anything else?

14:51.473 --> 14:53.474
Which one's my turkey burger?

14:53.767 --> 14:55.977
The one next to my foot.
Sorry.

14:56.979 --> 14:59.230
- Fight's starting!
- We'll be right in.

14:59.440 --> 15:02.317
So did your boss try
to slap you again today?

15:02.484 --> 15:03.985
Nine times.

15:04.820 --> 15:06.446
I had to put on lotion.

15:08.616 --> 15:11.492
But it'll be okay.
Tomorrow, I conduct an experiment.

15:11.785 --> 15:15.747
And if all goes as planned,
my butt will be smack-free.

15:16.457 --> 15:17.624
Fight's over!

15:23.213 --> 15:24.672
Excuse me, Doug?

15:27.092 --> 15:29.135
Hey there, sports fan!

15:29.511 --> 15:31.971
Bing! You got those numbers for me?

15:32.181 --> 15:34.098
No. I didn't do them.

15:34.350 --> 15:36.225
Oh. You forgot?

15:36.477 --> 15:38.937
No, I just didn't do them.

15:39.188 --> 15:42.857
Instead, I hung out with some
friends and had a couple of beers.

15:43.150 --> 15:45.818
So I certainly don't
deserve praise. Verbal...

15:46.028 --> 15:47.654
...or otherwise.

15:48.280 --> 15:51.366
I got tanked myself last night.
Pretty dicey drive home.

15:51.617 --> 15:54.035
Tappan Zee Bridge never looked smaller.
Ha, ha.

15:55.120 --> 15:58.289
That's okay. You're still
my number one guy! Bing!

15:58.874 --> 16:01.125
- Doug!
- Hmm?

16:01.293 --> 16:05.838
I'm a little bit uncomfortable with
the way that you express yourself.

16:06.048 --> 16:08.633
Is it the swearing?
Is it the constant swearing?

16:08.842 --> 16:12.845
Because I gotta tell you, if it is,
you can just kiss my ass!

16:14.890 --> 16:17.642
No. It's not about the swearing.
It's more about...

16:17.893 --> 16:20.353
...the way that you occasionally...

16:20.562 --> 16:24.065
...concentrate your enthusiasm...

16:25.359 --> 16:26.901
...on my buttocks.

16:28.278 --> 16:29.320
Oh.

16:29.488 --> 16:32.281
Don't get me wrong,
I appreciate the sentiment.

16:32.491 --> 16:36.327
It's just that I have a rather
sensitive posterior.

16:38.163 --> 16:41.416
And besides, it's making
all the other guys jealous.

16:41.667 --> 16:45.670
Well, say no more. You know,
it takes guts to bring this up.

16:45.921 --> 16:47.880
Bing, you're okay.

16:48.048 --> 16:49.090
Okay.

16:49.258 --> 16:51.509
- Ha! Ah!
- Ah!

16:58.100 --> 17:01.728
Would you rather live in the
shirt pocket of a sweaty giant...

17:01.937 --> 17:04.439
...or inside his shower drain?

17:06.442 --> 17:07.733
Oh, my God.

17:08.318 --> 17:10.361
Look. It's Ross and that girl.

17:13.699 --> 17:18.202
Look at that! It's a line of ants!
They're working as a team!

17:20.204 --> 17:24.333
Right. Oh, yeah. It looks
like Ross is breaking up with her.

17:24.585 --> 17:26.044
I hope he lets her down easy.

17:26.295 --> 17:29.255
Look at that! They are not
breaking up! Look at them!

17:29.465 --> 17:32.467
You know what that is?
A second date, that's what that is.

17:33.135 --> 17:35.470
Look, she just put her hand
on his thigh.

17:35.721 --> 17:38.306
That's nothing.
She's very sexually aggressive.

17:38.474 --> 17:39.599
Oh, God!

17:39.850 --> 17:44.645
It's your fault. Now he loves her.
He'll marry her. It's all your fault.

17:45.355 --> 17:46.856
You said it was okay.

17:47.107 --> 17:49.233
You said she was bald!

17:50.652 --> 17:52.987
Was! Was, was, was!

17:54.323 --> 17:58.326
We can't let it happen. We have to do
something. We have to break them up.

17:58.577 --> 18:02.789
Just go in there and shave her head!
You owe me one bald girl!

18:04.625 --> 18:06.417
Okay, first of all, breathe.

18:07.669 --> 18:10.004
Second of all, I don't get it.

18:10.380 --> 18:13.466
Aren't you the one that decided
you didn't want to be with Ross?

18:15.594 --> 18:16.677
Yes.

18:16.929 --> 18:20.640
Well, isn't he your friend?
Don't you want him to be happy?

18:23.018 --> 18:24.018
Yes.

18:24.853 --> 18:26.020
So?

18:30.275 --> 18:34.779
It's just, you know, I didn't
expect him to be this happy so soon.

18:44.456 --> 18:45.498
- Oh, no.
- What?

18:45.707 --> 18:46.833
We killed them all!

19:03.058 --> 19:05.935
It's not as bad as it looks.
It's a precaution.

19:06.186 --> 19:08.688
I'm not supposed to move my spine.

19:11.191 --> 19:13.067
Please tell me you're stopping now.

19:13.443 --> 19:16.195
I'm fine. I'd fight tonight
if they'd let me.

19:17.865 --> 19:20.491
Now, see this circle
I'm marking off here?

19:20.701 --> 19:22.702
This is my Zone of Terror.

19:25.455 --> 19:28.833
You are insane!
You've got to give this up!

19:29.042 --> 19:31.961
I can't until I'm
the Ultimate Fighter.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.337
I will do it.

19:33.589 --> 19:37.842
The day will come when children will
argue over who will win a fight...

19:38.093 --> 19:40.011
...me or Superman.

19:41.889 --> 19:44.891
Not that I could beat Superman,
but kids are stupid.

19:46.101 --> 19:47.393
Just sit down.

19:47.603 --> 19:49.478
Please listen to me.

19:49.688 --> 19:54.692
You are terrible at this, okay? You
are the worst Ultimate Fighter ever.

19:55.110 --> 19:56.110
Ever!

19:57.571 --> 20:01.616
I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline
fracture in my right forearm...

20:01.867 --> 20:05.995
...and a severely bruised Adam's
apple, but that really hurt.

20:11.627 --> 20:13.878
Well, then you know what?

20:15.923 --> 20:20.092
I care about you too much to watch you
hurt yourself like this.

20:20.594 --> 20:24.013
So if you have to do this,
you'll have to do it without me.

20:24.514 --> 20:26.432
If you're asking me to quit...

20:26.642 --> 20:29.518
...then you're asking me
to be someone I'm not.

20:29.811 --> 20:31.270
I've got to do this.

20:35.609 --> 20:37.443
Then I've gotta go.

20:39.196 --> 20:40.238
Bye.

20:46.036 --> 20:47.828
- Monica?
- Yes?

20:48.580 --> 20:50.665
Could you leave a note?
I'm on painkillers...

20:50.958 --> 20:53.084
...and I might not
remember this tomorrow.

20:58.548 --> 21:03.552
So, in conclusion, the lines
all go up, so I'm happy.

21:04.429 --> 21:06.764
Great job, team!
Tomorrow at 8:30.

21:07.349 --> 21:10.434
Phil, nice job! Stevens, way to go!

21:10.644 --> 21:12.853
Goldberg, you maniac!

21:13.105 --> 21:14.689
I love you!

21:17.109 --> 21:20.695
- Bing, couldn't have done it without you.
- Thank you, sir.

21:20.988 --> 21:22.280
Oh, excuse me.

21:22.489 --> 21:26.200
I forgot my briefcase, you know,
by accident.

21:26.493 --> 21:28.661
Of course you did. Forgot
something else too, you bastard!

21:32.749 --> 21:34.792
Well, what about you?

21:35.043 --> 21:37.545
You're not feeling left out, are you?

21:37.713 --> 21:38.713
No. Heh.

21:38.880 --> 21:41.465
No, not at all. That's ridiculous.

21:41.675 --> 21:44.885
Everybody else got one,
and you want one too. Don't you?

21:48.223 --> 21:49.557
- Yes, I do.
- Ha-ha-ha.

21:49.850 --> 21:51.976
Now, get on out of here, you!

21:57.065 --> 21:58.816
Pete Becker circles the ring.

21:59.067 --> 22:01.527
Looks like he's just trying
to feel him out.

22:01.737 --> 22:03.237
Bruiser is charging!

22:03.488 --> 22:06.157
Run, you crazy, rich freak!

22:07.826 --> 22:09.076
I can't watch this.

22:09.369 --> 22:10.995
Check it out! Pete's winning!

22:11.246 --> 22:13.247
- Really?
- No!

22:15.751 --> 22:20.171
Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on
the canvas and is going for his favorite area!

22:20.422 --> 22:21.672
Oh! Oh!

22:21.965 --> 22:25.926
Wait! If that's his favorite area,
why is he being so mean to it?

22:26.595 --> 22:27.845
This is ironic.

22:28.096 --> 22:30.765
Your last boyfriend, Richard,
didn't want to have kids.

22:31.016 --> 22:33.601
And from the looks of it,
now Pete can't.
