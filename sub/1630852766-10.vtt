that smile on.

give him a hug.

11:59.619 --> 12:03.488
He never mentioned it.
He--he--he...

12:03.590 --> 12:09.260
The only explanation is that
he was hiding it from me

12:09.362 --> 12:13.431
to make me doubt
that it happened maybe,

12:13.533 --> 12:17.502

he's hovering over girls

everybody's breasts.

we were going to go
for a little walk.

13:06.520 --> 13:10.789
He took me down the hall,
and he got a key out,

it was a skeleton key.

He opened the door
on a girl who was sleeping,

13:32.679 --> 13:36.147

13:36.249 --> 13:38.416

and I-I had reason
to believe that was true.

37:08.093 --> 37:11.595
Even then, I didn't believe that
he would destroy all of them.

37:11.697 --> 37:15.732
He just--his ego would not
destroy all the tapes.

37:17.135 --> 37:18.702
No, no.

37:18.804 --> 37:21.905
Even after all our letters,
there was no apology from him.

37:22.007 --> 37:23.673
You'd get a pat on the back.

37:23.775 --> 37:27.344
"don't worry.
It'll all be okay."

37:27.446 --> 37:30.614
but no, he didn't
apologize for anything.

37:30.716 --> 37:34.084
Hefner never wanted us
to be friends, right?

37:34.186 --> 37:35.986
-Yeah.
-And so then...

37:36.088 --> 37:37.254
Because you were crazy
and dangerous.

37:37.356 --> 37:38.655
-I was crazy and dangerous.
-Yeah.

37:38.757 --> 37:39.823
And now you've become crazy
and dangerous. [laughs]

37:39.925 --> 37:41.024
now we're both crazy
and dangerous.

37:41.126 --> 37:42.292
All right.

37:42.394 --> 37:47.097
Miki has been there for me
through so many things

37:47.199 --> 37:49.199
that I didn't have
the support of my family,

37:49.301 --> 37:52.435
I didn't have the encouragement.

37:52.537 --> 37:58.041
To find sondra
after so many years in 2011,

37:58.143 --> 38:01.611
it was like striking gold,
really. [laughs]

38:01.713 --> 38:03.613
all right.

38:05.350 --> 38:11.488
I didn't meet p.J. Until...
I think it was 2016.

38:11.590 --> 38:14.090
She asked me to partner
with her in this group

38:14.192 --> 38:18.328
that she started,
the iconic women of playboy.

38:18.430 --> 38:22.332
She supported sondra and I.
She put herself out on a limb,

38:22.434 --> 38:24.567
and this is a woman who survived

38:24.670 --> 38:28.171
a brutal rape by bill cosby,
hefner's best friend.

38:28.273 --> 38:30.240
So it's the bunny mother,

38:30.342 --> 38:32.375
the director
of playboy promotions,

38:32.477 --> 38:34.311
and the girlfriend of hefner's.

38:34.413 --> 38:36.513
It's the first time ever

38:36.615 --> 38:39.649
that all of these worlds
collided together.

38:39.751 --> 38:41.851
<i> -Hello?</i>
-Hi, miki. It's p.J.

38:41.953 --> 38:43.987
<i> Hi, p.J.</i>

38:44.089 --> 38:48.325
In the end, we're just damn
lucky we got out of there

38:48.427 --> 38:50.126
as normal as we could be...
[laughs]

38:50.228 --> 38:52.729
because not one of us
is normal. Not one of us.

38:52.831 --> 38:56.900
It may be too late
to do much about us,

38:57.002 --> 38:59.369
but that shouldn't stop us.

38:59.471 --> 39:02.572
I'm sure with this documentary,

39:02.674 --> 39:04.374
there's gonna be
a lot of women

39:04.476 --> 39:06.109
that have come out
of the woodwork with stories

39:06.211 --> 39:09.512
that we haven't heard about yet.

39:09.614 --> 39:14.351
I hope that by coming out
with this that maybe other girls

39:14.453 --> 39:16.619
can say, finally, you know,

39:16.722 --> 39:18.888
they acknowledge
that there was wrong

39:18.990 --> 39:20.523
and maybe they can let go
of that nightmare.

39:20.625 --> 39:23.226
I think women are getting
a bit smarter.

39:23.328 --> 39:26.463
I think they'll smell the rat.

39:26.565 --> 39:30.233
Now is the time.
We've got me too and time's up.

39:30.335 --> 39:31.501
For god's sakes,

39:31.603 --> 39:33.770
it's time for the playboy women
to come forward.

39:33.872 --> 39:38.108
It's amazing
that nobody ever talked

39:38.210 --> 39:39.876
among their selves about it.

39:39.978 --> 39:42.679
I think hef just knew
we wouldn't

39:42.781 --> 39:46.483
because we sort of
were suspicious of each other,

39:46.585 --> 39:48.451
but it's gotta be told.

39:48.553 --> 39:52.622
I can't really explain to you

39:52.724 --> 39:54.758
how strong the feeling was
in me

39:54.860 --> 39:56.359
that I needed
to get my story out,

39:56.461 --> 40:00.063
so I wouldn't feel bound
to be living this lie

40:00.165 --> 40:02.699
where I constantly have to
apologize for him

40:02.801 --> 40:05.235
or say he's great
or say things were great

40:05.337 --> 40:06.536
when I was there,
when they weren't.

40:06.638 --> 40:10.607
I don't have a problem
with speaking the truth.

40:10.709 --> 40:13.810
If people can't handle the
truth, I don't know what to say.

40:13.912 --> 40:17.881
Coming forward, I think
will be a cleansing for me.

40:17.983 --> 40:20.450
It's very difficult to think
of all my skeletons

40:20.552 --> 40:23.520
in everybody's living room
right now.

40:23.622 --> 40:26.256
Nobody wants to reveal
their secrets,

40:26.358 --> 40:28.391
but I wanted to make
a difference.

40:28.493 --> 40:30.593
It's got to make a difference.

40:30.695 --> 40:34.330
I'm hurt.

40:34.433 --> 40:36.766
And I can't be alone
in this pain.

40:36.868 --> 40:38.234
I know I'm not.

40:38.336 --> 40:41.738
There are too many of us,
and I want to write some of it.

40:41.840 --> 40:45.442
I want it to go away,
and eventually, maybe it will.

40:45.544 --> 40:48.244
If enough women
tell me that it helped,

40:48.346 --> 40:49.979
maybe it will go away.

40:50.081 --> 40:53.116
♪♪♪

40:53.218 --> 40:56.619
every man in the world would
say, "I want to be hugh hefner."

40:56.721 --> 41:00.223
they thought he had
the good life.

41:00.325 --> 41:08.097
Hefner was a sexual predator
that didn't care who he damaged.

41:08.200 --> 41:12.802
It was all about his power
and his prestige.

41:12.904 --> 41:16.339
We pulled the curtain back,
wizard.

41:16.441 --> 41:19.943
We know who you are.
We know who you were.
