01:07.592 --> 01:09.071
Meg.

01:09.072 --> 01:10.592
Meg.

01:17.811 --> 01:19.130
Sir.

01:19.131 --> 01:21.131
Your phone was off.

01:23.531 --> 01:25.091
Are you OK, sir?

02:59.371 --> 03:02.490
We've interviewed the two divers
who discovered the body, sir.

03:02.491 --> 03:06.370
They're amateurs. They were just
out for a bit of fun apparently.

03:06.371 --> 03:10.650
According to the doctor, the body's
been down there weeks... months.

03:10.651 --> 03:13.451
ID? Young male,
naked apart from his underwear.

03:15.211 --> 03:16.930
The divers.

03:16.931 --> 03:18.731
They broke in just before dawn.

03:22.371 --> 03:25.610
They found the body ten metres down.
It was tied to something.

03:25.611 --> 03:28.851
One of them caught it with
his flipper and it broke away. Sir.

03:30.651 --> 03:33.690
Find out what was holding him down.
And search the whole area.

03:33.691 --> 03:36.091
We're looking for anything
that can give us a name.

03:38.771 --> 03:40.570
Who owns this place?

03:40.571 --> 03:43.210
Tommy James, local businessman.

03:43.211 --> 03:45.490
Runs a haulage company
up in Penwyllt.

03:45.491 --> 03:48.011
Penwyllt? I'll take you there.

04:25.011 --> 04:26.451
Mr James?

04:28.331 --> 04:31.450
DI Rhys. DCI Mathias.

04:31.451 --> 04:33.491
We'd like to talk to you.

04:36.571 --> 04:39.210
When did the quarry close?
20 years ago.

04:39.211 --> 04:41.530
What did it produce? Stone.

04:41.531 --> 04:43.971
Why did it shut?
It was worked-out.

04:46.571 --> 04:48.530
And when were you last there?

04:48.531 --> 04:51.090
Don't remember. Ages ago. Why?

04:51.091 --> 04:53.531
Two men broke in there
earlier today.

04:54.651 --> 04:56.210
They found a body.

04:56.211 --> 04:58.410
Any idea who it might be?

04:58.411 --> 04:59.771
No idea, sorry.

05:00.891 --> 05:03.690
You said that the quarry hadn't been
worked for 20 years

05:03.691 --> 05:06.490
so it couldn't have been someone
who was working there.

05:06.491 --> 05:09.050
There was no security guard?
Or caretaker?

05:09.051 --> 05:12.571
Why should I pay someone to guard
a worked-out quarry?
Fencing's cheaper.

05:17.931 --> 05:19.851
I've got a licence for that.

05:21.731 --> 05:25.370
Do you still keep records
of your employees? Somewhere.

05:25.371 --> 05:27.211
I'd like to see them.

05:50.611 --> 05:53.330
Me and the boys,
we drive up the mountain in this,

05:53.331 --> 05:56.370
wait in the dark for a bit,
then turn on the lights. And?

05:56.371 --> 05:58.291
Shoot anything that moves.

06:01.051 --> 06:02.691
Only rabbits.

06:06.131 --> 06:07.970
You know these people?

06:07.971 --> 06:10.811
Grew up around them
helping Dad with his rounds.

06:18.251 --> 06:21.091
Hello. Is your mammy in?

06:22.211 --> 06:24.050
Mammy!

06:24.051 --> 06:25.971
Mammy!

06:27.571 --> 06:29.530
They shouldn't have been in there.

06:29.531 --> 06:33.571
Doesn't matter how many signs you
put up, people think they can go
wherever they like.

06:35.011 --> 06:36.931
And we'll need those back, please.

06:38.331 --> 06:40.490
What did he look like?

06:40.491 --> 06:42.131
The dead body?

06:55.171 --> 06:56.810
Defi isn't like other children.

06:56.811 --> 06:59.090
He sees the world
in a different way.

06:59.091 --> 07:02.410
We're trying to keep the worst
of life away from him for now.

07:02.411 --> 07:04.131
It'll get to him soon enough.

07:05.051 --> 07:07.410
Do you have any idea who the
dead man might be?

07:07.411 --> 07:09.251
Excuse me.

07:10.811 --> 07:12.371
DI Rhys.

07:26.011 --> 07:28.090
I like your drawings, Defi.

07:28.091 --> 07:30.330
You ever seen an owl?

07:30.331 --> 07:34.530
The pathologists estimates death
between two and three months ago.

07:34.531 --> 07:36.891
Which would make it late
January...

07:38.251 --> 07:40.250
..February.

07:40.251 --> 07:41.731
Twit-twoo.

07:44.051 --> 07:45.691
Twit-twoo.

08:10.211 --> 08:12.650
I've been expecting you. Have you?

08:12.651 --> 08:14.690
What about?

08:14.691 --> 08:16.530
The body in the quarry.

08:16.531 --> 08:19.731
How do you know about that, Mr..?
Morgan. Gwilym.

08:20.971 --> 08:22.691
Small place, news travels fast.

08:23.931 --> 08:26.570
He'd been in the water
for two to three months.

08:26.571 --> 08:29.291
Someone from these parts?
You tell me.

08:30.331 --> 08:34.250
Well, I'd say no. Why's that?
Because I would have heard.

08:34.251 --> 08:37.450
Do you have any idea who the
dead man could be?

08:37.451 --> 08:39.010
No.

08:56.491 --> 08:59.770
We must establish who this man was
as soon as possible.

08:59.771 --> 09:03.010
We don't have a name yet
but we're hoping with your help

09:03.011 --> 09:04.810
we can find out who it is.

09:04.811 --> 09:08.970
Anything you say will, of course, be
treated with the utmost confidence.

09:08.971 --> 09:12.050
But if you have any information,
any ideas,

09:12.051 --> 09:14.130
anything at all that might help,

09:14.131 --> 09:16.570
please let us know.

09:16.571 --> 09:18.131
Thank you for your time.

09:50.571 --> 09:53.090
'Goodyear 18.4R38.'

09:53.091 --> 09:54.490
Bog-standard tractor tyre.

09:54.491 --> 09:57.130
Well-worn, no markings apart
from the manufacturer's.

09:57.131 --> 10:00.450
Any human contact traces
soaked off weeks ago.

10:00.451 --> 10:02.890
And this was holding him down?
Yes, sir.

10:02.891 --> 10:05.210
Just tied to him
with blue, plastic rope.

10:05.211 --> 10:08.850
Standard, 16 mill,
three strand polypropylene.

10:08.851 --> 10:11.970
A sample of his DNA
has gone off for matching.

10:11.971 --> 10:16.010
We're also checking dental records,
missing persons, hospitals,
homeless charities.

10:16.011 --> 10:19.930
No name, no age. How did he get
into the water and why?

10:19.931 --> 10:22.650
Suicide? It's a possibility.

10:22.651 --> 10:25.250
Any sign of his clothing? No.

10:25.251 --> 10:27.251
Why keep his pants on?

10:28.211 --> 10:29.290
Dignity.

10:29.291 --> 10:31.610
So he makes his way
to the quarry naked,

10:31.611 --> 10:35.490
apart from his underpants and
he's what? Carrying this tyre?

10:35.491 --> 10:37.370
Too heavy.

10:37.371 --> 10:39.291
Rolling it along in front of him?

10:40.811 --> 10:42.531
This was no suicide.

10:43.691 --> 10:47.170
This man was stripped naked, near as
dammit, and thrown into the quarry

10:47.171 --> 10:49.610
tied to a tractor tyre to
make sure that he stayed there.

10:49.611 --> 10:51.931
Murder? Yes, Lloyd!

10:53.131 --> 10:54.810
Murder.

10:54.811 --> 10:57.691
Come on, Mared,
we're going back to the quarry.

11:18.771 --> 11:20.730
Sir...

11:20.731 --> 11:22.971
Just spoken to pathology.

11:25.811 --> 11:28.490
Dental examination put
the victim in his early 20s.

11:28.491 --> 11:30.450
Bruising to the face
and marks on the body

11:30.451 --> 11:33.130
suggests he was beaten
and his finger nails were worn away.

11:33.131 --> 11:36.490
He was trapped in a confined space.
Cause of death confirmed
as drowning.

11:36.491 --> 11:39.770
But they tested the water in his
lungs against the water of the
quarry. And?

11:39.771 --> 11:41.291
It doesn't match.

11:43.091 --> 11:44.731
He drowned somewhere else.

11:52.931 --> 11:55.490
The pathology report says
the water in his lungs

11:55.491 --> 11:58.970
shows high levels of peat
and animal waste. Animal?

11:58.971 --> 12:00.490
What sort of animal?

12:00.491 --> 12:03.850
The water the victim drowned in
contained significant quantities

12:03.851 --> 12:06.051
of sheep's urine and faeces.

12:07.291 --> 12:09.411
Well, there's plenty of that
up here.

12:19.051 --> 12:21.210
I thought you ran the pub?

12:21.211 --> 12:23.131
I do. I also do this.

12:24.811 --> 12:27.450
Some of the fencing at the quarry
looks new.

12:27.451 --> 12:29.091
Who did the work? Me.

12:30.411 --> 12:33.530
When was that?
A month ago thereabouts.

12:33.531 --> 12:35.411
A disused quarry? Why?

12:37.011 --> 12:41.051
Disused but still dangerous.
Tommy knows his responsibilities.

12:43.051 --> 12:44.851
You two are close friends.

12:45.891 --> 12:47.771
I saw some photos in his office.

12:48.931 --> 12:51.051
We grew up together.

12:52.811 --> 12:56.450
We still don't have a name
for the dead man. Any ideas?

12:56.451 --> 12:58.051
No.

12:59.091 --> 13:02.611
It's good of Mr James to give you
the job at the quarry.

13:03.771 --> 13:05.531
It's what friends do, isn't it?

13:51.811 --> 13:54.530
My husband's not in,
if that's who you're after?

13:54.531 --> 13:58.690
I've already spoken to him.
Second job, is it? Fencing?

13:58.691 --> 14:00.850
Yes. And just as well.

14:00.851 --> 14:03.090
Business bad, then?

14:03.091 --> 14:05.771
Quiet in the week,
bit better at weekends.

14:06.851 --> 14:08.930
Lots of postcards.

14:08.931 --> 14:11.691
Help cheer the place up.
Who are they from?

14:13.171 --> 14:16.250
Customers and some of the people
we get stopping here.

14:16.251 --> 14:18.251
Got a room upstairs. Do B&B.

14:19.251 --> 14:22.050
Get all sorts here.
Loggers, shearers.

14:22.051 --> 14:23.850
Some of them stay in touch.

14:23.851 --> 14:25.650
Can you give me any names?

14:25.651 --> 14:28.210
Do you think one of them
might be him in the quarry?

14:28.211 --> 14:29.650
It's possible.

14:29.651 --> 14:31.451
Names?

14:32.531 --> 14:34.291
I'll do my best.

14:37.611 --> 14:39.051
You lost?

14:42.691 --> 14:44.411
No, not lost, just...

14:45.451 --> 14:48.690
I'm just trying to work out how
a drowned man's lungs got to be

14:48.691 --> 14:52.130
full of water containing
sheep shit and piss.

14:52.131 --> 14:54.330
He could have fallen into a sump.

14:54.331 --> 14:56.690
You wouldn't want to
fall into one of them.

14:56.691 --> 15:00.130
What about the pens?
That's where we sort the sheep out.

15:00.131 --> 15:03.291
Can't see how your man would end up
drowning in there, mind.

15:07.091 --> 15:08.531
Thanks.

15:58.411 --> 16:01.011
This one's Dean Hudson. Shearer.

16:02.651 --> 16:05.290
Worked here for the
last three seasons.

16:05.291 --> 16:06.890
Any address?

16:06.891 --> 16:09.811
Lives in New Zealand. Sorry.
What about this one?

16:12.611 --> 16:14.970
Shelley. Agricultural student.

16:14.971 --> 16:16.731
Girl.

16:18.371 --> 16:19.971
This one?

16:27.331 --> 16:30.130
"Hope you're well.
Life moves on. M."

16:30.131 --> 16:32.131
M?

16:33.331 --> 16:36.131
I can't remember. Matthew? Martin?

16:37.171 --> 16:39.011
Might have been Matthew.

19:06.971 --> 19:09.090
Put it down!

19:09.091 --> 19:10.691
Put it down, I said!

19:12.651 --> 19:14.251
Now!

19:21.731 --> 19:23.370
You tried to kill me.

19:23.371 --> 19:26.210
I thought you were... Who?

19:26.211 --> 19:28.451
You shouldn't be here, it's private.

19:30.691 --> 19:33.451
I was following a man that sells
tyres in Penwyllt.

19:34.531 --> 19:37.810
Gwilym Morgan. You know him?
Well, I've seen him about.

19:37.811 --> 19:40.930
Wasn't he up here to see you?
I don't see anyone Why not?

19:40.931 --> 19:42.411
I just don't.

19:50.011 --> 19:51.611
What's your name?

19:53.571 --> 19:56.131
Wyn. Wyn Bratton.

19:59.211 --> 20:01.570
Were you up here in January, Wyn?

20:01.571 --> 20:03.530
I live up here, why?

20:03.531 --> 20:05.811
We found a body in the quarry
yesterday.

20:07.851 --> 20:09.651
I'm trying to find out who it is.

20:13.131 --> 20:15.010
Well, I can't help you.

20:15.011 --> 20:17.810
Well, you must know every inch
of this forest.

20:17.811 --> 20:19.651
What and who moves in and out.

20:21.571 --> 20:23.730
I just get on with my job.

20:23.731 --> 20:27.531
Nature's simple, people complicate
things. Is that why you live here?

20:29.251 --> 20:32.531
Yeah. In a caravan?
Suits me.

20:33.571 --> 20:37.210
Bed, roof, something to cook on.

20:37.211 --> 20:39.330
For how long?

20:39.331 --> 20:40.891
Four years.

20:43.211 --> 20:46.330
Lonely life.
Only if you need company. Don't you?

20:46.331 --> 20:48.131
Have you finished? Not yet, no.

20:55.891 --> 20:57.290
Lloyd?

20:57.291 --> 20:59.171
We've got a match on the DNA, sir.

21:00.771 --> 21:03.411
His name's Michael Reynolds. Thanks.

21:04.651 --> 21:07.210
Did you phone just now? Yes. Why?

21:07.211 --> 21:08.771
No reason just...

21:15.171 --> 21:17.250
The dead man has a name.

21:17.251 --> 21:19.771
Michael Reynolds.
Does that mean anything to you?

21:45.051 --> 21:48.170
Michael Reynolds was 24
and originally from Abercrave.

21:48.171 --> 21:51.410
He taught science in a comp
near Swansea, Ynysuchaf School,

21:51.411 --> 21:52.970
until January.

21:52.971 --> 21:55.371
Middle of the afternoon
on Thursday 7th...

21:59.411 --> 22:02.410
..he suddenly stops speaking
and walks out of his classroom.

22:02.411 --> 22:05.170
Then he goes home,
packs a few things and leaves.

22:05.171 --> 22:09.210
Any problems at the school?
No, the headmistress couldn't speak
highly enough of him.

22:09.211 --> 22:11.570
She said the kids loved him, too.
He was a natural.

22:11.571 --> 22:13.131
So why did he walk?

22:14.891 --> 22:17.490
His parents were killed
in a car crash a few months before.

22:17.491 --> 22:21.650
The head thinks he'd bottled up his
grief to the point where he simply
couldn't take any more.

22:21.651 --> 22:23.211
He left these things at the school.

22:42.411 --> 22:44.090
It's a St Christopher, sir.

22:44.091 --> 22:47.330
His housemates say it was
a present from his parents.

22:47.331 --> 22:49.090
Always wore it.

22:49.091 --> 22:50.850
It wasn't on the body.

22:50.851 --> 22:53.010
So he leaves the house,

22:53.011 --> 22:55.890
calls a cab, spends a night
in a hotel in Swansea.

22:55.891 --> 22:57.730
The next day, January 8th,

22:57.731 --> 23:00.330
he goes to a garage and buys
a VW Camper Van.

23:00.331 --> 23:03.410
Plate number E730 FLR.

23:03.411 --> 23:06.650
He pays in cash and insists
on taking it immediately.

23:06.651 --> 23:09.690
He arranges insurance
on the spot by phone, by card.

23:09.691 --> 23:12.210
That's the last time
the credit card was used.

23:12.211 --> 23:15.050
That's the last time anyone saw him.
Where's the camper van now?

23:15.051 --> 23:17.930
We're checking traffic cams,
all available CCTV.

23:17.931 --> 23:21.011
Details have been circulated
to all regional forces.

23:22.091 --> 23:24.290
Get this photocopied and circulated

23:24.291 --> 23:26.891
and run a check on a Wyn Bratton
for me, please.

23:48.491 --> 23:50.050
DI Rhys.

23:50.051 --> 23:52.330
Meet me at Gwilym's
garage in 15 minutes.

23:52.331 --> 23:53.651
Yes, sir.

24:20.371 --> 24:22.530
He broke down on the forest road.

24:22.531 --> 24:25.130
Tommy found him and brought
the camper van down here

24:25.131 --> 24:27.130
with the pick-up truck.
When was that?

24:27.131 --> 24:30.850
January, early part.
What was wrong with the camper van?

24:30.851 --> 24:34.210
Clapped out. I agreed to repair it.
I'm a qualified mechanic.

24:34.211 --> 24:36.290
I love those old camper vans.

24:36.291 --> 24:38.170
The freedom to move
whenever you want.

24:38.171 --> 24:40.650
You feel the need to move,
do you, Mr Morgan?

24:40.651 --> 24:43.491
No, no just...

24:45.211 --> 24:50.010
Anyway, it took a few weeks,
waiting for parts and that, you know.

24:50.011 --> 24:51.931
Where did he live in the meantime?

24:52.931 --> 24:55.570
Did he live with you?

24:55.571 --> 24:57.290
No.

24:57.291 --> 24:59.931
He lived with Dic and Lowri
at the pub.

25:00.971 --> 25:03.090
When did you last see him?

25:03.091 --> 25:05.131
When he drove off. End of February.

25:06.131 --> 25:10.010
There's a lot of Dic and Tommy.
None of you.

25:10.011 --> 25:12.331
Well, I took 'em, didn't I?

25:15.211 --> 25:18.370
I saw you yesterday by the forest.
Where were you going?

25:18.371 --> 25:20.770
There's a short cut through there,
to the next valley.

25:20.771 --> 25:22.530
You weren't going into the forest?

25:22.531 --> 25:24.491
No. No. Just to the next valley.

25:45.691 --> 25:49.090
How did he get on with everyone?
Really well.

25:49.091 --> 25:51.250
He didn't get into any arguments?

25:51.251 --> 25:53.531
Fights? Make any enemies?

25:55.171 --> 25:57.691
Wasn't the type. What about you?

25:59.651 --> 26:01.691
Did you like him?

26:04.731 --> 26:06.531
Yes. We all did.

26:07.851 --> 26:09.451
It's very sad.

26:23.811 --> 26:25.690
How long was he here for?

26:25.691 --> 26:28.491
A few weeks.
He had the little room upstairs.

26:29.651 --> 26:31.291
Can I see it?

26:32.491 --> 26:34.691
Sorry. Sorry.

26:44.851 --> 26:48.530
He was great with Defi
and Defi loved him too.

26:48.531 --> 26:50.491
He knew a lot about wildlife.

26:52.131 --> 26:54.451
Defi's mad about animals and birds.

26:55.691 --> 26:58.211
Owls. Yeah.

27:02.971 --> 27:04.531
Let me help.

27:12.851 --> 27:14.291
I...

27:16.011 --> 27:18.330
..haven't got enough time
to spend with him.

27:18.331 --> 27:20.690
Michael took him for walks
in the woods.

27:20.691 --> 27:23.850
Defi always came back
full of the things they'd seen.

27:23.851 --> 27:25.890
That's very trusting of you.

27:25.891 --> 27:27.731
Do you think so?

27:39.931 --> 27:42.171
Terrible news about Michael.

27:43.371 --> 27:45.210
Please don't mention it to Defi.

27:45.211 --> 27:47.571
We'll find our own
way of breaking it to him.

28:07.691 --> 28:09.691
Mrs James go lamping too?

28:11.571 --> 28:13.130
Just the boys.

28:13.131 --> 28:15.050
You, Dic and Gwilym?

28:15.051 --> 28:16.371
That's right.

28:24.131 --> 28:26.090
Did he leave anything?

28:26.091 --> 28:29.371
Any clothes,
any personal items of any sort? No.

28:30.371 --> 28:32.131
No. Nothing.

28:36.291 --> 28:38.251
You all right?

28:39.811 --> 28:41.850
I just can't believe it.

28:41.851 --> 28:43.091
Sorry...

28:46.651 --> 28:47.971
Lowri...?

29:00.451 --> 29:01.691
Michael.

29:50.851 --> 29:52.650
Lloyd?

29:52.651 --> 29:54.530
We ran a check on Wyn Bratton.

29:54.531 --> 29:57.970
His ex-wife moved herself and their
two kids in with the new lover.

29:57.971 --> 29:59.770
Bratton set light to his house.

29:59.771 --> 30:02.170
And? They got out OK.

30:02.171 --> 30:06.531
Bratton got three years.
That was 2005.

30:11.571 --> 30:12.851
Defi.

30:15.531 --> 30:18.211
Where would you go
if you want to see an owl?

30:19.691 --> 30:21.370
Mr Owl knows.

30:21.371 --> 30:23.330
Mr Owl?

30:23.331 --> 30:25.131
He's Michael's friend.

30:26.451 --> 30:29.211
He lives in the forest. Defi!

32:26.451 --> 32:29.411
I came to see if Wyn had
heard the news about Michael.

32:31.091 --> 32:33.091
I thought you said
you didn't know him.

32:35.891 --> 32:38.811
I was shocked.
So you were friends?

32:41.811 --> 32:44.971
Sort of. He came here sometimes.
With Defi James?

32:46.851 --> 32:48.531
That's his drawing, isn't it?

32:51.771 --> 32:55.650
I showed him a barn owl one night.
Next time, he gave me that.

32:55.651 --> 32:58.211
Michael brought him
here a few times.

32:59.891 --> 33:01.611
When was the last time you saw him?

33:03.731 --> 33:06.210
The week before he left.
Did he tell you he was leaving?

33:06.211 --> 33:07.570
No.

33:07.571 --> 33:09.811
Didn't you think that that was odd?

33:11.571 --> 33:13.651
That's what people do, isn't it?

33:30.611 --> 33:32.731
What are their names?

33:34.571 --> 33:36.131
It doesn't matter.

33:43.771 --> 33:45.890
He and Michael had a lot in common.

33:45.891 --> 33:50.211
Michael had just lost
his mam and dad and Wyn, well...

33:51.491 --> 33:54.931
The two boys in the photo, he's not
allowed to see them any more.

33:56.811 --> 34:01.131
Michael started bringing Defi up
here and he was really happy.

34:02.131 --> 34:04.291
Then Tommy put a stop to that. Why?

34:05.531 --> 34:09.050
Cos he's an oddball who lives
in a caravan on his own, I suppose.

34:09.051 --> 34:11.690
No other reason?
Not that I know of.

34:11.690 --> 34:15.251
Wyn's an outsider and
what Tommy says goes around here.

34:16.451 --> 34:19.170
Anyway, Wyn went into his shell
after that.

34:19.170 --> 34:22.370
He won't talk to anyone about it.
Not even to you?

34:22.371 --> 34:24.371
No, not even to me.

34:26.411 --> 34:29.130
Would you drop me off
outside the village? Why?

34:29.130 --> 34:31.931
Well...
You'd rather not be seen with me.

34:33.251 --> 34:34.891
No worries.

35:17.491 --> 35:20.730
2003, Bratton and his wife divorce.

35:20.731 --> 35:23.410
She claims he'd beaten her
several times over the years.

35:23.411 --> 35:26.050
She's granted sole custody
of their boys,

35:26.051 --> 35:28.770
aged four and six at the time,
and moves away.

35:28.771 --> 35:31.090
Bratton gets monthly
visiting rights

35:31.091 --> 35:33.530
but the boys don't want
anything to do with him.

35:33.531 --> 35:35.970
He accuses her of turning them
against him.

35:35.971 --> 35:38.010
There's a fight with
the new boyfriend

35:38.011 --> 35:40.170
and a day later,
he torches the house.

35:40.171 --> 35:42.570
A neighbour sees flames,
alerts the wife.

35:42.571 --> 35:44.850
She and the boys get out
without injury.

35:44.851 --> 35:48.010
Bratton claims in court that he
thought the house was empty,

35:48.011 --> 35:51.010
that he loves his boys and would
never do anything to harm them.

35:51.011 --> 35:52.450
What did he get?

35:52.451 --> 35:55.570
Three years and banned from going
anywhere near her and the boys.

35:55.571 --> 35:58.411
I don't think
he intended to kill anyone.

35:59.491 --> 36:02.051
And none of this
makes him our killer.

36:05.091 --> 36:08.570
Intuition, sir. Is that reason
enough not to bring him in?

36:08.571 --> 36:11.890
He's got no motive to kill
Michael Reynolds, sir.

36:11.891 --> 36:15.011
Has no alibi either
and a history of violence.

36:17.451 --> 36:20.370
Now, those children
were only four and...

36:20.371 --> 36:22.250
Six years old, sir! Yes, I know.

36:22.251 --> 36:24.970
And he's spent the last four years
on his own in that forest

36:24.971 --> 36:26.771
regretting every minute of it.

36:28.371 --> 36:29.891
Living in a caravan.

37:52.331 --> 37:54.091
You all right?

38:09.811 --> 38:12.050
Sorry to bother you.
It's about Bratton.

38:12.051 --> 38:13.771
I'll catch you up.

38:26.331 --> 38:29.690
I think he killed Michael.
For what reason?

38:29.691 --> 38:31.490
They knew each other...

38:31.491 --> 38:36.131
And I had the idea that maybe
the missing camper van was
up in the forest.

38:43.571 --> 38:46.451
That's where I was going yesterday.
To look for it.

38:47.731 --> 38:50.250
But we didn't know it was
Michael at that point.

38:50.251 --> 38:54.931
Yeah, but there was a body
and Bratton's got a record.

38:57.291 --> 39:01.130
I saw him the night Michael
went missing by the quarry.

39:01.131 --> 39:04.690
It was a terrible night, raining
hard and I remember thinking,

39:04.691 --> 39:07.290
"What the hell is he doing
out on a night like this?"

39:07.291 --> 39:09.930
So why were you out there?
I was on my way to the pub.

39:09.931 --> 39:11.970
You remember, Tommy?

39:11.971 --> 39:15.250
Can't say off the top of my head,
but then I can't remember

39:15.251 --> 39:17.090
when you weren't in the pub.

39:17.091 --> 39:18.970
Right.

39:18.971 --> 39:22.010
It has to be him
because it's not one of us.

39:22.011 --> 39:25.091
Nobody in this village
would do something like that.

39:26.811 --> 39:28.531
It's him.

39:29.611 --> 39:31.651
I'm right, aren't I?

39:35.291 --> 39:37.810
Offside front tyre's
got a slit in it.

39:37.811 --> 39:39.891
Slap a new one on for me, will you?

39:48.771 --> 39:50.970
Would you be surprised to know
if I told you

39:50.971 --> 39:53.610
that one of Defi's drawings
was in Bratton's caravan?

39:53.611 --> 39:54.930
No.

39:54.931 --> 39:56.851
But you put a stop to his visits?

39:58.691 --> 40:01.490
He's 12 years old and vulnerable.

40:01.491 --> 40:03.051
What would you do?

40:17.691 --> 40:18.931
Mrs James?

40:41.211 --> 40:42.731
Carry on.

40:44.211 --> 40:47.410
We weren't sure if he was talking
about the birds or a person.

40:47.411 --> 40:49.770
But we soon realised
he meant Bratton.

40:49.771 --> 40:52.170
And that was a problem for you?

40:52.171 --> 40:54.690
We were happy for Defi to spend
time with Michael

40:54.691 --> 40:57.131
but not Bratton,
not in that caravan.

41:01.531 --> 41:03.851
Being Michael, he defended Bratton.

41:04.811 --> 41:07.810
He said Tommy was being unfair
just because he didn't fit in.

41:07.811 --> 41:11.650
Did your husband ever feel that
Michael was undermining his
relationship with Defi?

41:11.651 --> 41:13.091
Not at all.

41:14.171 --> 41:17.290
Tommy was pleased Defi had a made
a real friend. We both were.

41:17.291 --> 41:19.611
Michael wasn't here very long,
was he?

41:21.211 --> 41:24.690
You placed a lot of trust in him.
You never met Michael.

41:24.691 --> 41:26.610
Either of you.

41:26.611 --> 41:28.531
You'd understand if you had.

41:32.771 --> 41:35.890
We're trying to establish what
Michael did in the days

41:35.891 --> 41:37.531
leading up to his death, Mr James.

41:39.011 --> 41:41.530
We know he spent quite
a lot of time with Defi.

41:41.531 --> 41:45.290
I'd like to talk to him.
No, he's just a child.

41:45.291 --> 41:48.970
Gwyneth, we can't keep him
wrapped in cotton wool forever.

41:48.971 --> 41:50.611
Where is he?

41:51.891 --> 41:53.451
In the garden.

41:58.331 --> 41:59.491
Defi?

42:00.811 --> 42:02.091
Defi!

42:04.811 --> 42:06.490
Defi!

42:06.491 --> 42:08.091
Defi!

42:12.811 --> 42:14.291
Defi!

42:17.851 --> 42:20.290
Defi! Where are you?

42:20.291 --> 42:22.331
Defi.

42:26.331 --> 42:27.611
Defi!

42:29.171 --> 42:30.691
Defi!

42:33.611 --> 42:35.131
Defi!

42:42.731 --> 42:45.410
There'll be a team of officers
here in half an hour.

42:45.411 --> 42:47.051
I can't wait that long.

42:49.131 --> 42:50.931
I've been all over the village.

42:53.011 --> 42:56.090
I'm telling you, it's Bratton.

42:56.091 --> 42:59.210
Hey, we don't know anything
for sure yet.

42:59.211 --> 43:00.690
Drink that.

43:00.691 --> 43:03.570
See if there's anything in those
paintings that can give us a clue.

43:03.571 --> 43:05.891
What's the point?
Will you just look at them?

43:30.211 --> 43:32.210
What is it, Tommy?

43:32.211 --> 43:35.251
That could be Defi.
Who's the big one? Michael?

43:36.371 --> 43:38.290
No. It could be Bratton.

43:38.291 --> 43:41.251
The quarry. It's the one place
we haven't looked.

44:04.491 --> 44:06.531
Come on! Come on!

44:32.291 --> 44:33.731
Mammy!

45:44.891 --> 45:47.331
Gwil! Agor y drws!

46:21.451 --> 46:22.810
Lloyd?

46:22.811 --> 46:24.690
Sir, it's Gwilym Morgan.

46:24.691 --> 46:27.211
Dic Rees has just found him
dead in his garage.

47:40.451 --> 47:41.851
Thank you.

47:44.691 --> 47:48.410
Onset of rigor puts time of death
between two and four this morning.

47:48.411 --> 47:50.490
His best friend's son
goes missing

47:50.491 --> 47:53.330
and he was the only one who doesn't
help look for him.

47:53.331 --> 47:55.330
Where did he go?

47:55.331 --> 47:57.650
The firearms register shows
he has a licence

47:57.651 --> 48:00.810
for a 12 bore,
double barrel shotgun.

48:00.811 --> 48:04.210
Looks like it was his own gun.
It was loaded with game shot.

48:04.211 --> 48:08.331
24 hours ago, he stood here trying
to convince me that Bratton killed
Michael Reynolds.

48:09.851 --> 48:11.970
Why this? Why now?

48:11.971 --> 48:14.491
Maybe the guilt caught up
with him. Maybe.

48:15.531 --> 48:17.451
Straightforward suicide, then.

48:21.091 --> 48:25.291
Tell ballistics to call me as soon
as they've got a report. Yes, sir.

50:38.451 --> 50:40.611
This is harassment.

50:41.891 --> 50:45.250
Gwilym Morgan died in the
early hours of this morning.

50:45.251 --> 50:47.211
Shot himself by the looks of it.

50:49.371 --> 50:51.051
You don't seem very sorry.

50:53.331 --> 50:55.051
I hardly knew him.

50:58.171 --> 51:01.210
When did you last see him?
I can't remember.

51:01.211 --> 51:05.570
Well, he said that he saw you at the
quarry the night Michael died.

51:05.571 --> 51:07.770
He was lying. Where were you, then?

51:07.771 --> 51:10.891
Here. Can you prove that?

51:15.371 --> 51:17.011
You know I can't.

51:23.131 --> 51:25.210
I liked him.
Why would I kill him?

51:25.211 --> 51:27.251
Why would Gwilym lie?

51:33.571 --> 51:35.810
He's always had it in for me.

51:35.811 --> 51:38.731
Him and his little gang -
Tommy, Dic and him.

51:41.011 --> 51:43.091
Could Gwilym have killed Michael?

51:44.251 --> 51:45.891
Only he knows that.

51:48.971 --> 51:51.131
Where were you last night?
Trying to sleep.

51:52.371 --> 51:55.771
You have trouble sleeping?
Sometimes.

51:57.451 --> 51:59.491
I went for a spin. It helps.

52:00.891 --> 52:03.491
How do you sleep?
Where do you get your water from?

52:05.091 --> 52:06.771
Cooking, washing.

52:08.051 --> 52:10.171
Where does it come from?

52:11.891 --> 52:13.451
I fill containers.

52:14.451 --> 52:16.011
From the pub?

52:17.131 --> 52:19.771
Not any more.
Since Michael left?

52:21.171 --> 52:24.531
About that time, yeah. So what now?
You just use the streams?

52:27.891 --> 52:31.411
Things live and die in streams, fill
them with piss and decay, so, no.

52:32.731 --> 52:34.451
No, I use rain water.

52:36.331 --> 52:39.410
'You don't think it's odd that
Gwilym didn't help look for Defi?

52:39.411 --> 52:41.290
He did, didn't he?

52:41.291 --> 52:43.330
Apparently not.

52:43.331 --> 52:45.930
What time did you
get to bed last night?

52:45.931 --> 52:49.011
Just after Dic got in.
About half twelve?

52:50.251 --> 52:53.451
Did you tell him
you'd been out to see Bratton?

52:55.611 --> 52:57.930
No. Why not?

52:57.931 --> 53:01.130
I don't tell him what I'm up to
every minute of the day.

53:01.131 --> 53:03.011
That's not the reason, is it?

53:05.411 --> 53:09.251
You didn't tell him
because you didn't want him
to know about the affair.

53:13.251 --> 53:16.291
How did you find out about that?
It's pretty obvious.

53:18.171 --> 53:21.131
I wanted to know if he'd said
anything about it to Dic.

53:22.371 --> 53:25.130
Why would Bratton tell Dic?
Lowri, you're not making any sense.

53:25.131 --> 53:27.810
Are you, or are you not having
an affair with Bratton?

53:27.811 --> 53:30.771
Bratton? No.

53:34.531 --> 53:37.371
You were having an affair
with Michael Reynolds?

53:43.571 --> 53:45.891
He was like a brother to me.

53:46.851 --> 53:48.691
If he was in any trouble...

53:51.171 --> 53:56.050
All he had to do was ask
and I'd be there for him always.

53:56.051 --> 53:58.011
When did you last see him last?

53:58.971 --> 54:02.731
Last night, in the pub.
He was worried about Defi.

54:04.331 --> 54:05.971
Like we all were.

54:17.611 --> 54:21.450
Could Gwilym have had anything to do
with Michael Reynolds's death?

54:21.451 --> 54:23.010
No.

54:23.011 --> 54:24.731
Not Gwilym.

54:33.771 --> 54:36.531
Michael persuaded Wyn
to let us use his caravan.

54:37.851 --> 54:42.091
When you told me who it was
in the quarry... I panicked.

54:43.171 --> 54:45.850
I had to know if Wyn had told
Dic about me and Michael.

54:45.851 --> 54:47.691
He said he hadn't.

54:50.091 --> 54:52.091
I was so relieved. Why?

54:53.491 --> 54:55.891
It means Dic's in the clear.

54:58.171 --> 55:00.651
What happened the night
Michael went?

55:02.251 --> 55:04.291
I was out, got back late.

55:07.251 --> 55:11.210
Dic told me that the camper van
was fixed and that he'd gone.

55:11.211 --> 55:14.131
How did you feel about that?
How do you think?

55:16.291 --> 55:18.131
He didn't even say goodbye.

55:20.931 --> 55:23.611
I didn't hear a word from him,
until this...

55:28.331 --> 55:30.291
"M." Michael.

55:32.371 --> 55:35.810
I keep thinking, you could be wrong,
couldn't you?

55:35.811 --> 55:37.451
About Michael?

55:38.571 --> 55:40.930
Mix-ups happen, don't they?

55:40.931 --> 55:45.451
I mean, if he's dead, how could
he have sent me that in April?

55:46.771 --> 55:48.690
Lowri, Michael's dead.

55:48.691 --> 55:50.851
And he has been since February.

56:02.091 --> 56:04.330
Postmarked April 9th.

56:04.331 --> 56:06.730
Does she have any idea who sent it?
No.

56:06.731 --> 56:09.970
But whoever it was wanted her to
think that he was still alive.

56:09.971 --> 56:12.650
Find out if anyone from Penwyllt
was in Dublin in April.

56:12.651 --> 56:15.530
Ferries, airlines,
scour the passenger lists. Yes, sir.

56:15.531 --> 56:19.730
Get someone onto Ynysuchaf School
for a sample of Michael's
handwriting. OK.

56:19.731 --> 56:23.770
Lowri and Michael were using
Bratton's caravan for sex. What?

56:23.771 --> 56:25.610
Bratton wasn't happy about it.

56:25.611 --> 56:28.091
Dic Rees know about that?
She says not.

56:29.211 --> 56:31.610
Let's get him in for a chat.

56:31.611 --> 56:34.370
Mared Rhys. Hang on.

56:34.371 --> 56:36.171
Ballistics for you.

56:37.611 --> 56:39.171
Mathias.

57:38.811 --> 57:41.370
'The preliminary report
from the postmortem

57:41.371 --> 57:44.250
'and the assessment of the
ballistics experts have cast doubt

57:44.251 --> 57:46.970
'on what happened the night
Gwilym Morgan died.'

57:46.971 --> 57:50.610
Our initial analysis of events
at the scene was wrong.

57:50.611 --> 57:54.130
Further investigation has shown
that the length of the gun barrel

57:54.131 --> 57:57.610
was too long for Gwilym to have been
able to reach the trigger himself,

57:57.611 --> 57:59.890
and no evidence has been
found of any mechanism

57:59.891 --> 58:01.730
which would have enabled him
to do so.

58:01.731 --> 58:04.010
Gwilym Morgan did not kill himself.

58:04.011 --> 58:07.530
The distribution of debris from the
head indicates that the angle

58:07.531 --> 58:10.530
at which he was shot is not
consistent with the gun being fired

58:10.531 --> 58:12.690
by the deceased himself.

58:12.691 --> 58:14.531
Gwilym Morgan was murdered.

58:24.595 --> 58:27.914
Gwilym Morgan kept his shotgun
locked in a gun cabinet
in the workshop.

58:27.915 --> 58:31.874
Whoever did it knew Morgan
and knew the keys to the cabinet
were in the desk.

58:31.875 --> 58:35.834
And they killed him to silence him
about the death of Michael Reynolds.

58:35.835 --> 58:39.314
Tommy and Gwyneth James,
Lowri and Dic Rees

58:39.315 --> 58:41.914
all have alibis for the night
that Gwilym died.

58:41.915 --> 58:43.675
And Bratton doesn't.

58:45.475 --> 58:48.034
Bring Bratton in and question him.

58:48.035 --> 58:49.675
Now.

01:00:26.555 --> 01:00:28.555
Did you like them using your place?

01:00:31.555 --> 01:00:34.355
I wasn't keen, no.
But you still let them carry on?

01:00:36.035 --> 01:00:37.075
Why?

01:00:38.595 --> 01:00:40.155
He was a friend.

01:00:41.155 --> 01:00:44.714
'The other day at the caravan,
when you fired the crossbow,

01:00:44.715 --> 01:00:46.515
'who did you think I was?'

01:00:47.875 --> 01:00:50.715
You thought
I was Dic Rees, didn't you?

01:00:52.355 --> 01:00:54.834
You knew that his wife was having
an affair with Reynolds

01:00:54.835 --> 01:00:57.394
and you did nothing.
I didn't want to get involved.

01:00:57.395 --> 01:00:59.315
You are involved, Wyn.

01:01:01.395 --> 01:01:04.314
You let them have sex
in your caravan.

01:01:04.315 --> 01:01:07.075
You let Defi hang his drawings
on your wall.

01:01:08.715 --> 01:01:10.674
You think
you don't need these people

01:01:10.675 --> 01:01:13.275
but the truth is, you can't live
without them.

01:01:14.275 --> 01:01:15.874
Leave Defi out of this.

01:01:15.875 --> 01:01:17.715
He liked you, Wyn.

01:01:18.755 --> 01:01:20.955
He called you Mr Owl.

01:01:22.115 --> 01:01:24.355
Why did he stop coming to see you?

01:01:26.395 --> 01:01:28.275
Did Tommy warn you off?

01:01:31.235 --> 01:01:33.035
Wyn?

01:01:39.475 --> 01:01:42.154
He said he'd break my legs
if I went near Defi again.

01:01:42.155 --> 01:01:44.434
Michael stopped
bringing him after that.

01:01:44.435 --> 01:01:46.555
Is that why you kept his drawings?

01:01:49.715 --> 01:01:51.875
Defi.

01:01:53.435 --> 01:01:56.035
He must be the same age
as one of your boys.

01:01:57.275 --> 01:01:59.075
Isn't he?

01:02:03.195 --> 01:02:04.835
Sam. Sam.

01:02:06.315 --> 01:02:09.515
Sam and..? Harri.
Harri. Sam and Harri.

01:02:13.075 --> 01:02:15.355
You tried to burn their house down.

01:02:19.235 --> 01:02:21.755
I didn't know they were in there.
So you say.

01:02:23.715 --> 01:02:25.755
I would never harm them.

01:02:39.315 --> 01:02:41.395
I think you fancied Lowri yourself.

01:02:42.955 --> 01:02:44.234
No.

01:02:44.235 --> 01:02:47.595
But you were too scared of Dic
and his pals to make a play for her.

01:02:48.915 --> 01:02:52.394
You were jealous of Michael. No.

01:02:52.395 --> 01:02:54.594
You fell out with him about it.

01:02:54.595 --> 01:02:56.794
You really lost it.

01:02:56.795 --> 01:03:01.394
You drowned him in a stream in the
forest and dumped him in the quarry.

01:03:01.395 --> 01:03:04.634
I never touched him. And somehow
Gwilym found out about this

01:03:04.635 --> 01:03:07.154
and you went there last night
and killed him, too.

01:03:07.155 --> 01:03:09.995
No, no, no!

01:03:13.155 --> 01:03:15.115
OK. You're free to go.

01:03:26.555 --> 01:03:28.114
I didn't kill Michael.

01:03:28.115 --> 01:03:29.675
I didn't kill Gwilym.

01:03:33.115 --> 01:03:35.115
That'll be all, DS Owens.

01:03:36.995 --> 01:03:38.794
What the hell are you doing?

01:03:38.795 --> 01:03:41.274
Bratton knows something,
that's for sure,

01:03:41.275 --> 01:03:43.274
but so do Dic Rees and Tommy James.

01:03:43.275 --> 01:03:46.434
Something happened in that village
and I know they're all involved.

01:03:46.435 --> 01:03:48.514
You'd better be
right about this, Tom,

01:03:48.515 --> 01:03:52.275
because the last time I went out on
a limb for you, a man ended up dead.

01:03:54.395 --> 01:03:56.954
Sir, we checked Bratton's place.
Nothing.

01:03:56.955 --> 01:03:58.474
Michael's clothing?

01:03:58.475 --> 01:04:01.074
No, sir. No sign of them.
We checked the whole clearing.

01:04:01.075 --> 01:04:04.515
Inside the caravan, under it, the
rainwater butt, everywhere. Nothing.

01:04:06.795 --> 01:04:09.554
Take Bratton back to his caravan,
keep him talking.

01:04:09.555 --> 01:04:10.995
Right, sir.

01:04:31.155 --> 01:04:33.274
Did Dic Rees know about the affair?

01:04:33.275 --> 01:04:37.474
I really don't know, but if he did,
it would give him a clear motive
for killing Michael.

01:04:37.475 --> 01:04:40.954
Tommy and Gwyneth James
flew to Dublin. When? April the 7th.

01:04:40.955 --> 01:04:44.434
Here's the postcard from Dublin,
here's Michael's handwriting.

01:04:44.435 --> 01:04:46.274
Completely different.

01:04:46.275 --> 01:04:49.154
If it came from Tommy James, it
suggests he knew Michael was dead.

01:04:49.155 --> 01:04:53.034
Why take the risk of sending a
postcard? To stop Lowri asking
more questions about Michael.

01:04:53.035 --> 01:04:55.474
Hold on! Is this Tommy's
handwriting?

01:04:55.475 --> 01:04:57.714
We don't have a sample.

01:04:57.715 --> 01:04:59.315
No, we do. Where's that box?

01:05:11.955 --> 01:05:13.715
Here's a handwritten entry.

01:05:23.115 --> 01:05:25.315
These were written
by the same person.

01:05:46.555 --> 01:05:49.994
What now?

01:05:49.995 --> 01:05:51.515
Is this your writing?

01:05:53.195 --> 01:05:55.914
No. Are you sure? Certain.

01:05:55.915 --> 01:05:58.955
I need to see a sample of your
handwriting then, Mr James.

01:06:01.875 --> 01:06:03.915
There'll be something in the office.

01:06:06.995 --> 01:06:08.315
Defi.

01:06:10.515 --> 01:06:12.514
What's that, Defi?

01:06:12.515 --> 01:06:15.914
It's me, Daddy and Uncle Dic
when we used to go to the quarry.

01:06:15.915 --> 01:06:19.355
We used to go and watch the animals.
Those were the days.

01:06:26.915 --> 01:06:31.595
We've been keeping an eye out,
like you asked, no sign of the van.

01:06:33.355 --> 01:06:37.114
That forest is a big place.
Asked Bratton about it, have you?

01:06:37.115 --> 01:06:39.595
He told us that you threatened him.

01:06:40.835 --> 01:06:42.594
I just...

01:06:42.595 --> 01:06:46.474
I made it very clear
I didn't want Defi to go up there.

01:06:46.475 --> 01:06:49.114
Come on, be fair. Would you want
your kids hanging around

01:06:49.115 --> 01:06:51.715
that caravan with the likes of him?

01:06:52.795 --> 01:06:54.635
That's my writing.

01:06:58.955 --> 01:07:02.834
You took a flight to Dublin
on April the 7th? That's right.

01:07:02.835 --> 01:07:06.194
You don't deny it?
No. We both went. Me and Gwyneth.

01:07:06.195 --> 01:07:09.195
Wedding anniversary. Excuse us.

01:07:15.035 --> 01:07:17.595
When did you find out that Lowri
was having an affair?

01:07:21.595 --> 01:07:24.915
She told Gwyneth.
And nobody said anything to Dic?

01:07:27.195 --> 01:07:29.075
It would have broken his heart.

01:08:08.755 --> 01:08:11.355
I've loved Lowri
for as long as I can remember.

01:08:15.035 --> 01:08:18.314
I told her that I'd never leave her
and I never will.

01:08:18.314 --> 01:08:20.795
When did you find out
about her and Michael?

01:08:23.875 --> 01:08:25.634
I knew something was wrong.

01:08:25.635 --> 01:08:29.435
What difference does that make?
When, Dic?

01:08:32.475 --> 01:08:34.635
Today. At the station.

01:10:00.355 --> 01:10:02.674
Stop the car.
What?

01:10:02.675 --> 01:10:04.555
Stop the car.
Please.

01:10:16.715 --> 01:10:20.115
Someone's been here.
Our boys were here a few hours ago.

01:10:21.595 --> 01:10:24.275
Down there? No.

01:10:26.835 --> 01:10:28.915
Someone's been down there.

01:11:11.835 --> 01:11:13.874
Are you sure about this?

01:11:13.875 --> 01:11:15.834
Of course I'm sure.

01:11:15.835 --> 01:11:18.235
Come on, there's more tracks
down here.

01:11:29.435 --> 01:11:32.315
There's something down here,
behind those trees.

01:11:44.155 --> 01:11:45.795
Grab this.

01:12:09.875 --> 01:12:12.794
It must have been here
since the murder, sir.

01:12:12.795 --> 01:12:16.074
The killer would have wanted to
hide it as soon as possible.

01:12:16.075 --> 01:12:19.715
The night Michael disappeared?
Yes, sir. The 22nd of February. No.

01:12:21.395 --> 01:12:24.114
There would be marks
where the wheels stood,

01:12:24.115 --> 01:12:26.194
the grass would be yellow.

01:12:26.195 --> 01:12:28.314
This is too clean.

01:12:28.315 --> 01:12:31.394
It should be covered in pine
needles, filthy from the rain.

01:12:31.395 --> 01:12:34.754
These trees, Lloyd, have just
been cut down. Look...

01:12:34.755 --> 01:12:37.474
These tracks weren't made in
February. They're too fresh.

01:12:37.475 --> 01:12:40.954
A couple of days at most.
What have you got to say about it?

01:12:40.955 --> 01:12:42.874
It wasn't here before.

01:12:42.875 --> 01:12:46.434
But you knew where it was.
You brought Lloyd straight to it.

01:12:46.435 --> 01:12:49.594
I was in this clearing two days ago
and I'm telling you, it wasn't here.

01:12:49.595 --> 01:12:52.514
Somebody must have put it here
whilst I was down in Aber with you.

01:12:52.515 --> 01:12:54.354
"Somebody?"

01:12:54.355 --> 01:12:57.715
Yeah, somebody who wants you
to think I killed Michael.

01:12:58.795 --> 01:13:02.874
So remind me, where were you on the
night of the 22nd of February?

01:13:02.875 --> 01:13:05.395
Here.
Did you see Michael that night?

01:13:06.715 --> 01:13:09.634
No. Wasn't he in your caravan
with Lowri?

01:13:09.635 --> 01:13:12.114
The last time I saw Michael
was a week before he left.

01:13:12.115 --> 01:13:13.994
Can anyone verify
that you were here?

01:13:13.995 --> 01:13:16.274
No, I told you,
no-one was out that night.

01:13:16.275 --> 01:13:19.434
I was up until the early hours,
trying to fix a leak in the roof.

01:13:19.435 --> 01:13:21.475
I've never seen rain like it.

01:13:26.395 --> 01:13:27.995
Don't go too far, Wyn.

01:13:30.915 --> 01:13:32.835
Lloyd, come with me.

01:13:38.675 --> 01:13:41.955
Do you know where I was,
the night he disappeared?

01:13:44.075 --> 01:13:47.075
In Fishguard,
buying tickets for the ferry.

01:13:49.635 --> 01:13:53.275
We were going to take off to Ireland
together, in his camper van.

01:13:55.675 --> 01:13:57.675
It took me hours to get home.

01:13:58.955 --> 01:14:01.154
The rain was terrible.

01:14:01.155 --> 01:14:05.155
Tommy and Gwilym and Dic
were still in here, drinking.

01:14:07.355 --> 01:14:09.515
And Michael had gone.

01:14:10.555 --> 01:14:12.515
That's what they told me.

01:14:22.835 --> 01:14:24.715
Why have we stopped here, sir?

01:14:44.115 --> 01:14:46.794
Something's dislodged this.

01:14:46.795 --> 01:14:48.995
Our trucks, probably.

01:14:51.955 --> 01:14:54.195
This bolt has been cut.

01:16:01.955 --> 01:16:04.795
"I've never seen rain like it" -
that's what Bratton said.

01:16:09.155 --> 01:16:11.674
This is where Michael Reynolds
drowned.

01:16:11.675 --> 01:16:14.074
The bruising on his face,
the fingernails,

01:16:14.075 --> 01:16:15.994
this is where he died,

01:16:15.995 --> 01:16:18.515
pushing up against the bars,
gasping for breath.

01:16:41.555 --> 01:16:44.875
Is it deep enough to drown in?
If it was full.

01:16:46.475 --> 01:16:50.994
Listen, that gully carries all the
waste from that sheep pen, right?

01:16:50.995 --> 01:16:53.634
Right. I think there was so much
water running down

01:16:53.635 --> 01:16:56.754
from this hillside on the night
of the 22nd of February

01:16:56.755 --> 01:16:59.275
that it overflowed
and flooded the pit.

01:17:00.595 --> 01:17:04.034
If you were going to murder someone,
would you really do it this way?

01:17:04.035 --> 01:17:06.395
What if murder wasn't the intention?

01:17:07.555 --> 01:17:10.595
Sir, over there.

01:17:35.515 --> 01:17:38.034
Thanks, Lloyd, go get your car.

01:17:38.035 --> 01:17:41.674
Someone puts Michael Reynolds under
the cattle-grid and leaves him.

01:17:41.675 --> 01:17:44.314
To frighten him? To warn him.

01:17:44.315 --> 01:17:47.354
When they come back and see
that he's drowned, they panic,

01:17:47.355 --> 01:17:49.674
take the body
and dump him in the quarry.

01:17:49.675 --> 01:17:51.554
Was Gwilym involved?

01:17:51.555 --> 01:17:54.115
I think he knew about it.
That's why he was silenced.

01:18:05.235 --> 01:18:07.154
You were in bed asleep?
What, all night?

01:18:07.155 --> 01:18:10.675
I went out to the bathroom,
but that apart, yes.

01:18:19.235 --> 01:18:21.954
I'd only been downstairs
about a quarter of an hour

01:18:21.955 --> 01:18:24.314
when Dic came banging on the door.

01:18:24.315 --> 01:18:27.514
Dic came to you first?
In a hell of a state, he was.

01:18:27.515 --> 01:18:30.675
He told me what he'd found,
about Gwilym.

01:18:34.475 --> 01:18:37.115
And then? We rang 999.

01:18:57.075 --> 01:18:59.954
Mathias.

01:18:59.955 --> 01:19:03.194
Sir, you've got to get up to the
forest road. Bratton's on the move.

01:19:03.195 --> 01:19:04.994
Bratton's running.

01:19:04.995 --> 01:19:07.395
Get onto Traffic, get him stopped.

01:19:42.155 --> 01:19:43.635
Shit!

01:20:13.955 --> 01:20:14.995
Sir?

01:20:18.235 --> 01:20:20.635
I found these in the back
of Bratton's truck.

01:20:24.675 --> 01:20:26.355
They must be Michael's.

01:20:44.995 --> 01:20:47.434
Recognise these, Wyn? No.

01:20:47.435 --> 01:20:49.714
You know where we found them?

01:20:49.715 --> 01:20:51.995
The back of your Land Rover.

01:20:53.435 --> 01:20:57.994
These are Michael's clothes
and this is his blood on them.

01:20:57.995 --> 01:21:00.754
I didn't kill him.
Why won't you believe me?

01:21:00.755 --> 01:21:04.194
Oh, I'm trying to, Wyn,
but every time I think you might be
telling the truth,

01:21:04.195 --> 01:21:06.395
something happens to make
me think again.

01:21:11.275 --> 01:21:14.074
How did you miss them?
We didn't, sir.

01:21:14.075 --> 01:21:17.714
The whole area was checked,
including the Land Rover.

01:21:17.715 --> 01:21:21.355
Those clothes weren't there.
I'm absolutely sure of it.

01:21:27.395 --> 01:21:30.635
'Those clothes were planted there.'
By who?

01:21:40.475 --> 01:21:43.155
You know who planted those clothes,
don't you?

01:21:45.635 --> 01:21:48.835
I want to help you, Wyn,
but we're running out of time.

01:21:51.595 --> 01:21:54.155
I know you're scared
and I don't blame you.

01:21:55.275 --> 01:21:57.995
But I can't help you
if you won't tell me.

01:22:05.835 --> 01:22:07.675
Please, Wyn...

01:22:09.035 --> 01:22:10.755
..before it's too late.

01:22:13.115 --> 01:22:14.635
Help me.

01:22:26.475 --> 01:22:30.075
Tommy James... came to the caravan
this morning.

01:22:31.995 --> 01:22:33.594
He said if I didn't get out
right now,

01:22:33.595 --> 01:22:35.115
he'd do to me what he did to Gwilym.

01:22:39.035 --> 01:22:41.195
He told you that he killed Gwilym?

01:22:50.315 --> 01:22:52.115
The night Michael died...

01:22:55.275 --> 01:22:59.635
..he was up there with the other
two by the cattle-grid.

01:23:02.195 --> 01:23:03.635
The rain was coming down.

01:23:05.315 --> 01:23:07.834
They were chasing him
in that lamping truck,

01:23:07.835 --> 01:23:09.634
making him run around.

01:23:09.635 --> 01:23:12.715
Then Dic gets hold of him
and starts...

01:23:14.515 --> 01:23:18.394
..like, hitting him, kicking him,
just going wild,

01:23:18.395 --> 01:23:20.355
the other two egging him on.

01:23:22.675 --> 01:23:25.594
I should have stopped it. I know
I should have. I wanted to.

01:23:25.595 --> 01:23:28.115
You were scared.

01:23:29.155 --> 01:23:30.715
Not of them.

01:23:33.235 --> 01:23:34.834
I've worked so hard.

01:23:34.835 --> 01:23:37.474
Do you know how hard that is?

01:23:37.475 --> 01:23:39.235
Learning to live on your own?

01:23:43.635 --> 01:23:45.635
You let Defi and Michael get close.

01:23:49.035 --> 01:23:50.994
And Tommy took them away.

01:23:50.995 --> 01:23:52.675
That's why I did nothing, I...

01:23:54.515 --> 01:23:57.075
I saw them put Michael
in the cattle-grid.

01:23:58.115 --> 01:24:00.674
I heard him scream but I walked away.

01:24:00.675 --> 01:24:03.315
I didn't think he'd drown in there
but I walked away.

01:24:05.195 --> 01:24:07.074
I should have helped him.

01:24:07.075 --> 01:24:09.795
He would have helped me,
I know he would have, but...

01:24:12.475 --> 01:24:13.915
..I didn't.

01:24:17.795 --> 01:24:19.275
I didn't.

01:24:38.875 --> 01:24:41.714
The prints in the camper van
all belong to one person, sir.

01:24:41.715 --> 01:24:43.835
Tommy James? Yes, sir.

01:25:09.195 --> 01:25:11.235
Is he here?

01:25:15.595 --> 01:25:18.555
Gwyneth... tell me where he is!

01:29:40.715 --> 01:29:43.155
Right.

01:29:56.475 --> 01:29:58.675
Come on! Come on!

01:30:10.395 --> 01:30:12.354
Come on!

01:30:12.355 --> 01:30:14.395
Come on! Come on!

01:31:33.515 --> 01:31:36.195
We didn't mean to kill
Michael Reynolds.

01:31:38.635 --> 01:31:40.635
Just teach him a lesson.

01:31:42.795 --> 01:31:44.955
Carrying on with Lowri.

01:31:48.235 --> 01:31:50.475
If it hadn't rained so hard...

01:31:52.795 --> 01:31:54.715
..he'd still be alive.

01:32:00.435 --> 01:32:02.035
So would Gwil.

01:32:08.555 --> 01:32:10.515
I loved Gwil...

01:32:12.995 --> 01:32:14.475
..like a brother.

01:32:17.395 --> 01:32:19.395
None of this was meant to happen.

01:32:21.915 --> 01:32:23.515
None of it.

01:32:33.595 --> 01:32:35.155
Well done.

01:32:37.035 --> 01:32:38.635
Thank you, sir.

01:32:44.475 --> 01:32:46.435
Good night. Good night.
