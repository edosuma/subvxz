00:34.640 --> 00:36.600
(camera clicks)

02:28.600 --> 02:33.120
As you know, over the past year I have
been studying the Unas of P3X-888.

02:33.240 --> 02:36.280
I've made some amazing discoveries
about their culture.

02:36.400 --> 02:40.760
I've also been able to categorise almost
70 individual words from their language.

02:40.880 --> 02:45.680
But, during a review of the latest batch
of digital images, I came across this.

02:46.640 --> 02:51.240
These men, whoever they are,
abducted the Unas I refer to as Chaka.

02:51.600 --> 02:54.480
- That's the one that kidnapped you.
- Same one.

02:55.720 --> 02:59.240
Their dress is pre-industrial but
they don't have any Jaffa tattoos,

02:59.360 --> 03:01.920
so their Goa'uld weapons
seem contradictory.

03:02.040 --> 03:03.120
Indeed.

03:03.520 --> 03:07.640
- What would they want with an Unas?
- I don't know. But I'd like to find out.

03:07.720 --> 03:11.320
- What are you suggesting?
- Like Jack said, what do they want?

03:11.440 --> 03:14.080
For the record, I don't care.

03:19.240 --> 03:21.200
I care.

03:21.480 --> 03:24.880
It might be relevant to investigate
how they got Goa'uld weapons.

03:25.080 --> 03:27.200
They may have other Goa'uld technology.

03:27.320 --> 03:29.400
Now, see, that I really care about.

03:29.520 --> 03:32.640
If possible, I'd like to make
every effort to rescue Chaka.

03:33.240 --> 03:34.200
The Unas?

03:34.320 --> 03:37.840
Many Unas we've encountered
had Goa'uld symbiotes controlling them.

03:37.960 --> 03:39.840
Chaka is an ungoa'ulded Unas.

03:39.960 --> 03:43.720
An intelligent being who learned
to trust humans because of me.

03:43.840 --> 03:45.800
And?

03:47.560 --> 03:50.200
These images were taken
just prior to the abduction.

03:50.320 --> 03:53.520
Every time I went back with SG-1 1
to retrieve the video footage,

03:53.600 --> 03:55.560
I would leave Chaka a gift.

03:58.960 --> 04:00.760
It's... It's an energy bar.

04:00.880 --> 04:04.840
It's something that helped me
break through when we first met.

04:06.520 --> 04:08.680
I left the bait for their trap.

04:12.080 --> 04:15.040
How do we find out
where these men took him?

04:20.920 --> 04:25.360
If they've got Goa'uld weapons,
you gotta wonder what else they got.

04:28.680 --> 04:30.560
You have a go.

04:30.640 --> 04:32.560
Thank you.

04:44.760 --> 04:48.800
The UAV shows the nearest town
to be three clicks in that direction.

04:48.920 --> 04:53.360
Evidence of a substantial population -
Iots of cultivated fields.

04:53.440 --> 04:55.520
Farmers?

04:55.640 --> 04:57.600
Farmers with staff weapons.

05:22.640 --> 05:25.040
- Domestication.
- Yeah.

05:27.480 --> 05:29.480
We'll check things out down there.

05:29.600 --> 05:34.720
Carter, you and Teal'c hang back. Cover
us in case these folks don't like visitors.

05:35.800 --> 05:37.600
Any ideas?

05:37.680 --> 05:41.040
Well, let's see how far honesty gets us.

05:44.560 --> 05:46.520
OK.

05:49.960 --> 05:52.920
This animal comes from
an excellent bloodline.

05:54.640 --> 05:58.680
He can crush grain at the stone mill
from first light to day's end.

06:00.000 --> 06:04.040
He can haul any cart,
with any load, any distance.

06:05.880 --> 06:07.080
(Unas growls)

06:07.200 --> 06:09.280
And he has spirit.

06:09.400 --> 06:11.360
(growls)

06:15.960 --> 06:17.920
Who will start the bidding?

06:18.560 --> 06:20.520
(growling)

06:20.880 --> 06:22.840
(woman) Watch out!

06:29.880 --> 06:32.240
(Unas growling)

06:45.880 --> 06:48.440
Do not fear. It's dead.

06:48.840 --> 06:50.400
Yeah.

06:50.520 --> 06:53.800
- Shoot somethin' like that in the back...
- Who are you?

06:54.880 --> 06:57.040
We're travellers. Peaceful travellers.

06:57.240 --> 07:00.120
Where do you come from?
I've not seen your kind before.

07:00.240 --> 07:03.920
Well, actually,
we came through the Stargate.

07:04.240 --> 07:06.200
The, um...

07:07.960 --> 07:10.520
- Chaapa-ai.
- Chaapa-ai.

07:11.040 --> 07:13.280
- Really?
- Yes.

07:16.080 --> 07:19.200
No one has come through
the Chaapa-ai in living memory.

07:19.320 --> 07:21.720
Now you'll have a story
to tell your grandkids.

07:21.840 --> 07:23.960
We come from a planet called Earth.

07:25.640 --> 07:29.040
- What do you want?
- Actually, we came to trade.

07:29.160 --> 07:30.400
Hm?

07:31.240 --> 07:34.440
- Really?
- We're looking for an Unas.

07:34.760 --> 07:36.800
Well, then.

07:36.920 --> 07:39.360
You've come to the right place.

07:39.480 --> 07:42.960
I'm the most respected dealer
of Unas in this land.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.960
My name is Burrock.

07:46.720 --> 07:50.280
I'm Daniel Jackson
and this is Colonel Jack O'Neill.

07:50.400 --> 07:51.560
Colonel?

07:51.680 --> 07:54.040
Yes. It means he's our head... trader.

07:55.440 --> 07:57.360
"Head trader"?

07:57.480 --> 08:00.680
I like that. And you can
call me Colonel Burrock.

08:03.960 --> 08:07.640
It is our custom to welcome visitors
with a drink. Will you join me?

08:07.840 --> 08:10.720
It is our custom to drink. Of course.

08:19.280 --> 08:21.400
- "Honesty", huh?
- We're traders.

08:21.520 --> 08:24.480
We've traded. We trade. We're trading.

08:41.080 --> 08:43.039
Thank you.

08:45.600 --> 08:47.640
You thank a beast?

08:47.760 --> 08:49.880
Yes. Positive reinforcement.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.560
We find it a successful method of training.

08:54.240 --> 08:56.800
I'm curious to learn more
about your methods,

08:56.920 --> 08:59.720
and to learn more about
where you came from.

09:02.440 --> 09:05.480
So no one else has actually
come through the Chaapa-ai?

09:05.880 --> 09:09.080
I have wondered why there are
so many symbols on the pedestal.

09:09.160 --> 09:13.200
I have stood for hours pressing different
combinations, but nothing happened.

09:13.320 --> 09:17.520
The fact that you have come here from a
place we do not know proves I am right.

09:17.640 --> 09:20.600
The Chaapa-ai goes
many places, does it not?

09:20.840 --> 09:24.360
- Haven't you travelled to other worlds?
- I have been to one place.

09:24.480 --> 09:26.880
Just one time, so far.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.120
I had to press seven different symbols
to get the Chaapa-ai to open.

09:31.200 --> 09:33.240
How'd you learn those symbols?

09:33.360 --> 09:35.920
I paid dearly for them.
They have been passed down

09:36.000 --> 09:40.120
through the lineage of certain
families since the Beast Wars.

09:40.240 --> 09:41.120
Beast Wars?

09:41.240 --> 09:45.280
Long ago, the beasts enslaved our
forefathers through terror and oppression.

09:45.360 --> 09:48.240
They served "the one
with the glowing eyes".

09:49.320 --> 09:51.360
And what happened to him, her?

09:52.160 --> 09:55.640
No one knows. One day
he went away, did not return.

09:56.560 --> 10:01.200
Our forefathers learned how the beasts'
weapons worked and led an uprising.

10:01.320 --> 10:04.440
The war was bloody,
waged for many years,

10:04.560 --> 10:06.560
but eventually the slaves triumphed

10:06.680 --> 10:08.800
and the masters became the slaves.

10:08.920 --> 10:12.160
Since then, the beasts have served us.

10:16.320 --> 10:18.280
(roars)

10:24.600 --> 10:29.360
Like the one at the auction that got away,
this one comes from our local stock.

10:30.160 --> 10:32.560
I believe him to be untrainable.

10:32.680 --> 10:35.160
His head is not right, even for a beast.

10:35.480 --> 10:38.360
Maybe he's just pissed
cos you keep torturing him.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.360
The unfortunate result
of generations of inbreeding.

10:43.480 --> 10:45.680
I'm afraid he'll have to be put down.

10:47.880 --> 10:52.000
- Do you not have this problem at home?
- We've made some progress, actually.

10:52.320 --> 10:53.720
Interesting.

10:54.960 --> 10:58.240
The only choice we had
was to introduce new blood.

10:58.360 --> 11:00.640
Fortunately, I was able to find some.

11:19.080 --> 11:23.280
This one will make me
the wealthiest beastmaster in the land.

11:31.480 --> 11:33.440
(huskily) Daniel.

11:34.720 --> 11:37.840
- He speaks?
- Yes.

11:38.080 --> 11:41.280
- Your name.
- Yes. That's because he's mine.

11:43.680 --> 11:45.600
You deceived me!

11:45.720 --> 11:49.760
You said you came here to trade for
an Unas, not to claim one of your own.

11:49.880 --> 11:54.080
I just wanted to make sure he was here
before we made an issue out of it.

11:55.640 --> 12:00.240
These beasts, all of them... bear my mark.

12:00.680 --> 12:03.560
- Yours had no identification.
- You heard him say my name.

12:03.680 --> 12:06.040
I caught him in the wild
of the other place.

12:06.160 --> 12:09.760
It was part of an experiment I was
conducting. Sorry, but I need him back.

12:09.880 --> 12:12.240
Well, I'm sorry. You cannot have him.

12:29.160 --> 12:32.040
Does Colonel O'Neill
require our assistance?

12:33.040 --> 12:34.760
He hasn't signalled yet.

12:40.160 --> 12:43.560
I could offer another Unas in exchange.

12:44.920 --> 12:47.960
This one is of good stock,
and he's already trained.

12:48.080 --> 12:51.840
You don't understand. This one's name
is Chaka, and he is coming with me.

12:56.680 --> 12:58.480
- Uh, Daniel.
- Jack.

12:58.560 --> 13:02.240
Why don't we discuss
what we can offer the man in return?

13:07.040 --> 13:09.240
Shall we?

13:09.360 --> 13:11.320
Outside.

13:23.280 --> 13:25.240
(roars) Daniel!

13:27.480 --> 13:31.600
Daniel, I am not gonna get
into a firefight over this right now.

13:31.720 --> 13:35.920
If you expect to trade for that Unas,
do not think it will come cheap.

13:39.760 --> 13:42.040
So what's your price?

13:42.160 --> 13:44.280
Two Unas of equally pure lineage.

13:45.560 --> 13:47.360
Two for one?

13:47.440 --> 13:50.560
Your Unas is worth it, or you
would not have travelled so far.

13:50.680 --> 13:55.640
Besides, you have more sophisticated
methods for capturing and training them.

13:57.440 --> 13:59.560
We'll... think about it.

14:03.520 --> 14:05.480
Come on.

14:15.640 --> 14:17.600
Excuse me.

14:20.160 --> 14:23.880
You, uh... have some sort of
plan to do something about this?

14:24.680 --> 14:27.960
Well, right now I'm not sure
I'm gonna do anything.

14:29.960 --> 14:32.400
How can you say that?

14:32.520 --> 14:36.400
Daniel, you wanna go out and catch
a couple of Unas, trade 'em for Chaka?

14:36.480 --> 14:38.720
- I think you're missing the point.
- Am l?

14:38.840 --> 14:41.120
- You saw how they treat them.
- Daniel.

14:41.240 --> 14:44.960
I'm not saying any of this is right.
I just don't know what to do about it.

14:45.080 --> 14:47.400
I don't want to change
their way of life, but...

14:47.520 --> 14:50.640
Chaka wasn't born into
this kind of domestication.

14:50.760 --> 14:55.200
He's known freedom all his life. The Unas
of his planet live together in families.

14:55.400 --> 14:58.120
- They have art.
- Oh, yes. I've seen the cave drawings.

14:58.200 --> 15:00.360
I will not leave him here like this.

15:02.600 --> 15:04.680
Even if it means risking human lives?

15:07.960 --> 15:10.760
We should be able
to avoid that, shouldn't we?

15:29.040 --> 15:32.240
- So what's going on?
- They're using Unas as slaves.

15:32.360 --> 15:35.080
They were inbred for so long,
they're untrainable.

15:35.160 --> 15:38.120
They needed new blood
so they're not giving Chaka up.

15:38.200 --> 15:40.240
- What shall we do?
- (O'Neill) Wait until dark.

15:40.360 --> 15:43.960
Daniel and I'll go in and extract him.
You'll provide cover.

15:44.760 --> 15:47.960
And we're gonna do it
without taking human lives.

16:02.720 --> 16:04.600
Down.

16:04.680 --> 16:06.640
(growls)

16:13.760 --> 16:15.720
Down.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.560
(growls)

16:53.760 --> 16:55.920
Chaka.

17:01.560 --> 17:03.560
Chaka.

17:18.400 --> 17:20.960
Chaka.

17:29.240 --> 17:31.200
(door creaks)

17:41.720 --> 17:43.360
- Chaka.
- Daniel.

17:43.440 --> 17:45.400
Tell him to move back.

17:46.200 --> 17:48.520
- Chaka!
- (Chaka growls)

17:48.640 --> 17:51.440
- He's not moving.
- Move back.

17:51.600 --> 17:54.400
- I could have said that.
- Keka. Keka.

17:54.520 --> 17:56.480
Danger.

18:01.440 --> 18:03.400
(roaring)

18:05.080 --> 18:07.640
Crap. Come on, we gotta go.

18:08.360 --> 18:10.320
Come on.

18:11.600 --> 18:14.560
- It's OK, it's OK.
- Wok tah!

18:14.640 --> 18:18.200
- What? I don't know what's wrong.
- Wok tah!

18:18.320 --> 18:22.960
He says this one's marked for death.
Come on, it's OK. He's not. Let's go.

18:23.080 --> 18:24.960
Wok tah!

18:25.080 --> 18:28.200
- Wok tah!
- He says that they're all marked for death.

18:28.280 --> 18:32.160
- No, Chaka.
- Daniel, with or without him, we gotta go!

18:45.280 --> 18:47.720
Sir, you've got company.

18:53.600 --> 18:57.080
At least ten men heading your way.
We're laying down cover fire.

19:05.680 --> 19:07.640
(moaning)

19:23.560 --> 19:26.280
(Carter overradio)
Colonel, come in. Over.

19:31.120 --> 19:33.320
Colonel, do you read? Come in. Over.

19:43.240 --> 19:46.960
Chaka must have grabbed that
from my vest before it was taken away.

19:47.080 --> 19:50.120
- Why would he do that?
- He's seen me using it.

19:50.240 --> 19:52.040
Chaka.

19:53.920 --> 19:56.320
- Give.
- Ko?

19:56.880 --> 19:59.040
"Ko". I don't know that word.

20:00.680 --> 20:03.560
"Ko", it's give. Yes, yes, Chaka. Ko, ko.

20:13.720 --> 20:15.200
Thank you.

20:15.880 --> 20:19.000
- Aka.
- Aka. Thank you.

20:19.360 --> 20:20.680
Daniel.

20:21.040 --> 20:23.000
Right.

20:24.200 --> 20:27.520
- Sam, it's Daniel. Do you read?
- Daniel, are you OK?

20:27.640 --> 20:30.520
- Uh, been better.
- Colonel O'Neill?

20:32.600 --> 20:37.040
Physically fine, but I'm not expecting
a birthday present any time soon.

20:37.160 --> 20:38.880
Ko.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.160
Ko.

20:42.240 --> 20:44.160
Chaka.

20:45.160 --> 20:47.120
Ko.

21:05.800 --> 21:07.760
Thank you.

21:09.520 --> 21:11.680
Carter. Report.

21:11.800 --> 21:17.000
There were too many ofthem, sir.
You ordered us not to shoot to kill.

21:17.120 --> 21:20.320
- Yeah, I know.
- We're being pursued by a search party.

21:20.440 --> 21:23.920
Attempting to make it
to the gate to get reinforcements.

21:24.560 --> 21:26.360
Roger that. Out.

21:30.360 --> 21:32.280
Daniel.

21:32.400 --> 21:36.000
- Chaka.
- Chaka.

21:39.640 --> 21:41.600
Aka na.

21:41.720 --> 21:44.520
Ma. Ma kan.

21:46.960 --> 21:50.240
Aka na. Keka.

21:50.520 --> 21:53.560
- Ma! Kan.
- Aka na.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.480
Kan cha na.

22:05.280 --> 22:07.000
Chaka.

22:09.760 --> 22:11.720
Chaka.

22:13.480 --> 22:15.560
What's he saying?

22:17.280 --> 22:20.320
Actually, it means a lot of different things.

22:20.440 --> 22:22.640
In this particular case, I'd say...

22:23.680 --> 22:27.720
"Thank you for trying to free me.
Sorry for getting you into this mess."

22:29.040 --> 22:31.000
Chaka.

22:31.720 --> 22:34.680
Chaka full of nuts. Whatever.

22:35.360 --> 22:38.080
- Jack, it's not his fault.
- Daniel...

22:38.200 --> 22:41.800
I'm chained up in a madman's barn
with a bunch of Unas.

22:41.920 --> 22:46.280
Who's to blame is not at the top
of my list of concerns... just yet.

22:50.320 --> 22:51.400
Chaka.

22:54.120 --> 22:55.760
Chaka.

23:00.080 --> 23:02.200
Chaka.

23:04.920 --> 23:07.400
- That's amazing.
- What?

23:07.600 --> 23:09.680
Language is a learned behaviour.

23:10.760 --> 23:13.720
Chaka must have taught
this Unas this word.

23:19.200 --> 23:20.280
Chaka.

23:20.880 --> 23:22.840
Chaka.

23:23.800 --> 23:25.680
Chaka zo.

23:26.320 --> 23:28.120
Chaka zo.

23:33.040 --> 23:36.240
(growling)

23:42.200 --> 23:44.160
(growling continues)

23:46.240 --> 23:50.720
They're saying Chaka is their leader. They
recognise he wouldn't leave without them.

23:50.840 --> 23:55.960
Daniel, dogs sniff each other's butts
and they're friends for life.

23:56.080 --> 23:59.480
- We still keep them as pets.
- No. No, this is different.

24:00.960 --> 24:02.880
Chaka made a choice.

24:03.000 --> 24:08.440
Choice is freedom. These Unas pledged
their allegiance to him because of that.

24:08.520 --> 24:10.680
- What are you saying?
- They wanna be free.

24:10.800 --> 24:12.720
They recognise what that means.

24:12.840 --> 24:15.800
- All they said was "Chaka zo".
- Chaka zo.

24:15.880 --> 24:18.600
Chaka zo.

24:18.680 --> 24:20.880
(Daniel) Chaka isn't different.

24:22.200 --> 24:26.920
These Unas were born into domestication
but they know freedom enough to want it.

24:27.120 --> 24:30.640
- You said this is their way of life here.
- Well, it has to change.

24:30.760 --> 24:33.120
How?

24:33.240 --> 24:35.400
We've meddled in other cultures before.

24:35.520 --> 24:38.320
Well, now you're talking
about moving in an army.

24:38.560 --> 24:41.600
I'd like to think
that there was another way.

24:41.680 --> 24:45.240
Look, in principle, I agree with you.

24:59.920 --> 25:01.800
You injured my father.

25:08.840 --> 25:10.800
I'm sorry.

25:11.320 --> 25:12.960
I really am.

25:17.560 --> 25:21.520
We were just trying to take back
an Unas that's rightfully ours.

25:23.760 --> 25:26.200
Stealing is wrong.

25:26.320 --> 25:28.600
Yes. It is.

25:40.360 --> 25:42.320
Chaka.

25:47.200 --> 25:49.360
Chaka.

26:00.320 --> 26:04.760
Trust me. A whole lotta people are gonna
have to die before one Unas goes free.

26:22.200 --> 26:24.160
Colonel, do you read?

26:26.800 --> 26:30.480
- Yeah. What's your situation?
- We're at the gate, sir, but it's guarded.

26:30.600 --> 26:34.800
- Ifwe attempt to get through, it'll get ugly.
- Hold your position.

26:34.880 --> 26:36.840
Radio silence. Gotta go.

26:53.840 --> 26:56.800
Beast stealing is punishable by death.

26:59.320 --> 27:02.520
But it is my hope
that that will not be necessary.

27:03.840 --> 27:05.800
But that will be up to you.

27:08.520 --> 27:12.800
I also know there were others with you
and that they may try to rescue you.

27:12.880 --> 27:16.200
That would not be wise.
I will not hesitate to kill you.

27:16.600 --> 27:18.560
What do you want?

27:25.640 --> 27:28.200
Tell me of the places
where the Chaapa-ai can go.

27:31.200 --> 27:34.920
I do not understand why you
take such risks for this beast.

27:35.040 --> 27:38.800
He is very valuable to me, but you can
replace him with one of equal lineage.

27:38.920 --> 27:40.960
Because they're not beasts.

27:41.800 --> 27:44.440
They're self-aware, intelligent beings,

27:44.520 --> 27:48.400
and you have no right to use them
as slaves or treat them like you do.

27:48.600 --> 27:52.720
They used our forefathers as slaves and
treated them worse than we do our Unas.

27:52.880 --> 27:55.760
- And that makes you right?
- What would you have us do?

27:56.080 --> 27:58.160
- Free them.
- (Burrock laughs)

27:59.840 --> 28:02.080
Untrained, uncontrolled?

28:02.200 --> 28:04.840
A beast would rip me
limb from limb, eat me alive.

28:04.960 --> 28:07.200
Then send them to their home world.

28:07.320 --> 28:11.680
Our forefathers could have slaughtered
them all, wiped them from the planet.

28:11.760 --> 28:15.200
But, instead, they saw a way
to use their strength to our advantage.

28:15.560 --> 28:17.920
A way to coexist. For that, we thank them.

28:18.040 --> 28:21.000
You don't coexist.
You use them as slaves.

28:21.120 --> 28:24.840
Look. We're not gonna tell you anything,
so you might as well let us go.

28:24.960 --> 28:29.400
We'll go back to where we came from,
you can go on doing what you do so well.

28:30.400 --> 28:33.600
Because now I know for certain
there is more out there.

28:33.680 --> 28:36.480
Yeah, I know the grass
always looks cleaner.

28:36.600 --> 28:39.320
But a bunch of bad guys
with glowing eyes are out there,

28:39.400 --> 28:41.600
and you really don't
wanna mess with them.

28:50.240 --> 28:52.240
(screams)

28:53.680 --> 28:56.800
- Teal'c!
- I will not continue to do nothing.

28:56.920 --> 28:58.880
What are you gonna do? Teal'c!

29:00.760 --> 29:03.040
Stop it! He's not gonna tell you anything!

29:11.960 --> 29:13.120
(screams)

29:13.400 --> 29:15.200
Chaka keka!

29:16.680 --> 29:19.560
(roaring)

29:19.640 --> 29:20.760
Quiet!

29:22.520 --> 29:25.320
(roaring)

29:25.440 --> 29:27.400
Quiet down!

29:28.480 --> 29:30.440
Quiet!

29:31.640 --> 29:33.720
Quiet!

29:51.240 --> 29:52.960
- Ka keka!
- No!

29:53.040 --> 29:55.000
(gun clicks)

30:00.880 --> 30:03.200
Impressive weapon.

30:03.320 --> 30:05.520
But not as efficient as a fire stick.

30:06.520 --> 30:10.080
It seems to stop working
after it's been fired for a while.

30:10.880 --> 30:12.840
I assume...

30:13.680 --> 30:15.840
that's what these are for.

30:16.080 --> 30:19.280
- Tell me how to make it work again.
- Give it to me, I'll show you.

30:21.760 --> 30:24.800
It was simple enough
to learn how to shoot it.

30:24.920 --> 30:27.240
I will learn this part on my own as well.

30:27.360 --> 30:30.320
In the meantime,
hunger and thirst will weaken you.

30:30.440 --> 30:34.040
Perhaps tomorrow you will
tell me what I want to know.

30:40.320 --> 30:42.280
I do not understand why,

30:44.240 --> 30:49.040
but it seems that you care for beasts more
than you care for your own wellbeing.

30:49.160 --> 30:50.880
So be it.

30:51.000 --> 30:54.360
Every morning and night, I will
come here to learn what you know.

30:54.480 --> 30:58.240
If you do not tell me... I will kill a beast.

30:59.440 --> 31:02.000
It may cost me.

31:02.080 --> 31:04.200
But I believe it may be worth it.

31:11.840 --> 31:13.480
Until tonight.

31:33.080 --> 31:37.520
Maybe we could take out those four guys,
but then dozens more'd be all over us.

31:37.640 --> 31:40.440
Then we'd have to get through the gate.

31:40.520 --> 31:42.480
A diversion.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.160
Yeah, Carter. I got you.

32:00.160 --> 32:02.880
Sir, what's yourstatus?
We heard shooting.

32:05.800 --> 32:08.280
We're all right. One of the Unas took a hit.

32:09.040 --> 32:11.280
- (Carter) Chaka?
- No, he's OK.

32:12.880 --> 32:15.200
I told you to hold your position at the gate.

32:15.320 --> 32:18.560
Yes, sir. Teal'c thinks we can
create a big enough distraction

32:18.680 --> 32:20.640
to attempt a rescue, and I agree.

32:20.760 --> 32:23.040
But we can't guarantee zero casualties.

32:23.160 --> 32:26.440
Ifthat's still your concern,
please advise. Over.

32:26.560 --> 32:28.800
I don't think we can
talk our way out of this.

32:28.920 --> 32:31.200
For once, I'm not asking us to.

32:33.120 --> 32:36.160
- Damn it, Daniel.
- Let's get outta here.

32:38.800 --> 32:40.760
All of us.

32:54.520 --> 32:57.160
Sir, still awaiting your orders.

32:57.960 --> 33:01.280
Yeah. We've got three Unas
who are gonna be joining us.

33:02.320 --> 33:04.280
Do what you have to do, Carter.

33:14.160 --> 33:16.280
You! Leave it!

33:17.640 --> 33:19.600
Come here!

34:04.360 --> 34:07.800
Quick! Water! Before the fire
spreads to the buildings!

34:27.679 --> 34:28.679
Get him!

34:48.120 --> 34:50.679
- Where's Teal'c?
- Trying to be popular.

35:16.160 --> 35:18.720
- Stand back!
- Keka!

35:19.840 --> 35:21.800
Keka.

35:31.480 --> 35:32.880
Come on, come on.

35:32.960 --> 35:35.920
Ka cha. Ka cha!

35:46.480 --> 35:48.560
- Stop!
- Hey!

36:17.600 --> 36:19.560
Chaka!

36:20.560 --> 36:22.280
It's OK. Chaka.

36:22.360 --> 36:24.720
Ka-nay. Friend.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.320
Friend.

36:45.720 --> 36:48.600
I thought you said
the gate was heavily guarded.

36:48.680 --> 36:51.560
The men may have gone
to town to help put out the fire.

36:51.640 --> 36:53.600
Or we got an ambush here.

36:56.040 --> 36:58.120
Hey, hey! Stop.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.880
Keka! Chaka!

37:03.080 --> 37:04.400
Keka!

37:09.160 --> 37:11.720
I think he understands why we stopped.

37:11.840 --> 37:14.200
All right. Fan out. Cover 'em.

37:44.440 --> 37:45.920
Chaka!

38:28.920 --> 38:31.320
(Daniel) Chaka! No!

38:31.720 --> 38:33.680
(fires)

38:49.840 --> 38:52.560
Chaka.

38:54.400 --> 38:56.720
Chaka.

38:57.040 --> 38:59.600
We're all clear, sir.
Teal'c's dialling the gate.

38:59.680 --> 39:02.640
We should hurry.
There might be more men coming.

39:04.040 --> 39:06.000
Chaka!

39:07.200 --> 39:09.160
Come on. We're taking you home.

39:15.760 --> 39:19.040
- No-na.
- No-na. Home.

39:20.440 --> 39:22.720
- Aka.
- No-na!

39:23.000 --> 39:26.440
Ko. Aka. Kek.

39:26.880 --> 39:28.840
We did all this to save you.

39:28.960 --> 39:31.760
Aka. Kek.

39:32.880 --> 39:34.840
He never intended to come with us.

39:34.960 --> 39:38.360
Ska nat. Ka keka.

39:41.000 --> 39:44.440
- He thought he was helping us escape.
- So what does he wanna do?

39:44.560 --> 39:47.760
Stay and fight, and free the others.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.960
Daniel, we didn't come here to arm them.

39:52.720 --> 39:54.680
They did that themselves.

39:55.960 --> 39:58.600
I don't think we're gonna stop them.

40:06.040 --> 40:08.000
Ka kek.

40:08.880 --> 40:12.160
Ska. Ka kek.

40:23.400 --> 40:26.520
- Chaka.
- Chaka.

40:41.320 --> 40:43.280
You just sent him out to start a war.

40:43.400 --> 40:45.360
It was his choice.

40:47.360 --> 40:49.360
I told him they didn't have to kill.

40:49.480 --> 40:51.520
Do you think he understands that?

40:52.760 --> 40:56.520
They know what freedom is
and they're willing to fight for it.

40:57.840 --> 40:59.800
They deserve a chance.

41:57.280 --> 41:59.200
