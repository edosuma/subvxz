00:03.383 --> 00:05.476
<i>Threat level-</i>
<i>Foxtrot Alpha Six.</i>

00:05.552 --> 00:07.747
<i>All security teams</i>
<i>to the gate room.</i>

00:17.130 --> 00:18.620
Give me your weapon.

01:18.425 --> 01:21.053
Simulation time-
49 seconds?

01:21.928 --> 01:23.862
It's not bad, not bad.

01:23.930 --> 01:26.125
How was it?
Was it fun?

01:26.199 --> 01:29.794
Indeed. You died well
in battle, O'Neill.

01:32.105 --> 01:34.767
Obviously, there's something
defective with this thing.

01:34.841 --> 01:36.331
Agreed.

01:36.410 --> 01:40.779
An Anubis drone is a far more formidable
warrior than this simulation suggests.

01:40.847 --> 01:44.339
What? Look, we've been
working on this chair for two years...

01:44.418 --> 01:48.411
to make it a viable virtual reality
training tool for SGC personnel.

01:48.488 --> 01:49.750
You have failed.

01:51.958 --> 01:54.256
He's nothing if not honest.

01:54.327 --> 01:59.094
Well, I mean, maybe we could-
It could use a little more work, but-

01:59.166 --> 02:02.602
Can you make it harder-
more difficult?

02:02.669 --> 02:07.402
Well, I mean, we can input the parameters
for different scenarios...

02:07.474 --> 02:12.070
but the vast majority of the simulation
array comes from the mind of the user.

02:12.145 --> 02:14.340
The programming is actually built...

02:14.414 --> 02:18.145
by interfacing memories
from the individual's consciousness...

02:18.218 --> 02:20.277
with the chair's matrix.

02:21.855 --> 02:26.485
Carter, all I heard was "matrix",
and I found those films quite confusing.

02:26.560 --> 02:28.721
I think what Dr. Lee
is trying to explain...

02:28.795 --> 02:33.027
is that the simulation actually learns
its realism from the person using it.

02:33.099 --> 02:34.999
- What?
- Yeah. No, we built it...

02:35.068 --> 02:38.299
we tested the software extensively
using a variety of subjects...

02:39.272 --> 02:41.797
obviously no one
with Teal'c's field experience.

02:41.875 --> 02:45.641
Subjects?
To whom do you refer?

02:46.346 --> 02:47.870
Well-

02:55.288 --> 03:00.385
Hey, ifTeal'c would agree
to work with us a little more-

03:00.460 --> 03:04.658
Look, all you'd have to do is basically
just play the game, let it learn from you.

03:04.731 --> 03:06.858
Oh, come on, it'd be fun.
You'd be so good.

03:09.069 --> 03:10.559
Very well.

03:11.538 --> 03:12.971
There you go.

03:13.740 --> 03:16.641
Just make sure there's a beginner's level
for the rest of us.

03:16.710 --> 03:18.302
Oh, yeah, we can always
make it easier.

03:18.378 --> 03:21.313
Not that we'd have to for you,
certainly.

03:21.381 --> 03:25.579
I mean, for others, but you'd be fine.

03:27.554 --> 03:29.249
Carter.
Gentlemen.

04:41.161 --> 04:43.959
Thanks to Colonel Carter's
new code translation program...

04:44.030 --> 04:46.362
we can actually
monitor your progress...

04:46.433 --> 04:49.493
through a graphic representation
of your point of view.

04:49.569 --> 04:51.059
You've played Doom.

04:51.738 --> 04:53.433
I played DefJam Vendetta.

04:53.506 --> 04:54.996
Exactly, yes.

04:55.075 --> 04:57.202
Now, there is a two-second delay...

04:57.277 --> 05:00.269
between the chair's processor
and your perceived experience...

05:00.347 --> 05:04.579
but... well, I mean,
you shouldn't notice anything.

05:04.651 --> 05:08.382
Anyway, we can store every aspect
of your activity in the game...

05:08.455 --> 05:10.685
and then later choose what
we're going to incorporate...

05:10.757 --> 05:13.282
into our programming
of the training scenario.

05:13.360 --> 05:15.851
Oh, you understand, as before...

05:15.929 --> 05:18.727
once your mind is interfaced
with the chair...

05:18.798 --> 05:20.663
we cannot forcibly
remove the connection...

05:20.734 --> 05:22.998
or cut power to the chair
without endangering you.

05:23.069 --> 05:25.094
Indeed.

05:25.171 --> 05:26.934
It's a function of the new chair design.

05:27.007 --> 05:30.204
Since the whole Gamekeeper incident,
the aliens of P7J-989...

05:30.276 --> 05:32.767
built the shutoff command
into the internal programming...

05:32.846 --> 05:34.780
so only someone in the chair
can control it.

05:34.848 --> 05:37.715
You have previously given me
this information, Colonel Carter.

05:37.784 --> 05:39.445
This is a little different this time...

05:39.519 --> 05:41.384
because the game will actually
be learning from you...

05:41.454 --> 05:45.015
and then incorporating those changes
into its programming code.

05:45.091 --> 05:46.581
If you're killed in the game...

05:46.660 --> 05:48.821
it will reset and you'll
automatically start again.

05:48.895 --> 05:52.160
The chair will only disconnect
and end the game under two conditions-

05:52.232 --> 05:55.998
once you complete the scenario
or if you engage the internal fail-safe...

05:56.069 --> 05:58.128
which, of course,
you're free to do at any time.

05:58.204 --> 06:00.195
That will be unnecessary.

06:02.642 --> 06:05.577
Don't be so cocky, Teal'c.
The chair is intuitive.

06:05.645 --> 06:07.738
It's eventually gonna learn
everything you know.

06:07.814 --> 06:10.715
Now, if you wanna stop it
before the conclusion of the simulation...

06:10.784 --> 06:14.185
just get to the base elevator,
head for the surface.

06:14.254 --> 06:15.744
Ready?

06:15.822 --> 06:17.312
Proceed.

06:31.337 --> 06:33.805
<i>Threat level-</i>
<i>Foxtrot Alpha Six.</i>

06:33.873 --> 06:36.171
<i>All security teams to the gate room.</i>

06:44.718 --> 06:46.276
Give me your weapon.

07:01.401 --> 07:03.130
What just happened?

07:03.203 --> 07:06.832
It looks like the chair induced
a pain response when he was killed.

07:07.741 --> 07:10.676
It's directly linked to his brain.
We knew it was capable of this.

07:10.744 --> 07:14.339
Yeah, but it's just a simulation.
It doesn't have to hurt.

07:14.414 --> 07:16.746
Yeah, see, that's the difference
between you and Teal'c.

07:16.816 --> 07:19.717
He knows that in a real situation your
tactics would be completely different...

07:19.786 --> 07:21.720
if you thought you couldn't
feel any pain.

07:22.489 --> 07:24.616
Man, that was a heck of a shock.

07:25.458 --> 07:27.255
He'd want it to be realistic.

07:30.563 --> 07:33.327
Well, fortunately we limited the chair
from being able to deliver...

07:33.399 --> 07:35.765
any sort of lethal jolt.

07:40.840 --> 07:43.400
<i>Threat level-</i>
<i>Foxtrot Alpha Six.</i>

07:43.476 --> 07:45.671
<i>All security teams to the gate room.</i>

08:27.053 --> 08:28.680
Get out of here, Teal'c.

08:37.297 --> 08:38.787
That's twice.

08:38.865 --> 08:41.026
Looks like the chair
is learning quickly.

08:41.100 --> 08:42.624
Don't count Teal'c out yet.

09:50.870 --> 09:52.701
Ooh, that's cold.

09:55.808 --> 10:00.006
Colonel, I'm pretty concerned
about some of these bioreadings.

10:00.079 --> 10:01.569
Me too.

10:05.485 --> 10:09.148
Dr. Carmichael, this is Colonel Carter.
Can you join us in Science Lab 5?

10:09.923 --> 10:12.323
<i>Threat level-</i>
<i>Foxtrot Alpha Six.</i>

10:12.392 --> 10:14.417
<i>All security teams to the gate room.</i>

10:18.831 --> 10:20.628
Colonel Carter, I require your assistance.

10:20.700 --> 10:22.190
Likewise. SG-3 came in hot.

10:22.268 --> 10:24.293
Sounds like our gate room people
could use a little backup.

10:24.370 --> 10:26.736
- They are all dead.
- Excuse me?

10:26.806 --> 10:28.330
The gate room has been breached.

10:28.408 --> 10:32.310
Our most effective defense will be to seal
off the east and south ends of Level 28.

10:32.378 --> 10:34.938
If we act now, we may be able
to force them into a cross fire.

10:35.014 --> 10:37.414
- Force who?
- The two Anubis warriors.

10:37.483 --> 10:39.178
How the hell can you know that?

10:39.252 --> 10:42.744
Because they have chosen the same route
seven of the last 10 times.

11:01.441 --> 11:04.171
<i>Colonel, we have two hostiles</i>
<i>headed your way.</i>

11:04.243 --> 11:06.837
Roger that. We're in position.
Heads up, people.

11:26.933 --> 11:29.026
Fall back!

11:53.326 --> 11:56.727
Well, you were right to be
concerned about these readings.

11:56.796 --> 11:59.663
Frequent sympathetic spikes
in his natural adrenaline production...

11:59.732 --> 12:01.996
are causing blood pressure
and heart rate way too high...

12:02.068 --> 12:03.558
to be sustained over the long term.

12:03.636 --> 12:07.163
That last ambush should have worked.
Why did the energy weapon have no effect?

12:07.240 --> 12:08.730
I don't know.

12:08.808 --> 12:11.003
Have you ever known a Super Soldier
to be resistant...

12:11.077 --> 12:13.204
to the weapon like that in reality?

12:13.279 --> 12:14.803
But it's possible, right?

12:14.881 --> 12:17.406
We've seen situations where the Goa'uld
have adapted their technology...

12:17.483 --> 12:19.974
to defend against something
we've thrown at them.

12:20.053 --> 12:24.251
Well, hopefully the game will also
extrapolate possible solutions...

12:24.323 --> 12:25.950
and offer them to Teal'c.

12:28.861 --> 12:30.726
Well, I mean, it'd just be fair.

12:32.098 --> 12:34.123
<i>Threat level-</i>
<i>Foxtrot Alpha Six.</i>

12:34.200 --> 12:37.260
- <i>All security teams to the gate room.</i>
- Teal'c, SG-3 came in hot.

12:37.336 --> 12:39.531
Sounds like the gate room people
could use some backup.

12:41.174 --> 12:42.607
We've gotta move!

12:42.675 --> 12:44.302
Colonel Carter, listen to me.

12:44.377 --> 12:47.073
The SGC has been penetrated
by two Anubis drones.

12:47.146 --> 12:49.080
Our weapons are now ineffective
against their armor.

12:49.148 --> 12:50.911
- How could you-
- How is this possible?

12:50.983 --> 12:53.417
- That's what I wanna know.
- I am speaking of the armor.

12:53.486 --> 12:56.717
It could have been altered to resist
the effectiveness of the energy weapon.

12:56.789 --> 12:57.949
Can they now be defeated?

12:58.024 --> 13:00.618
I've been working on
a frequency modulator chip.

13:00.693 --> 13:02.786
- Where is it?
- In my lab, but I still don't-

13:05.064 --> 13:06.554
Show me.

13:13.072 --> 13:14.596
It's only a prototype.

13:26.152 --> 13:30.111
<i>Warning! Base autodestruct</i>
<i>sequence has been activated.</i>

13:42.101 --> 13:44.433
- Nice of you to join us!
- We've been busy.

13:45.204 --> 13:47.695
They've found a way to counteract
our little weapons here.

13:56.949 --> 14:01.352
<i>Warning! Base autodestruct sequence</i>
<i>has been activated.</i>

14:01.420 --> 14:04.048
<i>Thirty seconds to detonation.</i>

14:10.129 --> 14:14.259
- <i>Base autodestruct has been aborted.</i>
- We're clear.

14:14.934 --> 14:17.129
Then the threat has been eliminated.

14:22.175 --> 14:24.268
The threat has been eliminated.

14:29.081 --> 14:30.548
Teal'c, you're injured.

14:36.355 --> 14:37.913
I'm fine.

14:39.926 --> 14:44.192
- I don't get it. That should be the end.
- You're saying he should have won.

14:44.263 --> 14:47.755
Well, that was the conclusion
of the originally programmed scenario.

14:47.833 --> 14:49.266
The chair is not disconnecting.

14:49.335 --> 14:52.168
And the game's not resetting
to the beginning either.

14:52.238 --> 14:55.537
That's not fair. You can't win a race
if someone keeps moving the finish line.

14:56.809 --> 15:00.176
He said he wanted it to be harder,
more realistic.

15:01.414 --> 15:03.712
In reality,
we haven't defeated the Goa'uld.

15:04.483 --> 15:07.350
Are you saying the game won't end
until he defeats all the Goa'uld?

15:07.420 --> 15:10.821
You tell me. You said the game
was learning the rules from Teal'c.

15:10.890 --> 15:14.189
Yeah, but the parameters can't go beyond
the base invasion scenario.

15:15.494 --> 15:16.927
Can you get him out?

15:16.996 --> 15:19.226
Not without risking
serious neural damage.

15:19.966 --> 15:23.129
The game has a fail-safe.
All Teal'c has to do is quit.

15:24.470 --> 15:26.938
Yeah. Teal'c quit.

15:32.345 --> 15:34.643
Anubis drones must have waited
for SG-3 to dial the gate...

15:34.714 --> 15:36.614
and then overwhelmed them
at the last minute.

15:36.682 --> 15:39.913
What I can't figure out is how they knew
how to set the base self-destruct.

15:39.986 --> 15:41.977
I can't believe General O'Neill
is really dead.

15:42.054 --> 15:44.488
- He is not dead.
- What?

15:45.958 --> 15:50.054
We must focus on the situation.
The threat has not been neutralized.

15:53.833 --> 15:56.734
- What?
- We will search the base immediately.

15:56.802 --> 15:59.066
More warriors remain.

15:59.739 --> 16:00.899
What?

16:00.973 --> 16:05.342
He also knew the Super Soldiers' armor
was resistant to our energy weapons.

16:05.411 --> 16:08.847
Sergeant Harriman reported that there were
only two intruders before he got killed.

16:09.615 --> 16:12.413
They held the control room long enough to
keep the iris open and let others through.

16:12.485 --> 16:15.454
Maybe, but the logs would have indicated
there was another incoming wormhole.

16:15.521 --> 16:18.456
The threat has not been neutralized.

16:19.859 --> 16:22.453
There are others.
I am certain of it.

16:22.528 --> 16:24.086
Because?

16:24.163 --> 16:26.256
The game has not yet ended.

16:32.271 --> 16:35.763
I know this isn't your strongest suit,
but this is a really bad time for jokes.

16:38.210 --> 16:40.610
You are all part of a simulation...

16:40.680 --> 16:44.946
designed to test the SGC's preparedness
in case of gate breach.

16:46.319 --> 16:48.514
None of you are real.

16:55.061 --> 16:56.824
I am fine.

16:57.663 --> 17:01.656
<i>Warning! Base autodestruct sequence</i>
<i>has been activated.</i>

17:18.617 --> 17:20.016
Sam?

17:20.086 --> 17:21.576
I don't understand it.

17:21.654 --> 17:24.885
Somebody must have reactivated
the autodestruct from a remote location.

17:29.729 --> 17:31.822
I'm locked out of the system.
I can't shut it down.

17:33.699 --> 17:35.223
How did you know?

17:38.237 --> 17:40.398
His heart rate and blood pressure
are too high.

17:40.473 --> 17:42.031
How long can he do this?

17:42.108 --> 17:44.736
I don't know, a day, maybe less.

17:44.810 --> 17:46.937
I thought the chair wasn't
supposed to be able to kill him?

17:47.012 --> 17:50.038
The physiological effects
it can have at any one time are limited.

17:50.116 --> 17:52.050
Yes, but I'm afraid that...

17:52.118 --> 17:54.916
while each individual pain stimulus
isn't in any way life-threatening...

17:54.987 --> 17:58.286
the cumulative effect
is now starting to take its toll.

17:58.357 --> 18:00.791
If he doesn't have a heart attack,
he'll eventually run out of adrenaline.

18:00.860 --> 18:03.055
His heart will slow down.
His blood pressure will drop.

18:03.129 --> 18:05.188
His entire organ system
is gonna fail.

18:05.264 --> 18:07.459
Death by a thousand cuts.

18:11.003 --> 18:12.971
You must disable
the autodestruct command.

18:13.038 --> 18:14.198
What?

18:14.273 --> 18:16.400
The SGC will be breached
by Anubis warriors.

18:16.475 --> 18:19.638
They will attempt to destroy the base
via the autodestruct command.

18:19.712 --> 18:22.340
- What are you talking about?
- If you disable the command...

18:22.415 --> 18:25.043
they'll be forced to use other
means to achieve their goal.

18:25.117 --> 18:29.144
- Only then can we hope to defeat them.
- Teal'c, how could you possibly know-

18:29.822 --> 18:32.154
<i>Threat level-</i>
<i>Foxtrot Alpha Six.</i>

18:32.224 --> 18:34.715
<i>All security teams to the gate room.</i>

18:34.794 --> 18:36.489
There is little time.

18:39.064 --> 18:40.122
Colonel.

18:41.333 --> 18:42.823
He's at Level 28.

18:42.902 --> 18:44.631
He's already got the modulator chip...

18:44.703 --> 18:46.967
and he's used it to kill
the first two Super Soldiers.

18:47.039 --> 18:48.700
He's hunting for the third-

18:52.511 --> 18:54.638
Man, he's not in good shape.

19:16.101 --> 19:18.092
This is ridiculous.
It's torturing him.

19:18.170 --> 19:19.967
Why won't he quit?

19:21.774 --> 19:24.265
Wait a minute.
He's headed for the elevator.

19:24.343 --> 19:25.833
He's gonna use the fail-safe.

19:54.573 --> 19:56.973
<i>Threat level-</i>
<i>Foxtrot Alpha Six.</i>

19:57.042 --> 19:59.203
<i>All security teams to the gate room.</i>

20:11.423 --> 20:14.449
It didn't work.
He's back in the game.

20:28.007 --> 20:30.202
You know, I always thought
a fail-safe system...

20:30.276 --> 20:34.713
was supposed to be
somewhat safe from failure.

20:36.181 --> 20:37.842
From the beginning,
in Teal'c's mind...

20:37.917 --> 20:41.045
the goal was to make the simulation
as real as possible.

20:41.120 --> 20:43.088
As much as he must now wanna quit...

20:43.155 --> 20:45.248
we think the game
evaluated his character...

20:45.324 --> 20:47.724
and decided that
if this were a real situation...

20:47.793 --> 20:50.125
Teal'c would never give up
under any circumstances.

20:50.195 --> 20:53.562
Well, it's right.
It's also just a game.

20:53.632 --> 20:55.657
But the game doesn't know that.

20:59.104 --> 21:00.867
So how do we get him out?

21:00.940 --> 21:03.374
Removing the connections
while the system is operating...

21:03.442 --> 21:06.036
is very dangerous,
potentially fatal.

21:06.812 --> 21:08.370
On the other hand...

21:08.447 --> 21:10.415
the physical stress that
the chair is putting him under...

21:10.482 --> 21:11.949
will eventually kill him anyway.

21:13.352 --> 21:16.048
Right now, the only way out
is for Teal'c to win the game.

21:17.256 --> 21:18.484
Can he?

21:18.557 --> 21:20.388
It seems to be getting harder and harder.

21:20.459 --> 21:23.087
Every time it appears he's won,
the game adds a new twist.

21:24.029 --> 21:25.826
So it's not gonna let him win.

21:25.898 --> 21:30.130
No. The chair doesn't have an ego.
It's not trying to beat Teal'c.

21:30.202 --> 21:33.103
Just provide a challenge
that's worthy of his abilities.

21:33.172 --> 21:36.335
Ironically, it's Teal'c's ego that created
this problem in the first place...

21:37.076 --> 21:39.840
not that his self-image
isn't entirely accurate.

21:39.912 --> 21:45.179
If this continues, he's gonna require
adrenaline to sustain his heart rate.

21:45.250 --> 21:48.344
And the thing is, I can't keep him
going like this for long.

21:49.822 --> 21:51.722
There has to be a way
for him to win.

22:25.824 --> 22:29.624
- I think it's helping.
- Yeah. Yeah.

23:30.422 --> 23:32.549
- They've adapted their armor.
- Cover me.

23:42.134 --> 23:43.624
Colonel Carter.

23:53.145 --> 23:54.669
Teal'c, what's going on?

23:56.381 --> 23:58.508
What are you doing with
a thermographic sensor?

24:01.553 --> 24:03.043
There's a third drone.

24:03.122 --> 24:05.522
Are you sure?
I thought only two came through.

24:05.591 --> 24:09.027
I'm certain.
He is using a cloak of invisibility.

24:38.490 --> 24:40.117
Nice one.

24:40.192 --> 24:42.592
- And it is not yet over.
- There are more?

24:42.661 --> 24:44.322
<i>Colonel?</i>

24:44.396 --> 24:45.886
Go ahead.

24:45.964 --> 24:49.900
<i>Ma'am, I've got a problem with the</i>
<i>naquadah generator in Storage Room 28-F9.</i>

25:07.019 --> 25:08.646
I can't stop it.

25:09.521 --> 25:11.716
Someone's rigged it on a feedback loop.

25:20.632 --> 25:22.759
There's not enough time
to stop the overload.

25:25.704 --> 25:29.003
Sergeant, dial the gate now.
P4M-523.

25:29.074 --> 25:31.269
Yes, ma'am.
Starting dialing sequence.

25:37.416 --> 25:39.043
Chevron one encoded.

25:46.258 --> 25:48.021
Chevron two encoded.

25:53.098 --> 25:54.690
Chevron three encoded.

25:58.503 --> 25:59.993
Chevron four-

26:08.580 --> 26:11.481
Daniel?
What the hell are you doing?

26:21.326 --> 26:23.794
<i>Threat level-</i>
<i>Foxtrot Alpha Six.</i>

26:23.862 --> 26:26.092
<i>All security teams to the gate room.</i>

26:52.758 --> 26:56.819
<i>Warning! Base autodestruct</i>
<i>sequence has been activated.</i>

27:37.669 --> 27:40.035
- How's he doin'?
- Not well.

27:40.105 --> 27:43.268
His physical exhaustion's
translating into the game.

27:43.342 --> 27:47.540
It's like he's having trouble even playing
anymore. It still won't let him go.

27:48.981 --> 27:52.178
I spoke to one of
the scientists on P7J-989.

27:52.250 --> 27:55.447
He says there's nothing they can do
under the circumstances.

27:55.520 --> 27:57.283
What are you doing?

27:57.356 --> 28:00.086
They had a neural imprint
ofTeal'c's mind on file...

28:00.158 --> 28:02.456
from when we were trapped
in the chair six years ago.

28:03.328 --> 28:04.818
Creepy.

28:04.896 --> 28:06.955
Yeah. I'm trying
not to think about it.

28:07.733 --> 28:09.633
Anyway, I'm running
a simulation on this chair...

28:09.701 --> 28:12.135
using the same parameters
that Teal'c's dealing with now.

28:12.204 --> 28:13.364
And?

28:13.438 --> 28:17.238
Well, the imprint's nowhere near
the same as a live active mind.

28:17.309 --> 28:19.470
Plus, a lot has changed
in the last six years.

28:19.544 --> 28:21.603
Yeah, but not the essence
ofTeal'c's character.

28:22.514 --> 28:26.314
See, that's what worries me.
I hope it has.

28:26.385 --> 28:28.683
Now, I have run
hundreds of simulations.

28:28.754 --> 28:31.245
No matter what Teal'c does,
the programming adapts.

28:31.323 --> 28:34.486
Every time it looks like he's won,
the chair makes it harder.

28:35.360 --> 28:37.760
It's almost like the game
is reading Teal'c's mind...

28:37.829 --> 28:39.490
and somehow
seeing this one game...

28:39.564 --> 28:41.896
as a microcosm for
our war against the Goa'uld.

28:41.967 --> 28:44.697
Well, that's how Teal'c probably treats
every battle we fight with 'em.

28:44.770 --> 28:46.704
Well, according to these results...

28:46.772 --> 28:50.037
six years ago,
despite what Teal'c led us to believe...

28:50.108 --> 28:53.703
deep down, he didn't really think
the Goa'uld could ever be defeated.

28:53.779 --> 28:56.009
Well, he doesn't think that now.

28:57.449 --> 28:59.644
He can't, not after everything
we've accomplished.

28:59.718 --> 29:01.117
I hope you're right.

29:01.186 --> 29:04.883
Otherwise, no matter how long
or hard Teal'c plays the game...

29:05.557 --> 29:07.047
he won't win.

29:21.106 --> 29:22.937
This can't go on for much longer.

29:23.008 --> 29:26.535
We're gonna have to make a decision soon
about forcibly removing the connections.

29:28.046 --> 29:31.982
You know, it's too bad we can't
hook up a joystick to this thing...

29:32.050 --> 29:35.110
give him a little help,
a little backup, maybe.

29:35.187 --> 29:38.247
Actually, we could
link up another chair...

29:38.323 --> 29:40.553
and send someone else
into the same simulation.

29:41.793 --> 29:43.658
Oh. That wouldn't make any difference.

29:43.728 --> 29:47.596
The processors would network and the
second person would just fall victim...

29:47.666 --> 29:50.794
to the same altered elements in
the simulation that have trapped Teal'c.

29:51.570 --> 29:54.164
Unless the new player
had an advantage.

29:57.309 --> 29:58.799
Sir, you may have done it again.

30:00.078 --> 30:01.568
Yes.

30:02.481 --> 30:03.971
How'd I do it this time?

30:05.250 --> 30:09.414
These graphics are being generated by
a data recorder that's tracking the game.

30:09.488 --> 30:13.754
It's actually interfaced into the system
between the chair's processor and Teal'c.

30:13.825 --> 30:16.487
The chair decides what's
gonna happen, Teal'c responds.

30:16.561 --> 30:19.860
Those responses are then incorporated,
processed, and we see the results.

30:19.931 --> 30:22.991
It's a continuous loop
of ever-changing data.

30:23.068 --> 30:24.626
Oh.

30:25.971 --> 30:28.030
Still waitin' on my good idea.

30:28.106 --> 30:32.042
The recorder causes a two-second delay
between the programming in the chair...

30:32.110 --> 30:34.237
and the experience in Teal'c's mind.

30:34.312 --> 30:37.281
He won't know the difference,
but we could use it to our advantage.

30:37.349 --> 30:41.547
If we hook the second chair to the first
without using the recorder in the loop-

30:41.620 --> 30:43.747
The new player would know
what was about to happen in the game...

30:43.822 --> 30:45.722
two seconds before it occurred.

30:46.591 --> 30:48.354
- Like precognition.
- Exactly.

30:49.361 --> 30:50.851
It's not much...

30:50.929 --> 30:53.989
but it might give us enough of an edge
to help both players win.

30:54.065 --> 30:58.434
That's assuming the chair's programming
won't become aware of it and adapt.

30:58.503 --> 31:00.801
Which would mean that
there's a good chance...

31:00.872 --> 31:03.636
that the second player could be
trapped along with Teal'c.

31:03.708 --> 31:05.198
I'll do it.

31:12.050 --> 31:14.177
<i>Threat level-</i>
<i>Foxtrot Alpha Six.</i>

31:14.252 --> 31:16.516
<i>All security teams to the gate room.</i>

31:31.303 --> 31:33.999
What are you doing?
No, don't! Don't!

31:41.580 --> 31:43.070
Why'd he shoot him?

31:43.148 --> 31:46.117
Because Daniel was a Goa'uld
in the last several simulations.

31:47.786 --> 31:49.515
I told you I should have gone.

31:49.588 --> 31:52.853
The last thing we needed was the game
learning from your tactical experience.

31:59.864 --> 32:01.798
I gotta get used to this.

32:01.866 --> 32:04.494
<i>Threat level-</i>
<i>Foxtrot Alpha Six.</i>

32:04.569 --> 32:06.469
<i>All security teams to the gate room.</i>

32:31.863 --> 32:33.797
Easy. Don't shoot.

32:35.467 --> 32:37.094
Just hear me out.

32:37.168 --> 32:39.398
Okay, it's me. I'm real.

32:39.471 --> 32:41.905
I'm not a Goa'uld,
and I'm gonna prove that to you, okay?

32:47.746 --> 32:50.909
- Crap!
- <i>Threat level- Foxtrot Alpha Six.</i>

32:50.982 --> 32:53.143
<i>All security teams to the gate room.</i>

33:12.637 --> 33:14.935
I'm sorry, buddy.
You're gonna have to listen to me.

33:23.448 --> 33:26.906
Okay. Now a minute ago,
we were in Sam's lab.

33:26.985 --> 33:29.818
I was trying to convince you
I was real and you shot me, remember?

33:31.790 --> 33:33.314
What happened next?

33:34.626 --> 33:36.355
The game reset.

33:37.929 --> 33:40.591
I know. It's probably happened
so many times, it's just one big blur...

33:40.665 --> 33:43.600
but the reason it happened this time
is because I'm playing too.

33:45.770 --> 33:47.499
I'm in a chair, just like you.

33:48.473 --> 33:51.169
If either one of us die,
we both lose.

34:12.897 --> 34:14.421
It will not let me out.

34:14.499 --> 34:15.989
I know.

34:16.668 --> 34:19.865
The game thinks in a real
situation you'd never quit.

34:21.005 --> 34:23.269
No matter what I do...

34:23.341 --> 34:27.107
it is not possible, DanielJackson,
it is not possible.

34:27.178 --> 34:28.770
Yes, it is.

34:28.847 --> 34:30.405
That's why I'm here.

34:32.450 --> 34:35.078
Come on, let's do this...
together.

34:48.967 --> 34:52.198
- We must leave this area immediately.
- Yeah, I heard that.

34:57.542 --> 34:59.510
You possess the ability
to foresee the future?

34:59.577 --> 35:01.602
Yeah, two seconds in the future.

35:02.280 --> 35:05.113
To be honest with you,
it's kind of freaking me out.

35:06.017 --> 35:08.281
Two seconds is not a lot of time.

35:09.020 --> 35:14.322
I mean, just a chance to see
something happen and all I can say is...

35:15.593 --> 35:17.117
watch out.

35:17.896 --> 35:19.420
No, seriously, watch out!

35:30.675 --> 35:32.006
We're gonna need a crash cart in here.

35:32.076 --> 35:34.874
You can't introduce an electrical impulse
to the chair like that.

35:34.946 --> 35:36.436
He's right.

35:36.514 --> 35:38.948
There's a very good chance Teal'c
is gonna go into cardiac arrest...

35:39.017 --> 35:40.951
if he suffers one more reset.

36:04.709 --> 36:06.199
His heart's stopped.

36:13.918 --> 36:15.613
He's got a pulse.

36:17.655 --> 36:19.418
That's not gonna work again.

36:20.859 --> 36:22.724
I don't wanna see that again.

36:23.962 --> 36:25.987
I thought they were gonna
be able to beat this thing.

36:26.064 --> 36:29.295
It may take Daniel a while
to adjust to the precognitive abilities.

36:29.367 --> 36:31.494
Plus, two seconds
isn't a lot of time.

36:31.569 --> 36:34.060
He'll need the right opportunity
to take advantage of it.

36:48.620 --> 36:52.147
We must possess the modulator chip to
compensate for the drones' modified armor.

36:52.824 --> 36:56.225
- Any idea where she keeps it?
- It changes location each time.

36:56.294 --> 36:57.784
Of course it does.

37:01.065 --> 37:02.555
Found it!

37:07.472 --> 37:08.336
Down!

37:27.892 --> 37:29.382
Yeah.

37:29.460 --> 37:31.451
This could work.

38:08.833 --> 38:12.496
- Why didn't you shoot him?
- Such an action has always proven fatal.

38:13.905 --> 38:15.429
On a previous version of the game...

38:15.506 --> 38:18.339
when I've eliminated a drone
from this location...

38:18.409 --> 38:22.470
it has inevitably attracted the attention
of a third cloaked drone.

38:22.547 --> 38:24.481
So we'll shoot him too.

38:24.549 --> 38:27.245
It is merely a diversion designed
to allow a Goa'uld...

38:27.318 --> 38:29.650
hidden in our midst
enough time to destroy the base.

38:29.721 --> 38:32.315
He will use either our
self-destruct mechanism...

38:32.390 --> 38:34.722
or a naquadah generator
designed to overload.

38:34.792 --> 38:37.283
And if you try to stop one,
it uses the other.

38:37.362 --> 38:39.193
Indeed.

38:39.263 --> 38:41.527
I suppose the identity of
that Goa'uld always changes too.

38:42.300 --> 38:43.892
Yes.

38:43.968 --> 38:47.426
I believe it to be the final component
of the game we must overcome.

39:30.448 --> 39:32.746
- You guys all right?
- Oh, yeah. Thanks.

39:37.588 --> 39:39.078
The naquadah generator.

39:40.825 --> 39:42.315
You guys all right?

39:45.830 --> 39:47.661
Almost got it.
Just give me a second.

39:47.732 --> 39:49.859
Step away from the device.

39:49.934 --> 39:51.424
Teal'c, what are you doing?

39:51.502 --> 39:54.232
We've got less than a minute
before this thing goes critical.

40:00.411 --> 40:01.878
Step away.

40:03.748 --> 40:05.545
I'd do as he says.

40:18.129 --> 40:19.721
What the hell's goin' on here?

40:21.466 --> 40:24.299
Teal'c, we're all gonna die
if you don't let me stop that overload.

40:24.368 --> 40:26.461
She may be a Goa'uld.

40:26.537 --> 40:28.232
It was Siler.

40:32.710 --> 40:35.406
He was in here.
I found him setting the generator.

40:37.548 --> 40:40.073
Teal'c, put the weapon down.
That's an order.

40:42.286 --> 40:43.753
What if it's not her?

40:44.655 --> 40:47.715

40:48.493 --> 40:50.552

DanielJackson.

40:51.829 --> 40:53.922
Hey!

40:59.504 --> 41:01.233
Now what?

41:01.305 --> 41:03.967
Well, I know for a fact
it's not me or Teal'c.

41:16.687 --> 41:19.315
I don't know.
I can't tell.

42:21.219 --> 42:24.484

42:34.131 --> 42:35.621
Hey.

42:37.702 --> 42:39.363
We have won.

42:39.437 --> 42:40.927
Well...

42:42.306 --> 42:43.898
it's what we do.
