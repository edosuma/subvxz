Lee.Ee,
don doesn't think
there's a problem.

01:19.159 --> 01:22.328
Lee, those restrictions
aren't going to affect
lucky strike.

01:22.395 --> 01:24.763
Besides, Lee, your lawyers
came up with them.

01:24.831 --> 01:28.266
"no more smoking teenagers"...
we complied a year ago.

01:28.334 --> 01:30.468
"no more famous athletes"

01:30.535 --> 01:32.503
And we have to stop using
certain angles.

01:35.707 --> 01:37.307
Low angles, wide lenses...

01:37.374 --> 01:39.675
Anything that
makes the smoker
appear superhuman.

01:43.113 --> 01:45.578
- Why is this empty?
- Because you drank it all.

01:45.645 --> 01:48.011
- He can't hear you.
- There's kind of a loophole

01:48.078 --> 01:50.713
Because even
without athletes you
can still use sports.

01:50.780 --> 01:53.315
Bowling, for example,
seems a natural fit.

01:54.617 --> 01:56.350
Bowling is a sport, Lee.

01:56.418 --> 01:58.685
Well, how about
horse-racing?

02:00.688 --> 02:03.389
Lee. Lee,
the jockey smokes
the cigarette.

02:03.456 --> 02:05.523
Did either of you ladies
bring any ice with you?

02:05.591 --> 02:07.358
We're sorting out
the focus group for pond's

02:07.426 --> 02:08.925
And I haven't
gotten the hypothesis...

02:08.993 --> 02:10.693
- In writing anyway.
- He said "don."

02:12.797 --> 02:14.598
We'll do our best.

02:14.665 --> 02:17.467
- Peggy, write it up.
- You haven't okayed
the brief.

02:17.535 --> 02:19.602
I liked your idea.
I liked it a lot.

02:19.670 --> 02:21.036
The mirror one
or the cleansing one?

02:21.104 --> 02:22.571
What's the mirror one?

02:22.639 --> 02:24.872
Well, I think
it's about the ritual,

02:24.940 --> 02:27.975
The multiple applications,
indulgence.

02:28.043 --> 02:30.778
"pond's is
the only cold cream
that allows me"

02:30.845 --> 02:33.080
To stare at myself
in the mirror
for 20 minutes

02:33.147 --> 02:34.481
"And feel good
and not vain."

02:36.084 --> 02:37.851
That's very good.

02:40.655 --> 02:42.819
So we're talking
about girls 18 to 25.

02:42.887 --> 02:44.286
Can I grab a few
from around here?

02:44.354 --> 02:45.886
Yeah, help yourself.

02:45.954 --> 02:47.621
See, I would
never buy a sailboat.

02:47.689 --> 02:50.023
I don't want
to do things myself.

02:50.091 --> 02:52.625
<i>For that price,
that boat should
have a motor.</i>

02:52.693 --> 02:55.527
A what?

02:55.595 --> 02:58.130
- One of those too.
- Anything else?

03:01.267 --> 03:04.766
I don't know.
Why don't you ask
don about that?

03:04.834 --> 03:06.702
I have to go to
the little boys' room.

03:06.769 --> 03:09.571
I'm sorry, Lee,
can you go through that
one more time?

03:12.841 --> 03:16.109
That's the lucky strike call?
Why wasn't I told?

03:16.177 --> 03:18.077
Be happy.
I saved you an ass-ache.

03:23.816 --> 03:25.683
So what's so bad
he couldn't tell me?

03:25.751 --> 03:28.085
Cal Rutledge from
Chesebrough-pond's

03:28.153 --> 03:30.086
Has a wild hair
about Clearasil.

03:30.154 --> 03:31.888
He thinks they're in conflict.

03:31.955 --> 03:33.723
Pimple cream and cold cream?

03:33.790 --> 03:36.958
- That's a rather
broad definition.
- Does it matter?

03:37.026 --> 03:39.994
Look, Pete, we're
going to have to resign
the Clearasil account.

03:41.463 --> 03:43.731
- Why?
- Lane.

03:43.798 --> 03:45.532
It can't be up for debate.

03:45.600 --> 03:48.334
Clearasil is worth
$1.25 million in billings

03:48.402 --> 03:51.003
- And pond's over two.
- No.

03:51.070 --> 03:53.171
Do you know what it took
to get my father-in-law

03:53.239 --> 03:54.706
To join this new firm
to begin with?

03:54.773 --> 03:57.874
15% of $750,000

03:57.942 --> 04:00.509
Is near $113,000.

04:00.577 --> 04:03.412
Roger, I don't expect him
to understand this,

04:03.480 --> 04:06.347
But do you have any idea
of what I've had to do
to keep that account?

04:06.415 --> 04:08.282
The personal toll I've paid?

04:08.350 --> 04:10.783
I do, but you've
been good to him...

04:10.851 --> 04:12.551
Remember that...
saleswise.

04:12.619 --> 04:15.220
<i>- Mr. Sterling.
- I don't believe this.</i>

04:15.288 --> 04:18.723
- Roger.
- Throw yourself
on the grenade.

04:18.791 --> 04:20.791
Protect the agency.
You're a partner now.

04:22.594 --> 04:24.094
This evening if you can.

04:28.099 --> 04:30.333
Over half this agency is
dedicated to your needs,

04:30.401 --> 04:32.468
But if you want to get
into the line-by-line

04:32.536 --> 04:34.136
Of the costs we've billed for,

04:34.204 --> 04:36.538
I'll have lane Pryce
at the foot of your bed
in 20 minutes.

04:37.940 --> 04:39.741
Oh my God,
there's some kind of fire.

04:41.143 --> 04:42.543
Right down by radio city.

04:42.611 --> 04:45.345
Roger, we should go.
Sorry, Lee.

04:45.413 --> 04:49.047
We gotta go.
Okay, bye-bye.

04:55.054 --> 04:56.955
Should I type all this up?

04:57.022 --> 05:00.791
Yes, and remind me
to remind Caroline
to tell lane

05:00.859 --> 05:03.094
That lucky strike noticed
that they're being billed

05:03.161 --> 05:05.497
For all the work we do
for everybody else
at this agency.

05:05.564 --> 05:07.599
You know what?
I don't want that on paper.

05:13.137 --> 05:16.205
- Who is that?
- A dear friend.

05:16.273 --> 05:18.541
Is that the letter
from California?

05:18.609 --> 05:19.842
Yes.

05:31.118 --> 05:33.986
- I hate this office.
- You wanted to be
close to Roger.

05:34.054 --> 05:36.655
Make yourself at home,
why don't you?

05:36.723 --> 05:38.623
Did you see Sunday's paper?

05:38.691 --> 05:41.158
If this is about
the Playtex ad they keep
complaining about,

05:41.225 --> 05:43.460
I've been told
the printer swapped
paper stocks.

05:43.527 --> 05:45.597
And I don't care
if she looks like
a Puerto Rican.

05:45.665 --> 05:47.265
Puerto Rican girls
buy brassieres.

05:47.333 --> 05:49.333
Not that they need to.

05:49.401 --> 05:50.935
I saw this one on the subway

05:51.002 --> 05:53.704
In one of those striped
Jean Seberg shirts,

05:53.771 --> 05:56.239
Red rag in her hair, nipples...

05:56.307 --> 05:58.741
I'm not in the mood.
What do you want?

05:58.809 --> 06:01.777
- Cosgrove's getting married.
- So?

06:01.845 --> 06:03.679
He took us
to the opera last month...

06:03.746 --> 06:05.647
Great seats and now I know why.

06:05.715 --> 06:08.583
- It turns out her father
shits gold ingots.
- What does he do?

06:08.650 --> 06:10.718
C.F.O. Of corning.

06:10.785 --> 06:12.385
My father-in-law's
a bus driver.

06:12.453 --> 06:14.353
The only place he can
take me is to the moon.

06:14.421 --> 06:17.055
Ken's the competition.
Why are you going to
the opera with him?

06:17.123 --> 06:18.990
Geyer is twice our size,

06:19.058 --> 06:20.358
And we're friends, aren't we?

06:20.425 --> 06:22.159
Friends.

06:22.227 --> 06:24.661
Why are you always
looking for a job?

06:24.729 --> 06:26.162
What?

06:28.332 --> 06:30.999
Look, Pete.

06:31.067 --> 06:33.701
There's a group of us,
we're all coming up together.

06:33.769 --> 06:35.669
You don't think
Kenny's a comer?

06:35.737 --> 06:37.704
You know he has
mountain dew?
That's Pepsi.

06:39.506 --> 06:41.374
We're having
lunch tomorrow.
Tag along.

06:41.442 --> 06:44.112
- He always asks about you.
- Of course he does.

06:44.179 --> 06:47.014
Worst case, Kenny'll brag
too much and you can steal
a client from him.

07:02.162 --> 07:03.629
Hello.

07:06.865 --> 07:09.333
I'm sorry.
That looks like bad news.

07:09.401 --> 07:12.469
Oh, it's not mine.
I'm Joyce.

07:12.537 --> 07:14.972
I work at "life"...
assistant photo editor.

07:15.039 --> 07:16.840
Peggy Olson,

07:16.908 --> 07:19.309
Sterling Cooper
draper Pryce...
copywriter.

07:19.377 --> 07:21.611
Really?

07:21.679 --> 07:23.913
"life" magazine...
I love your photos.

07:23.981 --> 07:26.282
Well, you'll never see these.

07:30.454 --> 07:32.621
I have to admit I'd be shocked.

07:32.689 --> 07:35.224
He's my friend
and my boss hates nudes.

07:35.291 --> 07:37.192
Who hates nudes?

07:39.528 --> 07:41.228
That's a beautiful one.

07:46.031 --> 07:49.231
I'm going to the mailroom.
Peggy, right? 37th floor?

08:07.311 --> 08:09.979
Tom, you're 15 minutes early.

08:10.046 --> 08:11.547
So are you.
Sit down.

08:11.614 --> 08:14.049
We can eat anytime
or not at all.

08:14.117 --> 08:15.884
Excuse me.
Dewar's on the rocks.

08:17.486 --> 08:19.286
What's so important?

08:20.422 --> 08:22.423
Well, Tom,

08:22.490 --> 08:24.458
How are you feeling?

08:24.525 --> 08:26.326
Couldn't be better.

08:28.862 --> 08:31.530
I hope you know
I've always done my best
to make you happy.

08:31.597 --> 08:33.063
I do.

08:34.967 --> 08:37.602
And there's no reason,
as far as I'm concerned,

08:37.669 --> 08:41.104
That there should be any
change in the way that we
deal with each other.

08:41.172 --> 08:43.773
Tom, I...

08:43.841 --> 08:46.876
This is very hard
for me to say.

08:46.943 --> 08:49.478
I honestly don't know how
you're going to take this

08:49.545 --> 08:51.346
And it's been
very hard to separate

08:51.414 --> 08:53.715
Our business relationship
from the rest of our life,

08:53.782 --> 08:55.549
But they should be separate.

08:55.617 --> 08:58.385
You are some kind
of high wasp, all right.

08:58.453 --> 09:01.087
- Look, I can't keep this up.
- Keep what up?

09:03.524 --> 09:06.058
- I heard.
- You know?

09:07.627 --> 09:09.628
You crazy kid.

09:13.633 --> 09:15.766
What are you talking about?

09:15.834 --> 09:18.269
Jeannie was with Trudy
at the doctor.

09:18.336 --> 09:20.071
Congratulations!

09:21.239 --> 09:22.306
What?

09:24.342 --> 09:26.743
Oh, shit.

09:28.378 --> 09:30.713
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

09:30.780 --> 09:32.881
<i>It was Monday,
for crying out loud.</i>

09:32.949 --> 09:35.283
Why hasn't she told you?

09:35.351 --> 09:37.285
I don't know.

09:37.352 --> 09:39.787
Well, it may be her news,
but it is good news.

09:39.854 --> 09:42.689
You can't tell her that
I told you. You can't.

09:46.493 --> 09:48.494
I'm going to be a father?

09:48.562 --> 09:51.463
Can you believe it?

09:53.999 --> 09:56.467
- I'm going to be
a father.
- Yeah.

09:58.403 --> 09:59.903
I feel like my heart's
going to burst.

10:01.172 --> 10:03.039
Champagne right here.
Bring a bottle.

10:03.107 --> 10:04.607
We're going to tie one on.

10:04.675 --> 10:06.709
If it's a boy, it's $1,000;

10:06.777 --> 10:08.510
A girl, $500.

10:08.578 --> 10:10.812
I'll do what I can do.

10:10.880 --> 10:13.481
You really can't tell Trudy.

10:13.549 --> 10:15.516
I don't know how I let
the cat out of the bag.

10:15.584 --> 10:18.619
I thought you knew
what I was talking about.

10:18.687 --> 10:20.854
What did you think
I was talking about?

10:20.922 --> 10:23.189
- What?
- Why did you
have to see me?

10:25.058 --> 10:27.593
I just wanted to...

10:27.661 --> 10:30.262
We're putting
new creative
on clearasil.

10:30.329 --> 10:31.729
Oh fine. Who cares?

10:33.599 --> 10:36.634
May you know
this feeling many times.

10:39.137 --> 10:41.604
Mmm. I only had the one

10:41.672 --> 10:44.440
And I love her to death,
but I wish we'd had more.

10:46.009 --> 10:47.976
Jeannie had
her uterus removed...

10:48.044 --> 10:49.778
Some kind of a cyst
or something.

10:53.949 --> 10:55.616
Trudy.

11:02.055 --> 11:04.690
I'm sick, Peter.
I'm so sick about this.

11:04.758 --> 11:07.592
Daddy just called me
from a pay phone drunk
and in tears.

11:07.660 --> 11:11.195
I know what you think.
I just wanted to wait till
our anniversary to tell you.

11:12.730 --> 11:14.264
I don't care, Trudy.

11:15.466 --> 11:16.899
I don't care how I heard.

11:18.935 --> 11:20.568
Oh, Peter.

11:25.839 --> 11:27.540
How did this happen?

11:27.608 --> 11:29.374
What did the doctor say?

11:29.442 --> 11:32.043
He said I was
going to have a baby.

11:33.579 --> 11:35.712
I want to pick you up
and spin you around,

11:35.780 --> 11:37.614
But I don't want
to damage anything in there.

11:39.083 --> 11:41.818
I'm so happy you're happy.

11:41.885 --> 11:44.789
I don't know.
It feels much different
than I expected.

11:44.857 --> 11:46.792
How would you know
what this feels like?

11:49.497 --> 11:51.399
Come, get off your feet.

11:52.834 --> 11:55.002
- How are you feeling?
- Oh.

11:55.070 --> 11:57.537
Tell me you'll
forgive my father.

11:57.605 --> 11:58.938
They already think
you hate them

11:59.006 --> 12:00.573
And, honestly, it's my fault.

12:00.641 --> 12:02.942
I don't hate them.

12:03.009 --> 12:06.144
I shouldn't have taken
my mother to the doctor...
not that doctor.

12:06.212 --> 12:08.413
It's just I thought
something was going on,

12:08.481 --> 12:10.314
And I was so prepared
to be disappointed

12:10.382 --> 12:12.550
Or that, God forbid,
something was really wrong.

12:12.617 --> 12:15.218
Trudy, I had to talk to him

12:15.286 --> 12:17.687
Because the agency has
to drop clearasil.

12:17.755 --> 12:20.890
- Why?
- There's another product
that's similar

12:20.957 --> 12:23.025
- And we can't...
- a conflict.

12:23.093 --> 12:25.293
Peter, I'm familiar
with the term.
You use it all the time.

12:25.361 --> 12:27.629
I invited him there

12:27.696 --> 12:29.430
And his good news
trumped my bad news.

12:29.498 --> 12:31.732
And the funny thing is,
that was the moment
to tell him.

12:32.867 --> 12:34.734
I was so bowled over.

12:38.605 --> 12:40.206
We did it.

12:44.377 --> 12:46.811
Why don't you
let my father
hear this from me?

12:46.879 --> 12:49.647
He's already so guilty,
he'll never feel
the knife go in.

12:49.715 --> 12:51.649
I can't let you do that.

12:51.716 --> 12:55.118
But I'm the one
who talked him into returning
to the agency to begin with.

12:55.186 --> 12:58.121
- We needed him.
- And now you don't.

12:58.188 --> 13:00.789
He'll be fine.
Tomorrow night.

13:00.857 --> 13:03.125
Yankee pot roast.

13:11.466 --> 13:13.801
Let's go. Caroline will
be watching your desk.

13:13.869 --> 13:15.703
Why don't you have to do this?

13:15.770 --> 13:17.704
You don't have to do this.
You're getting paid.

13:17.772 --> 13:21.107
We're old and we're married.
They don't want us.

13:21.175 --> 13:23.909
But I use pond's.
I do.

13:23.977 --> 13:25.344
Come on.

13:30.149 --> 13:31.650
Girls, find your places.

13:31.717 --> 13:33.318
Megan, help me
with the curtains.

13:44.261 --> 13:46.762
No matter how late
I come, I'm always
waiting for someone.

13:49.799 --> 13:52.534
I had to wait
until the girls left
the ladies' room to change.

13:52.602 --> 13:54.969
You could've
used my office,
but I don't have one.

13:58.374 --> 14:01.476
- This isn't right.
- I thought you wanted "Faye,"
not "Dr. Miller."

14:01.543 --> 14:04.644
Yes, but I told
someone to leave
the "e" off of "Faye."

14:04.712 --> 14:08.046
I like to be able to correct
it in front of the girls.
It makes them trust me.

14:08.114 --> 14:10.014
Because your name
is spelled wrong?

14:10.082 --> 14:13.084
Because I'm obviously
not that important.
I don't need it.

14:16.454 --> 14:19.957
- I have to warn you...
there's lots of perfume.
- There always is.

14:34.436 --> 14:36.236
<i>Why, everyone has
a nifty name tag.</i>

14:36.304 --> 14:40.540
Very well then.
I suppose I'll work
in Mr. Sterling's office.

14:40.608 --> 14:42.375
He won't be coming.

14:42.443 --> 14:44.444
As I said, my name is Faye.

14:47.247 --> 14:48.915
I don't have a name tag.

14:48.982 --> 14:50.449
I guess they forgot about me.

14:53.553 --> 14:55.120
Well, they got mine wrong.

14:55.188 --> 14:56.689
I'm dotty.

14:56.757 --> 14:58.858
I mean I'm not a dotty person.

14:58.926 --> 15:01.727
That's my name.

15:01.795 --> 15:03.862
Hello, dotty.

15:05.164 --> 15:08.000
So there's no reason
to be anxious.

15:08.067 --> 15:11.802
We have to enjoy the fact
that we're all getting paid
not to work for a little bit.

15:13.705 --> 15:16.439
But don't worry,
that's our little secret.

15:17.875 --> 15:19.776
And I'd like you
to think that this is

15:19.843 --> 15:21.277
<i>Just a bunch
of your friends,</i>

15:21.345 --> 15:24.714
<i>As if maybe
this is a sorority</i>

15:24.782 --> 15:28.584
Or a bridal shower...
With tea.

15:28.652 --> 15:32.187
<i>Or just a bunch
of us celebrating, say,</i>

15:32.255 --> 15:34.423
<i>Allison's birthday
at my apartment.</i>

15:36.792 --> 15:39.460
You shouldn't be surprised,

15:39.528 --> 15:41.062
Looking around the room,

15:41.130 --> 15:44.199
That we're here to talk about

15:45.368 --> 15:46.501
Beauty.

15:48.404 --> 15:50.806
What are the things we all do

15:50.873 --> 15:52.540
To keep ourselves beautiful

15:52.608 --> 15:54.909
Or simply to enhance it?

15:54.977 --> 15:56.144
Please pass a Danish.

15:59.248 --> 16:01.249
You don't have
to raise your hand.

16:01.317 --> 16:02.517
Anyone?

16:03.786 --> 16:05.587
I can say it.

16:05.655 --> 16:07.756
I have a routine.

16:09.125 --> 16:11.259
I brush my hair 100 times

16:11.327 --> 16:13.895
Just like I did
when I was a little girl,

16:13.963 --> 16:16.164
But of course
only the night before

16:16.231 --> 16:18.632
I have it set.

16:18.700 --> 16:21.902
- Very cute.
- Can you imagine?

16:21.970 --> 16:24.004
Your financial future's
in the hands

16:24.072 --> 16:26.207
Of a roomful
of 22-year-old girls.

16:26.274 --> 16:27.975
Not mine.

16:31.515 --> 16:32.916
Okay.

16:32.983 --> 16:34.684
Sometimes I watch my weight.

16:36.519 --> 16:38.586
No one's hungry?

16:42.423 --> 16:44.523
I'd like a Danish.

16:44.591 --> 16:47.725
I don't use pond's if
that's what you're asking.

16:47.793 --> 16:50.260
Mmm, that's okay.

16:50.328 --> 16:53.029
I'm of French extraction
and my mother has
beautiful skin.

16:53.097 --> 16:55.165
She never washes her face.

16:55.232 --> 16:58.500
She's not dirty.
She uses water,
but nothing else.

16:58.568 --> 17:01.202
And you do what she does?

17:01.270 --> 17:03.137
What does she do?

17:04.972 --> 17:08.040
She stands at the sink
and she runs the water

17:08.108 --> 17:10.976
Until it's just
the perfect temperature...
not too hot.

17:11.044 --> 17:12.744
And she splashes it on her face

17:12.813 --> 17:15.781
And she pats her cheeks
with her fingertips.

17:17.486 --> 17:19.355
And she looks at herself?

17:20.861 --> 17:22.465
Yes, she does.

17:26.074 --> 17:28.775
She's amazing.

17:28.842 --> 17:30.843
I sit at my vanity

17:30.911 --> 17:32.378
And I have this night cream...

17:32.446 --> 17:34.348
My boyfriend laughed at me.

17:34.416 --> 17:36.587
What was so funny about it?

17:36.654 --> 17:39.763
It was just,
you know, one time.

17:39.831 --> 17:41.703
At Christmas eve
we were staying up late

17:41.771 --> 17:43.638
And we were
playing house, I guess.

17:45.441 --> 17:48.776
You shouldn't
do things for them.
They don't appreciate it.

17:48.843 --> 17:51.411
You don't think
they appreciate
you being beautiful?

17:51.478 --> 17:53.612
We broke up a year ago.

17:56.449 --> 17:58.616
Actually, I don't know
what he noticed,

17:58.684 --> 18:00.718
But it wasn't me, I guess.

18:00.786 --> 18:02.820
It's worse when
they notice, sometimes.

18:04.255 --> 18:06.690
Allison, please continue.

18:08.426 --> 18:10.026
It... it's nothing.

18:18.966 --> 18:20.966
<i>- Are you in there?
- Yes.</i>

18:22.668 --> 18:24.835
I asked your girl to
inform me of your arrival.

18:24.903 --> 18:26.470
She's in that group.

18:26.538 --> 18:28.673
Did you speak with Tom?

18:28.740 --> 18:30.574
I'm sorry.
It didn't happen.

18:30.642 --> 18:32.309
The opportunity passed.

18:32.376 --> 18:34.544
Well, then we shall
endeavor to recreate it.

18:34.611 --> 18:36.512
Perhaps lunch today?

18:36.580 --> 18:38.914
I'm afraid Roger has
already informed pond's

18:38.982 --> 18:40.615
That this was attended to.

18:41.817 --> 18:43.518
That's sloppy.

18:43.585 --> 18:46.253
I have a lunch,
but I'm seeing him tonight.

18:46.321 --> 18:47.821
Damn it.

18:50.258 --> 18:51.658
Lane.

18:54.261 --> 18:56.562
I just found out
I'm going to be a father.

18:56.630 --> 18:59.131
Well now, that should
take the sting out
of all of this.

19:00.366 --> 19:02.300
I suppose.

19:03.468 --> 19:06.404
Uh, I apologize.

19:07.773 --> 19:10.073
That's the very best news.

19:12.909 --> 19:15.176
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

19:26.751 --> 19:28.318
And I just kept thinking

19:28.386 --> 19:30.286
"why does he stare
at other girls?"

19:32.588 --> 19:34.721
Well, men do that, but...

19:34.789 --> 19:36.656
But does he look
at me that way?

19:38.558 --> 19:41.693
And we're not married,
so who am I?

19:41.760 --> 19:44.095
How the hell did
this get so sad so fast?

19:44.163 --> 19:46.697
<i>- Shh!
I know I'm speaking</i>

19:46.764 --> 19:48.832
<i>For everyone here.</i>

19:48.900 --> 19:50.902
<i>You can't think
it has anything to do</i>

19:50.970 --> 19:52.338
<i>With how
you look, dotty.</i>

19:52.406 --> 19:54.006
You can only do your best

19:54.074 --> 19:55.541
With what God gave you.

19:57.410 --> 19:58.944
What about makeup?

20:00.947 --> 20:03.515
I feel like
it doesn't matter
what I see.

20:03.583 --> 20:05.984
It matters what he sees.

20:09.391 --> 20:11.327
I feel like
I gave him everything

20:11.395 --> 20:13.030
<i>- And I got nothing.</i>

20:15.300 --> 20:17.467
I could see
she was gonna crack.

20:17.535 --> 20:19.469
Allison?

20:19.536 --> 20:21.170
<i>Are you
all right, dear?</i>

20:25.975 --> 20:29.577
- It's okay.
She'll be all right.
- Should I...

20:29.645 --> 20:31.412
If she wanted
to be around us,
she would've stayed.

20:33.715 --> 20:38.051
Sarah, what do you do
that makes you feel good
about the way you look?

20:38.119 --> 20:39.852
I feel kind
of responsible.
Do you mind?

20:43.390 --> 20:46.091
Is there any
kind of ritual?

20:46.159 --> 20:48.559
I think my strategy was right.

20:48.627 --> 20:50.261
They just want to get married

20:50.329 --> 20:51.929
And they'll buy
anything that'll help.

20:56.234 --> 20:59.936
- Are you all right?
- Oh, it's you.

21:00.004 --> 21:01.505
Come with me.

21:09.949 --> 21:13.518
People cry in these things
all the time... grown men.

21:13.586 --> 21:15.853
I was in a bunch when I
first started working here.

21:15.921 --> 21:18.054
I'd say half the time
somebody cries.

21:18.122 --> 21:20.556
Really?

21:20.624 --> 21:23.058
I think it just
feels good to talk.

21:23.126 --> 21:24.759
I can't even say anything

21:24.827 --> 21:26.561
Because I know
he's right out there,

21:26.629 --> 21:27.929
Right through the glass.

21:29.198 --> 21:30.431
Who?

21:30.498 --> 21:33.065
I don't know how you stand it.

21:33.133 --> 21:36.034
The way he turns on
the charm one minute

21:36.102 --> 21:37.669
And then yanks it away.

21:37.737 --> 21:39.137
How can you even talk to him?

21:39.205 --> 21:40.805
Don?

21:40.873 --> 21:42.640
Would you stop it?

21:42.708 --> 21:46.410
I realize you must've
gone through everything
I've gone through.

21:46.477 --> 21:49.112
But now I know.
It's just... he's a drunk.

21:49.180 --> 21:52.282
And they get away
with murder because
they forget everything.

21:53.651 --> 21:55.885
I don't know what you think.

21:58.354 --> 22:00.688
Forget it.

22:00.756 --> 22:03.624
Your problem is not my problem.

22:03.692 --> 22:06.660
- Fine.
- And honestly,
you should get over it.

22:06.728 --> 22:08.662
please leave me alone.

22:15.101 --> 22:16.969
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

22:17.036 --> 22:18.036
- Bye.
- Bye.

22:20.073 --> 22:23.573
- Did she go home?
- No, she's fine.

22:23.641 --> 22:25.675
Nothing else good happened.

22:25.743 --> 22:27.877
- Bye now.
- Bye-bye.

22:29.680 --> 22:30.947
That went very well.

22:32.483 --> 22:33.916
You can stop the tape.

22:37.421 --> 22:39.021
Is she okay

22:39.089 --> 22:40.889
- Who?
- Yeah, she's fine.

22:43.959 --> 22:47.462
All right. Let's talk
preliminary results.

22:47.529 --> 22:50.497
Is it all right
if we put this back
the way it goes?

22:52.666 --> 22:55.701
- We can go to my office.
- Let's go in there.

23:07.172 --> 23:08.673
That's big big news.

23:08.741 --> 23:10.708
If you need any baby crap,
Jen and I have a closetful.

23:12.244 --> 23:14.479
- Hello, fellas.
- Good to see you, Kenny.

23:14.547 --> 23:16.014
- Pete.
- How are you, Ken?

23:19.117 --> 23:21.418
- Mr. Crane.
- Over here, Gil.

23:21.486 --> 23:23.120
There's a phone call for you.

23:23.187 --> 23:25.055
I've gotta get this.

23:25.122 --> 23:27.490
<i>Those goniffs at c.B.S.
Are screwing me again.</i>

23:27.558 --> 23:30.392
- Those what?
- Order for me...
Caesar salad, no dressing.

23:33.796 --> 23:35.096
- Ah.
- You want to take a look?

23:35.164 --> 23:36.697
Sure.

23:44.839 --> 23:47.373
Listen. I've got to
get this out of the way.

23:47.440 --> 23:50.943
But I would appreciate it
for the future

23:51.010 --> 23:53.311
If you would not
say shitty things
about me behind my back.

23:54.513 --> 23:55.980
What?

23:56.048 --> 23:58.349
Come on. Are you gonna
deny it and make it worse?

23:58.416 --> 24:00.517
I don't know
what you've heard,
but it's not true.

24:00.585 --> 24:03.219
You didn't call me
an all-American idiot

24:03.287 --> 24:04.620
Who fell into everything?

24:05.989 --> 24:07.889
Whom did I supposedly
say this to?

24:07.957 --> 24:09.357
Does it matter?

24:09.425 --> 24:12.293
Well, I'd like
to defend myself.

24:12.361 --> 24:14.995
I heard that you told
your wife that I was
driving the tractor

24:15.063 --> 24:17.263
- When the accident happened.
- What?

24:17.331 --> 24:19.232
I don't think so.

24:19.299 --> 24:21.868
What I probably said was
that you were involved...

24:21.936 --> 24:25.171
We all were...
and that it was
your account.

24:25.239 --> 24:28.173
And crane told me
yesterday you said
I was marrying for money.

24:28.241 --> 24:30.742
<i>I didn't say that.
He did.</i>

24:30.810 --> 24:33.210
Well, he's like that
and everybody who knows
him knows that.

24:33.278 --> 24:36.079
But when you say it...
and especially when it
gets back to my fiancee...

24:36.147 --> 24:38.947
Trudy knows her,
you know... some garden club.

24:40.749 --> 24:42.416
I was unaware of that.

24:42.483 --> 24:44.517
Look. You know what?

24:46.753 --> 24:49.220
<i>I apologize...
mea culpa.</i>

24:50.722 --> 24:52.990
That's textbook Harry.

24:54.458 --> 24:56.158
You know what?
He's buying lunch.

24:56.226 --> 24:59.929
I don't really care.
I'm just glad to be
out of the office.

24:59.996 --> 25:02.632
Mmm, it is nice,
especially without
having to listen

25:02.700 --> 25:05.402
To some client yammering
about how dirty the city is.

25:05.470 --> 25:08.472
- Huh.
- How's it going?

25:08.540 --> 25:10.307
I've been
floating along laterally,

25:10.375 --> 25:12.409
But I don't know
that it's a love affair.

25:12.476 --> 25:14.911
- It's better than McCann.
- What was that like?

25:14.979 --> 25:17.180
Are you kidding me?
It's the worst agency
I've ever seen.

25:17.248 --> 25:18.681
<i>The worst.</i>

25:18.749 --> 25:21.184
My mother was
a nurse at the state
hospital in Vermont

25:21.252 --> 25:24.121
And that was the last time
I saw so many retarded people
in one building.

25:29.427 --> 25:32.896
So you're getting married.
Congratulations.

25:32.963 --> 25:34.731
It's all that
really matters, right?

25:36.800 --> 25:39.702
Actually, I have
a bit of news of my own.

25:41.437 --> 25:42.871
Trudy is with child.

25:42.939 --> 25:46.042
Good for you.
Good for you.

25:46.109 --> 25:48.246
I'll be honest...
I can't wait.

25:48.314 --> 25:51.351
It's very good so far.

25:51.419 --> 25:54.389
Hmm. A new family,
a new agency...

25:54.456 --> 25:55.690
It has to be exciting.

25:55.758 --> 25:57.959
Well, you know,
wherever you do this job,

25:58.027 --> 25:59.627
You're doing this job.

25:59.695 --> 26:02.263
I know you're all slaves
to draper over there,

26:02.331 --> 26:05.933
But I'd rather be
a slave to creative
than some old fart.

26:06.001 --> 26:08.402
Whoever pours
the last drink gets
all the credit

26:08.470 --> 26:10.805
And you're spinning
your wheels half the time.

26:12.574 --> 26:14.508
Right now we're
chasing mountain dew.

26:14.576 --> 26:16.777
Supposedly we're going
to turn it into Pepsi,

26:16.845 --> 26:18.278
But the only reason
Pepsi would do it

26:18.346 --> 26:20.047
Is to make b.B.D.O. Sweat.

26:20.114 --> 26:23.450
This whole idea that we'd get
the bigger company is a joke.

26:23.517 --> 26:26.319
We'd just end up with
a bunch of little pieces.

26:29.423 --> 26:32.692
Well, the grass is
always greener.

26:32.760 --> 26:34.794
Oh, who am I kidding?

26:34.862 --> 26:36.996
Look how lucky we are.

26:37.063 --> 26:39.498
Another Campbell...

26:39.565 --> 26:41.567
That's just what
the world needs.

26:54.983 --> 26:58.052
- Can I come in?
- It's your office.

26:58.119 --> 26:59.920
Glad to see
you're feeling better.

27:02.890 --> 27:04.624
If you don't feel
like working...

27:16.436 --> 27:17.770
What?

27:17.837 --> 27:20.873
I'm very embarrassed.

27:20.941 --> 27:23.442
People cry in those groups
all the time, Allison.

27:24.745 --> 27:26.812
That's not what
I'm embarrassed about.

27:28.981 --> 27:31.450
This actually happened.

27:33.520 --> 27:35.020
I know.

27:36.490 --> 27:38.324
I know.

27:38.392 --> 27:40.426
We made a mistake

27:41.695 --> 27:45.064
And I feel like it's awkward

27:45.132 --> 27:49.001
And it's better
for both of us
if I move on.

27:49.069 --> 27:51.904
I don't think
that's necessary.
We're both adults.

27:51.972 --> 27:54.440
No, I really would
feel better about it.

27:54.507 --> 27:58.476
A friend of mine told me
about a job at a magazine

27:58.544 --> 28:02.547
And I thought that
might be interesting,
working for a woman.

28:04.550 --> 28:05.750
Anyway, I...

28:07.753 --> 28:10.755
I would appreciate it
if you could write me
a recommendation.

28:10.823 --> 28:13.491
Absolutely.
What would probably
be even better

28:13.559 --> 28:16.060
Is if you type up
whatever you want
and I'll sign it.

28:17.696 --> 28:20.631
- What?
- You've been sparkling
in your duties.

28:20.699 --> 28:22.934
Just put it on my stationery,
put whatever you want
and I'll sign it.

28:37.183 --> 28:39.317
I don't say this easily,

28:39.385 --> 28:41.919
But you're not a good person.

28:45.291 --> 28:46.892
Allison, hold on.

29:03.911 --> 29:05.411
What's going on?

29:06.680 --> 29:08.615
I'm gonna need a new secretary.

29:08.683 --> 29:11.385
And this cleaned up.

29:11.452 --> 29:15.688
Would you be open
to Allison returning
in a couple of days?

29:15.756 --> 29:17.656
If that's what she wants.

29:17.724 --> 29:19.124
Really?

29:19.192 --> 29:21.059
No.

29:46.086 --> 29:49.055
<i>There's a Joyce Ramsey
to see you at reception.</i>

29:52.127 --> 29:55.095
So at this point you've
read everything out here?

29:55.163 --> 29:57.497
I don't even like magazines,

29:57.565 --> 30:00.233
But I brought in
a book and they told me
it didn't look right.

30:00.300 --> 30:02.502
Hi.

30:02.569 --> 30:04.771
Do you want
to come back
and see my office?

30:04.838 --> 30:06.940
Another time.

30:07.007 --> 30:08.774
Listen, my friend
the photographer,

30:08.842 --> 30:11.276
Mr. Reject,
he's having a...

30:11.344 --> 30:14.145
I don't even know
what to call it...
downtown.

30:15.581 --> 30:16.714
Are you inviting me?

30:19.852 --> 30:21.919
- Are you afraid
of the subway?
- Of course not.

30:23.755 --> 30:24.889
Thanks, sweetheart.

30:24.957 --> 30:27.091
Washington market,

30:27.159 --> 30:31.195
Unless you have to work
or have plans that are
more interesting.

30:31.263 --> 30:34.331
It starts at 9:00.
I'll be there at 10:00.

30:38.236 --> 30:41.004
She's kind of pretentious.

30:41.072 --> 30:42.939
I know.

30:49.502 --> 30:52.771
darling, we're
so excited.

30:52.839 --> 30:55.308
<i>Is that you, Peter?</i>

30:55.375 --> 30:57.143
I'm gonna keep
my mouth shut from now on.

30:59.946 --> 31:02.046
Well, hello there.

31:02.114 --> 31:03.982
How are you feeling?

31:04.049 --> 31:06.985
A little behind.
Why don't you let me fix
my father and you a drink

31:07.052 --> 31:09.921
And you can show my mother
what we have planned
for the maid's room.

31:09.988 --> 31:11.388
I'll make the drinks.
I don't care.

31:11.456 --> 31:13.657
No, why don't you show
your mother the maid's room?

31:13.725 --> 31:15.258
I don't know
that I'm an expert.

31:15.326 --> 31:16.794
Oh, okay.

31:16.861 --> 31:18.696
Come along, mother.

31:21.167 --> 31:22.867
We're a couple
of lucky ducks,
aren't we?

31:22.935 --> 31:25.302
We are. Tom, let me
ask you something.

31:25.370 --> 31:27.938
- What are you having?
- In a minute. Listen...

31:28.006 --> 31:31.275
Oh, I know what
you're gonna say.

31:31.342 --> 31:33.576
You need a bigger
apartment. I get it.

31:33.643 --> 31:36.808
Every time you jump
to conclusions, Tom,
you make me respect you less.

31:36.876 --> 31:38.941
- What?
- Look.

31:39.008 --> 31:41.342
You gave us clearasil
and we're extremely
grateful,

31:41.409 --> 31:43.443
But there's only
so much business
it's going to do.

31:43.510 --> 31:45.744
Yeah, well, that's kind
of in your hands, isn't it?

31:45.811 --> 31:47.379
I'm done auditioning.

31:49.414 --> 31:51.582
You gave us this
under a certain pretext.

31:51.650 --> 31:53.687
I've done well by you.
And the idea was

31:53.755 --> 31:55.422
If we do well by this account,

31:55.490 --> 31:57.490
You'll give us a shot
at the big one,

31:57.558 --> 32:00.127
Because right now
I have bigger business
than clearasil.

32:00.195 --> 32:02.063
Are you mad at me?

32:02.131 --> 32:06.167
No. Clearasil was
conflicted out by
a bigger company

32:06.235 --> 32:08.569
And I'm trying to build
a business here.

32:08.637 --> 32:10.437
Well, what do you want?

32:10.505 --> 32:12.339
Do you want the cough syrup?

32:12.406 --> 32:15.641
I want all of it. I want
the formula 44 mixture,

32:15.709 --> 32:19.780
The cough drops,
the inhaler, Vaporub.

32:19.848 --> 32:22.482
Who's doing a better job
for you than I have?

32:22.550 --> 32:26.318
Well, you've given me
something to think about.

32:27.453 --> 32:28.886
Really?

32:28.954 --> 32:30.521
I think it's pretty simple.

32:30.589 --> 32:31.722
What can I get you?

32:34.693 --> 32:37.028
Trudy, do we have any ice?

32:38.730 --> 32:40.864
You son of a bitch.

32:44.167 --> 32:46.267
<i>Tom, you have
to come see this.</i>

33:51.334 --> 33:52.334
Joyce!

33:54.304 --> 33:57.740
- I made it.
- You look so elegant.

33:57.808 --> 33:59.776
Okay.

33:59.843 --> 34:01.711
Peggy works
in the same building.

34:01.779 --> 34:04.247
Sharon was one
of Davey's models.

34:04.315 --> 34:06.049
What did your mother say?

34:06.117 --> 34:07.951
Oh, she doesn't know.

34:11.121 --> 34:14.558
- What is that?
- He screws around
with movies too.

34:14.626 --> 34:16.694
He's not as good at it.

34:16.761 --> 34:18.962
I can't believe
how big this place is.

34:19.030 --> 34:21.098
I think it was a sweatshop.

34:21.166 --> 34:23.067
Is there beer or something?

34:23.135 --> 34:25.235
I thought I saw
someone with a beer.

34:26.405 --> 34:28.206
Jesus.

34:28.274 --> 34:29.942
I thought I needed
a lot of attention.

34:32.179 --> 34:34.914
Listen, I'm already high,

34:34.982 --> 34:37.784
But this is easier
than finding a beer.

34:37.851 --> 34:39.152
If you'd like?

34:40.487 --> 34:42.155
I'd love it.

34:52.565 --> 34:54.299
Hey!

34:55.833 --> 34:56.967
I'm hungry.

34:59.340 --> 35:01.642
I have a boyfriend.

35:01.710 --> 35:04.044
He doesn't own your vagina.

35:05.446 --> 35:07.414
No, but he's renting it.

36:20.959 --> 36:23.626
This film is
more interesting
than I thought.

36:23.693 --> 36:25.593
It's rhythmic.

36:25.661 --> 36:27.027
Yeah.

36:31.564 --> 36:33.632
I thought I was gonna
get to meet him.

36:36.101 --> 36:37.569
Abe!

36:39.939 --> 36:41.906
Where the hell's Kellogg?

36:44.177 --> 36:46.378
Hey. Abe.

36:46.446 --> 36:48.914
- Are you with Joyce?
- Are you?

36:48.982 --> 36:51.817
- I'm Peggy.
- Peggy's a writer.

36:51.885 --> 36:53.352
So am I.
What do you write?

36:53.420 --> 36:55.287
I'm a copywriter.

36:55.355 --> 36:56.922
But what do you write?

36:56.990 --> 36:58.857
That is writing.

36:58.925 --> 37:00.525
You're not working
on something else?

37:01.761 --> 37:04.830
Davey Kellogg,
this is Peggy Olson.

37:04.897 --> 37:07.465
- She wanted to meet you.
- I'm catholic.

37:07.533 --> 37:09.301
So do you like it?

37:09.368 --> 37:12.003
I don't think I'm supposed to.

37:12.071 --> 37:14.972
I love your nudes.
We're looking for
photographers.

37:15.040 --> 37:17.208
I'm glad I was here
to see this.

37:17.276 --> 37:20.878
- Who's "we"?
- I work at sterling
Cooper draper Pryce...

37:20.946 --> 37:24.148
- Advertising.
- Why would I ever do that?

37:24.216 --> 37:26.851
So you can get paid
to practice your art.

37:26.919 --> 37:29.287
Art in advertising?

37:29.355 --> 37:31.723
Why would anyone
do that after Warhol?

37:33.292 --> 37:35.726
Sorry, for somebody
to sell their soul,

37:35.794 --> 37:38.796
<i>- They've got to have one.</i>

37:38.863 --> 37:41.164
<i>- It's a raid!
- It's the N.Y.P.D.!</i>

37:43.501 --> 37:45.035
This way.

37:45.103 --> 37:46.403
Wait wait.

37:53.411 --> 37:55.411
<i>This is the N.Y.P.D.! Stop!</i>

37:57.615 --> 37:59.181
<i>- Nobody move!</i>

37:59.249 --> 38:02.485
you know, I've been
arrested before.

38:02.552 --> 38:04.586
for what?

38:04.654 --> 38:07.823
I was writing about
this boycott in Harlem

38:07.891 --> 38:11.493
And they wouldn't leave,
so I didn't leave.

38:11.561 --> 38:13.495
Oh. Did you
go to jail?

38:15.031 --> 38:17.198
No.

38:17.266 --> 38:19.067
My sister came and got me.

38:22.304 --> 38:24.371
I feel like I should kiss you.

38:39.586 --> 38:41.253
Come on.

38:45.124 --> 38:47.325
<i>They chased everybody
down the fire escape.</i>

38:50.896 --> 38:53.832
- Are they beating people?
- They took the film.

38:53.899 --> 38:56.034
I should see this.
It could be a story.

38:56.101 --> 38:58.636
- How can I find you?
- I know where she is.

39:29.662 --> 39:31.061
Nice to see you,
miss Blankenship.

39:31.129 --> 39:33.795
I look forward
to hearing that every day.

39:33.863 --> 39:36.330
There's coffee
and a roll on your desk

39:36.398 --> 39:38.131
And Mr. Sterling would
like to see you.

39:38.199 --> 39:40.399
Roger, he's here.

39:41.701 --> 39:42.901
Could you get the others?

39:48.706 --> 39:50.774
Blankenship? Boy.

39:50.842 --> 39:53.076
Hello?
Could you fetch Campbell

39:53.144 --> 39:56.446
And Pryce, lane...
misters.

39:56.514 --> 39:58.782
What did you do
to make them take her
out of mothballs?

39:58.850 --> 40:00.550
She was working
in Cooper's apartment.

40:00.618 --> 40:02.952
Allison found
a better opportunity.

40:03.020 --> 40:04.554
Do you know he works
without pants?

40:04.622 --> 40:06.355
Morning, don.

40:06.423 --> 40:08.257
- Don.
- Morning.

40:08.325 --> 40:10.826
I'd like to say
in front of this
informal partners' meeting

40:10.893 --> 40:13.028
That I am in the midst
of signing Vicks chemical...

40:13.095 --> 40:16.031
The entire cough line.
It bills at around $6 million

40:16.098 --> 40:19.200
- And they love television.
- It's truly spectacular news.

40:19.268 --> 40:21.269
Congratulations.
How'd you swing that?

40:21.336 --> 40:22.937
I guess as
the president would say,

40:23.005 --> 40:24.906
I turned chickenshit
into chicken salad.

40:24.974 --> 40:26.842
I thought I'd kick
clearasil over to geyer.

40:26.910 --> 40:28.911
Anyone but Chaough.

40:28.979 --> 40:32.280
We're taking Philip Coakmeyer
and Tom Vogel to luncheon today.

40:32.348 --> 40:34.782
Don't worry,
we already checked it
with your, uh, girl.

40:37.686 --> 40:39.586
- Keep it up.
- Thank you, don.

40:44.525 --> 40:47.328
Please reschedule
Dr. Miller.

40:50.999 --> 40:53.201
They're not really
pornography, per Se.

40:53.269 --> 40:55.303
They're just nudes.

40:55.370 --> 40:57.440
They're like
renaissance paintings.

40:57.508 --> 41:00.912
The party sounds fun.
We had nude models
in school.

41:00.980 --> 41:03.915
You know right away whoever
has the best drawing
is going to get her.

41:03.982 --> 41:06.450
Did you know Malcolm x
was shot last Sunday?

41:06.518 --> 41:08.218
Yes, Peggy.

41:08.286 --> 41:09.886
Did you know who he was?

41:09.954 --> 41:12.055
You ever read the stuff
between the ads?

41:12.122 --> 41:15.158
A few of us are sending
a bottle of champagne
to the Campbells.

41:15.226 --> 41:17.193
I'll sign the card.

41:17.261 --> 41:19.995
- I was hoping
for a contribution.
- No thank you.

41:29.272 --> 41:31.707
- Trudy's pregnant?
- Mm-hmm.

41:31.775 --> 41:33.876
I can't believe
that guy's married
to her.

41:38.584 --> 41:40.419
I would get her so pregnant.

41:52.275 --> 41:53.842
Hello.

41:53.909 --> 41:56.245
Congratulations.

41:56.313 --> 41:58.114
Yes.

41:58.181 --> 42:00.917
A $6-million account should
shut lane up for a while.

42:00.985 --> 42:03.319
No, I mean about the baby.

42:06.090 --> 42:09.493
Yes. I guess
that's news.

42:09.561 --> 42:12.964
I just wanted
to let you know
how happy I am for you...

42:13.032 --> 42:14.633
Both.

42:16.938 --> 42:18.607
Thank you.

42:49.529 --> 42:52.530
<i>Dr. Miller
is here to see you.</i>

42:52.598 --> 42:54.699
<i>It's a she.</i>

42:56.502 --> 42:58.003
Send her in.

43:05.145 --> 43:07.913
- What do you want?
- Nothing. I moved
the meeting.

43:07.981 --> 43:11.250
Oh, your secretary
said you needed to
see me immediately.

43:14.588 --> 43:17.490
We're still working things out.

43:17.557 --> 43:19.959
Well, I've done everything
but finish the report.

43:20.026 --> 43:21.994
How'd we do?

43:22.061 --> 43:25.630
Well, it turns out
the hypothesis was rejected.

43:25.697 --> 43:28.032
I'd recommend
a strategy that links

43:28.099 --> 43:30.034
Pond's cold cream
to matrimony...

43:30.102 --> 43:32.604
A veiled promise.

43:32.672 --> 43:34.339
Hello, 1925.

43:35.742 --> 43:37.443
I'm not gonna do that,

43:37.510 --> 43:39.278
So what are we gonna
tell the client?

43:40.747 --> 43:42.548
I can't change the truth.

43:42.615 --> 43:45.050
How do you know
that's the truth?

43:45.118 --> 43:47.553
A new idea is something
they don't know yet,

43:47.620 --> 43:50.022
So of course it's not gonna
come up as an option.

43:50.089 --> 43:51.923
Put my campaign
on TV for a year,

43:51.991 --> 43:54.092
Then hold your group again,
maybe it'll show up.

43:54.160 --> 43:55.927
Well, I tried everything.

43:55.995 --> 43:58.063
I said "routine."
I tried "ritual."

43:58.130 --> 43:59.798
All they care about
is a husband.

43:59.865 --> 44:01.733
You were there.
I'll show you
the transcripts.

44:01.801 --> 44:04.002
You can't tell how people
are going to behave

44:04.070 --> 44:05.704
Based on how they have behaved.

44:05.771 --> 44:07.372
Why are you being so hostile?

44:07.440 --> 44:09.674
You think I've never had
this argument before?

44:09.742 --> 44:12.710
Because you go in there
and you stick your finger
in people's brains

44:12.778 --> 44:15.213
And they just start talking...
blah blah blah...
just to be heard.

44:17.049 --> 44:18.716
And you know what?
Not only does it have

44:18.784 --> 44:20.785
Nothing to do with what I do,
but it's nobody's business

44:22.120 --> 44:24.288
Well, you're the client.

44:24.356 --> 44:25.556
That's right.

44:47.645 --> 44:48.946
<i>- Hello.
- It's Joyce.</i>

44:49.013 --> 44:50.647
<i>Lunch,
five minutes.</i>

44:50.715 --> 44:52.849
Um, sure.

44:52.917 --> 44:55.752
<i>- Meet you in the lobby?
- No, my friends want
to see Megan.</i>

45:01.225 --> 45:03.827
Pete, you remember
Phil Coakmeyer.

45:03.895 --> 45:05.762
- A pleasure
to see you again.
- Shall we?

45:05.830 --> 45:07.497
We're just waiting on don.

45:16.374 --> 45:17.874
Hi.

45:17.942 --> 45:21.344
- You want to join us?
- I can't.

46:05.488 --> 46:07.189
<i>- Did you get pears?</i>

46:10.727 --> 46:12.661
Did you get pears?

46:15.031 --> 46:17.099
Did you get pears?

46:17.167 --> 46:19.968
We'll discuss it inside.

47:04.089 --> 47:06.089
