WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:02.794
-Drop it!
-Come on!

00:05.588 --> 00:07.841
NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on</i> Hill Street Blues...

00:07.924 --> 00:09.676
Man came out with a piece, Harry.

00:10.719 --> 00:12.053
We hunted the guy.

00:12.137 --> 00:14.973
Hey, Lieutenant,
is it true that horses can't see anything

00:15.056 --> 00:16.307
directly in front of them?

00:17.142 --> 00:20.478
Do you think that you, um, would marry me?

00:20.562 --> 00:23.356
I thought you were gonna give me the boot,
as sure as anything.

00:23.440 --> 00:25.400
Do you, Jesus Emilio Martinez,

00:25.483 --> 00:27.652
take this woman to be
your lawful-wedded wife?

00:28.236 --> 00:29.404
Yeah, I do.

00:29.487 --> 00:32.073
I need us back together so much.

00:32.157 --> 00:33.575
We have been separate.

00:35.785 --> 00:37.996
LUCY: Okay, let me get through
the rest of this.

00:38.079 --> 00:40.749
So, please, what do you say, huh?
Item 11.

00:41.332 --> 00:42.625
More gang violence.

00:43.668 --> 00:48.214
Night shift reports
another drive-by shooting, 3:00 a.m.

00:48.298 --> 00:50.258
This time on Gypsy Boy turf.

00:50.341 --> 00:51.342
No casualties.

00:51.885 --> 00:54.179
But the captain says
that you can expect reprisals.

00:54.262 --> 00:57.140
It's gonna be this bad and worse
until they sign some of those treaties.

00:57.223 --> 00:59.851
Also, same item.
We got a gang summit right here,

00:59.934 --> 01:02.103
roll call, 0900 hours this morning.

01:02.187 --> 01:06.441
The purpose is to lower temperatures,
and I guess to let them air their gripes.

01:06.524 --> 01:09.569
Some of those gripes are gonna be aimed
right at this Marcus Peabody.

01:09.652 --> 01:11.738
That's the guy that
Mayor Cleveland appointed

01:11.821 --> 01:15.366
the head of the Youth Corps
summer jobs program.

01:15.784 --> 01:19.954
Most of us can remember the honorable
Mr. Peabody as a member of the Blood.

01:20.038 --> 01:22.957
The guy puts on a suit,
all of a sudden he's a citizen, right?

01:23.041 --> 01:24.709
Coffey, why don't you say that
right to his face?

01:24.793 --> 01:26.086
He's gonna be at the gang summit.

01:26.169 --> 01:28.004
You and Rudy will be babysitting.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.507
Also, give me Mack, Lane,
and Kaysack on that one.

01:30.590 --> 01:32.842
Moving right along, item 12.

01:34.010 --> 01:36.304
Code name's "Straight Flush."

01:37.097 --> 01:39.516
Once again, we got your unsavory
criminal elements

01:39.599 --> 01:41.392
strong-arming your local bar owners,

01:41.476 --> 01:45.188
this time into getting them
to install some of the latest

01:45.271 --> 01:47.732
in the state-of-the-art
electronic gambling devices.

01:47.816 --> 01:49.109
Now, what we're talking about here

01:49.192 --> 01:53.071
is your basic computerized
video-poker games.

01:53.154 --> 01:54.614
We got Detective Belker on this one,

01:54.697 --> 01:58.159
and we got Officers Hill
and Renko assigned undercover.

01:58.868 --> 02:01.746
We're hoping, in fact, that Belker
can infiltrate the whole organization.

02:01.830 --> 02:04.833
Guys, word of caution.
Don't draw to an inside straight.

02:04.916 --> 02:07.502
-(laughter)
-LUCY: All right...

02:07.585 --> 02:09.629
Item 13. Budget cuts.

02:10.380 --> 02:15.718
City Council just published a list
of proposed deletions to the new budget.

02:16.469 --> 02:18.638
And I am real sorry to say
that it looks like

02:18.721 --> 02:20.431
the Equine Unit is in big trouble.

02:20.515 --> 02:21.349
(crowd murmuring)

02:21.432 --> 02:24.018
However, Lieutenant Hunter
is gonna be addressing

02:24.102 --> 02:25.812
that very subcommittee this morning.

02:26.563 --> 02:28.606
And he feels, or he's pretty sure anyway,

02:29.190 --> 02:33.069
that, as he said, he can talk
some horse sense into the naysayers.

02:33.153 --> 02:36.197
(laughter)

02:36.281 --> 02:37.866
LUCY: Almost done, guys.

02:37.949 --> 02:40.201
Got a couple more items
of a personal nature.

02:40.285 --> 02:44.539
Mick Belker reminds me to remind you
that the chessboard on his desk

02:44.622 --> 02:48.960
is the focus of an ongoing serious contest
between he and Lieutenant Hunter,

02:49.043 --> 02:50.879
so don't touch the pieces.

02:50.962 --> 02:52.797
Chess? He can't even play tick-tack-toe.

02:52.881 --> 02:54.591
(laughing)

02:55.758 --> 02:58.720
Okay, also, Andy Renko
wanted me to announce

02:58.803 --> 03:03.933
that he knows that some of his groomsmen
have not yet had their tuxedo fitting.

03:04.017 --> 03:07.645
Now, now, now.
The groom don't want to lead anybody

03:07.729 --> 03:10.398
down the aisle like schoolboys
or nothing, but...

03:10.481 --> 03:13.193
Joe Coffey and my best man--

03:13.276 --> 03:14.527
Come on. All right, all right.

03:14.611 --> 03:16.696
-All right, you know who you are.
-ANDY: Uh...

03:16.779 --> 03:20.158
LUCY AND ANDY:
It's at Sam Waterloo's Acre of Tuxedos.

03:20.241 --> 03:22.619
-1797 West Polk.
-1797 West Polk, y'all.

03:22.702 --> 03:24.412
-LUCY: Last item is weather.
-All right, all right.

03:25.455 --> 03:27.832
It's been pretty good, this warm streak
looks like it's gonna last

03:27.916 --> 03:29.334
for at least another week.

03:30.752 --> 03:34.505
Now, it's come to my attention
that some of you fun-lovers

03:34.589 --> 03:37.592
have been using the roof
of this very building

03:37.675 --> 03:39.302
as a kind of personal solarium.

03:39.385 --> 03:41.846
What you do with your lunch
is what you do.

03:41.930 --> 03:44.807
But I have here your
basic memo from Division,

03:44.891 --> 03:47.477
which says that one of their copters
went over our roof yesterday

03:47.560 --> 03:50.772
and saw two officers,
one male and one female,

03:50.855 --> 03:53.524
sunbathing in their underwear.

03:53.608 --> 03:55.568
(cheers and applause)

03:55.652 --> 03:58.905
LUCY:
Guys! Give me a break, will you please?

03:58.988 --> 04:01.658
You want me to go up there
and padlock that door?

04:02.033 --> 04:03.201
Got it? That's it.

04:03.284 --> 04:06.412
Let's roll, and let's be careful
out there, huh?

04:06.496 --> 04:09.082
(indistinct conversations)

04:12.335 --> 04:14.796
-Where was your partner?
-Late. Third time in a week, man.

04:14.879 --> 04:16.214
-White guys...
-Mm-hm.

04:16.297 --> 04:17.674
-How's J.D. looking?
-He peaked.

04:17.757 --> 04:20.009
Doc said maybe a couple more weeks.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.302
Yo, Harry, what's the matter?

04:21.386 --> 04:24.013
The worst, man, the worst start on a day.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.516
-Meet a chick who don't like alarm clocks?
-No, I rear-ended a guy.

04:26.599 --> 04:27.934
-And guess what?
-He died.

04:28.017 --> 04:29.727
No insurance. My insurance is up.

04:29.811 --> 04:31.104
Uh-oh. We talking whiplash?

04:31.187 --> 04:34.774
We're talking whiplash, tonsils,
appendicitis, shooting pains.

04:34.857 --> 04:35.692
I want to kill him.

04:35.775 --> 04:37.860
You mean the guy you're gonna be
working for the rest of your life?

04:37.944 --> 04:40.154
If Floyd Joyner's looking for me,
I told him to come up here.

04:40.238 --> 04:43.241
Hey, hey, look, sport, anytime you feel
like doing some police work,

04:43.324 --> 04:46.452
we got three shelves of Mendoza files
to go through, okay?

04:46.536 --> 04:48.496
-Mendoza...
-It was a police case, Harry.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.175
My goodness, Mick, you amaze me.

05:01.968 --> 05:07.056
You bring to the board predatory instincts
and a kind of naive gusto

05:07.140 --> 05:08.933
that is marvelous to behold,

05:09.017 --> 05:12.478
occasionally reminiscent
of the raw, native energy

05:12.562 --> 05:14.147
of a young Capablanca.

05:15.732 --> 05:18.693
The Sicilian defense,
opening these broad corridors

05:18.776 --> 05:23.031
to your bishops,
the bold thrust of your queen-side pawns.

05:23.114 --> 05:26.075
But unfortunately, Mick, as you have here,

05:26.159 --> 05:31.164
the young Capablanca often fell victim
to his own excesses.

05:31.247 --> 05:34.250
Speed at the expense of strategy,

05:35.376 --> 05:40.214
brute show of power
at the expense of finesse.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.885
In spite of which,
I maintain that if you would take the time

05:43.968 --> 05:46.262
to refine your gifts, Mick,

05:46.346 --> 05:49.057
you have all the makings
of a first-rate player.

05:52.727 --> 05:53.728
Checkmate.

05:55.063 --> 05:57.273
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

05:57.607 --> 05:59.400
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

05:59.484 --> 06:03.196
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

06:03.279 --> 06:05.073
(sirens wailing)

06:10.453 --> 06:14.248
(theme music playing)

07:29.031 --> 07:30.783
Hi. Todd Courtney with the PD'S office.

07:30.867 --> 07:32.702
I'll be handling
Ms. Davenport's caseload.

07:32.785 --> 07:35.580
Excuse me?
Is Davenport being called to trial?

07:35.663 --> 07:37.165
Uh, yeah, must have.

07:37.248 --> 07:39.876
She phoned the office
to have somebody take her case interviews.

07:40.543 --> 07:41.878
JESUS: I don't want to hear no baby talk.

07:41.961 --> 07:43.963
(speaking Spanish)

07:45.798 --> 07:47.550
Martinez, table of four.

07:49.844 --> 07:51.304
I think I can relish it.

07:51.596 --> 07:52.430
Relish what?

07:52.763 --> 07:53.890
The look on that geek's face

07:53.973 --> 07:57.226
when I ride down on him from the saddle
of an Arabian stallion.

07:57.852 --> 08:00.730
The horse, Ray,
strikes an almost superstitious fear

08:00.813 --> 08:03.774
into your uneducated,
city-dwelling brown types.

08:03.858 --> 08:07.278
Look at Cortés
and the subjugation of the Aztecs.

08:09.197 --> 08:10.990
Detective H. Garibaldi, please.

08:11.073 --> 08:12.533
Mr. Joyner, you want to come talk?

08:13.534 --> 08:15.203
We'll go right over here, please.

08:15.286 --> 08:18.456
It's a crime, you know? What you did.

08:18.539 --> 08:20.958
Operating without no insurance.

08:21.042 --> 08:22.335
It's also a crime, Mr. Joyner,

08:22.418 --> 08:25.296
if you exaggerate and you perjure yourself
about your injuries.

08:25.379 --> 08:27.173
Now, I hit you going about
ten miles per hour.

08:27.256 --> 08:29.383
I'm unemployed, got three kids to feed,

08:29.467 --> 08:34.555
and some cop with a job goes around
having accidents with no insurance.

08:34.639 --> 08:37.850
Look, if you get me an estimate for your
car and you send me the doctor bills,

08:37.934 --> 08:39.560
I'm gonna make sure you get paid.

08:40.937 --> 08:43.314
Hey, I don't want you to sweat blood.

08:43.689 --> 08:45.900
I don't want to sue nobody neither, but...

08:46.692 --> 08:49.362
I'm-I'm in trouble,
and you cops are responsible.

08:49.445 --> 08:50.988
How's that, Mr. Joyner?

08:51.072 --> 08:53.783
I got busted a couple of nights ago
on my way home from a game.

08:54.575 --> 08:56.536
The cop said something about a robbery.

08:57.328 --> 08:59.914
Took me back to a liquor store,

08:59.997 --> 09:02.041
white kid worked behind there,
saying I'm the one.

09:02.792 --> 09:03.709
And you had dough on you?

09:03.793 --> 09:05.169
From shooting the craps.

09:05.503 --> 09:08.047
And I had a gun,
which I have a permit for!

09:08.130 --> 09:10.174
Last gig was security guard, you know?

09:10.258 --> 09:12.969
Yeah, well, the cops, your PD,
they check out the craps game?

09:13.052 --> 09:13.970
They find any witnesses?

09:14.053 --> 09:16.764
Floating game like that,
you never see them dudes again.

09:16.847 --> 09:18.766
Mr. Joyner, do you have a criminal record?

09:18.849 --> 09:21.769
One conviction 12 years ago
for fighting, but that's-that's it.

09:22.270 --> 09:24.772
Detective, I am innocent.

09:24.855 --> 09:27.441
I mean, the guy said
he was robbed for $200.

09:27.525 --> 09:28.859
I had $400 on me.

09:28.943 --> 09:31.445
What am I doing robbing him
if I'm holding $200?

09:31.529 --> 09:32.989
You could have robbed
someplace else before.

09:33.072 --> 09:36.075
Oh, come on! Give me a break!
I got a wife and three kids to feed.

09:36.158 --> 09:39.495
All I'm asking is you help me with this,
and I'll drop my whole injury case.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.247
You forget you ever said that, okay?

09:41.330 --> 09:44.000
No, no, no, I will not forget I said that.

09:44.500 --> 09:48.796
Please, I cannot go to prison
for something I did not do.

09:49.505 --> 09:50.631
All right, look, I'll tell you what,

09:52.174 --> 09:54.594
if the arrest report backs up
what you say, then I'll investigate.

09:54.677 --> 09:57.597
Now, I'm not gonna get you off.
I'm not gonna change anything.

09:58.055 --> 09:59.015
Investigate.

09:59.098 --> 10:02.560
You investigate, and you get
no lawsuit from me, brother.

10:03.311 --> 10:05.146
Simple logic of war, Captain.

10:05.229 --> 10:07.356
Treaties expire,
and people trying to jockey for position

10:07.440 --> 10:08.899
to be in power on the new treaties.

10:08.983 --> 10:11.360
I am fully aware of the reasons
for these incidents.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.571
I'm here to tell you all
they're not gonna be tolerated.

10:14.238 --> 10:18.326
What you want the dudes to understand is
jockeying ain't gonna pay.

10:19.410 --> 10:20.745
It's like in my job program.

10:22.163 --> 10:25.291
Ain't no way anybody does trouble
they gonna get a job.

10:25.374 --> 10:26.876
Man lies like a Blood.

10:27.835 --> 10:29.086
Excuse me?

10:29.170 --> 10:31.047
Everybody knows where
the problem's at, Peabody,

10:31.839 --> 10:32.757
with a capital "P."

10:33.215 --> 10:35.635
You're giving the jobs to the Blood,
you're selling the jobs out.

10:36.594 --> 10:38.262
Jobs go to who's qualified, man.

10:38.346 --> 10:39.388
Lies.

10:41.265 --> 10:43.893
You're lying... <i>maricón.</i>

10:53.069 --> 10:55.821
A previous week,
this individual and I had a situation.

10:55.905 --> 10:57.156
(people grumbling)

10:57.239 --> 10:59.909
Dude got noisy, I had to administer
an amount of discipline.

11:00.409 --> 11:01.619
Ain't that right, Ernesto?

11:02.495 --> 11:03.954
Had to put you in line, didn't I?

11:04.872 --> 11:06.457
You lose your colors, punk?

11:06.540 --> 11:08.793
What's dumber than a Diablo
is a Diablo without his jacket, man.

11:08.876 --> 11:10.419
(speaking in Spanish)

11:10.503 --> 11:12.797
A lot of jackets,
a lot of time's gonna bring you down.

11:12.880 --> 11:14.590
Do you understand? Do you--

11:15.508 --> 11:17.051
Stay! Stay right there!

11:17.134 --> 11:18.803
(all shouting)

11:23.557 --> 11:24.392
Natalie?

11:26.060 --> 11:27.228
See how you think this reads.

11:28.521 --> 11:32.942
"To misplaced love,
although the miles may squash the smiles

11:33.025 --> 11:37.196
we shared so long ago,
and you're in Vegas and I'm not,

11:37.697 --> 11:39.740
my heart still aches for you so.

11:40.783 --> 11:45.287
So, roll the dice, I'll take that chance
and tend the window's light,

11:45.955 --> 11:51.127
but if you crap out, just remember,
I'll always be here, Myrna."

11:52.253 --> 11:53.796
What do you think?
I want to work on the end a little.

11:53.879 --> 11:55.548
-It's cute, Leo.
-Cute?

11:55.631 --> 11:57.425
-I mean, it's nice.
-So you like it?

11:57.508 --> 11:59.093
Yeah. Are you gonna send it then?

11:59.844 --> 12:02.304
-Maybe I should work on it some more.
-It could only get better.

12:02.596 --> 12:05.558
You're right, the ending definitely needs
a little more oomph.

12:05.641 --> 12:08.018
I don't know. Have we made any progress?

12:08.102 --> 12:09.270
It's a powder keg.

12:09.353 --> 12:11.689
Get me a breakdown
of Youth Corps job offers

12:11.772 --> 12:13.566
by gang, and if possible, racial.

12:16.026 --> 12:17.361
Lucky they stopped you, chump.

12:17.903 --> 12:21.365
You come around looking for a job
the right way, maybe you get it.

12:21.449 --> 12:23.409
What's up, man? Have to pay you off?

12:23.492 --> 12:25.661
Go ahead. Be the fool, man.

12:26.704 --> 12:28.372
Maybe you're the fool, Peabody.

12:31.417 --> 12:33.753
(shouting)

12:36.839 --> 12:38.090
Stop! Stop it!

12:39.967 --> 12:42.344
All right, that's it. You're busted, man.

12:42.428 --> 12:45.139
Let him go, man. Hey, let him go!
I'll take care of him!

12:45.222 --> 12:47.266
-I can take care of him!
-JESUS: Hey, Nesto!

12:50.227 --> 12:51.687
Stop acting like a kid.

12:51.771 --> 12:52.980
Got something to say to me, man?

12:53.063 --> 12:55.024
I'm wearing the colors. I'm a member here.

12:55.107 --> 12:58.819
And I'm getting nothing from you.
You ain't doing nothing.

12:58.903 --> 12:59.945
What do you mean?

13:00.029 --> 13:02.698
I need the Diablo leader to be a man.

13:03.741 --> 13:05.534
Big talk for a kid, Nesto.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.995
NESTO: Aw, the hell with you, man.
You ain't gonna do nothing.

13:08.829 --> 13:11.916
I heard Marcus.
He said he'd give you the job.

13:12.208 --> 13:15.044
Now you want me to go to him and say,
"Don't give him the job"?

13:15.127 --> 13:16.629
(speaking in Spanish)

13:16.712 --> 13:18.339
What kind of satisfaction do you want?

13:18.422 --> 13:20.132
NESTO: Not the job, man!

13:20.758 --> 13:21.801
Let's go home.

13:21.884 --> 13:23.260
No!

13:23.344 --> 13:25.721
-(speaking Spanish)
-I say the hell with you!

13:37.233 --> 13:40.861
(music playing)

13:47.159 --> 13:48.577
-Mr. Brandon.
-Yeah?

13:49.328 --> 13:53.082
Oh, Jimmy Lastarza.
We talked on the telephone.

13:53.791 --> 13:54.625
Right.

13:55.251 --> 13:57.419
So what's the matter? Why the long face?

13:57.503 --> 14:00.256
Well, uh, I'm not sure
I want those poker machines.

14:00.339 --> 14:02.174
You're not sure?
Well, that's why I'm here.

14:02.258 --> 14:07.096
I thought I might be able to persuade you,
so I brought along these, uh, statistics.

14:07.179 --> 14:09.139
Your guy already showed me
the brochure, Mr. Lastarza.

14:09.223 --> 14:11.267
That's, uh, not the problem.

14:11.851 --> 14:14.812
That's why I got mad at him.
He don't know how to close.

14:15.145 --> 14:18.440
Well, it, uh, it wasn't exactly
his fault, Mr. Lastarza.

14:18.524 --> 14:21.735
-I mean..
-Hey, Mr. Brandon, Mr. Brandon,

14:21.819 --> 14:24.488
you're looking at another
source of revenue.

14:24.864 --> 14:28.742
I mean, a 37 percent increase
in reported profitability,

14:28.826 --> 14:33.289
which between me, you, and the lamp post,
a cash business like these machines...

14:33.372 --> 14:36.500
I mean, when was the last time you heard
a guy report his last dime of profit?

14:36.584 --> 14:37.585
I'd love to make the dough.

14:37.668 --> 14:40.296
It's frankly...
I'm afraid to get involved.

14:40.379 --> 14:41.463
With what, Wally?

14:42.131 --> 14:42.965
With you fellows.

14:43.048 --> 14:44.049
-Wally!
-Look.

14:44.133 --> 14:47.177
I had trouble getting this license.
I did a two-year bit when I was a kid.

14:47.595 --> 14:49.388
There's all kinds of trouble, Wally.

14:49.471 --> 14:51.974
Statistics show
that various things can happen

14:52.057 --> 14:54.143
if you don't make the installations.

14:54.518 --> 14:55.436
Don't start with the threats.

14:55.519 --> 14:57.980
Statistics, they don't lie.

14:58.063 --> 15:00.733
Suddenly, I mean,
there's a drop-off of sales,

15:00.816 --> 15:04.069
clientele are going elsewhere
which has the poker machines

15:04.528 --> 15:08.073
to incidents of the smallest
wear and tear,

15:08.782 --> 15:11.243
to incidents of your physical layout...

15:12.620 --> 15:13.787
Hey-- Hey, come on!

15:15.539 --> 15:16.874
All the way to flame.

15:17.207 --> 15:18.709
That's enough.

15:19.877 --> 15:20.753
Look at this.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.130
A buttinsky.

15:23.213 --> 15:26.091
You know something?
Anybody can have an incident.

15:27.384 --> 15:29.094
Joey! Joey!

15:29.178 --> 15:31.013
-I'll cut his nose off!
-Joey, Joey.

15:31.096 --> 15:34.058
It's my face, Joey. Joey.
Joey, my face.

15:34.141 --> 15:34.975
Lay back.

15:36.018 --> 15:40.314
Now, Mr. Brandon had specific reservations
which you are not helping.

15:41.231 --> 15:42.733
How do you want me to help?

15:44.276 --> 15:46.737
-Wally?
-I'm afraid of losing control of my joint.

15:46.820 --> 15:49.114
Well, we'll put it on a trial basis.

15:49.990 --> 15:51.533
He puts them in for a month.

15:51.617 --> 15:54.411
After that, he can have them removed,
no questions asked.

15:54.495 --> 15:57.247
Great, great. Fifty percent apiece.

15:57.331 --> 15:58.916
-Wally?
-Enough is enough!

15:58.999 --> 16:00.626
-Wally!
-Okay!

16:01.001 --> 16:02.252
All right, you got a deal.

16:10.886 --> 16:12.346
-What's your name?
-Mike.

16:12.930 --> 16:13.764
Mike what?

16:14.932 --> 16:16.850
-Fleischer.
-You his partner?

16:18.185 --> 16:20.938
He's got a note with me.
I'm just supervising my interests.

16:21.689 --> 16:23.440
You want I should call for the machines?

16:24.191 --> 16:26.068
Yeah, go get the machines, Joey.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.410
You're an excitable guy, Mike.

16:43.627 --> 16:47.631
Well, I don't wish to sound prejudiced,
sir, but take a look at that.

16:48.340 --> 16:53.762
I call that one of the most stately steeds
that ever took bit between teeth.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.889
I'm to understand you purchased the horse?

16:55.973 --> 16:58.684
Yes, and I wish to donate
his services to the city

16:58.767 --> 17:01.562
along with five dollars per diem
towards his stable costs.

17:01.645 --> 17:03.605
May I ask why you are making this offer?

17:03.689 --> 17:06.650
Budgetary effectiveness
is my language, too, gentlemen.

17:06.734 --> 17:08.652
Compare the benefits to the commonweal

17:08.736 --> 17:12.072
of this partially subsidized
equine strike force

17:12.156 --> 17:14.867
versus the numerous budget items
contained in here,

17:14.950 --> 17:16.452
which constitute little more

17:16.535 --> 17:19.038
than pitching tax dollars
into a blast furnace.

17:19.121 --> 17:24.043
Budgetary adipose, gentlemen,
most evident in line 39B,

17:24.126 --> 17:26.962
funding bilingual education for people

17:27.046 --> 17:31.133
whose first and last language
will always be preverbal.

17:31.216 --> 17:36.221
Or, uh, 57J, counseling services
for unwed mothers?

17:36.305 --> 17:37.431
Gentlemen, please.

17:37.723 --> 17:39.975
Provide them with scarlet letters,
if you wish--

17:40.059 --> 17:42.936
Hey, just wait one minute, buster!

17:43.353 --> 17:44.480
Excuse me, Fay?

17:44.563 --> 17:46.273
You've already spoken, ma'am.

17:46.356 --> 17:48.567
Yes, I know, but, you know,
you never let me finish.

17:48.650 --> 17:52.154
And besides, what I want to say
is that it's really unfair

17:52.237 --> 17:55.365
to push one program
by belittling the unwed mothers program.

17:55.449 --> 17:58.327
It's our job to decide
what's fair here, ma'am,

17:58.410 --> 18:00.996
and you may have noticed
that Lieutenant Hunter has the floor now.

18:01.080 --> 18:04.041
-Thank you, and now--
-Uh, excuse me one minute, Howard.

18:04.124 --> 18:08.670
But I wonder if these gentlemen would be
prepared to give up some of their goodies,

18:08.754 --> 18:11.715
you know, like their raises,
their junkets to Tokyo.

18:11.799 --> 18:13.884
Which happens to be our
sister city of the Orient

18:13.967 --> 18:15.511
and has much to offer in the way

18:15.594 --> 18:18.180
of rapid transit
and manufacturing expertise.

18:18.263 --> 18:21.850
Right, not to mention cheap pearls
and free vacations for the wives.

18:21.934 --> 18:24.812
You know, unwed mothers
get no goodies, gentlemen.

18:24.895 --> 18:28.023
The horse has a long
and noble history of conflict resolution.

18:28.107 --> 18:31.193
If you are so eager to see
how other people live,

18:31.276 --> 18:33.570
I suggest you take a junket
up to South Dekker,

18:34.154 --> 18:36.615
visit an unwed mother
living in that squalor

18:36.698 --> 18:38.909
with no heat, no food, no money,

18:38.992 --> 18:42.579
and most important,
no hope for her child's future.

18:43.247 --> 18:46.500
You know that the tax money
spent on one of your wives' plane tickets

18:46.583 --> 18:47.835
could feed them both for months.

18:47.918 --> 18:50.838
Ma'am, you're entirely out of order.
You have used up your allotment of time.

18:50.921 --> 18:52.047
I don't care!

18:52.756 --> 18:55.676
I refuse to sit in silence
while you let General Custer here

18:55.759 --> 18:59.513
convince you to do for horses
what you won't do for human beings!

18:59.596 --> 19:03.058
For the final time,
neither of those issues has been decided.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.644
However, despite what you
may think of this council,

19:05.727 --> 19:06.687
common sense should tell you

19:06.770 --> 19:08.730
that we're not going to rob
underprivileged citizens

19:08.814 --> 19:11.441
so that a handful of policemen
can play "Ride 'em, cowboy."

19:13.110 --> 19:14.361
That's very reassuring.

19:15.028 --> 19:15.863
Thank you.

19:17.781 --> 19:19.992
Lieutenant Hunter,
I believe you have one minute left.

19:20.325 --> 19:23.245
Uh, journey with me now,
back to the streets of Ancient Rome.

19:26.206 --> 19:27.916
Off to a wine tasting, huh?

19:28.417 --> 19:32.004
So, yeah, I've been held up
about six, eight times in two years.

19:32.087 --> 19:34.673
Look, excuse me if I lost count.
Why don't you tell me?

19:34.756 --> 19:36.508
Four times in the last four months.

19:36.592 --> 19:39.011
Look, I'm a liquor store.
I'm the only cash machine in town.

19:39.094 --> 19:41.430
-So what's new?
-Maybe you need a new set of gates.

19:41.513 --> 19:43.765
A new nephew, then gates.

19:43.849 --> 19:46.602
That'd be Sammy Morse, am I right?
Is he working today?

19:46.685 --> 19:49.438
Now, that's the $64,000 question.

19:49.980 --> 19:51.356
You want to make yourself useful?

19:51.440 --> 19:53.692
Why don't you find Sammy,
and I can go to lunch?

19:53.775 --> 19:57.279
My paperwork indicates that Mr. Morse
phoned in the last four robberies.

19:57.362 --> 19:59.448
Oh, he's good at that,
handing over my till.

19:59.531 --> 20:02.159
But ask him to put three cases
of Stoli in the back,

20:02.242 --> 20:04.036
and he comes out with the coughs,
he's got the drips,

20:04.119 --> 20:05.454
plus, he's got to go out for fresh air,

20:05.537 --> 20:09.374
and plus, if you go count the stock
the next day, there's only two cases.

20:09.458 --> 20:10.918
Lookit, don't get me started here.

20:11.001 --> 20:12.461
Okay, so why don't you get rid of the guy?

20:12.544 --> 20:15.047
I'm gonna go to my sister's house
for Thanksgiving dinner

20:15.130 --> 20:16.715
after I fire her little Sammy?

20:16.798 --> 20:18.300
Okay, look, would you do me a favor?

20:18.383 --> 20:19.509
If Mr. Morse comes in today,

20:19.593 --> 20:22.471
would you have him call
Detective Garibaldi at this number?

20:22.554 --> 20:25.224
Sure. If he comes in sometime this year.

20:30.896 --> 20:33.106
Mr. Brandon, Mr. Franco.

20:33.523 --> 20:35.400
-Wally Brandon.
-Where's this Mike?

20:35.901 --> 20:37.861
-That's the guy I want to meet.
-I'm right here.

20:38.362 --> 20:40.113
-You're Mike?
-Yeah. What's your name?

20:40.197 --> 20:41.907
Nice to meet you. Lester Franco.

20:41.990 --> 20:43.283
Nice to meet you, Lester.

20:43.992 --> 20:47.371
So, Mr. Brandon,
I understand we got a trial marriage.

20:47.454 --> 20:50.040
-A 30-day, no-fault arrangement.
-BRANDON: Right.

20:50.123 --> 20:51.208
Run it down for him, Jimmy.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.670
Well, the machines don't pay off
when somebody wins.

20:54.753 --> 20:56.797
You got to pay them from your register.

20:57.214 --> 20:59.216
Which the machines track the payoffs.

20:59.299 --> 21:03.053
Don't cheat your partners.
You partners with this fellow, Mike?

21:03.136 --> 21:05.430
No, I just made him a loan to get started.

21:05.514 --> 21:09.434
Yeah, Jimmy tells me you might have
an interest in making some other loans.

21:09.518 --> 21:10.936
You might want to put
some dough on the street.

21:11.019 --> 21:12.646
That's a definite possibility.

21:13.230 --> 21:15.065
Because we have ways to make that happen.

21:15.482 --> 21:18.235
We have a steady stream
of loan applicants which we get from--

21:18.318 --> 21:19.945
Help us out on that machine
over there, please?

21:20.028 --> 21:21.822
-MAN: Right now.
-Y'all open for business?

21:21.905 --> 21:23.156
MAN 2: Yeah. Go ahead, break it in.

21:23.240 --> 21:25.075
-Bobby!
-Cowboy, you get 'em!

21:25.158 --> 21:26.743
-Two sodas.
-What do I do now?

21:26.827 --> 21:28.578
-A buck and a half.
-What's the problem?

21:28.829 --> 21:30.998
Well, I got two kings, an ace,
and two little ones.

21:31.081 --> 21:32.958
LASTARZA: Well, push the buttons
under what you want to keep,

21:33.041 --> 21:35.460
punch "draw",
and you'll get a couple more cards.

21:35.544 --> 21:36.962
-Okay.
-BARTENDER: You play those?

21:37.045 --> 21:38.463
Ah, it's too hard for me to stop.

21:38.547 --> 21:39.923
I'm that way with cookies.

21:40.007 --> 21:41.466
Hot dog, look at this.

21:41.550 --> 21:42.884
-What happened?
-Full house.

21:42.968 --> 21:44.845
You see that? Those machines are loose.

21:45.387 --> 21:47.306
-I won.
-It pays 30 to one.

21:47.389 --> 21:48.432
Pay the man off, Wally.

21:48.515 --> 21:50.183
Hey, pay the man, Wally!

21:50.267 --> 21:53.395
All right, that's it!
This establishment is closed.

21:53.478 --> 21:54.521
Oh, man!

21:54.604 --> 21:56.315
Lady, lady, what is the deal here?

21:56.398 --> 21:59.067
This bar is being padlocked
for violation of the state liquor law,

21:59.151 --> 22:01.111
gambling on the premises.
Patrons are asked to leave--

22:01.194 --> 22:03.405
-Ma'am, you don't--
-Now don't give me a hard time, sir.

22:03.488 --> 22:04.823
Lady, what about my 30 to one?

22:04.906 --> 22:06.616
You can turn it into 30 days
if you like, pal.

22:06.700 --> 22:07.826
Oh, I can, can I?

22:07.909 --> 22:09.578
WOMAN:
Interfering with a state liquor authority.

22:09.661 --> 22:12.039
This is a travesty!
This is a miscarriage of justice.

22:12.122 --> 22:15.208
-Take your buddy outside, sir.
-You hear me, lady? I said a miscarriage!

22:15.584 --> 22:16.543
-Are you the owners here?
-No.

22:16.626 --> 22:18.337
-No, ma'am.
-I'd suggest you leave.

22:18.670 --> 22:19.546
You see this, Mike?

22:19.629 --> 22:22.132
This here's a great argument
for diversification.

22:22.215 --> 22:23.258
Let's you and I talk.

22:24.968 --> 22:28.764
There was an ensuing scuffle,
during which Marcus backed Officer Davis

22:28.847 --> 22:30.057
into a shard of glass.

22:30.140 --> 22:31.308
Inadvertently?

22:31.391 --> 22:32.225
It appeared so.

22:36.229 --> 22:37.189
Are you all right?

22:37.606 --> 22:39.900
Yeah. It's, uh, just a Band-Aid cut.

22:39.983 --> 22:42.361
Rudy, any objections
if we don't bring charges?

22:42.569 --> 22:43.403
No, none here.

22:44.112 --> 22:46.823
I grabbed the guy, he got a little hot.
It happens.

22:47.532 --> 22:48.658
Okay, thanks. That's all.

22:49.076 --> 22:49.951
Thank you.

22:55.999 --> 22:57.000
I appreciate that, Frank.

22:57.084 --> 23:00.420
Mr. Mayor, I have to be honest with you.
I think you have a problem with Peabody.

23:00.504 --> 23:03.507
Frank, we both know this kid's background.
He's come a long way.

23:03.590 --> 23:04.966
I want to give him a shot.

23:05.050 --> 23:06.510
-I'd like to see him work out.
-So would I.

23:06.593 --> 23:11.306
But in the meantime, his temper aside,
I keep hearing allegations of corruption.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.266
That he's hiring only
members of his own gang.

23:13.350 --> 23:14.434
Will you check that out for me?

23:14.518 --> 23:15.560
We're doing that.

23:15.644 --> 23:18.105
-How are you doing on treaty renewal?
-We're trying.

23:18.188 --> 23:19.689
I noticed a bump in incidents.

23:19.773 --> 23:21.650
It always happens
when they're about to expire.

23:21.733 --> 23:23.402
Can I take Peabody with me?

23:23.485 --> 23:25.404
Yeah. They should be releasing him soon.

23:28.323 --> 23:29.157
Thanks, Frank.

23:33.161 --> 23:35.330
Since when do you people
move on a place without notifying us?

23:35.414 --> 23:36.665
I could ask you the same question.

23:36.748 --> 23:37.999
There's a slight difference.

23:38.417 --> 23:41.545
Not only did you compromise an operation,
you put officers at risk.

23:41.628 --> 23:43.922
Which wouldn't have happened
if I'd known the guys were in there.

23:44.005 --> 23:45.966
Which you would've known,
had you bothered to check.

23:46.049 --> 23:48.593
Okay, so the left hand ought to know
what the right hand is doing.

23:48.677 --> 23:50.804
And maybe that would be the case,
if it wasn't for the fact

23:50.887 --> 23:52.973
that the left hand has been known
to dip into the wrong pocket.

23:53.056 --> 23:54.808
As opposed to the spotless record
of your department?

23:54.891 --> 23:55.725
Okay.

23:56.518 --> 23:59.271
So, now we both see
how this situation could happen.

23:59.354 --> 24:00.480
Let's get one thing straight.

24:00.564 --> 24:02.607
This isn't Jerry Fuchs
you're dealing with now.

24:02.774 --> 24:03.733
Whatever happened before is history.

24:03.817 --> 24:05.569
I don't want to have our people
jeopardized because of it.

24:05.652 --> 24:06.778
Okay, I hear you.

24:06.862 --> 24:08.780
I still have people out there,
and I don't want you anywhere near them.

24:08.864 --> 24:10.615
In fact, I want to know every move
you make from here on out.

24:10.699 --> 24:13.493
Okay, all right. Sorry about the mix-up.

24:20.542 --> 24:22.669
Friendly crowd up here.

24:22.752 --> 24:24.504
See you later.

24:26.840 --> 24:28.800
Mr. Brandon,
I'm trying to get up to speed on--

24:28.884 --> 24:30.177
You're trying to get up to speed?

24:30.427 --> 24:32.637
I get approached by some muscle guys,
I come to you people,

24:32.721 --> 24:34.806
and I wind up closed
and my license is gone!

24:34.890 --> 24:36.766
My best understanding
is that the state liquor authority

24:36.850 --> 24:38.560
was unaware that we had an undercover--

24:38.643 --> 24:40.395
Why? Don't all you people
speak the same language?

24:40.479 --> 24:41.688
Don't you all talk bribe?

24:41.771 --> 24:46.109
Now, look, we're gonna do the best we can
to get you open as fast as we can.

24:46.193 --> 24:49.446
Great, and who's gonna put food
on my table, meantime, and pay my bills?

24:49.529 --> 24:50.906
I'm really very sorry about that,

24:51.239 --> 24:53.450
but I can promise you
we're gonna try to straighten it out.

24:53.533 --> 24:54.993
That's it? You're gonna try?

24:55.076 --> 24:57.078
That's it! I'll keep you posted.

24:57.746 --> 24:58.914
Go be a citizen.

25:00.999 --> 25:02.709
-(door slams)
-Guy's really getting a bum shake.

25:02.792 --> 25:03.919
No argument, Mick.

25:04.628 --> 25:05.629
Did your cover hold?

25:06.296 --> 25:07.172
Yeah, I think so.

25:07.255 --> 25:08.340
How did you leave it with them?

25:09.799 --> 25:12.677
I'm supposed to go
to this other joint this afternoon.

25:13.595 --> 25:16.097
Excuse me, Neal?
Neal, can I talk to you for a sec?

25:16.181 --> 25:18.350
Yeah, sure.
Talk with you later, Terri, okay?

25:18.934 --> 25:20.435
All right, I pulled all the papers.

25:20.727 --> 25:23.730
Now, this Floyd's a clean family guy,
and the liquor store clerk is a bum.

25:23.813 --> 25:25.524
Hey, look, you haven't even
talked to the guy, Harry.

25:25.607 --> 25:26.858
Right. He didn't call.

25:26.942 --> 25:29.319
Now, I'm telling you,
his own uncle thinks he's a total bum.

25:29.402 --> 25:31.613
From the description,
he sounds like a druggie.

25:31.696 --> 25:32.739
I'm gonna run his BCI--

25:32.822 --> 25:34.574
Harry, Captain wants to
see you right away.

25:37.953 --> 25:41.164
Natalie? I've been working on the poem.
Do you want to hear the new version?

25:41.248 --> 25:43.416
-Do I have to?
-I really punched it up.

25:43.500 --> 25:45.961
Leo, look,
I really hate saying this, you know.

25:46.336 --> 25:48.088
But I think you're kidding yourself.

25:48.171 --> 25:50.715
Your wife bought a ticket to Vegas,
and it was one-way.

25:51.174 --> 25:52.008
Yeah.

25:52.801 --> 25:54.678
I mean, you ought to get on
with your own life.

25:54.761 --> 25:56.888
-You're right.
-What do you do at night?

25:57.764 --> 26:00.642
I don't know. I got my Dice Baseball set.

26:00.725 --> 26:01.560
Yeah?

26:02.018 --> 26:04.187
Yeah, there's a hot pennant race on,
so that's a plus.

26:04.271 --> 26:05.605
You ever play an away game?

26:06.815 --> 26:07.649
What?

26:07.732 --> 26:09.276
Why don't you play at my ballpark tonight?

26:09.359 --> 26:12.153
Do you like chicken in a pot?
It's only leftovers, but...

26:12.237 --> 26:13.488
It's better the second time.

26:13.822 --> 26:16.658
Leo! Mind pulling the duty lists?

26:16.992 --> 26:18.034
We got shots fired down at that

26:18.118 --> 26:19.953
-job corps storefront.
-Yeah, sure.

26:20.036 --> 26:23.540
Yes, the clerk called. Yes, he's angry.

26:24.207 --> 26:25.584
Claims you're trying to get him fired.

26:25.667 --> 26:27.502
-Not true, Captain.
-What were you doing there?

26:27.711 --> 26:29.087
An ongoing investigation.

26:29.170 --> 26:30.422
Your ongoing investigation?

26:30.505 --> 26:32.924
I also received a call
from O'Malley on the night shift.

26:33.008 --> 26:34.467
He claims you're trying
to mix in on his case.

26:34.551 --> 26:37.220
Yeah, well, if he'd done some police work
on it, then I wouldn't have to.

26:37.304 --> 26:39.431
Hey, I spoke to O'Malley.
I didn't go behind his back.

26:39.514 --> 26:41.725
And he told you politely to back off.

26:41.808 --> 26:43.393
Well, I'm telling you
a little less politely.

26:43.476 --> 26:46.563
What happened this morning between you
and the defendant, Floyd Joyner?

26:46.813 --> 26:48.023
Had a little fender bender.

26:48.690 --> 26:50.442
(laughing) My insurance was expired.

26:50.525 --> 26:53.320
Putting aside that
that's a VTL misdemeanor,

26:53.403 --> 26:55.155
how in the hell do you think it looks
with you out there

26:55.238 --> 26:56.573
trying to clear the guy of a rap?

26:56.656 --> 26:58.658
What's next, plea-bargaining
hookers in the backseat?

26:58.742 --> 27:01.328
Wait, there's no deal between me
and Mr. Joyner, Captain.

27:01.411 --> 27:02.370
I think that the man is innocent.

27:02.454 --> 27:05.498
I say there is a deal whether you agreed
to it in words or not.

27:05.582 --> 27:06.625
Stay away from it.

27:07.417 --> 27:08.668
-The man is innocent.
-Stay away.

27:10.128 --> 27:12.881
(sirens wailing)

27:12.964 --> 27:16.217
(tires screeching)

27:16.301 --> 27:18.470
Hey! He's got a gun! He's crazy!

27:19.012 --> 27:20.347
What's going on? What happened?

27:20.430 --> 27:23.600
This punk kid comes in and said
he had an appointment to see Marcus.

27:24.100 --> 27:25.060
-Marcus Peabody?
-Right.

27:25.143 --> 27:26.311
-Who's the kid?
-Diablo.

27:26.394 --> 27:28.355
That crazy freak
that jumped him this morning.

27:28.438 --> 27:31.232
I knew something was wrong with the dude.
I knew something was wrong.

27:31.316 --> 27:33.276
Marcus didn't let him in,
though, you know?

27:33.360 --> 27:36.404
-So he goes in. Starts to shout.
-Yeah, Unit 2203.

27:36.488 --> 27:39.407
We have a hostage situation
at the Youth Corps job center.

27:39.491 --> 27:41.743
A Diablo kid has Marcus Peabody.

27:41.826 --> 27:43.828
NESTO: Hey! You tell Jesus Martinez

27:43.912 --> 27:46.289
he don't want to take care
of business, I'm gonna do it!

27:46.373 --> 27:48.917
You hear me? I'll kill him!

27:49.000 --> 27:50.335
Somebody better get Martinez in here.

27:50.418 --> 27:52.045
NESTO: I'm taking care of business!

27:57.592 --> 27:59.928
Is it manageable in terms
of backups, Henry?

28:00.011 --> 28:01.721
Seems to be, for now.

28:01.805 --> 28:03.723
All right, then Howard
should be there in 20 minutes.

28:03.807 --> 28:06.184
Any kind of break, Frank.
I think we're gonna get the kid out.

28:08.603 --> 28:10.188
-Sergeant.
-Sergeant.

28:10.271 --> 28:11.439
Irwin. Judge Wachtel.

28:11.898 --> 28:13.817
Cut the ceremony, Frank. You call me Alan.

28:13.900 --> 28:15.527
This is gonna shock you, Frank.

28:15.610 --> 28:17.779
We have been having
communications problems

28:17.862 --> 28:19.406
-among the enforcement arms.
-More?

28:19.489 --> 28:22.701
I.E. more than the SLA foul-up
at your undercover bar?

28:23.243 --> 28:26.413
No, I guess you could say
this is all part of the same foul-up.

28:27.205 --> 28:29.082
We have been moving on Lester Franco.

28:29.582 --> 28:32.460
The one productive thing
that came out of a shouting session

28:32.544 --> 28:34.504
I had with those SLA people
this afternoon,

28:34.587 --> 28:36.965
was that you also have been
moving on Lester Franco.

28:37.048 --> 28:39.884
Damn it, Irwin!
This kind of crap is not funny.

28:39.968 --> 28:41.177
I have men out there at risk.

28:41.261 --> 28:44.139
Franco approached Wachtel
to toss a South Ferry bust

28:44.222 --> 28:45.306
on these video-poker games.

28:45.390 --> 28:48.476
Whatever they expected, Frank,
based on heaven knows what past history,

28:49.144 --> 28:52.522
Dorothy Wachtel
did not raise a corrupt jurist.

28:52.605 --> 28:55.108
Alan had agreed
to wear a wire on these guys.

28:55.191 --> 28:57.360
We had arranged a meeting for tonight
at the Lucky Duce.

28:57.444 --> 28:59.487
God help me.
I think I'm becoming an excitement junkie.

28:59.571 --> 29:01.489
This should have been
coordinated earlier, Frank.

29:01.573 --> 29:03.450
We are trying to coordinate it now.

29:03.533 --> 29:06.619
We have moved the liquor authority
proceeding onto Alan's docket.

29:06.703 --> 29:09.414
We want to make sure we're not gonna bump
into anything of yours.

29:09.497 --> 29:10.832
I'll call you at the end of business.

29:10.915 --> 29:13.543
Hey, let's not cop an attitude, Frank!

29:14.043 --> 29:16.045
I'm the one that's
going onto the front line!

29:16.129 --> 29:19.215
I'm having Belker inventory his cover.
I'll call you when I know.

29:19.299 --> 29:20.133
Fine. Good.

29:21.634 --> 29:22.469
I'm sorry.

29:23.136 --> 29:25.430
I'm sorry, Frank. I-- I really am.

29:25.889 --> 29:28.433
-I'm sure Belker's playing hardball, too.
-IRWIN: Alan.

29:28.516 --> 29:30.769
-Hey, we're all on the front lines.
-Judge!

29:33.188 --> 29:34.022
Neal.

29:34.481 --> 29:36.649
Neal, look at the BCI
on the liquor-store clerk.

29:37.233 --> 29:39.194
We got New Haven, Connecticut,
larceny one.

29:39.277 --> 29:40.278
He copped to the mis.

29:40.361 --> 29:44.032
Dope, heroin,
another larceny one, all dismissed.

29:44.324 --> 29:45.909
-Call New Haven and see what it was?
-Not yet.

29:45.992 --> 29:48.286
Aw, Harry! Sit down, man.

29:50.455 --> 29:51.790
Now, you do Mendoza, okay?

29:55.668 --> 29:57.003
BELKER: <i>It's a nice place.</i>

29:57.086 --> 29:58.129
How come it's not open?

29:58.213 --> 30:01.466
We don't like to stay open too long, Mike.
Four hours a night.

30:01.549 --> 30:03.218
I use it more like an office, Mike.

30:03.676 --> 30:05.804
We've been here now more than 16 years.

30:06.179 --> 30:07.639
Give me a 7 and 7, would ya?

30:07.889 --> 30:09.933
This one the liquor authority don't close.

30:10.016 --> 30:11.643
(chuckles)

30:11.726 --> 30:13.186
You had no inkling they were after you?

30:13.269 --> 30:14.270
None whatsoever.

30:15.146 --> 30:17.690
Because usually you can smell
something like that in the wind.

30:17.941 --> 30:18.775
No.

30:20.151 --> 30:20.985
Whatever.

30:21.903 --> 30:23.238
Step into my office.

30:23.947 --> 30:26.324
You know, we think we can
open you up again pretty quick.

30:26.407 --> 30:28.076
(chuckles) How you gonna do that?

30:28.660 --> 30:30.245
Something with the judiciary.

30:30.328 --> 30:32.872
In the meantime,
we want you to get well again.

30:33.331 --> 30:34.666
We want to put your money to work.

30:34.749 --> 30:36.000
Good, good, uh--

30:36.668 --> 30:39.546
Because I thought maybe
you would figure I was bad luck.

30:39.629 --> 30:41.714
There's no such thing as that, Michael.

30:41.798 --> 30:42.715
I don't believe in it.

30:42.799 --> 30:45.969
We'd provide you with applicants
and collection assistance.

30:46.052 --> 30:49.055
You make loans up to ten G's,
you give us three points a month.

30:49.138 --> 30:50.723
Anything over that,
you pay us two and a half.

30:50.807 --> 30:52.725
I don't need any help with collections.

30:53.268 --> 30:54.269
Tough guy.

30:55.478 --> 30:57.146
Suppose you get a postcard from Florida.

30:57.230 --> 31:00.525
(sighs) Yeah, you're right. You're right.

31:00.608 --> 31:02.694
You can never have too much help, Michael.

31:03.069 --> 31:04.612
You can never be too well-connected.

31:04.696 --> 31:05.780
I'm in.

31:05.864 --> 31:06.948
Thataboy.

31:12.954 --> 31:15.373
Hey, hey, hey, sorry.
Just about to close for a few minutes.

31:15.456 --> 31:17.417
-Let's close then.
-Hey, no, seriously.

31:17.500 --> 31:18.543
Sammy Morse, right?

31:19.419 --> 31:21.337
Who, uh... (sniffs) wants to know?

31:21.671 --> 31:22.797
Got a few questions.

31:23.381 --> 31:24.841
What's the matter? You got a cold, Sammy?

31:24.924 --> 31:27.594
Oh, man, I talked to you guys
a hundred times already.

31:27.677 --> 31:28.887
Ever been to New Haven, Sammy?

31:28.970 --> 31:31.097
See, we made a few calls
to the New Haven cops.

31:31.180 --> 31:32.265
Found out you worked
in a liquor store, right?

31:32.348 --> 31:34.017
-Wait a minute.
-About this larceny bit.

31:34.100 --> 31:35.894
Is that right what they say
you were doing, Sammy?

31:35.977 --> 31:37.604
-Skimming the till like that?
-Hey, I wasn't--

31:37.687 --> 31:39.564
You claimed that somebody
kept holding you up.

31:39.647 --> 31:40.481
-No, I--
-The fourth time,

31:40.565 --> 31:41.733
they found the cash in your car.

31:41.816 --> 31:44.736
Six months later,
you get busted on the same shot in Albany.

31:44.819 --> 31:47.280
-I got my rights.
-Only cost you three months, Sam.

31:47.363 --> 31:48.781
But now you're doing it here, Sam.

31:49.240 --> 31:50.575
And it's your third time around, too.

31:50.658 --> 31:52.535
You know you could go away
for a pretty good stretch, my man?

31:52.619 --> 31:55.330
-Hey, Sammy.
-Hey, Teddy.

31:55.413 --> 31:56.539
What's happening, man?

31:56.623 --> 31:58.833
Hey, hey. I was just looking to get some--

31:58.917 --> 32:00.960
Uh, no good, bro. Hey, what's the matter?

32:01.044 --> 32:01.878
You dealing to Sammy?

32:01.961 --> 32:02.962
Don't get nervous, Sammy,

32:03.046 --> 32:04.797
just put your hands on the counter.
You, too, man.

32:04.881 --> 32:07.091
Oh, man, this is lame. Booze is legal!

32:07.467 --> 32:09.761
Whoo! Lookie here.

32:09.844 --> 32:12.096
-Lookie here, my man.
-Oh, man...

32:12.180 --> 32:14.641
Uh-huh, pretty expensive habit
you got here, Sammy.

32:14.724 --> 32:16.935
You have to dig pretty deep
in your pocket, don't you?

32:17.018 --> 32:19.604
You have to dip into your uncle's pocket,
too, ain't that right?

32:19.687 --> 32:20.563
-Yeah.
-What's that?

32:21.314 --> 32:23.149
-Can't hear you, Sammy.
-Yeah, yeah! I said yeah!

32:23.232 --> 32:24.984
Uh-uh, no stickup, right?

32:25.068 --> 32:27.570
Just Sammy picking up
the tab for his jones.

32:27.654 --> 32:29.989
Put your head back down on the counter.
You, too, chump.

32:30.073 --> 32:31.449
You look pretty tired to me.

32:32.784 --> 32:35.828
Listen, Nesto,
you do the right thing, bro.

32:36.204 --> 32:39.207
That's right.
They'll be other days better than this.

32:39.290 --> 32:41.084
Your grievances have been heard, Ernesto.

32:41.167 --> 32:43.962
I promise you something's gonna be done
about your situation.

32:44.045 --> 32:45.296
Nobody has to get hurt.

32:45.380 --> 32:47.131
No! No more damage.

32:47.215 --> 32:48.299
(chattering)

32:48.383 --> 32:50.259
-Status?
-Henry's got the kid positioned,

32:50.343 --> 32:51.803
but his adrenaline is running dry.

32:51.886 --> 32:54.055
-We can get him out, Frank.
-How's Peabody?

32:54.138 --> 32:55.556
He's all right. We can hear him.

32:55.640 --> 32:56.599
Who's the punk?

32:56.683 --> 32:59.811
Uh, Ernesto Monteblanco. He's a Diablo.

32:59.894 --> 33:02.814
Incident this morning.
The kid took a swing at him.

33:03.314 --> 33:05.316
You walk out of here tall, now.

33:05.733 --> 33:07.360
-Henry?
-Listen, Nesto.

33:07.443 --> 33:08.653
You got friends out here.

33:08.736 --> 33:10.446
-He want anything specific?
-A safe place.

33:10.530 --> 33:12.073
His dignity back.

33:13.241 --> 33:14.158
That's right.

33:15.201 --> 33:17.495
Ernesto, you ready to do
what we talked about now?

33:17.578 --> 33:19.122
CLEVELAND:
Did Marcus provoke this in any way?

33:19.205 --> 33:20.039
HOWARD: Not that we know of.

33:20.123 --> 33:22.417
The impression is Peabody's
standing him down.

33:22.500 --> 33:23.459
Okay?

33:25.545 --> 33:27.046
He's putting it down, and he's coming out.

33:29.298 --> 33:31.009
OFFICER (over radio):
<i>Okay, don't play games.</i>

33:31.718 --> 33:33.636
-(gunshots)
-(screaming)

33:35.930 --> 33:37.223
It's all right. Don't shoot.

33:40.601 --> 33:41.728
All right, it's cool. It's cool.

33:43.896 --> 33:45.064
Chump made a mistake.

33:45.565 --> 33:46.399
Howard.

33:46.482 --> 33:48.860
Ballantine! Coffey, Davis!

33:49.944 --> 33:50.778
It's all right.

33:51.362 --> 33:52.405
Hand down. Hand down.

33:57.410 --> 33:59.454
MAN: We found the suspect. He's down.

34:02.415 --> 34:03.666
Get him the hell out of here.

34:05.710 --> 34:06.544
Dammit!

34:08.588 --> 34:09.505
He's finished.

34:11.841 --> 34:13.384
Get me the hell out of here, too.

34:15.136 --> 34:17.638
You're damn right I took the chance, man.
He already fired on me twice.

34:17.722 --> 34:20.099
Wait a second. Wait a second.

34:20.183 --> 34:22.060
Hadn't he indicated he was
about to surrender?

34:22.143 --> 34:24.270
Hey, man, look, I'm no mind-reader.
The kid had a piece on me.

34:24.353 --> 34:25.897
My understanding was he'd lowered the gun.

34:25.980 --> 34:29.358
Hey, look, I self-defended myself.
All right? Anything wrong with that?

34:29.442 --> 34:32.737
Now, I wait for you, maybe you talk him
into this or that, or maybe I'm dead.

34:32.820 --> 34:34.822
There was a struggle,
and the gun went off.

34:35.114 --> 34:39.702
Perjury, filing a false police report,
possession with intent to sell.

34:40.369 --> 34:43.539
-Uh-uh, this way, gentlemen.
-Neal, the captain wants to see you.

34:43.623 --> 34:44.624
-Okay, Lieutenant.
-HOWARD: Judas Priest!

34:44.707 --> 34:45.541
Howard?

34:47.376 --> 34:48.377
What's wrong, Howard?

34:49.462 --> 34:52.465
I have just heard that
the Equine Rapid-Development Force

34:52.548 --> 34:55.343
has been felled by the budget acts.

34:55.426 --> 34:56.552
I'm sorry.

34:57.553 --> 35:03.851
My heavens, Raymondo, am I to be mastered
by these blue-pencil-wielding mealy minds?

35:03.935 --> 35:06.813
Must my joy have occupational sanction?

35:06.896 --> 35:11.275
Judas, life is too short,
joy too seldom to come by.

35:12.068 --> 35:14.612
-Apollo stays.
-I don't understand, Howard.

35:14.695 --> 35:16.489
-(sighs) Apollo.
-What is Apollo?

35:16.572 --> 35:18.407
Apollo! Apollo, my horse.

35:19.033 --> 35:22.537
If the city council doesn't want him,
I do, and I'm gonna keep him.

35:22.620 --> 35:24.413
Well, the hell with you, Your Honor.

35:26.666 --> 35:27.500
Where's Furillo?

35:27.583 --> 35:29.794
-Hey, forget it, Marcus.
-I want Furillo.

35:29.877 --> 35:31.379
You're not getting him,
so just lighten up.

35:31.462 --> 35:33.339
He took my job, man. He shuffled me out.

35:33.422 --> 35:36.134
Maybe because you killed that kid. Hey!

35:36.217 --> 35:38.636
-Keep your hands off me!
-No, Marcus! No more temper!

35:38.719 --> 35:40.096
-(grunting)
-Get off of me!

35:40.179 --> 35:41.055
I got him, I got him.

35:41.139 --> 35:42.723
-MARCUS: Get off me, man!
-DAVIS: I got him! I'll take care of him!

35:43.724 --> 35:44.934
You lighten up, Marcus.

35:45.017 --> 35:47.270
You lighten up or your head is busted
and you're gone!

35:48.896 --> 35:49.730
Tom.

35:49.981 --> 35:51.774
Whatever you say, whatever you want.

35:51.858 --> 35:53.609
You just don't get yourself
jammed, understand?

35:54.193 --> 35:55.862
I mean, you know the man took my job?

35:56.445 --> 35:58.739
I just talked to that tom mayor
on the phone, man.

35:59.323 --> 36:00.658
He already took my job.

36:01.659 --> 36:03.202
And you talk about jamming me up.

36:03.286 --> 36:04.453
Yeah, well, I'm sorry about that.

36:07.248 --> 36:08.207
Now, you relax.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.085
-Take it easy.
-I was-- I was defending myself.

36:11.169 --> 36:13.212
Take it easy, all right?

36:24.974 --> 36:25.975
Hey, Furillo!

36:26.058 --> 36:27.518
You satisfied, man, huh?

36:27.602 --> 36:29.437
Is that what you wanted?
What did you tell him, huh?

36:29.520 --> 36:31.189
Did you tell him Peabody's too street?

36:31.272 --> 36:32.273
Hey, Marcus.

36:32.356 --> 36:34.358
-Peabody can't keep control, huh?
-Marcus!

36:34.734 --> 36:37.069
Marcus, listen to me.

36:38.112 --> 36:41.365
You already made two mistakes today.
Now, you can't win this one!

36:41.449 --> 36:43.075
You can't win, man. Not now!

36:44.493 --> 36:47.205
You just move on. You understand that?

36:47.705 --> 36:49.040
Move on!

36:58.799 --> 37:00.134
It's you who don't understand, man.

37:02.178 --> 37:03.304
I was trying to help.

37:09.810 --> 37:11.354
(door slams open)

37:14.732 --> 37:16.525
I understand you made a smart bust.

37:16.609 --> 37:17.568
Yeah, thank you, sir.

37:22.448 --> 37:25.409
Now give me 30 seconds on why
I shouldn't transfer Garibaldi.

37:27.245 --> 37:28.079
I don't know, Captain.

37:29.288 --> 37:31.874
Maybe you should. What's the grounds?

37:31.958 --> 37:34.585
Because he doesn't listen,
because he handles himself like a kid,

37:34.669 --> 37:37.004
and because maybe he gets his partner
caught in the switches.

37:37.088 --> 37:39.799
About that liquor store thing, Captain.
I went back there on my own hook.

37:39.882 --> 37:41.968
Did some calling,
decided the complainant was bad.

37:42.051 --> 37:43.928
By the way, I checked with O'Malley.
And that guy?

37:44.387 --> 37:45.638
He was cool once I laid it out for him.

37:45.721 --> 37:47.848
-Okay, I'll keep him.
-Harry's okay, Captain.

37:47.932 --> 37:51.477
Maybe he gets a little cute sometimes,
you know, but he's got to get taught.

37:51.560 --> 37:53.312
That'll be your job till J.D. gets back.

37:53.396 --> 37:55.690
-I'll try, Captain, you know?
-Good.

37:57.525 --> 38:00.278
Because I like Harry, Neal.
I think he's a bright, concerned guy.

38:00.361 --> 38:02.738
But he rear-ended a citizen,
his insurance is expired,

38:02.822 --> 38:04.824
a whole day's gone by,
and it's probably still expired.

38:04.907 --> 38:06.284
I hear you, Captain.

38:09.161 --> 38:10.955
Ms. Davenport. Looking good.

38:15.126 --> 38:16.711
Here. Put this on.

38:16.794 --> 38:17.878
-What is it?
-Tuxedo.

38:17.962 --> 38:19.797
-Where have you been all day?
-Never mind where I've been.

38:19.880 --> 38:21.465
This is for the Summer Love benefit.

38:21.549 --> 38:24.510
Remember? The needy children
who have to go to summer camp?

38:25.803 --> 38:28.222
I thought the deal was
I'd buy the tickets if we didn't go.

38:28.723 --> 38:30.349
W-well, we decided to go.

38:31.100 --> 38:32.018
We did?

38:32.101 --> 38:34.812
(chuckles) I'm sorry, Frank.

38:34.895 --> 38:38.065
I mean, I know I took the liberty,
but I just felt like dancing.

38:38.649 --> 38:39.483
Do you really mind?

38:39.567 --> 38:40.651
No. It's okay.

38:41.110 --> 38:42.111
Seriously?

38:42.611 --> 38:43.571
No, it's all right,

38:44.071 --> 38:46.365
if we can stop at Murphy's
on the way back and get a burger?

38:46.449 --> 38:48.451
(laughing) You got it.

38:48.534 --> 38:50.536
We can stop at Murphy's
on the way over and get a burger?

38:50.619 --> 38:52.163
-You got that.
-We can stop at Murphy's--

38:52.246 --> 38:53.748
Go on. Go change.

38:55.041 --> 38:55.875
Okay.

38:58.919 --> 39:02.006
Now you look here, sucker!
I've done too much covering in my time.

39:02.089 --> 39:03.507
So if you're gonna make it up here,
you're gonna make it fast.

39:03.591 --> 39:04.842
Harry. Neal.

39:05.718 --> 39:06.802
-Captain.
-Captain.

39:09.764 --> 39:11.182
Ken and Barbie. (chuckles)

39:11.974 --> 39:13.267
You're a funny, dude. You know that?

39:14.018 --> 39:16.145
People like you. I like you.

39:17.146 --> 39:20.649
But you could go either way, Harry,
and everybody up here knows it, man.

39:22.109 --> 39:25.946
(classical music plays)

39:43.756 --> 39:45.841
I've never done anything like that before.

39:45.925 --> 39:46.926
I just took a hike.

39:47.301 --> 39:50.513
I drove to the shore,
and I rented a rowboat.

39:50.596 --> 39:53.140
And I had lunch in this--
In this little outdoor cafe.

39:53.224 --> 39:54.475
It was wonderful, Frank.

39:55.476 --> 39:58.312
I didn't think about courtrooms
or squad rooms all day.

39:59.313 --> 40:00.481
Good for you, Joyce.

40:00.564 --> 40:02.483
(laughing) Thank you, Irwin.

40:02.566 --> 40:03.401
Irwin.

40:03.734 --> 40:06.487
(sighs) We could all take a lesson, Frank.

40:07.238 --> 40:08.948
Or we could all take a drink. (chuckles)

40:09.907 --> 40:11.450
Or we could all take a flying--

40:11.534 --> 40:14.954
(beeping)

40:15.246 --> 40:16.288
FRANK: No. It's mine.

40:16.664 --> 40:18.082
-Oh.
-Back in a minute.

40:18.457 --> 40:19.458
-ALAN: Frank.
-Hello.

40:20.960 --> 40:21.794
Irwin.

40:22.711 --> 40:23.712
Joycie.

40:25.631 --> 40:27.675
One hour, 46 minutes to D-day.

40:28.926 --> 40:33.055
We're working what I'm tentatively
calling, "operation vid scam."

40:33.556 --> 40:35.307
A little discretion, Alan.

40:35.933 --> 40:37.685
We're all officers
of the court here, Irwin.

40:37.768 --> 40:38.602
Lighten up.

40:40.729 --> 40:41.981
I'm wearing a wire.

40:42.648 --> 40:45.234
-IRWIN: You're also wearing a wig.
-ALAN: Oh, they'll be expecting this.

40:45.317 --> 40:48.237
They'll think I'm a judge taking a bribe.
They'll think I'm scared.

40:48.320 --> 40:50.614
They'll think I think
I better be incognito.

40:51.115 --> 40:51.949
Ergo...

40:53.409 --> 40:54.243
rug-o.

40:55.953 --> 40:56.954
Good thinking, Alan.

40:57.329 --> 40:58.330
ALAN: You ought to try it, Bernstein.

40:58.706 --> 41:01.792
It gives us baldies a whole other
dimension of sexuality.

41:04.587 --> 41:05.504
It's also warm.

41:07.256 --> 41:09.175
-I have to go.
-Why?

41:09.508 --> 41:12.595
I have a massacre on my hands.
I'm really sorry. Do you want to stay?

41:14.472 --> 41:15.473
Yes.

41:16.098 --> 41:17.433
I'll see her to a cab, Frank.

41:17.725 --> 41:18.559
Go get 'em, Frank.

41:19.977 --> 41:20.811
It's me.

41:22.188 --> 41:23.606
"Give 'em hell" Wachtel.

41:26.275 --> 41:28.486
Irwin. Judge Wachtel.

41:28.569 --> 41:30.279
Don't wait up for me. I'm gonna be late.

41:30.779 --> 41:32.323
(Alan sighs)

41:32.406 --> 41:35.951
Shootouts, gang wars,

41:36.368 --> 41:37.620
covert operations...

41:40.247 --> 41:41.290
Oh, God, I love it.

41:45.544 --> 41:48.047
Frank ever tell you about the time
I wore a mic in my brassiere?

41:48.130 --> 41:49.507
Do you know what a steamer is?

41:51.133 --> 41:51.967
No.

41:52.801 --> 41:54.303
I get carried away when I bet.

41:54.386 --> 41:58.015
If I start to lose, I get steamed.
I start to build my bets up.

41:58.641 --> 42:01.352
Mr. Franklin, does this man
look like a head doctor?

42:01.435 --> 42:02.686
I'm just saying, okay?

42:03.395 --> 42:06.565
So the book, he lets me play, man.
He lets me go to $1,000 a game.

42:07.358 --> 42:10.778
Does this man look like
your bookmaker, Mr. Franklin?

42:12.071 --> 42:14.156
I need 3,000, and I can pay it back,

42:14.240 --> 42:16.325
I can pay it back to you
in about six weeks.

42:17.409 --> 42:19.036
That'll happen when it happens.

42:19.119 --> 42:22.831
The only thing this man has got to know
that every Monday until it's paid up,

42:22.915 --> 42:27.002
you're here with an envelope
for either myself or Joey Desoto.

42:27.086 --> 42:29.505
Hey, hey.
What time you want me here Monday?

42:30.005 --> 42:31.382
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

42:37.513 --> 42:38.722
Nature calls.

42:39.557 --> 42:41.559
Has it occurred to you
you're frisking a judge?

42:41.642 --> 42:43.435
I got my instructions, Your Honor.

42:43.519 --> 42:44.979
-Hey.
-Hey, Mike.

42:45.062 --> 42:49.275
What kind of Mickey Mouse is this, huh?
Anybody could walk in here.

42:49.358 --> 42:50.859
Mr. Franco says search him.

42:50.943 --> 42:52.444
What are you gonna do,
search him or kiss him?

42:52.528 --> 42:54.405
Keep the doorjamb. Go on. Go on!

42:56.282 --> 42:58.534
I'm warning you. I'm ticklish.

42:58.617 --> 42:59.868
(grumbles)

42:59.952 --> 43:03.122
(sirens wailing)

43:03.205 --> 43:06.792
(indistinct conversations)

43:17.595 --> 43:20.389
Two dead, five wounded.
One critically, a bystander.

43:20.472 --> 43:21.432
Who started it?

43:21.682 --> 43:25.853
They came in to pay back the Blood,
about 20 Diablos in four cars.

43:26.145 --> 43:28.439
The Blood were expecting it
and ambushed them here.

43:29.148 --> 43:32.026
First gunfire,
then hand-to-hand in the street.

43:32.610 --> 43:34.111
Diablos got messed up pretty badly.

43:34.194 --> 43:37.573
Hey, we got him, man!
We killed him! They dragged him away!

43:38.532 --> 43:40.534
Heard sirens, Blood took off.

43:40.618 --> 43:42.703
-Where's Jesus?
-Nobody knows.

43:43.037 --> 43:44.913
They say he wasn't any part of it.

43:45.456 --> 43:48.917
Here's a piece of news.
Marcus Peabody was with the Blood.

43:49.960 --> 43:51.128
Three witnesses saw him.

43:52.296 --> 43:53.547
All right, APB on Peabody.

43:53.631 --> 43:55.716
Everybody on the night shift
out on the street.

43:58.052 --> 44:00.846
I'm gonna kill him, man.
The man's dead meat!

44:00.929 --> 44:01.847
Get him out of here!

44:10.356 --> 44:11.190
Hi.

44:13.567 --> 44:14.401
Hi.

44:15.235 --> 44:16.654
It's quarter to 2:00.

44:21.241 --> 44:23.035
No one in the place. Just me and you.

44:23.118 --> 44:23.952
Joyce.

44:25.037 --> 44:26.080
Don't "Joyce" me.

44:26.288 --> 44:27.122
You left.

44:28.874 --> 44:30.668
After you left, I had a wonderful time.

44:30.751 --> 44:32.461
Great. Rub my nose in it.

44:32.836 --> 44:34.463
I'm not rubbing your nose in anything.

44:38.175 --> 44:39.301
But after you left,

44:40.844 --> 44:42.096
I had a wonderful time.

44:44.181 --> 44:46.183
I laughed, I danced,

44:46.266 --> 44:47.267
I felt good.

44:48.811 --> 44:50.437
You couldn't do that before I left?

44:50.521 --> 44:51.897
All I know is...

44:53.774 --> 44:56.360
from the moment I walked away
from work this morning...

44:59.321 --> 45:00.280
to right now...

45:02.491 --> 45:05.828
every moment I've had alone,
I've been happy.

45:07.913 --> 45:10.541
Sounds as if you don't mean alone.
You mean without me.

45:10.958 --> 45:12.710
Please, don't make me the heavy, Frank.

45:13.919 --> 45:14.920
I'm not the heavy.

45:16.630 --> 45:17.464
But, yes...

45:19.091 --> 45:20.551
I love you, Pizza Man.

45:21.385 --> 45:23.762
I just need some time by myself.

45:24.596 --> 45:26.765
What exactly are you talking about?

45:26.849 --> 45:28.267
JOYCE: I'm talking about our lives.

45:28.350 --> 45:29.852
I'm talking about this...

45:30.561 --> 45:32.396
day-in and day-out mayhem.

45:33.439 --> 45:35.399
This world that's got no upside...

45:37.234 --> 45:38.902
as far as I can see anyway, and...

45:40.404 --> 45:43.323
that we work in, we bring home.

45:43.866 --> 45:45.868
You mean our jobs or our life together?

45:46.326 --> 45:48.454
Don't you see how
intertwined they've gotten?

45:49.663 --> 45:51.331
I've known you five years, Frank.

45:51.915 --> 45:55.002
We haven't taken more than
a long weekend's vacation.

45:57.171 --> 45:58.255
Look at tonight.

45:58.672 --> 46:01.550
Joyce, they're running wild.
They're killing each other.

46:01.633 --> 46:05.554
What am I supposed to do, say,
"Excuse me, I have a dress ball to go to?"

46:05.763 --> 46:07.723
I'm not saying that you
shouldn't have gone.

46:07.806 --> 46:09.558
I understand your priorities.

46:11.018 --> 46:13.687
It's just that
I-I can't take it right now.

46:14.062 --> 46:15.105
I need a break.

46:16.148 --> 46:17.357
If we took a vacation?

46:17.983 --> 46:18.942
(chuckles)

46:21.820 --> 46:24.364
You know h-- (sniffles)

46:24.448 --> 46:28.494
You know how many times
we've talked about it and never taken it?

46:32.372 --> 46:33.457
What do you really want?

46:36.043 --> 46:38.086
(sniffles)
(sighs)

46:40.339 --> 46:42.966
I want you not to hate me for saying this.

46:45.385 --> 46:47.471
I need a couple of weeks off.

46:48.055 --> 46:48.889
Minimum.

46:49.431 --> 46:52.476
I need to be able to come home to me.

46:53.936 --> 46:54.853
And only me.

46:59.608 --> 47:01.527
I need for us to be separate.

47:04.321 --> 47:05.447
Like the old days.

47:13.664 --> 47:15.541
Then I guess that's what we'll have to do.

47:18.585 --> 47:21.004
I feel horrible about this, Frank,
but I can't.

47:23.882 --> 47:25.676
I have to know what I'm really feeling.

47:29.763 --> 47:31.098
I think we both do.

48:15.434 --> 48:16.810
(crying)

48:23.984 --> 48:26.987
(closing theme playing)
