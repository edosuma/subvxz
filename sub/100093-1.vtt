(CHUCKLES): I'm just gonna take
a wild stab at this,

26:53.195 --> 26:55.448
but was the guy's name
Blackwood, by any chance?

26:55.489 --> 26:56.741
It's my grandfather.

26:56.782 --> 26:59.160
- Yeah.
- Look, working this land

26:59.201 --> 27:02.538
is like, um...
being in a relationship.

27:02.580 --> 27:05.750
There's give and take,
and there's trust.

27:05.791 --> 27:08.794
And there's a shitload
of betrayal.

- Gene's just waking up to that.
- Well, till then,

27:13.716 --> 27:15.926
how does the water board
figure into all this?

27:15.968 --> 27:17.219
The water board is there

27:17.261 --> 27:19.430
to insure the quality
of the water

27:19.472 --> 27:22.016
and allocate that water
for generations to come.

27:22.058 --> 27:23.726
Yeah, I-I understand that part,

the distribution of water.
