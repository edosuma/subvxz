TARA NARRATING: Previously
on "Dance Academy."

00:03.759 --> 00:05.799
-This is my god daughter,
Grace.

00:05.839 --> 00:08.039
-I've been under house arrest
for the last month.

00:08.080 --> 00:09.480
-What did you do?

00:09.519 --> 00:11.640
-My dad's getting remarried, and
I upset the step-mothers.

00:11.679 --> 00:12.640
ABIGAIL (OFFSCREEN):
I miss Kat, and I

00:12.679 --> 00:13.919
think she misses me.

00:13.960 --> 00:17.480
So now, things can go back
to the way they were.

00:17.519 --> 00:20.480
-You got me out of dance
history for this?

00:20.519 --> 00:22.120
I'm allergic to musicals.

00:22.160 --> 00:23.399
-Finn.

00:23.440 --> 00:27.320
-(SINGING) I see what lies
in the eye of the storm.

00:27.359 --> 00:29.160
Any imbecile can sing.

00:29.199 --> 00:30.519
-Not like that.

00:30.559 --> 00:34.439
[theme music]

00:38.240 --> 00:41.039
THEME SONG: Whoa.

00:41.079 --> 00:42.479
Whoa.

00:42.520 --> 00:44.840
Whoa, oh, oh.

00:44.880 --> 00:47.840
Turn around.

00:47.880 --> 00:51.399
Close your eyes.

00:51.439 --> 00:56.399
Take a leap of faith, and
lead the way tonight.

00:59.840 --> 01:01.799
This is my chance.

01:01.840 --> 01:07.319
This is my chance, my chance
to feel alive.

01:07.359 --> 01:10.680
Whoa, oh, oh.

01:10.719 --> 01:12.680
Whoa, oh, oh.

01:18.200 --> 01:20.120
TARA NARRATING: When you're a
dancer, you spend a whole lot

01:20.159 --> 01:21.799
of time fighting nature.

01:21.840 --> 01:24.159
-Relax, Abigail.

01:24.200 --> 01:27.239
Grim determination is not
a good look on cupid.

01:27.280 --> 01:33.480
TARA NARRATING: Trying to
be, which means there's

01:33.519 --> 01:34.599
this part of you--

01:34.640 --> 01:36.640
-Nice, Tara, beautiful lines.

01:36.680 --> 01:39.560
TARA NARRATING: --this
self-critical part that, no

01:39.599 --> 01:43.799
matter what, always thinks
you can do better.

01:46.840 --> 01:50.680
Well, at least most of
us are like that.

01:50.719 --> 01:52.640
-Grace.

01:52.680 --> 01:54.439
TARA NARRATING: There's also the
one in a billion who don't

01:54.480 --> 01:55.560
need to try.

01:55.599 --> 01:58.159
The naturals--

01:58.200 --> 02:00.400
very hard not to hate them.

02:00.439 --> 02:01.560
-All right, guys, game over.

02:01.599 --> 02:04.599
I'll see you back in the
trenches tomorrow.

02:04.640 --> 02:07.799
-Zack, your positive feedback
is inspirational.

02:15.840 --> 02:18.719
-Abigail.

02:18.759 --> 02:20.360
Finn.

02:20.400 --> 02:22.439
You made cutting comments
at my auditions.

02:22.479 --> 02:26.479
I won you round with my
undeniable charm.

02:26.520 --> 02:27.840
-I remember.

02:27.879 --> 02:30.319
But I'd describe your
charm as deniable.

02:30.360 --> 02:34.199
-Well, look, my low budget but
nevertheless excellent musical

02:34.240 --> 02:38.039
is in need of a new
leading lady.

02:38.080 --> 02:39.479
-So?

02:39.520 --> 02:40.960
I don't sing.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.719
-No, our mutual friend, Ethan,
has sent me countless emails

02:42.759 --> 02:43.560
to the opposite.

02:43.599 --> 02:44.800
-I didn't say I couldn't sing.

02:44.840 --> 02:46.360
I said I don't.

02:46.400 --> 02:47.599
-Read it.

02:51.240 --> 02:52.560
KAT (OFFSCREEN): A headache.

02:52.599 --> 02:54.120
-No.

02:54.159 --> 02:55.039
-Backache?

02:55.080 --> 02:56.360
-Uh-huh.

02:56.400 --> 02:58.800
-And I'm developing a severe
case of invisibility.

02:58.840 --> 02:59.759
-Pardon?

02:59.800 --> 03:01.599
-Sorry.

03:01.639 --> 03:02.599
-Sorry, I just--

03:02.639 --> 03:03.719
I don't what's wrong with me.

03:03.759 --> 03:04.560
Dancing's fine.

03:04.599 --> 03:05.680
My back is fine.

03:05.719 --> 03:07.400
Even this sandwich is fine.

03:07.439 --> 03:09.439
Haven't you checked
your star sign?

03:09.479 --> 03:11.479
Cosmic Carla doesn't lie.

03:11.520 --> 03:12.240
Taurus?

03:12.280 --> 03:14.400
-Oh, no, she's a Libra.

03:14.439 --> 03:18.199
-Ugh, star signs only work if
you're in love or got a crush.

03:18.240 --> 03:20.240
-Ah, Mercury's in retrograde.

03:20.280 --> 03:21.840
It's disrupting your
librum balance.

03:21.879 --> 03:23.240
-Of course.

03:23.280 --> 03:25.120
I feel scratchy and
unfulfilled.

03:25.159 --> 03:26.199
That's what's missing.

03:26.240 --> 03:27.280
-A stable Mercury.

03:27.319 --> 03:29.680
-A crush.

03:29.719 --> 03:32.800
-Oh, no, T. Don't you think
a hobby would be safer?

03:32.840 --> 03:35.159
I've hear quilting is
making a comeback.

03:35.199 --> 03:36.319
-A crush.

03:40.199 --> 03:41.240
-What about Marcus?

03:41.280 --> 03:43.240
He asked to borrow
my pen that time.

03:43.280 --> 03:45.680
-We tagged your leotard.

03:45.719 --> 03:48.639
-Shane's not too bad if you
look him from the left.

03:48.680 --> 03:51.319
-He exfoliates his face
with a toothbrush.

03:51.360 --> 03:57.159
-Mouth breather, gay,
clammy, mute.

03:57.199 --> 03:59.360
-Grace, you find the
good in everyone.

03:59.400 --> 04:01.840
-Boys are a waste of time.

04:01.879 --> 04:04.479
-All right, less talk, people.

04:04.520 --> 04:07.199
Next group, please.

04:07.240 --> 04:10.039
Five, six, seven, eight.

04:10.080 --> 04:11.240
-Silent Luke isn't mute.

04:11.280 --> 04:14.319
He just chooses his
words carefully.

04:14.360 --> 04:17.600
-Yeah, he's an untapped well
of profound thoughts.

04:17.639 --> 04:18.800
Watch.

04:21.079 --> 04:24.759
Hey, Silent Luke.

04:24.800 --> 04:28.240
I was thinking, we've been
classmates for a year, and I

04:28.279 --> 04:29.720
don't know a single
thing about you.

04:32.839 --> 04:35.199
Is that lavender?

04:35.240 --> 04:37.480
Interesting choice--

04:37.519 --> 04:39.720
not that I'm surprised.

04:39.759 --> 04:42.120
You wear tights here
like no one else.

04:42.160 --> 04:43.759
-Grace, are you done?

04:43.800 --> 04:45.600
Because if you're not interested
in my class, why

04:45.639 --> 04:46.800
don't you just leave?

04:51.279 --> 04:53.480
Guys, that was wrestling,
not partnering.

04:57.519 --> 04:59.279
Five, six, seven, eight.

05:06.240 --> 05:10.079
-Grace, look.

05:10.120 --> 05:11.800
-Oh my goodness,
it's a monkey.

05:11.839 --> 05:14.279
-Oh, your niece is
just adorable.

05:14.319 --> 05:17.680
-She'd want to be with
a name like Angel.

05:17.720 --> 05:20.160
I got kicked out of class.

05:20.199 --> 05:21.480
All this domestic change--

05:21.519 --> 05:23.600
I must be acting out.

05:23.639 --> 05:24.800
-Have you spoken
to your father?

05:28.120 --> 05:29.160
-I got that group email.

05:29.199 --> 05:31.279
-Oh, he really should--

05:31.319 --> 05:32.480
-What?

05:34.279 --> 05:37.800
We see you have an opinion.

05:37.839 --> 05:39.360
-I think your father
is a brilliant man.

05:39.399 --> 05:41.160
I also think he doesn't give
you enough of his time.

05:41.199 --> 05:43.600
-You don't know him.

05:43.639 --> 05:46.120
My dad is the only person
who has ever been

05:46.160 --> 05:48.240
there for me, ever.

05:48.279 --> 05:49.600
Who are you?

05:49.639 --> 05:52.560
Some lonely old woman who thinks
she knows me because a

05:52.600 --> 05:54.360
million years ago you were
friends with my mom.

05:54.399 --> 05:56.439
-Grace.

05:56.480 --> 05:57.639
Grace.

06:14.839 --> 06:16.199
-When it's that quick, it--

06:16.240 --> 06:18.160
[sigh]

06:18.199 --> 06:20.639
it really needs to be
technically perfect.

06:20.680 --> 06:22.639
-I know.

06:22.680 --> 06:23.839
-And alive.

06:38.319 --> 06:42.160
-Do I need to take out
a restraining order?

06:42.199 --> 06:44.079
-Oh, we lost the theater
for our rehearsals.

06:44.120 --> 06:46.319
I paid a booking fee, but
I don't mind sharing.

06:46.360 --> 06:47.120
-I do.

06:47.160 --> 06:48.199
-You can come on in, Mistii.

06:51.600 --> 06:52.759
I recast.

06:55.240 --> 06:56.639
-Mistii--

06:56.680 --> 06:57.759
cute name.

06:57.800 --> 06:58.519
-Thanks.

06:58.560 --> 07:00.199
I spell it with two i's.

07:07.680 --> 07:09.639
GRACE (OFFSCREEN): Do we
need to talk, Zack?

07:09.680 --> 07:11.160
Are we not friends anymore?

07:14.399 --> 07:17.199
You don't need to bother
reporting me to Miss Raine.

07:17.240 --> 07:18.720
I did it myself.

07:18.759 --> 07:20.720
-Mmm.

07:20.759 --> 07:22.319
[car starts]

07:27.279 --> 07:28.639
[revs engine]

07:31.680 --> 07:33.319
-Grace, you might want
to get off the car

07:33.360 --> 07:34.480
before I drive away.

07:51.240 --> 07:53.199
[sigh]

07:53.240 --> 07:58.319
-A fundamental part of Mia,
your character, is your

07:58.360 --> 08:02.120
insecurity Like, she feels ugly
except when she dances.

08:02.160 --> 08:03.800
-But she's pretty, right?

08:03.839 --> 08:05.240
I'm pretty.

08:05.279 --> 08:06.319
-You're gorgeous.

08:06.360 --> 08:10.560
But Mia doesn't realize it.

08:10.600 --> 08:13.319
-I get it.

08:13.360 --> 08:14.639
-There's nothing to get.

08:14.680 --> 08:15.720
Not everyone looks
in the mirror and

08:15.759 --> 08:17.079
likes what they see.

08:17.120 --> 08:18.800
-Maybe we should just move on.

08:18.839 --> 08:20.720
Um-- oh, the big show stopper.

08:20.759 --> 08:23.680
All right, now Ethan sent
this from Barcelona.

08:27.879 --> 08:34.159
-Is that, like, a neck move,
or is it more a one, two--

08:34.200 --> 08:36.480
sort of a subtle.

08:36.519 --> 08:38.799
-Mmm, no.

08:38.840 --> 08:42.440
-Let me see.

08:42.480 --> 08:43.120
Notation--

08:43.159 --> 08:46.480
Ethan's so old school.

08:46.519 --> 08:49.480
He just means this.

08:49.519 --> 08:53.279
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven,

08:53.320 --> 08:55.480
eight, drag and up.

08:55.519 --> 08:56.639
-I can do that.

09:01.840 --> 09:03.399
-You have That's on your left.

09:07.200 --> 09:08.360
Your other left.

09:12.639 --> 09:13.799
-Oh, that's my left.

09:20.399 --> 09:21.600
TARA (OFFSCREEN): Am I single?

09:21.639 --> 09:22.600
[laughter]

09:22.639 --> 09:23.799
-Eternally.

09:23.840 --> 09:24.879
-You'd be surprised.

09:24.919 --> 09:27.440
Online dating has a
lot to answer for.

09:27.480 --> 09:28.360
-OK.

09:28.399 --> 09:30.399
Am I hot?

09:30.440 --> 09:34.240
-Uh, maybe if you took off that
formal jacket, put on

09:34.279 --> 09:36.759
something floaty, let your hair
down in the middle of

09:36.799 --> 09:37.360
class.

09:37.399 --> 09:37.799
-I'm Miss Raine.

09:37.840 --> 09:41.399
[laughter]

09:41.440 --> 09:43.159
-It's a spinster omen.

09:43.200 --> 09:44.440
Like, what is wrong with me?

09:44.480 --> 09:45.600
I--

09:45.639 --> 09:46.679
I used to turn around
and, crush central.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.559
Now-- nothing.

09:48.600 --> 09:50.559
There are officially no

09:50.600 --> 09:52.320
crush-worth guys at the academy.

09:52.360 --> 09:53.639
-Ben's hot.

09:53.679 --> 09:54.360
-Ben?

09:54.399 --> 09:55.519
-Nice.

09:55.559 --> 09:56.360
-Exactly--

09:56.399 --> 09:57.600
you're too nice.

09:57.639 --> 10:00.799
You're all goofy and harmless.

10:00.840 --> 10:03.600
-Harmless.

10:03.639 --> 10:04.600
-Whoa--

10:04.639 --> 10:05.759
ah.

10:13.799 --> 10:16.279
-Um, must be my turn.

10:16.320 --> 10:19.480
Do I have insured body parts?

10:19.519 --> 10:22.600
-Turn, step, kick.

10:22.639 --> 10:25.039
Turn, shoulder, shoulder and--

10:25.080 --> 10:26.000
-Good.

10:26.039 --> 10:27.559
-Yes, finally.

10:27.600 --> 10:28.720
-15 seconds down.

10:28.759 --> 10:30.600
89 minutes and 45
seconds to go.

10:30.639 --> 10:32.039
-Oh my god.

10:32.080 --> 10:34.240
I bet you have to sing and
dance, like, at the same time.

10:34.279 --> 10:35.360
[laughter]

10:35.399 --> 10:36.320
-[sigh]

10:36.360 --> 10:37.120
Thank you.

10:37.159 --> 10:38.279
-Thank you.

10:45.120 --> 10:46.519
Rigorous casting process?

10:46.559 --> 10:49.559
-Oh, I'm secretly
very shallow.

10:49.600 --> 10:52.200
She tries hard.

10:52.240 --> 10:55.360
And my first choice
turned me down.

10:55.399 --> 10:57.759
But she seems to respond
to your approach.

10:57.799 --> 10:59.759
The least you could do
is help me train her.

10:59.799 --> 11:04.000
-No, the least I can do
is absolutely nothing.

11:04.039 --> 11:05.559
-I need you.

11:05.600 --> 11:08.240
Mistii needs you.

11:08.279 --> 11:09.440
-Ballet needs me.

11:23.200 --> 11:24.600
-Oh, captain, my captain.

11:24.639 --> 11:25.519
-I've already had breakfast.

11:25.559 --> 11:28.679
Thanks, Grace.

11:28.720 --> 11:30.039
Who wants to go first?

11:32.120 --> 11:35.200
Abigail, here we go.

11:35.240 --> 11:38.080
-Wow, I've never noticed before
that your knees are

11:38.120 --> 11:39.720
perfectly symmetrical.

11:39.759 --> 11:42.279
-Um, thanks.

11:42.320 --> 11:44.440
-You were probably
born like that.

11:44.480 --> 11:46.679
When were you born,
by the way?

11:46.720 --> 11:48.039
-Um.

11:58.120 --> 12:00.679
-Abigail, we talked
about this.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.720
If you keep smashing your head
up against the wall, the wall

12:03.759 --> 12:05.799
is going to win.

12:05.840 --> 12:08.559
-OK, can I just try it one
more time, please?

12:08.600 --> 12:11.080
-One more time.

12:11.120 --> 12:13.159
-He's an Aries, of course.

12:13.200 --> 12:18.039
I have a special connection
with first signs.

12:18.080 --> 12:19.759
97% compatible.

12:19.799 --> 12:22.360
-Well, if Love Signs
R Us says so.

12:22.399 --> 12:24.440
-Why am I hearing talking?

12:24.480 --> 12:25.759
You guys should be
keeping warm.

-Great job, Abs.

13:05.120 --> 13:06.279
You nearly got it.

13:08.799 --> 13:13.279
-Abigail, that solo makes you
look heavy and earthbound,

13:13.320 --> 13:14.440
which you're not.

13:14.480 --> 13:16.039
You're clinging to something
that shows up

13:16.080 --> 13:17.200
what you can't do.

13:17.240 --> 13:19.360
I don't know how much
more clear I can be.

13:23.519 --> 13:27.360
I'll see you after class.

13:27.399 --> 13:29.360
-But I was only keeping
warm like you said.

13:29.399 --> 13:31.200
-You knew what you were doing
to Abigail, and it was

13:31.240 --> 13:32.320
destructive.

13:32.360 --> 13:34.759
-I out dance everyone,
and you ignore me.

13:34.799 --> 13:36.559
What kind of teacher are you?

13:36.600 --> 13:39.600
-The others are trying, and you
rub their nose in how easy

13:39.639 --> 13:40.759
it is for you.

13:40.799 --> 13:42.279
How little do you care?

13:42.320 --> 13:43.360
You're right.

13:43.399 --> 13:45.240
You have enormous
natural ability.

13:45.279 --> 13:48.559
But Grace, these games you
play, I don't find them

13:48.600 --> 13:49.759

You're probably off fighting

14:10.120 --> 14:11.679
You'd probably be really
good at that.

Nothing to report.

14:18.279 --> 14:20.039

the Nationals.

14:20.080 --> 14:21.279
OK, see ya.

14:39.559 --> 14:42.480
-Ben.

14:42.519 --> 14:44.759
The way we keep, uh, running
into each other,

14:44.799 --> 14:46.559
we must be in sync.

14:46.600 --> 14:48.759
-Or we were just in class
together, and now

14:48.799 --> 14:49.759
it's time to eat.

14:49.799 --> 14:50.360
Huh.

14:50.399 --> 14:52.279
-Ha ha.

14:52.320 --> 14:53.480
Cool toothpick.

14:56.240 --> 14:59.440
-You do know that kiss
wasn't a kiss.

14:59.480 --> 15:00.799
It was a point, just a point.

15:00.840 --> 15:01.799
That's it.

15:01.840 --> 15:03.159
-Absolutely.

15:06.759 --> 15:10.440
So what are you doing
this afternoon?

15:10.480 --> 15:12.799
Not as a date, it's
just that Kat--

15:12.840 --> 15:14.159
Kat--

15:14.200 --> 15:15.200
Kat and Christian, they asked
me to go out with them.

15:15.240 --> 15:16.759
And-- and I don't want
to go on my own,

15:16.799 --> 15:18.440
and I feel kind of--

15:18.480 --> 15:19.440
-Awkward?

15:19.480 --> 15:20.440
-Yeah, exactly.

15:20.480 --> 15:23.679
So you'd be helping
me out big time.

15:23.720 --> 15:24.360
-Yeah, all right.

15:24.399 --> 15:25.639
Sure.

15:25.679 --> 15:28.080
-Amazeballs.

15:28.120 --> 15:30.360
Later, then.

15:30.399 --> 15:32.240
Heh.

15:32.279 --> 15:34.159
-Ugh.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.360
-Kat, please tell me you
guys don't have plans.

15:41.600 --> 15:42.159
-And I'll--

15:42.200 --> 15:43.320
I'll tell you.

15:43.360 --> 15:44.440
Like if you do too much,
I'll just tell you.

15:44.480 --> 15:46.200
And you kind of can embody
that and do a

15:46.240 --> 15:47.480
kind of fine work.

15:47.519 --> 15:51.000
Abigail, we were just
workshopping some costume

15:51.039 --> 15:54.360
ideas and running some lines.

15:54.399 --> 15:56.399
-I'm only helping with
the dancing.

15:56.440 --> 15:58.240
Be eternally grateful.

15:58.279 --> 15:59.440
-Oh.

16:05.279 --> 16:08.799
-Wow, you, like, read
the whole script.

16:08.840 --> 16:10.360
-Can we start?

16:10.399 --> 16:11.559
-Mmm-hmm.

16:25.080 --> 16:26.360
-It was a million years ago.

16:33.639 --> 16:37.120
Your mother and I.

16:37.159 --> 16:38.200
-You were goths?

16:38.240 --> 16:41.159
-Uh, we were new romantics,
thank you.

16:41.200 --> 16:42.519
[laughs]

16:42.559 --> 16:46.159
That was taken at an Adam
and the Ants concert.

16:46.200 --> 16:47.759
There was no one
like your mom.

16:47.799 --> 16:50.120
I can't tell you some of the
things she'd get me to do.

16:53.320 --> 16:55.399
-Dad said she was depressed.

16:55.440 --> 16:57.159
I remember her lying in bed.

16:57.200 --> 17:00.159
-Yeah, that came later.

17:00.200 --> 17:02.360
And I blamed your father for
taking her away, and I

17:02.399 --> 17:03.679
shouldn't have.

17:03.720 --> 17:07.559
I thought she was better off
dancing in the company.

17:07.598 --> 17:12.039
But thinking back, she always
put on this big act, but you

17:12.079 --> 17:13.358
never knew what was
going on inside.

17:17.640 --> 17:21.759
-Maybe she thought nobody
would be interested.

17:21.799 --> 17:24.279
-She might have felt less lonely
if she'd given people

17:24.319 --> 17:25.519
the chance to decide.

17:38.319 --> 17:41.240
-Zack.

17:41.279 --> 17:43.599
You don't know me.

17:43.640 --> 17:47.279
Dancing, I find it easy,
and I get bored.

17:47.319 --> 17:49.039
-Well then, you should probably
do something else.

17:49.079 --> 17:54.480
-It's the only thing I'm good
at, and I do care about it.

17:54.519 --> 17:55.720
-Really?

17:55.759 --> 17:58.119
-I think so.

17:58.160 --> 18:02.599
-Grace, I have no idea what's
real and what's fake with you.

18:02.640 --> 18:05.599
-A lot of the time,
neither do I.

18:05.640 --> 18:09.759
-All right, then maybe you need
to be challenged more.

18:09.799 --> 18:11.279
You want my attention?

18:11.319 --> 18:15.079
Then don't waste it.

18:55.039 --> 18:57.240
-OK, but if you were going to
fall for him, don't you think

18:57.279 --> 18:58.480
it would have happened already?

I'm back.

need a project.

-Um, we are sitting down.

-I made sandwiches.

the-- about the kiss, and it

is.

kissing skills.

girlfriend, right here, right

now, a full-on relationship,
you'd say yes?

nice, simple crush.

20:02.559 --> 20:05.240
Is it that hard to
just be a crush?

No, I--
