JUDY: Alanis,

00:36.019 --> 00:37.703
good morning.
How are you?

00:37.854 --> 00:40.021
I'm good. Just finished
an appointment with my dentist.

00:40.041 --> 00:42.783
I'm my dentist's therapist.
It's a long story.

00:42.877 --> 00:44.209
Well, I'm glad
you're here tonight

00:44.361 --> 00:46.528
because I'm throwing
one of my world-famous parties,

00:46.622 --> 00:48.530
and you know how those get.
(chuckles)

00:48.624 --> 00:52.109
The time on the invitation says
"until question mark,"

00:52.127 --> 00:53.868
uh, for a reason.

00:53.962 --> 00:55.537
(both howl)

00:55.631 --> 00:57.205
Your parties really are
something else.

00:57.299 --> 00:59.800
Like your Margot Martindale
appreciation party

00:59.894 --> 01:01.376
where you taught your guests
how to craft

01:01.395 --> 01:03.804
artisanal virgin
Margot Martin-tinis.

01:03.956 --> 01:06.456
And don't forget
my truffle pigs party.

01:06.550 --> 01:09.551
It was not easy burying 400
fake truffles in my backyard,

01:09.570 --> 01:10.811
but it was worth it to see

01:10.963 --> 01:12.813
everyone's painted pink faces
light up

01:12.965 --> 01:13.922
when they found them.

01:13.924 --> 01:15.816
And this evening
will mark the zenith

01:15.910 --> 01:17.242
of an epic
party-throwing career,

01:17.394 --> 01:21.822
for tonight I throw a...
(gasps) murder mystery party.

01:21.957 --> 01:24.232
-(howls)
-You said it.

01:24.326 --> 01:26.310
Okay, well, I got to go put
some more feathers in my cap,

01:26.328 --> 01:28.995
literally, because I made
a period-accurate hat

01:29.148 --> 01:31.315
that's really gonna take tonight
to the next level.

01:31.408 --> 01:34.409
Yup. Nothing gets a party
started like an old hat.

01:34.428 --> 01:36.261
(both howl)

01:37.431 --> 01:38.764
Okay, so you're
covering appetizers,

01:38.915 --> 01:40.081
and for the main dish

01:40.101 --> 01:42.750
I'm ordering a pizza
from DeGigantico's.

01:42.770 --> 01:44.269
Everyone loves it because...

01:44.421 --> 01:46.663
BOTH:
It's-a too-a big-a!

01:46.756 --> 01:48.256
(ding)

01:48.275 --> 01:49.090
What?

01:49.184 --> 01:51.276
Oh, nothing, it's just Stacie B.

01:51.428 --> 01:57.007
Ah, my old frenemy who is now
too popular for yours Jude-ly.

01:57.100 --> 01:59.042
(lofty accent):
What doth she text?

01:59.102 --> 02:01.453
Ugh, it's a beer glass emoji
and a puking face,

02:01.680 --> 02:04.197
aka an invite
for her dumb party tonight.

02:04.350 --> 02:06.850
But I'm having a party tonight.

02:06.943 --> 02:08.627
Wait, does
Stacie B's invite mean

02:08.854 --> 02:10.354
that she's going
to have alcohol?

02:10.372 --> 02:12.372
-And puking?
-I wouldn't worry.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.633
Her last party was,
like, whatever.

02:14.860 --> 02:16.284
You went to her last party?

02:16.303 --> 02:18.044
Yeah, when you and your dad
went ice climbing.

02:18.197 --> 02:19.120
It wasn't even fun.

02:19.214 --> 02:20.305
Stacie B wouldn't let anyone use

02:20.457 --> 02:21.715
the decorative towels
in the bathroom,

02:21.809 --> 02:24.885
so we were all just
walking around with wet hands.

02:25.037 --> 02:26.370
Cool.

02:26.388 --> 02:27.737
Oh, what's wrong? Did you fart?

02:27.739 --> 02:28.647
Should I create a distraction?

02:28.798 --> 02:30.056
No, it's just,

02:30.209 --> 02:32.209
is it weird you didn't
tell me that you went?

02:32.227 --> 02:34.378
Well, I know
you don't like her, and...

02:34.471 --> 02:35.654
Wait, are you texting her back?

02:35.839 --> 02:36.989
No, I'm texting my mom.

02:37.140 --> 02:38.640
She's asking me
where I put the sour cream.

02:38.659 --> 02:40.384
She's making smoked salmon
spread for your party

02:40.402 --> 02:42.736
because, well, I was gonna
surprise you tonight,

02:42.888 --> 02:44.721
but I got this chamber pot
on eBay

02:44.740 --> 02:45.906
that's perfect to put dip in.

02:46.058 --> 02:47.833
Salmon spread in an old toilet

02:48.026 --> 02:50.911
is exactly the vibe
this party needs.

02:51.005 --> 02:52.320
<i> (Judy groans)</i>

02:52.339 --> 02:53.897
(gasps)
What is it, Judy?

02:53.916 --> 02:55.565
Are your stocks
not performing well?

02:55.584 --> 02:57.676
No, Stacie B's parents
are out of town,

02:57.827 --> 02:59.069
and everyone's going over there,

02:59.162 --> 03:01.329
and four people
have bailed on my party.

03:01.348 --> 03:03.423
I heard last time
Stacie B had a party,

03:03.575 --> 03:06.018
some people found her dad's
erotic coaster collection

03:06.245 --> 03:07.928
he bought in Amsterdam.

03:08.022 --> 03:09.596
Sounds like a nightmare.

03:09.748 --> 03:11.005
Well, Crispin and I will be

03:11.025 --> 03:13.266
at your murder mystery party
with birds on.

03:13.419 --> 03:14.601
I think it's actually bells.

03:14.695 --> 03:17.254
Okay, but the bells
might startle the birds.

03:17.272 --> 03:21.366
(groans) What am I gonna do
about the four noes?

03:21.593 --> 03:22.350
Moon?

03:22.444 --> 03:23.777
Yes, Judith?

03:23.929 --> 03:25.537
I know that you and your friends
were going to be here

03:25.689 --> 03:27.188
doing your role-playing game
tonight...

03:27.282 --> 03:28.690
Lizards in the Library.

03:28.709 --> 03:31.025
Right. Do you think you could
convince Henry, Russell,

03:31.045 --> 03:34.621
and Debbie to, as they say,
revel in the salon?

03:34.773 --> 03:37.607
Fine, but only if you'll play
with us next week.

03:37.701 --> 03:39.292
We'll be down one
because Debbie's going

03:39.386 --> 03:41.127
to ice-skating junior nationals.

03:41.222 --> 03:43.296
She didn't qualify,
but she's gonna go anyway

03:43.449 --> 03:45.039
to throw stuff
at the people who did.

03:45.133 --> 03:47.392
-(phone dings)
-Oh, no, no one else can cancel.

03:47.544 --> 03:49.877
Oh, phew, it's just spam
asking if I want to meet

03:49.897 --> 03:52.122
"big-boobied singles
in my area."

03:52.215 --> 03:55.308
"Maybe some other... time."

03:55.461 --> 03:56.643
(knocking)

03:56.795 --> 03:59.479
Oh, hello, Alyson.

03:59.631 --> 04:00.555
Oh, hello, Beef.

04:00.649 --> 04:01.764
Just dropping by these props

04:01.817 --> 04:03.133
for Judy's big shindig tonight.

04:03.226 --> 04:04.576
You guys are gonna have fun.

04:04.803 --> 04:05.911
(laughs):
Oh, not me.

04:06.138 --> 04:08.247
I have strict instructions
to stay out,

04:08.398 --> 04:10.640
so I've made a date
to watch a movie

04:10.659 --> 04:12.809
in the guesthouse
with Wolf and Honeybee.

04:12.902 --> 04:14.311
Fun!
What time should I get there?

04:14.404 --> 04:16.496
-What?
-What time should
I arrive for our date?

04:16.590 --> 04:17.981
No, when I said "date..."

04:18.000 --> 04:19.407
8:00?
I might be a little late.

04:19.426 --> 04:21.651
I'm helping a friend
wash a bunch of dogs,

04:21.670 --> 04:24.170
so, sorry if I arrive wet.

04:24.265 --> 04:25.747
Oh, boy.

04:25.841 --> 04:29.009
I accidentally invited Alyson
to hang out with us tonight,

04:29.103 --> 04:31.603
and she thinks
it's a duh... a duh...

04:31.755 --> 04:32.846
Dude ranch?
Dealer's choice?

04:32.998 --> 04:34.756
(gasps)
Dinosaur-themed restaurant?

04:34.850 --> 04:36.108
A date!
Oh, God.

04:36.335 --> 04:37.501
Wait, isn't that a good thing?

04:37.594 --> 04:39.111
You two seem to have
a little spark.

04:39.262 --> 04:41.113
I can't tell.
Maybe she likes me a little,

04:41.340 --> 04:43.690
or maybe I'm just her plaything.
Either way, when she's around,

04:43.842 --> 04:45.433
it's like I'm floating
outside of my body

04:45.452 --> 04:47.344
and I'm also floating
outside of that body

04:47.362 --> 04:50.122
that's floating
outside of the original body.

04:50.273 --> 04:51.606
Beef, you're overwhelmed,

04:51.700 --> 04:53.107
so let's make
the atmosphere of the date

04:53.201 --> 04:54.609
as unsexy as possible.

04:54.628 --> 04:57.037
Great idea. We'll turn
the lights all the way up,

04:57.189 --> 05:00.023
and for snacks we've got
some dried-out deli slices

05:00.025 --> 05:02.542
and the veggies from the back
of the fridge. They've turned.

05:02.694 --> 05:05.529
Perfect. And we'll play a really
non-sensual game, like Jenga.

05:05.622 --> 05:09.641
Okay, and I will just
hang on for dear life.

05:10.144 --> 05:11.125
<i> KIMA:</i>
<i> Good news.</i>

05:11.145 --> 05:12.218
The delivery girl was pulling up

05:12.371 --> 05:13.386
right when I got here.

05:13.539 --> 05:15.038
Oh, and I brought
this chamber pot

05:15.057 --> 05:16.706
of salmon dip and fry bread
my mom made.

05:16.800 --> 05:18.041
Where should I put it?

05:18.060 --> 05:19.893
Just over there.
Oh, no, maybe put it over there?

05:20.045 --> 05:22.729
Aah! I don't know. I'm freaking
out about this party!

05:22.823 --> 05:24.047
Are you kidding?

05:24.216 --> 05:26.049
This is gonna be
the best historical party ever.

05:26.068 --> 05:28.643
People are gonna be like,
<i> "Great Gatsby?</i>

05:28.662 --> 05:30.220
More like<i> Gross Bad-sby."</i>

05:31.314 --> 05:33.165
(British accent):
Welcome, everybody,
to Goosey Gables!

05:33.392 --> 05:34.833
But where is
the lady of the manor?

05:35.060 --> 05:36.501
JUDY (British accent):
Oh!

05:36.728 --> 05:38.728
I forgot I was having
a<i> fête ce soir!</i>

05:38.822 --> 05:39.746
(laughs)

05:39.840 --> 05:41.322
Judy, just so I can plan out
my night,

05:41.416 --> 05:42.566
how long does this game take?

05:42.659 --> 05:43.733
John.

05:43.902 --> 05:45.235
(regular voice):
Well, it says "hours of fun"

05:45.253 --> 05:46.570
on the box, but we could...

05:46.663 --> 05:47.662
Wait, why?

05:47.681 --> 05:49.181
Are you going to Stacie B's?

05:49.408 --> 05:50.331
What? No.

05:50.425 --> 05:51.833
-I mean, we aren't going now.
-"We"?

05:51.852 --> 05:54.744
You know watching people vomit
is an interest of mine.

05:54.763 --> 05:58.598
Guys, let's just focus on this
party and how fun it is, okay?

05:58.750 --> 05:59.933
Judy, you were saying?

06:00.027 --> 06:01.251
Oh, okay.

06:01.269 --> 06:02.419
Well, we can just skip over

06:02.437 --> 06:04.696
the scripted
cocktail party banter, then.

06:04.848 --> 06:06.365
It says here the first step is,

06:06.516 --> 06:09.142
we go around
and introduce our characters.

06:09.294 --> 06:10.610
Ham, you start.

06:10.762 --> 06:14.948
(giggles) I'm Abby Sinthe,
a party girl with a dark secret.

06:15.100 --> 06:18.693
My catchphrase is
"I'll try anything twice."

06:18.787 --> 06:20.437
Hello, Abby.
Who's next?

06:20.455 --> 06:21.605
I'll go.

06:21.623 --> 06:23.548
(stilted):
We are the circus freaks,

06:23.700 --> 06:26.385
brought to entertain
you upper-class scum.

06:26.612 --> 06:29.779
We may be from the circus,
but we ain't a bunch of clowns.

06:29.798 --> 06:30.964
Okay, it's my turn.

06:31.116 --> 06:32.115
(with accent):
'Ello, I'm a washer wench

06:32.208 --> 06:34.226
named Sally Potatoes.

06:34.453 --> 06:35.785
(regular voice):
Okay, I should have
a bigger role.

06:35.804 --> 06:37.787
I have a second cousin
who actually murdered someone,

06:37.806 --> 06:40.214
not to mention
a natural poetry to my speech.

06:40.308 --> 06:42.216
(clears throat)
I'll go next.

06:42.310 --> 06:46.405
I'm Ty T. Wad,
a dangerously frugal butler.

06:46.556 --> 06:48.389
And when it's time,
I will reveal

06:48.409 --> 06:51.058
that I am, in fact,
the murderer.

06:51.153 --> 06:52.411
-Gill!
-Gill.

06:52.562 --> 06:53.803
What? Oh.

06:53.822 --> 06:56.731
You just... you just...

06:56.750 --> 06:58.324
You ruined the whole game!

06:58.477 --> 07:00.919
Well, okay, I guess that's that.

07:01.070 --> 07:02.103
The game's over.

07:02.105 --> 07:03.480
Have fun at Stacie B's.

07:03.498 --> 07:06.240
Great party, Judy.
Sorry it was terrible.

07:06.260 --> 07:10.503
Guys, maybe take some pizza
because it's-a too-a big.

07:10.597 --> 07:12.764
(all scream)

07:12.991 --> 07:14.582
GILL:
That's not pizza!

07:14.601 --> 07:15.750
Anyone want a slice

07:15.769 --> 07:19.012
of giant underwear
with skid marks?!

07:19.164 --> 07:22.149
I'll try anything twice.

07:25.929 --> 07:27.837
GILL:
My God, what kind of monster

07:27.931 --> 07:28.763
would do something like this?

07:28.782 --> 07:29.948
KIMA:
There's a note.

07:30.099 --> 07:31.599
-Judy, grab it.
-(gasps) You're right.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.860
That handwriting
looks just like mine.

07:34.012 --> 07:36.012
We're definitely
dealing with a psychopath.

07:36.105 --> 07:38.439
"You thought you'd have
a big, fun party,

07:38.459 --> 07:41.126
"but things just got
a little sharty.

07:41.353 --> 07:42.869
"I've taken your hot n' cheesy

07:42.963 --> 07:44.871
"and left these drawers
to make you queasy.

07:44.965 --> 07:47.357
"Don't bother trying
to pin me down.

07:47.375 --> 07:50.284
I can't get caught,
I'm not a clown."

07:50.304 --> 07:51.861
It says it's not a clown?

07:51.880 --> 07:53.697
Easy.
That means it<i> is</i> a clown.

07:53.790 --> 07:54.881
One of the circus freaks.
Boom.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.866
Oh, wait, that's me.
Not guilty.

07:56.960 --> 07:59.928
If I wanted to show you guys
my underwear with poop in it,

08:00.038 --> 08:00.870
I'd just do it.

08:00.889 --> 08:02.296
Well, I'll tell you one thing--

08:02.316 --> 08:03.815
no one's going anywhere
until we find out

08:03.967 --> 08:07.377
who took our pizza and left us
with this extra large mystery.

08:07.470 --> 08:10.046
Uh, yeah, you would literally
have to drag me out of here.

08:10.065 --> 08:12.974
Oh. So you guys aren't
going to Stacie B's anymore?

08:12.993 --> 08:16.386
Now? Judy, we're being targeted
by a creepy underpants maniac.

08:16.479 --> 08:17.996
This is all I've ever wanted.

08:18.147 --> 08:20.240
I'm scared.
Ham, please place your hand

08:20.392 --> 08:21.574
on my shoulder comfortingly.

08:21.727 --> 08:22.834
-(thunderclap)
-(gasping)

08:23.061 --> 08:24.744
Oh, sorry. That's
the text notification sound

08:24.896 --> 08:26.004
when my mom texts.

08:26.155 --> 08:27.822
She wants to know
if I took my gummy vitamin.

08:27.841 --> 08:30.175
-(thunderclap)
-And she asked
if everyone was being nice.

08:30.402 --> 08:31.676
Aw. Yes!

08:31.828 --> 08:33.345
<i> HONEYBEE:</i>
<i> Okay, we've got</i>

08:33.572 --> 08:34.513
bright light, gross meat,

08:34.664 --> 08:36.330
a single bowl of oatmeal,
for some reason.

08:36.424 --> 08:38.350
It's unsexy<i> and</i> confusing.

08:38.501 --> 08:40.668
-We did an amazing job.
-(knocking)

08:41.504 --> 08:43.246
Who ordered a pair
of giant jugs?

08:43.339 --> 08:45.415
-Oh, God.
-I brought chocolate milk.

08:45.433 --> 08:47.433
Yeah!
Let's get this party started!

08:47.528 --> 08:48.935
(groans)

08:49.287 --> 08:51.530
All right, so I was supposed to
be the investigator in the game,

08:51.681 --> 08:54.181
but I guess I'll just walk us
through the steps instead.

08:54.276 --> 08:57.277
Step one is identify
any possible suspects.

08:57.429 --> 08:59.445
I know. Maybe it was the people
at the pizza place.

08:59.598 --> 09:02.115
Maybe there's a crazy giant
who works there,

09:02.267 --> 09:04.617
pooping and not wiping

09:04.711 --> 09:06.545
and then putting his underwear--

09:06.696 --> 09:08.288
or hers-- in boxes.

09:08.440 --> 09:09.381
Let's call.

09:09.550 --> 09:10.940
<i> -(phone rings)</i>
<i> -CJ: Thanks for calling</i>

09:11.034 --> 09:13.051
DeGigantico's Pizza.
It's-a too-a big!

09:13.202 --> 09:14.719
Uh-huh. One sec.

09:14.871 --> 09:17.055
Amelia, did you take the pizza
out by Aspen Road?

09:17.206 --> 09:18.706
Does anyone else work here, Mom?

09:18.800 --> 09:19.966
Well, they want to know,
did you take out the pizza

09:20.118 --> 09:21.893
and leave a big pair
of underwear in the box?

09:22.120 --> 09:24.211
Nope. Just a regular
a-too big-a pizza.

09:24.306 --> 09:26.565
No, my daughter says she didn't
leave a big pair of underwear

09:26.792 --> 09:28.567
in the box, just a regular
a-too big-a pizza.

09:28.794 --> 09:30.384
But since you say
you didn't get your pizza,

09:30.478 --> 09:32.070
we'll get a new one to you
in 30 minutes.

09:32.221 --> 09:33.888
It's-a bye-bye!

09:33.907 --> 09:35.481
Well, I guess it wasn't them.

09:35.634 --> 09:37.224
That checks out.
When I carried it in,

09:37.319 --> 09:38.802
it was heavy, like pizza,

09:38.820 --> 09:39.819
not light, like underwear.

09:39.971 --> 09:41.487
And you can see
the grease stains.

09:41.640 --> 09:43.156
The pizza was in here.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.642
So if it wasn't
the pizza ladies,

09:45.660 --> 09:47.644
you know what that means.

09:47.662 --> 09:49.254
It's definitely one of us.

09:49.405 --> 09:51.147
This has Debbie
written all over it.

09:51.166 --> 09:54.575
-Ugh.
-Just this morning, she
called me a smelly skid mark.

09:54.702 --> 09:55.927
-Me too.
-And me.

09:56.079 --> 09:56.911
Which I loved.

09:57.005 --> 09:58.597
Makes sense.
She's escalating.

09:58.748 --> 10:00.098
Like a serial killer.

10:00.249 --> 10:02.508
I called you all skid marks
because that's what you are.

10:02.603 --> 10:04.085
I mean, look at your faces.

10:04.179 --> 10:05.829
Skid mark, skid mark, skid mark.

10:05.847 --> 10:08.273
I don't make the news about
your faces-- I just report it.

10:08.424 --> 10:11.443
Stop! We're not getting anywhere
accusing each other like this.

10:11.594 --> 10:13.186
We need to move on
to the next step,

10:13.280 --> 10:14.762
examining the physical evidence.

10:14.781 --> 10:16.281
We've already looked at the box.

10:16.432 --> 10:18.508
Now it's time to take a look
at everyone's underwear.

10:18.526 --> 10:20.267
I'm just gonna tell you
right now,

10:20.362 --> 10:21.694
mine is a neck-to-ankle
<i> Richie Rich</i> onesie

10:21.847 --> 10:23.771
and I refuse to be ashamed.

10:23.790 --> 10:24.956
<i> ALYSON:</i>
<i> You know,</i>

10:25.183 --> 10:27.042
the steadiest part of the
human body is the mouth.

10:28.462 --> 10:29.628
My God.

10:29.855 --> 10:31.037
Say your farewells.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.631
Your dad might die tonight.

10:32.782 --> 10:35.467
Ooh. Maybe I'll try one
of these... vegetables.

10:35.618 --> 10:38.878
Oh, no. Did I leave a whole
zucchini on that platter?

10:38.972 --> 10:41.030
(chewing sounds)

10:41.049 --> 10:42.123
Weird.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.033
But not sexual.

10:44.127 --> 10:45.368
-Oh, my.
-Oh, no.

10:45.387 --> 10:47.370
-It's working on him.
-Ooh!

10:47.463 --> 10:49.481
Deli meat! I like
to bite a hole out of the center

10:49.632 --> 10:51.724
of the deli slice
and lick around the edges.

10:51.877 --> 10:53.801
It's where the good salt is.
Mmm.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.636
-(chewing sounds)
-Oh, Lord.

10:55.730 --> 10:57.897
Excuse me for one moment.

10:58.049 --> 10:59.699
(laughing)

11:02.570 --> 11:04.053
(muffled groaning)

11:04.072 --> 11:05.555
Okay. So,

11:05.648 --> 11:07.407
anything and everything
she's doing is working on you.

11:07.501 --> 11:09.150
But you can still
turn this around.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.484
When you go back in there,

11:10.578 --> 11:12.912
bring up the least sexy thing
you can think of.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.080
I guess I could try.

11:14.249 --> 11:15.748
What if I asked her
if she'd like to whittle

11:15.901 --> 11:17.342
some hardwood sometime?

11:17.569 --> 11:19.844
-Beef, no.
-Yep, I'll think
of something else.

11:19.996 --> 11:22.906
Underwear on.
Check, check.

11:22.924 --> 11:24.516
Russell.
Underwear, please.

11:24.667 --> 11:25.909
Oh.
No, thank you.

11:25.927 --> 11:27.410
Russell, we all
showed our underwear,

11:27.429 --> 11:29.354
and I accidentally showed
the top of my butt crack.

11:29.581 --> 11:32.081
-For compliments.
-Well, it was very long.

11:32.100 --> 11:33.249
Oh, thank you, sweetie.

11:33.268 --> 11:34.767
Okay, okay, fine.
You got me.

11:34.861 --> 11:36.177
I'm not wearing underwear!

11:36.196 --> 11:38.012
I have a clinically
claustrophobic wiener!

11:38.031 --> 11:39.513
It's diagnosed!

11:39.533 --> 11:42.091
Guys, Russell is too much of a--
how do I put this kindly--

11:42.185 --> 11:43.776
a doof to pull this off.

11:43.929 --> 11:45.428
(sighs)
Thank you, Henry.

11:45.521 --> 11:47.447
Well, who did it then?
We're getting nowhere.

11:47.541 --> 11:49.282
-(doorbell rings)
-(gasping)
-Oh, God.

11:49.376 --> 11:52.026
Oh, right.
(chuckles) The new pizza.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.454
Uh, my mom said
you had underwear in your pizza,

11:54.548 --> 11:56.197
so we, like,
legally had to replace it.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.291
But this time
I'm opening it in front of you

11:58.443 --> 12:00.109
and showing you that it's pizza

12:00.203 --> 12:01.444
and walking it all the way in,

12:01.463 --> 12:03.204
'cause I'm not driving here
again.

12:03.298 --> 12:04.872
Wait, aren't you in our grade?

12:04.891 --> 12:06.725
Yeah. Amelia.
I just started.

12:06.876 --> 12:08.209
My mom used to homeschool me

12:08.303 --> 12:09.969
because she didn't want me
around so many white kids.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.546
But then we got to
the trigonometric ratios chapter

12:12.640 --> 12:13.732
in algebra and she said,

12:13.959 --> 12:15.216
"You know what?
I don't need this."

12:15.310 --> 12:17.643
-(gasping, screaming)
-BETHANY: Now we're talkin'.

12:17.796 --> 12:18.737
HENRY:
Aah! More underwear!

12:18.964 --> 12:20.146
RUSSELL:
Aah! The pizza!

12:20.298 --> 12:22.490
-(gasps) Pepper-oh-no-ni.
-We're all gonna die!

12:26.562 --> 12:28.137
Okay, what in the hell
is going on here?

12:28.231 --> 12:29.897
Someone at this party

12:29.916 --> 12:32.566
has kidnapped
and/or destroyed two pizzas

12:32.660 --> 12:36.904
and presented us with two pairs
of defecated drawers.

12:36.998 --> 12:38.572
Okay, wait, did somebody
bring two pairs

12:38.592 --> 12:41.167
of poop underwear with them or
did they poop during the party?

12:41.319 --> 12:42.668
And which is more diabolical?

12:42.763 --> 12:46.247
Uh, idea-- would you want
to stay and be our investigator?

12:46.266 --> 12:49.267
You're not a suspect and you're
obviously amazing at questions.

12:49.418 --> 12:51.494
Oh, absolutely. I could use
a little break from my mom.

12:51.587 --> 12:53.663
I love her, but,
whenever she eats, she says...

12:53.681 --> 12:55.515
(Scottish accent):
"Get in ma belly" first.

12:55.609 --> 12:56.590
I've had enough.

12:56.610 --> 12:57.758
Okay.
Well, then...

12:57.778 --> 12:59.611
(Scottish accent):
get in ma party!

12:59.762 --> 13:01.762
I feel like you didn't
hear a word I just said.

13:01.782 --> 13:03.339
Sorry, sorry.
I'm sorry.

13:03.358 --> 13:04.857
So we can backtrack to the step

13:05.010 --> 13:06.509
where the detective
interrogates suspects.

13:06.528 --> 13:08.435
-Sure.
-If you want,
I could be your partner.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.179
No, thank you.
I work alone.

13:10.273 --> 13:12.198
-Oh, she's good.
-Trying to flatter me, huh?

13:12.292 --> 13:14.309
I'll talk to you first.

13:14.311 --> 13:16.019
I've only known you
for 13 minutes,

13:16.037 --> 13:18.354
but I've gathered
that you love drama.

13:18.373 --> 13:19.689
Enough to create some
of your own?

13:19.707 --> 13:20.799
(gasps)
How dare you.

13:20.950 --> 13:22.616
Shove me up against a wall.
Shove me!

13:22.710 --> 13:24.285
I know it was you.
You're obsessed with underwear.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.029
You think poop is hilarious.

13:26.047 --> 13:27.363
Yeah.
You know who else does?

13:27.382 --> 13:29.048
A little lady named America.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.476
You think I wanted big undies
at my party?!

13:31.703 --> 13:32.702
Well, I didn't.

13:32.795 --> 13:34.037
How do you explain<i> this?</i>

13:34.055 --> 13:36.372
Oh, this is a letter
I wrote to my dad

13:36.465 --> 13:38.983
for Father's Day telling him
I think he's doing a great job.

13:39.135 --> 13:41.377
Well, I found it on the fridge,
and it's very nice.

13:41.396 --> 13:42.378
Confess!

13:42.471 --> 13:43.470
I never ate my twin in the womb

13:43.565 --> 13:45.214
like I've been claiming
my whole life.

13:45.233 --> 13:48.384
She just disappeared,
and I miss her every damn day.

13:48.477 --> 13:49.886
I downloaded<i> Nights in Rodanthe</i>

13:49.904 --> 13:51.312
when my parents
went out one night.

13:51.406 --> 13:52.980
I've seen things
you wouldn't believe.

13:52.999 --> 13:55.316
I'm just very content
in my life right now.

13:55.335 --> 13:56.576
I feel like
I'm making great choices.

13:56.728 --> 13:58.578
Why would you want
to ruin Judy's party?

13:58.730 --> 14:00.246
I wouldn't!
She's my best friend for life.

14:00.398 --> 14:03.007
I'd rather cut off my own butt
than ruin her party,

14:03.159 --> 14:04.509
and I love my butt.

14:04.660 --> 14:05.844
Oh, I wish I did this.

14:05.995 --> 14:07.737
It's the only good thing
I've ever seen.

14:07.755 --> 14:09.681
Okay! Once a month,
I take a sip of my mom's perfume

14:09.908 --> 14:12.350
and then fill it with water
so she doesn't notice!

14:12.501 --> 14:14.577
-Is that all?
-Yes. Wait, no.

14:14.637 --> 14:17.522
I didn't invent iced tea.
I just really like it.

14:17.673 --> 14:18.857
I've heard enough.

14:19.008 --> 14:20.917
Honestly, I find it just as fun

14:20.935 --> 14:22.527
to put Jenga away
as it is to play it.

14:22.678 --> 14:24.604
I wonder why they never talk
about that in the commercials.

14:24.698 --> 14:28.032
Speaking of commercials, there
was one for chicken breasts...

14:28.259 --> 14:29.868
Permafrost! Um...

14:30.019 --> 14:33.371
Anyone here interested
in... permafrost?

14:33.522 --> 14:36.099
Oh, yes.
Isn't it just amazing?

14:36.117 --> 14:37.709
Did you know
permafrost can go as deep

14:37.936 --> 14:39.769
as two miles into the Earth?

14:39.862 --> 14:42.863
I didn't. Why are you
so interested in permafrost?

14:42.883 --> 14:44.198
Oh. It's dumb.

14:44.292 --> 14:46.109
It is certainly not dumb.

14:46.202 --> 14:47.568
-It's un-dumb.
-I just...

14:47.629 --> 14:49.779
I find it fascinating
that way down in the Earth

14:49.797 --> 14:50.963
are these plants.

14:51.116 --> 14:52.949
I mean, they're still alive,
just, you know,

14:52.967 --> 14:54.800
waiting to be discovered
and thawed out.

14:54.895 --> 14:56.543
And, whenever I feel depressed,

14:56.638 --> 14:58.712
I just think
about those little plants,

14:58.732 --> 15:00.064
and it cheers me up to know

15:00.291 --> 15:02.549
there's all this living stuff
underneath us,

15:02.644 --> 15:04.627
just waiting to bloom.

15:04.646 --> 15:06.404
I've never thought of it
like that.

15:06.631 --> 15:09.223
So, should we watch some
old Arsenio Hall tapes or...

15:09.317 --> 15:11.058
Sweetheart, shut the hell up.

15:11.077 --> 15:12.726
Roger that.

15:12.746 --> 15:13.912
All right.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.896
-I'm ready to solve the mystery.
-Wait, wait, wait!

15:15.990 --> 15:17.657
While you were doing
the interrogations,

15:17.809 --> 15:20.234
I looked in both pizza boxes
again for clues

15:20.328 --> 15:21.661
and I found kitty litter.

15:21.813 --> 15:25.331
I think somebody made
those skid marks with cat poop.

15:25.425 --> 15:28.651
Aw.
(singsongy): Who here has a cat?

15:28.744 --> 15:29.928
(gasps)
Gill.

15:30.079 --> 15:31.487
Gill has a cat.

15:31.506 --> 15:33.005
(breathy chuckling)

15:33.158 --> 15:34.991
Oh. Do I?

15:35.084 --> 15:35.992
Do I?!

15:36.085 --> 15:38.102
(cackling)

15:38.997 --> 15:41.940
Oh, my God.
A Ziploc of cat turds?

15:42.091 --> 15:43.499
So you did it?

15:43.518 --> 15:45.351
Yeah.
I did it.

15:45.445 --> 15:46.352
But why?

15:46.446 --> 15:47.594
Why? Why?

15:47.689 --> 15:49.948
Because I go
to a million parties, Judy.

15:50.175 --> 15:52.599
-A million?
-And nobody even knows
I'm there.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.177
No one remembers me.

15:54.195 --> 15:56.862
But, tonight, I made my mark.

15:57.015 --> 15:58.181
My skid mark.

15:58.199 --> 16:00.199
-How did you do it?
-Like I just said--

16:00.293 --> 16:02.276
people rarely know
I'm even there.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.111
So when the first pizza arrived,

16:04.130 --> 16:06.297
I just walked over, took it out

16:06.449 --> 16:09.408
and put a pair of my
Grammy Beavers' underwear in it,

16:09.560 --> 16:11.970
which I pre-skid-marked
with cat poop.

16:12.121 --> 16:14.138
But, Gill, you've always
had a big crush on Judy.

16:14.290 --> 16:15.640
Why would you ruin her party?

16:15.867 --> 16:18.125
I guess I'm just a bad boy.

16:18.144 --> 16:19.644
The kind that Judy likes.

16:19.795 --> 16:20.979
-Nope.
-What?

16:21.206 --> 16:22.981
I said nope.
I'll tell you what's cat poop--

16:23.208 --> 16:24.207
this confession.

16:24.225 --> 16:25.725
And the cat poop...

16:25.877 --> 16:27.376
(gasping, groaning)

16:27.395 --> 16:29.061
-Oh, my God!
-No!
-...is delicious.

16:29.155 --> 16:30.804
-What?
-Huh?
-Because it's chocolate.

16:30.898 --> 16:32.639
And the fact that
Gill has a crush on Judy

16:32.734 --> 16:35.159
was the final clue I needed
to find the real culprit.

16:35.386 --> 16:37.311
It wasn't you, Gill.
It was Kima.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.238
-(thunderclap)
-Huh?

16:39.390 --> 16:42.083
Sorry. Mom again. Making sure
I put in my retainer.

16:46.564 --> 16:47.730
But, Kima, why?

16:47.749 --> 16:51.217
How? You-you wanted
to ruin my party?

16:51.402 --> 16:55.179
Uh-uh. She did it because
she wanted to<i> save</i> your party.

16:55.406 --> 16:56.239
Oh.

16:56.332 --> 16:58.349
I... get it... now.

16:58.501 --> 16:59.925
It's okay
if you don't get it, baby.

17:00.078 --> 17:02.245
Okay. Well, then
I do not get it now.

17:02.263 --> 17:05.081
Amelia's right. The inspiration
hit at school this morning.

17:05.174 --> 17:07.525
I saw your face when you heard
about Stacie B's party.

17:07.676 --> 17:09.769
You were worried,
and you had reason to be.

17:09.921 --> 17:11.420
I love your parties, Judy.

17:11.439 --> 17:13.606
Like the party
where you gave us three hours

17:13.758 --> 17:14.774
to make our own newspaper.

17:14.868 --> 17:17.035
Super stressful but super fun.

17:17.262 --> 17:19.686
But we're getting older, and now
the parties kids want to go to

17:19.706 --> 17:21.781
are basically just drinking
and making out.

17:21.875 --> 17:24.709
So, I wanted tonight
to be unforgettable.

17:24.860 --> 17:26.544
<i> In the hallway,</i>
<i> I told you I texted my mom,</i>

17:26.771 --> 17:29.772
<i> but, really, I texted Gill</i>
<i>and asked if he wanted to help.</i>

17:29.791 --> 17:31.624
<i>He texted back 45 heart emojis.</i>

17:31.718 --> 17:32.942
<i> We were in business.</i>

17:32.960 --> 17:34.443
<i>I met Gill out front. He gave me</i>

17:34.462 --> 17:36.203
the underwear.
I gave him the chocolate turds.

17:36.297 --> 17:39.282
We made some marks. Then I put
the turds in my pocket.

17:39.300 --> 17:41.300
<i> KIMA:</i>
<i> Then we stashed the pizza</i>
<i> in Gill's car</i>

17:41.452 --> 17:43.135
<i> and put the underwear</i>
<i> and the note in the box.</i>

17:43.288 --> 17:45.805
And then Gill cleverly outed
himself as the murderer,

17:45.957 --> 17:48.307
ruining the murder mystery
but starting the real party.

17:48.459 --> 17:51.294
I am, in fact, the murderer.

17:51.312 --> 17:52.478
But what about
the second underwear?

17:52.630 --> 17:54.146
We weren't planning on
a second pizza,

17:54.240 --> 17:55.556
so we had to improvise.

17:55.650 --> 17:56.908
And as luck would have it,

17:57.135 --> 17:58.651
I had a second pair of undies
in my backpack,

17:58.745 --> 17:59.985
because I love my Grammy Beavers

18:00.138 --> 18:01.971
and I always want
to have her with me.

18:02.064 --> 18:04.082
Okay, we're just
not reacting to that?

18:04.233 --> 18:05.658
Okay. Okay. Okay.

18:05.810 --> 18:07.159
After the phone call
to the pizza place,

18:07.312 --> 18:08.994
I knew I had exactly 30 minutes.

18:09.147 --> 18:10.588
<i> So I had a quick sidebar</i>
<i> with Gill.</i>

18:10.739 --> 18:12.331
<i> AMELIA:</i>
<i> When I walked in</i>
<i> with the pizza,</i>

18:12.425 --> 18:14.483
<i> everyone was in the room</i>
<i> except Kima.</i>

18:14.502 --> 18:17.002
I'll admit, I have no idea
how she made the lights go off.

18:17.097 --> 18:18.337
I know if you plug in two things

18:18.431 --> 18:19.597
<i> in the bathroom</i>
<i> at the same time...</i>

18:19.824 --> 18:21.157
<i> JUDY:</i>
<i> The fuse blows.</i>

18:21.175 --> 18:23.008
I remembered
from when we played hair salon

18:23.103 --> 18:25.010
-and made paninis in there.
-When it went dark,

18:25.163 --> 18:27.830
<i>I put the underwear in the box.</i>
<i> I felt so alive!</i>

18:27.849 --> 18:29.607
<i> AMELIA:</i>
<i> And he threw the pizza</i>
<i> at the wall.</i>

18:29.834 --> 18:31.758
<i> When I heard</i>
<i> Gill had a crush on Judy,</i>

18:31.778 --> 18:33.594
<i> it all fell into place.</i>

18:33.646 --> 18:36.505
I knew who had taken the fall
for Kima's crazy scheme.

18:36.599 --> 18:38.841
Someone who would do anything
to make tonight fun.

18:38.934 --> 18:40.993
You got some
good friends here, Judy.

18:43.514 --> 18:45.105
Well, I thought
this murder mystery party

18:45.199 --> 18:46.607
was gonna be really dumb.

18:46.701 --> 18:48.868
But this is only
the second slow clap of my life.

18:48.962 --> 18:50.536
The first is when
my Aunt Katherine

18:50.630 --> 18:53.280
finally told my mom
no one likes her lasagna.

18:53.299 --> 18:54.632
She puts bananas in it!

18:54.783 --> 18:56.208
Anyway, great party, Judy.

18:56.361 --> 18:59.286
I'm a little sad that no one
vomited, but I enjoyed myself.

18:59.305 --> 19:01.472
-(all agreeing)
-That was a fun night.

19:03.534 --> 19:05.125
Good night, Gill.
And thanks.

19:05.145 --> 19:08.729
It was an honor to turd
my grandma's underwear for you.

19:11.209 --> 19:13.209
Okay. (chuckles)
So we're cool?

19:13.227 --> 19:14.602
Well,<i> you're</i> cool.

19:14.712 --> 19:16.729
I'm just happy
to be your kinda nerdy friend.

19:16.881 --> 19:18.138
You're not my nerdy friend.

19:18.158 --> 19:19.715
You're my best friend.

19:19.808 --> 19:21.217
I mean, you're the only person
who's ever come

19:21.310 --> 19:23.828
to me and my mom's
very secret berry picking spot.

19:23.979 --> 19:26.055
My dad doesn't even know
where it is.

19:26.073 --> 19:27.665
And I'll never tell him.

19:27.816 --> 19:30.059
So, guys, if I call my mom,
can I join this slumber party?

19:30.077 --> 19:32.244
I invite myself to things.
Homeschool!

19:32.397 --> 19:33.746
I have no social skills.

19:33.898 --> 19:36.007
Then we have a lot in common.

19:37.010 --> 19:39.235
So, I guess
we're both interested

19:39.328 --> 19:40.678
in permafrost tunnels.

19:40.829 --> 19:42.922
Yes, but it might be a mistake

19:43.016 --> 19:46.242
for us to go to one together
right now.

19:46.335 --> 19:47.334
Indeed.

19:47.386 --> 19:50.763
It's been a long time
since I, uh...

19:50.915 --> 19:53.749
went into a permafrost tunnel.

19:53.768 --> 19:57.269
Yes. And I think I would want
to visit a permafrost tunnel

19:57.422 --> 19:58.754
with you more than once

19:58.773 --> 20:00.756
and also talk to you,

20:00.775 --> 20:02.349
which is rare for me.

20:02.443 --> 20:04.593
Well, I believe
this is your car.

20:04.687 --> 20:05.761
That is a large rock.

20:05.780 --> 20:07.112
Correct.
Sorry.

20:07.265 --> 20:09.189
You make me nervous.

20:09.283 --> 20:11.751
You make me nervous, too.

20:13.028 --> 20:14.629
Night, Beef.

20:18.701 --> 20:20.867
(groaning)

20:20.887 --> 20:24.204
Mmm. This pizza's not bad
for being thrown against a wall.

20:24.257 --> 20:26.799
Hey, Jude. Heading to bed.
How was your party?

20:26.951 --> 20:29.785
There was a lot more underwear
than we were expecting.

20:29.804 --> 20:30.561
How was your date?

20:30.788 --> 20:33.956
It was too much and not enough.

20:33.975 --> 20:36.292
You're a child
I haven't seen before.

20:36.310 --> 20:38.294
-Name's Amelia.
-Hello, Amelia.

20:38.312 --> 20:39.962
Her family owns DeGigantico's.

20:40.055 --> 20:43.132
I love that place.
It's-a too-a big-a.

20:43.225 --> 20:44.391
Good night, ladies.

20:44.410 --> 20:46.969
So, Amelia,
when you bit into that cat poop,

20:46.988 --> 20:48.913
how sure were you
that it was chocolate?

20:49.064 --> 20:50.973
Eh, 50%, 60%?

20:51.066 --> 20:53.142
Wow. That is wild.
(chuckles)

20:53.160 --> 20:55.478
(Scottish accent):
Get in ma friendship.
