00:00.701 --> 00:02.102
- ♪

00:02.202 --> 00:04.004
- We got another letter
from the insurance company

00:04.104 --> 00:06.139
about Miss Anastasia.

00:06.240 --> 00:08.108
She drove over the
neighbor's mailbox.

00:09.610 --> 00:10.544
- Ay...

00:10.644 --> 00:12.479
- Her driving is
getting worse and worse.

00:12.579 --> 00:13.614
We gotta do something.

00:13.714 --> 00:15.382
- Uh, we might have to
take her keys, baby.

00:15.482 --> 00:18.752
- Her car got more
scratches than DJ Jam.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.087
Whoop, whoop, whoop--

00:21.655 --> 00:22.623
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:22.723 --> 00:23.790
Where are you going
dressed like that?

00:23.891 --> 00:24.858
The Oscars or something?

00:24.958 --> 00:26.727
- You're so funny!

00:26.827 --> 00:28.962
The Oscars aren't
until February.

00:29.062 --> 00:30.764
I'm going clothes shopping.

00:30.864 --> 00:35.602
One can never be too sure
when the paparazzi might pop up.

00:35.702 --> 00:40.440
- Uh, how you gettin' there?
- Oh, I'm driving, of course.

00:40.541 --> 00:43.343
- Oh, you know, we got this
new thing called a rideshare.

00:43.443 --> 00:46.146
It's so cool. You can just sit
back and relax the whole time

00:46.246 --> 00:48.248
and--and let somebody else
drive.

00:48.348 --> 00:52.219
- And park.
- I don't follow.

00:52.319 --> 00:53.987
- I don't know how to
say this, Miss Anastasia,

00:54.087 --> 00:56.089
but I--I think it's time
you stopped driving.

00:56.190 --> 00:58.659
- Oh, don't be silly.

00:58.759 --> 01:03.263
My third husband, Enzo, he was
a Formula One racecar driver.

01:03.363 --> 01:05.199
Oh, I'll never forget that time

01:05.299 --> 01:07.100
that we pulled over
on the Autobahn.

01:07.201 --> 01:10.270
The first thing he did
was check under my hood,

01:10.370 --> 01:12.172
and then he checked my airbags.

01:12.272 --> 01:14.374
And then he took
his dipstick and he--

01:14.474 --> 01:18.111
- Hey, whoa whoa whoa, hey.
We got young ears in here.

01:18.212 --> 01:19.513
Hey, man, go eat your breakfast.

01:19.613 --> 01:22.182
- Sorry, I just get carried
away when I think about Enzo,

01:22.282 --> 01:26.286
the most handsome man
that I ever laid...

01:26.386 --> 01:28.789
eyes on.

01:28.889 --> 01:30.991
- With me being the one
who runs the, you know,

01:31.091 --> 01:32.426
day-to-day here at the facility,

01:32.526 --> 01:34.494
it's kind of my duty
to let you know

01:34.595 --> 01:36.129
I'd feel a lot more
comfortable

01:36.230 --> 01:38.298
if you stopped driving.

01:38.398 --> 01:41.502
- And I'd feel a lot more
comfortable if you would stop

01:41.602 --> 01:44.938
with these outrageous
allegations.

01:45.105 --> 01:46.707
Reginald has experience
with the law.

01:46.807 --> 01:49.743
And I'm wondering if this
is either slander or libel.

01:49.843 --> 01:52.312
- Uh, I don't think it's either.

01:52.412 --> 01:54.381
- Miss Anastasia, we
do care about you.

01:54.481 --> 01:56.617
- Right.
- But it may be a good idea

01:56.717 --> 01:59.920
to retire your car keys.

02:00.053 --> 02:04.791
- Okay, well, if that's what
everybody agrees to, then...

02:04.892 --> 02:07.127
then to assume you're all fools!

02:11.865 --> 02:14.268
- She told y'all.

02:14.368 --> 02:17.538
You're all fools!

02:17.638 --> 02:21.308
- Don't do that.
Don't mock adults.

02:21.408 --> 02:23.477
- Well, since we're on
the subject of driving...

02:23.577 --> 02:26.380
- No.
- I didn't get to finish.

02:26.480 --> 02:27.814
- We already know
what you're gonna say.

02:27.915 --> 02:29.416
You've been asking about it
for the last three months.

02:29.516 --> 02:31.251
- Well, when is
a good time for me

02:31.351 --> 02:33.153
to get my learner's permit?

02:34.855 --> 02:37.357
- Philip, we know how badly
you want this, but look, man,

02:37.457 --> 02:40.227
there's a lot of crazy
drivers out there.

02:40.327 --> 02:41.728
That was one right there.

02:43.730 --> 02:45.966
- Come on, Dad.
I'm ready. I'm 15.

02:46.099 --> 02:47.868
- We'll talk about
it later, all right?

02:47.968 --> 02:49.803
- Mm-hmm. Fools.

02:49.903 --> 02:50.871

I mean, 15 is the age

16:59.118 --> 17:02.288

where you can get
your learner's permit.

17:02.388 --> 17:04.290

- Are we talking about
15 human years

17:04.390 --> 17:06.258

or was that in boy years?

17:06.358 --> 17:10.429

'Cuz that's about seven or
eight, or like nine or ten.

17:10.529 --> 17:14.967

- Wow. Sexist much?
- Mm.

17:15.067 --> 17:17.136

- Look, some of us
are immature, okay?

17:17.236 --> 17:19.171

But not all of us.

tongue stuck to the flagpole.

17:22.908 --> 17:23.976

17:24.076 --> 17:25.611

- The fireman had to
come peel you off, right?

17:25.711 --> 17:27.146

bring that up again?

17:27.246 --> 17:28.714

Are we going there?

17:28.814 --> 17:30.316

- That's right.
- That wasn't my fault.

17:30.416 --> 17:32.017

You know, they
double dog dared me.

17:32.117 --> 17:33.552

- Oh, oh, okay.

17:33.652 --> 17:35.521

It's not just that
he's a boy, baby.

17:35.621 --> 17:38.390

It's that he's a boy
and he's a teenager.

17:38.490 --> 17:41.293

You know, teenagers are three
times more likely to get into

17:41.393 --> 17:43.329

car accident, right?

17:43.429 --> 17:45.531
- You know, every time you get
on the search engine and start

17:45.631 --> 17:47.199
looking up stuff,
then you scare yourself.

17:47.299 --> 17:50.736
You gotta stop that.
- Mm-hmm.

17:50.836 --> 17:52.705
- Well, remember that time
you looked on the internet

17:52.805 --> 17:55.407
and found out how many spiders
a person eats in their sleep?

17:55.507 --> 17:56.942
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

17:57.042 --> 17:59.879
Yeah, you up for 48 hours
straight with a fly swatter

17:59.979 --> 18:02.414
in one hand and
a golf club in the other.

18:02.515 --> 18:04.617
- We eat eight spiders
a year, Jeremy.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.652
A year.
Eight--eight spiders.

18:06.752 --> 18:08.754
I can't!
I just--I--I just can't.

18:08.787 --> 18:10.422
- Okay.
- Whoo! Ugh!

18:10.523 --> 18:13.125
- Well, what I can't do is let
that boy get his driving permit,

18:13.225 --> 18:15.394
because that's what
keeps me up at night.

18:15.494 --> 18:16.762
- He'll learn.

18:16.829 --> 18:19.765
Uh, pardon my
unsolicited advice.

18:19.865 --> 18:22.835
But, uh, I don't believe you
two knew anything about, uh,

18:22.935 --> 18:25.905
running an assisted living
facility before you did it.

18:26.005 --> 18:27.540
- Ooh.
- I mean, that's true.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.575
We did almost lose
our shirts.

18:29.675 --> 18:31.510
- Yeah, but look at you now.

18:31.610 --> 18:34.213
The proprietors
of a thriving....

18:34.313 --> 18:37.883
uh, still open facility.

18:37.983 --> 18:39.351
- You know what, Mr. Reginald?

18:39.451 --> 18:40.853
You might be on to something.

18:40.953 --> 18:43.989
I guess we were two people
with zero experience.

18:44.089 --> 18:47.560
- That's because we as
human beings learn by doing.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.395
- Don't get me
wrong, Mr. Reginald.

18:49.495 --> 18:51.263
He has a lot of great qualities.

18:51.363 --> 18:53.866
But, um, responsibility
just isn't his strong suit,

18:53.966 --> 18:55.367
you know what I'm saying?

18:55.467 --> 18:57.770
- Yeah, but driving is one
of the greatest teachers of

18:57.870 --> 19:00.039
responsibility in
the modern world.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.608
- Yeah, right behind
a good switch.

19:02.741 --> 19:05.110
- LEAH: Mm.
- I'm just kidding.

19:05.211 --> 19:09.748
I never put my hands on my kids.
[laughs]

19:09.815 --> 19:11.784
I mean, I've
thought about it, haven't I?

19:11.884 --> 19:14.253
That's not a crime.

19:14.353 --> 19:16.322
Is it?

19:16.422 --> 19:18.257
- Think of all the things
Phillip will have to learn

19:18.357 --> 19:19.625
once he gets his license.

19:19.758 --> 19:22.261
He'll have to keep the
tires properly inflated,

19:22.361 --> 19:24.830
fill the tank, change the oil,

19:24.930 --> 19:28.167
and maintain the
registration and insurance.

19:28.267 --> 19:30.903
- Something tell me we
just need to wait on this.

19:31.003 --> 19:34.273
- You know...there's
such a thing as, uh,

19:34.373 --> 19:36.075
crippling your son, right?

19:36.175 --> 19:38.577
I once had a case
come before me.

19:38.677 --> 19:42.047
A mother and a father
sued their son

19:42.147 --> 19:44.984
for refusing to leave
and be out on his own.

19:45.084 --> 19:46.519
- Wow. I didn't know it
was legal

19:46.619 --> 19:48.287
for parents to sue a teenager.
- Huh!

19:48.387 --> 19:49.321
- Teenager?

19:49.421 --> 19:52.625
The son was 37!
- Whoa!

19:52.791 --> 19:54.994
- You either let
your kid grow up

19:55.094 --> 19:58.597
or be prepared to take care
of him for the rest of his life.

19:58.731 --> 20:01.433
- Well, my gut just
had a change of heart.

20:01.534 --> 20:02.902
- Mine too!

20:04.737 --> 20:06.338
You know what, Mr. Reginald?
Thank you.

20:06.438 --> 20:09.642
Uh, we were a little nervous
about him getting his permit,

20:09.742 --> 20:11.277
but you're right.

20:11.377 --> 20:13.512
I think this is gonna
be a good thing for him.

20:13.612 --> 20:18.350
So I'm gonna go ahead and make
that appointment at the DMV.

20:19.652 --> 20:20.886
- Okay.

20:20.986 --> 20:24.790
- ♪

20:26.458 --> 20:28.460
- So, what is clouding your
blue skies this morning,

20:28.561 --> 20:30.563
young Philip?

20:30.663 --> 20:32.932
- Young Philip. Exactly.

20:33.032 --> 20:34.366
I'm tired of being young.
- Huh.

20:34.466 --> 20:36.936
Because it is more fun
being old like me, huh?

20:37.036 --> 20:38.871
Well, every morning
I go on safari,

20:38.971 --> 20:40.272
looking for little white hairs

20:40.372 --> 20:43.075
that decided to grow
in my nose and my ears

20:43.175 --> 20:44.810
instead of on top of my head.

20:46.879 --> 20:48.948
- No, no, no.
Not old-old like you.

20:51.150 --> 20:52.218
No offense.

20:54.353 --> 20:55.287
I just wish my parents

20:55.387 --> 20:56.589
would stop treating me
like such a kid.

20:56.722 --> 20:59.992
- Ah. Sit.

21:03.729 --> 21:06.599
Let me tell you
about your homeland.

21:06.732 --> 21:08.434
- Oh, I already know
a lot about my homeland.

21:08.534 --> 21:09.869
- Oh, you do!
- Yeah.

21:09.969 --> 21:12.805
Lenox Mall, the Falcons.

21:12.905 --> 21:14.306
Oh, lemon pepper wings...

21:14.406 --> 21:15.407
- Okay, yes, yes.

21:15.507 --> 21:19.745
The great state of
Georgia is your home.

21:19.778 --> 21:22.748
But your homeland
is where I was born.

21:22.781 --> 21:25.017
- Africa?
- Yes. Africa.

21:25.117 --> 21:27.520
Where there are
five rites of passage.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.622
Birth.

21:29.755 --> 21:31.156
Adulthood.

21:31.257 --> 21:32.324
Marriage.

21:32.424 --> 21:33.425
Eldership.

21:33.526 --> 21:35.327
And ancestorship.

21:35.427 --> 21:38.030
Now, a boy of your age should
be getting ready for adulthood.

21:38.130 --> 21:42.468
- Ah, then we can turn up!
- Not so fast.

21:42.568 --> 21:45.137
A new initiate like yourself
would be taken away from

21:45.237 --> 21:48.140
the--the--the structures
of the community,

21:48.240 --> 21:50.843
where you'll be taught
social responsibility.

21:50.943 --> 21:52.912
Now, after you've learnt
your lessons

21:53.012 --> 21:54.146
and you come back to
the village,

21:54.246 --> 21:57.983
yeah yeah, ah, that
is when you get to dancing

21:58.083 --> 22:00.085
and party, yes, and music!

22:00.186 --> 22:01.887
- Okay, cool, music and dancing!

22:01.987 --> 22:03.756
- And the best part
of the whole night

22:03.856 --> 22:05.257
usually is the circumcision.

22:05.357 --> 22:07.293
- Oh, cool, it's like a--
wait, wait. What?

22:07.393 --> 22:09.061
- Oh, no, no, it's
not a big deal.

22:09.161 --> 22:11.630
The elder takes
a small scissors.

22:11.730 --> 22:14.567
Snip, snip!

22:14.733 --> 22:16.735
It doesn't happen
in every tribe.

22:16.835 --> 22:18.370
I keep telling you people here.

22:18.470 --> 22:20.739
Stop thinking of Africa
the way you see it on TV.

22:20.806 --> 22:22.575
It is not like that.

22:22.741 --> 22:24.643
Africa is very vast and diverse.

22:24.743 --> 22:29.882
Look, in many parts, we have
modern cities just bustling

22:29.982 --> 22:32.284
with modern conveniences
and technology.

22:32.384 --> 22:35.654
- Oh, like Wakanda?
- No! Ugh...

22:35.754 --> 22:37.590
Sort of, sort of.

22:37.756 --> 22:41.760
But there are also rural
communities that boast a more,

22:41.827 --> 22:44.463
uh, uh, uh, communal setting.

22:44.563 --> 22:46.932
So, my point is this.

22:47.032 --> 22:50.870
Every culture has its own
type of rite of passage.

22:50.970 --> 22:53.839
But what every tribe
has in common is

22:53.939 --> 22:55.975
it is not you that decides

22:56.075 --> 22:59.478
when you move from
one stage of life to the next.

22:59.578 --> 23:01.547
It is for your elders to say.

23:01.714 --> 23:06.085
And in your tribe, Philip,
your elders are your parents.

23:07.920 --> 23:10.956
- Philip, darling.
We have some good news.

23:11.056 --> 23:12.191
- Wait, wait.

23:12.291 --> 23:14.126
So this means I can
get my learner's permit?

23:14.226 --> 23:17.997
- Mm, your dad and I
were talking and, um,

23:18.097 --> 23:20.900
we got some good advice
from Mr. Reginald.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.601
[sighs] We think it's
time you get your--

23:22.735 --> 23:24.370
- [car crashes]

23:25.604 --> 23:26.839
- Anastasia!

23:26.939 --> 23:28.474
Baby, go get your dad!
Come on!

23:31.176 --> 23:32.077
- ♪

23:32.177 --> 23:33.913
- Miss Anastasia,
are you okay?

23:34.013 --> 23:35.881
- No, I'm not okay.

23:35.981 --> 23:38.217
And neither is my
car or your elm tree.

23:38.317 --> 23:40.019
- Miss Anastasia,
nobody cares about--

23:40.119 --> 23:41.187
that car can be replaced.

23:41.287 --> 23:44.089
And nobody cares about
that elm tree, okay?

23:44.190 --> 23:47.259
All that matters is that you are
okay and no one else is injured.

23:47.359 --> 23:49.261
- Those poor kids
at that crosswalk,

23:49.361 --> 23:54.133
I didn't even see them
until the last minute.

23:54.233 --> 23:57.903
What if I had--I had hit
them and they were killed?

23:58.003 --> 24:00.239
I never would've been
able to live with myself.

24:00.339 --> 24:03.842
- They are fine.
They are alive and so are you.

24:03.943 --> 24:06.512
- No. Not anymore.

24:06.612 --> 24:09.815
- Well, what do you
mean, Miss Anastasia?

24:09.915 --> 24:13.719
- I'm Anastasia Devereaux.

24:13.819 --> 24:16.722
I've hiked the Kilimanjaro.

24:16.789 --> 24:21.160
I've dozed under
the Aurora Borealis.

24:21.260 --> 24:25.097
I've--I've eaten
at the Parthenon.

24:25.197 --> 24:29.501
I've done all of that and
I've gone back for seconds.

24:29.602 --> 24:32.037
And now...

24:32.137 --> 24:36.075
I'm here at this place
that is...

24:36.175 --> 24:39.311
officially my prison.

24:39.411 --> 24:42.248
- Well, I know it's not
the Ritz Carlton, Miss--

24:42.348 --> 24:45.184
- Oh, oh, oh, no,
darling, no, look.

24:45.284 --> 24:48.087
This place is wonderful
and so are all of you.

24:48.187 --> 24:50.523
I sincerely mean that.

24:50.623 --> 24:56.362
It's just that now I can't go
where I want or do what I want.

24:56.462 --> 25:00.332
It's like I'm a--a cockatoo
whose wings have been clipped

25:00.432 --> 25:02.735
and I'm just stuck in this cage.

25:04.103 --> 25:07.306
- I--I know this is difficult.

25:07.406 --> 25:11.844
But in my culture, the elder,
they hold the highest of status.

25:11.944 --> 25:15.214
- An elder in my country is
an old person on television

25:15.314 --> 25:17.116
who falls and says,
help, I can't--

25:17.216 --> 25:18.484
I've fallen, I can't get up.

25:18.584 --> 25:21.320
- Uh, uh, don't consider
giving up driving

25:21.420 --> 25:24.356
as a loss of privilege.
Huh?

25:24.456 --> 25:27.293
Think of it as a--
as a perk of old age.

25:27.393 --> 25:30.596
- How can I consider losing
my freedom as a perk?

25:30.729 --> 25:34.500
- Ooh, ooh, did Cleopatra
drive her own gilded chariot?

25:34.600 --> 25:35.968
- [laughs]

25:36.068 --> 25:38.103
- Yeah! No!

25:38.204 --> 25:42.208
A woman of your stature
should be chauffeured.

25:42.308 --> 25:47.513
- This is just one of the worst
days of my wonderful life.

25:47.613 --> 25:49.615
I bid you all goodnight!

25:49.748 --> 25:53.586
- ♪

25:54.487 --> 25:55.922
- ♪

25:56.022 --> 25:58.558
- So, uh, you were
gonna tell me something

25:58.658 --> 26:01.327
before we got interrupted?

26:01.427 --> 26:04.864
- Not--not that I can recall.
You were gonna say something?

26:04.964 --> 26:07.133
- No, doesn't sound familiar.
I don't know.

26:07.233 --> 26:09.602
- I know you guys were gonna say
that I could my learner's permit

26:09.702 --> 26:11.838
before Miss Anastasia
got in her accident.

26:11.938 --> 26:15.441
- Yeah, see, the key word
there, Son, is "before."

26:15.541 --> 26:16.809
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
That's not fair.

26:16.909 --> 26:18.578
- Okay, life isn't fair.

26:18.678 --> 26:20.346
Um, what about those
kids in that crosswalk?

26:20.446 --> 26:23.382
They were about to understand
that life wasn't fair earlier

26:23.483 --> 26:24.750
this morning.

26:24.851 --> 26:27.687
- Yeah, see, Son, just hearing
that crash and the metal

26:27.787 --> 26:30.423
and seeing what that
tree did to her car?

26:30.523 --> 26:31.924
Just made us
reconsider, that's all.

26:35.161 --> 26:37.530
- Okay, we're not saying
that you will never get

26:37.630 --> 26:38.998
your learner's permit.

26:39.098 --> 26:43.002
But we are saying that the
timing isn't quite right.

26:43.102 --> 26:45.505
- But Sandra got her
permit when she was my age.

26:45.605 --> 26:47.073
- Sandra's a girl.

26:47.173 --> 26:49.342
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
What is that supposed to mean?

26:49.442 --> 26:53.179
- Did you know that teenage boys
are twice as likely

26:53.279 --> 26:55.782
than teenage girls to get
into an auto accident?

26:55.882 --> 26:58.184
- Dad, you let her
back on the internet?

26:58.284 --> 26:59.685
- Hey!

26:59.786 --> 27:01.687
- You know, I was gonna put
the parental controls on,

27:01.788 --> 27:03.656
but then I remembered
that she's a parent herself

27:03.689 --> 27:06.058
and she know how
to turn it off, so...

27:06.159 --> 27:07.860
- But you don't agree
with that, right?

27:07.960 --> 27:10.163
- Of course I don't--
- Oh, oh, buddy.

27:10.263 --> 27:12.799
Now, before you answer that
question, answer this one.

27:12.899 --> 27:15.468
When's the last time
you've seen a teenage girl

27:15.568 --> 27:18.771
with her tongue
stuck to a flagpole?

27:18.871 --> 27:19.972
- Oh, you're gonna
go there, huh?

27:20.072 --> 27:21.507
- Yeah, when you
go low, I go lower.

27:21.674 --> 27:22.675
[chuckles]

27:22.742 --> 27:24.811
- I'm gonna plead the Fifth.

27:24.911 --> 27:28.047
- Man card, Dad. Give it up.

27:28.147 --> 27:30.583
- There's a lot we wanna
tell you about driving.

27:30.683 --> 27:33.119
And...honestly, Son,
we just worry

27:33.219 --> 27:35.688
that you're not
the best listener.

27:35.788 --> 27:39.125
- Huh?
- See?

27:39.225 --> 27:40.493
- No, I say "Huh?"

27:40.593 --> 27:41.894
because I think I
am a good listener.

27:41.994 --> 27:43.896
I mean, when somebody's
telling me something valuable.

27:43.996 --> 27:47.233
- Hey, hey, hey,
tread lightly, Son.

27:47.333 --> 27:49.335
- Did you guys know that there
are five rites of passage

27:49.435 --> 27:50.837
in Africa?

27:50.937 --> 27:54.974
Birth, adulthood, marriage,
eldership, and ancestorship.

27:55.074 --> 27:56.742
And that they hold celebrations
to mark the passage

27:56.843 --> 27:58.644
from one stage of life
to the next?

27:58.744 --> 28:00.980
- No, we didn't.
[clears throat]

28:01.080 --> 28:03.116
- Yeah, the question is,
how do you know that?

28:03.216 --> 28:06.119
- Because Efe told me,
and I listened to him.

28:06.219 --> 28:08.154
Look, when you guys
teach me how to drive,

28:08.254 --> 28:09.989
I'm going to be
a good listener,

28:10.089 --> 28:12.525
because I wanna be
safe and responsible.

28:12.658 --> 28:13.826
Because it's important.

28:13.926 --> 28:16.529
Especially after
what happened today.

28:16.662 --> 28:18.364
- Okay, we know you do.

28:18.464 --> 28:21.968
But, I mean, our job
is to protect you, baby,

28:22.068 --> 28:23.469
and that's what we wanna do.

28:23.569 --> 28:26.672
- It's your decision when I move
on to the next stage of life.

28:26.773 --> 28:30.209
- Yes, it is.
- And that I have to be patient.

28:30.309 --> 28:33.679
And that...when you guys are
100% sure that I'm mature enough

28:33.780 --> 28:36.249
to get my permit, then
that's when I'll get it.

28:40.686 --> 28:41.687
- What just happened?

28:41.721 --> 28:43.055
- I don't know.
Whose son is that?

28:44.957 --> 28:45.992
- [sighs] Okay.

28:46.092 --> 28:47.894
Hey, Philip, hold
up, man, hold up.

28:47.994 --> 28:50.530
Come here. [sighs]

28:50.696 --> 28:54.333
Look, man, uh...we actually
made you an appointment

28:54.434 --> 28:56.803
at the DMV today, all right?

28:56.903 --> 28:57.904
And I didn't cancel it yet.

28:58.004 --> 28:59.071
- Wait, wait, wait.

28:59.172 --> 29:00.706
So this means I can
get my learner's permit?

29:00.807 --> 29:02.041
- Yes, that's what it means.

29:02.141 --> 29:06.646
But we really, really need
you to understand how much

29:06.712 --> 29:08.548
responsibility it
takes to drive a car.

29:08.648 --> 29:11.250
- Yes, especially after what
happened to Miss Anastasia

29:11.350 --> 29:12.718
earlier today.

29:12.819 --> 29:16.656
Like, a car, Philip,
is so unforgiving.

29:16.756 --> 29:20.460
One tiny mistake,
one lapse in judgement,

29:20.560 --> 29:22.929
or skipping to the next song...

29:23.029 --> 29:26.666
can cost you your life and
somebody else's, possibly.

29:26.732 --> 29:28.201
- Do you understand that, Son?

29:28.301 --> 29:30.269
- Yes, Dad, I understand.
- Okay.

29:30.369 --> 29:32.105
You also understand
you have a written exam?

29:32.205 --> 29:34.073
'Cuz I know you like
to skip labs and stuff.

29:34.173 --> 29:35.741
- Mm-hmm.

29:35.842 --> 29:37.677
- Yes, I already
started studying.

29:37.710 --> 29:39.979
I found the study guide online.

29:40.079 --> 29:42.582
- Snap, look at the internet
working for the good!

29:42.682 --> 29:44.183
Ha, ha! Told you!
- Wait, wait.

29:44.283 --> 29:47.053
Did you guys also know
that the Earth is really flat?

29:47.153 --> 29:49.922
And that Tupac is alive
on a tropical island

29:50.022 --> 29:51.591
drinking Mai Tais
with Big Foot?

29:55.027 --> 29:56.496
- Hey. Don't mind me,
Miss Anastasia.

29:56.629 --> 29:59.165
I just--I talk a lot
when I get nervous, girl.

29:59.265 --> 30:03.636
I, uh, you know--I just, I think
I get nervous when I take tests.

30:03.703 --> 30:04.904
- Let me tell you something,

30:05.004 --> 30:08.341
the test I was most nervous
about was when I was at

30:08.441 --> 30:11.878
the Silverdome, backstage
on the Super Freak tour.

30:11.978 --> 30:13.679
- Oh...
- With Rick James!

30:13.780 --> 30:16.249
- [screams] You're
gonna make me curse!

30:16.349 --> 30:19.018
- Thank god I passed.
- Wait, though.

30:19.118 --> 30:21.721
Did you have to take a
test to get backstage?

30:21.821 --> 30:22.822
- No silly.

30:22.922 --> 30:24.257
I'm talking about
a pregnancy test.

30:24.357 --> 30:25.725
- BOTH: [laughing]

30:25.825 --> 30:27.393
- Miss Anastasia, you crazy!

30:27.493 --> 30:30.663
- 1981 was my prime, girl!

30:30.730 --> 30:32.031
Any baby that
was gonna breastfeed

30:32.131 --> 30:33.299
on these little puppies,

30:33.399 --> 30:35.201
they was gonna have
to have had take a number!

30:35.301 --> 30:37.703
- LEAH: Okay!
- BOTH: [laughing]

30:37.804 --> 30:40.239
- Oh! Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, come on.

30:40.339 --> 30:41.674
Don't keep your momma
in suspense, now!

30:41.741 --> 30:43.142
Come on, out with it!

30:43.242 --> 30:46.112
- How many feet before a turn
do you turn your blinkers?

30:46.212 --> 30:48.748
Like, how am I
supposed to know that?

30:48.848 --> 30:50.983
- Boy, what do you mean how
am I supposed to know that?

30:51.083 --> 30:53.753
You said you've been studying!
What's wrong?

30:53.853 --> 30:55.621
- Exactly!

30:55.721 --> 30:56.956
And that's why I passed!

30:57.056 --> 30:59.759
- [screams, laughs]

30:59.859 --> 31:02.295
- BOTH: Ah!

31:02.395 --> 31:05.098
- Boy, you really made
your mother proud!

31:05.198 --> 31:07.366
- Babe, Philip aced it.

31:07.467 --> 31:09.168
I mean, then when I
let him drive home,

31:09.268 --> 31:12.872
he did so well that you would
think that he's been driving

31:12.972 --> 31:14.006
his whole life.

31:14.107 --> 31:16.642
Boy, you've been
taking my car at night?

31:16.709 --> 31:18.144
- Oh, look, come
on, come with me.

31:18.244 --> 31:20.513
Uh, Mr. Efe set
something up for you.

31:20.646 --> 31:23.416
I wanna show you.

31:23.516 --> 31:25.485
Right, stop right
here, stop right here.

31:25.651 --> 31:29.455
All right, ready?

31:29.555 --> 31:31.691
- ADULTS: Surprise!

31:31.791 --> 31:33.059
- What's this?

31:33.159 --> 31:34.727
- It's celebration!
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

31:34.827 --> 31:38.164
Who is Phil-lip?
It's Philip with one L.

31:38.264 --> 31:40.399
- Oh, the only one
they had had two L's.

31:40.500 --> 31:42.668
It's the thought
that counts now, huh?

31:42.702 --> 31:47.540
You have officially passed
to your next stage of life.

31:47.673 --> 31:51.544
- Wait, so I'm an adult now?
- You're not a whole adult yet.

31:51.677 --> 31:55.815
But this is a big step
in that direction.

31:55.915 --> 31:57.316
- Thanks for taking
the time to do this,

31:57.416 --> 31:59.485
even though you
misspelled my name.

31:59.619 --> 32:02.922
But, what would you
do if I didn't pass?

32:03.022 --> 32:05.658
- We had total faith in you.

32:05.758 --> 32:08.027
But our backup was to pretend
that we're celebrating

32:08.127 --> 32:09.328
Reginald's brithday again.

32:09.429 --> 32:13.166
- Efe! Ah, you wasn't
supposed to tell him that!

32:13.266 --> 32:16.736
[laughs] Let me see
it, let me see it.

32:16.836 --> 32:19.138
Ooh! Let me see it.

32:19.238 --> 32:20.706
- What's the matter?

32:20.807 --> 32:24.210
Your normal radiance seems like
it's behind some storm clouds.

32:24.310 --> 32:26.979
- Seeing Philip get his license,
it just reminds me

32:27.079 --> 32:29.348
that I have no more firsts
to look forward to.

32:29.449 --> 32:33.920
- Oh no! There are
many firsts to be had. Hm?

32:34.020 --> 32:36.089
It's just at our age,
they're not as flashy.

32:36.189 --> 32:39.792
[chuckles]
But they are there

32:39.892 --> 32:41.928
if you keep your eyes
open for them.

32:42.028 --> 32:45.665
Hm? Everybody--

32:45.765 --> 32:47.667
- [taps on glass]
- Everybody!

32:47.733 --> 32:49.202
And now my favorite part of

32:49.302 --> 32:52.672
the adult rite of passage
celebration.

32:52.705 --> 32:54.674
Where is my small scissors?

32:54.774 --> 32:56.943
- [laughs] Good one.

32:57.043 --> 32:58.878
- Ooh...

32:58.978 --> 33:01.047
- I'm dead serious.

33:01.147 --> 33:02.348
- I gotcha, baby.

33:03.983 --> 33:06.352
- I love chips and salsa!

33:06.452 --> 33:09.689
- [laughter]

33:09.789 --> 33:11.124
- Snip, snip, snip...

33:11.224 --> 33:13.326
- Oh, Efe, you scared my baby!
What you doing?

33:14.260 --> 33:16.162
- I'll just get my
grandpa, don't worry.

33:16.262 --> 33:18.631
Actually, hold on,
let me call you back.

33:20.667 --> 33:22.802
Hey, Miss Anastasia.

33:22.902 --> 33:26.206
So, you know, I just got
my driver's permit and...

33:26.306 --> 33:27.774
if my parents say it's okay,

33:27.874 --> 33:29.509
I'd like to take you
to your appointments.

33:29.609 --> 33:31.177
- That is so sweet of you.

33:31.277 --> 33:33.446
But wouldn't you rather spend
time with your friends on

33:33.546 --> 33:37.584
FaceGram and InstaTwit and...

33:37.684 --> 33:39.352
I hope I say it right...

33:39.452 --> 33:41.654
SnapTalk?

33:41.754 --> 33:44.691
- SnapTalk?

33:44.791 --> 33:46.926
But look, um, I'd love
to drive you around.

33:47.026 --> 33:49.095
I mean, I need the practice.

33:49.195 --> 33:50.730
Plus, I bet you got
a whole bunch of crazy stuff--

33:50.830 --> 33:52.565
no, no, interesting.

33:52.665 --> 33:54.200
Interesting stories to tell.

33:54.300 --> 33:57.704
- Being chauffeured by a bright
young man like yourself

33:57.804 --> 34:00.640
is indeed a first!

34:00.740 --> 34:04.644
Would you mind terribly
wearing a driver's cap

34:04.744 --> 34:08.381
and some of those
crisp white gloves?

34:08.481 --> 34:11.217
- I, uh--I just don't have
that in my, uh--in my closet.

34:11.317 --> 34:13.887
- Okay, so me calling you
Morgan Freeman

34:13.987 --> 34:15.622
while you tool me around town,

34:15.722 --> 34:18.391
I guess that's
out of the question, too?

34:18.491 --> 34:20.627
- Who's that?

34:20.727 --> 34:22.195
- Driving Miss Daisy?

34:24.130 --> 34:25.832
Oh, Philip.

34:25.932 --> 34:29.269
We have a lot to talk about.
