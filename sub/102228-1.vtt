02:59.375 --> 03:01.735
Excuse me.

03:03.295 --> 03:06.415
Come on, honey, let's
get you ready for bed.

03:18.625 --> 03:20.715
I am no one special,

03:20.755 --> 03:23.695
just a common man
with common thoughts.

03:23.725 --> 03:25.995
I've led a common life.

03:26.035 --> 03:27.935
There are no monuments
dedicated to me.

03:27.965 --> 03:31.065
And my name
will soon be forgotten.

03:31.105 --> 03:32.905
But in one respect,

03:32.935 --> 03:36.465
I've succeeded as gloriously
as anyone who ever lived.

03:36.505 --> 03:38.605
- Looking good, Duke.
- Feeling good.

03:38.645 --> 03:40.405
I've loved another
with all my heart

03:40.445 --> 03:44.475
and soul and for me
that has always been enough.

03:44.515 --> 03:45.915
How's it hanging, Harry?

03:45.955 --> 03:48.645
I keep trying to die,
but they won't let me.

03:48.685 --> 03:50.715
Well, you can't
have everything.

03:53.895 --> 03:55.125
Big day today.

03:55.165 --> 03:57.855
You say that every day,
you old devil.

03:59.235 --> 04:01.195
It's a lovely day
outside.

04:01.235 --> 04:03.465
Let's take a walk.

04:03.505 --> 04:04.565
I don't think so.

04:04.605 --> 04:06.905
Well, we've got to get
you out of this room.

04:06.935 --> 04:08.535
Come on now, honey.
Some fresh air

04:08.575 --> 04:11.005
- would do you good.
- Hello.

04:12.815 --> 04:15.275
I'm sorry,
it's not a good day.

04:15.315 --> 04:17.285
I don't think
she's up for anything.

04:17.315 --> 04:18.475
Hello?

04:20.315 --> 04:24.315
This is Duke,
he's come to read to you.

04:24.355 --> 04:26.625
Read?

04:27.855 --> 04:30.695
No.
I don't know.

04:30.725 --> 04:34.795
Oh, come on,
you'll like him, he's very funny.

04:46.515 --> 04:47.845
Ahh...

04:49.285 --> 04:53.215
All right now,
where did we leave off?

04:53.255 --> 04:56.585
Oh, yeah, yeah,
it was the night of the carnival.

04:56.625 --> 04:59.755
"Noah, was there with his friends,
Fin and Sarah."

04:59.795 --> 05:02.985
- Noah?
- That's where they met...

05:03.025 --> 05:05.125
June 6th, 1940.

05:06.565 --> 05:08.465
Allie was
17 years old.

05:09.005 --> 05:11.235
- Little man wins a prize.
- Damn!

05:11.275 --> 05:13.505
- Thank you for playing.
- Ha, you're real funny.

05:13.535 --> 05:14.805
Man, I clobbered
that thing.

05:14.845 --> 05:16.805
I'm tellin' you,
these games are fixed.

05:16.845 --> 05:18.465
- Hello.
- How are you?

05:18.515 --> 05:20.445
Hi, what's your name?

05:20.475 --> 05:22.175
Step right up here.

05:22.215 --> 05:24.405
Over the hook, yeah.

05:28.485 --> 05:31.515
- Who's this girl with Sara?
- Her name's Allie Hamilton.

05:31.555 --> 05:33.995
She's here for the summer
with her family.

05:34.025 --> 05:35.325
Dad's got more
money than God.

05:35.365 --> 05:37.455
- Hi, Fin!
- Hi, honey.

05:37.495 --> 05:40.295
Look, I won you a prize.

05:40.335 --> 05:43.665
Oh, Fin, thank you!

05:45.675 --> 05:48.075
- Oww!
- Yeah.

05:48.105 --> 05:49.865
Hey great, huh?

05:49.905 --> 05:51.735
Hey Allie, you want
some cotton candy?

05:51.775 --> 05:53.805
- Umm, okay.
- That would be so much fun.

05:55.645 --> 05:58.245
You only get
one chance, son.

05:58.285 --> 06:00.645
- You want to dance with me?
- No.

06:00.685 --> 06:03.815
- Why not?
- 'Cause I don't want to.

06:03.855 --> 06:06.845
Noah, she's with us.

06:06.895 --> 06:10.795
Hey Allie, you want
to ride the Ferris wheel?

06:10.825 --> 06:12.355
- I'd love to.
- All right.

06:12.395 --> 06:14.025
Excuse me.

06:15.305 --> 06:16.855
Excuse me.

06:20.935 --> 06:23.845
- Noah Calhoun.
- What?

06:23.875 --> 06:26.635
Works down at the lumber yard
with Fin.

06:26.675 --> 06:28.835
Oh...

06:28.885 --> 06:31.845
Did you see he was standing like
two inches away from my face?

06:31.885 --> 06:34.015
Yeah, I saw.
That's Noah, though.

06:35.725 --> 06:37.275
You know I'm surprised
he even came over.

06:37.325 --> 06:38.655
I think he likes you.

06:58.775 --> 07:00.475
Hey what... jerk...

07:00.515 --> 07:03.875
Get off me.
Don't touch me.

07:03.915 --> 07:05.975
- Hey!
- Well, I... ugh!

07:06.015 --> 07:08.005
- What are you doing?
- Hey, you can't do that!

07:08.055 --> 07:09.745
I'll pay you
when I get down, Tommy.

07:09.785 --> 07:11.585
I'm Noah Calhoun.

07:11.625 --> 07:13.715
- So?!
- So, it's really nice to meet you.

07:13.755 --> 07:16.315
- Allie, who is this guy?
- I don't know, Noah Calhoun.

07:16.365 --> 07:18.795
- I would really like to take you out.
- Friend! Do you mind?

07:20.535 --> 07:23.435
You can't sit more than two people
in a chair, Noah.

07:23.465 --> 07:24.935
Okay, Tommy,
all right.

07:27.975 --> 07:30.565
Get down, Noah,
you're gonna kill yourself!

07:30.605 --> 07:31.805
Noah, cut it out.

07:31.845 --> 07:33.505
Now, will you
go out with me?

07:33.545 --> 07:35.205
What?

07:35.245 --> 07:37.185
- No.
- No?

07:37.215 --> 07:38.545
- No.
- No?

07:38.585 --> 07:40.245
Hey pal,
she just told you.

07:40.285 --> 07:41.375
Why not?

07:41.425 --> 07:43.415
I don't know,
because I don't want to.

07:43.455 --> 07:44.475
Noah!

07:44.525 --> 07:46.855
What? Well, you leave me
no other choice then.

07:47.955 --> 07:49.085
Oh my God.

07:49.125 --> 07:50.115
I'm not kidding.

07:50.165 --> 07:51.895
- Noah, stop fooling around.
- What are you doing?

07:51.935 --> 07:54.335
- Noah, grab the bar.
- I'm gonna ask you one more time.

07:54.365 --> 07:55.955
Will you...

07:56.005 --> 07:58.735
- or will you not go out with me?
- Noah, you best come on.

07:58.775 --> 08:01.675
- God damn, my hand's slipping.
- Then grab the bar, you idiot.

08:01.705 --> 08:04.435
- Not until she agrees.
- Ah, go on out with him, honey.

08:04.475 --> 08:06.675
- Okay, okay, fine,
I'll go out with you.

08:06.715 --> 08:07.975
- What?
- No, don't do me any favors.

08:08.015 --> 08:09.345
No, no. I want to.

08:09.385 --> 08:10.715
- You want to? You want to?
- Yes!

08:10.745 --> 08:12.715
- Say it.
- I want to go out with you.

08:12.755 --> 08:15.345
- Say it again.
- I want to go out with you.

08:15.385 --> 08:17.715
All right, all right
we'll go out.

08:17.755 --> 08:20.525
You think
you're so smart, don't you?

08:20.555 --> 08:22.225
That wasn't funny,
Noah, you idiot!

08:22.265 --> 08:25.695
No, it's okay,
I'll take care of this.

08:25.735 --> 08:27.425
What are you doing?

08:27.465 --> 08:28.455
Please don't do that.

08:28.505 --> 08:30.025
Please don't do that, Allie.

08:30.065 --> 08:31.795
I can't believe...

08:31.835 --> 08:33.465
Oh God.

08:35.304 --> 08:37.075
You're not so cocky now,
are ya?

08:37.105 --> 08:38.975
I'm gonna get you for that.

08:39.015 --> 08:41.414
Ah, maybe you will,
maybe you won't.

08:43.985 --> 08:47.285
- Did he say anything to you?
- Oh, yeah, will you look at that?

08:47.315 --> 08:49.215
It's that girl from the Carnival,
right?

08:51.825 --> 08:53.725
Do you remember me?

08:53.755 --> 08:56.245
Yeah, sure,
Mr. Underwear, was it?

08:56.295 --> 08:58.025
- Well, I...
- How could I forget.

08:58.065 --> 08:59.555
Yeah, I wanted to clear
that up with you,

08:59.595 --> 09:01.085
because
I'm really sorry about that.

09:01.135 --> 09:02.425
It was a really stupid thing
to do...

09:02.465 --> 09:04.055
crawl up a Ferris wheel
to talk to somebody.

09:04.105 --> 09:06.005
But I had
to be next to you.

09:06.035 --> 09:08.195
I was being
drawn to you.

09:11.245 --> 09:13.675
Oh... oh, jeez,
what a line!

09:13.715 --> 09:16.075
You use that
on all the girls?

09:16.115 --> 09:17.845
- No.
- Right.

09:17.885 --> 09:20.185
I saw you the other night
with little Miss Ribbons.

09:20.215 --> 09:21.875
- What are you doing tonight?
- What?

09:21.925 --> 09:23.945
Or tomorrow night,
or this weekend, whatever.

09:23.985 --> 09:25.925
- Why?
- Why? Our date.

09:25.955 --> 09:27.215
What date?

09:27.255 --> 09:28.985
- The date that you agreed to.
- No...

09:29.025 --> 09:31.225
Yes, you did.
You promised and you swore it.

09:31.265 --> 09:33.025
Well, I guess
I changed my mind.

09:34.635 --> 09:36.995
Look, I know you get some dirty guy
coming up to you

09:37.035 --> 09:38.555
on the street...
you don't know him.

09:38.605 --> 09:40.435
You don't know me,
but I know me.

09:42.105 --> 09:43.835
And when I see something
that I like,

09:43.875 --> 09:46.205
I gotta ha...
I love it.

09:46.245 --> 09:48.305
I go... I mean,
I go crazy for it.

09:48.345 --> 09:51.115
Okay, what are you
talking about?

09:51.145 --> 09:52.345
Well, you.

09:53.515 --> 09:55.215
Oh, you're good.

09:55.255 --> 09:56.885
- What?
- You're good.

09:56.925 --> 09:59.395
- No. No, you're getting me wrong.
- You're good. You are.

09:59.425 --> 10:00.945
- You're fantastic.
- I'm not.

10:00.995 --> 10:02.855
You really are.
I'm impressed.

10:02.895 --> 10:06.195
- I'm not usually like this, I'm sorry.
- Oh, yes, you are.

10:06.235 --> 10:08.325
I can be fun,
if you want...

10:08.365 --> 10:11.855
pensive, uh, smart,

10:11.905 --> 10:14.635
uh, superstitious,
brave.

10:14.675 --> 10:17.605
And uh... I can be light on my feet.

10:17.645 --> 10:20.205
I could be
whatever you want.

10:20.245 --> 10:22.975
You just tell me what you want
and I'll be that for you.

10:24.115 --> 10:25.545
You're dumb.

10:27.815 --> 10:29.185
I could be that.

10:32.095 --> 10:34.085
Come on, one date.
What's it gonna hurt?

10:34.125 --> 10:35.785
Umm...
I don't think so.

10:35.825 --> 10:37.655
Well, what I can I do
to change your mind?

10:37.695 --> 10:39.635
Guess you'll figure
something out.

10:41.635 --> 10:44.105
- You sure she's coming?
- Relax, pal, it's all set up.

10:44.135 --> 10:45.655
We're meeting her
for the late show.

10:45.705 --> 10:47.535
Look... what did
I tell you? Come on.

10:53.175 --> 10:56.615
Oh my goodness,
what a coincidence!

10:56.645 --> 10:58.375
I need to talk to you
for a second.

10:58.415 --> 11:02.185
- He's here!
- Allie, you remember Noah, don't you?

11:02.225 --> 11:03.205
- Yes, I remember.
- Yeah.

11:03.255 --> 11:05.185
- Come here.
- Fin!

11:05.225 --> 11:06.885
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:06.925 --> 11:09.255
- It's nice to see you again.
- You too.

11:09.295 --> 11:11.455
- You look great.
- Aw, thanks.

11:11.495 --> 11:13.195
Really, really great.

11:13.235 --> 11:14.925
You do look great.
You look great.

11:14.965 --> 11:18.365
And I know I look great,
so could we please go see this movie?

11:18.405 --> 11:21.165
- The show's about to start.
- After you.

11:21.205 --> 11:23.835
You come back here,
Li'I Abner.

11:23.875 --> 11:26.435
You ain't gonna catch me,
Daisy Mae!

11:26.475 --> 11:28.745
It's Sadie Hawkins Day,
I'm supposed to catch you!

11:28.785 --> 11:30.505
I'm faster than you.

11:32.515 --> 11:34.285
No, No!

11:34.315 --> 11:36.515
I'll get you!

11:37.685 --> 11:39.625
I'm going get...

11:39.655 --> 11:41.125
Here I come!

11:41.155 --> 11:43.655
You better run fast!

11:53.275 --> 11:55.265
You ketchum Polecat
far and squar.

12:01.545 --> 12:04.205
Wait for me.

12:04.245 --> 12:06.275
What happened
in that movie?

12:07.615 --> 12:09.785
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

12:11.255 --> 12:13.385
- What are you guys doing?
- Want to walk with me?

12:13.425 --> 12:14.415
Yeah, what's going on?

12:14.455 --> 12:15.895
- Yeah.
- We're gonna walk.

12:15.925 --> 12:18.415
Do you guys
love each other?

12:18.465 --> 12:20.765
Huh?
Oh, I get it.

12:20.795 --> 12:23.595
- You guys do love each other.
- Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

12:23.635 --> 12:24.725
Okay, good bye.

12:24.765 --> 12:27.265
All right, all right.

12:31.345 --> 12:33.405
That was fun.

12:35.345 --> 12:37.745
I haven't seen a movie
in ages.

12:37.785 --> 12:39.545
Really?

12:39.585 --> 12:42.385
Not since
I was a little kid.

12:42.425 --> 12:44.015
What?

12:44.055 --> 12:45.855
No, I..

12:45.895 --> 12:48.485
I'm busy, you know,
I don't have a lot of time.

12:49.795 --> 12:51.225
You're busy?

12:51.265 --> 12:54.855
I have a very
strict schedule.

12:54.895 --> 12:56.665
My days are all
planned out.

12:56.705 --> 13:00.935
I get up in the morning... breakfast,
math tutor, Latin tutor, lunch,

13:00.975 --> 13:04.705
tennis lessons, dance lessons...
sometimes both...

13:04.745 --> 13:08.575
French tutor, piano lesson,
then I eat dinner.

13:08.615 --> 13:10.605
And after dinner
I spend time with my family.

13:10.645 --> 13:13.445
And then I... I catch up
on some reading.

13:19.125 --> 13:20.925
Sounds like the road
to success.

13:20.955 --> 13:22.625
Oh, you bet.

13:22.665 --> 13:24.325
We're applying
to all these colleges...

13:24.365 --> 13:28.825
umm... Radcliffe, Sarah Lawrence...
those are the ones we want.

13:30.505 --> 13:33.405
- And who's we?
- What?

13:33.435 --> 13:35.535
You just said,
"The ones that we want."

13:35.575 --> 13:37.235
Oh, Mom and Daddy.

13:37.275 --> 13:39.075
We decide
everything together.

13:40.445 --> 13:42.645
Everything?

13:42.685 --> 13:44.345
No, not everything.

13:44.385 --> 13:46.115
But the important
things, yes.

13:47.715 --> 13:50.955
And then everything else,
you get to decide all by yourself?

13:52.795 --> 13:55.655
- Don't be rude.
- I'm sorry.

13:58.225 --> 14:01.285
Just trying to figure out
what you do for fun.

14:01.335 --> 14:04.195
What do you mean?

14:04.235 --> 14:06.605
I mean...

14:06.635 --> 14:08.235
I don't know,
I mean all those things

14:08.275 --> 14:10.835
are things you
have to do, right?

14:10.875 --> 14:14.745
So what do you do
because you want to?

14:14.775 --> 14:16.905
I just told ya.

14:19.985 --> 14:21.645
I don't know.

14:21.685 --> 14:24.175
This surprises me.

14:24.225 --> 14:25.515
Why?

14:25.555 --> 14:29.015
I just always figured
you were kinda...

14:29.065 --> 14:30.855
Kinda what?

14:30.895 --> 14:32.195
Just...

14:34.235 --> 14:37.065
- Free.
- What?

14:37.105 --> 14:38.625
Free.

14:40.905 --> 14:43.435
I am free.

14:43.475 --> 14:46.235
You don't seem like it.

14:46.275 --> 14:48.245
Well, I am.

14:50.385 --> 14:52.375
Come here,
I want to show you something.

14:52.415 --> 14:56.085
- Noah, what are you doing?
- Just come on.

14:56.125 --> 14:59.555
- You're gonna get run over.
- By all the cars?

15:07.335 --> 15:08.925
My Dad and I used
to come out here

15:08.965 --> 15:12.695
and lay down and watch
the lights change.

15:12.735 --> 15:15.725
And watch them go
from green to red to yellow.

15:17.375 --> 15:20.135
You could try it,
if you wanted to.

15:20.175 --> 15:22.575
- No.
- Why not?

15:22.615 --> 15:25.375
Because I don't know...
will you just get up?

15:25.415 --> 15:27.815
That's your problem,
you know that?

15:29.155 --> 15:30.675
You don't do
what you want.

15:39.095 --> 15:40.625
Okay.

15:57.845 --> 15:59.815
What happens
if a car comes?

15:59.855 --> 16:01.545
- We die.
- What?

16:01.585 --> 16:03.525
Just relax.
Just trust.

16:03.555 --> 16:05.985
You need to learn
how to trust.

16:07.695 --> 16:09.155
Okay.

16:12.235 --> 16:13.955
Painting.

16:13.995 --> 16:16.555
You asked me
what I do for me.

16:16.605 --> 16:20.335
- What now?
- I love to paint.

16:20.375 --> 16:23.565
Yeah?

16:25.715 --> 16:29.645
Most of the time, I have all these
thoughts bouncing around in my head.

16:29.685 --> 16:32.985
But with a brush
in my hand,

16:33.015 --> 16:35.785
the world just gets
kinda quiet.

16:43.865 --> 16:45.525
Get out of the street!

16:54.375 --> 16:55.395
Are you okay?

16:58.105 --> 17:00.205
Why are you laughing?

17:03.515 --> 17:05.944
Oh, that was fun.

17:10.355 --> 17:12.055
Do you want
to dance with me?

17:13.755 --> 17:14.785
Sure.

17:17.765 --> 17:19.325
Now?

17:19.365 --> 17:20.994
Here?

17:21.035 --> 17:23.625
Not supposed to dance
in the middle of the street.

17:23.665 --> 17:26.765
Who said dance
in the street?

17:26.805 --> 17:28.435
And we don't
have any music.

17:28.474 --> 17:30.945
Well,
we'll make some.

17:39.515 --> 17:42.315
# Bum bum #

17:42.355 --> 17:44.015
# Bum bum bum #

17:44.055 --> 17:45.925
# Bum #

17:45.955 --> 17:48.085
# Bum bum #

17:48.125 --> 17:50.185
# Bum bum bum
bum bum. #

17:50.225 --> 17:52.195
You're a terrible singer.

17:52.235 --> 17:53.825
I know.

17:55.505 --> 17:57.265
But I like this song.

17:57.305 --> 18:04.075
# I'll be seeing you #

18:04.105 --> 18:07.305
# In all the old #

18:07.345 --> 18:10.675
# Familiar places #

18:12.215 --> 18:15.945
# That this heart
of mine #

18:15.985 --> 18:19.755
# Embraces #

18:19.795 --> 18:22.815
# All day
and through #

18:26.995 --> 18:34.835
# In that small cafe #

18:34.875 --> 18:42.745
# The park
across the way #

18:42.785 --> 18:49.185
# The children's
carousel #

18:49.225 --> 18:51.585
- # The chestnut trees... #
- Southern summers

18:51.625 --> 18:53.855
are indifferent
to the trials of young love.

18:53.895 --> 18:56.685
- # The wishing well #
- Armed with warnings and doubts,

18:56.725 --> 19:01.285
Noah and Allie gave a remarkably
convincing portrayal of a boy and a girl

19:01.335 --> 19:04.065
traveling down
a very long road

19:04.105 --> 19:06.295
with no regard
for the consequences.

19:06.335 --> 19:08.035
They fell in love,
didn't they?

19:08.075 --> 19:10.095
- Yes, they did.
- Good.

19:10.145 --> 19:12.805
I like this kind
of story. Go on.

19:18.285 --> 19:19.745
After that night,

19:19.785 --> 19:22.985
Allie and Noah spent
every waking hour together.

19:23.025 --> 19:25.715
And soon
they were inseparable.

19:25.755 --> 19:28.625
- Noah, come on.
- Your boat cannot beat me there.

19:38.765 --> 19:40.965
That's really nice.

19:51.145 --> 19:52.985
"Beautiful dripping fragments.

19:53.015 --> 19:54.715
The negligent list

19:54.755 --> 19:56.945
of one after another,

19:56.985 --> 19:59.355
as I happen to call
them to me.

19:59.395 --> 20:01.255
Or drink to them.

20:01.295 --> 20:03.385
The real poems,
what we call poems,

20:03.425 --> 20:06.765
being merely pictures.
The poems of the privacy of the night.

20:06.795 --> 20:09.765
And of men like me.

20:09.805 --> 20:12.035
This poem,
drooping shy and unseen,

20:12.065 --> 20:15.265
that I always carry.
And that all men carry."

20:15.305 --> 20:17.535
Not bad for Whitman.

20:17.575 --> 20:20.235
Hey, look,
we got a visitor.

20:20.275 --> 20:23.115
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to interrupt.

20:23.145 --> 20:26.045
Well, don't apologize,
come on up here, darling.

20:26.085 --> 20:29.315
We could use a little something here
besides the smell of lumber.

20:30.855 --> 20:32.485
Dad,
this is Allison Hamilton.

20:32.525 --> 20:34.045
Allison,
I'm glad to meet you.

20:34.095 --> 20:35.285
- Allie.
- Allie.

20:35.325 --> 20:36.755
Pleased to meet you,
Mr. Calhoun.

20:36.795 --> 20:39.025
Well Mr. Calho...
What, am I old or something?

20:39.065 --> 20:40.655
You can call me Frank.

20:40.695 --> 20:42.725
- Here, come in and have a seat.
- Okay.

20:43.905 --> 20:46.495
So, Allie.
Well, yeah, she is pretty, son.

20:46.535 --> 20:49.235
- Yes.
- She's a lot prettier than you let on.

20:49.275 --> 20:51.245
- Oh, is that right?
- No, it's not right.

20:51.275 --> 20:52.505
Don't believe what he says.

20:52.545 --> 20:55.135
- What is this you got?
- Umm, I... uh, I just...

20:55.175 --> 20:56.475
I brought you something.

20:56.515 --> 20:59.575
Let me see.
Let's have a look.

20:59.615 --> 21:01.645
Did you do this?

21:01.685 --> 21:03.485
Well, that's beautiful.
Look at that.

21:03.525 --> 21:05.185
That's a damn picture there.

21:06.655 --> 21:09.425
Well, I know just where we can
put that, thank you.

21:09.465 --> 21:12.055
Oh, that was
a lovely poem.

21:12.095 --> 21:13.655
What was it?

21:13.695 --> 21:15.295
- EI...
- Whitman.

21:15.335 --> 21:18.865
See when he was a little kid
he used to stutter real bad.

21:18.905 --> 21:21.465
- Dad...
- So... well, you did.

21:21.505 --> 21:23.565
- I didn't know that.
- God. I stammered.

21:23.605 --> 21:25.045
Stammered, stutter,
what's the difference?

21:25.075 --> 21:27.845
Couldn't understand
a damn thing he said.

21:27.875 --> 21:31.175
So, I got him to read me poetry
out loud.

21:31.215 --> 21:32.685
It wasn't
very pretty at first,

21:32.715 --> 21:33.975
but then his stutter
went away.

21:34.015 --> 21:35.915
Well, it's a good idea,
that poetry.

21:35.955 --> 21:37.475
Yeah, I thought so.

21:37.525 --> 21:40.285
Unbelievable,
unbelievable.

21:40.325 --> 21:42.795
I'm a Tennyson man,
myself, but he likes Whitman...

21:42.825 --> 21:44.695
For some reason,
I don't know.

21:44.725 --> 21:47.255
Say, how would you like some breakfast?
Would you like some breakfast?

21:47.295 --> 21:48.785
- Breakfast?
- Yeah.

21:48.835 --> 21:51.235
- Dad, it's 10:00.
- What's that got to do with it?

21:51.265 --> 21:53.565
You can have pancakes
any damn time of night you want.

21:53.605 --> 21:56.505
- Come on, you want some breakfast?
- Sure.

21:57.845 --> 22:01.005
It was an improbable romance.

22:01.045 --> 22:04.875
He was a country boy.
She was from the city.

22:04.915 --> 22:06.645
She had the world
at her feet,

22:06.685 --> 22:08.875
while he didn't have
two dimes to rub together.

22:13.725 --> 22:15.245
Noah, come on.

22:16.365 --> 22:17.415
Whoo!

22:18.425 --> 22:19.655
Look at us.

22:22.305 --> 22:23.565
What are we doing?

22:23.605 --> 22:26.465
Do you think in another life,
I could have been a bird?

22:28.535 --> 22:29.665
What do you mean?

22:29.705 --> 22:31.835
Like reincarnation.

22:32.875 --> 22:34.745
I don't know.

22:34.775 --> 22:36.335
I think I could.

22:42.755 --> 22:43.985
Say I'm a bird.

22:45.125 --> 22:46.645
No.

22:46.695 --> 22:48.715
- Don't do it.
- Say I'm a bird.

22:48.755 --> 22:50.725
- Stop it. Stop it now.

22:50.765 --> 22:52.525
- You're not.
- Say it!

22:54.495 --> 22:57.055
- You're a bird.
- Yeah.

23:02.745 --> 23:04.605
Now say
you're a bird too.

23:07.345 --> 23:09.505
If you're a bird,
I'm a bird.

23:43.045 --> 23:45.205
- Come on, darling.
- What are you doing?

23:45.245 --> 23:46.945
Don't.
Don't!

23:56.995 --> 23:58.625
Here we go,
on the count of three, okay?

23:58.665 --> 24:01.155
Real easy,
on three, ready?

24:01.195 --> 24:02.755
- Okay, okay.
- One...

24:02.805 --> 24:05.065
- Two... two...
- two...

24:05.105 --> 24:06.665
...three!
- No! I can't.

24:06.705 --> 24:08.895
Get in the water!

24:08.935 --> 24:11.105
- Get in! I'm sorry.
- Come on, chicken.

24:11.145 --> 24:13.075
Get in the water, baby.
Baby, would you get in.

24:13.115 --> 24:15.105
- Get in the water.
- I can't.

24:15.145 --> 24:16.615
- Go!
- Get in the water!

24:16.645 --> 24:17.945
- One...
- Come on, jump.

24:17.985 --> 24:20.045
- Two...
- Three.

24:30.995 --> 24:33.255
Keep 'em together!
No, no, no.

24:33.295 --> 24:35.195
- Get to your place.
- Down here.

24:35.235 --> 24:37.705
And move.
And keep it.

24:37.735 --> 24:38.725
No, don't move it!

24:38.765 --> 24:40.635
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

24:40.675 --> 24:43.135
They didn't agree on much.

24:43.175 --> 24:45.975
In fact, they rarely agreed on
everything. They fought all the time.

24:46.015 --> 24:47.605
- Don't kick me!
- Don't push me.

24:47.645 --> 24:50.045
And they challenged
each other every day.

24:50.085 --> 24:52.135
But despite
their differences,

24:52.185 --> 24:55.115
they had one
important thing in common.

24:55.155 --> 24:57.785
They were crazy
about each other.

24:59.855 --> 25:01.185
Okay,
I have to go.

25:01.225 --> 25:03.285
- No.
- Yes, I do.

25:16.975 --> 25:18.335
Allie.

25:18.375 --> 25:21.675
Daddy.
Oh, Daddy you're...

25:21.715 --> 25:22.735
I didn't see you there.

25:24.715 --> 25:25.705
You kinda scared me.

25:29.055 --> 25:31.025
Becoming friendly
with that boy down there.

25:33.725 --> 25:34.855
Yes.

25:36.165 --> 25:37.755
Bring him
to the house on Sunday.

25:37.795 --> 25:39.765
I want to meet
this young man.

25:39.795 --> 25:42.565
Okay.

25:42.605 --> 25:43.765
Good night, Daddy.

25:43.805 --> 25:45.795
Good night.

25:52.615 --> 25:53.775
Oh, boy.

25:53.815 --> 25:55.575
This bug goes
"Daddy, I don't understand."

25:55.615 --> 26:00.055
He goes, "Well, in theory,
we're both millionaires, but in reality,

26:00.085 --> 26:01.605
we live with
a bunch of whores."

26:06.095 --> 26:07.645
Bishop Stevens
told me that.

26:07.695 --> 26:11.285
Olivier, please remove the... the liquor
decanter from in front of my husband.

26:11.325 --> 26:12.725
I think he's had
a little too much to drink.

26:12.765 --> 26:15.425
- I don't get it.
- Pay attention.

26:15.465 --> 26:18.025
So, what do
you do, Noah?

26:18.065 --> 26:20.935
I work at the lumber yard
with Fin.

26:20.975 --> 26:25.105
Mainly milling and receiving logs...
and stripping the bark.

26:25.145 --> 26:26.635
Oh, that's lovely, dear.

26:26.675 --> 26:28.375
Thank you.

26:28.415 --> 26:30.935
If you don't mind my asking, uh,
how much do you make at your job?

26:30.985 --> 26:32.775
Uh, how much money
do I make?

26:34.755 --> 26:37.315
About 40 cents an hour.

26:39.995 --> 26:42.925
Yeah, it's not much,
but I don't need a lot.

26:42.965 --> 26:45.085
And I...
I save most of it.

26:46.895 --> 26:48.425
Let's eat. Shall we?

26:48.465 --> 26:51.595
Yes! Oh,
it looks delicious.

26:54.075 --> 26:57.335
So Noah, you and Allie have been
spending a lot of time together.

26:58.975 --> 27:01.415
You must be very fond
of each other.

27:03.245 --> 27:05.575
It's getting
pretty serious, huh?

27:05.615 --> 27:07.345
Yes, ma'am.

27:07.385 --> 27:11.615
Well, summer's almost gone.
What will you do?

27:11.655 --> 27:14.285
You know, Charleston's
only a couple of hours away.

27:16.465 --> 27:18.455
But Allie's going
to Sarah Lawrence.

27:20.365 --> 27:21.925
Didn't she tell you?

27:21.965 --> 27:24.095
No, she didn't
tell me that.

27:26.435 --> 27:28.665
I just got the letter.
I was going to tell you.

27:28.705 --> 27:29.735
It's okay.

27:31.375 --> 27:32.935
And Sarah Lawrence
is in New York.

27:37.485 --> 27:38.675
I didn't know that.

27:40.015 --> 27:43.455
Anne, this conversation's
too stuffy for the dinner table.

27:43.485 --> 27:46.825
Let the children have fun without
bringing in the Spanish Inquisition.

27:46.855 --> 27:49.015
My lips are buttoned,
right now.

27:49.055 --> 27:52.585
I do know another joke about the Nun
and the full standing bishop.

27:53.935 --> 27:54.925
- Stop
- That wasn't me.

27:54.965 --> 27:57.095
I'm leaving the table
if you tell another joke.

27:59.775 --> 28:01.135
Whoo!

28:01.175 --> 28:02.435
I'm gonna do it.

28:02.475 --> 28:04.465
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

28:10.185 --> 28:13.415
That child's got too much spirit for
a girl of her circumstance.

28:13.455 --> 28:16.475
Nah, it's just
summer love.

28:16.525 --> 28:18.115
Trouble
is what it is.

28:43.045 --> 28:44.775
Is that Allie
out there?

28:46.485 --> 28:49.285
Do you want
to go somewhere?

28:51.585 --> 28:52.615
Okay.

28:58.065 --> 28:59.355
Wait here.

29:20.015 --> 29:21.385
Allie!

29:23.325 --> 29:24.545
Come on.

29:28.755 --> 29:30.625
All right,
take a step.

29:30.665 --> 29:33.065
Step. No, don't...

29:34.635 --> 29:36.395
All right,
just stay there.

29:36.435 --> 29:38.595
Don't open
your eyes.

29:45.305 --> 29:47.175
Okay.

29:47.215 --> 29:49.445
The Windsor Plantation.

29:49.485 --> 29:52.005
It was built in 1772.

29:52.045 --> 29:54.345
Rumor has it that Francis Marion...

29:54.385 --> 29:57.515
Proposed to his wife right here under
these... uh, these steps.

29:58.685 --> 30:00.175
- Huh?
- Watch out.

30:00.225 --> 30:02.285
You be careful, these are broken.
Look at that.

30:02.325 --> 30:04.295
This...

30:04.325 --> 30:06.095
This place is gigantic.

30:06.135 --> 30:08.295
Yeah, a gigantic
piece of crap.

30:08.335 --> 30:10.805
It is.

30:10.835 --> 30:13.995
But I'm gonna buy it one day
and I'm gonna fix it up.

30:14.035 --> 30:15.805
All it needs
is a new floor.

30:16.975 --> 30:18.705
And new walls
and a roof.

30:18.745 --> 30:21.805
- Is that all?
- And plumbing and electric.

30:21.845 --> 30:24.315
- And furniture.
- Yes, and furniture.

30:24.345 --> 30:25.945
But it's right
on the water.

30:25.985 --> 30:27.785
And there's a big
old barn out there...

30:27.815 --> 30:29.975
I could turn that
into my workshop.

30:30.025 --> 30:32.115
Well, what about me?

30:32.155 --> 30:33.645
Now don't I get
any say in this?

30:35.995 --> 30:37.725
You want a say in this?

30:37.765 --> 30:40.555
Yes, I would.

30:40.595 --> 30:41.925
What do you want?

30:41.965 --> 30:43.225
I want
a white house...

30:43.265 --> 30:45.925
with blue shutters...

30:45.965 --> 30:48.635
And a room overlooking
the river so I can paint.

30:49.675 --> 30:51.165
- Anything else?
- Yes.

30:51.205 --> 30:55.115
I want a big old porch that
wraps around the entire house.

30:55.145 --> 30:56.845
We can drink tea...

30:56.885 --> 30:58.605
and watch
the sun go down.

31:00.485 --> 31:02.745
- Okay.
- You promise?

31:02.785 --> 31:05.255
Mm-hmm,
I promise.

31:05.285 --> 31:06.625
Good.

31:08.155 --> 31:10.425
- Where are you going?
- In here.

32:00.345 --> 32:03.835
I can't play chopsticks
if you're doing that.

32:22.735 --> 32:25.135
Oh, God.

32:25.165 --> 32:27.065
Oh, make love to me.

34:21.755 --> 34:22.915
- Noah.
- Yeah?

34:22.955 --> 34:25.514
Um...

34:25.554 --> 34:27.925
I know I said that I wanted you
to make love to me,

34:27.955 --> 34:29.155
- but I think you...
- Yeah?

34:29.195 --> 34:31.385
You're gonna have
to talk me through this.

34:33.594 --> 34:36.125
- Right. You all right?
- Yeah.

34:36.165 --> 34:37.895
- Did I hurt you?
- No, no.

34:37.935 --> 34:40.764
I'm just...
I'm just having a lot of thoughts.

34:40.804 --> 34:44.105
I'm just...
I'm just having a lot of...

34:44.145 --> 34:45.235
never mind.

34:51.685 --> 34:54.655
Like what are you thinking?
What are you thinking, right now?

34:54.685 --> 34:56.514
You know,
right this second?

34:58.625 --> 35:02.145
Did you know that this was going
to happen when you brought me here?

35:02.195 --> 35:03.425
- No.
- No?

35:03.465 --> 35:06.915
- No.
- No, you didn't think about it?

35:06.965 --> 35:09.265
- Of course I thought about it.
- You did?

35:09.295 --> 35:12.025
- Uh-huh.
- Well, what did you think?

35:12.065 --> 35:14.195
Uh, I'm talking
too much, aren't I?

35:14.235 --> 35:16.965
Okay, okay,
I'm just going to shut up.

35:17.005 --> 35:18.495
Mum's the word.

35:18.545 --> 35:20.975
Okay.

35:21.015 --> 35:23.985
- You all right?
- Yeah.

35:24.015 --> 35:26.415
- Uh-huh.
- All right.

35:26.455 --> 35:30.045
I just don't understand
how come you're so quiet.

35:30.085 --> 35:32.645
You don't have
one thought?

35:32.685 --> 35:34.085
I'm going crazy
over here,

35:34.125 --> 35:36.525
but no, with you,
everything's fine.

35:36.565 --> 35:38.465
You don't have
a care in the world?

35:46.435 --> 35:48.305
I'm sorry.

35:48.335 --> 35:51.065
I wanted this
to be so perfect.

35:51.105 --> 35:53.235
Now I can't shut up.

35:56.045 --> 35:57.515
I love you.

35:59.915 --> 36:01.575
Did you know that?

36:16.395 --> 36:17.885
I love you too.

36:26.445 --> 36:27.565
Yeah.

36:33.715 --> 36:37.385
You don't have to do this
if you don't want to.

36:37.425 --> 36:40.755
No, no, I want to,
I do.

36:41.795 --> 36:43.695
Noah!
Noah!

36:43.725 --> 36:46.385
What? Fin,
get out of here!

36:46.425 --> 36:48.825
Look, I'm sorry,
but Allie's parents are going crazy.

36:48.865 --> 36:50.765
They got every cop in town
out looking for her.

37:03.845 --> 37:06.375
- You sent the police for me?
- Yes.

37:06.415 --> 37:08.685
It is two in the morning.
We sent the police.

37:08.715 --> 37:11.915
Thank God you're all right.
Where you been?

37:11.955 --> 37:13.985
Mr. Hamilton,
all this is my fault.

37:14.025 --> 37:15.955
Would you give us
a moment please?

37:15.995 --> 37:18.895
I'd like to talk
to my daughter.

37:18.925 --> 37:20.695
Alone, young lady.

37:27.275 --> 37:29.635
Thanks for everything,
Lieutenant.

37:29.675 --> 37:31.765
You bet, John, anytime.

37:31.805 --> 37:34.295
You go straight home now,
it's late.

37:40.915 --> 37:42.545
Sir, it's really
not her fault.

37:42.585 --> 37:44.885
I lost track
of time.

37:45.885 --> 37:48.225
Sit down.

37:57.865 --> 37:59.455
I'm sorry, Daddy.

38:03.375 --> 38:06.275
- Is he a rapist?
- No.

38:11.715 --> 38:15.945
- Like what, mother?
- You are going to stop seeing Noah.

38:15.985 --> 38:18.755
She is out fooling around
with that boy till 2:00 in the morning

38:18.785 --> 38:21.085
and it has got
to stop.

38:21.125 --> 38:22.885
I didn't spend
17 years of my life

38:22.925 --> 38:26.195
raising a daughter
and giving her everything...

38:26.225 --> 38:28.065
so she could throw it away
on a summer romance.

38:28.095 --> 38:29.085
Daddy, come on!

38:29.135 --> 38:31.105
She will wind up with her
heart broken or pregnant.

38:31.135 --> 38:32.825
- Anne, please.
- Now, he is a nice boy.

38:32.865 --> 38:36.805
- He's a nice boy, but he's...
- He's what? He's what? Tell me.

38:36.845 --> 38:39.035
He is trash, trash, trash...
not for you.

38:39.075 --> 38:41.275
Trash?

38:50.685 --> 38:52.315
Don't touch me!

38:54.025 --> 38:56.785
Now that is enough. You are not to see
him anymore. And that's final.

38:56.825 --> 38:58.295
- No, it's not final.
- Yes it is.

38:58.325 --> 38:59.815
- No, it's not final!
- Allie!

38:59.865 --> 39:02.265
You're not going to tell me
who I'm gonna love.

39:02.295 --> 39:05.965
- Love?
- Yes Daddy, I love him.

39:06.005 --> 39:08.695
I love him.

39:08.735 --> 39:10.725
He's not suitable
for you, baby.

39:23.555 --> 39:25.385
I love him.

39:25.425 --> 39:27.855
You are 17 years old,
you don't know anything about love.

39:27.895 --> 39:29.855
Oh, and you do?

39:29.895 --> 39:32.155
You don't look at Daddy
the way I look at Noah.

39:32.195 --> 39:34.095
You don't touch
or laugh.

39:34.135 --> 39:37.295
You don't play.
You don't know anything about love.

39:38.305 --> 39:40.235
Noah?

39:40.275 --> 39:41.735
Noah?

39:44.075 --> 39:46.405
Hey, hey.

39:46.445 --> 39:48.105
You leaving?

39:50.345 --> 39:53.185
Oh my God,
I'm so sorry.

39:53.215 --> 39:56.705
I don't even know what to say.
I'm humiliated.

39:56.755 --> 39:58.815
- It's all right.
- No, it's not.

39:58.855 --> 40:00.945
- Yeah.
- No, it's not.

40:08.295 --> 40:10.695
No.

40:16.275 --> 40:18.575
- I'm gonna go.
- No, I don't want you to go.

40:18.605 --> 40:20.805
I got to think
about some stuff.

40:20.845 --> 40:23.335
What do you
got to think about, huh?

40:23.385 --> 40:25.285
Come here
and talk to me.

40:25.315 --> 40:26.875
Talk to me!

40:26.915 --> 40:28.885
About what?
You want...

40:28.915 --> 40:30.685
you're going away!

40:32.325 --> 40:34.485
You're leaving.

40:34.525 --> 40:37.155
And I'm staying here.

40:37.195 --> 40:39.855
And I'm so happy
that you're doing it,

40:39.895 --> 40:42.295
but you're gonna have
a million things to do.

40:42.335 --> 40:44.025
- No.
- You got so much ahead of you.

40:44.065 --> 40:46.005
- Don't talk like that.
- It's true.

40:46.035 --> 40:49.865
I'm not going to have
nice things, fancy things.

40:49.905 --> 40:52.395
It doesn't...

40:52.445 --> 40:54.965
It's never gonna happen for me.
It's not in the cards for me.

40:55.015 --> 40:56.845
I don't have
to go to school, okay?

40:56.885 --> 40:58.505
- Yes, you do.
- I can stay here.

40:58.545 --> 41:01.015
No. Do you see, that's exactly
what I am talking about.

41:01.055 --> 41:02.385
Then you can
come with me.

41:03.685 --> 41:05.845
- To New York?
- Yes.

41:07.725 --> 41:09.485
What am I going
to do in New York?

41:11.995 --> 41:13.465
Be with me?

41:18.565 --> 41:20.265
Yeah.

41:23.035 --> 41:24.665
I don't know.

41:29.475 --> 41:32.035
We don't got to figure all this
out tonight, ya know?

41:32.085 --> 41:34.645
We'll finish out the summer and we'll
see what happens.

41:35.985 --> 41:37.815
You saying you want
to break it off?

41:37.855 --> 41:40.725
What I'm saying we see how it goes
later on.

41:47.135 --> 41:49.655
Are you breaking up
with me?

41:52.305 --> 41:54.235
I don't see
how it's gonna work.

41:56.875 --> 41:58.205
I see...

41:59.775 --> 42:02.145
Please don't do this.

42:02.175 --> 42:03.645
You don't mean it.

42:04.985 --> 42:07.275
Oh hell, well if you're
going to do it,

42:07.315 --> 42:09.345
why wait until
the summer ends, huh?

42:09.385 --> 42:11.615
Why don't you
just do it, right now?

42:13.385 --> 42:14.655
Come on.

42:14.695 --> 42:16.025
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

42:16.055 --> 42:18.115
Do it!
Do it!

42:18.165 --> 42:19.825
Do it right now.

42:19.865 --> 42:22.595
Do it!

42:22.635 --> 42:23.755
Stop it!

42:23.805 --> 42:25.025
Oh!

42:25.065 --> 42:27.765
You know what? I'm gonna do it.
It's over.

42:27.805 --> 42:29.775
Okay? It's over.

42:29.805 --> 42:32.295
- Come here.
- Don't touch me.

42:32.345 --> 42:34.335
I hate you,
I hate you.

42:34.375 --> 42:35.635
I'm gonna go.

42:35.675 --> 42:38.165
Why don't you, why don't you
just go. Get out.

42:38.215 --> 42:41.915
Leave!
Go! Go!

42:43.725 --> 42:46.415
No, no, just wait a minute. We're not
really breaking up, are we?

42:46.455 --> 42:47.515
Come on.

42:47.555 --> 42:49.085
This is just a fight
we're having,

42:49.125 --> 42:52.185
and tomorrow it will be
like it never happened, right?

42:57.805 --> 43:00.365
- Going?
- Gone.

43:00.405 --> 43:02.205
Well, she must have
been devastated.

43:02.235 --> 43:03.565
She was.

43:03.605 --> 43:05.475
He was only trying
to do the right thing.

43:05.505 --> 43:06.995
Yeah.

43:07.045 --> 43:08.845
But what he really should have done

43:08.875 --> 43:10.675
is just told those parents
to go to hell.

43:10.715 --> 43:12.545
Just stick it
where the sun don't shine.

43:12.585 --> 43:15.675
Yeah, you're right,
probably should have.

43:17.325 --> 43:19.615
The next day,
Allie woke up

43:19.655 --> 43:22.185
to find her world
completely changed.

43:29.565 --> 43:31.505
What's going on?

43:31.535 --> 43:33.295
We're going home.

43:34.405 --> 43:35.895
We're going now?

43:35.935 --> 43:38.405
No, we're not supposed to be leaving
for another week.

43:38.445 --> 43:41.135
Get dressed and then come and have
some breakfast, dear.

43:41.175 --> 43:42.665
Willow will pack
your things.

43:42.715 --> 43:44.775
Why, I'd be happy to pack your things,
Miss Allie.

43:44.815 --> 43:46.115
I don't want
you to pack my things.

43:46.145 --> 43:48.275
I don't want you to touch my stuff.
I'm not going.

43:48.315 --> 43:49.785
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

43:49.815 --> 43:51.985
- Yes, Allie, you are.
- No, I'm not.

43:52.025 --> 43:54.685
Allie, you are going whether
you like it or not.

43:54.725 --> 43:57.455
Now, even if Aaron
has to throw you over his shoulder

43:57.495 --> 44:01.225
and drag you the whole way,
you're going.

44:05.505 --> 44:06.665
Excuse me.

44:06.705 --> 44:07.965
- All right, let's go.
- Come on.

44:08.005 --> 44:09.695
We have to have all these
done by lunch.

44:09.735 --> 44:10.725
Come on, get on!

44:10.775 --> 44:12.365
You shouldn't be standing around.
Here we go.

44:12.405 --> 44:13.395
Let's go.
Come on.

44:13.445 --> 44:15.375
Fin!

44:19.945 --> 44:21.075
Where's Noah?

44:21.115 --> 44:22.845
He's out
delivering a load.

44:22.885 --> 44:26.655
- What's going on?
- I'm leaving town.

44:26.685 --> 44:28.245
- Leaving?
- Yeah.

44:28.295 --> 44:30.785
- When?
- Now, right now... like today.

44:32.965 --> 44:34.895
Look, I need you to tell Noah
something, okay?

44:34.935 --> 44:36.665
I need you
to tell him that I love him.

44:36.695 --> 44:39.225
And tell him
that I'm sorry for everything, okay?

44:40.735 --> 44:43.865
Look, I was up all night
with him, Allie.

44:43.905 --> 44:45.435
I've never seen him
so low.

44:45.475 --> 44:48.675
It's over. Don't make it any harder
than it already is.

44:48.715 --> 44:50.575
No! No, it's not over.

44:50.615 --> 44:52.415
Fin, we had a fight
last night.

44:52.445 --> 44:55.045
No, we said some things we didn't mean,
but it's not over.

44:55.085 --> 44:56.485
- It is over.
- No.

44:56.515 --> 44:58.145
Leave it alone.
Let it go.

44:58.185 --> 45:00.555
I'm coming.

45:00.595 --> 45:02.785
Mama, I'm coming!

45:05.195 --> 45:08.655
- Look, he understands.
- But...

45:08.695 --> 45:11.065
It's hard,
but he really does.

45:11.105 --> 45:13.895
Summer's over
and it's time to go home.

45:13.935 --> 45:16.265
If he wants to talk to you,
he'll write. If not?

45:21.815 --> 45:23.975
Okay.

45:24.015 --> 45:27.315
Okay, can you just... can you just
tell him that I love him, then?

45:27.355 --> 45:30.375
- Can you do that?
- I'll tell him.

45:31.685 --> 45:33.245
Thank you.

45:35.525 --> 45:37.115
Bye, Fin.

46:19.165 --> 46:20.535
She's gone.

46:35.555 --> 46:38.785
Summer romances end
for all kinds of reasons.

46:39.985 --> 46:41.985
But when all
is said and done,

46:42.025 --> 46:43.855
they have
one thing in common:

46:43.895 --> 46:46.915
They are shooting stars...

46:46.965 --> 46:50.025
a spectacular moment
of light in the heavens,

46:50.065 --> 46:51.795
a fleeting glimpse
of eternity.

46:51.835 --> 46:56.065
And in a flash,
they're gone.

46:57.705 --> 46:59.405
Noah was desperate.

46:59.445 --> 47:01.605
He wrote to Allie
that he was sorry and stupid

47:01.645 --> 47:03.575
for breaking up
with her.

47:03.615 --> 47:07.375
He wrote to tell her that he still loved
her, and he wanted to see her.

47:07.415 --> 47:11.515
And that if she would write back,
he would come to wherever she was.

47:14.425 --> 47:17.255
He wrote one letter
a day for a year...

47:17.295 --> 47:19.725
365 letters,

47:19.765 --> 47:21.495
but they all
went unanswered.

47:21.535 --> 47:24.295
Hey Fred!
Nothing?

47:24.335 --> 47:25.635
Sorry.

47:25.665 --> 47:28.395
All right,
thank you.

47:28.435 --> 47:30.425
Finally, after a year
of silence,

47:30.475 --> 47:34.605
he decided to put it all behind him
and start a new life.

47:34.645 --> 47:36.575
So he wrote
a farewell letter

47:36.615 --> 47:39.205
And he and Fin
packed their bags

47:39.245 --> 47:41.075
and headed for Atlanta.

47:41.115 --> 47:43.015
Noah! Noah!

47:43.055 --> 47:44.915
Noah!

47:46.025 --> 47:47.815
Come on,
listen to this!

47:47.855 --> 47:53.625
A state of war has existed

47:53.665 --> 47:56.595
between
the United States and the...

47:56.635 --> 47:58.395
The Constitution
of the United States,

47:58.435 --> 48:01.765
against all enemies,
foreign and domestic.

48:01.805 --> 48:04.835
Noah and Fin
enlisted together.

48:04.875 --> 48:06.865
And after two years
of chasing Rommel

48:06.905 --> 48:08.705
through
the North African desert,

48:08.745 --> 48:12.305
they were deployed
to Patton's Third Army in Europe.

48:21.795 --> 48:22.915
Go!

48:28.335 --> 48:29.795
Fin!

48:53.925 --> 48:55.855
Do I contradict myself?

48:55.895 --> 48:58.055
Very well then,
I contradict myself.

48:58.095 --> 49:00.285
Allie was in her
third year of college

49:00.325 --> 49:03.385
when she volunteered
as a nurse's aid.

49:03.435 --> 49:06.195
To her, the broken men
with shattered bodies,

49:06.235 --> 49:09.295
who filled the ward
were all Noah.

49:09.335 --> 49:12.365
Or someone who fought
beside him in the jungle

49:12.405 --> 49:15.175
or frozen
snow swept road.

49:15.215 --> 49:16.615
I'm gonna lift you up.

49:16.645 --> 49:18.175
Ready?

49:18.215 --> 49:21.415
There we go.

49:21.455 --> 49:24.855
Now, I'm gonna bring
this leg over.

49:24.885 --> 49:26.045
- Set it on the stool.
- All right.

49:26.085 --> 49:28.685
- You okay?
- Yeah.

49:28.725 --> 49:32.055
Miss, can I
ask you a question?

49:34.095 --> 49:35.925
I noticed that you
aren't wearing a ring.

49:35.965 --> 49:40.295
And I was wondering
if I could take you out.

49:41.805 --> 49:44.205
- Excuse me?
- On a date.

49:47.245 --> 49:50.115
Now, before you go
and say no,

49:50.145 --> 49:53.585
I'll have you know that
I am an excellent dancer

49:53.615 --> 49:56.605
and my intentions
are completely dishonorable.

50:01.155 --> 50:04.455
Okay, okay
"Casanova," come on.

50:04.495 --> 50:06.585
Let's just
get you better,

50:06.625 --> 50:08.855
then we'll talk
about a date, okay?

50:18.605 --> 50:20.595
Would you get
a load of him?

50:23.375 --> 50:25.935
Oh my gosh,
he is dreamy.

50:26.945 --> 50:29.005
What is he doing here?

50:29.055 --> 50:30.455
He's staring at you.

50:30.485 --> 50:31.885
Oh, miss?

50:34.155 --> 50:36.095
I'm all better.

50:37.195 --> 50:39.825
Now, how's
about that date?

50:39.865 --> 50:41.955
Allie was surprised
how quickly

50:41.995 --> 50:44.335
she fell in love
with Lon Hammond.

50:49.135 --> 50:50.765
He was handsome, smart,

50:50.805 --> 50:53.635
funny, sophisticated
and charming.

50:53.675 --> 50:55.765
Hey!

51:02.285 --> 51:04.775
He also came from
old Southern money,

51:04.825 --> 51:06.615
and was
fabulously wealthy.

51:11.365 --> 51:14.765
What?

51:18.735 --> 51:19.725
# Hya! #

51:21.905 --> 51:23.425
Oh, what's happening?

51:23.475 --> 51:24.965
- Where you going?
- Where they going?

51:25.005 --> 51:27.635
- See you later, sweetheart.
- Oh dear, look at that.

51:30.175 --> 51:32.905
Allie, I've been thinking a lot about
why we shouldn't get married.

51:32.945 --> 51:35.575
Okay, I give up,
why shouldn't we get married?

51:35.615 --> 51:38.105
Well see, that's the thing,
I couldn't think of anything at first.

51:38.155 --> 51:40.955
An then, it just dawned on me.
Your parents...

51:40.995 --> 51:42.825
- My parents?
- Absolutely.

51:42.855 --> 51:44.795
- Your old mom and dad.
Thank you for that.

51:44.825 --> 51:46.155
Mom?

51:46.195 --> 51:47.755
You see, the problem is
that they love me.

51:47.795 --> 51:49.355
- I'm exactly the type of man
- They do.

51:49.395 --> 51:51.125
- They want you to end up with.
- Really?

51:51.165 --> 51:54.725
You know, I'm wealthy,
I'm from the South, I got a decent job.

51:54.775 --> 51:58.065
You know, I'm an incredible dancer,
I'm a really smart guy.

51:58.105 --> 52:00.575
You look great.

52:00.605 --> 52:03.075
- I like to think...
- So what's the problem, huh?

52:03.115 --> 52:05.605
Now just this, if you marry me...

52:05.645 --> 52:07.305
Now listen close.

52:07.345 --> 52:09.115
If you marry me...

52:09.155 --> 52:12.455
Then you will have lost a life long
battle of defiance against them.

52:12.485 --> 52:14.185
Oh my goodness,
what are we going to do?

52:14.225 --> 52:15.455
I do not know.

52:15.495 --> 52:18.425
Hey, band,
you feeling all right?

52:18.465 --> 52:20.655
# Hey, band,
you feeling all right?! #

52:20.695 --> 52:22.665
# Ooh bop sha bam,
shi bimmy bop #

52:22.695 --> 52:25.135
- # Oh bop sha bam, shi bimmy bop #
- You say it!

52:25.165 --> 52:27.635
- # Ally ally ally ooh #
- # Ally ally ally ooh #

52:27.675 --> 52:29.605
- # Olly olly olly ooh #
- # Olly olly olly ooh #

52:29.635 --> 52:31.035
- # Whooly ooh #
- # Whooly ooh #

52:31.075 --> 52:33.475
- # Whooly ooh #
- # Whooly ooh #

52:35.375 --> 52:38.675
See Allie, I think...
damn it, I think you have to marry me.

52:38.715 --> 52:40.775
- I think you need to marry me.
- I do?

52:40.815 --> 52:42.015
- Yes you do.
- I do, why?

52:42.055 --> 52:44.315
Because if you do,
you parents will always know

52:44.355 --> 52:47.945
the unhappiness that you feel for
not being able to disappoint them.

52:47.995 --> 52:50.785
I think you may
have overlooked one minor detail.

52:50.825 --> 52:51.985
And what's that?

52:52.025 --> 52:54.865
Well, you see you have to
get their permission first.

52:54.895 --> 52:57.795
And I think you may have overestimated
their affection for you.

52:57.835 --> 52:59.305
Is that right?

52:59.335 --> 53:01.825
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, I don't think so.

53:01.875 --> 53:02.865
Then why not?

53:02.905 --> 53:05.305
Oh, 'cause I asked them
already and they said yes.

53:05.345 --> 53:07.135
What?

53:10.715 --> 53:12.345
One more thing.

53:14.015 --> 53:16.005
I love you.

53:16.055 --> 53:18.315
Will you marry me, honey?

53:18.355 --> 53:21.325
I know I kid around a lot,
but I'm crazy about you.

53:23.125 --> 53:26.215
Marry me? Make me
the happiest man in the world.

53:28.965 --> 53:31.055
Yes. Yes!

53:35.305 --> 53:38.705
- Just hold tight.
- Where are you going?

53:38.745 --> 53:41.605
Oh my God. Mama.

53:41.645 --> 53:43.505
Okay, stop the band.

53:43.545 --> 53:45.375
Excuse me. I'd like
everyone here to know

53:45.415 --> 53:47.345
that this young lady
and I are getting married.

53:55.095 --> 53:57.955
She agreed with all her heart,
but couldn't understand

53:57.995 --> 54:01.155
why at the very moment
she said yes,

54:01.195 --> 54:04.225
Noah's face
came to her mind.

54:14.515 --> 54:17.135
Hey, Noah, yeah!

54:17.175 --> 54:19.875
Oh, good to see you.
Let me see you.

54:19.915 --> 54:21.645
You bleeding anywhere?
No?

54:21.685 --> 54:23.155
- Everything good?
- Yeah.

54:23.185 --> 54:24.745
Oh, I love you.

54:24.785 --> 54:27.655
Come on, there's something
I got to show you.

54:27.695 --> 54:29.125
- Come on.
- All right.

54:33.765 --> 54:35.455
What's going on?

54:35.495 --> 54:36.755
What is this?

54:36.795 --> 54:38.465
Here.

54:38.505 --> 54:39.995
I sold the house.

54:41.435 --> 54:43.465
- You sold the house?
- Yup.

54:43.505 --> 54:45.335
Gotta be out
by the end of the month.

54:45.375 --> 54:48.105
Between that and your GI Bill,
you ought to be able to get it now.

54:49.315 --> 54:51.245
- Get what?
- Your dream house.

54:51.285 --> 54:52.645
- The Windsor Plantation.
- Dad...

54:52.685 --> 54:54.805
Now, don't Dad me,
I don't want to hear about it.

54:54.855 --> 54:58.415
I already talked to the bank,
they're gonna give you the loan.

54:58.455 --> 55:02.285
- Well, I can't let you sell your house.
- It's done.

55:02.325 --> 55:05.815
It's a good thing.
You should do it.

55:11.435 --> 55:14.425
Wait a second. You sell the house,
where are you gonna live?

55:14.475 --> 55:16.025
With you, dummy,
what do you think?

55:16.075 --> 55:18.405
Somebody's got
to help you fix it up.

55:27.145 --> 55:29.245
Noah took a look
at the house,

55:29.285 --> 55:31.775
but only saw
one thing...

55:31.825 --> 55:34.115
Allie.

55:34.155 --> 55:37.485
He decided right there
to fulfill his life-long dream.

55:37.525 --> 55:42.125
He would rebuild the old house
from the ground up.

55:44.065 --> 55:49.125
And when Noah went to Charleston
to get the building plans approved,

55:49.175 --> 55:53.075
fate stepped in
and dealt him a sweet card.

56:00.045 --> 56:02.955
Stop the bus!
Stop the bus.

56:02.985 --> 56:05.215
Sorry, Mac, I can't stop the bus
until I get to the depot.

56:05.255 --> 56:07.385
No, no, no, please stop
the bus now. Please!

56:07.425 --> 56:08.985
Do you understand
English, pal?

56:09.025 --> 56:12.325
No one gets off till we get
to the depot. Now sit down.

56:12.365 --> 56:14.885
- God.
- Hey!

56:19.465 --> 56:20.995
Watch it, screwball!

56:21.035 --> 56:22.765
What are you doing?

56:22.805 --> 56:24.675
Hey!

56:24.705 --> 56:26.335
How old is your daughter now?

56:26.375 --> 56:28.635
- Well, you mind.
- He's right over there.

56:47.295 --> 56:49.095
Baby, hello.

56:58.775 --> 57:00.265
- Oh!
- Hold it.

57:05.845 --> 57:07.815
Oh, come with it.

57:13.885 --> 57:15.725
After seeing Allie that day,

57:15.755 --> 57:19.215
something inside
Noah snapped.

57:19.265 --> 57:20.855
He got the notion
into his head

57:20.895 --> 57:22.455
that if he restored
the old house

57:22.495 --> 57:24.835
where they had
come that night,

57:24.865 --> 57:28.465
Allie would find a way
to come back to him.

57:28.505 --> 57:30.735
Some called it
a labor of love.

57:30.775 --> 57:33.035
Others called it
something else.

57:33.075 --> 57:37.235
But in fact,
Noah had gone a little mad.

57:37.275 --> 57:38.945
- Excuse me.
- Would...

57:39.945 --> 57:41.605
It's time to eat.

57:41.655 --> 57:43.615
Lunch will be served
in the Sun Room today.

57:46.325 --> 57:50.155
The melon is good.
I had a bite.

57:50.195 --> 57:52.685
Did they ever
see each other again?

57:52.725 --> 57:54.995
Noah and Allie?

57:55.035 --> 57:57.495
Now you don't want
me to spoil the end of the story

57:57.535 --> 58:00.505
before I get
to the good part, do you?

58:00.535 --> 58:02.765
Where did I leave off?

58:02.805 --> 58:04.465
I shall not want.

58:04.505 --> 58:06.835
When Noah's father
died in November,

58:06.875 --> 58:08.605
the house
was all he had.

58:08.645 --> 58:10.875
He leadeth me down...

58:28.865 --> 58:31.855
In time, Noah
finished the house.

58:31.905 --> 58:33.895
Okay, smile.
Here we go.

58:36.075 --> 58:38.735
He took a good look
at what he had accomplished,

58:38.775 --> 58:41.745
got rip-roaring drunk
for 10 days,

58:41.775 --> 58:45.075
thought seriously
about setting it on fire,

58:45.115 --> 58:47.245
then finally
put the house up for sale.

58:47.285 --> 58:49.075
I'm prepared
to offer you this much.

58:51.085 --> 58:52.955
He had a number
of interested buyers,

58:52.985 --> 58:55.855
but he always found a reason
not to sell it to them.

58:55.895 --> 58:57.385
No.

58:57.425 --> 58:59.455
Either the bids
were too low,

58:59.495 --> 59:01.795
or if they met
his asking price,

59:01.835 --> 59:04.425
he felt it was worth
a lot more.

59:04.465 --> 59:07.235
It's a lot of money,
but I'll take it.

59:10.175 --> 59:12.005
$50,000.

59:12.045 --> 59:14.975
- That's more than my asking price.
- That's right.

59:15.015 --> 59:16.405
It's a great deal more.

59:21.185 --> 59:24.775
He told the man that offered him
$5,000 over his price

59:24.825 --> 59:27.785
that no one in his right mind
would do that

59:27.825 --> 59:30.585
and he wouldn't have
a lunatic living in his house.

59:32.825 --> 59:36.825
He worked out his frustration with life
on the creek every morning.

59:38.465 --> 59:42.165
And in the evenings,
to temper the sting of loneliness,

59:42.205 --> 59:44.725
there was Martha Shaw.

59:44.775 --> 59:46.535
Martha was a war widow

59:46.575 --> 59:49.235
who lived in Quail Ridge,
a town away.

59:53.485 --> 59:56.215
So you want to go out
tomorrow?

59:56.255 --> 59:57.945
I got to work.

59:57.985 --> 59:59.955
Well, we could
down to the river if you want to.

59:59.985 --> 01:00:01.755
Next week, sometime.

01:00:01.795 --> 01:00:03.455
Maybe we could
take a drive somewhere?

01:00:03.495 --> 01:00:05.395
No.

01:00:05.425 --> 01:00:07.585
Well,
I'm just asking you.

01:00:19.375 --> 01:00:21.535
What do you want, Noah?

01:00:24.445 --> 01:00:26.175
What do you mean,
what do I want?

01:00:28.885 --> 01:00:30.685
From me.

01:00:35.795 --> 01:00:38.415
Sometimes when you talk to me,
you don't even see me.

01:00:43.495 --> 01:00:46.025
Look, a woman knows
when a man looks into her eyes

01:00:46.065 --> 01:00:47.935
and sees someone else.

01:00:54.745 --> 01:00:57.435
Now you know I want to give you
all the things that you want,

01:00:59.345 --> 01:01:01.715
right?

01:01:04.925 --> 01:01:06.545
But I can't,

01:01:06.585 --> 01:01:09.455
because they're gone...

01:01:12.625 --> 01:01:14.255
they're broken.

01:01:17.335 --> 01:01:19.195
All right?

01:01:42.395 --> 01:01:44.015
Is the veil too much?

01:01:44.055 --> 01:01:46.115
Are you kidding?
You look perfect!

01:01:46.165 --> 01:01:49.065
You're the most
beautiful bride.

01:01:50.635 --> 01:01:53.195
- You look gorgeous, honey.
- Thank you.

01:01:53.235 --> 01:01:57.195
Wait until Lon sees you in this dress,
he's gonna go crazy.

01:01:57.235 --> 01:01:59.965
He won't be able
to take his eyes off you,

01:02:00.005 --> 01:02:01.205
or his hands.

01:02:01.245 --> 01:02:02.905
Oh, you're bad!

01:02:02.945 --> 01:02:04.535
Have you seen
this morning's paper?

01:02:04.575 --> 01:02:06.635
The "Daily Journal" says
that you are going to be

01:02:06.685 --> 01:02:09.915
- the social highlight of the season.
- Of the season?

01:02:09.955 --> 01:02:12.745
This is gonna be a celebration the likes
of which this town's never seen!

01:02:14.085 --> 01:02:15.955
She doesn't plan,
she plots, doesn't she?

01:02:18.295 --> 01:02:21.125
- Mama, look, the Governor's coming.
- He better. Let me see.

01:02:25.205 --> 01:02:26.495
Oh, boy.

01:02:53.595 --> 01:02:55.685
- All right Savannah, where are we at?
- We're 82 now.

01:03:04.475 --> 01:03:06.375
- Memphis, where are at?
- We're 89 now.

01:03:06.405 --> 01:03:07.535
89, great,
up from 85.

01:03:07.575 --> 01:03:08.705
- Sir?
- Yes.

01:03:08.745 --> 01:03:10.175
You have a visitor.

01:03:11.485 --> 01:03:14.105
Well, hello.
Baby, I didn't know you were coming.

01:03:14.145 --> 01:03:17.315
I'm... I'm so sorry,
I should have called.

01:03:17.355 --> 01:03:20.375
Baby, what are you talking about?
You don't have to call.

01:03:20.425 --> 01:03:22.585
- Guys, could you give us a minute?
- All right.

01:03:22.625 --> 01:03:24.645
Yes, sir.
Miss Allie.

01:03:24.695 --> 01:03:25.855
Ma'am.

01:03:31.735 --> 01:03:34.065
So what's up?

01:03:36.235 --> 01:03:37.505
I don't paint anymore.

01:03:38.875 --> 01:03:41.775
I used to paint
all the time.

01:03:41.815 --> 01:03:43.145
I really loved it.

01:03:43.175 --> 01:03:45.975
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah.

01:03:48.385 --> 01:03:49.715
So paint.

01:03:49.755 --> 01:03:51.715
I will.

01:03:53.025 --> 01:03:56.685
- I'm gonna start.
- Great.

01:04:02.665 --> 01:04:04.425
Is everything okay?

01:04:07.165 --> 01:04:08.655
I need to get away.

01:04:09.905 --> 01:04:11.035
Okay.

01:04:11.075 --> 01:04:14.135
I need to take care
of a few things.

01:04:14.175 --> 01:04:16.165
I need to clear
my head.

01:04:16.215 --> 01:04:18.545
Okay,
should I be worried?

01:04:18.585 --> 01:04:21.945
- No, I don't think so.
- Oh, that's reassuring.

01:04:23.415 --> 01:04:25.755
Listen, are you
all right?

01:04:26.755 --> 01:04:29.455
- Yeah.
- Okay, then go.

01:04:29.495 --> 01:04:31.585
Take your time,
do whatever you need to do.

01:04:31.625 --> 01:04:33.825
It's okay to be nervous,
all right?

01:04:33.865 --> 01:04:36.055
It's normal to get
cold feet before your wedding.

01:04:36.095 --> 01:04:38.225
No, no second
thoughts.

01:04:42.775 --> 01:04:45.005
I love you.

01:04:45.045 --> 01:04:47.775
I'm going to be back from Seabrook
in a couple of days, okay?

01:04:48.875 --> 01:04:52.575
- Seabrook?
- Yeah, Seabrook.

01:05:38.925 --> 01:05:39.915
Hello.

01:05:44.595 --> 01:05:47.535
I saw your picture
in the paper,

01:05:47.565 --> 01:05:49.365
the one with you
and the house.

01:05:49.405 --> 01:05:52.275
And I just wanted to come
and see if you were okay.

01:05:52.305 --> 01:05:54.465
I mean, I wasn't
in the neighborhood or anything.

01:05:54.505 --> 01:05:55.495
I just...

01:06:03.315 --> 01:06:04.715
So are you okay?

01:06:09.255 --> 01:06:11.125
Okay, good.

01:06:15.565 --> 01:06:17.965
I'm a stupid woman,
I shouldn't have come.

01:06:39.585 --> 01:06:41.315
You want to come in?

01:06:41.355 --> 01:06:43.155
Okay.

01:06:45.895 --> 01:06:47.955
This is a good story.

01:06:47.995 --> 01:06:50.085
I'm glad you like it.

01:06:51.465 --> 01:06:53.195
I think
I've heard it before.

01:06:55.275 --> 01:06:56.325
Yes.

01:06:57.605 --> 01:07:00.365
Perhaps more than once?

01:07:00.405 --> 01:07:01.875
Doctor needs
to see you.

01:07:01.915 --> 01:07:04.145
- Me? Now?
- No, him.

01:07:04.175 --> 01:07:06.645
But he hasn't finished
reading his story.

01:07:06.685 --> 01:07:09.085
I'll read some more
when I'm through with the doctor.

01:07:09.115 --> 01:07:11.145
This shouldn't take
too long.

01:07:11.185 --> 01:07:12.915
- All right.
- Don't you go away.

01:07:12.955 --> 01:07:15.855
I'll be right back.

01:07:15.895 --> 01:07:19.015
While you waiting, maybe you'd like
to play the piano for a few minutes.

01:07:19.065 --> 01:07:20.045
You do like that.

01:07:20.095 --> 01:07:22.255
I do?

01:07:22.295 --> 01:07:25.695
- I don't know any tunes.
- You can read music.

01:07:25.735 --> 01:07:28.935
No kidding?

01:07:33.245 --> 01:07:34.765
Who are you?

01:07:34.805 --> 01:07:38.075
I'm Dr. Barnwell,
one of the new attending physicians.

01:07:38.115 --> 01:07:40.545
We haven't met,
so I thought I'd examine you myself.

01:07:43.585 --> 01:07:45.485
Okay, so I see here

01:07:45.525 --> 01:07:48.755
that you've had two heart attacks
over the last 18 months.

01:07:48.795 --> 01:07:51.085
Yeah, minor ones,
I think one was angina.

01:07:51.125 --> 01:07:54.095
- Okay, any complications?
- Nope, feel fine.

01:07:54.125 --> 01:07:56.625
Okay, deep breath
for me.

01:07:56.665 --> 01:07:59.655
Okay, one more time.

01:08:00.835 --> 01:08:03.395
And deep breath.

01:08:03.435 --> 01:08:06.805
And one more.

01:08:06.845 --> 01:08:09.815
Terrific, terrific.
You still taking your medication?

01:08:09.845 --> 01:08:12.745
- Every day, twice a day.
- Good, good, good, good, good.

01:08:12.785 --> 01:08:15.215
Okay, you can
put your shirt on.

01:08:20.354 --> 01:08:22.944
So I understand that you
read to Miss Hamilton.

01:08:22.995 --> 01:08:25.555
Yeah, to help
her remember.

01:08:25.595 --> 01:08:27.895
- Hmm.
- You don't think it'll help?

01:08:27.925 --> 01:08:29.825
No, I don't.

01:08:29.865 --> 01:08:32.335
She remembers, Doc.

01:08:32.365 --> 01:08:35.635
I read to her
and she remembers.

01:08:35.675 --> 01:08:38.265
Not always,
but she remembers.

01:08:38.305 --> 01:08:40.435
But senile dementia
is irreversible.

01:08:40.475 --> 01:08:42.205
It's degenerative.

01:08:42.245 --> 01:08:45.265
After a certain point,
its victims don't come back.

01:08:45.314 --> 01:08:47.175
Yeah, that's what
they keep telling me.

01:08:47.215 --> 01:08:49.245
Well, I just don't want
you to get your hopes up.

01:08:49.285 --> 01:08:53.115
Well, thanks, Doc,
but you know what they say?

01:08:53.154 --> 01:08:56.745
Science goes only so far
and then comes God.

01:08:56.795 --> 01:08:58.484
Then comes God.

01:09:00.865 --> 01:09:03.955
Damn, I forgot to turn the page for her.
You through with me?

01:09:23.354 --> 01:09:25.975
I guess they flipped
that page.

01:09:26.024 --> 01:09:29.354
No, that she's playing
by memory.

01:09:31.895 --> 01:09:34.055
His name
is Lon Hammond, Jr.

01:09:34.095 --> 01:09:36.825
Hammond?
As in Hammond Cotton?

01:09:36.865 --> 01:09:38.385
As in Hammond Cotton.

01:09:38.435 --> 01:09:40.835
Well, your parents
must love him.

01:09:40.865 --> 01:09:45.604
He's a really good man, Noah.
You'd really like him.

01:09:45.645 --> 01:09:47.575
You love him?

01:09:48.845 --> 01:09:52.835
Yeah, I do.
I love him very much.

01:10:00.085 --> 01:10:01.715
Well, that's that.

01:10:01.755 --> 01:10:05.285
You marry Lon
and we can be friends...

01:10:06.995 --> 01:10:08.425
right?

01:10:08.465 --> 01:10:10.225
Right.

01:10:15.775 --> 01:10:17.535
Are you hungry?

01:10:17.575 --> 01:10:19.665
Do you want to stay
for dinner?

01:10:21.445 --> 01:10:22.605
Umm...

01:10:31.885 --> 01:10:33.785
I have to warn you,
I'm a cheap drunk.

01:10:33.825 --> 01:10:37.455
A couple more of these and you're gonna
be carrying me right out of here.

01:10:37.495 --> 01:10:40.425
Well, you go slow then, I don't want
to have to take advantage of you.

01:10:40.465 --> 01:10:42.955
You wouldn't dare.
I'm a married woman.

01:10:42.995 --> 01:10:44.725
Not yet.

01:10:51.405 --> 01:10:52.835
What?

01:10:55.715 --> 01:10:57.405
Why are you
looking at me like that?

01:11:00.545 --> 01:11:02.515
Just memories.

01:11:06.855 --> 01:11:09.445
This room.

01:11:12.065 --> 01:11:14.585
This...
is this where we...

01:11:15.835 --> 01:11:17.735
This is the room?

01:11:33.185 --> 01:11:35.675
- I'm full.
- Me too.

01:11:39.325 --> 01:11:41.585
"Oh how your fingers
drowse me.

01:11:41.625 --> 01:11:44.095
Your breath falls
around me like dew.

01:11:44.125 --> 01:11:47.285
Your pulse lulls
the tympans of my ears.

01:11:47.325 --> 01:11:49.815
I feel a merge
from head to foot.

01:11:49.865 --> 01:11:51.765
Delicious enough."

01:11:53.605 --> 01:11:55.465
It was real, wasn't it?

01:11:56.835 --> 01:12:00.065
You and me.

01:12:00.105 --> 01:12:03.605
Such a long time ago,
we were just a couple of kids.

01:12:07.415 --> 01:12:10.445
But we really loved
each other, didn't we?

01:12:18.665 --> 01:12:19.925
I should go.

01:12:23.665 --> 01:12:25.365
Goodbye.

01:12:27.265 --> 01:12:29.395
Do you think
you could back tomorrow morning?

01:12:29.435 --> 01:12:31.405
There's some place
I'd like to show you.

01:12:34.305 --> 01:12:35.795
Please.

01:12:37.645 --> 01:12:40.305
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:12:52.625 --> 01:12:54.685
She had come back into his life

01:12:54.725 --> 01:12:56.725
like a sudden flame,

01:12:56.765 --> 01:12:59.285
blazing and streaming
into his heart.

01:13:00.305 --> 01:13:01.705
Noah stayed up
all night

01:13:01.735 --> 01:13:05.265
contemplating the certain agony
he knew would be his,

01:13:05.305 --> 01:13:07.865
if he were
to lose her twice.

01:13:07.905 --> 01:13:11.865
Oh, I do wish I could
figure out the end of this story.

01:13:11.915 --> 01:13:14.675
The children are here.

01:13:14.715 --> 01:13:16.205
Children?

01:13:16.255 --> 01:13:18.345
- Not yours, his.
- Oh...

01:13:18.385 --> 01:13:20.375
Do you mind?

01:13:20.425 --> 01:13:22.485
Why, I'd love
to meet them.

01:13:22.525 --> 01:13:25.515
Come over here.

01:13:25.565 --> 01:13:27.965
- Hi, Daddy.
- Sweetheart, how are you?

01:13:27.995 --> 01:13:29.625
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, Maggie.

01:13:29.665 --> 01:13:32.425
Hi, I'm Allie.

01:13:32.465 --> 01:13:34.455
- Hi, I'm Mary Allen.
- Mary Allen.

01:13:34.505 --> 01:13:36.975
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

01:13:37.005 --> 01:13:38.565
- Hi.
- Hi, Maggie.

01:13:38.605 --> 01:13:41.135
Maggie, how are you?

01:13:41.175 --> 01:13:42.235
Hello there, honey.

01:13:42.275 --> 01:13:43.335
Hi, Davanee.

01:13:43.375 --> 01:13:45.865
- What a pretty name.
- Thank you.

01:13:45.915 --> 01:13:49.945
- Oh...
- Oh, how cute, thank you.

01:13:51.885 --> 01:13:54.185
- And who's this?
- Edmond.

01:13:54.225 --> 01:13:55.745
Hi, Edmond.

01:14:07.505 --> 01:14:09.765
You know, I think
I'll run on up

01:14:09.805 --> 01:14:12.795
and take my afternoon
nap, all right?

01:14:12.845 --> 01:14:16.075
- Come on, honey, let's go.
- There you go.

01:14:16.115 --> 01:14:17.905
- All right. Good.
- Thank you.

01:14:17.945 --> 01:14:19.935
I'll read some more later.

01:14:19.985 --> 01:14:22.575
All right, thank you.

01:14:22.615 --> 01:14:24.675
I'm so happy
to meet you all.

01:14:26.425 --> 01:14:28.155
- Goodbye.
- Bye, bye.

01:14:28.185 --> 01:14:29.455
- Nice to meet you.
- Goodbye.

01:14:29.495 --> 01:14:30.955
Bye.

01:14:32.495 --> 01:14:35.015
- She seems good today.
- She is good.

01:14:36.735 --> 01:14:39.325
I don't know, there's
something about today.

01:14:39.365 --> 01:14:41.665
Maybe it's a day
for a miracle.

01:14:43.635 --> 01:14:47.135
Daddy, come home.

01:14:47.175 --> 01:14:49.475
Mama doesn't know us.

01:14:49.515 --> 01:14:52.275
She doesn't recognize you.
She'll never understand.

01:14:52.315 --> 01:14:54.475
We miss you.

01:14:54.515 --> 01:14:56.345
This is crazy,
you living here.

01:14:56.385 --> 01:15:01.045
Yeah, you know we'll all help with Mom.
We can take shifts visiting.

01:15:02.425 --> 01:15:05.295
Look, guys,

01:15:05.325 --> 01:15:07.885
that's my sweetheart
in there.

01:15:07.925 --> 01:15:10.695
I'm not leaving her.

01:15:10.735 --> 01:15:13.595
This is my home now.

01:15:13.635 --> 01:15:15.295
Your mother is my home.

01:15:21.775 --> 01:15:23.205
- Hello?
- Hey, there.

01:15:23.245 --> 01:15:25.905
Hi, who is this?

01:15:25.945 --> 01:15:27.715
It's Lon,
who were you expecting?

01:15:27.745 --> 01:15:30.745
Uh, nobody, I...

01:15:30.785 --> 01:15:33.415
I just... I'm just surprised.
How... how did you find me?

01:15:33.455 --> 01:15:35.355
Well, there's only one
hotel in Seabrook.

01:15:35.385 --> 01:15:37.385
And when you didn't call,
I got worried.

01:15:37.425 --> 01:15:40.725
Where you been?
Are you all right?

01:15:40.765 --> 01:15:44.455
You know, I feel like an idiot, 'cause I
called your hotel about a hundred times.

01:15:46.505 --> 01:15:48.835
I'm fine.

01:15:48.875 --> 01:15:50.065
Anything you want
to tell me?

01:15:50.105 --> 01:15:52.835
- No.
- No?

01:15:52.875 --> 01:15:53.965
No.

01:15:57.815 --> 01:15:59.045
Okay.

01:16:01.715 --> 01:16:03.585
Lon, I love you.

01:16:03.615 --> 01:16:06.145
Call you tomorrow?

01:16:06.185 --> 01:16:07.675
Okay.

01:16:37.985 --> 01:16:38.975
Noah?

01:16:40.925 --> 01:16:42.185
Noah!

01:16:58.105 --> 01:17:00.165
Hey, there.

01:17:05.885 --> 01:17:08.315
Well, we better get going,
the rain's coming in.

01:17:33.805 --> 01:17:36.365
- You like it?
- It's spectacular.

01:17:41.685 --> 01:17:43.175
It's like a dream.

01:17:44.415 --> 01:17:47.215
- Do you want to feed them?
- Yeah.

01:18:05.235 --> 01:18:06.725
What are they all
doing here?

01:18:08.475 --> 01:18:10.375
I don't know.

01:18:10.415 --> 01:18:13.175
They're supposed to migrate
to the Guatemala sound.

01:18:13.215 --> 01:18:14.875
They won't stay here?

01:18:14.915 --> 01:18:16.815
No...

01:18:18.055 --> 01:18:21.025
they'll go back
where they came from.

01:18:31.895 --> 01:18:33.495
You're different.

01:18:33.535 --> 01:18:36.025
What do you mean?

01:18:37.675 --> 01:18:40.695
Just the way you look.
Everything.

01:18:40.745 --> 01:18:43.715
You look different too,
but in a good way.

01:18:49.455 --> 01:18:51.475
You know, you're kinda
the same though.

01:18:53.385 --> 01:18:55.325
Yeah?

01:18:55.355 --> 01:18:57.485
Yeah.

01:18:59.495 --> 01:19:01.895
And you really did it.

01:19:01.925 --> 01:19:04.365
- What?
- Everything.

01:19:04.395 --> 01:19:06.125
The house...

01:19:07.865 --> 01:19:09.895
it's beautiful
what you did.

01:19:13.275 --> 01:19:15.935
Well, I promised you
I would.

01:19:25.355 --> 01:19:27.515
Great.

01:19:27.555 --> 01:19:29.585
We got to go.

01:19:59.985 --> 01:20:02.115
Noah!

01:20:54.175 --> 01:20:55.835
Why didn't you
write me?

01:20:56.845 --> 01:20:58.205
Why?

01:20:59.585 --> 01:21:01.705
It wasn't over for me.

01:21:01.745 --> 01:21:04.415
I waited for you
for seven years.

01:21:04.455 --> 01:21:06.045
And now it's too late.

01:21:07.255 --> 01:21:10.015
I wrote you 365 letters.

01:21:12.025 --> 01:21:13.925
I wrote you every day
for a year.

01:21:13.965 --> 01:21:16.365
- You wrote me?
- Yes.

01:21:16.395 --> 01:21:18.295
You...

01:21:18.335 --> 01:21:20.635
It wasn't over.

01:21:21.635 --> 01:21:22.765
It still isn't over.

01:23:26.865 --> 01:23:29.295
Oh...

01:23:33.235 --> 01:23:35.095
You got
to be kidding me.

01:23:36.875 --> 01:23:39.235
All this time,
that's what I'd been missing?

01:23:44.045 --> 01:23:45.905
Let's do it again.

01:23:59.095 --> 01:24:01.225
Noah.

01:24:21.745 --> 01:24:22.945
Noah.

01:24:31.855 --> 01:24:33.825
Wake up.

01:24:35.095 --> 01:24:37.355
Wake up.

01:24:43.675 --> 01:24:47.105
- Hi.
- You're trying to kill me, woman.

01:24:53.515 --> 01:24:55.345
I need rest.

01:24:55.385 --> 01:24:59.645
I need food
so I can regain my strength.

01:25:00.725 --> 01:25:03.515
Okay, what do you want?

01:25:06.125 --> 01:25:09.095
Umm... umm...

01:25:09.125 --> 01:25:11.095
some pancakes.

01:25:11.135 --> 01:25:13.295
Okay.

01:25:13.335 --> 01:25:15.425
And bacon.

01:25:15.465 --> 01:25:18.405
- Okay.
- And some chicken.

01:26:04.315 --> 01:26:06.785
She's the one,
isn't she?

01:26:12.695 --> 01:26:14.885
Can I meet her?

01:26:17.165 --> 01:26:18.355
I'd really like to meet her.

01:26:18.395 --> 01:26:20.225
I don't know if that's
a good idea, Martha.

01:26:23.635 --> 01:26:26.105
So this is Martha?

01:26:26.145 --> 01:26:29.105
Hi, I'm Allie.

01:26:29.145 --> 01:26:31.135
I've heard
a lot about you.

01:26:32.345 --> 01:26:34.285
I've heard
a lot about you, too.

01:26:34.315 --> 01:26:36.145
You want to come in?

01:26:38.455 --> 01:26:39.885
Are you sure?

01:26:39.925 --> 01:26:43.115
Yeah, yeah,
Noah's just saying how hungry he was.

01:26:43.155 --> 01:26:45.595
And, you know,
you could put on a pot of tea.

01:26:47.695 --> 01:26:49.125
Come on in.

01:26:52.295 --> 01:26:54.135
Come on in.

01:27:03.215 --> 01:27:05.045
It was nice meeting you,
Martha.

01:27:05.075 --> 01:27:07.345
- Nice meeting you too.
- Goodbye.

01:27:07.385 --> 01:27:08.935
Take care.

01:27:27.935 --> 01:27:31.565
She's sensational.
She really is.

01:27:32.875 --> 01:27:34.705
I'm really glad
that I came, Noah.

01:27:40.115 --> 01:27:42.205
I'd forgotten
what it's like.

01:27:46.325 --> 01:27:49.385
For the first time
since I lost Richard,

01:27:49.425 --> 01:27:51.895
I feel like I've got something
to look forward to.

01:30:10.195 --> 01:30:12.295
Lon is on his way here.

01:30:14.635 --> 01:30:17.725
I'm afraid your father spilled
the beans about Noah,

01:30:17.775 --> 01:30:19.675
and when Lon didn't hear
from you again last night,

01:30:19.705 --> 01:30:20.795
he decided to come.

01:30:20.845 --> 01:30:24.005
Well, that's great.
That's just terrific.

01:30:24.045 --> 01:30:27.535
You, me, Noah and Lon,
one big happy family.

01:30:33.185 --> 01:30:36.015
Tell me about
the letters, Mother.

01:30:36.055 --> 01:30:38.325
- Is it true?
- Yes.

01:30:39.325 --> 01:30:42.095
You watched me
cry myself to sleep

01:30:42.125 --> 01:30:44.525
for months and months

01:30:44.565 --> 01:30:47.035
and you never
said anything.

01:30:47.065 --> 01:30:48.725
- How could you do that?
- I'm sorry.

01:30:48.765 --> 01:30:51.165
- You're sorry? You're sorry?
- Yes, I am... I am sorry.

01:30:51.205 --> 01:30:52.865
Because of you,
my entire life is ruined!

01:30:52.905 --> 01:30:54.535
Okay, yes,
I stole your letters.

01:30:54.575 --> 01:30:56.205
It was wrong,
but stop being dramatic

01:30:56.245 --> 01:30:58.215
and at least take some
of the responsibility.

01:31:00.345 --> 01:31:03.285
You came down here.
You knew what you were doing.

01:31:03.315 --> 01:31:04.685
You knew this would happen.

01:31:04.715 --> 01:31:06.845
Oh, so now I'm a tramp?

01:31:06.885 --> 01:31:08.615
You are unbelievable.

01:31:08.655 --> 01:31:10.745
Unbelievable.

01:31:14.425 --> 01:31:17.025
Go on and get
some clothes on.

01:31:17.065 --> 01:31:19.155
Let's take a drive.

01:31:19.195 --> 01:31:21.895
Let's take a drive? Why would I want
to go anywhere with you?

01:31:21.935 --> 01:31:25.565
Because I might know you
a little better than you think.

01:31:25.605 --> 01:31:28.095
And I don't want
you waking up one morning

01:31:28.145 --> 01:31:29.765
thinking that
if you'd known everything,

01:31:29.815 --> 01:31:31.365
you might have
done something different.

01:31:46.155 --> 01:31:47.885
What are we
doing here, Mama?

01:31:49.795 --> 01:31:52.165
Do you see
that man, there?

01:32:00.075 --> 01:32:03.005
Don't look like it now,
but 25 years ago...

01:32:04.615 --> 01:32:07.605
oh my goodness,
he was really something.

01:32:07.645 --> 01:32:10.275
We were out of our minds
in love, let me tell you.

01:32:17.555 --> 01:32:19.885
Well, naturally,
your grandfather was furious, so...

01:32:19.925 --> 01:32:22.125
we decided
to run away.

01:32:25.195 --> 01:32:28.635
We didn't even make the next town
before the police picked us up.

01:32:31.135 --> 01:32:33.295
But that was then.

01:32:35.575 --> 01:32:38.705
You know sometimes
when I'm in the area,

01:32:38.745 --> 01:32:41.335
I just stop here
and I watch him,

01:32:44.185 --> 01:32:47.955
trying to picture how different my life
might have been.

01:33:01.605 --> 01:33:05.235
I want you to know
that I love your father.

01:33:05.275 --> 01:33:07.295
- Mama, I'm...
- No, goddamn it, this is important

01:33:07.345 --> 01:33:09.635
and you need
to hear it. I do.

01:33:09.675 --> 01:33:12.165
He is a wonderful man.

01:33:12.215 --> 01:33:15.375
He is good to me
and I don't deserve him.

01:33:15.415 --> 01:33:18.215
I love him, Allie,
I do, I love him.

01:33:21.485 --> 01:33:22.925
I know.

01:33:27.695 --> 01:33:30.065
Oh, God.

01:33:31.465 --> 01:33:34.595
Oh, this is just
very embarrassing.

01:33:34.635 --> 01:33:37.965
Oh, I'm a stupid woman.

01:33:38.005 --> 01:33:40.705
Look at me,
the big old bawl-bag.

01:33:43.515 --> 01:33:45.375
It's crazy.

01:33:53.055 --> 01:33:56.485
I don't even know
who that person is.

01:34:05.095 --> 01:34:06.625
Oh, boy.

01:34:34.765 --> 01:34:36.165
Okay.

01:34:46.005 --> 01:34:47.475
Allie!

01:35:04.325 --> 01:35:06.015
Here.

01:35:10.895 --> 01:35:13.925
I hope you make
the right choice.

01:35:40.095 --> 01:35:42.495
Interesting morning?

01:35:42.525 --> 01:35:43.515
Yeah.

01:35:45.965 --> 01:35:47.625
Lon's here in town.

01:35:50.805 --> 01:35:52.565
He's here?

01:35:54.545 --> 01:35:56.775
Yeah, we saw
his car on the way,

01:35:56.815 --> 01:35:58.405
at the hotel.

01:36:08.585 --> 01:36:10.485
I see you
got my letters.

01:36:14.065 --> 01:36:15.895
Finally.

01:36:22.805 --> 01:36:24.425
What are you
going to do, Al?

01:36:28.745 --> 01:36:30.835
I don't know.

01:36:37.955 --> 01:36:39.975
We're back to that?

01:36:41.585 --> 01:36:43.185
Are we back there?

01:36:45.055 --> 01:36:47.895
What about the past couple of days?
They happened, you know?

01:36:47.925 --> 01:36:50.125
I know that they happened,
and they were wonderful,

01:36:50.165 --> 01:36:53.365
but they were also
very irresponsible.

01:36:53.395 --> 01:36:55.365
I have a fiance
waiting for me at a hotel,

01:36:55.405 --> 01:36:56.625
who's going
to be crushed

01:36:56.665 --> 01:36:58.155
- when he finds out.
- So you make love to me

01:36:58.205 --> 01:37:00.465
and then you go back
to your husband?

01:37:00.505 --> 01:37:02.335
Was that your plan?

01:37:02.375 --> 01:37:04.205
Was that a test
that I didn't pass?!

01:37:04.245 --> 01:37:06.875
No, I made a promise to a man, he gave
me a ring and I gave him my word.

01:37:06.915 --> 01:37:08.145
And your word is
shot to hell now,

01:37:08.185 --> 01:37:09.705
- don't you think?
- I don't... I don't know.

01:37:09.745 --> 01:37:11.275
I'll find out
when I talk to him.

01:37:11.315 --> 01:37:13.305
This is not about
keeping your promise,

01:37:13.355 --> 01:37:15.915
and it's not about
following your heart,

01:37:15.955 --> 01:37:17.685
it's about security.

01:37:17.725 --> 01:37:19.855
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Money!

01:37:19.895 --> 01:37:21.865
- What are you ta...
- He's got a lot of money.

01:37:21.895 --> 01:37:23.955
- Now I hate you, you smug bastard.
- Well, I hate you.

01:37:23.995 --> 01:37:25.865
- If you leave here, I hate you.
- You wou...

01:37:25.895 --> 01:37:27.425
- Hate you if you leave here.
- Have you been paying attention

01:37:27.465 --> 01:37:28.555
to anything that's happening?

01:37:28.605 --> 01:37:30.565
I guess not.
I think I must have misread

01:37:30.605 --> 01:37:32.335
- all of those signals.
- I guess you did.

01:37:34.975 --> 01:37:37.735
You're bored.
You're bored and you know it.

01:37:37.775 --> 01:37:40.245
You wouldn't be here
if there wasn't something missing.

01:37:40.285 --> 01:37:43.015
You arrogant
son of a bitch!

01:37:44.185 --> 01:37:45.985
Would you just
stay with me?

01:37:46.015 --> 01:37:47.855
Stay with you?
What for?

01:37:47.885 --> 01:37:50.875
- Look at us, we're already fighting.
- Well, that's what we do.

01:37:50.925 --> 01:37:52.325
We fight.

01:37:52.355 --> 01:37:54.555
You tell me when I'm being
an arrogant son of a bitch

01:37:54.595 --> 01:37:56.895
and I tell you when you're
being a pain in the ass.

01:37:56.935 --> 01:38:00.125
Which you are
99% of the time.

01:38:00.165 --> 01:38:02.495
I'm not afraid
to hurt your feelings.

01:38:02.535 --> 01:38:04.435
They have like
a two second rebound rate

01:38:04.475 --> 01:38:07.265
and you're back doing the next
pain-in-the-ass thing.

01:38:07.305 --> 01:38:08.295
So, what?

01:38:08.345 --> 01:38:10.905
So it's not gonna be easy.
It's gonna be really hard.

01:38:10.945 --> 01:38:13.245
And we're gonna have to work
at this every day,

01:38:13.275 --> 01:38:15.245
but I want to do that,
because I want you.

01:38:15.285 --> 01:38:20.275
I want all of you,
forever, you and me, every day.

01:38:20.325 --> 01:38:22.725
Will you do
something for me?

01:38:22.755 --> 01:38:25.785
Please?
Will you just picture your life for me?

01:38:27.265 --> 01:38:30.785
30 years from now,
40 years from now, what's it look like?

01:38:30.835 --> 01:38:33.525
If it's with
that guy, go! Go!

01:38:33.565 --> 01:38:36.295
I lost you once,
I think I could do it again,

01:38:36.335 --> 01:38:38.275
if I thought it's
what you really wanted.

01:38:38.305 --> 01:38:40.895
But don't you take
the easy way out.

01:38:40.945 --> 01:38:43.135
What easy way?
There is no easy way,

01:38:43.175 --> 01:38:45.505
no matter what I do,
somebody gets hurt.

01:38:45.545 --> 01:38:47.775
Would you stop thinking
about what everyone wants.

01:38:47.815 --> 01:38:50.475
Stop thinking
about what I want, what he wants,

01:38:50.515 --> 01:38:53.545
what your parents want.
What do you want?

01:38:55.025 --> 01:38:57.255
- What do you want?
- It's not that simple.

01:38:57.295 --> 01:39:00.555
- What do you want?
- It's not...

01:39:01.795 --> 01:39:03.765
Goddamn it,
what do you want?

01:39:06.565 --> 01:39:08.465
I have to go.

01:40:17.575 --> 01:40:19.835
My dearest Allie,

01:40:19.875 --> 01:40:23.205
I couldn't sleep last night because
I know that it's over between us.

01:40:25.115 --> 01:40:28.475
I'm not bitter anymore, because I know
that what we had was real.

01:40:30.145 --> 01:40:32.045
And if in some distant
place in the future

01:40:32.085 --> 01:40:34.715
we see each other
in our new lives,

01:40:34.755 --> 01:40:36.385
I'll smile
at you with joy

01:40:36.425 --> 01:40:40.555
and remember how
we spent a summer beneath the trees

01:40:40.595 --> 01:40:44.465
learning from each other
and growing in love.

01:41:01.115 --> 01:41:04.415
The best love
is the kind that awakens the soul

01:41:04.455 --> 01:41:06.945
and makes us
reach for more,

01:41:06.985 --> 01:41:09.285
that plants a fire
in our hearts

01:41:09.325 --> 01:41:12.125
and brings peace
to our minds.

01:41:12.155 --> 01:41:14.955
And that's what you've
given me.

01:41:14.995 --> 01:41:17.865
That's what I'd hoped
to give to you forever.

01:41:17.895 --> 01:41:21.955
I love you.
I'll be seeing you, Noah.

01:41:23.265 --> 01:41:27.005
It's beautiful.
It's a beautiful story.

01:41:27.045 --> 01:41:28.335
Yes, it is.

01:41:28.375 --> 01:41:31.705
I don't know why,
but it makes me feel sad.

01:41:34.685 --> 01:41:36.675
I know you feel
lost right now,

01:41:36.715 --> 01:41:38.545
but don't worry,

01:41:38.585 --> 01:41:41.075
nothing is ever lost,
nor can be lost.

01:41:41.125 --> 01:41:44.925
The body sluggish,
aged, cold,

01:41:44.955 --> 01:41:47.155
the embers left

01:41:47.195 --> 01:41:48.885
from earlier fires.

01:41:48.925 --> 01:41:50.795
Shall duly flame again.

01:41:53.065 --> 01:41:54.155
Did you write that?

01:41:54.205 --> 01:41:57.565
No, that was Walt Whitman.

01:42:00.075 --> 01:42:01.195
I think I knew him.

01:42:02.205 --> 01:42:03.605
I think you did.

01:42:03.645 --> 01:42:08.635
Shall we go in?
I'm feeling a little chilly.

01:42:08.685 --> 01:42:10.705
Okay.

01:42:10.755 --> 01:42:12.545
Thank you.

01:42:22.465 --> 01:42:24.055
Well, who did
all of this?

01:42:24.095 --> 01:42:28.095
I did, with a little help
from my friends on the nursing staff.

01:42:28.135 --> 01:42:30.325
Oh...

01:42:43.315 --> 01:42:46.875
I've never seen
anything so beautiful.

01:42:46.915 --> 01:42:48.645
Neither have I.

01:42:51.595 --> 01:42:52.815
Shall we?

01:43:01.465 --> 01:43:03.365
- Some grape juice?
- I'd love it.

01:43:06.105 --> 01:43:09.095
Ah, so many pills.
How sick are you?

01:43:09.145 --> 01:43:13.015
The sickness has become
a relative term for me.

01:43:13.045 --> 01:43:17.675
I think of it now as more a general
wearing out process.

01:43:19.485 --> 01:43:20.475
To you.

01:43:29.665 --> 01:43:31.495
So what happened?

01:43:31.535 --> 01:43:33.295
In the story,

01:43:33.335 --> 01:43:35.495
which one did she choose?

01:43:39.675 --> 01:43:41.035
Okay,

01:43:42.975 --> 01:43:45.805
the way I see it,
I got three choices.

01:43:45.845 --> 01:43:47.435
One, I can shoot him.

01:43:47.485 --> 01:43:51.475
Two, I can kick
the crap out of him.

01:43:51.515 --> 01:43:54.815
Or three...
I leave you.

01:44:01.225 --> 01:44:03.495
Well, all that's no good.

01:44:05.335 --> 01:44:07.065
You see, 'cause...

01:44:08.735 --> 01:44:11.255
none of those options
get me you.

01:44:14.145 --> 01:44:16.765
And in spite of everything,

01:44:16.805 --> 01:44:18.275
I love you.

01:44:21.115 --> 01:44:22.445
I love you too.

01:44:24.385 --> 01:44:26.515
I meant what I said
when I gave you that ring.

01:44:26.555 --> 01:44:27.885
I did too.

01:44:27.925 --> 01:44:30.545
I did too.
It's just that when I'm...

01:44:30.595 --> 01:44:32.755
when I'm with Noah
I feel like one person

01:44:32.795 --> 01:44:36.095
and when I'm with you
I feel like someone totally different.

01:44:38.335 --> 01:44:42.135
Look, it's normal
not to forget your first love.

01:44:49.975 --> 01:44:52.465
I love you, Allie,

01:44:52.515 --> 01:44:55.605
but I want you
for myself.

01:44:55.645 --> 01:44:57.375
I don't want to have
to convince my fiance

01:44:57.415 --> 01:44:59.905
that she should be
with me.

01:44:59.955 --> 01:45:03.115
You don't have to.

01:45:04.255 --> 01:45:06.555
I already know
I should be with you.

01:45:09.065 --> 01:45:10.925
And they lived happily
ever after.

01:45:10.965 --> 01:45:14.555
Who? Who did?

01:45:22.805 --> 01:45:25.675
Oh yes,

01:45:25.715 --> 01:45:27.645
of course.

01:46:09.525 --> 01:46:11.385
I remember now.

01:46:12.695 --> 01:46:14.665
It was us.

01:46:15.825 --> 01:46:18.165
- It was us. It was us.
- Oh, my darling.

01:46:18.195 --> 01:46:20.565
Oh my sweetheart.

01:46:20.595 --> 01:46:23.565
I love you so much.

01:46:25.605 --> 01:46:27.075
Oh, my baby.

01:46:29.275 --> 01:46:31.105
Noah, Noah.

01:46:31.145 --> 01:46:33.635
I love you, Angel.

01:46:36.415 --> 01:46:38.545
- What happened to me?
- Nothing.

01:46:38.585 --> 01:46:41.215
You just went away
for a little while.

01:46:45.255 --> 01:46:49.455
- How much time do we have?
- I'm not sure.

01:46:49.495 --> 01:46:51.825
Last time it was no more
than five minutes.

01:46:54.505 --> 01:46:56.695
Okay.

01:46:56.735 --> 01:47:00.905
Hey, I brought along
an old friend.

01:47:18.025 --> 01:47:22.155
# I'll be seeing you #

01:47:22.195 --> 01:47:27.295
# In all the old
familiar places #

01:47:27.335 --> 01:47:32.735
# That this heart
of mine embraces #

01:47:32.775 --> 01:47:35.635
# All day through #

01:47:38.275 --> 01:47:41.805
# In that small cafe... #

01:47:41.845 --> 01:47:45.145
- How are the children?
- Oh, they're fine.

01:47:45.185 --> 01:47:47.155
Now,
they were here today...

01:47:47.185 --> 01:47:49.955
Little Noah, Davanee too.

01:47:49.985 --> 01:47:51.585
They're getting so big.

01:47:51.625 --> 01:47:56.025
- #... carousel, the chestnut trees #
- Oh, boy.

01:47:56.065 --> 01:47:58.085
- # The wishing well... #
- How fast the time goes.

01:47:59.665 --> 01:48:01.655
It flies right on by.

01:48:01.705 --> 01:48:03.635
Oh yes, it does.

01:48:03.665 --> 01:48:09.105
# In every lovely
summer's day... #

01:48:09.145 --> 01:48:11.335
Will you tell them
I love them?

01:48:11.375 --> 01:48:14.675
- # That's light and gay #
- Of course I will.

01:48:14.715 --> 01:48:16.475
- # I'll always #
- And that I'm sorry.

01:48:16.515 --> 01:48:19.075
# Think of you that way #

01:48:19.115 --> 01:48:21.105
- I'll tell them, sweetheart.
- # I'll find you #

01:48:21.155 --> 01:48:24.955
# In the morning sun #

01:48:24.995 --> 01:48:28.685
# And when
the night is new #

01:48:29.995 --> 01:48:34.095
# I'll be looking at the moon #
# But I'll be seeing you... #

01:48:34.135 --> 01:48:37.125
Remember that story you were
reading to me?

01:48:37.165 --> 01:48:39.065
Why, yes.

01:48:45.575 --> 01:48:48.415
Do you think that
I could be her tonight?

01:48:50.185 --> 01:48:51.775
Would that be
all right?

01:48:52.815 --> 01:48:54.585
You know what
we could do?

01:48:54.625 --> 01:48:58.215
Maybe we could get a car
and we could go for a ride.

01:48:58.255 --> 01:49:01.815
Why could get out of here
and just go someplace, you want to?

01:49:01.865 --> 01:49:04.985
I don't think so.
Not tonight, darling.

01:49:05.035 --> 01:49:07.765
Come on, why not?

01:49:07.805 --> 01:49:09.795
Wait a minute...

01:49:11.705 --> 01:49:15.235
why did you call me darling?
I don't know you.

01:49:15.275 --> 01:49:18.265
What's going on here?
Am I supposed to know you?

01:49:18.315 --> 01:49:21.105
- Allie... Allie, sweetheart.
- No, no, no!

01:49:21.145 --> 01:49:23.705
Hey, Allie, I love you,
stay with me, don't leave...

01:49:23.745 --> 01:49:26.015
No!

01:49:26.055 --> 01:49:29.175
- Who are you?
- I'm Noah, I'm Noah and you're Allie.

01:49:29.225 --> 01:49:31.785
What do you want?
What are you doing here?

01:49:31.825 --> 01:49:34.055
- Come on, baby.
- Don't come near me!

01:49:34.095 --> 01:49:35.955
- Don't you come near me!
- Allie... Allie, I...

01:49:35.995 --> 01:49:37.695
Help! Help!

01:49:37.735 --> 01:49:39.725
- Help me!
- Calm down, Allie, calm down.

01:49:39.765 --> 01:49:40.755
No, no, not you!

01:49:40.795 --> 01:49:42.425
Calm down, Allie! It's all right, sugar,
come on.

01:49:42.465 --> 01:49:44.365
- No! Let me go!
- It's all right, baby. Just calm down!

01:49:44.405 --> 01:49:47.775
- No! Leave me alone.
- Calm down, Allie, it's all right.

01:49:47.805 --> 01:49:49.775
- Somebody help me!
- Now calm down.

01:49:49.805 --> 01:49:50.905
- Help!
- Doctor!

01:49:50.945 --> 01:49:52.875
Talk to me.

01:49:52.915 --> 01:49:55.275
- Somebody help me!
- Calm down!

01:49:55.315 --> 01:49:58.245
- Give her two cc's.
- No! No!

01:49:58.285 --> 01:49:59.415
Calm down, Allie.

01:49:59.455 --> 01:50:01.075
- Calm down, Allie, yes.
- One, two...

01:50:01.125 --> 01:50:02.815
...three.

01:50:02.855 --> 01:50:05.755
- Allie, it's all right. It's all right.
- Okay, okay, okay.

01:50:05.795 --> 01:50:07.345
Okay, now take a look.

01:50:07.395 --> 01:50:10.155
Let's take a look.
One... oh, she's fine.

01:50:10.195 --> 01:50:12.425
- Good. Just breathe.
- She's fine. She's fine.

01:50:12.465 --> 01:50:15.265
Stay calm, just breathe
in and out, come on.

01:50:15.305 --> 01:50:17.535
- Relax...
- You're going to be okay, Allie.

01:50:17.575 --> 01:50:18.935
- Relax.
- Allie?

01:50:18.975 --> 01:50:21.565
You're fine, honey.

01:50:22.845 --> 01:50:27.215
# I'll be seeing you #

01:50:27.245 --> 01:50:32.615
# In every lovely
summer's day #

01:50:32.655 --> 01:50:38.355
# In everything
that's light and gay #

01:50:38.395 --> 01:50:42.755
# I'll always think
of you that way #

01:50:42.795 --> 01:50:48.195
# I'll find you
in the morning sun #

01:50:48.235 --> 01:50:51.605
# And when
the night is new... #

01:50:56.145 --> 01:50:58.605
# I'll be looking
at the moon #

01:51:01.985 --> 01:51:07.285
# But I'll be seeing you #

01:51:07.315 --> 01:51:09.445
# I'll be seeing you #

01:51:09.485 --> 01:51:13.185
# I'll be seeing you. #

01:51:20.135 --> 01:51:22.155
Morning, Mr. Calhoun.

01:51:23.465 --> 01:51:24.525
Mr. Calhoun?

01:51:26.775 --> 01:51:29.265
Call Dr. Von Pettit
and USC, okay?

01:51:29.305 --> 01:51:31.675
I've got no BP, I got no pulse.
I've got nothing.

01:51:31.715 --> 01:51:34.005
Let them know we are in full arrest.
Call me on my cell.

01:51:34.045 --> 01:51:36.445
Okay, will do.

01:51:52.795 --> 01:51:55.695
We talked about this.

01:51:55.735 --> 01:51:58.395
It's all right now.
Come on, come on, precious.

01:51:58.435 --> 01:52:01.135
Okay, yes,
come on, let's go.

01:52:01.175 --> 01:52:02.935
It's okay, baby,
come on.

01:52:02.975 --> 01:52:05.405
You know Mr. Holmes.

01:52:09.145 --> 01:52:10.975
Just try it.

01:52:56.525 --> 01:52:58.225
Oh, Mr. Calhoun.

01:52:59.665 --> 01:53:01.255
Welcome back.

01:53:01.305 --> 01:53:05.035
- How do you feel?
- Fine. Fit as a fiddle.

01:53:05.075 --> 01:53:08.505
- Where you going?
- I was just taking a walk.

01:53:08.545 --> 01:53:10.905
I can't sleep.

01:53:10.945 --> 01:53:13.635
Well, you know you're not supposed to,
it's against the rules.

01:53:13.675 --> 01:53:16.115
Yeah, I know.

01:53:16.145 --> 01:53:19.345
You weren't really
going for a walk, were you?

01:53:19.385 --> 01:53:21.575
You were going
to see Miss Allie.

01:53:22.885 --> 01:53:25.185
I just got out
of the hospital

01:53:25.225 --> 01:53:27.055
and I miss her.

01:53:27.095 --> 01:53:29.085
Mr. Calhoun,

01:53:29.125 --> 01:53:31.755
I'm sorry, but I can't
let you see her tonight.

01:53:31.795 --> 01:53:35.325
Now you're gonna have
to go back to your room.

01:53:37.335 --> 01:53:38.535
As for me,

01:53:38.575 --> 01:53:40.565
I'm gonna
go downstairs

01:53:40.605 --> 01:53:43.205
and get myself
a cup of coffee.

01:53:43.245 --> 01:53:46.075
I won't be back
to check on you for a while,

01:53:46.115 --> 01:53:48.175
so don't
do anything foolish.

01:54:44.435 --> 01:54:45.925
Hi.

01:54:55.215 --> 01:54:56.205
Noah.

01:54:58.515 --> 01:54:59.745
Noah.

01:55:02.625 --> 01:55:05.315
Hi, sweetheart.

01:55:05.355 --> 01:55:08.585
I'm sorry I haven't
been able to be here to read to you.

01:55:09.895 --> 01:55:12.485
I didn't know
what to do.

01:55:12.535 --> 01:55:15.155
I was afraid
you were never coming back.

01:55:15.205 --> 01:55:17.165
I'll always come back.

01:55:22.075 --> 01:55:25.065
What's gonna happen

01:55:25.115 --> 01:55:28.205
when I can't
remember anything any more?

01:55:30.185 --> 01:55:31.375
What will you do?

01:55:31.415 --> 01:55:34.475
I'll be here.

01:55:34.515 --> 01:55:36.745
I'll never leave you.

01:55:45.965 --> 01:55:48.435
I need to ask
you something.

01:55:48.465 --> 01:55:50.265
What is it,
sweetheart?

01:55:54.775 --> 01:55:57.905
Do you think

01:55:57.945 --> 01:55:59.935
that our love

01:55:59.975 --> 01:56:02.075
can create miracles?

01:56:03.615 --> 01:56:05.485
Yes, I do.

01:56:06.885 --> 01:56:10.155
That's what brings
you back to me each time.

01:56:18.365 --> 01:56:21.625
Do you think our love

01:56:21.665 --> 01:56:23.895
could take us
away together?

01:56:30.605 --> 01:56:34.305
I think our love
can do anything we want it to.

01:56:47.325 --> 01:56:50.315
I love you.

01:56:50.365 --> 01:56:52.385
I love you, Allie.

01:57:09.215 --> 01:57:11.645
Good night.

01:57:11.685 --> 01:57:13.675
Good night.

01:57:18.595 --> 01:57:21.055
I'll be seeing you.

01:57:22.065 --> 01:57:24.925
# La la la la #

01:57:24.965 --> 01:57:26.695
# Da da da da #

01:57:26.735 --> 01:57:28.855
# Dum ba da #

01:57:29.305 --> 01:57:35.479
