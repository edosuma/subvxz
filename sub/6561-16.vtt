WEBVTT

00:10.244 --> 00:11.445
- SO HOT!

00:11.512 --> 00:15.449
- SO HOT! SO HOT!

00:15.516 --> 00:18.786
OH.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.554
- IT'S 95 DEGREES OUT.

00:20.621 --> 00:23.524
WHY IS BITTERS THE ONLY ONE
IN THE POOL?

00:23.591 --> 00:26.827
- HEY, GUYS, CHECK OUT THE SIGN.

00:26.894 --> 00:31.031
- "ADULT SWIM.
NO KIDS ALLOWED."

00:31.099 --> 00:32.066
- THAT'S JUST PLAIN RUDE.

00:32.133 --> 00:33.801
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.603
YOU GUYS ARE READING IT WRONG.

00:35.669 --> 00:39.107
IT SAYS, "ADULT SWIM?

00:39.173 --> 00:43.311
NO, KIDS ALLOWED!"

00:43.377 --> 00:46.247
[all screaming]

00:51.452 --> 00:53.287
- YOU GUYS ARE GREAT.
- I KNOW.

00:53.354 --> 00:55.089
- NO, I MEAN IT.

00:55.156 --> 00:56.590
I MEAN, A FEW MONTHS
IN HOLLYWOOD

00:56.657 --> 00:58.259
USUALLY CHANGES PEOPLE,

00:58.326 --> 01:00.294
BUT YOU'RE STILL THE SAME
DOWN-TO-EARTH GUYS YOU WERE

01:00.361 --> 01:01.762
WHEN YOU GOT HERE.

01:01.829 --> 01:02.930
- HEY, GUYS.

01:07.301 --> 01:10.971
ANOTHER TAN-TASTIC DAY
IN HOLLYWOOD.

01:11.038 --> 01:14.808
- * AH, AH, AH-AH, OH *

01:14.875 --> 01:16.710
- * MAKE IT COUNT,

01:16.777 --> 01:18.512
* DON'T LOOK BACK,
DON'T HESITATE *

01:18.579 --> 01:22.683
- * WHEN YOU GO BIG TIME *

01:22.750 --> 01:24.585
- * WHAT YOU WANT,
WHAT YOU FEEL *

01:24.652 --> 01:26.420
* NEVER QUIT
AND MAKE IT REAL *

01:26.487 --> 01:29.557
- * WHEN YOU ROLL BIG TIME *

01:29.623 --> 01:30.624
- * OH-OH, OH-OH *

01:30.691 --> 01:32.460
- * HEY, HEY *

01:32.526 --> 01:34.562
- * LISTEN TO YOUR HEART NOW *

01:34.628 --> 01:36.297
- * HEY, HEY *

01:36.364 --> 01:38.499
- * DON'T YOU FEEL THE RUSH *

01:38.566 --> 01:40.168
- * UH-OH, UH-OH *

01:40.201 --> 01:41.469
* UH-OH, UH-OH *

01:41.535 --> 01:42.470
- * OH *

01:42.536 --> 01:43.871
- * GO AND SHAKE IT UP *

01:43.937 --> 01:46.407
* WHATCHA GOTTA LOSE *

01:46.474 --> 01:47.808
* GO AND MAKE YOUR LUCK *

01:47.875 --> 01:50.411
* WITH THE LIFE YOU CHOOSE *

01:50.478 --> 01:54.081
* IF YOU WANT IT ALL,
LAY IT ON THE LINE *

01:54.182 --> 01:59.187
* IT'S THE ONLY LIFE YOU GOT
SO YOU GOT TO LIVE IT BIG TIME *

02:06.694 --> 02:09.397
- DOES HE KNOW
HE LOOKS LIKE A YAM?

02:09.463 --> 02:11.565
- LOOKS LIKE I SPOKE TOO SOON.

02:11.632 --> 02:14.435
JAMES HAS HOLLYWOOD FEVER.

02:14.502 --> 02:16.069
- OH, NO.

02:16.204 --> 02:19.106
I TOLD HIM NOT TO BUY CLAMS
FROM THAT GUY ON THE FREEWAY.

02:19.207 --> 02:21.575
- NO, THIS TOWN
IS STARTING TO CHANGE HIM,

02:21.642 --> 02:24.212
AND THE HEAT IS CLEARLY
MAKING IT WORSE.

02:24.212 --> 02:25.779
- NOT POSSIBLE.

02:25.846 --> 02:29.450
LOOK, WE MADE A PACT WHEN WE GOT
HERE TO STAY TRUE TO OURSELVES.

02:29.517 --> 02:32.320
- YEAH, LOOK AT HIM.

02:32.386 --> 02:34.388
YOU HAVE TO SHUT THIS DOWN
BEFORE IT SNOWBALLS,

02:34.455 --> 02:36.624
LIKE IT DID WITH GUITAR DUDE.

02:36.690 --> 02:39.327
- WHAT'S UP?

02:39.393 --> 02:42.930
- WHEN HE FIRST MOVED HERE,
HE WAS A CONCERT CELLIST.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.632
- * WHAT IS UP *

02:44.698 --> 02:46.066
* WHAT IS UP *

02:46.133 --> 02:49.403
* WHAT IS UP *

02:49.470 --> 02:54.242
- OH, YEAH, AND WHEN
THE JENNIFERS MOVED HERE,

02:54.242 --> 02:55.843
THEY WALKED IN NORMAL MOTION.

02:59.513 --> 03:00.514
- [grunts]

03:00.581 --> 03:02.783
- HOLLYWOOD FEVER.

03:02.850 --> 03:05.519
SO THAT EXPLAINS
ALL YOUR WEIRD BEHAVIOR.

03:05.586 --> 03:06.454
- WHAT WEIRD BEHAVIOR?

03:12.125 --> 03:14.495
- HOLLYWOOD FEVER.

03:14.562 --> 03:18.065
I'LL CURE HIS HOLLYWOOD FEVER.

03:18.131 --> 03:20.834
JAMES, YOU'RE ORANGE,
AND YOU LOOK LIKE A FREAK.

03:20.901 --> 03:26.340
- ACTUALLY, I'M MANGERINE,

03:26.407 --> 03:30.278
AS IN MANGERINE ACTION TAN
BY CUDA.

03:30.344 --> 03:33.146
[snarls]

03:33.281 --> 03:36.350
IN HOLLYWOOD, IF YOU CAN'T
TAN WITH THE BIG BOYS,

03:36.417 --> 03:38.519
DON'T EVEN BOTHER
SHOWING UP AT ALL.

03:38.586 --> 03:40.621
- I DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW TO RESPOND TO THAT.

03:40.688 --> 03:43.023
- YEAH, JAMES, WE ALL AGREED
THAT WE WOULDN'T

03:43.090 --> 03:44.057
LET THIS TOWN CHANGE US.

03:44.124 --> 03:45.626
- HEY, I'M STILL ME...

03:45.693 --> 03:46.627
JUST BETTER.

03:46.694 --> 03:49.930
- JAMES, GIVE US THE SPRAY NOW!

03:49.997 --> 03:51.332
- ACTION TAN ACTIVATE!

03:51.399 --> 03:53.200
[yelling]

03:53.301 --> 03:56.203
[all coughing]

03:56.304 --> 03:57.137
- GET HIM.

04:02.876 --> 04:06.179
- OH LOOK,
IT'S DEVIL BOY'S SISTER.

04:06.314 --> 04:09.082
WHAT'S ALL THIS?
- A SNOW CONE STAND.

04:09.149 --> 04:11.619
THIS HEAT WAVE'S MY CHANCE
TO TAKE OVER THIS TOWN.

04:11.685 --> 04:13.153
- [laughs]

04:13.220 --> 04:16.324
YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE OVER
THIS TOWN WITH COLORED ICE?

04:16.324 --> 04:17.558
- NO.

04:17.625 --> 04:18.692
FIRST I REINVEST MY PROFITS

04:18.759 --> 04:20.461
INTO THE BOOMING
AGRIBUSINESS SECTOR,

04:20.528 --> 04:23.564
CORNER THE MARKET IN SOY FUTURES
TO MAKE A COOL 100 MIL,

04:23.631 --> 04:25.032
THEN COMBINE CASH
AND STOCK OPTIONS

04:25.098 --> 04:26.834
TO PURCHASE
A MAJOR MOVIE STUDIO,

04:26.900 --> 04:29.236
THEN TAKE OVER THIS TOWN.

04:29.337 --> 04:31.705
- AREN'T YOU A WITTLE TYCOON?

04:31.772 --> 04:35.943
YES, YOU ARE.
YES, YOU ARE.

04:36.009 --> 04:38.879
[all talking at once]

04:47.054 --> 04:48.055
all: * STUCK, STUCK *

04:48.121 --> 04:49.390
* AND I'M NEVER GIVING *

04:49.457 --> 04:50.824
* UP, UP *

04:50.891 --> 04:53.594
* IN THE MIDDLE
OF A PERFECT DAY *

04:53.661 --> 04:57.197
* I'M TRIPPING OVER
WORDS TO SAY *

04:57.264 --> 05:00.033
* 'CAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO KEEP YOU GUESSING *

05:00.100 --> 05:02.570
* BUT I ALWAYS END UP GETTING *

05:02.636 --> 05:05.138
* STUCK, STUCK *
- CUT! CUT!

05:05.205 --> 05:09.510
WILL SOMEBODY PLEASE TELL ME
WHY JAMES IS ORANGE?

05:09.577 --> 05:12.380
- ACTUALLY, I'M MANGERINE.

05:12.413 --> 05:15.549
[snarls]

05:15.616 --> 05:20.153
- BOYS, CAN I SEE YOU OUT HERE
FOR JUST A QUICK MINUTE?

05:23.023 --> 05:24.392
- SOMETHING WRONG, BOSS?

05:24.392 --> 05:30.130
- JAMES, IN THIS BUSINESS,
IMAGE IS EVERYTHING,

05:30.197 --> 05:34.735
AND THE IMAGE I'M GOING FOR
IS NOT THREE NORMAL BOYS

05:34.802 --> 05:36.804
AND A TANGERINE FREAK.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.071
- SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT

05:38.138 --> 05:39.407
THE OTHER THREE GUYS
ARE TOO PALE.

05:39.473 --> 05:43.076
I CAN FIX IT.
all: NO!

05:43.143 --> 05:45.579
- WE THINK HE MIGHT
HAVE HOLLYWOOD FEVER.

05:45.646 --> 05:46.947
- YOU, DON'T PANIC.

05:47.014 --> 05:49.750
YOU, STOP BEING ORANGE!

05:49.817 --> 05:51.585
- NO! NO!
MY MANGERINE!

05:51.652 --> 05:52.820
- JUST GIVE IT TO ME.

05:52.886 --> 05:54.788
- MINE!
- GIVE IT TO ME!

05:54.855 --> 05:56.189
HA!

05:56.256 --> 05:59.126
- HA-HA!

05:59.192 --> 06:02.195
[snarls]

06:02.262 --> 06:03.964
- WELL, THAT DIDN'T WORK.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.666
LET'S TRY THIS.

06:05.733 --> 06:09.302
FIX YOUR FRIEND,
OR I WILL FIRE HIM

06:09.437 --> 06:14.007
AND REPLACE HIM WITH SOMEONE
THAT IS NOT ORANGE!

06:18.579 --> 06:21.214
- HE'S NOT IN THE BATHROOM.

06:21.281 --> 06:24.452
- HE'S NOT IN THE SWIRLY SLIDE.

06:24.452 --> 06:27.921
- BUT LOOK, I FOUND AN EMPTY
BOTTLE OF MANGERINE ACTION TAN.

06:27.988 --> 06:32.560
ACCORDING TO THE LABEL,
THIS STUFF DISSOLVES WITH WATER.

06:32.626 --> 06:33.994
- YOU THINKING
WHAT I'M THINKING?

06:38.231 --> 06:41.001
I WAS THINKING WE GET SNOW CONES
TO BEAT THE HEAT,

06:41.068 --> 06:42.603
BUT THIS WORKS TOO.

06:42.670 --> 06:46.006
- AND SHOULD BREAK
THE FEVER QUITE NICELY.

06:46.073 --> 06:48.709
- CARLITOS, YOU SCOPE THE POOL
FOR ORANGE JAMES.

06:48.776 --> 06:51.178
LOGAN-ATOR,
YOU HIT PALM WOODS PARK.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.380
AND I'LL STAKE OUT THE LOBBY.

06:53.481 --> 06:57.150
MOVE OUT.

06:57.217 --> 06:58.719
- [squeals]

06:58.786 --> 07:01.221
[all grunting]

07:01.288 --> 07:03.957
[all squealing]

07:10.330 --> 07:13.567
- TYLER.

07:13.634 --> 07:15.202
HAVE YOU SEEN ORANGE JAMES?

07:15.268 --> 07:18.071
- NO, BUT HERE COME
THE JENNIFERS.

07:30.017 --> 07:31.284
- OH, WHO ARE WE KIDDING?

07:31.351 --> 07:33.654
- THIS JUST ISN'T WORKING.

07:33.721 --> 07:35.823
- HEY,
WHERE'S THE OTHER JENNIFER?

07:35.889 --> 07:37.891
- SHE TOOK A SOAP OPERA JOB
IN ICELAND

07:37.958 --> 07:39.893
BECAUSE THE HEAT WAS MAKING
HER HAIR LIFELESS.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.228
- AND NOW, WITH JUST TWO OF US,

07:41.294 --> 07:43.964
OUR POOL ENTRANCES LACK FLAIR
AND INTIMIDATION.

07:44.031 --> 07:45.533
- IT'S LIKE A PIECE OF US
IS MISSING.

07:45.599 --> 07:46.867
- THE MIDDLE PIECE.

07:46.934 --> 07:49.436
[both sobbing]

07:49.537 --> 07:51.238
- OKAY.
THERE, THERE.

07:51.304 --> 07:52.706
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

07:54.274 --> 07:55.709
- HEY, YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

07:55.776 --> 07:57.711
YOU'RE THE SAME HEIGHT
AS THE OLD JENNIFER.

07:57.778 --> 08:00.614
- ARE YOU THINKING
WHAT I'M THINKING?

08:14.762 --> 08:17.030
- WHO WANTS A SNOW CONE?

08:17.097 --> 08:18.666
- OKAY, MOVE IT.
COME ON, SHOO.

08:18.732 --> 08:20.333
GET OUT OF THE WAY.

08:20.400 --> 08:22.035
- WHAT'S THE BIG IDEA?

08:22.102 --> 08:24.572
- YOUR RENTAL CONTRACT
SPECIFICALLY PROHIBITS YOU

08:24.605 --> 08:27.675
FROM OPERATING A FOOD STAND
ON PALM WOODS PROPERTY.

08:27.741 --> 08:29.943
- OH, PLEASE.
JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT.

08:30.010 --> 08:33.614
- FINE, I WANT 50% OF ALL FUTURE
SHAVED ICE PROFITS

08:33.681 --> 08:36.316
AND A THREE-PICTURE DEAL
ONCE YOU BUY YOUR MOVIE STUDIO.

08:36.383 --> 08:37.718
- NEVER GONNA HAPPEN.

08:37.785 --> 08:40.320
- FINE.
BOYS, TAKE IT AWAY.

08:44.892 --> 08:46.960
HAVE A PALM WOODS DAY.

08:52.232 --> 08:53.801
- OH.

08:53.867 --> 08:56.069
YOU KNOW, KATIE, IF I LEARNED
ONE THING IN BUSINESS SCHOOL,

08:56.136 --> 08:58.138
IT'S THAT YOU CAN
GET OUT OF ANY CONTRACT.

08:58.205 --> 08:59.940
- YOU WENT TO BUSINESS SCHOOL?

09:00.007 --> 09:01.709
- DOES A T-BOND'S VALUE MOVE

09:01.775 --> 09:04.011
IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION
OF ITS YIELD?

09:04.077 --> 09:05.613
- DUDE, I'M TEN.

09:05.679 --> 09:08.515
ALL I KNOW IS THAT BITTERS
JUST JACKED MY BLENDER.

09:08.616 --> 09:10.851
- MMM.
I CAN GET YOU A BLENDER.

09:10.918 --> 09:14.955
IN FACT, I CAN GET YOU
THE ICE GRINDER Z-5000.

09:15.022 --> 09:16.890
- WHAT'S THAT?
- MY WOOD CHIPPER.

09:16.957 --> 09:18.458
ON HOT DAYS,
I FILL IT FULL OF ICE

09:18.525 --> 09:21.061
AND THEN TURN IT ON MYSELF
AND PRETEND I'M SKIING.

09:21.128 --> 09:24.031
[making swooshing noises]

09:28.535 --> 09:30.070
- JAMES!

09:30.137 --> 09:33.073
[driving electronic music]

09:33.140 --> 09:40.981
* *

10:03.603 --> 10:05.472
I CAN'T BELIEVE I MISSED.

10:05.538 --> 10:07.240
[all yelling]

10:08.541 --> 10:09.643
[chuckles]

10:09.710 --> 10:12.245
LOOKS LIKE YOU GUYS
BEAT THE HEAT.

10:12.312 --> 10:13.180
UGH.

10:17.084 --> 10:18.485
- GUITAR DUDE.

10:18.551 --> 10:20.620
JAMES HAS HOLLYWOOD FEVER
AND IS ADDICTED TO TANNING.

10:20.688 --> 10:21.855
HAVE YOU SEEN HIM?

10:21.922 --> 10:24.391
- HAVE YOU SEEN YOURSELF?

10:24.457 --> 10:26.894
I MEAN, I KNOW IT'S HOT OUT,
BUT YOU NEED TO CHILL OUT.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.195
- NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

10:28.261 --> 10:29.930
JAMES LOOKS LOOKS REALLY STUPID.

10:29.997 --> 10:34.234
- WELL, HEY, MAN, IF TANNING'S
HIS THING, WELL, THAT'S COOL.

10:34.301 --> 10:37.070
LET JAMES BE JAMES.

10:37.137 --> 10:41.574
* LET JAMES BE JAMES *

10:41.641 --> 10:43.043
GRAB A BONGO, DUDE.

10:43.110 --> 10:46.013
- LOOK, I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO PLAY WITH BONGOS.

10:46.079 --> 10:49.783
- HEY, MAN, YOU CAN RUSH AROUND
TRYING TO FIND SOMEONE

10:49.850 --> 10:55.823
THAT DOESN'T WANT TO BE FOUND,
OR YOU CAN FIND LOGAN.

10:55.889 --> 10:59.326
- FIND LOGAN.

10:59.392 --> 11:02.796
[banging on bongos]

11:02.863 --> 11:05.866
- HOW DOES THAT FEEL?

11:05.933 --> 11:07.167
- IT FEELS GOOD.

11:07.234 --> 11:09.136
- * LET JAMES BE JAMES *

11:09.202 --> 11:11.204
* DON'T PLAY THOSE GAMES *

11:11.271 --> 11:13.406
both: * LET JAMES BE JAMES *

11:13.473 --> 11:16.810
* LET JAMES BE JAMES *

11:16.877 --> 11:18.311
- I DON'T KNOW, GUYS.

11:18.378 --> 11:21.982
I MEAN, I'M NOT SURE I'M READY
TO BE A JENNIFER.

11:22.049 --> 11:25.252
I MEAN, I'M NICE.

11:25.318 --> 11:28.255
- RIGHT, AS IN PEOPLE
WALK ALL OVER YOU.

11:28.321 --> 11:31.158
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU SANG
LEAD IN ONE OF YOUR SONGS?

11:31.224 --> 11:33.026
- WELL, NEVER, BUT--

11:33.093 --> 11:35.028
- AND WHAT ABOUT YOUR DRESSING
ROOM AT YOUR STUDIO?

11:35.095 --> 11:36.463
YOU DO HAVE YOUR OWN, RIGHT?

11:36.529 --> 11:38.331
- WELL, WE KEEP OUR STUFF
IN A DUFFEL BAG.

11:38.398 --> 11:41.068
- LOOK,
HOLLYWOOD IS LIKE A FISH TANK,

11:41.134 --> 11:44.371
AND YOU'RE EITHER A MINNOW
OR A PIRANHA.

11:44.437 --> 11:47.374
- CARLOS, A LITTLE HELP HERE!

11:47.440 --> 11:48.675
- KEEP TALKING.

11:48.776 --> 11:50.643
- THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO MAKE IT
IN THIS TOWN

11:50.778 --> 11:54.815
ARE THE ONES WHO ARE MEAN,
SELFISH, AND IN IT TO WIN IT.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.822
I WANT TO BE A PIRANHA.

12:01.889 --> 12:04.324

12:24.912 --> 12:26.146
UNBELIEVABLE!

12:26.213 --> 12:28.481

12:28.548 --> 12:30.483
YOU'RE LOOKING A LITTLE PALE.

12:30.550 --> 12:31.651
TANNING POWERS GO!

12:31.718 --> 12:36.223

JAMES, THE TANNING!

12:36.289 --> 12:38.391
[phone ringing]

12:38.458 --> 12:41.061

OUR LITTLE PROBLEM.

12:41.128 --> 12:42.830

13:06.119 --> 13:08.856

WORDS TO SAY *

13:08.856 --> 13:11.724
- KENDALL, CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A MINUTE?

13:11.859 --> 13:13.560
JUST A QUICK MINUTE.

13:13.626 --> 13:14.627
ALL RIGHT.

13:19.532 --> 13:21.668
WHAT IS GOING ON?
- I DON'T KNOW.

13:21.734 --> 13:24.204
CARLOS, LOGAN, AND I WERE TRYING
TO WASH OFF ORANGE JAMES,

13:24.271 --> 13:26.106
AND THEN THINGS
JUST KIND OF SNOWBALLED.

13:26.173 --> 13:29.442
- WELL, YOU ARE KIND OF
THE LEADER OF THIS BAND,

13:29.509 --> 13:32.479
SO KIND OF FIX IT!

13:32.545 --> 13:35.482

BUT THE BAND'S NEW NAME
IS CARLOS AND THE RUSH.

13:49.629 --> 13:52.165

[bongo music]

13:55.235 --> 13:58.238

AND HOP ABOARD THE LOGAN TRAIN--
WHOO-WHOO--

14:01.641 --> 14:03.343

FOR EVERYBODY?

14:19.792 --> 14:22.662
[all screaming]

14:27.434 --> 14:29.469
- THEY'VE GOT THE FEVER,
AND IT'S BAD.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.504
- AND THIS HEAT IS ONLY MAKING
THEIR SYMPTOMS WORSE.

14:31.571 --> 14:32.805
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

14:32.940 --> 14:34.307
YOU GUYS KNOW
ABOUT HOLLYWOOD FEVER?

14:34.374 --> 14:38.111
- IT'S BROKEN UP NEARLY
EVERY ONE OF MY BANDS.

14:38.178 --> 14:41.181
IT STARTS WITH TANNING
OR BONGOS.

14:41.248 --> 14:43.816
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, THEY QUIT
TO START MOVIE CAREERS

14:43.951 --> 14:45.618
OR THEY MOVE TO CANADA
TO LIVE AMONG THE MOOSE.

14:45.685 --> 14:47.287
BOYQUAKE.

14:47.354 --> 14:49.456
- WE HAVE GOT TO SNAP THEM OUT
OF THIS BEFORE IT IS PERMANENT.

14:49.522 --> 14:51.458
- WE MUST DIVIDE AND CONQUER.

14:51.524 --> 14:55.162
KENDALL, YOU TAKE BONGO BOY
AND DRUM SOME SENSE INTO HIM.

14:55.228 --> 14:59.632
KELLY, FIND CARLOS AND REMIND
HIM THAT HE'S NOT A JENNIFER!

14:59.699 --> 15:03.070
AND I AM GETTING A SHRINK
FOR JAMES.

15:05.138 --> 15:08.008
[ice grinding]

15:15.983 --> 15:18.818
- NO. NO. NO. GET.

15:18.885 --> 15:21.054
I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU
YOU COULDN'T SELL FOOD

15:21.121 --> 15:22.689
ON PALM WOODS PROPERTY.

15:22.755 --> 15:25.658
I'M NOT ON PALM WOODS PROPERTY.

15:25.725 --> 15:28.428
- SHE'S ABOVE IT.
OOH.

15:34.201 --> 15:37.237
- WELL PLAYED, MY FRIEND.
WELL PLAYED.

15:37.304 --> 15:41.074
BUT MARK MY WORDS:
I'LL DESTROY YOU AND THIS STAND.

15:41.141 --> 15:43.576
[maniacal laughter]

15:43.643 --> 15:45.778
I'LL GIVE YOU 100 BUCKS
FOR THE WHOLE OPERATION.

15:45.845 --> 15:49.082
- 500, AND I KEEP
THE FRANCHISE RIGHTS.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.436
- TYLER, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO

16:09.502 --> 16:12.039
IS TAP INTO THE OLD LOGAN'S
LOVE OF MATH.

16:12.039 --> 16:15.408
THEN HE TRADES IN HIS
BONGO RHYTHMS FOR LOGARITHMS.

16:15.475 --> 16:18.178
- AND BINGO,
NO MORE HOLLYWOOD FEVER.

16:25.218 --> 16:27.954
- HEY, WHAT'S THE HAPS,
LITTLE DUDE?

16:28.055 --> 16:29.889
- LOGAN, I'M CONFUSED.

16:29.956 --> 16:34.161
IF I HAD FIVE APPLES AND I GAVE
TWO TO MY FRIEND CINDY,

16:34.227 --> 16:38.265
HOW MANY WOULD I HAVE LEFT?

16:38.331 --> 16:40.267
- IT DOESN'T MATTER, DUDE.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.069
YOU STILL HAVE SOME APPLES,
RIGHT?

16:42.102 --> 16:45.805
AND CINDY,
SHE HAS SOME APPLES TOO.

16:45.872 --> 16:47.374
- YOU KNOW, HE'S GOT A POINT.

16:47.440 --> 16:48.575
[bongo music]

16:48.641 --> 16:49.742
BUT DARN IT!

16:53.546 --> 16:54.481
- [snarls]

16:57.250 --> 16:59.986
- JAMES'S NEED TO COVER HIMSELF
WITH TANNING SPRAY

17:00.087 --> 17:02.589
IS AN ATTEMPT TO COUNTER
HIS FEELINGS OF ESTRANGEMENT

17:02.655 --> 17:05.858
BROUGHT ON BY HIS NEW AND
INTENSE HOLLYWOOD ENVIRONMENT.

17:05.925 --> 17:08.095
- YEAH, NO.

17:08.128 --> 17:11.498
HE'S NUTS...

17:11.564 --> 17:13.166
AND ORANGE.

17:13.233 --> 17:14.534
- DON'T WORRY.

17:14.601 --> 17:17.170
I'VE CURED MANY STARS
OF HOLLYWOOD FEVER.

17:17.237 --> 17:18.538
BEFORE HE CAME TO ME,

17:18.605 --> 17:20.640
TAYLOR LAUTNER REFUSED
TO LEAVE HIS HOUSE

17:20.707 --> 17:22.109
WITHOUT HIS SOCK MONKEY.

17:30.117 --> 17:34.187
I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN KISSED
BY THE SUN.

17:34.254 --> 17:37.490
- WORK IT, DOC!
YOU LOOK TAN-TASTIC!

17:37.557 --> 17:41.294
- STOP BEING ORANGE!

17:41.361 --> 17:44.231
[both yelling]

17:47.500 --> 17:49.001
- HEY, CARLOS.

17:49.136 --> 17:51.804
- KELLY,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

17:51.871 --> 17:56.509
- CARE TO TRY OUT MY NEW
SHOPPING CART SLINGSHOT?

18:03.583 --> 18:05.585
- CARE TO TRY OUT MY FORGET IT?

18:05.652 --> 18:07.987

18:08.054 --> 18:10.190
- IT DOES LOOK REALLY COOL,

18:10.257 --> 18:13.560
- LAST CHANCE.
I'M GETTING IN.

18:15.962 --> 18:18.665
CARLOS, GET IN THE CART!
YOU'VE GOT HOLLYWOOD FEVER!

18:18.731 --> 18:21.668

18:23.736 --> 18:25.605

18:33.413 --> 18:39.018
- OKAY, HOLLYWOOD FEVER
PROGRESS CHECK.

18:39.085 --> 18:41.188
WE HAVE MADE NO PROGRESS.

18:41.254 --> 18:43.055
- HOW COME ALL OF YOUR FRIENDS
GOT HOLLYWOOD FEVER

18:43.190 --> 18:44.056
AND YOU DIDN'T?

18:44.191 --> 18:46.993
- BECAUSE HE HAS A NORMAL BRAIN,

18:47.059 --> 18:51.898
AND HIS FRIENDS
HAVE THE BRAIN OF A CRICKET.

18:51.964 --> 18:56.369
NEW PLAN.
KENDALL, YOU ARE GOING SOLO.

18:56.436 --> 18:58.238

NO WAY.

18:58.305 --> 19:00.340
LOOK, THEY MAY JUST BE
A SINGING GROUP TO YOU,

19:00.407 --> 19:03.109
BUT THEY'RE MY BEST FRIENDS.

19:03.210 --> 19:06.413
NOW I'M GONNA GO DO
WHAT I ALWAYS DO WHEN YOU,

19:06.479 --> 19:09.349
THIS TOWN, AND THIS HEAT
GET TO ME.

19:09.416 --> 19:12.452
I'M HITTING THE RINK
TO FIGURE THINGS OUT.

19:12.519 --> 19:14.821
- WAIT, THE RINK?

19:14.887 --> 19:17.290
- YEAH, THE ICE AND THE COLD
HELP ME CLEAR MY HEAD

19:17.357 --> 19:19.526
AND REMIND ME
OF WHERE I CAME FROM.

19:19.592 --> 19:21.861
- SAY THAT LAST PART AGAIN.

19:21.928 --> 19:26.233
- THE ICE AND COLD REMIND ME
OF WHERE I CAME FROM.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.370
- WHY ARE YOU
LOOKING AT EACH OTHER

19:30.437 --> 19:31.671
AND SAYING THINGS TWICE?

19:31.738 --> 19:32.839
- DON'T YOU SEE?

19:32.905 --> 19:34.774
I NEVER GOT HOLLYWOOD FEVER

19:34.841 --> 19:36.743
BECAUSE I NEVER LOST TOUCH
WITH MY ROOTS.

19:36.809 --> 19:39.479
- AND MAYBE HOLLYWOOD FEVER
IS JUST A FANCY TERM

19:39.546 --> 19:41.648
FOR HOMESICKNESS.

19:41.714 --> 19:45.352
- GET THE DOGS
TO THE ICE RINK NOW!

19:45.418 --> 19:47.787
- I COULDN'T GET CARLOS TO TRY
A SLINGSHOT SHOPPING CART.

19:47.854 --> 19:49.256
YOU WANT ME TO GET HIM
TO AN ICE RINK?

19:49.289 --> 19:50.357
- [yells]

19:50.423 --> 19:53.526
- WHAT IF WE BRING THE ICE
TO THEM?

19:53.593 --> 19:54.461
- OOH.

19:56.629 --> 19:59.165
