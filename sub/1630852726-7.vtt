WEBVTT

00:03.960 --> 00:08.312
Now, what if I seat Stan
next to Greg?

00:08.356 --> 00:11.228
It's aggressive,
it's bold, and I love it.

00:11.272 --> 00:14.318
Francine, may I just say,
using custom chess pieces

00:14.362 --> 00:15.711
to plan a dinner party...

00:15.754 --> 00:17.278
I'm having the time of my life.

00:17.321 --> 00:18.801
Well, I'm not.

00:18.844 --> 00:20.629
No matter how I play it out,

00:20.672 --> 00:22.848
three or four moves
down the line,

00:22.892 --> 00:25.286
Klaus ruins my party
by talking about

00:25.329 --> 00:28.202
Dan Bilzerian
or 3-D printed guns

00:28.245 --> 00:30.030
or something else douchey.

00:30.073 --> 00:31.814
I need to go deeper.

00:31.857 --> 00:33.903
Horse tranquilizer,
m'lady?

00:42.694 --> 00:44.957
Oookay!

00:45.001 --> 00:47.047
Tuttle mingles with you...

00:47.090 --> 00:48.831
Genius move, Francine.

00:48.874 --> 00:50.963
I could see us talkin'
a little dog racing.

00:51.007 --> 00:53.140
But look over here
at Parker Deay.

00:53.183 --> 00:55.881
Parker... Parker...
Who is that?

00:55.925 --> 00:57.666
Screams "Zooka Sharks"
a lot.

00:57.709 --> 00:59.233
The guy who takes
Tinder dates out

00:59.276 --> 01:01.365
for hot-dog dinners
at 7-Eleven?

01:01.409 --> 01:03.324
Love him.
Okay, let's play this out.

01:03.367 --> 01:05.456
Good, good!

01:05.500 --> 01:07.937
Your eyes are sliding around,
so I assume it's working.

01:07.980 --> 01:09.460
Bacon-wrapped dates!

01:09.504 --> 01:12.333
Lava hot and wrapped real loose!

01:13.421 --> 01:15.249
- Where did everyone go?
- They left.

01:15.292 --> 01:17.294
Klaus changed
your Spotify playlist

01:17.338 --> 01:19.775
to a Marc Maron
podcast from 2015.

01:19.818 --> 01:22.560
Ohhh, this one
is classic!

01:22.604 --> 01:25.520
His guest is a comedian
you've never heard of.

01:25.563 --> 01:27.391
Classic!

One second!

02:02.905 --> 02:05.516
Just finishing up
the table assignments!

02:05.560 --> 02:10.434
Greg goes here, Tuttle here,
and Klaus sits here.

02:10.478 --> 02:12.871
He-he-he-he-he.

02:14.830 --> 02:16.875
Welcome to
my dinner party!

02:16.919 --> 02:19.661
It's wonderful to see you
all again.

02:19.704 --> 02:22.881
But maybe some of you don't know
Hayley's friend Nerfer.

02:22.925 --> 02:25.667
Don't just stand there,
introduce yourself.

02:25.710 --> 02:28.365
I'm Nerfer.
I'm Hayley's friend.

02:28.409 --> 02:31.107
I already said that.
What else?

02:31.151 --> 02:33.109
I work at
the Old Spaghetti Factory,

02:33.153 --> 02:35.459
but the new location,
which is pretty hilarious,

02:35.503 --> 02:38.462
because old and new
are opposite words.

02:38.506 --> 02:41.422
Okay, that's enough.
You can listen, too.

02:41.465 --> 02:43.119
Let's eat!

02:44.338 --> 02:47.079
The salad looks delicious.
Nice produce.

02:47.123 --> 02:49.212
- Is this from my store?
- God, no.

02:49.256 --> 02:51.171
But this tomato
looks so familiar.

02:51.214 --> 02:53.477
Look, I didn't steal it
from your store on Tuesday!

02:53.521 --> 02:55.305
Francine, you need
to do something.

02:55.349 --> 02:57.873
Klaus's table is turning
into the damn Last Supper.

02:57.916 --> 03:01.311
You hear "Bermuda Triangle"
and you think "whoa,"

03:01.355 --> 03:03.879
but it really is
a beautiful area.

03:03.922 --> 03:05.837
It's crazy lush.

03:05.881 --> 03:07.317
I never thought
of it that way.

03:07.361 --> 03:09.406
That's so
interesting, Klaus!

03:09.450 --> 03:12.453
The world's a big,
interesting place.

03:12.496 --> 03:14.585
I just try to keep
my eyes open, you know?

03:14.629 --> 03:17.545
Ooh! Would you do your
Will Arnett impression again?

03:17.588 --> 03:20.330
I really shouldn't --
"Oh, come on!"

03:23.246 --> 03:25.161
Is everybody
laughing at Klaus?

03:25.205 --> 03:27.119
No, we're laughing
with Klaus.

03:28.860 --> 03:32.168
So, you dogs are hungry
for laughs?

03:32.212 --> 03:35.432
Well, roll over.
You got a bone coming your way.

03:36.390 --> 03:39.784
Hello.
I'm Mrs. Walrus.

03:39.828 --> 03:41.656
Anyone have any fish for me?

03:42.570 --> 03:44.485
Are those tampons
in your mouth?

03:45.921 --> 03:47.836
Oh, tamp on!

03:54.408 --> 03:56.148
He winked at me, Stan!

03:56.192 --> 03:58.803
That little asshole winked!

03:58.847 --> 04:00.283
- At me!
- Who winked?

04:00.327 --> 04:03.721
Klaus!
He ruined my dinner party!

04:03.765 --> 04:05.854
- He did?
- Of course he did!

04:05.897 --> 04:07.812
He monopolized
every conversation

04:07.856 --> 04:09.466
I tried to butt into!

04:09.510 --> 04:11.729
Well, he's been working
on his people skills.

04:11.773 --> 04:13.862
I think everybody
really likes the new Klaus.

04:13.905 --> 04:16.908
Yeah, I'd like
to "nuke Klaus," too.

04:16.952 --> 04:19.563
All the way
back to the stone age.

04:19.607 --> 04:21.478
Sounds like you're
a little jealous Klaus

04:21.522 --> 04:23.088
got all the attention
at your party.

04:23.132 --> 04:24.655
Oh, yeah?

04:24.699 --> 04:27.745
Well, it sounds like you're
wasting dental floss, you idiot!

04:30.618 --> 04:34.012
I'm sorry I said
you were upset, my love.

04:38.626 --> 04:39.975
Help me out
with something, guys.

04:40.018 --> 04:41.368
Klaus sucks, right?

04:41.411 --> 04:43.500
I'm gonna have to
reluctantly disagree.

04:43.544 --> 04:45.763
Have you talked to him
about early cartoons?

04:45.807 --> 04:47.591
He's super knowledgeable.

04:47.635 --> 04:50.725
He's seen basically
every Pluto short on Disney+.

04:50.768 --> 04:54.511
And all
the Goofy features.

04:58.254 --> 04:59.995
Why's everyone obsessed
with Klaus?

05:00.038 --> 05:02.084
I wouldn't say
"obsessed."

05:02.127 --> 05:04.826
He's just -- I dunno --
likable, I guess.

05:04.869 --> 05:06.915
Have you heard him rap?
He's pretty good.

05:06.958 --> 05:09.787

05:09.831 --> 05:11.485

05:11.528 --> 05:13.487
The guy's
an urban poet.

05:13.530 --> 05:15.576
Nobody likes you, Klaus.

05:15.619 --> 05:18.361
Oh, hey, Francine.
Sick dinner party last night.

05:18.405 --> 05:20.624
I don't know
what all "this" is,

05:20.668 --> 05:22.887
but I want it to stop
right now.

05:22.931 --> 05:25.716
Ah. Stan told me
you were upset.

05:25.760 --> 05:28.415
Look, I know I used to be
a real piece of shit.

05:28.458 --> 05:29.720
Guilty!

05:29.764 --> 05:32.288
But, Francine,
I've grown a lot.

05:32.332 --> 05:35.509
Oh, wow, got
a giant sequoia over here.

05:35.552 --> 05:39.948
All right, Mr. Growth, I'm gonna
throw a real party tomorrow.

05:39.991 --> 05:43.125
A real party
for bad bitches.

05:43.168 --> 05:45.170
We'll see who gets
more attention.

05:47.999 --> 05:50.437
What the
am I looking at?

05:53.309 --> 05:55.703
Now this is a party.

05:55.746 --> 05:58.314
Everyone, give me
your attention!

05:58.358 --> 06:00.490
I think we can all agree

06:00.534 --> 06:02.971
last night's dinner party
was terrible.

06:03.014 --> 06:04.538
Aw, I liked
your dinner party.

06:04.581 --> 06:07.236
No, you didn't, Greg.
I'll tell you what you like.

06:07.279 --> 06:08.846
Keg stands!

06:08.890 --> 06:10.108
No, I'd rather not.

06:10.152 --> 06:11.719
Grab his
other leg, Roger.

06:14.417 --> 06:16.767
Uh-oh!

06:16.811 --> 06:18.421
The tap's broken!

06:18.465 --> 06:20.771
You gotta drink
the whole keg!

06:20.815 --> 06:21.990
It's not broken!

06:22.033 --> 06:23.644
Shut up,
freshman scum!

06:25.080 --> 06:26.951
Ummm, Franny...?

06:28.649 --> 06:30.955
Wow!

06:30.999 --> 06:33.001
Is this mahogany?

06:33.044 --> 06:35.830
Thanks for noticing, Tuttle.
It's not.

06:35.873 --> 06:38.354
Oh, Nerfer, the other night,
you mentioned you like

06:38.398 --> 06:41.270
hoppy IPAs,
so I whipped up a home brew

06:41.313 --> 06:42.880
I think you'll enjoy.

06:42.924 --> 06:44.578
That's hecka posh.

06:44.621 --> 06:47.798
Tuttle, Nerfer,
what the hell?!

06:47.842 --> 06:49.409
This is my party!

06:49.452 --> 06:51.541
You're supposed to be
paying attention to me!

06:51.585 --> 06:53.978
Klaus is more interesting
than you, okay?!

06:54.022 --> 06:55.545
You need to learn
to accept that!

06:55.589 --> 06:58.635
I didn't want to do this,
but you left me no choice.

06:58.679 --> 06:59.941
Gimme those!

07:01.725 --> 07:04.380
Everyone look at me!

07:04.424 --> 07:07.905
The Amah-zing Francine
will attempt

07:07.949 --> 07:12.475
a never-before-seen
roof-to-pool jump!

07:12.519 --> 07:13.737
Is Mom okay?

07:13.781 --> 07:15.522
Oh, yeah,
better than ever.

07:15.565 --> 07:17.698
Women are complicated, Steve.
Don't drink that.

07:17.741 --> 07:19.526
I'm gonna leave.

07:19.569 --> 07:21.049
I'm gonna
take off, too.

07:21.092 --> 07:23.530
Is everyone
okay to drive?

07:23.573 --> 07:25.880
I can call each of you
a vintage Yellow Cab.

07:25.923 --> 07:27.316
Shut up, Klaus!

07:27.359 --> 07:28.883
Nobody's leaving!

07:28.926 --> 07:30.667
I'm about to jump!

07:30.711 --> 07:32.147
3...

07:32.190 --> 07:33.844
2...

07:38.936 --> 07:41.156
Well, at least she still
has her dignity.

07:41.199 --> 07:44.028
I pooped my swimsuit!

07:44.072 --> 07:46.074
I stand by my
previous statement.

07:50.557 --> 07:53.037
Easy now.
You had quite a fall.

07:53.081 --> 07:57.085
I saw them.
My ancestors!

07:57.128 --> 08:00.784
All my dear,
departed loved ones who died.

08:00.828 --> 08:02.351
They spoke to me.

08:02.394 --> 08:04.092
They told me they were
just as confused

08:04.135 --> 08:06.616
as I was
why anybody likes you.

08:06.660 --> 08:08.531
Even the caveman Francine!

08:08.575 --> 08:12.143
People like me because
I work on myself, Francine.

08:12.187 --> 08:13.971
I've been following a strict
lifestyle regimen

08:14.015 --> 08:16.191
developed by Mark Wahlberg.

08:16.234 --> 08:18.367
It forces me
to grow physically,

08:18.410 --> 08:21.979
mentally, spiritually,
metaphysically, metaspiritually,

08:22.023 --> 08:24.939
super-meta-spiri-physi-
tastically!

08:24.982 --> 08:27.463
Okay, I made that one up
as a joke.

08:27.507 --> 08:28.986
I'm funny now, too.

08:29.030 --> 08:32.468
I can't believe I'm asking
you this, but...

08:32.512 --> 08:34.557
will you teach me
how to grow, too?

08:34.601 --> 08:37.473
Of course! Congrats!

08:37.517 --> 08:39.997
You're officially enrolled
in Klaus college,

08:40.041 --> 08:42.086
a satellite campus
of Wahlberg U.

08:46.787 --> 08:49.050
Klaus, it's 2:00 a.m.

08:49.093 --> 08:52.009
You're on
Wahlberg time now.

08:52.053 --> 08:54.795
As you can see,
the schedule is rigorous.

08:54.838 --> 08:57.101
You'll start and end the day
with a 5-mile run.

08:57.145 --> 08:59.669
In between, you'll be
reading self-help books,

08:59.713 --> 09:01.671
meditating,
belting out sea shanties,

09:01.715 --> 09:04.108
learning basic IT,
more shanties,

09:04.152 --> 09:06.546
eating Wahlburgers,
mastering Krav Maga,

09:06.589 --> 09:09.549
and you might even cook
an exotic dish or two.

09:09.592 --> 09:11.072
This is crazy.

09:11.115 --> 09:13.291
There's no way Mark Wahlberg
does all that.

09:13.335 --> 09:14.641
And then some.

09:14.684 --> 09:16.730
He's a big ol' Catholic!

09:16.773 --> 09:19.123

10:12.394 --> 10:14.526
<i>I've had with a woman</i> <i>
at a blackjack table.</i>

10:14.570 --> 10:17.225
<i>Today, we'll be looking</i> <i>

10:17.268 --> 10:20.358

10:20.402 --> 10:23.448
<i>refused to answer the simple</i> <i>
icebreaker question,</i>

10:23.492 --> 10:27.539
<i>"Don't you think it's time</i> <i>
to forgive Kevin Spacey?"</i>

10:27.583 --> 10:29.585
Klaus, where are you?

10:29.629 --> 10:32.370
I'm returning
your self-help books!

10:32.414 --> 10:36.287
I came to my senses
and realize you suck again!

10:43.643 --> 10:45.775
Off-brand soda,

10:45.819 --> 10:48.648
off-brand Maxim magazine,

10:48.691 --> 10:51.041
filthy recliner?

10:51.085 --> 10:53.391
I knew it!

10:53.435 --> 10:55.393
You haven't changed, Klaus!

10:55.437 --> 10:57.700
You're a big phony scumbag!

10:57.744 --> 10:59.484
Oh, hi, Francine.

10:59.528 --> 11:01.138
Jeffrey, I'm about to reveal

11:01.182 --> 11:02.444
my sinister plan.

11:02.487 --> 11:04.576
Is my fedora
rakishly askew?

11:04.620 --> 11:07.536
It's a strong look,
Mr. Klaus!

11:07.579 --> 11:08.842
I think it's hideous.

11:08.885 --> 11:10.321
Aaaah!

11:14.108 --> 11:16.110
So, what?

11:16.153 --> 11:17.720
You hypnotized Jeff
or something?

11:17.764 --> 11:20.027
Is it that obvious?

11:21.768 --> 11:22.856
I'm over this.

11:22.899 --> 11:23.900
No, wait!

11:23.944 --> 11:26.250
Okay, long story short,

11:26.294 --> 11:29.036
I learned to control people
using a technique

11:29.079 --> 11:31.038
called
"hypnotic anchoring."

11:31.081 --> 11:32.909
Sounds boring,
and I don't get it.

11:32.953 --> 11:35.172
All right.
How do I explain this?

11:35.216 --> 11:36.565
Have you seen the movie <i>
Get Out?</i>

11:36.608 --> 11:38.175
- No.
- Really?

11:38.219 --> 11:39.394
Have you seen <i>Parasite?</i>

11:39.437 --> 11:41.178
- Yeah.
- Good.

11:41.222 --> 11:43.354
Not relevant here,
but I'm glad you saw it.

11:43.398 --> 11:44.747
Bong Joon-ho, man.

11:44.791 --> 11:46.401
So sick.

11:46.444 --> 11:48.882
Anyways, I hypnotized people
to love me.

11:48.925 --> 11:50.840
Take Jeff, for example.

11:50.884 --> 11:53.800
First, I learned all about Jeff.

11:53.843 --> 11:55.976
What makes him "tick,"
so to speak.

11:56.019 --> 11:59.153
And I discovered
that Jeff really likes weed.

11:59.196 --> 12:00.458
I do!

12:00.502 --> 12:03.679
So I filled my notebook
with fun facts and jokes

12:03.723 --> 12:05.594
about marijuana.

12:05.637 --> 12:08.205
Stuff that would
make Jeff smile.

12:08.249 --> 12:10.512
And every time he did...

12:12.035 --> 12:14.777
And after several hundred
of those...

12:14.821 --> 12:16.605
Who do ya love, Jeff?

12:16.648 --> 12:18.476
I love Klaus!

12:18.520 --> 12:23.003
Soon, everyone in town
will think I'm so cool,

12:23.046 --> 12:25.745
they'll be under
my absolute control.

12:25.788 --> 12:29.749
This is bogus, and I'm telling
Stan about your secret lair.

12:29.792 --> 12:34.318
Hypnotizing you was my greatest
challenge, by far.

12:34.362 --> 12:37.844
You resent me so much,
I couldn't crack your psyche.

12:37.887 --> 12:41.412
So I looked to ultimate
mind-bender Mark Wahlberg

12:41.456 --> 12:42.674
for inspiration.

12:42.718 --> 12:44.328
I'm not hypnotized.

12:44.372 --> 12:46.069
Remember this guy?

12:49.943 --> 12:53.207
Now, tell me, Francine...

12:53.250 --> 12:55.644
how do I look?

12:55.687 --> 13:01.606
Klaus, I am loving
your stupid fedora!

13:01.650 --> 13:04.348
Mmm.
A little more hypnosis.

13:13.357 --> 13:14.141
What's happening?!

13:14.184 --> 13:15.838
Francine, you're back!

13:15.882 --> 13:18.623
- W-- Where am I?
- You're in a cowboy tub.

13:18.667 --> 13:21.713
I got us an Airbnb,
far away from Klaus.

13:21.757 --> 13:24.368
Come inside. They've got a ton
of incomplete board games.

13:24.412 --> 13:26.806
You like Trivial Pursuit
without the questions?

13:26.849 --> 13:28.155
Where's the rest
of the family?

13:28.198 --> 13:30.070
Oh, Francine,
it's terrible.

13:30.113 --> 13:31.898
You were right about Klaus
the whole time.

13:31.941 --> 13:34.248
- He hypnotized them all!
- Where are they?

13:34.291 --> 13:35.902
- Are they okay?
- I don't know.

13:35.945 --> 13:38.034
I only had room for one of you
and my luggage.

13:38.078 --> 13:40.907
Roger, we need
to go save them.

13:40.950 --> 13:43.213
It's just the desert is
so hot during the day

13:43.257 --> 13:45.259
and so cold at night,
it's like having to pack

13:45.302 --> 13:47.391
for both the beach
and skiing!

13:47.435 --> 13:49.437
I probably didn't need
the snowboard, though.

13:49.480 --> 13:51.221
That could've been Steve,
I guess.

13:51.265 --> 13:53.267
I guess I could've fit
Hayley, too.

13:53.310 --> 13:54.616
Weird.

13:54.659 --> 13:57.793
I don't remember any
border checkpoints before.

13:58.750 --> 14:00.709
State your business
in Langley Falls.

14:00.752 --> 14:01.884
We live here?

14:01.928 --> 14:03.668
Better let me
handle this, Fran.

14:03.712 --> 14:06.933
Hi, sir! Just so you know,
we love Klaus so much.

14:06.976 --> 14:09.370
Klaus is the best,
is what we say.

14:09.413 --> 14:12.547
The only reason we left Langley
was to spread word of Klaus.

14:12.590 --> 14:15.071
In summary,
we love Klaus.

14:23.906 --> 14:26.039
<i>♪ One, two, three, four</i>♪

14:26.082 --> 14:27.910

14:30.434 --> 14:32.175

14:32.219 --> 14:34.917
Some more?!
That's gross!

14:37.441 --> 14:38.790
You're gross!

14:38.834 --> 14:39.966
Drive, drive!

14:42.055 --> 14:43.926
Did you hear me
call them "gross"?

14:43.970 --> 14:45.319
Was that cool?

14:45.362 --> 14:47.147
I feel like I'm starring
in <i>Jackass!</i>

14:47.190 --> 14:47.974
Watch out!

14:59.942 --> 15:01.726
There are few things
in this world

15:01.770 --> 15:03.859
I hate more
than traveling by foot.

15:05.295 --> 15:07.428

15:40.330 --> 15:42.593
Damn, he's hypnotized everybody.

15:42.637 --> 15:43.812
Be careful, Franny.

15:43.855 --> 15:45.553
People might think
you don't love Klaus.

15:45.596 --> 15:46.771
Who doesn't love Klaus?

15:46.815 --> 15:48.643
- Francine Smith.
- Roger!

15:48.686 --> 15:51.341
Sorry, Franny, but I'm a sucker
for peer pressure.

15:51.385 --> 15:53.430
And the peers
are a-pressurin'.

15:59.306 --> 16:02.091
Klauuuussss!

16:10.665 --> 16:12.449
Guys, I'm back!

16:13.973 --> 16:17.106
Please, Stan, tell me
you haven't fallen for Klaus!

16:17.672 --> 16:23.547
Klaaaaaauuuusss!

16:25.680 --> 16:27.421
There she is!

16:27.464 --> 16:31.077
Thank you, boys, for getting
this menace off our streets.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.559
Where'd pink go?

16:36.908 --> 16:38.867
Help!

16:38.910 --> 16:41.435
Keep it down.
You'll scare the cats.

16:41.478 --> 16:43.959
Sorry for the hood.
I had to tidy up a bit.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.527
Trust me, this place
was a disaster.

16:47.484 --> 16:49.225
You live in the sewers?

16:49.269 --> 16:51.184
It's not safe
up there anymore.

16:51.227 --> 16:53.621
Me and Beezus just looked
at each other one day,

16:53.664 --> 16:56.841
and we knew it was time
to form the Resistance.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.280
So...how's it going?

17:00.323 --> 17:01.585
Pretty good!

17:01.629 --> 17:03.979
I sent a team of cats
to breach Klaus's alcove,

17:04.023 --> 17:06.416
and, boy,
did they deliver.

17:11.943 --> 17:13.554
Boop!

17:13.597 --> 17:15.469
These cats are heroes.

17:15.512 --> 17:18.037
Klaus had entries
for everyone in town.

17:18.080 --> 17:20.996
"Francine Smith --
loves drinking,

17:21.040 --> 17:24.347
jealous streak,
mind-controlled by air horn."

17:24.391 --> 17:26.088
They also found this.

17:26.132 --> 17:27.568
It's a failsafe phrase

17:27.611 --> 17:30.310
to deactivate everyone
Klaus hypnotized!

17:30.353 --> 17:32.921
"Enough with
the hypnotism already."

17:32.964 --> 17:35.706
It's a good one.
Fiendishly simple.

17:35.750 --> 17:37.404
If you can hijack Klaus's
broadcast

17:37.447 --> 17:39.710
and shout that phrase,
you'll save the town.

17:39.754 --> 17:41.756
You can count on me.

17:43.192 --> 17:45.803
I have one more question.

17:45.847 --> 17:47.631
May I play
with your cats?

17:47.675 --> 17:51.287
<i>♪ Karma, karma, karma, karma,</i> <i>
karma chameleon</i>♪

17:51.331 --> 17:58.164
<i>♪ You come and go</i>♪

18:03.734 --> 18:05.258
Roger was right.

18:05.301 --> 18:07.477
Klaus is the perfect subject.

18:07.521 --> 18:09.479
Enough with
the hypnotism already!

18:09.523 --> 18:11.655
You're back!

18:12.743 --> 18:15.006
I'm scared, Mom.

18:15.050 --> 18:16.834
Why was I painting Klaus?

18:16.878 --> 18:19.315
Because Klaus is
mind-controlling everyone

18:19.359 --> 18:22.144
from the TV studio
in his alcove.

18:22.188 --> 18:26.453
He's ruined the entire town,
and we're gonna stop him.

18:27.584 --> 18:29.499
Enough with
the hypnotism already!

18:29.543 --> 18:30.892
Aah!

18:30.935 --> 18:32.241
That's right, Klaus!

18:32.285 --> 18:34.287
I know how to
deactivate everyone!

18:35.375 --> 18:37.290
Code twenty-niner
in the Alcove.

18:37.333 --> 18:38.900
Stan, what are you doing?

18:38.943 --> 18:40.510
Calling for backup.

18:40.554 --> 18:43.687
No offense, honey, but hypnosis
showed me how cool Klaus is.

18:43.731 --> 18:46.125
Honestly, he deserves
to be dictator of Langley.

18:46.168 --> 18:49.258
Klaaaaaauuuusss!

18:49.302 --> 18:52.174
Maybe you should try
thinking Klaus is cool.

18:52.218 --> 18:53.349
You just might
find you like it.

18:53.393 --> 18:55.177
Why isn't this working?

18:55.221 --> 18:59.225
You broke the hypnosis,
but you're too late.

18:59.268 --> 19:03.794
The belief in "cool Klaus"
is buried way too deep.

19:03.838 --> 19:05.796
You lost, Francine.

19:05.840 --> 19:07.189
Join the mob.

19:07.233 --> 19:08.843
Come on!

19:08.886 --> 19:11.454
I can't make them forget
that he's cool.

19:11.498 --> 19:16.764
But what if I can make everyone
remember he's not cool?

19:16.807 --> 19:17.895
Capture her, Stan!

19:22.073 --> 19:24.902
Enough with
the hypnotism already!

19:27.514 --> 19:32.214
Even if they're not hypnotized,
they're still gonna love me.

19:32.258 --> 19:35.174
I'm just getting
warmed up, punk.

19:35.217 --> 19:37.263
Thanks to Mark Wahlberg,

19:37.306 --> 19:40.570
I'm now kind of trained
in basic IT.

19:42.964 --> 19:45.836
