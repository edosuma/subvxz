01:41.226 --> 01:42.352
Hallå?

01:44.188 --> 01:45.189
Hallå?

01:52.446 --> 01:53.447
Hallå?

04:05.329 --> 04:06.455
Easy.

04:10.918 --> 04:11.919
Where'd you come from?

04:27.392 --> 04:28.894
See this? Go get it.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.447
He should've been here.

05:23.073 --> 05:25.534
You heard the recording.
When else could it have been?

05:26.118 --> 05:28.704
I don't know. I don't know
what I heard anymore.

05:29.580 --> 05:30.789
What am I supposed to do now?

05:38.380 --> 05:40.382
This is where you live now.

05:41.133 --> 05:42.551
That was my place in grad school.

05:42.634 --> 05:44.011
This is where you work.

05:44.970 --> 05:46.763
I'm a "mechanical technician"?

05:46.847 --> 05:48.765
You'll find out when you show up tomorrow.

05:50.058 --> 05:51.059
I can't do that.

05:51.143 --> 05:54.271
You have to. If you do not go home
or you do not go to work,

05:54.354 --> 05:56.106
whoever is expecting you,
they will call the police.

05:56.190 --> 05:58.358
And when you try to tell them
what happened to you,

05:58.442 --> 05:59.484
they will not believe you.

05:59.568 --> 06:01.320
They'll take you to the hospital.

06:01.403 --> 06:02.529
Did that happen to you?

06:05.365 --> 06:06.867
This is who you are now.

06:08.160 --> 06:09.912
This is who you have to be.

06:09.995 --> 06:13.498
You can do this. I have many times.

06:15.959 --> 06:17.878
-Where are you going?
-It's gonna be okay.

06:30.182 --> 06:31.475
Can I help you?

06:33.227 --> 06:34.478
Is Dan Velazquez here?

06:35.145 --> 06:37.189
I'm sorry. I don't know who that is.

06:37.272 --> 06:38.398
He lives here.

06:38.482 --> 06:40.275
He doesn't anymore. Sorry.

06:41.527 --> 06:44.404
How long have you lived here? I'll leave.
Just tell me how long.

06:44.905 --> 06:45.906
A few years.

06:45.989 --> 06:47.616
-Do you get mail?
-Yeah.

06:47.699 --> 06:51.203
No, something from the previous owner.
Letters, bills, anything like that?

06:51.286 --> 06:53.705
No, I didn't keep some random guy's bills.

06:55.290 --> 06:56.291
Is that all?

06:57.417 --> 06:58.418
Yeah.

07:29.658 --> 07:30.659
Hello?

07:31.159 --> 07:33.871
Hey. is Rachel there?

07:33.954 --> 07:34.955
Who?

08:15.120 --> 08:16.663
Morning, Kirby.

08:22.544 --> 08:25.088
Sorry. I was working late,
and I crashed here.

08:25.797 --> 08:26.924
Okay.

08:54.326 --> 08:58.705
No, I don't think-- What? Yeah, I…

08:58.789 --> 08:59.790
Kirby.

09:01.542 --> 09:03.669
I know your clips took forever,
but I have them.

09:03.752 --> 09:06.213
I promise. The Berwyn robberies. Here.

09:15.138 --> 09:16.139
Right. Thank you.

09:16.640 --> 09:18.267
Mind if I take this back?

09:18.350 --> 09:19.351
Of course.

09:26.358 --> 09:27.442
Morning, Kirby.

09:41.832 --> 09:44.126
-Hey, where's Dan?
-Who?

09:46.837 --> 09:50.340
Did you contact CPD
about the Klara Meiser police report?

09:50.424 --> 09:53.010
"Meiser"? I don't remember that.

09:53.510 --> 09:55.012
The background on Julia Madrigal.

09:55.095 --> 09:57.389
Wait-- "Meiser,"
that's the suspect's name?

09:57.472 --> 10:00.350
I thought it was something else.
Yeah, Pawel Banik.

10:00.434 --> 10:02.477
The DA's expecting
to finalize the plea this week.

10:03.145 --> 10:04.479
The-- He's pleading guilty?

10:04.563 --> 10:07.274
He got a good deal.
The police just wanted to close it up.

10:07.357 --> 10:08.442
What about the other women?

10:09.401 --> 10:10.485
Have you heard something else?

10:10.569 --> 10:13.030
-Does Banik have other victims?
-No, it isn't him.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.114
What do you mean?

10:15.115 --> 10:17.618
There are other women.
Why-- Are we not covering it?

10:18.368 --> 10:20.037
Abby's already in there, guys.

10:21.788 --> 10:24.833
Whatever lead you have,
you should probably bring it up.

10:27.753 --> 10:29.421
Kirby, you coming?

10:42.768 --> 10:44.520
Jeff, I want you on postgame at Wrigley.

10:44.603 --> 10:46.980
Yeah, I can probably cover both,
depending on traffic.

10:47.064 --> 10:48.315
Okay. Yeah, that's better.

10:49.775 --> 10:52.110
And where are you two
on the flood follow-up?

10:52.194 --> 10:54.446
We're waiting to hear back
from the insurance companies.

10:54.530 --> 10:56.532
It looks like they're gonna
deny the claims.

10:56.615 --> 10:58.450
I've got the rundown
on last night's homicides.

11:00.244 --> 11:03.288
All right. Raise your hand if anyone
wants to jump in on any of these.

11:03.789 --> 11:06.625
"Greg Hunnam, domestic dispute,
North Halsted.

11:06.708 --> 11:10.712
Arthur Morris, gunshot victim
at Booster and Fairfax.

11:11.213 --> 11:12.589
Likely gang-related."

11:12.673 --> 11:15.300
-I'll take that one.
-All right, who's next?

11:15.384 --> 11:16.760
"Dan Velazquez"?

11:16.844 --> 11:18.428
No fucking way. Dan?

11:21.640 --> 11:23.141
-What?
-What happened?

11:23.225 --> 11:24.935
-Who's he?
-Dan used to work here.

11:27.855 --> 11:29.898
I brought him over from The Observer.

11:29.982 --> 11:31.441
Most of you probably don't know him.

11:37.447 --> 11:38.740
Well, that's just wrong.

11:38.824 --> 11:40.909
Abby, where did it happen?

11:41.785 --> 11:43.161
Some bar. "Sid's."

11:43.745 --> 11:45.038
No, that's wrong.

11:45.122 --> 11:47.624
I've seen shows there.
It's near Uptown Square.

11:48.333 --> 11:49.459
Kirby, are you okay?

11:50.586 --> 11:51.587
Did you know him?

12:21.658 --> 12:22.659
Kirby.

12:25.829 --> 12:27.122
Kirby?

12:28.332 --> 12:29.333
You okay?

12:36.673 --> 12:40.010
Else… wouldn't have

12:41.011 --> 12:45.224
Gone so far from me

12:53.941 --> 12:54.942
Harper.

12:58.695 --> 13:00.489
I picked a good day. You remember me.

13:00.572 --> 13:03.450
What do you mean? I always remember you.

13:05.285 --> 13:06.328
Listen…

13:09.289 --> 13:10.749
I need you to talk to me.

13:13.669 --> 13:19.424
Clear. None of the
horseshit about the lights.

13:20.592 --> 13:24.471
They're always there.
You would talk about them too.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.642
You talk to people about Klara?

13:35.148 --> 13:36.149
Who?

13:37.359 --> 13:38.360
You know.

13:41.238 --> 13:42.489
You know who I'm talking about.

13:45.242 --> 13:46.368
Right.

13:47.619 --> 13:50.706
Right, the dancer from the tape?

14:00.007 --> 14:01.008
What about the tape?

14:02.092 --> 14:03.093
I--

14:04.511 --> 14:07.181
It reminded you too much of Paris.

14:08.682 --> 14:09.683
Is it here?

14:11.351 --> 14:12.603
You give it to them?

14:20.569 --> 14:22.738
-What are you looking for?
-The tape.

14:24.364 --> 14:27.284
The one you took from me.
The one with Klara.

14:27.367 --> 14:28.410
Who?

14:28.493 --> 14:30.621
No, no. Don't start with that.
That's why I came today.

14:30.704 --> 14:31.955
Today is a good day.

14:33.290 --> 14:34.416
I know it is.

14:35.501 --> 14:37.669
What do you want from me?
I don't have your tape.

14:38.462 --> 14:41.465
Yes. Yes, you do. You do.
I know you have it.

14:44.510 --> 14:46.053
And you're gonna give it to someone.

14:47.137 --> 14:48.805
And that's how they find me.

14:49.389 --> 14:52.601
So… I know that you have it.

14:55.771 --> 14:59.107
If I do, I don't know where it is.

15:13.330 --> 15:14.414
Fucking here.

15:15.791 --> 15:17.584
Okay. Okay, Leo.

15:19.002 --> 15:20.170
Hey, look at me.

15:21.463 --> 15:22.464
Hey.

15:23.924 --> 15:27.761
You just need to remember.
That's all. Just remember.

15:29.012 --> 15:31.390
Then take me back to the house.

15:33.934 --> 15:34.977
I'll be better there.

15:35.060 --> 15:36.061
You know…

15:38.689 --> 15:40.023
you're doing fine here.

15:41.400 --> 15:42.401
You are.

15:45.153 --> 15:47.573
You only need to think for a minute.
Just for a minute.

15:48.532 --> 15:51.201
Where is it? Where's the tape?

15:59.376 --> 16:01.962
Harper? When did you get here?

16:13.765 --> 16:14.766
What happened?

16:17.227 --> 16:18.228
Dan's dead.

16:22.733 --> 16:23.984
That's why it wasn't you.

16:27.154 --> 16:29.448
I went through everything
I own last night.

16:29.531 --> 16:31.533
You went to that address on the ID?

16:32.034 --> 16:34.119
It's the same place
I lived in grad school.

16:34.786 --> 16:37.080
But now I'm supposed to have dropped out

16:37.164 --> 16:40.709
on May 15th, 1986,
the day of your assault.

16:42.503 --> 16:43.629
How do you know that?

16:43.712 --> 16:46.548
I went through photos, books, clothes.

16:46.632 --> 16:48.634
It's all the same until that day.

16:50.093 --> 16:52.387
Do you remember
what I told you about particles?

16:52.471 --> 16:54.056
How sometimes they can become entangled,

16:54.139 --> 16:56.642
like there's a thread running
through them, connecting them?

16:58.644 --> 17:01.021
Now I think there's
three of us on that thread.

17:02.856 --> 17:04.233
How do we get off of it?

17:04.900 --> 17:07.944
Maybe if you remove one of the particles,

17:08.028 --> 17:09.488
the rest can break free.

17:10.489 --> 17:11.615
And then what happens?

17:12.824 --> 17:15.368
He might be the one who's connecting us.

17:16.286 --> 17:18.204
So I don't know what'll happen.

17:22.166 --> 17:24.627
I don't wanna feel this way anymore.

17:27.172 --> 17:29.800
So I don't care what happens next.

17:36.181 --> 17:37.558
You remember where you're going?

17:40.352 --> 17:41.603
I was following you.

17:41.687 --> 17:43.939
-Then why are you ahead of me?
-What do you mean?

17:45.315 --> 17:46.441
Are we close?

17:48.318 --> 17:49.319
Very close.

18:00.372 --> 18:01.373
Holy shit.

18:03.041 --> 18:04.042
They're gone.

18:05.711 --> 18:07.129
Goddamn, Harp.

18:08.589 --> 18:09.631
I can't see the lights.

18:09.715 --> 18:12.092
Good.
I don't have to hear about them anymore.

18:12.176 --> 18:15.179
What's all this? You picked up
even more junk, huh?

18:16.597 --> 18:18.807
-How long you been here now?
-I'm not too sure.

18:20.017 --> 18:22.811
Where's the tape? What'd you do with it?

18:22.895 --> 18:24.104
You ever go back?

18:24.605 --> 18:27.107
-Watch any White Sox games?
-Where'd you hide the tape?

18:27.733 --> 18:29.359
You already give it to someone?

18:29.443 --> 18:31.111
That's all I want.

18:31.778 --> 18:35.282
Go back, watch Cicotte, Jackson,

18:35.824 --> 18:37.618
-you know.
-Leo, shut the fuck up!

18:40.621 --> 18:41.872
Where's the tape?

18:44.458 --> 18:45.584
You know me.

18:46.251 --> 18:50.130
You know that I won't tell anyone
about you, about the house.

18:50.964 --> 18:52.216
I don't want anything.

18:52.716 --> 18:55.302
I just want what I had. Take me back.

18:55.802 --> 18:58.138
That can't happen,
and you know that.

19:03.519 --> 19:04.686
Still won't work for you.

19:07.397 --> 19:08.398
Never will.

19:17.533 --> 19:19.201
Then you do it. Open the door.

19:19.284 --> 19:20.702
I can't do that.

19:21.620 --> 19:22.621
Fucking open it!

19:22.704 --> 19:24.081
-I just wanna go home!
-Get your hands off.

19:24.164 --> 19:27.668
I just wanna go home. I wanna go home!
Open it!

19:27.751 --> 19:29.294
-Open it!
-Or what?

19:30.462 --> 19:32.965
I can hit back. I'm not Klara.

19:33.674 --> 19:36.718
-You piece of shit.
-Fuck.

19:39.429 --> 19:40.556
When we dumped her,

19:40.639 --> 19:44.268
you told me she was gonna
tell everyone about the house.

19:44.351 --> 19:45.727
I knew you were lying.

19:45.811 --> 19:48.814
You left the fucking tape.
You didn't think I'd find it?

19:48.897 --> 19:51.316
I thought the house took it.
Things just disappear here.

19:51.400 --> 19:53.652
-Yeah, right in my pocket, you dumb fuck.
-I need it, Leo.

19:53.735 --> 19:56.071
Oh, please.
You want it because you're all over it.

19:56.154 --> 19:58.156
Your voice, your house, Klara.

19:58.240 --> 20:01.326
Someone found you with that tape.
Anybody else could too.

20:01.410 --> 20:04.830
But I don't care about the fucking tape,
okay? You can have it.

20:05.372 --> 20:08.750
We're gonna go back together,
back to the day that we found this place.

20:08.834 --> 20:10.961
Then I will tell you where it is.
I'll tell you.

20:11.044 --> 20:12.629
I don't need to do that.

20:12.713 --> 20:14.506
I can just come back to today,

20:15.841 --> 20:20.762
and we can do this all over again,
however many times that we need to.

20:20.846 --> 20:24.349
You tried that with Klara.
She saw through you. I will too.

20:24.850 --> 20:28.395
I know why you don't wanna go back.
Because you have nothing there.

20:29.062 --> 20:31.690
There's nothing behind you.
There's nothing ahead of you.

20:32.191 --> 20:36.653
That's why you'll never leave this house.
Because no one wants you anywhere else.

21:28.497 --> 21:31.875
The Black Lions fought at Vietnam,
but they could be in earlier wars.

21:32.709 --> 21:34.711
You're sure that's the tattoo
you saw on him?

21:34.795 --> 21:36.296
Can you call any regiment clubs?

21:36.380 --> 21:38.882
See if there are local chapters.
Then we can-- Hey.

21:40.759 --> 21:41.969
What?

21:46.014 --> 21:47.057
What?

21:48.851 --> 21:49.893
Everyone's different.

21:51.979 --> 21:53.105
It happened again.

21:56.942 --> 21:59.194
-Just get as many records as you can.
-Okay.

22:07.786 --> 22:09.121
Hey, Kirby. What's up?

22:10.956 --> 22:12.082
Can I ask you a random question?

22:12.958 --> 22:13.959
Always.

22:14.626 --> 22:17.004
-You served in Vietnam, right?
-Yeah, that's right.

22:17.087 --> 22:19.047
The 28th Regiment,
do you know who they are?

22:19.131 --> 22:21.175
Yeah, of course. They're a big deal.

22:21.258 --> 22:26.513
Would they have fought any earlier?
In Korea or maybe even World War I?

22:27.014 --> 22:28.724
Maybe. They're a legacy regiment.

22:29.683 --> 22:32.102
Would the VA have names of
any locals who fought there?

22:32.853 --> 22:36.064
Not from World War I.
VA's only been around since the '30s.

22:36.148 --> 22:37.900
But I can ask the Legion for some records.

22:37.983 --> 22:40.277
It'll take 'em a few days
to get back to me. How come?

22:40.360 --> 22:41.486
I can't wait that long.

22:50.704 --> 22:52.414
Your wife, how's she doing?

22:53.207 --> 22:54.291
Vicky. She's great.

22:54.958 --> 22:56.043
She's great.

23:07.429 --> 23:08.764
What is that?

23:12.935 --> 23:14.520
When did you take these?

23:14.603 --> 23:17.231
I didn't. You pulled these for me.

23:17.314 --> 23:19.858
They're from the Dan Velazquez
byline negatives.

23:19.942 --> 23:21.401
For the piece on his murder?

23:22.152 --> 23:23.153
Am I covering it?

23:24.780 --> 23:26.698
No. You just pulled them from storage.

23:28.367 --> 23:29.952
Because I work in the archives.

23:30.994 --> 23:31.995
Yeah.

23:32.621 --> 23:33.622
Clarence is on this.

23:33.705 --> 23:35.958
He probably needs your help
tracking down Dan's articles.

23:58.689 --> 24:01.108
Hey. Can I help you?

24:01.608 --> 24:03.068
I'm fine, thanks.

24:03.151 --> 24:06.071
Great. What are you doing at my desk?

24:08.907 --> 24:10.117
Kirby told me to wait here.

24:10.617 --> 24:14.496
The archivist?
Why would she tell you to sit here?

24:17.541 --> 24:18.876
Because…

24:21.587 --> 24:23.255
It's okay. I was going.

24:24.673 --> 24:26.008
Who are you?

24:26.091 --> 24:30.846
I'm a… mechanical technician.

24:32.139 --> 24:33.140
For the building?

24:43.108 --> 24:44.818
Those are for the article
on Dan Velazquez?

24:45.444 --> 24:47.112
Yeah, I'm trying to pull any highlights.

24:47.196 --> 24:49.740
Abby said his best stuff was
from the early '80s,

24:49.823 --> 24:51.450
but I'm not that far back yet.

24:51.533 --> 24:53.493
Are you covering what happened to him?

24:53.577 --> 24:55.787
I guess. There's not much to throw in.

24:56.663 --> 24:59.291
What about the police report?
There any leads?

24:59.374 --> 25:00.626
It was light.

25:00.709 --> 25:06.256
Maybe a theft, a drug deal gone bad.
Medical examiner's report isn't out yet.

25:08.091 --> 25:09.593
Did the police see who robbed him?

25:09.676 --> 25:13.055
No. He was the one stealing.

25:15.307 --> 25:17.267
Yeah, he'd been doing shitty
for a while.

25:17.351 --> 25:20.604
Whoever he was robbing had a knife,
and… that was that.

25:21.730 --> 25:22.856
The police tell you that?

25:22.940 --> 25:24.733
Dan had some other guy's stuff on him.

25:29.571 --> 25:30.989
Why would Kirby leave you here?

25:33.075 --> 25:34.368
Like I said, I was going.

25:36.161 --> 25:38.205
Are you stealing that off my desk?

25:38.288 --> 25:39.831
No, this is Kirby's.

25:39.915 --> 25:41.750
-You need to go now.
-What's going on?

25:41.834 --> 25:44.086
-Don't touch me.
-Careful. Come with us, okay?

25:44.169 --> 25:46.630
-When did you get here?
-Is there anybody we can call?

25:46.713 --> 25:48.257
Someone who can take you home?

25:50.092 --> 25:52.469
-I don't know.
-What do you mean you don't know?

25:53.512 --> 25:55.848
-All right, we gotta go.
-Please, please.

25:55.931 --> 25:58.308
-Ma'am, it's okay.
-Please listen to me. I'm waiting here.

25:58.392 --> 25:59.393
-Okay.
-She's coming back,

25:59.476 --> 26:01.228
-and I'm waiting for her. Please.
-We'll find her.

26:31.884 --> 26:33.385
All right, thank you.

26:33.468 --> 26:36.513
-What happened?
-A woman came in off the street.

26:36.597 --> 26:37.973
Police had to get her out.

26:39.683 --> 26:40.893
Jinny?

26:40.976 --> 26:43.520
Don't know. Do you know her?

26:44.813 --> 26:46.815
Yeah, I told her she could be here.

26:47.858 --> 26:49.234
Okay, and who are you?

27:14.301 --> 27:15.302
Iris?

27:17.262 --> 27:19.765
Hi there. How can I help you?
Who sent you over?

27:20.599 --> 27:23.769
I came about Dan.
I worked with him at the Sun-Times.

27:24.269 --> 27:27.439
He had a good run there.
He hasn't been there for a while though.

27:28.106 --> 27:30.192
I'm actually not there anymore either.

27:30.275 --> 27:33.695
So, why are you here?
I'm not usually a stop on the tour.

27:36.198 --> 27:37.533
I wanted to see him.

27:39.201 --> 27:40.994
No, you don't.

27:41.870 --> 27:42.871
Not like this.

27:47.543 --> 27:49.837
And they couldn't find
anyone else to ID him.

27:50.921 --> 27:53.465
Good news was I could do it myself.

27:54.967 --> 27:56.552
That was a first for me.

28:01.640 --> 28:03.225
He was cut, right?

28:04.893 --> 28:06.228
Like this?

28:07.938 --> 28:09.231
How do you know that?

28:11.066 --> 28:12.484
'Cause I know who killed him.

28:13.610 --> 28:15.445
Then you really should
tell the police.

28:15.529 --> 28:16.530
I have.

28:17.948 --> 28:18.949
They won't listen.

28:19.783 --> 28:24.538
They said he stole something,
and I need to know what that was.

28:25.122 --> 28:27.583
Well, if you're working at press,
then I'm sure you're gonna

28:27.666 --> 28:29.835
get your hands on my report
as soon as it's released.

28:29.918 --> 28:32.754
Do you think he would steal, Iris?

28:33.589 --> 28:34.923
That's what the police are saying.

28:35.007 --> 28:38.886
That Dan… was a thief.

28:43.557 --> 28:46.560
But he never kept anything for himself.

28:49.354 --> 28:51.523
He told other people's stories.

28:53.066 --> 28:55.736
Everything he took, he passed on.

29:00.073 --> 29:05.621
And whatever he has, he took it for me.

29:13.921 --> 29:15.589
You sound very sincere.

29:18.091 --> 29:20.052
I'm gonna get a cup a coffee.
You want one?

29:22.513 --> 29:24.348
-No.
-Okay, then.

29:25.682 --> 29:28.352
Be careful over there.
See you in a minute.

31:12.122 --> 31:14.875
-Hey. Did you get everything you need?
-Yeah. Thanks, Howard.

35:56.114 --> 35:57.866
Know how to work that thing?

35:57.950 --> 35:58.951
Getting there.

36:03.330 --> 36:04.498
How'd you swipe it?

36:06.124 --> 36:09.503
I paid for it. You don't have
to steal when you have money.

36:14.007 --> 36:15.259
All right, get going.

36:19.471 --> 36:20.472
No, not like that.

36:21.890 --> 36:23.851
Like at Teenie's. Just be you.

36:25.102 --> 36:26.144
No French.

36:27.104 --> 36:28.856
Why? It remind you
too much of Paris?

36:28.939 --> 36:29.940
Yeah, maybe.

37:37.216 --> 37:38.550
It was never you.

37:40.010 --> 37:41.386
It's this house.

37:45.891 --> 37:48.769
That's right. It's my fucking house.

38:15.254 --> 38:17.673
Merci, Chicago, et bonne nuit!

38:36.692 --> 38:38.151
You shouldn't be here, Harper.

38:40.237 --> 38:42.739
Well, that's not much of a hello.
It's been two years.

38:43.615 --> 38:45.117
Thought you'd be happy I'm still alive.

38:45.200 --> 38:47.703
What are you so mad about?

38:47.786 --> 38:50.831
I'm not mad.
I don't think about you at all.

38:50.914 --> 38:53.250
Sure you do.
What about the letters I wrote you?

38:54.501 --> 38:55.502
You get those?

38:57.296 --> 38:59.131
No, I didn't get any letters.

39:02.342 --> 39:05.095
-I mean, I can tell you what they said--
-I don't care really.

39:07.222 --> 39:08.307
I have something for you.

39:11.268 --> 39:13.562
What? You've stopped liking presents?

39:15.522 --> 39:18.358
-I brought this back for you.
-I brought this back for you.

39:22.404 --> 39:24.031
It got caught on your pocketknife, right?

39:25.866 --> 39:27.034
And you sewed it.

39:31.622 --> 39:32.706
How'd you know that?

39:34.875 --> 39:36.168
-It's from Paris.
-It's from Paris.

39:38.962 --> 39:41.340
Only you've never actually been there,
have you?

39:44.426 --> 39:45.677
How are you doing this?

41:36.914 --> 41:39.958
Legion. Support your local Legion.

41:40.876 --> 41:43.795
Legion. Support your local Legion.

41:44.796 --> 41:46.632
-Support your local Legion.
-No, thank you.

41:52.095 --> 41:54.056
-Is this it?
-I guess.

42:10.030 --> 42:12.241
-You know what you're doing?
-Uh-huh.

42:12.324 --> 42:13.575
Could be someone home.

42:14.076 --> 42:16.495
There's an inch of dust on the shutters.

42:17.120 --> 42:18.664
No one's here.

42:31.969 --> 42:33.512
Whose house is this anyways?

42:47.067 --> 42:51.113
There's three sets of silver here.
How many people live in this place?

43:11.633 --> 43:13.302
Jesus! Harp?

43:16.805 --> 43:18.557
Easy, ma'am.

43:18.640 --> 43:19.850
Get out.

43:22.853 --> 43:24.521
-Leo!
-Stay down.

43:26.648 --> 43:27.649
Please.

43:29.151 --> 43:31.528
-I thought nobody was here.
-You don't care who's here.

43:31.612 --> 43:33.113
No, I swear I would--

43:33.197 --> 43:35.199
I wouldn't have hurt you. I wouldn't.

43:35.282 --> 43:36.950
Because I have a gun,
and you're on the ground.

43:37.034 --> 43:38.577
If you just let me go, I can go right now.

43:38.660 --> 43:41.747
I'll just walk out the door. I'll just
walk out the door right now, please.

43:41.830 --> 43:43.207
And you won't come back?

43:43.290 --> 43:44.333
No, never.

43:44.416 --> 43:46.627
You'll never see my face again. I promise.

43:48.462 --> 43:50.339
You can't not be who you are.

43:51.298 --> 43:53.008
Second son of a German mother.

43:53.800 --> 43:56.345
When she died, no one wanted you.

43:57.054 --> 43:58.472
Not even the nuns.

44:00.057 --> 44:01.225
And they'll take anyone.

44:02.142 --> 44:04.478
At least that's what you tell yourself
in your head.

44:06.480 --> 44:10.400
And it makes you think
that the world owes you.

44:12.152 --> 44:18.033
And that you can take whatever you want
from whoever there is.

44:18.116 --> 44:20.994
But this is mine.

44:23.288 --> 44:25.249
This is my house.

44:25.874 --> 44:27.000
How are you doing this?

44:27.584 --> 44:30.003
-I don't know you. I don't--
-No.

44:31.463 --> 44:32.464
Not today.

44:34.675 --> 44:37.135
But I am always with you.

44:37.803 --> 44:40.764
Get out, or I'll kill you.

44:42.558 --> 44:44.101
I've done it before.

44:59.741 --> 45:03.078
You hurt? Hey, what happened?
What happened?

45:03.161 --> 45:04.329
I don't know.

45:04.413 --> 45:05.998
Where'd you go, huh?

45:06.081 --> 45:07.374
Hey. Hey, hey.

45:09.501 --> 45:10.669
No, don't touch it.

45:20.721 --> 45:23.849
Leo, what's going on?
Why am I dressed like this?

45:23.932 --> 45:24.933
What? You got clothes on.

45:25.017 --> 45:28.145
No. My uniform. I was wearing my uniform.

45:28.228 --> 45:29.521
What uniform?

45:29.605 --> 45:31.523
What do you mean? My uniform. Our uniform.

45:31.607 --> 45:32.774
The same one that you're wearing.

45:32.858 --> 45:35.068
-Where would you get a uniform?
-What are you talking about?

45:35.152 --> 45:36.612
From when we were in France.

45:36.695 --> 45:39.281
The f-- The uniform that you're wearing.
When we fought together.

45:39.364 --> 45:41.825
-We first got talking at Saint Adalbert's.
-No.

45:41.909 --> 45:43.493
You never made it over to fight.

45:43.577 --> 45:45.037
Stop messing around, okay?

45:47.247 --> 45:48.248
I was there.

45:49.666 --> 45:50.834
We both were.

45:53.545 --> 45:54.796
We fought together.

45:56.715 --> 45:57.758
No, we didn't.

46:03.597 --> 46:04.598
Yeah.

46:07.100 --> 46:08.101
Right.

46:08.185 --> 46:10.354
So, what did you get in there?

46:11.438 --> 46:12.523
What?

46:13.607 --> 46:14.816
Inside. What'd you get?

46:17.778 --> 46:20.989
I don't know. It's just a-- some horse.

46:22.407 --> 46:26.703
It's not a horse. It's a Pegasus.
Horses don't have wings.

46:28.789 --> 46:32.209
It's just wood. It won't be worth much.

46:40.843 --> 46:42.803
Hey, Dad. Good to see you.

46:59.236 --> 47:01.738
These may look
like any other stars,

47:01.822 --> 47:03.198
but they don't belong here.

47:04.074 --> 47:07.536
Billions of years ago,
we collided with another galaxy.

47:08.078 --> 47:11.665
And these few stars,
they're all that's left of it.

47:12.207 --> 47:15.419
And now, all we can ask is,
what comes next?

47:32.936 --> 47:33.937
Hey.

47:36.148 --> 47:37.149
Hey.

47:38.942 --> 47:39.943
How are you?

47:42.279 --> 47:44.573
If you're trying to get me
to buy you a drink,

47:45.073 --> 47:46.783
you've already missed the last call.

47:46.867 --> 47:47.868
All right.

47:49.536 --> 47:50.746
Then give me yours.

47:52.372 --> 47:57.169
If I can guess what's in your pocket,
you have to hand it over.

48:00.964 --> 48:05.135
I don't have any cash, and this is fake.

48:05.928 --> 48:08.305
It's fine. I just want your drink.

48:17.189 --> 48:18.190
Go for it.

48:19.775 --> 48:24.738
Your jacket pocket, the inner one,
you carry a notebook.

48:26.031 --> 48:27.199
It's about this size.

48:38.961 --> 48:40.462
Have I interviewed you before?

48:41.964 --> 48:42.965
Nope.

48:47.719 --> 48:48.887
What do you write in here?

48:49.555 --> 48:50.973
Whatever people tell me.

48:54.309 --> 48:55.602
Those are my notes.

48:56.812 --> 48:57.813
I'll be quick.

48:59.648 --> 49:00.899
You're very strange.

49:04.778 --> 49:06.822
You sure I never interviewed you before?

49:08.574 --> 49:09.658
You tell me.

49:16.456 --> 49:17.457
I know you.

49:20.586 --> 49:21.587
From where?

49:41.857 --> 49:45.485
If you ever remember,
you know where to find me.

50:38.747 --> 50:39.665
Grendel.
