WEBVTT

00:08.383 --> 00:09.676
Cheese festival.

00:10.427 --> 00:12.012
Cheese festival.

00:13.596 --> 00:15.265
Another cheese festival.

00:16.808 --> 00:17.809
Hold up.

00:17.892 --> 00:20.270
There's a warehouse rave in Milwaukee.

00:20.353 --> 00:23.440
I need this. I want to go somewhere
where I don't have to hold back.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.150
You've been holding back?

00:25.233 --> 00:26.901
You have no idea.

00:28.403 --> 00:29.237
I don't know.

00:29.320 --> 00:32.449
Last time I went to a rave,
I stayed up for two days.

00:32.532 --> 00:36.119
Turns out, if a mint is 40 bucks,
it's not a mint.

00:37.454 --> 00:38.538
Great story.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.123
I still want to go.

00:40.749 --> 00:42.208
You know what I want?

00:42.292 --> 00:43.126
Don't say Jay.

00:43.209 --> 00:44.210
Jay.

00:45.670 --> 00:48.256
It was so hot when he didn't kiss me
on the car the other night.

00:48.339 --> 00:50.175
What does it mean? Where is it going?

00:50.258 --> 00:52.052
Should I start shaving
the back of my legs?

00:53.595 --> 00:56.806
Leia, placing all of your value
in the hands of a man

00:56.890 --> 00:58.099
is just giving it away,

00:58.183 --> 01:01.227
and the result of living
in an oppressive patriarchal society.

01:01.811 --> 01:04.606
She read the "Riot Grrrl Manifesto"
and won't shut up about it.

01:06.024 --> 01:07.525
I want to be a feminist.

01:08.234 --> 01:09.527
In college.

01:10.653 --> 01:14.115
But right now,
I really, really, really want a boyfriend.

01:14.616 --> 01:15.825
You didn't kiss her?

01:16.326 --> 01:18.703
Jay Kelso, of the Point Place Kelsos?

01:19.496 --> 01:21.456
The horniest family in town?

01:21.956 --> 01:23.792
I don't know what came over me.

01:24.292 --> 01:27.420
I mean, there's one voice in my head
saying, "Honk her boob, bro."

01:27.504 --> 01:29.339
But he's always there, so that's normal.

01:30.548 --> 01:35.428
The weird part was there was
this other sweet voice saying, "No, bro."

01:35.929 --> 01:37.138
"Honk her <i>heart</i>."

01:38.181 --> 01:40.517
Hey, wait.
You know what this means, right?

01:40.600 --> 01:41.434
You like her.

01:42.018 --> 01:43.728
No… Right?

01:44.687 --> 01:45.688
No.

01:46.397 --> 01:50.443
Yes, that's what that sweet voice means.
You're seeing her as a person.

01:50.527 --> 01:51.528
Weird.

01:52.570 --> 01:55.198
Leia, I'm not sure
if you're ready for Jay.

01:55.281 --> 01:56.533
He's a player.

01:56.616 --> 01:58.201
You just had your first kiss.

01:58.284 --> 01:59.619
Jay's had sex in a lake.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.414
I don't even like
to put my face in a lake.

02:05.917 --> 02:07.252
We don't want you to end up being

02:07.335 --> 02:10.088
some summer hookup
he dumps before school starts.

02:10.171 --> 02:12.340
Last Labor Day was a massacre.

02:12.423 --> 02:15.927
I've never seen so many Jennifers
crying in the same driveway.

02:16.594 --> 02:18.138
You need to close the deal ASAP.

02:18.221 --> 02:20.473
Just tell Leia you like her. Let's go.

02:21.558 --> 02:22.684
I can't.

02:22.767 --> 02:25.603
My dad always told me
to never tell a girl you like her first.

02:25.687 --> 02:27.730
It gives them all the control
in the relationship.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.607
That's not true.

02:29.691 --> 02:32.861
I made the first move with Nikki,
and I am <i>totally</i> in the driver's seat.

02:33.611 --> 02:34.904
That's right, babe.

02:39.117 --> 02:43.496
Dude, she makes you wear her dad's old
doctor pager in case she needs something.

02:43.580 --> 02:45.707
Hey, I only use it for emergencies.

02:45.790 --> 02:48.501
-Yeah, like last night.
-And what did you need last night?

02:48.585 --> 02:49.586
Gum.

02:50.962 --> 02:51.921
Emergency gum.

02:53.756 --> 02:55.008
Are you guys sure about Jay?

02:55.091 --> 02:56.718
A guy's not just gonna
pretend to be sweet.

02:56.801 --> 02:58.219
What would be the point of that?

02:58.928 --> 03:00.180
We don't get paid enough.

03:01.556 --> 03:05.393
Okay, look. If you're dead set
on dating that lake humper,

03:05.476 --> 03:07.103
at least be smart about it.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.396
Don't throw yourself at him.

03:08.479 --> 03:11.524
You are a goddess. Own your power.

03:11.608 --> 03:12.442
You're right.

03:12.525 --> 03:13.776
I'm going to make sure…

03:13.860 --> 03:15.737
-…he comes to me first.
-…she comes to me first.

03:15.820 --> 03:17.614
-<i>One, two, three, four</i>!

03:28.750 --> 03:31.294
<i>Hello, Wisconsin!</i>

03:32.295 --> 03:34.839
Now, I love <i>Law & Order</i>.

03:34.923 --> 03:37.884
The first part is about law,
and the second part is about order.

03:37.967 --> 03:39.260
It's very satisfying.

03:40.762 --> 03:43.556
Yep, the title pretty much explains it.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.601
Like <i>Honey, I Shrunk the Kids.</i>

03:46.684 --> 03:49.062
He shrunk his kids,
and now he has to tell his wife.

03:49.145 --> 03:49.979
I'm all caught up.

03:51.272 --> 03:54.901
Kitty, the whole point of watching TV

03:54.984 --> 03:57.362
is so we don't have to talk to each other.

03:57.862 --> 03:59.572
All right, I'll hush up.

04:15.505 --> 04:18.049
Did I tell you how adorable
Leia was the other day?

04:19.509 --> 04:23.054
We were coming up with
celebrity pasta names.

04:23.137 --> 04:24.889
I said Penne and Teller.

04:27.433 --> 04:30.561
She said Marky Markaroni.

04:32.772 --> 04:36.693
You know, I… I'm more than
just a grandma to her. I'm…

04:36.776 --> 04:38.695
We are friends and hang out.

04:40.446 --> 04:41.447
Hang out?

04:43.032 --> 04:45.243
You know who hung out with their parents?

04:46.494 --> 04:48.246
The Menendez brothers.

04:51.874 --> 04:52.875
Well.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.837
I'm not a fan of the murders.

04:58.172 --> 04:59.966
But a big fan of the sweaters.

05:02.677 --> 05:03.970
Look…

05:04.053 --> 05:08.558
We are not meant to be friends with kids.

05:08.641 --> 05:13.104
They're always eating, taking…
clogging things.

05:13.980 --> 05:16.816
You turn your back for one second,

05:16.899 --> 05:20.987
and some dumbass has put
a loaf of bread in your toilet.

05:21.070 --> 05:22.071
Oh!

05:22.572 --> 05:24.240
Rigatony Danza!

05:25.867 --> 05:28.286
Rigatony Danza! Leia! Leia!

05:34.167 --> 05:36.627
So your plan is to just oil yourself up

05:36.711 --> 05:40.089
and wait out here
for Leia to catch a hot glimpse?

05:41.257 --> 05:43.384
You forgot. I also brought my guitar.

05:47.555 --> 05:48.973
Okay, too much oil.

05:49.098 --> 05:50.933
Ugh! You're so cheesy.

05:51.434 --> 05:52.852
She's gonna love it.

05:52.935 --> 05:54.812
Hey, Nik. I got your page.

05:54.896 --> 05:56.898
I called your house,
but your mom said you were here.

05:56.981 --> 05:58.858
I need some of this on my shoulders.

05:58.941 --> 06:00.526
Oh. 'Course, babe.

06:01.110 --> 06:03.363
-Yeah, you're in the driver's seat.

06:07.283 --> 06:08.409
Seriously?

06:08.493 --> 06:10.078
You look like a wet hot dog.

06:11.704 --> 06:12.872
Thanks, Gwen.

06:16.125 --> 06:17.251
Hey, girl.

06:24.675 --> 06:25.802
Jay, hi.

06:25.885 --> 06:28.346
I mean, hi, Jai. Jay. Jai.

06:29.597 --> 06:30.723
Jai.

06:31.307 --> 06:32.308
Jai.

06:32.975 --> 06:33.976
I like that.

06:34.685 --> 06:36.270
That can be your cute nickname for me.

06:38.064 --> 06:39.816
Okay.

06:39.899 --> 06:41.359
Not okay. Let's go.

06:41.442 --> 06:42.693
Or you can stay here.

06:42.777 --> 06:45.321
You know, hang with… Jai.

06:46.489 --> 06:48.699
-Could I talk to you for a second?
-Sure.

06:48.783 --> 06:49.784
Okay.

06:51.619 --> 06:53.496
Why are you acting like Jay's pimp?

06:53.579 --> 06:57.041
I'm trying to get him coupled up with Leia
so he'll leave me and Nate alone.

06:57.125 --> 06:59.460
They share ice cream cones.
When Jay had mono, I got it.

07:00.920 --> 07:03.089
I don't want her to be
another one of Jay's summer lays.

07:03.172 --> 07:05.883
It's not like that. He actually likes her.

07:05.967 --> 07:08.511
Then he can ask her out like a gentleman.

07:08.594 --> 07:10.179
He won't do that.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.640
It's not allowed in his family
or something.

07:13.141 --> 07:15.893
Okay, well, she's not going to either,
so I guess we're done.

07:15.977 --> 07:18.146
See, it's all about moving the fingers.

07:19.814 --> 07:21.899
I can feel you talking in my ear.

07:22.817 --> 07:23.651
Leia!

07:23.734 --> 07:25.778
Sorry, I have to go.

07:30.992 --> 07:32.368
How did that not work?

07:32.452 --> 07:35.705
I mean, I even borrowed my dad's CK One
and put it everywhere.

07:37.331 --> 07:38.624
You smell great!

07:39.584 --> 07:41.085
Can I get a little of that, bro?

07:42.962 --> 07:43.963
Get in here!

07:53.598 --> 07:54.682
Who's paging me?

07:59.187 --> 08:00.271
Hello.

08:02.190 --> 08:03.816
Oh. Hi, Dr. Klein.

08:05.067 --> 08:07.403
It's some doctor.
He thinks I'm Nikki's dad.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.404
Hang up.

08:09.197 --> 08:10.198
Or…

08:11.157 --> 08:12.158
Uh-huh.

08:13.659 --> 08:15.745
Yes, I agree, that <i>should</i> be removed.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.123
Okay, sweet.

08:20.541 --> 08:21.876
Bye.

08:23.127 --> 08:24.128
Bro.

08:24.754 --> 08:25.880
I just doctored!

08:27.298 --> 08:29.008
Mad respect, bro.

08:29.592 --> 08:30.718
<i>Doctor</i> Bro.

08:37.767 --> 08:39.644
-Hi.
-Good morning.

08:39.727 --> 08:41.062
How did you get in my room?

08:41.145 --> 08:42.563
I climbed through the window.

08:43.105 --> 08:45.650
So what should we talk about?
Jay? Okay, sure.

08:45.733 --> 08:47.068
I think you should go for it.

08:47.818 --> 08:49.362
-I can't.
-Why not?

08:51.364 --> 08:52.698
What the hell is this?

08:52.782 --> 08:55.451
Shouldn't you be controlling
my brother's life with your body?

08:56.911 --> 08:58.704
He's like a zombie with a boner.

09:00.331 --> 09:03.167
So, Leia, Nate and I have
<i>Batman Forever</i> tickets tonight.

09:03.251 --> 09:05.503
But I was thinking,
you and Jay could use them

09:05.586 --> 09:09.006
and hang out… in the dark…
with no annoying people around.

09:10.174 --> 09:11.384
I would love to

09:11.467 --> 09:13.886
pass on that because I have plans tonight.

09:13.970 --> 09:15.471
Oh, really?

09:15.972 --> 09:17.473
Tell me more about these "plans."

09:17.557 --> 09:20.184
Um… we're going to, um…

09:20.268 --> 09:21.561
A rave in Milwaukee!

09:22.895 --> 09:24.146
Uh, yeah.

09:24.772 --> 09:26.065
Totally. A rave.

09:26.148 --> 09:27.817
I thought you were
taking a break from raves

09:27.900 --> 09:30.236
after you got stuck
in your neighbor's doggy door.

09:31.320 --> 09:32.738
I thought it was Narnia.

09:33.322 --> 09:34.365
It wasn't.

09:34.949 --> 09:37.952
Okay, well, if you're all going
to this totally real rave, then so are we.

09:38.035 --> 09:39.662
Cool. See you there.

09:40.454 --> 09:42.373
A rave?! Why did you say that?

09:42.456 --> 09:44.083
For purely selfish reasons.

09:45.084 --> 09:46.377
I can't.

09:46.460 --> 09:50.006
Raves are dangerous and illegal.
And what even is the bathroom situation?

09:50.089 --> 09:53.134
I'm a shy pee-er.
I can barely pee at the library.

09:53.759 --> 09:55.845
Relax. There'll be plenty of bathrooms.

09:55.928 --> 09:57.722
That's where everyone goes
to have sex and do drugs.

09:57.805 --> 09:59.515
What?! Forget it.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.726
I… This is way out of my comfort zone.

10:01.809 --> 10:03.894
Besides, my grandparents
would never let me go.

10:03.978 --> 10:05.062
Then lie.

10:05.146 --> 10:06.939
To their sweet little faces?

10:08.357 --> 10:09.358
I could never do that.

10:09.984 --> 10:12.028
A movie? That sounds fun.

10:13.321 --> 10:15.281
Yep.  <i>Batman Forever</i>.

10:15.364 --> 10:17.658
-It's getting <i>rave </i>reviews.
-Dude.

10:17.742 --> 10:20.411
Um, I mean, not rave reviews.
<i>Mixed</i> reviews.

10:20.494 --> 10:21.537
You caught me! I lied!

10:21.621 --> 10:24.874
I mean, I <i>didn't</i> lie
about going to the movies.

10:24.957 --> 10:26.042
I lied about the rave…

10:26.125 --> 10:26.959
reviews!

10:27.043 --> 10:28.002
We should get going.

10:28.085 --> 10:30.087
Bye, Grandma. Bye, Grandpa.
Rave a good night!

10:32.214 --> 10:33.341
Enjoy the movie!

10:35.676 --> 10:36.677
They're lying.

10:38.596 --> 10:41.265
Oh, Leia wouldn't do that to me.

10:41.349 --> 10:42.975
She's my pasta pal.

10:43.059 --> 10:47.063
Oh, darn it. I forgot to tell her
about Spaghetti Murphy.

10:53.319 --> 10:54.320
Wow.

10:55.446 --> 10:57.073
Those girls are half naked.

10:58.491 --> 10:59.825
And it's terrible.

11:03.079 --> 11:04.413
Why do you smell like cat pee?

11:04.497 --> 11:06.499
To close the deal with Leia,

11:07.416 --> 11:09.335
I put on a bunch of these pheromones

11:09.418 --> 11:11.629
I bought from the back
of my bodybuilding magazine.

11:12.463 --> 11:14.423
Tiger Sweat.

11:14.507 --> 11:15.591
That's badass.

11:15.675 --> 11:18.094
Ladies find the scent irresistible.

11:18.177 --> 11:20.513
Ugh! The van smells like ass.

11:21.847 --> 11:24.308
I got a terrible feeling
we didn't do something.

11:25.184 --> 11:27.228
-Did I bring the glow sticks?
-Yeah.

11:27.311 --> 11:28.938
Did I bring all the pacifiers?

11:29.021 --> 11:30.481
No, I did.

11:31.899 --> 11:33.442
What else could we be forgetting?

11:35.486 --> 11:36.654
Ozzie!

11:43.369 --> 11:45.621
I found <i>this </i>in the driveway.

11:49.250 --> 11:51.335
Still think they're at the movies?

11:51.419 --> 11:52.378
Well, let's…

11:53.087 --> 11:54.922
Let's not jump to conclusions.

11:55.965 --> 11:57.383
Ozzie, sweetie,

11:57.466 --> 12:01.679
why do you look like something
from one of my sleeping pill dreams?

12:06.434 --> 12:07.643
He's not talking.

12:08.978 --> 12:09.979
Yet.

12:11.564 --> 12:14.692
Now… where's my granddaughter?

12:15.401 --> 12:17.611
I'm not saying jack squat
until I talk to my mother.

12:17.695 --> 12:21.532
You'll never see your mother again
until you start talking.

12:23.492 --> 12:24.326
Okay, fine.

12:26.036 --> 12:27.288
She went to nunya.

12:30.082 --> 12:31.667
Now we're getting somewhere.

12:33.210 --> 12:34.170
Where's nunya?

12:34.754 --> 12:35.838
Nunya business.

12:39.842 --> 12:42.511
Well, Red, you kinda…
You just kinda walked into that.

12:47.349 --> 12:50.311
-How could you drive off without Ozzie?
-What? Don't blame me.

12:50.394 --> 12:53.355
I was a little distracted
ordering a blood transfusion.

12:54.315 --> 12:56.150
-What?
-Don't worry about it.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.905
You were right about the bathroom.
It was crazy.

13:00.988 --> 13:03.032
Some girl tried to hug me on the toilet.

13:04.700 --> 13:05.701
I've had enough.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.536
I'm gonna do the mature thing
and talk to Jay.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.121
Hold my binky.

13:12.458 --> 13:13.584
Hey, Jay.

13:13.667 --> 13:17.671
Um, can we just talk to each other
instead of whatever it is we're doing?

13:17.755 --> 13:19.465
Oh, I'm so glad you said that.

13:19.548 --> 13:22.384
We had a nice thing going,
and now everyone got involved.

13:22.468 --> 13:24.512
-It just got weird.
-Exactly.

13:25.012 --> 13:28.891
How about, on the count of three,
we both just say how we feel?

13:28.974 --> 13:30.309
Great.

13:30.392 --> 13:31.352
One, two, three.

13:31.435 --> 13:33.437
-I like you.
-I knew it!

13:34.480 --> 13:37.900
-What? No, you tricked me.
-Well, it doesn't matter. You said it.

13:38.984 --> 13:42.571
Oh my God. Everyone's right.
You… You're a player.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.990
Hey. That's an ugly stereotype

13:45.074 --> 13:47.243
for hot guys like me
who date lots of chicks.

13:47.326 --> 13:49.745
You know what? I did like you.

13:49.829 --> 13:53.541
I liked that guy on the car
who was sweet and sincere.

13:53.624 --> 13:56.001
But not this guy. This guy sucks.

13:56.585 --> 13:59.296
Well, fine. It doesn't matter
if you're into me or not.

13:59.380 --> 14:01.882
There's a warehouse
full of hot girls in there,

14:01.966 --> 14:03.342
and I smell like a tiger.

14:05.469 --> 14:06.637
A tiger's butthole!

14:07.847 --> 14:11.433
And there are guys in there too.
We'll see who has a better night.

14:11.517 --> 14:13.310
And you haven't seen my moves.

14:14.103 --> 14:15.396
What happened to my arm?

14:15.479 --> 14:17.606
It's feeling the music! That's what!

14:18.107 --> 14:20.234
Okay. Good luck in there.

14:30.452 --> 14:32.955
Is Jay seeing how much fun I'm having?

14:33.539 --> 14:37.042
It's hard to tell.
He's surrounded by so many girls.

14:37.126 --> 14:38.127
Pow.

14:38.961 --> 14:39.920
Hi-yah!

14:40.462 --> 14:41.630
Karate!

14:43.966 --> 14:45.509
I need to step it up.

14:49.680 --> 14:50.848
Are you okay?

14:51.891 --> 14:53.392
Do you need medical help?

14:53.475 --> 14:54.768
That guy's a doctor.

14:56.812 --> 14:57.897
X-ray!

14:58.898 --> 15:00.024
Which one?

15:02.067 --> 15:03.110
All of them.

15:05.154 --> 15:06.196
Ozzie…

15:06.906 --> 15:08.073
Honey…

15:09.867 --> 15:12.828
Obviously, you put a ton of work
into that costume.

15:12.912 --> 15:15.456
Thank you for noticing.

15:15.539 --> 15:18.334
I mean, the stitching on the rickrack.

15:18.417 --> 15:19.460
Wow!

15:20.920 --> 15:23.672
I want you to know that I see you.

15:24.798 --> 15:26.258
And I'm proud of you.

15:27.259 --> 15:29.845
And I am dazzled

15:29.929 --> 15:31.430
by your little balls.

15:44.109 --> 15:47.279
Okay, Mrs. Forman.
I'll tell you where Leia is.

15:47.363 --> 15:48.530
See, Red?

15:48.614 --> 15:51.951
If you trust them,
and you… you treat them with respect,

15:52.034 --> 15:53.869
they will be honest with you.

15:54.453 --> 15:56.205
Leia's at a rave in Milwaukee.

15:56.914 --> 15:58.499
That lying little bitch.

16:06.507 --> 16:10.010
You've been answering
my dad's doctor pages?

16:10.094 --> 16:11.762
I did pretty well, Nik.

16:11.845 --> 16:14.264
I got invited to a conference in Denver.

16:17.601 --> 16:19.186
He's coupled off.

16:20.104 --> 16:21.647
What should I do?

16:21.730 --> 16:25.067
Maybe stop dancing with just me.

16:25.150 --> 16:26.193
On it.

16:48.382 --> 16:49.258
Yep.

16:53.512 --> 16:56.056
So, to date,
the furthest I've gotten with a guy

16:56.140 --> 16:58.350
was grinding on my grandpa at a rave.

16:59.685 --> 17:01.979
Well, it's not nothing.
He took you home with him.

17:03.272 --> 17:05.524
This isn't funny, Gwen.
He's gonna kill me.

17:05.607 --> 17:08.068
I'm sorry. This kinda feels like my fault.

17:08.152 --> 17:09.862
That's because it's all your fault.

17:10.821 --> 17:13.907
I was trying to empower you,
but, to be honest,

17:13.991 --> 17:16.243
I only skimmed
that whole riot grrrl thing.

17:16.744 --> 17:19.413
But, if I had to guess
what it's all about,

17:19.997 --> 17:23.250
you should get to do what you want
without anyone holding you back,

17:23.333 --> 17:24.168
including me.

17:25.586 --> 17:29.423
So, if you still want Jay,
then go get him.

17:31.258 --> 17:33.218
After tonight, I don't know what I want.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.847
Either way, I should probably
break up with my grandpa first.

17:39.808 --> 17:40.809
Gwen.

17:40.893 --> 17:41.894
Get out.

17:42.853 --> 17:44.021
This is nunya.

17:46.607 --> 17:48.192
Nunya business.

17:52.780 --> 17:54.406
I'm so sorry, you guys.

17:54.490 --> 17:58.077
But, Grandma, you should know,
I feel nothing but regrettuccine Alfredo.

17:59.411 --> 18:00.621
Okay, that was good.

18:02.039 --> 18:03.123
But Grandma's pissed.

18:03.207 --> 18:05.417
I am so disappointed in you.

18:05.501 --> 18:08.796
You took advantage of my trust, my love,

18:09.630 --> 18:11.799
and all of my good safety pins.

18:12.966 --> 18:14.426
-I really messed up.
-Uh-huh.

18:14.510 --> 18:16.386
Well, you are grounded for a week.

18:16.470 --> 18:18.430
No cable, no Nintendo.

18:18.514 --> 18:20.265
And that Chia Pet you like so much?

18:20.766 --> 18:23.102
I'm gonna put it in the freezer
until it dies.

18:25.437 --> 18:27.064
Red, do you have anything to add?

18:27.564 --> 18:28.565
No.

18:29.525 --> 18:32.444
Just that… we're glad
you're home safe, kiddo.

18:33.654 --> 18:35.030
That's it?

18:35.114 --> 18:41.286
Well, I've seen enough <i>Law & Order</i>
to know that there has to be a good cop.

18:41.370 --> 18:42.621
So, I'm the bad cop?

18:45.207 --> 18:46.208
Oh, I like this.

18:47.543 --> 18:50.337
-Is this how you feel all the time?
-Oh yeah.

18:50.420 --> 18:52.881
You are bad!

18:55.634 --> 18:58.053
-Aw, you guys.
-Yeah, no. Go to your room.

19:04.268 --> 19:05.227
Hey.

19:05.310 --> 19:07.396
Hey. I heard you were grounded.

19:07.479 --> 19:08.772
I got busted too.

19:08.856 --> 19:11.775
That Tiger Sweat stuff
burned a hole in our carpet.

19:11.859 --> 19:13.402
Now my mom's pissed.

19:14.319 --> 19:17.948
Look… I just wanted to apologize
for how things went.

19:19.366 --> 19:20.367
It's okay.

19:20.450 --> 19:22.077
We both got kinda caught up in it.

19:22.161 --> 19:25.539
Look, I really am the guy
you thought I was.

19:26.540 --> 19:27.958
Okay? I'm done playing games.

19:28.750 --> 19:32.754
How about, on the count of three,
we both say how we feel about each other?

19:32.838 --> 19:35.090
-For real this time.
-Okay.

19:35.924 --> 19:37.259
One, two, three.

19:37.342 --> 19:39.511
-I like you.
-I think we should just be friends.

19:42.890 --> 19:44.349
Wait, friends?

19:45.642 --> 19:47.561
-Yeah.
-Like Ross and Rachel?

19:49.771 --> 19:51.523
More like Joey and Chandler.

19:52.774 --> 19:55.944
Look, the summer's not that long.
Let's not complicate it.

19:56.612 --> 19:58.155
So, friends?

19:58.238 --> 20:00.365
Sure. Friends.

20:00.449 --> 20:03.368
Friends? After he said all that?

20:03.452 --> 20:05.120
I'm so confused.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.371
So is he.

20:06.455 --> 20:08.498
Now I have all the power.

20:09.833 --> 20:10.667
It was a move.

20:11.460 --> 20:14.171
I played the player. I Kelsoed the Kelso.

20:14.254 --> 20:15.464
I…

20:15.547 --> 20:17.382
need you to tell me
I didn't screw it all up.

20:18.091 --> 20:20.010
It's so manipulative and sneaky.

20:20.761 --> 20:21.678
I love it.

20:23.347 --> 20:25.349
Hey! I'm still mad.

20:25.432 --> 20:26.850
Less talk, more rave.
