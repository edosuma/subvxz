00:00.166 --> 00:03.202
<i>Previously,</i>
<i>on</i> when calls the heart...

00:03.204 --> 00:04.470
Jack!
Welcome back.

00:04.472 --> 00:05.404
No elizabeth?

00:05.406 --> 00:06.672
I promise I'll write.

00:06.674 --> 00:07.639
I hope you do.

00:07.641 --> 00:09.341
Miss leveaux here

00:09.343 --> 00:11.076
Was just about to tell me
what brought her to hope valley.

00:11.078 --> 00:13.645
You've been spending quite
a bit of time with bill avery.

00:13.647 --> 00:15.047
Are you a friend of his?

00:15.049 --> 00:16.949
I'm his wife.

00:18.752 --> 00:22.488
[â™ª]

00:27.060 --> 00:28.360
Well, good morning, jack.

00:28.362 --> 00:29.328
Morning, abigail.

00:29.330 --> 00:31.830
Mrs. Graves.

00:31.832 --> 00:33.065
"mrs. Graves."

00:33.067 --> 00:35.234
Hearing that
will never get old.

00:35.236 --> 00:37.903
I'm gonna go check on
the breakfast loaf.

00:37.905 --> 00:40.172
I didn't know
mary was working here.

00:40.174 --> 00:42.041
She's watching over the cafe
while I'm away.

00:42.043 --> 00:43.042
Away?

00:43.044 --> 00:44.043
Where?

00:44.045 --> 00:46.078
Hamilton.
I haven't heard

00:46.080 --> 00:48.147
From clara since she left town
after the trial.

00:48.149 --> 00:50.015
I'm worried, jack.

00:50.017 --> 00:53.052
I feel like I owe it to peter
to make sure she's all right.

00:53.054 --> 00:55.821
Have you been
in touch with elizabeth?

00:55.823 --> 00:58.190
She knows the city,
maybe she can help.

00:58.192 --> 00:59.525
I sent her a telegram
this morning.

00:59.527 --> 01:00.626
Good.

01:00.628 --> 01:01.827
It's funny.

01:01.829 --> 01:05.064
I barely know clara,
but I feel like she's family.

01:05.066 --> 01:07.299
She is family.

01:08.868 --> 01:10.069
Well, I better pack

01:10.071 --> 01:11.937
If I'm gonna
make the next stage.

01:13.306 --> 01:16.075
Oh, abigail?

01:16.077 --> 01:18.911
When you see elizabeth,
tell her I--

01:18.913 --> 01:21.413
[sighs]

01:21.415 --> 01:23.215
Yes?

01:25.185 --> 01:28.520
Tell her I send my best.

01:28.522 --> 01:30.022
[sighs]

01:31.458 --> 01:32.524
[â™ª]

01:32.526 --> 01:35.127
Forward one, side two,

01:35.129 --> 01:37.663
Back three, and four,
cross left,

01:37.665 --> 01:39.031
Over right,

01:39.033 --> 01:41.333
Back six, side seven,
and to--

01:41.335 --> 01:43.235
[laughing]

01:43.237 --> 01:44.336
Hello!

01:44.338 --> 01:45.871
You're just in time.

01:45.873 --> 01:47.206
In time for what?

01:47.208 --> 01:48.340
The tango!

01:48.342 --> 01:49.908
It's all the rage
right now.

01:49.910 --> 01:52.077
Charles, come!
Dance with me.

01:52.079 --> 01:54.313
Um... If you insist.

01:54.315 --> 01:56.748
It's simple.
Just follow me.

01:56.750 --> 01:57.983
Like this?

01:57.985 --> 02:00.052
[â™ª]

02:00.054 --> 02:01.386
Charles!

02:01.388 --> 02:03.889
I'm sorry, am I
doing it wrong?

02:05.992 --> 02:08.393
Charles, when did
you learn how to tango?

02:08.395 --> 02:09.728
Can't I have my secrets?

02:09.730 --> 02:11.897
It's much easier than it looks.

02:11.899 --> 02:13.832
Shall we?

02:13.834 --> 02:16.401
[â™ª]

02:40.727 --> 02:42.794
[â™ª]

02:43.963 --> 02:45.564
Ahem.

02:48.001 --> 02:53.071
[â™ª]

03:08.388 --> 03:13.258
[â™ª]

03:21.201 --> 03:23.101
[chuckling]

03:24.571 --> 03:25.871
Abigail!

03:27.173 --> 03:28.307
Elizabeth!

03:28.309 --> 03:29.975
[laughs]

03:29.977 --> 03:32.077
Oh, it's so good to see you!

03:32.079 --> 03:33.412
How was your trip?

03:33.414 --> 03:34.646
Long.
I had no idea

03:34.648 --> 03:36.882
We lived in
such a big country.

03:36.884 --> 03:39.017
Well, you're here now,
and that's what matters.

03:39.019 --> 03:40.018
I so appreciate

03:40.020 --> 03:41.486
You letting me stay with you.

03:41.488 --> 03:43.055
As long as
you're in hamilton,

03:43.057 --> 03:44.890
My home
is your home.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.158
Are you sure
there's enough room?

03:46.160 --> 03:47.693
I don't
want to impose.

03:47.695 --> 03:49.861
Oh, it's really
no imposition.

03:49.863 --> 03:50.862
And we'll find
clara together.

03:50.864 --> 03:52.664
I'm just glad
you've had bill avery

03:52.666 --> 03:53.999
To lean on
through all this.

03:54.001 --> 03:55.834
He must have been
such a comfort.

03:55.836 --> 03:59.137
Oh, dear, we have
a lot to catch up on.

04:00.573 --> 04:03.976
[patrons chatting, indistinct]

04:11.084 --> 04:12.384
May I?

04:12.386 --> 04:15.053
Please.

04:20.126 --> 04:21.893
So...

04:21.895 --> 04:23.695
You're the new mayor
of hope valley.

04:23.697 --> 04:24.863
I am.

04:24.865 --> 04:28.800
I told you you'd want me
as your friend, mr. Coulter.

04:28.802 --> 04:32.304
Well, let's get down
to business, then, shall we?

04:32.306 --> 04:35.841
You're going to need a license
to do business in my town.

04:35.843 --> 04:37.976
Actually,
you're going to need two.

04:37.978 --> 04:40.145
One for your mill,

04:40.147 --> 04:42.347
And one for your office
out there on main street.

04:42.349 --> 04:44.383
How much?

04:44.385 --> 04:46.785
$200 apiece.

04:46.787 --> 04:51.023
Some people
might call that extortion.

04:51.025 --> 04:53.859
I call it the price
of free enterprise.

04:53.861 --> 04:57.663
I'd like a check
on my desk tomorrow afternoon.

04:57.665 --> 05:00.365
It would be a shame
to shut you down

05:00.367 --> 05:02.868
For something so trivial.

05:05.838 --> 05:08.807
Uh, should I make
the check out to the city,

05:08.809 --> 05:10.242
Or will you be depositing it

05:10.244 --> 05:12.244
Directly into
your personal account?

05:12.246 --> 05:14.813
Hmm.

05:14.815 --> 05:17.049
[â™ª]

05:19.452 --> 05:21.820
Elizabeth, you amaze me.

05:21.822 --> 05:25.791
You're so down-to-earth
and you come from all of this.

05:25.793 --> 05:28.994
You had to have missed it.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.462
Sometimes, I did.

05:30.464 --> 05:32.164
But... [sighs]

05:32.166 --> 05:33.465
I don't know.

05:33.467 --> 05:34.666
Sometimes, I feel like

05:34.668 --> 05:37.869
Hamilton just lacks
that... Something.

05:38.971 --> 05:41.173
Or someone?

05:41.175 --> 05:42.974
Perhaps.

05:42.976 --> 05:45.043
Look what
just arrived for you!

05:45.045 --> 05:46.545
They're from charles!

05:46.547 --> 05:48.013
He said he enjoyed having dinner
with you last night

05:48.015 --> 05:49.981
And hopes to have the pleasure
of your company again soon.

05:49.983 --> 05:51.483
Wait! You read the card?

05:51.485 --> 05:52.784
Well, of course, I did.

05:52.786 --> 05:53.885
Who's charles?

05:53.887 --> 05:55.187
[gasps]

05:55.189 --> 05:59.524
Mrs. Stanton!
How wonderful to see you.

05:59.526 --> 06:00.859
You too, julie.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.227
[julie]: Mother and father
can't wait to meet you!

06:02.229 --> 06:05.297
There's just enough time
to change before dinner.

06:05.299 --> 06:08.333
I'm happy to lend you
one of my gowns.

06:08.335 --> 06:09.901
Oh...

06:09.903 --> 06:13.672
Thank you, but I'll be fine
in what I brought.

06:13.674 --> 06:15.907
Okay.

06:18.878 --> 06:19.878
[indistinct chatter]

06:19.880 --> 06:21.980
Well, this is cause
for celebration.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.682
Might I buy you two gentlemen
a drink?

06:23.684 --> 06:24.850
Miss leveaux?

06:24.852 --> 06:25.917
I'll buy
the next round

06:25.919 --> 06:27.986
If you tell me what
you're celebrating.

06:27.988 --> 06:30.722
Oh, mr. Coulter,
it is a dream come true.

06:30.724 --> 06:33.959
I'm going to be starring
in a musical

06:33.961 --> 06:35.193
At the curran theater

06:35.195 --> 06:37.462
In san francisco!

06:37.464 --> 06:40.031
I-I guess congratulations
are in order.

06:40.033 --> 06:44.503
Mr. Garvey and mr. Seidler
work for wallace zellman.

06:44.505 --> 06:47.239
<i>The</i> wallace zellman.

06:47.241 --> 06:50.308
Is this a name
I should be familiar with?

06:50.310 --> 06:53.311
He produces the biggest shows
in the country!

06:53.313 --> 06:54.479
Mr. Zellman
saw miss leveaux

06:54.481 --> 06:56.081
Onstage in new york.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.382
We went to quite
a bit of trouble

06:57.384 --> 06:58.850
To track her down.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.986
He thinks she's
going to be a star.

07:00.988 --> 07:03.054
[giggling]

07:03.056 --> 07:05.357
Rehearsals begin
in three days,

07:05.359 --> 07:07.292
So I'll be leaving tomorrow.

07:07.294 --> 07:08.727
Oh!

07:08.729 --> 07:11.530
Uh, whe--
when will you be back?

07:11.532 --> 07:12.864
Well, if the show's a hit,

07:12.866 --> 07:15.567
Mr. Zellman will want to take it
on the road for a trial run,

07:15.569 --> 07:17.002
And then... [laughing]

07:17.004 --> 07:18.203
Broadway!

07:18.205 --> 07:20.172
It could
run for years.

07:20.174 --> 07:21.840
Uh, I'm--

07:21.842 --> 07:24.042
I'm-- I'm very happy for you,
rosemary. I...

07:25.678 --> 07:27.913
Now tell me more
about this part!

07:27.915 --> 07:29.414
Oh, you're going to
love this part.

07:29.416 --> 07:31.049
Perfect for you.

07:31.051 --> 07:32.717
You're going to love
the curran theater.

07:42.228 --> 07:43.628
Did you hear the news about--

07:43.630 --> 07:46.965
Rosemary starring in a show
in san francisco?

07:46.967 --> 07:49.701
Yeah, I think everyone
this side of the rockies

07:49.703 --> 07:51.136
Has heard about that.

07:52.805 --> 07:54.406
She really is
something, isn't she?

07:54.408 --> 07:55.373
She's a lot like you.

07:56.576 --> 07:57.976
Like me?

07:57.978 --> 07:59.044
How so?

07:59.046 --> 08:00.912
Rosemary knows how to dream big,

08:00.914 --> 08:02.814
And nothing
ever stands in her way.

08:02.816 --> 08:03.882
Like you.

08:06.619 --> 08:07.986
Yeah...

08:07.988 --> 08:11.089
I knew there was something
I liked about her.

08:13.392 --> 08:15.994
[birds singing]

08:15.996 --> 08:18.196
Well, we're so glad
you've come to stay with us.

08:18.198 --> 08:20.398
Well, I know you've been under
the weather, mrs. Thatcher.

08:20.400 --> 08:23.068
I do hope it's not a burden
for you to have a house guest.

08:23.070 --> 08:24.402
Oh, nonsense!

08:24.404 --> 08:26.304
I'm practically back
to my old self again,

08:26.306 --> 08:28.840
Thanks to charles' friend,
dr. Lyden.

08:28.842 --> 08:31.643
I hear you've come in search
of your daughter-in-law.

08:31.645 --> 08:33.512
Yes, I know
she works in hamilton,

08:33.514 --> 08:35.580
But I'm afraid
that's all I know.

08:35.582 --> 08:37.649
It's not much to go on.

08:37.651 --> 08:38.850
Abigail is
worried that clara

08:38.852 --> 08:40.652
Might've found herself
in some kind of trouble.

08:40.654 --> 08:42.020
I have connections
with the mounties.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.288
I'll give them a ring

08:43.290 --> 08:44.990
And have them put their best man
on the case right away.

08:44.992 --> 08:47.025
Oh, I couldn't ask you
to do that.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.693
You didn't ask.
I'm volunteering.

08:48.695 --> 08:49.995
Hamilton's a big city,

08:49.997 --> 08:51.229
And it's no place
for a woman

08:51.231 --> 08:52.697
To go about
searching for someone

08:52.699 --> 08:53.865
On her own.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.200
Thank you.

08:55.202 --> 08:58.036
I do have a photograph,
if you think that would help.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.471
It would, indeed.

08:59.473 --> 09:01.039
Let me go get it.

09:04.076 --> 09:06.311
I just can't imagine

09:06.313 --> 09:07.812
What the poor dear
is going through.

09:07.814 --> 09:09.047
[viola]: I'm so sorry
we're running late.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.982
Oh! No need to
apologize, darling.

09:10.984 --> 09:12.984
Dinner isn't
for another hour.

09:12.986 --> 09:14.819
Good.
Because lionel and I

09:14.821 --> 09:16.821
Have something
we'd like to tell you.

09:16.823 --> 09:17.822
[julie gasps]

09:17.824 --> 09:19.291
You're engaged?

09:19.293 --> 09:21.793
Oh, my goodness,
that's so exciting!

09:21.795 --> 09:23.962
Julie!
You've ruined the surprise.

09:23.964 --> 09:26.798
It wasn't
a surprise at all!

09:26.800 --> 09:28.500
We all knew
it was going to happen!

09:28.502 --> 09:29.801
[laughter]

09:29.803 --> 09:30.969
Oh, my goodness,

09:30.971 --> 09:32.704
This is wonderful
news, darling.

09:32.706 --> 09:33.872
Oh!

09:33.874 --> 09:35.473
-Welcome to the family.
-Thank you.

09:35.475 --> 09:37.542
I hope to make
your daughter very happy.

09:37.544 --> 09:38.877
Would you like
to see my ring?

09:38.879 --> 09:40.545
-Oh...
-It's so beautiful.

09:40.547 --> 09:42.981
It belonged
to my grandmother.

09:42.983 --> 09:44.549
We must have
a little party to celebrate

09:44.551 --> 09:48.887
Just a few close friends.
Perhaps a luncheon tomorrow.

09:48.889 --> 09:50.355
Are you sure
you're up to it?

09:50.357 --> 09:51.523
If you take away my parties,
william,

09:51.525 --> 09:54.326
You take away
my raison d'etre.

09:54.328 --> 09:55.660
[laughter]

09:55.662 --> 09:57.796
-Congratulations!
-Thank you.

09:57.798 --> 09:59.431
[â™ª]

10:09.508 --> 10:10.842
I could use a few more men
to help this week

10:10.844 --> 10:11.977
If you can spare them.

10:11.979 --> 10:13.979
Yeah, of course.

10:15.147 --> 10:17.048
Something wrong?

10:17.050 --> 10:18.883
Sorry, what?

10:18.885 --> 10:19.851
Everything okay?

10:19.853 --> 10:20.885
Oh, yeah, everything's fine.

10:20.887 --> 10:21.886
Nothing I can't handle.

10:21.888 --> 10:22.854
Okay.

10:26.292 --> 10:27.292
There you go.

10:27.294 --> 10:28.927
Alrighty.

10:30.496 --> 10:32.864
You know...
You're pretty handy with a saw.

10:32.866 --> 10:35.300
If you're ever looking
for another line of work,

10:35.302 --> 10:36.301
You let me know.

10:36.303 --> 10:37.535
Thanks.

10:37.537 --> 10:39.237
All right, I've got to
get some stuff done.

10:39.239 --> 10:40.805
[thunder rumbles in distance]

10:40.807 --> 10:43.508
Hey, travis?

10:43.510 --> 10:45.710
You mind throwing a tarp
over that lumber tonight?

10:45.712 --> 10:47.078
-Yeah, you bet.
-Thanks.

10:47.080 --> 10:49.481
Looks like you fellas
are making some progress.

10:49.483 --> 10:50.548
I know
the man upstairs

10:50.550 --> 10:51.916
Will be mighty
appreciative of that.

10:51.918 --> 10:53.852
Well, I don't think
he'd recognize me.

10:53.854 --> 10:55.954
It's been a long time
since I've been in a church.

10:55.956 --> 10:57.355
Well, since
you haven't been

10:57.357 --> 10:58.356
Struck by
lightning yet,

10:58.358 --> 11:00.191
You might want to
come by Sunday.

11:00.193 --> 11:01.326
Yeah.

11:01.328 --> 11:03.461
Yeah, I'll think
about it.

11:06.832 --> 11:07.999
I was wondering.

11:08.001 --> 11:10.235
Do you think
you could build that?

11:10.237 --> 11:11.569
That a pulpit?

11:11.571 --> 11:13.638
That's right.
Uh, nothing too fancy.

11:13.640 --> 11:15.407
Maybe out of oak?

11:15.409 --> 11:17.008
Oh, what's that?

11:17.010 --> 11:19.577
That's the cabinet door.

11:19.579 --> 11:21.413
What, you want a cabinet
in a pulpit?

11:21.415 --> 11:23.014
Well, it might
come in handy,

11:23.016 --> 11:26.017
And, uh, it's gonna
need a lock on it.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.919
[â™ª]

11:35.728 --> 11:40.331
Ah! I suppose that's it.

11:40.333 --> 11:41.966
[laughs]

11:44.070 --> 11:45.970
I'm ready to leave.

11:45.972 --> 11:47.005
We're going to
miss you.

11:47.007 --> 11:48.339
Things certainly
haven't been

11:48.341 --> 11:51.342
The same around here
since you arrived.

11:51.344 --> 11:53.645
Well, thank you
for welcoming me into your town,

11:53.647 --> 11:55.547
And into your hearts.

11:55.549 --> 11:58.049
You've been very kind.

11:58.051 --> 12:00.018
I won't forget you.

12:00.020 --> 12:01.853
Safe travels.

12:07.660 --> 12:09.127
Well, rosemary...

12:09.129 --> 12:11.396
Finally gotten
what you've wished for.

12:11.398 --> 12:14.532
It's the start
of a new life for me.

12:14.534 --> 12:17.302
I hope it brings you
everything you want.

12:23.743 --> 12:26.111
I'm gonna miss you.

12:27.680 --> 12:30.215
I'll even miss you,
you big old dog.

12:30.217 --> 12:31.750
[barks]

12:31.752 --> 12:33.284
[laughs]

12:34.487 --> 12:37.255
[â™ª]

12:41.627 --> 12:43.461
Take care of yourself.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.396
You too.

12:45.398 --> 12:47.265
[engine chugging]

12:51.337 --> 12:53.905
Well... There she goes.

12:56.142 --> 12:58.376
[rip howls]

12:58.378 --> 13:00.211
[â™ª]

13:03.048 --> 13:04.182
[rosemary]: I do wish
you'd brought a script

13:04.184 --> 13:06.384
So I could begin learning
my lines and my songs.

13:06.386 --> 13:07.719
You know, I once was in
a production

13:07.721 --> 13:10.722
Of <i>the warbling wren,</i>
<i>in which I had 11 songs,</i>

13:10.724 --> 13:12.390
And I had to hit high-"f"
three times,

13:12.392 --> 13:13.691
Just like this--

13:13.693 --> 13:16.995
[sustaining high note]:
â™ª ahh...

13:16.997 --> 13:18.797
[cutting her off]:
Miss leveaux!

13:18.799 --> 13:20.899
Yes?

13:20.901 --> 13:22.700
There is no play.

13:22.702 --> 13:24.969
And we're not working
for mr. Zellman.

13:24.971 --> 13:26.337
We've been hired
by cliff conley.

13:26.339 --> 13:27.372
Cliff conley?

13:27.374 --> 13:29.507
No. There must be some mistake.

13:29.509 --> 13:31.142
He was the producer
of <i>the warbling wren.</i>

13:31.144 --> 13:33.011
The man whose
money you stole.

13:33.013 --> 13:34.979
That's a lie!
I never stole any money.

13:34.981 --> 13:35.980
Then what happened

13:35.982 --> 13:37.315
To the box office
receipts?

13:37.317 --> 13:38.817
I can explain that!

13:38.819 --> 13:40.018
You can
explain it to him.

13:40.020 --> 13:41.686
And enough
with the singing.

13:41.688 --> 13:42.954
Ooh! You...

13:42.956 --> 13:44.489
Turn this car
around

13:44.491 --> 13:45.890
And take me back
right now!

13:45.892 --> 13:47.826
Afraid
we can't do that.

13:47.828 --> 13:49.961
Well, then I am
just going to scream!

13:49.963 --> 13:52.363
As long
as you don't sing.

13:52.365 --> 13:55.033
[â™ª]

14:00.372 --> 14:02.040
[door opens]

14:02.042 --> 14:03.041
Abigail?

14:03.043 --> 14:05.009
Hmm?

14:05.011 --> 14:07.178
Bill avery
is the mountie

14:07.180 --> 14:09.113
Who's come
to help find clara.

14:10.916 --> 14:13.017
I thought you were
on an investigation.

14:13.019 --> 14:14.352
I was...

14:14.354 --> 14:16.020
But when I heard
it was the thatchers

14:16.022 --> 14:17.355
That needed an investigator,

14:17.357 --> 14:19.190
I volunteered
for the assignment.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.559
I'll leave
you two alone.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.231
It certainly
is good to see you.

14:26.233 --> 14:29.033
I just wish it was under
happier circumstances.

14:29.035 --> 14:30.869
This is awkward.

14:32.037 --> 14:33.938
I don't understand.

14:36.075 --> 14:38.977
Does the name "nora avery"
help you understand?

14:38.979 --> 14:42.046
Because she
showed up at my door.

14:45.417 --> 14:46.684
-Abigail--
-oh, please.

14:46.686 --> 14:48.820
Don't bother
trying to explain.

14:48.822 --> 14:49.988
What did
she tell you?

14:49.990 --> 14:50.989
Enough!

14:50.991 --> 14:52.357
You lied to me.

14:52.359 --> 14:54.893
Abigail, please!
You don't know the whole story.

14:54.895 --> 14:56.961
I don't want to hear
any more of your stories.

14:58.731 --> 15:01.065
I understand that you're angry,

15:01.067 --> 15:04.469
And you don't want to hear
what I have to say.

15:04.471 --> 15:07.038
Will you please allow me
to help you find clara?

15:07.040 --> 15:08.573
I don't
want your help!

15:08.575 --> 15:09.974
Well, you're
going to need it.

15:09.976 --> 15:11.509
I don't need
anything from you.

15:11.511 --> 15:13.878
I'm going to find her.

15:13.880 --> 15:16.314
And once I do,
I promise you,

15:16.316 --> 15:17.882
You'll never see me again.

15:17.884 --> 15:20.551
I will ask mr. Thatcher
to contact the mounties

15:20.553 --> 15:22.553
And have someone else
assigned to the case.

15:22.555 --> 15:23.655
Abigail!

15:23.657 --> 15:24.722
Can you find your own way out,

15:24.724 --> 15:26.925
Or should I have
the butler escort you?

15:29.161 --> 15:30.962
[â™ª]

15:47.079 --> 15:49.047
Mr. Duncan.

15:49.049 --> 15:50.348
How was your trip?

15:50.350 --> 15:51.983
Well, I got
mr. Coulter's permits

15:51.985 --> 15:53.685
For the sawmill
signed off on.

15:53.687 --> 15:56.054
Nearly cost me my life, though.

15:56.056 --> 15:57.889
-What happened?
-A couple of lugs--

15:57.891 --> 16:00.825
...In a big, fancy car
nearly ran me off the road.

16:00.827 --> 16:03.027
And miss leveaux
looked fit to be tied!

16:03.029 --> 16:05.330
Rosemary was in the car?

16:05.332 --> 16:06.464
Bouncing around
in the back

16:06.466 --> 16:08.032
While this madman
behind the wheel--

16:08.034 --> 16:10.034
But you were coming in
from benson hills, weren't you?

16:10.036 --> 16:11.636
Yeah. Why?

16:11.638 --> 16:12.870
Well, that's east of here.

16:12.872 --> 16:14.405
Rosemary was heading west,
to san francisco.

16:14.407 --> 16:16.574
Not on that road,
she wasn't.

16:16.576 --> 16:18.476
[â™ª]

16:20.412 --> 16:22.313
[horse whinnies]

16:24.049 --> 16:26.284
[â™ª]

16:29.621 --> 16:31.322
You look
as tired as a dog.

16:31.324 --> 16:34.926
Ugh, you don't
want to hear about it.

16:36.195 --> 16:37.962
Well, listening is my job.

16:37.964 --> 16:40.031
All right. [sighs]

16:40.033 --> 16:42.166
The sawmill's
ready to go.

16:42.168 --> 16:44.836
We just can't get
the engine up and running.

16:44.838 --> 16:46.738
What, your millwright
can't figure it out?

16:46.740 --> 16:47.972
Yeah, he's
trying his best,

16:47.974 --> 16:50.408
But he's never worked
on a diesel before.

16:50.410 --> 16:52.977
Maybe it's time
we asked for a favor.

16:52.979 --> 16:54.746
No disrespect, pastor,

16:54.748 --> 16:56.814
But I think the big guy
has better things to do

16:56.816 --> 16:58.649
Than to fix my mill.

16:58.651 --> 17:00.518
Anyway, I've been in
tighter jams than this before.

17:00.520 --> 17:01.686
I'm sure
I'll figure it out.

17:01.688 --> 17:04.455
Well, suit yourself.

17:04.457 --> 17:07.625
Uh... Though,
that being said,

17:07.627 --> 17:09.327
You know,
if you'd like

17:09.329 --> 17:10.995
To give it a... A try,

17:10.997 --> 17:13.031
I'm sure it couldn't
hurt, right?

17:13.033 --> 17:15.466
[â™ª]

17:20.039 --> 17:22.707
So you're the charles
I've heard so much about?

17:22.709 --> 17:23.841
I hope some
of it's been good.

17:23.843 --> 17:26.044
Well, I've only heard
wonderful things.

17:26.046 --> 17:26.878
And I've heard
wonderful things

17:26.880 --> 17:28.146
About you as well.

17:28.148 --> 17:29.747
I'm glad
our darling elizabeth

17:29.749 --> 17:31.049
Has you as a friend.

17:31.051 --> 17:33.718
We worry about her
being so far away.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.053
[footsteps approaching]

17:35.055 --> 17:36.054
Mrs. Stanton?

17:36.056 --> 17:39.023
You have a visitor.

17:39.025 --> 17:41.826
Uh, forgive the intrusion.

17:41.828 --> 17:43.327
I think
I have a lead on clara.

17:43.329 --> 17:44.829
Someone recognized
her picture.

17:44.831 --> 17:46.230
Where is she?

17:46.232 --> 17:48.633
East side of town.
Across the railroad tracks.

17:48.635 --> 17:50.535
Now, I can take you there
if you want,

17:50.537 --> 17:52.904
Or I can get her
and bring her back here.

17:52.906 --> 17:53.871
No. I'll go myself,

17:53.873 --> 17:55.873
If you'll give me
the address.

17:55.875 --> 17:57.208
That part of town's
not suitable

17:57.210 --> 17:59.010
For a woman to travel alone.

17:59.012 --> 18:00.078
Then I'll
come as well.

18:00.080 --> 18:02.513
Me too!
This is exciting.

18:02.515 --> 18:03.714
You have obligations
of your own,

18:03.716 --> 18:05.550
I couldn't impose.

18:05.552 --> 18:07.685
Well, if there's
anything you need, abigail.

18:07.687 --> 18:09.720
Thank you.

18:09.722 --> 18:12.056
[sighs]
shall we go?

18:13.358 --> 18:15.626
[â™ª]

18:17.796 --> 18:19.397
"obligations" is right.

18:19.399 --> 18:22.567
Remind me why we're all
gathering here yet again?

18:22.569 --> 18:25.837
For a champagne toast
to viola and sir lionel.

18:25.839 --> 18:27.705
Toasts...

18:27.707 --> 18:28.840
Luncheons...

18:28.842 --> 18:30.541
Dinners...
So much fuss.

18:30.543 --> 18:32.510
When I get engaged,

18:32.512 --> 18:33.811
I'm not gonna
tell anyone,

18:33.813 --> 18:35.713
I'll just elope.

18:35.715 --> 18:36.914
[laughs]

18:36.916 --> 18:38.916
But, julie, you love
parties and dances

18:38.918 --> 18:41.619
And balls and luncheons.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.955
That was the old me.

18:43.957 --> 18:46.858
Now I find them deadly dull.

18:46.860 --> 18:50.128
Well, we'd better not keep
mother and father waiting.

18:50.130 --> 18:51.496
What's your hurry?

18:51.498 --> 18:53.965
Something else

18:53.967 --> 18:56.167
On your afternoon
social calendar?

18:56.169 --> 18:58.169
Don't be a goose, charles.

18:58.171 --> 19:00.938
I'm just trying to be punctual.

19:02.307 --> 19:04.308
[â™ª]

19:08.213 --> 19:09.480
[local dogs barking]

19:09.482 --> 19:10.915
Is this where
she lives?

19:10.917 --> 19:12.683
This is her
last-known address.

19:12.685 --> 19:15.786
No wonder why she didn't
want to talk about it.

19:15.788 --> 19:16.821
Mrs. Stanton.

19:16.823 --> 19:19.557
Clara.

19:19.559 --> 19:21.559
What are you doing here?

19:21.561 --> 19:24.695
Is there someplace
we can go to talk?

19:24.697 --> 19:26.164
You shouldn't be here.

19:26.166 --> 19:27.798
Mrs. Stanton
came all the way

19:27.800 --> 19:29.367
From hope valley
to see you.

19:29.369 --> 19:31.102
I've been very
worried about you.

19:36.909 --> 19:38.576
[birds squawking]

19:38.578 --> 19:40.711
[engine hissing]

19:44.016 --> 19:45.383
I'm telling you,

19:45.385 --> 19:47.652
I did not take
mr. Conley's money.

19:47.654 --> 19:49.453
It's my director,
mike ryan,

19:49.455 --> 19:50.688
That you want.

19:50.690 --> 19:53.057
He's the one
who stole your boss' money.

19:53.059 --> 19:54.692
Yeah, but ryan's
done a good job of hiding,

19:54.694 --> 19:57.061
And mr. Conley believes
that when word gets out

19:57.063 --> 19:58.296
We have
his precious girlfriend,

19:58.298 --> 20:00.198
He'll have
a change of heart.

20:00.200 --> 20:03.000
Afraid I'm not mike ryan's
"precious" anything.

20:03.002 --> 20:05.002
He dropped me
like a hot stone

20:05.004 --> 20:07.638
As soon as he got
his hands on that cash.

20:10.008 --> 20:13.044
I swear,
I am of no value to you.

20:13.046 --> 20:16.714
[sobs] absolutely none.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.883
Oh, I find that
hard to believe.

20:18.885 --> 20:21.786
A man would have to be crazy
not to, uh,

20:21.788 --> 20:23.854
Come to
your rescue.

20:27.159 --> 20:28.859
[chuckles]

20:30.829 --> 20:34.232
I think we might've got off
on the wrong foot.

20:34.234 --> 20:36.667
You're very sweet...

20:36.669 --> 20:38.236
And cute, too.

20:38.238 --> 20:39.870
[smack]

20:43.675 --> 20:45.009
Ahh!

20:45.011 --> 20:46.744
Let go of me!

20:47.879 --> 20:49.113
[gasps] jack!

20:54.620 --> 20:55.519
[blows landing]

20:58.490 --> 20:59.957
[jack]: You okay?

20:59.959 --> 21:01.959
Come on! Get in.

21:03.662 --> 21:05.129
Jack, I was so scared!

21:05.131 --> 21:06.230
It's okay.

21:06.232 --> 21:08.432
You're safe now, okay?

21:10.569 --> 21:13.137
But what about my bags?

21:15.540 --> 21:17.008
[rosemary whimpers]

21:17.010 --> 21:18.209
[â™ª]

21:21.980 --> 21:23.914
How long have you been
under the employment

21:23.916 --> 21:25.916
Of this "mr. Fletcher"?

21:25.918 --> 21:27.952
A little over a year.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.122
I work seven days a week.

21:31.124 --> 21:33.124
Sometimes, I don't
finish till midnight,

21:33.126 --> 21:35.293
And I start at five.

21:35.295 --> 21:37.161
How did you get
in this man's debt?

21:37.163 --> 21:40.865
My father was sick
for a long time before he died.

21:40.867 --> 21:42.967
When I couldn't
pay his doctor bills,

21:42.969 --> 21:45.102
Mr. Fletcher loaned me $500.

21:46.471 --> 21:47.905
I couldn't pay it back.

21:47.907 --> 21:49.907
He told me I'd have to
work as his servant

21:49.909 --> 21:51.042
Until we were even.

21:51.044 --> 21:52.343
If I didn't,

21:52.345 --> 21:54.178
He said he would have me
arrested and put in jail.

21:54.180 --> 21:55.479
You have my word,

21:55.481 --> 21:57.648
You won't
be going to jail.

21:57.650 --> 21:59.350
Why didn't you
come to me for help?

21:59.352 --> 22:01.419
How could I?

22:03.021 --> 22:05.156
I had just met you.
I didn't want to be a burden.

22:05.158 --> 22:06.957
Clara, you could
never be a burden.

22:06.959 --> 22:08.993
I'm going to take care of this,
don't you worry.

22:08.995 --> 22:10.027
No.

22:10.029 --> 22:11.662
Mr. Fletcher
is a powerful man.

22:11.664 --> 22:13.964
I have seen what he can do.

22:13.966 --> 22:15.399
Clara...

22:15.401 --> 22:18.002
If this mr. Fletcher
is exploiting you in any way,

22:18.004 --> 22:19.570
There are things
that I can do

22:19.572 --> 22:21.372
To remedy
the situation.

22:21.374 --> 22:23.574
I don't want your help.

22:23.576 --> 22:25.910
I can take care
of this myself.

22:25.912 --> 22:27.244
Clara!

22:27.246 --> 22:29.146
You need to
leave now.

22:29.148 --> 22:30.715
I have to
get to work.

22:32.484 --> 22:34.051
[abigail]:
Clara, please let us help you.

22:34.053 --> 22:37.054
You can help me
by leaving me alone.

22:38.623 --> 22:41.025
[â™ª]

22:52.671 --> 22:53.904
The poor girl is terrified.

22:53.906 --> 22:55.740
I've got to do something.

22:55.742 --> 22:57.408
If you'll allow me--

22:57.410 --> 22:58.676
I can handle it myself.

22:58.678 --> 23:00.945
And just how are you
going to do that?

23:03.048 --> 23:05.316
With all due
respect, abigail,

23:05.318 --> 23:08.285
I know how to deal with
men like mr. Fletcher.

23:08.287 --> 23:10.554
Let me handle this.

23:13.658 --> 23:16.527
[julie]: You're so wicked.
What if we get caught?

23:16.529 --> 23:18.028
No one's gonna
be here for hours.

23:18.030 --> 23:20.898
They won't even know
we were here.

23:20.900 --> 23:21.866
[gasps] look!

23:21.868 --> 23:23.934
Just what we need.

23:30.876 --> 23:32.977
[â™ª]

23:34.646 --> 23:36.247
[volume increases]

23:36.249 --> 23:37.915
[â™ª]

23:37.917 --> 23:39.483
Are you ready?

23:39.485 --> 23:41.719
I'm all yours.

23:41.721 --> 23:44.021
[â™ª]

23:44.023 --> 23:46.991
Except I don't really know why
I need to learn how to dance.

23:46.993 --> 23:49.093
So we can cut a rug
in all the clubs.

23:50.529 --> 23:52.062
Well, I'm starting
to like this now.

23:52.064 --> 23:53.697
Now just follow me.

23:53.699 --> 23:55.132
Back, right...

23:55.134 --> 23:57.635
Forward,

23:57.637 --> 23:59.570
Forward, cross over,

23:59.572 --> 24:01.972
Forward, right,

24:01.974 --> 24:03.140
Together.

24:03.142 --> 24:04.341
That's it!

24:04.343 --> 24:05.543
You're a natural.

24:05.545 --> 24:06.444
You're a good teacher.

24:08.814 --> 24:11.048
[â™ª]

24:16.555 --> 24:18.422
[snap]

24:20.058 --> 24:22.026
Sorry I couldn't get us back
to hope valley in time.

24:23.395 --> 24:25.329
Sergeant needs a night's rest.

24:25.331 --> 24:26.897
Oh, I don't mind
spending the evening

24:26.899 --> 24:28.966
With my mountie hero.

24:28.968 --> 24:30.401
But you might have
brought a tent,

24:30.403 --> 24:31.535
Some sleeping bags,

24:31.537 --> 24:33.003
And a pot
of hot coffee.

24:33.005 --> 24:35.005
I would've,

24:35.007 --> 24:36.974
But I left in
a bit of a hurry.

24:36.976 --> 24:38.909
[laughs] no complaints.

24:38.911 --> 24:41.579
You saved my life.

24:43.915 --> 24:45.783
Jack?

24:49.988 --> 24:53.290
Why didn't things
work out between us?

24:53.292 --> 24:55.993
Because of
things like this.

24:55.995 --> 24:57.161
Like what?

24:57.163 --> 24:58.562
You, running off

24:58.564 --> 24:59.997
With men
you don't even know,

24:59.999 --> 25:01.665
For the promise of fame.

25:01.667 --> 25:03.167
What were you thinking?

25:03.169 --> 25:05.669
They had business cards.

25:05.671 --> 25:07.238
See, that's where
you go wrong.

25:07.240 --> 25:10.040
Whatever you have
is never good enough.

25:12.010 --> 25:13.811
I'm sorry.

25:13.813 --> 25:16.013
You're right.

25:16.015 --> 25:18.015
I left you because
I was too blind to see

25:18.017 --> 25:20.084
What a precious
thing I had.

25:23.488 --> 25:26.223
I'll never make
that mistake again.

25:28.226 --> 25:30.060
[â™ª]

25:33.131 --> 25:35.032
Where are you going?

25:35.034 --> 25:36.967
To see if
I can find us

25:36.969 --> 25:38.002
Something to eat.

25:38.004 --> 25:38.969
Then I'll have

25:38.971 --> 25:40.504
The poached salmon

25:40.506 --> 25:42.873
And some of those
little white potatoes.

25:42.875 --> 25:43.741
[laughs]

25:45.076 --> 25:47.111
[â™ª]

25:55.186 --> 25:57.788
[knocking]

26:01.126 --> 26:03.961
I wanted to return these.

26:03.963 --> 26:05.963
Thank you.

26:12.137 --> 26:13.971
Viola?

26:16.641 --> 26:19.543
I know we've never been
very... Close,

26:19.545 --> 26:22.713
But I just wanted to say
that I'm so happy for you.

26:22.715 --> 26:25.349
You and lionel really
make a lovely couple.

26:25.351 --> 26:27.384
That's nice of you to say.

26:28.954 --> 26:32.056
I can't believe one of us
is getting married.

26:32.058 --> 26:35.225
It all seems
so sudden and grown-up.

26:35.227 --> 26:38.729
That's because you live
in a different world.

26:38.731 --> 26:41.732
In my world, it's natural
to find a proper consort,

26:41.734 --> 26:45.903
To marry, and take
one's place in society.

26:45.905 --> 26:49.039
But there's more to life
than that, isn't there?

26:50.342 --> 26:51.342
[footsteps]

26:51.344 --> 26:53.143
You'll never guess
where I've--

26:53.145 --> 26:54.345
[trails off]:
...Been.

26:54.347 --> 26:55.913
Where, exactly?

26:55.915 --> 26:57.915
Nowhere.

26:57.917 --> 26:59.016
Please, julie.

26:59.018 --> 27:00.384
I saw you sneak
in the side door.

27:00.386 --> 27:01.652
I have
a very good view

27:01.654 --> 27:03.187
From the window
in my room.

27:03.189 --> 27:04.655
You're always
spying on me!

27:04.657 --> 27:05.723
Because
you seem determined

27:05.725 --> 27:07.358
To bring shame
to our family.

27:07.360 --> 27:10.060
And you seem determined
to make sure I die an old maid!

27:10.062 --> 27:12.162
All right.

27:12.164 --> 27:13.864
Let me.

27:13.866 --> 27:15.599
Please talk
some sense into her.

27:18.536 --> 27:20.037
[mouths words]

27:24.042 --> 27:25.042
Where were you?

27:25.044 --> 27:27.344
I went dancing
with tom thornton!

27:27.346 --> 27:29.580
Julie! That is
completely inappropriate,

27:29.582 --> 27:31.048
And you know it.

27:31.050 --> 27:33.751
There's nothing inappropriate
about being in love.

27:33.753 --> 27:35.319
Well, at least
tell me

27:35.321 --> 27:37.021
That you had
a chaperone, then.

27:37.023 --> 27:38.355
Why would I
need a chaperone?

27:38.357 --> 27:41.558
Because you're a young lady
and you barely know him.

27:41.560 --> 27:43.327
I know him better
than you think.

27:43.329 --> 27:45.095
This is our second
secret rendezvous.

27:47.165 --> 27:48.132
You mustn't tell
mother and father.

27:48.134 --> 27:49.533
If they don't
approve of jack,

27:49.535 --> 27:51.402
Imagine what
they'll say about tom.

27:53.571 --> 27:55.806
What have they said
about jack?

27:55.808 --> 27:57.041
It's not
what they said,

27:57.043 --> 27:59.843
It's just obvious
how they feel.

27:59.845 --> 28:01.512
But they don't matter,

28:01.514 --> 28:03.981
What matters
is how you feel.

28:03.983 --> 28:05.916
[â™ª]

28:10.822 --> 28:12.723
[fire crackling]

28:17.062 --> 28:18.495
<i>Bon appetit.</i>

28:18.497 --> 28:20.297
[gasps] berries!

28:20.299 --> 28:23.000
How... Wonderful.

28:23.002 --> 28:24.635
And light!

28:24.637 --> 28:26.970
[chuckles]

28:32.343 --> 28:33.510
You know,
you never told me

28:33.512 --> 28:35.479
How things
went in hamilton.

28:35.481 --> 28:37.347
Oh, they went fine.

28:37.349 --> 28:39.717
Jack...

28:39.719 --> 28:42.286
You came back
and elizabeth didn't.

28:42.288 --> 28:44.822
Is she ever?

28:44.824 --> 28:46.623
Of course she is.

28:46.625 --> 28:50.060
Have you heard from her
since you've been home?

28:50.062 --> 28:51.528
I'm not worried, rosie.

28:51.530 --> 28:53.997
Of course not.

28:53.999 --> 28:55.866
I'm sure her mother
is on the mend

28:55.868 --> 28:58.635
And she's enjoying home
and family.

29:00.405 --> 29:03.640
I wonder if that prestigious
teaching position

29:03.642 --> 29:04.975
Was offered
to her again.

29:04.977 --> 29:07.377
Well, she turned
that job down once.

29:07.379 --> 29:09.213
But a woman can
always change her mind.

29:09.215 --> 29:11.081
She won't.

29:13.017 --> 29:15.953
I just think you should
consider the possibility,

29:15.955 --> 29:17.855
Unlikely
as it may seem...

29:19.657 --> 29:22.292
...That elizabeth
might not come back.

29:22.294 --> 29:24.995
And if, god forbid,
that should happen,

29:24.997 --> 29:26.563
Do remember

29:26.565 --> 29:29.967
That you have friends
that deeply care about you.

29:29.969 --> 29:32.136
Friends
you can rely upon.

29:36.407 --> 29:38.909
[exhales and shivers]

29:38.911 --> 29:40.077
Cold?

29:44.849 --> 29:47.084
No! What about you?
You'll freeze.

29:47.086 --> 29:49.620
I'll stay close
to the fire.

29:49.622 --> 29:52.022
Always the gentleman.

29:53.558 --> 29:55.793
[â™ª]

30:01.332 --> 30:02.733
Rosie--

30:02.735 --> 30:04.201
Jack?

30:04.203 --> 30:06.136
Please?

30:07.906 --> 30:09.807
Just for a moment.

30:11.576 --> 30:13.777
[â™ª]

30:16.915 --> 30:19.583
We should
get some sleep.

30:26.324 --> 30:28.725
Goodnight, jack.

30:28.727 --> 30:31.628
'night, rosie.

30:31.630 --> 30:33.463
[â™ª]

30:37.902 --> 30:39.336
[frank]:
These are good men

30:39.338 --> 30:42.005
And they ask
that you bless this enterprise

30:42.007 --> 30:44.708
And allow them
to do the good, honest work

30:44.710 --> 30:47.211
That brought them
to this beautiful valley.

30:47.213 --> 30:49.813
In the lord's name...

30:49.815 --> 30:51.415
Amen.

30:51.417 --> 30:53.383
[men, overlapping]: Amen.

30:57.322 --> 30:59.022
[indistinct chatter]

30:59.024 --> 31:01.225
You don't look convinced.

31:01.227 --> 31:03.026
In my experience,

31:03.028 --> 31:05.696
I find that when
I encounter a problem,

31:05.698 --> 31:08.198
The only one I can
rely on to fix it

31:08.200 --> 31:09.867
Is me.

31:11.502 --> 31:14.037
You're a self-made man,
mr. Coulter,

31:14.039 --> 31:16.073
And you should
be proud of that.

31:16.075 --> 31:18.675
But no one does it alone.

31:18.677 --> 31:20.544
We all need
help at times.

31:29.187 --> 31:31.054
How long
has she been seeing him?

31:31.056 --> 31:32.623
About a week.

31:32.625 --> 31:33.657
But for julie,

31:33.659 --> 31:35.659
It's always
love at first sight.

31:35.661 --> 31:37.828
There's nothing wrong
with being a romantic.

31:37.830 --> 31:39.863
Except it's always
with someone disastrous.

31:39.865 --> 31:43.166
And this tom fellow
is a disaster?

31:43.168 --> 31:45.469
Let's just say he's had
his fair share of troubles.

31:45.471 --> 31:48.038
But you know
his brother quite well.

31:48.040 --> 31:50.007
They're nothing alike.

31:50.009 --> 31:52.075
It can be hard
to tell someone else

31:52.077 --> 31:53.810
Whom to fall
in love with.

31:53.812 --> 31:55.812
I just don't want her
to make a mistake.

31:55.814 --> 31:57.047
If you care about her,

31:57.049 --> 31:58.749
You might have to let her
find these things out

31:58.751 --> 31:59.883
On her own.

31:59.885 --> 32:01.351
I'm not so sure
about that.

32:01.353 --> 32:02.686
Sometimes, it takes

32:02.688 --> 32:06.123
Making a mistake or two
in order for us to learn.

32:06.125 --> 32:07.124
What if
she gets hurt?

32:07.126 --> 32:08.325
As long as she has

32:08.327 --> 32:10.527
People around her
who love her,

32:10.529 --> 32:12.095
She'll be all right.

32:13.698 --> 32:14.731
Abigail.

32:16.167 --> 32:18.335
Have you heard anything
new about clara?

32:18.337 --> 32:20.070
Nothing yet.

32:20.072 --> 32:21.738
Constable avery
has assured me

32:21.740 --> 32:23.140
He's doing
everything he can.

32:23.142 --> 32:24.341
I'm sure he is,

32:24.343 --> 32:25.876
But if there's anything
I can do to help,

32:25.878 --> 32:27.044
Don't ever hesitate to ask.

32:27.046 --> 32:29.046
Thank you, charles.

32:30.315 --> 32:32.983
I hate to run...
But duty calls.

32:32.985 --> 32:34.584
Of course.

32:34.586 --> 32:36.320
Thank you
for the advice.

32:36.322 --> 32:37.521
And for lunch.

32:41.859 --> 32:43.026
[door opens]

32:43.028 --> 32:45.062
He's certainly
a charming young man.

32:45.064 --> 32:47.230
He's one of my favorite people.

32:48.700 --> 32:50.934
You make
a very handsome couple.

32:53.071 --> 32:55.572
Gosh... You sound
just like my mother.

32:55.574 --> 32:57.407
I understand how she feels.

32:59.177 --> 33:00.978
About what?

33:00.980 --> 33:02.913
You have...

33:02.915 --> 33:05.382
So much life here,
elizabeth.

33:05.384 --> 33:07.584
So much opportunity.

33:07.586 --> 33:09.619
Now you sound
just like my father.

33:10.855 --> 33:11.888
You can't tell me

33:11.890 --> 33:13.824
You haven't enjoyed
being back in hamilton,

33:13.826 --> 33:15.659
With your family
and friends.

33:15.661 --> 33:18.528
I have!

33:18.530 --> 33:21.598
To tell you the truth,
I've enjoyed every moment.

33:23.001 --> 33:26.970
I'm so glad I was here
for viola's engagement.

33:26.972 --> 33:29.639
And seeing julie again...

33:29.641 --> 33:30.907
Just makes me
realize

33:30.909 --> 33:33.176
Me how much I miss her
when I'm gone.

33:33.178 --> 33:35.178
I can see
how close you are.

33:35.180 --> 33:36.880
[chuckles]

33:41.486 --> 33:43.720
It's strange.

33:45.223 --> 33:49.626
I came here to take care
of my mother, and...

33:49.628 --> 33:51.661
Now it feels like
there's part of me

33:51.663 --> 33:53.697
That's so comfortable...

33:54.866 --> 33:56.166
It feels like
it's almost wrong

33:56.168 --> 33:58.668
To be having
a good time.

33:58.670 --> 34:00.137
I should be serious,

34:00.139 --> 34:03.040
I should be thinking
about my students...

34:03.042 --> 34:05.142
You should be missing jack?

34:08.813 --> 34:11.415
[voice breaks]:
I do miss jack.

34:11.417 --> 34:13.984
I miss him very much.

34:17.488 --> 34:19.890
[â™ª]

34:27.899 --> 34:29.399
[calls out]:
Mr. Fletcher?

34:31.836 --> 34:33.503
Who wants to know?

34:33.505 --> 34:35.505
Constable william avery.

34:35.507 --> 34:36.873
I need to have
a word with you.

34:36.875 --> 34:38.308
About what?

34:38.310 --> 34:40.243
It's about a young woman
in your employment,

34:40.245 --> 34:42.045
One clara stanton.

34:42.047 --> 34:44.014
I spoke with her,

34:44.016 --> 34:47.050
And I'm concerned that
you might be breaking the law.

34:47.052 --> 34:49.186
And what law
would that be, constable?

34:49.188 --> 34:51.054
Forcing an employee
to work for slave wages is a--

34:51.056 --> 34:54.191
It's a blatant violation
of the labor statutes.

34:54.193 --> 34:57.561
I loaned
that young woman $500,

34:57.563 --> 35:00.697
And she agreed to work for me
until her debt was settled.

35:00.699 --> 35:01.965
Well, mr. Fletcher,

35:01.967 --> 35:03.967
I would think
working seven days a week

35:03.969 --> 35:06.503
For more than a year
would have paid you back by now,

35:06.505 --> 35:07.537
With interest.

35:07.539 --> 35:10.173
Sadly, it hasn't.
Is that all?

35:10.175 --> 35:12.976
No, sir.
One more thing.

35:14.579 --> 35:16.847
I'll be at your residence
in two hours

35:16.849 --> 35:18.748
To take miss stanton
from your property,

35:18.750 --> 35:19.983
At which point,

35:19.985 --> 35:21.718
You're going to give me
a signed document

35:21.720 --> 35:23.720
Releasing her of
any financial obligation to you.

35:23.722 --> 35:24.855
And if I don't?

35:24.857 --> 35:27.958
Well, then, sir,
you can have your day in court.

35:30.128 --> 35:31.995
And you can try
to convince a jury

35:31.997 --> 35:34.030
Why a man of your standing
in the community

35:34.032 --> 35:36.900
Would take advantage
of such a poor young widow.

35:36.902 --> 35:39.936
My friends at the paper
would love a story like that.

35:43.207 --> 35:45.575
[â™ª]

35:55.520 --> 35:57.654
[footsteps]

36:00.291 --> 36:04.461
[â™ª]

36:05.663 --> 36:07.631
[footsteps]

36:11.302 --> 36:12.669
[gasps] clara!

36:12.671 --> 36:14.237
I spoke
with her employer.

36:14.239 --> 36:15.972
The issue's
been resolved.

36:15.974 --> 36:17.207
Resolved? How?

36:17.209 --> 36:19.476
He no further
has a hold on her.

36:21.679 --> 36:23.914
Constable avery
was wonderful.

36:25.550 --> 36:27.117
I owe him
everything.

36:29.220 --> 36:32.155
[â™ª]

36:32.157 --> 36:33.890
I'm sorry

36:33.892 --> 36:36.526
I've been such
a burden, mrs. Stanton.

36:37.795 --> 36:40.030
I won't trouble you any further.

36:40.032 --> 36:43.466
Clara, you're free now.

36:43.468 --> 36:45.902
You can do
whatever you want...

36:47.338 --> 36:48.872
But the truth is,

36:48.874 --> 36:50.240
You're all the family
I have left,

36:50.242 --> 36:53.310
And the only living connection
I have to my son.

36:55.146 --> 36:58.215
I would like it very much
if you came home with me.

36:59.717 --> 37:00.884
[sob catches]

37:00.886 --> 37:02.519
Really?

37:02.521 --> 37:04.955
With all my heart.

37:04.957 --> 37:07.524
[sobs]

37:10.328 --> 37:12.963
[â™ª]

37:28.312 --> 37:31.047
[rosemary, grandly]:
Hello, hope valley!

37:31.049 --> 37:32.983
Yes, I have returned,

37:32.985 --> 37:34.484
Safe and sound,

37:34.486 --> 37:37.988
None the worse
from my harrowing ordeal--

37:37.990 --> 37:41.958
Thanks to this brave,
steadfast, rugged,

37:41.960 --> 37:43.893
Handsome mountie!

37:45.329 --> 37:47.097
[giggles]

37:48.532 --> 37:50.867
Do my eyes deceive me?

37:50.869 --> 37:53.069
Was she wearing
his clothes?

37:53.071 --> 37:55.071
Well, his jacket anyway.

37:55.073 --> 37:56.139
Shocking.

38:02.179 --> 38:03.613
[footsteps approaching]

38:13.157 --> 38:14.724
[gasps]

38:17.161 --> 38:19.095
You're leaving, aren't you?

38:22.166 --> 38:23.967
I'm sorry.

38:25.369 --> 38:27.037
Don't be.

38:29.373 --> 38:31.408
I know your search
isn't over.

38:34.645 --> 38:35.979
I hope you find

38:35.981 --> 38:38.048
The answers
you're looking for,

38:38.050 --> 38:39.883
No matter where
it takes you.

38:42.219 --> 38:44.054
[â™ª]

38:45.456 --> 38:47.590
[background chatter]

38:49.627 --> 38:50.894
Hey-hey!

38:50.896 --> 38:52.862
Pretty good shot, jack.

38:52.864 --> 38:54.998
Thanks.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.233
But you're gonna have to do
a lot better than that.

38:57.235 --> 38:58.702
Aw, take it easy
on him, pastor.

38:58.704 --> 38:59.869
Jack's a hero.

38:59.871 --> 39:01.371
No, I'm not.

39:02.640 --> 39:05.041
Well, you rescued
miss leveaux.

39:05.043 --> 39:06.876
Makes you a hero
in my book.

39:06.878 --> 39:08.244
And to show you
how grateful I am,

39:08.246 --> 39:09.646
I'm gonna donate
the rest of

39:09.648 --> 39:11.314
The lumber you need
to finish the church,

39:11.316 --> 39:14.317
Just as soon as the mill
is up and running, that is.

39:14.319 --> 39:15.785
You still having
trouble with that engine?

39:17.722 --> 39:21.658
Ah, well, the pastor here
laid a blessing on the mill,

39:21.660 --> 39:24.294
But unless the good lord
knows how to fix a diesel...

39:24.296 --> 39:26.796
Well, the lord works
in mysterious ways.

39:29.133 --> 39:31.134
[footsteps receding]

39:34.472 --> 39:37.841
So there's nothing we can say
to change your mind?

39:37.843 --> 39:39.075
Mother's recovered,

39:39.077 --> 39:41.511
And school recess
is almost over.

39:41.513 --> 39:43.713
I want to
get back to my students.

39:43.715 --> 39:45.715
Is it the children
you're going back to,

39:45.717 --> 39:47.417
Or the mountie?

39:47.419 --> 39:50.053
I suppose if
I'm being truthful...

39:51.222 --> 39:53.890
It's both.

39:53.892 --> 39:55.692
Elizabeth, my dear,

39:55.694 --> 39:57.394
You know we don't
like to interfere,

39:57.396 --> 39:58.995
But maybe it's time
for you to consider--

39:58.997 --> 40:00.296
-...A change.
-Please, father.

40:00.298 --> 40:02.198
The teaching assignment
at hope valley

40:02.200 --> 40:04.033
Was never meant to be permanent.

40:04.035 --> 40:06.302
Could be time to think of
moving on to something better.

40:06.304 --> 40:09.639
This is what's best for me.

40:09.641 --> 40:11.908
Maybe I'll feel differently
once I'm there,

40:11.910 --> 40:15.278
But I have to go back
and find out for myself.

40:18.716 --> 40:20.984
But can you at least respect

40:20.986 --> 40:22.886
That this is what
I need to do?

40:22.888 --> 40:25.121
Yes, of course
we can.

40:25.123 --> 40:29.325
You have our blessing
and our support,

40:29.327 --> 40:31.494
No matter where you are
or what you do.

40:31.496 --> 40:34.030
[â™ª]

40:34.032 --> 40:36.099
It's so hard to leave.

40:38.469 --> 40:40.069
I love you both so much.

40:42.907 --> 40:44.674
[sighs]

40:44.676 --> 40:46.543
I better start packing.

40:50.514 --> 40:52.715
[background chatter]

40:54.518 --> 40:56.519
You're having a rough day,
my friend.

40:56.521 --> 40:58.054
Next round's on me.

40:58.056 --> 40:59.956
Deal.

40:59.958 --> 41:03.326
[rain pounding]

41:03.328 --> 41:05.061
Looks rough
out there.

41:05.063 --> 41:07.197
[chuckles]: You bet.

41:07.199 --> 41:09.566
Animals are lining up
two by two.

41:09.568 --> 41:10.800
I was on my way to buxton,

41:10.802 --> 41:12.168
But all this rain
washed out the bridge.

41:12.170 --> 41:13.903
Had to take
the long way around.

41:13.905 --> 41:15.505
What takes you
to buxton?

41:15.507 --> 41:18.374
One of the engines
at the textile factory is down.

41:18.376 --> 41:19.809
I was supposed to
be there yesterday.

41:19.811 --> 41:21.177
You're a mechanic?

41:21.179 --> 41:23.646
Yes, sir.
Diesel mechanic.

41:25.382 --> 41:27.984
Um... [chuckles]

41:27.986 --> 41:29.419
Having some trouble
at the mill,

41:29.421 --> 41:31.955
Getting the diesel engine
up and running.

41:31.957 --> 41:34.624
I could take a look at it
in the morning, if you'd like.

41:34.626 --> 41:37.160
Yes! Yes!
I would like that very much.

41:37.162 --> 41:38.962
Thank you.

41:38.964 --> 41:41.631
You're welcome.

41:41.633 --> 41:44.000
[â™ª]

41:44.002 --> 41:45.368
Guess this means

41:45.370 --> 41:47.904
We'll be seeing you
in church on Sunday?

41:50.207 --> 41:51.474
Uh...

41:52.910 --> 41:55.512
[train bell clanging]

41:55.514 --> 41:57.247
Charles, it was
very sweet of you

41:57.249 --> 41:59.315
To drive us
to the station.

41:59.317 --> 42:01.417
I wouldn't miss the chance
of saying one last goodbye.

42:01.419 --> 42:03.953
I promise
I'll be back soon.

42:03.955 --> 42:06.256
I'm going to hold you to it.

42:07.391 --> 42:09.225
Clara's running late.

42:09.227 --> 42:10.560
Do you think she's
changed her mind?

42:10.562 --> 42:11.861
Not at all.

42:11.863 --> 42:13.630
[conductor]: All aboard!

42:13.632 --> 42:16.466
Abigail,
that's our train.

42:16.468 --> 42:18.301
She'll be here.

42:19.470 --> 42:21.004
Here she is.

42:21.006 --> 42:22.939
Clara!

42:25.876 --> 42:28.044
I hope
I didn't keep you waiting.

42:28.046 --> 42:30.079
Not at all,
but we have to hurry.

42:37.121 --> 42:38.855
Do I need to
tell you how much--

42:38.857 --> 42:40.056
Charles...

42:40.058 --> 42:43.059
Some things are
better left unspoken.

42:43.061 --> 42:45.862
[â™ª]

43:00.077 --> 43:02.845
[piano playing in saloon]

43:02.847 --> 43:05.048
[elizabeth]: It's so good
to see everyone.

43:05.050 --> 43:07.483
I'm so happy to be back.

43:07.485 --> 43:08.985
Oh, we're very happy
that you're back.

43:08.987 --> 43:11.888
And you must tell us
everything about hamilton.

43:11.890 --> 43:14.223
Oh! Well...

43:14.225 --> 43:15.725
It was so wonderful
catching up

43:15.727 --> 43:17.460
With my sisters
and parents,

43:17.462 --> 43:18.661
And friends.

43:18.663 --> 43:20.229
I understand
your mother was quite ill.

43:20.231 --> 43:21.531
How is she?

43:21.533 --> 43:23.967
Much better.
Thank you for asking.

43:23.969 --> 43:26.803
Well, I'm just glad
you're back in time

43:26.805 --> 43:28.738
For school to begin.

43:28.740 --> 43:29.839
I know the children
are looking forward to it.

43:29.841 --> 43:31.307
[laughs] are they?

43:32.977 --> 43:34.477
I've missed all
of them so much.

43:34.479 --> 43:36.479
And all of you.

43:36.481 --> 43:40.116
Though I presume you've missed
someone in particular the most.

43:41.485 --> 43:43.553
[â™ª]

43:45.055 --> 43:46.556
Well, I believe
miss thatcher

43:46.558 --> 43:48.524
Will be occupied for
the remainder of the evening.

43:48.526 --> 43:50.493
Shall we?

43:50.495 --> 43:53.396
[â™ª]

44:03.540 --> 44:05.842
I've been
looking for you.

44:05.844 --> 44:08.711
Yeah. I just got back in
from rock creek.

44:11.849 --> 44:13.816
It's good to see you.

44:13.818 --> 44:16.019
You too.

44:16.021 --> 44:17.954
[â™ª]

44:17.956 --> 44:18.955
One more dance.

44:18.957 --> 44:20.823
No! You said that
three dances ago,

44:20.825 --> 44:21.958
And now I am thirsty.

44:21.960 --> 44:23.326
May I please have
something to drink?

44:23.328 --> 44:25.962
Me too, please.
Thank you.

44:25.964 --> 44:27.563
[exhales deeply]

44:27.565 --> 44:30.733
Hey, who is the woman
that jack is talking to?

44:30.735 --> 44:33.036
Oh, well, that's elizabeth.

44:33.038 --> 44:35.038
The woman of the hour.

44:35.040 --> 44:37.874
Our dear
little school teacher.

44:37.876 --> 44:40.376
Mm. Do I detect
a note of jealousy?

44:40.378 --> 44:41.978
[chuckles]
now, don't be silly.

44:41.980 --> 44:44.013
I've never been jealous
of another woman.

44:44.015 --> 44:45.982
Never in my whole life.

44:45.984 --> 44:47.650
Really? I don't know...

44:47.652 --> 44:50.019
You and jack seem
pretty chummy to me.

44:50.021 --> 44:52.021
Now who's jealous?

44:52.023 --> 44:54.824
Mm. I've never been jealous
a day in my life, either.

44:54.826 --> 44:55.825
I'm just interested
in the history.

44:55.827 --> 44:58.294
Well, that's exactly
what it is-- history.

44:58.296 --> 44:59.962
Okay.

45:01.231 --> 45:03.366
[â™ª]

45:04.802 --> 45:06.469
The town must
just love elizabeth,

45:06.471 --> 45:08.638
To welcome her
like this.

45:08.640 --> 45:10.873
This is your home
now, too, clara.

45:10.875 --> 45:13.743
I'm glad you agreed
to come back with me.

45:13.745 --> 45:15.678
It's a fresh,
new start.

45:15.680 --> 45:17.313
I hope so.

45:17.315 --> 45:18.648
And thank you so much

45:18.650 --> 45:20.416
For giving me
a job at the cafe.

45:20.418 --> 45:21.884
Oh! There isn't anyone

45:21.886 --> 45:25.054
I would rather work
side-by-side with every day.

45:25.056 --> 45:26.456
[both chuckling]

45:26.458 --> 45:28.491
[â™ª]

45:28.493 --> 45:30.059
Here you go.

45:30.061 --> 45:31.027
Thank you!

45:31.029 --> 45:33.696
Mr. Coulter
was just telling me

45:33.698 --> 45:35.832
That his sawmill will
be opening tomorrow.

45:35.834 --> 45:36.833
"our" sawmill.

45:36.835 --> 45:38.034
As far as I'm concerned,

45:38.036 --> 45:39.502
The mill belongs
to everyone in this town.

45:39.504 --> 45:40.470
Including me?

45:40.472 --> 45:42.638
Especially you.

45:42.640 --> 45:44.474
In fact, tomorrow,
the first board we cut

45:44.476 --> 45:45.875
Is gonna be yours.

45:45.877 --> 45:47.510
Well, how about that?

45:47.512 --> 45:49.212
My very own board!

45:49.214 --> 45:51.147
I'm so honored!

45:51.149 --> 45:52.548
Oh, I love
this song.

45:52.550 --> 45:53.850
Lee, ask me
to dance.

45:53.852 --> 45:55.918
Rosemary, would you
like to dance?

45:55.920 --> 45:57.954
Hmm... Let me see.

45:57.956 --> 45:59.288
[laughs] yes!

45:59.290 --> 46:00.623
Okay! It's nice
to meet you.

46:00.625 --> 46:01.691
You too.

46:01.693 --> 46:03.559
[both chuckling]

46:03.561 --> 46:07.363
Oh... He seems like
an interesting character.

46:07.365 --> 46:09.999
Yeah.
He's a good man.

46:10.001 --> 46:13.903
[elizabeth]: And apparently
sweet on rosemary?

46:13.905 --> 46:15.071
Uh-huh.

46:15.073 --> 46:17.507
He couldn't have
been too pleased

46:17.509 --> 46:19.408
When our "brave
mountie" swooped in

46:19.410 --> 46:21.644
To save the town's
"cherished actress."

46:21.646 --> 46:23.913
Yeah, look,
elizabeth, about that--

46:23.915 --> 46:25.081
I'm teasing you.

46:26.350 --> 46:28.518
I've learned to take
everything that woman says

46:28.520 --> 46:30.787
With a shaker
full of salt.

46:30.789 --> 46:33.055
[â™ª]

46:35.626 --> 46:38.060
Aren't you going to
ask me to dance?

46:40.531 --> 46:42.431
No.

46:45.702 --> 46:47.236
Come for a walk
with me.

46:49.006 --> 46:51.207
[â™ª]

46:54.745 --> 46:56.579
Keep them closed.

46:56.581 --> 46:58.681
They are!

46:58.683 --> 47:00.883
Okay.

47:00.885 --> 47:02.885
Open.

47:08.192 --> 47:09.559
Oh, jack...

47:09.561 --> 47:11.661
It needs
a few finishing touches,

47:11.663 --> 47:15.031
But it'll be ready
by the time school starts.

47:15.033 --> 47:16.999
What do you think?

47:17.001 --> 47:19.402
Do you like it?

47:19.404 --> 47:21.571
You did that?

47:21.573 --> 47:23.940
I had help.

47:27.244 --> 47:28.678
[sighs]

47:28.680 --> 47:30.880
It's wonderful.

47:33.050 --> 47:34.951
Welcome home.

47:37.988 --> 47:41.057
Utensils on the left,
napkins on the right.

47:41.059 --> 47:43.159
I set the tables
a half-an-hour before we open.

47:43.161 --> 47:43.993
That shouldn't
be a problem.

47:43.995 --> 47:45.161
Good.

47:45.163 --> 47:47.196
Today's menu is simple--

47:47.198 --> 47:48.865
Roast chicken and ham steak.

47:48.867 --> 47:50.800
No sweet potatoes.

47:50.802 --> 47:52.168
Jason campbell will ask,

47:52.170 --> 47:54.971
And you'll have to remind him
that the ground froze this year,

47:54.973 --> 47:56.205
And the crop is late.

47:56.207 --> 47:57.707
No sweet potatoes.

47:57.709 --> 48:00.009
Now, we will be busy
the first hour we're open--

48:00.011 --> 48:02.178
Keep the coffee cups filled,
and they won't squawk.

48:02.180 --> 48:04.914
No potatoes.
Keep their coffee filled.

48:04.916 --> 48:06.983
Great. I'm gonna leave this
in your capable hands.

48:06.985 --> 48:08.150
Oh! And, uh,

48:08.152 --> 48:09.085
Friday is pay day.

48:09.087 --> 48:11.153
Oh! You don't
have to pay me.

48:11.155 --> 48:12.655
You have done so much
for me already.

48:12.657 --> 48:13.856
Clara...

48:13.858 --> 48:16.459
No matter where you go,
or what you do,

48:16.461 --> 48:18.961
You mustn't let people
take advantage of you.

48:18.963 --> 48:21.998
Always
remember that.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.533
[â™ª]

48:26.503 --> 48:29.138
One down...
Thousands to go.

48:29.140 --> 48:30.673
All right,
take it to the saloon, boys.

48:30.675 --> 48:32.675
Make sure everyone signs it,
all right?

48:32.677 --> 48:34.911
Gowen. You're just in time.

48:34.913 --> 48:36.879
In time for what?

48:36.881 --> 48:39.548
Despite your best efforts,
the mill is up and running.

48:39.550 --> 48:42.518
That there
is our first board.

48:42.520 --> 48:43.786
Congratulations.

48:43.788 --> 48:45.855
Don't pretend
you're happy for us.

48:45.857 --> 48:48.057
You've been gouging me with fees
and drowning me in paperwork

48:48.059 --> 48:49.558
Since I got here.

48:49.560 --> 48:51.861
I only have the best interest
of this town in mind.

48:51.863 --> 48:54.897
The only interest
you have in mind is your own.

48:54.899 --> 48:57.466
But that doesn't concern me.

48:57.468 --> 49:00.369
Because I'm gonna do more
for this town than you ever did.

49:00.371 --> 49:02.805
The mill...
It's just the beginning.

49:04.641 --> 49:06.475
Good morning.

49:07.811 --> 49:10.146
I assume
constable thornton

49:10.148 --> 49:11.814
Showed you
the new school?

49:11.816 --> 49:13.983
He's done such a wonderful job.

49:13.985 --> 49:15.184
You have no idea.

49:15.186 --> 49:17.019
That man was pounding nails

49:17.021 --> 49:18.955
Like he was noah
bracing for the flood.

49:18.957 --> 49:20.957
[giggles]

49:20.959 --> 49:23.359
He wanted to get it finished
before you came home.

49:23.361 --> 49:25.194
[door opens]

49:25.196 --> 49:26.629
[door shuts]

49:26.631 --> 49:28.998
Good morning, ladies.

49:29.000 --> 49:30.399
[overlapping]:
Good morning--

49:30.401 --> 49:31.867
...Constable.

49:31.869 --> 49:33.703
Chilly day today,
isn't it?

49:34.871 --> 49:36.238
It is.

49:43.480 --> 49:45.047
Oh! Mr. Harper.

49:45.049 --> 49:46.682
What brings you
to town?

49:46.684 --> 49:49.986
Ladies, uh, sorry to disturb,
um... Ahem.

49:49.988 --> 49:51.387
I'm in a bind.

49:51.389 --> 49:53.990
Uh, mrs. Blakeley, I was hoping
maybe you could help me.

49:53.992 --> 49:56.359
Of course.
As long as I can.

49:56.361 --> 49:58.194
You see,
my brother's fallen ill,

49:58.196 --> 50:00.830
And he has a ranch
just south of jameson

50:00.832 --> 50:03.399
And I need to go lend a hand
for a day.

50:03.401 --> 50:05.234
I was hoping maybe
you could look in on the kids

50:05.236 --> 50:06.402
While I was gone.

50:06.404 --> 50:08.037
Nellie can do
most of the chores,

50:08.039 --> 50:09.372
And patrick,
he tries his best,

50:09.374 --> 50:10.806
But I'd really just feel
more comfortable

50:10.808 --> 50:13.242
If there was somebody there
to watch over them.

50:13.244 --> 50:15.544
I'm sorry,
I would, if I could,

50:15.546 --> 50:17.646
But I have to take
my youngest to the doctor

50:17.648 --> 50:18.881
In buxton.

50:18.883 --> 50:21.283
Of course. Thank you.

50:23.420 --> 50:24.620
I could do it!

50:28.358 --> 50:29.825
Are you sure,
miss thatcher?

50:29.827 --> 50:31.060
I mean...

50:31.062 --> 50:34.530
It's an awful lot to take on
all by yourself.

50:34.532 --> 50:36.532
Mr. Harper, I may have
been raised in the city,

50:36.534 --> 50:39.635
But I am
a hope valley woman now.

50:39.637 --> 50:41.003
Besides, I'll have
nellie and patrick

50:41.005 --> 50:42.371
There to help me.

50:42.373 --> 50:45.207
Well... I mean,
it is only a day.

50:46.843 --> 50:48.544
Thank you.
I do appreciate it.

50:48.546 --> 50:50.046
It's my pleasure.

50:51.848 --> 50:54.216
[hushed]: Maybe you could
look in on her?

50:55.585 --> 50:58.020
I don't need anyone
to look in on me!

50:58.022 --> 50:59.822
And constable thornton
is far too busy

50:59.824 --> 51:01.390
To look after me.

51:01.392 --> 51:02.792
[pointedly]: Isn't he?

51:04.161 --> 51:06.395
[â™ª]

51:12.669 --> 51:14.904
[door opens and closes]

51:19.876 --> 51:21.644
The grade
and the geological look good.

51:21.646 --> 51:23.879
Prime location
for a railway spur.

51:23.881 --> 51:26.048
That's what
I like to hear.

51:26.050 --> 51:27.716
Taking orders left
right, and center.

51:27.718 --> 51:30.719
I guarantee I can fill
three rail cars a week.

51:30.721 --> 51:32.288
Railway makes money,

51:32.290 --> 51:33.656
I avoid having to
truck my lumber

51:33.658 --> 51:35.057
All the way over
to the mainline.

51:35.059 --> 51:36.459
And you can
guarantee those orders?

51:36.461 --> 51:37.893
Better believe I can.

51:37.895 --> 51:39.995
And business aside,

51:39.997 --> 51:41.897
Imagine what the spur
line's gonna mean

51:41.899 --> 51:43.399
For the people
of hope valley.

51:43.401 --> 51:45.468
Trains in
and out every week...

51:45.470 --> 51:47.970
It's exactly what this town's
been waiting for.

51:47.972 --> 51:49.305
I'll have to speak
to the chief engineer first,

51:49.307 --> 51:51.240
But I can't imagine
what would get in our way.

51:51.242 --> 51:53.342
Ahh. Good news
is my favorite kind.

51:53.344 --> 51:54.710
Can I buy you
a drink?

51:54.712 --> 51:55.878
We've got some work
to finish up.

51:55.880 --> 51:57.313
Track me down
this afternoon.

51:57.315 --> 51:58.380
Okay. Deal.

51:58.382 --> 51:59.849
Oh, and ken?

51:59.851 --> 52:01.984
Let's just we keep this
between you and me for now.

52:01.986 --> 52:03.652
I understand.

52:03.654 --> 52:05.654
Okay. Excellent.
Thank you!

52:09.359 --> 52:10.826
Oh, what else... Oh!

52:10.828 --> 52:12.328
Watch the door
on the chicken pen.

52:12.330 --> 52:14.897
The latch tends to falls open
if you don't pin it shut.

52:14.899 --> 52:17.032
And believe me,
you do not want to wake up

52:17.034 --> 52:19.902
With chickens scattered
all over hell's half-acre.

52:19.904 --> 52:21.370
No. Of course not!

52:21.372 --> 52:23.372
Just keep
the animals fed,

52:23.374 --> 52:24.707
And you'll be fine.

52:24.709 --> 52:26.008
The kids'll fill you in
on anything else.

52:26.010 --> 52:27.009
The indoor chores, dad?

52:27.011 --> 52:29.578
Oh. Yeah. It's gonna get
real cold at night,

52:29.580 --> 52:31.514
So I'd get the fire going
first thing in the morning.

52:31.516 --> 52:32.515
At about what time?

52:32.517 --> 52:33.916
4:00 would be good.

52:33.918 --> 52:35.084
4:00 a.M.?

52:35.086 --> 52:36.519
Mm-hmm. And remember
to secure the door

52:36.521 --> 52:37.953
When you go to bed.

52:37.955 --> 52:39.488
We have
a couple coyotes around here

52:39.490 --> 52:40.689
Who think they're house pets.

52:40.691 --> 52:41.790
Coyotes?

52:41.792 --> 52:43.392
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah, but...

52:43.394 --> 52:45.794
They're not strong enough
to break down the door.

52:45.796 --> 52:46.862
If it's locked.

52:49.166 --> 52:49.999
And...

52:50.001 --> 52:51.500
You might want to wear

52:51.502 --> 52:54.003
Something a little less dear
to your heart.

52:54.005 --> 52:56.338
Oh, this will be fine,
I'm sure.

52:56.340 --> 52:58.007
Suit yourself.

52:58.009 --> 53:00.809
All right, kids,
you be good, you hear?

53:00.811 --> 53:03.379
Thank you, miss thatcher.
I do appreciate it.

53:03.381 --> 53:04.380
Have a safe trip.

53:04.382 --> 53:06.048
Thank you. Hyah!

53:07.184 --> 53:08.884
[splash]

53:11.621 --> 53:13.556
[both stifling their chuckles]

53:13.558 --> 53:15.424
[indignant gasp]

53:21.565 --> 53:22.865
Miss thatcher?

53:24.367 --> 53:25.367
Miss thatcher!

53:26.570 --> 53:28.003
[gasps]

53:28.005 --> 53:29.471
Are you okay?

53:30.874 --> 53:32.374
What are you doing up
at this hour?

53:32.376 --> 53:35.177
It's 4:00.
We always get up at this time.

53:35.179 --> 53:36.812
Already?

53:36.814 --> 53:38.514
[weary grunt]

53:38.516 --> 53:40.816
Shall we have some breakfast?

53:40.818 --> 53:42.384
Well, we have to do
the chores first.

53:42.386 --> 53:44.253
Oh. All right.

53:45.622 --> 53:46.789
What are they?

53:46.791 --> 53:48.624
We start
with mucking the stalls.

53:48.626 --> 53:51.393
[dozily]: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

53:51.395 --> 53:53.028
What's that?

53:53.030 --> 53:55.030
We clean up
after the cows and horses.

53:56.466 --> 53:57.866
Clean up what?

53:57.868 --> 53:59.735
You know...

53:59.737 --> 54:00.603
The muck.

54:03.573 --> 54:05.507
[realizing]: Oh...

54:05.509 --> 54:07.543
[â™ª]

54:09.379 --> 54:11.146
There. That wasn't so bad,
now, was it?

54:11.148 --> 54:12.348
[nellie groans wearily]

54:12.350 --> 54:14.383
You all right, patrick?

54:14.385 --> 54:15.684
[whines faintly]

54:15.686 --> 54:17.720
I didn't sleep too well.

54:17.722 --> 54:18.854
Why not?

54:18.856 --> 54:20.956
I'm not used to
my dad being away.

54:20.958 --> 54:22.524
Oh.

54:22.526 --> 54:25.594
Well, maybe a nice hot breakfast
will make you feel better.

54:30.967 --> 54:32.534
What?

54:32.536 --> 54:33.636
There's two more stalls to do.

54:34.971 --> 54:37.039
[â™ª]

54:38.508 --> 54:40.142
[snorts]

54:40.144 --> 54:41.610
[sighs]

54:45.181 --> 54:46.482
Wait! Where are you going?

54:46.484 --> 54:48.250
Well, I've got to go
get the biscuits ready.

54:48.252 --> 54:49.985
And I have to collect
eggs from the chickens

54:49.987 --> 54:51.487
So we have something to eat.

54:51.489 --> 54:53.355
But...

54:54.691 --> 54:55.958
[horse huffs]

54:57.360 --> 54:59.395
I told him
I had experience.

54:59.397 --> 55:00.829
I wrote my own
one-woman show.

55:00.831 --> 55:01.964
It was called

55:01.966 --> 55:04.033
"everything's
coming up rosie."

55:04.035 --> 55:05.200
[giggles proudly]

55:05.202 --> 55:06.368
Well, it was a commentary

55:06.370 --> 55:07.903
On being a successful
woman in the theater.

55:07.905 --> 55:09.805
And I must say,
I was wonderful.

55:09.807 --> 55:11.373
I received rave reviews!

55:11.375 --> 55:12.474
Well, what kind of things

55:12.476 --> 55:14.643
Will you be writing
for the newspaper?

55:14.645 --> 55:16.578
Oh, it's all
terribly exciting.

55:16.580 --> 55:18.414
Mr. Bolt has given me
the coveted assignment

55:18.416 --> 55:21.650
Of writing
the advice column.

55:21.652 --> 55:23.619
It's all the rage
in london and new york.

55:25.155 --> 55:26.555
What kind of advice?

55:26.557 --> 55:28.824
Oh... Personal appearance.

55:28.826 --> 55:30.959
Affairs of the heart.
Entertaining!

55:30.961 --> 55:32.227
That sort of thing.

55:32.229 --> 55:34.530
I'm going to write one column
each week,

55:34.532 --> 55:36.065
And I'm calling it...

55:36.067 --> 55:37.333
"ask...

55:37.335 --> 55:38.967
Mary-rose."

55:38.969 --> 55:41.003
Oh, it's a pseudonym.

55:41.005 --> 55:43.539
All the well-known
advice columnists use one.

55:43.541 --> 55:44.573
"mary-rose"?

55:44.575 --> 55:45.641
Mm-hmm.

55:45.643 --> 55:46.642
Subtle.

55:46.644 --> 55:47.843
Now, tell me
what you think.

55:47.845 --> 55:49.745
Of course, I'll need
a quiet place to write,

55:49.747 --> 55:51.580
But my readers
will need somewhere

55:51.582 --> 55:52.915
To deliver their letters.

55:52.917 --> 55:54.483
I was thinking a box

55:54.485 --> 55:56.085
-Set outside--
-and you think

55:56.087 --> 55:57.986
...The women of hope valley
are going to take your advice?

55:57.988 --> 55:59.521
Of course.

55:59.523 --> 56:00.856
Why wouldn't they?

56:00.858 --> 56:04.727
My life is about
glamour and <i>romance!</i>

56:04.729 --> 56:06.895
I don't know why
I didn't think of it sooner.

56:08.231 --> 56:10.032
[clara]: Oh, no! The pie!

56:10.034 --> 56:11.467
Oh, dear...

56:11.469 --> 56:12.534
Oh! Hmm.

56:13.737 --> 56:14.837
Well, the last time

56:14.839 --> 56:16.739
There was talk
of a railroad coming this way,

56:16.741 --> 56:19.141
Mayor ramsey said the depot
would be east of town.

56:19.143 --> 56:21.310
Well, I showed the advance man
what I had in mind.

56:21.312 --> 56:22.711
He seemed pretty impressed.

56:22.713 --> 56:24.747
[jack]: Good. Any idea when
they start laying track?

56:24.749 --> 56:27.416
Well, I'll be meeting
with him later on.

56:27.418 --> 56:28.484
Well, good luck.

56:28.486 --> 56:30.219
Thank you.

56:30.221 --> 56:31.887
Can I warm that cup of coffee
up for you, mr. Coulter?

56:31.889 --> 56:33.021
Yes, please!

56:33.023 --> 56:34.890
So how's the new job
going, clara?

56:34.892 --> 56:37.359
It's going quite well,
thank you.

56:38.661 --> 56:39.895
-Let me get that.
--It's fine.

56:39.897 --> 56:41.697
-[gasps]
-oh!

56:43.066 --> 56:44.700
I'm so sorry.

56:44.702 --> 56:46.468
No. It's... Fine.

56:46.470 --> 56:47.302
Is there a problem?

56:48.738 --> 56:51.373
I poured coffee in
constable thornton's hat.

56:57.147 --> 56:59.381
Would you like
cream and sugar with that?

56:59.383 --> 57:02.151
I think it's fine
just the way it is.

57:02.153 --> 57:04.019
[both chuckling]

57:04.021 --> 57:04.953
Excuse me.

57:04.955 --> 57:06.021
Thank you, abigail.

57:12.395 --> 57:14.897
I'm sorry
I made such a mess.

57:14.899 --> 57:16.799
Oh, clara!
Accidents happen.

57:16.801 --> 57:18.133
Don't give it
a second thought.

57:18.135 --> 57:19.601
I've ruined your apron.

57:21.204 --> 57:25.007
Okay, well, so you're not
very good at waiting tables.

57:25.009 --> 57:26.809
We'll find
something else for you to do.

57:26.811 --> 57:28.076
Like what?

57:29.579 --> 57:30.646
Can you cook?

57:30.648 --> 57:32.748
I've had some experience.

57:32.750 --> 57:35.184
Okay, we'll give that a try.

57:35.186 --> 57:36.819
And this way,

57:36.821 --> 57:37.986
You don't have to worry about
dealing with the customers.

57:37.988 --> 57:39.288
All right.

57:39.290 --> 57:40.789
Okay.

57:40.791 --> 57:42.024
Well, why don't you get cleaned
up and we'll get started?

57:46.529 --> 57:47.529
Oh...

57:47.531 --> 57:49.431
[drip]

57:51.568 --> 57:53.402
Mr. Gowen?
Might I have a word?

57:53.404 --> 57:55.804
Mrs. Ramsey, of course.

57:55.806 --> 57:58.907
I understand your husband
is out of town.

57:58.909 --> 58:01.176
Selling...
Stoves, is it?

58:01.178 --> 58:03.045
Ice boxes, yes.

58:03.047 --> 58:04.079
Good for him.

58:04.081 --> 58:06.982
Must be a less stressful
line of work.

58:06.984 --> 58:08.684
I'm not here to talk
about my husband,

58:08.686 --> 58:10.018
Mr. Gowen.

58:10.020 --> 58:13.655
I overheard mr. Coulter
talking in the cafe.

58:13.657 --> 58:16.625
I may have some information
you might find useful.

58:18.394 --> 58:19.895
What kind of information?

58:21.297 --> 58:23.799
If there's one thing
I learned as the mayor's wife,

58:23.801 --> 58:25.300
It's never give something

58:25.302 --> 58:27.503
Without receiving something
in return.

58:27.505 --> 58:29.471
Well, I don't know
what I can offer you,

58:29.473 --> 58:33.642
But if your information
is useful...

58:33.644 --> 58:35.043
Perhaps we can help each other.

58:36.880 --> 58:39.081
[â™ª]

58:55.164 --> 58:56.431
Come on...

58:58.501 --> 59:00.602
[pump clunking]

59:04.741 --> 59:05.908
You're doing it wrong.

59:07.644 --> 59:09.311
I said you didn't
have to look in on me.

59:09.313 --> 59:10.679
Let me help.

59:10.681 --> 59:12.314
I think it's broken.

59:12.316 --> 59:14.383
Just...
Grab the handle.

59:15.518 --> 59:17.319
Is this really necessary?

59:17.321 --> 59:19.154
Yes.

59:20.356 --> 59:22.958
Bend your knees.

59:22.960 --> 59:26.128
And when you're ready,
lift all the way up.

59:26.130 --> 59:27.329
You mean all the way down?

59:27.331 --> 59:29.097
Up.

59:30.900 --> 59:32.668
All the way.

59:32.670 --> 59:34.169
And all
the way down.

59:34.171 --> 59:35.370
There you go.

59:35.372 --> 59:36.972
Again.

59:36.974 --> 59:38.340
And you're priming
the well head.

59:38.342 --> 59:40.609
There you go.
One more.

59:42.078 --> 59:43.045
Yes.

59:44.314 --> 59:45.314
Good.

59:45.316 --> 59:47.082
Oh... This is
a new low point.

59:47.084 --> 59:50.085
I couldn't even figure out
how to pump water!

59:50.087 --> 59:50.986
Well, no one said

59:50.988 --> 59:53.121
Life on a homestead
would be easy.

59:53.123 --> 59:55.290
I didn't expect
it to be easy,

59:55.292 --> 59:56.959
But I didn't expect
it to be like this.

59:56.961 --> 59:57.993
Then this probably

59:57.995 --> 59:59.962
Isn't the best time
to tell you

59:59.964 --> 1:00:01.964
That I just got a telegram
from mr. Harper.

1:00:01.966 --> 1:00:02.898
He's been
delayed a day.

1:00:02.900 --> 1:00:05.334
Another day?

1:00:05.336 --> 1:00:06.969
That's why
I'm here to help.

1:00:06.971 --> 1:00:09.738
Jack, I can't
ask you to help.

1:00:10.907 --> 1:00:12.874
[â™ª]

1:00:14.177 --> 1:00:15.043
That's better.

1:00:17.413 --> 1:00:19.815
Why don't you go inside
and start dinner,

1:00:19.817 --> 1:00:21.917
And I'll take care
of things out here?

1:00:23.886 --> 1:00:25.954
Thank you, jack.

1:00:25.956 --> 1:00:26.955
You're welcome.

1:00:28.491 --> 1:00:31.193
[â™ª]

1:00:44.307 --> 1:00:45.207
Mr. Maclean.

1:00:46.676 --> 1:00:47.876
Mr. Gowen.

1:00:47.878 --> 1:00:49.044
Long time.

1:00:52.515 --> 1:00:53.682
What brings you
to hope valley?

1:00:53.684 --> 1:00:57.152
Well, I had some railroad
business to attend to.

1:00:57.154 --> 1:00:58.887
I hear you're the new mayor
in town.

1:00:58.889 --> 1:00:59.888
You heard right.

1:00:59.890 --> 1:01:01.356
Congratulations.

1:01:01.358 --> 1:01:02.524
Thank you.

1:01:02.526 --> 1:01:03.825
Well, we have a lot
to talk about.

1:01:03.827 --> 1:01:05.327
Why don't we
get a drink?

1:01:05.329 --> 1:01:06.728
I would...

1:01:06.730 --> 1:01:08.530
But I'm expected in buxton
later this afternoon.

1:01:08.532 --> 1:01:10.165
One drink.

1:01:10.167 --> 1:01:13.068
After all, I practically
got you your first job

1:01:13.070 --> 1:01:15.537
With the railroad,
remember?

1:01:15.539 --> 1:01:17.439
All right.

1:01:24.180 --> 1:01:26.415
What is this,
miss thatcher?

1:01:26.417 --> 1:01:29.051
It's hearty vegetable stew.
Do you like it?

1:01:30.853 --> 1:01:32.154
[â™ª]

1:01:32.156 --> 1:01:33.989
Constable?

1:01:33.991 --> 1:01:37.693
Well, it hardly compares
to your chicken-fried steak.

1:01:38.961 --> 1:01:40.595
Very funny.

1:01:42.799 --> 1:01:44.066
I suppose
I could have a little more.

1:02:02.351 --> 1:02:03.719
[fork clatters]

1:02:03.721 --> 1:02:05.087
Nora.

1:02:05.089 --> 1:02:06.221
What are
you doing here?

1:02:06.223 --> 1:02:08.056
Surprised to see me, bill?

1:02:08.058 --> 1:02:10.959
I went looking for you
at mountie headquarters,

1:02:10.961 --> 1:02:12.828
And a constable told me
you were dining here.

1:02:12.830 --> 1:02:15.230
We need to talk.

1:02:15.232 --> 1:02:17.299
I met abigail stanton.

1:02:17.301 --> 1:02:19.067
So I heard.

1:02:19.069 --> 1:02:20.001
She had the audacity to say

1:02:20.003 --> 1:02:21.670
That you weren't wearing
your wedding ring

1:02:21.672 --> 1:02:23.038
When you met her.

1:02:23.040 --> 1:02:24.372
She claims she didn't
know you were married.

1:02:25.742 --> 1:02:26.975
-Nora--
-obviously was lying--

1:02:26.977 --> 1:02:29.144
But she didn't fool me,
not for one moment.

1:02:29.146 --> 1:02:31.046
Everything
she told you was true.

1:02:31.048 --> 1:02:32.514
Please don't protect her, bill.

1:02:32.516 --> 1:02:34.516
I'm sure it was very hard
to resist her charms.

1:02:34.518 --> 1:02:36.351
She's a very attractive woman.

1:02:36.353 --> 1:02:37.953
This isn't about her!
It's about us!

1:02:41.858 --> 1:02:44.059
[sighs wearily]

1:02:44.061 --> 1:02:46.862
Why are you making
such an issue of this now?

1:02:46.864 --> 1:02:48.897
What do you mean?

1:02:48.899 --> 1:02:51.500
After martin died,
things between us changed.

1:02:51.502 --> 1:02:52.734
Did you forget that?

1:02:53.870 --> 1:02:55.871
That was a very difficult
time for me.

1:02:55.873 --> 1:02:57.372
Yes! For both of us.

1:02:57.374 --> 1:02:58.540
But you left!

1:02:58.542 --> 1:02:59.808
For nearly two years,

1:02:59.810 --> 1:03:00.976
I didn't know
where you were.

1:03:00.978 --> 1:03:02.644
I never thought
I'd see you again.

1:03:02.646 --> 1:03:05.814
When I finally found you,
where were you, nora?

1:03:05.816 --> 1:03:08.383
I had to go back to my father.

1:03:08.385 --> 1:03:10.318
Yes. With him. Not me.

1:03:10.320 --> 1:03:12.287
You didn't even
want to see me.

1:03:12.289 --> 1:03:13.855
And why was that?

1:03:15.124 --> 1:03:15.991
Because you know,
as well as I do,

1:03:15.993 --> 1:03:17.292
Once we lost martin,

1:03:17.294 --> 1:03:19.261
There was no reason
for us to be together.

1:03:21.831 --> 1:03:24.866
I understand
that my leaving upset you,

1:03:24.868 --> 1:03:26.334
But I'm better now.

1:03:26.336 --> 1:03:27.969
And I think
we can try again.

1:03:27.971 --> 1:03:29.971
Nora, I tried
to be a good husband,

1:03:29.973 --> 1:03:32.307
I really did.

1:03:32.309 --> 1:03:34.309
But without martin...

1:03:34.311 --> 1:03:36.378
I just can't live the pretense
any longer.

1:03:38.014 --> 1:03:39.781
[â™ª]

1:03:40.917 --> 1:03:42.083
My father
is asking about you.

1:03:45.721 --> 1:03:47.122
How is jonas?

1:03:47.124 --> 1:03:48.857
He was quite sick.

1:03:48.859 --> 1:03:50.959
So I heard.

1:03:50.961 --> 1:03:52.127
But he's better now,

1:03:52.129 --> 1:03:54.896
And I know he'd like
very much to see you.

1:03:57.667 --> 1:03:59.000
Tell him...

1:03:59.002 --> 1:04:01.002
Ahem.

1:04:01.004 --> 1:04:03.638
When I'm finished
with the case I'm working on.

1:04:05.474 --> 1:04:07.809
That would be wonderful.
We can have dinner together.

1:04:07.811 --> 1:04:09.077
-Nora, I won't be--
-he's going to be--

1:04:09.079 --> 1:04:10.478
...So excited
when I tell him!

1:04:10.480 --> 1:04:11.813
-Nora--
-it's getting late.

1:04:11.815 --> 1:04:13.415
I'd better get going,
and father's waiting for me.

1:04:13.417 --> 1:04:14.883
Nora, I'm not
going to be having dinner.

1:04:17.019 --> 1:04:18.854
Just to visit jonas.

1:04:18.856 --> 1:04:22.290
It'll be wonderful
to have you at the house.

1:04:22.292 --> 1:04:25.727
And we'll be able
to talk more about the future.

1:04:28.631 --> 1:04:30.932
Thank you, bill.

1:04:33.302 --> 1:04:35.303
[â™ª]

1:04:39.208 --> 1:04:42.043
[clara]: Thank you very much.
Have a lovely evening.

1:04:45.081 --> 1:04:47.015
"dear mary-rose...

1:04:47.017 --> 1:04:49.084
"my husband and I
have been happily married

he seems distant.

more attentive to his needs?

I just want him to be happy.
Please help."

[sighs]
oh, margaret burns.

1:05:04.735 --> 1:05:06.968
For heaven's sakes,
I thought better of you.

1:05:06.970 --> 1:05:09.871
Aren't these
supposed to be anonymous?

1:05:09.873 --> 1:05:10.906
Oh, please!

1:05:10.908 --> 1:05:12.707
Who else would write
a question like that?

1:05:12.709 --> 1:05:14.242
"dear...

What?

1:05:32.129 --> 1:05:33.862
You disagree?

1:05:33.864 --> 1:05:35.497
Not at all, but...

1:05:35.499 --> 1:05:37.899
Perhaps your readership
isn't ready

1:05:37.901 --> 1:05:39.334
For such...

1:05:39.336 --> 1:05:40.302
Progressive

1:05:40.304 --> 1:05:41.670

Miss leveaux.

1:05:42.673 --> 1:05:43.872
If you print
that advice,

1:05:43.874 --> 1:05:45.807
You'll cause
a mighty fine ruckus.

1:05:45.809 --> 1:05:47.475
Well, good!

1:05:47.477 --> 1:05:49.144
Maybe this town
needs a little ruckus.

1:05:49.146 --> 1:05:50.879
I would like to see

1:05:50.881 --> 1:05:54.249
A man spend one day trying
to do what a woman does.

1:05:54.251 --> 1:05:55.483
I couldn't agree more,

1:05:55.485 --> 1:05:58.820
But perhaps you should
ease into your column.

1:05:58.822 --> 1:05:59.921
Mrs. Ramsey.

1:06:01.624 --> 1:06:03.992
When was the last time
mr. Ramsey took you in his arms

1:06:03.994 --> 1:06:05.327
And told you
that he loved you?

1:06:05.329 --> 1:06:06.962
[mrs. Ramsey gasps quietly]

1:06:06.964 --> 1:06:08.730
When was the last time
he kissed you so deeply,

1:06:08.732 --> 1:06:10.398
That your body
tingled all over?

1:06:10.400 --> 1:06:11.566
-I beg your pardon!
-[florence coughing]

1:06:11.568 --> 1:06:13.335
It's a simple question.

1:06:13.337 --> 1:06:16.004
When was the last time
he swept you off your feet?

1:06:16.006 --> 1:06:17.572
I really don't think

1:06:17.574 --> 1:06:18.640
We should be
talking about this.

1:06:18.642 --> 1:06:19.674
Florence.

1:06:19.676 --> 1:06:21.042
How can you say such a thing?

1:06:21.044 --> 1:06:22.744
Of course, we should be
talking about it.

1:06:22.746 --> 1:06:24.245
We all should!

1:06:24.247 --> 1:06:27.048
There are enough
taboo subjects in the world.

1:06:27.050 --> 1:06:29.918
Romance between a woman
and her husband

1:06:29.920 --> 1:06:31.453
Shouldn't be one of them.

1:07:05.822 --> 1:07:07.722
[coyote howls]

1:07:08.891 --> 1:07:11.359
You didn't sleep
very well last night.

1:07:15.131 --> 1:07:17.065
You must be
very tired.

1:07:18.534 --> 1:07:19.934
Are you worried
about something?

1:07:22.571 --> 1:07:25.006
I-I'm afraid of the dark.

1:07:25.008 --> 1:07:26.708
Ah.

1:07:26.710 --> 1:07:29.044
You know...

1:07:29.046 --> 1:07:30.845
I used to be
scared of the dark, too.

1:07:30.847 --> 1:07:32.047
No, you weren't!

1:07:32.049 --> 1:07:33.314
Yes, I was!

1:07:33.316 --> 1:07:36.518
When I was a girl,
just about your age,

1:07:36.520 --> 1:07:39.020
I used to make my father
check in the closets,

1:07:39.022 --> 1:07:40.889
And behind the door,
and under the bed.

1:07:40.891 --> 1:07:42.490
Did he ever find anything?

1:07:42.492 --> 1:07:44.559
No. And do you know why?

1:07:46.529 --> 1:07:48.096
Because it was all right here.

1:07:52.501 --> 1:07:55.870
My father used to say that
I had a wonderful imagination,

1:07:55.872 --> 1:07:58.073
And that must mean

1:07:58.075 --> 1:08:01.042
That you have
a wonderful imagination, too.

1:08:02.545 --> 1:08:04.012
So...

1:08:04.014 --> 1:08:06.815
The next time you get scared,

1:08:06.817 --> 1:08:08.850
I want you
to use your imagination

1:08:08.852 --> 1:08:11.252
And think of something
that makes you happy.

1:08:12.788 --> 1:08:14.856
[â™ª]

1:08:17.126 --> 1:08:19.961
I used to imagine that...

1:08:19.963 --> 1:08:21.396
The stars in the sky

1:08:21.398 --> 1:08:25.033
Were the eyes of
all the people in heaven...

1:08:25.035 --> 1:08:28.703
Watching over me
and keeping me safe.

1:08:31.173 --> 1:08:33.775
I think
they're watching over you, too--

1:08:36.045 --> 1:08:37.979
[â™ª]

1:08:56.465 --> 1:08:59.067
I have never been...

1:08:59.069 --> 1:09:01.169
Quite so exhausted...

1:09:01.171 --> 1:09:03.505
In all of my life.

1:09:03.507 --> 1:09:06.074
[chuckles]

1:09:08.410 --> 1:09:09.644
You were great
in there with patrick.

1:09:10.813 --> 1:09:13.014
Oh. You heard that,
did you?

1:09:13.016 --> 1:09:15.083
Mm-hmm.

1:09:16.352 --> 1:09:17.852
From hamilton
to hope valley,

1:09:17.854 --> 1:09:20.054
To the homestead...

1:09:20.056 --> 1:09:22.290
If they could
see you now.

1:09:24.527 --> 1:09:26.794
I thought I managed
quite well today,

1:09:26.796 --> 1:09:27.862
Thank you very much.

1:09:27.864 --> 1:09:30.298
You did.

1:09:38.641 --> 1:09:41.075
You seemed
rather at ease.

1:09:41.077 --> 1:09:42.177
[chuckles]

1:09:42.179 --> 1:09:44.045
Where'd you learn
to be so handy?

1:09:47.349 --> 1:09:49.317
My uncle had
a ranch back east,

1:09:49.319 --> 1:09:50.585
And when
my father died,

1:09:50.587 --> 1:09:52.253
He took us in.

1:09:52.255 --> 1:09:54.489
Gave my ma
time to grieve.

1:09:56.458 --> 1:09:57.692
And for two young boys,

1:09:57.694 --> 1:09:59.727
There's no better place
to find trouble.

1:10:01.664 --> 1:10:02.964
It was hard work, though,

1:10:02.966 --> 1:10:04.866
But we loved it.

1:10:06.502 --> 1:10:08.736
My uncle even
offered me the ranch.

1:10:16.412 --> 1:10:19.013
Why didn't you
take it?

1:10:19.015 --> 1:10:20.782
It wasn't my calling.

1:10:22.351 --> 1:10:24.886
How did you know?

1:10:24.888 --> 1:10:26.754
I just knew.

1:10:28.324 --> 1:10:29.857
I love
this kind of work, though.

1:10:29.859 --> 1:10:31.893
It gives me perspective,

1:10:31.895 --> 1:10:34.295
Which is hard to come by
these days.

1:10:36.799 --> 1:10:38.900
I don't know. Maybe...

1:10:40.336 --> 1:10:42.437
Maybe one day,
I'll get a farm of my own.

1:10:44.873 --> 1:10:47.041
An old house...

1:10:47.043 --> 1:10:48.676
Dew on the grass,

1:10:48.678 --> 1:10:51.145
Waking up to the rooster
in the morning.

up and down the stairs.

with someone I love.

1:11:44.667 --> 1:11:46.334
So, you're the new man?

1:11:46.336 --> 1:11:47.702
That's right.

1:11:47.704 --> 1:11:49.637
What have you got?

I hear
you've been very helpful.

1:12:02.018 --> 1:12:03.851
I could
be more helpful.

1:12:03.853 --> 1:12:06.154
You work for
the crenshaw brothers.

1:12:06.156 --> 1:12:08.856
I know of some...

1:12:08.858 --> 1:12:11.025
Opportunities
they may be interested in.

1:12:11.027 --> 1:12:13.194
There's some risk involved,
but, as they say,

1:12:13.196 --> 1:12:14.729
The greater the risk...

1:12:14.731 --> 1:12:17.065
The greater the reward.

1:12:24.873 --> 1:12:26.207
This isn't the amount
we agreed to.

1:12:26.209 --> 1:12:27.975
You'll get the rest,

1:12:27.977 --> 1:12:29.944
If these are
what you say they are.

1:12:31.647 --> 1:12:34.082
[â™ª]

1:12:35.417 --> 1:12:37.318
[engine starts]

1:12:46.628 --> 1:12:48.329
I promise,

1:12:48.331 --> 1:12:50.198
Most days will not
be that busy.

1:12:50.200 --> 1:12:52.133
I promise
that I will pay you back

1:12:52.135 --> 1:12:53.334
For the dishes
that I broke.

1:12:53.336 --> 1:12:54.335
That's not necessary.

1:12:54.337 --> 1:12:55.403
It is.

1:12:55.405 --> 1:12:57.839
I don't want
to be a burden to you.

1:12:57.841 --> 1:12:58.940
You have been so generous.

1:13:00.576 --> 1:13:01.943
Can I show you something?

1:13:17.025 --> 1:13:18.126
What is it?

1:13:19.461 --> 1:13:21.929
This belonged to peter.

1:13:25.067 --> 1:13:26.834
He loved baseball.

1:13:26.836 --> 1:13:30.037
Used to play in the street
with his friends every day.

1:13:30.039 --> 1:13:31.839
Broke three windows
with this ball.

1:13:31.841 --> 1:13:33.007
[laughing]

1:13:33.009 --> 1:13:36.077
And I would scold him
and take it away from him.

1:13:37.246 --> 1:13:39.347
Looking back,

1:13:39.349 --> 1:13:41.916
I should've let him break
as many windows as he wanted.

1:13:45.254 --> 1:13:46.888
He was my family...

1:13:48.357 --> 1:13:49.690
And now he's gone.

1:13:53.495 --> 1:13:57.365
So you can break as many dishes
as you want, clara.

1:13:58.700 --> 1:14:01.035
Because you are my family now.

1:14:03.539 --> 1:14:05.573
[â™ª]

1:14:08.343 --> 1:14:09.977
[footsteps]

1:14:09.979 --> 1:14:12.914
Good morning!

1:14:12.916 --> 1:14:15.016
I missed chores?

1:14:15.018 --> 1:14:16.517
I'm sorry.

1:14:16.519 --> 1:14:17.985
Oh, that's all right.

1:14:17.987 --> 1:14:20.421
Why don't you sit down?
I made you some breakfast.

1:14:23.125 --> 1:14:24.292
Here you go.

1:14:24.294 --> 1:14:25.493
I know
you needed rest.

1:14:25.495 --> 1:14:26.894
How did you sleep?

1:14:26.896 --> 1:14:27.862
Really good.

1:14:27.864 --> 1:14:29.063
Thanks for helping me.

1:14:29.065 --> 1:14:30.998
You're welcome, patrick.

1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:32.800
[door creaks]
good morning.

1:14:34.136 --> 1:14:34.936
Morning.

1:14:37.339 --> 1:14:39.373
Someone's been busy
this morning.

1:14:39.375 --> 1:14:41.909
Yeah, I wanted to make sure
you had enough firewood

1:14:41.911 --> 1:14:43.411
Before I left to do my rounds.

1:14:43.413 --> 1:14:45.780
That looks like
more than enough.

1:14:47.015 --> 1:14:48.382
Did you sleep
all right?

1:14:48.384 --> 1:14:49.984
The floor in the barn

1:14:49.986 --> 1:14:52.086
Is softer than
my bed at the jail.

1:14:53.355 --> 1:14:54.188
I'm sorry about that.

1:14:54.190 --> 1:14:56.057
Was there another option?

1:14:58.227 --> 1:14:59.227
No.

1:14:59.229 --> 1:15:00.461
[chuckles]

1:15:00.463 --> 1:15:03.097
I'll be back this afternoon
to check on you.

1:15:04.633 --> 1:15:06.200
You don't have to do that.

1:15:06.202 --> 1:15:08.870
I know.

1:15:08.872 --> 1:15:11.372
It's okay. I can help her
with whatever she needs.

1:15:11.374 --> 1:15:12.907
I'll keep that in mind.

1:15:14.076 --> 1:15:15.109
Thank you, jack.

1:15:17.212 --> 1:15:19.013
You're welcome.

1:15:19.015 --> 1:15:20.548
For everything.

1:15:23.085 --> 1:15:25.319
[â™ª]

1:15:29.458 --> 1:15:30.858
Here they come.

1:15:30.860 --> 1:15:33.194
The great thing
about lumberjacks?

1:15:33.196 --> 1:15:35.062
They eat a lot.

1:15:35.064 --> 1:15:36.297
[laughs]

1:15:36.299 --> 1:15:37.665
I wanted to
say thank you,

1:15:37.667 --> 1:15:39.467
For last night.

1:15:39.469 --> 1:15:41.903
Oh, clara, you don't
have to thank me.

1:15:43.539 --> 1:15:45.773
I made this for you.

1:15:47.309 --> 1:15:48.976
Oh, clara...

1:15:48.978 --> 1:15:51.012
Clara, it's gorgeous.

1:15:51.014 --> 1:15:52.847
When did you make this?

1:15:52.849 --> 1:15:54.315
Last night.

1:15:54.317 --> 1:15:57.585
I felt bad about
the apron that I ruined.

1:15:57.587 --> 1:15:59.987
Oh...
This is excellent stitching.

1:15:59.989 --> 1:16:02.023
Where did you learn
to sew like this?

1:16:02.025 --> 1:16:04.325
Oh, it's just a hobby.

1:16:04.327 --> 1:16:06.861
Oh, I think
it's more than that.

1:16:06.863 --> 1:16:08.963
Clara, have you ever
considered dressmaking?

1:16:08.965 --> 1:16:10.731
[chuckles] oh...

1:16:16.505 --> 1:16:17.305
Gowen!

1:16:19.007 --> 1:16:20.508
You and I
need to talk.

1:16:20.510 --> 1:16:21.976
How can I help you?

1:16:21.978 --> 1:16:24.912
I just got a telegram
from ken maclean.

1:16:24.914 --> 1:16:26.480
It seems
the railroad company

1:16:26.482 --> 1:16:27.715
Wants to build
the spur line

1:16:27.717 --> 1:16:29.917
300 yards east of
where he and I surveyed.

1:16:29.919 --> 1:16:31.519
Is that a problem?

1:16:31.521 --> 1:16:32.887
I don't own
that right-of-way.

1:16:32.889 --> 1:16:34.155
Well, that is a problem.

1:16:34.157 --> 1:16:35.656
It's gonna be
a much bigger problem,

1:16:35.658 --> 1:16:36.891
If I find out
you own that land.

1:16:38.493 --> 1:16:41.062
I don't own the railway
company, mr. Coulter.

1:16:41.064 --> 1:16:42.530
They decide where they're gonna
put their spur line.

1:16:44.299 --> 1:16:46.734
My land was perfect,
and you know it.

1:16:46.736 --> 1:16:48.669
Someone got ken
to change his mind.

1:16:48.671 --> 1:16:49.971
You may remember
that I said

1:16:49.973 --> 1:16:52.073
One day
you might need my help?

1:16:52.075 --> 1:16:53.741
Perhaps that day has arrived.

1:16:55.177 --> 1:16:57.178
Should you wish
to discuss it further,

1:16:57.180 --> 1:16:59.046
You can make an appointment
with mrs. Ramsey.

1:16:59.048 --> 1:17:02.016
Mrs. Ramsey?
She works for you?

1:17:02.018 --> 1:17:04.218
I've hired her as
the mayor's personal secretary.

1:17:04.220 --> 1:17:05.853
She has been very helpful.

1:17:05.855 --> 1:17:08.222
Even knows how to type!

1:17:09.625 --> 1:17:12.426
[â™ª]

1:17:15.364 --> 1:17:16.964
[groans wearily]

1:17:18.567 --> 1:17:20.401
Are you two
finished already?

1:17:20.403 --> 1:17:22.003
Yeah, kitchen's all clean.

1:17:22.005 --> 1:17:22.903
And the pigs are all fed.

1:17:22.905 --> 1:17:24.171
Very good!

1:17:24.173 --> 1:17:25.740
[cock crows]

1:17:25.742 --> 1:17:28.042
Looks like you didn't
get much milk.

1:17:28.044 --> 1:17:30.845
Gertrude wasn't very...
Cooperative.

1:17:30.847 --> 1:17:32.913
Well, did you hold her tail
down, like I told you to?

1:17:32.915 --> 1:17:34.882
Yes.

1:17:34.884 --> 1:17:35.850
Did you warm up
your hands first?

1:17:35.852 --> 1:17:38.653
Didn't know
I was supposed to do that.

1:17:38.655 --> 1:17:41.022
Yeah, she doesn't really
like cold hands.

1:17:41.024 --> 1:17:42.657
I'll remember that.

1:17:42.659 --> 1:17:44.825
[wagon rumbling over gravel]

1:17:44.827 --> 1:17:45.860
[horse neighs]

1:17:47.229 --> 1:17:48.529
[nellie]: Look! It's dad!

1:17:48.531 --> 1:17:50.297
[elizabeth laughs]

1:17:53.201 --> 1:17:55.670
Whoa...

1:17:55.672 --> 1:17:57.638
Welcome home, mr. Harper.

1:17:57.640 --> 1:17:59.306
How were the kids?

1:17:59.308 --> 1:18:00.708
They were wonderful.

1:18:00.710 --> 1:18:01.642
Helped with all the chores.

1:18:01.644 --> 1:18:02.910
And you would be

1:18:02.912 --> 1:18:04.712
Very proud of patrick--
he slept quite well last night.

1:18:04.714 --> 1:18:06.380
Good to hear.

1:18:08.050 --> 1:18:09.917
Well, I hope
there's some breakfast left.

1:18:09.919 --> 1:18:11.052
Hyah.

1:18:12.721 --> 1:18:13.888
[gasps]

1:18:13.890 --> 1:18:16.190
[â™ª]

1:18:16.192 --> 1:18:18.959
[patrick]: Uh-oh.

1:18:18.961 --> 1:18:21.362
[all laughing]

1:18:24.499 --> 1:18:25.900
Listen.

1:18:25.902 --> 1:18:27.001
He looked me right in the eye

1:18:27.003 --> 1:18:28.669
And he said he had
nothing to do with it,

1:18:28.671 --> 1:18:30.905
But I know--
I know he did.

1:18:30.907 --> 1:18:33.074
You know, there are
some people in town

1:18:33.076 --> 1:18:35.843
That think gowen had a hand
in getting rid of the old mayor.

1:18:35.845 --> 1:18:37.311
You one of them?

1:18:37.313 --> 1:18:39.914
Why else would mayor ramsey
resign so suddenly,

1:18:39.916 --> 1:18:42.216
Then go on the road
to sell ice boxes?

1:18:44.853 --> 1:18:46.721
Okay, so, how
do we get rid of him?

1:18:46.723 --> 1:18:47.822
"we"?

1:18:47.824 --> 1:18:49.190
Well, you don't really think
he's the right guy

1:18:49.192 --> 1:18:50.257
To be running things
in hope valley, do you?

1:18:54.396 --> 1:18:56.030
It won't be easy.

1:18:56.032 --> 1:18:58.566
[â™ª]

1:18:58.568 --> 1:19:00.367
Well, he's gonna make
life difficult for you.

1:19:00.369 --> 1:19:02.303
Well, not any more
than he already has.

1:19:02.305 --> 1:19:03.704
You're gonna need evidence,

1:19:03.706 --> 1:19:06.173
People who are willing
to testify against him,

1:19:06.175 --> 1:19:07.575
Or you'll have to
start a petition,

1:19:07.577 --> 1:19:09.410
Get enough signatures
to force a recall vote.

1:19:09.412 --> 1:19:10.778
Well, I'll do
whatever it takes.

1:19:12.347 --> 1:19:13.547
Well...

1:19:13.549 --> 1:19:15.583
[words catch]

1:19:16.852 --> 1:19:17.985
Are you prepared
to lose everything

1:19:17.987 --> 1:19:19.553
You've worked so hard for?

1:19:19.555 --> 1:19:21.789
I'm not gonna lose anything...

1:19:21.791 --> 1:19:23.557
As long as
you're watching my back.

1:19:23.559 --> 1:19:25.359
Yes?

1:19:32.334 --> 1:19:33.901
[hooves pounding]

1:19:33.903 --> 1:19:36.370
Come on.

1:19:40.375 --> 1:19:42.042
Whoa.

1:19:47.349 --> 1:19:48.983
Thank you.

1:19:53.789 --> 1:19:54.955
To be honest,

1:19:54.957 --> 1:19:56.690
I'm a little
disappointed.

1:19:56.692 --> 1:19:57.892
Why?

1:19:57.894 --> 1:20:00.394
I don't think you need
riding lessons anymore.

1:20:04.166 --> 1:20:06.066
Doesn't mean
I won't ask for them.

1:20:12.507 --> 1:20:14.408
I'm proud of you.

1:20:17.045 --> 1:20:19.313
You really stepped up
for mr. Harper and his kids.

1:20:19.315 --> 1:20:20.447
Oh...

1:20:21.583 --> 1:20:24.518
Thank you.

1:20:24.520 --> 1:20:25.820
If I'm honest,

1:20:25.822 --> 1:20:27.555
I feel a little bit
guilty about it.

1:20:27.557 --> 1:20:29.390
Why?

1:20:31.660 --> 1:20:32.960
I think
there's a part of me

1:20:32.962 --> 1:20:34.862
That volunteered
for selfish reasons.

1:20:37.199 --> 1:20:39.166
It's hard
to explain.

1:20:39.168 --> 1:20:40.801
No, I think
I understand.

1:20:40.803 --> 1:20:42.803
From the time we're young,

1:20:42.805 --> 1:20:45.639
People assume we're not
capable of certain things.

1:20:45.641 --> 1:20:48.275
Sometimes, we just need
to prove them wrong.

1:20:49.811 --> 1:20:51.879
[â™ª]

1:20:55.016 --> 1:20:56.717
I think, sometimes,

1:20:56.719 --> 1:20:59.086
I spend so much time
focused on my future...

1:21:00.255 --> 1:21:02.990
I lose sight of the most
important things...

1:21:02.992 --> 1:21:04.925
Right in front of me.

1:21:06.228 --> 1:21:08.429
[â™ª]

1:21:15.170 --> 1:21:18.305
And finally, let me say,
as a new school term begins,

1:21:18.307 --> 1:21:20.407
I want to remind
every one of you

1:21:20.409 --> 1:21:24.011
To keep your eyes on your books
and not out the window.

1:21:24.013 --> 1:21:25.813
[light chuckling]

1:21:25.815 --> 1:21:27.915
This may be god's house
on Sunday,

1:21:27.917 --> 1:21:29.884
But it's miss thatcher's house
during the week.

1:21:29.886 --> 1:21:32.820
And I've heard that no one
messes with miss thatcher.

1:21:32.822 --> 1:21:34.555
[children giggling]

1:21:34.557 --> 1:21:36.624
So be good...

1:21:36.626 --> 1:21:38.559
And welcome back.

1:21:42.664 --> 1:21:45.165
Lovely tribute,
pastor.

1:21:45.167 --> 1:21:48.702
Maybe not my finest work,
but thanks, abigail.

1:21:48.704 --> 1:21:49.803
Welcome back to you.

1:21:49.805 --> 1:21:51.038
Thank you.

1:21:51.040 --> 1:21:52.573
I was glad to hear
that things worked out

1:21:52.575 --> 1:21:54.074
With your daughter-in-law.

1:21:54.076 --> 1:21:56.877
Yes, it's been such a comfort
having her here with me.

1:21:58.213 --> 1:22:00.547
Well, I'd better
get back to the cafe.

1:22:00.549 --> 1:22:02.149
I have a lot of work
to catch up on.

1:22:02.151 --> 1:22:04.518
I understand
you put out excellent food.

1:22:04.520 --> 1:22:06.086
I'll have to come by
and try some.

1:22:06.088 --> 1:22:08.155
Please do.

1:22:09.491 --> 1:22:11.425
Morning, pastor.

1:22:15.964 --> 1:22:17.064
Hello.

1:22:17.066 --> 1:22:19.366
Here to enjoy
the fruits of your labor?

1:22:19.368 --> 1:22:21.001
Actually,
I brought you a gift.

1:22:21.003 --> 1:22:22.870
You're so sweet.

1:22:22.872 --> 1:22:24.705
Hi, miss thatcher!

1:22:24.707 --> 1:22:27.741
Nellie, patrick!
So good to see you both.

1:22:27.743 --> 1:22:29.910
Everything back to normal
on the homestead?

1:22:29.912 --> 1:22:32.379
Yup. But we changed
gertrude's name.

1:22:32.381 --> 1:22:34.148
Your cow?

1:22:34.150 --> 1:22:36.350
We're calling her
"lizzy" now.

1:22:36.352 --> 1:22:37.818
"lizzy"?

1:22:37.820 --> 1:22:40.854
We thought since she was
the first cow you ever milked,

1:22:40.856 --> 1:22:43.590
We should name her after you.

1:22:44.793 --> 1:22:46.360
[stifles his laugh]

1:22:46.362 --> 1:22:47.861
Come on, patrick!

1:22:47.863 --> 1:22:49.897
"lizzy." it's got
a nice ring to it.

1:22:49.899 --> 1:22:50.898
Hmm!

1:22:50.900 --> 1:22:52.900
[laughs] open your gift.

1:22:52.902 --> 1:22:54.702
Now, I ordered you
a teacher's bell,

1:22:54.704 --> 1:22:56.804
But it hasn't arrived yet,

1:22:56.806 --> 1:22:58.872
So I thought this would do
in the meantime.

1:23:00.575 --> 1:23:02.209
[bell clangs]

1:23:02.211 --> 1:23:04.244
A cow bell?

1:23:04.246 --> 1:23:05.646
Yeah.

1:23:05.648 --> 1:23:08.082
To honor your accomplishments
on the homestead.

1:23:10.018 --> 1:23:12.753
Well, miss thatcher,
school's about to start.

1:23:12.755 --> 1:23:14.088
Shouldn't you...

1:23:17.225 --> 1:23:19.059
[clanging]

1:23:22.030 --> 1:23:24.031
Welcome back!

1:23:24.033 --> 1:23:26.033
Good morning,
miss thatcher!

1:23:26.035 --> 1:23:27.835
Good morning, miss thatcher!

1:23:27.837 --> 1:23:30.637
[elizabeth chuckles and sighs]

1:23:30.639 --> 1:23:32.473
[â™ª]
