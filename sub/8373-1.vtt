03:41.040 --> 03:43.315
Come on, come on.

05:34.080 --> 05:36.275
- Where have you been?
- Delayed.

05:36.320 --> 05:39.835
That I figured.
This is a big deal for me.

05:39.880 --> 05:43.555
Hendricks had the keys to the Jeep.
I couldn't find the spares.

05:43.600 --> 05:46.319
Listen, act as if you've been here
the whole time.

05:46.360 --> 05:48.794
- How?
- Look bored.

05:50.200 --> 05:54.273
Thank you Amity High School Band
for that eloquent selection.

05:54.320 --> 05:55.912
We're happy, once again...

05:55.960 --> 05:57.951
Mama, Michael won't talk to me.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.629
- What are you doing here?
- Mrs Silvera couldn't come.

06:03.960 --> 06:08.556
And now this year's Miss Amity,
Tina Wilcox,

06:08.600 --> 06:14.755
will cut the ribbon, officially
opening this luxurious new hotel.

06:22.600 --> 06:26.912
This money tree is donated
by Len Peterson,

06:26.960 --> 06:29.793
the builder
of Amity Shores Condominiums,

06:29.840 --> 06:31.831
as a gesture of goodwill.

06:31.880 --> 06:33.871
Let's hear it for Len.

06:37.240 --> 06:38.639
Thanks, Len.

06:38.680 --> 06:44.710
$1,500 as a special gift
to the Amity Scholarship Fund.

06:49.520 --> 06:51.511
Go ahead, Tina, cut it.

06:54.680 --> 06:56.557
Atta girl.

07:08.960 --> 07:12.555
And now the Amity High School Band
once again.

07:12.600 --> 07:15.034
Refreshments on the patio, everyone.

07:15.480 --> 07:18.472
Oh, boy. Let's go.

07:29.840 --> 07:31.512
Brody, how are you?

07:31.560 --> 07:33.118
Hello, Martin.

07:33.160 --> 07:36.118
- I think it went well.
- Hell of a speech, Larry.

07:36.160 --> 07:37.798
Right on the money.

07:37.840 --> 07:41.037
Thank you. Have you met my son Larry?

07:41.080 --> 07:44.993
- No.
- Larry Jr. Larry, over here.

07:45.040 --> 07:47.235
Here we go. Say hello to Len.

07:47.280 --> 07:49.157
- How you doing?
- Hi, Larry.

07:49.200 --> 07:52.078
- Nice-looking boy.
- Thank you.

07:52.120 --> 07:57.831
Ellen, make sure that the bar is open
and everyone's taken care of.

07:57.880 --> 07:59.438
Sure.

08:01.520 --> 08:04.557
Yes, sir, a fantastic lady.

08:04.600 --> 08:08.957
- Don't know what I'd do without her.
- Really? Neither do I.

08:10.920 --> 08:14.595
- How old is your cousin?
- 17. She's a senior.

08:16.320 --> 08:18.356
I'm not crazy about blind dates.

08:18.400 --> 08:21.836
They're OK if they got
little white canes and tin cups.

08:21.880 --> 08:25.077
- That's awful!
- Ah, what the hell?

08:26.080 --> 08:29.675
- Did your mom put all this together?
- Yeah, it's her job.

08:29.720 --> 08:32.359
- Did she make the punch?
- No.

08:32.400 --> 08:34.515
Good, it's terrible.

09:03.280 --> 09:05.316
- Get your dance?
- Nope.

09:06.240 --> 09:09.789
- Me neither.
- Who you gonna ask next?

09:09.840 --> 09:13.719
Tina Wilcox. Ed's girlfriend.

09:13.760 --> 09:15.751
You're crazy.

09:15.800 --> 09:20.590
It doesn't hurt to ask. Sometimes
beautiful girls are the loneliest.

09:20.640 --> 09:22.631
That's a crock of shit.

09:22.680 --> 09:24.477
I know.

09:29.760 --> 09:33.230
Was it the fourth or fifth night
at the Jersey shore?

09:34.280 --> 09:36.077
The fourth!

09:36.120 --> 09:39.590
- I thought you wouldn't respect me.
- I did! I did!

09:43.960 --> 09:45.871
Why don't we get out of here?

09:45.920 --> 09:47.990
What? To fool around?

09:50.440 --> 09:53.432
- Why not?
- You're on.

11:10.800 --> 11:13.872
This pipe has more barnacles
than you do.

11:13.920 --> 11:16.514
What are you doing? I told you!

11:16.560 --> 11:19.791
Brush it off to your left!
Your other left.

11:19.840 --> 11:22.308
I thought you were off duty.

11:22.360 --> 11:26.114
Good morning! Till noon -
I'm on my own time.

11:26.160 --> 11:29.277
- Hey, Chief!
- Yeah?

11:29.320 --> 11:33.916
We got a gold plater
in the main channel, a big cruiser.

11:33.960 --> 11:37.111
- Whereabouts?
- Off the point.

11:37.160 --> 11:40.311
No running lights,
just the diver's flag.

11:40.360 --> 11:44.717
- Want me to run out there?
- Would you? I can't run this thing!

11:44.760 --> 11:47.752
- Happy to do it.
- I'll see you back at the office.

11:47.800 --> 11:49.677
Take the old man of the sea.

11:49.720 --> 11:54.191
Cast off the bowline,
and then the stern line,

11:54.240 --> 11:56.959
and then cast off the spring line.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.274
Let's go!

11:58.320 --> 12:00.880
We'll only be here for a few minutes.

12:00.920 --> 12:03.195
- Can't I come with you?
- No.

12:03.240 --> 12:06.357
- He can come with me.
- No.

12:06.400 --> 12:09.039
- No?
- No. Off the boat.

12:09.080 --> 12:10.752
He can help me, at least.

12:11.720 --> 12:13.472
Boo! Big brothers!

12:14.320 --> 12:17.630
Hey, Sean,
ever been an anchor before?

12:21.640 --> 12:24.359
- Mike, hi.
- You going out now?

12:24.400 --> 12:26.675
- No.
- Good, you can meet my cousin.

12:26.720 --> 12:28.631
Don't worry, I'll meet her.

12:28.680 --> 12:31.353
OK, Tom, see you later.
Same time Thursday.

12:33.080 --> 12:34.832
Andy, over here.

12:36.160 --> 12:37.559
See you guys later.

12:37.600 --> 12:40.353
- What's the problem?
- What isn't?!

12:40.400 --> 12:41.913
Brooke!

12:41.960 --> 12:44.030
Brooke!

12:44.080 --> 12:46.230
Jackie, hi.

12:46.280 --> 12:47.952
Quick, quick, who's that?

12:48.000 --> 12:50.594
- I'm in love!
- The cousin, I hope.

12:51.640 --> 12:54.552
Lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky...

12:58.760 --> 13:01.069
Did you see the way
she looked at you?

13:01.120 --> 13:04.112
- She wants you.
- She wasn't looking at me.

13:04.160 --> 13:07.277
What? She was staring at you
and drooling.

13:07.320 --> 13:10.312
No, I'm thin, I wear glasses,

13:10.360 --> 13:12.669
I live in Amity Island year-round.

13:12.720 --> 13:14.631
I'm not good enough for her.

13:17.120 --> 13:20.510
You're right,
she probably wasn't looking at you.

13:20.560 --> 13:23.791
Larry, look. Larry, look!

13:23.840 --> 13:25.558
- What?
- Look at her.

13:25.600 --> 13:27.079
Good to see you!

13:27.920 --> 13:31.469
- Well?
- She's got tits like a sparrow.

13:33.240 --> 13:35.231
Do you have to talk like that?

13:35.280 --> 13:38.033
What are you, my mother?
Undo the jib.

13:40.160 --> 13:42.310
- We're going sailing.
- Sailing?

13:42.360 --> 13:44.510
He's cute.

14:15.520 --> 14:17.511
Hey, look, I'm walking!

14:29.000 --> 14:31.195
Mike, over here.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.831
Douglas!

14:39.720 --> 14:44.635
I can't watch the news, a ball game,
can't even watch a movie.

14:44.680 --> 14:48.514
All I hear is that kid and his radio
going "breaker, breaker".

14:48.560 --> 14:51.597
I'll try but it's under
federal jurisdiction.

14:51.640 --> 14:52.959
Call the FBl.

14:54.600 --> 14:58.513
One at a time. You two talk to Polly,
you come with me.

15:01.520 --> 15:05.798
- What's this about Grace Kinny?
- Her bedroom window faces my son's.

15:05.840 --> 15:08.798
She's teasing him,
dancing around in a towel.

15:08.840 --> 15:12.196
Dancing? Hendricks, good.
Right this way. Excuse us.

15:12.240 --> 15:15.471
Come in here and check out this 908.

15:15.520 --> 15:18.318
What the hell's a 908?
I never heard of a 908.

15:18.360 --> 15:20.191
908 means get me out of there.

15:20.240 --> 15:24.153
- What's that?
- Diver's camera from the cruiser.

15:24.200 --> 15:26.191
Oh, the abandoned cruiser!

15:26.240 --> 15:28.595
Rich guys from Newport, Rhode Island.

15:28.640 --> 15:31.438
If I had a $100,000 boat,
I wouldn't abandon it.

15:31.480 --> 15:34.153
If you had one,
there'd be an investigation.

15:34.200 --> 15:38.239
- Very funny.
- It's driving my boy to distraction!

15:38.280 --> 15:40.555
- Dancing! Check out this dance.
- Dance?

16:02.600 --> 16:06.115
- Can I go back up?
- Take it back up.

16:10.040 --> 16:11.439
Now, back up, Mike!

16:16.400 --> 16:17.833
Mike, it's twisted.

16:34.120 --> 16:36.270
Pull it up, Mike.

16:48.520 --> 16:51.557
- Underneath you, Mike.
- Drop it down now.

16:59.600 --> 17:01.113
You OK?

17:09.200 --> 17:10.713
You OK?

17:22.599 --> 17:24.192
Pull down, Mike.

18:01.400 --> 18:04.597
'The weather continues
to be warm and clear.

18:04.640 --> 18:08.997
'Back to the 24-hour music from
Plymouth, the rock of New England. '

18:12.200 --> 18:14.509
Wait, take a break for a minute, OK?

18:14.560 --> 18:16.676
Tina... where are you going?

18:36.840 --> 18:37.989
Hey!

18:50.800 --> 18:52.791
Eddie, come on, let's go skiing.

18:52.840 --> 18:55.434
- What?
- We can use my uncle's boat.

18:55.480 --> 18:57.038
We'll do it next week, OK?

18:57.080 --> 18:59.435
With you everything is next week.

20:41.200 --> 20:42.758
Terry?

21:04.040 --> 21:05.473
Terry?

21:06.880 --> 21:08.632
Terry?

21:33.680 --> 21:34.999
No!

21:47.800 --> 21:48.949
Wow!

21:52.120 --> 21:53.439
God!

22:03.400 --> 22:07.632
I can't find anyone. They must have
gone to the bottom and drifted.

22:07.680 --> 22:12.435
Witnesses say there was one person
in the boat and one water-skiing.

22:12.480 --> 22:14.835
'I told you, there's nothing here. '

22:14.880 --> 22:16.916
I want you to try dragging.

22:16.960 --> 22:21.078
For how long? The current's moving
everything and it'll be dark soon.

22:21.120 --> 22:24.669
I don't care, I want you
to stay on it as long as it takes.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.399
10-4.

22:41.560 --> 22:45.439
We heard a noise like a boom.
Then there was this cloud of smoke.

22:45.480 --> 22:51.032
The explosion. One minute they were
having a wonderful time, the next...

22:52.200 --> 22:54.919
You've no idea
what could have caused it?

22:54.960 --> 22:57.428
I don't know
what could have done that.

23:01.560 --> 23:04.518
- Were they off-islanders?
- I don't know.

23:04.560 --> 23:06.676
Can we go now?

23:07.760 --> 23:09.512
Chief?

23:10.480 --> 23:13.552
Chief Brody, can we go, please?

23:13.600 --> 23:15.750
Yes, thank you, Tina.

23:38.520 --> 23:40.715
We've been over this a dozen times.

23:40.760 --> 23:42.239
I know, I know.

23:42.280 --> 23:45.158
- How much longer?
- Until we find something.

23:45.200 --> 23:47.350
I'm cold, bored.

23:47.400 --> 23:49.197
YOU'RE bored.

23:56.280 --> 23:57.633
Holy shit!

23:59.520 --> 24:00.839
George!

24:14.960 --> 24:16.951
Jesus, this is heavy!

24:44.920 --> 24:46.911
Aw, shit. Drop it.

24:46.960 --> 24:50.270
- What is it?
- Drop it. It's a power line.

24:50.320 --> 24:52.629
- Terrific
- Let me untangle it.

24:52.680 --> 24:55.035
We don't want a power blackout.

24:55.080 --> 24:57.514
Let's go before we do find something.

25:06.400 --> 25:08.595
That's your third smoke already.

25:08.640 --> 25:10.710
- With coffee.
- Try a donut.

25:11.680 --> 25:14.274
- I want Froot Loops.
- Eat Cheerios.

25:14.320 --> 25:16.470
You eat Cheerios, I want Froot Loops.

25:16.520 --> 25:18.750
You eat Cheerios.

25:18.800 --> 25:20.552
What are you guys up to today?

25:20.600 --> 25:23.876
- I'm going sailing.
- Again?

25:23.920 --> 25:27.754
- What else is there to do?
- What about that job?

25:28.760 --> 25:30.751
Do I have to?

25:30.800 --> 25:33.598
He doesn't have to.
It is his vacation.

25:33.640 --> 25:35.631
Where did I leave my date book?

25:37.880 --> 25:40.553
Good morning.
Everybody's up early today.

25:40.600 --> 25:42.670
Something going on?

25:42.720 --> 25:47.714
Lots. This kid is 17. We've talked
about him getting a job before.

25:47.760 --> 25:51.230
You're right. I wish you could
spend some time with him.

25:51.280 --> 25:53.396
How can I? I've got a boat accident.

25:53.440 --> 25:58.150
I've only got three cops and a deputy
in love with the police launch.

25:58.200 --> 26:02.193
And here's another one.
Everybody's a boat freak?

26:02.240 --> 26:04.037
It's an island.

26:05.000 --> 26:08.072
- I'm going.
- Hold it. Wait a minute.

26:11.200 --> 26:14.590
Don't go out too far if it's rough.
We've had a lot of trouble.

26:14.640 --> 26:16.756
- OK. See you later.
- Be careful.

26:16.800 --> 26:18.916
I'll be careful.

26:20.280 --> 26:22.396
- Tina, come back here.
- Nope!

26:24.200 --> 26:25.997
- Give me my hat.
- No!

26:27.320 --> 26:29.117
Come on, Tina!

26:31.120 --> 26:32.917
Come back here.

26:43.400 --> 26:45.630
I wonder why they decided to move.

26:45.680 --> 26:48.672
- Too hot in the lighthouse?
- Too hot for those two?!

27:02.360 --> 27:03.918
Yuck.

27:14.560 --> 27:18.519
I called you as soon as I heard.
I hear the bites are really big.

27:18.560 --> 27:21.120
- After we've looked, we'll talk.
- OK.

27:21.160 --> 27:22.639
Here it is.

27:22.680 --> 27:25.433
Could you move back, please?

27:25.480 --> 27:29.109
Move back.
Please just move back. Thanks.

27:33.520 --> 27:34.919
Jesus.

27:42.680 --> 27:44.671
What do you think?

27:44.720 --> 27:46.711
First things first.

27:46.760 --> 27:49.149
Tip of the snout, please.

28:01.760 --> 28:05.548
- OK. Seven and a half meters.
- Seven and a half meters?

28:05.600 --> 28:07.192
Correct.

28:14.720 --> 28:17.029
- Check the bite radius.
- The what?

28:17.080 --> 28:20.311
- The shape of the mouth.
- Whale's mouth?

28:20.360 --> 28:22.510
- Shark's mouth.
- What shark?

28:22.560 --> 28:24.596
The shark that did this.

28:24.640 --> 28:26.756
We don't know that, do we?

28:26.800 --> 28:29.997
- That's what we're here to find out.
- And we will.

28:30.040 --> 28:31.996
I can't hear you if you whisper.

28:32.040 --> 28:34.349
111 centimetres.

28:35.680 --> 28:36.829
68.

28:38.720 --> 28:41.109
I've had some experience with sharks.

28:41.160 --> 28:42.718
Oh, have you?

28:42.760 --> 28:46.389
Yeah. And I think a great white
might have done this.

28:46.440 --> 28:49.432
- Carcharodon carcharias?
- Right.

28:49.480 --> 28:53.029
What makes you think there
might be one in these waters?

28:53.080 --> 28:57.835
It's obvious a big fish
took a bite out of this big fish.

28:57.880 --> 29:00.348
This is a mammal, not a fish.

29:00.400 --> 29:03.312
Don't quibble!
Is it a shark bite or isn't it?

29:03.360 --> 29:04.679
Possibly.

29:04.720 --> 29:07.234
But this is a killer whale.

29:07.280 --> 29:10.477
It would have to be a shark
of considerable size.

29:13.680 --> 29:18.151
We know sharks are attracted
by blood and thrashing about.

29:18.200 --> 29:19.679
And sound.

29:19.720 --> 29:21.119
Sound?

29:21.160 --> 29:23.116
Sound, like sonar or radar.

29:23.160 --> 29:26.197
They hone in
on unusual, irregular sounds.

29:26.240 --> 29:28.879
Any rhythmic,
low-frequency vibration.

29:28.920 --> 29:30.831
So there could be one around?

29:30.880 --> 29:35.271
Not necessarily. These wounds could
have been inflicted out to sea.

29:35.320 --> 29:39.359
None were immediately fatal. The
currents could have carried it in.

29:39.400 --> 29:43.154
- We got a hell of a tide.
- Just take care of the crowd!

29:43.200 --> 29:44.189
Dad?

29:44.240 --> 29:46.754
Mr Hendricks, take this down, please.

29:49.160 --> 29:52.596
- No more sailing today, OK?
- We came out in my boat.

29:52.640 --> 29:54.915
- Andy'll take it back.
- I got a date.

29:54.960 --> 29:57.235
- She'll understand.
- She won't.

29:57.280 --> 29:59.316
Mike, give me a break, will you?

30:05.000 --> 30:08.629
It's either a great white
or another killer whale.

30:08.680 --> 30:10.591
I'd like to know which.

30:10.640 --> 30:13.154
It's impossible to tell
with that body.

30:13.200 --> 30:17.398
The animal's been ashore for 12 hours
and drifting for a day at least.

30:17.440 --> 30:20.159
Every nibbler
in the sea's taken a bite.

30:21.600 --> 30:25.275
I know dolphins communicate.
I mean, they send signals.

30:25.320 --> 30:29.518
If a shark was destroyed,
could another shark come and...

30:29.560 --> 30:32.597
Sharks don't take things personally,
Mr Brody.

30:37.120 --> 30:38.917
- Dad, can I...
- No.

30:41.680 --> 30:45.309
Don't worry, I'll take it back
and tie it up at the docks.

30:45.360 --> 30:47.715
- Bye, Mike.
- I'm sorry. Bye.

30:47.760 --> 30:51.878
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- I appreciate it. Thanks.

31:21.560 --> 31:23.790
Larry. Larry, wait a minute.

31:24.800 --> 31:29.590
I'm showing summer rentals, I think
we have a good season going for us.

31:29.640 --> 31:32.029
Swell. But I have to talk
to you alone.

31:32.080 --> 31:33.513
We're alone.

31:35.280 --> 31:37.669
We may have another shark problem.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.639
- Are you serious?
- You bet I'm serious.

31:43.640 --> 31:47.997
I've got a half-eaten whale on
the beach, got two persons missing.

31:48.040 --> 31:50.508
The whale's got
a bite out of it this big.

31:50.560 --> 31:53.074
No one has seen a shark.
Be realistic.

31:53.120 --> 31:57.511
The selectmen should know about it.
It's just a feeling, but...

31:59.520 --> 32:02.751
Larry, I not only have this attack
but I've got...

32:02.800 --> 32:07.032
- I've got two water-skiers...
- A tragedy, but a boating accident.

32:07.080 --> 32:09.719
No fin, no sharks.
A boating accident.

32:09.760 --> 32:13.355
- They're both still missing.
- We have a lot of deaths

32:13.400 --> 32:15.311
that never turn up.

32:16.120 --> 32:18.190
Are they all shark victims?

32:19.240 --> 32:21.356
Maybe they are.

32:21.400 --> 32:23.356
- Bullshit.
- Bullshit?

32:23.400 --> 32:26.915
Is it bullshit I got a whale
with a bite in it this big?

32:26.960 --> 32:28.632
What am I? An ass?

32:28.680 --> 32:32.832
When you called me,
I called Elkins and her bosses.

32:33.840 --> 32:36.513
Nothing she saw is proof of anything.

32:39.600 --> 32:41.670
So we're not going to do anything?

32:42.800 --> 32:45.553
Martin, don't press it this time.

32:48.120 --> 32:50.429
Well, I've got to get back to work.

32:53.480 --> 32:57.519
OK, Larry, but you just remember
this conversation.

32:57.560 --> 32:59.152
You just remember it!

36:16.080 --> 36:17.069
Chief?

36:22.320 --> 36:23.355
Yeah.

36:23.400 --> 36:25.231
Chief?

36:25.280 --> 36:27.840
Hi. Missed you at the funeral home.

36:27.880 --> 36:30.075
Santos said you'd be here.

36:31.120 --> 36:33.190
Yeah. Christ, what a mess.

36:34.120 --> 36:35.553
You didn't miss much.

36:35.600 --> 36:37.158
Positive ID?

36:37.200 --> 36:40.431
We're pretty sure
it was the woman aboard the boat.

36:56.040 --> 36:57.075
Yeah?

36:59.080 --> 37:01.594
Thank you, operator.
Just keep trying.

37:07.920 --> 37:11.071
- Anything new on those two divers?
- Nothing.

37:11.120 --> 37:14.829
- We should keep sightseers...
- Did you look at that stuff?

37:14.880 --> 37:16.916
- No.
- How about that camera?

37:19.120 --> 37:21.839
- Might be something in it.
- Yeah, right.

37:21.880 --> 37:25.429
- Take it to get developed.
- First thing in the morning.

37:25.480 --> 37:28.790
- Why not now?
- It's too late.

37:28.840 --> 37:31.115
Christ, I'm late for dinner.

37:31.160 --> 37:35.790
I'm expecting a long distance call.
Send it to the house.

37:35.840 --> 37:37.831
OK, Chief.

37:40.600 --> 37:43.034
Yes, I can hear you.

37:43.080 --> 37:46.675
Yes, I'll give him the message.
Thank you.

37:46.720 --> 37:48.119
That for me?

37:48.160 --> 37:50.310
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, gang.

37:50.360 --> 37:52.635
Well, sort of. Matt Hooper.

37:52.680 --> 37:58.710
He's on a vessel in the Antarctic and
won't be in radio range till spring.

37:58.760 --> 38:01.035
Yeah. I gave him a call.

38:16.560 --> 38:18.118
Martin?

38:19.320 --> 38:20.355
Martin?

38:21.680 --> 38:22.749
Yeah?

38:24.240 --> 38:26.595
You're a mess. Where were you?

38:26.640 --> 38:30.349
Over at Santos', I dragged a body
out of the ocean today.

38:32.480 --> 38:34.516
Have you any idea what happened?

38:34.560 --> 38:36.471
No, we don't know.

38:36.520 --> 38:40.877
Santos thinks it might be a victim
from the boat accident.

38:40.920 --> 38:42.638
Do you wanna talk about it?

38:45.840 --> 38:47.876
Just routine.

38:51.920 --> 38:53.194
OK.

38:54.400 --> 38:56.356
Hey, Mike, come here a minute.

38:56.400 --> 38:57.833
What is it?

38:57.880 --> 39:01.509
- Something for you to do tomorrow.
- I kinda had plans.

39:01.560 --> 39:05.519
Sailing? Forget it.
You're grounded. Beach, that's it.

39:05.560 --> 39:07.676
- Come on, Dad.
- I talked to John.

39:07.720 --> 39:10.075
He's got a job
till you go back to school.

39:10.120 --> 39:11.439
That's all summer.

39:11.480 --> 39:15.917
He wanted a job, now he's got one.
And I want that boat out the water.

39:15.960 --> 39:19.396
- Dad, can I...?
- Tomorrow night. And I mean it.

40:49.320 --> 40:52.153
Now... Everybody here?

40:52.200 --> 40:54.430
- Just about.
- OK, terrific.

40:55.640 --> 40:57.631
Folks, this is the town beach.

40:57.680 --> 41:00.911
The development, naturally,
has its own private access,

41:00.960 --> 41:03.838
but I wanted you to see
the concession area.

41:03.880 --> 41:07.077
Take a look at the sand.
It's like sugar.

41:07.120 --> 41:08.838
It's beautiful.

41:08.880 --> 41:14.716
In the summertime, at sunset,
the whole beach looks incredible.

41:14.760 --> 41:17.593
It can be absolutely breathtaking.

41:17.640 --> 41:22.475
You'll find this little bandstand
interesting. We take pride in this...

41:23.600 --> 41:25.955
Hello. Selling more of the good life?

41:26.000 --> 41:29.879
- Yeah. Piece of this, piece of that.
- Your husband's here.

41:29.920 --> 41:32.593
- What's he doing?
- His job.

41:41.640 --> 41:44.108
- Dad got you working, huh?
- Yeah.

41:44.160 --> 41:46.674
- I'm helping.
- Good.

41:46.720 --> 41:49.280
Do you happen to know
where your dad is?

41:49.320 --> 41:50.753
He's up there.

41:54.320 --> 41:56.151
For Christ's sake.

42:00.360 --> 42:05.718
If you have any questions
about recreational possibilities,

42:05.760 --> 42:09.036
Ellen Brody will be happy
to answer them.

42:09.080 --> 42:11.674
- Can I speak to you?
- Excuse me a moment.

42:12.680 --> 42:14.716
Larry, we've got some live ones.

42:15.800 --> 42:18.109
Brody's riding his tower.

42:19.480 --> 42:21.516
Oh, shit.

42:23.920 --> 42:25.592
You got it, sweetheart.

42:25.640 --> 42:27.073
Come on!

42:29.040 --> 42:31.679
- This fast enough for you?
- No, faster.

42:31.720 --> 42:33.551
- Faster?
- Faster!

42:37.120 --> 42:39.236
Hey, look! There's my dad.

42:40.280 --> 42:42.589
Wave to my son.

42:44.400 --> 42:45.753
Good.

42:45.800 --> 42:47.916
How do we get him
down from there?

42:47.960 --> 42:50.758
Well, maybe nobody noticed.

42:50.800 --> 42:53.268
Let's get them back in the van, huh?

42:53.320 --> 42:54.673
Yeah, come on.

42:56.200 --> 42:58.475
What's that man doing way up there?

42:58.520 --> 42:59.839
What man?

42:59.880 --> 43:02.474
Oh, he's watching.
You know, a lookout.

43:02.520 --> 43:03.919
For what?

43:03.960 --> 43:08.988
It's a shark tower. I saw one
in Florida. He's looking for sharks.

43:09.040 --> 43:12.919
Excuse me, dear,
it's an observation platform.

43:12.960 --> 43:16.236
That's our chief of police.
He's just checking it.

43:16.280 --> 43:21.957
Normally, it's used for...
birdwatching, weather... measurements

43:22.000 --> 43:24.878
and nature observation,
that sort of thing.

43:24.920 --> 43:27.957
Excuse me.
Ellen, we're running a little late.

43:28.000 --> 43:29.228
Ellen?

43:29.280 --> 43:34.229
If we all get on the bus,
we could show you the country club...

44:32.520 --> 44:36.354
Out of the water!
Out of the water, now! Everybody out!

44:36.400 --> 44:38.231
Get out! Get out of there!

44:38.280 --> 44:40.077
Get out!

44:40.120 --> 44:42.509
What the hell is that idiot doing?

44:42.560 --> 44:44.278
Everybody out!

44:49.560 --> 44:51.790
Get out of there! Get out!

44:53.080 --> 44:54.832
Everyone out!

44:56.120 --> 44:59.157
Out of the water! Get out of there!
Get out!

45:05.880 --> 45:09.236
Get out! Get out!

45:29.880 --> 45:31.552
It's just bluefish!

45:31.600 --> 45:35.036
Bluefish!
Chief, it's a school of bluefish!

45:36.960 --> 45:38.916
It's just bluefish.

45:53.040 --> 45:55.554
- Martin?
- Ellen, it's all right.

46:01.160 --> 46:03.230
Let's not make it worse, come on.

46:03.280 --> 46:06.875
OK, it's all over.
Let's get back to the club.

46:06.920 --> 46:08.990
It's OK.

46:09.040 --> 46:12.476
It's just... It's a false alarm.

46:13.440 --> 46:15.158
It's all right, go back.

46:24.880 --> 46:26.677
My God.

46:28.760 --> 46:30.751
Come on, let's go. It's all over.

48:07.480 --> 48:09.789
Polly, no calls now, huh?

48:11.520 --> 48:13.158
Fogarty?

48:14.680 --> 48:16.398
OK, put him on.

48:17.720 --> 48:19.199
Yeah, Phil?

48:22.160 --> 48:23.718
What pictures?

48:26.560 --> 48:28.755
You're kidding! I'll be right over.

48:32.040 --> 48:35.919
Yeah... it's the Orca.

48:35.960 --> 48:38.554
Good lens, too. Fast. 1-4, I think.

48:38.600 --> 48:41.717
- Notice the fusion...
- What else have you got?

48:41.760 --> 48:46.311
Over here. I exposed some more this
morning, I haven't developed 'em yet.

50:04.680 --> 50:06.830
That's it. That's the one.

50:16.120 --> 50:17.758
Speak of the devil.

50:19.720 --> 50:21.995
Martin, this is an official meeting.

50:22.040 --> 50:24.873
Good, I'm glad you're all here.
Look at this.

50:24.920 --> 50:29.152
Fogarty just developed it.
It's from the missing divers' camera.

50:32.920 --> 50:34.239
Seaweed?

50:36.240 --> 50:38.037
I don't know. What is it?

50:38.080 --> 50:41.197
It's underwater.
That's why it's so dark.

50:41.240 --> 50:43.276
There's nothing I can see.

50:43.320 --> 50:47.199
What are you talking about?
Look at this. That's a shark.

50:47.240 --> 50:50.391
Look at the outline,
the mouth, the eyes.

50:50.440 --> 50:54.035
Is that what it is?
Sorry, I just don't see it.

50:54.080 --> 50:55.433
Neither do I.

50:58.400 --> 51:00.277
Martin, it could be anything.

51:00.320 --> 51:03.392
Are you telling me
I don't know what a shark looks like?

51:03.440 --> 51:06.193
This is nothing.
Something in the lens.

51:06.240 --> 51:08.629
- Lens my ass.
- Damn right it's your ass.

51:08.680 --> 51:09.954
Be reasonable.

51:10.000 --> 51:11.956
Reasonable! With him?

51:12.000 --> 51:14.560
Goddamn it,
will you just listen to him?

51:14.600 --> 51:17.160
Be reasonable?! Look, Brody,

51:17.200 --> 51:19.350
you started a panic on that beach.

51:19.400 --> 51:22.597
You shot up the place.
God knows who you injured.

51:22.640 --> 51:26.030
What if somebody sues us?
Did you think about that?

51:26.080 --> 51:27.513
It could ruin us.

51:27.560 --> 51:29.596
Don't worry about being sued.

51:29.640 --> 51:33.076
If this is what I think it is,
there won't be anybody here.

51:33.120 --> 51:36.317
- Now, let's not...
- Let's not what, Larry?

51:36.360 --> 51:39.113
Larry, let's forget it.
He won't listen.

51:39.160 --> 51:42.311
- It's obvious he's made up his mind.
- You bet I have.

51:42.360 --> 51:45.636
I'm telling you
and everybody here, that's a shark.

51:45.680 --> 51:48.399
And I know
because I've seen one up close.

51:48.440 --> 51:52.831
And you better do something because
I won't go through that hell again.

51:58.800 --> 52:02.509
Martin, could you wait
here for a minute?

52:02.560 --> 52:04.357
For what?

52:04.400 --> 52:06.470
Please, just have a seat,

52:06.520 --> 52:10.229
while we look at the picture
and make up our own minds.

52:15.440 --> 52:18.318
All right. I'll have a seat.

52:20.160 --> 52:21.752
For what it's worth.

52:21.800 --> 52:23.472
Thank you.

52:24.480 --> 52:26.550
Gentlemen, please.

52:53.280 --> 52:54.998
Yeah!

53:19.880 --> 53:21.950
Hey, Mike.

53:22.000 --> 53:23.956
I saw your dad over at Town Hall.

53:24.000 --> 53:25.479
I know.

53:25.520 --> 53:28.239
Did he really freak out
on the town beach?

53:28.280 --> 53:30.032
I don't know.

53:30.080 --> 53:32.674
Don't worry about them.
It's all bullshit.

53:32.720 --> 53:36.679
Hey, you know this is the only place
where the garbage man delivers?

53:36.720 --> 53:40.315
Ha ha ha

53:40.360 --> 53:43.193
- Anyone wanna go to the lighthouse?
- Now?

53:43.240 --> 53:45.151
Tomorrow. Maybe spend the day.

53:45.200 --> 53:47.873
My dad left some cases of beer
in the garage.

53:47.920 --> 53:52.038
- Is it still there?
- It's kinda vacationing on my boat!

53:53.080 --> 53:55.310
Mike, are you going to go?

53:55.360 --> 53:58.591
- Yeah, why not?
- You might be painting toilets!

53:58.640 --> 54:00.471
Very funny

54:00.520 --> 54:04.308
- Are we going to have a picnic?
- Yeah, you bring the food.

54:13.520 --> 54:15.397
- Mike?
- Hi.

54:15.440 --> 54:18.079
I'd like to go to the lighthouse
with you.

54:18.120 --> 54:19.712
I'm not sure I can go.

54:21.040 --> 54:24.316
I'm grounded.
Dad won't let me use my boat.

54:24.360 --> 54:27.432
Do you always do what
your parents tell you to?

54:29.680 --> 54:32.558
- No.
- Good. I'll be at the dock at eight.

54:33.720 --> 54:35.836
Eight o'clock, everybody.

55:12.600 --> 55:15.114
I don't know what I'd do.

55:17.320 --> 55:21.029
Hey! What is this?
A wake for a funeral?

55:21.080 --> 55:24.197
- You surprised us.
- I came as soon as I heard.

55:26.640 --> 55:29.234
They only fired me,
they didn't bury me.

55:30.200 --> 55:32.760
- Hello, baby, I'm home.
- I know.

55:32.800 --> 55:35.268
I know you know.

55:37.520 --> 55:39.875
Listen, I've got something for you.

55:41.200 --> 55:46.149
This will look better on you than me
because you're a snappier dresser.

55:47.120 --> 55:49.873
Oh, hey!
You're drinking the good stuff.

55:49.920 --> 55:53.390
How about a toast?
A toast to the new chief.

55:54.960 --> 55:58.555
Come on, the chief's going
to need all the luck he can get.

55:59.280 --> 56:02.272
No? OK, we'll do it together.

56:03.520 --> 56:05.556
A toast to the new chief.

56:08.880 --> 56:10.632
Hail to the chief.

56:19.600 --> 56:22.990
Come on, drink!
This is a milestone in your career.

56:23.040 --> 56:25.554
- Ease up, Martin.
- Look, Chief,

56:25.600 --> 56:27.591
not only don't I want your job,

56:27.640 --> 56:30.871
but I came to tell you
I think you're the greatest.

56:30.920 --> 56:34.276
- And I...
- Oh, Jeff, it's OK.

56:34.320 --> 56:37.392
Come on. It's not your fault,
I know that.

56:42.680 --> 56:45.114
Well, I got to go anyway.

56:48.160 --> 56:50.230
Thanks for coming by, Jeff.

56:50.280 --> 56:52.714
- You've been a big help.
- Thank you.

56:52.760 --> 56:54.876
- Good night, Jeff.
- Good night.

56:56.240 --> 57:00.233
Poor Hendricks.
They'll fire his ass, too.

57:01.560 --> 57:03.516
You'll see.

57:04.760 --> 57:07.479
I showed them a picture
of that shark.

57:07.520 --> 57:09.112
They didn't see it.

57:10.080 --> 57:12.355
They see only what they want to see.

57:14.080 --> 57:16.389
But it's out there, all right.

57:16.440 --> 57:20.353
- It's a big mother, too.
- Is that why they fired you?

57:21.560 --> 57:23.391
It wasn't just that.

57:23.440 --> 57:26.591
What was it? The beach?
I saw what happened.

57:26.640 --> 57:28.995
Oh, I blew it. I blew it.

57:29.040 --> 57:32.316
I shot off my mouth.
I shot off my gun.

57:34.880 --> 57:36.871
Four years down the drain.

57:38.040 --> 57:39.758
Shot to hell.

57:43.240 --> 57:45.708
What a dummy.

57:47.120 --> 57:48.599
What else?

57:50.320 --> 57:51.753
What else?

58:01.520 --> 58:03.431
I've never been fired before.

58:04.600 --> 58:06.716
You know that?

58:06.760 --> 58:10.878
I mean, once when I was 17,
when I was a kid, yeah.

58:10.920 --> 58:13.639
But... never from a real job.

58:15.760 --> 58:18.274
Nobody ever told me
I couldn't hack it.

58:18.320 --> 58:20.834
They're not saying that.

58:21.760 --> 58:23.352
Yes, they are.

58:24.320 --> 58:26.038
They are.

58:28.720 --> 58:31.871
Maybe they're right.

58:31.920 --> 58:33.717
I'm tired.

58:33.760 --> 58:35.398
Tired.

58:41.720 --> 58:43.995
I'm too damn tired.

58:50.520 --> 58:52.317
Too damn drunk.

58:53.280 --> 58:56.158
That's what you are, too damn drunk.

59:45.480 --> 59:47.391
- Are you going out?
- Yeah.

59:47.840 --> 59:49.637
Going sailing?

59:50.920 --> 59:52.717
- Maybe.
- Take me.

59:52.760 --> 59:53.749
No!

59:53.800 --> 59:56.712
- I wanna go with you.
- Shh! Quiet!

59:57.800 --> 59:59.233
Michael.

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:07.670
All right. Come on. But be quiet!

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:25.197
Hello, Denise, love of my life.

01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:28.312
If you're grounded,
what are we doing? Practice?

01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:29.713
Yeah, practice.

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:34.390
Why are we here and not the beach? We
can fool around, pick up some girls.

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:38.668
If you're gonna get in the way,
go home.

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:41.029
I'm not in the way.
Andy, am I in the way?

01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:42.877
You're always in the way.

01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:44.512
Is he causing trouble?

01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:46.630
Put me down!

01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:48.989
- You can go out in my boat.
- Yeah!

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:51.429
You want him? You can have him.

01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:54.358
I think you just made
somebody very happy.

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:56.038
- Hi guys.
- Hi.

01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:59.197
- Mike, you going out?
- I thought you were grounded.

01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:01.993
- I can go out if I want to.
- He can.

01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:04.759
Is there enough room
for all of us on the boat?

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:08.031
- I don't know, we're...
- There's plenty of room.

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:09.798
I guess so.

01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:13.070
Brooke? I've got room.

01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:15.395
Great!

01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:18.551
- You'll go with me?
- Sure.

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:21.717
Thanks guys,
but I'm going with Timmy. Come on.

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:23.830
Fantastic!

01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:27.189
- It's a big mistake.
- Don't worry.

01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:29.470
Come on, you guys, I'm ready.

01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:35.716
You said she was coming with us.

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:38.149
Well, obviously, she's not.

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:41.397
- You wanna talk about it?
- You wanna swim home?

01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:36.319
- Hey, Tom!
- Nicholas! You should be in class.

01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:38.157
I've got company!

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:42.311
- I'm going for lobster.
- Great! Bring me one!

01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:45.636
- I want mine with butter.
- Got that, Tom?

01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:48.756
So long, turkeys.

01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:51.155
Sparky will take you down today.

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:53.760
If you're ready,
let's buddy-up and drop.

01:05:40.134 --> 01:05:43.171
Get us in!
For Christ's sake, get us in.

01:05:43.214 --> 01:05:45.933
Let's get him in and keep him warm.

01:05:45.974 --> 01:05:47.805
Put him in the forward cabin.

01:05:49.654 --> 01:05:53.010
He'll be OK. Things'll be OK.

01:05:53.054 --> 01:05:55.090
Let's go.

01:07:27.134 --> 01:07:28.772
Thank you.

01:07:38.254 --> 01:07:39.926
So?

01:07:42.414 --> 01:07:45.645
So, I'll go down to the office,
clean out the desk,

01:07:45.694 --> 01:07:47.969
turn in the truck,

01:07:48.014 --> 01:07:51.450
and maybe get shitfaced
and rap your boss in the mouth.

01:07:51.494 --> 01:07:53.132
I better give notice.

01:07:53.174 --> 01:07:55.642
Take it easy. We may need the income.

01:07:58.174 --> 01:07:59.766
Mike's gone.

01:08:01.094 --> 01:08:04.643
He's making out early these days,
must be a morning man.

01:08:04.694 --> 01:08:06.252
Like his father.

01:08:10.974 --> 01:08:13.647
Good morning. Anything special today?

01:08:13.694 --> 01:08:17.767
No. Sean's out somewhere.
Let him have whatever he wants.

01:08:17.814 --> 01:08:20.725
- Just keep him away from the candy.
- OK.

01:08:20.774 --> 01:08:23.287
- Do I still get my ride?
- Mmm.

01:08:24.254 --> 01:08:28.327
Call your brother, the plumber,
that sink upstairs is screwed up.

01:08:28.374 --> 01:08:30.649
Frankie? He's my cousin.

01:08:30.694 --> 01:08:33.606
Ask if he can use an apprentice.

01:08:33.654 --> 01:08:35.406
Have a nice day.

01:09:03.334 --> 01:09:05.848
Do you want to just leave
her pointing up?

01:09:05.894 --> 01:09:07.566
I'm on it.

01:09:07.613 --> 01:09:11.493
There we go. Yeah, this is fine.

01:09:12.854 --> 01:09:14.446
What about sailing?

01:09:14.493 --> 01:09:16.131
What about it?

01:09:16.174 --> 01:09:18.483
Don't you worry. We're gonna make it.

01:09:18.533 --> 01:09:21.173
We'll make it to Budapest
if you're not careful!

01:09:21.214 --> 01:09:22.966
Hey, what about the others?

01:09:23.014 --> 01:09:25.209
What about them?

01:09:25.254 --> 01:09:27.448
They'll be there when we get there.

01:09:27.493 --> 01:09:30.292
They'll have their bonfire,
clams, liquor...

01:09:30.334 --> 01:09:31.562
Yeah?

01:09:31.613 --> 01:09:34.287
What are we gonna do in the meantime?

01:09:34.334 --> 01:09:38.292
Well, in the meantime,
we'll have to think of something.

01:09:45.334 --> 01:09:46.813
Wait a minute.

01:09:46.854 --> 01:09:48.207
What?

01:09:49.174 --> 01:09:50.845
Get out the blanket.

01:09:50.894 --> 01:09:54.967
I got black marks all over my butt
and mom's getting uptight about it.

01:09:55.014 --> 01:09:56.367
OK.

01:09:57.774 --> 01:09:59.446
Out with the blanket.

01:10:01.694 --> 01:10:03.366
You really need a blanket?

01:10:03.414 --> 01:10:05.211
I don't need one!

01:10:13.014 --> 01:10:16.086
Well... here's your blanket.

01:10:23.214 --> 01:10:25.330
Eddie! Help!

01:10:27.854 --> 01:10:29.003
Eddie!

01:10:29.054 --> 01:10:31.488
- Tina!
- Help me!

01:10:31.534 --> 01:10:33.126
Tina!

01:11:00.534 --> 01:11:02.570
Oh... Jesus.

01:11:02.614 --> 01:11:06.448
Eddie, swim!
Swim fast, it's a shark, Eddie.

01:11:06.494 --> 01:11:07.643
Swim!

01:11:11.574 --> 01:11:14.008
Oh, God. Eddie, swim!

01:11:14.054 --> 01:11:16.488
Swim faster! Hurry!

01:11:16.534 --> 01:11:19.332
Come on! Swim!

01:11:19.374 --> 01:11:22.844
Hurry, Eddie. It's a shark!

01:11:22.894 --> 01:11:26.603
Eddie, hurry! Faster! Come on. Swim!

01:11:26.654 --> 01:11:28.884
Hurry! Hurry, Eddie.

01:11:34.054 --> 01:11:35.169
Eddie!

01:11:53.694 --> 01:11:55.412
Tina...

01:12:06.414 --> 01:12:08.086
Oh, Mama...

01:12:11.294 --> 01:12:13.569
Please make it go away.

01:12:16.534 --> 01:12:18.172
Make it go away.

01:12:19.494 --> 01:12:21.450
Make it go away.

01:12:32.654 --> 01:12:34.690
Honey, it's not your job any more.

01:12:34.734 --> 01:12:36.531
I just wanna look.

01:12:46.894 --> 01:12:49.362
Come on, get out of there! Come on.

01:13:19.854 --> 01:13:23.893
- What happened to him?
- Embolism. Air bubbles in the blood.

01:13:23.934 --> 01:13:26.402
He came up too fast, Chief.

01:13:26.454 --> 01:13:28.285
Something must have scared him.

01:13:28.334 --> 01:13:30.052
He just panicked.

01:13:30.094 --> 01:13:32.847
Don't worry,
we're taking good care of him.

01:13:39.814 --> 01:13:41.486
How did this happen?

01:13:41.534 --> 01:13:44.048
Bite reflex, like a spasm.

01:13:44.094 --> 01:13:46.528
It happened after the kids went out.

01:13:46.574 --> 01:13:48.371
What kids?

01:13:48.414 --> 01:13:52.327
Junior Vaughan,
Brookie Peters, Jackie, Mike...

01:13:52.374 --> 01:13:53.966
Our Mike?

01:13:54.014 --> 01:13:56.448
They're headed
for the lighthouse. Hey!

01:14:08.054 --> 01:14:12.047
Look, Chief, you're not chief now.
I can't let you take her out.

01:14:12.094 --> 01:14:15.564
Mrs Brody, look, you can't go.
Neither one of you can go.

01:14:15.614 --> 01:14:17.809
- Get that line.
- Mike is out there.

01:14:17.854 --> 01:14:21.005
But I signed for the boat.
Mrs Brody, please.

01:14:21.054 --> 01:14:25.093
Shit! Chief, go on up to the bow,
you're doing that wrong.

01:14:25.134 --> 01:14:27.170
Go ahead, untie the bowline.

01:14:27.214 --> 01:14:29.489
They can't fire both of us, right?

01:14:29.534 --> 01:14:31.490
Somebody's got to be in charge.

01:14:31.534 --> 01:14:34.810
All right,
which direction do you wanna go?

01:14:34.854 --> 01:14:37.448
You said something
about a lighthouse.

01:14:37.494 --> 01:14:38.643
All right.

01:14:56.054 --> 01:14:58.648
Amity Launch to Harbour Patrol.

01:14:58.694 --> 01:15:00.332
'This is Harbour Patrol. '

01:15:00.374 --> 01:15:03.571
Listen, do you think
you can raise me a chopper?

01:15:03.614 --> 01:15:06.606
'Is that you Brody? Not right away.

01:15:06.654 --> 01:15:08.565
'It's out checking a buoy. '

01:15:08.614 --> 01:15:10.525
Get it out to the lighthouse.

01:15:10.574 --> 01:15:14.249
There's some kids sailing out there.
I want them back in port.

01:15:14.294 --> 01:15:17.650
'Affirmative.
Turn the kids back to port.

01:15:17.694 --> 01:15:19.764
'I heard you. Patrol out. '

01:15:19.814 --> 01:15:21.691
Brody out.

01:15:28.054 --> 01:15:30.522
Hurry up, suckers, you're dragging!

01:15:39.854 --> 01:15:44.644
Hey, let's go past the lighthouse.
I know a better spot. Come about.

01:15:44.694 --> 01:15:46.366
You got it!

01:17:18.174 --> 01:17:19.766
I got it, Chief.

01:17:44.694 --> 01:17:47.083
It's all right. Come on.

01:17:48.334 --> 01:17:49.813
It's OK.

01:17:51.294 --> 01:17:53.091
It's all right.

01:17:53.134 --> 01:17:54.283
No.

01:17:55.254 --> 01:17:56.972
No.

01:17:58.174 --> 01:17:59.368
Ellen.

01:18:01.134 --> 01:18:03.329
No, no.

01:18:06.894 --> 01:18:08.850
Tina, Tina...

01:18:08.894 --> 01:18:11.488
Tina, it's OK.

01:18:11.534 --> 01:18:13.525
- It's still there.
- What is?

01:18:13.574 --> 01:18:15.166
What's still there?

01:18:15.214 --> 01:18:17.853
Sh-sh-sh-sh...

01:18:17.894 --> 01:18:19.612
Shark!

01:18:21.014 --> 01:18:22.811
It's still there.

01:18:46.574 --> 01:18:49.850
That boat will take you in.
Where the hell are they?

01:18:49.894 --> 01:18:52.931
Ten degrees off your starboard.
Take a heading...

01:18:52.974 --> 01:18:54.453
Not that shit! Point!

01:18:54.494 --> 01:18:55.609
There.

01:18:55.654 --> 01:18:57.963
All right, I got it.

01:19:15.174 --> 01:19:18.405
Mr Christian! Mr Christian!

01:19:18.454 --> 01:19:22.447
Pump up this boat! And shave off
that dreadful moustache.

01:19:22.494 --> 01:19:26.931
England expects every man
to do his duty. Fire when ready!

01:19:27.014 --> 01:19:30.006
Damn the torpedoes!
Full speed ahead!

01:19:30.054 --> 01:19:33.205
This will be our finest hour.

01:19:35.494 --> 01:19:37.086
Oh, shit.

01:19:37.214 --> 01:19:39.887
Hey, Bligh, someone pop your balloon?

01:19:39.934 --> 01:19:42.368
No problem, no problem.

01:20:12.294 --> 01:20:14.046
Balance the boat!

01:20:28.254 --> 01:20:30.290
Watch out!

01:20:33.054 --> 01:20:34.726
Do something!

01:20:40.574 --> 01:20:42.007
Timmy! Brooke!

01:20:42.094 --> 01:20:43.652
Hey! Look out.

01:20:48.254 --> 01:20:50.006
Where is it?

01:20:50.054 --> 01:20:53.171
- Get me out of here!
- I'll get you out.

01:20:53.214 --> 01:20:54.363
Larry!

01:20:54.414 --> 01:20:56.689
Larry! Turn!

01:20:57.134 --> 01:20:58.965
Turn!

01:21:04.214 --> 01:21:05.966
It's OK.

01:21:09.014 --> 01:21:12.290
- Hurry up!
- Mike's out there.

01:21:12.334 --> 01:21:14.006
Out of the water.

01:21:18.214 --> 01:21:21.126
Somebody look out for Mike!

01:21:22.334 --> 01:21:23.733
Hang on to something!

01:21:23.774 --> 01:21:26.163
Mike, get out of there!

01:21:27.254 --> 01:21:29.085
Hold on!

01:21:33.014 --> 01:21:34.527
Oh, my God.

01:21:34.574 --> 01:21:36.326
Mike!

01:21:37.374 --> 01:21:39.365
Brody!

01:21:39.414 --> 01:21:40.688
That's it.

01:21:42.334 --> 01:21:45.087
- Get his arm.
- Come on.

01:21:47.094 --> 01:21:48.766
Pull his jacket!

01:21:52.094 --> 01:21:54.528
Get him clear, it's coming up.

01:21:58.734 --> 01:22:00.372
Come on! Come on!

01:22:08.254 --> 01:22:10.131
Shit!

01:22:38.614 --> 01:22:40.411
He's bleeding pretty bad.

01:22:43.054 --> 01:22:45.488
We got to get Mike to a doctor.

01:22:45.534 --> 01:22:47.172
Can you sail?

01:22:47.214 --> 01:22:49.330
Yeah. We'll take him in.

01:22:49.374 --> 01:22:51.012
OK. Get some help here fast.

01:22:51.054 --> 01:22:52.806
Let's go.

01:23:08.934 --> 01:23:11.050
Let's wrap this mess up.

01:23:12.294 --> 01:23:14.364
Throw this to Brooke.

01:23:15.334 --> 01:23:17.768
Brooke, get this
and throw it to Mark.

01:23:21.374 --> 01:23:23.012
Here, take it.

01:23:23.054 --> 01:23:25.966
Tie a bowline around your mast.

01:23:28.494 --> 01:23:29.973
Easy.

01:23:30.014 --> 01:23:31.686
Come on, pull.

01:23:31.734 --> 01:23:33.611
I don't know if it'll hold.

01:23:33.654 --> 01:23:35.770
All right. Someone put a fender up.

01:23:35.814 --> 01:23:38.044
We could use another hand on this.

01:23:38.094 --> 01:23:39.766
Take it easy. Just pull.

01:23:40.974 --> 01:23:42.646
Tie it off. All right.

01:24:14.894 --> 01:24:17.010
Amity Launch to Air Patrol One.

01:24:17.774 --> 01:24:19.969
Amity Launch to Air Patrol One.

01:24:20.014 --> 01:24:21.606
Do you read me?

01:24:21.654 --> 01:24:24.168
'This is Air Patrol.
That you, Brody?'

01:24:24.214 --> 01:24:27.126
Yeah. Do you have
a fix on those kids?

01:24:27.174 --> 01:24:28.926
'Negative. I'm still down. '

01:24:28.974 --> 01:24:32.284
Get the hell up
because I'm out here alone.

01:24:32.334 --> 01:24:34.484
'Brody, I got to switch frequencies.

01:24:34.534 --> 01:24:37.924
'Call my boss.
I'll meet you by Francis Shoal. Out. '

01:24:39.974 --> 01:24:42.932
Francis Shoal?
Where the hell is Francis Shoal?

01:24:56.054 --> 01:24:58.010
Shit.

01:24:58.054 --> 01:25:00.204
I'm all alone out here.

01:25:40.014 --> 01:25:41.891
Anyone want to play charades?

01:25:44.094 --> 01:25:45.083
No.

01:25:46.174 --> 01:25:49.246
All we have to do is land
at Cable Junction and wait.

01:25:49.294 --> 01:25:51.683
How will we do that on this garbage?

01:25:54.614 --> 01:25:56.764
What's after Cable Junction?

01:25:56.814 --> 01:25:59.806
The Atlantic. Then Ireland.

01:26:03.494 --> 01:26:05.769
God, I'm hungry.

01:26:34.734 --> 01:26:36.611
Air Patrol to Base.

01:26:36.654 --> 01:26:40.329
I have a positive location
on that sailing party.

01:26:40.374 --> 01:26:42.524
Disabled and adrift,

01:26:42.574 --> 01:26:46.044
about three quarters of a mile west
of Cable Junction,

01:26:46.094 --> 01:26:48.688
wind and tide carrying them due east.

01:27:35.014 --> 01:27:37.084
Is everyone OK? Is anybody hurt?

01:27:37.134 --> 01:27:38.203
No!

01:27:38.254 --> 01:27:40.529
I'll tow you to Cable Junction,

01:27:40.574 --> 01:27:43.168
then call the Coast Guard.

01:27:45.054 --> 01:27:46.965
Throw me a line.

01:27:47.014 --> 01:27:49.369
Take it easy. Here we go.

01:27:49.414 --> 01:27:51.882
- Oh, what a day
- Here you go!

01:28:01.334 --> 01:28:02.687
OK.

01:28:04.734 --> 01:28:07.248
- Now, hold on to something.
- OK.

01:28:07.294 --> 01:28:09.569
- Hurry up!
- Better hang on.

01:30:05.334 --> 01:30:06.847
Sean.

01:30:06.894 --> 01:30:09.613
- Sean!
- Sean!

01:30:11.214 --> 01:30:12.932
Sean!

01:30:13.894 --> 01:30:15.327
Sean!

01:30:16.494 --> 01:30:17.813
Get him in the boat.

01:30:19.334 --> 01:30:20.847
- Sean!
- Come on!

01:30:20.894 --> 01:30:22.213
Get aboard.

01:30:22.254 --> 01:30:24.165
- Hurry!
- Come on.

01:30:27.214 --> 01:30:28.852
Come on.

01:30:33.774 --> 01:30:35.651
I can't get up.

01:30:39.854 --> 01:30:41.412
No!

01:30:45.174 --> 01:30:46.163
No!

01:30:50.214 --> 01:30:53.286
Take her to the hospital
and meet me at the office.

01:30:57.174 --> 01:30:59.529
Try to understand my position...

01:30:59.574 --> 01:31:01.804
Tina will be all right. Are you OK?

01:31:03.294 --> 01:31:06.013
Ellen, I'm sorry.
Believe me, I'm sorry.

01:31:06.054 --> 01:31:07.726
I was only thinking of...

01:31:07.774 --> 01:31:09.924
I don't give a damn what you think.

01:31:09.974 --> 01:31:13.762
A boy is dead and my son and husband
are still out there.

01:31:59.054 --> 01:32:01.773
Amity Launch to Harbour Patrol.

01:32:08.254 --> 01:32:10.085
Amity Launch to Harbour...

01:32:11.654 --> 01:32:13.053
Damn it!

01:32:19.934 --> 01:32:22.323
Sean, catch the rope!

01:32:22.374 --> 01:32:25.366
- Come on, the rope!
- Sean!

01:32:25.414 --> 01:32:27.006
Sean, catch the rope!

01:32:27.054 --> 01:32:28.772
Sean, the rope!

01:32:28.814 --> 01:32:32.489
- Come on, Sean!
- Come on, Sean!

01:32:32.534 --> 01:32:34.013
Come on!

01:32:34.054 --> 01:32:35.123
Sean!

01:32:35.174 --> 01:32:37.085
Sean, catch the rope!

01:32:37.134 --> 01:32:38.692
The rope, Sean!

01:32:38.734 --> 01:32:40.372
Come on, Sean!

01:32:40.414 --> 01:32:43.053
Come on!
You've gotta help or it won't work.

01:32:43.094 --> 01:32:44.732
Will you stop?

01:32:44.774 --> 01:32:47.208
Come on, Sean, wake up!

01:32:47.774 --> 01:32:49.366
Pick it up!

01:32:51.054 --> 01:32:52.373
Sean!

01:32:53.334 --> 01:32:55.052
Sean, goddamn it.

01:32:55.094 --> 01:32:58.131
Sean, listen to me
or I'll break your ass!

01:33:02.334 --> 01:33:03.562
OK, come on.

01:33:05.014 --> 01:33:07.130
OK, Sean, now listen.

01:33:07.174 --> 01:33:10.371
We'll throw you this rope
and you better catch it.

01:33:10.414 --> 01:33:12.052
Sean, you ready?

01:33:12.094 --> 01:33:14.050
Here it comes, kid.

01:33:18.294 --> 01:33:20.012
Get it, Sean.

01:33:20.054 --> 01:33:22.204
Sean, get it.

01:33:22.254 --> 01:33:24.449
Come on, get it.

01:33:24.494 --> 01:33:27.930
Good. Now tie it around
the centreboard.

01:33:27.974 --> 01:33:29.771
Tie it tight.

01:33:32.254 --> 01:33:33.767
You ready? Hang on.

01:33:33.814 --> 01:33:35.088
Hold on.

01:33:35.134 --> 01:33:36.806
Hang on, OK?

01:33:36.854 --> 01:33:38.890
Here we go. Hold on tight.

01:33:49.054 --> 01:33:50.533
OK, kid.

01:33:52.094 --> 01:33:54.050
Take it easy.

01:33:56.174 --> 01:33:57.732
Come on.

01:33:57.774 --> 01:33:59.173
OK.

01:34:02.774 --> 01:34:05.242
- Get him out!
- Come on.

01:34:15.054 --> 01:34:17.204
Oh, God. Are you OK, kid?

01:34:17.254 --> 01:34:19.370
I thought we lost you.

01:34:26.414 --> 01:34:28.245
Cable Junction's ahead.

01:34:29.014 --> 01:34:31.289
- Can we make it?
- I don't know.

01:34:31.334 --> 01:34:33.643
- Hey, I was just asking!
- I know.

01:34:36.614 --> 01:34:38.206
How's she doing?

01:34:38.254 --> 01:34:40.165
Just got to keep her warm.

01:34:43.334 --> 01:34:45.768
Somebody help me
and we could steer this.

01:34:47.134 --> 01:34:49.443
What are you playing
with a tube for?

01:34:49.494 --> 01:34:51.405
- If everyone...
- Shut up!

01:34:51.454 --> 01:34:54.412
I'm sorry
but I can't stop thinking about this!

01:34:54.454 --> 01:34:55.967
Well, you better try!

01:34:56.014 --> 01:34:58.767
Oh, God, please help.

01:34:59.894 --> 01:35:01.612
Jesus...

01:35:01.654 --> 01:35:03.406
Holy Mary,

01:35:03.454 --> 01:35:05.331
Mother of Christ,

01:35:05.374 --> 01:35:07.046
please help us.

01:35:08.974 --> 01:35:10.885
Please help us.

01:35:12.054 --> 01:35:13.726
We're begging.

01:35:17.374 --> 01:35:19.490
Please save us.

01:36:19.494 --> 01:36:21.450
Oh, thank Christ.

01:36:29.534 --> 01:36:31.729
Here, take that back to the cleat.

01:36:35.934 --> 01:36:38.164
- What happened?
- I'm OK.

01:36:38.214 --> 01:36:40.728
- Sure?
- A shark hit us.

01:36:40.774 --> 01:36:42.651
Sean's out there.

01:36:42.694 --> 01:36:46.084
- What?
- He wanted to come.

01:36:46.134 --> 01:36:47.408
Where are they?

01:36:47.454 --> 01:36:51.049
They're in the current
heading for Cable Junction.

01:36:51.094 --> 01:36:54.564
All right, get to the lighthouse
and stay there, OK?

01:36:54.614 --> 01:36:57.208
- Stay there.
- I'm sorry, Dad.

01:36:57.254 --> 01:36:59.893
Forget it.
Just get to the lighthouse.

01:37:09.174 --> 01:37:11.688
- We're almost there.
- It's not gonna work.

01:37:11.734 --> 01:37:13.770
Come on, more to port.

01:37:13.814 --> 01:37:15.884
Keep it going. We'll make it.

01:37:16.734 --> 01:37:18.645
More to port, goddamn it!

01:37:18.694 --> 01:37:20.525
All the way over.

01:37:21.494 --> 01:37:25.089
Larry, are we going to make it
to the island?

01:37:25.134 --> 01:37:27.364
We're steering for it, kid.

01:37:28.294 --> 01:37:30.205
But the wind drift is lateral.

01:37:30.254 --> 01:37:31.687
What does that mean?

01:37:31.734 --> 01:37:35.044
It means that we're going sideways.
We're going that way.

01:37:35.094 --> 01:37:37.608
- We were heading right for it.
- Not now.

01:37:37.654 --> 01:37:40.612
Shit. Shit, shit, shit.

01:37:51.494 --> 01:37:53.485
Wait! Stop paddling.

01:37:53.534 --> 01:37:56.446
- What about the island?
- The shark!

01:38:20.774 --> 01:38:23.652
- What's happening?
- I think we're stuck.

01:38:23.694 --> 01:38:25.685
It's just the bottom.

01:38:25.734 --> 01:38:28.328
- It's that thing.
- It's just the bottom.

01:38:28.374 --> 01:38:33.164
No, it's not the bottom.
It's that thing! It's gonna kill us!

01:38:33.214 --> 01:38:34.613
Jackie, shut up!

01:38:34.654 --> 01:38:38.533
- No! It's going to kill us!
- Shut up! Shut up!

01:38:38.574 --> 01:38:40.212
Leave her alone!

01:38:40.254 --> 01:38:42.165
Then you take care of her.

01:38:42.214 --> 01:38:45.092
- She's hysterical, beating...
- Sit down.

01:38:45.134 --> 01:38:46.647
Be quiet!

01:38:47.894 --> 01:38:49.373
Shut up!

01:38:49.414 --> 01:38:50.847
Listen!

01:38:50.894 --> 01:38:53.328
- She shouldn't freak out.
- Listen!

01:38:55.414 --> 01:38:57.211
You hear it?

01:39:09.774 --> 01:39:12.493
Over there! It's coming towards us.

01:39:15.814 --> 01:39:17.167
It's Dad! Dad!

01:39:24.574 --> 01:39:25.973
Dad!

01:39:43.454 --> 01:39:47.447
Oh, cool. Cool, come on...

01:40:04.694 --> 01:40:06.764
Pull yourselves over
and we'll get out of here.

01:40:06.814 --> 01:40:10.409
We can't.
We're stuck on the bottom here.

01:40:10.454 --> 01:40:12.206
I'll get you closer.
We'll come aboard.

01:40:12.254 --> 01:40:15.166
- Pull us alongside.
- Please hurry!

01:40:15.214 --> 01:40:17.091
All right, hold it steady.

01:40:18.614 --> 01:40:19.967
Oh, sh...!

01:40:31.014 --> 01:40:32.003
Wait!

01:40:38.094 --> 01:40:39.413
Dad!

01:40:50.614 --> 01:40:52.650
I'm all right. Hold on.

01:41:01.334 --> 01:41:04.167
All right,
take this and I'll get you over.

01:41:10.454 --> 01:41:12.410
- All right, tie it on.
- OK.

01:41:22.734 --> 01:41:25.965
All right,
pull these hooks over with the rope.

01:41:26.014 --> 01:41:30.132
Secure them to the raft then I'll
pull you back with the winch, OK?

01:41:30.174 --> 01:41:31.607
OK.

01:41:57.014 --> 01:41:58.811
All right, pull it over.

01:42:11.574 --> 01:42:12.973
It's stuck.

01:42:13.014 --> 01:42:16.609
Wait a minute, I'll put...
I'll put it in reverse.

01:42:59.014 --> 01:43:00.333
Lucy!

01:43:00.374 --> 01:43:03.366
Lucy, look out!

01:43:03.414 --> 01:43:06.326
Oh, my God! No! No!

01:43:09.494 --> 01:43:11.086
Lucy!

01:43:19.614 --> 01:43:21.445
No!

01:43:22.254 --> 01:43:24.722
Oh, my God! No!

01:43:24.774 --> 01:43:25.923
Dad!

01:43:27.774 --> 01:43:29.287
Hold on!

01:43:57.734 --> 01:43:59.326
Dad!

01:44:06.574 --> 01:44:07.893
Get away!

01:44:07.934 --> 01:44:09.413
No!

01:44:12.894 --> 01:44:14.532
Get away!

01:44:28.054 --> 01:44:29.407
No!

01:44:35.934 --> 01:44:36.923
Sean!

01:45:35.494 --> 01:45:38.406
- Where'd he go?
- Where is he?

01:45:59.014 --> 01:46:01.403
- There he is!
- Over there.

01:46:13.974 --> 01:46:16.044
What the hell are you doing?

01:46:20.454 --> 01:46:22.172
Get out of there!

01:46:24.214 --> 01:46:26.364
He's heading right for you!

01:46:30.854 --> 01:46:33.414
All right, you big bastard, come on.

01:46:34.094 --> 01:46:35.925
I got something for you now.

01:46:38.414 --> 01:46:42.168
That's it! That a boy! Come on!

01:46:42.214 --> 01:46:43.567
Right over here!

01:46:43.614 --> 01:46:45.172
Dad!

01:46:45.214 --> 01:46:47.250
That's it. Come on.

01:46:47.294 --> 01:46:50.923
No! Get out of the way!

01:46:52.054 --> 01:46:53.203
Don't do it!

01:46:54.574 --> 01:46:56.883
Get away! Get away!

01:46:56.934 --> 01:46:58.765
Dad! Watch out!

01:46:58.814 --> 01:46:59.803
Come on!

01:46:59.854 --> 01:47:01.685
Look out!

01:47:01.734 --> 01:47:03.133
Open wide!

01:47:03.174 --> 01:47:05.608
Open wide, say "ah"!

01:47:35.614 --> 01:47:37.605
He did it. He got it!

01:48:02.254 --> 01:48:05.644
He did it! He did it! He did it!

01:48:05.694 --> 01:48:08.208
Did he get it? It's dead?

01:48:08.254 --> 01:48:10.245
It's dead!

01:48:19.454 --> 01:48:21.285
Oh, thank you.

01:48:21.334 --> 01:48:24.053
Thank you,
thank you, thank you...

01:48:38.054 --> 01:48:41.012
- And you...
- They made me go with them.

01:48:45.974 --> 01:48:47.168
Sure they did!
