00:37.454 --> 00:38.664
Help.

00:39.915 --> 00:41.250
Oh, my God.

00:42.793 --> 00:44.044
Oh, fuck!

00:44.837 --> 00:46.713
Oh, fuck!

00:49.383 --> 00:50.509
There, there, it's nothing.

00:50.509 --> 00:52.427
Oh, my God.
-They're just ants.

00:52.427 --> 00:56.056
Hey. Chill.
Pack your shit. We have to go now.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.140
What?

00:57.140 --> 00:58.851
We're leaving now. Come on.

01:00.018 --> 01:01.687
Hey. Now!

01:06.775 --> 01:07.776
Okay.

01:29.965 --> 01:31.675
Eric, it's good to meet you.

01:31.675 --> 01:34.011
Thanks so much for doing this
on such short notice.

01:34.011 --> 01:37.681
My pleasure. Anything I can do to help.
Please, let's sit down.

01:39.141 --> 01:40.100
TNC NOTICIAS

01:47.024 --> 01:51.320
Tonight, the husband
of an American scientist taken hostage

01:51.320 --> 01:55.073
in Colombia opens up
about the terrifying abduction.

01:55.073 --> 01:57.868
Sergeant, thank you very much
for having the time to talk to us.

01:57.868 --> 01:58.869
Thank you.

01:58.869 --> 02:01.580
Sergeant, what was the first thought
that you had when you knew

02:01.580 --> 02:03.874
that your wife had been kidnapped?

02:03.874 --> 02:07.586
I'm going to get her back safe in my arms
if I have to die trying.

02:07.586 --> 02:13.926
Our sources say that last night a boy
was shot and killed in a rescue operation.

02:13.926 --> 02:15.385
Is that something you'll confirm to us?

02:16.053 --> 02:17.930
I have no idea. I wasn't there.

02:18.430 --> 02:21.808
But I have it on good authority that
the Colombian military is all over this.

02:21.808 --> 02:23.977
They may have shot a kidnapper.
I don't know.

02:23.977 --> 02:27.523
Delta security operations
are highly classified,

02:27.523 --> 02:30.651
and it may never be known to the public.

02:30.651 --> 02:35.906
Is it safe to say that you would never
confirm an operation, something like this?

02:35.906 --> 02:40.035
Well, I can confirm this.
I want a mission.

02:40.035 --> 02:43.205
I want the Colombian military to step up.

02:43.205 --> 02:47.042
Are you suggesting that the Colombian
government isn't even trying?

02:49.002 --> 02:52.714
I'm suggesting there's always more
that can be done for an innocent woman.

02:52.714 --> 02:55.592
Sounds like you're
calling out the president of Colombia

02:55.592 --> 02:58.929
and perhaps the president
of the United States. Is that so?

02:59.930 --> 03:01.181
I do hope they're listening.

03:02.349 --> 03:04.142
<i>The buck stops at the top.</i>

03:04.142 --> 03:05.894
<i>Hey, man.</i>
-You fucked me.

03:06.395 --> 03:09.398
You fucking fucked me.
But I don't even care about that.

03:09.398 --> 03:10.941
You fucked yourself by going on CNN.

03:10.941 --> 03:13.652
<i>What part of "keep a low profile"
don't you understand?</i>

03:13.652 --> 03:15.946
Yeah, well,
isn't public pressure good for us?

03:16.613 --> 03:18.156
You're on speaker with Prince.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.325
<i>Hey, Prince.</i>
-Hey, Mitch.

03:20.325 --> 03:22.244
<i>Pressure's only good when I generate it.</i>

03:22.244 --> 03:24.705
You do realize now
that the comms guys at the White House

03:24.705 --> 03:27.374
and the political shop are gonna
take this over and focus-group it

03:27.374 --> 03:29.126
<i>every fucking step of the way.</i>

03:29.126 --> 03:32.546
Now, why would you want that
in an election year?

03:32.546 --> 03:35.757
We had no choice.
Everything's moving too slow.

03:35.757 --> 03:38.468
So you go shoot up an entire neighborhood

03:38.468 --> 03:41.263
and call out the Colombian president
on national television?

03:41.972 --> 03:43.348
<i>Super fucking dumb.</i>

03:43.849 --> 03:45.893
Do you really want the Colombian military
on this,

03:45.893 --> 03:48.604
<i>with their record of hostage rescue
and cross fire?</i>

03:48.604 --> 03:51.481
They shoot both the rebels
and the hostages.

03:51.481 --> 03:54.067
We're gonna be on their op.
Make sure she's safe.

04:13.504 --> 04:16.839
Be more careful. Nobody's fucking
carrying you if you twist an ankle.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.526
We're going in a circle.

04:36.610 --> 04:37.611
Hey.

05:08.642 --> 05:12.187
Set up your hammock
and get some sleep while you can.

05:14.857 --> 05:17.860
You bring us back fucking here!

05:26.702 --> 05:27.786
You're--

05:45.512 --> 05:46.889
ESCUELA MILITAR DE SUBOFICIALES
SARGENTO INOCENCIO CHINCA

05:46.889 --> 05:49.349
If everything was kept
on my side, in my house,

05:49.349 --> 05:51.810
maybe I could have worked it out.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.230
But now this operation
is no longer a secret.

05:55.230 --> 06:00.152
You see, we have a new spokesperson,
and he got us a new mission.

06:02.237 --> 06:03.697
We're going to engage.

06:06.033 --> 06:07.701
That's good news.

06:07.701 --> 06:11.872
So, when you're ready to launch,
attach us as advisers so we can help.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.292
Thanks for the offer, but no.

06:16.919 --> 06:17.920
Anything else?

06:17.920 --> 06:20.881
Yes, sir. We need to go there.

06:21.465 --> 06:22.508
No, you don't.

06:22.508 --> 06:27.095
We're requesting to be there.
Professional courtesy.

06:28.639 --> 06:31.975
Courtesy? You called us out on TV.

06:33.727 --> 06:37.606
Well, maybe your friends
in the CIA are gonna force us to take you,

06:37.606 --> 06:39.191
but I don't think so.

06:39.191 --> 06:42.653
Sir, we--
-Thank you, sir. We understand.

06:49.993 --> 06:52.329
We need to talk to him
outside of his office.

06:52.329 --> 06:53.497
What are you thinking?

06:53.497 --> 06:55.040
I'm gonna bribe his ass.

07:16.061 --> 07:18.397
Didn't Ernesto say the general
was coming alone?

07:19.773 --> 07:20.899
He did.

07:39.543 --> 07:42.588
Good afternoon, everyone.
Thank you for being here.

07:42.588 --> 07:45.841
Ernesto and I are so pleased
that you can join us

07:45.841 --> 07:50.220
for our 5th Gala fundraiser
of the Walasa Foundation.

07:54.766 --> 07:58.187
We are continuing to make a difference
in the lives of so many children

07:58.187 --> 08:00.981
suffering from violence in rural Colombia.

08:00.981 --> 08:01.940
Thank you very much.

08:05.485 --> 08:06.737
<i>"Despite progress,</i>

08:06.737 --> 08:10.824
<i>poverty and hunger are on the rise
in many parts of Colombia.</i>

08:10.824 --> 08:16.830
<i>Since we began, The Walasa Foundation
has helped nourish hundreds of children.</i>

08:16.830 --> 08:21.585
<i>Supplying meals in areas where
previously there were none.</i>

08:21.585 --> 08:26.048
<i>And we continue to fight
to provide relief to the little ones."</i>

08:27.216 --> 08:28.467
General.

08:29.134 --> 08:31.011
Thank you for inviting me.

08:32.054 --> 08:33.429
But why am I here?

08:33.429 --> 08:36.015
It's part of my job to
mingle with these people, Pereira.

08:36.975 --> 08:38.894
You are here to keep me from killing them.

08:41.480 --> 08:43.815
Don't complain. At least the food is good.

08:44.900 --> 08:45.817
<i>Gracias</i>.

08:45.817 --> 08:47.152
General.

08:53.075 --> 08:55.452
May I please speak with the
Colonel for a moment?

08:58.997 --> 09:00.415
<i>Gracias</i>.

09:02.918 --> 09:04.253
<i>General.</i>

09:04.253 --> 09:05.796
I know you're aware of...

09:07.798 --> 09:09.758
the terrible situation that my wife is in.

09:09.758 --> 09:10.676
<i>Sí</i>.

09:10.676 --> 09:15.055
And...
Well, I know we're asking for a favor.

09:16.515 --> 09:21.353
But if you can see your way fit to bending
the rules for us, just this once,

09:21.353 --> 09:24.314
I hope you'll also see your way
to letting us return the favor.

09:25.148 --> 09:27.192
Do you understand in which position
you put me in?

09:27.943 --> 09:30.112
You took advantage of my trust.

09:30.112 --> 09:34.575
You know, my family owns a company
with a lot of interests in the region.

09:34.575 --> 09:37.661
I could have had my snipers to shoot you.
You know that?

09:37.661 --> 09:38.579
But you didn't.

09:39.746 --> 09:42.499
Want to offer you a seat on the board
of Haas Industries.

09:42.499 --> 09:45.794
We meet three times a year.
It's a paid position.

09:49.214 --> 09:50.465
General.

09:51.049 --> 09:52.050
General.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.553
Thank you for coming.

09:55.345 --> 09:57.139
I'm sorry we didn't get a chance
to speak tonight.

09:57.139 --> 10:01.310
I would like to discuss the shooting
in Ciudad Bolívar.

10:01.310 --> 10:03.437
You should talk to the Narcotics Unit,
I'm not involved.

10:03.437 --> 10:05.856
Nevertheless,
I would like to hear your opinion.

10:05.856 --> 10:07.482
I'm sorry. I don't think so.

10:07.482 --> 10:09.401
Is that an official "no comment?"

10:10.444 --> 10:12.654
Listen, I really appreciate
your charitable spirit.

10:12.654 --> 10:13.614
But I know who you are.

10:14.907 --> 10:17.743
And I know, you have been treated better
here than in your own country.

10:17.743 --> 10:19.995
I'm sure you'd want to keep it that way.

10:21.038 --> 10:22.331
Excuse me.

10:33.634 --> 10:36.720
<i>This is Violeta Matíz,
and this is</i> "Bogotá Revealed,"

10:36.720 --> 10:37.804
<i>on 103.1 F.M.</i>

10:39.264 --> 10:42.809
<i>Many times on this show we have talked
about war</i>

10:42.809 --> 10:45.103
<i>and the terrible toll
it has taken on our country.</i>

10:46.063 --> 10:48.899
And while the war may be officially over,

10:48.899 --> 10:51.318
there is still violence.

10:51.318 --> 10:56.823
<i>I want to talk about an American woman
who was recently abducted outside Bogotá.</i>

10:57.741 --> 10:58.867
<i>Amber Chesborough.</i>

10:59.368 --> 11:04.206
Her brother Alex joins me in the studio
to deliver a message,

11:04.206 --> 11:07.709
as we have done on many occasions
on "<i>Kidnapped Voices</i>."

11:08.961 --> 11:12.631
I'll turn it over to her brother
so he can speak to her directly.

11:22.808 --> 11:24.059
Amber...

11:28.564 --> 11:35.445
if you're out there and you're listening,
it's me, and I'm on it.

11:38.448 --> 11:40.784
<i>We're all so worried about you, and...</i>

11:42.995 --> 11:47.082
<i>well, everyone's just waiting patiently
for the process to play out.</i>

11:47.958 --> 11:51.587
But you did nothing wrong, baby. Nothing.

11:58.093 --> 11:59.469
<i>We love you, baby.</i>

12:01.555 --> 12:03.974
<i>We're gonna find a peaceful way
out of this.</i>

12:05.434 --> 12:06.518
He's good.

12:06.518 --> 12:10.439
No, this is not good. It's shit.

12:11.607 --> 12:14.484
We're losing control of the narrative.

12:14.484 --> 12:16.695
<i>I need you to stay warm</i>

12:17.946 --> 12:21.909
<i>and stay dry, and be patient, okay?</i>

12:21.909 --> 12:24.411
<i>I'd like
to send a message to the kidnappers...</i>

12:24.411 --> 12:27.122
I'm here if you want to speak with me.

12:27.122 --> 12:28.081
To listen to you

12:29.249 --> 12:30.459
<i>without any conditions</i>

12:31.251 --> 12:34.213
<i>to deliver whatever message
you want to send to the world.</i>

12:34.963 --> 12:37.508
Let's tell the boss to bring that bitch.

12:44.723 --> 12:45.974
And we're out.

13:08.080 --> 13:09.289
What's wrong?

13:09.289 --> 13:11.416
Why don't we let the American go?

13:11.416 --> 13:12.334
<i>No.</i>

13:12.334 --> 13:16.713
I just think this whole plan
could get us killed.

13:16.713 --> 13:17.881
That's not going to happen.

13:18.507 --> 13:21.802
We have the advantage and have
worked too hard for this opportunity.

13:23.971 --> 13:25.889
<i>It's crazy to bring a journalist here</i>

13:25.889 --> 13:27.015
<i>to the middle of the jungle.</i>

13:27.015 --> 13:27.933
<i>I don't see the point.</i>

13:32.229 --> 13:34.565
<i>Relax. When we get to Venezuela,</i>

13:34.565 --> 13:38.819
the SEBIN will put an altar for us.

13:38.819 --> 13:40.237
They will kiss our feet.

13:40.237 --> 13:41.530
And that's what you want?

13:41.530 --> 13:43.365
I want respect!

13:44.199 --> 13:45.284
Wonderful.

13:46.368 --> 13:48.120
Poetic.

13:52.082 --> 13:56.879
To be able to hold an American
hostage is the ultimate.

13:57.504 --> 14:01.091
It shows that we are strong
and the government is weak.

14:01.091 --> 14:03.677
And to be able to break that illusion

14:04.428 --> 14:06.889
of a powerful
and authoritarian government.

14:06.889 --> 14:09.516
It legitimizes us
as a revolutionary movement.

14:09.516 --> 14:11.852
And it makes people think,

14:11.852 --> 14:16.106
"The government must be very weak
if it can't save one fucking American."

14:22.279 --> 14:25.073
<i>Once that idea gets planted like a seed,</i>

14:26.074 --> 14:27.951
<i>another one grows.</i>

14:28.702 --> 14:32.372
"If the government is that bad,
we have to change it."

14:32.372 --> 14:37.503
That's what we are doing,
giving hope to our people.

14:55.771 --> 14:58.440
Trust me.
-When have I ever not trusted you?

14:59.816 --> 15:00.943
I love you.

15:02.611 --> 15:03.862
Manipulator.

15:14.039 --> 15:16.375
For you. Hurry!

15:16.375 --> 15:18.085
Move. <i>Ándale.</i>

16:08.802 --> 16:10.095
The Comandante is waiting.

16:15.517 --> 16:17.936
Don't make him angry.

16:24.067 --> 16:25.694
Pleasure to meet you.

16:26.486 --> 16:27.946
The pleasure is mine.

16:27.946 --> 16:30.657
Did you have a good trip?

16:30.657 --> 16:32.868
You must be exhausted.

16:32.868 --> 16:35.120
Would you like some food or water?

16:35.120 --> 16:36.997
Or rest for a while?

16:36.997 --> 16:38.582
I'm fine.

16:38.582 --> 16:40.292
Sit.

16:47.591 --> 16:49.510
You know this is a mistake, right?

16:50.135 --> 16:51.803
And it will end badly.

16:53.555 --> 16:54.973
The mistake is theirs.

16:55.724 --> 16:57.476
They thought they were untouchable.

16:59.186 --> 17:01.188
And if this turns out bad, well,

17:01.188 --> 17:03.065
these are risks we take during war.

17:03.065 --> 17:05.608
If you really want to
teach a lesson, let her go.

17:06.276 --> 17:08.069
Nobody wants to return to the past.

17:09.404 --> 17:14.117
Some people do want another war
and we'll give it to them.

17:14.117 --> 17:17.287
If you release her,
I'll write a nice story about you.

17:17.287 --> 17:18.579
I would like that.

17:18.579 --> 17:22.917
But that's a bit too romantic
for things to end up that way.

17:22.917 --> 17:24.336
What are your goals?

17:25.045 --> 17:26.046
Who are you?

17:27.172 --> 17:28.173
I'm just a man.

17:29.383 --> 17:32.010
Trying to create a new atmosphere.

17:32.010 --> 17:33.554
A new mentality.

17:34.137 --> 17:36.139
And these are my friends.

17:38.267 --> 17:39.309
Talk to her.

17:40.644 --> 17:42.145
Tell me what you think.

17:43.647 --> 17:44.565
Think about what?

17:45.941 --> 17:47.734
Whether or not she is CIA.

17:48.360 --> 17:49.945
You think she will tell me?

17:50.737 --> 17:52.990
Find out. You can do it.

17:53.991 --> 17:55.033
Go ahead.

17:55.826 --> 17:56.827
Okay.

17:57.578 --> 17:59.329
Give me some time with her. I'll try.

17:59.872 --> 18:01.623
Let's get ready to move.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.105
Hello, Amber.

18:26.481 --> 18:30.652
I'm a journalist. I want to talk to you.
-I recognize your voice.

18:31.945 --> 18:33.488
From the radio.
-Yeah.

18:33.488 --> 18:35.324
Your brother is a friend.

18:36.658 --> 18:38.911
And your father-in-law
is my husband's friend.

18:38.911 --> 18:40.037
I wanna help you.

18:42.414 --> 18:43.498
Thank you.

18:50.422 --> 18:52.925
Do you know
why you were taken in this way?

18:54.593 --> 18:56.261
Wrong place, wrong time.

18:56.929 --> 18:59.515
They think I'm CIA.
It's fucking ridiculous.

19:00.974 --> 19:02.267
I know how you feel.

19:04.978 --> 19:05.938
I was kidnapped.

19:08.565 --> 19:12.736
I was in a very small room
during two months.

19:16.990 --> 19:18.992
I hope you don't go through that.

19:20.452 --> 19:24.498
But if you do,
you have to know you will survive.

19:27.835 --> 19:30.462
They want to know
if you're an American agent.

19:31.630 --> 19:33.382
I don't care if you are or not.

19:34.591 --> 19:39.304
I'm going to talk with the commander
right now and tell him you're innocent.

19:44.101 --> 19:47.062
You should stay with me. It's much safer.

19:53.819 --> 19:59.741
They're all gonna get killed
in this camp. Everyone.

20:02.411 --> 20:04.371
Don't fantasize of a rescue.

20:05.664 --> 20:08.250
They can't find this place
in the middle of the jungle.

20:08.250 --> 20:10.544
You don't know my family.

20:13.547 --> 20:15.757
<i>I guarantee you they tracked you here.</i>

20:17.926 --> 20:19.887
Why do you think my brother did your show?

20:22.764 --> 20:24.308
<i>You're a bird dog.</i>

20:26.143 --> 20:27.561
You flush out the prey.

20:28.437 --> 20:30.606
Time's up.

20:33.442 --> 20:35.319
Everything will be okay.
-Right.

20:48.707 --> 20:50.626
I have eyes on Violeta.

20:55.339 --> 20:57.508
I see at least 20% of the camp.

20:59.468 --> 21:00.886
Negative on Amber.

21:03.013 --> 21:04.681
Here she is.

21:04.681 --> 21:05.933
Come here.

21:07.017 --> 21:08.560
Tell me how it went.

21:10.771 --> 21:12.564
I do have something for you.

21:12.564 --> 21:13.690
She's not CIA.

21:13.690 --> 21:16.944
This is your professional opinion?
-<i>Sí</i>.

21:16.944 --> 21:19.696
After conducting interviews
for 20 years, I can confirm it.

21:19.696 --> 21:21.240
Let her leave with me.

21:31.333 --> 21:32.501
Graciela.

21:33.168 --> 21:34.127
Do something for me.

21:35.504 --> 21:37.548
Take her and tie her up.

21:37.548 --> 21:38.966
Then tell everyone we're moving out.

21:44.263 --> 21:45.764
We're moving out.

21:51.812 --> 21:53.814
They're packing up, getting ready to move.

21:55.065 --> 21:56.066
Colonel?

22:01.780 --> 22:04.241
We have located the rebel camp.

22:04.867 --> 22:06.493
Where they are holding
the American hostage.

22:08.370 --> 22:12.624
<i>Now they have a second hostage,
a journalist, Violeta Matíz.</i>

22:13.917 --> 22:16.170
What's happening?
-They believe you.

22:16.753 --> 22:18.172
We are going to intercept them here.

22:19.506 --> 22:20.674
We are going to surround them.

22:21.466 --> 22:23.218
We are going to make them desperate.

22:30.851 --> 22:34.146
<i>Force them to negotiate, to make mistakes.</i>

22:35.063 --> 22:36.982
<i>There are a lot of eyes watching us.</i>

22:39.651 --> 22:40.485
<i>Get ready.</i>

22:42.404 --> 22:43.572
Any questions?

22:46.408 --> 22:47.409
That's the way I like it.

22:48.327 --> 22:49.411
Commandos, move out!

23:32.162 --> 23:34.206
They're headed to the river.

23:36.124 --> 23:38.836
Do not engage. We're 10 minutes out.

26:58.911 --> 27:02.206
This is Colonel Pereira of the
Colombian National Army.

27:03.040 --> 27:05.667
You are completely surrounded.

27:05.667 --> 27:08.170
This is now my battleground.

27:08.962 --> 27:11.548
I decide what happens to you.

27:12.841 --> 27:16.595
No one will leave here alive
with Amber Chesborough or Violeta Matíz.

27:19.890 --> 27:22.100
You will all die here one by one.

27:22.100 --> 27:24.520
Unless you release the hostages.

27:26.188 --> 27:27.481
I have plenty of time.

27:30.734 --> 27:31.735
You decide.

27:50.754 --> 27:51.964
I have the Comandante.

27:55.342 --> 27:56.343
Fire.

28:02.432 --> 28:04.309
We just killed your Comandante.

28:04.309 --> 28:05.853
It was easy.

28:10.816 --> 28:12.693
I can stay here indefinitely.

28:14.695 --> 28:15.988
For hours...

28:17.656 --> 28:18.657
for weeks.

28:21.159 --> 28:22.411
You decide.

28:55.694 --> 28:57.154
Make the fucking call.

29:34.942 --> 29:37.611
They just blew up a café in Bogotá.

29:51.166 --> 29:53.627
This is Foster.
Connect me to the SecDef, please.

29:56.129 --> 29:58.090
Sir, we have a credible threat.

29:58.090 --> 30:00.175
They're claiming to have more bombs
throughout the city.

30:12.396 --> 30:14.064
General, we have them surrounded!

30:14.064 --> 30:15.732
I can capture them all!

30:15.732 --> 30:19.987
<i>It doesn't matter.
They threatened to bomb more civilians.</i>

30:19.987 --> 30:22.823
<i>This comes from the top.
From the White House and the CIA.</i>

30:22.823 --> 30:23.991
<i>Do you understand?</i>

30:23.991 --> 30:25.993
<i>They don't want more civilian casualties.</i>

30:32.457 --> 30:34.168
Attention, everyone.

30:34.168 --> 30:36.211
Abort, abort, abort.

30:37.129 --> 30:38.463
Retreat.

30:38.463 --> 30:40.007
We're headed back to base.

30:44.887 --> 30:46.263
There's nothing we can do.

31:51.245 --> 31:52.955
Fuck you!

31:53.789 --> 31:56.083
Yes! Fuck you!

32:03.006 --> 32:09.221
Fuck you! Fuck you!
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

32:17.604 --> 32:18.772
I love you.

33:33.639 --> 33:35.224
<i>Trust me, Colonel.</i>

33:35.224 --> 33:36.808
<i>I know. Politics.</i>

33:36.808 --> 33:40.145
<i>But we are under a lot of pressure
to withdraw.</i>

33:41.480 --> 33:42.689
<i>It's a sad day.</i>

33:42.689 --> 33:44.483
General, the day isn't over.

33:45.317 --> 33:47.778
It will take them 9 hours
to get to the border.

33:47.778 --> 33:51.532
Sir, if you can give me a bird,
we can take one more shot at this.

33:51.532 --> 33:54.284
<i>The media has us in a bad position.</i>

33:55.744 --> 33:57.079
It's our country, sir.

33:57.079 --> 33:58.163
<i>You're right.</i>

33:58.872 --> 34:00.082
<i>It's our country.</i>

34:01.083 --> 34:02.918
<i>I say this unofficially.</i>

34:03.502 --> 34:06.964
<i>Take volunteers
and do what you think is right.</i>

34:08.924 --> 34:10.551
Commandos...

34:12.803 --> 34:14.638
I need nine volunteers.

34:27.275 --> 34:28.485
<i>Caballeros.</i>

34:28.485 --> 34:32.281
We aren't done. Load up. We leave at dawn.

36:01.161 --> 36:02.579
<i>Signal intelligence say</i>

36:02.579 --> 36:05.165
<i>they are in trucks on a slow jungle road.</i>

36:05.165 --> 36:07.209
<i>We can cut across the jungle by air</i>

36:07.209 --> 36:08.752
<i>and beat them to the border.</i>

36:10.003 --> 36:12.130
<i>This spot here is the perfect ambush.</i>

36:13.090 --> 36:14.216
<i>Three guys on the ridge.</i>

36:14.216 --> 36:15.551
<i>The rest with me.</i>

36:15.551 --> 36:16.969
<i>We'll attack from the ground.</i>

36:57.718 --> 37:00.179
<i>IED armed and ready.</i>

37:00.179 --> 37:01.263
Check.

37:40.886 --> 37:45.682
All stations, all stations.
I will initiate on the lead vehicle.

38:36.984 --> 38:38.402
Bambi, what do you got?

38:59.840 --> 39:01.258
Not a lot of targets here.

39:01.258 --> 39:02.176
Roger.

40:39.773 --> 40:40.899
What are you seeing?

40:42.734 --> 40:44.278
Bambi, I got nothing.

40:55.914 --> 40:56.999
Fuck.

40:59.751 --> 41:01.420
<i>They're covered.</i>

41:04.173 --> 41:05.632
<i>All stations hold.</i>

41:14.892 --> 41:16.643
I've got more vehicles inbound.

41:19.146 --> 41:21.607
Prince, you've gotta fucking go.

41:21.607 --> 41:23.317
I can't see Amber.

41:24.776 --> 41:25.944
Thirty seconds out.

41:27.571 --> 41:30.240
Go! Fucking do something!

41:32.409 --> 41:34.286
<i>Prince, go now!</i>

41:45.506 --> 41:48.258
Prince, go, fucking go! Now!

41:50.302 --> 41:52.679
Colonel, I got Violeta!

42:06.818 --> 42:07.903
I'm moving down.

42:08.779 --> 42:10.822
Hold those trucks and cover me!
-Yeah!

43:09.882 --> 43:11.550
I got Amber!

43:54.468 --> 43:57.179
Alex!

44:01.642 --> 44:03.185
Alex!
