00:08.976 --> 00:10.776
I be spider-pirate! Er...

00:10.778 --> 00:13.056
(IMITATING PIRATE VOICE)
Spirate-Man for short. Arrr!

00:13.147 --> 00:15.547
Off the flipping plank
with you mutinous dog!

00:16.616 --> 00:18.050
(CRICKETS CHIRPING)

00:19.719 --> 00:21.387
Yeah, I'll just, er,

00:21.389 --> 00:23.088
see myself down the walk. Thanks.

00:25.492 --> 00:27.026
Hey, can I roll with you guys?

00:27.028 --> 00:28.733
My friends have ditched me.

00:29.063 --> 00:30.295
Or, never existed.

00:30.297 --> 00:32.731
(SCOFFS) No way, dude!

00:32.732 --> 00:34.199
You're like 50.

00:34.201 --> 00:36.368
Nobody gives old people candy.

00:36.370 --> 00:38.502
You get candy from the old people.

00:38.671 --> 00:39.886
Aw.

00:39.974 --> 00:40.681
(BEEP)

00:40.716 --> 00:42.496
Ah, before you ask the answer is no.

00:42.743 --> 00:44.543
I will not go trick
or treating with you.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.478
I'm like a serious grown-up, and stuff.

00:46.480 --> 00:47.646
Nova, come on!

00:47.648 --> 00:49.248
How can you not be into it?

00:49.250 --> 00:50.816
A, unlimited sugar,

00:50.818 --> 00:52.918
and B, it's fun being scared.

00:52.920 --> 00:55.883
Scared? A Nova never runs scared.

00:56.090 --> 00:58.709
Yeah? Even from a giant rabbit?

00:58.893 --> 01:03.262
A giant, (STAMMERS) rabbit?
Well, that's just dumb.

01:03.264 --> 01:05.755
No one, least of all me,
is scared of rabbits.

01:06.167 --> 01:07.818
NOVA: But on an unrelated note, er...

01:08.021 --> 01:08.825
(BEEP)

01:09.070 --> 01:11.429
Just for that, I'm bringing
you a chocolate bunny.

- Whoa!

01:15.842 --> 01:16.934
Hey, J.J.J.

01:16.935 --> 01:19.278
Aren't you, like, a million
years too old to be out here

01:19.280 --> 01:21.135
in knock-off
Spider-Man pajamas?

01:21.449 --> 01:22.748
Harsh disapproval.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.416
You sound
just like the real J.J.

01:24.418 --> 01:26.538
Ah, leave us alone, you menace.

01:26.687 --> 01:28.889
I just miss when I could
have fun on Halloween.

01:28.890 --> 01:30.556
Letting your imagination run wild.

01:30.758 --> 01:32.167
Scaring the webs off of people.

01:32.293 --> 01:32.888
Free candy.

(SONIC BLAST)

01:38.264 --> 01:39.043
Huh?

01:40.400 --> 01:44.303
Okay. I suppose it's too much
to hope that weird blast of magic

01:44.305 --> 01:45.803
just brings candy for the kids?

01:46.573 --> 01:48.273

(GROANING)

01:54.547 --> 01:55.587
Hey, kids.

01:55.950 --> 01:58.136
This is taking Halloween
a little too far.

01:58.618 --> 01:59.985
(YELLING)

01:59.987 --> 02:01.386
- Hiya!
- Ha.

02:01.388 --> 02:02.488
That's kind of cute.

02:02.490 --> 02:04.291
Kids turning into the
costumes they love...

02:04.492 --> 02:07.107
You know, if it wasn't
all so terrifying!

Whoa! Remember the trick
or treating we did together?

02:24.578 --> 02:26.145
Way back, like, three minutes ago?

02:26.147 --> 02:27.312
Good times, right?

02:27.314 --> 02:28.147
(SNARLING)

02:31.752 --> 02:33.908
Okay, so you're not much for nostalgia.

02:34.754 --> 02:36.736
Whoa! Oh!

02:38.058 --> 02:41.093
I had to get bit by a radioactive
spider to get my powers.

02:41.195 --> 02:42.902
You kids today have it too easy.

02:42.930 --> 02:44.997
And no! I don't want
you to bite me.

02:44.999 --> 02:46.165
(GROWLING)

02:48.234 --> 02:50.629
Maybe I'm not making myself clear.

Does this help?

02:53.373 --> 02:55.140
(GRUNTING)

(ELECTRIC HISSING)

02:59.747 --> 03:01.272
This must be city-wide.

I can't fix this alone.

03:03.784 --> 03:05.317
When there's something strange,

03:05.319 --> 03:07.134
there's only one man to see.

Trick or treat.
Smell my feet!

Argh! You could have
just said, "Come in!"

03:18.698 --> 03:20.199
(GRUNTS)

03:22.936 --> 03:24.136
So, true believers,

03:24.138 --> 03:27.006
this mystical powerhouse
is Dr. Stephen Strange,

03:27.008 --> 03:29.064
Earth's sorcerer supreme.

03:29.210 --> 03:31.143
He's the greatest magician alive.

03:31.145 --> 03:32.511
And, it looks like he's
already on the case.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.547
(CHANTING)

03:37.550 --> 03:39.423
Took the words right out of my mouth.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.178

03:45.226 --> 03:47.026
I'm afraid not, my friend.

03:47.028 --> 03:50.229
I've simply contained this monstrous
conflagration to the city.

03:50.231 --> 03:51.640
For now.

03:51.641 --> 03:54.366
And what exactly is this
monstrous conflu-what-now?

03:54.368 --> 03:56.016
And why didn't it affect me?

03:56.237 --> 03:57.970
I didn't even get to turn
into a real pirate.

03:57.972 --> 03:59.228
Er, spider!

03:59.229 --> 04:03.142
You're still protected by my
magics from our last encounter.

04:03.144 --> 04:05.878
But, if you desire, I can
create the illusion of you

04:05.880 --> 04:09.000
with eight eyes, eight limbs,
and a web-sacked abdomen.

04:09.250 --> 04:11.917
Nope, I'm fine with spandex, thanks.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.352
Speaking of spandex...

04:13.354 --> 04:15.154
Which baddie do
you think is behind this?

04:15.156 --> 04:17.822
Oh, there are many malevolent
inter-dimensional beings

04:17.825 --> 04:20.426
of great power, that would
use their evil magics

04:20.428 --> 04:22.511
to break through to the mortal plane.

04:22.730 --> 04:25.364
Around Halloween, the
barriers between the realms

04:25.366 --> 04:26.782
are at their weakest.

04:27.068 --> 04:31.008
So, how do we keep whichever boogeyman
it is from ruining Halloween?

04:31.105 --> 04:33.939
I fear that stopping
it is beyond my powers.

04:33.941 --> 04:36.408
No matter how deeply I scry
into the spell's source

04:36.410 --> 04:39.278
it seems to originate
at the quantum level.

04:39.280 --> 04:42.081
The tiny space between realms.

04:42.083 --> 04:44.474
I cannot reach into a space so small.

04:44.685 --> 04:46.198
Sounds like we need to get small.

04:46.477 --> 04:47.852
Real small.

04:47.955 --> 04:51.290
I could attempt to transform
you into a tiny spider.

04:51.292 --> 04:55.194
- By the Eye of Agamotto, I command...
- Wait!

04:55.196 --> 04:56.635
I didn't mean that.

04:57.198 --> 04:58.876
I've a different bug in mind.

Hey, Ant-man?

05:06.573 --> 05:08.407

05:08.409 --> 05:11.043
I don't recall him being an actual ant.

05:11.045 --> 05:12.211
That's because he's not.

05:12.213 --> 05:13.979
The wave must have changed him.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.170
Just like the kids!

implement a reversal spell.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.400
(GRUNTING)

05:37.937 --> 05:41.306
Hey, can't we talk about this
like two rational insects?

05:41.308 --> 05:42.790
Hold him there.

05:43.077 --> 05:45.177
I'm sure my webs can hold a giant ant.

05:45.179 --> 05:46.246
Maybe.

05:46.347 --> 05:50.261
By the Wandering Mists of Brittanthany!

05:52.152 --> 05:53.701
(GROANING)

05:55.321 --> 05:57.356
Oh, what happened?

05:57.358 --> 06:01.160
And, why do I suddenly feel
the urge to crash a picnic?

06:01.162 --> 06:05.364
Well, let's just say you can check being a
giant man-eating ant off your bucket list.

06:05.366 --> 06:07.199
You're only back to normal
thanks to Dr. Strange

06:07.201 --> 06:08.967
breaking the magic
spell's effect on you.

06:08.969 --> 06:12.504
Wait... What... You're...
The Dr. Strange?

06:12.506 --> 06:14.173
And you did magic on me?

06:14.175 --> 06:19.311
Ha! Erm, sorry. It's just
that I'm your biggest fan.

06:19.313 --> 06:23.048
Er, you know what, I'm a bit of
an amateur magician myself. Yeah.

06:24.984 --> 06:26.118
Observe.

06:26.120 --> 06:28.787
A bunny, huh, okay.

06:28.789 --> 06:30.189
And...

06:30.191 --> 06:32.621
Voila! No bunny.

06:33.160 --> 06:37.083
- You just shrank it down, didn't you?
- What? No...

06:37.197 --> 06:39.565
Okay, yes. But...

06:39.567 --> 06:43.168
No magician ever tells his
secrets, huh, Dr. Strange, huh?

06:43.170 --> 06:44.223
(CLEARS THROAT)

06:44.224 --> 06:45.551
Mr. Lang,

06:45.573 --> 06:48.006
the mystical arts
are not parlor tricks.

06:48.008 --> 06:52.544
The magical realm requires knowledge that
would shatter the minds of most mortals.

06:52.546 --> 06:54.213
Ooh, gotcha.

06:54.215 --> 06:55.847
Smoke and mirrors, huh?

06:55.849 --> 06:59.051
Look, Scott, whatever evil enchantment
turned you into the man-ant

06:59.053 --> 07:00.986
has turned New York's
children into demons,

07:00.988 --> 07:02.854
and is gonna destroy the city.

07:02.856 --> 07:05.357
We need your help to shrink
down, and find the source.

07:05.359 --> 07:06.758
Oh, how small?

07:06.760 --> 07:08.002
The quantum realm.

07:08.003 --> 07:10.653
We're going into the
fabric of magic itself.

07:10.863 --> 07:12.431
That, I can do.

07:12.433 --> 07:14.399
Anything for a fellow magician.

07:14.401 --> 07:17.028
You work your magic,
and I'll work mine.

07:17.053 --> 07:17.904
(CHUCKLES)

07:17.905 --> 07:21.139
Just think, two magicians,
fighting side by side.

07:22.108 --> 07:23.900
One magician.

07:25.646 --> 07:27.002
There is no time to waste.

07:27.014 --> 07:29.175
This portal will take us
where we need to go.

07:29.450 --> 07:31.416
And my patented Pym Particle Projector

07:31.418 --> 07:34.178
will make sure we're
the right fit. Up top!

07:36.256 --> 07:38.991
Yeah, all right. I'll just, er...
(CLEARS THROAT)

07:39.292 --> 07:40.624
Start it up.

07:41.861 --> 07:43.271

Welcome to the quantum realm.

ANT-MAN: These super-strings are
the foundation of all matter.

07:57.778 --> 07:59.812
Then they really must matter.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.074
Like you weren't thinking
of that joke, too.

08:10.790 --> 08:12.124
(ENERGY CRACKLING)

08:17.463 --> 08:18.081
There.

08:18.081 --> 08:21.506
The source of the dread magical
energy is coming from ahead.

08:24.804 --> 08:26.335
It's Baron Mordo!

08:26.807 --> 08:29.441
We battled this
wannabe-sorcerer before, but...

08:29.443 --> 08:31.011
I thought he was destroyed.

08:31.145 --> 08:33.712
ANT-MAN: He seems alive
and well, and not alone.

08:34.280 --> 08:35.715
Welcome.

08:35.783 --> 08:37.054
Friends.

08:37.078 --> 08:38.482

he's being sarcastic.

You were destined to be squashed under
my boot the moment you were born.

crush them!

09:00.707 --> 09:02.674
By the hosts of Hoggoth!

09:02.676 --> 09:05.866
To make Dormammu his slave,
Mordo would need power that...

09:05.879 --> 09:09.481
That is beyond your
comprehension, Strange.

09:09.483 --> 09:12.287
It's cute how you guys finish
each other's sentences like that.

09:16.689 --> 09:20.678
So, giant flamey-head and cackling
beard-guy don't normally work together?

09:25.631 --> 09:26.698
(GRUNTS)

09:29.736 --> 09:32.134
No, teaming up with
randoms is more my beat.

09:34.006 --> 09:36.383
Wait, what?
He's Ultron now?

09:36.477 --> 09:38.477
SPIDER-MAN: Oh, come on, that's
got to be against the rules.

09:38.479 --> 09:40.812
Impossible! It has
to be an illusion.

09:40.814 --> 09:43.854
Ultron is a highly complex
artificial intelligence.

09:46.486 --> 09:48.286
(GRUNTING)

09:49.489 --> 09:51.319
That's one tough illusion.

09:54.394 --> 09:57.271
This power is far beyond
Mordo's capabilities.

09:57.564 --> 09:59.564
Perhaps he, too, is a mere illusion?

09:59.566 --> 10:00.866
(LAUGHING)

10:00.868 --> 10:04.035
Or, perhaps, just a bad dream, Stephen?

10:04.037 --> 10:06.705
I'm afraid I'm all too real.

10:06.707 --> 10:11.078
In our last encounter I was scattered
across dimensions by the Siege Perilous,

10:11.079 --> 10:15.401
but now I've made myself more
powerful than you can imagine.

10:17.583 --> 10:20.244
Oh, wow! I really should've
seen this coming.

10:20.521 --> 10:23.422
At this size I can see you've
really got some clogged pores, Doc.

10:23.424 --> 10:26.324
You might
wanna try... Whoa!

10:27.627 --> 10:28.794
Ahhh!

10:29.462 --> 10:30.529
Ahhh!

10:30.531 --> 10:33.865
Whoa! That was
wildly disorienting.

10:33.867 --> 10:36.468
So, what? We all face
our ultimate villains?

10:36.470 --> 10:38.103
You don't suppose I could
convince him my ultimate villain

10:38.105 --> 10:40.282
is a delicious ice-cream
sandwich, do you?

(LAUGHS) Yup.
This guy is Albert.

11:45.706 --> 11:47.706
I found him at a five-star restaurant.

11:47.708 --> 11:50.609
He is a fiend for white Alba truffles.

11:50.611 --> 11:52.644

You wish.

12:42.763 --> 12:44.563
But I think I figured this out.

12:44.565 --> 12:46.731
The power is in Baron Mordo.

12:46.733 --> 12:49.210
He's using his own mind
to create our nemesises.

12:49.569 --> 12:51.603
Wait, nemesi?

12:51.605 --> 12:52.868
Nemisises?

12:53.006 --> 12:55.240
If you're right, whatever
happened to Mordo

12:55.242 --> 12:56.741
has now allowed him to manipulate

12:56.743 --> 12:59.344
the very nature of reality itself,

12:59.346 --> 13:02.447
by drawing the power directly
from the quantum realm.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.749
Nemisise, nemeseses?

13:04.751 --> 13:06.618
If this place is
the source of his power,

13:06.620 --> 13:08.920
then logically, if we can
get him away from here,

13:08.922 --> 13:10.689
we can turn off this magic.

13:10.691 --> 13:12.757
Oh, and it's nemeses.

13:14.460 --> 13:18.363
If you can lure him, I can create
a portal back to our world.

13:18.365 --> 13:20.532

Come on, up high!

Guys, I don't think it's that simple.

13:25.772 --> 13:27.706
No, really, it's nemeses.

13:27.708 --> 13:29.941
I mean, I don't think simply
sending him back to our world

13:29.943 --> 13:31.495
is gonna take away his power.

13:31.812 --> 13:33.778
We might be making a huge mistake.

With respect, Spider-Man, we
