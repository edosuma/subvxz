WEBVTT

00:09.610 --> 00:12.710
-Roz, who's our last caller?
-On line two we have Marilyn.

00:12.860 --> 00:16.110
-She's feeling a little
homesick. -Go ahead, Marilyn.

00:16.300 --> 00:19.449
<i>Well, I like living in Seattle
but, I don't know...</i>

00:19.484 --> 00:21.400
<i>I grew up in this
little town in Wisconsin...</i>

00:21.600 --> 00:23.213
<i>...and I really miss that life.</i>

00:23.248 --> 00:25.600
Well, you're not the only one.
My producer Roz...

00:25.820 --> 00:30.320
...has regaled me with many
stories of the great Dairy State.

00:30.480 --> 00:32.858
You're from Wisconsin,
Roz? What part?

00:32.893 --> 00:36.480
-Bloomer.
-Oh my God, I'm from Monomeney.

00:36.980 --> 00:38.809
No way! You're from Menomonie?

00:38.844 --> 00:41.200
My cousins are from Menomonie,
do you know the Rayburns?

00:41.400 --> 00:44.000
<i>Billy Rayburn is your cousin?</i>

00:44.200 --> 00:47.700
<i>I used to work with him
at Bell's Frozen Custard!</i>

00:47.910 --> 00:49.696
Do you remember that guy
that used the run the store...

00:49.731 --> 00:51.210
...with all the moles?

00:51.420 --> 00:54.420
Mr. Sneedy.

00:54.920 --> 00:58.720
Ladies, as fascinating as this
is, I'm afraid we're out of time.

01:01.920 --> 01:03.943
That's okay, Marilyn, you
can call back tomorrow.

01:03.978 --> 01:05.420
Make sure you all
tune in tomorrow...

01:05.620 --> 01:10.020
...for Part 2 in our series,
"Women of the Cheese Belt."

01:12.420 --> 01:15.520
Goodbye for now, and
good mental health.

01:17.190 --> 01:20.690
These messages came for you
earlier, your wines are ready.

01:20.910 --> 01:23.459
Oh, excellent.
I'm hosting a tasting tonight...

01:23.494 --> 01:25.210
...for the wine club
Niles and I belong to.

01:25.400 --> 01:27.069
I'm hoping they name
me the Maitre d'Chai.

01:27.104 --> 01:28.600
It's a long-standing
dream of mine...

01:28.830 --> 01:32.430
...to wear that silver
cup around my neck.

01:32.620 --> 01:35.720
You know, back in Wisconsin if a guy
wore a cup around his neck...

01:35.920 --> 01:38.720
-...it meant he'd ticked off
the gym teacher. -Fine!

01:38.910 --> 01:41.810
Make sport, but this does
happen to be important to me.

01:42.030 --> 01:44.154
Since when? You used to say
that club was nothing...

01:44.189 --> 01:46.530
...but a bunch of arrogant
cork-sniffing snobs.

01:46.710 --> 01:49.410
Well, that was
before I got in.

01:49.930 --> 01:51.847
Well, when I'm handing
out baloney sandwiches...

01:51.882 --> 01:53.530
...this weekend at
the homeless shelter...

01:53.740 --> 01:55.788
...it will do me heart good to know
that a bunch of wealthy men...

01:55.823 --> 01:58.040
...are swishing two-hundred-dollar
bottles of wine...

01:58.200 --> 02:01.400
...and spitting it
into silver buckets!

02:02.050 --> 02:04.850
It's not like we don't
recycle the bottles.

02:06.000 --> 02:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:13.420 --> 02:15.620
Bottle six.

02:25.420 --> 02:29.420
Big, full-bodied, nicely baked.

02:29.720 --> 02:32.720
Essence of truffles,
long finish...

02:32.930 --> 02:35.730
-Chambertin 76'.
-Bravo, Frasier.

02:36.330 --> 02:39.530
If only your aim
were as accurate.

02:39.830 --> 02:42.554
How is it those same taste
buds can't tell the difference...

02:42.589 --> 02:44.630
...between my pot roast
and my flank steak?

02:44.840 --> 02:46.281
Well, considering you
learned to cook in England...

02:46.316 --> 02:50.090
...it's a wonder I can tell your flank
steak from a braised tennis ball.

02:50.530 --> 02:53.830
Now, now, let's move on
to the number seven.

02:58.620 --> 03:00.320
Ah, touch of oak.

03:00.550 --> 03:03.550
Hint of currant.
Whisper of...

03:03.850 --> 03:07.150
...what is that, what is
that? Oh yes, wet dog!

03:08.660 --> 03:11.060
You guys still
playing that stupid game?

03:11.250 --> 03:14.750
Dad, wine tasting is not a stupid
game - it's a highly refined skill.

03:14.950 --> 03:16.694
Yeah, I just saw a couple of
guys on the corner...

03:16.729 --> 03:19.450
...practising out of paper bags.

03:21.020 --> 03:22.451
We're hardly winos.

03:22.486 --> 03:25.120
Some very distinguished
people belong to our club.

03:25.360 --> 03:27.474
The mayor, the
commissioner of public safety...

03:27.509 --> 03:29.860
...the chief of surgery at St. Lukes...

03:30.120 --> 03:33.920
Oh, just the people I want
walking around all liquored up.

03:34.150 --> 03:36.140
Could you find room
for a school bus driver...

03:36.175 --> 03:38.850
...and a couple of
air traffic controllers?

03:39.100 --> 03:42.600
Well, we would if they
had impeccable taste.

03:43.260 --> 03:46.160
Which reminds me dad,
I have a favour to beg.

03:46.630 --> 03:48.620
Would you mind if I moved
your chair into your room...

03:48.655 --> 03:50.630
-until after the tasting?
-Forget it...

03:50.800 --> 03:52.535
...you might as well ask me
to stay in my room.

03:52.570 --> 03:54.900
Which takes care of
the second favour.

03:58.360 --> 04:00.460
Oh, all right, move it.

04:00.630 --> 04:01.742
At least I don't have
to spend the night...

04:01.777 --> 04:04.330
...watching your society
pals getting tanked.

04:04.840 --> 04:07.340
Okay, Niles, grab an end.

04:09.830 --> 04:13.930
-Oh, you're serious. You know
I don't lift. -Yes...

04:14.360 --> 04:15.463
...with that stick where it...

04:15.498 --> 04:18.160
...I'm surprised you
can bend. Start hoisting.

04:27.050 --> 04:30.450
-Oh, God!
-No Niles, don't drop it!

04:31.560 --> 04:33.759
You better be talking about the floor.

04:33.794 --> 04:35.560
Oh, of course I'm
talking about the floor...

04:36.140 --> 04:38.340
Oh, for Pete's sake,
it's just a little scratch.

04:38.520 --> 04:39.989
Get me a yellow magic marker.

04:40.024 --> 04:42.320
I'll color it in, no one'll
know the difference.

04:43.040 --> 04:45.300
Dad, you have no idea how
critical these people can be.

04:45.335 --> 04:46.640
They love finding fault.

04:46.850 --> 04:49.650
We could put a rug over it.

04:51.240 --> 04:54.940
A rug? Where a rug
doesn't belong?

04:55.350 --> 04:57.022
Why don't you just
throw down a Twister mat.

04:57.057 --> 04:59.850
Have a few rounds
between vintages?!

05:00.950 --> 05:02.502
Steady Frasier, there's still hope.

05:02.537 --> 05:05.450
I'll bring my contractor by in
the morning. The man's a genius.

05:05.700 --> 05:06.840
You know, it's time
you guys learned...

05:06.875 --> 05:08.700
...everything doesn't
have to be perfect.

05:08.820 --> 05:12.820
Yes, it's that kind of advice
that leads to shag carpeting!

05:17.470 --> 05:18.579
Ah, good morning Daphne.

05:18.614 --> 05:21.370
Extra pancakes for me this
morning! I'm famished!

05:21.530 --> 05:23.199
Yes, well you should have
thought about that last night...

05:23.234 --> 05:26.630
...before you started making
cracks about English cooking.

05:26.950 --> 05:29.950
I have hung up my spatula.

05:31.570 --> 05:35.370
Well, you moved my chair,
you cut off my pancake supply;

05:35.640 --> 05:37.436
why don't you just
back out over Eddie...

05:37.471 --> 05:40.040
...on your way to work
and make it a hat trick?

05:42.450 --> 05:44.163
And a hat trick would be?

05:44.198 --> 05:47.350
-It's in hockey where one player...
-Enough said, thank you.

05:49.350 --> 05:50.756
-Niles.
-Good morning, Frasier.

05:50.791 --> 05:52.850
I'm delivering one miracle
worker as promised.

05:53.050 --> 05:56.050
-Joe DeCarlo, Frasier Crane. And
my father, Martin Crane. -Hi, Joe.

05:56.190 --> 05:58.390
-Where's the scratch?
-Oh, you mean you didn't see it?

05:58.560 --> 05:59.997
We were going to put some
orange cones around it...

06:00.032 --> 06:02.560
...so nobody would fall in it!

06:05.800 --> 06:07.800
It's right here.

06:09.190 --> 06:11.590
-I can get rid of that.
-It has to be done by five.

06:11.860 --> 06:15.245
My guests arrive at seven,
so it has to be a firm five.

06:15.280 --> 06:16.260
Not a five-fifteen or a five-thirty.

06:16.470 --> 06:19.870
-I'll be done by noon. -Splendid.
-I told you he was good.

06:20.060 --> 06:21.978
We're talking about a man
who has satisfied Maris.

06:22.013 --> 06:25.660
Something that's still
regrettably on my to-do list!

06:28.770 --> 06:31.711
Coffee's ready. Of course,
I'm sure it'll taste...

06:31.746 --> 06:33.470
...like my old bath water to you.

06:33.630 --> 06:36.173
You know, how it gets
all grey and scummy...

06:36.208 --> 06:38.630
...around the edges with
little flecks of... Oh, hello.

06:38.870 --> 06:42.170
-Hi.
-Hello.

06:43.630 --> 06:46.230
I'd love some coffee, Daphne.

06:49.750 --> 06:51.750
Hmm, Daphne?

06:53.480 --> 06:55.772
Er, Daph, this is Joe DeCarlo.
Joe, this is Daphne.

06:55.807 --> 06:56.980
She helps me out around here.

06:57.290 --> 07:02.290
-Smells great. Columbian?
-No, English.

07:06.790 --> 07:12.390
-The coffee - Costa Rican.
Would you like a cup? -Thanks.

07:12.670 --> 07:14.470
I'll be right back.

07:15.090 --> 07:19.290
-He's adorable, talk me up.
-A plate of pancakes. -Deal.

07:20.270 --> 07:23.270
You know, Joe,
Daphne's a great gal.

07:23.880 --> 07:26.680
-You know, she doesn't always go
round in that ratty old bathrobe.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.480
She cleans up real cute.

07:30.600 --> 07:33.900
-You don't have to convince me.
-You know, I think dad's right...

07:34.060 --> 07:37.760
...you don't need to fix that scratch,
it adds character. Come, Joe.

07:37.990 --> 07:42.390
-Niles, forget it!
-Honeybun? -Yes.

07:47.700 --> 07:52.200
-I meant would you like one of these
with your coffee? -Oh, I'd love one.

07:52.490 --> 07:55.890
-Anything...? -No.
-Sugar? -Yes.

07:56.590 --> 07:58.890
I meant in the coffee.

08:02.010 --> 08:04.534
Maris is quite keen
on gutting my library...

08:04.569 --> 08:06.910
...to make more space for her hats.

08:07.150 --> 08:08.389
Why don't you come home with me...

08:08.424 --> 08:11.050
...and you can send one of your
men over to do this little job.

08:11.220 --> 08:12.295
Bruce would be good.

08:12.330 --> 08:15.520
The large sweaty gentleman
with the chili dogs on his breath.

08:15.780 --> 08:19.480
Niles, Joe is here already and
we do have a deadline. -But...

08:19.680 --> 08:20.855
...don't you think it
would be prudent...

08:20.890 --> 08:22.780
-Niles, it's settled.
-That's great...

08:22.990 --> 08:25.690
...because I'm kinda
anxious to get at her.

08:26.690 --> 08:28.015
I'll just bet he is...

08:28.050 --> 08:30.590
-the testosterone is just dripping...
-Niles.

08:30.810 --> 08:35.110
-Niles, he's talking about the scratch.
-I knew that!

08:35.580 --> 08:39.280
Only I know that!
I mean, watch him!

08:44.410 --> 08:49.110
-Someone remodelling? -No,
bad wiring in one of the condos.

08:49.820 --> 08:51.584
Ah, well I hope you won't
be here this evening.

08:51.619 --> 08:54.020
I'm entertaining some
very important guests...

08:54.100 --> 08:55.916
...and you know how sound
travels in this building.

08:55.951 --> 08:57.700
Ah, can't make any promises.

08:57.860 --> 09:01.560
We're here as long as this
poor sap is willing to pay us.

09:10.880 --> 09:13.780
-What is happening?
-Hold on, guys.

09:14.120 --> 09:15.506
Er, sorry about this, Dr. Crane...

09:15.541 --> 09:19.420
...but I plugged in the sander to
start on the floor, you blew a circuit.

09:19.700 --> 09:22.900
So naturally you're
sawing a hole into my wall.

09:23.100 --> 09:24.964
The circuit blew - it started a fire.

09:24.999 --> 09:26.900
You've got some
real bad wiring in here.

09:27.100 --> 09:31.200
-But how long? -A couple
of hours. -"A couple" is vague.

09:31.420 --> 09:33.250
That would mean the big hand
would be on the twelve...

09:33.285 --> 09:35.720
-...and the little hand would
be...? -On the four.

09:36.020 --> 09:38.620
On the four? Oh,
the four is okay, fine.

09:38.860 --> 09:40.898
You know the fire,
Eddie smelled it first.

09:40.933 --> 09:44.760
Oh, well he's a regular canary
in a coal mine, isn't he!

09:46.630 --> 09:49.952
-My God, what's going on?
-Don't ask, Niles.

09:49.987 --> 09:51.730
Oh, I see you've got
the Romani Containe.

09:51.880 --> 09:54.559
Yes, but unfortunately they
only had the one bottle.

09:54.594 --> 09:54.880
That's funny...

09:55.100 --> 09:58.700
-...the importer told me he
had two. -Really? How strange.

10:03.300 --> 10:04.428
You know, if I didn't
know you better...

10:04.463 --> 10:07.300
...I would swear you had
squirreled one away for yourself.

10:07.530 --> 10:10.930
But then we both know that
you must be telling the truth...

10:11.050 --> 10:13.166
...because you're such a slave to
your ethics that even the slightest...

10:13.201 --> 10:17.050
...transgression would cause
your nose to bleed.

10:18.730 --> 10:20.830
Which it isn't!

10:21.670 --> 10:26.270
-You just sniffed. -I didn't
sniff, it was a snort of contempt.

10:26.820 --> 10:29.720
A snort is out, that was in.

10:29.930 --> 10:32.687
Oh, alright - the other
bottle's in the car...

10:32.722 --> 10:35.330
-...in my bowling bag.
-Thank you.

10:36.130 --> 10:38.097
You have a bowling bag?

10:38.132 --> 10:42.430
Yes. Maris and I have taken
to giving each other gag gifts.

10:43.310 --> 10:46.210
I gave her a cook book.

10:47.220 --> 10:49.120
Oh, yoohoo.

10:51.080 --> 10:55.280
I noticed how your shirt was
clinging to your back and...

10:56.230 --> 11:00.330
-I thought a nice cup of iced tea
might hit the spot. -Thanks, Daph.

11:01.940 --> 11:04.340
-Ho-ho, I got a spark.
-Me, too.

11:04.530 --> 11:08.130
That's just static electricity from
the carpet - it can happen to anyone.

11:08.280 --> 11:11.080
-I'll show you.
-Niles?!

11:16.200 --> 11:18.800
Stop poking me!

11:20.130 --> 11:23.085
Should I put these little fingery
foods for tonight in the fridge?

11:23.120 --> 11:25.330
Oh, yes please - the Brie
is sweating up a storm.

11:25.540 --> 11:26.634
Let me help you with those.

11:26.669 --> 11:29.740
No Daphne, let me help you.
Excuse me, Bruce.

11:30.220 --> 11:33.020
Spark! Spark!
Did you see the...

11:36.550 --> 11:41.250
I will be back after work
at five-thirty - I hope...

11:41.430 --> 11:45.130
...I have your word that my apartment
will be perfect for then. -Okay.

11:45.280 --> 11:48.680
Alright, think think before you answer.
This is not like marriage vows...

11:48.840 --> 11:52.040
...or a promise to a dying parent.
This really, really counts.

11:53.310 --> 11:56.310
-You have my word.
-Thank you.

11:56.650 --> 11:59.560
God, I'm sweating like a pig.
I've got to air myself out.

11:59.595 --> 12:00.550
Hey, hold the elevator, will ya?

12:00.740 --> 12:03.740
I'm sorry, I need this
nose tonight, thank you.

12:06.140 --> 12:08.140
You don't have to
keep feeding these men.

12:08.340 --> 12:11.640
Actually, Maris finds they work
faster if you keep them hungry.

12:12.240 --> 12:14.336
Hee hee, I don't mind. Of course,
I probably don't cook...

12:14.371 --> 12:17.040
...as well as their wives
or girlfriends.

12:17.800 --> 12:20.365
That is, if they all have girlfriends.

12:20.400 --> 12:24.200
I'm sure Joe's probably
mentioned some girl to you.

12:26.230 --> 12:28.530
-No.
-Really?

12:28.940 --> 12:31.240
That is... not any one girl.

12:31.450 --> 12:35.450
Not old "love'em
and leave'em" Joe.

12:35.760 --> 12:38.960
From what I've heard, he's wrecked
more homes than he's fixed.

12:39.140 --> 12:41.253
Mimsie Stanshope has him
over all the time...

12:41.288 --> 12:44.440
...and I don't just mean
to strip her entryway.

12:45.760 --> 12:49.960
-Oh, I see.
-I'm sorry, Daphne.

12:50.260 --> 12:52.757
No, it's better I should know
now before I get my hopes up.

12:52.792 --> 12:55.860
Thank you for being
honest with me.

13:22.140 --> 13:26.840
-Joe... -Dr. Crane, don't panic,
I can explain everything. -Wonderful.

13:27.040 --> 13:31.040
Perhaps you can
explain these legs.

13:31.470 --> 13:33.857
That's Cecil. He's the best
ceiling guy in Seattle.

13:33.892 --> 13:35.070
We were lucky to get him.

13:35.270 --> 13:37.102
When we opened up the wall
to get to the faulty wiring...

13:37.137 --> 13:40.470
...we found that the gas pipes leading
to your fireplace were cracked.

13:40.670 --> 13:43.570
-Had to be fixed.
-Tonight? -I OK'd it.

13:43.770 --> 13:47.270
It just seemed wiser to do
it before the explosion.

13:50.370 --> 13:53.866
Frasier, the club members
arrive in forty-five minutes.

13:53.901 --> 13:54.670
Have you lost your...

13:54.910 --> 13:56.910
Cecil!

13:59.170 --> 14:00.870
Niles, don't yell at me.

14:01.040 --> 14:02.146
If you were able to
lift anything heavier...

14:02.181 --> 14:04.740
...than an emory board we
wouldn't be in this position.

14:04.920 --> 14:06.690
Maybe next time you'll
listen to your old man.

14:06.725 --> 14:08.420
Thank you, dad. You know,
I was just considering whether...

14:08.550 --> 14:11.350
...I should go shave or slit my wrists.
You made my choice a little easier.

14:11.570 --> 14:16.170
Don't worry, we are gonna make
it. Only... about that shaving.

14:16.570 --> 14:19.270
We had to shut the water
off to replace a valve.

14:19.450 --> 14:23.050
Oh, well, that explosion idea's
sounding better and better.

14:23.650 --> 14:26.750
Could someone at least move that
mantle piece away from the door!

14:28.050 --> 14:32.250
Hello?
Just hold on, will you?

14:35.550 --> 14:37.850
Hey Joe, you know...

14:38.080 --> 14:39.004
...you're going to be
through by seven?

14:39.039 --> 14:42.080
It gives you plenty of time
for a dinner and a movie.

14:46.480 --> 14:48.580
Excuse me...

14:53.370 --> 14:56.670
I said I don't want
to go out with you!

14:59.970 --> 15:02.770
Whatcha looking at?
Get back to work!

15:03.190 --> 15:07.690
-Thanks a lot! -Why would she
do that? She's crazy about him!

15:14.090 --> 15:16.092
Niles, is your nose bleeding?

15:16.127 --> 15:19.890
No, no, I was just
admiring Cecil's handiwork.

15:21.830 --> 15:23.400
That was the mayor on
the phone. Apparently his wife...

15:23.435 --> 15:28.030
...can't make it tonight so
he has invited Senator Adler!

15:29.080 --> 15:32.580
-Can anything else possibly
go wrong? -Take a look at that.

15:34.280 --> 15:37.880
Oh, dear God.
Is that blood on my floor?

15:40.460 --> 15:42.860
And another drop.

15:47.770 --> 15:49.770
Niles!

15:55.380 --> 15:57.280
Well?

15:57.690 --> 15:59.405
Is it terribly wrong
to mislead someone...

15:59.440 --> 16:01.690
...even if it is for
his or her own good?

16:01.850 --> 16:04.150
What did you tell Daphne?

16:04.500 --> 16:07.090
I made up a story that
Joe seduces all the women...

16:07.125 --> 16:09.200
...he works for so she
wouldn't go out with him.

16:09.580 --> 16:12.980
Oh Niles, how could
you be so selfish?

16:13.160 --> 16:14.726
I didn't do it for me,
I did it for her.

16:14.761 --> 16:16.860
She deserves a doctor,
or a lawyer...

16:17.050 --> 16:20.650
...someone for whom a
T-shirt is an undergarment.

16:21.970 --> 16:24.000
Look, I don't know what
sort of twisted fantasy...

16:24.035 --> 16:26.170
...you've concocted about
you and Daphne. I suppose...

16:26.400 --> 16:27.848
...it involves a comet
hitting the earth...

16:27.883 --> 16:31.100
...and you and she having
to rebuild the species!

16:31.760 --> 16:34.960
But trust me, Niles,
it is not going to happen.

16:35.180 --> 16:37.261
She needs a man - one who
can do more for her than...

16:37.296 --> 16:40.380
...just smell her hair.

16:43.340 --> 16:46.840
-Daphne! -What are you going to do?
-You are going to fix this.

16:47.090 --> 16:49.590
-What am I going to tell her?
-Tell her the truth.

16:49.730 --> 16:53.230
Only the truth
shall make you clot.

16:56.690 --> 16:58.575
-Yes, Dr. Crane?
-Yes Daphne, er...

16:58.610 --> 17:01.390
Niles has something he
wishes to discuss with you.

17:01.870 --> 17:06.270
What is it, Dr. Crane? Oh look,
you have a spot on your tie.

17:08.790 --> 17:11.790
Well, earlier,
what I said about Joe...

17:12.310 --> 17:18.010
I made a mistake. He doesn't sleep
around, he hasn't wrecked any homes...

17:18.500 --> 17:20.700
...and the business
about Mimsie Stanshope...

17:21.900 --> 17:23.400
Oh sorry...

17:23.630 --> 17:26.730
...is there a john around
here to air out my paddle?

17:27.900 --> 17:30.200
You can use the master bedroom.

17:30.430 --> 17:33.830
-Joe never worked for Mimsie
Stanshoe.. -He sure didn't.

17:33.990 --> 17:38.290
I do all the work at Mimsie's.
She is one tough lady to satisfy.

17:38.560 --> 17:40.260
It's you?

17:40.490 --> 17:43.590
I'm the only guy that can make
her happy, everyone knows that.

17:44.500 --> 17:46.600
Jeez.

17:47.820 --> 17:50.364
So, that was the mistake you heard.

17:50.399 --> 17:53.320
Those stories you heard
weren't about Joe...

17:53.590 --> 17:55.990
They were about Bruce?

17:57.620 --> 18:00.220
Hard to believe, isn't it?

18:00.590 --> 18:05.490
But you know, when society women
go slumming they go all the way!

18:06.420 --> 18:09.580
So, you can tell Joe that
you've changed your mind...

18:09.615 --> 18:10.920
...about going out with him.

18:11.100 --> 18:14.800
-Oh no, I couldn't. What would
I say? -Just tell him the truth.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.900
Tell him that I heard stories
that he... No, bad idea! Here.

18:21.010 --> 18:23.610
You... wait here.

18:28.300 --> 18:30.700
-Joe.
-Yep?

18:33.430 --> 18:34.720
You have to ask
Daphne out again.

18:34.755 --> 18:37.630
-Are you nuts? You heard
what she said. -Yes...

18:37.790 --> 18:39.367
...but if you ask her again;
she'll say yes.

18:39.402 --> 18:42.190
Hey, maybe I've changed my mind.

18:42.420 --> 18:44.000
Oh no, you haven't changed your mind.

18:44.035 --> 18:46.720
You're just letting masculine
vanity and hurt feelings...

18:46.930 --> 18:49.705
...keep you from something that
other men can only dream of...

18:49.740 --> 18:51.730
...in their oxblood seated
leather wingback chair...

18:51.900 --> 18:54.200
...with the lights off.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.906
Look, Dr. Crane, I just don't
think it'll work out - okay?

18:58.941 --> 19:00.600
No, it's not okay.

19:01.830 --> 19:04.330
If you had ever...
smelt her hair...

19:04.500 --> 19:07.200
...you'd know she's worth
at least one more try.

19:07.380 --> 19:10.180
She is an angel,
and she is a goddess...

19:10.300 --> 19:13.400
...and she's waiting for
you in the bathroom.

19:25.930 --> 19:27.830
You got a minute?

19:41.680 --> 19:45.180
I'm never going to make it.
Daphne, would you please get that?

19:45.430 --> 19:46.831
Jeez, I thought you were
just going to slit your wrists.

19:46.866 --> 19:50.130
It looks like you went for
"death of a thousand cuts."

19:50.320 --> 19:51.995
I cut myself because I was
shaving without water.

19:52.030 --> 19:53.420
And why was there no water?

19:53.530 --> 19:54.556
Because I had to move your chair...

19:54.591 --> 19:56.330
...which gouged the floor,
which made me call for Joe...

19:56.490 --> 19:58.590
...who found bad pipes,
who called for Cecil...

19:58.790 --> 19:59.669
...who ate the cat
that killed the rat...

19:59.704 --> 20:02.990
...that lived in the house
that Frasier built!

20:06.120 --> 20:09.720
That was the doorman. Senator
Adler's limousine just pulled up.

20:09.890 --> 20:15.290
Oh, it's over, it's over.
Sing, fat lady, sing.

20:16.030 --> 20:17.200
Frasier, what are
we going to do?

20:17.235 --> 20:18.785
Will you give me your cash?
Both of you, come on!

20:18.820 --> 20:19.230
-Hurry up!
-Why?

20:19.420 --> 20:20.724
Never mind why,
just hand it to me.

20:20.759 --> 20:21.820
Come on, be quick, Niles.

20:22.020 --> 20:23.441
Oh all right, do you want all
seven hundred dollars?

20:23.476 --> 20:25.720
You carry seven hundred
dollars in your wallet?

20:25.920 --> 20:29.020
Well, Maris asked me to
stop by the drugstore later.

20:29.930 --> 20:31.930
Just hand it over.

20:32.600 --> 20:35.900
Okay, guys. I've got seven hundred
and some odd dollars here.

20:36.140 --> 20:38.521
If you can get everything cleared up
before Frasier's buddies get here...

20:38.556 --> 20:40.440
...it's yours to split any way
you want on your way out.

20:40.630 --> 20:43.530
Bribery? That's your big plan?

20:47.520 --> 20:50.081
Oh my God, it's starting to work!

20:50.116 --> 20:53.020
Hey, here's another hundred I was
holding out on my old man!

20:58.500 --> 21:02.700
-Dr. Crane. -Yes?
-Joe told me what you did.

21:03.020 --> 21:05.108
I think that's the
nicest thing anyone's...

21:05.143 --> 21:07.520
...ever done for me. Thank you.

21:09.530 --> 21:12.730
-Did you feel that? We made a spark.
-Oh yes, we did.

21:12.920 --> 21:16.520
I guess you were right, it is just the
carpet!

21:18.130 --> 21:21.330
Okay everybody, come on. Move it,
move it, move it. We're out of here.

21:22.240 --> 21:25.540
-Are you ready?
-Good night.

21:26.450 --> 21:28.350
Goodnight Daphne,
have a good time.

21:30.160 --> 21:33.360
Oh, my God, we did it,
we actually did it.

21:33.640 --> 21:36.540
Oh dad, please don't leave,
I'd like you to stay.

21:36.690 --> 21:38.622
I mean, you helped me to get
this put together tonight.

21:38.657 --> 21:40.990
Oh well, thanks Fras.
That makes me feel good.

21:41.190 --> 21:42.713
Not good enough to
hang around that...

21:42.748 --> 21:46.190
...bleeding-heart-softie-on-crime
Senator Adler, but good.

21:46.750 --> 21:49.650
Come on Eddie, the
politicians are coming!

21:52.570 --> 21:54.470
They're here.

21:57.440 --> 22:02.140
Senator Adler, Mayor -
welcome to my humble abode.

22:02.340 --> 22:05.540
You know you're out
of T.P. in the can?
