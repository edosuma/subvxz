WEBVTT

00:00.875 --> 00:04.000
Alex, get ready!
Justin and Zeke are coming.

00:04.000 --> 00:07.875
Ever since Zeke found out about
magic he's been so annoying.

00:07.875 --> 00:09.750
Aww. Now, that's love.

00:09.750 --> 00:12.000
You think he just
became annoying.

00:14.458 --> 00:17.750
Zeke, I just told you.
Sometimes we use our wands,

00:17.750 --> 00:19.833
but sometimes we just
wave our hands around.

00:19.833 --> 00:21.583
Why is that so hard
to understand?

00:21.583 --> 00:25.458
Gosh, I love how
wizardry plays by its own rules!

00:25.458 --> 00:29.958
OK, is there, like,
a special gland in your
body that secretes magic?

00:29.958 --> 00:32.375
And sometimes it gets
all clogged up,
and you have to pop it,

00:32.375 --> 00:34.875
and magic goes everywhere?

00:34.875 --> 00:38.083
Eww. All right, I'm upstairs
if anyone needs me.

00:38.083 --> 00:42.250
Ooh, I wonder if "upstairs"
is code for somewhere wizard-y.

00:42.250 --> 00:43.625
It isn't.

00:43.625 --> 00:47.416
Oh, I wonder if "it isn't"
is code for something wizard-y.

00:47.416 --> 00:48.750
It is.

00:48.750 --> 00:51.333
I knew it!

00:52.625 --> 00:55.583
Zeke, you have to try
to be more like Harper

00:55.583 --> 00:57.250
when she found out
about wizards.

00:57.250 --> 00:59.458
OK? She didn't have
a hard time with it at all.

00:59.458 --> 01:02.583
That's true, but to be fair,
my circus-like childhood

01:02.583 --> 01:05.875
makes the most bizarre things
seem normal.

01:05.875 --> 01:09.000
I'm sorry, Justin. It's just
that I have so many questions.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.875
For example, can you cook a hot
dog by sticking it on a wand?

01:11.875 --> 01:15.291
- Zeke!
- Can you use magic to turn me
into an alien dog named Kevin?

01:15.291 --> 01:17.708
- Zeke!
- Can you use magic
to fix the hair

01:17.708 --> 01:19.416
that sticks up
on the back of my head?

01:19.416 --> 01:22.125
- Oh, wait, we're good today.
- Zeke, enough!

01:22.125 --> 01:24.750
I'll make you a deal.
If you stop bothering me

01:24.750 --> 01:27.291
with all of these
ridiculous questions,

01:27.291 --> 01:30.166
then I will grant you
one magic wish.

01:30.166 --> 01:31.875
- Really?
- Yes.

01:31.875 --> 01:35.208
OK, then I want to go
back in time into last week,

01:35.208 --> 01:37.375
when I bought this shirt,
to get a green one instead.

01:37.375 --> 01:40.375
- Sounds good.
- Whoo! Yes!

01:40.375 --> 01:44.083
Oh, can you use magic to make me
blow bubbles out of my...?

01:52.833 --> 01:55.000

02:37.458 --> 02:40.166
OK, Mom. Talia and I are
gonna go to the movies.

02:40.166 --> 02:41.708
Oh, really?
What are you guys gonna see?

02:41.708 --> 02:44.000
A love story called
Heart of Flowers.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.083
It's about two people
who appear on the surface
to be totally mismatched,

02:47.083 --> 02:50.000
only to find out in the end
they're perfect for one another.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.500
It really speaks to us.

02:53.583 --> 02:56.458
Listen, honey, I'm so sorry,
but Max can't go.

02:56.458 --> 02:57.708
He's got chores to do.

02:57.708 --> 02:59.416
But, Mom, I could just...

02:59.416 --> 03:02.458
Shh, it's a chick flick.
I'm trying to get you out of it.

03:04.708 --> 03:07.291
I know, and it promises
to be very romantic,

03:07.291 --> 03:10.333
which is perfect,
because I love romantic things.

03:11.291 --> 03:14.416
Really?

03:14.416 --> 03:16.375
Sweetie, what is going on?

03:16.375 --> 03:18.708
You and Talia
have nothing in common.

03:18.708 --> 03:21.000
Mom, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.500
Come on, Talia.
We have to stop

03:22.500 --> 03:24.250
and get tissues
for when we cry at the end.

03:24.250 --> 03:27.625
The big ones, 'cause I'm feeling
very fragile these days.

03:29.833 --> 03:32.333
You have raised
a wonderful son, Mrs. Russo.

03:32.333 --> 03:35.958
Yeah. And when you see him,
can you send him home?

03:43.958 --> 03:46.958
Dad, Dad! Look who
just walked in here!

03:46.958 --> 03:49.875
That's Muy Macho. That's, like,
my favorite Lucha wrestler
of all time.

03:49.875 --> 03:54.125
Hey, you're right!
He's one of your biggest heroes.

03:55.750 --> 03:58.583
Get him to sign some of
these cups, and we'll sell 'em.

04:01.583 --> 04:03.458
Oh, I shouldn't!

04:07.333 --> 04:10.375
Hi, excuse me.
You're Muy Macho, aren't you?

04:10.375 --> 04:13.458
- I'm, like, one of
your biggest fans ever.
- Oh, well, thank you!

04:13.458 --> 04:16.208
But you know, nobody really
calls me Muy Macho anymore.

04:16.208 --> 04:20.250
What do they call you now?
El Destroyer-o?

04:20.250 --> 04:23.708
Or, Muy Bone-Crusher-o?

04:25.458 --> 04:27.583
Obviously,
I don't speak Spanish.

04:27.583 --> 04:29.875
No, you don't. No.

04:29.875 --> 04:33.458
They call me Bob.
That's my name. Bob Macho.

04:33.458 --> 04:36.000
I now own a successful
shoe store.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.125
Maybe you've
heard about it:

04:37.125 --> 04:40.000
"Bob Macho's
Successful Shoe Store."

04:41.291 --> 04:42.958
What? No, no, no.

04:42.958 --> 04:45.375
You can't be a boring
shoe salesman.

04:45.375 --> 04:48.000
You're one of the meanest,
toughest Luchadores of all time.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.833
I mean, I remember when you
made Chimi the Changa eat
his own beard.

04:50.833 --> 04:53.625
That was the old me.

04:53.625 --> 04:57.583
I've given all that up
to be a more peaceful,
constructive citizen.

04:57.583 --> 05:00.333
Why would you do that?

05:00.333 --> 05:03.458
Well, because of what
happened to me ten years ago.

05:03.458 --> 05:06.083
Right in the middle of a match,
I slipped on a churro

05:06.083 --> 05:09.583
and I fell into the front
row of the crowd, where
a little girl unmasked me.

05:09.583 --> 05:11.625
It was the only fight
I ever lost,

05:11.625 --> 05:14.291
and the most disgraceful
moment of my career.

05:14.291 --> 05:15.708
Eh, so I retired.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.458
Could you excuse me
for one second?

05:21.625 --> 05:24.333
- I can't believe this.
- Me neither.

05:24.333 --> 05:26.000
I mean, what kind
of careless parent

05:26.000 --> 05:29.583
lets his little girl
go to a wrestling match?

05:29.583 --> 05:31.583
Dad, that careless
parent was you,

05:31.583 --> 05:33.875
and that little girl was me.

05:33.875 --> 05:36.166
Don't you remember?

05:44.250 --> 05:45.875
Yeah!

05:45.875 --> 05:48.750
Get him! Ooh, ooh!
My churro!

05:58.000 --> 05:59.458
Ay, no!

06:06.583 --> 06:09.333
Wow. And, to think,
all these years,

06:09.333 --> 06:11.708
I've remembered that day
as the time

06:11.708 --> 06:13.875
when I let a perfectly
good churro get away.

06:16.416 --> 06:18.875
Look, Mr. Macho,
I'm so sorry

06:18.875 --> 06:21.125
that that little girl robbed you
of your true calling.

06:21.125 --> 06:23.250
Oh, you don't
have to apologize.

06:23.250 --> 06:24.583
I love my job.

06:24.583 --> 06:28.125
Every time I fit someone's feet,
I make ten new friends.

06:30.875 --> 06:32.250
Yeah, OK, look.

06:32.250 --> 06:35.000
I know that you don't know me,
that we just met,

06:35.000 --> 06:37.833
and I know you say you're
happy, but I think I know
what's best for you.

06:37.833 --> 06:41.000
So, how would you like
another shot at wrestling?

06:41.000 --> 06:43.291
- Well, I...
- Alex, what are you doing?

06:43.291 --> 06:46.875
Dad, Muy Macho lost everything
because of me.

06:46.875 --> 06:48.458
I have to make it up to him.

06:48.458 --> 06:51.291
So... Mr. Macho,
what do you say?

06:51.291 --> 06:54.833
Do you want to taste
victory again?

06:54.833 --> 06:59.750
Well... Well, I...
I guess it could be fun.

06:59.750 --> 07:03.458
Although who would get
into the ring with an old
washed-up wrestler like me?

07:03.458 --> 07:06.416
- No, no, my dad will do it.
- He will?

07:06.416 --> 07:09.958
Yes. Because he knows how much
it means to his only daughter.

07:10.833 --> 07:12.458
No!

07:14.500 --> 07:17.583
- I'll buy you a churro.
- OK, I'll do it.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.416
Great! Then it's settled.
The mighty Muy Macho

07:22.416 --> 07:26.291
will return to the ring,
so that he can erase
the awful shame

07:26.291 --> 07:29.083
that has been haunting him
for the past ten years.

07:29.083 --> 07:31.125
- What? I'm not ashamed...
- No...

07:33.458 --> 07:35.583
...need to thank me.

07:37.583 --> 07:39.625
It's just the kind of
special person that I am.

07:39.625 --> 07:42.416
Mmm. I hope I can find
my Lucha mask.

07:42.416 --> 07:45.000
- My dog's been
wearing it as pants.
- Ah.

07:49.250 --> 07:51.000
Great news, Mom.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.875
Dad is gonna get in the ring
with a famous Luchador.

07:53.875 --> 07:56.083
What? Jerry!

07:56.083 --> 07:57.625
I go to the kitchen
for five minutes

07:57.625 --> 08:00.291
and you arrange a fight
with a professional wrestler?

08:00.291 --> 08:02.583
You lose your breath while
cheering for wrestling.

08:02.583 --> 08:06.000
You can be
the beautiful ring girl.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.958
Really? You'll be fine, Jerry.

08:20.291 --> 08:21.500
Harper, there you are.

08:21.500 --> 08:24.375
Zeke, what are you doing here?
You already graduated.

08:24.375 --> 08:26.625
I got a job as a crossing guard
so I could be close to you

08:26.625 --> 08:28.708
in case I freaked out
and needed to talk.

08:28.708 --> 08:31.083
Let me guess,
you're freaking out.

08:31.083 --> 08:32.125
Yes!

08:33.958 --> 08:36.000
It's this magic wish
that Justin's giving me.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.291
I don't know what to wish for!

08:37.291 --> 08:39.125
Like, what if I wish
to live forever,

08:39.125 --> 08:41.125
but then fall into
a dried-up well

08:41.125 --> 08:42.375
and no one knows
where to find me?

08:42.375 --> 08:44.083
I can't live in a dried-up well
forever, Harper!

08:44.083 --> 08:45.875
I just can't!

08:48.958 --> 08:51.625
Maybe you should wish for
a less active imagination.

08:53.583 --> 08:55.166
Attention please.

08:55.166 --> 08:57.458
There's just been
a traffic accident outside.

08:57.458 --> 08:59.333
Unacceptable!

08:59.333 --> 09:01.250
Apparently the crossing guard
left his post.

09:01.250 --> 09:03.500
Honey, now you should
be freaking out.

09:11.458 --> 09:13.333
You know,
maybe Zeke's right.

09:13.333 --> 09:16.291
Having a wish would be a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

09:16.291 --> 09:17.958
How come you never
gave me one of those?

09:17.958 --> 09:19.458
Because you hate it
when I do magic.

09:19.458 --> 09:21.958
Yeah, but that's because
I never had the opportunity

09:21.958 --> 09:25.250
- to use it selfishly.
- Selfish?

09:25.250 --> 09:28.083
Aww, I'm such a good
role model for you.

09:29.375 --> 09:31.416
All right.
You can have one wish.

09:31.416 --> 09:34.375
Oh, my gosh, really?
Oh, I wish I had more time
to think of a good wish.

09:34.375 --> 09:35.625
No! That's not my wish!

09:36.875 --> 09:40.375
I really need to think
about this. Wish me luck.

09:40.375 --> 09:42.083
No, no, no!
That's not it either!

09:43.291 --> 09:45.708
Oh! Oh! No, no, no.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.708
You look really
nice today, Max.

09:49.708 --> 09:52.166
I'm so glad I told you
to wear that suit.

09:52.166 --> 09:53.875
I agree.

09:55.333 --> 09:57.708
You know, Talia, I don't know
what my mom was talking about

09:57.708 --> 09:59.416
when she said we didn't
have anything in common.

09:59.416 --> 10:02.375
I know. We have tons
of things in common.

10:02.375 --> 10:04.833
- Our love of opera music.
- Yes.

10:04.833 --> 10:08.083
- Brussel sprouts.
- Yum!

10:08.083 --> 10:10.333
Architectural walking tours.

10:11.083 --> 10:12.458
Yay.

10:15.291 --> 10:18.291
You like whatever I like.
It's why we work.

10:19.375 --> 10:21.166
How do we feel
about video games?

10:21.166 --> 10:22.958
Oh, we frown upon them.

10:24.583 --> 10:26.291
I was afraid we
would say that.

10:32.958 --> 10:37.583
I'm looking for the man
they call Jerry Russo!

10:39.166 --> 10:41.000
Hey, look, everybody,
it's Bob!

10:41.000 --> 10:42.583
What a great costume!

10:42.583 --> 10:44.875
Stick a roll in it,
sandwich maker!

10:44.875 --> 10:46.750
The name is Muy Macho!

10:46.750 --> 10:48.750
Alex, you were right.

10:48.750 --> 10:53.458
Apparently, I'm not happy
being the owner of a very
successful shoe store.

10:53.458 --> 10:56.458
I am, and always have been,
a perfectly chiseled

10:56.458 --> 10:59.416
fighting machine with no
conscience whatsoever!

11:00.625 --> 11:04.000
- Muy Macho is back!
- That's right!

11:04.000 --> 11:07.875
In the ring,
reducing grown men

11:07.875 --> 11:10.708
to sniveling shells
of their former selves!

11:18.458 --> 11:22.083
OK, just so you know,
that means he's really angry.

11:25.500 --> 11:28.166
He just tore
a phone book in half!

11:28.166 --> 11:31.000
I am not fighting him!
I could get hurt.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.583
Dad, Dad, if you don't
fight him, he can't win.

11:34.583 --> 11:36.250
How am I gonna make up
for what I did to him?

11:36.250 --> 11:37.458
But...

11:39.583 --> 11:42.583
I will fight Muy Macho!

11:46.708 --> 11:49.500
Zeke, what in the world
are you talking about?

11:49.500 --> 11:52.083
I'm talking about fulfilling
a lifelong dream of mine:

11:52.083 --> 11:53.291
to fight a Mexican wrestler.

11:53.291 --> 11:55.750
I also had one to become
a professional magician,

11:55.750 --> 11:58.125
but we all know
how that turned out.

11:59.833 --> 12:02.708
I will see you
in the ring, kid.

12:02.708 --> 12:06.291
Where I will make you hurt
worse than a bunion

12:06.291 --> 12:10.500
that has resulted
from ill-fitting shoes!

12:23.416 --> 12:25.125
You sure you know
what you're doing, buddy?

12:25.125 --> 12:27.958
Yes, yes, he's sure.
He said it, right?
Thank you, Zeke.

12:27.958 --> 12:29.875
OK? The match
will go on as planned.

12:29.875 --> 12:32.458
Dad, don't worry,
it'll be all good.

12:32.458 --> 12:35.458
'Cause see, Muy Macho
will beat Zeke,
my conscience will be clear,

12:35.458 --> 12:37.291
and I can get rid of this
haunting flashback.

12:38.833 --> 12:40.458
No, stop it!

12:42.125 --> 12:44.458
I've decided on my wish.

12:44.458 --> 12:47.583
I want you to make me
a great Luchador.

12:47.583 --> 12:49.875
That nice man with
the heavy accent

12:49.875 --> 12:52.458
will regret ever
coming out of retirement!

12:52.458 --> 12:55.083
Why are you
talking like that?

12:55.083 --> 12:57.875
This is my wrestler voice!

12:57.875 --> 12:59.625
I thought it was obvious.

13:01.291 --> 13:03.000
Oh, jeez!

13:06.208 --> 13:07.375
I don't know
about this, Zeke.

13:07.375 --> 13:09.500
Fighting Muy Macho
could be dangerous.

13:09.500 --> 13:12.583
Not with magic.
I can't lose.

13:12.583 --> 13:15.166
Plus, I already got my cool
wrestling name all picked out:

13:15.166 --> 13:18.833
Lava Sus Manos!

13:20.166 --> 13:21.625
That means
"wash your hands."

13:23.500 --> 13:25.125
Oh, that makes sense.

13:25.125 --> 13:27.416
I read it on a sign
in the men's bathroom.

13:28.583 --> 13:32.125
All right. If that is your wish,
then you got it.

13:32.125 --> 13:34.208
Whoo! Thank you, my friend!

13:54.583 --> 13:56.708
Hey, guys!

13:56.708 --> 13:59.250
Are you coming to
the Lucha match tonight?

13:59.250 --> 14:00.875
I don't know if you've heard,
but there's gonna be like

14:00.875 --> 14:03.333
a really beautiful
ring girl there.

14:03.333 --> 14:05.416
Oh, no way,
I love Lucha wrestling!

14:05.416 --> 14:08.000
- I know.
- No, you don't, Max.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.458
It's barbaric.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.583
You're right, I never
thought of it that way.

14:14.583 --> 14:16.583
It's barbaric.

14:18.375 --> 14:20.583
As you can tell,
Mrs. Russo,

14:20.583 --> 14:22.458
Max and I are
into cute things,

14:22.458 --> 14:24.750
like making a snowman
out of cotton balls

14:24.750 --> 14:26.833
and dressing up kittens
to look like famous people.

14:26.833 --> 14:30.166
- Uh-huh.
- Really?

14:30.166 --> 14:34.875
That doesn't
sound like you, Max.

14:34.875 --> 14:36.333
Is it true?

14:39.375 --> 14:41.833
No. No, it's not true.

14:42.750 --> 14:44.458
You know what?

14:44.458 --> 14:47.416
Talia, I can't
do this anymore.

14:47.416 --> 14:51.250
I don't like chick flicks
and I don't like opera music.

14:51.250 --> 14:55.083
And I only like dressing up
kittens in little dog costumes.

14:56.583 --> 14:58.208
What are you saying?

14:59.458 --> 15:02.291
I'm saying
my mom was right.

15:02.291 --> 15:05.625
We have nothing
in common... whatsoever.

15:07.333 --> 15:09.333
We should probably break up.

15:09.333 --> 15:12.208
In fact, you should probably
leave before you catch
a glimpse of the real me,

15:12.208 --> 15:14.583
because it's super gross.

15:25.583 --> 15:28.333
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen,

15:28.333 --> 15:31.083
and welcome to tonight's
main event!

15:31.083 --> 15:34.625
Making his triumphant
return to the ring,

15:34.625 --> 15:40.250
we have the legendary
Luchador, Muy Macho!

15:48.875 --> 15:51.125
Alex, it is not
in my character

15:51.125 --> 15:53.125
to offer you
a heartfelt thanks

15:53.125 --> 15:54.750
for giving me
this second chance.

15:54.750 --> 15:58.583
So, I will simply say...
I will not destroy you!

15:59.708 --> 16:02.875
Aww. That's what makes
this all worthwhile.

16:04.708 --> 16:09.208
And in this corner,
wearing a chicken costume

16:09.208 --> 16:11.000
that doesn't match his name,

16:11.000 --> 16:17.416
we have the challenger,
Lava Sus Manos!

16:23.708 --> 16:26.875
Are you ready
for some Lucha wrestling?

16:32.458 --> 16:35.708
All right, Zeke,
this is your one wish.

16:35.708 --> 16:38.708
Let's... make the best of it.

16:39.875 --> 16:43.583
Lucha Ba Boom!

16:43.583 --> 16:45.416
Well? How do you feel?

16:45.416 --> 16:49.708
I feel like Lava Sus Manos is
about to get his hands dirty!

16:50.583 --> 16:51.708
That's great.

17:11.708 --> 17:15.083
Justin, what's going on
with Zeke? Why is he winning?

17:15.083 --> 17:17.875
I put a spell on him to make him
a wrestler. That was his wish.

17:17.875 --> 17:19.416
What?!

17:19.416 --> 17:22.416
Smell your own foot,
shoe salesman!

17:24.708 --> 17:28.458
Why did you convince me
to do this, Alex?

17:28.458 --> 17:30.208
This is even
more humiliating

17:30.208 --> 17:32.333
than being unmasked
by a little girl!

17:35.708 --> 17:37.000
Don't worry, Muy Macho!

17:37.000 --> 17:38.458
I'm not gonna let you
lose again!

17:41.416 --> 17:43.416
Lucha Ba Boom.
But stronger!

17:46.708 --> 17:49.000
Oh...

18:03.833 --> 18:07.000
Justin?
What's going on?!

18:09.416 --> 18:12.125
I guess you should have asked
to be an unbeatable Luchador.

18:12.125 --> 18:14.208
Magic is very
specific like that.

18:14.208 --> 18:16.458
Just...
Just get out of there!

18:16.458 --> 18:18.583
I can't!
I need another wish!

18:18.583 --> 18:20.833
All I can give you is advice.

18:20.833 --> 18:23.500
Don't fight! Go limp!
Go limp! It works for me!

18:29.083 --> 18:30.583
Hey, this is great, huh?

18:34.458 --> 18:35.458
Talia?

18:35.458 --> 18:37.833
What are you doing here?

18:37.833 --> 18:40.458
I came to apologize
for the way I was treating you.

18:40.458 --> 18:43.958
And try to experience something
you actually like for once.

18:43.958 --> 18:45.708
I'm having a lot of fun.

18:45.708 --> 18:48.625
This is just like that
chick flick,Heart of Flowers.

18:48.625 --> 18:52.000
I'm the sloppy maid and
you're the stuffy rich guy.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.166
In the end, we learn
to appreciate each
other's differences

18:54.166 --> 18:57.458
and live the rest of our lives
together in an old beach house.

18:57.458 --> 19:00.208
I'll always be
your stuffy rich guy, Max.

19:00.875 --> 19:02.083
Aww.

19:06.125 --> 19:08.000
Oh, help!

19:08.000 --> 19:10.291
Come on, Muy Macho!
Take him down!

19:11.833 --> 19:14.500
Oh, my gosh, Alex! I've finally
figured out my one wish!

19:14.500 --> 19:18.125
World peace!
Pretty good, huh?

19:18.125 --> 19:20.125
Yeah, yeah, Harper.
That's great, OK?
Here you go.

19:20.125 --> 19:23.458
Mommy!

19:23.458 --> 19:25.000
Oh, my gosh,
Zeke's in trouble.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.500
Alex, you have to help him.

19:26.500 --> 19:29.000
I can't help him.
Muy Macho has to win.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
Why does Muy Macho
have to win?

19:31.000 --> 19:33.500
It's a long story.
Maybe this flashback
will help you understand.

19:40.333 --> 19:41.875
Ay, no!

19:47.875 --> 19:50.000
You can show people
your flashbacks?

19:50.000 --> 19:51.416
Yeah, I find it's
quicker that way.

19:51.416 --> 19:52.833
Wasn't I cute back then?

19:52.833 --> 19:54.708
All right,
I see your problem.

19:54.708 --> 19:57.583
But that doesn't change
the fact that Zeke is
getting destroyed up there.

19:57.583 --> 20:00.875
Ow! Going limp
makes it worse!

20:02.625 --> 20:04.583
If you're not gonna help,
I want to change my wish.

20:04.583 --> 20:07.166
Forget world peace.
I want to beat
Muy Macho senseless

20:07.166 --> 20:08.875
for hurting my man.

20:08.875 --> 20:12.458
Harper, really? I mean...
Really, do you want to do that?

20:12.458 --> 20:14.333
World peace kinda
sounds awesome.

20:14.333 --> 20:16.708
That is my wish!
Do it now!

20:19.416 --> 20:20.708
OK.

20:20.708 --> 20:23.583
Sorry, Muy Macho.

20:23.583 --> 20:25.333
Lucha Ba Boom,
Muy Macho's doomed.

20:26.958 --> 20:29.625
- I'm coming, Zeke!
- Hurry!

20:46.750 --> 20:48.250
One, two, three!

20:48.250 --> 20:50.583
We have a winner!

21:00.083 --> 21:01.750
And what's your
wrestling name?

21:01.750 --> 21:05.125
Whatever the Spanish word is
for "crazy, red-headed chick!"

21:07.000 --> 21:08.625
I can't be certain, Jerry,

21:08.625 --> 21:11.208
but I think all these people
are cheering for me.

21:20.750 --> 21:23.083
Oh, my gosh,
I'm so sorry, Muy Macho.

21:23.083 --> 21:26.875
- I can't believe
this happened again.
- I know. I'm terrible.

21:26.875 --> 21:30.708
That scrawny kid
and that girl beat me.

21:30.708 --> 21:34.083
I obviously have no business
being a wrestler.

21:34.083 --> 21:36.416
No, I think you should
try again. I think you
can take that girl.

21:36.416 --> 21:40.708
No, Alex, I realized
that I am perfectly happy

21:40.708 --> 21:42.458
being a successful
shoe salesman.

21:43.875 --> 21:47.250
- So you're saying
I actually helped you?
- No!

21:47.250 --> 21:49.416
This was the worst
experience of my life!

21:49.416 --> 21:52.833
I'll never forgive you,
Alex Russo. Never!

21:58.333 --> 22:02.000
Well...
You did what you could.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.833
You had the best intentions.
Just forget about it.

22:10.875 --> 22:13.375
This was the worst
experience of my life!

22:13.375 --> 22:16.375
I'll never forgive you,
Alex Russo. Never!

22:20.708 --> 22:23.291
Great. A new flashback.

22:23.291 --> 22:25.375
Ay, no!
