We're just trying
to corroborate what
our source told us.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.699
We know nothing
about this man.
LIZ: Bhavish Ratna...

10:46.740 --> 10:50.301
Married, bought the restaurant
23 years ago with his wife.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.875
Taxes paid,
not once late on rent.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.945
All we know
about his alleged
criminal activity

10:54.980 --> 10:56.618
is what Reddington told us.
Hang on, wait.

10:56.650 --> 10:59.141
Reddington told us
that the world's largest
underground bank

10:59.190 --> 11:01.454
is also serving the best
lunch buffet in Manhattan,

11:01.490 --> 11:03.151
and that's not enough
for you?

11:03.190 --> 11:05.158
I'm only saying
we have protocol.
I'm not comfortable

11:05.190 --> 11:07.021
trusting what Reddington
told us about this.

11:11.030 --> 11:12.895

delivery guy again.

11:12.940 --> 11:14.362
Wait, is that him?

11:14.400 --> 11:16.903
LIZ: That's him... Ratna.

11:16.940 --> 11:19.261
Okay, that's odd.
Why is the owner
making a delivery

11:19.310 --> 11:20.937
when he's had the kid
running deliveries all day?

11:20.980 --> 11:22.800
RESSLER: I don't know,
but ifI find cash
in those bags

11:22.850 --> 11:24.738
instead of vindaloo,
would it make you
feel any better

11:24.780 --> 11:25.872
about arresting
the guy?

11:28.720 --> 11:30.984
He's not taking the bike.
He's walking from here.

11:31.020 --> 11:32.851
All right, Keen,
you and Park flank him.

11:32.890 --> 11:35.609
I'll take his six.
Let's just keep an eye on him,

11:35.660 --> 11:37.423
see where he's going.

11:37.460 --> 11:39.553

11:44.230 --> 11:45.367
Keen, you got eyes?

11:45.400 --> 11:47.197
Copy that.
I have eyes.

11:49.700 --> 11:51.008
He can't be going far
on foot.

11:51.040 --> 11:52.359
Which means
if he's doing a drop,

11:52.410 --> 11:53.809
the target's
got to be close.

11:55.740 --> 11:58.004

we have a situation here.

12:01.920 --> 12:03.182

worker behind Ratna...

12:12.030 --> 12:13.497
He's on radio.

12:13.530 --> 12:15.896
I don't like this.
He's got protection.

12:22.240 --> 12:23.537
We should call
for support.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.274

Is that you?

12:38.250 --> 12:39.512
You are, uh...

12:39.550 --> 12:40.983
Ressler,
what's going on?

12:41.020 --> 12:42.317
I don't know.
Could be the target.

12:42.360 --> 12:43.759
Park, you have eyes?
No, nothing.

12:43.790 --> 12:46.054
Too many people.

12:46.090 --> 12:48.797

And you're Bhavish Ratna.

12:48.830 --> 12:50.024
Now we're friends.

12:50.070 --> 12:51.423
He's talking to someone.

12:51.470 --> 12:53.893
Can't see_his face.
He's wearing a hat.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.339
You got to
be kidding me.

12:55.370 --> 12:57.736

No, that's not possible.
It's Reddington.

12:59.610 --> 13:02.431
I'm here as something
of a guardian angel,
Bhavish.

13:02.480 --> 13:06.541
It's come to my attention
that you're the target
of an FBI investigation.

13:08.220 --> 13:10.017
That can't be.
And yet it is.

13:10.050 --> 13:12.245
Keen, you want to
tell me what the hell
he's d0ing here?

13:12.290 --> 13:14.110
Wait, is Reddington here
with us or the target?

13:14.160 --> 13:15.582
He's not with us.

13:15.620 --> 13:18.987

furtive ginger
behind you?

13:19.030 --> 13:20.759
He's FBI.
Or if he isn't,

13:20.800 --> 13:23.291
he certainly looks
like he's FBI.

13:23.330 --> 13:25.594
Same with the woman
by the fence over there.

13:27.500 --> 13:29.388
And why are you
telling me all this?

13:29.440 --> 13:31.704
Because there's something
I want you to tell me,

13:31.740 --> 13:34.402
just as soon as I get you
the hell out of here.

13:34.440 --> 13:36.908
See the gentleman behind me,
by the black Mercedes?

13:36.950 --> 13:38.406
He's your escape plan.

13:38.450 --> 13:39.974
How do you want
to handle this, Keen?

13:40.020 --> 13:42.409
I don't know.
He's got security everywhere.

13:42.450 --> 13:44.145
Say the word,
and we're gone.

you want to know about,

16:04.530 --> 16:06.350

you hesitated when
you shouldn't have.

No, and I have to admit,
I'm not getting much closer,

33:21.600 --> 33:24.319
which is a problem, 'cause
it's almost casino night.

33:24.370 --> 33:26.099

everything set

33:26.130 --> 33:27.666
when Jerry gets here
with the sherbet,

a real problem.

This thing we do,
this whole dynamic?

33:54.560 --> 33:57.791
relentless nonsense,
your insipid banter?

33:57.830 --> 33:59.468
I tolerate it.

34:00.670 --> 34:02.194
But don't lose Sight
of the fact

34:02.240 --> 34:04.367
that this is a business
relationship.

34:04.410 --> 34:06.366
You're a finder.

34:06.410 --> 34:09.834
You exist _to me_
because you find things.

34:09.880 --> 34:12.269
Are you telling me
that you can't find

34:12.310 --> 34:13.345
what I need you to find?

34:13.380 --> 34:14.870
Because if that's the case,

34:14.920 --> 34:16.979
I will end this right now.

34:18.090 --> 34:20.684
And don't think I won't
because we have a history.

Helping Reddington? Dead?

Could be either...or both.

What are we
getting involved in?

35:27.950 --> 35:28.985
I don't follow.

35:29.020 --> 35:30.180
Reddington wanted Ratna.

35:30.220 --> 35:32.279
Said he needed him,
that he was critical

35:32.330 --> 35:34.252
to finding whoever
abducted him in Paris.

35:35.660 --> 35:37.457
But I have a feeling
this is about more than Paris.

35:38.130 --> 35:39.392
What are you suggesting?

35:40.270 --> 35:42.363
That Reddington's
in over his head,

35:42.400 --> 35:44.265
that he's scared,

35:44.310 --> 35:46.733
that he has his back
up against the wall.

35:46.770 --> 35:49.477
About what?
I have no idea.

35:49.510 --> 35:52.172

I have a Sinking feeling

35:52.210 --> 35:54.417
this thing is gonna get worse
before it gets better.

35:55.650 --> 35:57.117
And whatever
he's up against...

35:59.190 --> 36:01.146

on our doorstep.

something...

36:13.970 --> 36:17.599
About the, uh...
The picture you
drew today?

36:17.640 --> 36:20.438
Yeah.

Oh. Fantastic.

Thank you
for understanding.

I hope Agnes
got along Okay.

37:20.330 --> 37:21.866
Not at all.

Is she asleep?

37:23.900 --> 37:25.401
I can come to your place.

37:25.440 --> 37:26.759
Great. Okay.

37:30.110 --> 37:33.170
KATARINA: I can't imagine what
she could have possibly seen,

37:33.210 --> 37:35.144
but surely
it wasn't a body.

37:35.180 --> 37:37.171
Not... Not with me,
in the park.

37:38.450 --> 37:40.213
She wouldn't just
make that up.

37:40.250 --> 37:42.013
No, of course not.

37:42.060 --> 37:45.587
But like all children, Agnes
does have a vivid imagination.

37:46.490 --> 37:48.754
SO, she didn't say
anything to you?

37:48.800 --> 37:50.051
Nothing at all?

37:51.630 --> 37:53.097
Can I be completely
honest with you?

37:53.800 --> 37:55.097
No more secrets?

37:55.140 --> 37:57.335
Uh, I didn't realize
we had secrets.

Well, what does that
have to do with...

38:12.920 --> 38:17.050
Do you think perhaps Agnes...
That this body

38:17.090 --> 38:19.729
is her way of saying
that what you do scares her?

38:19.760 --> 38:22.194
What I do does scare her,
and we talk about that.

38:22.230 --> 38:25.791
And you and I
have talked about
her love Of fairy tales

38:25.830 --> 38:28.094
and how the violence
in those stories

38:28.130 --> 38:30.269
help deflect
what's going on in her mind.
