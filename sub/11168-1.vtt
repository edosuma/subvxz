23:46.157 --> 23:49.206
Joe Tex. The Four Tops.
Stevie Wonder.

23:49.327 --> 23:51.170
He was only 11. A pup.

23:51.412 --> 23:52.413
Wilson Pickett...

23:52.539 --> 23:53.756
Why are ya in Dublin?

23:53.915 --> 23:56.794
I'm tired of the road.
And me mammy isn't very well.

23:57.460 --> 23:58.928
Why would ya want to join us?

23:59.212 --> 24:00.805
The Lord sent me

24:00.880 --> 24:02.848
and the Lord blows my trumpet.

24:12.767 --> 24:13.939
What did Evel Knievel want?

24:14.018 --> 24:15.565
- God sent him.
- What?

24:15.645 --> 24:16.862
God sent him.

24:16.938 --> 24:18.406
On a fuckin' Suzuki?

24:53.391 --> 24:54.517
Jesus!

24:54.642 --> 24:56.440
He can play. That's for sure.

24:56.686 --> 24:58.688
The Lord doesn't like it
when we whisper.

24:58.938 --> 25:00.235
Why? Is he deaf?

25:00.315 --> 25:03.114
I didn't join this band to
sing Moon fuckin' River.

25:03.193 --> 25:04.285
You won't be playing it.

25:04.360 --> 25:06.863
It's merely my favorite
lip-loosener.

25:07.155 --> 25:08.748
We'll be playin' soul.

25:09.449 --> 25:12.874
See, the Lord told me
the Irish brothers needed some soul.

25:12.994 --> 25:14.371
Well, Ed Winchell,

25:14.454 --> 25:17.458
a Baptist reverend on Lenox Avenue
in Harlem, told me.

25:17.790 --> 25:20.509
But the Lord told him to tell me.

25:22.003 --> 25:23.471
He said the Irish brothers
wouldn't be

25:23.546 --> 25:25.640
shootin' the arses off each other

25:25.715 --> 25:27.968
if they had soul.

25:31.012 --> 25:32.389
I can't figure him out, Jimmy.

25:32.472 --> 25:34.895
He talks like a priest
and he's wearin' slippers!

25:35.058 --> 25:37.561
He's played with all the greats.
Even The Beatles.

25:37.685 --> 25:39.062

25:46.069 --> 25:47.446
What?

25:47.654 --> 25:50.077
A medical student.
He's not like the rest of us.

25:50.198 --> 25:51.290
Places we'll be playing,

25:51.366 --> 25:53.664
could be useful to have someone
that could bandage heads.

25:53.743 --> 25:56.292
I'm worried about the
direction we're takin'.

25:56.371 --> 26:00.251
Direction? What magazines you

26:00.583 --> 26:03.132
Look, with Joey and me,
we can touch greatness.

Oh! That's my boy Joey's.
They're out the back.

27:03.187 --> 27:06.737
Joey says no rehearsals till you get
friendly with your instruments.

27:07.108 --> 27:08.576
Friendly with mine already.

27:08.693 --> 27:09.865

27:09.986 --> 27:13.991

I like the sound 0' Deco.

27:14.282 --> 27:17.786
Deco the bus conductor.
Is that top Deco or bottom Deco?

27:18.453 --> 27:22.253
The only bollixin' thing that's
important is what this band's called.

27:22.832 --> 27:24.800
Joey knows. Tell them.

27:25.793 --> 27:27.090

you'll find a ladder.

27:34.135 --> 27:35.808

27:36.054 --> 27:37.271

29:34.881 --> 29:36.349
Jimmy says soul is sex.

29:36.424 --> 29:37.596
Dirty bastard!

29:37.758 --> 29:40.261
I didn't say that. I said the rhythm
of soul is the rhythm of ridin'.

29:40.553 --> 29:43.397
<i>You want us to sing as if
we were ridin' with someone?</i>

29:43.473 --> 29:45.396

29:52.440 --> 29:53.612
Soul is the rhythm of sex,

29:53.691 --> 29:55.193
and it's the rhythm
of the factory, too.

29:55.318 --> 29:57.616
The working man's rhythm.
Sex and the factory.

29:57.695 --> 30:00.574
Not in the factory I'm in.
Not much rhythm in guttin' fish!

30:01.782 --> 30:03.705
Soul is the music
that people understand.

30:03.784 --> 30:05.707
It's basic and it's simple.

30:05.786 --> 30:07.754

Somethin' special.

30:07.830 --> 30:09.924

30:10.208 --> 30:12.256

30:12.376 --> 30:14.879

There's lots of music
ya can get off on,

30:17.173 --> 30:19.050
but soul is more than that.

30:19.133 --> 30:20.760
