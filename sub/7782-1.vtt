One of the reasons why
I don't like the word "famous"

01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:54.724
because then people
use it afterwards

01:22:54.970 --> 01:22:57.473
and they go like,
"He used to be famous."

01:22:57.723 --> 01:22:59.145
Or, "He's not famous anymore."

01:22:59.391 --> 01:23:02.190

of, like...

01:23:03.479 --> 01:23:06.449

But people think they can
label your life.

just there because of me.
