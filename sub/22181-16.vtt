00:01.349 --> 00:02.785
[Kara]
Previously onSupergirl...

00:02.828 --> 00:04.091
Worldkillers.

00:04.134 --> 00:06.832
Unite beneath
the standard of Reign.

00:06.876 --> 00:08.617
Sam?

00:08.660 --> 00:10.749
When she takes over
you lose all awareness,
all control.

00:10.793 --> 00:12.099
We're gonna get you
through this.

00:13.056 --> 00:14.449
The third Worldkiller.

00:14.492 --> 00:16.668
In 1,000 years
she evolves into Blight.

00:17.104 --> 00:18.105
Pestilence.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.585
[indistinct chatter]

00:23.240 --> 00:24.546
-[woman] Thank you.
-Mmm-hmm.

00:25.851 --> 00:27.027
Oh, thank you.

00:28.898 --> 00:29.899
Oh.

00:30.247 --> 00:32.032
-Thanks, Addy.
-[chuckles]

00:34.425 --> 00:37.602
[mayor] I know
people are scared.
Well, it's kind of creepy.

00:37.646 --> 00:41.084
But, hey, at least
they'll stop complaining
about the pigeons.

00:41.128 --> 00:42.651
[laughing]

00:42.694 --> 00:44.870
Always time for a laugh,
Commissioner.

00:44.914 --> 00:46.089
I'll be in touch.

00:49.701 --> 00:50.746
Sir, your...

00:55.185 --> 00:56.273
[gasps]

00:59.363 --> 01:01.365
[Alex] Well, that was
a very sick creature.

01:01.409 --> 01:04.064
And what's odd is that
I can't find a virus
or infection of any kind.

01:04.107 --> 01:05.848
Well, something
must have done that.

01:05.891 --> 01:07.067
The Blight.

01:07.545 --> 01:09.069
We went through this
on Winath.

01:09.112 --> 01:11.984
The Blight is preceded
by mass wildlife death

01:12.028 --> 01:14.465
and plant life,
crops rotting in the Earth.

01:14.509 --> 01:16.206
Soon it will manifest
in people.

01:16.250 --> 01:17.468
[Mon-El] It's a short
incubation period.

01:17.512 --> 01:19.862
It's 100% fatal
and extremely contagious.

01:19.905 --> 01:23.866
Based on my tests,
whatever this bird had,
it wasn't transmittable.

01:23.909 --> 01:25.520
Not even from bird to bird.

01:25.563 --> 01:28.653
So it had to have
come in contact
with Pestilence herself.

01:28.697 --> 01:30.612
It might not be
contagious yet,

01:30.655 --> 01:35.138
but if Pestilence
gets stronger, even half
the strength of the Blight,

01:35.573 --> 01:37.836
the entire city would fall ill
in a matter of days.

01:37.880 --> 01:39.360
But we won't let her
get stronger.

01:39.838 --> 01:42.406
Now remember, the cure
is written in our DNA.

01:42.450 --> 01:45.409
With Brainy's help,
we'll be able to extract it,
weaponize it,

01:45.453 --> 01:48.934
and use it to kill Pestilence
before she ever becomes
the Blight.

01:48.978 --> 01:52.155
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
We're not killing anyone.

01:52.199 --> 01:54.114
We got too aggressive
with Purity,

01:54.157 --> 01:55.550
and that's when
things got worse.

01:55.593 --> 01:57.247
I'm not making
the same mistake twice.

01:57.291 --> 01:58.988
There is a human side
to Pestilence.

01:59.031 --> 02:01.164
We're gonna find her,
and we're going to save her.

02:01.208 --> 02:03.732
We came here to
end the threat to our time.

02:03.775 --> 02:05.734
And that means
ending her life in this time.

02:06.474 --> 02:08.215
It's just not how we operate.

02:08.258 --> 02:12.262
That's not how I usually
operate, but these are
extreme circumstances.

02:14.308 --> 02:15.831
Hey, stop right there.

02:15.874 --> 02:18.050
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Guys, it's Brainy.

02:19.095 --> 02:22.794
Oh, of course. I'm wearing
a personal image inducer.

02:25.232 --> 02:26.972
I had to purchase
some apple cider vinegar,

02:27.016 --> 02:29.453
and I nearly caused
a riot at the Piggly Wiggly.

02:30.237 --> 02:31.238
Huh.

02:32.543 --> 02:35.938
I thought this would, uh,
help me fit in better.

02:35.981 --> 02:37.940
Hey, guys, I just got word
from City Hall...

02:39.507 --> 02:40.551
Hey, Brainy.

02:40.595 --> 02:42.510
Wait, you recognize him?

02:43.250 --> 02:45.208
Yeah. What is that,
an image inducer?

02:45.774 --> 02:49.125
Eh? Ah, so our brains
just think we're seeing
a human, but no.

02:49.169 --> 02:50.735
Hey, can I borrow that
for Halloween?

02:50.779 --> 02:52.259
Agent Schott,
you were saying...

02:52.302 --> 02:53.434
Oh, yes!

02:53.477 --> 02:55.000
The mayor,
the chief of police,

02:55.044 --> 02:56.959
uh, like, five city
councilmen are all sick.

02:57.002 --> 02:58.743
High fevers, bloody noses.

02:58.787 --> 03:02.051
So either it was sushi day
at City Hall cafeteria or...
[grunts]

03:02.965 --> 03:04.401
It's her. Let's go.

03:04.445 --> 03:06.795
What? Hang on, hang on. Wait!

03:06.838 --> 03:10.494
We have sick people now.
So, let's go run some tests
on them.

03:10.538 --> 03:13.584
Meanwhile, you guys extract
the cure, so we can give it
to the victims.

03:13.628 --> 03:15.673
[Mon-El] It won't take long
on our end.

03:15.717 --> 03:17.197
So we'll meet up
with you later.

03:19.329 --> 03:22.332
Thank you.
Don't worry, we'll get her.

03:24.639 --> 03:26.206
[Sam] Explain it to me again.

03:27.250 --> 03:30.297
When Reign is triggered,
your genome is rewritten.

03:30.340 --> 03:33.909
And here's why you can't shoot
heat beams out of your eyes
whenever you want.

03:33.952 --> 03:36.999
So you think there's an enzyme
in my body that triggers
a change.

03:37.042 --> 03:40.132
Yes. And if we can isolate it,
we can eliminate it.

03:40.176 --> 03:41.177
And no more Reign.

03:42.831 --> 03:46.704
But in order to find it,
I need to study you
while you're her.

03:47.531 --> 03:51.796
And the only definite way
to turn me into her
is to electrocute me.

03:51.840 --> 03:53.450
The pain response
brings her out.

03:55.365 --> 03:56.584
How much is it gonna hurt?

03:58.412 --> 04:00.022
-We're going to start
with 500 volts.
-That's not what I asked.

04:02.198 --> 04:03.243
A lot.

04:04.592 --> 04:07.072
If we had more time,
we could find another way.

04:07.812 --> 04:09.249
But we don't.

04:10.859 --> 04:12.034
So we have to do it.

04:12.077 --> 04:13.078
Okay.

04:13.905 --> 04:14.993
[softly] Okay.

04:40.410 --> 04:42.499
-[electricity crackling]
-[gasps]

04:43.021 --> 04:44.284
[breathes heavily]

04:44.762 --> 04:46.286
[screaming]

04:55.425 --> 04:58.994
[Reign] You. I see you.

05:01.649 --> 05:03.955
-[gasps]
-They're coming for us.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.307
[theme music playing]

05:11.398 --> 05:13.138
[indistinct chatter]

05:15.315 --> 05:17.926
It's a nightmare,
it happened so fast.

05:17.969 --> 05:20.581
My chief of staff
and the councilwoman,

05:20.624 --> 05:22.887
we ordered a quarantine
immediately.

05:22.931 --> 05:24.193
You did the right thing.

05:24.236 --> 05:25.890
[coughing]

05:25.934 --> 05:28.502
You rest. We've got this.

05:31.461 --> 05:33.289
Did you see that mark
on his hand?

05:33.333 --> 05:35.073
Yeah, it must not be airborne.

05:35.117 --> 05:37.772
Alex, check and see
if any other patients
have similar marks.

05:37.815 --> 05:39.469
I'll check the visitor logs.

05:43.125 --> 05:45.345
Hey, are you okay?

05:46.389 --> 05:47.434
Do you need a doctor?

05:47.477 --> 05:51.394
No. I'm not sick, just scared.

05:52.743 --> 05:54.310
Everything's gonna be okay.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.926
As you can see,
most of the patients
have scratches,

06:01.970 --> 06:03.798
but none of them remember
being scratched.

06:03.841 --> 06:05.539
They probably
didn't even feel it.

06:05.582 --> 06:07.671
But I think it's the origin
of the infection.

06:07.715 --> 06:10.848
Okay, so everyone who is sick
was scratched by the source.

06:10.892 --> 06:13.764
That confirms your theory
that it was not passed
person-to-person.

06:13.808 --> 06:16.637
Well, if you're sure
it's not contagious, then
I need the quarantine lifted

06:16.680 --> 06:19.074
and the patients transferred
to the nearest
trauma facility.

06:19.117 --> 06:20.858
We have a lead on a treatment.

06:20.902 --> 06:22.120
You do? Already?

06:22.164 --> 06:23.339
Well, we work very fast

06:23.383 --> 06:25.123
on account of being
really smart.

06:25.167 --> 06:26.908
[chuckles]

06:26.951 --> 06:29.301
Some people find humor
charming during stressful
circumstances.

06:29.345 --> 06:30.955
I find it's a mask
for a lack of confidence.

06:32.392 --> 06:36.744
Well, I find that
I have no retort.

06:36.787 --> 06:38.659
We'll get
the patients transferred
as soon as possible.

06:38.702 --> 06:41.052
And when the treatment
is ready, we'll have it
widely distributed.

06:41.749 --> 06:43.098
You, I believe.

06:46.101 --> 06:47.276
Okay. So mean doctor says

06:47.319 --> 06:48.451
we have to lift
the quarantine.

06:48.495 --> 06:50.497
She's not mean,
she's just serious.

06:50.540 --> 06:52.324
And she's correct.

06:52.368 --> 06:54.022
If the same thing
that happened to the birds

06:54.065 --> 06:55.502
happens to these patients,

06:55.545 --> 06:57.895
they could descend into
catastrophic organ failure.

06:57.939 --> 06:59.941
There's a possibility
that Pestilence is still here.

06:59.984 --> 07:02.160
Mon-El did say that
there's an incubation period,

07:02.204 --> 07:04.380
but those scratches
did not look new.

07:04.424 --> 07:05.903
And she's probably
not even here anymore.

07:05.947 --> 07:08.384
Let's get all these people
to the hospital

07:08.428 --> 07:11.169
and J'onn, you and I can fly
the really sick ones.

07:11.213 --> 07:12.867
All right people,
let's keep it calm.

07:12.910 --> 07:15.260
The last thing we need
is a panic.

07:15.696 --> 07:17.915
-[people screaming]
-What is that?

07:19.787 --> 07:21.310
[siren wailing]

07:27.925 --> 07:29.100
[man] Let me out of here!

07:29.361 --> 07:31.755
-So much for avoiding a panic.
-[sighs]

07:40.285 --> 07:42.374
[Supergirl]
Take down the force field.
[Imra] Did you find her?

07:42.418 --> 07:45.508
Take it down, now! We have
to get these people
to a hospital.

07:45.552 --> 07:47.075
Is Pestilence here?

07:47.118 --> 07:48.555
There's no sign of her now.

07:48.598 --> 07:50.861
Just scared people who need
real medical attention.

07:50.905 --> 07:52.210
Take it down!

08:02.394 --> 08:03.831
Shouldn't you be working
on the cure?

08:03.874 --> 08:05.833
Brainy and Mon-El
are getting the transfer
set up now.

08:05.876 --> 08:07.399
Well, we can handle this.

08:07.443 --> 08:10.490
You say that, but you do not
know what you're up against.

08:15.495 --> 08:16.974
[groans and breathes heavily]

08:22.980 --> 08:23.981
[sighs]

08:28.333 --> 08:31.206
Reign was there,
in the dark valley.

08:31.946 --> 08:33.251
What valley?

08:33.295 --> 08:36.341
I just thought it was
in my dreams, my nightmares,

08:37.168 --> 08:39.170
but it was real this time.

08:40.171 --> 08:41.608
And I remember everything.

08:41.651 --> 08:43.566
She was talking to me
like I'm talking to you.

08:49.224 --> 08:50.834
It's a parallel dimension.

08:52.009 --> 08:53.663
It's where you go
when Reign takes over.

08:53.707 --> 08:55.752
It's why you can't
remember anything.

08:55.796 --> 08:59.451
When your body transforms
into Reign, your mind
literally goes there.

08:59.495 --> 09:01.584
Well, we were both there
this time.

09:01.628 --> 09:04.108
I mean, I've been suppressing
Reign's consciousness.

09:05.109 --> 09:08.635
She couldn't manifest fully
in this world,

09:08.678 --> 09:12.029
so she existed in that one
with you, together.

09:12.073 --> 09:14.075
She said they were
coming for us.

09:14.118 --> 09:16.556
-Who's coming?
-I don't know.

09:17.295 --> 09:18.296
[sighs]

09:19.646 --> 09:20.821
Did you find what triggers
the transformation?

09:21.169 --> 09:22.170
Not yet.

09:23.475 --> 09:25.042
I need to increase
the voltage.

09:25.652 --> 09:27.479
I need more time
to observe Reign.

09:28.480 --> 09:29.656
Okay.

09:33.007 --> 09:34.661
You shouldn't have gone
to City Hall.

09:35.487 --> 09:37.359
Kara said she had it handled.

09:37.402 --> 09:39.491
She's not taking it
seriously enough.

09:39.535 --> 09:42.930
No one takes the protection
of this planet more seriously
than she does.

09:45.062 --> 09:47.238
Look, I know what
this mission means to you.

09:47.282 --> 09:48.892
This isn't about me.

09:49.458 --> 09:50.894
This is about the Legion.

09:50.938 --> 09:53.070
And our mission is to save
the people of our time.

09:53.114 --> 09:57.422
There has to be a way
to do this without making
a moral compromise.

09:58.075 --> 10:00.817
We base the entire philosophy
of the Legion on Supergirl.

10:00.861 --> 10:04.125
Have you considered that
she might have
the right approach here?

10:04.168 --> 10:05.996
Success is the only thing
that matters.

10:07.084 --> 10:08.608
[automated voice]
Transfusion complete.

10:09.696 --> 10:10.827
You're done already?

10:10.871 --> 10:12.568
You always were
a little bit slow.

10:18.748 --> 10:20.881
So, Winn's running through
security footage

10:20.924 --> 10:23.623
to see who came in contact
with everyone who got sick.

10:23.666 --> 10:25.799
Well, I just got word that
Brainy, Imra and Mon-El

10:25.842 --> 10:27.627
have extracted the cure,

10:27.670 --> 10:29.759
and they're manufacturing
doses as we speak.

10:29.803 --> 10:32.675
So, hopefully it's
just a matter of time.

10:32.719 --> 10:33.937
Hopefully. [sighs]

10:35.069 --> 10:36.113
Hey...

10:37.462 --> 10:40.770
I know that you're frustrated,
okay?

10:40.814 --> 10:44.339
But there's still a really
good chance that Imra
could come around.

10:44.382 --> 10:46.428
You know, and that we can
work with her on this.

10:46.471 --> 10:48.909
She might have some
really important insight
into Pestilence.

10:48.952 --> 10:50.519
Yeah, to kill her.

10:51.781 --> 10:52.913
I don't kill.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.786
I mean, you know
it's possible to reach them.

10:56.830 --> 10:59.354
You of all people understand
how important it is

10:59.397 --> 11:00.660
to help whoever's
in Pestilence.

11:01.225 --> 11:02.357
Yeah, of course I do.

11:03.184 --> 11:04.489
But I didn't see that
at first.

11:04.533 --> 11:05.752
You were the one
who convinced me

11:05.795 --> 11:07.797
that the Worldkillers
could even be saved.

11:08.537 --> 11:11.496
So maybe Imra just needs
a little more convincing.

11:11.540 --> 11:13.585
I've been trying. She's...

11:14.195 --> 11:16.980
She's being irrational.
She's just not
listening to me.

11:17.677 --> 11:18.678
[Winn] I think I found her.

11:19.330 --> 11:20.331
[panting] Hey!

11:21.768 --> 11:23.465
Okay, so there was one person
who came in contact

11:23.508 --> 11:25.685
with everybody who got sick
at the mayor's office.

11:26.337 --> 11:28.339
Adelaide Swanson,
an administrator

11:28.383 --> 11:31.691
known for her famous
lemon poppy seed cookies.

11:32.343 --> 11:35.085
A Worldkiller
that bakes cookies.
That's unexpected.

11:35.129 --> 11:36.521
Wait, let me see.

11:37.348 --> 11:40.177
Yeah. Yeah, I saw her
at City Hall. She looked...

11:42.179 --> 11:43.572
Well, she looked terrified.

11:44.573 --> 11:45.748
Just like Julia.

11:48.446 --> 11:51.058
[Alex] Supergirl, I'll have
J'onn meet you there
with a strike team.

11:52.189 --> 11:54.844
Imra! Get away from her.

11:55.497 --> 11:56.498
[sighs]

11:59.980 --> 12:01.111
What did you do?

12:01.155 --> 12:02.156
I didn't do anything.

12:03.461 --> 12:05.159
She was dead when I got here.

12:06.247 --> 12:08.728
It's not Pestilence,
she's human.

12:09.293 --> 12:10.425
A victim.

12:11.556 --> 12:13.167
How did you know she was here?

12:14.385 --> 12:16.823
Brainiac-5 has all
the same data you do.

12:16.866 --> 12:18.607
So you came here
without telling me.

12:21.088 --> 12:23.394
Stand down, stand down.

12:23.438 --> 12:26.223
We got the wrong person,
she's a human. A victim.

12:28.356 --> 12:29.749
Winn, Alex, keep looking.

12:30.184 --> 12:32.012
[Winn] Man, I was so sure
it was gonna be her.

12:32.055 --> 12:33.970
I mean, according to the
security footage,

12:34.014 --> 12:36.625
she's the only person
that came in contact
with all the victims.

12:38.670 --> 12:40.107
-Winn.
-Hmm?

12:40.672 --> 12:42.457
-Your nose.
-My nose...

12:44.241 --> 12:46.809
J'onn, Supergirl,
you need to get back here now.

12:46.853 --> 12:48.245
It's Winn.

12:53.076 --> 12:56.036
James! Hey, tell him
I'm not dying.

12:56.079 --> 12:57.428
Hey, James. He's not dying.

12:57.472 --> 12:59.256
-We're giving him
the Legion's cure.
-[chuckles]

12:59.300 --> 13:01.737
Which by my calculations
should have him rebounding

13:01.781 --> 13:04.914
in approximately 2.45...
Three, four hours.

13:04.958 --> 13:06.829
Okay. How you doing, buddy?

13:06.873 --> 13:08.657
-You should be at CatCo.
-It's called delegation.

13:08.700 --> 13:10.790
I've got every reporter
in the building
working on this.

13:10.833 --> 13:12.008
Which actually reminds me,

13:12.052 --> 13:13.967
the city is pretty panicked
about this.

13:14.010 --> 13:16.491
So if you have any information
I can disseminate,
that would be helpful.

13:16.534 --> 13:18.319
Doses of the cure
are on their way
to all the hospitals.

13:18.362 --> 13:20.887
And the Worldkiller
is still MIA.

13:20.930 --> 13:23.454
Yeah, but now that
Winn is infected, doesn't that
give us another lead?

13:23.498 --> 13:26.240
Yes. The scratch
on your hand seems
to be the point of infection.

13:26.283 --> 13:27.719
Don't touch that.

13:27.763 --> 13:30.113
Winn, you're a slightly
smarter-than-average human.

13:30.157 --> 13:32.942
Please tell us you remember
who scratched you.

13:33.377 --> 13:35.118
[gasps] Oh!

13:35.162 --> 13:37.686
Well, there was the guy
with the gloves,

13:38.295 --> 13:40.820
and the knives
and then the burnt face.

13:40.863 --> 13:42.952
Go on. This sounds like
a very promising lead.

13:43.300 --> 13:44.824
What else do you remember?

13:44.867 --> 13:47.696
Oh, so scary, man.
I couldn't even look at it...

13:47.739 --> 13:48.915
It's Freddy Krueger.

13:48.958 --> 13:50.917
You know him, too. Eureka.

13:50.960 --> 13:52.309
It's a character in a movie.

13:52.701 --> 13:53.702
[laughing]

13:54.659 --> 13:55.747
[Brainy] Facetiousness.

13:56.183 --> 13:57.706
It's my greatest weakness.

13:57.749 --> 13:59.795
The scratches don't seem
to manifest
until the symptoms do.

13:59.839 --> 14:02.929
And the only trace evidence
I could find
is a mild anesthetic.

14:02.972 --> 14:04.800
Well, Alex, keep running
those tests.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.367
See if you can come up
with something more promising.

14:07.150 --> 14:09.109
In the meantime,
get a team out.

14:09.152 --> 14:11.676
See if you can talk
to these patients
and find a common link.

14:11.938 --> 14:13.287
Hey. [laughing]

14:15.245 --> 14:17.682
Um, I'll come check in,
but there's something
I have to take care of.

14:17.726 --> 14:18.727
Okie dokie.

14:21.121 --> 14:22.774
Um, hang in there.

14:22.818 --> 14:23.863
Mmm-hmm.

14:25.299 --> 14:28.128
Imra, why did you
go behind my back?

14:28.171 --> 14:31.435
-[sighs]
I didn't have a choice.
-You always have a choice.

14:31.479 --> 14:33.220
No, I don't.

14:34.221 --> 14:37.354
Look, I don't wanna kill her
or anyone.

14:37.789 --> 14:39.748
I have the same ideals you do.

14:39.791 --> 14:42.142
You should know you don't get
to pick and choose
when your ideals matter.

14:42.185 --> 14:43.970
You either live by them
or you don't.

14:45.319 --> 14:46.973
You think this is bad?

14:47.016 --> 14:49.323
The Blight is so much worse.

14:49.584 --> 14:53.370
Every hospital bed
in every city
on every planet is overrun.

14:53.414 --> 14:54.719
Mass graves...

14:55.198 --> 14:56.939
So if it's between her

14:56.983 --> 14:59.942
and the millions of people
who die by the Blight
in the future,

14:59.986 --> 15:01.161
I'm going to kill her.

15:01.204 --> 15:03.641
The best way to defeat
the Worldkillers

15:03.685 --> 15:05.165
is by saving
their human sides.

15:05.208 --> 15:06.209
You're wrong.

15:06.601 --> 15:08.342
I'm from the future.

15:08.385 --> 15:10.170
I've seen what happens
if you're left to deal

15:10.213 --> 15:12.041
with the situation
the way you want to.

15:12.694 --> 15:14.914
The Blight happens.

15:14.957 --> 15:16.567
Pestilence survives.

15:18.395 --> 15:21.703
Whatever you do in this time
to try to stop her, fails.

15:22.965 --> 15:23.923
You fail.

15:25.228 --> 15:28.928
So if I get the chance,
I will end this.

15:39.025 --> 15:40.374
[breathing shakily]

15:47.468 --> 15:49.383
[Reign] I was here
for so long.

15:49.426 --> 15:50.427
Alone.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.821
You kept me here.

15:54.649 --> 15:55.867
You're strong.

15:56.607 --> 15:58.479
Much stronger
than you should be.

15:59.393 --> 16:00.655
But that will change.

16:02.048 --> 16:05.573
Your friend,
she's breaking your body.

16:06.443 --> 16:08.619
-You should stop her.
-Why?

16:09.969 --> 16:11.927
Because you're afraid
we're getting closer.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.276
No.

16:15.409 --> 16:18.499
Because it will be
so much better if you give in.

16:20.196 --> 16:22.111
There's bliss in surrender.

16:24.287 --> 16:25.810
I've seen your life.

16:27.682 --> 16:32.078
All those sleepless,
solitary nights
where you stare into the dark.

16:32.121 --> 16:34.602
Not even able to dream
of an escape.

16:36.604 --> 16:38.867
You've been trapped
since Ruby was born.

16:41.652 --> 16:43.480
It doesn't have
to be that way.

16:45.656 --> 16:47.310
There's another life.

16:48.485 --> 16:49.965
One of power...

16:51.358 --> 16:52.663
Control.

16:55.101 --> 16:56.493
It's here for you.

16:57.451 --> 16:59.888
Just reach out and take it.

17:01.063 --> 17:02.891
You'll be free, Samantha.

17:04.893 --> 17:06.242
Surrender.

17:18.341 --> 17:20.126
[gasps and breathes heavily]

17:20.691 --> 17:22.911
Sam. Sam, it's okay.
Just deep breaths,
deep breaths.

17:22.954 --> 17:24.782
-Calm down.
-I can't go back in there.

17:24.826 --> 17:26.175
We have to find another way.

17:26.219 --> 17:28.743
There is no other way.
I know how hard this is...

17:28.786 --> 17:30.571
No! No, you don't.

17:31.093 --> 17:33.313
It's like facing your shadow.

17:33.356 --> 17:35.706
Everything dark
you've ever feared
about yourself.

17:35.750 --> 17:37.404
[breathing heavily]

17:37.665 --> 17:40.363
If you don't do this,
Reign will take control
of your body,

17:40.407 --> 17:43.714
and she will condemn you
to that place forever, okay?
She will win.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.067
Okay.

17:49.285 --> 17:50.417
Just give me a minute.

17:51.548 --> 17:52.593
Okay.

17:52.636 --> 17:54.334
[breathing deeply]

18:06.389 --> 18:08.522
-He's gonna be okay.
-I know.

18:09.784 --> 18:11.090
It's not just that.

18:14.093 --> 18:15.920
Do you think I'll get through
to Pestilence?

18:17.618 --> 18:20.577
There's no way of knowing.
You just have to try.

18:21.926 --> 18:23.580
That's not what
Yoda would say.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.583
[scoffs] Oh, yeah, Yoda.

18:27.497 --> 18:29.195
"Do or do not." [scoffs]

18:29.717 --> 18:32.067
-He was wrong about that one.
-[chuckles]

18:33.503 --> 18:37.333
You know, these days,
I don't know what my father
will remember.

18:37.725 --> 18:40.119
I wake up and have the same
conversation with him
every day.

18:42.904 --> 18:45.036
I keep at it because
sometimes he remembers

18:45.080 --> 18:47.822
we've had that conversation
before, and we actually
laugh about it.

18:49.476 --> 18:50.912
I keep trying.

18:51.913 --> 18:53.262
I keep talking...

18:54.437 --> 18:56.439
So that he can find
those moments of clarity.

18:58.224 --> 18:59.442
And laugh.

19:02.445 --> 19:05.796
Just because something's hard
doesn't mean it's impossible.

19:05.840 --> 19:07.798
You break through
impossible every day.

19:07.842 --> 19:10.105
You inspire the rest of us
to do the same.

19:13.195 --> 19:14.631
You're a good son.

19:16.633 --> 19:17.808
And thank you.

19:24.511 --> 19:25.512
[sighs]

19:28.471 --> 19:29.646
[Mon-El] Did you talk to Kara?

19:31.387 --> 19:32.388
Yes.

19:33.650 --> 19:35.174
And she didn't listen
to reason.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.002
You didn't tell her
the whole story, did you?

19:40.048 --> 19:42.137
You keep saying
this is a Legion mission,

19:44.139 --> 19:47.708
but you made this decision
on your own out of vengeance.

19:49.492 --> 19:53.017
I'm doing this to save
countless lives in the future.

19:53.670 --> 19:57.370
I'm perfectly capable
of keeping my personal
feelings out of this.

19:59.154 --> 20:00.851
You brought me here.

20:01.330 --> 20:03.071
You can't keep punishing me
for it.

20:12.167 --> 20:14.952
Are you two having
a marital conflict
which I should stay out of,

20:14.996 --> 20:18.260
or is this a work-related
quandary where my intellect
might be of use?

20:18.304 --> 20:22.438
Why didn't you tell me
about this mission before
we came here, Brainy?

20:22.482 --> 20:24.048
Because you would've
never agreed to it.

20:25.049 --> 20:26.529
-To come back.
-How do you know?

20:28.531 --> 20:30.881
Obviously, I ran simulations
based off specific
emotional behavioral data

20:30.925 --> 20:32.579
taken from your brain
over the last seven years.

20:33.797 --> 20:35.103
The results were troubling.

20:40.021 --> 20:43.154
We took an oath
when we formed the Legion.

20:44.330 --> 20:48.072
To preserve all that is good
and to never
harm the innocent.

20:49.596 --> 20:52.903
How is this mission
in line with that?
We should not kill Pestilence.

20:54.644 --> 20:56.080
And you're obviously
on Imra's side.

20:57.256 --> 20:58.953
It's not about picking sides,
Mon-El.

20:59.606 --> 21:02.043
If we kill Pestilence
when we find her,

21:02.086 --> 21:06.395
there is a 98.459% chance
the Blight will never happen.

21:06.439 --> 21:09.224
Millions of people
will be saved.

21:09.268 --> 21:11.226
Now, if we try to rescue
the person inside of her

21:11.270 --> 21:15.230
in order to defeat her,
that chance is reduced
to 52.744%.

21:17.145 --> 21:19.321
Some decisions can't be made
with a math equation.

21:25.371 --> 21:28.939
Mon-El, something's happened
to Winn.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.593
[groaning]

21:31.290 --> 21:34.293
[stammering] Just a thought.
I don't...

21:34.945 --> 21:37.905
Don't think the cure
is working.

21:37.948 --> 21:39.341
[breathing rapidly]

21:39.385 --> 21:42.083
[Supergirl] Oh, my God.
[Alex] All right.

21:44.520 --> 21:46.305
This should keep him stable
for now.

21:46.522 --> 21:47.784
Come on, Winn.

21:48.568 --> 21:50.047
[breathing slows down]

21:50.787 --> 21:52.223
What happened?

21:52.267 --> 21:54.225
[Brainy mumbling]
Oh, yes, there it is.
I see it now.

21:54.269 --> 21:56.837
The cure is designed
to cure victims of the Blight.

21:56.880 --> 21:59.230
But because Pestilence is not
technically the Blight

21:59.274 --> 22:01.407
but the forebearer of it,
the cure we have

22:01.450 --> 22:04.148
needs to be modified to fight
her particular
strand of virus.

22:04.192 --> 22:05.585
So, how do we do that?

22:05.628 --> 22:07.587
We need a piece
of Pestilence's DNA.

22:07.630 --> 22:10.111
So if we can't find her,
more people could get infected

22:10.154 --> 22:12.069
and the people
that are already infected--

22:12.113 --> 22:15.769
Yes, finding her as soon as
humanly or non-humanly
possible would be...

22:15.812 --> 22:17.379
-[Alex groans]
-No.

22:17.423 --> 22:20.034
-Alex!
-No, no, no! Alex, Alex!

22:20.382 --> 22:21.557
...imperative.

22:29.652 --> 22:30.653
[gasps]

22:36.224 --> 22:37.530
[Alex coughs]

22:37.573 --> 22:38.661
Hey.

22:38.922 --> 22:40.663
[Alex breathing heavily]

22:44.014 --> 22:45.320
I should be helping.

22:45.364 --> 22:47.540
-You need to rest.
-No. Let me...

22:47.583 --> 22:49.803
No. We're on it, I promise.

22:49.846 --> 22:51.500
Alex, whatever
you have attacking you,

22:52.022 --> 22:53.894
you are stronger than it.

22:53.937 --> 22:56.026
No one's more of a fighter
than you.

22:56.070 --> 22:57.767
Keep holding on, okay?

23:09.257 --> 23:10.258
[Alex coughing]

23:16.699 --> 23:17.918
[Winn gasps]

23:18.309 --> 23:19.310
[sighs]

23:20.921 --> 23:23.532
-[groans] I can't even...
-What's going on?

23:23.576 --> 23:25.578
No, it's just ironic.

23:26.230 --> 23:29.408
After 20 years, I finally
make peace with my mom

23:30.234 --> 23:34.238
and then I get infected
by Pestilence.

23:34.500 --> 23:36.763
-You're gonna get better.
-[groans] Maybe...

23:37.938 --> 23:41.071
Dude, I was attacked
by a Worldkiller.

23:42.246 --> 23:43.857
There's no cure.

23:43.900 --> 23:47.208
Hey, don't go there. Winn,
you cannot think like that,
brother.

23:47.251 --> 23:52.431
It's just... This is just
making me reflect on my life.

23:54.694 --> 23:56.696
[sighs] You know what?

23:57.261 --> 23:59.916
After we reconnected,
my mom and I,

24:00.569 --> 24:02.745
I hadn't realized, like,

24:03.267 --> 24:08.925
so much of my baggage was tied
into her abandoning me.

24:09.578 --> 24:13.626
Like, all my life I never
felt like I deserved anything.

24:14.278 --> 24:19.980
But you know what,
I have done great
despite circumstances.

24:21.416 --> 24:28.118
I made some true friendships.

24:28.728 --> 24:29.903
[sniffles]

24:31.948 --> 24:34.211
That has been
the best part of my life.

24:36.823 --> 24:39.695
And now I can finally
let myself imagine

24:39.739 --> 24:41.741
what I'd do
if I could do anything.

24:42.611 --> 24:46.049
Like, if I could really
be anything.

24:46.485 --> 24:49.226
Like, I could be
the next Steve Jobs.

24:49.749 --> 24:53.709
Or I could make
a rocket for NASA.

24:53.753 --> 24:57.713
I can build
human transportation
to another planet,

24:57.757 --> 25:00.760
show Elon Musk how it's done.
Like, I could.

25:02.152 --> 25:05.242
[sobbing] Like, I'm ready.

25:07.810 --> 25:10.160
And I think
it might be too late.

25:10.465 --> 25:13.076
You are gonna do everything
that you want.

25:28.614 --> 25:30.137
-Get some rest.
-Yeah.

25:34.402 --> 25:36.273
-[line ringing]
-[sighs]

25:37.666 --> 25:39.102
[cell phone vibrating]

25:44.499 --> 25:46.762
James, this really isn't
a good time.

25:46.806 --> 25:48.198
Winn and Alex are sick.

25:48.547 --> 25:50.157
-I'm so sorry.
-Lena.

25:50.897 --> 25:53.334
You have
the largest pharmaceutical
company in the country

25:53.377 --> 25:55.597
-I really need you
to put your people on this.
-[coughing]

25:55.641 --> 25:56.729
I'm already working on it.

25:57.381 --> 25:59.558
-You are?
-Yeah.

26:00.384 --> 26:03.910
Well, that's great news,
right?
Have you told Supergirl?

26:04.606 --> 26:07.827
Listen, I can't really
say anything and please
don't say anything to her.

26:07.870 --> 26:09.872
I don't want to over-promise,
but...

26:10.743 --> 26:12.396
I'm really close
to a breakthrough.

26:13.876 --> 26:15.704
I'm really sorry
I can't be there with you.

26:16.313 --> 26:17.706
Yeah, it's just, uh...

26:19.055 --> 26:20.579
It's just tough being here
with him like this

26:20.622 --> 26:22.189
and not being able
to do anything.

26:22.232 --> 26:23.233
You are doing something.

26:24.234 --> 26:25.322
I'm glad you called.

26:26.541 --> 26:27.586
Me, too.

26:35.506 --> 26:36.507
Ready?

27:01.794 --> 27:03.752
[Reign] Why would you
hide from me?

27:05.493 --> 27:07.887
Now that you have seen
what you can be.

27:11.281 --> 27:13.066
The power you can have.

27:13.675 --> 27:15.024
[breathing heavily]

27:17.070 --> 27:18.375
I don't want it.

27:19.376 --> 27:21.117
You're nothing but a cancer.

27:21.161 --> 27:23.772
I know you think
you're gonna escape
and take control.

27:24.120 --> 27:26.732
But my friend and I
are gonna stop you.

27:27.950 --> 27:30.953
Just wait and see what your
defiance will cost you.

27:31.954 --> 27:34.783
I will turn your world
into ash.

27:35.392 --> 27:37.133
Especially her.

27:37.743 --> 27:40.441
Your heart, your strength.

27:40.484 --> 27:42.530
-I will kill Ruby.
-[yelps]

27:42.573 --> 27:43.749
-Burn her.
-No.

27:43.792 --> 27:47.143
Cut her inside out.

27:47.187 --> 27:48.623
[screams]

27:48.667 --> 27:51.191
-Stop, stop, stop.
-[breathing heavily] No!

27:51.234 --> 27:53.280
[shushing] It's okay.
Hey, hey.

27:53.323 --> 27:55.108
-She said she was gonna
kill Ruby.
-No.

27:55.151 --> 27:56.979
No, she can't kill her.
Ruby's safe.

27:57.806 --> 27:59.112
Did you find the trigger?

27:59.852 --> 28:00.853
No.

28:01.157 --> 28:02.724
Then Ruby is not safe.

28:02.768 --> 28:04.160
We need to stop Reign.

28:04.204 --> 28:06.162
That is what
we are doing, Sam.

28:07.033 --> 28:08.599
We need to get some help.

28:10.384 --> 28:11.864
Before we started this,

28:11.907 --> 28:14.257
Alex was trying to figure out
what was wrong with me.

28:14.997 --> 28:16.172
Or maybe Supergirl.

28:16.564 --> 28:18.479
-You can call Supergirl.
You can--
-Sam.

28:18.522 --> 28:20.611
-You can find her, right?
-Sam. Sam, okay?

28:21.743 --> 28:24.093
Reign is the most wanted
criminal in the world.

28:24.137 --> 28:25.921
If I go to Supergirl
or the government

28:25.965 --> 28:27.662
before I can prove
I can turn her off,

28:27.706 --> 28:29.795
they will treat you
like you're the same,
all right?

28:29.838 --> 28:32.362
They will lock you up,
they will dissect you--

28:32.406 --> 28:34.538
It wouldn't be
any worse than this, Lena.

28:35.452 --> 28:37.454
-We need to get help.
-Shh. Okay.

28:38.368 --> 28:39.369
I swear

28:40.675 --> 28:42.721
I am the only one
who knows how to do this.

28:43.591 --> 28:45.375
I promise you, I will do it.

28:47.203 --> 28:49.162
I'm not gonna let her
hurt Ruby.

28:49.771 --> 28:50.729
Ever.

28:51.730 --> 28:52.731
Okay?

28:54.471 --> 28:55.472
I promise.

28:57.736 --> 28:58.737
Okay?

28:59.868 --> 29:00.869
It's okay.

29:03.654 --> 29:05.221
[Supergirl] Winn and Alex
are going downhill.

29:07.180 --> 29:08.529
With all the information
we have, we have to be able
to find something.

29:08.572 --> 29:10.183
Well, I'm doing the best
I can here.

29:10.226 --> 29:12.272
I followed Agent Schott
and Danvers
on security footage

29:12.315 --> 29:14.709
when they were at City Hall,
assuming they ran
into Pestilence,

29:14.753 --> 29:17.581
but they spent 60% of the time
in blind spots.

29:17.625 --> 29:19.758
It's like they were trying
to evade cameras.

29:20.280 --> 29:21.498
What about Adelaide?

29:21.760 --> 29:22.978
I followed her like the others

29:23.022 --> 29:24.240
on every camera
I could find in the city.

29:24.588 --> 29:25.894
Didn't reveal any suspects.

29:25.938 --> 29:27.504
What about social media?

29:28.288 --> 29:29.419
Social... What?

29:30.812 --> 29:32.858
In this time, a generation
called Millennials

29:32.901 --> 29:35.034
would share their whereabouts
with family, friends

29:35.077 --> 29:36.862
and complete strangers
on the Internet.

29:36.905 --> 29:38.602
It's a short-lived trend.

29:39.038 --> 29:40.213
-Sounds delusional.
-Yeah.

29:40.648 --> 29:41.649
Here.

29:42.084 --> 29:43.651
Twenty-four hours before
her death

29:43.694 --> 29:46.436
she brought cookies
to a mobile flu unit
at City Hall.

29:46.480 --> 29:48.221
That doesn't tell us anything.
She works there.

29:48.264 --> 29:50.049
But look who's behind her.

29:50.701 --> 29:54.618
That's that doctor.
She was talking
to Winn and Alex at City Hall.

29:54.662 --> 29:56.446
If she was there
24 hours earlier,

29:56.490 --> 29:59.580
she must have infected
the mayor and everyone else.
I'm sure of it.

29:59.623 --> 30:01.451
I didn't see her with him
in the security footage.

30:02.322 --> 30:03.802
But you said
there were blind spots.

30:03.845 --> 30:04.933
She's Pestilence.

30:05.455 --> 30:06.456
She has to be.

30:08.328 --> 30:10.069
Dr. Grace Parker,

30:10.112 --> 30:11.897
first in her class
at Metropolis
University School of Medicine,

30:11.940 --> 30:15.117
now practices
emergency surgery
at National City General.

30:15.161 --> 30:16.597
She's a doctor.

30:16.640 --> 30:18.120
She heals people for a living.

30:18.425 --> 30:20.035
You can get through to her.

30:20.079 --> 30:21.645
We're not gonna make
the same mistake
we made with Julia.

30:21.689 --> 30:23.299
Is she still at the hospital?

30:23.343 --> 30:25.301
Actually, according
to a simple scan

30:25.345 --> 30:27.042
of security cameras
throughout the city,

30:27.086 --> 30:29.610
it seems she entered
the Silvermine
Health Insurance building

30:29.653 --> 30:30.785
five minutes ago.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.918
-I'm going.
-I'll come with you.

30:33.179 --> 30:34.571
[J'onn J'onzz]
I'll organize a strike team.

30:40.534 --> 30:41.578
[into comms] Imra.

30:42.362 --> 30:43.363
They found her.

31:04.688 --> 31:06.952
[man speaking indistinctly]

31:11.695 --> 31:14.481
We can't forget
it's the evaluation
itself that's in question...

31:15.221 --> 31:16.526
Can I help you?

31:16.570 --> 31:19.660
You could have
but you missed your chance.

31:20.226 --> 31:24.056
You sit here wallowing
in your own ignorance.

31:24.621 --> 31:27.842
Looking for any reason
you can to deny your customers

31:27.886 --> 31:30.149
the very service
you have sold them.

31:30.192 --> 31:32.151
-Can we get security in here?
-You won't need them.

31:32.194 --> 31:34.980
Life-and-death decisions
are out of your hands now.

31:35.023 --> 31:37.243
Just make your point
and get out, okay?

31:38.026 --> 31:39.549
I was hoping you'd say that.

31:40.768 --> 31:42.552
Don't take another step,
Grace.

31:43.597 --> 31:45.164
It's not Grace anymore.

31:46.905 --> 31:49.559
You would save
even these scabs?

31:49.603 --> 31:51.866
They who profit
on the suffering of others?

31:51.910 --> 31:53.215
Everyone deserves saving.

31:53.259 --> 31:55.348
Not them. They're not good.

31:55.391 --> 31:56.392
But you are.

31:57.741 --> 32:00.396
Imra, wait. Give her a chance.

32:00.440 --> 32:02.529
Think of the lives
you've saved.

32:02.572 --> 32:04.531
You're a doctor, Grace.

32:04.574 --> 32:07.142
The day you took an oath
you swore you would
do no harm.

32:08.361 --> 32:10.450
"Do no harm." [shudders]

32:14.280 --> 32:15.281
Grace...

32:17.936 --> 32:18.937
It's gonna be okay.

32:20.677 --> 32:23.419
My mother used to always
say that good would be
rewarded with Grace.

32:23.463 --> 32:24.464
[chuckles]

32:25.944 --> 32:28.947
But when I became a surgeon
I finally saw the truth.

32:30.600 --> 32:33.081
There's no reward
for being good.

32:33.560 --> 32:37.433
Whatever's happening
to you doesn't give you power
over who lives.

32:38.304 --> 32:39.958
Only over who dies.

32:40.610 --> 32:41.960
You don't want that.

32:43.613 --> 32:44.919
We can stop it.

32:48.488 --> 32:49.489
"Stop it"?

32:53.058 --> 32:54.624
Why would I ever
wanna stop it?

32:55.277 --> 32:58.150
This is the greatest thing
that's ever happened to me.

32:58.498 --> 33:00.979
I don't have to worry about
saving anyone anymore

33:01.022 --> 33:03.068
-because I don't want to.
-No--

33:03.111 --> 33:05.070
-I get to choose who dies.
-Grace...

33:05.113 --> 33:08.812
They say that surgeons
have a God complex,
but it's simple.

33:09.335 --> 33:11.467
I am a God.

33:45.545 --> 33:46.546
[grunts]

33:48.156 --> 33:50.202
You honestly thought you could
talk me into being redeemed?

33:50.637 --> 33:51.942
You're such a child.

33:52.682 --> 33:54.858
Words will never hurt me.

33:54.902 --> 33:56.338
What about sticks and stones?

34:18.230 --> 34:19.709
[grunting]

34:28.240 --> 34:29.241
[pants]

34:32.418 --> 34:37.466
[chuckles] Oh, Supergirl,
you got a little something.

34:39.555 --> 34:40.991
[gasping]

34:44.386 --> 34:45.387
[groans]

34:53.439 --> 34:54.744
Imra...

34:58.444 --> 34:59.445
[grunts]

35:13.067 --> 35:14.373
[breathing shakily]

35:17.202 --> 35:18.812
-She's here.
-[thunder cracks]

35:18.855 --> 35:19.943
[gasps]

35:22.598 --> 35:23.599
Julia!

35:25.035 --> 35:26.036
[screaming]

35:39.137 --> 35:40.399
[panting]

35:43.271 --> 35:44.359
Sister...

35:44.968 --> 35:46.187
I found you.

35:51.975 --> 35:53.151
She was dying.

35:53.977 --> 35:55.370
Purity made her stronger.

35:56.110 --> 35:57.111
[panting]

35:58.156 --> 35:59.200
Oh, wait!

36:01.289 --> 36:02.290
It's hers.

36:02.812 --> 36:04.074
It's her DNA.

36:04.118 --> 36:05.859
Is that enough
for Brainy to alter the cure?

36:06.468 --> 36:07.774
It's more than enough.

36:21.353 --> 36:24.225
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

36:24.269 --> 36:27.097
[stammers] Yes, I'm just fine.

36:27.141 --> 36:29.274
Just a little weak.
Are you okay?

36:29.317 --> 36:30.318
I'm alive.

36:31.841 --> 36:34.366
Hey, nice to see you both up.

36:34.801 --> 36:36.194
You had us
a little worried there.

36:36.498 --> 36:37.673
Wait a minute. Where's Winn?

36:39.022 --> 36:40.546
Against my better judgment,
he's back at work.

36:40.894 --> 36:42.069
Oh, what a suck-up.

36:43.636 --> 36:46.029
You have no idea how happy
I am to see you healthy again.

36:48.075 --> 36:49.337
Did we get her?

36:49.381 --> 36:52.210
-Not yet.
-But, we'll keep trying.

36:52.906 --> 36:54.473
-Yeah.
-I'll be downstairs.

36:54.516 --> 36:55.517
Okay.

37:01.219 --> 37:03.351
You know, maybe I'm being
a little selfish, but, um...

37:04.918 --> 37:07.399
I couldn't imagine
getting through the next
few months without you.

37:08.356 --> 37:09.749
Dealing with my father

37:11.185 --> 37:13.231
and all of the
unexpected things to come.

37:13.274 --> 37:15.058
I would never let
you go through that alone.

37:16.582 --> 37:18.018
It's been a big year.

37:18.584 --> 37:19.628
Hey, come on...

37:29.899 --> 37:31.423
We were so close.

37:32.250 --> 37:35.078
There was no way of knowing
Purity would show up.

37:36.297 --> 37:38.125
Or that she would
make her stronger.

37:40.562 --> 37:41.911
You said I would fail...

37:42.912 --> 37:44.479
I should have listened to you.

37:44.523 --> 37:46.089
No, don't say that.

37:46.133 --> 37:48.135
I've always followed
my instincts.

37:50.746 --> 37:52.661
But now, I... [scoffs]

37:53.009 --> 37:54.446
I don't know what to follow.

37:54.489 --> 37:56.143
I never came here to

37:56.665 --> 37:59.755
make you doubt who you are
or what you believe.

38:00.669 --> 38:03.281
I was wrong to try
to make you change. Yeah.

38:04.499 --> 38:06.936
I never told you
what I saw on Fort Rozz,

38:07.937 --> 38:09.287
when Psi got into my head.

38:11.941 --> 38:13.160
It was my sister.

38:13.769 --> 38:15.641
-I didn't know you had--
-I don't...

38:17.295 --> 38:18.296
Not anymore.

38:20.950 --> 38:22.256
Because of the Blight.

38:26.304 --> 38:27.348
Her name was Preya.

38:28.436 --> 38:32.092
She was quiet,
and stuck to herself.

38:33.528 --> 38:34.877
But she always had my back.

38:38.968 --> 38:42.798
Then, one day she was gone.

38:43.973 --> 38:45.323
I'm so sorry.

38:45.975 --> 38:47.325
I saw you with Alex today

38:48.630 --> 38:49.892
holding your sister's hand

38:49.936 --> 38:52.155
while she fought
the same disease
my sister did.

38:53.983 --> 38:55.811
If I had just killed
Pestilence

38:56.334 --> 38:58.031
the Blight never
would have happened.

38:59.989 --> 39:01.426
Preya would still be alive.

39:01.991 --> 39:04.864
I would probably
do the same thing
if Alex were gone.

39:04.907 --> 39:06.213
You wouldn't.

39:06.648 --> 39:08.650
That's what makes you
who you are.

39:08.998 --> 39:10.348
We're going
to stop the Blight.

39:11.740 --> 39:13.699
We're gonna save your sister.

39:14.395 --> 39:15.353
Together.

39:24.840 --> 39:26.799
Winn, welcome back.

39:26.842 --> 39:28.235
Ah, against all odds.

39:28.453 --> 39:30.106
Where are we
with the Worldkillers?

39:30.150 --> 39:32.979
So, last time
you fought Purity
we managed to identify

39:33.022 --> 39:34.937
the frequency of the waves
that she emits.

39:35.285 --> 39:37.157
We put a tracker
on that specific frequency

39:37.200 --> 39:39.246
which should alert us
when it's present in...

39:39.289 --> 39:40.334
[beeping]

39:40.378 --> 39:42.031
-The city.
-[J'onn J'onzz] Already?

39:42.075 --> 39:43.293
She's on the move.

39:43.511 --> 39:44.860
Hopefully with Pestilence.

39:45.470 --> 39:46.471
[J'onn J'onzz]
Where is she heading?

39:46.514 --> 39:47.515
Toward L-Corp.

39:47.950 --> 39:48.951
Lena.

39:51.214 --> 39:52.215
Sam...

39:53.042 --> 39:54.392
Sam, I think
I found something.

39:58.352 --> 39:59.353
Sam?

39:59.701 --> 40:00.746
They're coming.

40:02.878 --> 40:05.359
Lena. Lena,
the Worldkillers are coming.

40:05.403 --> 40:08.406
We have to get you
somewhere... safe.

40:20.243 --> 40:21.244
What is this?

40:21.680 --> 40:22.681
I was gonna tell you.

40:23.943 --> 40:25.248
Tell me what?

40:26.728 --> 40:27.729
About me.

40:29.427 --> 40:30.428
Sam.

40:33.561 --> 40:35.650
[grunting and straining]

40:37.739 --> 40:38.740
[gasps]

40:50.709 --> 40:51.710
[sighs]

40:54.930 --> 40:56.236
[screaming]

41:07.465 --> 41:08.466
[grunts]

41:10.119 --> 41:11.599
[groaning]

41:26.614 --> 41:27.963
Finally.

41:36.319 --> 41:37.538
[all straining]

41:38.321 --> 41:39.801
El-may-arah.

41:55.600 --> 41:57.558
[theme music playing]
