00:07.640 --> 00:10.640
I always thought that white people
were bad kissers and it's not their fault,

00:10.720 --> 00:13.440
it's just that they've got really
small lips and they can't embrace

00:13.520 --> 00:16.360
the-the challenge of lips like mine
and then they try and compensate

00:16.440 --> 00:18.800
for the lack of lips with the tongue
and then the tongue ends up

00:18.880 --> 00:21.680
everywhere, just flapping about,
you get my drift? But Connor, he...

00:21.760 --> 00:22.640
[metallic clank]

00:29.600 --> 00:31.640
Hi. You all right?

01:11.800 --> 01:13.560
-What's his name?
-Connor.

01:13.640 --> 01:14.480
Full name.

01:14.560 --> 01:15.480
Connor grabbed my left boob.

01:15.560 --> 01:16.400
Does he have a job?

01:16.480 --> 01:18.160
Without dropping the left boob,
he went for the right.

01:18.240 --> 01:19.320
Why does it matter if he's got a job?

01:19.440 --> 01:22.680
-Does Connor have a girlfriend?
-Yeah, me.

01:22.920 --> 01:26.000
-You ain't even met his dick yet.
-Well, yeah, I have, so...

01:26.680 --> 01:29.240

-If he, if he, if he put it up me, yeah,

and then, like, just tied a knot
around itself and like strangled itself

01:38.480 --> 01:42.200
till it was dead.
That's how big... it was.

01:43.160 --> 01:44.040
Real talk.

01:45.160 --> 01:48.040
All right, tell me this, yeah?
Is he circumcised?

01:49.520 --> 01:50.440

a man your boyfriend.

Do you hear Karly Raven
got pregnant by a Somali?

02:16.520 --> 02:18.680

02:18.840 --> 02:21.360
Yeah, one of them pirate-looking
Somalians from Brick Lane.

02:21.480 --> 02:22.880
They look like pirates.

Oh!

02:45.400 --> 02:46.440
Fair enough, then.

02:47.440 --> 02:48.880
Are Somalians black?

02:48.960 --> 02:50.680
I've never been too sure.

02:50.800 --> 02:53.120
I suppose, there's various
different types of black.

02:53.480 --> 02:55.560
Somalis look a bit mixed
race, but, like...

02:56.320 --> 02:57.320
something went wrong.

02:57.840 --> 03:00.560
OK, see you on the estate.

You should see her son.

I don't why you're interrogating me.
Can you just give it to me? Please.

09:56.640 --> 09:58.920
You know, I-I-I didn't even
see the dick, you know.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.880

I ain't got a dick.

-I [stammers] don't know if

he's my partner yet.

I haven't-haven't confirmed it.
I'm going to confirm it, like, today,

10:10.960 --> 10:12.640
or next week. I'm going to confirm it.

10:12.720 --> 10:14.440
Why-Why are you shoutin' at me? I...

10:14.520 --> 10:15.360

10:25.920 --> 10:30.040

From thigh to toe it will return.

10:30.280 --> 10:32.000
The road to hell is wide,

10:32.240 --> 10:34.840
but the road to the Father is narrow.

10:34.960 --> 10:37.720
Keep your genitalia narrow also!

10:39.920 --> 10:43.320
I can't. She said we can't even use
tampons till we're married.

10:43.400 --> 10:47.240
If she knew there was sperm swimmin'
around my... uh, she'd have a stroke.

10:47.760 --> 10:48.640
Now...

10:49.600 --> 10:53.840
Should I tell Rashad
all my kinks or some of them?

10:53.920 --> 10:58.080
'cause, girlfriend, I have this kink
I'm a bit embarrassed about.

10:58.640 --> 11:00.000
Look, jus-just keep it to yourself.

11:00.600 --> 11:02.240
Isn't everyone shy about
that sort of thing?

11:02.440 --> 11:03.640
Thanks, babes.

11:04.720 --> 11:06.600
It's been a long time
since I felt up someone

11:06.680 --> 11:07.880
other than myself, you know?

11:08.960 --> 11:10.640
Keep Connor busy tonight, wouldn't ya?

11:11.400 --> 11:13.680
Mandy, I'm sorry about
what happened in the bedroom.

11:14.120 --> 11:17.360
That's nothin', babe.
If I had a penny for every girl

11:17.440 --> 11:20.360
that's hand-pumped his willy,
I'd have a fuckin' yacht!

11:21.280 --> 11:22.160
Er...

11:23.240 --> 11:25.960
You said he-he's never had a girlfriend.

11:26.200 --> 11:29.560
Well, he ain't, but he's got to empty
the trash into somethin', ain't he?

11:29.800 --> 11:31.800
And there's never been
a shortage of friendly girls

11:31.880 --> 11:34.480
to off-load his shit in,
if you know what I mean.

11:34.840 --> 11:35.680
[chuckles]

11:35.760 --> 11:37.040
Fornicators!

11:37.120 --> 11:38.360
Film watchers!

11:38.640 --> 11:40.040
Fashionistas!

11:40.600 --> 11:42.200
Single mothers!

11:42.360 --> 11:45.640
A demonic spirit is workin' in your life,

11:45.880 --> 11:49.840
leading you to the gangsters
and witch doctors of Tower Hamlets,

11:50.160 --> 11:55.200
giving them the last of your cash
monies for drugs and the disdain.

11:56.840 --> 11:59.800
<i>Big Leish is the queen of voodoo.</i>

12:00.120 --> 12:01.320
[police sirens blaring]

12:01.480 --> 12:04.800
<i>'She made one guy wake up</i>
<i>without a testicle.</i>

12:04.960 --> 12:07.960
They call her Turkish trader
of Tower Hamlets.

12:08.040 --> 12:10.200
It's hard core.

12:10.280 --> 12:11.920
[lady] Code word.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.400
[Tracey] Hello?

12:13.480 --> 12:15.160
Say the code word, fam.

12:15.520 --> 12:18.160
I don't know. I just need some drugs
to stop me getting pregnant.

12:18.240 --> 12:19.120
Correct.

12:23.720 --> 12:26.320
We [stammers] was just
talkin' on the phone,

12:26.400 --> 12:27.680
about the mornin'-after pill?

12:27.760 --> 12:28.640
Shh!

12:29.920 --> 12:30.920
Take the seat.

12:38.640 --> 12:40.400
Yeah, looking at the circumstances,

12:40.480 --> 12:42.400
you could definitely be pregnant.

12:43.280 --> 12:45.840
They can indeed swim from the leg

12:46.320 --> 12:48.000
into the vagina,

12:48.080 --> 12:48.920
upwards,

12:49.720 --> 12:51.280
like salmon really.

12:51.360 --> 12:53.960
And the father, he is...
I mean, he's never even had a girlfriend.

12:54.040 --> 12:56.000
-Shh-shh-shh!
-I'd be a single--

12:56.080 --> 12:59.400
Western medicine is too expensive,
too many side effects.

12:59.520 --> 13:03.440
I can get you original medicine
from my home country

13:03.520 --> 13:04.880
at a great discount.

13:05.080 --> 13:06.600
OK, OK, what is it?

13:06.680 --> 13:08.680
Calm down. What did I tell you?

13:08.760 --> 13:11.480
I-I don't know. None of it
makes any sense yet.

13:11.560 --> 13:12.880
I told you, "Shush."

13:13.760 --> 13:15.400
There is a plant, Tracey,

13:15.480 --> 13:18.360
found growing on highest
mountain in Turkey.

13:18.800 --> 13:21.440
-Takes about three weeks to ship but--
-I've only got three days.

13:21.520 --> 13:25.280
But, it exists in decent amounts

13:25.360 --> 13:29.200
in a cream I source,
at very reasonable price.

13:29.360 --> 13:31.040
OK, well, how much does it cost?

13:31.120 --> 13:32.440
£1,000. What?

13:32.520 --> 13:35.160
OK, get out, enjoy your baby.

13:35.240 --> 13:36.920
Look, I've only got £15 to my name.

13:37.000 --> 13:37.840
Deal!

13:45.240 --> 13:48.240
That's Anusol.
"Effective relief from piles."

13:48.560 --> 13:51.000
Can I have my money back, please?

13:51.080 --> 13:52.520
I'm not even finished, Tracey.

14:00.160 --> 14:03.600
This is for your bum,
and this is Diet Coke.

14:04.040 --> 14:04.920
What's your point, fam?

14:05.640 --> 14:07.800
How is this gonna
stop me getting pregnant?

14:08.120 --> 14:10.000
Rub on your belly, nine layers, this.

14:10.800 --> 14:12.720
Drink 12 sips, this.

14:13.080 --> 14:16.520
Two hours before or after,
please make sure you don't swim

14:16.600 --> 14:17.920
or touch a hairless animal.

14:18.600 --> 14:19.800
This is Anusol.

14:19.880 --> 14:21.560
Han-u-sol!

14:21.640 --> 14:23.240
Different thing in my country.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.840
-It's the same tube.
-Same tube, different thing!

14:34.480 --> 14:36.240
<i>Where are you?</i>

14:36.880 --> 14:39.400
-Tracey.
-I'm busy, sorry.

14:39.480 --> 14:40.400
Trace?

14:42.160 --> 14:44.280
I wrote you something, a poem, obviously.

14:44.360 --> 14:47.080
Don't big-deal it.
Just put it on the page, basically,

14:47.160 --> 14:48.720
'cause it's cathartic and that, basically.

14:48.800 --> 14:49.680
[Tracey] Hmm.

14:54.960 --> 14:57.560
"Look, there's a lonely cow

14:57.640 --> 14:59.520
Hey, cow! If I was a cow,

14:59.960 --> 15:02.480
That would be me until I met you

15:02.880 --> 15:05.000
So it therefore ain't me no more."

15:05.320 --> 15:06.680
I love cows.

15:07.280 --> 15:08.520
Uh, what do you think?

15:09.960 --> 15:12.840
I think, it's a lying cow.

15:13.200 --> 15:14.360
Wh-what-what do you mean?

15:14.440 --> 15:16.360
Well, I mean, it's-it's on a farm, right?

15:16.440 --> 15:18.520
There's probably bare cows.
It's not lonely.

15:18.760 --> 15:21.520
This cow is weird
but it's really good-lookin'.

15:21.600 --> 15:24.600
It's got so much milk, the milk's
just swimmin' up the leg of any cow

15:24.680 --> 15:27.760
that would just dare to-to m-moo.

15:28.240 --> 15:30.400
No, no. I'm the cow.

15:30.640 --> 15:32.240
Yeah, I think you're a lying cow.

15:33.120 --> 15:35.800
Yeah, your mum told me about the brothel

15:35.880 --> 15:37.040
of girls in your bedroom,

15:37.280 --> 15:40.760
and how I'm just another one, so
it's just better that I know now, innit?

15:41.080 --> 15:42.000
Mum...

15:43.200 --> 15:44.200
Mum!

15:44.520 --> 15:46.640
-Tracey!
-Don't chase me!

15:46.760 --> 15:48.320
This is not a film.

15:48.600 --> 15:49.480
Look.

15:53.360 --> 15:54.240
Oh!

15:58.440 --> 15:59.800
Nine layers.

16:00.840 --> 16:02.600
12 sips.

16:04.160 --> 16:05.720
Dear Our Blessed Saviour,

16:06.000 --> 16:08.080
I need the courage you had

16:08.320 --> 16:10.840
to tell them you were the Son of God.

16:13.920 --> 16:16.680
And I need the strength that you had

16:16.760 --> 16:20.080
to make the switch from R&B
to hip-hop when they doubted you.

16:24.800 --> 16:25.640
Amen.

16:30.520 --> 16:33.040
Two, three, four

16:33.120 --> 16:33.960
[can pops open]

16:45.600 --> 16:47.040
Got to piss already.

16:55.560 --> 16:58.800
It's-it's-its my period. It's my period!

17:00.320 --> 17:01.960
You got to have faith, yo.

17:02.440 --> 17:04.480
[gasps] He lives!

17:09.200 --> 17:12.000
You fuckin' dickhead.

17:12.160 --> 17:14.040
This is the dumbest thing
you've ever done.

17:14.280 --> 17:15.280
12 sips?

17:15.520 --> 17:17.520
I'm dead. I'm dead, I'm dead!

17:18.000 --> 17:21.760
You got your period 'cause your period
was fucking due, bruv!

17:22.000 --> 17:24.440
All of this could've been avoided
had you told me

17:24.520 --> 17:25.680
that Connor was a monster.

17:25.760 --> 17:27.160
-He's not.
-Yes, he is.

17:27.280 --> 17:28.320
His mum told me he's got girls

17:28.440 --> 17:30.280
passing through his bedroom
like water through a tap.

17:30.400 --> 17:32.520
He's a grown single man. What's the shame?

17:35.040 --> 17:37.360
-What?
-It's just, it's Ronald.

17:37.440 --> 17:39.960
What's he still messaging you for?
You ain't his business no more.

17:40.080 --> 17:42.000
Well, I'm still his girlfriend.

17:44.840 --> 17:47.360
No, no, he, he's not my boyfriend.

17:49.040 --> 17:50.120
What?

17:50.920 --> 17:53.360
She ain't even broken up with Ronald!

18:00.840 --> 18:02.520
Thanks, they're lovely.

18:05.440 --> 18:06.840
Just leave them in bin.

18:10.840 --> 18:13.480
-It takes more than flowers, Tracey.
-OK.

18:13.640 --> 18:15.280
I shouldn't have to hire a carer.

18:15.360 --> 18:16.920
That's why I have you as my girlfriend.

18:17.200 --> 18:19.080
Yeah, can we talk about that?

18:19.160 --> 18:21.600
Thankfully, I've already forgiven you
for leaving me for dead.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.400
It's the kind of Christian I am.

18:23.720 --> 18:27.720
So let's just try and regain
a sense of normalcy.

18:27.880 --> 18:30.160
OK, well, Ronald,
I want to break up with you.

18:30.880 --> 18:33.800
-Why?
-Wha-- You hate me.

18:34.800 --> 18:35.680
So?

18:35.920 --> 18:38.400
I think it's important to not hate
the person you're with, OK?

18:38.480 --> 18:41.160
I think you should just go
and find a girl that you like.

18:41.560 --> 18:43.360
I like you more
than I like all the others.

18:43.800 --> 18:44.680
Oh, sorry...

18:44.760 --> 18:46.480
Andy, no, no, come in, please.

18:48.120 --> 18:52.680
Look, Ron, Ron. I've met someone else. OK?

18:52.880 --> 18:53.760
Ron?

18:54.520 --> 18:55.400
Ron, it's over.

18:56.400 --> 18:59.360
OK. Yeah, whatever.

19:29.800 --> 19:30.680
Oh.

19:31.440 --> 19:34.120
I'm sorry, Mummy, it was just
never going to work out, OK?

19:34.200 --> 19:36.600
And I know you wanted us
to get married and stuff like that,

19:36.720 --> 19:38.280
but the thing is, Mum,
he'll never love me.

19:38.360 --> 19:40.200
He will never love any girl because he's--

19:40.280 --> 19:42.240
<i>My dear, can I speak now?</i>

19:42.560 --> 19:43.760
Yes, Mummy, I'm sorry.

19:43.920 --> 19:47.200
<i>You used wisdom and made a decision.</i>
<i>I'm proud of you,</i>

19:47.280 --> 19:48.920
<i>and happy you're OK.</i>

19:49.160 --> 19:51.080
<i>Dinner is here whenever you're hungry.</i>

19:51.240 --> 19:53.800
<i>Cynthia, come and sweep this ting!</i>

19:54.320 --> 19:56.040
[Connor] How come you didn't
buzz me, then?

19:56.720 --> 19:58.520
I put myself on the line for you.

19:58.600 --> 20:00.040
Where are you?

20:00.200 --> 20:01.920
[Connor] You can come to me this time.

20:03.840 --> 20:05.480
I'm in solitude.

20:22.720 --> 20:23.600
Ow!

20:28.640 --> 20:30.320
Is that that poem in there?

20:31.160 --> 20:32.000
No.

20:32.200 --> 20:33.280
OK, what's that?

20:34.520 --> 20:37.520
The Bible. Been tryin' to understand you.

20:38.600 --> 20:41.280
-I can see why you like this shit.
-I've never read it.

20:41.360 --> 20:43.680
I went to church since I was born,
so I don't really need it.

20:43.760 --> 20:46.520
See, your past confuses me
the same way mine does yours.

20:47.280 --> 20:48.600
You're not like other girls.

20:48.840 --> 20:51.560
It's not linear with you, you get me?

20:53.440 --> 20:56.360
Can we sit in, like,
your house or something?

20:57.840 --> 21:01.560
Yeah. Come on, then.
My mum's havin' a mate over.

21:01.680 --> 21:02.640
Rashad or--

21:02.760 --> 21:05.080
Nah, nah, nah, let's just stay in the bin.

21:08.320 --> 21:10.880
Do you want these? They weren't even open.

21:12.440 --> 21:14.440
All right, go on, then.

21:16.520 --> 21:18.080
Read some.

21:20.360 --> 21:21.920
"Give the king thy judgements.

21:22.200 --> 21:25.480
Jesus and the disciples
gave bread to the crowd

21:25.720 --> 21:29.160
and the entire multitude of 5,000
was fed with that small meal."

21:29.240 --> 21:31.880
You didn't say on your profile
that this is what you were into,

21:31.960 --> 21:34.120
-you know what I mean?
-Tummy, please!

21:36.000 --> 21:37.680
[chomping]

21:38.680 --> 21:40.560
Well, don't go all shy. Just get into it.

21:41.840 --> 21:43.520
-I want milk!
-Eh?

21:44.880 --> 21:46.640
Can I suck your tits?

21:47.800 --> 21:49.800
-I can't do this.
-Oh, fuck off!
