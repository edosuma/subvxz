02:54.497 --> 02:56.333
I didn't expect
to see you tonight.

02:57.300 --> 02:58.201
Same.

02:59.402 --> 03:01.904
Um, Donna asked
if I would take some photos

03:01.938 --> 03:03.540
of the improv show.

03:04.873 --> 03:07.243
I'm not stalking you
or anything.

03:09.712 --> 03:11.348
Did you play?

03:12.782 --> 03:13.951
Yeah.

03:14.750 --> 03:15.986
Yeah, I played.

03:18.420 --> 03:19.789
It's not as bad as you think.

03:21.023 --> 03:22.693
- It's not.
- You didn't see it.

03:22.958 --> 03:24.628
You're too hard on yourself.

03:42.010 --> 03:44.380
I'm sorry
for not calling you after...

03:46.081 --> 03:49.485
I should have called you
and I didn't.

03:49.518 --> 03:50.420
Oh.

03:51.653 --> 03:53.289
Um, ah...

03:54.022 --> 03:55.725
It's alright.

03:56.158 --> 03:58.494
I know you're really busy.

04:00.430 --> 04:03.033
You are busy, right?

04:03.866 --> 04:04.901
Yes.

04:05.534 --> 04:06.569
Very busy.

04:08.938 --> 04:09.839
Okay.

04:16.945 --> 04:18.648
This was a mistake.

04:20.048 --> 04:21.051
I should go.

04:24.387 --> 04:25.289
Okay.

04:57.520 --> 04:58.520
Focus on the future.

05:11.868 --> 05:13.403
Get away.

05:56.779 --> 05:58.782
Hey!

06:06.688 --> 06:09.392
A great show today.

06:11.027 --> 06:11.928
What?

06:12.928 --> 06:16.732
Um, your show,
the place with all the chairs.

06:17.133 --> 06:18.769
It was great. So...

06:21.770 --> 06:23.205
- What?
- Yeah.

06:23.238 --> 06:24.840
I saw the show
and I thought you were great,

06:24.873 --> 06:26.875
so I thought it would be okay
to just tell you

06:26.909 --> 06:29.111
that I saw the show
and that you were great.

06:29.145 --> 06:30.647
You were really great.
I just want you to know

06:30.679 --> 06:32.181
you were really great
at the show.

06:33.983 --> 06:35.085
You came to the show?

06:35.318 --> 06:37.454
- Um hmm.
- Why did you chase me?

06:37.486 --> 06:38.955
- What?
- Why did you chase me?

06:38.988 --> 06:40.824
You started running.

06:41.224 --> 06:44.794
I thought I wouldn't be able
to get you to say, "Good show."

06:44.827 --> 06:46.596
I was just waiting
to say, "Good show,"

06:46.628 --> 06:49.532
then I caught up to you
and I wanted to say "Good show."

06:49.565 --> 06:50.901
You're very fast.

06:53.669 --> 06:54.637
Jesus.

06:54.669 --> 06:56.138
Okay, I'm sorry.

06:57.005 --> 06:58.707
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

06:59.575 --> 07:01.777
It's fine. I'm Barnaby.

07:10.051 --> 07:11.554
Yeah...

07:14.657 --> 07:17.693
I should probably get going,
it's late, you know.

07:18.628 --> 07:19.830
But...

07:21.029 --> 07:23.532
It was real nice
to meet you, and...

07:24.032 --> 07:26.735
I just wanted
you to know that, um,

07:28.037 --> 07:29.673
you're a great man.

07:30.407 --> 07:35.678
Talented and courageous.
Just really great, so...

07:39.080 --> 07:40.616
Thank you for that.

07:41.284 --> 07:42.586
Okay.

07:44.219 --> 07:46.121
- Okay.
- Okay.

07:46.789 --> 07:48.690
Okay. Okay.

07:48.724 --> 07:49.993
It was good.

07:51.024 --> 07:51.593
Okay.

07:51.626 --> 07:52.561
So, just...

07:52.594 --> 07:56.866
Okay.

07:58.099 --> 07:59.101
Okay.

08:00.870 --> 08:01.771
Okay.

08:48.083 --> 08:49.652
Did you play?

09:29.357 --> 09:30.827
Hey, this is Barney Bates

09:30.860 --> 09:32.161
from the sketch group
Fart Squad Five.

09:32.193 --> 09:33.895
I've just got a text from Vince

09:33.928 --> 09:35.365
saying he was cancelling
the drinks meeting

09:35.398 --> 09:36.899
we had set for tonight,

09:36.932 --> 09:38.267
and I was just calling
let you guys know

09:38.299 --> 09:41.136
that we are available
for rescheduling

09:41.169 --> 09:43.673
whenever it works best
for Vince.

09:43.706 --> 09:45.108
We can come to him,

09:45.140 --> 09:46.409
or if he wants to meet us
somewhere,

09:46.442 --> 09:48.077
we can meet somewhere else.

09:48.110 --> 09:49.379
We are very flexible,

09:49.411 --> 09:50.679
and we'd love
to make this happen.

09:50.712 --> 09:53.182
This is very important for us.

09:53.215 --> 09:54.717
We would love
to make this happen.

09:54.750 --> 09:56.019
So, give me a call.

09:56.052 --> 09:59.022
I will be available 24/7
for you guys.

09:59.054 --> 10:02.291
I will make sure my phone is on
and in my pocket at all times.

10:02.592 --> 10:05.895
Just really want this to happen.

10:06.462 --> 10:08.631
Okay, thanks so much.
Bye.

10:16.005 --> 10:16.905
Shit!

10:34.055 --> 10:35.658
I can't.

10:42.164 --> 10:43.466
Okay, Fart Squad.

10:43.499 --> 10:46.302
Today's focus
is on million hit ideas.

10:46.334 --> 10:48.370
If we can't generate
at least a million views,

10:48.404 --> 10:50.239
I don't want to waste time
talking about it.

10:50.271 --> 10:52.842
Thursday to do list:
9:00 a.m. sketch group.

10:52.875 --> 10:55.977
But what if we have an idea
that only we think is fun?

10:56.010 --> 10:58.847
Fame and fortune first, Zoe,
then we can start having fun.

10:58.880 --> 11:00.449
10:30 screenwriting.

11:00.482 --> 11:03.752
Hook.

11:03.785 --> 11:06.088
We need to be able to sell
these scripts in a single line.

11:06.121 --> 11:08.290
If I can't pitch this
in an elevator,

11:08.323 --> 11:09.758
it's not worth pitching.

11:09.792 --> 11:11.360
Twelve thirty, sketch marketing.

11:11.393 --> 11:13.229
We want to be taken seriously.

11:13.261 --> 11:14.930
Okay, we want agents

11:14.963 --> 11:17.065
not to cancel on us last minute
for no reason.

11:17.098 --> 11:19.401
It's never gonna happen
if we're walking around town

11:19.434 --> 11:21.938
with Fart Squad Five
t-shirts on.

11:23.239 --> 11:24.941
Did you get a whole box of them?

11:24.973 --> 11:26.443
2:00 p.m. Improv.

11:33.348 --> 11:34.850
Hey, you're back.

11:34.884 --> 11:36.119
Yeah,
I had a big meeting

11:36.151 --> 11:37.953
I had to cancel,
so I have some time.

11:37.986 --> 11:40.089
- I'll use it to my advantage.
- Great.

11:40.423 --> 11:43.025
Listen, Barnaby, you know,

11:43.058 --> 11:46.294
you've taken this workshop
half a dozen times,

11:46.327 --> 11:49.399
and I haven't seen you
get off the back line once.

11:49.966 --> 11:51.768
Improv's not for everybody.

11:51.800 --> 11:53.902
No, I'm fine. I just need reps.

11:54.636 --> 11:58.808
Okay, you can do
whatever you want. It's $20.

12:04.480 --> 12:06.149
Okay, guys,
it's about three o'clock,

12:06.182 --> 12:08.116
so we'll just go ahead
and get started.

12:08.150 --> 12:10.819
Oh, my God.

12:11.120 --> 12:13.155
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

12:13.188 --> 12:15.091
I'm okay. How are you?

12:15.824 --> 12:17.159
I'm fine.

12:17.193 --> 12:18.761
What?

12:18.995 --> 12:22.130
Are you here for the workshop?

12:22.164 --> 12:23.967
Mm.

12:25.934 --> 12:28.404
Okay, well, it's $20.

12:28.437 --> 12:29.371
Okay.

12:41.516 --> 12:44.286
I'm sorry it's crumbled.
I bought it.

12:48.189 --> 12:49.457
- Okay.
- Okay.

12:49.491 --> 12:51.126
- What's your name?
- What?

12:51.159 --> 12:52.361
What is your name?

12:52.394 --> 12:53.496
My name's Copper.

12:53.529 --> 12:56.131
Copper. Like the metal.

12:56.164 --> 12:57.900
- Okay.
- Yeah?

12:58.134 --> 12:59.601
How do you spell your last name?

12:59.635 --> 13:01.169
What?

13:01.202 --> 13:02.605
Can you please spell
your last name for me?

13:02.638 --> 13:06.843
Okay. Yeah. F E N C I N G.

13:08.476 --> 13:10.413
- Copper Fencing?
- Hello.

13:13.915 --> 13:15.484
Okay, uh...

13:17.252 --> 13:18.821
Take a seat.

13:38.039 --> 13:40.476
Okay, today to begin,

13:40.509 --> 13:43.613
we are going to be doing
a world building exercise.

13:50.720 --> 13:52.255
<i>Improv's not for everybody.</i>

13:52.288 --> 13:53.489
<i>Did he play?</i>

14:05.100 --> 14:06.903
What is your deal?

14:24.419 --> 14:26.289
He's climbing the tree.

14:31.526 --> 14:33.195
He's eating cake.

14:39.568 --> 14:43.273
What are you doing?
What are you looking for?

14:51.246 --> 14:52.148
What is that?

15:03.625 --> 15:05.695
What the hell is that?

15:42.731 --> 15:45.000
I shouldn't be following him.

15:46.668 --> 15:48.571
Okay.

17:06.214 --> 17:07.183
Hello?

17:44.186 --> 17:45.388
Hey.

17:54.897 --> 17:57.233
Ow.

18:01.536 --> 18:02.572
Don't be mad at me.

18:05.640 --> 18:07.243
I shouldn't have been
at the show,

18:07.275 --> 18:09.210
I shouldn't have gone.
Like, it's my fault.

18:09.244 --> 18:11.213
So, it's all my bad,
so, I'm sorry for that.

18:11.246 --> 18:12.480
- I'm sorry for doing...
- No, you're fine.

18:12.514 --> 18:14.449
Everything's fine. Listen.

18:14.483 --> 18:16.619
I don't care
about any of this stuff, okay?

18:16.651 --> 18:18.453
It doesn't matter.
Nothing matters.

18:18.486 --> 18:20.456
We're good. We're fine, okay?

18:21.390 --> 18:22.658
Hey...

18:23.859 --> 18:25.328
You were following me, right?

18:26.628 --> 18:28.331
- No!
- No...

18:28.730 --> 18:31.366
Hey, it's crazy
how similar we are.

18:31.632 --> 18:34.370
It was kinda like
I'm looking in the mirror.

18:34.402 --> 18:36.706
I was following you too, so...

18:37.073 --> 18:38.841
You probably put it
together, right?

18:39.207 --> 18:40.775
Who I am
and what I'm doing here?

18:40.809 --> 18:43.546
I didn't
put anything together.

18:43.579 --> 18:46.883
Okay, I didn't put
anything together.

18:47.382 --> 18:49.518
I didn't put anything together.

18:49.919 --> 18:52.388
Hey, you don't know who I am?

18:53.287 --> 18:54.756
I don't know who you are.

18:54.790 --> 18:56.592
You don't have to tell me
anything.

18:56.624 --> 18:58.527
Isn't it obvious?

18:59.695 --> 19:01.164
I'm your son.

19:03.864 --> 19:08.236
Yeah, you're my son.
Totally. Yes.

19:08.669 --> 19:10.839
Absolutely.
I should have seen that.

19:10.871 --> 19:14.677
I know that that sounds crazy.
I'm too old to be your son.

19:14.709 --> 19:16.477
Hey, it's crazy,

19:16.511 --> 19:19.382
but there's a perfectly
reasonable explanation for that.

19:20.314 --> 19:21.516
I'm from the future.

19:22.817 --> 19:25.553
I believe you.

19:25.586 --> 19:28.256
I believe you're my son
from the future.

19:28.290 --> 19:32.962
Now let dad go,
and I will leave here, okay?

19:33.928 --> 19:35.230
That's you, right?

19:39.434 --> 19:41.737
The guy in the picture.
It's you, isn't it?

19:41.969 --> 19:43.938
I don't know
what that is.

19:43.971 --> 19:44.940
Oh.

19:45.640 --> 19:46.775
Um...

19:48.576 --> 19:51.279
I've had this picture
for as long as I can remember.

19:52.046 --> 19:53.915
My mother left it for me.

19:54.448 --> 19:57.320
She told them to tell me
that the man in the picture,

19:57.953 --> 20:00.923
the man in that jacket
with his head turned,

20:02.490 --> 20:04.292
that that was my father.

20:04.325 --> 20:05.694
So, um...

20:05.995 --> 20:07.830
There is some writing
on the back,

20:07.862 --> 20:10.932
like a scribble,
a name and a date.

20:11.632 --> 20:12.500
And...

20:13.334 --> 20:14.569
I know
I shouldn't have gone there,

20:14.602 --> 20:16.272
I know it was a mistake, but...

20:17.572 --> 20:19.441
I just had to see, so...

20:24.979 --> 20:25.981
Okay, listen.

20:27.381 --> 20:29.818
You need to let me go, okay?

20:30.186 --> 20:33.554
You need to let me go right now,
because I cannot die.

20:33.588 --> 20:34.923
I have a lot of things

20:34.956 --> 20:36.492
that I still need to do
with my life.

20:36.525 --> 20:38.460
Oh no, you don't,
you're okay.

20:38.893 --> 20:40.262
No, I... What?

20:40.696 --> 20:41.964
Look, I'm gonna let you go,

20:41.996 --> 20:43.731
because I don't know
what else to do.

20:43.765 --> 20:45.367
And I really got to stop
talking,

20:45.400 --> 20:47.569
because people will get
real angry at me,

20:47.601 --> 20:49.405
but just so you know,

20:49.438 --> 20:51.974
if there's anything
you want to do,

20:52.006 --> 20:55.710
with your life, I mean,
you should do it soon,

20:56.611 --> 20:58.813
'cause you've only got, like,
ten months left.

21:00.015 --> 21:00.916
What does that mean?

21:06.053 --> 21:08.524
Okay, nap time now.

21:08.556 --> 21:09.457
What?

21:36.951 --> 21:38.953
- Don't freak out.
- What!

21:41.922 --> 21:43.491
What are you doing here?

21:43.525 --> 21:44.659
I needed to talk to you

21:44.692 --> 21:45.993
and you're not answering
my texts.

21:46.026 --> 21:48.063
Okay. How did
you get in the apartment?

21:48.831 --> 21:50.498
You still leave this
under the mat.

21:50.532 --> 21:51.734
So, really, that's on you.

21:51.766 --> 21:53.101
Okay, you got to go.

21:53.134 --> 21:54.936
No, Barnaby, listen to me.
We need to talk.

21:54.969 --> 21:56.871
- Not now.
- This can't wait.

21:57.906 --> 21:59.742
- It's not safe.
- I'm pregnant.

22:15.524 --> 22:16.425
What?

22:22.997 --> 22:24.900
I tried to tell you last night.

22:25.600 --> 22:26.802
I tried.

22:31.105 --> 22:32.073
It's yours.

22:36.210 --> 22:37.145
We haven't...

22:37.813 --> 22:39.081
We haven't been together since...

22:39.113 --> 22:40.783
The last time we...

22:40.815 --> 22:43.585
Before last night.
The last time before last night.

22:45.152 --> 22:47.855
I know this is the last thing
you want to hear right now,

22:47.889 --> 22:49.925
and I'm not asking you
for anything.

22:52.092 --> 22:53.795
But I'm keeping this baby.

22:53.829 --> 22:55.731
And I thought you deserve
to know.

23:05.774 --> 23:07.042
Say something.

23:12.246 --> 23:13.948
Barnaby, say something.

23:17.084 --> 23:18.787
Say something!

23:20.855 --> 23:22.891
Did you ever develop
those photos?

23:24.025 --> 23:24.927
What?

23:26.127 --> 23:29.031
From your camera
the other night at the show?

23:29.063 --> 23:30.498
Do you have them?

23:32.766 --> 23:34.669
What does that have to do
with anything?

23:36.505 --> 23:37.872
Do you have them?

23:51.852 --> 23:53.456
Never finished the roll.

24:03.230 --> 24:04.866
There's no way.

24:09.571 --> 24:10.706
I gotta go.

24:10.738 --> 24:13.042
Barnaby, where are you going?

24:13.775 --> 24:14.776
Barnaby!

25:40.361 --> 25:41.764
What is this?

25:42.863 --> 25:44.566
What the hell is going on?

25:46.767 --> 25:48.703
It's long story, you know.

25:50.138 --> 25:51.640
Is that cake?

25:54.809 --> 25:57.678
So, at some point,
like ten months from now,

25:57.711 --> 25:59.948
there's going to be
a big disaster.

25:59.980 --> 26:01.717
Something real bad

26:01.749 --> 26:03.384
that wipes out all of the plants
and people and things.

26:03.418 --> 26:05.087
Okay, what kind of disaster?

26:06.053 --> 26:08.122
- What?
- What kind of disaster?

26:08.156 --> 26:10.192
Oh, I don't know.

26:10.792 --> 26:14.630
Okay. He doesn't know.
Well, who's responsible for it?

26:14.662 --> 26:17.298
Oh, I don't know.

26:17.564 --> 26:19.034
- You don't know?
- Hmm mm.

26:19.066 --> 26:20.368
Why don't you know?

26:20.401 --> 26:22.705
Oh, they don't really
tell us much.

26:23.237 --> 26:26.741
Most days I just sit in my cell
waiting, so...

26:27.109 --> 26:28.644
That isn't very good.

26:28.677 --> 26:30.612
- I don't believe you.
- Okay.

26:32.781 --> 26:33.983
Okay, that's...

26:35.184 --> 26:36.718
Won't you try to convince me
you're telling me the truth?

26:36.751 --> 26:37.853
Oh, I am.

26:37.886 --> 26:39.688
Okay, well, I don't believe you.

26:39.720 --> 26:41.957
- Okay.
- Stop saying "Okay."

26:41.989 --> 26:43.057
Okay.

26:43.757 --> 26:47.095
I mean... alright.

26:49.764 --> 26:51.132
Hey, you want to see
my time machine?

27:13.955 --> 27:15.057
How does it work?

27:15.090 --> 27:17.192
Oh, it's just simple, actually.

27:17.225 --> 27:18.794
You just close
this main door here,

27:18.826 --> 27:20.327
and then you take
some of the black rocks

27:20.361 --> 27:22.097
and you put it in
with green rocks.

27:22.130 --> 27:24.131
And then it takes you back
to the moment you left.

27:24.165 --> 27:26.735
but, like, a few seconds
forward, which is nice.

27:26.767 --> 27:29.236
Right, but like time travel,
how does time travel work?

27:29.269 --> 27:31.973
Oh, how does time travel work?
Sure, a great question.

27:32.439 --> 27:33.976
Not really sure.

27:34.442 --> 27:36.911
It's space crystals
or something, I think.

27:36.945 --> 27:38.213
That's what Barry said, so...

27:40.814 --> 27:44.218
- Space crystals? Or something?
- What?

27:44.252 --> 27:46.221
Space crystals or something?

27:46.254 --> 27:47.488
What?

27:47.522 --> 27:49.256
Do you have frustrating this is?

27:49.290 --> 27:50.792
- No.
- You're a time traveler.

27:50.824 --> 27:52.259
You've traveled through time.

27:52.293 --> 27:54.228
But you don't know anything
about anything.

27:54.696 --> 27:57.765
You don't know anything
about the future or time travel.

28:01.803 --> 28:02.803
Sorry, Dad.

28:02.836 --> 28:04.739
Don't call me Dad.

28:04.773 --> 28:05.807
Right, sorry.

28:05.840 --> 28:07.309
Stop apologizing for everything.

28:07.342 --> 28:09.445
Right, sorry. I mean, okay.

28:10.544 --> 28:11.447
Alright.

28:22.290 --> 28:24.426
- Let's go back inside.
- That's where my cake is.

28:24.458 --> 28:26.327
I can't believe
this is happening.

28:26.361 --> 28:28.397
This can't be happening
right now.

28:29.363 --> 28:32.400
I shouldn't have let him in.
He's like a homeless fisherman.

28:32.767 --> 28:35.036
With a dead body in his house.

28:36.804 --> 28:38.841
He showed me his time machine.

28:39.507 --> 28:41.976
I wonder if he's telling
the truth?

28:52.352 --> 28:53.354
We have to stop it.

28:53.388 --> 28:55.290
Okay. Yeah, absolutely.

28:56.190 --> 28:57.860
What are we talking about?

28:59.326 --> 29:00.928
I don't know.

29:00.961 --> 29:02.496
The thing that will wipe
out half of civilization.

29:02.530 --> 29:04.966
We have to figure out
what's gonna make it happen

29:04.998 --> 29:06.367
and not let it happen.

29:06.400 --> 29:09.170
Okay. How do we do that?

29:10.604 --> 29:13.074
I don't know. I have no idea.

29:18.079 --> 29:19.848
But I think I know some people
that can help.

29:19.880 --> 29:22.918
Okay, Fart Squad,
new concept I want to workshop.

29:23.251 --> 29:24.953
How do we save the future?

29:24.986 --> 29:26.188
I don't get it.

29:26.521 --> 29:28.490
- Same.
- We should get coffee.

29:28.523 --> 29:29.991
Oh, yeah, coffee.

29:30.024 --> 29:32.194
No, no coffee.
Listen, focus, okay.

29:32.526 --> 29:34.261
Think of it as like
an interactive experience.

29:34.294 --> 29:35.863
Right?

29:35.897 --> 29:37.165
We're gonna give the viewers
a scenario,

29:37.198 --> 29:39.266
like an end of the world
scenario, right?

29:39.300 --> 29:41.203
With a limited amount
of information, right?

29:41.236 --> 29:43.103
And then they're gonna use
those specifics

29:43.137 --> 29:44.973
to try to figure out
how to save the future.

29:45.005 --> 29:46.842
So, it's kind of like
an escape room?

29:46.874 --> 29:48.175
Or a murder mystery.

29:48.208 --> 29:49.476
Sure. Yeah.
Just like those things.

29:49.509 --> 29:51.212
Oh, that can be fun.

29:51.513 --> 29:53.849
Hey, who's that?

29:58.319 --> 30:00.289
Him? Don't worry about him.
He's industry.

30:01.389 --> 30:04.159
Ooh... Industry.

30:04.792 --> 30:07.495
So, the kid comes back
from the future

30:07.527 --> 30:09.096
and tells you
the world's gonna end?

30:09.130 --> 30:11.099
Yeah, that's the end
of the first act, right.

30:11.131 --> 30:13.034
And I'm trying to brainstorm
what to do next.

30:13.066 --> 30:15.002
Like, I know that they save
the future, right?

30:15.035 --> 30:16.871
They're gonna save the future.

30:16.905 --> 30:19.474
I just don't know how to get
from point A to point B.

30:19.506 --> 30:20.507
Any thoughts?

30:20.541 --> 30:22.977
What if the kid just knows

30:23.011 --> 30:24.646
how to save the future.
Something simple like that?

30:24.678 --> 30:28.048
Can't do it. First act's locked.
The specifics are what they are.

30:28.082 --> 30:29.016
Why?

30:29.050 --> 30:30.519
I don't know, Frankie.

30:31.151 --> 30:33.020
Because I want to make
my life difficult.

30:33.053 --> 30:35.556
Can you just not be part
of the problem?

30:35.590 --> 30:36.491
Wow.

30:37.691 --> 30:39.660
Well, why is the kid
traveling through time?

30:39.694 --> 30:40.896
What's his purpose?

30:40.928 --> 30:42.264
Copper. Go ahead.

30:42.296 --> 30:43.597
- Me?
- Yeah.

30:43.630 --> 30:46.034
Okay. Hello.
What was your question?

30:46.066 --> 30:47.635
Why is he traveling
through time?

30:47.669 --> 30:48.669
Oh, he's on a mission.

30:48.703 --> 30:50.005
What kind of mission?

30:50.037 --> 30:53.240
Oh, a cleanup, mostly.

30:53.274 --> 30:54.909
Do you mean metaphorically,

30:54.942 --> 30:57.578
like, he has to clean up
people's past mistakes?

30:57.611 --> 30:59.346
Oh, um...

30:59.380 --> 31:02.484
No, it's more like bodies,
like dead human bodies.

31:04.252 --> 31:05.387
I don't follow.

31:05.419 --> 31:06.521
- Stop.
- Okay.

31:06.553 --> 31:08.390
Okay. Alright.

31:08.422 --> 31:10.357
The way it was pitched to me
was that there's two groups.

31:10.390 --> 31:14.428
There's these bad assassin guys
and then their cleanup crews,

31:14.461 --> 31:17.198
and the assassin guys come back
to take out specific targets.

31:17.230 --> 31:18.933
Well, who are these targets?

31:18.967 --> 31:21.136
Are they like the leaders
of the rebellion force

31:21.169 --> 31:22.403
in the future?

31:24.237 --> 31:26.373
We don't know.
and it doesn't matter, right?

31:26.407 --> 31:28.376
These assassins, they come back
for whatever reason,

31:28.409 --> 31:30.544
and then they take out targets,

31:30.578 --> 31:32.480
and then they leave the bodies

31:32.513 --> 31:34.115
for the cleanup crews
to dispose of.

31:34.148 --> 31:35.183
What do you mean, dispose of?

31:35.216 --> 31:37.319
Oh, he means we cut them up,

31:37.351 --> 31:40.688
or we burn or we bash them,
and we bury them.

31:40.721 --> 31:42.389
Whatever it takes to make sure

31:42.422 --> 31:44.092
people don't ever find
a single piece of them.

31:44.124 --> 31:45.526
You know what I mean?

31:45.560 --> 31:46.727
Does anyone want a cookie?
I have cookies.

31:46.761 --> 31:48.430
I didn't say anything.

31:48.463 --> 31:51.366
Okay, so your protagonist
is like a time janitor.

31:52.265 --> 31:54.069
Time janitor... That's catchy.

31:54.101 --> 31:56.004
Yeah, super catchy.
The catchiest.

31:56.336 --> 31:58.038
How does it help us
save the future?

31:58.072 --> 32:00.342
How do the janitors know
where to pick up the bodies?

32:00.374 --> 32:02.409
Do the assassins call them,
or something?

32:02.442 --> 32:07.081
No, it's in his bag with cards.
Red and green cards.

32:07.415 --> 32:09.217
They're laminated.
That's why they're hard.

32:09.249 --> 32:10.986
And what are the cards for?

32:11.018 --> 32:13.587
Okay, so the green ones
are places to be,

32:13.621 --> 32:15.622
times, places, and people,

32:15.656 --> 32:17.659
and red ones are places
never to be,

32:17.691 --> 32:19.193
times, places and people.

32:19.226 --> 32:21.329
Do the time assassins
get cards too?

32:21.361 --> 32:23.398
Oh, time assassins, that's good.

32:23.430 --> 32:26.133
Is it good?
Does that help us at all?

32:26.801 --> 32:28.169
Do they have cards?

32:28.201 --> 32:30.237
- I...
- I'm worked up.

32:30.271 --> 32:31.438
- Do they have cards?
- No.

32:31.471 --> 32:33.107
Okay, they don't
have cards. Cool.

32:33.541 --> 32:36.011
Okay, where do they get
their information from?

32:36.044 --> 32:37.611
Oh, they just know stuff.

32:37.644 --> 32:39.680
Okay, well, what if you
captured one of them?

32:39.714 --> 32:41.316
That's smart.

32:41.349 --> 32:43.217
Wait, what's smart?
What did I just miss?

32:43.251 --> 32:45.053
She's saying if you know when
and where the time assassins

32:45.085 --> 32:47.354
will drop off their targets,
then theoretically,

32:47.388 --> 32:49.224
you could get there beforehand
and ambush them.

32:49.256 --> 32:50.726
Get your answers directly.

32:51.059 --> 32:53.628
Yeah, exactly. Does that work?

32:54.695 --> 32:56.031
Does it?

32:57.798 --> 33:01.101
Okay, so two days from now
assassin guy's gonna come,

33:01.134 --> 33:02.236
and drop off a body.

33:02.269 --> 33:03.804
Right.

33:03.838 --> 33:05.607
We'll ambush him.
Get our answers directly.

33:06.274 --> 33:07.175
Yeah...

33:08.074 --> 33:10.211
I'm not sure about that.

33:12.447 --> 33:13.348
What do you mean?

33:13.380 --> 33:15.216
Don't be mad.

33:15.248 --> 33:18.585
I'm just saying,
they tell us never to do this.

33:18.619 --> 33:20.688
It's one of the things they say
never to do.

33:20.720 --> 33:22.323
They say that,

33:22.355 --> 33:24.491
so I just don't want anyone
get mad at me,

33:24.525 --> 33:25.826
or be upset or angry.

33:25.860 --> 33:27.661
Hey, we're a team, right?

33:28.696 --> 33:30.499
- What?
- We are a team.

33:31.631 --> 33:34.302
- We're a team?
- Oh, yeah, absolutely.

33:35.169 --> 33:36.537
I need you.

33:37.438 --> 33:39.274
You need me?

33:39.806 --> 33:41.275
Are you kidding me?

33:41.309 --> 33:43.345
I can't save the future
by myself.

33:43.644 --> 33:45.146
I need you to help me.

33:45.514 --> 33:47.649
- You need me to help you?
- Oh, yeah.

33:47.681 --> 33:50.518
If we're gonna save it,
we gotta save it together.

33:51.651 --> 33:52.821
- Okay.
- Alright?

33:52.853 --> 33:54.621
Yeah, okay. Yeah, together.

33:54.655 --> 33:57.158
We're gonna save,
and we'll do it together.

33:57.190 --> 33:58.325
Oh, yeah.

33:59.226 --> 34:00.594
- As a team.
- Yeah.

34:00.628 --> 34:01.729
- Okay.
- Alright.

34:01.762 --> 34:03.098
- Okay.
- Good.

34:03.130 --> 34:04.065
Okay.

34:06.266 --> 34:07.535
Just two days.

34:08.069 --> 34:09.771
What do we do
till then?

34:09.803 --> 34:12.239
Nothing. We just lay low.

34:12.472 --> 34:13.541
Stay out of sight.

34:14.306 --> 34:16.143
Can we do more improv?

34:18.545 --> 34:20.281
Want to do more improv?

34:20.313 --> 34:23.217
Oh, yeah, I mean, yeah,
it's just at class...

34:23.251 --> 34:25.120
The lady was...

34:25.152 --> 34:27.288
No, yeah, no.

34:27.320 --> 34:29.289
I don't want to explain
where you come from or anything.

34:29.322 --> 34:30.690
- Yeah.
- Too complicated.

34:30.724 --> 34:32.192
It's really complicated.
I get that.

34:32.226 --> 34:34.262
- Yeah.
- I don't want to be complicated.

34:41.400 --> 34:44.606
Hey, can I ask you something,
or are you asleep already?

34:45.072 --> 34:47.308
No, that's fine. What?

34:48.608 --> 34:49.811
All that paper...

34:51.945 --> 34:54.380
- The stacks of paper.
- My screenplays?

34:55.349 --> 34:56.684
Oh, okay.

34:59.586 --> 35:01.456
Do you know what that is?

35:01.488 --> 35:02.923
- What?
- You know what that is?

35:02.956 --> 35:04.659
- What?
- The screenplay.

35:05.092 --> 35:06.494
- No.
- It's a story.

35:07.095 --> 35:09.297
- Okay.
- I write stories.

35:09.329 --> 35:11.765
Oh, okay. That's what
the tall stacks are.

35:11.798 --> 35:13.333
- Um hmm.
- Okay.

35:13.367 --> 35:14.436
Okay.

35:15.635 --> 35:16.803
Did your parents write stories?

35:16.836 --> 35:17.871
Is that why you did it?

35:17.905 --> 35:19.640
Like, your parents wrote stories

35:19.673 --> 35:21.575
and then you write stories,
is that why?

35:21.608 --> 35:23.610
No, my parents
never wrote stories.

35:23.644 --> 35:25.346
- Okay.
- We should get some sleep, okay?

35:25.378 --> 35:26.914
Yeah, okay.

35:26.947 --> 35:28.382
- Good night.
- Good night.

35:28.416 --> 35:29.551
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

35:29.584 --> 35:31.252
Floor feels good.

35:31.285 --> 35:32.187
Okay.

35:36.923 --> 35:38.860
But like, what do you mean?

35:40.894 --> 35:42.597
Are you mad at me?

35:42.630 --> 35:44.231
- No, I'm not mad.
- You just seem mad.

35:44.264 --> 35:45.732
I just wanted to add,
it's making sense to me.

35:45.765 --> 35:47.901
You said you wrote stories,
and then...

35:47.934 --> 35:50.470
but your parents didn't,
but they don't care.

35:50.503 --> 35:52.973
I just didn't understand that.
So, I'm sorry.

35:53.006 --> 35:54.675
- Okay.
- Okay.

35:55.175 --> 35:57.311
Listen,
my mom wasn't around.

35:57.345 --> 35:58.613
And my dad was miserable.

35:58.646 --> 35:59.914
- Okay. Yeah.
- Okay?

35:59.947 --> 36:01.883
- Okay.
- Um, okay.

36:03.784 --> 36:05.552
So, you're just going
to sleep, right?

36:05.586 --> 36:07.354
- Yeah.
- Okay. Yeah.

36:09.490 --> 36:11.492
I'm gonna ask you something
tomorrow, okay?

36:11.525 --> 36:13.427
- No.
- It's okay.

36:13.461 --> 36:14.896
You want to sleep.
It's okay to sleep.

36:14.928 --> 36:16.764
I just want to ask you
something tomorrow, okay?

36:16.796 --> 36:18.599
What?

36:18.633 --> 36:21.236
Just don't get mad at me.
So I'll ask you tomorrow, okay?

36:21.269 --> 36:23.271
- Just ask me now.
- What?

36:23.303 --> 36:26.541
- Just asked me now.
- I know you want to sleep.

36:26.573 --> 36:28.610
- Just ask me now.
- Are you sure?

36:28.642 --> 36:30.410
Okay.

36:30.443 --> 36:32.746
When you say he was miserable,
what do you mean by that?

36:32.780 --> 36:33.848
Okay, listen...

36:34.381 --> 36:36.551
- He wanted to be an actor.
- Right.

36:36.584 --> 36:38.386
- Alright? He went to New York.
- Okay.

36:38.418 --> 36:40.354
He studied with a great teacher.

36:40.387 --> 36:43.290
And he tried to do it.
And he wasn't successful.

36:43.323 --> 36:45.459
- Okay.
- And then he blamed me for it.

36:45.693 --> 36:48.830
- For not being a success.
- Okay.

36:48.863 --> 36:50.565
Because he had
to take care of me.

36:50.597 --> 36:52.300
- Okay.
- Can we go to bed?

36:52.332 --> 36:53.767
- Yeah.
- Alright, great.

36:53.800 --> 36:55.836
Well, like,
that's what parents do, right?

36:56.236 --> 36:58.673
Like, they take care
of their kid. That's it.

36:58.706 --> 37:00.842
- Yeah, that's what they do.
- Okay.

37:02.642 --> 37:03.811
I'm sorry.

37:19.559 --> 37:20.762
You don't have to be sorry.

37:20.794 --> 37:24.432
Listen,
there's a class tomorrow.

37:24.465 --> 37:26.501
Another class,
if you want to go.

37:26.534 --> 37:27.669
We can do that.

37:27.702 --> 37:28.602
Yeah.

37:29.102 --> 37:31.305
- Yeah, I would love that.
- Okay.

37:31.338 --> 37:32.939
- Thanks, Dad.
- Don't call me Dad.

37:32.972 --> 37:34.675
Okay, yeah, I get it.

37:36.410 --> 37:38.446
Good. Everybody
see what she's doing?

37:38.479 --> 37:39.914
Okay? Now...

37:39.947 --> 37:42.450
Add to the stage picture.

37:42.483 --> 37:43.818
Great. Next.

37:48.456 --> 37:50.959
Alright. Great. Okay.

37:51.659 --> 37:52.593
Where are we?

37:53.427 --> 37:55.296
Copper? Where are we?

37:58.832 --> 38:01.401
Hey, can I ask you something?

38:01.434 --> 38:04.639
- Sure.
- How do you do it?

38:05.106 --> 38:06.374
Do what?

38:06.407 --> 38:07.342
Improv.

38:07.374 --> 38:08.909
I don't really.

38:08.943 --> 38:11.012
Okay. It's just
I've seen you do it.

38:11.044 --> 38:13.648
So, it's like, what are
you talking about?

38:14.514 --> 38:15.916
I get on stage a bunch,

38:15.950 --> 38:18.953
but I never really step off
off the backline.

38:19.787 --> 38:22.457
What does that mean,
step off the back line?

38:24.124 --> 38:25.726
In an improv scene,

38:25.760 --> 38:27.095
if you are standing
against the back wall,

38:27.827 --> 38:29.096
and never leave it,

38:29.130 --> 38:30.832
that's never getting off
the back line.

38:30.865 --> 38:33.067
So, you're not really in a scene

38:33.099 --> 38:35.069
till you step off the back line
and play.

38:35.570 --> 38:37.604
Which I have a problem with.

38:38.072 --> 38:38.972
Hi.

38:39.907 --> 38:41.508
- Hello.
- I'm Hannah.

38:41.976 --> 38:43.811
- Okay.
- Barnaby.

38:44.111 --> 38:45.680
Oh, yeah, I've seen you before.

38:45.713 --> 38:47.381
You're on the Team
Diarrhea Dance party?

38:47.782 --> 38:49.117
Yeah, I am.

38:49.150 --> 38:50.617
But I've never seen
you around before.

38:50.651 --> 38:51.953
What's your name?

38:51.985 --> 38:54.388
- Copper.
- Are you on any teams?

38:54.421 --> 38:56.023
- Teams?
- Yeah, like improv teams.

38:56.055 --> 38:58.425
Oh, no.

38:58.459 --> 39:00.495
Do you come
to shows here a lot?

39:00.827 --> 39:03.730
I saw a show. My dad played it.

39:03.764 --> 39:05.432
I have a show tonight.
Butt Lumps.

39:05.465 --> 39:06.900
It's at eight o'clock.

39:06.934 --> 39:09.070
Hosted by the Orlasi Brothers.
Do you know them?

39:09.102 --> 39:10.972
The Orlasi Brothers...

39:11.939 --> 39:13.707
- No.
- Well, they're great.

39:13.740 --> 39:16.677
The show's got free beer
and water, candy.

39:16.709 --> 39:18.746
You should come.
You both should.

39:18.778 --> 39:21.548
It's very nice of you,
but we have plans.

39:21.581 --> 39:25.519
Okay, well, you can still come
if your plans fall through,

39:25.552 --> 39:27.755
or, like, if you don't want
to be where he is.

39:27.787 --> 39:30.992
I'll be here anyway.
Nice meeting you, Copper.

39:31.025 --> 39:32.126
It's nice to meet you, too.

39:32.159 --> 39:33.827
I left my soup in there.

39:33.860 --> 39:35.896
I'll go get it. Bye.

39:36.963 --> 39:38.166
- Bye.
- Bye.

39:38.698 --> 39:39.767
Bye.

39:41.936 --> 39:44.138
- What was that?
- I have no idea.

39:44.171 --> 39:46.207
But we should probably
avoid her going forward,

39:46.240 --> 39:48.476
and the underground too,
just to be safe.

39:48.508 --> 39:49.776
Okay, yeah.

39:49.809 --> 39:51.178
We'll just...
Whatever you think, Dad.

39:51.211 --> 39:53.747
We'll just avoid her
and the underground.

39:53.780 --> 39:55.749
Sounds good.
Let's do that.

39:59.052 --> 40:01.588
We could do something else,
if you want.

40:01.622 --> 40:03.892
- Whatever you want.
- Can I meet my mother?

40:04.959 --> 40:07.895
Or we can go to that show, yeah.

40:07.927 --> 40:09.196
- Okay.
- Yeah.

40:09.229 --> 40:11.032
We should just clean
you up first.

40:11.064 --> 40:12.666
To avoid suspicion.

40:12.700 --> 40:14.101
Okay. Clean me up.

40:14.133 --> 40:15.769
Hi Zoe, it's Barnaby.

40:15.802 --> 40:18.171
Listen, I'm gonna be busy
for the next few days

40:18.204 --> 40:19.706
working on projects.

40:19.740 --> 40:21.142
Very hush hush.
Can't talk about it.

40:21.175 --> 40:23.177
If you want to get a hold of me,
just text me.

40:23.209 --> 40:24.579
Okay, bye.

40:30.950 --> 40:32.753
I'll leave some clothes
out here for you

40:32.785 --> 40:34.188
on the chair, okay?

40:34.220 --> 40:35.755
Thanks, Dad.

40:35.789 --> 40:37.459
Don't call me Dad.

40:44.298 --> 40:46.767
I'm sorry, I didn't hear
the last part you said.

40:47.901 --> 40:49.037
Just...

40:50.070 --> 40:51.671
- It's cool.
- Okay.

40:51.704 --> 40:53.207
I'm gonna go back in.

40:54.275 --> 40:55.610
<i>♪ I'm getting clean ♪</i>

41:16.764 --> 41:18.198
Alright.

41:21.769 --> 41:24.104
I studied
really hard for it.

41:24.137 --> 41:28.775
I did a lot of research
and I credited all my sources.

41:28.809 --> 41:32.113
You did,
I know one source,

41:32.479 --> 41:36.851
and the quote you took
from that source

41:36.883 --> 41:39.954
took up nine of the ten pages
of your essay.

41:39.986 --> 41:42.557
Well, it was just
a really long quote,

41:42.590 --> 41:46.026
and I felt that it was
pertinent information

41:46.059 --> 41:48.295
to what the essay was about.

41:48.996 --> 41:52.934
You've got me there.

41:58.271 --> 42:01.007
Alright. Don't forget to throw
some money in the bucket.

42:01.041 --> 42:01.943
Hi.

42:03.376 --> 42:05.746
This is gonna sound crazy,
but my whole team bailed on me.

42:05.778 --> 42:08.181
- Will you guys play?
- No.

42:08.215 --> 42:10.617
Please, it would mean
so much to me.

42:10.918 --> 42:12.019
No.

42:12.686 --> 42:15.121
Hey, guys,
we're Last Minute Mistakes.

42:15.155 --> 42:16.823
We're gonna do some
improv for you.

42:16.856 --> 42:18.625
All we need is a word, please.

42:18.659 --> 42:20.794
- Time.
- Time, thanks.

42:23.162 --> 42:25.365
Honey, you're home late.

42:25.398 --> 42:27.234
Are you cheating on me?

42:29.802 --> 42:30.704
Honey?

42:31.639 --> 42:33.274
Honey, come out
into the bedroom, please.

42:33.307 --> 42:34.842
You're home so late.

42:34.874 --> 42:36.610
Just tell me,
are you cheating on me?

42:37.144 --> 42:38.046
Honey!

42:38.546 --> 42:40.147
Honey, you're coming home
so late.

42:40.180 --> 42:41.649
Are you cheating on me?

42:42.081 --> 42:43.750
- Are you...?
- Yes, you.

42:43.784 --> 42:44.785
Come out.

42:46.186 --> 42:49.122
- Okay.
- Yes. A little more.

42:50.423 --> 42:52.793
A little more. It's okay.

42:54.160 --> 42:55.262
Yes. Thank you.

42:55.595 --> 42:57.197
Come have a conversation
with me.

42:57.231 --> 42:58.698
Okay.

42:58.731 --> 43:00.735
Now you've just got home
so late.

43:01.102 --> 43:02.970
What's going on?
Are you cheating on me?

43:03.003 --> 43:05.305
- No.
- No? Then what were you doing?

43:07.340 --> 43:08.742
Nothing.

43:08.776 --> 43:10.077
Well, I called your office

43:10.110 --> 43:11.144
and your boss said
you weren't there.

43:11.177 --> 43:12.380
What?

43:12.412 --> 43:13.680
Your boss.
You weren't at work.

43:13.713 --> 43:15.181
Okay.

43:15.215 --> 43:16.917
You weren't there late.
So where were you?

43:16.950 --> 43:18.119
- I'm gonna go back.
- No, wait.

43:18.151 --> 43:19.820
- Were you with Karen?
- What?

43:19.852 --> 43:21.421
Were you with Karen,
your secretary?

43:21.454 --> 43:23.056
I don't know who Karen is.

43:23.090 --> 43:24.191
Oh, my God.

43:25.358 --> 43:27.160
- Then where were you?
- What?

43:27.193 --> 43:29.796
Where were you
if you weren't cheating on me?

43:29.829 --> 43:32.365
Just... what were you doing?
Just anything?

43:32.398 --> 43:34.067
I don't know what you want.

43:34.101 --> 43:36.169
He doesn't know
what you're asking him.

43:39.006 --> 43:40.274
Because he's from the future.

43:45.244 --> 43:47.914
- What? You're from the future.
- Uh huh.

43:48.347 --> 43:49.916
Why didn't you tell me?

43:49.950 --> 43:51.686
He told me not to.

43:51.718 --> 43:54.054
Oh, my God.
I don't know what to say.

43:54.088 --> 43:56.390
I knew there was something
different about you.

43:56.890 --> 43:59.193
Ask him something
about the future.

43:59.226 --> 44:00.695
What's it like
in the future?

44:00.727 --> 44:01.729
It's weird.

44:02.829 --> 44:04.898
No one talks to you
and they all smell like shoes.

44:07.867 --> 44:11.304
Hey, why did you tell Barnaby
and you didn't tell me?

44:11.838 --> 44:13.740
Because I'm his father.

44:25.218 --> 44:27.487
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

44:27.521 --> 44:29.856
- It was good, right?
- It was great.

44:29.889 --> 44:31.758
- Yeah.
- It was great.

44:31.791 --> 44:33.860
That was amazing.
Thank you so much.

44:33.894 --> 44:35.062
You saved my life.

44:35.095 --> 44:36.263
- Yeah?
- No big deal.

44:36.296 --> 44:37.998
Yeah, no biggie.

44:38.030 --> 44:40.066
What are you guys doing now?
You want to get a drink?

44:40.099 --> 44:42.002
Is that something we can do?

44:43.070 --> 44:44.272
Yeah, why not?

44:45.072 --> 44:46.207
- Okay.
- Cool.

44:47.441 --> 44:49.711
I think
that's my favorite show.

44:50.278 --> 44:53.914
- It was a good show.
- Did you like it?

44:56.615 --> 44:59.086
- Did you enjoy tonight?
- Um hmm.

44:59.454 --> 45:00.955
- Is that it?
- What?

45:00.988 --> 45:03.024
Is that all you can say?

45:03.523 --> 45:05.358
- No.
- Okay, what else?

45:05.392 --> 45:06.927
- What?
- What else do you have to say?

45:06.959 --> 45:08.795
- Okay.
- Okay, that's fine.

45:08.829 --> 45:10.363
- You're very sweet.
- Okay.

45:10.396 --> 45:13.500
Okay.

45:14.468 --> 45:16.270
Hey Copper,
I'm going to get another beer.

45:16.302 --> 45:17.438
Want to come to the kitchen
with me?

45:18.405 --> 45:20.807
Okay, I'm going to get a beer
with my Dad.

45:20.840 --> 45:22.108
Okay, I'll be here.

45:22.142 --> 45:23.477
- Come back.
- I will.

45:27.180 --> 45:29.082
Hey, she likes you.

45:29.349 --> 45:31.117
- What?
- Hannah, she really likes you.

45:31.151 --> 45:34.422
Danny didn't hiss one time...
At all. It was great.

45:35.155 --> 45:36.224
Why?

45:36.691 --> 45:39.026
- Does it matter?
- No.

45:41.093 --> 45:43.231
- What do I do?
- What do you want to do?

45:43.664 --> 45:45.800
I want to try to hold her hand.

45:46.900 --> 45:48.968
- Why?
- Why is it funny?

45:49.001 --> 45:50.371
Why do you want
to hold her hand?

45:50.403 --> 45:51.871
Have you ever held
anyone's hand before?

45:51.905 --> 45:53.474
- Of course.
- I haven't.

45:54.941 --> 45:56.342
Okay.

45:56.376 --> 45:57.845
There's nothing like
it where I come from.

45:57.878 --> 45:59.513
I see people doing it
in the park

45:59.546 --> 46:01.549
all that time,
and I've always wanted to try.

46:01.581 --> 46:03.483
Okay, so try to hold her hand.

46:03.517 --> 46:04.852
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

46:08.088 --> 46:09.490
- This is crazy.
- Okay.

46:09.722 --> 46:11.358
- Alright. Come on.
- Okay.

46:11.390 --> 46:13.427
...a crazy few days.
My mom's going nuts.

46:13.459 --> 46:16.463
And I go back in for
producer notes on Wednesday.

46:16.496 --> 46:18.331
That's amazing.

46:18.365 --> 46:19.400
Thank you.

46:19.432 --> 46:20.501
What did we miss?

46:20.534 --> 46:22.068
Kerry sold a script.

46:22.102 --> 46:24.472
Wow. Congratulations.

46:25.206 --> 46:27.541
I don't know
if I introduced myself.

46:27.573 --> 46:28.976
Sorry, I'm Barnaby.

46:29.008 --> 46:30.945
- Oh, Kerry.
- Nice to meet you.

46:30.977 --> 46:32.546
- Nice to meet you, too.
- I'm also a writer.

46:32.579 --> 46:33.981
Oh, really,
where're you repped?

46:34.014 --> 46:35.249
I'm not repped right now.

46:35.282 --> 46:37.318
But my sketch team
has a lot of heat

46:37.351 --> 46:39.586
and I have a meeting
with Vince from the LA Group.

46:39.619 --> 46:41.554
Oh, that's a great agency.

46:41.588 --> 46:43.524
I know.
What's your movie about?

46:43.557 --> 46:45.593
Oh, can I give you my pitch?

46:45.825 --> 46:46.961
Please.

46:47.526 --> 46:50.298
Lights, camera, money.

46:50.664 --> 46:52.365
We open on...

47:35.374 --> 47:36.943
<i>I couldn't do it.</i>

47:38.177 --> 47:39.313
Why not?

47:39.845 --> 47:42.282
I was scared, you know.

47:42.316 --> 47:45.019
Like, why would she want
to hold my hand, right?

47:45.052 --> 47:48.289
Like, who am I? I'm nobody.

47:48.322 --> 47:49.990
You know, like...

47:50.023 --> 47:51.959
I don't even have
a real name, so...

47:54.528 --> 47:57.265
I should probably give you
these clothes back, too.

47:58.131 --> 47:59.500
You don't have to.

47:59.532 --> 48:01.168
It's okay.
I don't want to mess them up.

48:01.200 --> 48:03.436
I'll just give them back to you.
That's okay.

48:04.570 --> 48:06.172
Can I ask you something?

48:06.206 --> 48:07.341
Yeah.

48:08.675 --> 48:10.644
How did you meet my mom?

48:12.678 --> 48:14.414
It's a long story.

48:14.447 --> 48:16.015
Were you scared?

48:16.048 --> 48:17.383
I was terrified.

48:17.416 --> 48:19.152
How did you do it?

48:19.186 --> 48:21.421
I didn't. She did.

48:22.255 --> 48:23.624
What do you mean?

48:24.523 --> 48:26.693
We were on an improv
team together,

48:26.727 --> 48:28.195
and we would practice here,

48:28.227 --> 48:30.063
and then one day
she just didn't leave.

48:30.097 --> 48:31.532
Didn't leave?

48:32.164 --> 48:34.434
Yeah, everyone left, and then...

48:34.468 --> 48:35.970
She just sat down
at my kitchen table

48:36.003 --> 48:37.571
and started talking to me

48:37.604 --> 48:39.674
like that wasn't the strangest
thing in the whole world.

48:40.673 --> 48:42.509
We talked all night long.

48:42.910 --> 48:44.545
That sounds wonderful.

48:44.977 --> 48:48.316
It was.
She was. She was great.

48:50.117 --> 48:52.119
Just sweet, easy to talk to.

48:53.720 --> 48:55.957
We spent a lot of time together.

48:56.323 --> 48:58.092
So, what happened?

48:59.026 --> 49:00.561
Craziest thing.

49:01.128 --> 49:04.164
I just started wanting
to spend all my time with her.

49:06.066 --> 49:08.069
That's what I knew
it had to end.

49:09.735 --> 49:10.971
Why?

49:14.807 --> 49:16.709
'Cause I didn't come out here
to meet a girl.

49:16.742 --> 49:19.145
I came here to be successful.

49:26.586 --> 49:29.523
We should get some rest.
We have a big day tomorrow.

49:31.124 --> 49:32.593
Save the future.

49:34.360 --> 49:35.662
Together?

49:37.430 --> 49:39.066
Yeah, together.

50:05.291 --> 50:07.027
<i>This was a mistake.</i>

50:09.563 --> 50:10.798
<i>I should go.</i>

50:17.671 --> 50:18.672
<i>Okay.</i>

50:28.514 --> 50:29.449
What time are you scheduled

50:29.483 --> 50:31.084
to pick up the body?

50:31.117 --> 50:34.188
After dark,
like any time after dark.

50:34.854 --> 50:36.823
So, he could show up
any time before then?

50:36.856 --> 50:39.325
Yeah. Any time before then.

50:41.494 --> 50:42.662
Okay.

50:44.497 --> 50:46.666
Oh, what's he gonna look like?

50:46.700 --> 50:47.801
Um...

50:47.834 --> 50:50.137
He'll be messy. Like me.

50:51.438 --> 50:53.340
We're trying to blend in,
you know?

50:53.372 --> 50:54.641
He could be any one
of these guys.

50:55.508 --> 50:56.876
The homeless guys?

50:56.910 --> 51:00.214
Oh yeah,
75% of all homeless people

51:00.247 --> 51:03.451
are really just time travelers
waiting to start their mission.

51:05.184 --> 51:06.653
How do we pick them out?

51:07.419 --> 51:08.588
It won't be hard.

51:15.561 --> 51:17.397
Hey.

51:40.787 --> 51:44.892
Hey, what's happening?
Where am I?

51:45.224 --> 51:47.861
Okay, I'm gonna ask
the questions here, asshole.

51:48.195 --> 51:49.430
How do we stop it?

51:51.363 --> 51:52.666
Stop what?

51:53.166 --> 51:54.635
The terrible thing
that wipes out

51:54.668 --> 51:56.269
most of civilization.

51:56.302 --> 51:58.605
I want to know what it is
and how we stop it.

51:59.805 --> 52:01.641
I was just looking
for some food.

52:01.675 --> 52:03.177
Alright, I'm...

52:04.644 --> 52:05.779
I was just hungry.

52:05.811 --> 52:07.647
Hey, I know who you are.

52:07.680 --> 52:10.316
What? No, you can't.

52:10.684 --> 52:15.723
My name is Jay Casey.
I am from Arlington.

52:16.155 --> 52:19.893
I have a family. I got kids.

52:20.193 --> 52:22.595
You don't want to do this.

52:22.628 --> 52:24.597
That's not true.

52:26.332 --> 52:28.869
Time assassins aren't allowed
to have families.

52:32.738 --> 52:34.874
Just like cleanup crews
can't, so...

52:34.907 --> 52:36.342
It's a lie.

52:37.477 --> 52:38.779
What have you done?

52:38.811 --> 52:40.514
- What?
- Hey, don't talk to him.

52:40.546 --> 52:41.548
Talk to me.

52:43.749 --> 52:45.585
Hey, Barnaby...

52:47.419 --> 52:49.689
I don't have to talk to you.

52:50.222 --> 52:52.927
Where I'm from,
you're already dust.

52:58.264 --> 53:00.400
And now, so are you.

53:05.338 --> 53:06.907
That's right. Focus on the guy

53:06.939 --> 53:08.809
that will keep spraying you
in the face with bleach

53:08.842 --> 53:10.410
until you answer his questions.

53:10.443 --> 53:11.979
Now, how do we stop it?

53:14.046 --> 53:15.849
How do we stop it?

53:17.784 --> 53:19.686
How do we stop it?

53:21.988 --> 53:24.425
- You can't.
- Why not?

53:25.291 --> 53:28.661
Because if you try
and change anything,

53:29.528 --> 53:32.832
you will destroy everything.

53:32.865 --> 53:34.968
What do you mean
destroy everything?

53:36.503 --> 53:37.604
Paradox.

53:38.706 --> 53:40.740
- What's a paradox?
- They're bad.

53:41.273 --> 53:45.378
They made us run drills,
paradox drills, all the time,

53:45.412 --> 53:46.981
in case we ever get stuck
in one.

53:48.747 --> 53:49.849
Explain!

53:50.717 --> 53:52.285
That won't help.

53:52.885 --> 53:54.354
Try me.

53:55.421 --> 53:56.789
Okay.

53:59.858 --> 54:02.729
Time is like a stack of bricks.

54:03.664 --> 54:07.301
Each moment stacked
one on top of the other,

54:07.334 --> 54:08.035
like a wall.

54:09.336 --> 54:11.572
And the wall's
already been built.

54:12.305 --> 54:15.809
Every second in existence
is already perfectly placed.

54:16.642 --> 54:18.911
Past, present, future.

54:20.546 --> 54:23.349
So, if you go back
and you try to change something,

54:24.351 --> 54:25.952
if you try to move a brick,

54:27.419 --> 54:28.722
the whole wall

54:28.755 --> 54:31.358
could come crashing down
around you.

54:32.057 --> 54:35.461
That's why time travel's
so dangerous.

54:36.061 --> 54:39.432
That's why you can't go back
and change anything.

54:40.499 --> 54:43.503
But you travelled through time.
You change things.

54:43.535 --> 54:46.673
It's a calculated risk.

54:47.474 --> 54:48.842
And the laminated cards

54:48.874 --> 54:50.910
tell us where to be
and where not to be.

54:50.943 --> 54:52.746
You stick to the greens.

54:52.778 --> 54:54.447
Changes are minor.

54:54.713 --> 54:57.717
But if you interact with anyone
on a red card,

54:58.050 --> 55:01.354
there's no telling
how much damage could be done.

55:02.255 --> 55:04.758
Bullshit.
You're just trying to scare us.

55:05.191 --> 55:08.062
Well, you should be scared.

55:09.028 --> 55:12.498
Time isn't a toy
to be played with by children.

55:14.501 --> 55:16.870
Changing things is dangerous.

55:17.436 --> 55:20.873
This conversation is dangerous.

55:21.941 --> 55:25.645
Every moment the three of us
spend in the same room together

55:25.677 --> 55:28.748
is a second that time
never could have anticipated.

55:31.584 --> 55:33.120
We could be changing things
right now

55:33.153 --> 55:35.956
and I'd be the only one
who'd know the difference.

55:39.592 --> 55:40.693
Why?

55:42.695 --> 55:43.831
Why what?

55:44.131 --> 55:45.165
Why would you
be the only one

55:45.197 --> 55:46.966
that would notice a change?

55:50.769 --> 55:52.672
His bracelet.

56:00.447 --> 56:02.483
Don't do it. Don't...

56:04.050 --> 56:07.053
If you try,
you could kill us all.

56:08.688 --> 56:10.856
He's an idiot. He's a nothing.

56:10.889 --> 56:13.059
That nothing is my son.

56:17.130 --> 56:19.432
- We have to test it.
- What?

56:19.865 --> 56:21.133
To see
if what he's saying is true

56:21.166 --> 56:22.902
or if he's just trying
to scare us.

56:22.936 --> 56:25.104
- How do we do that?
- Simple.

56:25.137 --> 56:27.072
He said if we interact
with anyone on a red card,

56:27.106 --> 56:28.775
it will cause a paradox, right?

56:28.807 --> 56:30.476
- Right.
- Well, let's do that.

56:30.510 --> 56:32.813
Let's interact with one
and see what happens.

56:37.082 --> 56:38.684
I got his bracelet.

56:38.718 --> 56:40.888
I've got a red card.
What else do we need?

56:41.889 --> 56:43.856
- A phone book.
- What if we're wrong?

56:43.889 --> 56:45.592
We're not wrong.

56:46.425 --> 56:48.961
- But what if we are?
- I'm concentrating.

56:48.994 --> 56:49.896
Okay.

56:56.503 --> 56:58.205
- In case.
- For what?

57:00.006 --> 57:01.608
What's it feel like?

57:02.809 --> 57:03.910
It tingles.

57:04.776 --> 57:06.914
Messerly... We got them.

57:07.680 --> 57:08.648
What?

57:08.680 --> 57:10.015
Miles Messerly, right?

57:10.048 --> 57:11.884
First name on the card.

57:11.918 --> 57:14.086
It's the only one in this book.
This has got to be him.

57:14.119 --> 57:15.021
What do we do?

57:16.155 --> 57:17.224
Let's give him a call.

57:19.191 --> 57:20.561
<i>We have to be touching.</i>

57:21.660 --> 57:22.896
What?

57:22.928 --> 57:25.231
Oh, well,
the bracelet protects you,

57:25.264 --> 57:28.133
you and anyone you're touching,
skin to skin.

57:28.166 --> 57:29.802
- Does that make sense?
- Yeah.

57:29.836 --> 57:33.139
But everyone else
in the world is at risk, okay.

57:33.171 --> 57:35.775
So, if a paradox happened
and we weren't touching,

57:35.807 --> 57:38.077
the bracelet,
and then skin to skin.

57:38.378 --> 57:40.613
I don't know what could happen,
you know?

57:40.646 --> 57:43.082
I could become a dog,
or fall through the wall,

57:43.115 --> 57:44.217
or just stop existing
altogether.

57:44.249 --> 57:46.552
Like, anything's possible.

57:46.785 --> 57:48.153
- Yeah.
- Skin to skin.

57:48.186 --> 57:50.089
Yeah, okay.

57:53.092 --> 57:54.227
Take my arm.

57:55.128 --> 57:57.097
Okay.

57:57.130 --> 57:58.999
- Okay?
- Yeah.

58:06.606 --> 58:07.975
What's with the cake?

58:09.709 --> 58:12.546
Oh, it's a test.

58:12.811 --> 58:14.547
If you call someone
on a red card

58:14.581 --> 58:16.316
and this cake
stops being this cake,

58:16.349 --> 58:18.285
then we know a paradox
has happened,

58:18.318 --> 58:20.020
because we changed something.

58:20.052 --> 58:21.587
Call it the cake test.

58:21.621 --> 58:23.624
It doesn't matter.
It's not a big deal.

58:30.829 --> 58:32.098
Skin to skin.

58:32.932 --> 58:34.067
Skin to skin.

58:35.834 --> 58:36.903
Alright, let's do this.

58:44.610 --> 58:45.578
It's ringing.

58:48.648 --> 58:49.550
Ah... Hello.

58:50.650 --> 58:52.552
Is this Miles Messerly?

58:53.186 --> 58:54.354
The cake's still cake.

58:54.387 --> 58:57.856
Oh, great. How's your day, sir?

58:57.889 --> 59:00.026
- The cake's okay.
- Hang on a moment.

59:01.327 --> 59:03.796
- Maybe you should talk to him.
- What?

59:03.829 --> 59:06.566
Something different may happen
if you talk to him.

59:06.900 --> 59:08.869
- What do I say?
- It doesn't matter.

59:09.936 --> 59:11.138
Okay.

59:15.207 --> 59:17.010
Hi, um...

59:18.144 --> 59:20.013
Why do you think
you're on the red cards?

59:20.046 --> 59:21.348
Cake's still cake.

59:21.381 --> 59:23.083
- We should check the door.
- What?

59:23.115 --> 59:24.717
- What?
- Check the door?

59:24.751 --> 59:26.586
Oh, hold on one second.

59:27.287 --> 59:29.155
So, a paradox can happen
real fast,

59:29.188 --> 59:30.657
or can take a long time,

59:30.689 --> 59:31.791
depending on how much
is changing.

59:31.823 --> 59:32.825
Okay?

59:32.858 --> 59:34.259
Okay, so why the door?

59:34.293 --> 59:35.894
I remember them telling
the assassins once

59:35.927 --> 59:37.363
if you walk through a door

59:37.396 --> 59:38.998
and you end up in a place
you weren't expecting,

59:39.032 --> 59:40.734
that means that paradox
is happening.

59:40.767 --> 59:43.003
Like it's still happening,
you know what I mean?

59:43.035 --> 59:44.704
What do you if that happens?

59:45.137 --> 59:46.805
Find another door.
Go through it.

59:46.838 --> 59:48.407
Keep doing that until you end up

59:48.441 --> 59:49.943
back in the place you started.

59:49.976 --> 59:51.644
If you do that,

59:51.677 --> 59:53.112
then you know you're saved
and the paradox is over.

59:53.146 --> 59:55.816
And then you check to make sure
the cake's okay.

59:56.182 --> 59:57.918
Alright, so we
should check the door?

59:59.785 --> 01:00:01.188
We're going to check the door.

01:00:05.057 --> 01:00:05.958
Okay.

01:00:05.992 --> 01:00:07.326
We're going to go for the door
in three.

01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:08.428
Okay.

01:00:08.461 --> 01:00:11.765
One... two... three...

01:00:19.037 --> 01:00:20.273
It's the same.

01:00:21.206 --> 01:00:22.409
It's all the same.

01:00:22.441 --> 01:00:23.976
What does that mean?

01:00:24.577 --> 01:00:27.314
It means your friend
was full of shit.

01:00:28.146 --> 01:00:29.382
Everything's fine.

01:00:36.354 --> 01:00:38.691
How long before anyone notices
he's missing?

01:00:40.026 --> 01:00:42.663
I'm not sure.
Maybe like a week.

01:00:43.162 --> 01:00:45.164
The next pick up
probably isn't for a week,

01:00:45.197 --> 01:00:46.932
so maybe like a week.

01:00:46.965 --> 01:00:49.201
Okay. That's good.

01:00:49.836 --> 01:00:50.937
Yeah.

01:00:50.970 --> 01:00:52.706
That'll give us plenty of time.

01:00:52.738 --> 01:00:53.939
Yeah, absolutely.

01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:57.043
For what?
What are we talking about?

01:00:57.343 --> 01:00:58.912
To get him to talk.

01:01:04.784 --> 01:01:06.720
Why is Tom calling me right now?

01:01:07.352 --> 01:01:09.021
Hey, stay right here.

01:01:10.990 --> 01:01:12.793
Hey, what's up?

01:01:14.026 --> 01:01:14.995
What?

01:01:16.195 --> 01:01:17.164
When?

01:01:18.363 --> 01:01:21.034
No, I can't.
I'm in the middle of something.

01:01:22.901 --> 01:01:27.273
Okay. Alright, stop. Fine.
I'll be there in 20 minutes.

01:01:28.775 --> 01:01:30.510
Yeah, I'll be there
in 20 minutes.

01:01:30.543 --> 01:01:31.878
Bye.

01:01:33.246 --> 01:01:34.914
Hey, I gotta go.

01:01:36.381 --> 01:01:38.284
- What, go?
- Yeah.

01:01:38.316 --> 01:01:40.820
Something came up,
so just stay with him.

01:01:42.954 --> 01:01:45.925
- Alone?
- Yeah, you'll be fine.

01:01:46.425 --> 01:01:48.061
I'll be gone for an hour.

01:01:48.093 --> 01:01:49.896
If something happens,
just knock him out again.

01:01:49.928 --> 01:01:51.930
Keep doing that till I get back.

01:01:51.963 --> 01:01:53.499
You can do that, right?

01:01:54.066 --> 01:01:57.336
- Yeah. I can do that.
- Okay.

01:01:57.803 --> 01:01:59.972
Wait, what are you doing?

01:02:00.006 --> 01:02:01.808
I gotta save my future.

01:02:12.251 --> 01:02:14.521
Where have you been?
I've been texting you for hours.

01:02:14.553 --> 01:02:16.322
I turned my phone off.
What's going on?

01:02:16.354 --> 01:02:18.291
That idiot guy submitted us
to the Crank Network.

01:02:18.323 --> 01:02:19.892
Yeah, but why?

01:02:19.925 --> 01:02:21.260
I don't know,

01:02:21.293 --> 01:02:23.395
but I guess some big gig
opened up at Crank

01:02:23.428 --> 01:02:25.932
and he thought we'd be perfect,
so he submitted us.

01:02:25.965 --> 01:02:27.467
It doesn't make any sense.

01:02:27.499 --> 01:02:29.202
He never even sat down with us.
He cancelled the meetings.

01:02:29.235 --> 01:02:30.937
I know,
but I guess he sent over

01:02:30.970 --> 01:02:33.173
a bunch of sketches,
they liked what they saw,

01:02:33.206 --> 01:02:35.809
because we've got a pitch
meeting tomorrow at noon.

01:02:36.541 --> 01:02:38.076
Noon tomorrow?

01:02:38.110 --> 01:02:39.845
It's crazy fast.

01:02:39.878 --> 01:02:41.847
We'll set up a conference call
tomorrow with Vince

01:02:41.881 --> 01:02:43.283
so we can all get
on the same page,

01:02:43.316 --> 01:02:45.151
and then he's gonna meet us
over at Crank,

01:02:45.184 --> 01:02:47.287
and then we'll all sit down
with the VP of development.

01:02:47.887 --> 01:02:50.055
I can't believe
this is happening right now.

01:02:50.088 --> 01:02:51.557
That's what we said.

01:02:51.590 --> 01:02:53.526
This is it, everything
we've been waiting for.

01:02:53.793 --> 01:02:55.894
He sent contracts
for all of us to look at.

01:02:55.927 --> 01:02:57.596
Yours on is the box of T-shirts.

01:02:57.630 --> 01:02:59.465
Vince wants anything
we can give him,

01:02:59.497 --> 01:03:01.900
so sketches, concepts,
character ideas.

01:03:01.934 --> 01:03:03.436
This is awesome.

01:03:03.468 --> 01:03:05.905
I need the HD files,
I'll cut together a sizzle reel.

01:03:05.938 --> 01:03:07.307
Do you have the hard drive?

01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:09.309
I gave it to Zoe
like a month ago.

01:03:09.342 --> 01:03:10.443
Who?

01:03:11.477 --> 01:03:12.912
Zoe, she wanted
to fix up her website,

01:03:12.945 --> 01:03:14.447
so she has the drive.

01:03:16.514 --> 01:03:17.516
Who?

01:03:25.057 --> 01:03:26.325
Zoe.

01:03:26.358 --> 01:03:27.526
Zoe Katz.

01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:30.397
Our writing partner.
Your roommate.

01:03:31.264 --> 01:03:34.066
Oh, Zoe Katz...

01:03:34.099 --> 01:03:35.101
Our writing partner.

01:03:35.133 --> 01:03:36.369
My roommate.

01:03:39.137 --> 01:03:41.040
I don't understand the joke.

01:03:41.508 --> 01:03:43.977
I don't either, dude.
You tell me.

01:03:44.010 --> 01:03:45.445
Seriously.

01:03:47.512 --> 01:03:49.581
I don't get it.
Like, where's Zoe?

01:03:49.615 --> 01:03:51.284
I don't know,

01:03:51.316 --> 01:03:53.218
maybe she's off riding around
on her unicorn.

01:03:53.251 --> 01:03:54.553
Good one.

01:04:17.276 --> 01:04:18.611
Fart Squad Four.

01:04:19.678 --> 01:04:21.213
Are you okay?

01:04:25.050 --> 01:04:26.351
I gotta go.

01:04:43.635 --> 01:04:44.637
She's gone.

01:04:46.037 --> 01:04:48.173
Zoe Katz, from my sketch group.
She's gone.

01:04:48.206 --> 01:04:49.975
What do you mean?

01:04:50.008 --> 01:04:51.410
I went to her apartment.

01:04:51.443 --> 01:04:53.412
Her own roommate
didn't even know who she was.

01:04:53.445 --> 01:04:55.314
It's like she never
even existed.

01:04:55.847 --> 01:04:58.117
Do you understand
what that means?

01:04:58.517 --> 01:05:02.354
We paradoxed her,
by making that phone call,

01:05:02.387 --> 01:05:05.025
we paradoxed Zoe
out of existence.

01:05:07.626 --> 01:05:09.329
Why are you out here?

01:05:09.695 --> 01:05:11.463
Don't be mad at me.

01:05:12.231 --> 01:05:13.166
For what?

01:05:20.305 --> 01:05:21.273
What happened?

01:05:23.142 --> 01:05:24.611
I'm real sorry.

01:05:26.012 --> 01:05:27.981
He said he needed
to use the bathroom...

01:05:28.014 --> 01:05:29.983
And I am not an idiot.

01:05:30.015 --> 01:05:32.050
I was just gonna, like,
give him a bucket,

01:05:32.084 --> 01:05:35.421
but he must have gotten,
like, a hand lose or something,

01:05:35.454 --> 01:05:38.758
because when I got close,
he just jumped up.

01:05:38.791 --> 01:05:43.296
He was just on me,
and that's what happened.

01:05:43.595 --> 01:05:45.231
I'm sorry.

01:05:51.704 --> 01:05:54.307
Which way did he go?

01:05:55.775 --> 01:05:57.410
I'm sorry, what?

01:05:59.278 --> 01:06:01.714
He saw him get up.
Which way did he go?

01:06:01.747 --> 01:06:04.451
Oh... Forward, I think.

01:06:07.285 --> 01:06:09.188
- What does that mean?
- What?

01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:11.523
What does that mean,
forward, you think?

01:06:11.557 --> 01:06:14.427
He got loose
and went for the time box.

01:06:14.459 --> 01:06:17.429
So, forward... in time.

01:06:19.798 --> 01:06:23.003
Wait. He...

01:06:24.302 --> 01:06:26.705
He got into the time box?

01:06:26.738 --> 01:06:28.206
Yeah, he's not here anymore.

01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:29.642
You saw him
get into the time box?

01:06:29.675 --> 01:06:32.211
Yeah, he went right for it.
So, he's back.

01:06:32.244 --> 01:06:34.514
Where he started from.
You know what I mean?

01:06:36.514 --> 01:06:38.517
That's a problem...

01:06:40.186 --> 01:06:41.553
Dad, that's a problem.

01:06:41.586 --> 01:06:43.523
- Do you get what I mean?
- Yes.

01:06:43.555 --> 01:06:44.724
- Do you?
- Yes.

01:06:44.756 --> 01:06:47.026
- Do you know what I mean?
- Yes.

01:06:47.727 --> 01:06:49.796
Because now he's telling them
what's going on.

01:06:49.829 --> 01:06:51.697
He's telling them what we did.

01:06:51.729 --> 01:06:53.432
And they're going
to put it together,

01:06:53.465 --> 01:06:55.333
and they're going to send
people here.

01:06:55.367 --> 01:06:58.438
You know, bad people.
Worse than him. Lots of them.

01:06:58.470 --> 01:07:00.840
So, we can't stay here.

01:07:00.872 --> 01:07:02.809
- We've got to go.
- Shut up!

01:07:02.842 --> 01:07:04.343
- What?
- Shut up!

01:07:04.376 --> 01:07:06.111
- I'm trying to...
- Just shut up! Alright?

01:07:06.144 --> 01:07:09.416
Just grab anything that matters.
Let's get out of here.

01:07:11.749 --> 01:07:12.651
Okay.

01:07:13.785 --> 01:07:15.387
- Dad!
- Hurry up!

01:07:15.421 --> 01:07:17.290
- Wait, Dad.
- Come on, move!

01:07:17.322 --> 01:07:19.825
- Dad, I'm going, wait.
- Come on!

01:07:19.858 --> 01:07:21.526
- What do we do?
- I don't know.

01:07:21.559 --> 01:07:22.628
- Where do we go?
- I don't know.

01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:24.496
- Why are you yelling at me?
- I'm not yelling at you.

01:07:24.530 --> 01:07:25.631
Hey.

01:07:31.871 --> 01:07:34.606
Do you have change for the bus?

01:07:39.778 --> 01:07:40.913
Change for the bus?

01:07:40.945 --> 01:07:42.714
I was just telling my dad,
he's got a bunch of change.

01:07:42.747 --> 01:07:45.617
Run! Run! Run!

01:07:46.352 --> 01:07:48.755
Go! Go! Go!

01:07:55.260 --> 01:07:56.829
- You think he followed us?
- I don't know.

01:07:56.861 --> 01:07:58.731
- Maybe when we doubled back?
- I don't know.

01:07:58.764 --> 01:08:00.399
Okay, I think we lost him.

01:08:00.432 --> 01:08:02.602
Lost who?

01:08:02.968 --> 01:08:05.271
Rose. How do you
keep getting in here?

01:08:05.704 --> 01:08:07.273
The key. Same key.

01:08:07.305 --> 01:08:09.407
Okay. You can't be here.

01:08:09.441 --> 01:08:10.610
We need to talk.

01:08:12.211 --> 01:08:14.180
- Now's not a good time.
- It's never a good time.

01:08:14.213 --> 01:08:15.814
- Okay, but not now.
- I'm leaving.

01:08:15.847 --> 01:08:18.283
Okay, great.
I'll text you tomorrow.

01:08:18.317 --> 01:08:21.688
No, I mean,
I'm leaving for good.

01:08:26.791 --> 01:08:28.127
What?

01:08:28.594 --> 01:08:31.296
My aunt Alice
has a place in Philadelphia,

01:08:31.330 --> 01:08:33.899
and she told me
to stay with her until...

01:08:35.334 --> 01:08:36.803
Until the baby is born.

01:08:39.270 --> 01:08:41.273
I'm sorry, what did you say?

01:08:42.473 --> 01:08:44.176
Copper, bathroom.

01:08:44.210 --> 01:08:46.779
- But she said baby.
- You know, paradox.

01:08:47.011 --> 01:08:49.182
Okay, wait in the bathroom now.

01:08:49.214 --> 01:08:49.915
Go.

01:08:51.482 --> 01:08:52.451
Okay.

01:09:20.312 --> 01:09:21.648
When would you go?

01:09:30.488 --> 01:09:32.759
You're not going to try
to stop me?

01:09:37.028 --> 01:09:39.531
I don't know
what I'm supposed to say.

01:09:43.469 --> 01:09:44.904
Say what you feel.

01:09:48.741 --> 01:09:49.876
It's complicated.

01:09:50.509 --> 01:09:51.644
No...

01:09:53.278 --> 01:09:54.379
It's not.

01:09:55.848 --> 01:09:57.717
It is incredibly simple.

01:09:59.852 --> 01:10:01.387
Do you love me?

01:10:02.420 --> 01:10:03.522
Rose...

01:10:03.822 --> 01:10:05.457
Do you love me?

01:10:06.625 --> 01:10:09.662
Yes, of course I love you.

01:10:09.695 --> 01:10:12.764
Then show me, Barnaby,
for once in your life.

01:10:12.798 --> 01:10:14.733
Make an effort. Ask me to stay.

01:10:26.045 --> 01:10:27.480
But you won't.

01:10:37.723 --> 01:10:39.325
I am so stupid.

01:10:41.393 --> 01:10:42.428
I should go.

01:10:52.470 --> 01:10:54.674
I keep waiting for this moment.

01:10:59.344 --> 01:11:00.780
I must be crazy.

01:11:01.312 --> 01:11:05.384
I keep telling myself
that someday you'll see.

01:11:11.357 --> 01:11:12.592
See what?

01:11:17.662 --> 01:11:19.031
Goodbye, Barnaby.

01:11:44.723 --> 01:11:45.925
Was that my mom?

01:11:47.492 --> 01:11:48.794
You have to go.

01:11:50.396 --> 01:11:51.363
What?

01:11:51.397 --> 01:11:52.665
This is too dangerous.

01:11:52.697 --> 01:11:53.999
Everything that we're doing
is crazy,

01:11:54.031 --> 01:11:56.034
and the more time
we spend together

01:11:56.067 --> 01:11:58.338
the more crazy stuff can happen.

01:11:58.937 --> 01:12:02.140
But we've got to save the future
so I can't go anywhere.

01:12:02.174 --> 01:12:05.578
How are we doing that?
Because I don't know anymore.

01:12:05.611 --> 01:12:08.613
I don't know,
but we can figure it out.

01:12:08.647 --> 01:12:10.750
Like, we can capture
another time assassin,

01:12:10.782 --> 01:12:14.019
or ask one of your friends who
have all the ideas, whatever.

01:12:14.853 --> 01:12:16.155
One doesn't exist anymore.

01:12:16.187 --> 01:12:18.090
Do you remember that?
She's gone.

01:12:18.491 --> 01:12:20.426
Why are you yelling at me?

01:12:21.826 --> 01:12:22.927
You have to go.

01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:25.430
Okay, I get what you're saying.

01:12:25.464 --> 01:12:28.868
It's just, we're a team,
so we've got to stay together.

01:12:28.901 --> 01:12:30.603
We're not a team.

01:12:30.635 --> 01:12:32.905
We're idiots that don't know
what they're doing.

01:12:32.937 --> 01:12:35.073
We're a dumpster fire.

01:12:35.107 --> 01:12:36.909
This was a mistake. I'm sorry.

01:12:37.342 --> 01:12:40.612
Okay, that's fine.
Just don't make me go, okay?

01:12:41.146 --> 01:12:44.517
Just don't make me go.
Don't tell me to go.

01:12:44.549 --> 01:12:45.851
You've got to go.

01:12:45.884 --> 01:12:47.119
Okay, just don't ask
me to go.

01:12:47.152 --> 01:12:48.988
Copper, I don't have a choice.

01:12:49.487 --> 01:12:52.557
You always have a choice,
so don't say that.

01:12:53.058 --> 01:12:54.127
Copper...

01:12:55.093 --> 01:12:56.729
- Copper.
- It's not my name.

01:12:57.329 --> 01:12:59.799
You have to go. You have to go!

01:13:03.134 --> 01:13:05.972
Why is it always so easy
for you to get rid of me?

01:13:11.643 --> 01:13:12.678
Okay.

01:13:13.245 --> 01:13:14.479
Okay.

01:13:16.214 --> 01:13:17.616
Okay.

01:13:53.751 --> 01:13:55.854
Okay.

01:15:29.447 --> 01:15:31.082
Hey, Dad.

01:15:33.384 --> 01:15:34.954
Are you mad at me?

01:15:34.987 --> 01:15:37.790
They're gonna figure out
what happened here.

01:15:37.822 --> 01:15:40.927
It's gonna take them some time,
but they'll figure it out.

01:15:42.094 --> 01:15:43.996
And then people will be coming.

01:15:44.396 --> 01:15:45.930
You know what I mean
when I say that?

01:15:45.964 --> 01:15:49.001
Like, bad people
are coming here.

01:15:49.034 --> 01:15:51.070
- So...
- Grab anything that matters.

01:16:47.092 --> 01:16:48.827
You're Barnaby's friend, right?

01:16:50.295 --> 01:16:51.797
I'm sorry, what?

01:16:52.263 --> 01:16:56.734
You were with Barnaby
last night in his apartment.

01:16:56.768 --> 01:16:59.105
Oh, yeah, that was me.
I was there.

01:16:59.970 --> 01:17:01.406
I didn't mean to scare you.

01:17:01.439 --> 01:17:03.976
Oh, it's okay.
I'm scared all the time.

01:17:04.009 --> 01:17:05.711
So, it's normal for me.

01:17:05.744 --> 01:17:06.911
How are you?

01:17:06.945 --> 01:17:09.447
I'm fine.
Are you bleeding?

01:17:09.481 --> 01:17:11.183
Probably, yeah.

01:17:12.483 --> 01:17:14.318
What happened?

01:17:14.352 --> 01:17:17.089
Oh, I got into a big fight.
In a big brawl with people.

01:17:17.723 --> 01:17:19.124
Are you okay?

01:17:19.156 --> 01:17:22.227
Yeah, I got away this time,
so it's all good.

01:17:23.894 --> 01:17:26.331
You look really bad.
Let me just...

01:17:26.665 --> 01:17:28.434
Come to the couch.
I'll clean you up.

01:17:29.735 --> 01:17:31.804
Let me take care of it. Come on.

01:17:32.804 --> 01:17:34.239
Come on, I'll clean you up.

01:17:34.272 --> 01:17:36.008
- You?
- Yeah.

01:17:36.540 --> 01:17:38.910
My house stuff.
You sit right there.

01:17:38.943 --> 01:17:40.079
Okay.

01:17:46.117 --> 01:17:47.419
Alright, now.

01:17:49.987 --> 01:17:55.226
Okay, so let's just take off
your coat,

01:17:55.259 --> 01:17:56.728
so that I can clean you.

01:17:56.762 --> 01:17:57.929
Okay.

01:17:59.196 --> 01:18:01.132
Can you take it off?

01:18:01.165 --> 01:18:03.367
Take off your jacket.

01:18:03.401 --> 01:18:06.037
It's also a little bit big
for you,

01:18:06.071 --> 01:18:07.906
so next time get a smaller one.

01:18:07.938 --> 01:18:10.008
- It'll fit you better.
- Okay.

01:18:13.178 --> 01:18:14.345
Alright.

01:18:15.379 --> 01:18:17.281
- This may sting.
- What?

01:18:17.314 --> 01:18:18.951
- It may sting.
- Okay.

01:18:18.983 --> 01:18:20.818
- Are you ready?
- Um hmm.

01:18:20.852 --> 01:18:21.821
Okay.

01:18:25.991 --> 01:18:27.159
A bit too much?

01:18:27.192 --> 01:18:28.094
It's good.

01:18:29.227 --> 01:18:30.229
Okay.

01:18:38.036 --> 01:18:39.238
Um...

01:18:41.005 --> 01:18:42.741
How far along are you?

01:18:45.043 --> 01:18:46.812
Is it okay to ask that?

01:18:49.246 --> 01:18:51.116
- It's six weeks.
- Um hmm.

01:18:53.184 --> 01:18:55.153
What do you think
you're gonna do?

01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:59.457
Well, I've been looking
at a lot of adoption agencies,

01:18:59.957 --> 01:19:03.094
and they have some
really great programs, so...

01:19:06.932 --> 01:19:09.101
So, you don't
want to keep it?

01:19:10.268 --> 01:19:12.171
I want to do what's best
for everybody.

01:19:13.004 --> 01:19:14.240
That makes sense.

01:19:14.505 --> 01:19:16.541
- I'm sorry to ask about it.
- It's okay.

01:19:19.510 --> 01:19:21.213
I was adopted.

01:19:22.981 --> 01:19:24.483
- You were?
- Um hmm.

01:19:24.515 --> 01:19:27.286
I know what it feels like,
if you are wondering.

01:19:28.219 --> 01:19:29.789
You can tell me.

01:19:30.589 --> 01:19:32.323
It makes you feel small.

01:19:33.558 --> 01:19:36.162
Like nothing you do matters,
you know?

01:19:36.394 --> 01:19:40.398
Like, these people made you,
then toss you in the garbage.

01:19:42.067 --> 01:19:43.869
Everyone else has parents
and a family,

01:19:43.902 --> 01:19:45.103
but not me.

01:19:45.135 --> 01:19:46.272
I don't have anything.

01:19:46.738 --> 01:19:48.406
They didn't leave a name,
you know?

01:19:48.439 --> 01:19:51.476
So, I mean, who am I, right?

01:19:51.509 --> 01:19:53.111
Just makes you feel like less.

01:19:53.143 --> 01:19:55.481
That nothing you do
really matters, you know?

01:19:58.316 --> 01:19:59.318
You're wrong.

01:20:01.486 --> 01:20:03.889
- What do you mean?
- It's so wrong.

01:20:05.956 --> 01:20:08.126
If I give up my child,

01:20:09.527 --> 01:20:13.398
it's because
I want something more for them.

01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:15.032
If I give up my child,

01:20:15.066 --> 01:20:16.602
that's giving them a chance
to have things

01:20:16.634 --> 01:20:18.536
that I can never give to them.

01:20:19.004 --> 01:20:22.140
Um hmm, so you love your son?

01:20:23.275 --> 01:20:25.443
Son? Did Barnaby say that?

01:20:27.245 --> 01:20:29.214
No, I was just guessing.

01:20:29.246 --> 01:20:32.050
It was like a girl or boy,
I thought boy was nailing it.

01:20:32.617 --> 01:20:35.286
Well, it's too early
to know the sex,

01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:37.289
but I have a feeling.

01:20:39.156 --> 01:20:40.458
But you love your child?

01:20:42.259 --> 01:20:43.928
Do I love my child?

01:20:46.196 --> 01:20:48.433
With everything that I am.

01:20:56.340 --> 01:20:58.544
And I'm sure
that your mom does, too.

01:21:21.499 --> 01:21:23.568
Okay, I should go.

01:21:24.036 --> 01:21:27.473
It'd been great, but thank you.

01:21:28.540 --> 01:21:32.211
Thank you for my face. Um...

01:21:32.643 --> 01:21:34.545
Okay, I've got to go.

01:21:38.450 --> 01:21:42.588
Hey, I'm sorry,
I know it's too early,

01:21:43.388 --> 01:21:47.026
but any thought to what
you might name the baby?

01:21:48.326 --> 01:21:50.562
Her name is Everly Rose Dorset.

01:21:53.497 --> 01:21:54.465
Okay.

01:21:57.168 --> 01:21:59.071
2002, I came
in the Hollywood Hills.

01:21:59.103 --> 01:22:00.738
I'd just signed Andrew Shen

01:22:00.772 --> 01:22:04.276
to a multi-picture deal
for the rich and hot franchise.

01:22:04.308 --> 01:22:06.544
I'm talking about
I made $3 million that day.

01:22:06.577 --> 01:22:09.414
And you know how I felt? Good.

01:22:09.446 --> 01:22:11.215
Just like you guys, okay?

01:22:11.249 --> 01:22:12.651
- How are you guys feeling?
- I feel good.

01:22:12.683 --> 01:22:14.452
- How are you feeling?
- Good.

01:22:14.486 --> 01:22:16.555
- Good.
- Great. Barnaby?

01:22:17.688 --> 01:22:19.258
Barnaby!

01:22:19.491 --> 01:22:21.126
What was the question?

01:22:22.693 --> 01:22:24.330
How are we feeling?

01:22:25.662 --> 01:22:27.531
Good.

01:22:27.564 --> 01:22:29.601
It'll just be another minute.
Can I get you guys anything?

01:22:29.634 --> 01:22:32.037
Water? Juice?

01:22:32.070 --> 01:22:34.238
- We're good. Thanks.
- Okay, great.

01:22:34.805 --> 01:22:36.407
Guys, this is it.

01:22:36.441 --> 01:22:38.076
You're going to slay it.

01:22:38.108 --> 01:22:40.277
Hey, Barnaby,
could you turn that shit off?

01:22:40.311 --> 01:22:42.179
Everybody, take out
your cell phones right now.

01:22:42.213 --> 01:22:43.215
Turn them off now.

01:22:45.750 --> 01:22:47.453
- Hello?
- I'm going to do something.

01:22:47.986 --> 01:22:50.155
- Copper!
- Yeah, like 20 minutes.

01:22:50.187 --> 01:22:52.523
What do you mean 20 minutes?
For what?

01:22:52.557 --> 01:22:54.626
I don't know,
but it'll be something.

01:22:54.659 --> 01:22:55.561
Barnaby!

01:22:57.629 --> 01:22:58.729
Where are you?

01:22:58.763 --> 01:23:00.499
- I saw mom.
- What?

01:23:00.531 --> 01:23:03.168
She was taking out photos
of the underground.

01:23:03.201 --> 01:23:04.770
She is wonderful.

01:23:04.803 --> 01:23:06.671
Listen, whatever it is
you think you're going to do,

01:23:06.704 --> 01:23:08.540
do not do it.
It is too dangerous.

01:23:08.572 --> 01:23:11.075
- Hey, Barnaby?
- Just one second.

01:23:11.509 --> 01:23:13.812
I know what happens
if I don't do anything.

01:23:13.844 --> 01:23:15.414
And I know it's bad.

01:23:15.446 --> 01:23:17.615
- But you can make it worse.
- Or better.

01:23:18.049 --> 01:23:20.218
Okay, listen, as your father,

01:23:20.250 --> 01:23:22.120
I'm telling you
not to do anything, okay?

01:23:23.588 --> 01:23:25.624
I thinking about
your father, actually.

01:23:27.092 --> 01:23:28.727
About how you said
he was miserable,

01:23:28.759 --> 01:23:30.061
because he never made it.

01:23:31.429 --> 01:23:35.034
And I thought about mom
and how great she is.

01:23:35.666 --> 01:23:37.201
And how wonderful it would be

01:23:37.235 --> 01:23:39.103
to have someone in your life
like that.

01:23:40.705 --> 01:23:41.774
And I was thinking,

01:23:42.974 --> 01:23:45.710
maybe your dad wasn't miserable
because he never made it.

01:23:47.545 --> 01:23:48.747
Maybe he was miserable

01:23:48.780 --> 01:23:50.115
because he never realized
he had.

01:23:53.418 --> 01:23:54.553
What are you going to do?

01:23:55.786 --> 01:23:58.723
The only thing I can do.
Make a choice and play.

01:23:59.223 --> 01:24:02.293
Copper,
what are you going to do?

01:24:06.164 --> 01:24:08.200
I'm going to paradox everything.

01:24:13.871 --> 01:24:16.474
- They're ready for you guys.
- Thank you so much.

01:24:16.508 --> 01:24:19.178
- Follow me back.
- Right this way. Okay.

01:24:22.479 --> 01:24:24.648
Hey, Barnaby, let's go.

01:24:24.682 --> 01:24:26.318
The future's waiting.

01:24:30.321 --> 01:24:31.456
What am I doing here?

01:24:52.744 --> 01:24:54.713
Come on, come on!

01:24:55.513 --> 01:24:56.482
No!

01:24:57.514 --> 01:24:59.250
Rose, it's Barnaby, listen...

01:24:59.284 --> 01:25:01.686
You got to call me back.
It's an emergency.

01:25:01.719 --> 01:25:02.621
Dammit!

01:25:08.259 --> 01:25:09.495
Hey, guy!

01:25:10.827 --> 01:25:12.930
What the hell's
going on here, man?

01:25:12.964 --> 01:25:15.467
Oh, you are a red card.
I get it.

01:25:15.500 --> 01:25:17.336
You'll see.
It'll only take a minute.

01:25:18.570 --> 01:25:21.438
Rose, listen, if you're still
at the underground, stay there.

01:25:21.472 --> 01:25:22.808
I'm coming to you.

01:25:23.241 --> 01:25:24.809
This is not gonna make
any sense at all,

01:25:24.842 --> 01:25:26.678
but we have to be touching,
or otherwise

01:25:26.710 --> 01:25:28.679
you could be wiped out
of existence.

01:25:29.246 --> 01:25:31.549
Whatever... I'm coming to you.

01:25:31.883 --> 01:25:33.218
Who the hell are you?

01:25:33.250 --> 01:25:34.452
What the hell is this?

01:25:35.353 --> 01:25:36.588
Who the hell are you?

01:25:36.620 --> 01:25:38.322
<i>What the hell is this?</i>

01:25:38.990 --> 01:25:41.360
<i>Hey, you turn around
and look at me!</i>

01:25:42.326 --> 01:25:43.494
<i>I want answers.</i>

01:25:44.062 --> 01:25:45.863
<i>What the hell's going on?</i>

01:25:45.897 --> 01:25:47.265
Who are you?

01:25:48.299 --> 01:25:50.302
I'm Everly Rose Dorset.

01:26:14.726 --> 01:26:15.893
<i>I heard them tell
the assassins once</i>

01:26:15.927 --> 01:26:17.762
<i>if you walk through a door,</i>

01:26:17.795 --> 01:26:19.331
<i>and you end up in a place
you weren't expecting,</i>

01:26:19.363 --> 01:26:21.232
<i>that means
a paradox is happening.</i>

01:26:21.265 --> 01:26:22.901
<i>Like, it's still happening.
You know what I mean?</i>

01:26:22.933 --> 01:26:24.769
<i>What do you do if that happens?</i>

01:26:25.070 --> 01:26:27.238
<i>Find another door.
Go through it.</i>

01:26:27.272 --> 01:26:28.740
<i>Keep doing that
until you end up back</i>

01:26:28.772 --> 01:26:30.808
<i>in the place you started.
If you do that,</i>

01:26:30.842 --> 01:26:33.010
<i>then you know you're safe
and the paradox is over.</i>

01:26:33.044 --> 01:26:37.215
Hey, man.
What are you doing in my house?

01:26:40.550 --> 01:26:41.452
What?

01:26:42.687 --> 01:26:44.456
What are you doing in my house?

01:26:48.293 --> 01:26:49.428
<i>Do you love me?</i>

01:26:50.728 --> 01:26:51.663
<i>Rose.</i>

01:26:52.229 --> 01:26:53.799
<i>Do you love me?</i>

01:26:54.965 --> 01:26:56.700
<i>I mean, I get on stage a bunch,</i>

01:26:56.733 --> 01:26:59.271
<i>but I never really step off
the back line.</i>

01:26:59.771 --> 01:27:02.741
<i>Yes, of course I love you.</i>

01:27:03.875 --> 01:27:04.843
<i>Then show me.</i>

01:27:05.942 --> 01:27:06.844
Gas leak?

01:27:07.711 --> 01:27:08.946
What?

01:27:08.979 --> 01:27:10.714
There's a gas leak
in this house.

01:27:10.747 --> 01:27:12.284
We got to get out of here.

01:27:12.317 --> 01:27:13.785
What are you talking about?

01:27:13.817 --> 01:27:15.419
I'm with the gas authority.

01:27:15.452 --> 01:27:17.488
You gotta get out of here.
It's dangerous.

01:27:17.522 --> 01:27:19.057
This house does
not even run on gas.

01:27:19.089 --> 01:27:20.624
This house used to run on gas.

01:27:20.657 --> 01:27:21.992
There's a line underneath
that's leaking.

01:27:22.026 --> 01:27:23.662
- Do you want to live?
- Yes.

01:27:23.695 --> 01:27:25.697
Okay, open those windows.
I gotta open the door.

01:27:25.729 --> 01:27:28.532
- Okay.
- Open those windows. Go!

01:27:42.780 --> 01:27:44.282
Hey!

01:27:44.616 --> 01:27:46.952
- Hey.
- You're new to the building?

01:27:47.184 --> 01:27:49.687
Yeah, I just moved in.

01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:50.789
Oh, cool. What unit?

01:27:50.821 --> 01:27:51.856
Four.

01:27:52.889 --> 01:27:53.892
I'm in four.

01:27:53.924 --> 01:27:56.494
Great. I'll see you, then.

01:28:05.670 --> 01:28:07.005
- Delivery for Micah.
- Who?

01:28:07.037 --> 01:28:08.473
Wrong house.

01:28:12.610 --> 01:28:13.612
Same place.

01:28:14.278 --> 01:28:16.013
- Second delivery for Micah.
- Who?

01:28:21.619 --> 01:28:23.688
What?

01:28:25.723 --> 01:28:26.858
Okay.

01:28:30.762 --> 01:28:31.897
<i>I'm pregnant.</i>

01:28:33.764 --> 01:28:34.999
<i>You won't try to stop me?</i>

01:28:52.183 --> 01:28:53.085
Rose.

01:28:56.987 --> 01:28:57.988
Rose!

01:29:00.691 --> 01:29:01.893
Rose!

01:29:06.496 --> 01:29:07.732
Rose!

01:29:28.186 --> 01:29:29.121
Barnaby...

01:29:32.889 --> 01:29:34.625
What are you doing here?

01:29:36.460 --> 01:29:37.829
Showing you.

01:29:40.464 --> 01:29:41.465
Stay.

01:29:42.799 --> 01:29:44.135
I want you to stay.

01:29:45.070 --> 01:29:47.604
I don't know
what's gonna happen tomorrow.

01:29:47.638 --> 01:29:50.142
I don't care,
as long as it's with you.

01:29:53.478 --> 01:29:54.813
It's about time.

01:30:06.256 --> 01:30:07.892
But we need to find cover.

01:30:07.924 --> 01:30:09.526
It'll be dark soon,
and the lobster people,

01:30:09.559 --> 01:30:10.896
they'll be looking for us.

01:30:12.996 --> 01:30:14.064
What?

01:30:14.098 --> 01:30:15.467
We have to go.

01:30:15.500 --> 01:30:16.835
What? Wait, what?

01:30:29.851 --> 01:30:34.851
