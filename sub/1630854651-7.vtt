00:13.625 --> 00:15.791
Are you ready for your big trip, Zuzs?

00:15.875 --> 00:17.166
Very excited!

00:17.250 --> 00:20.833
First time back in Krakow
not under Soviet control.

00:20.916 --> 00:23.666
Oh, my friend Jake Kashminski
was just in Poland.

00:23.750 --> 00:24.958
You know him, right?

00:25.041 --> 00:27.375
Diane, not all Polish people
know each other.

00:27.458 --> 00:29.833
No, we do. I know Jake, he is nice guy.

00:29.916 --> 00:31.833
Okay, here is my client list.

00:31.916 --> 00:33.333
Do good job for them.

00:33.416 --> 00:35.833
How come you get all her clients?

00:39.125 --> 00:41.791
Were you genuinely asking that question?

00:41.875 --> 00:43.125
Oh, sweetie.

00:43.208 --> 00:45.458
No, it's just because I'm more reliable.

00:45.541 --> 00:46.416
No offense.

00:46.500 --> 00:47.375
Offense!

00:47.458 --> 00:50.375
I'm reliable <i>and</i> I'm great at my job.

00:50.458 --> 00:51.333
Oh! Oh!

00:51.416 --> 00:54.708
-Ah! Ah! Oh!

00:58.083 --> 00:59.708
Okay, point taken.

00:59.791 --> 01:01.875
-Ooh, that's my Uber!

01:01.958 --> 01:03.166
That's an Uber?

01:03.250 --> 01:05.416
Yes, he's my friend, Uber Kowalski.

01:05.500 --> 01:07.041
I am coming!

01:07.125 --> 01:10.458
Bye, Zuzs! Have a great time!

01:12.166 --> 01:13.708
I could use a vacation.

01:13.791 --> 01:15.458
Your life is a vacation.

01:15.541 --> 01:17.208
Now, clean up that damn talc.

01:17.291 --> 01:19.250
And not with your nose.

01:19.333 --> 01:20.958
I did that one time!

01:29.291 --> 01:32.166
Come here, you wiry little son of a bitch.

01:32.250 --> 01:33.791
Ah! Gotcha!

01:33.875 --> 01:35.833
Diane, come in here, please.

01:35.916 --> 01:38.125
Oh, he said "please."

01:38.208 --> 01:39.458
You're in trouble!

01:40.625 --> 01:43.791
Okay, busted.
My Barbicide is Blue Curaçao.

01:43.875 --> 01:45.833
I'm the one that keeps microwaving fish.

01:45.916 --> 01:48.458
-I don't understand the cash register--
-Stop! Enough!

01:48.541 --> 01:50.833
Listen, I have a proposal for you--

01:50.916 --> 01:53.083
I accept. One night, one million dollars.

01:53.166 --> 01:54.875
You can do whatever you want.

01:54.958 --> 01:56.250
No questions asked.

01:56.333 --> 01:58.500
You can remove the tape
when I'm done speaking.

01:58.583 --> 02:00.375
Remember that lotion
you gave me for Christmas?

02:00.458 --> 02:03.291
-Mm-hmm.
-Well, I've been using it every day

02:03.375 --> 02:05.541
and I gotta hand it to you,
it's incredible.

02:05.625 --> 02:06.916
I think it could be a hit.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.666
And I believe that--

02:09.666 --> 02:10.958
You and I…

02:11.041 --> 02:13.208
Sweet Jesus, is this happening?

02:13.291 --> 02:14.875
…should go into business together.

02:14.958 --> 02:16.875
Are you fucking kidding me?

02:16.958 --> 02:18.500
Remove the tape.

02:18.583 --> 02:19.416
Ah!

02:19.500 --> 02:20.916
Ooh, I got another hair!

02:21.000 --> 02:23.375
Gideon, I am in, baby!

02:23.458 --> 02:25.583
Let's start a test batch.

02:25.666 --> 02:27.791
We can sell it here. Maybe 20 jars?

02:27.875 --> 02:28.750
Twenty jars…

02:28.833 --> 02:31.750
Let's see, Cubs are playing at home
till Friday,

02:31.833 --> 02:35.083
Styx cover band at Sluggers next week,
carry the one…

02:35.166 --> 02:38.000
I could get that to you by Q3,
at the earliest.

02:38.083 --> 02:40.458
Okay, I knew this wouldn't work.
Too unreliable.

02:40.541 --> 02:43.083
No. I'm reliable! I can do this!

02:43.166 --> 02:45.250
And I can get them done by tomorrow!

02:45.333 --> 02:47.458
Please don't make me regret this.

02:47.541 --> 02:48.750
Oh, I will!

02:48.833 --> 02:51.333
I mean, I will do a good job.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Hey, that's my old art teacher.

02:58.083 --> 02:59.083
Yes, it is.

02:59.166 --> 03:01.958
Kreativ Jus believes
that supporting local artists

03:02.041 --> 03:04.583
is important for the betterment
of our communities.

03:05.166 --> 03:06.666
And it's a huge tax write-off.

03:07.458 --> 03:09.500
Hey, Samuel.
I don't know if you remember me…

03:09.583 --> 03:11.833
Sure! Daniel, right?

03:11.916 --> 03:14.083
How's the journey of the young artist?

03:14.166 --> 03:16.250
Good! I mean, not so much with the art,

03:16.333 --> 03:18.916
but at home, we do listen
to a lot of Journey.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.333
How much is this one?

03:20.416 --> 03:22.250
Ah! You have a great eye.

03:22.333 --> 03:23.666
That's an oil-on-canvas,

03:23.750 --> 03:26.250
crafted as a response
to the climate crisis.

03:26.333 --> 03:28.208
I'm asking $250.

03:28.291 --> 03:30.708
-I'll give you ten bucks for it.
-Ugh!

03:30.791 --> 03:34.333
Well, you seem passionate
for the piece so, I accept.

03:35.666 --> 03:38.791
Oh, for credit cards,
there is a one-dollar processing fee.

03:38.875 --> 03:39.875
Eh, forget it.

03:41.083 --> 03:43.958
Hey, screw that guy.
He wouldn't appreciate it, anyways.

03:44.041 --> 03:45.583
Oh, it's fine, Daniel.

03:45.666 --> 03:48.625
Every piece will find
its way home, eventually.

03:48.708 --> 03:52.250
Plus, I have plenty of other chances
to sell one today.

03:59.958 --> 04:00.791
Ha!

04:00.875 --> 04:02.375
I got the stain out.

04:03.791 --> 04:05.583
Have a good day at work, honey.

04:05.666 --> 04:06.625
You too.

04:08.583 --> 04:10.708
Jill Grierson. Hmpf!

04:10.791 --> 04:14.333
Mark, I was washing your underwear
and I had a revelation.

04:14.416 --> 04:16.625
I know, I'm dehydrated.

04:16.708 --> 04:18.666
No, I want a job.

04:18.750 --> 04:21.750
With Daniel gone and no new baby,
I want to do something!

04:21.833 --> 04:22.916
Isn't this exciting?

04:23.000 --> 04:25.666
Yes! I mean, where's this all coming from?

04:25.750 --> 04:29.291
Jill Grierson, across the street,
had three kids, went back to work,

04:29.375 --> 04:33.250
and now, she's a big-time VP at Sky Zone.

04:33.333 --> 04:36.208
-Why can't I do that?
-You want to work at a trampoline park?

04:36.291 --> 04:40.041
No, I'll do what I used to do,
event planning, remember?

04:40.125 --> 04:42.750
I planned Jeremy Piven's 40th birthday.

04:43.416 --> 04:44.958
Yeah, but that was 20 years ago.

04:45.041 --> 04:47.250
Bonnie, don't feel like you need to work.

04:47.333 --> 04:49.958
I make plenty of money.
I got us covered, babe.

04:50.041 --> 04:51.750
That's not what this is about.

04:51.833 --> 04:53.250
I need purpose, Mark.

04:53.333 --> 04:56.625
I need to do something
other than scrub your yellow undies.

04:56.708 --> 04:58.708
Okay. Well, two things.

04:58.791 --> 05:02.083
One, I will drink more water, and two…

05:02.166 --> 05:03.916
I think you should go for this.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.458
Aww.

05:05.541 --> 05:07.125
This is so exciting!

05:07.208 --> 05:09.875
Get over here and kiss me
with those dry lips.

05:14.916 --> 05:16.208
Come here.

05:16.291 --> 05:17.625
Oh, hello again.

05:17.708 --> 05:22.166
Hey… Uh, I'm gonna just grab
these cans if that's okay.

05:22.250 --> 05:23.125
Oh, cool!

05:23.208 --> 05:25.875
Are you doing some kind
of mixed media piece?

05:25.958 --> 05:27.875
Yeah… exactly.

05:27.958 --> 05:30.916
That's such a great way
to find inspiration!

05:31.000 --> 05:34.625
You know, I'd actually like
to buy you lunch and pick your brain.

05:34.708 --> 05:38.333
How about you don't use the phrase
"pick your brain"? It's disgusting!

05:39.375 --> 05:40.583
I'm sorry.

05:40.666 --> 05:41.916
Look, the truth is,

05:42.000 --> 05:45.375
I make more money recycling these cans
than I do selling my art.

05:45.958 --> 05:49.166
Art is bullshit, okay?
The whole thing is a racket.

05:49.250 --> 05:52.666
What? But you've spent your life doing it.

05:52.750 --> 05:55.208
Yeah, and look at me!
I'm elbow-deep in trash.

05:55.291 --> 05:56.416
You want some advice?

05:56.500 --> 05:58.333
There are two kinds
of artists in this world,

05:58.416 --> 06:00.958
ones who make money
and ones who cut their fingers

06:01.041 --> 06:03.291
on cans of Feisty Cherry Diet Coke.

06:03.375 --> 06:04.875
Figure out which one you are.

06:04.958 --> 06:05.958
How do I do that?

06:06.041 --> 06:07.958
I don't know-- Create something.

06:08.041 --> 06:09.416
See if people respond to it.

06:09.500 --> 06:11.833
If they don't,
go into another field, quickly.

06:12.833 --> 06:14.583
Gimme that! That's mine!

06:20.000 --> 06:21.083
Hmm.

06:21.166 --> 06:22.666
Daniel! Little help?

06:25.041 --> 06:28.000
Ugh. I've asked you to wear pants
when you make queso!

06:28.083 --> 06:30.083
It's a health and safety issue.

06:30.166 --> 06:33.708
No queso! I told Gideon I could
make 20 bottles of my lotion.

06:33.791 --> 06:36.541
And I can't blow it
because no one thinks I'm reliable.

06:36.625 --> 06:40.083
Now, hold this Reese's Pieces bag
so I can pour this hot lotion in.

06:40.166 --> 06:43.541
Wait, I have a ton of little mason jars
from work. Just use those.

06:43.625 --> 06:46.250
Great idea! That's teamwork.

06:46.333 --> 06:48.625
Is it supposed to be this… watery?

06:48.708 --> 06:50.916
Balls! Proportions must be off.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.666
Needs more beef fat, my secret ingredient.

06:53.750 --> 06:55.750
Balls again, I'm all out!

06:55.833 --> 06:57.666
-What are we gonna do?
-I don't know!

06:57.750 --> 07:00.916
You can't just buy beef fat
in the middle of the night.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.625
-Not even in Chicago.

07:02.708 --> 07:04.583
-Eureka!
-What?

07:04.666 --> 07:06.791
The Eureka Diner down the street!

07:06.875 --> 07:07.833
Oh, right!

07:07.916 --> 07:09.625
The home of the meatloaf smoothie.

07:11.291 --> 07:13.083
Come to Mama.

07:14.375 --> 07:15.333
Hmm.

07:20.291 --> 07:21.333
Enjoy.

07:21.416 --> 07:22.625
Tell your friends.

07:25.041 --> 07:26.791
-Diane!
-I'm up! I'm up!

07:26.875 --> 07:28.125
No, you weren't.

07:28.208 --> 07:31.208
But you have earned your chair nap today.

07:31.291 --> 07:33.750
I have to say, I'm impressed!

07:33.833 --> 07:35.375
You actually delivered.

07:35.958 --> 07:39.083
Yeah, I was worried
when I ran out of our secret ingredient.

07:39.166 --> 07:43.083
But luckily, I was able to get my hands
on some beef fat from the diner.

07:43.166 --> 07:46.625
Diane, please don't tell anyone
we use beef fat.

07:46.708 --> 07:49.125
In the lotion business,
we call it "tallow."

07:49.208 --> 07:51.041
Now, this sold out in a day.

07:51.125 --> 07:53.041
Can you make 50 more?

07:53.125 --> 07:54.166
Fifty? Pfft!

07:54.250 --> 07:56.500
Now that I got an unlimited source
of beef fat--

07:56.583 --> 07:58.458
-Tallow.
-I can do a hundred!

07:58.541 --> 08:00.041
Let's do this, partner.

08:00.625 --> 08:02.625
Don't touch me with those beef hands!

08:05.500 --> 08:08.916
When she sang that acoustic version
of "Proud Mary," all the chairs turned.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.333
She picked Blake Shelton,
which I get for her sound,

08:11.416 --> 08:13.083
but if I was her, I--

08:13.166 --> 08:15.583
-We're being raided by the SEC! Run!

08:16.375 --> 08:18.166
-What?
-Hold the elevator!

08:18.250 --> 08:21.541
-Uh…

08:21.625 --> 08:23.000
Please vacate the premises!

08:23.083 --> 08:24.791
But what about my job?

08:24.875 --> 08:28.166
It's over! This company is bankrupt!
It no longer exists!

08:28.250 --> 08:29.083
Uh…

08:35.708 --> 08:36.625
Hey, fellas.

08:36.708 --> 08:39.166
Can we talk to you for minute
in car, please?

08:39.250 --> 08:40.666
Sorry, guys, I have a strict

08:40.750 --> 08:43.291
"don't get into a car
with guys wearing tracksuits" rule.

08:43.375 --> 08:45.750
Fool me nine times, shame on me.

08:45.833 --> 08:48.916
Right. Let us help you.

08:54.583 --> 08:56.000
Yes! A two liter!

08:57.125 --> 08:59.000
Okay, if you guys are cops,
you gotta tell me.

08:59.083 --> 09:00.166
We are not police.

09:00.250 --> 09:03.541
I am Stanislas. I own diner.

09:04.375 --> 09:06.416
What were you doing with our garbage?

09:06.500 --> 09:10.333
Well, me and my boss Gideon
are doing this little lotion company,

09:10.416 --> 09:12.750
and the secret ingredient is beef fat.

09:12.833 --> 09:15.125
So, you started business, huh?

09:15.208 --> 09:16.916
I have good news for you.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.333
Our beef fat is all yours.

09:19.416 --> 09:21.125
You can have, eh?

09:21.208 --> 09:22.833
For real? Thanks, Stan!

09:22.916 --> 09:24.541
Can I call you "Stan"?

09:24.625 --> 09:28.583
No. Only thing,
you need to give us little taste.

09:28.666 --> 09:30.708
Of the lotion? Sure.

09:30.791 --> 09:33.416
It's actually a decent substitute
when I'm out of mayo.

09:33.500 --> 09:37.541
No, no. You give us
little taste of lotion business.

09:37.625 --> 09:40.125
Oh! I'm not sure about that.

09:40.208 --> 09:43.083
We have to run that past Gideon and he's--

09:43.166 --> 09:45.083
Yes, yes. So, it's done.

09:45.166 --> 09:46.291
Partners.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.583
-Mm!
-Eh…

09:49.666 --> 09:51.583
You're gonna want to wash that.

09:53.291 --> 09:55.708
Get these motherfucking char dogs
off my counter,

09:55.791 --> 09:59.541
or I'm gonna slap your geeky
fuckin' face with 'em!

09:59.625 --> 10:01.416
Good one!

10:01.500 --> 10:02.583
Hey!

10:02.666 --> 10:04.666
Daniel, what are you doing here?

10:04.750 --> 10:08.333
I saw on Instagram that you were
having an installation at Wiener's Circle.

10:08.416 --> 10:10.708
Well, thank you for the follow,
that makes two.

10:10.791 --> 10:12.125
What do you got here?

10:12.208 --> 10:15.333
So, you kinda threw me
into an existential crisis

10:15.416 --> 10:16.708
and I painted something.

10:16.791 --> 10:18.291
And I'd like to show it to you

10:18.375 --> 10:21.166
and I need you
to be totally honest with me. Okay?

10:24.000 --> 10:27.541
You should abandon all hope
of ever making a dime being an artist.

10:27.625 --> 10:28.625
Find something else.

10:28.708 --> 10:30.791
Play the horses. Learn to code!

10:30.875 --> 10:34.541
Okay, I get it. Jesus Christ, too honest!

10:36.708 --> 10:38.333
-Uh-uh!

10:38.416 --> 10:40.458
That's on you! Clean that shit up!

10:42.625 --> 10:44.958
You see? This is what you'll be avoiding.

10:45.458 --> 10:47.916
Don't got all fuckin' day!
What do you want?

10:49.208 --> 10:53.958
After I left Let's Get This Party Starty
Events in 2001,

10:54.041 --> 10:58.666
I pivoted to a new client who I've been
working exclusively with for 18 years.

10:58.750 --> 11:02.625
I planned everything from dances
to musical premieres

11:02.708 --> 11:03.958
to homecoming rallies,

11:04.041 --> 11:08.041
and let me tell you,
this client could be very demanding.

11:08.125 --> 11:10.625
He's my son.

11:10.708 --> 11:14.041
We're looking for someone
with a larger social media presence.

11:14.125 --> 11:16.458
We're hoping to hire someone
a bit more fresh-faced.

11:16.541 --> 11:18.333
We're headed in a different direction,

11:18.416 --> 11:21.041
towards someone
with more valuable experience.

11:25.958 --> 11:27.541
And enjoy the lotion.

11:28.250 --> 11:30.083
Gid, we're gonna sell out again!

11:30.166 --> 11:31.666
That is wonderful!

11:31.750 --> 11:35.291
Now, I'll tell you what's not wonderful
is this logo you've chosen.

11:36.083 --> 11:38.083
Yeah… I just took a stab at it.

11:38.166 --> 11:41.250
Well, I want someone to stab me
when I see it.

11:41.333 --> 11:42.666
It needs to change.

11:42.750 --> 11:45.000
Ah! Another great idea from Gideon.

11:45.083 --> 11:47.708
And I thought we could call the lotion…

11:47.791 --> 11:49.291
Congeal.

11:49.375 --> 11:53.125
-I love it! Congeal it is. Genius.
-Hmm.

11:53.208 --> 11:54.958
Why are you being so agreeable?

11:55.041 --> 11:56.833
You don't appear to be that liquored up.

11:56.916 --> 11:59.625
-I told you, I'm a respons--

11:59.708 --> 12:01.416
Partners!

12:01.500 --> 12:03.041
I'm sorry, can I help you?

12:03.125 --> 12:05.000
Stanislas.

12:05.083 --> 12:09.708
Diane take my beef fat for lotion,
so we are partners now, yes?

12:10.791 --> 12:13.416
I'm pretty sure I told you, Gideon.

12:13.500 --> 12:16.583
Wow, you really don't listen
when women speak, huh?

12:16.666 --> 12:20.833
You most certainly did not tell me,
you gaslighting maniac.

12:20.916 --> 12:23.875
Partners, partners, don't fight.

12:23.958 --> 12:26.458
So, how many jars we sell today?

12:26.541 --> 12:27.500
-Zero.
-Fifty.

12:27.583 --> 12:29.916
-Ugh!
-Excellent. So…

12:31.333 --> 12:34.083
Next time, maybe we sell double.

12:34.166 --> 12:36.750
One hundred. We can do this!

12:37.375 --> 12:40.833
A hundred jars? I can't do that overnight.

12:40.916 --> 12:42.875
Girl, you're gonna have to!

13:12.500 --> 13:16.333
Daniel, that was an intense cook,
but we did it!

13:16.416 --> 13:17.833
Wait, what about the label?

13:17.916 --> 13:19.708
Shit, I forgot!

13:19.791 --> 13:21.166
Wait, what's that?

13:21.250 --> 13:23.041
Nothing, just a bad painting I made.

13:23.125 --> 13:24.333
I was gonna throw it out.

13:24.416 --> 13:26.666
Well, I think it's great. Can we use it?

13:26.750 --> 13:28.333
Really? You like it?

13:28.416 --> 13:29.875
It's perfect!

13:29.958 --> 13:32.041
Do you think you can
hand-draw 100 tiny labels

13:32.125 --> 13:33.375
in the next three hours?

13:33.458 --> 13:35.833
Um, no, but I could use a computer.

13:35.916 --> 13:38.541
Whatever you gotta do, Steve Jobs.

13:41.583 --> 13:46.666
I planned everything from dances to
musical premieres to homecoming rallies.

13:47.166 --> 13:52.000
So, I spent a lot of time organizing and--

13:52.083 --> 13:55.166
Excuse me, boys, but I am talking to you!

13:55.250 --> 13:57.166
Eyes up, phones down!

13:57.250 --> 13:59.000
-Mm!
-Now, you listen to me.

13:59.083 --> 14:01.500
You'd be lucky to have me work here.

14:01.583 --> 14:05.000
Nobody is more demanding
than a bunch of rich, white women,

14:05.083 --> 14:07.750
and I have planned parties
for hordes of them.

14:07.833 --> 14:10.666
So, if you don't give me this job,
it's your loss.

14:10.750 --> 14:13.041
Wait, Mommy! I mean, Bonnie!

14:13.125 --> 14:14.625
Yo, real talk?

14:14.708 --> 14:18.458
That kind of boss-lady energy
is what we need at our events.

14:18.541 --> 14:21.875
Yeah, I could really see you
telling someone the open bar is closed

14:21.958 --> 14:23.416
and it is now cash only.

14:23.500 --> 14:25.625
You! Are! Hired!

14:26.791 --> 14:28.666
Oh, yeah! Whoo-hoo!

14:34.000 --> 14:39.250
I absolutely, unequivocally,
beyond a shadow of a doubt…

14:39.916 --> 14:41.125
love it!

14:41.208 --> 14:43.583
Hell yeah! Are you serious?

14:43.666 --> 14:45.375
Daniel, it's wonderful!

14:45.458 --> 14:48.875
It's defined, yet generic. Genius!

14:48.958 --> 14:51.583
Okay. Wow! Thank you so much,

14:51.666 --> 14:54.416
because I was in a very dark place
and I felt--

14:54.500 --> 14:56.791
Listen, I'm gonna go ahead
and take the focus back.

14:56.875 --> 14:59.583
-Copy that.
-I spoke with Borough about our product.

14:59.666 --> 15:03.375
And they wanna order a test run
of 500 units!

15:03.458 --> 15:06.041
Holy shit, G-string! This is amazing!

15:06.125 --> 15:08.958
I know, very exciting!

15:09.041 --> 15:12.416
Now, can we move on to some news
that's not amazing?

15:13.041 --> 15:17.416
You have gotten us into a partnership
with Eastern European criminals!

15:21.458 --> 15:23.500
I told one of them
he couldn't smoke inside

15:23.583 --> 15:25.041
and he kissed me on the lips!

15:25.125 --> 15:28.458
Look, I agree they're not great
for our lotion business.

15:28.541 --> 15:30.541
There is no lotion business.

15:30.625 --> 15:32.166
We're being run by the mob!

15:32.250 --> 15:35.041
Relax, they're not hurting anyone.

15:35.125 --> 15:37.916
Hey, uh… those guys
are straight up robbing customers.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.250
Like, putting their hands
in pockets and shit.

15:40.333 --> 15:42.208
Diane, you need to fix this.

15:42.291 --> 15:44.958
Get them out of here, now!

15:45.041 --> 15:48.416
Don't worry, partner,
I know exactly what to say.

15:50.875 --> 15:53.000
Stanislaus, we need to talk.

15:53.083 --> 15:54.000
Yes, we do.

15:54.083 --> 15:57.708
You need to get television channel
called Ultima Polska.

15:57.791 --> 15:59.083
I have spoken to Gideon

15:59.166 --> 16:01.791
and we have decided that
we'd like to part ways with you.

16:01.875 --> 16:05.125
Part ways?
But where will you get your beef fat?

16:05.208 --> 16:07.166
It is not so easy to procure.

16:07.250 --> 16:09.208
Oh, we'll figure that out.

16:09.291 --> 16:12.458
But I'd like to thank you for your help
and ask that you hit the road.

16:14.791 --> 16:16.416
That does not work for me.

16:16.500 --> 16:19.041
All partners have to agree on things.

16:19.125 --> 16:20.666
I do not agree.

16:21.333 --> 16:24.625
Well, that's why
you're not a partner anymore, so--

16:24.708 --> 16:26.041
We make handshake deal.

16:26.125 --> 16:28.583
Nikolai was witness, he is Notary Public.

16:28.666 --> 16:30.458
I see it all. Legally binding.

16:30.541 --> 16:32.875
I say I am still partner.

16:33.375 --> 16:34.375
Or else.

16:35.166 --> 16:36.250
That's a comb.

16:36.333 --> 16:38.041
Hurts more with comb.

16:38.125 --> 16:39.625
Deal stands.

16:40.708 --> 16:44.625
Well, good talk.
I'm glad we hashed this out.

16:45.875 --> 16:49.000
So, I'm beginning to think
these guys are a real problem.

16:51.791 --> 16:53.458
Okay, here's what we do.

16:53.541 --> 16:57.166
We bring them coffee,
but the sugar packets are poison.

16:57.250 --> 16:59.666
-That was in <i>Breaking Bad.</i>
-I'm not writing that down.

16:59.750 --> 17:03.041
Oh! Oh, oh! We put them all on a plane,
then, it crashes on an island.

17:03.125 --> 17:06.333
Then, they have to live together,
but it's actually purgatory.

17:06.416 --> 17:09.000
Stop pitching plots of TV shows.

17:09.083 --> 17:12.041
Why? TV shows bailed me
out of trouble dozens of times.

17:12.125 --> 17:14.750
I've beaten two DUIs off <i>Matlock</i> alone,

17:14.833 --> 17:16.750
and beaten off to <i>Matlock </i>alone.

17:16.833 --> 17:20.500
Wait, that's it! <i>Matlock!</i>
We need to do this legally.

17:20.583 --> 17:23.500
If we can prove ownership,
we can threaten them with a lawsuit!

17:23.583 --> 17:26.750
Bingo! What we need is a patent lawyer.

17:26.833 --> 17:28.875
Where the hell are we gonna
find one of those?

17:28.958 --> 17:32.500
Um, didn't you date a patent lawyer,
like, very recently?

17:32.583 --> 17:34.666
Oh, yeah! Stewart!

17:35.708 --> 17:38.625
Anyhoo, that's the gist of our problem.

17:39.291 --> 17:40.958
God, you look good, man.

17:41.041 --> 17:43.750
-What was I thinking?
-Focus, damn it!

17:43.833 --> 17:45.375
So, what do you think?

17:45.458 --> 17:49.083
Sounds like you need to file an injunction
to protect your product.

17:49.166 --> 17:50.708
Yes! Will this work?

17:50.791 --> 17:53.625
If they don't agree to step aside,
we'll see them in court.

17:53.708 --> 17:56.375
Legally speaking, this is a slam dunk.

17:56.458 --> 17:58.541
Fuck yeah! Swish!

17:58.625 --> 18:01.833
See? I told you these guys
were no match for my buddy, Stewart.

18:01.916 --> 18:03.333
Aw, thanks, Diane.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.708
Just out of curiosity,
who is the other party?

18:05.791 --> 18:07.666
It's, like, these Polish gangsters.

18:09.041 --> 18:12.250
I wouldn't even joke about that,
those guys are notoriously brutal.

18:12.333 --> 18:14.083
Anyway, I'll get these drawn up.

18:16.916 --> 18:20.041
Okay, so, you're telling me my 401is--

18:20.125 --> 18:22.375
<i>A four-oh-none-k.</i>

18:22.458 --> 18:23.708
Jesus Christ!

18:23.791 --> 18:27.416
So, no retirement, my savings
were all tied up in company stock.

18:27.500 --> 18:29.000
What am I supposed to do?

18:29.083 --> 18:30.500
Mark, great news!

18:30.583 --> 18:31.666
I got the job!

18:33.583 --> 18:35.291
Mark, you're crying.

18:36.083 --> 18:40.875
I'm just… so happy for you.
That's all it is.

18:40.958 --> 18:42.125
I'm so excited!

18:42.208 --> 18:43.333
It's not a lot of pay,

18:43.416 --> 18:46.041
but for the first time in years,
I feel alive!

18:46.125 --> 18:47.916
That's so great!

18:48.000 --> 18:49.916
Hey, how much money is it, exactly?

18:50.000 --> 18:52.500
Don't worry, Mark,
you're still the big breadwinner.

18:52.583 --> 18:53.750
By, like, a mile.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.416
Great. Good.

18:56.500 --> 18:58.833
I'm gonna go buy some pencil skirts!

19:01.958 --> 19:04.458
Pack it up, boys. This shit's over!

19:05.041 --> 19:06.833
What is the meaning of this?

19:06.916 --> 19:10.375
Well, Stan, we got a little thing
called a "pattern."

19:10.458 --> 19:12.500
"Patent!" My God!

19:12.583 --> 19:16.000
And this is an injunction
filed on our behalf,

19:16.083 --> 19:19.708
which will hold up in court
over any handshake deal.

19:19.791 --> 19:21.541
May I see this, please?

19:25.166 --> 19:28.041
Oh my God! That was laminated!

19:30.958 --> 19:33.833
We're not going anywhere!

19:35.166 --> 19:36.875
I am back!

19:37.958 --> 19:39.375
Stanislas?

19:39.458 --> 19:40.791
<i>Ciocia </i>Zuzana?

19:40.875 --> 19:42.125
You know him?

19:42.208 --> 19:43.166
He is nephew.

19:43.250 --> 19:46.375
Jesus! They really do all know each other!

19:46.458 --> 19:48.166
Well, I hope you two get along

19:48.250 --> 19:51.916
because apparently, he's me and Gideon's
new business partner!

19:52.000 --> 19:56.250
-Ow! Ow!!

20:11.666 --> 20:13.333
My apologies.

20:14.458 --> 20:15.291
Ow!

20:20.416 --> 20:21.875
Damn, Zuzana!

20:21.958 --> 20:25.416
Yeah! You really had to give away
all those pierogies?

20:25.500 --> 20:28.458
Thank you, Zuzana, for your protections.

20:28.541 --> 20:31.166
Well, looks like Diane fixed another one.

20:31.250 --> 20:33.375
What? You did nothing.

20:33.458 --> 20:36.875
Exactly. And we're still on the hook
for that Borough order.

20:36.958 --> 20:38.583
What are we going to do?

20:38.666 --> 20:41.291
We don't have a beef fat hookup now.

20:41.375 --> 20:43.583
Pardon me,
I have to drain fluid from feet.

20:43.666 --> 20:45.500
They are like sausages.

20:45.583 --> 20:47.583
Long flight, layover in Vienna.

20:47.666 --> 20:49.625
Man next to me have diarrhea.

20:49.708 --> 20:50.916
Wait a second.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.125
Vienna.

20:52.208 --> 20:53.833
Sausages.

20:53.916 --> 20:55.208
Diarrhea!

20:55.291 --> 20:56.875
I know what we gotta do!

20:57.458 --> 21:00.375
Amazing first day, Bonnie!
You! Killed! It!

21:00.458 --> 21:04.583
This dog wedding
is going to be off the chain!

21:04.666 --> 21:06.333
More like "off the leash!"

21:06.416 --> 21:07.958
Yes!

21:08.041 --> 21:10.125
-Uh! My Uber's pulling up. Bye!

21:13.250 --> 21:14.708
Can I offer you a water?

21:14.791 --> 21:16.791
No, thank you, I'm-- Mark?

21:16.875 --> 21:18.083
Bonnie?

21:19.583 --> 21:22.333
You have every right to be angry
at me for not telling you.

21:22.416 --> 21:24.375
I just didn't want you
to think less of me.

21:24.458 --> 21:26.333
I'm not angry, honey.

21:26.416 --> 21:28.625
And now, we're both restarting.

21:28.708 --> 21:30.666
We're gonna do this together.

21:31.458 --> 21:33.208
We're a team.

21:33.708 --> 21:34.666
We're a team.

21:35.166 --> 21:37.333
-Are you coming in?

21:37.416 --> 21:39.916
Actually, I have an airport pickup at…

21:40.791 --> 21:42.166
Munster, Indiana?

21:42.250 --> 21:43.708
Oh, come on!

21:45.000 --> 21:47.250
Sweet peppers are better by far!

21:47.333 --> 21:49.416
Not a chance! Hot peppers all day!

21:52.708 --> 21:57.416
Guys! Guys!
We can't have this debate every day!

21:58.458 --> 22:01.458
Ladies and gentlemen,
may we please take a moment of your time?

22:01.541 --> 22:02.750
Call security!

22:02.833 --> 22:04.916
Wait! We need your beef fat.

22:05.000 --> 22:08.833
Beef fat that you've been
paying top dollar to dispose of.

22:08.916 --> 22:11.708
So, we take it off your hands,
free of charge.

22:11.791 --> 22:15.041
To quote Warren Buffett,
this is "mutually beneficial."

22:15.125 --> 22:18.791
And to quote Jimmy Buffett,
"How did you get backstage?"

22:18.875 --> 22:21.750
So, whaddya say, folks? Do we have a deal?

22:25.125 --> 22:28.125
Thanks for buying this.
It's the first piece I've sold in years.

22:28.208 --> 22:29.958
I'm glad it found its home.

22:30.041 --> 22:33.833
And I am going to treat myself
and get my water turned back on.

22:33.916 --> 22:36.875
It's bath time for Samuel!

22:37.708 --> 22:39.625
Diane, when I first met you, I had a hunch

22:39.708 --> 22:42.541
that one day, we'd be dragging
coolers full of beef fat

22:42.625 --> 22:44.708
into your busted-ass apartment together.

22:44.791 --> 22:45.791
Really?

22:45.875 --> 22:49.458
No!
But I'm strangely glad we are.

22:49.541 --> 22:52.416
Forget making art, let's make some lotion!

22:52.500 --> 22:54.916
Yep, I'll put on my work clothes.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.291
-Ah!

22:56.375 --> 22:59.625
Oh my God, those are not tear-away pants!

22:59.708 --> 23:02.333
<i>I think I ripped some of my taint.</i>
