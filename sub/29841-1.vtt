NETFLIX PRESENTS

00:42.333 --> 00:43.583
Go!

00:45.625 --> 00:46.625
Drive!

00:51.333 --> 00:52.583
Come on!

00:52.666 --> 00:53.666
Get in!

00:56.416 --> 00:57.416
Mehdi!

01:00.375 --> 01:01.541
Shit!

01:03.291 --> 01:04.583
Fuckers!

01:05.916 --> 01:07.375
Mehdi!

01:08.583 --> 01:09.500
C'mon!

01:12.708 --> 01:13.875
I can't move!

01:14.750 --> 01:17.333
I can't move. Leave me!

01:18.708 --> 01:21.708
Leave me. Just leave me.

01:25.583 --> 01:27.000
Where's Mehdi?

01:27.416 --> 01:28.708
He's down.

01:28.791 --> 01:29.791
Don't move!

01:31.375 --> 01:32.583
Don't move!

01:45.833 --> 01:49.625
15 YEARS LATER

02:31.666 --> 02:33.666
Fuck me! How's it going, bro?

02:34.208 --> 02:35.916
You're looking good.

02:41.416 --> 02:43.250
-Good flight?
-Yeah.

02:44.625 --> 02:45.833
Look at you.

02:45.916 --> 02:47.208
Give me that.

02:47.708 --> 02:50.000
Sit on that side.

02:50.583 --> 02:52.000
Like in England.

02:59.125 --> 03:01.500
-It's paradise here.
-So I hear.

03:01.583 --> 03:03.458
You'll soon get the hang of it.

03:32.500 --> 03:34.791
Hurry up, Dad is here.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.083
You OK?

03:50.458 --> 03:52.666
Sean, Noam, and my wife.

03:55.458 --> 03:56.708
Run along.

04:13.791 --> 04:16.125
This is <i>tom yam kung</i>,

04:16.208 --> 04:18.250
a traditional Thai dish.

04:18.333 --> 04:22.458
It's a shrimp soup.
Careful, it's very spicy.

04:24.583 --> 04:25.750
Use a spoon.

04:29.125 --> 04:30.666
You speak good French.

04:30.750 --> 04:33.708
Thanks. My mother's Swiss
and my father's Thai.

04:33.791 --> 04:35.083
That explains it.

04:35.583 --> 04:37.916
I thought my brother had taught you.

04:39.125 --> 04:40.958
He was a lousy student.

04:43.166 --> 04:45.291
That's <i>thot man kung</i>,shrimp cakes.

04:46.791 --> 04:48.833
-Do you eat just shrimp?
-No.

04:48.916 --> 04:51.458
There's everything, even French cheese.

04:51.708 --> 04:55.083
I don't need to tell you,
this is your home, too.

04:55.583 --> 04:56.666
I know.

05:10.833 --> 05:12.083
Excuse me.

05:17.041 --> 05:19.666
How did you find a hot chick like that?

05:19.750 --> 05:21.833
We're French here, not Arabs.

05:21.916 --> 05:24.500
They don't think of us as terrorists.

05:27.583 --> 05:29.166
Her dad's a big businessman.

05:30.375 --> 05:32.125
<i>He's a jerk. We don't talk.</i>

05:32.708 --> 05:33.833
<i>He never accepted me.</i>

05:34.041 --> 05:35.458
I'm just a <i>falang</i>.

05:37.125 --> 05:39.125
At least I had money.

05:40.541 --> 05:41.416
<i>"Falang"?</i>

05:41.708 --> 05:43.916
A Frenchman, a shitty foreigner.

05:44.208 --> 05:46.250
But it's good for business.

05:46.333 --> 05:48.916
Her half-brother is the head of police.

05:49.958 --> 05:51.208
<i>So, my brother's in league</i>

05:51.291 --> 05:52.875
with the cops.

05:52.958 --> 05:54.375
It's not like that.

05:54.458 --> 05:58.500
I didn't choose my in-laws,
but I tell you, here...

05:59.208 --> 06:01.083
having protection

06:01.333 --> 06:04.041
makes life easier. You need their help.

06:10.833 --> 06:12.041
Kiss your uncle.

06:12.125 --> 06:13.541
Say goodnight.

06:27.250 --> 06:28.708
They're cute kids.

06:29.125 --> 06:31.041
I didn't know you had any.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.458
Well, you told us not to contact you.

06:36.958 --> 06:39.500
Are you tired? Your room's all ready.

06:40.750 --> 06:42.083
I need some air.

06:42.333 --> 06:45.416
-I'll come with you.
-No, I'd rather be alone.

06:47.291 --> 06:49.333
I'll call Songchai, the driver.

06:54.041 --> 06:57.125
My number's in that.
Call me if you need me.

06:57.208 --> 06:59.500
And cash to have some fun.

06:59.583 --> 07:02.291
He'll take you to the bars in Bangla.

07:02.375 --> 07:05.125
Go to the Money Night, it's Zak's bar.

07:06.375 --> 07:08.083
We need to talk tomorrow.

07:19.583 --> 07:21.916
Why didn't you mention your brother?

07:22.000 --> 07:24.458
I haven't seen him in 15 years.

07:24.541 --> 07:26.958
Are you hiding anything else?

07:27.041 --> 07:28.208
No.

07:28.583 --> 07:32.166
He did some bad stuff.
I didn't want to talk about it.

07:35.333 --> 07:38.666
Forget it, it's ancient history, OK?

07:38.958 --> 07:41.125
He's always protected me.

07:41.208 --> 07:44.791
You always said
your childhood was complicated.

07:45.333 --> 07:47.875
Yeah, that's putting it mildly.

07:51.041 --> 07:52.458
Is there a problem?

07:55.083 --> 07:56.583
There's no problem.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.708
It's up to you, darling.

08:25.833 --> 08:28.291
Yo, Hicham. How's it hangin', dude?

08:30.291 --> 08:31.916
Why bring her along?

08:32.333 --> 08:34.708
It's OK, she won't disturb us.

08:35.666 --> 08:37.833
It disturbs me. I wanted to talk.

08:39.583 --> 08:40.791
What's going on?

08:44.541 --> 08:45.666
Mehdi's back.

08:46.875 --> 08:48.291
Mehdi's out of prison.

08:52.166 --> 08:53.916
Mehdi, your brother?

08:54.000 --> 08:55.958
Who else? Know any others?

08:56.250 --> 08:57.416
Shit, sorry.

08:57.958 --> 08:59.208
Is he OK?

09:00.125 --> 09:01.666
He looked well.

09:03.250 --> 09:04.583
Fifteen years, man.

09:05.291 --> 09:07.666
-They flew by.
-Maybe not for him.

09:08.375 --> 09:11.166
I'm glad for you that he's back.

09:12.583 --> 09:14.208
I hope he behaves.

09:19.791 --> 09:20.875
Did he mention me?

09:22.250 --> 09:23.625
Not you or anyone.

09:27.166 --> 09:28.791
The devil is back.

09:30.958 --> 09:31.833
Where is he?

09:33.833 --> 09:35.000
At Patong.

10:21.875 --> 10:24.541
-Cute, isn't she?
-What?

10:24.625 --> 10:27.458
-The whores ain't enough for you?
-What?

10:27.541 --> 10:29.875
-Who let you touch her?
-Calm down.

10:29.958 --> 10:32.041
Am I touching her, fuckin' asshole?

10:33.583 --> 10:34.750
My love...

10:35.625 --> 10:36.875
Let me see.

10:43.208 --> 10:45.583
Goyave, take Winny to ER, he's bleeding.

10:45.666 --> 10:46.833
Come on, Winny.

11:54.833 --> 11:56.916
Mehdi, no way!

11:57.000 --> 11:58.333
I don't believe it!

11:58.583 --> 12:00.750
Good to see you, man.

12:00.833 --> 12:04.916
I was sitting there, thinking
that guy looked just like Mehdi.

12:06.333 --> 12:07.875
Meet the guys.

12:25.125 --> 12:26.666
You can have Awa.

12:26.750 --> 12:28.375
She's gorgeous.

12:28.458 --> 12:30.875
She's a sex bomb.

12:31.375 --> 12:33.666
I'm not here for the whores.

12:33.958 --> 12:37.458
They're princesses, not whores!
They're hot chicks.

12:37.541 --> 12:40.333
You can't imagine what they can do.

12:40.416 --> 12:42.000
I've had 15 years to imagine them.

12:42.083 --> 12:44.583
Mamma mia, look at that.

12:48.875 --> 12:50.291
Look at that.

13:08.208 --> 13:10.708
In Thai, "Mehdi" means "no good"!

13:11.000 --> 13:14.208
And your brother Hicham
is "smashed pussy".

13:14.708 --> 13:18.625
-This is no place for us.
-It's for everyone. It's paradise.

13:18.708 --> 13:21.916
Fifteen years!
It's the happiest day of my life.

13:22.708 --> 13:24.208
We gotta celebrate.

13:55.791 --> 13:56.958
He's out of it.

13:57.416 --> 13:59.166
Most people love it here.

13:59.708 --> 14:01.583
Look, he saved my life.

14:01.666 --> 14:04.041
-So?
-I'm here thanks to him.

14:04.333 --> 14:06.208
-He looks like death.
-Hey!

15:01.125 --> 15:02.916
Don't wake him up.

15:03.875 --> 15:05.125
Oh, wow!

15:05.416 --> 15:09.000
He looks like Sleeping Beauty
after a 15-year siesta!

15:10.791 --> 15:12.375
Who'll kiss him first?!

15:13.333 --> 15:14.583
Asshole!

15:31.666 --> 15:33.416
Do I look stupid?

15:33.500 --> 15:36.041
No, the flowers suit you.

15:37.250 --> 15:38.500
Look at that.

15:39.041 --> 15:40.958
The sea, the chicks, business...

15:41.833 --> 15:43.083
Sweet as a peach.

15:43.791 --> 15:45.791
I hated it when things were sweet.

15:46.125 --> 15:47.583
Never drop your guard.

15:48.833 --> 15:52.416
You'll laugh, but I thought
it was a gay thing.

15:52.666 --> 15:54.541
-I took up golf.
-Oh, yeah?

15:54.958 --> 15:56.083
It calms me.

15:56.166 --> 15:59.250
Having a goal,
keeping your concentration...

15:59.541 --> 16:02.291
Yet relaxed and laid back.

16:03.416 --> 16:05.125
At the end of your move,

16:07.166 --> 16:09.583
your solar plexus is in tune.

16:10.333 --> 16:12.916
And the aim is to put the ball

16:13.250 --> 16:14.625
in the hole. So cool.

16:15.500 --> 16:17.375
Yeah, and you do it good!

16:18.041 --> 16:19.708
The swing, man!

16:19.958 --> 16:21.916
You mustn't mix up the hole

16:22.291 --> 16:23.875
with your asshole!

16:26.791 --> 16:29.083
Or the hole a bullet will make.

16:31.625 --> 16:32.833
Not as much fun.

16:39.333 --> 16:40.500
Slim...

16:41.416 --> 16:43.083
When do we eat?

16:43.166 --> 16:44.708
Not now.

16:50.833 --> 16:52.166
Incoming!

17:17.958 --> 17:19.208
So good!

17:19.541 --> 17:22.000
They're all good. That's the problem!

18:05.750 --> 18:07.166
Oh, fuck me!

18:10.291 --> 18:12.083
Yeah, you can laugh!

18:15.625 --> 18:18.125
I've waited 15 years for that.

18:18.208 --> 18:19.833
Where's my share?

18:20.666 --> 18:23.500
Give me my share,
then I'll go back to France.

18:23.583 --> 18:25.625
This is where it's at, not France.

18:26.958 --> 18:28.000
Are you deaf?

18:28.083 --> 18:29.041
My share!

18:29.375 --> 18:30.458
We'll explain.

18:30.875 --> 18:31.750
What?

18:32.250 --> 18:34.041
We got 2.5 million,

18:34.125 --> 18:35.375
the six of us.

18:35.458 --> 18:36.833
You kept me 400,000.

18:36.916 --> 18:39.458
It's more complicated. How can I put it?

18:40.125 --> 18:42.750
There was a big recession. It's all gone.

18:42.833 --> 18:45.208
We had to rebuild after the tsunami.

18:45.583 --> 18:47.333
What're you talking about?

18:47.416 --> 18:50.625
-You look like you're doing OK.
-Thank God.

18:50.875 --> 18:54.083
Leave God out of it.
I did 15 years for you fuckers.

18:54.166 --> 18:55.291
We know that.

18:55.375 --> 18:58.083
You just screwed whores all that time!

18:59.916 --> 19:02.041
-Wait...
-What?

19:02.541 --> 19:04.083
People die of hunger.

19:04.500 --> 19:05.958
It's not my problem.

19:06.041 --> 19:08.083
-Shut up.
-Screw this!

19:10.583 --> 19:13.500
Four hundred grand for a 15-year stretch
ain't much.

19:13.583 --> 19:15.333
That's 2,222 per month.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Couldn't you protect my assets?

19:18.083 --> 19:20.666
-Am I a piece of shit?
-Calm down.

19:20.750 --> 19:23.250
I have no cash. We'll sell stuff.

19:23.333 --> 19:26.291
We need some time. Nothing's in my name.

19:26.375 --> 19:29.791
It all belongs to my wife:
the boat, house, golf course.

19:31.250 --> 19:33.291
-What's this crap?
-It's true.

19:33.375 --> 19:35.416
You can't own a business here.

19:35.500 --> 19:38.041
Gotta put it in your chick's name

19:38.125 --> 19:41.958
or you work with Thais who rip you off.
It ain't easy.

19:42.041 --> 19:43.916
I don't give a fuck.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.541
You got a golf course!

19:45.916 --> 19:47.250
We got shares in one.

19:48.083 --> 19:51.125
Not bad for a coke dealer
who was our driver!

19:51.208 --> 19:52.625
Yeah, yeah.

19:54.500 --> 19:58.041
Goyave, pull your head out of your ass.
Speak up.

19:58.375 --> 19:59.375
<i>Sabai, sabai.</i>

19:59.833 --> 20:01.291
What does that mean?

20:01.375 --> 20:02.958
Everything's chill.

20:05.375 --> 20:06.875
There's a problem, guys.

20:07.166 --> 20:10.833
<i>Sabai, sabai!</i>
There's a fuckin' big problem!

20:11.208 --> 20:14.291
-This sucks.
-Are you only waking up now?

20:14.958 --> 20:17.458
You all agreed to take his share.

20:17.541 --> 20:18.666
Shut up, you!

20:18.750 --> 20:20.541
When we lost everything...

20:20.625 --> 20:21.916
Shut up!

20:22.000 --> 20:23.500
Yeah, I'll shut up.

20:28.083 --> 20:29.166
Don't cry.

20:30.458 --> 20:32.250
Julia, please, don't cry.

20:35.125 --> 20:36.750
Fly to Phuket.

20:37.250 --> 20:38.708
I'll pay you back.

20:40.250 --> 20:41.833
It'll be OK, don't worry.

20:41.916 --> 20:46.125
-Hey, we'll work it out, Mehdi.
-You said I'd get the hang of it.

20:46.833 --> 20:49.666
-I think I have.
-No, you haven't!

20:49.750 --> 20:54.208
I didn't marry her father or brother.
They're bleeding me dry.

20:55.958 --> 20:58.000
-What's their cut?
-Seventy percent.

20:58.083 --> 21:00.458
-You're joking.
-Do I look like I am?

21:01.666 --> 21:04.583
-What's his cut?
-I don't take a thing.

21:04.666 --> 21:06.500
We're partners. Fifty-fifty.

21:07.375 --> 21:10.208
Out of the remaining thirty percent,
he takes half.

21:10.291 --> 21:13.291
Fifteen percent of your business
ain't much.

21:13.375 --> 21:14.583
And you?

21:14.666 --> 21:19.000
I have a restaurant, the Paradise Beach.
I sell hamburgers and pizzas

21:19.083 --> 21:20.666
to guys like us.

21:20.750 --> 21:23.291
I got two clubs. You saw the Money Night.

21:23.375 --> 21:26.208
But Goyave has got nothing left.

21:26.625 --> 21:27.750
Oh, yeah?

21:28.041 --> 21:30.750
I lost the lot. I'm lucky: they help me.

21:30.833 --> 21:33.708
-How come?
-I'll tell you some time.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.250
OK, so, apart from him,
you're all businessmen.

21:41.125 --> 21:43.083
I gotta join in, too.

21:43.166 --> 21:44.791
Mehdi, please...

21:44.875 --> 21:48.750
A vacation will do you good.
We're all here together.

21:49.291 --> 21:54.500
Enjoy yourself. Stop yelling at everyone
and being miserable. Please...

22:09.666 --> 22:12.166
I'll give you the two bars at Patong.

22:12.250 --> 22:14.541
But take the problems, too.

22:14.625 --> 22:15.791
What problems?

22:15.875 --> 22:20.083
These two-bit punks came
five years ago and never left.

22:20.166 --> 22:23.166
They're stealing my girls.
Seven of 'em so far.

22:23.250 --> 22:25.458
-Arabs?
-No, blacks.

22:25.750 --> 22:29.166
-And you do nothing?
-I want a quiet life here.

22:29.250 --> 22:32.708
If I touch one of them,
they'll trash the place.

22:32.791 --> 22:36.791
-What would you do?
-What we always fuckin' did.

22:37.625 --> 22:39.166
It won't be easy.

22:41.250 --> 22:44.000
If you think violence
doesn't solve things,

22:44.083 --> 22:46.083
you didn't hit hard enough.

22:48.041 --> 22:49.708
That's the old you!

22:50.708 --> 22:52.166
You can count on me.

23:05.875 --> 23:07.416
Are you Moussa?

23:16.208 --> 23:18.166
Listen to me.

23:19.625 --> 23:21.166
Listen, fucker.

23:21.250 --> 23:24.166
I'm taking over the Money Night.
Bring back

23:24.250 --> 23:26.791
the girls you took, understand?

23:27.083 --> 23:28.958
Next time, you're dead!

23:40.541 --> 23:42.541
What do you want to eat?

23:42.625 --> 23:45.333
-What you got?
-Hamburgers, pizza...

23:45.416 --> 23:46.416
Hamburger.

23:46.500 --> 23:48.125
-Rare?
-Yeah.

23:48.791 --> 23:50.583
-<i>Pla duk foo</i>.
-OK.

23:53.208 --> 23:55.500
-Two <i>pla duk foo</i>.
-You got it.

23:56.333 --> 23:58.375
Why are you out on your ass?

23:59.125 --> 24:00.041
That beach...

24:01.000 --> 24:03.500
There were bodies everywhere. A mess.

24:03.791 --> 24:06.000
I stayed in Phuket during the tsunami.

24:06.083 --> 24:08.833
It took me ten days
to find my wife's body.

24:09.458 --> 24:10.708
Ten days!

24:12.458 --> 24:16.583
Then, I helped the Thais rebuild.
I'd lost everything.

24:17.875 --> 24:19.083
And the others?

24:19.458 --> 24:21.291
They went to Bangkok.

24:29.833 --> 24:31.083
You saved her?

24:31.666 --> 24:33.083
She's like my daughter.

24:34.291 --> 24:36.958
She was two
when I pulled her out of the mud.

24:37.291 --> 24:39.833
Only her little hand was sticking out.

24:41.083 --> 24:43.208
Her folks are dead, so I raise her.

24:47.791 --> 24:51.041
I swear, if I had any money,
I'd give it to you.

24:52.083 --> 24:53.583
I've nothing to lose.

24:55.250 --> 24:56.291
Except her.

24:58.541 --> 24:59.583
She's pretty.

25:03.708 --> 25:05.250
So pretty, I could cry.

25:05.541 --> 25:07.125
I want her to study

25:07.208 --> 25:09.458
and not end up like some girls

25:09.541 --> 25:11.750
who sell their asses to jerks.

25:13.583 --> 25:15.000
That's good, bro.

25:16.333 --> 25:17.458
Very good.

25:18.916 --> 25:20.166
It's OK.

27:58.625 --> 28:01.208
-Who was it?
-My brother invited us.

28:01.291 --> 28:02.458
Oh, no!

28:03.416 --> 28:05.708
I don't want to. Go without me.

28:05.791 --> 28:09.291
Oh, no, I'm not leaving you.
You're coming with me.

28:09.375 --> 28:11.250
-Who's going?
-Everyone.

28:11.333 --> 28:12.833
Who's "everyone"?

28:13.708 --> 28:14.791
Everyone.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.041
Will anyone remember my name?

28:20.166 --> 28:23.291
When I was in the shit, they abandoned me.

28:23.375 --> 28:24.708
Even your brother.

28:25.875 --> 28:27.333
They had no choice.

28:49.958 --> 28:51.625
-Who's he?
-Pichai.

28:51.708 --> 28:54.916
-Aom's half-brother, police chief.
-He takes your money?

28:57.000 --> 28:58.166
Quiet.

28:58.250 --> 28:59.500
What did he say?

28:59.583 --> 29:01.291
Are you here as a tourist

29:01.375 --> 29:03.083
or do you want to live here?

29:49.625 --> 29:52.208
Stop kissing that dog. It's gross.

29:52.291 --> 29:53.541
Are you jealous?

29:54.375 --> 29:55.625
Think it's funny?

29:56.125 --> 29:57.375
Did I say, laugh?

29:58.000 --> 29:59.208
Stop it, hon.

29:59.291 --> 30:02.791
Stop what? You're making
a spectacle of yourself.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.291
-Hands on your head.
-What?

30:06.541 --> 30:08.125
Hands on your head!

30:09.500 --> 30:12.333
-You're joking, Winny.
-Do I look like I am?

30:12.416 --> 30:13.958
Hands on your head!

30:15.916 --> 30:19.375
Right, I'll tell you
when you can take them off.

30:19.916 --> 30:21.416
Feeding fish to her mutt!

30:22.708 --> 30:23.833
Keep 'em up

30:23.916 --> 30:25.666
till the dessert. I'll show you.

30:35.291 --> 30:37.291
Take 'em down, you dumb bitch.

30:40.416 --> 30:42.125
Some haven't changed.

30:47.625 --> 30:48.750
To friendship.

30:50.083 --> 30:51.250
To my brother.

30:51.958 --> 30:54.416
To my friends. Those who didn't forget me.

30:54.708 --> 30:56.125
No-one forgot you.

30:57.750 --> 30:59.000
To Julia who stayed true.

31:00.166 --> 31:01.750
She wrote every day.

31:01.833 --> 31:03.500
She warmed my heart.

31:04.083 --> 31:06.458
She wiped people's asses in a hospice

31:06.541 --> 31:08.166
while you lazed in the sun.

31:09.083 --> 31:11.666
All I'll do from now on is for you.

31:11.750 --> 31:13.166
I swear.

31:19.625 --> 31:20.625
Very moving.

31:20.875 --> 31:21.791
What?

31:33.833 --> 31:35.708
-They wanna see you.
-Oh, yeah?

31:41.125 --> 31:42.208
You beat him up?

31:43.875 --> 31:45.291
I went to say hi.

31:51.750 --> 31:55.583
Listen, next time you behave like that,
I'll stab you.

31:56.333 --> 31:57.500
What was that?

31:57.583 --> 32:01.583
We were dining with my brother-in-law
to protect your ass.

32:01.666 --> 32:03.458
Cut that crap.

32:03.541 --> 32:04.833
It's my business.

32:04.916 --> 32:07.416
Do I criticize friends who screw ladyboys?

32:07.500 --> 32:09.125
No, I keep my mouth shut.

32:09.208 --> 32:12.375
You're the only jerk here
with a French whore.

32:12.458 --> 32:15.291
I do things differently. Know what I hate?

32:15.375 --> 32:17.916
Guys who screw Thai whores.

32:18.000 --> 32:21.250
And when your wife disses me,
and you keep quiet.

32:21.333 --> 32:24.625
Now listen, when my wife is right,
I let her speak.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.500
You were a pig. I wanted to batter you.

32:27.583 --> 32:29.583
Did you? Well, be my guest.

32:29.833 --> 32:33.166
Get out of my sight.
You've caused enough trouble.

32:33.250 --> 32:35.333
I'm the one causing trouble?

32:35.625 --> 32:38.708
Since your brother came back,
you've been on edge.

32:51.625 --> 32:53.166
See you soon.

32:54.166 --> 32:55.666
-Good to see you.
-Yeah.

32:55.750 --> 32:58.250
-I mean it.
-Your wife's very pretty.

32:58.333 --> 32:59.541
Thank you.

33:02.833 --> 33:03.875
I'll come tomorrow.

33:03.958 --> 33:06.625
No need, stay with your family.

33:18.250 --> 33:20.625
<i>What was Mehdi's guilt trip about?</i>

33:21.083 --> 33:23.500
-It's only natural.
-Yeah, right.

33:23.958 --> 33:26.250
Let's put our cards on the table.

33:26.333 --> 33:31.500
We did that holdup. It went to shit.
It could've been you, me or Winny.

33:31.583 --> 33:34.750
Is it your fault? Or my fault?
Look at me. Am I?

33:34.833 --> 33:36.041
No. So?

33:36.416 --> 33:38.500
-He wants the lot.
-His share.

33:38.583 --> 33:40.750
It's only natural. He'll get it.

33:40.833 --> 33:42.958
How are you gonna do that?

33:43.500 --> 33:46.000
We've nothing to sell. What'll you do?

33:46.083 --> 33:49.125
-Nothing's in your name.
-Just cut the crap.

33:50.458 --> 33:52.583
What do you think of my brother?

33:53.125 --> 33:54.958
What did you say, honey?

33:55.041 --> 33:57.041
What do you think of my brother?

33:57.125 --> 33:58.291
He looks lost.

34:03.666 --> 34:05.833
I saw hate in your eyes.

34:08.458 --> 34:10.166
Don't do anything stupid.

34:10.791 --> 34:13.916
-I couldn't stand it.
-I know what I'm doing.

34:14.416 --> 34:17.750
I can't accept some things.
It's a matter of principle.

34:19.208 --> 34:21.458
You and your principles!

34:23.875 --> 34:25.708
You haven't changed.

34:26.125 --> 34:27.458
That's good, isn't it?

34:55.375 --> 34:56.541
You've bulked up.

34:58.125 --> 35:00.083
Gotta look after yourself.

35:00.583 --> 35:02.208
OK, kids.

35:09.666 --> 35:11.166
I got something to say.

35:14.708 --> 35:17.375
I killed that cop 15 years ago.

35:18.708 --> 35:19.625
<i>I did it.</i>

35:20.916 --> 35:22.250
Why say that?

35:23.000 --> 35:24.750
'Cause it's hard for me.

35:26.291 --> 35:29.583
You should've had the life I've had here.

35:31.041 --> 35:34.750
You did 15 years to protect us.
I dunno what to say to you.

35:38.666 --> 35:41.375
-I've fucked up.
-Now listen, Hicham...

35:41.833 --> 35:44.250
I paid for everyone else, period.

35:44.333 --> 35:46.291
Now you all have to pay, OK?

35:47.041 --> 35:48.291
I know.

35:48.375 --> 35:50.416
Just give me some time.

35:50.500 --> 35:54.083
I was so fuckin' happy
to see you guys again.

35:54.166 --> 35:57.958
But now I gotta think
about Julia and myself, see?

35:58.375 --> 36:02.541
I feel like my back's against the wall.
I don't like that, bro.

36:03.250 --> 36:04.416
I know.

36:05.083 --> 36:06.750
Find a solution, and fast.

36:36.458 --> 36:38.166
Alright, Dango?

36:38.250 --> 36:40.291
-OK, guys?
-Yeah.

36:40.666 --> 36:43.416
Take a seat. Want a drink?

36:45.750 --> 36:47.166
Turn the music down.

36:47.458 --> 36:49.250
Does it bother you? Good, huh?

36:49.500 --> 36:50.916
The new generation.

36:51.000 --> 36:54.708
More aggressive.
They waste old school guys like you.

36:54.791 --> 36:56.166
Not surprising.

36:56.250 --> 36:58.625
Hey, we're here to work things out.

36:59.166 --> 37:01.125
-You wanted to talk?
-Yeah.

37:02.083 --> 37:03.791
I know you. People talk.

37:04.041 --> 37:05.083
I don't know you.

37:05.500 --> 37:08.291
We've all gotten along here
for five years.

37:08.375 --> 37:11.250
This isn't your place. What do you want?

37:11.583 --> 37:13.125
Gimme back the fuckin' girls.

37:13.416 --> 37:15.750
Don't talk to us like that, muhfuh!

37:16.250 --> 37:17.458
Shut up.

37:17.541 --> 37:18.583
I'll waste ya!

37:18.666 --> 37:20.791
What're you saying, man?

37:22.000 --> 37:23.333
How you gonna aim?

37:26.125 --> 37:28.875
Listen, the girls do what they want.

37:30.041 --> 37:32.666
If they wanna work here, it's up to them.

37:33.166 --> 37:35.250
Who'll stop 'em? You?!

37:35.583 --> 37:36.708
Dango, chill.

37:37.083 --> 37:38.458
I can get you girls.

37:38.541 --> 37:40.416
Think I need your help?

37:42.833 --> 37:43.791
You done?

37:45.958 --> 37:47.833
The chicks bring in the money.

37:49.125 --> 37:52.083
They're sick of working in dives
for fat slobs.

37:52.166 --> 37:53.583
We treat 'em good.

37:53.666 --> 37:54.958
By fuckin' them?

37:55.708 --> 37:57.875
I don't tread on people's toes,

37:57.958 --> 38:00.500
so don't tread on mine, understand?

38:02.625 --> 38:04.041
Stop that.

38:04.916 --> 38:06.541
Stop asking if I understand.

38:07.125 --> 38:08.666
Think I'm a moron?

38:10.083 --> 38:11.000
You threatening me?

38:11.958 --> 38:14.416
Guys, be cool. Look where we are.

38:15.333 --> 38:17.833
We're in Thailand. It's one big party!

38:19.375 --> 38:21.708
I want those girls back tomorrow.

38:24.208 --> 38:25.833
-I'll see.
-You'll do it.

38:34.250 --> 38:36.416
Slim, don't double-deal.

38:36.500 --> 38:39.791
-I like you.
-I'm just trying to fix things, bro.

38:39.875 --> 38:41.000
Yeah, sure.

38:43.208 --> 38:47.041
<i>Your brother and his pals</i>
<i>are real expats. They've gone soft.</i>

38:47.125 --> 38:51.250
Those guys are serious.
They've brought their trafficking here.

38:51.333 --> 38:54.833
It used to be Morocco and Spain.
Now here's where it's at.

38:54.916 --> 38:56.833
They don't give a fuck.

38:56.916 --> 39:00.125
They'd waste ya for nothing.
They got no principles.

39:00.458 --> 39:02.541
Yeah, I saw their type in jail.

39:02.625 --> 39:04.416
Mehdi, we'll work it out.

39:20.625 --> 39:21.791
Come here.

39:32.458 --> 39:33.791
Take your dress.

39:51.958 --> 39:53.166
You didn't understand.

39:53.250 --> 39:54.750
Yeah, I did.

39:55.458 --> 39:56.791
We paid her.

39:57.208 --> 39:59.708
We came in peace. They're whores.

39:59.791 --> 40:02.333
-Fuck off.
-Take it easy, old man.

40:02.416 --> 40:05.083
She's hot. She can have a good time.

40:05.708 --> 40:07.208
She makes me homesick.

40:07.291 --> 40:08.541
-So, go home.
-What?

40:09.000 --> 40:10.083
You gonna make me?

40:13.291 --> 40:14.458
Machetes?

40:16.708 --> 40:18.250
What're you playin' at?

40:18.666 --> 40:20.958
-Hey, whitie!
-You asshole!

40:21.041 --> 40:22.208
"Asshole"?

40:22.625 --> 40:24.375
-Watch out.
-I ain't scared.

40:24.458 --> 40:25.625
I'm shaking!

40:25.708 --> 40:28.458
Fuck off, the lot of you! Scram!

40:28.541 --> 40:29.833
Move!

40:29.916 --> 40:31.958
Hey, wise ass, we'll take you out.

40:32.041 --> 40:33.458
You'll take me out?

40:33.541 --> 40:35.375
Will you? Get out, asswipe!

40:35.750 --> 40:37.791
Go on, get out of my sight.

40:40.958 --> 40:42.250
We gotta move.

40:42.333 --> 40:46.208
They won't do anything. We have
too much to lose, to start a war.

41:02.166 --> 41:04.083
-Sorry.
-Where were you?

41:04.500 --> 41:05.791
At the Money Night.

41:06.250 --> 41:07.541
Screwing girls.

41:08.833 --> 41:10.416
Don't talk such crap.

41:11.916 --> 41:14.833
I was with European women
who get cheated on.

41:14.916 --> 41:16.041
That's good.

41:16.125 --> 41:18.125
Is it? Right, I'm off.

41:18.208 --> 41:21.083
I won't wait for you
while you're with chicks.

41:23.250 --> 41:26.833
Look, if you want to go whoring,
I can understand.

41:26.916 --> 41:29.166
You don't understand, dammit.

41:29.250 --> 41:30.500
What is this?

41:31.333 --> 41:33.208
I'm not some dumb bitch.

41:33.833 --> 41:37.041
Leave me here to party
with your pals in Phuket.

41:37.125 --> 41:39.583
It's perfect for pigs like you!

41:44.541 --> 41:46.458
I had problems to take care of.

41:47.791 --> 41:51.000
You always do. And you always will.

41:51.250 --> 41:53.166
It'll never change.

41:56.416 --> 41:58.125
-Julia...
-Leave me alone.

42:18.333 --> 42:20.500
I feel like it's 15 years ago.

42:21.583 --> 42:23.333
What happened?

42:25.458 --> 42:26.833
Nothing happened.

42:27.125 --> 42:28.166
You won't say?

42:29.708 --> 42:31.000
I've nothing to say.

42:33.416 --> 42:34.916
Your dad had money.

42:35.500 --> 42:38.208
They grew up in poverty, in foster homes.

42:39.666 --> 42:42.666
Mehdi and Hicham protected each other.

42:42.750 --> 42:44.625
And they always will.

42:45.125 --> 42:47.333
No-one can ever separate them.

43:18.083 --> 43:19.666
Why bring me here?

43:22.500 --> 43:24.333
I'll try to calm down.

43:24.583 --> 43:28.916
I need to deal with a few things,
then we can visit the islands.

43:29.291 --> 43:30.958
What're you waiting for?

43:32.250 --> 43:33.500
My money.

43:35.541 --> 43:37.750
You think they'll give it to you?

43:39.250 --> 43:41.291
If they don't, I'll take it.

43:41.583 --> 43:42.750
How?

43:53.708 --> 43:56.125
<i>Hello, Vinz. It's Mehdi.</i>

43:56.791 --> 43:58.208
<i>I need your help.</i>

43:58.833 --> 44:01.708
<i>Contact Pablo and get over here.</i>

44:02.125 --> 44:04.041
<i>Thailand, Phuket.</i>

44:04.125 --> 44:06.375
<i>Not Pattaya. Phuket, dammit.</i>

44:07.666 --> 44:09.500
Not to have fun.

44:10.458 --> 44:12.000
You've got it.

44:12.958 --> 44:14.625
I'm counting on you.

45:03.875 --> 45:04.791
Julia!

45:28.875 --> 45:31.083
They shot at kids!

46:53.958 --> 46:56.416
That mutt keeps sniffing my ass!

46:56.500 --> 46:58.875
-Careful.
-I'm sick of that dog.

46:58.958 --> 47:00.166
Careful!

47:10.041 --> 47:11.125
What?

47:16.416 --> 47:19.708
They killed Slim,
Tossa and Sombat like dogs.

47:19.791 --> 47:23.916
I know. They smashed up my restaurant.
It's a fuckin' wreck.

47:24.000 --> 47:25.750
Screw your restaurant.

47:26.041 --> 47:27.000
Now what?

47:29.458 --> 47:30.625
What do we do?

47:30.708 --> 47:34.125
-Nothing?
-There's a lot of them bastards.

47:34.208 --> 47:35.750
-Cut their heads off.
-What?

47:36.083 --> 47:39.416
-Dango and that other guy.
-Bodox. And the big Thai.

47:39.750 --> 47:41.125
That's it.

47:41.916 --> 47:43.458
-So?
-So, what?

47:45.250 --> 47:46.500
What're you after?

47:47.375 --> 47:49.208
What do you want us to do?

47:49.291 --> 47:51.125
You've never done a thing.

47:51.500 --> 47:52.750
You lost your balls?

47:52.833 --> 47:55.416
-That's not the problem.
-I think it is.

47:55.500 --> 47:57.875
If you go after them, so will I.

47:58.250 --> 47:59.500
It's not up to him.

47:59.791 --> 48:01.250
He has a wife and kids.

48:01.333 --> 48:03.666
We've led a quiet life for 15 years.

48:03.750 --> 48:05.791
We've lost the habit of war.

48:05.875 --> 48:08.875
When there's trouble,
there's just a few slaps.

48:09.291 --> 48:12.791
OK, so when there's a problem,
you let them slap you?

48:12.875 --> 48:17.166
They're just chicks.
Who cares about losing five or six whores?

48:17.250 --> 48:18.416
I'm raising hell?

48:18.500 --> 48:21.250
Why did you have to cause a shit storm?

48:21.333 --> 48:22.458
Shut up, Francky.

48:22.541 --> 48:24.583
-Guys...
-He's right.

48:25.041 --> 48:28.375
We can't let 'em fuck us over.
I'm with you.

48:29.083 --> 48:31.666
-You don't need to ask.
-Yeah, right!

48:43.250 --> 48:44.500
Hurry up.

48:47.416 --> 48:48.666
Get a move on.

48:52.291 --> 48:53.500
Bye, kids.

48:55.833 --> 48:57.041
Let's go.

50:49.666 --> 50:51.000
Good evening.

50:52.416 --> 50:54.083
She's my chick's mom.

50:54.875 --> 50:56.541
They won't find us here.

50:58.708 --> 51:00.500
<i>He's got us into a fine mess.</i>

51:01.125 --> 51:03.166
He's clearing up our mess.

51:03.250 --> 51:05.791
He's doing what we couldn't do.

51:06.125 --> 51:08.000
Did you hear what I said?

51:09.125 --> 51:12.083
We had deals here. Your father-in-law...

51:12.166 --> 51:15.500
Fuck my brother-in-law and all his clique!

51:15.583 --> 51:18.625
Let me tell you, when all this calms down,

51:18.708 --> 51:22.958
they'll come back. Know why?
They need us like we need them.

51:23.041 --> 51:26.416
-Money's all they're interested in.
-Oh, yeah?

51:26.750 --> 51:29.916
Your brother's the devil,
he'll drag us all down.

51:30.000 --> 51:31.375
The thing is, Zak,

51:31.458 --> 51:33.833
we shouldn't have got caught.

51:34.375 --> 51:36.958
-Why not?
-Why were the cops there?

51:38.083 --> 51:39.541
<i>It's gotta stop.</i>

51:39.625 --> 51:40.875
Take a chill pill.

51:40.958 --> 51:43.291
-You're scared of him.
-Hey!

51:43.375 --> 51:47.958
Look, he's my brother!
What can I do, huh? Tell me!

51:48.041 --> 51:50.083
Lucky for him he is.

51:53.500 --> 51:54.916
Watch your mouth.

51:55.583 --> 51:57.000
Someone ratted on us.

51:57.250 --> 51:58.708
Stop talking crap.

52:01.208 --> 52:02.666
The nights I spent...

52:03.916 --> 52:05.250
5,475 nights

52:05.333 --> 52:07.208
going over it in my head...

52:08.916 --> 52:11.666
<i>We were the last to leave, you behind me.</i>

52:11.750 --> 52:13.791
<i>They start shooting.</i>

52:14.250 --> 52:15.833
<i>I see you on the ground.</i>

52:15.916 --> 52:17.083
<i>I go back for you.</i>

52:17.166 --> 52:18.875
<i>Hicham covers us.</i>

52:20.166 --> 52:22.250
<i>Who's there, not moving?</i>

52:22.333 --> 52:25.375
<i>Who takes off</i>
<i>as soon as I put you in the car?</i>

52:25.458 --> 52:26.500
Winny?

52:26.583 --> 52:28.583
No, he came back with Goyave.

52:29.833 --> 52:30.666
Franck?

52:33.583 --> 52:35.000
He was driving.

52:36.833 --> 52:39.458
Since he was the only dealer,

52:39.958 --> 52:41.916
he ratted on us to save his ass.

52:42.208 --> 52:43.250
No way!

52:43.833 --> 52:45.166
Don't say that.

52:45.250 --> 52:47.166
OK, I'll shut up.

52:47.625 --> 52:50.000
-He's my friend.
-We were all friends.

52:50.083 --> 52:51.166
<i>I'm your friend!</i>

52:51.416 --> 52:53.708
I'm here to warn and protect you.

52:53.958 --> 52:56.500
But take a good look around.

52:57.083 --> 52:59.583
We're just waiting like jerks.

52:59.666 --> 53:01.916
In two short weeks,

53:02.000 --> 53:04.791
he's turned our paradise into hell!

53:28.958 --> 53:31.083
-Hello.
<i>-It's done.</i>

53:31.708 --> 53:32.958
Call your brother-in-law.

55:04.125 --> 55:06.666
They can't find us here.

55:07.041 --> 55:08.333
Later.

55:16.500 --> 55:20.041
-Want something?
-No, thanks, I'm not hungry.

55:42.041 --> 55:43.458
Yeah, hello.

55:53.500 --> 55:55.625
Julia, take the kids upstairs.

55:55.708 --> 55:56.958
Go on, kids.

55:59.958 --> 56:01.416
Let's read a story.

56:17.291 --> 56:18.625
So?

56:19.166 --> 56:20.541
What happened?

56:21.125 --> 56:23.083
I didn't see it coming.

56:24.000 --> 56:26.500
Is that all you can say? Is it?

56:28.833 --> 56:31.625
-Where were you?
-I was sleeping.

56:34.458 --> 56:36.666
You were sleeping?

56:36.750 --> 56:40.416
-I'm sorry, bro.
-Sorry? Sorry for what?

56:40.500 --> 56:42.833
-You did nothing.
-What could I do?

56:42.916 --> 56:44.583
What could you do?!

56:44.666 --> 56:48.750
We're at war, you were asleep!
You had my wife and kids!

56:49.166 --> 56:50.708
Get off me!

56:50.791 --> 56:52.750
I fucked up.

56:52.833 --> 56:54.958
You did? Well, fuck you, too!

56:55.041 --> 56:56.000
Stop it.

56:56.083 --> 56:59.791
How did they find us?
I didn't even know the place.

57:00.166 --> 57:03.000
So, go on, hit me. Kill me.

57:03.083 --> 57:04.791
Go on.

57:04.875 --> 57:07.541
I said I was sorry, bro.

57:26.500 --> 57:28.666
There are three dead at Kata Beach.

57:28.750 --> 57:30.208
There were four of them.

57:33.041 --> 57:35.500
So, one fucker is still out there.

58:27.166 --> 58:28.666
<i>Don't take any risks.</i>

58:29.541 --> 58:31.083
Wait till they call.

58:32.541 --> 58:36.125
I'll be there first thing tomorrow
with the two million...

58:36.541 --> 58:38.083
and with men.

1:00:08.541 --> 1:00:11.250
Know what Julius Caesar said...

1:00:11.833 --> 1:00:14.041
about the French?

1:00:14.291 --> 1:00:16.416
They're the best fighters,

1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:18.500
but if you amuse them,

1:00:19.250 --> 1:00:21.166
they're worse than women.

1:00:22.916 --> 1:00:24.208
Why say that to me?

1:00:24.291 --> 1:00:26.666
-I frequent them.
-Take care...

1:00:28.125 --> 1:00:32.000
of those who handle our business,
be they black or white.

1:00:33.125 --> 1:00:34.250
Who was with her?

1:00:36.333 --> 1:00:37.166
I was.

1:00:39.916 --> 1:00:41.208
And Winny.

1:00:44.708 --> 1:00:45.541
What?

1:00:46.583 --> 1:00:49.416
That they'll check everything.

1:00:50.541 --> 1:00:52.958
And he mentioned Julius Caesar.

1:00:53.041 --> 1:00:54.500
He ain't happy.

1:03:01.250 --> 1:03:02.666
Come with us.

1:03:07.541 --> 1:03:09.125
Notice anything?

1:03:09.541 --> 1:03:14.250
I couldn't hear anything. They put
headphones on me with loud music.

1:03:14.625 --> 1:03:18.333
-Thai music?
-No, French rap.

1:03:20.083 --> 1:03:22.625
OK. Let's go.

1:03:35.041 --> 1:03:36.958
Let's forget all this.

1:04:00.708 --> 1:04:01.916
Vinz!

1:04:02.958 --> 1:04:04.916
-You good?
-Yeah, you?

1:04:05.375 --> 1:04:07.541
-OK, bro?
-Well done.

1:04:18.666 --> 1:04:20.541
We'll have a cool vacation!

1:04:46.541 --> 1:04:48.500
You have to go to Bangkok.

1:04:48.583 --> 1:04:51.291
-What about you?
-I need to stay here.

1:04:51.541 --> 1:04:54.500
-Will you stay long?
-While I fix things.

1:04:56.000 --> 1:04:57.583
You take care.

1:06:11.166 --> 1:06:12.125
Your brother?

1:06:13.208 --> 1:06:14.208
What about him?

1:06:14.958 --> 1:06:17.083
Why didn't he attend the ceremony?

1:06:17.458 --> 1:06:18.833
I don't know.

1:06:32.458 --> 1:06:33.625
You see...

1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:37.250
We're the same.

1:06:38.083 --> 1:06:40.208
We have no secrets from each other.

1:07:36.125 --> 1:07:38.125
-Wait.
-What?

1:07:38.208 --> 1:07:40.083
I have a surprise for you.

1:07:40.166 --> 1:07:41.500
What?

1:07:41.583 --> 1:07:42.750
Look.

1:07:43.708 --> 1:07:45.083
Oh, no!

1:07:46.250 --> 1:07:48.083
Oh, my brother!

1:07:49.833 --> 1:07:51.416
Oh, Vinz!

1:07:52.375 --> 1:07:53.708
How are you?

1:07:54.791 --> 1:07:56.083
This is Pablo.

1:07:56.166 --> 1:07:57.625
Hi there.

1:07:57.708 --> 1:07:59.166
Pleased to meet you.

1:07:59.583 --> 1:08:01.791
I didn't know you were coming.

1:08:01.875 --> 1:08:05.291
-I wouldn't miss your wedding.
-He didn't tell me!

1:08:05.375 --> 1:08:07.833
-It's the big day.
-That's life.

1:08:26.541 --> 1:08:27.833
Thank you.

1:08:32.708 --> 1:08:34.000
I'm happy!

1:08:41.875 --> 1:08:43.541
You won't like this.

1:08:45.125 --> 1:08:46.041
Try me.

1:08:47.458 --> 1:08:49.166
You two are going home.

1:08:50.916 --> 1:08:52.958
It's too dangerous here.

1:08:53.291 --> 1:08:56.208
Where will I go?
We're married. Come with me.

1:08:58.833 --> 1:09:01.333
My honeymoon gift is "Beat it"?

1:09:01.666 --> 1:09:03.916
I'll give you money to go.

1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:06.916
It'll soon calm down. I'll come back.

1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:08.208
When is "soon"?

1:09:08.583 --> 1:09:12.625
In one year? Two?
When I visit your grave? It'll be calmer!

1:09:12.708 --> 1:09:14.291
-Look...
-What was it for?

1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:19.041
You know who I am,
what I do, what I think?

1:09:19.125 --> 1:09:21.291
No. You never wanted to know.

1:09:23.166 --> 1:09:27.291
You imagined it was nicer than it was.
So, keep imagining.

1:09:27.375 --> 1:09:29.208
My life is screwed.

1:09:29.458 --> 1:09:31.333
Isn't my life screwed?

1:09:32.208 --> 1:09:33.458
-Stop it.
-Stop what?

1:09:33.541 --> 1:09:34.958
Everything!

1:09:35.041 --> 1:09:37.458
Why are you armed in a restaurant?

1:09:37.833 --> 1:09:40.083
I want you to be free from want.

1:09:40.833 --> 1:09:42.458
Free from want?

1:09:43.041 --> 1:09:45.625
What do I care if you're not there?

1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:49.208
Here.

1:09:51.416 --> 1:09:52.416
What's that?

1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:09.166
-Was the kidnapping you?
-Are you done?

1:10:12.083 --> 1:10:13.416
Yeah, I'm done.

1:10:14.750 --> 1:10:17.833
Know what? If that's all you had to say,

1:10:17.916 --> 1:10:19.708
you needn't have bothered!

1:10:42.375 --> 1:10:43.375
Get in.

1:10:58.333 --> 1:11:01.041
Don't come to the airport tomorrow.

1:11:01.375 --> 1:11:04.125
-If you say so.
-I've had enough goodbyes.

1:11:08.458 --> 1:11:09.875
Please, don't cry.

1:11:09.958 --> 1:11:13.333
I'm not. It's not sorrow, it's anger.

1:11:17.166 --> 1:11:20.791
-I did it all for you.
-You shouldn't have!

1:11:22.333 --> 1:11:25.291
Alone with you in a little place,

1:11:25.375 --> 1:11:28.333
I'd have been happy to lead a normal life.

1:11:31.375 --> 1:11:33.250
Know what "normal" means?

1:11:38.083 --> 1:11:40.791
I wish you'd have died in that holdup.

1:11:42.166 --> 1:11:44.000
I could've started over.

1:11:45.875 --> 1:11:48.875
Don't fuckin' touch me! Don't!

1:11:48.958 --> 1:11:51.083
-Stop it!
-Come here!

1:11:51.166 --> 1:11:53.750
Don't touch me!

1:11:53.833 --> 1:11:55.625
Don't! Fuck off!

1:11:55.708 --> 1:11:59.041
I don't wanna see you again! Fuck off!

1:14:17.583 --> 1:14:18.541
What?

1:14:18.625 --> 1:14:21.375
Did we arrive ten days ago?
Are we siblings?

1:14:26.750 --> 1:14:28.041
On vacation?

1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:33.250
Which hotel?

1:14:48.375 --> 1:14:49.750
Take him away.

1:16:42.875 --> 1:16:43.833
So?

1:16:46.958 --> 1:16:49.375
-Your brother?
-Who asked you? Shut up!

1:16:49.708 --> 1:16:51.041
I'm your friend.

1:16:51.125 --> 1:16:53.541
Screw you! Stop thinking for me!

1:16:53.625 --> 1:16:55.791
Did I ask you to think for me?

1:16:56.458 --> 1:17:00.250
Listen, we're the next on the list.
I won't stand for that.

1:17:02.208 --> 1:17:04.375
We built everything here.

1:17:04.916 --> 1:17:06.166
We're losing it all.

1:17:07.166 --> 1:17:10.000
Did you want for anything before he came?

1:17:12.541 --> 1:17:14.750
There's no point talking to you.

1:17:23.208 --> 1:17:24.458
Hey, bro.

1:17:27.958 --> 1:17:29.625
I wanted us to talk.

1:17:29.708 --> 1:17:30.916
Why?

1:17:32.166 --> 1:17:35.166
It's gone to shit.
We gotta take some decisions.

1:17:35.666 --> 1:17:36.916
What decisions?

1:17:41.458 --> 1:17:42.375
Mehdi...

1:17:45.416 --> 1:17:46.708
Screw your crap.

1:17:47.833 --> 1:17:48.916
Oh, yeah?

1:17:49.000 --> 1:17:49.958
Fuck you.

1:17:50.208 --> 1:17:51.333
OK, great!

1:17:51.583 --> 1:17:55.083
Understand? Count me out. Screw your crap.

1:17:55.166 --> 1:17:57.625
OK, you're doing fine. Stay like that.

1:17:58.125 --> 1:18:00.041
Let's leave this asshole.

1:18:40.833 --> 1:18:42.333
Go for a piss, you.

1:18:45.583 --> 1:18:47.333
What do you think?

1:18:47.416 --> 1:18:49.291
-Not much.
-Oh, yeah?

1:18:49.375 --> 1:18:51.375
We just take it, lying down?

1:18:51.833 --> 1:18:53.833
Is Mehdi your new partner?

1:18:53.916 --> 1:18:55.291
Mehdi's my friend.

1:18:55.750 --> 1:18:57.583
He's our friend, too.

1:18:57.666 --> 1:19:01.458
-You're under his thumb.
-What? You're in Hicham's pants.

1:19:02.000 --> 1:19:03.750
Oh, yeah? That's good.

1:19:03.833 --> 1:19:06.250
Leave me out of it. I hate trouble.

1:19:06.333 --> 1:19:10.083
We've always been this close!
What're we doing here?

1:19:10.166 --> 1:19:11.291
What about you?

1:19:11.375 --> 1:19:13.416
I'm looking out for all of us.

1:19:13.500 --> 1:19:14.500
Sure!

1:19:15.375 --> 1:19:17.333
-Guys, calm down.
-I'm outta here.

1:19:17.625 --> 1:19:20.875
Yeah, get outta here.
But you shouldn't stay neutral.

1:19:21.625 --> 1:19:22.833
You're my friend.

1:19:23.083 --> 1:19:26.208
All we've done counts for zilch
since Mehdi came.

1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:30.375
Got a light?

1:19:34.458 --> 1:19:35.875
Pain in the ass.

1:19:37.500 --> 1:19:40.375
-You shaking?
-What're you talking about?

1:19:40.708 --> 1:19:43.125
You were shaking when you ratted on us!

1:19:44.250 --> 1:19:46.500
-What?
-What?

1:19:46.583 --> 1:19:50.125
Yeah. Unless it was Hicham,
and you're protecting him.

1:19:57.625 --> 1:19:58.666
What...

1:21:20.625 --> 1:21:22.458
I smoked Winny and Zak.

1:21:26.375 --> 1:21:29.958
I understand about Zak.
He was in league with my brother.

1:21:30.041 --> 1:21:31.458
But tell me something.

1:21:33.208 --> 1:21:35.166
-Why Winny?
-It was Zak...

1:21:35.250 --> 1:21:37.000
Mehdi got to him.

1:21:37.083 --> 1:21:40.375
We argued. Winny stuck up for him.
I shot 'em.

1:21:45.041 --> 1:21:47.333
He thought we'd ratted on Mehdi.

1:21:48.875 --> 1:21:49.875
What?

1:21:51.875 --> 1:21:54.833
I may be many things,
but I'm not a dirty rat.

1:21:55.708 --> 1:21:57.708
I'm not one of those fuckers.

1:21:58.791 --> 1:22:00.625
I always protected you.

1:22:01.458 --> 1:22:02.791
They were gonna shoot me.

1:22:04.625 --> 1:22:08.708
It's your brother.
I told you, but you wouldn't listen.

1:22:08.791 --> 1:22:11.250
He turned us against each other.

1:22:12.833 --> 1:22:15.708
All to take over our business.

1:22:15.958 --> 1:22:17.791
What would you have done?

1:22:22.791 --> 1:22:24.541
I'll tell you, golfer boy.

1:22:25.333 --> 1:22:28.750
Do you know the rule of three?
One always gets it.

1:22:31.125 --> 1:22:32.875
You've been too selfish.

1:22:33.916 --> 1:22:36.541
I told you to stop thinking for me.

1:22:37.875 --> 1:22:40.000
You asked what was best for me.

1:22:41.125 --> 1:22:42.833
Well, I'll tell you.

1:22:44.041 --> 1:22:46.041
Protecting my brother, period.

1:22:46.958 --> 1:22:48.291
Yeah...

1:22:55.875 --> 1:22:57.250
Look at me, Mehdi.

1:22:57.791 --> 1:22:59.250
I didn't rat on you.

1:23:00.541 --> 1:23:03.750
You believed Zak? You're a fool.

1:23:04.416 --> 1:23:06.250
You killed two innocent men.

1:23:06.583 --> 1:23:08.458
No-one ratted on anyone.

1:23:09.291 --> 1:23:11.375
I was followed by the cops.

1:23:13.166 --> 1:23:14.416
So, you killed them.

1:23:15.791 --> 1:23:16.958
Right?

1:23:19.041 --> 1:23:20.208
Fuckin' stop it.

1:23:20.291 --> 1:23:21.333
Stop what?

1:23:21.708 --> 1:23:23.833
While you were sunbathing

1:23:23.916 --> 1:23:27.916
on your yacht, playing golf,
and getting sucked by ladyboys,

1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:29.625
I was reading books.

1:23:30.541 --> 1:23:32.083
I read Machiavelli.

1:23:32.458 --> 1:23:33.958
He said

1:23:34.250 --> 1:23:38.708
men forget their father's death sooner
than the loss of their inheritance.

1:23:40.541 --> 1:23:43.291
You see... How did you put it? Oh, yeah.

1:23:43.625 --> 1:23:46.458
"The solar plexus is

1:23:46.541 --> 1:23:47.791
in tune."

1:23:50.583 --> 1:23:52.125
Why, Hicham?

1:23:58.208 --> 1:24:00.500
So, you wanted to kill my brother?

1:24:02.791 --> 1:24:04.500
Kill my brother?

1:24:04.791 --> 1:24:06.541
You motherfucker!

1:24:07.041 --> 1:24:08.958
Son of a fuckin' bitch!

1:24:14.458 --> 1:24:15.916
Songchai, Goyave!

1:24:32.375 --> 1:24:35.583
What? This fucker killed Winny and Zak.

1:24:38.750 --> 1:24:40.416
Get rid of this shit.

1:25:46.333 --> 1:25:49.166
Aom, I have some bad news.

1:25:49.833 --> 1:25:51.375
<i>Is it my husband?</i>

1:25:51.875 --> 1:25:53.375
I'll tell you later.

1:27:21.166 --> 1:27:23.625
It's done. It's over.

1:27:35.791 --> 1:27:37.750
Go play over there, boys.
