00:17.060 --> 00:19.760
Look at her.
We blinkedand 4 years went by.

00:19.760 --> 00:22.010
So,what do you think?
Should we do this again?

00:22.020 --> 00:23.880
Sounds like a plan.

00:23.890 --> 00:26.500
Uh-oh.
Who's coming?Aah!

00:28.260 --> 00:30.460

00:54.460 --> 00:57.030
My daughter molly.
She's 6.

00:57.030 --> 00:59.460
She's got braids,yellow sweatshirt.

00:59.480 --> 01:01.400
- What am I gonna do?
- Ok,ok.Calm down.

01:01.430 --> 01:02.300
Braids,yellow sweatshirt.

01:02.340 --> 01:05.630
We were playing hideand seek up here.
She must have gotten lost in the trees.

01:05.680 --> 01:07.300
Oh,god.
I'm so stupid.

01:07.330 --> 01:09.480
Tom!
Tom!

01:09.480 --> 01:11.490
Shh,shh,shh!
Wait.

01:11.510 --> 01:14.110
Did you hear that?
It came from over here.

01:14.140 --> 01:17.230
Molly?
Honey?!

01:17.260 --> 01:19.240
Daddy's here.

01:21.830 --> 01:24.250
Molly.

01:24.280 --> 01:26.510
No.

01:28.840 --> 01:33.520
Did you find molly?
Is she ok?

01:44.900 --> 01:49.930
Mommy,wake up.
It's past 10:00.

01:52.530 --> 01:57.600
Ah!Damn it.
Why did you let me sleep?

01:57.650 --> 02:00.090
Why don't you getan alarm clock?

02:00.100 --> 02:02.510
- Did you eat?
- Pizza.

02:02.560 --> 02:05.460
- And the baby?
- Pizza.And milk.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.220
Get some sleep,jay.

02:20.940 --> 02:24.060
Hey,I'll bring yousome pancakes.

02:25.660 --> 02:28.160
Yeah.
When?

02:37.100 --> 02:40.040
Hi.
Want company?

02:50.040 --> 02:51.970

03:15.110 --> 03:16.880

- Yes.

03:16.890 --> 03:19.880
I'm agentemily prentiss.

03:19.920 --> 03:23.580
How do you do?
Oh,you're ambassadorprentiss' daughter.

03:23.620 --> 03:26.010
I did security clearances
for your mother's staff.

03:26.020 --> 03:27.970
It was oneof my first commands.

03:28.010 --> 03:30.970
I believe you were off
to brown at the time.

03:31.010 --> 03:32.960
- Actually,it was yale.
- Ah.

03:32.980 --> 03:35.380
I've been in the bureau almost 10 years now.

03:35.380 --> 03:37.130
Don't tell me that.
Has it been that long?

03:37.160 --> 03:41.190
Apparently,sir.But I work mostly
in the midwest.St.Louis,chicago.

03:41.210 --> 03:42.690
Good.

03:43.120 --> 03:46.300
- Your parents well?
- Yeah,yeah,they're great.

03:46.300 --> 03:47.680
Excellent.

03:50.260 --> 03:51.540
What can I do for you?

03:51.560 --> 03:55.490
Uh,well,I guessI was hoping
you could tell mewhere to put my stuff.

03:55.500 --> 03:56.550
I'm sorry?

03:56.580 --> 04:01.890
I'm supposed to starthere today...
at the bau.

04:02.750 --> 04:04.670
There's been a mistake.

04:05.290 --> 04:07.870
- I don't think so,sir.
- There's definitelybeen a mistake.

04:07.880 --> 04:10.170
Excuse me.
We'regetting started.

04:10.200 --> 04:12.340
Thank you.
I'll be right there.

04:12.340 --> 04:14.930
I didn't approve
this transfer,agent prentiss.

04:14.930 --> 04:17.490
I'm sorry for the confusion,
but you've been misinformed.

04:17.519 --> 04:20.440
But--excuse me.
It's very goodto see you again.

04:26.750 --> 04:29.300
did you approveany transfer?

04:30.410 --> 04:32.320
No.
I would'vediscussed it.

04:32.350 --> 04:35.580
That's what I thought.
She's got the paperworkto join the team.

04:35.620 --> 04:38.530
- You want meto make a call?
- No.I'll make it.

04:43.190 --> 04:45.370
St.Louis is in trouble.

04:45.370 --> 04:47.660
They've got 2 serial killers.

04:48.740 --> 04:52.450
This killer abducts his victims
from public places,dumps them in the woods.

04:52.450 --> 04:55.530
They consulted us months ago
after the third murder.

04:55.550 --> 04:58.060
Well,now it might beup to 6.

04:59.320 --> 05:01.490
Ellen carroll's been missing
since yesterday.

05:01.510 --> 05:05.690
The first 2 victimswere found near
mill creekin mark twainnational forest.

05:05.700 --> 05:07.420
No wonder it takes daysto find the bodies.

05:07.450 --> 05:11.780
The forestis 1.5 million acres
and 78,000of that is wilderness.

05:11.850 --> 05:13.290
What's the storywith these women?

05:13.300 --> 05:17.030
8 victims. All prostitutes.
Latest is marci mitchell.

05:17.030 --> 05:19.210
She was killed last night
with a .44 magnum.

05:19.220 --> 05:22.750
All are tiedto a serial shooter
claiming responsibility.

05:22.770 --> 05:26.350
He's contactedjim meyers,
a reporterat the missouri herald.

05:26.380 --> 05:28.990
So he's not getting
the attention he thinkshe deserves.

05:29.020 --> 05:31.830
He signs itthe hollow man,
names himself for the press.

05:31.840 --> 05:34.850
Why hollow man?
What,he feel emptyinside or something?

05:34.870 --> 05:36.640
He uses hollow pointbullets.

05:36.660 --> 05:39.230
No one even knewthis guy existed
until he sentthis letter.

05:39.260 --> 05:42.570
Well,he's killedmore victims,
but lookwho he's chosen.

05:42.580 --> 05:47.180
Hundreds of victimsgo unnoticed because
they'resocial outcastsand never makethe front page.

05:47.180 --> 05:50.260
When mill creek kills,the hollow man
shoots another prostitute.

05:50.270 --> 05:52.470
So one doesn't want to be
outdone by the other.

05:52.490 --> 05:54.370
Sounds likesibling rivalry to me.

05:54.390 --> 05:56.650
They've been killing
independently of eachother for a year now.

05:56.670 --> 05:59.800
Each kill they'relearning something...

05:59.860 --> 06:02.280
from the other.

06:03.950 --> 06:06.240

Elbert hubbert once wrote,"if men could only know each other,they would neitheridolize nor hate."

06:48.460 --> 06:49.950
Thank you.

06:58.890 --> 07:00.180
What's wrong?

07:00.200 --> 07:03.740
Did you know there areroughly 30 serial killers
at large in the U.S.At any given time?

07:03.780 --> 07:07.470
It's an incredibly rare occurrence
to have themoperating in the same city.

07:07.480 --> 07:10.540
- How many timeshas that happened?
- To my knowledge,3 times.

07:10.590 --> 07:13.300
There was a guy killing
at the same time as the son of sam.

07:13.300 --> 07:16.490
And then againin new orleans,
and most recentlywith the phoenix murders.

07:16.510 --> 07:18.270
Serial shootersare typically loners.

07:18.290 --> 07:19.860
This guy likesto kill at night.

07:19.870 --> 07:24.080
His victimsare prostitutes,so he may lack confidence
with womenor have poorsocial skills.

07:24.080 --> 07:26.660
No rape.
The guycould be impotent.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.300
He's a wannabetough guy.

07:28.310 --> 07:30.460
It's not hard to be  tough holding a .44.

07:30.510 --> 07:33.440
The gun gives him power and
lets him maintaindistance from the kill.

07:33.450 --> 07:35.780
This guy doesn'twant to touch
the bodieswith his hands.

07:35.790 --> 07:38.100
Mill creek killer.

07:38.110 --> 07:43.110
Hunts during the day, targets
educated,middle-class women.

07:43.140 --> 07:45.270
He'd have to lookand act like they do.

07:45.290 --> 07:48.070
The women die from blunt force head traumas.

07:48.090 --> 07:52.770
This guy wantsto be close,
he wants to feel the lifeleave their bodies.

07:52.780 --> 07:54.720
These guysare polar opposites.

07:54.720 --> 07:58.230
Just like their victims.They live in
the samecity but they'reworlds apart.

07:58.240 --> 08:01.510
I'm gonna see ifthe shooter's victims
have any familiesI can talk to.

08:01.510 --> 08:03.940
That's a good idea.I'm already familiar
with the mill creek case.

08:03.940 --> 08:08.160
Reid,can you takea look at the letter
for handwriting analysisand psycho linguistics?

08:08.170 --> 08:10.410
- Of course.
- Looks like I'm with you.

08:10.430 --> 08:12.400
I'll go aheadand talk with
ellencarroll's husband.

08:12.420 --> 08:14.920
I'm meeting jim meyers,
the reporterfrom the missouri herald.

08:14.930 --> 08:16.900
Well,tell him not to write about the hollow man.

08:16.920 --> 08:22.740
If we want to drawthe shooter out,
best way to do that isto act like he doesn't exist.

08:24.070 --> 08:27.220
I'd feel much betterwhen you find ellen.

08:27.650 --> 08:30.240
Mr. Carroll,believe me,we are trying.

08:31.480 --> 08:37.870
You know,when you have kids,you become so fixated
on where they areand what they're doing,

08:37.880 --> 08:40.710
you don't thinkyou need  to worryabout your spouse.

08:41.210 --> 08:44.070
I understandyour wife is
a partnerat a law firm.

08:44.070 --> 08:48.240
Now aside from work,taking care of the family,
does she make timefor herself?

08:48.280 --> 08:52.460
She's an avid runner,participates in the
st.Louis marathonevery year.

08:52.470 --> 08:55.090
Is she shy,nervous about meeting new people?

08:55.100 --> 08:57.520
Ever since we had katie, I'd say
she'smuch more trusting.

08:57.540 --> 09:00.840
You don't rememberher talking to anyone
you don't knowat that playground?

09:00.870 --> 09:04.230
No.
No one.

09:04.250 --> 09:06.730
How did I not seesomeone take my wife?

09:06.740 --> 09:11.310
Mr. Carroll,the man who did this,
somehow he justfits right in.

09:11.330 --> 09:14.380
He doesn't look or sound like
he doesn't belong.

09:15.230 --> 09:18.050
Oh,hey,little lady.

09:19.840 --> 09:21.550
Hey.

09:25.560 --> 09:30.110
She keeps asking me, when her
mommy'scoming home.

09:36.160 --> 09:39.380
I don't knowwhat to saY.

10:12.140 --> 10:14.660
I missed you.

10:47.800 --> 10:50.460
You are so beautiful.

11:05.190 --> 11:07.510
Agents hotchnerand reid,fbi.

11:07.530 --> 11:10.680
- What do you want?
- We'd like to talk to you.

11:10.710 --> 11:13.280
Hold thatbadge up again.

11:24.640 --> 11:26.930
We're here to talk to you
about marcie mitchell.

11:26.930 --> 11:30.270
- I'm her mother.
- I'm sorryfor your loss,ma'am.

11:30.270 --> 11:31.500
What's this?

11:31.500 --> 11:33.940
They're for me.
Take your brother inside.

11:33.960 --> 11:37.280
- Is this about mom?
- I said inside.

11:49.630 --> 11:52.470
You gonna judge meor ask questions?

11:52.510 --> 11:54.510
Is there anyone who can
help youwith the kids?

11:54.510 --> 11:56.250
Is that whatyou came here for?

11:56.260 --> 11:58.640
Ma'am,we'vejust been assigned your daughter's case.

11:58.640 --> 12:02.420
We're in the processof gathering information,
but so far no witnesseshave come forward.

12:02.430 --> 12:06.430
Well,around here guns go off
like those damn car alarms--every 15 minutes.

12:06.450 --> 12:08.720
Nobody'sstupid enough to talk, nobody cares.

12:08.750 --> 12:10.440
We do.

12:10.450 --> 12:13.470
You wouldn't even behere if
it wasn't for them.

12:14.080 --> 12:19.380
"Heinous crimes against
upstanding membersof the community."

12:19.400 --> 12:22.260
Nobody writes about
prostitutes being shot

12:22.300 --> 12:24.480
because they won'tadmit they think
they'recleaning up the place.

12:24.500 --> 12:25.990
You're right.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.950
Caseslike your daughter's
usually go unsolved.

12:27.960 --> 12:31.490
The problem is peoplearen't looking for them
because they don't knowthat they're missing.

12:31.510 --> 12:35.690
Part of her job was to
stay below the radar.

12:36.320 --> 12:39.170
Doesn't mean she wasany less important.

12:40.340 --> 12:43.240
She made bad choices.

12:43.260 --> 12:45.710
But she was a good person.

12:47.020 --> 12:49.250
She loved those boys.

12:51.010 --> 12:52.870
Whoever shot her should
pay for what they did.

12:52.870 --> 12:54.460
So don't come in here
and say you're sorry.

12:54.480 --> 12:56.630
Just dosomething about it.

12:57.650 --> 12:59.390
We will,Ma'am.

13:03.010 --> 13:04.620
Hi.
You must beagent sheridan?

13:04.640 --> 13:05.850
- Agent jareau.
- Hi.

13:05.860 --> 13:08.000
- Really appreciateyou coming so quickly.
- Yeah.

13:08.050 --> 13:10.240
Why don't youset up in here?

13:10.250 --> 13:13.760
Oh,wow.You've gotlots of evidence
for the mill creekkiller case.

13:13.780 --> 13:17.050
- What aboutthe hollow man?
- Right here.

13:18.740 --> 13:22.560
There's beenat least 8 women shot.
This is all we've got?

13:22.580 --> 13:25.410
You know thesecases
don't generate much evidence.

13:25.420 --> 13:30.180
All we have at the scene are
a couple of bulletsand no one's talking.

13:30.180 --> 13:31.310
Well,hopefully,we can change that.

13:31.360 --> 13:33.900
Agent jareau,there's
a reporter here to see you.

13:33.910 --> 13:36.800
- Thank you.Excuse me.
- Sure.

13:39.020 --> 13:42.310
Jim meyers.Hi.Agent jareau.
We spoke on the phone.

13:42.330 --> 13:43.690
Hi.
Thanks for stopping by.

13:43.710 --> 13:46.170
Sure.
Here's thatletter I faxed to you.

13:46.190 --> 13:47.400
Oh,great.

13:47.420 --> 13:51.810
So,did the hollow manshoot those prostitutes
because I wrote aboutthe mill creek victims?

13:51.820 --> 13:54.050
He would've killedthem anyway.

13:54.060 --> 13:57.410
But right now he'slooking for recognition.
That's whyhe's contacted you.

13:57.430 --> 13:58.710
But I'm not in any danger.

13:58.740 --> 14:01.590
I mean,I don't wantto be
staring downthe barrel of a gun.

14:01.600 --> 14:05.160
Right now he needs you.You're his
only hope toget on that front page.

14:05.200 --> 14:08.960
You know,I had no ideaI could get on
a serial killer's radarby writing aboutanother one.

14:08.980 --> 14:14.350
We're going to ask thatyou not print anything relatingto the hollow man orthe women he's killed.

14:14.380 --> 14:17.660
Don't those victimsdeserve just
as much inkas those other women?

14:17.720 --> 14:19.100
Of course they do.

14:19.120 --> 14:21.950
But we needthe shooter
to keep communicatingwith you.

14:21.960 --> 14:25.070
And if you satisfyhis need for attention,
he could disappear,and I'm sorry.

14:25.100 --> 14:27.140
We just can't takethat chance.

14:27.150 --> 14:29.420
Excuse me,agent jareau?

14:32.840 --> 14:36.110
We just found ellencarroll's body.

14:39.130 --> 14:42.870
Agents gideon,morgan,this is agent sheridan.

14:42.880 --> 14:45.430
- How are you?
- Forgive me.

14:45.430 --> 14:48.390
How faris the abduction
itefrom these woods?

14:48.390 --> 14:50.850
About 40 miles or so.

14:50.890 --> 14:54.730
He tried to hide itpretty well.
He covers the bodyvery carefully.

14:54.750 --> 14:56.910
Must feel remorsefor killing them.

14:56.930 --> 15:00.940
This lipstick's beenapplied recently.
It's still moist.

15:00.940 --> 15:03.980
Look at her hair.
It's been brushed,put behind her ears.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.620
She was abducted,what,an hour from here?
Draggedthrough these woods?

15:07.640 --> 15:09.260
Her hair would notlook like that.

15:09.270 --> 15:12.630
So he keeps her safefrom the elements
and then comes backfor the body.

15:12.650 --> 15:15.170
That's why he chooses a
secondary locationthat's so remote.

15:15.180 --> 15:17.900
- This isn'tabout remorse.
- No.

15:17.920 --> 15:20.580
- He wantsto be alone with her.
- Needs his privacy.

15:20.610 --> 15:22.450
You never noticed
the hair or the makeupbefore?

15:22.460 --> 15:24.690
No.
Maybe it wasthe timing.

15:24.700 --> 15:29.530
She was foundwithin 24 hours,and the others
had alreadysuccumbed to the elements.

15:29.570 --> 15:31.770
Sex actswith dead bodies are rare occurrences.

15:31.810 --> 15:33.530
However,bundy did it regularly.

15:33.540 --> 15:35.890
So how is thisgoing to help usto catch him?

15:35.900 --> 15:39.780
Now we knowhe has a ritual.
He needs to defilethe bodies.

15:39.810 --> 15:42.890
Next timewe'll be herewaiting for him.

15:44.700 --> 15:47.510
Sixth Victim Falls to Mill Creek Killer

16:12.010 --> 16:14.480
We're off-duty just like you.

16:42.520 --> 16:44.840
2 victims at once.
That's a first for him.

16:44.870 --> 16:48.170
You think he wentout looking to kill more
than one woman,or is it just happenstance?

16:48.170 --> 16:49.960
He chose a differenthunting ground.

16:50.010 --> 16:53.750
Yes,we're in an alley,but we're behind
an expensive hotelin a nice neighborhood.

16:53.760 --> 16:57.220
You get a differentclass of prostitute,
ones that don't walkthe street alone.

16:57.240 --> 16:58.650
He was lookingfor a challenge.

16:58.670 --> 17:02.780
Question is,what gavehim the confidence
to stray outof his comfort zone?

17:02.820 --> 17:04.280
Make sure to runthat for prints.

17:04.319 --> 17:06.430
He displayed the newspaperbetween them.

17:06.460 --> 17:08.859
He took the time when he
could've just tossed it aside.

17:08.880 --> 17:10.660
It's deliberatE.
He wants us to knowhe's angry.

17:10.670 --> 17:13.349
Angry enoughto change his M.O.

17:13.359 --> 17:15.640
I heard there was a double
homicide this morning.

17:15.650 --> 17:16.890
Was it hollow man?

17:16.900 --> 17:19.430
- Agents are confirmingthat now.
- I've written about him.

17:19.460 --> 17:24.460
There's no guaranteethat he would've stopped
killingif you would've giveninto his demands.

17:24.480 --> 17:26.980
In fact,media attention
could've fueled himto kill more.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.130
We don't knowthat for sure.

17:28.150 --> 17:29.850
This is all justa guessing game,isn't it?

17:29.900 --> 17:32.950
No.
It's behavioralanalysis.

17:32.970 --> 17:37.590
We're dealingwith an offenderwho believes
that murdering peopleis a good wayto become famous.

17:37.600 --> 17:40.490
All I know is thatyou told me to
ignore himand he takes 2 lives.

17:40.500 --> 17:43.260
If I dismissthis double homicide,
what happens tomorrow?

17:43.260 --> 17:45.450
We won't knowuntil then.

17:50.770 --> 17:54.120
Too bad we couldn'ttrace
any printsfrom the newspaper.

17:54.130 --> 17:55.660
What have you got?

17:56.280 --> 17:57.850
he only sent thisto an individual,

17:57.870 --> 18:02.060
which shows he'snot confident enough
to initiate contactwith the masses.

18:02.100 --> 18:04.970
Emotional indicators are analyzed through slants.

18:04.980 --> 18:09.300
The shootermaintains vertical,
narrow-lettered writing,both signs of repression.

18:10.400 --> 18:14.290
And the pressure,if you look closely, is excessively heavy,

18:14.340 --> 18:16.770
which showsthat he's uptight and caneasily overreact.

18:16.790 --> 18:18.170
You got all thatfrom his handwriting?

18:18.190 --> 18:21.650
Graphology is an effectiveand reliable
indicatorof personality and behavior.

18:21.660 --> 18:22.880
My writing'salways different.

18:22.890 --> 18:24.930
That's because itexpresses
your emotionsat that given time,

18:24.930 --> 18:28.540
just likeyour facial expressionsparallel
the wayyou're feeling whileyou're speaking.

18:28.560 --> 18:30.390
I'm surprised this guywrites in cursive.

18:30.420 --> 18:33.710
His message is so clear.
I would've thoughthe'd print everything.

18:33.720 --> 18:38.250
Actually,his connectedwriting shows that he deals
with problemsin a practicaland direct manner.

18:38.270 --> 18:41.020
- Like shooting someone.
- Exactly.

18:41.040 --> 18:44.170
The hollow manuses simple statements, all first person.

18:44.190 --> 18:46.140
For example,"I won't be ignored."

18:46.180 --> 18:48.080
He's obviously tiredof feeling this way.

18:48.080 --> 18:52.940
It's quite possible he'sgot a job in solitude
or one that he feelsstrips him of his identity.

18:52.960 --> 18:57.790
His job might require himto wear a uniform,
something that showsabsolutely no individuality.

18:57.840 --> 19:00.050
Or he may be overqualified for his menial job

19:00.080 --> 19:02.940
and feels that he doesn't get
the respectthat he necessarilydeserves.

19:02.940 --> 19:07.020
But todayhe's killed 2 women,
which tells ushe's growing confident.

19:07.030 --> 19:09.230
This makes himunpredictable and dangerous.

19:09.270 --> 19:12.090
And because he hasno physical
contactwith his victims,

19:12.130 --> 19:13.930
it's going to make himthat
much harder to catch.

19:13.950 --> 19:15.730
We have more informationon the mill creek killer

19:15.760 --> 19:20.210
because he spendsa lot of timewith
his victimsbefore and afterhis kills.

19:20.220 --> 19:25.550
Because his victimswillingly follow him
in broad daylight,he appears harmless.

19:25.550 --> 19:27.360
- He's mostlikely handsome.
- Handsome?

19:27.390 --> 19:31.070
Yes.These women wouldn't follow
an unattractive man.They just wouldn'T.

19:31.090 --> 19:33.660
He's handsome,and he's got
the socialskills to trick his victims.

19:33.670 --> 19:36.890
Those who know him well,they'd be shocked
to learn that he'sthe man that we're after.

19:36.900 --> 19:39.330
He's been ableto get his victims
awayfrom family,friends.

19:39.340 --> 19:41.250
Obviously,this makeshim feel powerful.

19:41.260 --> 19:46.190
If this guy is so smart,why would he risk driving
his victimsfrom the abduction siteto the woods?

19:46.220 --> 19:48.180
Because of the ritual.

19:48.180 --> 19:50.440
It's become the mostimportant thing to him.

19:50.450 --> 19:54.160
Dominates his thoughts.
Bullets providethe privacy he needs.

19:54.200 --> 19:56.660
The hollow manis motivated
byexternal pressures.

19:56.700 --> 19:59.380
This is a guy who simplywants attention.

19:59.400 --> 20:02.970
The mill creek killer,on the other hand,
he's drivenby internal forces.

20:02.980 --> 20:04.700
He's a sexuallymotivated offender.

20:04.710 --> 20:06.130
Now,this makes hima lot more predictable

20:06.150 --> 20:09.670
but don't think for a second
it makes himany easier to catch.

20:22.760 --> 20:25.000
Where are you?

20:27.100 --> 20:28.780
Excuse mE.

20:31.720 --> 20:33.720
Meredith dale.
25.

20:33.750 --> 20:36.490
She was supposedto meet her friend
for a bike ridebut disappeared.

20:36.510 --> 20:39.040
- Disappeared when?
- An hour ago.

20:39.070 --> 20:41.280
- How can we be sureit's him?
- Well,look at her.

20:41.330 --> 20:43.780
She's his type physically,
she vanishes into thin air.

20:43.780 --> 20:45.870
It's got the mill creek'sM.O.All over it.

20:45.910 --> 20:48.590
I'll set up road blocks in and out of the forest.

20:48.590 --> 20:52.370
Well,based onthe other timelines,
we have to assume he's hidingher body right now.

20:52.390 --> 20:56.380
Best chanceof catching himis find
meredith dale's bodyand sit tight.

20:56.390 --> 20:58.710
We know he'll be back.

21:06.170 --> 21:08.750
I'm going to need you to step out of your vehicle.

21:08.770 --> 21:11.790
- What's going onhere,officer?
- Just routine check.

21:11.840 --> 21:15.820
- Can you open your back?
- Uh,yeah,sure.

21:18.920 --> 21:21.270
Many people come throughhere today?

21:31.250 --> 21:33.950
- What are youdoing up here?
- Went for a hike.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.490
No water,no supplies?

21:36.520 --> 21:39.200
My bootsare all I need.

21:40.680 --> 21:42.360
That it?

21:42.370 --> 21:44.460
- That's it.
- Ok.

21:44.490 --> 21:47.820
What if these dumpsitesaren't random?

21:47.870 --> 21:49.880
The bodies werescattered all over.

21:49.900 --> 21:52.180
Look at this.
There's no pattern.

21:52.230 --> 21:55.510
No,I see that,but we're talking
about a lotof area to cover here.

21:55.520 --> 21:57.310
He had to havesome kind of
plan going into these woods.

21:57.320 --> 21:58.790
Must have done his homework.

21:58.800 --> 22:01.470
Ok.The first bodywas found
deep into the woods.

22:01.500 --> 22:03.710
That's a 3-hour carride from the city.

22:03.750 --> 22:07.470
The first time,he's more
carefulin disposing of her.

22:07.480 --> 22:11.900
Her body was discovered by a
forest ranger5 daysafter the abduction.

22:11.940 --> 22:17.080
And all the other victims--look at this¡ª
they followthe same pattern.

22:17.100 --> 22:19.930
What are you saying?
You think he worksup there?

22:19.950 --> 22:20.980
He might.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.720
All I doknow for sureis that he has
to be familiar enoughwith these woods

22:23.740 --> 22:25.340
to know when a rangeris on duty.

22:25.350 --> 22:27.710
He knew preciselywhen and where
to drop the bodies.

22:27.720 --> 22:30.830
Now that is an awesome
place to dump a person.

22:30.850 --> 22:34.120
- Come on,garcia.
- What?I'm justsaying,angel fish.

22:34.140 --> 22:38.670
A million acresconverts into
over 2,300square miles to cover.

22:38.680 --> 22:40.230
Evil knewwhat he was doing.

22:40.230 --> 22:43.040
Yeah?Well,now so do we.

22:43.080 --> 22:44.600
Talk to me.
How's the rangerschedule break down?

22:44.620 --> 22:48.060
Ok.The national forestis divided
into 6 ranger districts,

22:48.080 --> 22:49.860
which are patrolledevery 3 to 5 days.

22:49.870 --> 22:53.750
Now,the potosi-fredricktown area
must be where he'sheaded to next

22:53.770 --> 22:55.750
because the rangers werejust there yesterday,

22:55.760 --> 23:00.200
which means they're notscheduled
to revisit itfor at leastanother 3 days.

23:00.210 --> 23:03.870
And look at that,
it's the district closest to the city.

23:03.890 --> 23:06.090
Well,that makes sense.
He's in a hurry.

23:06.110 --> 23:08.310
He wantsto get in and out of there
without a lot of trouble.

23:08.340 --> 23:10.310
Which area has the easiest
access to the main road?

23:10.330 --> 23:13.300
That would be...
saltgrass cove.

23:13.360 --> 23:14.950
Saltgrass cove.

23:16.190 --> 23:19.310
Yep.He'd have plentyof time to revisit her.

23:19.330 --> 23:23.050
What?No,no.I don't want to know that.Bye-bye.

23:23.690 --> 23:26.490
Think I know where he took meredith dale.

23:37.220 --> 23:39.230
Brownie,come here.

23:44.240 --> 23:45.580
Damn it.

23:47.080 --> 23:49.010
Please,please.

23:51.450 --> 23:54.900
Everything needsto look
the sameas when he left it.

23:54.940 --> 23:57.960
- He'll come back.
- He needs to seemeredith again.

23:57.990 --> 24:01.240
This bastard has killed
7 women on my watch.

24:01.260 --> 24:04.980
- Comb the scene!
- Oh,no.Please,please!Stop!

24:05.860 --> 24:07.600
Let's clearthe immediate area.

24:07.680 --> 24:12.630
Post yourselvesalong the perimeter.
It's imperativethat you become invisible.

24:16.230 --> 24:17.940
He set his own trap.

24:17.950 --> 24:21.550
What we need to do now
is stake out in the woodsand hunt him,

24:21.550 --> 24:24.460
just like he doeshis victims.

24:35.190 --> 24:37.070
That's got to be him.

24:55.300 --> 24:58.140
Fbi!Stay down!
Hands whereI can see them.

24:58.160 --> 25:00.600
Ok,ok.
Just take it easy.

25:04.140 --> 25:06.590
Jim meyers.
What the hell?

25:06.610 --> 25:08.900
- You'rethe mill creek killer?
- What?No.

25:08.920 --> 25:10.340
Then how the helldid you get here?

25:10.360 --> 25:12.290
I got another letter from the hollow man.

25:12.320 --> 25:14.300
Telling you exactly where to findmeredith dale?

25:14.300 --> 25:16.660
I swear.
You can read it.

25:25.560 --> 25:27.700
"Follow the cottonwood trail
throughsaltgrass cove."

25:27.720 --> 25:30.560
Wait a minute.
We just figuredthis out ourselves.

25:30.580 --> 25:35.720
How can another killerknow
the specificsabout someone else'sdumpsite?

25:38.410 --> 25:39.750
What's going on?

25:39.800 --> 25:41.990
It's going to beall over the news.

25:42.490 --> 25:45.740
Looklikethe hollow man
didn't give youthe exclusive this time.

25:47.250 --> 25:50.880
So our plan to catchthe mill creek killer
was ruinedby the hollow man?

25:50.880 --> 25:52.570
And now the hollow man'son a high.

25:52.590 --> 25:55.310
He hasn't pulledthe trigger
since he took2 victims yesterday.

25:55.350 --> 25:57.730
Is he satisfied or
is he just getting started?

25:57.740 --> 25:59.270
We'll find out.

25:59.880 --> 26:03.050
"Hollow man helps fbifind
the mill creekkiller's victim."

26:03.070 --> 26:06.320
Nice.He's alerted the media and injected
himselfinto the investigation.

26:06.350 --> 26:08.160
He's getting the attentionhe's been craving.

26:08.190 --> 26:10.450
But if the shooterreally wants
to getthe other guy arrested,

26:10.470 --> 26:12.360
he would've called usand not the media.

26:12.360 --> 26:15.200
He must knowthe mill creek killer
needsto revisit the body.

26:15.220 --> 26:19.610
If he can't defilethe woman again,the need'll
become so strong,it could pushhim into a frenzy.

26:19.630 --> 26:22.820
And if that happens,this guy is just
a time bombwaiting to explode.

26:30.430 --> 26:31.480
Excuse me.

26:32.840 --> 26:35.180
Hi.
Look,I'm having a day.

26:35.230 --> 26:37.980
My car won't startand I forgot my phone.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.030
Could I use yoursto make a call?

26:40.040 --> 26:40.880
Yeah.
Ok.I know it's here.
I just used it.

26:44.800 --> 26:47.690
What,you know what?
Forget the phone.

26:47.710 --> 26:49.660
Maybe it'll start for you.

26:50.700 --> 26:52.950
Walk with me.
It's rightaround the corner.

26:52.970 --> 26:55.220
- No,that's ok.
- No,come on.

26:55.240 --> 26:56.920
No.
No!

26:56.960 --> 26:58.510
- Walk with me.
- Let go of me!

26:58.530 --> 26:59.780
- Now!
- Let me go!

26:59.780 --> 27:01.200
Help!
Help!

27:03.340 --> 27:07.500
Somebody!
Somebody!Help,please!

27:07.540 --> 27:10.240
Somebody!
Please!

27:10.300 --> 27:13.430
- At first he seemedso normal.
- Was he handsome?

27:13.910 --> 27:16.860
- Excuse me?
- Was he handsome?

27:16.910 --> 27:19.770
Yeah.
He was.

27:19.800 --> 27:22.300
Actually,that'swhy I stopped.

27:22.340 --> 27:23.890
When didhis demeanor change?

27:23.900 --> 27:25.800
After I refusedto go to his car.

27:25.830 --> 27:28.950
He grabbedmy arm so hard
I thought thatit would break.

27:28.970 --> 27:33.920
I've been watching the newsabout all these women
being abducted,and I just started screaming.

27:33.920 --> 27:35.560
You trustedyour instincts.

27:35.600 --> 27:37.890
Because of that,you're still alive.

27:37.910 --> 27:40.640
Miss,there's a sketch artist here with us.

27:40.670 --> 27:43.810
He can create a prettyaccurate rendition
from your descriptionof this man.

27:43.830 --> 27:46.520
- Would you sit with him?
- Absolutely.

27:46.530 --> 27:47.950
officer.

27:48.940 --> 27:51.230
- I'm glad you're all right.
- Thank you.

27:53.380 --> 27:55.610
Well,he's becoming
irrational and violentin public.

27:55.630 --> 27:57.500
That's exactlywhat the hollow man
wanted him to do.

27:57.520 --> 28:01.010
Well,if he doesn'tfind a victim soon,
he'll becomemore dangerous.

28:01.030 --> 28:02.620
How's that possible?

28:02.630 --> 28:05.790
He'll dropthe ruse entirely and just
startgrabbing women at random.

28:10.820 --> 28:12.790
Great.
Thanks,man.

28:13.540 --> 28:15.760
The witness gota good look  
at themill creek killer.

28:15.780 --> 28:18.710
You know,if it'sthe hollow man's
intentionto force himinto a frenzy,

28:18.750 --> 28:20.430
he's getting what he wants.

28:20.480 --> 28:22.710
He knew exactly where to
find meredith dale's body.

28:22.730 --> 28:26.000
He figured out the route
to the dumpsitethe same way we did.

28:26.030 --> 28:28.180
They always sayserial killers
makethe best profilers.

28:28.180 --> 28:30.750
Yeah,butthis guy's dead-on.

28:36.230 --> 28:39.070
Yeah.The headline doesn't
mention the shooter at all.

28:39.100 --> 28:41.970
We talked to jim meyers,the reporter,
asked him not to respondto the letter,

28:41.990 --> 28:44.480
he doesn't,and thenthe guy
goes out andshoots 2 more women.

28:44.500 --> 28:47.490
- In a betterpart of town.
- What gives himthis confidence?

28:47.530 --> 28:50.230
What's the significance
of the paper at the scene?

28:50.270 --> 28:53.000
We know he wantsto be newsworthy.
He could've justtossed it aside.

28:53.040 --> 28:55.380
Instead,he displayed it.

28:55.420 --> 28:59.800
There's somethinghe wants us to look at.
There's definitelysomething in the paper.

28:59.820 --> 29:01.510
I thinkI figured it out.

29:04.350 --> 29:05.990
What is it?

29:06.000 --> 29:08.360
They're talking.
In the classifieds.

29:10.200 --> 29:14.540
classifieds,code names.
This feels likean old spy movie.

29:14.540 --> 29:16.600
It's low-tech,simple,but very effective.

29:16.620 --> 29:18.650
They've beendoing this for months,
and nobody ever knew it.

29:18.660 --> 29:22.090
This is the first onethat I found.
The references arewhat made me suspicious.

29:22.090 --> 29:24.750
"Sunny,are you an artist too?

29:24.770 --> 29:28.210
I'd love to see your work
sometime.Holden."

29:28.230 --> 29:30.530
Sunny?
Holden?

29:30.530 --> 29:32.870
They're charactersfrom catcher in the rye.

29:32.890 --> 29:35.130
Widely acceptedas a loved bookof sociopaths.

29:35.160 --> 29:37.410
Mark david chapman quoted it
after killing john lennon.

29:37.420 --> 29:40.960
Deranged minds identifywith
holden's alienationand detachment.

29:40.970 --> 29:44.460
I found the initial contact.
It ran in the paperunchanged for months.

29:44.480 --> 29:48.450
"We have differenttastes,
but I can appreciate your art.Sunny."

29:48.470 --> 29:50.900
Sunny's the hollow man.
He initiated contact.

29:50.920 --> 29:53.520
- What's he gettingout of it?
- A mentor.

29:53.520 --> 29:56.090
Offered admirationand respect.

29:56.110 --> 29:58.190
In return,he gains 
encouragementand confidence.

29:58.220 --> 30:01.330
But when the hollow manremained
unnoticedby the press,

30:01.340 --> 30:04.730
he resented his mentor and
turned itinto a rivalry.

30:04.750 --> 30:06.500
Hollow man became jealous.

30:06.510 --> 30:09.120
They were both killers,but they weren't
seen in the same playing field.

30:09.130 --> 30:11.470
What else did you find?

30:11.470 --> 30:14.510
"An overwhelming area and you never get lost?"

30:14.530 --> 30:16.310
Then the answerto this question.

30:16.310 --> 30:20.470
"I do my research."
It's not so randomwhen you know the area.

30:20.500 --> 30:22.960
I like cotton woodin sgc."

30:22.980 --> 30:25.740
Sgc?He's talking aboutsaltgrass cove.

30:25.770 --> 30:29.150
- He told him howto find meredith dale.
- Why?

30:29.180 --> 30:31.490
Teaching his studenta lesson.

30:31.510 --> 30:33.400
We understandtheir relationship.

30:33.440 --> 30:35.260
Let's use itagainst them.

30:35.260 --> 30:38.050
Hey,sweetness.Make me smile
and tell meyou got a name.

30:38.070 --> 30:41.940
Oh,I got scadsof them,babe,
but none paid for thesepersonal ads.

30:41.970 --> 30:44.790
They went with cash, totally old school.

30:44.800 --> 30:47.960
I hate itwhen they're smart.
2 separate accountsin good standing.

30:47.960 --> 30:50.160
Well,these guysare good.
Thanks.

30:50.190 --> 30:52.730
Garcia saysthey coveredtheir tracks.
How's it goingin here?

30:52.750 --> 30:56.320
Reid's imitatingthe hollow man'slanguage patterns
to send a messageto the mill creek killer.

30:56.350 --> 30:58.480
He's offering condolenceson
losing meredith dale.

30:58.510 --> 31:00.710
Well,if he can'tget to meredith dale,
he's gonna needa body.

31:00.730 --> 31:02.690
He's gonnaneed it real soon.

31:02.710 --> 31:05.830
You guys worriedthat the hollow
man's going to ruinour plan again?

31:05.850 --> 31:08.590
He wants the mill creek killer to get caught.

31:08.620 --> 31:10.950
The pupil's tryingto kill the teacher?

31:11.550 --> 31:12.800
Hope you're close,reid.

31:12.810 --> 31:15.950
You got less than an hour 
to meet the deadline.

31:24.620 --> 31:26.750
You'll be surrounded.

31:27.410 --> 31:30.500
Need you to relax...
as best you can.

31:30.520 --> 31:33.950
This guy's going to wantto get close to you,
and he's goingto want to examine you.

31:33.970 --> 31:36.280
He's going to wantto touch me?

31:37.350 --> 31:41.530
Since you're a gift,not a marked victim,
he might tryto make you his own.

31:41.560 --> 31:42.940
But we're not going to 
let him get that far.

31:42.960 --> 31:46.020
We need him to getclose
to confirmhe's the killer.

31:46.040 --> 31:48.920
There's nothing normal
about this guy.Nothing.

31:49.280 --> 31:51.320
You have any questions?

31:52.580 --> 31:54.490
Let's do this.

31:55.340 --> 31:57.570
Ok.
Down you go.

32:03.540 --> 32:07.640
Close your eyes. Try to relax.

32:20.560 --> 32:22.620
What do you think?
Did it sound likethe hollow man?

32:22.670 --> 32:25.090
Hopefully the mill 
creekkiller will buy it.

32:26.780 --> 32:31.360
"Dear holden,they say imitation"
is the highest formof flattery.

32:31.380 --> 32:35.150
"Since you were almostin harm's way,
"I thought I'd sharesome art.

32:35.170 --> 32:40.720
Should make youfeel better.
here's my gift to you.sunny.

32:53.170 --> 32:54.990
Hello.

33:06.260 --> 33:10.570
Fbi!
Get down!Stay down!

33:14.230 --> 33:16.140
One down,one to go.

33:22.660 --> 33:24.400
Stop right here.

33:24.420 --> 33:26.370
It's going to betough to
pushthrough this crowd.

33:26.470 --> 33:28.030
That's the idea.

33:28.060 --> 33:30.560
I'm getting out.
Securea path to the door.

33:34.670 --> 33:37.910
Everyone,take a step back.
Get back!

33:40.380 --> 33:42.850
What do you have to sayto the families
of the women you killed?

33:42.870 --> 33:44.930
Do you have any remorse
for what you've done?

33:44.960 --> 33:48.330
- You're going to hell.
- You deserve to die!

33:57.000 --> 34:00.500
I've alertedall news outletsthat
we'll be holdinga press conferencein 10 minutes.

34:00.510 --> 34:02.210
- And you havethe script?
- Right here.

34:02.260 --> 34:03.780
Be sure to sayexactly those words.

34:03.800 --> 34:05.780
- The wording'simportant,jj.
- Relax.

34:05.800 --> 34:07.080
It's notmy first party,boys.

34:07.110 --> 34:10.830
Gideon,we don't havemuch on mill creek,
especially if he sayshe stumbled on the body.

34:10.860 --> 34:12.639
So what arewe going to do?

34:12.650 --> 34:14.850
I'll go tryand do my job.

34:23.030 --> 34:24.730
Ok.
Thanks.

34:25.940 --> 34:27.530
You comfortable?

34:27.550 --> 34:30.150
As comfortable as 
anyonecan be in handcuffs.

34:34.760 --> 34:36.330
Let me see.

34:42.290 --> 34:44.090
I'm jason gideon.

34:44.449 --> 34:48.320
You know,I don'tknow
your name or where you're from...

34:48.350 --> 34:51.480
the only thingwe do knowis
you'rean intelligent,good-looking man

34:51.500 --> 34:55.110
with an inflated ego who happens
to likekilling women.

34:55.530 --> 34:59.270
Well,you had metill that last part...
agent gideon.

35:00.310 --> 35:04.620
Imagine how shockedI am,
considering I haven'tdone anything.

35:04.680 --> 35:08.070
I see a woman whoI think is
in distressin the woodsand I get...

35:08.100 --> 35:10.240
pounced on.

35:12.950 --> 35:17.680
Fbi wantsto interview you.
Talk about your work.

35:17.710 --> 35:20.310
We never believed we'dhave you in custody.

35:20.320 --> 35:24.520
I mean,definitelythought the hollow
man would be easierto catch.

35:25.880 --> 35:27.570
Is that upsetting?

35:27.590 --> 35:31.590
I thought the twoof you were friends,
that you admired eachother's work and...

35:31.620 --> 35:33.690
I don't knowthe hollow man.

35:34.140 --> 35:37.360
But if I did,I'd say he sounds like an obsessed fan.

35:37.400 --> 35:40.420
Is that howyou see yourself, as somebody famous?

35:40.440 --> 35:46.120
Well,from what I've read about the mill
creek killer,I'd say he's an artist.

35:46.140 --> 35:48.970
Fascination wasn'tcompletely one-sided.

35:48.990 --> 35:52.000
You did respondto his ads in the paper.

35:52.050 --> 35:55.060
No one can respectwhat
the hollow man has done.

35:56.790 --> 35:59.380
He's got no imagination.

35:59.400 --> 36:00.750
But he's smart.

36:00.770 --> 36:06.120
Foundmeredith dale's body,
even toldthe media about it.

36:06.140 --> 36:08.530
Whoever taught him, taught him very well.

36:08.590 --> 36:11.110
That's very true.

36:11.140 --> 36:13.630
It just soundslike the student
turnson the teacher.

36:13.630 --> 36:15.570
No,no.
He wasprotecting him.

36:15.610 --> 36:16.880
Is that what you think
the hollow manwas doing?

36:16.910 --> 36:18.500
Well,what elsecould it be?

36:18.520 --> 36:21.710
Manipulating you,
gaining your trust.

36:21.720 --> 36:24.270
When he got it,
the hollow manset you up.

36:24.270 --> 36:27.390
You werefront page newS.
Now you'd be a footnote.

36:27.410 --> 36:31.050
Hollow man's out there,you're in here.
It's all because of him.

36:31.080 --> 36:32.830
Is that what you want?

36:32.850 --> 36:36.510
You want meto get angry
to help you catch him?

36:36.520 --> 36:39.280
That is notyour problem,sir.

36:39.300 --> 36:41.700
Then what do you want?

36:41.720 --> 36:43.950
I have just have one question.

36:46.550 --> 36:53.670
If killing those womenmade you an artist,
the thingsyou did to them afterthey were dead...

36:53.690 --> 36:56.600
what does that make you?

36:56.620 --> 36:58.690
I mean,really it...

36:58.700 --> 37:01.360
it just doesn't seemvery artistic,does it?

37:01.370 --> 37:05.450
You went back,you fix their make-up,
you'd comb their hair.

37:05.480 --> 37:07.410
And you visited them...

37:07.430 --> 37:12.470
- over and over and over.
- I didn't do that.

37:12.920 --> 37:16.320
If you thoughtyou were famous before,
wait until the pressgets a hold of you--

37:16.340 --> 37:18.140
- you shut your mouth.
- Details of your visit.

37:18.140 --> 37:19.480
Shut your mouth.
I never went back.

37:19.490 --> 37:20.590
You expect meto believe that
you onlykilled those women?

37:20.610 --> 37:22.480
That it wasn'tyou who kept
visitingthe corpses?

37:22.500 --> 37:25.910
We foundlipstick in your hand
when we caught you.

37:25.930 --> 37:27.790
- You will nottell anyone that.
- Excuse me?

37:27.820 --> 37:29.620
I said you cannever say that.

37:29.630 --> 37:31.070
- You didn't visitthe corpses?
- No.

37:31.100 --> 37:33.420
- No,you justkilled them.
- Yes.

37:34.360 --> 37:37.140
Yes.
I killed them.

37:37.150 --> 37:42.770
But...but you can'ttell anyone...
that I went back.

37:44.470 --> 37:47.290
You can't do that.

37:47.290 --> 37:49.930
The women of st.Louiscan rest easy tonight...

37:49.950 --> 37:53.620
after a long year,the mill
creek killeris in custody.

37:53.620 --> 37:57.700
This manis highly intelligent
and he usesa sophisticated rouse

37:57.730 --> 38:00.060
when luring these womenin public places.

38:00.080 --> 38:03.030
The mill creek killeris someone
the bauwill want to study

38:03.060 --> 38:06.700
as one of the mostcomplex criminals
we've dealt with in years.

38:06.720 --> 38:08.870
- Questions?
- Yes?

38:08.910 --> 38:11.380
What's the fbi doingabout
the other serial killer?

38:11.380 --> 38:13.080
We have new information
about that case.

38:13.080 --> 38:15.080
We no longerbelieve
the shootingsare related.

38:15.100 --> 38:17.100
- Yes?
- What's the new information?

38:17.130 --> 38:18.970
We believe they areisolated incidents,

38:19.020 --> 38:23.160
and we're lookinginto the possibility
that the last 2were copycats.

38:23.210 --> 38:24.150
Jim meyers?

38:24.170 --> 38:26.560
Are you referringto the killer
who callshimself the hollow man?

38:26.600 --> 38:31.340
We believe the personwho wrote
that letteris nothingbut a street thug.

38:31.360 --> 38:35.090
We have evidencethat indicates
that the letterwas just a prank

38:35.120 --> 38:38.090
to throw us offthe investigation
of the mill creek killer.

38:38.110 --> 38:40.470
This is no longera bau case.

38:40.490 --> 38:46.450
It lacks a certainsophistication,class,
there'sjust nothing elegantabout it.

38:46.470 --> 38:49.470
That's all the questions
we'll take for now.Thank you.

38:52.000 --> 38:55.070
Well,we set the bait,
we'll seeif he takes it.

39:09.390 --> 39:12.990
Place your coins,keys,
belts in the basket.

39:13.420 --> 39:15.050
Walk this way.

39:17.280 --> 39:19.410
Walk this way.

39:22.470 --> 39:24.400
Stepto the side,please.

39:24.420 --> 39:27.090
Extend your arms.

39:38.670 --> 39:40.450
Stay down.

39:40.610 --> 39:43.960
give your weaponright now.

39:45.660 --> 39:47.250
Get up.

39:57.150 --> 39:58.960
Where is he?
I wantto see him right now.

39:58.960 --> 40:01.490
You tell himthe hollow man's here.

40:04.420 --> 40:07.350
He told youto say those
things about me,didn't he?

40:07.360 --> 40:09.770
He told youto use those words.

40:25.510 --> 40:26.950
Get him out of here.

40:26.970 --> 40:28.880
I'm no lesselegant than he is.

40:28.910 --> 40:30.280
- I'm no copycat.
- Shut your mouth.

40:30.320 --> 40:33.490
I left youthe newspaper!
I gave youthe mill creek killer!

40:33.550 --> 40:34.640
What elsedo I have to do?

40:34.660 --> 40:36.570
Go!
Get him out of here!

40:59.890 --> 41:01.870
This is the storyfor tomorrow.

41:06.140 --> 41:09.440
"they were our daughters,
sisters,brothers,and friends."

41:13.710 --> 41:18.510
they have every rightto be remembered...
and memorialized.

41:20.200 --> 41:24.070
*There are nonewho live downtown...*

41:26.760 --> 41:28.900
they didn't mentionthe shooter.

41:31.500 --> 41:37.330
He was a nobody whowanted to be somebody
by killing people andthey didn't give him that.

41:38.480 --> 41:40.590
Good.

41:41.490 --> 41:46.690
Mahatma gandhi once said,"remember that allthrough
historythere have been tyrants and murderers

41:46.710 --> 41:48.620
and for a timethey seem invincible..."

41:48.640 --> 41:54.260
*like ancient bruises...*

41:54.280 --> 41:57.670
"but in the end,they always fall.
Always."

41:57.670 --> 42:01.280
*I'm awake to feel...*

42:01.300 --> 42:04.010
please tell meyou haven't been
there for the last 4 days.

42:04.010 --> 42:06.380
I heard you wereflying back tonight.

42:06.400 --> 42:08.650
Heard?How couldyou
have heard a thing like that?

42:08.680 --> 42:10.710
This was dropped offtoday.

42:11.550 --> 42:15.960
I appreciateyour interest,agent,
but profilingis a specialty.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.590
We can't just letanyone
who wants togive it a whirl.

42:18.610 --> 42:21.460
The I-80 killer?
Co-eds in indiana?

42:21.460 --> 42:23.170
Yes,I read iton the plane.

42:23.190 --> 42:26.270
They aren'tblitz attacks.
This guy's organized.

42:26.310 --> 42:29.510
He's a white male,early 30s,
and a smooth talker,

42:29.510 --> 42:32.770
because evenafter 11 victims,
he can still convince

42:32.790 --> 42:36.570
educated women who know there's
a predator out thereto get into his car.

42:36.610 --> 42:38.110
How would youadvise the police?

42:38.130 --> 42:41.400
I would stake outthe ranch house,
a night club in gary.

42:41.400 --> 42:44.150
They have a very popular
ladies night on thursdays.

42:44.170 --> 42:48.340
If you look closely,you'll see that 8 outof
the 11 victimswent missingon a friday morning.

42:48.360 --> 42:51.950
So something gets this creep's
motor runningon thursdays.

42:54.970 --> 42:58.060
This isn't a whirl,agent hotchner.

42:58.130 --> 43:00.190
I don't know how thepaperwork
got screwed up

43:00.210 --> 43:04.810
or maybe youbelieve my parents pulled
some strings,which they didn't,by the way.

43:04.840 --> 43:06.800
I belong in this unit.

43:06.820 --> 43:11.210
And all I'masking you for
is the chanceto show you that.

43:16.040 --> 43:19.230
I still needto look into this.
I'm notpromising anything.

43:19.260 --> 43:20.880
Understood.

43:20.890 --> 43:22.910
We brief new cases
every morning at 10:00 am.

43:22.940 --> 43:25.000
You can see facilities
management about a desk.

43:25.020 --> 43:27.360
You won't be sorry.
