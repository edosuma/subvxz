<i>You could see
just the back end of it.</i>

21:06.565 --> 21:09.200
<i>You could see it barely
back into a parking spot</i>

21:09.301 --> 21:13.671
<i>right by the foyer
of Jennifer's apartment.</i>

21:13.772 --> 21:15.439
<i>I'm pretty sure he knew
what Jennifer drove</i>

21:15.540 --> 21:17.008
<i>and where she lives</i>

21:17.109 --> 21:19.377
<i>because he wasn't driving
around the complex looking.</i>

21:19.478 --> 21:22.346
He went right to that spot,
parked there.

21:22.447 --> 21:25.049
Zoom in the edge.

21:25.150 --> 21:26.517
Keep playing.

21:26.618 --> 21:27.785
[Det. Zenoni]<i> Unfortunately,</i>

21:27.886 --> 21:30.054
<i>from the way the camera
was angled,</i>

21:30.155 --> 21:31.422
<i>you can never see anybody</i>

21:31.490 --> 21:34.425
getting in or out of the car.

21:34.526 --> 21:36.360
<i>The Pontiac arrived
at the apartment complex</i>

21:36.461 --> 21:38.229
<i>at 7:55 in the morning</i>

21:38.330 --> 21:40.398
<i>and left after the shooting</i>

21:40.499 --> 21:43.801
at about 9:21 that morning.

21:43.902 --> 21:46.103
<i>It was 86 minutes</i>

21:46.204 --> 21:48.673
<i>from the time the car backed
into the parking spot</i>

21:48.774 --> 21:53.210
until it was seen leaving
the apartment complex.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.012
[Det. Sgt. Walker]<i> It didn't</i>
<i>actually show the murder,</i>

21:55.113 --> 21:56.881
<i>but it showed enough
to get us where</i>

21:56.982 --> 21:59.083
we needed to jumpstart
the investigation.

22:01.853 --> 22:03.721
[Det. Zenoni]
<i>Now we have a timeline.</i>

22:03.822 --> 22:05.856
<i>We know what time
the guy showed up,</i>

22:05.957 --> 22:09.593
<i>when he left, and what
went on before and after.</i>

22:09.695 --> 22:11.395
The video in the apartment
complex like that

22:11.496 --> 22:13.531
is invaluable.

22:13.632 --> 22:15.099
[narrator]
<i>The image of the Pontiac</i>

<i>is distributed throughout
the department.</i>

22:18.437 --> 22:20.004
[Det. Sgt. Walker]
<i>We put that out immediately</i>

22:20.105 --> 22:24.241
to our officers on the street
to a tip sheet.

22:24.343 --> 22:25.810
[Det. Zenoni]
<i>My initial thought was</i>

22:25.911 --> 22:28.612
it's burned in a field
somewhere or...

22:28.714 --> 22:31.415
<i>driven into a creek.</i>

22:31.516 --> 22:33.718
<i>The longer it went on
before we found it,</i>

22:33.819 --> 22:35.720
<i>I felt less and less likely,</i>

22:35.821 --> 22:36.987
we would've been able to produce

22:37.089 --> 22:38.422
any evidence from it.

<i>for an interview

<i>Larry has no statements

23:00.412 --> 23:02.179

23:02.280 --> 23:05.282
<i>He was just very unemotional.</i>

23:05.384 --> 23:09.153

<i>I had his fingerprints taken</i>

23:15.961 --> 23:17.294

a hundred miles away

[Det. Sgt. Walker]
<i>When we walked up,</i>

25:11.176 --> 25:13.043

<i>That was at that point</i>

what we wanted to see.

27:55.106 --> 27:56.206
[Det. Zenoni]
<i>We established Larry</i>

<i>in the stolen Grand Prix

<i>from the Fiesta Mart
