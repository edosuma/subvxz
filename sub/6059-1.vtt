03:42.997 --> 03:45.291

- What's a pimple on a Polack's ass?
- I need that BLT on rye, Richie.

you're talking about going to L.A.!

Besides, you're too short anyway.

the hamburgers too big again.

08:37.625 --> 08:39.669
Make 'em smaller.

08:41.587 --> 08:43.547
I'll give you small.

08:43.714 --> 08:48.177
This place is so small you have
to go outside to change your mind.

08:55.559 --> 08:57.144
My turn.

08:59.146 --> 09:02.066
Ring, damn you.
I can't believe he didn't call.

09:02.233 --> 09:04.485
- He'll call.
- Do you think so?

09:04.652 --> 09:08.364
- Of course. Why wouldn't he?
- Yeah, why wouldn't he!

09:08.531 --> 09:10.992
Maybe he'll call, I don't know.

09:12.118 --> 09:16.080
When I talked to him, he seemed
funny. Like, "I'll call you later, babe."

09:16.247 --> 09:18.207
I don't think he'll call.

09:18.374 --> 09:20.793
- Don't worry, he'll call.
- You really think so?

09:20.960 --> 09:23.963
- Why wouldn't he?
- You're right. He'll call.

09:24.130 --> 09:27.383
- But if he doesn't call, should I call him?
- He'll call.

09:27.550 --> 09:31.095
I love how you always try
to straighten out other people's lives.

09:31.262 --> 09:34.807
Any time you want me
to straighten out yours, let me know.

09:37.018 --> 09:40.104
Personally, I never call.
Because I don't have to.

09:40.271 --> 09:43.566
- But if you want my advice...
- Not really.

09:45.610 --> 09:47.904
- Hi, girls!
- Hi, Richie.

09:48.070 --> 09:52.116
- Can I help? A foot massage?
- Get out of here!

09:52.283 --> 09:55.661
- It's been long since he's had some.
- I bet.

What?

10:09.634 --> 10:12.053

10:13.804 --> 10:16.599
- I just wanted to say hi.

10:39.121 --> 10:42.041
- You speak French?
- No. I just like the pictures.

10:42.208 --> 10:43.292
Me too.

10:43.459 --> 10:47.713
- Nick. They need you on ten.
- I'll be right there.

10:48.256 --> 10:50.299
- You read Vogue?
- I used to.

10:50.466 --> 10:52.426
My wife does.
I mean, my ex-wife.

10:52.593 --> 10:55.012

We're divorced.

10:55.888 --> 10:57.014
Sorry.

Now, more important,
did you go to the repertory?

I meant to. I was going to go
yesterday, but I didn't have time.

20:29.045 --> 20:32.506
- You must make the time, child.
- I know.

20:32.673 --> 20:36.010
Remember the first time
you took me to see them dance?

20:36.177 --> 20:37.845
I have dreams about it.

20:38.012 --> 20:42.642
Dreaming is wonderful, but it won't
get you closer to what you want.

20:42.808 --> 20:46.062
But I've saved money, so if they take me,
I can support myself.

20:46.229 --> 20:52.652
But, child, they won't take you
unless you apply and audition.

20:53.611 --> 20:58.491

- Alexandra, you are 18 years old.

21:45.121 --> 21:47.206
I'm doing OK. Sort of.

I've been thinking about sex a lot.
But you can't help thinking about sex.

21:55.256 --> 21:57.967
You probably can...
Help it, I mean.

22:00.177 --> 22:02.305
Also, I told a lie.

Well, I didn't have to, but...

to get the application.

He says Richie is no good.

how to dance that way?

more along the lines of Jupiter.

- Well, my father, he loves music.

This one time, he took us all
to the symphony, my whole family.

46:02.036 --> 46:04.956
It was supposed to be
this really big deal.

46:05.915 --> 46:07.833
At first I didn't like it very much.

46:08.000 --> 46:12.088
There is nothing to do with your feet
and there's nothing to look at.

you can see the music."

46:27.061 --> 46:28.980
You can, too.

01:04:16.339 --> 01:04:18.799
You didn't look this good
when we were married.

01:04:18.966 --> 01:04:22.178
- It was the company I was keeping.
- That was good. That's funny.

01:04:22.345 --> 01:04:26.724
Has he taken you to the steel mill?
He likes to go there on his first date.

01:04:26.891 --> 01:04:30.269
- That was your first date, wasn't it?
- Yeah, it was.

01:04:30.436 --> 01:04:35.816
As a matter of fact...
I fucked his brains out.

01:04:43.032 --> 01:04:45.076
Obviously, you did.

01:04:45.576 --> 01:04:46.953
Charmed, dear.

01:04:49.455 --> 01:04:52.291
You loved her once, didn't you?

01:04:54.168 --> 01:04:56.003
I thought I did in the beginning.

01:04:57.338 --> 01:05:01.259
She was different from anyone
I had gone out with before, she was...

01:05:01.425 --> 01:05:04.720
Well educated.
Came from a real good family.

01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:10.935
I figured that I had really made it.

01:05:11.686 --> 01:05:14.897
And one day, I realised that...

01:05:18.234 --> 01:05:20.152
I'd just taken the safe route.

01:05:22.738 --> 01:05:27.535
When I realised that, it made it easier
for me to do what I had to do.

01:05:27.702 --> 01:05:29.787
What was that?

01:05:30.746 --> 01:05:33.374
Let go. Start over again.

01:05:35.084 --> 01:05:38.713
Figure out what it was
I wanted to do and go after it.

01:05:40.506 --> 01:05:42.675
You got it, didn't you?

01:05:51.058 --> 01:05:52.894
How did you do it?

01:05:54.896 --> 01:05:57.732
I took a deep breath and jumped.

01:06:03.321 --> 01:06:04.322
Hello.

01:06:05.156 --> 01:06:08.367
I'd like to apply for admission
to the Repertory Company.

01:06:08.534 --> 01:06:10.453
When you fill out this application,

01:06:10.620 --> 01:06:13.623
write down all your years
of previous dance training.

01:06:13.789 --> 01:06:16.125
Starting with the last school
you attended.

01:06:16.292 --> 01:06:18.419
I know that part.

01:06:18.586 --> 01:06:20.796
Auditions are by invitation only

01:06:20.963 --> 01:06:23.216
and are performed
before the committee

01:06:23.382 --> 01:06:26.928
and select members
of the Repertory Company.

01:06:27.094 --> 01:06:28.179
Thank you.

01:06:28.346 --> 01:06:30.306
You're welcome.

01:06:53.621 --> 01:06:55.164
Good morning.

01:07:03.089 --> 01:07:05.800
Good morning.
May I help you?

01:07:05.967 --> 01:07:10.930
Yes. There was a young woman here
a short time ago, wearing an army jacket.

01:07:11.097 --> 01:07:13.599
She was here.
I was talking to her...

01:07:13.766 --> 01:07:16.269
about admission
to the Repertory Company.

01:07:18.145 --> 01:07:20.064
(Murmer of conversation)

01:07:27.071 --> 01:07:28.698

01:07:37.164 --> 01:07:39.166
Great. Great.

01:07:39.709 --> 01:07:42.336
Listen, are you still
on the Arts Council?

01:07:43.337 --> 01:07:45.506
I need a favour for a special friend.

I told you they didn't like
short people down there.

01:09:06.879 --> 01:09:08.256
Richie!

01:09:11.551 --> 01:09:14.220
- Did you check out the clubs there?
- Yeah.

01:09:15.345 --> 01:09:18.265
- Come on, what happened?
- One of them offered me a job.

01:09:19.267 --> 01:09:20.643
That's great.

01:09:20.810 --> 01:09:23.729
As a waiter. I said,
"Me, a waiter? You got to be crazy.

01:09:23.895 --> 01:09:27.149
"I can't take a job as a waiter.
I'm a cook."

01:09:30.528 --> 01:09:31.654
Hi, Richie.

01:09:35.157 --> 01:09:36.450
Hi, Jeanie.

01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:42.290
- I missed you.
- All those girls out there?

01:09:42.456 --> 01:09:44.375
There were no girls out there.

01:09:44.542 --> 01:09:47.420

01:09:51.048 --> 01:09:54.051
Or is it the comedian?
Nice suit, Richie.

01:09:55.595 --> 01:09:58.973
- Let's go, Jeanie.
- See you later, Richie.

01:09:59.140 --> 01:10:01.392

I got it! I got it!

01:11:19.262 --> 01:11:21.138
Nick, wait up!

01:11:24.517 --> 01:11:27.019
- Look! Wait!
- What's going on?

01:11:27.186 --> 01:11:28.813
- Read it.
- What?

01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:32.525
I got the audition, look.
I applied for the Repertory Company.

01:11:32.692 --> 01:11:36.529
You have to be invited before
you can audition and they invited me.

01:11:36.696 --> 01:11:40.241
That's wonderful.
We have to do something about it.

01:11:40.408 --> 01:11:41.409
When?

01:11:41.576 --> 01:11:44.078
- How about tonight?
- Yes.

01:11:50.626 --> 01:11:51.627

01:11:52.086 --> 01:11:53.588
Hanna?

01:11:55.965 --> 01:11:58.801
Well... I did it.

01:11:58.968 --> 01:12:03.598
I knew you would.
Congratulations.

01:12:03.764 --> 01:12:05.892
I'm so excited I can't stop shaking.

01:12:07.602 --> 01:12:09.687
But what if I don't make it?

01:12:12.273 --> 01:12:14.191
You will.
I know you will.

01:12:16.861 --> 01:12:19.238
What would I do without you?

01:12:24.285 --> 01:12:26.162
I loved the dinner.

01:12:26.329 --> 01:12:28.664
And I loved the way
they sat us right away.

01:12:30.249 --> 01:12:34.378
I loved that there were 50 people
waiting and we just whizzed in.

01:12:36.797 --> 01:12:39.050
I called the restaurant last night...

01:12:40.134 --> 01:12:42.762
and told them it was
a very special occasion.

01:12:50.144 --> 01:12:52.730
What do you mean
you called them last night?

01:12:52.897 --> 01:12:54.690
- Stop the car.
- Why?

01:12:54.857 --> 01:12:56.525
Stop the goddamn car!

01:12:56.692 --> 01:12:58.319
You called them last night

01:12:58.486 --> 01:13:01.572
but I didn't tell you
I got the audition until this morning.

01:13:01.739 --> 01:13:03.491
So how the hell did you know?

01:13:03.658 --> 01:13:06.244
- Listen.
- Friends on the committee?

01:13:06.410 --> 01:13:08.538
Asshole! Stop the car!

01:13:08.704 --> 01:13:10.206

- Let me go.

I don't want you to help me!

01:13:22.051 --> 01:13:26.305
You're going to get yourself killed!
All I did was make a phone call.

01:13:26.472 --> 01:13:29.475
I got you the audition,
the rest is up to you.

01:13:31.185 --> 01:13:35.856
