I brought you a present.

40:55.067 --> 40:56.701
Remember how we talked about

40:56.701 --> 40:59.167
finding someone
you could share the music with?

41:00.267 --> 41:02.067
Someone who
understood completely

41:02.067 --> 41:04.467
and how it was worth it
for all that?

41:05.601 --> 41:07.434
You know the Mendelssohn?

41:07.434 --> 41:08.367
Yeah.

41:12.100 --> 41:15.434
[VIOLIN PLAYING SOFT MUSIC
ON TAPE RECORDER]

41:22.167 --> 41:23.133
It's your mom.

41:27.567 --> 41:29.234
Why don't you play it with her?

41:35.000 --> 41:36.067
Play with her.

 <i>Dear Gary,</i>

42:15.968 --> 42:17.601
 <i>Thank you</i>
 <i>for reading my story story</i>

42:17.601 --> 42:19.400
 <i>and for your criticisms.</i>

42:19.400 --> 42:22.133
 <i>You definitely gave me</i>
 <i>a lot to think about.</i>

42:25.734 --> 42:27.400
 <i>I have this habit.</i>

42:27.400 --> 42:29.000
 <i>I've always done this.</i>

42:29.000 --> 42:30.701
 <i>Whenever I get a new book,</i>

42:30.701 --> 42:33.100
 <i>I turn to the last page first</i>

42:33.100 --> 42:36.167
 <i>because I need to know</i>
 <i>how things are gonna turn out.</i>

42:38.767 --> 42:41.000
 <i>I've decided</i>
 <i>I'm not gonna do that anymore.</i>

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
 <i>And maybe I wouldn't have</i>
 <i>figured that out</i>

42:43.000 --> 42:45.400
 <i>if I hadn't met you.</i>

42:45.400 --> 42:47.601
 <i>I don't know if that's gonna</i>
 <i>make sense to you or not,</i>

42:47.601 --> 42:50.434
 <i>but I think that's really</i>
 <i>what I'm thanking you for.</i>

42:53.934 --> 42:56.634
 <i>As for what</i>
 <i>you said about my work,</i>

42:56.634 --> 42:58.067
 <i>maybe you're right.</i>

42:58.067 --> 43:00.234
 <i>But maybe you aren't.</i>

43:00.234 --> 43:03.234
 <i>A-And maybe I will become</i>
 <i>a writer and maybe I won't.</i>

43:03.234 --> 43:05.334
 <i>I don't know.</i>

43:05.334 --> 43:09.167
 <i>Hm. I haven't read</i>
 <i>the last page yet.</i>
