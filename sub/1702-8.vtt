WEBVTT

00:02.127 --> 00:03.502
Here you go, Pheebs.

00:03.711 --> 00:06.338
Who wants one of my
special home-baked brownies?

00:06.548 --> 00:07.589
I'll have one.

00:08.550 --> 00:09.967
Agh! Ugh.

00:10.135 --> 00:12.177
- That's okay.
- I'm not having one.

00:12.887 --> 00:14.888
No, no. It's just my tooth.

00:15.140 --> 00:16.974
- All right.
- I'll have one.

00:18.101 --> 00:20.686
So you need a dentist?
I've got a good one.

00:20.854 --> 00:25.107
Thanks. I have a good one too.
I just can't see him.

00:25.358 --> 00:28.193
See, that is the problem
with invisible dentists.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.280
Why can't you go to him?

00:31.448 --> 00:36.368
Because every time I go
to the dentist, somebody dies.

00:37.662 --> 00:40.497
That's so weird.
Every time I go to the dentist...

00:40.707 --> 00:42.875
...I look down the hygienist's blouse.

00:43.918 --> 00:46.295
Phoebe, what, um?

00:46.463 --> 00:47.546
What?

00:47.714 --> 00:49.298
First, it was my Aunt Mary.

00:49.549 --> 00:52.092
And then there was, um,
John, my mailman.

00:52.260 --> 00:54.887
And then my cowboy friend, Albino Bob.

00:55.889 --> 00:58.307
Ahem. And all these people actually died?

00:58.475 --> 01:00.684
Yes. While I was in the chair.

01:00.852 --> 01:04.021
That's why I take care of my teeth.
It's not about oral hygiene.

01:04.272 --> 01:06.315
I floss to save lives.

01:07.317 --> 01:09.151
Come on, you didn't kill anybody.

01:09.402 --> 01:13.072
These people just happened to die
when you went to the dentist.

01:13.281 --> 01:14.740
It's just a coincidence.

01:14.949 --> 01:17.743
Tell that to them.
Oh, you can't! They're dead!

02:08.877 --> 02:09.919
Thanks, Gunther.

02:10.088 --> 02:11.380
- Hi.
- Hey.

02:11.548 --> 02:13.006
Um, can I get a napkin too?

02:13.174 --> 02:15.843
Oh, like you don't already
have everything.

02:17.637 --> 02:20.013
Ow!

02:21.182 --> 02:24.852
You're in pain. Would you just
go to the dentist? Just go.

02:25.019 --> 02:27.146
Fine. But if you're my next victim...

02:27.313 --> 02:30.649
...don't come back as a poltergeist
who sucks me into the TV set.

02:31.442 --> 02:32.484
I promise.

02:32.652 --> 02:34.570
Although, don't feel like you can't visit.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.700
Hey, is Chandler here?

02:41.119 --> 02:42.452
No. No, he's not.

02:43.955 --> 02:48.584
You guys, Joey just saw
Janice kissing her ex-husband.

02:48.793 --> 02:50.002
- Huh? Oh!
- What?

02:50.170 --> 02:53.213
What are you gonna do?
How are you gonna tell Chandler?

02:53.381 --> 02:56.633
I was thinking about that.
I think the best way would be...

02:56.801 --> 02:57.843
...to not.

02:58.761 --> 03:02.014
Joey, if you know about this,
you have to tell him.

03:02.182 --> 03:04.474
It'll kill him. It'll just kill him.

03:04.642 --> 03:07.519
Wait till I go to the dentist.
Maybe I'll kill him.

03:11.608 --> 03:13.025
Ew!

03:13.193 --> 03:18.113
Ugly Naked Guy's using a hammock.
It's like a Play-Doh fat factory.

03:19.115 --> 03:21.200
I'm going to the dentist. So listen...

03:21.367 --> 03:25.621
...just be on the lookout for anything
that you could fall into...

03:25.788 --> 03:28.457
...or that can fall on you...

03:28.625 --> 03:30.000
...or...

03:30.168 --> 03:31.543
All right, just look out!

03:32.045 --> 03:35.547
Okay? And, um, I also just want to...

03:35.882 --> 03:38.967
I just want to tell you all that, um...

03:44.265 --> 03:47.434
I have a problem. I have to go
into work for a few hours.

03:47.602 --> 03:49.978
Some kids messed up
the Homo sapien display.

03:50.146 --> 03:51.563
What did they do?

03:51.731 --> 03:54.858
They painted over the word
"sapien," for one thing.

03:55.735 --> 04:00.614
Then they rearranged the figures.
Let's just leave it at that.

04:00.782 --> 04:02.574
Do you want me to watch Ben for you?

04:02.742 --> 04:04.534
Yes, that's what I was gonna ask.
Thank you.

04:04.702 --> 04:07.537
Woah, wait, hello! Heh, what about me?

04:07.705 --> 04:11.124
You. You want to watch Ben?

04:15.546 --> 04:17.964
That would be great!
I just asked Monica...

04:18.132 --> 04:20.425
...because I know how empty her life is.

04:24.847 --> 04:27.516
- Hey, Ross? I got a science question.
- Yeah. Mm-hm.

04:27.684 --> 04:33.480
If the Homo sapiens were, in fact,
"homo" sapiens...

04:34.857 --> 04:36.400
...is that why they're extinct?

04:40.321 --> 04:43.448
Joey, Homo sapiens are people.

04:43.616 --> 04:44.950
Hey, I'm not judging.

04:47.954 --> 04:50.163
Look, Benny! Spoon!

04:50.623 --> 04:52.457
Spoon!

04:53.835 --> 04:56.795
Come on. All right, you know what?
I think he's bored.

04:57.213 --> 04:59.506
Here. You wanna play
the airplane game?

04:59.716 --> 05:01.633
You wanna show Rachel? Come here.

05:01.801 --> 05:03.885
You wanna do something fun? Okay.

05:04.053 --> 05:05.220
Whee!

05:07.765 --> 05:10.225
Whee! Ha, ha, oh!

05:15.231 --> 05:18.358
You're so brave.
You're so brave! Yes, you are.

05:18.526 --> 05:20.444
- You're so brave.
- You're okay.

05:20.611 --> 05:22.863
He's fine. Let's just put him down.

05:23.031 --> 05:25.949
Come here, babe.
Yes, you're such a good boy.

05:26.117 --> 05:30.370
How could you do that to him?
Ross trusted me! What's he gonna say?

05:30.538 --> 05:32.581
Nothing, because we're not telling him.

05:32.749 --> 05:33.915
- We're not?
- No.

05:34.083 --> 05:36.084
- All right, I like that.
- Okay.

05:36.836 --> 05:39.171
So we're okay. We're okay, aren't we?

05:39.339 --> 05:41.048
No, we're not okay. There's a bump.

05:41.215 --> 05:42.924
- There's a bump.
- What bump?

05:43.092 --> 05:45.635
Oh, my God! Well, push it in! Push it in!

05:45.803 --> 05:48.597
I can not push it in!

05:49.432 --> 05:51.558
- Okay, we're gonna need a distraction.
- Okay.

05:51.726 --> 05:52.976
- That's it.
- Okay.

05:53.144 --> 05:54.311
- I got it!
- Okay.

05:54.479 --> 05:56.188
- The second Ross walks in...
- Yeah.

05:56.356 --> 05:59.649
...take him to your bedroom and do
whatever you do that makes him go:

06:02.945 --> 06:04.780
Or...

06:06.282 --> 06:08.116
...we could put a hat on his head.

06:08.284 --> 06:13.121
A hat! Yes! We need a hat! Where
are we gonna find a tiny little hat?

06:13.289 --> 06:14.956
Oh, oh, oh! I'll get Rainy Day Bear!

06:15.124 --> 06:17.459
Because he'll know what to do?

06:17.794 --> 06:19.378
Oh, my God. You're a genius!

06:19.545 --> 06:21.463
Oh, God. It's kind of sewn on.

06:21.631 --> 06:23.090
- Give it. Give it.
- Okay.

06:23.466 --> 06:24.674
- Oh!
- Oh.

06:27.303 --> 06:30.806
Agh, it's just like a bloodbath
in here today!

06:36.145 --> 06:38.438
Hey, hold on a second.
Hold on a second.

06:40.108 --> 06:42.401
Do you think these pearls are nice?

06:42.693 --> 06:44.444
I'd prefer a mountain bike.

06:45.905 --> 06:48.990
Janice's birthday's coming.
I wanna get her something special.

06:50.410 --> 06:53.203
- Come in here with me.
- Woah, woah, whoa, wait. Woah.

06:55.289 --> 06:57.666
You wanna get her something special?
Get her flowers.

06:57.834 --> 07:00.585
Get her candy. Get her gum.
Girls love gum.

07:01.295 --> 07:04.756
That's a good idea. "Dear Janice:
Have a Hubba-Bubba birthday."

07:06.134 --> 07:08.343
I'd like to get her something serious.

07:08.511 --> 07:11.096
Oh, you want something serious.

07:11.264 --> 07:14.599
You know what you should do?
You should get her one of those, um...

07:14.767 --> 07:16.226
...barium enemas.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.272
Those are dead serious.

07:20.440 --> 07:25.110
Look, I'm gonna go in here.
And you don't buy me anything, ever!

07:25.278 --> 07:27.946
You can't! You can't.
You can't buy her pearls.

07:28.114 --> 07:30.532
You just can't, you can't, you can't!

07:30.700 --> 07:32.451
Why not?

07:33.995 --> 07:36.288
Oh, God. Uh, okay.

07:37.039 --> 07:38.957
Here's the thing. Ahem.

07:39.625 --> 07:41.668
This is the thing. Okay, the thing is...

07:41.836 --> 07:42.961
- What is the thing?
- Okay.

07:44.714 --> 07:47.924
I went down to the
Mattress King's showroom...

07:48.176 --> 07:51.011
...and I saw Janice kissing
her ex-husband.

07:52.930 --> 07:54.306
What?

07:54.474 --> 07:56.099
They were in his office.

07:59.270 --> 08:02.314
Well, she... She wouldn't do that.
She's with me.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.149
I'm telling you, I saw it.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.234
Well, you're wrong. Okay? You're wrong.

08:06.402 --> 08:08.069
I'm not wrong.

08:08.237 --> 08:10.447
I wish I was.

08:12.200 --> 08:13.950
I'm sorry.

08:17.705 --> 08:20.373
Bet that barium enema
doesn't sound so bad now, huh?

08:23.169 --> 08:28.048
It makes more sense as an ensemble.
And it takes the focus off the hat.

08:28.841 --> 08:31.968
Oh! You're alive! You're alive!

08:33.179 --> 08:35.804
See? I promised you
no one would die, didn't I?

08:35.972 --> 08:39.518
We'll see about that. Can I use your
phone to call everyone I know?

08:39.684 --> 08:42.479
Sure. We have no money. Go ahead.

08:43.773 --> 08:46.983
Hey, you're not dead! Okay, see you.

08:49.195 --> 08:50.737
Monica.

08:51.072 --> 08:53.573
Oh, my God! He just said my name!

08:53.741 --> 08:55.575
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

08:56.285 --> 08:58.161
Monica bang!

09:01.040 --> 09:03.792
Ahem. Okay, I heard that.

09:03.960 --> 09:06.294
- Did he just say, "Monica bang"?
- Mm-hm.

09:06.462 --> 09:09.130
Oh, my God! He's gonna rat me out!

09:09.799 --> 09:12.425
- Monica bang!
- Oh, ho, ho.

09:12.927 --> 09:16.346
Sweetie, you need to stop
saying that now.

09:16.514 --> 09:19.099
It's no big deal.
It's not even worth mentioning.

09:19.267 --> 09:21.351
You see? We all do it all the time.

09:21.519 --> 09:22.644
See? Watch this.

09:22.812 --> 09:24.771
Ben, Ben, Ben. Ow.

09:24.939 --> 09:27.649
Monica bang!
Everybody bang!

09:27.817 --> 09:29.150
Ben bang!

09:29.318 --> 09:30.944
Rachel bang!

09:31.112 --> 09:33.113
Bang, Rachel! Bang!

09:33.656 --> 09:36.157
- Oh, isn't it fun?
- Look at that! Look at that!

09:36.826 --> 09:38.201
We all do it!

09:38.369 --> 09:40.662
- Okay, I'm stopping now.
- Are you okay?

09:41.122 --> 09:44.916
Oh, yeah. You know, if it's not
a headboard, it's just not worth it.

09:56.012 --> 09:58.096
How's my Bing-a-ling?

09:59.765 --> 10:01.266
Uh...

10:01.976 --> 10:03.018
I don't know.

10:03.811 --> 10:05.228
You tell me.

10:06.230 --> 10:09.357
Anything you, uh, want to tell me?

10:09.525 --> 10:11.276
Because if you, uh... You should...

10:11.444 --> 10:13.570
You would tell me.

10:15.031 --> 10:18.033
Why are your eyes so wide?

10:18.826 --> 10:20.493
You tell me.

10:20.870 --> 10:23.496
Maybe it's because I was just
fooling around with my ex.

10:23.664 --> 10:26.124
Oh, no. No, no, no. That was you!

10:26.292 --> 10:27.667
Oh, my God!

10:27.835 --> 10:29.669
- All right!
- How did you know?

10:29.837 --> 10:32.005
Joey told me. He saw you two kissing.

10:32.173 --> 10:33.715
In the park?

10:34.884 --> 10:37.677
No. In his office.
How many kisses were there?

10:37.845 --> 10:40.597
- Just those two!
- Wh...? Why? Why?

10:40.765 --> 10:43.558
Why was there kissing?
There should be no kissing!

10:43.726 --> 10:46.478
Oh, I'm sorry, honey. I'm so, so...

10:47.855 --> 10:49.439
I'm so, so sorry. I just...

10:51.817 --> 10:54.569
What happened was I...
I can't breathe.

10:54.737 --> 10:58.490
Can you get me a bag or something?
Aah.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.158
- Here. Here.
- Aah.

11:00.326 --> 11:01.409
There.

11:04.914 --> 11:07.165
- It's the receipt.
- I'll take it.

11:08.626 --> 11:10.460
Look, I've got to know.

11:13.214 --> 11:14.756
Are you finished with me?

11:17.718 --> 11:19.386
Are you finished with him?

11:23.641 --> 11:25.767
Do you still love him?

11:28.729 --> 11:30.146
Do you still love me?

11:32.274 --> 11:33.483
All right, look...

11:34.610 --> 11:37.237
...I'm gonna need an actual
answer here, okay?

11:37.405 --> 11:39.322
So which is it?

11:40.658 --> 11:42.033
Him or me?

11:51.168 --> 11:53.253
I don't know.

11:55.214 --> 11:58.925
Okay, if you're alive,
you answer your phone!

12:03.347 --> 12:07.767
Ben, I won't tell your daddy
that you had ice cream before dinner...

12:07.935 --> 12:11.771
...if you won't tell him about
our little bonking incident.

12:11.939 --> 12:15.400
Number one, I don't think Ben
understands the concept of bribery.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.277
And number two, I...

12:19.488 --> 12:20.488
What?

12:20.656 --> 12:23.116
You said "number two."

12:26.120 --> 12:27.412
I also said "number one."

12:27.580 --> 12:29.164
Ha-ha-ha, I know.

12:32.251 --> 12:33.334
- Hey, everyone!
- Hi!

12:33.502 --> 12:35.503
How's my little boy?

12:35.671 --> 12:37.672
He's perfect. Aren't you, Ben?

12:37.840 --> 12:40.550
- He's never been better.
- What did you do, take him whaling?

12:43.429 --> 12:45.054
Monica.

12:45.222 --> 12:49.601
Oh, my God! He just said your name!
That's great! Good job, Ben!

12:50.186 --> 12:52.020
Monica bang!

12:52.188 --> 12:53.688
Ha-ha-ha. That's right.

12:53.856 --> 12:56.775
That's what I'd sound like
if I exploded.

12:58.944 --> 13:01.404
Woo-hoo! The curse is broken!
I called everybody I know...

13:01.572 --> 13:03.448
...and everyone is alive!

13:06.452 --> 13:07.619
- Huh.
- What?

13:08.871 --> 13:12.040
Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still.

13:17.671 --> 13:19.422
Oh, my God, I killed another one!

13:19.590 --> 13:23.676
The curse is getting stronger too,
to bring down something that big.

13:23.844 --> 13:26.095
Maybe he's just taking a nap.

13:26.263 --> 13:28.807
I'm telling you,
he hasn't moved since this morning.

13:28.974 --> 13:30.475
We should call somebody.

13:30.643 --> 13:33.895
Tell them the naked guy we stare at
isn't moving?

13:34.063 --> 13:36.397
We've got to find out if he's alive.

13:36.565 --> 13:39.025
How are we gonna do that?
There's no way.

13:39.193 --> 13:40.985
Well, there is one way.

13:41.153 --> 13:44.072
His window's open. I say...

13:44.240 --> 13:45.740
...we poke him.

13:49.370 --> 13:50.995
Hey!

13:51.163 --> 13:53.748
You know how we, uh,
save all those chopsticks...

13:53.916 --> 13:56.376
...for no reason
when we get Chinese food?

13:56.544 --> 13:57.669
Yeah?

13:57.837 --> 14:00.255
Well, now we got a reason.

14:01.090 --> 14:02.215
What?

14:02.383 --> 14:05.301
Well, we're fashioning a very long
poking device.

14:07.263 --> 14:08.763
All right.

14:11.433 --> 14:13.893
Hey, uh, what's the matter?

14:15.980 --> 14:18.022
I talked to Janice.

14:18.190 --> 14:21.276
Oh, my God. Is she going back to him?

14:21.610 --> 14:23.111
She doesn't know.

14:23.279 --> 14:24.779
Says she loves us both.

14:26.448 --> 14:29.450
I woke up this morning, I was in love.

14:29.618 --> 14:31.411
I was happy!

14:32.955 --> 14:35.582
It serves me right for buying
that 12-pack of condoms.

14:37.960 --> 14:41.796
And now I can't even return them,
because she choked on the receipt!

14:45.009 --> 14:47.176
What are you, uh...?
What are you gonna do?

14:49.972 --> 14:51.806
I don't know.

14:52.474 --> 14:54.434
You know? What would you do?

14:56.979 --> 14:58.855
Uh, it doesn't matter what I'd do.

14:59.023 --> 15:00.690
Come on. Come on. Tell me.

15:03.611 --> 15:05.111
All right, you, uh...

15:06.572 --> 15:09.741
...you probably won't want
to hear this, but, uh...

15:11.744 --> 15:15.496
...if it was me,
and this is just me, I would, uh...

15:15.664 --> 15:17.832
- I would bow out.
- What?

15:20.210 --> 15:22.045
What are you talking about?

15:25.215 --> 15:26.966
They have a kid together...

15:27.134 --> 15:29.552
...you know? They're like...

15:29.845 --> 15:32.013
They're, like, a family.

15:32.556 --> 15:34.515
And if, I don't know...

15:34.683 --> 15:38.019
...if there's a chance
they can make that work...

15:38.187 --> 15:41.022
...I wouldn't want to be the guy
who stood in the way.

15:45.903 --> 15:47.362
You okay?

15:48.906 --> 15:50.406
You, uh?

15:51.033 --> 15:52.700
You wanna come poke a nude guy?

15:56.121 --> 15:59.082
- Well, he's finally asleep.
- Mm.

15:59.249 --> 16:02.418
About that, uh, bump on his head...

16:03.212 --> 16:05.755
Are you, uh, sure it's a new bump?

16:05.923 --> 16:10.176
No offense, but I've always thought
of Ben as a fairly bumpy-headed child.

16:10.344 --> 16:13.846
It's okay if he bumps his head.
Kids bump their heads all the time.

16:14.014 --> 16:17.141
It was your first time babysitting.
You did your best.

16:17.726 --> 16:19.727
- I did!
- I know.

16:19.895 --> 16:22.230
You just have to watch them
all the time.

16:22.398 --> 16:25.233
I did! I watched! I watched!

16:25.401 --> 16:28.903
I watched Monica bang his head
against that thing!

16:29.905 --> 16:31.447
Monica did it?

16:34.576 --> 16:36.411
- Monica? Um...
- Yeah.

16:36.578 --> 16:40.581
Did you notice anything weird
about Ben today?

16:41.625 --> 16:42.709
No, why?

16:42.876 --> 16:46.963
I was just playing with him, and we
were doing the "Alphabet Song"...

16:47.131 --> 16:50.174
...which he's good at.
But he left out "E" and "F."

16:50.342 --> 16:54.762
It's like they just, uh, I don't know,
fell out of his head.

16:56.348 --> 16:57.432
Really?

16:57.599 --> 17:00.810
Oh, and also, he's walking...

17:01.395 --> 17:02.603
...kind of funny.

17:04.231 --> 17:08.776
It's like his left leg is moving
a lot faster than his right leg.

17:08.944 --> 17:12.113
Yeah, he's in there,
just sort of, you know...

17:14.657 --> 17:17.785
Oh, my God! I wrecked your baby!

17:20.289 --> 17:23.124
I hope it's still funny
when you're in hell.

17:24.209 --> 17:25.334
You jerk!

17:25.502 --> 17:30.631
- You know I love that kid!
- Monica bang! Monica bang!

17:31.508 --> 17:32.925
Ow.

17:33.719 --> 17:35.678
I'll get the hat.

17:39.641 --> 17:41.726
I have something to tell you.

17:41.894 --> 17:44.062
And I want you to let me
get through it...

17:44.229 --> 17:46.147
...because...

17:46.523 --> 17:49.025
...it's not gonna be easy.

17:49.818 --> 17:51.069
Okay.

17:53.447 --> 17:55.531
I think you should go back with Gary.

17:57.534 --> 18:00.411
I don't want to be the guy
that breaks up a family.

18:01.246 --> 18:04.707
You know, when my parents split up,
it was because of that guy.

18:04.958 --> 18:07.126
Whenever I'd see him,
I'd always think:

18:07.377 --> 18:10.880
"You're the reason.
You are why they're not together."

18:11.131 --> 18:14.050
And I hated that guy.

18:15.219 --> 18:20.139
And it didn't matter how nice he was
or how happy he made my dad.

18:24.895 --> 18:26.687
Wow!

18:27.439 --> 18:29.315
Yeah, wow.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.361
- It's the right thing to do.
- Ugh.

18:33.529 --> 18:35.446
You're right.

18:36.323 --> 18:41.661
Oh, God.
But before I can say goodbye...

18:42.204 --> 18:45.456
...there's something I really
need you to know.

18:45.958 --> 18:48.584
The way I feel about you...

18:48.877 --> 18:51.963
...it's like I finally understand...

18:52.214 --> 18:54.549
...what Lionel Richie's
been singing about.

18:56.176 --> 18:58.052
You know? I mean, what we have...

18:58.220 --> 19:01.139
...it's like movie love.

19:02.391 --> 19:04.308
You're my soul mate.

19:05.352 --> 19:09.647
I can't believe we're not gonna
spend the rest of our lives together.

19:11.483 --> 19:13.151
Then don't leave me.

19:14.444 --> 19:15.486
What?

19:15.654 --> 19:18.614
Forget what I said! I was babbling!
Pick me!

19:18.782 --> 19:22.493
No, you were right!
I gotta give my marriage another chance.

19:22.661 --> 19:24.662
Pssh! No, you don't!

19:24.830 --> 19:28.666
No, I say you have to give your divorce
another chance!

19:31.545 --> 19:32.879
I'm sorry.

19:37.467 --> 19:39.594
Oh, don't go.

19:40.262 --> 19:41.929
No, I gotta go.

19:42.764 --> 19:46.309
No. No. No, no.

19:46.476 --> 19:48.519
Honey. Honey. Ha, ha.

19:48.687 --> 19:51.063
- People are looking.
- I don't care.

19:51.982 --> 19:53.608
I don't care!

19:54.151 --> 19:56.986
Yeah, um, okay. I'm...

19:57.154 --> 19:58.696
I'm leaving now.

20:01.158 --> 20:03.743
You can't leave! I have your shoe!

20:07.497 --> 20:09.832
Goodbye, Chandler Bing.

20:21.303 --> 20:23.095
Rachel has those in burgundy.

20:26.850 --> 20:31.562
Remember, something this big and long
will be very difficult to maneuver.

20:31.772 --> 20:33.814
Fortunately,
I have experience in that area.

20:35.192 --> 20:39.987
Can we please focus here?
A naked man's life hangs in the balance.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.614
I'm telling you, he's dead.

20:41.823 --> 20:45.326
What we're about to have here
is a dead fat guy on a stick!

20:46.245 --> 20:49.121
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
let's poke.

20:49.456 --> 20:52.250
Steady.

20:52.417 --> 20:54.335
Okay, a little higher.

20:54.628 --> 20:56.212
Careful of the angle.

20:56.380 --> 20:59.131
Okay, okay.
We're approaching the window.

21:03.011 --> 21:05.513
Thread the needle. Thread the needle.

21:11.186 --> 21:13.896
He's alive! He's alive!

21:15.983 --> 21:18.401
And yet we're still poking him.

21:18.568 --> 21:21.237
Okay, retract the device!
Retract the device!

21:21.738 --> 21:24.615
- He does not look happy.
- Hey, hey.

21:24.783 --> 21:27.785
Now he's showing us his poking device.

21:28.787 --> 21:33.332
Hey, that's never gonna make it
all the way over here, buddy! Ha.

21:38.547 --> 21:43.843
I'll hold you close in my arms

21:44.469 --> 21:49.098
I can't resist your charms

21:49.641 --> 21:51.392
And love

21:51.560 --> 21:53.894
Love

21:54.730 --> 21:59.817
I'll be a fool for you

21:59.985 --> 22:02.820
I'm sure

22:03.405 --> 22:06.615
You know I don't mind

22:06.783 --> 22:09.493
Oh, you know I don't mind

22:09.661 --> 22:11.829
Yes

22:11.997 --> 22:16.542
You mean the world to me

22:16.710 --> 22:19.920
- Oh, I know
- I know

22:20.088 --> 22:22.840
- I've found
- I've found

22:23.008 --> 22:25.259
In you

22:25.719 --> 22:35.728
My endless love

22:37.564 --> 22:39.398
Love

22:39.566 --> 22:42.693
- Lo... Love
- Love
