WEBVTT

00:05.153 --> 00:07.588
You got everything
out of your cell?

00:07.656 --> 00:09.724
Yeah, yeah.

00:09.791 --> 00:11.258
Hey, you finally made bail.
Huh, kid?

00:11.326 --> 00:13.828
Yeah. Thought I'd never
get out of this hell hole.

00:13.895 --> 00:16.062
Here, fill out and sign your
inventory and property receipt,

00:16.131 --> 00:18.032
then you can change your clothes in
the bathroom down the hall on the left.

00:18.100 --> 00:20.634
Hey. Don't let me see you
in here again.

00:20.702 --> 00:21.836
You won't.

00:21.903 --> 00:23.871
All right.

"Your own personal
sleep coach"?

01:22.297 --> 01:24.799
Why does Jane need
a sleep coach,

01:24.866 --> 01:27.134
and what's a "zq"?

01:27.202 --> 01:29.770
Oh, this machine
measures R.E.M....

01:29.838 --> 01:31.038
Rapid Eye Movement.

01:31.106 --> 01:33.774
See, you just wear this
while you sleep,

01:33.842 --> 01:37.111
and it calculates
your sleep cycles.

01:37.179 --> 01:38.913
She'll never get married.
Send it back.

01:38.980 --> 01:40.648
Oh.

01:40.715 --> 01:42.883
Okay.

01:42.951 --> 01:45.052
Then what am I gonna get her
for her birthday?

01:45.120 --> 01:47.154
Oprah says you should give
to charity.

01:47.222 --> 01:48.722
That's a good idea.

01:48.790 --> 01:50.191
Yeah, but it's not much
of a gift

01:50.258 --> 01:52.259
unless you give Jane
the tax deduction.

01:52.327 --> 01:54.261
Oh.

01:54.329 --> 01:57.798
Listen, I'm gonna go
to the party store.

01:57.866 --> 01:59.800
We're gonna have
a surprise party.

01:59.868 --> 02:02.203
And I am gonna celebrate
even if Jane doesn't like it.

02:02.270 --> 02:04.705
Good luck with that.
You know she hates surprises.

02:04.773 --> 02:05.840
Hi. Come in.

02:08.143 --> 02:12.246
Um, I'm sorry. Uh,
what are you doing down here?

02:12.314 --> 02:15.082
Oh, I'm assisting Frankie
with his anxiety.

02:15.150 --> 02:18.953
Sweetheart,
why are you anxious?

02:19.020 --> 02:21.622
- Is it because you put on a little weight?
- What?

02:21.690 --> 02:25.125
No! Ma... I didn't...
I didn't put on any weight.

02:25.193 --> 02:27.661
It's muscle, so...

02:27.729 --> 02:29.864
If you say so.

02:29.931 --> 02:31.365
- Can you go?
- Mm-hmm.

02:31.433 --> 02:33.834
I-I'm having
my detectives exam today,

02:33.902 --> 02:36.737
and Dr. Isles is giving me
some relaxation tips.

02:36.805 --> 02:37.905
Oh.

02:37.973 --> 02:39.840
Good luck, honey.

02:41.042 --> 02:42.843
I'm gonna fail.

02:42.911 --> 02:44.178
No, you're not.

02:44.246 --> 02:45.679
I have been reading
the Mayo Clinic research

02:45.747 --> 02:48.182
on treating anxiety
through hypnosis.

02:48.250 --> 02:50.217
Sit down.

02:50.285 --> 02:52.219
Okay.

02:52.287 --> 02:54.655
Now, close your eyes.

02:54.723 --> 02:56.123
You two should at least
close the blinds.

02:56.191 --> 02:59.059
- That's a very good idea.
- It's not what you think.

02:59.127 --> 03:00.961
I know.
I just bumped into ma.

03:01.029 --> 03:03.097
You better kill on that exam
today, little brother.

03:03.164 --> 03:04.431
There's nothing like
a little more pressure.

03:04.499 --> 03:06.100
Come on.

03:06.167 --> 03:07.835
There's been a stabbing
at the Brimmer Street Jail.

03:07.903 --> 03:09.737
Victim probably won't survive
his wounds. Let's go.

03:10.839 --> 03:13.173
No, that's okay. I didn't
want to be a detective anyway.

03:13.241 --> 03:14.742
Then why is he taking
the exam?

03:16.912 --> 03:18.846
That's sarcasm.

03:18.914 --> 03:21.315
Using irony to convey contempt?

03:21.383 --> 03:23.150
Are you trying
to drive me crazy?

03:23.218 --> 03:25.019
No!

03:26.788 --> 03:29.890
Well, what did I say?

03:32.127 --> 03:33.761
Whoa, whoa.

03:33.828 --> 03:36.196
Boston homicide. We've been
called in by the warden.

03:36.264 --> 03:38.065
Yeah, I know. Warden Price
will be here in a second.

03:38.133 --> 03:39.266
Take off your shoes
and your jacket.

03:39.334 --> 03:40.534
Give me your bags.

03:43.238 --> 03:45.472
We need to get

03:45.540 --> 03:47.207
into the infirmary
and talk to the victim.

03:47.275 --> 03:49.343
You need to go through
full security, detective.

03:49.411 --> 03:51.345
This is bullshit.

03:51.413 --> 03:53.347
They're very thorough here.

03:53.415 --> 03:55.115
Reminds me of when I flew
to Tel Aviv.

03:55.183 --> 03:57.418
Price used to be
a big-time defense attorney.

03:57.485 --> 04:00.120
Before he used
his juice to get this job...

04:00.188 --> 04:01.355
Korsak and I went up

04:01.423 --> 04:02.890
against him
in a few murder trials.

04:02.958 --> 04:05.426
We beat he every time.
He hates us.

04:05.493 --> 04:09.063
Oh.

04:10.131 --> 04:11.432
She needs a pat-down.

04:11.499 --> 04:13.300
Oh, come on. She's
the Chief Medical Examiner.

04:13.368 --> 04:15.202
Turn around.

04:15.270 --> 04:16.870
Spread your legs.

04:18.873 --> 04:22.142
Well, I couldn't possibly
hide anything -- up there!

04:22.210 --> 04:24.144
Surrender your weapon.

04:24.212 --> 04:25.779
I know the drill.

04:25.847 --> 04:28.082
You making this personal
only wastes precious time.

04:28.149 --> 04:29.883
This isn't personal, detective.

04:34.356 --> 04:35.956
Warden Price.

04:39.961 --> 04:41.762
Okay.

04:41.830 --> 04:44.765
Stabbing victim
was just pronounced.

04:44.833 --> 04:46.533
Great... thanks for hurrying
so we could talk to him

04:46.601 --> 04:48.135
before he died.

04:53.908 --> 04:55.242
You knew him?

04:55.310 --> 04:59.079
Yeah. His name's Graham Randall.
He was only 22.

04:59.147 --> 05:01.081
I just processed him.
He made bail this morning.

05:01.149 --> 05:02.349
Poor kid.

05:04.085 --> 05:06.186
- And how long was he here?
- Three weeks.

05:06.254 --> 05:08.222
On what charge?

05:08.289 --> 05:09.923
94C-34.

05:09.991 --> 05:12.092
Possession of class "B" cocaine.
That's a misdemeanor.

05:12.160 --> 05:15.963
He was being held here until
he made the $5,000 bail.

05:16.031 --> 05:17.898
Looks like it cost him
his life.

05:17.966 --> 05:20.000
This is about three liters
of blood.

05:20.068 --> 05:23.003
Well, I'm surprised he made it
to the infirmary.

05:23.071 --> 05:24.271
Only because he was young
and healthy.

05:25.507 --> 05:26.974
All right.

05:27.042 --> 05:29.076
So, no camera in here?

05:29.144 --> 05:30.377
We don't have them
in the release areas.

05:30.445 --> 05:31.545
Well, you might
want to re-think that.

05:31.613 --> 05:33.013
I'll need Graham's records.

05:33.081 --> 05:34.915
Once I see the
appropriate subpoena.

05:34.983 --> 05:36.917
You're really gonna make it harder
for us to find this kid's killer?

05:36.985 --> 05:38.285
Because whether
you like it or not,

05:38.353 --> 05:39.520
you're on our side
now, counselor.

05:39.587 --> 05:42.189
You seem a little hysterical.

05:42.257 --> 05:43.891
Did you really just say...

05:43.958 --> 05:45.826
Did he really just say that?

05:45.894 --> 05:48.829
Jane, why don't we go
take a look at the body?

05:48.897 --> 05:52.533
It's a good thing
my gun is locked up. God!

05:56.071 --> 05:59.339
When did you start patting down
police officers, Price?

05:59.407 --> 06:02.576
It's standard for
mid-level-security jails.

06:02.644 --> 06:04.211
Yeah, in Kabul.

06:04.279 --> 06:07.514
Korsak, will you come with me
to view the body?

06:07.582 --> 06:09.216
Frost, can you start working
on getting subpoenas?

06:09.284 --> 06:11.351
- Price being a dick?
- Yes.

06:11.419 --> 06:15.222
He called me "hysterical."

06:15.290 --> 06:17.024
I'm surprised his balls
aren't in his throat right now.

06:17.092 --> 06:19.126
No kidding.

06:19.194 --> 06:22.296
He bled out.

06:22.363 --> 06:25.432
Two stab wounds to each
of his kidneys.

06:25.500 --> 06:26.934
Ouch.

06:27.001 --> 06:28.435
It's an excruciating way
to die.

06:28.503 --> 06:30.170
Yeah, but quick.
All you need is a shiv.

06:30.238 --> 06:31.572
They practically teach it
in here.

06:31.639 --> 06:33.440
Any idea what the shiv
was made of?

06:33.508 --> 06:36.176
No. Looks more like
puncture wounds.

06:36.244 --> 06:38.879
The edges are
surprisingly clean.

06:38.947 --> 06:41.248
Something very sharp.

06:41.316 --> 06:42.616
Like Jane.

06:52.427 --> 06:53.427
What the hell?

06:58.700 --> 07:02.069
Do your hands hurt, Jane?

07:04.205 --> 07:07.341
No. It's like
it never happened.

07:07.408 --> 07:09.610
Well, as long as you're here,
come closer.

07:11.379 --> 07:14.014
I have so much
to tell you, Jane...

07:14.082 --> 07:17.384
And so little time.

07:22.092 --> 07:25.837
- What's he doing in a jail Infirmary?
- He killed nine people, Price!

07:25.905 --> 07:28.443
He's supposed to be
in a maximum-security unit!

07:28.489 --> 07:30.022
He's receiving treatment
for cancer

07:30.090 --> 07:31.424
at Boston General's
oncology unit.

07:31.492 --> 07:33.426
You're moving him
back and forth?!

07:33.494 --> 07:36.562
Even prisoners are entitled
to medical care, detective.

07:36.630 --> 07:39.031
You know he escaped before...
by faking appendicitis!

07:39.099 --> 07:41.267
You think I'm faking cancer?

07:46.150 --> 07:48.284
Do you want to see
what I'm reading?

07:50.655 --> 07:52.155
I love murder mysteries.
Don't you?

07:52.223 --> 07:53.256
Oh, shut up!

07:55.126 --> 07:56.393
I want to see
his medical records.

07:56.460 --> 07:57.727
Jane is right ...

07:57.795 --> 07:59.062
he went to medical school.
He could be faking.

07:59.130 --> 08:00.230
Not without his permission.

08:03.334 --> 08:04.601
You're gonna sign a form
that lets us look

08:04.669 --> 08:06.169
at your medical records,
you piece of crap.

08:06.237 --> 08:08.171
Now, Jane...

08:08.239 --> 08:10.173
You know that's too private,

08:10.241 --> 08:11.775
even between us.

08:14.512 --> 08:17.747
- Come closer.
- Oh, son of a bitch.

08:17.815 --> 08:20.483
Don't you want to hear
something very interesting?

08:21.652 --> 08:24.854
Something very,
very bad that I did?

08:27.692 --> 08:29.726
You wouldn't want me to die
before I told you,

08:29.794 --> 08:31.194
now, would you, Jane?

08:31.262 --> 08:33.196
Don't get sucked in, Jane.

08:33.264 --> 08:35.698
Nobody knows, Jane...
Nobody knows,

08:35.765 --> 08:37.500
but I'll tell you.

08:37.568 --> 08:41.136
And the good doctor
can hear, too.

08:41.205 --> 08:44.808
But the fat cop...
Get him out of here.

08:46.544 --> 08:47.877
Korsak...

08:49.380 --> 08:51.247
Wait for me outside.

08:51.315 --> 08:52.615
Please.

08:58.723 --> 09:02.192
Tape this.

09:02.259 --> 09:04.160
Talk.

09:04.228 --> 09:07.797
You have my attention
for 30 seconds.

09:07.865 --> 09:11.201
Do you remember where you were
in the fall of '05?

09:11.268 --> 09:13.436
No.

09:13.504 --> 09:17.574
The leaves were beautiful.

09:17.641 --> 09:22.545
Even the weeping willows
turned yellow that year.

09:22.613 --> 09:24.247
You said that you did something
very bad.

09:24.315 --> 09:26.316
Did you murder someone
in the fall of '05?

09:26.383 --> 09:28.885
I love the feel of velvet.

09:28.953 --> 09:35.258
Virgin white velvet.

09:35.326 --> 09:39.129
A young eagle lost
its family of four.

09:39.196 --> 09:43.133
Did you know
that eagles don't drink water?

09:43.200 --> 09:45.335
I'll bet you did,
Dr. Isles.

09:47.671 --> 09:49.305
Did you come
through the west gate?

09:52.910 --> 09:56.212
It is possible that the cancer

09:56.280 --> 09:58.281
has metastasized
into his brain.

09:58.349 --> 09:59.783
You don't think he knows
what he's talking about?

10:01.252 --> 10:02.352
I don't know, Maura.

10:02.419 --> 10:04.587
I'm just saying it's possible.

10:07.391 --> 10:09.659
I'm glad you're dying.

10:09.727 --> 10:14.397
It's something very bad
that I did, Jane.

10:14.465 --> 10:15.932
So do one good thing
with your life

10:16.000 --> 10:17.767
and if you're gonna confess
to something,

10:17.835 --> 10:19.936
do it straight up so I can
bring a family some peace.

10:20.004 --> 10:22.005
I'm not looking for peace.
Mnh-mnh.

10:25.242 --> 10:28.878
And I'm bored talking with you.

10:37.621 --> 10:40.557
Are you okay?

10:40.624 --> 10:42.725
Why, because I saw my own
personal boogeyman today?

10:42.793 --> 10:44.327
No.

10:44.395 --> 10:46.663
God -- I'm gonna have nightmares
for months!

10:46.730 --> 10:48.431
Really?

10:48.499 --> 10:50.633
Do you think you might need
your own personal sleep coach?

10:50.701 --> 10:52.168
What?

10:52.236 --> 10:53.703
It's a good thing
they didn't search us

10:53.771 --> 10:55.505
on the way out.

10:55.573 --> 10:57.006
Maura, what are you doing?

10:58.642 --> 11:00.443
You stole a vial
of Hoyt's blood?

11:00.511 --> 11:02.779
Well... technically,
sort of.

11:02.847 --> 11:05.281
Gosh, I guess it is stealing.

11:05.349 --> 11:07.383
If he files charges,
I'll be your character witness.

11:07.451 --> 11:09.252
- I don't want to get arrested!
- You're not gonna get arrested.

11:09.320 --> 11:10.587
Take it to the crime lab.

11:10.654 --> 11:12.655
I only need enough to do
a staining,

11:12.723 --> 11:14.891
just to see if cancer cells
are present.

11:14.959 --> 11:17.760
Great. "Scientific Inquiry."
Not stealing. Let's go.

11:17.828 --> 11:19.762
You're sure?

11:19.830 --> 11:21.464
Yes, I'm positive.

11:21.532 --> 11:23.333
And e-mail me the video
you took with the phone, okay?

11:23.400 --> 11:24.601
Okay.

11:24.668 --> 11:25.802
Jane!

11:25.870 --> 11:27.704
Yeah!

11:27.771 --> 11:29.539
Got Graham's Bureau
of Probation records.

11:29.607 --> 11:30.807
All of his
personal belongings, too.

11:30.875 --> 11:32.809
Price can't say no
to a subpoena.

11:32.877 --> 11:35.612
And we recovered three shivs
from separate cells.

11:35.679 --> 11:36.946
Nice,
let's take them to Maura...

11:37.014 --> 11:38.581
See if one of them
is the murder weapon.

11:40.484 --> 11:44.587
Okay, why is there a torts
law book in his things?

11:44.655 --> 11:46.956
He was in for three weeks.

11:47.024 --> 11:49.692
How'd he plan to be
a jailhouse lawyer?

11:49.760 --> 11:51.761
Well, he worked in the library.
Maybe he read everything else.

11:51.829 --> 11:54.631
Did you find anything
in his file?

11:54.698 --> 11:57.033
College graduate.
No priors.

11:57.101 --> 11:58.534
He ran a red light,

11:58.602 --> 12:00.336
got caught with a couple grams
of cocaine.

12:00.404 --> 12:01.938
So who'd he piss off in jail?

12:02.006 --> 12:04.607
Maura, did you find a shiv
to match his wounds?

12:04.675 --> 12:06.609
Well...

12:06.677 --> 12:10.380
this is a sharpened
prison toothbrush.

12:10.447 --> 12:12.582
Notice the knitted handle.

12:12.650 --> 12:14.017
Mm. There's a new take
on an old favorite.

12:14.084 --> 12:15.418
Was that the murder weapon?

12:15.486 --> 12:16.986
No.

12:18.989 --> 12:20.590
This one appears
to have been made

12:20.658 --> 12:22.325
with a straightened
chain-link fence.

12:22.393 --> 12:23.660
Hmm. Was that it?

12:23.727 --> 12:26.562
No.

12:26.630 --> 12:27.964
This is a ballpoint pen

12:28.032 --> 12:30.400
embedded with
a disposable razor.

12:30.467 --> 12:31.935
Was that the murder weapon?

12:32.002 --> 12:33.403
Definitely not.

12:33.470 --> 12:34.938
Okay, what's with
the show-and-tell?

12:35.005 --> 12:37.640
I just think it's so
interesting, don't you?

12:37.708 --> 12:39.809
It's a little like
"Project Runway."

12:41.812 --> 12:44.380
You know, they --
they move into the jail,

12:44.448 --> 12:45.715
they get the same items,

12:45.783 --> 12:48.551
but they all fashion
different homemade shivs.

12:48.619 --> 12:51.521
Really?

12:51.588 --> 12:54.057
Well, I think it's interesting.

12:56.527 --> 12:59.028
You weren't even gonna tell me?

12:59.096 --> 13:00.730
About what?

13:00.798 --> 13:02.065
About Hoyt!

13:02.132 --> 13:03.633
Shh!

13:03.701 --> 13:04.968
I don't want ma to hear...
she'll flip out.

13:05.035 --> 13:06.602
Hi, there, you two!

13:06.670 --> 13:08.905
- Hey, ma.
- Hey, ma.

13:08.973 --> 13:11.674
Someone's gonna tell her.
It's all over headquarters.

13:11.742 --> 13:13.009
We'll give her something bigger
to think about

13:13.077 --> 13:14.410
so she doesn't have time
to gossip.

13:14.478 --> 13:15.578
Like what?

13:15.646 --> 13:17.113
Like...

13:17.181 --> 13:18.915
I know she's throwing me
a surprise party.

13:18.983 --> 13:21.084
No, she's not.

13:21.151 --> 13:24.620
Tell her I want
a "My Pretty Pony" party.

13:24.688 --> 13:26.622
"My Pretty Pony"?

13:26.690 --> 13:28.791
So, you're turning 9 again?

13:28.859 --> 13:30.493
They've been discontinued.

13:30.561 --> 13:33.563
She'll drive all over town
looking for pony party supplies.

13:33.630 --> 13:36.699
Okay.

13:36.767 --> 13:38.701
No, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait! I forgot. I'm sorry.

13:38.769 --> 13:39.936
How'd you do on the exam?

13:40.004 --> 13:42.105
Terrible. I bombed.

13:42.172 --> 13:44.474
No, you didn't. All right?
Everybody thinks they bombed.

13:44.541 --> 13:45.641
I thought I bombed.

13:45.709 --> 13:47.010
Yeah, well, I did.

13:47.077 --> 13:49.512
I'm gonna be on patrol
for the rest of my life.

13:49.580 --> 13:50.813
No, you're not.
Come on.

13:50.881 --> 13:52.548
Hey, what's the matter
with you two?

13:52.616 --> 13:53.883
You look like you lost
your favorite pair of mittens.

13:53.951 --> 13:56.686
Mittens? Really?
Ma.

13:56.754 --> 13:58.554
How about a cream cheese
and jelly sandwich?

13:58.622 --> 13:59.822
That'll make you feel better.

13:59.890 --> 14:01.691
No.

14:01.759 --> 14:03.026
No, thanks, ma.

14:03.093 --> 14:04.560
Come on. Hey...

14:04.628 --> 14:05.928
Whoa. Don't have to
take it out on her.

14:05.930 --> 14:07.730
She told me I looked fat.

14:07.798 --> 14:09.866
I said you put on
muscle weight!

14:09.867 --> 14:11.768
No, she didn't.

14:11.835 --> 14:13.703
You do look kind of chunky.

14:13.771 --> 14:15.405
Shut up.

14:15.472 --> 14:17.907
Ow!
Nice muscles.

14:17.975 --> 14:19.675
Ow.

14:22.980 --> 14:26.916
<i>Do you remember where you were
in the fall of '05?</i>

14:26.984 --> 14:31.054
He says something about eagles
like right... here.

14:31.121 --> 14:34.924
<i>A young eagle lost its family
of four.</i>

14:34.992 --> 14:37.727
<i>Did you know that eagles
don't drink water?</i>

14:37.795 --> 14:39.562
- Why eagles?
- Why are you doing that now?

14:39.630 --> 14:41.397
Yeah,
that's a good question.

14:41.465 --> 14:44.667
I just got off the phone
with Warden Price.

14:44.735 --> 14:46.903
Sean, you know he's posturing
because he's gonna run for office.

14:46.970 --> 14:49.572
Yeah, yeah, he's an asshole.
But he had a point.

14:49.640 --> 14:51.441
Rizzoli, you're supposed to be
solving an inmate's murder,

14:51.508 --> 14:54.110
not listening to
some crackpot serial killer...

14:54.178 --> 14:55.845
With all due respect
for what you went through.

14:55.913 --> 14:58.047
I'm sorry.
I have been working the case.

14:58.115 --> 14:59.582
Yeah? Which case?

14:59.650 --> 15:01.150
Graham Randall's mother
is here.

15:04.054 --> 15:07.690
How about you tell me who
killed that kid, Rizzoli. Hmm?

15:09.026 --> 15:10.827
Korsak...

15:10.894 --> 15:12.128
Can you take this with Frost?

15:12.196 --> 15:13.729
Maura just found something
in the body.

15:13.797 --> 15:15.131
Sure.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.569
I couldn't get
the bail money together.

15:19.636 --> 15:22.071
$5,000 was just too much
for me to raise.

15:22.139 --> 15:24.073
But Graham said he was okay.

15:24.141 --> 15:26.075
When did you last talk to him?

15:26.143 --> 15:27.610
He called me yesterday.

15:27.678 --> 15:29.579
Graham said an angel
would be coming by

15:29.646 --> 15:30.980
with his bail.

15:31.048 --> 15:32.982
An "angel"
paid your son's bail?

15:33.050 --> 15:34.550
Who?

15:34.618 --> 15:36.018
He said he was a lawyer.

15:36.086 --> 15:37.620
He showed up at my door

15:37.688 --> 15:39.856
about an hour
after Graham called

15:39.923 --> 15:41.991
with an envelope full of money.

15:42.059 --> 15:43.926
That strike you as odd...
a stranger just showing up,

15:43.994 --> 15:45.261
giving you that much cash?

15:45.329 --> 15:46.996
I didn't care
where it came from.

15:47.064 --> 15:48.965
I just knew my prayers
had been answered.

15:49.032 --> 15:50.633
I could get my son out of jail.

15:50.701 --> 15:53.503
Do you know why Graham...

15:53.570 --> 15:55.204
had a law book with him?

15:57.808 --> 16:02.078
He was going back
to Boston College.

16:02.146 --> 16:05.181
He had been accepted
to the law school.

16:07.251 --> 16:11.020
And I thought everything
was finally gonna be okay.

16:13.924 --> 16:17.026
Hey.

16:17.094 --> 16:18.728
Hey.

16:18.795 --> 16:22.031
I may have found
a bowel obstruction.

16:22.099 --> 16:24.200
Hold your breath.
This will smell.

16:24.268 --> 16:25.835
Come on, Maura...

16:25.903 --> 16:27.537
I don't need to see...
or smell... this.

16:27.604 --> 16:29.272
Oh, my God.

16:29.339 --> 16:31.140
What?

16:31.208 --> 16:33.809
He swallowed something.

16:33.877 --> 16:35.211
What is it? Dope?

16:36.713 --> 16:39.048
Let's see.

16:46.623 --> 16:49.692
No. Teeth.

16:50.661 --> 16:52.828
What the hell?

16:54.231 --> 16:56.165
From different people.

16:58.955 --> 17:02.981
- How many different people?
- Four different people.

17:03.049 --> 17:06.017
These two are both number 8s,

17:06.085 --> 17:08.185
adult incisors, and
the other two are number 29s,

17:08.253 --> 17:09.721
pre-molar bicuspids.

17:09.789 --> 17:11.222
They're primary teeth, Jane.

17:11.290 --> 17:12.757
- You mean from children?
- Yeah.

17:12.825 --> 17:15.660
They were all removed
perimortem.

17:15.728 --> 17:17.796
Before they died.

17:17.863 --> 17:20.031
Graham Randall was a mule,

17:20.098 --> 17:22.901
smuggling out a balloon
full of human teeth...

17:22.969 --> 17:25.103
This doesn't make any sense.

17:25.171 --> 17:26.738
I've never seen
anything like this.

17:26.806 --> 17:28.106
I'll do DNA testing
on each one.

17:29.875 --> 17:32.377
Okay, they could hear that
on the fourth floor.

17:32.445 --> 17:34.112
Well, I turned up the audio

17:34.180 --> 17:36.381
so that I could hear Hoyt's
blood results when they came in.

17:40.019 --> 17:42.120
Uh, oops.

17:42.188 --> 17:43.655
A hot-air balloon ride?

17:43.723 --> 17:46.124
Well, it's a rather
unfortunate coincidence

17:46.192 --> 17:48.994
that I just found a balloon full
of teeth today,

17:49.061 --> 17:51.062
but this is
completely different.

17:51.130 --> 17:53.264
I had zero interest in a balloon
ride before the teeth.

17:53.332 --> 17:55.233
Well, then, what am I gonna
get you for your birthday?

17:57.336 --> 17:59.371
What is that,
the duck boat ride?

17:59.438 --> 18:01.873
No. That's Hoyt's
blood results.

18:01.941 --> 18:03.775
He has cancer.

18:03.843 --> 18:06.811
Pancreatic. Stage IV.
He's definitely dying.

18:06.879 --> 18:10.148
Okay, well, that's the only
birthday present I need.

18:11.884 --> 18:14.119
Teeth.

18:14.186 --> 18:16.287
Yeah.

18:16.355 --> 18:18.656
Four of them.

18:18.724 --> 18:22.160
Maura found them
in Graham's intestines.

18:22.228 --> 18:24.129
He swallowed them.
Question is, why?

18:24.196 --> 18:25.263
You can get anything in
and out of prisons.

18:25.331 --> 18:27.732
But who smuggles out teeth?

18:27.800 --> 18:28.900
Yeah, this is a weird one.

18:28.968 --> 18:31.936
Okay, stranger
bails out our victim

18:32.004 --> 18:34.105
a few hours before
he's stabbed to death.

18:34.173 --> 18:35.807
Mother said he had a law book

18:35.875 --> 18:37.809
because he was going to
law school at Boston College.

18:37.877 --> 18:38.810
Korsak...

18:38.878 --> 18:41.179
B.C.'s mascot
is an eagle.

18:42.214 --> 18:43.314
So?

18:43.382 --> 18:45.917
So, that's the connection
to Hoyt.

18:45.985 --> 18:47.419
He was just playing me.

18:47.486 --> 18:49.287
"Where were you
in the fall of '05"?

18:49.355 --> 18:50.822
Maybe that's where
we should be looking.

18:50.890 --> 18:52.824
At cold cases?
You heard Cavanaugh

18:52.892 --> 18:54.025
solve this kid's murder.

18:54.093 --> 18:55.827
Hoyt's involved.

18:55.895 --> 18:58.963
Did you find anything that put
Graham anywhere near Hoyt?

18:59.031 --> 19:00.899
Maybe his library runs,

19:00.966 --> 19:03.168
but the prison
doesn't keep any records.

19:03.235 --> 19:04.936
Jane, Hoyt is dying of cancer.

19:05.004 --> 19:06.471
He didn't stab Graham Randall.

19:06.539 --> 19:08.239
Yeah, but maybe he had
somebody else do it.

19:08.307 --> 19:09.741
He's already had
two apprentices,

19:09.809 --> 19:11.042
made them kill for him.

19:11.110 --> 19:12.777
You think Graham
was Hoyt's apprentice?

19:12.845 --> 19:14.112
I don't know.

19:17.416 --> 19:19.217
Frost, stay here.

19:19.285 --> 19:21.786
Just call me if Cavanaugh
comes looking for us.

19:21.854 --> 19:23.121
Who's "us"?

19:23.189 --> 19:24.889
You and me.

19:24.957 --> 19:26.191
Where are "we" going?

19:26.258 --> 19:28.827
To the basement,
to look at cold cases.

19:30.496 --> 19:32.297
You're going?

19:32.364 --> 19:34.165
You know how persuasive
she can be.

19:34.233 --> 19:36.901
- Korsak!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:40.139 --> 19:42.240
You think this is a wild-goose
chase, don't you?

19:42.308 --> 19:44.776
Hey, I'm here, okay?

19:44.844 --> 19:49.147
If there's something to find,
we'll find it.

19:50.983 --> 19:53.318
Thanks, Korsak.

19:56.922 --> 19:58.923
Hey...

19:58.991 --> 20:01.059
I know what you went through.

20:01.127 --> 20:02.961
What we went through.

20:11.137 --> 20:14.239
Nothing.

20:14.306 --> 20:17.108
We've been through
every unsolved murder

20:17.176 --> 20:19.277
from 2004 to 2006.

20:19.345 --> 20:21.980
Let's call it a night, Jane.

20:22.047 --> 20:24.149
You go. I'm gonna stay.

20:24.216 --> 20:25.316
Jane...

20:25.384 --> 20:27.852
- There's something here!
- No.

20:27.920 --> 20:28.953
There isn't.

20:31.490 --> 20:33.324
Go home.
Get some sleep.

20:33.392 --> 20:36.394
We'll tackle Graham's murder
in the morning.

20:38.364 --> 20:40.899
Good night.

20:55.514 --> 20:58.349
You think
she's still downstairs?

20:58.417 --> 20:59.784
I'll go check.

20:59.852 --> 21:03.121
I found it!
I found it.

21:03.189 --> 21:04.455
Okay, Hoyt said,

21:04.523 --> 21:06.991
"A young eagle
had lost its family."

21:07.059 --> 21:08.459
"Lost."

21:08.527 --> 21:10.995
That's why we
couldn't find anything.

21:11.063 --> 21:12.997
So I finally went
to missing persons.

21:13.065 --> 21:14.199
And found a missing family
of four from the fall of '05.

21:14.266 --> 21:16.901
Oh, my God, Jane.

21:16.969 --> 21:19.003
The Wilson family...
Father, mother, two daughters.

21:19.071 --> 21:20.205
Mm-hmm. And a son.

21:20.272 --> 21:21.539
Family dropped him off
at college

21:21.607 --> 21:23.074
and were never
heard from again.

21:23.142 --> 21:24.576
This is friggin' tragic...

21:24.643 --> 21:27.045
Son was the only suspect
in their disappearance.

21:27.112 --> 21:29.280
About to start his first
semester at Boston College.

21:29.348 --> 21:31.182
Yeah, the same college where
our victim, Graham Randall,

21:31.250 --> 21:32.450
was headed to this fall.

21:32.518 --> 21:33.985
I want to go back
and talk to Hoyt.

21:34.053 --> 21:35.386
Cavanaugh gave us
our marching orders...

21:35.454 --> 21:36.921
Work on Graham,
stay away from Hoyt.

21:36.989 --> 21:38.256
We need more.

21:38.324 --> 21:40.425
Okay.

21:40.492 --> 21:43.494
Dr. Wilson was a Professor
at the Emory School of Medicine,

21:43.562 --> 21:45.563
same medical school
that Hoyt went to.

21:45.631 --> 21:47.198
That's another connection
to Hoyt.

21:47.266 --> 21:49.467
Do we even know that Hoyt
was in Boston in '05?

21:49.535 --> 21:51.536
Frost, check with
the B.C. Campus Police.

21:51.604 --> 21:54.272
See if Hoyt had any connection
to that college in 2005.

21:54.340 --> 21:56.140
The thing is,
it's all speculation

21:56.208 --> 21:58.543
unless we can link those teeth
to the Wilsons' DNA.

21:58.611 --> 22:01.045
Yeah, well, we find the son,
we compare his DNA.

22:01.113 --> 22:03.381
Can you find a driver's license
for Jacob Wilson?

22:03.449 --> 22:04.482
Yeah.

22:07.386 --> 22:09.153
That was easy.

22:09.221 --> 22:12.557
He still lives in Boston.

22:12.625 --> 22:14.125
A cheek swab from Jacob
will tell us

22:14.193 --> 22:15.293
whether the teeth that
Graham smuggled out of jail

22:15.361 --> 22:16.894
belong to the Wilsons.

22:16.962 --> 22:18.896
Yeah, and if they do,
then both these cases

22:18.964 --> 22:20.698
got "Hoyt" written
all over them.

22:22.167 --> 22:24.602
I'm sorry. Thank you.

22:24.670 --> 22:26.437
It's okay.

22:26.505 --> 22:27.939
I'm used to being
interrogated by the police.

22:28.007 --> 22:29.040
First time you wanted
my DNA, though.

22:29.108 --> 22:30.541
Why now?

22:30.609 --> 22:33.111
We, uh, have found
some new evidence

22:33.178 --> 22:35.246
that could help us
solve this case.

22:35.314 --> 22:37.248
What evidence?

22:37.316 --> 22:38.516
We can't say.

22:38.584 --> 22:39.651
This is your family?

22:39.718 --> 22:41.085
Yeah.

22:41.153 --> 22:43.154
This is the last time
I saw them.

22:43.222 --> 22:44.989
My new roommate
took that picture.

22:46.558 --> 22:49.527
The youngest girl is in
a white velvet headband.

22:51.297 --> 22:54.666
Hoyt said that he loved
the feel of white velvet.

22:54.733 --> 22:57.368
How fast can you
check the DNA?

22:57.436 --> 22:59.304
I'll push it right through.

23:01.373 --> 23:03.007
I thought about lying,

23:03.075 --> 23:05.410
saying I had something to do
with the disappearance,

23:05.477 --> 23:08.246
just to get you guys
to look for them.

23:08.314 --> 23:10.315
We know you didn't have anything
to do with this.

23:10.382 --> 23:12.617
You do?

23:15.587 --> 23:17.055
We need you to tell us

23:17.122 --> 23:18.990
about the last day
you saw your family.

23:19.058 --> 23:21.326
Um...

23:21.393 --> 23:25.396
I, uh-- was about
to start college...

23:25.464 --> 23:27.165
Talk us through that day,
everything you can remember.

23:27.232 --> 23:30.702
We went to the family
pancake breakfast,

23:30.769 --> 23:33.137
then a campus blood drive.

23:33.205 --> 23:36.240
My dad was big
on donating blood.

23:36.308 --> 23:41.112
Then they took me back
to my dorm room.

23:41.180 --> 23:43.348
And they said goodbye.

23:43.415 --> 23:44.716
Do the Westgate Woods
near the B.C. campus

23:44.783 --> 23:46.451
mean anything to you?

23:46.518 --> 23:49.120
Yeah. My mom and dad met there.
They both went to B.C.

23:49.188 --> 23:50.288
Got something.

23:50.356 --> 23:53.558
Excuse me.

23:53.625 --> 23:57.395
Hoyt was in Boston in '05.

23:57.463 --> 23:59.097
B.C. Police went through
their security log.

23:59.164 --> 24:01.132
Hoyt was working
as a phlebotomist

24:01.200 --> 24:02.633
for a mobile blood drive.

24:02.701 --> 24:06.003
Nice work, Frost.

24:06.071 --> 24:09.006
Jacob...

24:09.074 --> 24:11.008
Does this man
look familiar to you?

24:13.345 --> 24:16.114
Maybe. I don't know.

24:16.181 --> 24:17.415
Dig into your memory.

24:17.483 --> 24:20.251
Anything unusual happen
at that blood drive?

24:20.319 --> 24:23.421
The only thing that seemed weird
was my dad talked to the guy

24:23.489 --> 24:25.289
who drew his blood for a while.

24:25.357 --> 24:26.624
Did he say
what they talked about?

24:26.692 --> 24:28.025
The guy was one
of his students.

24:28.093 --> 24:29.527
Could this be the man

24:29.595 --> 24:32.230
that your father recognized
as a student

24:32.297 --> 24:34.098
that he taught
in medical school?

24:34.166 --> 24:36.267
Maybe. Yeah.

24:36.335 --> 24:37.735
My dad was surprised

24:37.803 --> 24:40.538
the guy ended up
in a dead-end job.

24:40.606 --> 24:43.674
Okay.
Thank you, Jack.

24:43.742 --> 24:45.576
Please...

24:45.644 --> 24:47.445
I know they're dead.

24:47.513 --> 24:49.380
Did he do it?

24:49.448 --> 24:52.617
I just can't take
not knowing anymore.

24:52.684 --> 24:55.987
I won't stop looking for them
until we find them.

24:56.054 --> 24:57.221
Okay?

25:00.058 --> 25:01.225
Okay.

25:03.195 --> 25:05.241
Hoyt is behind the murder
of Graham Randall,

25:05.361 --> 25:06.995
and the disappearance
of the Wilson family.

25:07.063 --> 25:08.229
I need to talk to him.

25:08.297 --> 25:09.531
You can forget that, Rizzoli.

25:09.598 --> 25:11.166
There ain't a chance in hell

25:11.233 --> 25:13.001
Warden Price's gonna
let you go at Hoyt again.

25:13.069 --> 25:14.202
And frankly, I wouldn't either.

25:14.270 --> 25:15.537
You're too close to this.

25:15.604 --> 25:17.405
Sean, Hoyt's given us clues
we can't ignore.

25:17.473 --> 25:18.873
But you haven't
given me anything

25:18.941 --> 25:20.175
that proves he had
anything to do

25:20.242 --> 25:21.443
with this family's
disappearance.

25:21.510 --> 25:23.011
He could just be
yanking your chain.

25:23.079 --> 25:24.412
You think he was
yanking Graham's

25:24.480 --> 25:26.314
when he gave him a balloon full
of teeth to swallow?

25:26.382 --> 25:29.184
Trophies from his victims that
somebody smuggled into jail for him?

25:29.251 --> 25:31.608
You don't know who those
teeth belong to, Vince.

25:31.728 --> 25:32.362
Yet.

25:32.482 --> 25:33.488
Okay, fine.

25:33.556 --> 25:35.023
If you won't let me talk
to Hoyt,

25:35.091 --> 25:36.958
then, please,
just listen to our theory.

25:37.026 --> 25:38.626
Did you come through
the west gate?

25:38.694 --> 25:40.328
Okay.

25:40.396 --> 25:42.464
Westgate Park.

25:42.531 --> 25:45.100
- Right near B.C.
- And?

25:45.167 --> 25:47.268
And we think
that Hoyt's ego got bruised

25:47.336 --> 25:49.337
when he ran into
his old Professor...

25:49.405 --> 25:51.206
So he followed the family
into the park and murdered them.

25:51.273 --> 25:53.041
We think he dumped their bodies
somewhere in that park.

25:53.109 --> 25:54.376
This park is over
four acres of land.

25:54.443 --> 25:55.610
And even with cadaver dogs,

25:55.678 --> 25:57.512
you've got to narrow
the search.

25:57.580 --> 25:58.913
What about using GPRS?

25:58.981 --> 26:00.448
Ground-penetrating radar?

26:00.516 --> 26:02.984
You're talking about a $100,000
fishing expedition.

26:03.052 --> 26:04.686
And I still don't get
what one case

26:04.754 --> 26:06.287
has to do with the other.

26:06.355 --> 26:08.456
And we won't unless we go look
for those bodies.

26:08.524 --> 26:10.658
Come in.

26:10.726 --> 26:12.093
I've got the DNA results.

26:12.161 --> 26:14.629
I know you've been waiting
for them.

26:16.399 --> 26:19.267
It's the Wilsons.
Can we go fishing now?

26:57.706 --> 27:00.008
Come on.
Find something damn it.

27:00.076 --> 27:01.743
We've been out here eight hours,
Rizzoli...

27:01.811 --> 27:04.612
Nothing... no sign
of any human remains.

27:04.680 --> 27:06.548
Those bodies are out here.
We got to keep looking.

27:08.184 --> 27:09.384
We've combed all four acres.

27:10.486 --> 27:11.719
Crap. Press.

27:11.787 --> 27:14.289
- We're done here.
- Hey, Rizzoli.

27:15.724 --> 27:17.192
What are you digging
in Westgate Park for?

27:17.259 --> 27:20.695
We're, uh, looking up a lead
in a cold case.

27:20.763 --> 27:22.363
Aw, come on, an official
at the jail told us

27:22.431 --> 27:24.299
you're not out here looking
for Graham Randall's killer.

27:24.366 --> 27:26.634
I don't have a comment
on the Randall case.

27:26.702 --> 27:29.003
Oh, so a prisoner who gets
murdered in jail, Rizzoli...

27:29.071 --> 27:30.371
that's not important to you?

27:30.439 --> 27:33.308
Come on, come on,
come on. Come on.

27:35.244 --> 27:37.178
An "official at the jail."
Gee, I wonder what is.

27:37.246 --> 27:38.713
Warden Price.

27:38.781 --> 27:41.216
I'd like to hand him
his nuts right about now!

27:44.553 --> 27:47.655
Eagles, westgate...

27:47.723 --> 27:51.526
leaves, white velvet...

27:51.594 --> 27:53.361
Where are they?

27:53.429 --> 27:55.263
If you over-secrete
glucocorticoids

27:55.331 --> 27:56.531
you won't be able to think.

27:56.599 --> 27:58.533
Try to relax.

27:58.601 --> 28:00.535
Oh, yeah, sure.
I know...

28:00.603 --> 28:03.538
Why don't we take a midnight
hot-air-balloon ride?

28:03.606 --> 28:06.407
I thought it would be
a unique experience, okay?

28:06.475 --> 28:08.409
Okay? But that's fine.
It's all right.

28:08.477 --> 28:10.745
You know, just save me
a lot of agony,

28:10.813 --> 28:13.715
and tell me what you want.

28:13.782 --> 28:15.517
A horse.

28:15.584 --> 28:18.052
- Really?
- Yes.

28:18.120 --> 28:20.622
A thoroughbred.
And I'll name him Walter.

28:20.689 --> 28:23.024
And he can live here
in the apartment, with me,

28:23.092 --> 28:24.659
and I'll ride him
every day to work.

28:24.727 --> 28:27.395
A lot of people wouldn't put up
with your abuse.

28:27.463 --> 28:31.733
Okay, don't get me anything.
Pretend it's not my birthday.

28:31.800 --> 28:33.635
I <i>hate</i> my birthday.

28:33.702 --> 28:35.136
Well, what is the big whoop?

28:35.204 --> 28:37.172
I mean, why can't
you just let people

28:37.239 --> 28:38.640
do something nice for you?

28:38.707 --> 28:41.075
Did you just say,
"what's the big whoop"?

28:41.143 --> 28:42.577
What's wrong
with that expression?

28:42.645 --> 28:44.112
Nothing. I love it.

28:44.180 --> 28:46.247
I'm gonna say it
all the time now.

28:46.315 --> 28:47.515
What's the big whoop?

28:47.583 --> 28:49.184
Okay, well, what is it?

28:49.251 --> 28:50.351
All right, fine...
You want to know

28:50.419 --> 28:51.519
why I don't like my birthday?

28:52.922 --> 28:58.159
Because it never turns out
the way I imagined it.

28:58.227 --> 28:59.827
And you don't like
to be disappointed.

28:59.895 --> 29:01.262
Yeah.

29:01.330 --> 29:05.200
Help me find the Wilsons.

29:07.836 --> 29:11.139
<i>The leaves were beautiful.</i>

29:11.207 --> 29:14.809
<i>Even the weeping willows
turned yellow that year.</i>

29:14.877 --> 29:18.513
Maybe that's what we missed...
The weeping willows.

29:18.581 --> 29:20.515
No. I didn't
miss anything.

29:20.583 --> 29:23.751
And there are no weeping willows
in Westgate Park.

29:23.819 --> 29:25.386
Well, many of them died
from crown gall.

29:25.454 --> 29:27.555
And I need to know this
because...?

29:27.623 --> 29:29.891
Well, weeping willows
grow near water...

29:29.959 --> 29:31.459
Lakes or ponds.

29:31.527 --> 29:33.795
Hoyt said...

29:33.862 --> 29:36.598
"Eagles
don't drink water."

29:36.665 --> 29:39.400
Well, they get most of their
hydration from their diet,

29:39.468 --> 29:41.769
but they do on occasion.

29:41.837 --> 29:44.472
No, he said, did you go
through the west gate?

29:44.540 --> 29:46.641
That's it!

29:46.709 --> 29:49.777
Not in the park...
Leaving the park!

29:51.380 --> 29:53.648
- Well, who are you calling?
- Korsak.

29:53.716 --> 29:55.450
I know where the Wilsons are.

30:37.626 --> 30:42.897
1996 baby blue Mercury wagon.
That's the Wilsons' car.

30:42.965 --> 30:45.600
They were in this pond
the whole time.

30:45.668 --> 30:46.834
Hoyt even put 'em
in their seats.

30:46.902 --> 30:48.636
Damn.

30:48.704 --> 30:51.339
That's how they disappeared
off the face of the earth.

30:51.407 --> 30:54.676
We still have to tie Hoyt
to Graham's murder.

30:54.743 --> 30:56.644
What about the bail money?

30:56.712 --> 30:58.546
Probably still with
the bail commissioner.

30:58.614 --> 30:59.781
I'll go check it out.

30:59.848 --> 31:01.316
Okay.

31:01.383 --> 31:04.218
Why would Hoyt
decide to tell me now?

31:04.286 --> 31:06.554
Bastard just wants the credit
for this before he dies.

31:07.990 --> 31:09.791
Yeah, maybe.

31:15.526 --> 31:17.794
It's my opinion,

31:17.862 --> 31:20.263
based on the tool marks
I'm finding

31:20.331 --> 31:22.833
on all the C-3 vertebrae,
that the victims

31:22.900 --> 31:25.702
suffered a lateral
incised wound...

31:25.770 --> 31:27.404
That would have encompassed

31:27.472 --> 31:30.740
both left and right carotids
and jugulars.

31:30.808 --> 31:32.609
So their throats were slit.

31:32.677 --> 31:34.277
Yes.

31:34.345 --> 31:36.780
Probably just
eating sandwiches,

31:36.848 --> 31:40.383
enjoying a beautiful fall day,

31:40.451 --> 31:42.219
and Hoyt came across them.

31:42.286 --> 31:44.888
My guess is he went after
one of the children first,

31:44.956 --> 31:48.225
used her to keep
everybody else in line.

31:51.629 --> 31:53.263
Rizzoli.

31:53.331 --> 31:55.432
Okay.

31:55.500 --> 31:58.201
And the warden okay'd that?

32:00.271 --> 32:02.606
Yeah,
I-I'll be right there.

32:03.641 --> 32:05.141
Hoyt's dying,

32:05.209 --> 32:06.510
and he told the guard
he wants to see me.

32:06.577 --> 32:08.478
Do you think
that's a good idea?

32:08.546 --> 32:11.248
He says he's prepared to give up
the names and burial sites

32:11.315 --> 32:12.716
of every person he's murdered.

32:12.783 --> 32:15.385
- I'm going with you.
- Why?

32:15.453 --> 32:17.821
Hoyt's on a massive dose
of morphine.

32:17.889 --> 32:20.924
I might be able to help
you navigate what's true

32:20.992 --> 32:23.393
and what's
drug-induced fantasy.

32:25.630 --> 32:27.230
You're not gonna believe this.

32:27.298 --> 32:29.199
Bail commissioner
didn't know what to do

32:29.267 --> 32:31.701
with the envelope of bail money
after Graham was killed,

32:31.769 --> 32:33.236
so he locked it up.

32:33.304 --> 32:36.239
Maybe we can lift prints.

32:38.543 --> 32:42.212
I'll take you
to the infirmary.

32:42.280 --> 32:43.613
Is Hoyt lucid?

32:43.681 --> 32:45.181
Doctor said he won't last
through the night.

32:45.249 --> 32:46.917
You got a half-hour with him,
understand?

32:46.984 --> 32:49.219
You don't tell me how long
I can talk to him.

32:49.287 --> 32:50.720
I'll talk to him till he's dead

32:50.788 --> 32:52.789
if that means solving
one more of his murders.

32:52.857 --> 32:55.258
And I hope that's not
too "hysterical" for you.

32:58.462 --> 33:00.297
Just the bail
commissioner's prints.

33:00.364 --> 33:01.731
Graham's angel was too smart

33:01.799 --> 33:02.832
to leave prints
on the envelope.

33:02.900 --> 33:04.534
Let's try the money.

33:04.602 --> 33:06.536
We got 50 $100 bills here.

33:06.604 --> 33:08.004
Let's do iodine fuming.

33:13.578 --> 33:17.447
Why doesn't she ever
talk to me about it?

33:17.515 --> 33:20.684
What did he do to you, Rizzoli?

33:20.751 --> 33:23.186
A little help down here!

33:23.254 --> 33:25.755
What Hoyt did to her,
you can't talk about.

33:25.823 --> 33:27.591
Just leave it alone, Frost.

33:27.658 --> 33:28.892
You were with her
when it happened.

33:28.960 --> 33:30.493
She's my partner, too,
Korsak.

33:30.561 --> 33:32.495
You see what it does to her.

33:32.563 --> 33:35.265
I can't help her
if she won't talk to me.

33:35.333 --> 33:36.566
The only thing
that's gonna help her

33:36.634 --> 33:37.901
is to shovel dirt
on that bastard's grave.

33:37.969 --> 33:40.704
Give me the bill
on the bottom.

33:58.689 --> 34:01.224
Looks like the angel
touched the money.

34:01.292 --> 34:02.993
Let's hope so.

34:03.060 --> 34:06.596
Probably a thumbprint.
I'll get it entered into AFIS.

34:15.873 --> 34:17.407
Hoyt.

34:19.043 --> 34:20.409
He's been in and out of it.

34:22.045 --> 34:24.614
It's not fair.

34:24.681 --> 34:25.982
Maybe he'll still
be able to talk to you.

34:27.585 --> 34:29.853
It's not fair because...

34:29.920 --> 34:32.455
how could a person who tortured
so many people

34:32.523 --> 34:33.922
get to go out so peacefully?

34:35.493 --> 34:36.826
Jane...

34:38.429 --> 34:40.897
Jane...

34:40.965 --> 34:43.933
Jane...

34:44.001 --> 34:45.034
Come closer.

34:47.405 --> 34:52.308
I have more bad things
to tell you.

34:52.376 --> 34:55.344
I'm here.

34:57.081 --> 35:00.583
Aah! Get him off me!

35:00.651 --> 35:02.652
I think I'll watch.

35:03.688 --> 35:06.723
Happy Birthday, Jane.

35:09.493 --> 35:11.928
We got a hit.

35:11.996 --> 35:13.797
Who is it?
Candidate... Rod Mason,

35:13.864 --> 35:16.533
Brimmer Street Jail.
He's a guard.

35:16.600 --> 35:18.601
That's not good, Frost.
He's Hoyt's guard.

35:18.669 --> 35:20.036
Damn. Rod Mason
is Hoyt's apprentice.

35:20.104 --> 35:21.571
I'm getting a recording
at the jail.

35:21.639 --> 35:24.774
They're in lockdown.

35:26.377 --> 35:28.478
I was so hoping
you were smart enough

35:28.546 --> 35:30.380
to put together my clues.

35:30.448 --> 35:32.048
Was it fun?

35:32.116 --> 35:33.817
Like a murder treasure hunt?

35:33.884 --> 35:36.419
I should have killed you
when I had the chance.

35:36.487 --> 35:38.555
Yeah. You should have.

35:40.958 --> 35:42.525
The taser.

35:47.031 --> 35:48.865
I could turn it on if you like.

35:48.933 --> 35:50.300
No!

35:50.367 --> 35:53.036
I always finish what I start.

35:56.040 --> 35:57.607
He played you, Mason.

35:57.675 --> 35:59.876
Just like he plays all
his little apprentices.

35:59.944 --> 36:01.978
I'm not the one wearing
zip ties, detective.

36:02.046 --> 36:03.513
What was in it for you?

36:03.581 --> 36:06.382
Well... it was fun.

36:06.450 --> 36:08.017
Kid was all proud of himself,
you know.

36:08.085 --> 36:10.787
Going off to law school.
Big deal.

36:10.855 --> 36:14.424
Idiot was dropping off mystery
books for a serial killer.

36:14.492 --> 36:16.259
I love mysteries.

36:16.327 --> 36:18.057
So you were the one that
set up his bail.

36:18.177 --> 36:18.871
Yeah.

36:18.991 --> 36:21.731
All he had to do for the 5k
was swallow a balloon.

36:21.799 --> 36:23.500
It was too good to be true

36:23.567 --> 36:26.970
when little Graham told me
he was off to Boston College

36:27.037 --> 36:28.671
to be a double eagle.

36:28.739 --> 36:31.007
I knew then that he would be
the perfect envelope

36:31.075 --> 36:34.711
for my letter to you.

36:34.779 --> 36:36.346
It's time.

36:44.655 --> 36:46.890
You killed him.

36:46.957 --> 36:48.725
That's why the edges of
the stab wounds were so clean.

36:48.793 --> 36:52.061
That's very good,
Dr. Isles.

36:52.129 --> 36:56.432
Though rod doesn't wield his
scalpels with the same finesse,

36:56.500 --> 37:00.603
he did get Graham here
so I could be here with you.

37:02.540 --> 37:06.075
I'm dying, and I want company.

37:06.143 --> 37:09.379
I think I'm gonna take you
and Dr. Isles with me.

37:17.297 --> 37:19.098
It's locked!
From the inside.

37:19.166 --> 37:20.633
Bypass it from
the guard station!

37:20.701 --> 37:21.801
Get on that radio... now!

37:21.869 --> 37:24.370
Hold her down.

37:34.415 --> 37:36.382
- No!
- I win, Jane.

37:36.450 --> 37:38.918
Hoyt, don't you touch her!

37:43.123 --> 37:45.591
You're gonna feel
a little pinch, doctor.

37:45.659 --> 37:48.661
No! Stop it!

37:48.729 --> 37:50.163
Shut up!

38:18.926 --> 38:21.694
I win.

38:22.796 --> 38:24.831
And you're going to hell alone.

38:41.849 --> 38:45.151
You okay, doc?

38:45.219 --> 38:46.853
You okay?

38:48.255 --> 38:49.722
You okay?

38:49.790 --> 38:51.224
Yeah.

38:51.291 --> 38:54.093
Yeah.

38:55.329 --> 38:56.863
You're okay.

39:06.039 --> 39:10.209
Okay, yeah, yeah...
"Surprise!"

39:12.279 --> 39:14.881
Hello?

39:17.784 --> 39:20.386
Surprise.

39:35.969 --> 39:37.403
Surprise! Surprise! Surprise! Surprise!

39:37.471 --> 39:39.038
God almighty!

39:40.541 --> 39:42.108
Wow!

39:42.175 --> 39:46.279
I looked everywhere
for "My Pretty Pony."

39:46.346 --> 39:49.181
I hope this is okay.

39:49.249 --> 39:51.450
This is fantastic, ma.
Thank you.

39:51.518 --> 39:52.818
Happy Birthday.

39:52.886 --> 39:54.954
Thank you. Wow.

39:55.022 --> 39:57.423
Dr. Finicky drinking beer
out of a can?

39:57.491 --> 39:59.458
And a lot of it after today.

39:59.526 --> 40:01.060
Although I can taste
the aluminum.

40:02.996 --> 40:05.431
Mm.

40:05.499 --> 40:08.901
Well, I got my wish.
Hoyt's dead.

40:10.003 --> 40:12.038
A gift to the world.
Happy Birthday, Jane.

40:16.076 --> 40:17.510
- Hey.
- What?

40:17.578 --> 40:19.178
Happy Birthday.

40:23.283 --> 40:24.984
You got a 96 on your exam?

40:25.052 --> 40:27.086
Oh, yeah, you really bombed it.

40:27.154 --> 40:29.188
He had a pretty good tutor.

40:29.256 --> 40:30.756
Why are you taking the credit?

40:30.824 --> 40:32.024
I taught him
everything he knows.

40:32.092 --> 40:33.025
- Huh?
- All right.

40:33.093 --> 40:34.126
All right.

40:36.530 --> 40:37.897
Aw.

40:37.965 --> 40:39.899
- Oh, boy.
- Well...

40:39.967 --> 40:43.336
This looks a lot smaller
than Walter the thoroughbred.

40:43.403 --> 40:45.171
I hope you like them.

40:47.074 --> 40:48.341
They're...

40:48.408 --> 40:50.343
Driving shoes.

40:50.410 --> 40:51.944
Racing shoes.

40:52.012 --> 40:54.981
They're fully lined with
fire-resistant Dupont Nomex.

40:55.048 --> 40:57.850
And... I need these...

40:57.918 --> 40:59.051
because...

40:59.119 --> 41:01.454
Um...

41:05.492 --> 41:07.793
Racing school?

41:07.861 --> 41:09.929
You're sending me
to racing school?!

41:09.997 --> 41:11.831
Well, you know,
Walter's highest speed

41:11.898 --> 41:13.032
is 40 miles per hour.

41:13.100 --> 41:14.533
And the Lamborghini Murciélago

41:14.601 --> 41:16.068
LP640's highest speed is 211!

41:16.136 --> 41:18.237
Well, do you like it?

41:18.357 --> 41:20.221
Yes! Yes!
Thank you so much!

41:20.341 --> 41:22.200
Oh, it's so much better than a horse!

41:23.713 --> 41:24.851
Oh my God!
