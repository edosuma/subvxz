00:10.144 --> 00:11.510
<i>¶ A hideaway at sea </i>

00:11.512 --> 00:13.946

00:13.948 --> 00:15.981

- Yo-ho.

00:20.254 --> 00:22.054
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

00:22.056 --> 00:25.224

00:31.499 --> 00:34.466

<i>We need some volunteers ¶</i>

00:34.468 --> 00:36.201

00:36.203 --> 00:37.736

01:00.061 --> 01:01.560
Ha-har.

01:03.096 --> 01:04.630
Ahoy, mateys.

01:04.632 --> 01:07.366
Do you want to join
my pirate crew?

01:08.802 --> 01:09.802
Great.

01:09.804 --> 01:11.470
To start today's adventure,

01:11.472 --> 01:14.239
everybody say
the Pirate Password:

01:14.241 --> 01:15.674
Yo-ho ho.

01:15.676 --> 01:19.211
- [all] Yo-ho ho.
- One more time.

01:19.213 --> 01:21.747
[all] Yo-ho ho.

01:25.051 --> 01:26.885
<i>[Jake]</i> Jake's Special
Delivery.

01:26.887 --> 01:29.455
[all shouting]

01:35.028 --> 01:37.396
And the winner
of the first Never Land

01:37.398 --> 01:41.633
Coconut Rolling Race
Championship is Cubby.

01:41.635 --> 01:43.035
Coconuts.

01:43.037 --> 01:45.037
I'm the Coconut Champ.

01:45.039 --> 01:47.206
Way to go, Cubby.

01:47.208 --> 01:50.509
Say, what's that
out on the water?

01:50.511 --> 01:53.312
- Package ahoy.
- Who's it for?

01:53.314 --> 01:54.413
I don't know.

01:54.415 --> 01:56.815
The name on the label's
been washed away.

01:56.817 --> 02:00.886
Oh. Maybe it's a box
of crackers for me.

02:00.888 --> 02:02.821
And maybe not.

02:02.823 --> 02:05.023
We don't know who
this package is for.

02:05.025 --> 02:06.525
It could be for anybody.

02:06.527 --> 02:09.394
[Hook] Blast.
I need food.

02:09.396 --> 02:11.597
Grub.
I need lunch.

02:11.599 --> 02:15.634
I need something for
the rumblin' in me tummy.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.402
[gasping] What's this?

02:17.404 --> 02:19.771
Jake and his puny pirates.

02:19.773 --> 02:21.540
And they have a treasure?

02:21.542 --> 02:24.243
Smee, set sail
for Never Land.

02:24.245 --> 02:26.912
Cap'n, I thought
you wanted lunch.

02:26.914 --> 02:28.914
Oh, I'm hungry,
all right.

02:28.916 --> 02:31.783
But I'm even hungrier
for treasure.

02:31.785 --> 02:34.052
And I'll bet
me best boots

02:34.054 --> 02:35.554
there's something wonderful

02:35.556 --> 02:39.892
and treasureful
inside that box.

02:39.894 --> 02:42.528
Who do you think
this package belongs to?

02:42.530 --> 02:43.962
Check it out.

02:43.964 --> 02:45.664
The name may be
washed off the label,

02:45.666 --> 02:47.199
but there's a map.

02:47.201 --> 02:49.735
Maybe it will show us where
to deliver this package.

02:49.737 --> 02:53.872
Say, mateys, will you help us
deliver this package?

02:55.175 --> 02:56.408
Great!

02:56.410 --> 02:58.443
Keep a lookout
for gold doubloons.

02:58.445 --> 03:00.546
Whenever we solve
a Pirate Problem together,

03:00.548 --> 03:03.048
they'll appear.
Then we'll collect 'em

03:03.050 --> 03:05.450
and put 'em in
our Team Treasure Chest.

03:05.452 --> 03:07.519
Yo ho, let's go.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.421
Is everybody ready?

03:09.423 --> 03:10.923
I got my sword.

03:10.925 --> 03:12.357
I got my map.

03:12.359 --> 03:14.760
And I've got
my Pixie Dust.

03:14.762 --> 03:18.030
The fairies gave it to me
so that we can use it to fly.

03:18.032 --> 03:20.132
But only in emergencies.

03:20.134 --> 03:24.770
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys, away! </i>

03:24.772 --> 03:27.272
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

03:27.274 --> 03:28.640
<i>¶ Let's go </i>

03:28.642 --> 03:32.010
<i>¶ Heave ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

03:32.012 --> 03:34.780
<i>¶ Jake and the</i>
<i>Never Land Pirates ¶</i>

03:34.782 --> 03:37.249
<i>¶ And me </i>

03:39.052 --> 03:40.452
According to the map,

03:40.454 --> 03:42.921
we start by crossing
Floating Rock Canyon.

03:42.923 --> 03:44.456
Whoa.

03:44.458 --> 03:48.060
I better be extra careful
with this package.

03:48.062 --> 03:49.761
Careful, now.

03:49.763 --> 03:51.496
Easy does it.

03:51.498 --> 03:54.600
[all] Yo ho, way to go!

03:54.602 --> 03:56.969
[all] Captain Hook!

03:56.971 --> 03:59.438
The pleasure is all mine.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.907
and so is your little
treasure package.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.175
[shrieking]

04:03.177 --> 04:05.377
- [Jake] Oh, no!
- [Skully] Crackers!

04:05.379 --> 04:06.678
[all] Whew!

04:06.680 --> 04:10.649
Well, go on, Smee.
Go get me package.

04:10.651 --> 04:13.218
Going. Getting.

04:13.220 --> 04:16.722
[both shouting]

04:16.724 --> 04:18.890
Yo ho, I don't think so!

04:18.892 --> 04:20.192
- Yay!
- Yay hey!

04:20.194 --> 04:21.560
Whew!

04:21.562 --> 04:23.128
Blast!

04:24.564 --> 04:26.164
Yay-hey.

04:26.166 --> 04:29.735
We saved the package
and got three gold doubloons.

04:29.737 --> 04:33.205
Let's grab 'em and
go help Captain Hook.

04:33.207 --> 04:36.675
I do not need help
from puny...

04:36.677 --> 04:39.011
[both shouting]

04:39.013 --> 04:40.445
[groaning]

04:40.447 --> 04:44.650
Told you I...
didn't need your help.

04:44.652 --> 04:47.486
- OK, Hook.
- [all] See ya' later.

04:48.788 --> 04:50.822
[Cubby] The map
on the package

04:50.824 --> 04:54.092
says we need to go up
Up Falls.

04:54.094 --> 04:56.061
- [all sniffing]
- Mmm.

04:56.063 --> 04:58.230
Something smells good.

04:58.232 --> 04:59.898
I think it's
coming from...

04:59.900 --> 05:02.334
Hey! Captain Hook.

05:02.336 --> 05:06.104
Ha-ha! You didn't
see that coming.

05:06.106 --> 05:07.806
Oh.
Watch where you're...

05:11.010 --> 05:12.010
...going.

05:12.012 --> 05:13.712
Blast!

05:13.714 --> 05:15.447
[shouting]

05:16.983 --> 05:20.218
[coughing]
Blasted rising water.

05:20.220 --> 05:24.523
I can never get used
to riding up a waterfall.

05:24.525 --> 05:26.391
Well, now that we're up,

05:26.393 --> 05:28.927
we might want to
find a way down.

05:28.929 --> 05:30.462
[snarling] A-ha!

05:30.464 --> 05:33.799
[ticking]

05:33.801 --> 05:36.368
[stammering]
Tick-Tock Croc!

05:36.370 --> 05:39.571
Ah! Save me, Smee.

05:39.573 --> 05:42.107
Love to, Cap'n,
but the water

05:42.109 --> 05:44.910
keeps pushing us
towards old Tick Tock.

05:44.912 --> 05:47.846
Sounds like Hook and
Mr. Smee are in trouble.

05:47.848 --> 05:50.182
Come on.
We can ride this log

05:50.184 --> 05:52.851
up the falls
and help them.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.920
I'm afraid
this is it, Smee.

05:54.922 --> 05:56.955
Our final voyage.

05:56.957 --> 06:00.325
It's been an honor, Cap'n.

06:00.327 --> 06:02.160
[Jake] Rescue ahoy.

06:02.162 --> 06:04.463
- [Hook exclaiming]
- [Smee] Oh, dear!

06:04.465 --> 06:06.698
Gotcha.

06:06.700 --> 06:09.034
[Jake] Time for
some shore leave.

06:09.036 --> 06:11.570
Yay-hey.
We saved Hook and Smee

06:11.572 --> 06:13.071
from the Tick Tock Croc

06:13.073 --> 06:15.540
and we got
three more gold doubloons.

06:15.542 --> 06:19.644
Let's grab 'em and
go deliver the package.

06:19.646 --> 06:21.513
Is everyone shipshape?

06:21.515 --> 06:23.815
Aye-aye.
Thanks for saving us

06:23.817 --> 06:26.318
from that naughty
Tick Tock Croc.

06:26.320 --> 06:29.020
And thanks for keeping
an eye on me package.

06:29.022 --> 06:30.522
Ta-ta!

06:30.524 --> 06:33.859
Hey, that is not
your package!

06:33.861 --> 06:36.962
I just need to get away
from those pipsqueak pirates

06:36.964 --> 06:40.665
long enough to finally see
what's inside this package.

06:40.667 --> 06:42.267
Careful, Captain Hook.

06:42.269 --> 06:45.737
That way leads to
Bouncy Boulder Hill.

06:45.739 --> 06:49.074
Did he say
Bouncy Boulder...

06:49.076 --> 06:51.042
[both screaming]

06:55.481 --> 06:57.382
[all cheering]

06:57.384 --> 06:59.951
Captain Hook.
Mr. Smee.

06:59.953 --> 07:01.553
Are you two all right?

07:01.555 --> 07:04.523
[both wheezing]

07:04.525 --> 07:06.458
[Smee muttering]

07:06.460 --> 07:09.294
You need to take
better care of your things.

07:09.296 --> 07:12.864
Especially when those things
don't belong to you.

07:12.866 --> 07:14.299
Now, if you'll
excuse us,

07:14.301 --> 07:16.301
we've gotta make
a special delivery.

07:16.303 --> 07:18.270
[Hook muttering]
What?

07:18.272 --> 07:21.440
Me package.
Come on, Smee, I...

07:21.442 --> 07:23.708
Uh, Mr. Smee?

07:23.710 --> 07:27.312
[stammering]
Coming, Cap'n.

07:27.314 --> 07:29.214
[muttering]

07:30.249 --> 07:33.018
According to the map,
this is it.

07:33.020 --> 07:35.454
The package is supposed
to be delivered to this...

07:35.456 --> 07:38.156
- [screeching]
- ...cave.

07:38.158 --> 07:40.759
Let's leave it and go.

07:40.761 --> 07:43.328
Cubby, we can't
leave it out here.

07:43.330 --> 07:46.264
- Hook will swipe it again.
- Izzy's right.

07:46.266 --> 07:49.234
We have to take it inside and
find the person it belongs to.

07:49.236 --> 07:53.071
There they are.
Heading towards a cave.

07:53.073 --> 07:56.675
[gasping]
I know that cave.

07:56.677 --> 07:58.510
Oh, you do?

07:58.512 --> 08:01.313
Quickly, Smee.
Step lively.

08:01.315 --> 08:04.649
Crackers, I'm gettin'
a weird feeling.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.718
Have we been here before?

08:06.720 --> 08:09.621
Yeah, this place
seems familiar.

08:09.623 --> 08:11.823
Too familiar.

08:11.825 --> 08:15.160
Hey, look.
Pictures of old Feather Hat.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.195
I knew we'd
been here before.

08:17.197 --> 08:19.130
This isn't just any cave.

08:19.132 --> 08:21.700
This is Captain Hook's
Treasure Cave.

08:21.702 --> 08:23.668
Shiver me timbers.

08:23.670 --> 08:25.537
That means this package
was meant for...

08:25.539 --> 08:27.339
[all] Captain Hook!

08:27.341 --> 08:30.308
And that means this path
is booby-trapped.

08:30.310 --> 08:33.345
Now, which tiles were
the safe ones to walk on?

08:33.347 --> 08:34.946
Was it this one?

08:34.948 --> 08:36.948
- Whoa!
- Careful, Jake!

08:36.950 --> 08:39.251
Oh, no!
The package.

08:39.253 --> 08:41.086
This is an emergency.

08:41.088 --> 08:42.888
And I know what to do.

08:42.890 --> 08:45.457
Pixie Dust away!

08:50.363 --> 08:53.532
Now, that's an even
nicer save, crew.

08:53.534 --> 08:56.301
Yay-hey.
We saved the package,

08:56.303 --> 08:59.037
and we got three more
gold doubloons.

08:59.039 --> 09:02.941
Let's grab 'em and go
finish our delivery.

09:02.943 --> 09:05.810
So, you miniature marauders

09:05.812 --> 09:09.714
thought you could plunder
me treasure cave too, eh?

09:09.716 --> 09:11.516
We're not here
to plunder,

09:11.518 --> 09:13.552
we just want
to deliver this package.

09:13.554 --> 09:15.887
You mean my package.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.489
Right, it...

09:17.491 --> 09:19.925
It really is your package.

09:19.927 --> 09:22.460
[chuckles] How about that,
Captain Hook?

09:22.462 --> 09:25.163
The whole time you were
swiping the package from us,

09:25.165 --> 09:27.265
we were trying
to deliver it to you.

09:27.267 --> 09:30.702
Well, what took you
so long?

09:30.704 --> 09:34.139
[chuckling]
Now I can finally see

09:34.141 --> 09:37.542
what treasure awaits
inside for me.

09:37.544 --> 09:40.679
Ooh, a note.
What's it say, Cap'n?

09:40.681 --> 09:42.247
[clears throat]

09:42.249 --> 09:43.848
"Dear James,

09:43.850 --> 09:47.252
I baked you a batch of
your favorite sea biscuits.

09:47.254 --> 09:50.088
Love, Mama Hook."

09:50.090 --> 09:52.757
Mummy!

09:52.759 --> 09:55.727
Oh, isn't that sweet.

09:55.729 --> 09:59.965
Mummy's delicious sea biscuits
are just what me tummy needs.

09:59.967 --> 10:03.068
I can't wait to
sink me teeth into...

10:03.070 --> 10:06.371
Oh, dear. I guess we should
have been more careful

10:06.373 --> 10:10.542
when we kept swiping,
uh, your treasure.

10:10.544 --> 10:12.243
Mummy's sea biscuits.

10:12.245 --> 10:15.080
They're all ruined.

10:16.382 --> 10:18.483
[mumbling] Mmm, yum.

10:18.485 --> 10:21.119
Well, they may be
crumbly, but...

10:21.121 --> 10:23.922
...mmm, they are
still tasty.

10:23.924 --> 10:26.558
They are?
Well, then, everyone,

10:26.560 --> 10:29.594
even you puny pirates,
must try some.

10:29.596 --> 10:33.164
You know, I've loved them ever
since I was a wee pirate lad.

10:33.166 --> 10:34.933
- Mmm.
- All right.

10:34.935 --> 10:36.868
- Yummy.
- Crackers.

10:36.870 --> 10:38.837
Those are great biscuits.

10:38.839 --> 10:40.171
Here's to Mama Hook

10:40.173 --> 10:42.273
and her delicious
sea biscuits.

10:42.275 --> 10:45.210
- Hip-hip.
- [all] Hooray!

10:47.413 --> 10:49.247
Thanks for helping us
deliver the package

10:49.249 --> 10:51.016
to Captain Hook,
mateys.

10:51.018 --> 10:52.717
Now let's count
our gold doubloons

10:52.719 --> 10:55.086
and put 'em in our
Team Treasure Chest.

11:02.161 --> 11:04.429
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

11:04.431 --> 11:06.564
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>
<i>just what to do ¶</i>

11:06.566 --> 11:08.600
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>with help from you ¶</i>

11:08.602 --> 11:11.603
<i>¶ It's time to count</i>
<i>our gold doubloons ¶</i>

11:11.605 --> 11:14.005
Come on, count with us.

11:15.207 --> 11:16.541
[all] Yeah!

11:17.777 --> 11:20.545
[Jake] One, two, three...

11:20.547 --> 11:22.914
[Cubby]
Four, five, six...

11:22.916 --> 11:25.750
[Izzy] Seven, eight, nine.

11:25.752 --> 11:29.087
[Jake] Yo-ho. For solving
Pirate Problems today,

11:29.089 --> 11:31.456
we got nine gold doubloons.

11:31.458 --> 11:33.224
Ahoy.

11:33.226 --> 11:35.560
Special delivery
for Skully.

11:35.562 --> 11:38.530
Crackers.
For me?

11:38.532 --> 11:41.633
Whoo-hoo! Just what
I always wanted.

11:41.635 --> 11:44.169
Crackers for me.

11:44.171 --> 11:46.337
[all laughing]

11:48.708 --> 11:50.642
[mumbling]

11:50.644 --> 11:52.343
- [doorbell ringing]
- Huh?

11:52.345 --> 11:54.212
More presents from Mummy?

11:58.784 --> 12:00.518
Nice crocky.

12:00.520 --> 12:01.953
Oh, dear.

12:01.955 --> 12:05.090
Looks like someone else
is looking for a yummy snack.

12:05.092 --> 12:07.826
[shouting] Smee!

12:09.628 --> 12:12.764
Comin', Cap'n.
I'm a-comin'.

12:16.435 --> 12:19.104
<i>[Izzy]</i> Seahorse Saddle-Up.

12:19.106 --> 12:21.906
[Cubby]
Whoa! Mateys!

12:21.908 --> 12:24.008
Little help!

12:24.010 --> 12:25.944
Nice rocking
seahorse, Cubby.

12:25.946 --> 12:28.580
You gettin' ready
for the Seahorse
Saddle-Up Challenge today?

12:28.582 --> 12:29.881
Yeah.

12:29.883 --> 12:33.084
I wanted to get in
some extra practice,

12:33.086 --> 12:36.020
but, I think
I'm gonna fall.

12:36.022 --> 12:37.288
[both] Gotcha.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.257
Thanks, mateys.
[chuckles]

12:39.259 --> 12:42.794
I'll be better on a real
seahorse, I promise.

12:42.796 --> 12:44.729
Aw, you'll do great,
Cubby.

12:44.731 --> 12:46.965
I can't wait to
saddle up my sea horse,

12:46.967 --> 12:49.000
Sea Flower,
and ride.

12:49.002 --> 12:51.336
Say mateys,
want to ride with us

12:51.338 --> 12:54.005
in the Seahorse
Saddle-Up Challenge?

12:55.007 --> 12:56.241
Great!

12:56.243 --> 12:58.510
Keep a lookout
for gold doubloons.

12:58.512 --> 13:00.612
Whenever we solve
a Pirate Problem together,

13:00.614 --> 13:02.647
they'll appear.
Then we'll collect 'em

13:02.649 --> 13:04.849
and put 'em in
our Team Treasure Chest.

13:04.851 --> 13:07.318
Yo ho, let's go.

13:10.122 --> 13:13.091
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys, away! </i>

13:13.093 --> 13:15.927
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

13:15.929 --> 13:17.295
<i>¶ Let's go </i>

13:17.297 --> 13:20.265
<i>¶ Heave ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

13:20.267 --> 13:23.134
<i>¶ Jake and the</i>
<i>Never Land Pirates ¶</i>

13:23.136 --> 13:25.470
<i>¶ And me </i>

13:27.907 --> 13:29.908
[Jake] Ahoy, Captain Hook.

13:29.910 --> 13:32.110
What is it, popinjay?

13:32.112 --> 13:33.711
We were just wondering
if you're riding

13:33.713 --> 13:35.446
in the Seahorse Saddle-Up.

13:35.448 --> 13:38.683
Not only am I riding
in said Saddle-Up,

13:38.685 --> 13:41.286
I will win it.

13:41.288 --> 13:44.055
It's always good
to think positive.

13:44.057 --> 13:46.391
- See you at Mermaid Lagoon.
- [bell ringing]

13:46.393 --> 13:49.160
Ta-ta.
Defeat you later.

13:50.729 --> 13:53.932
- [Jake] Ahoy, Marina.
- Ahoy, pirate friends.

13:53.934 --> 13:57.168
We're ready for the Seahorse
Saddle-Up Challenge.

13:57.170 --> 13:59.370
Here come
your seahorses now.

13:59.372 --> 14:02.240
- [whinnying]
- [chuffing]

14:02.242 --> 14:03.975
Hiya, Sea Flower.

14:03.977 --> 14:06.711
Rested and ready for
the Saddle-Up Challenge?

14:06.713 --> 14:07.979
[whinnying]

14:07.981 --> 14:09.380
Yee-haw!

14:09.382 --> 14:11.115
I'm ready to ride.

14:11.117 --> 14:13.551
[whinnying, chuffing]

14:13.553 --> 14:15.787
Yee-haw, me too.

14:15.789 --> 14:17.322
[whinnying]

14:17.324 --> 14:19.023
Izz, are you sure

14:19.025 --> 14:21.125
Sea Flower is up
for the challenge?

14:21.127 --> 14:23.628
She and I have been
practicing for weeks.

14:23.630 --> 14:25.096
She's ready.

14:25.098 --> 14:27.298
[Hook] The winner
has arrived.

14:27.300 --> 14:29.434
[deep whinnying]

14:29.436 --> 14:31.636
Whoa!

14:31.638 --> 14:34.672
That's no sea horse,
that's a machine.

14:34.674 --> 14:37.609
Check the official
rules, bird,

14:37.611 --> 14:42.780
and I think you'll find that
Steamy here is, well...

14:42.782 --> 14:44.015
...official.

14:44.017 --> 14:46.217
The rules say,
"Each seahorse

14:46.219 --> 14:47.485
must have the following:

14:47.487 --> 14:50.521
Number one:
a curled seahorse tail."

14:50.523 --> 14:52.957
Seahorse tail, check.

14:52.959 --> 14:56.094
"Number two:
pointed seahorse flippers."

14:56.096 --> 14:58.596
Seahorse flippers,
double check.

14:58.598 --> 15:01.966
"And number three:
a seahorse-y snout."

15:01.968 --> 15:04.369
Steamy has all three.

15:04.371 --> 15:07.171
I must be allowed
to compete...

15:07.173 --> 15:09.974
...and win.

15:09.976 --> 15:12.844
[loudly] And win.

15:12.846 --> 15:14.646
I said "Win!"
[echoing]

15:14.648 --> 15:17.115
Oh, oh.
That's the signal, boys.

15:17.117 --> 15:19.684
- [roaring]
- [all] Whoa!

15:19.686 --> 15:21.219
That's better.

15:21.221 --> 15:24.555
Riders, this is
the Saddle-Up course.

15:24.557 --> 15:27.158
First, you must jump
these floating nets

15:27.160 --> 15:28.660
piled with barrels.

15:28.662 --> 15:32.597
Then, you must zigzag
between capsized shipwrecks.

15:32.599 --> 15:35.700
Finally, you must each
grab a Golden Ring

15:35.702 --> 15:38.069
hanging over
the Golden Swirlpool.

15:38.071 --> 15:40.338
Everyone ride safely.

15:40.340 --> 15:43.041
Ready, set...

15:43.043 --> 15:44.008
...Giddy-up!

15:44.010 --> 15:46.544
[all] Go, seahorses, go!

15:49.882 --> 15:51.416
- Way-hey!
- Yee-haw!

15:51.418 --> 15:53.885
- All right!
- [Hook] Ha-ha!

15:53.887 --> 15:56.587
Farewell, popinjays!

15:56.589 --> 16:00.258
- [whinnying]
- It's OK, girl.

16:00.260 --> 16:04.429
<i>¶ There, there, girl,</i>
<i>it's gonna be OK ¶</i>

16:05.631 --> 16:07.165
<i>¶ You've worked so hard </i>

16:07.167 --> 16:09.968
<i>¶ I'm proud of you today </i>

16:11.170 --> 16:14.072
<i>¶ I know that</i>
<i>you can do it ¶</i>

16:14.074 --> 16:17.175
<i>¶ Let's give 'em all</i>
<i>a show ¶</i>

16:17.177 --> 16:22.613
<i>¶ Sea Flower,</i>
<i>giddy-up and go ¶</i>

16:22.615 --> 16:27.485
<i>¶ Sea Flower,</i>
<i>giddy-up and go ¶</i>

16:31.523 --> 16:33.091
[Hook laughing]

16:33.093 --> 16:36.160
The barrel challenge awaits.

16:36.162 --> 16:37.795
Faster, men!

16:37.797 --> 16:40.098
<i>Prepare to jump.</i>

16:40.100 --> 16:41.933
Did you hear something?

16:41.935 --> 16:43.568
Ready...

16:43.570 --> 16:45.069
...get set.

16:45.071 --> 16:46.671
Jump!

16:47.773 --> 16:51.409
Fie and fish sticks.
I'm stuck.

16:51.411 --> 16:53.978
Looks like we each get
to jump our own barrel pile.

16:53.980 --> 16:57.215
Giddy-up! Whoa!

16:58.117 --> 17:00.251
Whoo-hoo!

17:00.253 --> 17:01.519
[whinnying]

17:01.521 --> 17:03.187
Take it from me, girl.

17:03.189 --> 17:06.190
You can do it.

17:09.361 --> 17:12.163
- [whinnying]
- Way to go, Sea Flower!

17:12.165 --> 17:13.464
Atta girl.

17:13.466 --> 17:15.700
Come on,
there's more to jump.

17:19.705 --> 17:22.673
Uh, you need a little
help, Captain Hook?

17:22.675 --> 17:24.709
Never, puny pirate.

17:24.711 --> 17:27.678
OK, see ya'
at the finish line.

17:27.680 --> 17:30.815
Yay-hey.
We jumped the barrels

17:30.817 --> 17:32.850
and got three
gold doubloons.

17:32.852 --> 17:34.786
Let's grab 'em and go.

17:37.122 --> 17:39.891
- Whoa!
- It's awesome!

17:39.893 --> 17:41.392
Hang on tight, crew.

17:41.394 --> 17:44.162
Time to zigzag
through these wrecks.

17:45.664 --> 17:49.367
Ha-ha!
Zigzagging is for losers.

17:49.369 --> 17:52.870
I shall motor
beneath the wrecks.

17:52.872 --> 17:55.073
<i>Prepare to dive.</i>

17:55.075 --> 17:57.642
He wants cod fish
and fries.

17:57.644 --> 18:01.379
No, no, he said
prepare to dive.

18:08.787 --> 18:10.388
Turn left.

18:10.390 --> 18:12.623
<i>Turn left, I say.</i>

18:12.625 --> 18:14.692
- [thudding]
- Oops! Oh, dear.

18:14.694 --> 18:16.694
We hit something.

18:16.696 --> 18:18.663
Why, there's our Cap'n.

18:18.665 --> 18:21.732
- Hello.
- [garbled]

18:21.734 --> 18:25.136
I... I believe
he wants us to go up.

18:26.505 --> 18:28.406
[Jake] Yo ho, way to go.

18:28.408 --> 18:30.908
We all made it through
the shipwreck obstacle.

18:30.910 --> 18:33.277
And we got four more
gold doubloons.

18:33.279 --> 18:35.780
Let's grab 'em and go.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.515
But what about
Captain Hook?

18:37.517 --> 18:38.616
Where is he?

18:38.618 --> 18:40.718
He tried to pass
under the wrecks.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.854
And it sounds like
he came up...

18:42.856 --> 18:44.722
...inside of that one.

18:44.724 --> 18:47.391
Oh, no. We've gotta
help him get out.

18:47.393 --> 18:48.860
See these ropes?

18:48.862 --> 18:52.230
Maybe our seahorses
could pull the ship over

18:52.232 --> 18:54.098
and free Hook.

18:54.100 --> 18:56.534
- Sea horses, ho!
- Giddy-up.

18:56.536 --> 18:58.269
[whinnying]

18:58.271 --> 19:00.037
It's working, mateys.

19:00.039 --> 19:03.908
- [Cubby] Pull, pull!
- [Hook] I'm free?

19:03.910 --> 19:07.245
I'm free!
[laughing]

19:07.247 --> 19:09.213
You're welcome,
Captain Hook.

19:09.215 --> 19:12.216
Go, you infernal machine, go!

19:14.119 --> 19:15.820
[Izzy] Whoa, girl.

19:15.822 --> 19:19.690
Here we are.
The Golden Swirlpool.

19:19.692 --> 19:22.760
I can see the rings.
Let's go for it, crew.

19:22.762 --> 19:25.963
- Giddy-up
- [whinnying]

19:26.532 --> 19:28.533
Got it.

19:28.535 --> 19:30.067
My turn.

19:30.069 --> 19:31.569
[grunting] Whoa!

19:31.571 --> 19:34.472
Aw, coconuts.
I got one.

19:34.474 --> 19:37.909
OK, Sea Flower,
let's go.

19:39.011 --> 19:41.812
- [gasping]
- [whinnying]

19:41.814 --> 19:45.116
It's OK, girl.
Turn, Sea Flower.

19:45.118 --> 19:46.651
Atta girl.

19:46.653 --> 19:48.653
Here comes a ring.

19:48.655 --> 19:52.490
Yo ho, let's go!
Gotcha!

19:52.492 --> 19:55.593
Mateys, what happened
to your rings?

19:55.595 --> 19:58.329
- Huh?
- Ha-ha!

19:58.331 --> 20:02.200
I've snagged me own ring
and all three of yours.

20:02.202 --> 20:03.701
That's no fair, Hook.

20:03.703 --> 20:06.003
There's one ring
for each of us.

20:06.005 --> 20:07.305
Give 'em back.

20:07.307 --> 20:10.274
Oh, ho-ho.
I think not.

20:10.276 --> 20:13.644
Oh, no! Blast!

20:13.646 --> 20:17.481
Crew. Get me out
of this swirlpool.

20:17.483 --> 20:20.818
Aw, he thinks
we're super cool.

20:20.820 --> 20:23.921
Hear that? Hook's crew
is inside that thing.

20:23.923 --> 20:25.623
We've gotta save 'em.

20:25.625 --> 20:27.825
We can use this seaweed
like a rope.

20:27.827 --> 20:30.361
Hee-yaw!

20:31.363 --> 20:32.830
I gotcha, Hook.

20:32.832 --> 20:34.765
Current's too...

20:34.767 --> 20:35.833
...strong.

20:35.835 --> 20:37.935
Let's help, Sea Flower.

20:37.937 --> 20:40.638
Pull, pull!

20:40.640 --> 20:42.106
[Izzy] Pull!

20:42.108 --> 20:44.642
Yes.
Thanks to our seahorses,

20:44.644 --> 20:46.944
especially you,
Sea Flower,

20:46.946 --> 20:49.213
we saved Hook
and his crew.

20:49.215 --> 20:52.149
And we got three more
gold doubloons.

20:52.151 --> 20:54.619
Let's grab 'em and go.

20:54.621 --> 20:56.520
See you at
the finish line.

20:56.522 --> 20:59.123
- Giddy-up.

20:59.125 --> 21:02.293
Go, you confounded craft.

21:02.295 --> 21:05.329
Whatever is the hold-up
down there?

21:05.331 --> 21:08.699
[panting]
We can't move, Cap'n.

21:08.701 --> 21:12.003
We're plumb tuckered out.

21:12.005 --> 21:17.174
Ooh, why couldn't I have
ridden a real seahorsey?

21:18.710 --> 21:21.312
- Woo-hoo.
- Waves away!

21:21.314 --> 21:23.514
Congratulations, riders.

21:23.516 --> 21:25.983
You've completed
the Seahorse Saddle-Up.

21:25.985 --> 21:27.785
- All right.
- Yeah!

21:27.787 --> 21:28.919
Awesome.

21:28.921 --> 21:31.956
I am so proud of you,
Sea Flower.

21:31.958 --> 21:34.725
You really swam
like a champ today.

21:34.727 --> 21:36.294
[whinnying]

21:38.363 --> 21:40.564
Thanks for riding
in the Seahorse Saddle-Up

21:40.566 --> 21:42.033
with us, mateys.

21:42.035 --> 21:44.068
Now let's put
all our gold doubloons

21:44.070 --> 21:46.470
into our Team
Treasure Chest.

21:53.645 --> 21:55.946
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

21:55.948 --> 21:57.915

Yo-ho. For solving
Pirate Problems today,

we got ten gold doubloons.

22:23.276 --> 22:25.643
[Skully] Next year,
I'm gonna ride.

22:25.645 --> 22:29.380
So I better get
a little practice.

22:29.382 --> 22:32.383
Skully, you might need
more than a little practice.

22:32.385 --> 22:34.585
[all laughing]

22:37.956 --> 22:41.559
[Hook gasping] Why are we
not going anywhere?

22:41.561 --> 22:45.096
I want to move.
Move it, I say.

22:45.098 --> 22:48.232
[Smee struggling]
Trying, Cap'n.

22:48.234 --> 22:50.267
- Just have to get...
- [pounding]

22:50.269 --> 22:53.437
...this old engine
started again.

22:53.439 --> 22:57.641
Whoa! Smee!

22:57.643 --> 23:00.378
Sharky, Bones.

23:06.351 --> 23:09.553
