08:10.730 --> 08:11.799
SHE'S JUST, YOU KNOW, A BABY.
- NO, NO.

08:11.900 --> 08:13.720
I JUST DON'T WANNA
HAVE TO STRESS OUT

08:13.830 --> 08:14.694
ABOUT STUDYING SPANISH.
- OKAY.

08:14.800 --> 08:17.485
- ADIOS!
- ADIOS.

08:20.080 --> 08:22.048
- HEY, ADAM.

08:23.980 --> 08:26.972
- HI.
[heavy metal music]

08:27.090 --> 08:28.466
HONEY.
- YEAH?

08:28.570 --> 08:29.639
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
- YEAH.

08:29.750 --> 08:30.739
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- OH, IT'S JUST THIS BAND

08:30.850 --> 08:32.397
THAT CROSBY'S TRYING TO GET.

08:32.510 --> 08:35.263
IT FEELS LIKE NAILS BEING
DRIVEN DIRECTLY INTO MY HEAD.

08:35.370 --> 08:37.338
- OH. OKAY, DID YOU KNOW
HADDIE'S HAVING TROUBLE STUDYING

08:37.440 --> 08:38.714
BECAUSE OF THE BABY?
- YEAH, YEAH.

08:38.820 --> 08:40.708
SHE'S 17. SHE HAS HER OWN LIFE.
I THINK SHE'S JUST LOOKING--

08:40.830 --> 08:42.058
THINGS HAVE BEEN
A LITTLE CHAOTIC AROUND HERE.

08:42.170 --> 08:42.966
- WE NEED A FAMILY NIGHT.

08:43.070 --> 08:44.799
THIS FAMILY
IS COMPLETELY DISCONNECT ED.

08:44.900 --> 08:46.447
WE'RE NEVER HOME
AT THE SAME TIME,

08:46.560 --> 08:49.006
AND WHEN WE ARE, WE'RE ALL IN
DIFFERENT ROOMS, AND IT'S CRAZY.

08:49.110 --> 08:51.556
WE NEED A FAMILY FUN NIGHT.
- A FAMILY FUN NIGHT?

08:51.660 --> 08:53.139
- FUN NIGHT, DAMN IT!
- OKAY, OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

08:53.250 --> 08:54.285
YEAH.
- OKAY?

08:54.390 --> 08:55.550
- FAMILY FUN NIGHT, I'M IN.

08:55.670 --> 08:58.639
- LOOKIN' FORWARD TO IT.
[heavy metal mu5|c]

08:58.740 --> 09:01.288
[laughs]
GONNA HAVE FUN!

09:01.400 --> 09:03.561
[microwave beeps]

09:03.680 --> 09:07.013
[microwave hums]

09:07.130 --> 09:08.119
- HEY.

09:08.230 --> 09:09.606
- HI.

09:09.720 --> 09:12.268
- OH, UH, YOUR MOTHER
SET OUT A PLATE FOR YOU.

09:12.370 --> 09:13.576
YOU FOUND IT, HUH?
- YEAH.

09:13.690 --> 09:15.897
- YEAH.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.616
HEY, UH,

09:18.730 --> 09:23.315
SHE SAID THAT YOU WENT
AND SAW SETH, RIGHT?

09:23.420 --> 09:25.866
- YEAH.

09:25.970 --> 09:28.177
- SHE SAID YOU'RE GONNA GO
SEE HIM TOMORROW.

09:28.290 --> 09:32.420
THAT RIGHT? YOU'RE GONNA
KEEP SEEING THIS GUY?

09:32.530 --> 09:35.943
HOW MANY TIMES ARE YOU
GONNA GO SEE HIM?

09:36.050 --> 09:39.599
- I DON'T KNOW.

09:39.710 --> 09:42.292
- OH, YEAH.

09:42.400 --> 09:45.574
WELL, DON'T YOU THINK IT'S TIME
TO SET SOME BOUNDARIES, SARAH?

09:45.680 --> 09:47.921
I MEAN, THIS IS
HOW IT ALWAYS STARTS.

09:52.620 --> 09:56.033
- I AM SETTING BOUNDARIES.

10:10.290 --> 10:13.111
- OKAY, ROY ORBISON,
LET ME CHECK YOUR MIC LEVEL.

10:13.230 --> 10:14.299
SAY SOMETHING.

10:14.400 --> 10:15.571
- WHAT SHOULD I SAY?

10:15.680 --> 10:17.648
- UH,
MAYBE COUNT TO THREE?

10:17.750 --> 10:19.570
OR NO, NO. YOU KNOW WHAT?
TELL ME A JOKE.

10:19.680 --> 10:21.614
- KNOCK KNOCK.
- WHO'S THERE?

10:21.720 --> 10:23.403
- SAYS.

10:23.510 --> 10:24.613
- SAYS WHO?

10:24.720 --> 10:26.995
- SAYS ME, THAT'S WHO.
- [laughs]

10:27.100 --> 10:28.897
THAT'S A PRETTY--
IT'S A PRETTY GOOD JOKE.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.106
- DR. JOE TAUGHT IT TO ME.

10:32.210 --> 10:34.770
- WHEN'D HE TEACH YOU THAT?
- THIS MORNING.

10:34.870 --> 10:36.280
I USED TO THINK
HE WAS SCARY,

10:36.390 --> 10:37.596
BUT HE'S NOT.

10:37.700 --> 10:39.759
WE FILLED UP MY TRUCK
WITH LEGO BRICKS

10:39.880 --> 10:43.281
AND MADE IT DUMP ALL OVER
MY EWOK VILLAGE.

10:43.400 --> 10:44.879
IT WAS SO FUNNY.

10:48.570 --> 10:49.980
- YOU WANT TO SING?
- OKAY.

10:50.090 --> 10:52.843
MY NAM E'S JABBAR,
AND I GOT GOOD HAIR

10:55.620 --> 10:58.088
- MORNING, ZOE.
- WHAT'S UP? USUAL?

10:58.200 --> 10:59.519
- YES, THAT WOULD BE AWESOME.
HERE.

10:59.620 --> 11:00.689
- UH, RIGHT. OKAY.
- I'M READY.

11:00.790 --> 11:02.064
HOW ARE YOU?

11:02.170 --> 11:03.614
- UH, I'M FAT.
THANKS FOR ASKING.

11:03.730 --> 11:05.061
- YOU DON'T LOOK IT
AT ALL.

11:05.180 --> 11:06.727
- AND YOURSELF?

11:06.830 --> 11:09.003
- I'M WELL, THANK YOU.
- MM, THAT WASN'T BELIEVABLE.

11:09.110 --> 11:10.975
- WELL, I DO HAVE TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING, THOUGH,

11:11.080 --> 11:14.379
AND IT'S KIND OF AWKWARD,
'CAUSE IT'S ABOUT THE BABY.

11:14.500 --> 11:16.320
SO YOU WERE EATING SUSHI.
- I KNOW, SPICY TUNA ROLLS.

11:16.430 --> 11:17.351
SO GOOD.
- YEAH.

11:17.460 --> 11:20.770
UM, BUT YOU CAN'T DO THAT
WHEN YOU'RE PREGNANT.

11:20.880 --> 11:22.359
- WHAT, EAT LUNCH FOR BREAKFAST?
ILLEGAL.

11:22.470 --> 11:24.882
[laughs]
- EAT SUSHI.

11:26.680 --> 11:28.056
- AHH!

11:28.170 --> 11:30.957
- COOKED CRAB AND LOBSTER ARE
APPARENTLY OKAY IN MODERATION,

11:31.060 --> 11:32.641
BUT, LIKE, SUPER-
SUPER-MODERATION.

11:32.760 --> 11:33.829
THIS IS JUST
ACCORDING TO WHAT I GOOGLED.

11:33.930 --> 11:36.239
AND, UM, RAW FISH,
YOU KNOW,

11:36.350 --> 11:38.375
IT SHOULD BE
PROBABLY AVOIDED ENTIRELY,

11:38.490 --> 11:40.651
AND LOBSTER, TOO, AND THE CRAB,
JUST TO BE SAFE.

11:40.760 --> 11:42.830
- YOU GOOGLED
MY EATING HABITS?

11:42.940 --> 11:44.419
- WELL, I WANTED TO MAKE SURE
THAT I WAS RIGHT

11:44.530 --> 11:45.929
BEFORE I BROUGHT IT UP,
YOU KNOW?

11:46.050 --> 11:48.189
AND JOEL DIDN'T REMEMBER,
SO, YEAH, I GOOGLED IT, AND--

11:48.290 --> 11:50.633
- AND YOU TALKED TO YOUR HUSBAND
ABOUT WHAT I'M EATING.

11:50.740 --> 11:52.708
JOEL.

11:52.810 --> 11:53.845
- NO, HEY--
- JOEL THE FISH EXPERT.

11:53.950 --> 11:55.258
- THIS IS COMING OUT WRONG.

11:55.360 --> 11:57.362
OKAY, WE COULDN'T EVEN REMEMBER,
YOU KNOW,

11:57.470 --> 11:59.984
ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU
ARE OR AREN'T SUPPOSED TO EAT,

12:00.090 --> 12:01.261
SO WE DON'T BLAME YOU AT ALL
FOR NOT KNOWING.

12:01.370 --> 12:02.712
- [laughs]
OKAY.

12:02.820 --> 12:04.230
- AND "BLAME" IS THE WRONG WORD
THERE.

12:04.340 --> 12:05.682
- THANKS.
NEXT.

12:05.790 --> 12:06.779
- HI,
WHAT CAN I GET FOR YOU?

12:06.890 --> 12:09.097
- DECAF, PLEASE.

12:19.290 --> 12:21.383
- THANKS FOR COMIN' IN.
WE'LL GIVE YOU A CALL.

12:21.490 --> 12:23.458
- HEY.
HEY.

12:23.570 --> 12:25.709
POP, WHAT ARE YOU DOIN' HERE?
EVERYTHING OKAY?

12:25.810 --> 12:26.879
- CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

12:26.980 --> 12:28.663
- YEAH. JUST, UH,
JUST GIVE ME ONE MINUTE, OKAY?

12:28.780 --> 12:30.156
- BIANCA?
BIANCA.

12:30.260 --> 12:32.820
UH, JUST HEAD
RIGHT IN THERE, AND WE'LL--

12:32.920 --> 12:33.887
WE'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU.

12:33.990 --> 12:35.673
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?
- WELL,

12:35.780 --> 12:37.122
CAN WE GO...
- ARE YOU OKAY?

12:37.230 --> 12:38.709
- YEAH, KINDA.

12:38.820 --> 12:40.924
YOU KNOW,
SARAH HAS BEEN

12:41.030 --> 12:44.579
CALLIN' REHAB EVERY DAY
TO CHECK UP ON, UH, SETH.

12:44.690 --> 12:46.578
- MM-HMM.
- AND, UH,

12:46.690 --> 12:47.509
YESTERDAY
SHE WENT TO SEE HIM.

12:47.620 --> 12:49.064
- MM-HMM.

12:49.180 --> 12:52.695
- AND IT'S JUST...
SCARIN' THE HELL OUT OF ME, SON.

12:52.800 --> 12:54.620
- YEAH.

12:54.730 --> 12:58.382
I HEAR YOU, DAD.
THAT'S, UH...

12:58.500 --> 13:01.048
BUT YOU KNOW, IT'S HER BUSINESS.
WE GOTTA LET HER...

13:01.150 --> 13:02.845
DO HER THING HERE.
- NO, IT'S--

13:02.950 --> 13:04.702
NO, IT'S REALLY MY BUSINESS.

13:04.810 --> 13:07.461
IT'S FAMILY BUSINESS.

13:07.570 --> 13:08.912
YOU KNOW,
SHE'S MY DAUGHTER.

13:09.020 --> 13:10.647
YOU THINK ABOUT IT,
IF SOMETHING LIKE THIS

13:10.750 --> 13:12.638
WERE TO HAPPEN TO HADDIE.
YOU KNOW?

13:12.750 --> 13:15.548
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL?
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

13:15.650 --> 13:18.301
SON, IT JUST TEARS
YOUR HEART OUT, I'M TELLIN' YA.

13:18.410 --> 13:22.346
[sighs]
THIS GUY'S RESPONSIBLE...

13:22.450 --> 13:23.519
FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO HER.

13:23.630 --> 13:24.551
I MEAN, THAT'S WHY
SHE'S BACK HERE,

13:24.660 --> 13:27.549
AND SHE STARTS TO GET HER LIFE
BACK TOGETHER AGAIN,

13:27.660 --> 13:30.174
YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING
STARTS TO SEEM TO BE COPASETIC,

13:30.290 --> 13:35.489
AND THEN THIS GUY
SHOWS BACK UP AGAIN,

13:35.600 --> 13:36.840
AND, UM,

13:36.950 --> 13:41.774
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
I'M DOIN' ALL THE WRONG THINGS.

13:41.890 --> 13:43.676

13:43.780 --> 13:46.817
YEAH, I TALKED TO HER,
AND SHE JUST KINDA SHUT ME OUT.

13:46.920 --> 13:48.615
YOU KNOW.
- WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

13:48.720 --> 13:50.267
- WOULD YOU TALK TO HER?

13:54.280 --> 13:57.750
- I DON'T KNOW IF IT'LL DO
ANY GOOD, BUT I'LL TALK TO HER.

13:57.870 --> 13:59.178
- THANKS, ADAM.

13:59.280 --> 14:00.417
THANK YOU.
- ALL RIGHT, POP.

14:00.520 --> 14:01.862
[pat]

14:07.700 --> 14:08.837
- BOY, SOME OF THESE
APPLICATIONS

14:08.950 --> 14:10.326
ARE LOOKIN' PRETTY GRIM.
YOU KNOW.

14:10.430 --> 14:12.398
WE MIGHT WANT TO START
HAVIN' A SERIOUS CONVERSATION

14:12.500 --> 14:13.944
ABOUT UPPING
THE RECEPTIONIST'S SALARY.

14:14.060 --> 14:16.153
- YEAH. WHATEVER.

14:16.260 --> 14:17.158
- THIS ISN'T
A "YEAH, WHATEVER,"

14:17.270 --> 14:18.919
THIS IS A SERIOUS
BUSINESS DECISION, OKAY?

14:19.030 --> 14:20.054
- I'M GONNA HAVE TO
SAY SOMETHING TO JASMINE...

14:20.160 --> 14:20.979
- AND WE HAVE TO PULL MONEY
FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE...

14:21.100 --> 14:22.499
- BECAUSE WHAT SHE DID
THIS MORNING,

14:22.620 --> 14:23.882
- IS THE--YOU KNOW, IS--
- WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO

14:24.000 --> 14:24.887
PULL MONEY FROM SOMEPLACE ELSE--
- A TOTAL VIOLATION

14:25.000 --> 14:26.752
OF THE AGREEMENT WE HAVE.
- YOU'RE NOT EVEN

14:26.860 --> 14:27.929
LISTENING TO ME.
- WELL, MAYBE YOU'RE NOT

14:28.030 --> 14:28.928
LISTENING TO ME.

14:29.040 --> 14:30.439
THIS IS SERIOUS.
THIS IS A BIG DEAL.

14:30.550 --> 14:32.245
- ALL RIGHT.
- OKAY? WE HAD AN AGREEMENT.

14:32.350 --> 14:33.965
NO SIGNIFICANT OTHERS
AROUND JABBAR.

14:34.080 --> 14:35.627
- MM-HMM.
- SO WHY IS THERE A PEDIATRICIAN

14:35.730 --> 14:37.311
PLAYING TONKA TRUCKS WITH MY
SON--IT'S NOT COOL.

14:37.420 --> 14:39.069
- CROSBY,
YOU WERE 20 MINUTES EARLY.

14:39.180 --> 14:40.761
IF YOU'D GOTTEN THERE ON TIME,
HE COULD HAVE BEEN GONE.

14:40.880 --> 14:41.835
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU

14:41.950 --> 14:43.451
TO EVER LOOK AT IT
FROM MY POINT OF VIEW?

14:43.570 --> 14:45.288
YOU ALWAYS GOTTA GO
STRAIGHT TO JASMINE.

14:45.400 --> 14:46.321
- I'M TRYIN' TO LOOK AT
THE WHOLE PICTURE, OKAY?

14:46.430 --> 14:47.636
I GET IT, OKAY?

14:47.740 --> 14:49.184
YOU GUYS ARE SHARING CUSTODY,
AND THAT'S TOUGH.

14:49.300 --> 14:51.393
AND I'M JUST SAYING
THAT SHE WAS PROBABLY JUST

14:51.510 --> 14:52.841
DOIN' THE BEST SHE COULD
IN AN AWKWARD SITUATION.

14:52.960 --> 14:54.882
[phone rings]
- HOLD ON A SEC.

14:54.990 --> 14:55.911
- YOU KNOW, IF I WERE LATE,
THAT'S WHAT YOU'D BE

14:56.030 --> 14:56.815
YELLIN' AT ME ABOUT.
- HEY, HONEY.

14:56.930 --> 14:58.477
- IS THAT KRISTINA?
- HEY--YES.

14:58.580 --> 15:00.195
- RUN THE SITUATION BY HER.
I GUARANTEE SHE SAYS IT'S BOGUS.

15:00.310 --> 15:01.095
- I'M NOT GONNA--
HI, HOLD ON, HONEY.

15:01.210 --> 15:02.165
- I WAS TOLD YOU
WERE READY FOR ME?

15:02.280 --> 15:03.167
- UH, DOTTIE?
- YEAH, HI.

15:03.280 --> 15:04.304
- HI, JUST PLEASE
TAKE A SEAT.

15:04.420 --> 15:05.819
I'M GONNA BE BACK HERE
IN A MINUTE.

15:05.930 --> 15:07.795
MY BROTHER'S GONNA START
THE INTERVIEW, OKAY?

15:07.900 --> 15:08.821
- HI. HI, I'M DOTTIE.
HERE'S MY RESUME.

15:08.940 --> 15:10.931
- OH. UM,

15:11.040 --> 15:13.076
I'M GONNA BE
COMPLETELY HONEST WITH YOU,

15:13.180 --> 15:15.239
MY BROTHER USUALLY
HANDLES THE INTERVIEW STUFF,

15:15.360 --> 15:17.908
SO I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE
WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO DO.

15:18.020 --> 15:23.469
- WELL, YOU COULD JUST ASK ME
SOME QUESTIONS.

15:23.570 --> 15:24.707
- OKAY. YEAH, UM,

15:24.820 --> 15:26.367
ALL RIGHT, UH,
HERE'S A QUESTION.

15:26.470 --> 15:28.950
LET'S SAY, HYPOTH ETICALLY,
YOU SHARE CUSTODY

15:29.060 --> 15:31.813
OF A SIX-YEAR-OLD
WITH YOUR EX-FIANCE.

15:31.930 --> 15:34.194
HOW DO YOU HANDLE THAT?

15:34.310 --> 15:35.823
- LISTEN,
I THOUGHT OF AN ACTIVITY

15:35.930 --> 15:37.158
THAT WE CAN
ALL DO AS A FAMILY.

15:37.280 --> 15:38.065
- [on phone] FAMILY FUN NIGHT,
RIGHT.

15:38.170 --> 15:39.341
- YOU KNOW,
IT HAS TO BE REALLY FUN,

15:39.450 --> 15:40.348
OR ELSE NO ONE'S
GONNA WANT TO GO.

15:40.450 --> 15:42.827
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY TO BOWLING?
- I SAY

15:42.940 --> 15:44.999
MAX HATES BOWLING.
- SINCE WHEN?

15:45.110 --> 15:47.146
- WELL, SINCE CHRIS BARNES
WON THE PBA TOUR.

15:47.250 --> 15:48.865
- WHO'S CHRIS--THAT DOESN'T EVEN
MAKE ANY SENSE.

15:48.980 --> 15:49.935
I DON'T--
- YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT.

15:50.050 --> 15:50.903
MAYBE WE SHOULD TRY
TO REASON WITH HIM.

15:51.010 --> 15:52.523
- OKAY. OKAY,
WHAT ABOUT THE ARCADE?

15:52.640 --> 15:53.834
HE LOVES THE ARCADE.
- YEAH, HE LOVES IT,

15:53.950 --> 15:55.019
BUT HADDIE WOULD KILL US.
- [sighs]

15:55.120 --> 15:56.940
OKAY.
HOW ABOUT--

15:57.050 --> 15:58.745
HOW 'BOUT ICE SKATING?
- COME ON.

15:58.850 --> 16:00.158
- ICE SKATING'S SO FUN.
- KRISTINA, A NEWBORN ON ICE?

16:00.260 --> 16:01.648
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
- YOU KNOW WHAT, HONEY,

16:01.750 --> 16:03.433
YOU'RE NOT COMING UP WITH
ANY BRILLIANT IDEAS YOURSELF--

16:03.540 --> 16:04.404
- HONEY, LISTEN,
I'M GONNA DO THE BEST THAT I CAN

16:04.510 --> 16:05.716
TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING,
BUT I JUST--

16:05.820 --> 16:07.572
I FEEL LIKE MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT,
YOU KNOW, MAYBE IT'S JUST

16:07.690 --> 16:09.920
TOO SOON FOR US TO FIND
AN ACTIVITY THAT ALL OF US

16:10.030 --> 16:11.167
CAN ENJOY TOGETHER,
WE SHOULD JUST WAIT.

16:11.280 --> 16:12.998
- NO, HONEY, HADDIE'S
GONNA GO OFF TO COLLEGE,

16:13.110 --> 16:15.203
AND WE HAVE A TINY LITTLE WINDOW
RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

16:15.310 --> 16:17.699
I WANT TO DO SOMETHING AS
A FAMILY, SO THINK OF SOMETHING,

16:17.800 --> 16:20.212
BECAUSE THIS IS HAPPENING,
OKAY?

16:20.320 --> 16:21.628
[beep]

16:22.910 --> 16:25.834
[knocking at door]

16:25.950 --> 16:27.759
- HI.
- SARAH.

16:27.880 --> 16:29.211
- HI.
- HI, YOU'RE EARLY.

16:29.330 --> 16:30.467
- YEAH.

16:30.570 --> 16:32.674
- [chuckles] UM, FOR OUR DATE,
YOU'RE LIKE--

16:32.780 --> 16:33.769
I'M NOT QUITE READY YET.

16:33.880 --> 16:36.462
- I CAN'T GO OUT
WITH YOU TONIGHT.

16:36.580 --> 16:38.787
I HAVE TO CANCEL.
I'M SO SORRY.

16:38.890 --> 16:40.232
IT'S BECAUSE OF SETH.

16:40.340 --> 16:42.888
HE'S GOT SOME COUNSELING
SESSION TONIGHT

16:43.000 --> 16:44.752
HE'S ASKED ME TO COME TO.

16:44.860 --> 16:46.543
I JUST THINK I SHOULD GO.

16:46.660 --> 16:49.959
- OKAY.
- HE'S IN SUCH A FRAGILE PLACE.

16:50.070 --> 16:51.344
I--I COULDN'T SAY NO.

16:51.450 --> 16:53.338
- OKAY.
- I FEEL SO BAD,

16:53.460 --> 16:55.837
I ALMOST THOUGHT OF MAKING UP
A STORY, YOU KNOW,

16:55.940 --> 16:58.317
MY CAT GOT SICK, OR SOMETHING,
AND THEN I THOUGHT,

16:58.430 --> 16:59.874
"WHAT AM I DOING?
THIS IS RIDICULOUS." I--

16:59.980 --> 17:01.049
_ THAT WOULD'VE BEEN A BAD LINE,
ANYWAY,

17:01.150 --> 17:02.424
'CAUSE I KNOW
YOU DON'T HAVE A CAT,

17:02.530 --> 17:03.428
SO WOULD'VE FIGURED IT OUT
REAL QUICK.

17:03.530 --> 17:04.394
- NO, I WOULD'VE HAD TO
GET A CAT,

17:04.500 --> 17:05.944
AND THEN POISON IT
FOR IT TO BE SICK.

17:06.050 --> 17:07.460
- [laughs]

17:07.570 --> 17:10.915
WOW, ALL RIGHT, WELL, HOW DO--
HOW ARE YOU FEELING ABOUT THAT?

17:11.030 --> 17:13.260
I MEAN,
COUNSELING SESSION WITH--

17:13.370 --> 17:18.194
- I DON'T KNOW, I FEEL--IT'S
CRAZY, I--I'M WORRIED ABOUT HIM,

17:18.310 --> 17:20.756
AND I'M, YOU KNOW,
I'M WORRIED ABOUT..

17:20.860 --> 17:23.897
YOU, AND SO I JUST FEEL
OVERWHELMED, I GUESS.

17:24.000 --> 17:24.864
I FEEL BAD.
- NO, YOU'RE FINE.

17:24.970 --> 17:25.937
YOU DON'T HAVE TO--
- I FEEL BAD.

17:26.040 --> 17:28.929
TO WORRY ABOUT ME.
I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS

17:29.040 --> 17:31.144
YOUR LIFE RIGHT NOW, AND...
- MM-HMM.

17:31.250 --> 17:33.070
- YOU NEVER HAVE TO MAKE UP
A STORY FOR ME.

17:33.190 --> 17:34.760
IT WAS BETTER TO TELL ME.

17:34.880 --> 17:37.144
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT
DINNER, AND I HAD A SURPRISE,

17:37.260 --> 17:38.420
BUT--
- NO.

17:38.540 --> 17:44.809
- UM, BUT, UH,
I HOPE TONIGHT GOES, UM...

17:44.920 --> 17:47.229
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT ADJECT IVE I'M LOOKIN' FOR.

17:47.340 --> 17:51.959
- I HOPE TONIGHT GOES...TOO.

17:52.070 --> 17:57.793
- UM, AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT...

17:57.900 --> 18:01.722
THAT YOU CAN'T KEEP
CANCELING ON ME LAST MINUTE.

18:01.830 --> 18:03.969
THAT'S...

18:04.080 --> 18:06.048
THAT'S JUST NOT GONNA BE
OKAY WITH ME.

18:06.150 --> 18:07.731
[laughs]

18:10.840 --> 18:13.354
- WELL, DID YOU SAY IT
CONVERSATIONALLY, OR LECTURE-Y?

18:13.470 --> 18:14.698
- [on phone] I TRIED TO KEEP IT
CONVERSATIONAL,

18:14.810 --> 18:17.017
BUT WORDS JUST KEPT
POURING OUT OF MY MOUTH.

18:17.130 --> 18:19.951
- JULES, I KNOW I WASN'T THERE,
BUT I HAVE A STRONG FEELING

18:20.060 --> 18:20.981
YOU'RE OVER-REACTING.
YOU KNOW,

18:21.100 --> 18:22.909
ZOE JUST PROBABLY
NEEDED TIME TO PROCESS.

18:23.030 --> 18:23.928
HAVE YOU SEEN HER SINCE?

18:24.030 --> 18:24.849
- NO, I'VE BEEN HIDING
IN MY OFFICE.

18:24.960 --> 18:27.269
I HAVEN'T PEED IN LIKE
SEVEN HOURS.

18:27.380 --> 18:28.711
- OH, AS LONG AS
YOU'RE NOT OVER-REACTING.

18:28.830 --> 18:30.024
- JOEL, SHE HAD NO IDEA
THAT THERE ARE THINGS

18:30.140 --> 18:32.893
THAT YOU CAN'T EAT--I DON'T
THINK SHE HAS ANYONE IN HER LIFE

18:33.000 --> 18:34.865
TO TELL HER THESE THINGS,
TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS.

18:34.970 --> 18:36.585
- WELL, THAT'S WHY YOU HAD TO
SAY SOMETHING, HON.

18:36.700 --> 18:38.930
- SHE WAS SO HURT.
SHE WAS SO EMBARRASSED.

18:39.040 --> 18:41.008
- I KNOW YOU FEEL BAD.
- OH!

18:41.120 --> 18:43.566
JOEL, WHAT IF SHE
CHANGES HER MIND?

18:43.670 --> 18:45.763
- JULIA, IT'S JUST--
DEEP BREATHS, HONEY.

18:45.880 --> 18:47.734
- OKAY.

18:47.850 --> 18:49.909
[breathes out]

18:50.020 --> 18:52.193
ALL RIGHT.
I'M ACTING CRAZY.

18:52.300 --> 18:54.530
I JUST DON'T WANT TO
SCREW IT UP.

18:54.650 --> 18:56.333
AND I REALLY, REALLY
HAVE TO PEE.

18:56.440 --> 18:58.021
- JULIA.
- YEAH.

18:58.130 --> 19:00.052
- SHE NEEDED TO HEAR
WHAT YOU SAID.

19:00.170 --> 19:03.754
- YEAH.

19:03.860 --> 19:06.033
- YOU KNOW, I STILL GOT
SOME PRETTY BIG ISSUES

19:06.140 --> 19:08.370
WITH SOME OF THE THINGS
THAT YOU GUYS

19:08.490 --> 19:12.039
ARE TEACHIN' US AROUND HERE,
YOU KNOW?

19:12.150 --> 19:15.790
I MEAN, I WAS IN GROUP
LAST WEEK, AND, UH,

19:15.910 --> 19:18.947
WE STARTED OUT JUST LIKE ALWAYS,
TRYIN' TO ONE-UP EACH OTHER

19:19.050 --> 19:21.359
WITH, YOU KNOW, ALL
THE HORRIBLE THINGS WE'VE DONE,

19:21.470 --> 19:26.396
AND IT'S MY TURN, AND I GIVE
MY LAUNDRY LIST OF...

19:26.510 --> 19:29.536
FORGOTTEN BIRTHDAYS, AND,
UH, YOU KNOW,

19:29.650 --> 19:32.858
ALL THE TIMES
I DIDN'T COME HOME, AND...

19:32.960 --> 19:35.758
YOU KNOW, I--I EVEN SOLD MY
KID'S BASEBALL CARDS ONCE

19:35.860 --> 19:38.067
FOR DRUG MONEY.

19:38.170 --> 19:39.376
I MEAN,
YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT.

19:39.480 --> 19:40.412
- SARAH?

19:40.520 --> 19:41.919
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT
HOW THAT MAKES YOU FEEL?

19:42.040 --> 19:43.894
- NO.
[clears throat]

19:44.010 --> 19:45.454
I'LL JUST LISTEN.
- GO ON.

19:45.560 --> 19:46.959
- I DON'T KNOW, ANYWAY,
AI-TER GROUP

19:47.080 --> 19:48.900
WE DO THIS
HAND-HOLDING DEAL

19:49.010 --> 19:51.183
WHERE WE RECITE
ONE OF THESE REHAB MANTRAS.

19:51.290 --> 19:52.143
- "WE WILL NOT
REGRET THE PAST,

19:52.260 --> 19:53.978
NOR WISH TO
SHUT THE DOOR ON IT."

19:54.080 --> 19:55.524
- YEAH, THAT'S THE ONE.
- MMM.

19:55.640 --> 19:57.847
- SO I GO BACK TO MY ROOM,
AND MY ROOMMATE, BOBBY,

19:57.950 --> 20:03.502
HE'S NOT THERE, BUT THE MAIL
HAD COME, BECAUSE THERE'S A...

20:03.610 --> 20:05.783
CARD PROPPED UP
ON HIS NIGHTSTAND.

20:05.890 --> 20:10.065
IT'S ONE OF THESE
CRAYON--CRAYON, YOU KNOW,

20:10.170 --> 20:14.994
OBVIOUSLY HIS KID MADE IT,
AND, UH,

20:15.110 --> 20:17.271
YOU KNOW, I SH--

20:17.380 --> 20:21.760
I SHOULDN'T HAVE, BUT
I OPENED IT, AND, UH, IT SAID,

20:21.870 --> 20:25.692
"I MISS YOU, DADDY.
GET WELL SOON, DADDY."

20:25.810 --> 20:27.072
AND I LOOKED AT
MY NIGHTSTAND,

20:27.190 --> 20:30.523
I'VE GOT A COUPLE GUITAR PICKS
THERE AND SOME LOOSE CHANGE,

20:30.640 --> 20:33.222
AND I KNOW I DON'T DESERVE
ANYTHING ELSE,

20:33.330 --> 20:39.018
I MEAN, I KNOW YOU GOTTA EARN
A CARD LIKE THE ONE BOBBY'S GOT,

20:39.130 --> 20:42.054
BUT IT MADE ME START THINKIN'
ABOUT MY KIDS, AMBER AND DREW,

20:42.170 --> 20:43.546
ESPECIALLY AMBER.

20:43.650 --> 20:47.757
UM, WHEN SHE WAS BOBBY'S
KID'S AGE.

20:47.860 --> 20:48.781
DO YOU REMEMBER,

20:48.900 --> 20:52.279
AI-TER HER SEVENTH
BIRTHDAY PARTY, THAT NIGHT,

20:52.380 --> 20:54.245
WHEN YOU FINALLY GOT HER
TO GO TO SLEEP?

20:54.350 --> 20:56.454
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHAT HAPPENED?

20:56.560 --> 21:01.111
- IT'S THE FIRST TIME
I ASKED YOU TO GO TO REHAB.

21:01.220 --> 21:04.087
- THAT'S RIGHT.

21:04.190 --> 21:05.703
AND I SHOULDA GONE.

21:10.780 --> 21:13.021
"WE WILL NOT REGRET
THE PAST,

21:13.130 --> 21:14.779
NOR WISH TO SHUT THE DOOR
ON IT."

21:14.890 --> 21:16.471
NO WAY, MAN.

21:16.580 --> 21:19.401
UH-UH, DOC,
I'M NOT BUYIN' THAT.

21:19.510 --> 21:21.922
'CAUSE UNTIL THE DAY I DIE,

21:22.030 --> 21:25.340
I'M GONNA REGRET NOT LISTENING
TO MY WIFE THAT NIGHT,

21:25.450 --> 21:29.386
BECAUSE IF I DID,
I'D HAVE A DIFFERENT LIFE.

21:29.490 --> 21:31.867
I'D HAVE A BETTER LIFE.

21:34.530 --> 21:38.705
MAYBE WE'D STILL
BE A FAMILY.

21:48.610 --> 21:49.508
- DID YOU WANT MORE?
- YEAH.

21:49.610 --> 21:50.474
- IS THIS TACKY?
IS THIS WRONG,

21:50.580 --> 21:52.093
THAT I'M GUZZLING WINE

21:52.200 --> 21:53.576
AS I TALK ABOUT
VISITING REHAB?

21:53.690 --> 21:55.442
- I DON'T THINK IT IS
AT ALL.

21:55.550 --> 21:56.278
ANYWAY, TELL ME
ABOUT THE SESSION.

21:56.380 --> 21:58.029
- OH, SO HE SAYS,

21:58.140 --> 22:01.758
IF HE'D GOTTEN SOBER YEARS AGO,
MAYBE WE'D STILL BE A FAMILY.

22:01.870 --> 22:04.338
YOU KNOW WHAT? I NEED, LIKE,
WHISKEY, OR SOMETHING HARDER.

22:04.460 --> 22:05.597
- HE SAID THAT?
- YEAH.

22:05.700 --> 22:07.144
I MEAN, I CAN'T STOP
THINKING ABOUT IT,

22:07.250 --> 22:08.103
'CAUSE THAT'S
WHAT I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT.

22:08.220 --> 22:10.563
MAYBE WE WOULD.
BUT HE DIDN'T.

22:10.670 --> 22:11.944
HE DIDN'T GET SOBER,

22:12.050 --> 22:16.805
AND HE DID TERRIBLE THINGS,
AND FOR A LONG TIME I THOUGHT

22:16.920 --> 22:20.629
I WOULD NEVER
LOVE ANYBODY AGAIN.

22:20.750 --> 22:22.502
- DOES MARK KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THIS?

22:22.610 --> 22:23.952
- YOU KNOW, SOME.
I JUST--I DON'T WANT

22:24.060 --> 22:26.301
TO TALK ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME,
WHICH IS HARD,

22:26.410 --> 22:28.298
BECAUSE IT'S ALL
I'M THINKING ABOUT ALL THE TIME.

22:28.410 --> 22:29.820
SO IT MAKES ME
A BAD GIRLFRIEND.

22:29.930 --> 22:31.067
- YOU'RE
AN AMAZING EX-WIFE, THOUGH.

22:31.170 --> 22:32.341
- MMM.
- NO.

22:32.450 --> 22:34.509
- HMM.
- NO? WELL, SORRY.

22:34.620 --> 22:37.965
I MEAN THAT TRULY, YOU'RE--
YOU'RE BEING SUPPORTIVE OF SETH,

22:38.080 --> 22:39.581
IT'S--
IT'S NICE.

22:39.700 --> 22:42.009
- BUT IS IT CRAZY
TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF SETH?

22:42.110 --> 22:43.907
WHY AM I
SUPPORTIVE OF SETH?

22:44.010 --> 22:47.491
CAN HE REALLY STAY SOBER?

22:47.600 --> 22:49.113
- I DO HAVE VODKA
IN THE FREEZER.

22:49.220 --> 22:50.391
- AWESOME.
- OKAY.

22:50.500 --> 22:52.604
- [baby babbles]
- OH.

22:52.710 --> 22:55.122
[laughs]

22:55.230 --> 22:56.151
GOO GOO GOO GOO GOO.

22:56.270 --> 22:57.885
[babylaughs]
-OOH.OOH.

22:57.990 --> 23:00.675
- HONEY, I HAVE FIGURED OUT
THE FAMILY-FUN-NIGHT PUZZLE.

23:00.790 --> 23:02.303
[baby co
os
- OKAY? ]

23:02.410 --> 23:03.923
- WE'VE GOT A NEWBORN.
- YES?

23:04.030 --> 23:05.713
- AN 11-YEAR-OLD
WITH ASPERGER'S AND A TEENAGER,

23:05.830 --> 23:07.206
BUT ONE THING
WE CAN ALL ENJOY...

23:07.310 --> 23:08.481
- IS?
- TWO WORDS.

23:08.590 --> 23:09.409
- OKAY.
- MAYBE ONE WORD, HYPHENATED.

23:09.520 --> 23:12.387
- OKAY, WHAT--WHAT IS IT?
- MINI GOLF.

23:12.490 --> 23:14.594
- MINI GOLF.
- MINI GOLF.

23:14.700 --> 23:15.553
- I LIKE IT.
- YOU LIKE THAT?

23:15.670 --> 23:16.523
- YEAH.
- COME ON.

23:16.630 --> 23:17.528
- HEY.
- BOOM!

23:17.630 --> 23:20.144
- WOW, GOOD IDEA.

23:20.260 --> 23:21.761
MINI GOLF.
- MINI GOLF.

23:21.880 --> 23:24.531
- I MEAN, IS HE GETTING OUT
SOON, OR WHAT?

23:24.640 --> 23:27.256
- WELL, THEY KEEP HIM
FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME,

23:27.370 --> 23:28.564
AND THEN WE'LL SEE,
YOU KNOW?

23:28.680 --> 23:30.841
I MEAN, HE MIGHT GO THROUGH--
- WELL, OKAY, I GUESS--

23:30.960 --> 23:32.916
DO YOU THINK HE'S
GONNA GET BETTER, OR NOT?

23:33.030 --> 23:35.498
- I MEAN, IT'S NOT A DISEASE.
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE THE FLU,

23:35.620 --> 23:36.996
HE'S NOT GONNA GET BETTER...
- I'M SORRY.

23:37.100 --> 23:38.897
- BUT MAYBE HE'LL STOP
MAKING BAD CHOICES, AND THAT'S--

23:39.000 --> 23:40.615
- WELL, ACTUALLY,
IT IS A DISEASE.

23:40.720 --> 23:42.688
- WELL, SURE, BUT IT'S ALSO
MAKING CHOICES, SO--

23:42.800 --> 23:44.347
- IT IS ALSO MAKING CHOICES.
HE MADE THE CHOICE

23:44.450 --> 23:45.314
TO GO INTO REHAB,
HE'S DOING WELL.

23:45.420 --> 23:46.387
- GREAT,
I'M JUST SAYING.

23:46.490 --> 23:47.559
- AND I JUST WANTED TO
TELL YOU GUYS THAT.

23:47.660 --> 23:49.104
I'VE BEEN WORRIED ABOUT HIM.

23:49.220 --> 23:51.359
I FIGURED YOU GUYS
MIGHT BE WORRIED ABOUT HIM,

23:51.460 --> 23:54.873
AND I'M JUST LETTING YOU KNOW
THAT SO FAR HE'S DOING OKAY,

23:54.980 --> 23:56.424
AND THOUGHT YOU WOULD
LIKE TO KNOW,

23:56.530 --> 23:58.350
'CAUSE I'M GONNA
GO SEE HIM LATER.

23:58.470 --> 24:00.609
- GREAT.

24:03.090 --> 24:05.229
- WELL, TELL HIM I SAID HI.
[chuckles]

24:08.610 --> 24:10.430
- YEAH, ME, TOO,
I MEAN...

24:10.550 --> 24:13.997
DEFINITELY.

24:14.100 --> 24:16.614
- THAT'LL MAKE HIM FEEL
REALLY GOOD, YOU GUYS.

24:28.840 --> 24:30.876
- I MICROMANAGE.
IT'S WHAT I DO.

24:30.980 --> 24:33.323
- OH, MY GOD.
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

24:33.430 --> 24:35.705
LOOK, I GOT THE MESSAGE
LOUD AND CLEAR YESTERDAY, OKAY?

24:35.810 --> 24:37.323
I'M NOT GONNA FEED YOUR BABY
RAW FISH.

24:37.440 --> 24:39.431
YOU GOT IT.
ALL RIGHT, BOSS?

24:39.540 --> 24:40.848
THAN KS.
- ZOE,

24:40.960 --> 24:42.643
I WOULD'VE HAD THAT CONVERSATION
WITH YOU,

24:42.750 --> 24:45.958
REGARDLESS OF OUR ARRANGEMENT,
OKAY?

24:46.070 --> 24:47.958
I DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY'S
TELLING YOU THESE THINGS,

24:48.070 --> 24:49.446
AND IT'S JUST SOMETHING
THAT YOU NEEDED TO KNOW.

24:49.550 --> 24:52.587
SO, UM, HERE.
- WHAT IS THAT?

24:52.690 --> 24:55.386
- IT IS CHICKEN
AND ROASTED POTATOES,

24:55.490 --> 24:57.242
AND A LITTLE KALE.

24:57.350 --> 24:58.214
- WHAT IS KALE?

24:58.320 --> 24:59.526
- IT IS A GREEN, LEAFY
VEGETABLE,

24:59.630 --> 25:01.074
AND JOEL SAYS
IT'S A SUPER FOOD.

25:01.180 --> 25:04.707
IT'S REALLY TRENDY RIGHT NOW,
AND IT TASTES GOOD.

25:04.810 --> 25:07.358
- IS THIS SOME KIND OF BRIBE,
OR SOMETHING?

25:07.470 --> 25:10.701
- NOPE. YOU DESERVE TO HAVE
SOMEONE MAKE YOU A NICE LUNCH.

25:10.810 --> 25:13.984
PREGNANCY IS EXHAUSTING, AND
WHAT YOU'RE DOING, EMOTIONALLY,

25:14.090 --> 25:15.466
IS--
ANYWAY,

25:15.580 --> 25:20.199
OKAY, I'M DONE, SO...

25:20.310 --> 25:21.686
YOU KNOW, YOU ALSO DESERVE
TO HAVE SOMEONE MAKE YOU

25:21.790 --> 25:27.035
A NICE DINNER, SO IF YOU WANT TO
COME OVER TOMORROW NIGHT...

25:30.590 --> 25:32.649
UM, ALSO, PLASTIC
CAN'T GO IN THE MICROWAVE,

25:32.770 --> 25:33.930
'CAUSE IT RELEASES THE CHEMICALS
INTO THE FOOD--

25:34.040 --> 25:35.519
- OH, MY GOD,
ARE YOU FOR REAL?

25:35.630 --> 25:36.699
- YOU KNEW THAT ONE.
GOOD. OKAY.

25:36.810 --> 25:39.187
[laughs]
GOING NOW.

25:52.510 --> 25:53.408
[knocking at door]

25:53.510 --> 25:54.545
- WHO IS IT?

25:54.650 --> 25:55.617
[knocking]

25:55.720 --> 25:57.449
WHO IS IT?
- IT'S CROSBY.

25:57.550 --> 25:58.926
- DOOR'S OPEN.

25:59.040 --> 26:01.270
[knocking]

26:05.010 --> 26:06.272
DOOR'S OPEN,
DIDN'T YOU HEAR ME?

26:06.390 --> 26:08.904
- WELL, I DON'T WANT TO SURPRISE
YOU. GOD KNOWS WHO'S IN HERE.

26:09.010 --> 26:10.978
- I'M ALONE.
WHAT'S UP?

26:11.080 --> 26:13.116
- JABBAR TOLD ME HE SPENT
THE WHOLE DAY PLAYING TRUCKS

26:13.220 --> 26:16.109
WITH DR. JOE.
- ALL DAY? IT WAS 15 MINUTES.

26:16.220 --> 26:17.426
- OKAY, WELL,
EVEN IF IT WERE FIVE MINUTES.

26:17.540 --> 26:18.984
WE HAD A DEAL,
AND YOU BROKE IT.

26:19.090 --> 26:21.365
- THE DEAL WAS THAT YOU
DROP HIM OFF AT 7:30.

26:21.470 --> 26:23.267
- OH, OKAY, I'LL JUST IGNORE
ALL THE TIMES YOU BITCHED AT ME

26:23.370 --> 26:25.258
FOR BEING LATE. NOW I'M EARLY,
AND I'M IN TROUBLE.

26:25.370 --> 26:27.258
MAYBE YOU SHOULD PUT A CLOCK
OUT IN FRONT OF THE DOOR,

26:27.370 --> 26:28.849
AND I CAN JUST WATCH IT TICK,
AND THEN NOT--

26:28.960 --> 26:30.131
- YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU'RE
BEING IRRATIONAL RIGHT NOW.

26:30.240 --> 26:31.855
- I DON'T WANT THAT GUY
AROUND MY KID, PERIOD!

26:31.960 --> 26:33.723
- OKAY, NOW YOU'RE NOT
BEING IRRATIONAL...

26:33.830 --> 26:35.104
- DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?
- YOU'RE BEING INSANE.

26:35.210 --> 26:36.586
IT WAS A SHORT VISIT.
NO ONE GOT HURT.

26:36.690 --> 26:37.896
- I DID!

26:38.010 --> 26:38.931
I GOT HURT.

26:39.040 --> 26:41.247
I HAVE TO LISTEN TO JABBAR
TALK ABOUT HOW FUN IT IS

26:41.350 --> 26:43.409
HANGING WITH DR. JOE?
HOW HILARIOUS IT WAS

26:43.530 --> 26:45.498
WHEN HE DUMPED HIS BLOCKS
ON HIS EWOKS?

26:45.600 --> 26:48.979
I DON'T WANT TO BE REPLACED.

26:49.090 --> 26:51.604
HE'S MY SON.

26:54.060 --> 26:56.631
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
WE HAD A DEAL.

26:56.750 --> 26:59.913
I SHOULDN'T LET JOE STAY.

27:02.270 --> 27:03.259
- OKAY.

27:03.380 --> 27:05.473
- OKAY.

27:05.580 --> 27:08.344
- THANK YOU.

27:09.420 --> 27:11.650
- [sighs]

27:15.250 --> 27:16.274
- HEY.

27:16.390 --> 27:18.244
- HI.

27:18.360 --> 27:20.555
- UH, NOTHING.
_ 50--

27:20.670 --> 27:22.422
- SORRY, JUST ONE SECOND.
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

27:22.530 --> 27:23.519
I WAS JUST RETURNING
THIS TOOLBOX.

27:23.640 --> 27:24.777
- UH-HUH.
- YEAH, I JUST BORROWED

27:24.880 --> 27:26.154
SOME TOOLS FOR DAD,
WE HAD SOME STUFF AT THE STUDIO

27:26.260 --> 27:27.568
THAT WAS BROKEN,
AND I HAD TO FIX IT, SO--

27:27.680 --> 27:28.362
- YOU NEEDED TOOLS.
- YUP.

27:28.470 --> 27:29.607
- YEAH.
- SO HOW'S IT GOIN'?

27:29.710 --> 27:31.507
- OH, IT'S TERRIBLE.
I WRITE SOMETHING

27:31.610 --> 27:33.749
AND I LIKE IT AT NIGHT, AND
THEN I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING,

27:33.850 --> 27:35.715
AND IT'S--
I THINK IT'S SO STUPID.

27:35.820 --> 27:37.333
- YEAH.
- I GUESS THAT'S NORMAL.

27:37.440 --> 27:40.375
- YEAH, WRITING'S HARD,
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE--

27:40.480 --> 27:42.516
YOU'RE PROBABLY DISTRACT ED.

27:42.620 --> 27:45.441
WITH SETH BEIN' IN REHAB,
AND ALL. RIGHT?

27:45.560 --> 27:47.482
HOW'S THAT GOIN'?
- [laughs]

27:47.590 --> 27:49.899
THIS IS AN AMBUSH.

27:50.010 --> 27:51.762
- IT'S NOT AN AMBUSH.
- THERE AREN'T EVEN REALLY TOOLS

27:51.870 --> 27:52.791
IN THAT BOX, ARE THEY?
- COME ON, SARAH.

27:52.910 --> 27:53.729
[tools clatter]
- IT'S LIKE--

27:53.840 --> 27:55.660
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

27:55.770 --> 27:57.249
DAD SENT YOU.

27:57.360 --> 27:58.452
RIGHT?

27:58.570 --> 27:59.776
YEAH, DAD SENT ME.
- YEAH.

27:59.880 --> 28:01.984
- LOOK, HE'S A MEDDLER,
HE'S A PAIN IN THE ASS, OKAY,

28:02.090 --> 28:03.819
BUT HIS HEART'S IN THE RIGHT
PLACE. HE'S WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

28:03.920 --> 28:06.707
- THAT'S FINE. JUST TELL HIM--
JUST TO STAY OUT OF IT.

28:06.820 --> 28:09.220
- I DON'T THINK HE CAN.

28:09.340 --> 28:11.126
HE'S WORRIED ABOUT YOU, SARAH,
AND SO AM I.

28:11.240 --> 28:13.060
- OKAY, WELL,

28:13.170 --> 28:14.569
I GOT IT.

28:14.690 --> 28:17.204
- ALL RIGHT. [clears throat]
- OH, BOY.

28:17.310 --> 28:18.413
- I'M GONNA SAY SOMETHING
TO YOU, OKAY?

28:18.520 --> 28:20.249
THIS ISN'T COMIN' FROM DAD.
THIS IS COMIN' FROM ME.

28:20.350 --> 28:22.068
YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL.

28:22.180 --> 28:23.932
WE'VE BEEN DOWN THIS ROAD
WITH SETH BEFORE,

28:24.040 --> 28:27.385
AND WE'VE SEEN
WHERE IT LEADS, SO...

28:27.490 --> 28:32.427
- THANK YOU, BUT WEHAVEN'T BEEN
DOWN THIS ROAD BEFORE WITH SETH.

28:32.530 --> 28:35.283
IHAVE BEEN DOWN THIS ROAD,
MANY, MANY TIMES,

28:35.400 --> 28:39.018
WHICH IS HOW I KNOW, THIS TIME
HE IS CAPABLE OF CHANGE.

28:39.130 --> 28:42.645
- I BELIEVE THAT YOU
REALLY WANT THAT TO BE TRUE,

28:42.750 --> 28:46.095
BUT I DON'T THINK SETH IS EVER
GONNA CHANGE THE WAY THAT YOU

28:46.200 --> 28:48.441
ARE HOPING THAT HE WILL
OR EXPECTING HIM TO.

28:48.550 --> 28:49.949
- HOW DO YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M HOPING OR EXPECTING?

28:50.070 --> 28:52.061
I JUST WANT SOMETHING BETTER
TO HAPPEN.

28:52.170 --> 28:54.889
I--IT'S LIKE SAYING, YOU KNOW,
GIVE UP ON SARAH,

28:55.000 --> 28:57.173
SHE HASN'T DONE ANYTHING YET
WITH HER LIFE,

28:57.280 --> 29:00.488
GIVE UP ON AMBER, SHE HAD
THAT ROUGH PATCH LAST YEAR, I--

29:00.600 --> 29:03.239
HOW CAN I GIVE UP?
I CAN'T GIVE UP.

29:03.360 --> 29:06.011
HE IS CAPABLE OF CHANGE.
I BELIEVE THAT. I DO.

29:06.120 --> 29:08.327
- OKAY.

29:08.430 --> 29:12.150
ALL RIGHT.

29:12.260 --> 29:15.195
JUST DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU
GET HURT, THAT'S ALL.

29:15.300 --> 29:17.609
DIDN'T MEAN TO OFFEND YOU.
JUST TRYIN' TO LOOK OUT FOR YOU,

29:17.720 --> 29:19.096
OKAY?

29:26.830 --> 29:27.990

PROBABLY MAKE THE PREVIEWS.

30:06.010 --> 30:07.454
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

30:07.560 --> 30:10.597

30:41.110 --> 30:42.520
- MAX, THIS IS YOUR SEAT NOW,
OKAY?

30:42.630 --> 30:43.858
- THE PERSON IN THE BACK
HAS THE HIGHEST CHANCE OF DYING

30:43.980 --> 30:45.288
IN A CAR CRASH.
- NO, NO, NO, THAT'S NOT--

30:45.390 --> 30:46.698

30:46.810 --> 30:48.664

31:07.650 --> 31:09.470
- MAX, IT'S NOT ABOUT
GETTING A VIDEO GAME,

31:09.590 --> 31:11.376
IT'S ABOUT GETTING TO SPEND TIME
WITH YOUR FAMILY.

31:11.490 --> 31:12.798
- THAT'S RIGHT.
HONEY, THIS IS WAY MORE FUN

31:12.900 --> 31:14.276
THAN BOWLING.

31:14.380 --> 31:15.768
- LET HIM GO BOWLING.
- YEAH, IT'S MINI GOLF!

31:15.870 --> 31:17.030

31:18.700 --> 31:20.042

31:20.150 --> 31:21.629
IT'S UNFAIR TO YOUR SISTERS,

31:26.290 --> 31:27.496
WE MADE A DECISION
TO GO PLAY MINI GOLF--

31:27.600 --> 31:28.919
- WHY DON'T WE JUST GO BOWLING?
- WE'RE NOT EVEN

31:29.020 --> 31:29.873
GOING TO MINI-GOLF.

31:29.990 --> 31:31.742
- OH, MAN, I KNEW
THIS WAS A BAD IDEA.

31:31.850 --> 31:33.078
HADDIE, THAT DOESN'T HELP,
HADDIE.

31:33.200 --> 31:34.292

31:34.400 --> 31:35.469
I DON'T KNOW WHY
EVERYBODY'S LIKE--

31:35.580 --> 31:37.400

[tires screech]

31:43.760 --> 31:44.613

31:44.730 --> 31:46.379
- IF NOBODY WANTS TO GO,
THEN WE'RE NOT GONNA GO.

31:46.490 --> 31:47.866
THIS IS STUPID. I MEAN,
NOBODY WANTS TO DO THIS.

31:47.970 --> 31:50.586
- HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.
[overlapping chatter]

31:50.700 --> 31:52.144
- ALL YOU'VE BEEN DOING
IS WHINING AND COMPLAINING.

31:52.250 --> 31:53.797
"I DON'T WANT TO GO,
I WANT TO DO THIS--"

31:53.910 --> 31:55.070
JUST TAKE A BREATH

THAT DAY, THOUGH?

32:52.660 --> 32:54.821
