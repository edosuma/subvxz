00:09.920 --> 00:11.680
Keep digging, girls.

00:11.680 --> 00:14.080
Your time capsule will be there somewhere.

00:17.160 --> 00:19.640
You know, if you'd hit her
just a little bit harder,

00:19.640 --> 00:21.200
you could've finished off the job.

00:22.200 --> 00:24.040
Oi, Sister, quick question.

00:24.040 --> 00:26.920
Do Catholic ghosts respond
to Buddhist exorcisms?

00:26.920 --> 00:28.680
Just for future reference.

00:28.680 --> 00:31.880
How about, "Quick question,
how are you, Sister Barbica?"

00:31.880 --> 00:33.640
You've been so caught up
with your petty dramas,

00:33.640 --> 00:35.280
you didn't even notice that there was

00:35.280 --> 00:38.320
a whole other human being
living here on the campus.

00:38.320 --> 00:41.800
With all due respect, Sister B... Barbica,

00:41.800 --> 00:44.840
your quarters are out of bounds
and old habits die hard.

00:44.840 --> 00:46.640
Yes, very convenient.

00:47.200 --> 00:49.760
You see, this is why I've been
avoiding you for so long.

00:49.760 --> 00:51.840
Do you know, when the waters rose,
I prayed?

00:51.840 --> 00:55.360
"Dear God, anyone but this cohort."

00:55.360 --> 00:58.640
I'd have taken 2012
and the butterfly hairclip uprising,

00:58.640 --> 01:01.680
or 1996 and the nose piercing hospitalizations.

01:01.680 --> 01:03.160
Heck, I survived 2016,

01:03.160 --> 01:06.520
the non-stop blasting
of that very sad Billie Eilish girl.

01:06.520 --> 01:08.280
- But you...
- We what?

01:10.720 --> 01:15.280
You were the biggest bunch of bitches
I ever taught.

01:15.400 --> 01:18.040
- Language.
- And the names you called me.

01:18.040 --> 01:20.280
- Sister Bitchface?
- Mother Inferior?

01:20.400 --> 01:21.880
The Immaculate Infection?

01:21.880 --> 01:23.960
- Shit a Bricky.
- Bicky Likes to Lickie.

01:23.960 --> 01:27.520
- Oh, oh, oh, Sister Bicky no Dicky.
- Fuck a Bicky, Suck a Tittie.

01:27.520 --> 01:29.400
- Nun Who Can't Get None.

01:29.400 --> 01:31.360
- Stop!

01:31.360 --> 01:32.840
Just stop this, please.

01:33.160 --> 01:34.440
That's quite enough.

01:37.400 --> 01:40.280
Shit. We made the friggin' teacher cry.

01:46.680 --> 01:49.440
What happened to this class?

01:50.640 --> 01:52.960
You ten were always troublemakers,

01:53.520 --> 01:56.240
but shaving people's heads,
cutting off toes,

01:56.240 --> 01:58.840
withholding perfectly good toilets
from each other?

01:58.840 --> 01:59.760
Yeah, Genevieve.

01:59.760 --> 02:02.000
What? That's the least worst thing
on that list.

02:02.440 --> 02:04.320
It's pretty fucking selfish, though.

02:04.320 --> 02:05.920
- Stop!

02:06.760 --> 02:08.040
Another week

02:08.160 --> 02:11.800
and I fear that someone might have
been killed if I hadn't stepped in.

02:11.800 --> 02:15.680
Sorry to break it to you, Sister,
but it only took us one day.

02:15.680 --> 02:17.600
Sandy's been dead for weeks.

02:17.720 --> 02:19.240
What the...

02:19.440 --> 02:22.880
I know Sandy was
a first-class whinger, but...

02:22.880 --> 02:25.160
this is despicable, girls, even for you.

02:26.120 --> 02:30.520
Now, come and get your letters
to your future selves.

02:30.520 --> 02:32.720
And reflect on who you've become.

02:38.720 --> 02:41.600
Who wants to read theirs out loud?

02:44.680 --> 02:45.880
I'll do it.

02:45.880 --> 02:47.320
Okay, um...

02:50.520 --> 02:53.960
"Dear future Phoebe, congrats.

02:54.480 --> 02:57.360
"You're probably going
to top the state." Correct.

02:57.880 --> 02:59.920
"You skipped the formal to study

03:00.880 --> 03:04.560
"and you blew off school camp
to take extra tutoring.

03:05.560 --> 03:09.320
"On the eve of graduating,
you have no friends.

03:09.320 --> 03:10.720
"I hope it was worth it."

03:12.720 --> 03:17.680
Um, yeah, so I know the last few months
have been, like, really fucked-up.

03:17.680 --> 03:20.600
But I actually, weirdly...

03:22.040 --> 03:24.960
enjoyed getting to know you all, so...

03:26.000 --> 03:26.840
Yeah.

03:31.560 --> 03:33.440
"Dear Amelia." Oop.

03:33.440 --> 03:35.360
I was always a bit off-task,
wasn't I, Sister?

03:35.360 --> 03:39.920
"I don't know what your fucking problem is
or why you won't answer my calls,

03:39.920 --> 03:41.920
"but I want my Billabong skirt back."

03:43.160 --> 03:44.640
And I'm still waiting, bitch.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.520
"Dear Future Genevieve,

03:46.520 --> 03:50.000
"or should I say,
third-ever female Prime Minister?"

03:50.000 --> 03:52.840
What the hell?
I wasn't even backing myself for second.

03:53.320 --> 03:56.480
"By this point, you'll have
a Cert III in beauty therapy

03:56.480 --> 03:58.680
"and will be working
as a nail technician."

04:01.000 --> 04:02.160
Life.

04:02.160 --> 04:04.680
Who knew I'd be trading manicures
for medicine?

04:05.320 --> 04:06.440
Not me.

04:06.720 --> 04:11.040
Aw, this is a love letter to Mitch,
and a shit-ton of stussies.

04:18.640 --> 04:22.680
And the balls are the legs and the shaft's
playing violin with its little arms.

04:22.680 --> 04:24.360
I mean, obviously,
it's not anatomically correct,

04:24.480 --> 04:28.040
but it's still an accurate depiction
of my future anyway, so...

04:28.800 --> 04:30.040
What you got?

04:30.800 --> 04:32.480
Uh...

04:32.480 --> 04:36.160
Mine was just a vag making beer, so...

04:36.600 --> 04:39.160
But the drawing's not as good.
Yeah.

04:40.320 --> 04:43.160
So, who do we have left?

04:43.160 --> 04:45.640
- Oh, Amelia.
- Oh, uh, no, I don't have a letter.

04:45.640 --> 04:46.800
I'd left school by then.

04:46.800 --> 04:48.600
Of course.
I'd forgotten about your mother.

04:48.600 --> 04:49.800
I'm very sorry, dear.

04:50.520 --> 04:51.520
Well, girls,

04:52.240 --> 04:54.160
a time of reflection...

04:54.160 --> 04:57.120
Amelia, what's she talking about?

05:03.360 --> 05:04.360
Amelia?

05:05.880 --> 05:06.920
Uh...

05:09.920 --> 05:10.920
My mum died.

05:10.920 --> 05:14.040
That's why I had to leave school early.

05:16.640 --> 05:17.720
What?

05:17.720 --> 05:20.480
<i>-</i> [Saskia] <i>Tuck shop, anyone?
-</i> [Zoe] <i>Mels, you want to come?</i>

05:20.480 --> 05:22.080
If you don't mind waiting...

05:22.080 --> 05:24.080
Zo-Zo. Come on, let's go.

05:24.760 --> 05:26.240
Amelia, please come.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.040
-  I really need to...
-  Zo-Zo.

05:30.080 --> 05:32.960
She, um... She took her own life.

05:37.640 --> 05:40.560
Jesus, Zoe. It's... It's okay. It was...

05:40.800 --> 05:42.720
-  <i>Come on, let's go.</i>

05:42.720 --> 05:43.640
Zo-Zo.

05:44.400 --> 05:45.880
Amelia, please come.

05:46.720 --> 05:48.600
We haven't hung out in ages.

05:49.280 --> 05:51.720
Uh, no. Go without me.

05:51.720 --> 05:53.400
I need to see Danny.

05:57.120 --> 05:58.040
I'm sorry.

05:58.560 --> 06:00.120
Way to make it about you, Zoe.

06:00.680 --> 06:01.520
Typical.

06:04.080 --> 06:06.280
I'm so sorry, dear. I thought they knew.

06:06.280 --> 06:07.440
No, it's...

06:08.040 --> 06:08.960
It's okay.

06:19.480 --> 06:20.640
I didn't know.

06:20.920 --> 06:23.440
- If I'd have known...
- It's okay. It was a long time ago.

06:24.400 --> 06:26.280
Why do I always fuck
everything up so badly?

06:26.280 --> 06:29.320
You know, like, if I hadn't
pussied out at the reunion,

06:29.320 --> 06:30.640
then none of you would be stuck here

06:30.640 --> 06:32.680
and Saskia wouldn't be dredging
up years of trauma.

06:32.680 --> 06:34.160
And Genevieve wouldn't be constipated.

06:34.160 --> 06:36.040
And you wouldn't have to tell us that...

06:36.040 --> 06:38.080
that your fucking mum died, and I'm...

06:38.880 --> 06:42.080
I mean, they're laughing about
fucking Billabong skirts, you know?

06:42.560 --> 06:44.120
This whole time...

06:44.120 --> 06:48.440
This whole time I had convinced myself
it was you who'd fucked me over, you know?

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
What is it? Say it. I deserve it.

06:58.040 --> 07:02.560
I just chased after you to console you
about something that happened to me,

07:02.560 --> 07:04.720
and suddenly I can see you clearly,

07:04.720 --> 07:07.240
the way I would
if I didn't know you, and...

07:08.480 --> 07:10.320
Zoe, we don't have to do this.

07:10.320 --> 07:13.760
You know, we're not... We're not friends.

07:15.160 --> 07:16.680
Of course, we're friends.

07:16.680 --> 07:19.840
- I mean, I know it's been a bumpy ride.
- Let's just say we did keep in touch.

07:20.200 --> 07:22.040
Let's say we grab dinner every few months.

07:22.760 --> 07:24.040
What do you and I talk about, Zoe?

07:24.040 --> 07:26.400
Um, our lives.

07:26.400 --> 07:28.320
But our lives are so different.

07:29.440 --> 07:31.720
We are so different, Zoe.

07:32.840 --> 07:34.920
It never would have held up after school.

07:35.480 --> 07:38.000
- Regardless of whether I left or not.
- Amelia,

07:39.240 --> 07:41.960
I know I fucked up, okay?
I should have kept calling you,

07:41.960 --> 07:44.960
but I promise you if I'd have known,
it never would have gone this way.

07:46.320 --> 07:47.720
Yeah, it would've.

07:48.880 --> 07:51.840
Maybe not right away, but... it would've.

08:01.160 --> 08:04.520
I'm sorry I had a secret toilet.

08:04.520 --> 08:07.400
No, I'm sorry that I extorted you all.

08:07.400 --> 08:10.760
I'm sorry that I mixed chalk and water
and said it was miso soup.

08:10.760 --> 08:12.680
But you all seemed to kind of like it...

08:12.680 --> 08:14.320
I'm sorry that I told you all
I was a doctor

08:14.320 --> 08:16.560
when I'm actually really
a nail technician.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.120
What?

08:18.400 --> 08:20.400
You're not a doctor?

08:20.400 --> 08:21.760
You really fooled me.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.080
Right, guys?

08:23.080 --> 08:24.560
- Uh...
- Mmm...

08:26.400 --> 08:28.480
It's okay, Renee. We kind of knew.

08:29.160 --> 08:30.320
What?

08:30.600 --> 08:33.480
Yeah, like when you said
formaldehyde was pickle juice,

08:33.480 --> 08:35.040
it was a dead giveaway.

08:35.160 --> 08:37.520
And when you performed
"routine" Pap smears on us

08:37.520 --> 08:40.000
and called the speculum a "spatula"?

08:40.000 --> 08:43.040
And what lab were you
sending the swabs to?

08:43.040 --> 08:45.200
'Cause all of us was just
in a whole bundle.

08:45.200 --> 08:46.520
It didn't make sense.

08:46.640 --> 08:49.360
I, uh, I reckon I cottoned on when you...

08:50.760 --> 08:53.520
chopped off my whole entire toe.

08:53.640 --> 08:55.120
Yeah, I'm sorry.

08:55.760 --> 08:56.880
I'm sorry that I lied.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.480
And, Teresa, I can't apologize enough.

08:59.480 --> 09:00.520
I'm sorry, too.

09:02.880 --> 09:03.880
To all of you.

09:04.480 --> 09:05.840
I'm sorry, are we just...

09:05.840 --> 09:07.080
Pep... Genevieve.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.880
...skating over this now?

09:09.000 --> 09:11.640
I know that I made your life hell,
and I enjoyed it.

09:14.520 --> 09:16.440
There was just this desperation,

09:16.440 --> 09:18.840
this naivety to you
that I really resented.

09:18.840 --> 09:20.720
Okay, is this an apology, or...

09:20.720 --> 09:24.400
But really, I was just jealous.

09:25.640 --> 09:29.000
Because you've got this
incredible strength of character.

09:29.760 --> 09:31.240
You really know who you are.

09:31.640 --> 09:34.080
And I'm sorry that I ever
tried to change that.

09:45.040 --> 09:45.880
Oh.

09:49.280 --> 09:50.240
Apology accepted.

09:56.400 --> 09:58.160
There's too much estrogen in here.

09:58.160 --> 10:00.760
I think we need to air this room out
and go and eat.

10:02.480 --> 10:03.320
Come on.

10:14.240 --> 10:16.400
Anything you'd like to
apologize for, Bicky?

10:17.040 --> 10:18.320
Oh, please.

10:19.240 --> 10:23.120
A few detentions and you millennials
are ready to file a class-action lawsuit.

10:23.120 --> 10:26.040
You were disciplined, Saskia,
for uniform infractions

10:26.040 --> 10:27.760
and smoking behind the assembly hall,

10:27.880 --> 10:31.480
and late assignments, to say nothing
of that nasty bullying streak of yours.

10:31.480 --> 10:32.520
What did you say?

10:32.520 --> 10:35.120
You were a bully.
Quite the most prolific I ever saw.

10:35.120 --> 10:37.880
No, no, you said smoking
behind the assembly hall.

10:40.640 --> 10:41.880
Sometimes,

10:42.720 --> 10:44.440
girls like you, Saskia,

10:45.200 --> 10:47.400
detention is for your own good.
I always had my reasons.

10:56.880 --> 10:58.760
Excuse me.

11:01.240 --> 11:02.760
- Done with that?
- Um...

11:03.240 --> 11:04.440
What are you doing?

11:04.840 --> 11:06.760
I am making a grand gesture.

11:07.840 --> 11:12.800
Zo, I don't want to be rude, but
thought about just apologizing to Amelia?

11:12.800 --> 11:15.400
Yeah, I'm really going to take friend
advice from the girl who had none.

11:15.400 --> 11:18.840
Oh, hey, Zoe. That's not on.
We're being nice to each other now.

11:20.200 --> 11:21.200
Sorry, mate.

11:23.440 --> 11:25.800
Teresa, this fish is,
it's really delicious.

11:26.920 --> 11:29.720
The dressing is, it's really tangy.

11:31.400 --> 11:32.960
I didn't make a dressing today.

11:33.840 --> 11:35.040
But thanks, Sas.

11:35.680 --> 11:39.880
Sorry, I know we're being, um,
like, positive and stuff,

11:39.880 --> 11:43.240
but I actually feel a bit funny.

11:47.280 --> 11:49.080
Mmm, it's fine.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.040
- Oh, God.

11:55.040 --> 11:56.760
Oh, no, no, no, no.

11:57.200 --> 12:00.000
- I've got the mouth sweats too.

12:00.720 --> 12:01.880
- I don't want to...

12:02.880 --> 12:03.960
Guys, don't look at each other.

12:06.600 --> 12:09.080
Resist...

12:10.960 --> 12:12.400
Resist the vomiting.

12:12.400 --> 12:15.240
Guys, I think it might be the fish.

12:15.880 --> 12:18.360
Your sick fish.

12:36.640 --> 12:37.800
Okay.

12:38.360 --> 12:39.720
Let's try it.

12:40.320 --> 12:41.440
Let's have dinner.

12:42.040 --> 12:43.040
See if it holds up.

12:44.640 --> 12:46.800
Zoe, please stop.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.920
Well, you have to eat, don't you?

12:48.920 --> 12:51.200
So you may as well do it with me.

12:51.680 --> 12:53.840
Now, red or white?

12:54.920 --> 12:57.040
Napkins, not wine. There's no wine.

12:58.640 --> 13:00.280
The only reason that you are
gripping on to this

13:00.280 --> 13:03.280
is because we're stuck here
and it feels bigger than it is.

13:04.640 --> 13:06.160
Okay, then, um,

13:06.160 --> 13:10.080
can you just tell me, if our friendship
was really that meaningless to you,

13:10.800 --> 13:12.440
why did you come to the reunion?

13:13.200 --> 13:14.560
For the hors d'oeuvres, mostly.

13:17.120 --> 13:19.360
Look, Zoe, wouldn't you know best
that just because

13:19.360 --> 13:22.280
two people shared something
doesn't mean it always lasts?

13:25.640 --> 13:26.760
Wow!

13:27.440 --> 13:30.440
All right, then, message fucking received.

13:32.200 --> 13:33.400
Jesus Christ!

13:34.640 --> 13:36.360
Fucked if I'm gonna stay down here
in the thunderdome.

13:36.360 --> 13:37.320
No, Zoe...

13:37.320 --> 13:39.640
No, it's fine.
You don't want to be friends, whatever.

13:39.640 --> 13:42.400
I just, I don't know why
you need to bring my parents into this.

13:42.400 --> 13:45.640
Fine, I'll have dinner with you, fine.
Just don't touch any of the metal.

13:45.640 --> 13:47.440
Whole place is live, you dickhead!

13:52.480 --> 13:53.720
Okay.

13:56.200 --> 13:57.280
Red or white?

13:58.360 --> 13:59.600
- Oh.

13:59.600 --> 14:01.960
The sea is riddled with death and disease.

14:01.960 --> 14:04.240
What kind of idiot eats the fish?

14:04.960 --> 14:06.800
Is this the end of time, Sister?

14:07.120 --> 14:08.960
Has the rapture finally come for us?

14:08.960 --> 14:12.320
No, you silly girl, it's just
climate change and food poisoning.

14:13.480 --> 14:14.720
Renee, dear.

14:15.240 --> 14:16.160
Oh.

14:16.680 --> 14:18.760
The girls are cracking temperatures of 39.
What should I do?

14:18.760 --> 14:20.360
I'm not a doctor, Sister.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.640
Oh, yes, pardon me. It's been a big day.

14:22.640 --> 14:24.280
I've lost track of which girls
aren't doctors

14:24.280 --> 14:26.080
and who's been murdered and whatnot.

14:30.960 --> 14:33.720
Of course, no one believed
I was a doctor, Phoebe.

14:34.160 --> 14:38.440
Like, no one ever
expects big things from me.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.840
Good medicine is kindness.

14:50.040 --> 14:50.920
Hmm?

14:51.480 --> 14:53.600
Yeah, so you don't have
that little bit of paper,

14:54.440 --> 14:55.680
but guess what?

14:55.680 --> 14:56.760
What?

14:57.120 --> 14:59.480
- You make people feel better.

15:01.360 --> 15:02.960
You're a good friend, Phoebs.

15:06.240 --> 15:07.440
How is there more?

15:32.240 --> 15:36.400
So, how confident are we
that the rubber tires of the ute

15:36.400 --> 15:38.400
will protect us
from the electrical charge?

15:38.400 --> 15:40.360
Well, it's been about 20 minutes, so

15:41.120 --> 15:43.800
I think you can touch
all the metal you want now.

15:43.800 --> 15:46.240
In fact, you can even go.

15:47.600 --> 15:49.520
No, I think I better play it safe.

15:49.520 --> 15:51.000
In fact, I would feel
a lot more comfortable

15:51.000 --> 15:53.040
if you would at least
take a gumboot and a glove.

15:54.360 --> 15:55.360
No?

15:56.520 --> 15:57.520
All righty.

15:58.320 --> 15:59.520
So...

16:01.000 --> 16:02.200
How's the farm?

16:03.320 --> 16:05.760
Good harvest this year?

16:06.840 --> 16:08.320
Who do you supply peanuts to?

16:09.080 --> 16:12.400
Supermarkets or the little packets
on airplanes or what?

16:13.240 --> 16:14.600
Peanut butter factories.

16:17.360 --> 16:19.440
Peanut butter is made of peanuts.

16:20.840 --> 16:24.520
Oh, my God. I swear to you, I've never
even thought about it like that before.

16:24.520 --> 16:25.680
That's crazy.

16:25.680 --> 16:27.640
See, if we'd have stayed in touch,
I would have known that.

16:27.640 --> 16:29.400
Zoe, don't pretend this is interesting.

16:34.800 --> 16:38.040
I can't imagine
what you went through. But...

16:39.120 --> 16:42.360
I don't really understand
why you didn't tell me, Amelia.

16:42.360 --> 16:44.840
That peanut butter was
made out of peanuts?

16:44.840 --> 16:45.840
That's my bad.

16:49.720 --> 16:51.160
We didn't really tell anyone.

16:53.360 --> 16:55.960
Danny still thinks
that she died of a heart attack.

16:58.720 --> 16:59.800
Whoa.

17:02.080 --> 17:04.560
So, do you know what was wrong? Like...

17:06.840 --> 17:08.800
- Was she diagnosed?

17:10.080 --> 17:11.160
Sorry.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.320
I really want to know
the answer to that question. I just...

17:20.480 --> 17:23.160
- I think it might be the fish.
- Don't say "fish."

17:24.040 --> 17:26.440
So, what was I? A BFF for now?

17:26.440 --> 17:27.960
I just wanted more friends.

17:30.200 --> 17:32.080
Do you guys have a spare bucket?

17:32.080 --> 17:34.560
We can't even share this one,
let alone give it to you, F.L.

17:34.960 --> 17:37.440
And some of us are just
one-bucket women, okay?

17:37.440 --> 17:38.720
Do not start.

17:38.720 --> 17:41.880
When you only have one bucket,
it means you truly appreciate it.

17:41.880 --> 17:42.880
What is happening?

17:42.880 --> 17:45.920
Maybe one bucket relies on the other
bucket to get her wasted all the time.

17:45.920 --> 17:47.800
Okay, I've lost the thread
on the bucket metaphor.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.240
Are we the bucket
or is our friendship the bucket?

17:50.240 --> 17:51.280
Megan...

17:52.960 --> 17:54.240
You're an alcoholic.

17:56.520 --> 17:58.200
Where the hell did that come from?

17:58.800 --> 18:01.520
I saw you lick wine
off the chapel floor yesterday.

18:02.400 --> 18:05.240
And all we've done for weeks
is try to get fucked up, and I...

18:06.760 --> 18:08.320
I don't want to do it anymore.

18:14.400 --> 18:18.000
Forgettable Laura, looks like you
found yourself a new bucket buddy.

18:23.240 --> 18:24.880
Careful. It leaks.

18:27.760 --> 18:28.880
Zoe, you need to go.

18:28.880 --> 18:30.680
I cannot do this while you are here.

18:30.680 --> 18:34.160
What? You want me to go out there
into the third coming?

18:34.160 --> 18:35.080
What?

18:35.080 --> 18:37.080
The night the Poco came
was the second coming,

18:37.200 --> 18:38.800
so this is the third coming.

18:38.920 --> 18:41.320
- It's basic maths.
- Whatever. I'll go then.

18:41.320 --> 18:42.680
What? Are you serious?

18:42.680 --> 18:43.680
Yes, okay?

18:43.680 --> 18:46.160
I'm like one of those animals
that goes out into the woods to die, okay?

18:46.160 --> 18:47.160
So just let me go.

18:47.160 --> 18:49.800
No, please. Please. It's dangerous.
You're gonna get electrocuted.

18:49.920 --> 18:51.680
Oh, God, you're dramatic.

18:53.760 --> 18:55.080
Oh, my God.

18:55.680 --> 18:57.080
Are you okay?

18:57.400 --> 18:58.880
- You okay?

19:00.720 --> 19:02.320
Is this a bad time to say,
"I told you so"?

19:07.760 --> 19:09.640
You just shat yourself, didn't you?

19:13.160 --> 19:17.880
Mate, I shat myself,
like, 20 seconds in.

19:18.560 --> 19:19.920
Come on.

19:19.920 --> 19:22.160
- It's not funny.
-  It is funny.

19:24.080 --> 19:26.280
Couldn't do this with a stranger,
could you?

19:32.200 --> 19:34.440
Saskia, dear, come back to the dormitory.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.280
- You knew.
- You're delirious.

19:36.280 --> 19:38.320
Come back to the dormitory.
You'll get much better sleep.

19:38.320 --> 19:39.960
You knew what he was doing.

19:39.960 --> 19:41.800
I have absolutely no idea
what you're talking about.

19:41.800 --> 19:43.720
Stop, please.

19:43.720 --> 19:45.400
You knew what he was doing to me.

19:46.040 --> 19:47.720
Did you know about the others?

19:50.240 --> 19:52.320
The detentions were all I had
to keep him away from you.

19:52.320 --> 19:53.560
I don't expect you to understand.

19:53.680 --> 19:56.040
Well, fuck your fucking detentions

19:56.320 --> 19:59.280
because they didn't do shit, and you...

20:00.200 --> 20:01.920
Saskia, Saskia.

20:02.560 --> 20:03.560
Saskia.

20:04.520 --> 20:06.280
Real friggin' subtle.

20:06.800 --> 20:08.160
Saskia.

20:09.920 --> 20:10.960
Oh.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.800
Our recliner had this...

20:24.400 --> 20:27.000
permanent shadow of my mum.

20:29.000 --> 20:33.320
Like, like an actual imprint
from her being in the couch

20:33.320 --> 20:36.080
for months on end.

20:38.800 --> 20:40.560
And that's how it'd be, you know.

20:42.720 --> 20:45.440
She'd sit on that couch, day in, day out.

20:47.480 --> 20:52.040
Till one morning, you just wake up
and she'd harvested half the peanuts

20:52.040 --> 20:53.960
in the middle of the night
on a whim and...

20:55.440 --> 20:56.760
And when you grow up like that,

20:56.760 --> 21:00.160
you just wait.
You just wait, and you think...

21:01.680 --> 21:04.000
it's inevitable, you know,
it's in me too, and...

21:06.400 --> 21:09.520
And then, when it finally did happen,
it was like...

21:10.200 --> 21:11.400
Oh!

21:12.200 --> 21:14.080
It's not sadness.

21:14.200 --> 21:17.320
It's just nothingness.

21:19.240 --> 21:23.200
And now I have no idea who I am
without the antidepressants.

21:25.560 --> 21:26.880
But the thought of...

21:28.440 --> 21:32.440
of stopping them with
what might be waiting to come untethered?

21:33.960 --> 21:37.560
Hey, you're not your mum, Amelia.

21:38.400 --> 21:39.800
No, I am like her.

21:42.640 --> 21:44.320
I'm also not, right?

21:46.200 --> 21:47.680
Because I'm here.

21:50.560 --> 21:52.880
I'm so sorry that all of that
happened to you.

21:55.000 --> 21:59.160
It's my biggest regret that you had
to go through all of that alone.

22:03.600 --> 22:04.600
Thank you.

22:46.720 --> 22:47.960
I feel better.

22:49.640 --> 22:50.880
Yeah, me too.

22:51.480 --> 22:52.440
Nausea's gone.

22:52.960 --> 22:55.320
I mean about having it
all out in the open now, just...

22:56.800 --> 22:58.240
I feel so much better.

23:00.040 --> 23:00.960
I'm done.

23:01.680 --> 23:02.720
No more secrets.

23:05.720 --> 23:06.640
No more secrets.

23:19.160 --> 23:20.640
Oh, f...

23:22.240 --> 23:23.400
Please, let me explain.

23:29.240 --> 23:32.880
I knew he was texting girls
and asking them to save him

23:32.880 --> 23:35.600
under another name,
so I'd confiscate the phones.

23:35.600 --> 23:38.360
I knew he was meeting girls
on the boundary of the campus,

23:38.360 --> 23:40.120
which is outside
the school's jurisdiction,

23:40.120 --> 23:43.040
so I'd intercept them and I'd punish them
for being out of bounds.

23:43.040 --> 23:47.160
And I watched all his... favorites
like a hawk.

23:48.720 --> 23:50.720
And I found excuses
to put them into detention

23:50.720 --> 23:52.480
to prevent them from meeting him.

23:53.440 --> 23:57.160
To obstruct whatever bond he was building
in whatever way I could.

23:59.520 --> 24:01.800
They were imperfect solutions, Saskia.

24:01.800 --> 24:03.440
I don't expect to be forgiven.

24:04.160 --> 24:07.040
I know that I could have done more.

24:19.120 --> 24:20.640
Oh, you're all fucking cunts.

24:24.240 --> 24:25.280
You included.

24:28.640 --> 24:29.560
Amen.

24:39.720 --> 24:43.440
Sick digs, Sister Barbica.

24:43.960 --> 24:47.240
We could've been having scramby eggs
and parsley this entire time.

24:47.240 --> 24:49.560
Yeah, not to mention communion wafers.

24:49.560 --> 24:52.680
I was going to tell you about all this,

24:52.680 --> 24:55.520
but, to be fair,
you got custody of the tuck shop.

24:56.600 --> 24:59.560
Well, that was one way of getting over
my fear of shitting at school.

25:03.440 --> 25:07.080
Hey, guys, if you were to write a letter

25:07.080 --> 25:10.280
to your younger selves now,
what would it say?

25:10.280 --> 25:12.760
- Don't eat the fish.

25:12.760 --> 25:16.920
No, but, seriously,
like, what do you regret never doing?

25:18.200 --> 25:20.320
I regret that I was such a narc in school.

25:21.200 --> 25:22.840
I never even smoked a cigarette.

25:23.760 --> 25:26.480
I think we can probably remedy that.
Who else?

25:27.640 --> 25:31.040
I know that it's superficial,
but I regret not having a baby shower.

25:31.040 --> 25:33.160
I was really looking forward
to all that free shit.

25:33.160 --> 25:36.320
Okay, Teacup is getting a baby shower.
Who's next?

25:36.920 --> 25:40.520
Uh, I regret not getting rid of Garrity
from the school when I had a chance.

25:40.520 --> 25:45.120
Fuck, yes, let's deep clean this entire
place of that motherfucker, okay?

25:45.120 --> 25:46.080
Who else?

25:46.080 --> 25:48.920
I regret that I took
my bucket for granted.

25:49.400 --> 25:52.160
I'm not going to fill my bucket
with anything but water from now on.

25:52.160 --> 25:54.080
I don't really understand
what that one means,

25:54.080 --> 25:55.400
but it sounds doable.

25:55.960 --> 25:57.320
- Renee?
- I don't think, I...

25:57.320 --> 25:58.800
I don't think I have any regrets.

25:59.480 --> 26:02.120
After reading my letter,

26:02.600 --> 26:06.840
all I ever wanted to be was
a nail technician, and I did it.

26:08.600 --> 26:09.520
Amelia?

26:11.760 --> 26:13.160
I regret that...

26:14.200 --> 26:17.160
I never learned all the words
to "One Week" by Barenaked Ladies.

26:17.960 --> 26:18.800
Wait, what?

26:18.800 --> 26:21.280
Wait, you mean the "Chickity China,
the Chinese chicken" song?

26:21.280 --> 26:22.760
Yes. Yes.

26:22.760 --> 26:24.880
What the hell are all those words?

26:25.200 --> 26:26.160
<i>It's been...</i>

26:26.160 --> 26:28.320
<i>One week since you looked at me</i>

26:28.320 --> 26:30.480
<i>Cocked your head to the side
and said, "I'm angry"</i>

26:30.480 --> 26:32.200
<i>Five days since you laughed at me</i>

26:32.200 --> 26:34.880
<i>Saying, "Get that together,
come back and see me"</i>

26:34.880 --> 26:36.640
<i>Three days since the living room</i>

26:36.640 --> 26:38.880
<i>I realized it's all my fault
but couldn't tell you</i>

26:38.880 --> 26:40.840
<i>Yesterday, you'd forgiven me</i>

26:40.840 --> 26:43.040
<i>But it'll still be two days
'til I say I'm sorry</i>

26:43.040 --> 26:44.920
<i>Hold me now and watch the hoodwink</i>

26:44.920 --> 26:47.600
<i>As I make you stop, think
You'll think you're looking at Aquaman</i>

26:47.600 --> 26:49.560
<i>I summon fish to the dish
although I like the Chalet Swiss</i>

26:49.560 --> 26:50.480
<i>I like the sushi</i>

26:50.480 --> 26:52.120
<i>'Cause it's never touched
a frying pan</i>

26:53.880 --> 26:55.760
Do we know any other bits?

26:55.960 --> 26:58.080
<i>Chickity China, the Chinese chicken</i>

26:58.080 --> 27:00.160
<i>You have a drumstick
and your brain stops tickin'</i>

27:00.160 --> 27:01.760
<i>Watching X- Files with no lights on</i>

27:01.760 --> 27:03.040
<i>We're dans la maison</i>

27:03.040 --> 27:04.400
<i>I hope the Smoking Man's in this one</i>

27:04.400 --> 27:06.680
<i>Gonna get a set of better clubs
Gonna find the kind with tiny nubs</i>

27:06.680 --> 27:08.760
<i>Just so my irons aren't always
flying off the back-swing</i>

27:08.760 --> 27:09.880
<i>Gotta get in tune with Sailor Moon</i>

27:09.880 --> 27:11.600
<i>'Cause that cartoon
has got the boom anime babes</i>

27:11.600 --> 27:12.960
<i>That make me think the wrong thing</i>

27:12.960 --> 27:15.080
<i>How can I help it if I think you're funny
when you're mad?</i>

27:15.080 --> 27:17.400
<i>Trying hard not to smile though I feel bad</i>

27:17.400 --> 27:19.280
<i>I'm the kind of guy
who laughs at a funeral</i>

27:19.280 --> 27:21.640
<i>Can't understand what I mean?
You soon will</i>

27:21.640 --> 27:23.640
<i>I have a tendency to wear my mind
on my sleeve</i>

27:23.640 --> 27:26.040
<i>- I have a history of losing my shirt...
- I have a history of taking my shirt...</i>

27:26.040 --> 27:27.280
Taking "off" my shirt.

27:27.280 --> 27:29.200
- Losing my shirt.
- No, no.

27:29.760 --> 27:31.040
Losing my shirt is right.

27:31.480 --> 27:33.600
- Oh, fuck this song!

27:33.600 --> 27:36.040
<i>It's been one week since you looked at me</i>

27:36.040 --> 27:38.720
<i>Dropped your arms to the sides
and said, "I'm sorry"</i>

27:38.720 --> 27:40.720
<i>Five days since I laughed at you and said</i>

27:40.720 --> 27:42.840
<i>"You just did just what I thought
you were gonna do"</i>

27:42.840 --> 27:44.840
<i>Three days since the living room</i>

27:44.840 --> 27:47.200
<i>We realized we're both to blame
but what could we do?</i>

27:47.200 --> 27:48.800
<i>Yesterday, you just smiled at me</i>

27:48.800 --> 27:51.800
<i>'Cause it'll still be two days
'til we say we're sorry</i>

27:53.240 --> 27:56.040
<i>It'll still be two days
'til we say we're sorry</i>

27:57.800 --> 28:03.240
<i>It'll still be two days
'til we say, we're sorry</i>

28:03.240 --> 28:04.400
Yow!

28:04.520 --> 28:06.440
Thank fuck that's over.

28:14.080 --> 28:15.240
Well done, buddy.

28:26.560 --> 28:27.720
Today...

28:28.760 --> 28:30.240
we bid farewell

28:31.280 --> 28:34.360
to the men who thrived in the gray area,

28:35.000 --> 28:37.320
who exploited the benefit of the doubt

28:38.160 --> 28:41.960
and depended on the silence of others.

28:45.360 --> 28:49.000
Today, we say to those men...

28:52.720 --> 28:53.680
Get fucked.

28:54.840 --> 28:57.320
Get fucked.

29:12.840 --> 29:14.520
- Zoe.
- Hmm?

29:15.800 --> 29:17.480
I've run out of antidepressants.

29:23.320 --> 29:24.480
You'll be okay, mate.

29:25.960 --> 29:27.040
I'll make sure of it.

29:32.840 --> 29:37.080
Yeah, feels good to have
everyone's regret sorted, huh?

29:37.360 --> 29:38.800
-  Yeah.
- It does.

29:39.840 --> 29:42.480
Yeah, yeah, no,
it feels great, doesn't it?

29:43.480 --> 29:46.600
Feels so good, feels really good
to have it all sorted.

29:49.160 --> 29:50.760
Are you fucking serious?

29:50.880 --> 29:51.840
- Huh?
- Uh...

29:51.840 --> 29:53.120
You've forgotten me.

29:53.760 --> 29:54.680
Again.

29:54.680 --> 29:56.880
- Oh, yes.
- Oh.

29:57.280 --> 29:59.720
Since none of you came to my non-funeral,

30:00.160 --> 30:01.600
I want a real one.

30:01.600 --> 30:06.120
I want to be eulogized
and spoken fondly of

30:06.120 --> 30:09.760
and commemorated
and not fucking forgotten.

30:09.760 --> 30:11.440
Jesus Christ, you women...

30:11.440 --> 30:14.080
All right, girls. What do you say
we have a funeral tomorrow?

30:14.080 --> 30:15.960
-  Yes. Yeah.
-  Great.

30:16.480 --> 30:17.400
Sorted.

30:24.240 --> 30:25.160
Greyish beige.
