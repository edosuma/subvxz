00:08.634 --> 00:10.678
<i>Previously on "You Me Her"...</i> Izzy: Jack's back --

00:10.761 --> 00:13.305
we got all schmaltzy, we had crazy amazing make-up sex.

00:13.388 --> 00:14.849
Scary Nina?

00:14.932 --> 00:16.600
I know it's fast, but yeah.

00:16.684 --> 00:18.644
You gotta to hold her real tight, like an autism blanket.

00:18.727 --> 00:19.854
He's a love junkie.

00:19.937 --> 00:21.229
What's this? Hey.

00:21.313 --> 00:22.857
A number in the middle of a piece of paper?

00:22.940 --> 00:24.984
It's a salary. Like, every year?

00:25.066 --> 00:26.819
Private jet. Five-star hotel.

00:26.902 --> 00:28.696
Wait, so this is about a job?

00:28.779 --> 00:30.113
Coolest firm in Seattle.

00:30.197 --> 00:34.368
She just got an absolutely stupid offer in Seattle.

00:34.451 --> 00:36.620
Seattle. Is that a thing, Em?

00:36.704 --> 00:39.581
Yeah. Is it?

00:39.665 --> 00:41.291
You okay? No, I'm not okay.

00:41.375 --> 00:42.960
My parents are coming in an RV.

00:43.042 --> 00:44.753
They make me a tad psychotic.

00:44.837 --> 00:45.963
What's the plan for this one right here?

00:46.045 --> 00:48.340
I'm in a timeout so they can play normal.

00:48.423 --> 00:49.633
So, what's going on?

00:49.717 --> 00:51.176
They're meeting with their baby doc.

00:51.259 --> 00:52.678
What if they're pregnant?

00:52.761 --> 00:54.972
My professional recommendation would be surrogacy.

00:55.055 --> 00:57.098
Do you think we're making a mistake sending Izzy away

00:57.182 --> 00:58.433
every time she's an inconvenience?

00:58.517 --> 01:00.060
How do we explain her presence here?

01:00.143 --> 01:01.269
I have an idea.

01:01.353 --> 01:04.189
Izzy here is having our baby.

01:04.272 --> 01:06.066
They're saying we're finally gonna have a grandchild.

01:06.149 --> 01:08.235
It kind of feels like -- like we're supposed

01:08.318 --> 01:09.236
to do this together.

01:09.319 --> 01:10.696
Mom. Oh, fudge me.

01:10.779 --> 01:12.823
Don't jump to any conclusions.

01:12.907 --> 01:16.159
Somebody call a meeting and forget to -- Ooh.

01:16.243 --> 01:17.870
What's your baby mama doing in bed with you?

01:17.953 --> 01:21.665
I'm a conceptionally challenged bisexual.

01:21.749 --> 01:23.208
Harold, are you...

01:23.291 --> 01:24.668
Emma: Dad?

01:24.752 --> 01:26.127
Hal, look at me.

01:26.211 --> 01:28.338
I think I just gave my father a heart attack.

01:36.513 --> 01:38.348
Emma, listen, you can't give someone a heart attack

01:38.432 --> 01:41.936
like a virus or a curse.

01:42.019 --> 01:43.896
Finding out who I really am was so disappointing

01:43.979 --> 01:46.023
his heart couldn't handle it.

01:46.105 --> 01:47.733
Em, I don't even think it was a heart attack.

01:47.816 --> 01:49.693
I still feel that Kung Pao pork, like,

01:49.777 --> 01:51.695
all the way up in my esophagus.

01:54.740 --> 01:56.867
Glad you pervs are having fun.

01:56.951 --> 01:59.202
Mom. No. No, we're not.

01:59.286 --> 02:01.830
Um, we were just trying to convince Emma

02:01.914 --> 02:03.999
that she couldn't have given Hal a heart attack.

02:08.420 --> 02:11.966
Well, nobody forced him to find the best cheeseburger

02:08.420 --> 02:11.966
in every state, right?

02:13.508 --> 02:16.470
Oh, I'm just fudging with you. He's fine.

02:16.553 --> 02:20.140
He fell asleep 30 seconds after they hit him with the diazepam.

02:24.770 --> 02:27.355
I can't remember the last time we hugged like this.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.027
That's my fault.

02:33.779 --> 02:35.322
All the secrets.

02:35.405 --> 02:37.825
Secrets are like, uh...

02:40.077 --> 02:43.413
well, they're like -- Uh, metaphor assistance.

02:43.497 --> 02:46.458
Uh, keeping someone at an arm's length.

02:46.541 --> 02:49.711
Um, stiff arm. It's, like, a football term.

02:49.795 --> 02:50.629
What?

02:50.712 --> 02:52.422
Secrets are like stiff arms.

02:52.506 --> 02:54.508
So fudging bad.

02:54.591 --> 02:57.218
You aren't the only one keeping secrets, Emma Seaver.

02:57.302 --> 02:58.553
Trakarsky. Let it go.

02:58.637 --> 02:59.638
Mm, yeah.

02:59.721 --> 03:02.016
Dad's bisexual, too, isn't he?

03:02.099 --> 03:03.391
I wish.

03:03.475 --> 03:04.893
The man's insatiable. Oh, okay.

03:04.977 --> 03:07.062
It would be nice to tag out every once in a while.

03:07.146 --> 03:10.024
Oh, my God, that's gonna echo through the rest of her life.

03:10.107 --> 03:11.900
He had a panic attack.

03:11.984 --> 03:15.194
It was his own damn fault

03:11.984 --> 03:15.194
for not taking his pills.

03:16.363 --> 03:18.573
Wait, you mean this is a thing?

03:18.657 --> 03:20.826
This has happened before?

03:20.909 --> 03:23.537
The only people who know are me, him, and his doctor.

03:25.288 --> 03:28.000
It still terrifies me every time.

03:31.670 --> 03:34.131
There's no me without him.

03:35.298 --> 03:37.926
That probably doesn't sound very progressive or cool.

03:38.010 --> 03:40.054
Mom, Mom.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.473
That sounds exceptionally cool.

03:48.562 --> 03:49.771
Can we go see him now?

03:49.855 --> 03:51.732
Of course, sweetheart.

03:51.815 --> 03:55.944

08:46.567 --> 08:51.156
maybe instead of dating or fucking a lot of girls

Hi, everybody, welcome to the Griffin Wellness Cent --

09:22.396 --> 09:25.482
Welcome to<i> our</i> Griff -- Griffin Wellness Center.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.775
Hal: "Only two things you need to know about me.

09:27.859 --> 09:30.237
First thing, I'm not a real doctor.

09:30.320 --> 09:33.114
And the second thing, I actually practiced

09:33.198 --> 09:35.616
this lame-ass welcome speech because

09:35.700 --> 09:37.369
I'm a quivering fucktard."

09:37.452 --> 09:40.163
Really, Hal?

09:40.247 --> 09:41.748
I'm not the one who faked a heart attack

09:41.831 --> 09:44.042
when he found out his daughter was bisexual.

09:44.125 --> 09:45.544
Gotcha there.

09:48.422 --> 09:50.424
So, go ahead, get to it.

09:50.507 --> 09:54.135
This is the part where you say I'm the one

09:50.507 --> 09:54.135
who turned her gay-ish.

09:54.219 --> 09:55.929
No.

09:56.012 --> 09:59.974
This is the part where I tell you I know<i> you</i> didn't.

10:03.686 --> 10:05.813
I don't give shit to people I don't like, Jack.

10:05.897 --> 10:08.442
I just don't talk to them.

10:08.525 --> 10:12.862
So, you're saying you like me?

10:15.823 --> 10:18.076
Well, you're the doctor.

10:21.913 --> 10:24.249
Come here.

10:24.332 --> 10:25.875
Sit down.

10:25.959 --> 10:29.712
Okay, but only if you say your daughter's name --

10:29.796 --> 10:31.839
her full married name. Come on, man.

10:34.468 --> 10:36.511
You can do it.

10:36.595 --> 10:38.679
Let's hear it.

10:38.763 --> 10:41.182
Emma Trakarsky.

10:42.725 --> 10:44.185
Well, you didn't make my daughter gay-ish,

10:44.269 --> 10:47.397
but you did make her a Pollack.

10:47.481 --> 10:49.399
Okay, well, that's incredibly offensive,

10:49.483 --> 10:53.111
but not surprising, so let's do this.

10:53.194 --> 10:55.447
You're a good man, Jack.

10:57.698 --> 10:59.284
I am? You are.

10:59.367 --> 11:00.994
Huh. But I'm gonna tell you

11:01.077 --> 11:02.412
something very important,

11:02.496 --> 11:05.165
and I want you to listen real close.

11:07.834 --> 11:09.002
Okay.

11:09.085 --> 11:11.588
It's high time to sack the fuck up.

11:11.671 --> 11:12.964
Sack the fuck up?

11:13.047 --> 11:15.509
I think we both know what you really want.

11:19.137 --> 11:20.430
Yeah.

11:23.517 --> 11:26.727
Got any old Oh, I do.

11:26.811 --> 11:28.813

11:44.621 --> 11:46.873
What

11:46.956 --> 11:49.042
No, soon-ish.

11:49.750 --> 11:51.127
I'd be like a surrogate

11:51.211 --> 11:54.255
so we could all physically be involved.

11:54.339 --> 11:56.841
If I don't, then someone else will,

11:56.924 --> 11:59.302
and then there's four of us all mixed up together.

11:59.386 --> 12:03.348
Are you really into having a baby soon

12:03.431 --> 12:04.932
I don't know.

12:05.016 --> 12:08.936
I mean, they want one, so...

12:09.020 --> 12:11.398
and I'm with them.

12:13.441 --> 12:15.985
It just feels like if they have a baby

12:16.069 --> 12:18.613
without me, with a surrogate,

12:19.614 --> 12:22.116
kind of feels like that'll be the end.

12:26.913 --> 12:28.623
Fuck. Fuck.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.877

12:32.960 --> 12:35.213

13:16.546 --> 13:19.549
Just take a break or something?

13:22.302 --> 13:26.723
So... on a scale of 1 to 10, how mad are you?

13:26.805 --> 13:29.476

13:29.559 --> 13:34.439

13:34.522 --> 13:36.857

13:45.575 --> 13:47.201
Yeah, so instead of having you killed,

13:47.285 --> 13:49.329
I'm just gonna kick you in the balls

13:49.412 --> 13:51.581
with these pointy-toed heels. Goodness.

13:51.665 --> 13:54.626
So, just be a gentleman and spread your legs.

13:54.709 --> 13:57.754
That sounds like more than a six, I'll be honest.

13:57.836 --> 14:00.881
All right, it might be a nine.

14:04.302 --> 14:06.596
Another life, you know?

14:08.139 --> 14:09.890
Yeah.

14:10.725 --> 14:12.893
Yeah, maybe it's happening right now.

14:12.977 --> 14:14.437
Yeah.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.897
Both: Cat in the box.

14:16.981 --> 14:18.817
Yeah.

14:21.110 --> 14:23.321
So, what's next with the throuple?

14:24.905 --> 14:27.950
I actually think I have to make some sort of

14:28.034 --> 14:30.495
definitive gesture.

14:33.039 --> 14:34.332
Yeah.

14:36.710 --> 14:39.170
Anyway, I got to run.

14:40.338 --> 14:41.798
Yeah, go. It's like the man said,

14:41.881 --> 14:44.425
you know, I got to go big, so... Mm-hmm.

14:44.509 --> 14:46.594
I'm gonna just...

Here's to the death of love.

15:07.532 --> 15:09.534
Hey, guys, you guys like chants?

15:09.617 --> 15:10.910
Everybody likes chants.

15:10.993 --> 15:13.246
Say it with me, okay?

15:13.329 --> 15:14.955
No more love!

That's actually what I'm gonna do -- I'm gonna fuck everybody.

15:28.887 --> 15:30.847
Well, what a coincidence.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.767
That's my new program, too.

15:40.440 --> 15:44.360
There will be no cuddling, and I won't be calling you.
