00:42.713 --> 00:45.016
It's that new game doodle fever.

00:45.051 --> 00:48.265
Oh, good, I love games.

00:48.300 --> 00:49.999
Okay, I'm going to draw something.

00:50.034 --> 00:52.460
You have to guess what I'm
drawing in two minutes.

00:52.495 --> 00:54.162
Why don't you just tell
me what it is?

00:54.197 --> 00:56.347
Then we don't have to play.

00:56.382 --> 00:59.046
Well, that wouldn't be very
fun, now, would it?

00:59.081 --> 01:03.408
We're supposed to be
having fun, right?

01:03.443 --> 01:06.539
- Hey, you ready?
- Yeah. All right.

01:06.574 --> 01:07.957
Go.

01:10.794 --> 01:12.752
It's a line.

01:13.754 --> 01:17.624
It's a slightly crooked line.
It's, um...

01:18.502 --> 01:20.973
It's a line that should be straighter.

01:29.342 --> 01:31.024
Two lines.

01:31.059 --> 01:34.730
They're not parallel.
They're... uneven lines.

01:34.765 --> 01:38.488
They're uneve.. two uneven lines.
Uh...

01:38.523 --> 01:41.758
Asymmetrical.
It's an asymmetrical shape.

01:41.793 --> 01:47.372
A disturbing asymmetrical shape.
Am I close? - No.

02:03.586 --> 02:05.108
It's, uh...

02:06.823 --> 02:08.189
Uh...

02:18.268 --> 02:20.577
- Time's up.
- It's a houseboat.

02:20.612 --> 02:23.616
Oh, yeah, yeah, I can see that now.

02:23.651 --> 02:27.157
- Oh, I can see the wave.
- That's a shark.

02:27.212 --> 02:30.055
Oh, yeah. That should
have been a clue.

02:30.090 --> 02:33.426
- Well, that was fun.
- Ooh, wait, it's 9:00.

02:33.461 --> 02:35.716
- The show's about to start.
- Thank god.

02:35.751 --> 02:36.978
What are we watching?

02:37.013 --> 02:39.632
That concert for
the San francisco bicentennial.

02:39.667 --> 02:41.141
It's with Willie nelson.

02:41.176 --> 02:44.481
Hey, remember when you guys
saved his life? - Yes.

02:44.516 --> 02:47.815
And he gave Adrian one of
his own harmonicas.

02:47.850 --> 02:51.762
- Can I see it?
- Oh, no. I, I had to throw it out.

02:51.797 --> 02:54.970
Mr. Nelson put his,
you know, mouth on it.

02:55.005 --> 02:59.184
We're on tape at the Miranda
auditorium in San francisco.

02:59.219 --> 03:04.670
It's the bicentennial jamboree
with special guest Wille nelson.

03:19.752 --> 03:21.928
Sharona...

03:25.147 --> 03:27.610
MONK Season 3 Epi. 03
Mr. Monk and the Blackout

04:25.285 --> 04:26.526
You know that...

04:26.561 --> 04:29.651
nine months after every blackout,
the birth rate goes up?

04:29.686 --> 04:33.756
Nine months?
Ohh. I get it.

04:33.791 --> 04:36.025
Uh...

04:36.060 --> 04:38.530
Adrian, it's going to be okay.
Just relax, all right?

04:38.565 --> 04:40.792
Benjy, hold his hand.

04:43.102 --> 04:45.095
Ow. He's squeezing it.

04:45.130 --> 04:47.860
- Let him squeeze it.
- Uh...

04:47.895 --> 04:49.699
Adrian, please don't worry, all right?

04:49.734 --> 04:51.478
The lights are going to come
on soon, I'm telling you.

04:51.513 --> 04:54.693
Now I'm going to go in the kitchen,
fill the sink up with water,

04:54.728 --> 04:57.683
and look for another candle.

04:57.718 --> 04:59.449
When will it be over?

04:59.484 --> 05:02.246
I just told you,
it won't be long.

05:04.371 --> 05:08.277
- When will it be over?
- Adrian, they're working on it.

05:08.312 --> 05:12.426
When will it be over? - Will you
stop asking me that? I don't know.

05:12.461 --> 05:14.317
- When will it be over?
- I don't know.

05:14.352 --> 05:16.412
- When will it be over?
- Make him stop!

05:16.447 --> 05:20.077
God, Adrian, for the love of god,
please, come on!

05:22.842 --> 05:25.044
You see?
Now, was that so bad?

05:25.079 --> 05:27.565
I didn't know when it
would be over.

05:27.600 --> 05:30.125
So I heard.

05:31.320 --> 05:34.771
I didn't know when it
would be over.

05:39.100 --> 05:41.287
- Uh, miss, um...
- Rivas.

05:41.322 --> 05:42.842
Miss Rivas.

05:42.877 --> 05:45.651
You're saying that there was
no security here at all,

05:45.686 --> 05:47.479
no camera, no guard?

05:47.514 --> 05:50.373
The cameras were all on the outside.
There are none here in the main yard.

05:50.408 --> 05:53.285
Well, if the bomber knew that,
then this is probably an inside job.

05:53.320 --> 05:56.208
We're assuming it was,
or at least he knew what he was doing.

05:56.243 --> 05:57.840
You see, when this station went down,

05:57.875 --> 05:59.636
the next one on the grid
tried to compensate,

05:59.671 --> 06:02.460
then the one after that,
causing a full reactive power surge.

06:02.495 --> 06:05.454
3.2 seconds later, the entire
sector went dark.

06:05.489 --> 06:06.840
Actually, we got lucky.

06:06.875 --> 06:08.421
The bomb went off at exactly 9:00.

06:08.456 --> 06:10.797
20 minutes later, this station
would have been on the primary grid,

06:10.832 --> 06:12.883
and we would have lost half of california.

06:12.918 --> 06:14.770
Doesn't make sense.

06:14.805 --> 06:18.637
He knew where to set the bomb,
but not when to set the bomb.

06:18.672 --> 06:21.341
- He screwed up.
- Maybe.

06:21.376 --> 06:22.939
Or maybe he was being selective.

06:22.974 --> 06:25.401
Maybe he didn't want to
black out the whole state.

06:25.436 --> 06:26.560
Captain.

06:27.278 --> 06:30.795
Feds found a note, uh,
more like a manifesto.

06:30.830 --> 06:33.602
- Well, how are the Feds treating us?
- So far it's a love fest.

06:33.637 --> 06:35.106
They're sharing everything.

06:35.141 --> 06:38.523
Well, let's check it out
before they sober up.

06:38.986 --> 06:40.575
- Michelle.
- Yeah.

06:40.610 --> 06:42.592
- Where's Edelson?
- I don't know.

06:42.627 --> 06:44.804
If you see him, will you tell him
to get his butt over there?

06:44.839 --> 06:46.103
There's a reporter from the Chronicle.

06:46.138 --> 06:49.965
She's got a technical question,
needs to talk to an engineer.

06:50.763 --> 06:53.176
And tell that man
to put his hat on.

06:55.279 --> 06:57.974
I'm sorry, sir.
You're going to have to put your hat on.

06:59.635 --> 07:02.256
I can't wear a hat.

07:02.291 --> 07:05.604
Well, you have to wear it,
so just put it on.

07:10.939 --> 07:14.247
You look great.
Here you go.

07:16.539 --> 07:19.526
- Are you Adrian monk?
- Yes.

07:19.561 --> 07:22.625
Wow, I can't believe I'm meeting you.
I'm a huge fan of yours.

07:22.660 --> 07:26.292
I think you're mistaking me
for... anybody else.

07:26.327 --> 07:27.650
I was just reading about you.

07:27.685 --> 07:32.785
I was just reading about how you
recovered that stolen Picasso. - Oh.

07:32.820 --> 07:34.975
You're a genius.

07:35.010 --> 07:36.507
I'm Michelle rivas,

07:36.542 --> 07:40.395
resident P. R. flack
and hardhat adjuster.

07:43.068 --> 07:45.745
Are you afraid of cooties?

07:45.780 --> 07:48.620
Yes. Among other things.

07:48.655 --> 07:52.238
The article said that
you were single.

07:52.273 --> 07:56.248
I was married. She died.

07:56.283 --> 07:59.828
Wow. And you still
wear the ring.

07:59.863 --> 08:03.775
I like that.
That kind of devotion...

08:03.810 --> 08:06.073
you don't see that much anymore.

08:06.108 --> 08:08.559
No, you sure don't.

08:08.594 --> 08:11.007
Well, I'm Sharona, Adrian's assistant.

08:11.042 --> 08:14.690
- It's very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

08:15.766 --> 08:17.214
Gene, what are you doing up there?

08:17.249 --> 08:18.497
What am I doing?

08:18.532 --> 08:21.396
I am checking the auxiliary generator.

08:21.431 --> 08:23.812
Well, there's a reporter looking for you.

08:23.847 --> 08:25.405
You're the company mouth.

08:25.440 --> 08:27.706
You talk to them.
It's not my job.

08:27.741 --> 08:31.215
Excuse me.
Uh, do you see the sign?

08:31.539 --> 08:34.429
Oh, no problem. I got it.

08:37.241 --> 08:39.886
I've been dying to do
that for six months.

08:41.246 --> 08:43.922
Hey, Monk, we've got the
prelim on the explosive.

08:44.445 --> 08:50.435
We think 4 to 5 pounds of a high-density
plastique, magnesium charge.

08:50.470 --> 08:54.183
It was detonated with an egg timer.

08:54.218 --> 08:56.265
You mentioned a letter.
Is that the letter?

08:56.300 --> 08:59.301
Yeah, three pages taped to
the back door. It's unsigned.

08:59.336 --> 09:01.899
Yeah, it's your basic
environmental laundry list.

09:01.934 --> 09:05.130
Solar power, fossil fuel,
Saudi arabia,

09:05.165 --> 09:07.266
it's the only planet we have...

09:08.430 --> 09:14.517
"We are free men, unshackled
by your barbarous laws."

09:14.552 --> 09:16.688
I know that phrase.

09:16.723 --> 09:22.582
I've heard that before.
Unshackled...

09:22.617 --> 09:26.404
barbarous laws...

09:27.218 --> 09:33.243
10 years ago, that exact same
phrase was in a letter

09:33.278 --> 09:37.543
written by a guy named Winston, no.

09:37.578 --> 09:42.017
Yes. Winston brenner.

09:42.052 --> 09:44.380
Trudy wrote, wrote an article about him.

09:44.415 --> 09:48.099
I remember that guy.
He was a serious radical in Boston.

09:48.134 --> 09:50.762
He blew up a recruiting station,
couple of soldiers got killed.

09:50.797 --> 09:53.028
That's right. - Well, it looks like
he just came out of retirement.

09:53.063 --> 09:54.570
Let's check him out.

09:55.324 --> 09:56.569
Okay.

10:01.976 --> 10:03.979
Sharona, would you, um,
give this to Adrian?

10:04.014 --> 10:07.286
You know, just in case he
has any questions at all. - Sure.

10:07.321 --> 10:10.873
Or even if he doesn't.
That's my home number on the back.

10:12.693 --> 10:17.714
- Do you like him?
- Well, he's a very interesting man.

10:17.749 --> 10:22.034
- Yes, he is.
- And he's obviously brilliant.

10:23.553 --> 10:26.343
Well, he can be, yes.

10:26.378 --> 10:28.465
Does he date?

10:28.500 --> 10:32.848
Does, does he date?
Um...no.

10:32.883 --> 10:35.118
Is there something wrong with him?

10:44.358 --> 10:46.161
No.

10:47.663 --> 10:50.198
I'm going to hell.
I'm a horrible person.

10:50.233 --> 10:51.577
Why?

10:51.612 --> 10:55.577
I just told that woman Michelle
that there was nothing wrong with you.

10:55.612 --> 10:57.204
She should have asked me.

10:57.239 --> 10:59.350
I just didn't know what to say.

10:59.385 --> 11:01.511
I just thought...

11:01.546 --> 11:03.860
You know, you might want
to call her.

11:03.895 --> 11:06.471
Maybe it's time.

11:06.506 --> 11:08.475
I don't think so.

11:10.684 --> 11:13.807
Adrian, I'm talking to
you as a friend, okay?

11:13.842 --> 11:17.151
She seems really nice,
and I think you should call her.

11:17.186 --> 11:19.303
Just see what happens.

11:21.206 --> 11:23.037
Mm, no.

11:23.328 --> 11:25.451
All right, here, here, here, here.

11:25.486 --> 11:27.322
Why don't you take this
in case you change your mind?

11:27.357 --> 11:30.529
- Her number's on the back.
- No.

11:30.564 --> 11:32.405
All right, then I'll say the number.

11:32.440 --> 11:34.494
I know once you hear it,
you're not going to forget it.

11:34.529 --> 11:38.474
- 555...
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

11:39.615 --> 11:44.602
555... - Na na na na na
na na na na na na na na

11:47.338 --> 11:50.812
555-0198.

11:55.393 --> 11:56.390
Captain.

11:59.093 --> 12:00.402
Monk was right.

12:01.985 --> 12:05.084
And you were right, too, sir,
about Monk being right.

12:05.119 --> 12:06.372
Good work.

12:06.407 --> 12:08.568
- What do you got, Randy?
- Winston brenner.

12:08.603 --> 12:10.702
He was an activist in the '90s.

12:10.737 --> 12:13.386
He was indicted in a series
of bombings in Boston.

12:13.421 --> 12:15.302
Pretty angry individual.

12:15.337 --> 12:16.666
Here, look at this.

12:16.701 --> 12:18.422
This is the letter from the power plant.

12:18.457 --> 12:20.978
This one is from 11 years ago.

12:21.013 --> 12:22.595
He uses a lot of the same phrases.

12:22.630 --> 12:24.791
"The blood I shed today,"
"the blood I shed today."

12:24.826 --> 12:27.433
"Price of absolute freedom,"
"price of absolute freedom."

12:27.468 --> 12:29.577
Check this out.

12:32.520 --> 12:34.521
The handwriting is identical.

12:34.556 --> 12:36.273
This is definitely the guy.

12:36.308 --> 12:38.273
The only thing is, is that back then,

12:38.308 --> 12:40.399
Brenner didn't really care
about the environment.

12:40.434 --> 12:42.082
Anti-military was his thing.

12:42.117 --> 12:43.572
Did you read the rest
of the file, Randy?

12:43.607 --> 12:45.626
We've got some pictures, too.
They're blurry but good.

12:45.661 --> 12:47.893
- Read the rest of the file, Randy.
- Which part?

12:47.928 --> 12:50.662
The part here where it
says that he died.

12:51.254 --> 12:54.450
Deceased 1995.

12:54.485 --> 12:56.830
He blew himself up before the trial.

12:58.100 --> 13:00.046
He's dead.

13:03.307 --> 13:05.361
No, I won't be reasonable.

13:05.396 --> 13:07.967
I'm sick and tired
of being reasonable.

13:08.002 --> 13:10.921
I'm not coming down
until you agree

13:10.956 --> 13:15.146
to build your stupid condo
somewhere else!

13:15.181 --> 13:18.682
- Did you call Michelle?
- No.

13:18.717 --> 13:21.808
- Did you think about it?
- No.

13:21.843 --> 13:23.542
Well, did you think about
thinking about it?

13:23.577 --> 13:26.902
Sharona, I'm a married man.

13:27.858 --> 13:31.653
- Captain, lieutenant.
- Sharona, Monk.

13:31.688 --> 13:34.127
- What's going on?
- Tree hugger.

13:34.162 --> 13:35.863
His name is Alby drake.

13:35.898 --> 13:39.602
He was Winston brenner's oldest friend.
They were roommates at M. I. T.

13:39.637 --> 13:42.668
- How long has he been up there?
- 10 days.

13:42.703 --> 13:44.239
He'll be down soon.

13:44.274 --> 13:48.060
The judge will be ordering an
eviction notice by tomorrow morning.

13:48.095 --> 13:50.465
The FBI, in their infinite wisdom,

13:50.500 --> 13:55.764
now agrees that Winston brenner may
have faked his own death back in 1995.

13:55.799 --> 13:57.889
If Brenner is still alive,

13:57.924 --> 14:01.557
that scruffy bird up there may
still be in contact with him.

14:01.592 --> 14:04.287
How does he go to the bathroom?

14:10.696 --> 14:12.791
Mr. Drake.

14:12.826 --> 14:15.992
My name is Leland stottlemeyer.
I'm with the San francisco police.

14:16.027 --> 14:18.717
He is filthy.
I need some wipes.

14:18.752 --> 14:20.389
I've got a copy of a document here.

14:20.424 --> 14:23.242
I'd like you to take a look at it.
I'm sending it up.

14:26.677 --> 14:28.218
What is it?

14:28.253 --> 14:32.572
There was a bombing at a power
plant on monday night.

14:32.607 --> 14:36.852
Yeah. I saw the lights go out.
It was a beautiful thing, man.

14:36.887 --> 14:38.523
The stars were awesome!

14:38.558 --> 14:42.355
We need you to look at that document and
tell me if you recognize the handwriting.

14:42.390 --> 14:43.860
Why should I?

14:43.895 --> 14:48.047
We believe that your friend
Winston brenner is still alive.

14:54.275 --> 14:59.274
Mr. Drake, we are also
sending up some wipes.

14:59.309 --> 15:00.476
What for?

15:00.511 --> 15:02.465
To clean yourself.

15:02.500 --> 15:05.822
They're pre-moistened.
They have a million and one uses.

15:05.857 --> 15:07.805
Go to hell!

15:09.891 --> 15:11.860
Mr. Drake, this isn't a game.

15:11.895 --> 15:14.685
During that blackout,
three people died.

15:16.428 --> 15:18.429
- They died?
- Yes, sir, they did.

15:18.464 --> 15:21.933
There were two heart attacks and
one young woman on a dialysis machine,

15:21.968 --> 15:25.953
which makes this a homicide investigation.
Do you understand me?

15:27.326 --> 15:29.621
It's me again.

15:29.656 --> 15:31.121
You know...

15:31.156 --> 15:35.310
Ralph nader uses the wipes.
He loves them.

15:35.345 --> 15:38.995
And, uh...
and Fidel castro.

15:39.030 --> 15:43.620
All the radicals...
love the pre-moistened wipes.

15:43.655 --> 15:46.620
Sting...
he uses them all the time.

15:46.655 --> 15:49.592
- Sting?
- He's a rock 'n' roller.

15:49.627 --> 15:53.222
Look, I'm going to need
to think about this.

15:53.257 --> 15:55.474
I need a little time here, okay?

15:55.509 --> 15:56.531
That's fine, Mr. Drake.

15:56.566 --> 15:59.032
Take your time.
We'll be back tomorrow.

15:59.067 --> 16:02.227
- Don't go anywhere.
- Not a problem.

16:03.310 --> 16:05.803
Oh. Oh.
Aah.

16:05.838 --> 16:07.063
Oh, god. Wipe.

16:07.098 --> 16:09.384
- Give him a wipe.
- Wipe.

16:09.419 --> 16:10.669
- You took them all.
- Oh.

16:10.704 --> 16:12.825
- You took them all.
- Ugh.

16:16.186 --> 16:18.785
Yo, Mr. Drake, wait, wait.

16:18.820 --> 16:21.278
we need, we need
some wipes down here.

16:21.313 --> 16:25.946
Could you, could you send
a couple down, please? - Sure.

16:27.675 --> 16:29.766
Hey! Hey!

16:34.086 --> 16:35.815
Thank you.

16:40.021 --> 16:42.633
You know, I, I thought about
you during the blackout.

16:42.668 --> 16:43.893
Were you, were you all right?

16:44.390 --> 16:46.241
I was at Sharona's.

16:46.276 --> 16:48.603
Good. Good, you weren't alone.

16:49.340 --> 16:51.899
A bomb at a power plant.

16:51.934 --> 16:55.106
- It's a scary world, huh?
- Yes. Yes, it is.

16:55.141 --> 16:57.653
I'm, I'm working on the case.

16:58.328 --> 17:01.703
- How's it going?
- It's tough.

17:01.738 --> 17:03.787
We have a suspect, but, um...

17:04.411 --> 17:07.137
He's officially been dead for nine years.

17:16.436 --> 17:17.884
What?

17:20.111 --> 17:23.807
Something happened.
This is pretty funny.

17:23.842 --> 17:27.409
- Mm, you're going to laugh.
- Okay.

17:30.019 --> 17:31.864
There's this woman.

17:31.899 --> 17:35.130
She works at the power plant.

17:35.165 --> 17:37.108
She, um...

17:37.143 --> 17:39.298
She said that she thought
I was interesting.

17:39.333 --> 17:40.984
She, she gave me her number.

17:43.258 --> 17:46.631
I, I told you it was funny.

17:46.666 --> 17:48.789
Is she nice?

17:49.411 --> 17:51.460
Adrian?

17:51.495 --> 17:54.053
Is she attractive?

17:54.088 --> 17:55.203
Are those new shoes?

17:55.238 --> 17:58.440
No, no, Adrian, don't
change the subject. Not today.

17:58.475 --> 17:59.973
I would like to talk about this woman.

18:00.008 --> 18:02.852
Is she attractive?

18:02.887 --> 18:04.178
I don't know.

18:04.213 --> 18:06.021
How am I supposed to know

18:06.056 --> 18:08.570
if a woman is attractive?

18:08.605 --> 18:10.594
By looking at her.

18:10.629 --> 18:13.148
Adrian, there's a reason
why you mentioned this,

18:13.183 --> 18:17.084
and I think you should give her a call.

18:17.119 --> 18:19.561
It's been eight years, Adrian.

18:20.661 --> 18:26.533
Maybe it's time for you to take
a tiny little baby step forward.

18:28.946 --> 18:33.755
Adrian, I'm your doctor,
and I'm writing you a prescription.

18:35.879 --> 18:37.219
I can't read your writing.

18:37.254 --> 18:39.213
It's upside-down.

18:39.248 --> 18:41.811
It says "call her".

18:41.846 --> 18:44.967
You don't have to go out with her.
You don't even have to meet her.

18:45.002 --> 18:48.343
Just give her a call.

18:50.091 --> 18:52.099
What's the worst that could happen?

18:56.893 --> 19:01.455
I...
I might not hate it.

19:04.166 --> 19:06.578
Hey. It's me.

19:07.884 --> 19:09.409
I'm good.

19:09.444 --> 19:11.624
I thought you might like to know

19:11.659 --> 19:14.664
some cops were here asking about you.

19:14.699 --> 19:17.916
I didn't tell them anything,
but I thought about it.

19:19.082 --> 19:21.897
Three people died in that blackout.
That's not cool.

19:21.932 --> 19:24.902
Innocent blood, man.
I thought those days were over.

19:27.009 --> 19:29.860
Don't even try to justify it.

19:29.895 --> 19:32.885
Yeah, well, if it happens again,
you're going to be sorry.

19:34.301 --> 19:36.950
No, brother, you be careful.

19:42.064 --> 19:44.988
- Hello?
- Hello. It's me.

19:45.023 --> 19:48.190
Adrian monk.
The detective.

19:48.225 --> 19:51.341
Hey. I was just thinking about you.

19:53.623 --> 19:56.125
I've been thinking about you, too.

19:56.160 --> 19:59.499
- How was your day?
- Oh, just still not over.

19:59.534 --> 20:02.430
I have 10 more press releases to write.

20:03.004 --> 20:05.281
Is there anything new in the investigation?

20:07.340 --> 20:08.937
Not yet.

20:08.972 --> 20:11.439
- This is a very tough case.
- Yeah.

20:11.474 --> 20:14.599
What is it about San francisco
that attracts so many kooks?

20:14.634 --> 20:16.321
Bombers and radicals.

20:16.356 --> 20:20.076
I mean, does San antonio, Texas
have problems like this?

20:20.111 --> 20:24.014
Texas.
Hold, please.

20:24.049 --> 20:27.837
Texas. Texas. Texas. Texas.

20:27.872 --> 20:34.455
- Where are you from?
- San francisco, born and bred.

20:34.490 --> 20:38.553
- How about you?
- Chicago, but I went to college here

20:38.588 --> 20:43.301
and just never left, like
everybody else, I guess. - Oh.

20:43.976 --> 20:47.496
What college did you attend,
and what did you study?

20:47.531 --> 20:50.052
Stanford.
I majored in journalism.

20:52.433 --> 20:55.320
- Trudy majored in journalism.
- Oh.

20:56.488 --> 20:57.983
What was she like?

21:01.201 --> 21:06.376
She loved poetry.
She could recite 100 poems by heart.

21:08.640 --> 21:10.944
She went barefoot all the time,

21:11.117 --> 21:12.872
even when it was freezing.

21:21.409 --> 21:24.709
She kept every promise she ever made.

21:25.892 --> 21:28.593
I loved the way she looked at me.

21:28.961 --> 21:32.160
I think I miss that
more than anything.

22:07.262 --> 22:08.354
Hey!

22:10.923 --> 22:12.909
What are you doing?

22:14.759 --> 22:16.889
I'm up here, man!

22:17.932 --> 22:20.997
What are you doing?
Hey! Stop!

22:23.529 --> 22:25.595
Stop!

22:32.033 --> 22:33.081
Hello, police?

22:33.116 --> 22:34.493
Somebody's trying to kill me!

22:34.528 --> 22:37.720
I'm at the spring hills development
at the construction site.

22:39.008 --> 22:42.503
Aah!
I'm in the big oak tree.

22:42.538 --> 22:45.303
No, wait, don't hang up!

22:54.444 --> 22:56.105
Aah!

23:05.792 --> 23:07.417
Aah!

23:11.546 --> 23:16.064
Aah!

23:27.086 --> 23:30.228
- Did you really call her?
- Yes, I called her.

23:30.263 --> 23:34.422
Is that so hard to believe?
Oh, no, no. I'm, I'm just stunned.

23:34.457 --> 23:38.386
- I, were you honest with her?
- Yes, I was.

23:38.421 --> 23:41.544
I laid all my cards on the table.

23:41.579 --> 23:43.534
I am so proud of you.

23:43.569 --> 23:46.987
I, are you going to see her?

23:47.022 --> 23:49.825
I don't know what happened.

23:49.860 --> 23:52.246
She said, "do you want
to get together?" And I panicked.

23:52.281 --> 23:55.438
I, I lost my head.
I said "okay."

23:56.122 --> 23:57.495
So you have a date.

23:58.910 --> 24:00.330
I have a date.

24:01.865 --> 24:05.784
- Aren't you excited?
- Yes, I am...

24:05.819 --> 24:10.657
if by excited you mean petrified
and full of regret.

24:10.692 --> 24:13.919
Petrified and full of regret.

24:13.954 --> 24:16.933
Welcome to the world of dating.

24:18.500 --> 24:19.891
Captain.

24:19.926 --> 24:22.218
Monk. Sharona.

24:22.253 --> 24:23.604
I'm sure you've noticed by now

24:23.639 --> 24:26.338
there used to be a big tree
standing right over there.

24:26.373 --> 24:29.893
- What time?
- 4:35 A. M.

24:29.928 --> 24:33.575
A security guard heard somebody
start up the bulldozer.

24:33.610 --> 24:35.365
Moments later...

24:35.400 --> 24:37.634
Timber.
Drake was dead on impact.

24:37.669 --> 24:39.834
Yeah, he made a phone call, though,
at about midnight.

24:39.869 --> 24:43.212
- To a pay phone, right?
- You guessed it. Palo alto.

24:43.247 --> 24:46.089
Oh, well, it had to be Brenner.
He's the guy.

24:46.124 --> 24:49.510
So not only is Winston brenner
alive and well,

24:49.545 --> 24:52.478
he's making sure his old pals
don't rat him out.

24:52.513 --> 24:53.483
That's right.

24:53.518 --> 24:55.649
The FBI is calling a powwow tonight.

24:55.684 --> 24:58.276
They want to compare notes
and synchronize watches.

24:58.311 --> 25:00.143
Whoa. Ouch.

25:00.178 --> 25:04.962
Tonight I, I, I can't make it.

25:05.768 --> 25:07.189
He has a date.

25:08.288 --> 25:11.662
- He has a date?
- Yes.

25:11.697 --> 25:16.578
It's that P. R. lady from
the power plant, right? - Ah, okay.

25:16.613 --> 25:17.890
Adrian monk, you're a stud.

25:17.925 --> 25:20.204
- I'm not a stud.
- You're a stud.

25:20.239 --> 25:22.085
Where are you going to take her?

25:22.120 --> 25:24.495
A place called Bianca's.

25:30.514 --> 25:31.789
What?

25:31.824 --> 25:34.309
Is there a problem?

25:47.359 --> 25:51.257
Hi.
It, it's me. Adrian monk.

25:51.292 --> 25:53.918
Right on time, Mr. Punctuality.

25:53.953 --> 25:57.496
Actually, that used to be
my nickname, Mr. Punctuality.

25:57.531 --> 25:59.952
- In college?
- Kindergarten.

26:01.582 --> 26:06.498
- I bought you a dozen roses.
- Well, they're beautiful.

26:07.918 --> 26:11.513
- What happened to the rest?
- I had to throw them out.

26:11.548 --> 26:14.177
They were all different.

26:15.212 --> 26:18.249
Well, thank you.

26:18.284 --> 26:19.411
Should we go up?

26:19.446 --> 26:22.472
I read the most amazing
review about this place.

26:22.507 --> 26:24.933
- It got four stars.
- Oh, good.

26:24.968 --> 26:30.572
And look, it says the most
spectacular view in town. - Oh...good.

26:37.992 --> 26:42.241
- Are you okay?
- Uh, the elevator's,

26:42.276 --> 26:45.283
- it's uneven. I think it's broken.
- No.

26:45.318 --> 26:48.912
- No, they always do that.
- It's broken.

26:51.338 --> 26:54.831
- I hope you don't mind.
- No, no, this is fine.

26:54.866 --> 26:58.173
- We're working up an appetite.
- That's the spirit.

26:58.208 --> 27:00.444
- I like your hat.
- Yeah, it's new.

27:00.479 --> 27:02.903
Although I think it's too small
or my head's too big.

27:02.938 --> 27:05.097
- Your head? No, it's perfect.
- Thank you.

27:05.132 --> 27:08.354
- It's perfectly round like Charlie brown.
- Thank you.

27:08.389 --> 27:10.712
- Were you born Caesarean?
- I don't know.

27:10.747 --> 27:16.449
I was born naturally,
but I was raised Caesarean. - Okay.

27:16.484 --> 27:18.193
Trudy's head was more of an oval.

27:18.228 --> 27:20.207
Yes, you mentioned that on the phone,

27:20.242 --> 27:22.194
- and that she loved poetry...
- That's right.

27:22.229 --> 27:26.196
And loved going barefoot
even when it was freezing. - Exactly.

27:34.501 --> 27:38.441
So, do you have any
brothers or sisters?

27:38.476 --> 27:41.922
Yes, I have a sister.
She's nine months pregnant.

27:41.957 --> 27:44.982
Oh, so you're gonna...
you're gonna be, uh...

27:45.017 --> 27:47.679
- An aunt.
- Exactly.

28:18.961 --> 28:20.467
Uhh...

28:20.502 --> 28:23.065
- You all right?
- Mm.

28:23.100 --> 28:24.541
So do you have any
brothers or sisters?

28:24.576 --> 28:26.595
Yes. Yes, I have a sister.

28:26.630 --> 28:29.846
She's pregnant.
Well, by now she might have had the baby.

28:29.881 --> 28:32.310
Good. A sense of humor.
You're gonna need it.

28:32.345 --> 28:36.226
The last 20 flights are the hardest.
Ahh.

28:38.984 --> 28:43.780
Oh, you dropped your flowers.
Oh.

28:44.446 --> 28:48.177
You dropped your flowers fell
down a little bit.

28:59.631 --> 29:00.929
Yes, sir?

29:04.130 --> 29:06.625
We have a reservation.

29:06.660 --> 29:09.332
- And the name?
- Monk.

29:09.367 --> 29:13.316
M as in "My God, that was
a lot of stairs."

29:13.351 --> 29:16.260
- O as in...
- oh, yes. I have you right here.

29:16.295 --> 29:19.466
Uh, your reservation was
for 35 minutes ago.

29:19.501 --> 29:21.159
Uh, I'm sorry. We had to
give away your table.

29:21.194 --> 29:24.574
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no.

29:24.609 --> 29:26.830
We just walked up 52 flights of stairs.

29:26.865 --> 29:28.784
You need to feed us.

29:28.819 --> 29:30.949
Uh, I'm sorry. There's
really nothing I can do

29:30.984 --> 29:34.988
- Until 12:15.
- Okay. No problem.

29:35.023 --> 29:38.253
- We'll wait.
- That's three hours.

29:39.283 --> 29:43.191
- Why don't you just take me home?
- Okay. No problem. Let's go.

29:43.226 --> 29:46.126
- It'll be a lot easier going down.
- You got that right.

29:46.161 --> 29:48.338
'Cause we're taking the elevator.

30:44.566 --> 30:48.535
- Hey, Benjy, put on channel 11.
- Why?

30:48.570 --> 30:51.770
They're showing that music special
again with Willie nelson.

30:51.805 --> 30:54.373
Why do we always watch
what you want to watch?

30:54.408 --> 30:56.425
Because you're sweet
and you love me.

30:56.460 --> 30:59.446
We're on tape at the Miranda
auditorium in San francisco.

30:59.481 --> 31:04.417
It's the bicentennial jamboree
with special...

31:10.391 --> 31:12.439
- Oh, man.
- what?

31:13.699 --> 31:17.600
- Again?
- I'll get the candles.

31:18.210 --> 31:20.788
- Oh, my god.
- What?

31:22.175 --> 31:24.665
Adrian's on his date.

31:24.928 --> 31:27.150
Lobby, lobby, lobby, lobby,

31:27.185 --> 31:30.449
- lobby, lobby, lobby...
- Thank you, phil.

31:30.484 --> 31:32.657
- You're my hero.
- Lobby, lobby, lobby...

31:32.692 --> 31:35.322
- Fire department's on the way.
- Thank god. What happened?

31:35.357 --> 31:38.975
It was another bomb.
At an auxiliary station. - Oh, my god.

31:39.010 --> 31:42.223
I work for the power company.
My job just got a whole lot harder.

31:42.258 --> 31:44.675
Lobby, lobby, lobby, lobby, lobby.

31:44.710 --> 31:49.578
Sir, there's no power.
It's not going to move.

31:49.613 --> 31:52.382
You're probably right.
Lobby, lobby, lobby, lobby...

31:52.417 --> 31:54.304
- Want to hear something sad?
- Hmm?

31:54.339 --> 31:56.627
This isn't even the worst
date I've had this year.

31:56.662 --> 31:58.251
- Really?
- Yeah.

31:58.286 --> 31:59.902
I went out with this guy from work,

31:59.937 --> 32:02.372
- Gene edelson. You met him.
- The engineer? Lobby, lobby...

32:02.407 --> 32:05.220
I guess I felt sorry for him.
I could tell he never got out much.

32:05.255 --> 32:07.936
He's into country/western.
Took me line-dancing.

32:07.971 --> 32:09.271
Oh, I'm so sorry.

32:09.306 --> 32:10.912
He had a couple drinks,
then a couple more,

32:10.947 --> 32:13.941
groped me for half an hour,
and puked all over the mechanical bull.

32:13.976 --> 32:16.108
Those quiet guys are the worst.

32:16.143 --> 32:23.009
Yeah, he sounds like a real loser.
Lobby, lobby, lobby, lobby...!

32:33.165 --> 32:36.273
You ok?
All clear, here.

32:36.308 --> 32:38.681
Sir!

32:39.391 --> 32:41.393
You can let go now.
We're in the lobby.

32:41.428 --> 32:45.409
Lobby, Lobby, lobby, lobby.

32:45.984 --> 32:47.993
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god, Adrian!

32:48.028 --> 32:50.643
- Adrian, are you all right?
- I'm fine. Where's Benjy?

32:50.678 --> 32:52.404
Don't, don't worry.
He's with my sister.

32:52.439 --> 32:56.505
No, don't confirm anything or
deny anything until I get there.

32:57.238 --> 32:59.198
Nothing wrong with him, huh?

33:01.980 --> 33:03.361
First dates are always tough.

33:03.396 --> 33:07.755
- How was your night?
- Not much better.

33:07.790 --> 33:11.336
I ate pizza with Benjy and saw the
first 30 seconds of that TV special.

33:11.371 --> 33:13.598
- What special?
- The one with Willie nelson.

33:13.633 --> 33:15.801
Remember, we tried to watch
it monday night?

33:15.836 --> 33:19.262
I swear to god, somebody at that
power company doesn't want me to see it.

33:19.297 --> 33:24.075
The blackout was at 9:15.
What kind of show starts at 9:15?

33:24.935 --> 33:27.070
I don't know. There was
a movie on before it.

33:27.105 --> 33:29.184
Maybe it was just really long.

33:30.862 --> 33:34.901
- what are the odds of that?
- Adrian.

33:37.166 --> 33:41.190
Two blackouts three days apart
at different times

33:41.225 --> 33:44.199
interrupting the same show?

33:44.843 --> 33:48.793
- What are you doing?
- You were right.

33:48.828 --> 33:52.389
Somebody doesn't want you
to see that TV special.

33:52.424 --> 33:55.178
That's what this whole thing
has been about.

33:55.659 --> 33:57.789
Willie nelson?

34:01.679 --> 34:04.390
The explosive device appears to be
identical to the first bomb.

34:04.425 --> 34:07.463
We are assuming this is the work
of the same individual or group.

34:08.429 --> 34:10.188
There will be another
statement at 6:00 A. M.

34:10.223 --> 34:13.303
If I have anything before then,
I will let you know.

34:13.338 --> 34:14.239
Thank you.

34:15.681 --> 34:17.985
- Michelle.
- Hello, Gene.

34:18.021 --> 34:20.436
How was your date with the detective?

34:20.471 --> 34:23.282
Don't you have anything else
to worry about, Gene?

34:23.317 --> 34:26.907
I overheard some cops talking, and the
reason that he was kicked off the force.

34:26.942 --> 34:28.799
He's off his rocker.

34:28.833 --> 34:31.719
Maybe so, but he's about
to solve this case.

34:31.754 --> 34:33.420
- Really?
- He's very close.

34:33.456 --> 34:36.908
They're going to make an arrest anytime.
Maybe tomorrow.

34:41.650 --> 34:45.252
Oh, great. We've been waiting for this.
Thanks a lot. Thanks.

34:45.286 --> 34:48.407
Sharona, is that it?
Is it the copy of the TV special?

34:48.442 --> 34:51.110
Yeah. I'll finally be able to see it.

34:51.146 --> 34:54.748
- What is that?
- It's night-vision goggles.

34:54.784 --> 34:57.206
I bought them after the first blackout.

34:58.598 --> 35:02.325
- How do I look?
- Like the fly.

35:02.360 --> 35:05.090
Oh, well.
It'll be dark.

35:10.366 --> 35:15.021
We're on tape at the Miranda
auditorium in San francisco.

35:15.056 --> 35:20.649
It's the bicentennial jamboree
with special guest Wille nelson.

35:20.684 --> 35:22.648
You can fast-forward.

35:23.710 --> 35:24.833
I want to watch it.

35:24.868 --> 35:27.637
Sharona, it is so late.
I've got to go to sleep.

35:27.672 --> 35:31.107
If I don't get my 45 minutes,
I can't function.

35:32.599 --> 35:34.636
Since when do you function?

35:36.919 --> 35:39.946
- So what are we looking for?
- I'm not sure,

35:39.981 --> 35:41.878
but I'll know it when I see it.

35:43.869 --> 35:46.908
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait, push play, push play.

35:46.943 --> 35:48.343
I think this is it.

35:49.449 --> 35:53.013
- Oh, my god.
- Unbelievable.

35:53.048 --> 35:55.166
It's that engineer from
the power company.

35:55.201 --> 35:56.333
what's his name? Gene...

35:56.368 --> 35:58.262
- Edelson.
- Edelson.

35:58.297 --> 36:00.899
Gene edelson.

36:00.934 --> 36:05.850
Except his real name
is Winston brenner.

36:06.322 --> 36:10.693
- The fugitive?
- Of course!

36:10.728 --> 36:15.102
Michelle mentioned that
Edelson liked country music.

36:15.137 --> 36:17.667
Okay, freeze. Freeze frame.

36:17.702 --> 36:19.327
Look at his face.

36:19.362 --> 36:22.948
He obviously never expected
to be on camera.

36:22.983 --> 36:24.918
Wait, wait, he...

36:24.953 --> 36:29.451
he blacked out the whole city twice
to keep people from seeing this concert?

36:29.486 --> 36:31.719
He was supposed to be dead.

36:31.754 --> 36:36.682
He was afraid somebody watching
would recognize him.

36:40.218 --> 36:41.676
What, what is...

36:41.711 --> 36:44.266
- Lobby, lobby, lobby...
- What...

36:44.301 --> 36:46.976
My god, my god...
why would he do this again?

36:47.011 --> 36:51.115
The show's not on TV.
I...

36:51.150 --> 36:54.913
- Ouch! Ouch!
- Oh, my god!

36:54.948 --> 36:57.656
- What is it? What? What? What?
- It's not a blackout.

36:57.691 --> 37:00.622
- It's only your block.
- Oh, that's bad.

37:00.657 --> 37:02.152
That is bad.

37:03.479 --> 37:07.159
- That's bad.
- Oh, god.

37:11.361 --> 37:14.472
Captain, hey, it's Sharona.
Listen to me.

37:14.507 --> 37:17.429
I'm at Adrian's house,
and somebody just cut off his power.

37:17.464 --> 37:19.993
We think it's Winston.

37:20.796 --> 37:24.560
Hello?
Hello?

37:24.595 --> 37:26.922
Hello?
Oh, god.

37:26.957 --> 37:28.569
The line's been cut!

37:28.604 --> 37:32.695
I cannot find my night-vision goggles.

37:33.277 --> 37:38.048
There is a fatal flaw in
the night-vision goggle plan.

37:42.639 --> 37:46.686
Adrian, he's breaking in.

37:46.721 --> 37:49.184
I hear him
Where's my broom?

37:49.219 --> 37:51.835
- Oh, god, will you forget the broom?
- But the broken glass.

37:51.870 --> 37:54.200
Forget the glass!
We got to get out of here!

37:54.932 --> 37:56.629
Adrian...

38:06.909 --> 38:08.590
Sharona?

38:08.625 --> 38:09.969
Sharona?

38:10.004 --> 38:12.264
Too smart for your own good, Mr. Monk.

38:12.299 --> 38:15.196
You should have let sleeping dogs lie.

38:17.225 --> 38:18.937
Where do you think you're going?

38:18.972 --> 38:21.351
I'm not done with you yet.

38:40.310 --> 38:43.098
- Sharona.
- Oh...Adrian.

38:43.133 --> 38:44.757
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
You're okay.

38:44.792 --> 38:46.623
No, no. Just stay there.
Don't try and move.

38:46.658 --> 38:50.446
- You've got to get out of here.
- Shh. Don't worry about me.

38:50.481 --> 38:53.195
I'm wearing the goggles.

38:55.459 --> 38:58.946
- Yes.
- Monk?

39:00.120 --> 39:03.977
You can't hide from me forever.

39:04.012 --> 39:07.693
I'm over here, Winston.

39:07.728 --> 39:11.995
Or am I over here?

39:12.030 --> 39:15.371
Be careful. Your left shoe
lace is untied.

39:16.878 --> 39:18.596
How did you know that?

39:18.631 --> 39:19.962
What's going on?

39:24.626 --> 39:26.839
Boo.

39:30.593 --> 39:33.651
Hey! Get those lights
back on now!

39:38.851 --> 39:42.533
Maybe...
I'm a ghost.

40:07.882 --> 40:12.132
- You can see me, can't you?
- Yeah.

40:12.935 --> 40:17.351
- The lights are on, aren't they?
- Yep.

40:18.973 --> 40:20.797
- Brenner!
- Sharona, you okay?

40:20.832 --> 40:22.020
Drop the knife.

40:23.186 --> 40:25.592
Lieutenant, these are
night-vision goggles.

40:25.627 --> 40:26.977
Turn the lights back off.

40:27.012 --> 40:29.200
I'll have the advantage.
Turn them off!

40:29.235 --> 40:32.982
Yeah, we could do that...
or we could just arrest him.

40:37.990 --> 40:41.255
Okay. Yeah. All right.
Just arrest him.

40:41.290 --> 40:44.942
Yeah, let's.
Winston brenner, you're under arrest.

40:44.977 --> 40:46.671
Give me your other hand.

40:46.706 --> 40:50.147
You have the right to remain silent.
I suggest you do so.

41:00.089 --> 41:02.993
As you know, Winston brenner,
also known as Gene edelson,

41:03.028 --> 41:05.570
was indicted this morning
in federal district court.

41:05.605 --> 41:07.844
The San francisco power company would like

41:07.845 --> 41:10.456
to thank the ATF, the
FBI, and the local police

41:10.491 --> 41:13.066
for their dedication and professionalism.

41:13.101 --> 41:16.941
We especially would like to thank
former detective Adrian Monk,

41:16.976 --> 41:20.693
who was instrumental in bringing
this fugitive to justice.

41:20.728 --> 41:22.665
Thank you.

41:22.700 --> 41:24.710
Thank you.

41:25.978 --> 41:29.723
Adrian? - Don't worry, I didn't
come to ask you out again.

41:29.758 --> 41:34.636
I, I wanted you to have
these... a dozen roses.

41:34.671 --> 41:36.942
You deserve all 12.

41:36.977 --> 41:38.489
But they're all different.

41:38.524 --> 41:40.307
They're your problem now.

41:42.147 --> 41:44.405
Ah, Adrian, you're
such a sweet man.

41:44.440 --> 41:46.852
And whenever you work through
whatever it is

41:46.887 --> 41:50.806
that you're working through,

41:50.841 --> 41:54.332
would you call me?

41:55.039 --> 41:59.530
You mean you, you'd go
out with me again? - Sure.

41:59.565 --> 42:02.903
- But only on the ground floor.
- Huh...

42:04.027 --> 42:08.832
If I didn't have cooties,
I'd kiss you right now.

42:10.044 --> 42:13.934
If you didn't have cooties,
I'd let you.

42:16.111 --> 42:19.232
- Well, see you.
- Bye.
