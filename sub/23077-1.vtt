-Our tardiness would be my fault ma'am.
See I was passing out food in the slums...

12:24.694 --> 12:28.318
...when Aseem came up to me and he's like:
'Basu, we should go we can't be late.

12:28.444 --> 12:33.902
We mustn't be late.'
But i sort of just kept ignoring him and kept feeding those kids in the slums.

12:34.028 --> 12:35.277
I am sorry.

12:35.402 --> 12:39.235
-Who's the new charmer.

19:40.410 --> 19:44.369
Your side may represent the bride,
but you may loose the groom.

19:44.494 --> 19:47.577
you are probably right,I am terrible
I cause disclose Everything.

19:47.702 --> 19:49.661
Maybe you are not as bad as you think you are.

19:49.786 --> 19:52.619
Maybe this music is slowing off my mojo.

19:52.744 --> 19:55.827
Maybe the DJ is my friend,
I can tell him put on something else.

19:59.953 --> 20:02.869
Thanks, but I said no.

20:02.994 --> 20:04.994

I'd get it.

20:05.119 --> 20:09.078
But there's gonna be a extra class
for the senior ladies tomorrow.

20:09.203 --> 20:13.911
You know the ones with bad knees, tone deaf
Absolutely no rhythm.

20:15.578 --> 20:17.662
You can join them.

This monument was built
as a welcome sign to visitors, when they first arrived.

24:22.041 --> 24:24.958
And it was the last thing that they saw
when they departed.

24:28.500 --> 24:32.375

-Um ma'am Traditionally, it's the bride who wears red.

32:48.052 --> 32:50.676
And white is for mourning.

32:50.802 --> 32:52.551
-And do I look happy to you?

32:52.676 --> 32:55.177
-We have enough colors

Sure I've studied that in Geography.

46:32.568 --> 46:34.151
Are you hungry?

46:34.176 --> 46:36.401
The best street food from Mumbai,
Right here.

46:37.526 --> 46:40.652
Alright I heard you are not gonna supposed to eat the street meal.

46:40.677 --> 46:44.010
That's advisable.
But my advice now overrules so...

46:50.762 --> 46:52.081

Lekin abhi k liye ek veg kabab..(But for now we'll have a veg kabab...)

46:59.827 --> 47:04.202

-Aapki dost bahut aachi hai ha. (Your friend is very beautiful.)

47:06.486 --> 47:08.319
What did he say?

47:08.319 --> 47:10.277
Uh...Do not eat the street food.

47:15.402 --> 47:17.235
Deepika really likes you.

47:18.985 --> 47:20.818
I know.

47:20.944 --> 47:23.653
She and I've been dancing together since we were ten.

47:23.811 --> 47:24.811
Yeah

47:24.902 --> 47:26.903
She is a Wonderful woman.

47:27.027 --> 47:28.903

47:29.027 --> 47:31.361
 ... she'll make someone really happy someday.

47:36.536 --> 47:42.119
So, why do some call this Bombay
and others Mumbai?

47:42.444 --> 47:45.402
The name has changed in 1996.

47:45.427 --> 47:48.053
For political reasons Mainly.

47:48.178 --> 47:52.886
But some of the locals
They can take quiet a bit of time to catch up.

47:53.111 --> 47:55.819
But i'm not offending anyone by saying Mumbai, am I?

47:58.031 --> 47:59.031
-No

48:00.445 --> 48:02.612
Old traditions die hard in India.

48:02.636 --> 48:06.928
Like the caste system. But young India
We know that our traditions are out of date.

48:07.153 --> 48:09.778
But things are changing, and I.. we are changing.

48:11.153 --> 48:13.986
But yet we do things on Indian time.

48:14.111 --> 48:16.528
A little behind.

48:18.320 --> 48:22.737
How did you got in all this?
-My grandfather used to sing in the fields when i was growing up.

48:23.904 --> 48:27.111
In Jalihal, Just east of Texas.

48:27.237 --> 48:28.570
Exactly.

48:29.904 --> 48:32.403
We would go watch Bollywood movies together.

48:32.528 --> 48:34.654
And I got hooked.

48:34.779 --> 48:39.279
I would rehearse the steps, I would learn them.
And then I would make up my Own.

48:39.387 --> 48:43.812
And then Basu... he became my elfed music.

48:44.038 --> 48:48.246
Then one day we just... decided to pursue our dreams.

48:50.229 --> 48:52.230
What did your parents think?

48:53.654 --> 48:57.571
My mother never really recovered
from the complications of my birth.

48:59.038 --> 49:00.704
I'm sorry.

49:01.029 --> 49:03.987
I don't remember her that well.

49:04.012 --> 49:05.680
Not at all, Infact.

49:05.704 --> 49:09.371
My father though,
I remember him.

49:09.496 --> 49:10.954
He was a good man.

49:10.979 --> 49:13.021
He worked hard...

49:13.146 --> 49:16.522
... but his heart never really recovered,
from the loss of my mother.

49:17.780 --> 49:19.988
He never opened up to me either.

49:22.188 --> 49:24.188
But I had my grandparents.

49:26.072 --> 49:28.404
You don't let anything stop you?

49:32.239 --> 49:35.780
I really control how we handle the things life throws at us.

And that's why I'm here.

I go back to school.

It was amazing.

01:03:30.405 --> 01:03:32.405
I don't wanna go to law school.

01:03:33.546 --> 01:03:36.047

-I'm tired of lying.

01:03:36.172 --> 01:03:38.130
Well, that's a relief.

01:03:38.255 --> 01:03:41.464
Alright maybe this isn't the right time, we are all tired.
-Then then is?

01:03:42.506 --> 01:03:47.339
Each day I don't tell you what i'm feeling,
is a lie and I can't pretend anymore.

01:03:48.297 --> 01:03:51.172
Dad wants me happy.
-Of course he does, we both do.

01:03:51.297 --> 01:03:54.130
And he wants you happy.

01:03:54.255 --> 01:03:56.214
What does that mean?

01:03:56.339 --> 01:04:00.922
Look it's not your choice on whether I dance or not,
but it is your choice on how you are gonna handle it if i do.

01:04:02.255 --> 01:04:03.355
It is that boy, isn't it?

01:04:03.355 --> 01:04:04.255

01:04:04.607 --> 01:04:05.607
No.

01:04:05.607 --> 01:04:09.507
We don't remind you that everything you think you are feeling right now,
is going to an end when we leave.

01:04:09.514 --> 01:04:11.889
You don't hear a word I say.
-None of this is real.

01:04:12.014 --> 01:04:15.222
Real?,
It's as real as anything we do.

01:04:16.547 --> 01:04:20.215
Who we're kidding?
Dad says this trip is for a family break.

01:04:20.339 --> 01:04:25.048
It's for you and him.
He has tried Hawaii, the Caribbean, New York.

01:04:26.965 --> 01:04:30.006
Ever since Henry died, we are all
hanging up by a thread.

01:04:30.848 --> 01:04:36.639
And you Mom, you walk around a
numb to the world with a fake smile on your face.

01:04:36.765 --> 01:04:39.473
But we know you, Mom.

01:04:39.798 --> 01:04:41.881

You are not dressed.
We are gonna be late for dinner.

01:10:45.855 --> 01:10:48.205
One day it will be her getting married.

01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:51.100
And just like that she'll be gone.

01:10:53.772 --> 01:10:54.972
What are you doing?

01:10:55.118 --> 01:10:56.385
-What are we doing?

01:10:56.930 --> 01:10:59.768
Tell me, please,
because I don''t know,
I really don't know anymore.

01:10:59.930 --> 01:11:02.523
You have been drinking.
-Yeah

01:11:02.581 --> 01:11:04.581
But not enough to stop feeling.

01:11:06.431 --> 01:11:08.139
Kelly is right.

01:11:10.523 --> 01:11:13.314
And she was brave enough to say,
What we couldn't.

01:11:19.121 --> 01:11:20.421

01:11:23.221 --> 01:11:24.221

01:11:32.681 --> 01:11:34.390
... and need us.

01:11:37.265 --> 01:11:39.015
And I need you.

01:11:43.673 --> 01:11:45.915
I need you to be here.

01:11:47.890 --> 01:11:50.515
I'm here, Richard.

01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:52.082
I am here.

01:11:53.915 --> 01:11:56.415

01:11:57.215 --> 01:12:00.756

For you.

01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:05.390

I'm here for my daughters too.

01:12:09.849 --> 01:12:13.682
I can't keep mourning our son.

01:12:15.083 --> 01:12:16.582
We can't.

01:12:18.308 --> 01:12:19.932
Look at us.

01:12:21.016 --> 01:12:23.391
We need to live our lives.

01:12:27.961 --> 01:12:29.361

What are you doing here?
-Something happened with mom and dad.

01:13:25.234 --> 01:13:28.234
I have never seen them like this before.
-Baby,I'm sorry.We've gotta get you back to the Hotel.

01:13:28.559 --> 01:13:32.359
No I don't want to. I want to be here with you.
-We're talking when I'm done, Okay.
-No...

01:13:32.359 --> 01:13:33.942
I'm not going.

01:13:36.975 --> 01:13:38.475
I must be crazy.
Come on.

01:13:40.942 --> 01:13:44.117
Something happened with my parents,
She is really upset.

01:13:44.142 --> 01:13:45.642
I'm Sorry, I didn't know what else to do.

01:13:45.643 --> 01:13:48.243

Okay, but if the boss men asks,
I do not know who she is.

It's okay, I trust him.

Stay right with him, okay?

01:14:18.668 --> 01:14:20.793

-I don't dance with Slum Dogs.

01:18:49.524 --> 01:18:52.898
Although you seemed to enjoy it.
-You're an asshole.

01:18:56.759 --> 01:18:57.759
Morgen?...

01:19:03.193 --> 01:19:04.193

01:19:08.565 --> 01:19:11.941
Kelly, are you okay?
-Where'd she left? She was right here.

01:19:12.066 --> 01:19:13.565
Maybe she went out.

01:19:13.565 --> 01:19:14.674

01:19:22.732 --> 01:19:26.941
Back off. back off. Who started this?
Who the hell threw the first punch?

01:19:27.066 --> 01:19:29.565
He did.
-You calm the people down.

01:19:29.690 --> 01:19:32.066
Dance naked on the bar, if you have to
-Go.

01:19:32.091 --> 01:19:34.461
And you
You really disappointed me, my boy.

01:19:34.461 --> 01:19:36.461
-Please, my sister, she's lost.

01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:39.866
Look for the girl.

01:19:41.085 --> 01:19:42.085
Morgen...

01:19:42.982 --> 01:19:46.441
She is almost 5 feet tall.
-Your sister?

01:19:46.566 --> 01:19:48.352
How old is she?
-She is 12.
-Kelly.

01:19:48.352 --> 01:19:49.252
Dad..

01:19:49.300 --> 01:19:51.966
Where's Morgen?
She hasen't called, she hasen't texted.

01:19:52.091 --> 01:19:55.466
Where was she seen lost?
-She was in the club, in the far back.

01:19:55.492 --> 01:19:57.700
She was underaged and in a club?

01:19:58.025 --> 01:19:59.654
That's a crime in my city.

01:19:59.654 --> 01:20:01.689
Officer, could you just let them find the child first.

01:20:01.742 --> 01:20:03.174
We'll deal with that later.

01:20:03.227 --> 01:20:04.227
-Okay.
-Momma.

01:20:05.733 --> 01:20:08.692
She was hiding in Klaneh's office.
-Are you Okay, Are you Hurt?

01:20:08.817 --> 01:20:12.150
No, i'm fine, but don't be mad at Kelly,
it wasn't her fault.

01:20:12.275 --> 01:20:15.992
You,
You brought them to this club, you should be ashamed at yourself.

01:20:16.061 --> 01:20:17.811
What do you think you can get a quick score
with a girl on vacation?

01:20:17.811 --> 01:20:18.811
Dad...

01:20:19.067 --> 01:20:22.275
Stay away from my daughter.  -Dad..No..
Kelly, get in the car.

01:20:23.275 --> 01:20:25.192
I said, get in the car.

01:20:25.709 --> 01:20:26.834
Now.

01:20:33.234 --> 01:20:34.817
You are right, sir.

01:20:34.817 --> 01:20:36.779
This is my fault, not Kelly's.

01:20:40.228 --> 01:20:41.228
Yeah..

01:20:42.025 --> 01:20:43.609
Let's go.

01:20:44.609 --> 01:20:46.776
Thank you Officer.
Sorry for all the trouble.

01:20:46.901 --> 01:20:49.943
I'm gonna take a taxi back.
-Be careful.   -Okay.

01:20:54.359 --> 01:20:56.188
You got fired from Big Crazy,
And I should fire you too.

01:20:56.937 --> 01:20:59.317
You do not take Guest's out,
And have them nearly Arrested.

01:20:59.342 --> 01:21:02.010
Last time it was my fault ma'am,
If you wanna fire someone fire me.
Let's don't fire Aseem...

01:21:02.235 --> 01:21:05.442
Look,
Look it was my fault.

01:21:05.467 --> 01:21:08.176
I took Kelly there,
and knew her sister was gonna be there.

01:21:08.202 --> 01:21:10.701
But there's no reason for your family to suffer Sir.

01:21:10.726 --> 01:21:12.726
Let me make comments.

01:21:12.951 --> 01:21:15.993
Let's make this date as beautiful as we can
for your son sir.

01:21:16.018 --> 01:21:19.102
And you won't even have to pay us.
-Right.

01:21:19.527 --> 01:21:21.443
Wait, what?

01:21:21.568 --> 01:21:24.235
To honour the obligation's,
We'll work for free.

01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:26.777
Harindar, may I call security?

01:21:26.901 --> 01:21:29.393
Yes, for this emergency.
Aseem, have you lost your mind?

01:21:29.443 --> 01:21:30.443
Papa.

01:21:33.502 --> 01:21:36.843
If there is a problem,
any problem...

01:21:37.468 --> 01:21:40.177
 ...My brother knows someone
who will hurt you.

01:21:40.202 --> 01:21:43.051
Yes, starting with me.

01:21:43.277 --> 01:21:46.277
And you.. have to stay away from that girl.

01:21:46.402 --> 01:21:49.694
Your reputation is short as it is,
don't make things worse.

01:22:01.944 --> 01:22:04.777
Why get paid
when you can work for free, right?

01:22:05.944 --> 01:22:07.610

There's no need to be.

01:27:44.601 --> 01:27:46.518
I had a good run, Kelly.

01:27:47.443 --> 01:27:49.900
I got paid to dance in Bombay.

01:27:50.326 --> 01:27:52.534
For the three years that I was here.

01:27:52.659 --> 01:27:56.743
I mean how many people can actually say
that they got paid to do what they love?

01:28:00.243 --> 01:28:02.118

He has no rhythm,no beat
no sense of timing, nothing whatsoever.

01:29:35.661 --> 01:29:38.661
I should have like just kept running away from him,
that would have been easier.

01:29:42.153 --> 01:29:44.712
What are you doing?
-What does it look like?

01:29:47.953 --> 01:29:51.078
I know advice from me isn't always the best.

01:29:52.628 --> 01:29:55.045
Okay perhap's it's never the best.

01:29:55.370 --> 01:29:59.037
Okay i know i suck at advice,
but i'm gonna offer you now some anyway.

01:29:59.062 --> 01:30:01.645
Aseem, you are crazy to give up.

But yesterday, we had a.. really great talk.

01:31:26.789 --> 01:31:29.455
And we agreed...

01:31:29.580 --> 01:31:32.747
... that if dance is something you want to do with,
then you can do it or not.

01:31:32.872 --> 01:31:36.081
And we don't need to talk about it.
-You can't change who you are.

Dad we don't want that sweet heart.

01:31:39.164 --> 01:31:43.164

It's the only thing you can do.

01:31:43.289 --> 01:31:46.581
