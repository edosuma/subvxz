We thought it looked fun.
Is your cell phone in your pocket?

20:20.886 --> 20:23.719
Yeah, but I can't reach it.
I can only move my right arm.

20:23.922 --> 20:25.184
Okay. There's money
already in there.

20:25.390 --> 20:27.950
Slide your arm through
that bottom slot
and press the button G-1 4.

20:28.160 --> 20:30.856
When a snack is selected,
the mechanical lever that's holding it
will be thrust forward,

20:31.063 --> 20:33.623
thereby knocking your cell phone
out of your pocket
and into the receptacle below.

20:33.832 --> 20:35.561
We could pick it up and call for help.

20:35.767 --> 20:36.825
Here we go.

20:37.035 --> 20:38.468

20:44.476 --> 20:45.670
Troy?

20:45.877 --> 20:48.277
I think I hit G-1 3.
