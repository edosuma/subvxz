00:18.749 --> 00:22.150
- Yeah, Lewis. He's in
the holding area, back there.

00:22.219 --> 00:24.153
Got it.

00:28.225 --> 00:30.750
Here you go.

00:30.828 --> 00:32.921
Dominic Gennaro, Sarge.
I'm on a job.

00:32.997 --> 00:35.557
- Janice Licalsi around?
- Yeah, in the complaint room.

00:35.633 --> 00:37.567
Thank you.

00:42.606 --> 00:45.040
How you doin', cookie?

00:45.109 --> 00:49.546
Good, Daddy.

00:49.613 --> 00:52.548
- Is everything okay at home?
- Yeah, Mom's good.

00:55.452 --> 00:57.386
What's up?

00:57.454 --> 01:00.890
I wanted to see you before
you found something out.

01:00.958 --> 01:04.485
They're gonna make an announcement
this afternoon.

01:04.561 --> 01:07.325
Some cops
are gonna be indicted.

01:07.398 --> 01:09.389
I'm gonna be one of them.

01:12.036 --> 01:16.132
It's out of this Giardella
testimony with the grand jury.

01:16.206 --> 01:19.869
They're gonna say I took money from
Angelo Marino, I was on his payroll.

01:24.548 --> 01:26.812
How come you don't ask
if it's true?

01:29.887 --> 01:32.583
Tell me what
you want to tell me.

01:32.656 --> 01:35.523
They paid me
for giving up warrants.

01:35.592 --> 01:39.153
When I was on gambling
and narcotics...

01:39.229 --> 01:41.493
I tipped them if there
was gonna be a raid.

01:42.900 --> 01:46.529
It's been over for five
years, but I did it.

01:46.603 --> 01:50.699
Now I'm glad when you joined
the force you used Mom's name.

01:50.774 --> 01:53.174
How you feel personally
is one thing,

01:53.243 --> 01:55.438
but at least nobody's
gonna know we're related.

01:55.512 --> 01:57.742
I'm not ashamed
to be your daughter.

02:02.686 --> 02:05.621
I want you to know
I'm proud of you.

02:05.689 --> 02:10.455
I've always been proud of the way you
carried yourself and the kind of cop you are.

02:10.526 --> 02:13.325
I'll always be glad
for that part, anyway...

02:13.397 --> 02:18.130
that these bastards
never reached out to you.

02:24.375 --> 02:28.471
You okay? You got someone
you can talk to, you know?

02:28.545 --> 02:30.877
Yeah, Daddy, I'm fine.

04:41.239 --> 04:44.174
Sipowicz, what
are you doin' here?

04:44.242 --> 04:47.109
I heard a rumor the rat
you're watchin' is leavin' town.

04:47.178 --> 04:50.238
- Keep him inside, Jerry.
- Is that right... they're taking Giardella to D. C?

04:50.314 --> 04:52.339
- That's none of your business.
- Oh, sure.

04:52.416 --> 04:54.611
Just 'cause that son of a bitch
put six bullets in my gut...

04:54.685 --> 04:56.778
doesn't mean I should wonder
what's goin' on.

04:56.854 --> 05:00.654
I know what Giardella did to you,
but you can't be coming around here.

05:00.725 --> 05:04.183
Detective, if you're not out of here
in 30 seconds, you'll be under arrest.

05:04.262 --> 05:08.494
How's it goin', Alfonse? You hidin' under
the bed covers, you lowlife piece of crap?

05:08.566 --> 05:13.003
What is it, Sipowicz?
You wanna see the rest of my suite?

05:13.070 --> 05:16.369
Oh, there it is.
The ugliest wig in America.

05:16.440 --> 05:20.877
Hey, douche bag, I got 24-hour room
service and three dirty movie channels.

05:20.945 --> 05:25.609
Yeah? How'd you like to watch 'em from
a hole in the middle of your forehead?

05:25.683 --> 05:27.810
Get out of here, Sipowicz!

05:27.885 --> 05:30.217
Hey, that's a good look
for you, Alfonse!

05:30.288 --> 05:34.190
- Why don't you mix that mud in with your rug?
- He's a savage, this guy.

05:34.258 --> 05:37.625
I'm not done with you, Giardella.
You and me are going around again.

05:37.695 --> 05:40.357
- Do not come back here!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:42.867 --> 05:44.801
Sign it right here.

05:44.869 --> 05:46.837
- Hey, what's up?
- Thanks.

05:46.904 --> 05:49.839
Detective Kelly,
is this gonna go on forever?

05:49.907 --> 05:51.841
What's that?

05:51.909 --> 05:53.843
You pretending I don't exist.

05:53.911 --> 05:56.345
You got real guts, you know that?

05:56.414 --> 06:00.248
Figure yourself lucky I don't collar you
for homicide. Stay away from me, all right?

06:00.318 --> 06:03.185
Could I just talk to you?
I need to talk to you!

06:03.254 --> 06:05.586
No, you don't.
I understand what happened.

06:05.656 --> 06:08.420
You were dirty.
You were gettin' squeezed.

06:08.492 --> 06:11.825
You whacked Marino to get loose,
and now you're gonna get away with it.

06:11.896 --> 06:14.865
John, you're the only one
I can talk to.

06:14.932 --> 06:17.765
I can't, okay?

06:17.835 --> 06:21.430
- Hey.
- Yeah. Yeah.

06:21.505 --> 06:24.838
- Regards from Harry Timmons.
- Yeah? How's he doin'?

06:24.909 --> 06:27.309
- How's his security business?
- It's doing great, I guess.

06:27.378 --> 06:30.438
- He got any night work for you?
- I'm bodyguardin' some society people.

06:30.514 --> 06:32.483
I'm meeting 'em tonight.

06:32.617 --> 06:34.915
It's too bad I make
such a lousy appearance.

06:34.986 --> 06:38.183
As busy as I am around here,
I could've worked a double shift.

06:38.256 --> 06:41.885
Andy, stay cool, all right? Fancy wants
to make sure you got your feet under you.

06:41.959 --> 06:44.189
- That's all.
- Oh, you think so, huh?

06:44.262 --> 06:48.494
I figure he's seeing if I can set a
world's record for twiddlin' my thumbs.

06:48.566 --> 06:53.003
- Andy. Andy, would you mind keepin' an eye on Luther again?
- Yeah? Ahh.

06:53.071 --> 06:56.165
Come on, Medavoy, what am I,
a kennel service here? Huh?

06:56.240 --> 07:00.802
- I can't leave him home alone, and the wife's gone till Friday.
- All right, all right.

07:00.878 --> 07:03.210
- Is he in the locker room?
- Yeah, yeah. You got the scooper?

07:03.281 --> 07:06.114
- Yeah, I got the scooper. Yeah.
- You're a prince.

07:06.184 --> 07:10.211
Kelly, you got a residential
robbery-assault, maybe a homicide by now.

07:10.288 --> 07:12.756
They didn't think
the victim was gonna make it.

07:12.824 --> 07:15.725
- Who should I work with?
- Martinez.

07:15.793 --> 07:17.852
Sipowicz, my office.

07:28.039 --> 07:30.098
Close the door.

07:34.545 --> 07:38.208
- I just had a call from the Federal Marshals.
- Is that so?

07:38.282 --> 07:40.807
What the hell were you doing
at Giardella's hotel?

07:40.885 --> 07:43.479
I was in the neighborhood.
I thought I'd say hello.

07:43.554 --> 07:48.253
I don't get you. You know you're
on probation, and you put on a Bozo act.

07:48.326 --> 07:51.124
- That asshole shot me, Lieutenant.
- I know he shot you...

07:51.195 --> 07:54.164
And now the D.A.'s puttin' him up in
some joint where I can't afford coffee.

07:54.232 --> 07:56.723
I agree. They never should
have cut Giardella a deal.

07:56.801 --> 07:59.861
- But I'm not supposed to be pissed off?
- You can be pissed off.

07:59.937 --> 08:03.998
What you can't do is go down there
and try to brain him with a plant.

08:04.075 --> 08:09.069
I used bad judgment, all right?
Look, maybe if I was a little busier...

08:09.147 --> 08:11.274
It's like the chicken
and the egg.

08:11.349 --> 08:14.785
First you stop acting like a flake,
then maybe you get back on the street.

08:14.852 --> 08:19.186
Lieutenant, I've been takin' the psycho
calls, filin' the stop-and-frisk reports...

08:19.257 --> 08:21.418
You want a gold star?

08:21.492 --> 08:24.859
Is that bein'a flake, huh? How long
is this probation thing gonna go on?

08:24.929 --> 08:29.491
I told you, I'm giving myself
time to make up my mind.

08:29.567 --> 08:32.365
I think you've already
made up your mind, Lieutenant.

08:32.436 --> 08:35.871
And I think you're tryin'
to screw me from behind that desk.

08:42.413 --> 08:44.973
- Did you sign it?
- Yeah, it's ready to go.

08:45.049 --> 08:49.076
You know what, fellas?

08:49.153 --> 08:53.988
I'm considering a whole new, uh,
organizational approach on my work area here.

08:54.058 --> 08:56.356
You see this section
here, huh?

08:56.427 --> 08:59.487
This quadrant I may reserve
for, for these...

08:59.564 --> 09:02.863
these little yellow note reminders
with the glue on the back, you know?

09:02.934 --> 09:05.869
And over here, this area
I think I'm gonna restrict...

09:05.937 --> 09:08.303
to, uh, paper weights
and animal magnets...

09:08.372 --> 09:10.670
maybe those little giraffes.

09:10.741 --> 09:13.574
- All right, very funny.
- Nobody's bein' funny here.

09:13.644 --> 09:16.010
I'm tryin' to figure out
my work schedule here.

09:16.080 --> 09:18.981
I mean, I'm under an enormous
time pressure, you know.

09:19.050 --> 09:21.416
I mean, I-I gotta
reorganize my desk.

09:21.485 --> 09:23.919
I gotta walk
Medavoy's dog here.

09:23.988 --> 09:27.151
Hey, Lieutenant, if it stays
this hectic around here,

09:27.225 --> 09:29.955
would I be okayed for overtime?

09:30.027 --> 09:33.656
Why don't the two of us
get together after work?

09:33.731 --> 09:36.598
- No ranks?
- No ranks. Just folks.

09:36.667 --> 09:39.227
- Why wait?
- After work.

09:43.040 --> 09:45.304
Kelly, you got an assignment.

09:45.376 --> 09:47.435
Detective Medavoy here.
I'm sOrry...

09:49.046 --> 09:51.241
- Give me another minute.
- Sure.

09:52.917 --> 09:55.511
Yeah, I'm waitin'to go on...

09:55.586 --> 09:58.077
His Highness
hasn't finished his meal yet.

09:58.155 --> 10:00.316
What was that about with Fancy?

10:00.391 --> 10:04.225
Me and the lieutenant are gonna get together
after work, get to know each other better.

10:04.295 --> 10:07.890
Andy.

10:07.965 --> 10:13.403
Andy! You are on thin ice with this guy
already. How is this gonna help you?

10:13.471 --> 10:17.100
Hey, look, I've been in this precinct
for 17 years, John, you know.

10:17.174 --> 10:19.438
I got informants
on every other block.

10:19.510 --> 10:23.276
I know every merchant, every skel,
all the good guys, all the bad guys.

10:23.347 --> 10:25.679
Plus I wanna work with you again.

10:25.750 --> 10:28.480
But if the only way
to get back on the street...

10:28.552 --> 10:33.012
because that African-American hump
in there won't give me a square shot...

10:33.090 --> 10:35.923
is to put in for a transfer,
then that's what I'm gonna do.

10:35.993 --> 10:39.895
And if that's what I gotta do, I'm gonna
get my two cents in before I go, John.

10:42.133 --> 10:45.899
Now go on, get outta here.
You got a case.

10:45.970 --> 10:48.962
Go on, get out.

10:51.575 --> 10:54.442
Who are you starin' at?

10:55.613 --> 10:58.047
Is that gonna be
all right, Detective?

10:58.115 --> 11:00.447
I don't know, Martinez.
I don't know.

11:06.624 --> 11:09.320
It's terrible.

11:09.393 --> 11:12.226
Figure the basement window
for the entry?

11:12.296 --> 11:15.231
- Yeah.
- All right, let's start the canvass here.

11:15.299 --> 11:17.233
You okay?

11:17.301 --> 11:20.395
Her face goin' colors like that,
that's the air gettin' cut off?

11:20.471 --> 11:23.702
That's the air gettin' cut off.

11:23.774 --> 11:26.868
Ma'am, I'm John Kelly.

11:26.944 --> 11:29.412
That's James Martinez.
We're from the 15 Precinct.

11:29.480 --> 11:31.846
She's dead?

11:31.916 --> 11:33.907
- Lois Ceizler?
- Yeah.

11:33.985 --> 11:37.887
You mind if I ask your name
and date of birth, ma'am?

11:37.955 --> 11:42.688
Annette DiLeo,
March 23, 1935.

11:42.760 --> 11:46.196
Okay. You live
in the house alone?

11:46.263 --> 11:48.857
Uh, I live
with my oldest son, Michael.

11:48.933 --> 11:51.060
- Uh, he's...
- Nobody there...

11:51.135 --> 11:55.367
was born on April 7, 1967.

11:55.439 --> 11:57.839
Do you have
the same last name?

11:57.908 --> 12:00.342
Why, yes.

12:00.411 --> 12:03.278
Mrs. DiLeo, is there
any information you can give me?

12:03.347 --> 12:06.145
Anything unusual happen
next door this morning?

12:06.217 --> 12:10.347
I was out
till half an hour ago.

12:10.421 --> 12:14.551
I saw all the ambulances
and all when I got back,

12:14.625 --> 12:17.150
but I didn't want to interfere.

12:17.228 --> 12:19.492
What time did you leave?

12:19.563 --> 12:22.623
About a quarter after 8:00.
I work half days...

12:22.700 --> 12:24.634
at, uh, Lieman's Bakery.

12:24.702 --> 12:26.636
My son dropped me off.

12:26.704 --> 12:30.265
And Michael... Michael?

12:30.341 --> 12:33.640
Uh, is he home, or, uh,
can I reach him at work?

12:33.711 --> 12:38.080
He-He brought my car back here,
then he went out to see my other son.

12:38.149 --> 12:40.379
Where does he live?

12:40.451 --> 12:43.648
Uh, Jamie?
Lives in Ridgewood...

12:43.721 --> 12:45.985
Yeah, you have
an address on him?

12:46.057 --> 12:50.756
Well, it's on Traltman Street.
I don't know the address.

12:50.828 --> 12:54.491
Either of your boys ever been
in trouble with the police, Mrs. DiLeo?

12:54.565 --> 12:56.590
- No.
- Okay.

12:56.667 --> 12:59.261
- Thank you.
- It's your watch commander...

12:59.336 --> 13:02.100
I'm going to, uh,
give you my card.

13:02.173 --> 13:06.200
And if you can think of anything that
might be helpful, you'll give me a call?

13:06.277 --> 13:08.802
- Yes.
- Thanks again.

13:13.884 --> 13:17.342
- I'm gonna check for messages.
- What kind of messages?

13:18.823 --> 13:21.883
I want to run a B.C.I.
On these two brothers.

13:21.959 --> 13:25.326
- 15 Squad, Base K.
- Yeah, I want to run a B.C.I. On a Ridgewood address.

13:25.396 --> 13:28.092
- Take care of that thing for me? Great.
- James orJamie DiLeo.

13:28.165 --> 13:31.532
D-I-L-E-O.
Caucasian, early 20s.

13:31.602 --> 13:37.234
Also Michael, same last name,
26, 62 Bank Street, Manhattan.

13:37.308 --> 13:41.574
- 15 Squad, stand by.
- 26 years old, no job, living at home.

13:41.645 --> 13:44.739
- Maybe that's a junkie savin' on rent.
- Yeah. Plus...

13:44.815 --> 13:48.182
- Plus he brought the car back. That's what she said, right?
- Yeah.

13:48.252 --> 13:50.186
15 Squad on the air.

13:50.254 --> 13:53.519
Your address in Ridgewood
is 1447 Traltman Street.

13:53.591 --> 13:56.389
- Priors on both names.
- Bingo.

14:27.491 --> 14:29.425
Yeah.

14:29.493 --> 14:33.054
Yes, yes, I'm coming.

14:33.130 --> 14:35.860
You the super?

14:35.933 --> 14:38.834
- You got a James DiLeo in 3J?
- What did he do?

14:38.903 --> 14:41.736
I'm not sure yet.
Where's his fire escape located?

14:41.805 --> 14:44.239
Out his window.
It drops into the side alley.

14:44.308 --> 14:47.209
Whatever you want to talk to him
about, he probably did it.

14:47.278 --> 14:50.179
The kid lives
like an animal.

14:51.749 --> 14:53.842
How're you doing, Mr. DiLeo?

14:53.918 --> 14:57.183
- Police! I got him!
- I got outside.

15:09.833 --> 15:12.165
Mike, cops! Get out!

15:15.973 --> 15:18.271
Stop!

15:20.377 --> 15:23.744
Freeze, asshole! Freeze!

15:23.814 --> 15:25.782
No, Martinez!

15:25.849 --> 15:29.080
- James, are you all right?
- Yeah.

15:29.153 --> 15:32.316
- What are you, a circus cop?
- Yeah. Flying James Martinez.

15:32.389 --> 15:35.153
Hang in there.

15:35.226 --> 15:38.923
And now to our own
Lanny Chrisman with details...

15:38.996 --> 15:41.658
- Here you go.
- On thosejust-announced indictments...

15:41.732 --> 15:44.633
- Thanks.
- Of New York City police officers.

15:44.702 --> 15:47.170
- Early this afternoon...
- They indicted 14 cops.

15:47.238 --> 15:50.264
The district attorney announced the
indictment of 14 New York City police officers.

15:50.341 --> 15:53.276
- Anybody from our precinct?
- The grand jury testimony of organized crime leader...

15:53.344 --> 15:55.278
- What you got?
- Alfonse Giardella.

15:55.346 --> 15:57.906
- We like these,
uh, these DiLeo brothers.

15:57.982 --> 16:00.348
They both use.
They both got sheets for burglary.

16:00.417 --> 16:03.386
- Any violence?
- No, I think they were just doing a robbery.

16:03.454 --> 16:05.513
The old lady surprised them.

16:05.589 --> 16:08.057
Tell Narcotics
to let the junkies know...

16:08.125 --> 16:10.992
there's a walk for anybody
that gives these guys up.

16:11.061 --> 16:13.495
Okay.

16:15.733 --> 16:18.566
Martinez, would you reach out
to Narcotics, please?

16:18.636 --> 16:21.161
No problem.

16:21.272 --> 16:23.172
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:23.240 --> 16:25.538
- 4B.
- Hi.

16:25.609 --> 16:29.909
- How's the nose?
- Would you like to hear something interesting, Detective Kelly?

16:29.980 --> 16:33.177
I'm breathing better than
at any time since adolescence.

16:33.250 --> 16:36.344
- That is interesting.
- I'm here about my gun.

16:36.420 --> 16:39.355
- It was confiscated the other night after the incident.
- Yeah.

16:39.423 --> 16:42.415
Well, I have a hearing in a few hours
before the Police Permit Board,

16:42.493 --> 16:45.792
- and I wonder if I can impose on you to draft up...
- I'm gonna pass, 4B.

16:45.863 --> 16:48.161
- A short statement...
- I'm gonna pass.

16:48.232 --> 16:52.168
- Do you mind if I ask why?
- Well, because I don't think you should have a weapon right now.

16:52.236 --> 16:56.002
I think you'd agree, Detective, that as
matters developed in that laundry room,

16:56.073 --> 16:58.837
- it was pretty lucky that I had my gun with me.
- Maybe. But then again,

16:58.909 --> 17:03.175
if you didn't, then maybe you wouldn't have
been down there doing laundry ten times a week,

17:03.247 --> 17:06.182
waitin' for that mugger to come back
so you could plug him, right?

17:06.250 --> 17:10.846
So because I successfully fought off an
assault, I should forfeit my right to bear arms?

17:10.921 --> 17:15.186
No, what I'm saying is, you were robbed and
beaten up, 4B. That's an awful experience.

17:15.259 --> 17:18.422
- Yeah.
- Some people have to go into treatment to get over it.

17:18.494 --> 17:21.953
Some people never go outside again.
And some people get pissed off,

17:22.031 --> 17:25.297
decide they're gonna square things up,
and they start lookin' for trouble.

17:25.368 --> 17:27.894
Which is what
you think I'm doing?

17:27.971 --> 17:30.963
Try this.

17:31.041 --> 17:34.568
Why don't you forget about your gun
for a while and let things unwind?

17:34.645 --> 17:36.943
No, Detective.

17:37.014 --> 17:40.313
What I'm going to do is pursue
my rights under the Second Amendment.

17:40.384 --> 17:42.284
- Okay.
- Okay.

17:42.353 --> 17:44.821
Thank you for your time.

17:48.992 --> 17:52.291
So you got your coat
hangers hanging from your windows?

17:52.363 --> 17:55.298
Did you string
four hangers per pane?

17:55.366 --> 17:59.325
Radio and ultraviolet
waves, yeah, yeah.

17:59.403 --> 18:03.339
Any attempt whatsoever to control
your mind from beyond your windows,

18:03.407 --> 18:05.602
those hangers are gonna
neutralize, right.

18:05.676 --> 18:08.270
What about the aluminum foil?
Did you cover your ceiling?

18:08.345 --> 18:11.007
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Well, then you're in business.

18:11.081 --> 18:14.414
You got yourself an
alien-thought-proof room there, right.

18:14.485 --> 18:19.422
Look, one other thing effective
with these control rays is, uh,

18:19.490 --> 18:21.720
refuse to think about 'em,
you know?

18:21.792 --> 18:23.987
Take a walk, read a book.

18:24.061 --> 18:26.222
We call that delusion technique.

18:26.296 --> 18:28.457
You fend 'em off
with what you're thinking,

18:28.532 --> 18:30.898
and it gradually
weakens their hold, yeah.

18:30.968 --> 18:32.902
All right, yeah.
Wonderful. Yeah.

18:32.970 --> 18:35.165
Okay, sure thing.
Keep in touch.

18:37.508 --> 18:40.807
Hey, I'm, uh...
I'm on my way out...

18:40.878 --> 18:44.370
to see these, uh, people that
Timmons has me bodyguardin'.

18:44.448 --> 18:47.212
Well, have a dandy time.

18:47.284 --> 18:50.253
- Yeah. Hey.
- Hey.

18:52.923 --> 18:55.255
This thing
with the lieutenant...

18:57.528 --> 19:01.089
My understanding is, you
wanna be back out on the street.

19:01.165 --> 19:04.828
If you can remember what
you're tryin'to accomplish...

19:04.902 --> 19:08.804
when you talk to somebody like him,
then you won't fly off the handle.

19:08.872 --> 19:12.740
- Yeah.
- Focus on what you want.

19:12.810 --> 19:14.744
Then we have control,
you know?

19:14.812 --> 19:18.248
All right. Yeah, I got you,
Kelly. I got your drift.

19:18.315 --> 19:20.875
- Yeah.
- All right. See you later?

19:20.951 --> 19:24.512
Yeah.

19:28.158 --> 19:30.592
Kelly.

19:30.661 --> 19:33.994
We got another
complaint from that lady...

19:41.572 --> 19:44.579
Was your father
one of the cops indicted?

19:44.648 --> 19:48.175
That what you were trying
to tell me this morning?

19:48.252 --> 19:50.686
Oh.

19:50.754 --> 19:53.723
I'm so worried about him.

19:53.791 --> 19:55.725
I'm sorry.

20:11.108 --> 20:16.978
Fortune magazine puts my personal
worth at over $ 250 million, Detective.

20:17.047 --> 20:21.677
Time says that I'm one
of the ten most effective...

20:21.752 --> 20:24.084
private citizens
in the country.

20:24.154 --> 20:28.853
My art collection
is museum quality.

20:28.926 --> 20:33.260
And none of it would mean anything
if my wife were to be jeopardized.

20:33.330 --> 20:35.958
Well, I'll try
not to let that happen.

20:36.033 --> 20:38.433
I hope you do
a little more than try.

20:38.502 --> 20:42.233
I was, uh... That was just a way of
speaking. I won't let anything happen to her.

20:42.306 --> 20:44.968
Oh, Susan, this
is DetectiveJohn Kelly.

20:45.042 --> 20:47.738
- Hi, ma'am.
- How do you do?

20:47.811 --> 20:52.009
Susan will tell you the details of her
evening calendar. Uh, do you own a tuxedo?

20:52.082 --> 20:54.346
- Uh, yes.
- Really?

20:54.418 --> 20:58.013
Well, if that's a fib,
bill me for the rental.

21:00.524 --> 21:02.958
Here's my schedule,
Mr. Kelly.

21:03.027 --> 21:06.087
Do you feel like benefiting the
National Diabetic Fund tomorrow night?

21:06.163 --> 21:09.621
- Sure.
- Is there anything that my husband hasn't told you?

21:09.700 --> 21:11.895
Nothing comes to mind.

21:11.969 --> 21:15.962
So he has made you aware that he's one of
America's most effective private citizens?

21:16.040 --> 21:18.099
That his art collection
is museum quality?

21:18.175 --> 21:20.109
Well, uh, that came up.

21:20.177 --> 21:23.578
Mm, good. Then we're all
on the same page.

21:23.647 --> 21:25.774
So I'll pick you up
at 7:30 tomorrow night.

21:25.849 --> 21:27.783
- 7:30 tomorrow.
- Great.

21:27.851 --> 21:30.877
- I'll send my car for you.
- Okay. All right.

21:39.229 --> 21:41.163
You ready?

21:41.231 --> 21:43.165
Yep.

21:48.238 --> 21:50.297
Catch the door.

21:55.245 --> 21:58.646
Okay, I'm out
from behind my desk.

21:58.716 --> 22:02.516
- We'll see how far.
- What you said this morning was wrong.

22:02.586 --> 22:05.646
I got my personal opinions about you.
I think you're an asshole...

22:05.723 --> 22:09.523
- I think you're an asshole.
- But that hasn't affected how I've treated you on the job.

22:09.593 --> 22:12.653
- You really believe that? You guys make me laugh.
- Yeah, I really believe it.

22:12.730 --> 22:15.062
Now, what guys
would you be referring to?

22:15.132 --> 22:17.862
- Black bosses.
- Well, that didn't take long.

22:17.935 --> 22:20.563
I thought I was supposed to feel
free to express my opinions.

22:20.637 --> 22:23.162
Well, for you, I guess
that means being a bigot.

22:23.240 --> 22:26.175
Hey, I'm not up nights thinkin'
about the two of us out for ribs,

22:26.243 --> 22:28.837
but all I was sayin' is,
you guys live inside the books.

22:28.912 --> 22:32.643
You act like machines. You don't like
somebody, you go after 'em like Robo-humps.

22:32.716 --> 22:37.210
Well, you might think we play it close to the
vest because people are watching for us to mess up.

22:37.287 --> 22:39.312
Oh, makes you nervous,
doesn't it, huh?

22:39.390 --> 22:42.325
Somebody always lookin' over your
shoulders, waitin' for you to make a mistake.

22:42.393 --> 22:45.385
Just how exactly do you figure
I tried to screw you, Sipowicz?

22:45.462 --> 22:48.397
I've watched you crawl inside
a bottle and set up housekeeping.

22:48.465 --> 22:50.933
I've watched you carry on
a private war with some hood...

22:51.001 --> 22:54.334
that made you crazy for reasons
I will never understand.

22:54.405 --> 22:56.532
The truth is,
I've cut you slack...

22:56.607 --> 23:00.202
because you were a good cop
and you were a good teacher.

23:00.277 --> 23:04.907
I could be that again if you would
just get your damn foot off my neck.

23:04.982 --> 23:08.383
For God's sake, I haven't
had a drink in 63 days.

23:08.452 --> 23:11.444
- You goin' to 12-step meetings?
- I'm doing this my own way.

23:11.522 --> 23:15.390
How? Sittin' at home in front of your TV
with your fingers diggin' into your sofa?

23:15.459 --> 23:17.757
There's a difference
between dry and sober.

23:17.828 --> 23:21.127
Hey, look. Look! I just want
to be able to do my job, huh?

23:21.198 --> 23:23.758
I don't want to have to transfer
to another precinct.

23:23.834 --> 23:25.768
I don't do good
in new situations.

23:25.836 --> 23:28.134
- I've raised that kid.
- Raised who?

23:28.205 --> 23:32.141
Kelly.

23:32.209 --> 23:34.700
You like this, huh?

23:34.778 --> 23:37.975
Seein' people
embarrass themselves?

23:38.048 --> 23:41.245
You're not
embarrassing yourself.

23:41.318 --> 23:43.343
Not now.

23:46.990 --> 23:50.187
I got some thinkin' to do.
I'll see you in the morning.

24:14.418 --> 24:17.148
- Hey, how's the arm?
- It's a little stiff.

24:17.221 --> 24:19.348
Hey, uh, Narcotics
over in the 12...

24:19.423 --> 24:22.449
just picked up those DiLeo brothers
on a junkie sweep, Detective.

24:22.526 --> 24:25.393
- Are they charged?
- They hadn't copped yet when they got picked up,

24:25.462 --> 24:28.431
but one of them had a VCR and
said his mother gave it to him.

24:28.499 --> 24:30.967
She backed his story
when Narcotics called her up.

24:31.034 --> 24:33.264
What was Narcotics
speaking to the mother for?

24:33.337 --> 24:35.567
They didn't know we wanted
these guys for our case.

24:35.639 --> 24:38.005
- Which one had the VCR?
- Uh, Michael, the one in the pen.

24:38.075 --> 24:40.509
- I'll talk to him first.
- Want me to do the interview?

24:40.577 --> 24:42.511
- No, I'll do it.
- Sure. No problem.

24:42.579 --> 24:44.547
- I'll talk to him in a minute.
- Okay.

24:47.718 --> 24:50.152
How'd it go last night?

24:50.220 --> 24:52.711
I don't know.

24:52.789 --> 24:56.782
Lieutenant said he'd inform me
this morning what he decided.

25:00.898 --> 25:05.562
Sipowicz will work with you
on the Ceizler investigation.

25:05.636 --> 25:08.764
- Great.
- That's, uh, outdoors, indoors?

25:08.839 --> 25:11.273
Outdoors, indoors, full duty.

25:14.244 --> 25:16.178
Thanks, Lieutenant.

25:23.654 --> 25:26.885
So you understand your rights
as I've given them to you?

25:26.957 --> 25:30.518
- Yeah.
- And you're sure you don't want an attorney?

25:30.594 --> 25:33.154
- I don't need one. I didn't do nothin'.
- Okay.

25:33.230 --> 25:36.165
If you change your mind,
you let me know.

25:43.540 --> 25:45.667
You're a hell of an acrobat.

25:45.742 --> 25:48.438
Yeah, you guys
scared us yesterday.

25:48.512 --> 25:51.481
We wanted to talk to you about what
happened to your next-door neighbor.

25:51.548 --> 25:53.846
Yeah, we didn't know
what you guys wanted.

25:53.917 --> 25:57.148
Yeah. Did you hear what happened
to her... Mrs. Ceizler?

25:57.221 --> 25:59.849
Yeah, on the news,
and my mother said.

25:59.923 --> 26:04.451
Yeah, well, she got robbed,
strangled, and her throat was cut.

26:04.528 --> 26:07.622
We didn't have
nothin'to do with it.

26:07.698 --> 26:10.758
I mean, I barely knew her. You know,
I just knew her to say hello to.

26:12.169 --> 26:14.535
What are you doin' for a living?

26:14.605 --> 26:18.097
Odd jobs. You know, mechanical
repair, that kind of thing.

26:18.175 --> 26:21.576
I noticed the narcotics
collars on your sheet.

26:21.645 --> 26:24.170
Are you using now?

26:24.248 --> 26:27.411
Well, I'm not a hundred percent,

26:27.484 --> 26:29.918
but, you know,
I'm not as bad as I was.

26:29.987 --> 26:33.047
Yeah. You move back in
with your mom to get straight?

26:33.123 --> 26:35.057
That's part of it.

26:35.125 --> 26:38.617
Mm-hmm.
That must be tough.

26:38.695 --> 26:41.425
You're trying to get straight,
and your brother's still usin'.

26:41.498 --> 26:44.228
That's hard.

26:44.301 --> 26:47.429
He ever agitate you
into gettin' high?

26:47.504 --> 26:49.699
You'd have to talk to him.

26:51.541 --> 26:55.773
Yeah. I'll tell you,
Michael, I don't know.

26:55.846 --> 26:59.680
If you were involved,
I can't see you with the break-in.

26:59.750 --> 27:04.483
Not livin'next door.
Maybe it was your brother.

27:04.554 --> 27:06.886
I mean, I know
you two were home.

27:06.957 --> 27:10.085
You dropped your mother
off at work.

27:10.160 --> 27:14.028
Maybe he was lookin' for a place
to break in, get some money, get high.

27:14.097 --> 27:17.191
Look, I wasn't in that lady's house
yesterday, and neither was my brother.

27:17.267 --> 27:22.204
You see, when something like this happens,
it's usually a burglary gone out of whack.

27:22.272 --> 27:26.504
Nobody's meant to get hurt.
It just gets out of control.

27:30.280 --> 27:33.215
That's not what happened.
I had nothin' to do with this.

27:33.283 --> 27:37.219
How about the VCR?
Jamie steal it from your mother?

27:37.287 --> 27:40.279
She gave that to us.

27:40.357 --> 27:45.056
No. No.

27:45.128 --> 27:49.792
He took it from your mother,
but you wouldn't let him sell it.

27:56.073 --> 27:59.236
I mean, they just...
they just put me on this, you know.

27:59.309 --> 28:01.539
It's a straight-up burglary,
it looks to me.

28:01.611 --> 28:04.307
And that woman must've walked in,
all hell broke loose.

28:04.381 --> 28:06.508
Things happened
no one meant to happen.

28:06.583 --> 28:09.347
Look, I don't know
what you're talkin' about.

28:09.419 --> 28:11.979
That's why you dove out that window
yesterday when the cops came?

28:12.055 --> 28:14.250
Is that a crime?
No, I didn't think so.

28:14.324 --> 28:16.918
I'm just sayin'
that's what you did, Jamie.

28:16.993 --> 28:20.485
Now, in the detective's handbook,
we call that "suspicious behavior."

28:20.564 --> 28:23.158
Look, are you gonna
charge me with anything?

28:25.001 --> 28:27.060
What's your hurry, Jamie?

28:27.137 --> 28:30.265
Hey, you're not Jonesing
on me now, are you?

28:30.340 --> 28:32.900
- How long since you fixed?
- Are you gonna charge me or release me?

28:32.976 --> 28:35.911
I may smack you in your face,
you little turd...

28:35.979 --> 28:39.039
Up yours, dick-head, all right?
I wanna be charged or released.

28:39.116 --> 28:42.552
What are these, new sneakers? Huh?
What happened to your other ones?

28:42.619 --> 28:44.951
They got covered with blood?

28:45.021 --> 28:47.819
Watch it.
Watch your balance.

29:01.171 --> 29:04.231
Detective Kelly again,
Mrs. DiLeo.

29:04.307 --> 29:08.266
That's Detective Sipowicz.

29:08.345 --> 29:10.279
Ma'am.

29:10.347 --> 29:12.577
We need to talk
about Jamie and Michael again.

29:12.649 --> 29:15.482
- Why?
- Could we come in?

29:15.552 --> 29:18.282
No. They haven't done anything.

29:18.355 --> 29:21.654
Mrs. DiLeo, yesterday you told me they
never had trouble with the police before.

29:21.725 --> 29:26.287
I said, not for several years!
You should let 'em start over.

29:26.363 --> 29:28.729
They were picked up
tryin' to buy heroin,

29:28.799 --> 29:31.734
and they were tryin' to get it
by sellin' your VCR.

29:31.802 --> 29:35.135
Well, that's-that's mine. It's got
nothin' to do with Lois Ceizler.

29:35.205 --> 29:38.834
So you're sayin' that you gave them
your VCR to buy heroin?

29:38.909 --> 29:41.002
I want you to leave me alone!

29:41.077 --> 29:44.274
Mrs. DiLeo,
it gets to the point...

29:44.347 --> 29:46.611
where a mother's love
isn't enough.

29:46.683 --> 29:48.742
It isn't what children need.

29:48.819 --> 29:51.379
Look, look, your sons
robbed you, didn't they?

29:51.455 --> 29:55.289
They took that VCR while you were at work,
and they did the same thing next door.

29:55.358 --> 29:59.226
They broke in, that woman was home,
and they did somethin' terrible to her.

29:59.296 --> 30:02.094
No, no, I gave it to 'em.
I don't know nothin' about next door.

30:02.165 --> 30:05.532
No, you know that woman was robbed
and strangled and her throat was cut.

30:05.602 --> 30:08.196
How long did she live
next door to you?

30:08.271 --> 30:10.262
Twenty-three years.

30:10.340 --> 30:14.538
We both lost our husbands
within two years of each other.

30:14.611 --> 30:17.705
Yeah, well, you know she didn't
deserve what happened to her.

30:17.781 --> 30:21.842
- I know.
- We want you to tell the truth about this VCR, Mrs. DiLeo.

30:21.918 --> 30:25.718
We want to keep your boys in custody
while we investigate this other matter.

30:25.789 --> 30:29.725
All that can happen is they get clean,
they get off the dope's influence...

30:29.793 --> 30:31.727
and they can't hurt anybody else.

30:31.795 --> 30:34.025
Nobody wants to charge them
for next door right now.

30:34.097 --> 30:37.464
- Maybe we'll find out they weren't involved.
- I'm so confused.

30:37.534 --> 30:41.971
I'm-I'm askin' you,
please, just leave me alone!

30:42.038 --> 30:44.973
- You believe in God, don't you, Mrs. DiLeo?
- Yes!

30:45.041 --> 30:48.169
Then pray to God.
Ask him what he wants you to do.

30:48.245 --> 30:52.944
Oh, please, please,
just give me time.

30:53.016 --> 30:55.678
Do you still have my card?

30:55.752 --> 30:57.743
Yes. It's inside.

31:01.024 --> 31:05.256
I'll pray.
I'll ask God what to do.

31:31.555 --> 31:33.716
What do you think, Mr. Kelly?

31:33.790 --> 31:36.725
I think the people running
this charity should be happy.

31:36.793 --> 31:39.660
We're going to raise over
a half-million dollars tonight.

31:39.729 --> 31:43.358
It's how the idle rich persuade
themselves they're leading useful lives.

31:45.335 --> 31:48.327
My husband just got here,
Mr. Kelly.

31:48.405 --> 31:50.839
See, there's Tom,
and that's Greg Sacca,

31:50.907 --> 31:54.741
one of his unprincipled assistants
who's bearding for him this evening.

31:54.811 --> 31:58.941
The blonde on Mr. Sacca's arm
is my husband's new mistress.

32:00.984 --> 32:04.511
I think I'm going to pretend
to go and powder my nose. Excuse me.

32:04.588 --> 32:07.580
I'm gonna...
I'll walk you to the door.

32:09.225 --> 32:12.820
Excuse me. Hi, Johnny.

32:12.896 --> 32:15.262
- Hey.
- Hi.

32:15.332 --> 32:17.391
Big doings, huh?

32:17.467 --> 32:21.631
Hmm. My firm took a table. Was that
Susan Wagner, Thomas Wagner's wife?

32:21.705 --> 32:23.900
Yeah, I'm,
I'm doing security for 'em.

32:23.974 --> 32:26.101
Oh.

32:26.176 --> 32:28.667
- You look great.
- Thanks.

32:28.745 --> 32:31.236
- You look very dashing yourself.
- Yeah, well...

32:33.016 --> 32:36.281
- How's the new job?
- It's interesting.

32:36.353 --> 32:40.756
- Yeah. I'm gonna take off. I'll talk to you later.
- See you, Johnny.

32:40.824 --> 32:43.588
- Shall we take a little detour, Mr. Kelly?
- Yeah, sure.

32:43.660 --> 32:45.287
I miss you.

32:47.063 --> 32:50.931
- Hello.
- I was just coming to find you. Lovely gown.

32:51.001 --> 32:53.663
Aren't you sweet.
You remember Mr. Kelly.

32:53.737 --> 32:55.500
- Hi.
- Of course.

32:55.572 --> 32:57.767
- Good evening, Greg.
- Mrs. Wagner.

32:57.841 --> 33:00.605
Looks like a great event.
Do you know Greta Weisner?

33:00.677 --> 33:03.669
How do you do, Greta?
I'm Susan, Tom's wife.

33:03.747 --> 33:07.547
- How do you do?
- Well, Tom, you seem to be enjoying...

33:07.617 --> 33:10.780
the company of Greg and Greta so much, why
don't we have them join us at our table?

33:10.854 --> 33:13.652
Let's just leave the seating
the way it is.

33:13.723 --> 33:16.487
Perhaps we'll get to know
each other another time.

33:16.559 --> 33:20.359
- And I do hope this doesn't make for any awkwardness.
- What do you mean?

33:20.430 --> 33:23.661
Conscience pangs while you're
screwing him, that sort of thing.

33:23.733 --> 33:26.327
- Susan...
- Maybe you're not afflicted in that way.

33:26.403 --> 33:28.735
- God knows my husband isn't.
- That's enough.

33:28.805 --> 33:31.865
I think you're right.
I think, actually,

33:31.941 --> 33:36.810
uh, I will call it a night,
if you'll let go of my arm.

33:40.183 --> 33:42.117
Mr. Kelly?

33:58.535 --> 34:02.562
Does that make your list
of most miserable evenings, Mr. Kelly?

34:02.639 --> 34:05.767
Well, at least
it wasn't rainin', right?

34:05.842 --> 34:11.280
I seem to have become someone who finds
satisfaction in public embarrassments...

34:11.347 --> 34:14.214
and who confides her personal
problems to strangers.

34:14.284 --> 34:17.117
I hear people's
personal problems all the time.

34:17.187 --> 34:20.554
I expect you do.
I hope you're not going to quit.

34:20.623 --> 34:24.581
No. No, you're safe, right?
We got through the shift.

34:28.931 --> 34:32.594
I'm gonna, uh...
I'm gonna get goin'.

34:32.668 --> 34:35.331
Thank you
for taking care of me.

34:35.405 --> 34:37.565
- Night.
- Good night.

35:13.042 --> 35:14.976
Mrs. DiLeo?

35:21.050 --> 35:23.592
You want to talk to me?

35:25.494 --> 35:27.428
Hey.

35:34.870 --> 35:38.636
I'm gonna louse up
your day real good, Jamie.

35:44.046 --> 35:49.848
Your mother gave you up.

35:51.387 --> 35:54.015
I didn't do
none of the violence.

35:54.089 --> 35:58.685
Alls I was was the lookout. Jamie been wantin'
to take that house out for like four months.

35:58.761 --> 36:01.059
Your brother Jamie?

36:01.130 --> 36:03.655
So I'm standin'
outside in the back,

36:03.732 --> 36:06.826
and he goes in
through the basement...

36:06.902 --> 36:10.963
and then I started to hear
scuffling and so forth.

36:12.942 --> 36:15.274
You see, we didn't expect
that woman to be home.

36:15.344 --> 36:18.575
- You go inside?
- I went in.

36:20.182 --> 36:22.742
And this woman was resisting.

36:24.119 --> 36:27.054
And Jamie's got his hands
on her throat...

36:27.122 --> 36:30.387
and he squeezed her throat
until she went out.

36:30.459 --> 36:34.020
She was out, and Jamie went
upstairs to get the jewelry.

36:34.096 --> 36:36.326
What'd you do?

36:36.398 --> 36:39.663
I went back outside.

36:39.735 --> 36:42.033
So...

36:42.104 --> 36:46.370
But then in a couple of minutes,
I started to hear more scuffling.

36:46.442 --> 36:49.570
So I went back in...

36:49.645 --> 36:52.773
and... she must've got up...

36:52.848 --> 36:56.147
because she was upstairs
where Jamie was.

36:56.218 --> 36:58.243
He got this lamp cord...

36:58.320 --> 37:01.551
and wrapped it around her neck.

37:01.624 --> 37:03.888
Finally she went down.

37:03.959 --> 37:06.792
When did her throat get cut?

37:06.862 --> 37:09.956
Well, first he went
to the drawers to get the jewelry.

37:10.032 --> 37:14.969
And then when he was goin' out,
he got this ring off her finger,

37:15.037 --> 37:17.733
and that's when
he cut her throat.

37:25.314 --> 37:27.282
Then what happened?

37:29.952 --> 37:33.444
Then we sold Peggy the jewelry,
and then we copped.

37:36.992 --> 37:40.291
How much smack did you get
for the jewelry?

37:40.362 --> 37:43.195
Three dime bags.

37:43.265 --> 37:46.598
That was cool.
That was enough, you know?

37:46.669 --> 37:49.365
We could both get off.

37:53.008 --> 37:56.967
And I wouldn't
let Jamie sell that VCR...

38:01.383 --> 38:04.181
because that...

38:04.253 --> 38:06.414
that belonged to my mother.

38:21.303 --> 38:25.899
- I'll do what I can,
but I can't promise anything.

38:25.975 --> 38:28.637
Is he done?

38:28.711 --> 38:31.612
Yeah, he just signed a statement.
I'm gonna call the D.A.

38:31.680 --> 38:34.843
- You did a good job.
- Andy moved the mother.

38:34.917 --> 38:36.851
Good.

38:36.919 --> 38:40.252
Nice goin', partner.
Like ridin' a bike, huh?

38:40.322 --> 38:43.189
Yeah. Hey, Lieutenant.

38:43.258 --> 38:47.194
I don't know if you heard me
yesterday sayin' I was grateful.

38:47.262 --> 38:51.164
You met me halfway on this...
uh, more than halfway.

38:51.233 --> 38:54.225
Does this mean
we're goin' out for ribs?

38:54.303 --> 38:57.204
No, I didn't mean anything
personal with that.

38:57.272 --> 38:59.433
Just do a good job, Andy.

39:04.847 --> 39:07.509
Hey, Detective.
The, uh, one brother rolled, huh?

39:07.583 --> 39:10.609
Yeah. Yeah.
You goin' back to Anticrime?

39:10.686 --> 39:12.620
That's what
they told me, yeah.

39:12.688 --> 39:15.589
Hey, I enjoyed
workin' with ya.

39:15.657 --> 39:17.955
Same here, Detective.
I felt like I learned a lot.

39:18.027 --> 39:20.757
- I'll see you around.
- Flying James.

39:23.399 --> 39:27.665
Hey, I just wanted to let you know,
uh, I'm gettin' my gun back.

39:27.736 --> 39:31.467
Evidently, the Permit Board didn't share
your reservations about my reliability.

39:31.540 --> 39:34.031
Well, that's why they make
vanilla and chocolate, 4B.

39:34.109 --> 39:37.340
You know, possibly there was some
merit in what you said the other day.

39:37.413 --> 39:41.873
Possibly, uh, you know, gettin' robbed
and beaten up has upset me.

39:41.950 --> 39:43.884
In fact, I'd say it has.

39:43.952 --> 39:47.388
But I'm still a human being
who needs to function in this city.

39:47.456 --> 39:51.051
You want to do somethin' smart? Take your
gun over to the property room in Queens.

39:51.126 --> 39:53.788
- No. No.
- No, you know what? Wait. Give it to me.

39:53.862 --> 39:57.491
Give it to me. I'll hold onto it
till you sort stuff out.

39:59.368 --> 40:02.963
No, uh, but thanks
for your concern.

40:03.038 --> 40:05.802
You know, I still
consider myself your friend.

40:05.874 --> 40:08.604
- I hope you feel likewise.
- I do.

40:08.677 --> 40:13.410
Because, uh, I haven't made
that many friends in New York.

40:21.323 --> 40:25.259
I'm a respectable person.
I'm a chef at the Seville Hotel.

40:25.327 --> 40:27.693
Respectable people get caught
with whores all the time.

40:27.763 --> 40:31.199
I'm a married man. I got kids.
I don't want this to come out.

40:31.266 --> 40:33.928
You should've thought of that
before you unzipped your fly.

40:34.002 --> 40:37.870
- Hey, Sarge, what do we got?
- Solicitation. He was tryin' to pick up a whore.

40:37.940 --> 40:42.138
Hmm. Listen, let me talk to this man
for a second, will you, Detective?

40:42.211 --> 40:46.079
- Hold off on writin' that up just two seconds, all right?
- Sure.

40:46.148 --> 40:48.708
- Come here. What's your name?
- Frank Kennedy.

40:48.784 --> 40:50.877
Yeah, Frank,
just step here a second.

40:50.953 --> 40:53.615
I can't believe I let something
like this happen to me.

40:53.689 --> 40:57.716
Well, sometimes we follow our little
captains into battle there, don't we?

40:57.793 --> 41:01.058
Now, uh, do I understand that
you're a chef at the Hotel Seville?

41:01.130 --> 41:03.496
- Yeah, for the past 12 years.
- So in other words,

41:03.565 --> 41:06.557
you would be involved in preparing
room service meals, for example?

41:06.635 --> 41:08.728
Yeah, that's what I do.

41:08.804 --> 41:13.639
Someone we recently arrested
has been stayin' at the Seville.

41:13.709 --> 41:16.735
- Oh, the secret government witness guy?
- That's correct.

41:16.812 --> 41:19.679
- Mr. Lasagna, we call him.
- Mr. Lasagna, eh?

41:19.748 --> 41:22.808
- Well, that's all he ever orders.
- And you prepare the meal?

41:22.885 --> 41:26.150
Yeah. I'm in a lot
of trouble here.

41:26.221 --> 41:28.018
Not necessarily.

41:30.192 --> 41:32.660
Hey, Luth, good dog.
Hey, Andy.

41:32.728 --> 41:36.289
Uh, Medavoy, you want me
to take Luther there for a stroll?

41:36.365 --> 41:38.560
Yeah, geez, Andy,
that'd be great.

41:38.634 --> 41:41.330
I got a bunch of phone calls
to make on a robbery.

41:41.403 --> 41:44.201
Yeah, uh, give me
his scooper there.

41:44.273 --> 41:46.332
- Yeah. Here you go.
- Yeah.

41:46.408 --> 41:48.740
- Thanks.
- Hey, no problem.

41:48.810 --> 41:51.938
All right, Luther,
wanna lay a loaf?

41:57.653 --> 41:59.780
Right this way, sir.

42:04.526 --> 42:06.687
Thanks.

42:06.762 --> 42:10.357
Thank you for coming, Mr. Kelly.
I know we weren't scheduled.

42:10.432 --> 42:14.459
- That's okay.
- I have absolutely no need for your services.

42:14.536 --> 42:17.505
I don't have any excuse
for asking you to come over.

42:17.573 --> 42:20.770
I wanted someone to keep me company,
and you came to mind.

42:20.842 --> 42:23.367
How'd you get the eye?

42:23.445 --> 42:26.243
My husband beat me up after
the festivities last night.

42:26.315 --> 42:29.580
I'm sure it made for better
sex afterward with Greta.

42:29.651 --> 42:33.644
This is a horrible way to live.

42:33.722 --> 42:36.486
This is not
how I wanted my life to be.

42:36.558 --> 42:39.618
What about making some changes?

42:39.695 --> 42:42.994
Uh-huh. I should. I should, uh...

42:43.065 --> 42:45.590
I should divorce him.

42:45.667 --> 42:48.761
My husband doesn't want that.

42:48.837 --> 42:53.103
I think he's actually found exactly
the arrangement he's been looking for.

42:53.175 --> 42:56.941
He has a mistress and the bimbos
he cheats on her with.

42:57.012 --> 43:00.106
And then every so often
he gets to beat up...

43:00.182 --> 43:04.016
his wellborn and genteelly
impoverished wife.

43:04.086 --> 43:07.647
He says that he's
insulated the assets.

43:07.723 --> 43:09.987
He says that, uh,
if I file for divorce,

43:10.058 --> 43:12.356
he'll tie up the process
for five years...

43:12.427 --> 43:15.419
and meanwhile
I'll be penniless.

43:15.497 --> 43:18.398
And, uh...

43:18.467 --> 43:21.834
I, I just feel...

43:21.903 --> 43:26.067
I feel... so helpless.

43:26.141 --> 43:29.235
And I feel trapped...

43:31.980 --> 43:34.778
and ashamed and afraid,
and I wish he were dead.

43:37.953 --> 43:42.117
Am I under arrest?

43:45.160 --> 43:47.993
Wishes don't get you busted,
Mrs. Wagner.

43:48.063 --> 43:50.793
It's more than a wish,
Mr. Kelly.

43:50.866 --> 43:54.802
If there was some way that I could come
home one night and he'd been shot...

43:54.870 --> 43:57.498
Well, we're gettin' into
a bad area now, Mrs. Wagner.

44:00.375 --> 44:02.969
Saved by the bell.

44:06.281 --> 44:10.081
- You got a phone I can use?
- Mmm.

44:22.064 --> 44:23.998
Oh, look at this.
Unbelievable.

44:24.066 --> 44:27.229
- Relax. Relax.
- Maybe English isn't your first language, Sipowicz.

44:27.302 --> 44:31.068
- Is that the problem?
- This is my farewell visit. I just want to apologize.

44:31.139 --> 44:34.302
- I mean, you got a job to do.
- You know, you put us right in the middle.

44:34.376 --> 44:37.038
Well, I had a bee
in my bonnet about this guy,

44:37.112 --> 44:39.876
and I wasn't lookin' at things
from your point of view.

44:39.948 --> 44:42.542
Who's that out there?
Is that who I think it is?

44:42.617 --> 44:45.643
- Don't worry about it. The situation's under control.
- Hey, hey, there he is.

44:45.721 --> 44:49.179
I'll tell you somethin', Sipowicz.
I'm gonna miss you down there in D.C.

44:49.257 --> 44:51.657
Back at you, Alfonse.
That's why I came to say good-bye.

44:51.727 --> 44:54.321
You know, you're like
that geyser... Old Reliable.

44:54.396 --> 44:57.331
Who am I gonna count on to make
an asshole out of himself?

44:57.399 --> 45:00.425
Your food's coming,
Giardella. Why don't you go back inside?

45:00.502 --> 45:03.027
You see, they're
deliverin'my expensive dinner now.

45:03.105 --> 45:05.403
What are you eatin' tonight?
Big Mac and fries?

45:05.474 --> 45:07.999
- I'm a realist, Alfonse.
- Bring it in.

45:08.076 --> 45:11.068
Whatever I'm gonna eat tonight I know
won't compare to what's under that tray.

45:11.146 --> 45:14.775
- What's the special of the day? Beef de Merde?
- Who knows?

45:14.850 --> 45:17.785
I'm havin' some nice lasagna.
If you'll excuse me now.

45:17.853 --> 45:20.378
Yeah. Go on. Bon appetit.

45:22.023 --> 45:25.288
Uh, you know what? I don't...
I don't need to stick around.

45:25.360 --> 45:28.022
Just convey my sentiments
to the relief guy, huh?

45:28.096 --> 45:30.428
Just tell him what I expressed.

45:30.499 --> 45:34.560
My God! This is crap!

45:34.636 --> 45:37.571
Sipowicz!
He poisoned me!

45:37.639 --> 45:41.075
Call 9-1-1!
The rat bastard poisoned me!

46:09.204 --> 46:11.263
He's dead.

46:11.339 --> 46:13.307
Your father?

46:13.375 --> 46:16.105
"Cleaning his gun."

46:29.991 --> 46:34.087
He left me this... letter
in my apartment.

46:38.733 --> 46:41.899
"I don't want you to feel bad.

46:42.033 --> 46:45.799
"There's reasons
this makes sense.

46:45.870 --> 46:48.270
"This way Mommy gets benefits,

46:48.339 --> 46:50.807
"which I don't feel
it's right she'd lose.

46:50.875 --> 46:53.400
"'Cause whatever else,
that was still me...

46:53.478 --> 46:57.380
"going through those doors
22 years.

46:57.448 --> 47:00.315
"The one thing
I can rest easy with:

47:01.886 --> 47:04.980
"You're a good person...

47:05.056 --> 47:07.718
"and you're on your way...

47:07.792 --> 47:10.761
and you weren't touched
by any of this."

47:15.266 --> 47:17.496
Oh, God.

47:17.568 --> 47:21.231
He used to hold me in his arms...

47:23.941 --> 47:26.739
and I'd feel...

47:26.811 --> 47:30.269
that nothing could go wrong
in the whole world.

47:41.359 --> 47:43.293
