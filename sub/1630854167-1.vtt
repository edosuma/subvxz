[whimsical music playing]

00:43.617 --> 00:46.100
[humming]

01:03.357 --> 01:05.359
I thought I'd slip into
something a little sexier.

01:06.079 --> 01:07.381
Mm.

01:07.481 --> 01:09.102
Just what I always wanted,

01:09.202 --> 01:11.344
magician on top,
Donald Duck on bottom.

01:11.444 --> 01:13.446
[chuckles]

01:14.808 --> 01:17.931
Who is more excited,
the magician or Donald Duck?

01:20.173 --> 01:22.175
Clearly the duck.

01:22.495 --> 01:24.497
[giggles]

01:25.178 --> 01:26.119
[gunshot]

01:26.219 --> 01:27.680
Oh, Jesus.

01:27.780 --> 01:29.782
Mother!

01:30.303 --> 01:32.485
-Hello there, Millicent.
-Morning.

01:32.585 --> 01:34.006
The gun, Mother.

01:34.106 --> 01:36.008
Oh, for heaven's sakes,
Bellwether.

01:36.108 --> 01:37.610
I didn't shoot Moseley.

01:37.710 --> 01:39.812
I just scared him
back into the gator pit.

01:39.912 --> 01:41.694
William Moseley is my pet.

01:41.794 --> 01:43.335
Named after
the first governor of Florida.

01:43.435 --> 01:44.737
Yes, we all know that.

01:44.837 --> 01:46.418
You wouldn't shoot at
someone's poodle, would you?

01:46.518 --> 01:48.540
I would,
if it were on my property.

01:48.640 --> 01:49.822
How'd he get out?

01:49.922 --> 01:52.184
I don't know.
Some kind of hole in the fence.

01:52.284 --> 01:54.286
[doorbell buzzing]

01:55.727 --> 01:57.729
[quirky music playing]

02:22.874 --> 02:24.976
You can't just leave 'em
on the wrong side of the gate.

02:25.076 --> 02:26.097
I'm kind of in a hurry, okay?

02:26.197 --> 02:27.738
They're, like, eight inches
from your property.

02:27.838 --> 02:30.021
These are practically
brand-new seersucker slacks.

02:30.121 --> 02:32.123
I don't wanna muddy them.

02:53.143 --> 02:55.145
-Thank you.
-My auntie says
I'm enabling you.

02:57.587 --> 03:00.490
If I was a real friend,
I'd cut it the hell out.

03:00.590 --> 03:04.374
This the same auntie
that lost 10 grand
on pachinko last year?

03:04.474 --> 03:06.476
That's a low blow, man.
Come on.

03:07.397 --> 03:09.399
Something is amiss
with the azaleas.

03:10.079 --> 03:11.661
[scoffs]

03:11.761 --> 03:13.583
You're an odd duck, Bell.

03:13.683 --> 03:15.785
It's why I love you.
Catch ya later.

[dramatic music playing]

03:31.100 --> 03:33.102
[siren wailing]

03:37.706 --> 03:40.008
Got an idea of how fast
you were going?

03:40.108 --> 03:42.391
Make it a good guess,
because I got a radar gun.

03:43.712 --> 03:45.213
North of 80?

03:45.313 --> 03:47.255
Ding, ding, ding.
We got a winner.

03:47.355 --> 03:49.357
Jonathon Michael Dungee.

03:49.918 --> 03:51.339
Now you know mine.

03:51.439 --> 03:53.461
You gonna tell me yours?

03:53.561 --> 03:56.504
Do you want my name
so you can lodge a report?

03:56.604 --> 03:58.947
'Cause maybe we're doing
a little highway flirting?

03:59.047 --> 03:59.908
[cell phone rings]

04:00.008 --> 04:02.310
Yeah, 911. What do you want?

04:02.410 --> 04:04.832
Is this is a real emergency,
or you got something
stuck up your butt?

04:04.932 --> 04:07.075
[chuckles]

04:07.175 --> 04:09.077
Oh, shit.

04:09.177 --> 04:11.178
[siren wailing]

04:16.944 --> 04:19.086
[Bell] Aren't you
gonna question me?

04:19.186 --> 04:20.688
-Did you do it?
-Well, no.

04:20.788 --> 04:21.929
Uh-huh. Don't care.

04:22.029 --> 04:24.051
-It's murder.
-Still don't care.

04:24.151 --> 04:25.573
'Cause I'm not
authorized to care.

04:25.673 --> 04:27.895
All I'm authorized to do
is write tickets.

04:27.995 --> 04:30.297
Felonies I report
to the county sheriff
in Crestview.

04:30.397 --> 04:33.140
The sheriff is an idiot,
a moron, a cretin.

04:33.240 --> 04:34.862
-He's just gone through
a bit of a shock.
-An imbecile.

04:34.962 --> 04:36.963
A birdbrain,
simpleton, dumbass.

04:38.165 --> 04:40.067
Last month, he investigated
Mel Doppler's murder

04:40.167 --> 04:41.588
and still hasn't solved it.

04:41.688 --> 04:44.391
It's ridiculous, because
clearly Bill Mason killed him.

04:44.491 --> 04:46.553
And you know that why?

04:46.653 --> 04:50.196
Doppler's remains were found
in the Apalachicola River
on June 14th.

04:50.296 --> 04:53.359
Phone records show Doppler
called Mason on June 4th,

04:53.459 --> 04:56.202
so the sheriff presumed he was
killed sometime after that.

04:56.302 --> 04:58.805
If you sample the remains,
you'll find diatomic activity,

04:58.905 --> 05:01.407
which does not occur
until 21 days postmortem.

05:01.507 --> 05:04.730
Ergo, Doppler was murdered
sometime in mid-May.

05:04.830 --> 05:06.012
What are you talking about?

05:06.112 --> 05:08.334
Bill Mason killed Mel Doppler,

05:08.434 --> 05:09.895
faked the phone call,
and is living the dream

05:09.995 --> 05:12.338
in Destin
as an off-brand Chippendale--

05:12.438 --> 05:14.340
-The Cockpits.
-[sighs]

05:14.440 --> 05:16.702
I guess the "pit" part of
the pun refers to the armpits.

05:16.802 --> 05:17.943
I don't know.
They could do better.

05:18.043 --> 05:22.107
Okay, so just out of curiosity,
'cause again, not my job,

05:22.207 --> 05:23.789
you have any proof of this,

05:23.889 --> 05:26.512
or you pull all this
out of your gold-plated ass?

05:26.612 --> 05:28.613
[through gritted teeth]
If you show her,
she'll never leave.

05:33.819 --> 05:35.000
Okay.

05:35.100 --> 05:37.102
[suspenseful music playing]

05:47.432 --> 05:49.434
What in the holy hell?

05:50.715 --> 05:52.717
My crime lab.

05:55.520 --> 05:57.381
Emillia McDunnough,

05:57.481 --> 05:59.744
nephew killed her
for a lottery ticket.

05:59.844 --> 06:02.747
PK Benton, decapitated
in his trailer park.

06:02.847 --> 06:04.588
Talk to the gentleman
in lot eight.

06:04.688 --> 06:08.272
Maxi Tran,
the manicurist did it.

06:08.372 --> 06:10.634
Why I'm the only one who
figured that out escapes me.

06:10.734 --> 06:12.356
Shall I go on?

06:12.456 --> 06:14.878
Why didn't you tell anyone?

06:14.978 --> 06:16.980
I am not authorized.

06:17.701 --> 06:19.403
[scoffs]

06:19.503 --> 06:22.886
Mr. Prescott,
I'd like to know exactly
how you did all of this

06:22.986 --> 06:26.810
when everybody in town
knows that you haven't been off
of your property in five years,

06:26.910 --> 06:28.912
ever since--

06:29.272 --> 06:31.274
Hey!

06:34.918 --> 06:39.022
The murder weapon
was a double-edged blade,

06:39.122 --> 06:42.025
likely an oyster knife,
based on hilt guard marks,

06:42.125 --> 06:43.506
wound edge bruising,
and blood loss.

06:43.606 --> 06:45.108
[Cammie] An oyster knife.

06:45.208 --> 06:48.671
And the victim had a toothache
in the days before his murder.

06:48.771 --> 06:51.234
-And you know that how?
-Because he knows everything.

06:51.334 --> 06:53.236
[Bell] Well, because
he looks like a Smurf.

06:53.336 --> 06:57.239
Likely the result
of excessive benzocaine
from an oral pain relief gel.

06:57.339 --> 07:01.443
Now, get this corpse
off my property
and to the coroner's.

07:01.543 --> 07:03.545
We don't have a coroner.

07:05.027 --> 07:07.029
You really have no idea what's
going on out there, do you?

07:08.230 --> 07:10.232
Boggsville.

07:10.993 --> 07:12.494
Six months ago,
the mayor told everyone

07:12.594 --> 07:14.596
that their paychecks
were gonna bounce.

07:15.237 --> 07:17.739
Cops left, garbage men quit,

07:17.839 --> 07:19.941
and, in case anyone
other than my kid gives a crap,

07:20.041 --> 07:21.663
the library closed.

07:21.763 --> 07:23.625
They only kept me because
the radar gun is the one thing

07:23.725 --> 07:25.807
standing between this town
and bankruptcy.

07:27.008 --> 07:28.950
It ain't glamorous
or satisfying

07:29.050 --> 07:31.873
or really anything other
than unmitigated hell,

07:31.973 --> 07:33.955
but I'm it.

07:34.055 --> 07:35.917
Last one standing.

07:36.017 --> 07:37.959
So I'm gonna ask you
one more time, Mr. Prescott.

07:38.059 --> 07:40.762
How is it that you know
about all of these murders

07:40.862 --> 07:42.483
when you haven't been
off of your property since--

07:42.583 --> 07:44.585
Stop.

07:46.027 --> 07:47.528
You haven't been off
of your property

07:47.628 --> 07:49.650
since your wife was murdered.

07:49.750 --> 07:51.752
[tense music playing]

08:01.401 --> 08:03.403
[theme music playing]

08:08.608 --> 08:11.872
Yeah, there's been a murder
at the old Prescott compound
two miles east of Boggsville.

08:11.972 --> 08:14.414
No ID. All we know
is that he's been stabbed,

08:15.575 --> 08:17.237
potentially by an oyster knife.

08:17.337 --> 08:23.403
Three years of writing tickets
does not qualify you
to opine on cause of death.

08:23.503 --> 08:26.666
You tell that son of a bitch
Bellwether Prescott
to expect me.

08:29.829 --> 08:31.831
Sheriff's on his way.

08:33.232 --> 08:36.616
So people around town
say that you're an agoraphobe,
which means...

08:36.716 --> 08:38.177
That's an anxiety disorder

08:38.277 --> 08:42.381
in which one fears places
or situations that cause panic.

08:42.481 --> 08:45.344
It's a fear of fear.
Not my issue.

08:45.444 --> 08:48.107
You know,
people telecommute to work.
I telecommute to life.

08:48.207 --> 08:50.029
My days could not be more full.

08:50.129 --> 08:52.431
I play chess
with an opponent in Norway.

08:52.531 --> 08:55.354
I'm learning to make tortellini
from an Italian nonna.

08:55.454 --> 08:57.456
The world is my oyster.

08:57.896 --> 08:59.117
[clears throat]

08:59.217 --> 09:00.719
Hey, hey, hey, what the hell?

09:00.819 --> 09:02.641
Do not contaminate
the crime scene!

09:02.741 --> 09:04.162
I have degrees in criminology

09:04.262 --> 09:05.964
from excellent
online institutions.

09:06.064 --> 09:08.366
Yeah? And I learned
how to floss on YouTube.

09:08.466 --> 09:10.448
Step away.

09:10.548 --> 09:13.611
Bellwether is what they call
a polymath.

09:13.711 --> 09:17.055
-A polymath?
-Yes, like Leonardo da Vinci.

09:17.155 --> 09:21.419
Hmm. If you're so smart,
how come you haven't solved
your wife's murder?

09:21.519 --> 09:23.521
That was incredibly hurtful.

09:25.443 --> 09:27.445
[contemplative music playing]

09:29.046 --> 09:31.869
Oh, God, this is disgusting.

09:31.969 --> 09:34.432
Okay, Addams Family,

09:34.532 --> 09:36.854
as far as I'm concerned,
you both are suspects.

09:38.736 --> 09:41.839
As far as I'm concerned,
you're trespassing.

09:41.939 --> 09:43.160
[Bell sighs]

09:43.260 --> 09:46.403
Six generations of Prescotts
have lived on this land.

09:46.503 --> 09:48.485
We have dredged. We have drunk.

09:48.585 --> 09:51.048
Some have even fathered
the occasional bastard child.

09:51.148 --> 09:54.011
But we have never,
ever committed murder.

09:54.111 --> 09:56.113
Mm, uh...

09:56.713 --> 09:58.054
What would
really be helpful, Mum,

09:58.154 --> 10:00.156
is if you would fetch me
some Ziplocs.

10:06.883 --> 10:08.885
Hey, I could arrest you.

10:09.525 --> 10:11.527
[Bell] Darby!

10:12.288 --> 10:14.290
Come on in.

10:15.411 --> 10:18.394
Oh, look,
it's the speed trap queen.

10:18.494 --> 10:21.277
It's my job. You were speeding.

10:21.377 --> 10:23.399
A girl's gotta make a living.
I get it.

10:23.499 --> 10:25.921
I must've done, like,
a thousand lap dances
back in the day.

10:26.021 --> 10:27.643
And you did them beautifully.

10:27.743 --> 10:29.525
Even in high school,
we knew you had
that special touch.

10:29.625 --> 10:31.127
-Aww.
-Gross.

10:31.227 --> 10:33.489
Now, your mama called
and said there's a hole
in the gator fence.

10:33.589 --> 10:35.811
The alligator situation
is under control,

10:35.911 --> 10:39.535
but I would love your help
with the murder victim.

10:39.635 --> 10:41.637
That is one blue
son of a bitch.

10:44.119 --> 10:47.923
Hmm, definitely bluebottles.
Probably on their second molt.

10:49.044 --> 10:51.026
[Bell] There you go.

10:51.126 --> 10:53.949
Time of death is...

10:54.049 --> 10:56.771
three days ago,
likely Monday night.

10:57.572 --> 10:59.574
Bygones be bygones?

11:01.015 --> 11:03.017
[squelching]

[exclaims in disgust]

11:12.026 --> 11:13.488
Organic in nature,

11:13.588 --> 11:15.890
which you'd care about
if you were a real cop.

11:15.990 --> 11:17.852
Well, if Florida
were a real place,

11:17.952 --> 11:19.854
maybe I'd be a real cop.

11:19.954 --> 11:21.495
Let me guess.
You're not from here?

11:21.595 --> 11:24.058
Detroit.
And none of your business.

11:24.158 --> 11:26.160
[cell phone ringing]

11:27.841 --> 11:29.843
Lorde.

11:30.404 --> 11:32.406
Uh-huh.

11:35.569 --> 11:37.271
On my way.

11:37.371 --> 11:38.872
Emergency. I have to go.

11:38.972 --> 11:40.193
Do not go near the crime scene.

11:40.293 --> 11:42.295
Final warning!

11:45.178 --> 11:47.220
[jazzy music playing]

11:51.905 --> 11:53.907
Five years, Bell.

11:55.068 --> 11:57.070
Maybe it's really time
to move on.

11:58.231 --> 12:00.233
I miss my son,

12:01.194 --> 12:04.497
the one who was
off to New Zealand or India

12:04.597 --> 12:06.499
or God knows where.

12:06.599 --> 12:09.021
If you don't mind,
I'd like to concentrate on
getting rid of this dead body

12:09.121 --> 12:11.023
before the whole place
starts to stink.

12:11.123 --> 12:13.586
Ugh, Jamie Dykstra
smelled like a swamp rat

12:13.686 --> 12:14.827
from the day he was born.

12:14.927 --> 12:16.509
Can't possibly get any worse.

12:16.609 --> 12:18.991
-Jamie Dykstra?
-Mm.

12:19.091 --> 12:21.634
Why didn't you
tell the officer who he was?

12:21.734 --> 12:24.036
I don't know.
I thought maybe you killed him.

12:24.136 --> 12:26.138
[quirky music playing]

I told him I'd wait,

Monday night, Kelsey?

24:41.049 --> 24:43.272
You were with your sister.

There's not many of us

25:07.395 --> 25:09.057
Yeah.
Not a lot of people know this,

25:09.157 --> 25:11.139

by Aristotle Onassis

25:11.239 --> 25:12.980
and didn't actually die
until 1987,

25:13.080 --> 25:15.383
and that's if
he's even dead at all, right?

25:15.483 --> 25:17.985
And it was Onassis' money
that financed 9/11,

25:18.085 --> 25:19.947

35:28.236 --> 35:29.538
I have the I-10.

35:29.638 --> 35:32.140
Sex without commitment
is vulgar.

35:32.240 --> 35:34.062
What century are you from?

35:34.162 --> 35:35.303
And not that you'd understand,

35:35.403 --> 35:36.704
but I need certain stuff
done to me

35:36.804 --> 35:38.266
and I need to do certain stuff
to other people

35:38.366 --> 35:39.387
and I'm not gonna
apologize for that.

35:39.487 --> 35:42.070
She's right, man.
Women have drives.

35:42.170 --> 35:43.951
-Slut-shaming's wrong.
-[Cammie] Mm-hmm.

35:44.051 --> 35:45.513
Learned that
from my ex-stepdaughter.

35:45.613 --> 35:46.954
-Can I have
my weed back, please?
-No.

35:47.054 --> 35:49.056
[clicks tongue]

35:50.017 --> 35:52.019
Okay, that's it.

35:52.860 --> 35:54.862
-[sighs]
-Wait, roll back.

35:57.184 --> 35:58.726
There!

35:58.826 --> 36:00.888
The Okahoochee van.

36:00.988 --> 36:03.390
Didn't Arvin say that he was
in Orlando Monday night?

36:05.592 --> 36:07.694
Appreciate that, I'll hold.

36:07.794 --> 36:10.137
Okahoochee said Arvin's
only worked there four months.

36:10.237 --> 36:12.139
They're checking his HR file.

36:12.239 --> 36:13.420
Do you ever wonder
if the people you meet

36:13.520 --> 36:15.022
on the interstate
have diseases?

36:15.122 --> 36:16.703
[sighs]

36:16.803 --> 36:18.805
SeaWorld?

36:19.406 --> 36:21.408
You sure about that?

36:21.808 --> 36:23.810
For three years, huh?

36:24.290 --> 36:26.372
Okay. Thanks.

36:27.293 --> 36:28.715
[scoffs]

36:28.815 --> 36:30.517
He lied.

36:30.617 --> 36:32.999
When I worked for The Post,
I did a story on SeaWorld.

36:33.099 --> 36:35.001
They vet everyone.

36:35.101 --> 36:37.123
No way a nutcase like Arvin
slipped through.

36:37.223 --> 36:38.845
You were a journalist?

36:38.945 --> 36:41.647
Until Marcus fired me
for getting pregnant,

36:41.747 --> 36:45.211
which is funny
because he's the one
who got me pregnant.

36:45.311 --> 36:48.254
That's my point,
casual sex is not nice.

36:48.354 --> 36:50.376
[sighs]

36:50.476 --> 36:52.478
Why did Arvin
lie about SeaWorld?

36:53.839 --> 36:58.263
Well, we know that Dykstra
spent the last five years
in Grayton.

36:58.363 --> 37:00.786
And that Arvin
was not at SeaWorld.

37:00.886 --> 37:02.888
-I should check Grayton.
-You should check Grayton.

37:04.129 --> 37:06.131
[suspenseful music playing]

37:10.295 --> 37:12.077
[Bell] I'm sorry your son
doesn't have a father.

37:12.177 --> 37:15.400
-Oh, my God, it's so slow.
-It's your VPN.

37:15.500 --> 37:17.502
Tyler has a father.
He just doesn't have a dad.

37:18.543 --> 37:21.606
Arvin Palanko,
convicted of manslaughter,

37:21.706 --> 37:23.708
incarcerated at Grayton,
released in May.

37:25.590 --> 37:28.473
Do you know that
Florida correctional officers
have their own Facebook group?

37:29.674 --> 37:30.695
I learned about it
when I was looking

37:30.795 --> 37:32.797
into the murder
of Niklas Lidstrom.

37:39.563 --> 37:41.565
Officer Lorde,
it is your lucky day.

37:42.927 --> 37:44.428
What's another word
for "friend" in Elvish?

37:44.528 --> 37:46.230
[Cammie chuckles] Oh, my God,
it's a prison play.

37:46.330 --> 37:47.911
"Mellon."

37:48.011 --> 37:50.094
Arvin and Dykstra,
together again.

37:50.974 --> 37:52.976
[siren wailing]

37:53.497 --> 37:55.719
It makes perfect sense!

37:55.819 --> 37:57.841
Dykstra brags about
your buried treasure to Arvin

37:57.941 --> 37:59.883
and tells him he's gonna
go after it once he gets out.

37:59.983 --> 38:00.884
[strained] Perfect sense.

38:00.984 --> 38:03.286
Then Arvin gets paroled,
relocates here,

38:03.386 --> 38:04.688
and waits for Dykstra's release

38:04.788 --> 38:06.329
so he can get in
on the buried treasure too.

38:06.429 --> 38:07.811
My heart... Palpitations.

38:07.911 --> 38:09.252
Dirt.

38:09.352 --> 38:10.694
Here, I got it from your place.

38:10.794 --> 38:12.295
You can hold on to it
instead of the scarf.

38:12.395 --> 38:14.337
[exhales deeply]

38:14.437 --> 38:15.658
What, home is
your safe place, right?

38:15.758 --> 38:17.460
This is like
a portable safe place.

38:17.560 --> 38:19.562
You did that for me? Thank you.

38:22.044 --> 38:25.528
[Cammie] Okay,
so this is supposedly
where Arvin lives.

38:28.250 --> 38:30.252
[suspenseful music playing]

38:31.574 --> 38:33.556
Get out.

38:33.656 --> 38:35.658
Get out of the car.

38:40.142 --> 38:42.524
[Bell] Psst.
Alligator breeding ground.

38:42.624 --> 38:45.127
The spike that I found
in Dykstra's shoe,
it was an egg tooth.

38:45.227 --> 38:47.229
-It's what baby gators use
to get out of their shell.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

38:51.993 --> 38:53.495
Open up.

38:53.595 --> 38:54.656
[grunts in frustration]

38:54.756 --> 38:56.758
I'm gonna go in.

39:01.843 --> 39:03.845
I found the metal detector.

39:05.767 --> 39:07.769
Ha!

39:09.691 --> 39:11.072
[grunts]

39:11.172 --> 39:13.935
[struggling]

39:24.985 --> 39:27.588
[somber music playing]

39:49.649 --> 39:51.651
[Cammie] You do not get to die.

39:54.414 --> 39:56.596
You do not get to die.

39:56.696 --> 39:58.978
Please don't die.

40:00.460 --> 40:02.462
[gasping]

40:03.463 --> 40:05.465
[Bell] You shot him.

40:05.905 --> 40:07.046
[Cammie] Yeah.

40:07.146 --> 40:09.148
Never fired my gun before.

40:10.309 --> 40:12.311
It was honestly
kind of thrilling.

40:12.872 --> 40:14.574
[grunts]

40:14.674 --> 40:16.675
For now, I'm gonna try not to
think what that says about me.

40:18.037 --> 40:20.039
[sighs] Okay.

40:20.439 --> 40:23.622
I got nothing to do with this.

40:23.722 --> 40:26.285
I've got an alligator
egg tooth that says otherwise.

40:30.249 --> 40:32.231
Consider this, Arvin.

40:32.331 --> 40:33.712
While you were at Grayton,

40:33.812 --> 40:37.035
Dykstra bragged to you
about a rich family
with buried treasure.

40:37.135 --> 40:39.598
When he got paroled,
he found out you moved here

40:39.698 --> 40:41.700
and were getting biblical
with his mermaid.

40:42.460 --> 40:44.242
I love her, okay?

40:44.342 --> 40:46.284
I was gonna blow
the whole treasure thing off,

40:46.384 --> 40:47.886
but then Jamie showed up
at my place.

40:47.986 --> 40:49.988
And then you followed him
to Bell's and killed him.

40:51.149 --> 40:52.450
Ow.

40:52.550 --> 40:54.812
Then why don't
I have the money? Hmm?

40:54.912 --> 40:56.214
Here's what I think.

40:56.314 --> 40:59.297
Using his metal detector,
you started digging,

40:59.397 --> 41:01.899
you damaged the fence,
and Moseley came after you.

41:01.999 --> 41:03.421
That's his pet alligator.

41:03.521 --> 41:05.783
All that time at Okahoochee
working with the gators

41:05.883 --> 41:08.105
gave you a soft spot,
didn't it, Arvin?

41:08.205 --> 41:09.587
It was either
kill Bill and Moseley

41:09.687 --> 41:11.689
and get the treasure or escape.

41:13.731 --> 41:15.272
He looked at me
with those eyes.

41:15.372 --> 41:18.035
You could murder someone
but you couldn't
kill an alligator?

41:18.135 --> 41:20.657
That makes you
a decent man, Arvin,
at least to me.

41:21.899 --> 41:23.720
As a decent man,
I would appreciate it

41:23.820 --> 41:25.482
if you could shed some light
on the connection

41:25.582 --> 41:27.704
between my wife
and Jamie Dykstra.

41:32.189 --> 41:34.191
You really wanna know?

41:36.833 --> 41:39.676
Jamie found out your wife
was having an affair
and he blackmailed her.

41:41.357 --> 41:43.359
That's how
he knew about the treasure.

41:44.200 --> 41:46.202
Vida told him.

41:53.569 --> 41:57.153
I arrested some limp dick
with a harpoon in Dorcas,

41:57.253 --> 42:01.077
rounded up eight howler monkeys
in Turkey Creek,

42:01.177 --> 42:04.520
yet somehow this is
the weird part of my day.

42:04.620 --> 42:07.243
And why is Prescott here?

42:07.343 --> 42:10.846
I'm turning myself in
for driving
with an expired license.

42:10.946 --> 42:13.329
You irritate
the hell out of me.

42:13.429 --> 42:15.931
Well, then,
perhaps the fine Officer Lorde

42:16.031 --> 42:18.033
can write me a ticket
and I'll be on my way.

42:19.434 --> 42:20.696
Right after I book Mr. Palanko

42:20.796 --> 42:22.798
for the murder
of Jamie Dykstra.

42:23.238 --> 42:25.240
You made an arrest?

42:25.760 --> 42:27.702
Yes, Sheriff Grant.

42:27.802 --> 42:29.384
I did.

42:29.484 --> 42:31.486
[country music playing
on speakers]

42:35.570 --> 42:37.792
You sure you wanna be here?

42:37.892 --> 42:42.677
I mean, the whole Vida thing,
it's a lot to process.

42:42.777 --> 42:45.780
Nothing a Gulf oyster
and a Hemingway daquiri
can't fix.

42:50.785 --> 42:52.787
[chuckles softly]

42:56.390 --> 42:58.392
Mm.

42:59.673 --> 43:01.495
Holy shit, that's good.

43:01.595 --> 43:03.597
[chuckles]

43:06.640 --> 43:08.422
Look at that sunset.

43:08.522 --> 43:09.943
Even if it is Florida,

43:10.043 --> 43:12.045
it should be illegal
for something
to be that beautiful.

43:14.528 --> 43:16.530
Yes, it should.

43:22.656 --> 43:24.657
I wasn't meaning you.

43:25.458 --> 43:26.439
That wasn't what was happening.

43:26.539 --> 43:27.640
Okay, okay.

43:27.740 --> 43:29.742
All right.

43:41.634 --> 43:43.636
Can I ask you something?

43:45.117 --> 43:47.580
Did you know
Vida was having an affair?

43:47.680 --> 43:50.022
Because if you did,
that would give you motive.

43:50.122 --> 43:52.124
And if you have motive...

43:53.045 --> 43:55.047
Before we discuss that...

43:57.049 --> 43:59.051
Why don't you tell me
who you really are?

44:00.252 --> 44:02.254
What are you talking about?

44:02.895 --> 44:04.896
Let's start
with Niklas Lidstrom,

44:05.657 --> 44:07.199
who thankfully
is very much alive

44:07.299 --> 44:10.282
and was one of the greatest
defensemen in NHL history.

44:10.382 --> 44:12.043
Played 20 seasons
for the Red Wings.

44:12.143 --> 44:13.845
Everyone from Detroit
knows Lidstrom.

44:13.945 --> 44:16.428
You don't.
Ergo, you're not from Detroit.

44:17.549 --> 44:20.091
Black people
don't do hockey, okay?

44:20.191 --> 44:22.874
Then there's that tattoo
on your wrist, "BMT."

44:23.755 --> 44:25.456
It's surely not a person.

44:25.556 --> 44:28.700
Does anyone bother with
the full monogram these days?

44:28.800 --> 44:30.822
Then I thought of your
slight diphthongal tendency.

44:30.922 --> 44:35.466
And that points us to New York
and leaves us with
Brooklyn Manhattan Transit.

44:35.566 --> 44:37.989
Meaningless to anyone
but a true New Yorker,

44:38.089 --> 44:41.332
say, one who was born near the
Brooklyn Manhattan subway line,

44:43.133 --> 44:45.516
who doesn't want anyone
to know that

44:45.616 --> 44:47.618
or anything else about her.

44:48.298 --> 44:51.402
For the same reason she runs
a quad VPN on her cell phone,

44:51.502 --> 44:54.384
in spite of the fact
that slows the damn thing down
to the speed of mud.

44:57.187 --> 44:58.889
You say I'm stuck in my past.

44:58.989 --> 45:00.450
I say
you're running from yours.

45:00.550 --> 45:02.552
-Shall I go on?
-No, you should not.

45:06.716 --> 45:08.718
Think you're so smart?

45:09.119 --> 45:11.121
That vial of dirt?

45:11.721 --> 45:13.723
It was Tyler's cocoa.

45:19.008 --> 45:21.170

Is this you?

Were you
having an affair, Vida?

46:50.096 --> 46:52.098
I thought we had
a future together.

46:53.500 --> 46:54.721
Didn't you?

46:54.821 --> 46:56.823
I could answer that,

46:57.223 --> 46:59.225
but I'm just a projection
of your grief.

47:01.628 --> 47:03.630
This isn't over, is it?

47:04.751 --> 47:06.132
It's not.

47:06.232 --> 47:08.234
I'll find your killer, Vida.
