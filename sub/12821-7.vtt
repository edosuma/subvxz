00:03.740 --> 00:07.260
The clocks are a map
to the true cross of christ.

00:07.260 --> 00:08.540
The shepherds have struggled
to protect the cross

00:08.540 --> 00:13.580
Once we find the cross,
it'll be a time of revelation.

00:14.340 --> 00:17.020
He was conscripted
into the nazi party

00:17.020 --> 00:19.140
For field research
on something called zero hour.

00:19.140 --> 00:20.980
I saw something
I can't explain.

00:20.980 --> 00:23.140
A nazi officer
with my face.

00:23.140 --> 00:25.420
Am I your son?

00:25.420 --> 00:26.380
There was a duffel bag.

00:26.380 --> 00:28.020
I decided
to take a peek inside.

00:28.020 --> 00:29.980
And there you were.

00:29.980 --> 00:31.340
Oh, my god.

00:31.340 --> 00:34.540
Unbelievable.
We found all the clocks.

00:34.540 --> 00:36.700
We need to meet.
It's time to end this.

<i>6 is the number of evil,</i>

00:48.160 --> 00:53.840
<i>But your foe, like the devil,</i>
<i>is sometimes the only way.</i>

01:55.060 --> 01:57.820
That wiretap we had
on hank's phone

01:57.820 --> 01:58.780
Is still active.

01:58.780 --> 02:00.580
This is from
late last night.

02:02.100 --> 02:05.260
<i>Hello, Hank.</I></i>

02:05.260 --> 02:07.420
<i><font><font>We need to meet.</font></font></i>
<i><font><font>It's time to end this.</font></font></i>

02:07.420 --> 02:10.620
<i><font><font>Laila, that's all</font></font></i>
<i><font><font>you have to say?</font></font></i>

02:10.620 --> 02:11.540
<i><font><font>"We need to meet"?</font></font></i>

02:11.540 --> 02:13.660
<font><font>Há mais. </font><font>Em pessoa.</font></font>

02:13.660 --> 02:15.300
<i><font><font>Certo.</font></font></i>

02:15.300 --> 02:16.540
<i><font><font>Mas eu definir os termos.</font></font></i>

02:16.540 --> 02:18.980
<i><font><font>Vou instruções de texto </font></font></i>
<i><font><font>em uma hora.</font></font></i>

02:18.980 --> 02:20.620
She's right here
in new york.

02:20.620 --> 02:21.980
Hank didn't tell you
about this?

02:52.820 --> 02:54.780
How you doing, laila?
How you been?

02:54.780 --> 02:56.540
What's going on?
Why isn't hank here?

02:56.540 --> 02:57.740
Because
he doesn't trust you.

02:57.740 --> 03:00.060
You don't understand.

03:00.060 --> 03:02.300
There's a bus pulling up
to that stop.

03:02.300 --> 03:04.540
If you want to meet hank,
be on it.

03:04.540 --> 03:06.700
One-time offer.

03:15.020 --> 03:17.820
Hey! Wait!

03:17.820 --> 03:18.940
Wait!

03:33.180 --> 03:34.260
Take off your jacket.

03:34.260 --> 03:36.060
It's good to see you.

03:36.060 --> 03:37.740
I don't want to hear it.
Just take off your jacket.

03:37.740 --> 03:40.300
All right.

03:40.300 --> 03:42.860
Switch with me.

03:47.700 --> 03:50.500
This is my stop.
Your stop is seven stops up.

03:50.500 --> 03:53.260
There are further instructions
under the bench.

03:53.260 --> 03:54.300
Hey.

03:55.740 --> 03:58.780
I'm really sorry...
About all of it.

03:58.780 --> 04:01.580
I really hope so.

04:21.740 --> 04:22.820
We lost her.

05:00.220 --> 05:01.980
That's quite the run-around
you gave me.

05:01.980 --> 05:03.380
You can drop the accent.

05:03.380 --> 05:05.300
I want to hear
your real voice.

05:05.300 --> 05:07.100
I just thought this would be
easier for --

05:07.100 --> 05:10.020
No... It's not.

05:12.780 --> 05:15.020
All right then.

05:15.020 --> 05:16.820
This is me.

05:18.820 --> 05:20.700
You know,
I never would have guessed

05:20.700 --> 05:22.100
That you'd have
a cruel streak.

05:22.100 --> 05:23.100
How so?

05:23.100 --> 05:24.460
<font><font>Vamos. </font></font><font><font>
me punir desse jeito?</font></font>

05:24.460 --> 05:27.860
<font><font>Fazendo-me conhecê-lo aqui </font></font><font><font>
, onde você primeiro ... </font><font>Proposta?</font></font>

05:27.860 --> 05:29.060
<font><font>Eu pensei que por aqui reunidos,</font></font>

05:29.060 --> 05:32.620
<font><font>Eu poderia ser capaz </font></font><font><font>
de ver direito ...</font></font>

05:32.620 --> 05:35.260
<font><font>Porque a última vez que </font></font><font><font>
estávamos na ponte,</font></font>

05:35.260 --> 05:39.780
<font><font>Eu estava tão nervoso </font></font><font><font>
que você ia dizer que não.</font></font>

05:39.780 --> 05:42.660
<font><font>E olhando para trás, </font></font><font><font>
que parece bastante estúpido,</font></font>

05:42.660 --> 05:45.500
'cause I could have proposed
on a garbage dump...
No.

05:45.500 --> 05:47.180
...And you would have
said yes

05:47.180 --> 05:48.620
Because it was your job
to say yes.

05:48.620 --> 05:51.340
No, no. It wasn't like that.
Hank, it --

05:51.340 --> 05:54.300
I do not need you
to defend your actions.

05:54.300 --> 05:57.140
I need you to explain them.

06:01.060 --> 06:02.140
All right.

06:02.140 --> 06:04.860
Come on.

06:04.860 --> 06:07.700
I want answers --
straight answers.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.700
Why were you
put in my life?

06:09.700 --> 06:12.540
To protect you.
Protect me? From what?

06:12.540 --> 06:14.140
I don't know.

06:14.140 --> 06:18.300
Why did you refer to me
as "subject 352"?

06:18.300 --> 06:21.580
All I know is that 352
has something to do

06:21.580 --> 06:24.820
With a scientific program
out of germany in 1938

06:24.820 --> 06:25.860
Called zero hour.

06:25.860 --> 06:27.900
The last lab we I.D.'d
was in paraguay,

06:27.900 --> 06:29.580
But the pyrates destroyed it.

06:29.580 --> 06:31.700
Yeah, santa marta clinic.

06:31.700 --> 06:33.500
Yes.

06:33.500 --> 06:38.060
I saw a film there
of a man -- 1971.

06:39.860 --> 06:40.820
Who is he?

06:40.820 --> 06:43.140
I don't know.

06:43.140 --> 06:45.660
Hank, please listen to me.

06:45.660 --> 06:47.780
My position
with the shepherds --

06:47.780 --> 06:50.620
It requires that I follow orders
on blind faith.

06:50.620 --> 06:51.820
Okay, then
here's an order.

06:51.820 --> 06:53.420
Tell your people

06:53.420 --> 06:56.580
That I am open to another stab
at a trade --

06:56.580 --> 06:59.580
This clock for some
real answers by tomorrow.

06:59.580 --> 07:02.100
Otherwise,
I'm gonna start talking

07:02.100 --> 07:04.300
To the other
interested parties.

07:04.300 --> 07:06.940
Hank.

07:06.940 --> 07:08.220
Hank, you don't want
to do that.

07:08.220 --> 07:09.580
Listen to me.

07:09.580 --> 07:12.060
The pyrates
are radical believers

07:12.060 --> 07:14.620
Committed to bringing about
the end of time

07:14.620 --> 07:16.980
So that they and they alone
might be delivered.

07:16.980 --> 07:18.660
Bible stories, fables.

07:18.660 --> 07:21.460
Not fables, fact.

07:21.460 --> 07:23.020
They want to force
the hand of god.

07:23.020 --> 07:24.380
I'm not gonna
let that happen.

07:24.380 --> 07:27.300
That's what this
is all about.

07:28.260 --> 07:30.180
From when we first met.

07:30.180 --> 07:32.860
<font><font>Talvez eu tenha sido designado </font></font><font><font>
para protegê-lo,</font></font>

07:32.860 --> 07:34.820
<font><font>Mas não termina aí </font></font><font><font>
para mim.</font></font>

07:34.820 --> 07:36.860
<font><font>Eu realmente amei.</font></font>

07:40.580 --> 07:41.620
I still do.

07:41.620 --> 07:44.380
That's a touching answer,

07:44.380 --> 07:47.420
But I don't remember
asking the question.

07:47.420 --> 07:50.380
Deliver the message.

08:02.860 --> 08:05.740
How was it?
How was she?

08:06.980 --> 08:08.340
Kind of hard to explain.

08:08.340 --> 08:10.460
<font><font>Bem, ela tem todas as respostas </font></font><font><font>
sobre os resultados de DNA?</font></font>

08:10.460 --> 08:12.900
<font><font>Gosto de como o inferno </font></font><font><font>
que poderia ser</font></font>

08:12.900 --> 08:15.700
<font><font>O pai biológico </font></font><font><font>
de um homem de 72 anos de idade?</font></font>

08:15.700 --> 08:17.820
<font><font>Acho que ela está sendo mantida </font></font><font><font>
no escuro sobre a maior parte.</font></font>

08:17.820 --> 08:21.940
<font><font>Corri todo o mind-ventilador </font></font><font><font>
por sam e Glenton em TI,</font></font>

08:21.940 --> 08:24.940
<font><font>E eles voltaram com as duas </font></font><font><font>
explicações mais prováveis ​​-</font></font>

08:24.940 --> 08:27.140
<font><font>Viagem no tempo </font></font><font><font>
ou reencarnação.</font></font>

08:29.700 --> 08:31.500
<font><font>Como é que ajudar </font></font><font><font>
de alguma forma?</font></font>

08:31.500 --> 08:34.140
<font><font>Através do processo </font></font><font><font>
de eliminação.</font></font>

08:34.140 --> 08:35.220
What?

08:37.419 --> 08:38.820
What is that clock
doing here?

08:38.820 --> 08:42.539
Yeah, well, we wanted to check
out the last clock erik found --

08:42.539 --> 08:47.500
I told you that that clock
leads back to clock number 1

08:47.500 --> 08:51.100
But the clocks are supposed to
show the way to the true cross.

08:51.100 --> 08:52.740
They can't just lead us
in a circle, right?

08:52.740 --> 08:55.220
Which got us thinking there
has to be something more to it.

08:55.220 --> 08:57.140
There's an engraving
in the bottom, see?

08:58.820 --> 09:00.140
Latin. Yeah.

09:02.380 --> 09:04.860
We had it translated,
if you want to check it out.

09:04.860 --> 09:07.020
"without 12, there is none.

09:07.020 --> 09:09.060
"with a dozen, there is one,

09:09.060 --> 09:11.660
"through which
divine light shines

09:11.660 --> 09:14.620
And reveals
the beginning of time."

09:30.700 --> 09:33.100
What kind of language
is that?

09:33.100 --> 09:34.620
Clear the room.

09:37.260 --> 09:39.300
Clear the room.

09:39.300 --> 09:42.700
I require privacy --
immediate privacy.

09:59.260 --> 10:01.900
You better have
a good reason for calling.

10:01.900 --> 10:04.140
Of course I do.

10:04.140 --> 10:08.620
I'm going to need the services
of a demotic translator.

10:08.620 --> 10:11.180
What have you found?

10:11.180 --> 10:16.100
The u-boat's navigation log,
coded in demotic.

10:16.100 --> 10:18.780
I'll have someone sent
immediately.

10:22.660 --> 10:24.940
White vincent.

10:24.940 --> 10:27.220
Don't worry.
I'm not angry.

10:27.220 --> 10:30.580
I recognize it was ignorance
that caused you

10:30.580 --> 10:31.660
To show him
where to find me.

10:31.660 --> 10:35.500
I also recognize
that, in a way,

10:35.500 --> 10:38.220
<font><font>Eu sou responsável </font></font><font><font>
por sua ignorância.</font></font>

10:38.220 --> 10:42.180
<font><font>Sempre entrega de mensagens </font></font><font><font>
sem saber o que dizer.</font></font>

10:42.180 --> 10:46.980
<font><font>Você vê, eu não </font></font><font><font>
adequadamente preparados você</font></font>

10:46.980 --> 10:48.860
<font><font>Para o dia do julgamento.</font></font>

10:48.860 --> 10:53.580
<font><font>O fim dos tempos está próximo, </font></font><font><font>
e que te enche de medo.</font></font>

10:53.580 --> 10:57.860
<font><font>Mas nem tudo precisa perecer </font></font><font><font>
sob a ira de Deus.</font></font>

10:59.380 --> 11:01.900
<font><font>Certamente </font></font><font><font>
não o preparado.</font></font>

11:03.620 --> 11:07.460
<font><font>Oh, heads up. </font></font><font><font>
Há uma tempestade vindo em nossa direção.</font></font>

11:12.460 --> 11:14.500
<font><font>Hey, beck. </font></font><font><font>
quero falar </font></font><font><font>
com Hank sozinho.</font></font>

11:14.500 --> 11:16.220
<font><font>Sim, com certeza. </font><font>Você se lembrou </font></font><font><font>
de verificar a sua arma para a porta?</font></font>

11:16.220 --> 11:17.540
<font><font>Porque eles são as regras.</font></font>

11:19.260 --> 11:20.900
<font><font>Você está certo. </font></font><font><font>
Isso não é realmente uma regra.</font></font>

11:22.500 --> 11:24.020
<font><font>Você viu Laila.</font></font>

11:24.020 --> 11:27.700
<font><font>Você a conheceu sem fbi </font></font><font><font>
envolvimento e sem mim.</font></font>

11:27.700 --> 11:29.740
You know how badly
I want answers

11:29.740 --> 11:32.420
About my husband's death,
but you cut me out.

11:32.420 --> 11:34.940
I didn't think, okay?
You didn't think.

11:34.940 --> 11:36.940
Is that so hard to believe?
It is, yes.

11:36.940 --> 11:38.780
In fact, I think
you're lying right now.

11:38.780 --> 11:40.220
Lying?

11:40.220 --> 11:42.660
Not necessarily to me,
but certainly to yourself.

11:42.660 --> 11:44.220
You are so desperate
to believe

11:44.220 --> 11:45.580
That the woman
you fell in love with,

11:45.580 --> 11:48.340
That -- that some part
of the life that you shared

11:48.340 --> 11:50.220
Was as real to her
as it was to you.

11:50.220 --> 11:52.740
I think that's why
you met with her alone --

11:52.740 --> 11:55.460
To offer her the chance,
however slight,

11:55.460 --> 11:56.940
To say or do something

11:56.940 --> 11:59.020
That would convince you
that she still cares,

11:59.020 --> 12:00.300
That she ever cared.

12:00.300 --> 12:03.380
I get that an expertise
in reading people

12:03.380 --> 12:04.660
Is part
of your job description,

12:04.660 --> 12:08.460
That you can see inside
of my head, my heart?

12:08.460 --> 12:10.540
I don't need to see inside.

12:10.540 --> 12:11.900
You're still wearing
your wedding ring.

12:13.420 --> 12:16.180
You contact laila again
without fbi involvement,

12:16.180 --> 12:18.140
And I may just have to
arrest you.

12:18.140 --> 12:20.620
Uh, aiding and abetting
a criminal

12:20.620 --> 12:23.260
With potential ties
to a known terrorist.

12:23.260 --> 12:24.220
White vincent?

12:24.220 --> 12:25.420
Well, that's where
you're wrong.

12:25.420 --> 12:27.340
They're both looking
for the clocks,

12:27.340 --> 12:28.740
But they are working
for different sides.

12:28.740 --> 12:32.220
Is that
what the liar told you?

12:49.820 --> 12:52.140
Father.

12:52.140 --> 12:54.260
I've been reflecting
on hank's demands,

12:54.260 --> 12:55.460
And I've come to a decision.

12:55.460 --> 12:56.860
From this point forward,

12:56.860 --> 12:59.020
I will personally
take over negotiations.

13:00.300 --> 13:02.860
You --
you're cutting me out?

13:02.860 --> 13:05.100
No, sparing you
further entanglement.

13:05.100 --> 13:07.580
Hank is only looking
for answers.

13:07.580 --> 13:09.980
As are we all.

13:09.980 --> 13:13.740
For my own solace, father,
I-I really need to know --

13:13.740 --> 13:16.300
What is hank's role
in all of this?

13:17.740 --> 13:23.940
In the end, god's love
is all we really need.

13:23.940 --> 13:25.380
That's all we really have.

13:25.380 --> 13:27.180
Right?

13:28.700 --> 13:32.380
Yes.
I'm -- I'm sorry, father.

13:32.380 --> 13:34.860
No, I-I understand the --

13:34.860 --> 13:36.700
The great burden
that you've been shouldering --

13:36.700 --> 13:41.740
Your years with hank,
your attachment.

13:41.740 --> 13:45.420
That the pain and confusion
that you feel now

13:45.420 --> 13:48.860
Will only leave
by letting go.

13:48.860 --> 13:51.820
When we destroy the bridges
behind us,

13:51.820 --> 13:54.940
We're left no choice
but to move forward.

14:02.540 --> 14:03.780
We have a problem.

14:03.780 --> 14:06.940
That a demotic translator
has been hired

14:06.940 --> 14:09.340
To join a salvage operation
in the north sea.

14:09.340 --> 14:11.820
The pyrates must have
recovered sturm's sub.

14:11.820 --> 14:15.100
The sub that he used to
transport the true cross

14:15.100 --> 14:18.180
If they found something
on board, some clue,

14:18.180 --> 14:20.500
They could uncover
the location of the cross.

14:20.500 --> 14:21.780
Not if we find it first.

14:21.780 --> 14:23.900
Hank galliston
has been lying to us.

14:23.900 --> 14:25.660
He doesn't possess
one clock.

14:25.660 --> 14:27.540
He has
all the remaining clocks.

14:27.540 --> 14:30.380
Then we do have a chance to
beat the pyrates to the cross,

14:30.380 --> 14:32.860
Which means we --
we must hasten negotiations

14:32.860 --> 14:36.100
We must protect the location
of the true cross.

14:36.100 --> 14:39.180
The only way to do that is
to take his clocks...

14:39.180 --> 14:40.780
And his life.

14:54.640 --> 14:55.920
Hello? Hank?

14:55.920 --> 14:57.160
Hey. Over here.

14:57.160 --> 14:59.840
I was on my way home
when I got your call.

14:59.840 --> 15:01.360
Thanks for coming over,
really.

15:01.360 --> 15:03.920
You do realize it's almost 2:00
in the morning.

15:03.920 --> 15:05.520
I asked laila
for another meeting,

15:05.520 --> 15:06.800
And I thought
you should know.

15:06.800 --> 15:09.040
I see.

15:09.040 --> 15:15.280
And... I wanted you to know
that... We're in this together.

15:15.280 --> 15:17.360
You were right.

15:17.360 --> 15:19.720
It's time for me
to let her go.

15:23.760 --> 15:26.320
Yeah, I wore mine for two years
before I took it off.

15:26.320 --> 15:28.160
One less reminder,
you know?

15:28.160 --> 15:31.440
It's one thing to say
you're moving on,

15:31.440 --> 15:34.000
But to actually make it
happen...

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
And then seeing her.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
That must have been
hard as hell.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.400
It was.

15:39.400 --> 15:41.600
I mean, at first.

15:41.600 --> 15:44.240
But then
I looked into her eyes,

15:44.240 --> 15:48.840
And it was like a complete
stranger staring back at me.

15:48.840 --> 15:51.760
Yeah, and you're sure
you want to do this sting?

15:51.760 --> 15:54.160
I mean, it could go bad
for laila.

15:54.160 --> 15:56.520
I don't care.
I want you on this.

15:56.520 --> 16:01.960
I mean, laila, anna, whatever
it is we're calling her --

16:01.960 --> 16:06.000
That woman
I owe exactly nothing.

16:08.200 --> 16:10.480
You keep on
surprising me, hank.

16:10.480 --> 16:12.840
You're a lot tougher
than I first thought.

16:12.840 --> 16:14.640
And you're a bit softer.

16:16.160 --> 16:18.560
It's funny how that works.

16:22.880 --> 16:26.920
So... What's the plan
for beck riley...

16:28.240 --> 16:29.880
...After all this is over?

16:31.840 --> 16:35.120
You know, I haven't told
a single person.

16:35.120 --> 16:36.400
Well, then tell me.

16:41.120 --> 16:44.400
Well, this fbi job --
it's a means to an end.

16:45.920 --> 16:47.600
But it's --
it's not me, you know?

16:49.480 --> 16:53.880
So when this is over...
I'm done.

16:53.880 --> 16:55.880
I want to go back
to who I was.

16:55.880 --> 16:58.800
Be a social worker again?

16:58.800 --> 17:01.400
I want to be happy again.

17:02.960 --> 17:07.640
I want to fly around the world
without a gun on my hip.

17:07.640 --> 17:09.400
I want to get lost.

17:09.400 --> 17:11.880
I want to forget
any of this ever happened.

17:11.880 --> 17:14.160
Sounds pretty perfect.

17:14.160 --> 17:16.400
What about you?

17:16.400 --> 17:18.560
What's
the hank galliston plan?

17:20.720 --> 17:21.920
I'm still working on it.

17:41.880 --> 17:45.160
You must be professor challis,
my demotic translator.

17:45.160 --> 17:47.360
Oh, well, I'm the only guy
not wearing rubber boots,

17:47.360 --> 17:48.800
So, yeah, I guess
that must be me.

17:48.800 --> 17:51.840
So thank you for flying here
so quickly.

17:51.840 --> 17:55.400
A find like this comes along
once in a lifetime.

17:55.400 --> 17:57.400
So I'm told.

17:57.400 --> 17:59.960
Uh, your, um --
your specialty again?

17:59.960 --> 18:02.480
You're -- you're -- you're
an archaeologist of some sort?

18:02.480 --> 18:05.600
You might say
I have an interest

18:05.600 --> 18:07.120
In buried treasures.

18:07.120 --> 18:10.960
Only a half-dozen people
on earth know this language.

18:10.960 --> 18:12.760
How long will it take
to translate?

18:12.760 --> 18:16.520
Well, um... Let's see.

18:16.520 --> 18:18.640
Some irregular conjugations.

18:18.640 --> 18:19.600
And if you look over here --

18:19.600 --> 18:21.680
Best guess, please.

18:21.680 --> 18:26.240
I don't know.
Um... Eight hours, tops.

18:26.240 --> 18:28.720
Where the hell
did you find this stuff?

18:28.720 --> 18:29.840
Translate that first.

18:29.840 --> 18:31.280
Then
when you're finished...

18:32.560 --> 18:34.960
...There's plenty of time
for conversation.

18:39.880 --> 18:41.640
Hello?

18:41.640 --> 18:45.120
Hello. Hank.
It's father reggie.

18:45.120 --> 18:46.960
I know
you're expecting laila.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.880
So you're a shepherd
after all.

18:48.880 --> 18:51.160
Yes. I prefer to speak
the truth, and now I can.

18:51.160 --> 18:55.600
And right now...
I need your clocks.

18:55.600 --> 18:57.600
Clock -- singular.

18:57.600 --> 18:59.360
No, we found
sturm's son, hank.

18:59.360 --> 19:01.840
He told us what you have,
so please.

19:01.840 --> 19:04.200
There are eight clocks
in play,

19:04.200 --> 19:06.320
And I had to take over
these negotiations.

19:06.320 --> 19:07.720
All right. Negotiate.

19:07.720 --> 19:09.200
All the clocks...

19:09.200 --> 19:12.240
For all your answers.

19:12.240 --> 19:15.680
Someone will meet you in 10
minutes at grand ferry park.

19:15.680 --> 19:16.720
Okay.

19:16.720 --> 19:18.200
Grab your jackets.
We're leaving.

19:18.200 --> 19:19.640
Hank, you cannot just give him
these clocks.

19:19.640 --> 19:21.680
I am not planning on it.

19:21.680 --> 19:22.960
That call was not
about a meeting.

19:22.960 --> 19:25.400
They want to find out
where we hid the clocks.

19:25.400 --> 19:27.280
The only way we could meet
in 10 minutes --

19:27.280 --> 19:29.120
Is if all the clocks
were here.

19:29.120 --> 19:31.120
I guarantee you
they're watching this building.

19:31.120 --> 19:32.400
How are we gonna get them out?

19:32.400 --> 19:34.880
The boiler room
of our building

19:34.880 --> 19:36.360
Connects
to our next-door neighbor,

19:36.360 --> 19:37.800
So, arron, I want you
to go out the back.

19:37.800 --> 19:39.440
If you see anybody, run.

19:39.440 --> 19:42.280
Rachel, the lady
I double-park with --

19:42.280 --> 19:44.720
They're not gonna be
watching for her car.

19:44.720 --> 19:46.160
But that means
you have to take the clocks.

19:46.160 --> 19:47.480
You up for that?

19:47.480 --> 19:49.640
Of course.
But what about you?

19:49.640 --> 19:52.280
Arron and I get the fun part.
We're the decoys.

20:56.560 --> 20:58.960
Hank!

20:58.960 --> 21:00.720
Please, please.

21:00.720 --> 21:02.880
Hank,
let's go for a drive.

21:26.560 --> 21:28.480
It's beautiful, isn't it?

21:28.480 --> 21:29.680
Living in the city,

21:29.680 --> 21:33.080
We forget how much god
is out here in nature.

21:33.080 --> 21:34.040
Tell me why I'm here.

21:34.040 --> 21:35.360
I'll explain everything
inside.

21:35.360 --> 21:38.240
Rachel, please stay out here
with father zoller.

21:38.240 --> 21:41.120
I will not wait outside.
What do you want with hank?

21:41.120 --> 21:43.200
Don't worry.
I'll be okay.

22:07.520 --> 22:10.560
Please, right this way.

22:27.200 --> 22:29.800
After almost a century,

22:29.800 --> 22:33.480
The 12 clocks
are finally brought home.

22:35.840 --> 22:40.640
Together, they contain the route
to the true cross.

22:41.720 --> 22:44.440
We need you to unlock
this final puzzle.

22:44.440 --> 22:46.800
Well, you've spent more time
with these clocks

22:46.800 --> 22:52.200
But, more importantly, this has
always been your task, hank.

22:52.200 --> 22:53.640
From the moment
you were born,

22:53.640 --> 22:55.840
Your destiny has been tied
to the cross.

22:55.840 --> 22:57.080
What does that mean?

22:57.080 --> 22:59.560
Unlock this puzzle,
and you get your answers.

22:59.560 --> 23:01.520
Despite all this,
I'm still a man of my word.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.480
Are you on board
the ship?

23:09.480 --> 23:10.880
Yeah, I'm here.

23:10.880 --> 23:12.840
But I don't know how much
they've translated.

23:12.840 --> 23:15.080
Then you'd better
find that out.

23:21.880 --> 23:23.840
Oh. Hey.

23:23.840 --> 23:27.560
Yeah, I'm, uh, just looking
for the cleaning supplies --

23:27.560 --> 23:29.440
You know, bleach, mop.

23:29.440 --> 23:31.440
You seen anything
like that around?

23:31.440 --> 23:34.240
Well, this is, um, basically
scientific equipment.

23:34.240 --> 23:35.280
Sorry.

23:35.280 --> 23:37.320
No, don't worry about it.

23:38.720 --> 23:40.120
What's that
you're working on?

23:40.120 --> 23:41.960
Oh, this?
It's kind of technical.

23:41.960 --> 23:43.840
I got my a.A. Degree, man.
Try me.

23:43.840 --> 23:45.640
Well, okay.

23:45.640 --> 23:49.480
Basically, um, I'm translating
this navigation log

23:49.480 --> 23:53.600
This may tell us where
they stopped on their journey.

23:53.600 --> 23:56.200
Why they were in the arctic
in the first place.

23:56.200 --> 23:59.360
Don't talk his head off,
professor.

23:59.360 --> 24:02.920
After all, he's just a man
looking for bleach.

24:04.160 --> 24:08.560
It's usually my habit to run
extensive background checks

24:08.560 --> 24:10.560
On people under my employ.

24:10.560 --> 24:17.240
So let's consider this a first
formal interview, shall we?

25:16.960 --> 25:19.480
Please... Don't kill me.

25:32.640 --> 25:35.200
Father mark,
I need to speak with you.

25:35.200 --> 25:37.040
I'm sorry, laila.
I have precious little time.

25:37.040 --> 25:40.080
You brought me into this.
I'm only here because of you.

25:41.840 --> 25:43.840
I need to know about hank.

25:45.120 --> 25:46.720
I'm sorry,
but I'm not at liberty

25:46.720 --> 25:48.800
To tell you any more
than you've been told.

25:48.800 --> 25:50.400
I understand.

25:50.400 --> 25:52.200
You remember flight 71?

25:52.200 --> 25:53.200
Of course.

25:53.200 --> 25:54.320
I booked you on that flight

25:54.320 --> 25:56.400
To safely escort dr. Riley
out of moscow.

25:56.400 --> 25:59.320
Then you must also remember
the car crash --

25:59.320 --> 26:02.920
The reason I never made
that flight.

26:05.080 --> 26:08.600
My cab struck that bus
in our rush to the airport.

26:08.600 --> 26:11.520
The driver was... Killed,

26:11.520 --> 26:15.520
And I miraculously
walked away...

26:15.520 --> 26:18.320
Or, rather, I crawled.

26:18.320 --> 26:22.040
As I lay there on the street,

26:22.040 --> 26:23.960
Running prayers
through my head --

26:23.960 --> 26:28.960
For the driver, for myself --
I saw it, the message.

26:28.960 --> 26:29.960
What message?

26:31.520 --> 26:34.520
352.

26:34.520 --> 26:38.840
Subject 352...Hank.

26:40.320 --> 26:41.360
It was a sign.

26:41.360 --> 26:44.000
I was put in hank's life
for a reason.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.280
I must know why.

26:48.800 --> 26:52.600
"without 12, there is none.

26:52.600 --> 26:56.160
"with a dozen, there is one,

26:56.160 --> 27:00.640
"which through
divine light shines

27:00.640 --> 27:05.120
To reveal
the beginning of time."

27:05.120 --> 27:07.960
"with a dozen, there is one."

27:07.960 --> 27:10.120
One what? One clock?

27:10.120 --> 27:11.760
One map? One --

27:20.400 --> 27:21.600
What do
you think you're doing?

27:21.600 --> 27:23.640
She can't be here.
Why not?

27:23.640 --> 27:26.520
Who has sacrificed more
for our cause than her?

27:26.520 --> 27:27.360
Have you?

27:27.360 --> 27:30.240
This is about more
than your personal needs.

27:30.240 --> 27:33.200
My needs are god's needs.
My faith has never wavered.

27:33.200 --> 27:35.520
Not yet.

27:35.520 --> 27:38.240
I know what needs to be done,
and when the time comes...

27:39.920 --> 27:42.160
...I won't flinch.

27:53.980 --> 27:56.860
I guess it's a little late
to apologize.

27:58.220 --> 28:00.380
You could say that, yeah.

28:00.380 --> 28:03.460
Well, maybe we should
just get down to it.

28:03.460 --> 28:04.380
I'm here to help.

28:04.380 --> 28:06.340
Okay.

28:06.340 --> 28:09.740
One thing... Help.

28:09.740 --> 28:13.020
There's an identical piece
of glass in every clock

28:13.020 --> 28:15.860
That doesn't have anything
to do with the clock design.

28:15.860 --> 28:17.460
It's just an extra piece.

28:17.460 --> 28:21.780
And you used to tell me
that in a perfect clock --

28:21.780 --> 28:24.300
Every piece
serves a purpose.

28:26.780 --> 28:28.380
Tell me you have
some idea of where they are.

28:28.380 --> 28:30.060
Not yet,
but we're working on it.

28:30.060 --> 28:31.940
Take a seat,
make yourself comfortable.

28:31.940 --> 28:33.340
Can't -- can't you, like,
trace their cellphones

28:33.340 --> 28:34.340
Or -- or something?

28:34.340 --> 28:36.140
Their phones
were turned off.

28:36.140 --> 28:37.780
We're doing everything
we can.

28:37.780 --> 28:39.500
Well, there's got to be
something else you can do.

28:39.500 --> 28:40.740
You're the fbi.
This is your job.

28:40.740 --> 28:41.820
Take it easy.

28:41.820 --> 28:43.100
You're not the only one
worried here.

28:43.100 --> 28:44.860
If I say I'm doing
everything I can, I mean it.

28:44.860 --> 28:47.660
Finally, one piece of good news.
We got a plate hit.

28:47.660 --> 28:49.220
Oh, thank god.
Let me see.

28:49.220 --> 28:51.540
A license-plate camera
I.D.'d the abduction vehicle,

28:51.540 --> 28:54.300
Well, that's good, right?
That's a good lead.

28:54.300 --> 28:55.300
That's very good.

28:55.300 --> 28:56.860
The cameras tracked the car

28:56.860 --> 28:59.060
Getting off 87 north
outside of rosendale.

28:59.060 --> 29:00.860
Well, there's a lot
of empty land out there.

29:00.860 --> 29:02.860
They could be anywhere.
So we narrow the search.

29:02.860 --> 29:04.220
They're shepherds,
holy men, right?

29:04.220 --> 29:05.500
So we look for properties
out there

29:05.500 --> 29:07.380
Getting
religious tax breaks.

29:07.380 --> 29:09.860
This is crazy.

29:09.860 --> 29:11.820
At least tell me
what they're doing in there.

29:11.820 --> 29:14.100
I can't get this one.

29:14.100 --> 29:16.260
I'm afraid
I'm gonna break it.

29:16.260 --> 29:17.300
Careful.

29:17.300 --> 29:19.900
Almost there.

29:22.260 --> 29:24.100
Nice catch.

29:24.100 --> 29:25.220
Thank you.

29:27.900 --> 29:29.820
12 pieces of glass.

29:29.820 --> 29:32.580
"with a dozen,
there is one."

29:32.580 --> 29:34.540
One what?
What do we do with them?

29:34.540 --> 29:38.180
Verse said, "through
which divine light shines."

29:38.180 --> 29:40.620
Divine light -- it's
god's spirit, his essence.

29:40.620 --> 29:42.940
Or maybe
it just means light.

29:47.700 --> 29:49.060
Ahh...

29:49.060 --> 29:52.700
So they etched a pattern
into the glass,

29:52.700 --> 29:53.820
But... What is it?

29:53.820 --> 29:55.740
What is it?
What am I looking at?

29:55.740 --> 29:58.740
Nothing yet.

29:58.740 --> 30:00.500
But if we put them
together...

30:07.140 --> 30:11.980
...Maybe that's how 12
becomes one.

30:16.740 --> 30:20.620
Ahh. I don't see anything --
just lines.

30:20.620 --> 30:24.220
There's got to be some way
to align these.

30:24.220 --> 30:27.180
Hey, there's
a tiny, little divot here.

30:27.180 --> 30:30.140
You can barely see it.
This has one, too.

30:30.140 --> 30:33.500
Let's put all the divots
on the top.

30:45.460 --> 30:51.020
That's what the shepherds hid
all those years ago.

30:51.020 --> 30:52.980
It's
an out-of-proportion map.

30:52.980 --> 30:56.900
The map must be broken
or warped by time?

30:56.900 --> 30:58.300
Maybe it was meant to be warped.

30:58.300 --> 31:00.900
You ever wonder why
they scattered the clocks

31:00.900 --> 31:04.820
You have to go all the way
to the arctic to do that?

31:04.820 --> 31:06.700
India?

31:06.700 --> 31:10.860
Maybe the location
is part of the puzzle.

31:13.140 --> 31:17.180
12 apostles, 12 locations.

31:17.180 --> 31:19.100
Arctic circle...

31:19.100 --> 31:20.380
Chennai...

31:20.380 --> 31:22.060
Princeton...

31:22.060 --> 31:23.980
Wismar...
Istanbul...

31:23.980 --> 31:27.140
And erik -- he told me he found
his clocks in reykjavik.

31:27.140 --> 31:28.220
Jakarta...

31:28.220 --> 31:30.500
Saka...

31:30.500 --> 31:31.860
Port-au-prince...

31:31.860 --> 31:33.980
Shiraz...

31:33.980 --> 31:35.300
Cayenne.

31:37.180 --> 31:39.580
All the hiding places
on the map...

31:39.580 --> 31:41.500
Form a perfect circle.

31:41.500 --> 31:45.500
Look -- 12 points,
just like a clock.

31:45.500 --> 31:47.660
Only thing missing
are the hands.

31:47.660 --> 31:48.860
The hands always originate
at the center.

31:58.380 --> 32:03.100
That's where the clocks lead --
strasbourg.

32:03.100 --> 32:04.580
Where all the clocks
were made.

32:04.580 --> 32:06.460
The beginning of time.

32:09.980 --> 32:11.340
I've done my end
of the bargain.

32:12.860 --> 32:14.820
Now it's your turn.

32:19.020 --> 32:21.500
Yes?

32:21.500 --> 32:24.460
The fbi? How close?

32:27.260 --> 32:30.940
Hank,
I promised you answers,

32:30.940 --> 32:32.900
And a man of the cloth
keeps his word.

32:32.900 --> 32:37.980
Your life is a direct result
of project zero hour,

32:37.980 --> 32:40.100
A scientific program

32:40.100 --> 32:42.940
That harnesses the power
of the true cross

32:42.940 --> 32:44.820
To bring about
the end of days.

32:44.820 --> 32:46.660
How?

32:46.660 --> 32:51.260
The cross, if it's even real,
is just a piece of wood.

32:51.260 --> 32:54.140
Yes, but within that wood

32:54.140 --> 32:57.180
Is a power greater
than 1,000 atomic bombs.

32:57.180 --> 32:59.220
What does that have to do
with me?

32:59.220 --> 33:01.340
Hank,
you are the detonator.

33:01.340 --> 33:04.700
Father... A moment.

33:07.540 --> 33:09.340
We must leave -- now.

33:12.220 --> 33:14.300
I understand.

33:22.220 --> 33:23.300
God forgive me.

33:35.300 --> 33:37.220
Anna...

33:38.300 --> 33:39.740
aah!

33:49.060 --> 33:50.060
Let's go.

33:50.060 --> 33:51.620
Laila, what are you --
move.

34:03.220 --> 34:05.420
The charts
have been translated.

34:05.420 --> 34:07.740
Will they prove helpful
in our search?

34:07.740 --> 34:11.179
I'm confident to have
the cross in my possession

34:11.179 --> 34:12.139
Within the week.

34:12.139 --> 34:14.540
Good.

34:14.540 --> 34:15.820
No loose ends.

34:24.179 --> 34:27.260
You don't understand a word
I'm saying, do you?

34:29.420 --> 34:33.860
I know you lost your parents,
and that's a hard thing.

34:33.860 --> 34:35.820
But you don't have to be
afraid anymore.

34:35.820 --> 34:38.980
We'll take care of you.

34:38.980 --> 34:42.540
Salvation is almost here.

34:46.380 --> 34:48.260
No, I haven't forgotten.

34:48.260 --> 34:51.300
I'm just visiting
with our new patient.

34:52.940 --> 34:55.820
Now, where were we?

34:55.820 --> 34:58.700
The seven bowls
of god's wrath.

34:58.700 --> 35:02.500
"the fourth angel poured
out his bowl on the sun.

35:02.500 --> 35:04.420
"and it was given to him

35:04.420 --> 35:07.380
"to afflict man
with heat and fire.

35:07.380 --> 35:11.180
And men were scorched
by the great heat."

35:17.060 --> 35:20.900
"and they cursed
the name of god."

35:31.300 --> 35:32.860
Please, please,
don't -- don't kill me.

35:32.860 --> 35:35.180
I-I did everything
you asked.

35:35.180 --> 35:37.740
Yeah.
You've proven very helpful,

35:37.740 --> 35:39.940
Which is why I'm going
to offer you

35:39.940 --> 35:41.300
A chance for survival.

35:41.300 --> 35:44.060
I suggest
you take a running jump.

35:44.060 --> 35:46.220
That's your best hope
on missing the propeller blades.

35:48.780 --> 35:51.660
Unless you don't feel up
for the challenge.

35:55.580 --> 35:57.740
Can I at least have
a life preserver?

35:59.300 --> 36:02.100
Of course.

36:02.100 --> 36:05.060
But you better hurry.

36:05.060 --> 36:06.860
The longer you hesitate,

36:06.860 --> 36:09.260
The less likely
it will prove useful.

36:12.220 --> 36:14.020
Good luck.

36:22.380 --> 36:24.140
Come on!

36:30.860 --> 36:32.060
I know her.
Are you okay?

36:32.060 --> 36:34.740
I'm fine, I'm fine.
Where's hank?

36:34.740 --> 36:36.260
I was hoping
he was with you.

36:54.060 --> 36:55.740
Nobody followed us.

36:55.740 --> 36:57.060
Sorry.

36:57.060 --> 36:58.700
You can relax.

36:58.700 --> 37:01.940
I thought it was the only way
you'd agree to come with me.

37:06.060 --> 37:08.580
Hank's phone just turned on.
We got a solid signal.

37:08.580 --> 37:09.820
Where?
Grand central.

37:09.820 --> 37:11.820
He knows
we're tracking his phone.

37:11.820 --> 37:13.580
He's leading us
right to her.

37:13.580 --> 37:17.980
You've got the fbi
and the shepherds after you.

37:17.980 --> 37:21.340
You just gonna create another
identity and disappear?

37:21.340 --> 37:24.060
No. I'm gonna go
to strasbourg,

37:24.060 --> 37:26.180
And I am gonna find
the true cross

37:26.180 --> 37:27.140
And I'm gonna destroy it.

37:27.140 --> 37:29.340
Why?

37:29.340 --> 37:31.940
You heard what they said
about you and the cross.

37:31.940 --> 37:34.220
They're never gonna stop
hunting you.

37:34.220 --> 37:35.500
You want me to believe

37:35.500 --> 37:38.060
That you will destroy
the cross of christ?

37:38.060 --> 37:39.660
Why would you do that?

37:39.660 --> 37:41.140
If jesus were here now

37:41.140 --> 37:43.980
And he saw that people
were willing to kill

37:43.980 --> 37:46.020
Over possession
of the cross,

37:46.020 --> 37:48.580
I believe that he would
tell me to destroy it

37:48.580 --> 37:49.780
Because it's just a symbol.

37:49.780 --> 37:51.620
Two pieces of wood,
nothing more.

37:57.220 --> 37:58.860
Will you come with me?

38:02.700 --> 38:05.820
Beck is probably hunting us
with half the fbi.

38:05.820 --> 38:07.900
How could we
possibly get away?

38:07.900 --> 38:09.740
I know how to avoid the fbi.
I can show you.

38:09.740 --> 38:11.860
You haven't told me
one true thing.

38:11.860 --> 38:13.700
How can I
possibly trust you?

38:13.700 --> 38:15.540
I don't know, hank.
Tell me.

38:15.540 --> 38:16.620
What -- what do you need?

38:16.620 --> 38:18.580
Answer one question.

38:18.580 --> 38:19.740
Yeah, anything.

38:19.740 --> 38:22.220
The day that I proposed,

38:22.220 --> 38:24.260
You told me that that was
the happiest day of your life.

38:24.260 --> 38:28.260
After we kissed,
you cried and you rushed off

38:28.260 --> 38:31.180
To call your mother
and tell her the good news...

38:32.780 --> 38:38.700
Or... Did you run away,
call the shepherds,

38:38.700 --> 38:41.300
And tell them
that the plan had worked?

38:44.340 --> 38:45.580
Yes.

38:47.540 --> 38:49.740
That's exactly what I did.

38:51.900 --> 38:52.940
That's all
I needed to hear.

39:13.620 --> 39:15.260
Wait. There must be
some kind of mistake.

39:15.260 --> 39:16.460
The signal says
they're here.

39:25.100 --> 39:28.100
Hi. Um,
did you happen to see...
