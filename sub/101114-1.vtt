WEBVTT

00:35.069 --> 00:36.670
They say when you die,

00:36.738 --> 00:39.239
your whole life flashes
before your eyes.

00:45.913 --> 00:47.782
I wish it were that simple.

00:51.919 --> 00:54.421
James.

01:01.528 --> 01:04.664
You have till the end of the day
or your ass is out of here.

01:09.402 --> 01:11.072
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:11.139 --> 01:12.472
Coming.

01:15.408 --> 01:16.643
James!

01:16.711 --> 01:18.378
Okay!

01:18.445 --> 01:19.412
Okay, uh...

01:19.479 --> 01:20.614
You're four fuckin' days late.

01:20.680 --> 01:21.615
Where is my rent?

01:21.681 --> 01:22.582
I know and...

01:22.649 --> 01:25.019
- 500 bucks and now.
- Okay.

01:25.086 --> 01:28.890
Good talk.

01:28.956 --> 01:32.425
You have till the end of the day
or your ass is out of here.

01:32.492 --> 01:35.029
Okay, okay,
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

01:35.096 --> 01:36.063
Keep the change, Ben.

01:36.130 --> 01:37.799
Are you listening to me, James?

01:37.865 --> 01:39.967
Hey!

01:40.034 --> 01:41.869
Are you listenin' to me?

01:41.936 --> 01:43.470
I'll get it to you today.

01:46.439 --> 01:47.108
5:00.

01:47.175 --> 01:49.744
No fucking later.

01:49.811 --> 01:55.049
Like I said,
if this were simple to explain, I'd do it.

02:01.856 --> 02:02.924
Let me start here.

02:04.058 --> 02:05.126
7th round.

02:05.193 --> 02:10.163
Everything you see
has played out before.

02:10.231 --> 02:14.601
You just don't know it.

02:14.668 --> 02:16.170
See most people live their lives

02:16.237 --> 02:19.506
only experiencing
the present moment,

02:19.573 --> 02:22.076
that fleeting snapshot
that's here one second,

02:22.143 --> 02:25.412
gone the next.

02:25.478 --> 02:27.547
Man, I just need
like a dollar for lunch.

02:27.614 --> 02:29.549
People call it
"clairvoyance" or "presentiment".

02:29.616 --> 02:32.419
Man, I just need
like a dollar for lunch.

02:32.485 --> 02:34.088
Elliot called it "entanglement",

02:34.155 --> 02:35.790
some quantum string theory
bullshit

02:35.857 --> 02:37.691
about different events
ringing out

02:37.758 --> 02:40.493
across space and time.

02:40.560 --> 02:42.696
Oh!
Watch yourself, cowboy.

02:42.763 --> 02:44.431
Like signals from a satellite
crossing over

02:44.497 --> 02:45.800
into different frequencies.

02:55.508 --> 02:58.946
I guess you
could say I got a strong antenna.

02:59.013 --> 02:59.981
Oh, okay.

03:01.648 --> 03:04.118
Dude, you're killin' me here.

03:04.185 --> 03:05.585
Well, let's double down.

03:05.652 --> 03:07.654
Red shorts, goes down at 7:00.

03:07.722 --> 03:10.590
Hey, I've got a good feeling
about this one.

03:10.657 --> 03:11.625
You wanna get in on this.

03:11.691 --> 03:15.096
You wanna scam the system,
go ahead,

03:15.162 --> 03:18.900
but don't drag my ass down
with you.

03:18.966 --> 03:21.869
Alright, well, can you give me
a bottle whiskey at least.

03:21.936 --> 03:24.839
Can you do that much?

03:24.906 --> 03:26.908
Gonna pay me
with my own money, huh?

03:26.974 --> 03:28.743
That's right.

03:28.809 --> 03:30.610
I'm sick of this shit.

03:34.081 --> 03:38.719
Either way,
doesn't mean I'm special or anything.

03:38.786 --> 03:41.756
Just means this lousy life
has played out before

03:41.822 --> 03:45.592
and somehow
I'm stuck watching the rerun.

03:52.934 --> 03:54.035
You fuckin' bitch.

03:54.101 --> 03:56.503
Payday.

03:57.838 --> 03:59.206
Here we go.

03:59.273 --> 04:00.908
You fuckin' bitch!

04:05.913 --> 04:07.614
Hey, asshole!

04:07.681 --> 04:08.515
Get the fuck out of here,

04:08.581 --> 04:09.951
- fuckhead.
- Stop!

04:10.017 --> 04:10.952
Look, I don't wanna
go through the motions here,

04:11.018 --> 04:11.719
but let's get this over with,
huh?

04:11.786 --> 04:13.553
You hit me, I hit you.

04:13.620 --> 04:14.587
Mind your own fuckin' business.

04:14.654 --> 04:15.689
Believe me, man,
I would if I could.

04:15.756 --> 04:16.958
- Come on.
- Are you fuckin' kidding me?

04:17.024 --> 04:19.559
This is kind of where you're
supposed to hit me.

04:23.931 --> 04:24.999
Get off me!

04:31.138 --> 04:32.206
Double-teaming me, huh?

04:33.708 --> 04:36.476
Oh.

04:38.145 --> 04:39.814
Get the fuck off me.

04:45.086 --> 04:46.053
There.

04:53.693 --> 04:55.162
How you like that?

04:55.229 --> 04:56.998
- Oh!
- Cocksucker.

05:06.140 --> 05:07.975
You okay?

05:08.042 --> 05:10.711
Fine.

05:10.778 --> 05:12.980
Assholes ran off together.

05:13.047 --> 05:14.415
Hey.

05:14.482 --> 05:19.220
Oh, hey, looks like our friend
left us a little somethin'.

05:19.286 --> 05:21.322
Mmhmm.

05:21.389 --> 05:23.758
Payday.

05:23.824 --> 05:26.727
Who could have guessed?

05:26.794 --> 05:31.032
Here, your nose, it's bleeding.

05:31.098 --> 05:34.735
Oh, nice of you.

05:34.802 --> 05:38.105
Hey, uh, sorry about those guys.

05:38.172 --> 05:40.007
Why'd you do that?

05:40.074 --> 05:42.209
What, get my ass kicked?

05:42.276 --> 05:43.878
He was twice your size.

05:43.944 --> 05:46.679
Well, the bigger they are,
the harder they fall.

05:52.685 --> 05:53.653
Uh... use your shower?

06:01.228 --> 06:03.630
You just zoned out.

06:03.696 --> 06:06.734
Sorry, I just...

06:06.801 --> 06:09.870
You look kind of familiar.

06:09.937 --> 06:14.641
You were so
original for like 15 seconds.

06:14.708 --> 06:19.213
I was actually being
kinda serious.

06:19.280 --> 06:22.917
I'm James.

06:22.983 --> 06:24.085
Angela.

06:24.151 --> 06:27.021
Angela.

06:27.088 --> 06:30.291
Listen,
I should probably get going.

06:30.357 --> 06:31.658
Where are you headed?

06:31.725 --> 06:35.863
Just passing through,
looking for work so...

06:35.930 --> 06:38.232
Well, I don't wanna stop you
from doin' what you're doin',

06:38.299 --> 06:42.269
but if you ever wanna
take a break from drivin',

06:42.336 --> 06:43.404
I'm just around the corner.

06:43.471 --> 06:45.739
Above Blue Chip Auto,
it's a repair shop.

06:50.344 --> 06:52.346
Hangin' out in the
alleyways now, Jimmy?

06:52.413 --> 06:53.747
Sal?

06:58.352 --> 07:00.087
Been a long time, kid.

07:00.154 --> 07:00.988
When did you get out?

07:01.055 --> 07:02.223
A couple of months ago.

07:02.289 --> 07:03.190
You are a mess.

07:03.257 --> 07:04.158
What happened to you?

07:04.225 --> 07:05.092
Playground scuffle.

07:05.159 --> 07:06.093
Ah!

07:06.160 --> 07:07.728
Yeah.
You look good.

07:07.795 --> 07:10.798
Oh, kept me lean and clean
in there.

07:10.865 --> 07:13.134
Is he a chaperone or what?

07:13.200 --> 07:15.970
Terry, meet James.

07:16.036 --> 07:17.705
Met him inside.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.473
Who's this?

07:19.540 --> 07:21.475
This is uh, Angela.

07:21.542 --> 07:22.843
- Hi.
- Hey.

07:22.910 --> 07:24.111
Pleasure, sweetheart.

07:24.178 --> 07:26.113
You don't mind if I borrow
your man for a second?

07:26.180 --> 07:28.115
- Oh, he's not my...
- Hey... hey, we just met.

07:28.182 --> 07:29.884
Yeah.

07:29.950 --> 07:32.086
We won't be too long.

07:32.153 --> 07:35.256
Ray wants to talk.

07:35.322 --> 07:36.991
About what?

07:37.057 --> 07:40.094
You mean to say you don't know?

07:40.161 --> 07:41.729
Not yet.

07:41.795 --> 07:43.030
You're gonna wanna hear
from him.

07:44.932 --> 07:46.901
So let's go talk some business.

07:46.967 --> 07:49.370
One sec.

07:49.436 --> 07:53.807
Okay, you earned
at least half of this.

07:56.377 --> 07:57.378
Okay.

07:57.444 --> 07:58.479
I'll see you around, okay?

07:58.546 --> 08:00.014
Yeah.

08:09.123 --> 08:10.124
Get to a gas station.

08:10.191 --> 08:11.358
Get this guy cleaned up.

08:19.266 --> 08:20.234
Okay.

08:23.103 --> 08:24.271
Time to see Ray.

08:30.411 --> 08:31.378
Hey, Jeff.

08:38.452 --> 08:39.919
How's it going, kid?

08:39.986 --> 08:41.255
Hey, Sal.

08:41.322 --> 08:42.423
Right.

08:42.489 --> 08:44.024
Now, if you want cotton,
as opposed to satin,

08:44.091 --> 08:47.194
that's a whole different thing.

08:47.261 --> 08:49.196
But it has to be doubled.

08:49.263 --> 08:51.165
That's what I said.

08:51.232 --> 08:52.533
Right.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.401
Okay, good.

08:54.468 --> 08:56.470
Done.

08:56.537 --> 08:58.305
Jesus fucking Christ.

08:58.372 --> 09:01.942
Drapes weighin' you down?

09:02.009 --> 09:04.378
Jimmy, in the flesh.

09:04.445 --> 09:05.579
Where you been hiding?

09:05.646 --> 09:07.548
Haven't been hiding, Ray,
just doin' my thing.

09:07.615 --> 09:08.349
Thought maybe you were
hangin' out

09:08.415 --> 09:11.318
with Professor Fruit Loop.

09:11.385 --> 09:13.087
I haven't seen him in a while.

09:13.153 --> 09:15.422
That's good.

09:15.489 --> 09:19.226
Walk with me.

09:19.293 --> 09:21.528
So how's life?

09:21.595 --> 09:24.565
It's day-to-day, you know?

09:24.632 --> 09:26.967
All that skill and no will.

09:27.034 --> 09:29.169
Here I am bustin' my schmeckle
nickel-and-diming dudes

09:29.236 --> 09:31.438
over the square inch
of a fucking curtain

09:31.505 --> 09:32.640
and you...

09:32.707 --> 09:35.542
You know, what I would do
if I had your brain?

09:35.609 --> 09:38.245
Try to take over the world?

09:38.312 --> 09:39.213
Exactly.

09:42.549 --> 09:44.251
You want a drink?

09:44.318 --> 09:45.552
Sir.

09:45.619 --> 09:46.520
I thought you don't drink.

09:46.587 --> 09:47.588
I don't.

09:47.655 --> 09:50.557
Four years
and not a fuckin' meeting.

09:50.624 --> 09:54.161
How do you like them apples?

09:54.228 --> 09:55.262
Sit.

09:58.332 --> 10:03.003
You meet Sal's buddy Terry
from the joint?

10:03.070 --> 10:07.408
What'd you get in there for,
Terry?

10:07.474 --> 10:09.576
Second-degree.

10:09.643 --> 10:12.146
What, you couldn't get first?

10:12.212 --> 10:13.280
You see that?

10:13.347 --> 10:16.183
All will, no skill.

10:16.250 --> 10:20.154
Drink up.

10:20.220 --> 10:23.891
So Sal says you wanna talk to me
about somethin'.

10:23.957 --> 10:26.527
Yes,
I got a proposition for you.

10:26.593 --> 10:28.295
One that might get you out
of your day-to-day ways

10:28.362 --> 10:31.598
and me out of this
fabric fuckin' purgatory.

10:31.665 --> 10:33.233
Okay, I'm listenin'.

10:47.214 --> 10:49.183
What are you finally
proposing to me?

10:49.249 --> 10:53.020
You're lookin' at
over 10 million VVS1 diamond.

10:53.087 --> 10:55.189
You don't even need
to know what that means,

10:55.255 --> 10:57.458
just that they're flawless,
rare,

10:57.524 --> 11:00.260
and worth a fuckin' fortune.

11:00.327 --> 11:03.497
So since when are you
moving diamonds?

11:03.564 --> 11:06.934
I became acquainted
with these guys from Zimbabwe.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.603
I heard they stole 'em
from some dudes in Angola.

11:09.670 --> 11:13.006
What happens in Africa stays
in Africa.

11:13.073 --> 11:14.274
I told him
that I could move them

11:14.341 --> 11:15.676
for the right price.

11:15.744 --> 11:18.445
The only problem is the FBI
is so far up my fuckin' ass

11:18.512 --> 11:20.080
they're comin' out of my mouth.

11:20.147 --> 11:21.682
I thought you were done
with this kind of stuff.

11:21.750 --> 11:24.118
I mean, you know,
after what happened.

11:24.184 --> 11:25.386
We're adjusting.

11:25.452 --> 11:27.521
No more showing coke
or whatever the fuck else was

11:27.588 --> 11:29.556
in the linin' of those curtains.

11:29.623 --> 11:31.726
So what do you want from me?

11:31.793 --> 11:35.028
I need you to do that thing
you do in that head of yours.

11:35.095 --> 11:38.365
I need you to find safe passage
for these

11:38.432 --> 11:41.969
and then you can find yourself
100 grand freer.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.203
100 grand?

11:43.270 --> 11:45.105
Yeah,
it's a lot of fucking coin, right?

11:45.172 --> 11:46.206
And I would imagine
it would go a long way

11:46.273 --> 11:49.009
toward keeping that low profile
of yours.

11:51.445 --> 11:53.180
Mmm, halle-fuckin'-lujah.

11:56.718 --> 11:59.019
Hey, I know that look.

11:59.086 --> 12:03.524
You saw something, didn't you?

12:03.590 --> 12:05.993
What?
What is it?

12:06.059 --> 12:06.994
I saw the handoff.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.730
Mmm, halle-fuckin'-lujah!

12:08.797 --> 12:11.398
- And I want 2 grand upfront.
- Oh.

12:11.465 --> 12:16.003
Hey, I got shit to pay off,
you want me, I want 2 grand.

12:18.205 --> 12:19.606
Alright.

12:19.673 --> 12:22.376
Look at you makin' easy money.

12:22.443 --> 12:24.278
You know,
how many blinds I gotta sell

12:24.344 --> 12:26.280
to make 2 grand?

12:26.346 --> 12:27.948
Tax-free.

12:30.284 --> 12:32.619
1, 2.

12:32.686 --> 12:34.021
So what's the next move?

12:34.087 --> 12:37.491
Gonna take those diamonds,
spend a little time with them,

12:37.558 --> 12:38.992
figure out the rest.

12:39.059 --> 12:40.260
I gotta get this deal
done in the next couple of days

12:40.327 --> 12:41.361
or it's dead

12:41.428 --> 12:42.696
and I'm not about to go back
on my word

12:42.764 --> 12:44.164
with these Zimbabwe freaks.

12:44.231 --> 12:45.566
The visions come
when they come up,

12:45.632 --> 12:50.504
I can't change that.

12:50.571 --> 12:52.039
You do what you do
in that head of yours,

12:52.105 --> 12:54.341
but you do it quick.

12:54.408 --> 12:56.477
24 hours.

12:56.543 --> 12:57.978
Understood?

12:59.379 --> 13:00.647
Alright.

13:00.715 --> 13:05.185
Sal and Terry will help you out
with whatever you need.

13:05.252 --> 13:07.722
Here's my Burner number.

13:07.789 --> 13:10.290
Call it when we're ready to go.

13:20.133 --> 13:25.405
That's both our lives
in your hands, right?

13:25.472 --> 13:26.507
I got this.

13:37.284 --> 13:38.619
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:38.685 --> 13:40.187
I got your money.

13:42.790 --> 13:43.925
- Hey.
- Hi.

13:43.992 --> 13:46.794
I just came by
to give you a little thank-you

13:46.861 --> 13:48.695
for you know,
getting your ass kicked

13:48.763 --> 13:52.165
and the guy stole your booze.

13:52.232 --> 13:53.467
Plus,
I don't really know anyone here

13:53.534 --> 13:58.572
and I thought you might wanna
hang out or somethin'.

13:58.639 --> 13:59.741
Wow.

13:59.807 --> 14:01.041
And uh, it's...
it's kind of inappropriate,

14:01.108 --> 14:06.179
but um, just wondering
if I could use your shower.

14:06.246 --> 14:08.348
I mean the shelter looks
really nice and all, but...

14:08.415 --> 14:09.483
So beer and thank-yous aside,

14:09.550 --> 14:10.852
but really you're just knockin'
on my door

14:10.919 --> 14:13.487
to use my Sea Breeze body wash?

14:13.554 --> 14:14.521
Is that weird?

14:14.588 --> 14:15.790
Mm...

14:17.624 --> 14:18.592
Come on.

14:25.833 --> 14:28.402
Welcome to my abode.

14:28.468 --> 14:29.536
Wow!

14:29.603 --> 14:33.173
It's a cool place
takin' it you live alone.

14:33.240 --> 14:34.141
Ouch!

14:34.207 --> 14:35.242
Is it that obvious?

14:35.309 --> 14:37.845
It could use a woman's touch
in places.

14:37.912 --> 14:39.781
I'll keep that in mind.

14:39.847 --> 14:44.284
And I walked into the home
of a serial killer.

14:44.351 --> 14:47.220
That's uh...
it's how I get my thoughts out.

14:47.287 --> 14:50.691
It's a lot of thoughts.

14:50.758 --> 14:52.693
Are these your parents?

14:52.760 --> 14:53.560
Yeah, sort of.

14:53.627 --> 14:57.932
Um, that's my foster dad Elliot.

14:57.999 --> 14:58.866
And that's my mom.

14:58.933 --> 15:01.301
- That's really sweet.
- Sweet?

15:01.368 --> 15:03.838
Yeah,
it says somethin' about you.

15:03.905 --> 15:06.640
I don't know what that would be.

15:06.708 --> 15:07.641
Here you go.

15:16.718 --> 15:19.954
So are you still in contact
with your mom

15:20.021 --> 15:23.758
or your foster dad?

15:23.825 --> 15:27.461
Um, no.

15:27.527 --> 15:28.562
Elliot...

15:30.597 --> 15:33.567
...uh,
he's a little overbearing, so...

15:35.669 --> 15:37.337
What about you?

15:37.404 --> 15:39.707
Your parents around?

15:39.774 --> 15:40.708
No.

15:44.012 --> 15:45.880
Anyways, I... I...

15:45.947 --> 15:49.917
I figure this life is up to me.

15:49.984 --> 15:53.420
I... yeah.

15:53.487 --> 15:56.791
Well, someday all that you see
could be yours.

16:10.805 --> 16:16.343
Uh, you mentioned somethin'
about Sea Breeze body wash.

16:16.410 --> 16:18.578
- Right.
- As an option.

16:18.645 --> 16:19.680
Yeah, I did.

16:19.747 --> 16:20.715
Mmhmm.

16:24.986 --> 16:26.253
Okay.

16:31.793 --> 16:32.827
Watch your beer.

16:34.862 --> 16:37.297
Shit.

16:37.364 --> 16:38.498
Your reward.

16:38.565 --> 16:39.934
Oh yeah.

16:40.001 --> 16:41.268
And I can share yours.

16:41.334 --> 16:42.269
Yeah, that's what you think.

16:47.474 --> 16:48.843
What?

16:50.978 --> 16:54.882
What about him saying
that he saw the handoff?

16:54.949 --> 16:56.650
You know, how many things are
in that guy's head,

16:56.718 --> 16:58.385
who knows what he saw?

16:58.452 --> 17:00.755
Maybe he saw it handed to you.

17:00.822 --> 17:01.856
Ever think about that?

17:03.958 --> 17:05.291
That's right.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.560
That's right.

17:07.627 --> 17:09.463
Just for once,
I wanna be the guy

17:09.529 --> 17:12.066
that gets the fuckin' prize
in his hands, you know?

17:12.133 --> 17:13.166
You stay focused

17:13.233 --> 17:15.970
and that's exactly
what's gonna happen.

17:16.037 --> 17:18.472
For the both of us.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.842
Now, I'm gonna be right here,
engine running.

17:20.907 --> 17:23.711
You get in, take the bag,
get the fuck out, nothing more.

17:23.778 --> 17:24.746
Okay?
No blood.

17:24.811 --> 17:28.381
- Yeah, sure.
- Hey, say it.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.684
I get in, get the bag,
and get the fuck out.

17:30.752 --> 17:31.753
No blood.

17:31.819 --> 17:33.054
Yeah, but if something goes down
and I...

17:33.121 --> 17:35.857
You wanna spend another chapter
of your life in jail?

17:35.923 --> 17:37.457
This is our chance.

17:37.524 --> 17:41.495
We do this right,
everything changes.

17:41.561 --> 17:42.395
Alright?

18:52.767 --> 18:54.168
The visions
come when they come up,

18:54.235 --> 18:55.937
I can't change that.

19:08.850 --> 19:10.918
Oh.

19:35.243 --> 19:36.177
We gotta go.

19:36.244 --> 19:37.577
Get this on.

19:42.582 --> 19:44.684
- Come on, come on.
- What are you... what?

19:44.752 --> 19:45.720
Don't get freaked out,

19:45.786 --> 19:46.921
but there is someone
in my apartment.

19:46.988 --> 19:48.155
What?

19:48.222 --> 19:49.156
Come on, come on.

19:50.690 --> 19:51.792
...on upper ground.

19:51.859 --> 19:53.560
Go, go on, go.

19:53.627 --> 19:54.795
Please, he's out there.

19:54.862 --> 19:57.198
I... I...
what the fuck is happening?

19:57.265 --> 19:58.065
- Just please move out, okay?
- Who is that?

19:58.132 --> 19:59.133
- Come on.
- Open the door!

19:59.200 --> 20:01.168
Here, here.

20:01.235 --> 20:02.970
- Alright.
- Open the fuckin' door!

20:07.208 --> 20:08.142
Oh fuck!

20:08.209 --> 20:09.977
Jesus, was that a gunshot?

20:10.044 --> 20:10.811
Just run, keep going.

20:11.913 --> 20:13.180
Come on, come on, come on,
let's go.

20:18.719 --> 20:19.619
Just run.

20:19.686 --> 20:20.687
There's a ladder
around the back.

20:20.755 --> 20:21.588
Sal, he's running.
He's running, Sal!

20:21.655 --> 20:22.422
- Go, go, go.
- Just tell me

20:22.489 --> 20:24.792
what the hell is happening.

20:24.859 --> 20:25.927
I will,
but first let's just get out of here.

20:25.993 --> 20:26.961
Go, go.

20:28.662 --> 20:29.562
Head to the freeway.

20:29.629 --> 20:30.331
Who would be breaking in?

20:30.398 --> 20:31.531
I don't know.

20:34.969 --> 20:37.104
Hey!

20:37.171 --> 20:38.538
Fuck, did I tell you.

21:01.295 --> 21:03.697
Why do you have those?

21:03.764 --> 21:04.464
James?

21:04.531 --> 21:05.333
Been a while.

21:05.399 --> 21:06.334
Well, you can cut the bullshit,

21:06.400 --> 21:07.768
'cause I can see it
on your face.

21:07.835 --> 21:12.206
You're gonna black out on me
every time I ask you a question?

21:12.273 --> 21:13.207
Gotta talk to Elliot.

21:13.274 --> 21:15.076
Elliot, what?

21:15.142 --> 21:15.910
- Wait, whoa.
- Shit.

21:15.977 --> 21:17.111
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:20.014 --> 21:21.548
What is that?

21:22.350 --> 21:24.551
Pop the hood.

21:29.622 --> 21:30.690
How bad is it?

21:37.664 --> 21:38.665
There's a motel.

21:38.733 --> 21:39.499
Let that engine cool off
for the night.

21:39.566 --> 21:41.235
If it overheats, it'll cease.

21:41.302 --> 21:43.104
Shit.

21:43.170 --> 21:44.839
Okay.

21:44.905 --> 21:46.974
Uh, he... he's gonna say
somethin' about a motel,

21:47.041 --> 21:49.110
that we should let the engine
cool down for the night

21:49.176 --> 21:51.112
- or it'll cease.
- Who?

21:51.178 --> 21:52.113
The police.

21:52.179 --> 21:53.147
The police?

21:57.184 --> 21:58.719
- How did you...
- Play it cool.

21:58.786 --> 22:00.520
Just do the talkin', alright?

22:09.662 --> 22:11.265
Good evening, folks.

22:11.332 --> 22:12.800
Everything alright?

22:12.867 --> 22:16.837
Yes, officer,
just some engine troubles.

22:21.442 --> 22:22.609
You called for a tow?

22:22.675 --> 22:24.812
Uh, we don't have a phone.

22:28.916 --> 22:30.985
Looks like your cooling system.

22:31.052 --> 22:32.319
You'll probably get
a dozen miles,

22:32.386 --> 22:36.390
but if it overheats,
it'll cease.

22:36.457 --> 22:39.794
There's a motel,
maybe a few exits down the road.

22:39.860 --> 22:42.096
Might be a good idea
to let that engine cool off

22:42.163 --> 22:44.265
for the night.

22:44.331 --> 22:45.900
You folks have a good evening.

22:54.275 --> 22:58.379
How did you know?

22:58.446 --> 23:00.014
We should get to that motel.

23:06.454 --> 23:07.288
How'd you know he'd say that?

23:07.354 --> 23:08.089
Every now and then, I get lucky.

23:08.155 --> 23:10.324
James, come on talk to me.

23:10.391 --> 23:12.059
What do you wanna talk about?

23:12.126 --> 23:13.194
You wanna act like a dick

23:13.260 --> 23:15.129
and pretend
like that didn't just happen?

23:15.196 --> 23:17.064
You dragged me out here.

23:17.131 --> 23:19.433
The least you can do is
tell me the truth.

23:21.202 --> 23:23.804
Whatever.

23:34.181 --> 23:35.883
I see things.

23:39.153 --> 23:40.653
Like what?

23:44.825 --> 23:46.927
Things that haven't
happened yet.

23:46.994 --> 23:50.764
Snippets or visions or whatever.

23:58.439 --> 24:02.009
What do you mean visions?

24:02.076 --> 24:03.811
Like déjà vu?

24:06.413 --> 24:10.718
It's more fragmented than that.

24:10.784 --> 24:14.989
I see... I see pieces.

24:15.055 --> 24:19.059
Happen when they happen
and always come true.

24:22.930 --> 24:24.231
What did you see?

24:28.435 --> 24:29.970
I saw a gun firing

24:30.037 --> 24:33.274
and a bullet hitting me
in the chest.

24:33.340 --> 24:34.708
Jesus.

24:38.812 --> 24:40.381
We should get off the road.

24:56.964 --> 24:58.999
Listen,
after the car cools down,

24:59.066 --> 25:00.801
if you wanna drop me
at Elliot's

25:00.868 --> 25:03.037
and get out of here,
I understand.

25:12.246 --> 25:14.148
Charming.

25:14.215 --> 25:15.449
Uh-huh?

25:15.516 --> 25:16.517
I'll be back.

25:16.584 --> 25:19.253
Okay.

25:24.358 --> 25:26.560
Yeah.

25:44.144 --> 25:46.413
<i>And we're
back to the 7th round.</i>

25:49.216 --> 25:51.118
What?

25:51.185 --> 25:54.221
I didn't take
you for a sports fan.

25:54.288 --> 25:57.958
Well, it's one way
to pass the time I guess.

25:58.025 --> 26:01.295
You bet on them, don't you?

26:01.362 --> 26:03.897
No, that would be immoral.

26:03.964 --> 26:04.898
Of course.

26:04.965 --> 26:07.034
- And I...
- You are a stand-up guy.

26:07.101 --> 26:08.469
I am basically a saint, yes.

26:08.535 --> 26:10.371
I know, I've seen.

26:10.437 --> 26:13.207
Mmhmm.

26:16.577 --> 26:20.247
How long have you mm,
been like this?

26:26.353 --> 26:29.923
My mother died when I was
7 years old, a car accident.

26:35.195 --> 26:38.932
I saw two months
before it happened.

26:38.999 --> 26:40.334
You saw it?

26:45.005 --> 26:45.673
Why don't
we listen to the radio...

26:45.740 --> 26:47.007
I drew it.

26:47.074 --> 26:48.075
Hey,
what do you wanna listen to?

26:52.946 --> 26:55.015
Did you tell anyone?

26:55.082 --> 26:56.617
Did you try to stop it?

26:56.684 --> 26:59.219
Uh-uh,
I didn't know what it meant.

26:59.286 --> 27:01.088
Oh!

27:05.225 --> 27:08.429
I can't imagine what that
would have done to a kid.

27:11.498 --> 27:14.234
I drew everything
I saw back then.

27:14.301 --> 27:19.673
I didn't realize that it wasn't
just my imagination.

27:19.741 --> 27:23.644
I guess
that's when I first knew.

27:23.712 --> 27:25.379
Knew what?

27:28.482 --> 27:30.351
That our choices don't matter.

27:33.120 --> 27:35.422
Life happens beyond our control.

27:37.691 --> 27:42.696
So all the shit
that I grew up with...

27:42.764 --> 27:46.934
All that sadness...

27:47.000 --> 27:48.936
was fated.

27:57.010 --> 28:00.381
That's a shitty way
of seeing the world.

28:05.018 --> 28:07.621
Doesn't mean it's not true.

28:25.472 --> 28:27.541
Did you see that coming?

28:56.771 --> 28:58.105
Do you reckon me?

28:58.172 --> 28:59.106
That's me.

28:59.173 --> 29:00.207
Yeah.

29:00.274 --> 29:01.575
Yeah.

29:06.513 --> 29:07.648
Oh fuck, no.

29:07.715 --> 29:08.348
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

29:08.415 --> 29:09.216
This is impossible.

29:09.283 --> 29:11.084
How is this fucking is possible?

29:13.454 --> 29:14.188
We're not safe here.

29:14.254 --> 29:14.889
We gotta go, we gotta go.

29:14.955 --> 29:15.723
Angela, we gotta go.

29:15.790 --> 29:16.925
Come on, come on.

29:16.990 --> 29:19.794
I hope it's
probably in the safe.

29:19.861 --> 29:21.528
Who... who could've gone
into that safe?

29:21.595 --> 29:22.797
I don't know.

29:22.864 --> 29:26.433
Maybe the same guys
who broke into my apartment.

29:26.500 --> 29:27.702
Maybe they got
what they wanted and...

29:27.769 --> 29:31.238
And now things are gonna change.

29:31.305 --> 29:33.440
No, no.
This is still part of it.

29:39.112 --> 29:40.447
Just stay on this road.

29:40.514 --> 29:43.250
Another half hour,
we'll be at Elliot's.

29:43.317 --> 29:45.419
He's been trying to help me
figure this out since I was kid.

30:13.480 --> 30:15.750
Hey.

30:15.817 --> 30:18.652
What are you doing here?

30:18.720 --> 30:19.486
Um...

30:21.221 --> 30:22.757
This is Angela.

30:22.824 --> 30:25.125
Hi.

30:25.192 --> 30:26.426
I'm Elliot.

30:30.464 --> 30:32.099
Come in.

30:37.671 --> 30:39.774
It's been a while.

30:39.841 --> 30:42.844
How you doin'?

30:42.911 --> 30:44.111
Alright.

30:44.177 --> 30:45.679
Just alright?

30:45.747 --> 30:47.214
Yeah.

30:47.281 --> 30:48.215
Well, you can cut the bullshit,

30:48.282 --> 30:52.787
'cause I can see it
on your face.

30:52.854 --> 30:54.288
Tell him.

30:58.492 --> 31:01.695
I saw my death.

31:01.763 --> 31:03.196
What?

31:07.735 --> 31:12.539
How did this happen?

31:12.606 --> 31:14.776
- Ray asked me to...
- I warned you, didn't I?

31:14.842 --> 31:16.577
Elliot.

31:16.643 --> 31:18.211
He's a criminal, James.

31:18.278 --> 31:19.546
I had no choice,
I needed the work...

31:19.613 --> 31:21.682
Of course, you had a choice.

31:21.749 --> 31:22.750
It's not what I saw.

31:22.817 --> 31:24.551
Oh, for God's sakes.

31:24.618 --> 31:25.720
Just because you see
ahead of you

31:25.787 --> 31:28.155
does not mean
that you're impotent to choose.

31:28.221 --> 31:29.857
That's a theory, Elliot.

31:29.924 --> 31:31.224
You know
that's not how it works.

31:31.291 --> 31:33.193
I know how you work.

31:33.260 --> 31:35.830
You see a future,
it's yours to steal,

31:35.897 --> 31:38.599
and you're gonna see a future
where you're a crook,

31:38.665 --> 31:41.769
but you start applying yourself,
and then your future changes.

31:41.836 --> 31:43.537
This is not why I came here.

31:51.244 --> 31:52.646
Where does this happen?

31:56.516 --> 31:58.652
Whatever he's done,
I can sort this out for you.

32:05.793 --> 32:07.361
What did you see?

32:09.897 --> 32:11.766
No, please, no!

32:13.533 --> 32:15.770
Happens here.

32:15.837 --> 32:21.675
Oh my God.

32:21.743 --> 32:25.312
It's all in here, your drawings.

32:25.379 --> 32:29.884
Everything you've seen since
we started working together.

32:29.951 --> 32:31.551
You've always seen this.

32:40.293 --> 32:41.561
Why didn't you tell me
about this?

32:41.628 --> 32:42.897
Well, right now you've got to do
everything in your power

32:42.964 --> 32:43.630
to change this.

32:43.697 --> 32:45.298
You've got to leave now.

32:45.365 --> 32:47.534
It makes no difference
what I do.

32:47.601 --> 32:49.169
It never has.

32:57.644 --> 32:59.881
You really understand
how his ability works.

32:59.947 --> 33:01.916
Well, it's more
of an affliction, sadly.

33:01.983 --> 33:03.918
You make it sound
like a disease.

33:06.988 --> 33:09.690
Just get him to leave.

33:09.757 --> 33:11.726
Please.

33:11.793 --> 33:12.794
Excuse me a moment.

33:50.131 --> 33:51.565
Is this me?

33:55.069 --> 33:59.306
Why didn't you tell me?

33:59.372 --> 34:00.708
I drew a lot of stuff back then.

34:00.775 --> 34:03.443
I don't...

34:03.510 --> 34:05.378
I don't remember half of it.

34:05.445 --> 34:06.881
So I'm a part of this.

34:08.949 --> 34:10.752
I've always been a part of this.

34:16.991 --> 34:18.726
Can I tell you something?

34:20.962 --> 34:26.466
That moment today,
when we met on the street,

34:26.533 --> 34:28.635
you said
that you'd seen me before.

34:32.405 --> 34:35.710
I believed you.

34:35.777 --> 34:37.011
You made fun of me
for saying that.

34:38.079 --> 34:39.813
Well,
it was a cheesy line to say.

34:45.018 --> 34:47.822
But I felt it, too.

35:04.437 --> 35:06.774
I can't escape what I saw.

35:07.942 --> 35:09.442
I'm not gonna accept that.

35:09.509 --> 35:11.611
We have to try.
We have to at least try.

35:11.678 --> 35:12.814
- Come on, James.
- Angela.

35:12.880 --> 35:13.781
Please.

35:17.018 --> 35:19.419
Hey, open up!

35:19.486 --> 35:21.155
Professor, let's go,
open the door!

35:21.222 --> 35:22.957
Elliot?

35:23.024 --> 35:25.760
Elliot, we're gonna go.

35:25.827 --> 35:26.961
Now, listen to me.

35:27.028 --> 35:29.130
I think it's Ray,
let me talk...

35:29.197 --> 35:31.132
Everybody stay
where the fuck they are.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.837
Jesus Christ, I forgot
what a mediocre place this was.

35:35.903 --> 35:37.104
- Ray.
- Professor.

35:37.171 --> 35:39.140
Whatever he's done,
I can sort this out for you.

35:40.674 --> 35:41.909
Elliot!

35:41.976 --> 35:43.244
Are you going somewhere, Jimmy?

35:43.311 --> 35:44.312
- Hey, don't touch her.
- Hey, don't... don't touch me.

35:44.377 --> 35:45.179
'Cause I'm pretty sure we agreed
to meet

35:45.246 --> 35:47.215
under a different circumstance.

35:47.281 --> 35:48.249
Ray, I can fucking explain this,
okay?

35:48.316 --> 35:49.382
Please explain to me
when you decided

35:49.449 --> 35:51.819
to rip me off
right before my fuckin' eyes.

35:51.886 --> 35:52.854
I didn't rip you off!

35:52.920 --> 35:54.554
Oh, then why did I get a call
from Sal

35:54.621 --> 35:56.123
that you left your apartment?

35:56.190 --> 35:57.524
That you took off
with the diamonds

35:57.591 --> 35:59.026
like they're yours.

35:59.093 --> 36:01.062
They're not even fuckin' mine,
Jimmy!

36:01.128 --> 36:03.563
Ray, I know this sounds
like bullshit,

36:03.630 --> 36:05.099
but they were stolen from me.

36:05.166 --> 36:05.699
Oh!

36:05.766 --> 36:07.601
Leave him alone!

36:07.667 --> 36:08.568
Please, no.

36:10.137 --> 36:11.371
I had the diamonds, okay?

36:11.438 --> 36:14.608
I was working on it
and someone broke into my place.

36:14.674 --> 36:15.843
These guys were
watching your place

36:15.910 --> 36:17.577
the whole time, Jimmy.

36:17.644 --> 36:19.881
And not because
I don't trust you,

36:19.947 --> 36:23.851
but because this is a very big
fuckin' deal we're doin' here.

36:23.918 --> 36:27.121
And they didn't see anybody
break in.

36:27.188 --> 36:30.124
I offered you 100 grand, James.

36:30.191 --> 36:31.591
100 fuckin' grand,

36:31.658 --> 36:33.828
because I wanted
to do right by you,

36:33.895 --> 36:34.896
because I trusted you.

36:34.962 --> 36:36.063
You can trust me.

36:36.130 --> 36:37.098
I thought you said
you saw this workin' out.

36:37.164 --> 36:39.599
- I did.
- That you saw the handoff.

36:39.666 --> 36:41.102
- I did.
- Then what the fuck happened?

36:41.168 --> 36:42.136
I don't know!

36:52.079 --> 36:53.948
- You know what I think?
- No!

36:54.015 --> 36:55.049
I think you fuckin' lied to me

36:55.116 --> 36:56.616
right from the very
fuckin' beginning.

36:56.683 --> 36:58.219
No, please, don't!

36:59.452 --> 37:02.555
I'm a dead man
without those stones, Jimmy.

37:02.622 --> 37:04.624
You understand me?

37:04.691 --> 37:06.794
Brains-on-the-fuckin'-wall dead.

37:08.296 --> 37:10.097
Just tell me where they are.

37:10.164 --> 37:13.034
Tell me where you hid them
and this will all be over.

37:13.100 --> 37:14.534
He's telling you the truth.

37:22.676 --> 37:24.045
Take Jimmy and the professor
downstairs.

37:25.578 --> 37:26.479
Lock 'em up in the basement.

37:26.546 --> 37:27.815
Let's go.

37:28.950 --> 37:31.919
Let's see
what the princess has to say.

37:32.987 --> 37:34.188
Move.

37:37.058 --> 37:39.927
I know what the fuck
you think you're doin',

37:39.994 --> 37:42.997
but you try anything
or say another fuckin' word,

37:43.064 --> 37:44.165
I'll personally kill you.

37:44.231 --> 37:45.900
- What're you talkin' about?
- Understand me?

37:45.967 --> 37:47.467
I know you have 'em.

37:52.373 --> 37:55.176
What's this all about?

37:55.242 --> 37:56.844
You need money?

37:56.911 --> 37:57.544
Is that it?

38:02.984 --> 38:07.321
You know, I got a daughter
about your age.

38:07.388 --> 38:12.193
She won't talk to me anymore,
but...

38:13.327 --> 38:15.196
See the way I see this is...

38:15.262 --> 38:18.565
Well, my Jimmy's never acted
like this before, ever,

38:18.631 --> 38:19.834
and then you come along and...

38:19.900 --> 38:21.168
You think I put him up to this?

38:21.235 --> 38:23.104
Well, you're the only variable,
honey.

38:23.170 --> 38:24.705
They're secure.

38:24.772 --> 38:26.273
Alright, check the house.

38:26.340 --> 38:28.142
Check the whole fuckin' house.

38:28.209 --> 38:29.744
I'll check upstairs.

38:31.045 --> 38:32.046
Elliot.

38:35.316 --> 38:36.884
What... what happened?

38:38.319 --> 38:39.954
Where's Angela?

38:41.088 --> 38:42.289
They got her upstairs.

38:42.356 --> 38:43.824
What?

38:43.891 --> 38:47.094
No, she's not safe up there.

38:47.161 --> 38:49.730
What the fuck was that?

38:49.797 --> 38:50.731
You got somebody out there?

38:50.798 --> 38:52.967
Terry, check it out!

38:53.034 --> 38:53.968
Come on, let's go.

38:54.969 --> 38:57.104
Jimmy!

38:57.171 --> 38:58.739
Who the fuck is out there?

39:02.410 --> 39:04.979
Ray,
I've told you everything I know!

39:05.046 --> 39:07.381
Well, you better start
using that head of yours, Jimmy,

39:07.448 --> 39:11.085
'cause I'm losin'
my fuckin' patience here.

39:11.152 --> 39:12.286
What the fuck!

39:12.353 --> 39:13.988
Jesus fucking Christ!

39:14.055 --> 39:15.256
Jimmy, I swear to God!

39:16.390 --> 39:17.624
Who's out there, Jimmy?

39:17.690 --> 39:20.294
I have no idea, Ray.

39:20.361 --> 39:21.295
Well, someone's out there.

39:23.831 --> 39:25.766
Ray,
I wouldn't fuck you over, man.

39:25.833 --> 39:26.633
Come on!

39:26.699 --> 39:28.769
I'm not deaf, Jimmy.

39:28.836 --> 39:30.304
I can hear what's goin' on.

39:30.371 --> 39:32.206
Who's out there?

39:32.273 --> 39:33.673
Hey, don't move!

39:33.741 --> 39:36.343
Ray, leave her alone!

39:37.778 --> 39:42.049
I don't have the
fucking diamonds, I swear!

39:44.885 --> 39:46.253
Jesus Christ!

39:46.320 --> 39:48.322
What the fuck
are you doin' out there?

39:48.389 --> 39:50.191
It's the fuckin' Zimbabwean.

39:50.257 --> 39:51.658
- Jimmy!
- Ray!

39:51.725 --> 39:53.294
I told you everything I know.

39:53.360 --> 39:55.296
I swear...

39:55.362 --> 39:56.764
Oh, what the fuck?

39:56.831 --> 39:58.332
She has nothing to do with this.

40:29.330 --> 40:31.165
Jimmy.

40:37.071 --> 40:38.472
Sorry, kiddo.

40:40.274 --> 40:42.443
I wish I had time
to explain this all to you.

40:45.012 --> 40:47.047
But it'll all make sense again.

40:48.549 --> 40:49.783
Please, God.

40:49.850 --> 40:51.118
It'll all make sense.

41:52.846 --> 41:53.914
<i>Good evening.</i>

42:26.647 --> 42:27.414
Where is everyone?

42:36.523 --> 42:38.158
You?

42:38.225 --> 42:42.363
Elliot?

42:42.429 --> 42:44.398
What happened to your beard?

43:04.051 --> 43:05.085
Elliot.

43:05.853 --> 43:06.487
Easy now.

43:13.060 --> 43:15.596
Did you drug me?

43:16.630 --> 43:18.265
How did you get this now?

43:18.332 --> 43:21.235
You... you injected me.

43:21.302 --> 43:23.604
I never told you
what the serum was?

43:23.671 --> 43:27.007
What?

43:27.074 --> 43:28.375
This is gonna be...

43:28.442 --> 43:29.643
Hard to understand.

43:29.711 --> 43:31.278
Elliot.

43:32.413 --> 43:36.150
The serum in that syringe was...

43:36.216 --> 43:38.285
What?

43:38.352 --> 43:41.155
Are you sure you aren't part
of some human-trans?

43:41.221 --> 43:42.389
Human-trans?

43:42.456 --> 43:47.461
What are you talking about?

43:47.528 --> 43:49.330
It's a time-travel agent.

43:52.966 --> 43:55.302
And it wasn't supposed
to be like this.

43:55.369 --> 44:00.307
Any of it.

44:00.374 --> 44:01.975
Well, clearly,
you've injected me

44:02.042 --> 44:05.312
with some really
great, great drugs.

44:05.379 --> 44:06.313
Look.

44:09.383 --> 44:10.150
Here.

44:11.720 --> 44:13.620
Read this.

44:20.094 --> 44:22.329
October 12th, 1994.

44:22.396 --> 44:26.333
I'm not messing with
you, I would not do that.

44:26.400 --> 44:28.635
Maybe it's time
you learned the truth

44:28.703 --> 44:30.237
about your condition.

44:33.440 --> 44:35.676
For years, quantum physicists
had spoken of ways

44:35.744 --> 44:38.078
of building a time machine.

44:38.145 --> 44:40.681
Negative energy, density
was always a key component,

44:40.749 --> 44:44.218
but we found a means
of isolating this energy

44:44.284 --> 44:47.488
and ultimately liquefying it.

44:47.554 --> 44:51.592
Now, meet Schrdinger,
our very first test subject.

44:51.658 --> 44:55.095
We injected this serum
into this brave little traveler

44:55.162 --> 44:58.599
which went directly
to his amygdala.

44:58.665 --> 44:59.633
The results...

45:00.702 --> 45:03.971
Well...

45:06.140 --> 45:09.009
What just happened?

45:09.076 --> 45:11.578
The Einstein-Rosen effect.

45:11.645 --> 45:14.248
An unhinging of space from time.

45:14.314 --> 45:16.350
The serum was the mode
of the brain

45:16.417 --> 45:19.520
and its memory
construct the driver.

45:19.586 --> 45:22.556
We thought we detached him
from temporality itself,

45:22.623 --> 45:25.459
but Schrdinger came back.

45:25.526 --> 45:26.728
And when he did,

45:26.795 --> 45:29.363
something incredible
had changed.

45:29.430 --> 45:30.998
At first, we just thought
he was showing signs

45:31.064 --> 45:32.399
of mental fatigue,
but it was more than that.

45:32.466 --> 45:35.402
You see, Schrdinger had
developed a knack

45:35.469 --> 45:38.272
for knowing
when his next experiment was.

45:38.338 --> 45:40.007
Our tests showed
that his brain lit up

45:40.073 --> 45:43.210
before an event even occurred.

45:43.277 --> 45:44.511
Schrdinger had developed...

45:44.578 --> 45:47.548
Clairvoyance.

45:47.614 --> 45:49.082
Sound familiar?

45:50.752 --> 45:53.020
Elliot.

45:53.086 --> 45:54.688
What are you doin' up, kiddo?

45:54.756 --> 45:56.623
I can't sleep.

45:56.690 --> 46:00.728
Come on, Jimbo, time for bed.

46:00.795 --> 46:03.163
You having bad dreams?

46:03.230 --> 46:04.498
I figure this life is...

46:08.235 --> 46:09.970
Let's go, okay?

46:14.508 --> 46:15.609
You alright?

46:15.676 --> 46:18.045
He was in my dream.

46:18.111 --> 46:21.315
The man downstairs?

46:21.381 --> 46:23.116
It's okay.

46:23.183 --> 46:28.055
Just remember the present
is where we live, right?

46:28.121 --> 46:29.556
Each moment counts.

46:54.214 --> 46:57.719
So I'm like your rat.

46:57.785 --> 46:59.686
I'm sorry you're only
finding out about this now

46:59.754 --> 47:01.221
and I...

47:01.288 --> 47:03.657
I know it's a lot to take in.

47:03.725 --> 47:06.093
You just needed a test subject.

47:06.159 --> 47:07.694
You scoured foster homes?

47:07.762 --> 47:10.230
Scoured foster homes?

47:10.297 --> 47:14.668
James, you sent me to find you.

47:14.736 --> 47:16.203
Why don't I remember that?

47:19.172 --> 47:20.641
Well, maybe...

47:24.611 --> 47:26.213
Maybe because it hasn't
happened yet.

47:26.280 --> 47:27.815
Why didn't you tell me?

47:27.882 --> 47:30.250
I don't know.

47:30.317 --> 47:32.119
I don't know why I ever
involved you in this,

47:32.185 --> 47:34.521
I don't even know when.

47:34.588 --> 47:37.124
But I have to believe there was
a good reason.

47:37.190 --> 47:41.128
Good reason?

47:41.194 --> 47:43.263
That little boy,

47:43.330 --> 47:46.834
he's seeing snippets
of my experiences

47:46.901 --> 47:50.738
and they become his future.

47:50.805 --> 47:53.640
Yes.

47:53.708 --> 47:55.409
A particle, split into two,

47:55.475 --> 47:58.278
no matter how it's pieces
are separated,

47:58.345 --> 48:00.915
will always melt and combine.

48:00.982 --> 48:03.684
Everything that child sees
and does

48:03.751 --> 48:08.155
is because you've done it.

48:08.221 --> 48:10.858
Then everything is fated.

48:10.925 --> 48:12.693
Well, that's my
working hypothesis, yes.

48:12.760 --> 48:14.729
You told me for years
that things aren't.

48:14.796 --> 48:15.964
I did.

48:16.030 --> 48:17.598
You drilled it into
me, my choices!

48:17.664 --> 48:19.399
Who I associated with.

48:19.466 --> 48:22.302
You said I just needed to try,
that nothing was fixed

48:22.369 --> 48:27.574
unless I let it be.

48:27.641 --> 48:29.376
But something did change.

48:32.312 --> 48:33.580
James.

48:41.254 --> 48:43.523
This was supposed to be
my dead body.

48:43.590 --> 48:45.258
I saw it
just like I see everything,

48:45.325 --> 48:46.693
but it didn't happen.

48:46.761 --> 48:48.595
She's the one who got shot.

48:48.662 --> 48:49.897
- Who's she?
- Angela.

48:49.964 --> 48:54.201
She's...
somehow Angela changed it.

48:54.267 --> 48:55.636
You were never shot.

49:00.942 --> 49:01.575
How does it work?

49:01.642 --> 49:02.810
The... the mechanism?

49:02.877 --> 49:05.412
How does it know to send me here
or to the future?

49:05.479 --> 49:06.914
Oh, you can't go to the future.

49:06.981 --> 49:09.383
You can only in theory go
to the past,

49:09.449 --> 49:10.852
events
that the amygdala recalls,

49:10.918 --> 49:12.386
events
that have emotional weight.

49:12.452 --> 49:14.488
But this event
where she gets shot,

49:14.554 --> 49:19.292
it's in your future,
but it's my past.

49:19.359 --> 49:21.595
Elliot, you always said
that if I tried hard enough

49:21.662 --> 49:23.363
I could change my fate.

49:23.430 --> 49:26.233
Maybe this is where I do it.

49:26.299 --> 49:27.300
Stop her from getting killed

49:27.367 --> 49:29.336
or stop myself from saying "yes"
to Ray.

49:29.403 --> 49:31.605
It's possible but I...

49:31.672 --> 49:34.942
Elliot, I gotta try.

49:35.009 --> 49:37.377
That boy up there,

49:37.444 --> 49:40.247
he couldn't do anything
to save his mom.

49:40.313 --> 49:41.916
To save my mom.

49:41.983 --> 49:46.286
All because
he got scared, paralyzed.

49:46.353 --> 49:47.989
I can't let that happen again.

49:48.056 --> 49:51.658
Not to her.

49:51.726 --> 49:54.594
I have to help her.

49:54.661 --> 49:56.898
Inject me again.

49:56.964 --> 49:58.265
The mind is the driver.

49:58.331 --> 50:01.803
You have to think and feel
about where you want to go.

50:01.869 --> 50:04.271
Do you have something specific?

50:04.337 --> 50:05.840
Yeah.

50:05.907 --> 50:06.841
Good.

50:06.908 --> 50:08.910
And just
one small dose per travel.

50:08.976 --> 50:10.677
Don't overdo it.

50:10.745 --> 50:14.749
Now, you remember,
stay present

50:14.816 --> 50:19.519
and you'll be perfectly safe.

50:19.586 --> 50:21.055
Now,
focus on where you wanna go.

50:22.757 --> 50:24.759
Feel it.

50:24.826 --> 50:26.593
Let your memory do the rest.

50:36.636 --> 50:40.407
You'll have to avoid
your other self at all costs.

50:40.474 --> 50:42.944
Your mind... the driver...

50:43.010 --> 50:45.679
Don't overdo it.

50:51.052 --> 50:53.320
Shit!

51:05.398 --> 51:08.770
And we're back.

51:08.836 --> 51:10.805
Let's get those diamonds.

51:20.614 --> 51:21.816
Oh!

51:28.588 --> 51:29.824
Time's up, asshole.

51:29.891 --> 51:31.358
Jesus Christ.

51:31.424 --> 51:33.027
Ben.
Ben, what the fuck?

51:33.094 --> 51:33.861
Look at my face, James.

51:33.928 --> 51:35.495
Do I look like a babysitter?

51:35.562 --> 51:37.098
I have your money, okay?

51:39.133 --> 51:40.067
Were you holdin' out on me?

51:40.134 --> 51:42.036
I was goin' to come by today,
okay?

51:42.103 --> 51:45.907
1, 2, th...

51:45.973 --> 51:48.075
- Angela.
- Oh, oh, whoa.

51:48.142 --> 51:49.376
Where you going, man?

51:50.577 --> 51:53.114
Okay, okay,
3, 4, 5, 6, keep the change.

51:53.181 --> 51:55.382
Happy?
Okay.

51:57.218 --> 51:58.585
That's not
how it's gonna work, James.

51:58.652 --> 52:00.353
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I got your money.

52:02.890 --> 52:03.958
- Hey.
- Hi.

52:05.126 --> 52:06.260
You wanna stay here?

52:06.326 --> 52:08.863
I'm gonna need an advance
in next month's rent.

52:08.930 --> 52:10.932
You gotta be kidding me.

52:13.100 --> 52:15.069
Stop fucking me, you know what?

52:15.136 --> 52:16.103
There, happy?

52:17.905 --> 52:18.906
Yeah, well,

52:18.973 --> 52:20.640
you bring this shit on yourself,
James.

52:28.983 --> 52:30.117
Oh, where are my keys?

52:37.657 --> 52:38.759
What about you?

52:38.826 --> 52:40.027
Your parents around?

52:40.094 --> 52:42.797
No.

52:42.864 --> 52:44.564
Anyways, I... I...

52:44.631 --> 52:48.836
I figure this life is up to me.

52:48.903 --> 52:52.472
Well, someday all that you see
could be yours.

53:07.621 --> 53:11.859
Uh, you mentioned somethin'
about Sea Breeze body wash.

53:11.926 --> 53:12.793
Right.

53:12.860 --> 53:14.829
Okay.

53:14.896 --> 53:15.963
Watch your beer.

53:16.030 --> 53:17.031
Shit.

53:18.698 --> 53:20.001
Hey, don't worry.

53:20.067 --> 53:20.935
I got it.

53:26.107 --> 53:27.174
Careful.

53:27.241 --> 53:28.541
Okay.

53:30.144 --> 53:31.178
Yeah, that's what you think.

53:40.154 --> 53:42.089
- Uh, towel?
- Yeah.

53:44.025 --> 53:44.926
Towel's under the sink.

53:44.992 --> 53:46.127
You know
about the God-awful mess.

53:55.736 --> 53:59.040
What about him saying
that he saw the handoff?

53:59.106 --> 54:00.841
You know,
how many things are in that guy's head,

54:00.908 --> 54:02.542
who knows what he saw?

54:02.609 --> 54:05.545
Maybe he saw it handed to you.

54:05.612 --> 54:08.149
Now, I'm gonna be right here,
engine running.

54:08.215 --> 54:11.285
You get in, take the bag,
get the fuck out, nothing more.

54:11.352 --> 54:12.186
Okay?
No blood.

54:12.253 --> 54:15.990
- Yeah, sure.
- Hey, no blood.

56:03.831 --> 56:05.166
We gotta go.

56:05.232 --> 56:06.699
Come on.

56:10.938 --> 56:13.040
James, what...

56:13.107 --> 56:14.641
Don't get freaked out,

56:14.708 --> 56:16.277
but there is someone
in my apartment.

56:16.343 --> 56:17.178
- What?
- Just come on, come on.

56:17.244 --> 56:18.312
Jesus!

56:18.379 --> 56:19.914
On the upper ground.

56:19.980 --> 56:20.613
Go, go, go.

56:20.680 --> 56:22.883
Go on, go on, please.

56:27.054 --> 56:28.856
Come on, come on, hurry,
we gotta go.

56:33.761 --> 56:35.896
Please.

56:35.963 --> 56:37.198
- Open the door!
- What is happening?

56:37.264 --> 56:38.132
Just... just...

56:38.199 --> 56:40.835
Open the fuckin' door!

56:40.901 --> 56:41.769
- You hear that?
- Just...

56:55.049 --> 56:56.016
Hey!

56:59.286 --> 57:00.687
Oh fuck!

57:00.754 --> 57:02.689
Ugh, dammit.

57:03.757 --> 57:04.492
Jesus, was that a gunshot?

57:04.558 --> 57:07.128
Just keep going.

57:07.194 --> 57:07.928
Hey!

57:07.995 --> 57:10.397
Hey, stop!

57:10.464 --> 57:11.332
Just run.

57:11.398 --> 57:12.867
There's a ladder
around the back.

57:15.169 --> 57:17.371
- Fuck you, Sal!
- Jimmy.

57:17.438 --> 57:17.938
He's runnin', Sal.

57:18.005 --> 57:19.140
He's runnin'!

57:26.914 --> 57:27.982
Jesus, Sal!
What is this?

57:28.048 --> 57:30.084
- Hey!
- What are you doing?

57:30.151 --> 57:32.386
Fuck did I tell you?

57:32.453 --> 57:33.554
Sorry about that, kid.

57:33.621 --> 57:35.389
Uh, listen,
there's been a change of plans.

57:35.456 --> 57:36.557
Uh, Ray and I, we spoke.

57:36.624 --> 57:39.426
He wants us to hang on
to the diamonds now.

57:39.493 --> 57:41.462
Ray, doesn't change plans, Sal.

57:41.529 --> 57:45.399
We're just gonna come
around, nobody has to get hurt.

57:45.466 --> 57:46.901
What the fuck?

57:58.279 --> 57:59.113
Go, go, go, go!

58:00.781 --> 58:04.785
Head to the freeway.

58:04.852 --> 58:07.454
Hey, is that that fuckin' chick?

58:07.521 --> 58:09.890
How the hell did he get there?

58:18.065 --> 58:20.234
Hey, where did he come from?

58:24.271 --> 58:25.539
Oh!

58:25.606 --> 58:27.374
I'm so sorry.

58:30.110 --> 58:33.080
I can't imagine what that
would have done to a kid.

58:38.118 --> 58:40.387
Okay, getting the diamonds,
give 'em to Ray.

58:42.990 --> 58:46.260
And this will all be over.

58:49.563 --> 58:51.031
You gotta be kidding me.

58:51.098 --> 58:52.233
You're looking for this?

59:03.644 --> 59:06.480
What the fuck
are you guys doing?

59:08.115 --> 59:09.383
Where are the diamonds, James?

59:10.484 --> 59:12.119
Goin' back to Rays.

59:12.186 --> 59:12.920
Fuck Ray.

59:12.987 --> 59:15.322
Hey, keep your mouth shut.

59:17.291 --> 59:18.993
You're fuckin' him off,
aren't you?

59:19.059 --> 59:20.227
You don't know
what you're talkin' about.

59:22.963 --> 59:24.498
Like I said
it's a change of plans.

59:24.565 --> 59:26.200
Ray doesn't change plans.

59:26.267 --> 59:27.601
What the fuck do you know
about Ray?

59:27.668 --> 59:29.370
You think you know how
that guy works?

59:29.436 --> 59:30.471
He's my cousin

59:30.537 --> 59:33.073
and I don't even know how
that guy works.

59:33.140 --> 59:35.409
You know, what it's like losin'
four years of your life?

59:35.476 --> 59:36.844
Hmm?

59:36.910 --> 59:39.413
I'm the one who got fucked over.

59:39.480 --> 59:41.615
So I need those stones, James.

59:41.682 --> 59:44.118
It's not gonna give me
my time back.

59:44.184 --> 59:45.185
But it's a start.

59:45.252 --> 59:46.220
So you are...

59:47.988 --> 59:49.089
He's the rat.

59:52.993 --> 59:53.927
So you want
a little piece of it?

59:53.994 --> 59:55.229
Huh?

59:56.163 --> 59:58.465
What's it to you who pays you?

59:58.532 --> 59:59.734
I can't give you 100 grand
in cash,

59:59.800 --> 01:00:03.270
but I'll give you a lot more
than that in stones.

01:00:03.337 --> 01:00:04.938
What do you say, scumbag?

01:00:06.573 --> 01:00:09.109
He kills her.

01:00:09.176 --> 01:00:11.278
He kills Angela.

01:00:11.345 --> 01:00:13.013
And I'm not
gonna let that happen.

01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:14.515
That girl from the street?

01:00:14.581 --> 01:00:16.250
That's not our fuckin' problem.

01:00:16.317 --> 01:00:19.353
Hey, can you just let me
fucking do this?

01:00:22.189 --> 01:00:22.956
I'm gonna help her, Sal.

01:00:24.726 --> 01:00:26.493
I'm taking those
stones back to Ray.

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:27.528
Uh-uh, I'm afraid...

01:00:27.594 --> 01:00:28.262
And you're not gonna
fucking stop me.

01:00:28.329 --> 01:00:29.263
No, no, no.

01:00:29.330 --> 01:00:32.966
I'm afraid
I can't let that happen.

01:00:33.033 --> 01:00:35.169
Move.

01:00:38.505 --> 01:00:41.041
I said "move".

01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:48.148
Oh!

01:00:55.622 --> 01:00:58.092
Jimmy, unlock it.

01:00:58.158 --> 01:01:00.060
Come on.

01:01:00.127 --> 01:01:01.595
Dingo was his name-o.

01:01:01.662 --> 01:01:02.930
Unlock it.

01:01:02.996 --> 01:01:04.298
Let's go unlock it.

01:01:04.365 --> 01:01:06.066
Jimmy, unlock it.

01:01:08.770 --> 01:01:10.337
Unlock it.

01:01:12.673 --> 01:01:14.308
I can't control
what this guy does.

01:01:14.375 --> 01:01:15.943
Trust me, I've tried.

01:01:16.009 --> 01:01:19.079
I'm not even gonna look.

01:01:19.146 --> 01:01:20.981
Let me kill him, Sal.

01:01:21.048 --> 01:01:22.316
Let me put a bullet in his brain

01:01:22.383 --> 01:01:25.419
and let me kill
this motherfucker.

01:01:25.486 --> 01:01:27.087
Just give me the word.

01:01:27.154 --> 01:01:29.423
Tell me I can kill him, Sal!

01:01:29.490 --> 01:01:30.557
Alright!

01:01:32.226 --> 01:01:33.427
Alright, alright.

01:01:33.494 --> 01:01:34.261
Alright.

01:01:49.643 --> 01:01:52.479
Dingo was his name-o.

01:01:52.546 --> 01:01:53.013
Terry, watch out!

01:01:54.381 --> 01:01:55.616
Oh!

01:01:55.682 --> 01:01:56.517
Oh!

01:01:56.583 --> 01:01:57.985
Shit, you motherfucker.

01:02:02.689 --> 01:02:03.524
Fuckin', you're a dead man, man.

01:02:03.590 --> 01:02:04.258
Don't fuckin' move.

01:02:04.324 --> 01:02:05.125
Don't you fuckin' move.

01:02:05.192 --> 01:02:07.327
You're a dead man, you punk.

01:02:07.394 --> 01:02:08.429
You fucking rat.

01:02:15.436 --> 01:02:16.470
Come on, get up.

01:02:16.537 --> 01:02:17.104
Come on, let's go.

01:02:17.171 --> 01:02:18.172
You gotta get up.

01:02:22.609 --> 01:02:26.046
Oh shit!

01:02:26.113 --> 01:02:28.382
Wait a second, isn't...

01:02:28.449 --> 01:02:30.517
Isn't Ray the other way?

01:02:30.584 --> 01:02:33.220
I think I know where he's goin'.

01:02:33.287 --> 01:02:36.557
You gotta call Ray
before that motherfucker talks.

01:02:36.623 --> 01:02:37.725
Or it's over.

01:03:02.382 --> 01:03:03.383
Who's this?

01:03:03.450 --> 01:03:05.385
He took off.

01:03:05.452 --> 01:03:06.186
What did you say?

01:03:06.253 --> 01:03:07.621
With the fuckin' diamonds.

01:03:07.688 --> 01:03:09.289
I thought you were supposed
to be keepin' an eye out on him.

01:03:09.356 --> 01:03:11.291
<i>Oh, we did!</i>
He... he ran off.

01:03:11.358 --> 01:03:12.192
He ran off
with some chick he met.

01:03:12.259 --> 01:03:13.227
Ran from his fuckin' apartment.

01:03:13.293 --> 01:03:14.361
And you didn't think
to follow him?

01:03:14.428 --> 01:03:16.731
He surprised us, cuz.

01:03:16.798 --> 01:03:19.701
Look, he headed East,
I know that.

01:03:19.767 --> 01:03:22.669
He's probably heading
to that cardigan-wearing motherfucker.

01:03:22.737 --> 01:03:24.238
Okay, where are you?

01:04:05.947 --> 01:04:07.180
Elliot!

01:04:09.182 --> 01:04:11.151
Elliot, it's James.

01:04:19.794 --> 01:04:21.194
You and I have a lot
to talk about.

01:04:36.643 --> 01:04:39.279
I wanted to tell you.

01:04:39.346 --> 01:04:43.150
I wanted to tell you every day.

01:04:43.216 --> 01:04:46.653
But?

01:04:46.721 --> 01:04:50.424
But I was hoping that
somehow things would change,

01:04:50.490 --> 01:04:53.460
that you'd fixed everything
that needed to be fixed,

01:04:53.527 --> 01:04:56.597
that you... you would avoid
all that led up to...

01:05:01.501 --> 01:05:03.270
Did you end up saving her?

01:05:03.337 --> 01:05:05.272
I don't know yet.

01:05:05.339 --> 01:05:06.874
This isn't even my present.

01:05:06.941 --> 01:05:08.141
What?

01:05:08.208 --> 01:05:11.645
I mean it is my present,
but I'm still in the past.

01:05:11.713 --> 01:05:13.380
Still in the past?

01:05:13.447 --> 01:05:16.550
I'm still traveling
and this has already happened.

01:05:16.617 --> 01:05:18.786
At least, for me.

01:05:20.822 --> 01:05:24.892
Listen, there's another me.

01:05:24.959 --> 01:05:27.294
He doesn't know
about any of this,

01:05:27.361 --> 01:05:28.662
but he's about to come over here
telling you

01:05:28.730 --> 01:05:33.200
how he saw his own death,
unless his vision has changed.

01:05:33.266 --> 01:05:34.434
His own death.

01:05:34.501 --> 01:05:37.671
But it doesn't happen to him,
it happens to her.

01:05:37.739 --> 01:05:38.706
So once Ray shows up...

01:05:38.773 --> 01:05:40.207
Ray?

01:05:40.273 --> 01:05:41.876
- He shows up?
- Yeah.

01:05:41.943 --> 01:05:42.877
Here?

01:05:42.944 --> 01:05:44.846
Why?

01:05:44.912 --> 01:05:45.980
These.

01:05:46.047 --> 01:05:47.247
These are his diamonds.

01:05:47.314 --> 01:05:48.548
This is all that he wants.

01:05:48.615 --> 01:05:52.920
So once he shows up,
you let him know you have these

01:05:52.987 --> 01:05:54.554
and this will all go away.

01:05:58.026 --> 01:06:00.227
What?

01:06:00.293 --> 01:06:03.731
Such a mess.

01:06:03.798 --> 01:06:05.499
It's my mess.

01:06:05.565 --> 01:06:06.868
I'm the one
who caused your affliction

01:06:06.934 --> 01:06:11.739
and even now I don't know when
or why.

01:06:11.806 --> 01:06:13.240
You did the best you could.

01:06:24.551 --> 01:06:25.753
- They're here.
- Who?

01:06:26.653 --> 01:06:27.922
The earlier me.

01:06:27.989 --> 01:06:28.990
Oh shit.

01:06:29.057 --> 01:06:30.058
Okay, I'm hiding these
under your bed.

01:06:30.124 --> 01:06:32.659
Remember,
give 'em to Ray right away.

01:06:32.727 --> 01:06:33.660
What are you gonna do?

01:06:33.728 --> 01:06:34.661
You can't be
with your other self?

01:06:34.729 --> 01:06:35.362
I'll stay far away.

01:06:35.429 --> 01:06:37.197
Just play your part.

01:06:41.069 --> 01:06:43.570
Yeah, yeah.

01:06:43.637 --> 01:06:44.604
I'm coming.

01:06:47.875 --> 01:06:48.776
Hey.

01:06:51.445 --> 01:06:52.279
It's been a while.

01:06:52.345 --> 01:06:53.547
How you doin'?

01:06:53.613 --> 01:06:54.314
Alright.

01:06:54.381 --> 01:06:55.817
Just alright?

01:06:55.883 --> 01:06:57.551
Yeah.

01:06:57.617 --> 01:06:58.552
Well, you can cut the bullshit,

01:06:58.618 --> 01:07:01.288
'cause I can see it
on your face.

01:07:01.354 --> 01:07:02.355
Tell him.

01:07:04.357 --> 01:07:05.760
I saw my death.

01:07:07.762 --> 01:07:09.696
What?

01:07:09.764 --> 01:07:12.699
How did this happen?

01:07:12.767 --> 01:07:14.902
- Ray asked me to...
- I warned you, didn't I?

01:07:14.969 --> 01:07:16.738
Elliot.

01:07:16.804 --> 01:07:17.939
He's a criminal, James.

01:07:18.005 --> 01:07:18.973
I had no choice,
I needed to work...

01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:21.308
Of course, you had a choice.

01:07:21.374 --> 01:07:23.343
It's not what I saw.

01:07:23.410 --> 01:07:24.578
Oh, for God's sakes.

01:07:24.644 --> 01:07:25.747
Just because you see
ahead of you

01:07:25.813 --> 01:07:28.015
does not mean
that you're impotent to choose.

01:07:28.082 --> 01:07:29.884
That's a theory, Elliot.

01:07:29.951 --> 01:07:31.318
You know
that's not how it works.

01:07:31.384 --> 01:07:32.385
I know how you work.

01:07:32.452 --> 01:07:33.653
You see a future,
it's yours to steal,

01:07:33.721 --> 01:07:34.989
and you're gonna see a future
where you're a crook,

01:07:35.056 --> 01:07:38.525
but you start applying yourself,
and your future changes.

01:07:38.592 --> 01:07:40.427
One small dose per travel.

01:07:44.966 --> 01:07:46.366
There's another me.

01:07:46.433 --> 01:07:47.702
He doesn't know
about any of us.

01:07:49.971 --> 01:07:51.338
He's about to come
over here and tell you

01:07:51.404 --> 01:07:52.472
how he saw his own death.

01:07:52.539 --> 01:07:54.374
His own death.

01:07:54.441 --> 01:07:56.343
I've always been a part of this.

01:07:56.409 --> 01:07:59.080
Can I tell you something?

01:07:59.147 --> 01:08:02.083
This is gonna sound weird,
but I won...

01:08:02.150 --> 01:08:03.450
That's her car.

01:08:03.517 --> 01:08:04.451
That's him.

01:08:04.518 --> 01:08:05.519
I'm not gonna accept that.

01:08:05.585 --> 01:08:09.422
We have to try.
We have to at least try.

01:08:09.489 --> 01:08:10.624
- Angela.
- We have to at least try.

01:08:10.690 --> 01:08:13.027
Professor, let's
go, open the door!

01:08:13.094 --> 01:08:14.494
Elliot.

01:08:14.561 --> 01:08:17.131
Elliot, we're gonna go.

01:08:17.198 --> 01:08:18.398
Listen to me.

01:08:18.465 --> 01:08:19.366
I think it's Ray.

01:08:19.432 --> 01:08:21.102
Let me talk...

01:08:21.169 --> 01:08:24.504
Everybody stay
where the fuck they are.

01:08:24.571 --> 01:08:27.640
Jesus Christ, I forgot
what a mediocre place this was.

01:08:27.707 --> 01:08:29.010
- Go, get the diamonds.
- Ray.

01:08:29.076 --> 01:08:30.044
Come on, Elliot.

01:08:30.111 --> 01:08:31.310
Professor.

01:08:31.377 --> 01:08:32.312
Whatever he's done,
I can sort this out for you.

01:08:32.379 --> 01:08:33.113
Hey!

01:08:33.180 --> 01:08:34.881
Elliot!

01:08:34.948 --> 01:08:35.750
No.

01:08:35.817 --> 01:08:36.448
Are you going somewhere, Jimmy?

01:08:36.515 --> 01:08:37.684
No, don't touch me.

01:08:37.752 --> 01:08:38.551
'Cause I'm pretty
sure we agreed to meet

01:08:38.618 --> 01:08:40.787
under different circumstances.

01:08:40.854 --> 01:08:41.688
Ray,
I can fucking explain this, okay?

01:08:41.756 --> 01:08:43.124
Please explain to me...

01:08:43.191 --> 01:08:44.024
When you decided to rip me off
right before my fuckin' eyes.

01:08:44.091 --> 01:08:46.426
I didn't rip you off!

01:08:46.493 --> 01:08:47.261
Oh,
then why did I get a call from Sal

01:08:47.327 --> 01:08:48.930
that you left your apartment?

01:08:58.604 --> 01:08:59.573
You fuckin' hearing me?

01:08:59.639 --> 01:09:01.776
- Sal.
- Hey, I know you have 'em.

01:09:01.843 --> 01:09:03.676
- What are you talkin' about?
- I know you have 'em.

01:09:03.743 --> 01:09:04.644
I'll fuck you up.

01:09:04.712 --> 01:09:05.947
You know,
what I'm talking about.

01:09:06.013 --> 01:09:08.916
Sal.

01:09:08.983 --> 01:09:12.118
Let's go.

01:09:12.185 --> 01:09:12.920
I don't know.

01:09:12.987 --> 01:09:14.654
Hey, hey.

01:09:14.721 --> 01:09:15.354
You think I put him up to this?

01:09:15.421 --> 01:09:16.590
Why are they talkin'?

01:09:16.656 --> 01:09:17.291
Well,
you're the only variable, honey.

01:09:17.357 --> 01:09:18.491
I don't fuckin' know.

01:09:18.558 --> 01:09:20.828
- What about his face?
- What about his face?

01:09:20.895 --> 01:09:23.496
I hit him
really fuckin' hard, man.

01:09:23.563 --> 01:09:25.564
You just focus on
what you need to focus on.

01:09:30.636 --> 01:09:32.173
They're secure.

01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:33.673
Alright, check the house.

01:09:33.741 --> 01:09:35.642
Check the whole fuckin' house.

01:09:35.710 --> 01:09:36.944
I'll check upstairs.

01:09:37.011 --> 01:09:40.014
Oh fuck, I can't see anything.

01:09:42.250 --> 01:09:43.850
What... what happened?

01:09:45.286 --> 01:09:46.921
Where's Angela?

01:09:46.988 --> 01:09:47.955
They got her upstairs.

01:09:48.022 --> 01:09:50.957
No, she's not safe up there.

01:09:51.024 --> 01:09:53.460
You gotta do something.

01:09:53.526 --> 01:09:54.594
I'm sorry, Ray.

01:09:58.165 --> 01:09:59.599
What the fuck was that?

01:09:59.666 --> 01:10:00.902
You got somebody out there?

01:10:00.968 --> 01:10:02.569
Terry, check it out!

01:10:02.636 --> 01:10:03.738
Come on, let's go.

01:10:05.907 --> 01:10:08.109
Jimmy!

01:10:08.175 --> 01:10:10.644
Who the fuck is out there?

01:10:10.711 --> 01:10:12.179
Ray,
I've told you everything I know!

01:10:12.246 --> 01:10:14.614
Well, you better start
using that head of yours, Jimmy,

01:10:14.681 --> 01:10:17.051
'cause I'm losin'
my fuckin' patience here.

01:10:20.121 --> 01:10:21.088
What the fuck!

01:10:21.155 --> 01:10:23.858
Jesus fucking Christ!

01:10:23.925 --> 01:10:26.060
Jimmy, I swear to God!

01:10:26.127 --> 01:10:27.194
Who's out there, Jimmy?

01:10:27.261 --> 01:10:29.730
I have no idea, Ray!

01:10:29.797 --> 01:10:31.631
Well, someone's out there.

01:10:31.698 --> 01:10:32.867
What are you guys tryin'
to pull here?

01:10:32.934 --> 01:10:34.902
Ray,
I wouldn't fuck you over, man.

01:10:34.969 --> 01:10:37.004
- Come on!
- I'm not deaf, Jimmy.

01:10:37.071 --> 01:10:38.538
I can hear what's goin' on.

01:10:38.605 --> 01:10:40.741
Who's out there?

01:10:40.808 --> 01:10:42.176
Hey, don't move!

01:10:42.243 --> 01:10:45.212
Ray, I don't have the
fucking diamonds, I swear!

01:10:51.719 --> 01:10:52.853
What's wrong?

01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:54.055
What the fuck are
you doin' out there?

01:10:58.092 --> 01:10:59.226
Jimmy!

01:10:59.293 --> 01:11:00.527
I'm sorry, Ray.

01:12:48.469 --> 01:12:49.403
Oh!

01:12:55.876 --> 01:12:57.411
Man,
I just need like a dollar for lunch.

01:13:03.918 --> 01:13:04.584
Oh!

01:13:04.651 --> 01:13:07.587
Watch yourself, cowboy.

01:13:46.026 --> 01:13:49.230
Shit that I grew up with.

01:13:49.296 --> 01:13:50.697
...is fated.

01:13:50.764 --> 01:13:54.468
I figure this life is up to me.

01:13:57.304 --> 01:13:58.072
There's still time.

01:13:59.473 --> 01:14:00.708
My choices!

01:14:00.774 --> 01:14:02.042
Who I associated with.

01:14:02.109 --> 01:14:05.412
You said I just needed to try,
that nothing was fixed.

01:14:05.479 --> 01:14:07.248
But something did change.

01:14:07.314 --> 01:14:08.849
She's the one who got shot.

01:14:08.916 --> 01:14:09.750
Who's she?

01:14:09.817 --> 01:14:10.451
Angela.

01:14:10.518 --> 01:14:13.053
She... she saved me.

01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:16.824
Cool place,
takin' that you live alone.

01:14:16.891 --> 01:14:18.225
Is it that obvious?

01:14:18.292 --> 01:14:20.861
It could use a woman's touch.

01:14:20.928 --> 01:14:22.163
I'll keep that in mind.

01:14:25.533 --> 01:14:27.902
I'm James.

01:14:27.968 --> 01:14:29.403
Angela.

01:14:29.470 --> 01:14:31.238
Okay, I meet her.

01:14:35.576 --> 01:14:37.912
Just get the
other me away from her.

01:14:43.317 --> 01:14:44.485
I have to help her.

01:14:44.552 --> 01:14:47.321
Maybe this is where I do it.

01:14:56.363 --> 01:14:57.064
Get off me!

01:14:57.131 --> 01:14:58.899
Hey, asshole.

01:14:58.966 --> 01:15:00.134
Get the fuck out of
here, fuckhead.

01:15:00.201 --> 01:15:01.769
Look, I don't wanna go
through the motions here,

01:15:01.835 --> 01:15:02.536
but let's get this over with,
huh?

01:15:02.603 --> 01:15:04.538
You hit me, I hit you.

01:15:04.605 --> 01:15:06.507
Mind your own fuckin' business.

01:15:06.574 --> 01:15:08.042
Believe me, man,
I would if I could.

01:15:08.108 --> 01:15:09.843
Come on.

01:15:09.910 --> 01:15:11.111
Are you fuckin' kidding me?

01:15:11.178 --> 01:15:13.314
This is kind of where you're
supposed to hit me.

01:15:18.485 --> 01:15:19.153
Get off me.

01:15:19.220 --> 01:15:20.521
Let's get out of here.

01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:29.063
Double-teaming me, huh?

01:15:29.129 --> 01:15:30.064
Oh!

01:16:02.896 --> 01:16:05.966
You really understand
how his ability works.

01:16:07.301 --> 01:16:09.069
Well,
it's more of an affliction, sadly.

01:16:09.136 --> 01:16:12.172
You make it
sound like a disease.

01:16:12.239 --> 01:16:13.173
Please.

01:16:14.441 --> 01:16:15.409
Excuse me a moment.

01:16:22.983 --> 01:16:24.318
What are you doing here?

01:16:24.385 --> 01:16:26.020
I thought you were
hiding the diamonds.

01:16:26.086 --> 01:16:27.554
That's an earlier me.

01:16:29.023 --> 01:16:29.857
Oh, watch it, easy!

01:16:31.292 --> 01:16:32.159
James.

01:16:35.062 --> 01:16:37.464
- What... what's happening?
- You're beginning to fragment.

01:16:37.531 --> 01:16:39.633
I tried to change it.

01:16:39.701 --> 01:16:41.135
It's all fixed.

01:16:41.201 --> 01:16:42.603
It's all fixed, all of it.

01:16:42.670 --> 01:16:44.038
What?

01:16:44.104 --> 01:16:46.240
She always dies.

01:16:46.307 --> 01:16:48.442
No matter what I try.

01:16:51.011 --> 01:16:51.612
I cause it.

01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:54.348
I always have.

01:16:54.415 --> 01:16:56.216
No, no, no, no, no,
listen to me, James.

01:16:56.283 --> 01:16:59.086
You're talking crap,
it's bullshit!

01:16:59.153 --> 01:17:00.521
I'll give the stones to Ray.

01:17:00.587 --> 01:17:02.423
You just gotta stay strong.

01:17:02.489 --> 01:17:04.158
Stay present.

01:17:04.224 --> 01:17:07.094
Okay, kiddo.

01:17:15.737 --> 01:17:17.204
That's her car.

01:17:17.271 --> 01:17:19.640
That's him.

01:17:19.708 --> 01:17:21.108
I can't believe this shit.

01:17:23.210 --> 01:17:26.280
Professor, let's go,
open the door!

01:17:32.219 --> 01:17:34.288
James, what's wrong?

01:17:36.123 --> 01:17:37.057
Why don't
we listen to the radio,

01:17:37.124 --> 01:17:39.693
hey, what do you wanna
listen to?

01:17:39.761 --> 01:17:42.996
I told mom
not to drive that night.

01:17:43.063 --> 01:17:44.898
Why didn't she listen?

01:17:51.605 --> 01:17:53.507
Maybe she did.

01:17:55.576 --> 01:17:59.279
Maybe in that very
moment all she could do

01:17:59.346 --> 01:18:02.383
was make a choice.

01:18:02.449 --> 01:18:09.089
And maybe your mom's choice,
even with your warning,

01:18:09.156 --> 01:18:13.293
was the most courageous thing
she could have done.

01:18:14.661 --> 01:18:21.435
Maybe she died,
so you could live.

01:18:24.739 --> 01:18:26.340
Are you listening to me?

01:18:31.612 --> 01:18:34.515
Life for a life.

01:18:39.788 --> 01:18:41.155
You know what I think?

01:18:41.221 --> 01:18:42.189
No!

01:18:42.256 --> 01:18:43.290
I think you fuckin' lied to me

01:18:43.357 --> 01:18:45.025
right from the very
fuckin' beginning.

01:18:45.092 --> 01:18:46.360
No, please, no!

01:18:46.427 --> 01:18:47.995
I'm a dead man without
those stones, Jimmy.

01:18:48.897 --> 01:18:51.098
You understand me?

01:18:51.165 --> 01:18:54.334
Brains-on-the-fuckin'-wall dead.

01:19:01.776 --> 01:19:04.077
He's telling you the truth.

01:19:11.786 --> 01:19:12.686
Where's Angela?

01:19:12.754 --> 01:19:14.288
They got her upstairs.

01:19:14.354 --> 01:19:15.622
No, she's not safe up there.

01:19:18.492 --> 01:19:19.526
They're secure.

01:19:19.593 --> 01:19:21.128
Check the house.

01:19:21.195 --> 01:19:22.730
Check the whole fuckin' house.

01:19:29.570 --> 01:19:30.738
What the fuck was that?

01:19:30.805 --> 01:19:31.438
You got somebody out there?

01:19:31.505 --> 01:19:33.240
Terry, check it out!

01:19:33.307 --> 01:19:35.576
Come on, let's go.

01:19:35.642 --> 01:19:36.310
Let's go.

01:19:36.376 --> 01:19:37.110
Jimmy!

01:19:37.177 --> 01:19:39.413
Who the fuck is out there?

01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:40.949
Ray,
I've told you everything I know!

01:19:41.014 --> 01:19:43.484
Well, you better start
using that head of yours, Jimmy,

01:19:43.550 --> 01:19:46.487
'cause I'm losin'
my fuckin' patience here.

01:19:52.659 --> 01:19:53.627
Jesus fucking Christ!

01:19:53.694 --> 01:19:55.362
Jimmy, I swear to God!

01:19:56.296 --> 01:19:57.097
Ray, listen to me.

01:19:57.164 --> 01:19:59.466
She has nothing to do with this.

01:19:59.533 --> 01:20:01.435
Well, someone's out there.

01:20:01.502 --> 01:20:03.604
What are you guys tryin'
to pull here?

01:20:03.670 --> 01:20:05.606
Ray,
I wouldn't fuck you over, man.

01:20:05.672 --> 01:20:06.473
Come on!

01:20:06.540 --> 01:20:07.307
I'm not deaf, Jimmy.

01:20:07.374 --> 01:20:09.343
I can hear what's goin' on.

01:20:09.409 --> 01:20:12.412
Who's out there?

01:20:21.321 --> 01:20:21.789
Oh!

01:20:25.192 --> 01:20:26.627
Hey, don't move!

01:20:26.693 --> 01:20:27.528
Ray!

01:20:27.594 --> 01:20:29.363
Who's your boyfriend with, huh?

01:20:29.429 --> 01:20:30.531
- Who's out there?
- I don't know.

01:20:31.833 --> 01:20:32.666
Where are the diamonds?

01:20:34.368 --> 01:20:35.837
Tell me, you motherfucker.

01:20:40.574 --> 01:20:44.645
I don't have
the fuckin' diamonds, I swear!

01:20:44.712 --> 01:20:45.679
Tell me.

01:20:48.181 --> 01:20:49.383
I don't have them!

01:20:55.757 --> 01:20:57.859
What the fuck are
you doin' out there?

01:21:23.885 --> 01:21:27.454
Even with your warning,

01:21:27.521 --> 01:21:33.427
it was the most courageous thing
she could have done.

01:21:33.493 --> 01:21:34.628
Life for a life.

01:21:37.598 --> 01:21:39.166
Life for a life.

01:22:23.878 --> 01:22:27.214
Jimmy.

01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:30.651
What are you doin' down here?

01:22:30.718 --> 01:22:32.452
Jimmy.

01:22:35.723 --> 01:22:36.824
Sorry, kiddo.

01:22:36.891 --> 01:22:38.225
Put pressure on that.

01:22:38.291 --> 01:22:39.192
I didn't mean to shoot you.

01:22:39.259 --> 01:22:40.460
I swear to God,
I didn't mean it.

01:22:40.527 --> 01:22:41.561
Holy shit.

01:22:42.930 --> 01:22:44.398
I found them under the bed.

01:22:44.464 --> 01:22:45.933
I thought you were supposed
to lock him up downstairs.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:46.901
I did!

01:22:46.968 --> 01:22:48.468
Well, he's fuckin' here,
isn't he?

01:22:48.535 --> 01:22:49.837
Where's Terry?

01:22:49.904 --> 01:22:51.706
Give me those fuckin' diamonds.

01:23:00.081 --> 01:23:01.049
You hid these?

01:23:01.115 --> 01:23:03.617
It's not... it's not
what you think?

01:23:07.055 --> 01:23:09.356
- They tried to scam us.
- That's bullshit.

01:23:09.423 --> 01:23:11.458
- They tried to scam us both.
- Bullshit.

01:23:11.525 --> 01:23:13.493
You don't know
what you're talkin' about.

01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:14.695
Well, what is he talkin' about?

01:23:14.762 --> 01:23:15.529
I don't fuckin' know.

01:23:15.595 --> 01:23:16.931
Look at him, he's delirious.

01:23:18.066 --> 01:23:20.467
Ray, it's true.

01:23:20.534 --> 01:23:22.003
Hey, you think I'm gonna
fuck over my own cousin,

01:23:22.070 --> 01:23:23.637
asshole?

01:23:23.705 --> 01:23:25.605
It's true.

01:23:25.672 --> 01:23:26.606
It's true.

01:23:28.575 --> 01:23:31.545
It was fuckin' you,
wasn't it, Sal?

01:23:31.611 --> 01:23:34.015
You're gonna believe this guy
over me?

01:23:34.082 --> 01:23:35.049
- Did you, son of bitch?
- Hey.

01:23:35.116 --> 01:23:36.984
Were you covering
for your own loss?

01:23:37.051 --> 01:23:38.019
Get your fuckin' hands off me.

01:23:38.086 --> 01:23:39.187
Why did you fuckin'
do that to me?

01:23:39.252 --> 01:23:40.654
I want the diamonds!

01:23:45.827 --> 01:23:47.527
Terry, take it easy.

01:23:47.594 --> 01:23:48.963
Like I said, no more blood.

01:23:49.030 --> 01:23:50.564
Come on.

01:23:50.630 --> 01:23:51.799
No blood.

01:23:51.866 --> 01:23:52.767
You motherfuck...

01:23:56.636 --> 01:23:58.438
What are you...
what are you doing?

01:23:58.505 --> 01:23:59.774
What do you think I'm doin'?

01:23:59.841 --> 01:24:02.442
I told you, it's my family.

01:24:02.509 --> 01:24:04.311
No blood, I fuckin' told you!

01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:09.751
Let's get the diamonds,
get the fuck out of here.

01:24:13.888 --> 01:24:14.789
Stupid choices, kid.

01:24:45.987 --> 01:24:47.722
Oh my God!

01:24:49.556 --> 01:24:50.091
Oh.

01:24:50.158 --> 01:24:51.926
Oh no.

01:24:51.993 --> 01:24:53.027
Jesus.

01:24:55.428 --> 01:24:57.098
Here.

01:24:57.165 --> 01:24:58.365
Hang in there.

01:24:58.431 --> 01:24:59.399
Hang in there.

01:25:04.571 --> 01:25:07.374
Elliot.

01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:09.376
How do you know my name?

01:25:09.442 --> 01:25:10.745
I c... I couldn't change it.

01:25:11.813 --> 01:25:16.150
I... it's all f... fated.

01:25:18.820 --> 01:25:20.054
Who are you?

01:25:22.190 --> 01:25:25.392
J... J... James.

01:25:25.458 --> 01:25:26.626
James.

01:25:26.693 --> 01:25:29.163
Oden.

01:25:29.230 --> 01:25:30.765
James Oden.

01:25:31.766 --> 01:25:32.767
Find me.

01:25:35.102 --> 01:25:36.403
E... Elton Hills.

01:25:38.005 --> 01:25:41.474
Foster... foster.

01:25:41.541 --> 01:25:43.643
Hold steady, hang in there.

01:25:58.059 --> 01:26:01.095
ELLIOT How did you get
this in your bloodstream?

01:26:25.853 --> 01:26:27.520
They say when you die,

01:26:27.587 --> 01:26:30.657
your whole life flashes
before your eyes.

01:26:35.629 --> 01:26:37.530
I wish it were that simple.

01:26:46.774 --> 01:26:47.742
Elliot once said

01:26:47.808 --> 01:26:49.010
that when you're
in the thick of it...

01:26:51.946 --> 01:26:52.847
...life is nothing

01:26:52.914 --> 01:26:54.882
but a collection
of random events,

01:26:54.949 --> 01:26:58.551
crashing into each other,
causing chaos and confusion.

01:27:04.926 --> 01:27:07.627
And that
only in retrospect would we see

01:27:07.694 --> 01:27:09.764
it wasn't random at all.

01:27:14.769 --> 01:27:17.637
The adversity we faced,
it was all there by design

01:27:17.705 --> 01:27:19.974
forcing us to define
ourselves...

01:27:24.211 --> 01:27:26.579
...not by our mistakes
in the past...

01:27:29.250 --> 01:27:31.719
...but by our choices
in the present.

01:28:09.689 --> 01:28:11.959
Angela.

01:28:22.635 --> 01:28:24.905
Maybe it is that simple.
