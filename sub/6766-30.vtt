WEBVTT

00:08.299 --> 00:09.467
All right, everyone,

00:09.551 --> 00:11.261
{\an3}thank you very much.
Thank you.

00:11.344 --> 00:14.973
{\an1}You can help yourself
to some coffee if you'd like.

00:15.056 --> 00:18.309
I want that in <i> Billboard,</i> the
CVC Report and all the trades

00:18.393 --> 00:19.477
Monday.

00:19.561 --> 00:21.563
{\an3}Usual copy: "Excited to ink
new music-video producers

00:21.646 --> 00:23.440
Martin and Silver for
collaboration with our artist."

00:23.523 --> 00:24.441
You know the drill.

00:24.524 --> 00:25.567
Right.

00:25.650 --> 00:26.943
Um, Erik,

00:27.026 --> 00:28.236
{\an3}you know we didn't
actually read the contracts

00:28.319 --> 00:29.279
before we signed them.

00:29.362 --> 00:31.281
Actually, you just signed
for two turkeys on wheat

00:31.364 --> 00:33.283
and a chicken salad.

00:33.366 --> 00:34.617
{\an3}The Legal's got
the real contract.

00:34.701 --> 00:35.785
{\an1}It's long distance,
line two.

00:35.869 --> 00:36.953
{\an3}Uh, great.

00:37.036 --> 00:39.122
Budman here.

00:39.205 --> 00:40.623
Hey, what's up?

00:40.707 --> 00:43.293
Oh, man, I never realized

00:43.376 --> 00:44.627
{\an3}they managed
all these artists.

00:44.711 --> 00:46.129
{\an1}Who do you think
they're going

00:46.212 --> 00:47.589
{\an1}to give us for
our first video?

00:47.672 --> 00:48.631
{\an3}Who cares?

00:48.715 --> 00:51.092
{\an3}This is like
the Hall of Fame.

00:51.176 --> 00:52.302
Look at this.

00:52.385 --> 00:53.970
{\an6}BUDMAN:
Are we go for
this weekend?

00:55.930 --> 00:59.309
Great. Thanks, buddy.

00:59.392 --> 01:02.145
{\an3}I knew this was
going to be magic.

01:02.228 --> 01:03.813
We just signed
this amazing band.

01:03.897 --> 01:04.980
You're doing their video.

01:05.063 --> 01:07.317
{\an3}I've been trying for weeks
to set up a showcase for them,

01:07.400 --> 01:08.651
and the minute we lock you,

01:08.735 --> 01:10.737
the club calls with an open date
this weekend.

01:10.820 --> 01:13.448
{\an3}(laughs)
That's great.

01:13.531 --> 01:14.824
Saturday night
at the Peach Pit After Dark.

01:14.908 --> 01:15.825
It's on Olympic.

01:15.909 --> 01:16.743
Yeah, we know it.

01:16.826 --> 01:18.536
{\an3}Actually we, we kind of
know the owner.

01:18.620 --> 01:19.996
See? It's karma.

01:20.079 --> 01:21.998
Who's the group?

01:22.081 --> 01:23.291
{\an3}Nobody yet.

01:23.374 --> 01:24.501
But they are so hot.

01:24.584 --> 01:25.460
Especially the singer.

01:25.543 --> 01:28.838
{\an3}Plays great guitar,
writes all the material.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.131
Drop-dead sexy, this guy.

01:30.215 --> 01:31.174
They're gonna be huge.

01:31.257 --> 01:33.968
Guy's name is Pruit.
Ray Pruit.

03:43.097 --> 03:45.058

(door closes)

04:10.750 --> 04:11.751
All right, kids.

04:11.834 --> 04:16.214
Today I refuse to watch Montel
or Oprah or Geraldo

04:16.297 --> 04:18.048
or any other
one-named talk show host.

04:18.132 --> 04:20.343
Hold on. What have we here?

04:20.426 --> 04:21.511
{\an1}STEVE:
Is that <i> Vega$?</i>

04:21.594 --> 04:22.512
{\an3}Yes, sir,

04:22.595 --> 04:24.013
that is <i> Vega$.</i>

04:24.097 --> 04:25.515
The surfing stops here.

04:25.598 --> 04:27.308
<i>Vega$?</i> Why?

04:27.392 --> 04:28.309
Why?

04:28.393 --> 04:29.811
Come Why <i> Vega$?</i>

04:29.894 --> 04:31.521
{\an4}(chuckling):
We're talking
about Dan Tanna,

04:31.604 --> 04:32.522
the guardian
of Sin City.

04:32.605 --> 04:33.856
The coolest of the cool.

04:33.940 --> 04:35.024
What a car. What a car.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.359
{\an3}He's got a
great car.

04:36.442 --> 04:38.528
Is it just me,
or is there something unseemly

04:38.611 --> 04:40.863
about 20-year-olds
being nostalgic?

04:40.947 --> 04:41.864
I don't know.

04:41.948 --> 04:43.700
God bless America.

04:43.783 --> 04:45.702
Robert Urich!

04:45.785 --> 04:46.869
{\an1}Wasn't Bart Braverman
in this show?

04:46.953 --> 04:49.372
Bart Braverman!

04:49.455 --> 04:52.041
{\an5}DAVID:
<i>Well, there's always</i>
<i>a bright side.</i>

04:52.125 --> 04:54.210
{\an3}At least they didn't
stick us with the, uh...

04:54.293 --> 04:56.045
Charlie Manson Band
for our next video.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.380
Don't joke about this.

04:57.463 --> 04:58.715
I am freaking out here.

04:58.798 --> 05:00.383
I cannot work with Ray.

05:00.466 --> 05:02.552
Donna, we have to at least have
this meeting, all right?

05:02.635 --> 05:03.553
We owe

05:03.636 --> 05:04.679
{\an3}that much
to Erik.

05:04.762 --> 05:06.723
Well, what am I supposed
to say to Ray?

05:06.806 --> 05:08.766
Donna, relax, all right?

05:08.850 --> 05:10.560
It's over between you and Ray.

05:10.643 --> 05:12.770
Besides, he's not going to want
to do this video with us

05:12.854 --> 05:14.856
{\an3}any more than we want
to do it with him.

05:14.939 --> 05:18.192
I mean, if Joe finds out about
this, he is going to flip out.

05:18.276 --> 05:20.069
You know what?
It's none of my business,

05:20.153 --> 05:22.155
but I don't think
you should say anything to Joe.

05:22.238 --> 05:24.365
Donna, we're gonna have

05:24.449 --> 05:26.242
this meeting, then the
whole thing is going to be over.

05:26.325 --> 05:28.369
You think so?

05:28.453 --> 05:29.370
{\an3}Yes.

05:29.454 --> 05:32.206
Why cause any more problems?

05:32.290 --> 05:34.709
Fine.

05:34.792 --> 05:35.877
You're right.

05:35.960 --> 05:37.170
I won't tell Joe.

05:43.301 --> 05:45.219
JOE:
<i>Tell me the truth.</i>

05:45.303 --> 05:46.346
You're doing fine.

05:46.429 --> 05:48.765
{\an3}All the equipment's working
just the way it should.

05:48.848 --> 05:50.475
Here, see for yourself.

05:50.558 --> 05:53.269
{\an1}Yeah, like I know what
(chuckles)g at.

05:53.352 --> 05:57.065
Yeah, well, you go and
you have a great life.

05:57.148 --> 05:58.441
Sure. thank you.

05:58.524 --> 05:59.776
Sure.s for everything.

05:59.859 --> 06:00.568
Just don't forget.

06:00.651 --> 06:02.904
Reserve my Rose
Bowl seats now.

06:02.987 --> 06:04.197
(chuckles)

06:04.280 --> 06:06.074
{\an3}Actually, Dr. Martin,
I don't know

06:06.157 --> 06:07.992
{\an3}if I'll be playing
football next season.

06:08.076 --> 06:09.660
Why not?
Your health is fine.

06:09.744 --> 06:11.079
You don't have
to give up football.

06:11.162 --> 06:12.789
Oh, I'm not going to give it up.

06:12.872 --> 06:14.373
I'm just not going to play.

06:14.457 --> 06:17.168
{\an3}I'm gonna go back home
and coach high school ball.

06:17.251 --> 06:18.377
Pennsylvania?

06:18.461 --> 06:20.004
{\an3}That's right, Beaver
Falls High School.

06:20.088 --> 06:21.589
That's where my dad
used to coach.

06:21.672 --> 06:23.007
Both my brother and I
played there.

06:23.091 --> 06:24.175
They lost the coach

06:24.258 --> 06:26.552
and they asked me to come out
and help for the summer.

06:26.636 --> 06:28.096
Oh, well, it's just
for the summer then?

06:28.179 --> 06:29.972
No.

06:30.056 --> 06:32.809
In the fall, I'm gonna take over
the program full-time.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.148
Does Donna know this?

06:39.232 --> 06:40.983
Not yet.

06:41.067 --> 06:42.860
She's going to be heartbroken
that you're leaving.

06:42.944 --> 06:44.570
She cares a lot about you.

06:46.155 --> 06:50.326
And I care a lot about her.

06:50.409 --> 06:51.911
So can I ask you a favor?

06:51.994 --> 06:54.288
Yeah, sure.

06:55.248 --> 06:57.375
Don't say anything to Donna,

06:57.458 --> 06:59.377
just for a while.

06:59.460 --> 07:01.671
{\an3}When do you plan
on talking to her?

07:01.754 --> 07:05.174
I don't know.

07:05.258 --> 07:06.843
Soon.

07:14.350 --> 07:17.186
{\an3}I don't know how to
break this to you, Kel,

07:17.270 --> 07:18.855
{\an3}but if that's your
homework, it's late.

07:18.938 --> 07:19.856
School's out.

07:19.939 --> 07:21.023
No, not for me.

07:21.107 --> 07:22.483
I have a lot to make up.

07:22.567 --> 07:23.484
Summer semester, huh?

07:23.568 --> 07:25.361
If I'm lucky.

07:25.444 --> 07:27.196
Hey, Nat, uh,
can you come next door?

07:27.280 --> 07:28.364
The bondsman's waiting.

07:28.447 --> 07:30.533
{\an1}Ugh, that guy gives me
the creeps.

07:30.616 --> 07:31.701
He's all right.

07:31.784 --> 07:32.618
He's a snake.

07:32.702 --> 07:34.495
Well, then you ought
to get along with him

07:34.579 --> 07:37.039
just fine, Valerie.

07:37.123 --> 07:39.167
{\an1}It's nice to see you,
too, Kel.

07:39.250 --> 07:41.544
Enjoy school.

07:41.627 --> 07:44.338
Thanks. I will.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.219
Mr. Carr.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.013
{\an3}Ms. Malone.

07:52.096 --> 07:54.056
{\an1}This is my partner
Nat Bussichio.

07:54.140 --> 07:58.227
Well, any partner of Val's
is a partner of mine,

07:58.311 --> 08:00.897
{\an3}technically
speaking.

08:00.980 --> 08:03.566
{\an1}Can I get you a cup of coffee
or a beer or something?

08:03.649 --> 08:06.068
{\an3}No, thanks.

08:06.152 --> 08:09.447
{\an1}Technically speaking, where
exactly do we stand here?

08:09.530 --> 08:11.365
{\an3}Luckily, we still
have some time.

08:11.449 --> 08:12.575
180 days to be exact.

08:12.658 --> 08:13.576
Cut to the chase.

08:13.659 --> 08:15.369
Where does that leave us?

08:15.453 --> 08:16.412
Well, according

08:16.495 --> 08:19.707
to your partnership papers,
your equity helped

08:19.790 --> 08:22.251
{\an3}to secure the money
necessary to build this club.

08:22.335 --> 08:23.920
{\an3}Therefore, I have
the legal right

08:24.003 --> 08:25.254
{\an3}to attach you
to any debt

08:25.338 --> 08:27.423
{\an3}I'm trying to recover
from Ms. Malone.

08:27.506 --> 08:29.759
That is, of course, if
Colin doesn't return.

08:29.842 --> 08:31.427
I'm sorry, Nat.

08:31.510 --> 08:34.472
It's okay.

08:34.554 --> 08:36.890
Couldn't we hire someone
to find Robbins,

08:36.974 --> 08:39.602
like a, a bounty hunter
or a detective?

08:39.684 --> 08:42.020
They usually take
25% of the bond,

08:42.104 --> 08:44.565
{\an3}and that cost would have
to be underwritten entirely

08:44.649 --> 08:45.816
{\an3}by you.

08:45.900 --> 08:48.069
That's $25,000.

08:48.152 --> 08:51.280
{\an3}Well, there's always one last
option I tell my clients.

08:51.364 --> 08:52.281
What's that?

08:52.365 --> 08:53.407
{\an3}Put the
prisoner's picture

08:53.491 --> 08:56.285
on a milk carton
and hope we get lucky.

08:57.328 --> 08:59.372
(quietly):
He's a snake.

09:05.044 --> 09:07.964
I love Las Vegas.

09:08.047 --> 09:10.341
(both laughing)

09:10.424 --> 09:12.260
Great, great show.

09:12.343 --> 09:13.261
Great writers.

09:13.344 --> 09:15.054
{\an1}Yeah, great writers,
great writers.

09:15.137 --> 09:17.181
{\an1}I-I never would have thought
that the hooker...

09:17.265 --> 09:18.432
{\an1}...was fixing
the roulette wheel

09:18.516 --> 09:19.642
{\an1}to pay
for her mother's operation.

09:19.725 --> 09:20.977
What a heart.gs)

09:21.060 --> 09:23.521
{\an1}Heart, heart,
the girl had heart.

09:23.604 --> 09:26.190
Don't get up.

09:26.274 --> 09:28.025
TV ANNOUNCER:
Now, stay tuned for <i> Matt Houston</i>

09:28.109 --> 09:29.277
as our 24-hour Macho Marathon
continues.

09:29.360 --> 09:31.195
{\an1}<i>Matt Houston,</i>
now, isn't that it?

09:31.279 --> 09:32.822
Too easy.

09:33.781 --> 09:36.200
Clare, you look great.

09:36.284 --> 09:38.035
Oh, thanks.

09:38.119 --> 09:39.537
Aw, you shouldn't have.

09:39.620 --> 09:42.498
I didn't, actually.
They're for Steve.

09:42.581 --> 09:43.874
Uh-huh, of course.

09:43.958 --> 09:45.209
How thoughtful.

09:45.293 --> 09:46.877
{\an3}STEVE:
Is that Carl?

09:46.961 --> 09:48.671
Come Hey-hey.arl.

09:48.754 --> 09:50.006
The boys are involved

09:50.089 --> 09:53.009
in a, uh, hormonal
drivel-fest here on TV.

09:53.092 --> 09:54.677
{\an3}Well, I don't watch
much TV, but...

09:54.760 --> 09:56.012
Oh, for me, flowers?

09:56.095 --> 09:57.013
{\an3}These are
for you.

09:57.096 --> 09:58.848
Oh, you're a prince
of a guy.

09:58.931 --> 10:00.558
(laughter)

10:00.641 --> 10:03.019
{\an1}Clare, would you take care
of those somewhere in...

10:03.102 --> 10:05.938
(mocks mumbling)

10:06.022 --> 10:07.523
(sighs)are you feeling?

10:07.606 --> 10:09.025
{\an3}Yeah.

10:09.108 --> 10:11.027
{\an3}Hold on, tell me this
isn't <i> Matt Houston?</i>

10:11.110 --> 10:12.653
Oh, this is my favorite show.

10:12.737 --> 10:14.030
{\an1}I watched it all the time
as a kid.

10:14.113 --> 10:15.990
{\an3}I've seen
every episode.

10:16.073 --> 10:17.199
I even tried
to convince my parents

10:17.283 --> 10:19.535
to let me commute
to school by helicopter.

10:19.618 --> 10:20.536
Well, join us, brother.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.246
You're in good company.

10:22.330 --> 10:23.789
Oh, this is the one
where the gourmet chef

10:23.873 --> 10:26.542
{\an1}is found murdered
in the bowl of Jell-O.

10:26.625 --> 10:28.544
Clare, come here.
You have to see this.

10:28.627 --> 10:29.879
No, I don't.

10:29.962 --> 10:31.881
What's the matter with her?

10:31.964 --> 10:33.716
Hmm, she's bored.

10:33.799 --> 10:34.884
{\an1}Look,?

10:34.967 --> 10:36.385
you want to make
me feel better?

10:36.469 --> 10:37.720
{\an3}(chuckles)

10:37.803 --> 10:39.555
Get her out of here.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.724
Clare, why don't you
get dressed?

10:41.807 --> 10:42.725
I'm taking you

10:42.808 --> 10:45.227
{\an3}to dinner--
anywhere you want.

10:45.311 --> 10:48.022
Good, as long
as it's not with him.

10:48.105 --> 10:49.231
(growls)

10:49.315 --> 10:50.691
Don't worry, Steve.
She's in good hands.

10:50.775 --> 10:52.693
I'll bring her home
in one piece.

10:52.777 --> 10:55.529
{\an3}Hey, um, do you want something
to drink while you wait?

10:55.613 --> 10:57.239
No, sit down.

10:57.323 --> 10:59.408
{\an3}Just point me in
the right direction.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.827
Good.o-over there.

11:03.287 --> 11:07.249
{\an1}Well, Carl sure jumped at
the chance to take out Clare.

11:07.333 --> 11:08.459
Ah, they're
old friends.

11:08.542 --> 11:10.961
Okay, just checking.

11:13.297 --> 11:15.299
Relax.

11:20.346 --> 11:21.931
You shouldn't
have run, man.

11:22.014 --> 11:24.600
The rest of us all got
off on illegal search.

11:24.683 --> 11:25.684
They dropped the charges

11:25.768 --> 11:28.479
{\an5}while you were doing
your,
uh, O.J. imitation.

11:28.562 --> 11:29.647
(laughs)

11:32.149 --> 11:33.567
It's pretty funny, actually.

11:33.651 --> 11:34.777
Yeah, that's hilarious,
isn't it?

11:34.860 --> 11:35.820
I don't know.

11:35.903 --> 11:37.405
Maybe you should
just do the deuce.

11:37.488 --> 11:38.572
Get it over with.

11:38.656 --> 11:39.824
What are you, nuts?

11:39.907 --> 11:41.867
It ain't happening, man.

11:41.951 --> 11:42.993
{\an3}Your call.

11:44.161 --> 11:46.080
So, uh, what's your plan?

11:46.163 --> 11:47.998
My plan is to get out
of this country.

11:48.082 --> 11:51.085
{\an3}My plan is to hit the border
as fast as I Wow.

11:51.168 --> 11:52.294
You got any ID?

11:52.378 --> 11:55.506
You know, the kind that doesn't
say "Bust me, please" on it?

11:55.589 --> 11:57.967
No.

11:58.050 --> 12:01.512
So, can you help me out?

12:01.595 --> 12:02.763
(clicks tongue)

12:02.847 --> 12:04.432
You're talking some major cash.

12:04.515 --> 12:05.474
That's great.

12:05.558 --> 12:06.976
First I get popped
because of you.

12:07.059 --> 12:08.519
Now you want to rip me off?

12:08.602 --> 12:09.979
Hey, hey, hey!

12:10.062 --> 12:12.189
I'm sorry about what
went down, all right?

12:12.273 --> 12:14.066
But the scratch ain't for me.

12:14.150 --> 12:15.359
It's for the paper.

12:16.402 --> 12:18.821
(whispers):
I'm sorry.

12:18.904 --> 12:21.323
{\an1}This whole thing
has me all wound up.

12:21.407 --> 12:22.867
All right, no worries.

12:28.414 --> 12:31.250
All right, I'll do
my best, all right?

12:32.251 --> 12:33.669
{\an3}Here.

12:33.752 --> 12:35.379
{\an3}Take this.

12:35.463 --> 12:37.673
{\an3}I just fired one
of my delivery boys.

12:37.756 --> 12:40.092
{\an3}I'll beep you
when I got what you need.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.186
{\an1}Thank you.

12:50.269 --> 12:51.645
Thank you.

12:51.729 --> 12:54.690
{\an1}I take it Steve's
I love him,iest patient.

12:54.774 --> 12:55.858
but, um, if you hadn't

12:55.941 --> 12:57.234
have gotten me out
of there tonight,

12:57.318 --> 12:59.695
{\an3}you may have found him dead
in t(chuckling)

12:59.778 --> 13:01.363
Well, to be honest,
if Steve hadn't suggested

13:01.447 --> 13:03.699
I take you to dinner,
I would have done it anyway.

13:03.782 --> 13:05.493
{\an3}You can't wait on him
hand and foot.

13:05.576 --> 13:06.869
Even a prince like Steve needs

13:06.952 --> 13:08.871
to fend for himself
every once in a while.

13:08.954 --> 13:10.873
And what about a prince
like you?

13:10.956 --> 13:12.208
I'm very self-sufficient.

13:12.291 --> 13:14.043
{\an1}Oh, yeah, I forgot,
when you, um,

13:14.126 --> 13:15.711
moved out of the palace,
you learned how

13:15.794 --> 13:17.880
to order room service
all by yourself, didn't you?

13:17.963 --> 13:19.882
Tease me all you want.
I did it to you long enough.

13:19.965 --> 13:20.841
{\an3}MmWell,

13:20.925 --> 13:22.801
at least your mother always
believed in me.

13:22.885 --> 13:24.386
She knew I had potential.

13:24.470 --> 13:26.055
{\an3}She Yes.

13:26.138 --> 13:28.057
{\an1}Do you remember
Yeah.tenth birthday party?

13:28.140 --> 13:30.893
My mom let us drink champagne
out of her glass.

13:30.976 --> 13:32.728
And she told us
whatever we wished for

13:32.811 --> 13:34.230
that night would come true.

13:34.313 --> 13:35.898
{\an3}To tell you
So, what'd youthe truth,

13:35.981 --> 13:37.107
I don't remember,

13:37.191 --> 13:38.734
but I do remember
your mom had lots

13:38.817 --> 13:39.818
of plans for you.

13:39.902 --> 13:41.946
Do you know what she told me
after you went to bed?

13:42.029 --> 13:44.031
{\an3}She told me
that you and I

13:44.114 --> 13:45.032
would be married someday.

13:45.115 --> 13:47.451
She wanted you to grow up
to be a princess.

13:48.452 --> 13:51.705
My mom was a hopeless romantic.

13:51.789 --> 13:53.082
And you?

13:54.124 --> 13:55.709
I think I stopped believing

13:55.793 --> 13:57.795
in fairy tales the day she died.

14:00.464 --> 14:02.174
You must miss her very much.

14:03.968 --> 14:06.804
Yeah, I do.

14:11.058 --> 14:12.935
{\an5}ERIK:
<i>I have such an amazing feeling</i>
<i>about this.</i>

14:13.018 --> 14:14.228
<i>I mean, what are the odds</i>

14:14.311 --> 14:15.437
of you guys knowing Ray?

14:15.521 --> 14:17.773
{\an3}We fast forward past the whole
"getting to know you" thing.

14:17.856 --> 14:18.941
It's gonna be great.

14:19.024 --> 14:20.317
{\an3}You know, Ray's
pumped, too.

14:20.401 --> 14:22.152
{\an1}What, uh...
what did Ray say?

14:22.236 --> 14:24.071
Just that he couldn't
wait to see you again.

14:24.154 --> 14:26.365
{\an3}There was a lot of lost
time to make up for.

14:26.448 --> 14:28.742
{\an3}So look, you guys talk,
genius to genius,

14:28.826 --> 14:30.411
and then we'll all
go to the Eclipse

14:30.494 --> 14:32.621
and have some
dinner on me.

14:32.705 --> 14:33.747
{\an1}You okay?

14:33.831 --> 14:36.166
No, not really.

14:43.382 --> 14:45.175
{\an3}As long as you guys all know
each other, don't let me

14:45.259 --> 14:47.303
get in the way.

14:50.723 --> 14:51.849
Hi, Donna.

14:51.932 --> 14:53.350
{\an1}Hi, Ray.

14:54.351 --> 14:56.020
Small world, huh?

14:57.021 --> 15:00.149
Look, Ray, we all
know the chances

15:00.232 --> 15:03.527
{\an3}of this working are
slim and none, so

15:03.611 --> 15:05.321
{\an1}why don't we just
tell Erik that we had

15:05.404 --> 15:07.448
{\an3}creative differences
and go home.

15:08.449 --> 15:09.950
Do you feel that way,
too, Donna?

15:10.909 --> 15:12.036
I don't know.

15:12.119 --> 15:13.704
{\an3}Look, I've given this
a lot of thought.

15:13.787 --> 15:14.830
{\an3}Number one,

15:14.913 --> 15:17.207
I loved what you guys did
with the Powerman video.

15:17.291 --> 15:18.751
I thought it was amazing.

15:18.834 --> 15:22.212
And number two...
you guys know me,

15:22.296 --> 15:24.882
{\an3}and you know my music...
and this song

15:24.965 --> 15:26.675
I wrote, "Reckless," uh...

15:26.759 --> 15:29.011
well, it's kind
of about who I was,

15:29.094 --> 15:31.388
and nobody knows that person
better than you, Donna.

15:31.472 --> 15:32.890
Look, I'm talking

15:32.973 --> 15:34.308
about second chances,

15:34.391 --> 15:36.185
a chance to
show you all

15:36.268 --> 15:38.228
{\an3}that I'm a pretty
decent guy.

15:38.312 --> 15:41.023
I know it's a lot to ask for.

15:41.106 --> 15:42.524
{\an3}WOMAN:
Ray?

15:42.608 --> 15:44.193
Oh, I'm sorry.

15:44.276 --> 15:46.236
Excuse me. I'll just come back
when you're done.

15:46.320 --> 15:48.822
{\an3}No, it's okay,
Wends, come on in.

15:50.574 --> 15:53.494
{\an1}Uh, David, Donna,
this is Wendy Stevens.

15:53.577 --> 15:56.955
Uh, we're kind of engaged.

15:58.290 --> 15:59.875
Uh, it's nice to meet you.

15:59.958 --> 16:00.876
{\an3}Hi.

16:00.959 --> 16:02.211
Hi.

16:02.294 --> 16:03.379
{\an1}Hi.

16:03.462 --> 16:05.547
{\an1}Um, I mean,
congratulations.

16:05.631 --> 16:07.883
Uh, Ray
didn'tOh.ll us.

16:07.966 --> 16:09.718
Well, Ray told me a
lot about you guys,

16:09.802 --> 16:10.886
{\an3}especially
you, Donna.

16:10.969 --> 16:12.221
{\an3}It's a real pleasure
meeting you.

16:12.304 --> 16:13.722
Well, listen, I'm
sorry I barged in.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.557
{\an3}I'll just come back
when you guys are done.

16:15.641 --> 16:17.559
No, it's okay, um...

16:17.643 --> 16:19.144
we're finished.

16:20.145 --> 16:21.230
No, we're not.

16:21.313 --> 16:22.731
Um, when do we get

16:22.815 --> 16:25.067
a chance to listen
to the new material?

16:25.150 --> 16:27.194
{\an1}Well, we have a show
tomorrow night.

16:27.277 --> 16:28.987
I hope you like it.

16:30.072 --> 16:31.156
{\an1}So, you guys
cooking with gas?

16:32.282 --> 16:34.076
Uh, yeah, yeah,
we're getting warmer.

16:34.159 --> 16:35.744
Enough percolating.
Come on, everybody.

16:35.828 --> 16:37.121
It's time for dinner.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.877
{\an3}Donna, you don't know
how much this means to me.

16:44.962 --> 16:46.714
I think I do.

16:46.797 --> 16:48.757
I'm really happy for you, Ray.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.217
Thanks.

16:50.300 --> 16:52.720
{\an3}My life's kind of working
out okay, isn't it?

16:52.803 --> 16:53.804
Yeah, looks like it is.

17:18.328 --> 17:19.913
Hey, Beavis, can
you and Butthead

17:19.997 --> 17:22.082
{\an3}use the mute button
occasionally?

17:24.877 --> 17:29.423
♪♪

17:31.508 --> 17:32.926
{\an3}BRANDON:
Bad night?

17:33.010 --> 17:35.179
Only if you think sleep
is a good thing.

17:35.262 --> 17:37.598
{\an3}Only on Mondays
and Tuesdays.

17:37.681 --> 17:40.476
You know, I can't believe
I let Colin do this to me.

17:40.559 --> 17:43.979
{\an1}How stupid...
how stupid was I?

17:44.062 --> 17:46.607
Brandon, you've got to help me.

17:46.690 --> 17:47.816
{\an1}Anything.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.651
{\an3}Well, I was thinking.
I mean, Colin

17:49.735 --> 17:51.695
only had one friend,
and that was his dealer, right?

17:51.779 --> 17:52.821
Danny V.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.114
{\an3}Yeah, maybe he
went there.

17:54.198 --> 17:55.699
I mean, maybe we ought
to look him up.

17:55.783 --> 17:57.743
Good idea. We'll look him up
in the yellow pages.

17:57.826 --> 17:58.660
I'm sure he's listed

17:58.744 --> 18:00.496
{\an1}under drug dealers,
or we could just go down

18:00.579 --> 18:01.914
to the corner
of Crack and Eightball.

18:01.997 --> 18:03.207
I'm sure he'll turn up there
eventually.

18:03.290 --> 18:06.335
No, I think Kelly
knows where he is.

18:06.418 --> 18:08.629
{\an3}I was thinking maybe
you could ask her.

18:08.712 --> 18:10.547
Sure, yeah, I could do that...

18:10.631 --> 18:13.717
but, um, you gotta go with me.

18:14.760 --> 18:17.096
Val,r mind.

18:17.179 --> 18:19.097
you and Kelly can't keep going
around and around like this.

18:19.181 --> 18:20.516
You want to ask her
for her help.

18:20.599 --> 18:21.683
Do the right thing.

18:22.643 --> 18:24.019
All right.

18:24.102 --> 18:25.896
All right, I'll go.

18:32.110 --> 18:33.195
Donna.

18:33.278 --> 18:34.196
Hi.

18:34.279 --> 18:36.365
HeyHey.u.

18:36.448 --> 18:38.992
{\an3}Um, you know, I tried
to call you last night.

18:39.076 --> 18:40.869
Your line was busy
for, like, hours.

18:40.953 --> 18:42.704
Yeah, I was on the phone
with my mom.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.832
{\an1}Oh, really?
She's fine.oing?

18:44.915 --> 18:46.708

18:49.294 --> 18:51.046
Yeah, we sure are.

18:51.129 --> 18:52.047
{\an3}Great.

18:52.130 --> 18:53.841
Yeah.ike the music?

18:53.924 --> 18:54.800
Yeah, I really do.

18:54.883 --> 18:56.718
I... I think it's gonna
be a great project.

18:56.802 --> 18:59.012
Cool, what's the
name of the band?

18:59.096 --> 19:01.056
Um... (sighs)

19:01.139 --> 19:03.517
you know, you're not gonna
believe this,

19:03.600 --> 19:06.562
but, uh... it's Ray's band.

19:06.645 --> 19:08.313
Ray?

19:08.397 --> 19:09.940
As in Ray Pruit?

19:10.983 --> 19:12.401
Yeah.

19:12.484 --> 19:14.027
And you're gonna do this?

19:14.111 --> 19:15.571
{\an3}After what
he did

19:15.654 --> 19:17.239
{\an1}You know, I...
I think

19:17.322 --> 19:18.740
he's really changed.

19:18.824 --> 19:21.201
I mean, he's doing great.
He's engaged.

19:22.286 --> 19:23.996
Okay, it's your decision.

19:25.497 --> 19:27.791
Come on. Don't be like that.

19:27.875 --> 19:28.750
Don't be like what?

19:28.834 --> 19:30.460
Have you ever heard
of the word "loyalty"?

19:30.544 --> 19:33.547
You know, that is not fair.
I am loyal.

19:33.630 --> 19:35.465
I mean, this is business,
nothing else.

19:37.301 --> 19:39.469
Well, I guess you'll do
whatever you have to do.

19:39.553 --> 19:41.680
(sighs)
Joe.

19:42.931 --> 19:45.267
{\an1}Wait a second. I mean,
can't we even talk about this?

19:45.350 --> 19:46.727
Talk about what?

19:46.810 --> 19:48.812
{\an3}Sounds like you already
made your decision.

19:51.315 --> 19:53.150
(sighs)

19:59.197 --> 20:00.490
There she is.

20:00.574 --> 20:02.242
Kelly... hi.

20:02.326 --> 20:03.577
{\an3}Hey, what are
you doing here?

20:03.660 --> 20:05.704
Actually,
lookinOh.or you.

20:07.372 --> 20:09.416
What's going on?

20:09.499 --> 20:11.835
{\an1}We came here
to ask for your help.

20:11.919 --> 20:13.295
{\an3}Oh, well,

20:13.378 --> 20:14.963
if it has anything
to do with her,

20:15.047 --> 20:16.256
you can forget about it.

20:16.340 --> 20:17.758
{\an1}You know, I knew
this was a mistake.

20:17.841 --> 20:19.301
{\an1}She doesn't care
about anybody but herself.

20:19.384 --> 20:21.011
{\an3}I certainly don't care
about you, Valerie.

20:21.094 --> 20:23.430
Ladies, ladies, ladies,
neutral corners, huh?

20:23.513 --> 20:24.598
(nervous chuckle)

20:24.681 --> 20:26.600
Listen, Kel, this
doesn't only have

20:26.683 --> 20:27.809
{\an3}to do with Valerie,
all right?

20:27.893 --> 20:29.269
If we can't find Colin

20:29.353 --> 20:30.812
{\an1}and Valerie
loses the After Dark,

20:30.896 --> 20:32.314
{\an3}then Nat could lose
the Peach Pit,

20:32.397 --> 20:35.400
{\an3}so will you listen
to this, for Nat's sake?

20:36.401 --> 20:38.320
Yeah, I'll listen.

20:38.403 --> 20:39.988
For Nat's sake.

20:42.407 --> 20:44.493
{\an5}CARL:
<i>I think that you need</i>
<i>to get out of this house.</i>

20:44.576 --> 20:46.870
Clare said
that an old friend of yours

20:46.954 --> 20:48.330
{\an1}is playing
at the After Dark tonight.

20:48.413 --> 20:49.873
We're going.

20:49.957 --> 20:52.584
Whatever you say.

20:53.835 --> 20:56.088
And when are you getting
that wire out of your mouth?

20:56.171 --> 20:57.339
{\an1}Tomorrow.

20:57.422 --> 20:59.091
{\an3}Good, 'cause Clare and
I are getting tired

20:59.174 --> 21:00.342
{\an3}of this routine,
and we've got

21:00.425 --> 21:02.678
{\an3}big plans for you,
you and your birthday.

21:02.761 --> 21:04.012
What plans?

21:04.096 --> 21:06.556
I'm not gonna tell you
and ruin the surprise.

21:06.640 --> 21:09.184
{\an1}Okay, well,
just tell me one thing.

21:09.267 --> 21:10.519
Sure, what is it?

21:10.602 --> 21:11.520
Why are you doing this?

21:11.603 --> 21:15.399
{\an1}I mean, I'm a plebe,
a peasant, a commoner, man.

21:15.482 --> 21:16.942
{\an1}Why... why are you
being so nice?

21:17.025 --> 21:18.860
{\an3}That's one thing I love
about being a prince.

21:18.944 --> 21:20.320
I don't need a reason.

21:20.404 --> 21:21.321
Now, go get ready.

21:21.405 --> 21:22.823
{\an3}We're gonna hear
some music.

21:22.906 --> 21:24.449
Right on.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.372
Hey, Brandon.

21:30.455 --> 21:32.374
Come on in, man.
Good, man, good.

21:32.457 --> 21:34.209
Thanks, thanks.
You'Hey, this isell.

21:34.292 --> 21:35.544
{\an3}my fiancée,
Wendy Stevens.

21:35.627 --> 21:36.628
{\an1}It's nice
to meet you.

21:36.712 --> 21:37.838
Hi, nice to meet you.

21:37.921 --> 21:40.048
Uh, just wanted to come up and
tell you to have a good show.

21:40.132 --> 21:41.883
{\an3}Hey, thanks.
I'm gonna try.

21:41.967 --> 21:43.885
{\an3}Thanks for everything,
Brandon.

21:43.969 --> 21:44.886
What do you mean?

21:44.970 --> 21:47.014
{\an3}Well, a while back,
you were honest with me

21:47.097 --> 21:48.724
{\an3}when I needed
to hear the truth.

21:48.807 --> 21:50.726
{\an3}And I'm just really glad
I listened to you.

21:50.809 --> 21:52.561
{\an1}Looks like things are working
out pretty well for you.

21:52.644 --> 21:55.230
{\an3}Yeah, yeah, well,
I'm trying real hard.

21:55.313 --> 21:57.357
{\an1}Cool, hey look we'll see you
at the Pit later, huh?

21:57.441 --> 21:58.400
You got it.
AlOkay.ht.

21:58.483 --> 21:59.443
Nice to meet you.

21:59.526 --> 22:00.569
{\an3}WENDY:
Nice to meSee ya.

22:11.663 --> 22:13.582
It's a nice night.

22:13.665 --> 22:15.709
Well, you're a very nice guy.

22:17.169 --> 22:20.088
You know, I have a
confession to make.

22:20.172 --> 22:23.091
You're giving me credit
for something that, uh,

22:23.175 --> 22:25.093
I really don't deserve.

22:25.177 --> 22:27.095
{\an1}(chuckles)

22:27.179 --> 22:29.097
I don't understand.

22:29.181 --> 22:31.266
Well, the reason why
I'm not interfering

22:31.349 --> 22:33.602
with Ray's video is that,

22:33.685 --> 22:35.729
{\an3}I'm hoping that
it's your last one.

22:35.812 --> 22:38.732
My last one?

22:38.815 --> 22:40.901
I thought you supported me.

22:40.984 --> 22:42.944
{\an3}You and I--

22:43.028 --> 22:45.197
{\an3}we're such completely
different people.

22:47.240 --> 22:48.825
{\an3}Our lives.

22:48.909 --> 22:50.118
Our families.

22:50.202 --> 22:51.620
Where we grew up.

22:51.703 --> 22:53.121
How we grew up.

22:53.205 --> 22:54.956
{\an3}Our dreams.

22:55.040 --> 22:57.959
Yeah, but...

22:58.043 --> 22:59.628
but we share a lot, too.

22:59.711 --> 23:02.631
That's true.

23:02.714 --> 23:05.675
{\an3}You've done so much
for me this year.

23:05.759 --> 23:08.470
I'll always be grateful.

23:11.681 --> 23:13.642
Joe, what are you saying?

23:13.725 --> 23:16.478
It's just that...

23:16.561 --> 23:19.481
{\an3}I have a new dream that I
haven't told you about yet.

23:19.564 --> 23:21.525
What? What is it?

23:22.526 --> 23:24.444
Everything that happened--

23:24.528 --> 23:26.613
{\an1}my heart,

23:26.696 --> 23:29.616
not being able
to play ball,

23:29.699 --> 23:31.868
changed me.

23:31.952 --> 23:33.703
Well, yes, of course.

23:33.787 --> 23:35.789
{\an3}But it's made you
even stronger.

23:35.872 --> 23:37.791
Maybe.

23:37.874 --> 23:40.627
But all I can think about is

23:40.710 --> 23:42.796
{\an1}what Steve Young told me
on my birthday.

23:42.879 --> 23:45.340
{\an1}When he talked
about figuring out

23:45.423 --> 23:47.384
what to do with my life.

23:47.467 --> 23:50.470
I think I figured it out.

23:50.554 --> 23:52.472
What I'm gonna do.

23:52.556 --> 23:54.808
{\an3}What is it?

23:54.891 --> 23:56.810
I want to go back home.

23:56.893 --> 23:58.979
Back to Beaver Falls.

23:59.062 --> 24:02.232
{\an1}And I want more
than anything

24:02.315 --> 24:04.442
for you to come with me.

24:04.526 --> 24:07.696
{\an1}I know it's a long way
from the fast track in L.A.

24:07.779 --> 24:10.365
to being the...

24:10.448 --> 24:12.367
{\an1}the wife of a high school
football coach

24:12.450 --> 24:14.494
in Beaver Falls.

24:16.955 --> 24:19.374
But I love you.

24:21.668 --> 24:23.879
Will you marry me?

24:27.174 --> 24:29.342
Say something.

24:31.344 --> 24:33.597
{\an3}I don't...

24:33.680 --> 24:35.724
I don't know what to say.

24:36.683 --> 24:38.685
Say you love me.

24:40.145 --> 24:41.146
Say yes.

24:58.663 --> 25:00.040
Is this the place?

25:00.123 --> 25:01.541
{\an1}Yeah, this is
where Danny V lives.

25:01.625 --> 25:03.418
It's a couple of houses
All right.

25:03.501 --> 25:06.630
{\an3}If you're not out in five
minutes, I'm coming in.

25:15.639 --> 25:17.641
(knocking)

25:20.185 --> 25:22.229
{\an1}Hi.ly.

25:22.312 --> 25:23.313
Come on in.

25:23.396 --> 25:24.481
Are you alone?

25:24.564 --> 25:26.149
Yeah.

25:26.233 --> 25:27.817
Hey, I'm not gonna bite.

25:27.901 --> 25:29.277
Unless you ask real nice.

25:29.361 --> 25:31.613
I mean, is your
roommate here?

25:31.696 --> 25:33.156
Who, KirYeah., no, no.

25:33.240 --> 25:34.824
Uh, after you banged him over
the head with a wine bottle,

25:34.908 --> 25:36.618
he went a little dingy.
I had to get rid of him.

25:36.701 --> 25:38.745
{\an1}Come on.

25:41.665 --> 25:44.125
{\an3}So, uh, I was kinda
surprised you called.

25:44.209 --> 25:45.961
Yeah, well,
you know, uh,

25:46.044 --> 25:47.295
last time you left

25:47.379 --> 25:48.964
{\an3}parting wasn't any kind
of, uh, sweet sorrow.

25:49.047 --> 25:50.298
{\an3}You know what
I'm saying?

25:50.382 --> 25:52.300
Well, I was... messed up.

25:52.384 --> 25:53.343
{\an1}Yeah.

25:53.426 --> 25:55.303
But you're okay now,Yeah,

25:55.387 --> 25:57.305
just a little hungry,
if you know what I mean?

25:57.389 --> 25:58.473
Oh, you're hungry?

25:58.556 --> 26:00.183
Ah, right.

26:00.267 --> 26:02.185
{\an1}All that rehab talk doesn't
exactly fill the empty nights.

26:02.269 --> 26:04.688
You can say that again.

26:04.771 --> 26:05.981
Hmm?

26:06.064 --> 26:07.649
No, I'm fine.

26:10.735 --> 26:12.654
So what can I do you for?

26:12.737 --> 26:15.490
Um, well, I'm kinda
worried about Colin.

26:15.573 --> 26:17.575
Have you heard from him?

26:18.576 --> 26:20.495
Uh... Colin.

26:20.578 --> 26:22.163
Yeah, yeah, he's-he's gone.

26:22.247 --> 26:25.166
I know I hurt him, but I can't
let him go without me.

26:25.250 --> 26:27.002
He's my whole world.

26:27.085 --> 26:28.670
I really love him.

26:28.753 --> 26:30.171
You really mean that, don't you?

26:31.923 --> 26:33.174
Here.

26:33.258 --> 26:34.676
{\an3}Come sit.

26:34.759 --> 26:36.803
{\an3}So, you think
he's still in L.A.?

26:38.763 --> 26:40.515
{\an1}I don't know why
I'm gonna tell you this.

26:40.598 --> 26:42.183
I'm gonna tell you though.

26:42.267 --> 26:43.685
Yeah, he's still in L.A.

26:43.768 --> 26:45.854
{\an1}I don't know where,
but, uh,

26:45.937 --> 26:47.939
he's got a beeper.

26:50.025 --> 26:51.318
I'll give you the number.

26:51.401 --> 26:53.403
Great.

26:56.448 --> 26:58.450
Oh, thank you.

27:00.535 --> 27:02.162
So, what can I get you?

27:02.245 --> 27:03.705
I can go by weight.

27:03.788 --> 27:05.206
Um, just a gram.

27:05.290 --> 27:06.833
Gram, you Yeah.

27:06.916 --> 27:08.168
That's not much.

27:08.251 --> 27:10.462
{\an3}I gotta tell you,
this stuff is primo.

27:10.545 --> 27:12.881
Why don't you have a taste
with me?

27:12.964 --> 27:14.716
No, actually, I have to go.

27:14.799 --> 27:16.384
I-I'm meeting my mom somewhere.

27:16.468 --> 27:18.178
All the better.

27:19.262 --> 27:21.181
Maybe some other time, huh?

27:21.264 --> 27:23.058
I'll just take that gram
for now.

27:30.065 --> 27:32.525
{\an1}All right.

27:33.526 --> 27:35.111
That's it. I'm going in.

27:35.195 --> 27:37.238
Don't leave me here.

27:43.370 --> 27:45.288
I know how to find him.

27:45.372 --> 27:46.706
{\an1}Great. Let's get
out of here.

27:46.790 --> 27:48.208
{\an3}Did you buy
anything?

27:48.291 --> 27:49.376
Yeah, I had to.

27:49.459 --> 27:50.543
Give it to me.

27:50.627 --> 27:52.045
Brandon,
I'll take care of it.

27:52.128 --> 27:54.130
Give it to me.

28:14.943 --> 28:16.152
{\an3}Donna?

28:16.236 --> 28:18.154
{\an3}What are you doing
sittin' in the dark?

28:18.238 --> 28:20.281
Just sittin'.

28:21.241 --> 28:23.284
Are you okay?

28:24.536 --> 28:26.454
I don't know.

28:26.538 --> 28:28.748
What's wrong?

28:32.794 --> 28:35.338
Joe, uh...

28:35.422 --> 28:37.340
Joe decided to move back East.

28:37.424 --> 28:40.301
And he wants me
to go with him.

28:40.385 --> 28:42.345
He asked me to marry him.

28:42.429 --> 28:45.223
What?

28:45.306 --> 28:46.683
{\an3}Oh, my...

28:46.766 --> 28:49.310
wha... what-what did you say?

28:49.394 --> 28:51.980
I didn't say anything.

28:52.063 --> 28:53.982
Wow.

28:54.065 --> 28:56.317
Beaver Falls sounds
beautiful and all,

28:56.401 --> 28:58.153
but let's face it,

28:58.236 --> 29:00.155
I'm an L.A. girl.

29:00.238 --> 29:01.990
Do you love him?

29:02.073 --> 29:03.324
Yeah.

29:03.408 --> 29:04.826
{\an3}Well, then

29:04.909 --> 29:06.494
what's there to think about?

29:06.578 --> 29:09.581
Joe wants me to change
my whole life.

29:10.582 --> 29:12.167
I just...

29:12.250 --> 29:14.294
I don't know if I can do that.

29:17.755 --> 29:19.674
Well, when does he want
an answer?

29:19.757 --> 29:21.468
He wants to know right away.

29:23.428 --> 29:25.847
Well, if you want, I can stay up
with you tonight, you know.

29:25.930 --> 29:27.515
No.

29:27.599 --> 29:29.517
Thanks, but, um,

29:29.601 --> 29:30.935
you go to bed.

29:31.936 --> 29:34.022
Okay.

29:34.105 --> 29:36.107
Night.

29:38.943 --> 29:40.862
You know I've been

29:40.945 --> 29:42.906
{\an3}having my own brush
with destiny.

29:42.989 --> 29:44.824
{\an3}I've been
thinking

29:44.908 --> 29:47.243
a lot about my mom lately.

29:47.327 --> 29:50.330
You know, what kind of dreams
she might have had for me.

29:50.413 --> 29:53.041
{\an3}Being with Carl again
brings that

29:53.124 --> 29:55.877
all up.

29:55.960 --> 29:57.921
He really loved my mom,
you know.

29:58.004 --> 30:01.257
It must be nice to have someone
to share that with again.

30:01.341 --> 30:02.509
{\an3}It is.

30:02.592 --> 30:05.512
Carl keeps, um,

30:05.595 --> 30:08.598
bringing up the old memories.

30:10.600 --> 30:12.519
He told me that, uh,

30:12.602 --> 30:14.521
my mom told him

30:14.604 --> 30:17.106
she wanted us to have
a royal wedding one day.

30:17.190 --> 30:19.108
Wow.

30:19.192 --> 30:22.028
She really did have big dreams
for you, didn't she?

30:22.111 --> 30:25.031
Yeah.

30:25.114 --> 30:27.700
It's funny 'cause
later that night

30:27.784 --> 30:30.370
when she was putting me to bed,
she told me the same thing,

30:30.453 --> 30:32.372
{\an3}only Carl
doesn't know.

30:32.455 --> 30:34.290
Are you gonna tell hNo.

30:34.374 --> 30:37.126
I don't want him
to get the wrong idea.

30:38.628 --> 30:40.838
So, you sure you're okay?

30:40.922 --> 30:42.799
Yeah.

30:42.882 --> 30:45.051
Would you, uh, just turn out
the light though?

30:45.134 --> 30:47.470
Yeah.

30:48.888 --> 30:51.224
Don?

30:51.307 --> 30:52.809
Yeah.

30:52.892 --> 30:56.062
Remember when you
were a little girl

30:56.145 --> 30:58.565
and you used to fantasize
about your wedding day?

30:59.524 --> 31:01.859
Of course.

31:01.943 --> 31:03.820
Every little girl does.

31:03.903 --> 31:06.447
Those fantasies are all

31:06.531 --> 31:09.158
becoming a little too real,
aren't they?

31:11.202 --> 31:13.621
They sure are.

31:15.582 --> 31:17.000
Good night.

31:17.083 --> 31:18.960
Night.

31:34.559 --> 31:36.811
{\an3}Why don't you try
and page him again?

31:36.894 --> 31:38.813
I've already paged him
three times, Brandon.

31:38.896 --> 31:40.189
Maybe he doesn't know it's you.

31:40.273 --> 31:41.983
{\an4}KELLY:
Valerie, I think
he's called my car phone

31:42.066 --> 31:43.818
{\an1}enough to know
that it's my number.

31:43.901 --> 31:45.486
{\an3}Oh, that's right.
He's in love with you.

31:45.570 --> 31:46.487
I, I forgot.

31:46.571 --> 31:47.822
{\an3}BRANDON:
Guys,

31:47.905 --> 31:49.824
he's probably not even
in L.A. anymore, okay?

31:49.907 --> 31:50.950
{\an1}KELLY:
What if he is?

31:51.034 --> 31:52.994
{\an1}What exactly do you
plan on doing?

31:53.077 --> 31:55.163
Are you gonna ask him to
politely turn himself in,

31:55.246 --> 31:57.332
or are you just gonna
charge right in there,

31:57.415 --> 31:58.499
take care of things?

31:58.583 --> 31:59.667
I'm not afraid of Colin.

31:59.751 --> 32:01.502
BRANDON:
Oh,Ladies,am?

32:01.586 --> 32:04.505
we're on the same side
on this, okay?

32:04.589 --> 32:06.299
If he calls,
I say we set up the meeting,

32:06.382 --> 32:08.343
then we call the police
and let them do their job.

32:08.426 --> 32:10.011
You know, it's late.

32:10.094 --> 32:12.055
{\an3}Maybe he just turned the
beeper off and went to sleep.

32:12.138 --> 32:13.848
Yeah, maybe we should
call it a night

32:13.931 --> 32:15.058
and try this again
tomorrow, huh?

32:15.141 --> 32:16.184
(cell phone ringing)

32:19.812 --> 32:20.730
{\an3}Well,
answer it.

32:20.813 --> 32:21.856
Okay.

32:21.939 --> 32:23.399
(beep)

32:23.483 --> 32:24.859
Hello.

32:24.942 --> 32:26.861
Kelly, it's me.

32:26.944 --> 32:27.862
Colin,

32:27.945 --> 32:29.030
{\an1}I'm so glad
you called back.

32:29.113 --> 32:30.365
{\an1}I've been paging you
all night.

32:30.448 --> 32:32.241
You alone?

32:32.325 --> 32:33.868
Yeah, yeah.

32:33.951 --> 32:35.328
Um, where are you?

32:35.411 --> 32:36.329
Are you okay?

32:36.412 --> 32:37.163
Yeah, I'm fine.

32:37.246 --> 32:39.374
I've had to do
a lot of moving around.

32:39.457 --> 32:42.043
{\an1}Look, I, um,
I have to see you.

32:42.126 --> 32:43.878
I don't know, Kelly.

32:43.961 --> 32:45.213
It's-it's not safe.

32:45.296 --> 32:47.548
Please.

32:53.930 --> 32:55.932
All right.

32:56.015 --> 32:57.225
But not tonight.

32:57.308 --> 32:58.351
Look, I'll call you
tomorrow, okay?

32:58.434 --> 32:59.352
Yeah.

32:59.435 --> 33:00.561
I love you, Kelly.

33:00.645 --> 33:01.854
I need you.

33:01.938 --> 33:03.356
I need you now more than ever.

33:03.439 --> 33:07.026
I need you, too, Colin.

33:07.110 --> 33:09.195
Bye.

33:09.278 --> 33:10.279
(beep)

33:25.086 --> 33:26.087
Hey, Donna.

33:26.170 --> 33:27.255
{\an3}Hi, Wendy.

33:27.338 --> 33:28.631
{\an3}You guys
loading out?

33:28.715 --> 33:31.050
{\an1}Yeah, we have a show in,
uh, San Luis Obispo tonight.

33:31.134 --> 33:33.344
Oh, don't think I got
a chance to tell you,

33:33.428 --> 33:34.595
but the show was
great last night.

33:34.679 --> 33:35.763
{\an3}And I love
the new song.

33:35.847 --> 33:37.348
You know, he wrote that
for you, Donna?

33:37.432 --> 33:40.476
Yeah, I was, I was wondering
about that.

33:40.560 --> 33:41.769
{\an3}WENDY:
Hey, Donna,

33:41.853 --> 33:43.104
thanks for being so nice to us.

33:43.187 --> 33:44.981
It was really great meeting you.
You made this

33:45.064 --> 33:46.232
a real special homecoming
for Ray.

33:46.315 --> 33:47.233
{\an6}DONNA:
Well, we're
all real happy

33:47.316 --> 33:48.943
Thanks. guys.

33:49.026 --> 33:50.903
Uh, I'm gonna go see what's left
in the dressing room.

33:50.987 --> 33:51.779
{\an3}Okay.

33:51.863 --> 33:53.239
See you lOkay.

33:56.868 --> 33:58.411
{\an3}Wendy,
Wendy's great.

33:58.494 --> 34:00.997
Yeah, I know, she is.

34:01.080 --> 34:02.957
{\an1}Look, I owe you
a lot, Donna.

34:03.040 --> 34:05.042
Well, let's just make
a great video together

34:05.126 --> 34:06.961
and call it even.
(chuckles)

34:07.044 --> 34:07.795
You got a deal.

34:07.879 --> 34:10.465
I just hope
you're as happy as I am.

34:10.547 --> 34:12.550
Nobody deserves it
more than you do.

34:12.632 --> 34:14.510
{\an1}I hope you have
all the happiness

34:14.594 --> 34:16.012
{\an1}in the world,
Donna, I mean that.

34:16.094 --> 34:18.473
Especially after
what I did to you.

34:18.556 --> 34:21.809
Thanks.

34:21.893 --> 34:25.103
I, uh, I really needed
to hear that right now.

34:31.444 --> 34:32.987
(phone ringing)

34:33.070 --> 34:34.112
Hello.

34:34.197 --> 34:35.447
It's me.

34:35.531 --> 34:37.449
I'm at the Palm Court Motel.

34:37.533 --> 34:38.784
It's, uh, it's in Reseda.

34:38.868 --> 34:40.203
I'm in room 106.

34:40.286 --> 34:41.661
I'll be waiting for you here.

34:41.746 --> 34:43.748
Hang on, hang on,
let me write it...

34:47.918 --> 34:49.629
Okay, the Palm Court,

34:49.712 --> 34:50.713
106.

34:50.797 --> 34:53.007
Yeah. Look, how long
will it take you to get here?

34:53.090 --> 34:54.717
Uh, a few hours.

34:54.801 --> 34:55.967
Is there a problem?

34:56.052 --> 34:57.220
Yeah. Just come right now.

34:57.303 --> 35:00.306
I can't, Colin, I have a-a few
things I have to finish up here.

35:00.389 --> 35:01.516
Like what?

35:01.599 --> 35:03.351
Uh, I-I have
a doctor's appointment.

35:03.434 --> 35:04.811
I'll be there as soon as I can.

35:04.894 --> 35:06.020
Just hurry.

35:06.103 --> 35:07.021
I will.

35:07.105 --> 35:08.022
Kelly.

35:08.105 --> 35:10.483
What?

35:10.566 --> 35:11.526
Can I trust you?

35:11.609 --> 35:13.653
Of course you can.

35:13.736 --> 35:14.821
See you soon.

35:22.245 --> 35:25.164
{\an1}And to show my gratitude
to the two of you

35:25.248 --> 35:26.916
{\an1}for bearing with me
through my mumbling time,

35:26.999 --> 35:29.168
I'd like
to pay for lunch.

35:29.252 --> 35:31.838
{\an1}I thought I heard the familiar
sound of gums flapping!

35:31.921 --> 35:33.339
Yeah, they're mine.

35:33.422 --> 35:35.550
{\an3}Do me a favor: set us up
with three mega burgers, okay?

35:35.633 --> 35:36.551
You got it, pal.

35:36.634 --> 35:37.844
Thanks.

35:37.927 --> 35:39.846
Okay, let's give
those lips a try.

35:39.929 --> 35:41.305
{\an1}STEVE:
Yeah, that's wise?

35:41.389 --> 35:42.515
the kisser's still
a little sore.

35:42.598 --> 35:43.724
{\an3}I'll be the
judge of that.

35:43.808 --> 35:45.101
Okay.

35:45.184 --> 35:46.102
Mmm.

35:46.185 --> 35:47.270
{\an3}Is that where
it hurts?

35:47.353 --> 35:49.105
{\an1}Yeah, but I think
we're back in business.

35:54.694 --> 35:56.237
KELLY:
<i>I hate this.</i>

35:56.320 --> 35:57.405
I feel like such a snitch.

35:57.488 --> 36:00.116
Come on, Kel, it's not like
the guy cheated on a test.

36:00.199 --> 36:01.534
{\an3}I thought you didn't care
about him anyway.

36:01.617 --> 36:03.411
I don't, but still.

36:03.494 --> 36:04.620
Here we go.

36:05.663 --> 36:06.622
DANNY:
Hey!

36:06.706 --> 36:07.957
{\an6}RENDELL:
We'd like to
talk to you.

36:08.040 --> 36:09.458
Hey, lock my door.

36:09.542 --> 36:10.751
{\an3}Wait, that's
not Colin.

36:10.835 --> 36:11.919
{\an1}RENDELL:
Take it easy now.

36:12.003 --> 36:12.962
You have the right

36:13.045 --> 36:14.422
to speak to an attorney.

36:14.505 --> 36:16.549
DANNY:
I don't need to hear my rights.

36:16.632 --> 36:17.550
What'd I do?

36:17.633 --> 36:19.051
{\an4}RENDELL:
What were you doing
in that room, huh?

36:19.135 --> 36:20.428
I'm staying here.

36:20.511 --> 36:21.429
Check the register.

36:21.512 --> 36:24.265
Danny Fivinsky, all right?

36:24.348 --> 36:25.224
If you don't let go of me,

36:25.308 --> 36:26.809
you're gonna have a lawsuit
on your hands.

36:26.893 --> 36:28.102
I want you to know that.

36:28.185 --> 36:29.437
Where's Colin?

36:29.520 --> 36:30.438
Who's Colin?

36:30.521 --> 36:31.564
What are you talking about?

36:32.690 --> 36:33.941
Who are these people?

36:34.025 --> 36:35.443
YKELLY:w
thiYes.y?

36:35.526 --> 36:36.736
{\an3}He-he's a
drug dealer.

36:36.819 --> 36:38.404
{\an3}That's how I got
Colin's beeper number.

36:38.487 --> 36:40.990
{\an1}I never seen this girl
before in my life.

36:41.073 --> 36:43.284
{\an6}RENDELL:
You're coming
with us, pal.

36:43.367 --> 36:44.952
Fine, no problem.

36:45.036 --> 36:46.829
I got nothing to hide.

36:49.040 --> 36:51.042
Colin knew.

36:51.125 --> 36:52.501
He saw right through me.

36:52.585 --> 36:53.961
Danny told him
and set us up.

36:54.045 --> 36:55.922
{\an3}Now, you can bet if
Danny was in that motel room,

36:56.005 --> 36:57.298
Colin ain't far off.

36:57.381 --> 36:59.300
{\an1}Well, maybe the police
will have some luck

36:59.383 --> 37:00.635
{\an1}when they put
the pressure on him.

37:00.718 --> 37:02.303
No way.

37:02.386 --> 37:03.804
He knew we had nothing on him.

37:03.888 --> 37:06.766
This was our one chance,
and we blew it.

37:06.849 --> 37:08.309
What did you say
to Colin anyways?

37:08.392 --> 37:10.269
You cVal, she did been
tooher best.ng.

37:10.353 --> 37:11.771
I don't need you
to defend me, Brandon.

37:11.854 --> 37:13.689
Let's go.

37:23.783 --> 37:26.327
{\an1}I didn't get much sleep
last night.

37:26.410 --> 37:28.496
No, neither did I.

37:28.579 --> 37:32.166
The one thing...

37:32.250 --> 37:35.378
that I know for sure...

37:35.461 --> 37:38.839
is how much I love you.

37:38.923 --> 37:40.925
And I love you, too.

37:44.387 --> 37:46.055
But there's a
"but" coming.

37:51.102 --> 37:54.563
I'm just not ready yet.

37:54.647 --> 37:56.440
I mean, we're both so young.

37:56.524 --> 38:00.027
My mother was 19
when she got married.

38:00.111 --> 38:02.363
Yeah.

38:02.446 --> 38:04.573
My mom was young, too.

38:07.326 --> 38:09.245
She got pregnant.

38:09.328 --> 38:11.372
She...

38:11.455 --> 38:15.084
She had to get married.

38:15.167 --> 38:17.795
She lost the baby.

38:17.878 --> 38:20.881
{\an1}And even though her and my dad
worked things out...

38:23.426 --> 38:25.177
I know she still wonders

38:25.261 --> 38:26.846
{\an1}what she could have done
with her life.

38:26.929 --> 38:28.723
It wouldn't be that way with us.

38:29.765 --> 38:31.726
Maybe not.

38:34.979 --> 38:37.231
But I...

38:37.315 --> 38:39.025
I'm not ready
to leave my friends,

38:39.108 --> 38:40.609
say good-bye

38:40.693 --> 38:42.737
to my family...

38:45.364 --> 38:48.743
give up the few years of freedom

38:48.826 --> 38:51.245
we all have left
before we have to grow up.

38:51.328 --> 38:53.122
{\an1}I mean,
I still have

38:53.205 --> 38:56.125
so many dreams
that I haven't even tried

38:56.208 --> 38:58.252
to make come true yet.

39:00.880 --> 39:04.258
And I don't want to go with you

39:04.341 --> 39:06.927
and wonder what my life
might have been like.

39:07.011 --> 39:09.096
{\an1}You'd wind up
hating me.

39:11.057 --> 39:13.225
Can you understand that?

39:18.522 --> 39:19.607
Yeah.

39:24.570 --> 39:26.614
I still wish I could
change your mind.

39:28.574 --> 39:31.243
Well, maybe I can change yours.

39:31.327 --> 39:32.787
{\an1}I mean,

39:32.870 --> 39:39.001
if I asked you to stay here,
here with me, would you?

39:45.382 --> 39:47.426
Uh... no.

39:49.386 --> 39:50.137
I can't.

39:50.221 --> 39:53.265
I've got to chase
my dreams, too.

39:57.228 --> 39:58.979
So when are you gonna
go back home?

39:59.063 --> 40:02.316
They asked for me to be out of
the dorm by the end of the week.

40:02.399 --> 40:05.027
(sniffles)

40:06.070 --> 40:08.239
I'm gonna miss you, Donna.

40:10.324 --> 40:11.534
I'm gonna miss you, too.

40:14.078 --> 40:15.996
This is the part
that I'm not really sure

40:16.080 --> 40:17.123
what we're supposed to do.

40:17.206 --> 40:18.207
(chuckles)

40:20.876 --> 40:23.838
It's over; I guess this is
where we say good-bye.

40:23.921 --> 40:26.715
No.

40:26.799 --> 40:29.844
It's just the beginning.

40:29.927 --> 40:30.845
For both of us.

40:30.928 --> 40:32.596
(chuckles)

40:41.397 --> 40:42.898
Can I kiss you one last time?

40:42.982 --> 40:44.024
You don't have to ask.
