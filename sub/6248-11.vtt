<i># [Ends]</i>

00:38.138 --> 00:42.837
<i>Mr. Addy,</i>
<i>your dissertation is entitled...</i>

00:42.909 --> 00:45.503
"Analysis of Bone Trauma."

00:45.578 --> 00:49.173
When viewed in cross section,
the pressure and force...

00:49.249 --> 00:51.513
<i>exerted by the weapon can be assessed.</i>

00:51.584 --> 00:54.815
Obtaining the cross section
will compromise the original bone.

00:54.888 --> 00:57.652
My technique preserves
bone surface morphology...

00:57.724 --> 00:59.954
through the use
of polyvinyl replication.

01:00.026 --> 01:03.325
<i>A transparent positive is made</i>
<i>by covering the impression...</i>

01:03.396 --> 01:05.330
<i>with an aqueous solution</i>
<i>of synthetic polymer.</i>

01:05.397 --> 01:08.663
Hey, Bones. Come on. We got a body.
Went up like a Roman candle.

01:08.735 --> 01:12.034
- Hey, Zack. How's it going?
- So far, they don't like me.

01:12.105 --> 01:14.266
- Shocker. Let's go.
- <i>[Brennan] I'm in the middle of something.</i>

01:14.340 --> 01:18.674
<i>You know, real-life murder and mutilation</i>
<i>versus academic claptrap, no contest.</i>

01:18.745 --> 01:22.647
- Sorry. No offense.
- This committee can carry on
without you, Dr. Brennan.

01:22.715 --> 01:25.946
- Zack, just answer the questions.
- [Booth] Yeah.

01:26.019 --> 01:27.816
[Booth]
Okay, come on.

01:32.258 --> 01:34.192
Next question?

01:34.260 --> 01:36.922
How do you expect anyone
to take you seriously...

01:36.996 --> 01:39.362
as a working forensic anthropologist...

01:39.432 --> 01:42.833
when you look the way you do?

01:42.902 --> 01:44.836
What?

01:46.339 --> 01:49.240
- <i>[Brennan] Male, middle-aged.</i>
- <i>What was with Zack back there?</i>

01:49.309 --> 01:52.836
Defending his dissertation.
Last step before he gets his doctorate.

01:52.912 --> 01:55.813
I think these are what's left
of his intestines.

01:55.882 --> 01:59.340
- Is he gonna make it?
- No. He's very dead. [Chuckles]

01:59.419 --> 02:02.388
- I mean Zack.
- Ah, 50-50.

02:02.455 --> 02:04.616
- He's a stoolie.
- Zack?

02:04.691 --> 02:06.784
Our victim.
No, he's a rat, a snitch.

02:06.860 --> 02:09.226
- What makes you say that?
- His guts got spilled.

02:09.294 --> 02:11.729
- <i>You know, spill your guts.</i>
- <i>Very literal.</i>

02:11.798 --> 02:16.497
Hung up there like a scarecrow on a rooftop of
a hotel used to house witnesses. It's a warning.

02:16.569 --> 02:19.902
There's something jammed
down his trachea.

02:19.973 --> 02:23.875
<i>[Zack] I rectified their erroneous assumptions</i>
<i>concerning polyvinyl replication.</i>

02:23.943 --> 02:26.343
You corrected them?

02:26.412 --> 02:28.346
- Only when they were wrong.
- [Chuckles]

02:28.414 --> 02:30.348
Are the remains
ready for X-ray?

02:30.416 --> 02:32.782
Yes. Maybe we'll get lucky and I.D.
the poor bastard that way.

02:32.852 --> 02:37.084
<i>Oh, wejust got lucky.</i>

02:37.157 --> 02:40.285
"My name is Garrett Delaney."

02:40.360 --> 02:42.954
<i>There's something metallic here.</i>

02:45.431 --> 02:49.299
<i>This is gonna turn out to be some</i>
<i>freaky, weird ritualistic thing, isn't it?</i>

02:49.369 --> 02:51.303
Oh, man, I hope so.

02:51.371 --> 02:54.534
Christopher Columbus.

02:54.607 --> 02:57.405
- Where's Dr. Brennan?
- Her brother came for a visit.

02:57.477 --> 03:00.605
Dad called you?
You're sure it was him?

03:00.680 --> 03:03.410
He said, " You and your sister
are in danger," and he hung up.

03:03.483 --> 03:07.886
I spend half my time with a sniper-trained
F.B.I. agent. I feel safe.

03:07.954 --> 03:09.979
Tempe, I know someone
is watching me.

03:10.056 --> 03:12.820
- What's your evidence?
- I can feel it on the back of my neck.

03:12.892 --> 03:15.952
You spend some time in jail,
you develop a sixth sense.

03:19.666 --> 03:22.658
- Maybe you should stay with me for a few days.
- Tempe, I have work.

03:22.735 --> 03:26.432
- I have Amy and the girls.
- What about your sixth sense?

03:26.506 --> 03:28.167
- Hey!
- What?

03:28.241 --> 03:30.402
You can't not believe
in something one second...

03:30.476 --> 03:32.944
- <i>and then use it against me in the next.</i>
- It's a long drive.

03:33.012 --> 03:35.674
<i>You could start fresh tomorrow.</i>
<i>And I've got...</i>

03:35.748 --> 03:38.478
cold beer in the fridge.

03:38.551 --> 03:40.849
Don't drink the Moroccan beer.
Tastes like ear wax. How you doing, Russell?

03:40.920 --> 03:43.684
- Okay, Booth. You? Good?
- Yeah. Good.

03:46.125 --> 03:48.650
I still make him nervous, don't I?
Come on. Let's go.

03:48.728 --> 03:50.923
Why do I always feel
like you're abducting me?

03:50.997 --> 03:54.296
<i>[Booth] Yeah. It turns out our corpse</i>
<i>is a former F.B.I. agent.</i>

03:54.367 --> 03:57.359
<i>Garrett Delaney, he left the F.B.I.</i>
<i>about 15 years ago.</i>

03:57.437 --> 04:00.895
He's now head of security of
some big K Street lobbyist.

04:00.974 --> 04:02.839
So why'd he end up
a human torch?

04:02.909 --> 04:05.309
That's what we're here
to find out.

04:05.378 --> 04:09.678
His place is much better than yours.
Ten times better.

04:09.749 --> 04:11.717
<i>I told you he left public service.</i>

04:11.784 --> 04:15.948
He makes, uh, more money than I.

04:16.022 --> 04:18.286
<i>So that's all your dad said, huh?</i>

04:18.358 --> 04:20.849
- <i>Is you're in danger?</i>
- Yes.

04:20.927 --> 04:23.657
- And Russ's sixth sense agrees.
- What are you doing?

04:23.730 --> 04:27.689
I've been practicing some
of the black ops stuff you taught me.

04:27.767 --> 04:29.701
Let me show you.

04:29.769 --> 04:32.135
<i>Every F.B.I. agent in the country</i>
<i>is looking for my father.</i>

04:32.205 --> 04:33.797
Maybe he's trying
to scare us off.

04:33.873 --> 04:36.569
Six months without a break
in the case, he ain't gonna be nervous.

04:36.643 --> 04:38.907
- Now let me show you.
- My dad's a career criminal.

04:38.978 --> 04:40.912
Just because he says that Russ
is in danger doesn't mean it's the truth.

04:40.980 --> 04:43.881
Let me show you how it's done, okay?
[Kicks Door]

04:47.453 --> 04:50.820
Oh. He might've
gotten it right this time.

04:55.461 --> 04:59.022
<i>[Brennan]</i>
<i>Russ.</i>

04:59.098 --> 05:01.931
<i>These are all pictures of Russ.</i>

05:37.470 --> 05:41.497
<i>Me at work, me and Amy.</i>
<i>This was the day before yesterday.</i>

05:41.574 --> 05:43.633
Dad was right.
Somebody's watching.

05:43.710 --> 05:45.905
- This is worse than watching.
- What do you mean?

05:45.978 --> 05:47.605
- This is hunting.
- Hunting?

05:47.680 --> 05:50.649
As in kill. You see these?

05:50.717 --> 05:54.881
Right here. These are ranges. He's picking out
a spot from which to shoot at you.

05:54.954 --> 05:58.720
- So what do I do now?
- The hunter's dead. The hunt is over, right?

05:58.791 --> 06:01.021
- Anyone else know you're here?
- Only Amy.

06:01.094 --> 06:03.585
Great. Call Amy and tell her
if anyone calls looking for you...

06:03.663 --> 06:05.494
<i>she doesn't know where you're at.</i>

06:05.565 --> 06:10.434
<i>You should stay with me until we find out</i>
<i>why Delaney intended to kill you.</i>

06:10.503 --> 06:13.802
- How are you gonna do that?
- By figuring out who killed him.

06:19.979 --> 06:22.709
<i>[Angela] This is the paper that was</i>
<i>pulled from Delaney's throat.</i>

06:22.782 --> 06:26.946
<i>It was dated, signed, and initialed</i>
<i>at the bottom ofboth sides of the page.</i>

06:27.019 --> 06:30.045
February 1978.

06:30.123 --> 06:32.182
It looks like a cop's notebook.

06:32.258 --> 06:35.125
- That makes sense except...
- <i>[Typing]</i>

06:35.194 --> 06:39.927
<i>"I will not put an innocent man in prison</i>
<i>just because he is a political threat.</i>

06:39.999 --> 06:42.934
Marvin Beckett hasn't
broken any law."

06:43.002 --> 06:46.130
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Marvin Beckett?

06:46.205 --> 06:48.935
Back in the '60s, Marvin
Beckett was a civil rights activist.

06:49.008 --> 06:50.942
He made his bones protesting...

06:51.010 --> 06:53.308
African American overrepresentation
in the Vietnam War.

06:53.379 --> 06:57.281
- In '78, he was sent to prison for life.
- Why?

06:57.350 --> 06:59.375
He killed an F.B.I. agent
named Gus Harper.

06:59.452 --> 07:03.821
- Wait. Augustus Harper?
- Yeah. You know the case?

07:03.890 --> 07:07.621
<i>"A ugust Harp."</i>
<i>Look. Augustus Harper.</i>

07:07.693 --> 07:09.388
Oh, wow.

07:09.462 --> 07:11.760
<i>This means Delaney's murder</i>
<i>has something to do...</i>

07:11.831 --> 07:13.822
<i>with Marvin Beckett</i>
<i>going to prison.</i>

07:15.701 --> 07:18.795
Oh, when you're good,
you are very, very good.

07:18.871 --> 07:20.839
1970s, Ohio.

07:20.907 --> 07:24.172
There is a task force made up
of F.B.I., state police, and local cops.

07:24.243 --> 07:28.043
It goes bad. Starts taking a cut from the same
bank robbers they're supposed to be catching.

07:28.114 --> 07:32.050
Then they conspire to plan a stack
of stolen money on Marvin Beckett.

07:32.118 --> 07:34.450
Well, then this young agent,
right, Harper, okay?

07:34.520 --> 07:37.580
He decides he can't live with that
and decides to blow the whistle.

07:37.657 --> 07:40.626
- I can read.
- The same guy who's gonna blow
the whistle on them...

07:40.693 --> 07:43.389
for framing Marvin Beckett
then gets murdered by Marvin Beckett?

07:43.463 --> 07:45.454
Come on. Talk about
killing two birds with one stone.

07:45.531 --> 07:48.125
- Who else knows about this?
- Us and you. That's it.

07:48.201 --> 07:50.829
- Let's keep it that way.
- Hey, I've seen this movie.

07:50.903 --> 07:53.736
- I get killed on the way home.
- Then don't go home.

07:53.806 --> 07:56.036
[Chuckles]
You serious?

07:56.242 --> 08:00.269
Thirty years ago, I was married
to Gus Harper for exactly eight months.

08:00.346 --> 08:02.439
I'm not sure I can help you.

08:02.515 --> 08:04.915
What about the contents of the note?

08:04.984 --> 08:07.680
What do you people want?

08:07.753 --> 08:09.687
The truth.

08:09.755 --> 08:12.849
The last time the F.B.I.
came to talk to me...

08:12.925 --> 08:15.257
they told me to keep
my mouth shut...

08:15.328 --> 08:18.126
<i>or you won't get</i>
<i>your husband's death benefits.</i>

08:18.197 --> 08:20.791
Your husband is a good man.
And he tried to do the right thing.

08:20.867 --> 08:24.860
And he ended up dead.
I can't let that stand.

08:30.710 --> 08:35.113
The F.B.I. murdered Gus.

08:35.181 --> 08:37.945
Then they had
a state funeral for him...

08:38.017 --> 08:41.453
complete with
the grieving widow as a centerpiece.

08:43.222 --> 08:46.817
Is this your husband's handwriting?

08:46.893 --> 08:50.795
Yes. He was compiling evidence.

08:50.863 --> 08:53.388
- And there was more?
- <i>There was a diary...</i>

08:53.466 --> 08:55.798
a dozen audiotapes, field notes.

08:55.868 --> 08:59.065
- And where did Gus keep it?
- Safety-deposit box.

08:59.138 --> 09:01.834
Can you tell us where
that safety-deposit box was?

09:01.908 --> 09:04.468
Ohio First Savings and Loan in Dayton.

09:10.383 --> 09:13.011
Excuse me one moment.

09:17.523 --> 09:20.014
My parents robbed
that exact bank...

09:20.092 --> 09:24.461
just days after
Gus Harper was killed.

09:24.530 --> 09:26.657
They were looking
for that evidence.

09:26.732 --> 09:30.361
That has to be why Delaney
was stalking Russ.

09:30.436 --> 09:33.803
Go home. I have a few more questions
for Barbara Harper, okay?

09:33.873 --> 09:36.808
You go home and you be
with your brother, all right?

09:36.876 --> 09:38.468
Okay.

09:39.912 --> 09:41.812
Okay.

09:41.881 --> 09:45.783
- You think it's Delaney?
- <i>[Zack] Definitely.</i>

09:45.851 --> 09:48.547
I hope to keep working here
when I receive my doctorate.

09:48.621 --> 09:50.555
We'd all like that.

09:50.623 --> 09:54.024
What did she mean when she said, " How do
you expect anyone to take you seriously?"

09:54.093 --> 09:57.722
It's a comment on...

09:57.797 --> 09:59.731
your deportment.

09:59.799 --> 10:02.393
Dr. Brennan doesn't
care about deportment.

10:02.468 --> 10:04.595
That's true.

10:04.670 --> 10:09.004
But if you work here, you won't be
Brennan's grad student anymore.

10:09.075 --> 10:11.703
<i>You'll be a full-blown</i>
<i>forensic anthropologist.</i>

10:11.777 --> 10:13.540
Cam will be your boss.

10:13.613 --> 10:16.480
In your opinion, does
deportment matter to Cam?

10:16.549 --> 10:19.882
Let's just say that Cam's not
the kind of woman you catch...

10:19.952 --> 10:22.386
<i>with crusties</i>
<i>in the corner ofher eye.</i>

10:26.425 --> 10:28.586
Haley's six, and Emma's eight.

10:32.832 --> 10:35.062
Tempe?

10:35.134 --> 10:37.068
I'm sorry.

10:37.136 --> 10:39.070
Preoccupied.

10:39.138 --> 10:41.072
Tempe, if I play my cards right...

10:41.140 --> 10:44.109
these little girls are gonna be your nieces
in the next couple months.

10:44.176 --> 10:46.508
<i>The least you can do</i>
<i>is memorize their names.</i>

10:49.915 --> 10:51.974
- They're cute.
- Haley has lung trouble.

10:52.051 --> 10:55.111
They're trying to figure it out.
You ever deal with an H.M. O?

10:55.187 --> 10:58.247
- If it's money, Russ, I can help.
- <i>No, forget it.</i>

10:58.324 --> 11:01.691
If I'm gonna become these little girls' daddy,
I gotta man up for the job.

11:01.761 --> 11:04.628
- <i>[Knocking]</i>
- That's not rational.

11:04.697 --> 11:06.961
<i>I'm a good mechanic.</i>
<i>I'll take care of my own.</i>

11:08.200 --> 11:11.294
Gus Harper's service history.
Okay?

11:11.370 --> 11:13.668
Graduated top half of his class
in Quantico.

11:13.739 --> 11:18.642
He was assigned to theJoint State-Federal
Bank Robbery Task Force. Right there.

11:18.711 --> 11:22.909
- The victim.
- Back when he was Special Agent
Delaney supervising Gus Harper.

11:22.982 --> 11:25.109
- The guy that was hunting me?
- <i>That's right.</i>

11:25.184 --> 11:28.551
Okay, here's a list of the bank robbers
with their F.B.I. code names.

11:28.621 --> 11:31.613
<i>[Brennan]</i>
<i>Dad's code name was Columbus.</i>

11:31.691 --> 11:34.319
Yeah. Lewis, Clark...

11:34.393 --> 11:37.988
Magellan, Cook, Columbus.

11:38.064 --> 11:39.964
All named after explorers.

11:40.032 --> 11:42.432
That's Mom and Dad.

11:42.501 --> 11:45.595
- Every one of these people are deceased.
- Except for Dad.

11:45.671 --> 11:48.799
Delaney was killed to send
a message to the F.B.I.

11:48.874 --> 11:53.072
This Columbus coin was found
in the victim's mouth.

11:53.145 --> 11:55.841
Columbus shot a man
in the head...

11:55.915 --> 11:58.179
hung him from a pole...

11:58.250 --> 12:00.912
gutted him,
and set him on fire.

12:04.790 --> 12:07.987
And Columbus is our father.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.672
<i>[Russ]</i>
<i>Dad had it under control.</i>

12:20.740 --> 12:25.040
- I mean, for 15 years everything was fine until...
- Until what?

12:25.111 --> 12:28.103
Dad left you a message.
He said, "Stop looking." You didn't.

12:28.180 --> 12:30.341
So this is my fault?

12:30.416 --> 12:33.112
Well, consequences
aren't the same as fault.

12:33.185 --> 12:35.710
My parole officer
is very philosophical.

12:35.788 --> 12:39.986
Well, all we have is a voice tape
of Dad saying, "Back off"...

12:40.059 --> 12:44.257
and a little silver dolphin
that I found at Mom's grave.

12:44.330 --> 12:46.798
That's as far as
the investigation has gone.

12:46.866 --> 12:49.494
- According to Booth.
- What? Booth and I are partners.

12:49.568 --> 12:51.559
Tempe, he's F.B.I.
You aren't.

12:51.637 --> 12:55.767
You're the daughter of a career criminal
and the sister of a loser on parole.

12:55.841 --> 12:57.832
What?

12:57.910 --> 13:00.401
I wouldn't let anyone else
call you a loser, Russ.

13:00.479 --> 13:02.743
What makes you think
you're allowed?

13:02.815 --> 13:04.749
I love you too.

13:07.419 --> 13:10.752
What you're asking is the kind
of thing that destroys careers.

13:10.823 --> 13:13.690
From the time I was a little girl,
I dreamed of putting bad men in jail.

13:13.759 --> 13:17.490
Put that back. Which is why I became
an Assistant United States Attorney.

13:17.563 --> 13:20.088
- You don't have to help me.
- Of course I have to help you!

13:20.166 --> 13:23.101
Marvin Beckett is still a hero
to a lot of African Americans.

13:23.169 --> 13:25.603
Some of us never believed
he killed this F.B.I. boy.

13:25.671 --> 13:29.004
Now you buy me breakfast, tell me you
found a way to clear his name...

13:29.074 --> 13:31.907
release him out of wrongful incarceration
after 30 years?

13:31.977 --> 13:34.104
I cannot walk away,
which you already know!

13:34.180 --> 13:36.546
- Maybe you should have some more coffee.
- Of course I want more coffee.

13:36.615 --> 13:39.379
- We have to come up with our plan of attack.
- I was thinking Judge Moran...

13:39.451 --> 13:43.353
We should exhume Gus Harper.
See if your genius scientist partner...

13:43.422 --> 13:47.290
can ascertain whether he died in the manner
the F.B.I. said he died 30 years ago.

13:47.359 --> 13:49.953
- Moran's got a long...
- No. We want Kemper.

13:50.029 --> 13:55.057
- "Hang 'em High" Kemper?
- I'm ruining my career,
I'm doing it my way, understand?

13:55.134 --> 13:58.729
<i>Now, take a doughnut hole.</i>
<i>I'm offering.</i>

14:00.873 --> 14:03.569
Thanks.

14:03.642 --> 14:06.668
This was lodged in Garrett
Delaney's sinus cavity.

14:06.745 --> 14:09.043
.22 caliber.

14:09.114 --> 14:13.983
These dimples indicate that the bullet
ricocheted around inside the cranium.

14:14.053 --> 14:16.146
Are you worried
about your doctorate?

14:16.222 --> 14:20.818
No. Dr. Grayson touched me
with an open hand on the shoulder.

14:20.893 --> 14:22.827
You mean inappropriately?

14:22.895 --> 14:24.988
No. I read a book
on body language.

14:25.064 --> 14:28.227
<i>Apparently in our culture, when an older male</i>
<i>lays an open hand on a younger male...</i>

14:28.300 --> 14:30.234
it conveys approval.

14:30.302 --> 14:34.739
But if he bumps younger male
with a closed fist, it conveys doubt.

14:34.807 --> 14:39.574
Dr. Grayson went like this,
not like this.

14:41.480 --> 14:43.448
Like this.

14:44.483 --> 14:46.417
Not like this.

14:48.020 --> 14:50.488
Dr. Grayson is elderly and arthritic.

14:50.556 --> 14:53.855
Perhaps he simply needed help
getting to his feet like this.

14:53.926 --> 14:58.363
<i>Dr. Brennan, visitors in your office.</i>

15:04.370 --> 15:06.600
Tempe, this is a friend of Dad's.

15:06.672 --> 15:11.336
<i>Father Coulter is Toby Coulter,</i>
<i>train trestle guy.</i>

15:11.410 --> 15:13.810
Oh, yeah.
I remember that story.

15:13.879 --> 15:17.212
When Dad and his friend accidentally
blew up a train trestle.

15:17.283 --> 15:19.615
Come on. How do you accidentally
blow up a train trestle?

15:19.685 --> 15:24.019
<i>Well, we were hired by a farmer</i>
<i>to dynamite the ice offhis stock pond.</i>

15:24.089 --> 15:26.523
<i>We get this competition going</i>
<i>who's gonna slide the dynamite...</i>

15:26.592 --> 15:28.685
farther across the ice
before it blows.

15:28.761 --> 15:31.628
<i>You know it's a federal offense</i>
<i>to blow up a train trestle, Father.</i>

15:31.697 --> 15:33.756
I mean, even if it is accidental.

15:33.832 --> 15:37.563
Father Toby Coulter,
meet my partner, Seeley Booth.

15:37.636 --> 15:40.571
- Careful. He's F.B.I.
- Ooh. Well, I'm innocent.

15:40.639 --> 15:43.164
It was Max's toss that brought
the trestle down.

15:43.242 --> 15:46.302
<i>Max Keenan's best friend</i>
<i>grows up to be a priest.</i>

15:46.378 --> 15:49.074
I'm sure your people have
that fact on file somewhere.

15:49.148 --> 15:52.640
Tempe, Father Coulter
has a message from Dad.

15:52.718 --> 15:54.583
It's a private message.

15:54.653 --> 15:57.053
Come to my office.

16:01.327 --> 16:05.229
She's just gonna tell Agent Booth anyway.
Might as well let him listen.

16:07.399 --> 16:10.061
"Back off."
That's the message.

16:10.135 --> 16:12.933
- <i>He said you'd understand.</i>
- <i>[Booth] Where'd you see him?</i>

16:13.005 --> 16:16.406
- In confession.
- We're not Catholic.

16:16.475 --> 16:20.605
Oh, the sanctity of the confessional
is extended to all.

16:20.679 --> 16:22.772
Um, did he ever call you
on your cell phone, Father?

16:22.848 --> 16:24.873
Two days ago.

16:24.950 --> 16:28.078
- <i>Can I see your phone?</i>
- You want to trace the call?

16:28.153 --> 16:30.747
Yeah.

16:30.823 --> 16:34.884
<i>So, uh, Max Keenan,</i>
<i>he come to you for absolution?</i>

16:34.960 --> 16:37.019
Well, I'm sure you know
the requirements for confession.

16:37.096 --> 16:39.530
Contrition and intent
not to repeat the sin.

16:39.598 --> 16:43.762
<i>And Max doesn't have either.</i>
<i>And as a priest, I failed him.</i>

16:43.836 --> 16:46.532
I never was able to get him
to walk the straight and narrow.

16:46.605 --> 16:48.698
Is there anything else
you can tell us?

16:48.774 --> 16:51.971
Well, he was angry.
He felt his hand had been forced.

16:52.044 --> 16:53.978
<i>Where can we reach you, Father?</i>

16:54.046 --> 16:56.037
Father Coulter's staying
at St. Augustine Seminary...

16:56.115 --> 16:58.049
for the next few days
before heading back to Ohio.

16:58.117 --> 17:00.551
Here, Father.

17:00.619 --> 17:02.917
Your father loves you.

17:02.988 --> 17:05.080
Is that part of Dad's message?

17:05.156 --> 17:08.058
That's a personal observation.

17:19.704 --> 17:21.969
<i>[Booth]</i>
<i>Delaney's murder, the threats on Russ's life...</i>

17:22.040 --> 17:24.907
<i>this is all happening now</i>
<i>because of a little metal dolphin...</i>

17:24.977 --> 17:27.444
we found on your mother's grave.

17:27.512 --> 17:31.313
F.B.I. field unit in Denver traced it
to a local artist in Mead, Colorado.

17:31.383 --> 17:33.647
Who identified Dad as the buyer.

17:33.719 --> 17:36.153
But Delaney left the F.B.I.
15 years ago.

17:36.221 --> 17:38.917
- And somebody told him about your dad.
- And didn't tell you?

17:38.991 --> 17:41.289
- They're part of the conspiracy.
- You must be annoyed.

17:41.360 --> 17:43.521
You know what? I am.
And I don't like finding out...

17:43.595 --> 17:46.723
there's a dirty F.B.I. agent
in this building.

17:49.134 --> 17:51.659
Here's what I think happened.
Delaney goes to your father.

17:51.737 --> 17:53.898
He asks him to hand over
the evidence.

17:53.972 --> 17:56.372
He doesn't do it,
he kills you or Russ.

17:56.442 --> 17:59.002
Dad calls Russ to warn him.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.012
And then kills Delaney.

18:01.080 --> 18:04.049
Guts him, burns him,
leaves a calling card.

18:04.116 --> 18:06.107
Don't mess with
Max Keenan's kids.

18:06.185 --> 18:08.779
Am I supposed to like that?

18:08.854 --> 18:13.917
No, Bones. I'll take a stand-up crook over
a crooked cop any day of the week.

18:13.992 --> 18:16.825
<i>Booth, I got us a meet</i>
<i>with thejudge. Let's go.</i>

18:16.895 --> 18:20.058
And you better get back to your lab
in case we're successful.

18:20.132 --> 18:24.193
- I just find it best to do what she says.
- Okay.

18:24.403 --> 18:28.305
<i>You want to exhume the young F.B.I. agent</i>
<i>that Marvin Beckett murdered?</i>

18:28.373 --> 18:30.307
That's correct, Your Honor.

18:30.375 --> 18:34.402
- That is a big, noisy mess in the making.
- <i>[Door Opens]</i>

18:34.480 --> 18:39.816
<i>The F.B.I. has credible evidence that the homicide</i>
<i>case against Marvin Beckett was manufactured.</i>

18:39.885 --> 18:43.821
<i>Assistant United States Attorney Dan Burridge</i>
<i>arguing against this writ, Judge Kemper.</i>

18:43.889 --> 18:46.187
- On behalf of...
- The F.B.I.

18:46.258 --> 18:48.818
- I thought you were F.B. I?
- I am, Your Honor.

18:48.894 --> 18:51.727
I told you.
A big, noisy mess.

18:51.797 --> 18:55.164
<i>All right. Let's hear your argument,</i>
<i>Mr. Burridge.</i>

18:55.234 --> 18:58.260
This is a precipitant exhumation
in a highly inflammatory case.

18:58.337 --> 19:01.397
The evidence to which Miss Julian
alludes has not been authenticated.

19:01.473 --> 19:04.340
It has been authenticated
by theJeffersonian Institution.

19:04.409 --> 19:07.378
The F.B.I. would like to do their own
in-house analysis before proceeding.

19:07.446 --> 19:10.438
Of course they would. They're the ones
who did the framing 30 years ago.

19:10.516 --> 19:13.349
- I take exception to that.
- <i>Why? You weren't even born 30 years ago.</i>

19:13.418 --> 19:15.682
- Judge...
- Not like me and Judge Kemper...

19:15.754 --> 19:18.882
<i>who got to see firsthand</i>
<i>what Marvin Beckett was really like.</i>

19:18.957 --> 19:24.020
Miss Julian, did you bring this to me
because I knew Marvin Beckett personally?

19:24.096 --> 19:27.190
Did you? I wasn't aware
of that, Your Honor.

19:27.266 --> 19:29.962
Were you aware of that,
Agent Booth?

19:30.035 --> 19:33.869
<i>We'd like to do this slowly</i>
<i>and carefully, Judge. That's all.</i>

19:33.939 --> 19:36.908
And we want to exhume Gus Harper
so we can make sure...

19:36.975 --> 19:39.967
<i>he was murdered in exactly</i>
<i>the way the damn F.B. I...</i>

19:40.045 --> 19:42.809
said he was murdered, Your Honor.

19:42.881 --> 19:47.784
<i>[Saroyan] As mandated by the writ</i>
<i>of exhumation byJudge Theodore Kemper...</i>

19:47.853 --> 19:49.946
<i>of the D.C. Federal Judicial District...</i>

19:50.022 --> 19:53.651
<i>I, Dr. Camille Saroyan,</i>
<i>will be performing an autopsy...</i>

19:53.725 --> 19:56.125
<i>of Special Agent</i>
<i>Augustus Donald Harper...</i>

19:56.195 --> 19:59.392
<i>under the auspices</i>
<i>of theJeffersonian Institution.</i>

19:59.464 --> 20:02.956
<i>Date of death:</i>
<i>June 25, 1978.</i>

20:03.035 --> 20:06.903
<i>Date of internment:</i>
<i>July 2, 1978.</i>

20:06.972 --> 20:09.497
<i>Date of exhumation:</i>
<i>that would be today.</i>

20:09.575 --> 20:13.272
<i>Also present at the post-exhumation</i>
<i>autopsy is Dr. Temperance Brennan.</i>

20:13.345 --> 20:17.577
<i>The original autopsy in 1978</i>
<i>found that Agent Harper...</i>

20:17.649 --> 20:20.914
<i>was killed when he was shot</i>
<i>three times at close range...</i>

20:20.986 --> 20:23.978
<i>by a.38 Colt Detective</i>
<i>Special revolver.</i>

20:24.056 --> 20:27.116
<i>Two shots to the chest,</i>
<i>one piercing the heart.</i>

20:27.192 --> 20:29.251
The other, the left lung.

20:29.328 --> 20:33.662
The third,
a shot to the frontal bone.

20:35.767 --> 20:39.863
- What?
- That bullet hole in the head, that's from a.38.

20:39.938 --> 20:43.339
- Just like the coroner said.
- I can already tell these two holes...

20:43.408 --> 20:46.172
are from something a whole lot bigger
than a snub-nosed revolver.

20:46.245 --> 20:49.305
<i>Something more like a rifle</i>
<i>that a sniper would use.</i>

20:49.381 --> 20:53.681
Zack, you'd better get a full set of X-rays
before Dr. Saroyan reopens.

20:53.752 --> 20:57.620
We're gonna conduct this one
like the whole world is watching.

21:03.095 --> 21:06.861
- Hey, Russ.
- Okay, I'm here. What's up?

21:06.932 --> 21:09.059
<i>You know, you're an idiot, Russ.</i>

21:09.134 --> 21:12.069
I like you,
but you're a real idiot.

21:12.137 --> 21:14.799
- <i>What'd I do?</i>
- I got a call from your parole officer today.

21:14.873 --> 21:16.704
Why?

21:16.775 --> 21:19.869
Why? Because you crossed
state lines without informing him.

21:19.945 --> 21:23.005
I just told him you were aiding
in an F.B.I. investigation.

21:23.081 --> 21:25.072
Thanks.

21:26.918 --> 21:28.852
You're slipping, aren't ya?

21:28.920 --> 21:30.979
Look, I want to marry Amy
and raise her kids.

21:31.056 --> 21:33.320
One of them is sick.
That costs money.

21:33.392 --> 21:36.759
I'm a felon on parole.
I work part-time as a mechanic.

21:36.828 --> 21:41.026
You tell me what job am I gonna get that lets me
be the man I need to be to raise a family?

21:41.099 --> 21:45.502
You got this sick little girl
depending on you. I get that.

21:45.570 --> 21:49.529
But you go back inside and you cross
that line, you're not helping anyone out.

21:49.608 --> 21:52.270
- <i>[Gunshot]</i>
- <i>[Woman Screams]</i>

21:52.344 --> 21:54.369
Everybody down!

21:54.446 --> 21:56.710
<i>[People Shouting, Gasping]</i>

22:05.857 --> 22:09.088
[Woman On TV] Civil rights activist
and convicted murderer Marvin Beckett...

22:09.161 --> 22:11.220
was released today
when a second autopsy...

22:11.296 --> 22:14.288
on his alleged victim,
F.B.I. Agent Gus Harper...

22:14.366 --> 22:19.963
revealed inconsistencies with details
of Mr. Beckett's trial back in 1979.

22:20.038 --> 22:21.972
<i>[Coulter]</i>
<i>What kind of inconsistencies?</i>

22:22.040 --> 22:24.804
You have your confidences
to keep, Father. I have mine.

22:24.876 --> 22:26.810
<i>Well, it's over, right?</i>

22:26.878 --> 22:29.813
I mean, now that it's out,
there's no reason to kill Russ.

22:29.881 --> 22:32.543
You know, the men behind this,
they don't care about Marvin Beckett.

22:32.617 --> 22:35.916
- <i>They care about being exposed.</i>
- Lucky you were together.

22:35.987 --> 22:39.753
- <i>Why were you together?</i>
- Oh, you know, a man's gotta eat.

22:39.825 --> 22:44.990
<i>To think that some people still refuse</i>
<i>to believe in guardian angels.</i>

22:45.063 --> 22:46.826
Booth!

22:49.134 --> 22:51.728
- Who's that?
- <i>[Booth] Deputy Director Kirby.</i>

22:51.803 --> 22:54.567
My boss's boss's boss.

22:58.143 --> 23:02.273
- You're what's known as a real
pain in the ass, Agent Booth.
- Yes, sir.

23:02.347 --> 23:05.009
I just had my testicles
handed to me...

23:05.083 --> 23:09.520
by the attorney general of
the United States of America.

23:09.588 --> 23:12.421
He wanted to know why
this Marvin Beckett issue...

23:12.491 --> 23:15.619
wasn't done slowly and carefully
with greater forethought and tact.

23:15.694 --> 23:17.093
- <i>You know what I told him?</i>
- No, sir.

23:17.162 --> 23:19.528
I told him I did not know.

23:19.598 --> 23:22.089
Sir, I had to do it the way
I did it because the F.B. I...

23:22.167 --> 23:24.658
Not your decision, Booth.

23:26.605 --> 23:29.802
You're suspended without pay.

23:29.875 --> 23:31.843
Gun, I.D., security card, please.

23:31.910 --> 23:34.470
Sir, I'm entitled to the reading
of the charges against me.

23:34.546 --> 23:38.038
The charges against you...

23:38.116 --> 23:41.449
are that I was pissed upon
from a very great height!

23:41.520 --> 23:44.216
You're out of here in 10 minutes.

23:49.027 --> 23:51.655
<i>Can they do that? Just kick you out</i>
<i>without any warning?</i>

23:51.730 --> 23:54.790
The two guys standing behind me
with the guns seemed to think so.

23:54.866 --> 23:58.233
As you can see, Harper's ribs and sternum
were practically obliterated...

23:58.303 --> 24:00.294
<i>by the two shots</i>
<i>to his torso.</i>

24:00.372 --> 24:02.499
Zack, Booth got fired.

24:02.574 --> 24:06.533
- Suspended, not fired.
- Suspended's F.B.I. speak for fired.

24:06.611 --> 24:09.637
Do you know what hurts the most?
They took the car. I got no wheels.

24:09.714 --> 24:12.148
<i>The bullets themselves</i>
<i>were removed from the body.</i>

24:12.217 --> 24:15.846
- But Hodgins found some very small fragments.
- Copper, lead, polymer.

24:15.921 --> 24:17.855
I mean,
this is a conspiracy, baby.

24:17.923 --> 24:21.359
Guys, what we're dealing with here is that Booth
won't be working with us anymore.

24:21.426 --> 24:26.693
<i>Well, I got my own gun. It's just, God,</i>
<i>why did they have to take the company car?</i>

24:26.765 --> 24:28.756
I assume that the only way
Booth can get his car back...

24:28.834 --> 24:31.098
would be to solve the case
on his own and that we'd help.

24:31.169 --> 24:33.899
Oh, no. No, no.
I can't let you guys do that.

24:33.972 --> 24:37.373
Anyone who wants to help Booth,
raise their hands.

24:41.179 --> 24:47.118
<i>All right, I reverse engineered to find the</i>
<i>most likely design of the bullets.</i>

24:47.185 --> 24:51.053
After the bullet spread, lead pellets
were released like buckshot.

24:51.122 --> 24:54.182
Wait a second. That's a homemade round
invented back in the '70s.

24:54.259 --> 24:57.751
- We're talking a military-issue
M-40 A-1 sniper rifle.
- Nice.

24:57.829 --> 25:02.266
Dude, what you call being a conspiracy theorist,
I call being well-informed.

25:02.334 --> 25:05.633
Wait. Gus Harper was murdered
by a military sniper?

25:05.704 --> 25:09.606
- Who makes his own rounds.
- Maybe we could compare it
to the bullet that grazed Russ.

25:09.674 --> 25:11.801
I'm a civilian.
We don't have access to that round.

25:11.877 --> 25:14.937
<i>Maybe Caroline can help us.</i>

25:16.781 --> 25:18.476
<i>[Booth]</i>
<i>You still have a job?</i>

25:18.550 --> 25:21.280
Not for long.
I'm on performance review.

25:21.353 --> 25:25.289
None of the F.B.I. members of the Bank Robbery
Task Force had sniper training in the '70s.

25:25.357 --> 25:27.985
I need to know who else
was on that task force. Local...

25:28.059 --> 25:30.152
- Booth! Booth! I got it figured out.
- State cops, A.T.F.

25:30.228 --> 25:33.425
And if any of'em had sniper training.
Once you find out, you keep your head down.

25:33.498 --> 25:37.434
Task force, sniper training,
'70s, duck. Got it.

25:37.502 --> 25:41.165
- I figured out a way to solve
the case and get your job back.
- Wow. That'd be great.

25:41.239 --> 25:45.141
We need my father to give us the rest of the
evidence he stole from that safety-deposit box.

25:45.210 --> 25:46.677
- Great.
- I'll drive.

25:46.745 --> 25:52.115
Dr. Saroyan, when I get my doctorate,
I'd like to work here.

25:54.286 --> 25:56.811
Zack, you are
an excellent scientist.

25:56.888 --> 26:00.415
<i>But an important part of thejob</i>
<i>is appearing as an expert witness in court.</i>

26:00.492 --> 26:02.926
- Ooh.
- "Ooh," what?

26:02.994 --> 26:05.519
<i>Jurors have to take you seriously.</i>
<i>And frankly...</i>

26:05.597 --> 26:10.625
you look like a weekend fill-in
at a college radio station.

26:12.837 --> 26:16.273
Truth hurts, dude. Learn from it and grow.
[Chuckles]

26:19.878 --> 26:23.075
You weren't able to find Max by tracing him
through the cell phone call he made to me?

26:23.148 --> 26:25.207
Call came over the Internet.
It was untraceable.

26:25.283 --> 26:28.912
Well, Max always
did things his way.

26:28.987 --> 26:31.455
Guess your being a priest didn't
have much of an affect on him.

26:31.523 --> 26:35.983
Son, I spent my whole life
trying to turn Max's life toJesus.

26:36.061 --> 26:38.325
He knows exactly one Bible verse.

26:38.396 --> 26:41.297
<i>Numbers 35: 19.</i>

26:43.134 --> 26:46.069
"The revenger of blood himself
shall slay the murderer.

26:46.137 --> 26:48.662
When he meeteth him,
he shall slay him."

26:48.740 --> 26:51.834
- What's that mean?
- That's the law of the jungle.

26:51.910 --> 26:55.971
Father Coulter, if my father
makes contact with you again...

26:56.047 --> 26:58.311
please tell him
he needs to trust me.

26:58.383 --> 27:01.250
His way got my mother murdered
and almost got Russ killed.

27:01.319 --> 27:04.220
- It's time he tried my way.
- He won't contact me again.

27:04.289 --> 27:07.656
- Well, how do you know?
- Ask him.

27:07.726 --> 27:09.694
<i>He put me under surveillance.</i>

27:12.764 --> 27:15.232
If a parish priest can figure out
the F.B.I. is watching him...

27:15.300 --> 27:19.566
so can an experienced
fugitive like your father.

27:32.617 --> 27:34.847
I need a makeover.

27:34.919 --> 27:39.720
[Sighs] Zack, I am a big believer
in people being themselves.

27:39.791 --> 27:42.055
<i>You're actually</i>
<i>kind of cute.</i>

27:42.127 --> 27:44.220
Yes. I've been told that many times.

27:44.295 --> 27:46.627
Usually followed by the word "but."

27:46.698 --> 27:49.633
In this case,
"But no one takes you seriously."

27:51.269 --> 27:53.396
I need help, Angela.

27:56.708 --> 27:58.642
So, what do I do first?

28:11.122 --> 28:13.113
Lose the floppy hair.

28:13.191 --> 28:15.421
[Groans]

28:15.627 --> 28:17.925
- Why are you mad at me?
- [Sighs] I need a gun.

28:17.996 --> 28:20.624
No, you don't. You got me.
I'm your gun. You want equipment?

28:20.699 --> 28:25.068
Here. Have these. All right? New division of labor.
I shoot 'em, you cuff'em.

28:25.136 --> 28:27.434
Why didn't you tell me
you had Father Coulter under surveillance?

28:27.505 --> 28:30.167
It is my job to find your dad
and put him in prison.

28:30.241 --> 28:32.641
- And you don't think I'll help.
- <i>He's your father.</i>

28:32.711 --> 28:35.077
I really don't think I should
have to ask you to help.

28:35.146 --> 28:38.513
He abandoned me, Booth. And that's
the best thing you can say about him.

28:38.583 --> 28:40.517
Your father lives by a certain code.

28:40.585 --> 28:44.180
And part of that code is defending
his family by whatever means necessary.

28:44.255 --> 28:46.621
You mean killing people
and setting their corpses on fire?

28:46.691 --> 28:49.455
- "Any means necessary" sort of covers that.
- You respect him?

28:49.527 --> 28:51.586
I'm just saying in his world,
he's a very honorable man.

28:51.663 --> 28:54.632
That's ridiculous.
There's only one world. It's this one.

28:54.699 --> 28:56.860
Would that be the one world where you're mad
at me for trying to catch your father?

28:56.935 --> 28:59.130
- Or the other world where you
actually want him caught?
- Neither.

28:59.204 --> 29:01.764
- You have to pick one.
- Either. Both.

29:01.840 --> 29:04.331
<i>Dr. Brennan, Agent Booth...</i>

29:04.409 --> 29:09.108
I thought you'd like to meet the reason
we're all losing our jobs and getting shot at.

29:09.180 --> 29:11.978
This is Mr. Marvin Beckett.

29:12.050 --> 29:14.814
- I wanted to thank you personally.
- You're welcome, Mr. Beckett.

29:14.886 --> 29:19.721
<i>Thirty years ago, crooked agents put me</i>
<i>in jail for something I did not do.</i>

29:19.791 --> 29:24.125
I did not kill the young F.B.I. agent.
I did not steal the money.

29:24.195 --> 29:26.026
<i>And I thank you for proving it</i>
<i>to the world.</i>

29:26.097 --> 29:30.693
That's why I'm here to tell you
to your face, to assure you...

29:30.769 --> 29:32.737
I did not do those things.

29:32.804 --> 29:34.738
<i>You freed an innocent man.</i>

29:34.806 --> 29:39.004
And in return,
I must warn you...

29:39.077 --> 29:42.376
the people that did this to me
aren't just a bunch of corrupt cops.

29:42.447 --> 29:46.383
<i>They serve masters</i>
<i>of much greater influence.</i>

29:46.451 --> 29:49.477
You're looking to bring
their world down around their ears.

29:49.554 --> 29:51.488
They will strike at you.

29:51.556 --> 29:54.286
Watch yourselves.

29:56.094 --> 29:59.188
Here's your list of snipers
from the decade of disco.

29:59.264 --> 30:03.030
This time I'm advising you.
Duck.

30:04.302 --> 30:07.999
- Anyone you know?
- Yeah.

30:08.072 --> 30:12.236
The A.T.F. rep on the task force
was a marine sniper, Robert Kirby.

30:12.310 --> 30:14.608
F.B.I. Deputy Director
Robert Kirby?

30:14.679 --> 30:17.705
That just suspended you?

30:17.782 --> 30:20.114
Call your brother,
tell him to get out of the house.

30:20.185 --> 30:23.086
- <i>Tell him to get out now.</i>
- Why? What's going on?

30:23.154 --> 30:25.622
Seconds after Caroline got this list,
Kirby knew about it.

30:25.690 --> 30:28.853
He's not answering.
I don't understand, Booth.

30:28.927 --> 30:31.896
It's not us that Kirby is afraid of.
It's your father.

30:31.963 --> 30:34.932
The only way to strike at him
is to go through you or Russ.

30:34.999 --> 30:38.799
- <i>Kirby was the one that took a shot at Russ.</i>
- No answer.

30:39.871 --> 30:41.736
- Russ?
- Hello?

30:41.806 --> 30:44.297
- All right, just stay back.
- Russ?

30:44.375 --> 30:48.334
- There's no sign of a break-in.
I'll check the back. Russ?
- <i>Russ?</i>

30:50.148 --> 30:52.309
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

30:52.383 --> 30:55.648
- Booth?
- <i>What?</i>

30:55.720 --> 30:59.918
- <i>Russ.</i>
- Just take it easy, all right?
We don't know that for sure.

30:59.991 --> 31:04.951
That's too much blood. Nobody could
survive that... that much blood loss.

31:05.029 --> 31:07.020
Nobody.

31:08.766 --> 31:11.826
All right. Okay.
It's all right.

31:11.903 --> 31:13.894
Oh, my God.

31:22.146 --> 31:24.944
It's against the law
us not calling in a murder.

31:25.016 --> 31:26.984
It wasn't a murder.
It was a bloodstain.

31:27.051 --> 31:31.147
That much blood,
it's mur... it's murder.

31:31.222 --> 31:36.455
We call it in, the next thing
is we find ourselves under arrest.

31:36.527 --> 31:38.461
That had to be Russ's blood.

31:38.529 --> 31:42.795
You got a sample, right?
We'll check the D.N.A. at the lab.

31:42.867 --> 31:46.701
Until then, who's the one who always says,
"Don't jump to conclusions"? Right?

31:46.771 --> 31:50.138
Yeah, you're right.

31:50.208 --> 31:52.699
Thanks.

31:52.777 --> 31:55.940
I wish you wouldn't keep letting
me hug you when I get scared.

31:56.014 --> 31:59.381
Hey, when I get scared,
I'll hug you.

31:59.450 --> 32:02.112
<i>We'll call it even.</i>

32:05.690 --> 32:07.885
- <i>Results?</i>
- The blood's not Russ's.

32:07.959 --> 32:10.689
- Even you can't do a D.N.A. test that fast.
- Didn't have to.

32:10.762 --> 32:14.027
Both Brennan and her brother
are "O" type blood, as was the mother.

32:14.098 --> 32:16.692
The blood sample
you brought me was "AB."

32:16.768 --> 32:18.861
- Therefore...
- Okay, let's go tell Bones.

32:18.937 --> 32:21.337
I just saw her.
She's on her way to see the priest.

32:21.406 --> 32:23.374
- Why?
- He said he had something for her.

32:23.441 --> 32:26.501
She can't be going places without me.
Not when it's open season on Brennans.

32:26.577 --> 32:28.977
- [Cell Phone Rings]
- Bones?

32:29.047 --> 32:31.311
[Caroline]
Not even close, <i>chéri.</i> We need to talk.

32:31.382 --> 32:34.146
Well, first, I want to tell you
that your brother...

32:34.218 --> 32:38.245
is, uh, with his father.

32:38.323 --> 32:41.315
You mean... with God?

32:41.392 --> 32:45.453
No, his earthly father...
your father.

32:45.530 --> 32:49.159
- Are you certain?
- Saw it with my own eyes.

32:49.233 --> 32:51.167
Oh, thank God.

32:51.235 --> 32:54.671
Which I use only
as a figure of speech.

32:54.739 --> 32:57.867
Well, you have
to start somewhere.

32:59.978 --> 33:02.640
You know, you're...
you're very much like him.

33:02.714 --> 33:05.444
I'm... I'm nothing
like my father.

33:05.516 --> 33:08.314
Black and white. The two of you,
you always saw the world in black and white.

33:08.386 --> 33:11.844
Your mother wasn't like that.
Either is Russell.

33:18.930 --> 33:20.864
All right, go.

33:20.932 --> 33:23.765
I was clearing out my desk
when my phone rings.

33:23.835 --> 33:25.769
And it's this F.B.I.
agent named Carlson.

33:25.837 --> 33:27.532
Yeah. He heads up
a surveillance unit.

33:27.605 --> 33:29.971
He tells me you and Booth are wasting
my time with this damn priest.

33:30.041 --> 33:31.975
I tell him, " You better mind
your mushy mouth."

33:32.043 --> 33:34.705
I gotta find Bones,
keep her from getting killed.

33:34.779 --> 33:37.111
Father Coulter
is 90 years old...

33:37.181 --> 33:41.311
confined to bed with Alzheimer's in a
convalescent home out there at the seminary.

33:41.386 --> 33:43.650
Which does not much sound like
the priest you told me about.

33:43.721 --> 33:47.350
Your father,
he talked about, uh...

33:47.425 --> 33:51.327
when you were four
and your brother was nine.

33:51.396 --> 33:54.126
And... And he hid behind this door
and he jumped out at you.

33:54.198 --> 33:57.929
- You know what? Just give me the keys to your car.
- My car?

33:58.002 --> 34:01.961
Boo! He hollers, "Boo!"
And you... you had this doll.

34:02.040 --> 34:04.770
- Had this string in the back for talking.
- Chatty Cathy.

34:06.377 --> 34:08.344
Wham! You took that doll.

34:08.413 --> 34:12.179
And you wound up. And you hit your brother
so hard you knocked him flat as a pancake.

34:12.250 --> 34:16.846
I said to your mother, " No one will ever
jump out at that girl again."

34:16.920 --> 34:20.880
And your mother said,
"Just like you, Max.

34:20.958 --> 34:23.152
She's just like you."

34:26.230 --> 34:29.630
Hair color, plastic surgery...

34:31.969 --> 34:34.494
colored contact lenses,
chin and cheek implants...

34:34.572 --> 34:37.768
<i>15 years older.</i>

34:40.178 --> 34:44.672
Still, I should have seen it.

34:47.051 --> 34:50.179
- [Tires Screech]
- [Horn Honks]

34:51.722 --> 34:54.953
- [Line Ringing]
- Come on, Bones. Pick up. Pick up!

34:55.025 --> 34:58.325
- This is Dr. Temperance Brennan. Leave a message.
- Damn it.

34:58.396 --> 35:01.126
Russ knew it was you all along?

35:01.199 --> 35:03.190
Yeah.

35:10.141 --> 35:13.133
You talk to Russ,
but not to me?

35:13.211 --> 35:15.145
You know, to tell you the truth...

35:15.213 --> 35:18.705
you do better without me
and Russ does worse.

35:18.783 --> 35:21.513
- Take this.
- I'm not religious.

35:21.586 --> 35:25.716
No. We're gonna play
this your way. Please.

35:30.228 --> 35:32.162
This is Gus Harper's journal.

35:32.230 --> 35:34.425
<i>There's a key there</i>
<i>that's to a safety-deposit box.</i>

35:34.499 --> 35:37.764
In that safety-deposit box
is all the evidence.

35:37.835 --> 35:41.999
Why didn't you give it
to them back in 1978?

35:42.073 --> 35:44.405
Because your mother took
one look at it and said...

35:44.475 --> 35:48.741
"If you turn this over to them,
they will kill us and our kids."

35:48.813 --> 35:50.747
They got Mom anyway.

35:50.815 --> 35:54.342
- There's not a day that goes by
that my heart is not broken.
- <i>[Vehicle Approaching]</i>

36:01.092 --> 36:03.287
Dad, come on!

36:03.361 --> 36:05.295
I gotta go.

36:09.667 --> 36:12.898
Wait. I can't let you go.

36:12.970 --> 36:15.097
Oh, I love you too.

36:15.173 --> 36:19.371
No. I mean, I can't let you go.

36:20.845 --> 36:23.040
- I'm sorry.
- [Moans]

36:23.114 --> 36:26.277
<i>I must be getting old.</i>
<i>I let you get the drop on me.</i>

36:26.350 --> 36:29.717
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I just can't let you get away.

36:32.957 --> 36:35.653
I'm sorry. Listen to me.

36:35.726 --> 36:41.426
If you find somebody that you can trust,
you hang on to him. Remember that.

36:41.499 --> 36:45.663
- <i>Dad, let's go!</i>
- I'm proud of you. I love you.

36:48.706 --> 36:50.230
Dad, get in.

36:56.681 --> 36:59.013
You take care of her.

37:00.651 --> 37:03.484
- F.B.I. Stop or I'll shoot.
- Booth.

37:04.755 --> 37:08.282
<i>Booth. Booth.</i>

37:30.081 --> 37:32.515
Oh.

37:40.024 --> 37:43.858
Right. Did he really have to hit the car?
I wasn't gonna chase him.

37:56.140 --> 37:58.540
You okay?

38:06.951 --> 38:09.715
<i># [Indie Rock]</i>

39:23.027 --> 39:25.552
- What's this?
- Zack's doctorate.

39:25.629 --> 39:27.563
I'd like to recommend him
for a job.

39:27.631 --> 39:29.462
I can't put him in front of a jury.
I'm sorry.

39:29.533 --> 39:33.299
<i>I'll put in a good word in Pure Research.</i>
<i>That way, he can come visit once in a while.</i>

39:33.371 --> 39:37.967
- Visit?
- <i>Dr. Saroyan, Dr. Brennan, Dr. Hodgins...</i>

39:38.042 --> 39:41.307
I'd like to present your colleague.

39:41.379 --> 39:44.906
Dr. Zachary Uriah Addy.

39:47.251 --> 39:49.913
<i>[Chuckles]</i>
<i>Look at you.</i>

39:49.987 --> 39:52.979
- All grown up.
- <i>[Saroyan] Wow.</i>

39:53.057 --> 39:55.491
Very impressive.

39:55.559 --> 39:57.925
I can learn how to be effective
in front of juries.

39:57.995 --> 40:00.463
Zack can learn anything.

40:08.706 --> 40:10.799
All right, he's hired.

40:10.875 --> 40:13.867
<i>Who am I to break up this team?</i>

40:13.944 --> 40:16.538
- Lunch is on me, Dr. Addy.
Anywhere you want to go.
- The diner.

40:16.614 --> 40:19.310
- Anywhere, I said.
- I like the diner.

40:19.383 --> 40:22.511
Hey, do me a favor, Uriah.

40:22.586 --> 40:25.555
Need a little time to adjust
to your fascist haircut.

40:27.758 --> 40:29.749
Let's go.

40:35.232 --> 40:37.598
Congratulations, Dr. Addy.

40:40.571 --> 40:43.131
Thank you, Dr. Brennan.

40:43.207 --> 40:45.675
<i>[Angela]</i>
<i>Zack, congratulations.</i>

40:45.743 --> 40:47.540
- <i>[Hodgins] Congratulations.</i>
- <i>Hear, hear!</i>

40:47.611 --> 40:51.012
<i>[Hodgins]</i>
<i>It's about time, man. Congratulations.</i>

40:52.416 --> 40:54.907
<i>[Saroyan]</i>
<i>You should be proud of yourself.</i>

40:57.755 --> 40:59.689
What happened?

40:59.757 --> 41:03.591
<i>Well, the attorney general took one look at</i>
<i>the, uh, evidence your father provided.</i>

41:03.661 --> 41:06.630
And, you know,
he reinstated me.

41:08.098 --> 41:10.999
I'm glad.

41:11.068 --> 41:13.730
Listen. We, uh, found
another burned body.

41:13.804 --> 41:16.967
Same place, same setup.

41:17.041 --> 41:19.373
- Kirby?
- I'm pretty sure.

41:19.443 --> 41:21.741
It was Kirby's blood in your apartment.

41:21.812 --> 41:25.179
Dad's still trying to warn people.
Leave me and Russ alone.

41:25.249 --> 41:27.717
Uh, Russ, he's safe with your father.

41:27.785 --> 41:31.448
They're warning people
to stay away from you.

41:31.522 --> 41:34.787
You know what? I'm sorry that
you had to go through it again.

41:34.859 --> 41:38.260
Watching your family drive off,
you know, leaving you behind.

41:39.830 --> 41:41.855
- I'm sorry.
- My father is... is...

41:41.932 --> 41:45.595
He's your dad.
And he loves you.

41:52.710 --> 41:56.669
You know, I'm just...

41:56.747 --> 41:59.147
I'm just one of those people
who doesn't get to be in a family.

41:59.216 --> 42:01.241
That's...

42:01.318 --> 42:05.277
Listen, Bones. Hey, there's more
than one kind of family.

42:15.132 --> 42:18.260
- Well, Zack got the job, right?
- Come in and congratulate him.

42:18.335 --> 42:20.667
Nah. He's your squints.
Not my squints.

42:20.738 --> 42:24.469
No. Booth, we are all
of us your squints.

42:24.542 --> 42:29.070
Do me a favor and pat Zack
on the shoulder with an open hand.

42:29.146 --> 42:31.637
What? Why?
Does that mean something?

42:31.715 --> 42:34.047
[Chuckles]

43:09.019 --> 43:10.384
What's that mean?
