WEBVTT

01:04.814 --> 01:06.941
- Hm.

01:10.820 --> 01:13.531
- At long last, Angelyne.

01:13.573 --> 01:15.116
- Jeff.

01:16.951 --> 01:20.330
I'll have a plate of tomatoes
and a coffee, please, Ronnie.

01:20.372 --> 01:22.665
- Of course.

01:22.707 --> 01:23.667
- Is that for me?

01:23.708 --> 01:24.834
- It is, yeah.

01:24.876 --> 01:25.919
It's your perfume.

01:25.960 --> 01:28.963
- Mm.
What a gentleman.

01:29.005 --> 01:32.967
This smell--
this is the way to world peace.

01:33.009 --> 01:34.177
- Hope you enjoy.

01:34.219 --> 01:37.222
I did not bring her perfume.

01:37.263 --> 01:39.182
I didn't.

01:42.102 --> 01:43.603
- You can give the check
to him.

01:48.316 --> 01:50.652
- May I?
- Mm-hmm.

01:50.694 --> 01:52.696
So when are you going
to publish this?

01:52.737 --> 01:54.614
I don't know.

01:54.656 --> 01:56.241
We literally just started
the conversation.

01:56.282 --> 01:57.951
- Because Indiegogo has
a time limit,

01:57.992 --> 02:01.454
and I want the filet mignon
of billboard space.

02:01.496 --> 02:03.498
- Right.
Well, the more we talk,

02:03.540 --> 02:05.667
the better I get to know you,
the sooner I can publish.

02:05.709 --> 02:08.878
How's that?

02:08.920 --> 02:12.757
You are such a Taurus.

02:12.799 --> 02:13.967
It's cute.

02:14.009 --> 02:15.010
- I am a Taurus.

02:15.051 --> 02:16.803
How'd you figure that out?

02:16.845 --> 02:20.015
- Passionate, persistent,
persuasive.

02:20.056 --> 02:21.057
You courted me.

02:21.099 --> 02:22.183
- You made me court you.

02:22.225 --> 02:23.893
- Did I?

02:25.395 --> 02:26.688
- You know,

02:26.730 --> 02:28.815
I grew up seeing
your billboards all over town.

02:33.403 --> 02:34.863
There were hundreds of them.

02:34.904 --> 02:38.241
How were you financing
the billboards back in the day?

02:38.283 --> 02:39.367
Is it true there was
a rich husband

02:39.409 --> 02:40.368
who paid for everything?

02:40.410 --> 02:42.037
- Silly boy.

02:42.078 --> 02:44.372
All rumors.

02:44.414 --> 02:47.167
None of it is true.

02:47.208 --> 02:50.128
- Angelyne's billboards?

02:50.170 --> 02:52.589
My dad paid for those.

03:10.982 --> 03:13.943
- "I-I could beat you
in a court."

03:32.003 --> 03:33.004
Oh.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.548
Well, would you look at that?

03:35.590 --> 03:39.260
The avocados
are finally coming in.

03:39.302 --> 03:40.804
Hm.

03:41.805 --> 03:43.807
Hey, darling.
- Morning, Dad.

03:45.266 --> 03:46.434
- Ah.

03:57.362 --> 03:58.822
For Chrissake, Harold.

03:58.863 --> 03:59.823
This is my home!

03:59.864 --> 04:01.324
Tell her
to call you at the office.

04:01.366 --> 04:04.119
- I don't even know
how she got this number.

04:04.160 --> 04:06.287
She is really something else.

04:06.329 --> 04:07.622
- Of course you know how
she got it.

04:07.664 --> 04:08.748
You gave it to her.

04:08.790 --> 04:10.458
Just admit it.
- Dad.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.293
Please don't answer.

04:12.335 --> 04:13.420
- You won't admit it, though,
will you?

04:13.461 --> 04:15.171
Because you're a coward.
- Oh, Eve, honey,

04:15.213 --> 04:16.423
that is not nice.

04:16.464 --> 04:17.882
I never call you names.
- I just can't--

04:17.924 --> 04:19.801
I can't take it anymore.
Not in my house.

04:19.843 --> 04:21.553
I swear, I will leave
and move back to London

04:21.594 --> 04:27.058
if you answer this phone.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.101
- Excuse me.

04:28.143 --> 04:31.146
- Dad,
please don't do this to Mom!

04:31.187 --> 04:34.274
- Your mother likes
to be upset about things.

04:36.651 --> 04:39.279
Good morning, Angelyne.

04:39.320 --> 04:40.530
- No!

04:40.572 --> 04:42.240
- Oh, really?

04:42.282 --> 04:44.367
- Okay,
maybe it wasn't that bad,

04:44.409 --> 04:47.996
but I remember it feeling
that bad.

04:48.038 --> 04:53.335
I mean, we used to be a fun,
loving, peaceful, Jewish family

04:53.376 --> 04:55.295
before she came along.

04:55.337 --> 04:57.088
Right?

04:57.130 --> 05:00.175
every day for years,

05:00.216 --> 05:03.219
7:00 a.m., 11:00 p.m.

05:03.261 --> 05:05.430
Can I speak to your daddykins?

05:07.474 --> 05:09.017
Uh, who was this woman,

05:09.059 --> 05:11.936
and what was she doing
in my life?

05:11.978 --> 05:13.855
- Wendy...

05:13.897 --> 05:15.190
Oh, his daughter?

05:18.568 --> 05:21.029
She's hardly even a part
of the story.

05:21.071 --> 05:24.157
- So my father's name was
Harold Wallach.

05:24.199 --> 05:25.533
<i>He ran a printing company</i>

05:25.575 --> 05:27.035
<i>that he had inherited</i>
<i>from his father.</i>

05:27.077 --> 05:30.038
<i>Uh, they did posters,</i>
<i>billboards, you know,</i>

05:30.080 --> 05:30.955
<i>paid ads.</i>

05:30.997 --> 05:33.124
<i>His employees just loved him--</i>

05:33.166 --> 05:34.584
<i>just loyal as they come--</i>

05:34.626 --> 05:36.670
<i>because my dad took care</i>
<i>of them.</i>

06:07.992 --> 06:09.994
- Harold Wallach,

06:10.036 --> 06:11.162
please.

06:12.455 --> 06:15.125
- Um, is he expecting you?

06:15.166 --> 06:17.085
- That depends.

06:17.127 --> 06:21.631
Tell him I'm a busty blonde
with a business proposition,

06:21.673 --> 06:23.425
and I guess we'll see.

06:26.803 --> 06:29.514
If you'd like,
I can go back there myself.

07:00.545 --> 07:01.796
- Are you an actress?
- Mm-hmm.

07:01.838 --> 07:02.964
- You reading a screenplay?

07:03.006 --> 07:05.008
- Yeah, it's for a show
I'm in...

07:05.050 --> 07:06.176
or going to be in.

07:06.217 --> 07:08.261
We're waiting
for the network to decide.

07:08.303 --> 07:11.139
- That's fun.
- Mm-hmm.

07:11.181 --> 07:14.142
- I thought about writing
a screenplay once...

07:14.184 --> 07:17.145
about a scientist who creates
a giant bra

07:17.187 --> 07:20.357
that turns me into a genius
who can fight evil.

07:22.609 --> 07:24.861
- Cool.

07:24.903 --> 07:28.656
- Hi,
Mr. Wallach will see you now.

07:28.698 --> 07:30.909
- Good luck with your show.
- Thanks.

07:30.950 --> 07:32.577
- If you believe
that it can happen,

07:32.619 --> 07:34.537
it will.

07:38.375 --> 07:40.669
And my old boyfriend used
to handle all the pictures,

07:40.710 --> 07:42.837
but he is out of the picture.
- Mm-hmm.

07:42.879 --> 07:44.923
- And I don't even know
where he got them printed,

07:44.964 --> 07:48.009
but he was super cheap,
and I only want the best.

07:48.051 --> 07:51.054
So I grabbed the yellow pages,

07:51.096 --> 07:54.808
I closed my eyes,
and I said,

07:54.849 --> 07:56.726
"Find me the best printer

07:56.768 --> 08:00.355
<i>in all the land,</i>
<i>gods and fairies."</i>

08:11.574 --> 08:13.201
You are the best, right?

08:13.243 --> 08:14.202
- Oh, yeah--yes.

08:14.244 --> 08:15.662
Of course.

08:15.704 --> 08:17.247
Gods and fairies, right.

08:17.288 --> 08:19.791
We can do your posters,
of course.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.210
Whoever did these used
the four-color process,

08:22.252 --> 08:24.713
so the pink doesn't really, uh,
pop out like it should.

08:24.754 --> 08:27.924
- You are so smart, Harold.

08:27.966 --> 08:29.718
- Wow.

08:29.759 --> 08:31.720
Thank you.

08:31.761 --> 08:35.223
Uh, but uh, look,
I--I--I have to ask,

08:35.265 --> 08:36.975
what are you advertising?

08:37.017 --> 08:39.019
- Oh, these old ones were
for my band.

08:39.060 --> 08:41.229
We're currently looking
for a new guitarist.

08:41.271 --> 08:43.523
It's a long story.

08:43.565 --> 08:45.400
The new ones will be just
for me.

08:45.442 --> 08:46.359
- So you're a singer?

08:46.401 --> 08:47.402
- I'm...

08:49.404 --> 08:51.698
Whatever you want me to be.

08:51.740 --> 08:54.117
- Oh.

08:54.159 --> 08:55.577
Okay.

08:55.618 --> 08:57.454
Well, right.

08:57.495 --> 09:03.126
We do posters for cigarettes
and soda and movies and...

09:03.168 --> 09:05.628
so--so
what are you advertising?

09:05.670 --> 09:08.048
- Myself, of course.

09:08.089 --> 09:09.758
- Yourself?

09:11.593 --> 09:12.844
- Myself.

09:12.886 --> 09:15.347
- You wanna put up posters
of yourself,

09:15.388 --> 09:16.848
just you,
around the city?

09:16.890 --> 09:18.058
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

09:18.099 --> 09:19.225
Why not?

09:19.267 --> 09:21.394
Nobody's ever done it.
Why not start now?

09:21.436 --> 09:23.897
- Well, I--I'm not one
to turn down business,

09:23.938 --> 09:25.857
but it's
a very unorthodox idea.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.942
- Well, we didn't need
to send a man to the Moon.

09:27.984 --> 09:30.278
That could also be thought of
as an unorthodox idea.

09:30.320 --> 09:33.323
But we did it, and it inspired
millions of people

09:33.365 --> 09:35.742
around the globe,
maybe even the galaxy.

09:35.784 --> 09:37.118
We don't know yet.
- Hmm.

09:37.160 --> 09:40.413
- I'm only interested
in paving new roads, Harold,

09:40.455 --> 09:41.998
not following old ones.

09:42.040 --> 09:43.750
But if you'd rather follow
an old one,

09:43.792 --> 09:46.503
that's okay,
and I'll find someone else.

09:47.837 --> 09:49.881
- I never thought of it
like that before.

09:55.011 --> 09:58.640
Now this could be brilliant.
Brilliant.

09:58.682 --> 09:59.849
It--it's a kind

09:59.891 --> 10:02.435
of avant-garde advertising.
- Dad?

10:02.477 --> 10:04.145
- Like you're--one second,
honey--like you're making

10:04.187 --> 10:06.981
some radical social statement.

10:07.023 --> 10:09.317
Now, I'm not sure
what that statement is exactly,

10:09.359 --> 10:12.237
but maybe that's why
it's so inspiring.

10:12.278 --> 10:15.198
And with your looks
and charisma,

10:15.240 --> 10:17.826
perhaps we should think bigger.
- I like that.

10:17.867 --> 10:19.577
- Mm-hmm.
Perhaps--

10:19.619 --> 10:21.955
- Much bigger?
- Yep.

10:21.996 --> 10:25.083
- Imagine my face...

10:25.125 --> 10:29.421
here on a billboard looking
over all of Hollywood.

10:29.462 --> 10:33.842
Imagine all this
for the entire world to see.

10:33.883 --> 10:35.176
- God, yes!

10:35.218 --> 10:37.387
And people will look up
and wonder--

10:37.429 --> 10:40.015
oh, it will drive them mad
with curiosity.

10:40.056 --> 10:41.599
They'll think,
"Who is this woman?"

10:41.641 --> 10:43.518
'Cause you're not a movie star.
You're not a model.

10:43.560 --> 10:44.728
You're just--
- Angelyne.

10:44.769 --> 10:46.187
- The billboard queen.

10:48.189 --> 10:50.275
- Yes.

10:50.316 --> 10:51.484
Yes.

10:51.526 --> 10:52.569
- Ah.

10:52.610 --> 10:53.695
What's your budget?

10:56.072 --> 10:57.699
- Well,
I--I don't have a budget.

11:00.076 --> 11:03.038
But if everything goes
according to my master plan,

11:03.079 --> 11:04.831
I'll be
the most adored celebrity

11:04.873 --> 11:06.875
in the universe by 1989.

11:08.501 --> 11:11.546
I'll be the best investment
you ever made, Harold.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.347
- This is the one, I think,

11:20.388 --> 11:21.765
for the billboard.

11:21.806 --> 11:23.767
I'll need the negative.
Maybe we can crop it to fit.

11:23.808 --> 11:26.186
- No, mm-mm.

11:26.227 --> 11:27.604
- Hmm?
- It's this one.

11:29.189 --> 11:32.650
It's all in my eyes, Harold.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.069
Look in my eyes.

11:36.321 --> 11:37.614
No, no.
These eyes.

11:37.655 --> 11:38.823
- Oh, I can't see your eyes.

11:38.865 --> 11:40.492
- Exactly.

11:40.533 --> 11:46.790
I want, uh,
a mysterious, ethereal quality.

11:48.458 --> 11:49.501
Do you feel it?

11:51.503 --> 11:56.216
I'm hypnotizing you
without saying a word.

11:56.257 --> 11:57.926
- Well, sure,
but it's my money,

11:57.967 --> 11:59.177
and I think that this picture--

11:59.219 --> 12:01.596
- It's my face up there,
Harold, not yours.

12:01.638 --> 12:02.806
It's this one.

12:08.478 --> 12:10.522
- You're right.
That's the one.

12:12.065 --> 12:13.274
- And...
- Hm?

12:13.316 --> 12:15.318
- I don't want a lot of words.

12:15.360 --> 12:16.903
Just my name.
- Mm-hmm.

12:16.945 --> 12:18.530
And my number.
- Mm-hmm.

12:18.571 --> 12:19.572
- Now...

12:20.824 --> 12:24.160
I've gotta be honest.
This is all quite...

12:24.202 --> 12:27.455
quite intoxicating.

12:27.497 --> 12:30.792
You know, I had dreams of being
a big-time film director.

12:30.834 --> 12:32.335
- What happened
to those dreams?

12:32.377 --> 12:33.878
What happens to all dreams.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.046
Life gets in the way.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.548
My father needed me
at the plant.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.550
That's what you do.

12:38.591 --> 12:44.472
- Well, if you had become
a big, famous director...

12:46.141 --> 12:48.768
Then we wouldn't be sitting
here together, would we?

12:48.810 --> 12:50.186
- That's true.

12:50.228 --> 12:52.689
- You have to take all
of those negative thoughts

12:52.731 --> 12:54.107
and...

12:55.775 --> 12:57.485
Put 'em in a ball.
- Mm-hmm.

12:57.527 --> 12:59.320
And you throw them away.

12:59.362 --> 13:02.449
- Only focus on the positive.

13:02.490 --> 13:03.742
- On the positive?

13:05.285 --> 13:07.078
My daughter, Wendy,
is about to star

13:07.120 --> 13:09.748
on her own television show.

13:09.789 --> 13:12.292
How 'bout that?
I always knew with her.

13:12.334 --> 13:14.169
I couldn't be more proud.

13:15.587 --> 13:19.299
- Well,
that Wendy is one lucky girl.

13:19.341 --> 13:21.092
- You're from the Valley.
I can tell by the accent.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.805
Born and raised.

13:25.847 --> 13:27.766
You are so smart, Harold.

13:29.351 --> 13:30.852
Is your family still there?

13:30.894 --> 13:32.270
- No, well, oof.

13:32.312 --> 13:36.274
My sister is here, and there,
and everywhere,

13:36.316 --> 13:39.361
and our mother died
when we were very young.

13:39.402 --> 13:41.071
And...

13:41.112 --> 13:43.198
my father abandoned us.

13:43.239 --> 13:47.452
Men have always had
such great power over women.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.204
Throughout the history
of the universe,

13:49.245 --> 13:53.166
men have been able to do
whatever they want to women.

13:53.208 --> 13:55.126
Sometimes they get a slap
on the wrist.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.629
Other times,
no one says a word.

13:57.671 --> 14:03.176
But men are also so easy
to control.

14:03.218 --> 14:06.846
Seducing a man
is the most effective way

14:06.888 --> 14:08.390
a woman can control a man,

14:08.431 --> 14:10.684
and once you control them,

14:10.725 --> 14:12.477
you take the power back.

14:12.519 --> 14:15.897
And that is all I did
with that first billboard.

14:15.939 --> 14:19.693
I seduced an entire city,

14:19.734 --> 14:22.028
and I took the power back.

14:22.070 --> 14:24.572
<i>I had my dream team.</i>

14:24.614 --> 14:27.492
<i>Harold was</i>
<i>the business genius,</i>

14:27.534 --> 14:29.828
<i>Freddy was the photo genius,</i>

14:29.869 --> 14:32.414
<i>and I was the art.</i>

14:32.455 --> 14:35.250
<i>The mastery was</i>
<i>at a whole new level.</i>

14:35.291 --> 14:37.460
<i>If it wasn't</i>
<i>absolutely perfect</i>

14:37.502 --> 14:39.754
<i>and pristine,</i>
<i>we'd start over.</i>

14:41.172 --> 14:44.217
<i>We hunted</i>
<i>for the perfect location.</i>

14:44.259 --> 14:46.761
<i>It had to be impossible</i>
<i>to miss.</i>

14:46.803 --> 14:48.013
Right there.

14:48.054 --> 14:49.264
- Well, that's the money.

14:49.305 --> 14:51.099
- What do you think?
You like that spot?

14:51.141 --> 14:53.768
- It seems kind
of perfect.

14:56.813 --> 14:58.606
- Harold?
- Hmm?

15:00.233 --> 15:01.651
Here we go.

15:01.693 --> 15:04.904
<i>- People paint me</i>
<i>as a vapid, talentless,</i>

15:04.946 --> 15:08.199
<i>over-the-top cartoon</i>
<i>who's only obsessed</i>

15:08.241 --> 15:10.201
<i>with fame and success.</i>

15:11.453 --> 15:14.164
Paint me however you'd like.

15:14.205 --> 15:16.291
But more than anything,

15:16.332 --> 15:18.460
this is about survival.

15:35.560 --> 15:36.603
- Hey!

15:49.115 --> 15:51.284
- Is that you up there?

15:52.660 --> 15:54.746
- Uh-huh.

16:01.753 --> 16:02.754
<i>- Oh!</i>

16:04.297 --> 16:06.591
- Can I get your autograph?

16:07.842 --> 16:09.386
- As many as you want.

16:09.427 --> 16:10.595
- Oh, hey. Can I get one?

16:10.637 --> 16:13.098
- Uh, you know,
for my girlfriend.

16:15.141 --> 16:17.060
- Sure.

16:19.646 --> 16:20.939
- Thank you.

16:36.413 --> 16:38.456
- Harold and I were
on a rocket ship

16:38.498 --> 16:42.335
destined to pop the bubble
of the universe.

16:42.377 --> 16:45.130
Should I start?

16:45.171 --> 16:46.214
Ooh.

16:46.256 --> 16:48.341
<i>- So why billboards?</i>

16:48.383 --> 16:49.509
<i>- Why not?</i>

16:49.551 --> 16:52.220
<i>It was the next logical step.</i>

16:52.262 --> 16:53.638
<i>First it was the posters.</i>

16:53.680 --> 16:55.515
<i>Now it's billboards.</i>

16:55.557 --> 16:58.101
If you wanna grab
people's attention,

16:58.143 --> 17:00.061
you have to tease.

17:00.103 --> 17:03.314
- So who paid
for the billboards, though?

17:03.356 --> 17:04.858
Uh, your father?

17:04.899 --> 17:05.984
Rich husband?

17:07.569 --> 17:10.155
- I'm a bright pink light,

17:10.196 --> 17:11.448
a beacon.

17:13.116 --> 17:17.412
I'm here to inspire joy
and bring the consciousness

17:17.454 --> 17:21.541
of all mankind
a few steps higher.

17:21.583 --> 17:23.460
Higher consciousness.

17:23.501 --> 17:26.421
Yeah, uh,

17:26.463 --> 17:28.923
I remember
that first billboard

17:28.965 --> 17:31.092
so differently.

17:39.851 --> 17:41.978
What the fuck?

17:44.064 --> 17:45.648
She might as well
have been naked up there.

17:45.690 --> 17:47.275
My eyes were just glued

17:47.317 --> 17:49.944
to those two blimps
for breasts.

17:49.986 --> 17:52.781
<i>But then I noticed the number</i>
<i>for management,</i>

17:52.822 --> 17:55.241
<i>and it was</i>
<i>my dad's office number.</i>

17:56.826 --> 18:01.331
You have to understand,

18:01.373 --> 18:03.667
gentle,

18:03.708 --> 18:07.796
childlike, um,
and he adored my mother.

18:07.837 --> 18:11.800
- Before you, Angelyne,
I didn't believe.

18:11.841 --> 18:13.802
I didn't disbelieve.
I just...

18:13.843 --> 18:17.305
<i>- But his relationship</i>
<i>with Angelyne</i>

18:17.347 --> 18:19.432
<i>crossed every boundary.</i>

18:19.474 --> 18:22.018
<i>He was like a teenager</i>
<i>with her.</i>

18:22.060 --> 18:24.604
- Of course Harold and I
talked a lot,

18:24.646 --> 18:26.481
but it was always
about business.

18:26.523 --> 18:28.983
<i>It was a busy,</i>
<i>busy, busy time.</i>

18:29.025 --> 18:30.235
<i>Oh!</i>

18:30.276 --> 18:33.321
- Yet here I am,
awake at last,

18:33.363 --> 18:35.532
and seeing it all
makes me weep.

18:35.573 --> 18:37.659
- You are such a poet,
darling Harold,

18:37.701 --> 18:40.412
but right now, I need more
than flowery phrases

18:40.453 --> 18:41.996
to keep expanding.

18:42.038 --> 18:44.082
Have you checked out the corner
of Beverly and Western?

18:44.124 --> 18:46.710
- I'm pretty sure that one's
with Foster & Kleiser.

18:46.751 --> 18:49.379
Plus, they always overvalue.
- I'll talk to them then.

18:49.421 --> 18:51.673
They are not going to say no
to me.

18:51.715 --> 18:53.675
How 'bout Santa Monica
and Crescent Heights?

18:53.717 --> 18:55.176
- You really think it's worth
the asking price?

18:55.218 --> 18:58.471
- I wanna get to ten billboards
by the end of the year.

18:58.513 --> 19:00.265
Have you looked
at my updated list?

19:00.306 --> 19:01.558
- Uh, yes.

19:01.599 --> 19:04.185
- And?
- Yes, I'm reading it

19:04.227 --> 19:06.021
as we speak.

19:06.062 --> 19:07.689
Uh, yep.

19:07.731 --> 19:08.773
How do you have
a sprinkler guy?

19:08.815 --> 19:10.316
I don't even have
a sprinkler guy.

19:10.358 --> 19:13.028
- I don't have a sprinkler guy.

19:13.069 --> 19:16.072
The sprinkler guy simply exists
to offer his services,

19:16.114 --> 19:18.658
and it's up to me
to balance the scales.

19:18.700 --> 19:20.160
You understand?
- Not really, no.

19:20.201 --> 19:22.704
- I don't know why
the entire world doesn't work

19:22.746 --> 19:24.456
on a barter system.

19:24.497 --> 19:26.916
Let's say Tom wants
an autographed photo

19:26.958 --> 19:29.544
of Angelyne.
Now, Tom...

19:29.586 --> 19:32.589
Just so happens to
be an irrigation specialist,

19:32.630 --> 19:33.882
so rather than money,

19:33.923 --> 19:37.093
I trade him
for a new sprinkler system.

19:37.135 --> 19:39.429
Now, Dick owns

19:39.471 --> 19:42.098
the billboard space
that I want.

19:42.140 --> 19:44.893
Dick just so happens
to be desperate

19:44.934 --> 19:48.813
for a new sprinkler system,
so I connect Tom and Dick,

19:48.855 --> 19:49.981
and mwah.

19:50.023 --> 19:51.566
Ooh, voilà.

19:51.608 --> 19:53.193
<i>I get a new billboard.</i>

19:53.234 --> 19:54.486
<i>Oh!</i>

19:54.527 --> 19:57.614
- Everywhere you turned,
there she was.

19:57.655 --> 19:59.366
People like to talk
about water cooler moments

19:59.407 --> 20:00.658
in pop culture today.

20:00.700 --> 20:05.914
In 1980s LA,
Angelyne was the water cooler.

20:05.955 --> 20:09.584
- This show is gonna make you
so famous.

20:09.626 --> 20:11.628
Soon there'll be
Wendy lunch boxes,

20:11.670 --> 20:13.338
a Wendy backpack.

20:13.380 --> 20:15.340
- I'm so ready.

20:15.382 --> 20:18.176
It's finally happening.

20:18.218 --> 20:21.262
I mean, I know I'm only 19,
but still.

20:21.304 --> 20:22.347
- Don't get surprised

20:22.389 --> 20:24.516
if the camera adds
a little weight.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.643
If you wanna stay thin,
chew on ice.

20:26.685 --> 20:28.978
<i>- I was starring</i>
<i>in my own sitcom.</i>

20:29.020 --> 20:32.816
<i>Millions dream of this moment,</i>
<i>and I was living it.</i>

20:32.857 --> 20:35.276
<i>But sure enough,</i>
<i>Angelyne found a way in.</i>

20:35.318 --> 20:38.655
- Guess who just had
another Angelyne sighting.

20:38.697 --> 20:40.782
Second time this month.
- Ooh.

20:40.824 --> 20:42.742
That is good luck.
- You guys,

20:42.784 --> 20:45.412
I just saw her yesterday
at the Chevron in Melrose.

20:45.453 --> 20:46.996
She gave me her business card

20:47.038 --> 20:50.959
while her sugar daddy
was pumping her gas.

20:51.001 --> 20:52.877
- He's probably getting
something in return.

20:52.919 --> 20:55.296
- Maybe I'll call him so I can
get in on the billboard game

20:55.338 --> 20:57.799
once this show
inevitably crashes and burns.

20:57.841 --> 20:59.467
- We should totally call
the number.

20:59.509 --> 21:01.553
- Oh, my gosh.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.805
- Oh, we are so bad.

21:03.847 --> 21:05.682
- Hey,
just planning out my future.

21:05.724 --> 21:07.517
And if I gotta sleep my way
up...

21:07.559 --> 21:08.810
- Mm, here we go.

21:08.852 --> 21:10.895
<i>- Thank you</i>
<i>for calling Angelyne.</i>

21:10.937 --> 21:13.732
<i>You can leave</i>
<i>a magnificent message.</i>

21:13.773 --> 21:16.484
- Hey, Angelyne's manager.

21:16.526 --> 21:18.194
This is--
- Stop it!

21:18.236 --> 21:20.155
Fucking stop!

21:27.704 --> 21:28.830
- The phone
would not stop ringing.

21:28.872 --> 21:31.458
There were fans calling
from every corner

21:31.499 --> 21:33.084
of the solar system.

21:33.126 --> 21:34.878
<i>- I just really feel</i>
<i>like we're connected</i>

21:34.919 --> 21:36.129
<i>in a cosmic way.</i>
- Mm.

21:36.171 --> 21:37.339
<i>- Angelyne,</i>

21:37.380 --> 21:39.132
<i>I just think</i>
<i>you're so beautiful.</i>

21:39.174 --> 21:41.343
- That's sweet.
<i>- Angelyne, will you marry me?</i>

21:41.384 --> 21:43.928
<i>- Oh, Angelyne.</i>

21:43.970 --> 21:45.638
- Oh, God.

21:45.680 --> 21:47.432
<i>- Ah.</i>
- Least he knows my name.

21:47.474 --> 21:49.517
Whoo.

21:49.559 --> 21:51.102
<i>- This is Joe Haywood</i>
<i>at the "LA Times."</i>

21:51.144 --> 21:53.229
<i>I'd love to set up</i>
<i>an interview with Angelyne.</i>

21:53.271 --> 21:55.190
- "LA Times."
That's the big leagues.

21:55.231 --> 21:56.941
- Make him give you a list
of the questions

21:56.983 --> 21:58.610
so I can approve them first.

21:58.651 --> 22:00.320
- I don't think
he's gonna do that.

22:00.362 --> 22:02.238
<i>- Hi,</i>
<i>I'm producing a movie,</i>

22:02.280 --> 22:04.574
<i>and the director is a big fan</i>
<i>of yours</i>

22:04.616 --> 22:06.493
<i>and has specifically requested</i>
<i>to see you audition</i>

22:06.534 --> 22:08.036
<i>for the part.</i>

22:08.078 --> 22:09.621
<i>Uh, call me back for details.</i>

22:09.662 --> 22:13.291
<i>213-109-0248.</i>

22:13.333 --> 22:14.584
<i>Ciao for now.</i>
<i>I look forward to it.</i>

22:16.169 --> 22:19.422
Do you have
any acting experience?

22:19.464 --> 22:20.799
- I've dipped a toe in.

22:20.840 --> 22:21.800
- Yes, but can you act?

22:21.841 --> 22:23.009
I've seen Wendy rehearsing.

22:23.051 --> 22:25.679
It takes a lot of work.

22:25.720 --> 22:28.264
- I've lived to be Angelyne
this long.

22:28.306 --> 22:30.850
- Hello, yes.
Uh, my name is Harold Wallach.

22:30.892 --> 22:33.186
I am returning a call regarding
Angelyne.

22:35.605 --> 22:37.023
Yes, that Angelyne.

22:37.065 --> 22:38.900
<i>- Marketing drives</i>
<i>the industry,</i>

22:38.942 --> 22:41.653
and I had a built-in fan base.

22:41.695 --> 22:43.655
Nowadays, it's all about

22:43.697 --> 22:47.492
how many Instagram followers
you have,

22:47.534 --> 22:49.494
all of which is nonsense,

22:49.536 --> 22:51.329
but I started all that.

22:51.371 --> 22:53.873
With my billboards
all over Hollywood,

22:53.915 --> 22:56.668
movie studios were begging
for me.

22:56.710 --> 22:57.961
Okay.
- Are you ready?

22:58.003 --> 22:59.004
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

22:59.045 --> 23:00.171
- And I'm Samantha?
- Yep.

23:00.213 --> 23:01.381
- Okay.

23:03.174 --> 23:05.176
- I'm busy, Samantha.
Not right now.

23:07.470 --> 23:09.514
That was your cue.

23:09.556 --> 23:10.515
- Me?
- Yeah.

23:10.557 --> 23:13.351
- Oh.

23:13.393 --> 23:15.103
I'm sorry.
Hold on.

23:17.772 --> 23:19.858
Oh, right. Sorry.
Okay, okay.

23:19.899 --> 23:23.028
If not now,
then when, Steve?

23:23.069 --> 23:26.573
It's always work, work, work
for you.

23:26.614 --> 23:28.533
- Uh, okay.
Do it softer

23:28.575 --> 23:31.327
and, um, sexier.

23:37.625 --> 23:41.755
- If not now,
then when, Steve?

23:41.796 --> 23:45.091
It's always work, work, work

23:45.133 --> 23:46.259
for you.

23:46.301 --> 23:48.261
- Yeah, good.

23:48.303 --> 23:49.471
Really good, okay.

23:49.512 --> 23:50.597
Um, let's try it again,

23:50.638 --> 23:52.724
so let's sit down for this one.

23:52.766 --> 23:53.933
Come on.

23:55.435 --> 23:59.356
Okay, um,
so it needs to sound feminine,

23:59.397 --> 24:02.484
but still
with some aggression, okay?

24:04.110 --> 24:05.362
Try it.
- Oh.

24:05.403 --> 24:06.738
- I'm busy, Samantha.
- Okay.

24:06.780 --> 24:08.782
- Not right now.
- Just.

24:08.823 --> 24:09.991
If not now, then--

24:10.033 --> 24:11.659
- Whoa. No, no, no.
What are you doing?

24:15.205 --> 24:16.414
- Why are you laughing?

24:16.456 --> 24:18.416
- Angelyne,
I'm asking you to tease.

24:18.458 --> 24:19.959
That's not hard.

24:20.001 --> 24:21.086
And you said yourself
you've been teasing men

24:21.127 --> 24:23.588
from a young age, right?

24:23.630 --> 24:25.507
- All right...

24:25.548 --> 24:26.966
- So tease me.

24:45.235 --> 24:47.612
<i>- Mm.</i>

24:54.869 --> 24:56.621
- I was
completely disrespected.

24:56.663 --> 24:59.249
- I am so, so sorry.

24:59.290 --> 25:00.917
I should've done more vetting.

25:00.959 --> 25:04.254
It's so unprofessional of them,
of me.

25:04.295 --> 25:05.964
- I do not wanna be put
in a position

25:06.006 --> 25:07.007
like that ever again.

25:07.048 --> 25:08.216
And that "LA Times" guy?

25:08.258 --> 25:09.718
He didn't ask any
of the questions

25:09.759 --> 25:11.094
that I wanted him to ask.
- I know.

25:11.136 --> 25:13.513
- He kept asking
where I was born, and my age,

25:13.555 --> 25:14.931
and about my family,

25:14.973 --> 25:16.141
and none of that matters.

25:16.182 --> 25:17.892
- No, you're absolutely right.

25:19.227 --> 25:23.481
Okay, you have qualities
that produce visions.

25:23.523 --> 25:24.649
All right?

25:24.691 --> 25:26.317
And these celebrity leeches--

25:26.359 --> 25:29.404
they focus on tabloid gossip.

25:29.446 --> 25:32.073
Now perhaps you have become
too accessible to people...

25:32.115 --> 25:34.117
- I'm done acting.
- And that is my fault.

25:34.159 --> 25:36.411
- I don't wanna be famous
for something that I do.

25:36.453 --> 25:38.913
I wanna be famous for who I am.
- Right.

25:38.955 --> 25:40.331
- I will only be Angelyne.
- Right.

25:40.373 --> 25:42.500
And that is all you ever need
to be.

25:42.542 --> 25:45.670
You don't have to be anything
or anyone

25:45.712 --> 25:47.964
other than Angelyne ever again.

25:48.006 --> 25:49.424
I promise you that.

25:51.760 --> 25:53.845
- I believe in you.

25:55.930 --> 25:57.599
- Thank you, Daddykins.
- All right.

25:58.683 --> 26:00.852
- Try and get some sleep.

26:08.276 --> 26:12.238
My father was officially living
on another planet,

26:12.280 --> 26:14.866
while I was in dire need of him
on this one.

26:14.908 --> 26:20.038
But Dad, this is truly, totally
what I wanna do with my life.

26:20.080 --> 26:22.707
If you don't believe in me,
well,

26:22.749 --> 26:24.250
I don't know what I'll do.

26:24.292 --> 26:27.337
- I do believe in you, honey.

26:27.379 --> 26:28.922
- Yeah?

26:28.963 --> 26:31.841
- I truly, totally do.

26:31.883 --> 26:33.468
- Cut and reset.

26:33.510 --> 26:34.886
- Shoot, sorry,
did I step on your line?

26:34.928 --> 26:36.137
- No, no, no, no.
You're fine.

26:36.179 --> 26:37.472
- Good.
Whew.

26:37.514 --> 26:39.307
Thanks.

26:41.142 --> 26:43.812
I'm gonna miss this.

26:43.853 --> 26:45.814
Wendy, you're a sweetheart.

26:45.855 --> 26:47.399
Keep your chin up.
You'll do great.

26:49.234 --> 26:51.486
- Wait,
are you leaving the show?

26:52.987 --> 26:54.948
- They haven't told you.

26:56.741 --> 26:58.034
Goddamn sons of bitches.

26:58.076 --> 26:59.202
- Told me what?

26:59.244 --> 27:00.745
- Back to one.
Back to one.

27:00.787 --> 27:02.122
Last looks, please.

27:02.163 --> 27:04.916
- What, Mike?

27:04.958 --> 27:06.751
- We're canceled, kid.

27:06.793 --> 27:08.378
- Sound speed!

27:08.420 --> 27:09.963
From the top.
- What?

27:10.005 --> 27:12.173
- Background.
Action!

27:12.215 --> 27:13.508
- I want the best for you,

27:13.550 --> 27:17.262
but the music business is
brutal and unforgiving.

27:17.303 --> 27:20.098
It's okay
to give up on your dreams.

27:20.140 --> 27:21.683
No one'll judge.

27:25.478 --> 27:28.023
- But Dad, this is truly,
totally what I want to do

27:28.064 --> 27:30.567
with my life.

27:30.608 --> 27:33.486
If you don't believe in me,
I don't know what I'll do.

27:43.747 --> 27:45.457
- Wendy, I know you're worried
about the camera,

27:45.498 --> 27:47.417
but there's, uh--
there's no MSG.

27:49.085 --> 27:52.088
Mm.

27:52.130 --> 27:54.841
- Did you know
my show got canceled?

27:54.883 --> 27:56.301
- Hm?

27:57.677 --> 28:00.096
- Last week.

28:00.138 --> 28:02.474
Kept waiting for you to ask.

28:02.515 --> 28:06.728
- Oh, my God, I am so sorry,
Wendy.

28:08.646 --> 28:10.857
You know,
that--that really gripes me.

28:10.899 --> 28:12.734
I never saw any advertising.

28:12.776 --> 28:15.111
You want viewers,
you have to advertise.

28:15.153 --> 28:16.404
Maybe I can put up
some billboards.

28:16.446 --> 28:17.697
- No, Dad.
It's done.

28:17.739 --> 28:19.407
You can't fix it.

28:19.449 --> 28:23.078
- Have you ever heard
of the word "penopotist"?

28:23.119 --> 28:24.579
- That's not a word.

28:24.621 --> 28:27.749
- It means that you can take...

28:27.791 --> 28:30.960
any impossible situation,

28:31.002 --> 28:32.420
turn it around.

28:32.462 --> 28:34.255
You make it possible.

28:34.297 --> 28:37.842
Just focus on the positive.

28:37.884 --> 28:39.386
That's how Angelyne lives.

28:39.427 --> 28:40.929
I gotta say,
the results are stunning.

28:42.639 --> 28:43.765
- I don't want to hear
another word

28:43.807 --> 28:45.392
about bloody Angelyne.

28:45.433 --> 28:46.851
- That's very negative, honey.
- Oh, well.

28:46.893 --> 28:49.437
- Very negative.

28:49.479 --> 28:52.691
Listen, she's not
a penopotist...

28:52.732 --> 28:54.442
for sure.

28:57.862 --> 29:00.281
- Why do you spend so much time
with her?

29:00.323 --> 29:01.950
- We work together.

29:01.991 --> 29:02.951
She needs me.

29:02.992 --> 29:04.119
- We need you.

29:05.662 --> 29:07.414
Mom needs you.

29:07.455 --> 29:10.500
Do you want a divorce?
- I think you're overreacting.

29:10.542 --> 29:12.293
- Dad, she doesn't even have
any talent.

29:12.335 --> 29:14.796
- That's her talent.
- But I have real talent!

29:14.838 --> 29:16.172
- Exactly.

29:16.214 --> 29:18.842
That's why you don't need me
the way that she does.

29:18.883 --> 29:21.803
But if you do, my God,
I am here for you always.

29:21.845 --> 29:23.847
I just told you I'd put up
a billboard for you.

29:23.888 --> 29:25.265
- That's not the point.

29:32.689 --> 29:33.815
I, um...

29:37.444 --> 29:38.903
Please eat something.

29:38.945 --> 29:40.405
Please, Wendy.

29:49.497 --> 29:51.833
<i>- The world is a cruel place,</i>

29:51.875 --> 29:55.503
<i>and we're all just trying</i>
<i>to get by,</i>

29:55.545 --> 29:58.214
whatever way we know best.

29:58.256 --> 30:00.133
And once you figure
out what works,

30:00.175 --> 30:02.802
you just keep moving
on forward...

30:04.971 --> 30:08.683
No matter the roadblocks
that stand in your way.

30:08.725 --> 30:11.603
<i>- It was 1984, I think.</i>
- Next.

30:11.644 --> 30:14.147
<i>- I was auditioning full-time</i>
<i>then, you know,</i>

30:14.189 --> 30:17.984
<i>usually for guest spots,</i>
<i>three-episode arcs.</i>

30:18.026 --> 30:21.321
<i>And I saw the Corvette.</i>

30:25.992 --> 30:27.035
- Thank you so much.

30:31.206 --> 30:32.374
Angelyne!

30:34.459 --> 30:37.337
It was primal.

30:37.379 --> 30:39.339
I must key her car.

30:39.381 --> 30:42.217
I have no choice.

30:42.258 --> 30:44.052
I'm Harold Wallach's daughter.

30:44.094 --> 30:45.387
You probably don't remember me,

30:45.428 --> 30:47.055
but I thought
I should reintroduce myself,

30:47.097 --> 30:49.349
seeing as that you're such
a big part of my family's life.

30:49.391 --> 30:50.975
- Hi.

30:51.017 --> 30:53.561
Harold has told me so much
about you.

30:53.603 --> 30:54.854
- Oh, I'm sure.
Yeah.

30:54.896 --> 30:56.606
- I love your hair.
It's so pretty.

30:56.648 --> 30:58.358
<i>- I didn't want a compliment</i>
<i>from her.</i>

30:58.400 --> 31:00.735
<i>I was here to unleash rage.</i>

31:00.777 --> 31:02.487
- Are you here for an audition?

31:02.529 --> 31:04.572
Harold told me
you're auditioning again.

31:04.614 --> 31:06.408
- Yeah, but that's--

31:06.449 --> 31:07.492
- What were you auditioning
for?

31:07.534 --> 31:08.702
- To play a dead hooker.

31:08.743 --> 31:12.247
It was for a guest spot
on "The A-Team."

31:12.288 --> 31:15.375
- I don't know, I swear
she said it was a dead hooker.

31:15.417 --> 31:16.584
Why would I lie?

31:16.626 --> 31:18.128
- They wouldn't hold auditions
for a--

31:18.169 --> 31:19.713
- Dead hooker.

31:19.754 --> 31:21.256
So scandalous.

31:21.297 --> 31:23.299
- That's not what I said.

31:23.341 --> 31:25.385
What--what are you even doing
here?

31:25.427 --> 31:27.095
- Oh, I'm in a movie.

31:27.137 --> 31:30.640
Yeah, look,
that's my trailer right there.

31:30.682 --> 31:32.017
Hm.

31:32.058 --> 31:33.435
It's fit for a queen, right?

31:33.476 --> 31:34.811
- You--you don't act.

31:34.853 --> 31:37.647
- I know.
I'm playing myself.

31:37.689 --> 31:39.441
Yeah,
I didn't even have to audition.

31:39.482 --> 31:42.318
Just gave them a list
of my demands and--ooh--

31:42.360 --> 31:45.989
they met every single one,
so here I am.

31:46.031 --> 31:48.324
- Are you sleeping
with my father?

31:52.871 --> 31:54.831
- No, I'm not.

31:54.873 --> 31:57.334
- I believed her.

31:57.375 --> 31:59.252
Yeah,
her relationship with my father

31:59.294 --> 32:00.378
was never sexual.

32:00.420 --> 32:01.629
It was emotional...

32:01.671 --> 32:04.466
Which was worse.

32:04.507 --> 32:07.052
What are you even doing
with him?

32:07.093 --> 32:08.136
He's not a manager.

32:08.178 --> 32:09.471
He's a printer.

32:09.512 --> 32:12.390
- It has nothing to do
with you.

32:12.432 --> 32:15.268
- He's my dad, not yours.

32:17.520 --> 32:18.813
- Now you've crossed a line.

32:18.855 --> 32:21.941
- Are you kidding?
You--no, you crossed the line

32:21.983 --> 32:25.445
way before I ever came close
to the line.

32:25.487 --> 32:26.613
- You're just upset

32:26.654 --> 32:30.533
because your little show
got canceled.

32:30.575 --> 32:33.620
<i>- She knew exactly</i>
<i>how to hurt me most.</i>

32:33.661 --> 32:35.497
Stop calling my house.

32:35.538 --> 32:36.998
It upsets my mother.

32:37.040 --> 32:38.208
- I love your mother.

32:38.249 --> 32:40.418
- You don't even know
my mother, Angelyne!

32:40.460 --> 32:42.003
She hates you!

32:42.045 --> 32:46.675
Just go get your own family
and stay the hell outta mine!

32:46.716 --> 32:48.343
- Wendy, how are you?

32:50.720 --> 32:53.807
- I think she was jealous
of everything.

32:53.848 --> 32:57.018
Really, my fame, my success.

32:57.060 --> 33:01.022
She tried acting,
but it didn't work out.

33:01.064 --> 33:04.859
Meanwhile, her father invested
millions of dollars in me,

33:04.901 --> 33:06.778
and it paid off.

33:09.531 --> 33:12.367
Wouldn't you be jealous?

33:52.407 --> 33:53.742
- Here she is.

33:53.783 --> 33:56.202
30 minutes late
and right on time.

33:56.244 --> 33:59.205
Angelyne, meet Lou and Sheldon.

33:59.247 --> 34:02.709
- Lou and Sheldon, mm.

34:02.751 --> 34:05.086
Such strong names.

34:05.128 --> 34:07.297
Nice to meet you, Angelyne.

34:07.339 --> 34:09.632
- So boys, what is this about?

34:09.674 --> 34:13.261
Harold tells me you're a fan
of Angelyne.

34:13.303 --> 34:14.679
Me too.

34:14.721 --> 34:17.557
- Well,
as I was just telling Harold,

34:17.599 --> 34:19.059
uh, your billboard
at Sunset and Vine

34:19.100 --> 34:21.227
is in a prime location
for one of our clients.

34:21.269 --> 34:22.687
- Hm, who's the client?

34:22.729 --> 34:24.272
- We'd like to take over
the lease contract,

34:24.314 --> 34:26.608
and we're willing to throw in
a couple thousand extra

34:26.649 --> 34:27.817
to sweeten the deal.

34:27.859 --> 34:30.028
It's a very generous offer.

34:30.070 --> 34:31.529
- Well...

34:31.571 --> 34:34.449
gentlemen, this is not
my decision to make.

34:34.491 --> 34:36.117
Please talk to my partner.

34:41.331 --> 34:42.791
Um...

34:42.832 --> 34:46.086
no offense, but this might be
above your head.

34:52.008 --> 34:57.555
- Mm, I--I just--I don't see
anything up there.

34:57.597 --> 34:59.349
Listen, Sheldon,
it's not a generous offer.

34:59.391 --> 35:01.059
It's a joke.
You really think

35:01.101 --> 35:04.479
that I would let go
of Sunset and Vine

35:04.521 --> 35:07.315
for a couple thousand dollars?

35:07.357 --> 35:08.525
If you want that space,

35:08.566 --> 35:09.776
you give me
ten of your billboards,

35:09.818 --> 35:12.570
including the one
on Lankershim and Vineland.

35:12.612 --> 35:14.531
Remember?

35:14.572 --> 35:16.658
I wanted that one.

35:21.204 --> 35:22.539
- We'll give you four,

35:22.580 --> 35:23.832
but not Lankershim.

35:23.873 --> 35:27.002
- Eight, and Lankershim is
nonnegotiable.

35:27.043 --> 35:29.004
- Six.

35:29.045 --> 35:30.839
With Lankershim.
- No soup.

35:30.880 --> 35:32.799
What's "No soup"?

35:32.841 --> 35:34.676
- It's from her favorite movie.

35:34.718 --> 35:36.344
- It means
you do not have a deal.

35:36.386 --> 35:38.096
You know my demands,
and if you can't meet them,

35:38.138 --> 35:42.350
then I don't see any reason
to continue this conversation.

35:42.392 --> 35:45.311
Oh, wait.

35:45.353 --> 35:48.857
This is Harold's office, so...

35:48.898 --> 35:51.026
I guess you two should leave.

35:55.697 --> 35:57.490
- Fine.

35:57.532 --> 35:59.409
Eight.

35:59.451 --> 36:00.994
- I'm back up at ten now.

36:01.036 --> 36:03.872
You two have been
so very disrespectful.

36:15.508 --> 36:18.261
- I think it was 2001.

36:18.303 --> 36:20.221
Right, 'cause I was pregnant
with my first kid.

36:20.263 --> 36:24.225
<i>And I hadn't seen Angelyne</i>
<i>since before I left</i>

36:24.267 --> 36:25.727
<i>for college.</i>

36:27.604 --> 36:28.813
<i>And then I saw the Corvette.</i>

36:31.608 --> 36:36.488
<i>All of that rage just came</i>
<i>rushing back.</i>

36:38.198 --> 36:42.077
<i>Ugh, there was just</i>
<i>no escaping her.</i>

36:42.118 --> 36:44.204
Angelyne?

36:45.789 --> 36:47.665
Wendy.

36:47.707 --> 36:48.750
Harold's daughter.

36:48.792 --> 36:51.378
- Oh, hi.

36:51.419 --> 36:53.254
Course I remember you.

37:06.393 --> 37:08.228
How far along are you?

37:08.269 --> 37:09.354
- Six months.

37:09.396 --> 37:10.855
- Is it a boy, a girl?

37:10.897 --> 37:12.440
Do you have a name yet?

37:12.482 --> 37:16.528
- It's a boy, and, uh,
no name just yet.

37:16.569 --> 37:17.821
Any suggestions?

37:17.862 --> 37:20.532
- It's something
for the baby to choose.

37:20.573 --> 37:23.201
- Hmm.

37:23.243 --> 37:27.080
- How is my darling Harold
doing?

37:27.122 --> 37:29.874
- He, um, had a stroke
last month.

37:31.668 --> 37:35.547
- Oh.
Oh, no.

37:35.588 --> 37:37.590
I wish I'd known.
Is he okay?

37:37.632 --> 37:39.050
- We think so.

37:39.092 --> 37:41.344
It wasn't too severe.

37:41.386 --> 37:44.431
He's, uh--
he's getting up there.

37:44.472 --> 37:46.391
- Are you okay?

37:46.433 --> 37:47.684
- Yeah.

37:47.726 --> 37:50.854
I--I have no choice to be.
Baby.

37:50.895 --> 37:52.605
- Hmm.

37:54.149 --> 37:56.901
Have you seen my new magazine?

37:56.943 --> 37:58.069
- I have, actually.

37:58.111 --> 37:59.779
I bought a copy
a couple months ago.

37:59.821 --> 38:01.406
- You did?

38:01.448 --> 38:03.950
- Oh, I can't believe
I just admitted that to you.

38:03.992 --> 38:05.410
- Don't be silly.

38:05.452 --> 38:07.078
I have a lot of stalkers.

38:07.120 --> 38:08.455
- No, I'm not a stalker.

38:08.496 --> 38:10.081
- Well...

38:10.123 --> 38:11.499
Here's the new one.
- Okay.

38:11.541 --> 38:13.835
- It's $50, but I'll give it
to you for $20.

38:13.877 --> 38:15.879
It's an ultra-phenomenal
discount

38:15.920 --> 38:18.798
for an ultra-phenomenal person.

38:18.840 --> 38:20.925
- Thank you.

38:20.967 --> 38:23.428
<i>A real conversation</i>
<i>with Angelyne.</i>

38:23.470 --> 38:27.265
<i>Took me a long time</i>
<i>and a lot of hard work</i>

38:27.307 --> 38:30.393
<i>to realize she never really</i>
<i>was a threat to me</i>

38:30.435 --> 38:31.853
<i>or my career.</i>

38:31.895 --> 38:33.271
The funny thing is,
she ended up being

38:33.313 --> 38:35.982
a big part
of my healing process.

38:36.024 --> 38:37.275
Please don't do this
to Mom.

38:37.317 --> 38:40.028
<i>I wrote, directed, and starred</i>

38:40.070 --> 38:41.571
<i>in a one-woman show</i>

38:41.613 --> 38:44.908
<i>about my experience</i>
<i>growing up in the shadow</i>

38:44.949 --> 38:48.912
<i>of the Angelyne billboards,</i>
<i>called "Los Angelyne."</i>

38:48.953 --> 38:50.830
<i>It was cathartic.</i>

38:50.872 --> 38:53.625
I just decided
I had to be done

38:53.667 --> 38:55.335
being mad at her and my father.

38:55.377 --> 38:59.130
I just had to.
It was exhausting.

38:59.172 --> 39:02.884
I mean, they were never
really trying to hurt anyone.

39:02.926 --> 39:04.135
Did she make his dreams
come true?

39:04.177 --> 39:05.929
No.
He'll never become famous.

39:05.970 --> 39:07.806
He'll only be a footnote
in the story of Angelyne,

39:07.847 --> 39:10.809
which is itself a footnote

39:10.850 --> 39:13.144
in the story of Los Angeles.

39:13.186 --> 39:17.941
But... she did take him
on a great ride.

39:21.027 --> 39:22.946
- I'd slow--
slow down a touch.

39:22.987 --> 39:24.197
- Harold.

39:24.239 --> 39:25.990
I'm a rebel, darling.

39:26.032 --> 39:27.158
You can't tell me
what to do.

39:27.200 --> 39:28.785
Well, if this is how I go,

39:28.827 --> 39:30.870
then I--I couldn't be happier.

39:33.915 --> 39:35.709
- What about a wall?

39:35.750 --> 39:37.168
Yeah, a wall.

39:37.210 --> 39:39.004
Nobody has ever done that
before.

39:39.045 --> 39:40.296
The Hollywood Plaza
has a wall,

39:40.338 --> 39:41.923
and it's boring and blank.

39:41.965 --> 39:44.092
- I'll look into it.
I've been thinking--

39:44.134 --> 39:45.343
- About making a movie
of my life?

39:45.385 --> 39:46.344
Me too.

39:46.386 --> 39:47.721
- Yes, sure.
I like that.

39:47.762 --> 39:50.223
I like it, but what
about an Angelyne doll?

39:50.265 --> 39:52.142
That is naughty.

39:52.183 --> 39:53.768
Can it be life-size?

39:53.810 --> 39:55.228
- Of course,
and photorealistic.

39:55.270 --> 39:57.689
- I love it.
I love it.

39:57.731 --> 39:59.024
You know
what I've been thinking?

39:59.065 --> 40:02.277
- Hmm?
What's that?

40:02.318 --> 40:04.946
- Buckle up.
- I'm buckled.

40:04.988 --> 40:06.865
Jesus Christ.
No, no, no, no!

40:06.906 --> 40:08.408
Don't!
God!

40:08.450 --> 40:10.201
- Open your eyes.

41:35.662 --> 41:38.665
- Harold was different
than Cory.

41:38.707 --> 41:42.627
Harold was...

41:42.669 --> 41:45.839
different than all
the other men in my life.

41:45.880 --> 41:47.298
- Did the rumors bother you?

41:47.340 --> 41:50.135
- Oh, God, no.
Mm-mm.

41:50.176 --> 41:51.511
People can think
what they want

41:51.553 --> 41:53.722
as long as they're thinking
of me.

41:53.763 --> 41:55.223
Ooh!

41:55.265 --> 41:57.475
When I was a kid,
I used to see your billboards

41:57.517 --> 41:59.602
and think, "Who is
that beautiful woman,

41:59.644 --> 42:01.146
and what's her story?"

42:01.187 --> 42:04.733
Now, finally, many years later,
I get to ask.

42:04.774 --> 42:08.028
- Who is Angelyne?

42:08.069 --> 42:10.947
I'm something
you have to feel,

42:10.989 --> 42:15.827
something you have
to experience.

42:15.869 --> 42:18.329
If you really wanna know,

42:18.371 --> 42:21.458
you have to come with me.
