09:12.250 --> 09:13.239
ARE NOT HERE TO CAUSE
ANY TROUBLE.

09:13.280 --> 09:15.168
THEY JUST HAVE
A FEW QUESTIONS TO ASK.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.127
- AS A FORMER MEMBER
OF THIS INSTITUTION

09:31.170 --> 09:33.229
AND A DECORATED SOLDIER,

09:33.270 --> 09:35.738
PERHAPS YOU CAN EXPLAIN
TO THESE CIVILIANS

09:35.770 --> 09:38.068
THAT WHILE THE UNITED STATES
ARMY APPRECIATES THEIR CONCERNS

09:38.110 --> 09:39.737
ABOUT PRIVATE STARKS,

09:39.780 --> 09:41.304
THIS IS A MILITARY MATTER.

09:41.340 --> 09:43.877
- ABSOLUTELY, GENERAL.
BUT A SOLDIER IS DEAD.

09:43.910 --> 09:45.571
I THINK THESE PEOPLE ARE JUST
TRYING TO DO

09:45.610 --> 09:47.578
THEIR DUE DILIGENCE.

09:47.620 --> 09:49.713
- I ASSURE YOU WE WILL CONDUCT
A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION

09:49.750 --> 09:51.388
INTERNALLY HERE ON OUR BASE.

09:51.420 --> 09:54.116
- YEAH, SEE, HERE'S THE THING--
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN ON YOUR BASE.

09:54.160 --> 09:57.049
SO YOU AND I CAN SIT HERE
AND HAGGLE OVER JURISDICTION,

09:57.090 --> 09:59.126
WHICH WE BOTH KNOW IS MURKY
AT BEST.

09:59.160 --> 10:00.627
OR YOU CAN GIVE US ACCESS
TO YOUR BASE,

10:00.660 --> 10:02.196
LET US DO OUR WORK.

10:04.700 --> 10:07.134
- YOU MAY BE INTERESTED TO KNOW
THAT THE CORONER FOUND EVIDENCE

10:07.170 --> 10:08.728
THAT MAY CONFLICT
WITH THE ORIGINAL THEORY

10:08.770 --> 10:09.737
OF SELF-INFLICT ION.

10:09.770 --> 10:11.533
- THANK YOU, YOUNG LADY.

10:11.570 --> 10:14.004
I'LL BE HAPPY
TO PASS THAT REPORT ON

10:14.040 --> 10:17.043
TO OUR HIGHLY SKILLED
MILITARY PATHOLOGIST.

10:17.080 --> 10:20.277
- MAJOR GENERAL...
- YES?

10:20.320 --> 10:23.414
- I GOT NOTHING.
I JUST LIKE SAYING THAT.

10:23.450 --> 10:26.715
THOSE TWO WORDS IN SEQUENCE.
"MAJOR GENERAL."

10:26.760 --> 10:28.079
TRY IT, GUS.
- I DON'T WANT TO, SHAWN.

10:28.120 --> 10:29.280
- JUST SAY IT.
- I DON'T WANT TO .

10:29.320 --> 10:33.256
- SAY IT.
- MAJOR GENERAL.

10:33.300 --> 10:36.019
[knock on door]

10:36.060 --> 10:38.369
- GENERAL,
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE

10:38.400 --> 10:39.765
WITH STARKS' PARENTS.

10:39.800 --> 10:41.131
THEY'VE REQUESTED THAT
WE PUT TOGETHER HIS THINGS

10:41.170 --> 10:42.159
FOR THEM TO PICK UP.

10:42.200 --> 10:43.701
- THANK YOU,
LIEUTENANT WALLACH.

10:43.740 --> 10:44.729
YES, I SPOKE
TO THE BOY'S PARENTS

10:44.770 --> 10:46.829
THIS MORNING MYSELF.

10:46.880 --> 10:49.030
HARDEST CALL THE ARMY
HAS TO MAKE.

10:49.080 --> 10:50.502
[cell phone tinkles]

10:50.550 --> 10:53.110
WHAT IS THAT?
- SORRY, SIR.

10:53.150 --> 10:54.879
IT'S MY GIRLFRIEND ABIGAIL.

10:54.920 --> 10:57.241
SHE'S BEEN TRYING
TO REACH ME ALL DAY.

10:57.290 --> 10:58.882
WE'RE ENTERING A PHASE
IN OUR RELATIONSHIP

10:58.920 --> 11:00.456
THAT I SIMPLY CAN'T
GET A HANDLE ON.

11:00.490 --> 11:03.152
I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR
YOUR THOUGHTS.

11:03.190 --> 11:04.179
THOUGH I WOULDN'T PRESUME
TO KNOW

11:04.230 --> 11:05.322
WHAT KIND OF STUFF
YOU'RE INTO.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.726
PROBABLY DON'T ASK,
DON'T TELL.

11:07.760 --> 11:10.797
I'M JUST GONNA LET IT GO
TO VOICE MAIL.

11:10.830 --> 11:14.095
- INDEED.
PACK UP HIS THINGS.

11:14.140 --> 11:15.994
- UH, WE WILL NEED TO LOOK
THROUGH ALL OF HIS BELONGINGS

11:16.040 --> 11:17.905
BEFORE THEY GO ANYWHERE.

11:17.940 --> 11:20.272
- AND WE'RE GOING TO NEED
TO RETRACE HIS STEPS

11:20.310 --> 11:21.572
LEADING TO HIS DEATH.

11:21.610 --> 11:26.070
WE'D LIKE TO START
WITH HIS WORK ASSIGNMENTS.

11:26.110 --> 11:28.340
- VERY WELL.
LIEUTENANT WALLACH,

11:28.380 --> 11:30.917
ESCORT THESE CIVILIANS DOWN
TO PRIVATE STARKS' BARRACKS,

11:30.950 --> 11:32.486
AND THEN TO THE MOTOR POOL,
WHERE HE WORKED.

11:32.520 --> 11:34.579
- OOH, MOTOR POOL! THAT'S US.
WE'LL TAKE THE MOTOR POOL.

11:34.620 --> 11:36.258
[whispers]
DUDE, BE ALL YOU CAN BE.
- WHAT?

11:36.290 --> 11:38.121
WE'LL NEED
ONE OF THOSE HUMMERS.

11:38.160 --> 11:39.957
THE OPEN HUMMERS THAT WE SAW
ON THE WAY IN.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.560
AND MY PARTNER WILL REQUIRE
A CORNCOB PIPE.

11:44.630 --> 11:46.564
- AFTERNOON, SOLDIER.
EWAN O'HARA.

11:46.600 --> 11:49.489
THIS IS SHAWN SPENCER.
HE'S A PSYCHIC DETECTIVE

11:49.540 --> 11:51.167
HELPING THE SANTA BARBARA
POLICE DEPARTMENT.

11:51.210 --> 11:53.201
INVESTIGATING THE SUICIDE
OF PRIVATE DAVID STARKS.

11:53.240 --> 11:54.332
- WE HEARD.
IT WAS A SHAME.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.371
- [grunts]

11:56.410 --> 11:59.299
- OH, THIS IS HIS PARTNER
GHEE BUTTERSNAPS.

11:59.350 --> 12:00.977
THAT'S NOT YOUR REAL NAME.

12:01.020 --> 12:02.988
- OH, MY GOSH, JULIET DIDN'T
EVEN TELL YOU MY NAME?

12:03.020 --> 12:05.181
- GUS, PLEASE, LET'S FOCUS.

12:05.220 --> 12:06.812
YOUR PETTINESS IONS
ARE INTERFERING

12:06.860 --> 12:08.509
WITH MY PSYCHIC IONS,

12:08.560 --> 12:10.824
CREATING RECEPTO NON GRATA
INTERFERO BUPKIS.

12:10.860 --> 12:12.157
- WHAT ARE YOU EVEN
TALKING ABOUT?

12:12.190 --> 12:13.452
- SHAWN, THIS STUFF IS
SO COOL.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.491
HOW DOES THIS PSYCHIC
INVESTIGATION THING WORK?

12:15.530 --> 12:17.760
- EWAN...

12:17.800 --> 12:20.860
WOULD YOU ASK THE EGYPTIANS
HOW THEY BUILT THE PYRAMIDS?

12:20.900 --> 12:23.698
WOULD YOU ASK YO-YO MA
HOW HE MAKES MUSIC

12:23.740 --> 12:25.958
SOUND LIKE HEAVEN?

12:26.010 --> 12:30.071
WOULD YOU ASK IRON MIKE SHARPE
WHY HE FELT THE NEED TO SHOWER

12:30.110 --> 12:31.577
FOR MORE THAN 90 MINUTES

12:31.610 --> 12:33.646
AFTER WRESTLING
FOR LESS THAN TEN?

12:33.680 --> 12:37.218
MY POINT IS,
IT'S NOT A SCIENCE.

12:37.250 --> 12:40.617
FOR EXAMPLE,
WHAT IS THIS THING?

12:40.660 --> 12:42.389
- IT'S CALLED AN ARMORED
PERSONNEL CARRIER.

12:42.420 --> 12:43.648
- OF COURSE IT IS, GUS.

12:43.690 --> 12:46.818
I MEANT IN AT MORE
PHILOSOPHICAL LEVEL.

12:46.860 --> 12:49.522
WHAT...IS IT?

12:58.340 --> 13:01.901
I AM SENSING THAT PRIVATE STARKS
WAS INSUBORDINATE AND LAZY.

13:01.940 --> 13:03.441
A REAL SLUFF-OFF.

13:03.480 --> 13:05.846
- NO. THE OPPOSITE.
HE WAS A MODEL PRIVATE.

13:05.880 --> 13:08.348
ONE OF THE MOST CONSCIENTIOUS
SOLDIERS IN THE SQUAD, IN FACT.

13:08.380 --> 13:10.712
- PLEASE, SOLDIER,
DON'T INTERRUPT ME.

13:10.750 --> 13:12.411
NEVER DO THAT.

13:12.450 --> 13:13.883
THAT WAS THE NEXT THING
I WAS GOING TO SAY.

13:13.920 --> 13:15.649
MODEL SOLDIER.

13:15.690 --> 13:18.989
EXEMPLARY.
PRISTIN E.

13:19.030 --> 13:21.498
BUT I AM SENSING THAT HE
SIGNED OUT OF WORK LAST MONDAY,

13:21.530 --> 13:24.727
AND INSTEAD WENT TO...
DINNER.

13:24.770 --> 13:25.919
- YOU MUST BE GETTING "DNR,"

13:25.970 --> 13:29.565
WHICH STANDS FOR
"DID NOT REPORT."

13:29.600 --> 13:30.601
- ANY REASON WHY
THAT WOULD HAPPEN?

13:30.640 --> 13:32.198
- WELL, THE ONLY
OFFICIAL REASON

13:32.240 --> 13:33.776
A SOLDIER CAN LEGALLY
SIGN OUT FOR WORK DUTY

13:33.810 --> 13:35.129
IS DUE TO A SICKNESS
OR AN INJURY,

13:35.180 --> 13:36.807
OR FOR A MEETING
WITH A SUPERIOR.

13:36.850 --> 13:39.307
- HELLO?
EXCUSE ME, GUYS.

13:41.680 --> 13:43.545
THIS IS ALPHA FOUR, GO.

13:43.590 --> 13:46.855
- ALPHA FOUR, WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

13:46.890 --> 13:48.118
- LAST TIME I CHECKED,
I WAS ON VACATION.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.458
- YES, BUT WHAT, EXACTLY,
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING

13:50.490 --> 13:51.650
ON THAT BASE?

13:51.690 --> 13:53.396
- WAIT, HOW DID YOU--
- COME ON, FOUR.

13:53.430 --> 13:55.352
YOU START FLASHING
THAT CLEARANCE BADGE AROUND

13:55.400 --> 13:56.424
AND ALARMS GO OFF.

13:56.460 --> 13:57.996
- OKAY, I'M HELPING MY SISTER

13:58.030 --> 13:59.361
AND THE SANTA BARBARA
POLICE DEPARTMENT

13:59.400 --> 14:01.391
WITH AN INVESTIGATION,
AND I DON'T SEE HOW ANY OF THAT

14:01.440 --> 14:03.169
IS YOUR BUSINESS.

14:03.210 --> 14:04.905
- EVERYTHING YOU DO
IS MY BUSINESS,

14:04.940 --> 14:06.339
AND EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS
ON THAT BASE

14:06.370 --> 14:07.769
IS THE ARMY'S BUSINESS.

14:07.810 --> 14:09.334
YOUR INSTRUCTIONS,
ALPHA FOUR,

14:09.380 --> 14:11.439
ARE TO GO TO WHATEVER LENGTHS
TO KEEP IT THAT WAY.

14:13.650 --> 14:16.369
- HEY! DON'T TOUCH THAT!

14:16.420 --> 14:19.446
- YOU JUST GOT YOURSELF
AN ASSIGNMENT.

14:19.490 --> 14:20.684
IF THERE IS A BAD SEED
ON THAT BASE,

14:20.720 --> 14:22.551
I WANT YOU TO BE THE ONE
TO UNCOVER THEM.

14:22.590 --> 14:26.526
YOUR ORDERS:
DO WHAT IT IS YOU DO

14:26.560 --> 14:28.118
TO MAKE SURE IT NEVER SEES
THE LIGHT OF DAY.

14:28.160 --> 14:30.367
- YES, SIR.

14:30.400 --> 14:31.321
- SIR...

14:31.370 --> 14:33.167
THE FILE YOUR TEAM
ASKED FOR.

14:33.200 --> 14:36.135
- THANK YOU, SOLDIER.

14:48.480 --> 14:51.313
[shredder humming]

14:59.360 --> 15:01.828
[cell phone rings]
- IT'S ABIGAIL. AGAIN.

15:01.860 --> 15:03.168
- YOU'RE ACTING LIKE IT'S ODD
FOR YOUR GIRLFRIEND

15:03.200 --> 15:04.519
TO BE CALLING YOU
ON THE PHONE.

15:04.570 --> 15:05.867
- NO, THE PHONE IS A DEVICE
THAT'S BEEN AROUND

15:05.900 --> 15:07.094
FOR DOZENS OF YEARS.

15:07.140 --> 15:08.539
THAT'S NOT THE_ODD PART.
[cell phone ringing]

15:08.570 --> 15:10.936
SHE'S JUST BEING AWFULLY
CLINGY LATELY, YOU KNOW?

15:10.970 --> 15:12.528
LIKE I'M--
I'M NEVER DOING ENOUGH.

15:12.570 --> 15:13.639
- OH, I DON'T KNOW.

15:13.680 --> 15:14.772
I THINK TAKING HER
TO THE DEAD GUY SHOW

15:14.810 --> 15:15.936
WAS PRETTY GOOD.

15:15.980 --> 15:17.277
[cell phone continues ringing]

15:17.310 --> 15:18.572
- YOU'RE RIGHT, I'M AN IDIOT.

15:18.610 --> 15:21.818
HEY, ABS.
BEFORE YOU EVEN SAY ANYTHING,

15:21.850 --> 15:23.613
I JUST WANT TO APOLOGIZE
FOR THE WHOLE DOG TAGS

15:23.650 --> 15:25.242
IN THE ESOPHAGUS FIASCO.

15:25.290 --> 15:26.917
BUT I WILL BE
MAKING IT UP TO YOU

15:26.960 --> 15:29.383
TONIGHT...8:00 P.M.

15:29.420 --> 15:31.058
PERFECT.

15:31.090 --> 15:32.421
- ALL RIGHT, SO GOING THROUGH
STARKS'S PERSONAL EFFECTS

15:32.460 --> 15:35.452
BEFORE THEY WERE SENT OFF
DIDN'T RAISE ANY FLAGS.

15:35.500 --> 15:38.663
OH, WELL, GOOD AFTERNOON.
NICE OF YOU TO JOIN US.

15:38.700 --> 15:40.167
A LOT HAS HAPPENED.

15:40.200 --> 15:42.088
MAYBE YOU'D LIKE TO TRY
AND CATCH UP.

15:42.140 --> 15:44.233
- LASSITER, IT IS PRECISELY
8:20 IN THE A.M.

15:44.270 --> 15:46.067
WHAT COULD POSSIBLY
HAVE HAPPENED?

15:46.110 --> 15:47.907
- WHAT, DID YOU JUST RUN
A MARATHON?

15:47.940 --> 15:50.147
[laughter]
- YES.

15:51.410 --> 15:53.514
- WHILE I MAY HAVE BEEN
SLEEPING LATE,

15:53.550 --> 15:54.812
I HAD VERY, VERY
PRODUCT IVE DREAMS.

15:54.850 --> 15:56.272
I NOW KNOW TWO NEW THINGS.

15:56.320 --> 15:58.880
ONE, THE HOWLER MONKEY
THAT WEARS THE OVERALLS

15:58.920 --> 16:00.808
AND PLAYS THE GLOCKENSPIEL
IS MY INNER CHILD

16:00.860 --> 16:03.624
PLEADING WITH ME TO CLING
TO MY INNOCENCE.

16:03.660 --> 16:05.628
AND TWO,
THE FACT THAT STARKS

16:05.660 --> 16:08.356
SIGNED OUT OF WORK ON MONDAY
MEANS SOMETHING.

16:08.400 --> 16:11.096
- SHAWN,
I ADMIRE YOUR FORTITUDE...

16:11.130 --> 16:13.269
MAYBE IT'S 'CAUSE I'VE BEEN
ON THE INSIDE SO LONG,

16:13.300 --> 16:14.665
BUT THIS THING SMELLS
OF SUICIDE.

16:14.700 --> 16:16.361
- CAN YOU GET US BACK
ONTO THE BASE?

16:16.400 --> 16:17.628
- I DON'T KNOW.

16:17.670 --> 16:18.898
IT'S NOT LIKE THE ANNUAL PASS
TO DISNEYLAND.

16:18.940 --> 16:21.238
THAT WAS A VERY SPECIAL
CIRCUMSTANCE.

16:21.280 --> 16:23.840
- EWAN, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO THAT.

16:23.880 --> 16:25.074
YOU'VE DONE ENOUGH ALREADY.

16:25.110 --> 16:26.475
AND THANK YOU FOR GETTING US
STARKS' FILE.

16:26.510 --> 16:28.569
I KNOW YOU PULLED SOME STRINGS
TO DO THAT.

16:28.620 --> 16:30.713
- I KNOW. I MEAN, I WISH I
COULD HAVE TURNED SOMETHING UP

16:30.750 --> 16:32.479
FOR YOU GUYS--
IT'S A TOUGH BREAK.

16:32.520 --> 16:35.910
EXCUSE US...MEN.

16:41.330 --> 16:42.319
[whispering]
DUDE, SOMEBODY TAMPERED

16:42.360 --> 16:43.566
WITH THAT FILE.

16:43.600 --> 16:44.567
NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN
CAPTAIN AMERICA

16:44.600 --> 16:45.589
ISN'T INTERESTED IN HELPING.

16:45.630 --> 16:47.268
WE NEED TO GET BACK
ON THAT BASE...

16:47.300 --> 16:48.699
UNSUPERVISED.

16:48.740 --> 16:50.059
- AND HOW ARE WE GONNA
DO THAT, SHAWN?

16:50.110 --> 16:52.101
JUST GO THE BASE AND BEG
TO GET BACK ON AGAIN?

16:52.140 --> 16:54.677
"EXCUSE ME, OFFICER, CAN WE
GET BACK ON THE BASE, PLEASE?"

16:54.710 --> 16:58.441
- COME ON, SOLIDER,
WE'RE GONNA SNEAK ON.

16:58.480 --> 17:00.448
UNDER THE RADAR.

17:00.480 --> 17:02.846
- UNDER THE RADAR?

17:02.880 --> 17:04.711
- [very quietly]
UNDER THE RADAR.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.620
- COME ON, DUDE,
HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW

17:16.660 --> 17:18.594
THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAD
REAL RADAR?

17:18.630 --> 17:21.963
LOOK AT THE BRIGHT SIDE, MAN.
WE'RE IN A HUMVEE!

17:22.000 --> 17:23.308
- JUST WHAT IN THE HELL
DID YOU THINK YOU WERE

17:23.340 --> 17:25.399
GONNA GET AWAY WITH?

17:25.440 --> 17:27.738
I ASSUME YOU REALIZE
THAT THIS KIND OF IDIOCY

17:27.780 --> 17:29.634
WILL NOT BE TOLERATED
ON MY BASE!

17:29.680 --> 17:30.977
- IS THERE ANOTHER TYPE
OF IDIOCY

17:31.010 --> 17:32.705
THAT YOU WOULD BE
MORE COMFORTABLE WITH?

17:34.950 --> 17:36.542
UNDERSTOOD.

17:36.580 --> 17:39.048
I HOPE THIS DOESN'T AFFECT GUS
AND I'S CHANCES OF ENLISTING.

17:39.090 --> 17:40.978
- SON, I'M NOT SURE
WHAT MAKES EITHER OF YOU THINK

17:41.020 --> 17:42.112
YOU'RE ARMY MATERIAL.

17:42.160 --> 17:46.722
- I HAVE TWO WORDS FOR YOU:
ARMY...

17:46.760 --> 17:48.398
PSYCHIC.

17:48.430 --> 17:50.421
I'M GIVING YOU FIRST SHOT
BEFORE I PITCH IT TO CBS

17:50.470 --> 17:52.062
AS A TELEVISION IDEA.

17:52.100 --> 17:54.989
- WE APOLOGIZE, SIR.
AND IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

17:55.040 --> 17:56.792
- THAT'S MORE LIKE IT.

17:56.840 --> 17:58.239
- AND FOR THE RECORD,
I HAVE THE UTMOST RESPECT

17:58.270 --> 17:59.464
FOR THE UNITED STATES ARMY,

17:59.510 --> 18:01.273
AND ALL BRANCHES OF THE
MILITARY, FOR THAT MATTER.

18:01.310 --> 18:02.675
- EXCEPT, OF COURSE,
THE COAST GUARD.

18:02.710 --> 18:04.507
DID YOU SEE THE GUARDIAN?

18:04.550 --> 18:07.610
- I'LL BE CONTACTING YOUR
SUPERIORS ABOUT THIS INCIDENT.

18:07.650 --> 18:11.484
THERE WILL BE CONSEQUENCES.

18:11.520 --> 18:13.158
- CONSEQUENCES?

18:13.190 --> 18:15.454
- CONSEQUENCES!

18:15.490 --> 18:16.889
- SHAWN, HE'S GONNA COME BACK
WITH A BAR OF SOAP

18:16.920 --> 18:17.989
WRAPPED IN A TOWEL!

18:18.030 --> 18:19.349
- WOULD YOU RELAX?

18:19.390 --> 18:22.223
THERE'S NO WAY
WE'RE GETTING D'ONOFRIOED.

18:33.310 --> 18:35.505
- YOU TELL HIM.
IT WAS YOUR PSYCHIC REVELATION.

18:35.540 --> 18:36.677
- I'M ASKING Yﬁg AS A FAVOR.

18:36.710 --> 18:37.677
- AS A FRIEND.
- NO.

18:37.710 --> 18:38.745
- ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS.
- NO.

18:38.780 --> 18:39.747
- TWO OUT OF THREE.
- NO.

18:39.780 --> 18:41.008
- JUST TELL HIM.
- NO.

18:41.050 --> 18:42.711
- SOMEONE BETTER START
TELLING ME SOMETHING,

18:42.750 --> 18:45.548
BECAUSE I'M IN THE MOOD
TO STAPLE HEADS.

18:46.920 --> 18:48.478
- ALL RIGHT,
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

18:48.520 --> 18:49.657
WHERE EWAN WAS LAST NIGHT?

18:49.690 --> 18:51.681
- WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO
WITH ANYTHING?

18:51.730 --> 18:54.119
- YOU AND I BOTH KNOW THAT EVEN
JULIET HERSELF CAN'T TELL US

18:54.160 --> 18:56.299
EXACTLY WHAT EWAN DOES FOR THE
U.S. GOVERNMENT AT THIS POINT.

18:56.330 --> 18:58.093
AND HIS PAST
IS SOME BIG SECRET.

18:58.130 --> 19:00.189
- HE JUST BREEZES IN AND
BREEZES OUT OF THE ARMY BASE,

19:00.240 --> 19:02.435
AND NOW, ALL OF A SUDDEN,
HE'S RELUCTANT TO GET US ON?

19:02.470 --> 19:03.630
- IN ALL FAIRNESS,
HE BARELY KNOWS YOU.

19:03.670 --> 19:05.433
WHEN WE WERE POWS,

19:05.470 --> 19:06.937
WE SAW EWAN OUTSIDE
FELTS' OFFICE.

19:06.970 --> 19:08.437
NOW, WHAT
WAS HE DOING THERE?

19:08.480 --> 19:10.345
- FOR PETE'S SAKE, SPENCER,
IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY,

19:10.380 --> 19:12.871
THEN SPIT IT OUT--
WHAT IS ON YOUR MIND?

19:12.910 --> 19:15.014
- [clears throat]
ALL RIGHT, RIGHT NOW IT'S--

19:15.050 --> 19:16.278
IT'S JUST A MAJOR HUNCH.

19:16.320 --> 19:20.450
BUT I THINK EWAN IS
DEEPLY INVOLVED IN ALL OF THIS.

19:20.490 --> 19:23.254
- YOU THINK O'HARA'S BROTHER'S
A MURDERER?

19:23.290 --> 19:24.587
both: SHH!

19:27.060 --> 19:28.197
- MAYBE.

19:44.050 --> 19:47.542
- HOW DARE YOU ACCUSE
MY BROTHER OF MURDER.

19:47.580 --> 19:50.140
- JULES, I'M NOT ACCUSING.

19:50.180 --> 19:52.410
AT THIS POINT IT'S JUST
A STRONG PSYCHIC HUNCH.

19:52.450 --> 19:54.611
- JUST FOR THE RECORD,
YOU TWO CHARGED

19:54.660 --> 19:56.651
BOTH OF MY PARENTS
WITH MURDER ON CHRISTMAS.

19:56.690 --> 19:58.783
- THAT'S VERY TRUE.

19:58.830 --> 20:01.924
JUST ASK YOURSELF,
WHAT IS HE DOING HERE?

20:01.960 --> 20:03.427
WHY IS HE IN SANTA BARBARA?

20:03.470 --> 20:06.928
- THAT'S IT? THAT'S YOUR
THEORY, THAT HE'S IN TOWN?

20:06.970 --> 20:08.699
WELL, TRY THIS THEORY ON
FOR SIZE.

20:08.740 --> 20:10.298
YOU ALWAYS ARGUE
WITH YOUR FATHER,

20:10.340 --> 20:12.035
AND YOU RARELY EVEN SEE
YOUR MOTHER.

20:12.070 --> 20:13.970
MAYBE--MAYBE IT'S JUST HARD
FOR YOU TO WRAP YOUR HEAD

20:14.010 --> 20:16.308
AROUND THE FACT THAT
SOMEBODY MIGHT HAVE A HEALTHY,

20:16.340 --> 20:17.807
LOVING RELATIONSHIP
WITH THEIR FAMILY.

20:17.850 --> 20:19.647
WHAT, OTHER THAN BEING
A WAR HERO,

20:19.680 --> 20:22.114
HAS MY BROTHER DONE
TO BRING ON YOUR SUSPICIONS?

20:22.150 --> 20:24.618
- HE HAS AN ARSENAL OF WEAPONS
IN HIS PANTS.

20:24.650 --> 20:27.619
- SHAWN, YOU KNOW,
YOU MIGHT JUST TRY TO MASK

20:27.660 --> 20:29.616
YOUR OBVIOUS JEALOUSY
FOR EWAN.

20:29.660 --> 20:33.118
- JEALO--
JEALOUSY OF EW--WHAT?

20:33.160 --> 20:35.196
THAT'S FUNNY.
THAT'S--

20:35.230 --> 20:36.891
THAT'S--HOW FUNNY IS THAT, GUS?
- IT'S PRETTY FUNNY.

20:36.930 --> 20:39.421
- WELL, LET'S LAUGH A LITTLE.
[laughter]

20:39.470 --> 20:41.563
BECAUSE--BECAUSE EWAN AND I ARE
BASICALLY THE SAME PERSON.

20:41.600 --> 20:42.931
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

20:42.970 --> 20:45.268
- YOU KNOW, SPENCER, MAYBE YOUR
TIME WOULD BE BETTER SERVED

20:45.310 --> 20:46.538
IF YOU WERE
TO CONCENTRATE ON REAL,

20:46.570 --> 20:48.037
VIABLE SUSPECT S
IN OUR MIDST.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.638
LIKE FELTS, FOR EXAMPLE.

20:49.680 --> 20:51.102
ALL RIGHT, THIS GUY THINKS
HE'S KING OF THE WORLD

20:51.150 --> 20:52.503
BECAUSE HE'S GOT A COUPLE STARS
ON HIS CHEST.

20:52.550 --> 20:54.347
WELL, I'VE GOT A BADGE,
AND THAT GUY'S GOING DOWN.

20:54.380 --> 20:56.018
- WELL, HELLO THERE,
DETECTIVE.

20:56.050 --> 20:58.917
PLEASE TELL ME
I'M NOT GOING DOWN

20:58.950 --> 21:01.214
BEFORE I'VE HAD
MY MORNING COFFEE.

21:01.260 --> 21:04.525
- MAJOR GENERAL,
THANK YOU FOR COMING DOWN.

21:04.560 --> 21:07.222
TO BE HONEST, WE WERE JUST
EXPECTING A PHONE CALL.

21:07.260 --> 21:08.454
- WELL, YOUNG LADY,

21:08.500 --> 21:09.990
WE DIDN'T HAVE PHONES
IN NHA TRANG

21:10.030 --> 21:15.093
WHEN I TOOK DOWN NINE MEN
WITH MY BARE HANDS.

21:15.140 --> 21:17.734
PERHAPS WE COULD TALK
IN PRIVATE?

21:17.770 --> 21:19.829
- IN HERE.

21:19.870 --> 21:22.873
- GO HOME.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.246
MAJOR GENERAL,
YOU CARE TO SIT DOWN?

21:33.290 --> 21:35.383
- DID YOU KNOW OF THE 39 MEN
WHO SIGNED

21:35.420 --> 21:37.320
OUR DECLARATION
OF INDEPENDENCE,

21:37.360 --> 21:39.089
32 OF 'EM WERE STANDING
WHEN THEY DID IT.

21:39.130 --> 21:42.156
THIS COUNTRY WAS BUILT
FROM A STANDING POSITION.

21:42.200 --> 21:43.827
I'M GOOD.

21:45.230 --> 21:47.198
- THANK YOU FOR
THE HISTORY LESSON.

21:47.230 --> 21:48.561
NOW TO MATTERS
OF THIS CENTURY.

21:48.600 --> 21:51.160
THIS MURDER ISN'T GOING AWAY,
AND NEITHER ARE WE.

21:51.210 --> 21:52.529
WE WANT SOME ANSWERS.

21:52.570 --> 21:54.936
- I CAME DOWN HERE
AS A COURTESY TO YOU.

21:54.980 --> 21:56.538
BUT IF YOU'RE GONNA
TURN THIS INTO

21:56.580 --> 21:58.309
AN INTERROGATION, DETECTIVE,

21:58.350 --> 22:00.409
YOU'D BETTER BE PREPARED
TO STICK BAMBOO SHOOTS

22:00.450 --> 22:02.873
UNDER MY FINGERNAILS.

22:04.650 --> 22:07.039
I DIDN'T THINK SO.

22:11.190 --> 22:14.853
- I WILL BE BACK AT THAT BASE
WITH WARRANTS!

22:14.900 --> 22:16.197
A STACK OF 'EM!

22:18.730 --> 22:20.698
- OH, I'M SORRY,
DID YOU FORGET HOW TO GET HOME?

22:20.740 --> 22:22.264
'CAUSE WE CAN HAVE AN OFFICER
TAKE YOU.

22:22.300 --> 22:25.531
- JULES, JULES...

22:25.570 --> 22:28.175
WE BOTH KNOW HOW WE CAN
GET BACK ON THAT BASE.

22:28.210 --> 22:30.872
- I'M SORRY, YOU'VE
ACCUSED MY BROTHER OF MURDER,

22:30.910 --> 22:32.275
AND NOW YOU WANT TO USE HIM?

22:32.310 --> 22:34.175
- WE BOTH HAVE A STAKE
IN THIS INVESTIGATION,

22:34.220 --> 22:35.244
SO LET'S INVESTIGATE.

22:35.280 --> 22:37.544
THAT IS OUR JOBS, REMEMBER?

22:37.590 --> 22:38.989
THIS BROTHER THING IS
JUST A HUNCH.

22:39.020 --> 22:41.056
BUT I AM A PSYCHIC, WHICH MEANS
I NEED TO BE NEAR HIM

22:41.090 --> 22:42.387
IN ORDER TO READ HIM.

22:42.420 --> 22:44.854
NOW, WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF?

22:44.890 --> 22:47.085
THAT I CAN PROVE I'M RIGHT?

22:47.130 --> 22:49.348
- NO.

22:49.400 --> 22:52.494
THAT'S JUST HOW YOU'LL PROVE
THAT YOU'RE WRONG.

22:57.300 --> 22:59.131
- EWE...

22:59.170 --> 23:00.728
HOW MANY MEN WOULD YOU SAY
YOU'VE KILLED?

23:00.780 --> 23:02.270
- SHAWN!
- OF THE FOUR OF US,

23:02.310 --> 23:04.301
YOUR BROTHER'S THE ONLY ONE
WHO'S PROBABLY KILLED A MAN,

23:04.350 --> 23:05.669
UNLESS WE'RE COUNTING
ACCIDENTAL DEATHS,

23:05.710 --> 23:06.802
IN WHICH CASE GUS WOULD BE
IN THE RUNNING.

23:06.850 --> 23:07.874
- SHAWN--

23:07.920 --> 23:08.944
- YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DEFEND YOURSELF.

23:08.980 --> 23:13.986
I'M SIMPLY WONDERING...
HOW IT FEELS.

23:14.020 --> 23:16.716
- I HOPE YOU NEVER HAVE
TO FIND OUT.

23:19.160 --> 23:21.526
- SSSNAP.

23:24.170 --> 23:26.388
- I ASKED FOR THAT.
- YES, YOU DID.

23:29.000 --> 23:33.437
- SIR, I'M GONNA HAVE TO ASK
YOU NOT TO TOUCH THE WEAPONS.

23:33.480 --> 23:34.777
- WHAT IS THIS?

23:34.810 --> 23:36.437
- THAT IS AN ANTI-TANK WEAPON.

23:36.480 --> 23:39.745
AND YOU'RE POINTING IT
AT YOURSELF.

23:39.780 --> 23:42.908
- YOU USED TO WORK WITH STARKS
IN THE MOTORCADE, DID YOU NOT?

23:42.950 --> 23:46.078
- YES, I DID.
BUT YOU KNOW THAT.

23:46.120 --> 23:47.712
- HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

23:47.760 --> 23:49.011
- THERE'S ONLY A CERTAIN AMOUNT
OF JOBS

23:49.060 --> 23:51.187
A PRIVATE CAN BE ASSIGNED TO
ON A BASE LIKE THIS.

23:51.230 --> 23:52.686
DEDUCTIVE REASONING.

23:59.630 --> 24:01.564
- CLIPBOARD, PLEASE.

24:01.600 --> 24:06.230
- SIR?
- CLIPBOARD, PLEASE, SIR.

24:06.270 --> 24:09.376
WOW.
STARKS TOUCHED THIS CLIPBOARD.

24:09.410 --> 24:11.048
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN.

24:11.080 --> 24:12.809
- I THINK YOU DO, SOLDIER.

24:12.850 --> 24:16.741
I THINK YOU DO.

24:16.780 --> 24:21.456
- IF YOU HAVE INFORMATION,
YOU BETTER TELL US.

24:21.490 --> 24:25.483
- ONE OF THE PRIVATES
MAY HAVE HAD A GIRLFRIEND.

24:25.530 --> 24:27.350
AND HE MAY HAVE
SNUCK OFF THE BASE THAT NIGHT

24:27.390 --> 24:28.459
TO SEE HER.

24:28.500 --> 24:30.320
- AND HE MAY HAVE HAD
HIS PAL STARKS

24:30.360 --> 24:32.624
SUB IN FOR HIM
AND MAN HIS SHIFT.

24:32.670 --> 24:35.195
- STARKS NORMALLY WORKS
THE MOTOR POOL,

24:35.240 --> 24:37.708
SO HE KNEW NOTHING
ABOUT WEAPON INVENTORY.

24:37.740 --> 24:38.764
ISN'T THAT RISKY?

24:38.810 --> 24:40.573
- IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE.

24:40.610 --> 24:43.477
MACHINE SUPPLIES COME IN,
TRUCKS PICK 'EM UP. SIMPLE.

24:43.510 --> 24:44.875
- STARKS SAW SOMETHING
THAT NIGHT

24:44.910 --> 24:46.878
THAT HE WASN'T SUPPOSED TO.

24:46.910 --> 24:47.979
THE QUESTION IS...

24:48.020 --> 24:52.241
WHAT WAS IT?
[cell phone vibrates]

24:52.290 --> 24:53.382
- HELLO?

24:53.420 --> 24:55.752
- WHAT IS THE STATUS, FOUR?

24:55.790 --> 24:57.655
- IT'S A LITTLE EARLY
FOR A COCKTAIL, ISN'T IT?

24:57.690 --> 24:59.055
- NOT ON THIS COAST.

24:59.090 --> 25:02.059
NOW TELL ME YOU'VE
WRAPPED THIS THING UP.

25:02.100 --> 25:04.091
- I'VE TRIED EVERYTHING
TO SLOW IT DOWN.

25:04.130 --> 25:07.964
I'VE TURNED 'EM THE WRONG WAY.
I'VE SHREDDED EVIDENCE.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.537
THIS SHAWN SPENCER CHARACTER
IS VERY GOOD AT WHAT HE DOES.

25:10.570 --> 25:12.731
STARKS WAS ONTO SOMETHING,
AND SPENCER'S CLOSE.

25:12.770 --> 25:14.909
- ARE YOU TELLING ME
YOU CAN'T HANDLE

25:14.940 --> 25:16.032
SOME LOCAL PSYCHIC?

25:16.080 --> 25:17.229
- NO.

25:17.280 --> 25:18.406
I'M GONNA FOLLOW HIS LEAD
TO THE TARGET,

25:18.450 --> 25:19.678
THEN I'LL DEAL WITH IT.
IT'S PERFECT.

25:19.710 --> 25:22.042
- OKAY, FOUR.
BUT BE IN TOUCH.

25:22.080 --> 25:25.345
AND IN CASE YOU WEREN'T SURE,
THAT'S AN ORDER.

25:27.390 --> 25:29.051
- EWAN...

25:29.090 --> 25:30.079
YOU THINK YOU COULD GET
GUS AND I

25:30.120 --> 25:32.588
BACK ON THE BASE
LATE NIGHT?

25:32.630 --> 25:33.927
- NOT A PROBLEM.

25:40.670 --> 25:42.297
- THIS IS NICE.

25:42.340 --> 25:44.205
- YEAH, IT IS.

25:44.240 --> 25:48.006
JUST YOU AND ME.
ME AND YOU.

25:48.040 --> 25:51.441
I'M TALKING ABOUT US, MAN.
I'M TALKING ABOUT THIS...

25:51.480 --> 25:54.677
BEING IN A RELATIONSHIP,
SPENDING THE TIME,

25:54.720 --> 25:56.676
SPOONING IT UP, IT'S...

26:07.530 --> 26:09.122
- I'M SORRY, DO YOU, UH,
HAVE SOMEWHERE TO BE?

26:09.160 --> 26:12.323
- NO, NO. NO.
_ N--

26:12.370 --> 26:14.895
- THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
I WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

26:14.940 --> 26:16.066
WHY WOULD I...

26:19.740 --> 26:21.276
I'M SORRY.

26:21.310 --> 26:24.848
I HAD EVERY INTENTION
OF MAKING THIS AN AMAZING DATE.

26:24.880 --> 26:27.144
OKAY? I DID.
I JUST--I HAVE TO WORK.

26:27.180 --> 26:30.308
MAYBE IF I HAD A NORMAL JOB
WITH REGULAR HOURS,

26:30.350 --> 26:31.510
LIKE YOU DO--

26:31.550 --> 26:32.915
- SHAWN, I THINK
YOU'RE MISSING THE POINT.

26:32.950 --> 26:34.417
- I'M NOT TOTALLY AVAILABLE
TO YOU.

26:34.460 --> 26:36.109
- SHAWN, LISTEN TO ME--

26:36.160 --> 26:37.684
- THERE ARE THINGS
THAT I HAVE TO DO, ABIGAIL,

26:37.730 --> 26:38.981
BECAUSE I HAVE TO DO THEM,

26:39.030 --> 26:40.657
AND THEY DON'T INVOLVE
OUR RELATIONSHIP.

26:40.700 --> 26:42.759
- I'M GOING TO UGANDA!

26:42.800 --> 26:45.098
- THE CITY?

26:45.130 --> 26:46.791
- IT'S A COUNTRY, SHAWN.

26:46.830 --> 26:49.037
- I KNEW THAT.

26:50.440 --> 26:53.159
TELL ME YOU'RE NOT HAVING
AN AFFAIR WITH KAMALA.

26:53.210 --> 26:54.575
- KAMALA THE WRESTLER?

26:54.610 --> 26:57.170
WELL, HIS REAL NAME IS
JIM HARRIS,

26:57.210 --> 27:00.441
AND HE'S NOT FROM UGANDA,
HE'S FROM MISSISSIPPI.

27:00.480 --> 27:04.246
- GOD, I LOVE
THAT YOU KNOW THAT.

27:04.290 --> 27:07.145
ALL RIGHT. OKAY.

27:07.190 --> 27:09.215
UH, WHEN DO YOU LEAVE?

27:09.260 --> 27:10.750
- TWO DAYS.

27:10.790 --> 27:13.350
- WOW. HOW LONG?

27:13.390 --> 27:15.221
- SIX MONTHS.
- WHAT?

27:15.260 --> 27:16.898
- MAYBE LONGER.
- WHAT?

27:16.930 --> 27:18.295
- I'M SORRY I DIDN'T
TELL YOU SOONER.

27:18.330 --> 27:19.592
IT ALL JUST HAPPENED
REALLY FAST.

27:19.630 --> 27:22.167
LISTEN, IT'S THIS
AMAZING PROGRAM, ALL RIGHT?

27:22.200 --> 27:23.565
IT'S CALLED
"ONE KID ONE WORLD."

27:23.600 --> 27:25.966
I'M GONNA BE HELPING TO BUILD
AND DESIGN THIS SCHOOL,

27:26.010 --> 27:28.478
AND I'M GONNA TEACH KIDS WHO
ARE JUST DESPERATE TO LEARN.

27:30.180 --> 27:31.579
- THAT'S WHY I'VE BEEN
PRESSURING YOU TO GET TOGETHER,

27:31.610 --> 27:32.838
SO I COULD TELL YOU.

27:32.880 --> 27:34.040
- REALLY, ABS?

27:34.080 --> 27:35.172
YOU COULDN'T HAVE
SLIPPED IT IN ANYWHERE

27:35.220 --> 27:36.312
BEFORE RIGHT NOW,
THIS SECOND?

27:36.350 --> 27:37.419
- I THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

27:37.450 --> 27:39.247
I THOUGHT ABOUT IT
RIGHT AFTER THE CORONER

27:39.290 --> 27:41.110
PULLED THE DOG TAGS OUT
OF THAT GUY'S MOUTH.

27:41.160 --> 27:42.479
- COME ON.

27:42.520 --> 27:43.612
- LET'S JUST HAVE
THE CONVERSATION

27:43.660 --> 27:45.753
THAT WE WOULD HAVE HAD
IF I HAD TOLD YOU.

27:45.790 --> 27:48.350
- FINE, I WOULD HAVE ASKED YOU
NOT TO GO.

27:48.400 --> 27:49.651
- I WOULD SAY THAT
THAT IS COMPLETELY UNFAIR

27:49.700 --> 27:50.997
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY

27:51.030 --> 27:53.965
FOR SIX YEARS.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.764
AND I'D ASK YOU
TO COME WITH ME.

27:56.800 --> 27:59.064
- WELL, I WOULD SAY
THAT'S NOT VERY FAIR.

27:59.110 --> 28:00.668
BECAUSE PSYCH IS HERE
AND GUS IS HERE.

28:00.710 --> 28:02.598
AND WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO
IN UGANDA FOR SIX MONTHS

28:02.640 --> 28:04.779
OR LONGER?

28:09.950 --> 28:13.818
- WHERE DOES THAT
LEAVE US, THEN?

28:15.260 --> 28:20.323
- NOW, THAT'S A FAIR QUESTION.

28:26.870 --> 28:29.259
- [grunting]
OKAY, IT'S THE LAST ONE.

28:29.300 --> 28:31.404
- GOT IT, SARGE.

28:31.440 --> 28:34.830
- THANKS FOR SCORING US
THESE DOPE ARMY COSTUMES.

28:34.880 --> 28:35.904
- THEY'RE NOT COSTUMES.

28:35.940 --> 28:37.168
THEY'RE GOVERNMENT-ISSUE
UNIFORMS.

28:37.210 --> 28:39.701
- I WONDER WHERE THAT TRUCK
IS GOING.

28:42.550 --> 28:44.347
- SHAWN, ARE YOU OKAY?

28:44.390 --> 28:47.416
- YEAH.
THAN KS, BUDDY.

28:47.450 --> 28:49.008
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO FIND OUT.

28:49.060 --> 28:50.152
WE GOTTA GET ON THAT TRUCK.

28:50.190 --> 28:51.350
EWAN, HOW WOULD YOU
NORMALLY HANDLE

28:51.390 --> 28:52.926
A SITUATION LIKE THIS?

28:52.960 --> 28:55.190
- TAKE 'EM OUT.
- HMM?

28:55.230 --> 28:57.289
- A LITTLE ELABORATE.
SOMEWHAT UNORTHODOX.

28:57.330 --> 28:58.888
BUT POSSIBLY GENIUS.

28:58.930 --> 29:00.227
GUS, DO WE STILL HAVE
THE NUMBER FOR THAT GUY

29:00.270 --> 29:01.794
WHO CAN GET US TICKETS
FOR MONDAY NIGHT RAW?

29:01.840 --> 29:04.263
- KIRANO. BUT THAT'S NOT
WHAT HE MEANT, SHAWN.

29:04.310 --> 29:07.404
- WAIT A MINUTE, YOU MEAN
YOU WOULD KILL THEM?

29:07.440 --> 29:08.873
- NOT RIGHT AWAY.

29:08.910 --> 29:10.878
BUT USUALLY I'M DEALING
WITH THE ENEMY.

29:10.910 --> 29:12.446
THESE GUYS ARE ON OUR SIDE.

29:12.480 --> 29:13.811
WHAT DO YOU GUYS DO?

29:13.850 --> 29:16.114
- IT'S CALLED CREATING
A DIVERSION.

29:16.150 --> 29:20.689
- HOW DOES THAT WORK?

29:20.720 --> 29:21.880
- UNH...

29:21.920 --> 29:25.185
- HEY!

29:25.230 --> 29:26.527
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
OUT OF YOUR BARRACKS

29:26.560 --> 29:27.788
AFTER LIGHTS OUT, SON?

29:27.830 --> 29:30.321
- UH I WAS JUST
TAKING A STROLL.

29:30.360 --> 29:32.499
- TAKING A STROLL?

29:32.530 --> 29:36.261
WHAT ARE YOU, SOLDIER,
SOME KIND OF DANDY?

29:36.300 --> 29:38.439
GET DOWN ON THE GROUND.
- I'M SORRY?

29:38.470 --> 29:41.405
- HIT THE DECK, MAGGOT!

29:41.440 --> 29:43.579
ALL RIGHT, YOU START
GIVING ME PUSH-UPS,

29:43.610 --> 29:44.645
AND I MEAN GOOD ONES,

29:44.680 --> 29:45.840
ALL THE WAY UP
AND ALL THE WAY DOWN,

29:45.880 --> 29:47.199
OR YOU WILL START OVER.

29:47.250 --> 29:50.742
START!
YOU MISS YOUR MOMMY YET?

29:50.780 --> 29:52.816
- I DO, I GUESS.
- YOU GUESS?

29:52.850 --> 29:55.057
YOU HAVE A GIRLY
YOU WRITE TO BACK HOME?

29:55.090 --> 29:57.217
- NO, BUT I HAVE BEEN GIVING
THAT SOME THOUGHT LATELY.

29:57.260 --> 30:00.320
- YOU THINK I WANT TO HEAR A
MONOLOGUE ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS?

30:00.360 --> 30:03.796
- NO--NO, SIR.
- KEEP GOING!

30:03.830 --> 30:05.024
DO YOU EVEN WANT
TO BE HERE, SON?

30:05.070 --> 30:07.163
- I DON'T KNOW.
I'M NOT TOO SURE.

30:07.200 --> 30:10.328
- NOT TOO SURE?
I WILL ASK YOU AGAIN.

30:10.370 --> 30:13.066
DO YOU WANT TO BE HERE?

30:13.110 --> 30:14.702
- I DO, SIR, I DO!

30:14.740 --> 30:18.107
- WHY IS THAT, PRIVATE?
- I GOT NOWHERE ELSE TO GO!

30:18.150 --> 30:20.038
I GOT NOWHERE ELSE TO--

30:20.080 --> 30:22.674
- PATH ETIC!

30:22.720 --> 30:26.383
SERGEANT POWELL KEEPS
SENDING ME YOU GUYS!

30:35.930 --> 30:38.091
- [grunting]

30:38.130 --> 30:39.768
- NICE, BUDDY.

30:39.800 --> 30:41.097
YOU WERE TOTALLY
DOING LINES FROM

30:41.140 --> 30:42.266
AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN.

30:42.300 --> 30:43.699
- I DON'T KNOW WHERE
IT CAME FROM.

30:43.740 --> 30:46.208
Y'KNOW, LOU GOSSETT WAS LIKE MY
PRETEND DAD AFTER THAT MOVIE.

30:46.240 --> 30:49.698
- YEAH, I FELT THE SAME WAY
AFTER ENEMY MINE.

31:01.660 --> 31:03.218
OVER HERE.

31:18.540 --> 31:20.064
- IT'S WALLACH?

31:20.110 --> 31:22.476
- HE HAD HIS OWN OPERATION
SELLING WEAPONS ON THE SIDE.

31:22.510 --> 31:24.239
- THIS MUST BE WHAT
STARKS SAW THAT NIGHT.

31:24.280 --> 31:26.373
HE HAD A CONSCIENCE.
HE DIDN'T JUST BLINDLY FOLLOW.

31:26.410 --> 31:28.514
HE QUESTIONED, AND HE
REPORTED IT TO WALLACH.

31:28.550 --> 31:30.347
- BUT HE WAS EXACTLY
THE WRONG PERSON TO TELL IT TO.

31:30.380 --> 31:32.712
- WALLACH KILLED HIM
IN THAT MOTEL ROOM.

31:37.490 --> 31:40.653
AND, UH...DON'T--
DON'T BE OFFENDED BY THIS,

31:40.690 --> 31:46.663
BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS YOU WHO
WAS SOMEHOW BEHIND ALL THIS.

31:46.700 --> 31:48.190
[man speaks indistinctly]

31:49.440 --> 31:50.589
- I'VE NEVER MET A MAN
WHO'S SO BIG

31:50.640 --> 31:52.130
HE COULDN'T
HIDE BEHIND A PLANE.

31:52.170 --> 31:54.638
[man shouting indistinctly]

31:57.380 --> 31:59.041
-AAH!

32:01.180 --> 32:03.068
[gunfire]

32:03.120 --> 32:05.281
WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THIS
AND MAKE A PLAN.

32:05.320 --> 32:06.787
- STAY HERE!
- OKAY.

32:10.660 --> 32:11.649
[clang]

32:16.730 --> 32:18.368
[gunfire
and indistinct shouting]

32:22.370 --> 32:24.531
[tires screech]

32:24.570 --> 32:26.629
[gunfire]

32:36.250 --> 32:37.979
[man shouting
in foreign language]

32:39.550 --> 32:40.847
[tires screech]

32:50.030 --> 32:51.725
- LET'S GO! COME ON!

32:51.770 --> 32:52.896
- YOU SAID TO STAY HERE.

32:52.930 --> 32:54.136
- "STAY HERE."
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID!

32:54.170 --> 32:56.365
- YOU CAN MOVE NOW.
LET'S GO.

32:58.770 --> 32:59.759
COME ON!

33:04.780 --> 33:06.998
[gunfire]

33:12.250 --> 33:13.740
- THEN WALLACH SEES US
FROM A DISTANCE,

33:13.790 --> 33:15.951
BREAKS INTO A CRATE, PULLS OUT
A G-36, AND HE'S GONE.

33:15.990 --> 33:20.120
WE MIGHT HAVE HAD A CHANCE,
BUT IT'S ALL SPECULATION.

33:20.160 --> 33:25.223
- JULES, I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY.
I WAS WRONG.

33:25.270 --> 33:26.965
- FOR ACCUSING MY BROTHER?

33:27.000 --> 33:29.059
- NO, I WAS GONNA SAY
YOU WERE RIGHT.

33:29.100 --> 33:30.362
I LOOKED IT UP--

33:30.400 --> 33:32.106
EVE PLUMB DID DO THREE
EPISODES OF THE LOVE BOAT ,

33:32.140 --> 33:34.074
PLAYING THREE COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT CHARACTERS.

33:34.110 --> 33:35.839
TURNS OUT SHE HAS
A LOT MORE RANGE

33:35.880 --> 33:37.279
THAN I GAVE HER CREDIT FOR.

33:37.310 --> 33:40.438
BUT NOW THAT I'M
THINKING OF IT,

33:40.480 --> 33:44.018
I WAS ALSO WRONG
TO ACCUSE YOUR BROTHER.

33:44.050 --> 33:48.054
HE SAVED OUR LIVES AND, WELL,
I OWE HIM FOR THAT.

33:48.090 --> 33:51.287
- THAT IS VERY SWEET.
- YES, IT IS.

33:51.330 --> 33:53.286
WHAT'S MORE,
I REALLY MEAN IT.

33:53.330 --> 33:55.025
- I'M SURE YOU DO.

33:55.060 --> 33:57.494
BUT IT'S NOT THAT EASY
THIS TIME.

33:59.630 --> 34:01.097
- LISTEN UP!

34:01.140 --> 34:02.994
AT EASE.

34:03.040 --> 34:05.304
AT THIS MOMENT, AND AGAINST
MY BETTER JUDGMENT,

34:05.340 --> 34:07.160
I'M GONNA OVERLOOK
THE BLATANT DISREGARD

34:07.210 --> 34:09.007
FOR THE RULES AND REGULATIONS
OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY,

34:09.040 --> 34:10.268
AND SAY THANK YOU
TO SHAWN SPENCER

34:10.310 --> 34:13.074
AND HIS PARTNER...

34:13.110 --> 34:14.919
GHEE BUTTERSNAPS,

34:14.950 --> 34:16.349
FOR THEIR EFFORTS TO UNCOVER
LIEUTENANT WALLACH'S

34:16.380 --> 34:18.189
CRIMINAL MISCONDUCT.

34:18.220 --> 34:19.619
WE HAVE IDENTIFIED
THE MISSING WEAPONS

34:19.650 --> 34:21.515
AND ARE NOW TRACKING THEM.

34:21.560 --> 34:23.289
AND TO ONE OF OUR OWN,
EWAN O'HARA,

34:23.320 --> 34:27.381
FOR HIS HEROIC ACTIONS IN THIS
ALBEIT UNAUTHORIZED OPERATION.

34:27.430 --> 34:31.366
WE HAVE A MAN ON THE RUN.
WE'RE GONNA FIND HIM.

34:31.400 --> 34:34.198
SO HERE ARE THE PARAMETERS
FOR "OPERATION MANHUNT."

34:34.240 --> 34:36.390
- EXCUSE ME,
MAJOR GENERAL, SIR.

34:36.440 --> 34:38.260
ARE YOU OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS
FOR ALTERNATE NAMES

34:38.310 --> 34:39.368
TO "OPERATION MANHUNT"?

34:39.410 --> 34:42.334
IT SEEMS A LITTLE
ON THE NOSE, SIR.

34:42.380 --> 34:44.371
- FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS,

34:44.410 --> 34:45.547
WE'RE GONNA DO A LOCKDOWN
OF THE BASE.

34:45.580 --> 34:47.775
NO ONE GETS IN,
NO ONE GETS OUT.

34:47.810 --> 34:49.243
THEN I WANT AN INVENTORY DONE

34:49.280 --> 34:51.282
OF ALL THE ARMS ROOMS
ON THE INSTALLATION.

34:51.320 --> 34:54.756
- HEY, EWAN, UH...

34:54.790 --> 34:57.816
LOOK, MAN, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE RULES ARE

34:57.860 --> 35:01.352
FOR SAVING LIVES THESE DAYS,
BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT

35:01.400 --> 35:03.652
IF YOU EVER NEED ANYTHING
XEROXED

35:03.700 --> 35:05.827
OR MIMEOGRAPHED
OR ALPHABETIZED,

35:05.870 --> 35:07.963
GUS IS YOUR MAN.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.059
- NOT NECESSARY. I'M JUST
GLAD YOU GUYS ARE OKAY.

35:10.100 --> 35:11.499
LISTEN, I'M SORRY
I COULDN'T BE THERE

35:11.540 --> 35:12.666
TO HELP YOU NET WALLACH,

35:12.710 --> 35:14.905
BUT I HAVE CONFIDENCE
YOU GUYS WILL DO IT.

35:14.940 --> 35:16.669
THE ARMY HAS A WAY
OF WEEDING OUT BAD SEEDS.

35:16.710 --> 35:17.938
- WHOA, ARE YOU LEAVING?

35:17.980 --> 35:20.471
- YEAH, I GOT A FLIGHT, 0430.

35:20.510 --> 35:23.217
- WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO BE
TO UGANDA, WOULD IT?

35:23.250 --> 35:25.548
[chuckles]

35:25.590 --> 35:28.184
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY
THAT, UH, MAJOR GENERAL FELTS

35:28.220 --> 35:30.586
TURNED OUT TO BE THE GOOD GUY
IN ALL OF THIS.

35:30.620 --> 35:32.759
IF I HADN'T SEEN THE GREAT
SANTINI SO MANY TIMES

35:32.790 --> 35:34.599
I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE
SEEN THAT SOONER.

35:34.630 --> 35:37.349
- DUVALL.
- YEAH, DUVALL.

35:37.400 --> 35:39.960
- IF STARKS DIDN'T DIE,

35:40.000 --> 35:41.399
HE WOULD HAVE HAD
THAT APPOINTMENT WITH FELTS,

35:41.440 --> 35:42.759
AND FELTS WOULD HAVE
FIGURED OUT

35:42.800 --> 35:46.338
THIS WHOLE WEAPONS THING
A LOT SOONER.

35:46.370 --> 35:48.133
- WAIT A MINUTE...

35:50.010 --> 35:51.500
- EWAN, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO THAT.

35:51.550 --> 35:52.744
YOU'VE ALREADY DONE ENOUGH.

35:52.780 --> 35:54.270
AND THANK YOU FOR GETTING US
STARKS' FILE.

35:54.320 --> 35:55.844
I KNOW YOU HAD TO
PULL SOME STRINGS TO DO THAT.

35:55.880 --> 35:58.883
- I WISH WE COULD HAVE
TURNED SOMETHING UP FOR YOU.

35:58.920 --> 36:01.650
TOUGH BREAK.

36:01.690 --> 36:03.658
IT JUST SMELLS LIKE SUICIDE.

36:03.690 --> 36:05.487
- YOU USED TO WORK WITH STARKS
IN THE MOTORCADE.

36:05.530 --> 36:06.622
- YES, I DID.

36:06.660 --> 36:07.957
BUT YOU KNOW THAT.

36:07.990 --> 36:10.891
- HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

36:14.100 --> 36:17.695
- DUDE, WHERE'S EWAN?
- HE LEFT.

36:17.740 --> 36:20.061
- MY GOD, I WAS WRONG.

36:20.110 --> 36:21.839
I MEAN I WAS RIGHT.

36:21.880 --> 36:23.177
I MEAN, I WAS RIGHT,
AND THEN I WAS WRONG.

36:23.210 --> 36:24.404
NOW I'M RIGHT AGAIN.

36:24.450 --> 36:25.542
- YOU'RE NOT MAKING
ANY SENSE, SHAWN.

36:25.580 --> 36:26.842
- WE HAVE TO FOLLOW EWAN.

36:26.880 --> 36:28.347
HE'S UP TO SOMETHING.
I'LL EXPLAIN ON THE WAY.

36:33.620 --> 36:36.487
- WHERE ARE THOSE GUYS GOING?

36:50.370 --> 36:52.406
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
LET'S CALL LASSITER.

36:52.440 --> 36:54.203
- NO TIME FOR THAT, BUDDY.
WE GOTTA GET DOWN THERE.

36:54.240 --> 36:55.207
- I GOT ALL THE TIME
IN THE WORLD.

36:55.240 --> 36:57.572
I'D LIKE TO LIVE. SHAWN!

36:57.610 --> 36:59.578
- EWAN! EWAN, EWAN,
EWAN, EWAN, EWAN.

36:59.610 --> 37:01.510
[chuckles]

37:01.550 --> 37:04.110
ALL THIS TIME I THOUGHT
YOU WERE TRYING TO HELP US

37:04.150 --> 37:05.344
UNCOVER THE TRUTH.

37:05.390 --> 37:07.381
BUT REALLY YOU WERE JUST
TRYING TO SLOW US DOWN

37:07.420 --> 37:08.978
SO THAT YOU COULD
GET TO HIM FIRST.

37:09.020 --> 37:11.921
- WE EACH HAVE OUR JOB, SHAWN.
- YES, WE DO.

37:11.960 --> 37:13.951
OF COURSE, I'VE HAD MANY JOBS.
I'M NOT SURE WHICH ONE

37:13.990 --> 37:15.218
YOU'RE REFERRING TO
SPECIFICALLY.

37:15.260 --> 37:18.024
MY GUESS IS THAT IT'S NOT
MY BRIEF STINT

37:18.060 --> 37:19.823
AS A LOBBYIST FOR M&Ms,

37:19.870 --> 37:21.633
TRYING TO GET THEM TO BRING
BACK THE LIGHT BROWN ONES.

37:21.670 --> 37:23.638
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT,
LET'S NOT GET CAUGHT UP

37:23.670 --> 37:25.103
IN ONE ANOTHER'S
ACHIEVEMENTS.

37:25.140 --> 37:27.131
SUFFICE TO SAY WE BOTH HAVE
VERY IMPRESSIVE RESUMES.

37:27.170 --> 37:30.230
LET'S JUST TALK...OKAY?

37:30.280 --> 37:34.239
MAN TO...MUCH SMALLER,
LESS FIT MAN.

37:34.280 --> 37:37.272
- ALL RIGHT, WALLACH HERE
BROKE AN ARMY CODE.

37:37.320 --> 37:42.519
A CODE BASED ON ALLEGIANCE,
HONOR, HONESTY.

37:42.560 --> 37:43.754
- HOW 'BOUT THIS, EWAN--
HOW 'BOUT--

37:43.790 --> 37:45.223
HOW 'BOUT I BRING THE COPS
IN HERE, HUH?

37:45.260 --> 37:48.184
AND WE ARREST THIS GUY,
SLAP SOME CUFFS ON HIM.

37:48.230 --> 37:49.652
HOW SATISFYING WILL THAT BE
TO WATCH?

37:49.700 --> 37:51.759
I'LL EVEN MAKE SURE LASSIE
MAKES 'EM EXTRA TIGHT

37:51.800 --> 37:53.859
SO THAT THEY CHAFE
AND THEY FLAKE.

37:53.900 --> 37:55.765
AND YOU KNOW, YOU SISTER
WILL GET THE COLLAR.

37:55.800 --> 37:57.768
THAT'S A BONUS.

37:57.800 --> 38:00.200
- I'M NOT TAKING WALLACH
ANYWHERE.

38:00.240 --> 38:01.571
- WAIT A SECOND.
YOU GONNA KILL HIM?

38:01.610 --> 38:02.907
- YES, GUS.

38:02.940 --> 38:04.271
I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT
THE COCKING OF THE GUN

38:04.310 --> 38:05.777
WAS MEANT TO MEAN.
YOU WOULDN'T BE THIS LOST

38:05.810 --> 38:07.846
IF YOU WOULD JUST
COME A LITTLE CLOSER.

38:07.880 --> 38:09.711
- YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL
ABOUT PIERS LIKE THIS, SHAWN.

38:09.750 --> 38:11.172
THEY ARE COVERED
IN PELICAN URINE.

38:11.220 --> 38:12.312
- WHAT?
- SERIOUSLY, SHAWN,

38:12.350 --> 38:13.647
EVERYTHING YOU JUST TOUCHED
IS SOAKED IN IT.

38:13.690 --> 38:14.816
I'M GOOD WHERE I AM.

38:14.860 --> 38:16.987
- SHAWN,
YOU'RE A GOOD DETECTIVE.

38:17.020 --> 38:18.055
YOU'VE GOT A GOOD THING
GOING HERE.

38:18.090 --> 38:19.887
ON TOP OF THAT,

38:19.930 --> 38:21.352
MY SISTER LIKES YOU
AND SO DO I.

38:21.400 --> 38:24.119
BUT WE ALL HAVE ORDERS.

38:24.160 --> 38:26.492
AND I'M STILL ALIVE
BECAUSE I FOLLOW MINE.

38:26.530 --> 38:28.634
SO WHY DON'T YOU
AND YOUR BUDDY HERE--

38:28.670 --> 38:30.297
- SERIOUSLY?
THE NAME IS GUS!

38:30.340 --> 38:32.069
GUS!

38:32.110 --> 38:34.908
- TURN AROUND, WALK OUT.

38:34.940 --> 38:36.737
FORGET YOU EVER SAW ME.

38:36.780 --> 38:40.443
GO HAVE A DRINK.
TOAST TO A JOB WELL DONE.

38:40.480 --> 38:42.778
LEAVE ME TO DO
WHAT I HAVE TO DO.

38:42.820 --> 38:44.879
WE CAN LIVE WITH THAT,
CAN'T WE?

38:45.990 --> 38:47.685
- I CAN'T.

38:48.820 --> 38:50.651
- EASY, LITTLE SIS.

38:50.690 --> 38:52.829
- DROP IT, EWAN.

38:52.860 --> 38:56.990
- WE BOTH KNOW YOU'RE NOT GONNA
SHOOT YOUR OLDER BROTHER.

38:57.030 --> 38:59.294
- NO, BUT I WILL.

39:01.330 --> 39:02.934
- I COULD MAKE THIS
VERY COM PLICATED

39:02.970 --> 39:05.063
FOR YOU RIGHT NOW.

39:05.110 --> 39:07.237
- WHAT IS THIS EVEN ABOUT?

39:07.270 --> 39:11.741
YOU'RE PROTECTING THE ARMY
FROM SOME BAD PUBLICITY?

39:11.780 --> 39:13.839
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE EWAN I KNEW?

39:15.580 --> 39:18.947
YOU KNOW YOU'RE THE REASON
I BECAME A COP?

39:18.990 --> 39:21.515
YOU GAVE ME THE CONFIDENCE
TO GO FOR IT,

39:21.560 --> 39:23.255
AND I DID.

39:23.290 --> 39:24.723
I BECAME ONE.

39:24.760 --> 39:26.887
AND NOW I HAVE A JOB TO DO,
AND THAT IS TO UPHOLD THE LAW.

39:26.930 --> 39:29.558
AND NO ONE IS ABOVE THAT.

39:29.600 --> 39:31.625
WALLACH IS GONNA GO TO JAIL
FOR WHAT HE DID,

39:31.670 --> 39:35.561
AND SO ARE YOU.
SO...

39:35.600 --> 39:39.559

USED AGAINST YOU
IN A COURT OF LAW.

40:03.530 --> 40:05.361
[handcuffs snapping]

40:11.300 --> 40:14.098

I REALLY HATE THAT I WAS RIGHT.

40:34.630 --> 40:38.293
THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT

- MAYBE. I MEAN IT'S--
IT'S NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION.

IT'S THE HOLE IN THE GROUND
AS A TOILET THING

41:10.560 --> 41:12.494
THAT'S GIVING ME PAUSE,
PRIMARILY.

OUR SHARE OF THAT.

EXACTLY WHEN YOU GET BACK.

41:33.090 --> 41:35.513
