OLIVER: <i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

00:03.170 --> 00:04.206
No, Adrian!

00:05.047 --> 00:06.879
The two of you are
working for Ricardo Diaz.

00:06.965 --> 00:08.797
You're both fired
effective immediately.

00:09.051 --> 00:12.294
<i>Obviously, the Mayor terminated us
to impede the prosecution</i>

is an impeachable offense.</i>

00:16.391 --> 00:19.759
The way you lead alienates everyone

00:19.937 --> 00:21.644
and everything around you. Look...

00:21.730 --> 00:24.643
You put the team at risk by lying.

00:24.733 --> 00:28.647
You leave a trail of bodies
every damn place that you go.

00:28.737 --> 00:31.946
My trail of bodies
does not include my own brother.

00:32.031 --> 00:33.989
Truth is, Oliver, you have
become a better man,

00:34.076 --> 00:35.533
but with your focus split,

00:35.869 --> 00:37.076
a worse leader.

00:37.162 --> 00:40.246
If I'm gonna be the best version
of myself, it can't be with you.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.251
You told Rebecca what's going on?

00:45.671 --> 00:47.128
You kidding?
She'd have my nuts in a vise

00:47.214 --> 00:48.375
if she knows I was on the take.

00:48.465 --> 00:50.331
She doesn't get it.
It's a different city now.

00:50.425 --> 00:51.415
It's a different world.

00:52.844 --> 00:54.255
We better call back up.

00:54.346 --> 00:56.633

- It's not. Call back up now.

02:36.948 --> 02:38.610
You know, they can't
actually impeach you for firing

02:38.700 --> 02:40.236
two people on Diaz's payroll.

02:40.619 --> 02:43.077
They can if they claim
I did it to protect myself.

02:43.372 --> 02:47.867
We need rock-solid proof
that they're working for Diaz.

02:47.959 --> 02:48.949
That's why you have me.

02:49.044 --> 02:50.580
But in the meantime,
I have something else.

02:50.962 --> 02:54.251
I just have some more evidence on
how Diaz has corrupted the SCPD.

02:54.341 --> 02:56.628
So, ever since Dinah and
company got fired,

02:56.718 --> 02:59.756
I have been monitoring
the station's internal security feed.

02:59.846 --> 03:01.132
Every night at 10:13,

03:01.223 --> 03:02.430
this happens.

03:03.517 --> 03:04.507
Whoop!

03:04.601 --> 03:06.012
Forty-five minutes later,

03:06.186 --> 03:08.473
the feed goes back online
like clockwork.

03:08.855 --> 03:10.687
He's monitoring his minions-in-blue.

03:11.358 --> 03:13.065
- He's gotta be.
- I agree.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.521
If you're thinking
what I think you're thinking,

03:14.611 --> 03:16.022
you need to stop
thinking it right now. It's bad.

03:16.113 --> 03:18.400
I can't make a move
on Diaz unless I know where he is.

03:18.573 --> 03:22.032
And you just told me where he is
every night at 10:13.

03:22.119 --> 03:24.236
You can't storm the bad cop
castle by yourself, Oliver.

03:24.329 --> 03:26.946
- It's suicide.
- If I get Diaz, this is all done.

03:27.040 --> 03:30.499
The investigation,
the corruption, the impeachment...

03:30.585 --> 03:32.121
All of it, I stop all of it.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.828
You can't go there alone.

03:33.922 --> 03:35.379
You will not come out.

03:36.299 --> 03:37.335
You need help.

03:37.426 --> 03:38.712
All of our help quit.

03:39.678 --> 03:41.670
Well, maybe John
has changed his mind.

03:42.639 --> 03:43.629
What are you talking about?

03:43.724 --> 03:44.885
JOHN: Hey, Oliver.

03:50.605 --> 03:51.595
John?

03:53.775 --> 03:55.562
- What do you need?
- Well, Felicity said that

03:55.652 --> 03:58.235
she needed to update
the code on my chip.

03:58.905 --> 04:00.521
She also said that
you would be at City Hall.

04:00.615 --> 04:02.902
Well, I said he might be.

04:02.993 --> 04:04.655
I didn't say he would be.

04:04.745 --> 04:05.861
And, yeah, I parent-trapped you,

04:05.954 --> 04:08.162
but it was a little naive
of you to think that I wouldn't

04:08.248 --> 04:09.864
considering how well
you know me, you know.

04:10.834 --> 04:13.247
Now that we are all together,

04:13.336 --> 04:15.498
we can talk about what happened.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.546
I'm pretty sure John has
said everything he needs to say.

04:17.632 --> 04:18.964
I think you're absolutely right.
I did.

04:19.050 --> 04:20.040
Guys!

04:20.135 --> 04:22.091
This isn't about
what he said, or what he said,

04:22.179 --> 04:24.045
or your egos. We have
bigger problems at hand here.

04:24.139 --> 04:25.300
We need to stop Diaz.

04:25.474 --> 04:26.635
And we have some pretty good intel.

04:26.725 --> 04:27.841
Good intel tends to fall apart

04:27.934 --> 04:29.675
in the hands of bad leadership,
don't you think?

04:29.770 --> 04:31.557
Oliver, come on,
it doesn't have to be that way.

04:31.855 --> 04:33.096
How would you like it to be?

04:35.817 --> 04:37.308
Well, it doesn't change
the fact that neither of you

04:37.402 --> 04:38.392
can take down Diaz alone.

04:38.570 --> 04:40.277
I think there's more
than one way to catch Diaz.

04:40.655 --> 04:42.863
I've been offered a job at A.R.G.U.S.

04:42.949 --> 04:43.939
Are you gonna take it?

04:44.034 --> 04:45.400
I'm thinking about it. Why?

04:45.494 --> 04:47.736
Last time you needed something
from A.R.G.U.S., you had to steal it.

04:48.205 --> 04:49.195
Oliver.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.828
You keep that attitude, man,
you're gonna end up all alone.

04:53.710 --> 04:56.043
I have listened to your advice
for the last six years.

04:57.756 --> 04:59.338
I think I've earned a reprieve.

05:04.721 --> 05:07.555
That is not how
I thought that would go.

05:07.641 --> 05:08.677
JOHN: Sure it was.

05:08.934 --> 05:10.470
This is who he is, Felicity.

05:10.936 --> 05:12.768
And no one knows that more than you.

05:17.192 --> 05:18.683
Elected officials cannot fire

05:18.777 --> 05:22.145
the very law enforcement
personnel investigating them.

05:22.239 --> 05:24.777
To do so, is the definition
of obstruction of justice.

05:24.866 --> 05:28.030
Captain Hill and D.A. Armand were
actively sabotaging the city

05:28.119 --> 05:30.202
by allying themselves
with Ricardo Diaz.

05:30.705 --> 05:34.324
I was not obstructing justice.
I was serving it.

05:34.417 --> 05:38.957
From what I understand, Ricardo Diaz
is a second-rate drug dealer

05:39.047 --> 05:41.255
who was released
from prison on a technicality.

05:41.508 --> 05:42.874
I fail to see your point.

05:42.968 --> 05:46.177
The idea that he could
compromise a police captain

05:46.263 --> 05:49.097
and a District Attorney is laughable.

05:49.182 --> 05:52.016
I assume that the Mayor
will get a chance

05:52.102 --> 05:55.095
to address the City Council,
lay out the facts as he sees them?

05:55.188 --> 05:58.977
Preliminary impeachment
proceedings begin this afternoon.

05:59.442 --> 06:02.685
The Mayor will have a chance
to plead his case, of course.

06:02.946 --> 06:05.734
For your sake, Mr. Mayor, and
for the sake of your administration,

06:05.824 --> 06:09.192
I hope you have something
more concrete to offer the council

06:09.286 --> 06:12.324
other than unsupported suspicions.

06:15.250 --> 06:18.038
And I know we haven't
always gotten along,

06:18.128 --> 06:21.087
but I do believe in due process.

06:21.339 --> 06:25.174
I'll make sure the council
approaches this fairly.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.593
I will see you and
the council this afternoon

06:27.679 --> 06:28.715
with evidence.

06:33.852 --> 06:35.969
You mind if I ask
what evidence exactly?

06:36.062 --> 06:37.098
Felicity's working on it.

06:37.188 --> 06:38.850
I guess that's
somewhat reassuring.

06:38.940 --> 06:41.728
On the bright side, if I
get impeached, you get promoted.

06:41.818 --> 06:44.561
(CHUCKLES) I'm not much
of a politician, Oliver.

06:44.654 --> 06:47.818
Well, with Diaz running the city
it's not really politics, is it?

06:48.575 --> 06:50.191
Is that the only thing bothering you?

06:50.285 --> 06:51.275
Diaz?

06:53.079 --> 06:54.160
You've looked better.

06:54.456 --> 06:55.617
John quit.

06:58.001 --> 06:59.537
I'd say he quit the team, but

07:01.046 --> 07:02.207
there's no team.

07:04.341 --> 07:06.003
He seems to think
I'm to blame for that.

07:06.092 --> 07:08.300
- Well, I don't see it that way.
- You're not there, Quentin.

07:08.386 --> 07:09.376
Yeah, I know.

07:09.679 --> 07:12.137
But I was there when
The Hood first showed up, remember?

07:12.474 --> 07:14.682
QUENTIN: And that guy bears
very little resemblance

07:14.768 --> 07:16.009
to the guy I'm talking to now.

07:16.102 --> 07:18.560
I mean, look at you, you're
the mayor, you're a family man.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.896
You're out busting
your hump every night for this city.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.482
I've seen how much
you've changed, Oliver.

07:23.568 --> 07:24.809
So, why is all this happening?

07:24.903 --> 07:27.190
QUENTIN: Cayden James and Diaz,
they've done a number.

07:27.572 --> 07:30.406
But things will get better.
You just gotta stay the course.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.401
QUENTIN: Where are you going?

07:33.703 --> 07:37.037
Going to check in on Felicity,
see if she's making any progress.

07:37.123 --> 07:40.833
And I promised William that
I'd take him to his science fair.

07:41.628 --> 07:42.789
It's not the best timing.

07:42.879 --> 07:44.620
I think schools plan it that way.

07:48.093 --> 07:49.504
William, you outdid me.

07:49.594 --> 07:52.052
For my science fair project,
all I did was hack Napster.

07:52.138 --> 07:53.174
What's Napster?

07:54.099 --> 07:56.216
Wow, I am getting
older by the minute.

07:56.893 --> 07:58.134
I can't believe you cloned a cabbage.

07:58.228 --> 08:00.720
When I was a girl,
cabbage grew in the ground.

08:00.897 --> 08:02.354
Well, you're a long way
from home, Raisa.

08:02.440 --> 08:03.430
That I know.

08:03.525 --> 08:04.811
I'll put these in the car.

08:04.901 --> 08:06.017
Thank you.

08:06.111 --> 08:08.979
I just really hope it's better than
Sarah Epstein's solar hot dog cooker.

08:09.280 --> 08:11.237
She's really been talking it up.

08:11.574 --> 08:13.190
We're going to be late. Where's Dad?

08:13.284 --> 08:14.274
- He'll be here...
- Hey.

08:14.494 --> 08:15.610
Finally, let's go.

08:15.704 --> 08:18.492
Yeah, I know. I just gotta talk
to Felicity for one second.

08:18.581 --> 08:20.698
- But we're already late.
- Just a minute, I promise.

08:23.920 --> 08:25.411
Council's convening.

08:25.714 --> 08:28.297
I promised them
I would show them something.

08:28.383 --> 08:29.499
Prepare to be happy.

08:29.592 --> 08:30.924
Documentation of threats from Diaz

08:31.011 --> 08:33.173
to Hill's family and
bank statements proving

08:33.263 --> 08:35.049
that he paid for Armand's
son's cancer treatment.

08:35.140 --> 08:36.130
That's it. That's good work.

08:36.224 --> 08:37.931
Yeah, it's really good work.
It might be too good work.

08:38.143 --> 08:40.179
Without the SCPD, the only
person that can really obtain

08:40.270 --> 08:41.351
this type of evidence is...

08:41.438 --> 08:43.145
Well, as far as
the council is concerned, is...

08:44.232 --> 08:45.814
- You.
- Are you telling me that

08:45.900 --> 08:47.937
the single piece
of evidence that will stop

08:48.028 --> 08:50.520
this imminent impeachment
is also the evidence

08:50.613 --> 08:52.570
that will directly connect me
to being the Green Arrow?

08:52.657 --> 08:54.239
I mean, you can tell them that
you're married to a super-hacker.

08:54.325 --> 08:55.315
- It's not funny.
- I know,

08:55.410 --> 08:58.198
I tried to plant a fake trail,
it's just that I ran out of time...

08:58.288 --> 08:59.620
You ran out of time,

08:59.706 --> 09:02.744
because you're focusing
on making John and I reconcile

09:02.834 --> 09:04.541
instead of doing your job.

09:04.627 --> 09:06.584
Hey, I'm on your side here.

09:06.671 --> 09:07.787
OLIVER: Are you on my side?
FELICITY: Yes, of course...

09:07.881 --> 09:09.372
- Are you sure you're on my side?
- How can you say something like that?

09:09.466 --> 09:10.456
What is wrong with you?

09:10.550 --> 09:11.631
Dad, you said
you'll only be a minute.

09:11.718 --> 09:13.050
I'm in the middle
of something, please.

09:13.136 --> 09:15.628
- We're gonna be late.
- Well then, we're gonna be late!

09:22.062 --> 09:23.223
Buddy, I'm really sorry.

09:25.648 --> 09:27.230
- Get out.
- Felicity, it was an accident.

09:27.317 --> 09:29.024
I will take care of William.

09:30.528 --> 09:31.609
Get out.

09:44.542 --> 09:45.874
(KNOCKING)

09:50.381 --> 09:51.371
(GASPING)

09:51.466 --> 09:52.456
What's wrong?

09:52.550 --> 09:55.133
Looks like you half expected me to be
a member of the League of Assassins.

09:55.220 --> 09:58.463
No, I thought I heard something.

10:00.266 --> 10:02.383
- How's William?
- He won't come out of his room.

10:03.144 --> 10:04.134
Look, I don't...

10:05.730 --> 10:07.221
I have no idea what came over me,

10:07.315 --> 10:10.729
what made me lose it
on him like that.

10:12.320 --> 10:14.152
Everything's piling up.

10:14.364 --> 10:15.480
FELICITY: Yeah, I know.

10:16.658 --> 10:18.274
I think we should
take some space, Oliver.

10:28.419 --> 10:29.500
I'm sorry, what?

10:29.587 --> 10:30.703
How you lost it on William,

10:31.506 --> 10:33.668
that is crossing a line.

10:34.092 --> 10:35.833
FELICITY: I know that you
have a lot on your plate.

10:35.927 --> 10:38.169
Diaz, John, then the impeachment,

10:38.263 --> 10:41.256
but that is no excuse. It can't
be an excuse. He is your son.

10:41.683 --> 10:43.845
And you just showed him
the man his father really is.

10:46.437 --> 10:48.053
That is not the man that I married.

11:02.036 --> 11:03.152
(KNOCKING)

11:04.164 --> 11:05.154
Hey.

11:07.876 --> 11:08.912
You okay?

11:09.002 --> 11:09.992
Thanks for coming.

11:10.086 --> 11:13.750
QUENTIN: Listen, I've... I know
I've said this already, but

11:14.549 --> 11:15.665
you don't look good.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.041
Felicity...

11:21.181 --> 11:22.763
Felicity found proof that

11:23.683 --> 11:25.470
Hill and Armand are in bed with Diaz.

11:25.560 --> 11:26.641
That's great.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.177
It's great.

11:29.856 --> 11:31.722
Why you got a face
that says otherwise?

11:31.816 --> 11:34.024
Council's gonna ask me
how I got that evidence.

11:34.110 --> 11:36.648
And you don't exactly
wanna tell them it's your wife.

11:36.738 --> 11:40.072
Just shine a big fat light
on the suspicion I'm the Green Arrow.

11:41.576 --> 11:42.783
What are you gonna do?

11:43.411 --> 11:44.572
I don't know.

11:47.790 --> 11:49.497
My wife wants a separation.

11:51.377 --> 11:53.334
I lost my temper in front of my son.

11:55.423 --> 11:56.413
I scared him.

11:57.759 --> 11:59.045
It was really bad.

11:59.344 --> 12:02.382
Well, you know,
just apologize to the kid,

12:02.472 --> 12:04.304
sleep on the couch
for tonight, and...

12:05.016 --> 12:06.973
A separation just seems
a little extreme.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.473
But, Quentin, with everything
that's been happening,

12:11.648 --> 12:13.014
it feels like par for the course.

12:13.107 --> 12:14.097
You're talking about John Diggle?

12:14.192 --> 12:17.185
John, Curtis, Rene, Dinah...

12:18.029 --> 12:19.315
Why haven't you quit?

12:19.906 --> 12:21.192
The promise of a raise.

12:22.909 --> 12:23.899
(GROANS)

12:24.786 --> 12:25.867
You said...

12:26.329 --> 12:28.616
You said I've changed.
I appreciate what you said.

12:34.379 --> 12:36.211
Why does everyone keep leaving me?

12:37.257 --> 12:38.748
It's the thing about change, right?

12:40.051 --> 12:43.670
You hope you're doing the right thing
by becoming a better person,

12:44.264 --> 12:46.472
but you're also
becoming a different person.

12:46.808 --> 12:47.844
Some people, they just...

12:48.226 --> 12:50.309
I guess, like John,
they just react badly.

12:50.395 --> 12:51.931
That's one possibility.

12:52.021 --> 12:53.011
What's the other?

12:53.106 --> 12:54.313
That I haven't really changed at all.

12:54.440 --> 12:57.148
(SCOFFS) Come on, I don't buy that.

12:57.652 --> 12:59.894
QUENTIN: What you told me about John
and Curtis, all those guys,

12:59.988 --> 13:00.978
they got their own issues.

13:01.072 --> 13:02.529
They're just putting them on you.

13:02.991 --> 13:04.198
And Felicity?

13:05.994 --> 13:07.735
Felicity loves you, man.

13:08.746 --> 13:09.827
QUENTIN: That thing with her
and William,

13:09.914 --> 13:11.280
it's gonna blow over.
Don't worry about that.

13:12.083 --> 13:13.324
My advice,

13:13.918 --> 13:16.786
you just gotta focus on what's
right in front of us now, okay?

13:18.464 --> 13:20.000
I'm gonna reach out
to Samanda Watson.

13:20.091 --> 13:21.627
Maybe she can help cover us on this.

13:21.718 --> 13:23.004
Quentin, the woman
wants me in prison.

13:23.094 --> 13:24.801
But she also wants justice, right?

13:24.887 --> 13:27.379
Taking down a crime boss
who's overrun a city

13:27.724 --> 13:29.181
seems to fit the bill in my eyes.

13:30.393 --> 13:31.884
Yeah, call her.

13:33.563 --> 13:34.895
Now, listen.

13:35.231 --> 13:36.893
That council meeting's in an hour.

13:36.983 --> 13:38.190
I gotta focus.

13:38.735 --> 13:41.944
I gotta push this stuff
out of my head, but I'll be there.

13:42.196 --> 13:43.687
See you back at City Hall.

13:52.540 --> 13:53.997
(KNOCKING)

13:59.380 --> 14:01.292
(INTENSE MUSIC PLAYING)

14:03.760 --> 14:05.501
(KNOCKING CONTINUES)

14:14.228 --> 14:15.344
Hello, Oliver.

14:15.438 --> 14:16.554
Long time.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.019
No, you...

14:21.069 --> 14:22.059
You killed yourself.

14:22.320 --> 14:23.310
Funny thing.

14:23.780 --> 14:25.988
You never did go back for my body.

14:26.574 --> 14:28.782
Guess you were
somewhat preoccupied, right?

14:29.327 --> 14:30.317
Still

14:30.787 --> 14:32.028
seems a little careless.

14:32.705 --> 14:33.786
(GUNSHOT)

14:33.873 --> 14:35.114
Come on, man.

14:35.333 --> 14:37.996
You've seen people come back from
what seemed like certain death.

14:38.503 --> 14:39.619
As I recall,

14:41.047 --> 14:42.629
you once were stabbed

14:42.882 --> 14:44.714
and fell off of a mountain,

14:44.801 --> 14:46.337
yet, here you are.

14:46.511 --> 14:48.343
(MULTIPLE GUNSHOTS)

14:51.682 --> 14:53.548
(BOTH GRUNTING)

15:23.714 --> 15:24.750
Do it.

15:25.174 --> 15:26.415
I didn't last time.

15:26.634 --> 15:28.967
And then I killed
the mother of your son.

15:29.887 --> 15:31.674
I'm not playing games this time.

15:32.181 --> 15:35.891
(GROANING) This time, I'm coming
for you and Felicity and William.

15:36.144 --> 15:39.137
Anyone and everyone
who's ever been close to you.

15:40.648 --> 15:44.062
There's only one way
that you can stop me.

15:51.701 --> 15:53.442
(GASPING)

16:10.511 --> 16:11.968
(KNOCKING)

16:18.144 --> 16:20.636
ADRIAN: Now, wasn't that better?

16:21.147 --> 16:22.354
You know,

16:23.024 --> 16:25.767
you might just have to
start considering the possibility

16:25.860 --> 16:28.443
that I'm just not killable, Oliver.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.191
No, Adrian.

16:35.995 --> 16:36.985
You're dead.

16:39.165 --> 16:40.576
You're still on Lian Yu.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.091
I'm hallucinating.

17:07.318 --> 17:08.398
ADRIAN: I knew you'd kill me.

17:08.778 --> 17:10.064
Or try to.

17:10.570 --> 17:13.984
I always was the one person
who saw you for the murderer you are.

17:15.284 --> 17:16.273
What are you doing?

17:17.203 --> 17:18.193
Oh.

17:19.413 --> 17:21.154
You're running a blood test.

17:21.249 --> 17:23.286
You think you've been
dosed with something.

17:23.459 --> 17:24.575
You know,

17:25.086 --> 17:27.954
there is another explanation,
a more likely one,

17:28.297 --> 17:30.084
in my considered opinion.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.509
You're finally going crazy.

17:34.845 --> 17:38.009
It's completely understandable,
Ollie, you've lost every thing,

17:38.182 --> 17:40.799
even the people I couldn't
manage to take from you.

17:40.977 --> 17:42.559
I really like this Ricardo Diaz.

17:42.645 --> 17:44.807
If he didn't exist, I'd have to
think him up myself.

17:45.314 --> 17:47.146
He's going about
all this exactly right.

17:47.233 --> 17:51.227
Don't hurt the people that you love,

17:53.197 --> 17:55.439
just get them all to abandon you.

17:56.158 --> 17:58.024
It's actually the easiest
thing in the world.

17:58.119 --> 18:00.452
I told you this, Ollie,
I told you this, man.

18:00.538 --> 18:03.121
Everything you touch dies.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.579
What you're going through right now,

18:06.669 --> 18:08.911
losing your team, your wife,

18:09.005 --> 18:10.621
the impeachment, all of it,

18:10.715 --> 18:13.458
it's happening just like
I told you it would.

18:13.718 --> 18:18.713
And nothing in that
blood test is gonna change that.

18:19.390 --> 18:20.722
(BEEPING)

18:24.645 --> 18:25.635
Well?

18:26.105 --> 18:27.095
Vertigo.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.399
It was absorbed through my...

18:36.449 --> 18:37.439
Kullens.

18:37.617 --> 18:38.607
Friend of yours?

18:39.619 --> 18:40.609
Apparently not.

18:48.544 --> 18:50.957
ADRIAN: Don't. Don't go talk to Quentin.

18:51.047 --> 18:53.585
You're not in the state of mind
to be talking to him right now.

18:53.924 --> 18:55.506
He might have you committed,

18:56.427 --> 18:57.884
which would be a shame,

18:57.970 --> 19:01.008
since by my count, he's the only
person still left in your corner.

19:01.682 --> 19:03.298
Okay, Felicity,
William and I will be fine.

19:03.392 --> 19:04.758
I just need to talk to them.

19:04.852 --> 19:06.388
Maybe. But what about the rest?

19:06.479 --> 19:08.186
It's tough to say
you're in a good place

19:08.272 --> 19:10.229
when your oldest friend
leaves you high and dry.

19:10.316 --> 19:11.557
John made his choice.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.643
Deep down, you know he's right.

19:13.736 --> 19:15.944
You've changed, sure.

19:16.113 --> 19:20.027
Maybe you are a better Oliver Queen,

19:20.117 --> 19:22.951
a happier Oliver Queen.

19:26.457 --> 19:29.325
But it has sure made you
a worse hero.

19:29.585 --> 19:31.326
You have a wife, a son,

19:31.420 --> 19:33.878
you're the mayor,
all of which, yes, may be going away,

19:33.964 --> 19:36.251
but still, it's a fair assumption

19:38.469 --> 19:40.552
you're stretched too thin, buddy.

19:40.930 --> 19:44.264
Maybe you've gotten so good
at being Oliver Queen,

19:44.350 --> 19:48.060
that the Green Arrow's
mission is suffering.

19:48.354 --> 19:52.189
You may be happier,
but the people that you love,

19:52.817 --> 19:53.807
they're not.

19:55.569 --> 19:57.481
Hey, what's Vertigo do?

19:58.698 --> 20:00.189
Does it show you your worst fear?

20:00.282 --> 20:02.319
You're not my worst fear, Adrian.

20:04.453 --> 20:05.660
You're nowhere close.

20:06.539 --> 20:07.529
Oh.

20:08.207 --> 20:10.540
I know. Your worst fear is yourself.

20:11.043 --> 20:12.955
Your worst enemy is yourself.

20:13.754 --> 20:19.045
Guys like me, Ricardo Diaz,
Damien Darhk, Ra's al Ghul...

20:19.343 --> 20:21.801
When it comes
to destroying you, Oliver,

20:22.847 --> 20:25.089
we all come in second place.

20:31.313 --> 20:33.726
You're the one enemy
you can't defeat.

20:39.864 --> 20:41.105
(PHONE RINGING AND VIBRATING)

20:43.993 --> 20:44.983
Yes, Quentin.

20:45.578 --> 20:46.989
Hearing's about to start,
where the hell are you?

20:47.079 --> 20:51.494
Well, Kullens dosed me with Vertigo,
and I've been dealing with it.

20:51.584 --> 20:54.372
Didn't you say that Diaz was
dealing Vertigo these days?

20:54.462 --> 20:56.920
Well, Kullens is working
for Diaz apparently.

20:57.006 --> 20:59.214
OLIVER: <i>Now, listen.
Where are we with Agent Watson?</i>

20:59.300 --> 21:00.507
She's mulling it over.

21:00.593 --> 21:01.800
She gotta mull faster.

21:01.886 --> 21:03.127
QUENTIN: <i>All right, I'll give her
another call.</i>

21:03.220 --> 21:05.587
Listen, just get down here
as fast as you can. All right?

21:05.681 --> 21:06.671
I'm on my way.

21:32.041 --> 21:33.031
LAUREL: Ollie.

21:37.630 --> 21:38.962
Why are you looking at me like that?

21:40.216 --> 21:41.206
(SIGHS)

21:46.388 --> 21:49.347
Ollie, are you okay?

21:50.267 --> 21:51.599
I don't know.

21:51.685 --> 21:52.846
You know, if you tell her the truth,

21:52.937 --> 21:55.054
she'll just think
you're crazy, Oliver.

21:55.689 --> 21:58.272
You'll break her heart
all over again, nobody wants that.

21:58.984 --> 22:01.818
Hey. Hey, you can
tell me anything, you know that.

22:02.238 --> 22:03.524
I know that.

22:06.575 --> 22:07.816
I need to leave.

22:07.910 --> 22:09.321
I thought the boat left at 6:00.

22:09.787 --> 22:10.777
What?

22:10.871 --> 22:13.864
The <i>Gambit.</i> The trip that you're
going on with your father.

22:13.958 --> 22:16.575
I ran into Sara. She said
that you hadn't packed yet.

22:16.669 --> 22:17.785
Do you want me to help you?

22:18.128 --> 22:20.745
Look at how innocent she was,
how much she loved you.

22:21.382 --> 22:22.964
You destroyed that.

22:23.050 --> 22:25.542
- Ollie?
- Tell her about her future, man.

22:25.636 --> 22:28.674
Tell her about what happens
when she becomes the Black Canary.

22:29.139 --> 22:30.550
LAUREL: <i>Ollie, please help me.</i>

22:31.433 --> 22:32.844
Please, I'm scared.

22:32.935 --> 22:34.426
I don't wanna die.

22:34.937 --> 22:36.769
This is gonna destroy my father.

22:37.314 --> 22:38.475
He can't handle this.

22:38.858 --> 22:39.974
She's got a point.

22:41.861 --> 22:42.942
My question is,

22:43.028 --> 22:46.192
why did you let her become
the Black Canary in the first place?

22:46.615 --> 22:47.981
She's a lawyer!

22:48.075 --> 22:50.067
What, after a couple
of self-defense classes,

22:50.160 --> 22:51.651
and a few sparring sessions with you,

22:51.745 --> 22:54.283
you think she's ready
to go handle thugs and killers?

22:58.002 --> 22:58.992
It was a mistake.

22:59.086 --> 23:00.452
Yeah, your mistake.

23:00.546 --> 23:02.037
Which I had to pay for.

23:02.131 --> 23:03.167
It was a mistake.

23:06.427 --> 23:08.339
But I knew you.

23:08.637 --> 23:13.223
And I knew that you'd
do it with or without me.

23:15.603 --> 23:17.139
I thought this way
I could protect you.

23:17.229 --> 23:19.346
How did that work out for you, Ollie?
Huh?

23:21.442 --> 23:22.478
WILD DOG: Yeah, "Ollie."

23:23.193 --> 23:24.400
How'd that work out for you?

23:24.862 --> 23:26.069
For me, not too good.

23:26.363 --> 23:27.854
Mmm-mmm. I gave you an out.

23:29.408 --> 23:31.070
I told you to stand down.

23:31.368 --> 23:32.734
- Stay down!
- No way!

23:36.457 --> 23:38.164
You know,
John came to see me in here.

23:38.542 --> 23:39.783
Felicity, too.

23:40.336 --> 23:41.543
But you were nowhere, hoss.

23:41.629 --> 23:42.995
He's got a point, Oliver.

23:43.088 --> 23:45.171
If your conscience
is so sparkly clean,

23:45.257 --> 23:46.418
why didn't you check on Rene?

23:46.508 --> 23:48.295
Rene made it clear...

23:48.969 --> 23:51.177
Matter of fact,
all of you have made it clear

23:51.263 --> 23:52.754
that you don't want
anything to do with me.

23:52.848 --> 23:54.339
Always a comeback for everything.

23:54.433 --> 23:55.674
That's enough.

23:57.353 --> 23:58.343
It's not real.

24:05.694 --> 24:06.684
Raisa?

24:10.407 --> 24:12.023
It's not safe here for you.

24:13.285 --> 24:14.366
A man came.

24:14.578 --> 24:16.991
Hey, hey, hey.

24:17.081 --> 24:18.162
Raisa, what man?

24:18.248 --> 24:19.955
With a dragon tattoo.

24:20.501 --> 24:22.333
He wants to hurt you.

24:22.628 --> 24:25.837
I tried to stop him.

24:28.425 --> 24:30.838
DIAZ: Well, the lady wouldn't
go down without a fight.

24:32.221 --> 24:34.053
Your wife and kid aren't here.

24:35.641 --> 24:37.473
They're at some science fair.

24:37.559 --> 24:39.266
Come on, come on, come on.

24:39.853 --> 24:41.810
You still think this isn't real?

24:43.232 --> 24:44.348
(GRUNTS)

24:45.734 --> 24:48.727
Does that feel real enough for you?

24:48.904 --> 24:49.894
Argh!

24:50.280 --> 24:51.612
I always wonder

24:52.074 --> 24:53.815
why nobody just does that.

24:55.035 --> 24:56.742
Kill you straight.

24:57.329 --> 24:59.286
Turns out it'd be a waste of time.

24:59.665 --> 25:01.952
You're more dangerous as a martyr

25:02.459 --> 25:04.325
than you are as Green Arrow.

25:04.920 --> 25:06.786
But before that happens,

25:07.172 --> 25:09.585
there's a lot left of you

25:11.176 --> 25:13.008
that I wanna break.

Yeah, Quentin, hi. I'm gonna
need that hearing delayed.

25:55.512 --> 25:57.629
I'll explain everything.
I'm on my way to City Hall.

25:59.141 --> 26:02.100
You have failed this city.

26:03.771 --> 26:05.888
And you know why.

26:06.690 --> 26:07.976
Because I got away from you.

26:08.442 --> 26:10.900
We were never
supposed to have partners.

26:11.361 --> 26:13.694
There was never
supposed to be a John Diggle,

26:14.156 --> 26:15.988
a Felicity Smoak,

26:16.283 --> 26:18.070
a Team Arrow.

26:18.368 --> 26:21.702
There was never
supposed to be a Green Arrow.

26:21.872 --> 26:24.034
There was only the mission.

26:24.625 --> 26:25.786
I lost sight of that.

26:25.876 --> 26:27.162
You lost your city!

26:28.212 --> 26:31.922
And now, you know what you have to do

26:32.257 --> 26:34.465
to get it back.

26:43.310 --> 26:44.676
It's been over an hour.

26:45.104 --> 26:46.311
Where is the Mayor?

26:46.522 --> 26:49.356
Well, why don't you ask Ricardo Diaz?

26:52.069 --> 26:53.310
Apologies for being late.

26:53.862 --> 26:55.273
Over an hour late.

26:55.489 --> 26:58.607
And we certainly hope you've come
with something worthy of our time.

26:59.660 --> 27:00.650
One minute.

- No.

It's our only card.

27:29.940 --> 27:31.351
Mr. Mayor...

27:31.441 --> 27:33.649
Okay, this flash drive

27:34.695 --> 27:37.278
contains financial data
and correspondence

27:37.948 --> 27:41.191
linking Captain Hill and D.A. Armand

27:41.451 --> 27:44.615
with a known felon
named Ricardo Diaz.

27:44.705 --> 27:46.241
Known by whom?

27:46.331 --> 27:48.493
I've never heard of a Ricardo Diaz.

27:48.709 --> 27:50.792
By design, he's kept
a very low profile.

27:50.961 --> 27:53.044
How did you obtain
this purported evidence

27:53.130 --> 27:56.919
against our former
police captain and district attorney?

28:00.095 --> 28:01.302
The Green Arrow gave it to me.

28:02.639 --> 28:05.006
Or perhaps, you gave it to yourself.

28:05.100 --> 28:06.136
I'm not the Green Arrow.

28:06.226 --> 28:09.640
Not according to the police captain
or D.A. that you fired.

28:09.730 --> 28:12.222
And it also seems rather convenient

28:12.399 --> 28:14.436
that you're not the Green Arrow,

28:14.526 --> 28:18.395
but enjoy a close,
personal relationship with him.

28:20.240 --> 28:21.606
That go down how you expected?

28:24.119 --> 28:27.738
Are you aware we can impeach you
not just for obstruction of justice,

28:27.831 --> 28:30.869
but for perjury
and vigilantism, as well?

28:30.959 --> 28:33.827
Okay, I am so sorry, but something
very urgent has just come in,

28:33.921 --> 28:35.378
and I need to speak
to the Mayor, please.

28:35.464 --> 28:36.454
So, please...

Thank you.

Wait, what's happening.
Are Felicity and William all right?

28:46.892 --> 28:48.884
Listen, the urgent thing was
just a line to buy us some time.

28:48.977 --> 28:50.434
Felicity and William are fine.

28:50.687 --> 28:53.475
Okay? It is you I'm worried about.

28:53.565 --> 28:55.477
Have you still got that
Vertigo crap in your system?

28:58.278 --> 28:59.268
Yeah.

28:59.363 --> 29:02.231
Okay, listen, we need to retreat,
we need to regroup.

29:02.324 --> 29:03.360
Okay? So I'm gonna go back in there

29:03.450 --> 29:05.908
and I'm gonna tell them you've
got a family emergency.

29:06.078 --> 29:07.285
You might not be wrong.

29:08.956 --> 29:11.118
Okay, listen, you need to
go back to your secret lair,

29:11.375 --> 29:13.116
get yourself well.

29:13.377 --> 29:15.084
We'll figure out the next steps.

29:21.176 --> 29:22.417
Sorry, Oliver.

29:23.011 --> 29:24.047
Bad beat.

29:25.722 --> 29:29.056
For what it's worth, I always thought
you were a halfway decent mayor.

29:30.394 --> 29:33.558
Not a great track record when
it comes to hiring D.A.s, though.

29:36.900 --> 29:40.234
This Vertigo is going to be
out of my system eventually.

29:42.614 --> 29:43.821
Then you'll be gone.

29:45.325 --> 29:46.691
Not possible.

29:48.870 --> 29:51.283
I'm not here, remember?

29:54.042 --> 29:55.123
I'm here.

29:55.961 --> 29:57.122
I'm you.

29:59.214 --> 30:00.625
Which is why
you're gonna listen to me

30:00.716 --> 30:02.298
when I tell you what you have to do.

30:03.051 --> 30:05.464
The only way to prove
that you're the hero

30:05.554 --> 30:09.969
that you say you are and keep being
mayor is to take down Diaz, tonight.

30:10.058 --> 30:11.549
No, he's got an army.

30:11.643 --> 30:13.885
You mean all those cops at the SCPD?

30:13.979 --> 30:15.845
I mean that walking
in there is a suicide mission.

30:15.939 --> 30:19.023
That's the risk
a hero takes, isn't it, Oliver?

30:19.443 --> 30:22.982
Diaz is there every night, 10:13 p.m.

30:23.739 --> 30:24.820
Question is,

30:26.283 --> 30:28.024
will you be there to meet him?

30:39.546 --> 30:41.629
Thanks for helping me
put my project back together.

why he lost it on William.

He's on his way to the precinct.

31:50.409 --> 31:52.492

him that Diaz would be there.

36:04.079 --> 36:05.741
It's supposed to help
balance your serotonin levels.

36:05.830 --> 36:08.493
I call it "Felicity's Party
Raver Hangover Supreme Cure."

36:09.292 --> 36:10.783
Though that might be
an insensitive choice of words,

36:10.877 --> 36:12.869
considering what you went through,
but trust me, it works like a charm,

36:12.962 --> 36:14.794
not that I've used it much,
I mean, that was all in the past.

36:14.881 --> 36:16.122
Trust me.

36:16.299 --> 36:17.289
(CLEARS THROAT)

36:18.677 --> 36:19.667
Drugs are bad.

36:19.761 --> 36:22.344
Listen, that was gutsy as hell, you
going into the precinct like that.

36:22.430 --> 36:23.762
Yeah, well, my man was in there.

36:23.848 --> 36:25.384
Yeah, but whatever you said there

36:25.475 --> 36:26.966
could have been caught
on security cameras.

36:27.060 --> 36:28.392
No, Diaz had shut them down.

36:28.812 --> 36:30.144
So, our identities are safe.

36:30.230 --> 36:31.311
(PHONE RINGING)

36:31.439 --> 36:33.226
Irony sold separately.

36:33.566 --> 36:35.683
Excuse me, I gotta take this.
It's the office.

36:37.445 --> 36:38.856
I haven't seen that in a while.

36:39.489 --> 36:41.822
Wanted to take it for a spin down
memory lane or something?

36:41.908 --> 36:43.194
Something like that.

36:43.702 --> 36:45.193
Vertigo gave me some

36:46.538 --> 36:47.528
clarity.

36:47.622 --> 36:49.033
- Sure you're not still high?
- Mmm-hmm.

36:49.833 --> 36:50.949
OLIVER: John had a point.

36:52.085 --> 36:53.826
I've spread myself pretty thin.

36:55.964 --> 36:58.923
I'm not giving up on you,
I'm not giving up on William,

37:00.427 --> 37:03.670
and if by some miracle
I'm not impeached,

37:05.265 --> 37:06.927
I will keep being the mayor.

37:09.978 --> 37:11.970
I believe deeply in the good

37:12.564 --> 37:14.396
that I can do as the Green Arrow.

37:17.569 --> 37:21.313
But I need to bring
the mission back to basics.

37:23.992 --> 37:26.234
I need to bring it back
to where it started.

37:26.453 --> 37:27.739
You mean alone?

37:28.288 --> 37:29.278
Alone.

37:31.332 --> 37:32.539
I'm sorry, guys, I hate to interrupt,

37:32.625 --> 37:34.708
but we have to turn the TV on. News.

37:36.212 --> 37:37.874
<i>In a shocking fall from grace,</i>

37:37.964 --> 37:40.331
<i>the Star City Council
has voted to impeach</i>

37:40.425 --> 37:43.008
<i>Mayor Oliver Queen and
remove him from office.</i>

37:43.470 --> 37:46.133
<i>We now go live to Councilman
Kullens' public statement.</i>

37:46.556 --> 37:49.720
KULLENS: <i>Mr. Queen's affect
at today's inquiry</i>

37:50.143 --> 37:53.682
<i>certainly placed his
fitness for office into question,</i>

37:54.022 --> 37:57.481
<i>but fundamentally,
it was the unilateral firing</i>

37:57.859 --> 38:03.321
<i>of Captain Hill and D.A. Armand
that ultimately sealed his fate.</i>

38:03.907 --> 38:06.695
Sorry, I just couldn't stand to
listen to him any longer.

38:09.496 --> 38:10.737
Okay, listen,
I'm gonna call Jean Loring.

38:10.830 --> 38:12.196
There's gotta be legal
options we can pursue.

38:12.290 --> 38:13.280
No.

38:13.708 --> 38:17.622
I don't want you wasting any more
time or political capital on me.

38:17.712 --> 38:19.453
I don't give a crap
about political capital.

38:19.547 --> 38:20.537
You should.

38:21.633 --> 38:23.090
'Cause you're the mayor now.

38:24.427 --> 38:25.417
(SIGHS)

38:28.431 --> 38:31.139
Thank you so much, Raisa,
for coming on such short notice.

38:31.226 --> 38:33.468
- I'm used to it.
- Thank you, Raisa.

38:33.728 --> 38:34.969
Are you okay, Oliver?

38:35.063 --> 38:36.395
I'll be just fine, thank you.

38:40.652 --> 38:42.644
I know this question
might be questionable, but...

38:43.029 --> 38:44.770
From what it sounded like earlier,

38:46.950 --> 38:48.407
it's like you were firing Overwatch.

38:48.493 --> 38:49.859
I'm not firing anyone.

38:50.829 --> 38:52.070
It's just...

38:52.539 --> 38:53.950
I need to go back

38:54.165 --> 38:56.703
to doing things
like I did when I started.

38:57.669 --> 38:59.126
And that means

39:01.089 --> 39:02.125
doing it alone.

39:03.174 --> 39:04.585
I need to stop Diaz.

39:05.134 --> 39:10.630
And in order to do that, I need
to have a single-minded focus.

39:12.725 --> 39:14.512
I've gotta separate these two worlds.

39:14.686 --> 39:16.518
I just don't think
that's the best possible solution.

39:16.604 --> 39:18.846
OLIVER: I respect your concern,

39:18.940 --> 39:21.227
and I love you very much for it.

39:21.776 --> 39:23.733
We will talk more about this, but

39:24.404 --> 39:25.986
I need to chat with William.

39:26.447 --> 39:27.437
Yeah.

39:36.499 --> 39:37.489
Hey.

39:39.168 --> 39:40.454
I didn't know if you'd be awake.

39:41.379 --> 39:42.620
I can't sleep.

39:43.381 --> 39:45.589
I got a news alert about the impairment.

39:45.675 --> 39:47.041
It's impeachment.

39:48.011 --> 39:49.252
Don't worry, I'll be fine.

39:51.097 --> 39:52.087
I worry about you.

39:54.350 --> 39:56.012
I'm really sorry about before.

39:56.811 --> 39:58.143
I would never

39:59.105 --> 40:02.394
purposefully try to
make you afraid, or...

40:02.483 --> 40:04.315
Felicity said you were
on some sort of drug.

40:04.402 --> 40:05.392
Accidentally.

40:05.778 --> 40:09.943
I was dosed by someone who works
for the man I'm trying to stop.

40:10.116 --> 40:11.277
Ricardo Diaz?

40:13.620 --> 40:14.610
Can you stop him?

40:14.704 --> 40:16.115
I think maybe I found a way.

40:17.040 --> 40:18.326
Most important,

40:18.958 --> 40:21.371
I need to know that
I'm not gonna lose you,

40:22.420 --> 40:24.662
or Felicity ever.

40:24.839 --> 40:26.080
You won't.

40:37.352 --> 40:38.888
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)

40:45.401 --> 40:46.391
Hey.

40:47.779 --> 40:48.769
What are you doing here?

40:48.863 --> 40:51.025
I heard about what happened.
I wanted to see how you were.

40:51.115 --> 40:53.107
Clearly, I should have
brought a broom.

40:53.534 --> 40:54.900
He's spiraling.

40:55.787 --> 40:58.074
That Vertigo worked
even better than I was hoping.

40:58.164 --> 41:00.451
I don't understand why you
don't just put a bullet in him.

41:00.541 --> 41:01.531
Or 20.

41:01.626 --> 41:03.162
'Cause it'd be a waste of time.

41:03.586 --> 41:05.543
He's more dangerous as a martyr

41:06.047 --> 41:07.583
than as the Green Arrow.

41:09.217 --> 41:11.630
I'm gonna dismantle him

41:12.470 --> 41:13.551
piece by piece.

41:13.638 --> 41:14.845
Like with the impeachment?

41:17.684 --> 41:19.596
The impeachment was
just the latest step.

41:22.188 --> 41:23.395
And what's the next one?

41:24.524 --> 41:26.015
We spread the word

41:27.068 --> 41:28.900
that with Mayor Queen out,

41:30.071 --> 41:34.657
Star City, it's open for business.
