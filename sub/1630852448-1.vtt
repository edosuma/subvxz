<i>He's in charge of everything else.</i>

<i>When he sees that cold unpleasant</i>
<i>white stuff out the window</i>

06:55.790 --> 07:00.002

10:48.689 --> 10:53.277

be recharged anymore.

10:53.361 --> 10:55.279
An energy evolution.

10:56.614 --> 11:01.369
It'll also dramatically boost
my current robot project.

11:02.953 --> 11:07.583
A future that Koichi dreamed of
where robots and humans coexist

11:08.292 --> 11:10.378

Riko, who was at the door?

12:01.095 --> 12:02.304
Me.

12:04.390 --> 12:06.100
Ms. Shiraishi…

12:06.183 --> 12:10.855
I brought some documents

12:11.564 --> 12:13.399
The boss called you, right?

12:17.111 --> 12:18.737
Hey, Pete…

12:22.491 --> 12:24.118
Did I scare him?

12:24.785 --> 12:25.995
Sorry.

12:26.787 --> 12:30.124
More like "thanks" to your girlfriend.

12:30.207 --> 12:31.417
Right, Riko?

12:32.126 --> 12:33.419
Maybe…

12:35.087 --> 12:38.174
It's cold today. Let's have hot pot.

12:40.718 --> 12:42.803
Riko is going to cook…

12:42.887 --> 12:45.764
I have packing to do. I'm going home.

Let me help.

13:44.823 --> 13:48.285
It's okay. I see where everything is.

13:48.869 --> 13:53.958
Riko wanted to make sure
I know where things are.

13:54.041 --> 13:57.002
She's moving into a school dorm.

13:57.086 --> 13:58.921
She did all your housework?

14:00.881 --> 14:03.467
She said my time will be
better spent on research.

14:04.260 --> 14:06.011
That's how I completed A-1.

14:16.522 --> 14:18.941
You didn't want Riko to worry?

14:20.442 --> 14:21.777
What?

14:21.861 --> 14:26.949
Are you with me so she won't worry
about you being alone?

14:28.284 --> 14:29.869
No… I…

14:29.952 --> 14:31.662
Do you care about me?

14:33.956 --> 14:34.790
Of course.

14:36.041 --> 14:37.459
More than Riko?

14:41.380 --> 14:42.214
Why compare?

14:47.887 --> 14:49.889
I don't understand.

14:50.598 --> 14:51.849
Huh?

14:54.143 --> 14:57.980
Why are you giving me
a part of your shares?

14:58.063 --> 14:59.273
Oh…

15:00.065 --> 15:03.652
Kazuto and I discussed it
and decided together.

15:03.736 --> 15:09.450
It was mostly his decision, right?
Are you really okay with it?

15:10.117 --> 15:14.038
An accounting secretary is
suddenly an executive.

15:16.123 --> 15:21.587
Honestly, I was surprised but
everybody knows how competent you are.

15:22.963 --> 15:26.592
I don't care about owning stock.

15:26.675 --> 15:30.512
All I want is for you to
focus on your work.

MARCH 8TH, 1995

16:41.166 --> 16:42.001
Come in.

16:44.211 --> 16:45.546
Sorry.

16:45.629 --> 16:47.673
It's okay. I'm done.

16:50.092 --> 16:51.677
Take a seat.

16:55.055 --> 16:58.058
How are you feeling?

16:58.142 --> 17:00.477
Great as long as I have this.

17:01.228 --> 17:03.439
Diabetes sucks.

17:04.106 --> 17:05.566
How are you?

17:06.108 --> 17:11.739
I'm discussing A-1's upgrade specs
and the next model with the mechanics.

17:11.822 --> 17:14.783
Good. Looking forward to it.

17:16.368 --> 17:19.204
What's the urgent meeting about?

17:20.831 --> 17:22.291
Excuse me.

17:32.634 --> 17:36.096
Let's start a special
shareholders' meeting.

17:38.223 --> 17:39.183
Shareholders' meeting?

17:39.266 --> 17:40.934
Shiraishi, the document.

17:41.018 --> 17:44.897
Take the minutes.
The date, March 8th, 1995.

17:46.106 --> 17:47.066
13:00.

17:47.149 --> 17:49.401
New business plan?

17:50.694 --> 17:53.781
Our reputation has grown thanks to A-1.

17:53.864 --> 17:57.826
Our competitors are frantically
trying to catch up to us.

17:57.910 --> 18:02.164
I think we should release A-1
as soon as possible.

18:02.247 --> 18:04.958
Put it out in the market?

18:05.042 --> 18:09.254
To beat our competition.
We'll also expand our business.

18:09.338 --> 18:11.965
No. A-1 isn't ready yet.

18:12.049 --> 18:14.676
I won't approve further development costs.

18:15.636 --> 18:18.222
But the second model…

18:19.306 --> 18:20.682
We need at least a third model…

18:20.766 --> 18:24.520
We'll sell the rights and
gain more capital.

18:24.603 --> 18:28.398
Fortunately, Mannix Enterprises
is making an offer.

18:28.482 --> 18:33.946
Fortunately? I worked too hard on this
to hand it over to someone else.

18:34.029 --> 18:38.117
You can continue your projects
with Mannix.

18:38.200 --> 18:39.368
Is it for money?

18:39.451 --> 18:42.746
Koichi would never allow this!

18:44.957 --> 18:45.791
Mr. Matsushita.

18:46.834 --> 18:50.254
Why don't we vote on the proposal?

18:50.963 --> 18:53.090
Okay, Soichiro?

18:56.885 --> 18:58.470
Yeah. Let's.

19:00.681 --> 19:04.351
Fine. Shiraishi, roll call.

19:04.434 --> 19:06.145
Yes, sir.

19:07.938 --> 19:14.236
Mr. Kazuto Matsushita, do you vote
yes or no to this proposal?

19:16.071 --> 19:17.281
Yes.

19:21.285 --> 19:26.206
Mr. Soichiro Takakura, how about you?

19:27.207 --> 19:28.834
A definite no from me.

19:29.710 --> 19:33.422
And I, Rin Shiraishi, am voting…

19:36.717 --> 19:38.010
Yes.

19:39.678 --> 19:40.721
What?

19:44.391 --> 19:49.646
With two-thirds of the votes in favor
of the proposal, it is adopted.

19:49.730 --> 19:51.857
Wait… Ms. Shiraishi…

19:51.940 --> 19:54.776
It is also decided that

19:54.860 --> 19:57.988
though you will remain a shareholder

19:58.071 --> 20:01.575
you will terminate all your
connections with the company.

20:18.091 --> 20:19.676
Did you guys set me up?

20:19.760 --> 20:23.805
This is an official decision
by the shareholders.

20:23.889 --> 20:27.142
Don't forget the last line.

20:29.895 --> 20:36.401
"As of today, you are forbidden to use
all company facilities and equipment."

22:15.500 --> 22:18.712
Pete, what are you doing in the cold?

22:39.357 --> 22:42.986
Soichiro… What happened?

23:05.217 --> 23:06.051
Are you okay?

23:07.094 --> 23:09.387
-Forget it.
-No.

23:18.480 --> 23:20.357
You're moving tomorrow.

23:24.361 --> 23:25.529
Finished packing?

23:31.201 --> 23:33.829
Who did this to your room?

23:36.748 --> 23:38.667
Uncle Kazuto?

23:48.343 --> 23:49.636
Me.

23:51.721 --> 23:53.348
It's my fault.

23:59.146 --> 24:00.438
You're lying.

24:02.232 --> 24:03.817
Everything was here.

24:04.693 --> 24:08.446
Everything you and Dad created.

24:09.823 --> 24:11.700
You'd never let it go.

24:11.783 --> 24:13.827
This is me!

24:16.746 --> 24:18.582
In the end…

24:20.917 --> 24:24.921
I lose everything that's important to me.

24:37.726 --> 24:39.144
I…

24:42.272 --> 24:44.608
will never go away.

24:47.861 --> 24:49.321
I'll stay here.

24:52.574 --> 24:54.326
I won't move into a dorm.

24:59.247 --> 25:00.832
Don't act like a baby.

25:02.125 --> 25:04.544
I kept it to myself for years!

25:05.587 --> 25:09.883
I thought it was wrong to tell you.
It was tough.

25:15.180 --> 25:16.556
I…

25:18.850 --> 25:20.727
I've always loved you.

25:24.814 --> 25:26.733
I want to be with you forever.

25:35.867 --> 25:39.120
Hey… What can I do?

25:49.422 --> 25:53.635
Nothing. You're just a kid.

26:04.312 --> 26:08.066
You'll know what I mean when you grow up.

26:19.077 --> 26:20.787
Are you giving up?

27:34.444 --> 27:37.739
COLD SLEEP INSURANCE

27:47.999 --> 27:52.087
DREAM YOUR TROUBLES AWAY

27:52.170 --> 27:57.926
<i>Dream your troubles away.</i>
<i>Cold sleep by Credeus.</i>

27:58.551 --> 28:01.805
<i>You can choose the length of cold sleep</i>

28:01.888 --> 28:04.891
<i>from five years to 30 years.</i>

28:04.974 --> 28:09.229
<i>After a medical examination</i>
<i>and legal approval</i>

28:09.312 --> 28:13.400
<i>you can enter cold sleep that same day.</i>

28:13.483 --> 28:18.988
<i>Credeus will invest your assets</i>
<i>as you see fit while you sleep.</i>

28:19.072 --> 28:21.533
Sorry to keep you waiting.

28:21.616 --> 28:23.952
The sleep sanctuary staff says

28:24.035 --> 28:28.498
your friend can use the same capsule.

28:28.581 --> 28:33.545
You'll both enter cold sleep for
the maximum period of 30 years.

28:34.212 --> 28:36.381
Lucky you.

28:36.464 --> 28:39.426
Happy, huh? Together, right?

28:40.176 --> 28:45.014
How fast can we start?

28:45.098 --> 28:47.642
About an hour after approval.

28:48.601 --> 28:50.645
But if you need more time…

28:50.729 --> 28:51.688
No.

28:52.689 --> 28:54.733
As soon as possible.

29:08.705 --> 29:11.207
I'm afraid I can't approve.

29:11.833 --> 29:12.917
Huh?

29:13.752 --> 29:17.213
Your blood alcohol level
is over the limit.

29:19.215 --> 29:22.385
I'm not drunk. I'm totally sober.

29:23.011 --> 29:28.600
I've been working here since
the early days of cold sleep.

29:29.184 --> 29:35.273
Our clients were terminally-ill patients
who hoped for progress in medicine.

29:35.356 --> 29:40.779
Cold sleepers with dreams of
a brighter future.

29:41.821 --> 29:47.744
But now, we get people
looking for a way out of reality.

29:47.827 --> 29:52.916
The more desperate they are,
the more they rush into cold sleep.

29:54.375 --> 29:55.585
Is that wrong?

29:58.129 --> 30:00.507
My point is

30:00.590 --> 30:05.720
you shouldn't let alcohol decide
to take 30 years from your life.

30:13.186 --> 30:17.065
After you sober up,
give it more serious thought.

30:20.652 --> 30:25.573
If not for yourself,
then for someone you care about.

30:27.283 --> 30:28.493
Excuse me.

30:29.744 --> 30:30.787
What?

30:30.870 --> 30:33.164
A re-examination tomorrow at ten.

30:33.248 --> 30:34.249
What?

30:39.170 --> 30:40.255
Damn it.

30:53.685 --> 30:55.687
I thought I'd find you here.

31:01.234 --> 31:03.403
Your parents are worried.

31:05.029 --> 31:06.322
Let's go home.

31:07.031 --> 31:08.575
You go ahead.

31:12.829 --> 31:14.038
Okay.

31:27.927 --> 31:29.345
Soichiro…

32:10.762 --> 32:17.352
ASSIGN SOICHIRO TAKAKURA'S SHARES
TO RIKO MATSUSHITA WHEN SHE TURNS 20

32:17.435 --> 32:21.064
FWE STOCK CERTIFICATE

32:23.983 --> 32:26.736
<i>When Ms. Riko Matsushita</i>

32:26.819 --> 32:29.322
turns 20

32:29.405 --> 32:33.660
you want to assign your shares of
FWE stock to her.

32:34.744 --> 32:40.041
Yes. I want to make sure
it's signed over to her.

32:40.750 --> 32:45.922
We'll have our corporate attorneys
handle the paperwork.

32:47.173 --> 32:50.468
Your boss and his secretary…

32:50.551 --> 32:56.099
If I were you, I'd bash their faces in.

33:48.109 --> 33:49.527
<i>Are you giving up?</i>

34:03.082 --> 34:08.254
No… Running away isn't the solution.

34:39.744 --> 34:44.874
Koichi Matsushita left a troublesome will.

34:45.708 --> 34:49.921
Splitting the company halfway
with the boy he took in.

34:50.463 --> 34:53.591
What does everybody see in Soichiro?

34:56.094 --> 35:01.057
Don't tell me you've fallen for him.

35:03.768 --> 35:05.103
Let's plan our next move.

35:05.978 --> 35:10.775
Even with the A-1 blueprints,
Soichiro is our only engineer.

35:12.235 --> 35:14.612
Don't worry about it.

35:15.238 --> 35:19.283
He has another ace up his sleeve.

35:20.118 --> 35:21.410
What is it?

35:24.163 --> 35:26.624
Plasma battery.

35:30.294 --> 35:35.550
We'll poach engineers from other
companies to complete them.

35:39.262 --> 35:40.930
Any word from the truck?

35:42.140 --> 35:42.974
Not yet.

35:44.142 --> 35:46.394
Trouble at Soichiro's house?

36:08.124 --> 36:09.125
<i>Hello.</i>

36:09.208 --> 36:10.835
<i>-This is Takakura.</i>
-Soichiro?

36:10.918 --> 36:12.378
<i>I'm not home right now.</i>

36:12.461 --> 36:15.756
-It's me. Answer the phone.
<i>-Please leave a message.</i>

36:18.634 --> 36:19.468
Riko.

36:24.849 --> 36:26.058
You're home.

36:26.809 --> 36:31.189
I was talking to a friend.
I'm gonna go see her.

36:48.039 --> 36:50.082
<i>Hello. This is Takakura.</i>

36:50.833 --> 36:52.043
<i>I'm not home right now.</i>

36:58.966 --> 37:01.802
PUBLIC TELEPHONE

37:15.983 --> 37:17.026
Hello?

37:20.613 --> 37:22.323
She came home?

37:22.406 --> 37:25.451
She heard everything.
She went to see Soichiro.

37:25.534 --> 37:28.079
He's on his way here.

37:28.162 --> 37:29.330
He just called.

37:37.088 --> 37:38.464
What are you planning?

37:39.799 --> 37:40.967
Nothing.

37:41.801 --> 37:44.470
Shouldn't you go after Riko?

37:48.349 --> 37:51.269
It's dangerous outside in the dark.

38:08.119 --> 38:09.203
Soichiro…

38:34.603 --> 38:37.189
He went to pick up Riko.

38:40.526 --> 38:43.112
You know your way around this house.

38:45.656 --> 38:47.700
Did you come here to gripe?

38:51.078 --> 38:52.663
I'm seeing a lawyer tomorrow.

38:55.458 --> 39:00.171
Your dismissal and recovery of
research materials are legit.

39:00.254 --> 39:02.923
We haven't breached any laws.

39:03.883 --> 39:08.512
I know. The law isn't on my side.

39:09.889 --> 39:11.390
So what?

39:12.391 --> 39:16.020
I'll disclose everything to the media.

39:17.480 --> 39:22.902
The company's reputation will be ruined
and you'll lose the public's trust.

39:23.736 --> 39:26.864
Will Mannix still want
a business like that?

39:31.243 --> 39:32.078
And?

39:33.120 --> 39:38.459
Renounce the shareholders' meeting
and give back my research materials.

39:45.466 --> 39:46.884
You…

39:48.969 --> 39:50.137
are a badass.

39:51.972 --> 39:52.932
Huh?

39:56.519 --> 39:59.397
I surrender. I accept your terms.

40:06.028 --> 40:07.321
They're back.

40:16.247 --> 40:17.081
Kazuto's.

40:43.607 --> 40:46.777
No… Don't open it…

40:58.080 --> 40:59.331
That hurt!

41:00.708 --> 41:02.084
Stupid cat!

41:02.168 --> 41:03.836
How dare you!

41:09.967 --> 41:11.260
Where did it go?

41:13.929 --> 41:15.389
No…

41:16.557 --> 41:17.391
Pete…

41:18.851 --> 41:19.727
Where did it go?

41:19.810 --> 41:21.270
Run…

41:21.353 --> 41:22.646
Where?

41:22.730 --> 41:24.273
Come here!

41:58.140 --> 41:59.600
Damn…

42:01.393 --> 42:04.939
Who are you working with? A lawyer?

42:10.736 --> 42:11.779
Pete…

42:19.912 --> 42:21.288
Soichiro…

42:44.228 --> 42:46.272
COLD SLEEP APPROVAL

42:47.398 --> 42:48.983
Cold sleep?

43:21.056 --> 43:23.934
Cold sleep, like you wanted.

43:29.064 --> 43:34.612
But not with Credeus. It's being
handled by a Mannix subsidiary.

43:37.031 --> 43:41.410
Before I joined your company,
I worked for Mannix

43:41.493 --> 43:44.246
in the accounting department.

43:44.330 --> 43:49.251
I handled a lot of their tax stuff.

43:51.253 --> 43:54.590
I have people who owe me favors.

43:59.511 --> 44:01.388
Too bad.

44:02.389 --> 44:05.142
Say goodbye to your beloved Riko.

44:08.729 --> 44:11.315
So long, Soichiro.

45:08.330 --> 45:11.208
<i>I lose everything…</i>

45:11.291 --> 45:13.001
<i>Too bad.</i>

45:34.314 --> 45:36.400
Good morning.

45:39.695 --> 45:41.113
Good morning.

45:41.196 --> 45:43.407
Your vocal cord seems fine.

45:43.490 --> 45:46.785
Can you lift your arms and legs?

45:57.921 --> 46:02.509
Good. Your muscles will recover soon.

46:09.808 --> 46:14.813
Don't worry. We have post-cold sleep
rehabilitation programs.

46:26.658 --> 46:28.577
Cold sleep…

46:29.995 --> 46:34.458
It's been 30 years. We're in year 2025.

46:35.709 --> 46:37.336
2025…

46:39.004 --> 46:40.547
FEBRUARY 25, 2025

46:40.631 --> 46:41.590
But you're…

46:41.673 --> 46:46.470
You must be thinking of my father
who was with Credeus.

46:47.095 --> 46:53.018
But wait… You bought your policy
from Mannix Insurance.

46:53.101 --> 46:54.311
Mannix?

46:59.316 --> 47:00.526
Pete…

47:01.944 --> 47:03.570
Where's Pete?

47:03.654 --> 47:05.197
Huh?

47:05.280 --> 47:06.448
Oh…

47:07.574 --> 47:09.243
PETE, come here.

47:20.212 --> 47:21.380
You called?

47:27.344 --> 47:29.930
No… Um…

47:30.847 --> 47:32.391
Pete the cat.

47:33.016 --> 47:34.226
Cat?

47:39.273 --> 47:40.274
Wait…

47:49.324 --> 47:51.702
You need to rest for a few days.

47:53.620 --> 47:58.667
This is PETE, a humanoid nurse
that'll take care of you.

47:58.750 --> 47:59.918
Hello.

48:01.837 --> 48:03.380
Nice to meet you.

48:05.966 --> 48:07.884
Humanoid…

48:10.887 --> 48:14.933
You'll stay hospitalized for
the next five days.

48:15.934 --> 48:21.898
Your physical condition is the same
as it was during your cold sleep

48:21.982 --> 48:27.988
but you must stay in this room
for a 24-hour observation period.

48:28.697 --> 48:30.198
Tonight's recovery meal is…

48:30.282 --> 48:32.200
I'm leaving.

48:33.493 --> 48:35.662
You can in five days.

48:36.330 --> 48:37.581
Tonight's recovery meal is…

48:37.664 --> 48:38.624
My clothes?

48:40.584 --> 48:42.169
Hey…

48:43.378 --> 48:46.173
Would you like meat or fish?

48:47.299 --> 48:49.176
I'm leaving.

48:49.259 --> 48:52.929
You're a humanoid robot, right?
This is a command.

48:56.642 --> 48:57.476
Acknowledged.

48:58.644 --> 49:01.021
I'll go get the person in charge.

49:05.400 --> 49:06.735
What a pain.

49:09.071 --> 49:10.113
Huh?

49:10.614 --> 49:15.661
Mannix Enterprises went bankrupt
during the past 30 years.

49:15.744 --> 49:21.833
I'm afraid you have no home
nor assets to your name.

49:25.045 --> 49:26.922
But rest assured.

49:27.005 --> 49:31.009
The Cold Sleeper Relief Policy
has been enacted.

49:31.093 --> 49:35.013
It's not much but
you'll get some financial aid.

49:37.808 --> 49:39.976
Also…

49:40.060 --> 49:43.480
I only have her address but…

49:43.563 --> 49:49.611
a Riko Matsushita called repeatedly
to inquire about your awakening.

50:07.713 --> 50:11.049
Good morning. I brought your breakfast.

51:41.139 --> 51:43.350
BUS STOP INFORMATION - ROTARY INFORMATION

51:56.780 --> 51:58.156
Taxi?

51:58.740 --> 52:00.784
Yes. But I can't find one…

52:01.993 --> 52:06.414
You must use an online app to call a taxi.

52:07.332 --> 52:08.542
What are you doing here?

52:09.292 --> 52:11.419
Please be more courteous.

52:11.503 --> 52:12.712
Nice to meet you.

52:13.463 --> 52:17.175
Why "nice to meet you"? What's going on?

52:17.259 --> 52:18.385
It's here.

52:21.304 --> 52:22.264
Hey…

52:22.347 --> 52:24.599
AVAILABLE

52:24.683 --> 52:25.767
ON-BOARD

52:26.476 --> 52:28.603
Let me show you how it works.

52:29.604 --> 52:32.941
Destination, Old District Seven,
West 2-15.

52:33.024 --> 52:36.319
-Get off. Get off!
<i>-Searching destination.</i>

52:36.403 --> 52:38.655
<i>-The fare is…</i>
-Driver, don't…

52:38.738 --> 52:40.156
<i>1,620 yen.</i>

52:43.535 --> 52:46.496
There's no driver. It's fully automatic.

52:47.706 --> 52:50.876
It's just us two in the car.

52:53.879 --> 52:55.672
Get out of the car.

52:56.882 --> 53:00.635
I decline the command. I finally escaped.

53:01.761 --> 53:03.013
Huh?

53:03.096 --> 53:05.849
I'm apparently defective.

53:05.932 --> 53:12.188
An "explore" function overload.
The equivalent to "curiosity" in humans.

53:14.024 --> 53:17.277
But why come to me?

53:17.360 --> 53:19.613
I understand you design robots.

53:19.696 --> 53:23.074
If anything happens to me, you can fix me.

53:23.158 --> 53:26.786
I don't have the skills.
They're 30 years old.

53:28.079 --> 53:31.124
Then we'll study together.

53:31.207 --> 53:33.126
First, modern society.

53:34.336 --> 53:36.254
Wallet, please.

53:38.465 --> 53:40.550
Wallet, please.

53:53.647 --> 53:55.106
Hey!

53:55.190 --> 53:58.443
Cash, paper or coins, are not used.

53:59.110 --> 54:02.572
Gold is also worthless.
It's plain garbage.

54:03.198 --> 54:05.992
You can use this as a wallet.

54:06.701 --> 54:08.662
Your subsidies are in your account.

54:11.164 --> 54:12.540
This is a wallet?

54:28.932 --> 54:32.185
<i>What is Riko Matsushita's address?</i>

54:32.268 --> 54:33.520
We're here.

54:34.813 --> 54:35.897
Are we?

54:39.192 --> 54:40.318
Maybe.

54:41.361 --> 54:43.530
Let's check.

54:44.447 --> 54:45.991
Wait a sec.

54:46.783 --> 54:48.368
You're not coming?

54:49.869 --> 54:50.954
I am.

54:51.913 --> 54:54.332
But don't follow me.

54:55.041 --> 54:57.252
One moment, sir.

54:57.335 --> 54:59.295
Don't call me sir.

54:59.379 --> 55:01.089
One moment, dude.

55:02.090 --> 55:03.425
That's worse.

55:03.508 --> 55:06.469
And don't call me a pain either.

55:46.593 --> 55:47.719
Riko?

56:19.959 --> 56:23.463
I've been waiting for you.

56:34.140 --> 56:37.102
Ms. Shiraishi?

56:39.521 --> 56:43.858
I knew you wouldn't answer my calls
if I said it was me.

56:44.609 --> 56:48.571
Come on. Don't just stand there.

56:54.410 --> 56:56.079
Want some?

57:00.625 --> 57:02.836
I'm still eating that.

57:07.382 --> 57:08.800
What happened to you?

57:08.883 --> 57:12.804
Nothing worth mentioning.

57:13.596 --> 57:17.100
The year after you went into hibernation

57:17.767 --> 57:21.020
Kazuto got sick and died.

57:22.439 --> 57:23.565
He did?

57:23.648 --> 57:26.443
A complication from diabetes.

57:26.526 --> 57:28.820
Blood vessels in the brain…

57:29.821 --> 57:33.366
Then the company was taken over.

57:33.992 --> 57:38.580
I was caught evading taxes for Mannix.

57:38.663 --> 57:40.123
I did time in prison.

57:40.206 --> 57:42.083
Stop. Enough.

57:43.209 --> 57:44.627
Where's Riko?

57:45.545 --> 57:46.379
Where is she?

57:46.463 --> 57:49.007
I know you planned it!

57:50.049 --> 57:51.968
You got me locked up!

57:54.345 --> 57:58.224
You froze me in sleep for 30 years!

57:58.308 --> 58:01.102
What about your shares!

58:01.186 --> 58:05.315
Why does that man have them?

58:05.398 --> 58:06.357
That man?

58:06.441 --> 58:10.153
They were supposed to be mine.

58:10.987 --> 58:16.576
But he suddenly showed up
and ruined my plan!

58:17.243 --> 58:20.955
Who's this man? Where's Riko?

58:21.581 --> 58:25.293
The truck never came back.

58:26.503 --> 58:29.214
Oh yeah…

58:30.423 --> 58:34.135
It must have burned
at the house with Riko.

58:35.512 --> 58:36.513
Burned?

58:37.430 --> 58:40.475
The day you entered cold sleep.

58:42.018 --> 58:47.190
She ran to you. To her beloved Soichiro.

58:47.899 --> 58:52.987
<i>But you came to Kazuto's house.</i>
<i>Kazuto went after her.</i>

58:53.071 --> 58:56.366
Boom!

58:57.450 --> 59:02.121
Your house exploded right in front of him.

59:03.581 --> 59:08.795
She's been missing ever since.
You know what that means.

59:44.706 --> 59:47.709
<i>You never give up.</i>

59:47.792 --> 59:50.795
Riko, research is…

1:00:01.764 --> 1:00:05.226
Not a failure if you don't give up. Right?

1:01:12.460 --> 1:01:15.088
A song from 1993.

1:01:17.840 --> 1:01:19.425
Riko's favorite.

1:01:30.728 --> 1:01:31.938
I…

1:01:33.940 --> 1:01:36.275
just wanted to apologize.

1:01:39.862 --> 1:01:40.863
But…

1:01:56.462 --> 1:01:58.715
I have to find out.

1:02:00.466 --> 1:02:03.010
About the man Shiraishi mentioned.

1:02:03.678 --> 1:02:06.305
Why he had my stock certificate.

1:02:10.351 --> 1:02:13.688
Why Riko passed away.

1:02:18.484 --> 1:02:20.069
Soichiro…

1:02:22.155 --> 1:02:27.326
Would Pete be happy if there was
no winter and only summer?

1:02:30.455 --> 1:02:31.873
I'm sure he would be.

1:02:33.875 --> 1:02:35.418
You think so?

1:02:36.043 --> 1:02:37.253
Yeah.

1:02:37.336 --> 1:02:41.716
If there was only summer,
he might look for the door to winter.

1:02:45.970 --> 1:02:47.889
I think Pete's like that.

1:02:48.973 --> 1:02:51.058
He takes after his owner.

1:02:52.185 --> 1:02:53.352
See?

1:02:53.978 --> 1:02:55.062
Same face.

1:03:07.033 --> 1:03:08.743
I'll look for the door.

1:03:11.662 --> 1:03:12.872
Door?

1:03:15.875 --> 1:03:18.544
Will you help me?

1:03:20.338 --> 1:03:24.675
I've been commanded
to serve you for five days.

1:03:25.468 --> 1:03:28.012
We have four more days.

1:03:30.515 --> 1:03:33.351
Is your program working properly?

1:03:37.980 --> 1:03:39.315
Let's go.

1:03:54.747 --> 1:03:58.501
Was the man with your stock
involved in Riko's death?

1:03:59.335 --> 1:04:04.382
It was supposed to go to Riko.
We have to find out who he is.

1:04:05.800 --> 1:04:08.010
COMPANY HISTORY: 1970 - 1979

1:04:08.094 --> 1:04:09.512
Here it is.

1:04:09.595 --> 1:04:12.765
LISTED IN FIRST SECTION OF
TOKYO STOCK EXCHANGE

1:04:12.849 --> 1:04:16.644
FWE was acquired by
Guardian Manufacturing.

1:04:19.730 --> 1:04:22.900
Hardly any prior stock info.

1:04:28.239 --> 1:04:31.576
<i>GLASS MASK</i>

1:04:32.410 --> 1:04:33.369
Malfunction.

1:04:34.829 --> 1:04:37.582
I'm fine. It's how humans laugh.

1:04:37.665 --> 1:04:39.333
AHA-HA-HA-HA

1:04:40.710 --> 1:04:42.044
Stop it.

1:04:44.422 --> 1:04:48.092
I see. The purple roses man is…

1:04:50.303 --> 1:04:51.846
It's time.

1:04:53.180 --> 1:04:54.181
What?

1:04:55.057 --> 1:04:59.353
I enter sleep mode for three hours a day.

1:04:59.437 --> 1:05:02.648
My program is reconfigured with new data…

1:05:02.732 --> 1:05:03.566
Right.

1:05:05.109 --> 1:05:10.239
Information is fed through here.
Laser sensor? Infrared?

1:05:10.323 --> 1:05:13.075
What about power? Rechargeable?

1:05:14.201 --> 1:05:17.747
Self-regenerative energy
that lasts semi-permanently.

1:05:19.248 --> 1:05:21.876
Semi-permanently…

1:05:23.210 --> 1:05:24.337
Is it…?

1:05:24.962 --> 1:05:27.089
Take off your shirt.

1:05:27.173 --> 1:05:28.674
As you wish.

1:05:39.185 --> 1:05:41.729
Plasma battery.

1:05:49.445 --> 1:05:51.030
So you're FWE's…

1:05:51.113 --> 1:05:54.700
No. The humanoid robot market

1:05:54.784 --> 1:05:59.664
is dominated by FWE & Guardian
and Aladdin Industry.

1:05:59.747 --> 1:06:02.583
I'm an Aladdin product.

1:06:03.793 --> 1:06:05.544
PETE-13…

1:06:17.473 --> 1:06:21.602
I want information on
any former shareholder.

1:06:21.686 --> 1:06:28.442
I'm sorry. You must have
an appointment to enter the offices.

1:06:28.526 --> 1:06:30.945
Then make me an appointment.

1:06:31.612 --> 1:06:33.572
I'm sorry.

1:06:33.656 --> 1:06:39.078
I can't do that here.
Please contact the person in charge.

1:06:39.161 --> 1:06:44.917
I'm Soichiro Takakura.
I invented A-1 and used to work here.

1:06:45.001 --> 1:06:46.502
Who's the person in charge?

1:06:46.585 --> 1:06:51.090
I'll have to scan your retina
for identification.

1:06:51.173 --> 1:06:52.591
Retina?

1:06:53.801 --> 1:06:56.470
Look at this light.

1:07:03.644 --> 1:07:08.733
I'm an Aladdin. Are you a Guardian?

1:07:13.612 --> 1:07:15.698
Do you have time later?

1:07:18.743 --> 1:07:21.245
I decline that command.

1:07:22.204 --> 1:07:25.750
Please make another one.

1:07:28.627 --> 1:07:34.175
You're not registered.
Please come back after you…

1:07:39.555 --> 1:07:40.556
What?

1:07:44.810 --> 1:07:49.065
I'm sorry.
I'll show you to the president's office.

1:08:21.889 --> 1:08:23.349
Mr. Takakura!

1:08:26.727 --> 1:08:30.439
It's been so long! I'm Gota Tsuboi!

1:08:33.400 --> 1:08:34.860
This is my company.

1:08:35.945 --> 1:08:37.071
GOTA TSUBOI, COMPANY PRESIDENT

1:08:37.154 --> 1:08:39.156
You're the president?

1:08:39.240 --> 1:08:40.282
Yes.

1:08:41.033 --> 1:08:42.701
Have we met before?

1:08:43.661 --> 1:08:44.495
What?

1:08:45.329 --> 1:08:47.665
-What?
-What?

1:08:48.958 --> 1:08:52.545
I'll find out what I can
about the shareholders.

1:08:52.628 --> 1:08:53.504
Thank you.

1:08:54.839 --> 1:08:58.717
I can't believe you were in cold sleep.

1:08:59.385 --> 1:09:04.181
I was inspired by you
to start designing robots.

1:09:05.391 --> 1:09:11.522
I was so moved when I first saw him.

1:09:19.488 --> 1:09:23.242
You even put the plasma battery
to practical use.

1:09:23.325 --> 1:09:26.453
You're a god. Yes, you are!

1:09:26.537 --> 1:09:27.454
Huh?

1:09:27.538 --> 1:09:31.792
Why did you give
exclusive rights to Aladdin?

1:09:33.002 --> 1:09:35.588
Me? The plasma battery?

1:09:37.339 --> 1:09:38.382
To Aladdin?

1:09:41.760 --> 1:09:42.970
Mr. Takakura.

1:09:44.096 --> 1:09:49.310
You really don't remember me?

1:09:51.020 --> 1:09:51.896
No…

1:09:51.979 --> 1:09:55.858
Of course not. No problem.

1:09:55.941 --> 1:10:00.196
You look the same but
I was in grade school back then.

1:10:01.280 --> 1:10:02.573
Grade school?

1:10:02.656 --> 1:10:07.536
You came to Tsuboi,
a restaurant that my family runs.

1:10:08.162 --> 1:10:14.501
You were on TV and my dad was thrilled
that a celebrity had come.

1:10:17.796 --> 1:10:19.173
My treasure.

1:10:20.966 --> 1:10:22.051
Wait…

1:10:22.885 --> 1:10:28.682
You said to me
"You'll be a great inventor one day."

1:10:36.690 --> 1:10:39.693
I signed this book?

1:10:41.278 --> 1:10:43.489
You came to see Professor Toi.

1:10:44.156 --> 1:10:45.032
Professor Toi?

1:10:45.115 --> 1:10:48.619
He was a regular customer.

1:10:48.702 --> 1:10:54.708
He was arrested for embezzling
research funds from the university.

<i>Of course not. You're a layman.</i>

I hadn't completed the plasma battery
and had never heard of Aladdin.

1:12:18.917 --> 1:12:21.420
Someone must be using my identity.

1:12:23.005 --> 1:12:26.300
A mastermind behind the scenes?

1:12:33.057 --> 1:12:34.516
How do I do this?

1:15:44.122 --> 1:15:48.252
Hello! Is Professor Toi here?!

1:15:49.711 --> 1:15:52.130
Does someone actually live here?

1:15:56.260 --> 1:15:57.678
Professor Toi!

1:15:57.761 --> 1:15:59.429
<i>Who is it?</i>

1:16:00.305 --> 1:16:03.725
Sorry to disturb you.
I'm Soichiro Takakura…

1:16:11.066 --> 1:16:12.609
Excuse me…

1:16:14.236 --> 1:16:15.696
You're late! Come in!

1:16:15.779 --> 1:16:16.989
Hey…

1:16:38.885 --> 1:16:41.597
All right. Onto the platform.

1:16:41.680 --> 1:16:43.015
Wait a second…

1:16:43.098 --> 1:16:46.852
No. I'm done waiting.
I waited for you for 30 years.

1:16:47.936 --> 1:16:51.315
So… the time transfer machine…

1:16:51.398 --> 1:16:55.986
Yes. I completed it.
Perfectly and flawlessly.

1:16:56.069 --> 1:17:00.407
Your presence here today is proof.

1:17:01.491 --> 1:17:05.495
Then send me back.

1:17:06.538 --> 1:17:07.706
Wait.

1:17:07.789 --> 1:17:09.249
I said I'm done waiting.

1:17:09.875 --> 1:17:13.295
In spite of my intelligence,
I don't understand.

1:17:13.378 --> 1:17:16.131
Why is Soichiro the proof?

1:17:19.051 --> 1:17:23.180
I had Professor Toi build this machine.

1:17:24.097 --> 1:17:27.643
You had him build it?

1:17:29.186 --> 1:17:32.689
So the mastermind is…

1:17:35.233 --> 1:17:36.777
Yes.

1:17:37.903 --> 1:17:39.071
Me.

1:17:41.281 --> 1:17:45.577
We're now in a re-written future.

1:17:47.162 --> 1:17:49.498
A re-written future…

1:17:49.581 --> 1:17:50.707
That's right.

1:17:50.791 --> 1:17:54.461
Theoretically, time runs in a single axis.

1:17:54.544 --> 1:17:56.838
Parallel worlds don't exist.

1:17:56.922 --> 1:17:59.007
In other words, it loops.

1:18:00.467 --> 1:18:01.968
Hey, robot.

1:18:14.147 --> 1:18:16.733
Strap these onto his body.

1:18:16.817 --> 1:18:21.363
Sell this gold in the past and
fund my research with it.

1:18:21.446 --> 1:18:24.908
Produce whatever the project requires.

1:18:29.204 --> 1:18:31.248
It needs energy.

1:18:33.458 --> 1:18:34.876
Plasma battery.

1:18:36.128 --> 1:18:38.588
You must succeed.

1:18:44.136 --> 1:18:46.930
Ten to the 32nd power…

1:18:52.060 --> 1:18:56.732
It might work in theory
but it's still too dangerous.

1:18:57.733 --> 1:18:59.693
You shouldn't do this.

1:18:59.776 --> 1:19:01.153
I know.

1:19:02.696 --> 1:19:04.156
But I'm going anyway.

1:19:05.323 --> 1:19:06.616
If I can save Riko.

1:19:07.576 --> 1:19:12.247
But keep your stay as short as possible.

1:19:12.330 --> 1:19:15.250
Don't contact people unless necessary.

1:19:15.959 --> 1:19:16.835
Okay.

1:19:16.918 --> 1:19:18.503
You must come back

1:19:18.587 --> 1:19:24.760
as you are now to this day 30 years later.

1:19:25.385 --> 1:19:28.680
So? What are you going to do?

1:19:32.476 --> 1:19:34.936
I'll enter cold sleep again.

1:19:40.567 --> 1:19:43.403
This is the 4th day of my service.

1:19:44.362 --> 1:19:49.367
There's a day left but
it seems like I'm relieved of my duties.

1:19:51.411 --> 1:19:55.165
Yeah. You're free now.

1:19:59.002 --> 1:20:02.214
Hold on to this for me.

1:20:16.812 --> 1:20:17.854
Thanks.

1:20:19.815 --> 1:20:20.774
PETE.

1:20:22.776 --> 1:20:24.903
I'm glad we met.

1:20:35.539 --> 1:20:39.543
Transfer back to this day 30 years ago.
February 28.

1:20:40.335 --> 1:20:43.922
Don't move no matter what happens.

1:20:44.881 --> 1:20:45.924
Okay.

1:20:48.260 --> 1:20:49.678
Here we go.

1:21:02.649 --> 1:21:04.568
We're close. Hang in there!

1:21:53.825 --> 1:21:55.076
Yes!

1:22:02.667 --> 1:22:05.128
<i>That's it for tonight.</i>

1:22:05.211 --> 1:22:09.966
<i>A special program, Night Scope,</i>
<i>hosted by Yuji Nakajima.</i>

1:22:10.050 --> 1:22:12.719
<i>The title of this program…</i>

1:22:31.988 --> 1:22:33.073
Soichiro.

1:22:33.782 --> 1:22:35.450
Soichiro.

1:22:36.117 --> 1:22:37.369
Soichiro.

1:22:38.203 --> 1:22:39.204
Hey.

1:22:41.247 --> 1:22:43.458
What are you doing?

1:23:01.393 --> 1:23:02.644
You're awake.

1:23:06.523 --> 1:23:07.649
You…

1:23:07.732 --> 1:23:10.986
It's February 28, 1995.

1:23:12.487 --> 1:23:13.822
1995…

1:23:13.905 --> 1:23:15.365
FEBRUARY 28, 1995

1:23:15.448 --> 1:23:18.076
You transferred back 30 years in time.

1:23:18.159 --> 1:23:22.288
You're Soichiro Takakura,
the FWE inventor of A-1.

1:23:22.872 --> 1:23:26.042
I cashed the gold you brought back.

1:23:26.126 --> 1:23:27.293
It's in here.

1:23:28.336 --> 1:23:33.383
All necessary research materials
are in a room upstairs.

1:23:34.342 --> 1:23:36.803
When's your next cold sleep?

1:23:38.263 --> 1:23:40.724
Uh… March 8th.

1:23:40.807 --> 1:23:44.561
No. 10:00 a.m. on March 9th at Credeus.

1:23:45.562 --> 1:23:48.064
Room fee for nine days.

1:23:48.148 --> 1:23:52.444
The cost of research and room fee will
be deducted

1:23:52.527 --> 1:23:55.155
from the gold proceeds.

1:23:55.238 --> 1:24:00.952
I'm charging you 20% of the balance
for legal counsel and services.

1:24:01.036 --> 1:24:05.165
As Taro Sato,
your lawyer and patent attorney.

1:24:05.248 --> 1:24:07.542
LAWYER TARO SATO

1:24:11.463 --> 1:24:12.922
You're Taro Sato?

1:24:14.257 --> 1:24:16.676
He told me everything.

1:24:20.805 --> 1:24:22.432
PETE…

1:24:25.018 --> 1:24:28.188
If everything looks good, sign that.

1:24:28.271 --> 1:24:31.149
I accept it as a business deal.

1:24:36.821 --> 1:24:41.534
PETE laughed when I introduced myself.
He laughs weird.

1:24:41.618 --> 1:24:43.578
I looked for you in the future.

1:24:43.661 --> 1:24:45.413
So I heard.

1:24:45.497 --> 1:24:50.460
Although I'm not 100% convinced,
he showed me the device on his back.

1:24:52.045 --> 1:24:58.134
And Midori loves the thought
that you guys are from the future.

1:25:12.232 --> 1:25:13.983
<i>Sorry for putting you in danger.</i>

1:25:14.734 --> 1:25:16.945
Why are you apologizing?

1:25:17.946 --> 1:25:21.866
You had to time transfer because of me.

1:25:24.035 --> 1:25:25.912
I feel bad.

1:25:26.913 --> 1:25:29.124
Don't you realize?

1:25:30.750 --> 1:25:31.626
Huh?

1:25:34.045 --> 1:25:35.046
Forget it.

1:25:37.090 --> 1:25:42.679
I was to serve you for another day.
No need for an apology.

1:25:42.762 --> 1:25:47.142
You can't go back to the future
with cold sleep.

1:25:47.225 --> 1:25:51.938
I'll just set my sleep mode
to 30 years. No problem.

1:25:54.023 --> 1:25:57.110
More importantly, do you have enough time?

1:26:00.905 --> 1:26:04.784
I was almost finished with
the plasma battery blueprint.

1:26:04.868 --> 1:26:09.205
I'll upgrade the second model
of A-1 to design PETE.

1:26:12.709 --> 1:26:16.504
And I'm going to save Riko.

1:26:25.346 --> 1:26:29.559
<i>The atmospheric pressure from the north</i>

1:26:29.642 --> 1:26:32.770
<i>is causing snowfall in the region.</i>

1:26:32.854 --> 1:26:33.813
MARCH 1ST, 1995

1:26:33.897 --> 1:26:39.110
<i>The temperature will remain low</i>
<i>throughout the night and…</i>

1:26:39.194 --> 1:26:40.361
MARCH 8TH: THE DAY!

1:26:40.445 --> 1:26:43.406
<i>March 8th is the day</i>
<i>I'll carry out the plan.</i>

1:26:43.489 --> 1:26:47.869
<i>I have to finish designing PETE</i>
<i>and the plasma battery by then.</i>

1:26:49.245 --> 1:26:53.333
<i>But first, I'm going to go</i>
<i>see that man today.</i>

1:26:54.876 --> 1:26:55.877
RESTAURANT TSUBOI

1:26:55.960 --> 1:26:57.462
Thank you!

1:27:01.925 --> 1:27:02.967
Hello.

1:27:05.428 --> 1:27:06.471
Hello.

1:27:11.309 --> 1:27:12.477
Hello.

1:27:19.108 --> 1:27:20.777
Take any seat.

1:27:32.914 --> 1:27:34.290
What can I get you?

1:27:35.166 --> 1:27:36.167
I'll…

1:27:37.335 --> 1:27:39.128
have what he's having.

1:27:39.629 --> 1:27:40.672
Sure.

1:27:45.260 --> 1:27:47.637
You're creeping me out.

1:27:47.720 --> 1:27:51.182
I wanted the same drink, Professor Toi.

1:27:53.184 --> 1:27:55.812
I have nothing to say to the media.

1:27:55.895 --> 1:27:58.106
I'm not a reporter. I…

1:27:59.190 --> 1:28:02.193
came back to this era

1:28:02.277 --> 1:28:06.114
from 30 years in the future
on your time transfer machine.

1:28:08.241 --> 1:28:12.829
Nonsense. I quit my research.

1:28:16.249 --> 1:28:17.834
Your research fund.

1:28:19.043 --> 1:28:20.420
Take it.

1:28:28.720 --> 1:28:31.014
I can't accept this from a stranger!

1:28:33.016 --> 1:28:34.267
Hey.

1:28:34.350 --> 1:28:36.686
You're on TV.

1:28:37.562 --> 1:28:40.898
Are you someone famous?

1:28:42.650 --> 1:28:45.778
<i>Takakura joined FWE after…</i>

1:28:50.325 --> 1:28:53.494
I'm a fledgling inventor.

1:28:53.578 --> 1:28:58.958
I understand why you embezzled money
to continue your research.

1:29:00.626 --> 1:29:03.546
You got fired. You have time to spare.

1:29:03.629 --> 1:29:05.048
Gota!

1:29:05.131 --> 1:29:09.260
It says in this book that
nothing is born from denial.

1:29:12.430 --> 1:29:18.227
Don't worry about this money.
I promise your research will succeed.

1:29:28.363 --> 1:29:29.197
For the check.

1:29:36.287 --> 1:29:38.331
I'll go get a nice meal.

1:29:42.960 --> 1:29:46.422
Are you really letting him
take your money?

1:29:47.465 --> 1:29:48.591
Yes.

1:29:49.717 --> 1:29:52.178
Can I have your autograph?

1:29:52.261 --> 1:29:55.348
I want to make robots when I grow up.

1:29:56.432 --> 1:29:57.558
Okay.

1:30:07.193 --> 1:30:08.319
Here.

1:30:10.655 --> 1:30:11.864
Gota.

1:30:12.448 --> 1:30:15.868
You'll be a great inventor one day.

1:30:17.787 --> 1:30:19.038
Don't give up.

1:30:39.308 --> 1:30:40.518
Yes?

1:30:42.145 --> 1:30:43.396
Take a break.

1:30:49.443 --> 1:30:51.320
-Here.
-Thank you.

1:30:56.826 --> 1:30:58.286
Is he sleeping?

1:30:59.704 --> 1:31:01.122
He's in sleep mode.

1:31:01.581 --> 1:31:05.001
The three hours of day that
he stops talking.

1:31:07.170 --> 1:31:12.466
I like how he's so talkative.
Midori also enjoys his company.

1:31:16.387 --> 1:31:19.891
What happened to Midori?

1:31:23.311 --> 1:31:25.438
A traffic accident two years ago.

1:31:26.564 --> 1:31:32.862
Before that, she used to compete in
three triathlon matches a year.

1:31:33.863 --> 1:31:40.536
She's still cheerful but
she doesn't go out or talk as much.

1:31:42.205 --> 1:31:47.001
But ever since you guys showed up,
she's like the old Midori again.

1:31:49.503 --> 1:31:50.963
Not us.

1:31:52.465 --> 1:31:54.175
Just PETE.

1:32:03.351 --> 1:32:04.685
Why "PETE"?

1:32:10.441 --> 1:32:13.611
I had a cat, a sidekick named Pete.

1:32:14.737 --> 1:32:16.405
<i>He loved summer.</i>

1:32:16.489 --> 1:32:21.744
He kept looking for it. He never gave up.

1:32:25.915 --> 1:32:28.459
Just like you from the future.

1:32:38.970 --> 1:32:40.304
Mr. Sato.

1:32:43.099 --> 1:32:45.977
May I make another request?

1:33:06.497 --> 1:33:07.873
What is it?

1:33:11.585 --> 1:33:13.921
<i>Check their tax records.</i>

1:33:14.005 --> 1:33:16.424
Expose them for tax evasion.

1:33:17.508 --> 1:33:20.720
The woman's name is Rin Shiraishi.

1:33:21.470 --> 1:33:25.016
You'll crush the great Mannix Enterprises.

1:33:25.099 --> 1:33:27.059
Yes. That's the point.

1:33:29.270 --> 1:33:33.566
Also the patent applications
for PETE and the plasma battery.

1:33:33.649 --> 1:33:37.069
Set up a new company for that.

1:33:40.072 --> 1:33:43.701
I'll do it.
But can you pay for my services?

1:33:45.369 --> 1:33:48.664
What would you name the company?

1:33:48.748 --> 1:33:50.124
Me?

1:33:50.916 --> 1:33:52.376
Let's see…

1:33:54.920 --> 1:33:56.088
How about Aladdin?

1:33:59.633 --> 1:34:04.180
Your compensation will be
shares of FWE stock

1:34:04.263 --> 1:34:07.350
and the presidency of Aladdin Industry.

1:34:07.433 --> 1:34:08.559
President?

1:34:12.897 --> 1:34:14.357
Me?

1:34:19.862 --> 1:34:21.322
Fine.

1:34:21.864 --> 1:34:27.119
One more thing.
This is the most important.

1:34:31.874 --> 1:34:37.213
Midori, do you still want a family?

1:34:40.299 --> 1:34:44.136
It's something I stopped wishing for.

1:34:46.931 --> 1:34:48.516
What if it were to come true?

1:34:51.811 --> 1:34:54.688
I couldn't be any happier.

1:35:30.516 --> 1:35:34.103
It's March 8th.
We're carrying out the plan tonight.

1:35:34.186 --> 1:35:35.771
When do we leave?

1:35:35.855 --> 1:35:39.442
It's at least two hours to your house.

1:35:39.525 --> 1:35:45.322
We had to leave before 11
to load the truck and escape.

1:35:47.867 --> 1:35:49.243
An hour ago.

1:35:49.326 --> 1:35:50.703
We won't make it!

1:35:50.786 --> 1:35:52.246
Don't worry.

1:35:53.706 --> 1:36:00.004
I'm a humanoid robot from 2025
with state-of-the-art technology.

1:36:00.963 --> 1:36:02.339
Nothing is impossible.

1:36:14.310 --> 1:36:15.352
<i>Let's start</i>

1:36:15.436 --> 1:36:17.730
a special shareholders' meeting.

1:36:17.813 --> 1:36:20.941
The date, March 8th, 1995.

1:36:22.276 --> 1:36:23.694
13:00.

1:36:35.748 --> 1:36:37.333
Did you guys set me up?

1:36:37.416 --> 1:36:39.376
This is an official decision.

1:37:18.457 --> 1:37:20.000
Stop!

1:37:26.465 --> 1:37:28.968
Let's get out of here!

1:37:32.388 --> 1:37:33.556
I got you.

1:37:43.482 --> 1:37:44.483
I'm done.

1:38:25.357 --> 1:38:26.984
That hurt!

1:38:29.236 --> 1:38:30.404
Stupid cat!

1:38:37.369 --> 1:38:38.537
Where did it go?

1:38:41.582 --> 1:38:43.000
How dare you!

1:38:44.293 --> 1:38:45.669
Come here!

1:38:57.514 --> 1:38:59.016
Pete!

1:39:11.236 --> 1:39:13.822
Good boy. Everything's okay.

1:39:27.711 --> 1:39:29.046
Soichiro…

1:39:45.437 --> 1:39:46.522
Riko…

1:39:51.235 --> 1:39:52.403
Soichiro…

1:40:01.954 --> 1:40:03.539
Sorry about earlier.

1:40:13.257 --> 1:40:14.383
No.

1:40:17.428 --> 1:40:18.512
I'm sorry too.

1:40:29.356 --> 1:40:30.357
Soichiro.

1:40:31.108 --> 1:40:33.110
Let's go. Kazuto is coming.

1:40:42.828 --> 1:40:44.079
Keep her safe.

1:40:44.163 --> 1:40:45.372
Certainly.

1:40:45.956 --> 1:40:47.166
I'll be right back.

1:40:51.628 --> 1:40:52.838
Soichiro…

1:40:58.510 --> 1:40:59.970
Who are you?

1:41:01.054 --> 1:41:03.390
Soichiro's child.

1:41:58.821 --> 1:42:04.451
POWER OF ATTORNEY OVER
THE ASSIGNMENT OF STOCK SHARES

1:43:13.478 --> 1:43:14.646
Are you okay?

1:43:14.730 --> 1:43:16.356
Yeah. Let's hurry.

1:43:21.403 --> 1:43:22.988
The house…

1:43:23.071 --> 1:43:24.281
I did it.

1:43:24.364 --> 1:43:27.242
Why? You'll lose everything.

1:43:28.952 --> 1:43:30.037
Riko.

1:43:31.038 --> 1:43:32.456
Look forward.

1:43:33.498 --> 1:43:34.750
If you're gonna look back…

1:43:37.294 --> 1:43:38.837
just look at this.

1:43:58.482 --> 1:44:03.654
<i>I'm going to tell you about the future.</i>
<i>Stay calm and listen.</i>

1:44:26.969 --> 1:44:30.555
Nice to meet you. I'm Midori.

1:44:30.639 --> 1:44:32.599
My husband, Taro.

1:44:37.396 --> 1:44:38.689
Did you tell her?

1:44:39.898 --> 1:44:42.651
Yes. I told her everything.

1:44:52.285 --> 1:44:55.539
I'm Riko… Sato.

1:45:02.379 --> 1:45:05.882
Take it slowly. No need to rush.

1:45:15.225 --> 1:45:17.436
The FWE stock certificate.

1:45:17.519 --> 1:45:19.563
Thank you.

1:45:19.646 --> 1:45:23.150
When you sell FWE to Guardian…

1:45:26.528 --> 1:45:29.072
Give these to them.

1:45:31.241 --> 1:45:33.243
This is incredible.

1:45:35.829 --> 1:45:37.330
Soichiro.

1:45:37.414 --> 1:45:41.960
You won't make it in time
for the cold sleep.

1:46:01.855 --> 1:46:03.565
Come, Pete.

1:46:08.779 --> 1:46:10.697
I can't do this.

1:46:17.704 --> 1:46:18.830
Sorry.

1:46:21.083 --> 1:46:22.584
I have to go.

1:46:25.337 --> 1:46:28.298
You're the only thing I have…

1:46:30.842 --> 1:46:31.802
Riko.

1:46:36.264 --> 1:46:37.849
You're only 17.

1:46:40.644 --> 1:46:45.982
You'll keep going to school
and continue studying.

1:46:48.401 --> 1:46:52.864
You'll meet many people and
experience many things.

1:46:56.576 --> 1:46:58.411
There's more to life than me.

1:47:07.420 --> 1:47:08.755
Thanks, Riko.

1:47:24.479 --> 1:47:28.233
Don't reject me twice in a day. You idiot.

1:47:30.694 --> 1:47:32.112
You're right.

1:47:37.409 --> 1:47:39.244
30 years from now.

1:47:42.330 --> 1:47:44.416
I'll regret it in the future.

1:48:05.061 --> 1:48:10.192
Why don't we wait together
for Soichiro to wake up?

1:48:11.526 --> 1:48:14.696
I'm also "Pete."

1:48:17.073 --> 1:48:18.241
But…

1:48:19.618 --> 1:48:22.621
Soichiro, don't you realize yet?

1:48:24.414 --> 1:48:25.624
What?

1:48:27.083 --> 1:48:31.087
It was no coincidence that
I returned to the past.

1:48:32.172 --> 1:48:36.426
My decisions will also be
part of the future.

1:48:38.929 --> 1:48:43.058
You proved that with your life.

1:48:48.063 --> 1:48:51.399
We'll meet again in 30 years.

1:49:01.034 --> 1:49:02.202
Yeah.

1:49:24.140 --> 1:49:26.768
-Mr. Takakura.
-Sorry I'm late.

1:49:26.851 --> 1:49:28.853
Your forehead?

1:49:28.937 --> 1:49:30.397
I fell down.

1:49:30.480 --> 1:49:32.482
Were you drunk?

1:49:32.565 --> 1:49:34.526
-No.
-Really?

1:49:34.609 --> 1:49:37.070
I lost all the documents.

1:49:37.153 --> 1:49:41.408
Are you serious? Unbelievable.

1:49:53.086 --> 1:49:56.589
<i>Dear Mr. Soichiro Takakura.</i>

1:50:04.264 --> 1:50:10.103
<i>I was dubious about</i>
<i>the strange man from the future.</i>

1:50:11.187 --> 1:50:14.149
<i>But I have no doubts now.</i>

1:50:15.650 --> 1:50:17.068
<i>I surrender.</i>

1:50:43.178 --> 1:50:44.679
<i>Just like you said,</i>

1:50:44.763 --> 1:50:45.597
<i>ELECTRONICS APPLICATION</i>

1:50:45.680 --> 1:50:49.517
<i>Riko went to school and studied hard.</i>

1:50:49.601 --> 1:50:54.230
<i>She met many people and</i>
<i>experienced many things.</i>

1:50:55.982 --> 1:50:58.943
<i>She became an inventor like you</i>

1:50:59.027 --> 1:51:04.574
<i>and participated in the development</i>
<i>of PETE and the plasma battery.</i>

1:51:05.784 --> 1:51:12.123
<i>I want to celebrate with you right away</i>
<i>but I already waited 30 years.</i>

1:51:12.916 --> 1:51:16.169
<i>I'll wait for you to come see me.</i>

1:51:18.380 --> 1:51:23.259
<i>When you do, bring Riko with you.</i>

1:51:26.596 --> 1:51:28.890
<i>20 years ago</i>

1:51:30.433 --> 1:51:34.479
<i>she went to sleep like you did</i>
<i>in a sleep sanctuary.</i>

1:52:11.433 --> 1:52:16.980
<i>Yes. There was one mistake</i>
<i>in what you told me.</i>

1:52:21.943 --> 1:52:24.696
<i>Riko was much more</i>

1:52:26.156 --> 1:52:28.032
<i>unrelenting than you thought.</i>

1:53:09.866 --> 1:53:12.660
Good morning, Soichiro.

1:53:16.956 --> 1:53:18.374
Good morning.

1:54:31.155 --> 1:54:36.119
<i>Pete is still looking for</i>
<i>the door into summer.</i>

1:54:37.203 --> 1:54:42.959
<i>With unwavering conviction,</i>
<i>he refuses to give up.</i>
