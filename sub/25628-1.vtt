<i>Here's the dirty little
secret about being rich.</i>

01:00.675 --> 01:03.877
<i>It's not about the money.</i>

01:03.879 --> 01:06.612
<i>It's about the way people see you.</i>

01:06.614 --> 01:09.950
<i>The way you see yourself.</i>

01:09.952 --> 01:12.686
<i>Fuck money.</i>

01:12.688 --> 01:18.595
<i>For kids like Joe Hunt and me,
being rich is about respect.</i>

01:24.233 --> 01:25.832
<i>My name is Dean Karney.</i>

01:25.834 --> 01:29.703
<i>I grew up with parents
who were middle class...</i>

01:29.705 --> 01:31.537
<i>the opposite of rich.</i>

01:31.539 --> 01:32.739
<i>But they wanted the best for me...</i>

01:32.741 --> 01:34.707
<i>scraped together tuition
fees to send me...</i>

01:34.709 --> 01:38.311
<i>to the most elite prep
school in Los Angeles.</i>

01:38.313 --> 01:40.781
<i>The Harvard School for Boys...</i>

01:40.783 --> 01:42.281
<i>where I first met Joe...</i>

01:42.283 --> 01:44.984
<i>the scholarship kid with no friends.</i>

01:44.986 --> 01:48.788
<i>The only thing we had in common
is that neither of us belonged.</i>

01:48.790 --> 01:51.391
<i>I learned early on that
the key was to fake it...</i>

01:51.393 --> 01:53.659
<i>until you make it.</i>

01:53.661 --> 01:56.329
<i>I'd use my charm,
wit, and backhand...</i>

01:56.331 --> 01:58.432
<i>to hang out with the
sons of movie stars...</i>

01:58.434 --> 02:01.534
<i>CEO's, actual royalty.</i>

02:01.536 --> 02:04.237
<i>I played the part perfectly.</i>

02:04.239 --> 02:06.005
<i>By the time I was 25...</i>

02:06.007 --> 02:09.810
<i>I signed a deal worth a
quarter of a billion dollars.</i>

02:09.812 --> 02:13.680
<i>I had it all, the house,
the money, the girl.</i>

02:13.682 --> 02:16.650
<i>And I had the best
partner, Joe Hunt.</i>

02:16.652 --> 02:21.555
<i>In Beverly Hills, the
dream isn't a better life.</i>

02:21.557 --> 02:24.324
<i>It's the best life.</i>

02:24.326 --> 02:26.960
<i>So, let me go back.</i>

02:26.962 --> 02:29.429
<i>It all started six years after
high school and let's just...</i>

02:29.431 --> 02:32.299
<i>say that I wasn't exactly
living up to my full potential.</i>

02:32.301 --> 02:34.767
Are you ready to buy a car,
you handsome son of a bitch?

02:34.769 --> 02:36.302
What do you got?

02:36.304 --> 02:37.570
Well, I got a Bentley.

02:37.572 --> 02:38.838
Boring.

02:38.840 --> 02:41.008
What? You don't like a Bentley?

02:41.010 --> 02:45.682
I got a 1979 IROC driven by
Stallone for three months.

02:48.350 --> 02:50.286
I got a Corvette.

02:51.754 --> 02:53.423
Let me see the 'Vette.

02:56.624 --> 03:00.993
<i>And there he was, my old classmate.</i>

03:00.995 --> 03:03.296
<i>He hadn't changed a bit.</i>

03:03.298 --> 03:04.664
If we take the over and the under...

03:04.666 --> 03:08.367
<i>He was still the
smartest guy in the room.</i>

03:08.369 --> 03:10.772
<i>Still wearing the cheapest suit.</i>

03:13.374 --> 03:15.342
Sorry, ahh...

03:15.344 --> 03:16.475
Corvette.

03:16.477 --> 03:18.280
Mr. Ioku... thank you.

03:19.781 --> 03:22.415
- Dean.
- Joe.

03:22.417 --> 03:24.418
- It's been forever.
- Way too long.

03:24.420 --> 03:26.086
Come here, man.

03:26.088 --> 03:30.356
So, making moves, what have you been up to?

03:30.358 --> 03:32.325
I am working at the Pacific Stock Exchange.

03:32.327 --> 03:34.694
Wall Street of the West, nice.

03:34.696 --> 03:36.096
And what are you up to?

03:36.098 --> 03:40.099
A bit of this, a bit of that.

03:40.101 --> 03:42.336
Are you living downtown?

03:42.338 --> 03:43.969
I'm still living with my father.

03:43.971 --> 03:45.338
Are you shitting me?

03:45.340 --> 03:46.907
Are they not paying you?

03:46.909 --> 03:48.444
Barely.

03:52.681 --> 03:54.848
Is that cash?

03:54.850 --> 03:57.516
Yeah, I just sold the Biltmores a Corvette.

03:57.518 --> 03:59.652
Joe, you shouldn't be
working for these guys.

03:59.654 --> 04:02.122
You should be these guys.
You've gotta get your own thing.

04:02.124 --> 04:05.425
Thanks, I appreciate it.

04:05.427 --> 04:10.497
That would take investors, and
money, and things I don't have.

04:10.499 --> 04:12.435
You know, we would make the perfect team.

04:14.535 --> 04:16.702
Come to Spago tonight. It's
Charlie Bottom's birthday.

04:16.704 --> 04:18.372
We could go talk to him.

04:18.374 --> 04:19.572
Charlie Bottoms from high school?

04:19.574 --> 04:20.807
Yeah.

04:20.809 --> 04:21.908
Yeah, I don't think he's gonna
want to give me his money, Dean.

04:21.910 --> 04:24.944
Of course, he will. Just do
what you did to those guys.

04:24.946 --> 04:26.780
You know, pitch 'em gold.

04:26.782 --> 04:29.882
I don't think so. These
guys hated me in high school.

04:29.884 --> 04:31.117
I can't.

04:31.119 --> 04:32.853
Yes, Joe, you can.

04:32.855 --> 04:35.988
With your brains and my connections.

04:35.990 --> 04:38.427
Think about it, we could own this town.

04:42.131 --> 04:45.601
That's a yes, right? That
looks like a yes to me.

04:47.169 --> 04:49.603
- Okay.
- Yes, Joe!

04:49.605 --> 04:50.603
Okay.

04:50.605 --> 04:52.773
So it is Spago at 9:00
and it's a costume party.

04:52.775 --> 04:54.540
We'll both go as Reagan's.

04:54.542 --> 04:57.576
You're going come, right? Promise?

04:57.578 --> 04:58.711
Yeah.

04:58.713 --> 04:59.612
Okay, cool.

04:59.614 --> 05:01.617
See you later. It's great to see you, man.

05:06.888 --> 05:09.956
<i>L.A. was never a
nine-to-five town.</i>

05:09.958 --> 05:12.459
<i>Deals were made at night
at places so exclusive...</i>

05:12.461 --> 05:15.595
<i>just getting in meant you
had your checkbook ready.</i>

05:15.597 --> 05:18.632
<i>Most exclusive of all was
Spago, which is where...</i>

05:18.634 --> 05:22.735
<i>Charlie Bottoms was holding
his 23rd birthday bash.</i>

05:22.737 --> 05:24.905
<i>Halloween in July.</i>

05:24.907 --> 05:27.641
Sorry, kid, it's a private party.

05:27.643 --> 05:30.543
Oh no, I'm invited. I'm
here with Dean Karney.

05:30.545 --> 05:32.978
- Oh yeah, sure you are.
- Yeah.

05:32.980 --> 05:35.548
I pity tha muthafucka'! Back of the line!

05:35.550 --> 05:38.718
No, it is Charlie Bottoms
birthday and I'm joining him.

05:38.720 --> 05:40.989
Make a hole! Make a hole!

05:50.064 --> 05:53.502
Get out of the way.

05:57.573 --> 05:58.975
Ladies.

06:00.107 --> 06:01.540
Dean! Hey!

06:01.542 --> 06:02.742
- Joe!
- There he is.

06:02.744 --> 06:06.612
Joe, what are you doing? Come on in.

06:06.614 --> 06:08.615
Charlie will be 24 by
the time we get inside.

06:08.617 --> 06:10.115
Come on, Mr. T, may we?

06:10.117 --> 06:12.052
- You got it.
- Thank you.

06:12.054 --> 06:13.823
- Thank you.
- See you later.

06:21.730 --> 06:24.163
Dude, what happened to
us both being Reagan?

06:24.165 --> 06:30.005
We are both Reagan, I'm Nancy.
It's called edge, come on.

06:31.973 --> 06:33.572
Holy shit.

06:33.574 --> 06:34.944
Right, I told you, dude.

06:36.711 --> 06:39.014
Ladies, it is so good to see you.

06:41.249 --> 06:42.548
You're late.

06:42.550 --> 06:45.185
And you are beautiful.

06:45.187 --> 06:48.187
You are forgiven. Charity case?

06:48.189 --> 06:49.826
- Old friend.
- I'm Joe.

06:52.761 --> 06:56.730
<i>The girls at Spago
were out of control.</i>

06:56.732 --> 07:00.165
<i>We ran with a pack of
babes called, The Groovers.</i>

07:00.167 --> 07:02.668
<i>When any new scene hit LA...</i>

07:02.670 --> 07:04.873
<i>they were always on
the crest of the wave.</i>

07:17.119 --> 07:21.588
<i>You don't come to
California for the sunshine.</i>

07:21.590 --> 07:24.727
<i>You come for girls
like Sydney Evans.</i>

07:36.804 --> 07:38.572
Mean Dean.

07:38.574 --> 07:41.341
Hey, Delicious.

07:41.343 --> 07:46.045
- You know her?
- Are you ready?

07:46.047 --> 07:50.050
- What was that for?
- Edge.

07:50.052 --> 07:53.218
There they are! My boys!

07:53.220 --> 07:56.021
Gentlemen, allow me to introduce to you...

07:56.023 --> 07:59.793
our semi-assassinated
President, Joe Hunt...

07:59.795 --> 08:01.595
a very close friend of mine.

08:01.597 --> 08:04.730
Joe, you remember Kyle and Scott Biltmore.

08:04.732 --> 08:07.300
Man, that shit is twisted! I love it!

08:07.302 --> 08:10.002
<i>This crew was the
epitome of a good time.</i>

08:10.004 --> 08:13.706
<i>Which meant the world
clamored to be around them.</i>

08:13.708 --> 08:16.910
<i>I once watched Tom Cruise's
date excuse herself to go...</i>

08:16.912 --> 08:19.144
<i>to the ladies room, only to
leave out the back door...</i>

08:19.146 --> 08:20.947
<i>with both Biltmores.</i>

08:20.949 --> 08:23.917
<i>Then there was Charlie Bottoms.</i>

08:23.919 --> 08:25.384
<i>Aside from being blessed
with good looks...</i>

08:25.386 --> 08:29.055
<i>he was a mastermind in business.</i>

08:29.057 --> 08:32.359
<i>And what did all three of these
Harvard alumni have in common?</i>

08:32.361 --> 08:33.494
<i>Money.</i>

08:33.496 --> 08:36.696
<i>These were the richest
kids in Beverly Hills.</i>

08:36.698 --> 08:37.797
Happy birthday, Charlie.

08:37.799 --> 08:40.133
Thanks for coming.

08:44.805 --> 08:46.708
Got you a gift, Charlie.

08:54.915 --> 08:57.216
What's this, gold?

08:57.218 --> 09:00.052
I've been studying the market
going back forty quarters.

09:00.054 --> 09:02.889
And if we invest in gold right now.

09:02.891 --> 09:04.356
My dad is in gold.

09:04.358 --> 09:06.025
And he says the market's gonna tank.

09:06.027 --> 09:08.128
How is the system going to handle that?

09:08.130 --> 09:09.796
That's why we reverse gold.

09:09.798 --> 09:11.831
We buy and sell a pair of puts and calls...

09:11.833 --> 09:13.432
and set a spread against volatility.

09:13.434 --> 09:14.868
Hold on, shut up a minute.

09:14.870 --> 09:16.403
Hey, did we go to high school together?

09:16.405 --> 09:17.803
No, no, seriously he looks familiar.

09:17.805 --> 09:19.739
Shit! Yeah! Hey, I fucking know this kid!

09:19.741 --> 09:22.008
He was the one who was thrown
off that debate team, right?

09:22.010 --> 09:23.876
And then I stuffed the guy in a locker.

09:23.878 --> 09:25.077
We reverse gold.

09:25.079 --> 09:27.846
- Okay, I've got a Macallan...
- We reverse gold.

09:27.848 --> 09:33.855
Macallan 12, a Glenlivet, a Makers.

09:38.392 --> 09:40.393
Happy birthday, Charlie.

09:40.395 --> 09:42.327
Hey!

09:42.329 --> 09:45.130
So, Dean, you got that
ten grand you owe me?

09:45.132 --> 09:46.398
Or my Corvette?

09:46.400 --> 09:49.372
No, it's back at my house. I'll
bring it to you in the morning.

09:57.045 --> 10:01.217
Dude, we gotta get you outta the valley.

10:13.227 --> 10:17.230
Dean, I will never
freeze up like that again.

10:17.232 --> 10:21.670
I know, brother. I believe in you, man.

10:35.851 --> 10:38.421
<i>Here's... Johnny!</i>

10:45.126 --> 10:49.796
<i>Thank you, the recession
has hit Rodeo Drive.</i>

10:49.798 --> 10:51.798
<i>I saw a guy filling up
his Rolls-Royce today...</i>

10:51.800 --> 10:53.968
<i>at the self-service island.</i>

10:55.971 --> 10:59.538
<i>Yes, and it's depressing
in Beverly Hills...</i>

10:59.540 --> 11:02.509
<i>during a recession.</i>

11:02.511 --> 11:03.976
<i>It's depressing, you
see people lined up...</i>

11:03.978 --> 11:06.812
<i>with food stamps to buy Haagen Daz.</i>

11:43.919 --> 11:46.388
Took you long enough.
I called you hours ago.

11:47.889 --> 11:49.322
Have you even slept?

11:49.324 --> 11:55.360
No, Dean, sit down, the
Biltmores, Charlie, all them.

11:55.362 --> 11:58.464
Their names have given them
everything they could ever want.

11:58.466 --> 12:01.100
Except purpose and
responsibility and self-respect.

12:01.102 --> 12:03.903
They've never had to worry about
how to cover a car payment...

12:03.905 --> 12:05.038
or how to make rent.

12:05.040 --> 12:07.841
Things everyone else stays
up nights worrying about.

12:07.843 --> 12:09.576
So, of course, when I showed
up with a flake of gold...

12:09.578 --> 12:12.345
and asked them to invest, it
didn't mean anything to them.

12:12.347 --> 12:14.614
These guys, they don't care
about market analysis...

12:14.616 --> 12:16.014
or projections or any of that shit.

12:16.016 --> 12:17.149
They want to be part of something?

12:17.151 --> 12:18.250
Exactly.

12:18.252 --> 12:20.953
And every business needs
its founding priniciples.

12:20.955 --> 12:23.489
You've heard of Steve Jobs?

12:23.491 --> 12:26.158
Yeah, of course.

12:26.160 --> 12:27.427
Remind me?

12:27.429 --> 12:30.429
Steve Jobs, he is 26 years old.
He's living the American dream.

12:30.431 --> 12:34.634
He dropped out of college and
now he's worth $149 million.

12:34.636 --> 12:35.802
How?

12:35.804 --> 12:39.471
Because he took computer
technology and made it simple.

12:39.473 --> 12:42.575
He's selling the future.

12:42.577 --> 12:43.879
Read this.

12:45.280 --> 12:48.014
Paradox Philosophy.

12:48.016 --> 12:51.451
Turn bad into good,
even wrong becomes right.

12:51.453 --> 12:56.054
In the right context, you could
take yesterday's failures...

12:56.056 --> 12:58.258
and turn them into tomorrow's successes.

12:58.260 --> 13:00.393
This is rad.

13:00.395 --> 13:02.895
What's the BBC?

13:02.897 --> 13:05.331
It's the name of our company.

13:05.333 --> 13:07.567
What does it stand for?

13:07.569 --> 13:09.034
Remember that poker game...

13:09.036 --> 13:11.604
we could never get into in high school?

13:11.606 --> 13:12.705
No one will know.

13:12.707 --> 13:17.146
But, to us, it'll mean
attaining the unattainable.

13:25.487 --> 13:26.985
What's that?

13:26.987 --> 13:30.992
Kyle's apology. Ten grand.

13:32.394 --> 13:35.528
Holy shit.

13:35.530 --> 13:39.097
Turn it into 20 and everyone
of Kyle's friends and family...

13:39.099 --> 13:41.301
will be lining up to give us their money.

13:41.303 --> 13:43.436
Between word of our success, and this...

13:43.438 --> 13:48.341
it'll spread across Beverly
Hills like wild fire.

13:48.343 --> 13:49.942
<i>Before you turn your nose up...</i>

13:49.944 --> 13:51.510
<i>at a measly ten grand...</i>

13:51.512 --> 13:54.547
<i>remember, these were
the Reagan Years.</i>

13:54.549 --> 13:57.616
<i>Gas was 91 cents a gallon.
Cigarettes were a buck.</i>

13:57.618 --> 14:00.352
<i>And $10,000 was pretty close
to the yearly income...</i>

14:00.354 --> 14:01.687
<i>of an average family.</i>

14:01.689 --> 14:04.523
<i>Joe took Kyle Biltmore's
money and invested in gold.</i>

14:04.525 --> 14:07.159
<i>In three weeks it was
up thirty five percent.</i>

14:07.161 --> 14:09.128
<i>We couldn't lose.</i>

14:09.130 --> 14:10.296
These look great.

14:10.298 --> 14:13.499
And you wanted to use staples.

14:13.501 --> 14:15.567
Okay, so we gotta be at the
Biltmores by 6:00, right?

14:15.569 --> 14:17.135
Let's hit the racks down at Nate and Al's.

14:17.137 --> 14:18.303
I gotta check the closing price on gold.

14:18.305 --> 14:19.438
Well, aren't we up?

14:19.440 --> 14:21.106
Yeah, we were up this morning.

14:21.108 --> 14:22.442
But I gotta check the closing price.

14:22.444 --> 14:25.079
Okay, I just gotta make one stop first.

14:32.319 --> 14:35.556
I just sold this guy a car last weekend.

14:37.125 --> 14:39.024
Nice, huh?

14:39.026 --> 14:40.360
Yeah.

14:43.765 --> 14:46.264
- Mr. Karney, he's expecting you.
- Hi.

14:46.266 --> 14:48.634
I want you in the front
row at that court house...

14:48.636 --> 14:51.236
all right, on his face, with your camera...

14:51.238 --> 14:53.339
the moment the judge reads
those charges, all right?

14:53.341 --> 14:56.308
Every other journalist is gonna
want the same fucking shot!

14:56.310 --> 14:59.345
All right? Come on, get up,
now! I want you to play rough.

14:59.347 --> 15:01.147
I want you to claw their fucking eyes out.

15:01.149 --> 15:03.448
I want you to tell them you
work for Barbara Walters.

15:03.450 --> 15:05.451
Tell 'em you are Barbara
Walters if you have to.

15:05.453 --> 15:07.787
This press badge will get you
access everywhere, all right?

15:07.789 --> 15:10.756
Listen to me, front row. That
close up of John DeLorean?

15:10.758 --> 15:12.792
I don't want you to miss
it! Do you understand?

15:12.794 --> 15:15.028
Yes, sir.

15:15.030 --> 15:16.562
Ah yes.

15:16.564 --> 15:20.099
Bon jour, combien allez-vous
payer des photo de Jon Delorean?

15:21.636 --> 15:24.669
Ah oui, merci.

15:24.671 --> 15:26.538
Nigel, we're a go.

15:26.540 --> 15:30.275
Yes. Buy GM the moment that
those charges are announced.

15:30.277 --> 15:35.048
Yes, at 52 and a half.
That's right, thank you.

15:35.050 --> 15:37.149
<i>Ron Levin was a force of nature.</i>

15:37.151 --> 15:38.784
Oh, hi, Giselle. Hi, it's Ronnie.

15:38.786 --> 15:40.720
Yeah, I'd like three chopped salads.

15:40.722 --> 15:41.955
<i>Made a fortune on Wall Street...</i>

15:41.957 --> 15:44.157
<i>with the Rothschild Group
before going west...</i>

15:44.159 --> 15:47.225
<i>to dabble in any deal
he found interesting...</i>

15:47.227 --> 15:49.227
<i>lucrative, or both.</i>

15:49.229 --> 15:50.428
No, you're staying for lunch.

15:50.430 --> 15:54.366
Yes, and some Tiramisu with
three spoons. Thank you so much.

15:54.368 --> 15:58.504
<i>Warning! Warning! Bullshit alert!</i>

15:58.506 --> 16:00.576
Dean, show me.

16:07.415 --> 16:09.682
All right.

16:09.684 --> 16:14.653
1962 original patina.

16:14.655 --> 16:15.690
Solid chrome.

16:17.825 --> 16:20.559
Yeah, but Dean, these
are not in mint condition.

16:20.561 --> 16:22.427
These have not been stored properly.

16:22.429 --> 16:25.298
I am not paying $2000! No.

16:25.300 --> 16:28.804
I will pay you at most
$600 for the whole set.

16:31.338 --> 16:34.139
And who is your friend, Dean?

16:34.141 --> 16:36.109
This is my partner, Ron.

16:36.111 --> 16:38.110
Do you remember Joe Hunt,
I was telling you about.

16:38.112 --> 16:42.447
Oh, right, yes, Dean told
me you're a trader of sorts?

16:42.449 --> 16:44.583
Yeah, that's right, Mr. Levin.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

16:44.585 --> 16:46.451
I notice you have the afternoon edition.

16:46.453 --> 16:48.187
- You mind if I take a look?
- No, go right ahead.

16:48.189 --> 16:51.490
- Thank you.
- Joe is a genius.

16:51.492 --> 16:54.095
This guy had like a six...

17:00.668 --> 17:02.434
What?

17:02.436 --> 17:07.339
Rough day in the market?

17:07.340 --> 17:10.175
No, not at all.

17:10.176 --> 17:12.411
You know, Mr. Levin, it's
really an honor meeting you.

17:12.413 --> 17:13.746
I'd love for you and I to sit down...

17:13.748 --> 17:15.413
and speak through my investment strategy.

17:15.415 --> 17:16.915
I think you might find it very interesting.

17:16.916 --> 17:20.720
Are you familiar with the
commodities market, Mr. Levin?

17:20.722 --> 17:23.855
Am I familiar with the
commodities market, Dean?

17:23.857 --> 17:27.229
Hm... why don't you tell me.

17:33.734 --> 17:35.768
Holy shit.

17:35.770 --> 17:38.304
That can't be real.

17:38.306 --> 17:39.838
What is it?

17:39.840 --> 17:42.642
It's a Bulla... Sumerian's used it.

17:42.644 --> 17:45.278
They put those tokens
inside their clay pot...

17:45.280 --> 17:46.778
and marked the day a
commodity was delivered.

17:46.780 --> 17:48.748
It's... it's 5,000 years old.

17:48.750 --> 17:50.916
No, it's actually 6000 years old.

17:50.918 --> 17:53.454
You're looking at the world's
first futures contract.

17:54.621 --> 17:56.288
Must be worth a fortune.

17:56.290 --> 17:58.223
Do you want to hold it?

17:58.225 --> 18:00.259
Are you kidding me?

18:00.261 --> 18:02.595
No.

18:02.597 --> 18:05.698
Just be careful. 'Cause
it's worth a lot of money.

18:05.700 --> 18:11.938
Shit! Oh my God.

18:11.940 --> 18:14.839
Oh shit!

18:14.841 --> 18:17.643
- Dean, go find a broom.
- Okay.

18:17.645 --> 18:20.648
Please tell me that was
insured. I'm so sorry.

18:26.620 --> 18:30.323
Insured? That was priceless.

18:30.325 --> 18:33.291
There are only 17 Bullas
on the entire planet.

18:33.293 --> 18:37.663
And every single one of them...

18:37.665 --> 18:41.336
is locked in a museum.

18:44.405 --> 18:46.538
It's a fake.

18:46.540 --> 18:47.839
But you thought it was an original.

18:47.841 --> 18:48.807
Yeah.

18:48.809 --> 18:53.311
And why? Because the
perception of reality...

18:53.313 --> 18:56.281
is more real than reality itself.

18:58.786 --> 19:00.720
<i>The Biltmore's parents
had taken off...</i>

19:00.722 --> 19:01.721
<i>to Europe for the summer.</i>

19:01.723 --> 19:04.356
<i>So the boys had turned their home...</i>

19:04.358 --> 19:06.959
<i>into their own private clubhouse.</i>

19:06.961 --> 19:11.696
<i>The place was always crawling
with Beverly Hills royalty.</i>

19:11.698 --> 19:13.732
Mean Dean gonna get this
show on the road, or what?

19:13.734 --> 19:16.736
Probably boning in the bathroom.

19:16.738 --> 19:18.407
Go get him and hurry it up!

19:19.906 --> 19:22.441
Dean, we took a hit in the market today.

19:22.443 --> 19:23.909
What? How bad?

19:23.911 --> 19:26.412
We wiped out.

19:26.414 --> 19:28.580
- All of it?
- Half.

19:28.582 --> 19:29.749
The rest is still in the account.

19:29.751 --> 19:33.586
Yo, Dean, your guests are waiting!

19:33.588 --> 19:37.823
Uh, just give us a second, Kyle.

19:37.825 --> 19:40.726
Wait, what are you doing?

19:40.728 --> 19:42.961
I'm giving Kyle his money back.

19:42.963 --> 19:44.096
What, you're gonna tell him now?

19:44.098 --> 19:46.432
After the presentation,
in private, yes, I have to.

19:46.434 --> 19:50.536
What presentation, Joe? There
is no way these guys will buy...

19:50.538 --> 19:52.672
our pitch if Kyle's
bitching about a wipe out.

19:52.674 --> 19:54.406
I know, but I don't have a choice.

19:54.408 --> 19:56.308
All you have is your rep.

19:56.310 --> 19:58.076
Dean, I'm just gonna
be honest with the guy.

19:58.078 --> 19:59.679
He knew there were risks
when he got involved.

19:59.681 --> 20:02.748
He doesn't know.

20:02.750 --> 20:04.950
What do you mean, he doesn't know?

20:04.952 --> 20:07.752
There was no apologies?

20:07.754 --> 20:09.555
You gave me his money without him knowing?

20:09.557 --> 20:11.057
Sorry, I wanted to put wind in your sails.

20:11.059 --> 20:12.192
I should have told you the truth.

20:12.194 --> 20:18.530
But think how many legends
started exactly like this.

20:18.532 --> 20:21.499
The Kennedys were rum runners
before they ran the world.

20:21.501 --> 20:24.772
This is our chance, come on.

20:31.011 --> 20:32.912
Gentlemen, if I can have
your attention, please?

20:32.914 --> 20:35.548
Thank you for coming by tonight.

20:35.550 --> 20:37.883
Some of you may remember my friend...

20:37.885 --> 20:40.385
Joe Hunt from High School.

20:40.387 --> 20:44.056
We spoke to some of you guys
at Spago around three weeks ago.

20:44.058 --> 20:45.257
If you can't remember the night...

20:45.259 --> 20:48.728
it's the night Charlie has been
trying to forget ever since.

20:48.730 --> 20:50.363
No way.

20:50.365 --> 20:52.964
But I'm not the guy to talk
to you about the minutia...

20:52.966 --> 20:54.733
of why we are here.

20:54.735 --> 20:59.741
So, Joe? You want to...

21:01.442 --> 21:05.144
Want to tell them about our proposal?

21:05.146 --> 21:07.813
<i>You want to talk about a paradox?</i>

21:07.815 --> 21:10.816
<i>Joe's bad break was our lucky day.</i>

21:10.818 --> 21:13.118
<i>When he got caught in my lie...</i>

21:13.120 --> 21:16.756
<i>we broke through to
a whole, new level.</i>

21:16.758 --> 21:21.697
<i>All he had to do was
cross one tiny line.</i>

21:24.598 --> 21:25.998
Gentlemen!

21:26.000 --> 21:28.768
You are the young Turks
of L.A. heirs to empires...

21:28.770 --> 21:30.435
sons of scions.

21:30.437 --> 21:34.173
But, what would you do
to earn it on your own?

21:34.175 --> 21:37.977
To look your fathers in
the eye, not for a handout.

21:37.979 --> 21:41.980
But with a handful of cash,
that you pulled down, with this!

21:41.982 --> 21:45.984
Dump the opportunity at your
fingertips? Fuck no! Seize it.

21:45.986 --> 21:50.556
Now is the time to own your own destiny...

21:50.558 --> 21:55.861
and become part of something great!

21:55.863 --> 21:56.961
The BBC.

21:56.963 --> 22:00.566
What does BBC stand for?

22:00.568 --> 22:01.700
Exactly.

22:01.702 --> 22:03.701
Within that question lies our hook?

22:03.703 --> 22:08.807
Each investor will ask, "What is
BBC?" Are we a holding company?

22:08.809 --> 22:13.077
Are we an investment
pool? Are we a social club?

22:13.079 --> 22:14.747
All the above.

22:14.749 --> 22:18.083
Buy on mystery. Sell on history.

22:18.085 --> 22:20.452
I like it.

22:20.454 --> 22:22.221
Sounds like old money.

22:22.223 --> 22:24.789
Fuck old money!

22:24.791 --> 22:29.127
How about we make some new money?

22:29.129 --> 22:32.698
We all stand on the verge of
wildly profitable ventures...

22:32.700 --> 22:34.967
in this room alone.

22:34.969 --> 22:38.971
Scott, you bought a Benz
in Munich, drove it...

22:38.973 --> 22:43.741
across Europe and sold it right
here for twice what you paid.

22:43.743 --> 22:47.179
That is a hundred percent profit.

22:47.181 --> 22:50.215
Charlie, how many times
have you advised your dad...

22:50.217 --> 22:54.720
on energy stocks, only for
him to make the big move.

22:54.722 --> 22:58.857
And Kyle, you believed
in my trading system...

22:58.859 --> 23:00.792
to the tune of $10,000.

23:00.794 --> 23:02.728
- You what?
- I did?

23:02.730 --> 23:05.730
Yes! You did!

23:05.732 --> 23:08.166
And here's your first disbursement check!

23:08.168 --> 23:11.836
Wait, five thousand
dollars? Is this what's left?

23:11.838 --> 23:15.673
No, that is profit.

23:15.675 --> 23:17.843
<i>Instead of admitting
we lost five grand...</i>

23:17.845 --> 23:19.278
The rest is still in gold.

23:19.280 --> 23:22.080
<i>Joe told them we made five grand.</i>

23:22.082 --> 23:26.085
Fifty percent, in three weeks.

23:26.087 --> 23:27.720
Yeah.

23:27.722 --> 23:29.223
God damn.

23:34.761 --> 23:36.060
This is just a loan.

23:36.062 --> 23:38.963
Okay.

23:38.965 --> 23:40.965
What do we do if he
asks for his money back?

23:40.967 --> 23:43.602
Look, Dean, this weekend?

23:43.604 --> 23:44.970
You're gonna scrounge up every dime...

23:44.972 --> 23:47.972
so we can reinvest and make his money back.

23:47.974 --> 23:50.643
You got it, Joe.

23:50.645 --> 23:53.746
So guys, think it over, let us know.

23:53.748 --> 23:55.079
We'll see you later.

23:55.081 --> 23:56.584
Bullshit.

23:59.086 --> 24:02.086
You guys are coming out with us tonight.

24:05.926 --> 24:07.893
Yo, Tim!

24:07.895 --> 24:11.564
This cash machine, right here,
is my new best friend, Joe Hunt.

24:11.566 --> 24:14.299
If he ever waits in line again,
and I'll sic the wolf on you.

24:14.301 --> 24:16.602
He doesn't mean that,
Tim. Pleasure to meet you.

24:16.604 --> 24:19.571
Welcome to Spago, Mr. Hunt.

24:19.573 --> 24:20.873
Thanks, Tim.

24:20.875 --> 24:21.876
Hello, Tim.

24:23.077 --> 24:24.876
Ladies.

24:24.878 --> 24:26.578
Gentlemen, if I may.

24:26.580 --> 24:28.980
To Paradox Philosophy.

24:28.982 --> 24:31.717
Wait, wait, wait, Para-what?

24:31.719 --> 24:32.852
Paradox Philosophy.

24:32.854 --> 24:35.854
It's our theory that is
outlined in each prospectus.

24:35.856 --> 24:39.090
Three weeks ago, Joe blew
his pitch to you guys.

24:39.092 --> 24:43.127
And tonight, he made you five grand, Kyle.

24:43.129 --> 24:44.296
That is a paradox.

24:44.298 --> 24:46.065
Winning by losing.

24:46.067 --> 24:48.834
Seeing the paradox
allows you to do things...

24:48.836 --> 24:51.069
that you thought you couldn't.

24:51.071 --> 24:54.339
Cross lines you said you wouldn't.

24:54.341 --> 24:55.974
For example, Charlie.

24:55.976 --> 24:59.345
What is the worst thing
you can imagine doing?

24:59.347 --> 25:03.115
The worst? Murder?

25:03.117 --> 25:04.983
Okay, perfect.

25:04.985 --> 25:08.686
So could you kill someone
for a million dollars?

25:08.688 --> 25:10.021
No.

25:10.023 --> 25:11.323
See?

25:11.325 --> 25:13.124
That's a line you can't cross.

25:13.126 --> 25:14.626
Yeah, but who would?

25:14.628 --> 25:15.760
Well, no one here for sure, but...

25:15.762 --> 25:17.096
Kyle, what if you walked into a room...

25:17.098 --> 25:18.730
and your mother was being raped?

25:18.732 --> 25:20.699
Would you kill then?

25:20.701 --> 25:24.036
If my mother was being
raped? Yes, well, fuck yeah.

25:24.038 --> 25:26.005
Yeah, but under those
circumstances, anybody would.

25:26.007 --> 25:27.271
Okay, so then change the circumstances...

25:27.273 --> 25:28.673
and you'll cross that line...

25:28.675 --> 25:31.710
the line you said you wouldn't cross.

25:31.712 --> 25:35.114
So by shifting your perspective
you can justify anything.

25:35.116 --> 25:37.682
Justify, that implies right and wrong.

25:37.684 --> 25:39.884
But if you reconcile your perspective...

25:39.886 --> 25:43.023
then right and wrong become relative.

25:44.825 --> 25:49.228
Chateau la fete Rothschild,
1959 finest Bordeaux.

25:49.230 --> 25:50.429
Hey, yo, we didn't order that.

25:50.431 --> 25:54.700
This is complements of Chef
Puck's closest friend, sir.

25:54.702 --> 25:57.435
Dean. Excuse me, boys.

25:57.437 --> 26:00.038
He asks that you go alone.

26:00.040 --> 26:02.176
That's okay, come on, Dean.

26:04.979 --> 26:07.179
I think he's awful.
You think he's talented?

26:07.181 --> 26:08.313
Yes, I do.

26:08.315 --> 26:09.714
Oh my God, his art is...

26:09.716 --> 26:11.016
Graffiti, first of all, looks bourgeois.

26:11.018 --> 26:12.116
No, it doesn't.

26:12.118 --> 26:12.984
And all of his art looks
like it's finger painting.

26:12.986 --> 26:14.952
I love finger painting, it's so mature.

26:14.954 --> 26:16.721
Oh, that's why everyone
thinks he's a genius.

26:16.723 --> 26:17.990
Because you love him,
and you say it publicly.

26:17.992 --> 26:19.057
So?

26:19.059 --> 26:20.858
But I'm telling you this,
no one is gonna remember...

26:20.860 --> 26:22.827
Jean-Michel Basket...

26:22.829 --> 26:24.096
Basquiat.

26:24.098 --> 26:26.030
Basquiat... in like, 15
minutes. Forget about it.

26:26.032 --> 26:28.067
- Oh, Joe, hello.
- Mr. Levin.

26:28.069 --> 26:31.336
You came to say hi, and
you brought Dean anyway.

26:31.338 --> 26:33.838
Mr. Levin, I want to say
thank you for the wine.

26:33.840 --> 26:35.473
And but of course I had to
bring my partner with me.

26:35.475 --> 26:37.209
Well, I guess I'll have to respect that.

26:37.211 --> 26:39.411
But if you don't call me Ron,
I might have to murder you.

26:39.413 --> 26:43.281
And this is my friend, Andy. Andy, Joe.

26:43.283 --> 26:44.883
It is a pleasure to meet you.

26:44.885 --> 26:46.484
Nice to meet you.

26:46.486 --> 26:49.721
Andy is in town doing, are you ready?

26:49.723 --> 26:53.192
An episode of The Love
Boat, with Milton Berle.

26:53.194 --> 26:55.827
Oh, and apparently Milton
Berle has a Love Boat...

26:55.829 --> 26:58.262
between his legs.

26:58.264 --> 26:59.998
It's true.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.300
Any dick contest, he takes
out just enough to win.

27:02.302 --> 27:04.737
- It's as big as a salami.
- It is?

27:04.739 --> 27:06.038
- It's big, it's like huge.
- Wow.

27:06.040 --> 27:08.777
Do you like salami, Joe?

27:10.511 --> 27:15.913
Who doesn't, dude?

27:15.915 --> 27:17.115
So you know, Ron.

27:17.117 --> 27:19.984
We just cleared fifty
percent in three weeks.

27:19.986 --> 27:21.953
Really? And I thought for sure
you took a horrible beating...

27:21.955 --> 27:23.855
this afternoon.

27:23.857 --> 27:25.356
No.

27:25.358 --> 27:28.426
I shorted gold hard and
made out like a bandit.

27:28.428 --> 27:30.429
Well, that is quite a return.

27:30.431 --> 27:31.696
I'm serious.

27:31.698 --> 27:33.531
We really should get together
and talk about you investing.

27:33.533 --> 27:36.335
You see I knew it the
moment I saw you, Joe.

27:36.337 --> 27:41.276
You're a hustler, just like me.

27:42.909 --> 27:44.910
Thank you so much for coming to say hi.

27:44.912 --> 27:47.445
You will excuse us, won't you, Joe?

27:47.447 --> 27:48.547
Of course, of course.

27:48.549 --> 27:55.319
Joe, this is for you. Sugar,
because you are so sweet.

27:55.321 --> 27:56.724
Thank you so much.

28:03.430 --> 28:05.830
I say we write two checks right now, bro.

28:05.832 --> 28:07.231
Think so?

28:07.233 --> 28:09.500
I fucking know so, bro!

28:09.502 --> 28:14.876
Hey this goose shits golden eggs.

28:21.182 --> 28:23.248
Hey Joe! Joe!

28:23.250 --> 28:25.450
Hey, can we have a word real quick?

28:25.452 --> 28:29.086
Our dad is always riding our ass
saying "Think about the future."

28:29.088 --> 28:32.761
Well here is our thoughts.

28:35.261 --> 28:37.397
Kill it.

28:40.434 --> 28:41.967
- Yes! Yes!
- Go make us some money.

28:41.969 --> 28:43.836
Have a good night.

28:43.838 --> 28:47.439
Hey, your name is Sydney,
right? And you are an artist.

28:47.441 --> 28:49.540
I work for one.

28:49.542 --> 28:51.542
No, I hear you are a
really talented artist.

28:51.544 --> 28:54.179
Dean told me. Right?

28:54.181 --> 28:56.381
We have an investment company.

28:56.383 --> 28:59.317
And I was just talking to Andy Warhol.

28:59.319 --> 29:02.453
Do you know Andy Warhol,
have you heard of him?

29:02.455 --> 29:03.355
Come see me!

29:03.357 --> 29:06.024
Obviously yeah, you have heard of him.

29:06.026 --> 29:07.159
Yeah.

29:07.161 --> 29:10.229
But, I'm you know, trying
to land people like Andy.

29:10.231 --> 29:12.230
But I don't know anything about the scene.

29:12.232 --> 29:14.232
It looks like you are getting
to know the scene pretty well.

29:14.234 --> 29:15.433
No, the art scene.

29:15.435 --> 29:18.569
I don't know the first thing about it.

29:18.571 --> 29:24.076
So, I was thinking,
maybe you could tutor me?

29:24.078 --> 29:25.243
Tutor you?

29:25.245 --> 29:27.246
You know, give me a crash course in art.

29:27.248 --> 29:28.413
I don't know anything about it.

29:28.415 --> 29:32.584
I got this for you.

29:32.586 --> 29:38.026
It could be down payment on a crash course.

29:39.193 --> 29:40.595
I'll think about it.

29:47.033 --> 29:50.535
<i>Joe sold the world that night.</i>

29:50.537 --> 29:54.439
<i>And the Biltmores'
money put us to work.</i>

29:54.441 --> 29:55.941
<i>Before the Euro, there
were these things...</i>

29:55.943 --> 29:57.643
<i>called Deutsche Marks.</i>

29:57.645 --> 29:59.944
<i>And dollars bought German
shit for dirt cheap...</i>

29:59.946 --> 30:02.647
<i>that we could sell here
for a hefty markup.</i>

30:02.649 --> 30:04.650
<i>We made a deal with
Scott's guy in Munich...</i>

30:04.652 --> 30:07.088
<i>and the BBC entered the gray market.</i>

30:10.991 --> 30:17.561
<i>The M635-CSi was the nastiest
thing on the Autobahn.</i>

30:17.563 --> 30:21.199
<i>You have heard of an M5, or an M3?</i>

30:21.201 --> 30:24.536
<i>This was the first
street-legal M class ever.</i>

30:24.538 --> 30:27.940
<i>You couldn't get them in America.</i>

30:27.942 --> 30:30.078
<i>Which meant everyone
in L.A. wanted one.</i>

30:32.046 --> 30:34.046
Give me the keys.

30:34.048 --> 30:35.116
They're in the car.

30:48.361 --> 30:50.261
Have you driven a new car before?

30:50.263 --> 30:52.263
This car is worth more than my apartment.

30:52.265 --> 30:55.032
Are you sure you want to
put miles in this puppy...

30:55.034 --> 30:56.401
before it passes smog?

30:58.504 --> 31:01.341
Oh yeah.

31:15.222 --> 31:18.589
So, the BBC has a motor pool now.

31:18.591 --> 31:21.593
Come on, I gotta get dressed.
So, let me get this straight.

31:21.595 --> 31:24.997
Germany, pass smog for five...

31:24.999 --> 31:27.598
and sell them in Beverly Hills for $70,000?

31:27.600 --> 31:29.601
$80,000. It's a five-fold profit.

31:29.603 --> 31:32.604
Ron, you can share if you go in on BBC.

31:32.606 --> 31:34.405
I'm thinking twenty grand.

31:34.407 --> 31:37.275
Fifteen grand.

31:37.277 --> 31:38.476
Ten, we can start small.

31:38.478 --> 31:41.613
I spent ten thousand dollars
on dinner the other night, Joe.

31:41.615 --> 31:43.615
You could buy a Chrysler for that.

31:43.617 --> 31:46.117
Which is exactly why I
called it the Chrysler Dinner.

31:46.119 --> 31:47.786
Which is a steal compared
to the Lincoln dinner...

31:47.788 --> 31:50.288
I'm throwing tonight at Mr. Chows.

31:50.290 --> 31:54.358
Joe, you think too small.

31:54.360 --> 31:55.594
Maybe if you are gonna pitch me...

31:55.596 --> 31:58.797
you ought to think about
adding a digit or two.

31:58.799 --> 32:03.567
Because when I go in, I go all in.

32:03.569 --> 32:05.569
Okay, get your checkbook out.

32:05.571 --> 32:07.705
No, no, no, it's gonna
take more than a 635-CSi...

32:07.707 --> 32:09.142
to get my check book out.

32:11.811 --> 32:14.378
I invest in relationships, Joe.

32:14.380 --> 32:15.513
Not deals.

32:15.515 --> 32:17.548
People, not stock.

32:17.550 --> 32:19.651
- You read our prospectus?
- Yes.

32:19.653 --> 32:21.653
And I made some notes in the margins.

32:21.655 --> 32:24.789
You're kind of all over the place, Joe.

32:24.791 --> 32:28.059
Low risk spreads on high commodities.

32:28.061 --> 32:31.096
Performance BMW's in the gray market.

32:31.098 --> 32:32.631
And a gold mill?

32:32.633 --> 32:34.569
Ron, that gold mill is
the deal of the century.

32:36.837 --> 32:39.604
I'll tell you what I did
like. Go to the first page.

32:39.606 --> 32:45.546
That is interesting. That
is the essence of success.

32:47.713 --> 32:51.615
Reminded me a lot of when I
got in hot water with the SEC.

32:51.617 --> 32:52.517
Oh, don't worry about it.

32:52.519 --> 32:54.086
Anybody who knows what they're doing...

32:54.088 --> 32:56.688
eventually gets flagged by the SEC.

32:56.690 --> 32:58.690
You should wear it as a badge of honor.

32:58.692 --> 33:00.692
I had been working at Rothchild for a year.

33:00.694 --> 33:03.295
When suddenly I found
myself thrown in front...

33:03.297 --> 33:06.298
of a discipline committee and
was forced to defend myself.

33:06.300 --> 33:09.601
And I had nothing.

33:09.603 --> 33:13.838
21 stories and none of
them good, so I came clean.

33:13.840 --> 33:16.274
They take your license?

33:16.276 --> 33:18.175
No, I mean they could have,
they should have, but no.

33:18.177 --> 33:21.179
Because what I was doing
wasn't illegal... yet.

33:21.181 --> 33:26.484
I was ahead of the law. I mean,
it was unethical and corrupt.

33:26.486 --> 33:28.487
Immoral if you believe
in that sort of thing.

33:28.489 --> 33:32.257
But it wasn't illegal, so they had nothing.

33:32.259 --> 33:35.160
So guess what they did.

33:35.162 --> 33:39.364
They asked me to write the code...

33:39.366 --> 33:43.401
to prohibit the kind of
trading that I had been doing.

33:43.403 --> 33:46.137
How brilliant is that?

33:46.139 --> 33:50.342
That hearing made me with the SEC.

33:50.344 --> 33:53.377
And I realized that day that...

33:53.379 --> 33:58.819
sometimes the truth is the best lie.

34:00.753 --> 34:01.819
Why come to me?

34:01.821 --> 34:04.321
Your father certainly
has his wealthier friends.

34:04.323 --> 34:06.357
But none he respects more.

34:06.359 --> 34:07.558
<i>Our first investors became...</i>

34:07.560 --> 34:09.194
<i>our number one sales team.</i>

34:09.196 --> 34:10.293
Just the kind of investor...

34:10.295 --> 34:12.730
we wanna do business with at the BBC.

34:12.732 --> 34:15.266
It's not at all about money, Mr. Baxter.

34:15.268 --> 34:17.935
<i>And Joe's strategy
put us on the map.</i>

34:17.937 --> 34:20.437
It's about integrity.

34:20.438 --> 34:22.607
<i>The only difference
between a nobody...</i>

34:22.609 --> 34:27.779
<i>and a player, is an address.</i>

34:27.781 --> 34:30.281
286 horsepower... Uncle Hank,

34:30.283 --> 34:34.187
and you are the only one
at the LACC driving one.

34:36.289 --> 34:38.621
Dad, you know I don't
take investing lightly.

34:38.623 --> 34:40.625
And I've never come to you before.

34:40.627 --> 34:42.627
I mean, I really think this is a winner.

34:42.629 --> 34:43.962
BBC is ground breaking.

34:43.964 --> 34:45.964
Doing things that is revolutionary.

34:45.966 --> 34:48.299
And the principles which Granddad had

34:48.301 --> 34:49.967
when he started the family business.

34:49.969 --> 34:52.404
I like the sign. The
bold makes a statement.

34:52.406 --> 34:54.406
It is bold and beautiful, right?

34:54.408 --> 34:56.274
If you'd like to come through...

34:56.275 --> 34:58.209
this will be our conference room.

34:58.211 --> 35:00.245
I'm not just a member
of the BBC, Mr. Baxter.

35:00.247 --> 35:01.912
Line two.

35:01.914 --> 35:02.546
Yeah.

35:02.548 --> 35:03.515
Yeah, yeah, ask my father.

35:03.517 --> 35:07.419
I believe in Joe Hunt.
I believe in his vision.

35:07.421 --> 35:09.254
This is the easiest money
you are ever going to make.

35:09.256 --> 35:14.625
I mean, Joe got me fifty
percent in three weeks.

35:14.627 --> 35:15.926
Fifty percent in three weeks.

35:15.928 --> 35:17.595
Total Mad Maxing the market.

35:17.597 --> 35:19.830
I'm talking... Blows the doors off

35:19.832 --> 35:21.299
anything you'd make at Shearson Lehman!

35:21.301 --> 35:23.000
Kind of sounds too good to be true.

35:23.002 --> 35:25.270
It looks true to me.

35:25.272 --> 35:26.638
<i>We pulled in everyone.</i>

35:26.640 --> 35:29.908
<i>BBC was no longer our game.
It belonged to all of us.</i>

35:29.910 --> 35:32.910
<i>It was a family, which
was the secret to the BBC.</i>

35:32.912 --> 35:34.145
- I'm in.
- All right.

35:34.147 --> 35:35.379
<i>We wanted members with friends...</i>

35:35.381 --> 35:37.314
<i>and families who were
titans of the west coast.</i>

35:37.316 --> 35:38.485
I'm in.

35:40.953 --> 35:42.390
I'm in.

35:44.258 --> 35:48.259
- I'm in.
- How much?

35:48.261 --> 35:51.595
Call.

35:51.597 --> 35:52.930
Boys!

35:52.932 --> 35:54.935
Come on, guys. Come on.

35:56.903 --> 35:58.169
Gentlemen...

35:58.171 --> 36:00.272
<i>But Ron didn't trust
outside brokers.</i>

36:00.274 --> 36:02.439
<i>Insisted on using his own.</i>

36:02.441 --> 36:03.475
<i>Good morning, Morgan Brokerage.</i>

36:03.477 --> 36:04.575
<i>How may I help you?</i>

36:04.577 --> 36:05.977
Hello, Frank Piedmont please.

36:05.979 --> 36:06.914
<i>One moment.</i>

36:08.515 --> 36:09.613
<i>Frank Piedmont.</i>

36:09.615 --> 36:11.783
Hello, Frank, I'm here with Joe Hunt.

36:11.785 --> 36:13.951
<i>Hey, Ron, hey, Joe.</i>

36:13.953 --> 36:15.620
Good afternoon, Mr. Piedmont.

36:15.622 --> 36:17.721
Ron has told me about your
unique trading system...

36:17.723 --> 36:19.790
in the gold commodities market.

36:19.792 --> 36:21.660
I'm impressed. That's not easy to do.

36:21.662 --> 36:24.462
Most people lose their shirts
if they stay in gold too long.

36:24.464 --> 36:25.629
I'm sorry to be so direct...

36:25.631 --> 36:28.269
but I would like to check
the balance in the account.

36:39.345 --> 36:42.413
Frank, do you mind
saying that one more time?

36:42.415 --> 36:44.082
<i>At closing market
today, the account...</i>

36:44.084 --> 36:46.383
<i>balance was four million,
one hundred thousand...</i>

36:46.385 --> 36:48.288
<i>two dollars and five cents.</i>

36:53.894 --> 36:54.926
Thank you, Frank.

36:54.928 --> 36:58.331
Joe will be back in
touch very soon, I'm sure.

37:00.334 --> 37:02.633
Remember the butterflies
in your gut right now.

37:02.635 --> 37:06.805
And know that is the show.

37:06.807 --> 37:08.807
You sell a BMW, you pay your rent.

37:08.809 --> 37:10.741
You refine a tanker full of crude...

37:10.743 --> 37:12.676
you cover your overhead for a year.

37:12.678 --> 37:16.448
But if you perform on the
account I just handed you...

37:16.450 --> 37:22.787
then your lives will never be the same.

37:22.789 --> 37:27.058
Think big and you will be big.

37:27.060 --> 37:29.727
Unless, of course, I got you boys wrong.

37:29.729 --> 37:34.499
I mean, after all, what
does the BBC stand for again?

37:34.501 --> 37:35.533
Oh right.

37:35.535 --> 37:38.602
Bitching Boring Crew?

37:38.604 --> 37:43.677
The Brainless Boneheaded Cartel?

37:46.513 --> 37:56.720
Or are you, the Billionaire Boys Club?

37:56.722 --> 37:58.555
<i>One Ron said think big,
we took it to heart.</i>

37:58.557 --> 38:01.926
<i>From now on, every
check that came in...</i>

38:01.928 --> 38:03.595
<i>went towards more luxury.</i>

38:03.597 --> 38:06.633
<i>Which meant more loans.</i>

38:07.834 --> 38:09.100
Billionaire...

38:09.102 --> 38:10.671
Or bust.

38:12.138 --> 38:15.406
As one of our first
investors, Mr. Baxter...

38:15.408 --> 38:17.477
I wanted to come by personally
and deliver this check.

38:19.613 --> 38:23.747
50 percent return, just like we promised.

38:23.749 --> 38:27.785
I don't normally invest, but
I have to say that the BBC...

38:27.787 --> 38:31.423
has really struck a cord with me.

38:31.425 --> 38:33.792
Especially watching
young men like yourselves.

38:33.794 --> 38:37.729
I can only hope my sons
follow in your footsteps.

38:37.731 --> 38:43.500
Which is why I've decided.

38:43.502 --> 38:45.872
And invest it for them, in the BBC.

38:48.874 --> 38:50.875
Hell, I even took out a second mortgage.

38:50.877 --> 38:54.479
I'm hooked. I'm hooked.

38:54.481 --> 38:55.946
<i>You're probably
wondering why we take</i>

38:55.948 --> 38:59.750
<i>this money when we just got
four mil from Ron Levin.</i>

38:59.752 --> 39:02.654
<i>We weren't actually holding
Ron's money in our hands.</i>

39:02.656 --> 39:05.622
<i>We were just authorized to
trade that money on his behalf.</i>

39:05.624 --> 39:07.794
<i>We were paper rich, but cash poor.</i>

39:15.502 --> 39:17.634
Dean, look at this.

39:17.636 --> 39:20.238
That's his kid's college fund.

39:20.240 --> 39:23.174
That is the house that they live in.

39:23.176 --> 39:25.977
We can't keep promising
fifty percent returns.

39:25.979 --> 39:28.212
We are committing fraud.

39:28.214 --> 39:30.151
Should we give it back?

39:34.153 --> 39:39.823
Honestly, Joe, the only
difference between high risk...

39:39.825 --> 39:44.432
investing and a Ponzi
scheme, is how it all ends.

39:46.765 --> 39:50.738
That check is just one more
reason, to pull it all off.

39:54.841 --> 39:57.575
You know what beats a kids college fund?

39:57.577 --> 39:59.843
Four kids college funds.

39:59.845 --> 40:04.048
We are gonna make Baxter so much money...

40:04.050 --> 40:07.218
he pays off both his mortgages.

40:07.220 --> 40:09.156
And sends every kid to grad school.

40:17.897 --> 40:19.763
Hi, I'm meeting Burt Langdon.

40:19.765 --> 40:22.200
Oh, Mr. Langdon just called.

40:22.202 --> 40:24.134
He wanted me to tell you that
he had a family emergency...

40:24.136 --> 40:26.837
and that he will call you
tomorrow and he was very sorry.

40:26.839 --> 40:28.542
Oh, thanks.

40:37.249 --> 40:43.020
Okay, so who has got the big
schlong, is it Scott or Kyle?

40:43.022 --> 40:46.024
What? You are sleeping with both of them!

40:46.026 --> 40:48.091
No, but it is kind of a disaster.

40:48.093 --> 40:50.263
Something is very wrong with you guys.

40:53.732 --> 40:55.033
Are you following me?

40:55.035 --> 40:58.269
What? No, I had a meeting here.

40:58.271 --> 41:00.171
I think he is stalking you.

41:00.173 --> 41:03.042
No, I swear. You can ask the hostess.

41:05.644 --> 41:07.245
We're kidding.

41:07.247 --> 41:08.680
I have to go meet Dean.

41:08.682 --> 41:10.247
No, you don't.

41:10.249 --> 41:11.950
Such a nightmare when your
girlfriends hate your boyfriend.

41:11.952 --> 41:13.151
Oh...

41:13.153 --> 41:16.955
Come on, I'll take you to
see Scotty boy or is it Kyle?

41:16.957 --> 41:18.923
Whoever is home.

41:18.925 --> 41:20.258
- Love you, babes.
- Bye.

41:20.260 --> 41:22.263
- See you tonight at the gallery.
- Bye.

41:26.365 --> 41:29.866
So, do you not like Dean for Q?

41:29.868 --> 41:31.868
Or do you just not like Dean at all?

41:31.870 --> 41:33.604
I am not a fan of Mean Dean.

41:33.606 --> 41:34.705
Mean Dean?

41:34.707 --> 41:36.707
Why does everyone call him that?

41:36.709 --> 41:38.776
You don't know?

41:38.778 --> 41:41.178
In third grade he burned down
the game room at Camp Tawonga...

41:41.180 --> 41:42.980
and blamed my cousin Jake for it.

41:42.982 --> 41:44.948
Jake got sent home for the entire summer...

41:44.950 --> 41:47.785
and Dean won the camp tennis championship.

41:47.787 --> 41:49.220
That's not a coincidence.

41:49.222 --> 41:51.888
You are talking about third grade.

41:51.890 --> 41:53.890
A leopard doesn't change its spots.

41:53.892 --> 41:55.627
Acutally a leopard does change its spots...

41:55.629 --> 41:58.930
according to Scientific American.

41:58.932 --> 42:00.932
Are you always this ahh, literal?

42:00.934 --> 42:02.700
Oh yeah, always.

42:02.702 --> 42:07.270
Do you want some?

42:07.272 --> 42:08.272
No thanks.

42:08.274 --> 42:09.807
I'm good.

42:09.809 --> 42:12.343
Do you not drink?

42:12.345 --> 42:14.281
I've actually never had a sip.

42:16.115 --> 42:17.115
Tell me more.

42:17.117 --> 42:19.816
What do you want to know?

42:19.818 --> 42:20.951
Everything.

42:20.953 --> 42:23.854
Wow, okay.

42:23.856 --> 42:25.423
Yeah, I'm from the Valley.

42:25.425 --> 42:29.127
I went to Harvard School for
Boys on a full scholarship.

42:29.129 --> 42:31.194
My mom left when I was 15.

42:31.196 --> 42:34.866
So I choose to stay with
my dad. Okay, your turn.

42:34.868 --> 42:37.769
I grew up in Beverly Hills.

42:37.771 --> 42:40.904
I went to an all-girls high school.

42:40.906 --> 42:44.676
My parents are still together,
happily if there's such a thing.

42:44.678 --> 42:46.778
Have you always wanted to be an artist?

42:46.780 --> 42:48.779
Always is a strong word, but yeah.

42:48.781 --> 42:51.082
Yeah, I guess so.

42:51.084 --> 42:54.084
Cool. And you said you had a show tonight?

42:54.086 --> 42:55.386
Not me, my boss.

42:55.388 --> 42:59.122
Oh, is his stuff any good?

42:59.124 --> 43:01.959
I'll let you be the judge.

43:01.961 --> 43:03.830
Was that an invitation?

43:12.071 --> 43:15.973
Hey, Dad.

43:15.975 --> 43:18.109
Where did you get all the fancy clothes?

43:18.111 --> 43:21.446
At Armani, they're nice, right?

43:21.448 --> 43:23.714
With the way things are going...

43:23.716 --> 43:25.917
we're not gonna have to worry
about anything ever again.

43:25.919 --> 43:28.218
- I'm gonna set you up.
- You're gonna set me up?

43:28.220 --> 43:29.220
Yeah.

43:29.222 --> 43:30.187
BBC is really taking off.

43:30.189 --> 43:34.091
I'm going to get you out of this shit hole.

43:34.093 --> 43:36.227
I thought that the one good
thing I did in my life was to

43:36.229 --> 43:37.861
get you an quality education.

43:37.863 --> 43:39.863
So you can have a better life than me.

43:39.865 --> 43:41.866
But had I known that you were
going to emulate these people

43:41.868 --> 43:45.502
that think they are better than us.

43:45.504 --> 43:48.071
Joe, it's my experience
that if you are honest

43:48.073 --> 43:49.741
in business, things don't happen this fast.

43:49.743 --> 43:51.412
You worry too much.

44:01.521 --> 44:05.758
Dude, this suit is lethal.

44:09.129 --> 44:13.531
Joe, gold was down 15 percent at the bell.

44:13.533 --> 44:15.301
It'll correct.

44:17.102 --> 44:19.236
What do you mean the installers broke it!

44:19.238 --> 44:21.939
- I'm sorry...
- Just get out of my sight!

44:21.941 --> 44:23.343
Now!

44:55.508 --> 44:58.308
You look beautiful.

44:58.310 --> 44:59.912
Hardly.

45:02.948 --> 45:04.885
Nice suit.

45:07.153 --> 45:08.886
Look, if you ever want
to be taken seriously...

45:08.888 --> 45:11.589
in the art world, you'll run.

45:11.591 --> 45:13.357
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Sydney.

45:13.359 --> 45:16.227
Seriously, you are going to
let this guy bring you down?

45:16.229 --> 45:17.261
This guy?

45:17.263 --> 45:18.529
Look at his glasses.

45:18.531 --> 45:20.531
He looks like Clark Kent on Quaaludes.

45:20.533 --> 45:24.334
They are very fashionable glasses.

45:24.336 --> 45:27.138
Seriously, Sydney.

45:27.140 --> 45:30.174
How many people would be here
tonight, if it wasn't for you?

45:30.176 --> 45:35.212
How many of these ideas, did he run by you?

45:35.214 --> 45:37.216
He's lucky to have you.

45:39.051 --> 45:40.386
So lucky...

45:42.055 --> 45:44.223
Come on, let's go fix this thing.

45:51.430 --> 45:53.466
I think I got it.

46:07.881 --> 46:10.046
You didn't have to stay.

46:10.048 --> 46:12.183
You kidding me, this is rad.

47:09.042 --> 47:12.176
This is our ticket to
the deal of the century.

47:12.178 --> 47:14.377
It was originally built
for gold, but Joe thinks...

47:14.379 --> 47:16.948
we make a fortune using
it in the energy sector.

47:16.950 --> 47:20.350
So there's a company in
Chicago, it's called Cogenco.

47:20.352 --> 47:22.386
They turn oil-burning furnaces into coal.

47:22.388 --> 47:24.020
But they are in Chapter 11...

47:24.022 --> 47:26.457
because they still haven't
figured out how to grind it.

47:26.459 --> 47:30.127
So you want to use a gold mill for coal?

47:30.129 --> 47:34.332
This deal, is worth a quarter
of a billion dollars...

47:34.334 --> 47:36.466
in the first three years.

47:36.468 --> 47:39.303
And we are using your money to buy it.

47:39.305 --> 47:41.604
Told ya, Ron, Joe is a genius.

47:41.606 --> 47:42.805
Yeah, I know you told me, Dean.

47:42.807 --> 47:45.109
But it is a forgone conclusion
that everything you say...

47:45.111 --> 47:46.613
is completely full of shit.

47:52.618 --> 47:54.384
Is that the bouncer?

47:54.386 --> 47:56.220
That is my new bodyguard.

47:56.222 --> 47:57.520
Why do you need a bodyguard?

47:57.522 --> 47:59.689
Exactly what we want each share-holder

47:59.691 --> 48:01.359
to wonder when we walk in.

48:01.361 --> 48:03.026
Tim, it's good to see you!

48:03.028 --> 48:04.330
Good to be seen.

48:06.298 --> 48:09.500
<i>Cogenco had big debts,
$3 million worth.</i>

48:09.502 --> 48:12.703
<i>We agreed to pay them off using
Ron's money and in exchange</i>

48:12.705 --> 48:15.673
<i>the board agreed to sell us
the company and merge it.</i>

48:15.675 --> 48:18.075
<i>All we had to do now...</i>

48:18.077 --> 48:19.209
Ladies and gentlemen.

48:19.211 --> 48:20.745
<i>...convince the shareholders.</i>

48:20.747 --> 48:26.783
I stand before you today with a proposal.

48:26.785 --> 48:28.586
So what's the question?

48:28.588 --> 48:33.390
The 1,000-pound elephant in this room...

48:33.392 --> 48:36.493
is 'how old are these
boys?' Well let me tell ya.

48:36.495 --> 48:39.029
I'm 24.

48:39.031 --> 48:41.564
My Chief Operating Officer, Dean Karny.

48:41.566 --> 48:43.299
He's 25.

48:43.301 --> 48:47.238
In fact, there isn't a single
member of BBC Consolidated...

48:47.240 --> 48:50.473
that's over the age of 30.

48:50.475 --> 48:52.075
And that should scare you.

48:52.077 --> 48:54.678
You're damn right it does.

48:54.680 --> 49:00.683
Because you have no clue how
we solved in a matter of months

49:00.685 --> 49:06.524
what 10 years of R&D has
landed you $3 million in debt

49:06.526 --> 49:09.459
and one vote away from bankruptcy.

49:09.461 --> 49:12.129
Inaction right now will render you extinct!

49:12.131 --> 49:18.071
But guts right now will make you rich!

49:20.238 --> 49:21.638
The choice is yours.

49:21.640 --> 49:27.144
<i>Three hours after
walking into that room...</i>

49:27.146 --> 49:29.479
<i>we left with a deal
for two corporations...</i>

49:29.481 --> 49:31.515
<i>twelve million in stock options...</i>

49:31.517 --> 49:34.819
<i>and patents worth a
quarter billion dollars.</i>

49:34.821 --> 49:38.154
<i>Fuck Google. Fuck
Facebook. Fuck them all!</i>

49:38.156 --> 49:40.424
<i>We were the first.</i>

49:40.426 --> 49:43.461
This house was inspired by Richard Myren.

49:43.463 --> 49:45.229
Three bedrooms, two baths.

49:45.231 --> 49:48.866
It can be rented unfurnished
or fully furnished...

49:48.868 --> 49:50.537
that's up to you.

49:55.607 --> 49:58.375
What are we doing here?

49:58.377 --> 49:59.613
What do you think, Dean?

50:05.151 --> 50:06.883
We owe disbursements to everyone...

50:06.885 --> 50:08.785
and no one is reinvesting.

50:08.787 --> 50:09.921
How can we afford this place?

50:09.923 --> 50:13.457
Ron is wiring us our half
of the profits next week.

50:13.459 --> 50:18.464
Then we own Congenco and
a deal worth $250 million.

50:21.868 --> 50:23.437
Wow.

50:26.472 --> 50:28.471
Remember when you said
you wanted to get me...

50:28.473 --> 50:31.274
out of the valley, Dean.

50:31.276 --> 50:33.213
Yeah.

50:36.682 --> 50:39.852
Don't tell me you don't want to
wake up to this every morning.

50:51.731 --> 50:53.663
Do you realize the kind of whales...

50:53.665 --> 50:56.600
we can reel in with this place?

50:56.602 --> 51:00.370
This place legitimizes
us on the ultimate level.

51:00.372 --> 51:03.174
A couple of turntables by the jacuzzi.

51:03.176 --> 51:06.776
Paint that pool purple and this
place goes off like an ICBM.

51:06.778 --> 51:11.182
And you, my friend, can say
goodbye to Mean Dean forever.

51:11.184 --> 51:13.783
I hate that fucking name.

51:30.870 --> 51:32.368
But, Ron, the check still hasn't landed.

51:32.370 --> 51:33.803
Oh, that's strange, they were wiring it...

51:33.805 --> 51:34.971
from New York this week.

51:34.973 --> 51:37.341
I'll have to call Frank on Monday.

51:37.343 --> 51:40.644
Listen, it's been a month
and I need the money.

51:40.646 --> 51:42.779
I'm in hot water, okay.

51:42.781 --> 51:44.247
I spread myself thin with this place...

51:44.249 --> 51:46.216
and the office and Congenco.

51:46.218 --> 51:47.551
And I've sort of been...

51:47.553 --> 51:51.287
Diverting investments to pay expenses.

51:51.289 --> 51:56.227
Yes. Wait, you knew?

51:56.229 --> 51:57.428
Joe, I'm from Wall Street.

51:57.430 --> 52:02.265
Do you think people really
get rich playing by the rules?

52:02.267 --> 52:04.535
Now open the door.

52:04.537 --> 52:05.769

52:05.771 --> 52:08.538

52:30.263 --> 52:32.529
<i>Our Christmas party
would be talked of...</i>

52:32.531 --> 52:35.598
<i>written about and remembered
for decades to come.</i>

52:35.600 --> 52:40.937
<i>We weren't just players.
We were untouchable.</i>

52:40.939 --> 52:43.774
It looks like the parking
lot of a Dead show.

52:43.776 --> 52:46.776
Let's do some acid!

52:52.651 --> 52:54.752
Charlie! You've gotta meet this guy.

52:54.754 --> 52:58.321
This is the next Michelangelo.
This man is an artist.

52:58.323 --> 52:59.455
Hey, I'm Mark.

52:59.457 --> 53:03.026
Yeah, Mark Mahunny, don't be modest.

53:03.028 --> 53:05.495
- What are you, like a painter?
- Plastic surgeon.

53:05.497 --> 53:08.299
He is doing my tits!

53:08.301 --> 53:09.500
Look I don't want to be a downer...

53:09.502 --> 53:12.339
but our Dad's up our ass the
account disbursement checks.

53:13.872 --> 53:17.073
I got something better for you. All right!

53:17.075 --> 53:19.345
It is secret Santa time!

53:23.082 --> 53:25.515
Gentlemen?

53:25.517 --> 53:27.917
Here, open your envelopes.

53:27.919 --> 53:29.953
Profit sharing wasn't just a pitch.

53:29.955 --> 53:33.424
You boys remember when
I said this is our thing?

53:33.426 --> 53:37.361
That's your share in the BBC.

53:37.363 --> 53:39.363
Okay, so what are these...

53:39.365 --> 53:41.365
- Worth?
- Yeah?

53:41.367 --> 53:46.305
Your shares are worth 500!

53:47.506 --> 53:49.372
Holy fucking shit!

53:49.374 --> 53:53.412
No, no, wait, this is
fucking Biltmore money!

53:55.347 --> 53:57.448
This is your money.

53:57.450 --> 53:58.848
Thank you for believing in me.

53:58.850 --> 54:00.783
Give me a fucking kiss!

54:00.785 --> 54:06.490
Wait! Wait! I can't stand it anymore!

54:06.492 --> 54:09.428
Open
sez-a-me!

54:12.631 --> 54:15.131
Holy fucking shit!

54:15.133 --> 54:17.033
It's a Rolex!

54:17.035 --> 54:18.801
Two months ago I told you
to think big and tonight...

54:18.803 --> 54:21.939
you stand before me as giants and frankly

54:21.941 --> 54:25.908
I'm a little humbled, and
that is pretty fucking rare.

54:25.910 --> 54:29.011
So proud to be a part of it!

54:46.131 --> 54:49.066
Joe. Joe...

54:49.068 --> 54:50.700
You meet the guy wearing the fez?

54:50.702 --> 54:53.970
That guy is a real-life prince.

54:53.972 --> 54:55.705
So is every Persian in L.A.

54:55.707 --> 55:00.042
No, really, his dad is like
the Sham's minister of oil.

55:00.044 --> 55:01.178
He means Minister to the Shah...

55:01.180 --> 55:04.080
Joe, Joe, what you have
here at the BBC is stunning.

55:04.082 --> 55:09.019
It's so good. It's like
a fucking family, man!

55:09.021 --> 55:10.821
<i>Izzy was Charlie's friend.</i>

55:10.823 --> 55:12.855
<i>They met one summer in Greece.</i>

55:12.857 --> 55:15.691
<i>Like most Beverly Hills kids,
Izzy hated his father...</i>

55:15.693 --> 55:16.826
<i>but he had good reason.</i>

55:16.828 --> 55:20.997
<i>His dad was literally
a world-class asshole.</i>

55:20.999 --> 55:22.866
<i>He was wanted by
Iranian Intelligence...</i>

55:22.868 --> 55:24.767
<i>and was on the FBI watch list.</i>

55:24.769 --> 55:26.937
- Okay, time to go home.
- Okay, okay.

55:26.939 --> 55:28.971
Somebody put this guy in a cab.

55:28.973 --> 55:30.577
Bye. Bye, Charlie.

55:31.676 --> 55:33.576
Bye!

55:33.578 --> 55:35.678
In you go, Izzy.

55:35.680 --> 55:38.649
Joe, I'm serious, I want to join the BBC.

55:38.651 --> 55:41.451
Come to San Francisco and meet my father.

55:41.453 --> 55:43.086
He's a very wealthy man.

55:43.088 --> 55:45.024
Okay, Izzy, we'll talk soon.

55:55.767 --> 55:59.035
Can't believe you're
leaving me at Christmas.

55:59.037 --> 56:01.037
What's London got that I don't got?

56:01.039 --> 56:02.441
Hmm?

56:04.209 --> 56:05.878
Snow.

56:08.247 --> 56:12.115
Oh, there's plenty of that here. Huh?

56:12.117 --> 56:14.521
There we go.

56:17.957 --> 56:19.823
You're such an idiot.

56:19.825 --> 56:24.928
I am a charming handsome lovely
idiot that you cannot resist.

56:24.930 --> 56:26.696
You know that's empty right?

56:26.698 --> 56:28.801
No...

56:32.203 --> 56:35.707
Go on then. Go home.

56:45.184 --> 56:47.854
Uh-uh-uh...
patience.

56:53.926 --> 56:57.995
Now, have you been a good boy this year?

56:57.997 --> 57:00.897
Yeah, very.

57:00.899 --> 57:03.633
I find that hard to believe.

57:03.635 --> 57:05.137
I know.

57:09.207 --> 57:13.245
Hey, I love you, too.

57:24.222 --> 57:29.158
Whoa. What is that?

57:29.160 --> 57:31.328
Nineteen sixty two, Derringer four barrel.

57:31.330 --> 57:34.798
I found it at the Costa Mesa
gun show for two hundred bucks.

57:34.800 --> 57:38.569
Restored, thing's worth ten grand.

57:38.571 --> 57:41.941
See, Dean? Even my body
guard is an entrepreneur.

57:46.578 --> 57:48.548
Ryan, get me Frank Piedmont.

57:50.582 --> 57:51.714
<i>Hello?</i>

57:51.716 --> 57:54.350
Hey Frank, it is Joe Hunt.

57:54.352 --> 57:57.254
Just calling about that
final disbursement check.

57:57.256 --> 57:59.355
Ron's bank in New York still
hasn't received it from you.

57:59.357 --> 58:00.756
Disbursement?

58:00.758 --> 58:02.658
You did send it, right?

58:02.660 --> 58:04.664
Okay, wait. Is this a part of the story?

58:11.069 --> 58:12.269
What story?

58:12.271 --> 58:14.738
The story, Joe.

58:14.740 --> 58:16.772
Joe, what's he talking about?

58:16.774 --> 58:19.075
What story, Frank?

58:19.077 --> 58:21.580
<i>Are you messing with me?</i>

58:23.082 --> 58:24.881
Does it sound like I'm messing with you?

58:24.883 --> 58:28.919
Joe, listen, Ron told me he was
a producer for network news...

58:28.921 --> 58:31.154
doing an expose on your gold system.

58:31.156 --> 58:35.225
He got me to issue
statements on a phony account.

58:35.227 --> 58:37.861
<i>And that's the day bombs dropped.</i>

58:37.863 --> 58:39.261
Phony?

58:39.263 --> 58:41.698
Yeah, the money was not even real.

58:41.700 --> 58:43.265
Phony? What's phony?

58:43.267 --> 58:44.968
It was all part of the story.

58:44.970 --> 58:47.136
He had a camera crew in my office...

58:47.138 --> 58:49.138
filming me during our first call.

58:49.140 --> 58:50.973
What do you think?

58:50.975 --> 58:53.377
<i>Turns out Frank wasn't
Ron's broker at all.</i>

58:53.379 --> 58:55.645
<i>He thought Ron was a
network news reporter...</i>

58:55.647 --> 58:58.247
<i>doing a story on investing.</i>

58:58.249 --> 59:01.218
I'm the only one who knew there
is no money in that account.

59:01.220 --> 59:03.986
Stay on the line, Joe.

59:03.988 --> 59:05.921
<i>Ron conned him into
pretending the account...</i>

59:05.923 --> 59:09.058
<i>was real, so that he could use
it to get a $1.5 million...</i>

59:09.060 --> 59:11.361
<i>bank loan from somebody else.</i>

59:11.363 --> 59:13.964
14.4 million in cash?

59:13.966 --> 59:17.366
In an account at Thorton Brokerage?

59:17.368 --> 59:19.368
How long will the approval take?

59:19.370 --> 59:20.973
Won't take long at all.

59:29.247 --> 59:30.381
Joe?

59:30.383 --> 59:32.214
<i>Ron was big time, all right.</i>

59:32.216 --> 59:35.185
<i>Big time con man.</i>

59:35.187 --> 59:40.790
But if you perform on the
account I just handed you.

59:40.792 --> 59:42.792
I invest in relationships.

59:42.794 --> 59:44.294
People not stock.

59:44.296 --> 59:45.995
Joe, I'm from Wall Street.

59:45.997 --> 59:48.400
Do you think people really
get rich playing by the rules?

59:52.805 --> 59:54.073
Joe!

59:56.207 --> 01:00:00.444
You're never gonna believe
what happened today!

01:00:00.446 --> 01:00:03.383
Joe, my pieces are gonna be in a show.

01:00:06.785 --> 01:00:07.917
What's wrong?

01:00:07.919 --> 01:00:09.486
Ron Levin burnt me down, Syd.

01:00:09.488 --> 01:00:11.321
What?

01:00:11.323 --> 01:00:14.223
There wasn't ever any money in the account.

01:00:14.225 --> 01:00:16.292
Why would he do that?

01:00:16.294 --> 01:00:18.296
Because, he's a hustler.

01:00:23.468 --> 01:00:25.303
Just like me.

01:00:27.238 --> 01:00:29.071
Look at this.

01:00:29.073 --> 01:00:31.908
Tim has a friend at the LAPD.

01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:34.444
Ron is under Federal
indictment in three states.

01:00:34.446 --> 01:00:41.051
For bank violations, larceny,
check kiting, and postal fraud.

01:00:41.053 --> 01:00:42.953
Postal fraud!

01:00:42.955 --> 01:00:44.988
I am such an idiot!

01:00:44.990 --> 01:00:47.256
You know how much money I put
into Congenco at this point!

01:00:47.258 --> 01:00:49.258
Everything! And now it's fucked!

01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:52.863
I am such a fucking idiot!
Fucker! An idiot! Mother fucker!

01:00:52.865 --> 01:00:54.363
Joe, Joe, stop, stop, you're
gonna hurt yourself. Stop!

01:00:54.365 --> 01:00:57.299
Sydney, look around! Look
at this house, and the car!

01:00:57.301 --> 01:00:59.836
And my office! Is all
gone without Ron's money!

01:00:59.838 --> 01:01:01.404
I'm fucked!

01:01:01.406 --> 01:01:04.377
Okay, just calm down.

01:01:11.216 --> 01:01:15.185
I don't understand. He gave me a Rolex.

01:01:15.187 --> 01:01:18.223
It's the nicest gift
anyone's ever given me.

01:01:20.959 --> 01:01:23.459
It's ticking.

01:01:23.461 --> 01:01:25.731
The second hand on a Rolex sweeps.

01:01:27.533 --> 01:01:29.935
It's a fake.

01:01:32.571 --> 01:01:35.037
What if we just leave town for a while?

01:01:35.039 --> 01:01:37.040
Just while this all blows over.

01:01:37.042 --> 01:01:39.008
Syd, I can't just leave town.

01:01:39.010 --> 01:01:41.444
I owe a lot of money to a lot of people.

01:01:41.446 --> 01:01:44.446
Real people.

01:01:44.448 --> 01:01:49.285
Retirement plans, and college funds.

01:01:49.287 --> 01:01:52.524
I need to pay them back.

01:02:04.403 --> 01:02:06.506
Beautiful. Okay.

01:02:10.843 --> 01:02:12.308
Ron!

01:02:12.310 --> 01:02:14.513
Oh, no, he's fine.

01:02:16.314 --> 01:02:17.848
We need to talk.

01:02:17.850 --> 01:02:20.015
Nicholas, meet my broker, Joe Hunt.

01:02:20.017 --> 01:02:22.051
Spending some of our money, Joe?

01:02:22.053 --> 01:02:23.319
Looks like a perfect fit.

01:02:23.321 --> 01:02:25.321
Well, I wouldn't expect
anything but the best.

01:02:25.323 --> 01:02:27.357
- Thank you, Nicholas.
- Thank you.

01:02:27.359 --> 01:02:28.859
- Network news?
- Oh.

01:02:28.861 --> 01:02:30.861
- You conned me.
- Ah, is that what you think?

01:02:30.863 --> 01:02:33.095
Yes, a phony bank account
with no money in it.

01:02:33.097 --> 01:02:34.564
An expose for sweeps week?

01:02:34.566 --> 01:02:37.102
You have been playing me this whole time?

01:02:40.171 --> 01:02:43.939
Did you ever believe in me?

01:02:43.941 --> 01:02:46.878
Yes, and yes.

01:02:49.013 --> 01:02:50.113
You know, Nicholas I don't think...

01:02:50.115 --> 01:02:51.314
these are gonna fit in my trunk.

01:02:51.316 --> 01:02:54.017
Why don't I come back next
week and try the smaller set.

01:02:54.019 --> 01:02:56.352
Look, there is a perfect
explanation for all of this.

01:02:56.354 --> 01:02:57.453
Okay, I'm all ears.

01:02:57.455 --> 01:02:58.555
Excuse me, Mr. Levin?

01:02:58.557 --> 01:03:00.892
Would you allow us to take
them outside and check?

01:03:03.327 --> 01:03:05.263
Well, if you insist.

01:03:07.932 --> 01:03:09.933
Oh shoot, I was right.

01:03:09.935 --> 01:03:13.169
So close. Well, why don't we go ahead...

01:03:13.171 --> 01:03:14.904
and try the smaller set
while we're out here.

01:03:14.906 --> 01:03:16.506
Excellent idea, Mr. Levin.

01:03:16.508 --> 01:03:19.508
Give us one moment, we'll
be right back. Thank you.

01:03:19.510 --> 01:03:22.946
You can do anything in Beverly
Hills with a Rolex and a Rolls.

01:03:22.948 --> 01:03:25.518
Fake Rolex, Ron?

01:03:27.551 --> 01:03:29.586
Swing by the house, Joe.

01:03:29.588 --> 01:03:31.354
I'll explain everything.

01:03:31.356 --> 01:03:33.355
It's not nearly as sordid as you think.

01:03:33.357 --> 01:03:37.294
Oh and Joe... do me a favor.

01:03:37.296 --> 01:03:40.466
Tip Edwardo for me.

01:03:44.169 --> 01:03:47.203
What do you mean, Ron's
burned us? Where is the money?

01:03:47.205 --> 01:03:49.205
It was never there in the first place.

01:03:49.207 --> 01:03:52.308
No, wait. What about the shares? Huh?

01:03:52.310 --> 01:03:54.209
BBC's finished, Kyle.

01:03:54.211 --> 01:03:56.345
You know, I can just see the
look on my old man's face now.

01:03:56.347 --> 01:03:58.348
Yeah, no shit.

01:03:58.350 --> 01:04:00.519
God, I just want to squash that bug.

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:05.057
Maybe we should.

01:04:06.325 --> 01:04:08.261
Should what?

01:04:10.261 --> 01:04:12.962
Fuck him up.

01:04:12.964 --> 01:04:15.464
Well, he's con man. What's
he gonna do? Go to the cops?

01:04:15.466 --> 01:04:18.037
Yeah, seriously.

01:04:19.705 --> 01:04:21.705
What would you guys do alone
in a room with Ron Levin?

01:04:21.707 --> 01:04:25.475
What would you do to make
him give us our money back?

01:04:25.477 --> 01:04:27.009
What, hypothetically?

01:04:27.011 --> 01:04:29.245
Yeah.

01:04:29.247 --> 01:04:33.116
I say we bust in there,
we explain the situation!

01:04:33.118 --> 01:04:35.151
Yeah, with a gun; to his head.

01:04:35.153 --> 01:04:37.120
But put gloves on first.

01:04:37.122 --> 01:04:39.355
Tie that asshole to a chair,
pistol whip the fuck outta him.

01:04:39.357 --> 01:04:42.591
Tape his fucking mouth shut
so no one can hear him squeal.

01:04:42.593 --> 01:04:44.493
Torture the shit out of his dog.

01:04:44.495 --> 01:04:45.595
Twist his its fucking ear off.

01:04:45.597 --> 01:04:47.029
I hate that mutt.

01:04:47.031 --> 01:04:48.430
Kill it.

01:04:48.432 --> 01:04:50.700
Right in front of his face
so he'll piss his pants.

01:04:50.702 --> 01:04:52.701
You motherfuckers are crazy.

01:04:52.703 --> 01:04:54.640
Alright, what else?

01:04:56.774 --> 01:04:58.711
Dig a pit.

01:05:00.312 --> 01:05:03.145
What's worse for the BBC?

01:05:03.147 --> 01:05:04.113
Ron Levin out for revenge?

01:05:04.115 --> 01:05:06.281
Or Ron Levin in a pit
in the middle of nowhere?

01:05:06.283 --> 01:05:10.185
Hmm?

01:05:10.187 --> 01:05:12.057
Are we still talking hypothetical?

01:05:23.334 --> 01:05:26.304
I want you to scare the
living shit out of him, Tim.

01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:32.107
Ain't nothin' sketch a motherfucka...

01:05:32.109 --> 01:05:34.076
than cockin' that hammer back.

01:05:34.078 --> 01:05:36.078
You can't point an unloaded
revolver at someone.

01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:38.314
If he sees there's no
bullets in the chamber

01:05:38.316 --> 01:05:39.616
he's gonna know the gun's empty.

01:05:39.618 --> 01:05:41.354
Then we're fucked.

01:05:44.222 --> 01:05:45.758
Then we hit 'em with the Brown Betty.

01:05:54.098 --> 01:05:55.464
Just a minute.

01:05:55.466 --> 01:05:58.468
You stay here.

01:05:58.470 --> 01:05:59.638
Hey, Joe.

01:06:02.807 --> 01:06:04.040
I'm so glad you came. I knew you would.

01:06:04.042 --> 01:06:07.245
I wish you'd called first, but
I won't hold it against you.

01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:12.348
Ron, I haven't been
straight with you, okay?

01:06:12.350 --> 01:06:14.651
There are people in
Chicago who are after me.

01:06:14.653 --> 01:06:16.252
I told them about Frank,
and they lost it...

01:06:16.254 --> 01:06:17.787
and they said they were coming after you.

01:06:17.789 --> 01:06:19.855
What the fuck!

01:06:19.857 --> 01:06:22.392
Ron! Tell this guy right
now how you conned me!

01:06:22.394 --> 01:06:23.792
Christ! You son of a bitch!

01:06:23.794 --> 01:06:25.395
Tell him how you made money off me!

01:06:25.397 --> 01:06:28.198
- Jesus! Fuck you!
- Tell him!

01:06:29.533 --> 01:06:32.167
No! No! Put him down! No! Not Kosher! No!

01:06:33.305 --> 01:06:34.238
Where's the fucking money!

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:36.171
In the top drawer of the desk in there!

01:06:36.173 --> 01:06:38.076
Put him down, please! Put him down!

01:06:44.149 --> 01:06:46.381
I really hate to disappoint
you, but this is not the first...

01:06:46.383 --> 01:06:48.686
time I've been tied up
and had a gun in my face.

01:06:50.421 --> 01:06:56.426
You conned me for a bank loan?

01:06:56.428 --> 01:07:00.199
Wait, you think I used Frank to con you?

01:07:02.434 --> 01:07:05.336
I used you to con Frank.

01:07:07.506 --> 01:07:09.471
Wake up.

01:07:09.473 --> 01:07:11.410
It's called a convincer.

01:07:14.613 --> 01:07:15.578
Jesus.

01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:19.381
You know, you really don't scare me at all.

01:07:19.383 --> 01:07:20.517
Joe.

01:07:20.519 --> 01:07:22.218
Listen to me.

01:07:22.220 --> 01:07:23.319
You're a natural.

01:07:23.321 --> 01:07:25.888
You're born for this.

01:07:25.890 --> 01:07:28.357
You're just like me.

01:07:28.359 --> 01:07:30.359
My God, I can teach you so much.

01:07:30.361 --> 01:07:31.727
What did you say?

01:07:31.729 --> 01:07:34.296
It's gonna cost three
million to close Congenco?

01:07:34.298 --> 01:07:36.533
We'll make more than that in a month.

01:07:36.535 --> 01:07:38.801
And we won't have to split
it with fifteen people.

01:07:38.803 --> 01:07:41.171
You want to play in the big leagues?

01:07:41.173 --> 01:07:42.372
Do yourself a favor.

01:07:42.374 --> 01:07:45.642
Put the gun away, and get
on a plane with me tonight...

01:07:45.644 --> 01:07:47.209
and come to New York.

01:07:47.211 --> 01:07:53.183
And start working together
as we should, as partners.

01:07:53.185 --> 01:07:55.551
You want to be partners?

01:07:55.553 --> 01:07:57.490
Of course.

01:08:03.794 --> 01:08:04.829
Put the gun down.

01:08:09.267 --> 01:08:12.602
All right, let's start right now.

01:08:12.604 --> 01:08:15.305
Cut me in on my half of the bank loan.

01:08:15.307 --> 01:08:16.872
Okay.

01:08:16.874 --> 01:08:18.810
Here's the check.

01:08:25.617 --> 01:08:28.585
That was easy. Just ask next time.

01:08:28.587 --> 01:08:31.286
You can untie me now.

01:08:31.287 --> 01:08:33.622
Looks real alright.

01:08:33.624 --> 01:08:36.162
Oh my God.

01:08:40.397 --> 01:08:43.366
Tim! You brought the door man!

01:08:43.368 --> 01:08:47.804
I... I got him his job. You
probably didn't know that.

01:08:47.805 --> 01:08:49.973
I fucking vouched for you with Wolfgang.

01:08:49.975 --> 01:08:53.542
Are you fucking kidding me?
This is like a joke, right?

01:08:53.544 --> 01:08:56.946
Are you really that low life?
You brought the door man?

01:08:56.948 --> 01:08:58.747
Oh, I'm sorry, he's your body guard.

01:08:58.749 --> 01:09:00.782
You know what? Maybe I'm wrong about you.

01:09:00.783 --> 01:09:04.953
Maybe you are just a low life,
two-bit hustler from the valley.

01:09:04.955 --> 01:09:07.523
And what are you? A schwartze on a leash!

01:09:07.524 --> 01:09:09.595
Why don't tell this ape
to get his fucking...

01:09:12.662 --> 01:09:16.566
What the fuck, Tim! You
were supposed to scare him!

01:09:16.568 --> 01:09:18.401
Why are there bullets in the gun!

01:09:18.403 --> 01:09:21.207
We gotta draw a line.

01:09:23.841 --> 01:09:25.407
You were gonna partner with this guy?

01:09:25.408 --> 01:09:28.478
No! I was just saying
that to get the money!

01:09:28.479 --> 01:09:31.046
Oops.

01:09:38.288 --> 01:09:40.389
Your father fell in love with a Geisha.

01:09:40.390 --> 01:09:43.725
She was a tea service girl.

01:09:43.727 --> 01:09:44.893
Yeah, it was fun.

01:09:44.895 --> 01:09:46.461
Enough about us.

01:09:46.462 --> 01:09:50.867
Tell us about you and this
boy, who's 45 minutes late.

01:09:50.868 --> 01:09:53.635
He... he's never late.

01:09:53.636 --> 01:09:55.807
Oh, there he is.

01:09:57.074 --> 01:09:58.840
Joe...

01:09:58.842 --> 01:10:00.843
Hi. This is Joe.

01:10:00.845 --> 01:10:02.444
Hey, Joe.

01:10:02.446 --> 01:10:07.884
So sorry I'm late. Traffic...
Los Angeles traffic.

01:10:07.886 --> 01:10:10.256
Happens to the best of us. Right?

01:10:12.324 --> 01:10:15.590
So, Syd tells us that you are in finance?

01:10:15.592 --> 01:10:18.861
Any chance you are related to
the Hunt Brothers out of Dallas?

01:10:18.863 --> 01:10:20.830
I don't think so.

01:10:20.832 --> 01:10:23.465
Well, it is a shame.

01:10:23.467 --> 01:10:25.401
You know I met Nelson
a couple of years ago.

01:10:25.403 --> 01:10:27.703
He is a real character.

01:10:27.705 --> 01:10:30.406
Where're you from, Joe?

01:10:30.408 --> 01:10:31.506
Van Nuys.

01:10:31.508 --> 01:10:35.711
Hmm. Are your parents still there?

01:10:35.713 --> 01:10:37.779
I'm sorry?

01:10:37.781 --> 01:10:39.717
Your parents, are they still in the valley?

01:10:42.954 --> 01:10:45.755
My father is, yeah, yeah. My mother's not.

01:10:45.757 --> 01:10:46.923
She... I don't know where she is.

01:10:46.925 --> 01:10:49.395
She is in Santa Barbara sometimes, maybe.

01:10:51.061 --> 01:10:53.028
Should we order more drinks?

01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:55.630
I could go for another martini.

01:10:55.632 --> 01:10:57.966
How about a bottle of wine?

01:10:57.968 --> 01:11:00.469
Joe, red or white?

01:11:00.471 --> 01:11:04.741
Oh, he doesn't drink. So,
whatever you want, Daddy.

01:11:04.743 --> 01:11:06.142
- Are you in A.A?
- Mom.

01:11:06.144 --> 01:11:10.045
- What?
- He just doesn't drink.

01:11:10.047 --> 01:11:11.716
I really could use some water.

01:11:13.685 --> 01:11:15.721
Here, just drink mine. Joe, here.

01:11:20.725 --> 01:11:23.725
Joe, you have something on your collar.

01:11:23.727 --> 01:11:24.926
- What?
- Momma.

01:11:24.928 --> 01:11:27.833
Your collar? Is that blood?

01:11:30.534 --> 01:11:34.836
Ahh... I was shaving...
and I must have cut myself.

01:11:34.838 --> 01:11:37.105
- Let me see.
- No, it's nothing.

01:11:37.107 --> 01:11:38.474
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. Yeah, everything's...

01:11:38.476 --> 01:11:41.676
What's wrong? Joe, please...

01:11:41.678 --> 01:11:44.813
Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Evans, welcome back.

01:11:44.815 --> 01:11:46.081
Dean, how are you?

01:11:46.083 --> 01:11:47.649
You've been in Europe
for a few months, right?

01:11:47.651 --> 01:11:49.551
We were in Japan. Just got back.

01:11:49.553 --> 01:11:51.853
Hey, Charlie.

01:11:51.855 --> 01:11:54.724
Oh, Charles, how are your parents?

01:11:54.726 --> 01:11:56.091
Are they still traveling?

01:11:56.093 --> 01:11:58.460
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. They're good.

01:11:58.462 --> 01:12:00.732
Excuse me.

01:12:02.934 --> 01:12:04.700
I just remembered I have
a new client meeting.

01:12:04.702 --> 01:12:05.835
What?

01:12:05.837 --> 01:12:07.769
It was such pleasure to
meet you Mr. and Mrs. Evans.

01:12:07.771 --> 01:12:11.843
Joe. Joe. Joe. Joe!

01:12:15.814 --> 01:12:20.081
Client meeting... I completely forgot.

01:12:20.083 --> 01:12:23.185
- I should go.
- Yeah, yeah, no worries.

01:12:23.187 --> 01:12:25.720
I'm sorry, Dad.

01:12:25.722 --> 01:12:28.627
Darling, he is not a keeper.

01:12:34.731 --> 01:12:38.067
Joe! Are you okay?

01:12:38.069 --> 01:12:40.138
Huh?

01:12:44.676 --> 01:12:46.044
What happened?

01:12:50.181 --> 01:12:53.049
It didn't go according to plan.

01:12:53.051 --> 01:12:55.687
You killed him?

01:12:59.524 --> 01:13:02.825
Hey, hey, look at me. Look at me.

01:13:02.827 --> 01:13:08.497
Fuck Ron. He was a snake and
he got what was coming to him.

01:13:08.499 --> 01:13:10.636
You did what you had to do.
You did the right thing, Joe!

01:13:12.270 --> 01:13:15.174
You did what had to be done.

01:13:16.975 --> 01:13:20.009
Fuckin' come here. We
can still cash his check.

01:13:20.011 --> 01:13:23.011
No one knows he's dead.

01:13:23.013 --> 01:13:24.179
You fucking saved us.

01:13:24.181 --> 01:13:25.715
Hey guys!

01:13:25.717 --> 01:13:28.917
They don't know. No handcuffs, no blood.

01:13:28.919 --> 01:13:31.152
Fucking Ron invested in
Congenco and he went to New York.

01:13:31.154 --> 01:13:32.889
- That's what happened. That's it.
- Okay.

01:13:32.891 --> 01:13:34.790
Right?

01:13:34.792 --> 01:13:36.559
Hey, hey.

01:13:36.561 --> 01:13:38.294
- Dude.
- Where's he going?

01:13:38.296 --> 01:13:40.062
He's gotta go meet this client.
It's a last minute thing.

01:13:40.064 --> 01:13:41.964
He doesn't need me though. We're
gonna go inside and get a drink.

01:13:41.966 --> 01:13:43.698
I'll tell you about it
inside. Come on, let's go in.

01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:45.770
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
We'll see you later, brother.

01:14:09.860 --> 01:14:12.894
Hey, you wanna give me a hand here?

01:14:12.896 --> 01:14:14.867
Not really.

01:14:16.633 --> 01:14:18.203
Let 'em go.

01:14:21.105 --> 01:14:23.205
Careful with this stuff.
Don't get creative.

01:14:23.207 --> 01:14:25.174
Just get it on his face.

01:14:48.065 --> 01:14:50.702
Syd, you awake?

01:15:08.019 --> 01:15:09.684
<i>Until Ron's check cleared...</i>

01:15:09.686 --> 01:15:11.886
<i>we were dead in the</i> water.

01:15:11.888 --> 01:15:13.923
<i>Desperate for cash.</i>

01:15:13.925 --> 01:15:15.358
<i>Investors were starting
to get anxious.</i>

01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:18.193
<i>And they were still expecting
their fifty percent returns.</i>

01:15:18.195 --> 01:15:21.363
The pool has run dry, and we need cash now.

01:15:21.365 --> 01:15:24.666
Once Ron Levin's check clears, we're fine!

01:15:24.668 --> 01:15:27.335
Barely scratches the surface!

01:15:27.337 --> 01:15:29.738
If the BBC craters, every
document from the past year...

01:15:29.740 --> 01:15:33.075
will be under the microscope
of the IRS and the SEC.

01:15:33.077 --> 01:15:37.045
And when they find Ron
Levin's name, the FBI.

01:15:37.047 --> 01:15:39.215
And when that happens? What
do you think they'll do?

01:15:39.217 --> 01:15:41.053
I don't know, Dean. What'll they do?

01:15:42.854 --> 01:15:46.121
Joe, they could arrest you for murder.

01:15:46.123 --> 01:15:50.026
How? They don't have a case.

01:15:50.028 --> 01:15:53.164
Not unless someone
breaks rank and testifies.

01:15:56.434 --> 01:15:58.434
You know me better than anybody, Joe.

01:15:58.436 --> 01:16:01.202
- Come on.
- Yeah.

01:16:01.204 --> 01:16:04.939
You know that. But I can't
speak for everybody else.

01:16:04.941 --> 01:16:09.444
Why do you think they call me "Mean Dean"?

01:16:09.446 --> 01:16:10.345
Why?

01:16:10.347 --> 01:16:12.113
Because you burned down the game room.

01:16:12.115 --> 01:16:13.749
I didn't burn shit!

01:16:13.751 --> 01:16:17.318
Jake Kastner stole those
fireworks and then fucked me...

01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:19.020
in the ass with a Roman candle.

01:16:19.022 --> 01:16:21.424
I was in the game room getting my foos on

01:16:21.426 --> 01:16:25.161
when all of a sudden he busts
in like a fire bug with a Zippo.

01:16:25.163 --> 01:16:28.130
Alarms are ringing, and I'm
like "Mr. Fox, I didn't do shit!"

01:16:28.132 --> 01:16:30.131
But nobody remembers it that way.

01:16:30.133 --> 01:16:32.637
Because he ran back to the
cabin like a little bit...

01:16:34.404 --> 01:16:35.706
Hey.

01:16:37.007 --> 01:16:38.242
Hi.

01:16:46.918 --> 01:16:49.952
He ran back to the cabins
and told everybody...

01:16:49.954 --> 01:16:51.319
that I burned down that room.

01:16:51.321 --> 01:16:53.659
That it was my idea.

01:16:55.359 --> 01:16:57.126
Do you see what I'm saying?

01:16:57.128 --> 01:16:59.094
You know the law as well as I do.

01:16:59.096 --> 01:17:00.261
First one in gets the deal and...

01:17:00.263 --> 01:17:03.499
Everyone else gets the shaft.

01:17:03.501 --> 01:17:07.204
So watch your back. That's all I'm saying.

01:17:24.254 --> 01:17:25.457
Joe.

01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:30.428
Ron Levin's check bounced.

01:17:35.065 --> 01:17:36.264
<i>That's when we reached out...</i>

01:17:36.266 --> 01:17:37.465
<i>to Charlie's friend Izzy.</i>

01:17:37.467 --> 01:17:41.437
<i>The Persian Prince from
the Christmas party.</i>

01:17:41.439 --> 01:17:43.872
<i>Izzy wanted into the BBC badly.</i>

01:17:43.874 --> 01:17:46.274
<i>He told us that his father
could get us financing...</i>

01:17:46.276 --> 01:17:48.277
<i>from his filthy,
rich friends in L.A.</i>

01:17:48.279 --> 01:17:50.246
<i>if we did the old man a favor.</i>

01:17:50.248 --> 01:17:52.081
How well do we actually know this guy?

01:17:52.083 --> 01:17:54.082
- Shh.
- He's connected.

01:17:54.084 --> 01:17:56.352
<i>Izzy said that his dad
was being watched...</i>

01:17:56.354 --> 01:17:58.821
<i>because of what a big
shot he was in Iran.</i>

01:17:58.823 --> 01:18:00.822
His fortune is tied up in foreign accounts.

01:18:00.824 --> 01:18:03.224
But we think with the help
of our friend in L.A...

01:18:03.226 --> 01:18:04.794
we can recover the estate.

01:18:04.796 --> 01:18:05.960
Yeah.

01:18:05.962 --> 01:18:07.897
What is you and I were talking
about is that maybe we can

01:18:07.899 --> 01:18:09.130
find a way to sneak him down south.

01:18:09.132 --> 01:18:12.134
Get my father to Los Angeles, and we...

01:18:12.136 --> 01:18:15.837
guarantee a seven figure
investment into BBC.

01:18:15.839 --> 01:18:19.778
- A million bucks?
- Yeah, at least.

01:18:22.145 --> 01:18:23.912
<i>A month ago, we were negotiating...</i>

01:18:23.914 --> 01:18:25.581
<i>a billion dollar merger.</i>

01:18:25.583 --> 01:18:27.582
<i>Now, we were talking
about smuggling...</i>

01:18:27.584 --> 01:18:29.184
<i>an Iranian tyrant in a box.</i>

01:18:29.186 --> 01:18:30.419
- Yo, Charlie.
- Yeah?

01:18:30.421 --> 01:18:33.191
- If you see anything, honk twice.
- You got it.

01:18:41.399 --> 01:18:43.064
Hello, Mr. Samedi.

01:18:43.066 --> 01:18:45.067
Here it is, just like we discussed.

01:18:45.069 --> 01:18:48.603
So no one notices you leaving.

01:18:48.605 --> 01:18:51.876
This is just until we get
you out of San Francisco.

01:18:53.610 --> 01:18:56.144
Dad, this was our idea.

01:18:56.146 --> 01:18:58.283
See? Lots of space. Yeah, it'll be fine.

01:19:00.351 --> 01:19:01.453
What? Papa?

01:19:02.887 --> 01:19:05.086
Izzy, what the fuck is that?

01:19:05.088 --> 01:19:07.055
It's opium, Dean.

01:19:07.057 --> 01:19:08.225
Opium.

01:19:10.595 --> 01:19:12.327
Ismael...

01:19:12.329 --> 01:19:14.462
You expect me to get in there?

01:19:14.464 --> 01:19:17.032
Okay, you do you want to try it?

01:19:17.034 --> 01:19:19.100
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa! Sorry.

01:19:19.102 --> 01:19:23.007
Dad! To kill my one thing!

01:19:24.609 --> 01:19:26.341
These boys are idiots, just like you!

01:19:26.343 --> 01:19:27.412
Unbelievable.

01:19:40.357 --> 01:19:41.390
Well?

01:19:41.392 --> 01:19:43.893
Ah, he's changed his
mind. He doesn't wanna go.

01:19:43.895 --> 01:19:46.661
This little excursion
cost us fifteen grand.

01:19:46.663 --> 01:19:48.663
He is getting in the goddamn trunk.

01:19:48.665 --> 01:19:51.066
I've explained that to him,
Dean. He's not in the mood.

01:19:51.068 --> 01:19:52.300
Oh, so ah... you have explained it to him?

01:19:52.302 --> 01:19:53.568
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry, oh, okay.

01:19:53.570 --> 01:19:54.737
Maybe I need to explain it to him.

01:19:54.739 --> 01:19:57.907
Maybe I should explain it
to him the old fashion way.

01:19:57.909 --> 01:19:59.611
Shut the fuck up, Dean, listen...

01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:05.482
What the hell?

01:20:06.617 --> 01:20:08.253
Oh, god...

01:20:10.587 --> 01:20:12.056
Oh... fuck.

01:20:15.159 --> 01:20:17.259
<i>That key was to a
safety deposit box...</i>

01:20:17.261 --> 01:20:21.196
<i>in Beverly Hills, it was
the Persian's nest egg.</i>

01:20:21.198 --> 01:20:22.467
Now what?

01:20:25.136 --> 01:20:27.138
Put him in the trunk.

01:20:53.029 --> 01:20:56.197
Relax, if your dad jumps out,
Izzy, Tim and I gonna grab him.

01:20:56.199 --> 01:20:57.398
Okay?

01:20:57.400 --> 01:20:59.136
Hold down the box.

01:21:00.471 --> 01:21:01.906
- Okay, you ready?
- Yeah.

01:21:06.243 --> 01:21:08.013
He looks dead, Joe.

01:21:10.748 --> 01:21:12.581
No, he's got a pulse.

01:21:12.583 --> 01:21:14.683
Your dad ever overdose, Izzy?

01:21:14.685 --> 01:21:15.984
Yeah, once.

01:21:15.986 --> 01:21:18.620
He could be in a coma.

01:21:18.622 --> 01:21:20.621
Hey, Izzy.

01:21:20.623 --> 01:21:23.125
How much is in here?

01:21:23.127 --> 01:21:25.361
Five million.

01:21:25.363 --> 01:21:27.129
In diamonds.

01:21:27.131 --> 01:21:28.663
Shit...

01:21:28.665 --> 01:21:30.599
<i>Depending on who you ask...</i>

01:21:30.601 --> 01:21:34.303
<i>will determine how the
next part of story goes.</i>

01:21:34.305 --> 01:21:37.339
<i>Charlie says he was
in he car behind us.</i>

01:21:37.341 --> 01:21:39.343
<i>And I think Izzy said
he wasn't even there.</i>

01:21:42.379 --> 01:21:45.380
<i>And that leaves me versus Joe.</i>

01:21:45.382 --> 01:21:48.185
<i>Four friends with four very
different points of views.</i>

01:21:50.587 --> 01:21:54.355
Syd... hey. I need to talk to you, please.

01:21:54.357 --> 01:21:55.424
Joe, what's wrong?

01:21:55.426 --> 01:21:57.526
Leave town with me. Let
us just go, you and me.

01:21:57.528 --> 01:21:59.361
Okay? We can leave right now.
We can go wherever you want.

01:21:59.363 --> 01:22:00.496
Joe, my show is tonight.

01:22:00.498 --> 01:22:03.098
I know, I'm so happy for
you. I'm going to go home

01:22:03.100 --> 01:22:04.066
and I'll pack up our stuff...

01:22:04.068 --> 01:22:05.334
and we can take off right after the show.

01:22:05.336 --> 01:22:08.036
I don't think you understand,
I can't go anywhere with you!

01:22:08.038 --> 01:22:10.371
Sydney, I'm sorry, I've been
a shitty boyfriend, I know.

01:22:10.373 --> 01:22:12.140
But I love you. And I'm gonna make this...

01:22:12.142 --> 01:22:13.675
You have to let me make this up to you.

01:22:13.677 --> 01:22:16.678
When was the last time we
even had a real conversation?

01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:19.380
Everything's been off! Okay?
I... it's hard for me to explain.

01:22:19.382 --> 01:22:22.050
How can you not see how alone I am?

01:22:22.052 --> 01:22:24.685
I do! It's this town! It's this town.

01:22:24.687 --> 01:22:27.156
They build you up to tear you
down. You're never good enough.

01:22:27.158 --> 01:22:28.823
You know how hard it is to
keep my stories straight?

01:22:28.825 --> 01:22:29.791
What?

01:22:29.793 --> 01:22:30.992
The BBC is full of cash.
The BBC's flushed out.

01:22:30.994 --> 01:22:35.496
Ron Levin's gone to New York.
Ron Levin's gone for good!

01:22:35.498 --> 01:22:36.732
What are you talking about?

01:22:36.734 --> 01:22:38.503
What does that even mean, "Gone
for good?" Where's Ron Levin?

01:22:41.372 --> 01:22:45.573
You know what? I don't wanna know.

01:22:45.575 --> 01:22:47.643
Sydney, please.

01:22:47.645 --> 01:22:48.777
Can you please just give me another shot.

01:22:48.779 --> 01:22:50.578
- I have to go.
- Please? Sydney, I'm sorry.

01:22:50.580 --> 01:22:54.349
- Hey... stay.
- No, don't!

01:22:54.351 --> 01:22:55.754
Don't.

01:23:06.329 --> 01:23:08.096
So where have you been?

01:23:08.098 --> 01:23:09.798
I have people who just
showed up screaming for blood.

01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:11.703
I think it was Scott.

01:23:18.109 --> 01:23:19.707
- Fuck the money.
- What?

01:23:19.709 --> 01:23:21.078
- Fuck the money.
- No!

01:23:22.645 --> 01:23:25.115
I'm want to get outta here. Come on.

01:23:27.217 --> 01:23:31.786
Guys. Guys! Kyle, Scott! Come on, guys.

01:23:31.788 --> 01:23:33.755
- Where are you guys going?
- We're goin' home, dude.

01:23:33.757 --> 01:23:36.791
- BBC's falling apart.
- Falling apart?

01:23:36.793 --> 01:23:37.760
Come on, you guys have no balls!

01:23:37.762 --> 01:23:41.263
No, you have no brains!
And there's no money.

01:23:41.265 --> 01:23:44.133
This is bullshit. Our
Joe is fucking bullshit!

01:23:44.135 --> 01:23:46.734
This thing is ours. This thing is real!

01:23:46.736 --> 01:23:49.505
No, no, this thing is over.

01:23:49.507 --> 01:23:51.843
Come on.

01:23:53.511 --> 01:23:55.280
Look, guys.

01:23:57.280 --> 01:23:58.515
Oh, fuck.

01:24:55.672 --> 01:24:57.608
Sam?

01:25:02.846 --> 01:25:04.947
Where is Ismael?

01:25:04.949 --> 01:25:06.615
I'm gonna kill him.

01:25:06.617 --> 01:25:08.617
Joe!

01:25:19.462 --> 01:25:22.663
I got him, Joe!

01:25:25.569 --> 01:25:27.839
Agh!

01:25:30.708 --> 01:25:32.474
Dean, Dean, Dean, are you okay?

01:25:32.476 --> 01:25:35.277
- I'm not...
- It's okay.

01:25:35.279 --> 01:25:36.678
I gotta get some rope and tie this guy up.

01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:38.682
Joe. Don't go!

01:25:49.726 --> 01:25:51.762
Joe!

01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:39.508
We have to turn ourselves in.

01:26:39.510 --> 01:26:41.809
What, are you high?

01:26:41.811 --> 01:26:44.813
Look, he was trying to kill
you. Okay? It's self-defense.

01:26:44.815 --> 01:26:46.851
Yeah, because we kidnapped the guy.

01:26:48.785 --> 01:26:50.585
It was a snake, in the trunk...

01:26:50.587 --> 01:26:51.853
he had a seizure and he broke his neck.

01:26:51.855 --> 01:26:53.554
Nobody's gonna believe that, Joe.

01:26:53.556 --> 01:26:55.991
There's way too much evidence everywhere.

01:26:55.993 --> 01:26:58.093
Alright.

01:26:58.095 --> 01:26:59.827
Okay, how do we spin this?

01:26:59.829 --> 01:27:02.464
We dump the body in the desert.

01:27:02.466 --> 01:27:03.999
We forge that conservatorship.

01:27:04.001 --> 01:27:05.966
Izzy won't care as long
as he gets his money.

01:27:05.968 --> 01:27:08.769
He despised the guy.

01:27:08.771 --> 01:27:11.939
Otherwise this is kidnaping
with aggravated circumstances.

01:27:11.941 --> 01:27:15.544
Forget life without parole.
I'm looking at the gas chamber.

01:27:15.546 --> 01:27:20.415
We're looking at the gas chamber.

01:27:20.417 --> 01:27:22.352
Thanks, man.

01:27:35.031 --> 01:27:37.799
Don't you feel guilty?

01:27:37.801 --> 01:27:41.969
Guilty? For that sack of
shit? Who beat his family?

01:27:41.971 --> 01:27:46.476
Put the screws to his
whole country. Fuck no.

01:27:54.717 --> 01:27:57.118
I need to hold my head up, Dean.

01:27:57.120 --> 01:28:00.889
Instead of looking away in
denial for the rest of my life.

01:28:00.891 --> 01:28:05.760
No, no. Don't you dare
start freezing up on me now.

01:28:05.762 --> 01:28:08.162
Everything I've done,
I've for you, and the BBC.

01:28:08.164 --> 01:28:11.433
You promised me. You said
you would do anything for me

01:28:11.435 --> 01:28:13.434
and you would never let me down.

01:28:13.436 --> 01:28:14.969
Don't you dare start now.

01:28:14.971 --> 01:28:17.040
You are my best friend.

01:28:26.784 --> 01:28:28.017
Okay.

01:28:28.019 --> 01:28:32.453
Dean, go home, take a shower,
pound a bottle of Listerine.

01:28:32.455 --> 01:28:34.790
And meet me at the bank at 8:00 AM, okay?

01:28:34.792 --> 01:28:36.925
Don't tell Izzy what
happened to his father.

01:28:36.927 --> 01:28:38.626
Not until after we get the diamonds.

01:28:38.628 --> 01:28:39.894
Hey, we get those diamonds, Joe.

01:28:39.896 --> 01:28:41.897
We can forget any of this ever happened.

01:28:41.899 --> 01:28:49.603
Dean, we get the diamonds?
I'm paying back those loans.

01:28:49.605 --> 01:28:51.473
And I'm out for good.

01:28:51.475 --> 01:28:53.608
You understand?

01:28:53.610 --> 01:28:57.478
You got it, pal.

01:28:57.480 --> 01:28:59.416
8:00 AM.

01:29:04.620 --> 01:29:06.587
Syd Delicious.

01:29:06.589 --> 01:29:08.456
You look like shit.

01:29:08.458 --> 01:29:10.925
- Wow, nice.
- Where's Joe?

01:29:10.927 --> 01:29:12.560
I don't know, Syd, he's your boyfriend.

01:29:12.562 --> 01:29:13.761
Well, were you with him tonight?

01:29:13.763 --> 01:29:15.596
Seriously? Deal with it yourself.

01:29:15.598 --> 01:29:17.165
What have you guys been doing?

01:29:17.167 --> 01:29:18.666
It's been a really long night, Sydney.

01:29:18.668 --> 01:29:21.872
So either shut the fuck
up or get outta here!

01:29:27.010 --> 01:29:29.109
What, you're moving out?

01:29:29.111 --> 01:29:30.679
Yes.

01:29:30.681 --> 01:29:33.615
Now? In the middle of the night?

01:29:33.617 --> 01:29:36.521
Where's Ron Levin?

01:29:38.955 --> 01:29:41.926
You guys did something to him, didn't you?

01:29:43.927 --> 01:29:45.193
Well, I know that you did.

01:29:45.195 --> 01:29:47.062
And I can promise you
everybody else will too.

01:29:47.064 --> 01:29:49.063
No, I didn't do anything to Ron Levin.

01:29:49.065 --> 01:29:51.500
Did you see Joe today? Hey!

01:29:51.502 --> 01:29:53.902
You know, you wish you could be like Joe.

01:29:53.904 --> 01:29:55.804
But you're nothing like him.

01:29:55.806 --> 01:29:57.973
You are really pushing it, Sydney. Okay?

01:29:57.975 --> 01:29:59.907
You ruined Joe.

01:29:59.909 --> 01:30:01.910
All he ever wanted was to belong.

01:30:01.912 --> 01:30:04.612
And you made him think
he needed a BMW for that.

01:30:04.614 --> 01:30:08.517
Joe, could have been anything in the world!

01:30:08.519 --> 01:30:11.819
And now he is twisted and
he is lost because you...

01:30:11.821 --> 01:30:13.522
fucking ruined him!

01:30:13.524 --> 01:30:15.290
No, Joe was locker fodder until he met me!

01:30:15.292 --> 01:30:20.629
A geek you never would have
spread your fucking legs for.

01:30:20.631 --> 01:30:24.032
Where's Ron Levin? Huh?
What did you do to him?

01:30:24.034 --> 01:30:25.867
What did you do!

01:30:25.869 --> 01:30:29.507
Do you really wanna know?
Do you really wanna know?

01:30:31.975 --> 01:30:33.678
Fuck you!

01:31:04.941 --> 01:31:06.776
Joe?

01:31:10.247 --> 01:31:12.583
Joe, you okay?

01:31:14.584 --> 01:31:16.520
It all got away from me.

01:31:20.056 --> 01:31:21.992
All these little choices.

01:31:27.597 --> 01:31:29.533
Not even my choices.

01:31:36.006 --> 01:31:37.941
I need you to notarize a signature for me.

01:31:44.914 --> 01:31:49.319
Who are Hedayat and Ishmael Samedi?

01:31:53.022 --> 01:31:55.156
You don't want to know.

01:31:55.158 --> 01:31:57.692
I don't want to lie to you, okay?

01:31:57.694 --> 01:32:00.161
Joe...

01:32:00.163 --> 01:32:02.764
...you want me to commit fraud for you?

01:32:02.766 --> 01:32:04.702
Maybe lose my license?

01:32:06.035 --> 01:32:07.971
I'm asking you to save me.

01:32:10.906 --> 01:32:14.742
Look, my father appointed
me conservator of his estate.

01:32:14.744 --> 01:32:15.743
He's in Tehran.

01:32:15.745 --> 01:32:18.112
Apparently so.

01:32:18.114 --> 01:32:21.182
There a few more documents to sign...

01:32:21.184 --> 01:32:23.854
before we grant you access
to the safe deposit box.

01:32:28.324 --> 01:32:29.827
Right this way.

01:32:41.270 --> 01:32:42.806
Are you alright?

01:32:47.177 --> 01:32:49.747
Do you know how many people I've lied to?

01:32:53.283 --> 01:32:55.218
Dad, do you know how many people I've hurt?

01:32:57.020 --> 01:33:00.421
I've taken things from people...

01:33:00.423 --> 01:33:05.997
I will never be able to give back to them.

01:33:11.368 --> 01:33:13.137
Never.

01:33:15.439 --> 01:33:17.074
I don't know how I got here.

01:33:22.445 --> 01:33:24.247
We'll get through this.

01:33:31.387 --> 01:33:34.755
Joe Hunt, you are under arrest
for the charge of murder.

01:33:34.757 --> 01:33:36.424
Don't say anything, Joe.

01:33:36.426 --> 01:33:38.126
I'm getting you a lawyer.

01:33:38.128 --> 01:33:39.993
<i>With Sydney asking
so many questions...</i>

01:33:39.995 --> 01:33:44.232
<i>about Ron Levin, the cops
were sure to connect the dots.</i>

01:33:44.234 --> 01:33:49.370
<i>From Ron, to Joe, to the Persian...</i>

01:33:49.372 --> 01:33:52.439
<i>to me.</i>

01:33:52.441 --> 01:33:54.878
I tried to talk him out of it.

01:33:58.315 --> 01:34:02.183
But Joe and Tim went
into Ron Levin's house.

01:34:02.185 --> 01:34:04.055
They forced him to sign the check.

01:34:06.522 --> 01:34:08.857
And they killed him.

01:34:08.859 --> 01:34:11.059
<i>For a guy who saw all the angles...</i>

01:34:11.061 --> 01:34:14.261
<i>Joe should have seen this
one coming a mile away.</i>

01:34:14.263 --> 01:34:16.063
That's when Joe pitched his plan to me...

01:34:16.065 --> 01:34:20.335
Izzy, Tim and Charlie.

01:34:20.337 --> 01:34:24.906
The Persian sneak was
kidnapping, extortion...

01:34:24.908 --> 01:34:29.847
and murder from the very beginning.

01:34:31.314 --> 01:34:33.383
I didn't kill anyone.

01:34:37.087 --> 01:34:39.089
I tried to save the guy.

01:34:41.158 --> 01:34:42.191
I pulled out a screwdriver...

01:34:42.193 --> 01:34:44.925
and drove holes through
the lid of the trunk.

01:34:44.927 --> 01:34:47.297
So... so that he could get oxygen.

01:34:49.833 --> 01:34:52.803
But when I opened the lid of
the trunk and looked inside...

01:34:59.441 --> 01:35:05.915
Persian was staring back at me
with his eyes all bugged out.

01:35:07.217 --> 01:35:12.423
And he was... he was dead.

01:35:17.026 --> 01:35:19.062
It was Joe.

01:35:20.529 --> 01:35:23.363
It was all Joe.

01:35:23.365 --> 01:35:25.770
<i>Izzy's father never made it to L.A.</i>

01:35:28.605 --> 01:35:31.976
Yeah, we both thought so, too, but...

01:35:36.178 --> 01:35:38.315
Kill dog?

01:35:42.519 --> 01:35:44.419
You're free to go, Mr. Karney.

01:35:44.421 --> 01:35:46.353
But the State Attorney General's
office will want to hear...

01:35:46.355 --> 01:35:48.188
that story again in the morning.

01:35:48.190 --> 01:35:49.858
From the beginning.

01:35:49.860 --> 01:35:52.363
Okay. Thanks.

01:36:00.904 --> 01:36:03.036
<i>Our philosophy of self interest...</i>

01:36:03.038 --> 01:36:09.479
<i>brought us everything... and
then it took everything back.</i>

01:36:13.315 --> 01:36:17.484
<i>In America money equals respect.</i>

01:36:17.486 --> 01:36:19.586
<i>It didn't matter how
you got that money.</i>

01:36:19.588 --> 01:36:22.325
<i>You just had to have it.</i>

01:36:25.662 --> 01:36:29.630
<i>We thought we'd own the world.</i>

01:36:29.632 --> 01:36:32.836
<i>Turns out the only thing we
really had was each other.</i>

01:36:34.904 --> 01:36:37.473
<i>But now that is gone forever.</i>

01:37:04.968 --> 01:37:09.968
