00:02.001 --> 00:06.246
<i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

00:06.340 --> 00:09.208
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

00:09.301 --> 00:12.169
<i>but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

00:12.262 --> 00:14.754
<i>I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.</i>

00:15.349 --> 00:17.090
<i>But I became lost in time.</i>

00:17.267 --> 00:19.930
<i>It took everything in my friends'
power to bring me back.</i>

00:20.145 --> 00:23.058
<i>And in doing so, our world
was opened up to new threats.</i>

00:23.315 --> 00:25.932
<i>And I'm the only one fast enough
to stop them.</i>

00:26.151 --> 00:28.143
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

00:29.571 --> 00:31.062
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

00:31.156 --> 00:32.738
<i>The court
orders that Mr. Allen</i>

00:32.824 --> 00:35.737
<i>should be remanded
to Iron Heights Penitentiary.</i>

00:36.078 --> 00:37.910
- Get comfortable.
<i>- I didn't kill anybody.</i>

00:37.996 --> 00:41.330
Yeah, sure. Everyone's innocent here.
Especially that guy. Big Sir.

00:41.416 --> 00:43.373
Twelve markers, twelve metas.

00:43.460 --> 00:45.543
Now that we know how many there are,
we can go right to them.

00:45.629 --> 00:47.461
- I don't want any trouble.
- Too late.

00:51.218 --> 00:53.426
Thanks. I was just wondering
why you helped me.

00:53.512 --> 00:54.969
<i>Because your dad helped me.</i>

00:55.597 --> 00:57.008
He operated and saved my life.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.226
Cecile, are you sure
we even need a crib?

01:03.230 --> 01:06.519
I used to plop Iris on some cushions
and call it a night.

01:06.608 --> 01:08.725
Well, I'm glad to hear
you got all your parenting mistakes

01:08.819 --> 01:09.900
out of the way with your first kid.

01:09.987 --> 01:12.070
I think she turned out pretty good.

01:12.155 --> 01:16.069
Oh, babe. I cannot believe
I'm so big already.

01:16.159 --> 01:18.572
You know, I was barely
showing at this point with Joanie.

01:18.662 --> 01:20.654
All right, best I got.
What do you think?

01:21.498 --> 01:22.659
Mmm-hmm.

01:23.709 --> 01:25.416
- Are they?
- Are they what?

01:25.502 --> 01:27.243
- Too tight?
- Um...

01:27.337 --> 01:29.579
Hey, you just said that
you thought my clothes are too tight.

01:29.673 --> 01:30.754
Do I look bad?

01:30.841 --> 01:31.957
What? I didn't say that.

01:33.760 --> 01:36.002
What do you mean,
"When is it gonna go back to normal?"

01:37.556 --> 01:39.798
I didn't say that either.

01:43.353 --> 01:44.343
Look at me.

01:45.439 --> 01:47.476
- My lips aren't moving.
- What are you talking about?

01:47.566 --> 01:48.807
I heard you. I...

01:53.780 --> 01:57.649
- I can still hear you.
- What the hell is going on?

01:58.201 --> 01:59.783
Why can I hear what you're thinking?

02:00.912 --> 02:02.198
Oh, my God. Joe.

02:03.290 --> 02:05.077
I think I can read minds.

02:11.840 --> 02:13.456
Heart rate's 170 bpm,

02:13.550 --> 02:15.792
and there's no sign of
dark matter in the amniotic fluid.

02:16.428 --> 02:17.589
So the baby's not a meta?

02:17.679 --> 02:19.420
Nope, it's a perfectly normal baby...

02:21.558 --> 02:24.175
"Girl." You were gonna say
"baby girl."

02:24.978 --> 02:27.311
- I'm having another daughter?
- I'm gonna have a sister.

02:28.065 --> 02:30.307
Well, I guess we can
cancel the announcement party.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.318
Boy, girl, that's 50/50.

02:35.280 --> 02:36.896
Let's test your skills for real.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.402
What number am I thinking of?

02:40.869 --> 02:43.657
Three. Eleven. Twenty-five.

02:44.289 --> 02:45.825
Three again. Bulbasaur.

02:46.750 --> 02:47.957
What the hell is a Bulbasaur?

02:48.418 --> 02:49.408
So weird.

02:49.503 --> 02:51.415
Why would I be thinking about
PokÃ©mon at a time like this?

02:51.505 --> 02:54.043
- Yep. Definitely a telepath.
- But how?

02:54.675 --> 02:57.918
If the baby is not a meta, then
where did these powers come from?

02:58.053 --> 02:59.510
Nope, I wasn't on the bus.

02:59.888 --> 03:01.550
No, I was not abducted by aliens.

03:01.932 --> 03:05.391
No, I didn't inherit
a mystic totem from my grandma.

03:05.477 --> 03:07.764
Really, guys? Why are you
still thinking about Bulbasaur?

03:07.854 --> 03:09.766
- 'Cause he's the cutest one of all.
- Okay.

03:09.856 --> 03:11.347
My best hypothesis is

03:11.441 --> 03:13.603
this is actually triggered by
your latest phase of pregnancy

03:13.694 --> 03:17.278
and it's actually latent dark matter
that's been in your brain since

03:17.364 --> 03:19.401
maybe the first
particle accelerator explosion.

03:19.491 --> 03:21.153
Think of it like
gestational diabetes.

03:21.243 --> 03:23.109
But it's not.
You can fix that with insulin.

03:23.203 --> 03:24.569
Right, but it's temporary.

03:24.705 --> 03:27.448
I mean, the symptoms
should recede after childbirth.

03:29.459 --> 03:30.449
Hmm.

03:30.544 --> 03:33.002
Okay, we'll give you guys a minute.

03:35.424 --> 03:38.041
Joe, you're literally thinking,
"I'm worried about Cecile."

03:40.095 --> 03:41.882
I just want you
and the baby to be okay.

03:42.180 --> 03:43.216
I know.

03:43.515 --> 03:46.007
But, hey, maybe this will
turn out to be a good thing.

03:46.935 --> 03:49.143
I've always wondered
what goes on in that head of yours.

03:50.272 --> 03:52.309
<i>Cecile's a telepath.</i>

03:52.399 --> 03:55.107
Well, that's way more important
than getting Allen out of prison.

03:55.610 --> 03:57.067
- Not!
- Sick burn, Har.

03:57.154 --> 03:58.144
Please don't encourage him.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.854
Yeah, as a former prisoner,

03:59.948 --> 04:02.486
- I can tell you...
- No, that was gorilla prison.

04:02.576 --> 04:03.817
Gorilla prison is worse.

04:03.910 --> 04:05.117
They throw their scat at you.

04:05.203 --> 04:08.492
I can tell you that Allen is sitting
in his cell suffering while...

04:09.124 --> 04:11.912
this guy, DeVoe,
continues his plan unabated.

04:12.002 --> 04:14.039
Harry, Cecile
filed an appeal last week.

04:14.129 --> 04:16.041
We have no new evidence,
so that doesn't matter.

04:16.130 --> 04:17.166
We have satellites on the DeVoes.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.249
And they haven't made a move
in weeks, so that doesn't matter.

04:19.341 --> 04:20.708
Well, Barry is in gen pop,

04:20.802 --> 04:23.294
so worst case, he can always
phase out or I can breach him out.

04:23.388 --> 04:24.378
Then he'd be a fugitive.

04:24.473 --> 04:26.965
And by the way, Ramon, why do we not
have eyes on him in there?

04:27.058 --> 04:29.801
Hey, it's a pain trying to get
into an analog camera from here,

04:29.895 --> 04:33.104
- no matter how hard I hack.
- Hack harder.

04:34.191 --> 04:35.432
We're nowhere.

04:35.734 --> 04:37.976
This team is nowhere
and this is the team

04:38.069 --> 04:40.186
that got Barry out of
a pan-temporal speed prison

04:40.280 --> 04:42.317
and we can't
spring him from a county jail?

04:42.407 --> 04:44.865
Harry, we are working
just as hard as you. Okay?

04:45.243 --> 04:48.236
And, yes, it kills me to admit it,
but we are at a roadblock.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.158
So Barry is just gonna have to...

04:52.375 --> 04:53.365
Hold on.

04:56.004 --> 04:58.166
I mean, I can't even imagine
what he's going through.

05:00.759 --> 05:01.966
Read 'em and weep, boys.

05:02.052 --> 05:03.418
That's it.

05:03.845 --> 05:05.381
I'm dealing next round.

05:07.974 --> 05:10.136
You know, there's
something fishy about you, Allen.

05:10.227 --> 05:12.344
I'm fishy?
You tried to murder me and Joe.

05:12.437 --> 05:14.895
Well, if you can't play cards with
somebody who tried to murder you,

05:14.981 --> 05:16.438
you'll never play cards in here.

05:16.525 --> 05:18.266
Knew I'd regret
inviting you to this game.

05:18.568 --> 05:20.275
You may be big,
but you got no poker face.

06:03.864 --> 06:06.231
- Deuces again.
- Okay, I'm out.

06:07.242 --> 06:09.950
- Hey, you can't take that.
- It's my last pudding.

06:10.036 --> 06:12.153
Then you shouldn't have
thrown it in the pot, dumbass.

06:14.457 --> 06:15.664
Dumbass?

06:15.750 --> 06:18.333
A politician who gets caught
with his pants down.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.999
Yeah, I'd say you're a dumbass.

06:21.464 --> 06:23.547
Well, maybe
I'll just take the whole pot then.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.590
- Guys, come on.
- Don't screw with me, Bellows.

06:27.512 --> 06:29.799
Or what? You gonna shoot me?

06:30.724 --> 06:33.387
That's right.
You only shoot unarmed men.

06:52.621 --> 06:53.953
What the hell are you looking at?

06:55.332 --> 06:56.698
Is that really why you're in here?

06:57.250 --> 06:58.331
You shot an unarmed man?

06:58.793 --> 07:01.957
Yeah, I'm just another bad guy.
Now get the hell out.

07:03.340 --> 07:05.832
If my dad really risked his life
to save yours, then...

07:07.302 --> 07:08.838
I doubt you're just another bad guy.

07:10.722 --> 07:13.635
Hey, why don't you just tell me
what really happened?

07:32.994 --> 07:35.953
<i>"A suspect was arrested last night
after a botched robbery.</i>

07:36.247 --> 07:39.115
<i>"While attempting to steal
from a Mercury Labs shipping crate,</i>

07:39.209 --> 07:41.747
<i>"David P. Ratchet, alias Big Sir,</i>

07:41.836 --> 07:44.169
<i>"allegedly shot
and killed a security guard.</i>

07:44.923 --> 07:46.459
<i>"An eyewitness
called in the shooting."</i>

07:50.804 --> 07:53.387
"Ratchet was
previously arrested for fighting."

07:54.224 --> 07:57.058
The only forensic evidence
were bullet casings from the scene

07:57.143 --> 07:58.975
that matched the cartridge of a gun
you owned.

07:59.062 --> 08:00.803
Okay, time to go.

08:00.897 --> 08:03.810
Hey, firearm identification like that
can have errors.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.436
It's practically junk science.

08:05.527 --> 08:07.519
I said, time to go.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.355
You didn't kill that guy, did you?

08:15.578 --> 08:16.819
There was another guy.

08:18.373 --> 08:20.410
<i>He was my size, my frame.</i>

08:20.792 --> 08:23.705
<i>I heard the shots,
I tried to save the guard.</i>

08:25.547 --> 08:27.789
<i>Wrong place, wrong time.</i>

08:29.718 --> 08:32.677
- Why didn't you just tell me that?
- 'Cause it doesn't matter, Allen.

08:32.761 --> 08:34.173
It didn't matter to the cops.

08:34.264 --> 08:36.347
Not to my lawyer or the jury.

08:36.433 --> 08:39.676
They took one look at me
and decided I was the guy.

08:40.729 --> 08:42.220
That guy could still be out there.

08:42.313 --> 08:44.430
If I was that guy,

08:44.899 --> 08:47.642
I would have ditched this crap town
a long time ago.

08:51.823 --> 08:54.236
Central City loves her heroes.

08:54.325 --> 08:56.362
And I should know,
I'm your new mayor.

08:56.453 --> 08:58.115
But we all agree,
doing business in a city

08:58.204 --> 09:00.821
with meta-humans
can be a little risky.

09:01.082 --> 09:04.575
Technology companies in Central City
are robbed at nearly 30 times

09:04.669 --> 09:05.910
the national average.

09:06.004 --> 09:07.916
That's second
only to Star City, folks.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.499
Which is why I'm proud to unveil

09:11.593 --> 09:15.837
Kord Industries' newest
advanced research facility.

09:16.431 --> 09:18.969
Designed to be the most
secure building of its kind.

09:19.642 --> 09:22.350
Complete with
super-speed motion detectors,

09:22.437 --> 09:26.272
sonic vibration defenses
and laser beams that don't freeze.

09:26.524 --> 09:30.143
Believe me, no one is breaking into
this building anytime soon.

09:40.413 --> 09:41.654
I hate this city.

10:06.773 --> 10:08.810
Cecile. Hey, babe,
what are you doing here?

10:09.192 --> 10:10.558
I needed a helper

10:11.277 --> 10:13.018
- and, well, she wanted to help.
- Yeah.

10:13.613 --> 10:16.276
Cisco said you were working a case
about an R&D lab that vanished.

10:16.366 --> 10:18.699
I figured maybe I could help
dig up some clues,

10:18.785 --> 10:19.946
now that I'm a meta.

10:20.161 --> 10:21.493
Babe, you're not a meta.

10:21.996 --> 10:25.455
I can hear every one of these people.

10:25.667 --> 10:27.829
Dark matter
definitely left its mark here.

10:27.919 --> 10:28.955
I figured as much.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.245
That patrolman, right there.

10:32.173 --> 10:34.039
He is cheating on his wife.

10:34.384 --> 10:36.751
Ah...
Never trust a mustache, I always say.

10:36.845 --> 10:37.881
I have a mustache.

10:37.971 --> 10:40.088
No, you have a sexy goatee.

10:40.181 --> 10:41.422
He has a creeper mustache.

10:41.641 --> 10:42.677
Red tie.

10:42.767 --> 10:47.182
Oh, baby, red tie does not like his boss
very much.

10:47.272 --> 10:49.229
She's been doing this
all the way over here.

10:49.315 --> 10:51.807
- Mmm.
- And that lady right there. Joe...

10:52.193 --> 10:53.434
Joe, she is a thief.

10:54.279 --> 10:55.360
Thief!

10:55.822 --> 10:56.858
Staplers.

10:56.948 --> 10:58.484
She's been stealing them
out of her office for months now.

10:58.575 --> 11:00.032
She damn near
cleaned out the supply closet.

11:00.118 --> 11:01.325
Baby, I love you

11:01.411 --> 11:04.575
and I think it's great that
you have these new powers, but I...

11:04.664 --> 11:06.621
Oh. You want me to go.

11:06.958 --> 11:08.199
I don't want you to go.

11:08.293 --> 11:09.909
No, no, no. It's just 'cause
you wanna do your job.

11:10.003 --> 11:11.710
I totally get it. Go. Stop crime.

11:14.841 --> 11:16.252
- Love you.
- Love you.

11:17.051 --> 11:19.668
I can hear everyone. It's so fun.

11:22.974 --> 11:23.964
Hey.

11:24.058 --> 11:27.597
The closest security cam I can find
is from an ATM across the street.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.223
The footage is choppy, but...

11:31.232 --> 11:32.439
Look at that.

11:32.525 --> 11:35.563
- Did he just...
- Pull a Chevelle out of nowhere.

11:35.653 --> 11:37.895
I'm gonna run those plates.
See if I can get an ID on the dude.

11:37.989 --> 11:39.855
Copy that.

11:39.949 --> 11:41.281
Yes, I'll accept the charges.

11:42.202 --> 11:43.283
Hey, Barry.

11:44.621 --> 11:47.489
So Barry asked you to ask us
to get this guy out of prison?

11:47.582 --> 11:50.700
Barry has gotten close to this guy
who says he's innocent.

11:50.793 --> 11:52.409
It was a case of mistaken identity.

11:53.004 --> 11:55.542
Well, from what I could
find out on CCPN's archives,

11:55.632 --> 11:57.999
Big Sir's case
does sound a bit suspect.

11:58.343 --> 12:01.302
Fifteen years ago, he was
found guilty of shooting a guard,

12:01.387 --> 12:03.549
but there was no apparent motive.

12:03.640 --> 12:04.847
- Only one eyewitness?
- Mmm.

12:05.433 --> 12:06.765
Studies have shown that

12:06.851 --> 12:08.808
line-up composition,
verbal and non-verbal cues

12:08.895 --> 12:11.262
can all lead to
unintended false identifications.

12:11.731 --> 12:16.021
Look, this is all just fantastic,
but we're not really gonna do this.

12:16.110 --> 12:18.193
Yeah, I mean,
we've already got a lot on our plate

12:18.279 --> 12:19.770
just trying to free one innocent man.

12:19.864 --> 12:21.025
We all want Barry to be free,

12:21.115 --> 12:23.858
but I don't know that there's
much else we can do right now.

12:23.993 --> 12:25.074
We kinda hit a wall.

12:25.161 --> 12:26.948
We're not gonna get through that wall
while we are working on this.

12:27.038 --> 12:28.324
It's just one case.

12:28.414 --> 12:30.406
Yeah, and it's a case
that we have to take.

12:31.209 --> 12:33.952
Allen has made one request of us
since he's been incarcerated.

12:34.045 --> 12:35.877
A request
that doesn't even involve himself.

12:36.422 --> 12:37.629
We have to take this case.

12:37.715 --> 12:40.708
It's unsettling
how convincing you can be sometimes.

12:40.802 --> 12:42.634
I got a plate match on the Chevelle.

12:42.720 --> 12:44.302
It's registered to a perp who has

12:44.389 --> 12:46.631
multiple
breaking and entering priors.

12:47.308 --> 12:49.391
"Sylbert Rundine."

12:50.144 --> 12:52.352
Why does every villain in this city

12:52.438 --> 12:54.179
have a name that sounds like
it came out of a comic book?

12:54.274 --> 12:55.685
He must go by something for short.

12:56.025 --> 12:57.357
Syl. Sylbie.

12:58.319 --> 13:00.311
- Bertie.
- What do we wanna do about this case?

13:00.488 --> 13:03.447
Well, my dad, Cisco and Ralph
are gonna question Rundine

13:03.533 --> 13:05.195
and I'm gonna call Cecile and see

13:05.285 --> 13:07.072
if she can pull up
the case file on Big Sir.

13:07.704 --> 13:09.070
You won't even have to say it.

13:09.747 --> 13:11.329
"Bertie"? Are you for real with that?

13:11.416 --> 13:13.373
Yeah.
I bet you five bucks it's Bertie.

13:13.835 --> 13:14.825
You're on.

13:19.549 --> 13:20.585
Hey.

13:20.883 --> 13:22.465
Allen, you're stirring up my dust.

13:22.552 --> 13:23.838
Oh, sorry.

13:24.012 --> 13:25.469
Um, I've got some news.

13:25.930 --> 13:29.799
So I have some friends that I thought
could help with your case

13:30.810 --> 13:33.348
- and they've agreed to do it.
- CCPD cop friends?

13:34.272 --> 13:35.683
Not exactly.

13:35.773 --> 13:38.766
But, um, if there's anybody
that can prove you innocent,

13:38.860 --> 13:39.896
it's these guys.

13:39.986 --> 13:41.727
'Cause they did
a bang-up job of clearing you.

13:42.488 --> 13:43.729
That's not really...

13:43.823 --> 13:45.234
- I mean, my case...
- Look,

13:46.034 --> 13:47.946
just call them and tell them to stop.

13:48.036 --> 13:50.699
I don't understand
why you're not excited about this.

13:52.582 --> 13:55.290
What you're peddling, it's dangerous.

13:55.376 --> 13:57.959
- What's dangerous?
- Hope.

13:59.464 --> 14:02.332
I've been in here long enough
to understand that in prison,

14:02.425 --> 14:05.463
hope is the most dangerous thing.

14:06.471 --> 14:08.212
Wait. Did you get that
from <i>Shawshank?</i>

14:09.766 --> 14:11.632
No, I got that from being in prison.

14:12.352 --> 14:15.561
Tell your friends
to stop wasting their time.

14:25.490 --> 14:26.947
Sylbert Rundine?

14:27.617 --> 14:28.949
It's the CCPD.

14:32.997 --> 14:34.954
- You Sylbert Rundine?
- Bert.

14:35.583 --> 14:37.575
"Rundine." The "E" is silent.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.164
So close.

14:40.922 --> 14:42.504
I'm Detective Joe West.
These are my associates.

14:42.590 --> 14:44.377
We're looking into a robbery
that took place.

14:44.467 --> 14:45.799
Wanted to ask you some questions.

14:46.052 --> 14:47.088
Okay.

14:47.220 --> 14:50.338
- Do you own a 1970 Chevelle?
- Well, I used to.

14:50.431 --> 14:51.638
Oh, my glob.

14:52.141 --> 14:55.885
Is that a replica of DARPA's HTV-3X?

14:55.978 --> 14:57.344
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:57.647 --> 14:59.684
Don't you know not to
mess with another man's toys?

14:59.774 --> 15:01.015
You mean "figurines."

15:02.068 --> 15:03.104
Yes.

15:03.945 --> 15:05.061
Yes, he does.

15:05.696 --> 15:06.686
Wow.

15:07.073 --> 15:08.905
This is a perfect replica.

15:09.367 --> 15:12.075
It even has a tiny automatic
navigation control system.

15:12.286 --> 15:15.324
This is the reason
I don't have any money in my savings.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.997
- Oh, I get it.
- Is this you?

15:18.376 --> 15:20.208
Yeah, hard to believe.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.995
Fifteen years ago,
I was a bit of a gym rat.

15:23.172 --> 15:24.208
Hey, Joe.

15:24.841 --> 15:26.332
It's a pretty nice figurine.

15:27.301 --> 15:30.510
Well, gentlemen,
I was just about to head out.

15:30.596 --> 15:32.713
So, if you guys are good here...

15:33.599 --> 15:36.933
Fifteen years ago, did you spend
any time around Mercury Labs?

15:57.123 --> 15:58.955
Cisco, get us to the alley.

16:02.253 --> 16:03.243
Damn.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.044
He wasn't that quick, was he?

16:05.256 --> 16:06.963
You guys check down there.
I'll check the streets.

16:07.049 --> 16:08.039
Okay.

16:10.636 --> 16:11.843
Guys, he's here!

16:13.556 --> 16:14.717
Hey, hold it right there.

16:17.602 --> 16:19.059
Oh, that feels weird.

16:21.230 --> 16:22.687
Joe, he's getting away!

16:23.691 --> 16:25.102
I think we got bigger problems.

16:36.871 --> 16:39.113
- This is...
- Ridiculous.

16:39.665 --> 16:40.826
You okay, guys?

16:41.918 --> 16:44.126
Are we doing okay? Are we doing okay?

16:44.212 --> 16:46.920
Does it look like we're doing okay?
We're two inches tall, Caitlin!

16:47.256 --> 16:50.715
Yeah, I'm like Cisco-size now.
Is this always how you see the world?

16:50.801 --> 16:51.917
Oh, that's really funny, man.

16:52.011 --> 16:53.627
I guess your body
just finally shrunk down

16:53.721 --> 16:56.054
to a size that's proportional
to your brain!

16:56.849 --> 17:00.013
Ralph, have you tried just
stretching back to normal size?

17:00.937 --> 17:01.927
Uh...

17:04.147 --> 17:06.765
Oh, my back! Geez Louise.

17:06.858 --> 17:09.021
Okay, you know what?
Maybe I can breach us out of here.

17:18.788 --> 17:21.576
Really thought
I was gonna go further than that.

17:22.415 --> 17:23.781
How many fingers am I holding up?

17:24.335 --> 17:25.371
What fingers?

17:25.545 --> 17:27.537
You're no less annoying at that size.

17:27.630 --> 17:30.623
Hey, guys. I think I got something.

17:30.716 --> 17:33.083
So, I wasn't able to pin
Ray Palmer or the <i>Waverider,</i>

17:33.177 --> 17:35.089
but I was able to reach Felicity.

17:35.263 --> 17:37.926
So, Ray uses dwarf star alloy

17:38.015 --> 17:41.099
to power the shrinking capabilities
in the A.T.O.M. suit.

17:41.185 --> 17:42.346
But on October 10th,

17:42.436 --> 17:44.519
Palmer Tech's
last depository of alloy

17:44.605 --> 17:46.141
was stolen from
Central City's facility.

17:46.232 --> 17:48.645
October 10th, that's the day
Barry came out of the Speed Force.

17:48.734 --> 17:50.771
So he hits the facility,
then he hops on the bus.

17:50.861 --> 17:53.399
So, a dwarf star alloy
plus dark matter

17:53.489 --> 17:56.152
equals Rundine's shrinking powers?

17:56.242 --> 17:58.780
Not exactly.
Nature doesn't work to scale.

17:58.869 --> 18:01.031
If the human body were to shrink,
we can't lift our skeleton.

18:01.122 --> 18:03.159
So Rundine's power
must be able to shrink

18:03.249 --> 18:04.785
the space between atomic bonds.

18:04.875 --> 18:06.958
Miniaturize tech, so you can steal it

18:07.044 --> 18:09.161
and then make it big
so you can sell it.

18:09.797 --> 18:10.878
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:10.965 --> 18:12.172
Ratchet's trial records.

18:12.258 --> 18:13.248
Oh.

18:13.467 --> 18:15.003
You really think the guy
who shrunk that building

18:15.094 --> 18:17.006
is the same guy
we need to free Barry's friend?

18:17.430 --> 18:19.467
Well... I mean, look.

18:20.391 --> 18:21.632
Be easy to mistake them, right?

18:21.726 --> 18:23.183
I mean, they certainly
had a resemblance.

18:23.269 --> 18:27.058
Rundine hit up the warehouse a month
after they picked up Big Sir.

18:27.148 --> 18:29.140
Still, that's a big coincidence.

18:29.233 --> 18:31.691
I keep saying it. There is no
coincidences when it comes to DeVoe

18:31.777 --> 18:33.018
and that includes Barry's cellmate.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.774
Well, I can't sell that to a judge.

18:35.156 --> 18:36.488
So, if we wanna get Big Sir out,

18:36.574 --> 18:39.487
we're gonna need
a confession from Dr. Shrinker.

18:39.577 --> 18:40.738
Dwarfstar!

18:40.828 --> 18:42.285
What the hell is that?

18:42.371 --> 18:44.408
Well, that's what I'm naming him.
See, "Dwarfstar."

18:44.498 --> 18:45.534
- Oh, God.
- Yeah.

18:45.875 --> 18:48.037
Oh, it takes a lot of time
to breach here.

18:49.295 --> 18:51.161
Who spit gum on the floor?

18:51.255 --> 18:53.463
I'm a gumshoe!

18:53.549 --> 18:55.040
Not gum on a shoe!

18:55.134 --> 18:56.625
Oh, my God. Get him off, get him off!

18:57.678 --> 19:00.512
Ugh.

19:01.390 --> 19:02.972
You guys are
going in the hamster cage.

19:03.059 --> 19:05.301
Ugh. Hamster cage?

19:05.394 --> 19:06.760
Don't drop me! Don't drop me!

19:11.609 --> 19:14.477
Harry, this is not your fault.

19:14.820 --> 19:15.981
Yeah, well, it kinda...

19:17.907 --> 19:21.025
Don't read my mind, okay?
What am I thinking now?

19:21.369 --> 19:22.610
- Oh, God.
- Great.

19:22.703 --> 19:24.490
Now, if you'll excuse me,

19:24.580 --> 19:28.039
I'm gonna go build a
reverse polarity dwarf star matrix.

19:28.125 --> 19:29.115
Great name, Ray Palmer.

19:29.210 --> 19:32.544
Was "electron-degenerate
sub-atomizer" taken?

19:33.756 --> 19:34.746
Electron...

19:38.135 --> 19:40.218
Oh, you have no idea
what Harry was talking about.

19:40.304 --> 19:43.263
Or what anyone
around here is ever talking about.

19:44.016 --> 19:46.633
- I gotta call Barry.
- Okay.

19:49.355 --> 19:53.770
I can hear you, Iris, and there is
nothing wrong with me and Joe.

19:53.984 --> 19:55.816
Right. Yes. Totally.

19:57.029 --> 19:59.487
It's just that if you ever,
you know, think

19:59.573 --> 20:00.689
there is something wrong,

20:00.783 --> 20:03.116
I know someone who could help.
That's all.

20:06.372 --> 20:07.908
I'm Dr. Sharon Finkel.

20:07.998 --> 20:09.955
Thank you for
seeing us on short notice.

20:10.167 --> 20:11.829
- Lucky us.
- Of course.

20:12.253 --> 20:14.961
The reason that we're here today is

20:15.047 --> 20:19.007
I've been experiencing some
unusual pregnancy symptoms.

20:19.093 --> 20:20.504
You know,
the first time I was pregnant,

20:20.594 --> 20:21.835
it was a really long time ago,

20:21.929 --> 20:23.716
and things were very different
at that point.

20:23.806 --> 20:27.550
Eggs, bread, olive oil.
I'm sorry, are you...

20:28.519 --> 20:29.726
Are you making a grocery list?

20:31.105 --> 20:33.768
Of course not. I would not...

20:34.817 --> 20:39.357
So, tell me more about
the symptoms you're experiencing.

20:39.739 --> 20:43.824
It's almost as if I have become

20:43.909 --> 20:47.277
aware of Joe's thoughts.

20:47.788 --> 20:49.950
- Like I read his diary.
- My diary?

20:50.040 --> 20:52.407
Your pregnancy
made you read Joe's diary?

20:52.501 --> 20:53.912
What do you mean,
you're taking his side?

20:54.128 --> 20:55.209
I don't take sides.

20:55.421 --> 20:57.253
You just think that I'm in the wrong.

20:57.506 --> 20:59.293
- I would never think...
- Maybe this was a bad idea.

20:59.550 --> 21:01.712
No, no. No, babe,
we're not done here.

21:01.886 --> 21:03.627
Therapy scares you
and you don't like this woman

21:03.804 --> 21:05.921
- hearing all your business.
- Cecile... That's not true.

21:06.015 --> 21:08.223
And now you just wanna go, you think
this whole thing is a waste of time.

21:08.392 --> 21:09.382
Cecile, stop.

21:09.602 --> 21:12.265
You're thinking about
a pink elephant over and over?

21:13.564 --> 21:15.180
You're trying to block me out.

21:15.357 --> 21:17.189
Can I just ask one question?

21:17.359 --> 21:19.772
Really, a pink elephant?

21:20.029 --> 21:22.112
Why are you hiding
your thoughts from me?

21:22.323 --> 21:23.905
Because you're making me do it.

21:25.910 --> 21:28.118
Cecile, when we got back together,
I promised you

21:28.245 --> 21:30.328
that I would never keep any secrets
from you again.

21:31.582 --> 21:34.791
Except now, it feels like I have to.

21:40.466 --> 21:42.332
Hey, they found him.

21:42.718 --> 21:44.630
His name is Sylbert Rundine,
he's been arrested

21:44.762 --> 21:46.344
for a whole bunch of crimes
like yours.

21:46.514 --> 21:48.722
And he used to look
just like you, too.

21:49.266 --> 21:50.382
You're getting out of here.

21:50.601 --> 21:52.467
Wow, you have a hard shoulder.

21:52.645 --> 21:54.637
So yesterday
I tell you what happened,

21:54.897 --> 21:56.684
and today you find the guy.

21:57.608 --> 21:59.349
- That happened in a...
- "Flash"?

21:59.610 --> 22:00.896
- Snap.
- Snap.

22:01.070 --> 22:02.481
You cops and your blinders.

22:02.738 --> 22:04.229
Probably got the wrong guy again.

22:04.949 --> 22:08.363
Well, technically they haven't
gotten him yet.

22:08.577 --> 22:11.115
You see? Something always goes wrong.

22:11.497 --> 22:13.329
Why do you have to make this so hard?

22:14.959 --> 22:16.666
It's okay to believe.

22:16.961 --> 22:17.951
Yeah?

22:18.504 --> 22:20.666
Why it is so easy for you to believe?

22:20.840 --> 22:24.709
You know my dad was in here
for a crime he didn't commit, right?

22:25.010 --> 22:26.171
Do you know what happened?

22:26.595 --> 22:28.382
After 17 years,

22:28.556 --> 22:30.764
the man that killed my mom confessed.

22:31.517 --> 22:33.179
My dad got to go home.

22:34.603 --> 22:36.265
Why shouldn't you get
to go home, too?

22:38.232 --> 22:39.814
Seventeen years, huh?

22:40.985 --> 22:42.897
You think they'll catch Rundine?

22:43.654 --> 22:45.691
You really think it's gonna happen?

22:46.490 --> 22:49.028
I promise. You're getting out.

22:52.955 --> 22:54.947
So, in hindsight, I can see

22:55.124 --> 22:58.413
how putting you guys in
a hamster cage could be humiliating.

22:59.086 --> 23:00.918
- You think?
- Sorry for that.

23:01.130 --> 23:02.792
For the record, this is awesome,

23:03.090 --> 23:05.798
but why do you guys
have a giant LEGO set anyway?

23:05.968 --> 23:08.255
It is a three-dimensional model
of the place

23:08.429 --> 23:10.011
where I was predestined
to be brutally murdered

23:10.097 --> 23:11.963
by a twisted future version of Barry.

23:12.850 --> 23:13.840
That guy.

23:14.101 --> 23:16.844
But what a difference a year makes.

23:17.438 --> 23:19.225
What did you do to my bazooka?

23:19.440 --> 23:22.854
Well, I turned your bazooka
into an embiggening bazooka,

23:22.943 --> 23:24.354
with the help of the dwarf star alloy

23:24.445 --> 23:25.981
we stole from Rundine's apartment

23:26.238 --> 23:28.776
and improving upon
Ray Palmer's amateurish schematics.

23:29.116 --> 23:30.402
Presto chango.

23:30.618 --> 23:31.825
Embiggening bazooka.

23:32.036 --> 23:34.153
Now, if you'll just hold on...

23:34.246 --> 23:36.112
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
We're gonna do this now?

23:36.415 --> 23:38.702
Well, yeah. Rundine's in the wind.

23:38.876 --> 23:40.367
These two are small,
we need to embiggen them,

23:40.461 --> 23:42.248
- and we need to free an innocent man.
- Okay, first of all,

23:42.504 --> 23:44.416
"embiggen" is not a word,
and second of all,

23:44.590 --> 23:46.081
shouldn't we test this first?

23:46.342 --> 23:47.708
Hey!

23:47.801 --> 23:49.667
I'll be a test subject. Come on.

23:50.095 --> 23:51.961
- Take me.
- Sure, why not.

23:52.056 --> 23:54.298
That's the spirit. Here we go.

23:54.391 --> 23:55.802
And...

23:57.144 --> 23:59.261
- West. You should probably...
- Mmm?

23:59.355 --> 24:00.891
Oh, God, yeah, sorry.

24:01.690 --> 24:04.103
And three, two, one.

24:10.407 --> 24:12.444
Nope. Still tiny.

24:18.540 --> 24:20.327
Hey, are we supposed to be
doing that?

24:22.670 --> 24:24.536
- Oh, no.
- Their cells are exploding.

24:24.755 --> 24:26.747
Whatever that embiggening gun did
to Ralph and Cisco

24:26.966 --> 24:29.003
seems to have destabilized them
on an atomic level.

24:29.301 --> 24:30.792
- How long do they have?
- At this rate,

24:31.011 --> 24:33.879
I would guess, complete
cellular explosion within 10 hours.

24:44.400 --> 24:47.609
You know, man, prison pudding is
so much better than outside pudding.

24:48.112 --> 24:49.398
Obviously.

24:50.406 --> 24:51.772
Any news from your friends?

24:53.075 --> 24:55.909
Um, no, not yet, but they're probably
just busy tracking Rundine.

24:56.120 --> 24:58.237
A seasoned criminal like that
knows how to not be found, you know.

24:58.580 --> 24:59.866
Yeah, I get it, man.

25:01.208 --> 25:02.324
Hey, um...

25:03.293 --> 25:05.080
Do you have any plans
for when you get out?

25:05.170 --> 25:07.162
No, I really haven't thought about it
very much.

25:07.798 --> 25:10.381
Oh, come on, you've gotta
have something that you've dreamed of.

25:10.467 --> 25:14.006
Like opening a business or climbing
to the top of Mount Everest.

25:14.096 --> 25:16.179
- Bungee-jumping.
- This ain't the movies, Allen.

25:16.390 --> 25:18.473
This is real life, man.

25:18.684 --> 25:21.643
Reality is, I ain't got nobody
or nothing

25:21.854 --> 25:23.265
waiting for me on the outside.

25:23.439 --> 25:24.805
Even if I do get out,

25:25.065 --> 25:26.647
I'll probably end up
at the docks anyway.

25:26.900 --> 25:29.017
Okay, look. I spent most of my life
in love with a girl

25:29.111 --> 25:31.694
who was way out of my league.
Now she's my wife.

25:32.406 --> 25:34.693
Sometimes things do end up
like in the movies.

25:37.327 --> 25:38.488
Jiaju.

25:39.121 --> 25:40.783
- Come again?
- Jiaju.

25:41.373 --> 25:43.956
Tiny village in China.
Beautiful place.

25:44.251 --> 25:46.994
Very secluded.
Monks all take a vow of silence.

25:48.130 --> 25:49.587
Inmate Allen.

25:50.007 --> 25:52.169
- A word?
- Yeah.

25:56.555 --> 25:58.091
I see you've made a new friend.

25:59.641 --> 26:01.507
Yeah, I guess I have.

26:01.852 --> 26:03.263
I find that interesting.

26:03.520 --> 26:04.681
Especially since I was just asked

26:04.855 --> 26:06.938
to turn over inmate Ratchet's
case file to the DA

26:07.107 --> 26:08.643
who represented you for your trial.

26:09.068 --> 26:10.354
Coincidence?

26:10.611 --> 26:13.149
Not everyone that's in here
deserves to be in here.

26:14.239 --> 26:16.777
Have you ever heard
the name Aaron Miller?

26:17.534 --> 26:18.524
No.

26:18.744 --> 26:21.987
Miller was a prisoner here who took
to studying at the law library.

26:22.539 --> 26:25.577
One day, Mr. Miller decided
to take on the appeal

26:25.793 --> 26:27.159
of a fellow inmate's case.

26:27.711 --> 26:31.170
When he was
invariably unsuccessful

26:31.548 --> 26:33.084
that fellow inmate

26:33.425 --> 26:35.166
stabbed Mr. Miller to death.

26:38.555 --> 26:40.296
Your friend may look like a man,

26:41.475 --> 26:43.592
but he is unquestionably a monster.

26:44.686 --> 26:46.393
Everyone here is a monster.

26:46.688 --> 26:48.771
And if you insist on continuing
to bait them,

26:49.024 --> 26:50.356
I guarantee you,

26:51.026 --> 26:52.858
you will get mauled.

26:56.406 --> 26:59.615
- All right, coming in hot.
- Oh, hey, you don't have to do all that.

26:59.993 --> 27:02.406
Listen, I did not inherit
my dad's skills in the kitchen,

27:02.579 --> 27:05.037
but a decaf herbal tea,
that I can do.

27:05.499 --> 27:08.287
So, if it's okay with you,
I just was wondering

27:08.502 --> 27:10.619
if I could talk to you about Joe.

27:11.296 --> 27:14.255
Um, yeah, of course it's okay.

27:14.341 --> 27:16.298
Oh, no, honey, it's not about that.

27:16.385 --> 27:19.628
We have zero problems
in that department, as you can tell.

27:20.722 --> 27:21.838
Okay.

27:22.808 --> 27:23.798
TMI. But okay.

27:23.892 --> 27:26.225
I really thought
being able to read his mind

27:26.311 --> 27:29.145
would make our relationship stronger,
not push us apart.

27:29.231 --> 27:32.975
Well, how does my dad feel
about your new powers?

27:33.068 --> 27:35.435
He thinks it's gonna take
a little getting used to.

27:35.654 --> 27:37.486
Yeah, but how does he feel?

27:37.990 --> 27:39.731
Look, we all know that my dad thinks

27:39.825 --> 27:42.613
that he's this cool, grounded
man of mystery.

27:42.703 --> 27:44.319
But we all know
that he's actually just...

27:44.413 --> 27:46.746
A big softy.

27:46.832 --> 27:49.290
But if you really want to get closer
to my dad,

27:49.376 --> 27:52.369
you need to stop focusing
on what he's thinking

27:52.838 --> 27:54.249
and find out what he's feeling.

27:57.092 --> 27:59.300
Maybe we could use
a biochemical treatment

27:59.386 --> 28:00.593
and target the pituitary glands,

28:00.679 --> 28:01.715
flood them
with human growth hormones?

28:01.805 --> 28:03.421
No, that would
just accelerate their...

28:04.391 --> 28:05.757
It'll make things worse.

28:05.893 --> 28:07.225
- Guys?
- What?

28:07.895 --> 28:09.477
- Guys?
- Yeah.

28:09.646 --> 28:11.433
- Guys?
- What?

28:13.692 --> 28:16.776
Little Ralphy needs to use
the little boy's room.

28:17.237 --> 28:18.523
Didn't you just go?

28:19.031 --> 28:21.990
My bladder is literally the size
of a hummingbird's right now.

28:22.534 --> 28:23.650
Come on, Caitlin.

28:23.785 --> 28:25.401
Help a wee fellow take a wee-wee.

28:25.495 --> 28:26.736
- Can you...
- Me?

28:26.914 --> 28:28.246
I'm not touching it.

28:29.124 --> 28:32.413
Fine. I'll take you there, but you
have to find your own way out.

28:33.795 --> 28:36.833
- Thank you.
- Could've just gone in the bushes.

28:36.924 --> 28:38.460
Gross.

28:43.388 --> 28:45.675
The embiggening bazooka
made us unstable, didn't it?

28:45.766 --> 28:47.849
Yeah. No! What? No!

28:48.518 --> 28:49.679
Why would you say that?

28:49.770 --> 28:51.511
I can see it all over your face.

28:51.897 --> 28:53.479
- What?
- Your face is huge.

28:53.690 --> 28:55.773
I'm watching your emotions on IMAX.

28:56.151 --> 28:57.562
Yeah. Yeah.

28:57.945 --> 28:59.527
This was supposed to be an easy W,
all right?

28:59.613 --> 29:02.230
An easy victory. All we had to do
was capture Rundine.

29:02.324 --> 29:03.610
Couldn't even do that for Allen.

29:03.825 --> 29:07.364
- Okay, so you tried.
- Yeah, I failed. Because I'm stupid.

29:07.579 --> 29:10.037
All right?
Too stupid to help Allen's friend,

29:10.123 --> 29:12.410
too stupid to fix you,
or too stupid to stop DeVoe.

29:12.501 --> 29:14.834
Ow! What was that for?

29:15.045 --> 29:17.628
Believe me,
I'd punch you in the arm if I could.

29:19.925 --> 29:22.167
Look, I know you're not used
to going up against

29:22.261 --> 29:24.048
someone you can't outsmart
like DeVoe,

29:24.137 --> 29:27.847
but you really are stupid
if you think you're too stupid.

29:28.350 --> 29:30.637
You wanna help Barry?
You wanna free him?

29:30.978 --> 29:33.220
Get out of your own way
and un-shrink us.

29:33.313 --> 29:35.555
You weren't shrunk, all right?
That's not how his powers work.

29:35.649 --> 29:36.810
His powers...

29:38.902 --> 29:42.486
work by not just
removing the space between the atoms,

29:42.572 --> 29:44.279
but also taking out
the gravity particles

29:44.366 --> 29:47.404
and the dark energy so that
when he embiggens an object...

29:47.869 --> 29:50.737
He's refilling it with
the same combination of energy

29:50.831 --> 29:52.163
- he extracted.
- Yes.

29:52.249 --> 29:54.992
- Harry, if you wanna fix us...
- We need to put you back

29:55.085 --> 29:56.826
in Rundine's line of fire.

30:00.132 --> 30:02.215
Central City's Weather
Services Agency

30:02.301 --> 30:04.543
is always on the cutting edge
of radar technology.

30:04.970 --> 30:07.678
Which is why I'm so excited
to show you the newest addition

30:07.764 --> 30:09.096
to our stationary airship fleet.

30:09.599 --> 30:11.511
Now, let's go take a closer look.

30:19.985 --> 30:21.942
What do you mean we only have
20 minutes until we explode?

30:22.029 --> 30:23.065
Actually, it's only 18 minutes

30:23.155 --> 30:25.317
before your equilibrium
totally destabilizes.

30:25.449 --> 30:27.862
You're gonna blow up
in under 20 minutes

30:27.951 --> 30:30.534
unless we re-expose you
to Rundine's energy blast, okay?

30:30.620 --> 30:32.361
Okay, so facial recognition
just picked him up

30:32.456 --> 30:34.448
at Weather Services Airfield.
I think he's trying to skip town.

30:34.583 --> 30:36.620
Okay, I'm gonna stay here
and try to figure out a cure.

30:38.253 --> 30:41.872
Hey, sir, you need to leave.
The museum is closing for the day.

30:42.090 --> 30:43.422
I know.

30:43.592 --> 30:46.255
I just thought this would look great
on my shelf.

30:48.513 --> 30:50.755
Red alert! Red alert!
Everyone, evacuate!

30:53.268 --> 30:55.510
- Gotta go faster, gotta go faster.
- Do you wanna drive this thing?

30:55.687 --> 30:59.431
Kinda do. Ramon! Remember, when
Rundine tries to shrink the van,

30:59.649 --> 31:02.266
you've got to get in the path
of his blast. You understand?

31:02.486 --> 31:04.603
Copy that!
We're heading into the hangar now.

31:08.075 --> 31:12.319
- Uh, guys, I think he sees us.
- You're not getting big again.

31:26.176 --> 31:27.337
I'll go left, you go right.

31:33.975 --> 31:36.843
Harry, try and flank him.
We're gonna come around the other side.

31:36.937 --> 31:38.178
Copy that.

31:39.398 --> 31:41.390
Evasive maneuvers!
Evasive maneuvers!

31:41.483 --> 31:42.473
I know. I'm doin' it.

31:42.651 --> 31:43.732
Oh, boy.

31:47.989 --> 31:50.106
We've got to figure out
how to get him to fire at us.

31:54.496 --> 31:55.737
Abort!

31:59.626 --> 32:00.616
We're falling too fast.

32:00.710 --> 32:01.700
Think light thoughts.

32:01.795 --> 32:03.002
I'm thinking
how you nearly got us killed.

32:03.088 --> 32:04.204
Think lighter.

32:06.091 --> 32:07.081
Snow!

32:07.175 --> 32:09.337
<i>- Tell me you got something.</i>
- The cure's not done yet.

32:09.511 --> 32:10.877
Only one minute
until the boys go nuclear.

32:11.012 --> 32:13.254
- I don't wanna explode.
- What do we do?

32:13.849 --> 32:15.181
We go to Plan B.

32:29.448 --> 32:32.316
I'm gonna shrink you down
to the subatomic level, boy.

32:32.409 --> 32:33.775
Oh, is that right?

32:36.621 --> 32:38.203
I'd like to see you try.

32:58.518 --> 33:01.181
I'm big again. I'm big again!

33:01.605 --> 33:05.770
Remind me to never again breach into
any of Harry's stank-ass pockets.

33:07.360 --> 33:09.852
Hey. Sorry again about stepping on you.

33:09.988 --> 33:11.524
Hey, you saved me a trip
to the chiropractor.

33:11.615 --> 33:12.776
I guess so.

33:13.575 --> 33:14.656
You did it.

33:16.536 --> 33:17.617
Yeah, I guess I did.

33:17.746 --> 33:19.783
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say

33:19.873 --> 33:21.956
can and will be used against you
in a court of law.

33:22.125 --> 33:23.241
You have the right to an attorney.

33:23.460 --> 33:24.496
If you cannot afford one,

33:24.586 --> 33:26.873
one will be provided for you.
Hands behind your back.

33:28.507 --> 33:29.588
Rundine.

33:31.009 --> 33:32.591
Fifteen years ago,

33:32.928 --> 33:34.920
did you rob a Mercury Labs warehouse?

33:35.263 --> 33:36.845
Give us a confession now,

33:37.057 --> 33:39.470
I guarantee the DA
will cut you a deal.

33:40.227 --> 33:41.684
Mercury Labs.

33:43.647 --> 33:45.559
That's the one
that Ratchet got fingered for.

33:49.444 --> 33:51.561
I laughed so hard
when that guy got arrested.

33:53.073 --> 33:54.439
You want a confession?

33:55.242 --> 33:56.358
Find a priest.

33:56.993 --> 33:58.484
I'd rather rot.

34:11.882 --> 34:13.293
Yeah, all right, thanks.

34:15.469 --> 34:17.462
Hey, Joe, just hold on a second,
all right?

34:21.268 --> 34:23.100
Ain't good news, is it?

34:26.063 --> 34:27.554
Rundine won't confess.

34:28.065 --> 34:29.398
My friends tried everything.

34:29.775 --> 34:32.313
I mean, the DA offered
every deal she could, but...

34:32.779 --> 34:34.110
I'm so sorry, man...

34:36.908 --> 34:39.275
Look, you were right about everything
in here.

34:39.369 --> 34:42.328
You know, I made you a promise and...

34:43.581 --> 34:44.993
I let you down.

34:46.251 --> 34:47.583
You damn idiot.

34:48.670 --> 34:50.753
You did not let me down.

34:53.341 --> 34:54.877
I forgot what hope felt like.

34:56.136 --> 34:57.593
It's not a bad thing.

35:01.725 --> 35:03.341
I'll see you around, kid.

35:12.736 --> 35:14.022
Hey. Sorry.

35:14.112 --> 35:15.353
It's okay, Barr.

35:15.614 --> 35:17.822
<i>I just wanted to say thanks
for trying, you know.</i>

35:17.907 --> 35:20.615
And I'm sorry
to send you on this goose chase.

35:20.702 --> 35:23.069
Barry, that place you're in
is full of walls.

35:23.204 --> 35:26.788
When you hit one of those walls,
you find a way to get through it.

35:27.417 --> 35:28.874
<i>Don't lose your faith.</i>

35:28.960 --> 35:31.122
<i>There's too many people
counting on you.</i>

35:31.212 --> 35:32.874
<i>Out here and in there.</i>

35:33.840 --> 35:35.001
Yeah.

36:31.940 --> 36:33.101
Nope.

36:34.150 --> 36:36.312
Nobody leaves
until we're both good again.

36:37.946 --> 36:38.982
Okay.

36:41.950 --> 36:43.282
What do you want from me, Cecile?

36:43.368 --> 36:46.702
I want to know why me having
these powers is so upsetting to you.

36:46.788 --> 36:47.869
You have the powers. Read my mind.

36:47.956 --> 36:49.072
Uh-uh. No. No, no.

36:49.165 --> 36:52.499
Me reading your thoughts
is what got us into all of this.

36:52.669 --> 36:54.626
I want to know how you feel.

37:03.888 --> 37:07.723
Cecile, you being able
to read my thoughts...

37:10.478 --> 37:13.562
It makes me feel vulnerable
in a way that I don't like.

37:13.690 --> 37:20.153
You being able to hear
every scared, dumb thought of mine,

37:20.697 --> 37:23.690
I just don't want you
seeing me like that.

37:23.908 --> 37:25.490
But I would never think less of you

37:25.744 --> 37:26.734
for the thoughts
that cross your mind.

37:26.953 --> 37:28.114
How could you not?

37:30.749 --> 37:32.081
Okay.

37:34.294 --> 37:37.253
Joe, your Grandma Esther's noodles,
they taste terrible.

37:37.422 --> 37:38.708
Okay, they are terrible.

37:38.798 --> 37:41.165
That woman had no business
ever messing with a wok.

37:41.259 --> 37:42.420
Wow. Okay. Wow.

37:42.510 --> 37:45.878
And I think that I've been using
semicolons wrong my entire life

37:45.972 --> 37:47.304
which leads me to believe

37:47.390 --> 37:49.803
that I don't even know
what a semicolon actually is.

37:49.893 --> 37:53.261
Also, I would like to buy
a new pair of pants, 'cause...

37:53.354 --> 37:55.437
But I haven't yet 'cause I'm afraid
to go into the store

37:55.523 --> 37:56.934
'cause I think the salesperson
is gonna judge me

37:57.025 --> 38:00.439
because, truthfully, even I think
that I am just a little bit crazy

38:00.528 --> 38:02.645
for having another baby at this age.

38:02.739 --> 38:03.900
Oh, baby.

38:05.742 --> 38:07.699
You are not crazy.

38:09.496 --> 38:13.240
That speech you just gave
was a little, but you're not.

38:13.875 --> 38:17.243
Those are my scared,
dumb, vulnerable thoughts.

38:18.338 --> 38:19.624
You think any less of me?

38:20.048 --> 38:21.755
- Of course not.
- Mmm-mmm.

38:23.134 --> 38:27.378
Look, I can't promise you that
I'm gonna stop reading your mind.

38:27.514 --> 38:29.927
I don't even really know
how this all works yet.

38:30.850 --> 38:33.467
But I can promise you

38:33.561 --> 38:36.554
that nothing you ever think
will change my opinion of you.

38:38.316 --> 38:40.603
And even when you're not thinking it,

38:40.693 --> 38:45.233
I know that you are
the brave, brilliant,

38:45.323 --> 38:47.861
devastatingly handsome man
that I love.

38:47.951 --> 38:51.319
And the one thought
I hear you have the most

38:52.163 --> 38:53.950
is that you love me, too.

38:55.291 --> 38:57.078
- And I do.
- Yeah.

39:05.426 --> 39:07.088
Based on my scans,

39:07.178 --> 39:10.512
Ralph and Cisco's cells
have re-formed and re-stabilized.

39:10.598 --> 39:13.090
I can attest my bladder
is completely back to normal.

39:13.226 --> 39:14.808
- Fourth Big Gulp today.
- Hmm.

39:14.936 --> 39:17.519
I miss when we could just pick him up
and carry him out of the room.

39:17.605 --> 39:18.721
Right?

39:18.815 --> 39:22.104
Hey, you just passed up a dig
at Dibny. Sure you're all right?

39:22.193 --> 39:25.152
You know, we reopen a case
against an innocent man

39:25.238 --> 39:27.525
and, oh, somehow stumble upon
the actual culprit.

39:27.615 --> 39:29.607
A culprit who, by the way,
has meta-human powers

39:29.701 --> 39:31.863
that we are
partially responsible for...

39:31.953 --> 39:34.161
It's like you said.
There are no coincidences

39:34.247 --> 39:36.489
when it comes to DeVoe
and these bus metas.

39:36.583 --> 39:39.041
What's DeVoe doing?
What's his motive?

39:39.586 --> 39:41.452
Does he want
Sylbert Rundine incarcerated?

39:41.546 --> 39:43.162
Or to have Big Sir set free?

39:43.256 --> 39:45.418
Or for Cisco and I
to become itty-bitty meta-humans?

39:47.218 --> 39:50.336
Well, whatever his plan is,
we'll figure it out.

39:51.431 --> 39:52.672
And we're gonna stop him.

39:52.807 --> 39:53.968
And bring Barry home.

39:54.267 --> 39:56.350
And bring Barry home.

40:02.442 --> 40:04.149
On your feet, inmate.

40:06.321 --> 40:07.812
Is there a problem, Warden?

40:07.947 --> 40:11.111
As you know, inmate Ratchet
mysteriously disappeared last night.

40:11.200 --> 40:12.361
Where do you think he went?

40:13.161 --> 40:14.368
Well, I couldn't say.

40:14.621 --> 40:16.453
In an effort
to locate inmate Ratchet,

40:16.539 --> 40:18.701
I reviewed
the security camera footage.

40:18.833 --> 40:22.167
Did you know the oscillating cameras
aren't the only ones in this wing? Hmm?

40:23.212 --> 40:26.080
Once you started stroking
inmate Ratchet's hopes of freedom,

40:26.174 --> 40:28.086
I had a camera installed
right by your cell.

40:32.472 --> 40:34.179
And when I checked that camera,

40:34.807 --> 40:36.389
I learned who you truly are.

40:38.186 --> 40:40.303
I don't know
what you're talking about.

40:40.396 --> 40:42.183
Then let me be specific.

40:44.817 --> 40:46.058
You're the Flash.

40:47.946 --> 40:49.938
It's no use denying it
or trying to run.

40:50.406 --> 40:52.693
You're clearly already showing
the effects of the drug cocktail

40:52.784 --> 40:54.491
I put in that snack
you so seemed to enjoy.

40:57.872 --> 40:59.079
Why?

40:59.248 --> 41:00.455
Why would you do this?

41:07.840 --> 41:09.081
I did warn you.

41:11.386 --> 41:13.252
Everyone in here is a monster.

41:34.033 --> 41:35.149
That'll be all.

41:44.544 --> 41:46.456
You said to call you
when I was ready to do business.

41:46.546 --> 41:50.256
Oh, hello, Warden.
Do you have another fish to sell me?

41:51.009 --> 41:52.090
I do.

41:53.261 --> 41:54.342
And it's a big one.
