- Thank you!
- See you, mate!

01:15.119 --> 01:18.200
Did you see him when we ordered
the tequilas? Not impressed!

01:18.239 --> 01:19.400
I'm so drunk!

01:54.280 --> 01:57.519
'We are now approaching
the island of Ternstone.

01:57.560 --> 02:00.839
Known locally as the
Galapagos of the North,

02:00.879 --> 02:03.079
it is home to around
20 species of seabirds

02:03.119 --> 02:06.159
and England's largest
colony of grey seals.

02:26.759 --> 02:28.680
Gemma!

03:03.800 --> 03:09.039
There she is. Gemma Wyatt, 28.
Northumbria Wildlife Trust, Ranger.

03:10.079 --> 03:12.159
And they're saying there's a boat missing?

03:12.200 --> 03:14.519
According to the woman who called it in.

03:22.759 --> 03:25.200
You feeling a bit peaky there, Tony?

03:26.400 --> 03:29.879
- I'm fine.
- A pathologist with a weak stomach.

03:42.400 --> 03:44.439
- Oh, come on!
- What?

03:44.479 --> 03:46.560
Well, they were told
to preserve the scene,

03:46.600 --> 03:48.879
not swarm all over it!

03:53.159 --> 03:55.159
What?

03:56.239 --> 04:00.400
- DCI Vera Stanhope.
- Sophia Ashbrook, team leader.

04:00.439 --> 04:02.680
- I spoke to your colleague.
- And they are?

04:03.879 --> 04:05.360
Vicki and Peter.

04:05.400 --> 04:07.720
She runs the Visitor
Centre and he's our intern.

04:07.759 --> 04:12.239
Right, now, this is a police incident
scene, not a tourist attraction.

04:12.280 --> 04:14.439
I want all those day-trippers
to sit in the boat

04:14.479 --> 04:16.079
and wait for us to take statements.

04:16.119 --> 04:20.039
I'm gonna need a team
going over this whole area.

04:20.079 --> 04:23.079
And no more boats on or off
the island without my say-so.

04:23.119 --> 04:25.639
- Where is she?
- This way.

04:35.479 --> 04:37.680
Are you sure the body
was actually washed up?

04:37.720 --> 04:39.920
- Yeah.
- Where?

04:44.319 --> 04:46.479
You were specifically told not to move it.

04:46.519 --> 04:48.639
I'm sorry, we couldn't stop him.

04:48.680 --> 04:52.200
- Who is he?
- Ryan, our boatman.

04:52.239 --> 04:54.239
He's her fiance.

05:11.519 --> 05:13.239
Right, come on, love.

05:15.720 --> 05:17.400
Ryan, isn't it?

05:17.439 --> 05:19.439
Yeah.

05:20.720 --> 05:22.720
I'm sorry, love.

05:25.239 --> 05:28.360
It's all right, I've got
her. We'll take care of her.

05:30.639 --> 05:33.239
Now, you and Gemma both live here?

05:33.280 --> 05:38.119
- Did you live on the island together?
- No. Well, she did, most of the year.

05:38.159 --> 05:40.479
We're doing up a house.

05:40.519 --> 05:42.879
- What, Ambersea?
- Aye.

05:42.920 --> 05:44.839
Right, we'll get you back over there.

05:44.879 --> 05:46.560
Aiden!

05:46.600 --> 05:49.800
Now, is there anyone you'd
like us to contact for you?

05:49.839 --> 05:52.079
- Family?
- It's just her sister. Alice.

05:52.119 --> 05:54.200
Would you prefer to speak to her or...?

05:54.239 --> 05:56.239
No. It's not really like that.

05:56.280 --> 05:58.280
OK.

06:00.239 --> 06:03.039
Make sure Family Liaison
are waiting for him.

06:04.800 --> 06:07.000
Come on. It might be a little way.

06:21.479 --> 06:22.439
Tony?

06:22.479 --> 06:26.119
Significant head injury, but I'm not
sure if it's pre or post mortem yet.

06:26.159 --> 06:28.039
Er, no obvious broken bones,

06:28.079 --> 06:30.439
but these tears and the
abrasions do suggest

06:30.479 --> 06:32.519
that she was washed up onto the rocks.

06:32.560 --> 06:36.000
- So it could be misadventure, then?
- I don't think so.

06:36.039 --> 06:37.560
Er, not with these.

06:37.600 --> 06:40.239
Thumb that side, fingers there.

06:40.280 --> 06:42.000
What, strangulation?

06:42.039 --> 06:44.360
Either that, or she was held under water.

06:46.200 --> 06:48.680
So, any idea when she died?

06:48.720 --> 06:51.200
Rigor seems to be fairly well established,

06:51.239 --> 06:53.360
so, provisionally...

06:53.400 --> 06:57.600
I would say work with a window
of between 4pm and midnight...

06:57.639 --> 07:00.519
- Right, thanks.
- But that is just my best guess.

07:00.560 --> 07:02.560
It's better than mine.

07:07.800 --> 07:09.800
It was here yesterday.

07:10.959 --> 07:14.479
- What model is it?
- Zodiac dinghy, 13-foot.

07:16.239 --> 07:18.360
She knew not to use it alone at night.

07:18.400 --> 07:21.680
- We don't know for sure
she did use it. - Really?

07:21.720 --> 07:24.079
Because the boat's missing and she's dead!

07:26.839 --> 07:30.400
I'm sorry. It feels like
they're under my care.

07:30.439 --> 07:34.000
If Gemma did take the boat,
where would she be going?

07:34.039 --> 07:35.879
No idea.

07:35.920 --> 07:39.879
- Unless she was coming to meet us.
- Meet you where?

07:39.920 --> 07:43.319
The Anchor pub. It was my leaving
do, so we stayed overnight.

07:43.360 --> 07:45.920
But someone had to stay
here to do evening obs.

07:45.959 --> 07:48.839
So Gemma was here on her own last night?

07:48.879 --> 07:50.879
She volunteered.

07:52.039 --> 07:53.920
So where did you last see her?

07:53.959 --> 07:56.280
She was working up there,
in the observation hut.

07:56.319 --> 07:58.239
We saw her from the boat.

07:58.280 --> 08:00.159
And what time was this?

08:00.200 --> 08:03.920
It was the last boat out, so around five.

08:05.119 --> 08:07.519
You must get a lot of
visitors here, peak season.

08:07.560 --> 08:09.680
Hundreds every day. Why?

08:09.720 --> 08:12.319
Could one of them have
stayed behind on the island?

08:12.360 --> 08:14.680
- Missed the boat?
- No.

08:14.720 --> 08:17.200
They're counted on and counted off.

08:17.239 --> 08:19.639
When we left the island,
she was on her own.

08:26.360 --> 08:28.000
Me and Jamil are upstairs.

08:28.039 --> 08:32.000
And... that one's Gemma's
room, at the end there.

08:32.039 --> 08:35.560
- Right. So who's Jamil?
- A PhD student.

08:35.600 --> 08:38.039
He's back on the mainland today, though.

08:47.920 --> 08:52.000
- Did Gemma talk much about her fiance?
- She talked about the wedding.

08:52.039 --> 08:54.000
A favourite topic of conversation, that.

08:54.039 --> 08:57.639
- Bit of a bridezilla, was she?
- No, she was all right.

08:57.680 --> 09:00.600
She was a good laugh, you
know? Proper down to earth.

09:02.239 --> 09:04.639
Anyone visit Gemma on the island?

09:04.680 --> 09:07.119
Not unless you count Ryan,
with the boat tours.

09:07.159 --> 09:09.439
Do you know when they'll
be able to start up again?

09:09.479 --> 09:11.360
No, love, it's police boats only for now.

09:11.400 --> 09:13.600
But we can give you a lift
across if you need to...

09:13.639 --> 09:15.959
Oh, it's all right. I was just wondering.

09:18.879 --> 09:20.920
Are there any other boats on the island?

09:20.959 --> 09:23.000
No, it was just the Zodiac.

09:23.039 --> 09:27.439
Were Gemma and Ryan happy? Everything OK?

09:29.560 --> 09:31.079
They were solid.

10:00.479 --> 10:04.039
She always wanted to work in
conservation, even at school.

10:04.079 --> 10:07.039
I mean, you must be pretty
dedicated to live here.

10:07.079 --> 10:10.560
I'm nine till five in the Visitor
Centre, then home to my dad's.

10:10.600 --> 10:13.879
So was there anything obviously missing?

10:13.920 --> 10:15.920
I don't think so.

10:16.720 --> 10:18.720
No.

10:20.439 --> 10:24.039
- Did Gemma do one of these yesterday?
- Ranger talk? Yeah. 3:30 till 4:00.

10:24.079 --> 10:26.200
Kids loved her.

10:26.239 --> 10:28.000
Did she mention anything unusual?

10:28.039 --> 10:30.439
Any worries? Any plans to meet someone?

10:30.479 --> 10:32.560
Nothing, no. She was just normal.

10:32.600 --> 10:35.280
- This is live?
- Yeah.

10:35.319 --> 10:38.079
That's Nest Cam. It's a 24-hour feed.

10:38.119 --> 10:40.519
- So it was running last night?
- Should've been.

10:40.560 --> 10:42.079
Peter!

10:42.119 --> 10:44.119
It's kind of his pet project.

10:46.159 --> 10:49.200
My officers will need to
download this footage, love.

10:49.280 --> 10:50.200
Sure.

10:50.239 --> 10:52.800
- Sorry, do you mind if I...?
- Yeah, you go on.

10:53.800 --> 10:55.800
Aiden.

10:56.759 --> 10:59.519
Find out if there's any way
to get on or off this island

10:59.560 --> 11:01.400
without using that jetty,

11:01.439 --> 11:05.400
because if there isn't, and
this camera was recording,

11:05.439 --> 11:08.119
we might be in business.

12:12.319 --> 12:15.920
Can we get in a bit closer, see
if there's any way to land?

12:15.959 --> 12:18.560
Not if you want this boat
to stay in one piece.

12:49.280 --> 12:52.159
But if that jetty is the
only place on Ternstone

12:52.200 --> 12:54.680
- where you can launch or land a boat...
- Definitely is.

12:54.720 --> 12:57.000
.. then either she or the
killer must've used it.

12:57.039 --> 12:59.239
- Is that footage on the
way to Kenny? - Yeah.

12:59.280 --> 13:01.119
Now, get onto the harbour master,

13:01.159 --> 13:04.159
see if he's aware of any
comings or goings overnight.

13:04.800 --> 13:07.879
And see what you can find
out about Peter Haden.

13:07.920 --> 13:09.920
- Their intern?
- Mm.

13:09.959 --> 13:11.959
Just see what turns up.

13:13.600 --> 13:15.680
Have you got the address of this sister?

13:15.720 --> 13:18.839
- It's, er, Wyatt Farm.
- Right.

13:44.360 --> 13:47.119
- Alice Wyatt?
- Yeah.

14:03.039 --> 14:06.239
I'm DCI Vera Stanhope.

14:06.280 --> 14:08.839
And this is DS Healy.

14:10.159 --> 14:12.800
We need to talk to you
about your sister Gemma.

14:12.839 --> 14:14.839
What does she want?

14:19.839 --> 14:21.879
'Ey, I am so sorry, love.

14:24.360 --> 14:26.720
They found her this morning.

14:35.839 --> 14:37.839
There you are, love.

14:44.079 --> 14:48.159
- Was it just you and Gemma?
- Since Mam died, yeah.

14:48.200 --> 14:50.200
No other family?

14:51.200 --> 14:53.239
Her boyfriend knows, does he?

14:53.280 --> 14:55.479
Oh, Ryan was on the boat that found her.

14:55.519 --> 14:57.519
Course he was.

14:58.800 --> 15:01.959
- Why do you say that?
- Dunno.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
He's just always there.

15:07.039 --> 15:10.360
Can you think of anyone who
might've wanted to hurt Gemma?

15:10.400 --> 15:13.119
No. Why, are you saying it was deliberate?

15:13.159 --> 15:15.879
Well, that's just what
we're trying to find out.

15:17.839 --> 15:21.280
Did she mention any problems
with her relationship?

15:21.319 --> 15:22.920
- Work?
- No.

15:22.959 --> 15:24.959
What about her friends?

15:25.000 --> 15:27.600
I get I should be the
person to answer this stuff,

15:27.639 --> 15:30.079
but I'm not. I was hardly
in contact with her.

15:30.119 --> 15:32.639
- Had something happened?
- Not really.

15:32.680 --> 15:34.959
We were always very different.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.959
Even as kids.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
In what way, different?

15:40.479 --> 15:43.000
Well, she couldn't wait to
get away from this place.

15:43.039 --> 15:46.439
And then when Dad left,
she started lashing out.

15:46.479 --> 15:49.039
- Physically?
- No.

15:49.079 --> 15:51.079
But she knew how to be cruel.

15:55.560 --> 15:58.959
Was there anyone she
might have confided in?

15:59.000 --> 16:01.680
Like I said, you're
asking the wrong person.

16:04.039 --> 16:07.159
What did she mean "he's
always there" about Ryan?

16:07.200 --> 16:09.439
She doesn't seem to like anyone, does she?

16:09.479 --> 16:12.239
No contact with her family and
she lives all the way out here.

16:12.280 --> 16:14.319
Well, some people prefer
to be on their own.

16:14.360 --> 16:16.039
When are we seeing Ryan?

16:16.079 --> 16:18.560
His GP has asked if we
can wait till tomorrow.

16:18.600 --> 16:20.600
See if you can speed that up.

16:48.839 --> 16:51.159
The head injury happened
just before she died,

16:51.239 --> 16:53.000
but the cause of death was drowning.

16:53.079 --> 16:55.000
Definitely murder?

16:55.079 --> 16:57.759
I'd say so, and not just because
of the marks on her neck.

16:57.839 --> 17:00.159
The way the lividity has fixed suggests

17:00.239 --> 17:03.360
that her body was kept
somewhere for several hours.

17:06.119 --> 17:08.639
See those white patches on her thighs?

17:08.720 --> 17:10.439
- Yeah, what's that?
- Pressure points.

17:10.519 --> 17:13.400
Wherever her body was kept,
it was in a seated position.

17:13.479 --> 17:16.519
What, they drowned her,
then kept her sat somewhere?

17:16.600 --> 17:18.600
Sat or slumped.

17:20.079 --> 17:22.600
Bottom of a boat, taking her out to sea?

17:22.680 --> 17:25.360
I will leave that one with you, Detective.

17:27.319 --> 17:32.800
Gemma Wyatt. Last seen alive by her
colleagues at five o'clock yesterday,

17:32.879 --> 17:35.319
when she was apparently
alone on the island.

17:35.400 --> 17:37.280
I've been looking at tidal patterns,

17:37.360 --> 17:40.639
but it's gonna be very difficult
to work out where her body went in.

17:40.720 --> 17:44.119
- Anything from the harbour master?
- No CCTV down there.

17:44.200 --> 17:46.159
Well, the killer might not be local.

17:46.239 --> 17:48.200
Could've come to the island from anywhere.

17:48.280 --> 17:49.959
If they even went to the island.

17:50.039 --> 17:52.879
Gemma could've gone to the
mainland, met her killer there,

17:52.959 --> 17:55.159
and still got washed up on Ternstone.

17:56.839 --> 18:00.119
- I assume there's no sign of
this missing boat... - Nothing.

18:00.200 --> 18:03.479
So we've no idea where
the scene of crime is.

18:03.560 --> 18:06.000
No idea how she got this head injury,

18:06.079 --> 18:09.800
where her body was kept or where
it was disposed of. Brilliant.

18:09.879 --> 18:13.079
We do know she was having a
massive row with her sister.

18:13.680 --> 18:15.439
- Do we?
- It's all in her emails.

18:15.519 --> 18:18.079
Gemma wanted to sell the farm,
but Alice wouldn't budge.

18:18.159 --> 18:20.360
They're getting into
lawyers, court orders.

18:20.439 --> 18:23.280
- Alice is accusing Ryan of stalking.
- What do you mean -- stalking?

18:23.360 --> 18:26.159
Shining a torch through her window
at night, letting sheep out.

18:26.239 --> 18:28.800
Alice reckons they're
intimidating her into selling.

18:28.879 --> 18:32.519
We've got a suspected arson
at Wyatt Farm over Easter.

18:32.600 --> 18:37.000
"Alice Wyatt accusing sister's
boyfriend, Ryan Campbell."

18:46.200 --> 18:49.519
Sounds like we've got the Rangers'
boat. A fishing trawler's found it.

18:49.600 --> 18:52.759
- They're bringing it in.
- Hallelujah! Progress.

18:53.839 --> 18:55.479
Get SOCO on to it.

18:55.560 --> 18:57.959
What about Peter Haden?
His name flag anything up?

18:58.039 --> 19:00.039
He's not showing in the system.

19:02.879 --> 19:04.920
- You looking for Ryan?
- Yeah.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.200
I'm Michael Hogarth, his godfather.

19:07.280 --> 19:10.159
- Hogarth? Vicki's dad?
- Yeah.

19:10.239 --> 19:12.159
Come on through.

19:12.239 --> 19:15.000
- Ryan's out the back.
- Right. Thanks.

19:24.680 --> 19:27.280
How are you feeling?

19:27.360 --> 19:29.360
Oh. Silly question.

19:31.639 --> 19:34.519
- Pretty garden.
- Ah, it's Gemma's doing.

19:36.360 --> 19:38.360
She used to leave me instructions.

19:39.800 --> 19:42.879
- How long had you been together?
- Five years.

19:43.920 --> 19:47.159
I met her when we stopped fishing
and started doing the boat tours.

19:48.519 --> 19:52.280
She was so easy to talk
to. She made me laugh.

19:55.479 --> 19:59.000
Must have been difficult with her
on the island for half the year.

19:59.079 --> 20:03.680
She always said that's why we got
on so well -- hardly saw each other!

20:04.720 --> 20:06.680
I have to inform you, Ryan,

20:06.759 --> 20:09.639
that we're treating Gemma's
death as suspicious.

20:10.959 --> 20:12.600
What?

20:12.680 --> 20:14.959
So if she was involved in anything,

20:15.039 --> 20:17.519
in any kind of trouble, we need to know.

20:18.879 --> 20:22.439
She wasn't involved in anything.
What do you even mean by that?

20:22.519 --> 20:25.879
- Well, had she fallen
out with anyone? - No.

20:27.439 --> 20:29.439
Mm.

20:31.439 --> 20:34.400
- When did you last see her?
- Yesterday afternoon.

20:34.479 --> 20:38.680
Like, not to speak to, but
we always did this thing.

20:38.759 --> 20:43.280
If I saw her from the boat, then I'd
sound the horn and send her a text.

20:44.360 --> 20:46.920
And... she texted straight back.

20:48.039 --> 20:50.039
See?

20:51.519 --> 20:53.519
Message received 5:08pm.

20:58.720 --> 21:01.280
Where were you last night?

21:01.360 --> 21:03.759
- Oh, come on, now.
- I'm sorry, love.

21:03.839 --> 21:05.839
I need to know.

21:07.519 --> 21:12.159
I was at Sophia's leaving do
till 11:00 and then back here.

21:12.239 --> 21:14.839
Did you leave with anyone else?

21:14.920 --> 21:17.479
They were all still on it when I left.

21:19.159 --> 21:22.079
Well, I will need to see inside the house.

21:23.280 --> 21:25.680
- You can stay here if you want.
- That's fine.

21:34.759 --> 21:40.119
Erm, did Gemma keep another laptop
here? Or mobile phone? Diaries?

21:40.200 --> 21:43.039
Well, she used to keep all
her stuff on the island.

21:45.039 --> 21:47.720
Do you mind if my sergeant
has a little look round?

21:47.800 --> 21:49.600
If you need to.

21:51.560 --> 21:53.000
Could I ask you about Alice?

21:53.079 --> 21:56.280
Now, you told me Gemma
hadn't fallen out with anyone.

21:57.319 --> 22:00.360
Well, that was just sisters.
I tried not to get involved.

22:00.439 --> 22:03.239
Well, Alice seems to think
you're very much involved.

22:03.319 --> 22:07.319
Court orders. Accusations
of stalking. Arson!

22:07.400 --> 22:09.839
And that you and Gemma
wanted her off that farm.

22:09.920 --> 22:12.360
I wasn't stalking her.

22:12.439 --> 22:15.479
And I definitely didn't
set fire to anything.

22:15.560 --> 22:17.239
We did want her to sell.

22:17.319 --> 22:20.159
Because living out there,
in the middle of nowhere,

22:20.239 --> 22:22.239
it's messing with her head.

22:23.839 --> 22:27.839
Find out if Alice has got a
boat. And get forensics on his.

22:27.920 --> 22:30.839
Whatever was going on
between those two sisters,

22:30.920 --> 22:32.959
he was right in the middle of it.

22:33.039 --> 22:34.800
And can you keep off that thing

22:34.879 --> 22:36.800
whilst we're interviewing the bereaved?

22:36.879 --> 22:39.720
Sorry. It's just that my missus
is having a hard time with Max.

22:39.800 --> 22:41.479
He's still not sleeping through.

22:41.560 --> 22:43.600
Now, I'm going to see Tony.

22:43.680 --> 22:46.759
I'll drop you off at the harbour.
You can wait for that trawler.

22:46.839 --> 22:50.119
And give your missus a
hand when you get home.

22:50.200 --> 22:52.479
Well, I've already offered
to cook cheesy pasta.

22:52.560 --> 22:54.639
Ooh! Someone call MasterChef.

23:00.239 --> 23:02.560
Was it an Ambersea
trawler that picked it up?

23:02.639 --> 23:06.000
They found it drifting nine
miles along the coast from here.

23:07.280 --> 23:09.680
Better give the boss a
timeframe for forensics.

23:09.759 --> 23:13.079
- She'll want it yesterday.
- Will do.

23:15.239 --> 23:16.479
Jamil, isn't it?

23:16.560 --> 23:19.560
- We spoke on the phone earlier.
- That's definitely ours.

23:33.759 --> 23:37.639
Here. 13-foot Zodiac and
serial number's there.

23:37.720 --> 23:40.159
Great. Thanks.

23:40.239 --> 23:45.079
- Big night last night, was it?
- Er, Sophia's leaving party.

23:45.159 --> 23:48.319
- What time did you leave?
- No idea.

23:48.400 --> 23:50.400
Whatever time they chucked us out.

23:51.360 --> 23:53.319
Me and Vicki ended up crashing.

23:53.400 --> 23:56.360
- But you're usually based
on the island? - Yeah.

23:57.639 --> 24:01.439
Wish I'd stayed there last
night, let Gemma go to the party.

24:01.519 --> 24:03.720
There's no point torturing
yourself with "what if".

24:03.800 --> 24:06.439
That's what she would have said.

24:06.519 --> 24:10.800
- Was everything OK with Gemma?
- I think so.

24:10.879 --> 24:14.879
- She wasn't anxious about anything?
- Gemma didn't do anxious.

24:14.959 --> 24:16.639
She was pretty sure of herself.

24:16.720 --> 24:20.600
Well, not in a bad way.
Just like positive, you know?

24:21.639 --> 24:24.720
OK. Thanks for digging this out.

24:24.800 --> 24:27.079
I'll be in touch if we need anything else.

24:27.839 --> 24:30.039
You will find out what happened to her?

24:31.239 --> 24:33.239
We'll do everything we can.

24:42.280 --> 24:44.319
Your starter for ten, what do you see?

24:44.400 --> 24:47.319
A pathologist wasting my
time with daft questions.

24:47.400 --> 24:50.119
- What am I looking at?
- They're diatoms.

24:50.200 --> 24:52.920
Tiny particles of algae
inhaled as she drowned.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.039
They eventually show
up in the bone marrow.

24:55.119 --> 24:56.800
OK.

24:56.879 --> 24:59.920
- So, further proof that she drowned.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
They are proof of where she drowned.

25:02.079 --> 25:04.720
This is a freshwater
species and... hornwort.

25:04.800 --> 25:08.280
Also freshwater. Found in miniscule
fragments under her fingernails.

25:13.159 --> 25:16.839
Aiden, pasta's cancelled. I think
I know where she was killed.

25:21.560 --> 25:26.680
This is the only freshwater on the
island. You see that? Hornwort.

25:26.759 --> 25:29.600
We'll need a sample of
this water for Tony.

25:29.680 --> 25:34.479
And get a search team up here now.
Tell 'em we've found our crime scene.

25:35.560 --> 25:39.000
So she was killed here, then her
body sat in a boat for hours?

25:48.879 --> 25:51.360
Just this little bit
here has been cleaned.

26:04.639 --> 26:06.119
Hornwort.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.200
Hornwort on the seat.

26:11.479 --> 26:14.200
And if that turns out to be blood...

26:18.119 --> 26:19.800
What did the Rangers say

26:19.879 --> 26:22.319
in their written statements
about seeing her here?

26:22.400 --> 26:25.680
They all said the same -- they saw
her from the boat at five o'clock.

26:25.759 --> 26:27.720
Re-interview them.

26:27.800 --> 26:30.079
Did they actually see her move?

26:30.159 --> 26:32.800
Because if they didn't,

26:32.879 --> 26:36.000
when they saw her sat here,
Gemma was already dead.

26:49.479 --> 26:54.159
So, we now know where Gemma
Wyatt was killed and when.

26:54.239 --> 26:56.079
Tony just confirmed it.

26:56.159 --> 26:59.959
The water in the pond contains the
same algae he found in her system.

27:00.039 --> 27:02.039
Time of death 4:00 to 5:00.

27:02.119 --> 27:04.079
The Rangers saw her alive after that,

27:04.159 --> 27:06.039
and she sent that text to her fiance.

27:06.119 --> 27:09.920
No, a text was sent to the
fiance. We don't know by whom.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.280
Now, Aiden's talked to the Rangers again.

27:12.360 --> 27:15.519
They could see it was Gemma and
they assumed she was alive.

27:15.600 --> 27:19.159
But she was at a distance. None
of them actually saw her move.

27:19.239 --> 27:22.039
AND they've found traces of
blood in the observation hut.

27:22.119 --> 27:23.759
DNA says it's Gemma's.

27:23.839 --> 27:28.600
Now, we know Gemma finished her
talk in the Visitor Centre at four.

27:28.680 --> 27:31.400
By five, she'd been drowned in this pond

27:31.479 --> 27:34.079
and her body taken to the observation hut.

27:34.159 --> 27:37.600
So we're looking for someone who was
on the island on Tuesday afternoon.

27:37.680 --> 27:41.000
I've already got a list. They had
nearly a hundred people that day.

27:41.079 --> 27:44.360
And I'm gonna need you lot to track
down every single one of them.

27:44.439 --> 27:46.360
Were any of them connected to Gemma?

27:46.439 --> 27:48.800
Did they make repeated
visits to the island?

27:48.879 --> 27:52.039
Photos, videos taken that
day -- I want copies.

27:52.119 --> 27:54.920
Hicham, I want you to
concentrate on the colleagues --

27:55.000 --> 27:56.879
the Rangers and the boatmen.

27:56.959 --> 28:00.200
I wanna know exactly where they
were between four and five o'clock.

28:00.280 --> 28:02.280
- Yes, ma'am.
- You can start with this fella --

28:02.360 --> 28:04.039
the intern, Peter Haden.

28:04.119 --> 28:06.759
He seems particularly
interested in what we're doing.

28:06.839 --> 28:09.119
So, where are we with Gemma's mobile?

28:09.200 --> 28:12.639
Still no sign of it, but that text
to Ryan was sent from the island,

28:12.720 --> 28:14.680
or somewhere very nearby.

28:21.680 --> 28:23.479
Theories, anyone?

28:23.560 --> 28:26.200
The killer stayed on the
island after everyone left,

28:26.280 --> 28:29.239
took Gemma's body out to
sea on the Rangers' boat.

28:29.319 --> 28:32.759
That sounds doable. Then dumped the
boat, make it look like an accident.

28:32.839 --> 28:35.959
So how did they get themselves
back to the mainland? Hm? Swim?

28:36.039 --> 28:37.680
Not in that current.

28:37.759 --> 28:39.759
You couldn't do this
without your own boat.

28:39.839 --> 28:42.519
Perhaps they left with everyone
on the five o'clock boat

28:42.600 --> 28:45.639
- and then came back later.
- Yeah, but in all these scenarios,

28:45.720 --> 28:49.200
we would have seen the killer
coming or going on that camera.

28:49.280 --> 28:51.159
I've checked it twice now, ma'am.

28:51.239 --> 28:53.839
Like I said, there's nothing
on that jetty after five.

28:53.920 --> 28:56.479
They must've had another
route on and off the island.

28:56.560 --> 28:58.920
Even if you could moor your
boat without wrecking it,

28:59.000 --> 29:01.200
you'd have to be Spiderman
to climb those cliffs.

29:01.280 --> 29:02.920
Then maybe they came in by air.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.959
Oh, so we're looking
for Batman now, are we?

29:05.039 --> 29:07.439
I've got something else. Davy Andersen,

29:07.519 --> 29:09.560
that guy whose name you saw on the plaque.

29:09.639 --> 29:12.360
- Mm?
- He was a Ranger on Ternstone.

29:12.439 --> 29:15.439
He died there in a climbing
accident four years ago.

29:15.519 --> 29:18.800
- Did he?
- Gemma was at the inquest.

29:18.879 --> 29:21.560
- What was the ruling?
- Accidental death.

29:21.639 --> 29:24.039
He was trying to reach up to a nest,

29:24.119 --> 29:26.479
messed up tying his safety line.

29:26.560 --> 29:29.560
But his parents went to the paper,

29:29.639 --> 29:31.319
claiming negligence.

29:31.400 --> 29:33.079
Gareth and Caroline Andersen.

29:33.159 --> 29:35.439
I searched the visitors
log for the island.

29:35.519 --> 29:37.519
They were there on Tuesday.

29:39.400 --> 29:41.400
Nice work, Helen.

30:12.519 --> 30:15.920
- Oh, we're looking for Mr Andersen...
- I'm his wife. Can I help?

30:18.280 --> 30:21.000
DCI Vera Stanhope. This is DS Healy.

30:21.079 --> 30:23.839
We're here to talk about
an incident on Ternstone.

30:23.920 --> 30:25.959
A young lady died there on Tuesday.

30:26.039 --> 30:28.560
Oh, God. One of the visitors?

30:28.639 --> 30:31.759
No, one of the Rangers. Gemma Wyatt?

30:35.400 --> 30:37.079
I know who she is.

30:39.119 --> 30:41.119
Come through.

30:45.280 --> 30:48.759
What are you doing? The estate
agent's coming at 11:00.

30:48.839 --> 30:50.560
Sorry. School holidays.

30:51.920 --> 30:53.800
Gareth! The police are here.

31:03.800 --> 31:07.360
We go over there a few times
a year. Davy was happy there.

31:07.439 --> 31:09.479
It was his birthday last week.

31:09.560 --> 31:12.319
Did you have any contact with
Gemma during these visits?

31:12.400 --> 31:14.439
Not really. She stayed out of our way.

31:14.519 --> 31:16.560
- Why was that?
- Guilt.

31:16.639 --> 31:19.000
She gave evidence at Davy's inquest.

31:19.079 --> 31:21.119
Her and Sophia Ashbrook.

31:21.200 --> 31:22.439
- And they lied.
- Gareth.

31:22.519 --> 31:25.159
He'd climbed since he was eight.
He knew what he was doing.

31:25.239 --> 31:27.560
There must've been an
issue with the equipment.

31:27.639 --> 31:29.439
Which you think they covered up?

31:30.479 --> 31:32.079
We'll never know now, will we?

31:32.159 --> 31:34.319
And it sounds like it's happened again.

31:34.400 --> 31:36.680
Oh, no, Gemma's death wasn't an accident.

31:36.759 --> 31:39.159
We believe there was
someone else involved.

31:39.239 --> 31:41.360
So that's why you're here.

31:41.439 --> 31:43.439
We're piecing together where everyone was

31:43.519 --> 31:45.039
between four and five o'clock,

31:45.119 --> 31:47.200
speaking to everyone
who visited the island.

31:47.280 --> 31:50.519
Making a special trip to see
them all in person, are you?

31:50.600 --> 31:53.879
Vicki took us over to Davy's
memorial in the afternoon.

31:53.959 --> 31:56.400
We were back on the beach by
four, waiting for the boat.

31:56.479 --> 31:59.600
Tourists aren't allowed there during
nesting but she lets us go over.

31:59.680 --> 32:01.639
What time did you get home?

32:01.720 --> 32:03.759
We didn't. We always
stay over in Ambersea.

32:03.839 --> 32:05.759
At the Westcliff Hotel.

32:05.839 --> 32:08.079
So you didn't see Gemma at all on Tuesday?

32:08.159 --> 32:10.319
- No.
- I did.

32:10.400 --> 32:13.800
I watched the lunchtime boat come
in while you were in the bathroom.

32:13.879 --> 32:16.839
Gemma got on and started
arguing with the guy driving it.

32:16.920 --> 32:19.319
- What about?
- No idea.

32:19.400 --> 32:22.119
Ask Vicki. She seemed to calm them down.

32:23.560 --> 32:26.759
Well, thanks very much.
You've been very helpful.

32:26.839 --> 32:28.519
Where are you going?

32:28.600 --> 32:31.200
No-one was "very helpful"
when it was our son.

33:06.959 --> 33:09.200
Her father definitely said St Mark's.

33:10.959 --> 33:13.839
Don't worry, everything
will be fine. Take care.

33:17.360 --> 33:19.360
Hi.

33:23.400 --> 33:25.479
It's an open meeting for relatives.

33:25.560 --> 33:27.959
I'm not actually, you know.

33:28.039 --> 33:29.800
None of our business, love.

33:29.879 --> 33:32.639
I come because my dad won't.

33:33.639 --> 33:36.360
Now, we just wanted to talk
to you about the Andersens.

33:36.439 --> 33:38.159
- I think you know them...
- Yeah.

33:38.239 --> 33:42.360
I was kind of their official guide
on the island -- bit more neutral.

33:42.439 --> 33:44.519
Do their visits cause a problem, then?

33:44.600 --> 33:47.039
Gareth kept taking photos
of where it happened,

33:47.119 --> 33:51.039
wanting Gemma and Sophia
to keep going over it.

33:51.119 --> 33:54.479
Got to the point where Ryan had to
warn us if he saw him on the boat.

33:55.680 --> 33:57.039
Mm.

33:57.119 --> 34:00.639
Did you ever see Mr Andersen

34:00.720 --> 34:04.079
behave threateningly towards Gemma?

34:04.159 --> 34:05.720
- God, no.
- No?

34:05.800 --> 34:07.479
He'd never hurt anyone.

34:07.560 --> 34:09.680
He's just... broken.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.119
I saw it with my dad after my sister died.

34:13.200 --> 34:15.000
Ah, I'm sorry.

34:15.079 --> 34:19.839
Anorexia. That's when
Dad started drinking.

34:19.920 --> 34:21.680
It's the same with Davy's parents.

34:21.759 --> 34:25.639
You... lose a child, you never
really come back from it.

34:27.800 --> 34:31.159
So on Tuesday, you took them to
their son's memorial on the cliff.

34:31.239 --> 34:33.800
- What time was that?
- Er, just after lunch.

34:33.879 --> 34:36.959
- Did you stay with them?
- No, I had to get back to the Visitor Centre.

34:37.039 --> 34:39.239
Then I was stuck there
till we closed at five.

34:39.319 --> 34:42.000
- Did you see them in the
evening at all? - No.

34:42.079 --> 34:44.879
We believe they were staying in Ambersea.

34:44.959 --> 34:47.879
I was in The Anchor all
night for Sophia's party.

34:49.839 --> 34:50.959
What time did you go home?

34:51.039 --> 34:53.119
Er... well, I didn't, really.

34:53.200 --> 34:57.159
I sort of ended up in
the office with Jamil.

34:57.239 --> 35:01.759
Why didn't you tell us Gemma argued
with her fiance the day she died?

35:02.800 --> 35:04.400
- Sorry?
- You were seen on the boat,

35:04.479 --> 35:07.079
breaking up a row between Ryan and her.

35:07.159 --> 35:10.560
That wasn't Ryan. That was my dad.

35:10.639 --> 35:13.119
Gemma could see he was drunk. She lost it.

35:13.200 --> 35:15.519
And you intervened?

35:15.600 --> 35:18.400
Well, she was right, really.
He was putting people at risk.

35:18.479 --> 35:20.119
I got her to back off.

35:20.200 --> 35:21.800
How did you do that?

35:21.879 --> 35:24.600
I told her it's not gonna
be an issue much longer.

35:24.680 --> 35:26.680
Dad's been drinking since Beth died.

35:26.759 --> 35:29.159
The consultant said he's got six months.

35:33.439 --> 35:35.200
Hicham just spoke to Michael.

35:35.280 --> 35:37.680
He was on the island again
between 4:30 and 5:00.

35:37.759 --> 35:39.600
He went over with Ryan on the last boat.

35:39.680 --> 35:43.879
Right. On the way, you can ring
that hotel the Andersens stayed at,

35:43.959 --> 35:45.560
check their movements overnight.

35:45.639 --> 35:47.360
You really think they were capable?

35:47.439 --> 35:51.400
Well, they weren't just mourning
their son on that island.

35:51.479 --> 35:53.800
I think they were looking for evidence.

36:07.720 --> 36:09.839
Mr Hogarth.

36:12.319 --> 36:14.800
People keep asking when it's re-opening.

36:14.879 --> 36:17.839
- Any idea?
- Oh, not any time soon, pet.

36:17.920 --> 36:22.759
But if you wanna speed it up, you
could try telling us the truth.

36:24.639 --> 36:29.680
When I spoke to you yesterday, I
asked if Gemma had rowed with anyone.

36:29.759 --> 36:31.959
- Do you remember?
- Yes.

36:32.039 --> 36:33.839
And you said...

36:33.920 --> 36:35.839
I didn't want to say in front of Ryan.

36:35.920 --> 36:38.159
And I just had the one.

36:38.239 --> 36:41.519
You were seen rowing with a
young woman who is now dead,

36:41.600 --> 36:45.360
and you lied about it. Now, can you
see why I have a problem with that?

36:45.439 --> 36:47.119
She was rowing with me.

36:47.200 --> 36:49.839
Look, I've known Gemma for years.

36:49.920 --> 36:51.879
The kids were all at school together.

36:51.959 --> 36:53.839
She flares up, then it's forgotten.

36:53.920 --> 36:57.560
You were also on the boat that
arrived at 4:30. Did you go ashore?

36:57.639 --> 37:01.079
No. Someone has to stay with the
boat, start letting people on.

37:01.159 --> 37:02.920
Would any passengers remember you?

37:03.000 --> 37:05.280
There was a family with
twin girls. I talked to them.

37:05.360 --> 37:07.839
And was Ryan on the boat this whole time?

37:07.920 --> 37:10.079
We had some deliveries for the lighthouse,

37:10.159 --> 37:12.039
so he was back and forth from the boat.

37:12.119 --> 37:15.159
And it was just the two of you on
the boat when you left the mainland?

37:15.239 --> 37:16.400
Yes.

37:16.479 --> 37:19.600
Alice wanted a lift, but
Ryan wasn't having any of it.

37:19.680 --> 37:22.159
If you wanted to see a proper argument...

37:22.239 --> 37:25.400
Alice Wyatt was trying
to get over to the island?

37:29.280 --> 37:31.439
Nothing, ma'am.

37:45.800 --> 37:47.800
Hello?

37:54.479 --> 37:56.159
Alice?

38:21.560 --> 38:24.519
I didn't mean no contact at
all. I meant I hadn't seen her.

38:24.600 --> 38:27.360
Yeah, but you were trying
to see her the day she died.

38:27.439 --> 38:30.639
You asked Ryan to take
you over to the island.

38:30.720 --> 38:33.079
He said no. I just came
home. I was home all night.

38:33.159 --> 38:36.000
- Can anybody vouch for that?
- Is he serious?

38:36.079 --> 38:38.079
Looks painful.

38:39.159 --> 38:41.079
Juno went after a squirrel.

38:41.159 --> 38:43.360
I had to cut her out of some barbed wire.

38:43.439 --> 38:48.800
So what was so important you suddenly
had to see your sister face to face?

38:48.879 --> 38:51.759
- You've read the emails.
- So it was about the farm.

38:52.920 --> 38:56.879
Half of it's hers, she wants
to sell up, take it all away.

38:56.959 --> 38:59.000
- She wasn't the one driving it.
- Ryan?

38:59.079 --> 39:01.600
- Mm.
- Did Ryan bully Gemma?

39:01.680 --> 39:03.400
He had this way of pulling her strings.

39:03.479 --> 39:05.119
Especially when he wanted money.

39:05.200 --> 39:07.720
In the emails, you accused
him of intimidation.

39:07.800 --> 39:09.400
Why didn't you report it?

39:09.479 --> 39:13.239
I did report the fire. I didn't want to
give him the satisfaction before that.

39:13.800 --> 39:14.600
Juno!

39:15.159 --> 39:17.159
She wants to go out.

39:18.319 --> 39:21.600
Is that Gemma's room upstairs?

39:21.680 --> 39:23.680
Not for years.

39:24.360 --> 39:27.479
- Mind if I have a little nose?
- It's just a storeroom, really.

39:55.039 --> 39:58.200
I was looking for something.
I don't know. I was upset.

39:58.280 --> 40:01.360
- Yeah, what were you looking for?
- An old letter my mam wrote us,

40:01.439 --> 40:04.319
saying how she imagined me and
Gemma with our own kids here.

40:04.400 --> 40:05.759
- Did you find it?
- No.

40:05.839 --> 40:08.079
She still has her student
loan stuff sent here.

40:08.159 --> 40:10.920
I usually chuck it on the
desk, but I opened it.

40:21.360 --> 40:23.319
"I'm writing to acknowledge

40:23.400 --> 40:28.560
your change of name to
Mrs Gemma Campbell."

40:30.039 --> 40:33.319
- They were already married?
- Five weeks ago.

40:35.439 --> 40:38.319
And this is why you needed
to see her face to face?

40:38.400 --> 40:40.239
Half of this is his now.

40:40.319 --> 40:44.560
If it burns to the ground for the
insurance, you'll know who to blame.

40:58.039 --> 40:59.720
We've got the DNA on Ryan's boat.

40:59.800 --> 41:02.639
- Gemma's is on there, but
you'd expect it to be. - Right.

41:02.720 --> 41:04.839
No blood, and it hasn't been cleaned.

41:05.759 --> 41:08.720
- Gemma Wyatt. What do
you make of her? - Smart.

41:08.800 --> 41:12.439
A conservationist. Passionate
about protecting animals.

41:12.519 --> 41:15.479
Yeah, yet cruel to her sister, apparently.

41:16.560 --> 41:19.319
Planning her wedding, yet already married.

41:19.400 --> 41:22.839
No-one except Alice has a
bad word to say about her,

41:22.920 --> 41:25.319
but someone wanted her dead.

41:28.319 --> 41:30.319
Right.

41:32.360 --> 41:34.360
Eyes front, everyone.

41:36.519 --> 41:38.479
Now, then, five weeks ago,

41:38.560 --> 41:41.800
Gemma and Ryan suddenly
brought their wedding forward.

41:41.879 --> 41:43.400
Why?

41:43.479 --> 41:45.600
There's one obvious
reason to hurry a wedding.

41:45.680 --> 41:48.959
- No. Tony said she wasn't pregnant.
- I've looked at her search history.

41:49.039 --> 41:51.720
She Googled the window for
taking the morning-after pill.

41:51.800 --> 41:54.119
Did she? When was this?

41:54.200 --> 41:56.639
She searched for it on the 3rd of March.

41:56.720 --> 41:59.039
Do we know where Ryan was then?

41:59.119 --> 42:01.079
Beginning of March...

42:01.159 --> 42:04.280
he posted on Facebook about
having two weeks in Bristol.

42:04.360 --> 42:06.920
Visiting family, by the looks of it.

42:07.000 --> 42:08.800
Right, well, double-check that.

42:08.879 --> 42:12.560
Because if you are right, our
Gemma was cheating on him.

42:12.639 --> 42:15.439
The question is... who with.

42:16.439 --> 42:18.800
There's only these two
fellas on the island.

42:18.879 --> 42:20.879
- Peter and Jamil.
- Mm.

42:24.319 --> 42:28.519
And it's Jamil who's being sent
to the office all the time...

42:30.439 --> 42:32.519
.. and I think we now know why.

42:33.560 --> 42:35.079
I don't think I can add much more

42:35.159 --> 42:37.039
than what I said in my witness statement.

42:37.119 --> 42:39.479
I was working on the north
end of the island all day,

42:39.560 --> 42:40.920
hardly saw anyone.

42:41.000 --> 42:44.759
No, actually we wanted to talk
to you about Gemma's husband Ryan.

42:44.839 --> 42:47.800
- Her fiance.
- No, husband and wife.

42:47.879 --> 42:49.680
Married on the 16th of April.

42:49.759 --> 42:51.759
That can't be right. She would have...

42:51.839 --> 42:53.479
Why not?

42:53.560 --> 42:56.039
Ah, because of your relationship with her?

42:57.560 --> 43:00.600
You were in a relationship
with her, weren't you?

43:00.680 --> 43:04.400
It had been over for about
two months. Her decision.

43:04.479 --> 43:07.119
So were Gemma and Ryan
having problems, then?

43:09.039 --> 43:11.200
Not problems, really.

43:13.479 --> 43:15.319
But there's familiarity, isn't there?

43:15.400 --> 43:18.360
Guess she went with the safe option.

43:19.479 --> 43:20.920
Or she just felt guilty.

43:21.000 --> 43:25.119
And yet there you were, stuck in
each other's pockets on that island.

43:25.200 --> 43:28.959
Is that why Sophia had you
working over here on the mainland?

43:29.959 --> 43:33.319
I didn't think she knew, but
maybe she noticed something.

43:36.319 --> 43:38.879
I saw another side to Gemma
after she broke it off.

43:38.959 --> 43:40.360
How do you mean?

43:40.439 --> 43:42.839
Just stuff I'd said to her.
She threw it back at me.

43:42.920 --> 43:46.920
Once she knew your weaknesses,
she wasn't afraid to go there.

43:58.560 --> 44:01.239
Vicki can vouch for Jamil
through till morning.

44:01.319 --> 44:04.800
If anyone went back for the body
overnight, I'd say it was Ryan.

44:06.959 --> 44:08.959
Are you even listening?

44:09.759 --> 44:13.079
Jamil's the second person to say
Gemma could be a little bit nasty.

44:13.159 --> 44:14.800
They had just broken up.

44:14.879 --> 44:17.000
Yeah, I know. But there's something else.

44:17.079 --> 44:19.959
There's another version
of Gemma we're not seeing.

44:27.879 --> 44:30.239
Have you come to tell me who killed Gemma?

44:30.319 --> 44:32.280
Oh, not yet.

44:32.360 --> 44:35.959
Then can it wait? I'm getting the
boat ready to sell. I'm done.

44:36.039 --> 44:40.239
Well, I'll make this quick,
then. There's no easy way to ask.

44:40.319 --> 44:44.439
Were you aware that
Gemma had had an affair?

44:44.519 --> 44:46.680
With Jamil? Yes, I know.

44:48.800 --> 44:52.039
- When did you find out?
- She told me about it.

44:52.119 --> 44:54.000
And I forgave her. Next question?

44:55.000 --> 44:57.920
You forgave her? What, just like that?

44:58.000 --> 45:00.319
- Never even mentioned it to Jamil?
- It was a fling.

45:00.400 --> 45:02.519
End of the day, she chose
me, and he knew that.

45:02.600 --> 45:04.800
I didn't feel the need
to discuss it with him.

45:04.879 --> 45:08.519
Is that why you got married
earlier? Lay it all to rest?

45:08.600 --> 45:10.600
Why didn't you tell anyone?

45:11.759 --> 45:13.879
We were still gonna do
the big marquee thing.

45:13.959 --> 45:17.000
But, yeah, I just wanted
her to be my wife.

45:17.079 --> 45:21.000
Yeah, but it was your
idea to bring it forward?

45:21.079 --> 45:24.119
- Gemma was happy with it too.
- Happy? What, with no friends?

45:24.200 --> 45:27.720
- No family at all at her wedding?
- It's what we wanted.

45:27.800 --> 45:30.800
Her sister seems to think
that you were controlling --

45:30.879 --> 45:34.720
stirring things, isolating
her from her family.

45:34.800 --> 45:36.720
Alice made that happen all by herself.

45:36.800 --> 45:39.560
And at the end of it all,
you own half the farm.

45:39.639 --> 45:42.119
If you're accusing me,
just come out and say it.

45:42.200 --> 45:43.720
I'm not accusing you.

45:44.800 --> 45:48.039
But I will ask you again,
apart from the texts you sent,

45:48.119 --> 45:51.759
did you have any contact
with your wife on Tuesday?

45:51.839 --> 45:53.839
No.

45:54.119 --> 45:56.759
If your wife turns up dead, and
you knew she had an affair,

45:56.839 --> 45:58.560
you'd tell the police, wouldn't you?

45:58.639 --> 46:01.519
- No matter how proud you are.
- You would think so, wouldn't you?

46:01.600 --> 46:04.639
- Ma'am. - Hicham, see
if you can track down

46:04.720 --> 46:07.680
ex-girlfriends of Ryan
Campbell and Jamil Carter.

46:07.759 --> 46:11.159
Find out if either of them had
ever been violent towards them.

46:11.239 --> 46:12.920
Will do, but Peter Haden...

46:13.000 --> 46:16.200
I think I know why we
couldn't find anything on him.

46:16.280 --> 46:18.000
- Why?
- His real name's Tom Jervis.

46:18.079 --> 46:19.560
And he's done time.

46:19.639 --> 46:23.159
- What's he done time for?
- Serious history of violence.

46:23.239 --> 46:25.159
He was in for bottling
a lad outside a club.

46:25.239 --> 46:27.039
I tracked down Tom's probation officer

46:27.119 --> 46:29.519
and he said Gemma left him
a voicemail on Tuesday,

46:29.600 --> 46:32.879
- wanting to discuss a serious issue about Tom.
- Do we know what about?

46:32.959 --> 46:35.720
Her voicemail didn't say,
but she sounded upset.

46:37.519 --> 46:40.439
Fancy another boat trip? Have
a little chat with Peter?

46:40.519 --> 46:44.759
Or Tom, or whatever it
is he's calling himself.

47:03.039 --> 47:08.959
Peter Haden, AKA Tom Jervis, is he around?

47:09.039 --> 47:11.959
I assume you do know he's Tom Jervis.

47:12.959 --> 47:15.159
He's surveying the tern nests over there.

47:15.239 --> 47:17.000
Right. You go.

47:17.079 --> 47:19.680
I've got a few questions
for Dr Ashbrook here.

47:21.639 --> 47:24.200
- I know I should have said something.
- Yes, you should.

47:24.280 --> 47:27.479
He's been here five months, and
he hasn't put a foot wrong.

47:27.560 --> 47:31.959
So you thought you'd control the flow
of information in a murder inquiry.

47:32.039 --> 47:33.959
I didn't want him to be judged unfairly.

47:34.039 --> 47:36.439
He was involved with some
bad people in Newcastle.

47:36.519 --> 47:38.519
He's trying to distance himself.

47:41.519 --> 47:43.519
Anyone else know about this?

47:44.519 --> 47:46.920
Just me and Gemma. She was mentoring him.

47:47.920 --> 47:49.920
Any problems between them?

47:51.079 --> 47:52.479
They got on well.

47:52.560 --> 47:56.360
Only she left a message for his
probation officer the day she died,

47:56.439 --> 47:58.879
saying there was some
sort of issue with Tom.

47:58.959 --> 48:01.720
- Do you know anything about that?
- Not at all.

48:01.800 --> 48:05.319
Gemma should've spoken to me
before doing anything like that.

48:11.159 --> 48:12.959
And the judge said what?

48:13.039 --> 48:16.360
They said it was joint enterprise,
but the whole trial was a joke.

48:16.439 --> 48:19.519
I wasn't even close enough to
touch the guy when it kicked off.

48:19.600 --> 48:21.839
But the judge didn't like my face, so...

48:21.920 --> 48:26.200
And you've got no idea why Gemma would've
been calling your probation officer?

48:26.280 --> 48:28.600
If I knew, I'd tell you. But I don't.

48:29.560 --> 48:31.360
Can you remember what you were doing

48:31.439 --> 48:33.560
between four and five o'clock on Tuesday?

48:33.639 --> 48:37.159
I was on my own, doing this. I
do it the same time every day.

48:37.239 --> 48:40.800
- What time is it now?
- About half past four.

48:40.879 --> 48:42.879
There you gan.

48:44.400 --> 48:47.600
- What about the evening?
- Pub for Sophia's thing.

48:47.680 --> 48:50.920
I left at 8:30, stayed in one
of the bedrooms upstairs.

48:51.000 --> 48:54.879
You're the first 19-year-old I've
met who leaves a pub at 8:30.

48:54.959 --> 48:56.959
It was my probation officer's idea --

48:57.039 --> 49:00.479
always leave by nine o'clock or
two pints, whichever comes first.

49:00.560 --> 49:04.519
I thought I was doing the right
thing. I won't bother next time.

49:13.560 --> 49:17.439
That sculpture... Did
Caroline Andersen make it?

49:18.639 --> 49:22.239
- So you've met the Andersens.
- Yeah, I spoke to them this morning.

49:23.759 --> 49:27.000
So you were with Gemma
and Davy when it happened?

49:27.079 --> 49:29.360
For all the good it did.

49:29.439 --> 49:31.239
I should've checked his line,

49:31.319 --> 49:34.519
but he was the most experienced
climber out of all of us.

49:36.280 --> 49:38.280
What went wrong?

49:39.759 --> 49:42.879
We'd spotted a Brunnich's
Guillemot down there --

49:42.959 --> 49:45.200
incredibly rare, so he was rushing.

49:47.239 --> 49:50.600
I saw him go over, and then
the line just unravelled.

49:56.239 --> 50:00.879
Do you think there's a connection between
Davy's accident and Gemma's death?

50:00.959 --> 50:03.400
Gemma's was a random attack, surely?

50:07.079 --> 50:11.479
Have you ever felt threatened
by Gareth or Caroline Andersen?

50:13.200 --> 50:14.920
Not threatened, no. But...

50:16.360 --> 50:18.519
At the inquest, Gemma and I stood up there

50:18.600 --> 50:20.959
and said Davy's death was
caused by his own error.

50:21.039 --> 50:23.600
That can't be an easy thing to hear.

50:36.400 --> 50:40.000
Oh, beautiful, isn't it?

50:42.800 --> 50:46.360
My dad brought me here every
summer when I was little.

50:46.439 --> 50:48.400
Oh, I hated it.

50:48.479 --> 50:51.479
He was only here to steal the birds' eggs.

50:56.119 --> 50:58.519
It was my life for almost 30 years.

51:00.039 --> 51:02.639
But you have to know
when it's the right time.

51:02.720 --> 51:05.159
So apart from yourself,

51:05.239 --> 51:08.959
Gemma was the longest serving
Ranger, is that right?

51:09.039 --> 51:10.879
She came to us straight from university.

51:10.959 --> 51:14.400
Yeah, you'd have thought she'd want
to be at your retirement party.

51:14.479 --> 51:18.000
Someone had to stay. She
drew the short straw.

51:19.159 --> 51:21.159
You told me she volunteered.

51:24.239 --> 51:26.239
It's a turn of phrase.

51:30.119 --> 51:33.360
I've got a whole team of
officers down at the station

51:33.439 --> 51:36.560
sifting through every
aspect of that girl's life.

51:38.039 --> 51:42.039
May take time, but things
surface. They always do.

51:43.439 --> 51:46.159
If I knew something that
could help, I'd tell you.

52:03.920 --> 52:05.400
Oh.

52:05.479 --> 52:07.360
What did he have to say for himself?

52:07.439 --> 52:09.600
Very defensive, borderline aggressive.

52:09.680 --> 52:13.439
Claims there was no reason for Gemma
to call his probation officer.

52:13.519 --> 52:18.159
She went over Sophia's head to
make that call. She had a reason.

52:49.000 --> 52:50.839
I need you to come and get me.

53:02.600 --> 53:04.920
- Oh! What kept you?
- Charming!

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
Go on, get them down you.

53:11.519 --> 53:14.079
I can't get past that Nest Cam.

53:14.159 --> 53:16.879
I mean the camera's pointed
at the jetty all night.

53:16.959 --> 53:18.920
There should be something on it.

53:19.000 --> 53:22.920
Kenny's been through it. Ryan's
boat leaves at five, then nothing.

53:24.280 --> 53:26.720
The killer must have found
a way to avoid the camera.

53:26.800 --> 53:28.800
Mm.

53:35.200 --> 53:37.319
Come on, I paid good money for these.

53:43.119 --> 53:44.720
In the church.

53:46.239 --> 53:49.439
I didn't know you were that
way inclined. You know, the...

53:50.239 --> 53:53.039
I'm not... Not any more.

53:55.039 --> 53:57.519
Not after I discovered football and girls.

54:00.239 --> 54:03.159
- No, it's just habit.
- Yeah, you can laugh,

54:03.239 --> 54:05.839
but your bairn will be there soon.

54:07.360 --> 54:09.800
Wish I could be around
a bit more, that's all.

54:09.879 --> 54:13.439
- What are you still doing here, then?
- I didn't mean it like that.

54:13.519 --> 54:16.000
Well, I do. Go on, hop it!

54:16.079 --> 54:18.079
Thanks.

54:19.360 --> 54:21.360
Aiden?

54:22.079 --> 54:24.079
Altar boy, were you?

54:24.879 --> 54:26.879
Eat your chips.

54:58.720 --> 55:00.720
(Dad.)

56:02.479 --> 56:03.959
You been here all night?

56:04.800 --> 56:07.119
Oh, that footage.

56:07.159 --> 56:10.920
I thought perhaps it'd been tampered
with, so I had to look at it myself,

56:10.959 --> 56:14.079
- put my mind at rest.
- And did it?

56:14.119 --> 56:18.079
You see that lot, all going off to
Sophia's party, and then nothing.

56:18.119 --> 56:19.800
Nothing comes, nothing goes.

56:19.839 --> 56:21.959
- All bloody night.
- I don't understand.

56:22.000 --> 56:24.839
Hicham spoke to dozens of
fishermen and the harbour master,

56:24.879 --> 56:26.920
and they all swear
there's no other way on.

56:26.959 --> 56:31.479
Oh, so that's it, case closed.
The body moved all by itself!

56:31.519 --> 56:34.159
What about that dinghy?
Can SOCO give us anything?

56:34.200 --> 56:36.759
- No, there's nothing yet.
- Great.

56:36.800 --> 56:39.039
I didn't get much sleep
either, thanks for asking.

56:39.079 --> 56:40.839
Up all night screaming.

56:40.879 --> 56:44.680
- Who? You or the bairn?
- He gave up about four.

56:44.720 --> 56:46.400
Started going through these.

56:46.439 --> 56:49.200
Sent items from Gemma's work email.

56:49.239 --> 56:51.439
I thought this was a bit strange.

56:51.479 --> 56:55.319
She sent Sophia the same
photo three days in a row.

56:55.360 --> 56:57.639
No message attached until the last one.

56:57.680 --> 56:59.680
"By Friday." What does that mean?

57:01.079 --> 57:03.400
And when did Sophia resign?

57:03.439 --> 57:07.439
See, that's the thing. She sent her
resignation letter that same Friday.

57:08.479 --> 57:12.600
Mark? Find out where Sophia
Ashbrook is working today,

57:12.639 --> 57:14.879
the office or the island.

57:14.920 --> 57:18.239
She didn't strike me as
one for early retirement.

57:18.280 --> 57:20.400
You think Gemma was pushing
her out of the job?

57:20.439 --> 57:23.920
Well, it would explain why she
didn't go to her retirement do.

57:24.720 --> 57:27.519
They both knew something
about Davy's death,

57:27.560 --> 57:29.839
and I think that is Gemma using it.

57:29.879 --> 57:33.439
Sophia and Gemma gave identical
evidence at the inquest.

57:33.479 --> 57:36.560
If Sophia lied, then Gemma lied.

57:36.600 --> 57:39.560
Maybe the Andersens are right.
Maybe there was a cover-up.

57:39.600 --> 57:41.400
Ma'am, they don't know where she is.

57:41.439 --> 57:44.720
She left the island just after you
spoke to her yesterday afternoon.

57:44.759 --> 57:46.479
Michael Hogarth came to get her.

57:46.519 --> 57:50.039
Check if she's got a car on the mainland.

57:50.079 --> 57:52.079
Aiden, with me.

58:05.639 --> 58:08.200
She phoned me at 4:46.

58:08.239 --> 58:11.200
I must have picked her up in the
boat about quarter past five.

58:11.239 --> 58:14.280
- Did she say where she was going? - No.

58:14.319 --> 58:16.400
I just dropped her off at the harbour.

58:16.439 --> 58:18.839
She said she had one
last thing to sort out.

58:19.800 --> 58:22.600
- But she didn't say what?
- I didn't like to ask.

58:22.639 --> 58:25.600
She was a bit wound up. She
lives and breathes that island.

58:25.639 --> 58:28.759
I never thought she'd retire. Never.

58:30.239 --> 58:33.159
We're looking for Sophia, Vicki, love.

58:33.200 --> 58:35.159
She popped in yesterday.

58:35.200 --> 58:38.200
Said she'd be in this morning,
but I haven't seen her.

58:39.239 --> 58:42.039
Can you take us through what
she did when she came in?

58:42.079 --> 58:43.639
Er, she was on the computer.

58:44.680 --> 58:46.680
- Can you...
- I used to know her login.

58:52.360 --> 58:56.400
The night Gemma died, you and
Jamil slept here, is that right?

58:57.720 --> 59:00.039
- Yeah.
- Together?

59:00.079 --> 59:03.079
I don't usually do that
sort of thing, but...

59:03.119 --> 59:05.119
Hm.

59:13.119 --> 59:16.879
- Jamil had had an affair
with Gemma. - Gemma?

59:16.920 --> 59:18.920
Ah, you didn't know that?

59:20.759 --> 59:22.759
Yeah.

59:24.879 --> 59:27.879
Look, I'm-I'm sorry, she must
be using a different password.

59:27.920 --> 59:32.239
Well, I'll lay odds on
this. Try that. Puffin 345.

59:33.400 --> 59:36.200
I'm always forgetting the
bloody things myself.

59:42.560 --> 59:44.319
Go to the last page she looked at.

59:44.360 --> 59:47.879
Accessed at 5:57. It's
an emergency contact form.

59:47.920 --> 59:49.439
Davy Andersen.

59:51.400 --> 59:53.400
She's gone to see his parents.

59:53.439 --> 59:55.439
We need to call the Andersens, warn them.

59:55.479 --> 59:56.879
She's not going to hurt them.

59:56.920 --> 1:00:01.600
If this is to do with Davy's accident and Gemma
was blackmailing her, then that's huge motive.

1:00:01.639 --> 1:00:03.959
Sophia had resigned by
the time Gemma died.

1:00:04.000 --> 1:00:07.479
You don't kill to protect
something you've already given up.

1:00:20.759 --> 1:00:23.119
Sophia's never been to
this house. Why would she?

1:00:23.159 --> 1:00:25.639
Is your husband at home?
Perhaps he's seen her.

1:00:25.680 --> 1:00:29.000
He's always at home. Although,
miraculously, he is at work today.

1:00:29.039 --> 1:00:31.560
Yeah. You've been forced to sell?

1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:34.800
It's all catching up with us now.

1:00:34.839 --> 1:00:37.000
He'll have us living
on that bloody island.

1:00:37.039 --> 1:00:39.680
Is it Gareth who always
wants to go over there?

1:00:41.519 --> 1:00:44.239
He'd stand for days at
that memorial if I let him.

1:00:45.839 --> 1:00:47.600
I had to walk away in the end.

1:00:47.639 --> 1:00:51.839
This was on Tuesday? You
left Gareth on his own?

1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:55.200
Only for 20 minutes. He
was back for the boat.

1:00:55.239 --> 1:00:56.959
And overnight?

1:00:58.800 --> 1:01:02.159
We argued. I got a taxi back here.

1:01:02.200 --> 1:01:05.479
And Gareth stayed in Ambersea alone?

1:01:05.519 --> 1:01:07.400
Sophia's phone's been located.

1:01:07.439 --> 1:01:10.159
She's in Newcastle, north
end of Deneside Road.

1:01:18.800 --> 1:01:20.680
Give it here.

1:01:20.720 --> 1:01:24.600
All right, this way. Quickly!
All officers in attendance.

1:01:24.639 --> 1:01:26.639
Easy now. That's it.

1:01:35.519 --> 1:01:37.519
Mr Andersen?

1:01:38.680 --> 1:01:42.839
- I'm in the middle of a lesson.
- Can't wait, I'm afraid.

1:01:50.439 --> 1:01:53.519
We've got CCTV. You can look
at that if you don't believe me.

1:01:53.560 --> 1:01:57.200
Well, thank you. I'll have a
look at that now, if I can.

1:01:59.319 --> 1:02:02.039
You're wasting your time.
Sophia wouldn't come here.

1:02:02.079 --> 1:02:04.560
She's like Gemma, too
ashamed to show her face.

1:02:04.600 --> 1:02:08.560
And my officers will need a full
set of keys to search the premises.

1:02:08.600 --> 1:02:11.720
- Why are you looking for her, anyway?
- Can't tell you that, pet.

1:02:11.759 --> 1:02:14.119
You expect to search my
business without a warrant

1:02:14.159 --> 1:02:16.319
and you won't even tell
me what this is about?

1:02:16.360 --> 1:02:18.079
Ma'am? We've found something.

1:02:18.119 --> 1:02:20.119
CCTV.

1:02:23.600 --> 1:02:25.600
Found it under the car.

1:02:31.200 --> 1:02:33.759
Dr Sophia Ashbrook.

1:02:43.039 --> 1:02:45.360
Well, something happened
to Sophia Ashbrook

1:02:45.400 --> 1:02:47.839
between yesterday
afternoon and this morning.

1:02:47.879 --> 1:02:50.280
I'm running out of ways
to say I haven't seen her.

1:02:50.319 --> 1:02:53.479
Mm. And her mobile was
found near your premises,

1:02:53.519 --> 1:02:55.959
along with her credit cards and ID.

1:02:56.000 --> 1:02:58.360
Whatever's happened to her
is nothing to do with me.

1:02:58.400 --> 1:03:03.319
Plus we have a statement from a colleague saying
they had to cover your beginners rope course

1:03:03.360 --> 1:03:05.360
when you disappeared last night.

1:03:05.400 --> 1:03:07.400
I needed to clear my head.

1:03:09.600 --> 1:03:11.079
I went for a walk.

1:03:11.119 --> 1:03:13.879
Did you encounter Sophia
Ashbrook during that walk?

1:03:13.920 --> 1:03:15.439
No.

1:03:15.479 --> 1:03:17.319
OK.

1:03:19.039 --> 1:03:23.200
Tell me again about your movements
on Tuesday afternoon and evening.

1:03:23.239 --> 1:03:25.680
I thought I was here to talk about Sophia.

1:03:25.720 --> 1:03:27.839
Ah, well, just answer the question.

1:03:29.079 --> 1:03:32.479
We were on Ternstone all day. Then
we stayed in Ambersea overnight.

1:03:32.519 --> 1:03:34.439
We? So you weren't on your own.

1:03:34.479 --> 1:03:36.400
I've been over this. I was with my wife.

1:03:36.439 --> 1:03:38.560
- The entire time?
- The entire time.

1:03:38.600 --> 1:03:43.400
So why does your wife say you
spent time alone at the memorial

1:03:43.439 --> 1:03:47.159
and she was back home
in Newcastle overnight?

1:03:50.200 --> 1:03:51.879
Mr Andersen?

1:03:53.639 --> 1:03:56.959
So who's lying? You or your missus?

1:03:57.000 --> 1:03:59.439
We had an argument and
she went home without me.

1:03:59.479 --> 1:04:01.680
I didn't think it was
anyone else's business.

1:04:01.720 --> 1:04:05.159
You accused two women of
lying at your son's inquest.

1:04:05.200 --> 1:04:08.280
Now one of them's dead and
the other one's missing.

1:04:08.319 --> 1:04:12.119
- No. - You made frequent trips to
the island where both women work.

1:04:12.159 --> 1:04:15.479
You blame Gemma and Sophia for
your son's death, don't you?

1:04:15.519 --> 1:04:19.839
And you was there looking for
proof. And did you find some proof?

1:04:19.879 --> 1:04:23.600
Is that why Gemma's dead
and Sophia's missing?

1:04:23.639 --> 1:04:28.519
You've no alibi for Tuesday night,
and you've lied about your movements!

1:04:28.560 --> 1:04:30.479
That's how I spent Tuesday night.

1:04:31.800 --> 1:04:33.800
Call that number.

1:04:38.920 --> 1:04:41.639
They're a suicide helpline.

1:04:42.839 --> 1:04:46.920
- Did you leave your name?
- No, but they might remember me.

1:04:46.959 --> 1:04:48.560
I talked about Davy,

1:04:48.600 --> 1:04:51.720
about the first time I took him
climbing when he was a lad.

1:04:54.200 --> 1:04:56.200
He was terrified.

1:04:57.479 --> 1:04:59.479
But I helped him get over it.

1:05:01.479 --> 1:05:03.479
I wish I never had.

1:05:05.959 --> 1:05:07.959
That's why I need proof.

1:05:09.280 --> 1:05:11.560
I have to believe it was their fault.

1:05:11.600 --> 1:05:13.600
Because if they're not to blame...

1:05:28.879 --> 1:05:31.079
Even if we confirm he made the calls,

1:05:31.119 --> 1:05:33.239
does that really give him an alibi?

1:05:33.280 --> 1:05:35.680
Well, it depends on the
location of the phone.

1:05:35.720 --> 1:05:37.639
And the exact timing of the calls.

1:05:37.680 --> 1:05:40.600
Ma'am, they've found Sophia.
She's in the hospital.

1:06:05.400 --> 1:06:07.639
Well, you've been in the wars.

1:06:08.600 --> 1:06:10.280
Something like that.

1:06:10.319 --> 1:06:12.759
Do you mind if I stay for a few minutes?

1:06:15.879 --> 1:06:19.000
You were found near the climbing centre.

1:06:19.039 --> 1:06:21.439
I thought it was time
to stop avoiding 'em.

1:06:23.280 --> 1:06:28.560
I remember feeling dizzy and I must
have fallen and then I woke up here.

1:06:30.039 --> 1:06:33.839
So you were going to tell him
the truth about his son's death?

1:06:34.959 --> 1:06:37.280
We found the emails Gemma sent you.

1:06:38.360 --> 1:06:42.039
It wasn't all a lie. Davy was rushing.

1:06:43.119 --> 1:06:45.119
But it was my mistake.

1:06:45.159 --> 1:06:48.000
I thought I tied it properly.

1:06:48.039 --> 1:06:50.039
I thought I'd checked it.

1:06:53.400 --> 1:06:56.839
My aunty had Parkinson's.
I am sorry, love.

1:06:58.400 --> 1:07:00.400
I didn't realise at the time.

1:07:02.639 --> 1:07:04.720
Did Gemma see you tie the knot?

1:07:04.759 --> 1:07:07.560
She wasn't even there.
She was in the lighthouse.

1:07:09.039 --> 1:07:12.479
- So why say she was there?
- I panicked.

1:07:12.519 --> 1:07:16.360
- I said it was Davy's mistake.
- And she believed you?

1:07:18.920 --> 1:07:21.360
When his parents started asking questions,

1:07:21.400 --> 1:07:23.400
she offered to back me up.

1:07:27.560 --> 1:07:30.560
So when did the blackmail start?

1:07:30.600 --> 1:07:34.000
I passed out in the kitchen
a few weeks ago and she saw.

1:07:34.039 --> 1:07:38.159
- And so you told her everything.
- I thought she'd understand.

1:07:38.200 --> 1:07:42.159
Did you argue with her on
Tuesday? Did it escalate?

1:07:42.200 --> 1:07:45.920
Of course not. I gave her
what she wanted. I resigned.

1:07:45.959 --> 1:07:50.200
Do you think Gemma told Davy's
dad that you'd both lied?

1:07:50.239 --> 1:07:54.319
No. But if you think he's
done something, I need to know.

1:07:54.360 --> 1:07:57.439
He's no threat to you in here, Sophia.

1:07:58.560 --> 1:08:02.720
But I'm gonna have to turn this new
information over to the coroner.

1:08:02.759 --> 1:08:05.439
It doesn't matter now. It's all gone.

1:08:06.439 --> 1:08:08.439
It matters to the Andersens.

1:08:09.839 --> 1:08:11.839
They lost their boy.

1:08:47.920 --> 1:08:50.280
Helen's just checked his phone records.

1:08:50.319 --> 1:08:54.319
He made seven calls to that number
on Tuesday night, all from Ambersea.

1:08:55.159 --> 1:08:58.119
Would he have had time to get
across to the island in between?

1:08:58.159 --> 1:09:00.159
No, it would be incredibly tight.

1:09:01.239 --> 1:09:04.800
Well, I've had to let him go either
way. I've nothing to charge him with.

1:09:04.839 --> 1:09:07.479
Custody sergeant will be
relieved. The cells are rammed.

1:09:07.519 --> 1:09:09.519
He reckons it's a full-moon thing.

1:09:13.600 --> 1:09:15.000
Aiden?

1:09:15.039 --> 1:09:17.400
It was a full moon last night, wasn't it?

1:09:17.439 --> 1:09:19.200
We always get more arrests.

1:09:19.239 --> 1:09:22.920
Well, it's true. They did this study.

1:09:22.959 --> 1:09:25.879
- That's why there's nothing
on that camera. - What?

1:09:25.920 --> 1:09:28.360
That Nest Cam. Get it up on your thingy.

1:09:33.119 --> 1:09:37.439
Now, Tuesday night, we should be
looking at an almost full moon.

1:09:37.479 --> 1:09:39.159
- Right?
- Yeah.

1:09:39.200 --> 1:09:41.560
But what we've got is a crescent.

1:09:41.600 --> 1:09:46.479
Well, the last waxing crescent
was a week ago, at least.

1:09:47.560 --> 1:09:51.759
Someone has switched that footage.
That middle section is not Tuesday.

1:09:51.800 --> 1:09:54.479
It's been replaced by
footage from another night.

1:09:54.519 --> 1:09:57.319
Now get the Geek Squad onto that island.

1:09:57.360 --> 1:09:59.360
I want that missing bit found.

1:10:00.360 --> 1:10:02.280
- And Tom Jervis.
- Tom?

1:10:02.319 --> 1:10:05.400
Yeah, well, he's no alibi,
he's a history of violence,

1:10:05.439 --> 1:10:07.560
and he's the one running that camera.

1:10:12.920 --> 1:10:14.720
Sorry, er, what's this about?

1:10:14.759 --> 1:10:17.639
Oh, just something I need Tom's help with.

1:10:18.759 --> 1:10:20.479
Or Peter, as you'd call him.

1:10:20.519 --> 1:10:22.319
Yeah, I know. He's out there in a kayak.

1:10:22.360 --> 1:10:25.039
- You should've passed him on the way in.
- No. Didn't see him.

1:10:25.079 --> 1:10:27.920
He told us the Zodiac was
the only boat on the island.

1:10:27.959 --> 1:10:30.400
Well, he uses the kayak for cliff counts.

1:10:30.439 --> 1:10:33.239
I'd say he's headed for the mainland.

1:10:49.360 --> 1:10:51.720
Nice day for a paddle.

1:10:51.759 --> 1:10:53.839
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

1:10:53.879 --> 1:10:57.039
Three miles in a kayak?
That's not nothing.

1:10:57.079 --> 1:10:58.720
It's not against the law, either.

1:10:58.759 --> 1:11:01.680
- We need to speak to you down at
the station. - I can't come now.

1:11:01.720 --> 1:11:04.280
About that footage. Fake, wasn't it?

1:11:04.319 --> 1:11:06.720
- This is harassment.
- Yeah, come on, son.

1:11:44.920 --> 1:11:46.920
Cocaine cut with vitamin C powder.

1:11:46.959 --> 1:11:49.920
And in addition to Tom's prints,
we've got a match for Gemma's.

1:11:49.959 --> 1:11:52.600
We now know why she was
calling his probation officer.

1:11:52.639 --> 1:11:54.400
Who does this third set belong to?

1:11:54.439 --> 1:11:57.560
Ah, they belong to this
guy -- Ben Copeland.

1:11:57.600 --> 1:12:02.000
Convictions for GBH, supply, and,
in March, conspiracy to import.

1:12:02.039 --> 1:12:05.000
He seems to be part of a gang
Tom had links to in Newcastle.

1:12:05.039 --> 1:12:08.119
- Right, now that's all
in here, is it? - Yep.

1:12:08.159 --> 1:12:12.200
- Kenny, ETA on that footage?
- It's uploading now.

1:12:12.239 --> 1:12:13.920
Cheers for that.

1:12:13.959 --> 1:12:15.680
You were right, ma'am.

1:12:15.720 --> 1:12:19.000
The tech team are saying that
part of that footage was switched.

1:12:19.039 --> 1:12:20.720
But anyone could have done it.

1:12:20.759 --> 1:12:22.680
There's no pin code, there's no anything.

1:12:22.720 --> 1:12:25.720
Yeah, but what we've got now is
definitely from Tuesday night?

1:12:25.759 --> 1:12:27.400
Oh, the guys are positive.

1:12:27.439 --> 1:12:30.479
Ma'am, Tom Jervis's solicitor's
here. They're ready for us.

1:12:30.519 --> 1:12:33.239
Divide that footage up between
you and make watching it

1:12:33.280 --> 1:12:36.000
- your number-one priority.
- Yes, ma'am.

1:12:36.039 --> 1:12:38.319
What did your missus
think of your heroics?

1:12:38.360 --> 1:12:40.079
Very impressed!

1:12:41.200 --> 1:12:46.000
Three sets of prints, including
yours and this fella's.

1:12:47.560 --> 1:12:49.280
You know him, don't you?

1:12:50.439 --> 1:12:53.560
- No comment.
- Old mate of yours from Newcastle.

1:12:53.600 --> 1:12:56.680
Hobbies include bringing
drugs into the UK.

1:12:56.720 --> 1:12:58.159
No comment.

1:12:58.200 --> 1:13:01.959
Or perhaps you just pull it ashore
and pass it onto the nice tourists.

1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:04.360
- No comment.
- Yes, I know, no comment.

1:13:04.400 --> 1:13:06.720
Well, the Drug Squad will
be talking to you soon.

1:13:06.759 --> 1:13:09.280
You can save your no comments for them.

1:13:09.319 --> 1:13:13.720
Because I'm more interested
in that third set of prints,

1:13:13.759 --> 1:13:16.680
belonging to Gemma Wyatt.

1:13:16.720 --> 1:13:18.439
I never touched Gemma.

1:13:18.479 --> 1:13:20.319
Gemma found that package, didn't she?

1:13:20.360 --> 1:13:24.680
And you knew, if she told the police,
you'd be straight back inside.

1:13:24.720 --> 1:13:26.479
I wasn't anywhere near her.

1:13:26.519 --> 1:13:29.000
You've no alibi for the
time of her murder.

1:13:29.039 --> 1:13:33.200
You left that party early, and
you were in control of that camera

1:13:33.239 --> 1:13:35.879
that was tampered with
to conceal evidence.

1:13:35.920 --> 1:13:37.639
I never done that.

1:13:37.680 --> 1:13:40.360
Look, I paddle out to the
buoy, I collect the gear

1:13:40.400 --> 1:13:44.039
- and I hold onto it. That's all.
- Yet her prints are here.

1:13:44.079 --> 1:13:46.319
She found it, but she
wasn't gonna say anything.

1:13:46.360 --> 1:13:48.239
She knew how hard I was
trying to get away.

1:13:48.280 --> 1:13:51.159
- From your mates in Newcastle?
- They're not my mates.

1:13:51.200 --> 1:13:54.280
I thought one of them was.
Told him where I was working.

1:13:54.319 --> 1:13:56.839
And he shows up. Believe
me, if I'd had any choice.

1:13:56.879 --> 1:13:58.600
But I've got a little sister.

1:13:58.639 --> 1:14:00.920
Gemma tried to speak to
your probation officer,

1:14:00.959 --> 1:14:02.720
and you were desperate to stop her.

1:14:02.759 --> 1:14:04.280
I didn't know she'd done that.

1:14:04.319 --> 1:14:06.680
She promised she wouldn't,
if I never did it again.

1:14:06.720 --> 1:14:09.319
- I said I'd get rid of it.
- Ah, but yet here it is.

1:14:09.360 --> 1:14:13.079
That's 50 grand. You know what
they'd do to us if I threw it away?

1:14:13.119 --> 1:14:14.920
That's why I left the pub on Tuesday,

1:14:14.959 --> 1:14:16.920
try and give it to Ben myself.

1:14:16.959 --> 1:14:18.959
So what happened?

1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:21.439
There was police at the
train station at Newcastle,

1:14:21.479 --> 1:14:24.479
and you lot were all over the
island, so I was trying again today.

1:14:24.519 --> 1:14:27.360
You had to do two things
to keep out of jail --

1:14:27.400 --> 1:14:30.200
get rid of that package and silence Gemma.

1:14:30.239 --> 1:14:32.839
Please! I couldn't kill anyone.

1:14:32.879 --> 1:14:36.280
I know people who could. That's
why I was trying to get away.

1:14:38.800 --> 1:14:40.800
I thought I had a chance.

1:14:43.879 --> 1:14:46.839
It's a sob story. He's
angry, he's violent.

1:14:46.879 --> 1:14:49.839
No, he's a stupid 19-year-old
who's just ruined his life.

1:14:49.879 --> 1:14:51.560
- You're not ruling him out?
- No.

1:14:51.600 --> 1:14:54.239
But I bet the cameras at
Newcastle Train Station will.

1:14:54.280 --> 1:14:56.680
- Ma'am?
- Get Hicham onto it. What?

1:14:56.720 --> 1:14:58.720
We've got 'em.

1:15:01.079 --> 1:15:04.560
- At 2:46am.
- Bull's-eye.

1:15:04.600 --> 1:15:06.639
And again at 3:37am.

1:15:06.680 --> 1:15:10.000
They're on their way back out,
towing the Rangers' dinghy.

1:15:12.720 --> 1:15:14.400
Can you enhance this?

1:15:14.439 --> 1:15:16.319
It's no good, you can't make them out.

1:15:16.360 --> 1:15:18.920
No, that here. The registration number.

1:15:18.959 --> 1:15:20.879
BK3?

1:15:20.920 --> 1:15:24.759
BK372. Ex-fishing boat.

1:15:24.800 --> 1:15:26.800
Yeah, who's it registered to?

1:15:30.560 --> 1:15:32.759
Michael Hogarth.

1:15:40.759 --> 1:15:44.600
Michael's boat doesn't necessarily
equal Michael, though, does it?

1:15:44.639 --> 1:15:47.879
No, but there were no lights on the boat.

1:15:47.920 --> 1:15:51.360
Whoever was at the helm
knew what they were doing.

1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:52.759
Are you thinking Ryan?

1:15:52.800 --> 1:15:56.200
Oh, I honestly don't know. But if it
was Michael, we're missing something.

1:15:56.239 --> 1:16:00.119
He didn't kill that lass because
she told him off about his drinking.

1:16:01.400 --> 1:16:03.560
- Oh, tell 'em to wrap it up.
- Lads!

1:16:04.560 --> 1:16:07.079
And put out an ANPR trace on all vehicles

1:16:07.119 --> 1:16:10.200
owned by Michael Hogarth
and Ryan Campbell.

1:16:14.680 --> 1:16:17.360
Does Michael's house have a garage?

1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:30.000
I'm warning you, Ryan.

1:16:31.159 --> 1:16:32.839
I'm not here to upset you.

1:16:32.879 --> 1:16:35.360
I've got some of Gemma's stuff
from when you were kids.

1:16:35.400 --> 1:16:38.720
Leave me alone, or I'll
call the police. I swear.

1:16:39.879 --> 1:16:42.119
What is your problem with me?

1:16:42.159 --> 1:16:45.079
She was all I had. And you took her away.

1:17:27.800 --> 1:17:30.239
BK372.

1:17:30.280 --> 1:17:32.039
- Can you smell that?
- Bleach.

1:17:32.079 --> 1:17:34.079
That's been cleaned.

1:17:37.879 --> 1:17:39.879
Beth.

1:17:42.479 --> 1:17:44.479
- Everything OK?
- That is your dad's boat?

1:17:44.519 --> 1:17:46.039
Yeah. Why?

1:17:46.079 --> 1:17:48.959
We just have a few more questions
for him, love. In here, is he?

1:17:49.000 --> 1:17:51.200
I think he's gone to bed. Dad?

1:17:57.239 --> 1:17:59.239
Mr Hogarth?

1:18:27.479 --> 1:18:29.479
Aiden!

1:18:34.280 --> 1:18:37.000
- What is it? What's wrong?
- There, love.

1:18:37.039 --> 1:18:39.759
- We really do need to find him.
- Oh, God.

1:18:39.800 --> 1:18:42.239
Can you try him on your mobile for us?

1:18:42.280 --> 1:18:44.280
And check ANPR again.

1:18:45.479 --> 1:18:47.800
- 'Michael Hogarth...'
- Dad, it's me.

1:18:47.839 --> 1:18:50.639
Can you call me, please? I'm worried.

1:18:50.439 --> 1:18:52.600
- We will find him.
- Ma'am.

1:18:52.639 --> 1:18:55.519
We've got a sighting of his
vehicle near Wyatt Farm.

1:18:55.560 --> 1:18:58.639
- Wyatt Farm? - You wait here,
love, in case he comes back.

1:19:05.759 --> 1:19:07.720
Dad?

1:19:16.439 --> 1:19:18.479
- DCI Stanhope.
- 'It's Alice Wyatt.'

1:19:18.519 --> 1:19:22.720
It's Ryan. He came to the door
earlier, and he's outside again.

1:19:22.759 --> 1:19:25.839
'Now stay calm, love.
Are you sure it's him?'

1:19:25.879 --> 1:19:28.200
He's not gonna stop until I agree to sell.

1:19:31.600 --> 1:19:33.519
'Alice?'

1:19:33.560 --> 1:19:34.759
Alice, are you there?

1:19:36.839 --> 1:19:40.800
DS Healy. I need an armed
response to Wyatt Farm immediately.

1:20:02.600 --> 1:20:05.400
Alice, you need to let me make that safe.

1:20:17.720 --> 1:20:19.600
- Ma'am.
- We're looking for an intruder.

1:20:19.639 --> 1:20:21.319
Search the whole area.

1:20:21.360 --> 1:20:23.360
Let's get inside.

1:20:24.879 --> 1:20:26.800
There were headlights near the field.

1:20:26.839 --> 1:20:29.079
Then I thought I saw a
fire behind the trees.

1:20:29.119 --> 1:20:30.639
Did you actually see Ryan?

1:20:30.680 --> 1:20:32.479
No, but it was definitely him earlier.

1:20:32.519 --> 1:20:34.280
He left that on the doorstep.

1:20:34.319 --> 1:20:36.119
Whatever it was, it seems to have gone.

1:20:36.159 --> 1:20:37.800
He's trying to freak me out.

1:20:37.839 --> 1:20:40.959
He comes onto my property at
night, he lets my sheep on the road.

1:20:41.000 --> 1:20:42.800
And I'm not supposed to do anything?

1:20:42.839 --> 1:20:46.560
You and Gemma were at
school with Beth Hogarth?

1:20:46.600 --> 1:20:49.720
Beth and Gemma were in the same year. Why?

1:20:49.759 --> 1:20:52.639
Was she cruel? Did she bully her?

1:20:52.680 --> 1:20:56.400
They used to be friends. Then they
fell out about something and...

1:20:58.639 --> 1:21:01.519
Did Beth's dad know that
Gemma was bullying her?

1:21:01.560 --> 1:21:03.000
I've no idea.

1:21:03.039 --> 1:21:05.439
- There! Look. I told you.
- In the lower field.

1:21:05.479 --> 1:21:07.479
Now, you stay here, love.

1:21:44.360 --> 1:21:47.200
Sorry. I think I frightened her.

1:21:48.560 --> 1:21:50.000
I'm not trying to upset anyone.

1:21:50.039 --> 1:21:54.800
I just like to sit here,
remember my little girl.

1:21:57.000 --> 1:21:59.000
Beth.

1:22:00.200 --> 1:22:02.319
It was anorexia, wasn't it?

1:22:03.400 --> 1:22:07.680
She was 14. This is the last place
I remember seeing her happy.

1:22:08.879 --> 1:22:11.600
Right, well, how many
of these have you taken?

1:22:11.639 --> 1:22:15.159
I came to collect her one Sunday,
messing about in that old truck.

1:22:15.200 --> 1:22:17.280
Pretending to drive it.

1:22:17.319 --> 1:22:19.319
- Michael, how many?
- None.

1:22:20.519 --> 1:22:22.200
- Not yet.
- Call an ambulance.

1:22:22.239 --> 1:22:26.519
Michael, I need you to stay conscious
and I need you talking to me.

1:22:27.800 --> 1:22:30.959
You blame Gemma for what happened
to your daughter, don't you?

1:22:31.000 --> 1:22:32.639
Because she bullied her.

1:22:32.680 --> 1:22:35.959
After their mother left, I was
raising two girls on my own.

1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:38.560
Beth was so beautiful, but...

1:22:40.319 --> 1:22:43.000
.. Gemma did something to my little girl.

1:22:44.519 --> 1:22:46.519
And I couldn't undo it.

1:22:47.839 --> 1:22:50.280
Why'd you wait over a decade?

1:22:50.319 --> 1:22:52.000
I found her diary.

1:22:53.159 --> 1:22:57.479
So you got her alone on that
island, and you drowned her?

1:22:57.519 --> 1:23:00.839
How'd she get that injury on her head?

1:23:00.879 --> 1:23:02.639
I dropped her getting into the boat.

1:23:02.680 --> 1:23:04.519
Dad!

1:23:04.560 --> 1:23:06.560
I told you not to come.

1:23:06.600 --> 1:23:08.879
You leave me a note like
that, of course I'll come!

1:23:08.920 --> 1:23:11.239
Victoria. It's fine.

1:23:16.759 --> 1:23:19.200
- We need to get him inside.
- All right, come on.

1:23:19.239 --> 1:23:20.800
- Come on.
- One, two, three.

1:23:20.839 --> 1:23:23.119
Come on, Michael. Nice and steady.

1:23:35.000 --> 1:23:38.560
I need you to take me through
what happened from the beginning.

1:23:40.720 --> 1:23:42.720
I knew where to find Gemma.

1:23:43.680 --> 1:23:46.519
She was up on the cliffs near the pond.

1:23:46.560 --> 1:23:49.200
I made sure there was no-one else around.

1:23:49.239 --> 1:23:51.920
Do we really have to put
him through this right now?

1:23:51.959 --> 1:23:53.800
Look, I know it's difficult.

1:23:53.839 --> 1:23:57.800
I remember what you said
to me in the church --

1:23:57.839 --> 1:24:00.839
when you lose a child, it's
hard to come back from that.

1:24:02.239 --> 1:24:07.200
And I expect it's the same when
you lose a sister. Isn't it?

1:24:07.239 --> 1:24:10.680
Is that why your dad's lying to me?

1:24:10.720 --> 1:24:11.879
No, I...

1:24:11.920 --> 1:24:16.200
You told me you dropped Gemma when
you were putting her in the boat,

1:24:16.239 --> 1:24:20.159
but we know she got her
head injury before she died.

1:24:21.600 --> 1:24:26.000
And I think you can tell us what
happened there, can't you, love?

1:24:26.039 --> 1:24:30.720
She was with Jamil Carter all
night. She didn't do anything.

1:24:30.759 --> 1:24:33.600
Dad... they obviously know.

1:24:33.639 --> 1:24:36.519
Please, Vicki. It's not what we agreed.

1:24:38.159 --> 1:24:40.200
It was my fault from the beginning.

1:24:41.280 --> 1:24:45.720
I should've told someone about the
bullying, but Beth made me promise.

1:24:47.959 --> 1:24:50.119
- I'm sorry.
- You were 12.

1:24:51.319 --> 1:24:55.600
And you felt this triggered her
illness, hm? Is that right?

1:24:55.639 --> 1:24:59.959
Beth didn't "develop" an eating
disorder. Gemma gave it to her.

1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:05.000
She destroyed Beth. She
literally reduced her to nothing.

1:25:06.360 --> 1:25:09.360
So you got that job on
the island to get revenge?

1:25:09.400 --> 1:25:12.879
But I needed her to understand
that she caused it all.

1:25:14.239 --> 1:25:17.800
She's the reason I left
school with no GCSEs.

1:25:18.920 --> 1:25:22.400
She's the reason he's
drinking himself to death.

1:25:22.439 --> 1:25:25.600
And after Gemma finished her Ranger talk,

1:25:25.639 --> 1:25:27.560
you followed her and you attacked her.

1:25:27.600 --> 1:25:30.319
No! I wanted to have it
out with her, that's all.

1:25:31.400 --> 1:25:33.879
But she laughed in me face.

1:25:33.920 --> 1:25:36.360
Actually laughed.

1:25:36.400 --> 1:25:41.319
She said it wasn't her fault
if some people are messed up.

1:25:43.400 --> 1:25:46.000
I don't really know
what happened after that.

1:25:46.800 --> 1:25:50.920
You might not have planned it,
but you knew what you were doing.

1:25:52.119 --> 1:25:56.720
You held her head under the water
until she stopped struggling,

1:25:56.759 --> 1:26:00.239
and then you dragged her
to the observation hut.

1:26:00.280 --> 1:26:02.439
I had to do something.

1:26:02.479 --> 1:26:05.119
Davy's parents were up there somewhere.

1:26:05.159 --> 1:26:07.560
They would have seen
the body straight away.

1:26:07.600 --> 1:26:09.959
You needed her sitting in that hut

1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:15.319
because you knew Ryan would be able
to see her there from his boat.

1:26:15.360 --> 1:26:18.280
You wanted everyone to
think she was still alive.

1:26:18.319 --> 1:26:20.079
I didn't know what else to do.

1:26:20.119 --> 1:26:24.319
Then you went to the pub and
made sure everybody saw you.

1:26:24.360 --> 1:26:27.319
Even went as far as sleeping with Jamil,

1:26:27.360 --> 1:26:30.280
so your entire time was accounted for.

1:26:31.839 --> 1:26:37.759
And meanwhile, there's Dad
turning himself into an accessory.

1:26:37.800 --> 1:26:39.680
She didn't ask me to do it.

1:26:39.720 --> 1:26:42.159
I found her in the garage, crying.

1:26:44.439 --> 1:26:46.439
I've failed my girls all my life.

1:26:46.479 --> 1:26:50.239
I... I just wanted to make things right.

1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:54.000
You didn't fail us.

1:26:57.920 --> 1:27:01.560
Victoria Hogarth, I am arresting
you for the murder of Gemma Wyatt.

1:27:01.600 --> 1:27:04.400
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence

1:27:04.439 --> 1:27:06.360
if you do not mention, when questioned,

1:27:06.400 --> 1:27:08.200
something you later rely on in court.

1:27:08.239 --> 1:27:12.319
Anything you say may be given
in evidence. Do you understand?

1:27:12.360 --> 1:27:16.239
Michael Hogarth, I'm arresting you
for being an accessory to murder.

1:27:16.280 --> 1:27:20.119
You don't have to say anything, but it may
harm your defence if you do not mention...

1:27:40.800 --> 1:27:43.119
Well, we can leave them to clear up.

1:27:43.159 --> 1:27:45.439
You can have what's left of the weekend.

1:27:48.200 --> 1:27:50.959
- You all right?
- Yeah. Yeah, sorry.

1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:54.079
I keep thinking about
this mate I had at school.

1:27:54.119 --> 1:27:56.680
He was really clever, into computers.

1:27:56.720 --> 1:28:00.000
But... all the lads used
to give him a hard time.

1:28:00.039 --> 1:28:01.759
I tried to stick up for him.

1:28:01.800 --> 1:28:05.000
Well, sometimes it's easier
to keep your head down.

1:28:05.039 --> 1:28:08.439
Mind you, last I heard he moved to
America, runs his own tech company.

1:28:08.479 --> 1:28:10.200
One of the lucky ones, then.

1:28:10.239 --> 1:28:12.959
Bet he still remembers
that bullying, though.

1:28:15.839 --> 1:28:18.159
Oh, Aiden! Come here.

1:28:23.920 --> 1:28:25.920
Something for you in there. Go on.

1:28:28.560 --> 1:28:31.400
- Pasta bake? - Not as good
as your cheesy pasta, mind,

1:28:31.439 --> 1:28:34.280
- but...
- Cheers.

1:28:35.439 --> 1:28:37.439
Well, off you go, then.
