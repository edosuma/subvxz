WEBVTT

00:05.440 --> 00:06.668
- Hey, Donna.
- Oh, hey.

00:06.840 --> 00:07.829
You look stressed.

00:08.000 --> 00:08.989
Work is a disaster.

00:12.240 --> 00:13.753
- Hey.
- Hi.

00:13.920 --> 00:17.196
- What's wrong?
- Well, I'm swamped, thanks to you.

00:18.720 --> 00:19.948
I'll get you some coffee, okay?

00:20.120 --> 00:22.395
Oh, thanks, to go please.

00:22.560 --> 00:24.630
Well,
Camille's been completely worthless

00:24.800 --> 00:26.074
ever since you broke up with her.

00:26.240 --> 00:28.037
So I just told her
to take the week off.

00:28.200 --> 00:29.553
She was scaring away
the customers.

00:29.720 --> 00:30.709
Yeah, she'll get over it.

00:30.880 --> 00:31.869
Mitch, on the other hand,

00:32.040 --> 00:34.031
holds me responsible
for the way you burned him.

00:34.240 --> 00:35.275
That's ridiculous.

00:35.440 --> 00:37.829
Maybe, but you remember the
Macy Gray tickets he promised me?

00:38.000 --> 00:39.035
[WHlSTLES]

00:39.200 --> 00:41.350
- Gone.
- There you go.

00:41.520 --> 00:42.839
- Thanks.
- You all right?

00:43.000 --> 00:44.911
Oh, yeah.

00:45.600 --> 00:48.478
- Weren't they third row centre?
- Backstage passes.

00:48.640 --> 00:50.676
Yeah, and I thought you cared.

00:50.840 --> 00:53.752
Ha, ha. Yeah, imagine that,
me not putting your needs first.

00:54.280 --> 00:55.713
I know, I was a little disappointed.

00:55.880 --> 00:58.110
I'll make it up to you.
How about dinner and a movie?

00:58.960 --> 01:01.520
- Who gets to pick the movie?
- Do I get to pick the restaurant?

01:01.720 --> 01:03.676
- No Thai.
- No subtitles.

01:05.040 --> 01:07.315
- You're a pain, you know that?
- I know.

01:13.200 --> 01:15.316
MATT:
All I'm saying is that it could be fun.

01:15.480 --> 01:17.357
KELLY:
I like Seattle, but living there?

01:17.520 --> 01:19.112
People have been known to enjoy it.

01:19.280 --> 01:20.918
Mm. I just never considered it.

01:21.080 --> 01:23.275
But if the job
that you're being offered is great--

01:23.440 --> 01:26.557
Might be offered, might be offered.
Nothing definite.

01:28.280 --> 01:31.238
You said that someone from law school
recommended you for it.

01:31.400 --> 01:32.799
Jack, yup. Great guy.

01:32.960 --> 01:34.996
Hmm. And did out of the blue,
no prompting?

01:35.160 --> 01:36.149
Yeah.

01:36.320 --> 01:38.436
- Because if you had called him...
- Which I didn't.

01:38.600 --> 01:39.589
I'd be a little annoyed

01:39.760 --> 01:41.830
because big decisions like this
we should talk about.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.151
You know, when you get righteous
like this, it's a big, big turn on. It is.

01:48.480 --> 01:50.232
- Hey.
- Excuse me.

01:50.400 --> 01:52.550
Um, Dylan, wait a second.
We want to talk to you.

01:52.720 --> 01:54.199
About what?

01:54.360 --> 01:57.193
- Uh, we've set a date for our wedding.
- Glad to hear it.

01:57.360 --> 02:00.397
August 1 2th, telling everyone now
so you can set aside the day.

02:00.600 --> 02:03.034
Yeah, well, I have a dentist
appointment that afternoon.

02:03.640 --> 02:05.392
Dylan, I want you to be there.

02:05.560 --> 02:06.959
We both do.

02:07.160 --> 02:08.592
I'll see what I can do.

02:15.160 --> 02:17.310
Well, he was enthusiastic.

02:17.480 --> 02:19.038
Forget him.
Let's go tell everyone else.

02:19.200 --> 02:20.553
Okay.

03:54.600 --> 03:57.592
You know, I really like that story about
the rabbit who rose from the dead.

03:57.760 --> 03:59.796
That was true, every bit of it true.

03:59.960 --> 04:02.679
But my personal favourite's got to be
the leprechaun of Beverly Hills.

04:02.840 --> 04:06.116
Oh, meet the author
of that tall tale, Janet Sosna.

04:06.280 --> 04:07.872
- Nice to meet you.
- I'm Charles Yoffee.

04:08.040 --> 04:09.029
I'm a big fan.

04:09.200 --> 04:11.589
You don't write down to your material.
That's not easy to do.

04:11.760 --> 04:13.398
Oh, I'll say.

04:13.560 --> 04:15.630
You wanted to talk to us.
Why don't we sit down?

04:15.800 --> 04:17.233
Great.

04:18.240 --> 04:19.673
You know, I'll just get right to it.

04:19.839 --> 04:21.319
- Okay.
CHARLES: Ahem.

04:22.440 --> 04:23.714
I wanna buy the Beat.

04:23.880 --> 04:24.869
[LAUGHS]

04:25.040 --> 04:26.075
It's not for sale.

04:26.280 --> 04:28.840
Neither were my other six papers
before I bought them.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.356
Here, I've written down a figure
that I think you'll find is more than fair.

04:39.720 --> 04:41.756
- Why The Beat?
- I'm from New York.

04:41.920 --> 04:44.639
All my holdings are back there.
I need a foothold in Los Angeles.

04:44.840 --> 04:47.035
If you're in New York,
who's gonna run the paper here?

04:47.240 --> 04:49.231
Typically,
I consolidate at the management level

04:49.400 --> 04:50.628
but leave editorial alone.

04:51.560 --> 04:54.950
- That means--?
- That means you go but she stays.

04:55.160 --> 04:56.639
For a year or there's no deal.

04:57.800 --> 04:59.028
Look, it's nothing personal.

04:59.200 --> 05:00.952
I just don't need two publishers
on the paper.

05:01.120 --> 05:02.917
But I do need editorial continuity.

05:04.280 --> 05:05.759
I don't know.

05:06.520 --> 05:09.080
I understand. It's a big decision.

05:09.280 --> 05:11.111
Look, think it over.

05:11.720 --> 05:12.869
I'll be in touch.

05:17.360 --> 05:18.349
[SlGHS]

05:18.520 --> 05:23.719
Janet, uh, are there as many zeroes
there as I think there are?

05:23.880 --> 05:26.713
Mm-hm. Breathe.

05:28.520 --> 05:31.717
No, all I'm saying is that when I saw
you and David this morning together,

05:31.880 --> 05:32.869
you looked happy.

05:33.040 --> 05:34.758
No, you said
we looked happy together.

05:34.920 --> 05:36.558
It wasn't an accusation.

05:36.720 --> 05:39.154
I know you think
I should tell David how I feel but...

05:39.320 --> 05:40.309
[SlGHS]

05:40.480 --> 05:42.755
You didn't wanna be the reason
he broke up with Camille.

05:42.960 --> 05:45.952
I understood that. But now he's free,
I don't see why you wouldn't.

05:46.120 --> 05:50.432
Oh. Here, l, uh, think any of these
bridesmaid dresses would be perfect.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.192
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yes.

05:52.360 --> 05:54.920
You think I should risk
ruining a very important friendship

05:55.080 --> 05:56.798
on a rebound affair.

05:58.120 --> 05:59.838
Maybe we should
stick to the dresses.

06:00.040 --> 06:04.079
Well, ugh, you look.
I'm gonna get some coffee.

06:05.800 --> 06:07.995
Donna. Hi, sweetie.

06:08.160 --> 06:09.434
Can you sit with me for a minute?

06:09.600 --> 06:12.273
Yeah, um, that skirt you ordered,
it's not in yet.

06:12.440 --> 06:14.158
Oh, I forgot all about it.

06:16.720 --> 06:19.188
I wanted to talk to you
about the house.

06:19.600 --> 06:20.874
I've put it on the market.

06:23.200 --> 06:24.269
You're gonna sell it?

06:26.120 --> 06:29.317
Yeah, it's just too big for me
all by myself.

06:29.520 --> 06:30.953
There's too many memories.

06:31.800 --> 06:32.949
Where would you go?

06:33.720 --> 06:34.869
I don't know, a condo.

06:35.080 --> 06:37.036
- A condo?
- Or an apartment.

06:38.040 --> 06:39.393
Well, you live in an apartment.

06:39.600 --> 06:45.391
I'm sorry, I mean, I know I haven't
lived there in years but it's home.

06:45.600 --> 06:47.591
I know, sweetie.

06:47.760 --> 06:50.558
And that made it
a really hard decision.

06:51.200 --> 06:52.519
But it's what I wanna do.

06:58.080 --> 06:59.911
NOAH:
You wanna talk about it?

07:00.760 --> 07:01.829
What's there to talk about?

07:02.000 --> 07:04.275
We were gonna see Caitlin
and now we're not.

07:04.480 --> 07:07.119
I'm sure your mom
had a good reason for cancelling.

07:07.280 --> 07:08.713
How about she doesn't trust me?

07:09.320 --> 07:11.675
You're in recovery,
you're committed to it.

07:11.840 --> 07:13.034
No way she doesn't see that.

07:13.240 --> 07:14.912
She's seen it before.

07:16.080 --> 07:17.229
Caitlin is your daughter.

07:17.400 --> 07:20.392
Okay, if you want to take care of her,
she won't stand in your way.

07:21.600 --> 07:25.036
- I cannot let her down again.
- You won't.

07:25.240 --> 07:27.196
No, you don't understand. I can't.

07:29.040 --> 07:30.678
Okay, why do you drink?

07:30.880 --> 07:32.518
I don't know.

07:32.720 --> 07:33.948
I say it's out of guilt.

07:34.600 --> 07:37.478
You know, you're guilty
because you're not a better mom.

07:37.680 --> 07:42.674
Just be in Caitlin's life, the guilt
will go away and all the temptation.

07:42.840 --> 07:43.829
Trust me, okay?

07:48.840 --> 07:50.796
[DANCE MUSlC PLAYlNG]

07:53.080 --> 07:54.115
Okay, here are the pluses.

07:54.840 --> 07:57.479
More money. More time with Maddy.

07:58.320 --> 08:01.790
And more time for you to come up
with your next genius venture.

08:03.360 --> 08:05.191
Okay, here are the minuses now.

08:05.360 --> 08:07.954
Less time together.
More work for you.

08:08.120 --> 08:09.712
This whole Mr. Mom thing for me.

08:10.440 --> 08:13.477
I thought that spending more time
with Maddy was on the plus side?

08:13.840 --> 08:14.829
Well, it is.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.992
It's balanced against this image of me
wearing the apron in the family and--

08:18.160 --> 08:20.879
Steve, we wouldn't even
be considering this offer

08:21.040 --> 08:22.268
if it wasn't for you.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.079
The tabloid was your idea.

08:25.240 --> 08:29.074
The cheesiness,
the horrifically invasive profiles.

08:29.240 --> 08:32.073
If it were up to me,
we'd still be doing emotionally honest,

08:32.240 --> 08:34.434
factually correct,
objectively interesting stories.

08:35.200 --> 08:37.350
Thanks. I feel a lot better now.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.231
Because of you
our circulation tripled, okay?

08:42.400 --> 08:44.709
Because of you, we have
a shot at being financially secure.

08:44.880 --> 08:47.269
I'd say you did right by us.

08:47.920 --> 08:49.558
Thanks.

[SlGHS]

08:52.040 --> 08:53.632
So do you wanna sell it?

08:54.880 --> 08:57.474
Well, selling the paper's
gonna take a lot of time.

08:57.640 --> 09:00.029
And while they're drawing up
the contracts and contingencies,

09:00.200 --> 09:01.553
I think we should give it a shot.

09:01.760 --> 09:04.752

the sale's going before it's finalised--

it got me to thinking.

- Ahem. Plane tickets.
- To where?

I don't know, they're open-ended.

10:07.600 --> 10:08.999

Is that what this is?

that she's moving on but...

10:51.200 --> 10:54.476
Donna, I understand that it's hard.

10:55.320 --> 10:57.754
I mean, you know,
it was the house you grew up in.

10:58.360 --> 11:00.828
It sounds so ridiculous

11:03.040 --> 11:05.156
but I just feel
like if she sells the house,

11:05.320 --> 11:07.914
I'm gonna lose part of my childhood.

11:08.120 --> 11:10.475
That's not ridiculous.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.468
I just--
I have all these moments there.

11:15.400 --> 11:20.872
My dad putting a swing up
in the tree in the front yard for me.

11:21.040 --> 11:25.556
My dad turning the attic
into this gigantic playroom.

11:26.200 --> 11:28.794
And the way my mom always
decorated the house for Christmas.

11:29.240 --> 11:34.872
Yeah, I remember your mom's
tree selection was, uh,

11:35.480 --> 11:37.072
never very restrained.

11:37.280 --> 11:38.793
She always said, "The taller the tree,

11:38.960 --> 11:40.791
the closer the angel is
to heaven.' Heh.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.152

ridiculously amazing ornaments.

My favourite was this little
clothespin reindeer that I made.

11:55.320 --> 11:59.916
I just hate the thought of not spending
another Christmas in that house.

we just hang out here tonight, all right?

12:08.440 --> 12:12.353

- Yeah, heh.
- Yeah?

12:14.320 --> 12:16.993
- I would really like that.
- Good, all right.

12:17.160 --> 12:18.275
On two conditions.

12:18.480 --> 12:21.836
Conditions, right. Let me guess.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.833
First one being,

12:25.000 --> 12:27.434
of course,
control of the remote, right?

12:27.600 --> 12:29.397
- Of course. Ha-ha-ha.
- And?

Yeah.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.831
- Did she say she was running late?
- Shh.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.037
- Caitlin's napping.
- Oh, right, sorry.

24:54.400 --> 24:57.517
Did she tell you
when she'd be here?

24:57.680 --> 25:01.116
Uh, yeah, I think I pencilled it in.

25:01.280 --> 25:03.077
Huh, no. I know she'll be here.

25:03.240 --> 25:05.151
Because right now,
she's trying her best.

25:05.400 --> 25:08.153
- I know.
- Then why fight her about Caitlin?

25:08.920 --> 25:11.229

needs consistency.

more credit than that.

- Ha-ha-ha.

37:43.640 --> 37:46.677
She, um, ahem.
She said you'd be perfect for me.

37:46.840 --> 37:50.276
- Get out of here, Felice didn't say that.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, she actually did.

37:51.600 --> 37:54.512
Well, I guess, uh, everybody's
trying to tell us something, huh?

37:54.680 --> 37:56.796
Well, it would seem that way.

38:02.760 --> 38:05.115
You think they understand
just how much we'd be risking?

38:06.000 --> 38:07.831
No, no. How could they?

38:08.000 --> 38:11.879
Because if they understood, they would
know why we just want to stay friends.

38:12.040 --> 38:17.558
And then they'd stop pushing us
to do something we just don't want.

38:17.760 --> 38:21.594
Right,
something that we know is wrong.

38:29.040 --> 38:30.837
We could end up regretting this.

38:31.280 --> 38:32.838
Definitely.

38:55.280 --> 38:57.111
It won't work.

38:57.280 --> 38:59.840
- What?
- Leaving.

39:00.520 --> 39:02.192
Is that why you wanted me
to meet you here?

39:02.360 --> 39:03.839
So you can tell me not to leave.

39:04.040 --> 39:06.429
Yes, that and to see
if you wanted to go bowling.

39:07.760 --> 39:10.479
I haven't decided to go anywhere.

39:11.920 --> 39:14.229
I tried. It doesn't help you forget.

39:16.040 --> 39:18.554
- You can't do this, Dylan.
- Do what?

39:18.720 --> 39:21.075
This, meeting me here.
Now, at the last minute.

39:21.560 --> 39:22.913
Why not?

39:23.120 --> 39:25.998
- Because.
- Because?

39:26.160 --> 39:28.913
- Because you don't want to?
- I don't.

39:29.520 --> 39:31.988
Because it's confusing?

39:33.320 --> 39:34.469
You're leaving because of me?

39:34.680 --> 39:36.398
I didn't say I was leaving.

39:36.600 --> 39:37.828
If you do...

39:39.040 --> 39:41.031
It won't have anything
to do with you.

39:42.200 --> 39:43.758
I'm glad you're clear on that.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.228
Because a couple of months ago

39:46.440 --> 39:48.351
you were saying something
to me about commitment.

39:48.520 --> 39:53.435
Something about me committing
to you and not just a little bit.

39:53.640 --> 39:54.959
All or nothing.

39:55.600 --> 39:57.477
You chose nothing.

39:57.680 --> 39:59.716
Let me choose again.

40:00.600 --> 40:02.272
You can't. It's too late.

40:03.360 --> 40:04.554
No, it's not.

40:04.760 --> 40:07.194
- I have to go.
- No, you don't.

40:10.480 --> 40:11.754
Why is it too late?

40:18.720 --> 40:21.029
Because it is.
