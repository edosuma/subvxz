WEBVTT

00:04.714 --> 00:07.547
(Rygel groaning)

00:07.633 --> 00:09.624
God, I'm going to be sick.

00:09.719 --> 00:11.300
What's with the rough ride?

00:11.387 --> 00:13.343
Moya need a tune-up
or something?

00:13.431 --> 00:17.390
Moya's pregnancy has
drastically weakened her
ability to Starburst.

00:17.476 --> 00:20.309
Some minor turbulence is an
unfortunate by-product.

00:20.396 --> 00:22.307
If this is minor, I don't
want to see major.

00:22.398 --> 00:24.480
It's not just the
Starburst, John.

00:24.567 --> 00:27.149
Moya's sensors are dimmed.
We're practically flying blind.

00:27.236 --> 00:29.318
I'm compensating for that.

00:29.405 --> 00:31.737
All her systems are running
less efficiently as well.

00:31.824 --> 00:36.193
She can't help it.
Her child has first call
on her resources.

00:36.287 --> 00:39.154
Now I understand why the
Peacekeepers tried to prevent
this pregnancy.

00:39.248 --> 00:41.534
We are about to exit Starburst.

00:41.626 --> 00:44.584
There is no reason for concern.

00:44.670 --> 00:46.535
Famous last words.

00:50.927 --> 00:54.294
I guess we can turn off the
"fasten seat belt" sign now.

00:59.393 --> 01:00.803
Pilot! Incoming!

01:00.895 --> 01:02.305
| see it!

01:02.396 --> 01:03.055
Whoa!

01:08.319 --> 01:10.310
Zhaan:
Pilot, any damage to Moya?

01:10.404 --> 01:13.896
None detected, but the other
ship has lost propulsor
control.

01:13.991 --> 01:16.198
l'm deploying the docking web
to bring her aboard.

01:16.285 --> 01:17.365
Is that wise?

01:17.453 --> 01:19.444
Our record with guests isn't
too sweet, Pilot.

01:19.538 --> 01:22.200
Moya and I should have avoided
that collision entirely.

01:22.291 --> 01:24.156
Yeah, but isn't there
some way we can...

01:24.252 --> 01:25.833
No.

01:25.920 --> 01:27.376
l'|| rally the troops.

01:46.023 --> 01:47.433
Stop there.

01:48.901 --> 01:51.187
I am unarmed.

01:51.279 --> 01:52.143
But your ship is not.

01:52.238 --> 01:55.401
We've detected a massive
energy weapon.

01:55.491 --> 01:59.234
Powered right down,
for the moment.

01:59.328 --> 02:03.287
Is that not evidence of our
peaceful intentions?

02:03.374 --> 02:05.330
There are more on your ship.

02:05.418 --> 02:09.627
Two others, also unarmed.

02:09.714 --> 02:15.254
May | inform them that it is
safe for them to emerge?

02:18.389 --> 02:21.301
Aeryn:
All right, go ahead.

02:25.438 --> 02:26.803
Salis.

02:26.897 --> 02:28.728
You mayjoin us now.

02:36.866 --> 02:37.776
You.

02:37.867 --> 02:40.108
You can't be alive.

02:49.420 --> 02:50.876
I saw you dead.

02:50.963 --> 02:54.000
I saw your stinking corpse.

02:55.176 --> 02:56.086
Rygel!

02:56.177 --> 02:57.383
What the hell are you doing?

02:57.470 --> 02:59.131
It's him! It's Durka!

02:59.221 --> 03:01.883
Vicious, murdering bastard.

03:01.974 --> 03:05.933
Captain of the Zelbinion, the
first ship I was imprisoned on.

03:06.020 --> 03:07.430
My torturer!

03:07.521 --> 03:08.852
Aeryn:
Don't be ridiculous, Rygel.

03:08.939 --> 03:11.897
Durka died well over
100 cycles ago.

03:11.984 --> 03:13.144
Crichton:
Rygel...

03:13.235 --> 03:15.146
you're way off base here.

03:15.237 --> 03:19.901
No, he is not "off-base."

03:22.036 --> 03:25.369
lam Durka.

03:29.460 --> 03:31.621
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut...

03:31.712 --> 03:34.795
...a radiation wave hit and I
got shot through a wormhole...

03:34.882 --> 03:37.749
Now I'm lost in some distant
part of the universe on a ship.

03:37.843 --> 03:41.301
A living ship full of strange
alien life-forms...

03:41.389 --> 03:42.174
Help me...

03:42.264 --> 03:43.674
Listen, please.

03:43.766 --> 03:45.757
Is there anybody out there
who can hear me?

03:45.851 --> 03:49.844
...being hunted by an insane
military commander...

03:49.939 --> 03:52.271
...doing everything I can...

03:52.358 --> 03:54.770
I'm just looking for
a way home.

04:14.422 --> 04:16.208
Rygel:
Let me at him!

04:18.008 --> 04:19.464
Crichton:
Damn it!

04:21.429 --> 04:23.260
D'Argo:
You claim to be Captain Durka

04:23.347 --> 04:25.963
from the Peacekeeper Command
Carrier Zelbinion.

04:26.058 --> 04:27.343
l was.

04:27.435 --> 04:28.766
I told you it was him.

04:28.853 --> 04:30.184
Behave!

04:30.271 --> 04:31.886
Aeryn:
How is it possible?

04:31.981 --> 04:33.812
Even if you survived the
Zelbinion,

04:33.899 --> 04:37.016
you would have died of old age
over 50 cycles ago.

04:37.111 --> 04:38.897
He was fortunate.

04:38.988 --> 04:40.979
We saved him.

04:45.327 --> 04:46.783
My people are the Nebari.

04:46.871 --> 04:48.862
You brought this monster
on board.

04:48.956 --> 04:49.615
Rygel.

04:49.707 --> 04:50.992
He poses no danger.

04:51.083 --> 04:52.698
No danger?

04:52.793 --> 04:54.408
He tortured me.

04:54.503 --> 04:56.118
That behavior will not recur.

04:56.213 --> 04:58.545
He is now incapable of evil.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.133
D'Argo:
If this is Durka,

05:00.217 --> 05:03.334
how can we be certain that he
no longer poses any threat?

05:03.429 --> 05:07.513
Because we spent over a hundred
cycles making sure.

05:07.600 --> 05:10.137
Rygel:
A million cycles would not
change him.

05:10.227 --> 05:12.218
He will always be Durka.

05:12.313 --> 05:14.304
Put me down.

05:22.281 --> 05:25.273
Salis:
Your friend will soon
understand that he is wrong.

05:25.367 --> 05:27.653
Crichton:
It might take a while.

05:27.745 --> 05:29.906
Being tortured has that effect.

05:29.997 --> 05:32.238
I suppose you would know.

05:32.333 --> 05:34.540
You are a Sebacean.

05:34.627 --> 05:36.163
No.

05:36.253 --> 05:37.754
I'm a human.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.339
Human?

05:39.423 --> 05:41.960
I'm not familiar with
your species.

05:43.302 --> 05:46.840
We are due to rendezvous with
our host ship in this quadrant.

05:46.931 --> 05:52.892
In the interim, we will require
quarters and sustenance.

05:52.978 --> 05:57.972
Durka:
Does this ship possess any kind
of containment cells?

05:59.235 --> 06:04.070
We are transporting a very
dangerous criminal.

06:44.238 --> 06:47.105
What's her crime?

06:47.199 --> 06:50.362
Nothing you need concern
yourself about.

06:51.495 --> 06:53.201
Our quarters?

06:53.289 --> 06:55.780
D'Argo:
They're ready. This way.

06:55.874 --> 06:58.866
lwi|l supervise the repairs
to our ship personally.

06:58.961 --> 07:02.499
D'Argo:
The DRDs have nearly completed
their damage assessment.

07:05.676 --> 07:09.214
Have you ever been stung
by the watruka plant?

07:09.305 --> 07:10.590
Not yet.

07:10.681 --> 07:14.173
Salis:
They, too, present an
intriguing exterior.

07:14.268 --> 07:16.600
Yeah. Appearances can
be deceiving.

07:16.687 --> 07:20.646
I'm sure the same has often
been said about me.

07:21.525 --> 07:23.231
Please...

07:24.320 --> 07:25.275
Help me.

07:25.362 --> 07:26.943
Chiana.

07:27.031 --> 07:30.273
They won't tell you what I've
done because they're
embarrassed.

07:31.035 --> 07:32.525
You...

07:32.620 --> 07:34.656
You wouldn't consider
it a crime.

07:34.747 --> 07:38.160
But we do and that's enough.

07:38.250 --> 07:40.241
I beg you.

07:40.336 --> 07:42.497
I beg you for amnesty.

07:42.588 --> 07:46.251
We're not a diplomatic ship.

07:46.342 --> 07:49.926
Then use moral authority,
please.

07:50.012 --> 07:51.718
What they're going to do to me
is cruel by anyone's...

07:51.805 --> 07:52.794
(electronic whining)

07:52.890 --> 07:56.724
(gasping and choking)

08:02.358 --> 08:03.723
Stop it!

08:06.904 --> 08:09.065
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

08:09.156 --> 08:11.317
Her behavior was inappropriate,

08:11.408 --> 08:14.195
which is why she wears a collar
in the first place.

08:14.286 --> 08:16.447
ldon't give a damn if she's
an axe murderer, Elvis.

08:16.538 --> 08:18.278
She was just talking to me.

08:18.374 --> 08:25.212
You crippled our ship,
endangered our lives,
disrupted our plans.

08:25.297 --> 08:30.166
Are you now the arbiter of our
justice system as well?

08:32.554 --> 08:35.341
Zhaan:
The Nebari practice mind
control?

08:35.432 --> 08:40.552
We simply eliminated those
thought patterns that led him
to behave inappropriately.

08:40.646 --> 08:43.262
Eliminated?

08:43.357 --> 08:47.771
A process of neural realignment
so intricate that each subject

08:47.861 --> 08:52.275
must be placed under cryonic
suspension for nearly
100 cycles.

08:52.366 --> 08:54.322
So it is the real Durka.

08:54.410 --> 08:58.653
Zhaan:
And what does each subject
feel during this... this "treatment"?

08:58.747 --> 09:02.365
Durka appreciates what
we did for him.

09:02.459 --> 09:05.542
Ask him if you don't
believe me.

09:05.629 --> 09:08.587
Perhaps I will.

09:08.674 --> 09:12.792
Had it been possible, we would
have saved everyone aboard
the Zelbinion,

09:12.886 --> 09:14.467
not just Captain Durka.

09:14.555 --> 09:16.261
Why was it not possible?

09:16.348 --> 09:19.590
They refused to surrender.

09:19.685 --> 09:22.722
You defeated a Peacekeeper
Command Carrier?

09:22.813 --> 09:24.428
How many warships did it take?

09:24.523 --> 09:26.229
We have no warships.

09:26.316 --> 09:30.309
One of our standard host
vessels engaged the Zelbinion,

09:30.404 --> 09:34.864
much like the one coming for us.

09:38.704 --> 09:41.070
( knife being sharpened )

09:46.879 --> 09:48.460
Get out of my quarters.

09:51.300 --> 09:52.961
What are you up to, Rygel?

09:53.051 --> 09:54.791
Nothing.

09:54.887 --> 09:58.220
I'm just sitting here
reflecting on my fond memories
of Durka and the Zelbinion.

09:58.307 --> 09:59.638
Great. Reflect all you like,

09:59.725 --> 10:02.307
but you will leave the visitors
alone, is that clear?

10:02.394 --> 10:03.554
Visitors?

10:03.645 --> 10:06.352
Has Moya turned into a Glendian
pleasure vessel now?

10:06.440 --> 10:08.977
I'm just here to make sure that
you don't think it's a
goodidea

10:09.067 --> 10:11.934
to run amok on some
childish vendetta.

10:12.029 --> 10:14.941
That is a sadistic madman
out there.

10:15.032 --> 10:16.238
So you have claimed.

10:16.325 --> 10:18.190
l was there!

10:18.285 --> 10:21.823
Imprisoned on board the
Zelbinion nearly a hundred
cycles before you were born?

10:21.914 --> 10:24.451
What do you know of Durka?
Nothing!

10:24.541 --> 10:28.625
Actually, I was taught a great
deal about Captain Durka's
distinguished career.

10:28.712 --> 10:31.249
Force fed a pack of
Peacekeeper propaganda!

10:31.340 --> 10:34.707
Ha! And what did you think when
we came upon the wreck of
the Zelbinion

10:34.802 --> 10:38.135
and found that your brave
captain had shot himself?

10:38.222 --> 10:39.462
Simply this.

10:39.556 --> 10:41.262
You said that you
found his corpse.

10:41.350 --> 10:43.261
Obviously you were mistaken.

10:43.352 --> 10:48.892
Apparently he chose to end his
distinguished career by faking
his own death,

10:48.982 --> 10:52.566
all to save himself whilst his
crew died around him.

10:52.653 --> 10:54.314
You don't know what happened.

10:54.404 --> 10:56.565
I know all I need to.

10:56.657 --> 10:58.818
Durka is alive.

10:59.368 --> 11:01.484
(gasping)

11:01.578 --> 11:03.830
See that he stays that way.

11:15.217 --> 11:18.334
Aeryn:
I must say I am more
than curious.

11:18.428 --> 11:21.386
I studied all your achievements
at Peacekeeper training.

11:21.473 --> 11:25.341
I achieved nothing as a
Peacekeepeh

11:26.353 --> 11:29.265
The liberation of Mintaka
Three?

11:29.356 --> 11:31.187
The quelling of the
Cenobian rebellion?

11:31.275 --> 11:33.516
These are legendary.

11:33.610 --> 11:34.895
No.

11:34.987 --> 11:39.276
These are meaningless,
brute-force solutions.

11:40.617 --> 11:43.233
The Nebari showed me
a better way.

11:43.328 --> 11:46.445
The Nebari took over the
Zelbinion and killed your crew.

11:46.540 --> 11:49.498
We had invaded their sector.

11:50.836 --> 11:53.043
How did you survive
their attack?

11:53.130 --> 11:57.749
| faked my death and left
on an escape pod.

11:58.427 --> 12:00.292
You deserted your ship?

12:01.763 --> 12:05.426
l have done far worse
in my time.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.562
( knocks )

12:16.028 --> 12:17.518
I thought you might be hungry.

12:17.613 --> 12:19.194
lam.

12:19.823 --> 12:21.233
Thanks.

12:30.292 --> 12:32.283
Not very tasty.

12:32.377 --> 12:33.913
Nope.

12:34.004 --> 12:36.416
But it's the best we have.

12:44.473 --> 12:46.634
They're pretty worried
about you.

12:46.725 --> 12:49.011
Well, of course they are.

12:50.020 --> 12:51.180
l, uh...

12:51.271 --> 12:53.933
I don't respect authority.

12:54.024 --> 12:57.437
I do what I want when
I want to do it.

12:58.862 --> 13:01.478
Is that the only reason
you're in there?

13:01.573 --> 13:03.029
Look, this... this is stupid.

13:03.116 --> 13:05.778
I'm not going to eat like this.

13:05.869 --> 13:10.203
l, uh, I appreciate your
trying, though.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.410
So, you were about to tell me
why Salis and Durka

13:16.505 --> 13:20.839
went to so much trouble to
bring you back.

13:20.926 --> 13:25.386
Because I left the half-dead
sanctimoniousness of my planet
the first chance I got.

13:26.098 --> 13:27.258
l, uh...

13:27.349 --> 13:29.340
I stole food when l was hungry.

13:29.434 --> 13:32.301
Jumped transport
without voucher.

13:32.396 --> 13:35.980
Defended myself when necessary.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.182
Did you ever kill anyone?

13:40.195 --> 13:41.981
They tell you I did?

13:42.072 --> 13:43.733
I'm asking you.

13:44.199 --> 13:45.655
No.

13:45.742 --> 13:49.234
Then help me understand the
collar and the cuffs.

13:50.706 --> 13:54.665
Among my people, you...
you conform.

13:55.752 --> 13:59.244
You don't do the things I...
I did.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.251
What will they do with you now?

14:02.342 --> 14:04.799
Same thing as Durka.

14:04.886 --> 14:07.093
Mental cleansing into a...

14:07.180 --> 14:09.296
into an obedient zombie.

14:10.308 --> 14:12.219
They do that to their own kind?

14:12.310 --> 14:15.768
Gah. They do that to anybody
they please.

14:15.856 --> 14:18.848
They think they're doing
you a favor.

14:19.317 --> 14:21.103
Like hell.

14:21.194 --> 14:22.900
Not to me, they're not.

14:22.988 --> 14:24.524
No...

14:24.614 --> 14:26.320
lwon't let 'em!

14:26.408 --> 14:27.989
Chiana, relax.

14:28.076 --> 14:29.316
You relax.

14:29.411 --> 14:31.618
They're not going to frell with
your brain, are they?

14:31.705 --> 14:34.788
No, and they're not going to
with mine, either.

14:34.875 --> 14:36.365
I'd rather be dead!

14:36.460 --> 14:38.416
Chiana, stop it!

14:42.132 --> 14:43.338
Easy.

14:45.177 --> 14:47.589
It's all right.
You're all right.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.344
Don't let them take me.

14:50.432 --> 14:51.763
Please.

14:56.688 --> 14:58.770
You're all right.

15:07.074 --> 15:09.110
Crichton:
According to Chiana

15:09.201 --> 15:13.786
the Nebari mental cleansing is
a bit like brainwashing.

15:14.998 --> 15:17.284
No.

15:17.375 --> 15:21.334
It is more a correction.

15:22.422 --> 15:23.798
Crichton:
There's a difference?

15:23.882 --> 15:25.622
Durka:
Yes.

15:25.717 --> 15:33.010
As much as a difference
between a knife attack and
life-saving surgery.

15:33.975 --> 15:36.591
(yelling)

15:36.686 --> 15:40.349
Zhaan! Zhaan! Moya's
detected explosions in
the Maintenance Bay.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.476
John! Aeryn! Anyone!

15:42.567 --> 15:45.229
Zhaan, stay put.
D'Argo, meet me down there.

16:08.760 --> 16:10.671
(shrieks)

16:15.267 --> 16:17.178
(grunting)

16:30.407 --> 16:31.487
You!

16:31.575 --> 16:34.442
You set off a bomb inside
the damned ship?

16:34.536 --> 16:36.117
He grabbed me. He tried
to strangle me!

16:36.204 --> 16:38.195
Crichton:
He's been brain-neutered,
you moron.

16:38.290 --> 16:39.370
Crichton!

16:39.457 --> 16:41.789
This bastard just tried
to frag us.

16:41.877 --> 16:43.413
Did not.

16:43.503 --> 16:46.711
Yeah he did, and I'm ready to
kick his sorry ass off the
ship right now!

16:46.798 --> 16:49.289
Listen to me. He isn't cured.

16:49.384 --> 16:50.999
I saw it in his face.

16:51.094 --> 16:53.551
The evil, it was there!

16:53.638 --> 17:00.134
My presence obviously seems
to give you great pain.

17:00.228 --> 17:07.976
With Salis's permission, I
shall confine myself to areas
outside your sight.

17:08.069 --> 17:09.195
No.

17:09.279 --> 17:11.565
We'll lock Rygel up first.

17:16.119 --> 17:19.907
You stupid Luxan! I am trying
to save us from that maniac!

17:19.998 --> 17:23.240
A ship capable of destroying
the Zelbinion is headed
our way.

17:23.335 --> 17:26.418
We do not want to make
them our enemies.

17:26.504 --> 17:27.960
Salis!

17:28.048 --> 17:29.288
What's going on?

17:29.382 --> 17:31.714
There was an explosion.

17:33.845 --> 17:36.507
You thought I had something
to do with the blast?

17:36.598 --> 17:39.260
That was my first
assumption, yes.

17:39.351 --> 17:42.935
Well, switch to your
second assumption.

17:43.021 --> 17:45.057
I had nothing to do with it.

17:46.691 --> 17:50.275
I can never believe you, Chiana.

17:51.613 --> 17:53.319
Remain calm.

17:53.406 --> 17:55.863
We'll be home soon.

17:55.951 --> 17:57.691
Didn't you ever...

17:57.786 --> 17:59.777
ever want to travel?

18:00.580 --> 18:03.162
See other places?

18:03.250 --> 18:06.333
Do other things?

18:06.419 --> 18:09.536
Yes, and l have.

18:09.631 --> 18:11.667
When you were my age?

18:11.758 --> 18:16.343
When I was your age I was
focused on what I could
do to fit in,

18:16.429 --> 18:18.260
not stand apart.

18:18.348 --> 18:20.555
But I thought my...

18:20.642 --> 18:24.430
my "standing apart"
appealed to you.

18:25.438 --> 18:28.805
| see the way you look at me.

18:29.859 --> 18:32.191
You want to run your hands
around again?

18:33.530 --> 18:36.772
(gasping and choking)

18:40.912 --> 18:43.824
Remain calm.

18:43.915 --> 18:46.622
(panting)

18:49.629 --> 18:52.245
I'm perfectly calm.

18:53.925 --> 18:56.166
I found this in Rygel's
quarters.

18:56.261 --> 19:00.220
It's Jelifan fire paste,
stevva crystals and detonators.

19:00.307 --> 19:04.346
Fortunately, the ignorant
Hynerian got all the
proportions wrong.

19:04.436 --> 19:06.927
Not enough stevva crystals.

19:07.022 --> 19:09.809
And if he had gotten them right?

19:09.899 --> 19:13.357
Well, we wouldn't be having
this conversation now.

19:17.699 --> 19:21.908
Pilot:
The explosion does not seem to
have damaged Moya's systems.

19:21.995 --> 19:24.236
What if he tries again?

19:24.331 --> 19:27.573
He won't. He's locked in his
quarters under restraint.

19:27.667 --> 19:31.785
You will of course turn him
over to me when the host
ship arrives.

19:31.880 --> 19:33.962
I will do nothing of the sort.

19:34.049 --> 19:40.136
He has serious flaws in his
character that must be
corrected.

19:40.221 --> 19:43.679
Even Rygel, with his many
faults, does not deserve that.

19:43.767 --> 19:48.932
There are many aspects of your
character that would benefit
from adjustment.

19:54.069 --> 19:56.526
My point exactly.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.450
( handcuffs springing open )

20:14.422 --> 20:16.663
(doors whoosh open )

20:16.758 --> 20:18.089
Who is that?

20:18.176 --> 20:20.258
I'm in no mood for visitors.

20:20.345 --> 20:21.551
( doors whoosh closed )

20:21.638 --> 20:23.879
ls someone there?

20:23.973 --> 20:25.804
Pilot, are you playing
with the doors?

20:25.892 --> 20:29.134
Quiet down, or I'll have
to hurt you.

20:29.229 --> 20:31.094
Quiet, you toad!

20:31.189 --> 20:32.554
Let's deal.

20:32.649 --> 20:34.981
All right, we both want
something, don't we?

20:35.068 --> 20:38.811
You want to be untied so you
can kill Durka, right?

20:38.905 --> 20:41.942
And what I want is to
get off this ship.

20:42.033 --> 20:44.240
You got any problems with that?

20:44.327 --> 20:46.409
We're making great progress.

20:46.496 --> 20:50.034
You scream, I push this cushion
down to your colon.

20:52.961 --> 20:54.872
(gasping)

20:55.338 --> 20:56.669
Untie me.

20:56.756 --> 20:59.293
Ha! Typical male.

20:59.384 --> 21:01.670
Satisfy yourself first.

21:01.761 --> 21:04.218
I can tell you exactly how to
get to the transport hangar

21:04.305 --> 21:07.263
and what codes will
open the door.

21:07.350 --> 21:09.056
Got to do better.

21:09.144 --> 21:12.227
I can find it myself and
crack the door code.

21:12.313 --> 21:14.975
I got in here, didn't I?

21:15.066 --> 21:18.650
I can create a diversion and
draw everyone away from
the hangar.

21:18.736 --> 21:21.728
They'll be too busy chasing me
to bother with you.

21:24.284 --> 21:25.444
Okay.

21:28.288 --> 21:29.528
l, uh...

21:29.622 --> 21:33.240
I apologize for calling
you a toad.

21:33.334 --> 21:36.041
| make allowances for
stress on this ship.

21:36.838 --> 21:38.499
Oh, no.

21:38.590 --> 21:41.377
This isn't stress, old man.

21:41.468 --> 21:46.428
Stress is if you don't come
through for me.

21:50.685 --> 21:53.427
The Nebari woman's escaped!
She's in my quarters.

21:54.439 --> 21:55.804
Rygel?

21:57.275 --> 21:58.230
Rygel.

21:58.318 --> 22:00.183
Rygel, you better not be lying!

22:00.278 --> 22:03.065
lf Chiana has escaped she'll
probably head here.

22:03.156 --> 22:04.692
I'll wait here for them.

22:05.742 --> 22:07.278
Salis?

22:07.368 --> 22:09.700
Chiana may have escaped.

22:09.787 --> 22:12.164
(sighs)

22:13.249 --> 22:15.285
Find her.

22:15.376 --> 22:18.709
Make sure the others know that
she's capable of violence.

22:18.796 --> 22:20.878
So are we.

22:22.884 --> 22:24.795
(muffled groaning )

22:29.057 --> 22:31.343
(muffled groaning continues)

22:38.566 --> 22:40.306
I guess he wasn't lying.

22:41.110 --> 22:42.486
( spitting )

22:42.570 --> 22:45.152
She's headed for the hangar.
Wants to steal a transport.

22:45.240 --> 22:48.903
Zhaan, we got a problem.
Chiana's on the loose.

22:49.619 --> 22:51.701
Pilot, get the DRDs searching.

22:51.788 --> 22:53.198
Wait! Wait! Untie me!

22:53.289 --> 22:55.120
l'll-l'll help you search.

22:55.208 --> 22:57.620
I'm the one who told you
she'd escaped.

23:07.345 --> 23:09.586
(electronic pulsing )

23:12.225 --> 23:15.513
The DRDs are searching all
the atmosphere ducts.

23:16.437 --> 23:19.224
John, no sign of her
on tier three.

23:19.315 --> 23:20.566
Got it, Zhaan.

23:23.778 --> 23:25.359
Keep searching. D'Argo?

23:26.447 --> 23:28.278
She won't get by me.

23:41.087 --> 23:43.999
Aeryn:
Oh, you can do it yourself
Rygel, then.

23:44.090 --> 23:46.206
Ah, that hurts.

23:49.887 --> 23:51.388
Rygel:
Agh!

23:51.472 --> 23:53.087
Get him away from me!

23:53.850 --> 23:55.590
I can't find Chiana.

23:55.685 --> 23:58.097
ls someone guarding the Command?

23:58.187 --> 23:59.222
Why?

23:59.314 --> 24:01.179
Is she capable of taking
over the ship?

24:01.274 --> 24:02.514
Possibly.

24:02.609 --> 24:05.316
She is capable of anything.

24:06.613 --> 24:09.195
Crichton, there's movement
on your tier.

24:09.282 --> 24:11.443
There's movement on your tier!

24:34.974 --> 24:37.306
Zhaan:
Chiana did this?

24:37.393 --> 24:39.133
Looks like it.

24:39.228 --> 24:41.014
(sighs)

24:41.105 --> 24:44.893
Considering what Salis had
in mind for her, I can't
be surprised.

24:44.984 --> 24:48.101
The question is, how are the
Nebari going to react?

24:49.280 --> 24:52.738
We better find her before she
racks up another victim.

25:01.292 --> 25:02.577
Come on, Rygel.

25:02.669 --> 25:04.876
Rygel:
Right behind you.

25:06.547 --> 25:10.039
Pilot, any reports
from the DRDs?

25:10.134 --> 25:11.510
Pilot:
No trace of her.

25:11.594 --> 25:15.132
She's very good at
staying hidden.

25:15.223 --> 25:17.259
D'Argo:
If you see Chiana,

25:17.350 --> 25:18.931
shoot to kill.

25:19.769 --> 25:21.976
If you insist.

25:30.363 --> 25:33.571
Did I overhear correctly?

25:34.575 --> 25:38.944
Salis is dead?

25:39.914 --> 25:41.245
Yes, I'm sorry.

25:44.252 --> 25:46.334
No.

25:47.380 --> 25:50.167
Please, no...

25:51.467 --> 25:54.880
Salis cannot be dead.

25:59.934 --> 26:01.640
(grunting)

26:01.728 --> 26:02.888
( groans )

26:05.982 --> 26:07.188
(grunts)

26:13.948 --> 26:15.233
(grunting)

26:27.462 --> 26:29.703
D'Argo, l'm halfway through
tier four.

26:29.797 --> 26:31.082
No sign of Chiana.

26:31.174 --> 26:33.005
You got anything there yet?

26:34.385 --> 26:35.921
Hey...

26:38.890 --> 26:40.721
D'Argo, you read me?

26:45.354 --> 26:47.561
What do you think you're doing?!

26:47.648 --> 26:49.149
(gasps )

26:50.234 --> 26:53.271
Crichton. D'Argo. Zhaan.

26:53.362 --> 26:55.102
Can anyone hear me?

26:55.198 --> 26:56.358
Come in.

26:58.701 --> 27:01.989
Not good.

27:49.377 --> 27:51.083
(gasping)

27:55.174 --> 27:55.959
Hello,

27:56.050 --> 27:56.800
(gasping)

27:56.884 --> 27:59.216
Rygel.

27:59.303 --> 28:03.888
You undid the Nebari
mental cleansing.

28:05.142 --> 28:10.057
Isn't that the most superb
irony?

28:10.147 --> 28:12.354
(coughs):
Durka.

28:12.441 --> 28:17.401
And now, Officer Sun
rejoins us.

28:19.282 --> 28:21.398
l was just about to tell Rygel

28:21.492 --> 28:27.488
how good it feels to be back
in my right mind.

28:28.332 --> 28:31.495
While I was cleansed,

28:31.586 --> 28:37.673
l genuinely felt ashamed of who
I was and what I'd done.

28:37.758 --> 28:42.172
But do you know, thinking
about it now,

28:42.263 --> 28:44.299
l have no idea why.

28:45.683 --> 28:48.299
I take it you murdered Salis.

28:56.402 --> 29:01.362
It's the simple things
you really miss.

29:01.449 --> 29:06.068
( breath shaking )

29:06.162 --> 29:07.698
(gasps )

29:11.834 --> 29:14.997
Crew of Moya,

29:15.087 --> 29:18.204
this is Captain Selto Durka,

29:18.299 --> 29:23.464
the new commander of
this Leviathan.

29:23.554 --> 29:26.296
I am in complete control
of this ship

29:26.390 --> 29:31.805
and I am holding Rygel and
Officer Sun hostage.

29:31.896 --> 29:35.605
You will leave this ship
immediately

29:35.691 --> 29:37.227
or you will die.

29:37.318 --> 29:39.274
Crichton, Durka murdered Sal...

29:42.573 --> 29:44.359
Anybody?

29:45.910 --> 29:47.616
Durka, talk to me!

29:47.703 --> 29:50.115
Crichton!

29:50.206 --> 29:52.242
Zhaan, respond!

29:52.333 --> 29:54.369
(growling)

30:01.968 --> 30:03.424
(yells)

30:05.972 --> 30:07.553
Crap!

30:10.434 --> 30:12.095
Pilot:
Zhaan?

30:12.186 --> 30:15.303
Thank goodness. That madman's
taken over half of Moya's
systems.

30:15.398 --> 30:17.810
Even the Comms are under
his control.

30:17.900 --> 30:19.401
Can you override, Pilot?

30:19.485 --> 30:21.350
He knows every synaptic bypass.

30:21.445 --> 30:23.697
Every countermeasure I take,
he anticipates.

30:23.781 --> 30:27.899
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, point that
thing somewhere else.

30:27.994 --> 30:29.109
You heard Durka's ultimatum?

30:29.203 --> 30:30.784
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:30.871 --> 30:32.998
Nebari mental cleansing doesn't
get the tough stains out.

30:33.082 --> 30:35.664
Even with the hostages,
we must retake command.

30:35.751 --> 30:37.127
Right. You got a plan?

30:37.211 --> 30:38.371
( snickers )

30:38.462 --> 30:40.748
Have I got a plan?

30:43.384 --> 30:45.796
This hatch leads directly
to command.

30:45.886 --> 30:46.841
Are you sure?

30:46.929 --> 30:48.214
Just look for the girl.

30:48.305 --> 30:50.387
Look, I'm not too sure
that she...

30:52.435 --> 30:55.268
Hey, try not to fall out
of the ship again.

30:55.354 --> 30:57.140
I'll do my best.

30:57.231 --> 31:01.315
There appears to be an
obstruction in the access shaft.

31:01.402 --> 31:05.270
l was wondering how long it
would take someone to try that.

31:07.199 --> 31:08.735
(grunts)

31:15.708 --> 31:16.493
D'Argo?!

31:16.584 --> 31:18.540
Crichton!

31:19.962 --> 31:23.546
Witnessing a legend in action.

31:25.217 --> 31:30.132
This must be quite a privilege
for you, Officer Sun.

31:30.222 --> 31:31.837
(chuckling)

31:31.932 --> 31:35.060
You're not a legend, Durka.
I take that back.

31:35.144 --> 31:36.930
You're a disgrace.

31:37.021 --> 31:41.560
Because I had the intelligence
to know when to retreat.

31:41.650 --> 31:44.858
Ah, but you didn't retreat when
the Nebari took the Zelbinion.

31:44.945 --> 31:47.231
You ran.

31:47.323 --> 31:51.066
The crew of the Zelbinion
is dead.

31:51.160 --> 31:52.696
I am not.

31:54.288 --> 31:56.654
Officer Sun,

31:56.749 --> 32:01.584
how is it you're not a
Peacekeeper anymore?

32:04.381 --> 32:09.421
The one thing I've always
admired about these Leviathans

32:09.512 --> 32:14.256
is their wonderful talent
for Starburst.

32:17.019 --> 32:21.137
Say goodbye to the
Nebari sector.

32:21.232 --> 32:22.517
(engine powering up)

32:22.608 --> 32:24.519
Starburst?

32:24.610 --> 32:27.352
I thought we couldn't Starburst.

32:30.407 --> 32:33.615
(engine powering down )

32:39.166 --> 32:41.623
Score one up for the underdogs.

32:41.710 --> 32:47.296
Because of her child, Moya is
unable to Starburst for several
more arns at least.

32:47.383 --> 32:49.624
He's obviously not aware
that Moya's pregnant,

32:49.718 --> 32:52.425
but he's sure to find out about
the pregnancy soon enough.

32:53.430 --> 32:56.046
Crew of Moya,

32:56.142 --> 33:01.387
you will reactivate Starburst
immediately,

33:01.480 --> 33:06.270
or I will kill the hostages.

33:52.114 --> 33:54.321
Come on out, Chiana.

33:56.535 --> 33:59.743
Look, I don't have time
to play this game.

33:59.830 --> 34:03.163
Durka's gone Hannibal
Lecter on us.

34:03.250 --> 34:06.162
Chiana:
I don't know what that means.

34:06.253 --> 34:08.790
And why bother me, anyway?

34:08.881 --> 34:10.587
(Chiana laughing)

34:10.674 --> 34:13.086
I'm just here to talk.

34:16.388 --> 34:18.424
Still nothing.

34:21.393 --> 34:22.769
Attention.

34:22.853 --> 34:30.225
Despite my demands, Starburst
is still non-operational.

34:30.319 --> 34:39.660
Perhaps it might expedite
matters if I leave the
channel open this time.

34:39.745 --> 34:42.282
Aeryn:
This won't help you.

34:42.373 --> 34:47.117
You have studied my
techniques Officer Sun.

34:47.211 --> 34:52.797
You know very well how good
I am at getting results.

34:54.051 --> 34:58.044
Rygel,

34:58.138 --> 35:07.058
do you know what we Sebaceans
dislike more than anything else?

35:07.314 --> 35:09.179
Heat.

35:11.318 --> 35:14.401
Intense heat.

35:22.371 --> 35:28.162
To think this could have
been avoided.

35:29.586 --> 35:32.248
Durka, you are pathetic.

35:32.339 --> 35:36.252
Look at you, salivating at the
chance to maim and kill someone

35:36.343 --> 35:38.208
who can't even defend herself.

35:38.304 --> 35:41.671
Foaming at the mouth like
a sick trelkez.

35:41.765 --> 35:44.097
Pathetic.

35:44.184 --> 35:48.097
Why, Rygel, what's this?

35:48.188 --> 35:50.804
Something I should have said
to you a long time ago.

35:50.899 --> 35:52.605
Durka:
Yet you didn't.

35:53.819 --> 36:00.156
l was going to save you for
a bargaining tool,

36:00.242 --> 36:02.153
but now I'm wondering,

36:02.244 --> 36:10.333
do you think your shipmates
would really care if I just
burnt your face right off?

36:10.419 --> 36:13.957
Go ahead and find out.
I don't care.

36:14.048 --> 36:18.417
Because the all-powerful
Durka is a failure.

36:19.386 --> 36:21.593
It's the truth, Durka.

36:21.680 --> 36:26.390
You tortured me without mercy,
but you never broke me.

36:26.477 --> 36:29.014
You only made me stronger.

36:29.104 --> 36:32.062
And even if you kill me,
I'll be laughing at you,

36:32.149 --> 36:36.688
because the last thing I'll
think of is you on Nebari Prime
for another hundred cycles

36:36.779 --> 36:40.567
being ground back down
into nothing.

36:40.657 --> 36:45.196
This Leviathan you've
commandeered is pregnant.

36:46.288 --> 36:49.155
Aeryn:
Check the nutrient flow.

36:49.249 --> 36:51.786
Look at the power levels.

36:51.877 --> 36:55.244
All those resources are going
somewhere, aren't they?

36:55.339 --> 36:58.422
Moya's diverting energy
to her baby.

36:58.509 --> 37:00.716
Get ready to greet the
Nebari, Durka,

37:00.803 --> 37:04.842
because there's nothing you can
do to get Starburst back.

37:06.433 --> 37:08.640
Yes there is.

37:12.106 --> 37:13.971
Chiana:
Turn around.

37:16.735 --> 37:18.646
l'm unarmed.

37:18.737 --> 37:20.398
Turn around.

37:23.075 --> 37:24.235
Listen.

37:26.537 --> 37:27.822
( screaming )

37:30.207 --> 37:32.163
(coughing)

37:35.045 --> 37:37.457
You okay?

37:37.548 --> 37:39.709
Are you finished?

37:41.218 --> 37:43.300
I'm sorry.

37:45.389 --> 37:47.425
I'm not used to trusting
anybody.

37:47.516 --> 37:50.258
| suggest you start.

37:52.646 --> 37:57.561
How could Durka have broken
the... the mental cleansing?

37:57.651 --> 37:59.266
It's irreversible.

37:59.361 --> 38:01.147
It's not my department.

38:01.238 --> 38:04.150
Take that up with your mental
engineers.

38:04.241 --> 38:07.608
That's why he wants to get
away from here so bad,

38:07.703 --> 38:12.242
'cause he's afraid my people
will recondition him.

38:13.709 --> 38:16.542
Well, that's something
you have in common.

38:16.628 --> 38:19.415
Might be able to use that
against him.

38:19.506 --> 38:24.296
Well, maybe it's to my
advantage to team up with him.

38:24.386 --> 38:28.299
Do you have a hearing
problem, Chiana?

38:28.390 --> 38:31.928
Durka's insane. He's a
psychopath. Legendary.

38:32.019 --> 38:37.184
And nobody knows what a
hundred years of happy meals
have done to him.

38:37.274 --> 38:40.266
You could end up with
your throat cut.

38:41.904 --> 38:44.566
Maybe.

38:44.656 --> 38:47.398
But I know how to hide.

38:47.493 --> 38:50.451
I know how to disappear.

38:50.537 --> 38:55.076
Do you know how to
breathe vacuum?

38:55.167 --> 38:56.452
He doesn't have to find you.

38:56.543 --> 39:00.536
He can shut off the life support
everywhere except for Command.

39:02.424 --> 39:05.257
Commit, Chiana.

39:05.344 --> 39:09.963
You're with us, or you're
on your own.

39:11.767 --> 39:15.851
When my people find out
what happened to Salis,

39:15.938 --> 39:18.725
they're going to want to
cleanse the lot of you.

39:20.567 --> 39:22.353
Yeah.

39:24.029 --> 39:26.987
I guess that makes us
natural allies.

39:29.201 --> 39:30.862
Alright then.

39:30.953 --> 39:33.114
What's your plan?

39:35.249 --> 39:39.868
Why do | always get stuck with
the greebols that don't
have any plan?

39:40.420 --> 39:41.751
No, no.

39:41.838 --> 39:44.295
I've got a plan.

39:44.383 --> 39:45.964
You're just not going
to like it.

39:46.051 --> 39:47.257
Why?

39:47.344 --> 39:49.300
'Cause I don't like it.

39:49.388 --> 39:52.221
I don't trust you any more
than you trust me.

39:54.601 --> 39:56.307
Fair enough.

39:56.395 --> 39:57.851
Let's hear it.

40:00.816 --> 40:02.602
Bait.

40:14.454 --> 40:20.040
You are very resourceful,
young Nebari.

40:20.669 --> 40:22.876
Make it work for you.

40:23.547 --> 40:24.787
Here's the news.

40:24.881 --> 40:26.496
The ship's pregnant.

40:26.592 --> 40:32.132
We kill the baby, and we can
Starburst the draz out of here.

40:32.222 --> 40:34.258
New information please.

40:34.349 --> 40:35.759
Or you'll die.

40:37.227 --> 40:40.014
You think the baby's
down there?

40:40.105 --> 40:45.316
How bad did they mess with that
great military mind of
yours, anyway?

40:46.987 --> 40:49.399
Where did you get the
directions?

40:49.489 --> 40:51.320
From the ship?

40:51.408 --> 40:53.023
Right.

40:54.119 --> 40:55.780
Shoot me.

40:59.625 --> 41:01.365
What do you know?

41:01.460 --> 41:05.749
They've reconfigured data to
send you in the wrong direction.

41:05.839 --> 41:07.795
A trap.

41:07.883 --> 41:10.124
And why should I believe you?

41:10.218 --> 41:13.085
Because we both want the
same thing.

41:21.897 --> 41:23.307
Hey!

41:24.983 --> 41:26.393
No, no, no.

41:26.485 --> 41:29.352
Let... let me go first.

41:29.446 --> 41:31.653
There's a hatchway through
there.

41:31.740 --> 41:34.026
It leads straight to the
birthing chamber.

41:34.117 --> 41:35.948
I don't like dark rooms.

41:36.036 --> 41:43.124
Yeah? Well, some froth-mouth
with a metal eye shutoff
all the lights.

41:43.210 --> 41:45.326
Durka:
And how is it you
know this room?

41:45.420 --> 41:48.503
I did a lot of crawling through
the ship's ducts.

41:48.590 --> 41:52.333
That's how I... I stumbled
across the baby.

41:52.427 --> 41:54.338
Did you, indeed?

41:56.264 --> 41:57.515
No!

42:06.483 --> 42:09.771
It isn't that easy, Crichton.

42:11.488 --> 42:13.570
(Chiana whimpering)

42:15.033 --> 42:15.943
You okay?

42:16.034 --> 42:17.319
Your stupid plan.

42:17.411 --> 42:21.154
In the room. I said to get
him in the room!

42:21.248 --> 42:23.113
You said to the room!

42:23.208 --> 42:24.869
-Let me see.
-No! Frell that.

42:24.960 --> 42:26.370
He's going to kill us
all anyway.

42:26.461 --> 42:29.453
Go get the... get the bastard.

42:42.602 --> 42:43.933
Can we get control of the door?

42:44.020 --> 42:45.226
I'm trying.

42:49.693 --> 42:51.149
(yelling)

42:56.366 --> 42:57.321
Dammit!

43:10.505 --> 43:11.585
Zhaan:
John!

43:12.632 --> 43:13.838
John!

43:21.558 --> 43:23.389
Hey, Durka!

43:23.477 --> 43:26.014
How far do you think you're
going to get without your
propulsion control?

43:26.104 --> 43:29.688
All I need is the Transport's
Phase Cannon.

43:29.775 --> 43:35.190
One shot into Moya's midsection
will solve the Starburst
problem.

43:36.698 --> 43:39.735
Pilot, stand by. We're going
to give Durka the boot.

43:39.826 --> 43:41.532
Pilot:
He's cut off the controls!

43:41.620 --> 43:43.986
I can't open the outer door.

43:44.080 --> 43:47.117
Damn it, Pilot, now's not the
time. Get control back.

43:47.209 --> 43:48.949
Pilot's onto it, John.

43:49.044 --> 43:50.625
The doors are malfunctioning!

43:50.712 --> 43:53.169
(motor sputtering )

43:53.256 --> 43:56.714
Those doors won't stop
this weapon.

43:56.802 --> 43:58.838
Come on, Durka.
Don't be an idiot.

43:58.929 --> 44:02.262
You think Moya's going to take
you out of here after you
kill her baby?

44:05.185 --> 44:07.767
His weapons are powering up.

44:07.854 --> 44:11.392
Durka:
Sorry to have to
cut this short.

44:21.993 --> 44:23.108
No.

44:23.203 --> 44:25.660
Shut the doors!

44:33.213 --> 44:34.623
Pilot:
That's done it!

44:34.714 --> 44:36.579
The outer doors are open.

44:41.179 --> 44:44.091
Pilot, shut the door!

44:44.182 --> 44:46.173
-Close the door!
-I'm trying!

44:46.268 --> 44:47.508
Zhaan:
John!

44:53.233 --> 44:54.643
Doors closing!

45:00.365 --> 45:02.026
Hold the door!

45:02.117 --> 45:04.073
Stop the doors!
Pilot, stop the doors!

45:04.160 --> 45:06.116
What?!

45:06.204 --> 45:10.322
Crichton! Open the hangar!
Now at once!

45:10.417 --> 45:13.204
Or I'll blast my way back in!

45:14.045 --> 45:15.706
Crichton!

45:18.049 --> 45:19.505
Hold the door!

45:19.593 --> 45:21.549
I can't stop them!

45:26.558 --> 45:27.798
(both yelling)

45:28.268 --> 45:29.633
I'm
ini

45:36.401 --> 45:40.144
Durka:
Crichton! Don't you leave
me out here.

45:40.238 --> 45:43.730
l'll hunt you down and
I'll kill you!

45:43.825 --> 45:46.032
Get in line, Durka.

45:46.119 --> 45:49.737
Besides, I don't think the
Nebari are going to let you
do a lot of hunting.

45:49.831 --> 45:53.073
Crichton! Listen to me!

45:53.168 --> 45:56.126
Give them my regards when
they pick you up.

45:56.212 --> 45:59.079
Durka:
Crichton!

45:59.174 --> 46:02.086
Crichton!

46:02.177 --> 46:04.168
If they pick you up.

46:05.347 --> 46:07.338
Either way,

46:08.975 --> 46:11.432
I don't really care.

46:14.439 --> 46:17.602
ls Moya still mad at me for
throwing that bomb?

46:18.193 --> 46:20.058
Moya understands.

46:20.153 --> 46:21.859
Crichton threw a bomb, too.

46:21.947 --> 46:26.566
But the one he threw stimulated
her to expel Durka's transport.

46:26.660 --> 46:28.571
I didn't know she could do that.

46:28.662 --> 46:30.402
Did you know she could do that?

46:30.497 --> 46:32.237
Moya didn't even know
she could do it.

46:32.332 --> 46:33.367
Oh.

46:33.458 --> 46:35.119
Pilot says she's still
in a lot of pain

46:35.210 --> 46:37.917
from the damage she caused
protecting her child.

46:38.004 --> 46:39.665
Mmm.

46:40.256 --> 46:41.917
Ah!

46:43.134 --> 46:44.249
You can have that back now.

46:44.344 --> 46:46.585
Sure now that I don't need it.

46:46.680 --> 46:49.513
You know, I neverthought I'd
say this to a Hynerian,
much less to you...

46:49.599 --> 46:50.975
Stop there.

46:51.059 --> 46:53.721
Ha ha ha. Don't you dare thank
me for saving your life.

46:53.812 --> 46:55.518
I wasn't going to.

46:55.605 --> 46:57.311
You weren't? Why not?

46:57.399 --> 47:00.186
Because amidst all that
unfinished business between
you and Durka,

47:00.276 --> 47:02.187
I don't think you even knew
I was there.

47:02.278 --> 47:04.314
Oh.

47:04.406 --> 47:06.362
But you handled yourself well.

47:06.449 --> 47:08.906
Hmm. I did, didn't I?

47:08.994 --> 47:10.859
Beat him at his own game.

47:14.290 --> 47:20.160
You just compared yourself
to a Peacekeeper.

47:24.592 --> 47:28.335
Zhaan:
Look, I have to find the pain
before I can remove it.

47:29.097 --> 47:30.086
Hold still.

47:30.181 --> 47:32.558
-Stop it!
-Shh!

47:32.642 --> 47:34.178
How's the patient?

47:35.270 --> 47:38.262
She's a brat.

47:38.356 --> 47:40.392
You want we should kick
her off the boat?

47:40.483 --> 47:43.270
( sighing ):
Ask me tomorrow.

47:44.612 --> 47:47.399
So, do | get to stay?

47:47.490 --> 47:50.948
Moya's gathering her strength
for a Starburst.

47:51.036 --> 47:53.618
That should put enough distance
between us and your people.

47:55.206 --> 47:57.197
Thanks.

48:00.920 --> 48:02.785
What's the matter?

48:03.548 --> 48:05.163
We have rules.

48:06.384 --> 48:07.840
Yeah?

48:07.927 --> 48:11.215
Well, when | see any of you
following them, so will I.

48:11.306 --> 48:13.012
l'm easy.

48:13.099 --> 48:14.760
I owe you.

48:14.851 --> 48:17.217
The others will not be
so forgiving.

48:19.647 --> 48:24.357
Well, just drop me off at the
next planet where there's
something worth stealing.

48:24.444 --> 48:27.481
This isn't a prison transport
anymore, Chiana.

48:27.572 --> 48:29.688
You can get off whenever
you want.

48:32.243 --> 48:34.234
One question.

48:38.249 --> 48:40.626
Where were you when Salis
was murdered?
