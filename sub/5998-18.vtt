WEBVTT

00:01.177 --> 00:02.744
I said Severide's name

00:02.746 --> 00:04.379
and your face turned all 50 shades of red.

00:04.381 --> 00:05.413
You guys know each other?

00:05.765 --> 00:07.331
Trudy Platt...

00:07.333 --> 00:10.201
Marrying you would be my greatest honor.

00:10.463 --> 00:13.430
I've done the cocktail parties,
I've gotten the message out.

00:13.432 --> 00:16.000
If that's not enough at
this point, then it's a wrap.

00:16.001 --> 00:18.035
He's so close and he's worked so hard.

00:18.037 --> 00:20.004
He's the right man to be Alderman.

00:22.308 --> 00:24.675
I won.

00:24.677 --> 00:26.443
Casey! Casey! Casey!

00:26.445 --> 00:27.545
Yeah!

00:29.104 --> 00:30.570
Hey, Alderman Casey!

00:30.572 --> 00:31.938
Alderman Casey, Alderman Casey.

00:32.235 --> 00:35.036
Electrical pole in my
backyard blocks my view.

00:35.038 --> 00:36.504
- Anything you can do?
- Alderman Casey,

00:36.506 --> 00:39.807
I have a pothole the size of
Lake Michigan on my street.

00:39.809 --> 00:43.110
Uh, some guy keeps pissing in the elevator

00:43.112 --> 00:45.546
in my and Cruz's building.

00:45.548 --> 00:46.647
Okay. All right.

00:46.649 --> 00:48.015
You guys feel free to write all that down

00:48.017 --> 00:49.883
and leave it on my desk.

00:49.905 --> 00:51.538
Oh, hey, check it out.

00:51.540 --> 00:54.942
"New alderman for the 52nd ward,

00:54.944 --> 00:56.610
Matthew Casey."

00:56.612 --> 00:57.745
Wow.

00:57.747 --> 00:59.780
Oh, "Casey with his wife by his side."

01:02.218 --> 01:04.985
Ha! Actually says wife.

01:04.986 --> 01:07.154
Damn, did I miss my own wedding?

01:07.156 --> 01:08.555
Well, I would have invited you,

01:08.557 --> 01:10.858
but you get so rowdy at parties.

01:10.860 --> 01:12.860
Ooh, Alderman speaks the truth.

01:12.862 --> 01:15.996
I'd kill to miss my wedding.

01:15.998 --> 01:19.033
Hey, hey, anybody want to write some vows?

01:19.035 --> 01:20.901
Hey, I got a smokin'
dress for that wedding.

01:20.903 --> 01:23.137
You better make it good.

01:28.377 --> 01:32.980
So, seriously, pothole is huge.

01:32.982 --> 01:35.916
Hey, do you have plans tomorrow night?

01:35.918 --> 01:38.952
Um, "Phantasm" is
showing at the Music Box.

01:38.954 --> 01:40.320
What's "Phantasm?"

01:40.322 --> 01:42.723
Come on, "Phantasm?" The tall man?

01:42.725 --> 01:45.159
The floating metallic sphere?

01:45.161 --> 01:46.960
Hey, Brett. Half-caf latte?

01:46.962 --> 01:50.064
Oh, thank you. You saved my life.

01:50.066 --> 01:53.033
So yeah, "Phantasm." It's a must-see.

01:53.035 --> 01:55.269
- What's "Phantasm?"
- It...

01:55.271 --> 01:57.337
Ambulance 61,

01:57.339 --> 02:00.841
man down from unknown
causes. 128 South Pulaski.

02:02.511 --> 02:05.446
So, "Phantasm" gonna happen?

02:05.448 --> 02:07.881
"Phantasm's" gonna happen.

02:08.002 --> 02:10.737
Trust me.

02:12.000 --> 02:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:20.262 --> 02:22.229
Fire department. Need help?

02:22.231 --> 02:25.265
Not me. Some man went
crawling through the back.

02:25.267 --> 02:28.268
Pretty busted up.

02:28.270 --> 02:30.404
You get him out of here.
I don't want trouble.

02:43.242 --> 02:44.608
Sir, what happened?

02:44.610 --> 02:45.876
Just fix me up.

02:45.878 --> 02:48.111
All right, let's see.

02:48.113 --> 02:50.413
Gunshot wound.

02:50.415 --> 02:51.681
Okay, I'm gonna wrap up the leg.

02:51.683 --> 02:52.916
You get the stretcher and call dispatch.

02:52.918 --> 02:53.917
Let 'em know this is a crime scene.

02:53.919 --> 02:55.519
- You got it.
- Oh, God.

02:55.521 --> 02:56.520
Oh, oh.

02:56.522 --> 02:58.421
Ambulance 61, we got a GSW

02:58.423 --> 03:00.657
at 128 South Pulaski.

03:00.659 --> 03:02.559
Copy that, Ambo 61.

03:02.561 --> 03:05.595
Easy.

03:07.633 --> 03:11.635
No, no, no, no.

03:17.142 --> 03:19.309
Give me your ID.

03:19.311 --> 03:21.811
What?

03:21.813 --> 03:24.047
Give me your ID!

03:30.155 --> 03:33.557
Not a word, Sylvie Brett.

03:50.035 --> 03:51.626
- Synced and corrected by chamallow -

03:58.483 --> 04:03.854
Hey, cops are on their way.

04:03.856 --> 04:05.622
What the hell happened here?

04:07.092 --> 04:08.759
He just ran up.

04:08.761 --> 04:09.760
Who?

04:11.764 --> 04:13.497
Oh, my God.

04:13.499 --> 04:14.564
He's gonna bleed out.

04:14.566 --> 04:15.732
We got to get pressure on the wound.

04:15.734 --> 04:18.469
Sylvie, get the gauze.

04:20.642 --> 04:23.477
Sylvie, the gauze!

04:33.889 --> 04:36.890
We got to get him out of here.

04:49.384 --> 04:52.151
He just arrested.

04:52.153 --> 04:54.420
Come on.

04:56.324 --> 04:58.825
Come on.

04:58.827 --> 05:00.226
Come on.

05:02.624 --> 05:06.192
Dr. Jones, call extension 257.

05:06.494 --> 05:08.627
You need any help?

05:08.629 --> 05:11.063
Mm-mm.

05:11.065 --> 05:13.666
Hey, April. Are the cops here yet?

05:13.668 --> 05:14.900
I haven't seen them.

05:14.902 --> 05:17.570
Yeah, how's our victim doing?

05:17.572 --> 05:19.638
He didn't make it.

05:29.476 --> 05:32.778
He knows where I live.

05:32.780 --> 05:34.213
I know.

05:34.215 --> 05:36.348
What am I gonna do?

05:36.350 --> 05:38.684
The cops'll be here soon.

05:38.686 --> 05:41.053
They'll know what to do.

05:46.660 --> 05:50.262
Buh, buh. Hey.

05:50.444 --> 05:52.878
Are you still willing to be my best man?

05:52.880 --> 05:54.446
What happened to Trudy's brother?

05:54.448 --> 05:55.914
Trudy won't say exactly,

05:55.916 --> 06:00.252
but Logan got put on the no-fly list.

06:00.254 --> 06:02.120
I thought you'd never ask.

06:04.684 --> 06:08.119
"Beloved, I promise with divine assistance

06:08.121 --> 06:14.092
to be unto thee a loving
and faithful spouse."

06:14.494 --> 06:17.428
It's a traditional Quaker vow.

06:17.430 --> 06:18.663
Platt's Quaker?

06:18.665 --> 06:22.600
No, but the Quakers are
a very neutral people,

06:22.602 --> 06:26.337
so I figure, how angry can Trudy get?

06:26.339 --> 06:28.139
Look at me,

06:28.141 --> 06:30.308
already losing my own voice.

06:30.310 --> 06:31.809
Ah, that's how it starts.

06:31.811 --> 06:34.412
Hey, if you need help with
an escape plan, I'm here...

06:34.594 --> 06:35.860
Hey, ignore him.

06:35.862 --> 06:37.695
He's got a cold and sad heart.

06:37.697 --> 06:38.763
Ah.

06:38.765 --> 06:40.765
If I can't even write the vows...

06:40.767 --> 06:42.032
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Hey, hey, hey.

06:42.034 --> 06:44.168
It's gonna be fine, okay?

06:44.170 --> 06:45.603
I mean, between you and me,

06:45.605 --> 06:49.273
I may have cribbed mine from
a re-run of "Fantasy Island."

06:51.927 --> 06:53.961
Hey, Mouch.

06:53.963 --> 06:56.063
Gettin' pumped for the big day?

06:56.065 --> 06:59.366
T-minus about 72 hours.

06:59.368 --> 07:03.303
Am I right?

07:03.348 --> 07:05.180
I mean, whatever.

07:05.181 --> 07:06.952
I am not a big fan

07:06.953 --> 07:08.722
of weddings anyway.

07:08.723 --> 07:11.723
You know, especially since the divorce.

07:13.931 --> 07:15.931
You know what? I'm gonna get some coffee.

07:15.934 --> 07:17.931
Uh, wait, I've been meaning to tell you,

07:17.934 --> 07:19.431
A free spot opened up on the guest list.

07:19.432 --> 07:20.513
I already paid for the plate.

07:20.514 --> 07:22.222
Might as well use it. Want to come?

07:22.223 --> 07:26.055
Well, with such a warm
invitation, how could I say no?

07:26.056 --> 07:27.889
Of course! Yes, of course I'm in.

07:27.892 --> 07:28.888
Oh, great.

07:28.889 --> 07:32.222
Uh, you're at table three

07:32.223 --> 07:34.015
with uh, Trudy's girlfriends

07:34.016 --> 07:35.805
and Severide.

07:35.806 --> 07:37.930
See you there. Don't be late.

07:37.931 --> 07:40.805
Oh, sounds like a wild table.

07:40.806 --> 07:43.472
Better bring your A-game, Severide.

07:43.473 --> 07:45.130
That's all I got.

07:45.151 --> 07:48.651
So breaking and entering is your A-game?

07:55.526 --> 07:59.150
15 calls and 145 new e-mails.

07:59.151 --> 08:00.817
It hasn't even been a day.

08:00.818 --> 08:02.151
People are excited to have someone

08:02.154 --> 08:03.609
To fight for them on the council.

08:03.612 --> 08:06.192
Yeah.

08:06.193 --> 08:12.525
Hey, um, that thing in the "Sun-Times."

08:12.526 --> 08:13.797
Crazy.

08:13.798 --> 08:15.067
Crazy.

08:15.068 --> 08:16.484
We got to make sure
they have your bio right.

08:16.487 --> 08:18.067
You should call them.

08:18.068 --> 08:19.651
Um, I looked through the schedule

08:19.654 --> 08:21.733
and there are a couple
big votes coming up.

08:21.734 --> 08:24.400
Permits for the St. Paddy's Day parade,

08:24.401 --> 08:27.733
a few construction contracts.

08:27.734 --> 08:29.567
I put together some info for you.

08:29.568 --> 08:33.025
Yeah.

08:33.025 --> 08:35.482
I couldn't do it without you.

08:35.484 --> 08:36.525
Well, you're gonna have to.

08:36.529 --> 08:37.900
At least right now,

08:37.900 --> 08:39.068
'cause I got to go check out

08:39.068 --> 08:40.232
some O2 canisters

08:40.234 --> 08:43.900
that my lieutenant keeps nagging me about.

08:43.900 --> 08:46.567
Hmm.

08:46.568 --> 08:48.526
Read up.

08:51.568 --> 08:53.234
The fact that it's taking
them forever to get here

08:53.237 --> 08:55.733
doesn't exactly instill
me with confidence.

08:55.734 --> 08:59.358
There he is.

08:59.359 --> 09:01.400
That's him?

09:01.401 --> 09:02.693
Doesn't look like he's
been out of the academy

09:02.696 --> 09:04.025
for more than a year.

09:04.026 --> 09:05.943
I'm supposed to put my life in his hands?

09:07.943 --> 09:10.233
You could always go to Antonio first.

09:10.234 --> 09:13.192
He would know the best way to protect you.

09:13.787 --> 09:17.056
Yeah, then... that'd be way better.

09:17.398 --> 09:19.698
Let's do it then.

09:24.038 --> 09:26.104
Detective Dawson's unreachable.

09:26.106 --> 09:27.172
You want to leave a message?

09:27.174 --> 09:28.173
Do you know when he'll be back?

09:28.175 --> 09:29.441
Is he on a case?

09:29.443 --> 09:31.677
I am not in the habit of
broadcasting the whereabouts

09:31.679 --> 09:34.046
of CPD intelligence officers.

09:34.048 --> 09:36.515
Okay, I'm sorry. Is Sergeant Platt around?

09:36.517 --> 09:38.016
If Sergeant Platt were here,

09:38.018 --> 09:39.785
I'd be home right now watching "Ellen."

09:39.787 --> 09:41.086
Hey, look.

09:41.153 --> 09:42.653
We are not trying to
give you a hard time here

09:42.655 --> 09:44.988
but this is very urgent.

09:44.990 --> 09:48.659
Now if you have any way
of reaching Antonio...

09:48.661 --> 09:50.561
I'll try his cell.

09:50.663 --> 09:52.462
Ambulance 61,

09:52.464 --> 09:55.666
fire 5960 North Jefferson.

09:55.668 --> 09:57.467
I got his voicemail.

09:57.469 --> 10:00.871
Right. Will you just tell him
to call Sylvie Brett, please?

10:00.873 --> 10:03.640
Thank you.

10:24.479 --> 10:25.611
Truck, give me a primary search.

10:25.613 --> 10:28.181
- Hermann, Mouch, Kidd. With me.
- Copy that.

10:28.183 --> 10:30.183
Okay, 51, let's get a line in there.

10:30.185 --> 10:31.984
Copy that, Chief.

10:35.323 --> 10:39.425
Fire department, call out.

10:39.427 --> 10:43.629
Jeannie.

10:43.631 --> 10:46.232
- Jeannie!
- Mouch, get him out of here.

10:46.534 --> 10:48.734
Come on, buddy. Let's get you out of here.

10:48.736 --> 10:49.802
I think my friend's still in here.

10:49.804 --> 10:51.437
Don't worry. We'll get him.

10:51.439 --> 10:53.005
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:53.007 --> 10:55.675
Take it easy.

10:55.677 --> 10:58.778
- You all right?
- Yeah.

11:04.652 --> 11:07.653
Fire department, call out.

11:14.595 --> 11:17.596
Fire's inside the wall.
Probably electrical.

11:20.535 --> 11:23.569
Lieutenant!

11:26.140 --> 11:27.973
Help! We're in here.

11:28.335 --> 11:30.602
- Get us out!
- Help!

11:30.604 --> 11:33.372
Somebody's inside.

11:34.375 --> 11:35.507
Hurry!

11:37.578 --> 11:40.078
It's locked.

11:46.683 --> 11:48.416
Easy. Easy. We got you.

11:48.418 --> 11:50.551
Come on.

11:50.553 --> 11:51.653
How many left inside?

11:51.655 --> 11:52.720
I don't know.

11:52.722 --> 11:54.088
They're inside an old bank vault.

11:54.090 --> 11:55.323
We need to figure out a way in.

11:55.325 --> 11:56.591
That's the wine bar.

11:56.593 --> 11:58.326
The door's never supposed
to be closed, ever.

11:58.328 --> 11:59.594
Thank you.

11:59.796 --> 12:01.996
Can you get into a vault door?

12:01.998 --> 12:03.798
We can try. What's it look like?

12:03.800 --> 12:06.100
Old, rectangular-style.
Pretty thick steel.

12:06.102 --> 12:07.368
External hinges?

12:07.370 --> 12:09.036
I think so.

12:09.038 --> 12:10.204
Cruz, K-12, come with me.

12:10.206 --> 12:12.106
On it.

12:15.945 --> 12:18.212
Hey, this way.

12:23.520 --> 12:25.586
We don't have a lot of time.

12:25.588 --> 12:27.955
Give me the saw.

12:30.560 --> 12:31.559
You're good!

12:37.630 --> 12:39.663
Severide, give me an update.

12:39.665 --> 12:41.365
Making progress, Chief,

12:41.367 --> 12:44.168
but the walls are going up fast.

12:53.312 --> 12:55.045
Okay, 81.

12:55.047 --> 12:56.881
Get another saw in there, just in case.

12:56.883 --> 12:58.149
Copy that.

12:58.151 --> 12:59.550
- Get it.
- Got it.

13:10.196 --> 13:11.895
Severide, get out of there.

13:11.897 --> 13:15.566
He's almost through.

13:15.568 --> 13:18.202
Cruz.

13:18.204 --> 13:21.238
Get ready.

13:26.312 --> 13:27.711
Son of a bitch!

13:27.713 --> 13:30.314
Go, go!

13:30.716 --> 13:32.082
Kidd, get him out of here.

13:38.824 --> 13:40.957
Okay, let's get out of here!

13:40.959 --> 13:43.860
All right, let's go.

13:51.997 --> 13:53.363
What the hell happened, Jeannie?

13:53.365 --> 13:56.032
The fire was coming at us and
I just pulled the door shut.

13:56.034 --> 13:58.168
I wasn't even thinking.

14:02.774 --> 14:06.276
It's barely a sunburn. It's no big deal.

14:06.278 --> 14:09.245
- I thought I had more time.
- Uh-huh.

14:09.247 --> 14:11.147
Those walls went up crazy fast, Chief.

14:11.449 --> 14:13.616
Hey, we're taking some smoke
inhalation victims to Med.

14:13.618 --> 14:15.184
You should come and get that checked out.

14:15.186 --> 14:18.020
I'll live.

14:18.022 --> 14:21.190
Okay. Have it your way.

14:24.629 --> 14:26.062
Flames shouldn't have spread that fast.

14:26.064 --> 14:27.697
What the hell were
those walls made out of?

14:27.999 --> 14:31.133
Napalm?

14:40.311 --> 14:42.445
It's not even my birthday yet.

14:42.447 --> 14:44.280
Polystyrene insulation.

14:44.282 --> 14:46.081
Found that during overhaul.

14:46.083 --> 14:48.117
It's why the hallway went up so fast.

14:48.119 --> 14:49.952
I still don't get how that stuff is legal.

14:49.954 --> 14:51.821
City's been trying to ban it for years.

14:52.123 --> 14:56.158
Any decent contractor would
have used rock wool, fiberglass.

14:56.160 --> 14:59.628
Unless they're trying to save a buck.

15:05.239 --> 15:07.205
Everything all right?

15:07.207 --> 15:10.108
I got socked in the eye that last call.

15:10.110 --> 15:11.343
Think it might have aggravated

15:11.345 --> 15:14.079
the corneal abrasion I had last year.

15:14.171 --> 15:16.304
Where?

15:16.306 --> 15:17.672
It's red. Right there.

15:17.674 --> 15:20.609
Vision's a little blurry too.

15:20.871 --> 15:23.438
Ugh, talk about bad timing.

15:23.440 --> 15:27.275
Wedding's supposed to be in two days.

15:27.277 --> 15:29.411
Maybe I just push it.

15:29.413 --> 15:30.845
What's a couple months?

15:30.847 --> 15:32.180
Push the wedding?

15:32.182 --> 15:35.483
Yeah, summer's better for
weddings anyway, right?

15:35.485 --> 15:39.754
Why rush into things?

15:39.756 --> 15:43.858
Mouch, I don't see a damn
thing wrong with your eye.

15:46.330 --> 15:48.963
Yeah.

15:48.965 --> 15:52.033
I'll just put some ice on it.

15:52.035 --> 15:54.903
Should heal up fine.

16:01.501 --> 16:03.568
Hey. Listen to this.

16:03.570 --> 16:06.137
That Wine Bar was renovated
by Gallo Construction,

16:06.139 --> 16:08.740
who happens to be bidding
on a big city contract

16:08.742 --> 16:12.710
which happens to be one of the
first measures I'm voting on.

16:12.712 --> 16:14.212
Small world, Chicago.

16:14.214 --> 16:15.346
What I'm saying is,

16:15.348 --> 16:18.850
I can stop them from
landing that contract.

16:18.852 --> 16:20.318
With your one vote?

16:20.320 --> 16:21.719
Yeah.

16:21.811 --> 16:23.144
Plus, I'll stand up at the meeting

16:23.146 --> 16:26.447
and say something
persuasive, inspirational.

16:26.449 --> 16:27.982
Go get 'em, tiger.

16:28.344 --> 16:30.344
Yeah, oh, ye of little faith.

16:30.346 --> 16:33.481
It's not you. Just...

16:33.483 --> 16:36.117
Never seems to shake
out for the little guy,

16:36.119 --> 16:38.786
the politics game.

16:38.788 --> 16:40.554
But hey, if you can take
this company down on your own,

16:40.556 --> 16:42.924
by all means, go for it.

16:43.286 --> 16:45.119
I plan to.

16:45.121 --> 16:48.789
It shouldn't have happened.

16:49.925 --> 16:51.458
Are you ready?

16:51.460 --> 16:53.460
Yeah, let's get out of here.

16:53.722 --> 16:55.522
Hey, that cop ever catch up with you guys

16:55.524 --> 16:57.124
about the gunshot victim?

16:57.126 --> 16:58.559
He said he needed to get a statement.

16:58.561 --> 17:01.828
I think he left a number somewhere.

17:01.830 --> 17:03.297
We need to talk to Boden.

17:03.299 --> 17:04.698
Yeah, as soon as we get back.

17:04.700 --> 17:07.367
- I'll handle this.
- Okay.

17:41.530 --> 17:43.763
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. What's wrong?

17:47.536 --> 17:48.969
Jimmy, he knows.

17:48.971 --> 17:51.404
He knows we went to the cops.

17:56.233 --> 17:57.500
Hey Dawson?

17:57.502 --> 17:59.167
Have you heard from Antonio today?

17:59.179 --> 18:00.512
Uh, no.

18:00.514 --> 18:01.947
No, why, what's up?

18:02.129 --> 18:04.362
We left word for him
but that was hours ago.

18:04.364 --> 18:06.097
If you have any way of
getting a hold of him,

18:06.099 --> 18:07.799
I could really use his help.

18:07.801 --> 18:10.769
I messed up.

18:11.271 --> 18:13.938
Brett, what's going on?

18:13.940 --> 18:16.707
Chief, I know I should have
said something to you sooner.

18:16.709 --> 18:18.242
Sooner?

18:18.244 --> 18:20.945
You should have called me from the scene.

18:20.947 --> 18:22.446
I would have met you at Med.

18:22.448 --> 18:24.749
Not left your side until I
was sure that you were safe.

18:24.751 --> 18:27.385
Damn it, Brett.

18:27.387 --> 18:29.153
My job is to take care of my people.

18:29.155 --> 18:31.923
How can I do that if they're
not being up front with me?

18:42.769 --> 18:46.170
It's gonna be okay, Brett.

18:46.172 --> 18:48.639
We are gonna figure this out.

18:52.545 --> 18:54.045
Oh, Antonio.

18:54.347 --> 18:55.512
The cop at the hospital.

18:55.514 --> 18:56.747
I've... I've just never seen him before

18:56.749 --> 18:58.682
and I wanted to talk to someone I trust.

18:58.684 --> 19:00.084
I told her to go to you first.

19:00.086 --> 19:02.119
That's... it's on me.

19:02.421 --> 19:05.789
Yeah, and it would have helped
to have a jump in this guy,

19:05.791 --> 19:07.057
but Gabby caught me up.

19:07.059 --> 19:08.659
So, let's get moving now.

19:08.661 --> 19:10.093
Okay.

19:10.095 --> 19:11.495
We IDed your GSW victim.

19:11.497 --> 19:13.630
He's a member of a crew out of Detroit.

19:13.632 --> 19:14.831
They came here to pull a job,

19:14.833 --> 19:16.166
it went sideways somehow,

19:16.168 --> 19:18.168
and now one of them's on a warpath.

19:18.170 --> 19:21.471
There's three crew members dead already.

19:21.473 --> 19:26.009
You recognize any of these guys?

19:26.011 --> 19:28.312
Um...

19:32.151 --> 19:35.919
That's him.

19:35.921 --> 19:37.321
He's the shooter?

19:37.623 --> 19:38.855
The one who threatened you? You sure?

19:38.857 --> 19:41.691
Mm-hmm.

19:41.693 --> 19:43.627
His name's Dale Kjorven.

19:43.629 --> 19:47.163
We need to make sure he never
gets that close to you again.

19:52.971 --> 19:55.705
Hey.

19:55.707 --> 19:58.141
Yes. Can I help?

19:58.143 --> 19:59.976
- Alderman Casey?
- Uh-huh.

19:59.978 --> 20:02.546
Hey. John Gallo.

20:02.548 --> 20:03.947
Gallo Construction.

20:04.229 --> 20:06.396
I just wanted to come
by and introduce myself.

20:06.398 --> 20:07.597
Heard you been asking around.

20:07.599 --> 20:09.833
Thought I may as well
meet the man himself.

20:09.835 --> 20:11.067
Huh.

20:11.199 --> 20:13.499
Yeah, well, I was just calling around,

20:13.501 --> 20:16.669
find out if cheap styrene insulation

20:16.671 --> 20:17.971
is the way you always do business

20:17.973 --> 20:20.873
or just at a place where my
friend nearly lost an arm?

20:20.875 --> 20:23.209
Yeah, okay. Slow down.

20:23.211 --> 20:26.012
Okay, I was as angry as you
are to find out what happened.

20:26.014 --> 20:27.814
No way I would approve work like that.

20:27.816 --> 20:29.248
I mean, you get it.

20:29.250 --> 20:31.617
You were in business for a while
there yourself, weren't you?

20:31.969 --> 20:34.236
- Still am.
- Yeah, well, you understand.

20:34.238 --> 20:37.506
Sub-contractor substitutes crap material,

20:37.508 --> 20:38.908
cheats you out of a couple bucks.

20:38.910 --> 20:40.209
And this sub-contractor,

20:40.211 --> 20:42.778
you plan to use them for the concert hall?

20:42.780 --> 20:45.381
Matt, if you knew me, you'd know.

20:45.383 --> 20:47.083
I do good work.

20:47.085 --> 20:50.353
Except for this one time.

20:50.555 --> 20:51.854
You play golf?

20:51.856 --> 20:53.088
Not much.

20:53.090 --> 20:54.657
All right, you and me, 18
holes down at Ridgemoor.

20:54.659 --> 20:55.758
I don't think that's...

20:55.760 --> 20:57.860
Friday afternoon. I'll set it up.

20:57.862 --> 21:00.763
I'm not taking no for an answer.

21:06.003 --> 21:07.803
Hey.

21:07.805 --> 21:10.205
Kidd and I are gonna
stay with Brett tonight.

21:10.207 --> 21:11.907
Antonio says she'll have
'round the clock protection,

21:11.909 --> 21:13.676
but still.

21:13.678 --> 21:15.844
Glad you'll be there.

21:19.350 --> 21:23.752
45 aldermen voted for
Gallo's last contract.

21:23.754 --> 21:24.853
Isn't that all of them?

21:24.855 --> 21:26.288
All but five.

21:26.290 --> 21:28.657
And he's... he's pretty
tied up with a lot of them.

21:28.659 --> 21:32.294
Donations, fundraisers, stuff like that.

21:32.386 --> 21:36.055
He's got the whole city
council in his pocket.

21:36.057 --> 21:40.959
Yeah, it sounds like it.

21:42.313 --> 21:46.181
Winning this vote, it's a long shot, Matt.

21:46.253 --> 21:50.022
Yeah, but guys like Gallo?

21:50.024 --> 21:51.556
They'll just keep getting
away with things like this

21:51.558 --> 21:55.027
until someone stands up to them.

21:55.029 --> 21:56.395
You gonna take him on?

21:56.397 --> 21:59.197
Hell yeah.

21:59.199 --> 22:01.433
Okay.

22:01.735 --> 22:05.537
Then I'm placing my bet on the long shot.

22:14.338 --> 22:16.071
Hey, I'm giving you a ride.

22:16.073 --> 22:17.472
Oh, um, that's okay.

22:17.474 --> 22:21.343
CPD's got guys watching me 24/7. So...

22:21.345 --> 22:23.645
That's great, but I'm
still giving you a ride.

22:23.647 --> 22:25.013
Really?

22:25.015 --> 22:27.749
Yeah, come on.

22:46.036 --> 22:47.402
You get why "Phantasm"

22:47.404 --> 22:48.836
isn't the first thing on
her mind right now, right?

22:48.838 --> 22:52.373
Dude, "Phantasm" was never gonna happen.

22:52.375 --> 22:54.375
If it wasn't for some
guy trying to kill her,

22:54.377 --> 22:57.979
it would have been something else.

22:57.981 --> 23:02.150
I stated my intentions,
shaved my moustache.

23:02.152 --> 23:04.385
Truth is,

23:04.387 --> 23:07.388
just ain't happening.

23:09.125 --> 23:10.391
Tell you what.

23:10.393 --> 23:13.060
How about we go get a
Blu-ray of "Phantasm,"

23:13.062 --> 23:14.595
12-pack of beer,

23:14.597 --> 23:17.331
head on home and do some
morning drinking, huh?

23:22.171 --> 23:24.672
Hey!

23:24.674 --> 23:26.006
Fellas.

23:26.008 --> 23:27.207
- What's going on?
- Hey.

23:27.309 --> 23:29.476
- Hawks up by two.
- Great. Glad to hear it.

23:29.738 --> 23:33.040
So listen, the wedding's off.

23:34.143 --> 23:36.343
Mouch, what the hell?

23:36.345 --> 23:37.577
You lose your mind?

23:37.579 --> 23:39.279
Came to his senses is all.

23:39.281 --> 23:40.580
No, no, no, no, no.

23:40.582 --> 23:43.483
People are flying in from
as far away as Sheboygan.

23:43.485 --> 23:46.953
I got myself four cases
of bubbly for the bar.

23:46.955 --> 23:48.855
Guys, here's the thing.

23:48.857 --> 23:53.260
Trudy and I have ballroom
dancing on Tuesdays.

23:53.262 --> 23:55.929
Then there's wine tasting
classes on Wednesdays.

23:55.931 --> 23:59.599
Pottery nights, improv
workshops on the weekends.

23:59.601 --> 24:01.201
Finally it hit me.

24:01.203 --> 24:03.470
I can't keep this up the rest of my life.

24:03.532 --> 24:06.299
- You don't have to. Bail.
- Zip it.

24:06.301 --> 24:08.235
I just started thinking,
what's gonna happen

24:08.237 --> 24:10.470
when Trudy realizes who she married

24:10.472 --> 24:13.540
was not the sophisticated,
cultured Randall

24:13.542 --> 24:14.908
she's been seeing this whole time,

24:14.910 --> 24:17.611
but just regular old Mouch

24:17.613 --> 24:22.883
who likes to watch "Junkyard
Wars" and order pizza?

24:23.145 --> 24:24.744
All right. You know, Cindy used to drag me

24:24.746 --> 24:27.247
halfway across Chicago
when we were dating.

24:27.249 --> 24:30.083
I mean, you know, art galleries,

24:30.085 --> 24:31.785
you know, hole-in-the-wall jazz bars.

24:31.787 --> 24:34.254
Awful, awful stuff, all right?

24:34.256 --> 24:36.723
Then we get married, and all of a sudden,

24:36.725 --> 24:39.192
she's, like, perfectly
happy to stay at home,

24:39.194 --> 24:43.930
watch TV, eat stuff on the couch.

24:44.132 --> 24:45.832
That's your pep talk?

24:45.834 --> 24:49.469
So, I ask her, you know, "What gives?"

24:49.471 --> 24:51.704
And she looks at me and she says,

24:51.706 --> 24:55.241
"Babe, why do you think
they call it dating?"

24:55.503 --> 24:58.404
Mouch, I swear to you, six days from now,

24:58.406 --> 25:00.907
you're gonna be wearing sweats,
watching The History Channel,

25:00.909 --> 25:04.076
you know, and eating rocky road.

25:04.358 --> 25:06.125
You promise?

25:06.127 --> 25:08.861
22 years of experience.

25:08.863 --> 25:10.529
That sounds good to you, Mouch?

25:10.531 --> 25:13.465
Rocky road?

25:13.467 --> 25:17.670
Would you prefer ballroom dancing?

25:19.841 --> 25:21.941
Right.

25:33.421 --> 25:34.887
Brett, you want another beer?

25:35.189 --> 25:36.221
No, I'm good, thanks.

25:36.223 --> 25:38.857
What about you, Mrs. Casey?

25:38.859 --> 25:41.994
Ugh, I hope nobody at
headquarters saw that caption.

25:41.996 --> 25:44.229
They'd kick us off
Truck for being a couple.

25:44.231 --> 25:46.832
That why you two haven't tied the knot?

25:46.834 --> 25:48.500
Yeah.

25:48.502 --> 25:51.170
But the truth is,

25:51.172 --> 25:53.839
I like things the way they are.

25:53.841 --> 25:56.475
I'm happier than I've been in a long time.

25:56.477 --> 25:58.177
- That's great.
- See?

25:58.459 --> 26:00.358
Being single's the only way to live.

26:00.360 --> 26:04.129
Uh, that's not exactly what I said.

26:04.131 --> 26:05.630
But it's exactly what you meant.

26:05.632 --> 26:07.332
- No, it isn't.
- All right, fine.

26:07.334 --> 26:09.034
You know what, how about

26:09.036 --> 26:11.169
we call up a couple guys,

26:11.171 --> 26:13.305
put together a nice little
game of Spin the Bottle?

26:13.567 --> 26:17.402
- Spin the Bottle.
- You regress in the winter?

26:18.739 --> 26:20.205
You know, I don't know what that means.

26:20.207 --> 26:21.473
If you're gonna play
anything, you should be playing

26:21.475 --> 26:22.841
Seven Minutes of Heaven,
not Spin the Bottle.

26:22.843 --> 26:24.075
Spin the Bottle's dumb now.

26:24.077 --> 26:26.111
First of all, let's go back. Regress?

26:26.113 --> 26:27.445
No, you remember that time?

26:27.447 --> 26:30.648
You remember the last time
we played Spin the Bottle?

26:30.650 --> 26:32.083
Hello?

26:32.085 --> 26:34.919
The cops can't watch you
forever, Sylvie Brett.

26:34.921 --> 26:37.655
Come all out and be
like, "Hey, I'm ready."

26:37.657 --> 26:39.224
Hey.

26:39.226 --> 26:42.594
Hey, who is it?

26:47.601 --> 26:49.769
Will you let me know if
the situation changes?

26:49.771 --> 26:54.607
Yeah. Thank you.

26:54.609 --> 26:57.043
They tracked the call to
an unregistered cell phone,

26:57.045 --> 26:59.346
but then it went dark.

26:59.348 --> 27:03.616
So far they have no other
leads on this Kjorven guy.

27:03.618 --> 27:06.586
I'm going to need you
to do a shift with Jimmy.

27:06.588 --> 27:08.989
- Got it.
- Cool.

27:08.991 --> 27:10.223
No, no, not cool.

27:10.345 --> 27:11.778
Chief, I appreciate your concern,

27:11.780 --> 27:14.547
but I don't want to let this
guy stop me from doing my job.

27:14.549 --> 27:15.548
It is not your decision.

27:15.550 --> 27:16.583
I can't have you out on calls

27:16.585 --> 27:18.084
until this threat is neutralized.

27:18.086 --> 27:21.287
- Chief...
- Please, do not argue with me.

27:24.693 --> 27:26.593
Thank you. That's all.

27:32.801 --> 27:35.301
Chief, is this about me
not coming to you first...

27:35.303 --> 27:37.804
I am not punishing you, Brett.

27:39.774 --> 27:42.208
I'm taking care of you.

27:51.719 --> 27:53.186
- Hey.
- Hi.

27:53.188 --> 27:54.754
Uh, about Mouch's wedding.

27:54.756 --> 27:56.989
It occurred to me that you're
probably bringing Grant.

27:56.991 --> 27:57.957
Uh...

27:57.959 --> 27:59.091
Your business, but last time I saw him,

27:59.093 --> 28:01.093
he was coming at me with a banjo,

28:01.095 --> 28:04.964
so I think it might be
best if I changed tables.

28:05.066 --> 28:06.866
Yeah, well um, actually,

28:06.868 --> 28:08.935
it was a mandolin,

28:08.937 --> 28:11.571
but no, not bringing Grant.

28:11.573 --> 28:13.940
Finally made a clean break.

28:14.242 --> 28:16.408
Oh, good.

28:16.410 --> 28:17.877
To know.

28:17.879 --> 28:18.878
Yeah.

28:18.950 --> 28:22.484
So uh, we should be good.

28:22.486 --> 28:25.254
I mean, unless any of your
exes are gonna be at the table.

28:25.256 --> 28:26.722
Is that a problem for you?

28:26.724 --> 28:27.990
Well, no, not a problem for me.

28:27.992 --> 28:30.059
More of a problem for you, really, see,

28:30.061 --> 28:32.928
because I'm gonna be looking good,

28:32.930 --> 28:34.363
and the last thing that I need

28:34.365 --> 28:37.633
is some jealous hussy
reading into things wrong,

28:37.635 --> 28:39.702
causing a scene.

28:41.706 --> 28:44.840
Guess I'd better take a
closer look at the guest list.

28:44.842 --> 28:46.909
Guess you better.

28:50.171 --> 28:53.806
Fine, but we shouldn't reward
him for it with a city contract.

28:53.808 --> 28:56.241
Sure, and I realize he has a
lot of support on the council,

28:56.243 --> 28:59.711
but if enough of us are willing
to stand up to him, we...

28:59.713 --> 29:02.214
Yes, just give it some thought, Gene.

29:02.216 --> 29:04.683
That's all I'm asking.

29:04.685 --> 29:07.152
Thank you.

29:07.154 --> 29:08.287
Ugh.

29:08.374 --> 29:11.074
So glad you talked me into this.

29:11.256 --> 29:14.524
You're doing great.

29:14.526 --> 29:15.625
Good morning. This is Matt Casey.

29:15.627 --> 29:19.129
I'm looking for an Alderman Dooley.

29:19.131 --> 29:21.264
So when the alarm comes
in, you just tap right there

29:21.266 --> 29:22.766
and that lets the alarm office know

29:22.768 --> 29:24.868
that the company is responding.
It's pretty straightforward.

29:24.870 --> 29:28.638
And pretty boring, so
try not to fall asleep.

29:28.820 --> 29:30.887
Well, I don't think I'll ever sleep again,

29:30.889 --> 29:33.957
so it shouldn't be a problem.

29:33.959 --> 29:35.358
Hey.

29:35.360 --> 29:38.395
Sooner or later, this
guy's gonna come up for air,

29:38.397 --> 29:40.096
and the cops'll be there.

29:40.398 --> 29:43.800
Yeah. Thanks for having my back.

29:43.802 --> 29:46.169
The whole house does.

29:50.108 --> 29:51.975
- Well...
- Ambulance 61.

29:51.977 --> 29:53.443
Person in distress. Okay, I got this.

29:53.445 --> 29:54.911
- 4420 South Western Boulevard.
- There you go.

29:54.913 --> 29:56.846
Well played.

30:29.447 --> 30:30.446
Gunshot wound to the abdomen.

30:30.448 --> 30:33.349
Give me some pads.

30:33.351 --> 30:34.483
How'd it go down?

30:34.485 --> 30:36.118
Suspect matched an investigative alert

30:36.120 --> 30:37.620
so the officers pulled him over.

30:37.622 --> 30:39.222
He drew a weapon, started shooting.

30:39.224 --> 30:40.223
They returned fire and...

30:40.225 --> 30:42.191
Hey, slow your breathing, okay?

30:42.393 --> 30:44.760
Easy breaths.

30:50.535 --> 30:53.636
Dawson, that's him.

30:54.572 --> 30:56.138
What? What's him?

30:56.140 --> 30:58.107
It's Brett's ID.

31:02.313 --> 31:04.847
Didn't work, did it?

31:04.849 --> 31:09.385
I'll take that. Evidence.

31:09.387 --> 31:10.619
It sounds clear.

31:10.621 --> 31:16.325
I don't know why he's not breathing.

31:16.327 --> 31:17.793
No blood pressure.

31:17.795 --> 31:19.128
There's got to be blockage.

31:19.390 --> 31:22.658
Maybe it's an embolism. Let's intubate.

31:31.659 --> 31:33.926
He's asystole. Push an epi.

31:39.133 --> 31:42.434
Dawson?

31:42.436 --> 31:43.702
Another gunshot wound?

31:43.704 --> 31:48.574
Yeah.

31:48.576 --> 31:50.108
It's crepitus.

31:50.195 --> 31:53.096
Skull's fractured.

31:58.304 --> 32:02.773
No pulse.

32:02.775 --> 32:04.508
Call Chicago Med.

32:04.770 --> 32:08.238
Request a termination in the field.

32:08.240 --> 32:10.340
There's nothing more we can do.

32:31.033 --> 32:32.699
You ready?

32:32.701 --> 32:34.668
Mm-hmm.

32:46.949 --> 32:48.982
That's him.

32:53.389 --> 32:56.923
Hell of a thing.

32:56.925 --> 32:58.959
Yes, it is.

33:06.168 --> 33:08.101
Hey.

33:08.383 --> 33:11.651
It's over.

33:11.853 --> 33:14.354
Was he responsive when you got here?

33:14.356 --> 33:16.556
Yeah, but not for long.

33:16.558 --> 33:19.058
He had a head wound that
we didn't see at first.

33:19.060 --> 33:22.762
There was nothing we could do.

33:22.944 --> 33:27.880
It felt wrong giving it
our all for a guy like that.

33:27.882 --> 33:30.583
Yeah, I don't know if I would have.

33:40.054 --> 33:41.053
- Oh, hey, excuse me a sec.
- Sure.

33:41.055 --> 33:44.990
Thanks. Alderman Casey.

33:44.992 --> 33:46.759
Good effort in there.

33:46.761 --> 33:49.328
I appreciate a big swing.

33:49.330 --> 33:51.130
Yeah. Sure.

33:51.132 --> 33:52.998
Listen, I meant what I said.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.900
You ought to come to the club sometime.

33:54.902 --> 33:58.370
You never know. Maybe I can actually help.

33:58.372 --> 34:02.207
And why would I want your help?

34:02.209 --> 34:03.342
I just told the whole council

34:03.344 --> 34:06.578
I think you're a crook and a liar.

34:06.880 --> 34:10.148
A term is a long time, Matt.

34:10.150 --> 34:13.918
We ought to find a way to work together.

34:13.920 --> 34:16.021
Great try out there tonight.

34:24.398 --> 34:26.931
Hey.

34:26.933 --> 34:27.899
You look great.

34:27.900 --> 34:31.168
Thank you. How did it go?

34:31.170 --> 34:34.105
My first vote, my first loss.

34:34.107 --> 34:36.274
Pretty resounding defeat.

34:36.275 --> 34:38.676
I'm sorry, baby.

34:38.978 --> 34:42.647
That... that... little heavy
on the pours there, pal.

34:44.818 --> 34:47.585
Hey, there he is. The man of the hour.

34:47.587 --> 34:49.320
I'm glad you showed.

34:49.322 --> 34:50.455
Oh, are you kidding?

34:50.456 --> 34:52.023
Thanks again for getting my head straight.

34:56.795 --> 34:58.096
Thank you.

34:58.398 --> 35:00.865
To my best man

35:00.867 --> 35:03.434
and the best day of my life.

35:10.076 --> 35:11.542
I ca... I can't do this.

35:11.544 --> 35:14.645
- Trudy, yes you can.
- Take a deep breath.

35:14.947 --> 35:17.915
One of our first dates
was in a hot air balloon.

35:17.917 --> 35:19.416
Randall loved it.

35:19.418 --> 35:22.052
Said it was everything he'd
been missing in his life.

35:22.054 --> 35:24.288
I almost threw up in that thing.

35:24.290 --> 35:25.956
Twice.

35:26.043 --> 35:28.677
Ever since then it has been non-stop.

35:28.679 --> 35:31.146
Cooking classes, wine tasting,

35:31.148 --> 35:33.682
macramé, square dancing classes.

35:33.944 --> 35:35.677
I'm exhausted.

35:35.679 --> 35:36.912
Trudy.

35:36.914 --> 35:38.113
Tru... Trudy.

35:38.115 --> 35:41.283
Hey. Get it together, okay?

35:41.285 --> 35:42.317
When Mouch said it was everything

35:42.319 --> 35:43.385
he'd been missing in his life,

35:43.387 --> 35:45.153
he didn't mean the hot air balloon.

35:45.155 --> 35:48.790
He meant you.

35:48.792 --> 35:50.058
Do you really think so?

35:50.060 --> 35:53.261
I do.

35:53.323 --> 35:55.423
Look, I've known Mouch a really long time,

35:55.425 --> 35:59.795
and I have never seen him happier.

36:01.365 --> 36:03.298
I do... I love him.

36:03.300 --> 36:06.034
Okay, I'm doing this.

36:06.036 --> 36:08.069
I am pulling this off, right?

36:08.071 --> 36:10.172
- Absolutely.
- Gorgeous.

36:10.174 --> 36:11.606
I can't stand these things.

36:11.608 --> 36:13.041
They make me sweat.

36:13.043 --> 36:14.676
Who invented these things?

36:14.678 --> 36:15.977
You can wear them.

36:15.979 --> 36:17.479
Okay, give me the bouquet.

36:17.781 --> 36:19.948
I don't know why I'm even
talking to you two anyway.

36:19.950 --> 36:22.350
You can't even lock down a man.

37:05.982 --> 37:07.248
Excuse me.

37:07.250 --> 37:10.017
You don't happen to have
Tovaritch Vodka, do you?

37:10.019 --> 37:12.753
No. Sorry.

37:13.045 --> 37:15.212
How do you know about Tovaritch?

37:15.214 --> 37:18.515
I got a taste for it
when I lived in Russia.

37:18.517 --> 37:19.983
What were you doing there?

37:19.985 --> 37:22.519
I got my masters in Russian Literature

37:22.521 --> 37:26.056
at the State University in St. Petersburg.

37:26.058 --> 37:27.257
You're kidding.

37:27.259 --> 37:29.059
My family's from Chernyshevskaya Prospekt.

37:29.061 --> 37:32.162
My grandmother's from the Petrograd side.

37:37.376 --> 37:39.009
You lied.

37:39.011 --> 37:41.611
Yeah, well, it's my personal stock.

37:41.613 --> 37:42.746
For Russians only.

37:54.126 --> 37:56.159
I like your moustache.

38:00.265 --> 38:01.665
Oh.

38:06.305 --> 38:10.807
Oh!

38:11.109 --> 38:12.509
- I don't either.
- It makes no sense.

38:12.511 --> 38:13.777
Okay, look, we're going to find out

38:13.779 --> 38:15.145
the real story sometime.

38:15.147 --> 38:19.382
Yeah, you might as well be
the one to spill the beans.

38:19.384 --> 38:20.683
Fine, I'll let you do the honors.

38:20.685 --> 38:21.985
Oh.

38:22.377 --> 38:24.076
Okay, all right, I would be happy

38:24.078 --> 38:25.978
to be the one to tell the tale.

38:25.980 --> 38:29.415
Okay. So, late one night,

38:29.417 --> 38:33.152
I'm coming back from a tactical
training course at the academy.

38:33.154 --> 38:36.289
The moon was bright as
hell that night, I remember.

38:36.291 --> 38:37.757
I unlock my door

38:37.759 --> 38:43.029
and I hear this sound
coming from the roof.

38:43.331 --> 38:44.964
So I look up,

38:44.966 --> 38:47.566
and then suddenly,

38:47.568 --> 38:48.767
there's Severide

38:48.769 --> 38:52.571
rappelling down from my skylight

38:52.573 --> 38:55.341
singing Sinatra's "This Love of Mine"

38:55.343 --> 38:58.177
with a rose in his mouth.

38:58.179 --> 39:01.113
He'd been mooning over me for weeks.

39:01.115 --> 39:02.681
Poor guy was so blinded by love

39:02.683 --> 39:04.717
he didn't know what he was doing.
