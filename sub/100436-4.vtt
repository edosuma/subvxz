WEBVTT

00:04.613 --> 00:06.484
- Jake, will you join me
in Terry's office?

00:06.528 --> 00:08.530
- Oh, private rendezvous, huh?

00:08.573 --> 00:09.748
This whole trying
to make a baby thing

00:09.792 --> 00:12.142
has got you super freak--
hey, Terry!

00:12.186 --> 00:13.578
What's up, dude?
- What did you think

00:13.622 --> 00:15.145
was happening?
- He clearly thought

00:15.189 --> 00:16.668
you were gonna
have secret sex in here.

00:16.712 --> 00:18.801
-  What?
Inappropes, much?

00:18.844 --> 00:21.064
I did not think that.
Amy did.

00:21.108 --> 00:22.413
She texted me about it.
See? Proof.

00:22.457 --> 00:24.328
Anyway, what's up, Lieutenant?
- Santiago and I

00:24.372 --> 00:26.417
are going to
an administration workshop

00:26.461 --> 00:28.332
for the NYPD.
- And it's voluntary,

00:28.376 --> 00:30.291
so only the cool kids
are gonna be there.

00:30.334 --> 00:31.509
- I love you so much.
Continue.

00:31.553 --> 00:33.337
- Anyways, you're in charge
for the day.

00:33.381 --> 00:34.817
- Oh, boy.
Here comes the lecture.

00:34.860 --> 00:37.124
"Be responsible, Jake. Don't
do anything crazy or fun."

00:37.167 --> 00:39.082
- There's no lecture.
I trust you.

00:39.126 --> 00:40.649
- Well, but there always
used to be a lecture.

00:40.692 --> 00:42.216
- Yeah, well,
you're not the same

00:42.259 --> 00:44.522
immature, rebellious kid
you used to be.

00:44.566 --> 00:46.089
Didn't you and Amy buy

00:46.133 --> 00:47.699
a family-friendly
midsize sedan?

00:47.743 --> 00:50.180
- In a rebellious color--
champagne--which is an alcohol.

00:50.224 --> 00:51.747
And let's not forget,
I wanted to have sex

00:51.790 --> 00:53.140
in your office just now.

00:53.183 --> 00:54.402
- Yeah, to have a baby
and become a father!

00:54.445 --> 00:55.577
- Yeah, he turned it around
on me.

00:55.620 --> 00:57.753
- It's not bad
that I trust you more now.

00:57.796 --> 00:59.233
Plus, there's not even
that much

00:59.276 --> 01:00.538
for you guys to do today.

01:00.582 --> 01:02.714
I mean, the squad is on
reserve parade duty.

01:02.758 --> 01:04.368
Your job is to sit around.
- Good point.

01:04.412 --> 01:05.587
Besides, what's the worst thing

01:05.630 --> 01:07.545
a responsible guy like me
could do?

01:07.589 --> 01:09.286
Buckle your butts, everyone!

01:09.330 --> 01:11.114
The Jimmy Jab Games
are back!

01:31.439 --> 01:33.528
Squad, today we write
a new chapter

01:33.571 --> 01:34.833
in the history
of the Nine-Nine.

01:34.877 --> 01:36.487
And that chapter begins with
the word "Jimmy,"

01:36.531 --> 01:37.749
and ends with the word "Jab."

01:37.793 --> 01:39.142
- That chapter's only
two words long.

01:39.186 --> 01:40.491
- No, there's a lot of words
in between.

01:40.535 --> 01:41.753
It's a long chapter.
The point is,

01:41.797 --> 01:43.320
today we compete against
one another

01:43.364 --> 01:44.408
in a series of games,

01:44.452 --> 01:45.453
and this year's winner

01:45.496 --> 01:48.369
receives one day's
paid vacation,

01:48.412 --> 01:49.848
courtesy of Officer Mark.

01:49.892 --> 01:51.720
- You said you needed that day
for a private matter.

01:51.763 --> 01:53.113
- You know what?
You shouldn't even be here.

01:53.156 --> 01:54.549
Everyone say,
"Thank you, Officer Mark.

01:54.592 --> 01:56.203
Bye, Officer Mark."
all: Thank you, Officer Mark.

01:56.246 --> 01:57.508
Bye, Officer Mark.

01:57.552 --> 01:59.771
- Now, who's ready to compete?
- Count me in.

01:59.815 --> 02:00.772
I could really use this day off

02:00.816 --> 02:02.513
to spend some time
with my husband.

02:02.557 --> 02:04.036
- Oh, please.
We all have loved ones.

02:04.080 --> 02:05.429
You're not getting any sympathy
just because you're gay.

02:05.473 --> 02:06.648
- Rosa, I don't think he was--

02:06.691 --> 02:08.563
- No, I was.
She saw right through me.

02:08.606 --> 02:12.523
Nevertheless,
I will destroy you all.

02:12.567 --> 02:13.785
- Copy that.
I love your intensity.

02:13.829 --> 02:15.613
Now, Gina is gone,
so we're out of a host.

02:15.657 --> 02:16.788
- Me! Please, me.

02:16.832 --> 02:18.181
It's my time to shine.

02:18.225 --> 02:19.443
It's my "Greatest Showman"
moment.

02:19.487 --> 02:20.705
- Charles, you can't.

02:20.749 --> 02:22.272
- You know who else
they told "You can't"?

02:22.316 --> 02:23.882
Lettie Lutz, the bearded lady.

02:23.926 --> 02:26.798
But then,
Mr. Barnum gave her a stage.

02:26.842 --> 02:28.191
Give me my stage, Jacob.

02:28.235 --> 02:29.584
- Wait, so you're
the bearded lady?

02:29.627 --> 02:32.239
- No! I'm Barnum,
you're Zac Efron,

02:32.282 --> 02:33.631
and everyone else
is one of my freaks.

02:33.675 --> 02:35.198
- Look, I would love
to give you the hosting duties

02:35.242 --> 02:37.287
so you can work through
whatever weird fantasy this is,

02:37.331 --> 02:38.636
but we need
at least six players

02:38.680 --> 02:39.811
and the host can't play.

02:39.855 --> 02:41.378
- Then I'll find someone
to replace me.

02:41.422 --> 02:43.946
I promise you will have
your circus, Mr. Barnum.

02:43.989 --> 02:45.469
- I thought you were Barnum.
- No!

02:45.513 --> 02:47.384
I'm the greatest showman!

02:48.733 --> 02:50.213
- Isn't that Barnum?

02:50.257 --> 02:52.563
- Debbie, ah,
just who I was looking for.

02:52.607 --> 02:54.783
- Oh, no. Am I in your seat?
I'll sit on the floor.

02:54.826 --> 02:56.872
- Wh-what? No.
No, don't do that.

02:56.915 --> 02:58.352
No, I was just wondering

02:58.395 --> 02:59.918
if you would like
to take my place

02:59.962 --> 03:01.529
in a little
squad competition today.

03:01.572 --> 03:04.706
- Mm. I can't do competitions.
I'm anti-dexterous.

03:04.749 --> 03:06.316
- Hmm?
- It's when neither hand

03:06.360 --> 03:09.667
is good at anything.
- Oh, Debbie.

03:09.711 --> 03:11.234
I was once like you.

03:11.278 --> 03:13.889
A bashful beat cop
with long, curly hair

03:13.932 --> 03:15.412
and no confidence at all.

03:15.456 --> 03:18.328
- That's impossible.
You're so suave.

03:18.372 --> 03:19.547
- Sure, now I am.

03:19.590 --> 03:21.505
But I came a long way,

03:21.549 --> 03:23.681
and I did it
by challenging myself

03:23.725 --> 03:25.814
to do things
I never thought I could.

03:25.857 --> 03:27.990
This is your chance
to find that confidence.

03:28.033 --> 03:30.601
- I don't know.
- Debbie...

03:30.645 --> 03:32.342
trust me.

03:32.386 --> 03:33.691
- Okay.

03:33.735 --> 03:36.868
But only because
I trust everyone.

03:36.912 --> 03:39.567
- So, Diaz,
I've never been more excited.

03:39.610 --> 03:41.438
My first time
playing the Jimmy Jabs,

03:41.482 --> 03:42.657
and I'm destined to win.

03:42.700 --> 03:43.701
Look at my competition.

03:43.745 --> 03:44.920
Little Miss Hay For Brains.

03:44.963 --> 03:46.008
The Hay Brains,

03:46.051 --> 03:48.010
and King Brain Made of Hay.

03:48.053 --> 03:49.403
- Well, you're forgetting
about me.

03:49.446 --> 03:50.795
I'm also your competition.
- Yes,

03:50.839 --> 03:52.449
but you don't normally
care about games like these.

03:52.493 --> 03:54.495
- Well, I do care
about this game.

03:54.538 --> 03:57.367
And you're gonna lose because
my brains aren't made of hay.

03:57.411 --> 04:00.240
My brains are made of brains.

04:00.283 --> 04:01.893
- Oh, ho.

04:01.937 --> 04:03.982
The perfect retort.

04:04.026 --> 04:05.897
- Gather up,
it's Jimmy Jam time!

04:05.941 --> 04:07.812
- Ooh, are you doing
opening ceremonies?

04:07.856 --> 04:09.336
- Yeah, and you might
wanna leave

04:09.379 --> 04:10.685
before things get too crazy.

04:10.728 --> 04:12.469
A little plausible deniability.

04:12.513 --> 04:14.297
- Actually, I wanna record 'em.

04:14.341 --> 04:15.733
May you can
teach other precincts

04:15.777 --> 04:17.387
how to throw their own versions
to boost morale.

04:17.431 --> 04:18.954
- No, I'm not a teacher.

04:18.997 --> 04:20.825
I'm a class clown/bad boy
with a heart of gold. Whatever.

04:20.869 --> 04:22.436
Charles, just start.

04:22.479 --> 04:26.004
- Ladies and gentlemen.

04:26.048 --> 04:27.397
The moment
you've been waiting for.

04:27.441 --> 04:28.920
- Wow, he went full "Showman."

04:28.964 --> 04:31.532
I present to you six freaks,

04:31.575 --> 04:33.621
who, through a series
of elaborate games,

04:33.664 --> 04:35.884
Will be eliminated one by one

04:35.927 --> 04:38.321
until a champion is crowned.

04:38.365 --> 04:40.932
And that champion shall...

04:40.976 --> 04:42.717
inherit my circus.

04:42.760 --> 04:44.414
- And get a day off.
- I was getting there, Ro-Ro.

04:44.458 --> 04:45.676
Let me have my fun.
- Yeah, Ro-Ro,

04:45.720 --> 04:46.677
let him have his fun.

04:46.721 --> 04:49.071
- As always, we start the games

04:49.114 --> 04:52.770
by lighting the ceremonial
bagel of destiny.

04:52.814 --> 04:56.948
- Ah, it's actually
the baguette of destiny

04:56.992 --> 05:00.082
because this year, we're
throwing caution to the wind.

05:00.125 --> 05:02.302
Charles, flame me.

05:02.345 --> 05:04.521
- ♪ Jimmy Jabs
Jimmy Jabs ♪

05:04.565 --> 05:08.438
♪ Jimmy Jabs

05:08.482 --> 05:11.006
- And with that,
we commence...

05:11.049 --> 05:12.790
my ten minute
opening performance.

05:12.834 --> 05:15.358
- What?
- ♪ The crowd is ready

05:15.402 --> 05:17.055
♪ The freaks are here

05:17.099 --> 05:19.493
- Wow, this is
a really long performance.

05:19.536 --> 05:20.972
Charles pulled off
a costume change.

05:21.016 --> 05:22.452
- I wouldn't say
he pulled it off.

05:22.496 --> 05:24.367
He accidentally got bottomless
in front of all of us.

05:24.411 --> 05:25.847
- Yeah.
- Peralta,

05:25.890 --> 05:26.978
how about we make these games
a little more exciting

05:27.022 --> 05:28.763
with a wager?
- Ooh, interesting.

05:28.806 --> 05:30.591
What'd you have in mind?
- If you win,

05:30.634 --> 05:31.853
I'll do your paperwork
for a year.

05:31.896 --> 05:33.898
- Go on.
- If I win, I get your new car.

05:33.942 --> 05:35.073
You're joking, right?

05:35.117 --> 05:36.553
- Why?
Because you can't imagine

05:36.597 --> 05:38.947
someone bitchin' like me
driving a lame family sedan?

05:38.990 --> 05:41.341
- No, because Jake
would never bet our car.

05:41.384 --> 05:42.820
- Yeah, I would never do that.

05:42.864 --> 05:44.344
But also, it's not lame.

05:44.387 --> 05:45.823
It's the color of an alcohol.
Everyone's talking about it.

05:45.867 --> 05:47.608
- No, Jake,
it's a super lame car.

05:47.651 --> 05:48.870
But I don't mind.

05:48.913 --> 05:50.306
My ex-step-son
kicked me out of the house,

05:50.350 --> 05:51.916
and I need a place to crash
with air conditioning.

05:51.960 --> 05:53.483
- Look, the bet
is not happening.

05:53.527 --> 05:55.442
- Sorry, Amy, but this is
between Jake and me.

05:55.485 --> 05:57.139
Dude, what happened
to the cool guy

05:57.182 --> 05:59.576
that liked to make bets
with his best bud?

05:59.620 --> 06:01.099
- Okay, Hitchcock, drop it.

06:01.143 --> 06:03.145
Jake doesn't do
that kind of thing anymore.

06:03.188 --> 06:05.016
He's an adult now.
- Hitchcock, you're on!

06:05.060 --> 06:06.104
- He is?
- I am?

06:06.148 --> 06:08.585
- I don't know. Yes!
Yes, you are.

06:08.629 --> 06:09.934
- Damn it, my pants.

06:09.978 --> 06:12.023
Sorry, everyone.
Look away, look away.

06:12.067 --> 06:13.416
- Oh, damn.

06:13.460 --> 06:14.852
- Wow, who knew?

06:14.896 --> 06:20.031
He really is
the greatest showman.

06:20.292 --> 06:21.946
- What the hell are you doing?

06:21.990 --> 06:22.947
Why did you just bet
our new car?

06:22.991 --> 06:23.948
- Because it's fun.

06:23.992 --> 06:25.210
And because it's who I am.

06:25.254 --> 06:26.690
I mean, remember
all those crazy bets

06:26.734 --> 06:28.170
we used to make when you were
falling in love with me?

06:28.213 --> 06:30.041
- I remember the bets we made
when I found you obnoxious

06:30.085 --> 06:31.565
and difficult to be around.

06:31.608 --> 06:33.001
- Yes, those bets.
See, you remember.

06:33.044 --> 06:34.698
This is just like that.
- Hey, Santiago,

06:34.742 --> 06:35.699
it's time to head out.

06:35.743 --> 06:36.700
- Actually, I'm not leaving.

06:36.744 --> 06:37.875
I'm gonna stay for the games.

06:37.919 --> 06:39.877
- Ohh, look who's coming
around already.

06:39.921 --> 06:41.879
We're gonna have fun.
- No, this isn't fun.

06:41.923 --> 06:44.055
A voluntary
administration workshop is fun.

06:44.099 --> 06:45.100
- Yeah, I hear it ends

06:45.143 --> 06:46.580
with a six page
self-assessment.

06:46.623 --> 06:47.668
- Oh, come on, Terry!

06:47.711 --> 06:48.886
You don't have to rub it in!

06:48.930 --> 06:50.888
- Welcome to
the first competition.

06:50.932 --> 06:54.326
Which one of you
will meet your maker?

06:54.370 --> 06:57.068
Be sure not to foul out,

06:57.112 --> 06:59.288
or you will meet your end.

06:59.331 --> 07:00.289
- We don't know
what the game is,

07:00.332 --> 07:01.377
so these puns don't work.

07:01.421 --> 07:02.987
- It's a meat throwing
challenge.

07:03.031 --> 07:06.338
All of the expired cold cuts
from the kitchen refrigerator

07:06.382 --> 07:08.776
are under this tarp.

07:08.819 --> 07:09.951
Voila!

07:09.994 --> 07:12.562
You will toss
a meat of your choosing

07:12.606 --> 07:16.218
at the break room window
from ten feet away.

07:16.261 --> 07:18.655
If it sticks to the glass,
well, then you move on.

07:18.699 --> 07:20.701
If it doesn't, then you're a--
- Cold cut?

07:20.744 --> 07:22.398
- Yes, now you're getting it.
Thank you, Rosa.

07:23.747 --> 07:25.967
- Yah!
- Jake sticks it.

07:26.010 --> 07:27.751
Amy sticks it.

07:27.795 --> 07:29.187
Scully sticks it.

07:29.231 --> 07:31.668
Hitchcock sticks it.

07:31.712 --> 07:33.757
Holt old school sticks it.

07:33.801 --> 07:34.845
Ro-Ro sticks it.

07:34.889 --> 07:36.934
Debbie--where's Debbie?

07:38.458 --> 07:41.112
- I can't do this, Charles.
I didn't even grab a meat.

07:41.156 --> 07:44.333
I'm not some expert
cold cut thrower like you.

07:44.376 --> 07:47.336
- Everyone, I need a second
for a freak in trouble.

07:47.379 --> 07:49.643
Debbie, I once stood here
in front of this squad

07:49.686 --> 07:51.122
and felt like I didn't belong.
- But--

07:51.166 --> 07:52.428
- But nothing.
This is your chance

07:52.472 --> 07:53.429
to do something great.

07:53.473 --> 07:54.822
Debbie, this is your moment.

07:54.865 --> 07:58.956
Take it, and stick this meat.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.741
- Is this turkey?
- Yes.

08:00.784 --> 08:01.916
I'm very allergic to turkey.

08:03.352 --> 08:05.136
- Hold her down!
- Ahh!

08:06.442 --> 08:07.748
So Debbie's out.

08:07.791 --> 08:09.184
But she'll be fine,
thanks to her purse

08:09.227 --> 08:10.664
full of EpiPens.

08:10.707 --> 08:12.448
And now, that brings us
to the end of round one,

08:12.492 --> 08:16.147
which mean it is time
for another song.

08:16.191 --> 08:18.976
♪ It was the meet
of the moment ♪

08:19.020 --> 08:20.674
♪ Meat, meat, meat
of the moment ♪

08:20.717 --> 08:22.893
- Yeah, we'll be back in five.
- ♪ Throw, throw, throw it

08:22.937 --> 08:24.416
♪ At the window,
window, window ♪

08:24.460 --> 08:26.636
- So I bet you're wondering
how I did so well

08:26.680 --> 08:28.856
in that last competition.
- Actually, I was impressed

08:28.899 --> 08:30.161
you didn't eat any of the meat.

08:30.205 --> 08:31.380
- Well, I don't deserve
all the credit.

08:31.423 --> 08:32.903
Scully, show 'em
what we're working with.

08:32.947 --> 08:36.820
- This is Dorothy,
my pill box.

08:36.864 --> 08:38.343
- Good God.
- My friend here

08:38.387 --> 08:40.084
has dozens
of medications prescribed

08:40.128 --> 08:41.216
for all of his ailments.

08:41.259 --> 08:42.391
They make him normal.

08:42.434 --> 08:44.436
They make me limitless.

08:44.480 --> 08:46.874
- This blood thinner
can suppress appetite.

08:46.917 --> 08:49.703
This eczema pill can cause
extreme muscle spasms.

08:49.746 --> 08:51.008
- Which is pretty inconvenient,

08:51.052 --> 08:52.836
unless you need to hurl meat
across the room.

08:52.880 --> 08:55.273
- My God. He's doping.

08:55.317 --> 08:57.841
- Welcome to the big leagues.

08:57.885 --> 08:59.234
- Well, looks like things

08:59.277 --> 09:00.844
just got
a little more interesting.

09:00.888 --> 09:02.324
- No, they got worse.

09:02.367 --> 09:04.282
- Amy, it's like Torrance
from "Bring It On" says,

09:04.326 --> 09:06.502
"You'll never be the best
until you win against the best.

09:06.546 --> 09:07.982
- Didn't they lose in the end?

09:08.025 --> 09:09.026
- Yeah, but this is different.

09:09.070 --> 09:10.158
Hitchcock isn't nearly as good

09:10.201 --> 09:11.420
as the East Compton Clovers.

09:11.463 --> 09:13.901
It's like,
where's your head at?

09:13.944 --> 09:15.859
It's gonna be fine.
It might not be fine.

09:15.903 --> 09:17.861
- Diaz, congratulations
on moving on

09:17.905 --> 09:21.038
to the second round,
said I, sarcastically.

09:21.082 --> 09:22.300
- Oh, you're still in this.

09:22.344 --> 09:24.520
I knew a uniformed officer
had been eliminated,

09:24.564 --> 09:26.130
I just couldn't remember
which one.

09:26.174 --> 09:28.959
- Okay, we're both great
at insults. Let's move on.

09:29.003 --> 09:31.788
Tell me, why do you wanna
win this game so badly?

09:31.832 --> 09:34.748
- Honestly...
I guess I still feel like

09:34.791 --> 09:37.489
my parents don't accept
my sexuality.

09:37.533 --> 09:39.274
And winning this
will let me prove to myself

09:39.317 --> 09:42.277
that as long as I feel good
about who I am,

09:42.320 --> 09:44.409
that's all that matters.

09:44.453 --> 09:46.063
- That's a load of dung.

09:46.107 --> 09:48.065
You processed that parent stuff
a year ago.

09:48.109 --> 09:50.328
- You're right, we're going
to drag brunch this Sunday.

09:50.372 --> 09:54.985
- No. There's something private
that is fueling you.

09:55.029 --> 09:56.813
And when I find
that private fuel,

09:56.857 --> 09:59.120
I will extract it
to use as my private fuel

09:59.163 --> 10:00.338
in my private fuel tank.

10:00.382 --> 10:03.037
Then I will have a full tank
of private fuel,

10:03.080 --> 10:05.953
and you will have an empty tank
of private--

10:05.996 --> 10:06.997
Rosa.

10:07.041 --> 10:09.870
- Welcome to K-9 Hide-and-Seek.

10:09.913 --> 10:11.436
You'll be given
five minutes to hide,

10:11.480 --> 10:13.264
during which time
Officer Frisbee

10:13.308 --> 10:14.788
will be learning your scent.

10:14.831 --> 10:16.267
Whoever he finds first is out.

10:16.311 --> 10:18.008
- How'd you get our clothes?
- Doesn't matter.

10:18.052 --> 10:19.270
Now, hide, freaks!

10:19.314 --> 10:22.012
Hide from the society
that shunned you!

10:25.189 --> 10:26.930
- What? Why aren't you hiding?
Are you quitting?

10:26.974 --> 10:28.932
- Oh, no, quite the opposite.

10:28.976 --> 10:31.108
This little guy keeps
Scully's liver from imploding,

10:31.152 --> 10:32.457
but it has a neat side effect.

10:32.501 --> 10:34.546
It also masks your natural odor

10:34.590 --> 10:36.374
and makes you smell
like a dead fish.

10:36.418 --> 10:38.289
- Ew.
- Who's got two stinky thumbs

10:38.333 --> 10:40.248
that stink like rotten salmon?

10:40.291 --> 10:41.945
This stinky guy.

10:41.989 --> 10:43.164
- You suck.

10:43.207 --> 10:46.602
- Ready or not,
here comes my hellhound!

11:01.095 --> 11:02.966
- I'm a mop.

11:03.010 --> 11:04.098
Shh.

11:04.141 --> 11:06.535
- The flattop
has left the big top.

11:06.578 --> 11:07.884
Uh, wait, where's Jake?

11:07.928 --> 11:09.016
- Well, there's a TV cart

11:09.059 --> 11:10.321
suspiciously in the middle
of the room,

11:10.365 --> 11:11.801
that ceiling tile's
out of place,

11:11.845 --> 11:13.977
and he said he was going
to hide somewhere reckless,

11:14.021 --> 11:15.979
so I'm guessing he's up there.

11:16.023 --> 11:18.416
- That's right, Amy.
I'm in the ceiling.

11:18.460 --> 11:20.331
Unlike you boring, old fogies,

11:20.375 --> 11:22.856
I found the craziest--

11:25.597 --> 11:27.338
Don't worry.

11:27.382 --> 11:31.647
My bones and ribs
broke my fall.

11:31.908 --> 11:33.475
- Time for
our next competition,

11:33.518 --> 11:35.085
The Hellevator.

11:35.129 --> 11:38.436
You see, normally, our elevator
can hold up to 12 freaks.

11:38.480 --> 11:40.134
But what if it's filled
with boxes,

11:40.177 --> 11:42.092
and those freaks
are wearing bomb suits?

11:42.136 --> 11:44.312
Well then,
its capacity drops to four.

11:44.355 --> 11:47.750
Oh, but Mr. Barnum,
there are five freaks here.

11:47.794 --> 11:49.621
Whatever shall we do?

11:49.665 --> 11:50.753
That's the twist.

11:50.797 --> 11:52.712
You have to
fight for your spot.

11:52.755 --> 11:54.801
And once those
elevator doors close,

11:54.844 --> 11:56.628
one of you will be out.

11:56.672 --> 12:00.545
Oh, did I mention, you have to
do it all in bomb suits?

12:00.589 --> 12:02.330
- Yes, that was one of
the first things you mentioned.

12:02.373 --> 12:04.724
- Oh, sorry.
I was thinking of my next song.

12:04.767 --> 12:07.335
Anyway, suit up, freaks!

12:09.946 --> 12:11.600
- You're pretty hurt, huh?
- Yeah.

12:11.643 --> 12:12.819
It's very exciting.

12:12.862 --> 12:14.472
I'm the underdog now,
like Seabiscuit.

12:14.516 --> 12:15.691
I mean, sure,
I can't lift my arms,

12:15.735 --> 12:18.215
but Seabiscuit won
without even having arms.

12:18.259 --> 12:20.130
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know. I fell.

12:20.174 --> 12:21.305
We're already married.
It doesn't matter.

12:21.349 --> 12:22.567
- Well, you guys are in
for a beating.

12:22.611 --> 12:24.439
- What, is that some kind
of kidney pill?

12:24.482 --> 12:26.180
- It's to reduce
my various swellings.

12:26.223 --> 12:27.398
- Basically, it's just speed.

12:27.442 --> 12:28.922
- That's illegal, and--
- Ack-ack-ack-ack!

12:28.965 --> 12:30.793
- Okay, here we go, everyone.

12:30.837 --> 12:34.318
The game begins
when the elevator doors ding.

12:34.362 --> 12:36.799
Are you ready
for the Hellevator?

12:36.843 --> 12:39.323
- Buckle up.
The juice is loose!

12:40.542 --> 12:43.240
Here we go, Hitchcock!

12:43.284 --> 12:44.459
- What the ?

12:48.289 --> 12:49.725
- Jake, let me in, let me in!

12:49.769 --> 12:51.422
- Amy, I'm not gonna make it!

12:51.466 --> 12:53.250
You just go for the day off.
You've earned it.

12:53.294 --> 12:54.512
- No, we're gonna lose the car!

12:54.556 --> 12:55.775
- Oh, crap! Right, the car.

12:55.818 --> 12:57.211
Oh, no,
we're gonna lose the car!

12:57.254 --> 13:00.692
- Hell no, we won't!

13:00.736 --> 13:02.346
She "Armageddon'd" me.

13:02.390 --> 13:04.392
- I don't know
what that means.

13:06.220 --> 13:08.570
- Another love's sacrifice,

13:08.613 --> 13:10.398
and another lover reborn.

13:10.441 --> 13:12.226
These games truly
have it all.

13:12.269 --> 13:13.967
And now, a quick intermission

13:14.010 --> 13:17.840
for one of my legendary
costume changes.

13:17.884 --> 13:19.189
All right, come on, Charles.

13:19.233 --> 13:21.670
Quick change,
no time for touch-ups.

13:21.713 --> 13:23.803
We're running long.

13:23.846 --> 13:25.761
- Ow!
- Oh, Debbie.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.807
Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm just recovering

13:27.850 --> 13:28.982
from the EpiPen.

13:29.025 --> 13:30.635
I'm sorry
I messed everything up.

13:30.679 --> 13:32.637
I'm just not cut out
for this high-stakes world

13:32.681 --> 13:34.465
of having fun with friends.
- First off,

13:34.509 --> 13:36.598
if you think you messed
this up, you're crazy.

13:36.641 --> 13:37.860
Nothing can mess up
the performance

13:37.904 --> 13:39.079
I'm putting on out there.

13:39.122 --> 13:41.429
Secondly, what you did today
was incredible.

13:41.472 --> 13:44.867
- I got disqualified
immediately.

13:44.911 --> 13:47.827
- Did I ever tell you the story
of my Jimmy Jabs humiliation?

13:47.870 --> 13:50.655
- No. You pretty much
never talked to me till today.

13:50.699 --> 13:54.311
- Well, it was 2009,
it was the opening ceremonies

13:54.355 --> 13:55.747
and I couldn't be more excited.

13:55.791 --> 13:57.706
I even got my hair styled
just for the event.

13:57.749 --> 13:59.969
- Charles, flame me.

14:01.710 --> 14:03.755
I was out before the games
even began.

14:03.799 --> 14:06.628
But I wouldn't change
that moment for the world

14:06.671 --> 14:10.414
because it made me realize
that not even flames

14:10.458 --> 14:12.416
can grind me down to dust.

14:12.460 --> 14:15.767
There is a place for us,
for we are glorious.

14:15.811 --> 14:19.554
- You are the bearded lady.
- We are all the bearded lady.

14:19.597 --> 14:21.861
Now ask yourself what have you
always wanted to do,

14:21.904 --> 14:23.645
but were too scared to try?
- Sing.

14:23.688 --> 14:24.907
- What?
- I wanna sing

14:24.951 --> 14:27.388
in front of everyone.
- Okay, little lady,

14:27.431 --> 14:28.780
you get that voice warmed up

14:28.824 --> 14:31.044
because you are doing
the closing ceremonies.

14:31.087 --> 14:33.655
- I can't. I haven't prepared.

14:33.698 --> 14:35.048
I don't even know the song.

14:35.091 --> 14:37.833
- Welcome to show business.
It waits for no one.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.617
You're on in an hour.

14:39.661 --> 14:42.011
- So Diaz, I figured out
why you wanna win.

14:42.055 --> 14:43.621
I hacked your work calendar.

14:43.665 --> 14:44.709
- Those calendars are public.

14:44.753 --> 14:45.885
Everyone on the system
has access.

14:45.928 --> 14:47.016
- I hacked it.
I'm a hacker.

14:47.060 --> 14:49.627
Anyhow, you took a vacation
14 days ago,

14:49.671 --> 14:52.543
and yet, you already
want another day off?

14:52.587 --> 14:55.938
Odd, unless you need it
for a unique,

14:55.982 --> 14:57.809
once-in-a-lifetime occurrence.

14:57.853 --> 15:01.726
Perhaps a proposal
to your girlfriend Jocelyn.

15:01.770 --> 15:02.945
- What?
- You've been dating

15:02.989 --> 15:04.294
for a year, you've met
each other's parents,

15:04.338 --> 15:06.731
and you just got
your nails done

15:06.775 --> 15:10.605
to present her with a ring.

15:10.648 --> 15:12.650
- Jocelyn broke up with me.
- What?

15:12.694 --> 15:14.043
- I want the day off
so I can sit around

15:14.087 --> 15:15.958
and listen to death metal
and get my head right.

15:16.002 --> 15:18.047
- But what about
my nail polish solve?

15:18.091 --> 15:19.701
- Getting my nails done
made me feel better

15:19.744 --> 15:22.486
for a second.
- Ahh!

15:22.530 --> 15:24.053
This is a trick
to throw me off.

15:24.097 --> 15:26.403
I bet things
are better than ever and you--

15:26.447 --> 15:27.839
Oh.

15:27.883 --> 15:29.972
You really are crying.

15:30.016 --> 15:33.497
- Welcome to my most
sadistic creation.

15:33.541 --> 15:36.500
The tangled nightmare
of extension cords

15:36.544 --> 15:38.024
that lives
in our supply closet.

15:38.067 --> 15:42.506
Your mission is to untangle
your lamp's cord, plug it in,

15:42.550 --> 15:45.640
and then pull yourself to it
on your dolly and turn it on.

15:45.683 --> 15:47.990
- Oh, nice. Hitchcock's
coming down from the speed.

15:48.034 --> 15:49.339
I have a chance.

15:49.383 --> 15:51.515
- Freaks, begin!

15:53.169 --> 15:57.347
- Jake!

15:57.391 --> 15:58.696
- What is that?
- Grab the top one

15:58.740 --> 16:00.394
and yank the bottom one!
- Oh, thank God

16:00.437 --> 16:01.656
that's what she meant.

16:01.699 --> 16:02.918
Although, I'm open
to whatever you wanna try.

16:04.050 --> 16:05.486
- Diaz, I wanna apologize.

16:05.529 --> 16:07.705
- I'm not talking to you.

16:07.749 --> 16:09.664
Oh, oh, Amy, it worked!

16:09.707 --> 16:11.535
The banging worked!
- What? No!

16:11.579 --> 16:13.407
- Here we go.

16:13.450 --> 16:14.712
- Go.

16:18.064 --> 16:19.152
- Gotcha.

16:19.195 --> 16:20.153
- You're never gonna catch me.

16:20.196 --> 16:23.634
Yes, I did it!

16:23.678 --> 16:25.027
And Hitchcock's gonna lose!

16:25.071 --> 16:26.681
Rosa and Holt
are gonna beat him.

16:26.724 --> 16:28.378
- Rosa, stop. I give up.

16:28.422 --> 16:30.467
I want you to know
I'm sorry for prying.

16:30.511 --> 16:32.078
Win this thing,
and enjoy your day off.

16:32.121 --> 16:34.123
And if you ever want
a friend to sit with you

16:34.167 --> 16:36.996
and silently listen
to death metal,

16:37.039 --> 16:40.390
just know I'm always here.

16:40.434 --> 16:43.437
- Okay. I'd like that.

16:43.480 --> 16:45.178
- Ah, no!
What are you freaks doing?

16:45.221 --> 16:46.396
- We're leaving
the competition.

16:46.440 --> 16:48.877
Some things are more important
than a game.

16:48.920 --> 16:50.966
- No, they're not!
Wait, where are you going?

16:51.010 --> 16:53.186
Don't leave!
We need you to--

16:57.799 --> 17:02.064
Why does the ceiling hate me?

17:02.369 --> 17:04.588
- I don't get it.
Why did you make this bet

17:04.632 --> 17:06.068
in the first place?
- I don't know.

17:06.112 --> 17:07.156
Terry kept saying
all that stuff

17:07.200 --> 17:08.462
about how I matured,

17:08.505 --> 17:10.072
and I got worried
I was becoming a boring adult.

17:10.116 --> 17:11.726
- You are not a boring adult.

17:11.769 --> 17:14.381
- No. I am.

17:14.424 --> 17:15.512
You wanna know why
I really wanted

17:15.556 --> 17:17.079
that year of no paperwork?

17:17.123 --> 17:18.298
It's so if we did get pregnant,

17:18.341 --> 17:20.343
I would have more time
to help with the baby.

17:20.387 --> 17:22.128
- Aww.
- No, save your "aww."

17:22.171 --> 17:24.478
I don't deserve it. I'm just
some boring, responsible guy

17:24.521 --> 17:26.001
that's about to lose our car.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.394
- You're still
pretty irresponsible.

17:27.437 --> 17:28.656
-  Aww.

17:28.699 --> 17:30.397
You're just saying that
'cause you're my wife.

17:30.440 --> 17:31.920
- No, I'm not.

17:31.963 --> 17:33.400
Yesterday,
you took the batteries

17:33.443 --> 17:34.836
out of our smoke detector

17:34.879 --> 17:36.925
to put in your
Big Mouth Billy Bass.

17:36.968 --> 17:38.927
- You noticed.
- Yeah.

17:38.970 --> 17:40.755
In a bad way.
- Yeah.

17:40.798 --> 17:43.192
- Now get up,
and win this bet.

17:43.236 --> 17:45.412
You can do this.
- Yeah, you're right.

17:45.455 --> 17:46.978
I can do this.
- Yeah.

17:49.590 --> 17:51.244
Yeah, I maybe can't do this.

17:51.287 --> 17:53.289
- The time has come
for the grand finale,

17:53.333 --> 17:54.421
the obstacle course.

17:54.464 --> 17:56.118
- This is gonna be rough.

17:56.162 --> 17:58.120
Turns out,
taking a ton of random pills

17:58.164 --> 17:59.426
is really bad for you.

17:59.469 --> 18:01.036
Everything hurts.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.169
- Yeah, I'm like
50/50 gonna die.

18:03.212 --> 18:06.128
- On your mark, get set,
dazzle me, freaks!

18:07.869 --> 18:11.133
First, you must make your way
past the barricade hurdles.

18:11.177 --> 18:12.917
- After the hurdles,

18:12.961 --> 18:15.224
you must fish a dollar coin
out of our gross,

18:15.268 --> 18:18.053
clogged-up
sink of nightmares.

18:19.141 --> 18:21.100
- Ahh!
- Ew.

18:21.143 --> 18:23.145
- You use that money
to buy a hot dog.

18:23.189 --> 18:24.407
After you eat the entire dog,

18:24.451 --> 18:25.974
you'll return
to the break room,

18:26.017 --> 18:27.410
where you must extract
an olive

18:27.454 --> 18:30.196
from the windpipe
of a Heimlich practice dummy.

18:30.239 --> 18:32.198
- Why are you using your mouth
for everything?

18:32.241 --> 18:33.938
- The winner
will be the first person

18:33.982 --> 18:36.463
to sit in
the Ringmaster's throne.

18:36.506 --> 18:38.508
Uh-oh, surprise twist!

18:38.552 --> 18:40.858
To get to the throne,
you must break through

18:40.902 --> 18:42.599
a breach training door.
- What?

18:42.643 --> 18:44.253
Why are you making this
so hard on me?

18:44.297 --> 18:45.385
- It's all for the show, Jake.

18:45.428 --> 18:47.038
The greatest show on Earth!

18:47.082 --> 18:49.476
- All right, fine.
I can do this.

18:49.519 --> 18:52.174
For my wife.

19:01.270 --> 19:02.445
Ah, it didn't work.

19:02.489 --> 19:04.273
My skeleton feels like
it's made of Skittles.

19:04.317 --> 19:06.971
I can't do it, Amy.
- Yes, you can, okay?

19:07.015 --> 19:08.495
You just need a little energy.

19:08.538 --> 19:10.192
And Debbie's EpiPens
are full of adrenaline.

19:10.236 --> 19:11.889
- Is that a smart thing to do?
- Probably not,

19:11.933 --> 19:14.109
but sometimes it's good
to be a little irresponsible.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.154
- You're gonna make me sick.

19:15.197 --> 19:16.242
- It's better
than losing our car.

19:16.285 --> 19:19.419
- I mean, is it? 'Cause--

19:19.462 --> 19:23.118
I will never die!

19:23.162 --> 19:25.120
- Yeah!
- Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

19:25.164 --> 19:27.253
Whoo-hoo-hoo! Hoo!
- Jake is champion!

19:27.296 --> 19:29.429
Congratulations,
you inherit the circus!

19:29.472 --> 19:32.388
- I did it!
I don't want the circus.

19:37.959 --> 19:39.134
- You like it?
- Not at all.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.527
- You can leave.
- Not a chance.

19:42.572 --> 19:45.184
- The show is over,
lessons were learned,

19:45.227 --> 19:46.228
tears were cried.

19:46.272 --> 19:47.664
Just remember, freaks,

19:47.708 --> 19:50.450
the real freak
is the freak inside.

19:50.493 --> 19:54.236
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
Debbie Fogel.

20:26.616 --> 20:29.053
- Whoa-ho-ho,
you hear that?

20:29.097 --> 20:31.273
It's the total silence
of people reeling

20:31.317 --> 20:32.927
from the performance
of a lifetime.

20:32.970 --> 20:34.450
How does it feel?
- Incredible.

20:34.494 --> 20:37.279
I've never been that loud.
- That's what most singing is.

20:37.323 --> 20:39.107
And with more practice,
you'll only get louder.

20:39.150 --> 20:40.717
Do you really think
they liked it?

20:40.761 --> 20:43.111
It doesn't matter
what other people think.

20:43.154 --> 20:45.418
What matters
is that you can do anything

20:45.461 --> 20:47.071
you put your mind to,
because in the end,

20:47.115 --> 20:50.727
my bearded lady,
the beard was under you,

20:50.771 --> 20:53.556
the greatest showman.

20:53.600 --> 20:56.298
You're right.
