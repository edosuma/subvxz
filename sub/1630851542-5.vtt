00:09.793 --> 00:14.551
- Alexa? How many ounces
are in 2 cups?

00:14.655 --> 00:17.172
- ALEXA: 2 cups is
16 fluid ounces.

00:17.275 --> 00:19.655
- Thanks.

00:19.758 --> 00:22.310
Alexa, where do
pancakes come from?

00:24.034 --> 00:26.793
- ALEXA: The Ancient Greeks
made pancakes called tiganítes.

00:26.896 --> 00:30.551
The word derives from
tigáni, meaning "frying pan."

00:30.655 --> 00:33.586
- Ah. I thought
it was the Chinese.

00:33.689 --> 00:37.482
The Chinese love inventing
things, like the compass

00:37.586 --> 00:41.310
and fireworks
and gunpowder.

00:41.413 --> 00:43.896
And part of Naomi Campbell.
He, he!

00:44.000 --> 00:47.310
Did you know that Naomi Campbell
was part Chinese?

00:47.413 --> 00:50.137
Oh hey, I made some
special breakfast for you.

00:50.241 --> 00:51.310
- I can't.
I gotta go to work.

00:51.413 --> 00:52.620
I'll be back later, though.

00:54.724 --> 00:58.482
- It's okay. I'll eat
the pancakes by myself.

00:58.586 --> 01:00.862
- [sad violin]
- And then I'll die.

01:00.965 --> 01:05.517
I'll collapse on the floor
and nobody will find me.

01:05.620 --> 01:09.241
And then the maggots will
come and just eat me out.

01:16.862 --> 01:19.551
- Hello?
- MAN: Hello, is this Mrs. Lin?

01:19.655 --> 01:21.793
- Speaking?
- MAN: Hi, Mrs. Lin.

01:21.896 --> 01:23.586
It appears that there's
been an error at the bank.

01:23.689 --> 01:25.551
And we have $50
that belongs to you.

01:25.655 --> 01:26.724
We can credit your account now

01:26.827 --> 01:28.310
if you're able to confirm
your account number.

01:28.413 --> 01:31.206
- Okay, uh, you know,
uh, I'm not sure.

01:31.310 --> 01:34.724
Let me find my card.
Oh, here it is.

01:34.827 --> 01:35.862
- MAN: Go ahead.

01:35.965 --> 01:39.724
- The number is four,
five, seven, nine,

01:39.827 --> 01:41.517
Fuck off, you scammer!

01:50.241 --> 01:53.448
- So, we're all here.

01:53.551 --> 01:55.172
Wait, where's Shu Shu?

01:55.275 --> 01:56.827
- She said she can't make it.

01:56.931 --> 02:00.000
Maybe she's still recovering
from the flesh-eating bacteria.

02:00.103 --> 02:02.482
- Typical Shu Shu.

02:02.586 --> 02:05.793
Well, anyway, it was Siqi's
turn to pick the book this time.

02:05.896 --> 02:08.310
- I hope everyone
enjoyed "Little Women"

02:08.413 --> 02:10.137
by Louisa May Alcott.

02:10.241 --> 02:12.310
- To be honest, I did not.

02:12.413 --> 02:16.137
- Yes, a better title
would've been "White Women."

02:16.241 --> 02:17.379
- Mm-hmm.

02:21.206 --> 02:23.586
- Hello? Oh, sure.

02:23.689 --> 02:27.241
My account number is
six, nine, six, nine,

02:27.344 --> 02:29.241
fuck off!

02:29.344 --> 02:32.517
Ay-ah, can you believe
these tele-scammers?

02:32.620 --> 02:36.310
They think we're stupid, like
us Chinese can't smell a trap.

02:36.413 --> 02:39.034
Saying I have $50 credit
in my bank account.

02:39.137 --> 02:43.034
- He said a credit of $50?
- Yeah!

02:43.137 --> 02:45.000
And his voice
was clearly altered

02:45.103 --> 02:46.620
like he was
some kind of robot.

02:46.724 --> 02:49.586
- Oh no! I think
I got the same call.

02:49.689 --> 02:50.586
- Me too.

02:50.689 --> 02:53.206
- You didn't
fall for it, right?

02:53.310 --> 02:55.551
- I sent him a selfie
with my debit card.

02:55.655 --> 02:57.517
- I faxed him my
birth certificate.

02:57.620 --> 03:00.172
- You have to check
your bank accounts.

03:00.275 --> 03:01.862
I think you got scammed!

03:01.965 --> 03:03.827
- Ooh!
- That's it!

03:03.931 --> 03:06.103
We have to do
something about this.

03:14.448 --> 03:17.034
- I'm here to report
multiple crimes.

03:17.137 --> 03:18.551
- What can I do for you?

03:18.655 --> 03:21.965
- My friends got ripped
off by a telephone scammer.

03:22.068 --> 03:25.275
He got their bank account
numbers and stole from them.

03:25.379 --> 03:28.241
$120 each!
- Okay.

03:28.344 --> 03:31.137
Someone will be out to give
you some paperwork to fill out.

03:31.241 --> 03:33.862
- We don't have time for forms!
Where's the sheriff?

03:33.965 --> 03:36.965
- Nonviolent cases are
automatically lower priority.

03:37.068 --> 03:41.137
We have drug dealers.
We have stabbings.

03:41.241 --> 03:43.310
So if you and your friends
could please take a seat,

03:43.413 --> 03:45.000
someone will be with you.

03:53.482 --> 03:56.689
- Congrats on the wedding.

03:56.793 --> 03:58.172
- NORA: We have a bevy
of different strains

03:58.275 --> 03:59.517
in the CBD world.

03:59.620 --> 04:01.379
Upper--you know, you
drink a cup of coffee,

04:01.482 --> 04:02.655
feel like having
a little diarrhea,

04:02.758 --> 04:04.413
this is not gonna
make you that up.

04:04.517 --> 04:05.965
I think on a scale of
coffee to crystal meth,

04:06.068 --> 04:08.206
this probably lies
well below coffee.

04:08.310 --> 04:09.310
It doesn't really work.

04:09.413 --> 04:11.448
But, this one,
actually very special.

04:11.551 --> 04:12.758
It's a lube, right?

04:12.862 --> 04:14.448
But lube can be used
for all sorts of things,

04:14.551 --> 04:15.931
not just tires, right?

04:16.034 --> 04:20.413
I would put it up...
in my asshole...

04:20.517 --> 04:22.655
Hold it. If you
just would excuse me.

04:27.034 --> 04:28.655
- You should do a
focus group or two.

04:28.758 --> 04:29.931
I think you'd be amazing at it.

04:30.034 --> 04:31.896
- Oh, shit!
- Hey!

04:34.103 --> 04:35.689
- How long have the two
of you been partners?

04:35.793 --> 04:38.620
- Partners?
It's like one kiss.

04:43.034 --> 04:44.241
- Nora!
- [yelps]

04:44.344 --> 04:45.586
- What's going on?

04:45.689 --> 04:47.551
- What are you doing
here, Margaret?

04:47.655 --> 04:49.551
You are on the FBI's
Most Wanted List.

04:49.655 --> 04:51.344
- I'm not anymore.
They cut me a deal.

04:51.448 --> 04:52.482
I missed you.

04:52.586 --> 04:53.655
- Oh, they made you a deal?

04:53.758 --> 04:55.206
What are you, fucking Big Lots?

04:55.310 --> 04:56.344
- MARGARET: No, truly, though.

04:56.448 --> 04:57.586
It turns out if you
just turn somebody in

04:57.689 --> 04:58.655
that's doing some stuff,

04:58.758 --> 05:00.206
the FBI just
totally lets you go.

05:00.310 --> 05:01.793
And my brother-in-law?

05:01.896 --> 05:03.689
He was just taking
hot, wet dumps in, like,

05:03.793 --> 05:04.931
public parking lots?

05:05.034 --> 05:07.034
And people don't like
that shit, literally.

05:07.137 --> 05:09.241
And he also had sex
with a couple of rare birds

05:09.344 --> 05:10.655
but, you know,
to each their own.

05:10.758 --> 05:12.344
So I turned him in
and he got arrested.

05:12.448 --> 05:14.034
And so here I am.
How are you doing?

05:14.137 --> 05:15.827
Good? You look good.

05:15.931 --> 05:18.827
- You almost put me in jail.
You remember that, Margaret?

05:18.931 --> 05:22.034
- Look, this is a
legitimate job for me, okay?

05:22.137 --> 05:25.310
I'm not trying to scam anybody.
That's in my past.

05:25.413 --> 05:27.965
What's in the past
is in the P-A-S-T.

05:28.068 --> 05:29.758
You know what that spells?
- Past.

05:29.862 --> 05:32.379
- I'm on the
straight and narrow.

05:32.482 --> 05:34.793
Mostly narrow.

05:34.896 --> 05:37.379
Did I mention you look good?

05:37.482 --> 05:38.793
So good.
- Thank you.

05:38.896 --> 05:40.965
- Like you're just drinking
all the pineapple juices.

05:41.068 --> 05:42.862
Is this a wig?
'Cuz this is a good wig.

05:42.965 --> 05:45.206
- No, all mine, all mine.
- Is it?

05:49.068 --> 05:53.000
- Those cops are assholes.
Just because it's, what?

05:53.103 --> 05:56.586
Not a murder?
I'll murder their faces.

06:01.689 --> 06:03.206
- MAN: Hello, Mrs. Lin.

06:03.310 --> 06:05.896
Did you enjoy your little
tattletale trip to the cops?

06:06.000 --> 06:08.586
I'm sure that they were
very helpful in giving back

06:08.689 --> 06:11.482
all this money that
I stole from your friends--

06:11.586 --> 06:14.413
who by the way,
are now all broke as shit.

06:14.517 --> 06:16.827
- [gasps]
He's taunting me!

06:16.931 --> 06:18.896
He's taunting us.
- MAN: That's correct.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.379
Too bad you can't stop
me from doing it again.

06:21.482 --> 06:23.689
In fact, I've already
done it again.

06:23.793 --> 06:25.551
- What does that mean?
Done it to who?

06:30.241 --> 06:32.413
- Shu Shu!
Are you okay?

06:36.172 --> 06:38.068
- Hi.
- Oh my god.

06:38.172 --> 06:39.827
Did you get scammed too?

06:42.103 --> 06:43.310
That's it.

06:43.413 --> 06:47.206
This bitch is gonna die.
- Fuck yeah.

06:50.413 --> 06:52.482
- I faxed him a proof of payment
and my driver's license because

06:52.586 --> 06:54.068
he told me he would throw in
a gift certificate

06:54.172 --> 06:55.517
to Edible Arrangements.

06:55.620 --> 07:01.000
- Shu Shu, how is it that
you still look so good?

07:01.103 --> 07:03.379
- Stop. I look young
on the outside.

07:03.482 --> 07:06.655
But internally,
I have prolapsed.

07:06.758 --> 07:09.344
- Oh, thank god.
- Yeah, I can tell.

07:09.448 --> 07:11.172
- The only thing
that's gonna prolapse

07:11.275 --> 07:13.275
is this scammer asshole!

07:13.379 --> 07:18.586
Since the police won't help us,
we must resort to plan B.

07:18.689 --> 07:21.000
We take him on ourselves.

07:21.103 --> 07:25.000
Siqi, you have a moderately
successful Etsy store

07:25.103 --> 07:26.310
and animals love you.

07:26.413 --> 07:28.827
You're basically
a dog whisperer.

07:28.931 --> 07:31.689
Shu Shu has broken
every bone in her body

07:31.793 --> 07:33.206
through freak accidents.

07:33.310 --> 07:35.517
But she's an all-around badass.

07:35.620 --> 07:38.275
Iris, you are criminally cute.

07:38.379 --> 07:40.000
And you always
have lotion on hand.

07:40.103 --> 07:43.137
You can get us out of
any sticky situation.

07:43.241 --> 07:46.620
And I'm our fearless leader.

07:46.724 --> 07:48.758
Voiceover queen, amazing friend,

07:48.862 --> 07:51.689
I once ate a fuck ton
of shrimps.

07:51.793 --> 07:55.862
So, first let's find out where
the hell he's calling from.

07:55.965 --> 07:58.275
- On it.
I'm Googling the number.

08:00.241 --> 08:05.137
He's calling from...from the
G&Y Food Mart on 30th Avenue.

08:05.241 --> 08:10.068
- All right, then.
Let's go there and kick his ass!

08:18.827 --> 08:20.482
- Can I help you?
- Yeah!

08:20.586 --> 08:24.206
You can start by giving my
friends their money back, thief!

08:24.310 --> 08:25.344
- I'm sorry.

08:25.448 --> 08:27.103
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

08:27.206 --> 08:30.137
- Liar. You are running a
phone scam out of this bodega

08:30.241 --> 08:31.344
and we want justice!

08:31.448 --> 08:33.068
- No, I'm not.

08:33.172 --> 08:35.206
Our number is
spoofed all the time.

08:35.310 --> 08:36.448
- What!?

08:36.551 --> 08:38.827
- It wasn't anybody
actually calling from here.

08:38.931 --> 08:41.000
They were just
faking the number.

08:41.103 --> 08:43.586
Now, I'm sorry, but the
nervous teenager behind you

08:43.689 --> 08:46.137
is trying to buy condoms.

08:46.241 --> 08:48.965
- MAN: Hello, Mrs. Lin.

08:49.068 --> 08:51.482
Good job tracking
down the bodega.

08:51.586 --> 08:53.862
Did you really think
that I was stupid enough

08:53.965 --> 08:55.724
to use my own phone number?

08:55.827 --> 08:57.551
Maybe I'll go here next.

08:57.655 --> 08:59.724
- He knows where I live?
- MAN: Or here.

08:59.827 --> 09:02.482
- IRIS: [gasps]
He knows where we all live?

09:02.586 --> 09:04.862
- MAN: That's correct.
The fun is going to continue.

09:04.965 --> 09:06.310
'Cuz I'm gonna
scam this grandma.

09:07.517 --> 09:08.620
- MAN: And this one.
- [gasping]

09:08.724 --> 09:09.827
- MAN: And this one.
- [gasping]

09:09.931 --> 09:11.344
- MAN: And this one.
- [gasping]

09:11.448 --> 09:14.275
- MAN: And there's
nothing you can do to stop me.

09:15.379 --> 09:17.724
Oh, by the way, try
the Fuego Chili Lime Takis

09:17.827 --> 09:19.241
in the last aisle.

09:19.344 --> 09:22.620
They'll take your tongue skin
right off, but in a good way.

09:22.724 --> 09:25.344
- What the hell was that
"V for Vendetta" shit?

09:30.068 --> 09:31.241
- MARGARET: This'll
make your hands tingly,

09:31.344 --> 09:33.241
but don't put it on your
tongue--unless you want to.

09:33.344 --> 09:35.172
Unless you have a lot of
homework, you know what I mean?

09:35.275 --> 09:36.862
Also, I can just find
you something stronger--

09:36.965 --> 09:40.448
- Hey. You got Blue Shoes?

09:40.551 --> 09:42.689
- Um, I--I don't
know what those are.

09:42.793 --> 09:46.793
- Come one,
I know you have 'em.

09:46.896 --> 09:48.689
- Let me--let me
go ask my manager--

09:48.793 --> 09:50.655
- No, no, no.
I--I--I know you got 'em.

09:50.758 --> 09:53.310
This is where I always get 'em.

09:53.413 --> 09:54.379
- We have a blue bath bomb.

09:54.482 --> 09:56.586
- Dick pills!

09:56.689 --> 09:58.482
- We don't sell dick pills here.

09:58.586 --> 10:00.896
- Her. Curlita!
She got them for me.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.137
- Hey, Oscar!
- Right back, okay?

10:03.241 --> 10:05.172
- What's up?
- What are you doing in here?

10:05.275 --> 10:07.172
- What do you mean?
I'm working like you doin'.

10:07.275 --> 10:11.482
- You are selling dick pills.
- What are you talking about?

10:11.586 --> 10:13.241
Okay, you need
your green juice today.

10:13.344 --> 10:14.482
Will you take care of them?

10:14.586 --> 10:15.827
They're ready to spend
some money they don't have

10:15.931 --> 10:18.275
and I'm here for it.
Hey, Oscar.

10:18.379 --> 10:19.655
- OSCAR: [whispers] Hey,
Curlita, how are you?

10:19.758 --> 10:20.827
- I'm good.

10:20.931 --> 10:23.068
I love that you
love Blue Ivy Carter.

10:23.172 --> 10:26.517
She's making an appearance.
- Yes, tonight, tonight.

10:26.620 --> 10:28.517
- Yes, and we do
love Blue so much.

10:32.137 --> 10:34.965
- That hacker is
underestimating us.

10:35.068 --> 10:38.448
He doesn't know that my grandson
is also a computer genius.

10:38.551 --> 10:40.896
- You know, I'm an actor now.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.379
I haven't actually hacked
into anything in over a year.

10:43.482 --> 10:44.896
Not since I accidently uploaded

10:45.000 --> 10:46.862
the wrong workout photo
to Scruff--

10:46.965 --> 10:50.758
- Will you stop thinking
about ass and help us?

10:50.862 --> 10:52.620
- Sorry, okay.

10:52.724 --> 10:55.793
Um, let me find
the IP addresses

10:55.896 --> 10:57.172
that are linked
to the bank accounts

10:57.275 --> 10:59.862
and we'll go from there.
It shouldn't take too long.

11:24.655 --> 11:25.931
- EDMUND: Okay, I need a break.

11:38.310 --> 11:39.551
- I got it!

11:39.655 --> 11:41.000
I found the address where
he's getting the cash delivered!

11:41.103 --> 11:43.206
- Oh, I am so ready
to cut a bitch!

11:43.310 --> 11:47.275
- Ah, thank you for
helping us, Edmund.

11:47.379 --> 11:48.862
- No, thank you, Grandma.

11:48.965 --> 11:51.827
I think I sweat so much
that I lost 5 pounds.

11:51.931 --> 11:53.827
I'm gonna be so thin
for my audition.

11:53.931 --> 11:56.827
- Oh, audition?
What for?

11:56.931 --> 11:58.655
- Okay, so it's this cross
between "Dear Evan Hansen"

11:58.758 --> 11:59.862
and "Cabin in the Woods"--

11:59.965 --> 12:02.551
- Edmund, I don't
give a shit right now.

12:02.655 --> 12:04.620
But Grandma loves you.

12:09.310 --> 12:10.793
- [whispers] Penis
enhancement drug ring...

12:10.896 --> 12:12.310
Long Island...

12:12.413 --> 12:14.655
24 people arrested?

12:30.931 --> 12:35.206
- [gasps] I knew it!
Blue Shoes.

12:35.310 --> 12:38.793
I knew there was
a dick pill conspiracy.

12:41.413 --> 12:42.551
- SHU SHU: Now what?

12:42.655 --> 12:47.413
- Now we get revenge.

12:47.517 --> 12:49.482
Don't fuck with grandmas.

12:53.620 --> 12:54.862
- GRANDMA:
Okay, it's pretty clear

12:54.965 --> 12:57.586
there's one best way
to do this.

12:57.689 --> 13:01.310
We'll have to stealthily
sneak into the house.

13:01.413 --> 13:04.000
- SIQI: Wait, which one
of us is doing the flips?

13:04.103 --> 13:06.172
- GRANDMA: Shut up, Siqi.
Don't interrupt me.

13:06.275 --> 13:10.413
There is a dog door.
That's how we're getting in.

13:10.517 --> 13:12.448
We'll sneak through the kitchen.

13:12.551 --> 13:16.482
Then we'll charge upstairs
and take down the scammer.

13:16.586 --> 13:18.586
- Amazing. Let's go.

13:18.689 --> 13:22.793
- Eh, it's 8:15 and
I'm pretty tired.

13:22.896 --> 13:24.965
- Me too.
- Yeah.

13:25.068 --> 13:27.724
- Okay, what if we all
get a good night's sleep

13:27.827 --> 13:30.275
and then reconvene
at 4:00 in the morning,

13:30.379 --> 13:31.827
when it's still dark?

13:31.931 --> 13:34.793
- Great.
- Love it!

13:34.896 --> 13:37.482
I'm just gonna sleep
here tonight, okay?

13:45.620 --> 13:47.034
- [whispers] Hey, Merlene?
- Hey.

13:47.137 --> 13:49.241
- Can I just talk to
you for a quick second?

13:49.344 --> 13:52.275
- Traditionally one works at a
job for longer than a few months

13:52.379 --> 13:53.896
before asking for a raise.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.827
- No, I'm not--I'm not
asking for a raise.

13:55.931 --> 13:59.862
Um...it's Margaret.
- Love her.

13:59.965 --> 14:04.379
- Right, she's also, like, a
maniacal con artist/ex-convict.

14:04.482 --> 14:06.068
- She's my best salesperson.

14:06.172 --> 14:10.517
- I have photo evidence--
photo evidence--

14:10.620 --> 14:12.620
that she is selling drugs
up in here.

14:12.724 --> 14:14.758
And not these kinds of drugs.

14:14.862 --> 14:16.724
[whispers] Penis drugs.

14:16.827 --> 14:19.000
- [sighs] Follow me.

14:25.172 --> 14:26.896
- I surrender!

14:27.000 --> 14:29.586
- Oh, hey, boo-boo. To what?
What are you surrendered to?

14:29.689 --> 14:31.206
A maxi dress?

14:31.310 --> 14:32.344
- Are you in on this?

14:32.448 --> 14:34.482
- There's a CBD store
on every block now.

14:34.586 --> 14:36.034
And Nora, I have a family.

14:36.137 --> 14:37.965
- You have two
chinchillas, Merlene.

14:38.068 --> 14:39.896
- Yeah, and one of
them has diabetes.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.103
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

14:41.206 --> 14:43.103
I donated to your
GoFundMe, by the way.

14:43.206 --> 14:44.655
- Thank you so much,
Margaret. She's...

14:44.758 --> 14:47.517
- MARGARET: Yeah, I'm the best.

14:47.620 --> 14:49.172
Come on, Nora,
just join us, okay?

14:49.275 --> 14:51.827
I do the sales.
Merlene does the distro.

14:51.931 --> 14:53.689
He gets the goods for
the supplies and whatnot.

14:53.793 --> 14:54.931
Ah, come on.

14:55.034 --> 14:56.655
And, like, Oscar,
Sad Dad, always has a boner.

14:56.758 --> 14:57.793
- Eew.

14:57.896 --> 14:59.137
- It's a win-win.
Come join us.

14:59.241 --> 15:02.137
- No, this is--this is wrong.
This is not okay.

15:02.241 --> 15:05.931
- Come on, be cool, be chill.
You know, we were lovers once.

15:06.034 --> 15:07.793
She was very chill back then.

15:07.896 --> 15:10.862
- It was a one kiss situation.
No tongue.

15:10.965 --> 15:12.482
- It was so much more to me.

15:12.586 --> 15:15.689
I mean...you should see
the memories on my phone.

15:15.793 --> 15:17.689
I'm just saying,
Nora, lighten up.

15:17.793 --> 15:18.793
We could use your help.

15:18.896 --> 15:20.551
You'd make 2 grand a week.

15:26.965 --> 15:29.758
- Iris!
What the fuck is that?

15:29.862 --> 15:31.275
We're supposed
to wear all black.

15:31.379 --> 15:32.413
- It's camouflage.

15:32.517 --> 15:35.275
- That's flowers!
And what the fuck is that?

15:35.379 --> 15:36.620
- A shoehorn.

15:36.724 --> 15:40.517
- What--ah, never mind.
It's go time.

15:56.448 --> 15:57.517
- GRANDMA: Uh oh.

15:57.620 --> 16:01.344
This dog door's a lot
smaller than we thought.

16:01.448 --> 16:04.551
- My bones are soft and pliable
because of osteoporosis.

16:04.655 --> 16:05.896
I got this.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
I just need Siqi to
take care of the dog.

16:10.862 --> 16:13.137
- Here, puppy, puppy, puppy!

16:13.241 --> 16:14.724
- ALL: Oh!
- [Chihuahua barks]

16:14.827 --> 16:16.517
- A Chihuahua!

16:17.965 --> 16:19.689
Iris, you're up.

16:19.793 --> 16:21.344
- Lotion bitch time.

16:25.068 --> 16:28.586
- Time to shine, Shu Shu.

16:31.551 --> 16:32.482
Boop.

16:58.034 --> 16:59.896
- [hushed chatter in Chinese]
IRIS & SIQI: Walk faster!

17:00.000 --> 17:01.482
[chatter continues in Chinese]
- IRIS: Go, go!

17:01.586 --> 17:04.000
[chatter continues in Chinese]
- SIQI: Don't be so loud!

17:14.793 --> 17:16.448
- Oh, what the fuck,
Shu Shu?

17:16.551 --> 17:17.655
- Help me!

17:22.620 --> 17:25.172
- Oh, shit. It's a kid.

17:25.275 --> 17:28.413
- It's you. How did you...

17:28.517 --> 17:31.586
Help! Help! Child in danger!
Child in danger!

17:31.689 --> 17:33.241
- How do we get him to shut up?

17:33.344 --> 17:36.379
- We do what grandmas
do best: feed him.

17:38.068 --> 17:39.896
- Actually, I am pretty hungry.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.482
- Aw, shut up.

17:45.827 --> 17:48.000
- MERLENE: Nora, you already
work for me selling CBD.

17:48.103 --> 17:50.068
This is basically
the same thing.

17:50.172 --> 17:51.931
- Who doesn't wanna be
part of the Rod Squad?

17:52.034 --> 17:53.344
Look how cool we are.

17:53.448 --> 17:57.034
We are helping sad dads
all across the country.

17:57.137 --> 17:58.793
We are saving marriages.

17:58.896 --> 18:00.758
Don't you wanna help that dick?

18:00.862 --> 18:03.862
- No, no, sorry,
no, no, I can't, I can't.

18:03.965 --> 18:05.620
- Okay, fine.

18:05.724 --> 18:07.689
But if you change your mind,
you know where to find me.

18:07.793 --> 18:09.241
By the way, I'm not
going by Margaret anymore.

18:09.344 --> 18:11.275
I'm going by Beef.
- Why?

18:11.379 --> 18:13.103
- Because it's delicious and
you always wanna eat it.

18:13.206 --> 18:15.793
Duh! It's what's for dinner.

18:15.896 --> 18:19.517
And lunch. It's low carb.
High protein.

18:19.620 --> 18:22.241
Come on, you know you have,
like, a iron deficiency.

18:22.344 --> 18:24.724
It's how I came up with
it in the first place.

18:24.827 --> 18:26.655
- [whispers]
Did you have to... Okay.

18:26.758 --> 18:28.827
- Remember you always talked
about the Atkins Diet?

18:28.931 --> 18:30.655
Beef all day, boo-boo.

18:30.758 --> 18:31.862
- Great, awesome.

18:31.965 --> 18:34.758
Well, with that in
mind, I guess I quit.

18:34.862 --> 18:36.586
- If you're quitting, you
need to return your shirt.

18:36.689 --> 18:38.068
It's $39.

18:38.172 --> 18:39.862
- I will return
the shirt, Merlene.

18:39.965 --> 18:42.137
- MARGARET: Love you!

18:42.241 --> 18:43.655
Your dick's gonna break.

18:45.413 --> 18:47.344
- I didn't mean to
hurt any of you guys.

18:47.448 --> 18:49.655
It's why I just took a
little bit from each person.

18:49.758 --> 18:52.931
- A little to you can mean
a lot to someone else.

18:53.034 --> 18:54.379
- I guess.

18:55.551 --> 18:59.275
I...I was just trying to do
enough to get noticed.

18:59.379 --> 19:02.000
Nobody notices me.
My parents are never there.

19:02.103 --> 19:04.034
Just...

19:04.137 --> 19:06.379
I literally didn't have
anything better to do.

19:06.482 --> 19:09.172
- You know, nobody
notices us either.

19:09.275 --> 19:12.896
Old people, young people,
nobody takes us seriously.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.103
- Well, obviously
not old people. Duh.

19:18.172 --> 19:20.724
- My friend wants to kill you.

19:20.827 --> 19:22.482
But I know you're a good kid.

19:22.586 --> 19:25.413
Just promise me you
won't scam anybody again.

19:25.517 --> 19:27.172
- Yeah, yeah, okay.
- GRANDMA: Good.

19:27.275 --> 19:30.655
But you're gonna have
to eat an entire durian

19:30.758 --> 19:32.034
in under 60 seconds.

19:32.137 --> 19:33.310
- Wait, no, no, no.

19:33.413 --> 19:35.448
It says no outside
food right over there.

19:35.551 --> 19:37.034
- We're a bunch of
old people and a kid.

19:37.137 --> 19:38.379
Who's gonna notice?

19:38.482 --> 19:41.413
- One Mississippi,
two Mississippi...

19:41.517 --> 19:43.655
- No, no, no, really.
I'm allergic to Asian food--

19:43.758 --> 19:48.000
- Eat the durian, bitch.
- With stinky tofu.

19:48.103 --> 19:51.206
- Three Missi--oh,
nominy nom nom nom.

19:51.310 --> 19:53.172
- Chew it.
- Yum.

19:58.620 --> 20:00.655
- Ah, yeah.

20:00.758 --> 20:04.827
[laughs] Oh, yeah.

20:04.931 --> 20:06.827
- You weren't kidding when
you said shopping spree, huh?

20:06.931 --> 20:09.724
- GRANDMA: Yeah, we got the
money back from that scammer.

20:09.827 --> 20:11.896
Well, from his parents.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.137
This is gonna be the
best book club ever.

20:14.241 --> 20:16.275
- I should start
reading some more.

20:16.379 --> 20:18.689
I have time now
that I quit my job.

20:18.793 --> 20:20.793
- What? What happened?

20:20.896 --> 20:22.586
- It just, um...

20:22.689 --> 20:24.620
You know, it wasn't
the right fit for me.

20:24.724 --> 20:25.965
That's okay.

20:26.068 --> 20:27.482
I'm gonna find something else
and it'll be good.

20:27.586 --> 20:30.586
- Okay, I'm sure you'll find
something soon, Bao Bao.

20:30.689 --> 20:32.310
- I want to see what
the fuss is all about

20:32.413 --> 20:34.137
with these spicy lime
fuego chips.

20:34.241 --> 20:36.103
- NORA: Be careful with those.

20:36.206 --> 20:39.275
- I think those are for young
people, Shu Shu, not you!

20:42.620 --> 20:48.448
- Hah, hah, hah, hah, oh....

20:50.172 --> 20:52.551
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

20:52.655 --> 20:54.827
Oh, shit, my tongue skin!

20:54.931 --> 20:57.793
My tongue skin! Oh my god!

21:31.241 --> 21:33.206
- Who the
[bleep] is Awkwafina?
