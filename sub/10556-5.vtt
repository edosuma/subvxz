Just a penny, sir.

00:49.116 --> 00:51.118
Just a penny.

00:51.118 --> 00:52.686
Be kind, sir, just
a penny or two.

00:52.686 --> 00:56.056
Penny or two, sir.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.057
Careful, Mother.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.458
Spare a penny, sir.

00:58.458 --> 01:00.561
Thomas, no beggar will
be ruining Wendell's day.

01:00.561 --> 01:01.395
Right.

01:01.395 --> 01:03.030
You, out of here.

01:03.030 --> 01:04.298
You have no right
to be ordering me.

01:04.298 --> 01:09.503
You will get out of here, or
it's a beating you will get.

01:09.503 --> 01:11.204

Thomas.

01:14.441 --> 01:15.275
Mrs. Merrick.

01:15.275 --> 01:16.109
Reverend Franks.

01:16.109 --> 01:17.277
Have you seen my brother?

01:17.277 --> 01:19.179
Preparing himself, I believe.

01:19.179 --> 01:20.480
He has the last-minute jitters.

01:20.480 --> 01:23.216
Oh, just like him.

01:23.216 --> 01:25.252
Thomas, make sure
that he's all right.

01:25.252 --> 01:26.119
Yes, Mother.

01:34.227 --> 01:35.596
Wait here, Mother.

01:35.596 --> 01:39.533
It would be just like Wendell
to foul up his own wedding.

01:39.533 --> 01:41.268
I'll make sure that
does not happen.

01:48.342 --> 01:50.744
Lawrence, shouldn't the
best man be with the groom?

01:53.614 --> 01:54.581
What now?

01:57.417 --> 01:59.386
I've pinched my cheeks
till they're sore,

01:59.386 --> 02:00.621
and I'm still so pale.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.055
Oh, please.

02:02.055 --> 02:03.256
You'll make yourself ill.

02:03.256 --> 02:05.993
But I want to be pretty.

02:05.993 --> 02:08.061
Wendell loves you, Eunice.

02:08.061 --> 02:10.230
He doesn't care
about your looks.

02:10.230 --> 02:12.633
We should all be so lucky.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.735
That's not what I mean.

02:14.735 --> 02:18.438
Eunice, every bride worries
about her wedding night.

02:18.438 --> 02:19.606
It will be fine.

02:34.488 --> 02:37.057
No.

02:37.057 --> 02:40.027
I'll find out.

02:40.027 --> 02:40.761
Reverend.

02:40.761 --> 02:41.995
Where is Wendell?

02:41.995 --> 02:44.031
I was wondering the same thing.

02:44.031 --> 02:46.667
The last I saw him was in the
meeting room half an hour ago.

02:46.667 --> 02:49.670
Well, that's where I
last saw him as well.

02:49.670 --> 02:50.504
Right.

02:56.076 --> 02:57.044
Wendell, what--

03:12.025 --> 03:13.727
The victim's name
is Wendell Merrick.

03:13.727 --> 03:15.162
It was his wedding day.

03:15.162 --> 03:15.996
Tragic.

03:15.996 --> 03:17.164
How's the family?

03:17.164 --> 03:19.533
The bride and bridesmaid have
returned to their apartment.

03:19.533 --> 03:22.269
The groom's brother has
taken their mother home.

03:22.269 --> 03:23.270
I have the addresses.

03:23.270 --> 03:24.705
And the bride's family?

03:24.705 --> 03:26.373
She seems not to have one.

03:26.373 --> 03:27.974
Have you secured
statements from the guests?

03:27.974 --> 03:29.042
-In the process.
-Very good.

03:29.042 --> 03:29.976
The body?

03:29.976 --> 03:31.078
Right through here, sir.

03:33.747 --> 03:35.282
Detective.

03:35.282 --> 03:36.316
Dr. Ogden.

03:36.316 --> 03:38.251
Have you a cause of death?

03:38.251 --> 03:39.586
I can't be sure
until the postmortem,

03:39.586 --> 03:42.055
but it appears to be blunt
force trauma to the head.

03:48.195 --> 03:51.498
Pocket watch has been torn out.

03:51.498 --> 03:52.332
No wallet.

03:56.369 --> 03:59.473
Cufflinks are gone.

03:59.473 --> 04:00.741
Window is open.

04:00.741 --> 04:03.410
Killer likely gained
entry through there.

04:03.410 --> 04:04.377
Murder weapon?

04:04.377 --> 04:06.413
I can't be sure,
but whatever it was,

04:06.413 --> 04:08.081
it caused very
distinctive bruising.

04:08.081 --> 04:10.484
Look, it's a
perfect right angle.

04:10.484 --> 04:13.353
Not so sharp as to incise the
flesh, but enough to shatter

04:13.353 --> 04:14.387
the temporal bone.

04:37.244 --> 04:41.248
It's a perfect match.

04:41.248 --> 04:43.216
It seems nothing is
sacred these days.

04:48.221 --> 04:52.025
How long had you
known Mr. Merrick?

04:52.025 --> 04:53.760
A number of years.

04:53.760 --> 04:55.495
The Merricks are one
of the more prominent

04:55.495 --> 04:57.397
families in the congregation.

04:57.397 --> 04:59.566
And when did you
last see him alive?

04:59.566 --> 05:02.202
Scarcely half an hour before
the body was discovered.

05:02.202 --> 05:05.238
Did you notice anything
out of the ordinary?

05:05.238 --> 05:07.107
Nothing that would
pertain to your--

05:07.107 --> 05:08.975
Reverend, a man
has been killed.

05:08.975 --> 05:11.578
Everything is pertinent.

05:11.578 --> 05:14.347
I overheard Wendell and
his best man arguing.

05:14.347 --> 05:16.416
Do you recall the
nature of this argument?

05:16.416 --> 05:18.185
I couldn't hear clearly.

05:18.185 --> 05:19.085
Why not?

05:19.085 --> 05:22.389
They were in the meeting
room while I was in my office.

05:22.389 --> 05:26.059
And where might I
find the best man?

05:26.059 --> 05:28.395
That would be him over there.

05:28.395 --> 05:31.531
Mr. Lawrence Braxton.

05:31.531 --> 05:33.166
Yes, we argued.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.035
Surely, you don't
think I would kill--

05:35.035 --> 05:39.539
You must realize how
this appears, Mr. Braxton.

05:39.539 --> 05:40.574
I'm sorry.

05:40.574 --> 05:43.009
This has been a brutal shock.

05:43.009 --> 05:44.744
Wendell has been my closest
friend since childhood,

05:44.744 --> 05:50.217
and-- yes, my last
words to him were angry.

05:50.217 --> 05:53.987
What was the argument about?

05:53.987 --> 05:56.323
I wanted him to
call of the wedding.

05:56.323 --> 05:57.157
Why?

05:57.157 --> 05:59.459
Because he didn't love Eunice.

05:59.459 --> 06:02.262
Because this whole
marriage was a contrivance.

06:02.262 --> 06:04.331
For what purpose?

06:04.331 --> 06:06.733
What else?

06:06.733 --> 06:08.468
Money.

06:08.468 --> 06:09.603
Lawrence Braxton?

06:09.603 --> 06:11.438
Why on earth would
you suspect Lawrence?

06:11.438 --> 06:13.306
He and your brother
were overheard arguing

06:13.306 --> 06:14.507
shortly before the murder.

06:14.507 --> 06:17.177
And Mr. Braxton claims
that your brother

06:17.177 --> 06:20.413
was marrying not for love,
but for the family business.

06:20.413 --> 06:21.581
Is this true?

06:21.581 --> 06:23.316
It was a stipulation
of my father's will

06:23.316 --> 06:26.019
that Wendell be married before
he could claim his inheritance.

06:26.019 --> 06:26.686
Why was that?

06:30.357 --> 06:32.359
I loved my brother, Detective.

06:32.359 --> 06:34.761
But Wendell was a gadabout.

06:34.761 --> 06:37.130
There was a genuine fear, and
a legitimate one, I think,

06:37.130 --> 06:38.632
that any money
would be squandered

06:38.632 --> 06:40.267
if it came to him unshackled.

06:40.267 --> 06:43.403
And being married would
have kept him in check?

06:43.403 --> 06:46.573
That's what our parents had
hoped, especially Mother.

06:46.573 --> 06:47.741
How much was he to receive?

06:47.741 --> 06:49.442
Half the family business.

06:49.442 --> 06:50.977
I've already inherited my share.

06:50.977 --> 06:53.013
I see, I see.

06:53.013 --> 06:54.547
Do you know of
anyone who might have

06:54.547 --> 06:55.515
reason to harm your brother?

06:58.351 --> 06:59.653
No one.

06:59.653 --> 07:02.222
Do you recall anything
out of the ordinary?

07:02.222 --> 07:03.056
No.

07:03.056 --> 07:06.159
Well, there was a vagrant
lurking outside the church

07:06.159 --> 07:07.127
just before the wedding.

07:07.127 --> 07:10.597
Your brother was robbed.

07:10.597 --> 07:12.565
Bastard.

07:12.565 --> 07:14.601
One indignity wasn't enough.

07:14.601 --> 07:17.203
I'll need a complete
description of this vagrant,

07:17.203 --> 07:20.173
as well as the valuables that
were on your brother's person.

07:20.173 --> 07:21.007
Of course.

07:34.387 --> 07:36.456
She finally fell asleep.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.425
Poor thing.

07:38.425 --> 07:41.695
Heroin, wonder drug.

07:41.695 --> 07:44.531
Put her right out.

07:44.531 --> 07:48.601
So you knew the deceased well?

07:48.601 --> 07:50.704
Very well.

07:50.704 --> 07:52.272
Since childhood.

07:52.272 --> 07:53.707
And how long have you
known Miss McGinty?

07:53.707 --> 07:55.041
A while now.

07:55.041 --> 07:57.410
I introduced them to
each other, you know?

07:57.410 --> 07:58.478
You introduced them?

08:01.147 --> 08:02.515
Eunice had been
working as a lady's

08:02.515 --> 08:04.417
companion in Niagara Falls.

08:04.417 --> 08:07.587
She moved to Toronto and
started coming to our church.

08:07.587 --> 08:11.358
I felt she and Wendell
would make a good match.

08:11.358 --> 08:12.192
And I was right.

08:12.192 --> 08:13.660
I have never known
a woman to love

08:13.660 --> 08:15.762
a man as she loved Wendell.

08:15.762 --> 08:17.397
So it was a love match?

08:17.397 --> 08:18.431
Well, of course.

08:18.431 --> 08:20.033
What are you insinuating?

08:20.033 --> 08:24.004
He's insinuating I was
after Wendell's money.

08:24.004 --> 08:26.039
I'm sure that the
Detective didn't--

08:26.039 --> 08:28.341
He wouldn't be the first.

08:28.341 --> 08:32.479
Lawrence as much as accused
me of being a gold digger.

08:32.479 --> 08:35.015
Why would he say
such terrible things?

08:35.015 --> 08:36.082
I loved Wendell.

08:43.656 --> 08:48.395
Now the only man who
ever loved me is gone.

09:04.210 --> 09:06.446
Wendell Merrick died of
an extradural hemorrhage

09:06.446 --> 09:09.349
caused by bone fragments
penetrating the temporal lobe.

09:09.349 --> 09:11.484
A lucky blow, or
unlucky, depending

09:11.484 --> 09:12.685
on your point of view.

09:18.391 --> 09:19.592
No, wrong side.

09:28.201 --> 09:30.236
There were no defensive wounds.

09:30.236 --> 09:31.071
Correct.

09:31.071 --> 09:33.173
So the blow was delivered
to the side of the head,

09:33.173 --> 09:34.707
but from behind.

09:34.707 --> 09:38.278
Perhaps the killer
sneaked up on his victim.

09:38.278 --> 09:40.747
Or the victim knew his killer
and was comfortable enough

09:40.747 --> 09:43.016
to turn his back on him.

09:43.016 --> 09:44.084
Anything else?

09:44.084 --> 09:45.485
Traces of semen.

09:45.485 --> 09:47.253
He'd had sexual relations?

09:47.253 --> 09:50.123
Yes, sometime earlier,
before arriving at the church,

09:50.123 --> 09:51.724
I would think.

09:51.724 --> 09:53.193
With a man.

09:53.193 --> 09:54.294
A man?

09:54.294 --> 09:55.995
You're quite sure.

09:55.995 --> 09:57.130
Quite.

09:57.130 --> 09:58.431
He was sodomized?

09:58.431 --> 10:00.233
Well, there was no tearing,
leading me to believe

10:00.233 --> 10:03.436
it was a consensual encounter.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.171
He was a sodomite?

10:05.171 --> 10:11.044
William, I believe the term
now in use is "homosexual."

10:11.044 --> 10:11.978
Mandrakes, eh?

10:11.978 --> 10:13.613
Can't say I'm surprised.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.448
It does explain a few things.

10:15.448 --> 10:16.483
Such as?

10:16.483 --> 10:19.385
Why his parents were so
anxious to marry him off.

10:19.385 --> 10:21.988
Nothing like a sanctified
marriage to remove the whiff

10:21.988 --> 10:24.224
of pansy from the air.

10:24.224 --> 10:26.659
What kind of life would that
be fore the prospective wife?

10:26.659 --> 10:28.528
It's all a trade-off, Murdoch.

10:28.528 --> 10:31.164
A Plain Jane like that doesn't
just up and wed a Merrick.

10:31.164 --> 10:32.365
She knew what she
was getting into.

10:32.365 --> 10:33.199
Perhaps.

10:33.199 --> 10:35.101
Do you think his inclination
was a factor in the murder?

10:35.101 --> 10:36.669
I wouldn't be surprised
if it was the lover

10:36.669 --> 10:38.204
who wielded the weapon.

10:38.204 --> 10:39.472
MURDOCH: The lover?

10:39.472 --> 10:41.241
Well, somebody was
shoving something where

10:41.241 --> 10:42.509
it didn't naturally belong.

10:42.509 --> 10:44.310
And I'm assuming
that that somebody

10:44.310 --> 10:46.012
wasn't too happy about
the upcoming nuptials.

10:46.012 --> 10:48.181
But what about the robbery,
or perhaps even something

10:48.181 --> 10:50.583
to do with Mr.
Merrick's inheritance?

10:50.583 --> 10:52.385
That could be the case.

10:52.385 --> 10:54.654
Listen, I've known a few
shirt-lifters over the years,

10:54.654 --> 10:56.089
and they're a dodgy bunch.

10:56.089 --> 10:57.724
They combine the
vindictive cunning

10:57.724 --> 11:01.327
of a woman scorned with the male
tendency to get the job done.

11:01.327 --> 11:02.162
It's the lover.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.164
I'll lay you even money.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.099
But who's the lover?

11:06.099 --> 11:07.400
You said yourself
that the victim

11:07.400 --> 11:09.035
was arguing with his best pal.

11:09.035 --> 11:12.071
Maybe the two of them were
closer than they let on.

11:12.071 --> 11:14.240
Now, Murdoch, if
you'll just excuse me.

11:14.240 --> 11:16.442
Pressing matters are at hand.

11:16.442 --> 11:18.711
Constable Perkins, a word.

11:23.449 --> 11:24.284
Shut the door.

11:38.431 --> 11:40.033
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

11:40.033 --> 11:41.434
We've been to every
pawn store, sir.

11:41.434 --> 11:42.669
They'll be on the
lookout for the items

11:42.669 --> 11:43.570
stolen from the victim.

11:43.570 --> 11:45.371
Any luck with the vagrant?

11:45.371 --> 11:47.073
Ah, the Reverend Franks said--

11:47.073 --> 11:49.342
(SHOUTING) You're even a
disgrace to the British Empire!

11:49.342 --> 11:51.678
Come in, close
the door, George.

11:51.678 --> 11:54.380
Reverend Franks says there's
a fellow by the name of Old

11:54.380 --> 11:56.149
Dan who likes to beg
around the church,

11:56.149 --> 11:58.685
but we don't know
where he lives.

11:58.685 --> 12:01.054
(SHOUTING) I'm not surprised
you haven't got your badge!

12:01.054 --> 12:02.055
That's with his door closed.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.293
You've just given
me an idea, George.

12:13.399 --> 12:14.701
According to the
Reverend, he couldn't

12:14.701 --> 12:16.502
make out what Mr.
Merrick and his best man

12:16.502 --> 12:18.037
were arguing about.

12:18.037 --> 12:19.072
CRABTREE: What do I say?

12:19.072 --> 12:20.707
Anything, just make it
loud, as though you're

12:20.707 --> 12:21.541
having an argument.

12:21.541 --> 12:22.542
An argument with who?

12:22.542 --> 12:23.977
About what?

12:23.977 --> 12:25.144
Just imagine you're
the Inspector.

12:29.182 --> 12:31.251
Uh.

12:31.251 --> 12:34.487
You bloody, incompetent dog.

12:34.487 --> 12:36.589
How you ever came
to be a policeman

12:36.589 --> 12:40.526
is beyond even my own limited
intelligence to understand.

12:40.526 --> 12:42.295
I'd have you rattling
doorknobs back

12:42.295 --> 12:46.032
in Parkdale if I didn't think
they'd be outsmarting you.

12:46.032 --> 12:48.968
This is the last time you'll
set foot in a police station,

12:48.968 --> 12:52.705
unless it's to be
charged for idiocy.

12:52.705 --> 12:54.641
I'm from Sheffield.

12:54.641 --> 12:57.277
I can't pronounce me L. I
can't pronounce me bloody L's.

12:57.277 --> 12:58.411
Bloody hell.
-George.

12:58.411 --> 12:59.445
George.

12:59.445 --> 13:00.713
That'll do.

13:00.713 --> 13:03.116
Thank you, sir.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.550
That takes some work.

13:04.550 --> 13:05.985
You lied to me, Reverend.

13:05.985 --> 13:07.620
A minister is
obligated to respect

13:07.620 --> 13:09.255
the sanctity of what
passes between him

13:09.255 --> 13:10.623
and his parishioners.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.258
The words in question
were not uttered

13:12.258 --> 13:13.626
between clergyman
and parishioner,

13:13.626 --> 13:15.295
but between two
members of his flock.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.163
The comments were
highly personal,

13:17.163 --> 13:18.631
and they had nothing
to do with the murder.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.400
I will decide that, Reverend.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.467
Now what was said?

13:24.270 --> 13:25.705
Lawrence was upset.

13:25.705 --> 13:27.440
He felt that by
marrying, Wendell

13:27.440 --> 13:29.075
was being untrue to himself.

13:29.075 --> 13:30.510
Because he wasn't
marrying for love.

13:30.510 --> 13:32.278
No.

13:32.278 --> 13:35.648
Because by marrying,
Wendell was in denial

13:35.648 --> 13:37.083
of what he really was.

13:37.083 --> 13:37.750
A sodomite.

13:41.688 --> 13:45.258
But you knew of this already.

13:45.258 --> 13:48.061
Wendell wrestled with his
predilection for years.

13:48.061 --> 13:52.332
I tried to counsel him
as well as I could.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.067
Who was his lover?

13:54.067 --> 13:55.001
Was it Lawrence Braxton?

13:55.001 --> 13:58.338
I cannot, and I will
not say anything more.

14:06.713 --> 14:08.715
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

14:14.687 --> 14:16.055
Detective.

14:16.055 --> 14:19.292
Some new information
has come to light.

14:19.292 --> 14:20.193
Won't you come in?

14:23.730 --> 14:25.998
I think this is a matter
best discussed in private.

14:41.114 --> 14:45.084
Mr. Braxton, what was the
nature of your relationship

14:45.084 --> 14:47.687
with Mr. Merrick?

14:47.687 --> 14:49.989
We were friends.

14:49.989 --> 14:51.257
Nothing more?

14:51.257 --> 14:52.091
What are you implying?

14:54.627 --> 14:56.596
Were you Mr. Merrick's lover?

14:56.596 --> 14:59.232
Good god, man.

14:59.232 --> 15:00.666
I've got a family.

15:00.666 --> 15:05.138
You were aware he
was a homosexual.

15:05.138 --> 15:07.340
Of course, I knew.

15:07.340 --> 15:09.409
I've known since
we were children.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.177
There was something
different about Wendell.

15:11.177 --> 15:14.380
And how did you
feel about this?

15:14.380 --> 15:19.385
Well, the very notion is
difficult to contemplate.

15:19.385 --> 15:22.989
But Wendell was a good man.

15:22.989 --> 15:24.657
You're not suggesting that
his persuasion had something

15:24.657 --> 15:25.658
to do with his murder?

15:25.658 --> 15:28.127
Do you know who his lover was?

15:28.127 --> 15:29.262
No.

15:29.262 --> 15:31.464
Wendell kept that part of
his life separate from me.

15:31.464 --> 15:34.534
And was this the real reason
you were against the marriage?

15:34.534 --> 15:38.171
It had all been so whirlwind.

15:38.171 --> 15:40.606
I didn't feel that
either one of them

15:40.606 --> 15:43.543
really knew what they
were getting into.

15:43.543 --> 15:44.410
Of course, I suspected.

15:47.079 --> 15:50.249
There were times when
things didn't feel right.

15:53.519 --> 15:58.057
The way they should
between a man and a woman.

15:58.057 --> 15:59.559
This is terribly
awkward, Miss McGinty.

15:59.559 --> 16:02.562
so I'll simply say it.

16:02.562 --> 16:06.732
We believe that
Wendell had a lover.

16:06.732 --> 16:08.534
We also believe
that this individual

16:08.534 --> 16:11.471
may be involved in his death.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.272
Have you any idea
who this might be?

16:16.175 --> 16:18.411
Perhaps.

16:18.411 --> 16:20.613
I know this is terribly
difficult, but, please,

16:20.613 --> 16:22.548
if you have any idea who he is.

16:26.419 --> 16:28.588
I know the groom isn't
supposed to see the bride

16:28.588 --> 16:31.491
before the wedding,
but I needed to know

16:31.491 --> 16:33.159
everything was all right.

16:33.159 --> 16:35.228
So when Daisy was
powdering herself,

16:35.228 --> 16:39.332
I went to find Wendell.

16:39.332 --> 16:42.602
That's when I saw them.

16:42.602 --> 16:45.371
Saw who, Miss McGinty?

16:45.371 --> 16:47.373
Wendell and Reverend Franks.

16:50.343 --> 16:51.344
They were kissing.

17:05.658 --> 17:07.593
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

17:07.593 --> 17:11.297
It's been six days since
my last confession.

17:11.297 --> 17:13.766
PRIEST: Most unlike
you, William.

17:13.766 --> 17:16.969
I've been somewhat distracted.

17:16.969 --> 17:21.007
PRIEST: You must always
make time for the Lord.

17:21.007 --> 17:22.742
Father, I must question
a man of the cloth

17:22.742 --> 17:25.645
on matters of a criminal nature.

17:25.645 --> 17:28.147
No man is above the law.

17:28.147 --> 17:32.218
His crimes may not only
be against the laws of man.

17:32.218 --> 17:33.986
What has he done?

17:33.986 --> 17:37.256
He's-- he may be a sodomite.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.161
That is a very grave sin.

17:42.161 --> 17:45.431
Should he prove not guilty of
the earthly crimes, must his

17:45.431 --> 17:46.732
congregation be made aware--

17:46.732 --> 17:49.669
"If a man also lie
with mankind as he

17:49.669 --> 17:54.974
lieth with a woman, both of them
have committed an abomination."

17:54.974 --> 17:58.010
William, the Bible is
clear on this matter.

17:58.010 --> 18:00.379
Let the Word of
the Lord guide you.

18:00.379 --> 18:03.416
Say two rosaries and
reflect on this matter.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.284
In the name of the
Father, and of the Son,

18:05.284 --> 18:06.218
and of the Holy Spirit.

18:06.218 --> 18:07.053
Amen.

18:07.053 --> 18:07.687
Amen.

18:10.623 --> 18:13.025
Poor Eunice was overwrought.

18:13.025 --> 18:14.727
She misinterpreted what she saw.

18:14.727 --> 18:16.062
And what was that?

18:16.062 --> 18:19.198
A clergyman offering solace
to a member of his flock.

18:19.198 --> 18:21.667
Solace for what?

18:21.667 --> 18:23.703
Wendell had decided
that he could not

18:23.703 --> 18:25.304
go through with the wedding.

18:25.304 --> 18:28.341
That it was unfair to
both Eunice and himself.

18:28.341 --> 18:31.277
So he came to you for counsel.

18:31.277 --> 18:32.745
He knew that it would
utterly destroy both

18:32.745 --> 18:35.615
his fiancee and his mother.

18:35.615 --> 18:39.118
Yet he felt it was
something he had to do.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.620
And this solace,
as you call it--

18:40.620 --> 18:43.689
did it take a physical form?

18:43.689 --> 18:45.024
He was shaking.

18:45.024 --> 18:46.425
I embraced him to calm him.

18:46.425 --> 18:47.693
I daresay you'd
have done the same.

18:47.693 --> 18:49.528
Well, an embrace is one thing.

18:49.528 --> 18:52.131
But kissing's an entirely
different matter.

18:52.131 --> 18:55.167
If I kissed him, it was a
brotherly kiss on the cheek.

18:55.167 --> 18:57.269
Is that what passes
for brotherly comfort

18:57.269 --> 18:59.305
in your church, Reverend?

18:59.305 --> 19:01.173
Or is it something worse?

19:01.173 --> 19:03.476
Are you a sodomite?

19:03.476 --> 19:04.610
Were you Wendell
Merrick's lover?

19:04.610 --> 19:08.514
How dare you accuse
me of such things.

19:08.514 --> 19:12.451
In the eyes of the Lord,
that act is an abomination.

19:12.451 --> 19:13.586
I would never betray my God.

19:16.222 --> 19:19.125
So now the minister could
be a handbag as well, eh?

19:19.125 --> 19:21.127
You'll soon be seeing mandrakes
in your sleep, Murdoch.

19:21.127 --> 19:23.462
They were seen kissing just
shortly before the murder.

19:23.462 --> 19:24.530
But is he the lover?

19:24.530 --> 19:25.364
I don't know.

19:25.364 --> 19:26.465
Well then, find out.

19:26.465 --> 19:27.700
But how, sir?

19:27.700 --> 19:29.669
If they were involved, their
relationship would have

19:29.669 --> 19:31.303
been a closely guarded secret.

19:31.303 --> 19:32.371
To the public, yes.

19:32.371 --> 19:35.641
But these people have
their own societies.

19:35.641 --> 19:38.644
I think the thing for you to do
is to sidle up to a few Marys.

19:38.644 --> 19:39.478
How?

19:39.478 --> 19:41.013
Beat the bushes down
at Cherry Beach?

19:41.013 --> 19:42.214
No, no, no.

19:42.214 --> 19:44.216
If you want to catch
a bender with class,

19:44.216 --> 19:45.651
upper-crust mandrakes
like Wendell Merrick

19:45.651 --> 19:46.752
have their own clubs.

19:46.752 --> 19:47.586
What clubs?

19:47.586 --> 19:48.421
It varies.

19:48.421 --> 19:49.488
What day is it today?

19:49.488 --> 19:50.322
Monday.

19:50.322 --> 19:51.190
Monday.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.591
They used to meet on
Mondays in the guise

19:52.591 --> 19:54.994
of literary appreciation.

19:54.994 --> 19:56.162
Oi, Higgins.

19:56.162 --> 19:58.597
What ever happened to that
Monday afternoon pansy club?

19:58.597 --> 20:00.433
Do they still meet in the
back room at the Dominion?

20:00.433 --> 20:02.535
Not after that last raid, sir.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.704
I believe they're at the
Taylor Creek Tennis Club now.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.739
Ah, you see, that's the problem
with catching these mollies.

20:06.739 --> 20:09.375
You swat them here,
and they pop up there.

20:09.375 --> 20:10.376
How does Higgins know this?

20:10.376 --> 20:12.278
Well, between you and
me, he has a cousin

20:12.278 --> 20:15.548
who's a bit of a left-footer.

20:15.548 --> 20:18.050
But you won't pass for one
looking like that though.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.019
Pass for one?

20:20.019 --> 20:21.587
Yes, not bad, not bad.

20:21.587 --> 20:22.521
Uh.

20:22.521 --> 20:25.124
We may have gone a touch
overboard with the feathers.

20:25.124 --> 20:26.092
There you go.

20:26.092 --> 20:27.026
Right then.

20:27.026 --> 20:28.661
Pansy, who's got the pansy?

20:28.661 --> 20:31.130
Of course, Higgins.

20:31.130 --> 20:32.164
Did you get it off your cousin?

20:32.164 --> 20:34.500
[LAUGHTER]

20:34.500 --> 20:39.004
Pansies, symbol of
fairies the world over.

20:39.004 --> 20:42.174
Now remember, don't
overplay your hand.

20:42.174 --> 20:43.309
Be subtle.

20:43.309 --> 20:46.479
Let your quarry
make the first move.

20:46.479 --> 20:49.682
Your racket, sir.

20:49.682 --> 20:51.550
Show us your swing.

20:51.550 --> 20:53.185
I beg your pardon.

20:53.185 --> 20:54.186
Your tennis swing.

20:54.186 --> 20:55.020
Let's see it.

20:59.992 --> 21:00.626
You'll be fine.

21:00.626 --> 21:03.162
[LAUGHTER]

21:16.175 --> 21:18.043
JEFFREY: It's a sad time.

21:18.043 --> 21:21.247
I choose to remember
him for who he was.

21:21.247 --> 21:25.718
He was warm, gentle, and
generous in every way,

21:25.718 --> 21:29.188
and not afraid, even
in the face of the most

21:29.188 --> 21:32.391
withering scorn, of
expressing his sincere

21:32.391 --> 21:36.595
appreciation of Spanish wine.

21:36.595 --> 21:40.432
So, gentlemen, I'd like
you to join me in tossing

21:40.432 --> 21:43.569
a little Rioja past the gums.

21:43.569 --> 21:45.004
To Wendall Merrick.

21:45.004 --> 21:46.205
MAN: To Wendell.
MAN: To Wendell.

21:46.205 --> 21:47.072
MAN: To Wendell.

21:49.275 --> 21:50.576
Ah, thank you for coming.

21:50.576 --> 21:53.746
Here, let's talk.

21:53.746 --> 21:55.748
Well put.

21:55.748 --> 21:57.516
Thank you.

21:57.516 --> 22:00.686
Um, did you know Wendell?

22:00.686 --> 22:01.720
A bit.

22:01.720 --> 22:04.089
Obviously, not as
well as you did.

22:04.089 --> 22:04.723
Yes.

22:04.723 --> 22:07.126
He was a good friend.

22:07.126 --> 22:09.228
I was devastated to
learn what happened.

22:12.198 --> 22:14.600
Jeffrey.

22:14.600 --> 22:15.668
George.

22:15.668 --> 22:16.535
George Crabtree.

22:20.539 --> 22:21.373
You're new?

22:24.076 --> 22:26.712
Yes.

22:26.712 --> 22:30.149
How did hear about us?

22:30.149 --> 22:31.584
We try to keep a low profile.

22:31.584 --> 22:33.519
Through a friend in Montreal.

22:33.519 --> 22:34.720
I see.

22:34.720 --> 22:37.756
Just who is this friend?

22:37.756 --> 22:42.494
We, in Montreal, also
like to keep a low profile.

22:42.494 --> 22:44.330
Understood.

22:44.330 --> 22:50.169
But I must say, the outfit
is hardly low-profile.

22:50.169 --> 22:53.172
You look like Oscar Wilde.

22:53.172 --> 22:54.340
If Oscar Wilde
were good-looking.

22:57.743 --> 23:00.079
So you know this crowd well?

23:00.079 --> 23:01.247
Yes.

23:01.247 --> 23:03.048
We're all regulars.

23:03.048 --> 23:05.684
So there's no need
to be concerned.

23:05.684 --> 23:07.353
What happens inside
stays inside.

23:12.458 --> 23:13.726
You've never done this before.

23:18.163 --> 23:21.033
No.

23:21.033 --> 23:22.735
Then welcome.

23:22.735 --> 23:24.436
Truly.

23:24.436 --> 23:28.173
It takes a lot of courage
to come here like this.

23:32.144 --> 23:34.146
You're trembling.

23:34.146 --> 23:38.484
Yes, well, perhaps
I am a bit nervous.

23:38.484 --> 23:42.421
It happens to us all.

23:42.421 --> 23:44.156
Would you like to
go someplace private?

23:47.359 --> 23:49.561
I have this cozy little
place in Corktown.

23:56.035 --> 23:56.702
I don't play doubles.

23:59.371 --> 24:00.205
Hey.

24:07.179 --> 24:08.047
Bastard.

24:13.319 --> 24:14.486
Do you recognize this man?

24:17.389 --> 24:19.625
Have you ever seen him at
the club with Mr. Merrick?

24:23.228 --> 24:26.665
I could have you charged
with indecency, sir.

24:26.665 --> 24:29.568
I don't know what you're
talking about, Detective.

24:29.568 --> 24:31.303
You propositioned me.

24:31.303 --> 24:32.338
No.

24:32.338 --> 24:35.040
You propositioned me.

24:35.040 --> 24:39.411
In fact, you came off
remarkably believable.

24:39.411 --> 24:40.546
Just tell me if
you've ever seen

24:40.546 --> 24:42.214
this man at any of your events.

24:42.214 --> 24:43.415
Why?

24:43.415 --> 24:44.984
So you can conduct a witch hunt?

24:44.984 --> 24:46.151
I think not.

24:46.151 --> 24:47.619
[KNOCK ON WINDOW]

24:54.360 --> 24:55.194
So that's the bender?

24:55.194 --> 24:56.028
Mm.

24:56.028 --> 24:57.029
But he's somewhat reticent.

24:57.029 --> 24:58.230
Oh, really?

24:58.230 --> 24:59.665
I can handle this, Inspector.

24:59.665 --> 25:02.101
Don't tell me you're going
soft on this lot, Murdoch.

25:02.101 --> 25:03.702
I just think that if
I talk to him, I'll--

25:03.702 --> 25:04.670
Talk?

25:04.670 --> 25:06.538
[LAUGH]

25:10.709 --> 25:14.346
So, Jeffrey.

25:14.346 --> 25:17.683
Take a very good look
at this photograph.

25:17.683 --> 25:19.985
Now tell me, do you
recognize this man?

25:30.129 --> 25:32.498
So Jeffrey.

25:32.498 --> 25:36.001
[CRASHING]

25:36.568 --> 25:37.403
JEFFREY: Ah!

25:43.709 --> 25:47.212
The good reverend is a pansy.

25:47.212 --> 25:48.047
I see.

25:48.047 --> 25:50.315
But he's definitely not
Wendell Merrick's lover.

25:50.315 --> 25:51.450
Would you like to know who is?

25:51.450 --> 25:54.153
Our friend and family
man, Lawrence Braxton.

26:02.261 --> 26:04.430
Come in, Detective.

26:04.430 --> 26:07.166
Mrs. Braxton, I'd like to
speak with your husband, please.

26:07.166 --> 26:09.201
Is everything all right?

26:09.201 --> 26:11.170
I just need to speak
with him, thank you.

26:11.170 --> 26:12.004
He's upstairs.

26:14.973 --> 26:16.175
Lawrence.

26:16.175 --> 26:18.977
Detective Murdoch
is here to see you.

26:18.977 --> 26:19.611
Lawrence?

26:22.047 --> 26:22.714
That's strange.

26:22.714 --> 26:24.216
I know he's up there.

26:24.216 --> 26:25.084
May I?

26:25.084 --> 26:25.717
Of course.

26:36.095 --> 26:37.463
Lawrence.

26:37.463 --> 26:38.464
Oh my god!

26:46.438 --> 26:48.540
Our marriage wasn't perfect.

26:48.540 --> 26:52.010
But Lawrence loved his child.

26:52.010 --> 26:53.345
And me.

26:53.345 --> 26:55.614
In his own way.

26:55.614 --> 26:59.318
So your marriage
was an arrangement.

26:59.318 --> 27:00.152
An understanding.

27:03.055 --> 27:05.624
Lawrence had safety.

27:05.624 --> 27:08.360
And in turn, I had
a child and a home.

27:11.196 --> 27:13.999
He kept his affairs discreet.

27:13.999 --> 27:16.401
I chose not to press.

27:16.401 --> 27:19.304
Did you know of Lawrence's
involvement with Wendell?

27:19.304 --> 27:20.139
I suspected.

27:22.641 --> 27:25.511
Is it possible your husband
killed Wendell Merrick?

27:25.511 --> 27:27.546
No, he loved Wendell.

27:27.546 --> 27:28.380
I'm sure of that.

27:28.380 --> 27:30.082
He would never harm him.

27:36.021 --> 27:39.558
Preliminary findings, Doctor?

27:39.558 --> 27:41.360
Petechial hemorrhaging.

27:41.360 --> 27:43.662
There's one set
of ligature marks.

27:43.662 --> 27:45.097
It would seem to
be self-inflicted

27:45.097 --> 27:46.498
death by hanging.

27:46.498 --> 27:51.103
He had a beautiful
home, wife, child.

27:51.103 --> 27:52.371
Not only does he
throw all of that

27:52.371 --> 27:55.140
away, but condemns himself
to eternal damnation

27:55.140 --> 27:57.276
by committing suicide.

27:57.276 --> 27:59.211
Perhaps he felt that hell
was no worse than the torment

27:59.211 --> 28:01.113
he was living in.

28:01.113 --> 28:01.747
There's always hope.

28:05.083 --> 28:07.553
He was living a sham.

28:07.553 --> 28:09.655
Everything was a lie.

28:09.655 --> 28:11.757
Secretly, he was in love with
someone he could never be with.

28:11.757 --> 28:14.393
And furthermore, that person
was about to marry someone else.

28:14.393 --> 28:17.229
Yes, but to kill himself?

28:17.229 --> 28:19.031
Really, William.

28:19.031 --> 28:20.666
I'm surprised at your
closed-mindedness.

28:20.666 --> 28:22.100
Even leaving the Bible aside--

28:22.100 --> 28:24.436
Yes, could we?

28:24.436 --> 28:25.637
It goes against nature.

28:25.637 --> 28:26.471
Oh, rubbish.

28:29.374 --> 28:31.543
Nature is full of
omnisexual behavior.

28:31.543 --> 28:34.379
Have you never seen
male dogs at play?

28:34.379 --> 28:35.581
But those are dogs.

28:35.581 --> 28:40.185
We're all animals, William,
behaving as nature intended.

28:40.185 --> 28:42.487
If God didn't want us
to express our desires,

28:42.487 --> 28:47.059
then why would He give us
desires in the first place?

28:47.059 --> 28:48.493
To test our resolve.

28:48.493 --> 28:51.063
At whose expense?

28:51.063 --> 28:53.232
Surely, this is not God's plan.

29:02.674 --> 29:04.710
Of course, the
wife will say that.

29:04.710 --> 29:07.546
No woman wants to believe her
husband's capable of murder.

29:07.546 --> 29:10.148
But his swinging body's
almost a signed confession.

29:10.148 --> 29:12.050
I hardly think that's true.

29:12.050 --> 29:15.587
He knew we were closing in,
so he took the easy way out.

29:15.587 --> 29:19.091
Lawrence Braxton
loved Wendell Merrick.

29:19.091 --> 29:21.226
You can never do it the
easy way, can you, Murdoch?

29:21.226 --> 29:22.494
Sir, I believe
this investigation

29:22.494 --> 29:24.229
has been sidetracked.

29:24.229 --> 29:25.097
BRACKENREID: Sidetracked?

29:25.097 --> 29:26.131
How?

29:26.131 --> 29:28.166
I think the victim's
homosexuality

29:28.166 --> 29:31.570
has caused us not to pursue
other viable theories.

29:31.570 --> 29:33.238
I see.

29:33.238 --> 29:35.207
And these other theories?

29:35.207 --> 29:37.509
Like I said before--
robbery gone wrong

29:37.509 --> 29:39.378
or something to do with
the victim's inheritance.

29:39.378 --> 29:41.213
Listen to me.

29:41.213 --> 29:42.648
Braxton's our boy.

29:42.648 --> 29:43.482
End of.

29:47.753 --> 29:48.754
Sir?

29:48.754 --> 29:50.455
We have found the vagrant.

29:50.455 --> 29:54.726
Oh, and Thomas Merrick is
on his way to identify him.

29:54.726 --> 29:56.662
They're mine.

29:56.662 --> 29:58.630
This belonged to my
dear dead father.

30:01.300 --> 30:06.171
This was given to me upon
my retirement from the Navy.

30:06.171 --> 30:09.341
These, ah, now these are
a story to themselves.

30:09.341 --> 30:11.143
They were given to me
by the Duke of Cornwall

30:11.143 --> 30:13.578
as a reward for saving the
virtue of his daughter.

30:13.578 --> 30:15.280
And after all these
years of carrying

30:15.280 --> 30:16.581
these valuable items
around with you,

30:16.581 --> 30:20.385
you suddenly decide
to pawn them all.

30:20.385 --> 30:22.654
I've fallen on hard times.

30:22.654 --> 30:24.056
Do you know why you're here?

30:24.056 --> 30:26.291
Oh, you think I nicked
these things, but I swear--

30:26.291 --> 30:27.592
You're not here for theft.

30:27.592 --> 30:28.460
You're here for murder.

30:31.163 --> 30:33.665
M-- murder?

30:33.665 --> 30:35.467
I may be a lot of things,
but I'm no murderer.

30:35.467 --> 30:37.269
These items were
taken from a man

30:37.269 --> 30:38.970
who was found murdered
yesterday morning

30:38.970 --> 30:40.339
in Shuter Street Church.
-Oh, no, no.

30:40.339 --> 30:41.173
It wasn't me.

30:41.173 --> 30:42.507
You were spotted at the scene.

30:42.507 --> 30:43.709
Oh, no, no, I
mean, it wasn't me.

30:43.709 --> 30:44.543
It couldn't be me.

30:44.543 --> 30:48.513
Then tell me truthfully
what happened.

30:48.513 --> 30:49.381
I found them.

30:49.381 --> 30:50.349
Where?

30:50.349 --> 30:52.017
Outside the church.

30:52.017 --> 30:54.986
I mean, some bloke, he chucked
them outside the window.

30:54.986 --> 30:57.689
I swear.

30:57.689 --> 31:00.692
Ah, Mr. Merrick, thank
you for coming down.

31:00.692 --> 31:02.561
Do you recognize this man?

31:02.561 --> 31:03.562
I know you.

31:03.562 --> 31:05.263
This is the vagrant I
saw outside of the church.

31:05.263 --> 31:06.531
No.

31:06.531 --> 31:09.167
You're the fella who
chucked these things

31:09.167 --> 31:10.001
outside the window.

31:17.442 --> 31:20.445
THOMAS: You take the word of
a derelict boozer over mine?

31:20.445 --> 31:22.381
Why would he identify you?

31:22.381 --> 31:26.718
He just wants to point the
finger at somebody, anybody.

31:26.718 --> 31:30.055
Mr. Merrick, were you
jealous of your brother?

31:30.055 --> 31:30.689
What?

31:30.689 --> 31:32.190
Hardly seems fair.

31:32.190 --> 31:33.458
A gadabout like your
brother inheriting

31:33.458 --> 31:36.361
half the family business
just for marrying a girl.

31:36.361 --> 31:38.330
Are you implying that
I killed my brother?

31:38.330 --> 31:40.699
Then you took his valuables
to make it look like a robbery.

31:40.699 --> 31:42.467
I was nowhere near that room.

31:42.467 --> 31:43.335
Odd.

31:43.335 --> 31:45.103
You claim to have been
searching for your brother

31:45.103 --> 31:49.007
shortly before the
ceremony, Mr. Merrick.

31:49.007 --> 31:51.443
Are you familiar
with finger marks?

31:51.443 --> 31:52.544
Excuse me?

31:52.544 --> 31:54.646
They're the prints that your
oily fingers leave behind

31:54.646 --> 31:55.614
when you touch something.

31:55.614 --> 31:57.616
Quite handy for investigations.

31:57.616 --> 32:00.285
You see, no two are alike.

32:00.285 --> 32:03.455
Do you think if I checked
this watch and cufflinks,

32:03.455 --> 32:04.990
I might find your finger marks?

32:07.993 --> 32:09.995
All right.

32:09.995 --> 32:11.596
I was in the room.

32:11.596 --> 32:14.332
What happened?

32:14.332 --> 32:16.701
I wanted to make sure
that Wendell was all right.

32:16.701 --> 32:20.439
But I swear to God,
I did not kill him.

32:20.439 --> 32:24.242
He was lying there, and I
just knew it had something

32:24.242 --> 32:26.411
to do with his deviance.

32:26.411 --> 32:27.612
So you knew?

32:27.612 --> 32:29.214
Of course, I knew.

32:29.214 --> 32:30.682
The whole family knew.

32:30.682 --> 32:33.485
Is that why your mother
bribed him to get married?

32:33.485 --> 32:38.089
That's a crude way of
putting it, but yes.

32:38.089 --> 32:40.692
Continue.

32:40.692 --> 32:43.261
It was clear that
he'd been murdered.

32:43.261 --> 32:44.729
I knew if the
police investigated,

32:44.729 --> 32:45.664
the truth would come out.

32:45.664 --> 32:48.533
So you took his valuables,
threw them out the window

32:48.533 --> 32:50.068
so that it would
look like robbery.

32:50.068 --> 32:51.436
I'd seen the beggar earlier.

32:51.436 --> 32:52.270
I thought--

32:52.270 --> 32:53.538
What?

32:53.538 --> 32:55.073
We would just assume it was him?

32:59.277 --> 33:02.047
So you re-entered the room
and pretended to discover

33:02.047 --> 33:02.747
your brother's body?

33:02.747 --> 33:04.749
I had to do it.

33:04.749 --> 33:07.185
It could've ruined our family.

33:07.185 --> 33:09.621
That would have been a tragedy.

33:09.621 --> 33:12.224
Yes, Detective, it would have.

33:26.471 --> 33:29.608
So you're still here?

33:29.608 --> 33:30.575
Yes.

33:30.575 --> 33:32.110
But I'm not having any success.

33:34.579 --> 33:37.449
According to the papers,
the case is closed.

33:37.449 --> 33:40.285
"Lover murders groom
on wedding day."

33:40.285 --> 33:43.021
That's the Inspector's opinion.

33:43.021 --> 33:45.023
Not yours, I take it.

33:45.023 --> 33:46.992
I keep wondering
why Lawrence Braxton

33:46.992 --> 33:50.228
would kill the man he loves.

33:50.228 --> 33:51.196
That's a very good question.

33:53.665 --> 33:56.635
Doctor, I must tell you, the
circumstances around this case

33:56.635 --> 34:01.139
have been very difficult for me.

34:01.139 --> 34:06.611
They go against my upbringing,
my education, my beliefs.

34:06.611 --> 34:07.445
Really?

34:12.684 --> 34:15.120
I brought you the final
results of Lawrence

34:15.120 --> 34:17.389
Braxton's postmortem.

34:17.389 --> 34:18.557
Anything out of the ordinary?

34:18.557 --> 34:20.425
Nothing we're not aware of.

34:25.564 --> 34:27.699
Doctor.

34:27.699 --> 34:29.434
If he were the killer,
why would Lawrence

34:29.434 --> 34:31.269
Braxton wait until
the day of the wedding

34:31.269 --> 34:34.139
to kill Mr. Merrick?

34:34.139 --> 34:37.042
Perhaps it was a
true crime of passion.

34:37.042 --> 34:38.109
He didn't plan to kill Wendell.

34:38.109 --> 34:40.478
He just-- he was upset.

34:40.478 --> 34:42.247
But that is where
I have the problem.

34:42.247 --> 34:44.382
They would have both been
in marriages of convenience.

34:44.382 --> 34:46.585
Nothing in their relationship
would have changed.

34:46.585 --> 34:47.586
Then why was he killed?

34:47.586 --> 34:50.589
It's usually always
about love or money.

34:50.589 --> 34:51.756
You seem to be eliminating love.

34:51.756 --> 34:53.291
And it wasn't robbery.

34:53.291 --> 34:55.160
I've also eliminated that.

34:55.160 --> 34:56.428
That only leaves inheritance.

34:56.428 --> 34:57.629
And who would've stood to gain?

34:57.629 --> 34:58.496
His brother?

34:58.496 --> 35:01.199
Eventually, but only
after the mother died.

35:01.199 --> 35:02.434
And the bride would
only have received

35:02.434 --> 35:04.235
her share if the marriage
had been completed.

35:07.005 --> 35:08.573
Yes.

35:08.573 --> 35:10.575
If the marriage
had been completed.

35:14.512 --> 35:15.513
You're welcome.

35:27.759 --> 35:30.629
Have you come to make
it a matching set?

35:30.629 --> 35:31.463
MURDOCH: I'm sorry?

35:36.668 --> 35:39.571
No.

35:39.571 --> 35:41.439
I've come to ask for your help.

35:41.439 --> 35:42.607
My help?

35:42.607 --> 35:45.010
The last time I
told you anything,

35:45.010 --> 35:47.545
Lawrence ended up dead.

35:47.545 --> 35:51.016
Neither of us can
undo what's happened.

35:51.016 --> 35:53.318
But we still have a chance
to at least make it right.

35:57.255 --> 35:58.356
I've already told
you everything

35:58.356 --> 35:59.391
I know about Wendell.

35:59.391 --> 36:02.727
It's Lawrence that
I want to know about.

36:02.727 --> 36:04.329
What about him?

36:04.329 --> 36:06.398
Did he ever discuss
Wendell's wedding with you?

36:06.398 --> 36:09.567
Lawrence once told
me he was worried.

36:09.567 --> 36:11.236
What about?

36:11.236 --> 36:13.571
Well, he felt that Wendell
was getting to the marriage

36:13.571 --> 36:15.273
too quickly.
-Why?

36:15.273 --> 36:16.174
What was bothering him?

36:16.174 --> 36:18.376
He felt that Wendell didn't
know enough about his bride.

36:18.376 --> 36:19.310
MURDOCH: Miss McGinty?

36:19.310 --> 36:20.745
Yes.

36:20.745 --> 36:23.181
Lawrence felt that
she was a cipher.

36:23.181 --> 36:24.282
Did you ever meet her?

36:24.282 --> 36:25.150
Once.

36:25.150 --> 36:28.153
She seemed like a
dowdy little thing.

36:28.153 --> 36:29.688
And how did Wendell
feel about her?

36:29.688 --> 36:32.557
Oh, he just wanted to
get the whole ordeal over

36:32.557 --> 36:33.425
and done with.

36:33.425 --> 36:36.127
So he was predisposed
to marrying?

36:36.127 --> 36:38.496
Not her specifically.

36:38.496 --> 36:40.031
The truth is he
would have married

36:40.031 --> 36:44.536
virtually anyone to get that
hideous mother off his back.

36:44.536 --> 36:46.071
Thank you very much, Jeffrey.

36:46.071 --> 36:47.372
You've been most helpful.

36:47.372 --> 36:49.174
[KNOCK ON GLASS]
Driver, pull over.

36:49.174 --> 36:51.710
DRIVER: Yes, sir.

36:51.710 --> 36:54.212
Jeffrey.

36:54.212 --> 36:56.247
If I were you, I
wouldn't play any more

36:56.247 --> 36:58.683
tennis on Monday evenings.

36:58.683 --> 37:00.418
In fact, I think
your entire group

37:00.418 --> 37:01.720
should take up another sport.

37:14.566 --> 37:17.035
I don't know what more
I can add, Detective.

37:17.035 --> 37:18.603
Eunice and I met at the church.

37:18.603 --> 37:20.405
There was nothing odd about it.

37:20.405 --> 37:23.575
Would you mind telling me
exactly how you two met?

37:23.575 --> 37:26.144
It was a strawberry social.

37:26.144 --> 37:28.346
Thomas introduced us.

37:28.346 --> 37:29.180
Thomas?

37:29.180 --> 37:30.014
I see.

37:30.014 --> 37:32.650
And how had he met Miss McGinty?

37:32.650 --> 37:34.452
I don't know.

37:34.452 --> 37:36.121
Did you know at this
point that Wendell

37:36.121 --> 37:37.455
was looking for a bride?

37:37.455 --> 37:40.058
Yes, Wendall told
me very early on.

37:40.058 --> 37:42.393
Then Thomas came to me
to ask for help as well.

37:42.393 --> 37:43.228
Had he?

37:43.228 --> 37:44.329
Yes.

37:44.329 --> 37:46.297
As I got to know
her I realized this

37:46.297 --> 37:49.567
was perfect for bundle constant

37:49.567 --> 37:51.302
Yes, clearly.

37:51.302 --> 37:54.506
You told me earlier that
she was from Niagara Falls.

37:54.506 --> 37:55.974
Do you recall the
name of her employer?

37:59.077 --> 38:01.346
A Mrs. Schreyer.

38:01.346 --> 38:02.447
Mrs. Schreyer.

38:02.447 --> 38:04.282
Schreyer.

38:04.282 --> 38:06.484
What do you mean we've been
looking at this case all wrong?

38:06.484 --> 38:08.153
We've been working
under the assumption

38:08.153 --> 38:09.420
that whoever killed
Wendell Merrick

38:09.420 --> 38:11.456
stood to profit from his death.

38:11.456 --> 38:13.324
But just how else is
there to look at it?

38:13.324 --> 38:14.559
Well, sir, consider this.

38:14.559 --> 38:17.162
What if it's the timing
of the murder that's off.

38:17.162 --> 38:18.396
Off?

38:18.396 --> 38:20.732
You mean he was to be
killed after the wedding?

38:20.732 --> 38:21.699
Yes.

38:21.699 --> 38:24.068
Who would've stood to gain then?

38:24.068 --> 38:26.738
I suppose we'd be taking a very
close look at his new bride.

38:26.738 --> 38:28.473
Precisely.

38:28.473 --> 38:30.241
Now no one seems
to know anything

38:30.241 --> 38:31.576
about her past to speak of.

38:31.576 --> 38:33.378
As well, sir,
there's the timing.

38:33.378 --> 38:37.015
She enters the victim's life at
virtually the perfect moment.

38:37.015 --> 38:39.117
All right, I'll grant you that
could all be construed as a bit

38:39.117 --> 38:41.419
dodgy, but the facts
remain that Merrick's dead,

38:41.419 --> 38:43.755
and his bride didn't
get the inheritance.

38:43.755 --> 38:45.557
What if something went
wrong with the plan?

38:45.557 --> 38:46.991
Such as?

38:46.991 --> 38:49.060
Wendell Merrick
caught wind of it.

38:49.060 --> 38:51.729
Forcing the killer's hand.

38:51.729 --> 38:52.997
That's a lot of "ifs," Murdoch.

38:52.997 --> 38:56.201
Yes, well, what if I find out
more about this Eunice McGinty?

38:56.201 --> 38:59.337
Perhaps that will
lead us to the truth.

38:59.337 --> 39:01.039
Get yourself a train
ticket to Niagara Falls

39:01.039 --> 39:03.107
and see what her former
employer has to say.

39:03.107 --> 39:04.209
Yes, sir.

39:04.209 --> 39:07.212
Oh, and, Murdoch,
make that coach class.

39:16.020 --> 39:17.989
SCHREYER: Oh, my.

39:17.989 --> 39:21.059
Eunice was such a
dear girl, Detective.

39:21.059 --> 39:23.461
And how long did she work
for you, Mrs. Schreyer?

39:23.461 --> 39:25.630
Almost three years.

39:25.630 --> 39:27.131
What was she like?

39:27.131 --> 39:29.300
She's quiet, unassuming.

39:29.300 --> 39:32.003
You know, I don't think
she ever got over the fact

39:32.003 --> 39:34.105
that her parents died.

39:34.105 --> 39:35.173
She was an only child?

39:35.173 --> 39:36.007
Yes.

39:36.007 --> 39:37.709
So incredibly lonely.

39:37.709 --> 39:41.279
I always think that's
why she did it.

39:41.279 --> 39:42.614
Did what?

39:42.614 --> 39:47.252
Why she jumped into the
gorge, just below the falls.

39:47.252 --> 39:48.486
She's dead?

39:48.486 --> 39:49.554
Yes, six months.

39:49.554 --> 39:52.290
Didn't you know?

39:52.290 --> 39:54.626
Mrs. Schreyer, do you
recognize this woman?

39:54.626 --> 39:56.561
Oh, why yes.

39:56.561 --> 39:58.062
MURDOCH: Eunice McGinty?

39:58.062 --> 39:59.030
Heavens, no.

39:59.030 --> 40:00.698
That is Bridget Kline.

40:00.698 --> 40:02.200
Bridget Kline?

40:02.200 --> 40:05.103
Bridget and Eunice worked
together at the house.

40:05.103 --> 40:08.239
In fact, Bridget was with
Eunice when she jumped.

40:08.239 --> 40:09.707
Was she?

40:09.707 --> 40:11.509
Do you know where
Bridget is now?

40:11.509 --> 40:15.280
She moved away to Toronto
after the whole terrible affair.

40:15.280 --> 40:16.481
Do you know why?

40:16.481 --> 40:17.548
Bad memories.

40:17.548 --> 40:20.985
I suppose she wanted to
be closer to her fellow.

40:20.985 --> 40:22.053
And who was that?

40:22.053 --> 40:23.288
Oh, I can't remember his name.

40:23.288 --> 40:27.258
I can't be sure, but I think
he owned some kind of company.

40:27.258 --> 40:30.194
His name didn't happen to
be Thomas Merrick, did it?

40:30.194 --> 40:33.364
Yes, that's it.

40:33.364 --> 40:34.299
It's quite lovely.

40:34.299 --> 40:35.133
Thank you.

40:42.006 --> 40:45.076
Miss McGinty.

40:45.076 --> 40:49.013
My, you've undergone
quite a transformation.

40:49.013 --> 40:51.683
Can't a girl fix herself up?

40:51.683 --> 40:53.751
Are you planning a trip?

40:53.751 --> 40:56.521
Yes, I needed to get away
from this horrible situation.

40:56.521 --> 40:57.555
I'm sure you understand.

40:57.555 --> 40:59.090
Yes, yes, of course.

40:59.090 --> 41:01.759
I've just returned from
Niagara Falls myself.

41:01.759 --> 41:03.094
Oh?

41:03.094 --> 41:06.197
Yes, it seems the police there
are opening an investigation

41:06.197 --> 41:07.699
into a suicide.

41:07.699 --> 41:10.468
Whatever are you
talking about, Detective?

41:10.468 --> 41:12.637
Yours, Miss McGinty.

41:12.637 --> 41:15.239
Or should I say, Miss Kline?

41:15.239 --> 41:18.009
Well, this is somewhat awkward.

41:18.009 --> 41:20.211
You're a con artist,
aren't you, Miss Kline?

41:20.211 --> 41:22.080
There are warrants for
your arrest in Windsor,

41:22.080 --> 41:22.981
London, and Cambridge.

41:22.981 --> 41:25.049
Oh, I never knew
I was so famous.

41:25.049 --> 41:26.417
Please stop joking.

41:26.417 --> 41:28.686
This is hardly a trivial matter.

41:28.686 --> 41:30.388
No, I suppose it isn't.

41:30.388 --> 41:32.323
This was all an
elaborate plan to steal

41:32.323 --> 41:35.526
Wendell Merrick's shares
of the company, wasn't it?

41:35.526 --> 41:38.196
Thomas resented that
Wendell was about to receive

41:38.196 --> 41:40.498
half of the family business
simply for marrying a girl,

41:40.498 --> 41:41.332
didn't he?

41:41.332 --> 41:44.535
The company was a mess when Tom
took it over from his father.

41:44.535 --> 41:46.104
He built it up single-handedly.

41:46.104 --> 41:47.271
I'm curious.

41:47.271 --> 41:49.407
And how did you two meet?

41:49.407 --> 41:51.109
At the Falls.

41:51.109 --> 41:52.643
Thomas had an eye
for the ladies.

41:52.643 --> 41:57.048
Ah, a rich gentleman
for an ambitious lady.

41:57.048 --> 41:59.183
We both had healthy appetites.

41:59.183 --> 42:02.320
But Thomas only had
half of a company.

42:02.320 --> 42:04.489
Why not the whole thing?

42:04.489 --> 42:06.090
Did he think of that?

42:06.090 --> 42:08.526
Or did you put the
idea in his head?

42:08.526 --> 42:11.229
Tom was more the
doer than the thinker.

42:11.229 --> 42:14.766
So when poor old Eunice
fell-- if she fell--

42:14.766 --> 42:16.567
That's conjecture.

42:16.567 --> 42:18.469
You decided to take her place.

42:18.469 --> 42:20.071
It was perfect.

42:20.071 --> 42:23.741
A new identity for the
wanted Bridget Kline.

42:23.741 --> 42:24.609
If you say so.

42:24.609 --> 42:27.612
Even better, you were
impersonating a lonely woman,

42:27.612 --> 42:30.148
desperate to marry,
who was about to meet

42:30.148 --> 42:31.716
an equally desperate
man, a man who

42:31.716 --> 42:33.684
was about to become very rich.

42:33.684 --> 42:36.354
Mm, a match made in heaven.

42:36.354 --> 42:39.357
And that's why you befriended
Daisy, because you knew she

42:39.357 --> 42:41.993
would introduce you to Wendell.

42:41.993 --> 42:45.430
Then the plan was to marry,
and after a few months, what?

42:45.430 --> 42:47.765
Maybe poor Wendell would
suffer a terrible fall

42:47.765 --> 42:50.334
and die, just like Eunice had.

42:50.334 --> 42:52.003
That would be highly ironic.

42:52.003 --> 42:54.038
And then the grieving
widow and her inheritance

42:54.038 --> 42:56.974
would find comfort in the
arms of her brother-in-law.

42:56.974 --> 42:59.744
You should write
books, Detective.

42:59.744 --> 43:02.513
What went wrong?

43:02.513 --> 43:04.982
I will piece this together.

43:04.982 --> 43:05.616
Count on it.

43:12.590 --> 43:15.293
Tom went to check on Wendell.

43:15.293 --> 43:16.227
He found him crying.

43:16.227 --> 43:18.196
Wendell had decided not to
go through with the wedding.

43:18.196 --> 43:22.200
It just wasn't fair to
him, it wasn't fair to him.

43:22.200 --> 43:23.267
Tom was such a hothead.

43:23.267 --> 43:24.602
I can't go through with this.
THOMAS: Wendell.

43:24.602 --> 43:25.736
I can't do this.
THOMAS: Wendell.

43:25.736 --> 43:27.572
-It's not fair.
-You listen to me.

43:27.572 --> 43:28.606
EUNICE (VOICEOVER): He could've
walked away right then.

43:28.606 --> 43:30.541
Do you have any idea
what I've been through?

43:30.541 --> 43:32.110
You tell them, or I will.

43:32.110 --> 43:35.413
EUNICE (VOICEOVER): But no, Tom
couldn't even get that right.

43:35.413 --> 43:36.581
Selfish!

43:36.581 --> 43:38.616
EUNICE (VOICEOVER): He didn't
even remember hitting Wendell.

43:41.319 --> 43:43.154
Where is Thomas now?

43:43.154 --> 43:43.988
In the other room.

43:52.763 --> 43:55.733
What have you done to him?

43:55.733 --> 43:57.435
Heroin.

43:57.435 --> 43:59.036
It really is a wonder drug.

44:10.548 --> 44:13.351
I've just returned
from the hospital.

44:13.351 --> 44:14.285
And?

44:14.285 --> 44:16.020
Thomas Merrick will live.

44:16.020 --> 44:16.754
And this Eunice?

44:16.754 --> 44:17.588
Bridget.

44:17.588 --> 44:19.023
Whatever her name is.

44:19.023 --> 44:20.625
She poisoned Merrick and
then decided to bugger off.

44:23.494 --> 44:24.362
What is it?

44:27.098 --> 44:30.368
Thomas Merrick didn't care that
his brother was a homosexual.

44:30.368 --> 44:31.636
And Wendell Merrick
wanted nothing

44:31.636 --> 44:33.171
to do with the family business.

44:33.171 --> 44:34.639
And your point is?

44:34.639 --> 44:39.010
That this whole affair
was tragically avoidable.

44:39.010 --> 44:41.712
If Mrs. Merrick had simply
let her sons be, none of this

44:41.712 --> 44:42.547
would've happened.

44:42.547 --> 44:44.315
Look, the old
dear was just doing

44:44.315 --> 44:46.617
what she thought was right.

44:46.617 --> 44:50.154
Would you care for--
oh, never mind.

44:50.154 --> 44:51.656
And furthermore, I
believe that the pressures

44:51.656 --> 44:52.490
of our investigation--

44:52.490 --> 44:54.091
Look, just hold it right there.

44:54.091 --> 44:57.195
I know what you're gonna say,
and it's complete rubbish.

44:57.195 --> 44:59.197
We were just doing our job.

44:59.197 --> 45:01.632
If Lawrence Braxton was too
delicate for this world,

45:01.632 --> 45:03.367
that's not our problem.

45:03.367 --> 45:05.236
I'm not saying we were
entirely responsible,

45:05.236 --> 45:07.505
just that it was the
culmination of these events.

45:07.505 --> 45:09.440
Listen, Murdoch,
you may be right.

45:09.440 --> 45:11.108
Maybe someday,
things will change.

45:11.108 --> 45:13.511
But until then, we just
carry on as best we can.

45:18.716 --> 45:22.520
Sir, regardless of how we
rationalize these events,

45:22.520 --> 45:24.622
Lawrence Braxton did leave
behind a wife and child.

45:30.294 --> 45:32.663
Good night, Murdoch.

45:32.663 --> 45:33.531
Good night, Inspector.

45:51.449 --> 45:54.252
Is there something you'd
like to tell me, William?

45:54.252 --> 45:55.753
Father, I find
myself questioning

45:55.753 --> 45:58.122
the basic tenets of my faith.

45:58.122 --> 46:00.358
We all face challenges.

46:00.358 --> 46:01.492
Even Jesus did.

46:04.395 --> 46:06.197
Two men are dead.

46:06.197 --> 46:09.333
By all standards, good men.

46:09.333 --> 46:11.168
Yet they're condemned
to eternal damnation.

46:11.168 --> 46:12.703
How can this be God's will?

46:12.703 --> 46:15.473
It is not for us to question
the will of the Lord.

46:15.473 --> 46:17.508
But that's just it, Father.

46:17.508 --> 46:21.679
I don't think I can
follow blindly anymore.

46:21.679 --> 46:24.382
Your faith must not waver.

46:24.382 --> 46:29.287
I imagine a world that
is more compassionate

46:29.287 --> 46:31.222
and-- and enlightened.

46:31.222 --> 46:34.058
Someday, it may be.

46:34.058 --> 46:36.193
Perhaps not in our lifetimes.

46:36.193 --> 46:40.598
In the meanwhile, trust in
the guidance of the Lord.

46:40.598 --> 46:45.436
Say two rosaries and
reflect on these matters.

46:45.436 --> 46:46.270
Thank you.

46:46.270 --> 46:47.705
I will.

46:47.705 --> 46:48.539
William.

46:51.375 --> 46:53.611
The man of the cloth
you came to me about.

46:53.611 --> 46:55.479
What did you decide to do?

46:55.479 --> 46:56.347
I said nothing.

47:05.356 --> 47:08.626
