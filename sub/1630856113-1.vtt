01:00.083 --> 01:02.083


01:06.916 --> 01:09.541


02:07.500 --> 02:09.500


02:44.625 --> 02:47.125
Yeah, it's, uh, quaint.

02:49.500 --> 02:51.083
It's really hot.

02:51.166 --> 02:52.458
Yeah.

02:53.958 --> 02:56.375
Just had some lady

02:56.458 --> 02:58.291
talking my ear off the whole time.

02:58.791 --> 02:59.791
How's your day?

02:59.875 --> 03:02.791
Oh.

03:08.375 --> 03:09.500
Yeah. Uh-huh.

03:11.291 --> 03:13.125
<i>If you're distracted
I'll call you later.</i>

03:13.208 --> 03:14.625
I'm listening.

03:17.375 --> 03:19.958
Oh my God. I hope you guys fall in.

03:37.791 --> 03:40.166
You just don't know.

03:40.250 --> 03:43.000
I told you what happened
when I met Judge Judy.

03:43.625 --> 03:44.750
That's true.

03:45.750 --> 03:48.083
Oof, these Hollywood types.

03:49.083 --> 03:51.083
Mary, come on!

03:52.875 --> 03:53.916
Rhonda.

03:54.416 --> 03:55.416
Hey, Joe.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.791
Please be careful.

03:59.875 --> 04:01.333
That's two.

04:05.500 --> 04:08.833
Honey, can you take the plates
and the cups out? They're over here.

04:09.541 --> 04:11.458
All of this. Take those, and...

04:11.541 --> 04:14.000
- And these too, if you can get them all.
- Mm-hmm.

04:14.875 --> 04:17.083
All I ask is that she's polite.

04:17.166 --> 04:20.791
You know, not just sitting there
with her big movie star sunglasses on.

04:20.875 --> 04:22.041
Like, too good for everything.

04:22.125 --> 04:24.958
If she's here, I want her to participate.

04:25.041 --> 04:28.875
I'm sure she will.
I mean, look at this beautiful day.

04:28.958 --> 04:30.666
Hey, where you going?

04:30.750 --> 04:31.583
Uh, the roof.

04:31.666 --> 04:35.000
I'm not calling anybody's mother
to say someone broke their neck and died.

04:35.083 --> 04:36.250
We'll be so safe.

04:37.833 --> 04:39.500
- Come on.
- Charlie.

04:39.583 --> 04:40.708
- Come on.
- Charlie.

04:40.791 --> 04:43.416
There's steps.
Oh my God. Let's go.

04:43.500 --> 04:45.625
Keep an eye on things for me, okay?

04:50.125 --> 04:51.083
Honestly.

05:03.958 --> 05:06.000
I don't think we have enough hot dogs.

05:08.791 --> 05:10.416
I saw a movie she was in.

05:11.250 --> 05:13.666
A pretty weird one where she gets naked.

05:14.458 --> 05:15.916
And does, like a...

05:16.583 --> 05:18.875
blood ritual. I couldn't really follow it.

05:20.166 --> 05:21.333
Where'd you see it?

05:23.208 --> 05:24.458
Just on TV.

05:28.041 --> 05:30.208
All right, I looked up
"Elizabeth Berry naked."

05:36.416 --> 05:37.791
I think that's you.

07:30.166 --> 07:31.958
- Hi.
- Just one little second.

07:33.125 --> 07:35.541
It's such a pleasure to meet you.

07:35.625 --> 07:37.375
You are so sweet.

07:37.458 --> 07:39.166
We're so happy to have you.

07:39.250 --> 07:40.750
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

07:42.875 --> 07:44.291
I thought you were taller. You look...

07:44.375 --> 07:47.291
You look taller on television,
but we're basically the same size.

07:47.375 --> 07:48.625
We're basically the same.

07:48.708 --> 07:52.250
I can't thank you enough for doing this.
It's so generous.

07:52.333 --> 07:55.458
My gosh, well, I want you
to tell the story right, don't I?

07:55.541 --> 07:59.833
That's... That's all I want.
I want you to feel seen and known.

07:59.916 --> 08:03.333
Those are my dogs.
That's Zeus, and that's Dutch.

08:03.416 --> 08:05.791
And, uh, ignore that pool.

08:06.583 --> 08:08.750
- It's a work in progress.
- Always.

08:08.833 --> 08:10.833
Oh. This was on your front steps.

08:12.166 --> 08:13.208
Joe!

08:14.500 --> 08:16.083
You're not gonna believe this.

08:16.791 --> 08:18.458
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

08:19.375 --> 08:20.375
I'll get a garbage bag.

08:20.458 --> 08:23.833
I have a sixth sense about these things.
God, I knew it.

08:23.916 --> 08:26.708
- What is it?
- Uh, it's a box of S-H-I-T.

08:27.458 --> 08:31.208
We haven't had one in a while
but it's just par for the course.

08:31.916 --> 08:33.333
Don't look so shocked.

08:33.416 --> 08:34.708
Do you know who sent it?

08:34.791 --> 08:38.416
Some sicko who probably
wasn't invited to any barbecues.

08:40.666 --> 08:42.125
- You want?
- Sure.

08:42.625 --> 08:45.416
- Oh, Sofia, let me help you with that.
- Don't worry.

08:45.500 --> 08:48.916
Okay, so make yourself at home,
look around, talk to people,

08:49.000 --> 08:51.708
do what you have to do,
and get yourself a hot dog.

08:51.791 --> 08:53.666
Great.

08:55.541 --> 08:56.666
Right here!

09:05.541 --> 09:06.416
Touchdown!

09:13.041 --> 09:14.875
- Nice, dude.
- Charlie!

09:20.208 --> 09:22.291
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

09:26.166 --> 09:29.500
- Well, we'll just support you.
- I know, just... Okay.

09:32.500 --> 09:34.083
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

09:34.583 --> 09:35.708
You're Mary, aren't you?

09:36.666 --> 09:37.750
Yeah.

09:37.833 --> 09:39.750
- You're one of the twins?
- Yeah.

09:39.833 --> 09:41.916
My brother's around here somewhere.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Our older sister's at college.

09:46.833 --> 09:47.833
Hi.

09:50.166 --> 09:53.291
I've never met
anyone who's on TV before.

09:53.375 --> 09:54.625
Well, your parents.

09:54.708 --> 09:58.166
Yeah, but, like... for real.

10:01.083 --> 10:02.583
Do you live in Calabasas?

10:03.375 --> 10:04.500
No.

10:05.791 --> 10:07.333
Dude, yo, look at this.

10:16.208 --> 10:17.750
They're sweet, aren't they?

10:19.041 --> 10:19.958
Very.

10:26.708 --> 10:29.416
They're a very beloved
part of this community.

10:30.750 --> 10:32.000
I can see that.

10:33.750 --> 10:34.625
So...

10:36.791 --> 10:39.708
What is it
you love most about Gracie?

10:40.916 --> 10:43.708
She always
knows what she wants.

10:44.583 --> 10:46.125
She's unapologetic.

10:49.375 --> 10:53.916
My son's been out of the house
for a while now and it's quiet, but...

10:55.458 --> 10:59.583
I can always call up Gracie and say,
"What are we doing today?" And...

11:01.208 --> 11:02.500
there's always an answer.

11:04.333 --> 11:07.666
It really feels like things
just settled down, and...

11:09.416 --> 11:10.875
now y'all are making a movie.

11:12.500 --> 11:13.458
It's...

11:14.583 --> 11:15.833
It's a very...

11:17.083 --> 11:20.291
complex and... and human story.

11:23.583 --> 11:24.541
Just...

11:28.250 --> 11:29.375
be kind.

12:07.166 --> 12:09.166
<i>Eyes round, pointy.</i>

12:10.666 --> 12:12.791
<i>Closed when they're open.</i>

12:13.416 --> 12:14.916
<i>Pink lipstick.</i>

12:24.916 --> 12:26.208
<i>Slight pout.</i>

12:26.875 --> 12:29.250
<i>Bird-like, but steely.</i>

12:31.541 --> 12:32.916
<i>Mechanical.</i>

12:33.500 --> 12:35.041
<i>Or just removed.</i>

12:49.833 --> 12:52.083
<i>The award
goes to Elizabeth Berry!</i>

12:53.166 --> 12:55.541
<i>I'd like to thank
everyone who voted for me.</i>

12:55.625 --> 13:00.000
<i>It means the most coming from you.
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!</i>

13:02.875 --> 13:04.291
<i>Clean.</i>

13:04.375 --> 13:05.500
<i>Fresh.</i>

13:06.291 --> 13:07.500
<i>You.</i>

13:09.083 --> 13:10.541
<i>Clean.</i>

13:10.625 --> 13:11.625
<i>Fresh.</i>

13:12.291 --> 13:13.291
<i>You.</i>

13:14.500 --> 13:15.958
<i>Clean.</i>

13:16.041 --> 13:17.166
<i>Fresh.</i>

13:17.875 --> 13:19.458
<i>- You.</i>

13:30.750 --> 13:32.375
You smell like charcoal.

13:33.458 --> 13:34.458
Smoke.

13:35.500 --> 13:36.625
Excuse me?

13:37.875 --> 13:41.375
We have a gas grill,
so you just must be smelling smoke.

13:41.458 --> 13:43.916
Yeah, well,
it's stinking up the sheets.

13:45.333 --> 13:47.041
Do you want me to shower?

13:48.750 --> 13:51.916
What I want is for you
to have showered before you get in.

14:05.625 --> 14:07.166
Still smokey.

14:09.291 --> 14:10.541
Sorry.

14:23.416 --> 14:25.958
Okay?

14:27.333 --> 14:28.166
Okay.

14:30.500 --> 14:32.208
Everything's fine.

14:33.208 --> 14:34.208
Okay.

15:33.083 --> 15:35.083


15:40.333 --> 15:41.666


15:43.666 --> 15:45.208


15:47.000 --> 15:49.666


16:13.083 --> 16:16.166
You start with your greens as a base,

16:16.250 --> 16:19.416
and then you choose your focus flower.

16:22.166 --> 16:23.208
- How's that?
- Like that?

16:23.291 --> 16:24.291
- Yes.
- Yes.

16:25.125 --> 16:27.458
I don't like this part.

16:28.500 --> 16:33.916
So, my brother, Scott,
is a Rear Admiral in the Navy,

16:34.000 --> 16:37.291
and he says that order is its own reward.

16:37.375 --> 16:39.750
- Well, that is so pretty.
- Oh.

16:40.500 --> 16:41.791
Thank you. Yeah.

16:42.916 --> 16:43.958
You set a date?

16:44.458 --> 16:46.583
No, we've been so busy.

16:46.666 --> 16:49.875
We'll figure it out down the line
when it feels right.

16:49.958 --> 16:50.875
Mm-hmm.

16:51.958 --> 16:52.875
I see.

16:53.916 --> 16:55.291
Beautiful, ladies.

16:55.375 --> 16:58.125
Oh. Thank you, Lydia. This is Elizabeth.

16:58.208 --> 17:01.333
She's playing me in a movie,
so I'm trying to show her a good time.

17:02.750 --> 17:04.250
That I don't doubt.

17:08.916 --> 17:10.541
Why do you want to play me?

17:11.791 --> 17:12.666
Uh...

17:13.166 --> 17:15.791
When they sent me the script,
I just thought...

17:17.416 --> 17:19.500
now here is a woman

17:19.583 --> 17:21.875
with a lot more to her than

17:22.416 --> 17:25.291
I remember from the tabloids and our...

17:25.958 --> 17:27.333
cultural memory.

17:27.416 --> 17:28.291
Um...

17:29.666 --> 17:32.208
I don't really think about all that.

17:33.291 --> 17:35.791
You don't ever dwell on the past?

17:37.000 --> 17:39.833
I have my plate pretty full.

17:39.916 --> 17:40.875
Mm.

17:42.125 --> 17:44.708
I mean, I know that for me, personally,

17:46.625 --> 17:48.625
the past weighs on me.

17:48.708 --> 17:52.291
You know, decisions I've made,
or relationships.

17:56.458 --> 18:01.750
So you just sit there and you think about
your history and your behavior.

18:03.500 --> 18:04.875
Yeah, sometimes.

18:12.166 --> 18:15.666
Thank you so much for having me
here for dinner in your home.

18:15.750 --> 18:17.416
It really... It means a lot.

18:17.500 --> 18:19.208
Oh. 'Course.

18:20.041 --> 18:23.625
It's a shame that Mary couldn't join us
tonight, but she's at her friend's.

18:24.125 --> 18:25.625
I don't want this.

18:26.125 --> 18:27.125
There you are.

18:27.208 --> 18:28.958
- Mama--
- Charlie, sit.

18:36.375 --> 18:40.291
He's got a severe calcium deficiency,
don't you?

18:49.375 --> 18:50.208
Mm.

18:50.708 --> 18:52.000
This is delicious.

18:52.083 --> 18:54.416
- It's an Atherton-Yoo specialty.
- Mm.

18:55.541 --> 18:59.208
- Is it squab?
- No, quail. I brought them home myself.

19:00.666 --> 19:02.500
You shot and, um...

19:03.375 --> 19:05.250
- fried the quail yourself?
- Mm-hmm.

19:05.333 --> 19:06.875
Gracie hunts all the time.

19:06.958 --> 19:08.125
My daddy taught me.

19:08.208 --> 19:11.791
I started going with him and my brothers
when I was young, like four or five.

19:11.875 --> 19:13.708
Amazing. This was in Virginia?

19:13.791 --> 19:15.291
Um, Tennessee.

19:15.375 --> 19:19.791
Tennessee, and then Illinois,
and then Montana, and then Virginia.

19:21.708 --> 19:22.791
Charlie, eat.

19:23.291 --> 19:26.250
I'm really not hungry. I had a late lunch.

19:27.041 --> 19:28.666
What, your little gushy treats?

19:29.958 --> 19:31.166
How old do you think I am?

19:31.250 --> 19:33.458
I want you to look strong
when you go to college.

19:33.541 --> 19:37.041
You need your nutrients. They're gonna
think you skipped a grade or something.

19:37.833 --> 19:39.041
Can I be excused?

19:48.166 --> 19:50.291
Boys are hard.

19:52.833 --> 19:57.500
So what was it like moving all the time,
having to uproot your life, and...

19:58.875 --> 20:01.708
It was just my life. I was used to it.

20:01.791 --> 20:04.958
I made friends wherever I went,
I was very close to my brothers.

20:05.041 --> 20:06.000
Hmm.

20:06.083 --> 20:09.000
I think my childhood was exceptional.

20:13.291 --> 20:16.708
I have a lot of questions for both of you,
but please...

20:17.375 --> 20:19.791
Please tell me
if this is not the best time.

20:19.875 --> 20:21.416
It's as good a time as any.

20:22.041 --> 20:23.625
Great.

20:24.750 --> 20:25.791
Thank you.

20:27.791 --> 20:30.416
I wanted to ask you about the box.
The package.

20:31.583 --> 20:32.541
What about it?

20:32.625 --> 20:35.166
I mean, is that a routine occurrence?

20:35.250 --> 20:37.583
- It's a lot less than it used to be.
- Mm.

20:38.875 --> 20:41.666
Did you ever consider leaving town?

20:41.750 --> 20:44.458
Why should we be the ones that leave?

20:44.541 --> 20:47.750
Yeah, our whole family's here.
My dad. Gracie's kids.

20:47.833 --> 20:49.125
Mm.

20:52.750 --> 20:55.041
Do you remember when you first met?

20:56.500 --> 20:57.625
I don't really.

20:58.208 --> 21:00.083
I don't know. Let me see.

21:00.166 --> 21:01.458
I met Joe...

21:02.291 --> 21:03.208
Um...

21:03.791 --> 21:06.166
Well, I remember knowing of his family.

21:06.250 --> 21:08.750
They were the only Korean family
in the neighborhood.

21:08.833 --> 21:10.250
- Half.
- Yes.

21:10.333 --> 21:14.500
And my son Georgie was
in the same year as Joe at school,

21:14.583 --> 21:18.291
so technically I would have met him there,
but I don't have any memory of that.

21:18.375 --> 21:20.041
- Right.
- Um...

21:20.125 --> 21:22.958
The... Everyone's pretty close-knit
here on the island,

21:23.041 --> 21:25.041
and you kind of recognize everyone.

21:25.125 --> 21:27.583
There was a point
when he was friendlier with Georgie,

21:27.666 --> 21:31.166
but I didn't really meet him until he came
to the pet store looking for a job.

21:31.250 --> 21:33.041
That was
summer after sixth grade?

21:33.125 --> 21:34.666
Seventh.

21:34.750 --> 21:38.083
And then he started working there
after school and on the weekends.

21:39.208 --> 21:40.125
And...

21:40.625 --> 21:43.375
what's it like with Georgie,
your friendship?

21:43.958 --> 21:47.708
I haven't really talked
to Georgie much since then.

21:48.208 --> 21:52.000
Georgie's very sensitive.
He always was very, very sensitive.

21:52.083 --> 21:54.708
What's your relationship like with him
and your other kids?

21:54.791 --> 21:55.875
How is that relevant?

21:57.041 --> 21:58.041
Um...

21:58.125 --> 22:03.250
It's my understanding that the movie takes
place between 1992 and 1994, am I wrong?

22:03.333 --> 22:06.625
So why would you need to know
anything that happened after that?

22:09.750 --> 22:11.208
Well, um...

22:12.958 --> 22:14.750
There are things that exist

22:15.291 --> 22:19.541
inside people that don't necessarily

22:20.541 --> 22:26.750
come to head until later and I try
and look for the seeds of those things.

22:26.833 --> 22:27.666
Um...

22:29.166 --> 22:30.125
Mm-hmm.

22:30.666 --> 22:32.291
Of course I talk to Georgie.

22:32.375 --> 22:35.750
- And to Billy. And Cassidy. I'm their mom.
- Cassidy was just here last...

22:35.833 --> 22:38.208
What was it?
And we'll see everyone at graduation.

22:38.291 --> 22:42.541
The twins are in the same grade
as Cassidy's son Peter, my grandson.

22:42.625 --> 22:45.875
So we'll all be at graduation together,
which you're welcome to come to,

22:45.958 --> 22:47.291
if you're still here.

22:47.375 --> 22:48.416
Thank you.

22:49.416 --> 22:52.125
I hope that you are saving
some room for dessert,

22:52.208 --> 22:56.041
because I did make
something very special, right?

23:02.083 --> 23:03.166
Goodnight.

23:03.250 --> 23:04.375
Yeah, see you.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.625
Actually, I wanted to ask, um...

23:09.708 --> 23:14.041
How would you feel about me coming
to visit you at work one of these days?

23:14.583 --> 23:16.083
- Fine. Yeah.
- Great.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.458
That's great. Thank you.

23:18.541 --> 23:19.666
It's no problem.

23:21.250 --> 23:24.416
I just realized
we're basically the same age.

23:24.500 --> 23:26.250
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I'm 36.

23:26.333 --> 23:28.666
- Yeah, we--
- Funny, I...

23:29.208 --> 23:31.666
I'm just now starting
to think about having kids,

23:31.750 --> 23:34.333
and you're almost
sending yours off to college.

23:34.416 --> 23:36.416
- Yeah.
- I can't imagine.

23:36.500 --> 23:38.666
I think it was almost, uh...

23:38.750 --> 23:40.041
I think I...

23:40.125 --> 23:44.000
I didn't know what a big deal it was,
in a way, because, you know...

23:44.833 --> 23:46.458
Um, but, anyway...

23:49.125 --> 23:52.625
I'll text you, and we can schedule
a time for me to drop by.

23:52.708 --> 23:56.916
Maybe, uh, write Gracie about...
She's better at that stuff.

23:59.333 --> 24:02.208
- All right, well, yeah, get home safe.
- Yeah, you too.

24:02.291 --> 24:03.250
Mm-hmm.

24:03.333 --> 24:04.791
I mean...

24:15.125 --> 24:18.041
It's strange,
even after everything she did...

24:18.125 --> 24:19.041
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

24:19.125 --> 24:20.250
...and how public it was,

24:20.333 --> 24:24.041
she doesn't seem to
carry around any shame or guilt.

24:24.125 --> 24:26.750
<i>Yeah, that's probably
a personality disorder.</i>

24:26.833 --> 24:28.166
All right, forget it.

24:28.250 --> 24:31.250
<i>I'm not trying to be glib.
It's in the TV movie you showed me.</i>

24:31.333 --> 24:33.416
But isn't it kind of radical?

24:33.500 --> 24:36.333
I mean, clean slate every day.

24:37.416 --> 24:39.666
No doubts. No regrets.

24:39.750 --> 24:40.791
<i>Meaning what?</i>

24:42.041 --> 24:43.875
<i>Now you have all these doubts?</i>

24:43.958 --> 24:45.125
No.

24:46.958 --> 24:50.791
Oh God, someone's calling me from
the network, I should probably take this.

24:50.875 --> 24:52.333
- Love you.
- I love--

25:07.625 --> 25:10.875
...by someone who was seeking wealth,
political power, fame...

25:16.958 --> 25:20.708
In England in those days, if someone
owed money and could not pay bills...

25:26.625 --> 25:27.625
Hey!

25:28.208 --> 25:29.541
Hi.

25:30.041 --> 25:31.208
Hi.

25:31.291 --> 25:33.291
- Tom Atherton.
- Hi. Elizabeth.

25:33.375 --> 25:36.375
Thank you so much for doing this.

25:36.458 --> 25:41.333
My pleasure. I got you a coffee.
It's regular drip. I hope that's okay.

25:41.416 --> 25:43.375
Oh, thank you. I appreciate it so much.

25:43.458 --> 25:48.000
I'm sure this isn't your favorite
topic of conversation.

25:48.083 --> 25:49.833
You know, actually, I don't mind.

25:49.916 --> 25:52.666
I think sometimes talking can feel good.

25:53.833 --> 25:54.916
That's great.

25:55.791 --> 25:59.041
So I guess we will just... dive in.

25:59.708 --> 26:00.916
Want something to eat?

26:01.000 --> 26:03.666
- No, I'm fine with just coffee, thank you.
- Hey, Carla!

26:03.750 --> 26:04.833
Hi, Tom!

26:04.916 --> 26:08.166
Yeah, that's my dental hygienist.
Anyway, sorry.

26:09.250 --> 26:12.583
- Yeah.
- So, maybe we can start with...

26:13.458 --> 26:16.500
you telling me about
what Gracie was like when you first met.

26:17.541 --> 26:18.375
Uh...

26:20.000 --> 26:21.958
She was beautiful. You know?

26:22.041 --> 26:23.041
She was...

26:24.000 --> 26:25.416
And we met at a party.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.583
And I was drunk.

26:28.666 --> 26:30.041
Like blotto drunk.

26:30.666 --> 26:32.250
And she took care of me.

26:32.333 --> 26:33.375
And...

26:34.250 --> 26:36.083
We started dating after that.

26:37.083 --> 26:39.541
She was in high school, I was in college.

26:39.625 --> 26:41.208
She graduated, I graduated.

26:41.291 --> 26:42.750
I proposed and...

26:43.333 --> 26:45.916
that was it. A, B, C, D.

26:46.875 --> 26:48.000
You were happy?

26:49.000 --> 26:49.916
Yeah.

26:50.666 --> 26:51.875
I felt very happy.

26:52.750 --> 26:55.916
I know later she said
that things weren't working,

26:56.416 --> 27:00.333
but I gotta tell you, at the time,
I felt like everything was normal. Um...

27:01.125 --> 27:04.791
I mean, look, couples fight sometimes,
but our lives felt good.

27:04.875 --> 27:07.916
Yeah, we had a...
We had a great family, I thought.

27:11.208 --> 27:13.416
Mm. You know, so it was a...

27:14.416 --> 27:15.500
I was shocked.

27:16.958 --> 27:17.916
Shocked.

27:21.416 --> 27:24.625
- And then when I found out with who--
- That must have been really hard.

27:26.458 --> 27:29.791
It was just so, uh... weird.

27:29.875 --> 27:30.875
It was like...

27:31.541 --> 27:33.916
Like I didn't even know Gracie.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.125
Like, what would make

27:35.833 --> 27:40.791
a 36-year-old woman
have an affair with a seventh grader?

27:45.583 --> 27:46.541
Beats me.

27:52.375 --> 27:53.625
How'd you find out?

27:53.708 --> 27:55.708
I found out the way everybody found out,

27:55.791 --> 27:59.458
when they got busted in that stupid
stockroom at the pet store,

27:59.541 --> 28:01.125
and she got arrested.

28:01.208 --> 28:03.666
Then, here comes the cops at the house!

28:03.750 --> 28:06.375
"Tell me what's going on."
And I'm like, "What?"

28:07.208 --> 28:09.041
Oh, I'm so, so sorry.

28:09.125 --> 28:11.500
Yeah, it's... Like, you know what?
It's okay.

28:11.583 --> 28:12.625
And...

28:13.500 --> 28:14.625
I'm happy now.

28:16.791 --> 28:19.333
I don't see them very much,
but her and the boy,

28:19.416 --> 28:21.416
you know, they seem happy, so...

28:24.166 --> 28:25.208
what do I know?

28:25.958 --> 28:28.833
<i>Sneaks down
the left side for a base hit.</i>

28:28.916 --> 28:31.916
<i>He goes the opposite way with it,
one run comes around.</i>

28:35.125 --> 28:38.458
Oh, isn't that perfect!

28:38.541 --> 28:40.000
Oh, that's really pretty.

28:40.083 --> 28:43.375
- I feel like a bride.
- You look youthful.

28:43.458 --> 28:45.333
Like the first day of spring.

28:46.125 --> 28:48.833
I just feel like everyone else
is gonna be wearing more, like,

28:48.916 --> 28:51.458
- summery dresses.
- Who cares about everyone else?

28:51.541 --> 28:54.791
- Me. I am saying I don't like it.
- Oh, okay. Okay. Okay.

28:54.875 --> 28:57.000
- Just... Then try on the others.
- Okay.

28:58.541 --> 29:01.458
- Will they not be wearing robes?
- Yes, they'll be wearing robes.

29:02.458 --> 29:04.416
- This is for under the robe.
- Ah.

29:11.708 --> 29:13.291
I heard you saw Tom.

29:13.375 --> 29:15.083
Yes, for coffee.

29:16.208 --> 29:17.291
How was he?

29:18.291 --> 29:21.333
- He's handsome.
- Oh yes, he's very handsome.

29:22.458 --> 29:26.750
I could see how being in a relationship
with him, in a marriage,

29:26.833 --> 29:28.375
would be isolating.

29:30.791 --> 29:31.791
Precisely.

29:33.375 --> 29:35.291
Why'd you marry a man like Tom?

29:35.875 --> 29:39.208
I was young and he was...

29:40.083 --> 29:42.083
He seemed perfect on paper.

29:42.166 --> 29:43.666
It was a different time.

29:45.958 --> 29:48.833
My father used to say,
"You're eith..."

29:48.916 --> 29:53.125
"You're either leaving this house
in a veil, or in a box."

29:53.625 --> 29:56.458
No!

29:56.541 --> 29:58.166
- Isn't that funny?
- That's wild.

29:58.250 --> 29:59.708
Oh!

29:59.791 --> 30:00.958
So cute!

30:01.041 --> 30:02.750
Oh, it's lovely!

30:02.833 --> 30:05.125
- I love the fabric.
- I love it.

30:05.208 --> 30:06.750
I love how it flows.

30:09.166 --> 30:14.041
Oh Mary, I wanna commend you for being
so brave and showing your arms like that.

30:14.125 --> 30:17.000
That's something I always wished
I could do when I was your age.

30:17.083 --> 30:20.333
Just not care about
these unrealistic beauty standards.

30:20.833 --> 30:22.541
You're different than me.

30:23.083 --> 30:24.583
You're a modern woman.

30:28.250 --> 30:32.375
I'm gonna go try on some of the other
dresses. I really like this one. Um...

30:33.083 --> 30:36.041
I think it's just too similar
to the one Molly has.

30:36.625 --> 30:38.875
- Okay. Whatever you want.
- Okay.

30:48.458 --> 30:50.291
So, it's not my business who you talk to,

30:50.375 --> 30:53.708
I mean, you can go through the phone book
for all I care, but I just, um...

30:55.333 --> 30:59.541
Just let me know ahead of time
so I don't have to lie to my neighbors.

31:01.791 --> 31:02.916
Understood.

31:06.125 --> 31:07.666
I, um...

31:08.791 --> 31:10.750
brought you something. Um...

31:12.166 --> 31:14.708
It's... If it's helpful...

31:14.791 --> 31:16.125
It's just a loan.

31:16.708 --> 31:18.000
Oh!

31:18.083 --> 31:19.791
Wow, these are great.

31:20.416 --> 31:21.833
That was from our wedding,

31:21.916 --> 31:23.458
which <i>The Insider</i> did.

31:23.541 --> 31:26.625
- Which really helped us with the house.
- Gorgeous.

31:27.291 --> 31:31.291
Ah, how sweet is that!

31:31.375 --> 31:33.583
- Really sweet.
- You like it?

31:33.666 --> 31:36.125
- I love it.
- Very in.

31:48.166 --> 31:50.333
<i>How long
have you owned this place?</i>

31:50.416 --> 31:52.500
It was my mother's.

31:52.583 --> 31:54.625
- She opened it in 1972.
- Hm.

31:56.125 --> 31:59.083
- So we had a good run.
- Yeah, beautiful store.

31:59.166 --> 32:01.833
So, was she the one that hired Gracie?

32:02.333 --> 32:05.291
Oh. Well, my mother's health
was in decline,

32:05.916 --> 32:11.333
and Gracie had been a loyal customer after
they opened that Kmart around the corner.

32:11.416 --> 32:13.416
This was what year?

32:13.500 --> 32:14.458
Uh...

32:15.125 --> 32:17.166
It was after my mother's fall.

32:18.791 --> 32:20.833
Mm. 1990. October.

32:22.166 --> 32:25.416
At first, she was just watching the store,

32:26.416 --> 32:29.666
then she took on
more and more responsibilities.

32:29.750 --> 32:32.458
Balancing the books, orders.

32:34.583 --> 32:37.291
Very organized. I'll give her that much.

32:38.291 --> 32:40.500
Were you the one who hired Joe?

32:40.583 --> 32:42.583
Oh no. No, no, no.

32:43.166 --> 32:46.875
Gracie asked if she could hire
a part-time helper at minimum wage.

32:46.958 --> 32:51.625
That was summer, '92, and mother said yes.

32:52.500 --> 32:54.500
We were really surprised,

32:54.583 --> 32:58.000
to say the least, to be a part of...
what all happened.

32:59.083 --> 33:01.333
This... pretty much sums it up.

33:04.333 --> 33:05.500
Oh, wow.

33:07.666 --> 33:10.083
Anyway, I should
probably get back to work.

33:10.166 --> 33:11.166
One more thing.

33:11.708 --> 33:13.666
I'd love to see the stockroom.

33:38.583 --> 33:41.458
Just... don't touch any of the bait.

33:42.208 --> 33:43.166
Will do.

36:24.458 --> 36:27.958
<i>Hi, I'm Bob Vila.
Welcome to</i> This Old House.

36:28.041 --> 36:30.041
<i>As you can see, work is underway.</i>

36:30.125 --> 36:32.916
<i>In this program, we'll be looking
at some exterior repairs</i>

36:33.000 --> 36:34.208
<i>that have to be made,</i>

36:34.291 --> 36:37.750
<i>as well as listening to an energy audit,
looking at some interior demolition,</i>

36:37.833 --> 36:40.541
<i>and discussing our kitchen plans,
which we haven't made yet.</i>

36:40.625 --> 36:42.625
<i>First, let's go up
and talk with Norm Abram...</i>

36:42.708 --> 36:44.083


36:44.166 --> 36:47.416
<i>...who's already tackling
some of the problems we looked at earlier,</i>

36:47.500 --> 36:48.916
<i>- rot.</i>

36:49.833 --> 36:51.083
<i>- Hi, Norm.</i>
<i>Hi, Bob.</i>

36:51.541 --> 36:53.541
<i>Wonder if you could talk
for just a minute.</i>

36:53.625 --> 36:56.041
<i>- Wanna get a closer look at the eaves.
</i> <i>Sure.</i>

36:56.125 --> 36:59.583
-
<i>-</i> <i>Let's see how bad things are.</i>

36:59.666 --> 37:01.083
<i>What have you found so far?</i>

37:01.166 --> 37:03.166
- <i>We found a lot of rot.
</i>

37:03.250 --> 37:06.541
<i>Yes, and that's caused
the majority of the problems.</i>

37:06.625 --> 37:07.583


37:07.666 --> 37:09.875
<i>You've taken the gutter
and fascia board off.</i>

37:09.958 --> 37:12.083
<i>Right. I got your boards
and all these blocks.</i>

37:12.166 --> 37:16.125
<i>And we found that the way
the gutter was installed, that it...</i>

37:16.833 --> 37:20.000
- Joe, where's the step stool?
- One sec.

37:21.916 --> 37:23.500
Thank you.

37:25.625 --> 37:28.166
Did you ask your father
how he's getting to graduation?

37:28.250 --> 37:30.666
I was gonna drop
some groceries off this week.

37:30.750 --> 37:31.666
I'll ask.

37:33.375 --> 37:35.333
What are you gonna do with your bugs?

37:35.416 --> 37:36.416
Um...

37:37.250 --> 37:38.416
I'll figure it out.

37:39.208 --> 37:41.791
- Just not in the bedroom again, okay?
- Okay.

38:10.916 --> 38:11.875
Okay.

38:33.458 --> 38:35.291
<i>Hi, everyone. I'm Tyler Ko.</i>

38:35.375 --> 38:39.708
<i>I'm 5'6", I'm 13 years old,
I was born on April 20th, 2002.</i>

38:39.791 --> 38:42.416
2002? Jesus Christ.

38:45.125 --> 38:46.416
<i>Do you need any help?</i>

38:46.500 --> 38:48.125
<i>That'd be great, Joe. Thank you.</i>

38:48.208 --> 38:49.458
<i>What should I do?</i>

38:49.541 --> 38:51.708
<i>You wanna get the box
of pinkies in the back?</i>

38:51.791 --> 38:54.083
<i>- For feeding the snakes.
- Live mice?</i>

38:54.166 --> 38:57.208
<i>They've been in the freezer,
so I don't think they'll feel anything.</i>

38:57.291 --> 39:01.541
<i>Benny Kim, five foot, 13 years old,
and I'm with Coast to Coast.</i>

39:09.583 --> 39:10.791
How'd he do it?

39:11.375 --> 39:13.500
Skateboarding off the roof.

39:13.583 --> 39:14.833
Birthday party.

39:16.541 --> 39:18.583
Are there any pictures?

39:19.625 --> 39:21.375
Yeah.

39:30.583 --> 39:31.541
Oh.

39:32.083 --> 39:33.708
Only 13.

39:40.750 --> 39:42.125
So small.

39:42.916 --> 39:44.291
- Yeah.
- Mm.

39:50.041 --> 39:52.083
Ah. It's peaceful in here.

39:52.166 --> 39:53.166
Mm.

39:53.250 --> 39:55.666
A lot different than a movie set,
I would think.

39:56.583 --> 39:57.625
True.

40:01.291 --> 40:04.041
Backstage during a play,

40:04.625 --> 40:05.916
it's kinda like this.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.291
You act in plays?

40:08.375 --> 40:10.583
Sometimes. I should do it more often.

40:11.541 --> 40:13.583
Got my start in the theater.

40:15.416 --> 40:16.916
I've seen your TV show.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.291
Oh God.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.250
Very intense.

40:20.333 --> 40:24.500
I've been very lucky to have it,
but I kinda wish no one ever watched it.

40:25.708 --> 40:29.666
Yeah, I, um... I saw one where you

40:29.750 --> 40:31.875
had to operate on an elephant.

40:31.958 --> 40:33.833
Oh God.
Now I'm really embarrassed.

40:33.916 --> 40:37.875
Now I'm gonna have to jump off
the roof with those boys.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.916
Thank you for having me.

40:44.541 --> 40:46.791
- Yeah, you think it'll help?
- Yeah.

40:47.333 --> 40:52.833
I... I already have an idea
of what it must've felt like.

40:53.916 --> 40:55.375
What what felt like?

40:55.458 --> 40:57.166
Sneaking around with you.

40:58.291 --> 41:00.166
I probably
shouldn't have said that.

41:00.791 --> 41:02.500
You won't tell anyone, will you?

41:05.208 --> 41:06.166
No worries.

41:10.000 --> 41:14.291
Well,
it's, um, kind of lunch time now, so...

41:35.083 --> 41:39.958
<i>♪ Shadows grow so long before my eyes ♪</i>

41:41.208 --> 41:43.208
<i>♪ And they're moving ♪</i>

41:44.208 --> 41:45.666
Oh my God.

41:45.750 --> 41:47.375

41:48.583 --> 41:52.833

41:56.291 --> 41:59.000
I must say you evoke her.

41:59.083 --> 42:02.208
- You really do.
- Oh. Thanks.

42:04.750 --> 42:06.750
What specifically?

42:06.833 --> 42:10.833
A... You just have a... a loveliness,
a... a brightness.

42:10.916 --> 42:12.875
Like there isn't
an angry bone in your body.

42:14.666 --> 42:15.875
That's very sweet.

42:17.041 --> 42:18.458
All right, so...

42:20.166 --> 42:21.708
When did you meet Gracie?

42:22.375 --> 42:27.208
Well, my wife and kids and I
had just moved down from New York.

42:27.833 --> 42:30.875
I'd been doing
a lot of very high-profile cases,

42:30.958 --> 42:33.916
defending some pretty despicable men,
as it were.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.916
And, um, Sharon finally had had it.

42:37.000 --> 42:40.291
She said, "I'm moving down to Savannah.
Feel free to come with."

42:40.375 --> 42:41.208
So...

42:41.875 --> 42:44.583
And it's funny, really, because

42:45.416 --> 42:47.750
for all the rapists,
murderers, frauds, hitmen,

42:47.833 --> 42:50.833
never did I end up
on the front page of the <i>New York Times.</i>

42:50.916 --> 42:53.625
But for Gracie, I ended up
on the front page of the <i>New York Times.</i>

42:53.708 --> 42:54.541
Wow.

42:54.625 --> 42:56.208
- Down in Slow-vannah.
- Thank you.

42:57.708 --> 42:59.791
Anyway, I get a call
one night after dinner

42:59.875 --> 43:01.541
to go down to the station.

43:01.625 --> 43:05.791
And sitting there
in her floral blouse is Gracie.

43:05.875 --> 43:08.916
And what I said was, "I think I know you."

43:09.000 --> 43:11.083
She said, "I'm Gracie Atherton,
I'm your neighbor."

43:11.166 --> 43:13.416
"I brought you a blueberry pound cake."

43:13.500 --> 43:14.750
And of course it was.

43:14.833 --> 43:17.916
So, I said, "What can I help you with?"

43:18.000 --> 43:19.833
And that's when she told me.

43:22.166 --> 43:24.583
What did she say exactly?

43:24.666 --> 43:28.833
She said,
"I got caught having an affair."

43:28.916 --> 43:32.541
And I said, "Gracie, forgive me,
but that's not illegal in this country,

43:32.625 --> 43:35.958
and if it were, there'd be a lot of people
in serious trouble."

43:36.875 --> 43:37.916
And, um...

43:40.041 --> 43:41.666
then she started to cry.

43:42.875 --> 43:46.125
She said, uh, "We're in love."

43:47.541 --> 43:50.666
"I didn't mean for it to happen,
but we fell in love."

43:51.250 --> 43:54.250
So she was in denial, you would say?

43:54.333 --> 43:55.875
Oh, absolutely.

43:55.958 --> 43:59.333
She, uh... She didn't think
she did anything wrong.

43:59.416 --> 44:01.416
She was head over heels.

44:02.000 --> 44:03.541
It was a good-looking kid.

44:03.625 --> 44:08.625
But she had no conception. I mean, prison?
Pshh.

44:08.708 --> 44:12.166
She thought she could just explain it all
to the judge and that'd be that.

44:12.250 --> 44:15.416
It was a little...
A little <i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>

44:15.500 --> 44:17.208
A little bit starry-eyed.

44:17.291 --> 44:18.708
When did it sink in?

44:19.916 --> 44:21.500
Has it sunk in yet?

44:22.125 --> 44:24.416
Jesus Christ,
can we play this any slower?

44:24.500 --> 44:27.416
I apologize for this being
the slowest version of this song ever.

44:27.500 --> 44:29.458
It's the drummer's fault.

44:29.541 --> 44:31.416
- What the hell?
- Fuck you.

44:31.500 --> 44:33.750
- Have you met Georgie yet?
- Fuck you, Georgie.

44:33.833 --> 44:36.041
- That's... That's Georgie?
- Yeah.

44:37.041 --> 44:39.166
I'd hoped things
would work out better for him.

44:39.250 --> 44:41.250
- Holy shit.
- He was a very sweet boy.

44:41.333 --> 44:43.416
Very sensitive.

44:44.208 --> 44:48.166
- Well, hey, look what the cat dragged in.
- Yeah.

44:48.250 --> 44:50.250
- How you doing, Georgie?
- Hey.

44:50.333 --> 44:52.416
This is Elizabeth Berry.

44:52.500 --> 44:53.958
Oh, I know who this is.

44:54.666 --> 44:57.166
I know perfectly well.

44:58.750 --> 45:00.041
The actress.

45:01.000 --> 45:01.958
The son.

45:02.041 --> 45:04.291
How much they paying you for this?
Is it a lot?

45:04.875 --> 45:06.083
Are they paying her?

45:06.791 --> 45:07.666
No?

45:07.750 --> 45:09.250
It's an independent movie.

45:09.333 --> 45:11.208
We don't mean
to interrupt your show.

45:11.875 --> 45:14.333
- Georgie, you...
- Why don't you...

45:15.250 --> 45:16.416
look me in the eye

45:17.583 --> 45:20.250
and tell me how selfish I am.

45:20.333 --> 45:23.291
- I'll tell you if it's a match.
- All right. Let's get the check.

45:23.375 --> 45:26.500
I'm glad this happened.
I really wanted to meet you.

45:27.375 --> 45:28.791
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

45:31.083 --> 45:32.333
What have you heard?

45:32.833 --> 45:35.125
I've heard you're really creative.

45:35.208 --> 45:37.125
And sensitive and sweet.

45:40.875 --> 45:43.208
Well, they would say that.

45:44.833 --> 45:46.333
Well, what are you then?

45:49.416 --> 45:52.708
I'm a phoenix rising from the ashes.

45:55.375 --> 45:56.583
I'm just a ghost.

45:57.083 --> 45:58.708
'Cause of what happened?

45:59.375 --> 46:01.833
Well, uh, it ruined my life.

46:01.916 --> 46:02.958
Of course.

46:06.375 --> 46:07.416
And, um...

46:07.958 --> 46:11.291
do you remember
the first time you found out?

46:12.125 --> 46:13.166
Yes.

46:13.750 --> 46:17.125
Yeah, Billy sat me down in my room
and told me.

46:17.708 --> 46:20.958
And, um, I just thought
he was trying to make me upset.

46:21.041 --> 46:23.500
So I went and found my dad,
and he said it was true.

46:25.333 --> 46:28.583
And he'd slammed his fist down
on his desk so hard that

46:28.666 --> 46:31.291
he'd split his hand open.
It was bleeding everywhere.

46:31.375 --> 46:34.375
And all this happened,
like, right before my birthday.

46:34.916 --> 46:37.958
So everyone forgot to cancel my party.

46:38.750 --> 46:41.041
But only one guy showed up anyway,

46:41.125 --> 46:44.291
and we just, um, hung out in my room,

46:44.375 --> 46:47.375
and I ate so many Warheads
that I threw up.

46:47.458 --> 46:48.625
And, um...

46:49.583 --> 46:51.666
we just watched TV
until the sun was almost up,

46:51.750 --> 46:55.541
then I gave him a hand job,
and then he never spoke to me again.

47:01.833 --> 47:03.583
Jonah, you can't fucking sing this!

47:04.375 --> 47:05.833
Oh my God. I gotta go.

47:05.916 --> 47:08.750
- It was really nice to meet you.
- Yeah, you too.

47:08.833 --> 47:09.666
Later.

47:11.208 --> 47:13.833
- Step away, bitches.
- It's all good. Don't worry.

47:13.916 --> 47:15.125
Ooh.

47:15.666 --> 47:20.416
As you can see, the
situation is not without its casualties.

47:21.291 --> 47:25.875
From what I've seen, she seems to be
pretty well-liked in the neighborhood,

47:25.958 --> 47:28.375
and she's busy with her baking, and...

47:28.458 --> 47:31.458
You might want to check
the names on those orders.

47:32.333 --> 47:34.916
It's a handful that keep
repeating over and over.

47:35.000 --> 47:36.416
My wife's one of them.

47:36.958 --> 47:41.250
So people are just ordering things
to keep her busy?

47:41.333 --> 47:44.708
Yeah. It's a kindness, you know.

47:45.333 --> 47:49.583
But, uh, how many pineapple
upside down cakes can a family eat?

47:49.666 --> 47:55.125
<i>♪ Well maybe you're just
Too blind to see ♪</i>

47:55.208 --> 47:56.500
<i>♪ I'm up on the tight... ♪</i>

48:12.666 --> 48:13.500
Hello?

48:21.833 --> 48:22.875
Hey, Dad.

48:24.708 --> 48:26.041
Hi.

48:32.125 --> 48:36.333
Gracie wanted to know how you're
planning on getting to the graduation.

48:38.083 --> 48:39.958
I'll drive myself.

48:40.541 --> 48:41.500
It's close.

48:56.416 --> 49:00.541
I can't believe the kids
are gonna be at college in the fall.

49:05.333 --> 49:06.500
An empty nest.

49:11.333 --> 49:14.500
You're gonna have more time
to focus on other things.

49:16.833 --> 49:17.666
Yeah.

50:25.458 --> 50:28.333
We're glad you're here.
Okay, settle.

50:29.625 --> 50:30.458
Cameron.

50:30.541 --> 50:34.791
This is the first time in my experience,
I've worked here 20 years,

50:34.875 --> 50:39.000
that a Juilliard-educated actor
has sat in this theater.

50:40.208 --> 50:41.625
Cameron, quit it.

50:42.625 --> 50:47.250
It's an incredible opportunity, so let's
ask some great questions, shall we?

50:55.416 --> 50:56.250
Yes?

50:56.750 --> 50:58.458
Have you acted in sex scenes?

50:59.833 --> 51:01.916
- You are staying late.
- Yes, I have.

51:02.000 --> 51:04.333
- You don't have to answer--
- No, it's fine. I have.

51:05.041 --> 51:07.625
And it's a strange part of acting.

51:08.291 --> 51:10.500
- Like what?
- Hm. Well...

51:11.750 --> 51:16.333
sometimes it's really mechanical,
like a choreographed dance,

51:16.416 --> 51:19.458
you know, where the only thing
you can focus on is

51:20.083 --> 51:23.375
where you're supposed to be, and when.

51:23.458 --> 51:24.541
And then

51:26.125 --> 51:31.250
sometimes there's real chemistry
between two people and you start

51:32.541 --> 51:34.125
feeling like it's real.

51:36.291 --> 51:39.916
In a strange way.
You'd never admit it to one another,

51:40.416 --> 51:45.583
but you're wearing practically nothing
and you're rubbing up against each other...

51:45.666 --> 51:46.875
...and sweating...

51:47.375 --> 51:49.125
...and it's for hours,

51:49.208 --> 51:52.958
and you start losing the line of, like,

51:53.791 --> 51:58.166
am I pretending that
I'm experiencing pleasure, or am I...

51:59.000 --> 52:02.166
Am I pretending
that I'm not experiencing pleasure?

52:03.208 --> 52:06.958
And the whole crew,
they're almost always all men.

52:07.041 --> 52:08.291
You feel them watching.

52:08.375 --> 52:11.500
And you feel them, like...
...holding their breath.

52:13.125 --> 52:15.458
And they try and hide it
when they swallow.

52:20.583 --> 52:23.500
You give in to the rhythm,
you know, every time.

52:24.833 --> 52:26.833
Tension never breaks.

52:32.208 --> 52:33.291
Kimme, yeah.

52:37.041 --> 52:40.500
- Uh, how... How do you choose your roles?
- Hmm.

52:42.541 --> 52:46.416
Well, when I'm lucky enough
to choose my roles, I...

52:47.791 --> 52:49.625
I wanna find...

52:51.000 --> 52:53.291
a character that's...

52:54.291 --> 52:59.416
That's difficult to...
to, on the surface, understand.

52:59.500 --> 53:03.666
I want... I want to take the person, I want
to figure out why are they like this.

53:03.750 --> 53:06.458
Were they born, or were they made?

53:06.541 --> 53:10.875
And that can run the gamut
from the more notorious to the...

53:10.958 --> 53:12.166
Just anyone.

53:13.625 --> 53:16.666
Why would you want to play someone
who you think is a bad person?

53:16.750 --> 53:19.375
Are you kidding?
I mean, pick any great role.

53:19.458 --> 53:23.291
Medea or Hedda Gabler, or...

53:23.375 --> 53:24.541
Tony Soprano.

53:25.625 --> 53:28.208
Precisely... Cameron.

53:29.500 --> 53:34.166
It's the complexity. It's the moral
grey areas that are interesting, right?

53:35.833 --> 53:36.708
Hm.

53:56.166 --> 53:58.583
I'm so sorry you're not feeling well.

54:20.291 --> 54:21.750
Now this is silly.

54:21.833 --> 54:24.250
This is actually very serious business.

54:24.750 --> 54:26.125
If you say so.

54:26.208 --> 54:27.541
Um...

54:28.375 --> 54:31.583
Okay, um, so this is, um...

54:32.208 --> 54:34.916
This is
the foundation that I use. Um...

54:35.000 --> 54:39.500
I have... I have some on now, so I'm not
gonna... I'm not going to put on anymore.

54:39.583 --> 54:40.458
Can I, uh...?

54:41.208 --> 54:42.041
Thank you.

54:42.125 --> 54:43.000
Um...

54:43.875 --> 54:44.875
And...

54:46.000 --> 54:48.916
this is the blush that I like.

54:49.000 --> 54:50.375
And I use a, um...

54:51.041 --> 54:53.666
Use a sponge to put it on, and...

54:54.541 --> 54:58.083
here's my favorite lip color.

54:58.833 --> 55:00.750
It looks like that. Um...

55:02.125 --> 55:03.291
I'll just...

55:04.875 --> 55:06.416
put a little of this on.

55:13.208 --> 55:16.291
You know, I think that it would
be better if I just did this to you.

55:24.458 --> 55:26.125
Okay.

55:34.291 --> 55:36.833
Bet you're used to this.

55:50.625 --> 55:52.625
So did you always want to be an actress?

55:55.500 --> 55:56.500
Always.

56:05.458 --> 56:07.208
I wanted to be on Broadway.

56:09.083 --> 56:11.750
And when I told my parents,
I was nine or ten,

56:12.833 --> 56:14.541
they were so disappointed.

56:15.750 --> 56:18.708
They said, "Honey,
you're so much smarter than that."

56:21.416 --> 56:22.625
What did you say?

56:26.000 --> 56:27.583
Are you smarter than that?

56:30.208 --> 56:32.166
I don't know.

56:32.250 --> 56:33.208
I don't know.

56:42.791 --> 56:44.208
What do your parents do?

56:46.875 --> 56:48.250
They're academics.

56:48.750 --> 56:52.625
My mother wrote
a pretty respected book on, uh...

56:54.166 --> 56:56.583
...epistemic relativism.

57:07.750 --> 57:08.833
My mother

57:10.666 --> 57:13.166
wrote a great recipe
for blueberry cobbler.

57:19.583 --> 57:21.125
What was your mother like?

57:25.666 --> 57:26.958
She was beautiful.

58:05.208 --> 58:06.458
Knock-knock.

58:07.333 --> 58:10.166
Sweetie, I was hoping you could
clear your bugs out of the living room.

58:10.250 --> 58:12.541
I wanna get the house ready
before Honor gets home.

58:12.625 --> 58:15.625
And, um, could you pick up
some takeout for dinner tonight?

58:15.708 --> 58:17.458
- I'm swamped.
- Sure.

58:20.541 --> 58:21.500
I can help.

58:22.750 --> 58:23.708
Okay.

58:31.125 --> 58:32.833
Oh, I love them.

58:33.500 --> 58:35.875
Hm. They're hungry this year.

58:36.458 --> 58:38.291
How long have you been doing this?

58:38.375 --> 58:39.416
A few years.

58:39.500 --> 58:44.291
I read this article about how
the monarch population is dwindling,

58:44.375 --> 58:46.958
and they mentioned that
people help raise them.

58:47.041 --> 58:47.875
Oh.

58:47.958 --> 58:51.333
I'm not the only one who does this.
Gracie makes it seem that way, but...

58:52.041 --> 58:53.291
How do you do it?

58:53.375 --> 58:56.208
- You just keep your eyes open.
- Mm-hmm.

58:56.291 --> 58:57.875
And look for the eggs.

58:57.958 --> 58:59.166
Take them inside.

58:59.666 --> 59:02.625
Protect them
so they have a chance to grow.

59:03.458 --> 59:07.666
We've had an actual impact.
The numbers are way up and...

59:07.750 --> 59:12.250
- Huh.
- ...I'm a part of this, uh, Facebook group.

59:12.333 --> 59:13.250
Hm.

59:13.333 --> 59:16.708
- Anyway, I know it sounds really dorky.
- Not at all.

59:18.333 --> 59:21.875
My friend Michela, who's in the group,
she lives in Durham...

59:22.875 --> 59:26.708
People put milkweed in the cages
for them to attach to,

59:26.791 --> 59:30.958
but she also puts these sticks in
for them to climb

59:31.041 --> 59:34.833
'cause some of them attach to the top part
of the mesh when they form the chrysalis,

59:34.916 --> 59:36.333
and hang upside-down.

59:36.416 --> 59:37.875
That's fascinating.

59:39.041 --> 59:40.958
So, um...

59:42.500 --> 59:46.291
- we have to grab these from the bottom.
- Mm-hmm.

59:46.833 --> 59:49.875
Be very careful
because of the chrysalises.

59:49.958 --> 59:51.125
- All right.
- Yeah.

59:52.208 --> 59:53.333
Here you go.

01:00:02.375 --> 01:00:05.250
This is a beautiful place to live.

01:00:05.791 --> 01:00:08.041
Yeah. It's been really nice.

01:00:08.666 --> 01:00:09.500
You okay?

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.625
Yes. Thank you.

01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:25.875
So, it's hard to tell what you
actually think about all this.

01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:28.708
Well...

01:00:30.750 --> 01:00:34.458
I think you have a very nice family.

01:00:35.416 --> 01:00:38.833
And you're both interesting people.

01:00:40.333 --> 01:00:41.416
Okay.

01:00:42.375 --> 01:00:44.291
I don't know. What do you think?

01:00:45.041 --> 01:00:48.125
I think it's hard to trust that. You know?

01:00:48.208 --> 01:00:51.375
That you're going to represent things
as they were.

01:00:51.458 --> 01:00:52.750
- Or--
- I'm gonna try.

01:00:57.625 --> 01:01:00.625
I don't know. It's hard to feel.

01:01:02.208 --> 01:01:08.291
People... they, like,
see me as, like, a victim, or something.

01:01:08.375 --> 01:01:13.291
I mean, we've been together
for almost 24 years now. Like...

01:01:13.958 --> 01:01:17.333
- Why would we do that if we weren't happy?
- Right.

01:01:23.250 --> 01:01:26.375
I was different than the other kids.

01:01:26.458 --> 01:01:29.000
- The people around me.
- Mm.

01:01:29.083 --> 01:01:30.666
And girls were never...

01:01:32.666 --> 01:01:34.666
But she was so...

01:01:36.625 --> 01:01:37.916
She saw me.

01:01:40.416 --> 01:01:41.250
Yeah.

01:01:47.291 --> 01:01:48.375
I wanted it.

01:01:53.625 --> 01:01:54.625
I don't know.

01:01:58.208 --> 01:01:59.750
What did your parents say?

01:02:00.583 --> 01:02:02.875
We never really talked about it.

01:02:02.958 --> 01:02:06.083
My dad was always so focused on his work,

01:02:06.875 --> 01:02:12.916
and my mom passed away when I was 20,
so we never got to really look back on it.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.875
- Well, I'm sorry.
- No, it's...

01:02:18.791 --> 01:02:22.625
It's hard to imagine what that
conversation would have been, honestly.

01:02:24.250 --> 01:02:25.750
I mean, you were so young

01:02:26.625 --> 01:02:28.625
to have so many eyes on you.

01:02:43.916 --> 01:02:45.708
Fuck.

01:03:06.291 --> 01:03:07.291
Gracie?

01:03:10.666 --> 01:03:11.833
What happened?

01:03:15.708 --> 01:03:17.458
Joyce in Mercer called

01:03:17.958 --> 01:03:19.958
and cancelled her order,

01:03:20.041 --> 01:03:21.625
and all future orders.

01:03:23.958 --> 01:03:25.166
I'm sorry.

01:03:25.250 --> 01:03:28.958
And I told her that I'd already made it,
and she said that she would pay for it,

01:03:29.041 --> 01:03:31.791
but that she didn't need it.
They were leaving town.

01:03:31.875 --> 01:03:34.916
- Where are they going?
- Her sister is sick or something.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:39.375
It doesn't matter.
I wasted hours that I could have used.

01:03:39.458 --> 01:03:41.375
You couldn't have known, Gracie.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.250
I just...
I hate things like that.

01:03:45.333 --> 01:03:48.625
And now I have this cake
that's going to go right in the garbage.

01:03:48.708 --> 01:03:50.708
You don't have to throw it in the garbage.

01:04:04.208 --> 01:04:05.583
Where were you?

01:04:07.166 --> 01:04:08.583
I took a walk.

01:04:08.666 --> 01:04:11.000
Showed Elizabeth the neighborhood.

01:04:11.083 --> 01:04:12.041
Ugh.

01:04:12.541 --> 01:04:13.458
Elizabeth.

01:04:17.708 --> 01:04:19.791
She's getting on my last nerve.

01:04:19.875 --> 01:04:20.708
Why?

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.791
She's just everywhere I look.

01:04:25.416 --> 01:04:27.666
- And for what?
- For the movie.

01:04:29.041 --> 01:04:31.958
So people can see it, and understand more.

01:04:32.666 --> 01:04:36.416
And maybe it's more easier for you?

01:04:37.833 --> 01:04:38.958
For me?

01:04:39.875 --> 01:04:41.041
For us.

01:04:42.166 --> 01:04:43.708
The both of us.

01:04:46.458 --> 01:04:47.333
Okay?

01:04:56.666 --> 01:04:57.708
I don't know.

01:04:58.958 --> 01:05:00.208
She'll be gone soon.

01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:26.500
Mmm.

01:05:28.291 --> 01:05:29.541
So good.

01:05:36.291 --> 01:05:40.666
I'm telling you, it's going
great. It's really, really helpful.

01:05:40.750 --> 01:05:43.500
<i>I'm very happy to hear this.
I think it's very good.</i>

01:05:44.291 --> 01:05:47.958
<i>But I wanted to ask because you're over
the number of days that we budgeted for.</i>

01:05:48.041 --> 01:05:54.083
Well, I guess that means the crew-wrap
sweatshirts have become crew-wrap mugs.

01:05:59.250 --> 01:06:01.250
Look, I know you trust me.

01:06:01.333 --> 01:06:02.375
<i>Of course I do.</i>

01:06:02.458 --> 01:06:07.250
And I feel like I'm getting really close
to something true.

01:06:08.125 --> 01:06:09.708
Something honest.

01:06:10.208 --> 01:06:12.583
<i>Okay. To Friday.</i>

01:06:13.666 --> 01:06:15.333
Thank you.

01:06:15.416 --> 01:06:17.000
<i>But that's it. I'm serious.</i>

01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:19.750
Uh-oh, he's serious.

01:06:19.833 --> 01:06:20.666
<i>I am.</i>

01:06:21.750 --> 01:06:22.833
How's your wife?

01:06:23.541 --> 01:06:25.458
<i>Elizabeth...</i>

01:06:25.958 --> 01:06:26.875
What?

01:06:26.958 --> 01:06:28.375
<i>You're reckless.</i>

01:06:30.583 --> 01:06:31.958
Is she home?

01:06:32.041 --> 01:06:33.750
<i>No, but you had no idea.</i>

01:06:36.750 --> 01:06:39.458
<i>She got hired in a televisions series
back in Rome, so...</i>

01:06:40.458 --> 01:06:42.250
<i>- she won't be on set.</i>
- Good.

01:06:51.916 --> 01:06:53.916
<i>- Did you watch the tapes?</i>
- I did.

01:06:54.833 --> 01:06:59.416
Look, I know, I'm sure they've seen
lots of people, but...

01:07:00.250 --> 01:07:01.875
...has it just been LA?

01:07:02.416 --> 01:07:04.625
Because the kids, they're cute,

01:07:05.125 --> 01:07:07.458
but not, like, sexy enough.

01:07:07.541 --> 01:07:11.458
You've seen him. I mean,
he's got this, like, quiet confidence.

01:07:11.541 --> 01:07:14.500
Even as a kid, I'm sure.

01:07:15.875 --> 01:07:16.833
<i>I think...</i>

01:07:18.541 --> 01:07:20.041
<i>you need to come home.</i>

01:07:28.375 --> 01:07:30.666
My God, it's so good to see you.

01:07:31.625 --> 01:07:34.666
- My God, you're as tall as me now.
- You look great.

01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:36.166
Let me grab this.

01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:41.583
Oh, I missed you.

01:07:46.916 --> 01:07:48.250
How's the roommate?

01:07:48.958 --> 01:07:52.375
- It's all good. We got over it.
- Good.

01:07:52.458 --> 01:07:53.791
I knew you would.

01:07:56.583 --> 01:07:57.500
How's Mom?

01:07:58.125 --> 01:07:59.708
Great. Busy.

01:08:03.208 --> 01:08:04.666
How's the actress?

01:08:13.250 --> 01:08:14.708
What's so funny?

01:08:23.208 --> 01:08:24.291
<i>Joey?</i>

01:08:25.750 --> 01:08:27.000


01:08:28.958 --> 01:08:30.125


01:08:31.916 --> 01:08:33.458


01:08:35.708 --> 01:08:36.875


01:08:39.208 --> 01:08:40.416
<i>Are you in there?</i>

01:08:44.833 --> 01:08:46.083
<i>You scared me.</i>

01:08:47.125 --> 01:08:49.458


01:08:54.458 --> 01:08:56.875


01:09:04.250 --> 01:09:05.583


01:09:11.333 --> 01:09:13.125
<i>You don't look scared to me.</i>

01:09:40.041 --> 01:09:41.833
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:09:42.666 --> 01:09:44.875
It's okay. You can come out.

01:09:56.250 --> 01:09:58.250
- How's it going?
- Fine.

01:10:03.333 --> 01:10:05.333
Are you excited about tomorrow?

01:10:05.916 --> 01:10:06.750
Sure.

01:10:08.791 --> 01:10:11.375
I can't believe
you and your sister are leaving.

01:10:11.458 --> 01:10:15.250
Yeah, I try to picture what it'll be like,
but... I can't.

01:10:16.166 --> 01:10:17.000
Yeah.

01:10:19.208 --> 01:10:20.208
Are you nervous?

01:10:21.333 --> 01:10:22.958
- About what?
- College.

01:10:24.041 --> 01:10:25.083
Leaving home.

01:10:27.166 --> 01:10:28.791
I can't wait to leave home.

01:10:30.208 --> 01:10:31.291
That's good.

01:10:31.375 --> 01:10:33.375
Yeah, I think that's good.

01:10:37.625 --> 01:10:39.916
So, you gonna be out here a while, or...

01:10:40.833 --> 01:10:42.125
Should I not be?

01:10:43.166 --> 01:10:44.125
Uh...

01:10:45.458 --> 01:10:46.833
I was just gonna...

01:10:47.541 --> 01:10:48.416
Oh...

01:10:50.208 --> 01:10:52.250
You should... Yeah, you should go ahead.

01:10:52.750 --> 01:10:53.708
Mm-hmm.

01:10:53.791 --> 01:10:54.750
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.

01:10:55.250 --> 01:10:56.083
Yeah.

01:10:57.416 --> 01:10:58.250
Okay.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.041
- You want?
- No. Thanks.

01:11:12.583 --> 01:11:13.500
Uh...

01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:15.208
I've never...

01:11:16.166 --> 01:11:17.375
I've never done that.

01:11:18.583 --> 01:11:19.458
What?

01:11:22.250 --> 01:11:24.250
No, Dad, that's crazy.

01:11:28.083 --> 01:11:30.125
Um... Here.

01:11:31.791 --> 01:11:33.375
You definitely don't have to.

01:11:33.875 --> 01:11:34.708
Yeah.

01:11:47.791 --> 01:11:49.708
You don't...

01:11:55.875 --> 01:11:57.875
I'm fine.

01:12:02.375 --> 01:12:03.375
I'm fine.

01:12:22.750 --> 01:12:24.125
This is nice.

01:12:24.625 --> 01:12:25.458
Yeah.

01:12:37.250 --> 01:12:39.250
Well, don't you look nice.

01:12:39.333 --> 01:12:40.458
Thank you.

01:12:42.833 --> 01:12:43.666
Hey.

01:12:44.583 --> 01:12:45.875
You're early.

01:12:45.958 --> 01:12:47.958
- Am I?
- You ready to bake?

01:12:51.083 --> 01:12:53.416
This is my brother Bill's favorite cake.

01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:54.541
Is this for him?

01:12:54.625 --> 01:12:57.125
No, he's in Minneapolis.
He works for the Twins.

01:12:57.208 --> 01:12:58.333
Which twins?

01:12:58.875 --> 01:13:00.500
It's a professional baseball team.

01:13:00.583 --> 01:13:02.625
- Oh, of course.
- Mm-hmm.

01:13:02.708 --> 01:13:05.625
He was captain of the baseball team
in high school,

01:13:05.708 --> 01:13:09.458
and then he played college ball, and
now he's a professional pitching coach.

01:13:10.541 --> 01:13:13.833
I'm gonna spread it around
in the bottom like this.

01:13:13.916 --> 01:13:16.541
He was always so protective
of me growing up,

01:13:16.625 --> 01:13:18.083
even though he was younger.

01:13:18.583 --> 01:13:21.791
Whenever boys would get near me,
he'd throw them up against the locker,

01:13:21.875 --> 01:13:23.750
and say, "What are your intentions?"

01:13:24.625 --> 01:13:26.916
What were their intentions?

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:30.458
Okay, now,
you are going to put the cherries

01:13:31.833 --> 01:13:33.333
at the bottom of the pan...

01:13:35.791 --> 01:13:36.875
like this.

01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:41.833
And do it nicely, because
it really does matter how it looks.

01:13:55.375 --> 01:13:57.583
- That's very nice.
- Thank you.

01:14:02.791 --> 01:14:05.791
You know, Joe's been
with more women than I have men.

01:14:07.083 --> 01:14:08.250
Is that right?

01:14:08.333 --> 01:14:10.375
Nobody seems to remember that.

01:14:10.458 --> 01:14:12.166
I'd only been with Tom.

01:14:13.125 --> 01:14:15.583
But Joe'd been with two girls before me.

01:14:17.291 --> 01:14:19.291
When he was in the seventh grade?

01:14:19.791 --> 01:14:22.750
He led a very different life than me.

01:14:23.416 --> 01:14:26.500
His father was always working,
so he was the man of the house,

01:14:26.583 --> 01:14:30.916
and he took care of his little sisters
pretty much on his own.

01:14:31.875 --> 01:14:33.875
One of them had terrible asthma.

01:14:36.875 --> 01:14:38.875
He grew up very quickly.

01:14:42.375 --> 01:14:44.041
And I was very sheltered.

01:14:55.041 --> 01:14:56.625
I wanna show you something.

01:14:59.875 --> 01:15:00.791
Um...

01:15:01.291 --> 01:15:03.416
Joe gave this to me back then.

01:15:03.916 --> 01:15:05.250
I think it's lovely.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:12.041
"Peace is sitting
on a lake in the summertime."

01:15:12.833 --> 01:15:16.041
"Peace is a Coca-Cola
on a hot summer day."

01:15:16.666 --> 01:15:19.583
"Peace is being with you."

01:15:20.750 --> 01:15:23.000
The assignment was "What is peace?"

01:15:28.791 --> 01:15:30.875
You're such a special person.

01:15:30.958 --> 01:15:34.125
Dad, please, stop. This is so weird.

01:15:34.208 --> 01:15:35.458
I really mean it.

01:15:35.541 --> 01:15:37.000
Are you boys up there?

01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:38.333
Yeah.

01:15:38.416 --> 01:15:41.375
Garibaldi's said they can take us at 7:00.
How does that sound?

01:15:41.958 --> 01:15:44.750
That sounds great. Thanks, Mom.

01:15:49.833 --> 01:15:50.875
Joe!

01:15:53.458 --> 01:15:55.458
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay.

01:15:56.875 --> 01:15:59.791
I was just thinking, what if...

01:16:00.833 --> 01:16:02.791
- I had...
- Honey, I.. I can't hear you.

01:16:02.875 --> 01:16:06.875
- ...to take my own X-rays.
- I can't hear what you're saying.

01:16:07.791 --> 01:16:10.458
Everything's fine.
We'll meet you down there in a second.

01:16:13.625 --> 01:16:15.666
Maybe this wasn't the best idea.

01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:17.708
I feel like
everything's so fucked up.

01:16:17.791 --> 01:16:19.625
It's not, Dad. It's all right.

01:16:19.708 --> 01:16:22.916
- I just want you to have a good life.
- I will.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:24.166
Because...

01:16:29.541 --> 01:16:32.000
Because...

01:16:32.083 --> 01:16:34.500
...bad things, they happen.

01:16:34.583 --> 01:16:37.666
And we do bad things also.

01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:40.750
And we have to think about those things.

01:16:41.708 --> 01:16:44.416
If we try not to think about it,
there's this...

01:16:46.791 --> 01:16:49.333
- Do you know what I mean?
- Yeah, I know, Dad.

01:16:49.416 --> 01:16:51.625
God, I can't tell if we're connecting

01:16:51.708 --> 01:16:55.833
or if I'm creating a bad memory for you
in real time, but I can't help it.

01:16:55.916 --> 01:16:58.375
No, we're connecting, Dad. It's okay.

01:16:58.458 --> 01:16:59.625
It's okay.

01:17:02.916 --> 01:17:04.416
Don't worry about me.

01:17:08.625 --> 01:17:09.916
It's all I do.

01:17:13.791 --> 01:17:17.458
I'm so glad that Honor
was able to finish her finals in time

01:17:17.541 --> 01:17:20.291
to come home to watch our beautiful Mary,

01:17:20.375 --> 01:17:24.500
and our gentle Charlie
walk across that stage tomorrow.

01:17:24.583 --> 01:17:27.708
I couldn't be prouder of both of you.

01:17:28.958 --> 01:17:32.125
And to Joe, the man of my life,

01:17:32.708 --> 01:17:36.083
here's to entering
this next phase together.

01:17:36.166 --> 01:17:40.541
As our little ones fly away from the nest,
they know they can always come home.

01:17:41.291 --> 01:17:43.166
Cheers.

01:17:44.166 --> 01:17:45.125
Cheers.

01:17:45.625 --> 01:17:46.458
Cheers.

01:17:47.375 --> 01:17:48.250
Cheers.

01:17:49.208 --> 01:17:50.500
You forgot someone.

01:17:53.041 --> 01:17:58.083
Elizabeth, we're so happy you could
be with us at this very special time.

01:17:58.166 --> 01:17:59.250
Thank you.

01:17:59.958 --> 01:18:00.958
Cheers.

01:18:03.541 --> 01:18:06.083
- Mm. This is delicious.
- Mm.

01:18:09.041 --> 01:18:12.541
Honor, when we get home, I'll show you
what we got your sister for graduation.

01:18:14.833 --> 01:18:16.041
Is it a scale?

01:18:16.125 --> 01:18:17.166
Excuse me?

01:18:17.250 --> 01:18:19.000
When I graduated, you got me a scale.

01:18:20.083 --> 01:18:23.041
That was just part of setting you up
at your new place.

01:18:23.125 --> 01:18:25.625
You know perfectly well that
wasn't your graduation present.

01:18:25.708 --> 01:18:27.125
It came wrapped in a bow.

01:18:27.208 --> 01:18:30.416
We got her a necklace
with her birthstone in it.

01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:33.583
Just like we got your sister.
But I see you're not wearing yours.

01:18:41.416 --> 01:18:42.916
When do you start shooting this movie?

01:18:43.833 --> 01:18:45.375
In about three weeks.

01:18:45.958 --> 01:18:47.750
It's soon. Hm.

01:18:50.041 --> 01:18:52.375
- Wish you weren't doing that.
- Honor.

01:18:52.958 --> 01:18:55.041
I can understand that. Of course.

01:18:55.541 --> 01:18:59.458
I hope in the end that you'll feel
it had something to say,

01:19:00.083 --> 01:19:02.500
and that we captured something true.

01:19:04.333 --> 01:19:08.000
True like how it isn't awkward at all
that you're at this graduation dinner?

01:19:08.083 --> 01:19:09.625
- Joe, can you--
- What?

01:19:09.708 --> 01:19:11.375
- Can you do something?
- Like what?

01:19:11.458 --> 01:19:12.875
Thanks for your help.

01:19:12.958 --> 01:19:17.583
Um, Honor, I got you that scale,
as I told you at the time, as a tradition,

01:19:17.666 --> 01:19:20.750
because that's what my mother got me
when I graduated from high school.

01:19:20.833 --> 01:19:23.833
You try going through life
without a scale. See how that goes.

01:19:23.916 --> 01:19:24.833
Mom.

01:19:24.916 --> 01:19:27.041
- Hi.
- Cassidy. Hi.

01:19:27.125 --> 01:19:28.583
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, Grandma.

01:19:28.666 --> 01:19:30.166
Hi. Oh, hello. Hi.

01:19:30.750 --> 01:19:34.125
Oh, hi, sweetheart.
Oh, you look so pretty.

01:19:34.208 --> 01:19:38.083
Oh my goodness. Peter, congratulations.

01:19:38.916 --> 01:19:42.500
Billie, Tyler, Georgie, hi.
Everyone's celebrating of course.

01:19:42.583 --> 01:19:44.583
Yeah, it's just the best.

01:19:44.666 --> 01:19:47.000
- Very nice to see you again.
- Yes, you as well.

01:19:48.916 --> 01:19:50.000
Tom.

01:19:51.833 --> 01:19:54.458
Okay, I think we'll head
over to our table.

01:19:54.541 --> 01:19:56.625
Yeah, we're in the back
with the old families.

01:19:57.708 --> 01:19:59.250
- Georgie.
- Yeah.

01:19:59.333 --> 01:20:01.708
- See you at graduation.
- All right, bye.

01:20:02.291 --> 01:20:05.000
Uh, I'm a really big fan of <i>Norah's Ark.</i>

01:20:05.083 --> 01:20:07.750
Thank you. That means the world.

01:20:13.583 --> 01:20:15.583
Firmly frozen by now.

01:20:35.333 --> 01:20:37.833
My brother Mark,
he still lives in Richmond.

01:20:39.166 --> 01:20:43.666
He always says, "Keep your expectations
low, and you'll never be disappointed."

01:20:44.750 --> 01:20:46.083
And I always forget that.

01:20:46.166 --> 01:20:48.583
How many brothers do you have?

01:20:48.666 --> 01:20:49.666
Four.

01:20:50.875 --> 01:20:52.000
Two older.

01:20:52.541 --> 01:20:53.666
Two younger.

01:20:55.166 --> 01:20:56.708
But I think you know that.

01:21:01.125 --> 01:21:02.125
So...

01:21:03.125 --> 01:21:05.500
what were your expectations?

01:21:06.333 --> 01:21:09.333
Uh, that tonight would go well.

01:21:10.041 --> 01:21:11.875
That my children would love me.

01:21:13.125 --> 01:21:14.916
And my life would be perfect.

01:21:15.416 --> 01:21:16.833
That was a little naive.

01:21:19.041 --> 01:21:20.416
I am naive.

01:21:21.708 --> 01:21:23.250
I always have been.

01:21:24.916 --> 01:21:26.625
In a way, it's been a gift.

01:21:36.041 --> 01:21:39.083
Is it all right if Joe drops us off first?

01:21:39.166 --> 01:21:41.416
I think the girls need a minute.

01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:44.458
- I can just walk from here.
- Mm-mm. He'll drive you.

01:21:53.541 --> 01:21:55.375
- Could I bum another cigarette?
- Yeah.

01:21:56.125 --> 01:21:56.958
There you go.

01:21:59.250 --> 01:22:02.083
Alice hung from this tree...

01:22:02.166 --> 01:22:05.958
- They said they're in the back.
- ...for three days, before she died.

01:22:06.958 --> 01:22:10.791
Come this way.
We'll show you the exact tree...

01:22:10.875 --> 01:22:12.041
Good evening.

01:22:14.250 --> 01:22:16.583
They went
to go find her body.

01:22:19.083 --> 01:22:21.083
Has she broken your spirit yet?

01:22:21.166 --> 01:22:24.625
No, just tired.

01:22:29.541 --> 01:22:31.541
Did you crack the case?

01:22:32.666 --> 01:22:36.708
Do you mind blowing your smoke
in the other direction, please? Thank you.

01:22:44.125 --> 01:22:45.083
Wanna know my theory?

01:22:46.875 --> 01:22:47.791
Sure.

01:22:49.458 --> 01:22:50.666
Childhood trauma.

01:22:51.791 --> 01:22:52.791
Which one?

01:22:54.708 --> 01:22:55.708
The big one.

01:22:57.208 --> 01:22:58.291
What do you mean?

01:23:00.666 --> 01:23:02.250
Her older brothers...

01:23:03.583 --> 01:23:05.666
- What?
- Yeah.

01:23:07.625 --> 01:23:08.958
Started when she was 12.

01:23:10.208 --> 01:23:11.208
On and off.

01:23:19.583 --> 01:23:22.791
Just don't mention it to her, obviously.
She doesn't talk about it.

01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:28.750
I read it in her diary,
but this was, like, way before.

01:23:30.166 --> 01:23:31.166
That's...

01:23:34.625 --> 01:23:35.916
Explains a lot.

01:23:37.833 --> 01:23:39.833
Why does she still talk to them?

01:23:41.125 --> 01:23:44.541
Lady, she's messed up in the head.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

01:23:46.416 --> 01:23:47.500
Oh, God.

01:23:48.750 --> 01:23:50.750
Listen, actually, I had an idea.

01:23:52.041 --> 01:23:54.833
- I was looking up how y'all make movies.
- Mm-hmm.

01:23:54.916 --> 01:23:56.041
And...

01:23:57.083 --> 01:24:01.291
I read about this job of,
um, music supervisor.

01:24:03.958 --> 01:24:05.958
- Yeah?
- I could do this job.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:11.125
Pick out songs for movies?
I would pick great songs.

01:24:13.375 --> 01:24:14.791
What are you asking?

01:24:14.875 --> 01:24:15.916
So, what if...

01:24:16.916 --> 01:24:20.791
in exchange for my memories,
my consultation,

01:24:20.875 --> 01:24:22.833
my willingness not to go to the press

01:24:22.916 --> 01:24:25.666
and talk disparagingly
about it and you and her,

01:24:26.166 --> 01:24:28.958
you give me this position
of music supervisor.

01:24:29.916 --> 01:24:31.208
On this movie.

01:24:31.291 --> 01:24:32.250
Um...

01:24:36.291 --> 01:24:38.875
I'll look into that for you.

01:24:43.833 --> 01:24:44.791
Thank you.

01:25:06.125 --> 01:25:09.958
And I think I've outstayed
my welcome here.

01:25:16.708 --> 01:25:18.708
My sister had really bad asthma.

01:25:20.083 --> 01:25:20.958
Did she?

01:25:21.458 --> 01:25:25.166
Yeah, she was always having to
do that breathing machine thing.

01:25:25.250 --> 01:25:27.166
Yeah, nebulizer.

01:25:27.250 --> 01:25:28.083
Right.

01:25:34.083 --> 01:25:35.333
I actually

01:25:36.083 --> 01:25:37.875
have one with me here.

01:25:37.958 --> 01:25:41.166
A new one,
and I can't figure out how to get the,

01:25:41.250 --> 01:25:44.833
you know the mouthpiece thing, to snap on.

01:25:44.916 --> 01:25:46.291
It's so stupid.

01:25:46.375 --> 01:25:48.208
I'd really like to use it.

01:25:48.708 --> 01:25:50.291
That's irritating.

01:25:51.125 --> 01:25:53.500
You just sort of have to

01:25:54.083 --> 01:25:55.875
- get the top, and--
- Could you...

01:25:56.666 --> 01:25:58.708
Do you... Do you have a second?

01:26:10.583 --> 01:26:13.000
They haven't changed this machine
since the '80s.

01:26:34.041 --> 01:26:35.125
Thank you.

01:26:36.083 --> 01:26:37.250
You saved my life.

01:26:39.416 --> 01:26:40.291
Sure.

01:26:43.916 --> 01:26:44.750
I...

01:26:45.833 --> 01:26:47.750
wanted to give you something.

01:26:48.541 --> 01:26:51.250
It's the only one I could save.

01:26:52.083 --> 01:26:53.708
Oh my God.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.708
Don't read it now.

01:27:12.750 --> 01:27:14.000
Thank you.

01:27:28.291 --> 01:27:29.916
You're so young.

01:27:31.125 --> 01:27:32.208
Believe me.

01:27:33.541 --> 01:27:35.083
You could start over.

01:27:37.833 --> 01:27:38.916
And do what?

01:27:40.458 --> 01:27:41.500
Anything.

01:28:41.708 --> 01:28:43.208
I'll get us a towel.

01:28:58.208 --> 01:28:59.333
Thanks.

01:29:00.916 --> 01:29:02.291
Let's get in bed.

01:29:14.291 --> 01:29:15.208
Wow.

01:29:15.291 --> 01:29:16.583
That was crazy.

01:29:17.958 --> 01:29:18.875
Yeah.

01:29:20.875 --> 01:29:22.750
Have you ever done that before?

01:29:24.750 --> 01:29:26.708
Right. 'Course.

01:29:27.458 --> 01:29:30.750
- What about you?
- No.

01:29:30.833 --> 01:29:34.625
I mean, I've had crushes on people.

01:29:34.708 --> 01:29:35.750
I think that's allowed.

01:29:35.833 --> 01:29:37.083
I don't know.

01:29:38.125 --> 01:29:39.625
Um, any of it.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.666
It would, uh, kill her.

01:29:43.750 --> 01:29:45.458
You know, she's very loyal.

01:29:46.083 --> 01:29:47.125
With me.

01:29:51.208 --> 01:29:52.041
Listen...

01:29:54.750 --> 01:29:57.041
whatever happens, she's gonna be okay,

01:29:57.625 --> 01:29:59.750
- People like Gracie--
- No, she won't.

01:30:00.916 --> 01:30:04.500
- No. You really don't know her.
- Okay.

01:30:12.333 --> 01:30:14.333
Let me tell you something.

01:30:15.916 --> 01:30:20.375
Your responsibility,
ultimately, is to yourself.

01:30:20.458 --> 01:30:21.333
Grace...

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:27.750
Elizabeth, I think
it's a little more complicated than that.

01:30:30.208 --> 01:30:33.250
You're gonna do what you're gonna do,
but...

01:30:33.333 --> 01:30:35.291
- ...stories like these--
- Stories?

01:30:36.083 --> 01:30:38.541
- Stories?
- You know what I mean.

01:30:38.625 --> 01:30:39.875
- Instances.
- This is--

01:30:39.958 --> 01:30:42.125
Severely traumatic beginnings--

01:30:42.208 --> 01:30:45.833
This isn't a story!
This is my fucking life!

01:30:48.375 --> 01:30:51.375
- Jesus.
- No need to get so worked up about it.

01:30:52.791 --> 01:30:55.000
I thought you...

01:30:55.708 --> 01:31:00.291
actually liked me,
and that we had a connection.

01:31:00.375 --> 01:31:01.875
I like you.

01:31:04.333 --> 01:31:06.333
Then what was this about?

01:31:09.333 --> 01:31:11.750
This is just what grown-ups do.

01:32:21.458 --> 01:32:23.333
You're lucky I'm not jumpy.

01:32:23.875 --> 01:32:24.791
I'm sorry.

01:32:27.916 --> 01:32:29.666
Why are you sitting there?

01:32:30.916 --> 01:32:33.958
I've just been thinking.

01:32:37.625 --> 01:32:38.666
Okay.

01:32:48.625 --> 01:32:55.583
I think there are a lot of things
we haven't talked about in a long time.

01:32:56.666 --> 01:32:57.708
Maybe ever.

01:33:00.166 --> 01:33:01.708
What kind of things?

01:33:04.125 --> 01:33:06.083
Things about our relationship.

01:33:08.541 --> 01:33:11.750
Well, I'm not gonna cross-examine you,
say what you wanna say.

01:33:15.041 --> 01:33:17.791
I've just been remembering things.

01:33:24.500 --> 01:33:25.958
What brought this on?

01:33:26.875 --> 01:33:28.250
What does it matter?

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:32.416
Is it the actress?

01:33:34.250 --> 01:33:35.416
Maybe.

01:33:35.500 --> 01:33:38.041
I don't know. I don't see
what difference it makes.

01:33:38.125 --> 01:33:40.625
It's how... What I'm feeling.

01:33:41.666 --> 01:33:43.166
Come and sit by me.

01:33:44.666 --> 01:33:45.666
Okay?

01:33:52.458 --> 01:33:53.625
Come on, baby.

01:33:54.625 --> 01:33:56.625
What's making you feel bad?

01:33:56.708 --> 01:33:57.791
It's not...

01:33:57.875 --> 01:34:00.666
I don't feel bad, like...

01:34:01.166 --> 01:34:03.791
I'm just trying to say...

01:34:08.166 --> 01:34:10.041
What if I wasn't

01:34:10.625 --> 01:34:13.541
ready to be making
those kinds of decisions.

01:34:14.708 --> 01:34:15.916
Then... Then what?

01:34:16.791 --> 01:34:19.416
Because the kids.

01:34:22.166 --> 01:34:23.500
What would that mean?

01:34:24.583 --> 01:34:26.833
I don't understand what you're saying.

01:34:30.166 --> 01:34:32.916
I'm saying, what if I was too young?

01:34:34.791 --> 01:34:35.625
Well...

01:34:39.833 --> 01:34:41.416
You seduced me.

01:34:43.375 --> 01:34:46.208
- But I was 13 years old.
- Don't give me that.

01:34:46.291 --> 01:34:49.208
- But I was.
- I don't care how old you were.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:51.625
Who was in charge?

01:34:53.625 --> 01:34:55.500
- What?
- Who was the boss?

01:34:57.541 --> 01:34:59.166
Who was in charge?

01:35:00.708 --> 01:35:02.458
Who was in charge?

01:35:03.583 --> 01:35:06.791
- I'm just trying to talk about something...
- I think that this movie is...

01:35:06.875 --> 01:35:09.625
- ...and you're not listening!
- ...dredging up all this stuff.

01:35:09.708 --> 01:35:11.041
Driving Elizabeth around.

01:35:11.125 --> 01:35:13.291
It's not about
the fucking movie!

01:35:13.375 --> 01:35:16.708
- No!
- I'm very sympathetic,

01:35:16.791 --> 01:35:18.375
but you're starting to upset me.

01:35:18.458 --> 01:35:21.625
You have not been sympathetic.
Why can't we talk about it?

01:35:22.916 --> 01:35:25.458
If we're really as in love
as we say we are,

01:35:25.541 --> 01:35:27.625
if we have that rare...

01:35:27.708 --> 01:35:30.333
Shouldn't I be able
to talk about this with you?

01:35:30.416 --> 01:35:33.166
"If we're really as in love
as we say we are?"

01:35:33.250 --> 01:35:35.333
Gracie, you know what I mean.
I'm begging you.

01:35:35.416 --> 01:35:39.000
No! "If we're really as in love
as we say we are?"

01:35:39.083 --> 01:35:41.875
I need you to help me. Please.

01:35:41.958 --> 01:35:46.333
"If we're really as in love was we say..."
I... It's graduation.

01:36:18.375 --> 01:36:20.208
My love...

01:36:22.833 --> 01:36:23.875
after you left tonight,

01:36:23.958 --> 01:36:27.875
I thought about the kind of life
we could have if things were different.

01:36:30.583 --> 01:36:34.166
If I'd been born later, or you long ago.

01:36:36.375 --> 01:36:38.750
But who knows what
we would have been like then.

01:36:38.833 --> 01:36:40.041
Or where.

01:36:40.125 --> 01:36:43.125
What tragedies
we'd have to face along the way.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:45.416
What bad luck.

01:36:48.666 --> 01:36:51.166
This is not what I ever would have wanted.

01:36:51.916 --> 01:36:54.375
But I'm so... grateful

01:36:55.833 --> 01:36:58.666
that our paths led us to this road.

01:37:01.625 --> 01:37:03.500
No matter what the cost.

01:37:06.958 --> 01:37:08.458
I think about you

01:37:09.375 --> 01:37:10.625
all the time.

01:37:13.541 --> 01:37:15.541
And the feeling I get when

01:37:16.333 --> 01:37:18.333
we look each other in the eyes.

01:37:19.666 --> 01:37:21.166
Do you feel that too?

01:37:24.500 --> 01:37:27.791
I know you don't have much
to compare it to, but...

01:37:29.083 --> 01:37:30.791
let me assure you

01:37:32.750 --> 01:37:34.083
it is rare.

01:37:36.125 --> 01:37:38.208
I've gone my whole life without it.

01:37:39.583 --> 01:37:44.125
And now that I've found it,
I can't imagine going back and pretending.

01:37:46.791 --> 01:37:49.000
Sometimes I wish we'd never met,

01:37:49.083 --> 01:37:51.625
or that you didn't get the job
in the pet shop at least,

01:37:51.708 --> 01:37:55.875
because I know that our lives will be
forever changed because of this.

01:37:55.958 --> 01:37:59.083
No matter how it all turns out.

01:37:59.166 --> 01:38:02.125
I know that my husband and my children...

01:38:03.916 --> 01:38:05.208
I...

01:38:08.666 --> 01:38:09.666
I know that...

01:38:12.458 --> 01:38:14.458
this will affect them too.

01:38:16.583 --> 01:38:18.291
My hope is that we can...

01:38:20.041 --> 01:38:24.250
keep our secrets long enough until
at least we're in no danger from the law.

01:38:25.250 --> 01:38:28.833
Maybe by then I'll have enough time
to end things cleanly,

01:38:28.916 --> 01:38:32.791
and to make sure that the children
know that I love them.

01:38:34.791 --> 01:38:37.958
And maybe by then
we'll have figured out what to say.

01:38:46.333 --> 01:38:48.083
When this first started...

01:38:50.083 --> 01:38:51.833
...I didn't know what to think.

01:38:53.583 --> 01:38:55.875
I knew that we'd crossed a line,

01:38:55.958 --> 01:38:59.708
and I felt in my heart
that we would cross it again.

01:39:00.708 --> 01:39:03.250
But now I think...

01:39:05.583 --> 01:39:08.041
I've lost track of where the line is.

01:39:10.041 --> 01:39:12.416
Who even draws these lines?

01:39:15.666 --> 01:39:16.958
All I know...

01:39:18.541 --> 01:39:21.791
is that I love you and you love me.

01:39:24.875 --> 01:39:27.333
And you gave me so much pleasure tonight.

01:39:27.416 --> 01:39:29.208
I hope I did the same for you.

01:39:33.875 --> 01:39:35.250
I'll see you Saturday.

01:39:36.333 --> 01:39:40.583
Please burn this. You know what could
happen to me if anyone ever found it.

01:39:44.291 --> 01:39:46.916
Your... Gracie.

01:40:04.666 --> 01:40:06.833
<i>This is River Street,
downtown Savannah.</i>

01:40:06.916 --> 01:40:09.500
<i>The rain is moving in from the west
and taking over.</i>

01:40:09.583 --> 01:40:12.916
<i>And as Lee was talking about,
we want the rain to come down.</i>

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.958
<i>It cools off the environment,
it cools off the atmosphere,</i>

01:40:16.041 --> 01:40:18.125
<i>and that helps to bring in more stability.</i>

01:40:18.208 --> 01:40:21.375
<i>So that these thunderstorms
that have been so nasty and so strong,</i>

01:40:21.458 --> 01:40:23.083
<i>will actually start to get weaker.</i>

01:40:23.166 --> 01:40:28.166
<i>Let's go right to our radar
because it's a huge storm system...</i>

01:41:40.166 --> 01:41:41.333
Hey.

01:41:47.666 --> 01:41:49.000
Oh, hi.

01:42:33.458 --> 01:42:34.458
Hey!

01:42:39.916 --> 01:42:41.416
Wow.

01:42:41.500 --> 01:42:42.875
You look so great.

01:42:43.541 --> 01:42:44.375
Thanks.

01:42:48.666 --> 01:42:50.583
Are you hungry?

01:42:51.083 --> 01:42:52.000
No.

01:42:52.833 --> 01:42:54.833
- Maybe a coffee?
- Coffee?

01:42:54.916 --> 01:42:56.458
That's new.

01:42:57.916 --> 01:42:59.916
Happy graduation.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
Yes. So exciting.

01:43:03.291 --> 01:43:05.708
- Look at you.
- Mm. Mom's gonna hate it.

01:43:05.791 --> 01:43:07.000
No, she's gonna love it.

01:43:07.083 --> 01:43:10.208
No, she's gonna love <i>this.</i>
Did she pick this one?

01:43:10.291 --> 01:43:11.666
- She did.
- Big day.

01:43:12.833 --> 01:43:15.250
Yeah, it is.

01:43:15.333 --> 01:43:16.541
What time is it?

01:43:16.625 --> 01:43:19.958
Uh, we should leave
in 20-25 minutes.

01:43:20.958 --> 01:43:22.625
I'll go up and get changed.

01:43:23.500 --> 01:43:26.208
Um, where's Mom?

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:28.166
I don't know, honestly.

01:43:28.250 --> 01:43:30.875
Maybe she had a beauty parlor appointment.

01:44:14.916 --> 01:44:16.083
Yeah!

01:44:22.291 --> 01:44:23.916
All right, this is it.

01:44:24.583 --> 01:44:26.250
I'll park and find your mom.

01:44:26.875 --> 01:44:29.125
- Okay, see you after.
- Thanks, Dad.

01:44:30.041 --> 01:44:31.625
Hey! How are you?

01:44:33.375 --> 01:44:34.666
Hey, you made it!

01:44:44.166 --> 01:44:47.083
To my fellow graduates
of the class of '15, go Sharks...

01:44:48.916 --> 01:44:51.250

always been smooth sailing,

01:44:51.333 --> 01:44:53.083
I know that our futures are bright.

01:44:53.166 --> 01:44:57.333
And with that,
I present to you the 2015 graduating class

01:44:57.416 --> 01:44:59.375

01:46:02.375 --> 01:46:03.416
Go Sharks!

01:46:36.958 --> 01:46:38.750
That was beautiful, wasn't it?

01:46:39.458 --> 01:46:40.583
It was.

01:46:42.625 --> 01:46:45.750
Well, heading to the airport now.

01:46:45.833 --> 01:46:47.458
That's probably for the best.

01:46:49.666 --> 01:46:53.375
I wonder if any of this
will have really mattered for your movie.

01:46:54.458 --> 01:46:55.666
I think it will.

01:46:58.125 --> 01:46:59.333
You understand me?

01:47:01.458 --> 01:47:02.458
I do.

01:47:05.416 --> 01:47:09.083
I hope you didn't think
that disgusting brother thing was real.

01:47:09.666 --> 01:47:10.500
What?

01:47:11.083 --> 01:47:12.166
It's disgusting.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.958
I don't know what he's doing
telling you these things.

01:47:16.458 --> 01:47:17.625
He told you?

01:47:18.541 --> 01:47:20.416
I talk to Georgie every day.

01:47:23.625 --> 01:47:27.458
Insecure people are very dangerous,
aren't they?

01:47:31.958 --> 01:47:33.208
I'm secure.

01:47:34.458 --> 01:47:36.375
Make sure you put that in there.

01:48:03.291 --> 01:48:05.750
Settle in, guys.
Here we go. Pictures off.

01:48:06.250 --> 01:48:08.041
- Cameras on!
- Here we go.

01:48:08.125 --> 01:48:09.041
Hold board.

01:48:09.125 --> 01:48:11.583
Just bring it up a little.
It's a little dark.

01:48:12.166 --> 01:48:13.583
Thank you.

01:48:13.666 --> 01:48:17.041
- Settle in, guys. Very still. Very quiet.
- Very still, please.

01:48:17.125 --> 01:48:18.833
Forty-two, take one, sound, speed.

01:48:19.333 --> 01:48:21.875
- Okay. Marker.
- A-camera, mark.

01:48:21.958 --> 01:48:24.000
And bring in the snake.

01:48:24.791 --> 01:48:26.125
- And set.
- Set.

01:48:26.208 --> 01:48:27.625
And we are set.

01:48:29.333 --> 01:48:31.000
And action.

01:48:32.125 --> 01:48:34.125
- Are you scared?
- No.

01:48:34.208 --> 01:48:35.666
It's okay to be scared.

01:48:36.166 --> 01:48:37.125
I'm not.

01:48:37.791 --> 01:48:39.083
She doesn't bite.

01:48:40.750 --> 01:48:41.791
How do you know?

01:48:43.708 --> 01:48:45.250
She's not that kind of snake.

01:48:47.083 --> 01:48:49.125
Okay, I think we go again.
We do a series...

01:48:49.208 --> 01:48:50.500
We're gonna find something.

01:48:50.583 --> 01:48:52.125
Guys, let's go back to one.

01:48:52.208 --> 01:48:54.583
Back to one. Places, please.

01:48:54.666 --> 01:48:56.291
- I got it.
- Stepping in.

01:48:58.125 --> 01:48:59.166
Is that all?

01:49:02.125 --> 01:49:03.333
And...

01:49:05.458 --> 01:49:07.625
- Get set.
- We are set.

01:49:08.875 --> 01:49:09.958
And action.

01:49:13.458 --> 01:49:14.500
Are you scared?

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:15.833
No.

01:49:17.291 --> 01:49:18.958
It's okay to be scared.

01:49:20.416 --> 01:49:21.333
I'm not.

01:49:22.541 --> 01:49:23.666
She won't bite.

01:49:25.416 --> 01:49:26.416
How do you know?

01:49:27.916 --> 01:49:29.791
She's not that kind of snake.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:34.250
Good. Reset.

01:49:35.041 --> 01:49:36.875
Back to one.

01:49:37.375 --> 01:49:39.958
Okay, very still.
Very quiet, please.

01:49:40.041 --> 01:49:42.208
Very quickly, guys. Clearing.

01:49:44.583 --> 01:49:46.666
- And set.
- We are set.

01:49:47.166 --> 01:49:48.458
And action.

01:49:51.416 --> 01:49:52.958
Are you scared?

01:49:53.625 --> 01:49:54.458
No.

01:49:57.625 --> 01:49:59.291
It's okay to be scared.

01:50:00.166 --> 01:50:01.166
I'm not.

01:50:03.833 --> 01:50:05.083
She won't bite.

01:50:06.500 --> 01:50:07.625
How do you know?

01:50:11.333 --> 01:50:13.541
She's not that kind of snake.

01:50:19.041 --> 01:50:20.958
Beautiful. I think we got it.

01:50:21.041 --> 01:50:23.416
Wait, can we... Can we do it again, please?

01:50:23.500 --> 01:50:25.500
- Please? Just for me.
- Lizzie...

01:50:25.583 --> 01:50:27.291
Please. Wait, it's getting more real.

01:50:28.333 --> 01:50:29.541
We're going again.

01:50:29.625 --> 01:50:30.833
Good. Reset.

01:50:31.708 --> 01:50:33.416
Back to one.

01:50:35.500 --> 01:50:37.041
Very quickly, guys.

01:50:41.250 --> 01:50:42.125
Set.

01:50:43.625 --> 01:50:45.625
And action.

01:50:47.875 --> 01:50:49.875
