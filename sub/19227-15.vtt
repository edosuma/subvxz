00:06.431 --> 00:08.676
Okay, 
who broke what?

00:08.850 --> 00:10.936
No,
we're just helping with the laundry.

00:11.068 --> 00:13.361
- Like we do.
- Because we love to.

00:13.438 --> 00:16.806
Oh, man, whatever they broke
is gonna cost at least a grand.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.177
Everything's fine.

00:18.259 --> 00:20.244
But 
if you wanted to say thanks,

00:20.310 --> 00:22.908
you could let us go to the big
concert on the pier next Thursday.

00:23.072 --> 00:24.416
Rocking On Water.

00:24.517 --> 00:27.352
All the biggest bands in Boston, 
one night only.

00:27.462 --> 00:29.740
This is the most exciting thing 
to happen in Marshport

00:29.798 --> 00:31.631
since the Shoe Outlet
opened on Route Two.

00:31.689 --> 00:35.681
Thursday,
as in school night Thursday?

00:36.470 --> 00:38.103
- No.
- No?!

00:38.170 --> 00:40.119
But it's going to be the
most amazing night ev...

00:40.189 --> 00:43.037
Ooh, paisley knee sock.
Give me some love.

00:43.095 --> 00:44.662
I'm sorry,
but I don't like the idea

00:44.720 --> 00:47.142
of you girls on the pier
at night; it's not safe.

00:47.200 --> 00:50.535
There's plenty of dangers you
should be more worried about at home.

Even the playhouse Daphne sleeps
in has been pulled off the market.

01:04.111 --> 01:05.158
- What?
- What?

01:05.277 --> 01:08.128
Yeah, I printed out the recall
notice for you last week.

01:09.621 --> 01:11.839
That roof can collapse at any time.

01:16.937 --> 01:20.105
Everybody step off.
That playhouse is mine.

01:20.163 --> 01:22.237
Not anymore. This roof could fall in.

01:22.378 --> 01:25.136
- Says who?
- Harley. She saw a recall.

01:27.789 --> 01:30.433
Thanks... Harley.

01:31.810 --> 01:34.511
I... feel like you don't
really mean thanks.

01:34.708 --> 01:37.636
But where's Daphne supposed to
sleep? In the middle of the hall?

01:37.808 --> 01:41.019
I sleepwalk. She'll have a fat
lip, and I'll have a broken ankle.

01:41.187 --> 01:44.292
Good point. She'll sleep in the bed
that pulls out from under Rachel's.

01:44.424 --> 01:46.558
The bed below the real bed?

01:46.718 --> 01:48.878
I've said it before.
I don't do trundles.

01:48.987 --> 01:51.797
You've been sleeping in a
dog bed. This is a step up.

01:51.855 --> 01:53.800
At least
the trundle's meant for humans.

01:55.019 --> 01:56.878
Thanks, Georgie.

01:57.761 --> 01:59.662
- Is your heart racing?
- Oh, yeah.

01:59.925 --> 02:02.941
One small problem
with the trundle bed.

02:04.013 --> 02:05.581
A shoe caddy?

02:05.862 --> 02:09.354
I needed sandal space, so
I gave away the mattress.

02:09.541 --> 02:12.722
You literally always say we
should donate what we don't need.

02:12.823 --> 02:15.245
That is literally so generous.

02:15.313 --> 02:17.183
I guess you girls
will have to figure out

02:17.241 --> 02:19.198
who's sleeping
in the shoe caddy.

02:24.213 --> 02:25.526
Thanks, Rachel.

02:25.634 --> 02:27.512
Are the hairs standing
up on the back of your...

02:27.569 --> 02:29.089
Yes.

Great. Now a furious
Daphne's moving into our room.

I'm trying to film
something

03:53.507 --> 03:56.041
to post on my new
E-town McMoney channel.

03:56.847 --> 03:59.605
Hey, Lewie and I are
doing important work, too.

03:59.715 --> 04:02.480
We're looking for garbage so
gross, it'll make you hurl.

04:02.552 --> 04:04.597
Like our TV hero,
Dumpster Jack.

04:04.706 --> 04:06.340
You can't just wear the Jack suit.

04:06.398 --> 04:08.308
You need
to earn the Jack suit.

04:08.387 --> 04:10.715
Hey, can you film us holding
this rotten turkey leg

04:10.840 --> 04:12.246
to put on Dumpster Jack's channel?

04:12.327 --> 04:14.152
We posted there last week,

04:14.273 --> 04:17.418
and 832 people liked it.

04:17.815 --> 04:20.027
832?!

04:20.176 --> 04:22.293
The most I've gotten is like five,

04:22.457 --> 04:24.114
and I come from
a family of nine.

04:24.222 --> 04:27.074
You're obviously not
eating the right garbage.

04:27.262 --> 04:28.824
But you are.

04:29.099 --> 04:30.715
You guys should launch
your own channel.

04:30.773 --> 04:32.738
I'll be the director,
you'll be the stars.

04:32.796 --> 04:34.347
We'll call it Trash Twins.

04:34.426 --> 04:36.246
Our own channel?

04:36.320 --> 04:39.426
And somebody to document
our rise to garbage glory?

04:39.660 --> 04:41.410
- When do we start?
- Now.

04:41.644 --> 04:43.152
Let's hit the bins.

04:43.894 --> 04:46.051
Actually, let me change first.

04:46.271 --> 04:47.793
E-town McMoney's saggy pants

04:47.851 --> 04:50.152
are actually Dad's dress jeans.

05:00.521 --> 05:02.058
Daphne's moving in tonight,

05:02.116 --> 05:04.121
so stash anything you
love in a safe spot.

05:04.275 --> 05:07.105
Like if you were expecting
a tornado or an angry bear.

05:07.199 --> 05:08.910
Hopefully,
she won't sniff this out.

05:09.030 --> 05:11.315
I'm leaving all the cheap
stuff on the dresser as a decoy.

05:11.379 --> 05:13.941
Forget makeup;
Daphne's going to want revenge.

05:13.999 --> 05:15.365
We should probably sleep
in shifts

05:15.423 --> 05:17.715
- so someone can keep an eye on her.
- Oh, totally.

05:17.773 --> 05:19.039
Last time
she was mad at me,

05:19.097 --> 05:20.941
I fell asleep and woke
up with no eyebrows.

05:21.238 --> 05:22.965
Yeah, that wasn't so terrible.

05:23.023 --> 05:24.355
They needed maintenance.

05:25.311 --> 05:27.105
Hey, sisters.

05:28.357 --> 05:30.176
Hit the deck!

05:31.481 --> 05:32.847
I get it.

05:32.991 --> 05:35.959
You thought
I'd be mad. I'm not.

05:36.311 --> 05:37.991
Okay,
what's in the suitcase?

05:38.064 --> 05:40.358
Spiders, rats? Just get it over with.

05:43.521 --> 05:44.928
Hit the deck!

05:47.850 --> 05:49.373
Me and Deathnee realized

05:49.431 --> 05:51.881
it would be fun to be part
of the big girls' room.

05:52.090 --> 05:53.670
Now, can someone please help me get

05:53.741 --> 05:56.339
the dog bed I sleep in?

05:56.459 --> 05:58.803
I like to have head on pillow by 8:00.

06:06.117 --> 06:07.522
She hasn't moved for hours.

06:07.709 --> 06:09.193
She's gotta be dead or asleep.

06:09.303 --> 06:12.209
Either way, she won't
be shaving our eyebrows.

06:12.617 --> 06:14.608
Should we shave hers?
Strike first?

06:14.709 --> 06:15.991
We don't need to.

06:16.119 --> 06:19.139
Turns out the Daphne monster
was mostly in our minds,

06:19.350 --> 06:21.061
which is good,
because I have

06:21.131 --> 06:22.418
the perfect plan on
how to sneak out

06:22.475 --> 06:25.420
for the concert next week.
Here it is.

06:25.701 --> 06:27.354
We wait till everyone goes to sleep,

06:27.412 --> 06:29.072
and then we put on all black.

06:29.279 --> 06:32.670
It's not only stylish;
it's good for sneaking.

06:36.211 --> 06:38.717
Ooh, nice and crispy,
like I like.

06:38.819 --> 06:40.006
Hey, that's mine.

06:40.151 --> 06:41.897
Not anymore.

06:42.383 --> 06:43.397
You can't just...

06:43.455 --> 06:45.555
I can just anything I want...

06:45.787 --> 06:48.889
unless you want me to tell
Mom and Dad a few things.

06:49.030 --> 06:51.428
Things?
What things?

06:51.486 --> 06:53.049
There's a lot of interesting stuff

06:53.107 --> 06:54.434
that goes on in your room
at night

06:54.491 --> 06:56.780
when you're supposed to be sleeping.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.873
<i>Harley's using outside tools inside.</i>

07:02.061 --> 07:05.233
<i>Rachel's making church
clothes into party clothes.</i>

07:05.492 --> 07:07.425
<i>And Georgie's racking up charges</i>

07:07.483 --> 07:10.287
<i>playing fantasy softball
with her pals in England.</i>

07:13.000 --> 07:15.076
You want more bacon?
I'll make you more bacon.

07:15.220 --> 07:16.436
Mm-mm.

07:16.704 --> 07:20.139
You obviously don't know
the code of room sharing,

07:20.326 --> 07:22.404
but what happens
in the sisters' room

07:22.475 --> 07:24.206
stays in the sisters' room.

07:24.264 --> 07:25.495
Yeah, that's over.

07:25.616 --> 07:28.092
Now we all live by another code.

07:28.266 --> 07:31.234
The "do what Daphne wants
or else" code.

07:31.436 --> 07:34.070
Not the best name, but I'm
not looking to impress you.

07:34.194 --> 07:36.975
Daphne, I'm sorry your
playhouse got taken away,

07:37.033 --> 07:38.647
but we didn't do it on purpose.

07:38.772 --> 07:40.858
Why do you have to
go all gangster on us?

07:40.959 --> 07:42.756
I'm the last man in the room,

07:42.892 --> 07:44.131
and the youngest.

07:44.243 --> 07:46.096
I don't want the
sticky drawers,

07:46.217 --> 07:49.569
the broken hangers,
the trundle bed.

07:49.936 --> 07:52.381
I'm used to a certain
standard of living.

07:52.717 --> 07:55.600
Your house was two feet
away from the toilet.

07:56.178 --> 07:57.944
I'm going upstairs to
see which of your beds

07:58.002 --> 08:00.233
Deathnee and I like best.

08:00.451 --> 08:03.733
And now,
I'm starting with yours.

08:05.897 --> 08:08.326
Mom and Dad seem like
such nice people.

08:08.475 --> 08:09.741
How did they produce that?

08:09.811 --> 08:12.889
Guys,
she's trying to rattle us.

08:13.170 --> 08:14.676
We just need to let her settle in,

08:14.772 --> 08:18.084
then she'll back off
and leave us alone. Hmm?

08:59.316 --> 09:00.506
What?

09:04.652 --> 09:07.676
See, here's the basic blueprint
for Daphne's playhouse.

09:08.132 --> 09:10.232
If I simply make a
hinge from here to here,

09:10.348 --> 09:12.590
ta-da, faulty roof problem fixed.

09:12.848 --> 09:15.139
Ta-da! Daphne goes
back to her playhouse.

09:15.175 --> 09:17.973
Ta-da! I stop having
to be a part of things

09:18.031 --> 09:19.383
where we say "ta-da!"

09:19.441 --> 09:21.938
I'm really sorry, girls,
but it's too late.

09:21.996 --> 09:23.416
Your dad already got rid
of the house.

09:23.473 --> 09:25.332
- It's gone.
- Seriously?

09:25.504 --> 09:28.121
It takes him until April to get
rid of the old Christmas tree,

09:28.179 --> 09:30.035
but he does this in a day?

09:30.160 --> 09:31.270
Ta-da!

09:31.435 --> 09:34.236
Sorry,
but it's probably for the best.

09:34.294 --> 09:36.816
It's time Daphne grew up and
stopped sleeping in there.

09:37.051 --> 09:39.848
This is just another
Diaz happy accident.

09:39.965 --> 09:42.133
Once again, life steps in

09:42.168 --> 09:44.684
to make us much better
parents than we are.

09:44.976 --> 09:46.582
Life is our co-parent.

09:47.834 --> 09:50.481
I don't need a third
parent or a fourth roommate.

09:50.684 --> 09:54.059
Sorry, life, Daphne's going
back to that playhouse.

09:55.637 --> 09:58.191
And now,
the Trash Twins bring you

09:58.340 --> 10:00.645
found finger food of the week.

10:01.222 --> 10:02.871
You know pig in a blanket.

10:03.012 --> 10:05.301
Get ready for pickle in a jacket.

10:05.525 --> 10:09.348
This is your basic dill wrapped
in strawberry fruit leather,

10:09.512 --> 10:11.495
but use whatever flavor you have handy.

10:11.652 --> 10:14.232
Have fun with it. How is it, Beast?

10:14.480 --> 10:15.714
Fantastic!

10:15.801 --> 10:17.582
<i>Well, that's our show, folks.</i>

10:17.670 --> 10:21.613
<i>Till next time, Trash Twins are out.</i>

10:25.137 --> 10:28.106
Guys, our channel is blowing up.

10:28.164 --> 10:30.738
I know. We're total
rock stars at school.

10:30.869 --> 10:33.551
A third grader asked me
to sign her banana peel.

10:33.686 --> 10:36.160
And then she asked me to eat it.

10:36.341 --> 10:37.895
- Let's go ride bikes.
- Yeah.

10:38.004 --> 10:39.257
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:39.348 --> 10:40.491
We're hot.

10:40.526 --> 10:42.063
If we wanna keep this
momentum going,

10:42.121 --> 10:43.926
we've gotta create
fresh content.

10:44.051 --> 10:46.598
But Arnie Kaplan's
brother built a bike jump

10:46.699 --> 10:49.367
so awesome, three kids
already broke their arms.

10:49.512 --> 10:53.304
People are waiting to see
what the Trash Twins do next.

10:53.473 --> 10:56.668
Do you want a broken arm,
or 1,000 more followers?

10:59.623 --> 11:01.660
I checked every toy store everywhere.

11:01.816 --> 11:04.340
Unless you're up for a
road trip to Saskatchewan,

11:04.454 --> 11:06.120
Daphne's dollhouse is sold out.

11:06.457 --> 11:09.551
Found it!
Right here in town.

11:10.121 --> 11:11.707
It's at Cush's Toy Store.

11:13.142 --> 11:15.801
Cush's? How far is Saskatchewan?

11:15.965 --> 11:17.215
Why? What's the problem?

11:17.288 --> 11:19.479
Our family may have
a bit of a reputation

11:19.613 --> 11:22.145
with Mr. Cush when it
comes to returning toys.

11:22.754 --> 11:25.238
Hey, it came
out of the box that way.

11:26.324 --> 11:28.473
It didn't say you
couldn't put this in the oven.

11:30.376 --> 11:32.176
Manufacturing error.

11:33.045 --> 11:35.145
Mr. Cush will never
sell it to us

11:35.223 --> 11:36.910
once he sees we're a Diaz.

11:37.014 --> 11:39.723
Lucky for us, there's
one Diaz he doesn't know.

11:39.832 --> 11:41.559
One who is such a people pleaser,

11:41.629 --> 11:44.035
she's never returned
anything in her life.

11:47.465 --> 11:49.410
I'd like to say that's not me,

11:49.468 --> 11:51.941
but I'm too much of a
people pleaser to disagree.

11:53.529 --> 11:57.426
Oh, yeah, really dip that chocolate
doughnut into the clam chowder.

11:57.512 --> 12:00.626
I want to feel the whole
choca-clam doughnut mush.

12:00.684 --> 12:03.449
Dude,
we've been at this for hours!

12:03.535 --> 12:06.285
Even the best garbage doesn't
taste good after a while.

12:06.343 --> 12:08.918
Yeah, and those peanut
butter oysters are starting

12:09.035 --> 12:10.614
to swim their way back up.

12:10.816 --> 12:13.103
Can't do this anymore. We quit.

12:13.186 --> 12:14.879
No, no, no. You can't quit.

12:14.937 --> 12:16.926
Um, hang on. New plan.

12:16.984 --> 12:19.824
What if
you don't actually eat?

12:20.068 --> 12:22.098
What if we use camera tricks

12:22.156 --> 12:24.156
to fool the audience into
thinking you're eating?

12:24.330 --> 12:25.715
Isn't that cheating?

12:25.832 --> 12:27.887
No, it's movie magic.

12:27.957 --> 12:30.215
Do you think they actually
built an amusement park

12:30.273 --> 12:32.217
with cloned dinosaurs?
No.

12:33.503 --> 12:35.637
Do you think they can
by the time we turn 18?

12:35.738 --> 12:37.113
We had a trip planned.

12:37.238 --> 12:39.004
Watch and learn.

12:39.731 --> 12:42.457
<i>This is how you're gonna
fool the general public.</i>

12:49.425 --> 12:51.091
Awesome.

12:53.626 --> 12:56.918
Nice. Good job.
Good job.

12:57.256 --> 12:59.887
Okay, just go up and
ask for the playhouse.

13:00.043 --> 13:01.399
Don't mention
any of our names.

13:01.465 --> 13:04.332
Especially Diaz.
Don't even say the letter "D."

13:04.574 --> 13:06.543
I got this. I'm good.

13:06.738 --> 13:09.462
I'm not, but the people pleaser
me doesn't want you to know.

13:09.520 --> 13:13.215
Then the people pleaser needs
to please me and stop talking.

13:14.746 --> 13:17.191
Hi. I'm... nobody.

13:17.746 --> 13:19.660
Do you have the Teeny
Tots Country Cottage?

13:19.746 --> 13:21.602
Oh, that's a hot item.

13:21.660 --> 13:22.676
We've only got one left.

13:22.801 --> 13:24.856
Oh, it's my lucky Diaz.

13:25.121 --> 13:26.348
I mean day.

13:26.459 --> 13:29.051
Sorry. I'm so excited,
I can Harley stand it.

13:29.205 --> 13:30.356
I mean hardly.

13:30.496 --> 13:32.759
Just give me the playhouse,
and I'll Beast outta your hair.

13:32.816 --> 13:34.832
Be out of your hair.

13:35.996 --> 13:38.004
Okay,
you got me, Mr. Cush.

13:38.379 --> 13:40.949
I'm Georgie Diaz
from the Diaz family.

13:41.066 --> 13:43.254
I'm Duncan Gloverman
from the temp agency.

13:43.419 --> 13:44.918
Mr. Cush went to lunch.

13:46.129 --> 13:48.629
In that case,
can I get the house?

13:48.785 --> 13:50.566
Quickly.
I don't want to bother Mr. Cush

13:50.624 --> 13:52.801
while he's Ethan.
I mean eating.

13:56.107 --> 13:57.306
Here it is.

13:57.623 --> 14:00.074
You look at this and see
a little plastic house.

14:00.669 --> 14:02.395
I look at this and see...

14:04.707 --> 14:07.371
A miracle! Adios, Daphne.

14:07.429 --> 14:08.949
Here we come!

14:09.007 --> 14:11.574
Your brand-new, really
hard to get up the stairs

14:11.652 --> 14:13.074
playhouse!

14:13.221 --> 14:15.113
I just need to hang up the curtains,

14:15.191 --> 14:17.262
but it's exactly the
same as your old one.

14:17.510 --> 14:19.965
Minus the roof that can
flatten you like a pancake.

14:21.660 --> 14:23.314
I don't like it.

14:27.441 --> 14:30.287
Just to be clear, I am not
going back to return this.

14:31.927 --> 14:33.246
Hey, Daphne,

14:33.371 --> 14:35.676
you're missing out
on a pretty great tea party.

14:35.801 --> 14:38.371
All the headless dolls
keep asking where you are.

14:40.274 --> 14:42.356
This is so fun.

14:42.488 --> 14:43.934
I'd live here if I could.

14:44.028 --> 14:47.020
You should. It would give
us more space in the room.

14:47.149 --> 14:49.040
Is it the dolls?
I know they're creepy,

14:49.098 --> 14:51.000
but in our defense,
those are yours.

14:51.035 --> 14:53.703
They are;
the house isn't.

14:54.090 --> 14:55.793
It's exactly the same.

14:55.880 --> 14:57.527
No, it's not.

14:57.797 --> 15:00.254
Where's the dent from the
pumpkin Lewie threw at Beast?

15:00.312 --> 15:02.926
Or the chip where Ethan
lost a tooth?

15:03.556 --> 15:06.524
Or the hole from the time
Georgie tried to roller skate?

15:06.832 --> 15:08.566
That's what our family does to stuff.

15:08.699 --> 15:10.020
We wreck it.

15:10.186 --> 15:12.957
Those are Diaz defects.
This one's perfect.

15:13.973 --> 15:15.394
Not to me.

15:17.145 --> 15:18.371
Hang on.

15:18.536 --> 15:20.346
The defects are what she likes?

15:21.035 --> 15:22.268
Why?

15:22.371 --> 15:24.824
I guess the holes,
the dents, the dings,

15:25.145 --> 15:26.785
those are her memories.

15:27.071 --> 15:30.613
I had no idea Daphne had
such sentimental feelings.

15:31.027 --> 15:32.378
Or feelings.

15:32.715 --> 15:34.504
There goes my evil robot theory.

15:35.155 --> 15:36.887
I did a terrible thing.

15:37.121 --> 15:39.957
Because of me,
Dad got rid of Daphne's playhouse.

15:40.332 --> 15:42.454
I had no idea
she was so attached to it.

15:42.566 --> 15:44.074
Here, eat this.

15:45.059 --> 15:46.918
I already said
I did a terrible thing.

15:47.098 --> 15:48.309
You don't need to poison me.

15:48.439 --> 15:50.082
No, it's fine.

15:50.338 --> 15:51.738
Thanks to a little food coloring,

15:51.796 --> 15:53.887
I've recreated the perfect moldy green.

15:54.149 --> 15:56.676
Luckily, we have a lot
of examples in our fridge.

15:56.918 --> 15:58.106
Cool, huh?

15:58.410 --> 15:59.527
Hello?!

15:59.640 --> 16:01.340
BFTF, feeling sad here.

16:01.613 --> 16:02.738
Where's the love?

16:02.949 --> 16:04.443
I don't know where the love is,

16:04.478 --> 16:06.254
but the playhouse is
sitting in the dumpster

16:06.312 --> 16:07.949
in an alley behind the
Sheltons' house.

16:08.007 --> 16:09.129
What?!

16:09.187 --> 16:11.145
Yeah, I saw it when
I was scouting locations.

16:11.248 --> 16:13.641
You think Dad's gonna go
all the way to the dump

16:13.699 --> 16:15.426
when he can
unload it a block away?

16:15.645 --> 16:16.941
Yes!

16:17.139 --> 16:20.988
Okay, let me talk you through the
"garbage food" you're gonna eat.

16:21.090 --> 16:25.285
Today's menu features a
moldy bologna sandwich,

16:25.465 --> 16:27.129
but don't worry.

16:27.187 --> 16:28.902
The green is just kale juice.

16:28.995 --> 16:31.129
Still gross, but you'll
be able to keep it down.

16:31.188 --> 16:35.059
Boy, fooling the general public
is a lot easier than it seems.

16:35.181 --> 16:37.691
Yeah, that general
public is pretty dumb.

16:37.770 --> 16:39.840
Where are my Trash Twins at?

16:39.898 --> 16:41.746
That sounds like...

16:42.404 --> 16:44.337
Dumpster Jack!!

16:44.452 --> 16:46.485
Hey, little Jacks.

16:46.559 --> 16:48.684
A bunch of fans turned
me on to your channel.

16:48.755 --> 16:51.285
I was in the area and
figured we could do dunch.

16:51.434 --> 16:54.762
That's dumpster lunch
for the insiders.

16:56.697 --> 16:58.688
Would you believe that we already

16:58.746 --> 17:00.973
filled up on "dreakfast"?

17:01.313 --> 17:03.280
Yeah, that's not a word.

17:06.782 --> 17:08.691
Don't the Sheltons raise chickens?

17:11.699 --> 17:13.105
I really hope so.

17:13.232 --> 17:15.265
The alternative is
too scary to consider.

17:15.377 --> 17:17.977
Sorry, but I'm gonna say
no to getting in that thing.

17:18.035 --> 17:20.167
I don't have whole outfits
I can just throw away

17:20.226 --> 17:21.675
like you guys.

17:23.723 --> 17:25.184
You can stand there clean,

17:25.242 --> 17:27.953
or get in here, get
Daphne's playhouse back,

17:28.011 --> 17:31.238
and maybe go to the Rocking On
Water concert tomorrow night.

17:32.666 --> 17:35.800
Fine.
But if you tell anyone this story,

17:35.858 --> 17:37.395
change my name.

17:38.056 --> 17:40.348
Dumpster Jack and the Trash Twins.

17:40.508 --> 17:41.785
Gonna be epic.

17:41.843 --> 17:44.895
Now, who's ready to make
a dumpster cry uncle?

17:45.434 --> 17:47.579
We are.

17:47.763 --> 17:49.332
Who needs a dumpster?

17:49.390 --> 17:52.723
We got some spontaneous
garbage right here.

17:52.832 --> 17:55.746
Look.
Really authentic fridge mold.

17:55.879 --> 17:57.246
Mmm... eww!

17:57.304 --> 17:59.215
Look at that green.

18:00.411 --> 18:02.378
Hey, guest gets first bite.

18:02.663 --> 18:04.301
Appreciate the hospitality,

18:04.359 --> 18:06.758
but I drove by a dumpster
on my way here

18:06.816 --> 18:08.402
that I could smell from
Ducksberg.

18:08.460 --> 18:09.879
Let's shoot there.

18:16.536 --> 18:17.973
Last piece!

18:20.871 --> 18:23.152
It's gonna be a while before
I can eat chicken again.

18:23.645 --> 18:25.105
Or anything.

18:25.270 --> 18:26.287
Hey!

18:26.353 --> 18:28.579
There's my roller skate
dent.

18:28.637 --> 18:31.168
It does bring back
memories.

18:32.785 --> 18:34.277
Oh, man.

18:34.368 --> 18:36.334
Someone beat us to our dumpster.

18:36.393 --> 18:38.426
- That's our sisters.
- Nice.

18:38.509 --> 18:41.090
The family that dives
together thrives together.

18:41.218 --> 18:42.746
Dumpster's all yours, boys.

18:42.855 --> 18:44.066
We gotta get this thing home.

18:44.278 --> 18:45.996
Taking your meal to go.

18:46.138 --> 18:47.668
Very smart.

18:51.293 --> 18:54.137
If you're trying to lead me into
the woods and leave me there,

18:54.195 --> 18:56.529
you should know,
I'm like a bloodhound.

18:56.646 --> 18:59.215
I'll find my way back
and end your world.

18:59.637 --> 19:02.762
Which is one of the reasons we
don't want you in our room anymore.

19:04.707 --> 19:05.965
It's your old house.

19:06.090 --> 19:07.551
I reinforced it, so it's safe.

19:07.695 --> 19:10.957
See? It has a flip-top roof.

19:12.078 --> 19:14.066
We know you love it.

19:15.016 --> 19:16.916
In case you get teary.

19:17.949 --> 19:19.371
Thanks.

19:22.376 --> 19:24.777
"Thanks"? That's it?

19:25.004 --> 19:27.184
I'm covered in cock-a-doodle doo-doo.

19:27.246 --> 19:29.637
You three are the
reason I lost my house.

19:29.730 --> 19:30.895
Now it's back.

19:30.960 --> 19:32.793
What do you expect, a parade?

19:34.801 --> 19:39.004
Okay, not the warm,
fuzzy moment I expected,

19:39.715 --> 19:41.238
but we have our room back.

19:42.543 --> 19:45.426
I can still smell you. Move along.

19:49.637 --> 19:51.715
We're going to have to eat real trash.

19:51.908 --> 19:53.965
This wasn't the plan, Ethan.

19:54.707 --> 19:56.608
Guys.

19:57.051 --> 19:58.477
It's hard-boiled.

19:58.613 --> 20:00.098
I can't say how long ago,

20:00.156 --> 20:03.340
but that's what makes
great TV. Start rolling.

20:04.878 --> 20:07.871
Beast is typically more of
the egg man in this operation.

20:08.399 --> 20:11.996
Yeah, I've been meaning
to let you in on that fun.

20:12.418 --> 20:13.676
Go for it.

20:13.764 --> 20:15.441
If I hadn't seen all your videos,

20:15.499 --> 20:18.324
I'd think that you guys
didn't want to eat that egg.

20:23.504 --> 20:25.304
Nooooo!

20:27.830 --> 20:29.162
Look at you.

20:29.541 --> 20:32.075
This family just gets
better and better.

20:32.220 --> 20:34.496
Stand back.
I'm a-divin'.

20:35.574 --> 20:37.902
Did you use a camera trick to eat that?

20:38.066 --> 20:40.418
Because you really look
like you're about to barf.

20:40.521 --> 20:41.996
Oh, I am,

20:42.115 --> 20:44.340
but I got you guys into this mess.

20:44.441 --> 20:47.141
I couldn't watch you look
bad in front of Dumpster Jack.

20:47.716 --> 20:48.815
He's your hero.

20:50.027 --> 20:51.918
He's not our only hero.

20:52.934 --> 20:56.051
Aww. Getting teary.

20:57.462 --> 20:59.715
Then again, that may be
the kickback from the egg.

20:59.816 --> 21:02.730
Bonus! Old Chinese food.

21:02.879 --> 21:05.707
And this place was closed
for health violations.

21:05.934 --> 21:07.100
Who's in?

21:10.313 --> 21:12.246
Tell Mom and Dad I love them.

21:13.986 --> 21:15.518
Ethan, no.

21:17.179 --> 21:19.121
The truth is, Dumpster Jack,

21:19.637 --> 21:22.027
our taste for garbage
died many days ago.

21:22.098 --> 21:23.223
We're frauds.

21:23.321 --> 21:25.535
We don't deserve
o wear these overalls.

21:28.832 --> 21:31.746
Go easy on yourselves, little dudes.

21:32.134 --> 21:34.621
This skill takes years to master.

21:34.762 --> 21:37.863
When I was your age, I could
barely eat food off the floor.

21:39.020 --> 21:41.512
I can eat off the floor in my sleep!

21:41.637 --> 21:43.074
In fact, I have.

21:43.132 --> 21:45.051
You keep at it,
and in no time,

21:45.109 --> 21:46.543
you'll be able to do this.

21:51.243 --> 21:52.442
Yeah.

21:52.563 --> 21:54.530
I can see why this place was shut down.

22:02.738 --> 22:04.301
Looks like
someone's sneaking out

22:04.359 --> 22:06.727
to go to the Rocking On
Water concert.

22:06.785 --> 22:08.407
Just because you sleep
in a dog bed

22:08.442 --> 22:09.574
doesn't mean
you're a guard dog.

22:09.631 --> 22:10.941
Tom, you coming up?

22:12.403 --> 22:14.566
It's Mom and Dad.
Back in the room.

22:15.941 --> 22:17.311
- I locked it.
- What?!

22:17.369 --> 22:19.368
I didn't want Daphne to
get in while we were gone.

22:19.426 --> 22:22.574
- Where's the key?
- In my purse, on the bed.

22:22.706 --> 22:24.475
What are we going to do?

22:27.772 --> 22:28.938
I got an idea.

22:33.520 --> 22:35.749
Daphne, what are you still doing up?

22:35.882 --> 22:39.132
Just enjoying my house.
Pride of ownership.

22:39.339 --> 22:40.975
Don't stay up too late, beautiful.

22:43.241 --> 22:44.374
Sweet dreams.

22:44.882 --> 22:46.745
Thank you. Good night.

22:51.529 --> 22:53.507
Coast is clear.

22:55.410 --> 22:58.280
Thanks, Daphne. Bless
your little metal heart.

22:58.718 --> 23:00.593
Hey,
you're the one who got me

23:00.661 --> 23:01.819
this flip-top house.

23:01.903 --> 23:04.036
Besides,
you know the code.

23:04.291 --> 23:06.024
What happens in the sisters' room

23:06.082 --> 23:07.757
stays in the sisters' room.

23:07.919 --> 23:10.296
Even if your sister
lives in the hallway.

23:10.655 --> 23:12.694
<i>Daphne may march to her own drummer,</i>

23:12.888 --> 23:15.796
<i>or sometimes just hit
you with the drum sticks,</i>

23:15.936 --> 23:17.194
<i>but at the end of the day,</i>

23:17.302 --> 23:20.169
<i>she's definitely part
of the sister team.</i>
