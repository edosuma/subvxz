WEBVTT

00:02.300 --> 00:05.292
- Come on, ref!
- Hey! 32!

00:08.370 --> 00:10.668
!
Open your eyes!

00:10.710 --> 00:13.304
- Come on, Corey!

00:13.340 --> 00:15.729
- Go, go, go! Go Corey!

00:15.780 --> 00:19.272
***

00:19.320 --> 00:21.413
Yeah!

00:21.450 --> 00:23.748
That's my boy!

00:23.790 --> 00:26.418
Well, that's your boy.
- Yeah, Corey! Woo!

00:26.460 --> 00:28.348
- Playing like that, he'll be
picked in the first round.

00:31.330 --> 00:35.096
: I'll be right back.
- Yeah. Woo! Corey!

00:35.130 --> 00:38.622
- Hey, Corey.
You're doing great.

00:38.670 --> 00:41.662
- Feels like I'm fighting off
the other players more
than I'm scoring.

00:41.700 --> 00:43.668
- Two goals halfway through the
first period. Keep fighting.

00:43.710 --> 00:46.577
- Look at this.
Tape on the skate.

00:46.610 --> 00:48.669
- They're pranking you 'cause
they're scared. Don't sweat it.

00:48.710 --> 00:51.645
- Ice dance tr_ials _
are next door, Sinclair.

00:51.680 --> 00:53.477
- So what are you
doing here, Sam?

00:53.520 --> 00:56.842
Better hurry. You might miss
your big shot. You too, Brendan.

00:56.890 --> 00:59.450
Enjoy this moment, Corey.

01:01.790 --> 01:03.428
You know how long I've been
waiting for this? You remember

01:03.460 --> 01:06.827
when I first spotted you,
11 years old, second-hand
skates. What did I tell you?

01:06.860 --> 01:09.420
- You told me I was going
to be a superstar.

01:09.470 --> 01:11.859
- Damn straight. This is your
time, kid. Straight to the top.

01:11.900 --> 01:13.765
Now wave to your mommy
and the head of the league

01:13.800 --> 01:16.337
and get back out there.
: Watch the offside!

01:16.370 --> 01:19.305
- Game can change
in an instant, Shade.

01:19.340 --> 01:22.241
- Yeah, I know. That's what
you and your six percenter
Brendan are counting on.

01:22.280 --> 01:25.704
- That and you screwing up.
- Is screwing up the right
terminology?

01:25.750 --> 01:28.344
- With you it was
always screwing down.

01:28.380 --> 01:31.281
- Ouch.
- Don't look so cocky.

01:31.320 --> 01:33.459
Your kid's gonna turn pro,

01:33.490 --> 01:36.288
but he'll be luclq to have
a cup of coffee in the IPHL.

01:36.330 --> 01:38.548
- That why you tried to swoop in
like you scouted him yourself?

01:38.590 --> 01:41.320
- You're hardly a scout anymore.
- Freelance, Jamie.

01:41.360 --> 01:43.328
It's the new economy.
- Then why are you

01:43.370 --> 01:45.395
hustling so hard to get
back to pro scouting?

01:45.430 --> 01:47.694
- So we can hold hands the way
we used to when we rode

01:47.740 --> 01:51.267
the bench together, Bob.
- Did you ever track down

01:51.310 --> 01:53.403
that manager who cleaned you up?
Because I feel for you, man.

01:53.440 --> 01:56.648
Really do.

01:56.680 --> 01:58.841
- Excuse me, kiddies.

01:58.880 --> 02:01.110
Someone who matters
wants to talk to me.

02:07.460 --> 02:10.281
- Seems like you still know
talent when you see it, Shade.

02:10.330 --> 02:12.298
- Sounds like a door opening.

02:12.330 --> 02:14.548
- I like what I see.
Let's talk after the game.

02:14.600 --> 02:16.659
About Corey's future
with the Intercontinental

02:16.700 --> 02:19.692
Pro Hockey League... and yours.

02:19.740 --> 02:22.607
- Thanks, Patrick. Seriously.

02:22.640 --> 02:24.403
: Come on, Corey!
- Go Corey!

02:24.440 --> 02:27.876
Go Corey!
- You've got it, Corey! Yeah!

02:27.910 --> 02:29.878
That's it! Go, go, go!

02:29.910 --> 02:32.378
- Yeah!

02:32.420 --> 02:34.638
- Woo!
- That's how we do it!

02:34.680 --> 02:38.480
Yeah! Yeah, attaboy!

02:38.520 --> 02:41.353
Alright!
- Corey, attaboy!

02:57.940 --> 03:01.501
: Get down there!

03:01.540 --> 03:04.475
What happened?

03:04.510 --> 03:07.741
- One, two, three.
Kid's heart is stopped.

03:07.780 --> 03:10.419
Corey.
Corey, look at me.

03:10.450 --> 03:12.486
Corey? Come on!
- Back, sir.

03:12.520 --> 03:14.909
!
- Ma'am, please step back.

03:19.430 --> 03:22.319
- Do not touch patient.
Analyzing heart rhythm.

03:24.370 --> 03:27.362
- Start CPR.

03:27.400 --> 03:30.506
Press, press, press, press,
press, press, press,

03:30.540 --> 03:33.577
press, press, press,
press, press...

03:36.480 --> 03:39.449
- ** I see you and you see me

03:39.480 --> 03:43.587
* Watch you blowin' the lines
when you're making a scene *

03:43.620 --> 03:46.987
* Oh boy, you've got to know

03:47.020 --> 03:49.329
* What my head overlooks

03:49.360 --> 03:52.796
* The senses will show
to my heart *

03:52.830 --> 03:55.594
* When it's watching for lies

03:55.630 --> 03:57.928
* 'Cause you can't escape my

03:57.970 --> 03:59.597
* Private Eyes

03:59.640 --> 04:02.302
* They're watching you

04:02.340 --> 04:04.729
* Private Eyes

04:04.770 --> 04:06.772
* They're watching you,
watching you, watching you *

04:06.810 --> 04:09.233
* Watching you *

04:17.090 --> 04:18.944
- He's medicated and intubated,
and we're placing him

04:18.990 --> 04:20.958
on a hypothermic
cooling protocol.

04:20.990 --> 04:22.924
- It keeps him cool, Linda,
while his body gets a rest,

04:22.960 --> 04:24.928
it's not unusual--

04:24.960 --> 04:26.598
- Similar. He'll be kept
unconscious and paralyzed,

04:26.630 --> 04:28.951
on a breathing tube. A
myocardial infarction

04:29.000 --> 04:31.662
is unusual in a kid his age;
we'll run a full tox screen

04:31.700 --> 04:33.861
including a test for PEDs,

04:33.900 --> 04:37.700
anabolic steroids--
- Not necessary. Cory doesn't
use performance enhancing drugs.

04:37.740 --> 04:41.301
I know my son.
- Our kids don't always tell us

04:41.340 --> 04:43.479
everything they're doing.
We need to be thorough.

04:43.510 --> 04:45.808
I'll let you know
the results.

04:48.580 --> 04:51.947
- He's strong, Linda.
He'll get through this.

04:51.990 --> 04:54.083
- I know.

04:54.120 --> 04:56.327
You're right.

04:58.130 --> 05:00.428
Shade, you're gonna be late.
You should get going.

05:03.030 --> 05:05.464
- Oh, my God.
- Go.

05:05.500 --> 05:08.833
It's OK.
- I'll call you.

05:08.870 --> 05:10.838
Don't worry.

05:10.870 --> 05:12.929
I will find out
what happened, I promise you.

05:12.980 --> 05:16.507
- OK.

05:32.530 --> 05:36.091
- Hey! Sorry I'm late, sorry.

05:36.130 --> 05:37.927
Um, I'm Matt Shade.

05:37.970 --> 05:39.858
- Ann Frame. We're glad
you could make it,

05:39.900 --> 05:41.492
Mr. Shade, given
the short notice.

05:41.540 --> 05:45.636
- Jules's mom would have been
here but she's out of town.
Out of the country.

05:45.670 --> 05:48.798
- Yeah, we covered that.
- OK.

05:48.840 --> 05:50.944
Sitting down.

05:50.980 --> 05:53.073
- So, as you know, we've had
a couple of spots open up.

05:53.120 --> 05:55.418
Ellard has a long
waiting list,

05:55.450 --> 05:59.454
obviously, but Juliet's marks
are outstanding.

05:59.490 --> 06:02.379
Straight A's.
- Actually, I have
an incomplete in Gym

06:02.430 --> 06:04.159
and a B in Geography. My dad

06:04.190 --> 06:06.556
used to play pro hockey.
There were a lot of concussions.

06:06.600 --> 06:09.489
- Ah.

06:09.530 --> 06:12.795
- Look, Principal Frame, it's my
dream to be a student at Ellard,

06:12.840 --> 06:15.161
but_if this is about
meetIng some sort of

06:15.200 --> 06:18.658
handicapped quota, then I'm not
your girl, I'm really not.

06:18.710 --> 06:21.702
- Trust me, Juliet,
that's not why you're here.

06:21.740 --> 06:24.538
But as we're on the subject...

06:24.580 --> 06:27.469
- It's called macular dystrophy.
- I got it when I was five.

06:27.520 --> 06:29.488
I'm considered legally blind

06:29.520 --> 06:31.988
but I can discern shapes
and avoid most accidents.

06:32.020 --> 06:34.887
- She's more graceful
than I am, that's for sure.

06:34.920 --> 06:37.980
- Perfect. Maybe we can
take a tour while we talk?

06:38.030 --> 06:41.397
- Great, that'll give you
a chance to see how
Jules gets around.

06:46.840 --> 06:49.502
- So lame.

06:50.710 --> 06:53.099
- Sonar.

06:54.740 --> 06:57.846
- Thanks for the update, Linda.

06:57.880 --> 07:00.610
Any changes,
you call me, alright?

07:02.720 --> 07:04.642
- Assuming she gets in,

07:04.690 --> 07:06.419
how are you planning
to pay for all this?
- I'll figure it out.

07:06.460 --> 07:10.578
- Yeah, well, let me know
when that third mortgage gets
approved. Or maybe that's why

07:10.630 --> 07:12.598
you were late?

07:12.630 --> 07:15.155
- Something came up.
- Hm.

07:15.200 --> 07:17.862
- Cory's in
the hospital, Dad.

07:17.900 --> 07:20.198
He had a heart attack
on the ice.

07:20.240 --> 07:23.232
What happened?
- The doctors found PEDs. He had

07:23.270 --> 07:25.909
some kind of weird reaction.
- No, no. He's not a kid
who would do that.

07:25.940 --> 07:28.477
- I know.

07:28.510 --> 07:30.478
- Don't tell her
about this right now.

07:30.510 --> 07:33.547
You know how she idolizes Cory.
- Yeah.

07:33.580 --> 07:35.969
Jules, you did great--

07:42.060 --> 07:44.984
Jules, come on, I'm sorry.
- First you show up late,

07:45.030 --> 07:47.191
and then you get my grades
wrong. Nice one, Dad.

07:47.230 --> 07:49.221
- I dropped
the thread, OK?

07:49.260 --> 07:52.889
But that Principal of yours,
she's one intoxicating woman--
- You know,

07:52.940 --> 07:55.135
today might not be a big deal
for you, but for me?

07:55.170 --> 07:57.138
It was the most important
day of my life.

07:57.170 --> 08:00.628
Grandpa, let's go home.
- I'll be right there.

08:00.680 --> 08:02.875
You should take her.

08:02.910 --> 08:05.208
- I know I should, Dad, but...

08:05.250 --> 08:08.640
You didn't see him,
lying there on the ice.

08:08.680 --> 08:11.148
When Cory wakes up, I wanna make
sure he's still got a future.

08:11.190 --> 08:14.557
If the IPHL thinks he's using
PEDs, he's done, for life.

08:14.590 --> 08:16.558
- Other people can
take care of that.

08:16.590 --> 08:18.956
You need to
take care of her now.

08:18.990 --> 08:21.857
If Cory gets bounced,
I'm never gonna be able
to pay for all this.

08:21.900 --> 08:24.619
- Alright, I know a guy.
Let me make a call.

08:24.670 --> 08:27.161
Used to be a cop, and now
he runs a PI firm.
- Dad,

08:27.200 --> 08:30.169
I know hockey. I know every
dirty little thing about it.

08:30.210 --> 08:32.235
What do I need a PI for?

08:32.270 --> 08:34.738
I'll see you later.

08:42.220 --> 08:44.848
Hey, Jamie, you know where
I can find Sam, or Brendan?

08:44.890 --> 08:47.950
- Not following...
- I was fired.

08:47.990 --> 08:50.185
I've repped Brendan since
he was 15, and now I'm dumped

08:50.230 --> 08:53.222
just as he's about to go pro.
I came here to plead my case,

08:53.260 --> 08:55.251
Brendan won't even see me.
I do not get treated

08:55.300 --> 08:58.189
like this. How's Cory?
- He's not good.

08:58.230 --> 09:00.790
Strange timing,
you getting fired.

09:00.840 --> 09:04.059
- Screw them. There's always
another player. I hope
your kid comes out of this.

09:04.110 --> 09:05.862
- Yeah, thanks. So you know
where I can find them?

09:05.910 --> 09:07.730
- Well, they're confused
about what happened, so...

09:07.780 --> 09:10.044
- So they're at the gym. Got it.
- Yep.

09:17.920 --> 09:20.753
- Look at you guys.

09:20.790 --> 09:23.623
Thought you had it all
locked up, didn't ya?

09:23.660 --> 09:26.322
But then on day one
it became clear that Cory

09:26.360 --> 09:30.069
was gonna get one of the
contracts the rest of you
were counting on.

09:30.100 --> 09:32.591
Changed everything, didn't it?

09:32.640 --> 09:35.689
Lot of stick work
today, Brendan.

09:35.740 --> 09:38.959
Cory's at the hospital hooked up
to a half dozen machines,

09:39.010 --> 09:41.228
and none of you
know what happened?

09:46.180 --> 09:50.184
- Eyes up, kid. Are all
the players as tough as you?

09:50.220 --> 09:53.348
- I can take 'em all,
no problem.

09:53.390 --> 09:56.018
- What about that kid that went
down today

09:56.060 --> 09:58.324
'Cause I think
I would have noticed you.

09:58.360 --> 10:01.989
- Forget it, Sam,
she's outta your league.
- Keep focused. Combination.

10:03.100 --> 10:05.625
- What other combinations
did you throw in, Sam?

10:05.670 --> 10:09.265
I saw that tape on Cory's
skates, was that your work too?
- Easy, tiger.

10:09.300 --> 10:11.268
I'm working
with Sam right now.

10:11.310 --> 10:14.370
If you're looking for a trainer
or some information,
we can talk later.

10:14.410 --> 10:17.072
- Yeah, I would like that,
but right now I want
Sam's attention.

10:17.110 --> 10:19.647
You saw Cory coming for your
sure-fire spot and you decided

10:19.680 --> 10:22.171
to do something
about it, didn't ya?
- I'm clean, man. Back off.

10:22.220 --> 10:25.747
- Who said anything about
you not being clean? Whoa!

10:25.790 --> 10:28.156
Testy.
- Fellas, when a fight
breaks out, I like to be

10:28.190 --> 10:31.182
at the centre of it,
or else my feelings get hurt.

10:31.230 --> 10:33.323
Let's talk later.
Your glutes need work.

10:33.360 --> 10:36.966
- My glutes are fine.
My glutes are Iberico hams.
What d'you do, Sam?

10:37.000 --> 10:39.889
Put something in Cory's
water bottle? Something
that didn't belong?

10:39.940 --> 10:42.431
- You're a loser, Shade,
everyone says so.

10:42.470 --> 10:45.769
You're running around
like you still got a career
when all you've got is one kid

10:45.810 --> 10:49.075
who was stupid enough to think
that you could help him.

10:51.480 --> 10:53.869
- You don't hit kids.

10:53.920 --> 10:55.945
Especially kids
I'm trying to talk to.

10:55.980 --> 10:58.414
- Yo, guys, check this out!

10:58.450 --> 11:01.112
Matt Shade couldn't even
throw a punch past a girl.

11:01.160 --> 11:04.288
You let a girl stop you, dude!
A girl! He let a--

11:04.330 --> 11:07.254
A girl?

11:07.300 --> 11:09.222
- I thought you didn't hit kids.
- I barely touched him.

11:09.260 --> 11:12.696
- You're crazy. The both of you!

11:12.740 --> 11:14.867
- I think
you've done enough.

11:16.910 --> 11:20.038
- I'm Angie Everett.
The PI your dad hired.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.246
How does my dad even know you?

11:32.290 --> 11:35.054
- Apparently your dad and my dad
crossed paths, back in the day.

11:35.090 --> 11:38.253
- Not that I'm complaining,
but how come I got
the junior detective?

11:38.290 --> 11:41.350
- I took over the agency last
year, so technically,
you got the boss.

11:42.930 --> 11:45.490
- I gotta say, that trainer
disguise of yours is a winner.

11:45.530 --> 11:48.465
- I gotta say, you hockey
players are predictable.
At any age.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.468
- Wow, this place is huge.
You rent it out

11:50.510 --> 11:53.070
as a roller rink
on the weekends?
- Interpretive dance.

11:55.440 --> 11:59.376
- You ever think about keeping
your opinions to yourself?

12:00.380 --> 12:03.486
Put your hands out.

12:06.390 --> 12:10.781
- Predictable again.
- You know, I had that kid
in the palm of my hand

12:10.830 --> 12:13.253
until you showed up.

12:13.300 --> 12:16.519
You know what I noticed
about Sam? Remember
when he said "I'm clean?"

12:16.560 --> 12:19.063
I hadn't even mentioned drugs.
It was pretty much a confession.

12:19.100 --> 12:21.466
- I wouldn't jump to
conclusions, but that's because

12:21.500 --> 12:23.161
I'm a professional investigator,
we look before we leap.

12:23.210 --> 12:26.202
I read up on PEDs; there's
three ways to take them--

12:26.240 --> 12:27.901
- Yeah, ingestion,
absorption, injection.

12:27.940 --> 12:31.944
Cory would have told me if he'd
been "accidentally" stuck with
a needle, so that means

12:31.980 --> 12:34.369
somebody must have--
What about
Cory himself?

12:34.420 --> 12:37.048
Dark horse. He gets nervous,
looking for a little boost.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.513
- No. Not him. No way.
- And you know that
for sure because...?

12:39.550 --> 12:42.781
- Because I asked him to once.

12:42.830 --> 12:45.321
He was injured, he was
gonna be out for 20 games,

12:45.360 --> 12:47.897
and I told him he should take
something. He wouldn't do it.

12:47.930 --> 12:50.091
- Hm. You're one of those.

12:50.130 --> 12:52.269
Shortcut guys. Good to know.

12:53.370 --> 12:56.362
- Shortcut guys
don't play pro hockey.
- Which you don't anymore.

12:56.400 --> 12:59.005
Maybe you were always
a shortcut guy and you just
didn't know you were.

12:59.040 --> 13:02.407
- Look. The players all know
there's a scheduled drug test

13:02.440 --> 13:05.841
at the end of the camp.
You test positive, it's
a guaranteed pink slip.

13:05.880 --> 13:07.871
- I'll look into it
and see what I can find out.

13:07.920 --> 13:10.241
Whenever I need the inside scoop
on hockey, I'll be in touch.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.246
- It's Shade money
that's paying you,

13:12.290 --> 13:15.088
so you'll see this inside
scoop tomorrow morning.

13:17.260 --> 13:20.127
"So you'll see this inside scoop
tomorrow morning."

13:20.160 --> 13:23.493
"So you'll see this
inside scoop tomorrow morning."

13:23.530 --> 13:26.294
Idiot.

13:29.600 --> 13:33.377
- I'm trying to remember
who thought the internet
was a good idea.

13:33.410 --> 13:35.207
- You should have told me
what happened to Cory!
He's my friend!

13:35.240 --> 13:38.175
- Honey, I was gonna
tell you tonight

13:38.210 --> 13:40.212
when I had
all the details.

13:40.250 --> 13:43.287
I didn't want it to ruin
your Ellard moment.
You deserved that.

13:43.320 --> 13:45.208
- Just tell me what happened.

13:47.260 --> 13:50.081
- The doctors think he took
PEDs, and his heart went into--

13:50.130 --> 13:52.257
- No way. No. Cory--

13:55.600 --> 13:58.899
- Jules, if you know something,
you should deal us in.

13:58.930 --> 14:02.297
- He told me he had
an aortic aneurysm

14:02.340 --> 14:05.969
when he was a kid, so he could
never take PEDs. Ever.

14:06.010 --> 14:08.399
- Anybody else
know about this?

14:08.440 --> 14:10.408
- His mom. But he said

14:10.450 --> 14:13.510
I was the only other
person he'd told.

14:30.430 --> 14:32.523
- I can see when
your career ended.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.507
If whoever did this

14:42.540 --> 14:46.271
knew about Cory's aneurysm,
that's not rigging a drug test,
that's attempted murder.

14:46.310 --> 14:49.279
These two were front-runners
g0ing into this.

14:49.320 --> 14:53.017
Brendan Hagerty and Sam Lycette.

14:53.060 --> 14:56.450
Your boy Cory was gonna knock
one of them out of the running.
What's it worth?

14:56.490 --> 14:58.685
- Millions. And not
just to the player.

14:58.730 --> 15:01.449
There's managers, agents,
even the scouts get a piece.

15:01.500 --> 15:05.493
- So behind each boy
there's an army of adults
with their hands out. Nice.

15:05.530 --> 15:08.237
- There's also a lot of love for
the game. It's how we all start.

15:08.270 --> 15:11.262
- So much love. So much
millions of dollars.

15:11.310 --> 15:14.336
Hard to imagine which one wins.
- Hold on.

15:14.380 --> 15:15.836
Brendan's agent. Jamie Linfoot.

15:15.880 --> 15:19.509
She's got every GM on speed
dial, her endorsement
deals are legendary,

15:19.550 --> 15:22.212
but she was fired yesterday
by the kid's father--
- Pull over!

15:22.250 --> 15:26.311
What's going on?
- Pull over! It's my luclq day,
that's what.

15:28.290 --> 15:30.281
Stay here.

15:35.060 --> 15:38.097
- Yeah.

15:38.130 --> 15:42.032
City Hall asked me
to give this to you.

15:42.070 --> 15:44.459
It's important. Mr. Kempler?

15:48.740 --> 15:51.174
- That was Art Kempler,

15:51.210 --> 15:53.246
a dirty dirty politician who
will not let me serve him.

15:53.280 --> 15:57.284
- His loss.
- Serve him a subpoena. He hired
extra security to avoid me.

16:00.390 --> 16:02.210
This Jamie Linfoot.

16:02.260 --> 16:04.455
Who fired the world's
greatest agent, and why?

16:04.490 --> 16:08.290
That's who I want to talk to.
I think
I can set that up.

16:08.330 --> 16:11.993
- Trying to impress me with your
insider moves is not how you
build a trusting relationship.

16:12.030 --> 16:13.998
- Tell me more about
this relationship.

16:18.110 --> 16:21.307
- Hey, you're luclq Sam's not
charging you with assault.

16:21.340 --> 16:23.240
- Little busy, Bob,
can we dance later?

16:23.280 --> 16:26.249
- And it's me you'd have
to charge. Hey, Sam,
drop and give me 20?

16:26.280 --> 16:28.544
- Hey, ditch the loser
and I will.

16:28.580 --> 16:31.185
- Brendan Hagerty, Angie,

16:31.220 --> 16:35.213
father, Joel.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

16:35.260 --> 16:39.287
- Mr. Hagerty, I--
- So we hear you fired Jamie.
- Yeah, well, you know agents.

16:39.330 --> 16:41.548
They start thinking about their
percentage more than your kid.

16:41.600 --> 16:45.092
- And was Jamie's percentage
connected to Brendan's use
of PEDs last year?

16:45.130 --> 16:47.769
- Look, that was all on Jamie.

16:47.800 --> 16:50.735
She went behind my back. She
convinces my son to use PEDs,

16:50.770 --> 16:53.477
nearly cost him his career.
She found a way to cover it up.

16:53.510 --> 16:55.478
- Not as well
as she thinks.

16:55.510 --> 16:57.774
A doctor who's for sale
doesn't care who's buying.

16:57.810 --> 17:01.314
- This is made out to Jamie.
- And he just confirmed she got
them for Brendan.

17:01.350 --> 17:04.581
- OK, now look, after what
happened to Cory yesterday, that
was it for me. She had to go.

17:04.620 --> 17:08.784
- You think Jamie's
connected to what happened?
- I'm not saying that.

17:08.820 --> 17:12.654
Just this and...
I mean, she's unscrupulous.
I'm not taking any chances

17:12.690 --> 17:16.490
with Brendan's future.
- Wrong tree--

17:16.530 --> 17:18.794
- I took 'em that time,
and I'm ashamed I did it.

17:18.830 --> 17:22.539
But to sabotage another player?
I would never do that.
Cory's my friend.

17:22.570 --> 17:25.835
- And your stiffest competition.
- OK, alright, that's it.

17:25.870 --> 17:29.169
We're out of here. Let's go.
- I wouldn't for about
a million reasons,

17:29.210 --> 17:32.543
including the fact
that taking PEDs could
kill him. He had an aneurysm.

17:34.520 --> 17:36.511
- Not exactly...

17:39.320 --> 17:42.585
Brendan...
- Your daughter.

17:42.620 --> 17:46.226
VVhen
were you With Jules?

17:46.260 --> 17:48.820
- With you, sir.
She's been on the road
with you like a dozen times.

17:52.570 --> 17:56.062
- Let's go.

18:03.750 --> 18:07.277
- Brendan knew
about the aneurysm.

18:07.320 --> 18:10.289
That's what we usually
call suspicious.
- It means he didn't do it.

18:10.320 --> 18:12.709
- Because he's a good kid.

18:12.750 --> 18:15.548
- OK. The steroid they found
in Cory's blood was methan...

18:15.590 --> 18:18.229
- Methandrostenolone.
- Yeah. Three times
the recommended dose.

18:18.260 --> 18:21.252
That's the exact same drug
that Brendan used last year.
- I get that he lied about it,

18:21.300 --> 18:24.827
but it doesn't mean he's guilty.
- Oh, you're adorable. It's
like you've never ever read

18:24.870 --> 18:26.497
a newspaper
or a crime novel.

18:26.530 --> 18:30.239
There's millions of dollars
at stake here. If Cory took
that away from Brendan,

18:30.270 --> 18:33.501
he also took it away from Jamie.
They're both suspects.
- Alright.

18:33.540 --> 18:36.338
This feels like the point
in time where we need
some actual eVIdence,

18:36.380 --> 18:38.769
like finding the drugs.
- That'd be great,

18:38.810 --> 18:42.314
but I'm not a cop, I can't
subpoena a hockey bag
or an agent's briefcase.

18:42.350 --> 18:45.342
- What about searching
their hotel_rooms?
- "Excuse me, Sir or madam,

18:45.390 --> 18:48.257
please step aside while I toss
your room for illegal steroids"?

18:48.290 --> 18:50.258
- Who said anything
about asking?

18:54.930 --> 18:57.569
Does this key
work on every door?

18:59.530 --> 19:02.260
- That thing you did
with your key card--
- Highly illegal.

19:02.300 --> 19:05.303
- And if we get caught...
- Break and enter. So if we are
caught, we drank too much

19:05.340 --> 19:08.537
and ended up in the wrong room.
- "All these rooms
look the same."

19:08.580 --> 19:11.378
Got any more of those?
- No. No touching.

19:11.410 --> 19:15.210
So your friend Doug Gilmour--you
sure this autograph session's
gonna keep everyone in the bar?

19:15.250 --> 19:17.343
- Absolutely.
Everybody loves Dougie.

19:17.390 --> 19:20.450
- Like 45-minutes-nobody-comes-
UP
- Definitely.

19:20.490 --> 19:23.323
Except Dougie
couldn't make it.

19:23.360 --> 19:24.884
Then we need
to get out of here!

19:24.930 --> 19:28.491
- Relax, they're hockey players.
It'll take them at least
an hour to give up hope.

19:28.530 --> 19:30.521
Longer if they're
Leafs fans.

19:30.570 --> 19:33.892
- Fine. Tell me something
about Jamie, and don't
tell me her bra size.

19:33.940 --> 19:37.728
- 3ZB. Jamie has been Brendan's
agent for about six years.

19:37.770 --> 19:40.876
: Nothing would make me
happier than representing
your son.

19:40.910 --> 19:44.698
Let's order up a cocktail,
and I'll explain to you
how we'll make your son

19:44.750 --> 19:47.344
a millionaire.

19:47.380 --> 19:50.679
- What, you're no good
with heights?

19:50.720 --> 19:53.814
- It's definitely not my forte.
- We're four stories up.

19:53.860 --> 19:55.509
- "Up" being the key word.

19:55.560 --> 19:58.984
- This balcony is huge! I could
park the Porsche up here.

19:59.030 --> 20:01.351
- We'll have endorsement deals
as soon as he's drafted,

20:01.400 --> 20:04.369
I promise.
- If she had drugs in her room--
- I would have found them.

20:04.400 --> 20:06.391
- Which means it's time
we move on to Sam's room,
right next door.

20:06.430 --> 20:09.934
- Oh, that's convenient.
- Group rate. You should
be thankful.

20:09.970 --> 20:11.665
- You're not helping.

20:11.710 --> 20:13.598
- We're running out of time.
You can do this.
- Don't mock me.

20:13.640 --> 20:15.870
- I wasn't mocking you,
I was trying to be supportive.

20:15.910 --> 20:18.003
- Oh. OK.

20:30.930 --> 20:34.354
Back off! Back off,
I can do this!

20:34.400 --> 20:37.597
- Alright.

20:37.630 --> 20:40.861
Now's the time when you're
supposed to drop down
into the balcony.

20:40.900 --> 20:44.609
- I think I'm stuck.
- You're not stuck.

20:44.640 --> 20:46.403
- I'm definitely stuck.

20:46.440 --> 20:49.477
Ah! Thanks a lot.

20:52.650 --> 20:55.972
Show-off.
Alright, Sam's room.

20:59.450 --> 21:03.056
- Ooh, she should really
call for back-up.
- Teenage boys

21:03.090 --> 21:06.582
are disgusting.
- I've been to your office.
You could be a teenage boy.

21:08.600 --> 21:11.592
- My dad used to say that.

21:11.630 --> 21:14.793
- He died last year.
Car crash.

21:14.840 --> 21:17.400
- Oh. I'm sorry.

21:17.440 --> 21:20.307
- Thanks.

21:20.340 --> 21:22.479
- So you've been
going it alone since then?

21:22.510 --> 21:25.479
- I thought about closing it up,

21:25.510 --> 21:27.614
maybe going back to school.

21:32.820 --> 21:36.779
Breaking into hotel rooms
to root through hockey bags
looking for illegal steroids.

21:36.820 --> 21:39.084
We could be_arrested
at any minute.

21:39.130 --> 21:41.325
I love it.

21:46.870 --> 21:48.337
She's gone.

21:50.770 --> 21:53.102
Looks easy, but it's not.

21:53.140 --> 21:55.108
It's really actually not.

21:55.140 --> 21:57.074
- Don't worry. You're not
making it look easy.

22:01.880 --> 22:04.747
I'm gonna go check the bathroom.
- No touching.

22:04.790 --> 22:07.350
- Ugh!
- So, say we solve this,

22:07.390 --> 22:09.483
what's next
for Matt Shade?

22:09.520 --> 22:11.784
- When we solve it,
Cory's back on the ice

22:11.830 --> 22:14.094
with a clean record and I go
back to scouting full time.

22:14.130 --> 22:17.361
- Don't you have it
all figured out!
- And the head of the League

22:17.400 --> 22:19.561
promised me-- Wait a second.

22:19.600 --> 22:21.659
Those are Cory's gloves,
I bought them for him. Look.

22:21.700 --> 22:24.498
His initials.

22:24.540 --> 22:26.701
- I have no idea.
The paramedics removed them

22:26.740 --> 22:28.537
from Cory
when he hit the ice.

22:28.580 --> 22:31.674
Doesn't make sense
that Sam would grab them.

22:31.710 --> 22:34.417
Steroid cream.

22:34.450 --> 22:38.443
It's absorbed through the skin.
Sam put steroid cream
in Cory's gloves.

22:41.090 --> 22:43.729
- Let's get out of here.
- The disturbance was coming
from this room.

22:45.460 --> 22:47.155
- Hey, fellas!

22:47.190 --> 22:49.829
- Honey, why are there
guys in our room?
- I don't know, honey.

22:49.860 --> 22:53.159
Maybe they're bringing us
more champagne.
- Yeah!

22:53.200 --> 22:57.068
- I think that last margarita
really did me in.

22:58.810 --> 23:02.177
- Honey, I think we might be
in the wrong hotel room.

23:02.210 --> 23:06.044
- Oh, no!
- Guys, we can just forget
this whole thing ever happened.

23:06.080 --> 23:07.741
I'll get you tickets
behind the players' bench.

23:07.780 --> 23:09.816
- You're not a scout anymore.
You can't get those tickets.

23:09.850 --> 23:12.546
- I am basically back
in the scouting game.

23:12.590 --> 23:14.148
- Your pick went down.
- Yeah.

23:14.190 --> 23:18.729
- It was a publicity
stunt, come on!

23:18.760 --> 23:21.024
- The balconies were
part of the stunt.

23:21.060 --> 23:24.666
- Yes. They were filming us.

23:24.700 --> 23:27.999
You guys really don't
recognize who this is?

23:28.040 --> 23:31.407
It's Kim Kardashian!

23:35.840 --> 23:38.070
Thanks for getting us
out of a jam, Kim.

23:38.110 --> 23:40.476
Now, who are we meeting?
- I know a guy.

23:48.220 --> 23:51.656
- Oh, Angie.

23:51.690 --> 23:55.490
What was so important that we
had to meet here, in my least
favorite parking lot?

23:55.530 --> 23:59.091
- Ah, Kurtis. When have I
ever explained my weird
forensic needs to you?

23:59.130 --> 24:02.964
If you would be so kind,
check the residue inside.
We're looking for evidence

24:03.000 --> 24:05.798
of a steroid cream or gel.
- Sounds disgusting--

24:05.840 --> 24:08.832
naturally I'm intrigued.
Any other requests?

24:08.880 --> 24:11.474
- Tomorrow's better than
three weeks from now?
- Demanding.

24:11.510 --> 24:14.741
But I think I can help you.
Who's your shadow?

24:14.780 --> 24:18.841
- He doesn't know. Matt Shade.
He used to play hockey.

24:18.890 --> 24:21.085
- Professionally.
For a lot of money.
- Wow,

24:21.120 --> 24:23.725
Matt Shade... that's a PI name
ifI ever heard one.

24:23.760 --> 24:27.127
- I'll call you.
About the gloves.

24:27.160 --> 24:29.651
- Call me about Thursday too.
We still on for that, right?

24:29.700 --> 24:31.588
- Yep, we are.
- Good.

24:31.630 --> 24:35.088
Matt Shade.
- Detective.

24:35.140 --> 24:37.199
You know,
I read somewhere

24:37.240 --> 24:39.162
that a third of all cops
have erectile dysfunction.

24:39.210 --> 24:43.032
- So your last boyfriend
was a cop?

24:47.780 --> 24:51.238
Well, that was a day.

24:51.290 --> 24:54.088
- It was a good day,
right? I mean,

24:54.120 --> 24:57.089
not a good day, because Cory.
Oh, I gotta call his mom

24:57.120 --> 25:00.829
and see how he's doing.
- He's stable. I know
a nurse over there.

25:00.860 --> 25:02.953
- Of course you do.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.968
Thanks.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.195
- It's what I do.
- It's pretty cool, what you do.

25:07.230 --> 25:10.700
- What, get teenagers like Sam
arrested for attempted murder?

25:10.740 --> 25:13.709
- Eh, Sam's a thug.
If he's guilty, he
deserves to be punished.

25:13.740 --> 25:16.208
But that's not what
I was thinking about.

25:16.240 --> 25:20.176
- Were you thinking about
how you tried to push me
off the balcony?

25:20.210 --> 25:22.144
- I pushed you off a railing.

25:22.180 --> 25:25.217
And you needed help.
- OK. Keep telling yourself
that, Matt Shade,

25:25.250 --> 25:27.013
if it makes you feel better.

25:27.050 --> 25:30.156
But thanks. For the help.

25:30.190 --> 25:33.125
- Yeah, you too.

25:33.160 --> 25:35.196
So, same time tomorrow?

25:35.230 --> 25:38.119
- Ha! No. We're done.

25:38.170 --> 25:42.630
Sam had the gloves.
The tests will confirm PEDs.

25:42.670 --> 25:46.800
- You close cases, you move on.

25:46.840 --> 25:49.229
I'll call you with the results.

25:49.280 --> 25:53.000
- So we're not done.
- Good night, Shade.

25:56.250 --> 25:58.241
- Yeah, we're not done.

26:11.630 --> 26:15.134
StocloNell.

26:15.170 --> 26:17.365
Bobby.
- Heard about your balcony
hijinks today.

26:20.640 --> 26:23.746
Did you hear what I found?
- I hoped I could get
those back.

26:23.780 --> 26:26.169
- See, here's the thing.
The gloves we found are
being tested right now

26:26.210 --> 26:30.112
and I think we both know
what the lab's gonna find.
When do you start talking?

26:30.150 --> 26:32.289
- Apparently Bob told Sam
he'd better pray Cory
failed the drug test

26:32.320 --> 26:34.379
if he didn't want to lose
his shot at a contract.

26:34.420 --> 26:37.218
- I guess Sam
took him seriously.
- He filled the gloves

26:37.260 --> 26:40.889
with steroid cream. When Cory
went down, Sam panicked and
grabbed 'em off the ice.

26:40.930 --> 26:43.057
Told me about that tonight.
- Guess Sam better step up

26:43.100 --> 26:46.263
and admit what he did.
- We don't need the authorities
brought in.

26:46.300 --> 26:49.633
Let's not punish Sam
for an impulsive mistake
when he still has

26:49.670 --> 26:52.138
so much left to
achieve. Like you,

26:52.170 --> 26:54.900
as a full-time IPHL scout
with a nice salary.

26:54.940 --> 26:57.079
- You're really saying this to
me with Cory in the hospital?

26:57.110 --> 26:59.203
- I visited
his mother tonight.

26:59.250 --> 27:02.276
We're prepared to fund a full
scholarship for Cory.
When he gets better,

27:02.320 --> 27:05.039
he's well on his way
to a brand-new future.

27:05.090 --> 27:07.240
We'd love to have you
join the family.

27:09.220 --> 27:11.029
Think about it.

27:30.880 --> 27:33.007
- Oh good, you're here.

27:33.050 --> 27:35.848
Jules has something
she needs to talk about.

27:39.820 --> 27:42.186
- I told Brendan
about Cory's aneurysm.

27:42.220 --> 27:44.780
I don't know, it just
sort of came out.

27:44.830 --> 27:47.185
But if something happened
to him because I--

27:47.230 --> 27:49.323
- Honey, what happened
with Cory was an accident.

27:49.360 --> 27:52.067
That's all.
Just an accident.

27:54.200 --> 27:57.089
- Brendan had nothing
to do with it. I swear.

27:59.910 --> 28:02.401
- It's getting late, guys.

28:02.440 --> 28:04.078
- OK. I'm going.

28:04.110 --> 28:06.340
Night, Dad.
- Night, sweetie.

28:06.380 --> 28:09.076
- Night, Grandpa.
- Night, sweetie.

28:09.120 --> 28:11.111
Is any of that true?

28:11.150 --> 28:14.210
- Even if it's not,
it has to be.

28:14.260 --> 28:17.923
I don't want her to wear this.
- Kid's gotta learn.

28:17.960 --> 28:21.088
Same way you did.

28:23.530 --> 28:26.761
- Ha! It's that list
you made me write

28:26.800 --> 28:30.167
when I got drafted to Juniors.
"Seek Respect,

28:30.200 --> 28:33.829
Not Attention." "No Yachts."

28:33.880 --> 28:36.235
"There are No
Shortcuts to Success."
- You used to have that

28:36.280 --> 28:38.840
committed to heart.
- Only because you made me.

28:38.880 --> 28:41.314
"No Yachts" was a stupid rule.

28:41.350 --> 28:43.318
- No, it's a great one.

28:43.350 --> 28:46.114
Don't be tempted by easy money.

28:48.060 --> 28:49.789
Was that Stockwell
I saw out there?

28:49.820 --> 28:53.119
- I've worked hard to get back
in the game, Dad.

28:53.160 --> 28:56.323
If you ask me, I've delivered
on number five.

28:56.360 --> 29:00.126
- "Hustle Always Wins."

29:00.170 --> 29:03.139
- So there is
an offer on the table.
- It appears that way.

29:03.170 --> 29:06.139
Jules gets into that school,
I gotta figure out
a way to pay for it.

29:06.170 --> 29:09.173
Oh, come on.

29:09.210 --> 29:11.474
I'm trying to make a grown-up
decision for a change.

29:11.510 --> 29:14.809
- Yeah. I know you are, kid.

29:14.850 --> 29:17.375
Let's just hope
Cory gets better.

29:31.270 --> 29:34.194
The back door was open,
I figured I'd just let
myself in.

29:34.240 --> 29:36.196
Angie?

29:49.550 --> 29:53.145
- That's none of your business.
- You're right.

29:53.190 --> 29:56.250
- Give me five minutes, I--
- I brought you a cheque.

29:56.290 --> 29:58.281
- Suit's back on.

30:00.190 --> 30:02.351
What'd they offer you?

30:04.370 --> 30:06.463
- Uh, I'd rather work on Sam's
character than punish him

30:06.500 --> 30:08.468
for a rash decision.

30:08.500 --> 30:12.800
- I see. So you'll let Linda
know we gave up on her son.

30:14.540 --> 30:16.508
- Thanks for your time.

30:16.540 --> 30:20.101
-om1mmm.
Shortcut guy, right?

30:36.030 --> 30:39.067
The lab results on the gloves
show there was a steroid
cream InSIde,

30:39.100 --> 30:41.967
but the dosage was so low
it couldn't have been absorbed
into the bloodstream.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.366
- So Sam...
- Stupid, but innocent.

30:44.410 --> 30:47.299
- Then Cory's would-be killer
is still out there.

30:47.340 --> 30:49.877
You did see

30:49.910 --> 30:52.276
that I was already headed
back in here, right?

30:56.380 --> 30:59.315
- The analysis on Cory's
bloodwork suggests the PEDs
built up in his system

30:59.350 --> 31:02.387
over a couple of days.
- The length of the
prospects camp.

31:02.420 --> 31:05.583
- It's 24/7 hockey with these
guys, right? I mean, they're
always with each other.

31:05.630 --> 31:07.928
- Oh yeah.
- We need to look
at Brendan again.

31:07.960 --> 31:09.598
He used methandrostenolone...

31:09.630 --> 31:12.224
- But Jamie got the drugs for
Brendan, she covered it up.
- Sure,

31:12.270 --> 31:14.261
but where's her access to Cory?
Did you see her with him?

31:14.300 --> 31:16.268
- No.
- Brendan had access,

31:16.300 --> 31:19.406
motive, and he lied about using.
People don't change
who they are.

31:19.440 --> 31:21.408
- That's a pretty bleak
worldview.

31:21.440 --> 31:24.648
- Only if you get depressed
about it. Just run with it
for a second, OK?

31:24.680 --> 31:26.898
Something Cory
eats every day,

31:26.950 --> 31:29.145
drinks every day,
uses every day.

31:29.180 --> 31:32.547
- His toilet bag.

31:32.590 --> 31:35.616
Toothbrush, deodorant. Linda
told me he had a couple
of prescriptions

31:35.660 --> 31:39.949
for his heart condition: blood
thinner, beta-blockers...
- Look.

31:39.990 --> 31:43.096
That's methandrostenolone.
That's a common beta-blocker.

31:43.130 --> 31:44.825
- They're twins.

31:44.870 --> 31:48.636
Somebody could have switched out
his medication for PEDs and
Cory wouldn't have known.

31:48.670 --> 31:53.266
We gotta get to the hospital.
If you're right, the evidence
is in Cory's dopp kit.

31:55.680 --> 31:59.104
- I know you think
Brendan's a good kid,

31:59.150 --> 32:02.142
but it really looks
like he did this.
- My daughter,

32:02.180 --> 32:06.116
she told Brendan
about the aneurysm.

32:06.150 --> 32:09.688
If it's him, she's kinda
responsible too, in a way.

32:09.720 --> 32:12.553
I can't let her wear that.
- Then don't.

32:12.590 --> 32:15.150
Protect her. That's
what fathers do.

32:15.200 --> 32:18.397
- Yeah.

32:18.430 --> 32:22.093
Especially in hockey. Where
there's millions of dollars

32:22.140 --> 32:24.358
at stake. At that point, you're
not just protecting your son...

32:24.410 --> 32:27.664
- You're protecting
your entire future.
- Everything you've worked for.

32:27.710 --> 32:30.304
All those sacrifices.
- We need a plan.

32:37.620 --> 32:40.111
- He's doing great. He just went
to get an MRI, Linda's with him.

32:40.150 --> 32:43.210
I was hoping to talk
to Brendan about that day,

32:43.260 --> 32:45.182
whether he noticed
anything unusual.

32:45.230 --> 32:47.118
Is that OK with you, Joel?
- Yeah, I'll just wait here.

32:47.160 --> 32:50.095
- You could wait in Cory's room
if you want. 42-B.

32:50.130 --> 32:52.064
- OK.

32:52.100 --> 32:54.068
It's OK, son.
You've got nothing to hide.

32:54.100 --> 32:56.591
- Let's go over here.
Come on.

33:10.180 --> 33:12.148
The pill bottle's
not in there, Joel.

33:12.190 --> 33:15.751
You knew Cory had
a heart condition.
You switched out his meds.

33:15.790 --> 33:19.453
- Come on, that's crazy. I don't
know what you're talking about.
- Hey man, I get it.

33:19.490 --> 33:22.653
I know what it's like
to want it and there's nothing
I wouldn't do for my kid.

33:28.300 --> 33:31.463
You want money? You want money,
Shade? 'Cause once Brendan's in,

33:31.510 --> 33:34.172
there will be plenty to go
around. Especially now
that I got rid of Jamie.

33:34.210 --> 33:36.201
- Yes, that was smart,
what you did.

33:36.240 --> 33:38.276
Making her look like the fall
guy. Just enough suspicion

33:38.310 --> 33:40.346
to keep it
away from you.

33:40.380 --> 33:44.180
Did Brendan help? He told you
about the aneurysm, right?
- No.

33:44.220 --> 33:48.259
I saw the pills in Cory's
dopp kit. It was easy enough to
figure out what they were for.

33:49.320 --> 33:52.187
Come on, Shade,
it's nothing personal.

33:52.230 --> 33:54.221
- No, nothing personal.

33:56.230 --> 34:00.166
Alright, I'll take
Jamie's side of the action.
And I represent him.

34:00.200 --> 34:03.363
Exclusive.
- OK, but all this
stuff with Cory,

34:03.400 --> 34:06.733
you bury what you know, alright?
Then I'll take care of you.

34:10.640 --> 34:14.178
Shade, come on, man. Deal?

34:14.220 --> 34:16.142
- Deal.

34:16.180 --> 34:19.081
- I was worried
about the lighting in here,
but you look fantastic.

34:22.190 --> 34:24.158
- I gotta thank you, Joel.
- Let go--

34:24.190 --> 34:27.159
- Any thought I had about
returning to pro hockey,
you killed it.

34:38.570 --> 34:40.606
I got no problem
sending Joel to jail

34:40.640 --> 34:42.835
for what he did, but Brendan...

34:42.880 --> 34:45.348
it doesn't seem right, his
losing his dad over this.
- I know.

34:45.380 --> 34:48.247
But at least
he knows the truth.

34:48.280 --> 34:50.168
- Seems a pretty
lousy trade-off.

34:50.220 --> 34:52.609
- Yeah. It is.

34:57.920 --> 35:00.457
- Hey, buddy.

35:00.490 --> 35:03.288
Some nap!
- I guess I really needed it.

35:03.330 --> 35:05.298
- Yeah, I get that.

35:08.170 --> 35:12.129
- You've been playing with a
ticking time bomb in your chest.

35:12.170 --> 35:14.604
Doctor thinks you should
hang up your skates.

35:14.640 --> 35:16.631
Your mother agrees.

35:18.180 --> 35:22.139
- I think

35:22.180 --> 35:26.139
saying goodbye
to hockey is gonna hurt.

35:26.190 --> 35:29.751
I should know, I've been
putting it off for years.

35:29.790 --> 35:32.623
There's something else
out there for you.

35:34.530 --> 35:36.498
Something that'll get
under your skin the same way

35:36.530 --> 35:38.521
hockey did.

35:47.540 --> 35:49.804
- I know it.

35:51.580 --> 35:54.743
- * IfI was a paragon

35:54.780 --> 35:56.941
- Hey, Jules.

35:56.980 --> 35:59.414
- Hey, Cory.
- Hey, Cory.

36:02.360 --> 36:04.419
- Jules,

36:04.460 --> 36:06.621
I want you to hear this.

36:06.660 --> 36:09.652
Absolutely none of this happened
because you told Brendan.

36:09.700 --> 36:12.965
Got it?
- Got it. Thanks.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.298
- OK. Come on.

36:17.670 --> 36:20.764
- I'm OK.

36:23.240 --> 36:26.676
- You did good, Matt.
- Thanks, Dad.

36:26.710 --> 36:30.316
- * I'll keep whatever
we can make *

36:52.940 --> 36:57.309
* Oh...

36:59.880 --> 37:02.974
* Oh...

37:06.450 --> 37:09.487
* Oh...

37:11.690 --> 37:14.921
* Oh...

37:16.930 --> 37:19.990
* Oh...

37:24.410 --> 37:27.459
- So, you realize the blindfold
is overkill, right?

37:27.510 --> 37:30.502
- Not if I want to keep you
completely in the dark.

37:30.540 --> 37:33.976
So listen, about
that scouting job

37:34.010 --> 37:36.740
and how much time I'd actually
have to spend on the road...

37:36.780 --> 37:39.988
- It's OK. Me and Grandpa
will manage until Mom gets back

37:40.020 --> 37:44.059
from her globe-trotting.
- I didn't take the job.

37:46.060 --> 37:48.449
- Completely.

37:48.500 --> 37:50.991
Now, about Ellard--

37:51.030 --> 37:53.567
- They didn't call.
It's OK.

37:53.600 --> 37:56.467
Besides, Ellard's really hard

37:56.500 --> 37:59.367
and I'm just too different.

37:59.410 --> 38:02.971
- Hold on. You're
brilliant, insightful,

38:03.010 --> 38:06.798
way too clever,
you have a magnetic personality
that draws people in,

38:06.850 --> 38:09.512
and you also want
the power of sight?

38:09.550 --> 38:11.689
Come on, baby girl.

38:14.990 --> 38:18.084
Your fellow classmates
won't know what hit them

38:18.120 --> 38:20.680
as it stands.

38:20.730 --> 38:23.392
- You got in!

38:23.430 --> 38:26.968
- I GOT IN!!
- YOU GOT IN!

38:27.000 --> 38:30.458
- Wait, wait. It's so expensive.

38:30.500 --> 38:32.661
- Yeah, I got it covered.

38:34.680 --> 38:36.602
- Dad, where is your
championship ring?

38:36.640 --> 38:39.609
- You know what they should
call eBay? eMazing.

38:39.650 --> 38:42.471
- It's just a ring.

38:42.520 --> 38:44.613
This way I get to spend
more time with you,

38:44.650 --> 38:46.743
and besides, I was thinking

38:46.790 --> 38:50.681
maybe it's time for you to start
wearing the jewellery.

38:50.720 --> 38:54.554
- Thanks, Dad, I love it.
But what is it?

38:54.600 --> 38:56.989
- It's a code

38:57.030 --> 38:59.794
that your grandfather
had me write when I was 14.

39:04.070 --> 39:06.436
- "Family comes first."

39:06.470 --> 39:08.028
- Yeah.

39:08.070 --> 39:11.130
I'm working on that one.

39:11.180 --> 39:14.149
- OK, but seriously, what are
you going to do for a job?

39:14.180 --> 39:17.115
- I'm working on that too.

39:22.020 --> 39:24.079
- All right, Kempler.

39:24.120 --> 39:26.588
Today's the clay.

39:28.660 --> 39:31.595
- Hey, you're Matt Shade!

39:31.630 --> 39:34.531
- Yeah!
- No. No.

39:34.570 --> 39:37.038
- I was there that night you
scored the goal in overtime!

39:37.070 --> 39:39.630
- Funny story, that was actually
an accident. I was just trying

39:39.670 --> 39:42.002
to chip it over to Dougie,
next thing I knew, it was
in the top of the net--

39:42.980 --> 39:46.472
This seems like trouble.
Something wrong with my car?

39:46.510 --> 39:48.842
This is Matt Shade.

39:48.880 --> 39:51.417
Shadow. Best pest
in the League for years.

39:51.450 --> 39:53.179
- Forget about me,
you know who this is?

39:53.220 --> 39:55.654
Art Kempler.
- You don't say!

39:55.690 --> 39:58.784
- Rock star politician,
entrepreneur, bon vivant. Hell,

39:58.830 --> 40:00.957
you probably want his autograph.

40:00.990 --> 40:04.460
- No, you definitely
want his autograph.

40:04.500 --> 40:08.197
- Ha, ha, ha! And he's funny.

40:08.230 --> 40:11.529
You wouldn't happen to have some
sort of paper we could both
sign, would you, sweetheart?

40:11.570 --> 40:13.834
You know,
I'm also a multitasker,

40:13.870 --> 40:15.872
Art.
- I've heard that.

40:15.910 --> 40:18.606
- Well, you probably
haven't heard the latest.

40:18.650 --> 40:22.142
Has he, partner?
You've been served.

40:22.180 --> 40:25.047
You're kidding!

40:26.850 --> 40:29.580
- "You've been served".
I like the sounds of that.

40:29.620 --> 40:32.157
- No.

40:32.190 --> 40:35.193
- Definitely not.
- Teammate!

40:35.230 --> 40:37.858
- Not happening.
- Come on, I'm a good teammate!
- OK, stop.

40:37.900 --> 40:39.891
- You ask anyone I used to play
with, they'll tell ya.
- Just stop!

40:39.930 --> 40:43.536
Dream on, man.
- I'm a really good teammate!
- Not happening.

40:43.570 --> 40:46.061
