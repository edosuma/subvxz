00:26.789 --> 00:29.826
I love it when Mr. 
Burns shows a movie at work.

00:29.899 --> 00:31.340
I'm not sittin' up front with you guys.

00:31.412 --> 00:32.918
It's bad for your eyes.

00:33.571 --> 00:34.746
Suckers.

00:36.714 --> 00:40.088
Before we begin the movie, 
please join me in a moment

00:40.125 --> 00:43.834
of silence for the workers who 
gave their lives in an heroic....

00:43.947 --> 00:47.415
Mo-vie! Mo-vie! Mo-vie! Mo-vie! Mo-vie!

00:50.128 --> 00:51.455
The american worker:

00:51.555 --> 00:54.089
Proud, tough, hardworking.

00:54.125 --> 00:56.055
And tired!

00:56.180 --> 00:58.492
These jobs are killing us.

00:58.540 --> 01:00.763
Outsourcing, take them away!

01:04.533 --> 01:05.717
It's a miracle!

01:05.737 --> 01:08.509
They moved our factory 
to a third-world nation.

01:08.651 --> 01:10.458
Now I have more time to play the lottery.

01:10.541 --> 01:11.353
Ka-ching!

01:11.537 --> 01:14.968
Hey, america, why not let 
some of the other countries

01:14.992 --> 01:17.204
carry their share of the load?

01:17.345 --> 01:21.341
You can, with the best kind 
of sourcing: Outsourcing.

01:24.452 --> 01:25.419
what a great film.

01:25.604 --> 01:27.583
And I think it makes a terrific point:

01:27.854 --> 01:30.646
Effective immediately, I'm closing the plant

01:30.691 --> 01:33.451
and moving all operations to India.

01:34.857 --> 01:36.443
Does this mean we're losing our jobs?

01:36.517 --> 01:37.648
No, no.

01:37.709 --> 01:39.205
Your jobs are safe.

01:39.226 --> 01:42.002
They'll just be done by someone 
else in another country.

01:42.125 --> 01:45.004
No! I just bought a $3 million house!

01:45.217 --> 01:49.053
However, federal law requires I keep 
one union worker on the payroll.

01:49.078 --> 01:52.730
So, congratulations, whoever 
catches this bouquet!

02:00.915 --> 02:02.137
Woo-hoo! I win!

02:02.181 --> 02:04.185
In your face, best friends!

02:04.846 --> 02:06.838
You've been transferred to India!?

02:07.145 --> 02:10.883
Hey, Marge, it's what I gotta do to 
keep this family living in luxury.

02:11.310 --> 02:14.510
Luxury? This thermostat is just painted on.

02:14.558 --> 02:15.578
My god! You're right.

02:15.652 --> 02:16.930
I'd better call the guy.

02:18.878 --> 02:19.972
Send someone right over.

02:20.095 --> 02:21.134
Here he is.

02:24.280 --> 02:26.038
Dad, that's Mac tonight.

02:26.407 --> 02:28.793
Yeah? Well, while I'm gone, 
you'll do what he says.

02:35.201 --> 02:38.123
What's a Macgyver, and why 
does it have a convention?

02:38.201 --> 02:40.537
Macgyver was a show about a secret agent

02:40.574 --> 02:44.303
who used inventions made of everyday 
objects to defeat bad guys.

02:44.343 --> 02:49.728
And he was played by the three greatest 
names in the history of television:

02:49.814 --> 02:52.838
Richard Dean Anderson.

02:53.033 --> 02:54.947
Did someone mention my names?

02:55.022 --> 02:57.567
Richard Dean Anderson!

03:01.431 --> 03:04.111
You finally came to our convention!

03:04.173 --> 03:09.172
No. I'm looking for the convention 
for my new show, Stargate: SG1.

03:09.947 --> 03:10.345
That.

03:10.393 --> 03:11.389
It's over there.

03:11.659 --> 03:13.319
Star-gate, S.G.-One!

03:13.319 --> 03:15.163
Star-gate, S.G.-One!

03:15.527 --> 03:17.322
You're into Macgyver?

03:17.347 --> 03:19.926
That show was so stupid.

03:19.965 --> 03:23.421
"Oh, I'm Macgyver. I can make a bomb

03:23.444 --> 03:26.049
out of a banana peel and a toaster."

03:26.785 --> 03:30.149
That show was just a paycheck 
to me, and nothing more.

03:34.626 --> 03:36.391
How could he say that?

03:36.537 --> 03:38.454
Macgyver is my world.

03:38.636 --> 03:44.181
Richard Dean Anderson just pissed off 
the wrong Richard Dean Anderson fans!

03:44.402 --> 03:45.519
Star-gate...!

03:45.573 --> 03:48.940
Richard Dean Anderson, of the four "star" franchises:

03:48.966 --> 03:51.738
-Wars, -trek, -gate, and -search,

03:51.853 --> 03:54.238
"-gate" is easily my third favorite.

03:54.300 --> 03:55.733
I get that a lot.

03:56.009 --> 03:57.552
Question S.G.-One:

03:57.583 --> 03:59.165
How would your character, major general

03:59.190 --> 04:03.383
Jonathan "Jack" O'Neill, react to 
appearing at the Springfield stargate

04:03.419 --> 04:04.219
fanfest?

04:04.342 --> 04:09.141
I feel like I've just gone through the 
stargate to one heck of a convention!

04:11.776 --> 04:13.643
He's aware of us!

04:16.462 --> 04:18.522
What in the name of Steve Ditko?!

04:18.605 --> 04:19.949
Hey, let go!

04:19.949 --> 04:21.043
Hey, watch the face!

04:21.055 --> 04:22.620
I need that for acting!

04:23.878 --> 04:25.457
He's gone!

04:25.594 --> 04:28.473
There must be a Stargate in this stadium!

04:28.557 --> 04:30.204
Everybody, look for it!

04:32.055 --> 04:34.543
Wait, wait. I have some even more exciting news!

04:34.920 --> 04:36.440
There is a girl in the audience!

04:36.481 --> 04:37.923
Everybody look for her!

04:40.514 --> 04:43.494
This is a kilt, and I'm not a girl!

04:43.514 --> 04:45.575
You're as close as we'll ever get!

04:45.662 --> 04:46.523
Get him!

04:58.647 --> 04:59.847
Surprise!

04:59.884 --> 05:00.866
This is kidnapping!

05:00.904 --> 05:02.195
People are gonna know I'm missing.

05:02.243 --> 05:04.645
There's a liquor store I go to every morning.

05:04.665 --> 05:06.964
This isn't a kidnapping.

05:06.964 --> 05:09.453
No. Think of it as a two-on-one

05:09.489 --> 05:11.113
Macgyver convention.

05:11.309 --> 05:14.703
That will never, never end.

05:14.991 --> 05:17.745
First, you're gonna sign a couple of autographs.

05:22.161 --> 05:24.261
You can write "help me" all you want.

05:24.388 --> 05:26.667
No one will ever see it.

05:29.371 --> 05:31.419
Dad, we'll miss you so much.

05:31.985 --> 05:33.493
I'll miss you kids, too.

05:33.567 --> 05:34.537
Attention.

05:34.600 --> 05:38.325
India air flight 57 now boarding first class,

05:38.423 --> 05:40.361
small children and fat guys.

05:40.612 --> 05:41.361
That's me!

05:41.397 --> 05:44.363
Homie, I got you something to read on the plane.

05:45.949 --> 05:47.781
A book?

05:48.332 --> 05:49.992
"Secrets I learned at breakfast"?

05:50.148 --> 05:52.472
The cereal's just a metaphor.

05:52.584 --> 05:55.830
It's a book about management, 
and Lee Iacocca says

05:55.866 --> 05:59.039
it's "definitely dot dot dot useful."

05:59.167 --> 06:00.298
Thanks, sweetie.

06:00.408 --> 06:03.272
I've never been less angry to receive a book.

06:19.198 --> 06:20.354
this isn't India!

06:20.415 --> 06:22.224
Where's the university of Notre Dame,

06:22.249 --> 06:25.465
the indy 500, Wrigley Field, Dodger Dogs?

06:25.552 --> 06:28.158
You ignorant american, you have 
confused India with Indiana,

06:28.171 --> 06:32.080
Indiana with Illinois, and the Cubs with the Dodgers.

06:32.142 --> 06:36.045
No! I took a job on the other side of the world!

06:36.144 --> 06:39.622
I hate this subcontinent!

06:45.262 --> 06:45.691
Hello.

06:45.745 --> 06:46.820
Lisa, it's me!

06:46.932 --> 06:47.736
I'm in trouble!

06:47.843 --> 06:49.460
Calm down, dad.What happened?

06:49.507 --> 06:51.960
A cow took my iPod and I punched it!

06:57.210 --> 06:58.420
Do I have to?

06:58.675 --> 07:01.763
Okay, okay, I'll showthe cow I adore it.

07:06.010 --> 07:08.963
Baby, did you lose weight?

07:10.270 --> 07:13.066
Come on, baby,don't play hard to milk.

07:17.180 --> 07:20.070
Okay, Apu said his cousin kavicould help me out.

07:20.380 --> 07:21.232
Let's see...

07:21.360 --> 07:25.773
Apu's cousin is medium height, dark 
complexion, brown eyes, black hair.

07:28.663 --> 07:30.077
Are you Kavi? No.

07:30.224 --> 07:32.092
Are you Kavi? Yes.

07:32.640 --> 07:33.934
You must bemr. Homer.

07:34.006 --> 07:35.498
Finally!

07:38.323 --> 07:39.283
He's escaped.

07:39.761 --> 07:41.326
We'll be bustedfor kidnapping.

07:41.404 --> 07:42.985
I can't face jail.

07:43.220 --> 07:44.065
I can.

07:48.668 --> 07:50.536
Richard Dean Anderson.

07:50.689 --> 07:51.795
Why did you come back?

07:51.975 --> 07:53.853
To tell youhow I escaped.

07:55.223 --> 07:58.719
I had to get out before another 
one of your bristly kisses.

07:58.836 --> 08:02.947
Then I remembered the blue contacts 
I wear to hide my latino heritage.

08:16.808 --> 08:22.057
Now all I needed was a sling strong 
enough to support my 200-pound frame.

08:25.831 --> 08:27.959
A-bra-cada-bra.

08:35.501 --> 08:37.222
Macgyver lives.

08:37.260 --> 08:39.942
And not just at 2:00 A.M.On the USA network.

08:40.179 --> 08:42.528
My real life escapefrom your love dungeon

08:42.558 --> 08:44.605
was the most excitingthing I've ever done.

08:44.739 --> 08:45.585
It was?

08:45.636 --> 08:47.358
Tie me up soI can do it again.

08:47.551 --> 08:49.471
But this timedon't make it so easy.

08:49.522 --> 08:50.232
No.

08:50.798 --> 08:51.539
Delighted.

08:58.204 --> 08:58.851
Too much?

08:59.327 --> 09:00.496
Not for Macgyver.

09:21.539 --> 09:23.219
why did you want to makean entrance like that, sir?

09:23.393 --> 09:24.875
I am a showman.

09:25.597 --> 09:30.262
Welcome, new employees, of the 
Bangalore nuclear power plant.

09:30.547 --> 09:32.665
The energy generated here 
is transmitted through

09:32.748 --> 09:35.868
undersea cables right back to america.

09:37.020 --> 09:40.808
You know, moe,that sign is 
powered by non-american workers.

09:40.942 --> 09:44.052
So what? Your beer's germanand the TV's japanese.

09:44.112 --> 09:46.543
Well, is there anythingin this 
bar that's made in America?

09:46.756 --> 09:47.674
Just this.

09:49.510 --> 09:51.128
God! Misfire!

09:51.373 --> 09:54.107
Now I'd like to introduce 
you to your new manager.

09:54.277 --> 09:57.178
You'll find his integrityand 
dedication make him...

09:57.521 --> 09:58.971
untouchable.

10:00.936 --> 10:01.792
Sorry I'm late.

10:01.927 --> 10:03.669
I was doing carnac with my bodyguard.

10:06.076 --> 10:07.412
Hindu.

10:09.958 --> 10:12.713
What do you callthe moisture on your hin?

10:14.641 --> 10:15.194
classic.

10:15.565 --> 10:17.923
Now, tell them howto run a nuclear plant.

10:29.838 --> 10:30.506
Did I say "um"?

10:34.591 --> 10:35.729
Man, what do I do?

10:36.079 --> 10:37.790
Wait, the book Marge gave me.

10:41.050 --> 10:43.784
Okay, book, I didn't read 
you and you didn't read me,

10:43.949 --> 10:45.243
but we're bothin this together.

10:45.494 --> 10:48.385
So say something smart or get 
ready to run like hell.

10:50.645 --> 10:56.196
"In business as in breakfast, 
fried eggs have fragile yolks."

11:11.774 --> 11:13.297
He's got them eating out of his hand.

11:13.486 --> 11:15.385
And to think you doubted him, Smithers.

11:16.025 --> 11:19.375
Sir, can we talk about this 
arranged marriage of mine?

11:26.550 --> 11:26.925
Yello.

11:27.006 --> 11:29.563
Dad, I got to write a 
report on the Great Lakes.

11:29.626 --> 11:31.118
Just outsource it to Lisa.

11:31.234 --> 11:33.436
Outsourcing is the answer to everything.

11:33.682 --> 11:35.466
Also, I can't sleep at night

11:35.516 --> 11:38.740
'cause there's this new bully 
who follows me home, and...

11:39.430 --> 11:40.786
I think he's in the house.

11:42.370 --> 11:43.100
Outsourcing.

11:43.933 --> 11:46.322
I'm very glad to see you favor outsourcing.

11:46.459 --> 11:49.297
I myself have found work with 
several american companies.

11:51.342 --> 11:52.855
Ibm help line, this is Brian.

11:53.982 --> 11:55.724
Have you tried disabling your firewall?

11:56.835 --> 11:58.327
Dallas fort-worth marriott.

11:58.377 --> 11:59.160
How can I help y'all?

11:59.465 --> 12:01.177
Well, we have a cotton bowl special.

12:01.276 --> 12:02.038
Go aggies!

12:02.853 --> 12:04.408
This is queen mama jumbo.

12:04.452 --> 12:06.539
The stars tell me you have a question.

12:07.089 --> 12:09.907
No, jenny, don't be dating that boy.

12:09.956 --> 12:13.431
The bones don't lie. He's bad mojo, girl.

12:16.686 --> 12:17.688
Next.

12:19.087 --> 12:20.412
Okay, here's the plan.

12:20.614 --> 12:22.179
You lock me in the trunk of a car

12:22.231 --> 12:24.125
and park it under the pier at low tide.

12:24.354 --> 12:26.545
All I need are these everyday objects:

12:26.618 --> 12:29.894
A nail file, a farmer's almanac, 
a gun with no bullets,

12:30.049 --> 12:32.334
some bullets and three of 
my Macgyver writers.

12:32.388 --> 12:34.340
Sounds great.

12:34.596 --> 12:36.214
Can we do it during lunch?

12:36.513 --> 12:37.964
Now!

12:41.094 --> 12:43.108
Simpson, I don't know how you're doing it,

12:43.433 --> 12:45.655
but you're out putting ten times the power

12:45.699 --> 12:47.180
our american plant ever did.

12:47.534 --> 12:49.423
Well, a little bookonce told me...

12:51.746 --> 12:55.220
Having only one pancake 
leaves room for more bacon.

12:58.315 --> 12:59.995
I see what you're saying.

13:00.229 --> 13:02.045
We're crowding your plate.

13:02.277 --> 13:04.729
In fact, there's no need for 
us to be here at all.

13:04.818 --> 13:05.757
Let's go, Smithers.

13:05.867 --> 13:08.017
You're giving meabsolute power?

13:09.755 --> 13:11.320
Sir, doesn't that corrupt?

13:11.492 --> 13:13.015
Absolutely not.

13:13.144 --> 13:16.452
When it comes to runninga nuclear
power plant this man's a god.

13:19.339 --> 13:21.885
Now, if you'll excuse me, 
I'm late fora dinner engagement.

13:22.190 --> 13:24.924
I don't want myscooped out 
monkey head to get cold.

13:28.384 --> 13:29.469
I'm not a god.

13:29.695 --> 13:33.305
God has a white beardand 
invented the Da Vinci Code.

13:33.485 --> 13:36.532
Actually, in our system of belief, 
there are many gods.

13:37.714 --> 13:38.541
Let's see...

13:38.678 --> 13:39.888
got the elephant man..

13:40.096 --> 13:42.872
Johnny Six-Arms, papa Smurf.

13:43.026 --> 13:44.294
These guysare pretty cool.

13:44.582 --> 13:45.845
Maybe I am one of them.

13:46.737 --> 13:49.054
If only I had some kind of proof.

13:50.528 --> 13:51.655
I won a free soda!

13:51.867 --> 13:53.829
I am a god!

14:01.488 --> 14:04.556
Sir, I really don't think we should 
have left Simpson in charge.

14:04.776 --> 14:06.049
No office talk.

14:06.256 --> 14:08.948
I'm floating down the 
ganges with my new chums.

14:09.164 --> 14:10.187
Those are corpses.

14:10.333 --> 14:11.929
You never like my friends.

14:16.340 --> 14:17.456
what's going on ?

14:17.527 --> 14:20.453
We flew all the way out here 
'cause Homer sent us this crazy card.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.850
Behind one of these doors is Homer simpson.

14:28.946 --> 14:30.714
Behind the other, a Bengal tiger.

14:30.857 --> 14:31.776
Choose wisely.

14:44.698 --> 14:45.893
Both doors have tigers!

14:45.964 --> 14:48.520
One of those tigers is named Homer simpson.

14:52.476 --> 14:54.284
Welcome home!

14:54.645 --> 14:56.264
Guess who made Macgyver burgers?

14:56.925 --> 14:57.560
Macgyver

14:58.080 --> 14:59.652
We didn't have any ground beef

14:59.770 --> 15:03.083
Yeah, but you did have 
slim jims, a cheese grater

15:03.123 --> 15:05.187
and rubber bands to hold it all together.

15:08.661 --> 15:10.062
We got to get rid of this cook.

15:10.199 --> 15:11.366
I got an idea.

15:12.106 --> 15:13.635
Which episode are we watching tonight?

15:13.829 --> 15:15.720
"L is for Lake Tahoe: Part II"?

15:16.002 --> 15:17.708
"Bless me, Macgyver,for I have sinned"?

15:17.773 --> 15:22.457
We thought maybe you would like to 
see some of our globetrotting adventures.

15:25.819 --> 15:28.644
This is Selma in line at the luray caverns.

15:29.135 --> 15:31.257
It turned out it was the 
line for the ladies' room.

15:31.691 --> 15:33.195
This is the ladies' room.

15:35.422 --> 15:38.498
This is us at the Alberta, Canada carriage museum.

15:39.215 --> 15:40.090
That's a phaeton.

15:40.573 --> 15:41.086
Landau.

15:41.803 --> 15:42.317
Buckboard.

15:43.051 --> 15:43.925
Postchaise.

15:44.327 --> 15:44.773
Surrey.

15:45.538 --> 15:45.996
Surrey.

15:46.559 --> 15:47.127
Surrey.

15:47.563 --> 15:49.229
Selma. Surrey.

15:49.690 --> 15:51.114
You're in a tight spot, Macgyver.

15:51.327 --> 15:54.192
This calls for your most 
ingenious escape ever.

15:55.129 --> 15:58.050
This olive garden coupon! 
It expires at midnight.

15:58.242 --> 15:59.650
You're not holding a coupon.

16:01.163 --> 16:02.314
Macgyver away!

16:06.116 --> 16:07.398
Well, he's gone.

16:07.623 --> 16:08.119
Yeah.

16:08.241 --> 16:10.810
And we'll always have what he 
wrote on our window shade.

16:12.605 --> 16:13.812
What did he write that in?

16:14.038 --> 16:16.058
Grape juice and tears.

16:18.718 --> 16:19.989
+ This is the end

16:21.723 --> 16:25.345
+ my only friend, the end...

16:28.481 --> 16:31.647
So, Mr. Burns, you're saying 
my dad has gone insane

16:31.651 --> 16:35.197
and thinks he's a god and broken off 
all contact with the outside world?

16:35.449 --> 16:37.721
I told you Simpson was a poor choice, sir.

16:37.852 --> 16:40.190
You know, Smithers,"I told you so" has a brother.

16:40.293 --> 16:41.838
His name is "shut the hell up"!

16:42.115 --> 16:43.940
A-bom-shabai

16:44.470 --> 16:46.251
A-bom-shabai

16:46.823 --> 16:48.775
A-bom-shabai

16:48.875 --> 16:49.262
Mom,

16:49.473 --> 16:50.343
I'm scared.

16:50.986 --> 16:52.905
A-bom-shabai

16:53.336 --> 16:55.120
A-bom-shabai

16:55.588 --> 16:57.442
A-bom-shabai

16:58.015 --> 16:59.747
A-bom-shabai

17:00.364 --> 17:02.447
A-bom-shabai

17:02.819 --> 17:04.710
A-bom-shabai

17:05.093 --> 17:08.840
Should we take all our stuff, or are
we coming back on this boat, too?

17:09.009 --> 17:10.749
Same boat, but take it anyway.

17:11.068 --> 17:14.298
They use the boat for a Dixie 
land booze cruise while we're gone.

17:36.914 --> 17:37.447
Silence!

17:38.440 --> 17:42.188
Now for my amusement, let 
the monkey fight the elephant.

17:52.077 --> 17:54.944
Homie, stop! You're not a god!

17:55.045 --> 17:55.422
Marge?

17:55.800 --> 17:58.318
You're just a sweet guy from Springfield

17:58.322 --> 18:00.809
who wanted his family to have a better life

18:01.196 --> 18:03.913
Wha, wha, I... I am a god!

18:04.051 --> 18:05.057
I know all.

18:05.496 --> 18:07.206
Yeah, what's mom's birthday?

18:07.445 --> 18:08.904
It's...

18:09.407 --> 18:10.866
jan...

18:11.268 --> 18:12.739

18:12.815 --> 18:14.085

18:14.169 --> 18:15.349
it's may!

18:15.456 --> 18:16.110
May!

18:16.558 --> 18:17.887
Fir...

18:18.162 --> 18:19.001
secon...

18:19.253 --> 18:20.620
thir...

18:20.638 --> 18:21.910
you don't have to worship him.

18:21.913 --> 18:23.172
He's not a god.

18:23.273 --> 18:26.381
We follow him because of the secrets he tells us.

18:26.461 --> 18:27.412
What secrets?

18:27.760 --> 18:30.381
He told us of overtime pay.

18:30.501 --> 18:31.827
And coffee breaks.

18:32.001 --> 18:33.207
And flex time.

18:33.209 --> 18:34.478
Casual fridays.

18:34.491 --> 18:35.462
On-site daycare.

18:35.464 --> 18:37.071
Low dental co-pays.

18:37.091 --> 18:39.169
Muffin basketson your birthday.

18:39.175 --> 18:41.264
With mylar balloons.

18:41.536 --> 18:43.655
Mylar balloons.

18:43.881 --> 18:45.943
Mylar balloons. Mylar balloons.

18:46.199 --> 18:48.151
Mylar balloons.

18:48.300 --> 18:50.676
This man told you about these things?

18:50.948 --> 18:53.746
Yes. In fact, he gave them to 
us in a binding contract.

18:54.217 --> 18:56.795
A-bom-shabai means "vote union.

18:57.050 --> 18:58.891
A-bom-shabai.

18:59.436 --> 19:01.160
A-bom-shabai.

19:01.399 --> 19:03.711
Up until now,I was with you.

19:03.941 --> 19:06.923
Even the beast-on-beast combat, 
that had potential.

19:08.723 --> 19:12.359
But treating employees like 
human beings, that is madness!

19:12.719 --> 19:14.407
You appear ill, Sahib.

19:14.553 --> 19:16.630
Maybe you should take a personal day.

19:16.740 --> 19:18.788
Take one of mine. 
They are transferable.

19:20.181 --> 19:21.670
I'm proud of you, dad.

19:21.810 --> 19:24.638
You're the first man to ever 
outsource the american worker's

19:24.659 --> 19:27.127
sense of entitlement and privilege.

19:27.220 --> 19:30.236
Well, I'm just glad I'm not a god anymore.

19:30.496 --> 19:31.453
I want to go home.

19:31.744 --> 19:32.832
How's chief Wiggum?

19:34.036 --> 19:37.107
He was gravely wounded in a bank shootout.

19:37.475 --> 19:39.705
Yeah, he's funny.

19:42.591 --> 19:45.042
where the workers are more desperate and ignorant;

19:45.693 --> 19:47.035
Springfield.

19:47.727 --> 19:48.517
You're fired!

19:48.713 --> 19:49.744
You're all fired!

19:49.998 --> 19:52.206
Fired! Fired! Fired!

19:53.074 --> 19:53.902
Two months severance!

19:53.911 --> 19:55.270
Early retirement!

19:55.296 --> 19:56.933
Golden parachutes for all!

20:41.332 --> 20:43.563
Go ahead and join them, Smithers.

20:43.972 --> 20:45.500
I know you want to.

20:45.922 --> 20:47.054
Yes, sir!
