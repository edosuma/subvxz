NARRATOR: <i>The Vikings in Europe
of the eighth and ninth century</i>

00:33.093 --> 00:38.056
<i>were dedicated to a pagan
god of war, Odin.</i>

00:39.892 --> 00:43.478
<i>Cramped by the confines
of their barren, icebound northlands,</i>

00:43.645 --> 00:46.190
<i>they exploited their skill as shipbuilders</i>

00:46.315 --> 00:51.528
<i>to spread a reign of terror
then unequalled in violence and brutality</i>

00:51.653 --> 00:54.531
<i>in all the records of history.</i>

00:54.990 --> 00:57.075
<i>The greatest wish of every Viking</i>

00:57.201 --> 01:01.288
<i>was to die sword in hand
and enter Valhalla,</i>

01:01.413 --> 01:05.083
<i>where a hero's welcome
awaited them from the god Odin.</i>

01:08.670 --> 01:10.923
<i>The compass was unknown,</i>

01:11.048 --> 01:14.968
<i>and they could steer only
by the sun and the stars.</i>

01:18.639 --> 01:23.310
<i>Once fog closed in,
they were left helpless and blind.</i>

01:23.435 --> 01:25.979
<i>After all, the earth was flat.</i>

01:26.104 --> 01:29.858
<i>Sail too far off course,
and the black wind would blow them</i>

01:30.025 --> 01:32.653
<i>across the poison sea that lay to the west</i>

01:32.778 --> 01:36.281
<i>and over the edge of the world into limbo.</i>

01:38.951 --> 01:41.912
<i>Their abiding aim was to conquer England,</i>

01:42.037 --> 01:47.751
<i>then a series of petty kingdoms,
each one the jealous rival of the next.</i>

01:48.460 --> 01:52.214
<i>Thus, when the Vikings set forth
to rob and plunder England,</i>

01:52.339 --> 01:55.217
<i>they never sailed out of sight of land.</i>

01:55.342 --> 01:59.388
<i>They confined their attacks
to swift overnight raids.</i>

01:59.513 --> 02:03.976
<i>It was no accident that the English book
of prayer contained this sentence:</i>

02:04.101 --> 02:08.312
<i>"Protect us, oh Lord,
from the wrath of the Northmen."</i>

the good King Edwin,

who by the cruel Viking Ragnar
was foully murdered,

03:43.867 --> 03:47.704
and still lies unrevenged.

03:47.871 --> 03:53.752
The council of the kingdom now declare
that Aella is of the true royal line

Rest assured that the barbarians
that murdered your husband, my cousin,

04:27.077 --> 04:29.997

was fruitless,

the respect of us all.

There is an heir.

05:10.078 --> 05:14.625
Brother Godwin, I am with child.
But not Edwin's.

but I love him as if he were Edwin's child.

06:36.874 --> 06:41.128
There are already rumours of his birth.
If they were to reach Aella...

06:41.253 --> 06:43.088
Where are you sending him?

06:43.213 --> 06:48.260
To Italy, to be tended by monks
who will not know his identity.

I hope soon to silence
these wagging tongues.

with an heir to the throne.

never been attacked by the Vikings?

What do you mean, sire?

09:25.042 --> 09:29.087
Neither your lands nor those of your
conspirators have suffered any harm.

- Conspirators?!
- You have schemed against me.

Drunk, am I? I haven't had enough!

28:59.758 --> 29:01.802
(CHEERING)

29:06.098 --> 29:08.433
You missed her, didn't you?

29:14.398 --> 29:16.692
What a son!

29:36.295 --> 29:38.213
Kitala.

29:38.338 --> 29:41.383
Kitala, my legs, my legs...

29:41.508 --> 29:45.179
Move your legs, Eric. You must move them.

30:00.194 --> 30:04.698
- Where did this slave boy come from?
- Bjorn brought him here from a raid.

30:04.823 --> 30:08.243
He was taken from a ship on the sea.

30:08.368 --> 30:11.121
- And this was found about his neck?
- Yes.

30:11.246 --> 30:15.459
It's the only possession he ever had.
He has no need of it now.

30:15.584 --> 30:17.502
(ERIC SPLUTTERS)

30:24.801 --> 30:27.095
He's going to die.

30:27.221 --> 30:32.893
Listen to me, little slave. Einar is
in the hall celebrating your death!

30:33.018 --> 30:35.729
Einar is laughing at you!

30:35.854 --> 30:38.398
Einar... Einar.

30:38.857 --> 30:43.987
- Live, Eric. Fight the cold.
- Live and fight Einar.

30:45.614 --> 30:49.910
Fight Einar. Fight Einar.

30:51.453 --> 30:56.083
Odin. Odin.

30:56.208 --> 30:58.168
Odin!

31:09.429 --> 31:12.975
- Odin has answered you.
- They were only flying clouds.

31:13.100 --> 31:17.688
You're blind. They were Odin's daughters.

31:17.813 --> 31:22.609
I heard the singing of their battle
swords as they rode across the sky.

31:22.734 --> 31:24.945
They bring the wind.

31:25.487 --> 31:27.531
They bring the wind!

31:29.825 --> 31:30.993
Listen to it.

31:32.744 --> 31:34.788
(WIND WHISTLING)

32:25.380 --> 32:28.383
(LAUGHTER)

32:44.274 --> 32:49.488
The north wind, it's turning back
the tide. Cut him loose.

32:53.867 --> 32:57.538
The tide is going out. Your job is done.

33:34.366 --> 33:36.910
EINAR: I'll take the slave.

33:40.831 --> 33:45.210
He's mine, Einar! The wind
turned the tide and I pulled him out.

33:45.335 --> 33:48.005
I'll take him, Englishman.

33:48.130 --> 33:51.425
If your father's word
means anything, he's mine.

33:51.550 --> 33:55.220
Why such a sudden interest
in a slave, my lord?

33:55.345 --> 33:58.599
Shall we say, an English passion
for converting the wicked

33:58.724 --> 34:02.227
to the paths of righteousness.

34:04.104 --> 34:07.149
Well, you're not in England now.

34:08.358 --> 34:12.654
And you never will be unless
I draw maps of England for your father.

34:19.703 --> 34:21.830
All right.

34:21.996 --> 34:26.585
You can keep the slave...
for as long as you live.

34:34.551 --> 34:40.349
- Odin's thanks for saving him.
- And at no little risk to myself.

34:43.601 --> 34:46.438
Do you know what this is?

34:49.065 --> 34:51.693
Some day, I'll tell you what it is.

34:51.818 --> 34:55.489
And you'll remember then that I saved you.

35:21.765 --> 35:23.559
I'm still a slave.

35:23.684 --> 35:27.688
- You won't be when we get to England.
- I'll never get to England.

35:27.813 --> 35:31.400
You're like a wounded animal.
You trust no one.

35:31.567 --> 35:33.735
- Good day, my lords.
- Hail, Egbert!

35:33.861 --> 35:37.364
- How's the boat coming along?
- She'll be ready in a week.

35:37.489 --> 35:40.409
Well, she's no sea dragon,
but she'll do for a toy.

35:40.534 --> 35:42.911
Does Einar still bear me a grudge?

35:43.078 --> 35:46.248
You were a fool to anger my son.
He'll kill you one day.

35:46.373 --> 35:49.543
You're not still angry, are you, Einar?

35:49.668 --> 35:52.337
- That depends.
- On what?

35:55.340 --> 35:57.384
On how well you draw maps.

35:58.802 --> 36:02.472
See for yourself. This is a map of Wales.

36:02.598 --> 36:06.894
Wales? That slag heap?
That's not worth one night's raiding.

36:07.019 --> 36:10.772
It holds the richest prize of all:
King Rhodri's daughter, Morgana.

36:10.898 --> 36:14.526
Ha! Rhodri couldn't raise enough
to ransom a Skagerrak moose.

36:14.651 --> 36:18.906
No, but Aella could.
He's to marry her in the spring.

36:19.031 --> 36:20.365
Oh?

36:21.074 --> 36:24.453
Einar, I think our Englishman
has a good idea.

36:24.912 --> 36:27.289
She's leaving soon
and must go round this point.

36:27.414 --> 36:29.958
- Here? You're sure?
- I'd stake my life on it.

36:30.083 --> 36:32.628
You already have.

36:32.794 --> 36:36.298
Let me intercept her
and bring her back here.

36:36.465 --> 36:38.926
- How many men would you need?
- One boat.

36:39.051 --> 36:40.886
- Only one boat?
- No more.

36:41.011 --> 36:45.265
What about him without the collar?
Would you take him along?

36:46.099 --> 36:49.311
Well, naturally I'd take along my slave.

36:49.436 --> 36:53.690
You stay here and draw maps.
I'll kidnap the girl.

36:58.862 --> 37:04.701
Get him to draw maps that'll guide a ship
through fog... then he'll be worth keeping.

37:04.826 --> 37:08.830
- There is no map of any use in fog.
- Then what use are you to us?

37:08.956 --> 37:13.669
Think of that while I'm gone. And don't
let anything happen to that slave.

37:23.554 --> 37:27.474
KITALA: It's a strange metal
that fell to earth from the North Star.

37:27.599 --> 37:30.269
Sandpiper brought it from far away.

37:30.394 --> 37:34.231
The price he paid
was his ears and his tongue.

37:34.606 --> 37:37.860
No matter how you hold it,
it struggles to return homeward

37:37.985 --> 37:43.031
to the star from which it fell.
It always points to the north.

37:43.156 --> 37:47.786
Not in the fog.
You cannot see the stars in the fog.

37:48.912 --> 37:50.956
Watch.

37:58.630 --> 38:02.050
Can it see the star through these walls?

38:13.896 --> 38:16.440
This could lead you to many places.

38:16.565 --> 38:21.695
Even to the land beyond
the poison sea, Valhalla.

38:21.820 --> 38:23.906
You will go there one day.

38:24.031 --> 38:27.034
Only great heroes have ever reached it.

38:30.913 --> 38:33.165
See what the runes say.

38:37.044 --> 38:39.338
Will this take me there?

38:44.468 --> 38:46.512
No.

38:47.846 --> 38:50.807
A woman will point the way.

38:55.646 --> 38:59.107
- What will she look like?
- You will know her when you see her.

38:59.233 --> 39:02.486
- When will that be?
- Soon enough.

39:03.403 --> 39:06.365
Will she love me or hate me?

39:06.490 --> 39:11.036
Love and hate are horns on the same goat.

39:12.037 --> 39:14.706
What woman would ever look at a slave?

39:14.831 --> 39:17.209
This one will.

39:23.257 --> 39:25.467
You're lying, Kitala.

39:28.554 --> 39:31.265
All your tales are lies.

40:00.335 --> 40:03.839
Don't look so sad, my lady.
It doesn't become you.

40:04.006 --> 40:06.842
Bridget, how can I marry a man
that I hate?

40:06.967 --> 40:10.345
It's not easy to be a princess,
but you have a duty.

40:10.470 --> 40:14.850
This alliance will help your people.
You must marry Aella.

40:14.975 --> 40:16.935
I would rather that I were dead.

40:17.060 --> 40:20.230
The Vikings! Turn back! It's the Vikings!

40:28.030 --> 40:29.531
Quick, my ladies, inside.

40:29.656 --> 40:33.118
Steersmen, cut to the wind!
Forecastle men forward!

40:41.752 --> 40:46.798
Remember, she's not to be harmed
or she's worthless in trade!

40:50.260 --> 40:53.222
All pull at the bowline!

41:02.105 --> 41:04.316
Bend your backs!

42:54.718 --> 42:57.179
Oh! No! No!

42:57.971 --> 43:00.098

43:00.224 --> 43:02.893
- My lady!
- No!

43:03.018 --> 43:05.854
- No! No!
- My lady... help!

43:06.563 --> 43:09.024
My lady... (SCREAMS)

43:11.026 --> 43:13.028

43:21.662 --> 43:24.581
- Bridget!
- (SCREAMS)

43:24.706 --> 43:26.750
Bridget!

43:27.876 --> 43:30.254
Welcome aboard, my lady.

43:30.379 --> 43:32.214
Aella will kill you for this.

43:32.339 --> 43:35.592
Aella? It would be a pity
to send you back to <i>him</i>.

43:35.717 --> 43:38.095
What do you know of Aella?

43:39.388 --> 43:43.141
Well, I know he'll pay all the treasure
he's got to get you back.

43:44.017 --> 43:46.687
I'll keep you for myself.

43:47.271 --> 43:50.065
By Odin, she'd make a fine Viking queen.

43:50.190 --> 43:51.191
(LAUGHTER)

43:51.358 --> 43:53.235
Get away from me!

43:53.360 --> 43:56.530
Hey, now first a little kiss of welcome.

43:56.655 --> 43:59.199
Get away!

43:59.783 --> 44:02.411
- A little kiss of welcome.
- No!

44:02.536 --> 44:04.329
Yes.

44:04.454 --> 44:05.539
(LAUGHTER)

44:05.706 --> 44:10.502
Remember, she's not to be harmed
or she'll be worthless in trade.

44:10.878 --> 44:14.882
Pretty bird, pretty feathers.
Build her a nest so she can hide.

44:16.300 --> 44:18.969
Too many hawks around here!

44:20.554 --> 44:23.473
- Make sail!
- Make sail.

44:53.587 --> 44:55.631

47:09.223 --> 47:11.266
(CHEERING)

47:22.611 --> 47:24.738
Stop rowing.

47:34.957 --> 47:37.584
Oars down!

47:38.877 --> 47:41.588
- Hail, Einar.
- Hail, Ragnar.

47:41.713 --> 47:44.508
I give thanks to Odin
for your safe return.

47:44.633 --> 47:47.553
- Well, where is she?
- Where's who?

47:47.678 --> 47:50.222
Who do you think?
Your friend with the pigtails?!

47:50.347 --> 47:54.476
Oh, stop shouting. You sound like
a moose giving birth to a hedgehog.

47:54.601 --> 47:57.312
- Einar!
- Get this grain ashore.

47:57.437 --> 48:00.274
I wanna know why you missed
the wench you were sent for.

48:00.399 --> 48:03.735
- I didn't miss her.
- Where is she?

48:11.660 --> 48:13.704
Ah...

48:13.829 --> 48:17.833
A little skinny, perhaps,
but not bad. Not bad at all.

48:17.958 --> 48:19.877
Restrain yourself, my lord.

48:20.002 --> 48:24.631
If she is dishonoured, she'll be worthless
as a queen and Aella won't ransom her.

48:24.756 --> 48:29.428
- I don't need traitors to plead my cause.
- My quarrel is with Aella, lady, not you.

48:29.553 --> 48:32.097
We agreed you would be unharmed.

48:32.264 --> 48:36.101
- Remember that, Einar. Leave her alone.
- I haven't touched her... yet.

48:36.226 --> 48:38.896
And you never will. I'd kill myself first.

48:39.479 --> 48:44.151
- Ah. She doesn't seem to like you.
- She likes me well enough.

48:44.276 --> 48:46.653
I doubt it, from the looks of her.

48:46.820 --> 48:48.947
So do I.

48:50.282 --> 48:54.119
- But the time will come.
- Never.

48:54.244 --> 48:56.288
Never?

48:57.456 --> 49:01.960
You like the scars on my face,
don't you, hm?

49:02.085 --> 49:06.798
Sure, my beauty stirs her little heart.

49:16.600 --> 49:22.231
You have better luck with falcons. She'll
never call <i>you</i> dainty-face! (LAUGHS)

49:32.157 --> 49:34.034
Any objections?

49:34.159 --> 49:36.703
Of course not, my lord. He's just a slave.

49:36.828 --> 49:40.249
- Let's go ashore and take her along.
- She stays here.

49:43.418 --> 49:48.006
We'll talk about her again,
when you're more drunk or more sober.

49:48.131 --> 49:53.971
Olaf! Anchor the boat out on the fjord.
And guard her well.

50:04.898 --> 50:05.899
(CHEERING)

50:23.417 --> 50:27.963
Ah, come. You'll soon forget the wench.

50:28.088 --> 50:31.717
- She's too skinny anyhow.
- She's beautiful.

50:31.842 --> 50:38.599
Ah, all those bones sticking out, she's an
old crow with all the feathers pulled out.

50:38.724 --> 50:41.476
She said she'd kill herself
if I touched her.

50:41.602 --> 50:46.732
They all say that. What they really mean
is they'll kill themselves if you <i>don't</i>.

50:46.899 --> 50:51.361
Maybe, but I've never had one
spit on me and bite me.

50:51.486 --> 50:56.617
Huh! They'll bite all the more
now that you're Einar One-Eye.

50:56.742 --> 51:00.787
I wanted to thank you
for proving me innocent.

51:06.126 --> 51:08.420
Go back to your husband.

51:10.047 --> 51:15.010
Come. Drink.
No one woman is worth all this fuss.

51:39.743 --> 51:43.372
Well, my lady,
as terrible as this captivity is,

51:43.497 --> 51:48.085
at least we should be thankful
that so far our honour has been spared.

51:48.210 --> 51:51.171
Yes, Bridget,
we have that to be thankful for.

51:51.296 --> 51:55.425
Strange how things never
turn out the way you expect.

51:55.551 --> 51:59.388
I always thought Vikings
attacked their women.

51:59.555 --> 52:01.390
We've been very lucky.

52:01.515 --> 52:04.309
It hasn't been due
entirely to luck, Bridget.

52:04.434 --> 52:08.355
He can't help the way he acts.
He's a pagan, my lady.

52:08.480 --> 52:11.900
- He's a mad dog.
- Well...

52:12.025 --> 52:16.280
If it weren't for the scars on his face,
he'd be rather nice looking.

52:16.405 --> 52:18.949
Oh, for a Viking, I mean.

52:19.116 --> 52:21.743
I don't want to talk about him.

52:23.620 --> 52:27.457
Scratches and bites
won't hold him off for ever.

52:43.807 --> 52:45.893
What a son!

52:49.813 --> 52:52.733
How about my mother?

52:52.858 --> 52:55.569
Tell me, did my mother fight you?

52:58.071 --> 53:01.283
Ah, did she fight me.

53:01.408 --> 53:06.163
I have the scars of her scratches
and bites all over me.

53:06.288 --> 53:09.249
Ha! What a woman.

53:11.919 --> 53:14.630
That's how I feel about Morgana.

53:16.465 --> 53:18.300
Look at me.

53:18.425 --> 53:22.763
Do you think with this face I want
the kind of wife who'd <i>let</i> me touch her?

53:22.888 --> 53:29.728
I want her to fight me tooth and nail,
the first time I take her and the last.

53:33.440 --> 53:35.651
You are my son.

53:36.693 --> 53:41.573
And you'll be wearing this one day.
Don't forget that.

53:41.740 --> 53:43.951
I won't forget it.

53:50.707 --> 53:57.840
Now... if you really want her,
as skinny as she is, I give her to you.

53:57.965 --> 54:01.009
Wait a minute. What do you mean, you...

54:01.760 --> 54:07.182
- You mean we won't ransom her?
- No! You can have her.

54:10.727 --> 54:16.275
Oh, I'll give this little wench from
Wales a reason to bite and scratch.

54:21.029 --> 54:24.241
I'm Einar!

54:24.366 --> 54:26.577
Son of Ragnar!

I'll show her what forging can be done
when fire fights fire!

54:32.583 --> 54:37.171

till they hear her in Wales!

My pretty little bird, sharpen your claws!

55:10.871 --> 55:12.915
(LAUGHS)

55:13.790 --> 55:16.168
I'm Einar!

55:20.047 --> 55:24.301
All right, men! Everybody off!

55:24.426 --> 55:27.763
Morgana and I wanna be alone.

55:27.888 --> 55:30.349
Good job, mate!

55:32.226 --> 55:34.978
Agh... Olaf!

55:36.271 --> 55:38.815
Thank you, Olaf!

55:38.941 --> 55:42.694
Morgana! Out! Out!

55:42.861 --> 55:46.782
- We don't need you.
- I can't swim!

55:54.706 --> 55:57.501
If you touch me, I'll kill myself.

55:59.336 --> 56:02.464
There's a sword to do it with...

56:02.589 --> 56:04.716
because I'm going to touch you.

56:10.013 --> 56:12.099
Scratch.

56:15.102 --> 56:17.479
Come on.

56:17.646 --> 56:20.566
- Fight!
- A woman can't fight a man.

56:20.691 --> 56:24.444
You wench! Kick, bite, scratch!

56:26.196 --> 56:28.240
Now come on.

56:29.157 --> 56:31.201
Fight me.

56:33.704 --> 56:36.165
I will not lift one finger to resist you.

56:46.091 --> 56:49.595
Whatever you do
will be on your conscience.

56:52.639 --> 56:55.934
Then let it be on my conscience.

57:05.611 --> 57:07.821
- I've come to help you escape.
- Escape?

57:07.946 --> 57:11.783
- I've stolen a ship.
- My lady, it's a tiny boat. We'll drown.

57:11.950 --> 57:13.619
- Are you afraid?
- Yes.

57:13.744 --> 57:16.288
- Will you come with me?
- Yes.

57:16.413 --> 57:19.082
My lady, how do you know
you can trust this slave?

57:19.208 --> 57:22.544
I know. If you don't want
to come, you can stay.

57:22.669 --> 57:24.963
Wait. Wait for me.

57:59.331 --> 58:02.543
Our only chance
is to get far away by morning.

58:02.668 --> 58:04.962
Yes, I can see that.

58:06.630 --> 58:09.967
We'd go a lot faster if we all rowed.

58:10.092 --> 58:12.344
Would we?

58:12.469 --> 58:15.013
Yes, we would.

58:15.138 --> 58:17.266
Do you mean that I should row this boat?

58:18.392 --> 58:20.686
Yes, I do mean that.

58:21.979 --> 58:24.189
Impossible.

58:24.314 --> 58:27.985
- Get an oar and row.
- But a princess doesn't row a boat.

58:28.110 --> 58:33.699
- Get an oar and row.
- But I can't. I don't know how.

58:38.871 --> 58:42.291
Learn. You too.

58:46.003 --> 58:47.421
Oh!

59:01.685 --> 59:06.481
- What's the matter now?
- This bodice is too tight. I'll have to stop.

59:06.607 --> 59:09.443
- What's a bodice?
- This dress I'm wearing.

59:09.568 --> 59:12.696
It's too tight right in there... Oh!

59:13.906 --> 59:17.409
- Row.
- Mine isn't too tight.

01:00:11.004 --> 01:00:13.715
Eric, look!

01:00:18.512 --> 01:00:21.765
It's Einar. Turn! Turn!

01:01:06.935 --> 01:01:11.648
- They are heading for the fog.
- We'll get them!

01:01:13.984 --> 01:01:17.446
- We can't go into the fog.
- Keep rowing.

01:02:07.496 --> 01:02:09.623
Faster! Faster!

01:02:10.165 --> 01:02:12.709
The men are afraid
we'll run aground. So am I.

01:02:12.835 --> 01:02:15.212
Keep rowing!

01:02:17.881 --> 01:02:21.051
Faster! Faster!

01:02:35.649 --> 01:02:37.568
Look out!

01:02:41.113 --> 01:02:43.365
Grab hold of the mast.

01:02:43.490 --> 01:02:45.325
Stop rowing.

01:02:46.076 --> 01:02:49.830
Odin! Odin!

01:02:51.498 --> 01:02:53.876
I'm going under!

01:02:56.044 --> 01:02:58.088
Hold on!

01:02:58.797 --> 01:03:01.049
Lift me out.

01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:00.984
Oh!

01:04:10.118 --> 01:04:12.329
Over here!

01:04:13.121 --> 01:04:14.373
Over here!

01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:18.794
EINAR: Back to your oars!

01:04:19.753 --> 01:04:22.214
- Back to your oars!
- Give up the chase.

01:04:22.339 --> 01:04:24.967
Morgana's out there! After them!

01:04:25.092 --> 01:04:30.055
The Great Snake is sunk.
You want to wreck this ship too?

01:04:30.222 --> 01:04:32.057
Ragnar.

01:04:32.182 --> 01:04:35.185
Ragnar! Ragnar!

01:04:36.812 --> 01:04:41.108
- Where's Ragnar?
- At the bottom of the fjord.

01:04:45.696 --> 01:04:49.116
The curse of Odin on that slave!

01:04:52.619 --> 01:04:57.124
If I have to cross the poison sea,
I'll find him.

01:04:57.249 --> 01:05:02.671
I swear it... by the sacred blood of Odin.

01:05:32.493 --> 01:05:34.703
Still afraid?

01:05:34.870 --> 01:05:39.583
No. I'm worth more alive
than dead. Are you?

01:05:39.708 --> 01:05:43.754
No. But I value my life much more now.

01:05:46.298 --> 01:05:52.471
Of course, I'm grateful to you for saving
me and Aella will certainly reward you...

01:05:52.596 --> 01:05:55.140
- Why should I take you back to Aella?
- But you must.

01:05:55.265 --> 01:05:57.059
Why?

01:05:57.851 --> 01:06:01.146
I'm pledged to him on my father's word.

01:06:02.022 --> 01:06:05.692
I didn't steal you away
just to give you to another man.

01:06:07.444 --> 01:06:11.198
Aella isn't another man. He's a king.

01:06:11.698 --> 01:06:13.826
And I'm a slave.

01:06:15.369 --> 01:06:18.413
And I loved you the moment I saw you.

01:06:20.123 --> 01:06:22.793
I loved you even before then.

01:06:24.419 --> 01:06:26.880
Kitala saw it in the runes.

01:06:31.677 --> 01:06:35.013
That's just Kitala's silly talk.

01:06:39.518 --> 01:06:41.770
Do you love Aella?

01:06:46.483 --> 01:06:52.030
I belong to him...
by my father's word as a Christian king.

01:06:52.865 --> 01:06:56.785
What's your father's word
compared to Odin's will?

01:06:58.996 --> 01:07:02.332
Do you know which of all the oceans
is the widest?

01:07:02.457 --> 01:07:05.127
The poison sea.

01:07:06.670 --> 01:07:08.547
No.

01:07:08.672 --> 01:07:11.758
The ocean between
a Christian and a heathen.

01:07:13.802 --> 01:07:17.389
Our hands can reach across it
as easily as that.

01:07:17.514 --> 01:07:19.808
But that's just a joining of the flesh.

01:07:20.309 --> 01:07:25.230
- What else is missing?
- The joining of our souls.

01:07:25.355 --> 01:07:28.734
If our hands are touching,
our souls must be touching.

01:07:28.859 --> 01:07:31.236
But your soul is heathen.

01:07:32.196 --> 01:07:37.409
If my soul is content to be heathen
and yours content to be Christian,

01:07:37.534 --> 01:07:41.705
let's not question flesh
for wanting to remain flesh.

01:08:04.645 --> 01:08:06.688
Kitala.

01:08:10.359 --> 01:08:12.736
We'll be in England soon.

01:08:25.624 --> 01:08:28.961
Suppose Aella releases you
from your pledge.

01:08:30.087 --> 01:08:32.798
Then I'd be free.

01:08:32.923 --> 01:08:34.966
But why should he?

01:08:35.759 --> 01:08:38.053
I'll find a way.

01:08:40.096 --> 01:08:43.015
How can I make you understand?

01:08:46.353 --> 01:08:49.731
What would be the worst thing
for a Viking?

01:08:53.234 --> 01:08:57.948
To die without a sword in his hand
and never enter Valhalla.

01:08:58.073 --> 01:09:02.327
For me to break my pledge to Aella
would be as bad as that.

01:09:22.764 --> 01:09:24.933
I'll find a way.

01:09:34.818 --> 01:09:38.572
You captured Ragnar single-handed?

01:09:39.990 --> 01:09:42.033
We all owe you our thanks.

01:09:42.158 --> 01:09:45.412
I don't want your thanks. I want Morgana.

01:09:46.830 --> 01:09:51.542
This barbarian is under the illusion you
desire to be released from your pledge.

01:09:51.667 --> 01:09:53.795
Do you release me?

01:09:53.962 --> 01:09:57.090
Surely you don't want to be released?

01:09:57.216 --> 01:09:59.468
- Yes, I do.
- That is absurd.

01:09:59.593 --> 01:10:02.137
- Sire, you gave your word.
- Of course.

01:10:02.262 --> 01:10:04.556
But first things first.

01:10:04.681 --> 01:10:08.685
Father Godwin, take the
Princess Morgana to the chapel,

01:10:08.810 --> 01:10:12.731
that she may meditate
before making a final decision.

01:10:13.941 --> 01:10:15.984
Yes, sire.

01:10:25.118 --> 01:10:29.206
Well, gentlemen,
let us proceed to the kennels.

01:10:29.331 --> 01:10:31.708
The royal pets are hungry.

01:10:31.834 --> 01:10:33.877
Take him.

01:11:08.328 --> 01:11:11.039
That stone, my lady...

01:11:14.293 --> 01:11:17.171
- Where did you get it?
- Eric gave it to me.

01:11:17.296 --> 01:11:19.131
Where did he get it?

01:11:19.256 --> 01:11:24.303
He said it was tied around his neck
when the Vikings captured him as a baby.

01:11:25.679 --> 01:11:27.723
(WOLVES BARKING)

01:12:06.887 --> 01:12:11.767
Since you brought him here,
the pleasure shall be yours.

01:12:13.018 --> 01:12:15.062
Push him in.

01:12:30.786 --> 01:12:33.831
I claim the right of a Viking
to die with a sword in my hand.

01:12:33.956 --> 01:12:36.667
And I deny you that right.

01:12:36.792 --> 01:12:40.003
Go ahead. Push him in.

01:12:42.923 --> 01:12:45.717
Cut my bonds and give me the sword.

01:12:45.843 --> 01:12:48.095
Why should I?

01:12:50.389 --> 01:12:53.100
Would you deny me
the right to enter Valhalla?

01:13:14.872 --> 01:13:17.332
What are you doing?

01:13:31.597 --> 01:13:33.932
You dare give him that sword?

01:13:47.946 --> 01:13:49.990
(YELLS)

01:13:51.074 --> 01:13:53.035
(LAUGHS)

01:13:56.788 --> 01:13:58.207
Odin!

01:13:58.332 --> 01:14:00.375
(WOLVES SNARL)

01:14:16.558 --> 01:14:18.477
And Einar is his brother.

01:14:18.602 --> 01:14:22.064
And Eric has surrendered
his own father to Aella.

01:14:22.189 --> 01:14:25.526
Oh, Father Godwin,
we must try to stop him.

01:14:25.651 --> 01:14:28.445
Yes. Come.

01:14:32.491 --> 01:14:35.536
You have dared to defy a king.

01:14:35.661 --> 01:14:38.372
You shall join Ragnar in the pit.

01:14:39.289 --> 01:14:42.167
I want all here to see the reward
for such defiance.

01:14:42.292 --> 01:14:44.962
Your Majesty,
I would ask you to bear in mind

01:14:45.087 --> 01:14:49.925
that I made good your promise
in the name of Holy Mother Church.

01:14:54.763 --> 01:15:00.602
Thank you, Father Godwin.
You are the watchdog of my fury.

01:15:01.311 --> 01:15:03.856
But if a common slave
can rob me of a queen

01:15:03.981 --> 01:15:07.234
and slay an enemy too cunning
for a whole nation to defeat,

01:15:07.359 --> 01:15:12.281
then the day must come when he will be
a deadlier foe than Ragnar ever was.

01:15:12.406 --> 01:15:16.994
With or without God's sanction,
I tell you as your king this cannot be.

01:15:17.119 --> 01:15:20.289
- Aella...
- Yes, my dear?

01:15:20.414 --> 01:15:24.585
I will keep my pledge to you.
Don't kill him.

01:15:31.717 --> 01:15:36.847
In that case, nothing could distress me
more than for you to think me cruel.

01:15:37.014 --> 01:15:39.224
Then let him go.

01:15:47.566 --> 01:15:50.110
Hold out the hand that has defied me.

01:16:09.713 --> 01:16:11.757
(GROANS)

01:16:21.934 --> 01:16:25.687
Let this serve as a lesson to all Vikings.

01:16:25.854 --> 01:16:28.857
Take him to his ship and cast him adrift.

01:16:30.859 --> 01:16:32.611
Eric!

01:16:34.863 --> 01:16:37.115
Why do we wait?

01:16:38.492 --> 01:16:43.997
Because of a slave, my father's bones
lie now at the bottom of the fjord.

01:16:45.290 --> 01:16:51.463
Ragnar was your king.
But he had no Viking's burial.

01:16:53.257 --> 01:16:58.679
I have sworn by the blood of Odin
to avenge my father's death.

01:17:02.641 --> 01:17:04.601
Why do we wait?

01:17:04.726 --> 01:17:06.895
We must mourn Ragnar.

01:17:07.396 --> 01:17:10.440
It's revenge Ragnar wants, not mourning.

01:17:10.899 --> 01:17:14.736
Every Viking wants to revenge
the death of Ragnar.

01:17:14.862 --> 01:17:17.573
Then let's go to England now
for the girl and the slave.

01:17:17.698 --> 01:17:19.825
We don't even know where they are.

01:17:19.950 --> 01:17:24.329
Where would the slave go but to Aella's
castle to be rewarded for his treachery?

01:17:24.454 --> 01:17:27.666
Perhaps, but what chance would we have?

01:17:27.791 --> 01:17:30.836
Aella's castle is the strongest
in all of England.

01:17:30.961 --> 01:17:34.256
I know Aella's castle well.
Here are the maps.

01:17:34.381 --> 01:17:36.925
Einar has studied every stone and beam.

01:17:37.050 --> 01:17:39.928
To reach the castle,
we'll have to hug the English coast.

01:17:40.053 --> 01:17:43.098
They will have days
to prepare for our attack.

01:17:45.809 --> 01:17:50.105
We don't hug the coast.
We sail across the open sea.

01:17:50.230 --> 01:17:55.027
- And if there's fog?
- Can't we do what a slave did?

01:17:55.569 --> 01:17:58.780
The slave used witchcraft.

01:17:58.906 --> 01:18:03.035
His eyes saw through the fog to the stars.

01:18:04.661 --> 01:18:06.747
Are you afraid, Bjorn?

01:18:07.247 --> 01:18:10.918
Do not confuse fear for caution.

01:18:11.084 --> 01:18:14.213
Odin has sent no sign.

01:18:15.881 --> 01:18:19.092
Then you can stay here.

01:18:19.218 --> 01:18:24.932
But we go to avenge Ragnar's death.
Who sails with me?

01:18:47.996 --> 01:18:51.291
Not even enough to man one ship.

01:19:26.952 --> 01:19:29.288
Odin.

01:19:30.998 --> 01:19:33.167
Odin.

01:19:43.010 --> 01:19:45.888
Odin must have answered me.

01:19:48.348 --> 01:19:51.727
- Where's Morgana?
- In Aella's castle.

01:19:51.852 --> 01:19:54.396
You dare to come back here
just to tell me this?

01:19:54.521 --> 01:19:57.191
No. I need you and your men
to take the castle,

01:19:57.316 --> 01:20:00.444
and you need me to guide you
across the open sea.

01:20:00.569 --> 01:20:03.030
Why should you want me to free Morgana?

01:20:03.405 --> 01:20:06.408
Because she shall be my wife.

01:20:10.704 --> 01:20:12.998
All right, slave...

01:20:14.124 --> 01:20:17.085
you live until Morgana's free.

01:20:18.587 --> 01:20:21.757
Vikings! Vikings!

01:20:21.882 --> 01:20:25.052
- Odin <i>has</i> sent us a sign.
- Kill him!

01:20:29.848 --> 01:20:32.226
Listen to me!

01:20:32.392 --> 01:20:37.814
Make no mistake, I hate this slave
more than any living man.

01:20:37.940 --> 01:20:39.983
But he can guide us to Morgana.

01:20:40.108 --> 01:20:46.615
What matters more to you, a foreign
wench or vengeance for Ragnar?

01:20:49.326 --> 01:20:54.790
Because of him, your father lies
at the bottom of the fjord.

01:20:54.915 --> 01:20:58.836
That's not true! Ragnar died in England!

01:20:58.961 --> 01:21:01.421
(MURMURING, THEN HUSH)

01:21:05.425 --> 01:21:09.263
In the fog he swam to my boat.
I took him there.

01:21:16.019 --> 01:21:18.105
How did Ragnar die?

01:21:19.648 --> 01:21:23.861
Aella ordered him bound
and thrown alive into the wolf pit.

01:21:25.737 --> 01:21:29.658
Ragnar, bound like a sheep
and thrown to wolves?

01:21:30.033 --> 01:21:32.327
I cut his bonds.

01:21:32.452 --> 01:21:35.455
He died fighting
with the sword I gave him.

01:21:35.581 --> 01:21:41.253
And this was my thanks from Aella
for letting Ragnar die like a Viking.

01:21:52.472 --> 01:21:55.017
Now you know how Ragnar died.

01:21:55.851 --> 01:21:58.228
His eyes can lead us to Aella.

01:21:58.353 --> 01:22:00.397
Now!

01:22:01.815 --> 01:22:03.901
Who sails with me?

01:22:04.026 --> 01:22:05.819
- I will!
- I will!

01:22:07.863 --> 01:22:09.531
Hail, Einar!

01:22:09.656 --> 01:22:15.746
Hail, Einar! Hail, Einar! Hail, Einar!

01:22:15.871 --> 01:22:17.915
(HORN)

01:24:27.085 --> 01:24:28.962
Strange, isn't it?

01:24:29.087 --> 01:24:33.342
I was going to take you to England
and now you're taking me.

01:24:35.052 --> 01:24:39.932
Do you still have that stone
you wear about your neck?

01:24:40.057 --> 01:24:42.434
No, it's gone.

01:24:42.559 --> 01:24:46.605
Oh. Just as well.

01:24:46.730 --> 01:24:48.774
Why?

01:24:49.441 --> 01:24:52.110
I used to think it would bring me luck.

01:24:52.236 --> 01:24:56.490
Now neither of us
will have any use for it.

01:25:19.555 --> 01:25:22.683
(HORN CALL)

01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:08.844
The Vikings!

01:30:21.482 --> 01:30:24.026
It's the Vikings!

01:30:37.664 --> 01:30:40.042
The Vikings!

01:33:54.027 --> 01:33:57.030
Egbert, where would Morgana be?

01:33:58.365 --> 01:34:01.827
The safest place is the tower chapel.

01:35:29.581 --> 01:35:31.625
Odin!

01:36:30.851 --> 01:36:33.520
(CHEERING)

01:37:44.716 --> 01:37:48.637
Be assured, sire, the second drawbridge
is much stronger than the first.

01:40:19.705 --> 01:40:22.541
(YELLS)

01:41:42.371 --> 01:41:44.414
Odin!

01:41:46.250 --> 01:41:48.085
Odin!

01:42:45.434 --> 01:42:47.478
(WOLVES GROWLING)

01:43:02.451 --> 01:43:04.203
Aella!

01:43:18.133 --> 01:43:19.551
(SCREAMS)

01:43:19.927 --> 01:43:21.803
(SHOUTING OUTSIDE)

01:44:48.891 --> 01:44:51.685
Take your magic elsewhere, holy man.

01:44:52.978 --> 01:44:55.772
This chapel is a sanctuary.

01:44:58.567 --> 01:45:00.402
Father Godwin!

01:45:26.094 --> 01:45:28.430
Go ahead, jump.

01:45:51.286 --> 01:45:53.747
You will be my queen.

01:45:57.501 --> 01:45:59.711
I knew it the first moment I saw you.

01:46:00.462 --> 01:46:05.342
You knew it too.
You knew it that night on my ship.

01:46:07.135 --> 01:46:09.972
- It's not true.
- Yes.

01:46:12.015 --> 01:46:14.059
It is true.

01:46:14.893 --> 01:46:17.146
I don't love you.

01:46:20.357 --> 01:46:23.861
You must love me exactly as I love you.

01:46:27.364 --> 01:46:30.367
I hate you! It's Eric I love.

01:46:58.228 --> 01:47:03.108
- Where are you taking me?
- To see Eric... for the last time.

01:47:03.275 --> 01:47:06.445
Don't kill him. You can't.

01:47:06.570 --> 01:47:10.073
Look at this. It's from the pommel
of the sword Requitur.

01:47:10.199 --> 01:47:13.785
It was given to Eric by his mother,
Enid the queen.

01:47:13.911 --> 01:47:17.372
Oh, listen to me! Ragnar was his father!

01:47:17.498 --> 01:47:19.791
Lies won't save him!

01:47:19.917 --> 01:47:22.711
It's true. I swear it is.

01:47:22.836 --> 01:47:25.130
He is your brother!

01:47:27.883 --> 01:47:28.884
Eric!

01:47:44.817 --> 01:47:48.403
Look at him, how he hastens to his death.

01:47:48.570 --> 01:47:50.739
He can't wait to die.

01:47:56.954 --> 01:48:01.083
If I can't have your love,
I'll take your hate.

01:48:59.558 --> 01:49:00.976
(YELLS)

01:50:44.454 --> 01:50:46.999
Why did he hesitate?

01:51:39.927 --> 01:51:41.970
Odin!

01:51:49.520 --> 01:51:52.606
Prepare a funeral for a Viking.

01:55:43.921 --> 01:55:47.174
