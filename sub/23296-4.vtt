00:06.207 --> 00:09.343
Moira: David?
My nails aren't dry yet.

00:09.377 --> 00:12.146
Alexis, I stumbled upon Ted
in the cafe this morning,

00:12.180 --> 00:13.614
he sends his regards.

00:13.647 --> 00:15.816
(Spray spritzes)

00:15.849 --> 00:18.452
- That's nice.
Um, what did he say?

00:18.486 --> 00:21.322
- Nothing, we merely exchanged
familial smiles.

00:21.355 --> 00:23.191
He seemed quite taken
with an older woman,

00:23.224 --> 00:25.259
so I thought best not
to intrude.

00:26.560 --> 00:28.562
- Love that for him.

00:28.596 --> 00:30.164
- I mean, that could've been
anyone though, right,

00:30.198 --> 00:32.366
like a mother,
or a close friend?

00:32.400 --> 00:35.436
- They were canoodling in
the banquette for all to see,

00:35.469 --> 00:38.639
so I'd be rather concerned if
that were his mother, David.

00:38.672 --> 00:40.674
- Okay.
Um, in other news,

00:40.708 --> 00:42.810
I recently discovered that
I'm allergic to pitted fruits.

00:42.843 --> 00:45.246
- Canoodling?
- Oh.

00:45.279 --> 00:48.382
- Um...did she have like a braid
in her hair?

00:49.417 --> 00:53.254
- No, no braid. Uh,
looked more like thick,

00:53.287 --> 00:56.290
healthy hair woven
together loosely.

00:56.324 --> 00:57.825
- I can't believe he's still
dating Heather.

00:57.858 --> 00:59.427
- I know, it's crazy.

00:59.460 --> 01:01.429
- I believe that was her name,
Heather.

01:01.462 --> 01:03.331
- Okay, do we have somewhere
to be?

01:03.364 --> 01:05.733
- Alexis, he doesn't still hold
any interest for you?

01:05.766 --> 01:08.102
No, it's not as if you've been
spending all your time

01:08.136 --> 01:10.404
holed up in your room, alone.

01:10.438 --> 01:13.441
- Yeah, no, I'm just like
taking time for me.

01:13.474 --> 01:14.442
- Mhmm.
- Good!

01:14.475 --> 01:16.510
That's the most important
relationship of all.

01:16.544 --> 01:17.778
Don't you give another thought
to Ted

01:17.811 --> 01:22.150
and his striking older lover.
- Okay, I am going for a jog.

01:22.183 --> 01:24.652
- Ok, um, but you're
in like a day dress.

01:24.685 --> 01:27.388
- Mhmm, I am.
(Door shuts)

01:27.421 --> 01:30.324
- Okay, I have never heard
someone say

01:30.358 --> 01:32.793
so many wrong things,
one after the other,

01:32.826 --> 01:35.829
consecutively, in a row.

01:35.863 --> 01:39.500
- David! How was I to know that
Ted would be such a trigger,

01:39.533 --> 01:41.502
all these years later?

01:41.535 --> 01:44.472
- A year later, and she is like
right back in it.

01:44.505 --> 01:46.540
So you might wanna pay
a little more attention

01:46.574 --> 01:49.643
to your daughter's life,
if only to alleviate

01:49.677 --> 01:52.613
the weight of me having
to deal with it, every day.

01:54.782 --> 01:56.717
- Oh.

01:56.750 --> 02:00.521
I... I did call that other
woman charming, didn't I?

02:00.554 --> 02:03.624
- Striking, I believe
was the word

02:03.657 --> 02:07.328
you used to describe Ted's new
girlfriend, who isn't Alexis.

02:08.429 --> 02:10.264
- Well to my credit, she was.

02:11.332 --> 02:15.536
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

02:16.970 --> 02:18.772
(Crickets chirp)

02:18.806 --> 02:19.873
(Footsteps thud)

02:19.907 --> 02:22.376
(Door opens and shuts)

02:24.278 --> 02:27.481
- Roland, you're here...early.

02:27.515 --> 02:29.950
- I've decided it's time
I become a team player.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.586
- Well, that's good!
And as coach of the team,

02:32.620 --> 02:34.555
I'm gonna ask you to take
your feet off my desk.

02:34.588 --> 02:36.824
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know, Johnny,

02:36.857 --> 02:38.292
I love all this water cooler
talk,

02:38.326 --> 02:39.660
but let's get down to business.

02:39.693 --> 02:44.298
I was lookin' around this
place, and boom, it hit me!

02:44.332 --> 02:46.534
There's a lotta wasted space
in here.

02:46.567 --> 02:47.935
I mean this should be an area
for guests to come

02:47.968 --> 02:50.504
and mix and mingle.

02:50.538 --> 02:52.240
- Well, I don't think I like
the thought of guests

02:52.273 --> 02:54.375
mingling in my office.

02:54.408 --> 02:55.943
That's what their rooms are for.

02:55.976 --> 02:58.846
- Ah, but, do the rooms
have a...

03:01.682 --> 03:03.484
(Grunts)

03:05.018 --> 03:07.355
(Grunting with effort)

03:07.388 --> 03:08.689
(Thud)

03:08.722 --> 03:09.890
- (Pants)

03:09.923 --> 03:12.226
...beer fridge?

03:12.260 --> 03:13.461
- Where did this come from?

03:13.494 --> 03:14.562
- I brought it over
this morning.

03:14.595 --> 03:16.930
Joce wanted a little extra
space for the new baby,

03:16.964 --> 03:19.900
and I thought why not help out
a buddy in the process?

03:19.933 --> 03:21.735
- And how's this helping me?

03:21.769 --> 03:24.605
- Well, you can sell beers
to the guests, Johnny,

03:24.638 --> 03:26.674
unless of course you're trying
not to make money,

03:26.707 --> 03:29.577
which would explain a couple
of things here.

03:29.610 --> 03:30.544
- Well of course I'm tryin'
to make money.

03:30.578 --> 03:32.780
- Johnny, if it makes any
difference to you,

03:32.813 --> 03:35.449
I've already sold 2 beers
to a fellow staff member.

03:35.483 --> 03:37.485
- Would that staff member
be you?

03:37.518 --> 03:39.587
- Yes, it would.
I'm gonna have 'em after lunch.

03:39.620 --> 03:42.423
Now the big question is
where to put the TV?

03:42.456 --> 03:44.758
- What TV?
- Well, Johnny,

03:44.792 --> 03:46.794
you can't expect guests to sit
around with their beers

03:46.827 --> 03:49.263
staring at you. (Laughs)

03:50.398 --> 03:51.899
Oh God...you knock me out, kid.

03:51.932 --> 03:54.735
- Okay, you know what, your job
here is not CEO, Roland,

03:54.768 --> 03:57.405
you were hired to do some
work around the motel.

03:57.438 --> 03:59.640
So I'm gonna say no to the TV.

03:59.673 --> 04:02.976
- Okay, Johnny, I hear ya loud
and clear. Geez.

04:04.712 --> 04:06.480
(Can opens, slurps)

04:07.848 --> 04:09.783
Off to work.

04:09.817 --> 04:12.786
(Door opens and shuts)

04:12.820 --> 04:15.823
Patrick: I cursed those bears
with the little strength

04:15.856 --> 04:18.326
that I could muster up.
(Stevie laughs)

04:18.359 --> 04:19.793
- Hi!

04:19.827 --> 04:22.430
We're all just hanging out
before work?

04:22.463 --> 04:24.365
Was there a text chain
that I wasn't on, or...?

04:24.398 --> 04:26.400
- Well, it's not exactly
before work

04:26.434 --> 04:27.801
the store opened about
25 minutes ago, so.

04:27.835 --> 04:30.971
- But yes, there is a chain,
and no, you're not on it.

04:31.004 --> 04:33.441
- You're kind. I noticed
we moved the lip balms.

04:33.474 --> 04:35.576
- Yeah, because we got these
new breath mints in

04:35.609 --> 04:37.511
and I wanted to give 'em
a fighting chance

04:37.545 --> 04:38.646
by putting 'em up near
the cash.

04:38.679 --> 04:39.279
- Huh.
- Uh oh.

04:41.081 --> 04:43.617
- What, is something wrong?

04:43.651 --> 04:46.887
- No, they're just new mints
that haven't been sampled yet,

04:46.920 --> 04:48.989
so for all we know,
they could be poison,

04:49.022 --> 04:51.024
and we're moving the lip balms,
best sellers,

04:51.058 --> 04:52.826
all the way to the corner, here.

04:52.860 --> 04:54.995
- Okay, well I don't think that
the mints are poison.

04:55.028 --> 04:56.597
- They're very delicious.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.699
Point is, these are a staple
of the store.

04:58.732 --> 05:00.534
They're at the cash,
people come to the cash

05:00.568 --> 05:02.603
expecting the lip balm.
- Mhmm.

05:02.636 --> 05:05.473
- I just wish they had been
consulted before they were
moved.

05:05.506 --> 05:06.907
- David you move things without
consulting me all the time.

05:06.940 --> 05:08.642
Like the brooms!

05:08.676 --> 05:10.744
- Okay, well they were fugly
brooms with big red handles.

05:10.778 --> 05:13.614
They didn't match our sand
and stone colour palette.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.783
- Well, this is clearly
a high-stakes situation,

05:15.816 --> 05:19.086
so maybe you wanna close the
store down and figure it out.

05:19.119 --> 05:20.921
- You know, David, one of the
fundamental pillars

05:20.954 --> 05:22.423
of any successful business
person

05:22.456 --> 05:24.758
is their ability to compromise.

05:24.792 --> 05:27.661
- Hm, I have to agree
with Patrick on this one.

05:27.695 --> 05:29.963
- I don't think there's
anything you have to do,

05:29.997 --> 05:32.566
and I compromise all the time.

05:33.501 --> 05:34.535
- (Laughs)

05:37.137 --> 05:39.039
- What?
- Nothing, I just um,

05:40.173 --> 05:42.543
just remembering all those
times that you compromised.

05:42.576 --> 05:44.111
- (Laughs) I was just thinking
about the same things,

05:44.144 --> 05:46.680
because there, there's
so many to flip through.

05:46.714 --> 05:49.650
- Okay, last week, I let you
pick the movie we watched.

05:49.683 --> 05:52.119
- You made me pick between
two Sandra Bullock vehicles.

05:52.152 --> 05:53.887
- And you picked
"The Lake House",

05:53.921 --> 05:56.424
which was the correct choice.
- Just so that you know,

05:56.457 --> 05:58.426
making someone choose between
two things that you like,

05:58.459 --> 05:59.960
is not exactly a compromise.

05:59.993 --> 06:02.563
- I am fine with compromise.

06:02.596 --> 06:05.766
It's just this situation
that's bothering me.

06:05.799 --> 06:08.502
So why don't we just put
everything back exactly

06:08.536 --> 06:11.572
as it was, and start again?
- So in that case,

06:11.605 --> 06:13.073
I know that you were planning
to go pick up

06:13.106 --> 06:14.942
the tote bags later this
afternoon,

06:14.975 --> 06:17.044
even though I'd asked you do
to that 2 days ago,

06:17.077 --> 06:18.746
so maybe in the interest
of compromise,

06:18.779 --> 06:20.814
you could go and do that...now?

06:23.517 --> 06:25.686
- Fine.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.488
Stevie, would you care
to join me?

06:27.521 --> 06:29.089
- No.
- Fair enough.

06:29.122 --> 06:30.891
So you guys are just gonna
stay behind

06:30.924 --> 06:32.660
and talk about me
after I've left.

06:32.693 --> 06:35.629
You know, swap stories
about how I don't compromise.

06:35.663 --> 06:38.432
- Yeah, pretty much.
- Mhmm.

06:38.466 --> 06:39.900
(Door shuts)

06:39.933 --> 06:41.435
Twyla: Here's your tea,
Mrs. Rose.

06:41.469 --> 06:43.003
- Thank you, Twyla.

06:43.036 --> 06:46.139
So, it looks like I will
be seeing you tonight.

06:46.173 --> 06:48.175
- Why would that happen?

06:48.208 --> 06:49.810
- Well, Alexis came by this
morning

06:49.843 --> 06:53.046
and was really adamant
that we go out tonight.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.949
Apparently I've been taking
too much time for myself,

06:55.983 --> 06:58.051
and I need to get back out
there and meet people.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.853
- Is that so?

06:59.887 --> 07:02.690
- Yeah, I actually had plans
tonight,

07:02.723 --> 07:04.858
but Alexis said it would be
best if I just cancelled them.

07:04.892 --> 07:06.760
She's gonna help me get ready
at the motel,

07:06.794 --> 07:09.196
and then we're gonna go
to the bar together.

07:09.229 --> 07:11.465
- Always the little
philanthrope.

07:11.499 --> 07:13.701
Though it's possible
this outing

07:13.734 --> 07:15.469
might serve you both well.

07:17.037 --> 07:19.072
I'm sure you're not aware
of this but,

07:19.106 --> 07:22.710
our Alexis is unfortunately
suffering a bit of a dry spell.

07:25.078 --> 07:30.584
Exacerbated by this situation
with the former lover, Ted,

07:30.618 --> 07:33.887
and his new girlfriend,
Harriet?

07:33.921 --> 07:35.923
- You mean Heather?
- I believe it's Heather.

07:35.956 --> 07:39.092
- Yeah, um, Ted and Heather
have been together for...

07:39.126 --> 07:42.195
hm, a while now.

07:42.229 --> 07:44.231
They started dating when Alexis
was still working

07:44.264 --> 07:46.266
at the vet's office.

07:46.299 --> 07:49.670
She says it doesn't bother her,
but sometimes I wonder.

07:49.703 --> 07:52.640
- Always the closed book,
our Alexis. Bless her soul.

07:52.673 --> 07:54.875
- I've always found her to be
pretty open about things.

07:54.908 --> 07:57.210
- A closed book that falls open

07:57.244 --> 07:59.079
the second you take it off
the shelf.

08:01.181 --> 08:03.651
That's enough gossip for today,
Twyla.

08:03.684 --> 08:07.120
No, I'm not comfortable
discussing the intimate details

08:07.154 --> 08:09.790
of Alexis' private life,
with her not present.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.659
- Oh, I wasn't gossiping,

08:11.692 --> 08:13.126
it was just that you brought
it up.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.128
So I just wanted to clarify
that it was--

08:15.162 --> 08:17.264
- Gossip is the devil's
telephone.

08:17.297 --> 08:19.700
Best to just hang up.

08:19.733 --> 08:21.902
(Awkward silence)

08:21.935 --> 08:23.203
(Patrons chatter,
music plays on the radio)

08:25.706 --> 08:27.675
(Door opens)

08:27.708 --> 08:29.242
(Clip of "Erin Brockovich"
on TV)

08:29.276 --> 08:30.978
Erin: I left messages.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.880
Ed: You did,
well I didn't know that.

08:32.913 --> 08:35.182
Uh, Donald seems to think
that you said--

08:35.215 --> 08:36.550
- What's going on?

08:36.584 --> 08:39.286
- (Roland sighs)

08:39.319 --> 08:41.722
Well, Erin Brockovich

08:41.755 --> 08:43.323
has just started her job
at the law firm,

08:43.356 --> 08:45.158
and she's not getting
the respect she deserves,

08:45.192 --> 08:47.595
because of the way she dresses.
- Not the movie!

08:47.628 --> 08:49.897
This!

08:49.930 --> 08:51.865
- Oh, well I'm just showing

08:51.899 --> 08:53.567
a couple of our guests
the set up.

08:53.601 --> 08:56.837
Turns out, Carmine, here,
is a big Albert Finney fan.

08:56.870 --> 08:59.239
- Roland, can I have a word?

09:01.274 --> 09:04.311
- Keep it on pause, boys.
(Sighs)

09:06.313 --> 09:09.583
Yeah, okay,
I know what you're gonna say.

09:09.617 --> 09:11.585
Better than expected, huh?

09:11.619 --> 09:14.021
- I specifically said no TV.

09:14.054 --> 09:16.123
- Johnny, I thought you were
joking.

09:16.156 --> 09:18.158
- Why would you think
I was joking?

09:18.191 --> 09:20.193
- I dunno, maybe it's your dry
wit, you know,

09:20.227 --> 09:22.029
that never quite hits
the target.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.164
- You're gonna have to say
goodbye to Carmine

09:24.197 --> 09:25.599
and his friend.

09:25.633 --> 09:27.968
- It's his brother, Brian.

09:28.001 --> 09:29.803
Although they could be friends
too, I don't know,

09:29.837 --> 09:31.271
they could be brothers
and friends.

09:31.304 --> 09:33.340
Guys, how would you describe
your relationship?

09:33.373 --> 09:35.208
- Roland?
- Friendly?

09:35.242 --> 09:38.378
- You're supposed to be weeding
the back lawn today!

09:38.411 --> 09:41.649
- Okay, but for the sake
of customer service,

09:41.682 --> 09:43.283
try to chill out, my man.

09:43.316 --> 09:46.153
- I will chill out when
the back lawn gets weeded!

09:46.186 --> 09:47.821
- Oh fine.

09:47.855 --> 09:50.691
Fellas, finish it without me,
sorry.

09:50.724 --> 09:52.693
(Erin Brockovich plays again)

09:52.726 --> 09:54.628
(Door opens and shuts)

09:54.662 --> 09:56.196
Erin: I trusted you.

09:56.229 --> 09:57.364
Ed: Sorry about that,
I really am.

09:57.397 --> 09:59.667
Erin: I don't need pity,
I need a paycheque.

09:59.700 --> 10:02.135
And I've looked, but when
you spent the past 6 years

10:02.169 --> 10:03.904
raising babies,
it's really hard--

10:03.937 --> 10:06.173
- Has she broken up
with the boyfriend yet?

10:06.206 --> 10:07.808
Erin: ...are you gettin' every
word of this down, honey?

10:07.841 --> 10:09.910
Or am I talkin' too fast
for you?

10:10.911 --> 10:12.680
(Soft Jazz music plays)

10:12.713 --> 10:14.815
(Bell dings)
- Hi.

10:14.848 --> 10:17.317
(Soft Jazz music plays)

10:17.350 --> 10:19.653
Hi.

10:19.687 --> 10:21.822
(Soft Jazz music plays)

10:26.126 --> 10:28.195
Notice some of our more
discreet backroom items

10:28.228 --> 10:30.263
are now on display
at the front of the store.

10:30.297 --> 10:31.932
That would have nothing
to do with the conversation

10:31.965 --> 10:34.134
we just had before I left,
would it?

10:34.167 --> 10:36.103
- Oh, well people have been
asking for plungers,

10:36.136 --> 10:38.939
and uh, you insist on keeping
them hidden away

10:38.972 --> 10:40.407
in the back room because
you find them offensive.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.275
- Hmm.
- So, uh,

10:42.309 --> 10:44.444
I thought given the demand
for some more basic items,

10:44.477 --> 10:46.780
this could be a good
opportunity for you to...

10:46.814 --> 10:48.348
make a compromise.

10:50.050 --> 10:51.952
- Okay, I mean if assaulting
customers

10:51.985 --> 10:53.887
with the sight of a toilet
plunger

10:53.921 --> 10:55.388
the minute they walk
in the door

10:55.422 --> 10:57.090
is something that you consider
to be

10:57.124 --> 11:00.227
an effective business strategy,

11:00.260 --> 11:04.197
then that is a compromise
that I am willing to make.

11:06.299 --> 11:07.868
- Are you sure?

11:09.002 --> 11:10.871
- Look at his face.
- Look at your face.

11:10.904 --> 11:12.239
Yes, yes.

11:12.272 --> 11:13.440
- Okay, great.

11:13.473 --> 11:17.144
if I get the toilet brushes
out here, too.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.813
(Soft Jazz music plays)

11:19.847 --> 11:21.348
- Is something wrong, David?

11:23.851 --> 11:25.285
- No.

11:27.220 --> 11:30.290
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

11:30.323 --> 11:31.391
(Crickets chirp)

11:34.061 --> 11:36.797
- You do this every night
you go out?

11:36.830 --> 11:38.932
- I do this every night.

11:38.966 --> 11:41.168
- Well, look at the two of you.

11:41.201 --> 11:44.772
Oh you remind me of my days
at the old Mudd Club

11:44.805 --> 11:46.306
on the Lower East Side.

11:47.507 --> 11:50.510
I remember one regrettably
early morning

11:50.543 --> 11:52.045
with Johnny Thunders.

11:52.079 --> 11:53.781
- Okay, can we help you with
something?

11:53.814 --> 11:55.983
- Oh, I'm sorry, can't a mother
show a little interest

11:56.016 --> 11:58.285
in her only daughter's social
calendar?

11:58.318 --> 12:02.322
So, what establishment are
we going to grace tonight?

12:02.355 --> 12:04.224
- It's just a bar
on the outside of town.

12:04.257 --> 12:06.426
- And how are we getting
around?

12:06.459 --> 12:08.495
They don't allow you
to drink and drive anymore.

12:08.528 --> 12:10.864
- We will be taking a cab.

12:10.898 --> 12:13.333
- No you won't!
I will drive you!

12:13.366 --> 12:15.836
Oh dear, I have the night
to myself,

12:15.869 --> 12:17.237
and I would like nothing better

12:17.270 --> 12:19.239
than to find a new man
for Twyla.

12:21.308 --> 12:24.978
I see before me, a beautiful
young woman in her prime,

12:25.012 --> 12:26.947
who deserves every happiness.

12:29.983 --> 12:33.420
- Mrs. Rose, that's the nicest
thing anyone's ever said to me.

12:35.823 --> 12:37.457
- And I mean every word of it.

12:37.490 --> 12:40.127
So I think you girls should
allow me to play chauffeur

12:40.160 --> 12:42.796
for the evening. It'll be
the black car out front.

12:42.830 --> 12:44.965
- Okay, I know what our car
looks like, but thank you.

12:49.169 --> 12:51.872
(Motorcycle engine revs)

12:51.905 --> 12:54.141
(Car rumbles up)

12:54.174 --> 12:56.076
(Muffled music and chatter)

12:58.211 --> 12:59.579
- Oh.

12:59.612 --> 13:02.249
- Before you go in,

13:02.282 --> 13:05.152
a bit of advice from someone
who's been around.

13:05.185 --> 13:07.287
- Okay, pretty sure we didn't
ask you, but sure.

13:07.320 --> 13:10.924
- If, and when, you meet
someone who catches your eye,

13:10.958 --> 13:13.193
hold his gaze.

13:13.226 --> 13:16.196
- Then walk up behind him,

13:16.229 --> 13:19.466
trace a single finger
down his back.

13:19.499 --> 13:22.535
And if he follows you into
a dark corner of the bar,

13:22.569 --> 13:24.972
it's meant to be.

13:25.005 --> 13:27.107
- Hm, that sounds super
embarrassing.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.876
- It was my go-to move many
years ago,

13:28.909 --> 13:31.078
and it always paid off.

13:31.111 --> 13:32.980
And do you know
who my last target was?

13:33.013 --> 13:34.414
- Who was it?
- Ooh.

13:34.447 --> 13:36.583
- John Cougar...

13:36.616 --> 13:38.418
- No.
- ...Mellencamp.

13:38.451 --> 13:40.187
- (Laughs)

13:40.220 --> 13:41.955
- But guess who drove me home
that night?

13:41.989 --> 13:44.291
- Mr. Rose.
- Yes, you're right.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.459
- And that car ride was better

13:46.493 --> 13:49.396
than any dark corner dalliance
with JCM.

13:49.429 --> 13:51.331
- Ew.

13:51.364 --> 13:55.602
- Sometimes in life and in love
risks must be taken.

13:55.635 --> 13:58.005
One never knows what may happen.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.408
Okay? Shall I wait here
for you both?

14:01.441 --> 14:03.343
- Um, we're not in high school,
so I think we're good,

14:03.376 --> 14:04.912
but thank you.
- Okay.

14:04.945 --> 14:06.146
(Door unlocks)

14:06.179 --> 14:08.048
- Thanks for the ride,
Mrs. Rose.

14:08.081 --> 14:10.483
- (Alexis grunts)
Okay, thanks!

14:12.085 --> 14:15.155
- Alexis! You're wrinkled
in the back.

14:15.188 --> 14:18.358
- Ooh? What?
- Confidence, girls!

14:18.391 --> 14:20.193
(Car door shuts)

14:22.963 --> 14:25.498
(Roland shouts and laughs)

14:25.532 --> 14:27.167
(Crickets chirp)

14:28.535 --> 14:31.304
(Door opens and shuts)

14:31.338 --> 14:35.342
(Low music plays from the game,
controller clicks)

14:35.375 --> 14:37.110
- Roland!

14:39.612 --> 14:42.282
Take 'em off!

14:42.315 --> 14:44.417
- You're taking off? All right,
have a good night, Johnny.

14:44.451 --> 14:46.319
- What're you still doing here?

14:46.353 --> 14:48.688
- Well, I'm just kicking back a
little bit. It was a busy day.

14:48.721 --> 14:51.458
- Roland! You have a pregnant
wife at home,

14:51.491 --> 14:54.094
it's 9:00 at night, you're here
playing video games?

14:54.127 --> 14:55.562
What are you, hiding out?

14:55.595 --> 14:57.430
- No, I'm not hiding out,
Johnny.

14:57.464 --> 14:59.432
(Door opens)
- Good evening, gentlemen.

14:59.466 --> 15:01.101
- Jocelyn.

15:01.134 --> 15:02.702
- Roland, I brought you ribs
for dinner.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.671
- Oh thank you, honey.

15:04.704 --> 15:07.975
- So, he seems to be making
himself comfortable here.

15:08.008 --> 15:10.377
- Yes, a little...
little too comfortable.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.345
Jocelyn, I don't wanna start
anything here,

15:12.379 --> 15:14.547
but Roland did finish work
a few hours ago,

15:14.581 --> 15:18.718
and I was telling him that
he should be... heading home?

15:18.751 --> 15:20.387
- Here's the thing.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.689
I have just remembered
how attentive Roland gets

15:22.722 --> 15:27.194
when I am pregnant. He is very
hands on, very concerned,

15:27.227 --> 15:29.696
and he is just always... there.

15:31.731 --> 15:35.402
So we were thinking that it
might better, for me,

15:35.435 --> 15:38.071
if we could just kind of extend
his work day, you know,

15:38.105 --> 15:40.407
to allow for some more
alone time.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.209
For me.

15:42.242 --> 15:44.411
- Okay. I understand.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.246
- Oh! (Laughs)

15:46.279 --> 15:49.382
Wow! I just upgraded my wand!

15:49.416 --> 15:51.718
Two more levels and I'll have
enough opals to buy the harp.

15:51.751 --> 15:53.253
- Way to go, honey!

15:54.387 --> 15:59.026
Alone time, Johnny.
I just need some alone time.

16:00.027 --> 16:01.461
(Slow music plays)

16:04.531 --> 16:08.001
- So, I don't think I'm gonna
need a ride home tonight.

16:08.035 --> 16:10.337
- Oh my God, that's so great!

16:10.370 --> 16:12.172
- Because I think I'm going
home with a guy.

16:12.205 --> 16:14.307
- No, yeah, I pieced
that together.

16:14.341 --> 16:16.776
- He plays soccer,
and he works at the quarry,

16:16.809 --> 16:19.279
and we both have the same
second favourite colour.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.314
- So important.

16:21.348 --> 16:23.350
Your mom's trick totally worked.

16:23.383 --> 16:25.452
I ran my finger down the backs
of three different guys,

16:25.485 --> 16:27.354
and one of them turned around.

16:27.387 --> 16:30.323
It's a total numbers game.
You're gonna be okay?

16:30.357 --> 16:33.293
- Yeah, yeah, for sure.
Of course.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.528
- I'm just so glad I took
a risk.

16:35.562 --> 16:37.330
Speaking of which...

16:38.531 --> 16:40.500
the guy over there,

16:40.533 --> 16:42.302
he's been staring at you
all night.

16:42.335 --> 16:52.379
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

16:52.379 --> 16:59.686
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

16:59.719 --> 17:01.221
(Door creaks shut)

17:03.156 --> 17:04.724
(Footstep crunch)

17:04.757 --> 17:06.226
(Muffled music plays)

17:07.594 --> 17:09.762
(Door creaks shut)

17:11.298 --> 17:12.699
- (Clears her throat)

17:14.301 --> 17:16.569
Ted: Hello?
- Hey.

17:16.603 --> 17:19.439
- Hello?
- Hey, can you hear me?

17:19.472 --> 17:21.774
- Just joking,
you've got Ted's voicemail.

17:21.808 --> 17:23.576
Don't you hate it when people
do that?

17:23.610 --> 17:25.812
Me too, and yet I just did it.

17:25.845 --> 17:29.216
Anyway, leave a message and
I'll call you back. (Beep)

17:29.249 --> 17:30.650
(Muffled music plays)

17:34.754 --> 17:37.157
Patrick: You know,
I have to say,

17:37.190 --> 17:39.192
if we hadn't put these babies
out there,

17:39.226 --> 17:40.793
there's a strong possibility

17:40.827 --> 17:42.495
we wouldn't have sold two
of 'em today.

17:42.529 --> 17:44.597
- And a brush.

17:44.631 --> 17:47.367
- But at what cost? You know?

17:47.400 --> 17:49.469
- And the mark-up on the
plungers is actually very good.

17:49.502 --> 17:50.637
- Hmm.

17:50.670 --> 17:52.605
Makes me think that we should
be taking more products

17:52.639 --> 17:55.642
from the back and actually
putting them out here.

17:55.675 --> 17:57.644
- Mhmm.

17:59.812 --> 18:02.315
Okay, no, no, no, no, no.

18:02.349 --> 18:04.217
No! no!

18:04.251 --> 18:07.354
Fine, I'm terrible at
compromise! There, I said it.

18:07.387 --> 18:10.590
Like Beyonce,
I excel as a solo artist,

18:10.623 --> 18:13.860
and I was also dressed by my
mother well into my teens,

18:13.893 --> 18:16.263
okay?
- Let it out David, let it out.

18:16.296 --> 18:18.431
- I'm sorry that I just know
what looks correct.

18:18.465 --> 18:22.435
And this situation
is not correct!

18:22.469 --> 18:24.871
Toilet plungers on display
at the front of a store,

18:24.904 --> 18:27.240
is incorrect!

18:27.274 --> 18:30.843
Breath mints where the lip
balms should be. Not correct!

18:30.877 --> 18:32.779
- Not correct.

18:32.812 --> 18:35.715
- These mountaineering shoes
that my boyfriend is wearing,

18:35.748 --> 18:38.185
looking like Oprah on a
Thanksgiving Day hike,

18:38.218 --> 18:40.153
incorrect.

18:40.187 --> 18:42.289
- I'm sorry,
what did you just say?

18:42.322 --> 18:45.392
- I said the breath mints
need to move.

18:45.425 --> 18:48.595
- I think it was something
about your boyfriend's shoes?

18:48.628 --> 18:51.231
- Um... I don't remember
saying that.

18:51.264 --> 18:52.765
- Yeah, no,
that's what I heard.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.701
- Well hey, my boyfriend
doesn't like the shoes,

18:54.734 --> 18:56.503
I could, I could take
the shoes off.

18:56.536 --> 18:58.605
- I mean, or not.
I don't remember saying it.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.673
So, you can do whatever
you'd like.

19:02.242 --> 19:04.211
- I think my work here is done.

19:04.244 --> 19:06.646
- And what work is that,
exactly?

19:06.679 --> 19:09.382
(Patrick chuckles)

19:09.416 --> 19:12.352
(Door opens, bell jingles)

19:12.885 --> 19:14.621
- My boyfriend doesn't
like the shoes,

19:14.654 --> 19:16.223
so I'm gonna take the shoes off.

19:16.256 --> 19:17.957
- Okay, before you do that,

19:17.990 --> 19:21.194
I just wanna let you know that
sock feet in a public place

19:21.228 --> 19:22.862
is also incorrect.

19:23.663 --> 19:27.500
- We do what we have to do.

19:30.237 --> 19:31.671
(Muffled music plays)

19:33.273 --> 19:34.541
- (Moira gasps)

19:34.574 --> 19:37.410
Hello, you!

19:37.444 --> 19:41.281
- Hey. You were in the bar?
How did I not see you?

19:42.449 --> 19:47.387
I... I wanted to wait for you,
but I got bored in the car.

19:47.420 --> 19:50.423
Bored, so I found a lovely
little speakeasy

19:50.457 --> 19:52.592
at the back of the club.

19:53.993 --> 19:55.762
Where's Twyla?

19:55.795 --> 19:59.432
- Oh, she used your little...
finger trick.

19:59.466 --> 20:03.403
- Oh! So I guess we won't
be waiting for her!

20:03.436 --> 20:05.738
- Guess we won't.
- No.

20:05.772 --> 20:07.840
Are you goin' back in?

20:07.874 --> 20:11.744
- No. There's no one in there
for me.

20:15.648 --> 20:18.418
- Okay. (Footsteps crunch)

20:18.451 --> 20:20.420
Well, I...

20:20.453 --> 20:23.790
I didn't want to say this
in front of Twyla but...

20:23.823 --> 20:27.827
there was a reason I drew
Mr. Cougar Mellencamp

20:27.860 --> 20:31.331
into that dark corner of the
bar instead of your father.

20:31.364 --> 20:33.933
- I don't need to know
how this story ends, so...

20:33.966 --> 20:36.936
- Your father was with someone
at the time.

20:38.838 --> 20:42.342
But I knew there was something
between us. I just knew it.

20:43.776 --> 20:47.714
Whatever it was,
it was worth waiting for.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.584
- Well, that's very cute
for you,

20:51.618 --> 20:53.620
but I don't know what
that has to do with me.

20:53.653 --> 20:55.888
- It took a year.

20:55.922 --> 20:57.957
- A year?

20:57.990 --> 21:00.727
- But if it's meant to be,
they'll come around!

21:02.829 --> 21:05.264
- (Laughs) Mhmm.

21:06.933 --> 21:10.470
- Should we call it a night?
- Yes.

21:10.503 --> 21:12.705
- I think so, too.

21:14.741 --> 21:16.909
(Footsteps crunch,
keys jingle)

21:20.012 --> 21:22.415
- I'm driving?
- That's a good idea!
