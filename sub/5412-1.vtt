01:21.331 --> 01:23.332
<i>You know, keep her straight... Keep her level.</i>

01:23.333 --> 01:25.751
<i>It's your first time up, so
don't do anything interesting.</i>

01:25.752 --> 01:27.595
- Who me?
- Yeah, you.

01:27.596 --> 01:29.805
Remember, she stalls out at about 100.

01:29.806 --> 01:33.667
So, keep the air speed up, otherwise
you'll be drifting all over the skies.

01:33.668 --> 01:37.587
- If the ailerons start to shimmy...
- Peevy, I've flown a plane or two in my life.

01:37.588 --> 01:40.649
Not like this one, you have.
This one's a handful.

01:40.650 --> 01:44.447
You sneeze in this thing and you'll
end up upside down in a bean field.

01:45.863 --> 01:48.966
- That's fresh paint, damn it!
- Do you want me to crash?

01:48.967 --> 01:52.206
Chewing gum ain't gonna
keep your butt in the air.

01:56.024 --> 02:00.422
Treat her nice, Clifford. She's gonna
take us all the way to the nationals.

02:02.179 --> 02:04.710
- Let's make some history.
- Yeah.

02:08.176 --> 02:10.598
Crank her up, Goose!

02:14.266 --> 02:17.489
- Make her hot!
- <i>Hot and brakes.</i>

04:11.751 --> 04:14.381
Hey, watch this, Peevy!

04:26.391 --> 04:29.496
National air race is our next stop, Peevy!

04:56.153 --> 04:58.663
You tryin' to save ammo? Nail 'em!

04:58.664 --> 05:02.220
I can't get a clean shot. Wish that
black-and-white would get out of the way.

05:10.842 --> 05:12.823
Careful what you wish for.

05:52.942 --> 05:55.595
This is the 3rd car in a month.
Hoover'll be spittin' nails.

05:55.596 --> 05:57.284
The heck with Hoover!

06:13.456 --> 06:16.991
- There he is. Outta my way. I can't see.
- Keep drivin'!

06:17.692 --> 06:21.633
- Quit movin'. You're ruining my shot!
- Get back. Get...

06:38.030 --> 06:41.027
Let's go, Lenny. We can't get caught with...

06:43.167 --> 06:44.997
Lousy feds!

06:54.662 --> 06:56.192
Somethin' ain't right.

07:03.363 --> 07:04.884
Sorry, Lenny.

07:20.230 --> 07:21.734
He's gettin' away.

07:44.721 --> 07:45.705
Get it off!

07:45.706 --> 07:48.467
- Get him out! Get him out!
- Peevy!

07:48.468 --> 07:51.344
Hit the latch! Hurry!

07:51.945 --> 07:54.639
Get the hell outta there!

07:55.040 --> 07:57.562
Where you goin'? Cliff!

07:59.553 --> 08:01.858
You all right? You okay?

08:09.280 --> 08:12.494
Well... that's the end of that!

08:13.984 --> 08:17.529
- All right, get it outta here.
- Wait a minute, here.

08:17.530 --> 08:22.334
You chase crooks across our runway,
crash into my pilot, and it's our fault?

08:22.335 --> 08:25.870
No offence, pops, but we got
more important things to do...

08:25.871 --> 08:27.589
than get all sweaty about whose fault it was.

08:27.590 --> 08:31.243
Listen, buddy, building that plane took 3 years
of our lives and every damn cent we had.

08:31.244 --> 08:33.720
Go, file a claim with Uncle
Sam. You could get lucky.

08:33.721 --> 08:38.183
And what, wait six months... a year?
We... we made a livin' with that plane.

08:38.183 --> 08:41.272
Well maybe it's time to get a real job.

08:43.105 --> 08:47.359
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Relax! Relax! Relax!

08:47.360 --> 08:51.079
You got that one free, kid. One more and
you'll be eatin' soft food for a month!

08:51.080 --> 08:52.197
- Yeah?
- <i>Take it easy!</i>

08:52.198 --> 08:54.366
- <i>Come on, let's go.</i>
- Relax.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.635
That fly boy hangs one on my
kisser and you let him waltz?

08:56.636 --> 08:58.916
Maybe you had it comin'.

09:02.074 --> 09:05.338
- We need a word with the patient.
- In private.

09:08.530 --> 09:11.249
Your buddy's getting fitted for a pine overcoat.

09:11.250 --> 09:16.054
If you make it to County General,
Alcatraz is your new digs.

09:16.055 --> 09:18.931
Spit it out, Wilmer. Where's the package?

09:19.232 --> 09:21.885
Blown to hell.

09:22.386 --> 09:24.854
Why don't you go look for it?

09:25.655 --> 09:29.362
- Get him outta here.
- Hey, Fitch?

09:32.980 --> 09:35.302
Take a look at this.

09:37.535 --> 09:42.381
- That must be the gizmo, all right.
- Okay, button it up.

09:42.582 --> 09:46.251
- Call 'im, Wooly.
- Why me? I called last time.

09:46.252 --> 09:48.124
But he likes you.

09:52.750 --> 09:54.301
<i>There's no mistake about that, Wooly?</i>

09:54.302 --> 09:58.397
- <i>I'm afraid not. We got what's left of it.
- I see.                           - I'm sorry.</i>

09:58.598 --> 10:01.483
- <i>It was damn sloppy.
- It could've been worse. We got the gizmo.</i>

10:01.484 --> 10:04.962
- Well, yes, it could been worse.
- <i>We'll take it down to headquarters.</i>

10:04.962 --> 10:05.779
Right.

10:06.780 --> 10:08.949
<i>Was that Wolinski?</i>

10:10.350 --> 10:12.986
They chased it to an airstrip in the valley.

10:12.987 --> 10:15.589
There was a wreck on the runway.

10:15.990 --> 10:18.708
The X-3 was destroyed.

10:19.609 --> 10:24.369
- Ah, better lost than in the wrong hands.
- <i>How soon can you rebuild it?</i>

10:24.370 --> 10:26.133
Rebuild it?

10:27.434 --> 10:28.960
Not a chance.

10:29.861 --> 10:32.756
My people in Washington will
have something to say about that.

10:32.757 --> 10:37.093
Your people in Washington want to turn
anything that flies into a weapon.

10:37.294 --> 10:39.520
Apparently someone else had the same idea.

10:39.521 --> 10:42.615
- Sir, I'm afraid we must insist.
- I'm remind you, boys,

10:42.616 --> 10:44.976
I don't work for the government.

10:44.977 --> 10:47.880
I cooperate at my discretion.

10:48.481 --> 10:51.683
Two of my best pilots were
killed during the test phase.

10:51.684 --> 10:55.111
God knows how many more men
would have died if it had flown.

10:55.912 --> 10:58.023
No, gentlemen.

10:58.824 --> 11:01.946
<i>I'm sorry I ever dreamed the damn thing up.</i>

11:03.303 --> 11:05.955
Sir, I wish you'd reconsider.

11:05.956 --> 11:08.792
What do we tell the president?

11:10.393 --> 11:13.421
<i>Tell him the dream is over.</i>

11:14.222 --> 11:17.237
Tell him Howard Hughes said so.

11:19.869 --> 11:22.013
<i>What's this 300 gallons here?</i>

11:22.014 --> 11:24.307
We don't burn that much fuel
in two years! We got o...

11:24.308 --> 11:28.128
You burned it in two seconds when my
fuel truck went up. It's all itemized...

11:28.129 --> 11:31.690
Hey, hey, I didn't blow up your
truck. The guy in the car did.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.942
After bouncing off you.

11:33.943 --> 11:36.911
Pilots are responsible for a
safe landing, you know that.

11:36.912 --> 11:40.631
Where we gonna get this kind of dough?
We've gotta sell the Gee Bee for scrap!

11:40.632 --> 11:43.702
I'm sorry, folks. I hate to
kick you when you're down.

11:43.703 --> 11:47.964
But business is business.
I'm out of pocket here.

11:48.865 --> 11:52.176
Of course, I... could always
use the old clown act.

11:52.177 --> 11:56.756
- We don't do the clown act no more.
- Peevy, Peevy, it's worth fifteen bucks a shot.

11:56.757 --> 12:00.152
10 bucks a shot, 5 bucks goes toward your bill.

12:00.553 --> 12:04.989
Think it over, boys. See it
my way or see me in court.

12:04.990 --> 12:07.350
That clown suit is in the storeroom.

12:07.351 --> 12:10.424
First show's at nine. Don't be late.

12:13.357 --> 12:15.734
Lousy nickel-nurser.

12:17.535 --> 12:22.407
Clown act! Good thinking, Clifford!
You just set us back about four years.

12:22.408 --> 12:26.244
Plus which "Miss Mabel" here is a
flying coffin. You said so yourself...

12:26.245 --> 12:29.906
Peevy, she never let us down before.
Beside I'll go real easy on her.

12:29.907 --> 12:34.510
Number five piston is shot, nothing
left but spit and bitter wire.

12:34.811 --> 12:37.674
I could fly a shoe box if it had wings, Peev.

12:37.973 --> 12:39.799
- Ouch!
- What's? What's the matter?

12:39.800 --> 12:42.188
I don't know, there's
somethin' under this seat.

12:48.007 --> 12:49.934
That's my duffel bag.

12:49.935 --> 12:53.372
- What've you got in there?
- I don't know, but it's heavy.

12:53.973 --> 12:57.078
- Hey, Peev, clean that table off.
- All right.

13:05.909 --> 13:07.496
Open her up.

13:17.053 --> 13:22.545
- Oh, my! What've we got here?
- Here, take the bag.

13:28.766 --> 13:31.693
- That's a piece of work, isn't it?
- Yeah.

13:31.694 --> 13:34.112
What do you suppose it
is, a bomb or somethin'?

13:34.713 --> 13:36.781
Too complex to be a bomb.

13:37.082 --> 13:39.600
I don't see any moving parts.

13:39.601 --> 13:41.381
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.

14:07.838 --> 14:10.223
- The housing's still cool.
- Huh.

14:12.324 --> 14:14.402
Runs on alcohol.

14:14.603 --> 14:17.146
What's the damn thing for?

14:18.847 --> 14:20.099
- Hold it, Peev.
- Huh?

14:20.100 --> 14:21.388
Hold it!

14:46.743 --> 14:48.586
Tip her over. Tip her over.

14:48.587 --> 14:50.475
- Easy, easy!
- I got it.

14:52.416 --> 14:53.554
Watch it.

15:02.192 --> 15:05.028
What's goin' on, Sinclair? Lenny is dead.

15:05.029 --> 15:08.114
Wilmer's wrapped up like
a mummy in County General.

15:08.115 --> 15:10.730
You didn't play straight with me.

15:13.637 --> 15:16.748
I'm sorry about your boys, Eddie... truly.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.317
And what went wrong?

15:18.318 --> 15:21.502
What went wrong? It's
the feds that went wrong.

15:21.503 --> 15:25.740
This was supposed to be a simple
snatch-and-grab. What the hell is going on?

15:26.341 --> 15:27.900
I didn't say it'd be simple, Eddie.

15:27.901 --> 15:31.162
And, snatch-and-grab is what
you're supposed to be good at.

15:31.163 --> 15:33.090
That's what I pay you for.

15:33.891 --> 15:35.817
Now where's the package?

15:35.818 --> 15:38.302
Nothing's gonna happen with me
and my boys until you tell me...

15:38.303 --> 15:40.900
exactly why this merchandise
is so important to the feds.

15:45.736 --> 15:48.196
Send me a cheque.

15:48.197 --> 15:52.386
- Let's get out of here, boys.
- It's a rocket.

15:55.545 --> 15:57.574
A rocket?

15:59.116 --> 16:03.588
Yeah... like in the comic books.

16:05.647 --> 16:08.233
- Then what happened to it?
- I don't know.

16:08.634 --> 16:11.469
Wilmer knows. He's in the
hospital surrounded by cops.

16:11.470 --> 16:14.705
- Maybe in a couple of days, we ta...
- We don't have a couple of days, Eddie.

16:15.706 --> 16:17.314
What room's Wilmer in?

16:21.847 --> 16:24.190
Mr. Movie Star!

16:24.191 --> 16:28.311
He's gonna walk in to the hospital with a
smile on his face and a handful of posies.

16:28.312 --> 16:30.559
He's gonna charm the feds to death.

16:35.661 --> 16:37.996
That's not exactly what I had in mind.

16:37.997 --> 16:40.432
Who cares what you had in mind?

16:42.033 --> 16:44.168
<i>You don't need my services any more.</i>

16:44.169 --> 16:46.629
<i>You can take it from here. I'll tell you what.</i>

16:46.630 --> 16:49.644
You pay me what you owe me
because you're half lunatic anyhow.

16:53.719 --> 16:55.145
Yes, shoot!

16:55.446 --> 17:00.167
I want that rocket, Eddie, not
next week, not tomorrow... now.

17:00.568 --> 17:02.640
We have a deal?

17:10.996 --> 17:15.928
You bring me that rocket
and I'll double your price.

17:24.451 --> 17:27.374
You'll triple my price.

17:35.837 --> 17:38.718
What's a movie star need a rocket for anyway?

17:45.889 --> 17:48.327
Bloody amateurs!

18:11.882 --> 18:13.925
Yes.

18:13.926 --> 18:17.929
<i>Lothar, I've got another job for you...</i>

18:18.230 --> 18:20.685
<i>a condolence call.</i>

18:32.467 --> 18:33.906
Come on, Peev.

18:43.404 --> 18:45.719
Here goes.

18:58.261 --> 19:02.126
Well, I'm lookin' at it but I don't believe it.

19:07.429 --> 19:09.913
- Peevy... the stake!
- Come on, get down!

19:09.914 --> 19:11.685
That thing'll cut you in half.

19:25.045 --> 19:26.839
We lost it.

19:27.340 --> 19:29.500
I told you I should have tested it myself.

19:29.501 --> 19:34.050
Yeah, you'd be halfway to
Kansas by now, chowder head!

19:58.638 --> 20:00.877
Turn her off! Turn her off!

20:03.935 --> 20:06.204
That might've woke up the whole valley.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.292
Pick her up. Come on, let's get out of here.

20:12.427 --> 20:15.379
Peevy, you'd pay to see
a man fly, wouldn't you?

20:15.380 --> 20:16.297
Ha!

20:16.698 --> 20:18.334
You've gotta be outta your mind.

20:18.335 --> 20:20.626
Look, I'm talkin' about making
its real money here, Peevy.

20:20.627 --> 20:24.722
Not just 10 bucks a show but enough to get
us back on our feet and into the nationals.

20:24.723 --> 20:26.581
Are your eyes painted on, Clifford?

20:26.582 --> 20:29.276
This thing is like strapping
nitroglycerine to your back.

20:29.277 --> 20:32.071
- Bisides, the feds are mixed up in this.
- I don't want to keep it.

20:32.072 --> 20:34.732
- I just want to borrow it for a while.
- Clifford...

20:34.733 --> 20:38.269
when you borrow something and don't tell
nobody, they call that stealing, you know.

20:38.270 --> 20:42.456
Just a couple weeks, as soon as we can
afford a new plane, we'll give it back. I swear.

20:42.457 --> 20:44.876
Clifford, did you see what
this thing did back there?

20:44.877 --> 20:49.975
You're always telling me what
a genius you are up here! Fix it.

20:51.491 --> 20:54.062
We're gonna need one hell of a lawyer.

20:59.215 --> 21:01.854
I think we're gonna need a helmet.

21:02.055 --> 21:04.921
<i># You're a sweet little headache #</i>

21:04.922 --> 21:08.984
<i># But you are lots of fun #</i>

21:11.159 --> 21:12.770
Whose is it?

21:13.671 --> 21:15.259
Yours.

21:31.748 --> 21:33.291
'Evening, Miss Pye.

21:33.492 --> 21:37.019
You know my rules, no
gentlemen after 6:00 p.m.

21:37.020 --> 21:40.826
- Well, I'm no gentleman.
- You can say that again.

21:41.958 --> 21:43.801
- Hello.
- Hi.

21:43.802 --> 21:46.512
- Good night, Mrs. Pye.
- Have a good time, dear.

21:46.513 --> 21:49.965
If he tries anything, deck
him. Don't forget the curfew.

21:49.966 --> 21:54.462
- I lock up at 11:00 sharp.
- Yes, warden.

21:54.463 --> 21:57.573
Clifford, guess what? I think I got the part.

21:57.574 --> 21:59.350
- That's great.
- I won't know for sure 'til tomorrow,

21:59.351 --> 22:02.236
but, the director said he
liked my reading the best.

22:02.237 --> 22:05.489
- Oh, you mean, you have lines this time.
- Just one.

22:05.490 --> 22:08.784
- But it's to Neville Sinclair.
- Okay!

22:08.785 --> 22:10.720
Let's hear it.

22:11.121 --> 22:13.331
"Oh, my prince.

22:13.532 --> 22:17.193
would that you'd drink of my lips as deeply."

22:17.794 --> 22:19.913
And then he kisses you?

22:20.714 --> 22:24.041
No. He's too busy killing someone.

22:24.042 --> 22:27.011
- Now you tell me.
- What?

22:27.012 --> 22:30.056
The maiden voyage. How'd she fly?

22:30.057 --> 22:33.809
She flew great. Landing had a few bumps.

22:34.410 --> 22:37.229
Hey, we'd better scram if we're
gonna catch this Cagney movie.

22:37.230 --> 22:39.398
Uh-uh-uh. It's my turn to pick.

22:40.499 --> 22:41.400
Uh-oh.

22:41.401 --> 22:45.571
- There's a new Neville Sinclair movie.
- Oh, Jen, you know Cagney's better.

22:45.572 --> 22:48.341
Come on, you won't catch Cagney
lounging around his penthouse...

22:48.342 --> 22:51.660
on his wear, walking poodles
in the park, or doing any of...

22:51.661 --> 22:54.413
Or getting shot down behind enemy lines?

22:54.414 --> 22:56.874
- What are you talking about?
- The movie,

22:56.875 --> 22:59.126
"Wings of Honor."

22:59.127 --> 23:01.796
- Neville Sinclair?
- Uh-huh.

23:01.797 --> 23:03.798
Oh, brother.

23:04.399 --> 23:06.217
This I gotta see.

23:06.418 --> 23:10.805
<i>Hitler assures the western powers he is
not massing troops at the Czech border.</i>

23:10.806 --> 23:13.257
<i>Here comes the Fuhrer's latest
symbol of German progress,</i>

23:13.258 --> 23:16.319
<i>the airship "Luxembourg,"
beginning its American tour...</i>

23:16.320 --> 23:18.729
- <i>to promote world peace.</i>
- World peace!

23:18.730 --> 23:20.815
What he means is a piece of the world!

23:21.416 --> 23:22.858
Excuse me.

23:22.859 --> 23:27.654
- <i>...on the first stop of their goodwill tour...</i>
- Their last goodwill tour

23:27.655 --> 23:30.282
- buried half of Europe.
- Shh.

23:31.483 --> 23:33.410
<i>...though filled with explosive hydrogen...</i>

23:33.411 --> 23:36.967
Your Gee Bee could fly
circles around that thing.

23:38.875 --> 23:42.253
<i>After the short visit, it was into
the clouds to continue a journey...</i>

23:42.254 --> 23:45.005
<i>that will carry the "Luxembourg"
to Chicago, St. Louis,</i>

23:45.006 --> 23:48.175
<i>across the Rockies... and
finally to Los Angeles.</i>

23:48.176 --> 23:50.764
<i>Look us up, boys, when you get to Hollywood.</i>

24:40.736 --> 24:44.098
Who's there? Who is it?

24:44.899 --> 24:48.486
- What do you want?
- Where is it?

24:49.187 --> 24:52.514
- Where's what?
- The rocket.

24:52.515 --> 24:55.270
I don't answer to nobody but Eddie Valentine.

24:57.829 --> 25:00.439
Okay, okay, okay! Ease off, ease off!

25:00.440 --> 25:03.701
I pulled a switch, see. I got the
package stashed real good.

25:03.702 --> 25:07.182
It's at the airfield, hangar
3. It's in some old plane.

25:25.498 --> 25:28.620
- Hey, open this door.
- Are you okay?

25:29.811 --> 25:31.725
What is it? What happened?

25:53.542 --> 25:57.263
<i>And then, get this, fellas,
at the end of the movie...</i>

25:57.264 --> 26:00.349
<i>he flies over enemy trenches
and drops a bottle of champagne.</i>

26:00.350 --> 26:04.636
And let me guess. It hits the
general and we win the war, right.

26:04.637 --> 26:06.964
It was symbolic. He was being chivalrous.

26:06.965 --> 26:11.143
Where'd he get the champagne? They didn't
have liquor stores at the front, did they?

26:11.144 --> 26:13.796
Not that I recall. It would be nice...

26:13.797 --> 26:18.217
It doesn't matter where he got it
from. That's not the point. It's just...

26:19.918 --> 26:21.370
Forget it.

26:21.971 --> 26:28.578
- Malcolm, the wheel came off.
- Oh, oh, let me see, princess.

26:28.579 --> 26:32.298
Yeah, sure, sure we'll fix her up.

26:32.299 --> 26:35.387
Did I ever tell you about the time
I got shot down by the Red Baron?

26:38.454 --> 26:39.906
No?

26:40.307 --> 26:43.559
There I was flying over
the Ardennes on patrol...

26:43.560 --> 26:49.019
when he suddenly comes screaming out of
the sun, guns blazing, and then, smack!

26:53.461 --> 26:56.655
- Bull's-eye, ace.
- I'm sorry, Jenny.

26:56.656 --> 26:58.869
Oh, it's okay, Malcolm.

27:00.501 --> 27:02.798
Thanks, Cliff.

27:04.414 --> 27:05.957
You know, Cliff,

27:06.458 --> 27:11.036
Once a while, it wouldn't hurt to try
someplace new, maybe away from the airfield.

27:11.037 --> 27:14.381
Like where? The Copa? The Brown Derby?

27:14.382 --> 27:17.092
Why not the South Seas
Club while you're dreamin'.

27:17.093 --> 27:19.511
Okay, how about this.

27:19.512 --> 27:24.608
We'll go have a real night on the
town, after you win the nationals.

27:24.909 --> 27:29.203
<i>Yeah, swell, after I win the nationals.</i>

27:29.204 --> 27:31.023
You gonna fly in the nationals after all?

27:31.024 --> 27:33.492
Well, glad to hear it, after that landing today.

27:33.493 --> 27:35.938
- How about a warm-up, Malcolm?
- <i>Ha?</i>

27:38.139 --> 27:39.807
You said there were a few bumps.

27:39.808 --> 27:43.678
Ohh, boy, I'll say. She folded like
a kite when she hit the runway.

27:43.679 --> 27:47.068
We thought Cliffie's number
was up, with the fire and all.

27:54.430 --> 27:56.143
I... I was gonna tell ya.

27:58.142 --> 28:00.094
I... I didn't want to ruin your evening.

28:00.095 --> 28:04.267
Thank you! It's very thoughtful of
you. You'd rather make a fool of me?

28:06.425 --> 28:10.162
- I'm sorry.
- I don't want you to be sorry, Cliff.

28:10.563 --> 28:14.942
I want you to stop treating
me like... like a stranger.

28:14.943 --> 28:18.703
When something goes wrong, I
should be the first one to know that.

28:18.704 --> 28:20.664
I shouldn't be the last.

28:21.065 --> 28:24.437
Jenny, everyone knows because
they were at the airfield.

28:25.829 --> 28:28.330
I had an audition.

28:28.731 --> 28:30.932
It was important to me.

28:31.433 --> 28:32.668
I understand.

28:32.669 --> 28:34.937
Just like the last time
when I flew the regionals.

28:34.938 --> 28:38.827
You got a big part. You stood behind
Myrna Loy with a bowl of grapes.

28:40.885 --> 28:44.558
Good night, Millie. Thank you for the soup.

28:47.924 --> 28:48.634
Well,

28:49.235 --> 28:51.398
go after her, you dope.

28:55.006 --> 28:55.936
Jenny!

29:03.158 --> 29:05.918
Cliff, I, uh...

29:06.119 --> 29:10.748
- I'm sorry, I really stuck...
- Oh, Malcolm, it's okay.

29:10.749 --> 29:13.295
Sorry, it's not your fault.

29:32.953 --> 29:36.315
- Well, did you have a good time?
- Yeah.

29:36.916 --> 29:39.043
Go ahead and stick that
welding torch in my ear,

29:39.044 --> 29:41.766
and we'll call it the end of a perfect day.

29:45.066 --> 29:47.960
What're you two scrappin' about this time?

29:48.861 --> 29:50.662
I don't know, Peev.

29:50.663 --> 29:52.998
I just can't figure this girl out.

29:53.199 --> 29:55.243
She hangs around with this
Hollywood crowd all day,

29:55.244 --> 29:58.837
talkin' about... movie stars and nightclubs...

29:58.838 --> 30:00.083
So what? That's her work.

30:00.084 --> 30:03.575
She don't care about them
phoney-baloneys. She cares about you.

30:03.576 --> 30:06.495
But I want her to think I'm makin'
something of myself, Peev,

30:06.496 --> 30:09.473
not that I'm just an out-of-work
pilot with holes in his packet.

30:09.474 --> 30:11.950
You got a good thing goin'
with that girl, Clifford.

30:11.951 --> 30:16.306
But, if she flies the coop, I'm tellin' you
right now, it's gonna be your fault.

30:17.607 --> 30:20.200
What do you know about women, Peev?

30:20.601 --> 30:23.996
You haven't had a date since 1932.

30:24.897 --> 30:27.491
Flora Maxwell.

30:27.492 --> 30:30.557
There was no point in datin' nobody after her.

31:05.396 --> 31:07.434
He's got to be kidding!

31:22.730 --> 31:26.541
What? Kill me as I stand? I
thought you were a sporting man.

31:26.542 --> 31:30.858
True. I'd hate to stain my
legend on a villain such as you.

31:39.147 --> 31:43.261
Prepare to die that we may learn
the identity of the Laughing Bandit.

31:43.526 --> 31:45.504
Why wait?

31:47.305 --> 31:50.059
Good heavens! It's Sir Reginald!

31:50.060 --> 31:51.353
None other!

32:03.411 --> 32:08.077
Oh, my prince, would that you'd
drink of my lips as deeply.

32:09.043 --> 32:13.391
Cut! Cut! Cut! Back to first positions.

32:16.684 --> 32:19.895
Oh, good lord! Victor, how many
times are we gonna have to do this?

32:19.896 --> 32:23.741
Sweetheart, acting is acting
like you're not acting.

32:23.742 --> 32:27.184
So act, but don't act like you're acting, get it?

32:27.185 --> 32:28.806
- All right.
- Why we don't try that?

32:31.366 --> 32:35.844
Boy, eh... boy, is she a block of wood!
I mean your audition was so much better.

32:35.845 --> 32:40.057
Irma, everybody's audition was better! Does it
matter when you're the producer's niece?

32:40.058 --> 32:43.251
She gets a scene with Neville
Sinclair and we play scenery.

32:43.252 --> 32:46.797
- I love Hollywood.
- All right, everybody, positions.

32:46.798 --> 32:49.549
And please let's try to get it right this time.

32:49.550 --> 32:52.970
"Laughing Bandit," scene 114, take 28.

32:52.971 --> 32:55.555
And... action!

33:02.263 --> 33:05.862
<i>What? Kill me as I stand? I thought
you were a sporting man.</i>

33:05.863 --> 33:10.221
<i>True, I'd hate to stain my
legend on a villain such as you.</i>

33:12.122 --> 33:16.276
<i>Prepare to die that we may learn
the identity of the Laughing Bandit.</i>

33:16.777 --> 33:17.732
<i>Why wait?</i>

33:18.352 --> 33:20.625
<i>Good heavens!, It's Sir Reginald!</i>

33:22.959 --> 33:24.789
<i>None other.</i>

33:28.923 --> 33:33.430
Oh, my prince, would that you'd
drink of my lips as deeply.

33:50.511 --> 33:53.113
Excuse me. I'm looking for Jenny Blake.

33:53.514 --> 34:00.229
Oh, Jenny... Jenny Blake, yeah.
Does anyone know a Jenny Blake?

34:01.030 --> 34:02.456
Cut.

34:02.857 --> 34:05.424
- <i>I hope he's okay.
- Where's Mr. Sinclair?</i>

34:05.425 --> 34:07.460
<i>Give us a hand with this flat, will you.</i>

34:08.061 --> 34:11.639
- You okay, Mr. Sinclair?
- I'm fine.

34:12.241 --> 34:16.335
Well, never let it be said Neville Sinclair
failed to bring down the house.

34:17.137 --> 34:20.342
Somebody call the nurse!
Charlie's been stabbed!

34:21.516 --> 34:22.743
Charlie!

34:24.244 --> 34:25.529
Charlie.

34:25.730 --> 34:28.690
Oh, my God, forgive me, Charlie. I had no idea.

34:28.690 --> 34:34.721
- Did you think I was stealing the scene?
- Don't talk. Don't even move.

34:34.922 --> 34:37.824
John, get my car and driver.
Get him to The Queen of Angels.

34:37.824 --> 34:40.710
Gladys, ride with him. I'll have my
personal physician meet you, there.

34:41.112 --> 34:43.496
Victor, come here.

34:43.898 --> 34:47.083
This is supposed to be a
closed set... no visitors!

34:47.085 --> 34:51.340
I want that... Jenny banned from the lot.

34:53.882 --> 34:55.726
<i>Jenny, Jenny, I said I'm sorry.</i>

34:55.726 --> 34:59.179
- Look, I just want to patch things up.
- You're off to a great start.

34:59.180 --> 34:59.983
Look, Jenny,

34:59.984 --> 35:03.391
something really big has happened
and I want you to be the first to know.

35:03.392 --> 35:05.835
- <i>I'm listening.
- Me and Peevy found something...</i>

35:05.836 --> 35:07.971
<i>that's gonna get us way back on our feet.</i>

35:08.972 --> 35:12.258
- What do you mean, found something?
- It's an engine...

35:12.259 --> 35:16.696
<i>okay... but you strap it to your back...
and it makes you fly without wings.</i>

35:16.697 --> 35:21.267
<i>You knocked down half the castle
to come tell me about an engine?</i>

35:21.268 --> 35:23.411
<i>You're always saying you're the last to know.</i>

35:23.412 --> 35:26.623
<i>Cliff, I meant the important things.</i>

35:26.624 --> 35:29.543
- <i>This is important.
- And so is this acting job.</i>

35:29.544 --> 35:32.212
- <i>Acting?
- Yes, acting.</i>

35:32.213 --> 35:34.923
<i>Honey, you're walking through the scenery.</i>

35:34.924 --> 35:37.259
<i>That's not fair. This is a good job.</i>

35:37.260 --> 35:39.469
The director thinks I'm talented.

35:41.070 --> 35:41.838
What's this?

35:41.839 --> 35:44.141
Pay voucher. The director
wants you off the picture.

35:44.142 --> 35:47.602
- <i>You know this is a closed set.</i>
- I have to go.

35:47.603 --> 35:50.908
Come on, come on. You know
what a closed set means, pal?

36:03.444 --> 36:04.357
Hey!

36:28.477 --> 36:31.776
- Victor, where's that girl I told you to fire?
- I fired her.

36:42.491 --> 36:47.585
Hello. I'm Neville Sinclair. You must be...

36:48.886 --> 36:50.167
Jenny Blake.

36:52.134 --> 36:55.994
I... I'd hate to think
that I may have been...

36:56.295 --> 36:59.365
I'm responsible for your
having been dismissed.

36:59.366 --> 37:04.586
- Will you stay?
- But it's... it's really my fault, Mr. Sinclair.

37:04.887 --> 37:07.558
Have you read for the part
of the Saxon princess?

37:09.459 --> 37:10.644
No.

37:11.045 --> 37:13.697
I think you might be wonderful in the role.

37:13.898 --> 37:17.951
I'll see that you do. Perhaps
we could discuss it over dinner.

37:18.052 --> 37:21.871
I've got a regular table at the South Seas Club
if you're not too bored with the S. Seas club.

37:21.872 --> 37:25.909
- I'd love to Mr...
- Neville.

37:25.910 --> 37:28.545
- Neville.
- Tonight then.

37:29.346 --> 37:31.978
<i>Okay, let's get all the atmosphere over here.</i>

37:36.379 --> 37:40.178
<i>Hey ladies in waiting? We're waiting! Let's go.</i>

37:44.002 --> 37:49.766
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the Travelair
Mystery Ship has taken over the lead.</i>

37:49.767 --> 37:53.520
<i>We have clocked him at 192 miles per hour.</i>

37:53.521 --> 37:57.240
Programs! Five cents!
Five cents, one program.

37:57.241 --> 37:58.571
Here you are.

37:58.772 --> 38:00.168
- Malcolm.
- Hum?

38:00.169 --> 38:03.071
- I sold seven.
- Ah, good. Here's more.

38:03.472 --> 38:05.448
Programs! Programs!

38:05.449 --> 38:08.910
<i>As you can see, folks, Miss
Los Angeles is trailing badly.</i>

38:08.911 --> 38:10.954
<i>She was down with some
mechanical problems...</i>

38:10.955 --> 38:15.125
- <i>and she may be in trouble.</i>
- Park it away from the runway.

38:15.126 --> 38:17.752
- What's wrong with that kid? I told him 9:00.
- He'll be here.

38:17.753 --> 38:21.313
If he ain't in the air in 5 minutes,
you got to find a new hangar.

38:21.314 --> 38:23.883
<i>Howard in the Great Lakes Biplane...</i>

38:23.884 --> 38:27.887
<i>is really pouring it on, he is
runnin' 3rd but keep movin'!</i>

38:27.888 --> 38:29.806
<i>This could end up in a three-way heat.</i>

38:29.807 --> 38:33.977
I know what Wilmer told Sinclair's goon,
but the rocket ain't in hangar three.

38:33.978 --> 38:37.380
There's an old plane right, but
the only thing in it was this.

38:37.481 --> 38:39.374
- Nice.
- That's it?

38:39.575 --> 38:41.518
We searched this place
from hell to breakfast.

38:41.519 --> 38:45.638
I want you to start over. search it
again, turn it inside out, upside down.

38:45.839 --> 38:47.607
Keep your eyes open for this dame.

38:47.608 --> 38:50.827
She might be the one who knows where
this guy is who found our package, all right.

38:50.828 --> 38:53.549
Okay, Eddie. All right, let's go.

39:03.382 --> 39:07.260
<i>To dazzle you with an exhibition of skills...</i>

39:07.261 --> 39:11.808
<i>is Cliff Secord, the Fearless
Freep. and there he goes!</i>

39:23.085 --> 39:24.527
That's not the routine!

39:24.528 --> 39:27.280
What the hell is Secord trying to pull?

39:27.681 --> 39:30.725
Thanks a lot, I'm two minutes late.
Who'd you put up in Miss Mabel?

39:30.726 --> 39:37.601
- <i>Five cents!</i> Get your program! <i>Five cents!</i>
- That's gotta be Malcolm, up there.

39:38.917 --> 39:41.364
Flag that biplane down now!

39:43.706 --> 39:47.217
He hasn't been behind the stick in
25 years. What's he doin' up there?

39:47.218 --> 39:52.041
Tryin' to save your job, Cliff. If he drifts into
those race lanes he's gonna kill somebody.

39:56.176 --> 39:57.855
Oh, no.

40:02.016 --> 40:04.856
- The rocket's in the tool chest, right?
- Yeah.

40:05.543 --> 40:07.031
Why?

40:15.562 --> 40:16.578
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

40:16.579 --> 40:20.583
<i>We have an emergency. We have an
emergency! Please clear the field.</i>

40:20.584 --> 40:23.981
- Please clear the field...
- What, you outta your mind?

40:25.005 --> 40:29.259
Ladies and gentlemen, we all guess
we had you fooled for a minute.

40:29.260 --> 40:32.106
But it's all part of the show.

40:38.093 --> 40:40.787
Stay in your seats, please.

40:41.388 --> 40:43.874
- What are you doin'?
- What's it look like I'm doing?

40:43.875 --> 40:47.277
- Come on, give me a hand.
- No, Cliff, no! We haven't tested it enough.

40:47.278 --> 40:50.012
- Look what she did to...
- Peevy, cut it out! Cut it out!

40:50.013 --> 40:51.684
I'm scared enough as it is.

40:55.202 --> 40:59.414
Ok, listen, I reworked the throttle,
so just squeeze her like a gas pedal.

40:59.415 --> 41:00.533
If you want to stop,

41:00.534 --> 41:03.585
- mash down hard and let go.
- Okay.

41:03.586 --> 41:06.591
- Anything else?
- Yeah.

41:09.415 --> 41:10.795
A little luck.

41:16.356 --> 41:18.936
- How do I look?
- Like a hood ornament.

41:43.191 --> 41:44.568
Look at that!

41:45.669 --> 41:48.111
- Tell me you're gettin' this.
- I'm gettin' it. I'm gettin' it.

41:48.112 --> 41:50.117
I don't know what it is, but I'm gettin' it.

41:55.336 --> 41:57.433
- Malcolm!
- Aaah!

42:04.669 --> 42:06.156
Malcolm?

42:07.957 --> 42:10.026
Oh, Malcolm, wake up.

42:10.027 --> 42:14.350
Come on, It's me, Cliff. Wake up!
Wake up Malcolm. Come on!

42:15.023 --> 42:18.788
Ohh! Whoa!

42:20.046 --> 42:24.427
Oh, don't worry, folks. It's all part of the show.

42:37.346 --> 42:40.017
Oh, nooo!

42:50.150 --> 42:52.569
Malcolm, Malcolm, wake up.

42:52.570 --> 42:55.366
Wake up! Wake up!

42:56.356 --> 42:59.261
Come on, get up! Get out of here.

43:08.577 --> 43:11.799
Ah, it's all part of the show.

43:23.150 --> 43:27.604
Ohhh! Ha-ha-ha-ha.

43:27.605 --> 43:30.523
He's going west! He's going west!

43:31.224 --> 43:34.071
Go, go, go! Get out of the way!

43:39.958 --> 43:42.744
- Get off the phone!
- You heard me... a flying man!

43:43.245 --> 43:48.010
- Hold the front page!
- Yeah, I said... a rocket man!

44:08.461 --> 44:10.774
Oh, no!

44:17.780 --> 44:20.076
Whoa! Aaah!

44:23.117 --> 44:24.914
Whoa!

44:33.744 --> 44:34.932
Watch it!

44:40.118 --> 44:41.722
Big gopher.

44:44.197 --> 44:45.476
Oh, no!

45:08.730 --> 45:11.502
- Cliff!
- Huh?

45:21.376 --> 45:23.445
I like it!

45:25.846 --> 45:28.591
What in the hell is the matter with
you? Are you trying to kill yourself?

45:28.592 --> 45:32.345
We don't know how long this thing
stays up, how much fuel's in her...

45:32.346 --> 45:36.315
If you wanna look around you gotta use your
eyeballs. This thing's got a rudder on it.

45:36.316 --> 45:39.736
If you turn your head, you change
course. Hear what I'm sayin'?

45:40.337 --> 45:44.406
You banged that up pretty good. I don't
know if I'm gonna be able to fix that.

45:45.407 --> 45:47.076
Peevy, you can fix anything.

45:47.077 --> 45:51.972
Well... uh-oh! We got company.
Must be the news boys.

45:51.973 --> 45:54.867
- You put on quite a show.
- They can't find out who we are.

45:54.868 --> 45:58.725
Whoever owns this is gonna want it
back, and I'm just gettin' the hang of it.

46:04.845 --> 46:06.888
- Peevy, put it in neutral.
- What?

46:06.889 --> 46:11.587
Put it in neutral! You steer, I'll push.

46:28.868 --> 46:31.038
Get in the car.

46:32.239 --> 46:34.490
How 'bout some background on the flyin' man?

46:34.491 --> 46:36.375
- Yeah, give it to us.
- What's his name?

46:36.376 --> 46:39.545
Sorry, boys. It's a trade
secret... all part of the mystery.

46:39.546 --> 46:42.264
- Why don't you call him Rocket Boy?
- No, that's lousy!

46:42.265 --> 46:44.892
- <i>What about... Rocket Man?
- That's worse.</i>

46:44.893 --> 46:47.428
- <i>What about Missile Man?
- That stinks. Come on.</i>

46:47.429 --> 46:49.788
- <i>Bigelow, give us a better name.
- Come on, Bigelow.</i>

46:50.989 --> 46:52.464
How about Rocketeer?

46:52.465 --> 46:53.584
- Bingo!
- Yes!

46:53.765 --> 46:55.770
That'll work. Rocketeer it is.

46:55.771 --> 46:58.105
<i>Extra, extra! Man flies without plane!</i>

46:58.106 --> 47:00.749
<i>Extra, extra! Read all about it!</i>

47:00.750 --> 47:03.036
- It's so romantic.
- I bet he's handsome.

47:03.037 --> 47:05.171
Oh, I wish he'd rescue me.

47:06.172 --> 47:07.743
<i>Extra, extra!</i>

47:09.876 --> 47:13.713
<i>Come on, ready on the set.
Let's go everybody. Let's shoot.</i>

47:16.414 --> 47:17.925
<i>Congratulations, gentlemen.</i>

47:18.826 --> 47:20.753
<i>Thanks to the diligence of the FBI,</i>

47:20.754 --> 47:24.568
this peticular vacuum cleaner
will not fall into the wrong hands.

47:33.190 --> 47:36.272
Mr. Bigelow, FBI. We'd like a word with you.

47:48.723 --> 47:52.621
- Must be the maid's day off.
- Somebody's been lookin' for something.

48:02.327 --> 48:03.942
Give me some light, Fitch.

48:09.703 --> 48:11.304
Mother of mercy!

48:11.805 --> 48:13.856
He's been folded in half.

48:14.057 --> 48:16.154
Looks like he was writin' something.

48:23.582 --> 48:26.903
1635...

48:26.904 --> 48:29.917
Palm Terrace.

48:36.963 --> 48:40.182
If the vertical thrust is
1-28 inches per second...

48:42.383 --> 48:43.347
Cliff?

49:08.067 --> 49:09.528
<i>What do you want?</i>

49:09.529 --> 49:11.943
- <i>What are you doin' here? Get out of here.</i>
- Peevy!

49:15.093 --> 49:16.587
Cliff, get me out!

49:19.388 --> 49:20.643
<i>Peevy!</i>

49:31.718 --> 49:34.723
Aaah!

49:36.764 --> 49:38.669
Slats, Murphy, come with us.

49:40.526 --> 49:42.439
Murph, wait here for the high sign.

49:44.722 --> 49:46.276
Where is it?

49:47.976 --> 49:49.103
Where's what?

49:52.004 --> 49:54.076
The rocket!

49:56.542 --> 49:58.511
Sure you got the right house?

49:59.112 --> 50:03.527
Secord, Peabody! Open up! FBI.

50:07.487 --> 50:08.633
Get down!

50:10.723 --> 50:12.594
Let 'em have it, boys.

50:19.558 --> 50:21.913
Cliff? Cliff!

50:24.971 --> 50:26.340
Cliff?

50:27.441 --> 50:30.112
- Clifford!
- Peevy! Get down!

51:22.904 --> 51:26.168
- Hello, Neville.
- Hello, Clark.

51:30.318 --> 51:36.324
<i># When they begin the beguine #</i>

51:36.325 --> 51:42.773
<i># It brings back the sound
of music so tender #</i>

51:42.798 --> 51:48.796
<i># It brings back the night
of tropical splendour #</i>

51:49.721 --> 51:55.219
<i># It brings back a memory and a dream #</i>

51:56.437 --> 52:00.401
Neville...ha ha... you old scalawag!

52:00.808 --> 52:05.505
- Hello, Bill. How are you?
- Fallen off any chandeliers lately?

52:06.406 --> 52:08.782
Let me introduce you. Miss Jenny Blake,

52:08.783 --> 52:12.421
- Mr. W. C. Fields.
- Ah, charmed, my dear,

52:13.504 --> 52:15.247
doubly-charmed.

52:15.248 --> 52:19.394
- <i>Jenny... what a euphonious appellation.</i>
- Thank you.

52:20.395 --> 52:25.457
Oh, Jenny... excuse me for a moment.
I... I won't be long. Bill, look after her.

52:25.458 --> 52:28.444
I thought you'd never ask. Scram.

52:29.445 --> 52:35.476
<i>Ah, my little kumquat, I'm fully
prepared to listen to your life story.</i>

52:35.477 --> 52:37.778
Yeah, okay, I'll tell him.

52:37.779 --> 52:41.757
Spanish Johnny... he's checking on
the diner where the flyers hang out.

52:41.758 --> 52:43.946
All right, Stevie. Make me a Bromo, will you?

52:45.770 --> 52:46.679
What do you want?

52:47.480 --> 52:51.250
- Everything okay? We treatin' you good?
- Get to the point, Eddie. I'm busy.

52:51.251 --> 52:53.669
- Have you found the rocket?
- You're busy, huh?

52:53.670 --> 52:55.921
My guys are tearing up the
town looking for that rocket...

52:55.922 --> 52:58.951
- and you're busy... romancin' some dame.
- That dame...

52:58.952 --> 53:04.479
- happens to be Secord's girlfriend.
- Good. She'll tell us where Secord is.

53:04.780 --> 53:06.941
My boys'll get the truth
out of her in two minutes.

53:07.642 --> 53:12.613
Valentine... we're gonna do
what I think is necessary.

53:12.814 --> 53:16.717
And that includes breakin'
one of my men in half, ha?

53:16.718 --> 53:20.565
Next time you go after one
of my men, I'll kill you.

53:21.114 --> 53:23.932
Don't threaten me, Eddie. Just do your job.

53:24.933 --> 53:31.131
Hey, Sinclair, if the feds get me I'm takin'
you with me. I'm gonna tell 'em everything.

53:31.332 --> 53:33.067
Who do you think they'd believe?

53:33.168 --> 53:37.529
A cheap crook or the number
3 box-office star in America?

53:38.030 --> 53:39.843
Number 3 jerk!

53:47.239 --> 53:49.742
<i>The helmeted mystery man
disappeared into the ballbon hills...</i>

53:49.743 --> 53:53.620
<i>moments after the daring rescue and has
yet to step forward and identify himself.</i>

53:53.621 --> 53:57.066
<i>But air circus owner, Otis Bigelow,
promises his bird man will return.</i>

53:57.067 --> 54:00.853
<i>Until then all of Los Angeles is
buzzing. Who is the Rocketeer?</i>

54:00.854 --> 54:04.159
<i>And now, back to our program
of dance band favorites.</i>

54:07.468 --> 54:11.130
Okay. Here's the plan.

54:12.031 --> 54:15.242
We call the FBI... we get
rid of this damn thing.

54:15.243 --> 54:17.353
Peevy, the FBI's gonna lock us up.

54:17.354 --> 54:20.606
They think we were shooting at them. What
do you think was going on at the house?

54:20.607 --> 54:25.010
House? We don't got a house,
Clifford. We got a gazebo.

54:25.011 --> 54:28.622
Between the FBI and that
King Kong gentleman,

54:28.623 --> 54:31.258
we're gonna get ourselves
killed over this thing.

54:32.459 --> 54:36.650
Peevy? Peevy, open up.

54:38.391 --> 54:41.927
We just come from the airfield. It's Bigelow.

54:41.928 --> 54:44.730
- What about him?
- His office is crawling with cops.

54:44.731 --> 54:47.461
Somebody tore up his place like
they were looking for something.

54:47.462 --> 54:50.152
- Yeah, so?
- They killed him.

54:50.153 --> 54:53.990
Cliff, what's going on?

54:54.491 --> 54:55.578
I'll make the call.

55:28.975 --> 55:32.411
<i>FBI, Los Angeles. Agent Morris speaking.</i>

55:32.812 --> 55:34.755
<i>Hello?</i>

55:35.156 --> 55:38.450
- Ah, yeah... I'll be home soon, honey.
- <i>Who is this?</i>

55:38.451 --> 55:41.415
- I love you too.
- <i>Okay, wise guy.</i>

55:46.334 --> 55:48.610
<i>What can I do for you gents?</i>

55:48.611 --> 55:53.674
Madam, we're looking for a pilot
by the name of Cliff Secord.

55:54.475 --> 55:56.535
<i>Does anybody here know him?</i>

55:57.936 --> 55:59.755
Haven't seen him around.

55:59.956 --> 56:03.558
See, we need a flier for a real special job.

56:03.559 --> 56:05.527
<i>There's a lot of lettuce in this.</i>

56:06.128 --> 56:10.223
What do you say... we lay out a finder's fee?

56:10.724 --> 56:12.484
How 'bout it, dad?

56:12.485 --> 56:17.072
Secord! Oh, yeah, I know
him. Short fella, gimpy leg.

56:17.273 --> 56:19.524
Didn't he move to Cincinnati?

56:19.925 --> 56:21.839
Cincinnati.

56:25.790 --> 56:29.275
How 'bout you, bub? You know this Secord?

56:29.276 --> 56:32.104
If you boys aren't ordering,
I'm have to ask you to leave.

56:32.105 --> 56:34.377
We'll order, we'll order! Let's see.

56:36.884 --> 56:40.095
How 'bout those pies?
They look good, huh, boys?

56:40.096 --> 56:43.594
Mmm! Betcha they're home-made.

56:48.546 --> 56:50.522
Don't interrupt his meal.

56:50.523 --> 56:53.661
Yeah, I like coffee with my pie.

56:54.952 --> 56:56.570
You know, it's funny.

56:57.171 --> 56:59.501
I don't like music while I'm digesting.

57:01.868 --> 57:05.588
Listen, friend, we told you
we don't know where he is.

57:06.789 --> 57:10.920
Okay, pop, maybe we
can refresh your memory.

57:12.587 --> 57:16.409
Come on. Follow me.

57:19.318 --> 57:22.721
- Take a good look... 'cause you're next.
- <i>All right.</i>

57:22.722 --> 57:26.143
- Talk, dad, or get a facial.
- Drop dead, you weasel.

57:29.144 --> 57:31.496
I told you, I don't know where the hell he is.

57:31.497 --> 57:33.399
Leave him alone!

57:34.900 --> 57:36.485
Naughty boy.

57:36.986 --> 57:42.124
- <i>Please leave him alone.</i> Stop!
- Startin' to smoke, old timer.

57:42.525 --> 57:44.204
Hold it.

57:52.860 --> 57:56.404
Jenny. Lookie here, boys.

57:57.005 --> 58:00.496
Lady Luck, left her phone number.

58:04.662 --> 58:05.809
Mine!

58:07.441 --> 58:09.101
- Hello?
- <i>Hello.</i>

58:09.102 --> 58:15.256
This is the florist. I've got a lovely
bouquet of flowers here for Jenny.

58:15.257 --> 58:16.992
Who sent her flowers?

58:17.693 --> 58:19.427
Cliff Secord.

58:19.428 --> 58:21.655
- Oh, is that right?
- <i>That's right.</i>

58:21.856 --> 58:23.357
Well, tell him he's too late.

58:23.358 --> 58:27.530
Because she's gone to the South
Seas Club with Mr. Neville Sinclair.

58:28.621 --> 58:30.325
<i>Hello?</i>

58:30.933 --> 58:32.445
<i>Hello?</i>

58:34.526 --> 58:35.171
Come here.

58:38.272 --> 58:39.324
Rus, you're not gonna believe this.

58:39.325 --> 58:40.942
- Guess where the dish went.
- Where?

58:42.543 --> 58:44.970
With the limey to the South Seas Club.

58:45.771 --> 58:48.140
Do you think fancy-pants is
pullin' a fast one on Eddie?

58:48.141 --> 58:51.151
I don't know, but I don't like this.

58:51.352 --> 58:54.463
Jeff, you and Mikey stay here and
watch who walks into this joint.

58:54.464 --> 58:56.982
- Boys, been a pleasure.
- I'll call from the club.

58:56.983 --> 58:59.901
All right, Johnny. We'll take care of it.

58:59.902 --> 59:02.287
All right, everybody,

59:02.288 --> 59:06.375
relax and take it easy.
We're gonna be here a while.

59:06.576 --> 59:09.840
Hey, Mom, how 'bout a fresh pot of coffee?

59:14.650 --> 59:16.471
Swell outfit, dad.

59:23.000 --> 59:24.092
Hey!

59:24.693 --> 59:26.722
Here's Mr. Ketchup Bottle!

59:31.251 --> 59:34.686
<i>Hey, that's quite a dish you got there.</i>

59:34.687 --> 59:37.131
<i>Hey, wait a minute. That's Lady Luck!</i>

59:37.732 --> 59:38.566
Get the gun!

59:40.067 --> 59:42.530
I got it. I got it.

59:47.242 --> 59:50.702
Millie. I'm sorry about all this.
I'll fix everything. I Promise.

59:50.703 --> 59:54.984
Clifford, what's the deal? Are you nuts?

59:56.542 --> 59:58.910
Cliff, no! Not again.

59:58.911 --> 01:00:01.546
Peevy, half the city is looking for us, now.

01:00:01.547 --> 01:00:04.361
I can fly to that nightclub in five
minutes. and nobody can follow me.

01:00:04.362 --> 01:00:05.250
Take a cab.

01:00:05.251 --> 01:00:08.920
The only place this is going is back
to the feds. We had an agreement!

01:00:08.921 --> 01:00:15.135
Look! Peev, I'm sorry. I should've listened to
you from start, but Jenny's in trouble, now.

01:00:15.136 --> 01:00:17.379
That girl means more to me than...

01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:20.682
I love her, Peev.

01:00:20.683 --> 01:00:24.444
- Does she know that?
- She's gonna find out.

01:00:24.445 --> 01:00:27.772
You promise me one thing, when
she's safe this thing goes back!

01:00:27.773 --> 01:00:31.504
Right, you got my word at that and
I'm sorry I ever laid eyes on this thing.

01:00:32.286 --> 01:00:34.263
You might want this.

01:00:36.464 --> 01:00:37.899
I'll meet you back here.

01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:40.969
Hold it, hold it, hold it, you're
leaking like a sieve here.

01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:44.622
You must pick up a rickshave, if you'd hit that
button, we'd go all over the map by now.

01:00:44.623 --> 01:00:47.108
- Well, can you fix it?
- If I had a couple of hours.

01:00:47.109 --> 01:00:50.341
Peevy, we don't have a couple of minutes!
Come on, we need something quick.

01:00:52.757 --> 01:00:55.233
Let's see if our luck's still holdin'.

01:00:55.434 --> 01:00:56.585
Go on!

01:00:57.786 --> 01:01:01.100
- Right, Peevy, stand clear.
- What was that?

01:01:11.158 --> 01:01:13.413
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:01:15.262 --> 01:01:16.705
It's so elegant.

01:01:17.106 --> 01:01:21.070
You make it so. Here's to you...

01:01:23.003 --> 01:01:26.742
and to the extraordinary way
your face catches the light.

01:01:35.216 --> 01:01:37.525
You must let me have this dance.

01:01:38.526 --> 01:01:39.895
There's no music.

01:01:40.196 --> 01:01:41.942
Really?

01:01:46.811 --> 01:01:49.098
I hear music.

01:01:58.964 --> 01:02:01.002
That's Neville Sinclair.

01:02:25.224 --> 01:02:32.283
One day, Jenny, a man will look into those
eyes and he'll drown, and never be saved.

01:04:17.094 --> 01:04:20.931
<i># When you're alone #</i>

01:04:20.932 --> 01:04:24.601
<i># Who cares for starlit skies #</i>

01:04:24.602 --> 01:04:28.540
<i># When you're alone #</i>

01:04:28.541 --> 01:04:32.219
- <i># the magic moonlight dies #</i>
- Hey.

01:04:34.653 --> 01:04:38.659
- Is it something I said?
- No, no, it's nothing.

01:04:38.949 --> 01:04:42.121
Oh, Jenny, I know that look all too well.

01:04:42.119 --> 01:04:45.255
- Is it your boyfriend?
- I'm sorry, Neville.

01:04:45.456 --> 01:04:49.317
It's just that, Cliff and I talked
about coming here so many times.

01:04:50.118 --> 01:04:51.853
Tell me about him.

01:04:52.454 --> 01:04:55.924
At least give me a chance
to know the competition.

01:04:57.025 --> 01:05:00.845
Well, he's a little rough around the edges.

01:05:00.846 --> 01:05:03.339
He can be pretty thoughtless sometimes.

01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:08.172
And then he can, turn around
the sweetest guy in the world.

01:05:08.687 --> 01:05:11.556
He gave me these little
oranges when we first met.

01:05:11.857 --> 01:05:14.609
- <i>How nice.</i>
- My family has a small farm, and...

01:05:14.610 --> 01:05:17.195
Cliff was coming through our,
town, dusting the groves.

01:05:17.196 --> 01:05:21.783
- He's a flier?
- Yeah. He flies racing planes like this one.

01:05:21.784 --> 01:05:23.985
At least he did until yesterday.

01:05:23.986 --> 01:05:26.874
- He was almost killed.
- What happened?

01:05:28.661 --> 01:05:31.393
Oh, we didn't order anything. Go on.

01:05:31.394 --> 01:05:35.313
Ah, yes, sir. It was a fan of
yours sent some soup over.

01:05:36.214 --> 01:05:38.558
Go on. You were saying?

01:05:38.759 --> 01:05:40.927
It was very silly.

01:05:40.928 --> 01:05:43.346
He completely missed the runway.

01:05:43.347 --> 01:05:46.716
- I don't know why the real pilots let him fly.
- I see.

01:05:46.917 --> 01:05:50.148
At least I'm thinking I'm feeling
better about the competition.

01:05:54.016 --> 01:05:55.733
Have you worked here long?

01:05:55.734 --> 01:05:58.196
Oh, yes. I waited on you last time.

01:06:00.197 --> 01:06:02.377
So... um...

01:06:07.412 --> 01:06:09.497
um... where is he now?

01:06:09.498 --> 01:06:13.251
He's probably hatching
some harebrained scheme.

01:06:13.252 --> 01:06:17.012
Now he has an engine. Says
you strap it on back and...

01:06:17.013 --> 01:06:18.814
- I'm sorry.
- You idiot!

01:06:18.815 --> 01:06:20.133
How clumsy of me.

01:06:20.834 --> 01:06:23.203
- Go and get something to clean this up.
- Yes.

01:06:23.304 --> 01:06:27.074
- I'm sorry, Jenny.
- Will you just excuse me for a minute?

01:06:27.075 --> 01:06:31.823
- No, please stay. No, no, no, sit down.
- It's all right. I'll be right back.

01:06:43.423 --> 01:06:44.587
Are you out of your mind?

01:06:44.588 --> 01:06:45.491
- What are you doing here?
- Would you just...

01:06:45.492 --> 01:06:46.753
- listen to me for a minute.
- You're jealous.

01:06:46.754 --> 01:06:48.244
You thought I was with Neville, beside...

01:06:48.245 --> 01:06:51.873
No, I'm not jealous! Listen Jenny,
Bigelow's been murdered.

01:06:51.874 --> 01:06:52.933
Murdered?

01:06:52.934 --> 01:06:56.002
You remember at the studio what I
told you about the rocket we found?

01:06:56.003 --> 01:06:59.088
Well, the people that are looking for
it murdered Bigelow to get to me.

01:06:59.089 --> 01:07:03.193
Now they're after you. They have your
picture, the one from the Gee Bee.

01:07:03.194 --> 01:07:07.323
Jenny, prepare yourself for a shock.

01:07:08.824 --> 01:07:10.808
I'm the Rocketeer.

01:07:10.809 --> 01:07:12.318
The rocka-who?

01:07:12.519 --> 01:07:14.938
Ah, for cryin' out loud!
Haven't you read the papers?

01:07:14.939 --> 01:07:18.208
- No, I've been working all day.
- Look, it's them!

01:07:18.209 --> 01:07:20.177
The guys with the snapshot.

01:07:21.678 --> 01:07:23.112
You gotta get out of here.

01:07:23.113 --> 01:07:26.023
I want you to get in a cab, right
now, go to your mom's in Redlands...

01:07:26.024 --> 01:07:28.251
and stay there until you hear from me, ok?

01:07:28.652 --> 01:07:32.422
Give me one good reason why I
should believe any of this this?

01:07:33.623 --> 01:07:38.223
If anything ever happened to you, I'd
go out of my mind. I swear I would.

01:07:40.322 --> 01:07:41.293
Oh.

01:08:06.565 --> 01:08:10.122
Go on, scram, get out of here.
and don't let them see you.

01:08:34.359 --> 01:08:35.446
Thank you.

01:08:45.487 --> 01:08:47.959
Taxi!

01:08:56.832 --> 01:08:58.133
That's him.

01:09:00.743 --> 01:09:02.127
Go get him!

01:09:02.129 --> 01:09:02.942
Cutting in.

01:09:08.343 --> 01:09:09.581
Thank you!

01:09:32.734 --> 01:09:34.573
<i>He's in the laundry room.</i>

01:09:41.584 --> 01:09:43.081
Hit it!

01:09:48.634 --> 01:09:51.221
<i>The laundry chute!</i> Get him! Get him!

01:10:09.571 --> 01:10:12.643
- It's the flying man.
- It's the Rocketeer.

01:10:37.674 --> 01:10:41.105
- Lock the doors. We'll trap him like a fly.
- Right. <i>Lock the doors.</i>

01:11:17.038 --> 01:11:18.543
He's heading for the door.

01:11:43.165 --> 01:11:44.937
Get the rocket!

01:12:12.953 --> 01:12:17.118
Don't go, Jenny. Our evening's just begun.

01:14:14.615 --> 01:14:16.487
Welcome to my home.

01:14:19.229 --> 01:14:21.116
Here.

01:14:31.491 --> 01:14:33.834
It's the chloroform.

01:14:34.235 --> 01:14:36.933
The effects will pass in a moment.

01:14:41.350 --> 01:14:44.436
Do you have to drug all
your women to seduce them?

01:14:44.737 --> 01:14:48.007
You're part of this. You kidnapped me.

01:14:48.008 --> 01:14:51.091
Against my will, believe me.

01:14:51.786 --> 01:14:53.887
I'm as much a victim as you are.

01:14:54.088 --> 01:14:55.963
They're blackmailing me.

01:14:56.525 --> 01:14:59.459
These are brutal ruthless men, Jenny.

01:14:59.460 --> 01:15:01.328
Neville, I'm scared.

01:15:01.629 --> 01:15:05.127
Oh, there, there, there. Don't be frightened.

01:15:08.093 --> 01:15:09.870
Tonight when we danced,

01:15:11.071 --> 01:15:17.060
I felt something move inside me.
I felt it tear loose and take flight.

01:15:17.061 --> 01:15:19.830
You said that to Greta Garbo...

01:15:20.531 --> 01:15:22.949
in "Napoleon's Mistress."

01:15:23.450 --> 01:15:27.137
But, you'd have been a
fantastic Lady Catharine.

01:15:27.338 --> 01:15:32.251
If you'd put yourself,
completely into my hands,

01:15:32.252 --> 01:15:36.731
I could teach you, mould
you into a leading lady,

01:15:37.132 --> 01:15:41.301
clay... in the hands of the master sculptor.

01:15:41.302 --> 01:15:45.205
"Moonlight on Broadway." Carole Lombard.

01:15:45.206 --> 01:15:48.575
The scene on the top of
the Empire State Building.

01:15:49.976 --> 01:15:51.444
Yes.

01:15:51.445 --> 01:15:55.009
You can't be comfortable in that gown.

01:16:16.071 --> 01:16:18.209
They're beautiful.

01:16:33.546 --> 01:16:35.565
What am I doing?

01:16:36.466 --> 01:16:38.118
You kidnapped me.

01:16:39.319 --> 01:16:41.537
I'm so confused.

01:16:41.538 --> 01:16:44.293
I don't know what to think.

01:16:47.268 --> 01:16:50.967
- Do you want me to try this on?
- Desperately.

01:17:02.217 --> 01:17:03.759
<i>Neville?</i>

01:17:04.460 --> 01:17:06.615
Could you come in here, please?

01:17:10.767 --> 01:17:12.755
Can you help me?

01:17:28.701 --> 01:17:32.758
I finally played a scene with Neville Sinclair.

01:18:58.791 --> 01:19:02.702
Hello? Hello! Can anyone hear me?

01:19:03.103 --> 01:19:04.921
This is an emergency. Can you hear me?

01:19:04.922 --> 01:19:08.350
<i>Sinclair? <font color=#ff00ff>Sind sie das?</font> Is it you?</i>

01:19:08.551 --> 01:19:11.346
<i><font color=#ff00ff>Warum rufen sie an?</font> Why did you call?</i>

01:19:14.647 --> 01:19:16.841
- <i>Sinclair...</i>
- My God!

01:19:16.842 --> 01:19:19.089
Neville Sinclair is a...

01:19:23.149 --> 01:19:24.959
A what?

01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:27.394
Spy?

01:19:27.695 --> 01:19:29.914
Saboteur?

01:19:30.615 --> 01:19:32.917
A fascist?

01:19:33.618 --> 01:19:35.986
All of the above.

01:19:36.287 --> 01:19:38.501
Lothar.

01:20:07.193 --> 01:20:08.781
Millie?

01:20:19.372 --> 01:20:20.593
Peevy!

01:20:24.043 --> 01:20:27.044
- <i>Hey, Peev?
- Hey, Cliff!</i>

01:20:27.045 --> 01:20:27.963
Aaah!

01:20:30.041 --> 01:20:31.692
Are you okay?

01:20:33.093 --> 01:20:36.734
- Patsy, you scared the living, heck outta me.
- Sorry.

01:20:42.311 --> 01:20:43.375
- Peev?
- <i>Wrong.</i>

01:20:43.376 --> 01:20:45.189
- <i>This Secord?</i>
- Who is this?

01:20:45.190 --> 01:20:47.986
- Never mind. Wanna talk to your girlfriend?
- <i>Thanks a lot.</i>

01:20:47.987 --> 01:20:50.402
- <i>She's safe out of town by now.</i>
- Cliff, Cliff, is that you?

01:20:50.403 --> 01:20:52.654
<i>Jenny, where are you? What they do...</i>

01:20:52.655 --> 01:20:54.757
That's enough. Just to let
you know we're serious.

01:20:54.758 --> 01:20:56.943
<i>You wanna see your girlfriend,
you gonna bring us the rocket.</i>

01:20:56.944 --> 01:21:01.788
<i>Write this down. Griffith
Observatory, 4 a.m., by the statues.</i>

01:21:01.789 --> 01:21:04.953
<i>Come alone or we're
gonna have to kill the girl.</i>

01:21:12.475 --> 01:21:14.318
<i>Cliff, what's happening?</i>

01:21:14.619 --> 01:21:17.809
- What are they doing to Jenny?
- Quiet, Patsy, I gotta think.

01:21:22.243 --> 01:21:24.578
Patsy, I'm sorry.

01:21:24.579 --> 01:21:26.722
I didn't mean to yell at ya.

01:21:27.423 --> 01:21:31.067
Look, remember the guy
who saved Malcolm today?

01:21:31.068 --> 01:21:35.330
- The Rocketeer?
- Yeah. He's gonna help me find Jenny.

01:21:35.531 --> 01:21:36.986
Freeze! FBI.

01:21:44.607 --> 01:21:46.795
Remember me?

01:21:49.004 --> 01:21:53.674
All I did was bypass the pressure valve
and that solved your throttle problem.

01:21:53.675 --> 01:21:56.645
But adding a rudder to the
helmet... that was ingenious.

01:21:56.646 --> 01:22:01.490
Oh, nothin' to it, Howard. Just basic aviation.

01:22:01.491 --> 01:22:05.118
<i>We got so much on you,</i> we're gonna
make your life miserable, buddy.

01:22:05.119 --> 01:22:06.628
Good to see you, son.

01:22:06.629 --> 01:22:10.440
- Yeah, you too, pal.
- This is all he had on him.

01:22:10.641 --> 01:22:12.376
There's no sign of the rocket.

01:22:12.377 --> 01:22:15.632
He must've ditched it
somewhere, but he ain't talkin'.

01:22:21.244 --> 01:22:23.415
Wooly, take off the handcuffs.

01:22:26.432 --> 01:22:31.211
- You know who I am?
- What pilot doesn't, Mr. Hughes?

01:22:31.212 --> 01:22:37.253
I designed the Cirrus X-3, the rocket
pack. It was stolen from my factory.

01:22:38.344 --> 01:22:39.853
I didn't take it.

01:22:39.854 --> 01:22:44.540
Clifford, I told him everything that happend
and he believed it. Give the man his rocket.

01:22:44.541 --> 01:22:47.944
- I can't do that. Not yet.
- Clifford, we agreed...

01:22:47.945 --> 01:22:50.739
to give it back to its rightful owner. That's him.

01:22:50.740 --> 01:22:53.533
Seecord, I don't think you
know the game you're playing.

01:22:54.134 --> 01:22:55.905
Go ahead, roll it.

01:23:01.983 --> 01:23:05.645
The German prototype had the
same problem as our first design.

01:23:05.846 --> 01:23:08.799
The combustion chamber
would overheat and explode.

01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:10.401
My boys finally figured it out:

01:23:10.402 --> 01:23:13.388
a double-walled chamber into
which the fuel is pumped,

01:23:13.389 --> 01:23:16.565
cool the chamber and preheat
the fuel at the same time.

01:23:18.966 --> 01:23:22.095
<i>The German experiment didn't
seem like much to worry about.</i>

01:23:22.096 --> 01:23:26.383
<i>But when we got our hands on this next
film, we realized the scope of their plan.</i>

01:23:26.784 --> 01:23:31.902
<i>Keep watching, kid.</i> It cost a man's
life to get this out of Germany.

01:24:30.022 --> 01:24:32.301
Where's my rocket pack, Secord?

01:24:33.701 --> 01:24:35.651
You gotta let me use it one more time.

01:24:35.652 --> 01:24:37.037
I'm tired of square dancing with you, kid.

01:24:37.038 --> 01:24:41.391
I could slap you with grand theft, treason,
espionage, and that's just my short list.

01:24:41.392 --> 01:24:44.886
- Wooly, give me the cuffs.
- No, they got my girl.

01:24:44.887 --> 01:24:46.629
- Ah!
- Oh, God, Cliff, no!

01:24:46.630 --> 01:24:49.566
Yeah, they set up a rendezvous, they
want to swap Jenny for the rocket.

01:24:49.567 --> 01:24:52.369
Look kid, I understand how
you feel, but let us handle this.

01:24:52.370 --> 01:24:55.105
I gotta go alone or they're gonna kill her.

01:24:55.306 --> 01:24:58.042
I'll give you your rocket
back, tomorrow. I swear.

01:24:58.043 --> 01:25:01.128
Hey, this ain't negotiation
those guys are playing for keeps.

01:25:01.129 --> 01:25:02.563
I can handle Valentine.

01:25:02.564 --> 01:25:07.075
The Valentine gang is only hired muscle.
They're working for a Nazi agent,

01:25:07.076 --> 01:25:09.803
someone we think is highly
placed in Hollywood society,

01:25:09.804 --> 01:25:14.041
someone our intrepid G-men
have been unable to identify.

01:25:14.042 --> 01:25:16.386
- It's Neville Sinclair.
- What?

01:25:16.587 --> 01:25:18.094
It's Neville Sinclair!

01:25:18.095 --> 01:25:20.547
- Come on!
- Yeah sure, it makes perfect sense.

01:25:20.548 --> 01:25:24.735
That's why he was bossing Eddie's men
around the Seas Club and why he has Jenny.

01:25:24.736 --> 01:25:28.505
Nice try, kid. We're taking him
downtown and locking him up.

01:25:28.506 --> 01:25:32.171
We'll take it from here,
Mr. Hughes. Let's go, kid.

01:25:37.189 --> 01:25:38.394
No guns!

01:25:55.315 --> 01:25:57.912
The son-of-a-bitch will fly.

01:26:29.509 --> 01:26:33.873
- Here. Put this on.
- I'd rather freeze.

01:26:35.247 --> 01:26:38.369
You're right. I prefer you like that.

01:26:44.857 --> 01:26:47.901
Come on, cheer up, Eddie. You're
about to make yourself a fortune.

01:26:47.902 --> 01:26:51.788
Yeah, that's good 'cause I got a
club to repair and an ulcer to plug.

01:26:51.789 --> 01:26:55.770
Hey, boss! Here he comes.

01:27:42.815 --> 01:27:46.535
- Jenny, you okay?
- She's fine!

01:27:47.536 --> 01:27:49.508
I wasn't talkin' to you.

01:27:51.607 --> 01:27:55.913
Take the rocket off... carefully.

01:28:01.950 --> 01:28:04.338
First you let her go.

01:28:16.432 --> 01:28:19.187
The rocket, Secord!

01:28:23.838 --> 01:28:26.816
Come on, kid, hand it over
so we can all go home.

01:28:27.817 --> 01:28:33.549
What's it like working for a Nazi, Eddie, ha?
He pay you in dollars or Deutsche Marks?

01:28:34.950 --> 01:28:37.928
- What's he talking about?
- <i>Yeah, I got it straight from the feds, Eddie.</i>

01:28:37.929 --> 01:28:40.875
Nazi spy ring, flying commandos, the works.

01:28:44.376 --> 01:28:46.186
Kid's been flying where the air is too thin.

01:28:46.187 --> 01:28:49.790
Ask him about the secret room,
ask him the Germans on the radio.

01:28:49.791 --> 01:28:53.793
- Relax, Frankenstein. You ain't bullet proof.
- <i>Talk fast, Sinclair.</i>

01:28:53.794 --> 01:28:55.924
- You tell him, Eddie.
- Shut up!

01:28:57.990 --> 01:28:59.300
Oh, come on, Eddie,

01:29:00.201 --> 01:29:03.603
I'm paying you well. Does
it matter who I work for?

01:29:03.604 --> 01:29:05.740
It matters to me.

01:29:07.041 --> 01:29:11.227
I may not make an honest
buck, but I'm 100% American.

01:29:11.228 --> 01:29:13.783
And I don't work for no two-bit Nazi.

01:29:14.740 --> 01:29:15.878
Let her go.

01:29:22.998 --> 01:29:25.041
<font color=#ff00ff>Sturmabteilung!</font> Storm Department!

01:29:25.042 --> 01:29:27.543
<font color=#ff00ff>Angreifen!</font> Attack!

01:29:27.544 --> 01:29:30.299
<font color=#ff00ff>Los, los! Achtung!</font> Move, move! Listen up!

01:29:41.049 --> 01:29:42.820
It's your move, Eddie.

01:30:17.886 --> 01:30:19.981
<font color=#ff00ff>Ergreif die rakete. Schnell!</font> Seize the rocket! Fast!

01:30:19.993 --> 01:30:21.597
<font color=#ff00ff>Jawohl!</font> Aye aye!

01:30:21.598 --> 01:30:24.492
<font color=#ff00ff>Haltet sie in schach.</font> Keep them at bay.

01:30:25.093 --> 01:30:27.265
Good-bye, Eddie.

01:30:30.825 --> 01:30:33.070
Happy Valentine's Day.

01:30:38.290 --> 01:30:41.134
This is the FBI! <i>Throw down your guns.</i>

01:30:41.135 --> 01:30:43.164
- He's the Fed, shoot him!
- No!

01:30:50.553 --> 01:30:52.162
- Lousy krauts!
- Come on, lets go.

01:30:52.163 --> 01:30:53.758
Let 'em have it!

01:31:02.431 --> 01:31:04.474
Careful. He's got the girl!

01:31:05.775 --> 01:31:10.534
Watch out for that Zeppelin. It's full of
hydrogen. One bad shot, we'll all fry.

01:31:19.898 --> 01:31:22.754
Come on, boys. We got 'em on the run.

01:31:45.474 --> 01:31:48.251
<font color=#ff00ff>- Mein herr</font> My lord...
- Get this ship out of range.

01:31:48.252 --> 01:31:50.937
<font color=#ff00ff>- Schnell!</font> Fast!
<font color=#ff00ff>- Klar.</font> Understood.

01:31:51.438 --> 01:31:54.148
<font color=#ff00ff>Sie haben die rakete nicht? Antworten sie
mir!</font> Don't you have the rocket? Answer me!

01:31:54.149 --> 01:31:56.960
- Where's the rocket?
- We've got the girl.

01:31:57.461 --> 01:31:59.725
The rocket will come to us.

01:32:40.228 --> 01:32:42.167
Now, we're losing 'em.

01:32:46.693 --> 01:32:48.411
Maybe not. Look!

01:32:50.312 --> 01:32:52.314
<i>Up on the dome. It's him!</i>

01:32:52.315 --> 01:32:53.979
<i>It's the Rocketeer.</i>

01:32:59.882 --> 01:33:02.186
Go get 'em, kid.

01:33:42.024 --> 01:33:44.151
<font color=#ff00ff>- Stimmt was nicht?</font> What is wrong?
<font color=#ff00ff>- Das ruder.</font> The rudder.

01:33:44.152 --> 01:33:45.592
<font color=#ff00ff>Irgend was ist los...</font>
Something is wrong...

01:33:45.593 --> 01:33:47.188
<font color=#ff00ff>mit dem ruder hier. Lieber gott!</font>
with the rudder. Dear God!

01:33:48.989 --> 01:33:51.658
<font color=#ff00ff>Also was? Wo ist er?</font>
So what? Where is he?

01:33:51.659 --> 01:33:52.676
<font color=#ff00ff>Spinnst du, Sinclair?</font>
Are you crazy, Sinclair?

01:33:52.677 --> 01:33:54.060
<font color=#ff00ff>Was ist mit dem fraeulein da?</font>
What's with the lady?

01:33:54.061 --> 01:33:55.604
<font color=#ff00ff>Halt die fresse!</font> Keep your mouth shut!

01:33:55.905 --> 01:33:57.153
<font color=#ff00ff>Du ignorierst mich.</font>
You're ignoring me.

01:33:57.354 --> 01:34:00.244
<font color=#ff00ff>Ich habe meine stelle und du auch.</font>
I have my post and also you.

01:34:50.125 --> 01:34:54.088
Do not worry, Herr Sinclair.
My pilot is the finest in Germany.

01:34:54.089 --> 01:34:58.294
We are in very capable hands.
He will not let us down.

01:34:59.727 --> 01:35:03.399
Nooo!

01:35:12.829 --> 01:35:14.535
Lothar.

01:35:16.944 --> 01:35:19.245
<font color=#ff00ff>Das ist deine schuld!</font> This is your fault

01:35:19.246 --> 01:35:23.099
We are losing altitude.
We must drop some weight.

01:35:23.100 --> 01:35:26.989
You, you... actor!

01:35:32.683 --> 01:35:34.427
For the fatherland.

01:35:35.428 --> 01:35:36.595
<font color=#ff00ff>Ja.</font> Yes.

01:35:36.596 --> 01:35:37.559
<font color=#ff00ff>Komm!</font> Come!

01:35:39.391 --> 01:35:42.435
<font color=#ff00ff>Beeil dich! Da oben ist der mann.</font>
Hurry up! Up there is a man.

01:35:42.436 --> 01:35:44.755
<font color=#ff00ff>- Los!</font> Go!
<font color=#ff00ff>- Ja.</font> Yes.

01:35:49.084 --> 01:35:50.614
<font color=#ff00ff>Herr Sinclair...</font> Mr. Sinclair...

01:35:59.194 --> 01:36:02.338
I've had a bellyful of you
and your cheap heroics.

01:36:02.539 --> 01:36:07.293
Hand over the rocket or I'll blow
her brains... all over the cabin.

01:36:07.294 --> 01:36:10.413
No, don't give it to him. Cliff, you can't!

01:36:11.414 --> 01:36:12.835
I have to.

01:36:15.209 --> 01:36:16.664
<font color=#ff00ff>Herr kapitaen!</font> Captain Sir!

01:36:21.941 --> 01:36:23.972
Slide it.

01:36:37.048 --> 01:36:39.737
If she moves, kill her.

01:36:50.546 --> 01:36:51.564
Oww!

01:36:52.622 --> 01:36:54.751
Aaaaah!

01:36:56.168 --> 01:36:58.255
Where's your stuntman now, Sinclair?

01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:04.211
I do my own stunts.

01:37:49.537 --> 01:37:51.266
<i>Stop!</i>

01:37:52.808 --> 01:37:56.147
No! No!

01:38:08.839 --> 01:38:11.951
<i>For God's sakes, Sinclair.</i>
Help us get these flames out.

01:38:11.952 --> 01:38:17.323
Good-bye, Jenny. I wish
I could take you with me.

01:38:17.324 --> 01:38:20.167
Everything about you is a lie.

01:38:20.168 --> 01:38:25.209
It wasn't lies, Jenny. It was acting.

01:38:34.182 --> 01:38:37.285
I'll miss Hollywood.

01:38:39.786 --> 01:38:41.358
I don't think so.

01:38:50.282 --> 01:38:52.703
Aaaah!

01:39:06.206 --> 01:39:11.052
Jenny, this thing's full of hydrogen.
When the fire hits the envelope...

01:39:11.053 --> 01:39:13.849
I love you, Cliff.

01:39:43.117 --> 01:39:45.005
Run, Jenny!

01:39:48.090 --> 01:39:51.929
Steady as she goes, Howard. We're
only gonna get one pass of this.

01:40:08.610 --> 01:40:11.383
- Drop the ladder.
- Right.

01:40:15.267 --> 01:40:17.905
Jump for it, Clifford! Come on!

01:40:21.706 --> 01:40:24.112
Let's get outta here!

01:40:49.267 --> 01:40:51.945
- <i>Hi, Millie.
- Hey, morning Millie, how you doing?</i>

01:40:51.946 --> 01:40:53.592
Morning, boys.

01:40:56.992 --> 01:40:59.502
"Film fans were saddened by the news..."

01:40:59.503 --> 01:41:03.139
"that actor Neville Sinclair
was killed in the tragedy..."

01:41:03.140 --> 01:41:08.978
"when flaming debris fell on his touring
car." That's terrible. That was a nice car.

01:41:08.979 --> 01:41:12.716
You look awful blue for a guy
who pretty much saved the world.

01:41:14.317 --> 01:41:17.405
You know, I guess I got the
cracked ribs to prove it.

01:41:18.013 --> 01:41:20.151
You got me.

01:41:49.627 --> 01:41:53.239
- She's a beauty, Mr. Hughes.
- Isn't she?

01:41:53.640 --> 01:41:56.121
In another month, she'll
be ready for the nationals.

01:41:58.353 --> 01:42:00.630
Miss Blake, will you excuse
us for just a moment?

01:42:00.631 --> 01:42:02.326
Of course.

01:42:09.723 --> 01:42:13.400
I've been meaning to ask
you, what was it like...

01:42:13.401 --> 01:42:17.107
strapping that thing to your back
and flying like a bat out of hell?

01:42:19.908 --> 01:42:22.970
It was the closest I'll ever
get to heaven, Mr. Hughes.

01:42:24.171 --> 01:42:27.784
Well... maybe not.

01:42:35.382 --> 01:42:37.778
See you around, Rocketeer.

01:42:39.094 --> 01:42:43.750
Oh... don't ever fly her without this.

01:43:11.526 --> 01:43:13.168
<i>Isn't it pretty?</i>

01:43:13.169 --> 01:43:15.337
Hey, guy, I didn't even get
a chance to thank him.

01:43:15.738 --> 01:43:20.200
You don't have to, son. He
saw the look on your face.

01:43:21.001 --> 01:43:22.044
<i>Cliff,</i>

01:43:22.245 --> 01:43:23.979
I have something for you too.

01:43:23.980 --> 01:43:26.928
Actually... it's for Peevy.

01:43:29.812 --> 01:43:32.122
Oh, no!

01:43:34.023 --> 01:43:36.859
What was that line again? "Oh, my prince..."

01:43:36.860 --> 01:43:39.945
- "would that you'd drink of my lips..."
- Thanks.

01:43:39.946 --> 01:43:41.926
I don't mind if I do.

01:43:45.285 --> 01:43:47.087
Clifford, take a look at this here.

01:43:47.088 --> 01:43:50.992
Here look, I bet if we increase the
manifold pressure about %25 and...

01:43:50.993 --> 01:43:55.432
switch the fuel-to-air ratio, just
favoring the fuel just you know...

01:43:57.889 --> 01:44:00.345
Hey, Goose! You wanna take a look at here?

01:44:08.183 --> 01:44:10.955
Rocketeer to the rescue!
