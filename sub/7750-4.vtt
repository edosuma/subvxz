00:00.062 --> 00:01.968
<i>Previously
on "Devious Maids"...</i>

00:02.040 --> 00:03.834
I'm fairly certain
you're not a maid...

00:03.948 --> 00:05.265
(whispers)
and I can't wait to find out

00:05.283 --> 00:07.267
what you're really doing here.

00:07.285 --> 00:10.120
(Marisol) So Adrian Powell
hires prostitutes

00:10.154 --> 00:12.155
to have sex with his friends.

00:12.206 --> 00:15.125
Flora was also Adrian's whore.

00:15.159 --> 00:16.960
I won two "Soap Opera Digest"
awards.

00:16.994 --> 00:18.828
The fact that you think
that's impressive

00:18.880 --> 00:20.580
makes me wanna vomit
and weep for you.

00:20.614 --> 00:22.299
Have you ever thought
of leaving her?

00:22.333 --> 00:25.252
I can't.
And we've got a kid.

00:25.286 --> 00:27.304
You are such a nice man.

00:27.338 --> 00:29.723
Guess who just called me?
Benny Soto.

00:29.757 --> 00:32.092
He's a producer,
and he wants to meet with me.

00:32.125 --> 00:34.094
You've definitely
got some skills.

00:34.128 --> 00:36.629
- Well, I think we're in business.
- Oh God. (Laughs)

00:36.647 --> 00:37.847
You know, for a minute there,

00:37.899 --> 00:39.266
I really thought
this was going somewhere.

00:39.300 --> 00:41.067
Maybe we should just cool it.

00:41.102 --> 00:44.271
Boys with money
don't end up with the maid.

00:44.305 --> 00:46.156
You can't still be
holding on to that.

00:46.190 --> 00:47.691
Henri made promises to me.

00:47.742 --> 00:50.193
I remember every single
one of them.

00:50.244 --> 00:52.245
Oh, Henri. How is she?

00:52.280 --> 00:55.148
I'm worried about her.
I know she's missed you.

00:55.166 --> 00:59.502
I think it would be a good idea
if you... flew out to see her.

01:07.878 --> 01:09.546
(Sighs)

01:12.967 --> 01:14.301
How are you doing?

01:14.335 --> 01:15.769
I'm fine.

01:15.803 --> 01:17.971
Please.
You're a nervous wreck.

01:18.005 --> 01:20.173
Take this.
It'll help you relax.

01:20.191 --> 01:21.775
What is it?

01:21.809 --> 01:23.009
A Xanax.

01:23.027 --> 01:25.178
No, thanks.

01:25.196 --> 01:26.479
He's a former lover

01:26.513 --> 01:28.064
who's never seen you
with crow's-feet.

01:28.115 --> 01:29.950
You're allowed to medicate.

01:29.984 --> 01:31.785
I'm married. Henri's married.
We've moved on.

01:31.819 --> 01:35.789
<i>I don't need a pill.
And I don't have crow's-feet.</i>

01:35.823 --> 01:38.575
Mrs. Delatour, your brother's
car just pulled up.

01:40.378 --> 01:41.911
Last chance.

01:41.963 --> 01:43.880
(Object clatters)

01:50.390 --> 01:53.373
- My baby brother!
- Genevieve. Mwah.

01:53.391 --> 01:54.841
(Kisses)
Oh.

01:54.875 --> 01:56.142
Look at you.

01:56.177 --> 01:57.761
You're emaciated.

01:57.812 --> 01:59.879
You always say
the sweetest things.

01:59.897 --> 02:02.849
Oh, Henri, how long has it been
since you came to visit?

02:02.883 --> 02:05.318
Last time I was here,
you were married to Phillipe.

02:05.353 --> 02:07.103
That was three husbands ago.

02:07.154 --> 02:08.905
Well, you are more beautiful
than ever.

02:08.939 --> 02:10.223
Divorce agrees with you.

02:10.241 --> 02:11.524
That's why I keep doing it.
(Laughs)

02:11.558 --> 02:13.193
(Laughs)

02:13.227 --> 02:16.746
Now there is someone here
who'd like to say hello.

02:18.000 --> 02:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:27.074 --> 02:29.843
Thank you.

02:29.877 --> 02:31.744
For what?

02:31.762 --> 02:34.931
For staying as beautiful
as I remember.

02:34.965 --> 02:37.717
When'd you come up
with that one?

02:37.751 --> 02:39.386
On the ride in
from the airport.

02:39.420 --> 02:41.971
Did it work?
Have you forgiven me?

02:42.023 --> 02:43.139
What do you think?

02:43.190 --> 02:45.275
See, that's what
I always loved about you.

02:45.309 --> 02:47.193
You made me work for it.

02:47.228 --> 02:48.945
(Laughs)

02:48.979 --> 02:51.114
(Laughs)

02:51.148 --> 02:52.932
(Sighs)

02:52.950 --> 02:55.201
Mm.

02:57.551 --> 02:58.576
Zoila...

02:58.611 --> 03:01.176
No, this can't possibly be
your daughter.

03:01.211 --> 03:02.742
How old are you, dear, 16?

03:02.776 --> 03:05.378
Oh, it's worse than that.
She's 19.

03:06.523 --> 03:08.813
The same age you were
when we first met.

03:08.848 --> 03:11.134
So you and my mom
knew each other?

03:14.621 --> 03:16.506
Yes.

03:16.557 --> 03:18.458
They were the best of friends.

03:18.476 --> 03:22.145
And then Henri got married
and moved away.

03:22.179 --> 03:23.763
We're out of coffee.

03:23.797 --> 03:27.067
Why don't I brew us
another pot?

03:27.101 --> 03:29.235
So, Henri, you must
tell that wife of yours

03:29.270 --> 03:31.237
how furious I am with her.

03:31.272 --> 03:32.772
And why is that?

03:32.806 --> 03:35.141
Why didn't she
come out here with you?

03:35.159 --> 03:36.443
I wanted to see her.

03:36.477 --> 03:38.111
Oh, it just wasn't possible.

03:38.145 --> 03:40.113
She should've
changed her schedule.

03:40.147 --> 03:41.781
That's what you do for family.

03:41.815 --> 03:44.033
Well, you see,
that's the problem.

03:44.085 --> 03:45.818
What do you mean?

03:46.940 --> 03:49.471
Cynthia and I have decided
to get a divorce.

03:49.506 --> 03:51.174
(Dishes crash and clatter)

03:54.962 --> 04:02.563
1.04 - Making Your Bed
Sync and corrected by Elderfel
www.addic7ed.com

04:09.307 --> 04:11.739
Ms. Duarte, you can't just
go in there.

04:15.523 --> 04:17.613
Flora Hernandez
was a prostitute.

04:19.135 --> 04:20.810
I'll call you back.

04:21.071 --> 04:22.956
She took money
from Adrian Powell

04:22.990 --> 04:25.158
to have sex
with various friends of his,

04:25.192 --> 04:26.993
<i>under his roof.</i>

04:27.027 --> 04:28.194
- Really?
- Yes.

04:28.212 --> 04:29.362
And during
one of those encounters,

04:29.380 --> 04:30.530
she was raped.

04:30.548 --> 04:33.082
Raped? How do you know?

04:33.134 --> 04:34.534
I found a letter.

04:34.552 --> 04:36.202
Well, great.
Let's see it.

04:36.220 --> 04:39.235
I don't have it, and I'm pretty
sure Adrian Powell destroyed it.

04:39.984 --> 04:42.450
All right...
What about the prostitution?

04:42.523 --> 04:45.692
- Were credit cards used?
- I doubt it.

04:45.727 --> 04:48.014
So there's no paper trail.

04:48.548 --> 04:51.484
(Sighs)
No.

04:51.518 --> 04:54.687
I'm not saying what you learned
isn't valuable.

04:54.721 --> 04:56.572
Flora's character is relevant.

04:56.606 --> 05:00.409
But what we really need to know
is who wanted her dead.

05:00.444 --> 05:03.663
So I found the smoke.

05:03.697 --> 05:04.864
You need the fire.

05:04.898 --> 05:06.949
I know it's hard.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.169
You're only in the Powell house,
what, one day a week?

05:10.203 --> 05:13.756
Don't worry.
I'll figure it out.

05:13.790 --> 05:15.591
(Sighs)

05:15.625 --> 05:18.794
Marisol, when you first
told me about this plan,

05:18.845 --> 05:20.880
I thought you were crazy.

05:20.914 --> 05:22.631
But for the record,

05:22.683 --> 05:24.800
I think that what you're willing
to do for your son

05:24.851 --> 05:26.802
is extraordinary.

05:26.853 --> 05:30.556
Then you must not
have children.

05:32.526 --> 05:36.729
(Bell tolling)

05:36.763 --> 05:37.980
(Clunks)

05:38.031 --> 05:39.264
I have nothing to confess.

05:39.282 --> 05:41.233
Rosie, I know you're
a good catholic,

05:41.267 --> 05:43.786
but surely you're not
without sin?

05:43.820 --> 05:44.987
How can I sin?

05:45.038 --> 05:46.739
All I do is cook and clean

05:46.773 --> 05:48.991
and wait for my son
to come to the States.

05:49.042 --> 05:50.876
Until then, I'm a shadow.

05:50.911 --> 05:52.962
Shadows can't sin.

05:52.996 --> 05:55.047
Why did you come here?

05:55.082 --> 05:56.916
Is something troubling you?

05:56.950 --> 06:00.086
I'm worried about my boss...
Mr. Spence.

06:00.120 --> 06:01.721
He's such a good man,

06:01.755 --> 06:03.889
but he's married
to such an awful woman.

06:03.924 --> 06:06.959
<i>A bruja, padre.</i>

06:06.977 --> 06:09.729
The Bible says
that service to others

06:09.763 --> 06:11.897
is the fastest road
to happiness.

06:11.932 --> 06:13.298
Help this family,

06:13.316 --> 06:16.185
and you will no longer
be a shadow.

06:16.236 --> 06:19.522
I'll try.

06:19.573 --> 06:22.108
I just want him to be happy.

06:23.810 --> 06:25.861
Uh, Rosie...

06:25.912 --> 06:28.280
I have to ask.

06:28.314 --> 06:31.784
Are you having impure thoughts
about your boss?

06:33.837 --> 06:38.007
I told you,
I have nothing to confess.

06:38.041 --> 06:39.158
(Clunks)

06:39.176 --> 06:40.843
(Door creaks)

06:40.877 --> 06:42.094
This is the guest list.

06:42.129 --> 06:43.429
I want you to go through it

06:43.463 --> 06:45.181
and make sure we have
enough gift bags.

06:45.215 --> 06:47.166
(Latch clicks)

06:47.184 --> 06:48.968
Shakira's coming to the party?

06:49.002 --> 06:50.853
And Usher?!

06:50.887 --> 06:52.888
(Laughs)
And Courtney Love?

06:52.939 --> 06:54.140
That reminds me.

06:54.174 --> 06:56.225
We need to hide
all the breakables.

06:56.276 --> 06:57.893
Now there will be a bartender,

06:57.944 --> 06:59.311
but it's Sam's day off,

06:59.345 --> 07:01.864
so you'll have to serve
by yourself, and that...

07:01.898 --> 07:03.532
What's wrong?

07:03.567 --> 07:06.786
Benny Soto is coming?

07:06.820 --> 07:08.020
Yes. So?

07:08.038 --> 07:10.873
So I just signed with Benny.
He's my new manager.

07:10.907 --> 07:12.691
He must be down on his luck.

07:12.709 --> 07:14.743
I'll get him an extra gift bag.

07:14.795 --> 07:17.797
No, you don't understand.
I can't work this party.

07:17.831 --> 07:19.381
Why not?

07:19.416 --> 07:20.800
I can't let my new manager
see me in an apron,

07:20.834 --> 07:22.134
handing out shrimp cocktail.

07:22.169 --> 07:24.086
That would be humiliating.

07:24.137 --> 07:26.088
Wouldn't it be more humiliating
to lose your job

07:26.139 --> 07:28.057
and end up in the gutter?

07:28.091 --> 07:29.341
Why are you being so mean?

07:29.375 --> 07:31.760
I am doing my job,
and I need you to do yours.

07:31.812 --> 07:32.928
Hey, hey.

07:32.979 --> 07:34.513
What's going on in here?

07:34.547 --> 07:37.817
Alejandro, did you ever
listen to my demo?

07:37.851 --> 07:40.186
Ah, no. I'm sorry, hon.
I haven't gotten around to it.

07:40.220 --> 07:41.770
Well, I got a manager
out of it.

07:41.822 --> 07:42.905
Benny Soto.
(Laughs)

07:42.939 --> 07:44.223
And he's coming to your party.

07:44.241 --> 07:46.058
- Benny's reppin' you?
- Yeah.

07:46.076 --> 07:48.194
Wow. You must be good.

07:48.228 --> 07:49.662
Well, he doesn't know
I'm a maid.

07:49.696 --> 07:52.781
And I will die
if I have to wait on him.

07:52.833 --> 07:55.067
Okay, I get it. You don't
have to work the party.

07:55.085 --> 07:56.735
But i-it's tomorrow.

07:56.753 --> 07:58.754
It's too late to hire
someone else.

07:58.788 --> 07:59.955
Well, you could do it.

08:00.006 --> 08:01.207
Me?

08:01.241 --> 08:03.092
But I'm the house manager.

08:03.126 --> 08:05.127
I don't serve.

08:05.178 --> 08:06.679
Well, it's just this once.

08:06.713 --> 08:09.348
Our girl's in a bind.
Gotta help her out.

08:09.382 --> 08:11.934
Right?

08:11.968 --> 08:14.436
As you wish.

08:17.023 --> 08:18.691
Thank you so much.

08:18.725 --> 08:19.925
I'm so grateful.

08:19.943 --> 08:21.143
You know,
everyone coming to this party

08:21.194 --> 08:22.427
is in the music industry.

08:22.445 --> 08:24.263
Would you like to join us
and hang out?

08:24.281 --> 08:25.931
As a guest?

08:25.949 --> 08:28.067
Oh, my God. I'd love to.
(Laughs)

08:28.101 --> 08:29.702
(Chuckles)
Great.

08:29.736 --> 08:31.603
Wear something pretty.

08:31.621 --> 08:35.073
Thank you so much!

08:47.888 --> 08:49.255
Pablo!

08:49.289 --> 08:52.091
Huh?

08:52.125 --> 08:54.793
<i>(TV continues

08:54.811 --> 08:57.296
Why haven't you changed
the light blub in the pantry?

08:57.314 --> 08:59.765
Uh, we're out of light bulbs.

08:59.799 --> 09:01.183
Then go to the store.

09:01.234 --> 09:02.968
Okay.

09:02.986 --> 09:04.403
<i>(TV continues

09:04.437 --> 09:06.638
Well?

09:06.656 --> 09:08.140
(Chuckles)
What, do you mean now?

09:08.158 --> 09:10.142
I'm watching the game.

09:10.160 --> 09:12.361
<i>God forbid I should come
before fútbol.</i>

09:14.698 --> 09:16.699
<i>(TV continues

09:16.750 --> 09:18.701
What's with your mother?

09:18.752 --> 09:20.986
Something happened
at work today?

09:21.004 --> 09:22.421
Not really.

09:22.455 --> 09:26.175
Except... Mrs. Delatour's
brother came for a visit.

09:26.209 --> 09:27.993
Henri?

09:28.011 --> 09:29.962
Ohh.

09:29.996 --> 09:31.347
You know him?

09:31.381 --> 09:32.664
No.

09:32.682 --> 09:34.333
But your mother used to
date him.

09:34.351 --> 09:36.352
Date him?

09:36.386 --> 09:38.721
She never told me that.

09:38.772 --> 09:42.808
Have I told you about
all of my ex-girlfriends?

09:42.842 --> 09:45.110
Okay, there was only one,
but still.

09:45.145 --> 09:48.030
<i>Were mami and Henri serious?</i>

09:48.064 --> 09:50.149
For a while.

09:50.183 --> 09:52.484
But it ended badly.

09:52.518 --> 09:57.072
And... it doesn't bother you
he's back?

09:57.123 --> 09:59.325
Why would it?

09:59.359 --> 10:02.328
<i>(TV continues
playing indistinctly)</i>

10:04.715 --> 10:07.574
As you know, I'm on the board
of the Bootstrap Council.

10:07.717 --> 10:10.336
Okay, it's a charity
that helps at-risk youth

10:10.370 --> 10:12.037
in the inner city...

10:12.055 --> 10:13.339
Can we skip the sad statistics

10:13.373 --> 10:15.207
and get to the part
where I write you a check?

10:15.225 --> 10:16.809
It's not gonna be that easy
this year, Adrian.

10:16.843 --> 10:18.310
We're two days away
from our annual gala,

10:18.345 --> 10:20.212
and our host begged off.

10:20.230 --> 10:22.231
I was hoping you'd step in.

10:22.265 --> 10:23.232
But I hate fundraisers.

10:23.266 --> 10:24.733
Ohh.

10:24.768 --> 10:26.485
And how can I leave early
if it's in my house?

10:26.519 --> 10:28.053
(Chuckles)

10:28.071 --> 10:29.938
Your drink.

10:29.990 --> 10:32.324
Marisol, my old friend here is
becoming a callous conservative.

10:32.359 --> 10:35.778
Tell him that your people
need our help.

10:35.829 --> 10:37.446
My people...

10:37.497 --> 10:39.231
can take care of themselves.

10:39.249 --> 10:41.566
Mr. Powell,

10:41.584 --> 10:43.952
I know your wife is away
visiting her mother.

10:44.004 --> 10:45.838
So if you need an extra set
of hands for the gala,

10:45.872 --> 10:47.373
I'd be happy to help out.

10:47.407 --> 10:50.259
We'd love that.
Wouldn't we, Dante?

10:50.293 --> 10:52.845
Absolutely.

10:52.879 --> 10:54.263
Great.

10:54.297 --> 10:56.265
I look forward to it.

11:00.721 --> 11:01.771
She's fantastic.

11:01.805 --> 11:03.022
(Whispers)
I told you.

11:03.056 --> 11:05.358
Does she like to play?
Not sure.

11:05.392 --> 11:08.027
I've dropped hints, but so far,
Marisol has shown no interest

11:08.061 --> 11:10.095
in our
extracurricular activities.

11:10.113 --> 11:12.281
Well, can't we offer
our usual inducements?

11:12.316 --> 11:14.734
We could,
but don't get your hopes up.

11:14.768 --> 11:18.538
I have a horrible feeling
that this one is impenetrable.

11:18.572 --> 11:19.906
Well, you forget

11:19.940 --> 11:22.792
that I work with the poor
and disadvantaged.

11:22.826 --> 11:24.994
They all have a price.

11:25.045 --> 11:27.580
And usually, it's a bargain.

11:29.550 --> 11:31.751
(Clinks)
(Chuckles)

11:32.839 --> 11:35.844
You are the cutest
little baby in baby town. Mwah.

11:36.190 --> 11:37.941
I'm gonna pass you off,
all right?

11:37.975 --> 11:39.776
We're due on the red carpet
in 20 minutes.

11:39.810 --> 11:41.478
Why aren't you dressed?

11:41.496 --> 11:44.314
Oh, Tucker sent back
his dinner.

11:44.332 --> 11:46.483
You were feeding him
in a Gucci shirt?

11:46.501 --> 11:47.868
Are you insane?

11:47.919 --> 11:49.652
Relax.
I'll wear my black shirt.

11:49.670 --> 11:51.755
The one you bought at the mall?

11:51.789 --> 11:54.508
It'll be under a jacket.
No one will even see it.

11:54.542 --> 11:55.825
This is why you are number two

11:55.843 --> 11:57.994
on the "US Weekly"
worst-dressed list.

11:58.012 --> 11:59.963
Well, thank God
for Whoopi Goldberg.

11:59.997 --> 12:01.681
Please wear something
with a label.

12:01.716 --> 12:03.183
The press will be there,

12:03.217 --> 12:05.135
and someone may point
a camera at you by accident.

12:05.169 --> 12:08.522
Okay, turn it down, Peri.
I get it.

12:08.556 --> 12:10.390
I am a film actress now.

12:10.441 --> 12:12.476
And I'm trying
to create an image...

12:12.510 --> 12:14.895
stylish, cool, A-list.

12:14.946 --> 12:16.480
Do you know
how hard that is to do

12:16.514 --> 12:17.981
when I'm married to a...

12:23.488 --> 12:24.821
What?

12:26.023 --> 12:27.741
Nothing.

12:27.792 --> 12:31.995
Finish... that...
sentence.

12:33.697 --> 12:37.467
(Crying)

12:37.502 --> 12:39.586
Oh, no.

12:39.637 --> 12:41.338
I think the baby is hungry.

12:41.372 --> 12:43.673
Do you want to feed him,
Mrs. Peri?

12:43.707 --> 12:45.058
(Crying continues)

12:45.093 --> 12:48.645
When I'm in Alexander McQueen,
he gets the bottle.

12:48.679 --> 12:50.730
(Continues crying)

12:50.765 --> 12:53.266
Wear whatever you want.

12:53.317 --> 12:55.435
I no longer care.

12:55.486 --> 12:57.437
(Continues crying)

12:57.488 --> 12:59.523
Shh.

12:59.557 --> 13:02.409
(Continues crying)

13:22.847 --> 13:25.465
(Switch clicks)

13:55.830 --> 13:58.048
Morning, Mr. Spence.

13:58.082 --> 13:59.782
Hey.

13:59.800 --> 14:00.783
How was the premiere?

14:00.801 --> 14:02.952
Oh, it was great.

14:02.970 --> 14:04.287
When Peri got out of the limo,

14:04.305 --> 14:05.672
the fans
were screaming her name.

14:05.723 --> 14:07.807
Sounds exciting.

14:07.842 --> 14:09.342
It was.

14:09.393 --> 14:11.928
She's really becoming
a big deal.

14:11.962 --> 14:14.981
Did you sleep out here?

14:16.467 --> 14:18.602
Yeah.

14:18.636 --> 14:20.103
Hey, uh,

14:20.137 --> 14:21.655
Peri invited a bunch of people
from her movie

14:21.689 --> 14:23.490
over for game night on Friday.

14:23.524 --> 14:25.808
She wanted me to tell you that
we needed wine and cheese.

14:25.826 --> 14:27.444
I'll take care of it.

14:27.478 --> 14:29.613
Thank you.

14:30.915 --> 14:33.783
Mr. Spence, are you okay?

14:36.003 --> 14:38.121
It's funny.
(Exhales)

14:38.155 --> 14:40.123
They say fame is like
a magnifying glass.

14:40.157 --> 14:42.709
It makes you a bigger version
of who you are.

14:42.760 --> 14:44.594
If this movie's a hit,

14:44.629 --> 14:47.430
Peri's just gonna get worse.

14:47.465 --> 14:48.765
<i>Ay!</i>

14:48.799 --> 14:49.883
Yeah.
(Chuckles)

14:49.934 --> 14:51.384
Look who I'm talking to.

14:51.435 --> 14:53.136
You get it
almost as bad as I do.

14:53.170 --> 14:55.505
But I never really listen
to her.

14:55.523 --> 14:57.891
Yeah?
How's that possible?

14:57.942 --> 15:02.028
When she starts in,
I just go someplace in my head.

15:02.063 --> 15:03.947
I dream of Miguel

15:03.981 --> 15:05.982
and the day I'll hold him again

15:06.016 --> 15:08.401
and hear him call me "mama."

15:08.452 --> 15:11.821
When I think of that,
I can't hear a word she says.

15:11.855 --> 15:13.823
That must be nice.

15:13.857 --> 15:15.458
You can do it, too.

15:15.493 --> 15:16.993
When she starts in,

15:17.027 --> 15:19.579
you just have to think of
something that makes you happy.

15:19.630 --> 15:23.550
What do you dream of,
Mr. Spence?

15:25.086 --> 15:27.504
What a good question.

15:38.733 --> 15:41.651
What do you want, Spanish?

15:41.686 --> 15:45.188
I wanted to thank you for...
for working the party.

15:45.222 --> 15:48.391
I-I know you don't usually
do that kind of thing.

15:48.409 --> 15:51.444
I'm doing it for Alejandro,
not you.

15:51.495 --> 15:54.397
Well, I know I owe you one,
so I came to tell you,

15:54.415 --> 15:57.951
i-if you ever need anything,
a favor,

15:58.002 --> 16:01.621
all you have to do is ask.

16:01.672 --> 16:04.574
There is one thing.

16:04.592 --> 16:08.211
Okay. Name it.

16:09.964 --> 16:11.931
Don't go to the party.

16:11.966 --> 16:13.550
What?

16:13.584 --> 16:15.685
Ten years,
I work for Alejandro.

16:15.720 --> 16:20.557
Never once has he
invited me to a party.

16:20.591 --> 16:23.526
(Voice breaks) I do so much
for him, but he never...

16:23.561 --> 16:25.362
Odessa?

16:25.396 --> 16:28.148
You are the maid.
I am your superior.

16:28.199 --> 16:30.650
It's bad enough I have to
wait on Alejandro's friends.

16:30.701 --> 16:33.403
I should not have to serve you.

16:33.437 --> 16:35.538
Okay, I totally get
what you're saying.

16:35.573 --> 16:37.707
It's just...

16:37.742 --> 16:39.075
Just what?

16:40.944 --> 16:43.713
Can I tell you a secret?

16:43.748 --> 16:47.717
Next Monday is my birthday.
I'm turning 37.

16:47.752 --> 16:50.970
That is old
for the music business.

16:51.005 --> 16:54.090
I'm running out of time.

16:54.124 --> 16:55.558
And the people at this party,

16:55.593 --> 16:58.511
they can really help me
get my career started.

16:58.562 --> 17:01.481
I mean, do... do you see
why this is so important?

17:05.135 --> 17:07.237
You said all I had to do
was ask.

17:07.271 --> 17:09.521
(Closes laptop)

17:09.573 --> 17:12.192
I have asked.

17:15.945 --> 17:17.946
(Sighs)

17:17.981 --> 17:20.617
So the question is,

17:20.651 --> 17:23.586
do you really want
Odessa as a friend?

17:23.621 --> 17:24.788
Hell, no.

17:24.821 --> 17:26.823
But I don't want her
as my enemy.

17:26.840 --> 17:28.491
You have to go to that party.

17:28.509 --> 17:30.627
It could help you be a star.

17:30.661 --> 17:31.928
Then it's settled.

17:31.962 --> 17:33.663
I'm going to the party
and enjoy myself.

17:33.681 --> 17:34.831
(Squeals)

17:34.849 --> 17:35.832
Good for you.

17:35.850 --> 17:37.934
(Chuckles)

17:37.968 --> 17:40.186
Marisol, are you okay?

17:40.221 --> 17:42.188
Yeah, I'm fine.

17:42.223 --> 17:44.774
I just... I have something
on my mind.

17:44.809 --> 17:45.942
What is it?

17:45.976 --> 17:50.313
When Flora was killed,
was she pregnant?

17:51.782 --> 17:54.200
Why?

17:54.235 --> 17:55.735
I was cleaning
her room yesterday,

17:55.786 --> 17:57.520
and I found a pregnancy test.

17:57.538 --> 17:59.706
How is that
any of your business?

17:59.740 --> 18:01.291
It was just a question.

18:01.325 --> 18:03.042
Well, I'm getting sick
of your questions.

18:03.077 --> 18:04.544
(Speaks Spanish)

18:04.578 --> 18:07.630
Come on, guys.
We were having fun.

18:07.665 --> 18:09.999
From the moment she got here,
she's been asking about Flora.

18:10.033 --> 18:13.052
Why? She was our friend,
not yours.

18:13.087 --> 18:14.888
I thought this was important.

18:14.922 --> 18:17.807
I thought it was something
the police might want to know.

18:17.842 --> 18:19.058
<i>Basta.</i>

18:19.093 --> 18:21.344
We don't talk about Flora
anymore.

18:24.315 --> 18:25.815
Why can't we talk about Flora?

18:25.850 --> 18:27.100
Rosie.

18:27.151 --> 18:29.102
She's dead.
What does it matter?

18:29.153 --> 18:30.887
Because we all promised.

18:30.905 --> 18:33.907
I'm tired of protecting her.

18:33.941 --> 18:35.191
Yes.

18:36.894 --> 18:38.227
Flora was pregnant.

18:38.245 --> 18:40.697
She told me the last time
I talked to her.

18:40.731 --> 18:43.416
Do you know who the father was?

18:44.785 --> 18:46.068
No.

18:46.086 --> 18:48.070
We just knew he was a rich guy.

18:48.088 --> 18:49.756
How did you know that?

18:49.790 --> 18:51.741
That's what she wanted,

18:51.759 --> 18:53.576
to have a millionaire's baby.

18:53.594 --> 18:55.795
And then milk him
for everything he was worth.

18:55.846 --> 18:57.297
That was her plan.

18:58.749 --> 19:00.133
And you all knew this?

19:04.188 --> 19:07.056
We told her it was wrong.

19:08.392 --> 19:11.227
But Flora didn't care.

19:27.730 --> 19:29.481
You know we need to talk,
right?

19:29.532 --> 19:31.116
Do we?

19:31.151 --> 19:33.285
(Chuckles)
Come on, Zoila.

19:33.319 --> 19:35.154
You heard about my divorce.

19:35.205 --> 19:37.039
Yeah. It's a shame.

19:37.073 --> 19:38.940
I got all your Christmas cards.
She's very photogenic.

19:38.958 --> 19:41.076
I hope she doesn't take
all your money.

19:41.110 --> 19:42.244
Really?

19:42.278 --> 19:44.997
That's all
you have to say to me?

19:45.048 --> 19:48.167
You have something
in your teeth.

19:48.218 --> 19:50.052
Now I'm done.

19:50.086 --> 19:51.336
(Laughs)

19:51.387 --> 19:53.622
<i>Allez-venez...</i>

19:53.640 --> 19:56.791
Have lunch with me.

19:56.810 --> 19:59.261
There's so many things
I have to say.

19:59.295 --> 20:01.730
Like what?

20:01.764 --> 20:03.765
Well, for starters,
I'd like to apologize

20:03.799 --> 20:06.268
for what happened 20 years ago.

20:09.656 --> 20:11.473
Do you remember
that little restaurant

20:11.491 --> 20:13.242
you used to take me to?

20:13.276 --> 20:14.610
Yeah.

20:14.644 --> 20:17.112
(Giggles) I want to go
someplace nicer.

20:20.416 --> 20:22.284
(Huffs)

20:27.156 --> 20:29.174
(Clears throat)
Mrs. Delatour,

20:29.209 --> 20:31.543
do you have a moment?

20:31.594 --> 20:34.296
For you? Absolutely.
What's up?

20:38.601 --> 20:40.969
I need to know...
everything that happened

20:41.003 --> 20:44.022
between my mother
and your brother.

20:48.177 --> 20:51.730
You might want
to pull up a chair.

20:57.403 --> 21:01.490
(Indistinct conversations)

21:20.260 --> 21:24.897
You see, I-I thought about it,
and I just felt that it...

21:43.416 --> 21:44.616
Flora Hernandez
was not pregnant

21:44.667 --> 21:46.084
at the time of her death.

21:46.119 --> 21:48.253
Are you absolutely sure?

21:48.288 --> 21:49.755
It's all there
in the coroner's report,

21:49.789 --> 21:51.840
and he performed
the autopsy himself.

21:51.874 --> 21:53.508
Could she have terminated
the pregnancy?

21:53.543 --> 21:55.510
I didn't have time
to ask a lot of questions.

21:55.545 --> 21:57.763
Oh. The coroner was on his
way to some appointment,

21:57.797 --> 22:00.081
but he was quite insistent.

22:00.099 --> 22:01.717
Wait.
What does this mean?

22:03.469 --> 22:04.853
Huh.

22:04.887 --> 22:07.723
This has been revised.

22:15.097 --> 22:16.398
He's a friend
of Adrian Powell's.

22:16.432 --> 22:17.866
I don't want him
to recognize me.

22:17.900 --> 22:20.235
That man is a friend
of Adrian Powell's?

22:20.269 --> 22:22.371
Yeah. You know him?

22:22.405 --> 22:25.574
(Sighs)

22:25.608 --> 22:27.909
He's the coroner.

22:30.780 --> 22:33.465
We need to get a copy
of the original report.

the one that got away.

26:29.869 --> 26:31.903
And I blamed myself.

26:31.954 --> 26:35.874
I thought, "I wasn't
good enough for him."

26:35.908 --> 26:38.693
Well, how about that?

26:38.711 --> 26:40.412

He's very fond of her.

right now.

none of your business.

28:19.128 --> 28:20.979

Yeah. I guess so.

for a little kindness,

33:13.573 --> 33:16.441
I can offer
tremendous compensation.

33:16.459 --> 33:18.276
Thank you.

33:18.294 --> 33:19.461
No.

33:19.496 --> 33:21.113

33:21.131 --> 33:24.133
I'm in a position
to change your life.

33:24.167 --> 33:26.385
I'd prefer if you just...

33:26.419 --> 33:28.137
change your outfit.

33:28.171 --> 33:29.421
No, thanks.
(Thuds)

33:29.455 --> 33:32.791
It's a little hot in here,

33:32.809 --> 33:36.261
How are you not embarrassed
right now?

33:36.295 --> 33:40.516
Because this is how
the world works.

33:40.567 --> 33:43.902
If you take one more step,
I will hit you.

33:43.937 --> 33:45.687
I should warn you,

33:45.739 --> 33:49.024
I find resistance
to be very arousing.

33:49.075 --> 33:52.244
You have ten seconds
to get out of my way.

33:52.278 --> 33:53.495
Or what?

Hey.

This is Spence,
my... husband.

Hey, Spence. I'm Lois.
Hey.

36:01.661 --> 36:02.911
Why do you look so familiar?

36:02.962 --> 36:04.496
Oh, I'm an actor.

36:04.530 --> 36:06.464
I play Dr. Lance Dupree
on "Love Affairs."

36:06.499 --> 36:09.200
Perhaps you've caught it
if you've ever stayed home sick

36:09.218 --> 36:12.387
or accidentally left the TV on.

36:12.421 --> 36:15.390

And so the games begin.

- Thank you.
- Thank you, Rosie.

without her. (Chuckles)

Mr. Cody here.

You also... you know.

Come on, Spence.
This isn't helping.

37:20.740 --> 37:22.240
Do something else.
