WEBVTT

00:04.854 --> 00:06.156
(hank)
huh?

00:06.156 --> 00:08.157
"new york style deli"?

00:08.157 --> 00:10.160
They think that's
a selling point?

00:10.660 --> 00:14.164
Wow! They've got pictures
of celebrities on the walls.

00:17.250 --> 00:18.752
Howie mandel.

00:18.752 --> 00:20.170
[hank sighs]

00:22.172 --> 00:23.673
what's a k-nish?

00:23.673 --> 00:25.542
Honey, it's
pronounced "nish."

00:26.042 --> 00:29.045
The "k" is silent,
and I have no idea.

00:29.546 --> 00:32.265
Stuffed kishkes?
Kreplach?

00:32.265 --> 00:35.385
Even in my dreams,
i--I never dreamed a place

00:35.385 --> 00:38.188
like the show biz deli
could exist.

00:38.188 --> 00:40.724
It's food
with a punch line.

00:41.274 --> 00:42.275
Tongue?

00:42.275 --> 00:44.277
They're trying to feed us
all the animal parts

00:44.277 --> 00:46.029
they're supposed
to throw away.

00:46.529 --> 00:47.530
Let's go.

00:47.530 --> 00:48.398
Fine.

00:50.400 --> 00:54.404
Dad, can I at least go
to the bathroom before we go?

00:54.404 --> 00:55.538
Uh, all right.

00:58.324 --> 00:59.826
[dishes clinking]

00:59.826 --> 01:01.211
[clears throat]

01:01.211 --> 01:03.663
put a louie anderson
in a bag to go.

01:03.663 --> 01:06.549
I'll leave the money
on the hand drier.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:41.000 --> 01:43.503
Hey, bobby, here's
your teen peopleback.

01:43.503 --> 01:45.004
You were right.

01:45.004 --> 01:47.507
Neve campbell really
likes rock climbing.

01:47.507 --> 01:48.508
Hey, sharise,

01:48.508 --> 01:50.510
looks like you
dropped something.

01:51.010 --> 01:53.012
Way to be in 2nd grade, craphead.

01:55.598 --> 01:58.885
I have tried tripping her,
I've hid her lunch.

01:58.885 --> 02:02.305
I'm running out
of ways to show he
r that I like her.

02:02.305 --> 02:05.692
I assume you tried throwing
utility balls at her head.

02:06.192 --> 02:07.694
I can't ask he
r to the dance

02:07.694 --> 02:09.529
unless I know
she likes me.

02:09.529 --> 02:10.864
God, you're lucky.

02:11.364 --> 02:13.366
Connie likes you.
So after the dance
,

02:13.366 --> 02:15.285
you know you'r
e getting a kiss
.

02:15.285 --> 02:17.120
and then you'll have
a girlfriend.

02:17.570 --> 02:19.155
And then I'll be
your nerdy friend

02:19.656 --> 02:21.658
who doesn't
have a girlfriend.

02:21.658 --> 02:24.661
I'm gonna go whack sharise
in the butt with a shovel.

02:24.994 --> 02:27.497
(bobby)
see, connie wants to go
to this dance.

02:27.997 --> 02:31.334
Oh, your first
middle-school dance.

02:31.334 --> 02:33.169
How romantic.

02:33.169 --> 02:36.139
You'll hold each other close
and move in a circle

02:36.139 --> 02:38.007
over and over again,

02:38.474 --> 02:40.977
and then if she doesn't
pass out drunk on you, well,

02:40.977 --> 02:44.647
then the night will end
in a clumsy, slobbery kiss
.

02:44.647 --> 02:46.149
about that kiss...

02:46.149 --> 02:48.017
Oh, it'll be magical.

02:48.017 --> 02:49.986
Nothing will ever
be the same

02:49.986 --> 02:52.355
between you and connie
ever again.

02:52.355 --> 02:55.825
You know, connie and I
practice-kissed once already

02:55.825 --> 02:57.327
and nothing changed.

02:57.327 --> 03:00.747
.
Yeah. But this is
a middle-school dance kiss

03:00.747 --> 03:03.032
this is a real kiss.

03:03.333 --> 03:05.335
Remember marie?
I kissed her

03:05.835 --> 03:09.005
and then things got
really complicated
and she dumped me.

03:09.505 --> 03:12.008
I thought the pain
would never go away.

03:12.008 --> 03:13.509
That was a real kiss.

03:17.597 --> 03:18.598
[chomping]

03:20.350 --> 03:21.267
[sighing]

03:22.886 --> 03:24.888
so you really like
the chopped chicken liver.

03:24.888 --> 03:28.725
I love it! It's meat
I can eat with a spoon.

03:28.725 --> 03:30.693
I get it in a drum
from a catalog.

03:31.194 --> 03:33.863
.
It's a lot easier
than italian food
like my last place

03:33.863 --> 03:38.034
did you know you have
to heat up italian food?

03:38.034 --> 03:40.703
Well, you gotta melt
the cheese.

03:42.205 --> 03:44.207
You know,
i'm feeling a lot better.

03:44.707 --> 03:47.210
I think I will have
that herring plate
after all.

03:47.210 --> 03:48.661
Attaboy!

03:48.661 --> 03:50.380
.
I thought I was gonna
have to throw that out

03:51.130 --> 03:52.498
oh, yeah!

03:52.498 --> 03:53.499
Peggy?
huh?

03:53.499 --> 03:56.469
g
Look, I got an invitation
to some kind of art openin

03:56.469 --> 03:58.838
at the dallas museum
of modern art.

03:58.838 --> 04:00.640
Now, either dale's
pulling a prank

04:01.007 --> 04:03.509
or you've been
sending money to p.b.s. Again.

04:03.509 --> 04:05.895
Not me. They have
not got a penny

04:05.895 --> 04:08.514
since their cheap mug
cut my lip.

04:08.514 --> 04:11.768
On the other hand,
maybe it would be fun
to go to an art opening.

04:11.768 --> 04:15.571
There'd be new,
not-dale-bill-boomhaue
r people to talk to.

04:15.571 --> 04:17.072
There might
even be dancing.

04:17.072 --> 04:18.156
Dancing?

04:18.156 --> 04:19.659
Oh, bobby, that reminds me.

04:19.659 --> 04:22.161
Connie's mom and I
are trying to coordinate
dropping you guys off

04:22.161 --> 04:23.162
at your middle-school dance.

04:23.663 --> 04:25.164
Now, they can fit 8
in their minivan.

04:25.665 --> 04:27.166
Do you know
if sharise's hip is healed?

04:27.667 --> 04:30.003
Yeah, I think so.
I gotta go.

04:30.003 --> 04:31.337
Where are you
off to, son?

04:31.754 --> 04:32.755
To the mall.

04:32.755 --> 04:34.757
You know, where, um,

04:34.757 --> 04:38.094
all those sports field
s are near.

04:38.511 --> 04:41.514
I tell you what,
bobby sure has
gotten active lately.

04:41.514 --> 04:43.016
No, hank, I think
something's wrong.

04:43.016 --> 04:44.517
He's not eating
his supper.

04:45.018 --> 04:46.019
And you saw
what just happened

04:46.019 --> 04:48.021
when I tried to talk
to him about the dance.

04:48.021 --> 04:50.523
y
A 12-year-old boy
running off to pla

04:50.523 --> 04:53.359
rather than talk
about prom dresses
with his mom

04:53.860 --> 04:55.778
sounds pretty normal
to me.

04:56.779 --> 04:58.781
Normal. What do you know.

05:01.734 --> 05:03.319
[moans]

05:05.154 --> 05:07.156
so then... Bobby?

05:07.156 --> 05:08.958
?
You want me
to slow down some more

05:09.876 --> 05:10.877
[groaning]

05:14.213 --> 05:17.550
so, anyway, maybe you and
I could go to the dance,

05:18.551 --> 05:20.136
if you want.

05:20.136 --> 05:23.139
Uh, that sure sounds
like fun, connie,

05:23.139 --> 05:26.259
but I'm not certain
i'm 100 percent.

05:26.259 --> 05:28.261
I think I stubbed my toe.

05:28.261 --> 05:30.680
That's why I'm wearing
my mom's tennis shoes.

05:31.097 --> 05:32.899
Your toe will be bette
r by next week.

05:33.182 --> 05:35.184
Or it could be worse.

05:35.184 --> 05:38.187
I only know that
i'll be praying for it
to get better,

05:38.187 --> 05:40.189
so we can go
to the dance.

05:40.189 --> 05:43.076
But praying
usually doesn't work.

05:43.076 --> 05:44.027
[bobby groans]

05:44.027 --> 05:45.028
[sighs]

05:49.365 --> 05:53.119
oh, thank god,
there'll be ice again!

05:53.119 --> 05:54.504
[phone ringing]

05:56.789 --> 05:59.175
.
luanne!
I could use a hand

05:59.175 --> 06:01.677
(luanne)
now you put it
in the freezer.

06:03.679 --> 06:04.680
[sighs]

06:04.680 --> 06:06.182
[mumbles]

06:06.766 --> 06:08.267
what is it?

06:08.267 --> 06:09.769
(woman on phone)
mr. Hill,

06:09.769 --> 06:11.771
i'm calling
from the dallas museum
of modern art.

06:11.771 --> 06:13.773
Did you receive the invitation
to the opening?

06:14.273 --> 06:17.276
Yes, and when I threw it out,
I thought you'd get the idea.

06:17.777 --> 06:19.779
Very well.
If you do decide to attend,

06:19.779 --> 06:20.780
your parking is free

06:20.780 --> 06:22.782
since your photograph
is in the exhibit.

06:23.282 --> 06:25.785
My photograph?
What photograph?

06:25.785 --> 06:27.787
I don't know.
I work for the catering.

06:28.287 --> 06:30.206
We just need to know
how much cheese to buy.

06:30.206 --> 06:32.125
How many people?
60.

06:32.125 --> 06:33.709
8 pounds.

06:33.709 --> 06:36.712
Bobby, what did I tell you
about the funny walks?

06:36.712 --> 06:38.214
"
"not in the house.

06:38.214 --> 06:40.216
But this isn't
a funny walk.

06:40.216 --> 06:41.968
My toe really hurts.

06:42.301 --> 06:43.086
Your big toe?

06:43.386 --> 06:44.387
Uh-huh.

06:44.387 --> 06:45.171
hmm.

06:45.555 --> 06:47.056
Bobby, now listen to me.

06:47.056 --> 06:49.559
Put yourself
in a 3-point stance.

06:50.843 --> 06:53.262
From football, bobby,
before the snap.

06:53.763 --> 06:54.564
Oh, yeah.

06:54.931 --> 06:56.315
[groaning]

06:56.315 --> 06:57.817
[yells]

06:57.817 --> 07:00.853
bobby, it looks like
all that activity
you've been up to

07:00.853 --> 07:02.355
has finally caught up
with you.

07:02.355 --> 07:03.940
You've got turf toe.

07:03.940 --> 07:05.324
What do I do about it?

07:05.775 --> 07:07.110
Well, you play through
the pain.

07:07.527 --> 07:11.030
And I get to take you
to the heimlich county
sports medicine center.

07:11.030 --> 07:11.914
[laughs]

07:12.365 --> 07:15.368
we can laugh at all the people
with tennis elbow.

07:20.840 --> 07:23.342
Excuse me, sir,
did you throw out
your elbow

07:23.342 --> 07:24.844
playing golf
or tennis?

07:24.844 --> 07:26.345
Tennis.

07:26.345 --> 07:28.181
[both snickering]

07:28.181 --> 07:30.633
.
you know, bobby,
we gave you
a dumb middle name

07:30.633 --> 07:34.387
bobby hill, Dr. Tannenbaum
is ready to see you.

07:34.387 --> 07:35.888
Now, you 2 go ahead.

07:35.888 --> 07:39.308
I'll be here until midnigh
t filling out these
endless damn h.m.o. Forms.

07:39.809 --> 07:42.979
Oh, shoot! I put bobby dow
n as my own father.

07:42.979 --> 07:44.814
!
Oh, damn these h.m.o.s

07:47.817 --> 07:49.202
so what's it
gonna be, doctor?

07:49.652 --> 07:52.155
Whirlpool,
deep-heat massage?

07:52.155 --> 07:53.656
Or are you just
gonna tell my son

07:53.656 --> 07:56.792
to play through the pain,
'cause I'll support that.

07:56.792 --> 07:58.294
None of that
will be necessary.

07:58.294 --> 08:01.330
According to the blood test,
your boy here has gout.

08:01.330 --> 08:02.165
Gout?

08:02.665 --> 08:03.666
i...

08:03.666 --> 08:04.667
[moaning]

08:06.419 --> 08:08.921
guess who filled out
all the forms?

08:08.921 --> 08:10.923
[imitating fat albert]
hey, hey, hey!

08:10.923 --> 08:11.924
[laughs]

08:17.563 --> 08:19.015
well, gout occurs

08:19.015 --> 08:21.350
when uric acid crystals form
in the bloodstream

08:21.350 --> 08:23.319
and collect
in an extremity.

08:23.319 --> 08:24.904
Like bobby's big toe.

08:24.904 --> 08:28.908
Now, hold on. Maybe turf toe
was a pipe dream, but gout?

08:28.908 --> 08:31.027
That's an
old man's disease.

08:31.027 --> 08:32.528
Hey, I'm not gonna
tell you it's normal

08:33.029 --> 08:35.530
for a 12-year-old boy
to get gout,

08:35.530 --> 08:37.033
.
but it happens

08:37.033 --> 08:39.669
like that feral boy
they found surviving
on pig excrement.

08:40.169 --> 08:42.171
What you need to do
is quit pumping your boy

08:42.171 --> 08:43.172
full of
purine-rich foods.

08:43.172 --> 08:45.174
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

08:45.925 --> 08:47.176
And those are?

08:47.176 --> 08:50.179
Preserved fish
like anchovies or herrings

08:50.179 --> 08:52.682
and organ meats, you know,
kidneys, hearts, liver.

08:53.182 --> 08:55.968
The boy's not a ghoul.
He doesn't eat that stuff.

08:56.385 --> 08:58.888
Is there liver
in chopped chicken liver?

08:58.888 --> 09:00.890
Because that's what's
on a louie anderson.

09:00.890 --> 09:02.358
What?

09:02.358 --> 09:04.777
I've been getting it
at the show biz deli.

09:04.777 --> 09:05.561
[moans]

09:06.062 --> 09:07.113
bobby's gout
will clear up

09:07.613 --> 09:08.948
if he stays off
those deli foods.

09:09.398 --> 09:12.485
I-in the meantime,
I thought this might help.

09:12.485 --> 09:13.903
[gasps]

09:14.904 --> 09:16.906
does it come
with a hat?

09:18.541 --> 09:21.043
I just can't figure out
what picture of me

09:21.043 --> 09:23.412
somebody would wanna put
in a museum.

09:23.412 --> 09:25.915
The only photo circulating
in the public

09:26.165 --> 09:28.551
is my high-school
football picture.

09:28.551 --> 09:29.919
Well, it could
be anything.

09:30.419 --> 09:31.921
The internet is full
of pictures

09:31.921 --> 09:33.923
of each and every one
of you.

09:34.423 --> 09:37.426
'course you'd know tha
t if you ever visited
my web site.

09:37.426 --> 09:40.763
Well, I guess
i'll find out tonight
when we go to dallas.

09:41.180 --> 09:42.682
At least peggy's
excited about it.

09:42.682 --> 09:44.900
She's talking about
putting on earrings.

09:45.401 --> 09:48.521
Uh, what else
was she thinking about
putting on, hank?

09:48.521 --> 09:49.522
[stutters]

09:50.022 --> 09:51.240
pumps?

09:51.240 --> 09:52.825
[groans]

09:52.825 --> 09:55.027
now I know what
mona lisa's husband felt like

09:55.444 --> 09:57.446
when he headed off
to that museum.

09:57.446 --> 09:58.948
It's pride, hank.

09:58.948 --> 10:01.951
You know, I might
still be able to fit
into the old uniform.

10:01.951 --> 10:03.452
Think that would
be appropriate?

10:03.452 --> 10:05.454
Well, we'll ask.
Now, luanne,

10:05.454 --> 10:07.456
remember what I told you
about bobby's diet.

10:07.957 --> 10:09.959
Yeah, if I haven't
heard of the food

10:09.959 --> 10:12.461
that he wants to eat,
he cannot eat it.

Oh, I'm just shuffling off
to the living room.

10:18.634 --> 10:21.137

And away we go

10:37.820 --> 10:39.739

ought to fix that thing.

arlen, texas." huh!

11:15.191 --> 11:18.194
Look, hank,
dr. Morley took this x-ray.

11:18.194 --> 11:20.696
That's the name
of your doctor.

11:21.197 --> 11:22.698
Oh, dear lord!

11:22.698 --> 11:25.201
Hank, honey,
I think this is your colon

11:25.201 --> 11:26.702
from when
you were constipated.

11:26.702 --> 11:28.254
Oh, my god!

11:28.254 --> 11:30.539
Hank, please,
people are starting to look.

11:30.539 --> 11:33.042
Uh, excuse me,
this is my work.

11:33.042 --> 11:34.677
My art is not
to be touched.

11:35.177 --> 11:37.713

there's a highly overrated
collection in toronto.

That's my colon!

11:40.549 --> 11:42.101

11:42.101 --> 11:44.186

we should just go.

my property.

that you can put up
on display.

it's very rare.

I'm the only kid under 70
to get this

12:01.120 --> 12:04.490

in the lower balkans.

12:04.957 --> 12:07.460
I'll be happy to entertain
any questions.

Yes, you.

Uh, I'm sorry, um,

in front of you to joseph.

12:24.810 --> 12:27.146
Are you taking connie
to the dance?

By the way,
how's his toe gout

to be embarrassed about.

with a french accent.

Well, it's still not as bad
as seeing your husband's colon
on the wall.

I know, it's hanging
in our den.

of show biz,

14:43.866 --> 14:45.868

with him.

for him.
