00:09.999 --> 00:11.999
Keeping
Up with the Kardashians...

00:11.999 --> 00:14.999
It's just been a
really hard time, going from,

00:14.999 --> 00:18.999
like, having all of you guys to
having nobody, you know?

00:18.999 --> 00:21.999
It breaks my heart to
see her in pain.

00:21.999 --> 00:25.999
I just hope that
somehow God can, like, give me

00:25.999 --> 00:29.999
a chance... or us a chance at
this or something.

00:29.999 --> 00:31.999
Like, I don't know
if there's a day when, like,

00:31.999 --> 00:34.999
Scott can get it together and
be... change.

00:34.999 --> 00:36.999
Are you gonna wait,
like, that long?

00:36.999 --> 00:38.999
No, I'm not
waiting.

00:38.999 --> 00:43.999
I love Scott, but I've gotten to
a place where I'm just living

00:43.999 --> 00:52.999
life again.♪ ♪

00:52.999 --> 00:55.999
- Hey, Kim.
- Hey, Mom.

00:55.999 --> 00:59.999
- What are you doing?
- Just organizing North's

00:59.999 --> 01:01.999
- closet.
- Oh, this used to be

01:01.999 --> 01:04.999
- Kylie's closet.
- I know, now it's getting

01:04.999 --> 01:07.999
- some good use.
- So I just found this as

01:07.999 --> 01:11.999
I'm going through all of my
papers and Kylie's stuff.

01:11.999 --> 01:12.999
- Can I read it to you?
- Yeah.

01:12.999 --> 01:15.999
"I Am."
"I am from the horse playground

01:15.999 --> 01:19.999
of Hidden Hills to the enormous
community of Calabasas.

01:19.999 --> 01:22.999
I am from my muddy backyard of
fun to the trees we once climbed

01:22.999 --> 01:26.999
to the rainy outdoor playground
where we played Indians.

01:26.999 --> 01:28.999
I am from my loving parents."

01:32.999 --> 01:35.999
Oh, you're not gonna cry
when you're reading something

01:35.999 --> 01:38.999
she wrote.

01:38.999 --> 01:40.999
This is the stuff that
makes me so sentimental.

01:40.999 --> 01:43.999
I don't know what's wrong with
me-- I always get sad.

01:43.999 --> 01:45.999
So are you saying you're
mad I took her room?

01:45.999 --> 01:49.999
No, I'm glad you're
here, but it just makes me sad

01:49.999 --> 01:52.999
that she's not here.
How cute is this?

01:52.999 --> 01:54.999
- She painted that?
Uh-huh.

01:54.999 --> 01:56.999
That's her
self-portrait?

01:56.999 --> 02:13.999
She'd be mortified.♪ ♪

02:13.999 --> 02:15.999
Can you change my
hair color?

02:15.999 --> 02:17.999
Yeah, what color you
thinking?

02:17.999 --> 02:19.999
I can't go to black, but I can
do any color.

02:19.999 --> 02:20.999
Maybe you can do
blonde with this color.

02:20.999 --> 02:22.999
I think that'll be a
good contrast.

02:22.999 --> 02:24.999
So you have, like, all warm
tones.

02:24.999 --> 02:25.999
- Yeah.
- Okay.

02:25.999 --> 02:29.999
- Whatever you want.
- Okay.

02:29.999 --> 02:31.999
You look perfect.
Perfect, perfect.

02:31.999 --> 02:34.999
I'm doing a photo
shoot right now for my Lip Kit

02:34.999 --> 02:36.999
with Dolce.
I just feel like there's been a

02:36.999 --> 02:40.999
lot of attention around my lips,
and every single time I would

02:40.999 --> 02:44.999
announce what lip liner I was
using, it would immediately be

02:44.999 --> 02:48.999
sold out, so I just wanted to
create my own.

02:48.999 --> 02:51.999
I think we should try to do,
like, a side look for this one.

02:51.999 --> 02:53.999
Okay.
Oh, I love that.

02:53.999 --> 02:57.999
Love, love, love.
Come look at these.

02:57.999 --> 02:59.999
I think these profiles are
great.

02:59.999 --> 03:00.999
Just find one with the hair that
you love.

03:00.999 --> 03:03.999
- I think the eyes are perfect.
- I love that one.

03:03.999 --> 03:04.999
Beautiful.
That one's great as is.

03:04.999 --> 03:07.999
- I love that one.
- Triple mark.

03:07.999 --> 03:08.999
I feel like we got
good ones.

03:08.999 --> 03:10.999
Oh, these are great.
All right, so you want to just

03:10.999 --> 03:12.999
do next color then, or do you
want to keep shooting?

03:12.999 --> 03:14.999
- Next color.
- Yeah, cool.

03:14.999 --> 03:16.999
- Kylie?
- Hi.

03:16.999 --> 03:18.999
You're not ready
yet?

03:18.999 --> 03:20.999
Ready?
I just shot.

03:20.999 --> 03:22.999
- How's my baby?
- Good. I'm shooting for

03:22.999 --> 03:24.999
- my Lip Kit.
- Are you camera

03:24.999 --> 03:26.999
ready?
Is that the look right there?

03:26.999 --> 03:28.999
Mm-hmm.
- Oh, can I do that?

03:28.999 --> 03:30.999
- Okay...
- One...

03:30.999 --> 03:33.999
- Two...
- Three.

03:33.999 --> 03:37.999
That's your look?
That is your look?

03:37.999 --> 03:39.999
I don't know what my
look is.

03:39.999 --> 03:42.999
Oh, my God!
I feel like my dad and I get

03:42.999 --> 03:47.999
along more now that we just like
to do the same things.

03:47.999 --> 03:49.999
You have to get it perfect.
See how it's all blotchy?

03:49.999 --> 03:51.999
She is so funny.
I'll say random stuff like, "I'm

03:51.999 --> 03:54.999
about to get a spray tan."
And she'll be like, "How are

03:54.999 --> 03:57.999
spray tans, are they good?
I think I want to try one."

03:57.999 --> 03:59.999
Um, by the way,
Sunday we'll do something.

03:59.999 --> 04:01.999
We'll go to dinner, we'll do
whatever.

04:01.999 --> 04:03.999
- Okay, cool.
- I think Kendall's

04:03.999 --> 04:05.999
- back in town, too.
- We're doing a

04:05.999 --> 04:09.999
- Snapchat.
- Yeah.

04:09.999 --> 04:11.999
- Cute!
- Cute!

04:15.999 --> 04:19.999
Do you like Mom's
changes she makes to her house?

04:19.999 --> 04:23.999
I don't think they're
significant enough.

04:23.999 --> 04:25.999
The table's better, but the
chairs aren't that much better

04:25.999 --> 04:28.999
- than what she had last time.
- I would get rid of

04:28.999 --> 04:30.999
- all the columns if you could.
- Yeah, and the stained

04:30.999 --> 04:33.999
- glass.
- You make me sound like

04:33.999 --> 04:36.999
I'm living in an old-age home,
and I'm senile and you guys are

04:36.999 --> 04:39.999
trying to make life-or-death
decisions for me and I'm not in

04:39.999 --> 04:43.999
- the room.
- But even if she just got

04:43.999 --> 04:46.999
- simple panes.
- I'm right here.

04:46.999 --> 04:49.999
I can hear you.
Um, so, guys?

04:49.999 --> 04:51.999
- Hmm?
- I went to go visit this

04:51.999 --> 04:55.000
doctor who does this DNA
testing, and what happens is you

04:55.000 --> 04:59.999
give them a little bit of blood,
but by doing these certain

04:59.999 --> 05:02.999
tests, they can tell if you're
predisposed to cancer or that

05:02.999 --> 05:05.999
you should stay away from
certain things because you're

05:05.999 --> 05:08.999
gonna get really sick or you
have nerve disease or, you know,

05:08.999 --> 05:10.999
- anything.
- So what's the point

05:10.999 --> 05:13.999
- of telling us this?
- The clinic is in La

05:13.999 --> 05:17.999
Jolla, down by where MJ lives.
And I think I'd like to have the

05:17.999 --> 05:20.000
guy come up and take my blood
and do the test, and then I'll

05:20.000 --> 05:23.999
go down and visit MJ and go
swing by his place and have him

05:23.999 --> 05:30.999
give me my results.
My mom is a super strong lady.

05:30.999 --> 05:35.999
She's overcome breast cancer,
and I think when you have a

05:35.999 --> 05:38.999
history of cancer in your
family, you really want to make

05:38.999 --> 05:44.999
sure that you can do any
possible test that's necessary.

05:44.999 --> 05:48.999
You really should have
the BRCA test, because my mother

05:48.999 --> 05:50.999
had cervical cancer.
This family's been through it

05:50.999 --> 05:53.999
- three generations.
- It would be such a

05:53.999 --> 05:58.999
great feeling if all my kids
would be tested to see if they

05:58.999 --> 06:02.999
carry any of the genes for
cancer, because if we are, then

06:02.999 --> 06:06.999
at least we can do something
about it and we're prepared.

06:06.999 --> 06:11.999
I just want you to get on my
bandwagon and do it with me.

06:11.999 --> 06:14.999
- Okay, let's do it!
- Yeah, you're in?

06:14.999 --> 06:17.999
Mm-hmm.
- So they're gonna pop by

06:17.999 --> 06:20.999
the shoot tomorrow and just do a
quick blood draw.

06:20.999 --> 06:23.999
So we're all gonna have
Band-Aids during our shoot.

06:23.999 --> 06:28.999
It's not that big of a
deal-- it's a blood draw.

06:36.999 --> 06:39.999
I cannot wait to
get these things off, 'cause I'm

06:39.999 --> 06:43.999
- just, like, it's not cute.
- Who created this

06:43.999 --> 06:45.999
- concept for the shoot?
- I think Kim.

06:45.999 --> 06:48.999
But, like, does anyone
get asked what we want to do or

06:48.999 --> 06:50.999
- just Kim just tells us?
- I don't know, but

06:50.999 --> 06:54.000
- your makeup looks so gorgeous.
- Really? Stop.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.999
What do you want?♪ ♪

06:57.999 --> 06:59.999
That's hot.
See, that's dressed like

06:59.999 --> 07:02.999
something I want.
Let's keep it fun.

07:02.999 --> 07:05.999
Today is the day we're
doing a gothic photo shoot.

07:05.999 --> 07:07.999
Brilliant.
Okay.

07:07.999 --> 07:11.999
There you go.
Arms.

Right there.
Beautiful.

You know, I'm just... love this
look, it's one of my favorite

07:16.999 --> 07:19.999
looks of all time.
And your face... There you go.

07:19.999 --> 07:22.999
Beautiful.
Get that cleavage in.

07:22.999 --> 07:26.999
Had to get away
from the cleavage, I was like...

07:26.999 --> 07:28.999
- Good job, guys.
- Thank you.

07:28.999 --> 07:29.999
Hey, Kris, how are
you?

07:29.999 --> 07:32.999
- Hi. How are you?
- Good, thanks.

07:32.999 --> 07:33.999
- Nice to see you. Hi.
- Mitch Mulanix with

07:33.999 --> 07:34.999
Pathway Genomics.
Nice to meet you.

07:34.999 --> 07:36.999
Hi. Nice to see you.
Now, are you the people that

07:36.999 --> 07:38.999
- Paul was telling me about?
- Exactly.

07:38.999 --> 07:41.999
What we're gonna do is look in
your bloodstream for genetic

07:41.999 --> 07:44.999
mutations that are associated
with certain cancers.

07:44.999 --> 07:46.999
I understand you've got a family
history there.

07:46.999 --> 07:49.999
So this'll-this'll look for
markers that you have it,

07:49.999 --> 07:53.999
- possibly, now.
- Sometimes it's so hard

07:53.999 --> 07:56.999
to get my family all in the same
room at the same time.

07:56.999 --> 07:58.999
- We'll be quick.
- No, I can talk

07:58.999 --> 08:00.999
- while-while you do that.
- What are we doing?

08:00.999 --> 08:02.999
Yeah, so what we're
doing is a genetic test.

08:02.999 --> 08:06.000
So what better time to
have this doctor come and take

08:06.000 --> 08:10.999
everybody's blood than right
now?

08:10.999 --> 08:13.999
- Thank you.
- Hey, Khlo.

08:13.999 --> 08:15.999
- Hey, Mom.
- So I have a quick

08:15.999 --> 08:18.999
question for you.
There's a guy who has this new

08:18.999 --> 08:23.999
technology that if he has a
sample of your blood or your

08:23.999 --> 08:26.999
saliva, that he can tell all
sorts of things about you.

08:26.999 --> 08:28.999
It's, like, the same
thing that Angelina Jolie did,

08:28.999 --> 08:31.999
where she had an 80% chance of
getting breast cancer, so she

08:31.999 --> 08:33.999
- got her boobs removed.
- Do you want to do it?

08:33.999 --> 08:35.999
- It's really, really...
- I don't have time.

08:35.999 --> 08:37.999
Takes two seconds.
They just take a little thing

08:37.999 --> 08:39.999
- of your blood.
- I literally don't have

08:39.999 --> 08:42.999
- time.
- He can come in here

08:42.999 --> 08:44.999
right now and take your blood.
It's, like, the most amazing

08:44.999 --> 08:47.999
thing that's, like, a real
privilege to do.

08:47.999 --> 08:50.999
- I don't have time.
- Khloe has always been

08:50.999 --> 08:54.999
resistant to any kind of a test.
Would it make you feel better if

08:54.999 --> 08:59.999
- we did a DNA test?
- No.

08:59.999 --> 09:02.999
But, out of all of us,
Khloe's the one who needs to

09:02.999 --> 09:06.999
have her blood drawn, because
she had a brush with skin

09:06.999 --> 09:08.999
cancer.

09:11.999 --> 09:14.999
- Good.
- I got asked to pose

09:14.999 --> 09:18.999
- for this nude shoot.
- This looks so cool.

09:18.999 --> 09:19.999
It's like a
painting.

09:19.999 --> 09:21.999
- Boom!
- You don't care if you

09:21.999 --> 09:23.999
possibly could get breast
cancer?

09:23.999 --> 09:24.999
We're all going to
die.

09:24.999 --> 09:26.999
Do you want to die when
you're 30 or do you want to die

09:26.999 --> 09:28.999
- when you're 85?
- I don't care.

09:28.999 --> 09:30.999
I don't care.

09:34.999 --> 09:36.999
He can come in here
right now and take your blood.

09:36.999 --> 09:39.999
It's, like, the most amazing
thing that's, like, a real

09:39.999 --> 09:42.999
- privilege to do.
- I don't have time.

09:42.999 --> 09:44.999
Khloe, it takes two
seconds.

09:44.999 --> 09:47.999
You can do saliva or you can do
blood.

09:47.999 --> 09:48.999
So, saliva, he's just
gonna swab my mouth?

09:48.999 --> 09:50.999
- Yeah.
- I'm not gonna draw

09:50.999 --> 09:51.999
- blood.
- Okay.

09:51.999 --> 09:53.999
- Like, I have to leave.
- Okay, all right.

09:53.999 --> 09:55.999
Let me go get him.
Somebody...

09:55.999 --> 09:57.999
I don't have time for
this.

09:57.999 --> 09:59.999
- Hi, Khloe.
- Hi. How are you?

09:59.999 --> 10:00.999
- Good. How are you?
- Good.

10:00.999 --> 10:02.999
- Good.
- How long does this

10:02.999 --> 10:04.999
- take?
- We need some saliva,

10:04.999 --> 10:06.999
- so it takes a few minutes to do.
- 'Cause I can't be

10:06.999 --> 10:08.999
- late, so...
- Yeah?

10:08.999 --> 10:09.999
How do you feel about giving
blood?

10:09.999 --> 10:11.999
Not in the mood.

10:11.999 --> 10:13.999
Okay.
Well, I understand your

10:13.999 --> 10:15.999
- grandmother had breast and...
- Colon.

10:15.999 --> 10:17.999
- ...colon cancer.
- Yeah.

10:17.999 --> 10:19.999
I would recommend,
you know, getting that test,

10:19.999 --> 10:21.999
- because...
- Yeah, I've had

10:21.999 --> 10:22.999
- skin cancer, too, already.
- Have you really?

10:22.999 --> 10:23.999
Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

10:23.999 --> 10:25.999
It's kind of scary, but you'd
rather know, because if you

Yes, I do.
Why do you...

11:14.999 --> 11:17.999
unfortunately, that off-road
one, something happened to the

11:17.999 --> 11:20.999

recharge the battery, and it

11:20.999 --> 11:23.999

used to be and they're bonding

20:21.999 --> 20:23.999
MJ is really sensitive
about it 'cause she had the BRCA

20:23.999 --> 20:26.999
gene, and so she wants me to
make sure I don't have it.

20:26.999 --> 20:30.999
I just don't like being, like,
forced like that, especially by

20:30.999 --> 20:33.999
- Kris Jenner and Kim.
- It's, like, "I've been

20:33.999 --> 20:36.999
worried my whole life that,
like, my grandkids, like, would

20:36.999 --> 20:38.999
have cancer."
Well, you know I am...

20:38.999 --> 20:40.999
No, I mean, I feel like
it does mean, like, the world to

20:40.999 --> 20:43.999
her.
I mean, obviously, do whatever

20:43.999 --> 20:46.999
- you want to do.
- I don't even think I

20:46.999 --> 20:51.999
know anybody anymore that hasn't
been touched by cancer.

20:51.999 --> 20:55.999
The chances that one of us might
have something negative is

20:55.999 --> 20:57.999
- there.
- Unless I'm doing the

20:57.999 --> 20:59.999
stuff with Dad, like,
dirt-biking...

20:59.999 --> 21:01.999
- Yeah.
- ...and adventurous

21:01.999 --> 21:02.999
- things...
- You should just talk

21:02.999 --> 21:04.999
- to her.
- I don't want to hurt

21:04.999 --> 21:06.999
her feelings.

21:15.999 --> 21:17.999
- Hello.
- Hi. How are you?

21:17.999 --> 21:19.999
- Hi. How you doing?
- Nice to see you.

21:19.999 --> 21:20.999
- Good. Nice to see you.
- It won't, like, make a

21:20.999 --> 21:22.999
- mess or anything?
- No.

21:22.999 --> 21:24.999
- Okay.
- No, not at all.

21:24.999 --> 21:26.999
- Perfect.
- So, I'm gonna ask a

21:26.999 --> 21:28.999
- few basic questions...
- Okay.

21:28.999 --> 21:30.999
...about your medical
history, and then you'll be all

21:30.999 --> 21:32.999

21:35.999 --> 21:37.999

- Good, thanks.

21:37.999 --> 21:39.999
I don't want MJ to
have to worry about me.

21:39.999 --> 21:40.999
If one of us does have the BRCA
gene, MJ would feel so guilty,

21:40.999 --> 21:44.999
so I'm totally fine taking this
test for MJ.

21:44.999 --> 21:46.999
Close your fist
really tight.

21:46.999 --> 21:48.999

- There we go.

21:48.999 --> 21:50.999

One, two. That's it.

21:50.999 --> 21:52.999
Okay, good.
That was fine.

21:52.999 --> 21:54.999

this test done.

21:57.999 --> 22:00.999
Sometimes she doesn't want to
know things 'cause she takes

22:00.999 --> 22:03.999
things really hard, so I'm glad
she stepped out of her comfort

22:03.999 --> 22:06.999

it's really important.

22:06.999 --> 22:08.999
What results is Kim
gonna get now?

22:08.999 --> 22:10.999
You're gonna be tested
for hereditary cancer

22:10.999 --> 22:11.999
- predisposition...
- Okay.

22:11.999 --> 22:15.999
- ...and BRCA1/2.
- What's that mean?

22:15.999 --> 22:18.999
BRCA1/2 are genes
associated with male and female

22:18.999 --> 22:21.999
breast cancer and ovarian
cancer.

22:21.999 --> 22:23.999
Mm-hmm.
- Other types of cancer

22:23.999 --> 22:27.999
like kidney, colon, melanoma,
lung and brain tumor.

22:27.999 --> 22:29.999
- Mmm. Cool.
- Yeah. But the main

22:29.999 --> 22:31.999
focus is on breast and
ovarian cancer.

22:31.999 --> 22:32.999
Is that the current
situation, or is that inherited?

22:32.999 --> 22:34.999
- No, it's your genes.
- Okay.

22:34.999 --> 22:36.999
So your genes will
remain the same.

22:36.999 --> 22:38.999
The moment you're conceived,
your genes are formed, and they

22:38.999 --> 22:40.999
- will stay the same.
- Either way, we're...

22:40.999 --> 22:41.999
- Yeah.
- ... dying of

22:41.999 --> 22:43.999

40:57.999 --> 40:59.999

40:59.999 --> 41:01.999

41:01.999 --> 41:03.999
You did a good job, Khloe.
That was great.

41:03.999 --> 41:07.999
Chris said he's in the room, so
he's gonna text me in a few

41:07.999 --> 41:14.999
- minutes and give me an update.
- Mom, that made me sad.

41:14.999 --> 41:21.999
That just, like,
really breaks my heart.

41:27.999 --> 41:31.999
She needs somebody
that's stable and consistent in

41:31.999 --> 41:33.999
her life, and he says he wants
to change.

41:33.999 --> 41:35.999
Yeah, exactly.
I already told him that.

41:35.999 --> 41:37.999
- It looked like he was out of it.
- Do you...

41:37.999 --> 41:39.999
It didn't look like he
was sick.

41:39.999 --> 41:41.999
He just looked like he was
super depressed and out of it.

41:41.999 --> 41:44.999
He's got to calm down.
If he... he either wants to be a

41:44.999 --> 41:48.999
dad and be in Kourtney's life or
he doesn't, you know?

41:48.999 --> 41:51.000
Yeah, it's true.
I just think then you'll really

41:51.000 --> 41:53.999
have no life, except for these,
like, people that you hang out

41:53.999 --> 41:56.999

41:56.999 --> 41:59.999
It's so stressful when something
like this happens in your

41:59.999 --> 42:04.999
family, because he's like my
son, so I just thank God for

42:04.999 --> 42:08.999
Chris Reda today, to give us
some peace, just knowing that

42:08.999 --> 42:12.999
we know where Scott is and that
Chris is there.

42:12.999 --> 42:14.999
The thing, though,
I've never seen him do-- I mean,

42:14.999 --> 42:17.999
I've heard him on the phone with
me a few times cry-- but he

42:17.999 --> 42:21.999
was, like, bawling, crying, when
he was on the phone with Khloe.

42:21.999 --> 42:23.999
I've never seen that, like, side
of him.

42:23.999 --> 42:28.999
Yeah.
I think he's, you know, this

42:28.999 --> 42:32.999
hopefully is his rock bottom and
he... all he has to do is come

42:32.999 --> 42:35.999
home and be consistent.
I mean, we all told him, "We

42:35.999 --> 42:39.999
love you so much, but we've seen
it time and time again."

42:39.999 --> 42:41.999
No, for sure, he needs
to go home.

42:41.999 --> 42:44.999
All right, so I'm gonna... I'll
give you a call later when I go

42:44.999 --> 42:46.999
check on him or I'll call you
tomorrow when I find out, you

42:46.999 --> 42:50.000
- know, what we're gonna do.
- I thought Scott hit

42:50.000 --> 42:52.999
rock bottom. He hadn't.
It's frustrating on so many

42:52.999 --> 42:59.999
levels, but my hope is this is
the final straw for him inside

42:59.999 --> 43:02.999
his own soul.
Okay, thank you, Chris.

43:02.999 --> 43:05.999
I'm so sorry to interrupt your
time, I really am.

43:05.999 --> 43:07.999
No, don't worry about
it, I'll do anything for Scott.

43:07.999 --> 43:09.999
Well, we love you for
that, thank you.

43:09.999 --> 43:17.999
- Bye.
- Bye.

43:17.999 --> 43:20.999
- On the next episode...
- I've never seen him cry

43:20.999 --> 43:23.999
- that hard.
- But I... then I got a

43:23.999 --> 43:25.999
text last night and they were
like, "Oh, my God, Scott

43:25.999 --> 43:27.999
Disick's in there."
They said he was so wasted.

43:27.999 --> 43:33.999
Last night?
This is just a fun activity.

43:33.999 --> 43:36.999
I'm spreading myself

43:36.999 --> 43:39.999
too thin with 12-hour days.
Like, what's more important-- is

43:39.999 --> 43:41.999
- your daughter's sanity?
- Just breathe.

43:41.999 --> 43:43.999
- I'll take care of it.
- No, you just breathe.
