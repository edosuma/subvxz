WEBVTT

00:07.308 --> 00:08.609
Okay, he isn't answering
my texts.

00:08.609 --> 00:11.445
He probably just needs time
to process.

00:11.445 --> 00:13.247
I always meant to tell him
over dinner,

00:13.247 --> 00:14.715
at, like, a really nice
restaurant,

00:14.715 --> 00:16.484
but after a couple
glasses of wine,

00:16.484 --> 00:20.154
not tripping my face off
at Lauren's hot mitzvah.

00:20.154 --> 00:22.090
I love this music.

00:22.090 --> 00:23.424
What music?

00:23.424 --> 00:25.559
There is no music.

00:25.559 --> 00:26.760
Are you still rolling?

00:26.760 --> 00:28.296
A little bit.
Aren't you?

00:28.296 --> 00:29.997
No, nothing gets you
sober quicker

00:29.997 --> 00:31.499
then telling your boyfriend

00:31.499 --> 00:33.301
you've been lying about
your age by 15 years.

00:33.301 --> 00:34.802
I love this street!

00:34.802 --> 00:36.270
You are useless to me
right now.

00:36.270 --> 00:37.638
Taxi!

00:37.638 --> 00:39.207
- Where we going?
- You're going home.

00:39.207 --> 00:40.408
Oh.

00:40.408 --> 00:41.609
I'm gonna go find Josh.

00:41.609 --> 00:43.844
- Okay.
- Get home safe.

00:43.844 --> 00:45.313
(Maggie)
Ciao.

00:50.651 --> 00:54.488
(Liza)
Can I sit down?

00:54.488 --> 00:57.658
You do whatever you want,
obviously.

01:06.033 --> 01:08.836
Josh, when we first met
at the bar that night,

01:08.836 --> 01:11.972
you kind of assumed that we were
about the same age.

01:11.972 --> 01:13.274
Yeah.

01:13.274 --> 01:14.708
It was fun,
and I was flattered,

01:14.708 --> 01:16.477
and so I went with it.

01:16.477 --> 01:19.547
I didn't know we were ever gonna
see each other again.

01:19.547 --> 01:22.216
And then when we did,

01:22.216 --> 01:23.984
I became so attracted to you.

01:23.984 --> 01:27.855
You made me feel like
everything was possible again.

01:27.855 --> 01:29.823
And then the stronger
my feelings became for you,

01:29.823 --> 01:33.561
the harder it became for me
to tell you the truth.

01:33.561 --> 01:35.329
So what exactly
is the truth?

01:35.329 --> 01:37.931
It's--it's that you're
a 40-year-old woman

01:37.931 --> 01:42.303
who is pretending to the world
that she's 26?

01:42.303 --> 01:44.505
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

01:44.505 --> 01:45.973
That's some crazy shit.

01:47.375 --> 01:49.977
Why would you do that?

01:49.977 --> 01:53.547
At first, I was just lying
about my age to get a job.

01:53.547 --> 01:55.216
See, after my divorce...

01:55.216 --> 01:56.550
Divorce?

01:58.186 --> 02:01.054
Yeah, we'll get to that.

02:01.054 --> 02:04.458
I had been out of work for
almost 15 years,

02:04.458 --> 02:05.959
raising my daughter.

02:07.361 --> 02:08.562
Oh, my God.

02:08.562 --> 02:10.464
And you have a daughter.

02:10.464 --> 02:13.100
Caitlin.

02:13.100 --> 02:14.335
Where is she?

02:14.335 --> 02:17.305
Away at school,
in college, in India.

02:17.305 --> 02:19.773
I mean, you're kind of
a lunatic, aren't you?

02:19.773 --> 02:21.875
I was trying to get back
into publishing,

02:21.875 --> 02:23.877
but no one would hire
a 40-year-old

02:23.877 --> 02:25.513
who had been out of work
all that time.

02:25.513 --> 02:26.714
I couldn't accept
that I would

02:26.714 --> 02:28.081
never be able
to work again

02:28.081 --> 02:29.650
doing something
that I loved.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.619
So I lied about my age.

02:31.619 --> 02:32.853
I mean, I guess it didn't hurt

02:32.853 --> 02:34.522
that you had
a younger boyfriend

02:34.522 --> 02:36.857
to make everything
seem real, right?

02:36.857 --> 02:39.993
No, my feelings for you have
always been completely real.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.129
In fact, I've never felt more
like the real me

02:42.129 --> 02:44.698
than I have spending these
last few months with you.

02:44.698 --> 02:46.900
Nothing was real

02:46.900 --> 02:49.770
if it was all based
in a lie.

02:51.038 --> 02:52.240
None of it.

02:54.775 --> 02:56.410
Josh, I'm still me.

02:56.410 --> 03:01.249
I'm just a little bit older
than you thought.

03:01.249 --> 03:03.517
It's not the age.
It's not.

03:03.517 --> 03:04.918
It's the lie.

03:04.918 --> 03:06.754
I mean, I can't--
I can't get past the fact

03:06.754 --> 03:09.657
that you've been lying to me
this entire time.

03:12.626 --> 03:15.263
Okay.

03:15.263 --> 03:16.730
You're right.

03:16.730 --> 03:18.366
All right, look,
it'll break my heart,

03:18.366 --> 03:19.733
but I totally understand

03:19.733 --> 03:21.101
if you never want to
see me again.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.872
That's good.

03:24.872 --> 03:28.041
Because I don't ever want to
see you again.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.911
Have a nice,
fraudulent life.

03:49.663 --> 03:50.898
Liza!

03:50.898 --> 03:52.400
I've been texting you
all weekend.

03:52.400 --> 03:53.634
What happened?

03:53.634 --> 03:55.068
You and Josh just
left the party.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.970
Well, after Lauren spiked
the Manischewitz with Molly,

03:56.970 --> 03:58.506
things got a little crazy.

03:58.506 --> 04:00.608
Like, "get a room" crazy?

04:00.608 --> 04:01.842
Yeah, yeah.

04:01.842 --> 04:03.311
I'll spare you
the details.

04:03.311 --> 04:05.178
- Come on, we're gonna be late.'
- Good morning.

04:05.178 --> 04:08.048
I hope everyone had
a relaxing weekend,

04:08.048 --> 04:09.717
because we have a very big
mountain to climb.

04:09.717 --> 04:12.920
What I'm about to tell you
cannot leave this room.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.088
Ellen DeGeneres has written
another memoir.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.325
Oh, my God,
it's gonna be huge.

04:17.325 --> 04:20.793
The gays and the housewives
are going to love this.

04:20.793 --> 04:22.029
Bring in the Jews,

04:22.029 --> 04:23.597
and we'll have
a three quadrant book.

04:23.597 --> 04:24.932
There is going to be
an auction

04:24.932 --> 04:27.200
among all of
the major publishing houses.

04:27.200 --> 04:29.370
Ellen has spoken to her agent,

04:29.370 --> 04:32.840
and he's going to let Empirical
make the first bid.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.041
That is wonderful.

04:34.041 --> 04:35.476
I want all departments
on this.

04:35.476 --> 04:36.677
Of course.

04:36.677 --> 04:40.247
I do not want to
lose this book.

04:40.247 --> 04:42.350
And you won't.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.563
Stop texting.

04:55.563 --> 04:56.797
I'm late for lunch.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.666
Make sure you confirm
my 1:00 reservation

04:58.666 --> 05:00.468
at the The Monkey Bar,
table 5.

05:00.468 --> 05:03.771
Already done.

05:03.771 --> 05:05.172
Have you been crying?

05:05.172 --> 05:06.374
No.

05:06.374 --> 05:08.108
There's no crying
in publishing.

05:08.108 --> 05:11.645
Definitely not crying.

05:11.645 --> 05:13.246
Pull up the marketing budget
for the last Tina Fey book.

05:13.246 --> 05:14.815
We'll have to double
those numbers

05:14.815 --> 05:16.016
to get Ellen's attention.

05:16.016 --> 05:17.217
Well, Tina may be
a bossypants,

05:17.217 --> 05:18.619
but Ellen's a smartypants.

05:18.619 --> 05:20.053
Just get the Uber.

05:24.525 --> 05:25.726
Hey.

05:25.726 --> 05:27.160
Hey.

05:27.160 --> 05:30.063
So Josh and I didn't leave
the party to have sex.

05:30.063 --> 05:31.264
We broke up last night.

05:31.264 --> 05:32.733
Oh, my God,
what happened?

05:32.733 --> 05:34.402
You know,
just the usual stuff.

05:34.402 --> 05:36.604
When it came down to it,
we just weren't a good match.

05:36.604 --> 05:38.071
I'm confused.

05:38.071 --> 05:39.773
How do you just break up?

05:39.773 --> 05:41.208
We just did.

05:41.208 --> 05:42.610
It's just over,

05:42.610 --> 05:44.044
and I wanted to tell you

05:44.044 --> 05:46.980
so that we don't have to
talk about it anymore, okay?

05:46.980 --> 05:49.983
I'm so sorry.

05:49.983 --> 05:51.619
Me too.

05:51.619 --> 05:53.854
Are you sure you don't want to
tell me what happened?

05:53.854 --> 05:55.055
I can't.

05:55.055 --> 05:56.957
It hurts too much.

05:56.957 --> 05:59.793
But I still love him.

05:59.793 --> 06:01.862
I think I always will.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.063
Of course.

06:03.063 --> 06:05.065
Come here.

06:10.003 --> 06:11.204

06:11.204 --> 06:12.806
- Hello?
- Liza.

06:12.806 --> 06:14.007
I'm at Monkey Bar,

06:14.007 --> 06:15.443
and I left my wallet
on my desk.

06:15.443 --> 06:16.710
Okay.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.111
(Diana)
Well, I need you
to bring it to me.

06:18.111 --> 06:19.647
I'm in Midtown with no money.

06:19.647 --> 06:20.948
Okay, okay.

06:20.948 --> 06:23.984
I'll be right there.
I'm on my way.

06:23.984 --> 06:25.486
I got to go.

06:33.794 --> 06:35.529
Thank God.

06:38.466 --> 06:40.300
Go buy yourself a shawarma.

06:40.300 --> 06:41.835
Do I know you
from somewhere?

06:41.835 --> 06:43.370
No, I don't think so.

06:43.370 --> 06:45.205
You look very familiar.

06:45.205 --> 06:46.840
Well, unless you're slumming it
in Bed-Stuy,

06:46.840 --> 06:49.610
I seriously doubt
you know my assistant.

06:49.610 --> 06:50.944
Wait.

06:50.944 --> 06:52.379
Were you ever a waitress
at Serafina?

06:52.379 --> 06:53.647
The one on Madison.

06:53.647 --> 06:56.049
Oh, no, but I do have
waitress face,

06:56.049 --> 06:57.250
so I get that a lot.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.652
It was nice meeting you.

06:58.652 --> 06:59.853
Oh, my God.

06:59.853 --> 07:02.189
I am so sorry.

07:02.189 --> 07:03.557
Just go!

07:06.727 --> 07:08.596
I am so sorry.

07:08.596 --> 07:10.230
So am I.

07:11.398 --> 07:12.833

I just had the closest call.

07:12.833 --> 07:14.234
(Maggie)
What happened?

07:14.234 --> 07:16.136
I ran into this woman
I worked with 14 years ago

07:16.136 --> 07:17.137
when I was at Random House.

07:17.137 --> 07:18.171
She was having lunch with Diana,

07:18.171 --> 07:19.372
and she almost recognized me.

07:19.372 --> 07:21.509
Oh, how'd she look?

07:21.509 --> 07:24.411
- I got to go.
- Okay, ciao.

07:24.411 --> 07:26.680
Oh, we have to have
a chat.

07:26.680 --> 07:27.815
Now.

07:33.621 --> 07:37.525
So we've got a little problem
on our hands.

07:37.525 --> 07:38.659
We do?

07:41.662 --> 07:43.063
Cheryl Sussman doesn't think

07:43.063 --> 07:45.633
her $2,000 sweater
is dry cleanable.

07:47.200 --> 07:48.936
Oh.

07:48.936 --> 07:50.771
Oh, I'm so sorry.

07:50.771 --> 07:51.772
I'll pay for it.

07:51.772 --> 07:52.973
Of course.

07:52.973 --> 07:54.542
Don't be ridiculous.

07:54.542 --> 07:55.543
We'll expense it.

07:55.543 --> 07:56.744
Besides,
Cheryl deserves it.

07:56.744 --> 07:58.411
The only reason
she wanted to have lunch

07:58.411 --> 08:01.081
was to pump me for information
on our Ellen book deal.

08:01.081 --> 08:04.685
Now, did you put together
the Tina Fey marketing numbers?

08:04.685 --> 08:05.819
Yes. Yes.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.420
I have them;
they're on my desk.

08:19.032 --> 08:20.601
I knew it was you.

08:20.601 --> 08:22.369
What the hell is going on?

08:26.373 --> 08:28.208
Well, after I found out my
husband was having an affair

08:28.208 --> 08:29.643
and gambled away everything

08:29.643 --> 08:31.344
we spent our entire marriage
building together,

08:31.344 --> 08:33.013
I figured, "Hey, what do I
have to lose?

08:33.013 --> 08:34.214
Nothing."

08:34.214 --> 08:37.317
So I lied about my age.

08:37.317 --> 08:38.986
It's not a crime, Cheryl.

08:38.986 --> 08:42.590
Well, it's maybe a small
white-collar offense.

08:42.590 --> 08:44.057
But the real crime
is that no one will give

08:44.057 --> 08:47.160
a 40-year-old woman a chance
to start over again.

08:47.160 --> 08:48.495
Exactly.

08:48.495 --> 08:50.397
Isn't life just one big
confidence game?

08:50.397 --> 08:51.965
I mean, sometimes I think,

08:51.965 --> 08:55.468
I control huge budgets for
this massive media company,

08:55.468 --> 08:57.170
and half the time,

08:57.170 --> 08:59.607
I don't have the vaguest idea
what I'm doing.

08:59.607 --> 09:01.241
On the outside,
I pretend that I do,

09:01.241 --> 09:06.246
but on the inside,
I just feel like such a fraud.

09:06.246 --> 09:08.616
I know exactly
what you mean.

09:08.616 --> 09:11.351
Well, you actually
are a fraud.

09:11.351 --> 09:12.653
True.

09:12.653 --> 09:14.154
It's pretty stressful.

09:14.154 --> 09:16.790
I cannot imagine
how Diana would react

09:16.790 --> 09:17.991
if she found out
the truth.

09:17.991 --> 09:19.793
Oh, my God, Cheryl,
she can't know.

09:19.793 --> 09:21.161
I would lose my job.

09:21.161 --> 09:23.797
And Diana would be
humiliated.

09:23.797 --> 09:26.333
Gawker would have
a field day with this,

09:26.333 --> 09:27.668
but I would never.

09:27.668 --> 09:30.403
- Good.
- Please, Liza.

09:30.403 --> 09:31.739
I'm your friend.

09:31.739 --> 09:36.009
I just wonder if I could ask you
one small favor.

09:36.009 --> 09:38.011
Of course, Cheryl,
anything.

09:38.011 --> 09:40.313
Could you get me
Empirical's marketing numbers

09:40.313 --> 09:42.415
on the Ellen book?

09:42.415 --> 09:43.751
Excuse me?

09:43.751 --> 09:44.952
I'm sure you're not aware,

09:44.952 --> 09:47.054
but there is
a big auction happening

09:47.054 --> 09:48.455
over Ellen's new book,

09:48.455 --> 09:50.724
and I would be tickled pink

09:50.724 --> 09:55.062
if you could show me
what you guys are proposing.

09:55.062 --> 09:56.930
Cheryl, isn't it
proprietary information?

09:56.930 --> 09:59.066
Well, I don't think
I need to teach you

09:59.066 --> 10:01.068
how to color
outside the lines.

10:01.068 --> 10:03.503
[laughs]

10:03.503 --> 10:05.873
You're putting me in a very
compromising position here.

10:05.873 --> 10:08.375
Well, you're putting me in
a very compromising position

10:08.375 --> 10:10.978
to have to lie for you
to Diana Trout.

10:17.350 --> 10:18.652
I'll see what I can do.

10:18.652 --> 10:21.021
Thank you, honey.

10:21.021 --> 10:24.291
It is so great to see you again
after all these years.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.559
Oh.

10:26.559 --> 10:28.996
And by the way,
I have two children,

10:28.996 --> 10:30.764
and I've never
stopped working.

10:33.667 --> 10:35.302
That's what nannies
are for.

10:41.108 --> 10:42.109
Hey.

10:42.109 --> 10:43.510
I'm sorry I'm late.

10:43.510 --> 10:45.078
Oh, no problem.

10:45.078 --> 10:46.246
Everything okay?

10:46.246 --> 10:47.748
I just had a drink
with Cheryl Sussman.

10:47.748 --> 10:49.049
She remembers me all right.

10:49.049 --> 10:51.251
Okay, something like that
was bound to happen.

10:51.251 --> 10:53.086
Yeah, but now she's
blackmailing me.

10:53.086 --> 10:55.155
She wants me to share
some confidential information

10:55.155 --> 10:56.556
about a book
we're bidding on.

10:56.556 --> 10:58.058
You know, you should let me
talk to her.

10:58.058 --> 10:59.392
- I'll straighten her out.
- Forget it, Maggie.

10:59.392 --> 11:01.261
I think this is my endgame
right here.

11:01.261 --> 11:03.063
You know, I've always thought of
myself as the nicest person,

11:03.063 --> 11:04.832
but as it turns out,
I'm kind of a sociopath.

11:04.832 --> 11:06.033
Don't beat yourself up.

11:06.033 --> 11:07.467
I mean, you know what?

11:07.467 --> 11:08.902
Let's beat up Cheryl instead.

11:08.902 --> 11:10.738
I think I'm just gonna
move back to New Jersey.

11:10.738 --> 11:12.039
Maybe I could get a job

11:12.039 --> 11:13.373
attacking people with
perfume samples

11:13.373 --> 11:14.742
at the Paramus Mall.

11:14.742 --> 11:16.609
Listen, Liza, you're living
in a shadow world,

11:16.609 --> 11:17.911
and sometimes,
every now and then,

11:17.911 --> 11:18.946
you have to play by
shadow rules.

11:18.946 --> 11:20.113
What are you talking about?

11:20.113 --> 11:22.015
It's marketing numbers
on a book.

11:22.015 --> 11:24.017
I mean, look,
what's the big deal?

11:24.017 --> 11:26.053
Don't let this woman blow it
for you.

11:27.620 --> 11:30.557
[quirky music]

11:30.557 --> 11:32.092
This is a terrible idea.

11:36.229 --> 11:37.865
Ow!

11:37.865 --> 11:38.999
They've already split up.

11:38.999 --> 11:41.101
How much worse can it get?

11:41.101 --> 11:42.770
Did she really say
she still loves him?

11:42.770 --> 11:44.137
- Yes.
- Okay.

11:44.137 --> 11:45.338
Josh.
Josh, hey.

11:45.338 --> 11:46.439
Over here.

11:46.439 --> 11:47.775
What are you guys
doing here?

11:47.775 --> 11:48.976
We came to see your band.

11:48.976 --> 11:50.377
You guys are so good.

11:50.377 --> 11:51.779
Seriously?

11:51.779 --> 11:53.046
No, seriously, we came to
ask you a question.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.314
How could you dump Liza
like that?

11:54.314 --> 11:55.883
How is this
any of your business?

11:55.883 --> 11:57.450
Okay, something happened
between you guys

11:57.450 --> 11:58.685
at my hot mitzvah,

11:58.685 --> 11:59.787
which was meant
as a celebration of love,

11:59.787 --> 12:01.088
okay, not destruction.

12:01.088 --> 12:02.289
And I have come in the spirit

12:02.289 --> 12:03.323
of tikkun olam,

12:03.323 --> 12:04.591
which in
the Jewish faith means

12:04.591 --> 12:05.793
"repair the world,
and I--"

12:05.793 --> 12:07.194
Stop.

12:07.194 --> 12:08.561
Josh.

12:08.561 --> 12:10.163
It's none of our business.
We know that.

12:10.163 --> 12:12.165
And Liza would kill us
if she knew that we were here.

12:12.165 --> 12:13.867
Okay, but I think
that you should know

12:13.867 --> 12:15.335
that she still loves you.

12:15.335 --> 12:17.805
Look, I appreciate
what you're doing,

12:17.805 --> 12:19.873
but things happened
between us

12:19.873 --> 12:21.074
that you don't
know about

12:21.074 --> 12:23.310
and don't understand, so...

12:23.310 --> 12:25.578
Oh, okay, okay.
Now I'm interested.

12:27.347 --> 12:29.549
Bottom line is,
I never really knew her.

12:29.549 --> 12:30.818
What?

12:30.818 --> 12:31.952
It's good seeing you,
Kels.

12:31.952 --> 12:33.353
Thank you for trying.

12:33.353 --> 12:34.822
And you.

12:34.822 --> 12:37.925
Next time you think about
drugging your friends,

12:37.925 --> 12:39.059
don't do it.

12:39.059 --> 12:40.828
All right?

12:40.828 --> 12:42.395
So not cool.

12:42.395 --> 12:45.432
Okay, well, shalom to you,
too, brother.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.167
Can we go home?
I'm sorry.

12:55.542 --> 12:57.044
Hey.

12:57.044 --> 12:59.646
I'm wondering if Editorial
has any profit and loss numbers

12:59.646 --> 13:02.382
they could share
for the Ellen book.

13:02.382 --> 13:04.217
Why would you
need to see those?

13:04.217 --> 13:05.418
Diana.

13:05.418 --> 13:06.753
She just wants to
see everything

13:06.753 --> 13:08.488
before she submits
her marketing budget.

13:08.488 --> 13:10.590
Okay, well, I'll send you
what I have.

13:10.590 --> 13:12.325
Thanks.

13:12.325 --> 13:15.128
Hey, can we talk
just for a minute?

13:16.864 --> 13:18.065
Sure.

13:18.065 --> 13:21.668
What's up?

13:21.668 --> 13:24.737
Lauren and I went to go see
Josh's band play last night.

13:24.737 --> 13:27.040
What?
Why?

13:27.040 --> 13:28.775
I don't want to interfere.

13:28.775 --> 13:31.011
I just--I hated seeing you
so unhappy,

13:31.011 --> 13:33.680
and I just wanted to
talk to him.

13:33.680 --> 13:36.749
And what did he say?

13:36.749 --> 13:41.288
Just that you never really
let him get to know you.

13:41.288 --> 13:43.390
That's true.

13:43.390 --> 13:45.893
Maybe I didn't.

13:45.893 --> 13:49.296
Look, I know we all want to be
the perfect girl

13:49.296 --> 13:52.065
in a relationship.

13:52.065 --> 13:56.303
So maybe you just need to
let Josh see the real you,

13:56.303 --> 13:57.504
not just the good stuff.

13:57.504 --> 13:58.705
You know,
even the parts of you

13:58.705 --> 14:00.473
that you're
not so proud of.

14:00.473 --> 14:02.342
That isn't always
that easy for me.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.011
Don't hold back.

14:04.011 --> 14:05.312
Get messy.

14:05.312 --> 14:06.914
Show him the full Liza.

14:06.914 --> 14:09.782
I don't think
that it's too late.

14:09.782 --> 14:11.718
You're a real friend,
Kelsey.

14:12.986 --> 14:15.788
The best I've made
in a long time.

14:15.788 --> 14:17.991
I feel the same way
about you.

14:17.991 --> 14:19.492
Thank you.

14:22.762 --> 14:24.731
I'll get those numbers
for you.

15:43.910 --> 15:46.446
(Liza)
Wow. Champagne.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.648
Here's to a wonderful
partnership.

15:50.517 --> 15:53.020
I don't want you to feel bad
about this, Liza.

15:53.020 --> 15:54.521
You're doing
the right thing.

15:54.521 --> 15:55.855
How can I not feel bad

15:55.855 --> 15:57.390
about sharing
company secrets?

15:57.390 --> 16:00.727
We both know you'll do whatever
it takes to get an edge.

16:00.727 --> 16:03.896
Besides, if Diana knew
the truth,

16:03.896 --> 16:05.932
she'd have you blackballed
from publishing.

16:05.932 --> 16:07.600
[laughs]

16:07.600 --> 16:08.935
There might even be
a lawsuit.

16:10.603 --> 16:12.572
You're right.

16:12.572 --> 16:14.474
Well...

16:14.474 --> 16:15.808
Here you are.

16:18.345 --> 16:19.712
What's this?

16:19.712 --> 16:21.381
Oh, sweetie, it's our
email exchange.

16:21.381 --> 16:23.683
It's you asking
for all of Empirical's

16:23.683 --> 16:25.252
profit and loss
and marketing numbers.

16:25.252 --> 16:28.455
This goes straight to Gawker
unless you back off.

16:28.455 --> 16:29.656
You'd be ruined too.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.691
I'd lose
a shitty assistant job.

16:31.691 --> 16:33.660
You're the one
who loses everything.

16:35.262 --> 16:36.529
I wonder how long you think

16:36.529 --> 16:37.964
you can really
get away with this.

16:37.964 --> 16:39.899
I guess we'll find out.

17:02.555 --> 17:04.523
No, he's not here.

17:04.523 --> 17:05.992
Will you give him this?

ma'am.

imagine you in Brooklyn.

to prom, huh?

I'm gonna hand you over
to Maggie.

I'll see you tomorrow.

- I can't wait.
- Me too.

I wanted to tell you
so many times.

You have no idea.

19:17.123 --> 19:18.758
So why didn't you?

19:18.758 --> 19:20.627
I was afraid.

19:20.627 --> 19:23.530
Afraid you would suddenly think
I was someone I wasn't.

19:23.530 --> 19:26.098
But I'm exactly
who you think I am.

19:27.400 --> 19:28.901

19:28.901 --> 19:30.637
I just don't know.

19:33.573 --> 19:35.242
to pick up right
where we left off.

All I'm asking for
is a new beginning.

exactly?
