00:24.578 --> 00:28.578
Subrip by DanDee

02:26.579 --> 02:28.547
Driver's license?

02:38.691 --> 02:42.494
You know you was
ten Ks over back there?

02:46.499 --> 02:48.567
Where you headed?

02:50.570 --> 02:52.204
Been drinking today?

02:54.240 --> 02:55.507
No worries.

02:55.509 --> 02:58.544
Just need you to blow into this.

03:02.483 --> 03:05.684
Keep going. Yep.

03:11.724 --> 03:13.725
Step out of the car, please.

03:16.496 --> 03:18.864
I said step out of the car.

05:19.952 --> 05:22.187
Hey!

05:22.189 --> 05:25.023
Hey, fellas,
you wanna settle down there?

05:25.025 --> 05:28.293
Oi! You mob!

06:10.670 --> 06:13.205
Morning, Mayor.
Sally.

06:13.207 --> 06:15.340
Usual?
Thanks.

06:17.377 --> 06:20.512
Morning, Josh.
Maureen.

06:20.514 --> 06:23.618
Heard there was a bit
of silly buggers down

06:23.619 --> 06:26.619
here last night.
Nothing too serious, I hope.

06:26.620 --> 06:28.019
Just the usual.

06:29.222 --> 06:31.590
How're you going?
Oh, I'm keeping busy.

06:31.592 --> 06:36.495
There's... just shit going on with
the blackfellas out at Broken River.

06:36.497 --> 06:39.431
You know, they're drinking,
fighting, whatnot. So...

06:39.433 --> 06:41.466
I've got enough to keep me
in and out of trouble.

06:41.468 --> 06:43.568
I bet you do.

06:43.570 --> 06:49.541
Josh, there's something I've
been meaning to let you in on.

06:49.543 --> 06:53.612
Furnace Creek's applied
for a new expansion license.

06:53.614 --> 06:55.847
For where?
Everywhere, just about.

06:55.849 --> 06:58.016
Well, the whole
Goldstone catchment, anyway.

06:58.018 --> 07:00.318
Fuck, that's bloody big.
Top you up, Josh?

07:00.320 --> 07:02.821
Yeah. Thanks, Sally.

07:04.223 --> 07:06.958
Yeah, it's a very big deal
for all of us,

07:06.960 --> 07:09.728
and I mean all of us.
But it's complicated.

07:09.730 --> 07:13.965
Needs blackfella approval, and
there's a mile of bright red tape.

07:13.967 --> 07:16.134
What do you want from me?

07:16.136 --> 07:19.704
Well, I know you don't like
to get too involved in things,

07:19.706 --> 07:21.506
but just keep your eyes
and ears open,

07:21.508 --> 07:27.212
and if you feel any heat, especially
from Broken River, let me know.

07:27.214 --> 07:30.549
We got Tommy from the
Land Council on our side,

07:30.551 --> 07:34.853
but we don't want anyone
further complicating things.

07:34.855 --> 07:38.957
Yeah, no worries.
Good.

07:38.959 --> 07:41.526
Also, you might want to know.

07:41.528 --> 07:45.197
A stranger blew
into town last night. A detective.

07:45.199 --> 07:48.633
And get this.
He's a blackfella.

07:48.635 --> 07:51.002
What, Indian black
or African black?

07:51.004 --> 07:53.071
No, I mean blackfella black.

07:53.073 --> 07:55.407
Near as I could tell, anyhow.

07:55.409 --> 07:59.244
What's he doing here?
Ain't too sure yet.

07:59.246 --> 08:00.879
Well, find out.

08:02.248 --> 08:04.049
Hey.

08:06.819 --> 08:10.288
Apple?
'Course.

08:11.324 --> 08:14.526
And Josh? Remember.

08:16.863 --> 08:18.530
No worries.

09:39.812 --> 09:44.382
Mmm. Mmm. Yeah, I know.
What are we payin' em a fortune for?

09:44.384 --> 09:48.920
We should have had a contract
two fuckin' weeks ago.

09:48.922 --> 09:53.024
Look, if this thing falls through,
blame the fuckin' lawyers.

09:54.260 --> 09:57.996
No, I'm just saying if it did.

09:57.998 --> 10:01.600
Okay. Okay.

10:01.602 --> 10:04.903
Gidday, Josh.
Johnny.

10:04.905 --> 10:08.073
You want a soft drink? Beer?
No. No, thanks.

10:10.610 --> 10:13.144
Jeez, I hope the boys
weren't too much trouble.

10:13.146 --> 10:16.314
I've pretty well
had a gutful at this point.

10:16.316 --> 10:18.183
Yeah, no,
you know what they're like.

10:18.185 --> 10:19.818
Look, I don't have
the time for it anymore,

10:19.820 --> 10:22.354
so if you can't fix it,

10:22.356 --> 10:25.390
I'll have
to start charging people.

10:25.392 --> 10:27.659
Come on, Josh. Mate,
you know as good as anyone

10:27.661 --> 10:30.531
with no mine,
there is no pub, there's

10:30.532 --> 10:33.532
no Josh, there's
no fuckin' Goldstone.

10:33.533 --> 10:36.868
Without Furnace Creek,
we'd be a bloody piss stop

10:36.870 --> 10:39.971
on the highway to nowhere.

10:39.973 --> 10:43.041
You know, just like when
the blackfellas were in charge.

10:46.779 --> 10:52.384
You... you heard
of the new expansion license?

10:55.855 --> 10:59.724
Look, you've always
been a good supporter, Josh.

10:59.726 --> 11:03.762
You know, always been
looking for ways

11:03.764 --> 11:05.497
to show my appreciation.

11:09.168 --> 11:11.803
But this one's
major league, mate.

11:11.805 --> 11:15.106
We're talking
a few hundred million dollars

11:15.108 --> 11:17.776
worth of gold, probably more.

11:23.749 --> 11:27.018
I just need to know
if we can count on ya.

11:28.621 --> 11:30.588
Looks like a lot
of trees there, Johnny.

11:30.590 --> 11:34.125
Oh, mate,
that's just for starters.

11:37.229 --> 11:41.833
How about... how about
I look after it for ya

11:41.835 --> 11:45.170
since it's, you know,
it's your first time and all.

11:46.439 --> 11:48.640
Look, I better get back to it.

11:50.643 --> 11:56.314
All right. Yeah. You have a
good one, eh? Yeah, you too.

12:23.008 --> 12:24.342
Hey, old man.

12:26.278 --> 12:28.780
I was looking for Maria.

12:39.892 --> 12:41.326
Maria.

12:49.201 --> 12:51.603
Who are you?

12:51.605 --> 12:54.072
My name's Jay.

12:54.074 --> 12:55.907
About six months ago,

12:55.909 --> 12:59.344
your phone was used
to call a police hotline.

12:59.346 --> 13:02.413
It was about an Asian-looking
girl in the desert.

13:02.415 --> 13:05.450
Did you make the call?

13:09.155 --> 13:10.555
And is this her?

13:17.163 --> 13:20.031
Could be.

13:20.033 --> 13:21.800
Where'd you see her?

13:23.502 --> 13:28.540
Under that first tree,
heading out to town.

13:28.542 --> 13:33.545
And what was she doing?
Sittin' in the shade.

13:33.547 --> 13:35.748
Did she look
like she needed help?

13:49.061 --> 13:50.495
Who's that?

13:54.934 --> 13:57.235
Oh, that's Tommy.

13:57.237 --> 14:00.738
Big Land Council boss.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.703
Yeah, what?

15:40.773 --> 15:45.043
Well, fuckin' deal with it.

15:45.045 --> 15:49.047
Well, get onto Josh. Ask if
he knows anything about him.

15:49.049 --> 15:53.551
Right?

17:00.552 --> 17:03.921
Good evening, sir.

17:03.923 --> 17:05.623
Please, sit down.

17:11.964 --> 17:14.999
I'm Anne,
but you can call me Pinky.

17:16.935 --> 17:21.571
How long you been in town, Pinky?
A few days.

17:21.574 --> 17:26.644
I cruise in for a few weeks and then
I cruise out, just like you guys.

17:26.646 --> 17:31.416
Are you married?
Not anymore.

17:31.418 --> 17:36.187
I hear ya. Got kids?

17:36.189 --> 17:37.889
A beautiful girl.

17:41.760 --> 17:44.562
Yeah, she passed away last year.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.866
I'm sorry.

17:51.136 --> 17:55.773
Are you a single girl, Pinky?
Yeah, most of the time.

17:55.775 --> 18:01.112
You hear of things
happening out here?

18:02.347 --> 18:03.915
Are you a cop?

18:06.552 --> 18:08.052
Sometimes.

18:11.090 --> 18:14.092
I've heard... stories

18:14.094 --> 18:16.694
about girls getting
caught up in stuff.

18:16.696 --> 18:20.932
But you should know by now that
all roads lead to Furnace Creek.

18:20.934 --> 18:23.301
There's nothing else out here.

18:23.303 --> 18:27.238
I do know one thing for sure,

18:27.240 --> 18:31.442
and that's this land
ain't no place for a young girl.

18:50.329 --> 18:52.497
I'll be gentle.

18:52.499 --> 18:54.765
Maybe next time.

18:57.269 --> 18:59.871
There is...

18:59.873 --> 19:01.906
no...

19:01.908 --> 19:05.943
next... time.

19:48.287 --> 19:50.254
Fuck!

20:14.313 --> 20:18.950
Jeez, you don't
mess around, do ya?

20:30.395 --> 20:32.930
SGs.

20:34.466 --> 20:36.667
They meant business.

20:39.538 --> 20:41.105
You wanna make a statement?

20:42.941 --> 20:45.810
Are you gonna tell me
what you're doin' out here?

20:45.812 --> 20:48.613
I know you ain't
out here on no holiday.

20:50.449 --> 20:52.683
Who sent ya?

20:56.054 --> 20:57.622
Missing Persons.

21:06.031 --> 21:10.534
Well... I'm gonna tell ya now,

21:10.536 --> 21:14.238
there must be some mistake.

21:14.240 --> 21:17.942
We got no missing
persons out here.

21:20.112 --> 21:23.614
Seems to me like
a big old waste of time.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.983
You should probably just

21:25.985 --> 21:29.654
turn that old rust
bucket of yours around and...

21:29.656 --> 21:31.289
head back
to where you came from.

21:37.696 --> 21:39.764
That's for you.

21:42.000 --> 21:46.704
From the Region Commander.

21:46.706 --> 21:48.574
You wanna argue
about it, you can

21:48.575 --> 21:50.575
give 'em a call and
you can sort it out.

21:50.576 --> 21:54.045
But I'm guessing you don't want
any extra attention out here.

22:00.786 --> 22:02.820
Well, I can tell you now

22:02.822 --> 22:08.392
I ain't got time to be anybody's
cattle dog, especially yours.

22:08.394 --> 22:10.828
Anyway...

22:12.798 --> 22:15.933
old Ruby Rose,
she's as mad as hell.

22:15.935 --> 22:18.602
Wants you out of here
quick as a snail's fart.

22:18.604 --> 22:21.806
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

22:21.808 --> 22:24.175
Best get packin'.

22:43.662 --> 22:46.497
It's all off-grid.

22:46.499 --> 22:48.132
Gas fridge and stove.

22:54.306 --> 22:59.910
It's a bit rough,
but should be quiet enough.

22:59.912 --> 23:02.179
What's the old Winchester for?

23:05.717 --> 23:07.284
Mostly wild dogs.

23:10.055 --> 23:11.889
And whatever else
comes out of the desert.

23:11.891 --> 23:14.058
Ferals around here

23:14.060 --> 23:18.829
have been mixing
with the dingos.

23:18.831 --> 23:23.300
Making some crazy half-breed.

23:23.302 --> 23:26.237
Wilder than the purebreds.

23:26.239 --> 23:27.805
Twice as cunning.

23:32.377 --> 23:34.779
Just a word of warning.

23:36.615 --> 23:38.015
You see, out here...

23:38.017 --> 23:41.986
folks don't take
too kindly to outsiders.

23:43.455 --> 23:46.957
So if you do want
to go lookin' around,

23:46.959 --> 23:49.519
just be careful where you step.

23:50.862 --> 23:52.797
There's plenty of snakes about.

26:44.903 --> 26:47.037
Take your hands off your gun!

26:47.039 --> 26:48.672
Take your hands
off your fucking gun!

26:48.674 --> 26:49.907
Now drop to your knees slowly!

26:49.909 --> 26:51.375
Put your hands on your head.

26:51.377 --> 26:53.377
Put your hands
on your fuckin' head!

27:48.600 --> 27:49.767
Go.

28:02.213 --> 28:04.048
How're ya goin'?

28:04.050 --> 28:06.216
You can call me Johnny.

28:08.286 --> 28:10.988
Can I get you
a cold refreshment?

28:10.990 --> 28:13.624
You want a soft drink? Beer?

28:18.663 --> 28:20.967
Do you realize you were...

28:20.968 --> 28:23.968
intercepted well within
a restricted area?

28:23.969 --> 28:29.039
You know, it's a fuckin'
dangerous worksite out here.

28:29.041 --> 28:31.208
You know,
you could have been injured.

28:31.210 --> 28:33.644
Well, even worse than that.

28:33.646 --> 28:39.516
What were you doing out here?
I just got lost.

28:45.957 --> 28:49.793
You get lost much, Detective?

28:54.132 --> 28:57.134
And what'd you
see out there tonight?

29:00.238 --> 29:02.172
A beautiful sunset.

29:02.174 --> 29:06.443
Oh, beautiful sunset, yeah.

29:12.417 --> 29:18.021
You might wear a badge,
work for the Crown.

29:18.023 --> 29:20.090
So do we.

29:20.092 --> 29:22.860
The difference is that

29:22.862 --> 29:26.396
we keep this country
in business.

29:26.398 --> 29:29.199
See, it's all about...

29:29.201 --> 29:31.468
it's all about standards
of living, you know?

29:31.470 --> 29:34.641
We can't stop the wheel turning

29:34.642 --> 29:37.642
for anyone, including you.

29:38.743 --> 29:41.178
So I suggest...

29:41.180 --> 29:44.948
I suggest that you...
you get on your horse

29:44.950 --> 29:48.819
and ya fuckin' ride
out of here while ya can.

29:50.121 --> 29:51.722
Go on.

29:51.724 --> 29:54.224
Drive safe, though.

29:54.226 --> 29:56.860
Drive safe.

30:07.472 --> 30:09.273
Hooroo.

30:46.911 --> 30:49.379
Mayor's invited you
to morning tea.

30:52.116 --> 30:54.284
She'll be expecting ya.

31:02.694 --> 31:05.429
What were you doing out
at Furnace Creek last night?

31:05.431 --> 31:09.566
You just can't go
wanderin' round like that.

31:09.568 --> 31:11.768
You cross the border
at Furnace Creek, copper or not,

31:11.770 --> 31:13.770
they got their
rights to kill ya.

31:17.375 --> 31:19.877
You know what
goes on out there?

31:19.879 --> 31:22.246
What are you talking about?

31:22.248 --> 31:24.815
Talking about a plane
full of Asian girls.

31:28.152 --> 31:29.853
It's all done off-site.

31:29.855 --> 31:33.257
They fly in, they fly out.
It's all legal.

31:33.259 --> 31:36.393
You heard of trafficking?

31:38.229 --> 31:39.830
Jesus, Jay.

31:39.832 --> 31:42.332
Well, how do you know
they're not being trafficked?

31:42.334 --> 31:43.934
How do you know they are?

31:49.073 --> 31:51.575
Don't make no difference.

31:53.211 --> 31:56.914
That kind of shit
ain't my watch.

31:56.916 --> 31:58.615
Belongs to the Feds.

31:58.617 --> 32:01.518
Do you know where
they keep the girls?

32:03.321 --> 32:05.088
That ain't your concern.

32:05.090 --> 32:09.393
And why ain't it yours?

32:09.395 --> 32:12.195
You on the take?

32:12.197 --> 32:13.897
Part of the security team?

32:17.936 --> 32:19.870
What?

32:23.274 --> 32:25.943
You calling me
dirty there, Jay?

32:28.446 --> 32:30.881
That what you're doin'?

32:30.883 --> 32:32.950
Callin' me dirty?

32:32.952 --> 32:35.719
Who's letting the grog
into Broken River?

32:35.721 --> 32:39.723
It's a dry community
and it's soaking with piss.

32:39.725 --> 32:42.793
And it's on your watch.

32:42.795 --> 32:46.964
Askin' or callin',
whatever you want it to be.

33:17.695 --> 33:20.931
Brother boy.
Where you from?

33:23.034 --> 33:24.534
Oh, here and there.

33:25.970 --> 33:28.050
What were you
doing up at Broken River?

33:29.974 --> 33:31.842
Just lookin' around.

33:33.444 --> 33:37.481
Well, you see,
we got protocols out here.

33:37.483 --> 33:41.084
This is not your country
to go walkin' around on.

33:41.086 --> 33:44.421
You're a guest here.

33:44.423 --> 33:48.291
Just like the white man.

33:48.293 --> 33:51.128
You understand, brother boy?

34:09.547 --> 34:13.850
Mr. Swan. Come on in.

34:13.851 --> 34:14.951
Sit down.

34:18.121 --> 34:21.625
You can call me Maureen.

34:23.527 --> 34:24.928
Milk and sugar?

34:28.599 --> 34:32.335
Now, Mr. Swan...
Jay, isn't it?

34:32.337 --> 34:34.603
I'm going to call you Jay.

34:34.606 --> 34:38.341
I heard something
about a missing person.

34:38.342 --> 34:42.579
You see, there's not much
I don't know about

34:42.581 --> 34:44.581
when it comes to Goldstone.

34:46.217 --> 34:49.319
Now, out here, Jay,

34:49.321 --> 34:52.155
we run a very tight ship,

34:52.157 --> 34:57.094
where even the smallest stones
can cause mighty big ripples.

34:57.096 --> 35:00.797
And we don't take
too kindly to mob who come in

35:00.799 --> 35:03.467
and throw stones
with no reason.

35:03.469 --> 35:06.269
Young Josh is a good boy.

35:06.271 --> 35:11.741
Took him a while, but he understands
how this place works.

35:11.743 --> 35:15.946
So I suggest you keep
your head down,

35:15.948 --> 35:18.428
keep those waters
nice and still.

35:19.450 --> 35:21.118
Yeah?

35:21.120 --> 35:25.622
Oh, and this is for you.

35:28.559 --> 35:30.894
I was planning
to give you just one slice,

35:30.896 --> 35:32.629
but I thought, what the hell.

35:32.631 --> 35:35.365
Hope you got a sweet tooth.

35:35.367 --> 35:38.568
Thanks for the little chat.

35:38.570 --> 35:43.206
And if you need
anything, just ask.

35:43.208 --> 35:46.076
And I mean anything.

36:38.496 --> 36:41.765
Hey, Josh.
Gidday, Mick.

36:45.436 --> 36:49.406
Looking for a bit of love?
Oh, not tonight.

36:49.408 --> 36:51.908
Bit of business, actually.

36:51.910 --> 36:53.944
Oh, yeah,
what kind of business?

36:53.946 --> 36:57.147
You got foreign
workers here, yeah?

36:57.149 --> 36:59.482
Yeah, like usual.

36:59.484 --> 37:02.018
They got work visas?

37:02.020 --> 37:04.454
As far as I know.
Why, is there a problem?

37:04.456 --> 37:07.357
No, no, no.
No, just an inquiry.

37:07.359 --> 37:09.759
An inquiry?
Yeah.

37:09.761 --> 37:11.895
Yeah, I want to talk to 'em.

37:13.664 --> 37:16.233
What, now?
Yeah.

37:16.235 --> 37:18.568
Well, they're busy.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.

37:18.570 --> 37:20.203
Won't take long.

37:20.205 --> 37:22.405
You know, Josh,

37:22.407 --> 37:24.708
some people might
call this a raid.

37:24.710 --> 37:27.911
Come on, Mick,
it's not a big deal.

37:32.817 --> 37:37.153
Excuse us, Mick, Mrs. Lao.

37:47.265 --> 37:48.698
You girls speak English?

37:54.839 --> 37:58.742
Are any of you girls
here against your will?

38:02.580 --> 38:06.049
Has anybody threatened you
in any way?

38:12.157 --> 38:15.925
Are any of you being
forced to pay back money?

38:21.799 --> 38:23.800
Okay, thanks for your time.

38:31.575 --> 38:35.478
Today here we make history.

38:35.480 --> 38:41.184
Today we guarantee
your community's security.

38:41.186 --> 38:43.186
We're talking
about infrastructure.

38:43.188 --> 38:46.256
We're talking jobs and training.

38:46.258 --> 38:51.394
Getting those lost kids off the drugs
and into full-time jobs.

38:51.396 --> 38:54.431
Look, I know some of you
mob are worried about your...

38:54.433 --> 38:58.068
your sacred sites
and protecting your culture.

38:58.070 --> 39:01.604
But at Furnace Creek,
we pride ourselves

39:01.606 --> 39:06.676
on our environmental
and our cultural record.

39:06.678 --> 39:09.245
We hold our hands out

39:09.247 --> 39:14.284
to walk together down
this new pathway to the future

39:14.286 --> 39:19.956
with the approval of this
new exploration agreement.

39:19.958 --> 39:21.891
Let's just jump to it
and I'll invite

39:21.893 --> 39:25.061
the Broken River
council board members

39:25.063 --> 39:27.466
to come up here to give
their autographs

39:27.467 --> 39:29.467
of approval in front of
youse all here today.

39:29.468 --> 39:31.334
Thank you.

39:48.386 --> 39:49.452
Jimmy.

39:50.721 --> 39:51.988
Jimmy!

40:23.687 --> 40:25.255
Hey, old man.

40:30.728 --> 40:32.762
You want a ride?

40:49.847 --> 40:55.118
Lookin' for that girl?
Chinese one, eh?

40:55.120 --> 40:57.987
Yeah, you know something?

41:00.825 --> 41:04.360
My grandfather
saw first white man here.

41:04.362 --> 41:09.132
He come on a camel.
Then the Chinese men come.

41:09.134 --> 41:12.202
They said they all
look for the gold stone.

41:12.204 --> 41:16.739
And they follow the same God.

41:16.741 --> 41:18.842
Money god.

41:21.579 --> 41:24.981
I know why you came here.

41:24.983 --> 41:27.851
I know your face.

41:27.853 --> 41:30.186
Just like your father.

41:33.791 --> 41:35.124
What, you knew him?

41:35.126 --> 41:39.662
He be taken away
when he was a young boy.

41:39.664 --> 41:45.201
Then he came back a man
and he said he had a son.

41:49.840 --> 41:52.075
Must be you.

41:55.514 --> 41:57.547
See that bird?

41:59.950 --> 42:02.018
You hit 'em with the car.

42:06.690 --> 42:09.225
Next time you be careful.

42:09.227 --> 42:12.328
Look after him. Protect him.

42:12.330 --> 42:15.665
They need more time
to understand.

42:15.667 --> 42:20.236
But when you need him,
they save your life.

42:20.238 --> 42:22.071
They'll find the water,

42:22.073 --> 42:24.908
just the middle of nowhere,
in the desert.

42:24.910 --> 42:28.077
Clean water, too.

42:28.079 --> 42:34.017
Yep. I show you something.
What?

42:34.019 --> 42:37.320
What you really come here for.

42:38.622 --> 42:40.323
Don't worry, not far.

42:42.826 --> 42:44.861
That way.

44:01.005 --> 44:02.705
Hey.

44:09.780 --> 44:11.547
What's wrong?

44:13.550 --> 44:18.688
Well... I'm thinking
of gettin' out, Maureen.

44:19.957 --> 44:22.692
I'm thinking to quit
while I'm ahead.

44:22.694 --> 44:25.061
Quittin'?

44:25.063 --> 44:28.264
But Johnny, we're so close.

44:30.134 --> 44:32.468
Old Jimmy walked out
of the signing ceremony.

44:32.470 --> 44:37.340
What? Tommy told me there'd
be no problem with Jimmy.

44:37.342 --> 44:39.275
Yeah, well, he is.
He's a big fuckin' problem.

44:39.277 --> 44:42.945
Already told the suits down south
we've got the green light.

44:42.947 --> 44:44.380
Maybe he wants more money.

44:44.382 --> 44:45.715
I'll have a chat to Tommy.
No, no.

44:45.717 --> 44:47.417
He's the type you can't buy.

44:47.419 --> 44:50.119
You know,
he doesn't go to church.

44:50.121 --> 44:54.557
Hasn't touched a drop of the
grog we've been runnin' out there.

44:54.559 --> 44:57.160
The old ways are in his blood.

44:57.162 --> 44:59.462
Probably hold off
until he fuckin' dies.

45:01.465 --> 45:05.435
Maybe we could speed things up.

45:09.606 --> 45:11.641
What do you mean?

45:11.643 --> 45:13.676
You know what I mean.

45:15.846 --> 45:19.749
Fuckin' shit, no. No, no.

45:19.751 --> 45:25.655
Johnny, we got so much
at stake here, remember?

45:25.657 --> 45:28.257
Just leave it with me.

45:28.259 --> 45:31.260
I'll do everything.

45:31.262 --> 45:33.796
Okay? Okay, babe?

46:03.694 --> 46:07.130
Hey, Josh. Back again?

46:07.132 --> 46:08.898
Yeah, looks like it.

46:08.900 --> 46:13.503
Business or pleasure?
Pleasure.

47:03.654 --> 47:05.254
Where you from?

47:06.323 --> 47:10.359
A small town
a long way from here.

47:11.528 --> 47:13.563
You?

47:13.565 --> 47:16.866
A small town,
long way from here.

47:20.804 --> 47:22.572
What's your name?

47:24.041 --> 47:25.775
Mei.

47:27.211 --> 47:28.911
How'd you get here?

47:28.913 --> 47:32.281
It's a long story.

47:32.283 --> 47:35.318
It's okay.
You can trust me.

47:37.855 --> 47:39.722
You come here much?

47:41.992 --> 47:43.659
Sometimes.

47:44.862 --> 47:47.830
You don't look like
the others around here.

47:49.099 --> 47:50.766
How's that?

47:50.768 --> 47:54.237
You just look different.

47:54.239 --> 47:59.075
Nah, I'm just the same as them.

47:59.077 --> 48:01.878
Maybe I just didn't
start out that way, though.

48:01.880 --> 48:04.247
How did you?

48:04.249 --> 48:07.250
I don't know.

48:08.952 --> 48:14.423
Didn't do things
the way other folks did.

48:14.425 --> 48:18.861
I didn't believe
what other folks believed.

48:18.863 --> 48:22.331
What did you believe?

48:22.333 --> 48:25.368
Doesn't matter.

48:28.238 --> 48:30.539
That boy's long gone.

48:35.479 --> 48:37.680
So why all the questions, Mei?

48:39.549 --> 48:42.818
So I don't
have to answer yours.

48:42.820 --> 48:46.022
Clever girl.

48:48.325 --> 48:51.560
What do you really want,
Mr. Policeman?

48:51.562 --> 48:55.097
Need to know what's
going on out here.

48:55.099 --> 48:57.433
What do you think is going on?

48:58.368 --> 49:01.404
Not too sure yet.

49:01.406 --> 49:03.940
The truth can be
hard to find out here,

49:03.942 --> 49:06.375
especially once
the sun goes down.

49:08.078 --> 49:11.547
And when you find the truth,

49:11.549 --> 49:14.917
what will you do about it?

50:00.831 --> 50:04.266
<i>Yeah?
I got some information.</i>

50:04.268 --> 50:08.904
<i>About what? About what
the fuck's going on.</i>

50:08.906 --> 50:10.706
Who is this?

50:10.708 --> 50:14.043
<i>Meet me out
at Shadow Tree Crossroads.</i>

52:27.978 --> 52:29.211
What happened?

52:29.213 --> 52:32.681
Looks like the old man
tanked himself.

52:33.884 --> 52:36.585
How do you know that?

52:36.587 --> 52:39.155
'Cause I know
what it looks like.

52:43.560 --> 52:44.727
Except usually it's the kids.

52:44.729 --> 52:47.029
We had five in the last year.

52:51.769 --> 52:53.469
And I got a witness.

52:55.740 --> 52:59.909
Said he
came here fishin'.

52:59.911 --> 53:01.777
Saw old Jimmy
swinging from the tree,

53:01.779 --> 53:04.647
but... it was too late.

53:08.451 --> 53:10.219
Sadly.

56:22.445 --> 56:24.413
Josh!

56:26.983 --> 56:29.218
Oh, hope I'm not interrupting.

56:29.220 --> 56:32.521
I was just heading home
and I saw the car.

56:32.523 --> 56:34.356
No, you're all right, Maureen.

56:34.358 --> 56:36.959
I just heard about Jimmy.

56:36.961 --> 56:39.995
Shame, takin' his
own life like that.

56:39.997 --> 56:44.566
Yeah, I know. I didn't
think he was the type.

56:44.568 --> 56:48.971
Oh, it's often the way it goes.
Ones you least expect.

56:48.973 --> 56:53.776
Yeah.
Is there a problem?

56:53.778 --> 56:57.813
No, no, just... just procedure.

56:57.815 --> 56:59.848
I record all
the suicides we get.

56:59.850 --> 57:02.718
Oh, good. I want to make
sure there's no problems

57:02.720 --> 57:07.256
for the family getting a release so
they can go ahead with the burial.

57:07.258 --> 57:11.160
Can be really painful,
dragging these things out.

57:11.162 --> 57:14.596
Yeah, no worries.
No worries, Maureen. I'll...

57:14.598 --> 57:17.599
I'll get Max over in the morning
and I'll dress the body.

57:17.601 --> 57:20.202
Should be ready by tomorrow
afternoon. Oh, good, Josh.

57:20.204 --> 57:22.137
Appreciate it.
No worries.

57:22.139 --> 57:25.607
Oh, there's one other thing...

57:25.609 --> 57:31.246
Don't ya reckon Mr. Swan has
overstayed his welcome, eh?

57:32.382 --> 57:33.482
Yeah, I get your drift,

57:33.484 --> 57:36.285
but it might not be so easy.

57:36.287 --> 57:38.420
He's here on Federal authority.

57:39.756 --> 57:41.924
Joshua.

57:41.926 --> 57:46.328
Since when were you afraid
of a little authority?

57:47.497 --> 57:49.498
Talk later.

58:53.363 --> 58:56.999
I want you out of here,
pure and simple.

58:58.968 --> 59:01.303
I did some checkin'.

59:01.305 --> 59:03.572
I know why you
got sent out here.

59:05.375 --> 59:07.409
Because of the hornet's nest
you set on fire

59:07.411 --> 59:09.244
back in your hometown.

59:09.246 --> 59:14.082
I've gotta admit,
lookin' at you now,

59:14.084 --> 59:16.451
I wouldn't have thought
you had it in ya.

59:17.921 --> 59:20.155
Five men ended...

59:21.591 --> 59:24.226
pretty much single-handed.

59:25.995 --> 59:29.531
Jesus, you're
a dangerous man, Jay.

59:37.941 --> 59:42.110
I guess all that
blood on your hands...

59:42.112 --> 59:44.146
send anyone to drink.

59:51.487 --> 59:53.388
Ya ever loved anyone?

59:55.058 --> 59:56.992
What do you reckon?

59:57.994 --> 59:59.127
I reckon you're too gutless

59:59.129 --> 01:00:02.097
to do a lot of things.

01:00:02.099 --> 01:00:05.334
It's probably one of 'em.

01:00:05.336 --> 01:00:08.270
Just end in a big
fuckin' mess anyway.

01:00:09.272 --> 01:00:12.240
I reckon I'll just bypass it.

01:00:12.242 --> 01:00:15.744
Yeah, why not bypass
the whole fuckin' thing?

01:00:15.746 --> 01:00:19.114
But you already thought
about that more than once.

01:00:19.116 --> 01:00:23.352
Pulling that Glock out of your
holster and popping it in your mouth.

01:00:23.354 --> 01:00:27.422
Out here, all on your lonesome.

01:00:28.424 --> 01:00:30.359
Fuck you, Jay.

01:00:32.161 --> 01:00:35.097
Fuckin' bypass.

01:00:35.099 --> 01:00:37.666
Like this whole
fuckin' country.

01:00:42.472 --> 01:00:45.540
You think your missing girl's out
there, you go right on ahead.

01:00:45.542 --> 01:00:47.476
I won't stop ya.

01:00:47.478 --> 01:00:50.412
But you're chasin'
a fuckin' ghost, Jay.

01:00:52.982 --> 01:00:58.253
You got no witness
and you got no victim.

01:01:01.090 --> 01:01:02.691
No fuckin' crime.

01:01:08.097 --> 01:01:10.699
Belongs to the missing girl.

01:01:13.302 --> 01:01:15.037
Where'd you get it?
Doesn't matter.

01:01:15.039 --> 01:01:16.938
It's just a lost passport.

01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:19.508
Oh, it's just a lost passport.
What, just like an old man

01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:23.712
just killed himself...
on your watch.

01:01:38.027 --> 01:01:40.831
You think you or me
or anyone can

01:01:40.832 --> 01:01:42.832
make a difference to
any fuckin' thing?

01:01:42.833 --> 01:01:48.036
Think you really cleaned up
that town of yours?

01:01:48.038 --> 01:01:50.405
You might have
stirred up a bit of dirt,

01:01:50.407 --> 01:01:52.674
but it's just a matter
of time that the dust settles.

01:01:52.676 --> 01:01:56.411
Well, at least
it's a little bit thinner.

01:01:58.781 --> 01:02:02.918
You go out there, guns blazing,
they'll probably kill ya.

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:06.922
And all of this shit,
it'll just keep goin' round.

01:02:06.924 --> 01:02:10.792
And I'll be the one stuck on light
duties in some fuckin' hell hole.

01:02:13.362 --> 01:02:15.764
I thought you
were already there.

01:03:48.457 --> 01:03:51.793
Why did you come back?

01:03:51.795 --> 01:03:54.663
Still looking for the truth?

01:03:54.665 --> 01:03:56.198
Or something else?

01:03:58.201 --> 01:03:59.868
I don't know.

01:04:01.237 --> 01:04:07.142
Maybe... a lot of things.

01:04:07.144 --> 01:04:08.543
All at once.

01:04:15.151 --> 01:04:18.353
Why did you choose me
from the others?

01:04:20.690 --> 01:04:22.924
I guess something
just caught my eye.

01:04:25.127 --> 01:04:26.895
What something?

01:04:30.666 --> 01:04:35.503
You sure you are just
like the others, Mr. Policeman?

01:04:37.173 --> 01:04:39.040
What are you really doin' here?

01:04:39.042 --> 01:04:41.443
What do you think?

01:04:42.612 --> 01:04:44.312
I think you're pretending.

01:04:44.314 --> 01:04:47.382
Pretending what?

01:04:47.384 --> 01:04:49.718
To be like the others.

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:53.922
I do what they do.
Makes me no different.

01:04:55.258 --> 01:04:59.628
Just like you,
do like the others.

01:05:01.163 --> 01:05:02.864
Let me help you.

01:05:02.866 --> 01:05:06.501
Why do you think I need it?

01:05:06.503 --> 01:05:08.937
'Cause it's in your eyes.

01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:16.144
And why should I trust you?

01:05:16.146 --> 01:05:21.950
I'm giving you a choice...
to be who you wanna be.

01:05:23.185 --> 01:05:26.554
Maybe it's me...

01:05:26.556 --> 01:05:28.690
giving you the choice.

01:05:37.667 --> 01:05:40.769
If you need help,
press this green button.

01:05:43.372 --> 01:05:44.739
And I'll come.

01:05:45.775 --> 01:05:48.743
Then what will become of you?

01:05:59.789 --> 01:06:03.391
We are gathered today,
my brothers and sisters,

01:06:03.393 --> 01:06:06.361
to return our brother
Jimmy to mother earth.

01:06:06.363 --> 01:06:09.364
His life
is not destroyed by death.

01:06:09.366 --> 01:06:12.033
God has taken him
to eternal life.

01:06:12.035 --> 01:06:16.771
As we commend Jimmy to God
and commit his body to the earth

01:06:16.773 --> 01:06:21.476
let us express in prayer our
common faith in the resurrection.

01:06:21.478 --> 01:06:23.578
As Jesus Christ was
raised from the dead,

01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:26.748
we too are called
to follow him through death

01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:30.285
to the glory
of eternal life with God.

01:06:34.790 --> 01:06:36.925
Old Jimmy told me
all about you.

01:06:40.363 --> 01:06:43.031
He wanted me to give you this.

01:06:44.834 --> 01:06:47.535
Your father had two brothers.

01:06:47.537 --> 01:06:50.638
That's them at the
front there, on the side.

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:52.960
Your father's
the one at the end.

01:06:56.479 --> 01:06:58.046
What happened to them?

01:06:59.348 --> 01:07:01.616
Government sent people away.

01:07:01.618 --> 01:07:04.652
Far away from here.

01:07:04.654 --> 01:07:08.823
They must have been with 'em.

01:07:08.825 --> 01:07:11.860
There's a lot of families
out here won't accept you.

01:07:11.862 --> 01:07:16.865
They want to keep everything
for themselves.

01:07:16.867 --> 01:07:20.035
But old Jimmy
wanted you to know that...

01:07:21.637 --> 01:07:26.074
This mob... it's your mob.

01:07:27.343 --> 01:07:29.778
This land, you belong to it.

01:08:44.752 --> 01:08:49.624
Come in!

01:08:51.527 --> 01:08:54.162
Detective Swan.

01:08:54.163 --> 01:08:56.497
Cuppa tea?

01:09:06.242 --> 01:09:08.576
Grandchildren?

01:09:08.578 --> 01:09:12.212
Nah, I couldn't have kids.

01:09:12.215 --> 01:09:15.917
So I figured sponsors
was the next best thing.

01:09:21.890 --> 01:09:23.925
I heard you were
at Jimmy's funeral.

01:09:23.926 --> 01:09:27.828
Just plain terrible
what's happening out there.

01:09:27.831 --> 01:09:30.999
People taking their own lives.

01:09:31.001 --> 01:09:33.301
We lost a bunch
of kids last year.

01:09:33.303 --> 01:09:36.337
Yeah, I was speaking
to Jimmy's daughter, Maria.

01:09:36.339 --> 01:09:38.473
She must be devastated.

01:09:38.475 --> 01:09:41.276
Yeah, she was saying
Jimmy was gettin' pressure.

01:09:41.278 --> 01:09:46.080
Really? Who from?
The Land Council and Furnace Creek.

01:09:48.017 --> 01:09:53.254
I heard you caused a bit of commotion
back in your hometown.

01:09:53.256 --> 01:09:56.157
Is that right?

01:09:56.159 --> 01:09:59.561
I was just doin' my job.

01:09:59.563 --> 01:10:02.931
My daddy was a sheep farmer

01:10:02.933 --> 01:10:06.568
a long way south
and a little bit east of here.

01:10:06.570 --> 01:10:11.839
Fifty thousand acres
of the most desolate,

01:10:11.841 --> 01:10:15.343
driest land you've ever seen.

01:10:15.345 --> 01:10:18.046
Now, my daddy was a hard man,

01:10:18.048 --> 01:10:22.050
but my granddaddy...
he was from a different world.

01:10:22.052 --> 01:10:26.588
Nothing my daddy did could
ever please that old man.

01:10:26.590 --> 01:10:31.092
There was no pleasing
my daddy, either.

01:10:31.094 --> 01:10:35.763
When I heard he'd hanged himself in
the feed shed one October morning,

01:10:35.765 --> 01:10:38.766
I couldn't feel any sorrow.

01:10:38.768 --> 01:10:42.971
Couldn't find
a reason to miss him.

01:10:42.973 --> 01:10:45.873
And then it dawned on me.

01:10:47.509 --> 01:10:49.677
I was just like him.

01:10:49.679 --> 01:10:53.281
Daddy and Granddaddy,
the three of us.

01:10:53.283 --> 01:10:55.817
As hard as that trampled on,

01:10:55.819 --> 01:11:00.722
dried old earth
that we grew up on.

01:11:00.724 --> 01:11:04.259
So after skippin'
from town to town,

01:11:04.261 --> 01:11:06.894
marriage number five,

01:11:06.896 --> 01:11:09.097
I just let things go.

01:11:09.099 --> 01:11:13.735
Decided I just had
to look after number one.

01:11:15.704 --> 01:11:19.707
Now, I never
told anyone that before.

01:11:19.709 --> 01:11:21.376
But I reckon you
should think about it, Jay,

01:11:21.378 --> 01:11:26.281
'cause one day you might wake up
and find yourself lonely

01:11:26.283 --> 01:11:29.450
and old and poor,

01:11:29.452 --> 01:11:32.720
with nothin' to keep
you company but the flies

01:11:32.722 --> 01:11:35.122
'cause you left
the door half open.

01:11:37.092 --> 01:11:39.327
Now, here we are
being civilized

01:11:39.329 --> 01:11:41.229
to one another,

01:11:41.231 --> 01:11:42.630
but you and I both know

01:11:42.632 --> 01:11:44.913
things are gonna
change sooner or later.

01:11:45.801 --> 01:11:48.336
Don't get me wrong.

01:11:48.338 --> 01:11:51.005
I like you, Jay.

01:11:51.907 --> 01:11:53.708
Just don't take it personal

01:11:53.710 --> 01:11:56.744
when things turn
from ripe to rotten.

01:11:56.746 --> 01:12:00.248
'Cause that's how life is, Jay.

01:12:03.352 --> 01:12:05.219
Drive carefully.

01:12:35.184 --> 01:12:38.653
They bitin'?
Not like they used to.

01:12:38.655 --> 01:12:42.056
Nah, it's a shame.

01:12:47.963 --> 01:12:49.897
Aren't you gonna count it?

01:12:49.899 --> 01:12:53.067
No, I trust you.

01:12:53.069 --> 01:12:55.570
You shouldn't, ya know.

01:12:55.572 --> 01:12:59.874
You know that black cop's
been talkin' to Maria?

01:12:59.876 --> 01:13:04.645
Yeah, I know.
What he say?

01:13:04.647 --> 01:13:06.681
Nothin' much.

01:13:06.683 --> 01:13:09.884
It was more the way he said it.

01:13:09.886 --> 01:13:12.253
He's trying to get
something out of you.

01:13:12.255 --> 01:13:18.059
Well, you won't have
to worry about him anymore.

01:13:18.061 --> 01:13:20.228
What you gonna do about Maria?

01:13:20.230 --> 01:13:22.463
What do you want me to do?

01:13:22.465 --> 01:13:24.399
Keep her mouth shut.

01:13:26.869 --> 01:13:28.803
You're doin' the right thing.

01:13:28.805 --> 01:13:30.872
The past is the past.

01:13:30.874 --> 01:13:33.141
It's time for your people
to move on.

01:13:34.743 --> 01:13:36.477
Tommy?

01:13:37.746 --> 01:13:40.047
Are we right?

01:14:28.397 --> 01:14:30.097
What do you want?

01:14:31.233 --> 01:14:32.300
The passport.

01:14:34.336 --> 01:14:36.838
I just wanna know
where you found it.

01:14:38.173 --> 01:14:39.841
I don't want any trouble.

01:14:41.543 --> 01:14:45.313
If you just show me
where you found the passport,

01:14:45.315 --> 01:14:47.882
I'll leave you alone,
I promise.

01:14:56.792 --> 01:14:58.593
Up there.

01:14:58.595 --> 01:15:01.896
I was scratching around
and come across it by accident.

01:15:01.898 --> 01:15:03.798
You find anything else up there?

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:06.267
Just rubbish. Fool's gold.

01:15:07.736 --> 01:15:11.906
Seen some fuckin' bikies
'round here, shootin'.

01:15:11.908 --> 01:15:14.342
Shootin' what?
At wild dogs.

01:15:14.344 --> 01:15:16.344
Anything that fuckin'
moves or doesn't move.

01:15:16.346 --> 01:15:21.349
They even fuckin' shot up
me fuckin' mail box. Twice.

01:15:23.819 --> 01:15:25.319
Where'd they come from?

01:15:25.321 --> 01:15:28.956
Where do you
think they come from?

01:15:28.958 --> 01:15:32.126
Fuckin' Furnace fuckin' Creek.

01:18:15.023 --> 01:18:18.492
Mrs. Lao?
Yes?

01:18:18.494 --> 01:18:20.528
That's a lot of noodles
you've got there.

01:18:20.530 --> 01:18:21.829
Can I help you?

01:18:21.831 --> 01:18:23.764
Yeah, I was hoping I could
ask you a few questions.

01:18:23.766 --> 01:18:27.435
Sorry, I'm very busy. Yeah,
no worries. Won't take long.

01:18:29.805 --> 01:18:33.207
Did you ever have a girl out
there by the name of Zhang Mei?

01:18:34.309 --> 01:18:36.143
I can't remember.

01:18:36.145 --> 01:18:37.645
You sure?

01:18:39.181 --> 01:18:44.552
What do you want?
The truth.

01:18:44.554 --> 01:18:47.054
What's really
going on out there?

01:18:49.157 --> 01:18:51.058
What's always been going on.

01:19:09.111 --> 01:19:10.845
Tommy.

01:19:13.782 --> 01:19:15.549
Tommy.

01:19:17.786 --> 01:19:19.787
You all right?

01:19:22.591 --> 01:19:26.260
What do you
wanna do, Tommy?

01:19:28.163 --> 01:19:31.632
I wanna clean the dust away.

01:19:31.634 --> 01:19:33.367
Make it shine again.

01:19:40.742 --> 01:19:42.810
I wanna make a statement.

01:19:52.554 --> 01:19:55.156
How long's this been goin' on?

01:19:55.158 --> 01:19:58.058
You gotta sign the papers,
film people...

01:19:58.060 --> 01:19:59.894
Tommy, how much?

01:19:59.896 --> 01:20:03.330
The man, he wants some money
if you don't sign the paper...

01:20:08.703 --> 01:20:12.706
Tommy, what happened
with old Jimmy?

01:20:23.652 --> 01:20:26.620
I grab him
and I put the rope around him,

01:20:26.622 --> 01:20:29.857
took him, and I lift him up.

01:20:35.664 --> 01:20:37.198
All right.

01:22:12.994 --> 01:22:14.028
Hey, Josh.

01:22:15.230 --> 01:22:16.563
I want to see the girls.

01:22:16.565 --> 01:22:18.766
They're not here.
What do you mean

01:22:18.768 --> 01:22:20.534
they're not here?
Bring the fuckin' girls out.

01:22:20.536 --> 01:22:22.770
What are you doin' here, Josh?

01:22:33.782 --> 01:22:37.418
Where are they? What's wrong
with you? You know the rules.

01:22:37.420 --> 01:22:39.420
When's the next plane?

01:22:39.422 --> 01:22:41.488
Mayor's not going
to be happy about this.

01:24:41.209 --> 01:24:42.576
You okay there, Maureen?

01:24:42.578 --> 01:24:46.413
Josh,
you gave me a fright.

01:24:47.215 --> 01:24:48.682
You working on a Sunday?

01:24:49.551 --> 01:24:52.119
Yeah, just...

01:24:52.121 --> 01:24:54.088
tying up a few loose ends.

01:24:54.090 --> 01:24:55.789
What can I do for you, Josh?

01:24:55.791 --> 01:24:58.425
Well, Maureen,
I'll just get right to it.

01:24:58.427 --> 01:25:01.662
I know you're involved
in old Jimmy's death.

01:25:01.664 --> 01:25:03.931
You realize
what you're sayin', Josh?

01:25:03.933 --> 01:25:06.700
Cut the bullshit, Maureen.
Your hands are all over it

01:25:06.702 --> 01:25:08.235
and I can prove it.

01:25:08.237 --> 01:25:10.137
Just like I can prove
you've been on the take

01:25:10.139 --> 01:25:11.371
with Furnace Creek.

01:25:11.373 --> 01:25:13.373
Josh, I'm just an old woman

01:25:13.375 --> 01:25:14.942
who likes to bake pies.

01:25:14.944 --> 01:25:18.145
I've got 12 sponsor kids,
for Christ's sake.

01:25:19.514 --> 01:25:22.249
Whoever's got the girls,
I wanna meet 'em.

01:25:22.251 --> 01:25:23.717
And I wanna meet 'em now.

01:25:26.488 --> 01:25:29.323
Which girls?
Don't fuck with me, Maureen.

01:25:29.325 --> 01:25:33.694
Josh, I don't know what's gotten
into you. You're not yourself.

01:25:33.696 --> 01:25:35.762
I need you to set it up.

01:25:37.899 --> 01:25:42.703
How much do you
think your life's worth?

01:25:42.705 --> 01:25:46.340
There's billions
of dollars out there.

01:25:46.342 --> 01:25:48.410
How do you think that
compares with

01:25:48.411 --> 01:25:50.411
an old blackfella or
a lone Asian girl?

01:25:50.412 --> 01:25:53.380
A prostitute,
for Christ's sake.

01:25:53.382 --> 01:25:57.951
But I guess that's
just your style, isn't it?

01:25:57.953 --> 01:26:01.622
A copper who prefers to spend
his time with working girls.

01:26:01.624 --> 01:26:05.259
Not a good look for a young cop who
wants to step up in the world, is it?

01:26:06.528 --> 01:26:07.995
And those hands of yours,

01:26:07.997 --> 01:26:11.431
they may not be
as dipped as some,

01:26:11.433 --> 01:26:15.636
but they're not squeaky
clean either, are they, Josh?

01:26:15.638 --> 01:26:21.074
You set it up, or I'll get the
fuckin' Feds up here tomorrow.

01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:26.880
I'll need some bait.

01:26:26.882 --> 01:26:28.682
Tell 'em I want in.

01:26:28.684 --> 01:26:31.585
Do you really want in, Josh?

01:26:31.587 --> 01:26:34.721
Your own big slice of the pie?

01:26:34.723 --> 01:26:36.123
Make the call.

01:26:36.125 --> 01:26:37.991
Or I will.

01:28:59.367 --> 01:29:01.068
Josh.

01:29:01.936 --> 01:29:04.271
What's goin' on?

01:29:05.239 --> 01:29:07.599
You tell me what's goin' on.

01:29:09.944 --> 01:29:11.745
One sec.

01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:34.401
Can you do something
for us, mate?

01:29:35.770 --> 01:29:37.070
Yeah, what's that, mate?

01:29:37.072 --> 01:29:38.939
Just grab that
shovel over there.

01:29:38.941 --> 01:29:40.707
Make yourself useful.

01:29:45.213 --> 01:29:47.247
Don't.

01:29:58.426 --> 01:30:00.227
Let's go.

01:30:43.571 --> 01:30:47.707
You wanna get close,
this is how you do it.

01:30:47.709 --> 01:30:50.177
Make it nice and fuckin' big.

01:30:50.179 --> 01:30:52.512
Nothin' personal, Joshy.

01:30:53.848 --> 01:30:55.482
Just business.

01:31:15.470 --> 01:31:17.137
Hands on your head.

01:31:37.492 --> 01:31:39.326
Ah!

01:31:41.830 --> 01:31:43.463
Ahh!

01:32:47.128 --> 01:32:48.595
Are you sure you wanna do this?

01:35:33.327 --> 01:35:34.607
Ahh!

01:35:38.766 --> 01:35:40.166
Where are they?

01:35:40.168 --> 01:35:42.569
Who?
The girls.

01:35:42.571 --> 01:35:44.170
The laundry.

01:36:51.639 --> 01:36:53.406
Get on the ground!
Get on the ground now!

01:36:53.408 --> 01:36:55.708
On the ground!
On the fuckin' ground!

01:40:47.875 --> 01:40:50.395
Mayor's left town
without a trace.

01:40:51.311 --> 01:40:53.112
No sign of her yet.

01:40:54.681 --> 01:40:56.582
But you're free to go.

01:40:56.584 --> 01:40:58.785
The Feds have
taken over everything.

01:41:01.188 --> 01:41:04.424
It's all gone down
to the city with the girls.

01:41:04.426 --> 01:41:06.959
I'm just waiting
to see what happens.

01:41:19.139 --> 01:41:22.542
End up seeing any of them
wild dogs gettin' around?

01:41:24.912 --> 01:41:28.514
I seen somethin' out there,

01:41:28.516 --> 01:41:31.451
but I'm not sure what it was.

01:41:31.453 --> 01:41:33.820
But I do know it
was no bad thing.

01:41:37.691 --> 01:41:40.693
You know, growin' up
out here in the bush,

01:41:40.695 --> 01:41:43.362
I wouldn't
change it for anything.

01:41:43.364 --> 01:41:45.932
And I mean anything.

01:41:45.934 --> 01:41:50.803
But sometimes I can't help
but get this feelin' that...

01:41:54.141 --> 01:41:56.876
I coulda been...

01:41:58.045 --> 01:42:00.780
or I shoulda been...

01:42:00.786 --> 01:42:06.786
somethin' more than...
what I turned out.

01:42:08.722 --> 01:42:11.858
I tell myself not to listen.

01:42:12.659 --> 01:42:15.428
It's just this...

01:42:15.430 --> 01:42:18.731
small piece inside...

01:42:21.835 --> 01:42:24.737
that's cryin' out to be me.

01:42:30.310 --> 01:42:32.211
I'm gonna put in for a transfer.

01:42:35.482 --> 01:42:38.684
Somewhere by the ocean.

01:42:38.686 --> 01:42:42.054
Need to clean a bit
of this dust out of me, Jay.

01:42:44.424 --> 01:42:46.259
What about you?

01:42:46.261 --> 01:42:47.827
You headin' home?

01:42:55.802 --> 01:42:57.737
I guess.
