02:38.742 --> 02:41.160
Mrs. Peterson!

02:41.244 --> 02:43.579
Ramon, hey! How's it goin'?

02:43.664 --> 02:45.998
How you doin'?

02:46.083 --> 02:48.125
There it is,
right there on the desk.

02:48.210 --> 02:51.545
- Where's she headed?
- She's snowbound, Ramon.

02:55.425 --> 02:58.302
- See you went with the pink.
- Yeah, yeah.

02:58.387 --> 03:00.513
It's kind of a pink day today.

03:00.597 --> 03:03.474
I'm gonna have another pickup
for you on Thursday.

03:03.558 --> 03:05.726
- All right. We'll see you then.
- All right. Thanks, Ramon.

03:40.971 --> 03:43.639
Peterson! Peterson!

03:44.975 --> 03:47.059
Peterson.

03:49.646 --> 03:52.314
- Mr. Cowboy, da?
- Da.

03:56.820 --> 03:59.864
Mmm, it's pretty.

03:59.948 --> 04:03.033
Mmm. It's from my wife.

05:09.559 --> 05:11.519
Time...

05:11.603 --> 05:13.938
rules over us without mercy...

05:14.022 --> 05:17.775
not caring if we're healthy or ill,
hungry or drunk...

05:17.859 --> 05:21.487
Russian, American,
beings from Mars.

05:21.571 --> 05:24.490
It's like a fire.
It could either destroy us or keep us warm.

05:24.574 --> 05:27.243
That's why every FedEx office
has a clock.

05:27.327 --> 05:30.162
Because we live or we die
by the clock.

05:30.247 --> 05:32.164
We never turn our back on it.

05:32.249 --> 05:34.291
And we never, ever
allow ourselves...

05:34.376 --> 05:37.670
the sin of losing track
of time!

05:37.754 --> 05:39.839
Locally, it's 1:56.

05:39.923 --> 05:43.759
That means we've got
three hours and four minutes...

05:43.844 --> 05:45.761
before the end-of-the-day's
package sort.

05:45.846 --> 05:48.014
That's how long we have.
That's how much time we have...

05:50.267 --> 05:53.185
before this pulsating, accursed,
relentless taskmaster...

05:53.270 --> 05:55.855
tries to put us
out of business.

05:55.939 --> 05:59.024
Hey, Nicolai. Hey.
Nicolai, good to see you.

05:59.109 --> 06:00.985
How are you, kid?
Look what you did.

06:01.069 --> 06:03.195
You just delivered
your very first FedEx package.

06:03.280 --> 06:06.866
That deserves something special,
like a Snickers bar...

06:06.950 --> 06:09.785
and a C.D. player.

06:09.870 --> 06:11.787
And something to listen to...
a C.D. There.

06:11.872 --> 06:14.665
Elvis Presley. Fifty million fans
can't be wrong.

06:14.749 --> 06:16.667
You all recognize this,
don't you?

06:16.751 --> 06:19.461
I took the liberty
of sending this to myself.

06:19.546 --> 06:24.508
I FedEx'd it
before I left Memphis.

06:24.593 --> 06:26.719
You're probably wondering
what could be in here.

06:26.803 --> 06:29.138
What could it possibly be?
Is it architectural plans?

06:29.222 --> 06:31.140
Maybe technical drawings?

06:31.224 --> 06:33.976
Is this the new wallpaper
for the... for the bathroom?

06:36.062 --> 06:38.814
It is... a clock...

06:38.899 --> 06:40.816
which I started
at absolute zero...

06:40.901 --> 06:45.863
and is now at 87 hours,
22 minutes and 17 seconds.

06:45.947 --> 06:50.826
From Memphis, America
to Nicolai in Russia, 87 hours.

06:50.911 --> 06:54.121
Eighty-seven hours
is a shameful outrage.

06:54.205 --> 06:57.249
This is just an egg timer!

06:57.334 --> 07:00.085
What if it had been something else?
Like your paycheck?

07:00.170 --> 07:01.734
Or fresh boysenberries?
Or adoption papers?

07:03.381 --> 07:05.424
Eighty-seven hours
is an eternity.

07:05.508 --> 07:07.468
The cosmos was created
in less time!

07:07.552 --> 07:10.346
Wars have been fought and
nations toppled in 87 hours!

07:10.430 --> 07:12.348
Fortunes made and squandered.

07:16.561 --> 07:18.479
What?

07:18.563 --> 07:20.481
What are you saying about me?

07:20.565 --> 07:22.483
I tell them,
what do they expect?

07:22.567 --> 07:26.278
This man, when his truck broke down, he
stole a boy's bicycle to do his delivery.

07:26.363 --> 07:29.073
I borrowed it!
I borrowed a kid's bike.

07:29.157 --> 07:30.742
And I got my packages
delivered, and that is

07:30.743 --> 07:32.326
what you people are gonna
have to start doing.

07:32.410 --> 07:35.955
You have to start doing whatever it takes,
because in three hours and two minutes...

07:36.039 --> 07:39.124
every one of these packages
has to be on the big truck...

07:39.209 --> 07:41.126
and on its way to the airport.

07:41.211 --> 07:43.754
Fifteen minutes!

07:43.838 --> 07:47.132
- Crunch time! Crunch time!
- Crunch time!

07:47.217 --> 07:50.469
Let's go! Every package
on the airport truck.

07:50.553 --> 07:52.638
Go! Crunch, crunch, crunch!

07:52.722 --> 07:54.640
- We have a big problem.
- What?

07:54.724 --> 07:57.434
- The truck in Red Square is stuck.
- What do you mean?

07:57.519 --> 08:00.145
- It's stuck.
- Stuck how? In snow? In ice?

08:00.230 --> 08:03.732
It's stuck! The most important truck...
the Kremlin truck! Many packages.

08:13.743 --> 08:16.078
All right, all right, all right.
Let's put the table right here.

08:16.162 --> 08:18.080
We'll just do the sort.

08:18.164 --> 08:21.333
Ah, yeah, a clamp.
That would make us stuck.

08:21.418 --> 08:24.003
Let's go. Unload...
Get him out of there.

08:24.087 --> 08:26.630
Right here.
Two lines, two lines.

08:26.715 --> 08:29.591
One to the airport truck,
one to the Moscow truck.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.343
Got it?

08:31.428 --> 08:35.014
C.D.G., F.E., M.E, Memphis on the airport
truck. Everything else right there.

08:35.097 --> 08:37.765
Nicolai! Tick-tock, tick-tock.
Four minutes.

08:40.102 --> 08:42.688
- Hi, this is Kelly.
- If you're calling for Chuck, press one.

08:42.772 --> 08:44.940
Otherwise leave a message
after the tone. Thanks.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.026
Hello, Kelly. Are you there?

08:47.110 --> 08:49.611
Pick up, pick up, pick up,
pick up. You're not there.

08:49.696 --> 08:52.698
You're not gonna believe this. I'm doin'
the sorts in the middle of Red Square...

08:52.782 --> 08:54.700
in the shadow of Lenin's tomb.

08:58.913 --> 09:01.749
I'm outta here in two minutes and I'm
pickin' up the sweep through Paris...

09:01.833 --> 09:04.418
so I should be back in Memphis
about 18 hours or so.

09:04.502 --> 09:06.628
That's the good news.
The bad news is...

09:06.713 --> 09:08.630
I gotta go to
the dentist this week.

09:08.715 --> 09:10.674
I got something in there
that's hurtin'.

09:10.759 --> 09:13.552
I love you and I'm gonna see you soon,
and you know what that means.

09:13.636 --> 09:16.305
Bye-bye. Nicolai! Tick-tock, tick-tock,
tick-tock, tick-tock!

09:35.868 --> 09:37.826
I absolutely, positively have
to get to Memphis tonight.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.953
Can't help you. Try U.P.S.

09:40.038 --> 09:42.706
With this extra head wind, are we gonna
be able to push it and make the sort?

09:42.791 --> 09:45.167
- We'll do our best.
- "Our best," huh?

09:45.251 --> 09:47.378
Gwen, is there something
wrong with our doctors

09:47.379 --> 09:49.505
that Jack keeps getting
certified to fly?

09:49.589 --> 09:51.924
- Aren't you concerned?
- I'm terrified.

09:52.008 --> 09:53.967
But a girl's gotta do
what a girl's gotta do.

09:54.052 --> 09:56.929
That's the spirit.
Relentless is our goal. Relentless!

09:57.013 --> 10:00.182
What do you expect from the guy
who stole a crippled kid's bicycle...

10:00.266 --> 10:02.601
- when his truck broke down?
- I borrowed it.

10:02.685 --> 10:04.812
But I love that
the kid's now crippled.

10:04.896 --> 10:07.397
So you missed the last truck
by two minutes?

10:07.482 --> 10:10.359
Two minutes.
Actually, it was less than that.

10:10.443 --> 10:13.362
The plane wasn't that heavy.
You could've added some fuel...

10:13.446 --> 10:15.364
picked up the speed
and made up the time.

10:15.448 --> 10:18.617
It's about the trucks.
Today's truck was two minutes late.

10:18.701 --> 10:21.703
Tomorrow's will be four minutes late, and
then six minutes and eight minutes late.

10:21.788 --> 10:25.791
- Next thing you know, we're the U.S. Mail.
- Yeah, well...

10:25.875 --> 10:28.377
All I'm sayin' is, if you'd gotten
all those trucks on the plane...

10:28.461 --> 10:31.213
those Russkies would be
walking on water right now.

10:31.297 --> 10:33.757
Hey, don't...
Don't gimme that look.

10:33.842 --> 10:36.301
- It's just grape juice. Right, Chuck?
- Yeah.

10:36.386 --> 10:39.471
It's like a 1992
full-bodied grape juice.

10:39.556 --> 10:41.807
I see no evil, hear no evil,
speak no evil.

10:41.891 --> 10:45.227
We'd offer you some but, you know,
somebody's got to fly the plane.

10:45.311 --> 10:48.772
Yeah, well,
I "just say no," right?

10:48.857 --> 10:51.650
Listen, Stan,
I've been meaning to ask you.

10:51.734 --> 10:53.777
How's Mary?

10:53.862 --> 10:57.156
Oh. Uh, well...

10:57.240 --> 11:00.325
- we really don't know anything yet.
- Mm-hmm.

11:00.410 --> 11:05.289
Uh, she went to the doctor yesterday,
and, uh...

11:05.373 --> 11:09.168
it hasn't meta...
metastasized...

11:09.252 --> 11:12.212
as far as they
can tell right now.

11:12.297 --> 11:15.215
It's just kind of wait and see.

11:15.300 --> 11:17.509
I'm so sorry.

11:17.594 --> 11:20.804
Tell her I'm gonna come by
and see her on my next layover.

11:20.889 --> 11:24.183
I want you to know, Stan, we are
all thinking about her and you.

11:24.267 --> 11:26.977
- And just blessings.
- Thank you, Gwen.

11:27.061 --> 11:29.688
Hi, this is Kelly.
If you're calling for Chuck, press one.

11:29.772 --> 11:32.691
Otherwise, leave a message
after the tone. Thanks.

11:37.947 --> 11:40.657
Stan.

11:40.742 --> 11:43.202
Listen.
Uh, I heard about this...

11:44.954 --> 11:48.165
I heard about this doctor
down in Emory, in Atlanta.

11:48.249 --> 11:50.167
Uh, he's supposed to be
the absolute best.

11:50.251 --> 11:52.336
He worked on
Frank Toretta's wife.

11:52.420 --> 11:54.338
Frank Toretta is
a systems analyst.

11:54.422 --> 11:56.882
He played center field for us.
You know him.

11:56.966 --> 11:59.635
In the softball tournament
last Labor Day.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.553
Anyway, beside the point.

12:01.638 --> 12:06.225
Uh, what I was thinking is,
is that I could get his number...

12:06.309 --> 12:08.894
the doctor... and, uh...

12:08.978 --> 12:11.480
you know,
put you all together and...

12:12.982 --> 12:15.400
You know, you could
get this thing fixed.

12:15.485 --> 12:17.444
You could beat it.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.697
Thanks, Chuck.

12:20.782 --> 12:23.242
So, I'll get his number.

12:45.640 --> 12:49.559
- Is Kelly Frears around?
- She's copying her dissertation.

13:21.050 --> 13:23.427
- You're home.
- Home indeed.

13:23.511 --> 13:25.429
I love that you're home.

13:43.406 --> 13:45.992
Just days before Santa

13:45.993 --> 13:48.577
departs on his annual
gift-giving venture...

13:48.661 --> 13:51.580
he's been declared
physically fit to fly.

13:51.664 --> 13:55.500
Santa got checked out by doctors
at the V.A. Hospital in Augusta, Georgia.

13:55.585 --> 13:58.420
After they declared
the jolly old elf in tiptop shape...

13:58.504 --> 14:02.007
Santa Claus took off into the wild
blue yonder for an early start.

14:02.091 --> 14:04.593
In Sarajevo,
he spent the day with children...

14:04.677 --> 14:07.512
handing out presents and
even helping them decorate...

14:07.597 --> 14:09.556
the special Christmas tree.

14:13.686 --> 14:16.063
Santa and a sea of elves
took over the floor...

14:16.147 --> 14:18.065
at the Hong Kong
Futures Exchange.

14:18.149 --> 14:20.525
Market traders
bought Santa hats, donating...

14:43.091 --> 14:45.050
The turkey's a little dry,
isn't it?

14:45.134 --> 14:47.636
- No.
- The turkey is perfect.

14:51.474 --> 14:54.726
- How many did you do last night?
- Last night? 2.9 million.

14:54.811 --> 14:58.397
Now you've got to be in the market
for more of these candied yams.

14:58.481 --> 14:59.898
Here you go.

14:59.982 --> 15:01.942
2.9 has got to be the record.

15:02.026 --> 15:03.944
Look at those marshmallows.

15:04.028 --> 15:06.029
When I was there,
we did two million.

15:06.114 --> 15:08.615
- We thought that was a big deal.
- The glory days.

15:08.699 --> 15:11.243
- What'd they do the first night?
- The very first night?

15:11.327 --> 15:13.245
- Twelve.
- Twelve thousand?

15:13.329 --> 15:15.997
- Hell, no. Twelve.
- That's right.

15:16.082 --> 15:18.834
And they did the sort
right there on a card table.

15:18.918 --> 15:21.628
And Fred Smith had
that card table bronzed.

15:21.712 --> 15:24.423
I've been hearing that
for five years.

15:24.507 --> 15:26.592
It's in his office today.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.677
They go from that to the
new hub up in Anchorage.

15:28.761 --> 15:30.679
It's state of the art...
a perfect marriage...

15:30.763 --> 15:33.223
between technology
and systems management.

15:33.307 --> 15:36.059
Speaking of marriage, Chuck, when are you
gonna make an honest woman out of Kelly?

15:38.479 --> 15:41.314
- How long?
- Fourteen minutes into the meal.

15:41.399 --> 15:44.651
- You won. I owe you $5.
- So I win.

15:44.735 --> 15:46.736
- Way before the pie.
- I told him on the way up.

15:46.821 --> 15:49.948
Right about the time the pie
came out, the marriage...

15:50.032 --> 15:53.034
Kelly is still recovering from her failed
relationship with that parolee.

15:53.119 --> 15:55.287
He was a lawyer.

15:55.371 --> 15:57.622
I knew it had something to do
with raising your right hand...

15:57.707 --> 15:59.624
and swearing to tell the truth.

15:59.709 --> 16:01.252
Remember when he fell
on the sidewalk and

16:01.253 --> 16:02.794
broke his shoulder at
the wedding reception?

16:02.879 --> 16:05.630
He tripped on a curb
holding a door open for me.

16:05.715 --> 16:09.050
- Aunt Kelly was married before?
- It's not even worth remembering.

16:09.135 --> 16:12.012
So since her failed marriage
to the parolee...

16:12.096 --> 16:14.598
Oh, my God.

16:14.599 --> 16:17.100
Kelly can't see being with a
man who wears a pager to bed.

16:17.185 --> 16:19.144
What're you gonna
attach it to, Hoss?

16:19.228 --> 16:22.105
When you wear it to bed, I hope
you got one of those things...

16:22.190 --> 16:24.024
that go vibratin'.

16:24.108 --> 16:26.526
Watch it.
I'm not touching that.

16:26.611 --> 16:29.988
Oh, did you hit an olive pit?

16:30.072 --> 16:34.326
- I thought I took all of them out.
- No, no, it's not that.

17:00.686 --> 17:02.938
- Okay, I'll cancel Saturday.
- No, don't.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.940
If I'm not here, I'm not.
But if I am, well...

17:05.023 --> 17:06.942
- then I am.
- It's cancelled.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.944
But you gotta be here
New Year's Eve.

17:09.028 --> 17:11.445
Malaysia can't be that bad.
I'll be here New Year's Eve.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.990
- When are you defending your dissertation?
- January 12.

17:14.075 --> 17:18.494
I'm gonna have to switch
over the South America thing.

17:18.579 --> 17:20.914
If I do that
on the third or fourth...

17:20.998 --> 17:22.915
I'm gonna have to head
back out on the 13th.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.210
So long as you're here
New Year's Eve.

17:25.294 --> 17:28.296
I will be here New Year's Eve.
I promise.

17:31.592 --> 17:33.782
What?

17:33.783 --> 17:35.971
What about our Christmas?
I got a gift for you.

17:38.641 --> 17:41.184
We have to do it in the car.

17:46.482 --> 17:49.568
I'd just like a minute
over here, all right? Thanks.

17:56.158 --> 17:58.493
Two minutes, okay?

17:58.578 --> 18:01.121
Two more minutes. Thanks. Hey!

18:01.205 --> 18:03.665
- Merry Christmas.
- I thought you were gonna stiff me.

18:03.749 --> 18:05.146
No.

18:05.147 --> 18:06.543
- What is the ribbon?
Is it a thousand-pound...

18:06.627 --> 18:09.963
- test fishing line or something?
- Here's your fancy thing.

18:10.047 --> 18:12.799
Thanks.

18:15.678 --> 18:17.846
I love the wrapping.

18:19.473 --> 18:21.474
- And I love the box.
- Good.

18:24.186 --> 18:28.231
Oh. Oh, my.

18:29.358 --> 18:31.276
Oh, that is terrific.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.862
My grandaddy used it
on the Southern Pacific.

18:36.532 --> 18:40.535
Hey, I took this. This is
my favorite picture of you.

18:42.163 --> 18:45.081
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm always gonna keep this...

18:45.166 --> 18:47.876
on Memphis time.

18:50.713 --> 18:52.631
Kelly time.

18:52.715 --> 18:54.758
Hmm.

18:54.842 --> 18:56.801
You haven't said anything about
your presents. Is there a problem?

18:56.886 --> 18:58.970
I'm sorry, no! I love 'em.

18:59.055 --> 19:01.264
Look at my journal. Ah!

19:01.349 --> 19:05.101
- What about the pager?
- Real leather. The pages have gold on 'em.

19:05.186 --> 19:07.228
- Did you like the pager or not?
- Yes.

19:07.313 --> 19:11.066
I love it. Look at him in
his little blue Russian house.

19:11.150 --> 19:14.027
- It's from Russia.
- My God.

19:14.111 --> 19:17.572
- It's not one of those loud ones?
- No. You can program it so it vibrates...

19:17.657 --> 19:20.241
and lights up
and see it in the dark.

19:20.326 --> 19:24.371
It seems like
a real nice pager.

19:24.455 --> 19:26.290
Sorry about the hand towels.
You're hard to shop for.

19:26.291 --> 19:28.124
No, no. I love 'em.

19:28.209 --> 19:30.231
Every time I wash my hands,
I will think of you.

19:30.232 --> 19:32.253
All right, I gotta go.

19:32.338 --> 19:36.257
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

19:36.342 --> 19:38.259
- I love you.
- I love you too.

19:45.810 --> 19:48.603
Chuck! Keys!

19:58.531 --> 20:01.658
- Thank you.
- That reminds me. I almost forgot.

20:01.742 --> 20:05.161
I have one more present
for you.

20:05.246 --> 20:10.375
Only this isn't an "open in the car"
kind of present...

20:10.459 --> 20:12.377
like, say, hand towels.

20:12.461 --> 20:14.921
Which were a joke, by the way.

20:19.135 --> 20:21.678
I'm terrified.

20:21.762 --> 20:24.848
Just take it and hold onto it,
and you can open it...

20:24.932 --> 20:27.559
on New Year's Eve.

20:27.643 --> 20:29.602
And I love you.

20:33.399 --> 20:36.151
I'll be right back.

21:20.070 --> 21:22.614
Hey, Al, where are we?

21:22.698 --> 21:24.657
Somewhere over
the Pacific Ocean.

21:24.742 --> 21:27.285
Ha, ha, ha!
You pilots, you're funny.

21:27.369 --> 21:29.662
Tahiti Control, FedEx 88.

21:29.747 --> 21:32.582
Position Jenna at 1526...

21:32.666 --> 21:35.627
Is all this turbulence from Santa
and those eight tiny reindeer?

21:35.711 --> 21:38.296
Tamara at 1620.

21:38.380 --> 21:40.632
Erick is next.

21:40.716 --> 21:43.343
Fuel: niner-five-decimal-five.

21:43.427 --> 21:45.678
Blaine, tell them we're
deviating south for weather.

21:45.763 --> 21:48.139
Make another position plot
on your deviation left.

21:48.224 --> 21:50.642
Tahiti Control,
FedEx 88.

21:50.726 --> 21:53.394
Position Jenna at 1526.

21:53.479 --> 21:55.855
- Flight level 350.
- I got us plotted.

21:55.940 --> 21:58.858
We're 200 miles south
of our original course.

21:58.943 --> 22:01.653
Continue plotting,
and check contingency procedures.

22:01.737 --> 22:03.696
Tahiti Control, FedEx 88.

22:03.781 --> 22:06.199
Broadcasting in the blind.
How do you read?

22:07.493 --> 22:08.701
I've never been
out of comm this long.

22:08.786 --> 22:11.830
Did you try the higher
H.F. frequency?

22:11.914 --> 22:14.374
Tahiti Control, FedEx 88.

22:14.458 --> 22:17.377
Better buckle up, Chuck.
It's gonna get bumpy.

22:17.461 --> 22:20.296
Tahiti Control, FedEx 88.

22:20.381 --> 22:22.465
Do you read?

22:31.016 --> 22:33.017
Tahiti Control, FedEx 88.

22:33.102 --> 22:36.020
Position Jenna at 1526.

22:36.105 --> 22:38.147
Flight level 350.

22:38.232 --> 22:40.149
Expecting Tamara at 1...

23:21.317 --> 23:24.402
Fire! Explosion!

23:24.486 --> 23:26.404
Let's get a hose!

23:28.490 --> 23:32.327
Hold on to it! Come on!

23:34.580 --> 23:36.664
Seat belt!

23:42.963 --> 23:45.840
We may have to ditch!

23:55.351 --> 23:57.393
Okay?

23:58.187 --> 23:59.812
Fire in the hold!

23:59.897 --> 24:01.898
We're goin' down!

24:01.982 --> 24:04.359
Mayday! Mayday!

24:14.870 --> 24:17.205
Bringing it down and out!

24:17.289 --> 24:20.291
Ten thousand feet! Masks off!

24:20.376 --> 24:22.710
Masks off!

24:24.964 --> 24:28.049
Chuck! Life vest!

24:59.999 --> 25:02.834
Chuck! Chuck, stay there!

25:02.918 --> 25:05.795
Where's your life vest?

25:29.486 --> 25:31.446
Ditching switch on!

25:45.461 --> 25:48.254
I've got visual!

25:52.342 --> 25:54.802
Brace for impact!

34:47.043 --> 34:49.295
Hello!

36:30.647 --> 36:33.107
Hello!

36:33.191 --> 36:35.109
Anybody!

36:46.746 --> 36:48.789
Anybody!

36:53.294 --> 36:58.090
Help!

39:04.968 --> 39:06.927
What is that?

39:10.181 --> 39:12.558
Hey!

39:24.153 --> 39:26.071
Hey!

39:26.155 --> 39:28.740
Anybody?

43:40.326 --> 43:42.452
Hello?

47:36.062 --> 47:39.314
Get! Go, go. Go! Go!

48:37.248 --> 48:40.208
"Albert R. Miller."

48:40.292 --> 48:43.503
Not Alan. Albert.

50:04.043 --> 50:06.294
So, that's it.

53:02.262 --> 53:04.305
Hey! A ship!

53:04.390 --> 53:08.643
Hey! Hey!

53:08.727 --> 53:11.104
A ship! Over here!

53:11.188 --> 53:14.440
Hey! Hey!

53:14.525 --> 53:17.318
Over here! Over here!

53:22.866 --> 53:24.784
Over here!

53:24.868 --> 53:28.454
Over here! Over here!

53:28.539 --> 53:31.124
Help me! Help!
Right here! Right here!

53:31.208 --> 53:33.126
Help! Look here!
Look, look, look!

53:33.210 --> 53:38.172
S... O... S! Please!

53:38.257 --> 53:41.134
Help! Come on!

53:41.218 --> 53:42.927
Help!

01:02:44.552 --> 01:02:46.512
"Happy birthday."

01:02:48.515 --> 01:02:52.643
"The most beautiful thing in the world is,
of course, the world itself.

01:02:52.727 --> 01:02:56.855
Johnny, have the happiest birthday ever.
Score. Your Grandpa."

01:04:54.099 --> 01:04:56.016
Ew.

01:06:05.044 --> 01:06:07.254
Come on.

01:06:07.338 --> 01:06:14.011
Come on. Come on.

01:10:44.824 --> 01:10:47.909
You wouldn't have a match...
by any chance, would you?

01:10:52.248 --> 01:10:54.166
Oh, oh, oh!

01:11:09.390 --> 01:11:11.600
The air got to it.

01:11:11.684 --> 01:11:13.602
The air got to it!

01:11:56.270 --> 01:11:59.689
Come on, come on. Come on.

01:12:04.737 --> 01:12:06.822
I did it. I did it.

01:12:10.993 --> 01:12:12.994
Fire!

01:12:13.079 --> 01:12:15.205
There you go!

01:12:15.289 --> 01:12:17.332
Light it up! Come on!

01:12:20.002 --> 01:12:24.673
Ouch!

01:12:38.938 --> 01:12:41.940
Here you go! Here you go!

01:12:42.024 --> 01:12:44.276
It's a signal fire!

01:12:45.528 --> 01:12:48.780
And it spells out S.O.S!

01:12:48.865 --> 01:12:50.740
Whoa!

01:12:51.951 --> 01:12:54.202
It's a meteor shower!

01:12:54.287 --> 01:12:56.204
Fireflies! Go! Run!

01:12:56.289 --> 01:12:59.207
You're free! You're free!
Ouch! Ouch!

01:12:59.292 --> 01:13:01.209
Yeah!

01:13:01.294 --> 01:13:03.545
Yes!

01:13:03.629 --> 01:13:06.089
Look what I have created!

01:13:06.173 --> 01:13:08.341
I have made fire!

01:13:08.426 --> 01:13:11.803
I... have made fire!

01:13:23.774 --> 01:13:25.692
Mmm!

01:13:32.658 --> 01:13:34.576
You gotta love crab.

01:13:36.787 --> 01:13:38.705
In the nick of time too.

01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:43.710
I couldn't take much more
of those coconuts.

01:13:43.794 --> 01:13:45.879
Coconut milk's
a natural laxative.

01:13:47.965 --> 01:13:50.842
Things that Gilligan
never told us.

01:13:50.927 --> 01:13:52.844
Oh.

01:14:04.857 --> 01:14:07.108
Pretty well-made fire,
huh, Wilson?

01:14:15.117 --> 01:14:18.453
So... Wilson.

01:14:18.537 --> 01:14:20.789
We were en route...

01:14:20.873 --> 01:14:24.960
from Memphis
for 11 and a half hours.

01:14:25.044 --> 01:14:29.005
About 475 miles an hour.

01:14:29.090 --> 01:14:33.051
So they think that
we are right here.

01:14:33.135 --> 01:14:35.053
But...

01:14:35.137 --> 01:14:38.223
we went out of radio contact...

01:14:38.307 --> 01:14:42.644
and flew around that storm
for about an hour.

01:14:42.728 --> 01:14:45.605
So that's a distance
of what, 400 miles?

01:14:47.358 --> 01:14:49.275
Four hundred miles squared.

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:53.279
That's 160,000...

01:14:53.364 --> 01:14:57.033
times pi... 3.14.

01:14:59.912 --> 01:15:04.457
Five hundred and two thousand,
four...

01:15:04.542 --> 01:15:08.420
That's a search area
of 500,000 square miles.

01:15:11.007 --> 01:15:13.133
That's twice the size of Texas.

01:15:15.594 --> 01:15:17.512
They may never find us.

01:15:42.663 --> 01:15:45.415
This tooth is just killing me.

01:15:45.499 --> 01:15:48.001
It started out just hurting
when I bit down...

01:15:48.085 --> 01:15:51.713
but now it just hurts
all the time.

01:15:51.797 --> 01:15:54.466
All the time.

01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:57.218
It's-It's a good thing there's
not much to eat around here...

01:15:57.303 --> 01:15:59.471
because I don't think
I could chew it.

01:16:01.098 --> 01:16:04.851
Just keep sucking on all that coconut
and all that crab.

01:16:07.313 --> 01:16:09.230
And just think...

01:16:09.315 --> 01:16:11.775
I used to avoid
going to the dentist...

01:16:11.859 --> 01:16:15.028
like the plague.

01:16:15.112 --> 01:16:18.740
I put it off every single chance I got.
But now...

01:16:18.824 --> 01:16:22.744
oh, what I wouldn't give...

01:16:22.828 --> 01:16:25.955
to have a-a dentist
right here in this cave.

01:16:31.504 --> 01:16:33.546
In fact,
I wish you were a dentist.

01:16:39.345 --> 01:16:41.262
Yeah.

01:16:41.347 --> 01:16:43.264
Dr. Wilson.

01:16:53.651 --> 01:16:55.568
You wanna hear something funny?

01:16:57.196 --> 01:17:00.240
Back home in Memphis...

01:17:00.324 --> 01:17:04.202
my dentist's name is
Dr. James Spaulding.

01:17:24.473 --> 01:17:26.975
She's much prettier
in real life.

01:21:45.150 --> 01:21:47.110
Shut up!

01:22:52.134 --> 01:22:54.051
"Bakersfield"?

01:22:58.390 --> 01:23:01.058
Bakersfield!

01:23:57.991 --> 01:23:59.951
This could work.

01:24:01.453 --> 01:24:03.371
This could work.

01:24:37.447 --> 01:24:40.992
Twenty-two...
Forty-four lashings.

01:24:42.995 --> 01:24:44.954
Forty-four lashings. So...

01:24:47.416 --> 01:24:49.333
We have to make rope again.

01:24:53.422 --> 01:24:55.673
Wilson, we're gonna have to make
a hell of a lot of rope.

01:25:02.055 --> 01:25:04.765
Eight lashings
of these structurals.

01:25:04.850 --> 01:25:07.768
That's 24 apiece.

01:25:07.853 --> 01:25:11.272
That'll be 100... 160.

01:25:11.356 --> 01:25:13.524
Here we are today.

01:25:13.609 --> 01:25:18.237
That gives us another month and a half
until we're into March and April...

01:25:18.322 --> 01:25:21.616
which is our best chances for the
high tides and the offshore breezes.

01:25:23.243 --> 01:25:28.581
We need... We need 424 feet...

01:25:28.665 --> 01:25:32.209
of good rope, plus another 50 feet,
say, for miscellaneous.

01:25:32.294 --> 01:25:36.672
Round that off to
475 feet of good rope.

01:25:36.757 --> 01:25:40.926
Now, if we average
15 feet a day...

01:25:41.011 --> 01:25:45.306
Plus, we have to build it...

01:25:45.390 --> 01:25:49.060
we have to stock it,
we have to launch it.

01:25:51.563 --> 01:25:53.814
That's gonna be tight.

01:25:53.899 --> 01:25:55.858
That is not much time.

01:25:57.235 --> 01:25:59.153
But we...

01:25:59.237 --> 01:26:01.906
We live and we die by time,
don't we?

01:26:04.076 --> 01:26:07.995
Now, let's not commit the sin
of turning our back on time.

01:26:13.210 --> 01:26:18.589
I know.

01:26:37.943 --> 01:26:39.860
This is it.

01:26:42.364 --> 01:26:45.366
That's all that's left.

01:26:45.450 --> 01:26:48.536
I checked over the whole island,
and that is all that's left.

01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:50.579
So we're gonna be short.

01:26:53.875 --> 01:26:55.793
Short.

01:27:02.801 --> 01:27:04.885
We'll just have to make some more
out of the videotape.

01:27:06.722 --> 01:27:08.889
Yes. No, we have time.

01:27:08.974 --> 01:27:10.891
We do. We have time. Look!

01:27:10.976 --> 01:27:13.185
The wind's still blowing in
from the west.

01:27:19.818 --> 01:27:22.278
I know!

01:27:22.362 --> 01:27:25.489
Yeah, I know... I know where
there's 30 feet of extra rope!

01:27:25.574 --> 01:27:28.909
But... But I'm not
going back up there.

01:28:41.191 --> 01:28:44.235
There, there.
There, you see? Huh?

01:28:44.319 --> 01:28:46.904
There. Are you happy?

01:28:53.870 --> 01:28:57.498
Do you have to keep bringing that up?
Can't you just forget it?

01:28:57.582 --> 01:28:59.959
Huh? You were right.

01:29:01.711 --> 01:29:03.629
You were right. It was a good thing
that we did a test...

01:29:03.713 --> 01:29:07.174
'cause it wasn't gonna be
just a quick little snap.

01:29:07.259 --> 01:29:10.344
I would have landed
on the rocks.

01:29:10.428 --> 01:29:15.140
Broken my leg or my back or my neck.
Bled to death.

01:29:15.225 --> 01:29:17.935
But it was the only option I had
at the time though, okay?

01:29:18.019 --> 01:29:20.563
It was what, a year ago?

01:29:20.647 --> 01:29:22.606
So let's just forget it.

01:29:27.153 --> 01:29:29.113
And what is your point?

01:29:30.949 --> 01:29:33.492
Well...

01:29:33.577 --> 01:29:35.494
we might just make it.

01:29:35.579 --> 01:29:37.538
Did that thought
ever cross your brain?

01:29:39.291 --> 01:29:43.085
Well, regardless, I would rather
take my chance out there on the ocean...

01:29:43.169 --> 01:29:46.171
than to stay here and die
on this shithole island...

01:29:46.256 --> 01:29:51.552
spending the rest of my life talking
to a goddamn volleyball!

01:29:56.766 --> 01:29:58.684
Shut you up.

01:30:05.317 --> 01:30:09.111
Wilson! Wilson!

01:30:15.702 --> 01:30:17.953
Wilson!

01:30:19.122 --> 01:30:23.417
Wilson!

01:30:25.754 --> 01:30:28.088
Wilson.

01:30:30.091 --> 01:30:32.009
Wilson!

01:30:33.345 --> 01:30:37.806
Oh, God! Wilson!

01:30:37.891 --> 01:30:39.850
Wilson!

01:30:45.398 --> 01:30:47.316
Oh! Oh!

01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:50.611
Never again.
Never again, never again.

01:30:50.695 --> 01:30:53.864
You're okay. You okay? Yeah.

01:31:12.759 --> 01:31:14.969
Yeah, I know you.

01:31:15.053 --> 01:31:17.471
I know you. I know you.

01:31:22.394 --> 01:31:25.688
So, we okay?

01:31:27.065 --> 01:31:29.191
Okay?

01:31:31.361 --> 01:31:33.404
Okay.

01:33:10.710 --> 01:33:12.669
You still awake?

01:33:15.340 --> 01:33:17.299
Me too.

01:33:24.933 --> 01:33:26.850
You scared?

01:33:30.063 --> 01:33:32.022
Me too.

01:34:49.684 --> 01:34:52.728
Okay. Here we go, Wilson.

01:34:52.812 --> 01:34:56.023
You don't have to worry
about anything.

01:34:56.107 --> 01:34:58.275
I'll do all the paddling.

01:34:58.359 --> 01:35:00.277
You just hang on.

01:35:46.074 --> 01:35:49.493
Not yet! Hold on!

01:36:00.255 --> 01:36:03.423
Not yet! Not yet!

01:36:04.717 --> 01:36:06.760
Not yet!

01:36:10.431 --> 01:36:13.475
Stand by, Wilson!

01:36:13.559 --> 01:36:16.353
Hold on! Hold on, Wilson!

01:36:33.705 --> 01:36:36.873
I think we did it!

01:36:38.418 --> 01:36:41.128
I think we did it!

01:36:41.212 --> 01:36:43.171
Wilson!

01:36:45.425 --> 01:36:47.384
I think we did it!

01:40:19.430 --> 01:40:22.933
Oh! They're gone!

01:40:28.105 --> 01:40:30.065
I don't know why!

01:41:53.274 --> 01:41:55.191
Where's Wilson?

01:41:57.153 --> 01:42:00.030
Where's Wilson?

01:42:00.114 --> 01:42:02.032
Wilson, where are you?

01:42:03.701 --> 01:42:05.619
Wilson!

01:42:09.081 --> 01:42:13.376
Wilson!

01:42:40.571 --> 01:42:42.489
Wilson!

01:42:42.573 --> 01:42:45.033
I'm comin'!

01:42:46.827 --> 01:42:48.745
Wilson!

01:43:09.183 --> 01:43:11.267
Wilson!

01:43:11.352 --> 01:43:13.770
Wilson...

01:43:18.442 --> 01:43:21.111
Wilson!

01:43:26.867 --> 01:43:29.536
Wilson! Wilson!

01:43:41.507 --> 01:43:43.883
Wilson!

01:43:47.388 --> 01:43:49.305
Wilson!

01:43:49.390 --> 01:43:51.725
I'm sorry!

01:43:53.436 --> 01:43:55.437
I'm sorry, Wilson!

01:43:55.521 --> 01:43:58.106
Wilson, I'm sorry!

01:43:59.316 --> 01:44:01.693
I'm sorry!

01:44:01.777 --> 01:44:03.903
Wilson!

01:44:03.988 --> 01:44:06.072
I can't!

01:44:06.157 --> 01:44:08.116
Wilson!

01:44:09.493 --> 01:44:11.828
Wilson!

01:44:49.450 --> 01:44:52.076
I'm... I'm sorry.

01:44:55.039 --> 01:44:56.998
I'm sorry.

01:44:58.834 --> 01:45:01.795
I'm sorry.

01:47:02.791 --> 01:47:04.709
Kelly.

01:47:10.174 --> 01:47:12.091
Kelly.

01:47:13.510 --> 01:47:15.470
Kelly.

01:47:21.185 --> 01:47:24.270
Hello? Oh, how are you?

01:47:26.190 --> 01:47:28.149
Okay.

01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:12.318
Forty-five minutes.

01:48:12.403 --> 01:48:15.113
One Dr. Pepper.

01:48:15.197 --> 01:48:17.365
Two cups of ice.

01:48:17.449 --> 01:48:19.409
I like ice.

01:48:22.246 --> 01:48:23.997
Well, here's the drill.

01:48:24.081 --> 01:48:27.041
Um, plane pulls in,
we get off...

01:48:27.126 --> 01:48:29.919
and there's a little ceremony
right there in the hangar.

01:48:31.255 --> 01:48:33.589
Fred Smith
will say a few words.

01:48:33.674 --> 01:48:37.135
All you have to do is smile
and say "thank you."

01:48:38.595 --> 01:48:40.680
Then we'll take you over
to see Kelly.

01:48:43.267 --> 01:48:45.226
She's actually gonna
be there, huh?

01:48:46.603 --> 01:48:48.896
Well, that's what
we have arranged.

01:48:48.981 --> 01:48:50.732
I mean, if you're sure
you wanna do that.

01:48:50.816 --> 01:48:52.942
Oh, yeah, yeah. Yes.

01:48:57.114 --> 01:48:59.282
I don't know what
I'm gonna say to her.

01:49:00.826 --> 01:49:03.036
What in the world
am I gonna say to her?

01:49:07.041 --> 01:49:10.293
Chuck, Kelly had to let you go.

01:49:10.377 --> 01:49:12.545
You know?

01:49:12.629 --> 01:49:15.381
She thought you were dead.

01:49:15.466 --> 01:49:17.508
And we buried you.

01:49:19.303 --> 01:49:23.306
We had a funeral and a coffin
and a gravestone.

01:49:23.390 --> 01:49:25.349
The whole thing.

01:49:26.602 --> 01:49:28.519
You had a coffin?

01:49:31.273 --> 01:49:33.191
What was in it?

01:49:34.485 --> 01:49:37.236
Well, everybody put
something in.

01:49:37.321 --> 01:49:42.075
You know, just a cell phone
or a beeper, some pictures.

01:49:42.159 --> 01:49:44.243
I put in some Elvis CDs.

01:49:47.164 --> 01:49:49.123
So you had my funeral...

01:49:51.585 --> 01:49:54.170
and then you had
Mary's funeral.

01:49:59.009 --> 01:50:02.678
Stan, I'm so sorry
I wasn't around when Mary died.

01:50:05.099 --> 01:50:08.893
I should've been there for you,
and I wasn't.

01:50:12.272 --> 01:50:15.233
I'm so sorry.

01:50:15.317 --> 01:50:17.777
Four years ago...

01:50:17.861 --> 01:50:21.906
the FedEx family lost
five of our sons.

01:50:21.990 --> 01:50:25.076
That was a terrible
and tragic day.

01:50:26.161 --> 01:50:29.288
But today, one of those sons...

01:50:29.373 --> 01:50:33.251
Chuck Noland,
has been returned to us.

01:50:33.335 --> 01:50:35.461
Chuck, welcome home.

01:50:44.888 --> 01:50:49.142
Just moments ago,
Fred Smith welcomed home Chuck Noland.

01:50:49.226 --> 01:50:50.915
How about it, Michelle?

01:50:50.916 --> 01:50:52.603
It's such an incredible
and amazing story...

01:50:52.688 --> 01:50:54.523
to come back from the dead.

01:50:54.524 --> 01:50:56.357
Well, it's so amazing that
Smith himself welcomed him back.

01:50:56.441 --> 01:51:00.069
And Fred acknowledged that,
"While time waits for no man...

01:51:00.154 --> 01:51:03.072
we take time to pause
to honor one of our own."

01:51:03.157 --> 01:51:05.408
Now, that's an expensive pause.

01:51:13.417 --> 01:51:15.501
I'm-I'm sorry.
I must be in the wrong place.

01:51:15.586 --> 01:51:18.337
No, you're in the right place.

01:51:18.422 --> 01:51:22.758
You probably don't remember me. I actually
did root canal on you about five years ago.

01:51:22.843 --> 01:51:25.011
Jim Spaulding referred you.

01:51:26.930 --> 01:51:28.890
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:51:33.770 --> 01:51:35.730
I'm Kelly's husband.

01:51:37.357 --> 01:51:39.859
Jerry Lovett.

01:51:39.943 --> 01:51:43.029
Kelly wanted...

01:51:43.113 --> 01:51:45.031
Kelly wanted to be here...

01:51:47.618 --> 01:51:51.537
Look, this is very hard
for everyone.

01:51:51.622 --> 01:51:54.207
I can't even imagine
how hard it is for you.

01:51:59.004 --> 01:52:00.963
Kelly, uh...

01:52:03.592 --> 01:52:05.509
She's had it rough.

01:52:05.594 --> 01:52:08.262
First when she thought
she lost you...

01:52:08.347 --> 01:52:10.264
and now dealing
with all of this.

01:52:10.349 --> 01:52:13.726
It's-It's confusing.
It's very emotional for her.

01:52:13.810 --> 01:52:15.728
She's...

01:52:17.439 --> 01:52:20.942
She's... sort of lost.

01:52:23.403 --> 01:52:25.613
Maybe you could just
give her a little more time.

01:52:31.328 --> 01:52:33.537
Anyway, uh...

01:52:33.622 --> 01:52:35.539
I'm sorry that...

01:53:32.931 --> 01:53:34.849
Okay, people, let's go.

01:53:34.933 --> 01:53:37.226
Party's over. Let's go home.
Let's go home.

01:53:37.311 --> 01:53:39.854
You're definitely gonna
have to go down to the DMV.

01:53:39.938 --> 01:53:42.481
Okay, Maynard, let's go.
Chuck's had a big day.

01:53:42.566 --> 01:53:44.267
I have to brief this man
on his meetings tomorrow...

01:53:44.268 --> 01:53:44.647
I know.

01:53:44.651 --> 01:53:46.569
With the accountants
and the attorneys, all right?

01:53:46.653 --> 01:53:49.155
I will see you bright and early
in the morning.

01:53:49.239 --> 01:53:53.492
- Hey, Chuck, welcome home. We love you.
- Becca, I need to speak to you.

01:53:53.577 --> 01:53:57.204
You know, Chuck, we gotta catch up
on some of that fishin', now.

01:53:57.289 --> 01:53:59.248
Take care.

01:54:01.835 --> 01:54:04.295
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:54:07.424 --> 01:54:09.842
You got everything
you need? Okay.

01:54:09.926 --> 01:54:11.844
Well, if you need anything,
just sign for it...

01:54:11.928 --> 01:54:14.180
and I'll see you
in the morning.

01:54:14.264 --> 01:54:17.058
Get some sleep, okay?
We got another big day tomorrow.

01:54:17.142 --> 01:54:19.602
It takes a lot of paperwork
to bring back a man.

01:54:21.271 --> 01:54:24.523
- Bring you back to life, man.
- Bye, Chuck.

01:54:24.608 --> 01:54:26.859
- Take care, now.
- Tomorrow.

01:54:26.943 --> 01:54:29.153
Tomorrow we're gonna
bring you back to life.

01:56:14.009 --> 01:56:15.926
How long are you gonna be, man?

01:56:18.555 --> 01:56:21.182
Well...

01:56:21.266 --> 01:56:24.393
- how long will that buy me?
- About ten minutes.

01:56:48.585 --> 01:56:50.628
I'm awake.

01:56:50.712 --> 01:56:52.755
I saw your taxi drive up.

01:56:55.300 --> 01:56:57.259
Get in here out of the rain.

01:57:04.309 --> 01:57:06.519
I saw you
down at the hub today...

01:57:06.603 --> 01:57:08.938
so I know you were down there.

01:57:27.290 --> 01:57:29.208
Let me get you a towel.

01:57:41.137 --> 01:57:43.097
They're sleeping.

01:57:46.810 --> 01:57:49.061
If you come in,
I'll make you some coffee.

01:58:02.534 --> 01:58:04.451
It's a nice house.

01:58:04.536 --> 01:58:06.495
Yeah, we got
a nice mortgage too.

01:58:14.254 --> 01:58:16.922
What's your daughter's name?

01:58:17.007 --> 01:58:21.594
Katie.

01:58:24.931 --> 01:58:28.017
- She's a beautiful little girl.
- She's a handful.

01:58:42.324 --> 01:58:44.241
Just let me get
one thing straight here.

01:58:54.210 --> 01:58:57.463
We have a pro football team now,
but they're in Nashville?

01:59:03.011 --> 01:59:08.140
Um, yeah. Oh, my God. Okay.
They used to be in Houston.

01:59:08.224 --> 01:59:12.353
First they were the Oilers,
and now they're the Titans.

01:59:12.437 --> 01:59:15.105
The Houston Oilers
are the Tennessee Titans?

01:59:15.190 --> 01:59:17.107
Yeah.

01:59:17.192 --> 01:59:19.109
But that's not all.

01:59:19.194 --> 01:59:22.154
They went to the Super Bowl
last year.

01:59:22.238 --> 01:59:24.823
- And I missed that.
- You would've died. It was so exciting.

01:59:24.908 --> 01:59:28.452
They almost won by one yard.
One lousy yard right at the end.

01:59:30.872 --> 01:59:34.166
I got whole milk,
2% and nonfat.

01:59:34.250 --> 01:59:36.502
I don't have any half-and-half,
and that's what you like.

01:59:37.754 --> 01:59:39.713
That'll do fine.

01:59:52.769 --> 01:59:55.020
What happened to you
becoming a professor?

01:59:57.023 --> 02:00:00.818
You're not
Dr. Kelly Frears-Lovett?

02:00:03.988 --> 02:00:06.448
When you, um...

02:00:06.533 --> 02:00:09.368
When your plane went down...

02:00:09.452 --> 02:00:11.704
everything just sort of
got put on hold.

02:00:14.582 --> 02:00:17.042
I think about
taking it up again, though.

02:00:29.222 --> 02:00:31.140
I came out here
to give you this.

02:00:32.851 --> 02:00:34.810
Oh, my God.

02:00:36.855 --> 02:00:38.814
I'm sorry it doesn't work.

02:00:40.400 --> 02:00:43.152
And I, uh, I kept the picture.

02:00:44.446 --> 02:00:46.447
It was all faded anyway.

02:00:47.824 --> 02:00:50.617
I want you to have it.
I gave it to you.

02:00:50.702 --> 02:00:53.787
That's a family heirloom,
and it should stay in your family.

02:01:03.840 --> 02:01:06.633
That's everything I have
from when you went down to now.

02:01:08.845 --> 02:01:11.346
They said they never figured out
what caused the crash.

02:01:11.431 --> 02:01:15.017
Probably some mislabeled
hazardous material caught fire.

02:01:19.355 --> 02:01:21.690
So here's where
that ship found you.

02:01:23.026 --> 02:01:26.195
You drifted about 500 miles.

02:01:26.279 --> 02:01:28.489
This is where
your island was...

02:01:28.573 --> 02:01:31.909
about 600 miles
south of the Cook Islands.

02:01:33.536 --> 02:01:35.746
And these are the search grids.

02:01:35.830 --> 02:01:38.707
Ships went back and forth
for weeks looking for you.

02:01:47.759 --> 02:01:49.885
I never should've
gotten on that plane.

02:01:52.222 --> 02:01:54.723
I never should've
gotten out of the car.

02:01:58.561 --> 02:02:00.479
I wanna show you something.

02:02:02.565 --> 02:02:04.525
Come here.

02:02:14.160 --> 02:02:16.078
This is... This is our car.

02:02:18.456 --> 02:02:20.415
You kept our car.

02:02:22.585 --> 02:02:25.879
All right, now, this is weird.

02:02:34.347 --> 02:02:36.515
It's a good car.

02:02:36.599 --> 02:02:38.892
Had a lot of memories
in this car.

02:02:38.977 --> 02:02:41.603
Two very nice memories.

02:02:41.688 --> 02:02:43.772
Oh, that trip
down to the Gulf, yeah.

02:02:46.317 --> 02:02:48.235
So, can I drive it?

02:02:48.319 --> 02:02:50.279
It's your car.

02:02:57.954 --> 02:03:01.123
That's good, 'cause my...
my taxi's gone.

02:03:07.255 --> 02:03:09.590
Um...

02:03:09.674 --> 02:03:11.633
Let me get some stuff
out of the back.

02:03:34.115 --> 02:03:36.533
You think you're gonna
have more kids?

02:03:36.618 --> 02:03:38.535
I don't know.

02:03:38.620 --> 02:03:41.455
It's kind of confusing
right now.

02:03:41.539 --> 02:03:44.249
Well, you should.

02:03:44.334 --> 02:03:46.335
I mean, really, you should.

02:03:48.755 --> 02:03:50.672
I would.

02:03:52.842 --> 02:03:54.760
So, what now?

02:03:57.805 --> 02:03:59.723
I don't know.

02:04:02.226 --> 02:04:04.186
I really don't know.

02:04:16.866 --> 02:04:18.825
You said you'd be right back.

02:04:24.040 --> 02:04:25.958
I'm so sorry.

02:04:27.877 --> 02:04:29.836
Me too.

02:05:38.740 --> 02:05:40.657
Chuck!

02:05:44.537 --> 02:05:49.291
Chuck!

02:06:06.559 --> 02:06:08.477
I always knew you were alive.

02:06:08.561 --> 02:06:11.229
I knew it.

02:06:11.314 --> 02:06:13.440
But everybody said
I had to stop saying that...

02:06:13.524 --> 02:06:15.567
that I had to let you go.

02:06:16.944 --> 02:06:19.863
I love you.

02:06:19.947 --> 02:06:21.823
You're the love of my life.

02:06:24.368 --> 02:06:26.328
I love you too, Kelly.

02:06:27.914 --> 02:06:29.831
More than you'll ever know.

02:07:30.852 --> 02:07:32.769
Chuck?

02:07:39.652 --> 02:07:42.487
You have to go home.

02:08:30.786 --> 02:08:32.829
We both had done
the math, and...

02:08:35.249 --> 02:08:37.626
Kelly added it all up.

02:08:39.295 --> 02:08:41.213
She knew she had to let me go.

02:08:41.297 --> 02:08:45.675
I added it up, knew that I'd...

02:08:45.760 --> 02:08:47.677
I'd lost her.

02:08:49.555 --> 02:08:51.806
'Cause I was never gonna
get off that island.

02:08:54.810 --> 02:08:57.395
I was gonna die there...

02:08:57.480 --> 02:08:59.439
totally alone.

02:09:05.821 --> 02:09:08.698
I mean, I was gonna get sick or I was
gonna get injured or something.

02:09:12.828 --> 02:09:14.788
The only choice I had...

02:09:17.458 --> 02:09:19.751
the only thing
I could control...

02:09:21.837 --> 02:09:25.298
was when and how...

02:09:25.383 --> 02:09:27.300
and where
that was gonna happen.

02:09:27.385 --> 02:09:31.888
So... I made a rope.

02:09:34.934 --> 02:09:37.852
And I went up to the summit
to hang myself.

02:09:41.399 --> 02:09:43.525
But I had to test it, you know?

02:09:43.609 --> 02:09:46.528
Of course. You know me.

02:09:48.489 --> 02:09:50.407
And the weight of the log...

02:09:50.491 --> 02:09:53.785
snapped the limb of the tree.

02:09:53.869 --> 02:09:55.787
So I-I...

02:09:55.871 --> 02:09:58.498
I couldn't even kill myself
the way I wanted to.

02:09:58.582 --> 02:10:01.543
I had power over nothing.

02:10:10.011 --> 02:10:13.555
And that's when this feeling came over me
like a warm blanket.

02:10:17.601 --> 02:10:19.644
I knew...

02:10:19.729 --> 02:10:22.022
somehow...

02:10:22.106 --> 02:10:24.441
that I had to stay alive.

02:10:26.068 --> 02:10:27.986
Somehow.

02:10:29.071 --> 02:10:31.364
I had to keep breathing...

02:10:33.909 --> 02:10:35.994
even though there was
no reason to hope.

02:10:38.122 --> 02:10:41.833
And all my logic said that I would never
see this place again.

02:10:46.672 --> 02:10:49.507
So that's what I did.

02:10:49.592 --> 02:10:52.135
I stayed alive.

02:10:52.219 --> 02:10:54.137
I kept breathing.

02:10:56.390 --> 02:10:58.641
And then one day
that logic was proven all wrong...

02:10:58.726 --> 02:11:00.643
because the tide...

02:11:02.772 --> 02:11:05.273
came in, gave me a sail.

02:11:09.945 --> 02:11:11.905
And now, here I am.

02:11:15.242 --> 02:11:18.203
I'm back...

02:11:18.287 --> 02:11:20.789
in Memphis, talking to you.

02:11:22.917 --> 02:11:25.460
I have ice in my glass.

02:11:32.134 --> 02:11:34.511
And I've lost her
all over again.

02:11:42.311 --> 02:11:44.771
I'm so sad that
I don't have Kelly.

02:11:49.902 --> 02:11:53.321
But I'm so grateful that
she was with me on that island.

02:12:00.496 --> 02:12:02.622
And I know
what I have to do now.

02:12:05.501 --> 02:12:07.585
I gotta keep breathing.

02:12:10.214 --> 02:12:12.715
Because tomorrow,
the sun will rise.

02:12:13.968 --> 02:12:16.469
Who knows what the tide
could bring?

02:13:22.077 --> 02:13:24.037
Hello!

02:13:28.417 --> 02:13:30.376
Hello!

02:13:38.093 --> 02:13:40.261
FedEx!

02:14:47.830 --> 02:14:50.957
- You look lost.
- I do?

02:14:51.041 --> 02:14:53.334
Where are you headed?

02:14:57.006 --> 02:14:58.965
Well, I was just about
to figure that out.

02:15:00.634 --> 02:15:02.927
Well, that's 83 South.

02:15:03.012 --> 02:15:07.056
And this road here will
hook you up with I-40 East.

02:15:07.141 --> 02:15:09.392
If you turn right...

02:15:09.476 --> 02:15:13.146
that'll take you to
Amarillo, Flagstaff...

02:15:13.230 --> 02:15:15.189
California.

02:15:16.358 --> 02:15:18.276
And if you head back
that direction...

02:15:18.360 --> 02:15:21.362
you'll find a whole lotta nothin'
all the way to Canada.

02:15:23.407 --> 02:15:25.325
I got it.

02:15:25.409 --> 02:15:27.619
All right, then.

02:15:30.164 --> 02:15:32.081
Good luck, cowboy.

02:15:32.166 --> 02:15:34.000
Thank you.
