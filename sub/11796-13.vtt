( bell rings )

00:04.337 --> 00:07.407
<i>* When I wake up in the</i>
<i>morning and the alarm</i>
<i>gives out a warning</i>

00:07.440 --> 00:10.276
<i>* I don't think</i>
<i>I'll ever make it on time</i>

00:10.310 --> 00:13.213
<i>* By the time I grab my books</i>
<i>and I give myself a look</i>

00:13.246 --> 00:16.816
<i>* I'm at the corner</i>

00:16.850 --> 00:22.422
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:22.455 --> 00:25.558
<i>* If the teacher pops a test</i>
<i>I know I'm in a mess</i>

00:25.592 --> 00:28.528
<i>* And my dog ate</i>

00:28.561 --> 00:31.431

00:31.464 --> 00:35.068

00:59.426 --> 01:02.328
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell *</i>

01:10.203 --> 01:12.572
Great news! I have just
gotten tickets...

01:12.605 --> 01:14.574
thank you...
to the Dodgers-Mets playoffs.

01:14.607 --> 01:17.277
Unfortunately, Mr. Belding
doesn't consider baseball

01:17.310 --> 01:20.180
a reason for missing school.
How un-American!

01:20.213 --> 01:22.582
So I have to invent
a really good excuse.

01:22.615 --> 01:24.984
All right, guys, l got one.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.586
I'll say that my
house burned down.

01:26.619 --> 01:27.887
He'll never believe you.

01:27.921 --> 01:30.590
You still have your eyebrows!

01:30.623 --> 01:32.926
I got it.
I'll say l have measles.

01:32.959 --> 01:36.596
That's no good.
He might spot check you.

01:36.629 --> 01:39.099
Okay, this one's a sure-fire.
Can't lose.

01:39.099 --> 01:40.633
I'll say my
grandmother died.

01:40.667 --> 01:45.305
Come on, Preppie,
your grandmother died
four times last year.

01:45.338 --> 01:47.507
Died four times?

01:47.540 --> 01:51.211
It's so sad what that
poor woman's gone through.

01:51.244 --> 01:54.481
I think you should
have your head
checked for bumps.

01:54.514 --> 01:57.283
Why?
All five are here.

01:58.618 --> 02:00.353
Anyway, I've got
to think of something.

02:00.387 --> 02:04.391
I'm not going to let school
stop me from
going to the game.

02:04.424 --> 02:07.193
- Tell us all about
your mom's wedding!
- Will you give her a chance?

02:07.227 --> 02:09.229
She just got off the plane!
So how was it?

02:09.262 --> 02:12.499
It was beautiful.
I cried all
through the ceremony.

02:12.532 --> 02:16.102
Why did you cry?
Didn't you like
the guy she married?

02:16.136 --> 02:18.905
Of course, I like him.
People cry when they're happy.

02:18.938 --> 02:23.309
Screech, your parents must
have laughed
when they saw you.

02:23.343 --> 02:25.512
Who told you?

02:25.545 --> 02:27.947
Hey, Jessie, what's
your stepbrother like?

02:27.981 --> 02:30.617
I don't know. He really didn't
say much at the wedding.

02:30.650 --> 02:32.952
Kelly, you've got brothers.
Got any advice?

02:32.986 --> 02:36.089
Yeah,
don't forget to make sure
the toilet seat's down.

02:36.089 --> 02:38.124
- Oh...
- Kelly!

02:38.158 --> 02:42.228
Actually, she's right.
Girls can fall in if
they're not careful.

02:42.262 --> 02:45.398
Yeah, toilets should
come with seatbelts.

02:45.432 --> 02:48.468
And your mouth should
come with an airbag.

02:48.501 --> 02:50.937
Where is this new
stepbrother of yours anyway?

02:50.970 --> 02:52.572
He's flying in
from New York tonight.

02:52.605 --> 02:55.008
He wanted to spend
extra time with his friends.

02:55.108 --> 02:57.610
- We have to make
him feel welcome.
- Don't worry about it.

02:57.644 --> 03:00.080
I'll show him the ropes
around Bayside.

03:01.081 --> 03:03.350
- ( knock on door )
- Come in!

03:04.250 --> 03:06.086
- Hey!
- Hi!

03:06.119 --> 03:08.221
What are you guys doing here?
I'm expecting Eric.

03:08.254 --> 03:10.423
We baked cookies
for your brother.

03:10.457 --> 03:13.093
My brother.
I like it. It sounds nice.

03:13.126 --> 03:16.496
Jessie, look at all the
different kinds we baked...
chocolate praline...

03:16.529 --> 03:20.400
awesome! Peanut
butter-chocolate chip...
he's gonna love these!

03:20.433 --> 03:23.503
A gingerbread man!
I love these!

03:23.536 --> 03:25.505
These are for Eric!

03:25.538 --> 03:27.374
Oh, well...

03:27.407 --> 03:30.243
Jessie's mom:
I'm home! Jessie, we're back!

03:30.276 --> 03:33.079
He's here.
Tell Eric to come up!

03:33.079 --> 03:35.415
I wonder what
New York guys are like.

03:39.519 --> 03:42.255
- Welcome to California!
- Thanks.

03:42.288 --> 03:45.392
- I didn't know
you had sisters.
- All: Sisters?

03:45.425 --> 03:47.660
- No, these are my friends.
- Hi, I'm Kelly.

03:47.694 --> 03:49.462
- I'm Eric.
- Hi, I'm Lisa.

03:49.496 --> 03:51.131
I'm yours.

03:52.632 --> 03:54.601
- We baked you some cookies.
- Really?

03:54.634 --> 03:57.170
Yeah, try the headless
gingerbread man.

03:57.203 --> 03:59.105
Let's dump these two
and go to the beach.

03:59.105 --> 04:02.108
- We'll make nice in the sand.
- Maybe some other time.

04:02.142 --> 04:06.579
- You're hot for me,
aren't you?
- What? Jessie?

04:06.613 --> 04:10.283
I can tell by the way
that you won't
let go of my hand.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.689
- So how was your flight?
- It was great.

04:15.722 --> 04:18.190
I locked all the bathrooms
on the 747.

04:18.224 --> 04:22.495
Everybody jumped off the plane
before we
reached the terminal.

04:22.529 --> 04:24.531
Eric, you're
in California now.

04:24.564 --> 04:26.666
Just remember the ocean's
on the left. See ya!

04:26.700 --> 04:29.336
I'm out of here.

04:29.369 --> 04:31.705
- Your friend wants me.
- Oh...

04:31.738 --> 04:35.175
well, I'm glad she made you
feel so... welcome.

04:36.242 --> 04:38.478
Here's a little gift from me.

04:41.481 --> 04:43.983
No, thanks.
Gray's not my color.

04:44.084 --> 04:46.252
Yeah, you're more...
earthy tones.

04:46.286 --> 04:49.389
- Come on,
I'll show you your room.
- This room will be great

04:49.422 --> 04:52.092
once I get rid
of all this girl stuff.

04:52.092 --> 04:54.427
Wait... hold on, Eric.
This is my room.

04:54.461 --> 04:57.464
No problem, we'll share.

04:57.497 --> 05:01.301
- Mom!
- Mom!

05:01.334 --> 05:04.404
Slater, I'm telling you,
it's all set.
This plan can't miss.

05:04.437 --> 05:06.673
We'll go to the game
and get excused from school.

05:06.706 --> 05:09.642
What are you, crazy?
The Pope doesn't even know us.

05:09.676 --> 05:11.678
Why would he invite us
to the Vatican?

05:11.711 --> 05:14.047
Huh... maybe you're right.

05:14.047 --> 05:17.350
I'll think of something.

05:17.384 --> 05:19.686
I cannot believe how rude
my stepbrother acted.

05:19.719 --> 05:22.122
Rude? That was nothing.
My brother Bennett

05:22.155 --> 05:25.058
blew out his birthday cake
with a mouth
full of Diet Coke.

05:25.058 --> 05:30.330
- Yeah, but little
kids do those things.
- Little? He was 19!

05:30.363 --> 05:33.400
Hey, Jessie, I waited for you
this morning. Where were you?

05:33.433 --> 05:35.702
Well, actually,
I was drying off.

05:35.735 --> 05:39.072
I fell in the toilet.

05:39.072 --> 05:42.442
I thought you looked
a little flushed.

05:42.475 --> 05:44.611
Lisa: See you.

05:44.644 --> 05:46.579
- What's up, Jess?
- So, where's Eric?

05:46.613 --> 05:49.149
Meeting with Mr. Belding
to get his new schedule.

05:49.182 --> 05:51.551
What a way to start
a new school.

05:51.584 --> 05:54.988
Eric on PA: <i>Attention,</i>
<i>everybody. Summer</i>
<i>vacation's starting early.</i>

05:55.088 --> 05:57.424
<i>See you in September.</i>

05:57.457 --> 06:01.094
Belding over PA:
<i>Hey, get away from</i>
<i>that intercom, Eric.</i>

06:02.162 --> 06:04.431
Sounds like my kind of guy.

06:05.065 --> 06:07.233
Give me that!

06:07.734 --> 06:10.036
Hey, sis.

06:10.070 --> 06:12.572
Guys, this is my...

06:12.605 --> 06:16.109
my mother's new husband's son,
my stepbrother Eric.

06:16.142 --> 06:18.545
- Nice stunt on the PA.
- Who are you?

06:18.578 --> 06:21.715
I'm Zack Morris. When it comes
to scams, I'm top dog.

06:21.748 --> 06:25.318
- In my school,
you'd just be a puppy.
- Oh...

06:25.352 --> 06:29.356
- And who is this?
Your trainer?
- No.

06:29.389 --> 06:32.592
I'm Slater.
I go out with your sister.

06:32.625 --> 06:36.262
Oh yeah, you're the yutz
she wrote about in her diary.

06:37.364 --> 06:39.733
How dare you, Eric?
Give me that back!

06:39.766 --> 06:42.469
- "Give me that back!"
- Exactly what did
she write about me?

06:42.502 --> 06:45.372
- Five bucks a page, Curly.
- I'm warning you.

06:45.405 --> 06:49.242
- Give me that!
- ( bell rings )

06:49.275 --> 06:53.213
Did she write anything good
about me after the prom, Eric?

06:53.246 --> 06:56.616
Look, because
you're Jessie's brother,
I'll help you fit in.

06:56.649 --> 06:58.518
Let me see your schedule.

07:04.124 --> 07:06.459
All right,
you've got math with me.
It's right in there.

07:06.493 --> 07:08.661
Ooh, I'm so lucky.

07:08.695 --> 07:10.730
The first thing
you need is books.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.532
That's cool,
I talked some dork

07:12.565 --> 07:15.035
- into carrying them
from the bookstore.
- Is that right?

07:15.068 --> 07:17.237
- Hi, Zack.
- Bye, Zack.

07:19.072 --> 07:20.373
Why are you
carrying Eric's books?

07:20.407 --> 07:23.243
'Cause I was the
lucky 100th person
to come to the front door.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.111
You're so stupid!

07:25.145 --> 07:28.214
You're just jealous,
'cause you didn't win.

07:28.248 --> 07:30.183
Come on, Lisa,
how about Saturday?

07:30.216 --> 07:32.552
No, thanks.
I'm married.

07:34.521 --> 07:37.691
- How about Sunday?
- How about never?

07:41.594 --> 07:44.764
- Come on, give me a chance.
- Look, if you want a chance,

07:44.798 --> 07:47.133
buy a lottery ticket.

07:53.340 --> 07:55.809
I never thought
I'd be happy to see you.

07:55.842 --> 07:59.245
All good things come
to those who wait, my darling.

07:59.279 --> 08:01.181
I don't think so.

08:05.118 --> 08:09.489
- Hi.
- ( bell rings )

08:09.522 --> 08:13.159
- Good morning, everyone.
- Class: Good morning, Mr.
Sachs.

08:13.193 --> 08:16.062
I'd like to introduce
a new student to our class...

08:16.096 --> 08:20.033
Eric Tramer, who's joined us
all the way from New York.

08:21.634 --> 08:25.105
- I love New York.
- So why don't you go there?

08:25.138 --> 08:28.742
Okay,
everyone, let's make Eric
really feel at home here.

08:28.775 --> 08:31.111
- Let's mug him!
- ( laughter )

08:31.144 --> 08:32.379
Just kidding.

08:32.412 --> 08:34.714
Before we begin
on chapter 1 2 today,

08:34.748 --> 08:36.582
I have an announcement
to make.

08:36.616 --> 08:39.519
Tomorrow's the Jewish holiday
of Rosh Hashanah,

08:39.552 --> 08:43.789
and since I'm Jewish,
I'll be home
celebrating the new year.

08:43.823 --> 08:46.126
Well, that makes tonight
New Year's Eve.

08:46.159 --> 08:49.429
- I don't have a date!
- Those students
who are Jewish,

08:49.462 --> 08:51.731
please raise your hand
so I'll be able to tell

08:51.765 --> 08:55.101
the substitute teacher
about your absence.

08:55.135 --> 08:56.736
Oh good.

08:56.770 --> 09:00.440
Wait a minute.
The Mets-Dodgers
game is tomorrow.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.611
Since when did you
become Jewish?

09:04.644 --> 09:06.079
When my team
got into the playoffs.

09:06.112 --> 09:09.115
- Want to come?
- I can't. I'm Presbyterian.

09:09.149 --> 09:12.819
Mr. Morris.
I wish you a happy new year.

09:12.852 --> 09:14.354
<i>Shalom.</i>

09:14.387 --> 09:17.757
And a double <i>shalom</i>
to you too, sir.

09:19.526 --> 09:21.494
Let's get started.

09:24.197 --> 09:26.433
Here's the baseball game
l taped for you.

09:26.466 --> 09:28.601
- Good.
I can't wait to see it.
- ( gasps )

09:28.635 --> 09:30.303
Put it in.

09:35.108 --> 09:37.644
Why do you want to watch
a game that's been over for
three hours anyway?

09:37.677 --> 09:40.246
Because I'm a Mets fan.
I want to see who won.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.515
I watched the game
before I came over.
I can tell you who won.

09:42.549 --> 09:45.719
I can hang you upside down
out that window if you do.

09:45.752 --> 09:49.255
You New York guys
take baseball seriously.

09:49.289 --> 09:51.558
Do you think Jessie
will mind us being here?

09:51.591 --> 09:53.693
We're real close...
brother and sister.

09:53.727 --> 09:55.328
( gasps )

09:55.362 --> 09:58.398
- What are you doing in here?
- Watching the game.

09:58.431 --> 09:59.833
Get out.
I want to get dressed.

09:59.866 --> 10:01.835
It's cool, we're family.

10:01.868 --> 10:05.772
Yeah, cousin Jessie,
have some chips.

10:05.805 --> 10:09.642
If I wasn't in this towel,
I'd hang you upside
down outside that window.

10:09.676 --> 10:12.145
Jeez, you guys
think alike already.

10:16.783 --> 10:19.152
Commentator:
<i>It's the top of the fifth.</i>

10:19.185 --> 10:21.688
<i>Dodgers and Mets</i>
<i>tied one apiece.</i>

10:21.721 --> 10:24.491
<i>- Strawberry steps</i>
<i>into to face Gooden.</i>
- Oooh...

10:24.524 --> 10:26.326
Don't tell me.

10:26.359 --> 10:28.294
Commentator:
<i>Here comes the first pitch.</i>

10:28.328 --> 10:30.730
<i>He fouls it off</i>
<i>into the crowd!</i>

10:30.764 --> 10:33.366
Look, this is where Zack
catches a foul ball.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.535
What?
Where is Zack?

10:35.568 --> 10:37.237
The one with the Dodger
blue yarmulke.

10:37.270 --> 10:39.806
That's a Dodger hat
turned around, you dweeb.

10:39.839 --> 10:44.911
No, it's a yarmulke.
He pretended to be Jewish to
get out of school.

10:44.944 --> 10:48.248
I bet Zack could get
in a lot of trouble if
Belding saw this tape.

10:48.281 --> 10:50.216
It could probably
get him suspended.

10:50.250 --> 10:51.951
Really?

10:51.985 --> 10:54.888
In that case, I'll keep it so
it doesn't fall
into the wrong hands.

10:54.921 --> 10:57.657
He's lucky we're
the only ones who saw him.

10:57.691 --> 10:59.926
Wait until you see
this home run!

10:59.959 --> 11:01.561
Oops.

11:10.603 --> 11:12.572
Would you mind moving?
I have to get to my locker.

11:12.605 --> 11:15.442
- It's my locker now.
- Yours is
downstairs with the nerds'.

11:15.475 --> 11:18.078
So buy yourself some
pocket
protectors and get lost.

11:18.111 --> 11:20.580
Guess what?
Thanks to your
religious experience,

11:20.613 --> 11:24.084
- I've just
inherited your locker.
- You must be dreaming.

11:24.084 --> 11:27.220
Well, actually,
I did have this dream about
you cutting school

11:27.253 --> 11:30.256
to go to "Temple Beth
Dodger Stadium."

11:30.290 --> 11:32.225
What?

11:32.258 --> 11:36.196
Is that
the ball you caught off
"Rabbi" Strawberry's bat?

11:36.229 --> 11:37.397
How did you know I was there?

11:37.430 --> 11:40.600
I saw you attending
services on TV.

11:40.633 --> 11:44.270
- I have it on tape.
- You'd better give me that.

11:44.304 --> 11:48.208
It's the ball, the locker,
and 10 lunches in
return for my silence.

11:48.241 --> 11:50.210
- That's blackmail.
- That's right, surfer boy.

11:50.243 --> 11:52.612
Hey, how are you
getting along, Eric?

11:52.645 --> 11:55.281
- Is Zack helping you fit in?
- He is, Mr. Belding.

11:55.315 --> 11:58.585
Look at this
baseball he just gave me.
It's from yesterday's game.

11:58.618 --> 12:01.254
His dad caught a foul ball.

12:01.287 --> 12:03.757
Zack,
I am really proud of you.

12:03.790 --> 12:06.159
Sir, you're going
to be even prouder

12:06.192 --> 12:08.528
because I've decided
to give Eric my locker.

12:08.561 --> 12:11.197
You know, to make him
feel right at home.

12:11.231 --> 12:14.067
I like what I'm
seeing here, boys.

12:14.067 --> 12:17.203
People helping people...

12:17.237 --> 12:20.106
gosh, I'm getting chills!

12:21.508 --> 12:23.777
I come out of the shower
and there's Eric and Screech,

12:23.810 --> 12:26.079
sitting on my bed
watching television.

12:26.079 --> 12:28.281
Screech was on your bed?

12:28.314 --> 12:32.652
- I hope you
burned your sheets.
- Jessie, that's nothing.

12:32.686 --> 12:34.688
Brothers and sisters
go through it all the time.

12:34.721 --> 12:37.123
- You have to get used to it.
- I don't have to get used it.

12:37.157 --> 12:41.161
- He's invading my house!
- Jessie,
it's his house too now.

12:41.194 --> 12:43.530
"It's his house too now."
Thanks.

12:43.563 --> 12:47.767
Sounds like you fell
into the toilet again.

12:47.801 --> 12:50.537
- Screech: Hi, cousin Jessie.
- Jessie:
I am not your cousin!

12:50.570 --> 12:52.739
Hey, we still on
for tonight, Mama?

12:52.772 --> 12:57.410
Yes, please come
over and protect me
from my wicked stepbrother.

12:57.444 --> 13:00.814
Lisa and Jessie: Argh!

13:00.847 --> 13:04.417
Zack, I can't believe
the kid actually conned
you out of your own locker.

13:04.451 --> 13:07.387
Yeah, Zack's moved in
with the nerds.

13:07.420 --> 13:12.225
They broke out a case of
Ovaltine to welcome him to
the neighborhood!

13:12.258 --> 13:15.395
It's no big deal.
I'm just being nice
because he's Jessie's brother.

13:15.428 --> 13:17.397
Slater: Yeah, okay.

13:17.430 --> 13:20.633
And Eric's being nice by not
showing Belding the tape
of the Dodger game.

13:20.667 --> 13:22.435
How do you know
about the tape?

13:22.469 --> 13:24.604
I taped the game for him.

13:24.637 --> 13:26.106
You?

13:26.139 --> 13:28.274
You taped it?
I'm going to kill you!

13:28.308 --> 13:32.479
Zack, remember your roots.
<i>Shalom</i> means peace.

13:33.847 --> 13:36.282
You didn't need help
in algebra, Jessie.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.218
- You got this down cold.
- I know,

13:38.251 --> 13:41.554
but I wanted you to keep
that teenage
terrorist away from me.

13:41.588 --> 13:45.091
You're exaggerating.
He's a harmless kid.

13:45.125 --> 13:48.428
That's what they said
about little Freddy Krueger.

13:48.461 --> 13:51.698
All right, well,
I've got to get going, but...

13:51.731 --> 13:54.334
I'll see you tomorrow, honey.
Don't worry about it.

13:54.367 --> 13:56.436
You'll be fine.

14:08.081 --> 14:09.249
What do you think
you're doing?

14:09.282 --> 14:11.117
I'm moving in.
It's my room now.

14:11.151 --> 14:14.254
- Oh yeah, says who?
- Says this.

14:14.287 --> 14:17.257
- Listen.
- ( tape rewinds )

14:17.290 --> 14:20.126
Slater's voice:
<i>Come on,</i>
<i>baby, I'm trying to study.</i>

14:20.160 --> 14:22.762
<i>Why don't you stay</i>
<i>away from my neck?</i>

14:22.796 --> 14:24.230
Jessie's voice:
<i>I can't help it.</i>

14:24.264 --> 14:26.399
- <i>I need to be</i>
<i>close to you tonight.</i>
- ( recording stops )

14:26.433 --> 14:29.769
- As you know, it gets better.
- Give me that tape!

14:30.670 --> 14:32.405
Sure. The tape for the room.

14:32.439 --> 14:35.308
- That's blackmail!
- Bingo! That's my specialty.

14:35.342 --> 14:39.846
The room,
or I play this on the PA
tomorrow morning at school.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.449
Okay,
I'll sleep in the other room,
but just for tonight.

14:42.482 --> 14:44.884
Tomorrow, you're gonna
be in deep trouble.

14:44.918 --> 14:47.787
All right,
now give me that tape!

14:47.821 --> 14:50.390
Okay, you can have the tape.

14:53.893 --> 14:57.330
Your little tricks might work
in New York,
but they don't work here.

14:57.364 --> 14:59.866
That's what you think.
I've got 20
copies of that tape.

14:59.899 --> 15:02.769
If you mess with me,
they'll be all over school.

15:02.802 --> 15:06.272
You would
embarrass your own sister
in front of the whole school?

15:06.306 --> 15:07.841
In a second.
Now look, Slater,

15:07.874 --> 15:10.243
I'm working on a big date
this weekend,

15:10.276 --> 15:13.113
- and I hear you
have a pretty hot car.
- Yeah, so?

15:13.146 --> 15:16.549
So, you lend me your car,
I'll give you the tapes.

15:17.751 --> 15:20.687
- Did you set him straight?
- Well...

15:20.720 --> 15:22.689
Car for tapes.

15:22.722 --> 15:25.158
Yeah, Mama,
I got it covered.

15:25.191 --> 15:28.395
Look, here's the tape.

15:28.428 --> 15:31.131
Well, I hope
you learned your lesson.

15:31.164 --> 15:33.099
Oh I did.
Didn't l, Slater?

15:33.133 --> 15:34.801
Oh yeah, right.
Sure.

15:34.834 --> 15:36.403
You bet.

15:38.338 --> 15:39.739
Do me a favor, Slater.

15:39.773 --> 15:42.742
Wash and gas the car
before Saturday night.

15:46.713 --> 15:49.182
Let me guess.
You're either killing a fly,

15:49.215 --> 15:51.918
or Jessie's
harmless little brother
is making a fool of you.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.387
I'm going to
kill that kid, Zack.

15:54.421 --> 15:56.890
Can you believe he wants me
to lend him my car?

15:56.923 --> 15:58.758
What's wrong with you guys?

15:58.792 --> 16:00.760
You're not even giving
this guy a chance.

16:00.794 --> 16:03.229
He's new at school,
he has no friends,

16:03.263 --> 16:05.732
he's in love with Lisa
and she won't
even talk to him.

16:05.765 --> 16:09.602
I'm ashamed of you.
( scoffs )

16:09.636 --> 16:12.305
Slater, you are just the man
I've been looking for.

16:12.339 --> 16:14.474
I am?
Should I be nervous?

16:14.507 --> 16:17.577
No, I want to show you
guys what I bought Mrs.
Belding for her birthday.

16:17.610 --> 16:20.447
- Now is not
a really good time.
- No.

16:20.480 --> 16:23.717
Come with me,
I've got to show you.
You're going to love this!

16:24.918 --> 16:27.120
Belding:
Wait till you guys see this.

16:27.153 --> 16:30.890
- Isn't it great?
Isn't it hot?
- Isn't it expensive?

16:30.924 --> 16:33.226
Yeah, but you should have
seen me with the salesman.

16:33.259 --> 16:35.362
I talked him out
of a free key chain.

16:35.395 --> 16:37.130
You drive a hard bargain, sir.

16:37.163 --> 16:39.733
It would have been better
if I spoke Japanese.

16:39.766 --> 16:42.669
- That's great. <i>Sayonara</i>, sir.
- No, wait a minute, Slater.

16:42.702 --> 16:46.206
I bought a new CD player
to go along with the surprise,

16:46.239 --> 16:48.641
and I want to hire you
to install it.

16:48.675 --> 16:52.245
I'm sorry, Mr. Belding,
but I don't have time to do
that today, sir.

16:52.278 --> 16:54.681
There's no hurry.
I'll be away all weekend,

16:54.714 --> 16:56.816
and Mrs. Belding's birthday
is not till next week.

16:56.850 --> 16:58.585
- Mr. B...
- Time out.

16:58.618 --> 17:01.888
Mr. Belding wants to leave us
his car for the weekend?

17:01.921 --> 17:04.723
We'll take Eric for a ride
in more ways than one.

17:04.758 --> 17:08.194
Time in.
Sir, Slater will be glad
to put in the CD for you.

17:08.228 --> 17:10.663
- Great!
- What are you talking about?

17:14.134 --> 17:18.171
Lisa, we've been friends
for a long time.

17:18.204 --> 17:22.041
I am not a piece of toast,
so why are you
buttering me up?

17:22.041 --> 17:24.243
How would you like
front-row tickets

17:24.277 --> 17:27.579
- to the MC Hammer concert?
- You've got MC
Hammer tickets?

17:27.614 --> 17:29.582
- I'd do anything for those!
- Anything?

17:29.616 --> 17:32.585
- Anything.
Who do you want me to kill?
- No one. I want you

17:32.619 --> 17:36.056
to go out with Jessie's
lonely, misunderstood
charming brother Eric.

17:36.056 --> 17:39.292
I'd rather shave my head
and wear polyester.

17:39.325 --> 17:42.095
Look, just one date
this weekend,

17:42.128 --> 17:45.765
and the MC Hammer
tickets are yours.

17:45.799 --> 17:48.601
Huh? Huh?

17:48.635 --> 17:51.104
Why is this
so important to you?

17:51.137 --> 17:53.506
Eric is blackmailing me
because I cut school

17:53.540 --> 17:56.376
on a Jewish holiday
to go to the Dodger game.

17:56.409 --> 17:59.245
Zack, you are
<i>meshugina.</i>

17:59.279 --> 18:01.348
Please, if he asks you out,
just say yes.

18:02.716 --> 18:05.352
- Do I have to?
- No.

18:05.385 --> 18:08.254
But if you don't...
"can't touch" these.

18:09.756 --> 18:12.125
All right, bring on the worm
from the Big Apple.

18:12.158 --> 18:14.260
Zack: All right!

18:14.294 --> 18:17.063
I have had it with Eric.
He's driving me crazy!

18:17.097 --> 18:19.733
He took my TV,
my blow-dryer and my room!

18:19.766 --> 18:22.235
- I am in crisis.
- Lisa.

18:22.268 --> 18:25.171
How about going to the movies
with me tomorrow night?

18:25.205 --> 18:27.207
- Leave my friend alone.
- I'd love to go with you.

18:27.240 --> 18:30.043
She said she doesn't want
to go out with you,
so get lost!

18:30.043 --> 18:31.511
- Pick me up at 7:00?
- Great.

18:31.544 --> 18:35.081
So find someone else!

18:35.115 --> 18:37.217
Jessie, let's go
to the Lost and Found.

18:37.250 --> 18:39.719
- Why?
- Because you've lost it.

18:43.390 --> 18:46.126
- Hot car, Slater.
- I know.

18:46.159 --> 18:48.194
Look, here are the keys.

18:48.228 --> 18:51.064
Don't forget to meet me here
at no later than 11 :00.

18:51.097 --> 18:53.133
Why can't I bring the car
back to your house?

18:53.166 --> 18:55.268
His father will kill him
if he sees you driving it.

18:55.301 --> 18:57.671
- That's cool.
- After he kills me,
he'll kill you.

18:57.704 --> 19:00.674
- Bummer.
- Eric better enjoy his ride,

19:00.707 --> 19:03.543
because he's about
to become history.

19:06.346 --> 19:08.682
Have a good time.

19:08.715 --> 19:11.751
Oh, and don't forget
to buckle up.

19:12.552 --> 19:14.454
( engine starts )

19:17.323 --> 19:21.227
It was really romantic.
I've never seen
"Casablanca" before.

19:21.261 --> 19:24.364
- It was great.
- I go to classic
movies all the time.

19:24.397 --> 19:26.700
They're much better
than the ones today.

19:26.733 --> 19:29.769
Hey, do the thing where
Bogart's walking down
the runway into the fog.

19:29.803 --> 19:33.606
"Louie,
this could be the beginning
of a beautiful friendship."

19:33.640 --> 19:35.742
- That's it!
- There was a line

19:35.775 --> 19:38.511
- they cut out after that.
- Really? What was it?

19:38.545 --> 19:41.581
"Louie, I want you to wear
my class ring."

19:44.117 --> 19:46.319
( laughs )
Okay.

19:48.822 --> 19:51.324
You know, you're...

19:51.358 --> 19:53.393
you're different
than what I thought.

19:53.426 --> 19:56.629
- What did you think?
- After the way
you came on to me,

19:56.663 --> 20:00.567
I called "America's Most
Wanted" and gave them
your description.

20:00.600 --> 20:04.170
You know, you made me nervous.
I never met anyone like you.

20:04.204 --> 20:07.607
I thought I had to come on
strong, impress you.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.843
You didn't impress me.

20:09.876 --> 20:14.347
Even Screech was
looking better than you.

20:14.381 --> 20:17.150
I don't know why you decided
to go out with me tonight,

20:17.183 --> 20:21.287
but thanks.
Tonight's the first night
I haven't missed New York.

20:24.324 --> 20:27.727
Well,
the reason isn't important.

20:27.761 --> 20:30.630
- I've had a good time.
- You make me feel good.

20:30.663 --> 20:32.465
You're easy to talk to.

20:32.499 --> 20:35.201
That's nice, Eric.

20:35.235 --> 20:37.437
Screech:
Zack,
why do I have to do this?

20:37.470 --> 20:38.905
Zack:
'Cause it's your camera.

20:38.938 --> 20:41.808
Slater:
Besides,
we're bigger than you.

20:45.512 --> 20:46.880
I don't want
to hide in the bushes.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.748
There's a gopher trying
to burrow into my underwear.

20:48.782 --> 20:50.684
What?

20:50.717 --> 20:53.319
Would you just be quiet?
This is important.

20:53.353 --> 20:56.423
- I don't like this.
- We'll be hiding
right over there.

20:56.456 --> 21:00.894
All you have to do is get
a picture of Eric driving
Mrs. Belding's new car.

21:00.927 --> 21:03.329
Eric will be happy to trade
the pictures for the tapes.

21:03.363 --> 21:06.366
Right. Do you have the film?
You have the batteries?

21:06.399 --> 21:09.536
What do you take me for?
Some kind of idiot?

21:13.340 --> 21:15.742
Are you sure your friend
doesn't mind me
driving his car?

21:15.775 --> 21:20.146
Relax. Don't worry. What could
happen in an empty parking lot?

21:20.180 --> 21:22.682
Except for me
kissing you goodnight.

21:22.716 --> 21:25.251
That wouldn't be so bad.

21:30.523 --> 21:32.359
Now, Screech, now!

21:32.392 --> 21:35.562
- ( Lisa screams )
- ( bangs, glass shatters )

21:35.595 --> 21:38.498
Oops, we're in big trouble.
