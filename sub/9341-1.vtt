00:45.869 --> 00:49.186
<i>Some people hear their own inner voices...</i>

00:49.261 --> 00:50.920
<i>with great clearness...</i>

00:50.989 --> 00:54.087
<i>and they live by what they hear.</i>

00:54.157 --> 00:57.125
<i>Such people become crazy...</i>

00:57.198 --> 00:59.369
<i>or they become legends.</i>

01:06.542 --> 01:11.015
<i>Tristan Ludlow was born
in the Moon of the Falling Leaves.</i>

01:11.086 --> 01:13.508
<i>It was a terrible winter.</i>

01:13.582 --> 01:18.371
<i>His mother almost died
bringing him into this world.</i>

01:22.095 --> 01:25.772
<i>His father, the Colonel,
brought him to me.</i>

01:25.839 --> 01:30.792
<i>I wrapped him in a bear skin
and held him all that night.</i>

01:33.199 --> 01:35.054
<i>As he grew into a man...</i>

01:35.119 --> 01:38.414
<i>I taught him the great joy of the kill...</i>

01:38.480 --> 01:41.130
<i>when the hunter cuts out its warm heart</i>

01:41.199 --> 01:44.069
<i>and hold sit in his hands...</i>

01:44.143 --> 01:46.990
<i>setting its spirit free.</i>

01:48.976 --> 01:51.365
<i>Colonel Ludlow had three sons...</i>

01:51.440 --> 01:54.855
<i>but Tristan was his favorite.</i>

01:54.928 --> 01:56.870
<i>I had had sons too.</i>

01:58.672 --> 02:00.527
<i>But they were gone now...</i>

02:00.592 --> 02:01.966
<i>forever.</i>

02:03.248 --> 02:06.248
<i>It was a very bad time.</i>

02:06.321 --> 02:09.550
<i>The Colonel had tried to help the People...</i>

02:11.761 --> 02:15.022
<i>but it was no use.</i>

02:15.089 --> 02:18.602
<i>So he decided to go his own way.</i>

02:20.945 --> 02:24.938
<i>He wanted to lose the madness
over the mountains, he said...</i>

02:25.009 --> 02:27.017
<i>and begin again.</i>

02:34.802 --> 02:37.169
<i>"Lose the madness", he said.</i>

02:37.234 --> 02:39.917
<i>And so we lived for many years...</i>

02:39.986 --> 02:42.091
<i>and the boys grew strong.</i>

02:51.154 --> 02:54.253
<i>Alfred was the older brother...</i>

02:54.323 --> 02:56.265
<i>old even for his years.</i>

02:57.778 --> 03:00.626
<i>Samuel was the youngest.</i>

03:00.690 --> 03:03.887
<i>There was nothing these brothers
would not do for him.</i>

03:03.955 --> 03:06.289
<i>They watched over him like a treasure.</i>

03:07.987 --> 03:09.361
<i>One year--</i>

03:09.427 --> 03:12.941
<i>I am an old man
and cannot remember the year.</i>

03:13.012 --> 03:15.881
<i>But it was the Moon of the Red Grass...</i>

03:15.955 --> 03:18.541
<i>when Isabel Ludlow, their mother...</i>

03:18.612 --> 03:20.684
<i>went away for the winter.</i>

03:20.755 --> 03:24.552
<i>She said the winters
were too cruel for her.</i>

03:24.628 --> 03:27.345
<i>She said she was afraid of the bears.</i>

03:28.500 --> 03:30.671
<i>She was a strange woman anyway.</i>

03:44.404 --> 03:47.633
<i>That spring, though,
she did not return.</i>

03:49.173 --> 03:53.548
<i>And, after that,
she did not come much to see us.</i>

03:54.741 --> 03:57.589
<i>Alfred wrote her many letters...</i>

03:57.653 --> 04:00.948
<i>but Tristan refused to speak of her.</i>

04:01.014 --> 04:04.210
<i>His world was here with me.</i>

04:07.062 --> 04:11.404
<i>Every warrior hopes a good death
will find him...</i>

04:11.478 --> 04:13.420
<i>but Tristan couldn't wait.</i>

04:14.613 --> 04:16.620
<i>He went looking for his.</i>

05:32.409 --> 05:34.417
Tristan!

05:34.490 --> 05:35.864
Here.

05:39.257 --> 05:41.457
- Was it a bear?
- Yes, sir.

05:41.529 --> 05:42.958
- Can you breathe?
- Yes.

05:43.034 --> 05:45.042
Move your hand.
Take it away.

05:48.090 --> 05:50.578
You're a stupid, half-brained jackass.

05:50.650 --> 05:53.106
- Yes, sir.
- One Stab put you up to this?

05:55.226 --> 05:56.917
You deserve to be dead.

05:56.986 --> 05:58.993
God knows how you've lived so long.

05:59.066 --> 06:00.921
It'll be all right, son.

06:19.452 --> 06:21.907
<i>I have these letters...</i>

06:21.980 --> 06:24.849
<i>many letters.</i>

06:24.924 --> 06:27.226
<i>Read them.</i>

06:27.292 --> 06:29.147
<i>They are from all of them.</i>

06:30.076 --> 06:31.832
<i>Ludlow...</i>

06:31.899 --> 06:33.558
<i>Isabel...</i>

06:33.628 --> 06:35.416
<i>Samuel...</i>

06:35.485 --> 06:37.078
<i>the whole family...</i>

06:37.149 --> 06:39.799
<i>the whole story.</i>

06:39.869 --> 06:42.836
<i>It is all written here.</i>

06:44.061 --> 06:47.061
<i>April 13, 1913.</i>

06:47.133 --> 06:48.856
<i>Dear Isabel:</i>

06:48.925 --> 06:52.722
<i>I am not fool enough to try to reorder 
a life already lived...</i>

06:52.797 --> 06:57.052
<i>but I fear I have not done well 
raising our sons alone in this wild place.</i>

06:58.557 --> 07:00.445
<i>What did I know of children?</i>

07:00.509 --> 07:02.997
<i>I was trained to lead men.</i>

07:03.070 --> 07:05.208
<i>This is infinitely harder.</i>

07:06.238 --> 07:07.612
<i>Dear William:</i>

07:07.677 --> 07:11.255
<i>You take too much responsibility
on yourself, as always.</i>

07:11.325 --> 07:13.846
<i>Our sons are finding their own paths.</i>

07:13.918 --> 07:17.049
<i>They are willful, certainly,
but then...</i>

07:17.118 --> 07:20.152
<i>who are you and I
to complain of willfulness?</i>

07:20.222 --> 07:22.556
<i>As for Samuel, I have big news.</i>

07:22.623 --> 07:24.477
<i>At a Harvard tea for Amy Lowell...</i>

07:24.543 --> 07:28.285
<i>he met and instantly loved
Miss Susannah Finncannon.</i>

07:28.350 --> 07:31.034
<i>I know it will surprise you greatly...</i>

07:31.103 --> 07:33.754
<i>but they are engaged.</i>

07:33.823 --> 07:37.336
<i>He will bring her to Montana this summer 
to meet his brothers...</i>

07:37.407 --> 07:38.781
<i>and you.</i>

07:38.847 --> 07:41.498
<i>So, William, please behave yourself...</i>

07:41.567 --> 07:45.430
<i>and be as charming as only you can be.</i>

07:48.544 --> 07:49.918
There he is.

07:53.759 --> 07:56.214
- How the hell are you?
- Good. And you?

07:58.944 --> 08:01.366
- Samuel. Good to see you, boy.
- Father, how are you?

08:01.440 --> 08:02.869
- Good to see you.
- Hello.

08:07.840 --> 08:10.230
This is my fiancee, Susannah.

08:10.304 --> 08:12.508
- Hello.
- Miss Finncannon.

08:14.561 --> 08:16.797
- Nice to meet you.
- It's an honor.

08:18.272 --> 08:20.345
- This is Alfred.
- How do you do?

08:22.849 --> 08:25.184
- Here's your dog, miss.
- Thank you.

08:25.249 --> 08:27.966
- It's a horse.
- That's a strange-looking animal.

08:28.033 --> 08:30.903
This is Finn.
He's a champion.

08:30.977 --> 08:33.945
You like exotic-looking dogs then,
Miss Finncannon?

08:34.018 --> 08:35.806
Very much, Mr. Ludlow.

08:37.025 --> 08:39.644
- Please call me Susannah.
- All right.

08:39.714 --> 08:42.102
- He's just plain old Alfred.
- Shut up.

08:43.010 --> 08:47.288
- Where's Tristan?
- He's off somewhere. You know him.

08:47.362 --> 08:50.711
He'll welcome you home tonight
or I'll know the reason why.

08:52.482 --> 08:55.068
Miss Finncannon, please.
Did you have a good journey?

09:00.547 --> 09:03.198
<i>She is such a lovely creature.</i>

09:03.267 --> 09:05.122
<i>But I fear the loss of her parents...</i>

09:05.187 --> 09:08.799
<i>has given her a certain fragility.</i>

09:08.867 --> 09:11.682
<i>I think she feels very alone in the world.</i>

09:12.803 --> 09:16.000
<i>But she has found a new family now,
hasn't she?</i>

09:16.067 --> 09:18.849
The German military is ready
to use chaos in Croatia...

09:18.915 --> 09:22.876
to justify actions that could plunge
the entire civilized world into--

09:22.947 --> 09:26.690
The word "civilized" has no place
in discussing the affairs of this world.

09:28.388 --> 09:31.683
Mother told us of your sympathy
for the social reformers.

09:32.964 --> 09:35.419
You make it sound like a disease.

09:35.492 --> 09:37.118
No, I'm in agreement.

09:37.188 --> 09:40.603
You mother told me all about One Stab.
She says he was a great warrior.

09:40.676 --> 09:42.050
Yes.

09:42.116 --> 09:44.505
He has a bag of scalps to prove it.

09:45.636 --> 09:47.611
But don't worry.

09:47.685 --> 09:49.540
He's devoted to Father now.

09:49.605 --> 09:51.263
Rather, they're devoted to each other.

09:51.333 --> 09:52.959
Can he speak English?

09:53.029 --> 09:55.363
Stab, speak English?

09:55.428 --> 09:58.724
He wouldn't lower himself to speak English.

10:00.101 --> 10:03.397
But watch out because
he understands it perfectly well.

10:05.157 --> 10:07.012
There's Tristan.

10:26.087 --> 10:28.192
- Don't they feed you?
- Not much.

10:34.598 --> 10:37.632
- You smell.
- Miss me, did you?

10:37.703 --> 10:39.558
- Still hung over?
- Still drunk.

10:43.719 --> 10:46.086
Isn't she amazing?

10:46.151 --> 10:47.940
So this is Tristan.

10:51.079 --> 10:52.989
And does he speak English?

10:55.111 --> 10:56.518
For God's sake.

11:08.072 --> 11:11.869
Miss Finncannon,
it's a pleasure to meet you.

11:11.944 --> 11:14.595
I hope you and Ugly here...

11:14.664 --> 11:16.388
find every happiness together.

11:20.905 --> 11:25.095
Don't mind my brother. 
Your dog has more breeding than he has.

11:47.594 --> 11:49.798
This is Mother's room.

11:49.866 --> 11:51.241
It's lovely.

11:54.794 --> 11:56.899
- It's a pleasure to meet you, Pet.
- And you, miss.

11:56.970 --> 11:58.345
Thank you.

12:07.275 --> 12:09.925
- Which one?
- It's this one.

12:14.699 --> 12:16.554
Angelica Susannah.

12:47.021 --> 12:49.192
Hello.

12:50.156 --> 12:51.814
You must be Isabel Two.

12:55.373 --> 12:57.544
I've already met your mother and father.

12:59.213 --> 13:00.904
- How old are you?
- Thirteen.

13:04.941 --> 13:07.941
When I was 13, I was sent away...

13:08.013 --> 13:09.923
to boarding school.

13:10.893 --> 13:12.235
I hated it.

13:14.382 --> 13:15.592
May I help you?

13:19.438 --> 13:20.867
You're marrying Samuel.

13:20.942 --> 13:22.502
That's right, I am.

13:22.574 --> 13:24.462
I'm marrying Tristan.

13:27.343 --> 13:28.717
We'll be sisters.

13:30.671 --> 13:33.388
I see you two have met.

13:33.455 --> 13:35.113
Isabel Two is letting me help.

13:36.559 --> 13:38.926
Would you like a rest?
You must be exhausted.

13:38.991 --> 13:41.358
No, not at all.
This is so refreshing...

13:41.423 --> 13:45.198
all this grandeur, this unexpected...

13:45.263 --> 13:47.435
gift from God.

13:47.504 --> 13:51.628
It doesn't seem like much of a gift
in a hard winter, I assure you.

13:52.496 --> 13:54.022
Where's Samuel?

13:54.095 --> 13:57.259
Inside. I could tell your father
wanted him all to himself.

13:58.448 --> 14:02.060
- You're very generous.
- No, just happy.

14:05.999 --> 14:08.007
Stop mooning over her and come in here.

14:08.080 --> 14:11.625
Samuel wants to know
about the calves from Cheyenne.

14:11.696 --> 14:13.103
Get in here.

14:14.672 --> 14:17.128
Please excuse my father.

14:17.201 --> 14:21.838
It makes him feel young and powerful
to treat us like we're idiot children.

14:27.537 --> 14:31.149
For all His countless blessings,
may God's holy name be praised. Amen.

14:34.225 --> 14:37.455
Tell Father what you were saying about Vienna.

14:37.522 --> 14:39.594
- What's that?
- It's the Kaiser.

14:40.785 --> 14:43.207
He won't stop them from annihilating Serbia.

14:43.282 --> 14:45.224
Let's not talk about war, please.

14:46.162 --> 14:49.293
Susannah hears that England's mobilizing.

14:49.362 --> 14:51.947
We're stuck out here
while all this is going on.

14:52.018 --> 14:55.597
- Thank God.
- You wouldn't want us to evade a duty.

14:55.667 --> 14:58.514
- Wouldn't I?
- Father, with respect--

15:00.211 --> 15:01.836
Please excuse me for being late.

15:01.906 --> 15:04.809
I packed so carefully,
I couldn't find anything.

15:06.546 --> 15:08.816
Thank you.

15:15.027 --> 15:18.191
Would you like some--

15:24.564 --> 15:27.913
<i>As evening fell a maiden stood</i>

15:27.988 --> 15:31.403
<i>At the edge of a wood</i>

15:31.476 --> 15:34.705
<i>In her hands lay the reins</i>

15:34.772 --> 15:37.871
<i>Of a stallion</i>

15:37.940 --> 15:39.467
<i>And n'er I'd seen</i>

15:39.540 --> 15:41.362
<i>A girl as fair</i>

15:41.428 --> 15:44.527
<i>Heard a gentler voice any where</i>

15:44.596 --> 15:46.254
<i>Whispered, alas</i>

15:46.324 --> 15:47.819
<i>She belonged</i>

15:47.892 --> 15:50.348
<i>Belonged to another</i>

15:50.421 --> 15:53.770
<i>Another, forever</i>

15:54.677 --> 15:56.881
<i>Yes, she belonged to</i>

15:56.949 --> 16:00.178
<i>The twilight and mist</i>

16:02.997 --> 16:04.939
<i>Dear Isabel:</i>

16:05.013 --> 16:08.723
<i>How strange to have a cultivated woman
in the house again...</i>

16:08.789 --> 16:10.862
<i>and how intoxicating.</i>

16:10.934 --> 16:14.250
<i>To have all three of my sons
under my roof again...</i>

16:14.326 --> 16:17.522
<i>fills me with such a deep,
quiet satisfaction...</i>

16:17.590 --> 16:19.761
<i>that I thank God.</i>

17:09.656 --> 17:11.511
There's a friend of yours.

17:21.017 --> 17:22.871
A dollar says he brings her back.

18:06.491 --> 18:09.174
Whoa.

18:11.227 --> 18:13.266
Easy.

18:32.860 --> 18:35.129
You got it.

18:47.741 --> 18:49.050
Nice work.

18:50.332 --> 18:52.340
You all look like ice cream cones.

18:54.941 --> 18:56.435
I know you would have.

18:56.509 --> 18:59.258
Ready. Here we go.

19:08.637 --> 19:11.223
Go easy on him, Susannah.

19:11.293 --> 19:13.016
Alfred, you take over.

19:13.085 --> 19:14.612
I must talk to Tristan.

19:14.685 --> 19:16.987
You've disgraced the Colonel's name.

19:18.494 --> 19:21.810
- Nice shiner.
- I hit her back.

19:29.438 --> 19:30.812
She's got me spinning.

19:30.878 --> 19:32.471
I'll bet.

19:32.542 --> 19:36.252
She's got these ideas and theories, 
and she's so--

19:38.846 --> 19:40.669
What?

19:40.735 --> 19:44.379
Nothing.
How'd you break the mare?

19:45.919 --> 19:47.293
She's what?

19:49.951 --> 19:52.504
She's sort of passionate.

19:52.575 --> 19:54.647
- She a virgin?
- Good Lord, Tristan.

19:54.719 --> 19:56.694
- You brought it up.
- Of course she is.

19:56.768 --> 19:58.328
Are you?

20:02.591 --> 20:05.755
- Yes, I am.
- Going to wait till you're married?

20:06.975 --> 20:08.830
See, she says--

20:09.856 --> 20:11.798
Susannah thinks that--

20:14.592 --> 20:16.021
We won't wait.

20:16.096 --> 20:19.926
And you're afraid
you won't meet her expectations?

20:21.057 --> 20:22.715
I guess I am.

20:22.785 --> 20:26.429
Sort of. I don't know.
Should I be?

20:26.497 --> 20:28.602
Samuel, God bless you.

20:28.673 --> 20:31.455
You are good at everything you try.

20:31.521 --> 20:33.147
I'm sure it will be the same with fucking.

20:33.217 --> 20:35.006
Tristan, really.

20:35.073 --> 20:37.790
- She's my future wife.
- You're not going to fuck her?

20:40.257 --> 20:43.160
I'm planning to be with her.

20:43.234 --> 20:44.859
I recommend fucking.

20:44.929 --> 20:47.929
- You're impossible.
- You brought it up.

20:56.546 --> 20:57.920
My point!

21:21.571 --> 21:22.945
Good morning, Colonel Ludlow.

21:23.011 --> 21:25.499
Tristan's hunting.
He didn't do it.

21:25.571 --> 21:28.124
You don't have to worry about Tristan.

21:28.195 --> 21:31.872
Meet John T. and James O'Banion.
They own the mercantile store.

21:31.940 --> 21:36.250
- Morning, James, John T., Sheriff.
- Morning, Alfred.

21:36.324 --> 21:40.830
We're looking for a man we heard 
might be in this part of the country.

21:40.900 --> 21:43.551
Name is Tom Cullen.
Here's a likeness.

21:46.852 --> 21:48.227
What did he do?

21:48.292 --> 21:49.819
Do you recognize him?

21:51.653 --> 21:54.108
- Yeah, I recognize him.
- We got him.

21:54.181 --> 21:56.188
This fellow passed by here...

21:56.261 --> 21:58.268
maybe four or five years ago.

21:58.340 --> 22:02.017
Did some work here
on his way to San Francisco.

22:02.085 --> 22:04.157
He hoped to book passage to Australia.

22:05.957 --> 22:07.648
Or Hong Kong.
I can't remember.

22:07.717 --> 22:10.052
- Can you remember?
- Hong Kong.

22:14.502 --> 22:17.055
- What is he wanted for?
- He--

22:17.126 --> 22:19.133
That would be of a private nature.

22:19.206 --> 22:22.719
"Private nature"?
You hold a public office, Sheriff.

22:24.934 --> 22:26.428
Gentlemen.

22:38.183 --> 22:40.572
"There came a low hiss, a horrid sound...

22:40.646 --> 22:43.265
that made Rikki Tikki Tavi
jump back two clear feet.

22:43.335 --> 22:45.190
And then out of the grass...

22:45.255 --> 22:48.070
rose up the head and spread hood of Nag...

22:48.135 --> 22:50.044
the big black cobra."

22:50.119 --> 22:51.646
I can read another story.

22:51.719 --> 22:54.501
The Germans broke through at Armentieres.

22:54.567 --> 22:57.983
The British are trapped
in the Belgian low lands.

22:58.056 --> 23:00.838
- This paper is a week old!
- Calm down.

23:00.903 --> 23:02.791
With my fluent German,
I could become an officer.

23:02.856 --> 23:05.344
And lead other boys to the slaughter
and be slaughtered yourself.

23:05.416 --> 23:07.390
The men who served under you worshipped you.

23:07.463 --> 23:09.154
They were all damn fools.

23:09.224 --> 23:11.461
This is a turning point in history.

23:11.528 --> 23:12.902
- How can we--
- What?

23:12.968 --> 23:14.757
How can we not be part of this?

23:14.824 --> 23:17.508
- You taught us--
- To think for yourselves.

23:17.576 --> 23:20.259
- And to defend what's ours.
- Yes, what is ours!

23:20.328 --> 23:22.695
We've already lost two cousins.

23:22.761 --> 23:26.110
Don't talk at me as though
I've never seen a war!

23:29.800 --> 23:31.175
Not a war like this.

23:31.241 --> 23:35.649
They said that about the war of secession 
and the Indian wars.

23:35.721 --> 23:38.787
They say it to sell newspapers.

23:38.857 --> 23:41.988
These are not the Indian wars.
We're fighting against naked aggression!

23:42.057 --> 23:44.676
There will be no more talk of wars
in this house! Damn it!

23:47.818 --> 23:49.192
I'm sorry, Susannah.

23:52.810 --> 23:54.665
I'm going to Canada to enlist.

23:59.659 --> 24:01.568
I'm going with him.

24:12.939 --> 24:14.466
I'm sorry, my love.

24:14.539 --> 24:16.481
I meant to tell you tonight.

24:16.555 --> 24:19.751
I know you'll understand.
It's the only honorable thing to do.

24:31.307 --> 24:32.682
What's that?

24:32.748 --> 24:35.082
It's a book my father wrote...

24:36.812 --> 24:40.609
to try to convince the government
to alter their policies...

24:40.684 --> 24:42.823
towards the Indians in the Dakotas.

24:45.996 --> 24:48.101
Samuel won't change his mind.

24:48.172 --> 24:49.546
Change it for him.

24:58.605 --> 25:00.460
What happened between them?

25:02.221 --> 25:04.075
Father says she never liked it here.

25:06.125 --> 25:09.573
I think they loved mostly 
the idea of each other.

25:20.302 --> 25:21.676
Don't let him go.

25:24.590 --> 25:27.438
I'll take care of him.

26:25.232 --> 26:28.494
<i>October 14, 1914.</i>

26:28.561 --> 26:30.252
<i>My dear Isabel:</i>

26:30.321 --> 26:32.688
<i>Today our sons are leaving home...</i>

26:32.753 --> 26:36.201
<i>to defend an England
they have never seen.</i>

26:36.273 --> 26:38.957
<i>I am unable to stop them.</i>

26:43.666 --> 26:49.263
<i>I have tried to shelter our sons
from all the madness...</i>

26:49.330 --> 26:52.265
<i>and now they go to seek it.</i>

27:42.291 --> 27:44.146
Be careful.

28:06.677 --> 28:08.171
You don't have to go.

28:55.127 --> 28:56.502
Good-bye.

28:58.232 --> 29:00.272
Don't worry, Father.

29:00.344 --> 29:01.718
Take care.

29:09.047 --> 29:11.436
I'll bring you the Kaiser's helmet.

29:11.512 --> 29:14.360
Bring yourself back.
That would please me more.

29:15.448 --> 29:17.303
Yes, sir.

29:35.289 --> 29:37.296
- Take care of Samuel.
- I will.

30:31.835 --> 30:34.072
<i>Colonel Ludlow told me:</i>

30:34.139 --> 30:36.921
<i>"Ride with them to Calgary.</i>

30:36.988 --> 30:39.606
<i>Bring back the horses."</i>

30:39.676 --> 30:42.229
<i>"Damn fools", he called them.</i>

30:44.668 --> 30:47.832
<i>The Colonel would not have his sons...</i>

30:47.900 --> 30:50.900
<i>ride off to war on old nags...</i>

30:50.972 --> 30:53.427
<i>damn fools or not.</i>

31:10.045 --> 31:11.420
Let's join them.

31:12.925 --> 31:14.300
Bring your plate.

31:18.205 --> 31:19.579
He'll be back.

31:20.606 --> 31:22.777
May we join you?
Sit down. 

31:23.805 --> 31:25.977
Feeling lonely in there.

31:26.046 --> 31:27.420
Sit here.

31:30.046 --> 31:31.453
What's her name, Two?

31:31.518 --> 31:34.453
Lady. Tristan's Lady.

31:34.526 --> 31:37.276
In the story, Tristan's lady was Isolde.

31:37.343 --> 31:39.994
- Do you know who Isolde was?
- No.

31:41.887 --> 31:44.734
Your daughter needs an education.

31:44.799 --> 31:49.654
She can read and write, Colonel.
School might be awkward for her.

31:49.726 --> 31:53.207
- I'll teach her myself.
- May I help?

31:53.279 --> 31:57.502
Yeah. I'll teach her
history and mathematics.

31:57.567 --> 32:02.074
With your permission, Decker,
and yours, Pet.

32:02.144 --> 32:03.321
What do you think?

32:10.047 --> 32:11.771
What will she do
with all this education?

32:11.840 --> 32:14.840
She'll live a richer,
fuller life, of course.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.975
She's a half-breed.

32:18.048 --> 32:19.739
Not in this house.

32:19.808 --> 32:23.005
- Tristan calls me a half-breed.
- He does?

32:23.073 --> 32:25.407
He says I'm half-gopher
and half-hawk.

32:31.745 --> 32:35.357
- After her chores.
- Yeah.

32:35.425 --> 32:37.280
- To us all.
- To you, sir.

32:37.345 --> 32:40.192
- And you, miss.
- And to the boys.

33:07.650 --> 33:09.657
Get back to your unit.

33:09.730 --> 33:11.738
Those boys are boring.

33:11.810 --> 33:13.949
I'd rather have you watching my back.

33:18.691 --> 33:20.065
Go, mate.

33:40.612 --> 33:42.946
<i>February 3, 1915.</i>

33:43.971 --> 33:45.498
<i>Dear Susannah:</i>

33:45.572 --> 33:48.223
<i>The horror of this place
is indescribable.</i>

33:50.212 --> 33:52.798
<i>Nothing is as I thought it would be.</i>

33:52.868 --> 33:55.737
Keep your distance!
Keep your spacing!

33:55.812 --> 33:58.846
<i>Tonight, as I prayed for the souls 
of those who died so terribly...</i>

33:58.917 --> 34:00.542
<i>yet so bravely...</i>

34:00.612 --> 34:03.482
<i>I admit that I also prayed
for personal glory.</i>

34:03.557 --> 34:07.005
<i>Is that wrong to want
to distinguish myself gloriously...</i>

34:07.077 --> 34:09.215
<i>in combat as my father did?</i>

34:09.284 --> 34:12.155
<i>Tristan and Alfred
watch over me so carefully...</i>

34:12.228 --> 34:13.887
<i>I may never get the opportunity.</i>

34:22.150 --> 34:23.710
Charge!

34:37.734 --> 34:39.806
Goddamn it!

34:40.838 --> 34:42.693
- Where are you hit?
- It's just a scratch.

34:47.654 --> 34:49.443
<i>Susannah, I see now...</i>

34:49.510 --> 34:52.827
<i>not that my father was right,
but that I was naive.</i>

34:52.902 --> 34:55.772
- Let me up, damn it!
- Stay down!

34:56.806 --> 34:58.367
Fall back!

34:58.439 --> 35:00.512
<i>Still, we place our bodies
in God's keeping.</i>

35:00.583 --> 35:02.917
<i>We go into battle honorably...</i>

35:02.983 --> 35:04.445
<i>full of confidence...</i>

35:04.519 --> 35:06.275
<i>with His name on our lips.</i>

35:06.343 --> 35:08.732
- We're pinned here.
- We'll wait.

35:22.312 --> 35:24.865
- Give him a hand.
- Help him down.

35:55.753 --> 35:57.182
Goddamn.

36:03.018 --> 36:06.630
<i>Susannah:
I try to guard against despair...</i>

36:06.698 --> 36:11.368
<i>but there are moments when it seems
that all human decency is broken down.</i>

36:11.434 --> 36:13.507
<i>Alfred will recover from his wounds...</i>

36:13.579 --> 36:17.027
<i>but he and Tristan seem
to have drifted apart, or worse.</i>

36:17.099 --> 36:19.586
<i>I cannot understand it.</i>

36:19.658 --> 36:21.830
<i>I miss you more
than you can imagine.</i>

36:23.019 --> 36:26.368
<i>You are all that is clean
and cool and pure.</i>

36:27.659 --> 36:30.147
<i>I close my eyes and think of you.</i>

36:30.219 --> 36:34.791
<i>I now regret that we listened to everyone 
and waited to marry.</i>

36:34.859 --> 36:37.674
<i>Even more, I regret that I left
before we could be together...</i>

36:37.739 --> 36:39.746
<i>as we planned, my beloved.</i>

36:41.739 --> 36:44.838
<i>Please stay on at the ranch
and wait for me.</i>

36:44.908 --> 36:47.112
<i>Don't let Father worry.</i>

36:48.299 --> 36:50.601
<i>I know God's mercy will protect me...</i>

36:50.668 --> 36:52.195
<i>aided considerably by Tristan...</i>

36:52.268 --> 36:54.472
<i>who seems to be in France
less to fight the Germans...</i>

36:54.540 --> 36:56.548
<i>than to act as my nursemaid.</i>

36:58.380 --> 37:00.933
<i>Be well, my love.</i>

37:01.004 --> 37:02.947
<i>Your own, Samuel.</i>

37:04.589 --> 37:07.239
Captain needs me to translate this 
before tonight's reconnaissance.

37:07.308 --> 37:10.091
- Alfred will want to see you.
- I'll be there.

37:10.157 --> 37:12.132
- Yeah?
- Go on.

37:33.742 --> 37:35.749
Where's Samuel?

37:35.822 --> 37:37.829
He's translating.
He'll be here.

37:37.902 --> 37:40.074
Boy, that's a good one.

37:40.142 --> 37:42.509
- Vino?
- Put that away.

37:47.182 --> 37:50.314
- They said you'll get a medal.
- Yes.

37:50.383 --> 37:53.831
- They're sending me home.
- I'm glad for you.

37:53.903 --> 37:56.041
I'm an officer.
I belong with my men.

37:56.110 --> 37:57.420
Horseshit.

37:57.487 --> 38:00.072
What's left of them.

38:00.143 --> 38:02.958
MacKenzie was just brought in.
His leg's turned bad.

38:03.024 --> 38:05.135
He said--

38:05.135 --> 38:06.118
What?

38:07.343 --> 38:08.772
What is it?

38:08.847 --> 38:12.360
He said your brother volunteered
to take his place...

38:12.431 --> 38:14.319
on the reconnaissance with the captain.

38:14.384 --> 38:17.417
Goddamn it!
I told you to stay with him!

41:01.943 --> 41:04.529
- I'm here!
- Where? I can't see.

41:06.455 --> 41:08.048
I can't move!

41:12.088 --> 41:13.681
I'm coming!

41:38.073 --> 41:40.342
I got you now.

41:42.233 --> 41:44.404
You're doing good.

41:45.753 --> 41:47.128
We're going home.

42:19.259 --> 42:21.048
God, no!

43:02.301 --> 43:05.367
Goddamn you, God!

45:08.322 --> 45:09.849
Tristan, it's me.

45:15.074 --> 45:18.490
<i>March 20, 1915.</i>

45:18.562 --> 45:20.897
<i>Dear Father and Susannah:</i>

45:20.962 --> 45:25.370
<i>I am being discharged from the Army,
but I cannot come home yet.</i>

45:25.443 --> 45:27.931
<i>I will ask Grand father Ludlow in Cornwall...</i>

45:28.003 --> 45:30.141
<i>to let me join him at sea.</i>

45:31.587 --> 45:34.172
<i>As for our beloved Samuel...</i>

45:34.243 --> 45:36.610
<i>all I can send home is his heart.</i>

45:36.676 --> 45:38.531
<i>Alfred will bring it back.</i>

45:40.483 --> 45:43.615
<i>He should be buried up 
in the box canyon...</i>

45:43.684 --> 45:45.855
<i>where he used to draw the birds.</i>

45:46.883 --> 45:49.665
<i>Your son, Tristan.</i>

46:05.604 --> 46:09.535
He certainly was the best
of all of us, wasn't he? 

46:15.493 --> 46:16.867
Good night.

46:32.005 --> 46:34.394
What you saw before Samuel left--

46:36.166 --> 46:38.173
Please, don't--

46:38.246 --> 46:40.101
No, I want to.

46:46.406 --> 46:47.966
It is Samuel I loved.

46:50.246 --> 46:52.221
All right.

46:57.734 --> 46:59.906
Tristan will be back someday.

47:03.687 --> 47:05.116
Your father will be pleased.

47:11.527 --> 47:15.455
<i>Susannah was to return to Boston 
on the morning train...</i>

47:15.527 --> 47:17.862
<i>but a norther blew for three days...</i> 

47:17.928 --> 47:19.935
<i>and drifted over the tracks.</i>

47:20.007 --> 47:25.223
<i>The Colonel insisted
she stay on until spring.</i>

47:26.248 --> 47:29.761
<i>The house was too empty, he said.</i>

47:29.832 --> 47:33.215
<i>This was still her home, he told her.</i>

47:36.169 --> 47:38.503
<i>He should have let her go.</i>

47:38.568 --> 47:42.213
<i>But how could he have known
what would happen?</i>

47:46.888 --> 47:49.507
<i>She was not to blame.</i>

47:49.577 --> 47:53.221
<i>She was like the water
that freezes in the rock...</i>

47:53.289 --> 47:55.461
<i>and split sit apart.</i>

47:57.130 --> 48:01.385
<i>It was no more her fault
than it is the fault of the water...</i>

48:01.449 --> 48:03.970
<i>when the rock shatters.</i>

48:14.410 --> 48:16.265
You know how much I--

48:17.610 --> 48:19.497
You know how much I loved Samuel.

48:20.523 --> 48:24.003
And I think you know--

48:32.491 --> 48:35.142
Out of respect for him,
I wanted to say it here.

48:35.211 --> 48:37.862
I think you know that...

48:40.683 --> 48:42.090
I'm in love with you.

48:44.651 --> 48:47.466
From the first moment I saw you...

48:47.531 --> 48:49.539
like in a novel.

48:55.532 --> 49:00.835
That's my mother's overblown
romantic imagination coming out in me.

49:08.269 --> 49:11.138
You're not making this very easy for me.

49:12.332 --> 49:13.958
Sorry.

49:15.212 --> 49:19.075
Is there any hope
that you could learn to love me?

49:21.389 --> 49:23.625
Not the way you love Samuel,
of course...

49:23.694 --> 49:27.468
but enough to--

49:31.118 --> 49:33.223
We could make a life together.

49:34.413 --> 49:35.788
A happy life.

49:40.334 --> 49:41.959
I don't think so.

49:46.254 --> 49:49.832
Sounds like you're not sure, though.
Maybe there's a chance?

49:56.175 --> 50:00.583
- What?
- I can only cause you pain, Alfred.

50:02.895 --> 50:05.350
Why not let me be the judge of that?

50:15.215 --> 50:17.550
I didn't break it, but I can fix it.

50:17.615 --> 50:20.911
I can put the damn wheel back on
and take it off myself.

50:20.976 --> 50:22.831
Go take a nap.

50:34.896 --> 50:36.968
- What?
- Look!

51:21.298 --> 51:23.470
I'm going into town if--

52:04.725 --> 52:06.579
Welcome home, son.

53:17.303 --> 53:20.271
I couldn't save him.

53:20.343 --> 53:22.678
Of course you couldn't.

53:33.624 --> 53:34.998
It's all right.

54:02.906 --> 54:05.240
Have a nice ride today?

54:16.826 --> 54:18.681
Excuse me, Father.

54:38.939 --> 54:40.434
Tristan, please.

55:44.029 --> 55:46.997
When are you planning to be married?

55:47.070 --> 55:48.761
Good morning.

55:53.950 --> 55:55.379
Damn you.

55:55.454 --> 55:57.756
You will marry her.

55:58.783 --> 56:01.718
- Make an honest woman of her?
- Yes!

56:03.871 --> 56:05.781
God damn you to hell.

56:07.070 --> 56:09.940
Yes, I will marry her,
if she'll have me.

56:10.015 --> 56:11.924
If she'll have you?

56:15.871 --> 56:17.726
Do you love her?

56:19.871 --> 56:22.871
Or did you seduce her just to spite me?

56:22.943 --> 56:24.470
That's not what I did.

56:25.632 --> 56:28.796
- What about Samuel?
- What?

56:28.864 --> 56:30.489
You tell me about Samuel.

56:30.560 --> 56:33.495
We all loved Samuel.
Samuel is dead.

56:33.568 --> 56:35.128
How convenient for you.

56:36.736 --> 56:39.605
Because you love her,
I will forgive you for that.

56:39.680 --> 56:42.714
Once. You say that again,
and we're not brothers.

56:51.873 --> 56:54.240
You know you can't make her happy.

56:54.305 --> 56:56.128
I'm gonna try.

56:58.593 --> 57:00.120
You will fail.

57:13.954 --> 57:15.809
I'll be leaving today.

57:26.114 --> 57:28.219
I wish you both all the best.

57:36.707 --> 57:38.562
- Good-bye, son.
- Wish me luck.

57:38.627 --> 57:40.002
Good luck.

58:07.236 --> 58:10.203
<i>September 7, 1915.</i>

58:10.276 --> 58:12.131
<i>Dearest Mother:</i>

58:12.196 --> 58:16.604
<i>I think I may have found
my place in this world.</i>

58:16.676 --> 58:20.932
<i>Helena is a city turned modern overnight...</i>

58:20.997 --> 58:23.844
<i>bursting with all the energy
and vitality...</i>

58:23.909 --> 58:25.883
<i>of our times.</i>

58:25.957 --> 58:28.161
<i>I feel alive here.</i>

58:36.197 --> 58:37.921
<i>There is much opportunity for anyone...</i>

58:37.990 --> 58:40.925
<i>who dedicates himself to his labors.</i>

58:40.998 --> 58:45.024
<i>Already, I have acquired a reputation
for honesty and fair dealing...</i>

58:45.094 --> 58:50.244
<i>and I am pleased to call some 
of Helena's most influential citizens...</i>

58:50.310 --> 58:52.285
<i>my friends.</i>

58:52.358 --> 58:56.286
<i>They are determined to see
this city grow, as am I.</i>

58:56.358 --> 58:58.627
We're proud of you.

59:00.679 --> 59:03.974
<i>Mother, 
thank you for your kind letter.</i>

59:04.039 --> 59:05.500
<i>You knew my hopes.</i>

59:05.575 --> 59:10.048
<i>That you understand my disappointment
is a great comfort to me.</i>

59:11.559 --> 59:15.171
<i>Everynight I pray for the grace
to forgive Tristan.</i>

59:16.199 --> 59:18.054
<i>I know you understand.</i>

59:18.119 --> 59:20.453
<i>Your loving son, Alfred.</i>

01:00:15.562 --> 01:00:17.088
Quit it! 

01:00:32.683 --> 01:00:34.057
Goddamn it!

01:01:09.484 --> 01:01:13.313
If we have a boy,
I'd like to call him Samuel.

01:01:14.604 --> 01:01:17.255
And if it's a girl, Isabel.

01:01:20.204 --> 01:01:22.855
I'll still love you.

01:01:22.924 --> 01:01:26.372
You'll tolerate me
because of how much I love you.

01:01:39.886 --> 01:01:41.260
Nothing.

01:01:54.190 --> 01:01:56.940
I heard from your mother.

01:01:57.006 --> 01:02:00.935
She says Alfred has hooked up
with those damn O'Banion brothers.

01:02:01.007 --> 01:02:06.571
- He's doing well.
- Alfred will do well wherever he is.

01:02:06.638 --> 01:02:10.054
- Except here with us.
- That's my fault.

01:02:10.127 --> 01:02:13.672
- I didn't say that.
- Couldn't save Samuel either, could I?

01:02:13.743 --> 01:02:16.711
Don't you dare say that.
That was in God's hands.

01:02:18.767 --> 01:02:20.196
Was it?

01:02:22.288 --> 01:02:25.900
Colonel! Lost a couple calves
near Camas Canyon.

01:02:25.968 --> 01:02:28.204
- Might be a grizzly.
- My grizzly?

01:02:43.249 --> 01:02:46.216
- You take him, Tristan.
- Damn right I will.

01:03:04.753 --> 01:03:09.510
I don't know why Tristan
did not kill that damn old bear.

01:03:10.449 --> 01:03:11.823
The Old Ones say:

01:03:11.890 --> 01:03:13.832
"When a man and an animal...

01:03:13.906 --> 01:03:15.913
have spilled each other's blood...

01:03:15.986 --> 01:03:18.222
they become one."

01:03:19.698 --> 01:03:22.316
I said four beers, Mr. Sachtleben.

01:03:22.386 --> 01:03:24.295
And I said no Indians.

01:03:27.026 --> 01:03:30.856
- He's quite civilized, I assure you.
- Yeah?

01:03:30.930 --> 01:03:32.785
- Give him a beer.
- Stay out of it.

01:03:32.850 --> 01:03:35.338
- My father said four.
- He heard me.

01:03:35.410 --> 01:03:37.298
We're about to reach an understanding.

01:03:37.363 --> 01:03:39.502
Just give him a goddamn beer!

01:03:39.571 --> 01:03:42.222
Stay out of it!

01:03:42.291 --> 01:03:45.106
Damn you.
You're a damn fool.

01:03:45.171 --> 01:03:47.756
You're spoiling for a fight
with a man who outweighs you.

01:03:47.827 --> 01:03:51.024
As we speak, he's searching
for some kind of a weapon.

01:03:51.091 --> 01:03:52.553
Isn't that right?

01:03:52.628 --> 01:03:55.824
To split your stupid skull
and kill you and good riddance.

01:03:55.891 --> 01:03:57.266
Leave it!

01:03:58.292 --> 01:04:01.587
- Yes, sir?
- I want four beers, now.

01:04:03.892 --> 01:04:07.569
The lousy owner says
he doesn't want to serve Indians.

01:04:11.572 --> 01:04:13.231
Get back.

01:04:14.388 --> 01:04:16.461
Do you see this man?

01:04:16.533 --> 01:04:20.624
Do you?
His name is One Stab.

01:04:20.692 --> 01:04:24.555
He's a venerated Cree elder and has 
counted coup on hundreds of his enemies.

01:04:24.628 --> 01:04:27.498
He's our friend.
He's thirsty.

01:04:53.334 --> 01:04:58.549
I think it was the bear's voice
he heard deep inside him...

01:04:58.615 --> 01:05:02.357
growling low of dark, secret places.

01:06:43.099 --> 01:06:45.914
Were you going to say good-bye?

01:06:56.860 --> 01:06:58.453
How long will you be gone?

01:07:00.059 --> 01:07:02.426
Not long.
A few months.

01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:10.548
I can make it better for you.

01:07:16.861 --> 01:07:18.387
If we'd had a child...

01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:24.824
or if I were pregnant,
would you still go?

01:07:27.740 --> 01:07:29.115
Yes.

01:07:32.029 --> 01:07:33.917
Just give me a chance.

01:07:33.981 --> 01:07:35.356
Don't do that.

01:07:41.853 --> 01:07:43.708
Look at me.

01:07:48.382 --> 01:07:50.553
Please, look at me.

01:08:02.943 --> 01:08:04.798
I'll wait for you.

01:08:06.462 --> 01:08:08.317
However long it takes.

01:08:13.215 --> 01:08:15.768
I'll wait for you forever.

01:08:34.464 --> 01:08:36.798
Will he come back?

01:08:36.863 --> 01:08:38.238
I don't know.

01:08:44.863 --> 01:08:47.068
Stab says yes.

01:09:25.826 --> 01:09:28.160
<i>April 20, 1918.</i>

01:09:28.225 --> 01:09:30.081
<i>Dear Tristan:</i>

01:09:30.145 --> 01:09:33.113
<i>It has been months now,
and still no word.</i>

01:09:34.947 --> 01:09:36.636
<i>The only sign that you are alive...</i>

01:09:36.706 --> 01:09:41.278
<i>is a tattered parcel that arrived today
from New Guinea...</i>

01:09:41.345 --> 01:09:42.872
<i>covered with strange writing...</i>

01:09:42.947 --> 01:09:46.395
<i>and containing what appears to be
a native bracelet.</i> 

01:09:47.715 --> 01:09:50.082
<i>Meant for me, I presume.</i>

01:09:50.147 --> 01:09:52.002
<i>But perhaps not.</i>

01:09:53.412 --> 01:09:56.794
<i>Do you still care to know
what is happening here?</i>

01:09:56.867 --> 01:09:59.518
<i>Cattle prices continue to fall...</i>

01:09:59.587 --> 01:10:01.759
<i>and winter seems never ending.</i>

01:10:05.252 --> 01:10:07.107
<i>Why don't you write?</i>

01:10:09.092 --> 01:10:11.677
<i>Are you afraid to tell me
you're never coming back?</i>

01:10:16.197 --> 01:10:18.106
<i>Alfred continues to do well.</i>

01:10:19.908 --> 01:10:23.651
<i>His business has expanded 
to include financial concerns in Chicago...</i>

01:10:23.717 --> 01:10:25.091
<i>and Washington.</i>

01:10:25.156 --> 01:10:27.011
<i>I don't pretend to understand.</i>

01:10:27.077 --> 01:10:30.110
<i>He wants us to send Isabel Two
to boarding school in Chicago...</i>

01:10:30.181 --> 01:10:32.636
<i>but she adamantly refuses
to leave the ranch.</i>

01:10:32.709 --> 01:10:35.360
<i>I think she, too,
is waiting for you.</i>

01:10:36.869 --> 01:10:39.487
<i>I have nowhere to send this letter...</i> 

01:10:40.709 --> 01:10:43.524
<i>and no reason to believe
you wish to receive it.</i>

01:10:50.630 --> 01:10:52.637
<i>I write it only for myself.</i>

01:10:54.470 --> 01:10:58.780
<i>I will hide it away with all the things
left unsaid and undone...</i>

01:10:58.854 --> 01:11:00.709
<i>between us.</i>

01:11:07.431 --> 01:11:10.911
<i>December 12, 1919.</i>

01:11:10.982 --> 01:11:12.870
<i>Dear Susannah:</i>

01:11:13.991 --> 01:11:16.577
<i>I have become a hunter.</i>

01:11:21.543 --> 01:11:25.504
<i>Tell Stab there are creatures here
that cannot even be found in books.</i>

01:11:29.031 --> 01:11:31.487
<i>I have killed them all.</i>

01:11:51.912 --> 01:11:54.400
<i>All we had is dead.</i>

01:11:54.473 --> 01:11:56.000
<i>As I am dead.</i>

01:11:57.289 --> 01:11:58.947
<i>Marry another.</i>

01:12:13.514 --> 01:12:16.165
Colonel, it looks like
we've got company.

01:12:36.074 --> 01:12:39.206
- I have come to ask for your blessing.
- My blessing?

01:12:39.275 --> 01:12:41.511
You see, these gentlemen and--

01:12:41.578 --> 01:12:44.328
And a great many others,
I might add.

01:12:44.395 --> 01:12:47.363
They're urging me to run for office.

01:12:47.435 --> 01:12:49.856
- What office?
- The United States Congress.

01:12:49.931 --> 01:12:52.233
That's how highly we think of your son.

01:12:59.692 --> 01:13:02.659
And what do you gentlemen 
hope to get out of this?

01:13:05.516 --> 01:13:07.207
I beg your pardon?

01:13:07.276 --> 01:13:10.571
I've spoken plain English, sir.
What do you want for yourselves?

01:13:11.596 --> 01:13:14.181
Father, I don't think
that these gentlemen--

01:13:14.252 --> 01:13:17.155
Did you ask that question
or do you believe these gentlemen...

01:13:17.228 --> 01:13:20.327
would back you out of patriotic duty
and your inestimable worth?

01:13:20.396 --> 01:13:23.298
You forget yourself, Father.
I am no longer a child.

01:13:23.372 --> 01:13:25.380
Colonel, the Congress--

01:13:25.453 --> 01:13:28.519
Congress is government, sir.
I worked for the government once.

01:13:28.589 --> 01:13:29.963
The issues that we--

01:13:30.029 --> 01:13:34.153
Indians! 
Indians were the issue in those days.

01:13:35.597 --> 01:13:37.604
There is nothing as grotesque...

01:13:37.677 --> 01:13:40.165
as the meeting of a child with a bullet...

01:13:40.237 --> 01:13:42.954
or an entire village slaughtered
while sleeping.

01:13:43.021 --> 01:13:46.021
That was the government's resolution
of that particular issue.

01:13:46.094 --> 01:13:49.323
I've seen nothing since then
to persuade me it's gained...

01:13:49.389 --> 01:13:51.756
in wisdom, common sense or humanity.

01:13:53.998 --> 01:13:59.432
Gentlemen, my father, 
for whom I have the deepest respect...

01:13:59.502 --> 01:14:04.488
says that the government
has neither wisdom nor humanity.

01:14:04.558 --> 01:14:08.748
I will then consider it
my absolute duty as my father's son...

01:14:08.815 --> 01:14:13.834
to bring both wisdom and humanity
to the United States Congress.

01:14:15.823 --> 01:14:19.368
I thank you for your blessing.
Gentlemen.

01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:36.335
- Gentlemen, wait for me in the cars.
- Yes. Certainly.

01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:52.623
Are you all right?
What's wrong?

01:15:09.362 --> 01:15:14.730
I don't know what to say.
Tristan's always been wild.

01:15:15.762 --> 01:15:19.918
- You love him for that.
- Do I?

01:15:23.282 --> 01:15:25.169
I suppose I do.

01:15:26.930 --> 01:15:28.523
He does love you.

01:15:34.098 --> 01:15:35.920
She's to be your brother's wife.

01:15:39.315 --> 01:15:43.538
Yes, though you better
remind him of that fact.

01:15:43.603 --> 01:15:45.130
He's not here to defend himself.

01:15:45.203 --> 01:15:49.458
No, but I see you are here
to defend him and what is his...

01:15:49.523 --> 01:15:53.615
even though he's abandoned her and you.

01:15:53.683 --> 01:15:56.432
I won't even speak
of who else he abandoned.

01:15:56.500 --> 01:15:58.093
Damn you, boy.

01:15:58.164 --> 01:16:01.230
Don't you blame my son for Samuel's death!

01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:04.147
Samuel chose to be a soldier,
and soldiers die...

01:16:04.212 --> 01:16:06.186
sent to their slaughter
by men in government.

01:16:06.260 --> 01:16:08.016
Parasites like you!

01:16:08.083 --> 01:16:09.807
Damn and blast you!

01:16:09.876 --> 01:16:12.593
Damn you.
And damn you too!

01:16:12.660 --> 01:16:15.213
Shut your mouth.
Leave her out of this!

01:16:15.284 --> 01:16:17.324
Get out of my house
and get off my land.

01:16:17.396 --> 01:16:20.909
Why? Because I want
to serve my country as you did?

01:16:20.980 --> 01:16:24.014
Or because, like you,
I love a woman who doesn't love me?

01:16:25.045 --> 01:16:28.689
He used her and deserted her,
your darling Tristan.

01:16:28.756 --> 01:16:30.382
Alfred, don't. Please.

01:16:30.453 --> 01:16:32.176
I loved her!

01:16:34.004 --> 01:16:35.947
I love her still.

01:16:39.093 --> 01:16:42.127
He stole her from me.
If you want to know the truth...

01:16:42.197 --> 01:16:45.426
he stole her from Samuel
before the war.

01:16:45.493 --> 01:16:47.468
God help me, I'll kill you.

01:16:49.365 --> 01:16:53.489
Here.
Read your darling Tristan's letter.

01:17:00.438 --> 01:17:01.845
You deserve to be happy.

01:17:30.167 --> 01:17:33.615
<i>Late that night we found
the Colonel on the floor...</i> 

01:17:33.687 --> 01:17:36.502
<i>beside a cold fire.</i>

01:17:36.567 --> 01:17:38.258
<i>He could not move.</i>

01:17:39.928 --> 01:17:42.416
<i>His hair turned white over night...</i>

01:17:42.488 --> 01:17:44.822
<i>and he became an old man.</i>

01:17:46.168 --> 01:17:50.096
<i>And after that,
Tristan sent no more letters.</i>

01:17:51.609 --> 01:17:53.780
<i>As the years passed by...</i>

01:17:53.848 --> 01:17:56.816
<i>we would hear that someone
had seen him on a ship...</i>

01:17:56.888 --> 01:18:00.663
<i>going up some river
no white man had gone up before.</i>

01:18:02.169 --> 01:18:04.504
<i>Stories came to us.</i>

01:18:04.569 --> 01:18:06.958
<i>Strange stories.</i>

01:18:08.249 --> 01:18:11.282
<i>And then, for years,
there was nothing.</i>

01:18:16.249 --> 01:18:18.421
<i>He was lost to us.</i>

01:18:18.490 --> 01:18:20.978
<i>That was all we knew.</i>

01:18:21.050 --> 01:18:24.662
<i>But every year,
in the Moon of the Falling Leaves...</i>

01:18:24.730 --> 01:18:30.098
<i>I would dream that the bear's voice
inside him had grown silent...</i>

01:18:30.170 --> 01:18:33.683
<i>and that Tristan might again
come to live in the world.</i>

01:18:34.715 --> 01:18:36.657
<i>But then the winter would come.</i>

01:18:37.691 --> 01:18:39.546
<i>And then another spring.</i>

01:18:40.571 --> 01:18:43.538
<i>And still he stayed away.</i>

01:19:12.252 --> 01:19:14.008
What the hell is he doing?

01:20:09.534 --> 01:20:11.706
She's a mean old bitch,
but she's yours.

01:20:17.855 --> 01:20:19.229
Welcome home.

01:20:26.975 --> 01:20:29.364
Old man!
Where's Father?

01:20:53.888 --> 01:20:56.255
He had a stroke some years ago.

01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:58.426
He can't talk now.

01:21:03.457 --> 01:21:04.984
Hello, Father.

01:21:16.929 --> 01:21:18.784
He wants to celebrate.

01:21:42.659 --> 01:21:44.033
I'm happy too.

01:22:13.700 --> 01:22:15.642
Father, this is for you.

01:22:20.421 --> 01:22:23.934
"Colonel William Ludlow,
from his son Tristan."

01:22:25.061 --> 01:22:26.849
I didn't know.

01:22:29.573 --> 01:22:33.315
These are boars' tusks,
made by a Javanese warrior.

01:22:33.381 --> 01:22:35.388
He, too, was a great man.

01:22:53.062 --> 01:22:57.056
I have other things for Mother
and Little Izzy and Susannah.

01:23:02.278 --> 01:23:03.652
What is it?

01:23:13.542 --> 01:23:15.233
Alfred and Miss Susannah...

01:23:15.302 --> 01:23:17.790
were married several years ago.

01:23:20.903 --> 01:23:23.075
Your brother's a congressman now.

01:23:24.743 --> 01:23:27.078
They have a big, new place in Helena.

01:23:31.943 --> 01:23:34.431
It's as it should be.

01:23:34.503 --> 01:23:37.634
Cattle prices dropped
after the war ended.

01:23:39.144 --> 01:23:41.926
The Colonel don't seem to care.

01:23:41.992 --> 01:23:43.901
He lost nearly everything he had.

01:23:45.832 --> 01:23:47.261
We'll make it back...

01:23:47.336 --> 01:23:51.079
on horses or something else
if we have to.

01:23:56.904 --> 01:23:59.271
He's saying that your brother 
voted for the Volstead Act.

01:23:59.337 --> 01:24:02.653
Did he? 
You suggesting I become a boot legger?

01:24:02.729 --> 01:24:06.275
Good money in bootlegging,
if you know what you're doing.

01:24:06.345 --> 01:24:07.905
Screw the government.

01:24:07.977 --> 01:24:09.832
Screw them.

01:25:09.228 --> 01:25:11.595
Forever turned out to be too long.

01:25:13.580 --> 01:25:14.955
I know.

01:25:25.388 --> 01:25:27.177
Here.

01:25:27.244 --> 01:25:29.513
I don't want it.

01:25:36.428 --> 01:25:40.040
They told me that this was magic...

01:25:40.109 --> 01:25:43.884
that whoever wore it
would be protected.

01:25:51.245 --> 01:25:52.620
Keep it.

01:26:11.470 --> 01:26:13.892
Don't you want to see Alfred?

01:26:15.471 --> 01:26:17.991
It's probably better that I don't.

01:26:22.543 --> 01:26:24.682
Tell him hello...

01:26:24.751 --> 01:26:27.304
and congratulations.

01:27:05.489 --> 01:27:06.863
He likes you.

01:27:10.449 --> 01:27:11.824
Welcome home.

01:27:13.713 --> 01:27:15.087
Isabel?

01:27:18.513 --> 01:27:20.139
I want you to have him.

01:27:21.073 --> 01:27:23.888
I have something for you too.

01:27:23.953 --> 01:27:25.808
I brought it back.

01:27:26.833 --> 01:27:29.168
It's from Ierapetra. 

01:27:29.234 --> 01:27:31.056
- That's in--
- Crete.

01:27:31.122 --> 01:27:33.162
- Yeah.
- I know where it is.

01:27:33.234 --> 01:27:36.049
Your father taught me European history.

01:27:38.195 --> 01:27:41.195
A little girl.
That's me, right?

01:27:44.274 --> 01:27:45.867
Thank you.

01:28:10.836 --> 01:28:13.586
Okay, we'll see you in a few days.

01:28:16.436 --> 01:28:18.291
Don't wait on me.
I'll be fine.

01:28:19.796 --> 01:28:23.724
<i>It was then that Tristan came 
into the quiet heart...</i>

01:28:23.796 --> 01:28:25.803
<i>of his life.</i>

01:28:25.876 --> 01:28:29.324
<i>The bear inside him was sleeping.</i>

01:28:31.476 --> 01:28:34.291
<i>It is hard to tell of happiness.</i>

01:28:35.797 --> 01:28:37.804
<i>Time goes by...</i>

01:28:37.876 --> 01:28:40.527
<i>and we feel safe too soon.</i>

01:28:41.845 --> 01:28:44.693
- I heard the oddest news.
- Yes?

01:28:44.757 --> 01:28:46.131
Yes.

01:28:47.157 --> 01:28:49.645
Tristan...

01:28:49.717 --> 01:28:51.092
is back.

01:28:53.237 --> 01:28:55.092
Yes, I know.

01:28:56.758 --> 01:28:58.132
You know?

01:28:59.318 --> 01:29:01.172
How do you know?

01:29:05.014 --> 01:29:06.388
I saw him.

01:29:07.958 --> 01:29:12.563
He had the audacity to come here 
just to see you?

01:29:12.631 --> 01:29:15.249
He wanted to see you,
but thought you'd get upset.

01:29:16.854 --> 01:29:18.677
He might be right.

01:29:26.359 --> 01:29:28.693
What did he--

01:29:28.759 --> 01:29:30.449
What did he say?

01:29:30.519 --> 01:29:31.894
He said to say hello...

01:29:33.079 --> 01:29:34.868
and congratulations.

01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:40.498
Silly me.

01:29:42.199 --> 01:29:44.534
He told you the news?

01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:47.957
What do you think?

01:29:50.424 --> 01:29:53.326
Come on.
It's perfectly absurd.

01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:56.403
Marrying Isabel Two.

01:29:56.472 --> 01:30:00.531
God, she's practically our sister.

01:30:02.201 --> 01:30:05.016
She can't be more than, what, 19?

01:30:06.041 --> 01:30:07.448
Twenty.

01:30:07.513 --> 01:30:10.710
I can't imagine what the hell
Decker is thinking of...

01:30:10.777 --> 01:30:13.079
to allow this.

01:30:13.145 --> 01:30:16.528
Perhaps he's thinking
of his daughter's happiness.

01:30:19.513 --> 01:30:23.190
Happiness?
With Tristan?

01:30:24.505 --> 01:30:28.368
You, of all people,
should know how impossible that is.

01:30:28.441 --> 01:30:30.776
I'm not Isabel Two.

01:30:40.442 --> 01:30:42.450
<i>June 2, 1921.</i>

01:30:42.523 --> 01:30:43.897
<i>Dear Tristan:</i>

01:30:43.962 --> 01:30:47.410
<i>I was so pleased to hear
of your coming marriage.</i>

01:30:49.243 --> 01:30:50.901
<i>Your father must be very happy.</i>

01:30:51.930 --> 01:30:54.134
<i>Isabel Two is like a daughter to him...</i>

01:30:55.803 --> 01:30:58.618
<i>as she was named
after your own mother.</i>

01:30:58.683 --> 01:31:02.458
<i>It seems as though it was always
meant to be, doesn't it?</i>

01:31:08.123 --> 01:31:09.585
Damnation.

01:32:36.287 --> 01:32:38.142
Samuel Decker Ludlow.

01:32:46.048 --> 01:32:47.903
<i>Dearest Tristan:</i>

01:32:50.048 --> 01:32:53.180
<i>Alfred and I were delighted
to hear of your son's birth.</i>

01:32:53.248 --> 01:32:57.023
<i>We hoped for a child of our own,
but of that I despair.</i>

01:32:58.048 --> 01:33:00.219
<i>I know Alfred thinks of you often.</i>

01:33:00.288 --> 01:33:03.584
<i>I look forward to the day 
when we all might see one another again.</i>

01:33:07.489 --> 01:33:10.140
<i>Your son bears a proud and noble name.</i>

01:33:10.209 --> 01:33:11.900
<i>I know he will live up to it.</i>

01:33:16.609 --> 01:33:18.780
<i>Please give my love to Isabel Two...</i>

01:33:18.849 --> 01:33:21.337
<i>and to your father and everyone else.</i>

01:33:21.409 --> 01:33:23.930
<i>Yours always, Susannah.</i>

01:33:34.690 --> 01:33:37.177
Evening, gentlemen.

01:33:37.250 --> 01:33:40.000
Been meaning to talk to you
about one or two things.

01:33:40.066 --> 01:33:41.441
By all means.

01:33:41.506 --> 01:33:43.873
As you know perfectly well...

01:33:43.938 --> 01:33:45.793
we handle the liquor around here.

01:33:45.858 --> 01:33:49.753
Now, you've been a small-time operator.

01:33:49.827 --> 01:33:51.736
An amateur, frankly.

01:33:51.810 --> 01:33:55.585
Lately, your shipments
have been getting a little fat...

01:33:55.650 --> 01:33:57.985
and my patience
has been getting a little thin.

01:33:58.051 --> 01:34:01.826
So the next time you get in our way...

01:34:01.891 --> 01:34:03.265
will be the last time.

01:34:04.451 --> 01:34:07.233
Excuse me.
I appreciate it.

01:34:07.299 --> 01:34:10.016
Perhaps you're wondering
why you're not dead already.

01:34:11.044 --> 01:34:13.662
Because your brother is Congressman Ludlow.

01:34:13.732 --> 01:34:15.903
And that's it.
That's all.

01:34:22.212 --> 01:34:23.739
Kenneth. Thomas.

01:34:49.413 --> 01:34:51.006
Can't you just say hello?

01:35:04.294 --> 01:35:08.004
- Hello, Alfred.
- Hello, Tristan.

01:35:16.391 --> 01:35:18.693
- Who's this young man?
- This is Samuel.

01:35:25.446 --> 01:35:27.421
She's beautiful.

01:35:33.191 --> 01:35:34.565
Let me see.

01:35:42.535 --> 01:35:46.813
- Who is this lady?
- I'm your Aunt Susannah.

01:35:49.736 --> 01:35:53.348
I used to know your Uncle Samuel
who died in the war.

01:35:57.288 --> 01:36:00.419
- You look like him.
- That's what Grandpa says.

01:36:03.496 --> 01:36:06.496
He was very brave and very good.

01:36:06.569 --> 01:36:08.227
Grandpa says that too.

01:36:08.296 --> 01:36:11.842
Grandpa says I can have 
Uncle Samuel's gun when I'm bigger.

01:36:11.913 --> 01:36:13.768
Would you come and see it?

01:36:19.817 --> 01:36:22.239
I'd love to.

01:36:22.313 --> 01:36:23.688
Sometime.

01:36:26.218 --> 01:36:29.698
- He's a fine boy.
- He is.

01:36:31.498 --> 01:36:36.069
- Is Father well?
- As well as can be expected.

01:36:40.938 --> 01:36:43.359
- I wish--
- Pardon the intrusion.

01:36:45.098 --> 01:36:48.394
Excuse me.
We're ready for your speech now.

01:36:48.458 --> 01:36:50.181
I'll be there in a minute.

01:36:50.250 --> 01:36:51.625
Thank you.

01:37:05.899 --> 01:37:09.030
- We'll meet again soon?
- I'd like that.

01:37:39.469 --> 01:37:40.843
What's this?

01:37:47.917 --> 01:37:49.772
Go and get Tynert.

01:37:54.125 --> 01:37:56.395
I think you missed a bump, Stab.

01:38:14.382 --> 01:38:15.593
Jesus!

01:38:15.663 --> 01:38:18.314
Sir, we have information
that you're transporting goods...

01:38:18.383 --> 01:38:20.237
in violation of the Volstead Act.

01:38:20.303 --> 01:38:23.052
If you mean a case of Irish whiskey
for my father, I am.

01:38:23.119 --> 01:38:24.645
Give it up.

01:38:25.678 --> 01:38:27.085
He'll be disappointed.

01:38:57.904 --> 01:39:00.043
Hold him down.

01:39:01.264 --> 01:39:02.988
Let's get out of here.

01:39:03.057 --> 01:39:06.155
- There's an envelope in his pocket.
- Now.

01:39:11.601 --> 01:39:16.457
My brother told you
to stay out of our way.

01:39:21.458 --> 01:39:23.116
Put him in the car.

01:40:57.973 --> 01:41:00.624
- I don't want to see him.
- Father--

01:41:21.911 --> 01:41:23.318
I'm so very sorry.

01:41:30.231 --> 01:41:32.882
Father won't see me, even now?

01:41:34.391 --> 01:41:37.970
He blames the government for Isabel's--

01:41:45.111 --> 01:41:47.445
There's something we have to talk about.

01:41:49.272 --> 01:41:52.752
The officer you beat almost died.

01:41:54.007 --> 01:41:55.862
Now, everyone understands...

01:41:57.912 --> 01:42:00.727
but you'll have to plead guilty...

01:42:00.792 --> 01:42:02.166
serve 30 days.

01:42:02.233 --> 01:42:04.818
And the one who shot his gun?

01:42:07.192 --> 01:42:09.047
He was...

01:42:10.232 --> 01:42:11.639
reprimanded.

01:42:12.665 --> 01:42:16.342
- The O'Banions?
- Nothing.

01:42:17.433 --> 01:42:19.059
You have to let it go.

01:42:19.129 --> 01:42:23.057
It was a terrible, tragic accident.

01:42:23.129 --> 01:42:25.682
Listen to me.

01:42:25.753 --> 01:42:28.404
You let this go now.

01:42:28.473 --> 01:42:30.807
You got in over your head.

01:42:35.193 --> 01:42:36.917
I'll need a minute.

01:43:16.987 --> 01:43:18.842
I'm so sorry.

01:43:20.956 --> 01:43:22.866
We all loved her.

01:43:26.012 --> 01:43:27.387
How are you?

01:43:29.084 --> 01:43:30.459
I'm fine.

01:43:38.077 --> 01:43:39.833
We never get to see you.

01:43:45.437 --> 01:43:48.252
I gave a speech the other day.

01:43:48.317 --> 01:43:50.488
- You did?
- Yes.

01:43:50.557 --> 01:43:53.045
My first public engagement.

01:44:01.118 --> 01:44:05.274
It was on the responsibilities of women in--

01:44:11.678 --> 01:44:13.533
It's good to see you.

01:44:38.879 --> 01:44:40.570
I'm sorry.

01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:51.803
I still sometimes dream... 

01:44:51.871 --> 01:44:54.043
that I'm the mother of your children.

01:45:04.320 --> 01:45:05.749
I wanted her to die.

01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:11.648
Maybe I even wanted Samuel to die.

01:45:18.081 --> 01:45:21.213
You had nothing to do
with Samuel's death. 

01:45:21.281 --> 01:45:23.550
And you had nothing to do
with Isabel's death.

01:45:25.762 --> 01:45:27.136
Didn't I?

01:45:29.281 --> 01:45:30.656
Go home.

01:45:33.698 --> 01:45:35.935
Go home to Alfred.

01:46:01.602 --> 01:46:02.977
Where were you?

01:46:04.643 --> 01:46:06.814
I just went out for a walk.

01:46:06.883 --> 01:46:10.658
I needed a walk.
What are you doing home?

01:46:10.723 --> 01:46:13.374
Your doctor rang,
said you missed your appointment.

01:46:13.443 --> 01:46:15.832
I called home.
You weren't here. I--

01:46:16.867 --> 01:46:18.809
I feel very tired.

01:46:20.164 --> 01:46:21.854
I'm going to bed.

01:52:15.379 --> 01:52:19.308
<i>You have won her.
I am bringing her home.</i>

01:52:19.380 --> 01:52:21.136
<i>Alfred.</i>

01:52:56.021 --> 01:52:58.029
I followed all the rules:

01:53:00.181 --> 01:53:02.352
man's and God's.

01:53:04.181 --> 01:53:05.708
And you--

01:53:07.542 --> 01:53:08.916
You followed none.

01:53:14.742 --> 01:53:17.076
And they all loved you more.

01:53:20.982 --> 01:53:23.633
Samuel, Father...

01:53:27.703 --> 01:53:31.151
and even my own wife.

01:53:42.263 --> 01:53:45.459
I'd like a moment alone with her.

01:54:27.865 --> 01:54:29.392
When Samuel died--

01:54:34.425 --> 01:54:37.076
When Samuel died, I cursed God.

01:54:46.970 --> 01:54:50.101
Did I damn everybody around me
as well as myself?

01:54:53.626 --> 01:54:58.361
You are not damned.

01:54:58.426 --> 01:55:01.241
I won't allow that.

01:55:02.266 --> 01:55:04.820
You're not damned!

01:55:46.749 --> 01:55:49.083
Samuel, this is a gentleman's gun.

01:55:49.148 --> 01:55:51.352
It's smaller,
but it's just as powerful.

01:55:51.420 --> 01:55:54.803
That's what you want when you grow up, 
isn't it? A gun.

01:55:57.021 --> 01:55:58.876
Samuel, come here!

01:56:04.702 --> 01:56:09.655
Run along now. Go with Pet.
Get him in the house.

01:56:13.214 --> 01:56:15.188
He's a fine boy.

01:56:20.670 --> 01:56:22.841
You know we're not here to arrest you.

01:56:39.135 --> 01:56:41.623
You take me to the woods
so my boy won't see.

01:56:42.687 --> 01:56:44.149
I don't want my boy to see.

01:56:46.271 --> 01:56:47.766
Let's get on with it.

01:56:50.495 --> 01:56:52.600
- Father.
- Colonel Ludlow, sir.

01:56:53.600 --> 01:56:58.558
What's going on here?

01:59:12.006 --> 01:59:15.868
You don't have to be a genius to know
they'll come after you for this.

01:59:16.998 --> 01:59:18.372
Yeah.

01:59:24.391 --> 01:59:25.765
Yeah?

01:59:29.158 --> 01:59:32.420
I want to ask you
to watch over my children.

01:59:35.558 --> 01:59:37.413
Watch over Samuel.

01:59:45.895 --> 01:59:47.837
Brother, it would be an honor.

02:00:10.120 --> 02:00:13.732
<i>How much I wanted to take scalps...</i>

02:00:13.801 --> 02:00:15.972
<i>but it was not my kill.</i>

02:00:31.241 --> 02:00:34.208
<i>That night, we buried the bodies...</i> 

02:00:34.281 --> 02:00:39.016
<i>and dumped the carina deep pool
in the upper Missouri.</i>

02:00:39.081 --> 02:00:42.049
<i>I remember when he was a boy...</i>

02:00:42.121 --> 02:00:46.529
<i>I thought Tristan would never live
to be an old man.</i>

02:00:46.601 --> 02:00:49.416
<i>I was wrong about that.</i>

02:00:49.481 --> 02:00:53.093
<i>I was wrong about many things.</i>

02:00:53.162 --> 02:00:57.091
<i>It was those who loved him most
who died young.</i>

02:00:58.282 --> 02:01:02.057
<i>He was a rock
they broke themselves against...</i>

02:01:02.122 --> 02:01:04.937
<i>however much he tried to protect them.</i>

02:01:06.347 --> 02:01:08.933
<i>But he had his honor...</i>

02:01:09.003 --> 02:01:11.174
<i>and a long life...</i>

02:01:11.243 --> 02:01:13.894
<i>and he saw his children grow...</i>

02:01:13.963 --> 02:01:16.451
<i>and raise their own families.</i>

02:01:19.883 --> 02:01:23.179
<i>Tristan died in 1963...</i>

02:01:23.243 --> 02:01:26.538
<i>in the Moon of the Popping Trees.</i>

02:01:26.604 --> 02:01:29.735
<i>He was last seen up 
in the north country...</i>

02:01:29.803 --> 02:01:32.935
<i>where the hunting was still good.</i>

02:01:33.004 --> 02:01:35.491
<i>His grave is unmarked...</i>

02:01:35.563 --> 02:01:38.378
<i>but it does not matter.</i>

02:01:38.444 --> 02:01:41.891
<i>He had always lived
in the borderland anyway:</i>

02:01:41.964 --> 02:01:45.576
<i>somewhere between this world
and the other.</i>

02:02:23.086 --> 02:02:25.093
<i>It was a good death.</i>

02:02:26.305 --> 02:02:32.294
