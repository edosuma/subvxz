WEBVTT

00:02.383 --> 00:05.163
No. No -
I should've said it well before now.

00:05.197 --> 00:06.395
I love you.

00:06.397 --> 00:09.515
James attempted suicide on the ship
the night before we docked.

00:09.517 --> 00:10.715
No.

00:10.717 --> 00:12.035
He's looking for answers.

00:12.037 --> 00:14.115
You have to find a story
he can believe.

00:14.117 --> 00:16.235
The best lie is
a version of the truth.

00:16.236 --> 00:19.515
Before we got married,
I was in love with someone.

00:19.517 --> 00:23.235
All this time
I... I thought it was me!

00:23.237 --> 00:24.675
I want you at the hospital.

00:24.677 --> 00:26.195
And I'll fight to keep you there.

00:26.197 --> 00:28.115
Enough to make her your enemy too?

00:28.117 --> 00:29.395
She saved his life!

00:29.397 --> 00:30.835
And now she threatens to ruin it.

00:30.837 --> 00:32.795
And you repay her
by running her out of town?

00:32.797 --> 00:34.315
I don't want it to come between us.

00:34.317 --> 00:37.997
But it's a risk you're clearly
prepared to take. Go on - get out.

02:11.317 --> 02:12.957
Hi.
Hi.

02:24.197 --> 02:25.875
Jack, good morning.

02:25.877 --> 02:29.035
Morning. Before breakfast?

02:29.037 --> 02:30.475
Yes.

02:30.477 --> 02:34.635
I felt it might be appropriate to
offer an apology for my behaviour
last time we met.

02:34.637 --> 02:36.677
I apologise.

02:38.517 --> 02:39.755
Hello?

02:39.757 --> 02:40.795
But?

02:40.797 --> 02:42.077
Oh, there are no buts.

02:43.237 --> 02:45.435
You made your case regarding
Miss Adams

02:45.437 --> 02:49.515
and while I disagree - strongly -
it is your decision to make.

02:49.517 --> 02:52.475
I will be watching
to see how things proceed.

02:52.477 --> 02:55.115
That sounds like a but to me.

02:55.117 --> 02:57.037
I hope she rewards your confidence,
Jack.

02:58.117 --> 03:01.635
There is nothing worse than taking
a chance on someone who disappoints,
is there?

03:01.637 --> 03:03.077
Good morning.

03:08.197 --> 03:09.835
Sorry about that.

03:09.837 --> 03:11.115
Where were we?

03:11.117 --> 03:13.235
It's a heavy patient load -
you think you can manage it?

03:13.237 --> 03:14.755
I'll let you know if I can't.

03:14.757 --> 03:16.955
I might join you
for the maiden voyage.

03:16.957 --> 03:19.517
I think she's more than up to
the challenge, Doctor.

03:20.997 --> 03:23.317
OK by you?
You're the boss.

03:24.917 --> 03:26.157
I'll be out in a tick.

03:29.557 --> 03:31.235
They'll miss you at the house.

03:31.237 --> 03:32.435
You know what happened?

03:32.437 --> 03:33.757
No, but I know Doris.

03:34.677 --> 03:36.755
So where will you stay?
I'm not sure yet.

03:36.757 --> 03:38.435
You won't give us a second go?

03:38.437 --> 03:40.115
OK.

03:40.117 --> 03:42.237
Well, good luck for today.
Thank you.

03:46.317 --> 03:48.315
So I assume this has
something to do with Elizabeth?

03:48.317 --> 03:49.795
That was her on the phone.

03:49.797 --> 03:52.475
Or do you chaperone
every nurse on her first day?

03:52.477 --> 03:53.677
She called to apologise.

03:54.877 --> 03:57.395
Cross my heart.
She works in mysterious ways.

03:57.397 --> 03:59.797
And yet here you are.
So something about it worried you.

04:02.997 --> 04:05.675
If it happens to get around
that you don't have her blessing,

04:05.677 --> 04:07.517
I want it known
you well and truly have mine.

04:09.117 --> 04:10.237
Then thank you.

04:15.637 --> 04:17.235
I'm sorry I'm late.

04:17.237 --> 04:19.957
In your condition,
morning apologies are not required.

04:20.757 --> 04:22.437
Is everything alright?
Yes.

04:23.757 --> 04:25.115
Now that we're all here,

04:25.117 --> 04:26.755
considering recent events,

04:26.757 --> 04:31.437
I think it's best
we avoid Sarah Adams until
she has a chance to get settled.

04:32.757 --> 04:34.515
What does that mean?
We can't see her?

04:34.517 --> 04:36.755
For the time being.
Eminently sensible.

04:36.757 --> 04:37.835
Whatever you think's best.

04:37.837 --> 04:40.115
You had me running to the station
after her yesterday.

04:40.117 --> 04:41.955
Nothing personal...
Now this!

04:41.957 --> 04:44.035
Drop it.
No, I will not. It's absurd.

04:44.037 --> 04:45.275
You know she's my friend.

04:45.277 --> 04:46.875
She's an acquaintance...
Mother.

04:46.877 --> 04:48.195
Who shot your horse.

04:48.197 --> 04:49.195
You're not helping.

04:49.197 --> 04:50.595
You've made your wishes clear.

04:50.597 --> 04:52.597
That's quite sufficient explanation.

04:55.117 --> 04:58.157
It's not fair.
The subject is closed.

04:59.517 --> 05:01.237
Anna, it is for the best.

05:01.997 --> 05:03.235
For now.

05:03.237 --> 05:04.717
And I'm running late
for the knackery.

05:06.397 --> 05:07.517
Mind if I come?

05:10.037 --> 05:11.157
I'll meet you at the sheds.

05:12.397 --> 05:14.477
I'll just get changed.
See you later, darling.

05:19.317 --> 05:20.877
Excuse me.

05:22.037 --> 05:24.717
Is there some tidal pull
I'm unaware of?

05:29.517 --> 05:31.955
Father!
I know what you're going to say.

05:31.957 --> 05:34.995
Oh, you are just like Grandmother -
refusing to even listen.

05:34.997 --> 05:36.395
There's nothing more to be said.

05:36.397 --> 05:38.835
Do you have any idea
how infuriating it is

05:38.837 --> 05:40.475
to be the only one
not let in on something

05:40.477 --> 05:42.237
but expected to go along with it?

05:42.877 --> 05:46.515
Sarah revealed something
which has caused tension
with your grandmother.

05:46.517 --> 05:48.475
About what?
Anna.

05:48.477 --> 05:49.675
About who?
Anna, please.

05:49.677 --> 05:50.757
It's James.

05:52.117 --> 05:55.955
Well, it's not me, and if she's
telling Grandmother, it isn't her.

05:55.957 --> 05:58.275
You've got nothing to hide,
and she hardly knows Olivia,

05:58.277 --> 06:00.597
so... it's James.

06:01.757 --> 06:04.197
And some things need
to remain private.

06:05.197 --> 06:06.197
Even within the family.

06:07.757 --> 06:08.877
Like his lover in London?

06:11.757 --> 06:14.077
He was so miserable on the ship
I put two and two together.

06:15.117 --> 06:16.517
Does Olivia know?

06:19.597 --> 06:21.395
They discussed it last night.

06:21.397 --> 06:23.437
I believe she's been
very understanding.

06:24.197 --> 06:25.755
She must need someone to talk to.

06:25.757 --> 06:27.595
She'll ask if she does.
I'm going to offer.

06:27.597 --> 06:29.757
Anna, please.
I'm a grown woman.

06:31.117 --> 06:33.437
It's time you stop being
so shocked when I act like one.

06:48.557 --> 06:50.115
The Goldbergs.

06:50.117 --> 06:51.917
Only ones of your lot around.

06:52.557 --> 06:54.195
Their niece Leah has TB.

06:54.197 --> 06:55.757
She's not in a sanatorium?

06:57.677 --> 06:59.555
Well, the things she went through
as a little 'un...

06:59.557 --> 07:01.275
it's best she's treated at home.

07:01.277 --> 07:02.477
I see.

07:03.557 --> 07:06.117
It's a grim story.
I'm sure they'll tell it
if they want to.

07:07.997 --> 07:10.317
They thought it was better
for business to lose the 'berg'.

07:18.477 --> 07:21.635
Leah, we have guests.

07:21.637 --> 07:23.315
Hello.

07:23.317 --> 07:24.395
Hi.

07:24.397 --> 07:26.717
Should I stay?
That's up to you.

07:27.677 --> 07:28.835
It's alright, Aunty.

07:28.837 --> 07:31.117
I'll be outside
if you need anything.

07:32.677 --> 07:34.555
Thank you.
Now, just ignore me.

07:34.557 --> 07:36.237
All yours, Sister.

07:37.277 --> 07:38.517
Don't be too tough on her.

07:40.957 --> 07:42.755
Hello.
Hi.

07:42.757 --> 07:43.955
I'm Sister Adams.

07:43.957 --> 07:45.115
But why don't you call me Sarah,

07:45.117 --> 07:47.397
since we'll be seeing
so much of each other?

07:48.197 --> 07:49.837
You're prettier than the last nurse.

07:50.317 --> 07:53.477
Well, you're prettier than my last
patient - just don't tell him that.

07:56.197 --> 07:57.475
I'm getting better, I think.

07:57.477 --> 07:58.755
Slowly.

07:58.757 --> 08:02.117
Well, that's good. I'll take
your temperature first, alright?

08:04.397 --> 08:05.675
You like films, I see.

08:05.677 --> 08:07.395
I wish I could go.

08:07.397 --> 08:09.315
I hate being trapped in here.

08:09.317 --> 08:10.755
Well, it's not forever.

08:10.757 --> 08:12.555
You know, when I lived in London,

08:12.557 --> 08:15.555
I used to go to the pictures
four or five times a week.

08:15.557 --> 08:17.717
Oh, that's a lot.

08:19.837 --> 08:22.355
It's good to forget
the real world sometimes.

08:22.357 --> 08:25.035
Have you seen
'Gentlemen Prefer Blondes'?

08:25.037 --> 08:26.677
With Marilyn Monroe? Not yet.

08:32.277 --> 08:33.277
You alright?

08:39.116 --> 08:41.517
M-Marilyn's my favourite.

08:42.317 --> 08:44.597
But I'm not allowed
to put her pictures up.

08:45.397 --> 08:46.917
Aunty calls her a loose woman.

08:48.397 --> 08:49.555
Well, I'll make you a deal.

08:49.557 --> 08:52.995
When it comes out here,
I'll go see it
and tell you all about it, alright?

08:52.997 --> 08:54.637
Just don't tell Aunty.

08:55.557 --> 08:56.877
No talking.

09:39.117 --> 09:41.397
Livy, are you in there?
Yes, I was just, um...

09:42.597 --> 09:44.555
Sorry. Can we talk?

09:44.557 --> 09:45.677
I was just, um...

09:47.037 --> 09:49.317
I was just tidying up.

09:50.317 --> 09:51.755
In my experience,
it works much better

09:51.757 --> 09:54.555
if you come up with the lie
before you get caught snooping.

09:54.557 --> 09:56.995
I wasn't!
Oh, don't be embarrassed -
I'd do the same.

09:56.997 --> 09:59.517
Did you at least get to see
what she looks like?

10:00.157 --> 10:01.435
What do you mean?

10:01.437 --> 10:03.917
I'd be looking for a photo of her
too if I were you.

10:07.557 --> 10:09.317
You knew about her.

10:09.957 --> 10:11.157
I guessed.

10:11.637 --> 10:12.917
I'm not a total twit.

10:14.837 --> 10:17.355
Olivia, I am so sorry.
I didn't at all...
No, perhaps you're right.

10:17.357 --> 10:19.477
You saw what I couldn't,
and I'm his wife.

10:21.077 --> 10:22.477
She must be something, mustn't she?

10:23.597 --> 10:24.875
To have made him love her so.

10:24.877 --> 10:27.675
But he married you, didn't he?

10:27.677 --> 10:28.795
He chose you.

10:28.797 --> 10:30.117
Did he?

10:31.077 --> 10:33.637
Or did he just settle on me
because the couldn't have her?

10:34.677 --> 10:37.637
No, don't say that.
He said she was unsuitable.

10:38.717 --> 10:39.997
In what way?

10:41.037 --> 10:43.677
What could have made him love
someone who was so wrong for him?

10:44.877 --> 10:47.437
I need to see who she is.
Was.

10:49.517 --> 10:51.115
I know James,

10:51.117 --> 10:56.157
and... I can't imagine him
not keeping some sort of memento.

10:57.837 --> 10:58.997
He will have a photo.

11:00.557 --> 11:01.997
Somewhere.

11:04.757 --> 11:06.315
She's getting better.

11:06.317 --> 11:07.397
Do you think?

11:08.157 --> 11:11.437
It's a long road ahead, but she's
optimistic, and that's a good thing.

11:12.557 --> 11:14.597
There are days
when she's not so hopeful.

11:15.277 --> 11:16.915
Well, I am here to help with those.

11:16.917 --> 11:18.795
A small thank you.
Oh.

11:18.797 --> 11:20.395
Strudel.

11:20.397 --> 11:22.637
I make excuses to drop by
just so I can get this.

11:23.637 --> 11:25.515
Should be opening a bakery,
not just sewing.

11:25.517 --> 11:27.557
Well, we never just sew.

11:28.477 --> 11:31.355
If there's anything you need in that
way, it would be our pleasure also.

11:31.357 --> 11:33.157
Grossen dank.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.595
I'm Jewish.

11:38.597 --> 11:40.317
No!

11:41.797 --> 11:43.675
Jewish!

11:43.677 --> 11:45.357
You must join us for Shabbos, yeah?

11:46.117 --> 11:48.397
I would love to.
Oh.

11:50.037 --> 11:51.435
I reckon you made their day.

11:51.437 --> 11:52.797
They made mine.

11:53.957 --> 11:57.395
Ah, so, next is Eve Walker
and her son Colin.

11:57.397 --> 12:00.075
She's eight months pregnant,
he's diabetic.

12:00.077 --> 12:02.277
First, though,
there's someone not on the list.

12:03.637 --> 12:07.197
Lives across the road. He's a mate.
We served together.

12:09.357 --> 12:10.797
Why don't we take him some strudel?

12:14.797 --> 12:17.355
You predecessor
had her problems with him.
Why?

12:17.357 --> 12:19.797
His troubles are mental,
not physical.

12:20.757 --> 12:23.195
He was a POW building
the Siam Railway.

12:23.197 --> 12:25.357
That sort of experience
can break the best of men.

12:26.477 --> 12:28.277
Been in and out of institutions.

12:29.397 --> 12:32.235
He beat the grog -
now he won't leave the house.

12:32.237 --> 12:33.997
It's not really my area.

12:34.997 --> 12:36.237
You have a way with you.

12:38.837 --> 12:42.757
How long since he went out?
Oh, about two months. This is it.

12:44.637 --> 12:45.997
Tried my best to buck him up.

12:46.997 --> 12:48.835
You've been keeping your eye on him,
then?

12:48.837 --> 12:49.997
Drop in every day after work.

12:57.397 --> 12:59.197
Bill? Just me.

13:01.277 --> 13:03.757
He's having a good day - the
wireless hasn't been on for weeks.

13:05.917 --> 13:06.957
Knock, knock!

13:31.197 --> 13:32.675
Jack.

13:32.677 --> 13:33.995
I'll wait for the police.

13:33.997 --> 13:36.315
Uh... you finish your rounds.
I'd rather stay.

13:36.317 --> 13:37.357
I'm fine.

13:38.637 --> 13:41.357
He was your friend.
Take the car. Do your job, please.

13:42.677 --> 13:44.157
Get your stuff! Go!

14:45.672 --> 14:48.976
I always thought your grandmother
would've been a natural
for this kind of work.

14:50.392 --> 14:51.952
She's subtler,
but just as effective.

14:54.172 --> 14:56.092
That said, she was there
when you needed someone.

14:56.932 --> 14:58.450
I wasn't.

14:58.452 --> 14:59.770
I didn't give you the chance.

14:59.772 --> 15:01.172
I meant when your mother died.

15:02.572 --> 15:06.532
I didn't talk with you, Anna...
didn't deal with it.

15:09.132 --> 15:10.850
No more secrets for us.

15:10.852 --> 15:12.332
Hmm?

15:14.892 --> 15:15.932
No more secrets.

15:17.412 --> 15:18.572
Good.

15:40.332 --> 15:43.210
How long have you been there?
I've never seen you
like that before.

15:43.212 --> 15:44.612
Like what?

15:46.932 --> 15:48.972
Like you'd look
if I wake up with you.

15:50.332 --> 15:51.890
Don't worry -
I don't wanna read your diary.

15:51.892 --> 15:53.890
It's not a diary. I'm not a child.

15:53.892 --> 15:55.050
Why are you so angry?

15:55.052 --> 15:56.292
You scared me.

16:01.972 --> 16:03.452
I told you it wasn't a diary.

16:04.212 --> 16:06.170
I've heard of this book.
It's a dirty book.

16:06.172 --> 16:08.410
No, it's just honest.
Some things
shouldn't be written about.

16:08.412 --> 16:09.810
Oh, God - you sound like an old man.

16:09.812 --> 16:11.370
Well, dirty's dirty,
no matter how old you are.

16:11.372 --> 16:13.570
And dirty can be in the mind.
You should read it.
I don't want to.

16:13.572 --> 16:15.530
Well, how do you know it's dirty
if you have haven't read it?

16:15.532 --> 16:17.130
I know what Father Joe would say.
Oh, Father Joe.

16:17.132 --> 16:19.050
This is banned - you can
get arrested for having this.

16:19.052 --> 16:20.132
Where did you get it?

16:21.052 --> 16:23.090
We visited Aunty Carolyn
on the way home

16:23.092 --> 16:24.970
and I took it
when she wasn't watching.

16:24.972 --> 16:27.010
And stealing too.
You shouldn't have this.

16:27.012 --> 16:28.730
Gino! Gino, please!

16:28.732 --> 16:30.090
Don't, Gino!

16:30.092 --> 16:32.052
It's not filth,
despite what they all say.

16:33.452 --> 16:35.492
Why would you read such things?

16:36.172 --> 16:40.012
All it talks about
is what we all feel and do.

16:42.212 --> 16:45.172
Read it, and tell me
you've never had those thoughts.

16:45.892 --> 16:47.012
Never wondered.

16:48.252 --> 16:49.492
Go on, read it.

16:50.372 --> 16:52.412
And if you don't like it,
I'll throw it away.

16:53.812 --> 16:56.012
You promise?
Yes.

17:03.572 --> 17:04.852
I think I'll go for a walk.

17:21.811 --> 17:23.369
You wished to see me?
Yes.

17:23.372 --> 17:25.012
You and James have been sent a gift.

17:26.012 --> 17:27.212
From whom?

17:29.452 --> 17:32.810
Henry Swanson -
a friend of the family.

17:32.812 --> 17:34.370
I wouldn't exactly call him that,

17:34.372 --> 17:37.132
but he has tried to lure George
into politics on numerous occasions.

17:39.652 --> 17:41.332
It's too much.

17:42.452 --> 17:44.732
It is... a very generous gesture.

17:46.972 --> 17:48.692
Oh. Nothing, dear.

17:53.452 --> 17:54.570
He hardly knows James.

17:54.572 --> 17:56.650
Exactly. Well.

17:56.652 --> 17:57.930
"Well" what?

17:57.932 --> 17:59.332
It's a thoughtful gift.

18:00.012 --> 18:02.652
You're being obtuse
because you're still angry with me.

18:03.372 --> 18:04.730
Think about it.

18:04.732 --> 18:06.210
A gift can be just a gift.

18:06.212 --> 18:08.010
Sir Henry is a politician.

18:08.012 --> 18:09.370
Everything he does has a purpose.

18:09.372 --> 18:10.692
The question is what?

18:11.732 --> 18:14.370
Well, I haven't seen Sir Henry since
he wanted me to run for the House.

18:14.372 --> 18:16.090
Perhaps he's gearing up
for another attempt.

18:16.092 --> 18:17.650
No, no -
this is a personal approach,

18:17.652 --> 18:20.372
which suggests his intentions
are personal too.

18:21.492 --> 18:22.972
Let's just have it, Mother.

18:24.012 --> 18:26.972
Sir Henry has a son.
Quite the golden-haired child.

18:27.732 --> 18:29.010
And?

18:29.012 --> 18:30.290
And unless I've misheard,

18:30.292 --> 18:33.132
he is proving an elusive target
on the marriage market.

18:33.932 --> 18:35.730
Perhaps they're looking for
the right girl.

18:35.732 --> 18:37.172
Anna.

18:43.372 --> 18:44.612
Well?

18:46.212 --> 18:47.290
I know now why it's banned.

18:47.292 --> 18:49.370
It's not all like that part.

18:49.372 --> 18:50.812
It's wonderful writing.

18:51.812 --> 18:53.330
Do women really have such thoughts?

18:53.332 --> 18:54.772
Yes.

18:57.092 --> 18:58.650
Do you?

18:58.652 --> 18:59.892
Sometimes.

19:01.812 --> 19:02.972
With me?

19:03.812 --> 19:05.172
Is that wrong?

19:08.372 --> 19:09.492
No.

19:10.972 --> 19:12.252
You do too?

19:14.492 --> 19:15.852
Yes.

19:16.612 --> 19:18.332
There's nothing wrong
with things like that.

19:33.972 --> 19:35.132
See?

19:55.772 --> 19:57.492
It doesn't mean
that we should do them.

20:03.252 --> 20:04.332
Yet.

20:20.852 --> 20:21.892
Yes?

20:26.052 --> 20:27.332
Can't be finished already.

20:29.772 --> 20:31.132
I wanted to check on you.

20:32.092 --> 20:33.412
Well, it's with the police now.

20:34.652 --> 20:36.852
Bill's record's no use now
except to the coroner.

20:39.892 --> 20:41.810
It's not your fault what happened,
you know that?

20:41.812 --> 20:43.772
This isn't a conversation
we should have.

20:44.572 --> 20:46.730
You can't be alright.
You saw that man every day.

20:46.732 --> 20:47.772
No, I didn't.

20:48.332 --> 20:50.452
I didn't see him yesterday.
I was out looking for you.

20:57.212 --> 20:58.570
That was unfair.

20:58.572 --> 20:59.772
I shouldn't have told you.

21:00.932 --> 21:02.052
If it's the truth.

21:05.892 --> 21:07.253
We think we know people, don't we?

21:08.532 --> 21:09.812
So sure of their limits.

21:13.012 --> 21:15.253
Jack...
I'm sure you've got things
to get on with, Sister.

21:55.292 --> 21:56.972
I thought I heard music.

21:57.892 --> 22:00.130
Look what
a friend of your father's sent.

22:00.132 --> 22:02.850
He even included this -
'The Anniversary Waltz'.

22:02.852 --> 22:06.052
"To play every year
on the special day."

22:07.092 --> 22:08.450
Sir Henry Swanson did this?

22:08.452 --> 22:11.092
And his wife. Isn't that lovely?

22:12.892 --> 22:13.890
No?

22:13.892 --> 22:16.452
I just wouldn't have taken him
for the sentimental type.

22:18.172 --> 22:19.770
Your grandmother was the same.
What?

22:19.772 --> 22:20.972
Suspicious.

22:22.492 --> 22:24.252
You all get this look about you.

22:26.492 --> 22:27.930
I'm sorry.

22:27.932 --> 22:31.452
No, you're right. It is.
It's lovely, honestly.

22:33.212 --> 22:36.492
It's just that London
was all politics and favours.

22:37.492 --> 22:38.730
I hoped it would be different here.

22:38.732 --> 22:42.892
London is in the past,
like that woman.

22:44.052 --> 22:47.690
Concentrate on anniversaries
and babies

22:47.692 --> 22:49.732
and not on anything back then.

22:54.206 --> 22:55.586
I'm trying.

23:37.657 --> 23:39.375
Ah, thank you.

23:39.377 --> 23:41.617
Is that what I think it is?

23:42.066 --> 23:44.506
I'm thanking the Swansons
for their generosity.

23:44.629 --> 23:48.709
And are there any intentions
to return the... kindness?

23:48.833 --> 23:51.151
We're inviting them up
for a weekend.

23:51.153 --> 23:53.391
Are we?
We are.

23:53.393 --> 23:54.713
If there's nothing else...

23:58.473 --> 24:01.991
I don't mind Anna
being exposed to options,

24:01.993 --> 24:04.231
but I won't have her bartered.

24:04.233 --> 24:07.551
It's high time Anna took
the next step into womanhood,

24:07.553 --> 24:09.793
and it's my duty to help her.

24:13.873 --> 24:16.233
Bartered!

24:21.473 --> 24:22.831
Dr Duncan.

24:22.833 --> 24:24.511
I was just coming to see you.

24:24.513 --> 24:26.231
Are you alright?

24:26.233 --> 24:27.831
Poor Mr Gregory.
I'm fine.

24:27.833 --> 24:29.093
Are you sure?

24:29.131 --> 24:31.049
Doctor...
Doris!

24:31.051 --> 24:32.529
I'm sorry.

24:32.531 --> 24:35.329
I know I can sometimes
be a little curious,

24:35.331 --> 24:38.051
but I'm honestly
just worried about you.

24:39.131 --> 24:41.129
I'm fine. Really.

24:41.131 --> 24:42.569
Such a shock.

24:42.571 --> 24:44.409
Such a tragedy.

24:44.411 --> 24:46.411
And Miss Adams was with you, I hear.

24:47.851 --> 24:49.409
I see. Yes. Well...

24:49.411 --> 24:53.251
If a cuppa would help,
you always knows where to find me.

26:18.051 --> 26:19.769
Hi.

26:19.771 --> 26:21.209
Rugged first day?

26:21.211 --> 26:22.409
Oh, baptism by fire.

26:22.411 --> 26:24.209
Doris is around
chewing the ear off the patients,

26:24.211 --> 26:26.129
but I think she's here to see you.
Oh.

26:26.131 --> 26:27.569
Might have to
slip out the back door.

26:27.571 --> 26:28.929
Sister Adams.

26:28.931 --> 26:31.849
Alma, dear, perhaps a moment alone.
No worries.

26:31.851 --> 26:32.929
Good luck.

26:32.931 --> 26:34.209
Mrs Collins.

26:34.211 --> 26:35.769
A dreadful day.

26:35.771 --> 26:40.129
I hope you don't judge our sleepy
little town on one misfortune.

26:40.131 --> 26:44.129
And perhaps you might extend
the same indulgence to me.

26:44.131 --> 26:49.409
If I overstep the mark, if indeed I
did, I promise never to do so again.

26:49.411 --> 26:51.569
I cannot see you homeless.

26:51.571 --> 26:54.249
I have a room. Thank you.
At least for now.

26:54.251 --> 26:56.849
Indeed, indeed -
with Mr Briggs, I hear.

26:56.851 --> 27:02.409
Ah, well, I suggest nothing,
of course, but others may.

27:02.411 --> 27:04.769
I'm happy with the way things are.

27:04.771 --> 27:08.409
Perhaps on a day like today,
it's better to forgive and forget.

27:08.411 --> 27:09.889
I'm sure.

27:09.891 --> 27:12.249
Sister...
I am sure.

27:12.251 --> 27:13.409
I see.

27:13.411 --> 27:16.129
Well, no-one can say I didn't try.

27:16.131 --> 27:18.969
I only hope that tongues
less charitable than mine

27:18.971 --> 27:21.011
don't make you regret your decision.

27:25.611 --> 27:29.769
If you ask me, he's definitely
buttering you up for parliament.

27:29.771 --> 27:31.489
Why didn't he do it
when he asked you before?

27:31.491 --> 27:35.971
Oh, I'll leave that life to those
with the stomach for doubletalk
and hypocrisy, I think.

27:37.131 --> 27:39.129
Sir, could I have a moment?

27:39.131 --> 27:41.211
Of course.

27:44.411 --> 27:49.049
Well, if you ask ME, I think
you're all being very cynical.

27:49.051 --> 27:52.329
The wedding gift was a token
between equals, nothing more.

27:52.331 --> 27:54.569
I hope you manage more civility
when they come to visit.

27:54.571 --> 27:55.849
They're coming here?

27:55.851 --> 27:57.489
Is that such a surprise?

27:57.491 --> 28:00.049
I remember you saying
you couldn't stand Mrs Swanson.

28:00.051 --> 28:01.569
"Prudence."

28:01.571 --> 28:03.209
You said
her name said everything about her.

28:03.211 --> 28:04.969
You, miss,
should not be listening at keyholes.

28:04.971 --> 28:06.929
Ah, but you did say it.

28:06.931 --> 28:08.609
Oh, short but sweet.

28:08.611 --> 28:10.409
Grandmother's been caught out.

28:10.411 --> 28:11.491
George?

28:12.331 --> 28:14.849
Lord Gregory was found dead
this morning.

28:14.851 --> 28:16.569
Crazy Bill?
Oh, Anna.

28:16.571 --> 28:18.969
That's what people call him.
That's no excuse.

28:18.971 --> 28:20.531
He used to work for us.

28:22.571 --> 28:23.931
How did it happen?

28:25.051 --> 28:27.291
Uh, Norman didn't have the details.

28:31.771 --> 28:33.689
Such a terrible waste.

28:33.691 --> 28:36.009
I thought it best not to say
too much in front of James.

28:36.011 --> 28:37.929
I'll take him aside.

28:37.931 --> 28:39.969
Well, perhaps
seeing the hurt this causes

28:39.971 --> 28:43.049
will steer him away from any more
foolish thoughts of his own.

28:43.051 --> 28:44.929
Perhaps.

28:44.931 --> 28:46.929
Oh, Jack will take it very hard.

28:46.931 --> 28:48.411
He found the body, apparently.

28:50.011 --> 28:52.489
Will you order me the car,
please, George?

28:52.491 --> 28:54.691
Where are you going?
Now. Please.

28:58.891 --> 28:59.971
Sarah?

29:04.331 --> 29:06.251
Not quite.

29:07.331 --> 29:10.049
What are you doing here?

29:10.051 --> 29:11.891
Asking you the same question.

29:14.171 --> 29:16.131
Bill's body stunk of it.

29:17.531 --> 29:19.211
Four years and not a drop.

29:21.491 --> 29:22.891
Then this.

29:23.971 --> 29:25.171
Well, he gave up, Jack.

29:27.171 --> 29:28.889
I hope you haven't.

29:28.891 --> 29:30.411
Tell me you haven't.

29:32.411 --> 29:36.049
Came home from the institution
last time fixated on this ritual.

29:36.051 --> 29:37.171
We'd sit...

29:38.531 --> 29:40.051
every night,
the bottle between us.

29:42.331 --> 29:44.931
Bill wanted
to stare his demons in the eye.

29:45.971 --> 29:48.049
They finally consumed him.

29:48.051 --> 29:49.931
Only when I wasn't here.

29:52.491 --> 29:55.249
You want to walk that same road?

29:55.251 --> 29:57.771
I won't watch it.
So go!

29:59.131 --> 30:01.529
And let you sit
in a dead man's house,

30:01.531 --> 30:04.331
feeling guilty about something
you couldn't prevent?

30:05.691 --> 30:07.371
It was his ritual.

30:08.851 --> 30:10.291
The poor man is dead.

30:11.651 --> 30:13.331
You think we did this just for him?

30:14.331 --> 30:15.531
Huh?

30:17.491 --> 30:18.689
Jesus! You're bloody mad!

30:18.691 --> 30:20.649
I pulled you to your feet once.

30:20.651 --> 30:22.489
I literally dragged you
out of the gutter.

30:22.491 --> 30:26.489
And I am damned if I will let
self-pity pull you back down!

30:26.491 --> 30:28.411
You think that's what this is?
Then what is it?

30:36.811 --> 30:39.851
I saw what the war did to you.

30:41.571 --> 30:42.931
And I see you now.

30:45.171 --> 30:47.491
Go home
and you grieve your friend...

30:49.531 --> 30:51.331
like the man you are now...

30:53.411 --> 30:56.011
not the man I saved you from.

31:05.764 --> 31:08.764
We commend Bill Gregory to you,
Lord,

31:08.803 --> 31:11.401
though he strayed
far from the flock.

31:11.403 --> 31:16.241
We hope in your forgiveness
his sin can be overlooked

31:16.243 --> 31:19.643
and his soul come to rest at last.

31:20.963 --> 31:23.601
Almighty God, our Heavenly Father,

31:23.603 --> 31:27.321
you have given us hope
of the Resurrection to eternal life.

31:27.323 --> 31:31.083
In your keeping are all those
who have departed in Christ.

31:32.323 --> 31:35.321
We here commit the body
of our brother to the ground.

31:35.323 --> 31:38.983
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes,

31:39.056 --> 31:40.456
dust to dust.

31:43.496 --> 31:47.214
If looks could kill, they'd be
digging your grave right now.

31:47.216 --> 31:49.294
I assume
she was behind this happening.

31:49.296 --> 31:50.494
That's what they're saying.

31:50.496 --> 31:53.816
She really is
a study in contradictions.

31:55.016 --> 31:57.494
Very disappointing turnout,
Mrs Bligh.

31:57.496 --> 32:01.014
But understandable,
given how he died.

32:01.016 --> 32:03.494
It was very good of you to come,
Mrs Collins.

32:03.496 --> 32:05.294
Some may think differently

32:05.296 --> 32:08.494
but I believe what you did
was very fine indeed,

32:08.496 --> 32:10.414
seeing him buried
in hallowed ground.

32:10.416 --> 32:12.214
I don't understand.

32:12.216 --> 32:14.374
Wh... I'm sorry. I thought...

32:14.376 --> 32:16.576
We assumed...

32:19.936 --> 32:21.496
Perhaps not.

32:23.856 --> 32:24.936
Good day.

32:27.936 --> 32:29.574
I'm proud of you, Mother.

32:29.576 --> 32:31.934
I simply did what was required.

32:31.936 --> 32:34.854
The good reverend looked
as though he'd swallowed a lemon.

32:34.856 --> 32:38.414
Well, Bill Gregory
is properly at rest.

32:38.416 --> 32:40.294
That's what counts.
Yes.

32:40.296 --> 32:42.256
I'll meet you at the car.

32:43.376 --> 32:45.096
George.

32:46.136 --> 32:47.536
Sarah.

32:51.056 --> 32:52.214
How are you?

32:52.216 --> 32:54.054
Good, thank you.

32:54.056 --> 32:56.214
I hope you don't feel we've
put you out with the milk bottles.

32:56.216 --> 32:57.374
Not at all.

32:57.376 --> 32:58.696
I'm relieved to hear that.

33:00.016 --> 33:04.214
I hope my revelations the other day
didn't cause too many problems.

33:04.216 --> 33:05.214
No, quite the opposite.

33:05.216 --> 33:08.214
It seems to have
brought James and I closer.

33:08.216 --> 33:11.576
Well, that is good news -
on a day we could do with some.

33:13.776 --> 33:15.856
Well, I suppose I should be going.

33:17.376 --> 33:18.854
I suppose so.

33:18.856 --> 33:22.414
Now that you're settled,
I wonder if I might pay a visit.

33:22.416 --> 33:24.014
After all, you do have my dog,

33:24.016 --> 33:26.214
and I'd like to know
that he's recovering.

33:26.216 --> 33:29.854
Well, I'm sure Lucky would be
delighted to see you.

33:29.856 --> 33:31.376
At any time.

33:37.536 --> 33:40.496
I imagine the church building fund
is looking pretty healthy.

33:41.896 --> 33:44.734
Oh, let's just say the reverend
came to understand

33:44.736 --> 33:46.376
that Bill deserved no less.

33:47.376 --> 33:49.576
Considering what he sacrificed
for his country.

33:50.816 --> 33:52.254
And you?

33:52.256 --> 33:54.296
Fine.

33:55.736 --> 33:56.976
Sarah's been a help.

33:58.456 --> 34:02.976
Help, wherever it comes from,
has its value at times like this.

34:03.976 --> 34:05.896
I am here for you too.
You know that?

34:43.255 --> 34:44.536
Amen.
Amen.

34:49.696 --> 34:51.856
Good Shabbos.
Good Shabbos.

34:53.376 --> 34:55.295
Good Shabbos.
Lovely Shabbos.

34:56.176 --> 34:57.734
Here you are.

34:57.736 --> 34:59.936
Call if you need anything.

35:01.176 --> 35:02.374
Thank you, Aunty.

35:02.376 --> 35:04.534
Can we have a moment, please?

35:04.536 --> 35:05.936
Oh, of course.

35:10.696 --> 35:12.296
I brought you something.

35:15.256 --> 35:17.534
Don't worry - I asked your aunt.

35:17.536 --> 35:19.174
She said it was alright.

35:19.176 --> 35:20.976
It's beautiful.

35:23.256 --> 35:25.694
There's a thing called 'television'
in London now.

35:25.696 --> 35:27.534
It's like going to the pictures
at home.

35:27.536 --> 35:29.694
Soon you'll be able to
watch Marilyn from your bed.

35:29.696 --> 35:31.014
Won't that be something?

35:31.016 --> 35:33.094
But I like going to the pictures.

35:33.096 --> 35:35.576
Maybe when I'm better,
we can go together.

35:36.736 --> 35:38.336
I'd like nothing more.

35:41.456 --> 35:44.094
Make sure you come and say goodbye
before you leave.

35:44.096 --> 35:46.416
Even if I'm asleep, say goodnight.

35:47.736 --> 35:49.336
Of course I will.

35:50.536 --> 35:51.776
Promise.

35:57.536 --> 35:59.614
Leah's very special.

35:59.616 --> 36:01.174
Ja, she is.

36:01.176 --> 36:03.454
For years, she seemed so frail.

36:03.456 --> 36:05.416
Then the X-ray man came.

36:06.536 --> 36:08.094
The TB in her lungs.

36:08.096 --> 36:09.894
From her time in the cellar.

36:09.896 --> 36:13.374
She was hidden from the Nazis
for years.

36:13.376 --> 36:16.814
That suffering,
and still so optimistic.

36:16.816 --> 36:18.894
Her parents?
Taken.

36:18.896 --> 36:20.334
Gone.

36:20.336 --> 36:22.094
Hmm.

36:22.096 --> 36:24.376
Who can find the words?

36:26.656 --> 36:28.176
I know.

36:33.536 --> 36:38.016
But we assumed you... you were here
during the war, safe.
No.

36:40.096 --> 36:42.814
Well, we don't mean to bring up
any bad memories.

36:42.816 --> 36:44.056
Of course.

36:46.816 --> 36:48.656
I was in Ravensbruck.

36:48.753 --> 36:49.993
Two years.

36:53.153 --> 36:55.153
You survived.

36:58.433 --> 37:00.353
A part of me did.

37:06.831 --> 37:08.751
Oh, James,
I won't be joining you for dinner.

37:08.794 --> 37:11.154
If you could pass on my apologies.
Yes.

37:12.794 --> 37:14.514
Grandmother.

37:16.111 --> 37:18.189
I want you to know
that Bill Gregory's death

37:18.191 --> 37:19.471
has made its point with me.

37:20.431 --> 37:21.671
I don't want you worrying.

37:22.991 --> 37:24.111
Good.

37:24.991 --> 37:26.311
I'm glad.

37:28.431 --> 37:31.351
Because I wouldn't fight
for YOUR place in hallowed ground.

37:32.431 --> 37:34.951
Moral cowardice deserves no reward.

37:35.991 --> 37:38.069
Ah, George.
Where are you off to?

37:38.071 --> 37:39.269
Out.

37:39.271 --> 37:42.189
Oh, I had word
from Prudence Swanson.

37:42.191 --> 37:43.909
They'd love to visit.

37:43.911 --> 37:45.549
Just the two of them?

37:45.551 --> 37:48.349
She suggested they bring their son.

37:48.351 --> 37:49.951
How nice.

37:52.111 --> 37:53.189
Anna.

37:53.191 --> 37:55.231
Of course.

38:00.431 --> 38:01.871
Come in.

38:03.911 --> 38:04.909
Dinner?

38:04.911 --> 38:06.031
Soon.

38:09.791 --> 38:11.349
Anna...

38:11.351 --> 38:12.551
James.

38:17.431 --> 38:19.789
Always make your own decisions.
Do you hear me?

38:19.791 --> 38:21.349
What's going on?
Nothing.

38:21.351 --> 38:26.989
Just... if there's something that you
want, you really want, or... someone,

38:26.991 --> 38:28.269
be brave.

38:28.271 --> 38:30.189
Make your own decisions.

38:30.191 --> 38:31.349
Andrew Swanson?

38:31.351 --> 38:33.709
Who knows? Maybe he'll be a catch.

38:33.711 --> 38:35.349
But if not...
Don't worry.

38:35.351 --> 38:37.271
I won't do it.
Good.

38:38.471 --> 38:40.511
At least one of us
should have what they truly want.

38:42.151 --> 38:43.909
Didn't come out right.

38:43.911 --> 38:45.069
You know I'm mad for Livy.

38:45.071 --> 38:46.629
About Livy...

38:46.631 --> 38:48.189
Yes?

38:48.191 --> 38:50.429
Help her. This isn't easy.
I know that.

38:50.431 --> 38:52.789
You have told her everything?
Yes.

38:52.791 --> 38:54.951
Of course. We're fine.

38:55.791 --> 38:59.071
It might help if she could
put a face to whoever it was.

39:00.191 --> 39:02.269
I very much doubt that.

39:02.271 --> 39:04.189
Stay out of it.

39:04.191 --> 39:05.351
Please.

39:11.351 --> 39:13.551
Time to go down.
I'm almost ready.

39:18.431 --> 39:20.111
You been having
a sentimental moment?

39:21.191 --> 39:23.751
I was just looking through
our wedding photos.

39:26.631 --> 39:29.149
What are we having for dinner?

39:29.151 --> 39:31.911
I don't know. Lamb?

39:33.351 --> 39:35.869
I've eaten more sheep
since we arrived

39:35.871 --> 39:38.231
than I have in my entire life.

39:39.431 --> 39:44.229
I yearn for a plate
piled high with venison.

39:44.231 --> 39:46.271
Can you get venison in Australia?

39:52.591 --> 39:54.631
It was a wonderful day.

39:58.111 --> 39:59.831
Yes, it was.

40:01.391 --> 40:03.511
I'll see you downstairs, shall I?

40:05.031 --> 40:06.631
I won't be a moment.

40:40.231 --> 40:43.831
It's taken me eight years to
speak of the things I did tonight.

40:44.871 --> 40:48.791
And how do you explain to those
who can't even imagine such things?

40:50.111 --> 40:51.751
I've had the opportunity before.

40:52.871 --> 40:56.669
Strange. I'm not sure why
I finally felt able to.

40:56.671 --> 40:57.991
Time.

40:59.151 --> 41:00.469
Perhaps.

41:00.471 --> 41:02.231
Bashert?

41:03.391 --> 41:04.471
Fate.

41:07.951 --> 41:09.431
Belonging somewhere again.

41:11.031 --> 41:12.351
Thank you.

41:16.511 --> 41:17.591
Bye.

41:24.111 --> 41:25.871
It's rather late to be here,
isn't it?

41:27.951 --> 41:29.751
What can I do for you?

41:41.671 --> 41:44.511
If you ever need the ritual...

41:46.951 --> 41:48.231
you just ask.

41:53.311 --> 41:55.591
You never have to
face your demons alone.
