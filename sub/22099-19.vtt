TIGH: Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.

00:06.840 --> 00:09.759
ROSLIN: The Cylons have
established a human police force.

00:09.843 --> 00:14.180
Hundreds of us have been
rounded up by the Cylons,

00:14.264 --> 00:17.809
held in detention,
questioned, tortured.

00:18.394 --> 00:19.435
What's this?

00:19.520 --> 00:20.978
This orders
the summary executions

00:21.063 --> 00:22.897
of all the detainees
listed on the next page.

00:22.981 --> 00:25.108
It requires your signature.

00:25.943 --> 00:27.985
Sign it!
Sign your name!

00:36.203 --> 00:38.246
(GUNS FIRING)

00:38.956 --> 00:40.915
The Cylons knew exactly
where we were gonna be.

00:40.999 --> 00:42.250
I want to explain.

00:42.418 --> 00:43.793
SAM: She sold us out.

00:43.877 --> 00:46.212
You know what has
to be done here.

00:46.296 --> 00:48.464
Now, it would be better
for her sake if it was you.

00:48.549 --> 00:49.966
(CRYING)

00:50.551 --> 00:53.636
You're not afraid to represent
the most hated man alive?

00:53.721 --> 00:55.304
I'd like to see my client.

00:55.389 --> 00:57.390
If they want to kill me,
they'll find a way.

00:57.474 --> 00:58.516
No!

00:59.685 --> 01:02.270
With Baltar's lawyer injured,
his defense will need help.

01:02.354 --> 01:05.398
Dad, why not me? I'm close to
the case, I've read the documents.

01:05.482 --> 01:08.025
You're a CAG,
you're not a lawyer.

01:08.110 --> 01:11.070
I will not allow you
to sit across the courtroom

01:11.155 --> 01:14.031
on the other side,
defending Gaius Baltar.

01:14.116 --> 01:15.908
Is that an order?

01:15.993 --> 01:18.327
I'm through
giving you orders.

01:40.142 --> 01:41.851
(CHILD LAUGHING)

01:44.354 --> 01:45.480
Hera?

02:00.037 --> 02:01.162
(LAUGHING)
Hera!

02:10.964 --> 02:13.174
(LAUGHING)

02:38.116 --> 02:40.576
We finally got Greenleaf's
FTL nailed down, sir.

02:40.661 --> 02:41.828
So, fleet's ready
to jump again.

02:41.912 --> 02:44.705
How many more
before we find the nebula?

02:44.790 --> 02:48.793
I'm estimating an even dozen.
We're getting close.

02:48.877 --> 02:50.920
Still no sign of the Cylons?

02:51.004 --> 02:53.840
No, sir. We've left a trailing
bird in every jump site.

02:53.924 --> 02:56.759
No dradis contacts,
no sighting, nothing.

02:57.803 --> 03:00.388
Alter the mission orders
of the trailing Raptor.

03:00.472 --> 03:02.515
Tell them to remain
an additional six hours

03:02.599 --> 03:04.350
before catching up
with the fleet.

03:04.434 --> 03:05.601
Yes, sir.

03:06.270 --> 03:07.603
(STATIC BUZZING)

03:15.737 --> 03:17.655
(FAINT MELODY PLAYING)

03:20.075 --> 03:21.659
Yeah!

03:21.827 --> 03:23.244
(WHOOPING)

03:23.954 --> 03:25.913
You're up, superstar!

03:26.915 --> 03:29.750
You know this game's got frak-all
to do with the real thing, right?

03:29.835 --> 03:33.504
SKULLS: Yeah. I didn't hear you
nuggets say that at the beginning.

03:34.006 --> 03:35.756
(FAINT MELODY PLAYING)

03:37.593 --> 03:39.093
(STATIC BUZZING)

03:45.934 --> 03:47.560
I don't really care
what anybody...

03:47.644 --> 03:48.936
(FAINT MELODY PLAYING)

03:49.062 --> 03:50.438
There, go back,
you almost had it.

03:50.522 --> 03:52.064
SEELIX: Had what?

03:52.149 --> 03:54.650
That song.
You don't hear that song?

03:55.444 --> 03:57.862
No. Come on,
you're up, let's go.

03:59.531 --> 04:00.781
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:03.368 --> 04:06.829
Baltar was instrumental in the
Cylon attack on the Colonies.

04:06.914 --> 04:09.165
The President wants him
charged with genocide.

04:09.750 --> 04:12.585
I can't make it stick. There is
no evidence of his involvement...

04:12.669 --> 04:16.005
The President saw him with
one of the Sixes on Caprica,

04:16.089 --> 04:17.965
before the attacks.

04:19.509 --> 04:21.052
You really want me
to put Laura Roslin

04:21.136 --> 04:24.263
on the stand to testify about
her drug-induced visions?

04:24.348 --> 04:27.600
What we want is for you to
do your job and convict him.

04:27.684 --> 04:29.727
You can't do that,
we'll find someone who will.

04:29.811 --> 04:33.689
This a courtesy meeting,
not a strategy session.

04:33.774 --> 04:36.484
I am charging Baltar
with what I can prove.

04:36.568 --> 04:38.653
Of course, I do serve at
the pleasure of the President

04:38.737 --> 04:40.613
and if she decides
to replace me,

04:40.697 --> 04:43.699
I'm sure there are other lawyers
willing to take up the case.

04:45.327 --> 04:47.870
If there are
any other lawyers.

04:58.757 --> 05:00.091
Doctor Baltar?

05:07.099 --> 05:08.766
Who are you?

05:11.353 --> 05:12.478
Oh.

05:13.647 --> 05:16.691
Look, I'm terribly sorry, I'm under
strict instructions from my attorney

05:16.775 --> 05:19.318
not to speak to any
members of the press.

05:19.403 --> 05:21.112
No, Doctor Baltar, I...

05:21.196 --> 05:24.490
I want you to look
at this picture.

05:24.574 --> 05:26.158
This is my son.

05:26.243 --> 05:28.828
He's sick and I want
you to bless him.

05:28.912 --> 05:30.246
Bless him?

05:36.753 --> 05:37.837
Guard!

05:37.921 --> 05:40.006
Please! I'm terribly
sorry, but I can't help you.

05:40.090 --> 05:44.010
I'm not God, the God or a
god of any derivation thereof.

05:44.136 --> 05:46.012
Please, I... I can't
bless him, I'm sorry.

05:46.138 --> 05:48.514
I don't have any special
powers. I believe in you.

05:48.598 --> 05:50.224
That's very flattering.
What the hell's going on here?

05:50.350 --> 05:51.684
This place is
becoming like a zoo.

05:51.768 --> 05:53.853
(PLEADING) I'm on trial for my
life, I need a bit of privacy.

05:53.937 --> 05:55.688
Just pray for him, please.

05:56.773 --> 05:58.024
Please.
GUARD: Time to go.

05:58.108 --> 06:00.109
I'll do my best.
You can save him.

06:00.235 --> 06:02.611
Yeah, mind how you go, now.

06:17.461 --> 06:18.794
How many is that now?

06:20.172 --> 06:21.714
Five.

06:21.798 --> 06:24.967
Not including the 30 or 40
who've written letters.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.308
Well, I suppose
it can't be helped.

06:32.601 --> 06:34.977
Celebrity trials invariably
bring out the crazies.

06:36.855 --> 06:38.898
So you think
they're crazy?

06:40.859 --> 06:43.652
You see, I saw
a woman in pain.

06:44.821 --> 06:49.533
I saw a woman who can see you more
clearly than you can see yourself.

06:49.618 --> 06:52.995
Even if they kill you, your
name will live on forever.

07:11.139 --> 07:12.932
RACETRACK: Galactica,
Raptor 289.

07:13.016 --> 07:15.768
We're clear and in position
for rear guard picket.

07:15.852 --> 07:19.772
SKULLS: Roger, two-eight-niner.
Have fun watching our ass, Racetrack.

07:19.856 --> 07:22.274
Have fun watching
Baltar's ass get nailed.

07:40.293 --> 07:43.504
All right, get comfortable.
12 hours and counting.

07:44.089 --> 07:46.298
Twelve hours hanging out here
like bait on a hook,

07:46.383 --> 07:49.301
waiting to see if the Cylons
are still following us.

07:49.386 --> 07:51.554
Just shut up
and deal, okay?

07:57.978 --> 07:59.895
How do we measure loss?

08:06.403 --> 08:08.195
How do we measure loss?

08:13.577 --> 08:16.370
We measure it in the faces
of the dead,

08:16.454 --> 08:19.665
the faces that haunt
our memories and our dreams.

08:23.420 --> 08:25.337
How do we measure loss?

08:29.593 --> 08:31.844
We measure it
in our own faces,

08:32.429 --> 08:35.014
the ones we see
in the mirror every day

08:35.098 --> 08:37.433
because it has marked
each of us.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.561
So, how do we measure loss

08:41.688 --> 08:43.772
when the scale
of it becomes

08:44.524 --> 08:46.984
too hard to absorb
any other way?

08:47.068 --> 08:48.694
We use numbers.

08:48.778 --> 08:51.238
How many killed?
How many maimed?

08:52.115 --> 08:53.741
How many missing?

08:53.825 --> 08:56.869
And when those numbers
become too vast to comprehend,

08:56.953 --> 08:59.038
as they did two years ago,

08:59.998 --> 09:01.957
we had to turn it around.

09:03.460 --> 09:05.461
We began to count the living,

09:06.546 --> 09:08.422
those of us who survived

09:08.506 --> 09:11.383
to continue the saga
of the human race.

09:17.807 --> 09:20.309
44,035.

09:21.436 --> 09:24.772
The sum total of survivors
from the Twelve Colonies

09:24.856 --> 09:27.900
who settled on New Caprica
with President Gaius Baltar

09:27.984 --> 09:30.152
as their leader and protector.

09:32.864 --> 09:36.325
38,838.

09:38.286 --> 09:40.829
Our number the day
after we escaped.

09:43.625 --> 09:48.504
And the missing number, the
one that no one wants to face.

09:58.431 --> 10:01.892
5,197.

10:04.187 --> 10:09.191
5,197 of us

10:09.651 --> 10:13.821
killed, left behind
or simply disappeared.

10:14.823 --> 10:18.284
5,197

10:18.368 --> 10:22.538
of all that remains
of the human race,

10:22.622 --> 10:23.706
lost!

10:28.169 --> 10:29.962
The citizens
of the Twelve Colonies

10:30.046 --> 10:33.716
entrusted their fate and
their lives to Gaius Baltar.

10:33.800 --> 10:40.306
What we received was a reign of terror that
staggers our mind and breaks our hearts.

10:40.390 --> 10:42.975
Instead of governance,
we got tyranny.

10:43.560 --> 10:46.520
Instead of justice,
we got oppression.

10:46.604 --> 10:49.732
Instead of a president,
we got a murderer.

10:50.358 --> 10:53.736
Today, humanity holds him
accountable for his crime.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.826
Gaius Baltar
is not a victim.

11:02.120 --> 11:04.872
Gaius Baltar chose
to side with the Cylons

11:04.956 --> 11:08.417
and to actively seek the
deaths of his fellow citizens.

11:09.753 --> 11:11.170
For that...

11:12.297 --> 11:14.631
He must pay
the ultimate price.

11:25.727 --> 11:29.313
Your Honors, the defense would
like to change our plea to guilty.

11:29.481 --> 11:31.023
(PEOPLE MURMURING)

11:31.107 --> 11:32.274
What?

11:33.360 --> 11:35.277
Counselor, are you sure
you want to do that?

11:35.362 --> 11:38.614
No, but what
choice do I have?

11:38.698 --> 11:41.283
I mean, it's obvious
my client is guilty.

11:42.911 --> 11:45.079
He's a traitor and a killer.

11:45.914 --> 11:47.664
He's no better than the Cylon,
and what do we do with them?

11:47.749 --> 11:49.917
MAN: Throw them out the
airlock! That's right!

11:50.001 --> 11:51.794
Throw them out the airlock!

11:52.962 --> 11:55.839
This man sold us to our enemy.

11:56.883 --> 11:59.510
This man is our enemy.

11:59.594 --> 12:04.556
And if there's one thing that's good in
war, that is right and just and proper,

12:04.641 --> 12:06.809
it's slaughtering our enemy!

12:07.602 --> 12:10.145
Getting some
righteous payback!

12:14.818 --> 12:16.819
What are we waiting for?

12:17.362 --> 12:19.446
Let's just kill him now!

12:23.827 --> 12:25.994
It'd be easier,
wouldn't it?

12:28.248 --> 12:29.498
Simpler.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.001
Justice of the mob.

12:34.129 --> 12:35.838
It's what they want.

12:39.843 --> 12:41.385
Especially her.

12:44.347 --> 12:46.765
She's been wanting this
for over a year now.

12:46.850 --> 12:51.520
Ever since he beat her in a free
and fair election of the people.

12:53.022 --> 12:55.899
Now she gets a chance
to exact her revenge

12:55.984 --> 13:00.446
upon a man whose only real crime
is bowing to the inevitable.

13:01.364 --> 13:06.201
Gaius Baltar saved the lives
of the people on New Caprica,

13:06.286 --> 13:09.371
where Laura Roslin
would have seen us all dead,

13:10.039 --> 13:14.918
victims of a battle
we had no hope in winning.

13:17.881 --> 13:19.590
I don't know about you,

13:20.758 --> 13:25.262
but I'm glad she wasn't the president
when the Cylons arrived and said,

13:25.346 --> 13:27.097
"Surrender or die. "

13:28.725 --> 13:33.437
I owe my life to Gaius Baltar
and the decision he made that day.

13:35.565 --> 13:37.399
So does Laura Roslin.

13:44.908 --> 13:46.408
(WHISPERING)

13:50.914 --> 13:52.164
Yeah,
like you frakking know.

13:52.248 --> 13:54.583
I know you wank it
in your rack.

13:54.918 --> 13:56.293
Ladies' man...

13:56.377 --> 13:58.879
You see,
that's called self-healing.

13:59.923 --> 14:01.507
Okay, time check.

14:01.591 --> 14:03.550
(BEEPING)

14:03.801 --> 14:05.719
Oh, we got something.

14:05.803 --> 14:07.137
Lots of company.

14:09.390 --> 14:12.726
Reading three, four, no, five Baseships.
Crap! They're right on top of us.

14:12.810 --> 14:15.354
Frak. Frak! Incoming!

14:15.438 --> 14:16.855
The FTL's still spinning up.

14:16.940 --> 14:18.524
We've got to jump.

14:18.608 --> 14:20.442
Now, Gods damn it. Now!

14:21.277 --> 14:22.569
(BEEPING)

14:37.293 --> 14:40.546
Begin searching the entire
fleet for tracking devices.

14:40.630 --> 14:44.091
It's possible they could have
placed one on a ship on New Caprica.

14:46.886 --> 14:50.430
I think that we should ask the
Six. She may be willing to help.

14:50.515 --> 14:53.225
Baltar's girlfriend?
Why would she do that?

14:53.309 --> 14:56.853
Because she doesn't want to
see Hera go back to the Cylons.

14:56.938 --> 15:01.775
You think that thing would stick her
neck out for some half-Cylon whelp?

15:01.859 --> 15:04.861
I have a feeling she'd
lay her life down for it.

15:04.946 --> 15:06.321
A feeling?

15:08.825 --> 15:12.160
It's more than a feeling,
all right? Why... Just do it.

15:13.496 --> 15:14.997
It doesn't hurt to ask.

15:20.253 --> 15:21.378
No.

15:22.922 --> 15:27.009
Ask the prisoner if it knows of
any tracking devices in the fleet.

15:27.093 --> 15:28.635
With pleasure.

16:05.256 --> 16:06.548
(DOOR OPENING)

16:08.926 --> 16:12.471
The President, Gods bless
her sunny optimistic soul,

16:12.555 --> 16:16.767
thinks you might want to share how
your buddies have been tracking us.

16:17.143 --> 16:20.729
So I'm here to ask the question
and listen to your lies.

16:26.235 --> 16:29.363
In the last battle,
we discovered your fuel ship

16:30.156 --> 16:32.532
had a unique
radiation signature.

16:34.285 --> 16:36.912
They must have found
a way to track it.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.210
What else do you know?

16:44.253 --> 16:48.590
What other secrets are rattling
around inside that mechanical brain?

Don't be intimidated by him.

He's just using you
to exorcise his own pain.

close to him.

17:09.112 --> 17:12.739

want to know one thing I know?

17:14.200 --> 17:16.118
I know about your loss.

17:19.622 --> 17:21.289
It hurts, doesn't it?

17:22.291 --> 17:25.043

you can even survive it.

She was his world.

17:34.846 --> 17:37.806
Of course, he only
realized when she was gone.

17:38.141 --> 17:39.391
Did she know?

17:41.477 --> 17:43.061
Did she know?

17:44.230 --> 17:46.898
Did she know how much
she meant to you?

17:47.817 --> 17:50.819
Or did you wait to tell her
till she was gone?

17:51.654 --> 17:52.863
What?

17:53.322 --> 17:56.074
Bet you made her think
that she was a burden,

17:56.159 --> 17:58.410

What was the question again?

18:46.709 --> 18:51.588
As the leader of the insurgency,
did you ever hear of an instance

18:51.672 --> 18:53.757
in which Baltar
stood up to the Cylons

18:53.883 --> 18:56.468
or tried to disrupt their
plans? Oh, no, never.

18:56.552 --> 18:59.513
He never lifted a
frakking finger to help us.

of Baltar's Cylon allies.

19:21.285 --> 19:23.078

Thank you, Colonel.

19:33.798 --> 19:35.090
What happened
to the Colonel's wife?

19:35.174 --> 19:37.676
She used to work for one
of the Cylon administrators.

19:37.760 --> 19:39.344
She worked for him?

19:39.428 --> 19:40.512
You know what
happened to her?

19:40.596 --> 19:44.182
No, no idea. I presume she died
in the exodus from New Caprica.

Colonel.

19:54.902 --> 19:56.611
You dislike Gaius Baltar

19:56.696 --> 20:00.740
because you consider him to
be a traitor. Is that correct?

20:00.825 --> 20:03.577
And a coward
and a mass murderer.

Gaius Baltar was the
intended target, was he not?

And if he'd had the guts to show
up that day like he was supposed to,

20:15.214 --> 20:18.300
you and I wouldn't be having
this conversation right now.

the killing of...

to kill Gaius Baltar.

collaborated openly with the Cylons?

That she actually
worked for them?

She was faking it.

she was working for them.

he wasn't faking it, no?

She was giving
information to the Cylons.

A lot of good men died.

22:47.116 --> 22:49.951
She was my wife.
It was my responsibility.

22:52.496 --> 22:55.248
She did it for me.
That's what she said.

To save me from going back to prison
so they could tear more pieces off me.

23:00.755 --> 23:02.380
So I killed her.

23:05.009 --> 23:07.677
All because of that
thing over there.

23:08.888 --> 23:11.639
All because
Gaius frakking Baltar

didn't have the guts
to stand up to the Cylons.

23:15.019 --> 23:18.146

over to the Cylons,

claim to hold so dear, or second,

your only purpose here

is to jab your father
in the eye

We're too close to the nebula
to simply fix the problem

and hope the Cylons can't guess where
we're going. So, if we don't fix it,

off on a new course,

Is she okay?

30:33.081 --> 30:36.000
She looked a little rattled
in court yesterday.

30:38.837 --> 30:40.087
(SIGHS)

30:42.716 --> 30:45.635
We can't talk about
the trial outside of court.

30:45.719 --> 30:47.845
You know that,
or you should.

30:48.263 --> 30:49.514
I know.

30:50.599 --> 30:51.557
I wasn't asking about...

30:51.642 --> 30:53.059
After what you did to Tigh,

30:53.143 --> 30:56.521
you're the last person I
would consider to confide in.

30:57.356 --> 30:58.397
Me?

30:59.107 --> 31:00.900
I didn't do anything to Tigh.

31:00.984 --> 31:04.028
He was drunk.
It's really not my fault.

31:04.112 --> 31:06.948
You told Lampkin
about Ellen.

31:07.783 --> 31:09.992
I didn't even
know about Ellen.

31:10.994 --> 31:12.411
Yeah, right.

31:12.788 --> 31:14.664
You calling me a liar?

31:15.165 --> 31:17.667
I'm calling you a liar
and a coward.

31:18.210 --> 31:20.378
One who doesn't have the guts

31:20.462 --> 31:22.547
to go after a man himself.

31:24.424 --> 31:27.635
Instead, you hand
the shift to a stranger,

31:29.346 --> 31:31.764
and let him stab
Tigh in the back.

31:32.057 --> 31:33.558
And for what?

31:34.226 --> 31:37.270
That traitorous piece
of garbage Gaius Baltar.

31:38.313 --> 31:40.648
He doesn't even
deserve a trial.

31:43.193 --> 31:44.652
Are you done?

31:49.866 --> 31:50.950
Yes.

31:51.994 --> 31:53.619
Then so am I.

32:16.059 --> 32:19.937
I will not serve under a man
who questions my integrity.

32:21.648 --> 32:26.110
And I won't have an officer under
my command who doesn't have any.

32:35.203 --> 32:37.538
I'll see you
in court, Admiral.

32:56.266 --> 32:59.060
(CHATTERING)

33:00.354 --> 33:01.312
Let me do this.

33:01.396 --> 33:02.480
What?

33:03.148 --> 33:04.940
Are you sure, Major?

33:06.234 --> 33:09.403
It's mister now. And yeah,
I'm sure. It should be me.

33:09.488 --> 33:11.155
You're not seriously gonna
let my security guard...

33:11.239 --> 33:13.449
We're waiting,
Mr. Lampkin.

33:17.913 --> 33:21.666
If it please the court, my associate,
Mr. Adama, will question the witness.

33:22.834 --> 33:24.168
His associate.

33:25.420 --> 33:26.837
The defense may proceed.

33:26.922 --> 33:27.963
Thank you.

33:43.355 --> 33:46.732
Madam President, aren't you alive
today because of Gaius Baltar?

33:46.817 --> 33:51.320
I'm alive today because the insurgents
managed to stop the execution.

33:52.948 --> 33:56.033
Well, they saved you
from a Cylon firing squad,

33:57.077 --> 34:01.497
but wasn't it Baltar who saved your
life when you were dying from cancer?

34:01.581 --> 34:02.957
Relevance?

34:05.752 --> 34:07.336
Your Honors...

34:07.879 --> 34:10.297
Hostile witness,
Your Honors.

34:10.382 --> 34:13.634
If the court would grant us
just a little latitude.

34:13.885 --> 34:15.469
We'll allow it.

34:16.972 --> 34:18.347
Thank you. Um...

34:20.475 --> 34:23.936
Did Gaius Baltar save your life
when you were dying from cancer?

34:24.020 --> 34:27.815
Doctor Baltar's scientific
knowledge did save my life, indeed.

34:28.900 --> 34:32.611
Can you be more specific? How did
he save your life on that occasion?

34:32.696 --> 34:37.158
He injected me with the blood
of a half-Cylon, half-human baby.

34:39.661 --> 34:41.662
And your cancer vanished?

34:41.955 --> 34:43.289
Completely.

34:45.000 --> 34:48.544
During your illness, what
sort of medication were you on?

34:49.296 --> 34:51.756
You know, I was taking a lot
of medications at the time

34:51.840 --> 34:54.341
and I don't remember
all their names.

34:56.762 --> 34:59.638
Did you take something
called chamalla extract?

35:02.768 --> 35:03.976
Hmm.

35:05.479 --> 35:06.562
Yes.

35:06.688 --> 35:07.980
(PEOPLE MURMURING)

35:14.404 --> 35:18.282
Isnâ€™t it true that one of the
side effects of taking chamalla

35:18.366 --> 35:21.911
is a propensity
to experience hallucinations?

35:21.995 --> 35:25.539
Yes. That is one of the possible
side effects of chamalla.

35:25.624 --> 35:27.500
And isn't it also true

35:28.210 --> 35:32.171
that the visions that you
once described as messages

35:32.255 --> 35:35.382
from the Gods
were actually the result

35:35.467 --> 35:38.594
of a pharmacological reaction
from taking chamalla?

35:38.678 --> 35:40.805
The chamalla did enable me
to see certain things

35:40.889 --> 35:42.515
that were foretold
by the scriptures,

35:42.599 --> 35:45.851
things that will help this
fleet find its way to Earth.

35:45.936 --> 35:48.646
You, of all people, should
know that, Major. Your Honors.

35:48.730 --> 35:50.314
Mr. Adama, where are
you going with this?

35:50.398 --> 35:52.608
Just one more question,
Your Honor.

36:06.498 --> 36:10.292
(WHISPERING)
Please, don't do this. Please.

36:15.298 --> 36:18.717
Madam President, are you
taking chamalla at this time?

36:21.346 --> 36:23.597
Captain Apollo,
you remember that?

36:26.560 --> 36:28.686
I always thought
it had such a nice ring to it.

36:28.770 --> 36:31.564
I am so, so sorry
for you now.

36:39.281 --> 36:41.240
Chamalla, Madam President.

36:41.324 --> 36:44.702
Perhaps dissolved in your tea
to mask the bitterness.

36:45.245 --> 36:47.872
Don't answer. I'm putting
a stop to this, right now.

36:47.956 --> 36:51.041
Your Honors, if she is on drugs, it
goes to her credibility as a witness.

36:51.126 --> 36:52.793
Witness is dismissed.

36:52.878 --> 36:54.795
Your Honors,
I have to strongly object.

36:54.880 --> 36:56.589
He's obviously trying to
cover something up, here.

36:56.673 --> 36:59.633
One more word from you, and
you'll both be held for contempt.

36:59.718 --> 37:01.844
Admiral! I'd like to hear the witness

37:01.928 --> 37:04.221
answer the question.
As would I.

37:06.057 --> 37:09.143
Madam President, are you
taking chamalla again?

37:17.110 --> 37:18.485
Yes, I am.

37:18.820 --> 37:20.738
(MURMURING)

37:29.623 --> 37:31.415
No further questions.

37:32.292 --> 37:35.085
Mr. Adama, aren't you
going to ask me why?

37:36.463 --> 37:39.590
I'm sorry? Why am I
taking chamalla again?

37:41.801 --> 37:42.801
It's not strictly relevant.

37:42.886 --> 37:46.388
Well, perhaps it's not relevant
to you, but it's relevant to me.

37:49.267 --> 37:51.852
Go ahead. Ask me why.

37:53.813 --> 37:55.773
Finish what you started.

38:01.029 --> 38:04.490
Why are you talking the
chamalla again, Madam President?

38:09.037 --> 38:13.374
I am taking chamalla again
because my cancer has returned.

38:14.709 --> 38:16.085
(PEOPLE MURMURING)

38:37.899 --> 38:39.566
You know, the fact that
she's having hallucinations

38:39.651 --> 38:41.902
is relevant
to Baltar's defense.

38:43.071 --> 38:45.489
That's the way
the system works, Dee.

38:45.573 --> 38:48.826
The accused has a right to challenge
the credibility of witnesses against him.

38:48.910 --> 38:50.035
That's just the way it is.

38:50.120 --> 38:52.162
The system is broken, Lee.

38:52.831 --> 38:54.665
The system elected
that man to be president

38:54.749 --> 38:56.917
and the system is trying
to let him walk.

38:57.002 --> 38:58.961
That is not a system
that deserves to be defended.

38:59.045 --> 39:02.256
It deserves to be taken apart
and put back together again.

39:04.676 --> 39:06.427
You know, I wish...

39:12.934 --> 39:14.560
I wish I could
make you understand.

39:14.644 --> 39:16.603
I do understand, Lee.

39:16.980 --> 39:18.772
That's why I'm leaving.

39:20.567 --> 39:22.192
Well, you don't.

39:24.362 --> 39:26.113
You frakking don't.

39:37.876 --> 39:40.377
Madam President, how long have
you known about the cancer?

39:40.462 --> 39:41.545
About a week.

39:41.629 --> 39:43.380
And how advanced
is the disease?

39:43.465 --> 39:46.759
Will you be getting any more
transfusions from the half-Cylon donor?

39:46.843 --> 39:49.386
You know, this is the kind of
detail I'm not going to go into now.

39:49.471 --> 39:52.389
You know, we're looking at a game plan.
I'll let you know when we have one.

39:52.474 --> 39:55.726
Well, how the treatment for your
illness impact your duties as president?

39:55.810 --> 39:57.311
So far, it hasn't at all.

39:57.395 --> 39:59.146
Are you currently
taking chamalla extract?

39:59.230 --> 40:00.481
Don't answer that.

40:01.649 --> 40:03.734
How often
do you hallucinate?

40:03.818 --> 40:05.444
All right,
enough of this crap.

40:05.528 --> 40:06.862
We're done here.
Tory.

40:06.946 --> 40:08.906
You vultures can go
pick over another carcass.

40:08.990 --> 40:10.824
Tory! Come here.

40:11.743 --> 40:13.660
I'll see you inside.
Thank you.

40:20.460 --> 40:24.880
I'm sorry. Temperatures are running
a little high in the fleet these days.

40:25.090 --> 40:26.465
Who's next?

40:26.549 --> 40:27.591
Karen?

40:27.675 --> 40:30.677
Madam President,
how long do you have to live?

40:32.430 --> 40:35.015
How long do you
have to live, Karen?

40:46.111 --> 40:47.111
You handled that well.

40:47.195 --> 40:48.612
You didn't.

40:49.531 --> 40:51.782
"Picked over another carcass,"
as opposed to mine?

40:51.866 --> 40:54.451
That's gonna look
good in the press.

40:54.536 --> 40:56.787
I don't even know
why I said that. I...

40:56.871 --> 40:58.705
What is up with you?

40:58.790 --> 41:01.291
You've been off your game for days.

frankly, you're plain obnoxious.

41:04.212 --> 41:06.797
I just haven't been
sleeping very well.

You need to pull it together
and focus on your job, fast,

41:10.844 --> 41:12.219

41:12.303 --> 41:16.181

a comb through their hair once a week.

Pull it together.

41:53.553 --> 41:54.720
Right.

41:55.722 --> 41:57.431
So, we're using
the tylium ship as a decoy

41:57.515 --> 42:01.852
to lead the Cylons along this course,
here, almost directly opposite to ours.

42:01.936 --> 42:06.148
When they reach this point here,
they'll recalibrate the FTL,

42:06.232 --> 42:07.816
and start jumping back
to rendezvous with Galactica

42:07.901 --> 42:11.278
and the rest of the fleet,
here, at the lonian Nebula.

42:11.362 --> 42:13.488
Any indications the Cylons
are following them?

42:13.573 --> 42:17.367
Nothing yet. And it would appear
they've stopped following us as well.

42:17.452 --> 42:19.494
Our trailing Raptor has yet
to pick up any sign of pursuit

42:19.579 --> 42:22.122
since the tylium ship
left the fleet.

42:22.624 --> 42:25.167
How many jumps until
we reached the nebula?

42:25.251 --> 42:26.460
Uh...

we're down to the last three.

Is there anything
else, sir?

No, no. I was just...

back on Caprica

42:45.480 --> 42:48.273
when the weather was
about to change. You'd...

42:48.358 --> 42:50.692
You'd get this smell
in the air.

42:51.653 --> 42:54.780
I mean, the sun could be out,
not a cloud in the sky,

42:54.864 --> 42:57.866
but you'd pick up this smell
and you knew that

42:58.284 --> 43:00.535
something was just
over the horizon.
