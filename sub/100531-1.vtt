00:01.535 --> 00:02.468
(wind howls)

00:02.470 --> 00:06.305
(wolf howls)

00:12.480 --> 00:15.314
(dramatic music)

00:29.730 --> 00:34.800
(solemn music)
(child laughing)

01:04.131 --> 01:06.932
(child laughs)

01:15.476 --> 01:18.210
(swing squeaks)

01:37.631 --> 01:40.365
(swing squeaks)

02:01.822 --> 02:04.056
- Susie?

02:17.471 --> 02:21.206
(mysterious music)

02:21.208 --> 02:23.442
(beeping)

02:36.824 --> 02:40.058
- Her SaO2 is dropping,
it's a concern we have

02:40.060 --> 02:42.728
to watch closely now.

02:43.531 --> 02:46.198
(solemn music)

02:57.111 --> 03:00.546
As I'm sure you're aware,
today was Susie's last

03:00.548 --> 03:03.782
treatment, I was hoping
to give you good news

03:03.784 --> 03:05.551
but I also won't lead
you on pretending

03:05.553 --> 03:07.653
that I may know
answers that I do not.

03:08.756 --> 03:10.756
- So what are you
saying exactly?

03:11.859 --> 03:13.759
- With where Susie's
illness stands now

03:13.761 --> 03:16.061
and the rate at
which it's going,

03:16.063 --> 03:18.130
she has about eight
weeks left to live.

03:20.668 --> 03:23.902
- So what, there has to be
something we haven't tried--

03:23.904 --> 03:24.870
- Michael--
- We can do it.

03:24.872 --> 03:27.172
There has to be
something, right?

03:27.174 --> 03:30.309
She's three years old,
we cannot just give up.

03:30.311 --> 03:32.077
- Michael, we're not giving up.

03:32.079 --> 03:34.279
We've exhausted every
medical treatment

03:34.281 --> 03:36.215
we have in our
arsenal, everything.

03:38.152 --> 03:40.919
Medical miracles
can happen and have.

03:43.023 --> 03:45.324
- We're just supposed to
wait for a miracle then?

03:46.160 --> 03:48.060
- I'm saying continue
to love your child

03:48.062 --> 03:49.394
and fight along with her.

03:50.764 --> 03:52.231
I'm very sorry.

03:52.233 --> 03:54.866
(solemn music)

04:04.478 --> 04:08.447
(keyboard keys clack)
- Crenshaw's barely alive.

04:08.449 --> 04:09.781
(character screams)

04:09.783 --> 04:12.751
(mysterious music)

04:19.860 --> 04:21.793
- What are you doing?

04:24.832 --> 04:27.299
- I'm just looking at
alternative medicine.

04:30.271 --> 04:32.571
It seems we've been
through it all, you know?

04:35.009 --> 04:38.644
But we can't just stop
looking for something.

04:40.147 --> 04:42.848
I'm gonna go down to the
library tomorrow for awhile.

04:45.219 --> 04:47.085
- Do you,

04:47.087 --> 04:48.553
do you think there's hope?

04:49.823 --> 04:51.490
That we'll find a cure?

04:54.662 --> 04:55.560
- I don't know.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.931
But I'm gonna try
looking at case studies,

04:59.933 --> 05:03.669
unexplained illnesses,
whatever I can find.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.072
We'll figure this out.

05:10.277 --> 05:11.276
We have to.

05:13.047 --> 05:15.681
(somber music)

05:28.195 --> 05:31.263
(inquisitive music)

07:13.367 --> 07:16.168
(birds chirping)

07:17.371 --> 07:20.105
(tool clacking)

07:32.886 --> 07:35.620
(tool clacking)

07:39.626 --> 07:43.161
Hi, the Historian
Institute of Pennsylvania

07:43.163 --> 07:44.863
sent me to here.

07:44.865 --> 07:47.332
My name's Michael,
Michael Chancellor.

07:47.334 --> 07:49.968
Now I'm looking for
a Kane Galloway,

07:49.970 --> 07:51.703
is he here, available or?

07:51.705 --> 07:54.072
- You'll find him about
200 yards up that way.

07:55.275 --> 07:56.575
- All right, thank you.

08:01.081 --> 08:03.448
Hi, I'm looking for Kane,
can you help me out?

08:04.785 --> 08:07.285
- I'm Kane, is there
something I can help you with.

08:07.287 --> 08:09.454
- Yeah, the Institute
sent me here.

08:09.456 --> 08:12.157
I'm Michael Chancellor, they
said I'd find you here.

08:14.328 --> 08:17.362
I'm looking to hire you
to find something for me.

08:17.364 --> 08:20.499
It's a very specific
item that relatively

08:20.501 --> 08:22.100
impossible to locate.

08:22.102 --> 08:23.702
- What is it you're looking for?

08:25.272 --> 08:29.074
- My daughter, she's battling
a very serious illness.

08:29.076 --> 08:30.575
- So you're looking
for a doctor?

08:30.577 --> 08:32.511
- She's dying, Mr. Galloway.

08:33.881 --> 08:35.847
She's been through every
medical treatment possible

08:35.849 --> 08:37.282
and we're running out of options

08:37.284 --> 08:38.884
and there's very
little time left.

08:39.953 --> 08:42.320
I'm desperate for anything
and that's why I'm here.

08:43.123 --> 08:45.190
- What is it that
you're looking for?

08:45.192 --> 08:46.424
- Buddha's Tooth.

08:46.426 --> 08:47.392
- Buddha's Tooth?

08:48.462 --> 08:51.296
- It's said to have healing
powers to whoever holds it

08:51.298 --> 08:52.063
in their hand.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.332
It's our last hope.

08:55.602 --> 08:57.202
I don't know where else to turn

08:58.272 --> 09:01.406
and I'm begging
you, please, please.

09:04.278 --> 09:07.579
- Buddha's Tooth is a myth,
you need a mythologist

09:07.581 --> 09:10.048
and I locate relics,
Mr. Chancellor.

09:11.285 --> 09:14.252
- I don't understand,
so you're saying--

09:14.254 --> 09:17.789
- I'm saying Buddha's
Tooth is a myth, not real.

09:17.791 --> 09:19.024
And I deal in reality.

09:20.327 --> 09:22.093
- So you're saying
you won't help.

09:24.264 --> 09:27.766
- I'm saying you're chasing
a ghost, Mr. Chancellor.

09:27.768 --> 09:29.834
It's a waste of
time and efforts.

09:29.836 --> 09:32.571
Now if you'll excuse me,
I've got a deadline to meet.

09:34.741 --> 09:36.074
- It's our last hope.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.146
- I'm sorry to hear
about your child.

09:53.226 --> 09:55.160
- Kane?
- Yeah.

09:55.162 --> 09:56.394
- He left this for you.

10:06.873 --> 10:09.608
(ominous music)

10:20.887 --> 10:22.854
- What ya think, Dad?

10:35.435 --> 10:37.902
(knocking on door)

10:37.904 --> 10:39.337
- I'll get it.

10:47.381 --> 10:50.815
(mysterious music)

10:50.817 --> 10:52.050
Not gonna lie to you,

10:52.052 --> 10:56.621
I've read a lot of strange
stories regarding the Tooth.

10:56.623 --> 10:59.591
Stories about it being
protected by gatekeepers.

11:00.994 --> 11:03.895
Things that are just too
impossible to be true.

11:05.866 --> 11:08.900
But, on the chance that
it would heal my daughter,

11:10.737 --> 11:12.437
they have to have a price.

11:13.974 --> 11:17.042
All of those are blank
to cover your expenses

11:17.044 --> 11:18.410
and for acquiring the Tooth.

11:19.613 --> 11:21.413
What do you feel
our first move is?

11:22.482 --> 11:24.416
- It has been said
that the Tooth travels

11:24.418 --> 11:26.051
around between multiple keepers.

11:27.154 --> 11:29.688
It never stays in one
place for very long.

11:29.690 --> 11:32.824
My first move, I'm gonna
pay a visit to someone

11:32.826 --> 11:33.591
I think can help.

11:35.462 --> 11:38.263
(peaceful music)

11:50.444 --> 11:51.943
It's good to see you, Master.

11:58.018 --> 12:00.418
- I see you have kept
up with your training.

12:00.420 --> 12:02.454
- Did you think I wouldn't?

12:02.455 --> 12:04.489
- You still have much to learn,
Kane, there is no ending.

12:05.592 --> 12:07.692
It has been years
since you were here.

12:07.694 --> 12:09.728
I gather that you are
not here to train.

12:09.730 --> 12:11.362
- I apologize for
my work consuming

12:11.364 --> 12:13.665
my last three years, but
yeah, I came to ask you

12:13.667 --> 12:14.866
for help finding a relic.

12:16.036 --> 12:18.770
- Oh, what is this you seek?

12:18.772 --> 12:20.505
- Buddha's Tooth.

12:20.507 --> 12:24.209
- Ah, Cane, Buddha's Tooth
is heavily protected.

12:24.211 --> 12:28.546
Very secretly hidden, that
Tooth is not to be just given.

12:28.548 --> 12:31.049
- I'm not looking for it
to be given, I'm taking it.

12:31.051 --> 12:33.685
Taking it back to
the States with me.

12:33.687 --> 12:36.187
- Kane, tooth is
not for the taking.

12:36.189 --> 12:38.890
Why do you seek
this now, my son?

12:38.892 --> 12:40.592
- It's not for me.

12:40.594 --> 12:43.661
A young child's very sick,
her family came to me for help

12:43.663 --> 12:46.464
finding this item and then
bringing it back to them.

12:46.466 --> 12:48.433
The Tooth is said to
have healing powers.

12:48.435 --> 12:51.102
- Yes, that is a legend.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.154
- Can you help me?

12:53.155 --> 12:55.205
- You will need transportation
all over the world.

12:56.343 --> 12:58.176
Let me pay a visit
to an old friend

12:58.178 --> 13:01.913
who owes me a large
favor but know this,

13:01.915 --> 13:05.850
to get Buddha's Tooth,
you'll need to become legend.

13:07.120 --> 13:10.021
(easygoing music)

13:14.094 --> 13:17.262
(patrons chattering)

13:34.181 --> 13:35.313
I'm looking for Ruby.

13:40.554 --> 13:42.554
- Help you find
something, old man?

13:42.556 --> 13:43.655
Maybe the potty?

13:45.292 --> 13:46.558
- I'm looking for Ruby.

13:46.560 --> 13:48.660
- Well she aint' here and
you better get out of here

13:48.662 --> 13:49.727
before you get hurt.

13:51.431 --> 13:54.232
(flesh thudding)

14:07.013 --> 14:12.083
(flesh thudding)
(man groans)

14:13.086 --> 14:18.156
(man shouts)
(man grunting)

14:21.795 --> 14:26.865
(wrist snapping)
(men shouting)

14:31.204 --> 14:33.671
(Ruby claps)

14:39.246 --> 14:44.315
- Sang-Jin, here I
thought you were dead.

14:44.818 --> 14:45.717
- Ask your friends.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.055
- Come for a drink?

14:52.192 --> 14:54.192
- I came to collect
a favor you owe me.

14:55.128 --> 14:56.594
- It's on me, my old friend.

14:59.132 --> 15:00.064
I'm a busy girl.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.701
My import export business
is booming, my friend.

15:04.804 --> 15:06.838
- Precisely why I
come to you now.

15:06.840 --> 15:07.839
- Oh?

15:07.841 --> 15:09.474
- International transportation.

15:10.510 --> 15:12.610
You have your own
private plane, I assume.

15:16.950 --> 15:18.616
I'm proud of you, Kane.

15:18.618 --> 15:20.351
The knowledge you
have gained here,

15:20.353 --> 15:22.053
certainly did not go to waste.

15:22.055 --> 15:25.189
Perhaps, mentally, even
more than physically,

15:25.191 --> 15:28.526
your honor, most noble
mission here, Kane,

15:28.528 --> 15:30.862
but understand the dangers.

15:31.765 --> 15:33.264
- Dangers?

15:33.266 --> 15:35.833
- [Sang-Jin] Your life will
be in great danger throughout.

15:35.835 --> 15:39.871
Many have met their demise
seeking the Tooth's powers.

15:41.041 --> 15:43.641
The gatekeepers are
there to see its powers

15:43.643 --> 15:45.944
do not fall into
the wrong hands.

15:45.946 --> 15:48.146
- Mine aren't the
wrong hands, Master.

15:48.148 --> 15:50.448
- I understand,
but they will not.

15:51.785 --> 15:54.585
This map will put you
to one gatekeeper.

15:55.689 --> 15:58.523
Upon defeating him,
there'll be clues

15:58.525 --> 15:59.624
to the next gatekeeper.

16:00.427 --> 16:02.694
There are five gatekeepers.

16:03.797 --> 16:06.597
That is your gaunt list
to achieve the Tooth.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.000
- [Kane] Thank you, Master.

16:09.803 --> 16:12.170
- [Sang-Jin] I wish you success.

16:12.172 --> 16:13.104
Just know.

16:14.107 --> 16:15.974
- [Kane] Know what, Master?

16:15.976 --> 16:18.009
- [Sang-Jin] Not
achieving the Tooth

16:18.011 --> 16:22.647
means you have died at the
hands of the gatekeepers.

16:23.717 --> 16:26.851
(motorcycle rumbles)

17:04.024 --> 17:05.056
- You must be Ruby.

17:07.460 --> 17:09.594
- Sang-Jin speaks
very highly of you.

17:10.897 --> 17:11.763
- Good to know.

17:17.270 --> 17:19.971
- There's something
else good to know.

17:19.973 --> 17:23.007
He's the only reason
you're here right now.

17:23.009 --> 17:25.576
Not exactly running
official business.

17:25.578 --> 17:28.513
Everything under the radar
and not only does it need

17:28.515 --> 17:29.347
to stay that way,

17:30.717 --> 17:32.483
I like it that way.

17:32.485 --> 17:35.019
You do anything
to compromise me,

17:35.021 --> 17:37.955
you do anything to
compromise my business.

17:40.460 --> 17:41.359
Just don't.

17:42.462 --> 17:44.228
- I'm not here to make
your life difficult,

17:44.230 --> 17:46.964
just need transportation fast.

17:46.966 --> 17:47.865
That's it.

17:49.302 --> 17:50.435
- That I can do.

17:51.504 --> 17:54.906
Load your bags, I
don't caddy to anyone.

17:54.908 --> 17:56.507
- [Kane] Hey.

17:56.509 --> 17:58.342
You know there is
something I do know.

17:59.479 --> 18:02.180
I heard that even doing
this favor for Sang-Jin

18:02.182 --> 18:04.582
that you'd still owe him
a thousand times over.

18:12.692 --> 18:15.526
(dramatic music)

20:01.000 --> 20:03.734
(water rushing)

20:21.588 --> 20:24.655
(suspenseful music)

20:47.180 --> 20:51.249
(gate keeper speaks
in foreign language)

20:51.251 --> 20:53.117
(Kane speaks in
foreign language)

20:53.119 --> 20:56.120
- (speaks in foreign
language) I speak the English.

20:56.122 --> 20:57.655
Can I help you with something?

20:59.058 --> 20:59.924
- I think so.

21:02.962 --> 21:05.930
- Mm, American, yes?

21:07.467 --> 21:11.168
You come long way to visit
lonely cabin in woods.

21:12.705 --> 21:16.274
Come, let us let Mother
Nature be and take shelter.

21:23.149 --> 21:25.583
Please, your name.

21:27.253 --> 21:28.119
- [Kane] Kane.

21:29.756 --> 21:32.456
- It mean little fighter, yes?

21:36.562 --> 21:37.762
Please, sit.

21:46.205 --> 21:47.071
Here.

21:49.542 --> 21:51.442
It will help take
sting out of cold.

21:57.617 --> 21:58.482
Hm.

22:02.288 --> 22:04.989
Toast to your travels, Mr. Kane.

22:15.835 --> 22:20.237
Mr. Lo Chen, wonderful man.

22:20.239 --> 22:24.575
Years ago when Russia and
China have good relations.

22:25.845 --> 22:30.514
Give me opportunity to train
with the best of the best.

22:33.353 --> 22:37.154
Train hard, train often,
Master Wu would say (chuckles).

22:37.924 --> 22:39.390
Develops character.

22:41.060 --> 22:44.962
Yes, he was right,
he was always right.

22:46.632 --> 22:47.698
Good times.

22:49.502 --> 22:51.035
To Master Lo Chen.

22:56.209 --> 22:58.342
So comrade, tell me.

22:59.512 --> 23:01.278
Brings you all the way out here?

23:03.383 --> 23:04.281
- A young girl.

23:06.719 --> 23:07.618
- Go on.

23:09.155 --> 23:12.623
- I'm seeking a powerful
relic, one that could heal her.

23:13.893 --> 23:16.093
(man sighs)

23:16.095 --> 23:16.994
- I see.

23:19.799 --> 23:22.533
(ominous music)

23:34.947 --> 23:39.116
The Buddha's Tooth,
an item of much power.

23:42.655 --> 23:45.890
Many have come before
you, seeking for it.

23:47.627 --> 23:48.826
Let's just say,

23:50.029 --> 23:51.328
they never left.

23:53.533 --> 23:57.234
I admit your cause is
more noble than theirs.

24:00.239 --> 24:01.138
But,

24:02.475 --> 24:04.809
I believe death

24:05.611 --> 24:07.478
is this child's destiny.

24:09.115 --> 24:10.881
A Tooth cannot stop destiny.

24:12.952 --> 24:14.552
- Maybe for this child it can.

24:16.155 --> 24:19.123
(gatekeeper sighs)

24:19.125 --> 24:22.359
- If I could help, I would.

24:25.498 --> 24:29.467
But I have been sworn
to protect this relic.

24:33.506 --> 24:36.974
And if you use
it, it could have,

24:38.778 --> 24:39.743
how you say,

24:41.747 --> 24:43.414
effect of butterfly.

24:45.351 --> 24:46.784
It's very dangerous.

24:50.790 --> 24:54.825
Who a, I to choose who
benefits from its power.

24:56.996 --> 24:58.295
Who lives, who dies.

24:59.565 --> 25:00.531
Yet--

25:00.533 --> 25:02.366
- I'm not asking you to choose.

25:02.368 --> 25:03.567
I'm asking you to help.

25:04.637 --> 25:06.136
Maybe it can't save everyone,

25:07.473 --> 25:09.974
but if it can help one child
live to their potential,

25:11.143 --> 25:12.610
isn't that enough?

25:12.612 --> 25:16.113
- I understand your
sentiment, my friend.

25:20.386 --> 25:22.353
But I must disagree.

25:26.359 --> 25:27.625
You should leave.

25:30.263 --> 25:31.762
- I'm not leaving without it.

25:33.799 --> 25:36.767
(gatekeeper sighs)

25:42.341 --> 25:45.576
- Then perhaps, you
don't leave at all.

25:50.049 --> 25:52.683
(men grunting)

25:54.520 --> 25:57.321
(flesh thudding)

26:03.729 --> 26:06.697
(bottles clinking)

26:12.405 --> 26:15.205
(wrist snapping)

26:17.977 --> 26:23.047
(pan clunks)
(gatekeeper grunts)

26:24.984 --> 26:28.152
(gatekeeper screams)

26:29.388 --> 26:32.222
(glass clinking)

26:46.405 --> 26:49.440
Believe this is what you're
looking for, comrade.

26:54.213 --> 26:59.249
(men grunting)
(flesh thudding)

27:08.594 --> 27:13.664
(men grunting)
(objects clunking)

27:13.666 --> 27:18.535
(pan clinks)
(gatekeeper screams)

27:18.537 --> 27:21.605
(gatekeeper groans)

27:23.376 --> 27:26.110
(ominous music)

27:40.993 --> 27:42.126
(gatekeeper shouts)

27:42.128 --> 27:46.897
(pan clunks)
(gatekeeper groans)

27:49.235 --> 27:51.735
(pan clunks)

27:54.407 --> 27:57.141
(ominous music)

28:21.967 --> 28:24.401
(phone buzzing)

28:24.403 --> 28:26.370
- Site 7E.

28:26.372 --> 28:27.871
- Douglas, it's Kane.

28:27.873 --> 28:29.807
- Kane, where are you?

28:29.809 --> 28:32.176
- Listen, I'm gonna be
away for a few weeks.

28:32.178 --> 28:34.144
I need you to take the
lead while I'm gone.

28:34.146 --> 28:37.014
- I can't keep the foundation
away from here forever.

28:37.016 --> 28:40.350
- Yes, yes, you can,
Douglas, I need you.

28:41.787 --> 28:42.953
I'll be in touch.

28:42.955 --> 28:44.588
- Kane, hello?

28:49.195 --> 28:52.496
(plane blade whirring)

28:53.999 --> 28:56.934
- You get what you're
looking for, chief?

28:56.936 --> 28:59.369
- Not yet, it's a
work in progress.

29:00.573 --> 29:04.041
- Yeah, well, hopefully
we're not just wasting

29:04.043 --> 29:04.675
time and fuel.

29:07.012 --> 29:08.445
- How do you know Sang-Jin?

29:10.416 --> 29:13.684
- You mean how does someone
like me know Sang-Jin?

29:14.687 --> 29:16.920
- I didn't mean anything,
I was just curious

29:16.922 --> 29:19.623
how the two of you
would've crossed paths.

29:19.625 --> 29:22.760
- I was in the right
place at the right time.

29:26.866 --> 29:30.000
Relax, he's still
who you think he is.

29:31.370 --> 29:32.770
- I would never doubt that.

29:35.174 --> 29:36.707
- I was at a Chinese market.

29:37.843 --> 29:39.676
Some punks cornered me
and tried to knife me

29:39.678 --> 29:41.678
over 15 American dollars.

29:42.648 --> 29:45.816
And there he was,
just like a superhero.

29:48.287 --> 29:50.854
Needless to say, they
didn't get my $15.

29:52.158 --> 29:53.123
Just the hospital.

29:55.561 --> 29:57.561
- Well I'm glad
you're still here.

29:57.563 --> 29:58.462
- For you?

29:59.899 --> 30:00.798
- For you.

30:02.668 --> 30:04.134
- He saved my life that day.

30:05.971 --> 30:07.638
We kept in touch here and there.

30:09.108 --> 30:11.842
He disapproved of my
business, that I know.

30:12.745 --> 30:14.077
- Why?

30:14.079 --> 30:16.280
- Hm, probably thought
I was running drugs.

30:18.050 --> 30:19.383
Which I don't.

30:23.455 --> 30:24.588
- So what do you run?

30:25.925 --> 30:28.125
- Everything else.

30:29.128 --> 30:31.962
(dramatic music)

30:51.617 --> 30:54.318
(water rushing)

31:14.773 --> 31:17.074
(clunking)

31:21.046 --> 31:24.181
(animals chittering)

31:44.703 --> 31:46.770
- Whatever it is you seek,

31:46.772 --> 31:48.605
you will not find
it here, American.

31:54.179 --> 31:55.679
Nothing more needs said.

31:57.750 --> 32:00.384
(intense music)

32:11.030 --> 32:13.830
(flesh thudding)

32:21.206 --> 32:24.041
(flesh thudding)

32:52.171 --> 32:54.705
(Kane coughs)

33:02.247 --> 33:05.082
(flesh thudding)

33:20.666 --> 33:23.500
(dramatic music)

33:29.375 --> 33:32.175
(heart pounding)

33:58.337 --> 34:00.971
(water rushing)

34:19.124 --> 34:22.192
(suspenseful music)

34:24.263 --> 34:26.830
(Kane grunts)

34:34.239 --> 34:37.074
(flesh thudding)

34:49.655 --> 34:52.556
(Kane blubbering)

35:14.146 --> 35:15.645
- The map, where?

35:29.862 --> 35:32.696
(animals chittering)

35:32.698 --> 35:35.265
(tense music)

35:55.821 --> 35:59.389
(plane propellor whirring)

36:00.959 --> 36:03.760
Yeah, I'm off to Japan,
I'll get there late tonight.

36:03.762 --> 36:05.996
- Susie's stable for right now.

36:05.998 --> 36:09.866
She just saw her doctor,
he said nothing's changed.

36:09.868 --> 36:11.234
For better or for worse.

36:12.104 --> 36:13.637
- I'll be in touch shortly.

36:13.639 --> 36:15.105
- What can I do to help?

36:15.107 --> 36:16.439
- Stay positive.

36:16.441 --> 36:17.908
- That's not what I meant.

36:17.910 --> 36:19.543
- I know but that's what
I need from you the most.

36:19.545 --> 36:21.044
That's what she needs
from you the most.

36:21.046 --> 36:22.546
I'll talk to you soon.

36:22.548 --> 36:23.680
- Kane.

36:23.682 --> 36:24.514
- Yeah?

36:24.516 --> 36:25.549
- Please hurry.

36:27.252 --> 36:28.151
Please.

36:38.063 --> 36:39.229
- What now?

36:39.231 --> 36:40.697
- We have to hurry.

36:40.699 --> 36:43.466
- Looking at the coordinates,
if we hit the jet stream

36:43.468 --> 36:45.602
just right, we'll be able
to cut our travel time

36:45.604 --> 36:47.971
by a third and save
on a lot of fuel.

36:47.973 --> 36:49.673
- When can we leave?

36:49.675 --> 36:51.074
- Now.

36:51.076 --> 36:53.877
(dramatic music)

38:17.596 --> 38:20.463
- You're gaining
quite the reputation

38:21.566 --> 38:23.333
and quickly, American.

38:24.136 --> 38:28.672
Please, sit, relax.

38:28.674 --> 38:31.508
(bird squawking)

38:36.348 --> 38:37.247
Your name?

38:38.417 --> 38:39.816
- Kane.

38:39.818 --> 38:42.085
- Ah, the little fighter.

38:43.689 --> 38:45.689
An appropriate
name it would seem.

38:46.925 --> 38:50.126
Did your mother speak
of your name's meaning?

38:51.897 --> 38:53.730
- I wouldn't know.
- Oh?

38:54.933 --> 38:57.000
- My mother died giving birth.

38:57.002 --> 39:01.805
- To you, a little fighter,
in more ways than one.

39:06.912 --> 39:09.412
You come seeking the Tooth, yes?

39:09.414 --> 39:12.615
It has been some time
since a challenger came.

39:13.785 --> 39:16.720
Individuals that make
it here for the Tooth,

39:17.789 --> 39:19.689
do not leave.

39:19.691 --> 39:22.192
I sense you have a
vulnerable reason

39:22.194 --> 39:24.894
for wanting such
a powerful item.

39:24.896 --> 39:27.063
I sense it strongly with you.

39:28.633 --> 39:33.069
While I do not know you,
there's an ancient Japanese

39:33.071 --> 39:35.038
saying I will share.

39:35.040 --> 39:38.375
When the character of
a man is not clear,

39:38.377 --> 39:40.443
look at his friends.

39:42.848 --> 39:44.114
- My master is Sang-Jin.

39:49.087 --> 39:50.854
- You must be hungry.

39:50.856 --> 39:53.423
(tense music)

40:32.097 --> 40:34.831
Sang-Jin, a true legend.

40:35.934 --> 40:38.735
Please tell me how
you come to know him.

40:39.838 --> 40:41.704
- I was born in China,
my father traveled

40:41.706 --> 40:43.506
all over the world for his work.

40:43.508 --> 40:45.875
Yet, wasn't ready
to be a father.

40:45.877 --> 40:47.977
Sang-Jin took me
in as an infant.

40:47.979 --> 40:51.681
His generosity, compassion,
the life lessons he taught me,

40:51.683 --> 40:54.984
I could never repay, only honor.

40:54.986 --> 41:00.890
- So you know not your
(speaks in foreign language)?

41:00.892 --> 41:04.461
(speaks in foreign language)

41:04.463 --> 41:05.361
- Well...

41:08.633 --> 41:09.699
To Sang-Jin.

41:15.740 --> 41:18.808
You do not enjoy
a fine wine, Kane?

41:18.810 --> 41:22.745
- Sensai, I don't need
served, please allow one

41:22.747 --> 41:24.214
of the ladies to enjoy my drink.

41:24.216 --> 41:27.183
(mysterious music)

41:38.263 --> 41:40.763
(woman gags)

41:49.508 --> 41:51.908
- I underestimate
you, little fighter.

41:52.744 --> 41:55.678
Sang-Jin has taught you well.

41:55.680 --> 41:59.616
- Shinobis are mercenaries,
not known for a code of honor.

41:59.618 --> 42:01.384
- That is true.

42:01.386 --> 42:04.787
Deception, an assassin's
best of friend.

42:06.358 --> 42:09.492
It seems our paths were
destined for physical combat.

42:11.096 --> 42:14.864
But my time of underestimating
you is now over.

42:16.134 --> 42:17.166
- No doubt.

42:17.168 --> 42:19.068
- Sang-Jin will be very proud.

42:20.438 --> 42:24.040
It is getting late, let
us retire for the evening.

42:25.343 --> 42:28.611
Servant Nisaki will show
you to your chambers.

42:29.748 --> 42:32.215
She will make you
very comfortable.

42:33.485 --> 42:35.485
She is at your command.

42:36.588 --> 42:40.189
We shall meet at sunrise
on the north premise.

42:40.191 --> 42:42.825
Nisaki will see
to it you arrive.

42:46.197 --> 42:47.730
- Enjoy your evening, Sensai.

42:49.367 --> 42:53.369
- Before your retire, your meal,

42:53.371 --> 42:55.338
though it was cooked
to perfection,

42:56.308 --> 42:58.107
what did you add to it?

42:58.109 --> 43:02.545
- A spice mixture, cinnamon,
dried plums, garlic,

43:03.648 --> 43:07.650
it's used to eliminate
bacteria or toxins.

43:11.356 --> 43:14.357
(mysterious music)

44:28.833 --> 44:31.501
(solemn music)

44:47.886 --> 44:50.720
- A valerian tea
before bed, Master?

44:50.722 --> 44:51.621
- No thank you.

44:55.493 --> 44:58.161
- It will help you relax
before a challenging day.

44:58.163 --> 44:59.028
- No thank you.

44:59.864 --> 45:00.763
- I understand.

45:05.770 --> 45:07.904
What can I do for you?

45:07.906 --> 45:10.807
A massage perhaps,
something else?

45:13.144 --> 45:14.644
- Let's just get some rest.

45:57.355 --> 46:00.890
- Your journey ends 200
kilometers to the north.

46:00.892 --> 46:03.059
It was an honor to
meet you, Master.

46:04.996 --> 46:07.563
(tense music)

46:35.827 --> 46:39.996
- To see you end today, I
feel the universe will suffer

46:39.998 --> 46:41.030
with your loss.

46:42.100 --> 46:45.601
Let's hope the next
individual seeking death

46:45.603 --> 46:48.204
will think more
clearly than you.

46:53.545 --> 46:56.379
(dramatic music)

46:58.883 --> 47:00.149
(gatekeeper shouts)

47:00.151 --> 47:02.785
(swords clank)

47:06.224 --> 47:09.292
(fighters grunting)

48:21.966 --> 48:22.865
- Where?

48:30.842 --> 48:33.409
(tense music)

48:51.930 --> 48:54.764
(waves crashing)

49:27.365 --> 49:30.032
(somber music)

49:44.649 --> 49:46.682
- Be ready to fly
out in about an hour.

49:48.086 --> 49:48.985
- Great.

49:51.089 --> 49:52.989
- I never ask people anything.

49:54.158 --> 49:57.893
I tell them, but that's
my life and just the way

49:57.895 --> 50:01.097
things work for me but I
have to ask you something.

50:02.800 --> 50:04.200
Why are you doing this?

50:06.104 --> 50:07.770
- I wasn't gonna do it at first.

50:07.772 --> 50:12.708
The relic I'm after, the
Buddha's Tooth, it's a myth.

50:14.278 --> 50:16.212
The little girl's family
obviously was desperate

50:16.214 --> 50:17.847
when they came to me and
when you're desperate

50:17.849 --> 50:21.217
you can believe or want
to believe crazy things.

50:22.120 --> 50:23.419
- What changed your mind?

50:25.990 --> 50:27.723
- They could've went about
it several different ways

50:27.725 --> 50:29.125
or tried to,

50:30.628 --> 50:32.661
but they believed in
me and what I can do.

50:32.663 --> 50:35.464
That belief in me, that's
what changed my mind.

50:37.435 --> 50:39.602
- That doesn't mean
the Tooth isn't a myth.

50:41.105 --> 50:45.541
- No, but now I believe, I
believe it can't be a myth.

50:46.911 --> 50:50.413
- And you could die
whether it is or isn't.

50:50.415 --> 50:52.481
- Seems others believe
it isn't a myth either.

50:56.387 --> 50:58.587
- So risking your
life is worth that?

51:02.660 --> 51:06.395
I'm not sure I understand
it all or even want to.

51:08.332 --> 51:12.101
But I do know, I don't
wanna see you die either.

51:22.914 --> 51:25.581
(gentle music)

51:43.234 --> 51:47.369
- I need you to hold it for
me and don't let go, okay?

51:56.581 --> 51:59.148
(car rumbling)

52:26.744 --> 52:29.378
(solemn music)

53:28.139 --> 53:30.906
- I'm glad to see you
back so soon, Kane.

53:30.908 --> 53:33.509
Your journey was a success?

53:33.511 --> 53:35.811
- [Kane] It's only a success
if I know the girl's okay

53:35.813 --> 53:37.513
and I don't know
that yet, Master.

53:37.515 --> 53:39.448
- Kane, come sit with me.

53:42.620 --> 53:45.688
(suspenseful music)

53:50.928 --> 53:53.128
The outcome may not be
what you want, Kane.

53:54.398 --> 53:56.432
But I want you to be
prepared for this.

53:57.802 --> 53:59.401
- Prepared for?

53:59.403 --> 54:04.006
- The Tooth is a myth, the
healing power is legend.

54:04.008 --> 54:05.507
Perhaps not reality.

54:07.011 --> 54:09.511
Should a young child
pass from this life,

54:09.513 --> 54:13.449
her eternal reward is
greater than what's here.

54:14.785 --> 54:18.020
- I know that, Master.
(phone buzzing)

54:18.990 --> 54:20.756
I'm sorry, Master,
please excuse me.

54:29.467 --> 54:30.366
Yeah.

54:32.737 --> 54:33.902
I'll be there shortly.

54:36.674 --> 54:39.275
There's been a
problem, I have to go.

54:39.277 --> 54:40.242
I'll be back soon.

54:45.049 --> 54:47.249
- Safe travel to you, Master.

54:48.552 --> 54:50.719
- Susie's body
temperature melted it

54:50.721 --> 54:52.121
while she held it in her hand.

54:53.224 --> 54:55.057
But look, there is this
little piece of paper

54:55.059 --> 54:56.325
that was inside the Tooth.

54:57.762 --> 55:00.629
I can't read what it
says but perhaps you can.

55:10.908 --> 55:11.807
Can you read it?

55:13.411 --> 55:14.910
- Yeah.

55:14.912 --> 55:15.944
- What does it say?

55:17.581 --> 55:19.782
- It says I have work to do.

55:19.784 --> 55:24.853
(mysterious music)
(propellor whirring)

55:31.962 --> 55:34.797
(birds chirping)

56:31.522 --> 56:34.356
- [man] Stop there, my
friend, I'm not hiring.

56:39.864 --> 56:41.497
Workload is covered for now.

56:43.534 --> 56:45.401
- I'm not looking for work.

56:45.403 --> 56:47.136
Ryku said I could find you here.

56:48.272 --> 56:50.839
(tools clank)

56:54.912 --> 56:57.479
- Ryku.

56:57.481 --> 57:00.883
Crazy woman, aye, but
a very dangerous woman.

57:02.219 --> 57:04.486
Speakin' her name, I'm
surprised you're standing

57:04.488 --> 57:05.687
in front of me right now.

57:05.689 --> 57:08.557
- If she had her
way, I wouldn't be.

57:08.559 --> 57:10.092
I don't have much time.

57:10.094 --> 57:11.994
- No one has all
the time they need.

57:11.996 --> 57:14.963
A Tooth that can never
be defeated, my friend.

57:15.766 --> 57:17.332
Come, share a brew, my friend.

57:20.971 --> 57:23.205
Easy, friend, I know
why you're here,

57:23.207 --> 57:25.274
but I can't help
you out here, come.

57:33.984 --> 57:37.219
(upbeat music)
(patrons chattering)

57:37.221 --> 57:39.188
- And I said that's
not my donkey!

57:39.190 --> 57:41.657
(man laughs)

57:56.273 --> 57:59.508
- To risking life and
limb for what we love.

57:59.510 --> 58:02.578
Hey, drink up, you never
know, it could be your last.

58:05.716 --> 58:07.616
These guys are on
their best behavior,

58:07.618 --> 58:10.285
they're normally a
little more rowdy.

58:10.287 --> 58:13.322
You commended their attention,
that's a good thing.

58:13.324 --> 58:16.358
Instant respect, a
great trait to wield.

58:17.428 --> 58:19.728
There is always a few
bad apples though.

58:33.844 --> 58:38.914
(flesh thudding)
(men grunting)

59:11.248 --> 59:14.783
- (laughs) Clowns,
the lot of them,

59:14.785 --> 59:15.851
but then again,

59:17.187 --> 59:18.854
you don't go to battle to shack

59:19.657 --> 59:21.356
with a handful of goldfish.

59:23.193 --> 59:26.762
I know why you're here, my
friend, let's take a walk.

59:40.878 --> 59:43.445
(tense music)

59:47.418 --> 59:49.117
Sure the journey's been taxin'.

59:50.187 --> 59:52.654
You're on a journey
that doesn't fright men,

59:52.656 --> 59:53.855
it ends men.

59:54.692 --> 59:56.091
And I'm many a men at that.

1:00:01.432 --> 1:00:04.266
Took an oath many years
ago to protect the Tooth.

1:00:06.036 --> 1:00:07.502
What is your oath, American?

1:00:08.606 --> 1:00:10.105
What do you really fight for?

1:00:19.450 --> 1:00:20.349
- Life.

1:00:21.752 --> 1:00:26.655
- I see, well, I know not if
the Tooth holds the powers

1:00:26.657 --> 1:00:27.956
that people seek it out for,

1:00:29.293 --> 1:00:30.525
but I believe,

1:00:31.762 --> 1:00:33.362
I believe.

1:01:39.897 --> 1:01:42.731
(items clunking)

1:01:45.536 --> 1:01:46.501
Here it is.

1:01:47.838 --> 1:01:49.938
It's a shame you'll
never know what it means.

1:01:51.709 --> 1:01:54.509
(dramatic music)

1:01:58.082 --> 1:02:00.782
(flesh thudding)

1:02:15.365 --> 1:02:18.633
(gatekeeper grunts)

1:02:18.635 --> 1:02:21.436
(flesh thudding)

1:02:24.241 --> 1:02:25.874
Don't do this, my friend.

1:02:27.344 --> 1:02:30.178
(flesh thudding)

1:03:07.851 --> 1:03:10.819
(mysterious music)

1:03:43.854 --> 1:03:44.753
- Get up.

1:03:47.224 --> 1:03:48.123
Get up.

1:03:55.666 --> 1:03:58.834
- [Ruby] I hope you
know a lot about voodoo.

1:03:58.836 --> 1:04:00.268
- [Kane] Well I've been
fortunate in my travels

1:04:00.270 --> 1:04:01.803
to interact with
lots of beliefs.

1:04:01.805 --> 1:04:04.105
Let's just say with
what I know of voodoo,

1:04:04.107 --> 1:04:05.574
I packed a lot of sea salt.

1:04:07.110 --> 1:04:09.678
(tense music)

1:04:15.419 --> 1:04:16.318
- Kane!

1:04:17.354 --> 1:04:18.920
- I have to hurry.

1:04:18.922 --> 1:04:20.422
- This is the end, isn't it?

1:04:22.092 --> 1:04:24.359
- No, I need a ride home.

1:04:27.397 --> 1:04:28.530
- Be careful.

1:04:30.834 --> 1:04:33.668
(dramatic music)

1:04:35.105 --> 1:04:38.273
(motorcycle rumbles)

1:05:18.382 --> 1:05:20.849
(bell rings)

1:05:31.728 --> 1:05:32.861
- I do, papa.

1:05:34.364 --> 1:05:35.864
What'll it be, brother?

1:05:35.866 --> 1:05:39.434
Sticks, stones, roots, bones?

1:05:41.338 --> 1:05:44.272
A power perhaps to fill
the ache in your heart

1:05:44.274 --> 1:05:46.574
or is it something else
you seek on your journey?

1:05:46.576 --> 1:05:48.543
A relic, perhaps.

1:05:48.545 --> 1:05:50.211
Please, have a seat.

1:05:58.255 --> 1:05:59.654
You come with a pure heart,

1:06:00.757 --> 1:06:02.824
yet you know what the
gods have destined.

1:06:12.803 --> 1:06:15.503
I'm not here to stop
you on your journey

1:06:15.505 --> 1:06:16.504
for what you seek.

1:06:18.675 --> 1:06:22.043
I'm here to stop you from
acquiring what you seek.

1:06:24.348 --> 1:06:26.982
Here, brother, you'll need that.

1:06:28.885 --> 1:06:31.386
- I come from a
different belief system.

1:06:31.388 --> 1:06:32.287
Keep it.

1:06:35.826 --> 1:06:38.693
- Beliefs are meant to be
challenged, questioned.

1:06:40.364 --> 1:06:43.431
Very well, brother, you
know what must be done.

1:06:43.433 --> 1:06:46.401
(mysterious music)

1:06:56.613 --> 1:06:59.280
And you know I must stop you.

1:07:06.790 --> 1:07:08.423
I believe this one is yours.

1:07:09.292 --> 1:07:12.027
(ominous music)

1:09:09.079 --> 1:09:11.646
(foot clunks)

1:09:57.961 --> 1:10:01.629
(Kane breathes heavily)

1:10:01.631 --> 1:10:06.701
(dramatic music)
(flesh thuds)

1:10:08.438 --> 1:10:11.172
(men grunting)

1:11:00.790 --> 1:11:03.258
(man shouts)

1:11:11.868 --> 1:11:14.435
(flesh thuds)

1:11:27.284 --> 1:11:30.218
(men grunt)

1:11:30.220 --> 1:11:32.787
(man screams)

1:11:47.170 --> 1:11:52.206
(tense music)
(men grunting)

1:12:32.782 --> 1:12:35.350
(man screams)

1:12:36.519 --> 1:12:39.087
(man screams)

1:12:40.223 --> 1:12:45.293
(ominous music)
(animals chittering)

1:13:13.523 --> 1:13:16.524
(mysterious music)

1:14:41.678 --> 1:14:43.744
- We are looking
for her parents?

1:14:44.848 --> 1:14:46.948
They all stepped out to
get something to eat.

1:14:46.950 --> 1:14:48.249
They should be back shortly.

1:14:49.953 --> 1:14:50.918
- How's she doing?

1:14:50.920 --> 1:14:54.589
- We're just trying to make
her comfortable right now.

1:14:55.625 --> 1:14:57.124
It's been a peaceful morning.

1:14:58.928 --> 1:15:00.127
Are you a friend of the family?

1:15:00.129 --> 1:15:01.295
You look familiar.

1:15:02.532 --> 1:15:04.966
- I'd just like to sit
and stay a few minutes.

1:15:04.968 --> 1:15:08.669
- Yeah, of course, there's
coffee if you're interested.

1:15:08.671 --> 1:15:11.339
(solemn music)

1:15:41.304 --> 1:15:42.904
(door clunking)

1:15:42.906 --> 1:15:44.005
- So how's she doing?

1:15:45.141 --> 1:15:46.340
- You don't know?

1:15:46.342 --> 1:15:47.341
- Know what?

1:15:47.343 --> 1:15:49.310
- I called and texted.

1:15:50.480 --> 1:15:52.013
Oh, please go to
her room right now.

1:15:52.015 --> 1:15:53.314
The doctor will
explain it to you.

1:15:53.316 --> 1:15:54.482
- Oh god!

1:15:57.921 --> 1:15:58.819
Come on!

1:15:59.722 --> 1:16:00.621
Susie?

1:16:07.030 --> 1:16:08.829
- Hi, Mom, hi, Dad.

1:16:08.831 --> 1:16:11.632
(peaceful music)

1:16:19.976 --> 1:16:23.177
- I really have no explanation
for this right now.

1:16:23.179 --> 1:16:27.381
Susie is the picture of
health, a miracle, really.

1:16:27.383 --> 1:16:29.717
We'd like to monitor
her for a few more days

1:16:29.719 --> 1:16:30.685
just to be sure.

1:16:30.687 --> 1:16:32.453
- Yes, yes, of course.

1:16:32.455 --> 1:16:35.256
- The nurse will be along to
check her vitals in a bit.

1:16:35.258 --> 1:16:36.591
I'll leave you alone now.

1:16:58.948 --> 1:17:01.248
(clunking)

1:17:05.655 --> 1:17:06.554
- Kane.

1:17:07.523 --> 1:17:08.990
Kane.

1:17:08.992 --> 1:17:10.191
- Yeah?

1:17:10.193 --> 1:17:12.593
- You have visitors,
you wanna see them now?

1:17:14.631 --> 1:17:15.663
- Yes.

1:17:15.665 --> 1:17:18.299
(gentle music)

1:18:05.581 --> 1:18:06.947
Always sharp, Master.

1:18:06.949 --> 1:18:08.049
- Never sharper.

1:18:09.152 --> 1:18:10.885
- Father Time's taken
a beating for sure.

1:18:10.887 --> 1:18:13.120
- Father Time may
win the last fight.

1:18:13.122 --> 1:18:17.625
I will make sure he has a
losing record when he does.

1:18:17.627 --> 1:18:19.627
- You have to teach
me your ways, Master.

1:18:19.629 --> 1:18:20.895
- So you've come to train.

1:18:20.897 --> 1:18:22.363
- I can't improve
without practice.

1:18:22.365 --> 1:18:24.832
- This is true, white
belt, black belt,

1:18:24.834 --> 1:18:28.135
it doesn't matter,
learning is endless.

1:18:29.005 --> 1:18:30.905
I'm happy to see you, Kane.

1:18:30.907 --> 1:18:32.106
Let's train.

1:18:32.108 --> 1:18:34.909
(majestic music)

1:18:54.263 --> 1:18:57.098
(dramatic music)

1:19:58.561 --> 1:20:01.228
(solemn music)

1:20:55.284 --> 1:20:57.985
(intense music)
