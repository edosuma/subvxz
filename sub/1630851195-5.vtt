WEBVTT

01:44.855 --> 01:47.357
-You need to call off your dogs.
-My dogs?

01:47.983 --> 01:50.527
I know you're trying to have
nasty stories published about Hannah.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.070
Jesus Christ.

01:52.154 --> 01:55.240
-Do you know what time it is over here?
-What time it is where, Fred?

01:55.324 --> 01:57.659
Do I need to explain
the concept of a mobile phone to you?

01:57.743 --> 01:59.203
I don't know where the fuck you are.

01:59.286 --> 02:01.997
I'm in Milan.
I'm trying not to wake up my wife.

02:02.080 --> 02:03.874
Cory, I called you days ago.

02:05.375 --> 02:06.376
These nasty stories,

02:06.460 --> 02:08.336
and it seems to me they're true,
not nasty,

02:08.419 --> 02:09.420
they're your fault.

02:09.505 --> 02:10.506
My fault?

02:10.589 --> 02:12.633
I called to talk
about getting the case dismissed.

02:12.716 --> 02:15.761
You didn't call me back,
so I took matters into my own hands.

02:16.678 --> 02:20.807
-Pays to call back business associates.
-Hey, you and me, we're square.

02:20.891 --> 02:23.435
Let's cut the shit.
You woke me up from a deep fucking sleep.

02:23.519 --> 02:26.480
I don't wanna waste one second
on the phone with an asshole

02:26.563 --> 02:30.901
who's pretending to have any scruples
or the least bit of fucking power over me.

02:31.652 --> 02:32.819
You don't.

02:37.616 --> 02:39.826
And who the fuck knows
what's in that fucking book?

02:40.577 --> 02:41.578
But once it comes out,

02:41.662 --> 02:44.790
those liberal motherfuckers
are gonna act like it's the Bible.

02:44.873 --> 02:47.835
Maggie Brener is the voice of God.
Hannah Shoenfeld--

02:47.918 --> 02:49.962
-You need to shut your fucking mouth.
-No.

02:52.047 --> 02:53.465
No. You're gonna do what I say

02:53.549 --> 02:56.134
and keep your Woody Woodpecker
fucking comments to yourself.

02:56.218 --> 02:59.555
The target is on me.
You were there to give me my exit package.

02:59.638 --> 03:03.475
The woke mob won't like hearing
you paid me off to make yourself CEO.

03:03.559 --> 03:06.103
That was the deal, remember?

03:07.062 --> 03:09.314
Do you really wanna spend
the rest of your life

03:09.398 --> 03:12.359
wondering what I had to say that was
important enough for me to come here?

03:12.442 --> 03:15.404
Cory, they need continuity,
someone who can keep building up,

03:15.487 --> 03:18.407
who doesn't feel the need
to take the place down to the studs.

03:18.490 --> 03:21.493
They need someone unsullied by Mitch.

03:21.577 --> 03:25.247
If it helps you process it,
I am Nixon, and you are my Ford.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.916
You give me my pardon and my exit package,

03:28.000 --> 03:30.919
and I get on that helicopter
and fly off into the sunset.

03:31.003 --> 03:34.381
And then you can tell the country
that our long national nightmare is over.

03:35.799 --> 03:37.342
That's where it ends.

03:37.426 --> 03:39.970
Then you're free to do
whatever you want with my company.

03:40.637 --> 03:45.267
I'll be gone. I'm not gonna stick around
and watch you fuck my wife.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.312
That was the deal.

03:48.395 --> 03:49.730
If that goes away,

03:49.813 --> 03:55.277
Cory, I will have no reason to spare you,
and good fucking luck to you.

04:13.170 --> 04:14.171
Hey.

04:15.005 --> 04:16.005
Hey.

04:16.714 --> 04:19.718
Hey. I texted you. You didn't reply.

04:19.801 --> 04:21.720
How long have you been standing
outside my door?

04:23.388 --> 04:25.224
Well, I choose not to answer that question

04:25.307 --> 04:27.518
on account that the answer
will be incriminating.

04:27.601 --> 04:30.979
-Okay.
-May I come in for a minute?

04:31.647 --> 04:32.856
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

04:40.322 --> 04:44.284
Oh, fuck. Do you know how long it's been
since I've worn shorts just because?

04:44.368 --> 04:47.037
You know I have to get up
at 3:30 in the morning, right?

04:47.120 --> 04:51.708
I know, I know. But what if I was,
I don't know, like, you know, a surfer.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.126
Would you still like me?

04:53.210 --> 04:55.963
Something that didn't have "chief"
in front of it and "officer" at the end?

04:56.046 --> 04:57.214
Okay, what's wrong?

05:02.678 --> 05:03.929
I just-- I'm--

05:05.597 --> 05:09.560
I wanted to see another human being
who I think cares for me as a human being.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.271
Seemed like a healthy thing to do.

05:12.354 --> 05:13.355
Okay.

05:15.190 --> 05:16.191
Also…

05:20.988 --> 05:23.365
I wanted to talk to somebody
who knew Hannah.

05:23.866 --> 05:26.785
What's-- What's going on?

05:30.622 --> 05:33.458
This wrongful death suit.

05:33.542 --> 05:36.086
It is heavy, heavy business and--

05:37.171 --> 05:38.589
-Right.
-And

05:39.423 --> 05:40.424
it's…

05:42.092 --> 05:44.678
easy to forget that she was a real person.

05:45.512 --> 05:48.140
-Yeah, she was.
-Yeah.

05:51.768 --> 05:56.064
Did she tell you anything
about her past or her family, or…

05:58.650 --> 05:59.651
Not really.

06:01.486 --> 06:03.739
She told me her mom died
when she was little,

06:03.822 --> 06:08.243
and she wasn't very close to her dad.

06:10.829 --> 06:13.498
You're not trying to get out of
paying him, are you?

06:17.336 --> 06:18.670
Definitely not.

06:25.761 --> 06:28.722
And the only place you'll see
Wednesday's Democratic debate

06:28.805 --> 06:32.809
live from Las Vegas is on UBA and UBANC.

06:32.893 --> 06:35.938
And make sure you tune in early
and stay tuned after

06:36.021 --> 06:39.483
to see Bradley lead
the pre- and post-debate analysis.

06:39.566 --> 06:40.776
Why, thank you, Alex.

06:40.859 --> 06:43.403
It's Valentine's Day.
Plenty of love to go around.

06:43.487 --> 06:46.823
Okay. "His company's
financial information computers

06:46.907 --> 06:50.953
will do everything,
including give you a blow job."

06:51.036 --> 06:52.037
Impressive.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.748
"I guess that puts a lot of you girls
out of business."

06:54.831 --> 06:55.958
Jesus.

06:56.041 --> 07:00.170
No, no, no. Wait till you read the part
where Bloomberg calls Fergie "a fat broad"

07:00.254 --> 07:03.966
and Princess Anne "a horsey-faced lesbo."

07:04.049 --> 07:06.260
-Horsey-faced?
-It says "lesbo."

07:06.343 --> 07:08.971
Plus, he tried to stop us
from drinking large sodas.

07:09.054 --> 07:11.974
-Which is just un-American.
-Well, that's it. Out.

07:12.057 --> 07:14.977
I'm not gonna ask about sodas, you guys.

07:15.060 --> 07:16.061
Come on.

07:17.980 --> 07:20.357
-I didn't mean you should ask.
-Thank you.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.192
-But…
-It's not about "should."

07:22.276 --> 07:24.194
-It's gross.
-I know. Guys, I'm sorry.

07:24.278 --> 07:26.405
Listen. We just don't have a lot of time.

07:26.989 --> 07:29.116
We're threading a really fine needle here.

07:29.199 --> 07:31.535
And if it looks like
I'm letting them steamroll me,

07:31.618 --> 07:35.622
or that people think
that I'm picking favorites

07:35.706 --> 07:37.124
or that I ask the wrong question

07:37.207 --> 07:39.126
or I ask the right question
the wrong way--

07:39.209 --> 07:40.669
Whatever it is, it's all--

07:40.752 --> 07:43.046
All the attention is gonna land on me

07:43.130 --> 07:46.258
and not choosing the leader
of the free world, okay?

07:46.341 --> 07:47.843
That cannot happen.

07:47.926 --> 07:48.969
-Yep.
-It cannot happen.

07:49.052 --> 07:50.512
Okay.

07:50.596 --> 07:52.723
Okay, so what else are we--

07:53.432 --> 07:55.559
He was pro coal expansion.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.686
-We could pivot into that.
-Turn that into renewable energy.

07:57.769 --> 07:59.771
-Let's do health care.
-That'd be good.

07:59.855 --> 08:02.149
Okay.
How about this, you guys? How about this?

08:02.232 --> 08:04.776
So that it's about more
than just Bloomberg.

08:04.860 --> 08:06.111
"Senator Sanders,

08:06.195 --> 08:11.200
how do you believe
the recently resurfaced quotes about women

08:11.283 --> 08:15.078
attributed to Mayor Bloomberg
will impact his electability

08:15.162 --> 08:19.166
in a general election
against Donald J. Trump?"

08:19.791 --> 08:21.793
Okay. Senator Sanders, two minutes.

08:21.877 --> 08:24.755
The American people
deserve someone who represents them…

08:24.838 --> 08:27.341
-That's Bernie.
-…and not just the one percent.

08:27.424 --> 08:31.386
-Dude, you could just say it.
-Women make up over 50% of voters…

08:31.470 --> 08:33.514
Ouch. Fuck. Right now?

08:33.597 --> 08:35.849
Mayor Bloomberg's treatment
of women, quite frankly, is…

08:35.933 --> 08:40.020
-Be right back. Excuse me.
-…a detriment to the Democratic party.

08:40.102 --> 08:42.231
-You lost her.
-You gotta quit doing Bernie.

08:42.313 --> 08:44.816
You lost her. But he got the hands right.

08:54.993 --> 08:56.161
Audra?

08:56.870 --> 08:59.456
Wha-- What a surprise.

08:59.540 --> 09:02.000
Alex, what a cool office.

09:02.084 --> 09:04.545
Uh-huh. Thank you.

09:04.628 --> 09:07.548
So, how has it been being back?

09:07.631 --> 09:09.633
They're giving you
quite the hero's welcome.

09:10.217 --> 09:12.386
-It's good. It's been really good.
-Yeah?

09:12.469 --> 09:15.514
-Hey, Audra, what are you doing here?
-I'm a little bit early…

09:15.597 --> 09:17.224
-Uh-huh.
-…for a bite with Daniel.

09:17.307 --> 09:20.310
And I thought I would just,
I don't know, pop by.

09:20.394 --> 09:23.564
Well, we don't really have
a "pop by" kind of relationship.

09:23.647 --> 09:27.568
True. I just figured that if I called you,
you would ask what it was about,

09:27.651 --> 09:30.112
and then we would have
this whole conversation over the phone.

09:30.195 --> 09:33.866
And this really feels like
more of a "in person" thing.

09:35.576 --> 09:38.579
What is this dire conversation
that has to be had?

09:39.204 --> 09:40.539
Okay.

09:40.622 --> 09:42.791
Maggie Brener's book
is coming out next month,

09:42.875 --> 09:48.046
and her press agent wants her first stop
on her book tour to be at YDA.

09:49.965 --> 09:51.258
That makes sense.

09:52.384 --> 09:53.218
And?

09:53.302 --> 09:56.722
And I wanna make sure
that you're okay with it.

09:56.805 --> 10:00.017
Because, Alex, if you're not,
I'm not gonna do it.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.977
Why wouldn't I be okay with it?

10:02.060 --> 10:05.355
Well, I don't know.
I mean, I don't know what's in the thing.

10:05.439 --> 10:07.900
They're making me go to their office
to even read it.

10:07.983 --> 10:12.237
But I do assume
that you're a main character.

10:12.321 --> 10:16.575
And, of course, I would assume
that you're okay with it,

10:16.658 --> 10:18.410
me doing the interview.

10:18.493 --> 10:21.288
Because if it wasn't, you wouldn't do it?

10:21.371 --> 10:22.873
I wouldn't.

10:22.956 --> 10:26.168
But I am so glad
that I have your blessing.

10:28.921 --> 10:33.467
Well, I have to get back to it.
I do appreciate, though, you stopping by.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.970
Keep fighting the good fight.

10:37.054 --> 10:38.263
Okay, you know what, Audra?

10:38.347 --> 10:41.183
Come on. Let's just cut the bullshit
for just a second.

10:41.266 --> 10:45.604
I have always been gracious to you,
have I not?

10:45.687 --> 10:46.980
What?

10:50.150 --> 10:51.693
You honestly believe that.

10:53.529 --> 10:57.449
Well, nonetheless,
the past is in the past,

10:57.533 --> 11:01.328
and I'd like to hope that
if the shoe were on the other foot,

11:01.411 --> 11:04.081
you would offer me the same courtesy.
Bye, Alex.

11:11.296 --> 11:12.756
New York will see highs of 45.

11:12.840 --> 11:15.259
We have a cold front coming in
that'll-- that'll--

11:16.218 --> 11:18.303
Okay, next graphic, Tom.
Okay. Good, good. Good.

11:18.387 --> 11:22.057
Out west, a high of 61 in Vegas.
Alex, Bradley, I'll talk about the debate.

11:22.140 --> 11:24.685
Check conditions in your neck
of the woods. We got this. It's good.

11:24.768 --> 11:27.187
Hey, Mia. Mia. Hey.

11:27.271 --> 11:28.897
Hey. I just need a minute, okay?

11:28.981 --> 11:30.983
Why am I not going out into the plaza?

11:31.066 --> 11:33.026
I can't send you out.
It's too unpredictable.

11:33.110 --> 11:35.112
We gotta put this "spirit animal" thing
to bed.

11:35.195 --> 11:38.073
-Okay, I apologized.
-Yeah, well, that came off as insincere.

11:38.156 --> 11:40.576
But I talked to Stella. We have a plan.

11:40.659 --> 11:42.119
I can't send you until everyone's back,

11:42.202 --> 11:43.954
but you and a crew will go
to Florida next week.

11:44.037 --> 11:47.207
You'll tour the Tah-Thi-Ki Museum,
sit with members of the Seminole tribe,

11:47.291 --> 11:49.209
you'll learn about their culture.

11:49.293 --> 11:50.878
Then that will be that.

11:50.961 --> 11:51.962
Okay. I mean--

11:52.045 --> 11:54.548
I'm fine going to the museum,
and I'll talk with the people.

11:54.631 --> 11:56.550
But why does it have to be filmed?

11:56.633 --> 11:59.970
I mean, wouldn't it seem more genuine
if I did that in my private time?

12:00.053 --> 12:02.598
Maybe, but then our audience wouldn't know
you learned your lesson.

12:02.681 --> 12:03.974
You're setting an example.

12:05.017 --> 12:06.268
I think I set an example

12:06.351 --> 12:09.188
by being a pretty decent
first-generation Cuban in this country.

12:09.271 --> 12:11.190
What, you gonna teach me
something about racism now?

12:11.273 --> 12:12.816
You trying to go down this road
with me today?

12:12.900 --> 12:14.943
-'Cause we're gonna need some snacks…
-Come on.

12:15.027 --> 12:16.987
-…on this road. Yanko--
-I'm not talking about you, Mia.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.989
I'm talking about the collective you.
Come on, Mia.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.074
You know what the problem with racism is?

12:21.158 --> 12:23.410
You don't fix it
by pretending to wanna fix it.

12:23.493 --> 12:24.995
And she's full of shit. Stella.

12:25.078 --> 12:28.165
She's-- I mean, prejudice, it--
It's like a scavenger hunt for her.

12:28.248 --> 12:32.377
You should have seen her eyes light up
when she decided I was a Republican, okay?

12:32.461 --> 12:35.589
Now if racism--
If that's still an issue here with me,

12:35.672 --> 12:36.924
I'll deal with that quietly.

12:37.007 --> 12:40.093
But I'm not gonna be Stella's tool
and go and pretend to fight it on TV.

12:40.177 --> 12:44.765
No, I'm not gonna publicly genuflect
at the altar of her progressive bullshit.

12:44.848 --> 12:46.892
-Okay? I'm sorry. Not doing that, okay?
-Yanko--

12:46.975 --> 12:49.228
Actually, I'm not sorry,
and I'm not doing that.

12:53.148 --> 12:56.026
-Rena, could you give us a second, please?
-Sure.

12:56.985 --> 12:58.570
-You're welcome.
-You're amazing.

12:58.654 --> 13:01.490
What's up? You were gone so long
I let everybody go.

13:01.573 --> 13:05.327
That's okay.
So, Audra just stopped by my office.

13:05.410 --> 13:11.500
Apparently, Maggie is going on YDA
to promote her fucking book.

13:11.583 --> 13:13.585
And she just came by
asking for my blessing,

13:13.669 --> 13:15.379
as if she wasn't gonna do it anyway.

13:15.462 --> 13:18.882
Okay. You know
that this book is going to come out

13:18.966 --> 13:21.426
-whether Maggie goes on YDA or not--
-I know it is. I know that, Chip.

13:21.510 --> 13:23.095
You just gotta get me that book.

13:23.178 --> 13:24.847
You want me to get you a--

13:24.930 --> 13:26.265
-How am I supposed to do that?
-Yes.

13:26.348 --> 13:28.767
-They're not gonna give it to me.
-Oh, my God. What a shitty attitude.

13:28.851 --> 13:30.561
-That's not a sh--
-Honestly, you're back one week

13:30.644 --> 13:33.355
-and then you can't do anything. Come on.
-I'm being realistic.

13:33.438 --> 13:37.526
Well, you should find it, because I bet
you're prominently all over that book.

13:39.528 --> 13:40.696
Well, I'm sure I am.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.577
-I'm sorry. That was shitty.
-That was shitty.

13:46.660 --> 13:50.247
You know what, but… whatever. It's true.
We have way too much work to do.

13:50.330 --> 13:53.584
-Can we just get into this, please? And--
-I can't work anymore.

13:53.667 --> 13:55.836
I can't work-- I gotta go home.

13:55.919 --> 13:57.171
-I gotta get out of here.
-Well--

13:57.254 --> 13:59.715
Well, can you at least stick around
for a few minutes?

13:59.798 --> 14:01.717
-Madeleine is stopping by and--
-Oh, shoot.

14:01.800 --> 14:03.802
I-- Listen, I would love to, but I gotta--

14:03.886 --> 14:06.847
I honestly-- I fucked up my back.
Something's wrong. I just--

14:06.930 --> 14:08.599
I gotta get out of this place.

14:08.682 --> 14:11.393
-I'm really sorry. Okay?
-Sure. Sure.

14:11.476 --> 14:13.604
-Okay. Well, rest up, and--
-I'm sorry. I will.

14:13.687 --> 14:16.481
-I don't-- Happy Valentine's--
-Happy Valentine's Day.

14:31.246 --> 14:34.333
That's the last one.
Think you got everything you need?

14:34.416 --> 14:36.335
I think we have everything, yep.

14:37.794 --> 14:40.589
-Well, that wasn't so hard, was it?
-No.

14:40.672 --> 14:43.425
Thank you for helping me. Really.

14:43.509 --> 14:45.761
You could have chosen
to quarantine without me.

14:50.432 --> 14:51.683
Why didn't you?

14:55.562 --> 14:56.605
I like your company.

15:03.946 --> 15:06.949
I don't want you to think that--

15:07.032 --> 15:09.826
What I'm-- We're not gonna sleep together.

15:13.622 --> 15:16.667
That's not what I meant. I-- I…

15:16.750 --> 15:18.502
Sorry, that's-- I'm not--

15:21.505 --> 15:24.132
I j-- I'm just-- I'm glad you're here.

15:24.216 --> 15:27.970
I'm glad I can help with the documentary.
That's all I'm-- That's all.

15:28.554 --> 15:29.555
I know that.

15:31.348 --> 15:33.559
-This isn't about you.
-I know that.

15:35.644 --> 15:37.396
You're a very beautiful woman.

15:37.479 --> 15:39.606
You're a good person.

15:40.732 --> 15:45.279
Kind, funny, smart, fun to be with.

15:46.363 --> 15:47.364
I know.

15:56.039 --> 15:57.583
I'm just pretty damaged.

15:59.793 --> 16:01.003
I know.

16:07.342 --> 16:08.677
Then why do you want to stay?

16:12.598 --> 16:16.268
The damage thing, you know,
makes me feel at home.

16:19.188 --> 16:21.148
You didn't say I had good judgment.

16:29.281 --> 16:31.408
-Here he is.
-Thank you, Jasmyn.

16:31.491 --> 16:32.784
-Hi. You're here.
-Hello.

16:32.868 --> 16:34.203
Sorry, give me a second.

16:34.286 --> 16:37.456
So, this is TMS, huh?

16:37.539 --> 16:40.501
Well, this is just debate central.
TMS is an idea.

16:42.794 --> 16:46.798
Well, don't blow my mind before
the Alex Levy meet and greet you promised.

16:47.508 --> 16:49.134
Shoot. I am so sorry.

16:49.218 --> 16:52.137
I forgot to tell her you were coming,
and she had to go.

16:52.888 --> 16:57.184
-Does she have Valentine plans or--
-No, no, she-- She just…

16:58.477 --> 17:00.521
Shit got real today…

17:01.813 --> 17:05.651
and I can't believe she got me
to come back here. So…

17:07.027 --> 17:08.153
Hey.

17:08.737 --> 17:11.615
No matter what happens,
we'll figure it out, okay?

17:12.449 --> 17:14.492
I will always teach, and you--

17:15.618 --> 17:17.954
You can raise alpacas
and make them debate each other.

17:18.955 --> 17:20.207
-Okay?
-Okay.

17:20.290 --> 17:21.708
-Okay?
-Yeah.

17:22.626 --> 17:23.752
Take me out tonight?

17:24.711 --> 17:26.755
-Yes. Let me just finish up, okay?
-Okay.

17:26.839 --> 17:27.839
All right.

17:31.218 --> 17:32.553
-Hey.
-Hey.

17:32.636 --> 17:35.973
I chartered the plane out of Teterboro
for you tomorrow at 1:00.

17:36.056 --> 17:38.725
You're scheduled to land in Green Bay
about 4:00.

17:39.393 --> 17:41.854
-What's in Green Bay, by the way?
-It's a personal thing.

17:41.937 --> 17:43.856
And you're the only one
that knows about it.

17:46.817 --> 17:48.277
You don't need a hotel, right?

17:48.360 --> 17:50.279
Because I booked you
to come back tomorrow.

17:50.362 --> 17:53.490
Yeah, no, I don't.
And cancel all my Vegas travel.

17:53.574 --> 17:54.992
Stella's gonna be there.
She can handle it.

17:55.075 --> 17:56.827
-I got too much to do here.
-Yeah, no problem.

17:56.910 --> 17:59.204
-Itinerary's in your calendar.
-Good.

17:59.288 --> 18:00.914
-Your juice.
-Thank you.

18:03.876 --> 18:07.296
Hey, by the way, you know who's dating?

18:08.422 --> 18:12.050
Laura Peterson and Bradley Jackson.

18:12.134 --> 18:13.927
No, they're not.

18:14.011 --> 18:16.680
Well, I don't know
if they're dating exactly.

18:16.763 --> 18:19.725
It's unclear if there's any romance.
But my friend saw them walking--

18:19.808 --> 18:21.894
Nobody likes a gossip, Kyle.

18:24.688 --> 18:27.191
-Right. Got it.
-No, no, no.

18:27.274 --> 18:30.319
No. No. Not that.

18:30.903 --> 18:32.112
It's not true.

18:33.780 --> 18:37.034
But also, nobody likes a gossip, Kyle.
Don't be a gossip.

18:38.660 --> 18:40.537
Okay. Okay.

18:42.956 --> 18:44.541
-Have a good trip.
-Okay.

18:53.425 --> 18:54.968
No. No. No.

19:07.731 --> 19:09.358
I don't have to go.

19:16.949 --> 19:21.203
You cannot go bleary-eyed
to the board meeting, understood?

19:21.286 --> 19:24.748
I'm gonna tell them
that I'm not coming back

19:24.831 --> 19:26.542
unless they rehire you.

19:27.417 --> 19:28.544
I'm not.

19:29.545 --> 19:30.838
I have leverage.

19:31.797 --> 19:34.174
Do not.

19:35.300 --> 19:37.803
I'm-- I'm better off.

19:40.013 --> 19:41.223
Seriously.

19:41.807 --> 19:42.975
Can't you see?

19:44.351 --> 19:46.728
It's gonna be so weird
to be there without you.

19:58.740 --> 20:01.201
But maybe it would have its advantages.

20:10.961 --> 20:15.424
Well, then maybe being bleary-eyed
wouldn't be the worst thing.

20:30.314 --> 20:35.444
So, this interview with Mayor Pete
just miraculously popped up?

20:36.987 --> 20:39.448
Well, we didn't get to spend
Valentine's Day together,

20:39.990 --> 20:42.075
so I miraculously called Mayor Pete,

20:42.159 --> 20:45.537
and he miraculously scheduled
an interview.

20:58.884 --> 21:00.260
Oh, fuck.

21:02.262 --> 21:03.972
Do you have any Advil?

21:04.056 --> 21:07.601
-You got a headache?
-It's my back. I told you that yesterday.

21:07.684 --> 21:08.852
O-- Okay.

21:09.478 --> 21:10.521
Sorry.

21:12.814 --> 21:16.693
-You wanna have it looked at or something?
-I have to moderate a debate.

21:18.570 --> 21:20.614
I can send someone to the hotel.

21:23.492 --> 21:25.369
I'm gonna make you work for it.

21:25.452 --> 21:26.495
Good.

21:26.578 --> 21:28.747
What the fuck is she doing here?

21:30.207 --> 21:32.918
-She works for UBA. I don't--
-I don't care. Come on.

21:34.253 --> 21:36.797
-She makes me so uncomfortable.
-Why? It doesn't--

21:37.673 --> 21:39.925
I don't know.
She doesn't like me, for one.

21:40.008 --> 21:41.260
-Never has.
-That's not true.

21:41.343 --> 21:45.264
She has never, ever, ever been nice to me.
And I don't know why.

21:46.431 --> 21:49.434
-What is wrong with you?
-I don't know. I don't know.

21:49.518 --> 21:52.813
I don't know. I just don't-- Something's--
I don't feel good. I don't feel right.

21:52.896 --> 21:56.441
I feel stressed. I'm tired.
And I'm just, like, my back, it just--

21:57.776 --> 22:00.320
I feel like there's, like,
this monster inside of my body

22:00.404 --> 22:04.032
and I can't-- I can't get it out of me.
I can't get it out.

22:05.117 --> 22:06.118
It's just--

22:07.119 --> 22:08.287
That's why we need to--

22:08.370 --> 22:12.040
Just get me a fucking Advil, please.
Jesus, God.

22:13.834 --> 22:14.918
Get it yourself.

22:15.752 --> 22:17.087
What did you just say?

22:17.963 --> 22:19.590
-It's coming.
-Just say-- Okay.

22:20.132 --> 22:21.383
Thank you.

23:11.391 --> 23:12.392
Hey.

23:13.018 --> 23:15.646
What makes you think
it's okay to just walk in here?

23:16.980 --> 23:20.359
Apologies.
Are you not open, Mr. Shoenfeld?

23:23.111 --> 23:24.112
I'm--

23:24.613 --> 23:26.740
-I'm Cory Ellison.
-I know.

23:27.449 --> 23:30.118
-I am suing you.
-That you are.

23:30.702 --> 23:31.745
And I just wanna say,

23:31.828 --> 23:35.541
I do not wanna hear you telling me
what a great girl Hannah was

23:35.624 --> 23:38.710
-and how sorry you are for my loss.
-I understand.

23:38.794 --> 23:41.630
Well, that's fine, but you still haven't
answered my question.

23:41.713 --> 23:45.175
What makes you think
that it's okay for you to just show up

23:45.259 --> 23:46.426
and walk in here?

23:46.510 --> 23:49.263
None of it is okay.

23:50.389 --> 23:53.392
But I needed to talk with you
without all the lawyers.

24:05.821 --> 24:09.032
Well, first of all, we may be
on different sides of this lawsuit,

24:09.116 --> 24:11.493
but we're on the same side of the issue.

24:11.577 --> 24:14.204
The network bears responsibility
in all of this,

24:14.288 --> 24:15.998
and the network should pay.

24:16.081 --> 24:20.878
119.2 million is a rounding error for UBA.

24:20.961 --> 24:24.089
You think rules don't apply to you,
showing up at my business.

24:24.173 --> 24:26.091
We're gonna make you really pay.

24:26.175 --> 24:27.843
Did you say "you"? "You"?

24:27.926 --> 24:30.387
UBA, they're a company.
This is a corporation.

24:30.470 --> 24:31.722
There is nothing to hurt.

24:31.805 --> 24:33.515
Why are you here
if there's nothing to hurt?

24:33.599 --> 24:36.226
Would you take the fucking money? Take it!

24:36.310 --> 24:39.146
It's not gonna make you feel
any differently, but it's all that's left.

24:39.229 --> 24:42.399
-You need to take the settlement.
-Don't yell at me.

24:42.482 --> 24:44.943
I'm not. This is not me yelling yet.

24:45.027 --> 24:47.112
But I'm trying to drive reason
into your brain.

24:47.696 --> 24:48.864
We're closed!

24:50.741 --> 24:52.034
Look.

24:52.117 --> 24:56.663
We said we'd settle if you paid us
what you paid that fuck, Fred Micklen,

24:56.747 --> 24:58.332
just for him to go away.

24:58.415 --> 25:00.918
I would pay you if it was up to me.

25:01.001 --> 25:03.420
But I have a board and shareholders
I have to answer to

25:03.504 --> 25:06.882
who are not gonna agree
to pay you $119.2 million, period.

25:06.965 --> 25:10.427
Well, what the hell is wrong with them
that they agreed to pay it to that fuck?

25:11.428 --> 25:13.055
This case of yours,

25:13.138 --> 25:19.061
it's gonna get thrown out,
and you're gonna get nothing. Nothing.

25:19.144 --> 25:21.897
Please, take something. Take the money.

25:21.980 --> 25:25.275
It's the best that you're gonna get.
Please. Take the deal.

25:29.613 --> 25:30.739
Look. I'm almost 70.

25:30.822 --> 25:35.869
The money is meaningless to me
unless I can use it to resurrect her

25:35.953 --> 25:37.621
or buy her a better dad.

25:51.718 --> 25:56.223
Mr. Shoenfeld, your daughter is
about to get smeared in the press.

25:57.599 --> 25:59.059
Smeared?

26:00.310 --> 26:02.771
-They're gonna try to--
-"They're" gonna do it.

26:02.855 --> 26:05.107
Not you, they.

26:05.190 --> 26:09.069
Yeah, they, not me.
I didn't have to come here.

26:10.153 --> 26:13.323
My interest is in trying to do right
by your daughter.

26:13.407 --> 26:15.617
They're gonna try to make it seem like
she had problems

26:15.701 --> 26:18.537
-long before she got to UBA.
-What kind of problems?

26:24.585 --> 26:26.837
They're gonna say
she was a longtime drug addict…

26:28.005 --> 26:29.339
before she got to UBA,

26:29.423 --> 26:32.050
before she met Mitch Kessler
and Fred Micklen.

26:32.634 --> 26:33.635
And…

26:34.344 --> 26:37.764
And that your daughter slept with people
in order to get information.

26:37.848 --> 26:40.893
Awful stuff, purposely awful.

26:40.976 --> 26:43.353
They wanna make it too hard
for you to keep going with it.

26:43.437 --> 26:44.771
They wanna make you go away.

26:48.942 --> 26:50.235
Well, is it true?

27:51.588 --> 27:54.675
Tomorrow you and Eric are meeting
with Deena Pham to get acquainted,

27:54.758 --> 27:57.386
and then you're spending
the rest of the day doing a full mock.

27:57.469 --> 28:00.931
You've got to get to bed early
to be up for TMS Monday at 4:00 a.m. here.

28:01.014 --> 28:03.183
It's Vegas.
4:00 a.m. is when the party starts.

28:03.684 --> 28:05.352
No party. Work. Let's get out of here.

28:05.435 --> 28:07.479
-I know. I know. Okay.
-I'll see you guys in 25.

28:07.563 --> 28:08.772
-Bye.
-Listen.

28:08.856 --> 28:11.191
-Everything's gonna be okay.
-I know it's gonna be fine.

28:11.275 --> 28:12.943
-Okay? This is all doable.
-All doable.

28:13.026 --> 28:15.696
-Nothing bad's gonna happen.
-Nothing bad's gonna-- Shit.

28:17.489 --> 28:19.324
-Shit. Fuck me.
-Shit. Shit.

28:19.408 --> 28:20.617
Did she see me?

28:21.368 --> 28:25.038
-Is she still-- What's she doing?
-I don't-- No. Not-- Hold on.

28:25.122 --> 28:27.124
-Just keep your head down.
-But don't look.

28:27.207 --> 28:29.626
Okay. So I should maybe look like
I'm looking for something.

28:29.710 --> 28:31.837
-She-- Don't turn. Don't turn.
-Thank you.

28:32.546 --> 28:35.883
She's gone. She's gone. See? It's fine.

28:35.966 --> 28:39.511
You just said
nothing bad could happen. Oh, God.

28:56.945 --> 28:59.072
Get it! Fido!

29:04.411 --> 29:08.165
Very good. Here. Take. Take.

29:08.248 --> 29:12.294
Take. Take. Take it. Take. Ta--

29:18.383 --> 29:19.468
Bravo.

29:29.228 --> 29:30.229
Hey.

29:32.397 --> 29:34.858
Hey, take your virus and go back to China.

29:34.942 --> 29:36.151
What?

29:36.735 --> 29:38.695
Hey, don't give me your China virus,
ching chong.

29:39.530 --> 29:42.616
You don't know what you're talking about.
Go educate yourself.

29:44.117 --> 29:46.495
Go fuck yourself, you slanty-eyed bitch!

29:47.746 --> 29:49.790
Stop giving everybody your bat virus!

29:56.922 --> 29:58.590
The fuck's your problem, man?

29:58.674 --> 30:01.635
You fucking ignorant asshole.
And she's Korean, you fuckwit.

30:01.718 --> 30:03.470
Why don't you go back
to your shitty country

30:03.554 --> 30:05.389
and stay the fuck out of ours, dickhead?

30:09.226 --> 30:10.519
Get your fucking hands off me!

30:11.895 --> 30:14.356
Hey, hey, hey! Relax! Stop.

30:16.441 --> 30:17.943
All right, all right. Come on.

30:22.072 --> 30:23.073
Fuck.

30:23.156 --> 30:25.200
Thank you, Senator Sanders.

30:25.284 --> 30:27.160
That concludes tonight's debate.

30:27.244 --> 30:29.246
Our thanks to my fellow moderators,

30:29.329 --> 30:31.748
to the candidates,
and of course, to all of you,

30:31.832 --> 30:33.917
the audience here and at home.

30:34.001 --> 30:35.919
The Nevada caucuses are this Saturday,

30:36.003 --> 30:39.882
with the South Carolina primary
just one week later.

30:39.965 --> 30:42.217
Then the big prize,
Super Tuesday, on March 3rd.

30:42.301 --> 30:44.219
We'll be following it all for you.

30:44.303 --> 30:48.390
For now, from all of us at UBA,
I'm Alex Levy. Good night.

30:49.016 --> 30:51.101
Okay. Great rehearsal, everyone.

30:51.185 --> 30:53.687
-That's a wrap for today.
-Oh, God. Can I have an Advil, please?

30:53.770 --> 30:54.980
-I know we're in Las Vegas…
-Yeah.

30:55.063 --> 30:57.399
…but let's not get too crazy.
Be in bed by 11:00.

30:57.482 --> 31:00.819
We're back here at 8:00 a.m.
after Alex wraps TMS. Enjoy your night.

31:00.903 --> 31:01.904
It's good.

31:02.696 --> 31:04.031
-It's good?
-Yeah, yeah.

31:04.615 --> 31:05.616
Wanna get a drink?

31:06.283 --> 31:07.284
With you?

31:09.036 --> 31:11.079
I don't see anybody else here.

31:11.872 --> 31:13.916
-All right.
-Come on. I know a terrible place.

31:13.999 --> 31:16.001
-It'll be fine.
-I'm sold. Just help me.

31:16.084 --> 31:19.087
-All right. You good?
-Just don't mind being my wheelchair.

31:19.171 --> 31:21.298
-Yeah, I got you.
-Jeez.

31:21.381 --> 31:23.926
Have you heard from Professor Viola
at all?

31:24.009 --> 31:26.428
No. I hope he's okay.

31:29.097 --> 31:33.435
He's been very present in my life
every day since, you know?

31:33.519 --> 31:36.188
I've been watching that interview
over and over.

31:38.106 --> 31:39.316
Admiring your work?

31:39.942 --> 31:42.361
No, not at all.

31:42.444 --> 31:45.656
I mean, I get more bummed out
each time I watch it.

31:45.739 --> 31:47.741
-It's really good.
-I don't know.

31:47.824 --> 31:49.451
All I see-- Yeah, it's great.

31:50.285 --> 31:52.120
Sorry. It's great.

31:52.204 --> 31:54.248
But all I see is missed opportunities.

31:54.331 --> 31:56.166
-You know?
-It is great.

31:56.750 --> 31:57.876
You're very new to this.

31:57.960 --> 32:00.546
But even if you weren't new,
it would still be great.

32:00.629 --> 32:02.673
I need more practice, you know?

32:02.756 --> 32:04.508
-I need--
-Once this COVID thing is over,

32:04.591 --> 32:06.802
you're gonna have all the practice
you can handle.

32:07.427 --> 32:09.137
Gonna be up to your eyeballs
in this stuff.

32:13.100 --> 32:15.853
Let me interview you.

32:16.937 --> 32:17.938
Let's not.

32:18.021 --> 32:20.190
It would be so helpful.

32:20.274 --> 32:21.567
I appreciate that.

32:21.650 --> 32:24.319
But the last time
I was supposed to be interviewed,

32:24.403 --> 32:25.946
it didn't go well.

32:26.029 --> 32:29.491
I understand, but in this case,
it would be just for me.

32:29.575 --> 32:31.243
Just for practice.

32:32.369 --> 32:35.747
Come on. We're going to be stuck here
for two weeks.

32:37.040 --> 32:39.626
Okay. I understand.

32:46.008 --> 32:48.635
All I can think about is
what's in that fucking book.

32:48.719 --> 32:49.845
I-- So, I get it, man.

32:49.928 --> 32:53.098
-I'm worried about it too.
-What do you think is in there? Come on.

32:53.182 --> 32:55.601
I don't know.
The Vegas stuff for one, for sure.

32:55.684 --> 32:58.896
Yeah, but if that's in there,
who would have told her about that?

32:58.979 --> 33:01.607
I don't know if it's in there,
but as far as who,

33:01.690 --> 33:02.900
maybe Mia talked to her.

33:02.983 --> 33:05.652
She's clearly not thrilled
with me right now,

33:05.736 --> 33:07.070
and I kinda don't blame her.

33:07.154 --> 33:10.449
That was the same night that
Mitch asked me to take her off his team,

33:10.532 --> 33:13.160
and I just fucking did it.

33:13.243 --> 33:15.329
That could be in there.

33:15.412 --> 33:18.832
I mean, you were talking about how
you didn't want Mitch's garbage.

33:19.875 --> 33:22.628
Wait, what? What?

33:22.711 --> 33:25.881
What-- What do you mean?
That's what you said. Remember? We were--

33:25.964 --> 33:26.965
No, I didn't.

33:27.049 --> 33:28.300
Yes.

33:29.218 --> 33:32.346
You said Mitch could shit where he eats.
You didn't want his trash.

33:32.429 --> 33:35.182
-I know you didn't mean it like that--
-No. I didn't say it.

33:35.766 --> 33:36.975
Hey, I'm not judging you--

33:37.059 --> 33:38.977
You should judge me
if I said something like that.

33:39.061 --> 33:40.229
I just didn't say it.

33:42.314 --> 33:44.483
-Okay, fine. You didn't say it.
-No, don't do that now.

33:44.566 --> 33:46.026
-What?
-Now you're just being a jerk.

33:46.109 --> 33:48.320
-Okay. What do you want from me?
-That just sounds condescending.

33:48.403 --> 33:50.030
I want you to know
that I did not say that!

33:50.113 --> 33:51.240
You…

33:51.865 --> 33:53.450
You do this thing. You--

33:54.660 --> 33:58.038
There are a lot of things
that you conveniently forget.

33:58.914 --> 34:00.457
And it's frustrating.

34:04.294 --> 34:05.629
Oh, my God.

34:06.630 --> 34:07.631
What?

34:07.714 --> 34:10.259
I see you remember everything.

34:12.803 --> 34:14.554
Did you talk to Maggie Brener?

34:17.306 --> 34:19.518
-Yes, but not on the record.
-Oh, my God.

34:19.601 --> 34:22.187
-Don't-- It's not-- It's not--
-Oh, my God.

34:22.271 --> 34:24.773
I can't believe you came back
to work for me and did not tell me

34:24.857 --> 34:26.942
you spilled your fucking guts
to Maggie fucking Brener!

34:27.025 --> 34:29.194
-No, I did not spill my guts, okay? I--
-Oh, shit.

34:29.277 --> 34:31.530
I helped you. I didn't have to.
Let's not forget you got--

34:31.612 --> 34:34.867
-You got me fuckin' fired, okay?
-How-- I did not get you fired.

34:34.949 --> 34:37.159
-I did not get you fired.
-What-- How is that not true?

34:37.244 --> 34:39.538
And what do you mean you helped me?
What's that supposed to mean?

34:39.621 --> 34:40.621
-What do I mean?
-Yeah.

34:40.706 --> 34:45.085
I mean despite all of this shit
that was going on between us, I--

34:45.668 --> 34:48.630
-I did your PR.
-My PR?

34:48.714 --> 34:50.882
-I didn't mean it like that.
-My PR? You think I need PR?

34:50.966 --> 34:51.967
-Come on.
-Got it.

34:52.050 --> 34:53.969
So you think
I'm a really horrible person too.

34:54.761 --> 34:58.015
Wow. Okay, great.
So I don't have an ally in the world.

34:58.098 --> 34:59.308
This is amazing.

34:59.391 --> 35:02.352
-Where's my fucking room? Fucker.
-Okay. Hey.

35:02.436 --> 35:04.771
-Take it easy, okay?
-Goddamn it. Hold on, hold on.

35:04.855 --> 35:07.691
-Are you all right?
-Yes, just-- Just give me a second.

35:07.774 --> 35:09.568
-I think I'm back this way.
-Okay. Listen.

35:09.651 --> 35:12.279
I'm not saying
you're some horrible person, okay?

35:12.362 --> 35:14.573
-Oh, fuck.
-I'm just-- Here, let me--

35:14.656 --> 35:17.367
-Get off me. Don't touch me.
-I'm just trying to--

35:17.451 --> 35:18.660
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

35:18.744 --> 35:23.332
I wanted someone to know
that I was not a horrible person.

35:23.415 --> 35:25.125
-Okay? Fine, I admit it.
-I see. I get it.

35:25.209 --> 35:30.214
I wanted people to know
I leaked the story. Okay?

35:34.593 --> 35:35.594
I see.

35:35.677 --> 35:37.095
-Okay.
-Okay?

35:37.179 --> 35:39.640
So, you wanted to look like a hero.

35:40.307 --> 35:43.435
And what does that mean for me?
What do I look like?

35:43.519 --> 35:47.231
You… are just gonna look like you.

35:48.732 --> 35:49.566
That's it.

35:49.650 --> 35:52.027
This fucking book.
I just fucking can't stand it.

35:52.110 --> 35:55.239
Can't fucking stand this fucking book!
Shit!

36:14.466 --> 36:16.885
Story's killed everywhere but The Vault.

36:16.969 --> 36:19.930
Oh, fuck.

36:20.013 --> 36:24.101
Well, if they publish,
is Shoenfeld gonna back down?

36:24.184 --> 36:25.811
I mean, that's what Fred's after, right?

36:25.894 --> 36:28.063
No, he's gonna soldier on,
and he'll lose the case

36:28.146 --> 36:30.190
or it'll get thrown out,
but that's not really the point.

36:30.274 --> 36:33.861
The point is keeping a dead woman
from being dragged through the mud.

36:34.528 --> 36:38.448
I don't wanna screw up my paycheck,
but does anybody care?

36:38.532 --> 36:40.033
Her dad doesn't.

36:41.952 --> 36:43.078
I care.

36:44.580 --> 36:47.332
Is this personal to you?

36:50.252 --> 36:51.461
Do not.

36:54.464 --> 36:55.674
Okay.

36:56.300 --> 37:00.596
Well, as far as The Vault goes,
I don't know what to tell you.

37:01.180 --> 37:04.183
As soon as they can confirm
what they've got, they'll run it.

37:04.266 --> 37:07.019
The only thing that moves the needle
at a place like that

37:07.603 --> 37:09.855
is an even more salacious story.

37:13.317 --> 37:14.902
Right.

37:26.330 --> 37:28.373
I'm having so much fun.

37:29.124 --> 37:31.376
And to think I wanted
to moderate the debate.

37:31.460 --> 37:33.670
Then I wouldn't have gotten to spend
this time with you.

37:33.754 --> 37:35.130
I wouldn't get to relax

37:35.214 --> 37:39.051
and eat 15 different kinds of weird foods
that don't go together

37:39.134 --> 37:41.178
and put it all on UBA's tab.

37:41.929 --> 37:43.889
By the way, did you see Alex's face?

37:43.972 --> 37:46.767
She looks like she swallowed a lemon
ever since we got here.

37:47.476 --> 37:48.936
I feel kinda bad for her.

37:49.520 --> 37:50.521
Don't.

37:52.272 --> 37:54.525
Is there something specific
that happened between y'all?

37:54.608 --> 37:56.985
I feel like you don't like her,
but I don't know why.

37:57.069 --> 37:59.613
You don't seem to love her.
We bonded over that.

37:59.696 --> 38:01.740
Well, I know I've said some things, but…

38:02.533 --> 38:05.661
I don't know, there's something about her.
I just always end up feeling for her.

38:05.744 --> 38:06.787
Well, just wait.

38:07.412 --> 38:09.456
You don't have to tell me
if you don't want to.

38:10.791 --> 38:12.167
I'll tell you.

38:12.251 --> 38:15.003
Okay, but not because I made you
or I, you know,

38:15.087 --> 38:17.214
-twisted your arm or anything.
-I will tell you.

38:23.428 --> 38:25.973
No, I will. I have nothing to hide.

38:27.516 --> 38:30.352
I was anchoring at YDA.
I was doing really well.

38:31.562 --> 38:35.858
And I had a small group of friends
in the business who knew who I really was.

38:35.941 --> 38:39.319
And then Alex came to town.
She was in the class behind me.

38:39.945 --> 38:43.073
And she made friends
with some of my friends,

38:43.156 --> 38:44.157
started to hang out.

38:44.241 --> 38:46.451
I can't get her to hang out with me.

38:46.535 --> 38:49.329
Yeah. She presented herself differently
back then.

38:50.038 --> 38:53.166
You know,
she was a little bit more easygoing.

38:54.084 --> 38:55.502
A little more sunny.

38:55.586 --> 38:57.462
But she was always a careerist.

38:58.964 --> 38:59.965
Anyhow…

39:01.884 --> 39:03.385
by knowing my friends,

39:03.468 --> 39:05.804
she eventually found out
that I was a lesbian,

39:06.471 --> 39:09.600
and she seemed fine with that, you know?

39:10.100 --> 39:14.855
But then pretty soon after she found out,
Your Day, America found out.

39:17.232 --> 39:19.443
What? Are you saying that she…

39:21.528 --> 39:23.780
-How do you know?
-I don't.

39:25.741 --> 39:26.950
But what I do know…

39:28.952 --> 39:30.871
is that she definitely was
one of the people

39:30.954 --> 39:32.998
who did not show up for me
when it happened.

39:33.081 --> 39:35.709
I stopped getting her calls
and her invites.

39:38.629 --> 39:40.005
And then I remember,

39:41.465 --> 39:44.718
one day I was walking down Fifth Avenue,
and I saw her on the next block,

39:44.801 --> 39:45.928
coming toward me.

39:46.929 --> 39:48.138
And she saw me…

39:51.099 --> 39:55.896
and looked away and crossed the street
so she wouldn't have to run into me.

39:58.148 --> 40:01.193
I never forgot that, and I never will.

40:02.069 --> 40:05.697
Wow. Did you ask her about that?

40:06.740 --> 40:07.991
What's there to say?

40:09.868 --> 40:11.286
I don't know.

40:11.370 --> 40:16.124
No. I'm not gonna waste my time with
people who bring me nothing but chaos.

40:16.208 --> 40:18.919
Life is too short.

40:21.129 --> 40:22.631
Life is chaos.

40:23.131 --> 40:25.175
But that's what this is for.

40:25.259 --> 40:28.136
Clearly, your family has
a different relationship with alcohol.

40:31.640 --> 40:33.016
Who is texting me?

40:33.100 --> 40:35.394
It's Cory. He wants to know if I'm in bed.

40:36.395 --> 40:40.440
"Dear Mr. Ellison,
I was asleep until you texted me."

40:40.524 --> 40:42.776
I think he likes you.

40:42.860 --> 40:45.654
No, he just doesn't trust me
to follow instructions.

40:49.491 --> 40:53.871
Okay. I'm gonna go
and let you text your boyfriend while I--

40:53.954 --> 40:55.497
-I'll just--
-He's not my boyfriend.

40:55.581 --> 40:57.624
I'll be right back. Yeah.

41:10.470 --> 41:13.098
-Hey.
-You know the phone didn't ring.

41:14.183 --> 41:18.937
Well, that's weird.
I had 'em put me through to room 735,

41:19.021 --> 41:20.981
-west tower, right?
-Oh, shit.

41:21.064 --> 41:23.442
I was kinda surprised
you could sleep through all that.

41:23.525 --> 41:27.070
Well, you know,
I'm on TMS early in the morning,

41:27.154 --> 41:29.114
and I have four hours of analysis
after that.

41:29.198 --> 41:31.408
So I just thought I should get
some extra sleep, but--

41:31.491 --> 41:33.911
I even turned down tickets
for Thunder From Down Under--

41:33.994 --> 41:35.204
Yeah, okay, I don't care.

41:35.287 --> 41:37.789
Okay, well, if you don't care,
then let me go back to bed.

41:37.873 --> 41:40.125
No, please, I really need your advice.

41:40.209 --> 41:42.920
-Is something wrong?
-Hey, Bradley.

41:43.962 --> 41:45.631
-Bradley.
-It's Cory.

41:45.714 --> 41:48.091
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

41:48.175 --> 41:49.718
I'm sorry. Are you still there?

41:49.801 --> 41:52.137
I-- Yep, sorry. One second.

42:00.312 --> 42:01.522
Oh, God.

42:02.189 --> 42:03.398
Oh, God.

42:08.403 --> 42:09.530
Oh, God.

42:10.030 --> 42:11.323
Oh, fuck.

42:12.449 --> 42:14.284
Okay. Fuck this.

42:15.410 --> 42:16.411
Ow!

42:22.042 --> 42:25.003
So, there's this story still out there.

42:25.587 --> 42:26.839
And her dad didn't care?

42:26.922 --> 42:29.049
I wouldn't say that,
but he's a tortured soul.

42:29.132 --> 42:30.884
He's not interested in the settlement, so…

42:32.594 --> 42:35.389
if I can't find some way
to keep this story from being published,

42:35.472 --> 42:36.682
it is gonna be published.

42:36.765 --> 42:40.352
This is the one thing she asked,
that her name not get out there.

42:40.435 --> 42:44.064
And it's already out there,
but this is a million steps beyond that.

42:44.857 --> 42:46.775
Jesus. I mean, this would have killed her.

42:47.359 --> 42:51.947
To know at the end of this she was just
portrayed as some unscrupulous drug slut.

42:52.656 --> 42:54.449
What a fucking world.

42:54.533 --> 42:55.868
I know.

43:00.330 --> 43:01.874
So, why don't you go to The Times

43:01.957 --> 43:05.002
and just tell them
that Fred is trying to libel Hannah?

43:07.254 --> 43:09.631
Or do you not wanna do that
because you'll get fired

43:09.715 --> 43:11.592
because it's not
in the network's interests?

43:11.675 --> 43:14.678
No, of course not.
I'm trying to do the right thing, Bradley.

43:14.761 --> 43:16.471
Why is that where your mind goes?

43:17.431 --> 43:18.432
Look.

43:19.099 --> 43:21.143
Hannah told you her story.

43:21.226 --> 43:24.479
She confided things in you
she didn't confide in anyone else.

43:24.563 --> 43:28.483
And, well, for better or worse,
you're my Jiminy Cricket.

43:28.984 --> 43:34.531
So, I'm asking you,
as a moral center of mine,

43:34.615 --> 43:35.616
as the person…

43:37.034 --> 43:40.370
who's more concerned with what's right
or wrong than anyone I've ever met,

43:41.121 --> 43:46.710
if I can find some way to contain this,

43:48.420 --> 43:50.797
to keep Hannah
from being publicly denigrated,

43:51.381 --> 43:52.591
should I do it?

43:55.469 --> 43:58.931
I will do whatever you say,
'cause I know it'll be the right decision.

44:01.850 --> 44:06.355
Should I do whatever it takes
to keep the story from being published?

44:08.148 --> 44:11.026
Yes. Absolutely, yes.

44:11.109 --> 44:14.571
And I'll try to think of some way
to stop it too.

44:14.655 --> 44:15.948
Okay, thanks.

44:17.574 --> 44:20.160
I really, really appreciate it.

44:21.119 --> 44:23.163
Now, I'm gonna let you get some sleep.

44:24.748 --> 44:26.542
Won't be calling up to your room anymore.

44:26.625 --> 44:28.669
Okay. Good night.

44:40.889 --> 44:41.890
All right.

44:44.101 --> 44:45.102
Take your time.

44:51.733 --> 44:53.861
You asked what I thought I did wrong.

44:56.071 --> 45:00.701
I fucked up, obviously.
I shouldn't have done any of it.

45:11.962 --> 45:13.964
I didn't want to be this person.

45:16.091 --> 45:17.843
I didn't want to hurt anyone.

45:19.052 --> 45:21.763
I didn't want people to think
I was the kind of person

45:21.847 --> 45:23.223
that could hurt someone.

45:27.227 --> 45:30.731
And now one of those women is dead,
Hannah Shoenfeld.

45:32.566 --> 45:35.569
And that should have never happened,
obviously. That's just…

45:40.324 --> 45:45.370
I was just self-absorbed and ignorant,

45:45.454 --> 45:47.414
and I thought it's what she wanted.

45:48.540 --> 45:50.584
And if she had just been able to tell me…

45:57.591 --> 45:59.384
It's easy to say right now, but…

46:01.178 --> 46:02.513
if you don't believe me,

46:02.596 --> 46:06.517
then why waste a fucking second
talking to me?

46:07.726 --> 46:09.770
That guy is a monster.

46:13.565 --> 46:15.526
And as bad as it was,

46:16.527 --> 46:19.238
sleeping with her wasn't my real--

46:19.321 --> 46:22.783
wasn't my-- my worst mistake.

46:24.826 --> 46:30.707
A year ago, during the unpleasantness,

46:30.791 --> 46:34.419
I was out of my fucking mind.

46:34.503 --> 46:40.384
I was like a scared little animal
just trying to claw my way back.

46:42.386 --> 46:45.055
So, my back was to the wall,
and what do I do?

46:46.557 --> 46:48.976
I ask Hannah to help me,

46:49.935 --> 46:53.438
which is unbelievably stupid.

46:55.107 --> 47:00.028
But I did. I showed up on her doorstep,
and I asked for her help.

47:01.405 --> 47:04.199
And she told me how she felt.

47:05.868 --> 47:08.328
And she told me
how the situation had hurt her.

47:10.330 --> 47:12.499
And it was so obvious,

47:12.583 --> 47:16.670
the amount of pain she was in
in that moment.

47:17.796 --> 47:20.674
But I still couldn't see.

47:21.341 --> 47:25.095
I didn't understand why she felt that way.

47:26.763 --> 47:29.641
And I pressed harder…

47:30.851 --> 47:32.895
and I said horrible things.

47:36.190 --> 47:41.862
And that is to me-- That's my real crime.

47:46.283 --> 47:47.284
Because…

47:49.703 --> 47:51.872
I can't write it off as ignorance.

47:53.373 --> 47:56.126
I knew what I was doing,
and I did it anyway.

48:29.243 --> 48:30.410
I need to talk to you.

48:32.996 --> 48:34.873
Fuck. Ouch.

48:37.292 --> 48:39.711
-Jesus. Alex, are you okay?
-Oh, fuck.

48:39.795 --> 48:43.006
Oh, God. Please don't waste my time
asking me questions you don't care about.

48:43.090 --> 48:45.425
Wait a minute.
I don't want to see you in pain.

48:46.093 --> 48:48.971
I don't care. I don't care
that you don't want to see me in pain.

48:49.054 --> 48:50.055
You have to.

48:50.973 --> 48:55.894
You can't just write a book about me,
say whatever you want and cause me pain,

48:55.978 --> 49:00.148
follow me across the country
to torment me, and act like you care.

49:00.232 --> 49:03.652
Okay, first of all, I didn't follow you.
It's a presidential debate.

49:03.735 --> 49:06.238
Yeah, one that I'm supposed to be
fucking moderating.

49:06.321 --> 49:10.701
And I didn't say whatever I want.
The book is fact-checked.

49:10.784 --> 49:11.785
Not by me.

49:11.869 --> 49:16.164
Whoever claims to know anything
about my life is full of shit.

49:16.248 --> 49:19.084
Alex, I reached out to you multiple times.

49:19.168 --> 49:22.504
I did my very best to be fair to you
and to everyone.

49:22.588 --> 49:26.508
Fair to me? Fair to me would be
you don't write a book about me.

49:27.050 --> 49:28.093
Okay? Who cares?

49:28.177 --> 49:31.805
Alex, it's a little late
to be storming into my hotel room,

49:31.889 --> 49:33.348
stamping your feet.

49:33.432 --> 49:35.184
What is it you even want?

49:38.312 --> 49:39.771
I would like to see the book.

49:41.815 --> 49:43.275
I don't have a copy on me.

49:44.902 --> 49:46.570
That's such bullshit. That's bullshit!

49:46.653 --> 49:49.072
The thing comes out next month.
You-- Where is it? Come on.

49:49.156 --> 49:50.240
I'm telling you.

49:50.324 --> 49:52.659
-Come on. Where the fuck is it, Maggie?
-I'm telling you.

49:52.743 --> 49:55.454
-I don't have a copy on me.
-Okay, I don't buy that.

49:57.581 --> 49:59.374
-That's not it.
-We'll see.

50:06.173 --> 50:07.341
Oh, my God!

50:08.967 --> 50:10.761
"The Wrong Side of the Bed.

50:11.512 --> 50:15.974
Corruption, cover-ups,
and a crisis of culture on Amer--

50:16.058 --> 50:17.601
America's number one morning show."

50:20.938 --> 50:23.941
What is this? What is this?

50:24.024 --> 50:25.275
What the fuck is this?

50:26.151 --> 50:28.278
It's a mock-up of the cover.

50:29.279 --> 50:30.948
What's in the book?

50:31.031 --> 50:35.035
There's nothing in it about you
that you don't already know.

50:36.745 --> 50:40.374
Tell me what's in the book, Maggie!
Come on, I know I don't come off well.

50:40.457 --> 50:43.418
-You don't like me. You've never liked me.
-That's not true.

50:45.087 --> 50:48.131
-Which part?
-That I've never liked you.

50:50.008 --> 50:52.386
Is there something specific
you'd like to know?

50:58.767 --> 51:01.061
Laura Peterson implied--

51:01.770 --> 51:04.398
The part about you sleeping with Mitch.
That's what you're worried about.

51:07.401 --> 51:08.485
So, it says that?

51:09.403 --> 51:10.487
It does.

51:14.032 --> 51:15.367
Well, it's not true.

51:16.952 --> 51:18.328
I don't-- Who told you that?

51:18.412 --> 51:19.872
-Alex.
-Oh, my gosh.

51:19.955 --> 51:23.041
That is libel. Okay?

51:23.125 --> 51:25.961
Maggie, you better fix that.
You have to fix that.

51:27.171 --> 51:29.840
Otherwise, I swear to God,
you are gonna feel the wrath of God.

51:29.923 --> 51:31.049
I'm not kidding.

51:31.133 --> 51:33.302
Sue me if it's not true.

51:34.344 --> 51:37.431
The book is done,
and I'm not changing that.

51:37.514 --> 51:41.727
And I'm not going to include
this little epilogue,

51:41.810 --> 51:43.896
so don't say I don't care.

51:43.979 --> 51:46.481
I have to moderate a presidential debate

51:46.565 --> 51:49.443
while you're making up salacious shit

51:49.526 --> 51:52.946
about unimportant people
doing unimportant things.

51:54.114 --> 51:55.741
I have to go out there

51:55.824 --> 51:59.661
and speak on behalf of all womenkind
or some bullshit.

52:00.329 --> 52:02.748
And that includes you, okay?

52:05.000 --> 52:07.127
Do not do this to me, Maggie.

52:09.254 --> 52:14.301
Do not associate me with him in that way.

52:15.219 --> 52:19.431
Honestly, Maggie, if you fuck me up,
you're gonna-- Shit!

52:19.515 --> 52:23.519
You're gonna fuck up our whole country.
Jesus. Fuck. Fuck.

52:23.602 --> 52:26.271
Alex, do you wanna maybe lie down
for a little bit?

52:29.149 --> 52:30.150
Oh, God.

52:32.945 --> 52:33.946
Mitch.

52:35.280 --> 52:38.033
-You spoke to Mitch. Did he tell you that?
-I did.

52:39.034 --> 52:41.954
Briefly. All off the record.

52:42.037 --> 52:43.163
I can quote him to you.

52:44.039 --> 52:47.042
He said, "Fuck off."

52:58.720 --> 52:59.847
I'm gonna go now.

53:11.817 --> 53:13.110
Fuck. Fuck.

53:18.740 --> 53:20.576
Oh, my God.

53:32.379 --> 53:35.340
Good evening everyone. I'm Eric Nomani.

53:35.424 --> 53:37.676
Welcome to Las Vegas.

53:37.759 --> 53:39.261
Here with me on the stage tonight,

53:39.344 --> 53:43.515
chief political reporter
for the Las Vegas Weekly, Deena Pham,

53:43.599 --> 53:44.892
and my former partner,

53:44.975 --> 53:48.562
co-anchor of UBA's The Morning Show,
Bradley Jackson.

53:49.855 --> 53:52.232
We want to send our best wishes
to Alex Levy.

53:53.400 --> 53:54.484
Get well soon, Alex.
