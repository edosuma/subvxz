you didn't go in there.

I didn't touch anything.

There were moths.

Are you aware that she
takes anti-psychotic drugs?

-At yourself.

that you killed Chloe.

17:26.133 --> 17:27.367
Why would I do that?

17:27.400 --> 17:29.533

Dump a tonne of soil on it
and bury it once and for all.

38:36.267 --> 38:39.667
-Fuck!
-Jesus fucking Christ.

39:00.200 --> 39:02.333
MAX: Oh, Christ, it's Travis.

39:19.733 --> 39:21.133
ROY: You lied to me.

39:29.300 --> 39:31.067
Roy, it's not safe
for you to be here.

39:32.567 --> 39:35.900
You said whatever
we buried up here
was harmless.

39:35.933 --> 39:39.067
You knew it was more
than toxic waste
when you took the money.

39:39.067 --> 39:42.633
-I took it to help the town.
-You did it
to control the town.

39:42.667 --> 39:45.600
You wanted to be the hero,
then it backfired.

39:45.633 --> 39:46.700
Now get out of here.

39:49.167 --> 39:51.500
I'm not gonna let you
take Anna.

39:52.433 --> 39:54.467
Corrupt to the very end, eh?

39:54.500 --> 39:58.067
-You've done enough damage.
-Anna can make
her own decisions, Roy.

39:58.067 --> 40:01.100
-She's not capable.
-She's very strong.

40:01.133 --> 40:02.533
She's come back here
for a reason.

40:05.233 --> 40:07.000
I've already lost a daughter

40:08.033 --> 40:09.200
and a wife.

40:10.733 --> 40:12.533
I'm not gonna lose Anna too.

40:13.300 --> 40:15.233
So, what're you gonna do, Roy?

40:15.267 --> 40:16.667
You gonna shoot me?

40:17.833 --> 40:19.167
How's that gonna help?

40:26.933 --> 40:28.100
Please...

40:29.667 --> 40:33.800
Whatever deal we had
has nothing to do with her.

40:35.333 --> 40:37.133
All of this,

40:37.167 --> 40:38.967
it's caused nothing but chaos.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.533
And out of chaos comes change.

40:43.600 --> 40:45.000
I'll tell the people
of this town

40:45.033 --> 40:47.100
what you've been doing
up here all this time.

40:48.167 --> 40:50.000
How you've been
poisoning them.

40:50.867 --> 40:53.133
Don't you do
anything stupid, Roy.

40:54.333 --> 40:56.133
You go back into town, now.

42:04.800 --> 42:05.800
(RUSTLING)

42:20.067 --> 42:21.767
MAX: All right.

42:39.833 --> 42:42.067
CRAIG: Let's just get this
over and done with.

42:43.067 --> 42:44.400
MAX: There's gotta be...

42:44.433 --> 42:46.433
No, there's gotta be
another way.

42:46.467 --> 42:48.133
CRAIG: Not that I
can bloody see.

42:59.500 --> 43:01.433
-All right? Okay, go!
-MAX: Yeah.

43:15.867 --> 43:17.500
This doesn't feel right.

43:23.267 --> 43:25.067
We can't take the risk.

43:28.167 --> 43:31.367
I have no intention
of doing time,

43:31.400 --> 43:33.733
especially not for
a piece of shit like him.

43:38.633 --> 43:40.167
What if he killed Chloe?

43:41.333 --> 43:43.067
You want to go
to jail for him?

44:13.067 --> 44:14.333
FERGUS: Shit.

44:21.367 --> 44:22.567
Fergus.

44:22.600 --> 44:25.300
That fingerprint you found,
I know who it belongs to.

44:26.067 --> 44:27.467
What fingerprint?

44:27.500 --> 44:31.700
David Owen.
The scientist from Antarctica.

44:31.733 --> 44:33.133
How do you know about that?

44:33.167 --> 44:35.867
-Anyway, that was a misprint.
-No, no, no, it wasn't.

44:35.900 --> 44:38.367
He's here. He's in Kettering.

44:39.900 --> 44:41.667
Anna, what the fuck
are you talking about?

44:41.700 --> 44:45.067
It's Jens. Jens is David Owen.

44:45.100 --> 44:46.667
I saw him dancing with Chloe.

44:47.700 --> 44:49.167
-Jens?
-Yes.

44:49.200 --> 44:50.567
And now he has Kade.

44:50.600 --> 44:53.800
Kade has some kind of
radiation poisoning.
So do I.

44:53.833 --> 44:56.467
-Okay.
-He killed my mother, Fergus.

44:58.567 --> 44:59.733
Just wait here.

45:30.933 --> 45:33.200
(DOOR CREAKING)

45:42.300 --> 45:44.433
We shouldn't be in here.

45:44.467 --> 45:47.433
-It's a crime scene.
-We need the money.

45:49.433 --> 45:50.700
Close the door.

45:53.933 --> 45:55.100
(DOOR CLOSES)

46:00.400 --> 46:02.333
She said it'd be
under the floorboards.

46:08.700 --> 46:11.467
Eliza, this isn't

46:13.067 --> 46:14.267
where Chloe...

46:16.433 --> 46:17.567
(RUMBLING)

46:21.400 --> 46:23.067
What the hell was that noise?

46:23.067 --> 46:24.633
(RUMBLING)

46:25.267 --> 46:26.400
Eliza!

46:36.700 --> 46:37.733
Anna.

46:39.067 --> 46:41.233
Fergus has told me everything.

46:43.267 --> 46:45.067
You need to come with us.

46:46.300 --> 46:48.200
-Let's go.
-Where?

46:51.367 --> 46:52.567
Just...

46:53.367 --> 46:54.700
Just trust me.

47:12.167 --> 47:14.467
There's nothing here. Ugh...

47:14.500 --> 47:17.133
There's some kind
of room down there.

47:17.167 --> 47:18.700
Come on, let's go.

47:20.400 --> 47:21.700
I can't... I...

47:22.633 --> 47:24.133
I can't go in there.

47:26.300 --> 47:27.867
What are you doing?

47:27.900 --> 47:28.967
(CLATTERING)

47:29.067 --> 47:30.367
Shit, there's someone outside.

47:30.400 --> 47:31.400
Eliza, don't!

47:34.067 --> 47:35.400
Eliza!

47:35.867 --> 47:37.333
(CLATTERING)

47:44.867 --> 47:46.067
Eliza!

47:54.267 --> 47:55.267
Fuck.

47:58.600 --> 47:59.800
Why are we here?

48:01.700 --> 48:02.800
Is this about Mum?

48:04.533 --> 48:05.533
Yes.

49:48.967 --> 49:50.267
Hello?

49:52.833 --> 49:54.133
(ECHO) Hello?

49:56.600 --> 49:57.600
Hello?

50:00.633 --> 50:01.633
(ECHO) Hello?

50:05.333 --> 50:06.433
Dane?

50:09.133 --> 50:10.633
(ECHOES) Dane?

50:14.567 --> 50:15.700
Hello?

50:16.433 --> 50:18.033
(ECHOES) Hello?

50:21.600 --> 50:23.133
Is anyone there?

50:24.633 --> 50:25.900
(ECHOES) Is anyone there?

50:25.933 --> 50:27.333
Somebody?

50:27.900 --> 50:29.567
(ECHOES) Somebody?

51:17.867 --> 51:20.800
-What's going on?
-You're not well, Anna.

51:21.500 --> 51:22.533
You need help.

51:28.833 --> 51:32.500
No! No! No!

51:32.533 --> 51:34.500
No!

51:34.533 --> 51:36.533
Put her in Ward 6.

51:36.567 --> 51:40.433
Please, please, help me!
Please, help me!

51:40.467 --> 51:41.767
Help me!
