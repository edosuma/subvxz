<i>(male narrator)</i>
<i>In the criminal</i>

00:26.159 --> 00:29.822
<i>the people are represented</i>

00:29.896 --> 00:31.796
<i>The police</i>

<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:38.271 --> 00:39.533
I'm home!

dd <i>[radio playing]</i>

00:43.076 --> 00:44.509
Sean, honey.

00:45.378 --> 00:46.538
Maureen.

00:47.680 --> 00:50.649
Frank. Somebody help me
with these groceries.

00:53.186 --> 00:54.710
[Metallic clattering]

00:59.192 --> 01:01.251
Sean, turn that music down.

01:02.095 --> 01:04.120
It's not gonna help me
memorize the periodic table.

01:04.197 --> 01:07.689
You always do fine.
Stop worrying.
Where's your sister?

01:08.868 --> 01:10.392
Oh, not again!

01:12.138 --> 01:14.038
Where'd your father go?

01:14.107 --> 01:16.541
B-line tenants said
there's no hot water.

01:17.444 --> 01:21.175
He's fixing the boiler,
I think.
I think he's in the shop.

01:21.748 --> 01:24.046
I wish they'd buy
a new boiler.

01:30.323 --> 01:31.483
Frank?

01:37.764 --> 01:39.595
[Water running]

01:47.941 --> 01:49.135
Frank?

02:04.457 --> 02:05.719
Oh, my God.

02:07.327 --> 02:08.453
Frank?

02:10.997 --> 02:14.160
Oh, God. Oh, God, Frank.

02:14.334 --> 02:16.734
Oh, God. Oh, God, Frank.

02:16.903 --> 02:19.701
Oh, God. Oh, God, oh, God.

02:19.806 --> 02:22.240
(Melendez)
Hey, it goes with the job
these days.

02:22.308 --> 02:25.800
The Super stops a break-in,
he gets his head bashed in.

02:25.912 --> 02:27.436
[People chattering]

02:27.547 --> 02:30.778
(Briscoe)
Looks like he's been moved.
Who touched the body?

02:31.551 --> 02:34.281
When we showed up,
the wife was holding him
like a baby.

02:34.354 --> 02:36.822
She won't let go.
I think she was in shock.

02:36.890 --> 02:40.417
McKinnon, Frank, 44.
Heard a noise,
came out with a hammer.

02:41.494 --> 02:43.724
Everybody's got to
be a hero.

02:44.264 --> 02:47.358
Broke the window trying to
get the security bar.

02:47.700 --> 02:51.136
Every piece of glass,
even slivers. Everything goes
into Forensics.

02:51.204 --> 02:52.569
Did anybody get inside?

02:52.639 --> 02:55.767
Doesrt look like it.
He was in the boiler room.
When he came out...

02:55.842 --> 02:57.537
they were probably
still working the door.

02:57.610 --> 02:59.908
He should've gone back in.
His tool kit had
a knife in it.

02:59.979 --> 03:01.503
At least he'd have a chance.

03:01.581 --> 03:04.448
Should've gone back in
and called 911.

03:04.884 --> 03:08.411
(Sean)
Why'd he go out by himself?
I mean, why didn't he call me?

03:08.988 --> 03:11.047
This is Detective Briscoe.

03:11.124 --> 03:13.786
Mr. McKinnors son, Sean.
Hi, Sean.

03:15.261 --> 03:18.458
You know, if I'd worked
on the boiler like he wanted,
I mean...

03:18.531 --> 03:20.999
none of this would
have happened.
I could have <i>...</i>

03:21.067 --> 03:24.161
Sean, why don't you
take care of your mom. Okay?

03:24.304 --> 03:25.965
[Siren wailing]

03:27.574 --> 03:30.634
ME says one blow did the job.
Crackhead?

03:31.344 --> 03:33.869
Makes you mad,
makes you strong.
Tell you one thing...

03:33.947 --> 03:36.507
if we don't get good prints,
goes to the three-day
and dies.

03:36.583 --> 03:38.949
(Maureen)
Sean! Excuse me, please. Sean!

03:39.652 --> 03:42.382
Hey, that's my sister.
Let her in.
What's going on?

03:42.455 --> 03:43.683
What the hell is this?

03:43.756 --> 03:47.351
Oh, honey.
Uncle Ned, why are you here?
What is this?

03:47.427 --> 03:49.725
There was a break-in
and your father
tried to stop them.

03:49.796 --> 03:51.559
So, where is he?
Is he okay?

03:51.631 --> 03:53.462
Oh, my God! Oh, no!

03:53.533 --> 03:55.262
(Maureen)
No. Please!

03:55.435 --> 03:56.959
[Shushing]

04:45.752 --> 04:47.686
There's only been
two robberies in,
I don't know...

04:47.754 --> 04:48.778
a couple of years.

04:48.855 --> 04:50.982
Okay, so as far as
you know, he was well-liked...

04:51.057 --> 04:52.649
no problems with anybody
in the neighborhood.

04:52.725 --> 04:55.455
I never heard any.
I mean, the building
was crazy about him.

04:55.528 --> 04:57.553
Just this morning
he was here fixing the sink.

04:57.630 --> 05:00.098
I mean, most Supers,
you have to open
your wallet first.

05:00.166 --> 05:01.292
Frank wouldn't take a dime.

05:01.367 --> 05:03.699
Nancy, it's Frank McKinnon.

05:03.770 --> 05:06.295
Some burglars beat him up.
He's dead.

05:06.372 --> 05:07.771
Oh, my God!

05:07.840 --> 05:10.274
It was around 9:30.
Were you home?

05:10.343 --> 05:12.402
Did you hear any noise,
maybe shouting?

05:12.478 --> 05:14.412
Who listens?
The whole city shouts.

05:14.480 --> 05:15.879
(Nancy)
Wait, 9:30 <i>...</i>

05:15.948 --> 05:18.781
Yeah, I was coming
from the video store.
I did hear an argument.

05:18.851 --> 05:20.375
I thought it was 2A,
the Horowitzes.

05:20.453 --> 05:22.353
Him and his brother-in-law
again.

05:22.422 --> 05:25.186
Nancy, darling,
they went to the country
on Wednesday.

05:25.258 --> 05:28.352
Oh, you're right.
Okay, but you heard
two men yelling, right?

05:28.428 --> 05:32.159
Yeah, but I thought
it was Nat Horowitz.
I didn't even look.

05:32.398 --> 05:36.061
No prints on the door,
unusable partials
on the hammer.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.167
Similar M. O.
In the neighborhood?

05:38.237 --> 05:40.603
Fire escapes, windows,
but no basements.

05:40.673 --> 05:42.368
Break-in at 9:30.

05:42.575 --> 05:44.236
That's not a pro.

05:44.510 --> 05:46.671
Crackheads or kids.

05:47.080 --> 05:49.674
Gets hit with his own hammer.
Now...

05:49.749 --> 05:53.617
if I was the kind of kid
who broke into buildings,
I'd probably be armed.

05:53.686 --> 05:55.950
I got to admit,
the same thing occurred to me.

05:56.022 --> 05:57.649
A gun, at least a knife.

05:57.724 --> 06:00.852
Hey, you want
to look for holes, I got one
as big as my kitchen.

06:00.927 --> 06:03.418
Noisy boiler room,
the guy's hammering...

06:03.496 --> 06:06.021
and he hears glass break
in the hall?

06:07.066 --> 06:10.934
Talk to Forensics.
I'll run a family,
see if anything pops.

06:12.638 --> 06:15.004
Suppose this guy
broke into his own building?

06:15.074 --> 06:18.441
Oh, sure. He forgot the key.
Blood on the broken glass.

06:18.511 --> 06:20.741
The ME also sent over
a sample of the victim.

06:20.813 --> 06:22.644
How close?
It's perfect.

06:22.715 --> 06:24.842
It's the same blood.
What?

06:25.251 --> 06:26.479
Well...

06:27.186 --> 06:29.017
maybe it's one of our guys
did it...

06:29.088 --> 06:31.682
got the victim's blood
on his gloves before
he picked up the glass?

06:31.758 --> 06:33.487
[Telephone ringing]
Maybe.

06:37.363 --> 06:38.523
Medill.

06:40.733 --> 06:42.325
Your Lieutenant calls.

06:44.470 --> 06:45.869
Yeah, Logan.

06:46.372 --> 06:47.498
[Mumbles]

06:48.374 --> 06:49.671
For what?

06:52.011 --> 06:55.037
Frank McKinnors daughter's
got a juvenile record.

06:55.114 --> 06:57.378
Criminal Possession Four.
Okay.

06:57.450 --> 06:58.576
She got a counselor?

07:01.954 --> 07:03.649
(Bernice)
Maureen had a big coat.

07:03.723 --> 07:05.714
Went through Macy's,
filled it with gold...

07:05.792 --> 07:08.352
lipsticks, and enough clothes
for an army.

07:08.428 --> 07:12.694
I had an uncle who had a coat
like that. He used to load up
the pockets with ashtrays.

07:12.765 --> 07:16.292
The boy Maureen hangs with,
ashtrays aren't on his list.

07:18.771 --> 07:23.265
Mitchell Lewis, 16, truant,
runaway, possession three,
juvenile assault.

07:23.976 --> 07:26.069
Just the kind of kid
I'd like for my daughter.

07:26.145 --> 07:27.510
Not a lovely boy.

07:27.580 --> 07:30.572
Maureers okay,
just takes her anger
out on herself.

07:30.817 --> 07:32.182
Who doesn't?

07:32.251 --> 07:34.082
Says her brother's smart.

07:34.153 --> 07:36.314
One genius in a family
is enough.

07:36.789 --> 07:39.349
And there was
a problem at home.

07:39.425 --> 07:41.188
Something about her father.

07:41.260 --> 07:42.352
Is that a problem?

07:42.428 --> 07:44.896
Half the kids in America
don't get along
with their parents.

07:44.964 --> 07:48.263
Not like this.
Maureers run away
a couple of times.

07:48.334 --> 07:51.360
She won't tell me.
She might have told Mitchell.

07:51.437 --> 07:55.464
What am I hearing?
Daddy was a little too close
to the daughter?

07:55.575 --> 07:58.601
Could make her run away,
look for protection.

07:58.744 --> 08:02.043
Mitchell had
a scream-out with Dad.
Dad called the cops.

08:02.114 --> 08:04.708
Myself, I needed help,
I wouldn't pick Mitchell.

08:04.784 --> 08:07.082
No, we'll pick him.
For today, at least.

08:07.153 --> 08:08.586
Where can we find him?

08:09.055 --> 08:11.250
(Maureen)
They don't need me at home.

08:11.591 --> 08:12.751
[Sighing]

08:12.825 --> 08:15.191
Your dad was killed
last night.

08:15.628 --> 08:17.528
I don't have
to be home to cry.

08:17.597 --> 08:21.226
She don't need you
for nothing.
She needs you, though, Mitch.

08:21.767 --> 08:23.735
Just so she can get
busted again.

08:23.803 --> 08:26.533
(Briscoe)
Where were you last night?
With me.

08:26.606 --> 08:29.541
Till I got home.
You taking me in?

08:29.742 --> 08:33.803
'Cause we're going back
to the crib,
and you ain't invited. Later.

08:34.280 --> 08:36.009
dd <i>[music playing]</i>

08:37.850 --> 08:39.078
[Sighing]

08:39.418 --> 08:42.216
I'm sorry,
I don't know what
this is about.

08:42.288 --> 08:45.257
We understand that Mitch
didn't get along
with your husband.

08:45.324 --> 08:47.349
No, Frank didn't like him.

08:47.727 --> 08:49.957
We never thought
he was right for Maureen.

08:50.029 --> 08:52.293
Look, is all this necessary?

08:52.365 --> 08:53.923
My sister really
needs her rest.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.299
We happen to know that
Maureen ran away a few times.

08:58.437 --> 09:02.134
So if there's anything
you want to tell us,
I think now is the time.

09:02.441 --> 09:05.410
Wait.
You think Mitch killed Frank?

09:05.978 --> 09:08.310
I mean,
they argued a couple of times,
but <i>...</i>

09:08.381 --> 09:09.439
What about?

09:09.515 --> 09:13.474
I told you.
Frank wanted Maureen
to stop seeing him.

09:13.586 --> 09:16.521
All right, now.
Your daughter says
he was with her last night.

09:16.589 --> 09:18.989
Could there be a reason
that she'd protect him?

09:19.058 --> 09:21.390
Good Lord,
she thinks she loves the kid.

09:21.460 --> 09:23.360
Even if he killed her father?

09:24.697 --> 09:26.062
[Stammers]

09:28.267 --> 09:29.859
I don't know.

09:34.140 --> 09:37.837
I can't talk about this.
I just don't know
what she'd do.

09:38.144 --> 09:39.873
Gentlemen, please.

09:41.180 --> 09:42.909
Is your son around?

09:44.350 --> 09:47.080
With a friend. Sandy Resnick.

09:47.787 --> 09:51.314
She lives over on
Central Park West, 341.

09:53.793 --> 09:57.627
You should leave Sean alone.
He has an important
chem test tomorrow.

09:57.697 --> 09:59.289
He's studying?

09:59.532 --> 10:03.400
His father was just murdered.
His father wanted him
to study.

10:03.769 --> 10:05.669
He has early admission
at Princeton.

10:05.738 --> 10:08.571
He fails chem, they might
withdraw the acceptance.

10:08.874 --> 10:12.310
Hey, my mom just called.
What's this about my sister?

10:12.478 --> 10:14.446
You know her boyfriend?

10:15.247 --> 10:16.578
Mitch.

10:16.682 --> 10:18.343
Well, yeah, I met him.

10:18.417 --> 10:20.214
Yeah, you see him
last night?

10:22.655 --> 10:24.919
Oh, no. I know what you guys
are thinking,

10:24.991 --> 10:26.481
but that kid?
I mean, he <i>...</i>

10:26.559 --> 10:29.926
He couldn't have done it.
We heard he was angry
at your dad.

10:30.763 --> 10:32.253
Yeah, but <i>...</i>

10:32.331 --> 10:34.060
No, I don't think so.

10:34.133 --> 10:35.600
(Logan)
Sean, let me
ask you something.

10:35.668 --> 10:37.693
You were in your room
studying.

10:37.770 --> 10:39.499
Your father's outside
having a fight...

10:39.572 --> 10:42.006
but your window's
right on the alley...

10:42.074 --> 10:43.974
and you didn't hear anything?

10:44.477 --> 10:47.105
Look, I don't know
why you guys are doing this,
but...

10:47.179 --> 10:50.012
I was in the kitchen awhile
and the radio was on.

10:51.150 --> 10:53.618
I'd have gone out
if I'd heard something.

10:55.621 --> 10:57.885
Yeah.
Good luck on that test.

11:00.760 --> 11:01.784
[Briscoe sighing]

11:01.861 --> 11:04.159
Holes just keep
getting bigger.

11:04.230 --> 11:06.926
The mother says maybe
the daughter's boyfriend
did it...

11:06.999 --> 11:08.591
but she won't give you
enough to move.

11:08.668 --> 11:11.501
Yeah, and admit her husband's
doing their daughter?

11:11.570 --> 11:14.801
We gave her a chance.
She'll dance on his grave
before she tells us.

11:14.874 --> 11:17.069
Hell, she'll jump in it
before she tells us.

11:17.143 --> 11:21.045
Something here doesn't play.
Loved by his tenants.
Sweetest guy on earth.

11:21.113 --> 11:23.707
Is that the picture of a guy
who molests his child?

11:23.783 --> 11:26.377
None of this plays.
McKinnors Mr. Clean...

11:26.452 --> 11:29.387
he doesn't take tips,
lives in a basement apartment.

11:29.455 --> 11:32.481
How's he afford to pay
prep school tuition
for the kid?

11:32.558 --> 11:36.358
We don't know enough
about this man.
Let's ask somebody who might.

11:40.199 --> 11:44.101
I own that building 16 years.
Frank McKinnors
been with me 11.

11:45.137 --> 11:47.571
Anybody that honest,
you got to wonder.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.608
That's a lovely view
of human nature.

11:49.675 --> 11:52.644
Calling a Super crooked
is like calling the sky blue.

11:53.012 --> 11:54.104
McKinnon?

11:54.180 --> 11:55.977
He wouldn't steal
cheese from a rat.

11:56.048 --> 11:58.573
Sounds like he's practically
a friend of the Tooth Fairy's.

11:58.651 --> 12:00.380
He was soft on the tenants.

12:00.453 --> 12:02.785
He fixes things
they should have paid for.

12:02.855 --> 12:04.447
The only thing
I worried about...

12:04.523 --> 12:06.320
liability insurance.
I wondered.

12:06.392 --> 12:07.984
Maybe he drank a little bit.

12:08.060 --> 12:10.494
So did I,
but it didn't make me
a bad insurance risk.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.724
Bet you didn't break
as many bones as he did.

12:12.798 --> 12:14.629
What?
Accidents.

12:15.067 --> 12:16.591
Four, five times
in the hospital.

12:16.669 --> 12:18.830
I mean, it's got to be
the bottle, right?

12:18.904 --> 12:20.428
Which hospital?

12:20.773 --> 12:24.072
February, cracked collarbone.
He slipped on the ice.

12:24.143 --> 12:27.943
April, steam from the boiler.
First degree burns
on his back.

12:28.414 --> 12:30.575
Who stands backwards
at a boiler that long?

12:30.649 --> 12:32.708
The admitting nurse
wanted to know, too.

12:32.785 --> 12:36.050
Cooked that bad,
he'd have to be against
a hot pipe a good minute.

12:36.122 --> 12:39.523
July, he's in again.
Cracked ribs.
Fell off a ladder.

12:39.592 --> 12:40.923
I admitted him.

12:40.993 --> 12:45.054
If that man fell off a ladder,
then I got hit by a truck
and stubbed my toe.

12:45.131 --> 12:46.792
Well, people do
fall off of ladders.

12:46.866 --> 12:48.766
I mean, I might crack
a couple of ribs.

12:48.834 --> 12:52.395
Mr. McKinnon had no bruises.
No scratches. Just the ribs.

12:52.471 --> 12:56.134
I asked him,
"Somebody hurting you?"
He was polite enough.

12:56.208 --> 12:58.472
But he said I should
mind my own business.

12:58.544 --> 13:02.139
Four times in 18 months.
Nobody is that accident-prone.

13:06.952 --> 13:11.013
All I know is somebody
killed my husband and
you can't tell me who did it.

13:12.091 --> 13:14.423
All right,
did your husband
have any friends...

13:14.493 --> 13:17.690
or business associates
who had a reason
to put him in the hospital?

13:17.763 --> 13:19.355
You calling my father
some sort of criminal?

13:19.431 --> 13:20.420
Sean.

13:21.133 --> 13:23.067
My husband worked hard.

13:23.502 --> 13:26.300
5:00 in the morning
till 10:00,11:00 at night.

13:26.372 --> 13:28.033
He was tired,
he had accidents.

13:28.107 --> 13:31.508
But you think your daughter's
boyfriend had a grudge
against your husband, right?

13:31.577 --> 13:33.602
I didn't say that. You did.

13:36.515 --> 13:38.574
(Catherine)
Do you have
any more questions?

13:38.651 --> 13:41.745
We have to make arrangements
for my husband's funeral.

13:44.757 --> 13:47.225
[Cars honking]

13:47.293 --> 13:49.693
You know, all we got is
a bunch of hunches...

13:49.762 --> 13:51.730
and an accident-prone
dead guy.

13:51.797 --> 13:54.231
Yeah, I think we got
the wrong hunch.

13:54.300 --> 13:57.929
Maureers boyfriend
had one lousy fight
with her father.

13:58.003 --> 14:00.096
That's a long way
from killing him.

14:00.172 --> 14:03.164
Yeah, two days ago,
the mother steers us
toward the boyfriend.

14:03.242 --> 14:04.436
Two minutes ago,
she backs off.

14:04.510 --> 14:06.375
Sure, she goes along
with anything we say.

14:06.445 --> 14:08.436
She doesn't want us
to get anywhere.

14:08.514 --> 14:11.540
You know what else bothers me?
Both kids.

14:11.851 --> 14:14.445
Their father gets
his skull crushed.
Where are they?

14:14.520 --> 14:16.420
She's off with
Mr. Juvenile Record.

14:16.488 --> 14:18.649
He's at his girlfriend's,
studying.

14:18.724 --> 14:22.558
Who in hell studies for a test
the day after
your father is killed?

14:22.628 --> 14:24.926
You got trouble
with this kid?
What?

14:24.997 --> 14:26.328
I mean, you're both Irish.

14:26.398 --> 14:27.729
You made it
as far as detective...

14:27.800 --> 14:29.631
he's making it all the way
to the lvy League.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.533
Hey, the trouble I have
with this kid is...

14:31.604 --> 14:33.196
he was the only one home
when it happened.

14:33.272 --> 14:34.705
Let's work this through.

14:34.773 --> 14:37.936
They say somebody broke in.
We say maybe nobody broke in.

14:39.011 --> 14:40.808
You see the problem?

14:45.217 --> 14:47.913
Nat Horowitz fights with his
brother-in-law all the time.

14:47.987 --> 14:49.511
I don't know, I just assumed.

14:49.588 --> 14:52.148
But it was definitely
two voices.
Mers voices.

14:52.224 --> 14:55.159
Well, I really wasrt
paying attention.
I think it was two.

14:55.227 --> 14:56.888
One was shouting
really loud.

14:56.962 --> 14:59.396
Mrs. Kroll, are you sure
you didn't hear
any words clearly?

14:59.465 --> 15:03.026
No, just shouting.
Later, they were throwing
things at each other.

15:03.102 --> 15:06.299
Elaine Horowitz told me
last year Nat threw a lamp.

15:06.372 --> 15:08.340
This time,
it sounded like glass.

15:08.407 --> 15:11.740
Wait a minute.
Now, you didn't say anything
about glass breaking.

15:11.810 --> 15:14.438
Well, it was about
half an hour later.

15:14.513 --> 15:17.107
I was on the fire stairs
in the back hallway.

15:17.182 --> 15:19.548
My husband won't let me smoke
in the apartment.

15:19.618 --> 15:22.485
Mrs. Kroll,
I'm gonna run this by you
one more time.

15:22.554 --> 15:26.786
You heard shouting.
Then a half-hour later,
you heard glass breaking?

15:26.926 --> 15:29.360
Yes.
I thought it was Horowitz.

15:30.529 --> 15:32.394
Is the woman reliable?

15:32.464 --> 15:35.991
Unless she was smoking dope
on those back steps
instead of cigarettes.

15:36.068 --> 15:38.662
(Briscoe)
Yeah, I don't think she lost
track of half an hour.

15:38.737 --> 15:41.865
And I don't think anybody
beat him up and then broke in.

15:41.941 --> 15:44.409
Well, fellas,
I'll buy no burglars.

15:44.710 --> 15:46.109
In fact...

15:46.845 --> 15:49.245
I'll buy there was
no one there at all.

15:51.784 --> 15:54.719
Somebody stop me
before the train crashes.

15:55.487 --> 15:58.945
We're about to say
Frank McKinnon was killed
by his own son.

15:59.024 --> 16:00.389
I won't stop you.

16:00.459 --> 16:03.257
I just want to know
who smashed the window.

16:04.196 --> 16:05.493
No question.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.490
This glass was knocked out.
From the inside.

16:08.567 --> 16:12.333
You just discovered this?
I'm not Columbus.
I wasrt looking.

16:12.404 --> 16:14.770
Ask me sooner,
I find it sooner.

16:14.873 --> 16:16.636
Glass is tensile.

16:17.042 --> 16:18.907
You want to know
which side it was hit from...

16:18.978 --> 16:21.412
match a piece on the ground
with one left in the frame...

16:21.480 --> 16:23.141
check for radial fractures.

16:23.215 --> 16:25.877
So, the kid broke the window,
realized he screwed up...

16:25.951 --> 16:27.851
and then moved
the glass back inside.

16:27.920 --> 16:30.252
And, got some of his
father's blood on it.

16:30.322 --> 16:34.349
Kills his old man,
cleans it up and waits
for Mom to come home.

16:34.560 --> 16:36.050
That is cold.

16:36.962 --> 16:39.795
Yeah, but Dad was
in the boiler room. Now...

16:39.865 --> 16:43.699
why would he go outside
to stop a break-in
that didn't happen?

16:44.003 --> 16:46.904
What's the basement floor
made of?
Cement.

16:47.139 --> 16:49.937
Get us a guy with Luminol.
We're gonna spray.

16:51.477 --> 16:52.603
[Whirring]

16:52.678 --> 16:53.940
(Logan)
Well...

16:54.013 --> 16:56.106
I guess that's not
cranberry juice.

16:56.181 --> 16:57.648
(Granger)
Straight line.

16:57.716 --> 17:00.014
(Granger)
He was dragged the whole way.

17:03.589 --> 17:05.284
Dead end, fellas.

17:06.692 --> 17:08.387
Spray the pipe.

17:09.395 --> 17:10.794
[Whirring]

17:11.096 --> 17:12.324
Right.

17:14.933 --> 17:16.093
Well...

17:17.202 --> 17:19.602
he hits him here,
drags him out.

17:20.973 --> 17:22.906
You think the mother knows?

17:23.575 --> 17:24.973
I don't know.

17:25.044 --> 17:28.444
But did you notice
the daughter the last time
we were in the building?

17:28.513 --> 17:31.005
Unappy.
And scared.

17:34.620 --> 17:38.249
You keep coming after me.
I was with my boyfriend.
I don't know anything.

17:38.323 --> 17:41.258
Okay, look,
all we want to know is
what happened to your father.

17:41.326 --> 17:44.386
We don't think you
or your boyfriend
had anything to do with it.

17:44.463 --> 17:46.954
I'm gonna ask you a question,
okay?

17:47.332 --> 17:49.892
Did your brother
get along with your father?

17:50.369 --> 17:52.599
Did they ever
fight sometimes?

17:53.205 --> 17:55.002
I don't know
what you mean.

17:55.374 --> 17:59.276
Well, he was there that night.
But he says
he didn't hear anything.

17:59.344 --> 18:01.574
He said
he was in the kitchen.

18:02.881 --> 18:05.008
Maybe he wasrt
telling the truth.

18:06.752 --> 18:08.549
What do you think
happened?

18:10.656 --> 18:13.250
I don't...
You know what I think?

18:14.059 --> 18:16.323
I think you don't
believe him either.

18:17.029 --> 18:18.997
Look, it doesn't matter.

18:19.064 --> 18:21.692
My father is dead,
so just leave us alone.

18:24.403 --> 18:25.529
[Door bangs]

18:28.941 --> 18:29.965
[Sighing]

18:30.042 --> 18:32.943
This has been very hard
for my sister and the kids.

18:33.512 --> 18:35.605
Oh, please, sit down.

18:39.017 --> 18:40.951
I'm sure that Catherine...

18:41.019 --> 18:43.010
you know,
told you everything she knows.

18:43.088 --> 18:46.148
All due respect to you,
we don't think
that's the case.

18:47.726 --> 18:49.785
What are you suggesting?

18:49.962 --> 18:54.456
I'm suggesting that
Mr. McKinnon was in the
hospital four times last year.

18:55.801 --> 18:58.531
Was your sister's husband
a violent man?

18:58.604 --> 18:59.662
No.

19:00.639 --> 19:02.231
(Logan)
How about Sean?

19:02.941 --> 19:04.568
He ever hit his father?

19:06.345 --> 19:09.280
Well, I mean, you know,
once in a while <i>...</i>

19:10.082 --> 19:13.051
You know how families are.
Tempers flare, you know.

19:13.118 --> 19:16.281
Where I come from,
it was the father
who used the strap.

19:25.764 --> 19:26.890
[Mumbles]

19:29.768 --> 19:33.067
There was this reception,
the Princeton Club.

19:34.206 --> 19:36.970
It was for applicants
and their parents.

19:38.076 --> 19:40.567
I went in Frank's place.

19:41.780 --> 19:44.214
Catherine said I'd make
a good impression...

19:44.283 --> 19:46.080
because I'm an accountant.

19:47.986 --> 19:49.954
When we got home that night...

19:50.422 --> 19:52.890
Frank was upset.

19:54.159 --> 19:56.855
He said,
"I'm a Super and proud of it."

19:57.996 --> 20:01.454
And Sean said, "Oh, a Super.
That would really
help me get in."

20:02.201 --> 20:03.930
Frank was shouting.

20:05.837 --> 20:07.862
Sean told him to shut up.

20:10.442 --> 20:13.411
And then,
Frank went right over
to the boy...

20:14.079 --> 20:17.014
right in his face
and he said, "Go ahead...

20:17.316 --> 20:20.513
"do it in front of your uncle.
Take a pop at me.

20:21.653 --> 20:24.349
"Let him see what this family
is really about."

20:26.358 --> 20:28.553
Sean was gonna hit him.

20:31.363 --> 20:33.331
I had to separate them.

20:33.765 --> 20:36.563
I thought you said
your sister told us the truth.

20:41.240 --> 20:44.073
Yeah, well,
maybe I'm not as sure
as I used to be.

20:49.381 --> 20:52.214
Broken collarbone,
cracked ribs.

20:52.618 --> 20:55.280
You were beating him up
pretty regular, werert you?

20:55.354 --> 20:57.845
Let's give the kid
a chance, Lennie.

20:58.690 --> 21:00.885
Maybe you can explain this,
Sean.

21:02.027 --> 21:03.688
You think I hit my own father?

21:03.762 --> 21:06.094
We heard you almost hit him
in front of your uncle.

21:06.164 --> 21:09.031
What he do this time, huh?
Something must have
made you mad.

21:09.101 --> 21:12.468
I don't know
what you're talking about.
Somebody broke in.

21:12.537 --> 21:14.164
No, actually, Sean,
nobody did.

21:14.239 --> 21:15.866
You see,
what happened was this.

21:15.941 --> 21:19.877
Somebody dragged his body out
from the boiler room outside.

21:20.245 --> 21:22.236
(Briscoe)
You didn't like your old man,
did you?

21:22.314 --> 21:24.646
Why? 'Cause he was a Super?
'Cause he didn't
go to Princeton?

21:24.716 --> 21:25.842
I loved my father.

21:25.917 --> 21:28.147
(Logan)
Well, maybe you can tell us
about the broken window

21:28.220 --> 21:29.551
'cause it turns out...

21:29.621 --> 21:31.953
somebody knocked it out
from the inside.

21:32.024 --> 21:35.118
That doesn't sound
like a burglary to me.
You know what I mean?

21:35.193 --> 21:36.592
(Briscoe)
Pretty smart move, Sean.

21:36.662 --> 21:39.460
But you didn't know
we could prove that, did you?

21:40.198 --> 21:41.631
Gentlemen...

21:42.467 --> 21:44.697
Roger Easton, Sears lawyer.

21:44.770 --> 21:45.998
What's he doing here?

21:46.071 --> 21:48.562
Well, for openers,
we think he killed his father.

21:48.640 --> 21:49.834
(Easton)
Under pressure here?

21:49.908 --> 21:53.275
You can't find
the street scum who did it,
so you go after this boy?

21:53.345 --> 21:54.903
I want him out of here, now.

21:54.980 --> 21:58.347
Take a break, Counselor.
Maybe, we'll give you a ride
to central booking.

21:58.417 --> 21:59.577
Mike.

22:04.323 --> 22:07.349
Parents beating their kids
is pretty common.
But the other way around?

22:07.426 --> 22:10.327
How often does that happen?
So this kid's
the exception to the rule.

22:10.395 --> 22:14.195
He's ashamed of his father?
As a motive, it sounds like
sidewalk psychology to me.

22:14.266 --> 22:16.734
Look, I don't care
what it sounds like.
You don't buy the motive?

22:16.802 --> 22:19.236
Go with the physical evidence.
Who broke that window?

22:19.304 --> 22:21.795
Who the hell dragged
McKinnors body
down that hall?

22:21.873 --> 22:24.808
The physical evidence
makes me ready
to believe the motive.

22:24.876 --> 22:27.743
Even if I am ready
to believe it,
I don't know if a jury is.

22:27.813 --> 22:29.804
We have enough to indict.

22:33.785 --> 22:35.514
Okay. Go ahead.

22:40.992 --> 22:42.323
Sean McKinnon...

22:42.394 --> 22:45.522
you're under arrest for
the murder of Frank McKinnon.
Excuse me.

22:45.597 --> 22:47.258
You have the right
to remain silent.

22:47.332 --> 22:49.095
Anything you do, say,
can and will be...

22:49.167 --> 22:51.328
used against you
in a court of law.

22:53.538 --> 22:56.735

"Docket number 680641...

22:57.342 --> 23:00.539

<i>of New York v. Sean McKinnon.</i>

23:03.882 --> 23:05.782
How does the defendant plead?

23:06.918 --> 23:08.545
Not guilty, sir.

23:09.221 --> 23:10.449
All right.

23:10.522 --> 23:13.389
Young man,
nobody calls me sir anymore.

23:13.458 --> 23:14.482
Ms. Kincaid?

23:14.559 --> 23:16.493
The People request
reasonable bail.

23:16.561 --> 23:19.428
While there's
no risk of flight...
There's also no record.

23:19.498 --> 23:22.990
Bail is to secure appearance
at trial, Ms. Kincaid,
not to punish.

23:23.068 --> 23:24.262
(Judge Franks)
Mr. Easton?

23:24.336 --> 23:27.237
Your Honor, the McKinnon
family have limited means.

23:27.305 --> 23:29.671
High bail would be
a terrible hardship.

23:29.741 --> 23:32.574
Death was a terrible hardship
for the victim.

23:32.644 --> 23:35.340
Meanwhile, your client
looks quite respectable.

23:35.414 --> 23:39.043
You'll get a bond.
$50,000, short date. Next?

23:39.584 --> 23:42.519
You're making a mistake.
The boy's a victim.

23:43.488 --> 23:47.549
Sir, he's walking around
and his father
is six feet under.

23:48.160 --> 23:51.823
Mrs. McKinnon is prepared
to admit that her son
killed her husband.

23:54.966 --> 23:56.433
[Catherine mumbles]

23:57.469 --> 23:59.437
I tried to stop him.

24:01.807 --> 24:03.707
It's a couple of years now.

24:05.577 --> 24:08.045
Sean was only
defending himself.

24:08.847 --> 24:11.975
Your husband was
abusing your son?
He hit him.

24:13.485 --> 24:15.453
He hit me, sometimes...

24:16.254 --> 24:17.687
my daughter.

24:19.391 --> 24:22.155
My husband was
a very angry man.

24:25.831 --> 24:27.298
Sean says <i>...</i>

24:28.433 --> 24:29.866
He told me...

24:30.001 --> 24:31.764
he was studying...

24:33.772 --> 24:36.707
and his father was
in one of those moods.

24:38.610 --> 24:40.237
He came after him.

24:40.312 --> 24:43.372
Mrs. McKinnon,
when did your son
tell you this?

24:43.615 --> 24:47.016
Ben, this is not
the time to look
for an accessory charge.

24:47.085 --> 24:49.781
(Catherine)
I couldn't believe
Sean had done it.

24:51.189 --> 24:53.384
When he told me, I knew...

24:54.726 --> 24:56.489
that I was at fault.

24:58.897 --> 25:01.024
I should have stopped Frank.

25:01.967 --> 25:04.128
He picked on Sean so much.

25:04.436 --> 25:06.097
Her husband was abusive.

25:06.304 --> 25:08.898
Mr. McKinnon was
in the hospital several times.

25:08.974 --> 25:11.101
For God's sake, so was Sean.

25:15.046 --> 25:16.673
He broke his arm.

25:16.848 --> 25:18.645
His father broke his arm.

25:20.118 --> 25:24.111
We told the doctor
it was a bike accident.
He fell off his bike.

25:25.257 --> 25:27.452
Sean was supposed
to go to Europe...

25:27.526 --> 25:29.858
he sang with
a group at school.

25:30.161 --> 25:31.753
His father beat him...

25:32.330 --> 25:34.025
he was black and blue...

25:34.299 --> 25:35.698
he couldn't go.

25:35.767 --> 25:37.530
He gave him a black eye.

25:38.803 --> 25:40.703
We lied and said...

25:41.473 --> 25:43.703
it was an accident.
Basketball.

25:48.513 --> 25:50.310
(Schiff)
Pity the poor child.

25:51.449 --> 25:53.883
It's a good defense,
and it works.

25:54.452 --> 25:57.478
There is the possibility
that she's telling the truth.

25:57.556 --> 25:58.989
You didn't even
want an arrest.

25:59.057 --> 26:01.025
I hadrt met
Catherine McKinnon.

26:01.092 --> 26:02.957
It was weird.
When you went out
with Easton...

26:03.094 --> 26:05.289
she kept saying how sad
it was for her son.

26:05.363 --> 26:06.887
But she never mentioned
her husband.

26:06.965 --> 26:08.865
Not even to complain
about him.

26:08.934 --> 26:11.596
I don't believe her.
(Schiff)
She's not on trial.

26:11.670 --> 26:13.638
And if she's lying,
they trumped us.

26:13.705 --> 26:17.232
But if she's not lying,
I don't want to prosecute
an abused child.

26:17.309 --> 26:19.174
Now,
why didn't she go for help?

26:19.244 --> 26:22.213
An abusive father,
he can hold
an entire family hostage...

26:22.280 --> 26:25.113
but an abusive son?
No, she'd have
called somebody.

26:25.183 --> 26:27.208
(Kincaid)
Sean McKinnon almost
hit his father...

26:27.285 --> 26:30.254
in front of his uncle.
Now, that wasrt self-defense.

26:30.922 --> 26:32.321
What do you think?

26:33.725 --> 26:35.192
You want a deal?

26:35.260 --> 26:38.423
You tell Easton,
the kid has to see Olivet.

26:38.763 --> 26:40.492
Are you so convinced
he's guilty?

26:40.565 --> 26:42.556
Check the mother's story.

26:42.634 --> 26:45.228
And see if that kid
was also in the hospital.

26:51.076 --> 26:53.169
I never thought
I'd hit him back.

26:53.712 --> 26:55.543
(Olivet)
How do you feel now?

26:58.750 --> 27:00.547
I don't know. I mean...

27:00.986 --> 27:03.079
what do you want me to say?

27:03.521 --> 27:04.852
I feel bad?

27:06.458 --> 27:08.983
Okay, I mean, I feel bad.

27:10.128 --> 27:11.595
He was my father.

27:12.364 --> 27:13.991
I'm sorry.

27:15.967 --> 27:17.867
I didn't want this to happen.

27:18.403 --> 27:19.700
I know.

27:27.312 --> 27:28.973
When he beat me...

27:30.649 --> 27:32.344
he was shouting...

27:34.119 --> 27:35.381
about...

27:37.856 --> 27:40.222
how I didn't respect him.
And about <i>...</i>

27:43.428 --> 27:47.023
About how I never brought
friends home 'cause he was
only a Super.

27:47.999 --> 27:49.796
He didn't understand.

27:51.436 --> 27:54.303
The way he let
those tenants treat him.
I mean...

27:54.606 --> 27:58.565
he lived in the basement,
as if that was all
you should have.

28:00.378 --> 28:02.744
Do you think he was
ashamed of himself?

28:03.515 --> 28:05.107
He thought I was
ashamed, but...

28:05.183 --> 28:07.743
he was projecting.
I didn't care. I just <i>...</i>

28:09.320 --> 28:11.515
I just wanted him
to be proud of me.

28:12.457 --> 28:13.822
Well, was he?

28:16.027 --> 28:17.494
No, he wasrt.

28:17.562 --> 28:19.723
It didn't matter
how hard I worked.
I mean, I <i>...</i>

28:19.798 --> 28:23.700
I got into Princeton
and everybody else was happy,
except him.

28:24.969 --> 28:27.267
He was depressed.
He was angry.

28:27.972 --> 28:29.439
Why was that?

28:31.643 --> 28:32.735
He said...

28:33.078 --> 28:35.478
I thought
I was better than him.

28:38.817 --> 28:40.512
And then a week after...

28:41.086 --> 28:44.317
he showed up at school
in work clothes. I mean...

28:45.090 --> 28:46.990
you don't do that at Deardon.

28:49.561 --> 28:51.153
Did that matter to you?

28:54.966 --> 28:55.955
No.

28:57.335 --> 28:58.927
Oh, no. I just <i>...</i>

29:00.004 --> 29:01.528
I wanted to be different,
you know.

29:01.673 --> 29:03.664
I just wanted
a different life.

29:05.810 --> 29:07.072
I wanted more.

29:08.246 --> 29:11.010
It's a great act,
but he's a sociopath.

29:11.149 --> 29:13.640
An ounce of doubt,
I wouldn't testify.

29:13.718 --> 29:17.245
Liz, the son
beats the father up
and the mother does nothing?

29:17.322 --> 29:19.017
The woman is probably
paralyzed.

29:19.090 --> 29:22.491
If she admits how bad it is,
she has to admit
she raised a monster.

29:22.560 --> 29:24.653
Then maybe we should be
prosecuting her.

29:24.729 --> 29:27.163
She's in denial.
She wants to keep
her family together.

29:27.232 --> 29:28.722
Like with alcoholics.

29:28.800 --> 29:31.928
Daddy passes out over dinner,
we pretend he's just tired.

29:32.437 --> 29:36.430
The cops were right.
The McKinnons had a secret.
They just got the wrong one.

29:36.508 --> 29:38.271
I wish I could be
as sure as you are.

29:38.343 --> 29:40.470
Why don't you
want it to be true?

29:42.413 --> 29:44.005
Am I the patient here?

29:44.115 --> 29:45.605
Ben, you're not alone.

29:45.683 --> 29:48.914
None of us want
to believe that kids
beat up their parents.

29:50.755 --> 29:53.417
Do you think that the father
ever hit the kid?

29:53.591 --> 29:56.253
It would make it easier
to deal with, wouldn't it?

29:56.327 --> 29:58.488
I think this kid doesn't
want to be who he is...

29:58.563 --> 30:01.054
and every time he looks
at his father, he's reminded.

30:01.132 --> 30:05.034
Maybe Mom sent him a message,
the father's no good.
So, he takes over.

30:05.103 --> 30:07.867
Do you know what he told me?
He pays the bills.

30:08.039 --> 30:11.998
How many 17-year-olds
do you know who take care
of their family finances?

30:12.110 --> 30:13.372
I don't know.

30:13.611 --> 30:14.839
Is it that important?

30:14.913 --> 30:16.710
It's a textbook sign.

30:17.916 --> 30:20.214
<i>Journal of</i>
<i>Family Dysfunction.</i>

30:21.786 --> 30:26.450
"In most cases, the adolescent
is ashamed of a parent's
lack of social status.

30:26.558 --> 30:29.118
"The child commonly takes over
parental functions...

30:29.194 --> 30:31.992
"determining how money
is spent and paying bills.

30:32.063 --> 30:34.793
"The parents,
fearing the child, acquiesce."

30:35.733 --> 30:38.429
A million cases a year
of parent abuse.

30:38.636 --> 30:41.104
I can't tell you why
it happened in this family.

30:41.172 --> 30:45.370
But I do know that
Sean McKinnon has enough anger
to blow this office apart.

30:46.644 --> 30:48.043
[Knocking on door]

30:52.050 --> 30:54.883
The McKinnons are
playing the press.
Guess what?

30:54.953 --> 30:56.511
The father's the villain.

30:56.588 --> 30:58.180
That's what
they'll do in court.

30:58.256 --> 31:00.690
Sean McKinnon will make
his own best witness.

31:00.758 --> 31:03.158
The hospital only has X-rays
of Sears broken arm.

31:03.228 --> 31:05.822
They don't prove
how it happened.
And the black eye?

31:05.897 --> 31:07.558
Two stitches,
they sent him home.

31:07.632 --> 31:09.930
She told us that her husband
hit the kid, right?

31:10.001 --> 31:12.902
She told the hospital
that it was a basketball game.

31:13.238 --> 31:16.332
So, let's find out
who he plays ball with, okay?

31:16.875 --> 31:18.604
If we'd known Sears dad
was beating him...

31:18.676 --> 31:20.234
I mean, maybe we could have
helped him.

31:20.311 --> 31:21.676
We all feel
really bad about it.

31:21.746 --> 31:23.304
Oh, he never told you?

31:24.015 --> 31:26.381
No. Sean never talked
about his father.

31:26.651 --> 31:28.516
I guess now we know why.

31:28.586 --> 31:30.417
Why are you asking me
about this?

31:30.488 --> 31:32.820
I mean,
my coach said something
about me hitting him?

31:32.891 --> 31:35.689
Last June,
when he got a black eye?

31:36.394 --> 31:37.554
[Stammers]

31:38.263 --> 31:40.390
That was an accident.

31:40.732 --> 31:42.529
We were playing one-on-one.

31:43.167 --> 31:46.193
His mother claims that
his dad gave him
the black eye.

31:47.205 --> 31:48.194
No.

31:48.373 --> 31:51.536
No, it was me.
I mean, I was sorry,
but I did it.

31:53.378 --> 31:56.677
It swelled up.
He went to the emergency room
at St. Mary's.

31:56.748 --> 31:58.682
Did Sean say
it didn't happen?

31:59.751 --> 32:00.911
Catherine McKinnon lied.

32:00.985 --> 32:05.217
Yeah, she'll testify
that she was confused.
It was another black eye.

32:05.523 --> 32:07.354
(Stone)
This whole story
plays both ways.

32:07.425 --> 32:09.757
The father had accidents...

32:09.827 --> 32:12.625
the son was abused.
Or the other way around.

32:12.697 --> 32:15.928
But the father's not here
to defend himself.
So a jury...

32:16.000 --> 32:19.163
could give this kid
a college going-away party.

32:19.237 --> 32:21.728
(Schiff)
He kills his father,
mother defends him.

32:21.806 --> 32:24.001
Doesrt the sister
have a stake in this?

32:24.075 --> 32:26.908
Well, we scheduled her
for a statement,
she didn't come in.

32:26.978 --> 32:29.674
She's staying at her uncle's.
Should I try again?

32:29.747 --> 32:31.078
(Stone)
Why?
She never did anything before.

32:31.149 --> 32:33.117
Why should she start now?

32:33.484 --> 32:36.544
Before her father
was just bruised.
Now he's buried.

32:37.522 --> 32:39.786
She wouldn't be comfortable
at home right now.

32:39.857 --> 32:40.846
I see.

32:40.959 --> 32:42.893
She's having nightmares.

32:44.462 --> 32:46.020
I don't want to
talk to you.

32:46.097 --> 32:50.466
Maureen, your mom says
Sean had to protect
you from your father.

32:50.535 --> 32:52.127
Now is that true?

32:54.038 --> 32:56.836
Your mom says
your father hit all of you.

32:57.542 --> 32:59.476
Mom wouldn't say that
about Dad.

32:59.544 --> 33:01.876
Honey,
why would she make that up?

33:03.181 --> 33:06.708
What did you let her
in here for?
Did your father ever hit you?

33:09.787 --> 33:12.620
I wish I could tell you,
but I wasrt there.

33:13.958 --> 33:15.789
Yeah, why werert you there?

33:16.494 --> 33:18.257
Why wasrt somebody there?

33:18.663 --> 33:21.029
I'm sorry, Maureen.
I should have been.

33:21.833 --> 33:23.198
Maureen...

33:23.568 --> 33:26.230
your mother and your brother
say your father beat you.

33:26.304 --> 33:28.772
No!
And that's why
you got into trouble.

33:29.073 --> 33:30.870
It was your father's fault.

33:31.242 --> 33:33.540
No. It's not true.

33:33.611 --> 33:37.274
My dad never hit me.
He never hit anybody.
It's not true.

33:37.348 --> 33:38.440
Okay, okay.

33:38.516 --> 33:40.040
[Maureen sobbing]

33:46.157 --> 33:48.125
My daughter's been in trouble.

33:48.192 --> 33:51.252
She has a lot of problems.
Your brother believes her.

33:51.829 --> 33:54.161
He wasrt there
when she was arrested.

33:54.465 --> 33:56.490
He wasrt at
the police station.

33:57.335 --> 33:59.428
He didn't have to
face the neighbors.

33:59.504 --> 34:03.406
Mrs. McKinnon, maybe
what the neighbors think
isn't the issue here.

34:03.508 --> 34:07.410
Please, don't do this to her.
I mean,
I know why she does this.

34:08.045 --> 34:11.174
It's out of her control.
She invented the whole story?

34:12.750 --> 34:14.775
She wasrt doing
so great at school.

34:14.851 --> 34:16.342
So I help her out.

34:16.920 --> 34:20.254
I help her out all the time,
and she resents me for it.

34:20.425 --> 34:21.915
Even my dad said to her...

34:21.993 --> 34:25.224
getting mad at me wouldn't
make up for the things
that she's done wrong.

34:25.295 --> 34:26.922
You let her send
her brother to jail...

34:26.998 --> 34:28.862
she'll live with it
for the rest of her life.

34:28.933 --> 34:32.232
Think what you're
doing to her.
What are you doing to her?

34:33.704 --> 34:35.103
(Easton)
Catherine?

34:37.108 --> 34:39.132
(Catherine)
All Sears hard work.

34:39.710 --> 34:41.302
You're destroying him.

34:42.045 --> 34:44.514
You don't think
he played a part in that?

34:51.889 --> 34:53.049
[Door opens]

34:57.161 --> 34:58.788
You're going to trial?

34:59.764 --> 35:03.222
Who does a jury believe?
A girl with a felony record...

35:03.301 --> 35:05.997
or a young man
brutalized by his father?

35:14.011 --> 35:17.606
When he was admitted,
Mr. McKinnon didn't say
anything right away.

35:18.049 --> 35:21.314
I was ready
to call the police.
And did you call them?

35:21.419 --> 35:24.388
His wife told me not to.
That I was wrong.

35:25.123 --> 35:26.784
That it was an accident.

35:26.858 --> 35:28.519
And how did you
respond to that?

35:28.593 --> 35:32.029
I said,
"Believe what you want.
Somebody hit this man."

35:32.463 --> 35:33.623
Thank you.

35:34.699 --> 35:36.189
Your witness.

35:38.436 --> 35:40.495
Tell us, Dr. Henderson...

35:41.005 --> 35:43.530
are you an expert
in forensic medicine?

35:43.608 --> 35:47.510
The man wasrt
having accidents.
Not in February, not in April.

35:47.578 --> 35:50.376
Please, Doctor.
Just answer the question.

35:51.682 --> 35:53.240
I'm not an expert.

35:53.484 --> 35:57.113
Oh. So, Mr. McKinnon
could have had
these accidents...

35:57.188 --> 35:59.884
the kind that
any building superintendent
might have.

35:59.957 --> 36:01.390
Isn't that possible?

36:02.760 --> 36:04.523
Yes, it's possible.

36:05.396 --> 36:07.921
Thank you.
No further questions.

36:08.933 --> 36:12.630
Catherine left a message
on my machine
and Maureen returned the call.

36:12.703 --> 36:14.364
Her mother's putting
a lot of pressure on her.

36:14.438 --> 36:16.531
Did she go home?
I don't think so.

36:17.141 --> 36:19.735
I argued with her
and she ran out
of the apartment.

36:19.810 --> 36:21.607
All this time,
I knew something was wrong.

36:21.679 --> 36:23.442
She's due to testify
on Monday.

36:23.514 --> 36:25.778
I tried.
I told her I'd always
be there.

36:25.850 --> 36:28.114
That she could live
in my apartment.

36:28.186 --> 36:31.417
Well,
she's been in trouble before.
Where'd she go then?

36:32.590 --> 36:35.024
I'm not gonna do it.
Did your mother call you?

36:35.092 --> 36:36.753
Her brother, too.
Mitch.

36:36.827 --> 36:38.488
Here's the headline,
Counselor.

36:38.563 --> 36:40.053
If she goes
against her brother...

36:40.131 --> 36:42.099
her mother says
she can't come home.

36:42.166 --> 36:43.394
I won't have anybody.

36:43.467 --> 36:45.662
What, are you kicking me
to the curb?

36:45.836 --> 36:47.201
I can't live with you.

36:47.271 --> 36:48.966
You gonna live
with your brother?

36:49.040 --> 36:53.101
He offed your old man.
If you don't do this,
he gets away clean.

36:53.377 --> 36:57.040
Hey, Maureen,
you know what your brother
says about your father.

36:57.281 --> 37:00.148
And that's what people
are always going to believe.

37:00.318 --> 37:02.081
[People chattering]

37:06.891 --> 37:08.984
(Maureen)
He hit him all the time.

37:09.227 --> 37:11.957
Whenever my dad talked back,
Sean would hit him.

37:12.163 --> 37:15.394
(Stone)
Did you tell anyone?
My dad said it would stop.

37:16.300 --> 37:17.597
My mom...

37:18.469 --> 37:22.303
she said it was
my dad's fault.
He picked on Sean.

37:23.374 --> 37:24.864
Was that true?

37:25.710 --> 37:28.838
Dad would do anything
Sean wanted. Anything!

37:29.547 --> 37:33.779
Maureen, we've heard testimony
that last February
your father...

37:33.851 --> 37:35.682
broke his collarbone.

37:36.754 --> 37:38.949
Could you tell us
how that happened?

37:39.957 --> 37:41.185
Sean...

37:41.259 --> 37:44.990
took $200 from my mom
to buy clothes.

37:46.931 --> 37:48.831
My dad said
it was too much...

37:50.167 --> 37:51.566
so Sean hit him.

37:51.969 --> 37:53.402
With a tire iron.

37:54.438 --> 37:58.738
And last April, we heard
that your father was
taken to the hospital...

37:58.809 --> 38:01.710
with a burn on his back.
How did that happen?

38:02.580 --> 38:04.741
There was
a vacant apartment...

38:05.249 --> 38:06.580
upstairs.

38:07.251 --> 38:10.152
And Sean wanted my dad
to ask the landlord for it...

38:11.489 --> 38:14.049
so we wouldn't live
in the basement.

38:14.992 --> 38:16.653
My dad said no.

38:18.729 --> 38:20.492
Sean called him a coward.

38:22.099 --> 38:25.034
He followed him
to the boiler room...

38:27.171 --> 38:29.332
and he pushed him
against a pipe.

38:32.543 --> 38:34.443
And I tried to stop him.

38:35.579 --> 38:37.774
My dad was just screaming...

38:39.450 --> 38:41.350
and Sean just held him there.

38:42.687 --> 38:46.680
Maureen, even then,
you didn't ask
anyone for help. Why?

38:49.393 --> 38:50.883
I was afraid.

38:51.395 --> 38:52.692
Afraid of what?

38:53.464 --> 38:54.829
I don't know.

38:57.401 --> 39:01.394
That Sean would be taken away.
My mom and dad would break up.

39:06.210 --> 39:08.235
I didn't know
what would happen.

39:10.147 --> 39:11.910
Maureen, thank you.

39:13.784 --> 39:15.308
(Stone)
Your witness.

39:21.726 --> 39:24.820
Maureen, do you get along
with your brother?

39:26.297 --> 39:27.286
No.

39:27.365 --> 39:29.299
Isn't it true
you resent your brother?

39:29.367 --> 39:32.427
That you feel he got
everything from your parents
and you got nothing?

39:32.503 --> 39:35.131
No.
So you're not envious of him?

39:35.706 --> 39:37.503
That's hard to understand.

39:39.543 --> 39:42.569
Did you run away from home
several times?

39:42.880 --> 39:44.814
I couldn't stand being there.

39:45.750 --> 39:48.776
I couldn't stand...
Your brother being
so successful.

39:50.988 --> 39:52.717
How much do you hate him?

39:53.157 --> 39:56.183
Enough to invent things
that aren't true?

39:56.293 --> 39:58.193
Enough to make up
these stories?

39:58.262 --> 40:00.355
(Stone)
Objection.
Enough to lie to this court?

40:00.431 --> 40:02.626
Your Honor, he's quietly
badgering the witness.

40:02.700 --> 40:04.031
Sustained.

40:07.071 --> 40:09.437
If your brother goes to jail,
Maureen...

40:09.774 --> 40:12.709
then you get all the attention
that you want,
isn't that right?

40:12.777 --> 40:14.745
Your Honor.
Withdrawn.

40:16.614 --> 40:18.172
No further questions.

40:22.486 --> 40:25.319
I've always said
my husband was a good man.

40:26.023 --> 40:29.925
When your husband was violent,
did you consider
professional help?

40:29.994 --> 40:31.689
A psychiatrist, perhaps?

40:32.997 --> 40:34.624
We wouldn't do that.

40:34.698 --> 40:38.532
Sick people go to them.
My husband wasrt sick.

40:40.538 --> 40:43.769
Did your son
ever hit your husband?

40:44.208 --> 40:46.676
Sean never defended himself.

40:47.378 --> 40:48.777
Only this <i>...</i>

40:50.247 --> 40:51.714
This time.

40:52.583 --> 40:54.312
Thank you, Mrs. McKinnon.

40:55.252 --> 40:56.583
Your witness.

40:56.787 --> 41:00.814
Mrs. McKinnon,
a doctor testified...

41:00.891 --> 41:05.225
that your husband's injuries
were caused by assault
and not by accident.

41:05.830 --> 41:07.195
Is she lying?

41:07.932 --> 41:09.593
Yes, she is lying.

41:10.401 --> 41:14.360
Your daughter said that
your son repeatedly
attacked his father.

41:16.740 --> 41:18.537
Is your own daughter lying?

41:21.846 --> 41:23.575
Yes, she is lying.

41:25.449 --> 41:29.351
Mrs. McKinnon,
isn't it true that your son
took control of your family...

41:29.420 --> 41:31.149
and you couldn't stop him?

41:33.591 --> 41:36.458
And can you give us
one reason to believe...

41:36.527 --> 41:39.985
that these witnesses are lying
and you are telling the truth?

41:43.300 --> 41:44.665
Because <i>...</i>

41:47.037 --> 41:48.971
Because I am his mother.

41:49.039 --> 41:50.870
But isn't that
all the more reason...

41:50.941 --> 41:53.569
for you to say anything at all
to protect him?

41:58.249 --> 41:59.409
[Exhales]

42:01.218 --> 42:02.617
Thank you.

42:03.454 --> 42:04.978
No further questions.

42:07.391 --> 42:08.983
It wasrt easy.

42:10.828 --> 42:12.386
I still loved my dad.

42:13.564 --> 42:15.589
(Easton)
Even though he beat you?

42:18.602 --> 42:20.570
I didn't blame him for it.

42:21.672 --> 42:23.139
He had a hard life.

42:23.741 --> 42:25.470
He worked hard for us.

42:26.644 --> 42:28.373
Tell us about that night.

42:29.446 --> 42:31.914
He asked me to help him
fix the boiler...

42:32.783 --> 42:34.648
and I liked doing it.

42:35.185 --> 42:36.550
It made me...

42:37.354 --> 42:39.413
feel useful to him.

42:41.292 --> 42:43.317
And I had this
pair of pliers...

42:44.562 --> 42:45.824
and...

42:48.032 --> 42:50.762
I dropped them
and he lost his temper...

42:51.335 --> 42:53.132
like usual, out of nowhere.

42:55.973 --> 42:57.440
And he swung at me.

42:58.409 --> 43:01.970
He hit me in the arm
and I fell down
and then he hit me again.

43:04.582 --> 43:06.880
I don't know
what happened then. I <i>...</i>

43:08.185 --> 43:10.346
I guess all those times
he beat me.

43:13.657 --> 43:17.991
I think I grabbed the hammer,
and I must have hit him.

43:19.263 --> 43:21.288
[Sean sobs]

43:23.968 --> 43:25.458
I don't remember it.

43:28.606 --> 43:30.767
All I remember is the blood.

43:34.979 --> 43:37.812
Thank you, Sean.
No further questions.

43:42.186 --> 43:43.744
Mr. McKinnon...

43:44.989 --> 43:47.651
how did you feel after
you killed your father?

43:49.560 --> 43:51.187
I don't remember.

43:53.063 --> 43:55.588
How did you feel
when you dragged his body...

43:55.666 --> 43:58.032
36 feet to the service alley?

44:00.337 --> 44:04.569
How did you feel
when you cleaned his blood
off the hall...

44:05.943 --> 44:08.741
and when you broke
the window to make it
look like a burglary?

44:08.812 --> 44:10.040
I don't remember any of it.

44:10.114 --> 44:12.981
Do you remember shoving him up
against a steam pipe?

44:13.050 --> 44:14.108
No!

44:14.184 --> 44:15.981
Do you remember
hitting him with a tire iron?

44:16.053 --> 44:17.042
No!

44:19.556 --> 44:21.615
Would you please
tell the court...

44:21.692 --> 44:23.125
what you wrote...

44:23.260 --> 44:27.128
on your college
financial aid application,
under the heading...

44:27.598 --> 44:29.225
of father's occupation?

44:30.300 --> 44:32.962
Didrt you write
Building Manager?

44:33.871 --> 44:36.305
Why didn't you write
Superintendent?

44:36.940 --> 44:40.137
I wanted to get
the scholarship.
It sounded better than Super.

44:40.210 --> 44:42.678
But you said you were
not ashamed of your father...

44:42.746 --> 44:45.044
and that he was
jealous of you, right?

44:45.449 --> 44:48.816
Yes, it wasrt my fault.
It was something
I had to live with.

44:48.986 --> 44:53.320
Did you have to live
with the fact that he paid
for your prep school tuition?

44:53.390 --> 44:55.688
And that he worked
12 hours a day...

44:55.759 --> 44:57.886
to put expensive clothes
on your back?

44:57.961 --> 45:00.088
Hey, I worked hard, too.
Did you?

45:00.464 --> 45:02.523
I helped with the building.

45:02.900 --> 45:06.597
I helped my sister out.
I got into Princeton...

45:07.538 --> 45:08.869
in spite of <i>...</i>

45:14.044 --> 45:15.375
In spite of what?

45:16.213 --> 45:17.475
Of what he was?

45:17.548 --> 45:19.140
No, I didn't say that.

45:20.084 --> 45:23.451
You claim that
you loved your father.
I did love him.

45:23.921 --> 45:25.616
How do you show your love?

45:25.689 --> 45:28.180
By hiding your father
from your friends?

45:28.258 --> 45:31.022
And by telling him
that he's not won'th anything?

45:33.063 --> 45:34.690
You may call that love.

45:35.399 --> 45:37.196
Most of us call that shame.

45:44.842 --> 45:46.275
No further questions.

45:49.913 --> 45:51.608
(Judge Leon)
Has the jury
reached a verdict?

45:51.682 --> 45:53.115
We have, Your Honor.

45:53.183 --> 45:54.480
On the sole count...

45:54.551 --> 45:58.453
of the indictment,
murder in the second degree,
how does the jury find?

45:59.256 --> 46:01.053
We find the defendant guilty.

46:25.215 --> 46:27.149
Two more months,
he'd have gone to college.

46:27.217 --> 46:28.878
Everything would
have been fine.

46:28.952 --> 46:30.146
It's scary.

46:30.420 --> 46:32.820
No, what's scary is that if
it hadrt been his father...

46:32.890 --> 46:34.881
it would have been
somebody else.

46:34.958 --> 46:38.826
That much anger doesn't
go away with a B. A.
Not even from Princeton.
