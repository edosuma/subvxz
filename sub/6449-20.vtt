JOR-EL:
Your trials are not a riddle, Kai-El.

35:59.323 --> 36:03.111
They are stepping stones on a long path.

36:03.744 --> 36:08.408
Path that I could blindly walk forever,
but I understand now.

36:09.125 --> 36:13.494
This whole time, it's up to me to decide
when to take control of my own destiny.

36:13.671 --> 36:16.879
The trials end
when I'm ready for them to end.

36:17.383 --> 36:20.750
JOR-EL:
Your journey is far from over.

36:23.556 --> 36:25.717
But I can only be what the world needs...

36:25.892 --> 36:30.386
...when I can ﬁnally admit I'm no longer
just the son of Jor-EI or Jonathan Kent.

36:30.563 --> 36:32.269
And you knew the time would come...

36:32.440 --> 36:34.726
...when neither of you
could guide me anymore.

36:34.901 --> 36:36.857
And that time...

36:37.111 --> 36:38.897
...is now.

36:46.913 --> 36:48.778
Goodbye, Jor-El.

37:45.388 --> 37:47.094
You all right?

37:52.687 --> 37:55.554
You know, Clark,
walking a mile in your shoes...

37:55.731 --> 37:58.564
...is so different
than I imagined it would be.

38:00.236 --> 38:02.477
When you're just a reporter with a story...

38:02.655 --> 38:06.273
...the word hits the paper,
the paper hits the stands...

38:06.450 --> 38:08.361
...and it's over.

38:12.873 --> 38:14.864
But for you...

38:15.418 --> 38:18.160
...it's never over, is it?

38:20.256 --> 38:21.336
No.

38:26.929 --> 38:30.467
I guess I tell myself there will always be
a balance of good and evil...

38:30.641 --> 38:33.257
...but it's up to me to tip the scale.

38:35.313 --> 38:37.645
I always knew...

38:38.190 --> 38:39.566
...that you had a big heart.

38:41.986 --> 38:45.149
I just never realized how strong it was.

39:10.973 --> 39:13.009
Good luck, Clark.

39:20.649 --> 39:23.140
LOIS:
I was so weak, Clark.

39:25.946 --> 39:29.359
You know, the very moment
that Toyman threatened you...

39:29.533 --> 39:32.946
...I put on that diode,
and I let him control me...

39:37.666 --> 39:40.624
...because you
are my greatest weakness.

39:40.961 --> 39:43.293
And I'm afraid that I will be yours.

39:43.464 --> 39:45.546
You're not my weakness.

39:45.716 --> 39:47.422
You're my strength.

39:47.593 --> 39:49.174
Okay?

39:49.720 --> 39:53.633
And I'm sorry that Jor-El dragged you
into one of my trials, but it's over.

39:55.810 --> 39:58.893
Jor-El is as much a part of my past
as the farm.

39:59.063 --> 40:00.519
My destiny is marrying you...

40:00.898 --> 40:03.685
...and for us
to create our own future together.

40:08.030 --> 40:10.021
Come on. Everyone's waiting.

40:12.493 --> 40:14.609
Clark, I'm sorry.

40:21.127 --> 40:23.709
After today, I realized that...

40:26.006 --> 40:29.214
...us being together
makes you vulnerable.

40:30.553 --> 40:37.425
And I can't just sit and watch a movie
and eat ice cream...

40:37.601 --> 40:41.810
...when at that very moment
you could be saving ﬁve people.

40:42.523 --> 40:47.233
Clark, every moment of your life
that I take for myself...

40:47.403 --> 40:51.021
...I am stealing
from people who need saving.

I'm sorry, Clark.

No.
