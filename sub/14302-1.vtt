WEBVTT

02:30.416 --> 02:33.085
I can't do it.

02:33.087 --> 02:36.488
Please don't make me do it.

02:44.564 --> 02:46.965
Please, let us live.

02:59.812 --> 03:03.916
No. I'll do it. I'll do it!

04:46.153 --> 04:49.454
Don't worry.
You know how Nancy is.

04:49.456 --> 04:52.424
We're so gonna get hypothermia
this weekend.

04:52.426 --> 04:54.459
Well, most importantly
we forgot the beer.

04:54.461 --> 04:56.161
Oh, I'll get some
before we leave.

04:56.163 --> 04:59.564
Hey, guys, we already
missed our dinner reservations.

04:59.566 --> 05:01.500
I think it's getting too late
to leave today.

05:01.502 --> 05:04.036
Yeah, I know.
I think I'm going to
call the hotel

05:04.038 --> 05:05.904
and let them know
that we'll check in tomorrow.

05:05.906 --> 05:09.374
Okay, but if
the hotel charges us,
I'm going to kick Nancy's ass.

05:09.376 --> 05:11.810
Yeah, I don't even know
why you invited Nancy.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.211
You haven't even spoken to her
in like,

05:13.213 --> 05:14.980
what, six years?

05:14.982 --> 05:17.249
Maybe it's time to accept
things change.

05:17.251 --> 05:18.917
Okay, I don't know
what you guys are talking about.

05:18.919 --> 05:22.521
Nancy is just the same
as she was high school.

05:22.523 --> 05:25.123
We're the ones who have changed.

05:25.125 --> 05:27.025
You certainly have.

05:27.027 --> 05:28.493
Shut up.

05:28.495 --> 05:31.163
Exactly. We have all grown up,
but she's...

05:38.072 --> 05:39.838
Did she bring someone?

05:48.881 --> 05:51.049
Are we all ready?

05:51.051 --> 05:54.019
Jesus, Nancy,
you're four hours late.

05:54.021 --> 05:55.554
Stephanie, chill out.

05:55.556 --> 05:57.622
This is supposed to be
a vacation.

05:57.624 --> 05:58.990
Hello, ladies.

05:58.992 --> 06:00.392
Hi.

06:00.394 --> 06:02.994
This is Annie. We work together.

06:02.996 --> 06:06.131
This is Stephanie,
Daniela and gem.

06:06.133 --> 06:07.566
It's very nice to meet you.

06:07.568 --> 06:09.167
You too.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.670
Here, come with me.

06:11.672 --> 06:13.505
We can put the beer in the
cooler.

06:13.507 --> 06:16.608
Hey, hold up. I have some stuff
in the fridge
that needs to fit in there too.

06:18.845 --> 06:20.312
Who is she?

06:20.314 --> 06:21.713
I told you already.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.682
Who said you could bring
somebody?

06:23.684 --> 06:25.751
What's the big deal?

06:25.753 --> 06:27.886
The big deal is the hotel room
only sleeps four.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.521
So then I'll sleep
on the floor,

06:29.523 --> 06:31.156
or we'll get our own room.

06:31.158 --> 06:33.258
No, the point of this whole
weekend

06:33.260 --> 06:35.761
was for us to get together and
catch up.

06:35.763 --> 06:38.163
We don't even know her.

06:38.165 --> 06:40.732
Look, she and her husband just
separated.

06:40.734 --> 06:44.269
Okay?
She needs this.

06:45.138 --> 06:46.505
Fine.

06:46.507 --> 06:48.473
Whatever.

06:51.644 --> 06:53.178
They didn't all fit,

06:53.180 --> 06:54.713
so I thought I'd bring us one.

06:54.715 --> 06:57.015
I like the way you think.

07:02.188 --> 07:03.622
What?

07:04.490 --> 07:07.025
I'll let one of you drive.
Don't worry.

07:07.027 --> 07:09.494
Just as long as you're sober in
the morning.

07:09.496 --> 07:10.896
Morning?

07:10.898 --> 07:12.297
Yeah, it's too late to leave
now.

07:12.299 --> 07:13.698
We're going to have to go in
the morning.

07:13.700 --> 07:15.066
What do you mean it's too late?

07:15.068 --> 07:17.569
Nancy, you're four hours late.

07:17.571 --> 07:19.638
I had to work last night.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.740
Well, there is this great
invention

07:21.742 --> 07:23.208
called the phone.

07:24.710 --> 07:26.278
Maybe leaving in the morning

07:26.280 --> 07:27.813
isn't such a bad idea.

07:27.815 --> 07:31.516
Come on, Annie. I'll
show you both to your room.

07:31.518 --> 07:33.585
I guess we better go get our
stuff

07:33.587 --> 07:37.088
from the car then.

07:41.728 --> 07:43.528
Yeah, I'm going to start
drinking.

07:43.530 --> 07:45.931
It's going to be a long night.

07:45.933 --> 07:49.434
Yeah, you mean a long weekend.

07:56.609 --> 07:58.643
Thank you.

07:58.645 --> 08:00.712
Okay, so zip lining sounds fun.

08:00.714 --> 08:02.113
What else is there to do?

08:02.115 --> 08:03.348
So, we have kayaking on Sunday.

08:03.350 --> 08:06.151
I already made our
reservations.

08:06.153 --> 08:08.653
Oh, I only made reservations
for four.

08:08.655 --> 08:11.156
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
come.

08:11.158 --> 08:13.191
Of course you should have.

08:13.193 --> 08:15.794
It's a girls' weekend, and
you're a girl.

08:15.796 --> 08:19.030
It's okay, Annie, really.
The more, the merrier.

08:19.032 --> 08:21.066
Mm-hmm.

08:22.802 --> 08:25.237
Hey, not in the house.

08:25.239 --> 08:27.806
Ew, Nance, I can't believe you
haven't quit yet.

08:27.808 --> 08:30.609
Nancy, what a nasty habit.

08:31.611 --> 08:33.010
How long have you been
separated

08:33.013 --> 08:34.446
from your husband?

08:35.214 --> 08:37.048
For like three months now.

08:37.049 --> 08:39.251
And how long were you two
together?

08:39.253 --> 08:41.785
We were actually high school
sweethearts,

08:41.788 --> 08:43.922
so about twelve years.

08:43.924 --> 08:46.958
Wow, I can't even imagine.

08:46.960 --> 08:49.027
Of course you can't imagine.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.196
You've never even had a
boyfriend.

08:51.198 --> 08:53.231
I have too.
I just don't post it

08:53.233 --> 08:54.933
all over the Internet.

08:54.935 --> 08:57.435
Right, it must be like Nancy's
boyfriend

08:57.437 --> 09:00.238
who doesn't even acknowledge
that she exists.

09:02.675 --> 09:04.943
Is she even awake right now?

09:04.945 --> 09:08.780
I'm awake.
I'm just ignoring you.

09:10.616 --> 09:12.083
I'm going to bed.

09:12.085 --> 09:13.618
I didn't get much sleep last
night.

09:13.620 --> 09:16.288
Yeah, that's a shocker.

09:17.790 --> 09:19.224
Good night.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.893
Good night.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.895
You know, it might not seem
like it,

09:23.897 --> 09:26.298
but we used to be best friends.

09:26.300 --> 09:29.267
We even lived in the same block
together.

09:29.269 --> 09:32.571
You ladies remind me of my
sisters and I

09:32.573 --> 09:35.340
when we used to bicker all
the time.

09:35.342 --> 09:39.311
Yeah, that's exactly what we
were like, sisters.

09:39.313 --> 09:40.779
That must be nice.

09:40.781 --> 09:42.547
Sometimes.

09:44.216 --> 09:48.320
I am exhausted so I'm going to
head to bed.

09:48.322 --> 09:52.290
Well, thank you, ladies so much
for having me.
I appreciate it.

09:52.292 --> 09:54.426
- Of course.
- Yeah, of course.

09:55.294 --> 09:56.595
I think I'm going to go to
sleep, too,

09:56.597 --> 09:58.263
because I have a hard time

09:58.265 --> 09:59.698
waking up in the morning.

09:59.700 --> 10:02.033
We know that.

10:04.437 --> 10:07.405
Sorry, you're staying
in the same room as Nancy.

10:07.407 --> 10:10.141
She's asleep though.
She won't bite.

10:10.143 --> 10:12.677
That's what you ladies think.

10:12.679 --> 10:14.779
Good night.

10:50.916 --> 10:52.517
You scared the hell out of me.

10:53.285 --> 10:54.653
Oh, my god.

10:55.287 --> 10:56.721
What are you doing out here?

10:56.723 --> 11:00.859
Sorry, I didn't mean to startle
you.

11:08.567 --> 11:10.635
I'm sorry Daniela is being such
a bitch.

11:10.637 --> 11:12.604
It's okay. It's not like I was

11:12.606 --> 11:15.206
invited exactly, you know.

11:21.047 --> 11:23.748
Well, no one else seemed to
care.

11:23.750 --> 11:26.985
She just always has a huge
stick up her ass.

11:26.987 --> 11:28.520
You know, I noticed that you
two don't

11:28.522 --> 11:30.088
like each other very much.

11:32.124 --> 11:34.826
We just don't have
anything in common anymore.

11:34.828 --> 11:37.796
So then why do this weekend?

11:41.300 --> 11:44.469
She always guilt trips me
about what happened before.

11:46.205 --> 11:50.942
I'm scared to ask.
But what did you do
to that poor girl?

11:52.244 --> 11:56.314
We just teased her
about her weight
when we were in high school.

11:56.316 --> 11:58.416
Who, Daniela?

11:58.418 --> 12:00.418
But she's not fat.

12:00.420 --> 12:03.521
She was back then.
Over 200 pounds.

12:03.523 --> 12:06.891
What? Oh, my gosh.

12:06.893 --> 12:09.561
I wouldn't have imagined
that big.

12:09.563 --> 12:12.097
Maybe a little thicker,
you know.

12:12.099 --> 12:14.632
Psst. What are you doing?

12:14.634 --> 12:16.534
Just having a smoke.

12:16.536 --> 12:18.636
You better go to sleep so we
can get up early.

12:18.638 --> 12:20.071
We will.

12:20.073 --> 12:22.574
You don't want to get in
trouble with mama.

12:22.576 --> 12:24.843
Yeah, right?

12:30.916 --> 12:35.887
Well, I don't want to
get a spanking.

12:35.889 --> 12:38.790
Yeah, sure you don't.

12:44.396 --> 12:48.233
Woohoo!

12:50.136 --> 12:53.371
Wow, I did not expect this
to be this far up.

12:53.373 --> 12:55.106
Piece of cake.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.675
Well, guess what,
i don't like cake.

12:57.677 --> 12:59.177
Nancy, be honest with me,

12:59.179 --> 13:01.246
has anybody ever fallen doing
this before?

13:01.248 --> 13:04.916
No! No, look, it's physically
impossible.

13:04.918 --> 13:07.051
You're securely strapped in.

13:07.053 --> 13:11.156
Don't look down or you're
never gonna do it.

13:11.158 --> 13:15.160
Okay. Lean back, harness.

13:16.829 --> 13:18.396
- You got it.
- Like this, right?

13:18.398 --> 13:19.664
- Yeah.
- Okay.

13:19.666 --> 13:21.566
- You can do it.
- Here I go.

13:24.136 --> 13:25.804
Hold your knees up so you can
go faster!

13:25.806 --> 13:28.606
Why would I want to do that?!

13:29.909 --> 13:31.009
Are you ready?

13:31.011 --> 13:33.211
Yeah.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.149
All right, you're all set.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.051
Woo!

13:41.987 --> 13:45.256
Geronimo!

13:52.298 --> 13:54.399
Â¡Puta!

13:57.536 --> 13:59.170
Okay...

14:09.815 --> 14:11.216
Did he get you this?

14:11.784 --> 14:13.751
You know he did.

14:29.368 --> 14:31.035
Tourist trap.

14:31.037 --> 14:33.137
I'd like to go see it.

14:33.139 --> 14:35.139
All right.

14:35.141 --> 14:38.376
I really love the smell of
nature.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.011
Yeah, I can barely smell it
over all

14:40.013 --> 14:41.613
that perfume you're wearing,
Steph.

14:41.615 --> 14:43.715
Are you guys ready?

14:43.717 --> 14:45.483
We sure are. Where to next?

14:45.485 --> 14:46.951
Well, I'm starving.

14:46.953 --> 14:48.753
Yeah, me too.

14:48.755 --> 14:50.421
Well, we passed that little
town.

14:50.423 --> 14:52.624
Yeah. How 'bout we just start
driving and...

14:52.626 --> 14:55.026
I'm sure we'll find something
eventually, right?

15:36.769 --> 15:38.469
Is there's something wrong with
the car?

15:38.471 --> 15:40.405
No, I just thought maybe we
should go on a hike.

15:40.407 --> 15:41.739
What?

15:41.741 --> 15:44.075
This is the trail you told me
about yesterday, huh?

15:44.077 --> 15:47.111
Yeah, it's just three miles in
a loop.

15:47.113 --> 15:49.080
Daniela, nobody wants to do
this right now.

15:49.082 --> 15:50.682
We can go hiking tomorrow.

15:50.684 --> 15:52.750
No, tomorrow is kayaking,
remember?

15:52.752 --> 15:55.820
You know what, Nancy?
It might be fun.

15:55.822 --> 15:59.657
I guess we are here to do
outdoorsy stuff. Right?

15:59.659 --> 16:02.093
I'm fine with whatever you guys
decide.

16:05.898 --> 16:08.466
Fine. Whatever.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.301
All right. Does everyone have
a water bottle?

16:10.303 --> 16:12.337
Wait, if we are going to go,
i better get

16:12.339 --> 16:14.706
a protein bar,
cause I get hungry.

16:28.954 --> 16:32.056
Sorry. Maybe I shouldn't have
brought you.

16:32.058 --> 16:35.159
It's fine. I actually kind of
like your friends.

16:35.161 --> 16:38.329
I'm glad one of us does.

16:38.331 --> 16:42.266
Okay...I got one for each of us.

16:42.268 --> 16:46.371
All right, it's this way.

16:46.373 --> 16:47.839
Are you sure? This doesn't look

16:47.841 --> 16:49.440
like a trail to me, Dani.

16:49.442 --> 16:51.609
It's a natural trail.

16:52.478 --> 16:55.780
Come on. Follow me.

16:55.782 --> 16:58.850
This is such a bad idea.

17:02.922 --> 17:05.123
Crap.
It's starting to rain.

17:05.958 --> 17:08.026
I don't even have a hood.

17:08.028 --> 17:10.228
How does Daniela get me
into this?

17:10.230 --> 17:12.130
Sorry, gem.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.465
If I'd have known that this trip
was going to be like this...

17:15.468 --> 17:17.502
It's not like you need it
more than me anyways, gem.

17:18.704 --> 17:20.671
This is crazy.

17:20.673 --> 17:22.640
I hate this.

17:22.642 --> 17:25.175
It's getting colder.

17:25.178 --> 17:28.079
I could really use
a venti hot chocolate.

17:28.080 --> 17:29.647
How much longer?

17:29.649 --> 17:31.549
I think we're good.

17:31.551 --> 17:34.285
It's right up here.

17:39.158 --> 17:42.026
Wait. Wait, guys.

17:43.862 --> 17:45.296
This can't be right.

17:45.298 --> 17:46.731
It's been more than three
miles.

17:46.733 --> 17:48.466
I'm tired of walking in the
rain.

17:49.268 --> 17:51.169
You know,
it's not much further.

17:51.171 --> 17:52.637
Just right down there.

17:52.639 --> 17:55.640
No, I need to stop
and drink water.

17:55.642 --> 17:57.608
Yeah.

18:08.554 --> 18:10.555
Are you serious?

18:10.557 --> 18:13.157
No wonder you're so out of
breath, Nancy.

18:13.159 --> 18:17.762
Oh. Here, let me check my
make-up instead.

18:19.265 --> 18:22.166
You could use a touch up.

18:22.168 --> 18:24.936
Hey, it seems like we've been
hiking forever.

18:24.938 --> 18:26.571
Are you sure this is the right
way?

18:26.573 --> 18:29.607
I've done this hike before.
We're really close.

18:29.609 --> 18:32.143
So then you're sure we're going
the right way.

18:32.145 --> 18:35.113
Yes, I'm pretty sure.

18:35.115 --> 18:37.448
Pretty sure?

18:37.450 --> 18:38.850
Listen guys...

18:38.852 --> 18:41.619
There's a spectacular view of
the entire forest

18:41.621 --> 18:43.387
just right up ahead.

18:43.389 --> 18:44.589
What's that smell?

18:44.591 --> 18:45.756
Yeah, I smell it.

18:45.758 --> 18:46.958
Yeah, what is that?

18:49.195 --> 18:50.928
- Ew!
- Smells like something died.

18:51.797 --> 18:54.232
- Oh.
- Gross.

18:54.234 --> 18:56.334
I wonder what happened to it.

18:56.336 --> 18:58.736
Hello! Obviously a bigger
animal killed it.

18:58.738 --> 19:00.271
There are bears in these woods.

19:00.273 --> 19:01.806
There are bears here?

19:01.808 --> 19:04.408
I mean, we are in a forest.

19:04.410 --> 19:07.078
Hello, then, why are we hiking
here?

19:07.080 --> 19:10.348
Because walking in the mall
doesn't count as hiking.

19:10.350 --> 19:11.916
Sorry, Princess.

19:11.918 --> 19:13.851
All right, let's keep going.

19:13.853 --> 19:16.020
You guys are such girls.

19:16.022 --> 19:18.456
It's raining. I'm stuck
out here because of y'all.

19:33.405 --> 19:36.340
See? Told you it was worth it.

19:40.412 --> 19:42.446
Wow!

19:46.218 --> 19:49.954
Look, it's more trees.

19:51.490 --> 19:55.660
It's nice. I just shouldn't
have had so much water.

19:55.662 --> 19:59.597
Hold it or else you're going
out there with the bears.

19:59.599 --> 20:02.667
I think I'm going to have
to take that chance.

20:02.669 --> 20:04.869
Does anybody have toilet paper?

20:04.871 --> 20:06.270
No.

20:06.272 --> 20:08.439
You're going to have to drip
dry.

20:09.608 --> 20:12.977
Hey, you know you don't have
to be that tough, right?

20:12.979 --> 20:15.313
Yeah, right, this is Nancy
we're talking about.

20:15.315 --> 20:15.313
Of course, she does.

20:15.315 --> 20:20.585
She has to put up that huge wall
to protect her heart from
getting hurt.

20:20.587 --> 20:22.620
Annie here is...

20:22.622 --> 20:26.424
Part bartender
and part psychotherapist,
did you know?

20:26.426 --> 20:30.194
Of course, I am.
All of us good bartenders are.

20:30.196 --> 20:32.630
All right, guys, you saw it.
Let's keep going.

20:32.632 --> 20:35.700
Wait, let me
take a picture!

20:35.702 --> 20:37.535
You and your pictures.

20:37.537 --> 20:39.670
I swear this woman
doesn't go to the bathroom

20:39.672 --> 20:42.640
without posting it
on her profile.

20:42.642 --> 20:45.843
At least they're not half
naked pictures of myself.

20:51.583 --> 20:53.084
Seriously?

20:53.086 --> 20:56.320
You guys couldn't wait two
seconds?

21:08.800 --> 21:10.735
Guys.

21:12.504 --> 21:13.671
Guys!

21:13.673 --> 21:15.773
Yes, we've seen it, gem.
It's beautiful.

21:15.775 --> 21:18.409
No, we've been this way before.

21:18.411 --> 21:20.511
It all just begins to look
alike.

21:20.513 --> 21:22.780
Hey, that's what I've been
saying.

21:22.782 --> 21:24.949
No, this looks exactly the same.

21:24.951 --> 21:28.319
Okay, give me your phone.
Let me see
that picture you took.

21:38.597 --> 21:41.165
I think I lost my phone.

21:47.406 --> 21:49.407
Hey, genius,

21:49.409 --> 21:51.442
...is this it?

21:51.444 --> 21:53.711
- Oh, my god.
- You guys, this proves it.

21:53.713 --> 21:55.479
We're in the same spot as
before.

21:55.481 --> 21:57.748
We're walking around in circles?

21:57.750 --> 21:59.317
No, no, no, how could that be?

21:59.319 --> 22:01.218
We've been walking straight
this whole time.

22:01.220 --> 22:02.820
I knew it!

22:02.822 --> 22:06.290
You don't know where you're
going.

22:06.292 --> 22:10.828
So you mean to tell me that
we took a wrong turn somewhere?

22:10.830 --> 22:12.196
It doesn't turn on.

22:12.198 --> 22:14.398
No, I'll check up there,

22:14.400 --> 22:17.001
see if I see anything
familiar, okay?

22:17.869 --> 22:20.304
I'm hungry.

22:21.306 --> 22:24.408
Hey give me mine.

22:24.810 --> 22:26.010
What?

22:26.978 --> 22:29.780
You said that you brought one
for everyone.

22:29.782 --> 22:32.950
That was before we got lost.

22:32.952 --> 22:34.118
Frikkin' gosh.

22:34.120 --> 22:35.619
You know what? That's it.

22:35.621 --> 22:37.188
I am gonna call someone

22:37.190 --> 22:40.358
right now to come get us
out of here.

22:40.360 --> 22:44.962
Oh yeah.
Tell them that they can find us
right next to the tree.

22:44.964 --> 22:47.264
Damn, my phone is dead too.

22:47.266 --> 22:48.833
Aw, shit.

22:48.835 --> 22:50.167
My phone's dead.

22:50.169 --> 22:54.038
It probably lost
battery searching for a signal
or something.

22:54.040 --> 22:55.439
I could have sworn i
charged it

22:55.441 --> 22:57.508
before we left.

22:57.510 --> 22:59.810
You?

23:07.185 --> 23:09.253
Nope.

23:09.255 --> 23:11.422
All right, guys.

23:11.424 --> 23:12.990
It's beginning to clear up.

23:12.992 --> 23:15.025
I think if we just keep going
in that direction,

23:15.027 --> 23:16.427
we'll be fine.

23:16.429 --> 23:18.496
Right. Is your phone working?

23:18.498 --> 23:20.798
I left it charging in the car.

23:20.800 --> 23:23.100
Why would you leave it
in the car?

23:23.102 --> 23:26.404
It's not like there's any
reception out here anyways.

23:26.406 --> 23:28.873
Come on, let's keep going.

23:34.679 --> 23:37.281
These are your damn friends.

23:37.283 --> 23:40.050
Don't remind me.

24:21.193 --> 24:23.060
- Wait!
- What's wrong?

24:23.062 --> 24:24.462
You can't feel that?

24:24.464 --> 24:26.397
- What are you talking about?
What is it?
- Don't move!

24:26.399 --> 24:30.935
My leg! Oh, my gosh!
Nancy, my leg!

24:30.937 --> 24:33.304
- What are we gonna do?
- We're gonna have to
break the stick.

24:33.306 --> 24:34.705
How?

24:34.707 --> 24:36.240
Don't touch, don't
touch me.

24:36.242 --> 24:37.608
Okay.

24:37.610 --> 24:39.677
We're going to have to
lift her up

24:39.679 --> 24:41.679
so that she slides
off the stick.

24:41.681 --> 24:44.014
Guys, she's bleeding a lot
though.

24:44.016 --> 24:45.483
We're going to have to put a
tourniquet

24:45.485 --> 24:46.951
around her thigh above the
wound.

24:46.953 --> 24:49.487
What can we use as a tourniquet?

24:49.489 --> 24:50.821
Oh.

24:50.823 --> 24:53.023
Here, use this.

24:53.558 --> 24:56.560
It hurts so bad.

24:58.997 --> 25:01.298
Be still, all right?

25:07.973 --> 25:10.708
Come on. I need your guys' help.

25:13.845 --> 25:17.948
All right, on three.
Okay?

25:18.650 --> 25:21.652
One, two, three.

25:31.898 --> 25:34.465
Careful. Careful.

25:38.537 --> 25:40.604
You guys, I hate to say it, but

25:40.606 --> 25:43.240
it's getting dark, we got to
keep moving.

25:43.242 --> 25:46.143
How are we supposed
to continue now, Daniela?

25:46.145 --> 25:48.746
Now more than ever.
We gotta get out of here.

25:48.748 --> 25:51.482
We weren't supposed to be
on this stupid hike
in the first place.

25:51.484 --> 25:52.850
Okay, stop it, you two.

25:52.852 --> 25:54.818
Fighting is not going
to help anything right now.

25:54.820 --> 25:57.288
We just need to get Annie
out of here.

25:57.290 --> 25:59.256
Maybe we can carry her down.

25:59.258 --> 26:00.991
And how are we supposed to do
that?

26:00.993 --> 26:04.361
We've been saying
we're almost there
for more than four hours now.

26:04.363 --> 26:06.330
Yeah, guys, we're totally lost.

26:06.332 --> 26:08.065
We're not lost.

26:08.067 --> 26:10.234
Stop saying that!

26:10.236 --> 26:14.004
Okay, what if a couple of us go
and try to find help.

26:14.006 --> 26:16.140
Okay, you guys go,

26:16.142 --> 26:17.474
and I'll stay here with Annie.

26:17.476 --> 26:19.076
Yeah, I'll stay here too.

26:19.078 --> 26:21.045
No, you go with them.

26:21.047 --> 26:22.713
I don't want to see your face
right now.

26:24.082 --> 26:26.050
Okay.

26:26.052 --> 26:28.185
Annie, I'm so sorry.

26:28.187 --> 26:30.087
It's okay.

26:30.555 --> 26:32.423
Come on, Dani.

26:32.425 --> 26:35.826
We'll be back as soon as we can.

26:35.828 --> 26:37.928
Hurry.

26:43.969 --> 26:45.603
Don't beat yourself up, Dani.

26:45.605 --> 26:47.504
It's not your fault.

26:47.506 --> 26:49.340
Well, she did get us lost.

26:49.342 --> 26:52.042
It's not her fault that Annie
fell.

27:02.587 --> 27:05.489
Hey, guys, look!

27:05.491 --> 27:07.524
Come on!

27:12.631 --> 27:14.765
Hello?

27:16.334 --> 27:18.469
Hello?

27:18.471 --> 27:20.204
It's open. Should I go in?

27:20.206 --> 27:22.473
No, what if someone lives there?

27:28.647 --> 27:30.714
No, I don't think there's
anybody in there.

27:30.716 --> 27:32.983
Yeah, but maybe there'll be
a phone inside.

27:32.985 --> 27:37.688
Guys, who are we kidding?
This place has been
abandoned for years.

27:37.690 --> 27:40.324
Hello? Is there anyone here?

27:41.459 --> 27:43.827
Come on, we're wasting daylight.
We need to keep moving.

27:43.829 --> 27:45.796
Yeah, Dani's right. Let's go.

27:45.798 --> 27:47.865
No, no, hold on just one second.

27:48.667 --> 27:50.701
Stephanie, come on.

27:52.737 --> 27:54.505
Hello?

27:55.373 --> 27:57.007
Shit.

28:04.549 --> 28:05.849
No phone.

28:05.851 --> 28:07.584
Told you.

28:07.586 --> 28:08.852
Okay.

28:20.932 --> 28:23.067
Which way?

28:24.869 --> 28:27.004
I don't know.

28:27.006 --> 28:28.605
I thought you'd done this trail
before.

28:28.607 --> 28:31.842
Yeah, but it was months ago.
I don't remember exactly.

28:31.844 --> 28:35.345
Okay, so what if we just
go one way
and if that doesn't work out

28:35.347 --> 28:37.414
we'll double back
and go the other.

28:37.416 --> 28:39.450
Fine.

28:40.485 --> 28:42.219
Let's go right first.

29:02.574 --> 29:05.109
I'm getting really cold.

29:06.010 --> 29:07.978
Yeah, it's getting colder

29:07.980 --> 29:10.147
now that the sun went down.

29:13.284 --> 29:17.888
You think the girls will be
back soon?

29:17.890 --> 29:20.023
I don't know.

29:21.726 --> 29:24.361
It's so dark out.

29:24.829 --> 29:26.897
Don't worry.

29:29.400 --> 29:31.935
I brought a flashlight.

29:34.105 --> 29:38.242
Wow, you actually came prepared?

29:39.444 --> 29:43.680
No. I just took it
from Daniela's house
to fuck with her.

29:43.682 --> 29:45.849
Oh, no.

29:45.851 --> 29:48.118
Please, no.

29:50.188 --> 29:52.089
How is this even possible?

29:52.091 --> 29:55.626
Wait, why did you guys
come from that direction?

29:55.628 --> 30:00.564
So you guys haven't
even found a way out yet?

30:00.566 --> 30:04.434
No, Annie, we somehow
circled around again!

30:04.436 --> 30:08.372
It must be that we should have
gone left at the fork.

30:08.374 --> 30:10.574
So you guys didn't find help?

30:10.576 --> 30:14.444
No, obviously not, we just went
in a huge freaking circle.

30:14.446 --> 30:19.383
Nancy, I'm too cold.
It's too cold.

30:19.385 --> 30:22.252
Guys, we need to find
something to cover Annie with.

30:22.254 --> 30:24.521
It's going to be below freezing
here tonight.

30:24.523 --> 30:26.824
There is a cabin up ahead.

30:26.826 --> 30:29.593
I mean, it's at least
some sort of shelter for the
night, right?

30:29.595 --> 30:31.562
How far is it?

30:31.564 --> 30:33.730
I don't know. Maybe like half a
mile.

30:33.732 --> 30:35.766
Yeah.

30:36.668 --> 30:38.769
Okay, someone help me carry
Annie.

30:38.771 --> 30:40.103
I'll do it.

30:41.005 --> 30:43.941
Steph, get my backpack.

30:46.277 --> 30:50.414
All right. Come on.
You can do it. Come on.

30:52.384 --> 30:55.519
Wait, wait, wait, okay.

31:17.575 --> 31:19.810
Watch your step.

31:22.680 --> 31:25.716
Be careful.

31:25.718 --> 31:28.118
Wait, wait, wait.

31:28.120 --> 31:30.153
We're almost there.

31:30.155 --> 31:32.155
You can do it.

31:37.897 --> 31:41.131
Go ahead.

31:41.966 --> 31:44.167
Be careful.

31:46.604 --> 31:48.005
Hey,

31:48.007 --> 31:49.673
I think I'm going to keep going.

31:49.675 --> 31:51.708
What?
And hike through the night?

31:51.710 --> 31:53.410
It's freezing outside, Steph.

31:53.412 --> 31:57.414
Yeah, but Annie is feeling weak
and cold.

31:57.416 --> 32:01.685
It's cold out, but she'll be
warmer inside.

32:01.687 --> 32:04.187
Or she's cold because she's
lost so much blood

32:04.189 --> 32:06.423
that now she's losing body
temperature.

32:06.425 --> 32:09.226
Steph, if we hike through the
night,

32:09.228 --> 32:11.194
then none of us are going make
it.

32:12.764 --> 32:15.332
Where's my backpack? I need a
cigarette.

32:15.334 --> 32:16.233
Here.

32:17.335 --> 32:21.204
Are you seriously going to
smoke at a time like this?

32:23.808 --> 32:25.342
Excuse me.

32:25.944 --> 32:27.711
You guys.

32:33.785 --> 32:35.652
How is she?

32:35.654 --> 32:38.956
She's really weak.

32:43.262 --> 32:45.796
God, how long has this place
been empty?

32:45.798 --> 32:47.564
Who knows?

32:47.566 --> 32:50.000
Do you know if there's any food?

32:50.002 --> 32:52.803
I don't know but there's no
water or power.

32:52.805 --> 32:56.873
I found some candles though.

32:56.875 --> 32:58.709
There's dirty dishes in the
sink.

32:58.711 --> 33:00.610
Stuff everywhere.

33:00.612 --> 33:02.346
It's like they just left
everything behind one day.

33:02.348 --> 33:04.915
Oh, god.

33:13.124 --> 33:15.158
How tacky.

33:17.362 --> 33:21.031
Everything's expired.

33:22.935 --> 33:26.903
I'm so hungry that I think
I'll take that chance.

33:26.905 --> 33:28.739
You don't want to do that.
You're just going to get sicker.

33:28.741 --> 33:31.341
It's just going to make things
worse.

33:37.815 --> 33:41.385
Hey, this expired only a year
ago.

33:41.387 --> 33:45.555
I'll eat it. I've eaten stuff
that's way more expired
than that.

33:45.557 --> 33:47.491
There's also the protein bars.

33:48.259 --> 33:51.395
Oh, I don't have any left.

33:52.864 --> 33:54.431
What?

33:54.433 --> 33:56.333
You selfish, bitch.

33:56.335 --> 33:58.201
I didn't know this was going to
happen.

33:58.203 --> 34:03.974
Relax! When we go outside,
we'll find some fruits or
something.

34:03.976 --> 34:06.209
I hate to bust your bubble,
Einstein,

34:06.211 --> 34:07.544
but it's winter.

34:07.546 --> 34:09.679
There aren't any leaves on
those trees,

34:09.681 --> 34:10.480
much less fruit.

34:11.315 --> 34:15.452
There's got to be something we
can eat.

34:15.454 --> 34:19.755
Yep, there must be something
we can eat.

34:19.757 --> 34:22.893
Okay, so I was wrong.

34:22.895 --> 34:26.096
There's been a lot of that
today.

34:26.098 --> 34:28.098
As soon as it's morning, I'll
set out.

34:28.100 --> 34:30.367
We'll go left this time

34:30.369 --> 34:32.702
and we'll find the way out.

34:32.704 --> 34:36.406
I'm so tired of hearing you say
that.

34:38.109 --> 34:41.911
Yeah, that is getting kind of
old.

34:44.215 --> 34:46.248
I'm kind of tired.

34:46.251 --> 34:48.284
I think I'm going to go
and just take a nap.

34:48.286 --> 34:51.420
Yeah, you rest, Annie.

35:08.439 --> 35:10.507
Oh, my god,

35:10.509 --> 35:12.509
she's still bleeding.

35:12.511 --> 35:15.912
What? Maybe the tourniquet
is not tight enough.

35:25.623 --> 35:28.959
I wonder what happened
to the family who lived here.

35:28.961 --> 35:31.995
They left everything behind.

35:31.997 --> 35:34.064
Maybe it's that curse.

35:34.066 --> 35:36.066
What curse?

35:36.068 --> 35:39.202
There was this pamphlet
at the zip lining place.

35:39.204 --> 35:41.171
Okay, and what did it say?

35:41.173 --> 35:42.739
There was an old mill here

35:42.741 --> 35:44.207
and a lot of bad things
happened there.

35:44.209 --> 35:45.675
Like what?

35:45.677 --> 35:47.344
They polluted the water so badly

35:47.346 --> 35:49.346
that all the vegetation died,

35:49.348 --> 35:51.047
all the wildlife died.

35:51.916 --> 35:54.484
So they say that the place is
cursed.

35:54.486 --> 35:57.420
Looks like there's
plenty of vegetation to me.

35:57.422 --> 36:01.358
They do say that the area has
made a miraculous turn around.

36:01.360 --> 36:02.826
You read the same pamphlet?

36:02.828 --> 36:05.028
Last time I was up here, i
heard about it.

36:05.030 --> 36:06.796
So what's this curse?

36:06.798 --> 36:13.370
They say that no one can be here
until the earth is replenished.

36:13.372 --> 36:14.971
Shortly after, the mill caught
fire

36:14.973 --> 36:16.940
and everyone inside died,

36:16.942 --> 36:18.775
including the owner.

36:18.777 --> 36:21.278
Yeah, a lot of freak accidents
have happened in the forest.

36:21.280 --> 36:23.780
The pamphlet had a bunch of
precautions and

36:23.782 --> 36:26.316
stuff that you should bring
before you go on a hike.

36:26.318 --> 36:28.185
Yeah, like bringing extra food?

36:28.187 --> 36:30.420
What, I forgot.

36:30.422 --> 36:32.989
So, who did you come here
with before, Daniela?

36:32.991 --> 36:35.492
Gem, what is wrong with you?

36:35.494 --> 36:38.828
I'm itching like crazy.

36:41.799 --> 36:44.501
Oh, my god, ew, what is that?

36:44.503 --> 36:46.870
It looks like you touched
poison Ivy.

36:46.872 --> 36:50.941
No, it can't be. She had gloves
on.

36:50.943 --> 36:54.177
What's wrong? What's wrong?

36:54.179 --> 36:58.915
I wiped myself with a leaf
when I peed in the forest.

37:04.355 --> 37:08.458
Oh!

37:08.460 --> 37:09.893
Oh, gem, stop
scratching,

37:09.895 --> 37:11.361
you're only making it worse.

37:11.363 --> 37:15.332
I'll go see if there's anything
in the medicine cabinet.

37:19.370 --> 37:20.837
No, no, no. Stop!

37:20.839 --> 37:22.806
We need the water.

37:22.808 --> 37:25.709
Here! It's expired,
but maybe it will work.

37:28.679 --> 37:30.814
So, is it working?

37:30.816 --> 37:32.282
Oh, yeah. I don't know.

37:32.284 --> 37:33.817
It's something cold.

37:33.819 --> 37:36.219
Hey, how expired is it?

37:36.221 --> 37:38.388
Very.

37:42.593 --> 37:44.461
I'm beginning to feel better.

37:46.031 --> 37:49.399
Oh, my...

37:49.967 --> 37:51.635
It's not funny, you guys.

37:51.637 --> 37:54.337
Yeah, except that would
only happen to you, gem.

37:54.339 --> 37:57.207
Yeah, like that time in
summer camp when you jumped

37:57.209 --> 37:59.276
in the lake and your top
magically came off.

37:59.278 --> 38:02.912
Or that time in p.E.
When your shorts just split.

38:02.914 --> 38:06.383
You have had a lot of
wardrobe malfunctions.

38:06.385 --> 38:08.018
Well, at least mine were
accidents.

38:08.020 --> 38:10.787
You were taking your off clothes
on purpose all the time.

38:10.789 --> 38:13.056
Were? Have you not seen her
profile lately?

38:13.058 --> 38:15.492
She's half naked in every
picture.

38:15.494 --> 38:19.095
You're just jealous cause no one
wants to see you naked, Daniela.

38:19.097 --> 38:21.064
And who wants to see you naked?

38:21.066 --> 38:22.599
Definitely not your boyfriend.

38:22.601 --> 38:24.167
I mean he doesn't even act like
you exist.

38:24.169 --> 38:26.870
Daniela, you may have lost all
that weight,

38:26.872 --> 38:29.205
but I don't see you with
anybody ever.

38:29.207 --> 38:31.141
Just because I'm not declaring
my love

38:31.143 --> 38:32.609
for a new guy every week,

38:32.611 --> 38:34.110
doesn't mean and anything.

38:34.112 --> 38:37.147
At least, I'm not posting gushy
messages

38:37.149 --> 38:38.581
for the world to see.

38:38.583 --> 38:39.816
Who are you trying to convince
about

38:39.818 --> 38:41.251
your perfect relationship?

38:41.253 --> 38:42.886
Us or yourself?

38:42.888 --> 38:47.924
Guys! I don't feel a pulse.

39:07.778 --> 39:10.914
Guys, what are we going to do
with Annie?

39:10.916 --> 39:12.415
Well, we can't carry her.

39:12.417 --> 39:14.417
We'll have to have someone come
back for her.

39:14.419 --> 39:16.386
Yeah, as soon as we find help.

39:16.388 --> 39:18.488
No, some animal could find her.

39:18.490 --> 39:20.657
We can just lock the door

39:20.659 --> 39:22.759
so that they don't come in.

39:22.761 --> 39:26.663
No, a bear could smell her
and...

39:26.665 --> 39:28.665
Guys, we're going to be out of
here

39:28.667 --> 39:30.867
in a couple of hours, tops.

39:30.869 --> 39:33.336
Who the fuck are you kidding?

39:38.542 --> 39:40.744
Come on.

39:55.359 --> 39:58.161
Go to the left, Nancy.

40:03.634 --> 40:06.269
Wow, she's really
upset.

40:06.271 --> 40:08.371
It's her friend.

40:08.373 --> 40:09.739
Aren't we all upset?

40:09.741 --> 40:11.241
Of course.

40:11.243 --> 40:12.742
God, I'm thirsty.

40:12.744 --> 40:14.411
You guys have water?

40:14.413 --> 40:17.947
You shouldn't have
poured it all
down your frikkin' crotch, gem.

40:38.469 --> 40:41.137
What the hell?

40:41.139 --> 40:43.039
This is where this ends?

40:43.041 --> 40:45.074
We went right last time, right?

40:45.076 --> 40:47.076
Yes, I'm sure we went right
last time.

40:47.078 --> 40:50.246
Okay, so, if it's not right and
it's not left, which way is it?

40:50.248 --> 40:53.917
We just need to double back,
and we'll find another turn.

40:53.919 --> 40:56.453
There is no other turn.

40:56.455 --> 40:58.421
We aren't making it off this
mountain.

40:58.423 --> 41:01.558
I don't know about you, but i
am.

41:01.560 --> 41:03.660
Wait! You guys hear that?

41:03.662 --> 41:05.495
Hear what?

41:05.497 --> 41:08.298
It's water.

41:33.224 --> 41:35.225
- Wait.
- What?

41:35.227 --> 41:37.360
How do you know if it's safe
to drink this water?

41:37.362 --> 41:40.797
Gem, I don't think we have the
luxury to get picky
at this point.

41:40.799 --> 41:44.934
No, I saw on TV that you're
supposed to treat spring water

41:44.936 --> 41:48.071
before you drink it because
of bacteria or something.

41:48.073 --> 41:52.041
Yeah, if you get the runs,
you'll get really dehydrated.

41:52.043 --> 41:54.944
You know what else
makes you dehydrated?

41:54.946 --> 41:56.846
Not drinking water.

42:16.400 --> 42:20.303
Oh, yeah, better than anything
in the supermarket.

42:24.542 --> 42:27.544
Look, gem, now you have enough
water

42:27.546 --> 42:30.313
to cool down your crotch for
hours.

42:36.787 --> 42:39.656
So what do we do now?

42:39.658 --> 42:41.257
We can follow the stream down.

42:41.259 --> 42:43.993
It'll empty out into a river
or something like that.

42:43.995 --> 42:47.397
And we can follow the river to
civilization.

42:52.903 --> 42:54.437
This water is so cold that

42:54.439 --> 42:56.472
I don't feel my hand.

42:57.608 --> 43:00.643
Hey, don't leave them in there
too long.

43:00.645 --> 43:03.513
You can get frostbite.

43:10.921 --> 43:12.922
Wait!

43:23.667 --> 43:25.735
Wait!

44:10.514 --> 44:14.884
Look, it's a building!

44:15.753 --> 44:18.755
Wait for me.

44:18.757 --> 44:21.424
We're saved.

44:34.772 --> 44:37.507
Hey!

44:44.415 --> 44:47.283
It's that mill from the
pamphlet.

45:23.787 --> 45:26.723
There's not much left after the
fire.

45:34.364 --> 45:37.166
So this is where it all started.

45:37.168 --> 45:41.504
Maybe it wasn't such a good idea
to drink that water.

45:41.506 --> 45:45.441
So you believe in the curse too
now, huh?

45:45.443 --> 45:47.844
What's wrong?

45:47.846 --> 45:49.912
My hand.

45:51.949 --> 45:54.150
Here, let me see it.

45:56.186 --> 45:57.553
What happened to you?

45:57.555 --> 45:59.455
I lost my glove.

46:03.861 --> 46:05.294
Oh, god.

46:05.296 --> 46:07.630
I'm going to lose my fingers,
aren't I?

46:07.632 --> 46:09.532
You better wrap that thing
before it gets worse.

46:09.534 --> 46:11.334
Right now, it's just your
fingertips.

46:11.336 --> 46:13.469
Wrap it up with what?

46:13.471 --> 46:15.671
Anyone have an extra set of
gloves?

46:17.775 --> 46:19.876
Here.

46:19.878 --> 46:21.444
What about you?

46:21.446 --> 46:23.613
You need them more than I do.

46:25.816 --> 46:30.253
I have a left one, so I'm not
too worried about matching.

46:32.489 --> 46:34.557
I'm so hungry.

46:34.559 --> 46:36.559
We can't stay here. We have to
keep going.

46:36.561 --> 46:38.494
There's nothing here.

46:38.496 --> 46:40.463
Well, it's going to get dark
soon.

46:40.465 --> 46:41.998
We can't stay here.

46:42.000 --> 46:43.499
These walls won't be much
shelter from the cold.

46:43.501 --> 46:45.635
At least, they'll shelter us
from the wind.

46:45.637 --> 46:48.671
I'm tired. I need to rest.

46:48.673 --> 46:50.239
Fine, stay,

46:50.241 --> 46:52.341
but I'm hiking up to higher
ground

46:52.343 --> 46:54.510
and see if I see anything in
the distance.

46:54.512 --> 46:56.445
You really want to expend your
energy doing that?

46:56.447 --> 46:59.782
Yeah, I do, because we need to
figure out

46:59.784 --> 47:02.385
how much farther we need to go.

47:09.092 --> 47:11.194
You guys, we got to find some
food or something.

47:11.196 --> 47:13.563
I mean, we're running on fumes.

47:14.531 --> 47:17.266
A person can live several days
without food

47:17.268 --> 47:19.869
as long as they have water.

47:19.871 --> 47:23.673
What if we go fishing or
something?

47:23.675 --> 47:27.743
Using what exactly?

47:28.779 --> 47:32.882
I don't know.

47:32.884 --> 47:38.588
Who's going to want to date me
now that I don't have fingers?

47:38.590 --> 47:43.292
You don't know for a fact
that you're going to lose them.

48:01.111 --> 48:02.979
Crap!

48:38.248 --> 48:42.351
We're so screwed. Oh, my
freaking god.

49:47.217 --> 49:49.452
What the hell?

49:50.654 --> 49:53.656
God, I hope it doesn't rain
on top of everything else.

49:53.658 --> 49:55.858
We got to keep moving soon
or we are not going to

49:55.860 --> 49:59.962
find an actual roof before
sundown.

50:01.331 --> 50:03.866
I'm going to find Stephanie.

50:26.823 --> 50:30.259
Now, it's getting really cold.

50:30.261 --> 50:35.231
Sun's going down. It'll be dark
soon.

50:38.835 --> 50:43.906
You know you think about
how you're going to die.

50:43.908 --> 50:47.176
I never thought I'd end like
this.

50:47.178 --> 50:50.346
Hey, don't talk like that.

50:55.685 --> 50:57.987
Stephanie! Stephanie!

51:19.743 --> 51:22.678
Stephanie!

51:44.534 --> 51:48.737
Stephanie? Stephanie!

53:58.935 --> 54:01.003
Oh, god!

54:49.352 --> 54:54.089
Dani, I'm sorry if I wasn't
nice to you in high school.

54:54.091 --> 54:56.825
That was a long time ago.

54:56.827 --> 55:00.095
It was mostly Nancy anyway.

55:01.164 --> 55:03.732
I should've been a better
friend.

55:07.304 --> 55:10.172
I don't really want to talk
about high school right now.

55:10.174 --> 55:11.540
Okay.

55:11.542 --> 55:13.075
We have to go.

55:13.077 --> 55:15.611
You found somewhere close by?

55:15.613 --> 55:17.880
Yeah, just a few miles from
here.

55:17.882 --> 55:20.382
What happened to your hand?

55:20.384 --> 55:22.117
There was glass.

55:22.119 --> 55:24.920
Do you guys have something
i can wrap it with?

55:28.992 --> 55:31.060
Here, eat.

55:33.096 --> 55:35.397
Where did you get these?

55:35.399 --> 55:37.466
Don't ask.

55:37.468 --> 55:39.368
Where is Stephanie?

55:39.370 --> 55:41.570
Stephanie is dead.

55:41.572 --> 55:43.739
What?

55:43.741 --> 55:47.242
I think we'll be safer the
farther we get from these ruins.

55:47.244 --> 55:48.877
Here.

55:48.879 --> 55:51.480
So you think the curse is real
now?

55:51.482 --> 55:54.249
It's better to be safe than
sorry.

55:55.618 --> 55:58.120
Come on. Get your
stuff.

55:58.122 --> 56:01.256
Hurry up.

56:02.292 --> 56:04.326
What happened to
Stephanie?

56:04.328 --> 56:07.930
I'll tell you when
we're away from here.

56:27.817 --> 56:31.587
Wait. How much longer, do you
think?

56:31.589 --> 56:33.155
We can stop here for the night,

56:33.157 --> 56:35.157
if you can't keep going.

56:35.159 --> 56:39.495
No. I'd rather keep going.

56:39.497 --> 56:41.764
Yeah, me too. I mean, we don't
have any shelter.

56:41.766 --> 56:44.400
It's just going to get colder
and colder

56:45.802 --> 56:48.370
there's only one problem.

56:48.372 --> 56:51.340
You don't know where it is in
the dark?

56:51.342 --> 56:54.410
I didn't really see a place we
could hike to.

56:54.412 --> 56:56.412
What?

56:56.414 --> 56:59.581
I just told you guys that so
you would leave that place.

56:59.583 --> 57:02.684
What is wrong with you?

57:02.686 --> 57:05.788
There is something really
wrong with that place.

57:05.790 --> 57:08.157
Why? Because Stephanie
had her accident there?

57:08.159 --> 57:10.826
Yeah, because of that and
i also found a severed hand

57:10.828 --> 57:13.595
just a few feet away from where
she was. Okay?

57:13.597 --> 57:15.197
A severed hand?

57:15.199 --> 57:18.367
What happened to the rest of
the body?

57:19.736 --> 57:23.605
I don't know. Maybe a bear ate
it or something.

57:27.076 --> 57:28.710
So the curse is true.

57:28.712 --> 57:32.281
No, it's just all a coincidence.

57:32.283 --> 57:34.082
Right?

57:37.120 --> 57:39.822
I'm going to gather some
branches,

57:39.824 --> 57:42.591
so we can build a fire to warm
us up.

57:42.593 --> 57:44.693
I'll help you.

57:46.429 --> 57:49.565
Okay. Let's go.

58:08.384 --> 58:11.553
How's your hand?

58:11.555 --> 58:14.656
Well...

58:15.091 --> 58:17.993
Bleeding stopped.

58:17.995 --> 58:20.729
I don't suppose you want this
back.

58:20.731 --> 58:22.397
No, it's all yours.

58:22.399 --> 58:24.233
How's your hand?

58:24.235 --> 58:27.402
I don't feel my hand. Or my...

58:29.672 --> 58:31.473
Here, let me see it.

58:49.626 --> 58:53.161
- Can you feel this?
- No.

58:53.163 --> 58:55.564
What about this?

58:56.232 --> 58:58.634
You feel that?

59:00.470 --> 59:02.804
How about this one?

59:03.840 --> 59:07.042
Yeah, I feel that one.

59:09.646 --> 59:12.214
We're gonna have to amputate
the fingers.

59:12.216 --> 59:15.384
Otherwise, your whole hand
is going to get gangrene.

59:17.287 --> 59:18.687
No!

59:18.689 --> 59:20.155
No way, Nance!

59:20.157 --> 59:23.926
We'll get her to a doctor,
and they'll take care of it.

59:23.928 --> 59:26.862
Look, guys, we have to be
realistic

59:26.864 --> 59:29.932
that we might be out here
for a long time.

59:29.934 --> 59:31.934
If we don't take off her
fingers,

59:31.936 --> 59:33.402
by the time we find help,

59:33.404 --> 59:35.537
she could lose her entire hand.

59:35.539 --> 59:39.474
I mean, better four fingers
than a whole hand.

59:39.476 --> 59:45.981
No, I don't want to lose my
fingers.

59:45.983 --> 59:49.451
They're already lost. This is
dead tissue.

59:49.453 --> 59:52.821
That's why you can't feel
anything.

59:52.823 --> 59:55.757
We don't have
anything to cut with, so...

01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:02.397
That?

01:00:02.399 --> 01:00:04.499
They're already dead.

01:00:04.501 --> 01:00:06.468
You won't feel a thing.

01:00:07.170 --> 01:00:09.638
Actually, um...

01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:12.608
...we have to cut just past

01:00:12.610 --> 01:00:15.611
where the dead tissue ends.

01:00:17.013 --> 01:00:19.514
Without anesthesia? No.

01:00:19.516 --> 01:00:24.519
Gem, if we don't do it, you
could die.

01:00:26.055 --> 01:00:28.624
Yeah, I'd prefer that.

01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:52.447
Stop struggling, please.

01:00:52.449 --> 01:00:54.750
You're making it harder.

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:12.034
She fainted.

01:01:15.738 --> 01:01:17.773
It's better that way.

01:01:39.228 --> 01:01:42.397
I'm going to go behind a tree.

01:01:42.399 --> 01:01:44.466
Stay close.

01:02:15.865 --> 01:02:17.399
That was quick.

01:02:17.401 --> 01:02:19.334
False alarm.

01:02:25.676 --> 01:02:27.809
Oh, my god.

01:02:28.277 --> 01:02:30.011
Don't worry.

01:02:30.013 --> 01:02:32.280
They're more afraid of us,
than we are of them.

01:02:36.552 --> 01:02:40.288
I'm really glad gem
is asleep right now.

01:02:41.924 --> 01:02:43.458
Yeah.

01:02:55.271 --> 01:02:57.339
Come on.

01:02:57.341 --> 01:02:59.808
- Let's go.
- Come on.

01:02:59.810 --> 01:03:02.277
Come on.

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:06.381
We got you. Come on.

01:03:06.383 --> 01:03:08.350
Ready?

01:03:41.885 --> 01:03:44.186
Where is it?

01:03:53.663 --> 01:03:56.064
I don't think he saw us.

01:04:01.304 --> 01:04:04.940
You know, it probably can't
cross the river anyway.

01:04:04.942 --> 01:04:09.511
No, I think it's pretty shallow
there.

01:04:09.513 --> 01:04:11.379
Then, what do we do?

01:04:11.381 --> 01:04:13.281
Let's walk back into the forest.

01:04:13.283 --> 01:04:16.017
No way, gem. You're too weak
for that.

01:04:16.019 --> 01:04:18.486
Our only hope is to keep going
down the river.

01:04:18.488 --> 01:04:23.458
Look, he's probably more scared
of us than we are of him.

01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:26.094
I'll go first by myself. And
you'll see

01:04:26.096 --> 01:04:30.198
that he just goes back into the
woods and leaves us alone.

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:33.168
What if you're wrong, Nancy?

01:04:33.170 --> 01:04:36.304
I'm not. You'll see.

01:04:40.476 --> 01:04:44.246
As soon as he's spooked away,
you guys can follow me. Okay?

01:05:22.551 --> 01:05:24.419
Okay. Come on, come on.

01:05:24.421 --> 01:05:26.021
We have to make a run for it.

01:05:26.023 --> 01:05:28.290
- What about Nancy?
- It's too late for her now.

01:05:28.292 --> 01:05:30.325
Come on, let's go.

01:05:58.888 --> 01:06:02.691
Come on. At this rate, we'll
never make it.

01:06:02.693 --> 01:06:06.261
I can't keep going anymore. I
need food.

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:33.355
Another one.

01:06:35.792 --> 01:06:38.927
You don't have anything
in your stomach to throw up.

01:06:38.929 --> 01:06:41.596
How can you even look at that?

01:06:41.598 --> 01:06:46.034
I don't know. It's like I've
become... numb.

01:06:49.472 --> 01:06:51.773
Dani, she looks familiar.

01:06:51.775 --> 01:06:53.675
How?

01:06:54.977 --> 01:06:57.912
She looks like a woman in the
picture.

01:06:57.914 --> 01:06:59.881
What picture?

01:06:59.883 --> 01:07:01.883
There was a picture in the
cabin,

01:07:01.885 --> 01:07:03.918
and she's wearing the same
funky hat.

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:05.286
That cabin was abandoned years
ago.

01:07:05.288 --> 01:07:08.623
There's no way.
This body is barely decomposed.

01:07:08.625 --> 01:07:12.894
I'm telling you, Dani, it's the
same funky hat.

01:07:12.896 --> 01:07:17.232
It's just a coincidence. Let's
keep going.

01:07:34.717 --> 01:07:37.018
Hurry up.

01:07:42.291 --> 01:07:44.993
Wait. Wait please.

01:07:46.529 --> 01:07:50.732
I need five minutes. I need...

01:07:53.335 --> 01:07:54.369
I need a minute.

01:07:55.204 --> 01:07:58.673
I just need a... I need a quick
nap.

01:07:58.675 --> 01:08:00.308
Yeah.

01:08:15.524 --> 01:08:19.694
Just a minute. Can you help me?

01:08:19.696 --> 01:08:21.261
Please.

01:08:22.665 --> 01:08:24.232
Thanks.

01:08:31.273 --> 01:08:33.741
I think that this is as far
as you're going to go.

01:08:33.743 --> 01:08:39.180
No, I just need a quick,
a quick power nap.

01:08:45.587 --> 01:08:48.389
All those people who
disappeared here.

01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:51.392
All those supposed accidents.

01:08:51.394 --> 01:08:53.328
Supposed?

01:08:53.330 --> 01:08:56.898
They seem like accidents to us,
but they're not.

01:08:56.899 --> 01:08:59.067
It's the earth reclaiming her
life.

01:09:03.639 --> 01:09:06.274
You're losing it, Dani.

01:09:06.276 --> 01:09:10.411
Animals must die in order for
us to feed and live,

01:09:10.412 --> 01:09:13.747
and we die in order to feed the
plants,

01:09:13.750 --> 01:09:16.484
which in turn feeds the earth,

01:09:16.486 --> 01:09:22.423
which in turn feeds the animals.

01:09:31.634 --> 01:09:36.571
This place needs blood to
replenish itself.

01:09:36.573 --> 01:09:39.307
What the hell
are you talking about?

01:09:40.843 --> 01:09:43.377
I need to get out of here,

01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:45.279
but it won't let me leave...

01:09:45.282 --> 01:09:46.714
Until you're dead.

01:09:46.716 --> 01:09:48.750
What did you say?

01:10:48.344 --> 01:10:50.845
Are you happy now?

01:12:14.563 --> 01:12:16.831
Let me out!

01:12:19.735 --> 01:12:22.437
Daniela?

01:12:23.806 --> 01:12:26.374
Who are you talking to?

01:12:29.111 --> 01:12:33.081
Where's gem?

01:12:33.083 --> 01:12:35.883
I thought you were dead.

01:12:40.055 --> 01:12:42.757
I stabbed it in the jugular.

01:12:42.759 --> 01:12:44.926
But I heard you scream.

01:12:44.928 --> 01:12:48.629
It hurt like hell when I used
my hand.

01:12:48.631 --> 01:12:51.232
The wound is still open.

01:12:52.468 --> 01:12:55.236
Where's gem?

01:13:01.009 --> 01:13:03.111
What happened to her?

01:13:04.847 --> 01:13:07.548
Why are you covered in blood?

01:13:09.118 --> 01:13:12.320
We got attacked by a bear.

01:13:16.992 --> 01:13:19.293
Are you hurt?

01:13:21.363 --> 01:13:24.031
All right then. Well,

01:13:24.033 --> 01:13:26.934
I guess it's just me and you.

01:13:26.936 --> 01:13:29.604
We better get going.

01:14:18.353 --> 01:14:20.488
Wait.

01:14:20.490 --> 01:14:23.424
I just... I need a second.

01:14:34.102 --> 01:14:37.238
I'm so hungry.

01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:40.208
Oh, yeah.

01:14:57.960 --> 01:14:59.627
You're quitting?

01:14:59.629 --> 01:15:02.830
I've been meaning to for a
while now.

01:15:02.832 --> 01:15:05.500
Better late than never, I guess.

01:15:07.870 --> 01:15:09.837
It's not too late.

01:15:09.839 --> 01:15:12.240
You and I are going to get out
of here.

01:15:12.242 --> 01:15:15.042
You really think so?

01:15:15.044 --> 01:15:17.311
I know so.

01:15:19.882 --> 01:15:23.284
Well, if you can kill a bear
with that little knife,

01:15:23.286 --> 01:15:25.686
then I guess anything is
possible.

01:15:27.923 --> 01:15:31.025
No, I just got lucky.

01:15:31.027 --> 01:15:33.995
I was totally guessing where
the jugular was.

01:15:33.997 --> 01:15:35.696
I'm assuming it was the jugular

01:15:35.698 --> 01:15:37.331
cause when I stabbed it all
this blood

01:15:37.333 --> 01:15:39.333
started spraying everywhere.

01:15:39.335 --> 01:15:42.670
Wow. Can I see it?

01:15:56.652 --> 01:16:00.154
It doesn't look like much.

01:16:01.156 --> 01:16:04.358
I just hope we don't find
any more dead people.

01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:08.896
You know, I'm really sorry
i ever suggested this hike.

01:16:08.898 --> 01:16:12.233
I know you are.

01:16:12.235 --> 01:16:17.071
We're all big girls, and we all
agreed.

01:16:27.082 --> 01:16:28.749
You never did tell us who
brought you

01:16:28.751 --> 01:16:31.719
to this dreadful place before.

01:16:32.521 --> 01:16:36.824
Oh, some friends from college.

01:16:36.826 --> 01:16:40.294
Robert, Meg, and their friend,
Julian.

01:16:43.665 --> 01:16:45.433
Robert and Meg?

01:16:45.435 --> 01:16:47.735
Didn't I see you post on your
profile

01:16:47.737 --> 01:16:50.137
that they disappeared last year?

01:17:29.378 --> 01:17:32.480
You're up.

01:17:37.953 --> 01:17:40.421
Now...

01:17:40.423 --> 01:17:46.560
You're going to tell me
exactly what is going on here.

01:17:46.562 --> 01:17:49.563
You know what's going on.

01:17:49.565 --> 01:17:52.400
Did you kill all these people?

01:17:52.402 --> 01:17:53.868
Of course I didn't.

01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:55.736
And what about gem?

01:17:55.738 --> 01:17:57.505
Gem was already dead.

01:17:57.507 --> 01:17:59.340
She just didn't know it yet.

01:18:00.609 --> 01:18:02.510
Plus I was running out of food.

01:18:02.512 --> 01:18:05.446
Found your stash.

01:18:06.415 --> 01:18:09.917
What happened to your college
friends, huh?

01:18:09.919 --> 01:18:12.687
Julian brought us up here.

01:18:12.689 --> 01:18:15.656
Took us on that hike.

01:18:15.658 --> 01:18:18.793
First it was Robert,

01:18:18.795 --> 01:18:21.929
then it was Meg.

01:18:21.931 --> 01:18:26.233
They just seemed like
fluke accidents.

01:18:27.269 --> 01:18:29.837
And then when it was just
Julian and me,

01:18:29.839 --> 01:18:32.106
he told me the truth.

01:18:32.108 --> 01:18:33.874
What truth?

01:18:33.876 --> 01:18:35.776
About the curse.

01:18:35.778 --> 01:18:38.045
About what I had to do.

01:18:38.047 --> 01:18:40.147
Which is?

01:18:40.149 --> 01:18:42.249
It won't let us both out alive.

01:18:42.251 --> 01:18:44.285
It.

01:18:44.287 --> 01:18:48.589
It demands reparation. It
demands blood.

01:18:49.925 --> 01:18:52.460
So you brought us here to kill
us.

01:18:52.462 --> 01:18:56.030
Once I killed Julian, I knew.

01:18:56.032 --> 01:18:59.934
It told me that if I didn't
bring it more blood
then it would kill me too.

01:19:01.470 --> 01:19:04.238
We were your friends.

01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:06.474
No, you weren't.

01:19:06.476 --> 01:19:08.409
We stopped being friends the
second

01:19:08.411 --> 01:19:09.877
I got to high school.

01:19:09.879 --> 01:19:15.316
Then, you guys got ashamed
of me just cause I got
a little chubby.

01:19:15.318 --> 01:19:19.086
You have no idea how many times
i intervened

01:19:19.088 --> 01:19:21.455
to stop others from whooping
your ass.

01:19:21.457 --> 01:19:23.357
Yeah, right. You were right
there beside them,

01:19:23.359 --> 01:19:25.392
making fun of me the whole
time.

01:19:25.394 --> 01:19:28.496
Do you have any idea what that
did to me?

01:19:28.498 --> 01:19:29.830
Yeah, because just like you,

01:19:29.832 --> 01:19:31.499
I struggled to fit in.

01:19:31.501 --> 01:19:33.567
But twice, twice I got

01:19:33.569 --> 01:19:35.636
into a fight defending you.

01:19:35.638 --> 01:19:37.071
Remember when I was suspended

01:19:37.073 --> 01:19:38.706
from school for a week?

01:19:38.708 --> 01:19:41.776
If that's true, then
why didn't you tell me sooner?

01:19:43.211 --> 01:19:48.549
Because high school sucks
and peer pressure is a bitch.

01:19:48.551 --> 01:19:51.018
But that was a long time ago.

01:19:51.020 --> 01:19:54.855
Most of us got past all that.

01:19:54.857 --> 01:19:57.458
Easy for you to say.

01:19:57.460 --> 01:20:00.394
Fine.

01:20:01.429 --> 01:20:05.366
Stay bitter for the rest of
your life, bitch.

01:20:05.368 --> 01:20:08.002
Wait a second. Wait, Nancy,

01:20:08.004 --> 01:20:11.172
are you just going to leave me
tied up like this?

01:20:11.174 --> 01:20:14.508
I don't trust you not to
follow me and kill me.

01:20:14.510 --> 01:20:17.812
You seem to really believe
all that crap you're saying.

01:20:19.047 --> 01:20:22.750
As soon as I find help,
I'll have them look for you.

01:20:22.752 --> 01:20:25.820
You know, Nancy,
you might as well just kill me.

01:20:25.822 --> 01:20:31.292
Cause what it's going to do
is way worse than anything
you can do.

01:20:31.294 --> 01:20:33.761
You really are nuts.

01:20:35.731 --> 01:20:38.132
It's starting.

01:23:44.053 --> 01:23:46.720
I'll bring them to you,

01:23:46.722 --> 01:23:48.922
I swear.
