WEBVTT

00:01.600 --> 00:05.520
It's an entirely new species.
They seem to be spreading much faster.

00:06.120 --> 00:10.200
The worms just happened to be
found where they would do the most harm.

00:10.880 --> 00:15.520
There was a strange light and bursts
of sound before the Juno went down.

00:15.760 --> 00:17.760
Secure the station, and get back here.

00:17.920 --> 00:19.880
Everything has to be
by the book with her.

00:21.320 --> 00:24.640
They can't be
occurring independent from one another.

00:24.800 --> 00:26.600
There must be some connection.

00:26.840 --> 00:29.320
We found an organic substance
in the brainstem of a whale.

00:29.560 --> 00:32.080
Is the substance
causing the changes in behaviour?

00:32.760 --> 00:36.560
The wavelength of the light and the
frequency of the sound are identical.

00:37.520 --> 00:39.720
I was wrong not to trust you.
I am sorry.

01:05.800 --> 01:08.000
-Stop!
-Charlie!

01:17.280 --> 01:20.240
-No! Leave me! Let me go!
-We can't go.

01:20.400 --> 01:22.280
Leave me! No!

01:38.680 --> 01:41.080
Sigur, it's me.

01:42.840 --> 01:44.640
I just wanted you to know...

01:46.680 --> 01:49.600
I can't imagine a life
without you either.

02:05.440 --> 02:09.000
...has also been devastated,
with early reports suggesting

02:09.160 --> 02:12.040
several coastal villages
have been destroyed,

02:12.200 --> 02:14.920
and more than 350 people
reported missing...

02:15.080 --> 02:17.520
...whose own lives had been
irrevocably altered...

02:17.680 --> 02:20.040
...not only here on the coast,
but all around the world.

02:20.200 --> 02:23.360
The extent of the catastrophe
is still being determined.

02:23.520 --> 02:26.800
More than 700 people are missing
in Trondheim, Norway...

02:26.960 --> 02:29.680
...population trying to move inland,
away from the coasts.

02:29.840 --> 02:32.440
Great Britain has also been devastated,

02:32.600 --> 02:34.400
with early reports suggesting

02:34.560 --> 02:37.720
several coastal villages
have been destroyed...

02:42.920 --> 02:44.160
Charlie?

03:13.320 --> 03:14.440
Sigur...

03:15.920 --> 03:17.400
It's me.

03:18.320 --> 03:19.800
I just wanted you to know...

03:23.080 --> 03:25.720
I can't imagine
a life without you either.

05:09.760 --> 05:11.880
Hello, Mr. Johnson? One question.

05:12.040 --> 05:14.160
-Mr. Johnson?
-Thank you.

05:15.880 --> 05:18.320
I'm really sorry, I'm late.
Can I go ahead?

05:18.560 --> 05:20.280
I'm so sorry. Really sorry.

05:20.440 --> 05:22.360
I'm sorry, I have to go ahead. I'm late.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.480
Come closer. Please wait.

05:27.040 --> 05:28.080
You can go.

05:28.320 --> 05:31.480
If I could ask you to turn your
attention to the screen:

05:32.080 --> 05:35.080
In red, you see where the infected crabs

05:35.320 --> 05:37.040
first came ashore in Japan.

05:37.920 --> 05:39.400
Ma'am, can I see your badge, please?

05:39.560 --> 05:43.960
Following the infestation of
infected crabs swarming coastal areas

05:44.120 --> 05:46.040
in South Africa, Brazil,

05:46.200 --> 05:47.800
Morocco and India...

05:47.960 --> 05:50.440
-How are you?
-Good. It's good to see you.

05:53.640 --> 05:55.560
From the initial point of contact,

05:55.720 --> 05:59.200
the bacteria has infiltrated
every source of water,

05:59.360 --> 06:03.200
both man-made and natural,
everywhere it was introduced.

06:05.080 --> 06:08.600
Forty percent of the Earth's
population lives on the coast.

06:08.840 --> 06:11.440
If the swarms of crabs appear elsewhere,

06:12.040 --> 06:15.720
we will be looking at one of the largest
displacements of human beings

06:15.880 --> 06:17.680
the world has ever seen.

06:20.480 --> 06:22.160
-Dr. Roche?
-Yes.

06:22.720 --> 06:25.560
We have been aware of the effect

06:25.720 --> 06:29.320
that warming of the ocean
will have on rising sea levels,

06:29.480 --> 06:32.680
and the number of people who
will be displaced as a result,

06:32.840 --> 06:37.600
as well as the effect it will have
on the pathogenicity of bacteria

06:37.760 --> 06:40.760
as well as viruses, fungi, parasites...

06:40.920 --> 06:41.920
Yeah.

06:42.080 --> 06:44.560
Sigur, are you watching this?

06:44.720 --> 06:46.200
I am.

06:47.600 --> 06:49.160
I'm gonna call you back.

06:49.320 --> 06:51.160
Dr. Roche, so...

06:51.760 --> 06:54.600
The emergence of a more deadly strain

06:54.760 --> 06:57.400
is unfortunately not a surprise.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.920
No, it's not.

07:00.560 --> 07:03.840
But what we could not have predicted
was that it would be carried ashore

07:04.000 --> 07:06.760
by an invasion of an unknown species

07:06.920 --> 07:08.800
which seems to have no other function

07:08.960 --> 07:11.920
than to infect us
with the bacteria it carries.

07:12.480 --> 07:13.920
Dr. Roche.

07:14.080 --> 07:15.920
Are you suggesting that the crabs

07:16.080 --> 07:18.400
deliberately polluted our waterways?

07:18.640 --> 07:20.680
I'm not suggesting it, Mr. Peak.

07:20.840 --> 07:22.240
The data is.

07:33.960 --> 07:34.960
Hello?

07:35.120 --> 07:37.000
Riku, hi, it's Sigur.

07:37.680 --> 07:39.800
I'd like to talk to Dr. Roche.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.560
Do you think you could arrange that?

07:43.040 --> 07:46.600
-I'll speak to her this afternoon.
-Good, good.

07:46.840 --> 07:48.520
Also, will Leon Anawak be speaking?

07:48.680 --> 07:51.480
Or anybody from
the Vancouver Island Marine Institute?

07:51.720 --> 07:54.160
He's not on the roster.
Why are you asking?

07:55.560 --> 07:57.920
-I'd like to meet him.
-When?

07:58.160 --> 07:59.640
As soon as possible.

08:00.280 --> 08:02.280
Do you think there's a chance?

08:03.360 --> 08:04.720
I'll see what I can do.

08:39.760 --> 08:41.960
You here to tell me to get inland?

08:42.120 --> 08:44.680
This is going to get worse
before it gets better.

08:49.520 --> 08:51.000
This is our home.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.040
I know.

08:59.560 --> 09:01.480
I remember you out there.

09:01.960 --> 09:03.760
Half the height you are now.

09:04.720 --> 09:07.960
Running from waves,
your mother chasing you down the beach.

09:09.000 --> 09:13.160
I reckon you were more at home out there
than you were between any four walls.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.200
You're right.

09:17.480 --> 09:18.880
Still am.

09:22.320 --> 09:23.560
Yeah.

09:23.720 --> 09:26.520
I appreciate the concern, Leon.
We all do.

09:28.400 --> 09:30.480
But until Murray Cove is gone,

09:33.240 --> 09:35.320
most of us will be staying here.

09:42.800 --> 09:44.680
I am proud of you, kid.

09:46.400 --> 09:48.080
There's a comfort in knowing

09:48.240 --> 09:50.520
you're right where
you're supposed to be.

09:54.520 --> 09:56.000
Thank you.

10:08.560 --> 10:11.520
You really think moving inland's
gonna make a difference?

10:12.840 --> 10:14.360
Safer than the coast.

10:16.600 --> 10:18.160
I'm with Kit on this one.

10:18.320 --> 10:20.760
I mean... Move inland? For what?

10:21.800 --> 10:24.160
Facing it head on, on my own terms?

10:24.320 --> 10:25.920
Sounds better to me.

10:28.080 --> 10:30.520
-While I'm gone, you'll...
-Keep an eye on things?

10:30.680 --> 10:33.480
Yeah, I'll do my best.

10:34.480 --> 10:37.640
Let's just hope everything's
still standing when you get back.

10:45.560 --> 10:46.840
Do us proud, kid.

11:28.280 --> 11:30.840
Okay, so if we go on the assumption

11:31.000 --> 11:32.880
that the attacks were not random...

11:33.040 --> 11:34.720
Which I don't think they are.

11:35.520 --> 11:39.640
Right, well, that would suggest
that they were strategic,

11:39.800 --> 11:42.120
that they were part of an overall plan.

11:42.640 --> 11:44.040
I know how it sounds,

11:44.200 --> 11:47.360
I've racked my brain
to find another explanation.

11:47.520 --> 11:49.080
And you can't?

11:49.320 --> 11:50.320
No.

11:51.080 --> 11:53.440
And what's more alarming
is that I think that

11:53.600 --> 11:56.360
whoever's behind it is learning.

11:57.680 --> 11:59.120
Learning?

11:59.280 --> 12:01.720
The strain of bacterium
we found in the lobsters

12:01.960 --> 12:04.800
was brought ashore by
the fishermen who caught them.

12:05.040 --> 12:08.640
The infected crabs
came ashore by themselves.

12:10.600 --> 12:14.480
You understand why I decided not
to mention that to the Council?

12:16.440 --> 12:19.360
Well, as it happens, I agree with you.

12:19.520 --> 12:21.040
As do several others.

12:22.520 --> 12:24.040
Would you be free to meet?

12:25.240 --> 12:27.680
-In Trondheim?
-No. In Kiel.

12:27.920 --> 12:29.680
Institute for Marine Biology.

12:29.840 --> 12:32.040
I think you know Katharina Lehmann.

12:32.640 --> 12:35.360
Not well, but yes,
we have spoken a few times.

12:37.280 --> 12:39.200
The thing is...

12:41.160 --> 12:43.400
I promised my children I'd be back.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.800
Yeah, I know it's a lot to ask.

12:50.400 --> 12:52.520
-When?
-Tomorrow.

12:57.840 --> 12:59.640
Okay, I'll be there.

13:28.440 --> 13:33.040
Hey, Rahim. Leon Anawak's on his way.
Could you go down and meet him?

13:33.200 --> 13:34.600
And bring him to the lab?

13:34.760 --> 13:36.840
-Sure.
-Yeah? Thanks.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.440
Leon Anawak?

13:57.400 --> 13:58.840
Yes.

13:59.080 --> 14:01.920
I'm Rahim Amir,
I work with Professor Lehmann.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.040
-Good flight?
-Never flown on a private jet before.

14:07.600 --> 14:10.280
You and me both. Please.

14:11.440 --> 14:14.960
The cafeteria is shut, but we have
coffee and sandwiches in the office

14:15.120 --> 14:17.720
if you'd like to eat something
before we get started.

14:18.600 --> 14:20.200
You spoke to the others?

14:21.320 --> 14:23.680
Yeah. CÃ©cile, Leon...

14:23.920 --> 14:26.120
-Professor Lehmann?
-No.

14:26.840 --> 14:30.040
No, I thought it better
to wait for some back-up.

14:46.840 --> 14:49.800
In recent days... weeks,

14:49.960 --> 14:53.240
we have all seen things
that should not be.

14:53.400 --> 14:55.880
And yet are.

14:56.880 --> 15:01.000
Populations of marine species
growing at a rate so exponential,

15:01.240 --> 15:03.520
it seems to defy biology.

15:04.960 --> 15:08.040
Whales behaving as if possessed...

15:09.520 --> 15:12.200
The eruption and channeling of water

15:12.360 --> 15:15.800
from long dormant sites
over vast distances...

15:17.200 --> 15:19.080
Species infected with

15:19.320 --> 15:22.120
mutant strains of bacteria,
poisoning our water.

15:23.040 --> 15:28.600
I believe something is behind the events
we've all witnessed firsthand.

15:30.800 --> 15:36.320
Something that has weaponized
the seas against us.

15:43.560 --> 15:48.440
If these... phenomena
are in fact connected,

15:49.640 --> 15:53.600
if they're outside the bounds
of what we currently know to be true.

15:53.840 --> 15:57.520
That they are somehow the work of

15:58.240 --> 16:04.080
some sort of intelligent life force
which wants to drive us from the ocean.

16:05.200 --> 16:07.680
Is that what you're suggesting?

16:08.960 --> 16:10.000
Yes.

16:11.320 --> 16:12.360
But...

16:13.160 --> 16:16.000
But we've hardly scratched the surface

16:16.240 --> 16:19.240
of what might be a
plausible explanation.

16:19.840 --> 16:21.400
Professor Lehmann.

16:23.200 --> 16:24.840
That's true, I agree.

16:25.080 --> 16:27.200
But instinct tells me
this is something else.

16:27.360 --> 16:30.320
Leon, I'd never question the importance

16:30.480 --> 16:32.640
of following your instinct,

16:32.800 --> 16:35.960
or how intuition has been the impetus

16:36.120 --> 16:38.440
for so many breakthroughs in our field.

16:38.680 --> 16:43.360
But to abandon
everything we know to be true...

16:45.200 --> 16:47.000
and jump to such a conclusion?

16:47.160 --> 16:48.520
Katharina, it's because

16:48.760 --> 16:52.760
all I know to be true is no longer true
that I began to look elsewhere.

16:53.640 --> 16:56.720
And I cannot help but think that

16:57.480 --> 17:01.120
what's happening in the sea
is in some way a reaction,

17:02.080 --> 17:05.000
a response, to what we have done to it.

17:08.920 --> 17:12.240
CÃ©cile, you are asking me

17:14.040 --> 17:16.520
to unearth the foundation

17:16.680 --> 17:21.280
on which my training,
my research, my teaching,

17:21.440 --> 17:23.080
has been built.

17:30.280 --> 17:31.800
I can't.

17:33.360 --> 17:34.840
I'm sorry.

17:37.440 --> 17:39.080
I shall let you to it.

17:42.400 --> 17:46.320
But before I do, I must warn you.

17:47.920 --> 17:51.480
This could be a very
dangerous road to be going down.

17:53.320 --> 17:54.720
At a time like this,

17:54.880 --> 17:57.760
with the world so unstable,

17:57.920 --> 18:02.280
to suggest that we cannot
find the truth in science

18:02.440 --> 18:04.200
as we know and understand it,

18:04.440 --> 18:08.280
you must realize the level of disruption

18:08.440 --> 18:11.480
that might be unleashed
onto the psyche of the world.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.760
Professor Lehmann.

18:36.040 --> 18:37.240
Charlie.

18:38.120 --> 18:40.720
You really don't think there's
a chance that we're right?

18:40.960 --> 18:44.440
It's not about chances,
it's about probability.

18:45.120 --> 18:46.840
And when probability is low,

18:47.000 --> 18:49.040
then it's wiser to proceed with caution.

18:49.800 --> 18:53.400
-Which is not what you're doing.
-We don't have time for caution.

18:56.560 --> 18:58.480
It's easy to say that.

18:59.320 --> 19:02.600
But right now is the time
to be more careful than ever.

19:03.560 --> 19:05.920
Your reputation is on the line.
All of theirs are.

19:06.080 --> 19:08.120
What good will that do, if...

19:08.360 --> 19:10.760
You still need a good reputation

19:10.920 --> 19:13.200
if you want people to listen to you.

19:13.360 --> 19:15.160
When you believe something is true,

19:15.320 --> 19:17.400
you pursue it, despite the risks.

19:17.560 --> 19:20.720
-I learned that from you.
-I understand your idealism.

19:21.720 --> 19:23.280
But in my experience,

19:23.440 --> 19:26.160
taking this kind of risk
tends to end badly.

19:36.640 --> 19:38.400
The slots are all thirty minutes.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.720
If your proposal is selected,
there is a follow-up with the council.

19:42.960 --> 19:45.840
All supporting documentation
needs to be sent in advance.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.760
Yeah, we're working on that as we speak.

19:50.560 --> 19:53.160
Travel is getting
increasingly difficult.

19:54.080 --> 19:56.440
I'll have my office make arrangements.

19:56.680 --> 19:59.480
I will need the names
of those accompanying you.

20:00.520 --> 20:02.480
CÃ©cile Roche. Leon Anawak.

20:02.640 --> 20:04.160
Charlie Wagner.

20:04.320 --> 20:06.880
And Rahim Amir.

20:09.600 --> 20:11.080
And Professor Lehmann?

20:14.920 --> 20:19.600
Unfortunately, Professor Lehmann
won't be joining us.

20:21.920 --> 20:24.640
She has a different view?

20:29.000 --> 20:30.120
She does. Yes.

20:30.280 --> 20:33.120
-But, Riku, I assure you...
-You don't need to assure me.

20:33.720 --> 20:38.360
Professor Lehmann's name would've added
a credibility to your presentation,

20:38.520 --> 20:42.160
but if your findings are sound,
they will speak for themselves.

20:44.040 --> 20:45.880
Thank you. Thank you, Riku.

20:47.840 --> 20:49.880
How long have you studied under her?

20:51.360 --> 20:52.840
Professor Lehmann?

20:53.840 --> 20:55.200
Three years.

20:57.320 --> 20:58.720
Two more to go.

20:58.880 --> 21:00.640
If I want to finish my PhD.

21:01.560 --> 21:05.640
It's probably not the best time
to be making decisions about the future.

21:07.160 --> 21:08.760
No, probably not.

21:12.600 --> 21:14.680
When you spoke
in front of the Council...

21:16.440 --> 21:17.840
You said we were looking at

21:18.000 --> 21:21.040
the largest displacement of human beings
the world has ever seen.

21:21.200 --> 21:22.640
I did, yes.

21:24.280 --> 21:25.760
Do you think...

21:26.800 --> 21:29.120
Do you think it's possible that

21:29.280 --> 21:33.240
this intelligence doesn't
actually want to destroy us?

21:34.360 --> 21:37.120
Do you think maybe it just wants
to drive us from the water

21:37.280 --> 21:39.400
and keep us from coming back?

21:39.560 --> 21:41.200
I would like to believe so.

21:41.360 --> 21:45.400
I'd like to believe its intentions
are defensive and not aggressive.

21:48.400 --> 21:49.880
But you aren't sure.

21:51.400 --> 21:53.520
Right now, no, I can't be.

21:55.320 --> 21:58.680
None of us can, unfortunately.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.120
But I think we have all learned

22:03.280 --> 22:06.120
to not hold too tightly to assumptions.

22:06.280 --> 22:08.080
There'll probably be more.

22:10.040 --> 22:13.720
"Once we've eliminated the impossible,

22:14.280 --> 22:18.160
whatever's left, however improbable,

22:18.320 --> 22:19.840
must be the truth."

22:22.600 --> 22:24.080
Who said that?

22:26.000 --> 22:27.520
Sherlock Holmes.

22:29.920 --> 22:31.560
I think it fits.

22:35.800 --> 22:37.280
What is that?

22:42.200 --> 22:44.120
Just something my mother gave to me.

22:46.840 --> 22:48.360
May I?

22:58.440 --> 23:00.120
Does it mean something?

23:02.760 --> 23:05.400
When I was little, I used to ask
so many questions.

23:07.080 --> 23:09.120
I remember driving my mom crazy.

23:11.280 --> 23:13.560
She'd limit the number of things
I could ask,

23:13.720 --> 23:15.680
so I had to be more selective.

23:20.760 --> 23:24.200
There came a point when I was
asking things she couldn't answer.

23:26.400 --> 23:28.080
She gave me that.

23:29.120 --> 23:31.040
She said it was a symbol.

23:33.680 --> 23:35.200
For the unknown.

23:38.360 --> 23:40.760
Of course it was just for me,
to ease my mind.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.480
Did it work?

23:47.680 --> 23:49.160
For a while.

23:51.600 --> 23:52.600
But...

23:54.400 --> 23:57.880
I don't think I'm the kind of person
who could accept the unknown.

23:59.800 --> 24:01.240
Neither am I.

24:25.440 --> 24:26.720
Enough?

24:28.400 --> 24:29.400
Yes.

24:44.640 --> 24:45.640
Why whales?

24:49.080 --> 24:50.560
Grew up on the ocean,

24:51.840 --> 24:53.320
in British Columbia.

24:54.440 --> 24:56.480
It's part of the culture there.

24:57.800 --> 24:59.680
I think most people remember being kids,

24:59.840 --> 25:02.040
in boats, on the beach,

25:03.440 --> 25:07.400
seeing the burst of an orca's spray
or the flick of a grey's fluke.

25:08.200 --> 25:10.880
I saw an orca,
when I was in the Shetlands.

25:11.280 --> 25:13.280
I kept going back out
for a couple of days,

25:13.440 --> 25:15.680
hoping to see it again, but I never did.

25:17.200 --> 25:19.600
They're a lot shyer
than most people think.

25:22.240 --> 25:23.280
What?

25:24.840 --> 25:26.800
Professor Lehmann hates it

25:27.040 --> 25:29.240
when we talk about animals like people.

25:29.400 --> 25:30.960
But we all do it.

25:36.680 --> 25:39.840
I don't think people realize
how similar they are to us.

25:41.800 --> 25:43.560
They'll travel weeks, months,

25:45.280 --> 25:47.720
to meet a whale whose song they heard.

25:48.200 --> 25:50.240
The devotion to each other.

25:53.240 --> 25:56.520
I don't see how you can perceive it
as anything but fascinating.

25:58.680 --> 26:00.160
As beautiful.

26:58.800 --> 27:01.720
To recap, Dr. Johanson,

27:01.880 --> 27:04.560
and please tell me if
I don't get this straight.

27:04.800 --> 27:06.960
You and your team believe

27:07.120 --> 27:11.440
that the catastrophes of the past weeks
are more than linked.

27:12.160 --> 27:14.720
That new species of marine life,

27:14.960 --> 27:19.080
bivalves, crustaceans,
to name a few, have mutated

27:19.960 --> 27:23.360
to carry out deliberate attacks
on humanity?

27:23.600 --> 27:25.240
That's correct.

27:27.320 --> 27:30.680
And that certain species
of whales have been altered

27:30.840 --> 27:33.720
on a chemical and biological level,

27:34.720 --> 27:38.040
prompting them to act
with total aggression,

27:38.200 --> 27:40.840
with no regard for their own well-being

27:41.000 --> 27:43.040
or even survival.

27:43.280 --> 27:44.640
To push us inland,

27:44.800 --> 27:49.200
to make coastline of every country
around the world uninhabitable.

27:49.800 --> 27:51.520
And all of this,

27:51.680 --> 27:53.080
all of it,

27:53.240 --> 27:55.800
is the work of an...

27:57.720 --> 27:59.200
An intelligence.

28:01.080 --> 28:03.600
Such as an alien intelligence?

28:03.760 --> 28:05.720
I didn't say alien.

28:05.960 --> 28:09.680
We have many intelligent species
on this planet, Dr. Johanson.

28:09.840 --> 28:10.880
We do.

28:11.040 --> 28:14.280
But we believe that
this intelligence surpasses

28:14.440 --> 28:16.360
anything we've seen in other species,

28:17.120 --> 28:18.520
perhaps even our own.

28:18.680 --> 28:20.080
What we are seeing,

28:20.240 --> 28:22.360
the alteration of existing species,

28:22.520 --> 28:24.600
the creation of new ones,

28:27.200 --> 28:30.000
is far beyond anything
that we are able to do.

28:30.240 --> 28:32.760
Perhaps will ever be able to do.

28:34.120 --> 28:35.960
Can we assume, Dr. Johanson,

28:36.120 --> 28:40.480
that you have considered
other, less original ideas?

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
I have.

28:43.320 --> 28:45.720
I think we all have.

28:45.960 --> 28:47.440
Many times.

28:47.960 --> 28:50.320
A lab experiment gone wrong.

28:50.480 --> 28:52.600
Decaying nuclear waste containers

28:52.840 --> 28:55.480
leaking radioactive material
into the ocean.

28:55.640 --> 28:57.600
A hostile state.

28:57.760 --> 29:01.080
Bio-terrorists
genetically modifying species

29:01.240 --> 29:03.000
to use in a coordinated attack...

29:03.160 --> 29:06.120
As many as I'm sure
you've asked yourself.

29:06.280 --> 29:10.720
And if you've come up with
some plausible, less original idea

29:11.800 --> 29:14.560
that explains all the phenomena
that we have witnessed,

29:14.720 --> 29:16.680
then please tell us.

29:18.560 --> 29:20.520
Because we have not.

29:22.480 --> 29:27.000
Nor, by the presentations
we've heard so far, has anyone else.

29:29.520 --> 29:32.200
And this new intelligence,

29:32.880 --> 29:36.680
could I ask what
you are calling it, or them?

29:37.760 --> 29:42.160
For the time being, I have taken
to calling them the "Yrr."

29:44.520 --> 29:46.680
-The Yrr?
-Correct.

29:48.720 --> 29:53.280
How would you proceed in the event
that we consider your thesis?

29:54.840 --> 29:59.120
I would suggest, as a first step,
we try to establish contact.

29:59.360 --> 30:01.520
-Contact?
-With the Yrr.

30:02.600 --> 30:06.560
And if you were able
to contact them, Dr. Johanson,

30:07.280 --> 30:08.600
what would you say?

30:11.000 --> 30:13.240
What I would say to any invading force

30:13.400 --> 30:15.400
that I stood no chance in combatting:

30:18.320 --> 30:20.160
I'd ask them to stop.

30:20.400 --> 30:22.640
And do everything I could

30:22.800 --> 30:24.520
to try to come to terms.

30:31.760 --> 30:34.240
One final question, Dr. Johanson.

30:37.560 --> 30:40.800
You're on the faculty of
Trondheim University?

30:40.960 --> 30:43.840
I am currently on sabbatical.

30:45.360 --> 30:49.040
And you have been consulting
for Hovedstad Energy.

30:50.840 --> 30:51.960
Correct.

30:52.120 --> 30:54.320
Which financed your research?

30:55.240 --> 30:59.720
They financed the trip during which
we discovered the Sirsoe methanicola.

31:01.400 --> 31:03.720
Are there other sources of funding?

31:04.960 --> 31:09.440
The Mifune Foundation has offered
to cover our travel and accommodation.

31:10.160 --> 31:13.280
But you haven't received any support

31:13.440 --> 31:15.400
from the institutions

31:15.560 --> 31:19.680
with which you and your
colleagues are associated.

31:23.400 --> 31:24.440
No.

31:27.080 --> 31:28.760
Not at the moment, no.

31:33.080 --> 31:35.080
If there are no other questions?

31:35.960 --> 31:37.600
Thank you, Dr. Johanson.

31:37.760 --> 31:39.280
Thank you all.

31:49.560 --> 31:52.600
Y'all do come up
with some interesting stuff.

31:53.320 --> 31:55.720
Alicia did promise
it would be worth the trip.

31:55.960 --> 31:57.600
And she did not disappoint.

31:57.760 --> 32:00.640
Sam looked into the sound we picked up
when we tagged the whale.

32:02.080 --> 32:04.880
They're all variations of rhythms,

32:05.040 --> 32:07.000
clicks, scratches,

32:07.160 --> 32:09.440
all the same pitch and frequency.

32:10.280 --> 32:11.920
All earmarks of a language.

32:12.160 --> 32:14.400
The question is what kind of language?

32:14.640 --> 32:16.200
I trawled through our records.

32:16.360 --> 32:18.360
ERIEL keeps logs of sounds

32:18.520 --> 32:21.360
that originate from the Earth
as well as the galaxy.

32:23.040 --> 32:26.520
We picked up the same signal.

32:28.800 --> 32:29.800
From space?

32:31.320 --> 32:33.120
Much more close to home.

32:33.880 --> 32:36.920
Antarctica and the Arctic Ocean.

32:38.560 --> 32:42.200
Now I'm checking with colleagues
at other organizations around the world

32:42.360 --> 32:44.800
to see if
they've picked up anything similar.

32:46.920 --> 32:49.240
-What do you think?
-About the Yrr?

32:51.200 --> 32:52.520
I think...

32:53.120 --> 32:57.440
I wouldn't be much of an astrophysicist
if I didn't think it were possible.

32:58.080 --> 33:00.240
And if I asked, would you join us?

33:01.760 --> 33:03.160
What would you say?

33:11.440 --> 33:14.160
The team we have, we all know the water,

33:15.480 --> 33:17.600
but none of us could do what you do...

33:19.280 --> 33:20.760
Would I join you?

33:23.280 --> 33:25.480
Yes, I would.

33:41.400 --> 33:42.960
Thank you for coming.

33:44.320 --> 33:46.640
Mr. Mifune, your six-fifteen.

33:49.800 --> 33:51.320
Dr. Johanson.

33:53.840 --> 33:55.320
Fifteen-minute slots, huh?

33:55.560 --> 33:57.320
You must be a busy man.

33:57.480 --> 34:01.360
Fifteen-minute slots
so my meetings stay on point.

34:02.680 --> 34:04.920
Over the years I have come to realize

34:05.080 --> 34:08.720
that time management
is as valuable a skill as any.

34:09.720 --> 34:12.320
It allows me to spend time on the things

34:12.800 --> 34:14.800
I'm truly passionate about.

34:16.240 --> 34:20.160
I'm sorry to hear the council
did not approve your mission.

34:20.840 --> 34:24.480
So am I. Although I can't say
that I'm surprised.

34:24.720 --> 34:27.360
You may not have convinced them,

34:27.520 --> 34:32.160
but you have convinced me, Dr. Johanson.

34:35.240 --> 34:38.760
I have made my fortune
off the planet's gifts.

34:40.400 --> 34:42.360
Including its oceans.

34:43.240 --> 34:47.280
And I believe it's my duty
to repay the favor,

34:48.280 --> 34:53.840
by doing all I can
to undo the damage we have done,

34:54.000 --> 34:56.960
and limit the damage done in the future.

34:58.960 --> 35:04.480
Which is why I would like to
fund a new venture.

35:05.520 --> 35:08.440
If you are prepared
to accept my support.

35:10.080 --> 35:12.440
I would like to back your mission.

35:13.600 --> 35:16.880
I, like you,

35:18.600 --> 35:20.960
wish to know if what you say is true.

35:23.840 --> 35:27.000
Does this "Yrr" exist?

35:34.280 --> 35:36.400
I didn't think this day would come.

35:37.080 --> 35:39.200
I... doubt any of us did.

35:40.040 --> 35:42.200
But now that it has,
it's up to you to decide

35:42.360 --> 35:44.720
whether or not
you want to go through with it.

35:45.720 --> 35:48.640
Samantha, Alicia: We've just met.

35:49.440 --> 35:52.120
But the high regards
with which Leon speaks of you,

35:52.280 --> 35:55.120
and of course
what I know about your work,

35:55.280 --> 35:56.800
I have no doubt

35:56.960 --> 36:00.120
that your joining us would be
of great benefit to our mission.

36:00.360 --> 36:03.200
We sail in forty-eight hours.

36:04.320 --> 36:07.560
Once on board, there'll be a
complete communication black-out.

36:07.720 --> 36:10.040
This is to protect
the security of our mission,

36:10.200 --> 36:12.880
and whatever we discover.

36:14.000 --> 36:17.040
So, those of you who can go home

36:17.200 --> 36:19.520
and make it back by the time we sail,

36:20.600 --> 36:24.960
well, this could be your last
chance to say goodbye.

36:26.680 --> 36:29.040
Because there are no guarantees.

36:29.200 --> 36:31.960
I can't guarantee
the success of the mission.

36:32.120 --> 36:33.920
There are no guarantees

36:34.640 --> 36:37.040
that we will make it back alive, so...

36:38.560 --> 36:42.200
Those of you who feel that you
do not want to carry forward,

36:42.960 --> 36:45.760
I think I speak for everyone
when I say I understand.

36:46.680 --> 36:48.080
I understand,

36:48.240 --> 36:51.520
and it will in no way reflect
poorly on your character.

36:54.400 --> 36:57.120
But for those who do,

36:58.640 --> 37:00.400
I'll see you at the airport.

37:08.240 --> 37:09.720
Excuse me?

37:11.960 --> 37:14.800
I think I'm going to call it a night.
It's been a long day.

37:18.640 --> 37:20.080
Thank you.

37:22.800 --> 37:24.920
Charlie, I...

37:29.160 --> 37:30.680
You're not coming.

37:33.120 --> 37:34.720
I wish I could.

37:35.880 --> 37:37.520
I wish I were like you, but I'm not.

37:37.680 --> 37:39.640
Of course you are.
What are you talking about?

37:39.800 --> 37:43.000
The mission will not succeed
or fail based on my input.

37:43.880 --> 37:45.680
But it may without yours.

37:49.320 --> 37:51.040
I'm going to go home.

37:53.040 --> 37:55.800
I'm going to meet Max
and head down to Mom and Dad

37:56.400 --> 37:58.200
and see my new niece

37:58.440 --> 38:00.240
and ride it out with them.

38:03.280 --> 38:05.920
And you can come and tell me about it

38:06.080 --> 38:08.200
when you get back.

38:37.160 --> 38:38.640
It's Mom.

38:56.760 --> 38:58.560
I didn't mean to wake you.

38:59.720 --> 39:01.200
Alicia.

39:02.080 --> 39:04.040
It's a shame that it took this long

39:04.280 --> 39:06.640
for you to get invited
to a proper conference.

39:06.880 --> 39:09.520
My conferences are proper.

39:09.680 --> 39:12.560
Wait, you never get to stay
in hotels like this.

39:12.720 --> 39:14.840
Good thing you didn't marry me
for the perks.

39:15.000 --> 39:18.120
That would have proven
very disappointing if I did.

39:19.960 --> 39:21.520
Look, it's Mom.

39:21.760 --> 39:23.240
Stop talking nonsense...

39:23.480 --> 39:24.960
Mom, what are you doing...

39:26.160 --> 39:28.080
You didn't say you were coming.

39:33.520 --> 39:36.360
I thought
you were coming back last week.

39:36.600 --> 39:39.440
I'm sorry, I had to stay
in Geneva a few days longer.

39:42.760 --> 39:45.560
-I spoke to Dr. Coletti.
-There's nothing to worry about.

39:45.720 --> 39:47.440
Yes, I know, but...

39:47.600 --> 39:49.280
It's a simple procedure.

39:49.440 --> 39:51.440
A couple days' rest and I'll be fine.

39:52.120 --> 39:55.480
You should have someone in the house,
just until I get back.

39:56.440 --> 39:58.080
You're not staying?

39:58.800 --> 40:01.320
I have to go on a research
mission to the Arctic Ocean.

40:01.480 --> 40:04.640
The Arctic Ocean?
You want to go out in the ocean? Now?

40:04.800 --> 40:06.160
It's my job.

40:07.000 --> 40:10.280
You come back to tell me not to worry,
then give me a reason to worry.

40:10.440 --> 40:13.280
Since when do you need a reason?
You worry all the time.

40:13.520 --> 40:15.680
Of course I do. I'm your mother.

40:18.200 --> 40:20.440
This running around,
all over the world...

40:20.600 --> 40:23.880
-Alicia, this is not living.
-I'm living my way, Mom.

40:24.040 --> 40:26.440
Not yours. That doesn't mean it's wrong.

40:26.600 --> 40:28.480
I want you to be happy.

40:30.040 --> 40:32.120
To do whatever gives you joy.

40:33.080 --> 40:36.000
But I also want time
to speak to my daughter,

40:36.720 --> 40:39.040
I want her to tell me about her life.

40:43.160 --> 40:45.040
Next visit, I promise.

40:45.880 --> 40:49.120
But for now, can we just
enjoy our time together?

40:49.280 --> 40:51.400
Cook? Listen to music?

40:53.000 --> 40:55.920
Yes, but I'm cooking.

40:56.520 --> 40:58.120
-And picking the music.
-Okay.

41:03.600 --> 41:05.400
If you say no, I won't...

41:05.640 --> 41:07.920
Do you really think I'm gonna say no?

41:08.600 --> 41:10.840
Sam, who do you take me for?

41:11.400 --> 41:14.920
I don't know what will happen out there.

41:15.640 --> 41:17.560
You don't know
what'll happen here, either.

41:17.720 --> 41:19.720
You know what I mean.

41:20.320 --> 41:24.080
Sam, this is something that
goes beyond what you or I want.

41:25.720 --> 41:27.480
Will you be proven right?

41:27.640 --> 41:29.080
Who knows?

41:29.320 --> 41:32.120
But you're doing your part
to find an answer.

41:32.280 --> 41:34.480
And God knows we need answers right now.

41:37.160 --> 41:38.160
Hey.

41:42.040 --> 41:43.480
And I will be here,

41:43.640 --> 41:46.240
waiting for you, when you get back.

41:51.400 --> 41:54.200
I made a list of the people
I deal with at the bank.

41:55.160 --> 41:57.720
My lawyer has a copy of my will.

41:59.880 --> 42:01.360
Okay.

42:03.240 --> 42:05.560
She set up a trust for the children.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.400
You're an executor alongside her.

42:10.800 --> 42:12.320
Okay, fine, yeah.

42:13.120 --> 42:15.880
I wrote down the name
and number of their doctor,

42:16.040 --> 42:19.160
she has a list
of all their immunizations.

42:20.200 --> 42:22.720
And the names of their teachers.

42:25.680 --> 42:27.000
And...

42:28.520 --> 42:32.760
I promised Isabelle we would
take a trip for her birthday,

42:32.920 --> 42:34.920
if she improved her grades...

42:35.840 --> 42:38.640
-Why don't we do this later?
-No, we need to do this now.

42:38.800 --> 42:39.960
Why?

42:40.920 --> 42:42.880
Because I can't leave without knowing

42:43.040 --> 42:46.520
that if something happens,
they'll be taken care of.

42:46.680 --> 42:48.840
-You don't have to go.
-I do.

42:49.080 --> 42:51.840
No, stay. We're safe here.

42:55.520 --> 42:58.080
If we are right,
if there is something out there,

42:58.240 --> 43:00.440
and we don't figure out
a way to get it to stop,

43:00.600 --> 43:02.960
nowhere will be safe, for anyone.

43:08.240 --> 43:09.960
I hardly know them.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.280
I don't know what they like,
what they don't like.

43:14.440 --> 43:16.160
Who their friends are,

43:16.320 --> 43:18.880
what they do
when they're alone. I mean...

43:19.120 --> 43:20.440
We never talk,

43:20.600 --> 43:24.440
all we do is dance around each other,
afraid to say the wrong thing.

43:24.600 --> 43:27.480
They're still getting to know
themselves at this age.

43:28.280 --> 43:29.720
You'll catch up.

43:30.640 --> 43:32.160
You know that.

43:33.720 --> 43:34.840
I know.

43:39.800 --> 43:41.440
What time do you need to leave?

43:44.840 --> 43:46.520
First thing in the morning.

43:48.280 --> 43:50.400
-I leave these with me.
-Okay.

43:51.280 --> 43:52.760
Thank you.

43:53.560 --> 43:55.840
Well, I think we'd better play
that game.

43:58.240 --> 43:59.240
Okay.

44:03.400 --> 44:05.440
-Who has first go?
-I do.

44:06.360 --> 44:08.640
-I did double five.
-Okay.

44:08.800 --> 44:10.600
I have first go, I always have first go.

44:10.760 --> 44:12.360
No, you're last.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.520
Sigur, it's me.

44:18.960 --> 44:21.000
I just wanted you to know...

44:22.600 --> 44:25.280
I can't imagine a life
without you either.

44:30.320 --> 44:32.880
Sigur, it's me.

44:35.160 --> 44:37.160
I just wanted you to know...

44:38.800 --> 44:41.520
I can't imagine a life
without you either.

Captain, this just came in.

45:35.080 --> 45:37.960
Turn her on three-one-zero.
We're having guests.
