09:47.294 --> 09:48.716
That's a tough question, bud.

09:51.256 --> 09:54.351
Your mom decided to go stay
with Grandma on her own.

09:57.013 --> 09:58.514
She can come home
whenever she wants.

09:58.807 --> 10:00.774
But she says you
don't want her to.

10:03.852 --> 10:05.821
Well, I think what
she meant was, um...

10:08.024 --> 10:10.618
That we both have
things to figure out.

10:12.236 --> 10:13.533
Is it because of Tim?

10:14.780 --> 10:15.998
No, it's not because of that.

11:23.474 --> 11:24.520

11:24.600 --> 11:25.726

to be scared of, yeah?

they come out this far?

17:03.773 --> 17:04.819

19:00.556 --> 19:01.978

This thing's got
people spooked, and...

Paul: Yeah.

19:16.905 --> 19:18.374

19:23.828 --> 19:25.705

that far on its hind legs.

19:32.755 --> 19:34.007
Guy laughed at me.

19:35.090 --> 19:36.683
You know, the people
are getting panicky.

19:37.926 --> 19:39.679
I don't know how long we
can keep spinning this.

19:41.262 --> 19:44.642
Yeah, whoever did this

19:46.227 --> 19:47.604
You still think it's a person?

19:47.686 --> 19:50.109
I mean, those tracks, they
disappeared into thin air.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.407
How is a person gonna
make three miles of tracks

19:52.482 --> 19:53.951

19:54.026 --> 19:55.242
Donny: Doesn't make any sense.

19:55.403 --> 19:57.872

get to you, Donny.

19:59.073 --> 20:01.246

whoever did this wants.

20:04.619 --> 20:07.294
Hopefully this just
all blows over.

20:07.957 --> 20:09.209
Yeah.

20:11.085 --> 20:12.961

Quite a little mystery we
seem to have woken up to.

20:28.810 --> 20:31.154
Well, nothing mysterious
about a good prank.

20:32.480 --> 20:33.698
Can I do something for you?

20:33.773 --> 20:35.651
Oh, Jonah, my black
lab ran off last night.

20:36.109 --> 20:38.157
And it seems I'm not the
only one missing a pet.

20:39.822 --> 20:41.414
I'll do what I
can to find him.

20:41.490 --> 20:42.787
Priest: I really
appreciate it.

20:43.075 --> 20:45.076
- Paul: 'Kay.
- Priest: Very odd, animals

20:45.161 --> 20:48.131
acting up the same night as
this little incident, yes?

20:48.663 --> 20:50.211
Yes. Yes, it is.

20:50.290 --> 20:52.759
Seen a fair amount of
Susan in church, lately.

20:53.544 --> 20:55.090
I haven't seen you in some time.

20:56.212 --> 20:58.635
Priest: There is no weakness
in mourning, Paul.

20:59.174 --> 21:00.346
Accidents happen.

21:01.009 --> 21:02.432
Turning to something
outside ourselves,

21:02.510 --> 21:03.728
every once in awhile?

21:04.180 --> 21:05.432
That just shows wisdom

21:05.513 --> 21:07.266
in knowing where
to find strength.

21:07.348 --> 21:09.271
The church and I are
here when you need us.

21:09.977 --> 21:10.943
Thank you, Father.

21:11.019 --> 21:12.192
Priest: Oh, and, uh...

21:12.771 --> 21:15.194
People may seem a little
nervous, right now.

21:15.648 --> 21:18.242
But they'll follow you
to the ends of the earth.

21:18.652 --> 21:19.699
Just let them know
you're leading them

21:19.778 --> 21:20.951
in the right direction.

21:22.405 --> 21:23.406
Thanks.

21:26.242 --> 21:30.713
(phone rings in the distance)

21:43.384 --> 21:44.886
(phone rings in the distance)

22:18.211 --> 22:19.304
ls everyone all right?

22:21.131 --> 22:22.428
What's going on, Sheriff?

22:25.094 --> 22:26.391
I'm trying to figure that out.

22:26.470 --> 22:28.518
My dad's got some pretty
crazy ideas about it.

22:28.972 --> 22:30.974
Yeah, for once that old
nut bag might be right.

22:32.559 --> 22:34.186
I bet it's got
something to do with

22:34.269 --> 22:36.522
those stories my
grandpa used to tell me.

22:37.730 --> 22:40.779
About something
living in those woods.

22:40.859 --> 22:42.076
It doesn't.

22:42.778 --> 22:44.451
Well, what are we
supposed to do about it?

22:45.239 --> 22:48.163
You don't have to do
anything, all right, we're...

22:48.241 --> 22:49.288
We're working on it.

22:50.243 --> 22:51.496
Jim: Oh, is that right?

22:52.788 --> 22:55.165
Then tell me, why aren't
you out there right now

22:55.249 --> 22:56.546
hunting that thing down?

22:56.625 --> 22:59.423
'Cause it pays to think
before you act, Jim.

23:01.380 --> 23:02.847
Claire: Well, what
if it comes back?

23:05.718 --> 23:08.096
There is no "it", okay?

23:09.805 --> 23:12.182
There is no "it".

23:15.059 --> 23:17.608
Forest Department
said this morning

23:17.688 --> 23:19.405
that there's no animal
that leaves tracks

23:19.480 --> 23:20.573
like the ones that we found.

23:20.648 --> 23:21.901
Okay, so that
tells me that we're

23:21.983 --> 23:24.281
dealing with a
creative prankster

23:24.361 --> 23:26.409
who's heard all the
great ghost stories

23:26.488 --> 23:28.865
that our buddy Jim,
here, has heard.

23:29.657 --> 23:31.079
Well, maybe it's that
new deputy of yours.

23:31.660 --> 23:32.661
Hm?

23:32.912 --> 23:34.913
Jim: City guy,
thinkin' it's funny

23:34.997 --> 23:36.999
to stir things up?

23:37.082 --> 23:38.128
That's enough.

23:48.844 --> 23:49.891
Sheriff!

23:53.641 --> 23:54.688
How's it going, Sheriff?

23:55.726 --> 23:57.773
Oh, she's going, Earl. You?

23:58.519 --> 23:59.692
Good.

24:01.190 --> 24:02.406
You been out in
the woods, lately?

24:02.691 --> 24:03.738
Into the trees?

24:04.609 --> 24:05.781
Yeah.

24:06.569 --> 24:08.367
Donny and I went pretty
deep this morning.

24:09.239 --> 24:10.365
It's deer season.

24:11.532 --> 24:12.875
But in the last
week I haven't seen

24:12.951 --> 24:14.828
so much as one deer within
five miles of this town.

24:15.788 --> 24:16.960
Never seen nothing like it.

24:17.038 --> 24:19.166
All the animals just
up and vanished.

24:19.249 --> 24:20.717
Huh.

24:21.542 --> 24:23.465
What do you think would
cause something like that?

24:24.212 --> 24:25.259
It's hard to say.

24:26.882 --> 24:27.929
But...

24:28.217 --> 24:29.469
an animal senses a threat,

24:29.969 --> 24:31.221
they tend not to hang around.

24:32.304 --> 24:33.646
A threat.

24:34.515 --> 24:37.644
So you think an
animal left those tracks?

24:38.434 --> 24:40.938
They don't look like any
animal tracks I've ever seen.

24:45.150 --> 24:46.402
You take it easy, now, Sheriff.

24:47.403 --> 24:49.905
Remember, we're all
still prayin' for ya.

24:51.406 --> 24:52.407
Thanks.

25:05.295 --> 25:06.762
- Susan: Hey.
- Paul: Hey.

25:06.838 --> 25:07.885
Susan: Thanks for
taking him, tonight,

25:07.964 --> 25:10.012
I forgot I volunteered
at the church.

25:10.092 --> 25:11.093
No problem.

25:12.219 --> 25:14.313
I took him to the park today.

25:15.722 --> 25:18.852
The kids there were
saying it's the devil,

25:18.933 --> 25:20.355
all this stuff going on.

25:21.144 --> 25:22.192
Did it scare him?

25:22.604 --> 25:23.651
Yeah.

25:27.233 --> 25:28.451
It's been six months, Paul.

25:31.070 --> 25:33.289
I need to know where you are.

25:34.490 --> 25:35.913
Susan: Because it's not fair.

25:37.286 --> 25:39.788
It's not fair to us, and
it's not fair to Adam.

25:45.501 --> 25:46.594
Where are you?

25:52.217 --> 25:53.433
I don't know.

25:58.682 --> 26:00.183
I'll get him, it'll
be just a minute.

26:04.395 --> 26:09.152
-(low hum)
-(car tires crunch on dirt)

26:26.210 --> 26:27.301
Adam: Stop!

26:27.419 --> 26:28.385
What?

26:28.461 --> 26:29.554
There's something out there.

26:29.671 --> 26:30.843
Enough.

26:32.965 --> 26:34.262
Last night was one
thing, buddy, but--

26:34.343 --> 26:36.766
Dad, look! Look!

26:37.346 --> 26:38.438
Adam: Did you see it?

26:43.684 --> 26:44.731
You stay here.

26:46.480 --> 26:47.527
Lock the doors.

26:54.488 --> 26:55.704
(doors lock)

27:03.538 --> 27:04.539
(branches rustle)

27:07.209 --> 27:08.631
Hey...

27:08.710 --> 27:13.056
♪ (dramatic music) ♪

27:18.929 --> 27:20.977
(wood creaks)

27:35.237 --> 27:37.990
Come out, now, before you get
yourself into more trouble!

27:41.160 --> 27:43.162
(metal jingles)

27:53.087 --> 27:55.432
(metal tags jingle)

28:10.146 --> 28:11.147
Paul: Adam...

28:11.815 --> 28:12.862
Adam!

28:17.528 --> 28:18.529
Adam!

28:20.531 --> 28:22.454
(breathes shakily)
Adam!

28:28.164 --> 28:29.211
Adam!

28:31.375 --> 28:32.423
Adam!

28:34.796 --> 28:35.843
Adam: Dad?

28:42.136 --> 28:43.605
Are you hurt?

28:43.763 --> 28:46.438
I heard something outside
the car and I got scared.

28:48.352 --> 28:50.104
I'm never gonna let
anything happen to you.

28:51.646 --> 28:52.739
Do you understand that?

29:00.321 --> 29:01.664
(sighs)

29:07.287 --> 29:08.663
- Earl: Here you go.
- Bar Patron: Thanks, Earl.

29:13.251 --> 29:14.252
You drinking to remember,

29:14.336 --> 29:15.553
or are you drinking to forget?

29:16.630 --> 29:18.723
I'll take another
and see where it leads.

29:19.674 --> 29:20.926
How's it going
with Sheriff Sheilds?

29:21.175 --> 29:22.222
He's a good man.

29:24.512 --> 29:25.559
Yeah.

29:28.892 --> 29:29.939
So how you likin' it?

29:30.685 --> 29:32.278
The town, not my booze,

29:32.354 --> 29:33.570
I know my booze is good.

29:34.480 --> 29:35.606
It's different.

29:37.358 --> 29:39.236
- Good kinda different.
- Hmm.

29:40.028 --> 29:42.155
Lot of excitement,
tracks in the snow.

29:43.406 --> 29:44.624
Hmm.

29:45.032 --> 29:46.579
How much you know
about this place?

29:46.660 --> 29:47.876
And them woods?

29:50.163 --> 29:54.259
Yeah, my grandma, she
was full blood Shawnee.

29:54.875 --> 29:56.219
Used to tell stories passed down

29:56.295 --> 29:58.548
by our people for generations.

29:59.381 --> 30:01.679
Oh, yeah? Stories?

30:01.758 --> 30:03.977
Mmhmm, about them woods.

30:04.051 --> 30:05.269
And what lived out there.

30:06.262 --> 30:08.766
The spirits that
roamed in the trees.

30:09.724 --> 30:12.604
See they, they say when
the white man came here,

30:12.685 --> 30:15.734
he didn't respect the land,
or the spirits.

30:16.315 --> 30:17.362
So they came after 'em.

30:18.858 --> 30:20.906
Men, women, the children.

30:23.696 --> 30:24.743
Do you, uh...

30:25.906 --> 30:27.453
Do you believe the stories?

30:27.951 --> 30:29.327
Well, when I was young,

30:29.744 --> 30:31.792
there was a boy went
missing up in them woods.

30:33.039 --> 30:34.416
They searched.

30:34.624 --> 30:37.923
When they found him, his
body was 30 feet up a tree.

30:38.836 --> 30:40.180
So let's just say,

30:40.922 --> 30:43.141
I believe it enough to
keep my door locked.

30:44.300 --> 30:45.552
You be careful, now, Deputy.

30:45.634 --> 30:46.978
Wouldn't wanna
find you up a tree.

30:51.474 --> 30:52.442
Claire: Hey, Earl.

30:52.517 --> 30:53.769
Earl: Hello, ladies.

30:58.105 --> 30:59.153
What'll it be?

30:59.691 --> 31:04.116
(Claire gives order quietly)

31:36.144 --> 31:38.271
I'm a little confused
as to why we're here.

31:38.814 --> 31:40.907
When children
pick up a new word,

31:40.981 --> 31:42.700
they tend to say it constantly.

31:43.484 --> 31:44.701
It only gets worse
when they learn

31:44.778 --> 31:47.701
we don't want them
to say that word.

31:47.780 --> 31:49.249
Did Adam say
something offensive?

32:06.383 --> 32:08.009
Mr. and Mrs. Shields...

32:09.344 --> 32:10.596
Pecker?
(laughs)

32:10.679 --> 32:13.102
- Paul: We're sorry.
- Susan: Sorry.

32:13.181 --> 32:16.684
About a week ago Adam
called another child a pecker,

32:17.184 --> 32:20.609
and since then all the
children have been saying it.

32:20.689 --> 32:24.910
- We can't get them to stop.
-(Susan and Paul laugh)

32:24.984 --> 32:27.703
But as I can see,
apparently, some people don't

32:27.778 --> 32:29.951
view this as quite the
serious matter that it is.

32:30.030 --> 32:31.532
We do, we do, I...

32:32.491 --> 32:33.993
We're sorry, we'll talk to him.

32:34.076 --> 32:35.294
It won't happen again.

32:36.413 --> 32:37.710
There is one other thing.

32:39.082 --> 32:40.128
What's that?

32:41.041 --> 32:42.463
When he refers to Tim,

32:42.544 --> 32:44.717
he always seems to
use the present tense.

32:45.212 --> 32:46.964
Teacher: "Tim is, Tim can."

32:47.048 --> 32:48.391
ls there something
wrong with that?

32:49.509 --> 32:51.056
Teacher: Referring to
someone who is deceased

32:51.135 --> 32:54.856
in such a way just
seems unhealthy.

32:54.931 --> 32:56.523
I don't see how
that's a problem.

32:57.308 --> 33:00.778
More times than not,
when parents separate

33:00.854 --> 33:01.901
it's the children that get--

33:01.980 --> 33:03.402
Tim is his brother.

33:04.941 --> 33:06.659
My child can refer
to his brother

33:06.734 --> 33:08.237
however the hell he chooses.

33:08.319 --> 33:09.663
Teacher: I beg your pard--

33:09.738 --> 33:10.990
Susan: And you are not gonna
tell us how to raise our son.

33:11.071 --> 33:12.073
Do you understand me?

33:12.156 --> 33:13.078
Mrs. Shields, I--

33:13.157 --> 33:14.579
Do you understand me?

33:28.757 --> 33:31.226
(sobs)

34:30.652 --> 34:31.652
Donny: Hey.

34:33.027 --> 34:34.076
I called you, before.

34:35.574 --> 34:36.541
Is everything all right?

34:36.614 --> 34:37.538
Yeah.

34:37.617 --> 34:39.244
I was just calling to check in.

34:47.376 --> 34:48.344
I was...

34:48.420 --> 34:49.967
It's none of my business.

34:53.007 --> 34:58.014
-(rumble)
-(birds tweeting agitatedly)

34:58.429 --> 34:59.431
You hear that?

35:01.932 --> 35:06.358
(rumble grows)

35:19.199 --> 35:20.291
What the hell is going on?

35:21.661 --> 35:24.710
(wings flap rapidly)

35:32.755 --> 35:33.927
Thank you.

35:42.681 --> 35:44.355
I've never seen
anything like that.

35:47.061 --> 35:48.153
Earl Everheart...

35:49.731 --> 35:51.199
He came up to me the other day.

35:53.193 --> 35:55.161
He said all the wildlife's gone.

35:56.278 --> 35:57.576
Paul: Those birds were leaving.

35:58.572 --> 36:00.291
It's closer to spring
than fall, they...

36:00.909 --> 36:02.411
They're supposed
to be flying north.

36:03.577 --> 36:04.750
And they were going south.

36:05.621 --> 36:06.713
Did he mention
any of his theories

36:06.789 --> 36:08.666
about what he thinks
might be going on?

36:10.376 --> 36:11.719
I was at his bar last night,

36:11.795 --> 36:13.012
he had some pretty crazy ideas.

36:13.088 --> 36:14.931
Those are just stories, Donny.

36:16.382 --> 36:17.509
Paul: And people have
been telling them

36:17.592 --> 36:19.514
around here for a long time.

36:20.219 --> 36:21.766
Earl was just
having fun with you.

36:23.806 --> 36:25.275
But what if they're not?

36:25.809 --> 36:27.777
Donny: What if there's something
wrong about these woods?

36:29.144 --> 36:32.068
He said something about
his Indian ancestors,

36:32.148 --> 36:33.195
they knew about a creature--

36:33.273 --> 36:35.275
He's about as
Indian as you or I.

36:37.237 --> 36:39.534
You really think there's a
monster in the woods, Donny?

36:41.240 --> 36:42.208
No.

36:42.282 --> 36:43.284
Okay.

36:46.579 --> 36:47.579
But...

36:48.164 --> 36:49.255
These stories, they just sounded

36:49.331 --> 36:50.800
a lot like what's been going on.

36:51.501 --> 36:52.797
Donny: I don't know.

36:54.503 --> 36:56.632
And then he mentioned
something about a boy.

36:56.715 --> 36:58.432
-(Paul sighs)
- Donny: He was out in the woods

36:58.507 --> 37:02.137
a few years ago,
and then he went missing.

37:02.219 --> 37:03.563
They couldn't find
him until they--

37:03.637 --> 37:05.481
They found a body
up in the tree.

37:06.181 --> 37:07.273
Right.

37:09.393 --> 37:10.815
That boy was murdered, Donny.

37:11.146 --> 37:12.568
No monsters needed.

37:19.403 --> 37:23.500
Bad things happen,
'cause people let them happen.

37:31.541 --> 37:33.668
<i>Paul: Somebody's always
responsible, Donny.</i>

37:34.835 --> 37:35.836
(tag jingles)

37:58.735 --> 38:00.202
Susan: Thank you so much, Donny.

38:01.320 --> 38:02.413
Yeah, my pleasure.

38:03.447 --> 38:04.869
Actually, my dad was a mechanic.

38:05.657 --> 38:07.376
I always thought I was
gonna end up being one.

38:07.869 --> 38:08.960
Why didn't you?

38:09.913 --> 38:11.835
After my mom left us, uh...

38:13.458 --> 38:15.085
I spent so much time
in the police station

38:15.168 --> 38:16.385
bailing my dad out.

38:18.003 --> 38:20.722
Just, uh, figured I may
as well become a cop.

38:26.304 --> 38:27.304
Has he told you?

38:29.474 --> 38:30.896
About Tim?

38:34.394 --> 38:36.193
<i>Susan: I had taken Adam
to a friend's,</i>

38:36.271 --> 38:38.445

38:38.983 --> 38:40.905
<i>We had one of
those kiddy pools.</i>

38:43.112 --> 38:46.536
They think he slipped and
hit his head on the bottom.

38:50.911 --> 38:52.083
I'm sorry.

38:53.414 --> 38:55.257
<i>Susan: I don't blame him,
you know.</i>

38:55.333 --> 38:56.755
<i>It was an accident.</i>

38:57.835 --> 39:00.213
<i>It wasn't his fault,
it could've so easily been me.</i>

39:02.297 --> 39:04.221
<i>The problem is,
he blames himself.</i>

39:05.717 --> 39:08.847
He doesn't think he deserves
what he has, but he does.

39:12.559 --> 39:13.775
It's hard to make somebody see

39:13.851 --> 39:15.525

you see in them.

But for the life of me, I

40:30.344 --> 40:31.346
Till last night.

40:31.846 --> 40:33.018
What happened last night?

ain't got any shoes.

43:17.469 --> 43:18.686

43:20.681 --> 43:22.523
the two cloven
halves are the same,

43:22.599 --> 43:23.646

43:24.226 --> 43:25.695
This ridge ain't normal.

43:26.103 --> 43:29.027
It's like the hoof is divided

43:34.987 --> 43:37.331
A hoof divided
into three parts.

43:38.782 --> 43:40.000

Who knows?

51:07.690 --> 51:08.657
Other deer were gone,

that one wasn't.

51:10.275 --> 51:12.824

51:14.153 --> 51:15.246
Maybe it couldn't keep up,

51:15.322 --> 51:16.824
maybe all the other
ones left it behind,

51:17.074 --> 51:18.246
I'm not really sure.

51:18.324 --> 51:19.621
Hey, you're losing me, boss.

51:20.159 --> 51:21.628
Ron Jenkins' missing horse.

51:22.788 --> 51:24.710
We thought Ron
left the gate open.

51:24.789 --> 51:25.882

think that's right.

51:33.172 --> 51:34.344
The claw marks.

51:41.889 --> 51:44.018
First I thought it
was coincidence,

51:44.101 --> 51:46.068
or part of a
well-thought-out prank.

51:46.519 --> 51:49.239
Deep cuts on the
tree in the forest.

51:49.315 --> 51:52.443
I mean, it meant nothing
to me at the time.

51:52.943 --> 51:55.661
Just now, that dead
deer on the road...

51:58.032 --> 52:00.329
It had four razor sharp
cuts right through its body.

52:01.242 --> 52:02.244
Same ones?

52:02.327 --> 52:03.375
Same size.

52:04.579 --> 52:05.922
Those stories you heard...

52:06.789 --> 52:09.043
I'm not saying that they're
all accurate, but...

52:11.295 --> 52:13.137
I think we might be dealing
with something that's

52:14.088 --> 52:15.715
not easily explained.

52:16.382 --> 52:19.603
A few years ago I saw on TV,
they caught this giant fish

52:19.677 --> 52:21.931
off the coast of
Taiwan or somewhere.

52:22.472 --> 52:24.146
They thought that this
thing had been extinct

52:24.224 --> 52:25.771
for like, millions of years.

52:26.226 --> 52:27.523
Then, barn, there it is.

52:27.603 --> 52:29.355
Right under our
noses the whole time.

52:29.688 --> 52:30.985
Swimming around in the ocean.

52:31.898 --> 52:33.242
So what I'm saying is, maybe...

52:34.943 --> 52:36.740
Maybe this thing that
we're looking for,

52:37.780 --> 52:39.157
maybe it's always been here.

52:40.907 --> 52:42.284
And we're just now noticing it.

52:43.911 --> 52:45.003
So why now?

Oh.

deputy in here enough to

53:11.605 --> 53:12.822

- No.

53:21.407 --> 53:22.623
I can't figure out why.

53:23.826 --> 53:25.623
Man can't even protect
his own family.

53:26.954 --> 53:28.045
Now, can I hit him?

53:31.375 --> 53:32.592
I'm still deciding.

53:38.132 --> 53:39.304
Jim: You boys
have a good evening.

53:41.009 --> 53:42.226
We got the utmost faith in ya.

53:43.094 --> 53:44.141
(Jim laughs)

53:51.478 --> 53:52.570
Jim: Go get me a beer, dude!

53:52.646 --> 53:53.737
Paul: Let's go.

54:23.177 --> 54:24.429
(branches rustle violently)

54:29.766 --> 54:30.858
I think it was a bear.

54:31.184 --> 54:32.186
That fast?

54:32.268 --> 54:33.269
Shh.

54:34.521 --> 54:36.773
(creature snarls)

54:44.280 --> 54:48.161
(branches rustle)

54:50.661 --> 54:52.585
(creature snarls)

54:54.833 --> 54:56.335
-(gunshot bangs)
-(man yells)

55:17.523 --> 55:19.525
You know, it's kinda
funny you never asked me.

55:21.735 --> 55:23.702
What you shoulda asked
me in our interview.

55:24.612 --> 55:25.909
You know, why a
guy from New York

55:25.989 --> 55:28.083
would come out here to
basically the middle of nowhere.

55:29.117 --> 55:30.208
You got shot, Donny.

55:32.579 --> 55:33.795
Paul: That's reason enough
for me.

55:35.289 --> 55:37.291
I know what it's like, to uh...

55:38.251 --> 55:40.721
Have people always telling
you that it wasn't your fault.

55:44.675 --> 55:45.927
I don't need to
know anything else.

55:56.644 --> 55:57.771
Donny: Do you ever pray?

55:59.898 --> 56:01.615
I mean, I never used to pray.

56:02.483 --> 56:03.530
But...

56:05.152 --> 56:06.369
When I was on that gurney,

56:08.072 --> 56:09.699
and they told me that
my father died...

56:11.451 --> 56:12.827
You know, things had been
going so well for me.

56:13.619 --> 56:14.963
I was moving up in the force,

56:16.081 --> 56:17.297
I had a nice girl.

56:21.460 --> 56:23.679
Ever since then,
I've been asking God why.

56:27.300 --> 56:30.054
But, uh, now I think
maybe I know why.

56:34.141 --> 56:35.813
Maybe I wasn't where
I was supposed to be.

56:38.644 --> 56:40.989
(Paul sighs)

56:43.190 --> 56:44.943
Is this where you're
supposed to be, Donny?

56:46.820 --> 56:48.947
Paul: Is this where God
told you to be?

56:51.992 --> 56:53.164
We all have a purpose.

56:53.659 --> 56:55.081
Ours is to protect people.

56:57.164 --> 56:59.291
Maybe there's somebody here
I'm supposed to protect.

57:01.208 --> 57:02.380
There you go.

57:10.885 --> 57:12.684
Or maybe you're
supposed to protect me.

57:26.860 --> 57:31.161
(engine shuts off)

57:54.637 --> 57:55.639
(twig snaps)

58:09.402 --> 58:10.619
(branches rustle)

58:19.413 --> 58:21.255
(eerie clicking)

58:23.375 --> 58:24.842
(child's muffled
laughter echoes)

58:37.264 --> 58:38.356
Tim?

58:42.561 --> 58:44.528
Please! It's after me.

58:44.603 --> 58:46.447
It's in the woods, behind me.

58:46.773 --> 58:47.695
Please!

58:47.773 --> 58:50.447
(man pants for breath)

58:56.324 --> 58:57.871
We'd been hunting
for a few hours.

58:59.369 --> 59:00.369
Hunter: Hadn't seen anything.

59:01.288 --> 59:02.664
And then we came upon something.

59:03.789 --> 59:06.463
And we started tracking it.

59:06.918 --> 59:08.545
It had to be a deer.

59:08.628 --> 59:12.382
We thought somehow it just
wandered right past us.

59:12.715 --> 59:13.762
Then what happened?

59:15.052 --> 59:18.101
It was fast, so fast.

59:18.889 --> 59:20.106
Hunter: It got Manny, first.

59:22.016 --> 59:25.146
Then Ryan,
he was screaming in pain.

59:26.438 --> 59:27.438
Did you see it?

59:29.483 --> 59:30.780
I don't know what I saw.

59:36.072 --> 59:37.324
We'll start searching for 'em.

59:38.282 --> 59:39.329
Hunter: Don't bother.

59:40.494 --> 59:41.836
They're already dead.

59:43.329 --> 59:46.083
<i>Paul: Assuming that there
is some sort of animal</i>

59:46.166 --> 59:48.510
in these woods that's
never been discovered,

59:50.170 --> 59:51.467
how could that be possible?

59:52.505 --> 59:55.304
How could it go
unnoticed for so long?

59:57.719 --> 59:58.811
Donny: I don't know.

01:00:00.179 --> 01:00:01.476
What if it's like

01:00:02.766 --> 01:00:05.815
your prehistoric fish
that we talked about?

01:00:08.313 --> 01:00:09.940
Maybe it's adapted
to its environment.

01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:16.204
Maybe it's learned how to hide.

01:00:19.449 --> 01:00:21.918
What if it's smart enough
to know that we're a threat?

01:00:23.452 --> 01:00:24.704
Huh?

01:00:25.204 --> 01:00:27.958
To know to avoid us,
till it has no choice.

01:00:30.043 --> 01:00:31.840
That'd be a very
dangerous animal.

01:00:35.132 --> 01:00:37.476
(cell phone rings)

01:00:48.436 --> 01:00:50.733
-(engine dies)
- Earl: 'Bout time.

01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:54.242
It's this way, fellas.

01:00:54.317 --> 01:00:59.039
(leaves rustle)

01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:14.387
Donny: Oh, no.

01:01:14.461 --> 01:01:15.463
How the...

01:01:15.547 --> 01:01:16.672
Earl: Yeah.

01:01:16.755 --> 01:01:17.927
No animal I know of
kills like that.

01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:27.440
Any tracks?

01:01:28.059 --> 01:01:29.275
No.

01:01:29.476 --> 01:01:30.853
It's too cold,
the ground's too hard.

01:01:37.235 --> 01:01:38.862
You boys get outta
these woods right now.

01:01:38.945 --> 01:01:40.367
What? Why?

01:01:40.447 --> 01:01:42.289
Come on, Paul, it's the last
two weeks of huntin' season.

01:01:42.364 --> 01:01:45.460
Whatever did this is
still in those trees.

01:01:45.784 --> 01:01:46.956
Yeah, that's
exactly why I wanna--

01:01:47.036 --> 01:01:48.630
We're gonna handle this, Jim.

01:01:49.414 --> 01:01:50.757
Paul: You understand?

01:01:51.875 --> 01:01:53.717
No one from town's
allowed into these woods.

01:01:55.545 --> 01:01:58.219
We make sure everyone is in
their house before nightfall.

01:01:58.297 --> 01:01:59.298
Okay, Sheriff.

01:02:01.635 --> 01:02:02.681
You got that, Jim?

01:02:05.804 --> 01:02:07.181
<i>Paul: I understand
what you're saying.</i>

01:02:07.264 --> 01:02:09.983
No, I do, but what
I'm telling you

01:02:10.059 --> 01:02:11.231
is that people have been

01:02:11.311 --> 01:02:13.233
attacked and killed
in our woods.

01:02:14.481 --> 01:02:16.733
<i>Paul: Two dozen men armed
enough to get a handle</i>

01:02:16.815 --> 01:02:18.909
on this in 24 hours,
that's what you're saying?

01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:21.911
I have your word?

01:02:23.989 --> 01:02:26.960
- Yeah. Yeah, you too.
-(phone beeps)

01:02:29.411 --> 01:02:30.503
Donny: The coroner's gonna have

01:02:30.579 --> 01:02:31.922
a hell of a time getting
those bodies down.

01:02:32.748 --> 01:02:33.715
Yeah.

01:02:33.791 --> 01:02:34.793
What'd the Rangers say?

01:02:36.168 --> 01:02:37.512
24 hours.

01:02:37.963 --> 01:02:40.010
Paul: At least most people
left 'cause of the storm.

01:02:40.090 --> 01:02:41.512
We'll be fine in town.

01:02:43.425 --> 01:02:44.472
We'll make do.

01:02:46.346 --> 01:02:47.347
Yeah.

01:02:53.143 --> 01:02:54.521
<i>Radio: With no
sign of letting up,</i>

01:02:54.603 --> 01:02:57.402
<i>the storm system continues

01:03:31.724 --> 01:03:33.146
Hey, it's me.

01:03:33.601 --> 01:03:37.731
Um, I just wanted to thank
you for taking Adam tonight.

01:03:39.315 --> 01:03:40.659
<i>Susan". (phone) He was scared
with the storm,</i>

01:03:40.733 --> 01:03:42.702

<i>I love you.</i>

01:03:54.164 --> 01:03:55.255
(knocking)

01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:58.376
Donny: Hey,
finished my rounds.

01:03:58.460 --> 01:03:59.836
Most of the town evacuated.

01:03:59.918 --> 01:04:01.545
- Paul: Good.
- Donny: What's going on?

01:04:01.628 --> 01:04:03.097
Paul: I'm gonna
show you something.

01:04:04.257 --> 01:04:06.351
I put a call into the
Sheriff up in Tanner,

01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:08.728
when I heard the news said
the wildlife migration

01:04:08.802 --> 01:04:09.804
affected them, as well.

01:04:11.264 --> 01:04:12.311
Paul: He sent me this.

01:04:13.724 --> 01:04:15.068
Two weeks ago, a crew of loggers

01:04:15.143 --> 01:04:17.065
went missing just
outside of Tanner.

01:04:17.936 --> 01:04:19.108
I think that the logging

01:04:19.688 --> 01:04:22.192
it forced the animal
south towards us.

01:04:22.275 --> 01:04:23.367
All these years,
it's been able to live

01:04:23.443 --> 01:04:25.445
in these remote
parts of the forest.

01:04:26.945 --> 01:04:30.416
There's a police report for
two missing cattle in Tanner.

01:04:30.492 --> 01:04:32.710
And then two days later,
yours truly.

01:04:32.786 --> 01:04:34.333
-(bridle tag jingles)
- Number 88.

01:04:34.411 --> 01:04:35.880
Ron Jenkins' missing horse.

01:04:36.164 --> 01:04:39.713
So the foresting, it just
flushed it out right towards us.

01:04:39.793 --> 01:04:40.918
And there's...

01:04:41.668 --> 01:04:43.295
There's no more
forest to the south.

01:04:43.963 --> 01:04:45.965
- So it's trapped.
- Paul: It's threatened.

01:04:46.715 --> 01:04:48.559
I think it's fighting
for territory.

01:04:52.304 --> 01:04:53.396
Sit down.

01:04:54.099 --> 01:04:55.021
(knocking at door)

01:04:55.099 --> 01:04:56.226
Get caught up on this stuff.

01:04:56.309 --> 01:04:57.525
(knocking at door)

01:04:57.601 --> 01:04:58.818
Yeah.

01:05:05.652 --> 01:05:09.452
I keep a camera
out in the woods,

01:05:09.947 --> 01:05:13.168
so I can keep track of
the larger bucks at night.

01:05:14.119 --> 01:05:15.961
It has an infrared sensor.

01:05:16.871 --> 01:05:18.668
Records any movement
when it's triggered.

01:05:23.378 --> 01:05:24.594
What are we looking for, Jim?

01:05:25.588 --> 01:05:26.760
You'll know it
when you see it.

01:05:48.695 --> 01:05:49.820
Whoa.

01:05:53.949 --> 01:05:54.996
That was it.

01:05:55.492 --> 01:05:56.744
It coulda been a deer.

01:05:57.454 --> 01:05:58.501
Yeah, that's what I figured.

01:06:00.498 --> 01:06:01.795
Till I looked at the footage.

01:06:03.041 --> 01:06:05.090
I looked closer,
and caught this.

01:06:17.806 --> 01:06:18.807
Jim: I'll leave these with you.

01:06:20.768 --> 01:06:21.940
Okay.

01:06:25.063 --> 01:06:26.190
Yeah, I'm gonna
head out too, boss.

01:06:29.568 --> 01:06:31.536
You notice the cell
service is down?

01:06:32.405 --> 01:06:34.282
Always happens during a storm.

01:06:37.159 --> 01:06:38.833
All right, I'll see you
in the morning, boss.

01:06:44.458 --> 01:06:48.713
(storm winds blow)

01:07:00.807 --> 01:07:02.275

01:07:26.416 --> 01:07:27.418
What was that?

01:07:27.501 --> 01:07:28.719
Paul: Get in the bathroom, now.

01:07:30.213 --> 01:07:31.179
Get up, come on.

01:07:31.255 --> 01:07:33.724

-(glass shatters)
-(creature growls)

01:07:42.516 --> 01:07:44.769
Get into the tub. Get low.

Donny?

01:08:04.914 --> 01:08:06.130
Hey, boss, you say something?

-(creature growls)
-(items clatter)

01:08:10.628 --> 01:08:12.800
I think there's interference
from the storm, or something.

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:14.222
Donny, it's in the house.

(creature roars)

01:09:36.506 --> 01:09:37.506
Stay here.

01:09:39.676 --> 01:09:40.721
No!

01:09:42.095 --> 01:09:43.265
Just stay down.

01:09:43.805 --> 01:09:45.305
Lock this door as
soon as I step out.

01:09:46.349 --> 01:09:48.475
Okay? It'll be fine.

01:09:58.277 --> 01:10:01.827
"(Donny yells)
-(footsteps gallop away)

01:10:03.615 --> 01:10:04.537
(gunshot)

01:10:04.617 --> 01:10:06.585
Paul: Donny! You all right?

01:10:06.661 --> 01:10:07.752
- Paul: You all right?
- Donny: Yeah.

01:10:08.453 --> 01:10:09.454
Paul: Did you see it?

01:10:09.622 --> 01:10:11.043
It just knocked into me.

01:10:12.457 --> 01:10:14.836
All right, let's gather
everyone left in town.

01:10:16.045 --> 01:10:17.136
We'll stay at the church
tonight.

01:10:17.462 --> 01:10:21.764
(wind blows)

01:10:27.931 --> 01:10:30.275
You all know about
the tracks found

01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:31.648
going through town, this week.

01:10:33.563 --> 01:10:37.658
Yesterday, we discovered
the bodies of two men

01:10:38.650 --> 01:10:40.493
in the woods just
outside of town.

01:10:40.944 --> 01:10:44.039
Now, what left those tracks
also killed those men.

01:10:44.698 --> 01:10:45.951
A lot of people
have long believed

01:10:46.033 --> 01:10:48.832
that something
lives in our woods.

01:10:49.787 --> 01:10:52.414
I didn't wanna alarm any of
you until I knew for certain,

01:10:52.998 --> 01:10:54.921
but tonight it attacked my home.

01:10:57.753 --> 01:10:59.006
A few weeks ago,

01:11:00.338 --> 01:11:03.091
a logging camp opened up
90 miles north of here.

01:11:04.510 --> 01:11:07.434
We believe that it drove
the creature south,

01:11:07.930 --> 01:11:09.351
looking for a new home.

01:11:11.184 --> 01:11:13.185
With the animals on the
run, it's looking for food.

01:11:14.436 --> 01:11:15.484
And it found us.

01:11:16.605 --> 01:11:17.653
It's strong.

01:11:18.608 --> 01:11:20.234
It's fast, and it's smart.

01:11:21.527 --> 01:11:23.699
But I believe that we can
get through this together.

01:11:26.573 --> 01:11:27.871
So we're gonna stay here,
tonight.

01:11:29.702 --> 01:11:31.123
As soon as that storm passes

01:11:31.203 --> 01:11:33.332
and the roads clear
in the morning,

01:11:34.039 --> 01:11:35.212
the Forest Department will have

01:11:35.792 --> 01:11:37.760
Rangers crawling
all over these woods

01:11:37.835 --> 01:11:39.087
to hunt this thing down.

01:11:39.545 --> 01:11:42.798
How many Rangers, Sheriff?

01:11:43.757 --> 01:11:45.180
Dozens.

01:11:46.551 --> 01:11:50.351
All we have to do is get
through the night, and we will.

01:11:51.181 --> 01:11:53.059
How do we know it
won't just find us, here?

01:11:54.435 --> 01:11:56.436
It's a trap, like a
bunch of damned rats.

01:11:57.270 --> 01:12:00.992
This church, it's our best
and only option.

01:12:02.068 --> 01:12:03.740
Paul: It's strong,
it's defendable.

01:12:04.737 --> 01:12:07.581
Once morning comes,
you'll be safe.

01:12:08.949 --> 01:12:10.372
This is where we need to be.

01:12:13.787 --> 01:12:18.385
(wind blows)

01:12:25.925 --> 01:12:27.016
(gun clicks)

01:12:42.024 --> 01:12:44.618
Ah, thank you.

01:12:51.993 --> 01:12:53.085
Susan: Is it that bad?

01:12:55.453 --> 01:12:57.456
(Paul sighs)
Oh, no, it's uh...

01:13:01.543 --> 01:13:02.966
It's just a precaution.

01:13:05.715 --> 01:13:07.466
You never were
a good liar, Paul.

01:13:16.893 --> 01:13:18.314
That's all right,
I gave it up.

01:13:19.145 --> 01:13:20.317
Good man.

01:13:20.813 --> 01:13:22.907
Situation like this,
most men start drinking.

01:13:23.815 --> 01:13:25.738
You don't seem too worried,
yourself.

01:13:25.818 --> 01:13:28.320
Ah, worrying never added
a day to anybody's life.

01:13:29.863 --> 01:13:31.582
You know what happens
after a forest fire?

01:13:32.658 --> 01:13:34.251
Land comes back stronger.

01:13:36.162 --> 01:13:37.378
Well...

01:13:38.331 --> 01:13:40.173
I guess I'm drinking
for both of us, huh?

01:13:44.337 --> 01:13:46.180
Susan: Adam wanted to
draw, he was bored.

01:14:12.823 --> 01:14:13.823
(Donny laughs quietly)

01:14:14.908 --> 01:14:16.126
So what are we drinking to?

01:14:17.494 --> 01:14:18.542
Hope.

01:14:18.871 --> 01:14:20.122
Sometimes that's all you got.

01:14:29.547 --> 01:14:31.766
I guess hope is
what we'll roll with, huh?

01:14:37.055 --> 01:14:38.148
- Donny: Hey.
- Hey.

01:14:42.144 --> 01:14:43.145
How you doing?

01:14:45.730 --> 01:14:46.856
Susan: You were good out there.

01:14:49.109 --> 01:14:50.532
I'm serious, Paul.

01:14:53.113 --> 01:14:54.832
They believe that
you can protect them.

01:14:55.908 --> 01:14:57.909
That no matter what happens,
they can trust you.

01:15:02.539 --> 01:15:04.257
I can't protect these people.

01:15:08.378 --> 01:15:09.505
I couldn't protect Tim.

01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:13.091
It wasn't your fault.

01:15:14.676 --> 01:15:16.179
He loved you so much.

01:15:16.804 --> 01:15:18.271
He wouldn't want you to be sad.

01:15:19.806 --> 01:15:20.854
I've been...

01:15:21.684 --> 01:15:23.356
I've been seeing him, lately.

01:15:26.104 --> 01:15:29.109
He's there
and then he disappears.

01:15:34.070 --> 01:15:35.743
I feel like I'm going crazy.

01:15:37.699 --> 01:15:39.122
Maybe...

01:15:39.201 --> 01:15:41.920
He just wants you to know
that everything is okay?

01:15:42.328 --> 01:15:43.329
I shoulda been there.

01:15:45.373 --> 01:15:47.126
I shoulda protected him.

01:15:51.046 --> 01:15:55.301
I am so sorry, Susan.

01:15:56.301 --> 01:15:57.474
I'm so sorry.

01:15:58.261 --> 01:15:59.604
I shouldn't have moved out.

01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:02.024
I shouldn't have let you
think that I didn't need you.

01:16:02.099 --> 01:16:03.567
Because I need you, Paul.

01:16:03.641 --> 01:16:04.814
Adam needs you.

01:16:07.979 --> 01:16:09.402
These people need you.

01:16:26.873 --> 01:16:28.171
(sudden thud against the doors)

01:16:31.628 --> 01:16:32.720
- Adam: Mom!
- Susan: Adam!

01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:36.432
-(heavy thud)
-(creature growls)

01:16:36.509 --> 01:16:37.510
Boss!

01:16:44.015 --> 01:16:45.063
Donny: Boss!

01:16:46.351 --> 01:16:47.569
(muffled thud)

01:16:49.979 --> 01:16:51.072
(people exclaim)

01:16:51.148 --> 01:16:52.820
Man: It's okay, here, come on.

01:16:52.899 --> 01:16:53.947
Come on, come on.

01:16:54.568 --> 01:16:56.194
I gotcha. Stay with--

01:16:56.278 --> 01:16:58.029
-(loud thuds)
-(several people cry out)

01:16:59.532 --> 01:17:01.125
Everyone away from the
windows and the door.

01:17:02.201 --> 01:17:03.247
Paul: Just stay calm.

01:17:03.868 --> 01:17:04.994
Donny: Stay calm, everybody.

01:17:07.497 --> 01:17:11.219
-(creature growls)
-(door thuds)

01:17:12.418 --> 01:17:14.887
-(gun cocks)
-(door thuds)

01:17:15.381 --> 01:17:16.427
You think it's gonna hold?

01:17:17.466 --> 01:17:19.389
No, I don't.

01:17:21.886 --> 01:17:23.059
The basement...

01:17:23.305 --> 01:17:24.806
It was a shelter
in the 60s, right?

01:17:24.890 --> 01:17:25.856
Yeah, but it's jam packed.

01:17:25.932 --> 01:17:27.024
I don't think we'll all fit.

01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:28.226
It's gonna have to do.

01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:29.856
Come on!
Everyone downstairs, let's go.

01:17:30.563 --> 01:17:31.689
Let's

01:17:31.771 --> 01:17:32.863
(people speak over
each other excitedly)

01:17:32.939 --> 01:17:34.065
Donny: Come on,
now, let's go, quickly.

01:17:35.067 --> 01:17:37.489
(door pounds)

01:17:37.569 --> 01:17:38.695
Go, go, go. Go.

01:17:41.448 --> 01:17:46.453
-(people chatter)
- Ron: Watch your step.

01:17:49.497 --> 01:17:52.001
Donny: Come on, guys. Quick!

01:17:55.421 --> 01:17:59.596
(pounding continues
from upstairs)

01:18:04.095 --> 01:18:06.519
Donny, get these rifles ready.

01:18:06.599 --> 01:18:07.815
Lock and guard the door.

01:18:07.891 --> 01:18:08.859
- Donny: Wait, wait,
- Susan: What's going on?

01:18:08.934 --> 01:18:09.900
Donny: where are you going?

01:18:09.976 --> 01:18:11.069
(pounding intensifies upstairs)

01:18:14.814 --> 01:18:16.112
Those doors aren't
gonna hold much longer.

01:18:16.192 --> 01:18:17.444
Don't go.

01:18:17.693 --> 01:18:19.569
It's gonna be okay,
the doors are gonna hold.

01:18:20.154 --> 01:18:21.154
I love you.

01:18:21.905 --> 01:18:23.122
I love you, too.

01:18:27.286 --> 01:18:28.958
-(doors pound)
-(several people exclaim)

01:18:29.371 --> 01:18:31.372
Buddy, come on, give me a hug.

01:18:31.457 --> 01:18:32.958
Where's my hug? Come on.

01:18:37.503 --> 01:18:38.971
Where are you going?

01:18:40.298 --> 01:18:42.643
I gotta take care of you
and your mommy, all right?

01:18:43.301 --> 01:18:44.519
But you gotta do me a favor.

01:18:46.512 --> 01:18:47.729
You look after her
while I'm gone.

01:18:53.686 --> 01:18:54.734
Paul: Okay.

01:18:54.813 --> 01:18:55.984
I'm going up with you.

01:18:56.814 --> 01:18:57.907
That's what I'm here for.

01:18:57.983 --> 01:19:00.155
Donny, someone's
gotta stay down here

01:19:00.235 --> 01:19:01.453
and protect these people.

01:19:02.779 --> 01:19:04.032
Earl and I'll do it, Sheriff.

01:19:05.323 --> 01:19:06.324
Earl: Your deputy's right.

01:19:06.742 --> 01:19:07.708
You going up there alone

01:19:07.784 --> 01:19:08.832
isn't doing anybody any good.

01:19:10.246 --> 01:19:11.417
We'll hold here.

01:19:11.956 --> 01:19:13.457
I won't take my
gun off that door.

01:19:14.123 --> 01:19:15.501
-(Paul sighs)
- Come on.

01:19:20.588 --> 01:19:21.636
You hold that door.

01:19:22.757 --> 01:19:23.805
Yes, sir.
