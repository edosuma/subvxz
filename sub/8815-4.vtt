00:01.421 --> 00:03.336
<i>Previously on</i> Lucifer...

00:03.371 --> 00:05.336
You're the Lord of Hell,
for crying out loud.

00:05.371 --> 00:07.842
I'm retired, Maze. I've
got nothing but time.

00:07.877 --> 00:08.986
How could you possibly help me?

00:09.021 --> 00:12.296
I have the ability to draw
out people's forbidden desires.

00:12.331 --> 00:13.729
I got it. The name,

00:13.764 --> 00:14.793
the whole Lucifer thing,

00:14.828 --> 00:16.062
and desire's like your superpower.

00:16.097 --> 00:17.463
It's more like a gift from God, really.

00:17.498 --> 00:19.971
I saw Lucifer do some
things that I can't explain.

00:20.006 --> 00:21.713
Is Lucifer a magician?

00:21.748 --> 00:23.915
That's sort of what I'm
trying to figure out.

00:23.950 --> 00:27.335
You were once the brightest
of all of God's angels.

00:27.370 --> 00:30.287
And now, your time here on Earth

00:30.322 --> 00:31.788
is affecting you, dear brother.

00:31.823 --> 00:32.807
You're changing.

00:32.842 --> 00:34.475
My life is change.

00:34.510 --> 00:38.016
- What are you doing here?
- Ooh, how's your ex? Detective Douche?

00:38.051 --> 00:40.325
You like working with
the detective, don't you?

00:40.360 --> 00:42.236
I told you, I'm good at punishing people.

00:42.271 --> 00:44.791
Nay, I'm the best at punishing bad people.

00:44.826 --> 00:48.841
Yeah, well, I think you don't
just enjoy punishing the bad guys.

00:48.876 --> 00:53.498
I think you're starting to like
seeking justice for the good ones.

02:29.793 --> 02:30.808
Well,

02:30.843 --> 02:33.017
good morning, Detective.

02:35.435 --> 02:37.478
What the hell are you doing here?

02:37.513 --> 02:39.912
- Setting the table.
- You broke into my house?

02:39.947 --> 02:41.531
Yes, well, I hope you don't
mind, but I made a little brekkie.

02:41.566 --> 02:43.576
You were taking forever in the shower.

02:43.836 --> 02:45.451
What do you do in there?

02:45.486 --> 02:46.943
You are unbelievable!

02:46.978 --> 02:50.008
Oh, thank you, but it's you
who should take the compliment.

02:50.043 --> 02:52.509
Really kept things up since <i>Hot
Tub High School,</i> haven't we?

02:52.544 --> 02:53.437
Ding-dong.

02:53.472 --> 02:55.369
(sighs) I want to shoot you.

02:55.404 --> 02:56.761
Tease. Do it.

02:56.796 --> 02:57.982
I'm immortal, remember?

02:58.017 --> 03:00.062
Uh, do you have any truffle oil?

03:00.164 --> 03:02.354
Lucifer, get out of my house now.

03:02.389 --> 03:04.182
- We haven't eaten yet.
- Out.

03:04.217 --> 03:05.812
Well, don't we need to
discuss the next case?

03:05.847 --> 03:07.689
There is no next case.

03:07.724 --> 03:08.651
- What?
- Out.

03:08.686 --> 03:10.296
We're already late, so let's go.

03:10.331 --> 03:11.268
Lucifer!

03:11.303 --> 03:12.835
Yeah.

03:12.870 --> 03:14.281
What in God's name are you doing here?

03:14.316 --> 03:16.280
Nothing in his name.
Here on my own, actually.

03:16.316 --> 03:18.817
BEATRICE: Did you and
Mommy have a sleepover?

03:18.852 --> 03:21.784
CHLOE: No. No. Absolutely not, no.

03:21.819 --> 03:23.924
What are you guys doing here anyway?

03:24.049 --> 03:25.928
She left her bird report here.

03:25.963 --> 03:27.692
- BEATRICE: Want to see?
- Um, not really.

03:27.727 --> 03:29.916
Here, have a snack, child.

03:31.667 --> 03:33.816
Are you sleeping with this idiot?

03:33.917 --> 03:36.518
She hasn't had the
pleasure, unfortunately, no.

03:37.170 --> 03:39.328
Okay, everybody out.
Trixie has to get to school.

03:39.363 --> 03:41.669
I got to get to work. Come on, out, please.

03:41.704 --> 03:44.411
No, no, no, no, no, you
can't throw me out again.

03:44.550 --> 03:45.676
Again?

03:45.796 --> 03:47.011
So this is a habit.

03:47.047 --> 03:48.630
- Yes, shocking, isn't it?
- No.

03:48.665 --> 03:50.498
Never been thrown out of
anywhere before in my life.

03:50.533 --> 03:52.250
Well, except for Heaven, of course.

03:53.420 --> 03:55.601
Fine, fine, fine, fine.

03:55.636 --> 03:58.055
But somebody please flip the
omelet if it's not already ruined.

03:58.090 --> 03:59.791
Hey, Dan, I'm...

04:00.119 --> 04:01.526

- Lucifer, we don't have an appointment.

04:24.941 --> 04:26.440
Something very disturbing's just happened.

04:26.475 --> 04:28.006
It's horrific, really.

04:28.041 --> 04:30.568
Uh, for the second time,

04:30.603 --> 04:31.907
I've been thrown out of a woman's house.

04:31.942 --> 04:33.725
- Okay, sorry, uh, Lu...
- I mean, I'm starting to wonder

04:33.760 --> 04:35.946
if the detective has some
sort of biological dysfunction.

04:35.981 --> 04:37.565
- Lucifer.
- 'Cause, I mean, I appeal

04:37.600 --> 04:38.941
to the feral urge in all women.

04:38.976 --> 04:41.688
Certainly, well, certainly you
can attest to that, can't you?

04:41.723 --> 04:43.155
Uh, Lucifer, stop.

04:43.190 --> 04:44.744
Yes, of course, sorry. Payment first.

04:44.779 --> 04:47.505
Uh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no. No! No!

04:47.540 --> 04:48.745
Hmm?

04:48.780 --> 04:52.281
Lucifer, this is George.

04:53.318 --> 04:54.894
George, Lucifer.

04:55.048 --> 04:56.981
Lucifer, George.

04:57.050 --> 04:59.684
(chuckles softly)

04:59.719 --> 05:01.385
Oops.

05:10.363 --> 05:12.630
- Dan, if you're here to scold me...
- No.

05:12.806 --> 05:15.422
I just got off the phone
with the lieutenant.

05:15.534 --> 05:17.134
There's a case.

05:18.479 --> 05:19.845
Day four.

05:19.913 --> 05:22.813
Down to three meat sticks,
a half a bottle of water,

05:22.951 --> 05:25.551
217 miles to L.A.

05:25.641 --> 05:27.541
I'm not sure we're gonna make it,

05:27.647 --> 05:31.030
'cause my brother drives
like a narcoleptic old lady.

05:31.093 --> 05:33.117
Say hi, Grandma!

05:33.153 --> 05:34.627
(laughs)

05:34.662 --> 05:36.883
No, that's our only nourishment!

05:36.918 --> 05:38.914
DAN: Her name's Lindsay Jolson.

05:38.964 --> 05:40.405
Just turned 22.

05:40.507 --> 05:42.818
She went missing catering
a Players' Club event.

05:42.904 --> 05:43.957
Players' Club?

05:43.992 --> 05:45.824
It's one of those skeezy
pickup artist groups.

05:45.859 --> 05:48.166
You know, that teach
geeks how to be sex gods.

05:48.314 --> 05:49.095
Got it.

05:49.130 --> 05:51.969
Lindsay was last seen
talking to the lead scumbag.

05:53.664 --> 05:56.073
The founder, Carver Cruz.

05:56.689 --> 05:57.926
So he was interrogated?

05:57.961 --> 06:00.232
Yep, but his lawyer did all the talking.

06:00.267 --> 06:01.752
And with no proof, we're stuck.

06:01.787 --> 06:04.248
But there's a Players'
seminar and after-party today.

06:04.284 --> 06:05.938
And you need to go undercover.

06:05.973 --> 06:07.557
Why me? I'm homicide.

06:07.592 --> 06:08.975
Because you're our best way in.

06:09.010 --> 06:10.196
- I am?
- Apparently these events

06:10.231 --> 06:12.219
are pretty exclusive, and
when I saw the guest list,

06:12.254 --> 06:14.157
I recognized one of the names.

06:14.298 --> 06:17.698
I guess a lot of high-end
club owners are invited.

06:17.893 --> 06:19.426
Oh, come on.

06:19.504 --> 06:21.032
No. You're kidding.

06:21.067 --> 06:22.764
(chuckles) I wish I was.

06:22.799 --> 06:24.777
- Lucifer's on the list?
- Yeah.

06:24.812 --> 06:26.608
Yeah, of course he is.

06:26.643 --> 06:28.161
(sighs)

06:28.258 --> 06:30.483
Look...

06:30.587 --> 06:33.669
the last thing I want is the guy I found

06:33.704 --> 06:35.592
making my half-naked wife
breakfast this morning

06:35.627 --> 06:37.082
spending more time with her,

06:37.117 --> 06:38.883
separated or not.

06:39.482 --> 06:40.284
But...

06:40.320 --> 06:42.296
This is the best option.

06:42.370 --> 06:45.113
I wouldn't ask, but I just keep thinking,

06:45.685 --> 06:48.158
what if this was our daughter?

06:51.274 --> 06:54.595
The detective seems
like a very lovely woman.

06:54.630 --> 06:56.351
Well, I suppose, but still, she's human.

06:56.386 --> 06:58.803
Why is she able to refuse my charms?

06:58.838 --> 07:00.543
I mean, is this thing on?

07:00.578 --> 07:03.012
Yes, yes.

07:03.288 --> 07:05.855
Definitely on.

07:07.146 --> 07:08.033
(sighs)

07:08.087 --> 07:11.518
It's not that you're afraid that
you don't have power over Chloe.

07:11.607 --> 07:14.187
It's that you're afraid
that she has power over you,

07:14.222 --> 07:15.800
but neither one is true.

07:15.835 --> 07:17.221
- No?
- No.

07:17.369 --> 07:20.258
People don't have power over us.

07:20.293 --> 07:22.326
We give it to them.

07:22.362 --> 07:24.723
You have to take your power back.

07:24.963 --> 07:26.046
Right, go on.

07:26.130 --> 07:30.670
You say she's nothing special, but
I think you've put her on a pedestal.

07:30.779 --> 07:33.004
You need to really get to know her,

07:33.039 --> 07:35.341
warts and all. (chuckles)

07:35.376 --> 07:37.331
I'm sure she has some.

07:37.366 --> 07:38.772
(chuckles)

07:38.807 --> 07:42.788
So, (clears throat) demystify her

07:42.905 --> 07:45.766
by bringing her back
down to your own level.

07:48.278 --> 07:49.777
You're right.

07:49.850 --> 07:51.591
It's not her, it's me.

07:51.653 --> 07:53.683
I need to take back control.

07:53.718 --> 07:55.723
I need to behave like I always have.

07:55.779 --> 07:57.649
Good. So you understand.

07:57.713 --> 07:58.545
Yes.

07:58.589 --> 07:59.718
Yes. (chuckles)

07:59.753 --> 08:02.520
I mean, it seems obvious now, actually.

08:02.555 --> 08:04.415
I need to have sex with her.

08:04.477 --> 08:07.249
Uh... no, uh, that's not what I said.

08:07.310 --> 08:10.847
No, no, no, you're a genius. I mean,
that's the best way to lose interest, right?

08:10.933 --> 08:12.668
Right. Good-o.

08:13.125 --> 08:14.044
Hmm.

08:14.079 --> 08:14.772
Thanks, love.

08:14.807 --> 08:16.455
Oh, sure.

08:16.670 --> 08:18.973
- Payment next time, okay?
- Uh...

08:19.617 --> 08:21.250
Um...

08:28.874 --> 08:30.561
CHLOE: Her name's Lindsay Jolson.

08:30.596 --> 08:31.295
Mm-hmm.

08:31.330 --> 08:33.994
She's been missing almost three full days.

08:34.272 --> 08:36.162
Right, so just ask me one more time.

08:36.240 --> 08:37.886
Lucifer, there's a girl missing.

08:37.922 --> 08:39.695
(chuckles) Yes, it's just not every day

08:39.730 --> 08:43.282
someone kicks you out of your house,
then three hours later asks you on a date.

08:43.335 --> 08:45.666
It's not a date. It's a work thing.

08:45.743 --> 08:48.235
- Oh.
- And are you gonna help me or not?

08:48.868 --> 08:49.975
All right.

08:50.116 --> 08:53.351
But only 'cause it coincides
perfectly with my own plan.

08:53.898 --> 08:55.019
And what plan is that?

08:55.054 --> 08:57.321
Well, to have sex with you, of course.

08:57.669 --> 08:59.079
(laughs) Okay.

08:59.114 --> 09:01.766
Wait, you and I... well,
there is no you and I.

09:01.801 --> 09:03.473
There's a professional situation,

09:03.508 --> 09:05.496
- and I just need you...
- See, you need me.

09:05.531 --> 09:07.445
The department needs you,
because you're the one...

09:07.480 --> 09:08.799
I'm the one?

09:09.679 --> 09:11.717
On the list for the Player thing.

09:11.752 --> 09:13.738
You're quite adorable
when you're flustered.

09:13.773 --> 09:16.368
I... I'm not flustered.

09:16.403 --> 09:17.199
I'm nauseous.

09:17.281 --> 09:19.544
Now you're blushing; I'd
say I'm making headway.

09:19.610 --> 09:24.428
Okay, look, let me make
myself perfectly clear.

09:24.577 --> 09:26.217
I will never,

09:26.252 --> 09:29.420
ever, ever sleep with you.

09:29.503 --> 09:30.821
Never.

09:30.857 --> 09:32.323
Okay? Got it?

09:32.358 --> 09:34.158
Playing hard to get, I like it.

09:34.193 --> 09:36.727
When Hell freezes over, Lucifer.

09:36.763 --> 09:38.329
I can arrange that, actually.

09:38.418 --> 09:40.368
Get in the car.

And here's something else you might need.

10:12.360 --> 10:13.356
(chuckles)

10:13.391 --> 10:15.410
Well, yes, that might come in handy.

10:15.561 --> 10:17.261
Pardon the pun.

10:18.724 --> 10:19.729
Whoa.

10:19.915 --> 10:22.802
Did you just number close the nametag girl?

10:22.837 --> 10:24.601
Oh.

more of a leg man myself.

10:50.257 --> 10:51.804

- No, you don't.

10:58.736 --> 11:00.603

to leave the premises.

11:00.639 --> 11:03.473
Oh, I don't think that'll

No, but...

11:55.609 --> 11:57.794
She's a good person. She's sweet.

11:57.829 --> 12:01.012
She wouldn't just run off.
She's not even from L.A.

12:01.331 --> 12:03.595

12:15.165 --> 12:16.713
Okay. It's time to go now.

12:16.748 --> 12:19.939

hear anything, we'll be in touch.

12:20.006 --> 12:21.355
Okay. Thank you.

12:21.452 --> 12:22.269
Yeah.

12:22.330 --> 12:23.873
We've got this.

12:25.366 --> 12:27.162
You have to admit, we're quite a good team.

12:27.208 --> 12:31.290
If you weren't so pent-up sexually,
we'd be firing on all cylinders, I'd say.

12:37.597 --> 12:40.391
I'm assuming you learned most of
your moves at events like these.

12:40.443 --> 12:42.291
I've never been to something
like this before in my life.

12:42.326 --> 12:44.591
I certainly don't need any
help getting women into bed.

12:44.626 --> 12:45.625

LUCIFER: No, but it's quite pressing.

14:50.702 --> 14:54.852
What if you have all those manly whatnots
and a woman still doesn't respond?

14:54.887 --> 14:58.054
You may think you have them, but you don't.

14:58.089 --> 14:59.594
- Yeah.
- That's why you're here, right?

14:59.629 --> 15:01.878
So, gentlemen, you follow these rules,

15:01.957 --> 15:05.574
and you will bed any Betty
you desire, guaranteed.

15:05.609 --> 15:08.818
LUCIFER: No. No. No, no, no. I'm certain
I've got everything on your little list,

15:08.853 --> 15:10.587
and more, actually,

15:10.622 --> 15:14.347
yet this woman here won't have sex with me.

15:14.480 --> 15:16.350
(laughter)

15:16.453 --> 15:18.661
Just listen to the speech, buddy.

15:18.737 --> 15:20.180
The system works.

15:20.244 --> 15:21.919
No, but I doubt that.

15:21.974 --> 15:24.411
Because... because if
I can't "bed a Betty,"

15:24.446 --> 15:26.179

Yeah, Lucifer, sit down.

the spotlight over here?

15:39.217 --> 15:40.352

15:40.387 --> 15:42.785
Yeah, yeah. But on-on her.

15:42.902 --> 15:44.425
Good. Right.

15:44.460 --> 15:45.821
Now, you're the expert.

15:45.892 --> 15:47.458
You tell me what's wrong with this picture.

15:47.493 --> 15:49.512
I mean, I'm me.

15:49.547 --> 15:50.154
Right?

15:50.189 --> 15:51.461
And she...

15:51.496 --> 15:53.363
Well, she's a cop, for starters.

15:53.398 --> 15:54.197
(crowd grumbles)

15:54.232 --> 15:55.898
She's a cop?

15:55.934 --> 15:58.188
Yes. I mean, talk about the
shallow end of the dating pool.

15:58.233 --> 15:59.623
This is private property.

15:59.658 --> 16:02.379
Unless you have a warrant, you
need to leave here immediately.

16:02.414 --> 16:03.473
Security!

16:03.508 --> 16:04.808
Security, her, out.

16:04.843 --> 16:06.736
Okay, we're gonna take a
ten-minute intermission.

16:06.771 --> 16:09.711
- All right? Thank you.
- I haven't finished.

16:09.900 --> 16:11.301
All right.

16:11.435 --> 16:13.435
Oh, it's you again.

16:15.382 --> 16:17.816
Have you two...?

16:20.174 --> 16:22.291
I know. I'm-I'm sorry, Lieutenant.

16:22.326 --> 16:23.934
I... No. No.

16:23.969 --> 16:25.628
I've got it under control.

16:25.664 --> 16:27.166
And Mr. Morningstar, too, yes.

16:27.201 --> 16:28.499
Let me talk to him.

16:28.534 --> 16:29.667
It's a her, and no.

16:29.702 --> 16:31.100
Really? Your boss is a she?

16:31.161 --> 16:32.689
Even better. Give me
the phone, I'll fix it.

16:32.724 --> 16:33.910
No, you can't fix this!

16:33.945 --> 16:35.438
You've already said enough.

16:35.542 --> 16:36.220
Sorry!

16:36.292 --> 16:38.092
Not you.

16:38.221 --> 16:41.048
Yes, I-I'll figure out
a way into the party.

16:41.083 --> 16:42.157
It's not a problem.

16:42.192 --> 16:44.883
And-and again, I...

16:45.117 --> 16:48.615
So we're going to the Player after-party.

16:48.717 --> 16:49.690
Not you. I am.

16:49.725 --> 16:52.169
Well, I'm not sure how that's possible,
now that you've blown your cover.

16:52.204 --> 16:53.733
Well, that was 100% your fault.

16:53.768 --> 16:55.191
I beg to differ.

16:55.226 --> 16:57.809
None of that would have happened if
you'd just complied with my request.

16:57.844 --> 17:00.822
Do you honestly think you can just ask
people to have sex with you and they will?

17:00.857 --> 17:02.532
Well, I usually don't
have to ask, actually.

17:02.567 --> 17:04.304
But trust me, it'd be a win-win.

17:04.339 --> 17:05.460
And probably another win after that.

17:05.494 --> 17:07.672
I mean, I have tremendous stamina.

17:07.707 --> 17:09.489
There's a girl missing, Lucifer.

17:09.523 --> 17:11.324
She's probably in some hellhole somewhere,

17:11.358 --> 17:13.483
scared out of her mind,
if she's even still alive.

17:13.519 --> 17:16.266
And I found out the party
is a cash-only event.

17:16.300 --> 17:17.605
That's a first for Carver.

17:17.640 --> 17:20.967
So our only suspect's probably
about to run off to Mexico,

17:21.006 --> 17:23.118
and you're worried about boning me?

17:23.154 --> 17:24.681
You're right. Sorry.

17:24.760 --> 17:25.954
- Let's find the girl. Okay?
- Yes.

17:25.990 --> 17:27.694
Sex later.

17:27.839 --> 17:28.992
Kidding.

17:29.067 --> 17:29.992
Sort of.

17:30.028 --> 17:30.687
(sighs)

17:30.722 --> 17:32.295
So where's the party?

17:32.330 --> 17:33.486
Cold Bar.

17:33.521 --> 17:34.597
Really?

17:34.632 --> 17:37.033
Well, that place is
notoriously overpriced to rent.

17:37.068 --> 17:39.768
If Carver wants cash, he
shouldn't have it there.

17:41.330 --> 17:43.430
No, he shouldn't.

17:45.598 --> 17:48.004
I think I just figured
out how you can fix this.

17:48.044 --> 17:49.103

17:49.180 --> 17:50.883
Do tell.

30:25.269 --> 30:27.559
Do I scare you?

30:30.274 --> 30:31.674
No.

30:36.436 --> 30:37.716
Is that Carver?

30:37.779 --> 30:39.078
Hmm?

30:40.334 --> 30:42.254
How did he get here?

30:42.328 --> 30:43.325
Oh, he must have followed us.

30:43.360 --> 30:45.396
- Well done, Detective.
- CHLOE: No, he didn't follow us.

30:45.466 --> 30:47.045
He must have gotten the address somehow.

30:47.080 --> 30:48.578
Or someone told him.

30:48.613 --> 30:52.013
Either way, he's gonna get
someone killed, probably himself.

30:53.090 --> 30:56.114
This love thing makes you
all quite stupid, doesn't it?

31:10.047 --> 31:12.181
(whispers): Lucifer!

31:16.520 --> 31:18.654
(whispers): Lucifer!

31:22.994 --> 31:23.854
(lock clicks)

31:23.889 --> 31:26.905
Sorry, but I gave my word... no police.

31:26.976 --> 31:28.054
Seriously?

31:28.117 --> 31:29.341
Don't worry, Detective.

31:29.376 --> 31:30.899
I'm immortal, remember?

31:30.986 --> 31:33.639
- I knew it.
- (line ringing)

31:33.733 --> 31:35.653
Hey, guys, I'm gonna need
you sooner than I thought.

31:35.688 --> 31:36.897
Is SWAT ready?

31:47.330 --> 31:49.564
♪ ♪

32:02.045 --> 32:03.010
(screams)

32:03.046 --> 32:03.848
(chuckles)

32:03.883 --> 32:04.941
Manly as ever.

32:04.976 --> 32:06.237
Why are you here?

32:06.272 --> 32:07.713
We had a perfectly good plan in place.

32:07.748 --> 32:10.219
Well, after you left, the
kidnappers called back.

32:10.254 --> 32:14.216
They said they changed their
minds, and I come or the deal's off.

32:14.281 --> 32:16.748
Oh, that sounds sinister.

32:17.474 --> 32:19.594
Just hand over the cash,

32:19.707 --> 32:21.078
and no one gets hurt.

32:21.113 --> 32:23.046
Yes, right. Got it here.

32:23.140 --> 32:25.474
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait! Where's Lindsay?!

32:25.547 --> 32:26.565
I want to see her.

32:26.600 --> 32:29.136
No. My rules.

32:29.172 --> 32:30.089
Money first.

32:30.134 --> 32:33.008
Now, Mr. Kidnapper, I believe
that's a fair request actually,

32:33.079 --> 32:35.813
so just pop her around
and the money's yours.

32:38.448 --> 32:40.815
(grunting)

32:40.850 --> 32:42.846
Greedy little jackal, aren't you?

32:42.924 --> 32:43.781
Give it to me!

32:43.816 --> 32:45.840
(chuckles) Most certainly will not.

32:45.942 --> 32:47.653
CARVER: Hey, f-forget it!

32:47.749 --> 32:50.240
Just-just give it to him!

32:50.544 --> 32:52.450
I just want her back.

32:52.866 --> 32:54.066
LUCIFER: Fine.

32:55.283 --> 32:56.597
Now bring us the girl.

32:56.633 --> 32:58.144
I'm sorry.

32:58.206 --> 32:59.285
That's not gonna happen.

32:59.377 --> 33:00.496
- (chuckles)
- What?

33:00.531 --> 33:01.569
I will kill you!

33:01.631 --> 33:03.634
Oh, it's gonna happen.

33:04.567 --> 33:05.840
A deal's a deal.

33:05.875 --> 33:08.209
I am not leaving here without Lindsay.

33:08.244 --> 33:10.431
No way.

33:12.248 --> 33:14.193
(sighs) Dearie me.

33:14.239 --> 33:16.839
What is it about you and guns, eh?

33:18.999 --> 33:20.966
(gunshot)

33:22.400 --> 33:23.658
Carver?

33:23.693 --> 33:25.373
Oh, no.

33:28.431 --> 33:30.298
(groans)

33:30.930 --> 33:32.416
Lindsay?

33:32.517 --> 33:34.402
LUCIFER: Wait. <i>Lindsay</i> Lindsay?

33:34.494 --> 33:35.725
Love of your life Lindsay?

33:35.778 --> 33:38.659
Yeah, sorry, but I can't
let you shoot my brother.

33:38.764 --> 33:40.450
What's up, jackass?

33:40.485 --> 33:41.781
I don't understand.

33:41.816 --> 33:43.744
Don't you though?

33:43.834 --> 33:47.238
This foul woman and her backwood
brother played the player.

33:47.273 --> 33:49.308
Lindsay kidnapped herself.

33:49.410 --> 33:51.959
Hell truly hath no fury
like a woman scorned.

33:51.994 --> 33:53.348
You did scorn her, didn't you?

33:53.395 --> 33:55.180
No. No.

33:55.215 --> 33:58.441
For the first time in my life, I didn't.

33:59.156 --> 34:01.256
I loved her.

34:02.270 --> 34:03.510
I love you.

34:03.600 --> 34:05.300
Love me?

34:05.518 --> 34:08.130
Are you kidding? You didn't
even remember my name!

34:08.193 --> 34:09.454
What are you talking about?

34:09.505 --> 34:12.183
I met you two years ago, Carver.

34:12.437 --> 34:14.196
We slept together.

34:14.540 --> 34:15.835
And then you never called again.

34:15.871 --> 34:18.553
Guess I was research for your stupid book.

34:18.632 --> 34:20.308
No, no, that's not possible.

34:20.373 --> 34:22.194
No, I-I would've remembered.

34:22.228 --> 34:23.617
Nope.

34:23.652 --> 34:25.605
I met you at the library.

34:25.683 --> 34:29.128
It's a good place to score desperate babes.

34:29.231 --> 34:31.502
That's in Chapter 11, I believe.

34:31.556 --> 34:32.793
Oh, that's bad.

34:32.828 --> 34:34.762
I was a virgin, Carver.

34:34.853 --> 34:36.170
That's worse. (chuckles)

34:36.205 --> 34:37.574
It was just another night for you,

34:37.648 --> 34:39.946
but it was a big deal for me.

34:39.981 --> 34:43.571
Oh, God, I'm... I am so sorry, Lindsay.

34:43.714 --> 34:45.688
I-I'm different now.

34:45.746 --> 34:48.170
No, I don't think so.

34:48.206 --> 34:49.311
But I am.

34:49.346 --> 34:50.510
Okay, may I speak now?

34:50.545 --> 34:52.404
Because I happen to be
an expert on punishment,

34:52.438 --> 34:54.563
and I'm not sure it fits the crime here.

34:54.599 --> 34:56.661
I mean, Carver made a mistake...

34:56.704 --> 34:58.453
well, several really...

34:58.488 --> 34:59.965
but...

35:00.045 --> 35:01.415
you're different.

35:01.491 --> 35:02.533
He's changed.

35:02.613 --> 35:05.668
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

35:06.044 --> 35:07.874
KEVIN: Shut up.

35:07.990 --> 35:10.223
You shouldn't even be here.

35:10.313 --> 35:11.779
Now you're dead, too.

35:11.861 --> 35:12.927
Shoot them, Linds.

35:13.002 --> 35:15.128
Sorry, can't let you do that, darling.

35:15.195 --> 35:16.968
I mean, I'm indestructible,

35:17.003 --> 35:18.203
but he's off limits as well, I'm afraid.

35:18.269 --> 35:20.627
No, she's right. I-I deserve it.

35:20.733 --> 35:22.275
No, you don't.

35:22.361 --> 35:24.316
Chlamydia, the clap,

35:24.351 --> 35:25.730
raging case of crabs...

35:25.785 --> 35:28.489
that's what you deserve, not death.

35:28.564 --> 35:31.116
(chuckles softly): And you...

35:31.419 --> 35:33.181
...how are you any better?

35:33.231 --> 35:36.570
Why do humans think they can
rectify one evil with another?

35:36.640 --> 35:38.733
(chuckles): I mean, it's
clearly the first time

35:38.804 --> 35:40.448
this reptile has truly loved a woman,

35:40.528 --> 35:41.786
and this is his reward?

35:41.887 --> 35:42.883
KEVIN: Get away from her!

35:42.991 --> 35:45.659
(grunts, coughs)

35:47.427 --> 35:48.158
(gasps)

35:48.193 --> 35:49.022
Oh, God.

35:49.187 --> 35:51.501
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry?

35:51.697 --> 35:53.174
Please don't hurt me.

35:53.209 --> 35:54.408
(sobbing)

35:54.444 --> 35:56.973
Why does everyone say that
before they're punished?

35:57.008 --> 35:58.651
Don't kill me!

35:59.465 --> 36:00.711
Lucifer.

36:01.009 --> 36:01.929
Don't move.

36:01.964 --> 36:04.271
LUCIFER: Detective, you should leave.

36:06.651 --> 36:07.822
Who are you?

36:09.078 --> 36:10.354
(Lindsay crying)

36:12.790 --> 36:15.024
What are you?

36:30.914 --> 36:32.056
CHLOE: Did you do this?

36:32.109 --> 36:34.252
I've been trying to
tell you, I'm the Devil.

36:34.287 --> 36:35.654
(panting)

36:35.817 --> 36:37.496
That's... that's not possible.

36:37.618 --> 36:40.056
I assure you, Detective, it is.

36:40.168 --> 36:42.827
I mean, you've said yourself,
there are things you can't explain.

36:42.955 --> 36:45.164
You need more proof? You've
got the gun. Come on, shoot me.

36:45.199 --> 36:47.032
No.

36:47.199 --> 36:48.467
I can't shoot you.

36:48.520 --> 36:51.436
Sure you can. Go on, give her
a squeeze, we'll be good to go.

36:51.471 --> 36:54.246
- No.
- Just shoot me, Detective!

36:54.312 --> 36:56.956
Please! Because maybe
you'll finally realize...

36:57.108 --> 36:58.908
(casing clatters on floor)

36:59.484 --> 37:01.275
Good for you!

37:01.808 --> 37:03.815
See? Hardly hurts.

37:03.850 --> 37:05.564
- (distant sirens wailing)
- I can't believe...

37:05.599 --> 37:07.723
Gah. Actually, no, it's
hurting a little bit.

37:07.840 --> 37:09.615
It's... Gah! It's hurting a lot.

37:09.748 --> 37:11.590
Son of a bitch, that really hurts!

37:11.625 --> 37:13.091
(sirens wailing, tires screeching)

37:14.594 --> 37:16.027
I'm bleeding.

37:16.063 --> 37:18.063
- You're bleeding.
- I'm bleeding.

37:18.098 --> 37:20.165
Oh, crap, of course you're bleeding.

37:20.200 --> 37:21.418
(indistinct police radio chatter)

37:21.496 --> 37:22.884
God, what have I done?

37:22.923 --> 37:25.315
I don't... I don't bleed. It's... (grunts)

37:27.452 --> 37:28.573
Lucifer,

37:28.608 --> 37:30.323
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

37:30.358 --> 37:31.713
What does this mean?

37:31.822 --> 37:32.753
Well, it means I shot you.

37:32.813 --> 37:34.624
And I'm an idiot, and I'm sorry.

37:34.699 --> 37:36.547
And I'm in so much trouble.

37:36.621 --> 37:39.308
Ah! It really hurts!

37:39.419 --> 37:41.386
(panting)

37:41.421 --> 37:44.189
(indistinct talking)

37:45.960 --> 37:48.037
What's happening to me?

37:49.763 --> 37:51.896
(siren wails)

37:53.100 --> 37:54.817
(indistinct chatter)

37:54.911 --> 37:58.169
(talking indistinctly)

38:00.607 --> 38:02.540
(talking indistinctly)

38:02.576 --> 38:04.451
(talking, laughing)

38:04.514 --> 38:06.544
Well, speak of the devil.

38:06.580 --> 38:10.281
Mr. Morningstar here was just telling
me everything you did in there.

38:10.317 --> 38:11.812
Right.

38:11.847 --> 38:12.686
Well, Lieutenant...

38:12.721 --> 38:14.614
LUCIFER: I was just telling
your boss if you hadn't acted

38:14.649 --> 38:16.839
in the way that you did, then,

38:17.042 --> 38:18.453
well, all hell would've broke loose.

38:18.530 --> 38:20.318
Isn't that right?

38:21.732 --> 38:22.728
Right.

38:22.763 --> 38:23.862
Mm.

38:25.068 --> 38:26.598
Absolutely. And, um...

38:26.633 --> 38:29.271
But you caught the bad
guys; that's the main thing.

38:29.306 --> 38:32.515
OLIVIA: Again, I'm sorry that you got
caught in the crossfire, Mr. Morningstar.

38:32.593 --> 38:34.749
Oh, it's just a graze. I hardly felt it.

38:34.784 --> 38:35.540
(chuckles)

38:35.575 --> 38:38.483
And call me Lucifer.

38:40.056 --> 38:42.201
Lucifer.

38:42.642 --> 38:44.909
(Olivia chuckles)

38:46.623 --> 38:49.291
Thank you again for all of your help.

38:49.334 --> 38:51.598
You are so welcome.

38:55.762 --> 38:57.896
- Bye, now.
- (chuckles)

39:02.936 --> 39:04.669
I thought you didn't lie.

39:04.704 --> 39:06.137
I don't.

39:07.507 --> 39:10.008
But I don't always tell
the whole truth. (chuckles)

39:10.043 --> 39:12.406
Thank you.

39:13.403 --> 39:15.914
You're welcome.

39:16.107 --> 39:18.357
Come on, I'll drive you home.

39:18.450 --> 39:21.148
I should bloody hope so,
now you've crippled me.

39:21.677 --> 39:22.642
Wuss.

39:22.743 --> 39:25.110
(chuckles)

39:28.538 --> 39:29.838
Thanks, Julia.

39:30.053 --> 39:32.153
Have a good night. Drive safe.

39:39.409 --> 39:40.674
Mommy!

39:40.807 --> 39:42.367
(chuckles): Hey!

39:42.429 --> 39:43.779
What are you doing up?

39:43.865 --> 39:45.543
Can't sleep when you're not home.

39:45.579 --> 39:46.845
Come on, I'll tuck you in.

39:46.880 --> 39:49.393
What's that on your shirt?

39:50.364 --> 39:51.676
Oh.

39:51.760 --> 39:54.594
Um, that's, uh... that's
ketchup from lunch.

39:54.659 --> 39:57.448
Nuh-uh. That's blood, Mom.

39:57.518 --> 39:59.544
Right. You're right.

39:59.622 --> 40:03.965
Well, um... I may have hit someone...

40:04.024 --> 40:04.810
with a bullet.

40:04.845 --> 40:07.780
You shot someone? Again?

40:07.897 --> 40:08.800
Barely.

40:08.835 --> 40:09.767
Who?

40:09.803 --> 40:10.703
It was Lucifer.

40:10.738 --> 40:12.570
- Is he okay?
- He's fine.

40:12.606 --> 40:13.514
It was nothing.

40:13.561 --> 40:16.350
It was, like, a little graze.

40:16.442 --> 40:18.316
Okay.

40:20.644 --> 40:22.078
What, babe?

40:22.188 --> 40:24.471
Remember last week, I
told you that boy Noah

40:24.561 --> 40:27.022
kept throwing French
fries at me at lunchtime?

40:27.057 --> 40:28.839
- Mm-hmm.
- And you said

40:28.903 --> 40:31.570
it actually might mean he likes me?

40:31.605 --> 40:32.334
Yes.

40:32.387 --> 40:35.848
Well, since you <i>shot</i> Lucifer,

40:35.941 --> 40:39.478
it must mean you <i>really</i> like him.

40:39.553 --> 40:42.287
(sighs)

40:42.598 --> 40:45.436
Hmm.

40:45.531 --> 40:47.839
You know, it is bedtime, you little weasel.

40:47.874 --> 40:50.934
- (both laugh)
- You weasel. I'm gonna get you.

40:51.012 --> 40:52.812
Story time! Story time!

40:56.483 --> 40:58.283
(door opens)

40:58.318 --> 40:59.284
(Lucifer groans)

40:59.319 --> 41:02.287
(panting)

41:02.322 --> 41:03.588
I know.

41:03.623 --> 41:04.913
Tough day at the office.

41:04.948 --> 41:05.770
What happened to you?

41:05.805 --> 41:07.666
Oh, you'll never guess.

41:07.860 --> 41:09.293
She shot me.

41:09.794 --> 41:11.043
And I bled.

41:11.129 --> 41:12.143
What?

41:12.256 --> 41:13.109
That's not possible.

41:13.208 --> 41:14.574
I know.

41:14.901 --> 41:16.197
What's causing this?

41:16.275 --> 41:17.618
Is there something you're not telling me?

41:17.653 --> 41:19.474
Don't think about it
too much. It's exciting.

41:19.532 --> 41:21.997
No, it's dangerous.

41:23.109 --> 41:26.811
We've had our fun here,
Lucifer, but this can't happen.

41:26.846 --> 41:28.479
(chuckles)

41:28.515 --> 41:30.982
Tell me we're going home.

41:31.017 --> 41:34.175
On the contrary, Maze.

41:34.927 --> 41:37.055
The fun's just begun.

41:37.090 --> 41:42.090
