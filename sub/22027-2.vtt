WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:01.502
.

00:01.535 --> 00:02.436
- School fire.
4548 West Quincy.

00:03.704 --> 00:04.772
- That's Donna's school!

00:04.805 --> 00:08.809
Donna!
- Wallace!

00:08.842 --> 00:11.279
[coughing]

00:11.312 --> 00:14.715
- I got her! Hey, if you can
move, move!

00:14.748 --> 00:16.584
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

00:16.617 --> 00:19.353
- Mrs. Wagner went in
for a second surgery,

00:19.387 --> 00:21.589
and it is still critical.

00:21.622 --> 00:24.425
Fire wasn't an accident.

00:24.458 --> 00:27.661
- I have successfully signed up
Firehouse 51

00:27.695 --> 00:30.564
for the Firefighter Muster!

00:30.598 --> 00:32.333
- This is just for a few weeks.

00:32.366 --> 00:35.769
Feel free to do whatever
you need to do.

00:35.803 --> 00:37.771
- I'm Hope, Sylvie's friend.

00:37.805 --> 00:40.474
I just wanted you to know
that you can text me anytime.

00:57.891 --> 01:00.594
[rock and roll music]

01:00.628 --> 01:07.668
*

01:12.206 --> 01:14.208
- See? I knew this roomie
situation

01:14.242 --> 01:16.110
was gonna work out
great.

01:16.144 --> 01:17.878
[sipping coffee]

01:17.911 --> 01:20.114
Cheers.

01:23.217 --> 01:25.486
- [chuckles]

01:29.157 --> 01:32.260
- [sighs]
Well, I didn't lie, right?

01:32.293 --> 01:34.128
Over Easy's the best breakfast
in Chicago.

01:34.162 --> 01:38.332
- Totally. I'm telling you,
I love every part of this city.

01:38.366 --> 01:40.601
Feels so good to get
out of Fowlerton.

01:40.634 --> 01:42.636
Even if it was just
for a little bit.

01:43.904 --> 01:46.207
- Is everything okay
back at home?

01:46.240 --> 01:52.213
- Yeah, it's fine. It's just
you know...Fowlerton.

01:52.246 --> 01:54.248
- Come on, you bum!
Move your tail!

01:54.282 --> 01:56.617
- Shift's starting!
[laughter]

01:56.650 --> 01:59.487
- Hey, Hope.

01:59.520 --> 02:01.355
- Hi, Otis!

02:01.389 --> 02:03.591
- I'm so sorry about
these buffoons!

02:03.624 --> 02:08.329
Thank you for the ride, and
I hope you enjoy Sears Tower.

02:08.362 --> 02:11.665
- Thanks. I will.

02:11.699 --> 02:14.768
- Really mature
behavior, as usual.

02:14.802 --> 02:18.406
- You guys jumped like a foot
out of your seats.

02:18.439 --> 02:20.641
- Yeah, any chance
you had with Hope is gone.

02:20.674 --> 02:22.510
- What? No, women love
that kind of stuff.

02:22.543 --> 02:23.511
- I'm a woman.

02:23.544 --> 02:25.579
- Mmm...not in those pants.

02:25.613 --> 02:28.649
[laughter]

02:28.682 --> 02:31.652
[melancholy music]

02:31.685 --> 02:38.726
*

02:40.694 --> 02:43.531
- Donna believes the fire was
intentionally set.

02:43.564 --> 02:45.566
- Did one of the students
see what happened?

02:45.599 --> 02:48.336
- No. Nobody was there
when it started.

02:48.369 --> 02:50.738
But after the fire, when
we were outside the school,

02:50.771 --> 02:55.543
the way the chem lab students
were whispering to each other--

02:55.576 --> 02:57.478
it's like they knew something.

02:57.511 --> 02:59.880
- Did you hear anything
specific? Any names?

02:59.913 --> 03:01.482
Anything?
- No.

03:01.515 --> 03:02.983
A lot of the faculty have
reached out.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.552
We brought in a counselor,

03:04.585 --> 03:06.354
but none of these students
will talk.

03:06.387 --> 03:08.422
- So you think
one of the students did this?

03:08.456 --> 03:12.960
- Yeah. I just don't
know which one,

03:12.993 --> 03:16.597
and if any of the others
saw it happen.

03:16.630 --> 03:19.700
Look, I know all of this sounds
really vague, but...

03:19.733 --> 03:21.835
- Donna's instincts with
the case are dead on.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.637
She says they're hiding
something, then they are.

03:23.671 --> 03:25.239
- What does OFI say?

03:25.273 --> 03:26.940
- They're still investigating
the scene.

03:26.974 --> 03:29.410
I just spoke with Lt. Hubble.
She says with all the chemicals

03:29.443 --> 03:31.379
stored in the lab,
and all the gas lines,

03:31.412 --> 03:33.447
they're just going to go
under the assumption that

03:33.481 --> 03:35.549
it was an accident, unless
we find evidence of arson.

03:35.583 --> 03:37.551
- Meanwhile, Jamie Wagner
is in the hospital

03:37.585 --> 03:39.320
with burns all over her body.

03:39.353 --> 03:40.654
- I'd like you two to go
to the school.

03:40.688 --> 03:43.324
Make sure OFI doesn't
miss anything.

03:43.357 --> 03:45.259
- Yeah, you got it, Chief.

03:45.293 --> 03:48.028
- Truck 81, Squad 3, Ambulance
61, motor vehicle accident

03:48.061 --> 03:49.463
on Lakeshore Drive
and Lincoln.

03:49.497 --> 03:52.366
- We'll do everything we can.

03:54.635 --> 03:57.638
[sirens blaring]

04:01.509 --> 04:04.378
[tires screeching]

04:06.747 --> 04:08.582
[brakes hiss]

04:12.786 --> 04:15.423
- Great, squad's here.

04:15.456 --> 04:18.559
C'mon, Severide, let us have
some fun once in a while.

04:18.592 --> 04:20.328
- You think I want to break
a sweat, Labedzki?

04:20.361 --> 04:22.863
Where's your lieutenant?
- Down below.

04:24.698 --> 04:28.502
- Hey, Wolanski! We got
Truck 81 and Squad 3 here.

04:28.536 --> 04:30.371
Just let us know
where you want us.

04:30.404 --> 04:32.573
- Okay, stand by. I'm gonna get
this driver stabilized--

04:32.606 --> 04:34.408
[snapping]

04:34.442 --> 04:36.009
- Get out of there!

04:36.043 --> 04:38.278
[screaming]

04:44.552 --> 04:45.386
- 81! We need some weight
on that back end!

04:48.889 --> 04:49.390
- Copy! -
And Cruz...

04:50.791 --> 04:51.959
let's grab some airbags.

04:51.992 --> 04:53.694
- Airbags! Copy!

04:57.465 --> 05:00.334
[all grunting]

05:01.735 --> 05:04.104
- Hey, Wolanski! Look at me!
How are you feeling?

05:04.137 --> 05:06.374
- Good, just pull me out.

05:06.407 --> 05:09.076
- Okay.
- Worth a try.

05:09.109 --> 05:12.413
[straining]

05:13.581 --> 05:16.450
- He's not moving.

05:17.585 --> 05:19.520
Let's hurry up
with those airbags!

05:19.553 --> 05:21.889
- [grunts] It's getting harder
to breathe!

05:21.922 --> 05:24.825
- I keep telling you, Wolanski.
Lay off the donuts!

05:24.858 --> 05:28.362
- Don't make me laugh.
I'll break a rib.

05:28.396 --> 05:29.530
[crunching]
- [screaming]

05:29.563 --> 05:31.131
What's happening over there?

05:31.164 --> 05:34.702
- Sorry, lieutenant! Get it
together, 81! What the hell?

05:34.735 --> 05:36.704
- Easy, Labedzki, it was
nobody's fault.

05:36.737 --> 05:39.373
- Yeah, right!
- Come on, Kidd!

05:42.710 --> 05:45.713
- Ready?
- Almost there!

05:48.549 --> 05:50.117
- Got it!
- All right.

05:50.150 --> 05:51.719
- Let me know
when you're ready, Cruz.

05:51.752 --> 05:52.853
- Good to go.

05:52.886 --> 05:55.823
- All right, up on one.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.891
[air hissing]

05:59.893 --> 06:01.562
All right, up on two!

06:01.595 --> 06:03.964
[air hissing]

06:03.997 --> 06:05.599
- All right, all right.

06:05.633 --> 06:08.168
- Okay, on three, pull. Ready?
- Yep.

06:08.201 --> 06:11.371
- One... two... three!

06:16.009 --> 06:17.745
- Dawson, Brett!

06:20.113 --> 06:21.715
- I'm okay.

06:21.749 --> 06:24.952
- Don't move. Don't move.
- I'm okay.

06:24.985 --> 06:26.520
- We gotta make sure.

06:26.554 --> 06:27.955
- No, I'm okay.
Don't worry about me.

06:27.988 --> 06:29.723
Take care of the driver.

06:29.757 --> 06:31.459
[grunts]

06:32.993 --> 06:34.862
[panting] Thank you.

06:34.895 --> 06:37.431
- He's stabilized.
- All yours, guys.

06:40.233 --> 06:43.437
- Watch his head.
- You got him?

06:53.046 --> 06:55.415
- You're welcome!

06:57.150 --> 07:01.889
Hey Mouch, how many people
of the Polish persuasion

07:01.922 --> 07:04.558
does it take to rescue
an injured motorist?

07:04.592 --> 07:06.059
- Are you funny now?
You a comedian?

07:06.093 --> 07:09.530
- Hey, relax, Labedzki.
I'm just checking your hearing.

07:09.563 --> 07:11.565
- Boy, you guys
from 51 really think

07:11.599 --> 07:13.000
you're God's gift,
don't you?

07:13.033 --> 07:15.569
- We bailed you out.
Be gracious about it.

07:15.603 --> 07:17.505
[all shouting at once]

07:17.538 --> 07:22.843
- Hey! Hey! Let's put all this
aggression where it belongs:

07:22.876 --> 07:27.648
on the field at the All-Chicago
Semi-Annual Firefighter Muster!

07:27.681 --> 07:30.584
- Are you kidding?
We'll knock you on your ass.

07:30.618 --> 07:33.687
- 1,000 bucks says otherwise.

07:33.721 --> 07:35.856
- Uh--
Wait--what? Mouch...

07:35.889 --> 07:37.124
- 100 bucks a man.

07:37.157 --> 07:39.226
- You're on.

07:39.259 --> 07:41.729
May the best house win.

07:48.536 --> 07:50.604
- You're welcome.

07:57.778 --> 07:59.913
- I'm gonna visit Jamie
after work.

07:59.947 --> 08:02.149
Doctor says she's still
having a hard time breathing.

08:02.182 --> 08:05.018
- Sorry to hear that.
- Yeah.

08:05.052 --> 08:07.020
I'll join you.

08:08.989 --> 08:11.224
How are you supposed to hold
class when most

08:11.258 --> 08:13.126
of the second floor is
destroyed?

08:13.160 --> 08:15.629
- Math and science are in
the cafeteria for a few months

08:15.663 --> 08:17.565
while they rebuild.

08:21.802 --> 08:25.673
Some of those kids were
in the chem lab.

08:25.706 --> 08:29.610
Maybe if I wasn't new here,
or had a smarter approach,

08:29.643 --> 08:30.978
they'd talk to me.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.013
- Ellie, you've done
all that you can.

08:33.046 --> 08:35.115
- Doesn't feel like it.

08:38.852 --> 08:42.956
Whoever started the fire is
still in there somewhere.

08:46.326 --> 08:48.862
- You still sure about that?

08:51.198 --> 08:53.066
- You may know
fires, Wallace,

08:53.100 --> 08:55.035
but I know kids.

08:55.068 --> 08:57.137
You have to trust me.

08:59.006 --> 09:00.040
- I do.

09:00.073 --> 09:03.043
[somber music]

09:03.076 --> 09:10.083
*

09:16.757 --> 09:17.057
.

09:17.090 --> 09:17.858
- I haven't told anyone
about this,

09:19.960 --> 09:25.132
not even Trudy, but when
my heart stopped,

09:25.165 --> 09:28.902
when I was going
into the light,

09:28.936 --> 09:30.838
I saw something.

09:30.871 --> 09:35.375
I saw that I was surrounded

09:35.408 --> 09:38.278
by all the people of 51.

09:38.311 --> 09:42.616
We were hand in hand,
helping each other ascend

09:42.650 --> 09:44.952
a grand staircase,

09:44.985 --> 09:49.823
which rose up
towards a golden chalice.

09:49.857 --> 09:53.861
Only now do I understand

09:53.894 --> 09:55.796
the meaning of this vision.

09:55.829 --> 10:01.101
We are going to win
the Firefighter Muster.

10:01.134 --> 10:04.237
- It's funny how you never
told us about this vision

10:04.271 --> 10:06.974
until after you backed us
into a $1,000 bet.

10:07.007 --> 10:12.913
- Mock all you want, friends,
but I know what I experienced.

10:12.946 --> 10:18.318
As your coach, I have assigned
each of you to an event

10:18.351 --> 10:22.856
to maximize our chances
of winning.

10:22.890 --> 10:25.759
- Mouch!
- Guys, come on.

10:27.728 --> 10:29.229
Mouch almost died.

10:29.262 --> 10:31.631
Are we really
going to deny him this?

10:33.100 --> 10:34.902
- Let's see the list.

10:34.935 --> 10:38.005
- How long are we gonna be
under this dead Mouch tyranny?

10:38.038 --> 10:39.840
- Can I see?

10:39.873 --> 10:42.876
Hey look! It's you and me
on ladder throw. Not bad.

10:42.910 --> 10:45.112
- Oh, hey, we're teamed up
for the hose stretch.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.947
- [scoffs]
We will slay that.

10:46.980 --> 10:51.151
Mmm. Hey, you want to meet up
at Severide's after shift?

10:51.184 --> 10:53.253
We could walk to that nearby
playground? Practice?

10:53.286 --> 10:55.756
- Severide's?
- Yeah, I live there now.

10:58.058 --> 11:00.828
- Up the grand staircase
we go, 51!

11:00.861 --> 11:02.229
[all shout]

11:02.262 --> 11:03.964
- Great work, buddy.
I can't wait to see

11:03.997 --> 11:05.332
what my
assignment is.

11:05.365 --> 11:08.435
- There you go.
- Mouch, this is awesome.

11:08.468 --> 11:11.238
I'm just wondering--you have me
on dummy drag?

11:11.271 --> 11:15.108
And in paramedic training,
we don't do dummy drags.

11:15.142 --> 11:16.844
- Don't sell yourself short.

11:16.877 --> 11:19.046
- Oh! Buddy, you got me
here on the pole hang,

11:19.079 --> 11:20.848
and it's just that's not
so good for me,

11:20.881 --> 11:23.984
'cause I still got that shoulder
thing, so maybe we could--

11:24.017 --> 11:26.019
- The bucket brigade is all
lunkheads.

11:26.053 --> 11:30.758
I'm not doing it this year.
- Do not question the vision!

11:32.760 --> 11:35.395
- [sighs]

11:35.428 --> 11:37.230
- [grumbles]

11:48.075 --> 11:50.878
- Hey, Van Meter.
- Hey, Severide.

11:50.911 --> 11:56.016
- Hey, this is Matthew Casey.
Mind if we have a look around?

11:56.049 --> 12:00.020
- Sure thing, just wrapping up.
You guys work this fire?

12:00.053 --> 12:02.990
- Yeah. Find the cause yet?

12:03.023 --> 12:07.027
- We can confirm it started
in the chemistry lab,

12:07.060 --> 12:08.962
but you knew that.

12:08.996 --> 12:10.497
Classroom was empty,

12:10.530 --> 12:12.933
sixth period chemistry
had just ended.

12:12.966 --> 12:16.236
Somebody smelled smoke
and the teacher ran back here,

12:16.269 --> 12:17.971
found a fire burning
on the counter.

12:18.005 --> 12:20.941
She tried to put it out,
but it burned hot and fast,

12:20.974 --> 12:24.111
fed by the various flammables
in the storage cabinet.

12:24.144 --> 12:25.412
She probably succumbed
right away,

12:25.445 --> 12:27.180
and the fire
continued to spread.

12:27.214 --> 12:28.882
- How did it start?

12:28.916 --> 12:30.884
- Chemicals on the counter.
Don't know what yet.

12:30.918 --> 12:32.552
We figured maybe
an experiment was left out,

12:32.585 --> 12:36.023
but then one of my guys
just spotted this.

12:36.056 --> 12:38.291
- Char line?

12:38.325 --> 12:40.060
- Somebody poured
a stream of accelerant

12:40.093 --> 12:41.995
leading right to the door.

12:42.029 --> 12:43.931
- So arson.

12:43.964 --> 12:47.400
- We'll be escalating this
to a criminal investigation.

12:49.236 --> 12:52.072
- [grunts]

12:52.105 --> 12:54.174
Donna was right.

12:56.343 --> 12:58.445
- Casey, isn't that where
we found the teacher?

12:58.478 --> 13:02.850
- Yep. Why?
What are you thinking?

13:13.026 --> 13:15.095
- Hey, Van Meter?
- What do we got?

13:15.128 --> 13:17.364
- These vinyl tiles are
pre-code.

13:17.397 --> 13:19.132
They should've been updated
years ago.

13:19.166 --> 13:21.368
Instead, they just slapped
a layer of polyurethane down

13:21.401 --> 13:24.137
to cover it up.
- Okay.

13:24.171 --> 13:26.339
- This is how we got
our victim out.

13:26.373 --> 13:30.477
In this direction,
down this path here.

13:30.510 --> 13:34.214
Something must have scraped
the polyurethane,

13:34.247 --> 13:37.951
Maybe a carabiner
on our webbing?

13:37.985 --> 13:40.587
- The fire burned the exposed
portion of the tiles,

13:40.620 --> 13:42.189
leaving that trail.

13:45.558 --> 13:47.394
- So this char line was formed

13:47.427 --> 13:49.396
after the fire was
already burning?

13:49.429 --> 13:52.132
- Definitely.
There was no accelerant here.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.434
- So, no arson.

14:01.674 --> 14:03.510
- No, you can't really blame
Van Meter.

14:03.543 --> 14:05.278
I mean, he had no way of
knowing

14:05.312 --> 14:07.580
that we carved that trail
he was looking at.

14:09.316 --> 14:11.118
- I'm confused.

14:11.151 --> 14:12.920
If it wasn't accelerant,

14:12.953 --> 14:14.387
how did the fire start?

14:14.421 --> 14:16.156
- It could've been improperly
stored chemicals.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.558
They had a lot of old, outdated
stuff in those cabinets.

14:18.591 --> 14:21.261
- Yeah, we just gotta get
the lab results.

14:21.294 --> 14:23.496
- Help me to understand this.

14:23.530 --> 14:27.034
I sent you there to help OFI
look for signs of arson,

14:27.067 --> 14:28.936
but instead you rule it out.

14:28.969 --> 14:30.904
- We didn't rule it out, Chief.
- No.

14:30.938 --> 14:32.572
Look, they were headed
down a blind alley

14:32.605 --> 14:34.574
with the whole char line.
We just set them straight.

14:34.607 --> 14:37.010
- We have a teacher
that may not survive.

14:37.044 --> 14:39.612
The police are not going to put
any resources into this thing

14:39.646 --> 14:43.050
until it escalates to a criminal
investigation, so please,

14:43.083 --> 14:46.186
go back there. You keep digging
until you find something

14:46.219 --> 14:48.455
that can make that happen.

14:48.488 --> 14:50.490
- What if Donna's
hunch is wrong?

14:53.593 --> 14:57.164
- All right. We'll take
another look, Chief.

14:57.197 --> 15:00.167
[tense music]

15:00.200 --> 15:07.374
*

15:20.087 --> 15:20.387
.

15:20.420 --> 15:21.288
- I mean, really what does
he want us to do?

15:22.990 --> 15:24.324
Cook up some evidence that
points to arson?

15:24.357 --> 15:25.592
- He just wants us to make sure

15:25.625 --> 15:27.327
nothing falls through the
cracks.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.029
- And if we can't find anything?
Then what?

15:29.062 --> 15:30.530
You're gonna be the one that
walks back in there

15:30.563 --> 15:32.432
and tells him?
- It's that bad, huh?

15:32.465 --> 15:34.334
- Boden's not thinking
clearly on this one.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.269
- I understand
where he's coming from.

15:36.303 --> 15:39.506
Donna could've died
in that fire.

15:39.539 --> 15:41.174
- What are we supposed to do?

15:41.208 --> 15:42.509
We already checked
the classroom.

15:42.542 --> 15:45.412
OFI is processing the samples.

15:47.414 --> 15:48.681
- Talk to the
chemistry students.

15:48.715 --> 15:50.150
- Donna can't get anything out
of them.

15:50.183 --> 15:51.985
Why would they talk to us?

15:52.019 --> 15:53.553
- Well, they've had a few days
for the shock to wear off,

15:53.586 --> 15:55.255
and the gravity to sink in.

15:55.288 --> 15:56.756
Anyway, people trust
firefighters.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.425
They open up to us.

16:00.693 --> 16:03.330
It's worth a try.

16:07.734 --> 16:12.272
- This is where we stuck
Mrs. Wagner's chemistry class.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.541
Mr. Royce, these are the
firefighters

16:14.574 --> 16:16.209
who rescued Mrs. Wagner.

16:16.243 --> 16:17.744
Is it okay if they have a word
with your kids?

16:17.777 --> 16:21.048
- Sure, of course.
- Great, thanks.

16:23.116 --> 16:25.652
How you guys holding up?

16:25.685 --> 16:29.556
I'm sure you've heard Mrs.
Wagner is in critical condition,

16:29.589 --> 16:32.092
but please keep thinking
good thoughts.

16:32.125 --> 16:34.027
I've seen people come back
from worse.

16:34.061 --> 16:37.030
- We're still trying to figure
out how the fire started.

16:37.064 --> 16:38.331
We're wondering if anyone

16:38.365 --> 16:39.699
noticed anything
that might help.

16:39.732 --> 16:44.171
Any little detail.
A Bunsen burner left on.

16:44.204 --> 16:48.075
A chemical spill on the counter.
Saw someone go into the lab.

16:48.108 --> 16:49.409
Anything.

16:49.442 --> 16:51.544
- Are you the one who
saved that girl?

16:51.578 --> 16:54.481
- No, I didn't save her.
You guys did that.

16:54.514 --> 16:57.550
- What's your name?
- Rashidi.

16:58.751 --> 17:01.188
I heard someone screaming,
so I ran in there.

17:01.221 --> 17:04.391
Her clothes were on fire.
I just tried to put 'em out.

17:04.424 --> 17:07.627
- How's she doing?
- She's all right.

17:07.660 --> 17:11.431
Second degree
burns on her legs, but...

17:11.464 --> 17:14.234
- It would've been a lot worse
if you weren't there to help.

17:14.267 --> 17:16.603
[pen tapping]

17:16.636 --> 17:18.305
- Hey, Keith Moon.

17:18.338 --> 17:20.807
[tapping continues]

17:20.840 --> 17:24.477
Where were you when
the fire broke out?

17:24.511 --> 17:26.346
- Period's over.

17:26.379 --> 17:29.282
- Come on, Mateo. How about
a little cooperation, huh?

17:29.316 --> 17:31.718
[bell rings]

17:43.696 --> 17:45.132
- Hey.

17:45.165 --> 17:47.167
Takes a lot of guts to run into
a fire

17:47.200 --> 17:50.137
when everyone else
is running the other way.

17:52.639 --> 17:55.442
What is it, Rashidi?

17:59.512 --> 18:03.516
- Uh...uh...nothing.

18:03.550 --> 18:05.652
Now I gotta get to trig.

18:09.489 --> 18:11.358
- Hey!

18:11.391 --> 18:14.394
[tense music]

18:14.427 --> 18:21.601
*

18:23.570 --> 18:27.140
- Hey, where did you find these
hoses? They look pretty new.

18:27.174 --> 18:31.178
- Yeah, I told Romero I needed
them for a class at the academy.

18:31.211 --> 18:34.281
- You slut! You know he has
a thing for you,

18:34.314 --> 18:36.149
and you totally took advantage.

18:36.183 --> 18:39.852
- He does not have a thing.
- Oh, don't play coy with me.

18:39.886 --> 18:42.822
- It's been way too long
since we hung out.

18:42.855 --> 18:48.895
- Ugh, I know, but at least
we get to work together.

18:48.928 --> 18:53.600
- Yeah, it's not the same.
We gotta try harder.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.302
Make an effort for some girl
time, you know?

18:55.335 --> 18:56.703
- Yeah.

18:56.736 --> 18:58.571
- I didn't even know
you moved in with Severide.

18:58.605 --> 19:01.208
- It's no big deal.
It was a last minute thing.

19:01.241 --> 19:03.810
He kind of swooped in
and saved the day.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.778
- Are you sure
that's a good idea?

19:05.812 --> 19:08.581
- Look, I'm not hung up
on him at all,

19:08.615 --> 19:10.383
if that's what
you're getting at.

19:10.417 --> 19:13.253
- Okay.

19:13.286 --> 19:15.688
Come on, let's see what you got.
- All right.

19:16.556 --> 19:18.325
- Rashidi was gonna say
something,

19:18.358 --> 19:21.728
but one look from Mateo,
and he just clammed up tight.

19:21.761 --> 19:24.464
- Yeah, he's intimidated
for sure.

19:24.497 --> 19:26.333
- What's the deal
with this Mateo kid?

19:26.366 --> 19:29.202
- Mateo Cabrera, repeated
9th and 11th grades.

19:29.236 --> 19:32.405
Always in trouble. You know,
fist fights, bullying.

19:32.439 --> 19:35.208
Last year, he was suspended for
starting fires in a trash can

19:35.242 --> 19:36.776
on school grounds.

19:36.809 --> 19:38.845
- Anybody know where Mateo was
when it all went down?

19:38.878 --> 19:40.947
- I pulled his schedule.
He had a free period

19:40.980 --> 19:43.516
right after chem lab.
Could've been anywhere.

19:43.550 --> 19:47.220
I also found out he was one of
four assigned to the lab table

19:47.254 --> 19:48.755
where the fire started.

19:48.788 --> 19:50.923
- Hard to argue with that.
- So what happens now?

19:50.957 --> 19:53.960
- I'll try and talk to Mateo.
See if he's got an alibi.

19:53.993 --> 19:55.995
- Talk to him? No,
you've got to lock him up.

19:56.028 --> 19:58.398
- Donna.
- We don't have forensics yet

19:58.431 --> 19:59.766
that makes this an arson.

19:59.799 --> 20:01.801
You can't charge somebody
without a crime.

20:01.834 --> 20:03.770
- The other students could've
been killed by this kid,

20:03.803 --> 20:05.372
and now they've got to sit next
to him in class?

20:05.405 --> 20:07.740
No, that's crazy.
- Mrs. Boden, I'm with you.

20:07.774 --> 20:09.609
I will do what I can.

20:09.642 --> 20:11.711
- You get a confession out of
him, you don't need forensics.

20:11.744 --> 20:14.514
- Okay, let's manage
our expectations.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.516
I gotta get him to talk
to me first.

20:16.549 --> 20:20.587
One step at a time.
- Okay.

20:20.620 --> 20:23.523
Thanks for coming by.

20:23.556 --> 20:25.692
I'll get this.

20:26.893 --> 20:30.597
Thanks.
- Chief? Ah, you're all here.

20:30.630 --> 20:32.432
Sirs, I just wanted to make sure

20:32.465 --> 20:34.767
we can count on you all
for the Muster tug-of-war.

20:34.801 --> 20:36.403
It's kind of the big finale--
- Mouch.

20:36.436 --> 20:37.937
- Yeah, Chief.
- I'm not putting my back out

20:37.970 --> 20:39.906
because you made a bet with 87.

20:39.939 --> 20:42.309
- Oh, okay.

20:46.045 --> 20:47.347
- Hey!

20:49.015 --> 20:51.951
- Hey!
- What is this thing?

20:51.984 --> 20:56.289
- Dummy drag practice. I know
I can get better at this.

20:56.323 --> 20:59.559
It's all in the lift.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.661
[grunting]

21:01.694 --> 21:03.763
- [laughing]

21:03.796 --> 21:06.566
- Hey, Brett! We told you to
stop getting grabby

21:06.599 --> 21:08.000
with the guys around
the firehouse!

21:08.034 --> 21:10.303
- I've carried plenty of victims
twice that size

21:10.337 --> 21:11.971
on the stair chair.

21:12.004 --> 21:14.774
- Hey, forget two hands, okay?
Grab the dummy with one hand,

21:14.807 --> 21:16.443
by the wrist, and you get
running!

21:16.476 --> 21:17.977
It's good forward momentum.

21:18.010 --> 21:20.547
- No way. Two arms, backwards.
You just, you know start

21:20.580 --> 21:22.649
with a good thrust, you get
going, and then use your own

21:22.682 --> 21:25.585
weight to keep the momentum
moving. Okay?

21:25.618 --> 21:27.454
- Okay.
- You're gonna do great!

21:27.487 --> 21:30.022
All right?
Just takes some practice.

21:31.057 --> 21:33.025
- You're really lucky,
you know that?

21:33.059 --> 21:35.562
To be part of
such a close-knit group.

21:35.595 --> 21:37.630
It's like a family.

21:37.664 --> 21:40.433
- Yeah, it is.
For better or worse, trust me.

21:40.467 --> 21:42.335
[grunts]

21:42.369 --> 21:43.836
- I'm gonna grab some water
in the kitchen

21:43.870 --> 21:46.806
'cause you need it!
- Thanks, Hope.

21:48.074 --> 21:49.842
[straining]

21:56.082 --> 21:57.650
- Hey there.

21:58.551 --> 22:00.887
- Hey, you're still in Chicago.

22:00.920 --> 22:02.722
- For another week or so.

22:02.755 --> 22:05.825
Don't forget you made a promise
we would hang out before I left.

22:05.858 --> 22:08.027
- That's not the kind of thing
that slips my mind.

22:08.060 --> 22:09.762
- Good.

22:10.930 --> 22:12.699
[laughs]

22:14.033 --> 22:18.705
- That girl has been hanging out
at the firehouse a lot lately.

22:21.408 --> 22:23.075
What?

22:23.109 --> 22:24.511
What? Am I wrong?

22:24.544 --> 22:26.413
- No comment.
[chime]

22:26.446 --> 22:30.650
- Ambulance 61, person down.
8133 71st Street.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.118
- Oh, hey, Hope!
I gotta go on a run,

22:32.151 --> 22:34.020
but feel free to hang out.
I'll be right back.

22:34.053 --> 22:36.556
- Will do.
- Okay.

22:36.589 --> 22:40.092
[suspenseful music]

22:40.126 --> 22:43.463
*

22:43.496 --> 22:46.433
[sirens blaring]

22:50.136 --> 22:52.439
- I'm the one who called. I was
on my way to the rec center,

22:52.472 --> 22:55.374
and I saw him on the ground.
He's taken a beating.

22:59.646 --> 23:01.414
- I can't move my arm.

23:01.448 --> 23:04.116
- Brett, isn't this the kid
from the school fire?

23:07.219 --> 23:08.921
- [shuddering breath]

23:16.195 --> 23:16.563
.

23:16.596 --> 23:16.863
- [grunts]

23:18.565 --> 23:20.600
- I remember you from
the school. What's your name?

23:20.633 --> 23:22.001
- My arm, man, it hurts.

23:22.034 --> 23:23.503
- His name is Rashidi.
Rashidi Taylor.

23:23.536 --> 23:25.638
He's a lifeguard here
on the weekends.

23:25.672 --> 23:27.039
- All right, Rashidi.
You're gonna be okay.

23:27.073 --> 23:28.475
We're gonna give you some
morphine,

23:28.508 --> 23:29.609
it's gonna help with
the pain.

23:29.642 --> 23:31.143
- Who did this to you?

23:31.177 --> 23:34.947
- I don't know. Some kids...
Maybe a group of them.

23:34.981 --> 23:38.150
No one I know, definitely. I've
never seen any of them before.

23:44.624 --> 23:46.759
- Oh, my God.
- Hang in there, Rashidi.

23:46.793 --> 23:48.027
She's gonna give you
some morphine,

23:48.060 --> 23:50.630
and that'll kick in
in a little bit.

23:50.663 --> 23:52.965
- [grunts]

23:52.999 --> 23:54.734
- I'll call your mom, Rashidi.

23:59.171 --> 24:01.708
- We're gonna get you
to climb up there, okay?

24:04.511 --> 24:05.545
Okay.

24:06.679 --> 24:09.682
- He knows who attacked him.
He just didn't want to say.

24:15.755 --> 24:18.958
[sirens blaring]

24:23.830 --> 24:25.798
- Wallace!
- Donna.

24:25.832 --> 24:28.200
- How did this happen?

24:28.234 --> 24:30.069
How does a thing like this
happen?

24:30.102 --> 24:32.939
- It's a dislocated elbow.
Rashidi's gonna be fine.

24:32.972 --> 24:35.542
But he's denying
that it's Mateo.

24:35.575 --> 24:37.544
- And you two didn't even
believe me about the fire.

24:37.577 --> 24:39.211
- We just heard.
I'm sorry this happened.

24:39.245 --> 24:42.081
- Did you hear about
Jamie Wagner?

24:42.114 --> 24:44.517
They just put her into
a medically induced coma.

24:44.551 --> 24:46.553
Something about having to
protect lungs or something--

24:46.586 --> 24:50.222
I don't know!
It doesn't look good.

24:50.256 --> 24:52.925
- When is Hubble getting
those lab results?

24:52.959 --> 24:54.961
- You want to call OFI again?

24:54.994 --> 24:57.263
- I can do more than that.

25:02.969 --> 25:05.104
- Ready, and go!

25:05.137 --> 25:07.707
- Go.
- Set!

25:09.241 --> 25:11.711
- Raise it up!
Ahh!

25:14.280 --> 25:15.848
- Set it down!
- Yep!

25:15.882 --> 25:17.183
Lay it in!

25:17.216 --> 25:19.886
Go! Go, go, go, go!

25:19.919 --> 25:21.854
- You got this! Move it!
- Come on, come on, come on!

25:21.888 --> 25:23.289
[rings bell]

25:23.322 --> 25:25.291
- Oh! 12 seconds!
- Yeah!

25:25.324 --> 25:27.259
- Best time since
Spider Ferguson and his brother

25:27.293 --> 25:29.228
did 10 flat in '07!

25:29.261 --> 25:33.099
And I think
they were on the juice.

25:33.132 --> 25:35.802
How's that pole hang going,
Cruz?

25:35.835 --> 25:39.606
- Not great, but okay.

25:41.273 --> 25:43.810
- I'll be on the radio!

25:46.679 --> 25:49.248
- [straining]

25:49.281 --> 25:52.318
- Whoa.
- [panting]

25:52.351 --> 25:56.188
- I hate this dumb dummy.

25:56.222 --> 25:58.791
He is so unmanageable.

25:58.825 --> 26:02.294
- Yeah, it sucks when they won't
just do what you want them to.

26:02.328 --> 26:07.133
Okay, let's get this guy
back in the closet

26:07.166 --> 26:08.868
where he belongs.

26:12.905 --> 26:16.042
Your friend Hope has been
visiting the firehouse a lot.

26:16.075 --> 26:18.344
- Yeah, yeah.
She really likes it here.

26:18.377 --> 26:22.148
I think she might be dealing
with something back at home.

26:22.181 --> 26:24.050
- What kind of thing?

26:24.083 --> 26:25.952
- I don't know.

26:25.985 --> 26:29.055
She won't tell me,
which is weird,

26:29.088 --> 26:32.892
because growing up,
we shared everything.

26:32.925 --> 26:35.294
- People change.

26:35.327 --> 26:37.830
I mean you don't notice so much
when you're around them,

26:37.864 --> 26:41.367
but spend some time apart...

26:43.202 --> 26:46.906
- Whoa. You look as beat up
as I feel.

26:46.939 --> 26:48.841
- Muster-itis.

26:50.109 --> 26:52.879
- I'm headed to the app floor.
I'll take your dummy.

26:59.952 --> 27:02.221
[door thuds]

27:02.254 --> 27:05.324
[indistinct chatter]

27:13.199 --> 27:16.268
[bell rings]

27:25.244 --> 27:27.146
- Hey, Mateo.

27:29.415 --> 27:32.318
Hey, I hear you like
intimidating people.

27:32.351 --> 27:34.420
- Get the hell
away from me, man.

27:34.453 --> 27:37.857
- You beat up Rashidi,
and we know why.

27:37.890 --> 27:40.292
He knows you lit that fire.

27:43.295 --> 27:45.264
- You sound like you got it
all figured out.

27:45.297 --> 27:47.967
- Oh, I do.
- So what you want from me?

27:48.000 --> 27:50.937
- I want you to admit it.

27:50.970 --> 27:55.875
- Okay, sure. I dropped
Rashidi's punk ass,

27:55.908 --> 27:59.946
and I chucked a match
in the chem lab. So what?

27:59.979 --> 28:02.281
- So what?

28:02.314 --> 28:04.450
Your teacher could die.

28:04.483 --> 28:06.786
- That's not my problem, man.

28:08.420 --> 28:12.158
- Huh?
- That's all you got, man?

28:12.191 --> 28:14.026
Get off of me!
- Huh?

28:14.060 --> 28:15.862
- Get off!

28:15.895 --> 28:18.831
[tense music]

28:18.865 --> 28:25.304
*

28:25.337 --> 28:28.407
[printer whirring]

28:33.412 --> 28:37.316
- Lab results are in.
Where've you been?

28:38.384 --> 28:40.386
- Went to the high school.

28:45.191 --> 28:46.959
- What did you do?

28:49.228 --> 28:53.099
- Got Mateo to confess.
- You're kidding.

28:53.132 --> 28:55.902
- Did you tell CPD or OFI?

28:57.403 --> 29:01.473
I'm calling Hubbell.
- No, hold up, Chief. I...

29:01.507 --> 29:05.244
I don't--I don't think
he did it.

29:06.846 --> 29:09.181
He said he threw a match,
but wasn't it a chemical fire?

29:09.215 --> 29:11.851
- Yeah, they tested the residue.

29:11.884 --> 29:15.454
Calcium hypochlorite,
and polyethylene glycol.

29:18.557 --> 29:20.526
- That's two chemicals
that ignite on contact.

29:20.559 --> 29:22.494
Why the hell is he talking
about lighting a match?

29:22.528 --> 29:24.096
- I don't know, but why would
he confess

29:24.130 --> 29:25.798
to a crime he didn't
commit?

29:31.470 --> 29:34.206
- This kid is damaged.

29:34.240 --> 29:37.276
The hell knows
what makes him tick.

29:37.309 --> 29:40.512
- We don't even know
if it is a crime yet.

29:44.150 --> 29:46.018
Let's dig in.

29:48.287 --> 29:50.056
Come on.

29:57.429 --> 29:58.865
- What's all this?

29:58.898 --> 30:01.467
- OFI report on the school fire.

30:01.500 --> 30:03.202
- They calling it arson?

30:03.235 --> 30:06.472
- Just the lab results,
not a final determination.

30:06.505 --> 30:10.142
- Yeah, but we know it's arson.
- How?

30:10.176 --> 30:12.411
- The fire was started with
chlorine and brake fluid.

30:12.444 --> 30:14.280
Any kid with access
to YouTube knows

30:14.313 --> 30:16.315
that that's a mixture
that blows up.

30:16.348 --> 30:17.850
- Still, those chemicals could
have come

30:17.884 --> 30:19.886
into contact
accidentally.

30:19.919 --> 30:22.288
- What's brake fluid doing
in a high school chemistry lab?

30:22.321 --> 30:24.156
- You mean polyethylene glycol?

30:24.190 --> 30:27.026
Says here it has a lot
of laboratory uses.

30:27.059 --> 30:28.360
- Chlorine is pretty common.

30:28.394 --> 30:30.062
- Yeah, but it's not
pure chlorine.

30:30.096 --> 30:34.466
It's calcium hypochlorite,
that's pool chlorine.

30:35.634 --> 30:38.370
- Like as in swimming pools?

30:38.404 --> 30:40.973
- Yeah.

30:41.007 --> 30:42.909
- Huh.

30:42.942 --> 30:45.978
[dramatic music]

30:54.520 --> 30:55.021
.

30:55.054 --> 30:58.057
[woman speaks indistinctly
over PA]

31:02.228 --> 31:05.531
[suspenseful music]

31:05.564 --> 31:12.972
*

31:21.948 --> 31:23.615
- This wasn't supposed to
happen, was it?

31:23.649 --> 31:25.517
- What?

31:26.618 --> 31:29.055
- One of the chemicals that
started the fire

31:29.088 --> 31:30.556
was pool chlorine,

31:30.589 --> 31:33.525
which you have access to
at your lifeguard job.

31:33.559 --> 31:40.599
*

31:47.139 --> 31:49.608
- It wasn't supposed
to get so big.

31:56.382 --> 32:00.486
I wanted a small fire
at Mateo's lab table.

32:04.023 --> 32:08.060
He's lit one before, so maybe
they kick him out of the school,

32:08.094 --> 32:11.030
and he couldn't push me around
anymore.

32:18.170 --> 32:20.172
It just exploded.

32:25.211 --> 32:27.213
[cries]
I didn't know what to do.

32:27.246 --> 32:29.581
I-I tried to get everyone
out of there.

32:33.519 --> 32:38.057
I wanted to tell you
in the cafeteria, but...

32:39.458 --> 32:42.294
- Mateo thought you were trying
to blame it on him.

32:49.435 --> 32:52.071
- [cries]

32:57.743 --> 33:00.779
[sobs]

33:00.812 --> 33:03.782
[mournful music]

33:03.815 --> 33:11.223
*

33:24.736 --> 33:28.140
- I was so quick to make
assumptions about Mateo.

33:30.242 --> 33:31.610
- I can understand why.

33:31.643 --> 33:33.579
- If you hadn't insisted
this was arson,

33:33.612 --> 33:35.514
we might've missed
it altogether.

33:46.525 --> 33:49.528
- That could've been Donna
in that room.

33:52.331 --> 33:55.534
Look, if I was...

33:55.567 --> 33:57.469
too bull-headed,

33:57.503 --> 33:59.638
not rational enough, then I'm--

33:59.671 --> 34:01.540
- We get it, Chief.

34:01.573 --> 34:04.543
- You did good.

34:04.576 --> 34:11.617
*

34:13.552 --> 34:15.654
- Didn't think I'd enjoy
the Muster this much.

34:15.687 --> 34:18.124
- Yeah, winning is fun.

34:18.157 --> 34:20.292
[both laugh]

34:20.326 --> 34:23.429
[cheers and applause]

34:27.666 --> 34:30.402
- Yeah, that's right.
Keep walking, McDowell.

34:30.436 --> 34:33.372
- You gloating, Kidd? You only
beat us by half a step.

34:33.405 --> 34:35.541
- Listen, I'll tell you what.

34:35.574 --> 34:37.643
Come to Molly's tonight,
I'll buy you a beer.

34:37.676 --> 34:41.147
You know, help dull the pain.
- You're paying, I'll be there.

34:41.180 --> 34:42.581
- Okay.

34:43.849 --> 34:45.651
[both laugh]

34:45.684 --> 34:50.222
- See? I am a single, fun-loving
woman who can go out

34:50.256 --> 34:53.159
and sex up Chicago all I want.

34:53.192 --> 34:55.261
I'm not hung up on Severide
at all.

34:55.294 --> 34:57.229
- You know if you keep
saying that, it means

34:57.263 --> 34:59.298
you're hung up on
him, right?

35:02.401 --> 35:05.471
[cheering and applause]

35:11.443 --> 35:14.546
- Hey, what do you got
for us, Cruz?

35:14.580 --> 35:16.282
- I got second place
in the dummy drag.

35:16.315 --> 35:17.583
- Good job.

35:17.616 --> 35:20.452
- Better than third, I guess.

35:20.486 --> 35:22.421
- Mouch, I tried.
It's worth three points.

35:22.454 --> 35:25.724
- Whoa, dummy drag?
I had you on pole hang!

35:25.757 --> 35:29.861
- Mouch, I don't want to do
what you say anymore.

35:29.895 --> 35:31.663
- Finally.

35:33.632 --> 35:37.703
- [panting]
Look, Mouch, I love you,

35:37.736 --> 35:41.440
and I'm sorry that you
almost died because of me,

35:41.473 --> 35:43.209
but I can't keep this up.

35:43.242 --> 35:47.613
I can't keep doing everything
you say all of the time.

35:47.646 --> 35:50.516
[panting]

35:51.750 --> 35:56.355
- Three points. That leaves us
12 points behind 87.

35:56.388 --> 35:58.757
- Ugh, tug-of-war's
only worth 10!

35:58.790 --> 36:03.595
- So if nobody's doing the pole
hang, that's it! 1,000 bucks!

36:03.629 --> 36:07.199
- Look, Mouch. I didn't say
no one was doing the pole hang.

36:07.233 --> 36:10.302
I just said I wasn't.
- Huh?

36:12.671 --> 36:14.640
- [straining]

36:14.673 --> 36:16.642
- Oh yeah!

36:16.675 --> 36:17.976
- Okay.

36:18.009 --> 36:19.645
- Brett!

36:19.678 --> 36:21.480
Brett!
- Yeah, Brett!

36:21.513 --> 36:23.715
- Hang in there, Brett!
- Come on! Hang in there!

36:23.749 --> 36:26.418
- Happy thoughts!
You got this!

36:26.452 --> 36:28.854
- This big guy's got nothing!
- He's sliding down!

36:28.887 --> 36:31.390
[all shouting encouragement]

36:31.423 --> 36:34.560
[cheers and applause]

36:36.462 --> 36:38.930
[straining]

36:38.964 --> 36:40.766
- He's slipping, you're good!

36:40.799 --> 36:44.803
Hang on!
- Go for the world record!

36:44.836 --> 36:47.873
[cheers and applause]

36:50.041 --> 36:52.278
- Are you kidding me?

36:52.311 --> 36:55.347
Oh, my God! Oh God!

36:55.381 --> 36:58.484
- Four more points
we can still beat 87!

36:58.517 --> 37:00.819
- Firehouses 51 and 87

37:00.852 --> 37:02.954
please report
to the tug-of-war arena.

37:02.988 --> 37:05.424
- This is it! All the marbles!

37:05.457 --> 37:07.693
- Get done!
- Just go big!

37:07.726 --> 37:09.428
- Come on!

37:09.461 --> 37:12.531
[cheers and applause]

37:13.965 --> 37:18.404
- Oh, bad news, Mouch!

37:21.340 --> 37:23.442
- Nazarko?
- Our secret weapon.

37:23.475 --> 37:26.278
- No, no, no, no.
He's not active duty.

37:26.312 --> 37:29.648
He just had his stomach stapled!
- He's back at work next shift.

37:29.681 --> 37:32.684
The doc signed off.
Deal with it.

37:32.718 --> 37:36.455
- We're done for.
- 'Scuse me.

37:36.488 --> 37:38.324
- Hey! Not so fast!

37:38.357 --> 37:42.494
- Yeah!
- It is on now!

37:42.528 --> 37:46.031
[all cheering and shouting]

37:46.064 --> 37:48.066
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

37:48.099 --> 37:49.801
- What are we waiting for?

37:49.835 --> 37:52.471
- Yeah! Yes!

37:52.504 --> 37:54.005
[whistle blows]

37:54.039 --> 37:56.808
[cheering and straining]

- Come on 51!
- Dig! Come on, dig!

38:01.079 --> 38:02.848
- Come on!

38:04.783 --> 38:06.418
Come on, 51!

38:08.086 --> 38:10.556
[all straining]

38:23.669 --> 38:28.039
[knocking on door]

38:28.073 --> 38:32.578
- Hey, hey, hey.
You're off the hook.

38:34.713 --> 38:38.484
Listen, I know what it's like
when everybody

38:38.517 --> 38:41.520
already has their mind made up
about you.

38:42.921 --> 38:46.858
Sometimes it's easier just
to let them think the worst.

38:50.095 --> 38:53.399
It doesn't have to be
like that.

38:53.432 --> 38:56.468
You decide who you are.
Not them.

38:58.737 --> 39:00.639
But you can't go around
beating people up

39:00.672 --> 39:02.874
every time you feel
disrespected.

39:02.908 --> 39:06.445
It'll take you down a dark road.
Trust me.

39:17.756 --> 39:20.626
You got a second chance here,
Mateo.

39:22.461 --> 39:24.696
Don't blow it.

39:36.542 --> 39:38.009
- Yo!

39:40.479 --> 39:42.648
The teacher.

39:42.681 --> 39:44.916
Is she gonna make it?

39:46.652 --> 39:48.787
- Things are looking up.
