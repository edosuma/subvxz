WEBVTT

00:13.247 --> 00:15.283
Thom:
This is a mother ship,

00:15.316 --> 00:17.085
just like the mother ship
that left me

00:17.118 --> 00:19.820
on this ridiculous planet
40-something years ago.

00:19.853 --> 00:22.156
I honestly can't think
of another explanation

00:22.190 --> 00:23.157
of what I'm doing here.

00:23.191 --> 00:24.758
I clearly don't belong.

00:24.792 --> 00:26.494
I've tried to get along,
I've tried to fit in.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.496
I got a designer shirt
and trendy running shoes,

00:28.529 --> 00:30.231
but it's not helping.

00:30.264 --> 00:32.100
It's been four decades,
mother ship.

00:32.133 --> 00:33.367
I've done my time.

00:33.401 --> 00:34.835
So, wherever you are,
turn around,

00:34.868 --> 00:39.107
come back, and get me
the fuck out of here!

00:39.140 --> 00:42.243
* If you're happy
and you know it,
clap your hands *

00:42.276 --> 00:44.778
* If you're happy and you
know it, clap your hands *

00:44.812 --> 00:47.781
* If you're
happy and you know it,
then motherfucking show it *

00:47.815 --> 00:50.584
* If you're happy
and you know it, clap your
motherfucking hands *

00:50.618 --> 00:54.588
* If you're happy
and you know it,
clap your hands! *

00:54.622 --> 00:56.457
Thom:
It began as a joke.

00:56.490 --> 00:59.460
Lee:
And that fucking school
doesn't do shit.

00:59.493 --> 01:01.129
Did you paint today?

01:01.162 --> 01:02.396
How, Thom? When?

01:02.430 --> 01:03.731
I had Jules with me
all afternoon,

01:03.764 --> 01:06.200
because Fitzgerald Miller
is a bully.

01:06.234 --> 01:07.535
You should paint.

01:07.568 --> 01:09.137
You know what you're like
when you don't work.

01:09.170 --> 01:10.804
"Scream when you burn."

01:10.838 --> 01:12.606
Bukowski said that.

01:12.640 --> 01:14.275
Well, it's easy
for him to say.

01:14.308 --> 01:16.610
When a man screams,
he's a genius.

01:16.644 --> 01:19.280
When a woman screams,
she's just a cunt.

01:19.313 --> 01:22.150
I need to get a studio
of my own, Thom.

01:22.183 --> 01:24.285
I need a room
without a view.

01:24.318 --> 01:26.687
- He's gonna do well.
- Bukowski?

01:26.720 --> 01:29.623
- No, Fitzgerald.
- You mean in life?

01:29.657 --> 01:32.426
Yeah, 'cause, you know--
'cause he's an asshole.

01:32.460 --> 01:35.763
In this toilet of a world,
the asshole is king.

01:35.796 --> 01:37.898
Well, wouldn't shit
be king in a toilet?

01:37.931 --> 01:40.834
No, honey,
'cause the shit's gotta
come from somewhere.

01:40.868 --> 01:42.170
( laughing )

01:42.203 --> 01:45.173
Great big asshole
in the sky.

01:45.206 --> 01:46.840
I wonder
when it's coming back.

01:46.874 --> 01:48.576
What, darling?

01:48.609 --> 01:50.178
- The mother ship.
- ( laughs )

01:50.211 --> 01:52.846
To take us back to whatever
fucking planet we belong on.

01:52.880 --> 01:55.183
- That's very optimistic.
- What is?

01:55.216 --> 01:57.718
That there's a fucking planet
that we belong on.

01:57.751 --> 02:00.388
We're down here.
We're down here!

02:00.421 --> 02:01.855
Please,
we're right here!

02:01.889 --> 02:03.857
- Come and get us!
- Please, help us.

02:03.891 --> 02:06.594
- Take us back.
Please. Please!
- Please come and get us!

02:06.627 --> 02:08.396
- Please!
- You abandoned us!

02:08.429 --> 02:12.200
* I'd like to sing
the world a song *

02:12.233 --> 02:15.603
* Of happiness and love

02:15.636 --> 02:19.407
* Of puppies, joy,
and unicorns *

02:19.440 --> 02:22.810
* We always
have dreamed of *

02:22.843 --> 02:26.547
* I'd like to get
the world to sing *

02:26.580 --> 02:30.484
- * In certain harmony
- * Certain harmony

02:30.518 --> 02:33.954
* I'd like to give
the world a Coke *

02:33.987 --> 02:37.825
- * And drink it cheerfully
- * That's the main thing

02:37.858 --> 02:41.429
* I'd like to get
the world to si-- *

02:41.462 --> 02:44.232
So let's talk about this.

02:44.265 --> 02:45.899
I love that.

02:45.933 --> 02:47.501
Is that gonna be
a real commercial?

02:47.535 --> 02:49.503
It is a real commercial.
1976.

02:49.537 --> 02:51.372
That's awesome.

02:51.405 --> 02:54.442
Do you think
we're too cynical today
for a message like this?

02:54.475 --> 02:56.777
No. I mean, maybe,
like, old people are.

02:56.810 --> 02:58.246
Like in their 40s
or something.

02:58.279 --> 02:59.580
Millennials.

02:59.613 --> 03:01.782
Stupid fucking
optimistic assholes.

03:01.815 --> 03:05.386
Oh, it's not millennials,
Thom, it's nature.

03:05.419 --> 03:06.654
We're all assholes.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.922
Everyone who is or was
is an asshole.

03:08.956 --> 03:12.793
- What, even Gandhi?
- Think about it.

03:12.826 --> 03:14.795
We all start out
the same way--

03:14.828 --> 03:17.798
a single sperm among
50 million other sperm,

03:17.831 --> 03:20.934
all desperate
to get to one egg.

03:20.968 --> 03:22.670
To win.

03:22.703 --> 03:25.939
You, me, everyone else
on the planet ever
in history,

03:25.973 --> 03:28.876
we all won that 100-meter
in-utero, winner-take-all

03:28.909 --> 03:32.613
race to mama's enchanted,
life-giving egg.

03:32.646 --> 03:35.283
- First prize?
- Life?

03:35.316 --> 03:37.885
- Second prize?
- Death.

03:37.918 --> 03:41.289
Right.
Now, you think we weren't
throwing a few elbows?

03:41.322 --> 03:44.825
You think you weren't knocking
a few other sperm over,

03:44.858 --> 03:47.961
stabbing 'em in the back
just to get ahead,
just to win?

03:47.995 --> 03:51.832
Thom, you don't win
that kind of race

03:51.865 --> 03:53.567
without being an asshole.

03:53.601 --> 03:55.969
I mean,
a huge asshole.

03:56.003 --> 03:58.772
Your problem is
you think that assholes

03:58.806 --> 04:02.510
are some sort of anomaly,
some sort of aberration.

04:02.543 --> 04:06.580
Nature is
an asshole factory,
my friend.

04:06.614 --> 04:09.450
If you exist,
you're an asshole.

04:09.483 --> 04:10.784
You think,
therefore you are,

04:10.818 --> 04:13.387
but you are,
therefore you're an asshole.

04:13.421 --> 04:16.590
- * I'd like to get
the world to sing... *
- What's going on?

04:16.624 --> 04:18.459
* A certain harmony...

04:18.492 --> 04:19.993
Thom's voice:
It's not just the assholes,
though.

04:20.027 --> 04:23.731
It's that everyone
loves assholes.

04:23.764 --> 04:27.868
Like this asshole,
Fitzgerald Miller.

04:27.901 --> 04:30.604
You smell that?
That is sulfur, folks.

04:30.638 --> 04:34.542
Brimstone.
The kid is pure,
malevolent evil.

04:34.575 --> 04:37.545
And everybody
at Woodstock Day School

04:37.578 --> 04:39.747
loves this little shitheel.

04:39.780 --> 04:45.686
- ( keyboard playing )
- * Don't worry about a thing

04:45.719 --> 04:47.888
* 'Cause every
little thing *

04:47.921 --> 04:51.392
- ( cameras clicking )
- * Is gonna be all right

04:52.793 --> 04:58.699
* Don't worry
about a thing *

04:58.732 --> 05:01.502
* 'Cause every
little thing *

05:01.535 --> 05:03.804
* Is gonna be
all right. *

05:09.943 --> 05:12.680
- ( song ends )
- ( applause )

05:17.084 --> 05:21.522
Somehow, between being
our star basketball player

05:21.555 --> 05:24.057
and lead actor
in our holiday play,

05:24.091 --> 05:28.028
Fitzgerald found time
to master the keyboard.

05:35.569 --> 05:37.738
Thom:
It doesn't matter
what Fitzgerald said, buddy.

05:37.771 --> 05:42.075
- He said I was a bad singer.
- Really? Oh.

05:42.109 --> 05:45.679
Oh, he's just jealous
of you, buddy.

05:45.713 --> 05:47.881
And he never
picks me for teams,

05:47.915 --> 05:50.684
and he says my clothes
are stupid.

05:50.718 --> 05:52.085
( sighs )

05:52.119 --> 05:54.888
Okay, you know something?
I'm gonna tell you something.

05:54.922 --> 05:56.957
I'm gonna use
a word now,
all right?

05:56.990 --> 05:59.560
And it's a bad word,
but I think you should know it,

05:59.593 --> 06:00.694
and I think
it's appropriate.

06:00.728 --> 06:02.563
And that word is "asshole."

06:02.596 --> 06:04.632
I'm sorry, but that's
what Fitzgerald is.

06:04.665 --> 06:07.635
He is one now,
and he's gonna be an even
bigger one when he grows up.

06:07.668 --> 06:09.703
Okay?
That has nothing
to do with you.

06:09.737 --> 06:11.572
- Mm-mm.
- Here's something else,
buddy, right?

06:11.605 --> 06:13.040
- You don't have to take it.
- Mm-mm.

06:13.073 --> 06:16.777
You can tell the teacher,
you can tell the principal,
or you can tell him.

06:16.810 --> 06:17.911
You can tell him
you don't like it,

06:17.945 --> 06:19.447
you can tell him
you want it to stop,

06:19.480 --> 06:22.516
you can tell him you think
that it's wrong, okay?

06:22.550 --> 06:23.717
You don't have to take it,
little man.

06:23.751 --> 06:25.653
Mm-mm.
You know what?

06:25.686 --> 06:28.589
I bet if you just said
one word to Fitzgerald,

06:28.622 --> 06:30.123
if you just pointed
your finger at him

06:30.157 --> 06:31.925
and said, "Shut up,"

06:31.959 --> 06:34.728
he would run
under his desk, crying.

06:34.762 --> 06:36.730
- He would?
- Yeah, he would.

06:36.764 --> 06:37.865
Yeah.

06:37.898 --> 06:40.734
Daddy, do you know
any assholes?

06:40.768 --> 06:42.936
- ( laughing )
- Nice.

06:42.970 --> 06:46.474
Yes, I do.
Almost exclusively.

06:46.507 --> 06:48.208
( laughter continues )

06:48.241 --> 06:52.546
So the guy takes
his bottle of Sam Adams Ice

06:52.580 --> 06:54.081
and he dips it
in the pool

06:54.114 --> 06:56.216
and everybody cheers,
right?

06:56.249 --> 06:59.820
Because the Sam Adams Ice
has cooled it down.

06:59.853 --> 07:02.556
Music up,
pool party is saved,

07:02.590 --> 07:06.159
super comes in--
"Sam Adams Ice,

07:06.193 --> 07:09.029
cooler than cool."

07:09.062 --> 07:10.097
( exhales )

07:10.130 --> 07:12.766
Do we have to use that line?
"Cooler than cool."

07:12.800 --> 07:14.101
Client said we have to.

07:14.134 --> 07:17.170
Mikal, this is a commercial
for the urban market.

07:17.204 --> 07:19.907
- They're all black.
- Client is happy
to have Latinos.

07:19.940 --> 07:22.510
- Do black people swim?
- Mikal: What?

07:22.543 --> 07:26.246
- I'm just asking,
for believability.
- For believability.

07:26.279 --> 07:29.249
It's the city, Mikal.
Where are they gonna swim?

07:29.282 --> 07:32.920
- Okay, that's the most
racist thing I've ever heard.
- Debbie: It's not racist.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.788
It would be racist
if I said they didn't swim

07:34.822 --> 07:36.524
because they're shiftless.

07:36.557 --> 07:37.858
It's a marketing question.

07:37.891 --> 07:40.994
Validity, veracity,
verisimilitude.

07:41.028 --> 07:44.264
In a commercial
where beer makes it snow.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.734
( sighs )
I gotta get out
of this business.

07:46.767 --> 07:50.003
They're running
these scripts past their
African-American agency, Thom,

07:50.037 --> 07:51.672
and I don't feel like
losing this project

07:51.705 --> 07:54.742
because we put
a bunch of city people
in a kidney-shaped pool.

07:54.775 --> 07:57.811
Okay, what if we make it
a prison riot?

07:57.845 --> 08:00.247
Or what if it's just
a bunch of black people

08:00.280 --> 08:03.083
running wild in the streets,
raping white women?

08:03.116 --> 08:04.952
'Cause black people
run wild in the streets

08:04.985 --> 08:07.220
and rape white women,
don't they?

08:07.254 --> 08:09.557
( Lorna clears throat )

08:09.590 --> 08:11.692
Coke meeting
in Shakespeare.

08:11.725 --> 08:14.227
Oh, thank God.

08:14.261 --> 08:15.696
Am I in that meeting?

08:15.729 --> 08:17.297
David from production
called.

08:17.330 --> 08:19.232
Keebler thinks
the scripts need to be
more cookie-focused.

08:19.266 --> 08:20.968
How come I'm not
in the Coke meeting?

08:21.001 --> 08:22.836
You wanna come
to the meeting,
come to the meeting.

08:22.870 --> 08:25.038
I don't wanna
come to the meeting,
I wanna be in the meeting.

08:25.072 --> 08:26.840
If you come
to the Coke meeting,
you'll be in the Coke meeting.

08:26.874 --> 08:28.108
No, I'll be
at the Coke meeting.

08:28.141 --> 08:30.711
Whose meeting is this?
Is this your meeting?

08:30.744 --> 08:33.113
The problem
is that we already sent
the scripts to Rob Reiner,

08:33.146 --> 08:34.648
and he thinks they're
too cookie-focused,

08:34.682 --> 08:36.116
and he wants us
to de-cookie them.

08:36.149 --> 08:38.852
Look, tell David,
that piece-of-shit
head of production,

08:38.886 --> 08:40.988
that if Rob Reiner wants
the fucking script changed,

08:41.021 --> 08:43.123
Rob fucking Reiner can change
the fucking scripts.

08:43.156 --> 08:45.258
He's the dickhead
that fucked them up
in the first place.

08:45.292 --> 08:47.928
I'll tell David to get
in touch with Rob Reiner

08:47.961 --> 08:51.131
regarding his suggested
script changes.

08:51.164 --> 08:52.666
Yeah, do that.

08:52.700 --> 08:54.267
( phone rings )

08:54.301 --> 08:55.869
No.

08:55.903 --> 08:58.071
( ringing continues )

08:58.105 --> 08:59.573
Ugh.

09:01.909 --> 09:04.144
- ( answering machine beeps )
- Automated voice: Please leave
your name, number,

09:04.177 --> 09:06.279
- and message
after the beep.
- ( groans )

09:06.313 --> 09:09.082
- ( beeps )
- Woman: Hey, Lee, this is Pam,
over at the day school.

09:09.116 --> 09:10.751
It seems there has been
a little incident

09:10.784 --> 09:12.352
between Julius
and Fitzgerald Miller,

09:12.385 --> 09:15.155
and, um, we were wondering
if you could come in
right away--

09:15.188 --> 09:16.824
Hi. Hi, hi, hi.
It's me.

09:16.857 --> 09:19.593
Uh, what kind of incident?

09:21.194 --> 09:23.063
He what?

09:24.798 --> 09:26.299
Okay.
I'll be right there.

09:26.333 --> 09:28.602
- Okay. Thanks, Pam.
- ( phone beeps )

09:35.676 --> 09:37.377
Jon:
So let me get this
straight, Gottfrid.

09:37.410 --> 09:40.247
You want to walk
into the Coca-Cola
chemistry meeting,

09:40.280 --> 09:41.915
the meeting where
they will decide

09:41.949 --> 09:44.317
if we even get to pitch
the goddamn account,

09:44.351 --> 09:48.321
and tell them that they
should do no advertising?

09:48.355 --> 09:50.123
That's not what he was
suggesting, Jonathan.

09:50.157 --> 09:52.125
Then why don't you
explain it to me, Debbie?

09:52.159 --> 09:54.795
Jonathan,
we're past the days
of advertising campaigns.

09:54.828 --> 09:57.064
- Right.
- Gottfrid: We don't need
campaigns anymore.

09:57.097 --> 09:59.199
- Jonathan: We don't need--
- It's one smart idea,

09:59.232 --> 10:01.068
and it changes
the world, okay?

10:01.101 --> 10:04.271
We need ideation.
We need social integration.

10:04.304 --> 10:05.939
We need events.
We need moments.

10:05.973 --> 10:08.208
Yes, events.
We need--

10:08.241 --> 10:10.410
Yeah, exactly.
What Gustaff says.

10:10.443 --> 10:13.413
It wasn't a war that started
the Egyptian Revolution.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.015
It was fucking Facebook.

10:15.048 --> 10:17.084
And the Egyptian
revolutionaries.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.352
I don't think Egypt
is the best case study

10:19.386 --> 10:21.689
for the long-term
effectiveness of social media.

10:21.722 --> 10:25.826
Okay, look, it's like you
told me when we first met
about Al Qaeda.

10:25.859 --> 10:28.228
Do you remember?
They're a great brand.

10:28.261 --> 10:30.698
But what makes them
a great brand?

10:30.731 --> 10:32.365
They don't make campaigns.

10:32.399 --> 10:36.770
They make events.
9/11. 7/7. Charlie Hebdos.

10:36.804 --> 10:40.708
I mean,
how many hits did they get
after that Hebdo shooting?

10:40.741 --> 10:42.242
A million?
A trillion?

10:42.275 --> 10:44.845
We need to take a lesson
from our enemies here.

10:44.878 --> 10:46.446
From a marketing...

10:46.479 --> 10:49.917
Hey. Hey! I'm here!

10:49.950 --> 10:52.853
I'm here! It's me!

10:52.886 --> 10:54.788
Over here!

10:54.822 --> 10:57.925
Yes! Yes!
Oh, yes! Yes!

10:57.958 --> 10:59.459
This is Coca-fucking-Cola!

10:59.492 --> 11:03.196
They had nearly 46 billion
in sales last year.

11:03.230 --> 11:06.800
They could not be
less insurgentlike
if they fuckin' tried.

11:06.834 --> 11:09.069
Fuck you, motherfuckers!
I'm out of here.

11:09.102 --> 11:11.772
( Gottfrid continues
indistinctly )

11:13.841 --> 11:15.142
Wait.
Where are you going?

11:15.175 --> 11:18.746
Wait. Come back!
Wait, come back!

11:18.779 --> 11:21.148
Come back!

11:21.181 --> 11:24.885
Come back!
I don't belong here.

11:24.918 --> 11:28.155
- ( phone buzzing )
- Gottfrid: You don't need
a campaign full of attacks.

11:28.188 --> 11:30.758
You need one,
one good one,

11:30.791 --> 11:31.825
and you're on
the cover of...

11:31.859 --> 11:33.160
- Hey.
- Lee: It's me.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.896
- It's Julius.
- Okay, what's going on?

11:35.929 --> 11:37.965
I'm at the school.
Jules hit Fitzgerald.

11:37.998 --> 11:39.432
- Good.
- With a book.

11:39.466 --> 11:42.169
They were on the school bus.
Fitzgerald was teasing him.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.304
Jules asked him to stop,
and when he didn't, he hit him.

11:44.337 --> 11:47.240
- Hardcover?
- No, soft.
It was "Harry Potter."

11:47.274 --> 11:48.909
He's been crying
about it ever since.

11:48.942 --> 11:51.845
- Fitzgerald.
- No, Thom, Jules.

11:51.879 --> 11:54.314
He feels awful about it.
He's apologized, like,
a hundred times.

11:54.347 --> 11:56.449
You know what?
I'm glad Julius
smacked him,

11:56.483 --> 11:58.451
because that
smug little fucker
deserved it.

11:58.485 --> 12:00.120
- So I'm pleased.
- Well, I'm not glad.

12:00.153 --> 12:01.454
Now I'm supposed
to wait around here

12:01.488 --> 12:03.991
till after school
so we can discuss it.

12:04.024 --> 12:05.392
So my whole day's
gone now, gone.

12:05.425 --> 12:07.460
Got no work done today.
Nothing.

12:07.494 --> 12:10.463
Gotta get a place
to do my work, Thom.
I'm going crazy.

12:10.497 --> 12:13.333
Jesus Christ!
But that kid's the biggest
asshole in the school.

12:13.366 --> 12:15.068
We have to talk
to the principal?

12:15.102 --> 12:17.437
Is everything on this planet
ass-fucking backwards?

12:35.388 --> 12:37.190
( screaming )

12:43.931 --> 12:46.333
( breathing heavily )

12:48.468 --> 12:50.303
Thom: Fuck you.
I'm not asking your permission.

12:50.337 --> 12:52.840
Fuck you, Thom.
I need you at the Coke meeting.

12:52.873 --> 12:54.507
Jules has just been summoned
to the principal's office

12:54.541 --> 12:56.443
because he finally
had the guts to stand up
to this bully,

12:56.476 --> 12:59.246
and you think I'm gonna
sit in some fucking
soda-pop meeting?

12:59.279 --> 13:01.248
Biggest goddamn pitch
of the year, Thom.

13:01.281 --> 13:04.517
It's the biggest pitch
of the last five years.

13:04.551 --> 13:07.120
The survival of this agency
depends on this pitch,

13:07.154 --> 13:10.523
the survival of our jobs,
and that fuckin' asshole
wants to go in there

13:10.557 --> 13:13.126
pitching the death
of advertising campaigns.

13:13.160 --> 13:15.462
I know how morally opposed
you are to this industry

13:15.495 --> 13:17.597
that pays for every last shred
of your fuckin' existence,

13:17.630 --> 13:19.532
but I don't give
a shit if Julius burned
the goddamn school down.

13:19.566 --> 13:21.935
I don't care if he's being
interviewed by the police.

13:21.969 --> 13:24.404
I don't care
if he's being interviewed
by Anderson fucking Cooper.

13:24.437 --> 13:26.907
You're coming
to the meeting!

13:29.242 --> 13:32.545
- What's going on, Jonathan?
- Talking about survival.

13:32.579 --> 13:34.614
You're off the rails.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.416
Talk to me.

13:36.449 --> 13:38.485
- What is it?
- Survival...

13:38.518 --> 13:43.623
has, uh,
become more of an issue
for me of late.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.226
Are you getting fired?

13:46.259 --> 13:49.162
( scoffs)
No.

13:49.196 --> 13:53.633
11:30. That's early,
even by your standards.

13:53.666 --> 13:56.369
Nonalcoholic wine.

13:56.403 --> 13:58.238
( laughs )

13:58.271 --> 14:00.173
I can't not
recommend it enough.

14:00.207 --> 14:03.376
Wine without alcohol.
What-- who would drink that?

14:03.410 --> 14:07.314
Nobody, unless wine with
alcohol would kill them.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.049
I got the results
of my test back.

14:09.082 --> 14:12.585
It appears that
I have fucked my liver.

14:12.619 --> 14:14.454
Fucked?
How fucked?

14:14.487 --> 14:16.589
Well and truly.

14:16.623 --> 14:21.228
No booze, no pot,
no salt, no nothing.

14:22.362 --> 14:25.198
If I have any joy at all,

14:25.232 --> 14:27.267
I'm gonna be
utterly miserable.

14:27.300 --> 14:32.339
Yeah, Dani has this idea
that we have a fixed amount
of joy in our life.

14:32.372 --> 14:35.142
Once you hit it,
it's over.

14:35.175 --> 14:36.276
I guess it's--
I don't know.

14:36.309 --> 14:40.080
I drank my joy too quickly.

14:40.113 --> 14:45.552
Okay, so, uh,
if you avoid joy, then--

14:45.585 --> 14:46.954
then what happens?

14:46.987 --> 14:48.288
If I'm utterly miserable,

14:48.321 --> 14:50.357
I get to live
a long and unhappy life.

14:50.390 --> 14:51.959
That's the option.

14:51.992 --> 14:54.094
Quantity over quality.

14:54.127 --> 14:57.965
So what are you
going to do?

14:57.998 --> 14:59.599
Survive.

15:04.004 --> 15:06.006
Even if it kills me.

15:09.076 --> 15:10.643
You know
what really bugs me

15:10.677 --> 15:14.047
is that everyone
loves this asshole.

15:14.081 --> 15:15.515
Jonathan doesn't.

15:15.548 --> 15:18.585
Yeah, but the accounts
department, the creatives,

15:18.618 --> 15:21.121
they're really impressed
by this Swedish jackass.

15:21.154 --> 15:22.655
They think
he's a fucking genius.

15:22.689 --> 15:23.991
He is a genius.

15:24.024 --> 15:25.458
Oh, Christ.
Not you, too.

15:25.492 --> 15:27.995
"That which
matters the most

15:28.028 --> 15:32.465
should not give way to that
which matters the least."

15:32.499 --> 15:33.967
Socrates.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.270
Lululemon.

15:37.304 --> 15:40.473
And that is where we get
our wisdom from today.

15:40.507 --> 15:44.077
Not Socrates,
not Lao-Tzu.

15:44.111 --> 15:46.079
Lululemon.

15:46.113 --> 15:47.614
It's not hard
to be a genius

15:47.647 --> 15:50.017
in a world that
looks to shopping bags
for insights.

15:50.050 --> 15:53.620
Christ, I am appalled that
I'm even alive these days.

15:53.653 --> 15:54.621
I really am.

15:54.654 --> 15:58.425
You know, I imagine myself
going up to heaven

15:58.458 --> 16:01.028
where everybody's
hanging around,
drinking martinis,

16:01.061 --> 16:05.432
they look at me,
they say, "Hey, hi.
What era are you from?"

16:05.465 --> 16:08.768
And I say, "America,
turn of the 21st century."

16:08.801 --> 16:14.041
And then they all
bash me over the head
with their harps.

16:14.074 --> 16:16.243
Wait, they have
martinis in heaven?

16:16.276 --> 16:19.346
Well, if they didn't,
it would be hell.

16:20.680 --> 16:23.450
So, uh,
tell me about TBWA.

16:23.483 --> 16:25.185
Well,
David Reuters is out,

16:25.218 --> 16:28.588
and they're looking
for someone to run
Mars and Novartis.

16:28.621 --> 16:31.324
Wow.
Candy and pharmaceuticals.

16:31.358 --> 16:32.325
I should call my shrink.

16:32.359 --> 16:34.127
Oh, come on, Thom.

16:34.161 --> 16:37.597
Do you know that Freud
wasn't even trying
to make people happy?

16:37.630 --> 16:39.799
Did your shrink
ever tell you that?

16:39.832 --> 16:41.534
You know,
his whole project,

16:41.568 --> 16:46.339
it was just an attempt
to raise the utterly wretched

16:46.373 --> 16:49.076
up to a normal,
run-of-the-mill despair.

16:49.109 --> 16:50.543
And that's the goal in life.

16:50.577 --> 16:53.280
It's not joy.
It's not rapture.

16:53.313 --> 16:56.283
It's just being
as miserable as everyone else.

16:56.316 --> 16:59.152
Now you're wretched at MGT.

16:59.186 --> 17:01.688
Maybe you can
be miserable at TBWA.

17:01.721 --> 17:04.624
- Sounds like progress.
- Mmm.

17:04.657 --> 17:09.196
You know,
uh, I don't know if I can
leave Jonathan right now.

17:10.530 --> 17:13.200
Jonathan is gonna be okay.

17:15.802 --> 17:20.773
I thought you guys
were going to keep it
strictly biblical.

17:20.807 --> 17:22.242
I know.

17:22.275 --> 17:25.245
I'm such
a fucking asshole, right?

17:25.278 --> 17:26.679
Who isn't?

17:39.426 --> 17:42.462
There you go.

17:42.495 --> 17:44.464
Your son has a problem.

17:44.497 --> 17:48.535
- Uh, my son's problem
is your son.
- ( scoffs )

17:48.568 --> 17:50.770
Fitzgerald, honey,
why don't you go wait
in the car?

17:54.574 --> 17:56.209
Julius is a bully.

17:56.243 --> 17:58.211
Oh, Julius is a bully?

17:58.245 --> 18:00.213
He needs help.
He's a little thug.

18:00.247 --> 18:02.349
Your son's an asshole.

18:02.382 --> 18:03.816
Okay. I don't have
to listen to this.

18:03.850 --> 18:05.418
No, yeah, you do.

18:05.452 --> 18:07.154
Yes, you do.

18:07.187 --> 18:09.689
Because "asshole"
is a virus.

18:09.722 --> 18:12.825
It's passed from kid
to kid, person to person,
like the plague.

18:12.859 --> 18:15.562
Pretty soon, the whole world
is gonna be full of 'em.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.230
Do you know how
pissed you would be

18:17.264 --> 18:20.367
if someone let
their kid come to school
with lice, Stacy?

18:20.400 --> 18:23.636
You let your kid
come to school every day
with full-blown asshole.

18:23.670 --> 18:25.305
Let me tell you something.

18:25.338 --> 18:28.675
When it comes to "asshole,"
Fitzgerald is patient zero.

18:31.744 --> 18:35.582
- I understand, Lee.
You're jealous.
- Holy shit.

18:35.615 --> 18:36.783
No, and that's okay.

18:36.816 --> 18:39.652
Fitzgerald is a top student,
a star athlete,

18:39.686 --> 18:41.654
first in every class
he enters.

18:41.688 --> 18:43.923
Everyone is jealous of him.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.392
We know that.

18:45.425 --> 18:47.727
But that is
Fitzgerald's burden.

18:47.760 --> 18:51.798
But jealousy does not
give someone the right

18:51.831 --> 18:53.900
to be a bully.

18:57.437 --> 19:00.773
Is everything on this planet
ass-fucking backwards?

19:06.913 --> 19:10.250
Hey! Hey!

19:12.785 --> 19:18.358
Come back!
I'm right here!

19:18.391 --> 19:20.660
I'm right here!

19:22.662 --> 19:25.498
Please come back!

19:25.532 --> 19:28.535
I don't belong here!

19:36.609 --> 19:38.378
Thom:
Sigmund Freud.

19:38.411 --> 19:41.248
( sighs )
That's all I got.

19:41.281 --> 19:42.515
( laughter )

19:42.549 --> 19:44.451
I carry his picture around
wherever I go.

19:44.484 --> 19:46.986
He's my own little
secular "Ecce Homo,"

19:47.019 --> 19:49.789
promising me salvation
from my crippling depression.

19:49.822 --> 19:51.658
Here's an interesting
thing, though.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.526
I just learned this,
that Sigmund Freud

19:53.560 --> 19:55.595
wasn't trying
to make people happy.

19:55.628 --> 19:57.264
He was just trying
to raise people up

19:57.297 --> 20:00.600
to a normal level
of miserable.

20:00.633 --> 20:04.003
Misery is normal.
People are unhappy.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.938
So who are the real rebels?

20:05.972 --> 20:09.676
The moody poet,
the frowning rock star,

20:09.709 --> 20:12.679
or the happy people?

20:12.712 --> 20:16.616
Coca-Cola doesn't just
sell happiness.

20:16.649 --> 20:19.018
You sell
radical happiness.

20:19.051 --> 20:21.354
Happiness as rebellion.

20:21.388 --> 20:22.955
Defiant happiness.

20:22.989 --> 20:24.957
Angry bliss.

20:24.991 --> 20:26.959
Obstinate elation.

20:26.993 --> 20:29.829
Life is Good.
You know this brand?

20:29.862 --> 20:33.966
This is a
$100-million business
in over 30 countries.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.437
You know why people wear
"Life is Good" shirts?

20:37.470 --> 20:39.439
Because it's not.

20:39.472 --> 20:41.508
It's hard.
But it's easy to give in.

20:41.541 --> 20:42.842
It's easy to be weak.

20:42.875 --> 20:45.978
Coca-Cola isn't
"Don't worry, be happy."

20:46.012 --> 20:48.981
This campaign should be,
"Damn it, despite everything,

20:49.015 --> 20:52.051
despite war, despite ISIS,
despite Ebola,

20:52.084 --> 20:54.721
despite the crumbling
of Western civilization,

20:54.754 --> 20:57.324
despite your
self-obsessed mother

20:57.357 --> 21:01.594
and your domineering father
and your erectile dysfunction,

21:01.628 --> 21:04.997
despite all that,
be happy."

21:05.031 --> 21:06.466
Be happy.

21:06.499 --> 21:08.535
That's how you sell
to millennials.

21:08.568 --> 21:10.970
Radical happiness.
Punk joy.

21:14.974 --> 21:18.545
Great, Thom.

21:18.578 --> 21:19.746
I hope you know
how excited we all--

21:19.779 --> 21:21.748
I'd like to
jump in a moment.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.883
Uh, talk about campaigns.

21:23.916 --> 21:26.085
Uh, Gottfrid, we have
a limited amount of time
with these gentlemen.

21:26.118 --> 21:29.622
We're past the era
of advertising campaigns.

21:29.656 --> 21:31.624
You don't have to like it,

21:31.658 --> 21:33.893
but you can't ignore it.

21:33.926 --> 21:36.896
Campaigns are, um,
last century.

21:36.929 --> 21:38.631
We don't need
campaigns anymore.

21:38.665 --> 21:41.768
We need-- we need events.
We need moments.

21:41.801 --> 21:44.571
Why are the insurgents
winning in Iraq?

21:44.604 --> 21:47.774
Because America
is playing an old game.

21:47.807 --> 21:49.642
An old game of campaigns.

21:49.676 --> 21:52.712
Coca-Cola needs to think
like an insurgent.

21:52.745 --> 21:55.848
We need to become
an insurgent brand.

21:55.882 --> 21:58.518
We need to fly
a plane into Pepsi.

21:58.551 --> 22:00.787
We need to plant
the roadside bombs,

22:00.820 --> 22:04.391
but on the information
superhighways.

22:04.424 --> 22:06.526
Take the hilltop commercial.

22:06.559 --> 22:09.929
"I'd like to buy
the world a Coke." Yeah?

22:09.962 --> 22:13.800
That was an event.
It was a moment.

22:13.833 --> 22:16.002
Not part of some campaign.

22:16.035 --> 22:18.538
Yes, it was.

22:18.571 --> 22:21.140
It was part of
the "Real Thing" campaign.

22:21.173 --> 22:26.879
- Technically, yes--
- Gottfrid, I appreciate
your thoughts on this,

22:26.913 --> 22:31.484
but Coca-Cola
as an insurgent brand?

22:31.518 --> 22:32.885
I mean, you do understand

22:32.919 --> 22:35.888
we're a 120-year-old
company, don't you?

22:35.922 --> 22:38.425
Right? We're worth
over $200 billion.

22:38.458 --> 22:41.093
I don't see how
we could be seen
as an insurgent brand.

22:41.127 --> 22:43.563
Or that we even want
to see ourselves that way.

22:43.596 --> 22:45.565
- Frankly, I mean--
- Gentlemen.

22:45.598 --> 22:48.435
Gentlemen, may I?

22:48.468 --> 22:53.139
( speaking German )

23:00.146 --> 23:02.849
Or in a less
intimidating accent,

23:02.882 --> 23:07.787
the official 1933 Nazi Party
Organization Handbook.

23:07.820 --> 23:10.857
Arguably the most
important book

23:10.890 --> 23:13.793
in all of Hitler's
Third Reich

23:13.826 --> 23:15.728
and the most important
branding book

23:15.762 --> 23:17.530
in marketing history.

23:17.564 --> 23:19.999
This is what Coke needs.

23:20.032 --> 23:23.603
"Mein Kampf"
was for underlings.

23:23.636 --> 23:26.673
This is what
the professionals read.

23:26.706 --> 23:29.609
Bush read "Mein Kampf."
Cheney read this.

23:29.642 --> 23:31.010
( Jonathan snorts )

23:31.043 --> 23:33.746
650 pages

23:33.780 --> 23:36.883
of exacting,
illustrated information

23:36.916 --> 23:39.819
on brand attributes,
logos, fonts,

23:39.852 --> 23:42.021
graphics,
and brand personality.

23:42.054 --> 23:46.025
It is the absolute model
for effective marketing.

23:46.058 --> 23:50.563
There is no brand
that was as powerful
as the Nazi brand.

23:50.597 --> 23:51.898
Not even yours.

23:51.931 --> 23:54.033
Whatever marketing term
you wanna use,

23:54.066 --> 23:56.836
whatever message
you wanna deliver,

23:56.869 --> 23:59.238
the goal is the same.

23:59.271 --> 24:01.841
Domination.

24:01.874 --> 24:03.843
See, I think
radical happiness--

24:03.876 --> 24:05.912
I think it's a big idea.

24:05.945 --> 24:07.113
But the critical thing,

24:07.146 --> 24:10.650
the one thing that I want you
to take away from this meeting

24:10.683 --> 24:13.786
is that Coca-Cola
is not a brand.

24:13.820 --> 24:16.188
It's an uber brand.

24:16.222 --> 24:21.260
It's a movement that deserves
a fanatical devotion.

24:21.293 --> 24:25.932
If we are lucky enough
to be chosen by you
to pitch this account,

24:25.965 --> 24:29.936
I can assure you
we will not rest,
we will not falter.

24:29.969 --> 24:33.673
Your mission
is our mission.

24:33.706 --> 24:36.543
We are playing
for one thing only.

24:36.576 --> 24:39.579
( speaks German )

24:42.314 --> 24:46.018
* I'd like to give
the world a Coke *

24:46.052 --> 24:50.089
- * And drink it cheerfully
- * That's for me

24:50.122 --> 24:53.693
* I'd like to get
the world to sing *

24:53.726 --> 24:55.094
- * In--
- Cut!

24:55.127 --> 24:58.831
Cut. Cut. Cut!

24:58.865 --> 25:02.101
That wasn't very happy,
was it?

25:02.134 --> 25:04.236
I told you to be happy.

25:04.270 --> 25:07.640
Not a little happy,
not sort of happy,

25:07.674 --> 25:09.576
happy happy!

25:09.609 --> 25:12.645
We are all happy
all the time.

25:12.679 --> 25:15.014
We are all happy, ja?!

25:16.282 --> 25:17.283
( thud )

25:18.618 --> 25:19.586
( mutters in German )

25:19.619 --> 25:20.987
( clears throat )

25:21.020 --> 25:23.189
Let's take it from the top!

25:23.222 --> 25:28.260
Hey, listen.
I can't believe you got out
that Nazi book today.

25:28.294 --> 25:29.862
Why?

25:29.896 --> 25:31.798
It's the third time
you've done it in six months.

25:31.831 --> 25:35.668
That's not true.
I used it once before
in the Chase pitch.

25:35.702 --> 25:37.003
What about Google?

25:37.036 --> 25:39.205
Uh, yes. Okay.
You're right.

25:39.238 --> 25:42.675
But if there's anyone
who ever wanted to take over
the entire world,

25:42.709 --> 25:45.745
it's those
crazy motherfuckers.

25:45.778 --> 25:47.747
What can I say?
Survival--

25:47.780 --> 25:52.218
it ain't pretty,
but it's all we got.

25:52.251 --> 25:53.753
To tonic water.

25:53.786 --> 25:55.988
And acceptable
levels of misery.

26:00.326 --> 26:03.896
Thom:
So the whole mother ship thing
may have started as a joke,

26:03.930 --> 26:06.766
but now
I'm pretty sure it isn't.

26:06.799 --> 26:10.036
If I hadn't met Lee,
it wouldn't be funny at all.

26:10.069 --> 26:13.706
We're the only ones on Earth
the other one can stand.

26:13.740 --> 26:16.976
Maybe that's all you can
ask for on this planet--

26:17.009 --> 26:19.646
one nonasshole.

26:19.679 --> 26:21.247
Oh. Hey!

26:21.280 --> 26:22.649
Thom:
Two if you're lucky.

26:22.682 --> 26:23.850
Come here.
( growls )

26:23.883 --> 26:25.317
Mwah.

26:25.351 --> 26:27.787
Thom:
After all,
the pursuit of happiness

26:27.820 --> 26:29.789
is the source
of all unhappiness.

26:29.822 --> 26:31.323
- Hey!
- Hey.

26:31.357 --> 26:32.659
Welcome home.

26:32.692 --> 26:34.661
Thom:
You know who said that?

26:34.694 --> 26:35.795
Lulu-fucking-lemon.

26:35.828 --> 26:37.263
- Oh, great.
- Want a beer?

26:37.296 --> 26:42.201
Thom:
Here on planet asshole,
the shopping bag knows all.

26:42.234 --> 26:45.204
* If you're happy
and you know it,
clap your hands *

26:45.237 --> 26:47.807
* If you're happy and you
know it, clap your hands *

26:47.840 --> 26:50.409
* If you're happy and you
know it, then your face
will surely show it *

26:50.442 --> 26:53.212
* If you're happy
and you know it,
clap your hands *

26:53.245 --> 26:55.882
* If you're happy and you
know it, clap your hands *

26:55.915 --> 26:58.685
* If you're happy
and you know it,
clap your hands *

26:58.718 --> 27:01.387
* If you're happy and you
know it, then your face
will surely show it *

27:01.420 --> 27:04.156
* If you're happy
and you know it,
clap your hands *

27:04.190 --> 27:06.826
* If you're happy and you
know it, clap your hands *

27:06.859 --> 27:09.696
* If you're happy
and you know it,
clap your hands *

27:09.729 --> 27:12.364
* If you're happy and you
know it, then your face
will surely show it *

27:12.398 --> 27:15.167
* If you're happy
and you know it,
clap your hands *

27:15.201 --> 27:17.970
* If you're happy and you
know it, clap your hands *

27:18.004 --> 27:20.773
* If you're happy
and you know it,
clap your hands *

27:20.807 --> 27:23.442
* If you're
happy and you know it,
then motherfucking show it *

27:23.475 --> 27:26.378
* If you're happy
and you know it, clap your
motherfucking hands *

27:26.412 --> 27:28.915
* If you're happy and you
know it, then your face
will surely show it *

27:28.948 --> 27:32.418
* If you're happy
and you know it,
clap your hands! *
