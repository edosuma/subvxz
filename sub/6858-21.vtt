WEBVTT

00:17.559 --> 00:19.268
ANNOUNCER: Turmoil in the Outer Rim!

00:19.394 --> 00:22.438
Located near a major hyperspace lane,
the planet Felucia

00:22.564 --> 00:26.525
is caught in an unending battle
between Republic and Separatist forces.

00:26.609 --> 00:31.113
Clone tank divisions make a valiant push
deep into Separatist controlled territory

00:31.239 --> 00:34.950
led by Anakin Skywalker
and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano.

00:35.076 --> 00:38.454
General Grievous
learning of the impending Jedi attack,

00:38.496 --> 00:41.790
has dispatched reinforcements
to one of his droid outposts

00:41.833 --> 00:44.626
hoping to secure his grip on the system.

01:04.689 --> 01:07.524
PLO: Droid re-enforcements
have just arrived.

01:07.650 --> 01:11.153
We shall break into three groups
to divide their defenses.

01:11.279 --> 01:14.865
I'll take the left flank.
Skywalker, attack the front gate,

01:15.533 --> 01:19.620
Ahsoka, you scale the back wall,
we'll meet in the middle.

01:20.830 --> 01:24.875
Okay, scouts, find me a way down there,
quiet-like.

01:25.502 --> 01:27.669
Going through the front gate won't be easy.

01:28.171 --> 01:30.506
You have it tougher going over that wall.

01:30.715 --> 01:33.467
You taught me well. I can handle anything.

01:35.178 --> 01:36.804
Don't get cocky.

01:54.405 --> 01:58.200
-Hold up, I sense something out there.
-COMET: A droid?

02:00.537 --> 02:01.829
I don't think so.

02:03.915 --> 02:05.707
Probably just an animal.

02:08.086 --> 02:12.381
-Come on, we got to get to that wall.
-Stay alert, men. Let's move.

02:26.813 --> 02:29.731
-(COMLINK BEEPING)
-Skywalker, Ahsoka, are you in position?

02:33.903 --> 02:35.529
Ready and waiting, Master Plo.

02:42.245 --> 02:43.620
We're in position.

02:44.038 --> 02:48.709
We are detecting several Republic tanks
moving in on the ridge in front of us.

02:49.794 --> 02:51.753
-(COMLINK BEEPING)
-Artillery, open fire.

03:01.264 --> 03:03.932
Form up for counter attack. Lower the gate.

03:04.601 --> 03:06.768
Forward, forward, attack!

03:14.944 --> 03:19.114
-ANAKIN: Steady, steady, wait for my move.
-Copy that.

03:28.374 --> 03:29.708
Follow me.

03:46.059 --> 03:48.560
Comet, Sinker, Boost, get up there.

04:00.323 --> 04:04.159
-We're all clear, Commander, come on up.
-I'll be right there.

04:06.329 --> 04:07.704
(RIFLE CHARGING)

04:08.957 --> 04:09.957
(EXCLAIMS)

04:10.166 --> 04:12.251
(GROANS)

04:16.673 --> 04:22.344
I can't believe my luck, a Jedi youngling.

04:36.901 --> 04:38.527
The outpost is secure.

04:38.695 --> 04:41.738
Good job, Corporal.
Where's Commander Tano?

04:41.864 --> 04:44.366
She was covering our flank
when we scaled the wall.

04:44.409 --> 04:47.869
Everybody fan out.
I want a perimeter sweep now.

04:48.997 --> 04:51.123
-(COMLINK BEEPING)
-Ahsoka, state your location.

04:52.709 --> 04:55.794
Ahsoka, come in. Are you there?
Can you hear me?

04:56.212 --> 04:57.212
(GROANS)

04:58.548 --> 04:59.548
(MOANS)

04:59.716 --> 05:02.968
Ahsoka, come in. Where could she be?

05:03.970 --> 05:06.263
Ahsoka, can you hear me? Ahsoka!

05:06.889 --> 05:09.474
You won't be needing this.

05:11.853 --> 05:12.853
(GROWLS)

05:15.315 --> 05:19.651
Hey, what is this place?
Who are these pirates?

05:19.736 --> 05:22.404
These are Trandoshans,

05:22.447 --> 05:25.824
they're gonna release us
and hunt us down for sport.

05:26.409 --> 05:27.909
Hunt us down?

05:30.496 --> 05:34.458
We have found new prey for the hunt.

05:34.584 --> 05:38.670
The youngling will provide great sport.

05:39.005 --> 05:41.506
Perhaps your first Jedi kill.

05:43.259 --> 05:45.635
Are you ready, Young Dar?

05:46.262 --> 05:48.597
She'll die by my claw.

05:58.358 --> 06:01.985
Your son will outplay all comers.

06:19.045 --> 06:22.547
We'll take this new batch to Island Four.

06:32.850 --> 06:33.850
(GATES OPENING)

06:35.144 --> 06:37.938
(WIND BLOWING)

06:44.821 --> 06:48.532
Time to see
who's smart enough to join the hunt.

06:49.200 --> 06:50.575
Open fire!

07:23.276 --> 07:25.277
You need to come with us.

07:26.446 --> 07:27.863
Who are you?

07:29.031 --> 07:30.991
We used to be Jedi younglings.

07:57.393 --> 08:01.354
We never stood a chance.
They attacked us on a training mission.

08:01.397 --> 08:03.857
We were captured and brought here.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.901
Why would they take younglings?

08:05.943 --> 08:09.237
Because Jedi Knights
are too powerful for them.

08:09.280 --> 08:12.073
I'm Kalifa. This is O-Mer and Jinx.

08:12.909 --> 08:15.410
-Who are you?
-Ahsoka Tano.

08:15.453 --> 08:19.539
I was captured during the Battle of Felucia.
I'm a Padawan learner.

08:20.458 --> 08:23.752
-What's the situation here?
-You'd better sit down.

08:24.420 --> 08:27.589
We were taken by those foul lizards
for their amusement.

08:27.673 --> 08:31.426
To be hunted, killed
and mounted on their wall as trophies.

08:32.053 --> 08:35.180
We've been stuck here for more rotations
than we can count.

08:35.264 --> 08:39.434
No one has come for us.
I doubt anyone is still looking.

08:39.560 --> 08:44.064
Chew on that, Padawan, then rest.
You'll need your strength.

08:50.112 --> 08:53.114
General, we've been over the same area
a dozen times,

08:53.241 --> 08:55.075
there's no sign of Commander Tano.

08:55.117 --> 08:57.619
Not good enough, Rex, try again.

09:00.373 --> 09:03.041
We have alerted our forces
throughout the Outer Rim

09:03.125 --> 09:06.211
and intelligence assets
inside the Confederacy.

09:06.796 --> 09:10.131
-If she's spotted, we shall know about it.
-Good.

09:10.633 --> 09:15.971
Skywalker, our mission here is finished.
We must return to Coruscant.

09:16.764 --> 09:18.431
I am not abandoning her.

09:18.474 --> 09:21.518
Your emotions are clouding your judgment.

09:21.602 --> 09:25.564
-I will not leave her fate up to others.
-It's time to go.

09:28.234 --> 09:29.234
(SIGHS)

09:29.485 --> 09:32.821
-(COMLINK BEEPING)
-Call everybody in, Rex, we're leaving.

09:40.246 --> 09:42.205
Ahsoka, it's time to go.

09:43.207 --> 09:44.624
What's happened?

09:44.709 --> 09:47.711
The sun's almost up
which means we clear out.

09:51.132 --> 09:53.133
-Where do you go?
-We keep moving

09:53.217 --> 09:56.595
and keep those disgusting hunters
from picking up our scent.

09:58.097 --> 09:59.806
That's your plan?

09:59.890 --> 10:04.394
If you really are a Padawan, you would
know there's wisdom in experience.

10:04.478 --> 10:07.314
We've been here longer.
You will learn if you listen.

10:07.398 --> 10:09.733
And only if you listen.

10:27.918 --> 10:33.214
The sun has risen, let the hunt begin!

10:34.383 --> 10:37.218
(ALL HOWLING AND SNARLING)

11:13.130 --> 11:16.508
Get down. Someone's coming.

11:21.514 --> 11:24.224
Those two came in with me,
we should help them.

11:24.308 --> 11:26.434
No, it's too late.

11:34.276 --> 11:36.111
(LAUGHING)

11:39.281 --> 11:40.865
Look at her run.

11:44.620 --> 11:47.497
It's your shot, take her out.

11:50.960 --> 11:51.960
Ugh!

12:04.473 --> 12:06.224
We could've stopped them.

12:06.308 --> 12:11.354
No, Ahsoka, we are not saviors here.
Here, we are survivors.

12:13.482 --> 12:16.192
If they had spotted us we'd be dead now.

12:16.736 --> 12:19.821
We'll never get out of here
if we just keep hiding.

12:20.281 --> 12:21.906
We have to act.

12:23.743 --> 12:27.662
There were other Padawans here
that once thought as you do now.

12:28.664 --> 12:31.833
-All right, where are they?
-They're dead!

12:33.836 --> 12:38.256
Just because they failed
doesn't mean we will.

12:38.340 --> 12:39.799
You don't understand,

12:39.884 --> 12:43.762
it's not that we don't want to fight,
we're younglings.

12:43.888 --> 12:45.513
They have every advantage.

12:50.227 --> 12:52.729
-Get back here.
-I can't do that.

12:53.522 --> 12:54.856
My Master would never forgive me

12:54.982 --> 12:57.609
for running and hiding
in a situation like this.

12:58.027 --> 13:00.528
Do not overestimate your abilities.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.031
I'm not.

13:04.033 --> 13:05.575
Ahsoka, don't...

13:14.043 --> 13:17.921
Here, lizard, lizard. Come and find me.

13:26.347 --> 13:27.347
(SNARLS)

13:40.569 --> 13:41.986
(GROANING)

13:45.407 --> 13:51.120
Kalifa! Don't kill him out of hatred.
It's not the Jedi way.

13:58.754 --> 14:01.339
(HOWLING)

14:16.438 --> 14:18.273
The others will be coming.

14:35.499 --> 14:39.043
I don't understand,
why won't this thing work?

14:39.169 --> 14:42.672
The Trandoshans deactivate the blasters
if we take them.

14:42.756 --> 14:45.133
That is why none of us have any.

14:48.679 --> 14:50.597
It's been a long time since the Trandoshans

14:50.681 --> 14:53.391
captured another Padawan
and brought them here.

14:54.476 --> 14:57.186
-Thanks.
-I didn't mean it as an insult.

14:57.271 --> 15:02.191
I meant it as a sign, a mistake on their part.

15:03.027 --> 15:08.698
Ahsoka, your energy, your strength,
it's what we've been lacking.

15:09.491 --> 15:12.869
We were beginning to lose hope
and forgot who we are.

15:14.622 --> 15:16.247
And who are you?

15:17.750 --> 15:19.125
We are Jedi.

15:20.878 --> 15:23.087
All right, we need a strategy.

15:23.797 --> 15:27.300
-So, what do you suggest?
-What about a base?

15:27.343 --> 15:30.345
I mean, they must have a compound
or something, right?

15:30.429 --> 15:32.347
Not that we've ever seen.

15:32.431 --> 15:34.307
So where do they come from?

15:34.350 --> 15:38.937
We don't know, we've only witnessed them
hunting and in their hover pods.

15:39.021 --> 15:42.523
If we are gonna go on the offensive,
we'll need to find out where they live.

15:42.816 --> 15:45.443
We'll start covering ground tomorrow.

15:45.861 --> 15:51.866
Dar! Dar! Dar! Dar! Dar! Dar!

15:52.201 --> 15:56.955
Dar! Dar! Dar! Dar! Dar! Dar!

16:12.346 --> 16:13.346
(GASPS)

16:33.242 --> 16:35.243
We have already covered the beach area

16:35.369 --> 16:38.246
and most of the briar
on this side of the bay.

16:38.414 --> 16:39.414
(CHUCKLES)

16:39.498 --> 16:43.001
If it was easy to find, you guys
would have found it before I got here.

16:43.085 --> 16:44.085
(CHUCKLES)

16:44.169 --> 16:45.378
True enough.

16:45.421 --> 16:48.548
-Maybe we should try more inland?
-It's worth a shot.

16:49.425 --> 16:53.553
Guys, I think
we're looking in the wrong place.

16:54.054 --> 16:56.014
That's their fortress.

16:59.518 --> 17:00.727
Split up!

17:29.173 --> 17:30.631
O-Mer, this way!

17:49.651 --> 17:50.818
Kalifa!

17:50.986 --> 17:52.862
(GRUNTING)

17:56.033 --> 18:02.705
-Finish her, my son, the kill is yours.
-I will kill her with my own hands.

18:02.998 --> 18:05.249
(GROANING)

18:20.891 --> 18:23.643
Come here, you Jedi whelp.

18:35.155 --> 18:37.824
Not so impressive, are you?

18:37.866 --> 18:42.328
And yet you have the honor of being
my first Jedi kill.

18:43.539 --> 18:45.873
First of many, I hope.

18:47.543 --> 18:48.543
(DAR GROANS)

19:24.413 --> 19:25.913
(SCREAMING)

-Careful.
-It's okay. I can make it.

19:43.473 --> 19:44.473
(GROANS)

19:45.392 --> 19:46.601
Kalifa!

19:47.811 --> 19:51.397
Those Jedi whelps killed my son.

19:52.232 --> 19:54.066
Young Dar!

19:57.738 --> 20:01.741
There's no escape! I'll hunt you down!

20:04.661 --> 20:09.332
-Move us in closer!
-We can't, the brush is too thick.

20:09.458 --> 20:11.751
Kalifa, we have to move, hurry.

20:12.920 --> 20:16.130
Please, Ahsoka, leave me.

20:16.798 --> 20:19.592
-I won't.
-You have to.

20:21.929 --> 20:24.597
Ahsoka, please take care...

20:25.849 --> 20:28.100
I'll take care of the others.

20:28.936 --> 20:30.519
I know you will.

20:48.163 --> 20:51.666
I'll kill you! You killed my son!

20:53.001 --> 20:54.502
I'll kill you!

20:57.506 --> 20:59.674
You can't hide from me!

21:06.098 --> 21:11.352
-What is Ahsoka's strength?
-She is fearless.

21:11.895 --> 21:14.021
That can also be a weakness.

21:15.774 --> 21:17.942
Is she a worthy apprentice?

21:18.777 --> 21:21.404
No one has her kind of determination.

21:23.031 --> 21:24.407
Except you.

21:25.534 --> 21:27.034
I'll find her.

21:27.786 --> 21:30.955
This may not be within your power.

21:32.249 --> 21:35.710
Whatever you're trying to say, Master Plo,
just say it.

21:37.296 --> 21:41.882
I am suggesting that perhaps,
if you have trained her well,

21:42.551 --> 21:48.973
she shall take care of herself,
and find a way back to you.
