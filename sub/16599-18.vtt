Let's talk about
what went wrong here, all right?

02:11.565 --> 02:14.332
Making a safe entry
is very important.

02:14.367 --> 02:17.335
Maintain situational awareness
at all times.

02:17.370 --> 02:19.905
You need to expect
the unexpected.

02:19.940 --> 02:22.641
That is one of the,
one of the main keys

02:22.676 --> 02:24.943
to executing a

02:24.978 --> 02:27.746
Communicating your actions,

02:38.291 --> 02:41.193
Uh-huh, yeah.

02:41.228 --> 02:43.461
Well, you want to...

02:43.496 --> 02:45.964
Got something you want to add,
Detective Williams?

02:45.999 --> 02:47.832
No. I-I want to make sure
that that's what you--

02:47.867 --> 02:49.668
'Cause I-- that's what I think.
I think that trust

02:49.703 --> 02:52.237

02:52.272 --> 02:54.372
You got to trust the person
you're working with, right?

02:54.407 --> 02:56.374
Yeah. Like I said.
I'm gonna actually keep going,

02:56.409 --> 02:57.241

02:57.277 --> 02:59.344
Um, to piggyback
what you were saying,

02:59.379 --> 03:01.980
trust also is not just
for tactical situations,

03:02.015 --> 03:04.716
but it's also very important
all aspects of the job.

03:04.751 --> 03:07.686

Just a show of hands.

03:28.008 --> 03:29.474
No, no, no, no. Don't involve

Show of hands.

Anybody who would
have a problem,

03:34.814 --> 03:37.749
uh, trusting their partner after
they snuck into your office

03:37.784 --> 03:39.417
and looked at all your stuff.

03:39.452 --> 03:40.685
Why'd I go in your office?
I don't know.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.254
I needed a pen, okay?

03:42.289 --> 03:44.322
I didn't think I needed
security clearance for that.

03:44.357 --> 03:45.690
No. Do you need
security clearance

03:45.725 --> 03:47.459
to read my personal
private information?

03:47.494 --> 03:48.693
You need security clearance
for that?

03:48.729 --> 03:52.497
I glanced at a list that you had
called "The Things I Like,"

03:52.532 --> 03:54.532
you'd scrawled on the back
of a Zippy's receipt

03:54.567 --> 03:55.867

03:55.902 --> 03:56.968

03:57.003 --> 03:57.969
I don't see
what the big deal is.

03:58.004 --> 04:00.305
Of course you don't see
what the big deal is,

04:00.340 --> 04:01.640
because you're not the one
who has an issue-- I do.

04:01.675 --> 04:03.008
And by the way,

04:03.043 --> 04:04.643
I'd never seen this guy
use a pen in seven years.

04:04.678 --> 04:05.944
He uses crayons.

04:05.979 --> 04:07.579
Like, uh, like, uh,

04:07.614 --> 04:08.813
Little kid.
- Uh-huh.

04:08.848 --> 04:09.881
Says the one throwing

04:09.916 --> 04:10.948
a temper tantrum. Maybe
you should take a time-out.

04:10.984 --> 04:13.418
I'll take a time-out if
it gets me out of here,

04:13.453 --> 04:14.986
gets me away from you,
I'll take a time-out.

04:15.021 --> 04:16.355
Okay, okay.
- What?

04:18.325 --> 04:20.792
I think, uh, we
can all agree

04:20.827 --> 04:23.328

a lot today.

04:28.601 --> 04:30.335
Yep.

04:42.816 --> 04:44.783
You're overreacting,
a little bit.

04:44.818 --> 04:47.552
Okay. You invaded my privacy.

04:47.587 --> 04:50.422
I have a right
to be upset, okay?

04:50.457 --> 04:52.457
It's not snooping
if something's out in the open.

04:52.492 --> 04:53.258
That's the rule.

04:53.293 --> 04:54.993
That's not a rule.
Are you serious?

04:55.028 --> 04:56.661
If it's not hidden,
it's not forbidden.

04:56.696 --> 04:57.795
You never heard of that?

04:57.831 --> 05:00.865
No. I never heard of it,
because you just made that up.

05:00.900 --> 05:02.801
First of all, it's ridiculous
to me that you would even write

05:02.836 --> 05:04.336
a letter like that,
but second of all,

05:04.371 --> 05:06.404
the fact that you're getting
so worked up about it,

05:06.439 --> 05:08.907
it tells me, it informs me, that
this is not just about this.

05:08.942 --> 05:10.075
It's something else deeper.

05:10.110 --> 05:11.509
I know you. It's deeper.

05:11.544 --> 05:13.645
So why don't you tell
me what's going on

05:13.680 --> 05:15.013

05:15.048 --> 05:16.614

05:16.649 --> 05:17.882
That's it, okay?

05:17.917 --> 05:20.485
Don't tell me,
that's fine.

05:20.520 --> 05:21.820
Okay.
Can we drop it, then?

05:21.855 --> 05:22.888
Mm-hmm.

05:29.896 --> 05:32.364
If it's not put away, looking's
okay. It's another one.

Please, take me home.

10:05.371 --> 10:08.272
Well, Xander's body

10:08.307 --> 10:11.142
Obviously, it was put there

Interpol's onto him,

10:41.474 --> 10:43.775
he could be looking
to disappear.

10:43.810 --> 10:44.909
Yeah.

10:44.944 --> 10:45.944
But what if he isn't?

10:58.157 --> 11:00.258
GROVER: HPD found a laptop
at Xander's house.

11:00.293 --> 11:02.427
We had Eric go through it;
he found e-mails and payments

11:02.462 --> 11:04.996

11:14.807 --> 11:17.141
he's not been taken
as a serious threat.

11:17.176 --> 11:19.310
All right, so this is the guy
that hired Xander

11:19.345 --> 11:21.179
to bring Abati
into Hawaii.

11:21.214 --> 11:22.080
KONO:
Yeah.

11:22.115 --> 11:23.481
And Eric also found this.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.216
It's a map
of Waimea Falls jungle

11:25.251 --> 11:26.818
that Xander shared
with Tahan.

11:26.853 --> 11:29.754
And the area that's circled
is just over an acre in size.

11:29.789 --> 11:30.621
All right,
so maybe this is

11:30.657 --> 11:32.156
where they set him up,
like a safe house.

11:32.191 --> 11:34.859
That's a pretty remote location
for a safe house.

11:34.894 --> 11:36.994
There could be another reason
that Tahan was interested

11:37.029 --> 11:38.128
in this particular spot.

11:38.164 --> 11:41.165
The reason he showed up
on the Fed's radar to begin with

11:41.200 --> 11:43.101
is from an online post
that floated the idea

11:43.136 --> 11:46.938
of starting up a terrorist
training camp on U.S. soil.

11:46.973 --> 11:49.107
Well, that makes more sense
for a safe house now.

11:49.142 --> 11:51.743
DANNY: So what you're saying
is that they're

11:51.778 --> 11:54.078
potentially up there teaching
people how to build bombs.

11:54.113 --> 11:56.080
Maybe, or he could be
with Tahan in Kalaeloa.

11:56.115 --> 11:58.850
Or anything. I mean, at this
point, we don't know what it is.

11:58.885 --> 12:01.519
All right, Chin, you and Kono
go have a look at Tahan's place.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.454
Danny and I are gonna
check this location out.

12:03.489 --> 12:05.790
How are we gonna check
out that location?

12:05.825 --> 12:08.193
There's no roads in,
no roads out.

12:13.232 --> 12:15.233
Why did I agree to this?

12:15.268 --> 12:16.968
It's like you said,

12:17.003 --> 12:19.203
there's no roads
in or out of here.

12:19.238 --> 12:22.273
This is so dumb.
This is dumb!

12:22.308 --> 12:23.474
Just relax, all right?

12:23.509 --> 12:25.343
You're gonna be fine,
you're gonna be fine.

12:25.378 --> 12:27.945
When this light goes green,
we're gonna jump, okay?

12:27.980 --> 12:30.081
No, I-I don't want--
You know what?

12:30.116 --> 12:32.183
I don't want to do it,
'cause if I die,

12:32.218 --> 12:34.218
I don't want to be strapped
to you like an infant.

12:34.253 --> 12:35.520
(beeping)

12:35.555 --> 12:37.288
All right, here we go, buddy!

12:37.323 --> 12:39.324
(Danny yelling)

12:55.241 --> 12:58.409
(Danny groaning)

12:58.444 --> 13:00.344
I don't like it.

13:00.379 --> 13:02.013
Just breathe, Danny.

13:02.048 --> 13:04.215
I hate you.
I hate you.

13:04.250 --> 13:05.450
Wasn't that something?

13:06.319 --> 13:08.252
I hate you.

13:08.287 --> 13:10.955
STEVE: Try opening your eyes,
buddy. Look.

13:10.990 --> 13:12.256
Look at how high we are.

13:12.291 --> 13:14.492
(laughing)

13:14.527 --> 13:16.527
Why don't you
just admit it, huh?

13:16.562 --> 13:19.063
Admit it, you loved it.
Who doesn't love skydiving?

13:19.098 --> 13:21.432
In fact, I'm willing
to bet that skydiving

13:21.467 --> 13:23.601
is gonna go
on that list of yours.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.403
Right after
baseball and...

13:25.438 --> 13:27.939
hoagies and
complaining and...

13:27.974 --> 13:29.440
Pretty sure hoagies and
complaining was not on my list.

13:29.475 --> 13:31.342
No, it was not on the list,
but it should've been.

13:31.377 --> 13:33.110
Instead that list
was full of things

13:33.145 --> 13:34.879
that you've never shown
any interest in

13:34.914 --> 13:36.881
in your entire life,
like travel.

13:36.916 --> 13:38.616
DANNY: What are you talking
about? I love to travel.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.551
Danny, every time you're
on a plane with me,

13:40.586 --> 13:42.086
you moan and groan
the entire trip.

13:42.121 --> 13:44.288
That's because every time
I am on a plane with you,

13:44.323 --> 13:45.356
there's a good chance

13:45.391 --> 13:47.558
I'm gonna die
when I land, okay?

13:47.593 --> 13:49.160
Wh-What is your obsession
with this list?

13:49.195 --> 13:51.195
Leave it alone. Please. No,
I don't have an obsession.

13:51.230 --> 13:53.331
I have a mild curiosity,
all right?

13:53.366 --> 13:56.434
That you would A, write a list
like that in the first place,

13:56.469 --> 13:58.936
and B, be so hypersensitive
about it.

13:58.971 --> 14:00.938
Ah. So that means you're
<i>not</i> gonna leave it alone.

14:00.973 --> 14:02.874
Is that right?
- You've known me for seven years now.

14:02.909 --> 14:04.275
What do you think?
Okay. (clears throat)

14:04.310 --> 14:06.577
Okay, hey, hey, hey,
okay, listen.

14:06.612 --> 14:08.880
Stop for one second.
You want to know?

14:08.915 --> 14:10.414
Yeah.
Okay, I'll tell you.

14:10.449 --> 14:13.317
That was a list of things
that I'd like to do

14:13.352 --> 14:15.419
when I retire, okay?

14:15.454 --> 14:17.221
You happy now?
I said it.

14:17.256 --> 14:19.190
Now we can continue.
After you, please.

14:19.225 --> 14:20.458
I'm sorry, excuse me. Retire?

14:20.493 --> 14:22.193
That's what I said,
when I retire.

14:22.228 --> 14:23.594
I'm coming up on 20 years.

14:23.629 --> 14:25.396
Okay? I'm gonna
pension out very soon.

14:25.431 --> 14:27.465
I got to think
about what comes next.

14:27.500 --> 14:28.966
You're serious right now?

14:29.001 --> 14:30.167
I'm absolutely serious.

14:30.202 --> 14:32.536
No, I want to do this for
the rest of my life with you.

14:32.571 --> 14:34.605
Unlike you,
I don't want to do this.

14:34.640 --> 14:37.275
Okay. All right. I just want
to get it straight, all right?

14:37.310 --> 14:39.277
You retire, you retire,

14:39.312 --> 14:42.280
and then, uh... what?

14:42.315 --> 14:43.147
(smacks lips)

14:43.183 --> 14:46.150
I don't know,
maybe open a restaurant.

14:47.653 --> 14:50.054
Open a restaurant?
That's right.

14:50.089 --> 14:51.389
A nice Italian restaurant.

14:51.424 --> 14:52.990
You know, like a, like a,

14:53.025 --> 14:54.425
like a little neighborhood
kind of joint.

14:54.460 --> 14:55.660
You know,
use my grandmother's recipes.

14:55.695 --> 14:57.261
It'll be, uh...

14:57.296 --> 14:59.196
it'll be very ni...
Where am I going?

14:59.231 --> 15:01.299
Italian restaurant on Oahu.

15:01.334 --> 15:04.468
Oahu could use a nice Italian
restaurant, don't you think?

15:04.503 --> 15:05.970
Anyway, that's what
I'd like to do,

15:06.005 --> 15:08.306
and you are now free
to mock me all you want.

15:08.341 --> 15:10.041
No, I'm not gonna mock you.

15:10.076 --> 15:11.475
No?
- No.

15:11.510 --> 15:12.543
Okay.

15:12.578 --> 15:14.979
I'm gonna tell you that
80% of restaurants fail

15:15.014 --> 15:16.647
in the first six months, though.
(chuckles): Yeah?

15:16.682 --> 15:19.183
Okay, we don't have to talk
about this anymore, then.

15:27.727 --> 15:29.460
Clear!

15:29.495 --> 15:30.461
OFFICER:
Clear!

15:30.496 --> 15:32.363
Clear!
- Clear!

15:32.398 --> 15:33.597
Copy that, copy that.

15:33.633 --> 15:35.666
That was Chin. Him and Kono
just finished clearing Tahan...

15:35.701 --> 15:36.935
MAN:
Don't move.

15:43.175 --> 15:45.376
STEVE:
You smell that?

15:45.411 --> 15:46.711
DANNY:
Bleach?

15:46.746 --> 15:49.380
STEVE:
Yeah, they're cooking TATP.

15:49.415 --> 15:51.482
A lot of it.

15:51.517 --> 15:54.118
Those yellow things
on their belts are dosimeters.

15:54.153 --> 15:57.154
They measure
radiation exposure.

15:57.189 --> 15:59.524
Good news is we found
our missing uranium.

16:03.429 --> 16:05.663
STEVE: And our
missing bomb maker.

16:18.577 --> 16:20.511
Don't stop.

16:40.599 --> 16:41.532
(grunts)

16:45.471 --> 16:46.437
(grunts)

16:48.340 --> 16:49.774
Hey! Move!

16:58.451 --> 17:00.118
(gunfire continues)

17:05.424 --> 17:06.624
Abati's getting away!

17:15.301 --> 17:16.600
Danny.

17:16.635 --> 17:18.269
STEVE:
Hey! Hey, hey!

17:18.304 --> 17:20.104
(beeping)
Hey!

17:23.676 --> 17:25.543
(steady beeping)

17:25.578 --> 17:27.611
Where's the uranium?

17:27.646 --> 17:29.647
Where's the uranium?

17:45.498 --> 17:47.532
(steady beeping)

17:50.503 --> 17:52.570
Okay, all right, we got an hour.

17:52.605 --> 17:54.572
Can you defuse it?

17:54.607 --> 17:55.606
If I had
an instruction manual, maybe.

18:10.189 --> 18:13.624
Getting no cell service.
And this... satphone here

18:13.659 --> 18:16.360
with the bullet hole in it, I'm
pretty sure the warranty's void.

18:16.395 --> 18:18.262
So, please,
tell me you have something.

18:18.297 --> 18:22.199
What do you got? Huh?

18:22.234 --> 18:23.601
I got a lot of
countermeasures here.

18:23.636 --> 18:27.471
I got a lot of fail-safes,
I got a lot of decoy wires.

18:27.506 --> 18:29.473
I'm thinking
Abati's the only person

18:29.508 --> 18:31.175
who could defuse this bomb,
all right?

18:31.210 --> 18:32.676
Now, I could try
to disarm it,

18:32.711 --> 18:33.878
but if I make a mistake,

18:33.913 --> 18:36.180
I'm not just gonna kill
you and me,

18:36.215 --> 18:37.848
I'm gonna kill half
the population on this island.

18:37.883 --> 18:39.850
Okay, what's the good news?
Didn't say I had any good news.

18:39.885 --> 18:41.919
We got to contact
the bomb squad.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.053
By carrier pigeon?
I'm just curious,

18:43.089 --> 18:45.556
'cause I just told you
that my cell phone doesn't work

18:45.591 --> 18:47.858
and that thing clearly doesn't work...
I heard you, Danny,

18:47.893 --> 18:49.426
but, look, we have a truck,
all right?

18:49.461 --> 18:51.195
And the bomb is already
loaded on the truck.

18:51.230 --> 18:53.230
All we need to do
is drive it to the drop zone.

18:53.265 --> 18:55.666
We get to that clearing,
we have cell service.

18:55.701 --> 18:58.235
Okay? We're gonna take
a shortcut

18:58.270 --> 19:00.404
so we can get there
before this timer runs out.

19:00.439 --> 19:02.406
And in the meantime,
every cop on the Island

19:02.441 --> 19:04.241
is looking for Abati, no?

19:04.276 --> 19:06.677
So, hopefully, hopefully,
he's in custody by the time

19:06.712 --> 19:08.245
we get to the clearing.

19:08.280 --> 19:11.215
If not... hopefully,
somebody from the bomb squad

19:11.250 --> 19:13.684
can talk us through how
to deactivate this thing, okay?

19:13.719 --> 19:17.588
Just so I'm clear,
you want to drive a truck

19:17.623 --> 19:19.857
with a dirty bomb
made out of uranium

19:19.892 --> 19:21.892
and TATP--
which you personally told me

19:21.927 --> 19:23.827
was the most
unstable explosive

19:23.862 --> 19:26.664
on the planet Earth--
you want to drive that

19:26.699 --> 19:28.232
through the jungle...

19:28.267 --> 19:32.836
through this jungle,
on-on, at best, uneven terrain.

19:32.871 --> 19:35.706
That's... is that...
that's what you've come up with?

19:35.741 --> 19:38.309
We're gonna drive real slow.

19:39.345 --> 19:41.345
Find the keys.

19:45.384 --> 19:46.884
(exhales)

19:48.721 --> 19:52.256
(door slams)
Don't slam it!

19:52.291 --> 19:53.657
(door closes gently)

19:53.692 --> 19:54.959
(sighs)

19:56.595 --> 19:59.297
(inserts key into ignition)
(sighs)

20:00.966 --> 20:03.201
What?

20:06.038 --> 20:08.305
If this doesn't
work, I just...

20:08.340 --> 20:09.707
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:09.742 --> 20:11.942
Don't... don't...
don't say that.

20:11.977 --> 20:13.377
Don't say anything, okay?

20:13.412 --> 20:15.512
I don't need to hear it, okay?
I'm just saying,

20:15.547 --> 20:17.681
all right, this
is an old truck,

20:17.716 --> 20:19.984
it's gonna vibrate once the
engine's turned over, all right?

20:20.019 --> 20:22.519
I didn't need
to hear that, Steve.

20:22.554 --> 20:25.522
I didn't need that
in my life.

20:25.557 --> 20:28.025
Okay? Just start
the truck, please.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.493
Carefully.

20:29.528 --> 20:30.695
Okay.

20:31.930 --> 20:33.397
(gear shifts)

20:33.432 --> 20:34.966
(breathes deeply)

20:37.903 --> 20:39.537
I love you, bro.

20:41.340 --> 20:43.841
(ignition grinding)
(pumping pedal)

20:46.512 --> 20:48.912
(engine starts)

20:48.947 --> 20:50.948
(exhales)

20:54.386 --> 20:56.454
(clears throat)
- (exhales)

21:07.800 --> 21:09.700
Everything okay, sir?

21:09.735 --> 21:12.036
Uh, yeah. I just lost
control of my car.

21:12.071 --> 21:14.872
Ran right off the road
into a ditch over here.

Okay, all-all right.

I just want to make sure
that you don't go over a ditch

You know what it's gonna say

22:24.143 --> 22:26.410
Yeah, I do. It's gonna say

beloved curmudgeon."

22:27.680 --> 22:30.481
That's funny. No. It's gonna
say, "Here lies Danny Williams.

22:30.516 --> 22:31.749
"We think.

22:31.784 --> 22:34.651
We're not really sure because
we could not find all of him."

22:34.686 --> 22:36.687
Danny, I'm keeping it under
eight miles an hour, here.

22:36.722 --> 22:38.088
All right?
- It's not a school zone.

22:38.123 --> 22:39.990
I'm not worried
about getting a ticket.

22:40.025 --> 22:41.925
Dude, if I go
any slower,

22:41.960 --> 22:43.594
inertia is not gonna
be on our side,

22:43.629 --> 22:45.129
and these bumps are gonna
get a whole lot worse,

22:45.164 --> 22:46.530
and you know what
that means, okay?

22:46.565 --> 22:48.665
If I don't maintain
this speed,

22:48.700 --> 22:50.667
we're not gonna make it
to the clearing in time.

22:50.702 --> 22:51.668
How we doing on bars?

22:51.703 --> 22:52.836
Do you not think
that if I had bars

22:52.871 --> 22:54.638
I would inform you
of that, huh?

22:54.673 --> 22:56.106
No. You know what? Do you not think
that that's what I would do?

22:56.141 --> 22:56.973
You know what?

22:57.009 --> 23:01.011
We need to stop,
we need to calm down.

23:01.046 --> 23:03.547
We need to talk about something
else and distract ourselves.

23:03.582 --> 23:04.648
That's what we need to do.

23:04.683 --> 23:06.884
Ah. I-I couldn't imagine
what you'd want to talk about.

23:06.919 --> 23:08.118
Oh, actually,
you know what?

23:08.153 --> 23:09.753
Just explain something
to me, all right?

23:09.788 --> 23:11.455
You've never mentioned
retirement ever, ever, ever

23:11.490 --> 23:12.623
since I've known you.

23:12.658 --> 23:14.892
Now it's lists
and it's plans

23:14.927 --> 23:17.060
and restaurants, you know.
Why? Why?

23:17.095 --> 23:18.762
Where's it coming from?
I told you.

23:18.797 --> 23:19.930
I'm coming up on 20 years.

23:19.965 --> 23:22.466
So what? So what?
So what?

23:22.501 --> 23:23.734
Doesn't mean you have to retire.
- Okay, okay.

23:23.769 --> 23:25.569
It's not mandatory.
Why is it on the table?

23:25.604 --> 23:28.105
Okay. Grace got an assignment
at school, all right?

23:28.140 --> 23:30.107
Her guidance counselor
told her to write a list

23:30.142 --> 23:32.576
of all the things that
she would like to do in life,

23:32.611 --> 23:33.877
and that she should pursue
one of them.

23:33.912 --> 23:35.078
So it got me thinking,
all right?

23:35.113 --> 23:37.781
Then I-I decided
to make my own list.

23:37.816 --> 23:39.950
And as I made my own list,
I started to think some more,

23:39.985 --> 23:41.685
and I started to think
about Charlie.

23:41.720 --> 23:42.986
What about Charlie?

23:43.021 --> 23:44.688
Well, the guy thinks
that I am a superhero, okay?

23:44.723 --> 23:45.756
And that I'm indestructible.

23:45.791 --> 23:46.924
Guess what--
I'm not indestructible,

23:46.959 --> 23:47.992
but he doesn't know that yet.

23:48.027 --> 23:49.927
Soon he will know that,
just like Grace found out.

23:49.962 --> 23:51.728
Right? And he's
gonna get worried.

23:51.763 --> 23:53.697
Every time I put my gun
in my belt,

23:53.732 --> 23:54.765
he's gonna be worried about me.

23:54.800 --> 23:56.667
And I can save him
from that worry

23:56.702 --> 23:58.535
if I retire, okay?
Your father was a cop.

23:58.570 --> 24:00.737
You got worried about him, right?
(Steve taps on dashboard)

24:00.772 --> 24:01.839
What? What is that?

24:01.874 --> 24:02.873
We got a problem.

24:02.908 --> 24:04.208
I understand that.
What is it?

24:04.243 --> 24:05.843
Look at the fuel gauge.

24:08.747 --> 24:09.646
So what? We got enough
to get there.

24:09.682 --> 24:11.748
No, you don't understand--
this thing was

24:11.783 --> 24:13.717
three quarters
full when we left.

24:13.752 --> 24:15.886
I got to pull over.

24:21.860 --> 24:23.160
(grunts)

24:27.666 --> 24:28.866
All right.

24:28.901 --> 24:30.701
We got a hole
in the fuel line, all right?

24:30.736 --> 24:32.169
Looks like a bullet
must have ripped a hole in it.

24:32.204 --> 24:33.270
I got to fix it.

24:33.305 --> 24:35.272
Okay, good.
How you gonna do that?

24:35.307 --> 24:38.208
There's a repair kit
under my front seat; I saw it.

24:38.243 --> 24:40.010
It's gonna have
a couple of flares in it.

24:40.045 --> 24:41.745
Grab those, grab one of
the rubber floor mats as well.

24:41.780 --> 24:42.846
Bring them out here.

24:42.881 --> 24:45.115
Wait a minute. What are you
gonna do with a flare?

24:45.150 --> 24:46.650
I'm just curious.

24:46.685 --> 24:48.185
I'm gonna melt
some of the rubber floor mat

24:48.220 --> 24:49.553
over the hole in the rubber hose

24:49.588 --> 24:50.787
and it should seal it,
all right?

24:50.822 --> 24:51.988
It should be easy to fix.
Oh, good.

24:52.023 --> 24:55.058
Good. You're gonna use a flare,
fire, underneath the bomb.

24:55.093 --> 24:56.727
Is that--
I just want to make sure

24:56.762 --> 24:57.861
that that's what you're saying?

24:57.896 --> 24:59.663
That's a very good point, okay?

24:59.698 --> 25:01.598
Thank you. Why don't you
go find a big piece

25:01.633 --> 25:03.734
of wet tree bark, I'm gonna--
you're gonna hold it for me.

25:03.769 --> 25:05.235
You're gonna hold it
between the fuel line

25:05.270 --> 25:06.670
and the undercarriage
of the truck.

25:06.705 --> 25:07.838
It should insulate the heat.

25:09.341 --> 25:11.842
Come on, man.

25:13.011 --> 25:14.578
<i>One, two, three.</i>

25:14.613 --> 25:16.213
(flare sizzling)

25:16.248 --> 25:17.848
All right.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

25:17.883 --> 25:19.750
Just-just a reminder.
I know you know this,

25:19.785 --> 25:20.984
but gasoline's
flammable, okay?

25:21.020 --> 25:23.820
All right, the engine's off;
there's no gas in the fuel line.

25:23.855 --> 25:24.821
There's no ga...
where'd you take shop?

25:24.856 --> 25:26.089
I mean, there's always
gas in the fuel line,

25:26.124 --> 25:27.223
unless you do a complete flush.
What's the matter with you?

25:27.259 --> 25:29.292
Fine. You want to nitpick?
There's a couple of drops

25:29.327 --> 25:30.293
in the fuel line. How about that?
Well, yeah.

25:30.328 --> 25:31.895
I kind of like to nitpick,
'cause it's my life.

25:31.930 --> 25:32.963
So I'm gonna nitpick
a little bit, okay?

25:32.998 --> 25:34.264
Okay, look.
We should be all right.

25:34.299 --> 25:36.166
Don't say "should,"
don't say "should."

25:36.201 --> 25:37.901
It's uncertain, it's
not a good verb, okay?

25:37.936 --> 25:39.770
I'm hoping for the best
here, Danny.

25:39.805 --> 25:40.771
Don't hope.

25:40.806 --> 25:42.773
Ju... Just stop talking.

25:42.808 --> 25:44.908
Well, you trust me
a little bit, then.

25:44.943 --> 25:46.944
Tell me you're not
gonna miss this.

25:46.979 --> 25:49.012
Really?

25:49.047 --> 25:50.213
GROVER: Hey.
CHIN (over speakers): Yeah, Lou.

25:50.248 --> 25:52.849
I just found out a little
while ago that a guy matching

25:52.884 --> 25:55.652
Abati's description
jacked a police car

25:55.687 --> 25:56.620
a little while ago.

25:56.655 --> 25:58.589
He shot the officer
and left him for dead

25:58.624 --> 25:59.923
on the side of the road.

25:59.958 --> 26:01.858
I'm trying to track
the cruiser now.

26:01.893 --> 26:03.360
What about Steve
and Danny?

26:03.395 --> 26:04.795
Any word from them?

26:04.830 --> 26:06.163
No. No word,
and they're not picking up

26:06.198 --> 26:07.664
their satphone, either.

26:07.699 --> 26:10.000
All right. Keep trying.

26:24.950 --> 26:26.984
All right,
we got a problem.

26:27.019 --> 26:28.852
What now?

26:28.887 --> 26:31.154
My cell's down to 30%.
Where are you at?

26:31.189 --> 26:33.791
I don't think
it's gonna matter-- look.

26:41.099 --> 26:43.100
What are you doing?

26:44.903 --> 26:45.903
Don't sl... slam it.

27:02.254 --> 27:03.153
It's too deep.

27:03.189 --> 27:05.922
All right, uh...
we don't have a lot of time.

27:05.957 --> 27:07.924
Maybe, maybe we find
another place to cross, huh?

27:07.959 --> 27:10.027
No. We're gonna use,
we're gonna use the boards

27:10.062 --> 27:12.363
on the back of the truck and
we're gonna build a bridge.

27:14.266 --> 27:16.433
Can I ask you a question?

27:16.468 --> 27:18.969
Do you, do you take into account
that I'm here, too?

27:19.004 --> 27:20.804
Do I have a say
in anything we do?

27:20.839 --> 27:22.973
Or you just make decisions
all by yourself?

27:23.008 --> 27:24.675
Oh, that's rich coming from you.

27:24.710 --> 27:27.077
Wh-What do you
mean by that?

27:27.112 --> 27:28.745
What do I mean by that?

27:28.780 --> 27:30.080
You didn't feel the need
to include me

27:30.115 --> 27:31.682
in your decision to retire.

27:31.717 --> 27:33.817
It's my retirement.
Why would I include you

27:33.852 --> 27:36.453
in something like that?
It's got nothing to do with you.

27:36.488 --> 27:37.988
I don't know, Danny.

27:38.023 --> 27:41.291
(groaning):
Maybe...

27:41.326 --> 27:44.261
Maybe...
Easy.

27:44.296 --> 27:45.929
...because it's a big decision
that affects me, too.

27:45.964 --> 27:48.765
Did you think
about that? Huh?

27:48.800 --> 27:50.467
I mean, you want
to talk about trust.

27:50.502 --> 27:53.003
Well, I...

27:53.038 --> 27:56.006
trust you to bring me in
on big decisions like that.

27:56.041 --> 27:58.275
And quite frankly, it hurts
my feelings when you don't.

27:58.310 --> 27:59.843
Oh, you have feelings?
Well, you know what?

27:59.878 --> 28:01.078
It hurts my feelings
when you roll your eyes

28:01.113 --> 28:02.879
when I tell you
I want to make a restaurant.

28:02.914 --> 28:03.880
That hurts my feelings.

28:03.915 --> 28:05.115
Okay, let me ask you a question.

28:05.150 --> 28:06.717
If you were still married
to Rachel,

28:06.752 --> 28:07.918
and you made a decision
like this,

28:07.953 --> 28:09.219
a big decision
that affected her,

28:09.254 --> 28:10.453
how would she feel
if you didn't tell her about it?

28:10.489 --> 28:13.390
Are you comparing my failed
marriage to our relationship?

28:13.425 --> 28:15.325
Are you gonna answer
the question?

28:15.360 --> 28:17.327
She'd be upset.

28:17.362 --> 28:18.962
Thank you.

28:18.997 --> 28:20.464
Okay, grab this.

28:24.469 --> 28:26.336
Grab the thing.

28:26.371 --> 28:27.871
Thank you.

28:30.075 --> 28:30.974
(tires screeching)

28:48.460 --> 28:50.393
Looks like he ran a name.

28:50.428 --> 28:52.129
(typing)

28:54.933 --> 28:57.134
Oh, my God.

28:57.169 --> 28:58.368
Come on! (laughs)

28:58.403 --> 28:59.937
(man talking over TV)

29:01.239 --> 29:03.039
Oh, he got the fish!
He got the fish!

29:03.074 --> 29:04.908
(knocking on door)

29:04.943 --> 29:07.978
(groans) Where's the fire, huh?

29:08.013 --> 29:09.980
Oh, go get that big fish.

29:10.015 --> 29:10.981
(knock on door)

29:11.016 --> 29:12.816
Ah.

29:12.851 --> 29:13.817
Yeah?

29:13.852 --> 29:15.819
(grunts)

29:15.854 --> 29:16.754
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

29:18.023 --> 29:20.056
(groaning)

29:20.091 --> 29:22.192
Nice to see you again,
too, huh?

29:22.227 --> 29:23.360
So you gonna
introduce yourself,

29:23.395 --> 29:25.395
or you gonna just
go straight to the part

29:25.430 --> 29:27.097
where you try to kill me?

29:27.132 --> 29:29.900
You got me on this island,
now you're gonna get me off.

29:29.935 --> 29:31.301
(chuckles)

29:31.336 --> 29:34.004
Okay. All right, man.

29:34.039 --> 29:36.473
You know, this, uh,
slice of paradise

29:36.508 --> 29:38.175
isn't for everyone, you know?

29:38.210 --> 29:39.576
The heat, the traffic.

29:39.611 --> 29:42.179
But a good exfil

29:42.214 --> 29:45.916
takes patience, planning,
you know, financing.

29:45.951 --> 29:48.919
I cannot just snap my fingers
and make it happen, huh?

29:48.954 --> 29:50.954
(grunts)

29:52.357 --> 29:54.591
Like I was saying...

29:54.626 --> 29:56.593
you want a boat or plane?

29:56.628 --> 29:58.262
Whatever's faster.

30:01.366 --> 30:04.367
(grunts)

30:04.402 --> 30:05.869
(groans):
Okay.

30:05.904 --> 30:08.005
(sighs)

30:11.109 --> 30:12.943
That's good. You drive.

30:12.978 --> 30:14.077
Oh, now I get to drive?

30:14.113 --> 30:16.246
Yeah, yeah, I got to guide you
on the thing, all right?

30:16.281 --> 30:18.148
So you don't fall off.

30:19.951 --> 30:21.118
Let's go, let's go.

30:25.657 --> 30:27.024
(engine starts)

30:28.894 --> 30:30.260
All right,
to your right a little bit.

30:33.265 --> 30:35.999
(boards creaking)

30:36.034 --> 30:37.301
Good, come to me.

30:39.671 --> 30:42.105
Okay. Good.

30:42.140 --> 30:44.140
Move it that way.
Yeah, right there.

30:44.175 --> 30:46.343
Right there.
Keep coming.

30:46.378 --> 30:48.145
(board creaking)

30:53.919 --> 30:55.919
(board snapping)

30:57.155 --> 30:58.555
What's going on?
What's going on?

31:02.294 --> 31:04.561
Oh, we're good.
We're good, buddy.

31:04.596 --> 31:06.196
You got to keep coming.

31:06.231 --> 31:08.231
Give me a second.
Just give me a second.

31:08.266 --> 31:10.267
We're good. We're good.

31:10.302 --> 31:12.235
You got to keep coming, Danny.

31:12.270 --> 31:14.104
Danny, listen to me.

31:14.139 --> 31:16.172
It's gonna be all right.

31:16.207 --> 31:17.340
Okay.

31:17.375 --> 31:18.408
You got to keep
moving, Danny.

31:18.443 --> 31:19.910
You got to keep moving.
Keep moving.

31:20.712 --> 31:22.212
Come on, come on!
(board snapping)

31:22.247 --> 31:24.581
Come on! Go, Danny, go!

31:24.616 --> 31:26.516
(board snapping)

31:26.551 --> 31:28.318
Come on!

31:29.321 --> 31:30.921
Come on!

31:38.530 --> 31:40.297
Good job, buddy.

That's your ride, man.

31:49.207 --> 31:51.341
We take that
to Hawaii Island,

31:51.376 --> 31:53.576
and you got, uh, you know,
you got the jump seat

31:53.611 --> 31:56.246
on a cargo plane to Asia.

31:56.281 --> 31:58.949
Is it always this quiet
around here, man?

31:58.984 --> 32:01.618
Oh, you know, that's, uh, that's
why I picked it, you know.

32:01.653 --> 32:04.454
You trying to keep a
low profile, right?

32:04.489 --> 32:06.189

32:06.224 --> 32:07.223
Come on out.

32:07.258 --> 32:09.226
Come out right now
or I kill him.

32:10.295 --> 32:13.263
Five-O! Abati,
drop the weapon.

32:13.298 --> 32:14.464
Drop the weapon!

32:14.499 --> 32:16.266
Come any closer,
I'll kill him.

32:16.301 --> 32:17.500
Then kill him.

32:17.535 --> 32:19.703
We're not gonna stand down
for a convicted felon.

32:40.358 --> 32:42.425
No.

32:42.460 --> 32:44.261
Hold on, hold on.

32:46.264 --> 32:48.098

Let's go.

32:48.133 --> 32:49.099

32:49.134 --> 32:51.234
Dial Chin. Please.

33:01.746 --> 33:03.346
CHIN: Steve, where are you?
Hey, Chin, listen.

33:03.381 --> 33:04.681
We're at the drop zone.

33:04.716 --> 33:06.216
Danny and I are currently

33:06.251 --> 33:07.517
standing next to
an active dirty bomb

33:07.552 --> 33:10.020
that's set to go off in
less than ten minutes.

33:10.055 --> 33:12.489
Abati built this thing, he
could tell us how to defuse it.

33:12.524 --> 33:14.557
Please tell me you
have him in custody.

33:14.592 --> 33:17.127
We have him, Steve.

33:17.162 --> 33:18.161
But Abati's dead.

33:34.279 --> 33:36.312
You ever see
anything like this?

33:36.347 --> 33:38.415
AUKAI: No. And while there are
ways to defuse it,

33:38.450 --> 33:40.350
I wouldn't try any of them
in the field.

33:40.385 --> 33:41.518
And certainly not
without equipment.

33:41.553 --> 33:42.752
STEVE: Okay, so what
you're saying is

33:42.787 --> 33:44.721
this thing's going
off, is that right?

33:44.756 --> 33:48.425
Yes. But there may be a way
you can minimize the damage.

33:48.460 --> 33:51.194
If you can remove the uranium
canister from the device

33:51.229 --> 33:52.595
and get yourselves

33:52.630 --> 33:54.664
outside of the blast radius
before it detonates,

33:54.699 --> 33:55.632
then you'll be okay.

33:55.667 --> 33:57.734
Okay, so you're saying
that we can remove that

33:57.769 --> 34:01.237
without-without
setting off this bomb?

34:01.272 --> 34:03.239
Yes. But there is another issue.

34:03.274 --> 34:06.676
That canister holding
the uranium is lead-lined.

34:06.711 --> 34:08.344
Right now it's protecting you.

34:08.379 --> 34:10.580
It's the only thing protecting
you from the radiation.

34:10.615 --> 34:12.415
The problem is, if you try to...

34:12.450 --> 34:14.818
Yeah, we got, we got to remove
the uranium from the canister

34:14.853 --> 34:18.154
to get to the screws that are
holding the canister in place.

34:18.189 --> 34:19.322
Your guy was smart.

34:19.357 --> 34:20.590
To unscrew the canister,

34:20.625 --> 34:22.592
you first have to remove
the uranium rods.

34:22.627 --> 34:25.462
Once the canister is off,
then you can put them back in

34:25.497 --> 34:26.596
and close it up again.

34:26.632 --> 34:28.832
Hold, hold. How long do we have
before we are microwaved

34:28.867 --> 34:30.700
while doing that?
Not long. It's gonna be fast.

34:30.735 --> 34:32.702
I got an idea. Grab the phone.

34:32.737 --> 34:34.237
Grab the phone.

34:38.643 --> 34:40.444
All right, hold on.

34:41.779 --> 34:43.813
Car batteries
are made of lead, right?

34:43.848 --> 34:44.647
What's going on?

34:44.682 --> 34:46.649
Wh-What are you doing?
Look, the lead

34:46.684 --> 34:48.852
in the car battery
can protect me from the uranium,

34:48.887 --> 34:50.787
like the bib you get
in the dentist's office

34:50.822 --> 34:52.789
before he does an X-ray,
you understand?

34:52.824 --> 34:53.890
Uh-huh.

34:53.925 --> 34:55.792

to risk exposure.

34:55.827 --> 34:58.394

isn't a two-man job.

- No.

34:59.898 --> 35:02.765

we're both screwed anyway.

I'm a control freak.
