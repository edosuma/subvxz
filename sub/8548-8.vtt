WEBVTT

00:03.371 --> 00:05.206
BYE, MOM.
SEE YOU AFTER SCHOOL.

00:05.273 --> 00:08.008
HAVE A GOOD DAY, BABY.

00:08.076 --> 00:10.711
HI, GUYS.

00:10.778 --> 00:13.714
WELL, THERE GOES ANY CHANCE OF
HAVING A GOOD DAY.

00:13.781 --> 00:16.750
LAURA, ON YOUR WAY OUT,
CAN YOU TAKE OUT TRASH, PLEASE?

00:16.817 --> 00:18.286
OH, NO!

00:20.020 --> 00:21.955
HANDS AS DELICATE AS LAURA'S

00:22.022 --> 00:24.558
SHOULD NEVER
HAVE TO TOUCH GARBAGE.

00:31.799 --> 00:33.267
IT'S OKAY.

00:33.834 --> 00:35.303
IT'S OKAY.

00:38.806 --> 00:40.608
DID I DO THAT?

00:51.485 --> 00:55.289
* IT'S A RARE CONDITION
IN THIS DAY AND AGE *

00:55.356 --> 00:58.592
* TO READ ANY GOOD NEWS
ON THE NEWSPAPER PAGE *

00:58.659 --> 01:02.062
* AND LOVE AND TRADITION
OF THE GRAND DESIGN *

01:02.130 --> 01:06.467
* SOME PEOPLE SAY
IS EVEN HARDER TO FIND *

01:06.534 --> 01:09.637
* WELL, THEN, THERE MUST BE
SOME MAGIC CLUE *

01:09.703 --> 01:13.774
* INSIDE THESE GENTLE WALLS *

01:13.841 --> 01:17.478
* 'CAUSE ALL I SEE
IS A TOWER OF DREAMS *

01:17.545 --> 01:22.416
* REAL LOVE BURSTIN'
OUT OF EVERY SEAM *

01:22.483 --> 01:25.386
* AS DAYS GO BY *

01:25.453 --> 01:29.457
* WE'RE GONNA FILL OUR HOUSE
WITH HAPPINESS *

01:29.523 --> 01:32.326
* THE MOON MAY CRY *

01:32.393 --> 01:36.096
* WE'RE GONNA SMOTHER
THE BLUES WITH TENDERNESS *

01:36.164 --> 01:39.567
* AS DAYS GO BY *

01:39.633 --> 01:42.870
* THERE'S ROOM FOR YOU
ROOM FOR ME *

01:42.936 --> 01:47.141
* FOR GENTLE HEARTS
AN OPPORTUNITY *

01:47.208 --> 01:50.344
* AS DAYS GO BY *

01:50.411 --> 01:55.149
* IT'S THE BIGGER LOVE
OF THE FAMILY *

02:06.494 --> 02:07.261
HI, HONEY.

02:07.328 --> 02:09.363
MORNING, MOM.

02:09.430 --> 02:10.998
WHAT DOES EVERYONE
WANT FOR BREAKFAST?

02:11.064 --> 02:12.566
PANCAKES.
FRENCH TOAST.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.768
HOW ABOUT PIZZA?

02:14.835 --> 02:16.170
HOW ABOUT THIS?

02:16.237 --> 02:18.272
WE'RE HAVING EGGS,
AND YOU GOT TWO CHOICES--

02:18.339 --> 02:20.574
SCRAMBLED OR RAW.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.476
SCRAMBLED.
SCRAMBLED. SCRAMBLED.

02:23.911 --> 02:24.845
GOOD MORNING,
EVERYONE.

02:24.912 --> 02:26.146
GOOD MORNING,
DAD.

02:26.214 --> 02:27.581
YOU WANT SOME EGGS?

02:27.648 --> 02:31.852
NO. I GOT UP EARLY, SHOWERED,
AND HAD A BIG BREAKFAST.

02:31.919 --> 02:35.489
OH. MMM.

02:35.556 --> 02:36.590
AT LEAST
YOU SHOWERED.

02:36.657 --> 02:38.259
NOBODY ELSE
CAN GET IN THERE.

02:38.326 --> 02:40.361
IS MY MOTHER
STILL IN THE SHOWER?

02:40.428 --> 02:42.162
SHE'LL MISS HER TRAIN
TO MILWAUKEE.

02:42.230 --> 02:43.564
SHE'S ALMOST FINISHED.

02:43.631 --> 02:47.067
SHE WAS SINGING
STORMY WEATHER'S LAST VERSE.

02:47.134 --> 02:48.869
I'M NEXT.
I'M NEXT.

02:48.936 --> 02:52.473
YOU'RE LITTLE.
YOU CAN WASH IN THE SINK.

02:52.540 --> 02:53.874
GOOD MORNING,
EVERYONE.

02:53.941 --> 02:55.843
GOOD MORNING,
RAE.

02:55.909 --> 02:59.046
FABULOUS NEWS.

02:59.112 --> 03:01.482
LITTLE RICHIE JUST SPOKE
HIS FIRST WORD.

03:01.549 --> 03:04.385
YOU KIDDING.
WHAT DID HE SAY?

03:05.619 --> 03:07.421
MA-MA.

03:08.889 --> 03:10.123
AW.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.292
WAIT A MINUTE,
RACHEL.

03:11.359 --> 03:13.661
HE'S ONLY 9 MONTHS OLD.
ARE YOU SURE?

03:13.727 --> 03:19.600
I WAS THERE.
HE LOOKED RIGHT IN MY FACE
AND SAID, "MA-MA."

03:19.667 --> 03:22.570
WHY IS EVERY KID'S
FIRST WORD ALWAYS MAMA?

03:22.636 --> 03:26.206
NOT EDDIE.
HIS FIRST WORD WAS "HUH?"

03:27.341 --> 03:30.644
COME ON, HONEY.
SAY MA-MA.

03:30.711 --> 03:34.748
COME ON, SWEETHEART.
SAY MA-MA.

03:34.815 --> 03:36.250
MAMA.

03:36.317 --> 03:39.052
YOU SEE?
DO IT AGAIN.

03:39.119 --> 03:40.388
HONEY, DO IT AGAIN.

03:40.454 --> 03:42.923
I'M NOT IN THE MOOD.

03:46.494 --> 03:48.195
CUT IT OUT, CARL.

03:48.262 --> 03:50.331
HE REALLY
CAN SAY IT.

03:50.398 --> 03:52.199
* CAN'T GO ON *

03:52.266 --> 03:54.468
* EVERYTHING
I'VE GOT IS GONE *

03:54.535 --> 03:56.537
* STORMY WEATHER *

03:56.604 --> 03:58.639
GOOD MORNING,
EVERYONE.

03:58.706 --> 04:01.208
SHOWER'S FREE!

04:01.275 --> 04:03.311
SAY GOODBYE
TO YOUR GRANDMOTHER.

04:03.377 --> 04:04.345
BYE, GRANDMA!
BYE, GRANDMA!

04:04.412 --> 04:05.879
BYE, HONEY.
I'M FIRST!

04:05.946 --> 04:08.382
GET OUT OF THE WAY!

04:08.449 --> 04:09.883
MOTHER WINSLOW,
GUESS WHAT.

04:09.950 --> 04:11.084
WHAT?

04:11.151 --> 04:13.354
LITTLE RICHIE SPOKE
HIS FIRST WORD.

04:13.421 --> 04:16.657
OH, THAT'S SWEET.
WHAT DID HE SAY?

04:16.724 --> 04:18.025
MA-MA.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.127
AW, THAT'S CUTE.

04:20.193 --> 04:23.364
CARL'S FIRST WORD
WAS DOUGHNUT.

04:26.400 --> 04:29.670
MAMA, YOU'VE GOT
A TRAIN TO CATCH.

04:29.737 --> 04:31.839
HOW LONG YOU STAYING AT
FRANK'S AND MAXINE'S?

04:31.905 --> 04:34.675
10 DAYS, AND I'M LOOKING
FORWARD TO IT.

04:34.742 --> 04:38.011
AT FRANK'S, I HAVE MY OWN
BATHROOM AND SHOWER.

04:38.078 --> 04:42.650
YEAH, BUT THAT CHEAPSKATE
MAKES YOU RENT YOUR TOWELS.

04:42.716 --> 04:45.353
CARL'S BROTHER
HAS THREE BATHROOMS.

04:45.419 --> 04:48.722
THEY ALL HAVE SHOWERS--
AND ONE WITH A HOT TUB.

04:48.789 --> 04:49.757
CAN WE GO?

04:49.823 --> 04:51.191
AND A WHIRLPOOL.

04:51.258 --> 04:53.260
MAMA, I'M A COP.

04:53.327 --> 04:54.862
FRANK MAKES
MORE MONEY.

04:54.928 --> 04:56.497
HE'S
A CARPET SALESMAN.

04:56.564 --> 04:59.132
YOU SHOULD SEE
THEIR RUGS, HONEY.

04:59.199 --> 05:01.869
ESPECIALLY THE ONE
ON HIS HEAD.

05:01.935 --> 05:03.637
CAN WE GO?

05:03.704 --> 05:05.339
SAY BYE-BYE.

05:05.406 --> 05:07.475
SAY BYE-BYE.

05:07.541 --> 05:10.110
SAY BYE-BYE,
GRANDMA.

05:10.177 --> 05:11.379
OKAY, HONEY.

05:11.445 --> 05:14.014
WHEN HE'S READY,
HAVE HIM CALL ME.

05:22.856 --> 05:23.691
HEY, DUMPLIN'.

05:23.757 --> 05:25.893
HI, BABY. YOUR MAMA
GET OFF OKAY?

05:25.959 --> 05:27.395
RIGHT ON TIME.

05:27.461 --> 05:29.863
HARRIETTE, ALL THE WAY
TO THE STATION,

05:29.930 --> 05:33.333
ALL MY MOTHER COULD TALK
ABOUT WAS FRANK'S BATHROOMS.

05:33.401 --> 05:35.369
I TOLD HER THAT
WHEN SHE COMES BACK,

05:35.436 --> 05:37.538
THERE WILL BE A SHOWER
IN HER BATHROOM.

05:37.605 --> 05:39.640
AND SHE WON'T HAVE TO
RENT THE TOWELS.

05:39.707 --> 05:41.675
I'M GONNA GET STARTED
ON IT RIGHT AWAY.

05:41.742 --> 05:44.845
HOLD IT. HOLD IT.
WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE.

05:44.912 --> 05:47.280
I SHOULD HAVE GONE
TO THE STATION WITH YOU.

05:47.347 --> 05:48.549
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

05:48.616 --> 05:50.818
HARRIET,
WE NEED ANOTHER SHOWER.

05:50.884 --> 05:52.453
I CAN WORK
NIGHTS AND WEEKENDS,

05:52.520 --> 05:55.589
AND I'LL BE DONE
WHEN MAMA COMES BACK.

05:55.656 --> 05:57.425
WAIT A MINUTE, CARL.

05:57.491 --> 06:00.994
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT DOING THIS
YOURSELF, ARE YOU?

06:06.199 --> 06:07.568
AND WHY NOT?

06:07.635 --> 06:10.771
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT YOU RIPPING
UP THE HOUSE,

06:10.838 --> 06:14.307
AND FORCING THE WHOLE
FAMILY TO MOVE INTO A HOTEL.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.610
I ONLY DID THAT ONCE.

06:18.879 --> 06:23.417
AND THAT WAS BEFORE I JOINED
THE TOOL OF THE MONTH CLUB.

06:23.484 --> 06:26.754
HARRIETTE, I HAPPEN TO BE
VERY GOOD WITH MY HANDS.

06:26.820 --> 06:29.289
I BUILT THAT SWING SET
FOR THE KIDS, REMEMBER?

06:29.356 --> 06:30.791
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

06:30.858 --> 06:34.895
YOU BOUGHT THE WOOD,
WHICH IS STILL IN THE GARAGE.

06:34.962 --> 06:36.163
WHO PUT UP THE SHELF?

06:36.229 --> 06:38.198
I DID.

06:38.265 --> 06:40.501
OKAY.

06:40.568 --> 06:42.102
WHO BUILT
THAT BIRDHOUSE?

06:42.169 --> 06:46.139
YOU MEAN THE ONE CONDEMNED
BY THE AUDUBON SOCIETY?

06:46.206 --> 06:48.509
OKAY. BAD EXAMPLE.

06:48.576 --> 06:50.944
I'M TALKING BATHROOM FIXTURES
HERE, HARRIETTE.

06:51.011 --> 06:53.113
NOWADAYS, THESE SHOWERS
COME IN KITS.

06:53.180 --> 06:56.784
A MERE CHILD
COULD DO IT.

06:56.850 --> 06:58.552
HONEY.

06:58.619 --> 07:00.688
I KNOW YOU MEAN WELL,

07:00.754 --> 07:02.756
BUT PLUMBING IS
WAY OUTTA YOUR LEAGUE.

07:02.823 --> 07:05.425
WE OUGHT TO GET AN ESTIMATE
FROM A CONTRACTOR.

07:05.493 --> 07:07.495
A CONTRACTOR?

07:07.561 --> 07:08.929
NOW, THAT'S
AN INSULT,

07:08.996 --> 07:11.499
AND IT'S JUST
THROWING AWAY MONEY.

07:11.565 --> 07:13.133
WHAT'S BURNING?

07:13.200 --> 07:14.835
THE TOASTER'S
BROKEN AGAIN.

07:14.902 --> 07:17.137
THAT'S THE LAST THING
YOU FIXED.

07:17.204 --> 07:19.139
I DID FIX IT.

07:26.580 --> 07:28.215
JUST LIKE NEW.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.230
OKAY. ONE ESTIMATE.

07:48.401 --> 07:50.638
SO, HOW SOON
YOU NEED THE SHOWER?

07:50.704 --> 07:52.773
IT HAS TO DONE
WITHIN TEN DAYS.

07:52.840 --> 07:55.408
IT'S A PRESENT
FOR MY MOTHER.

07:55.475 --> 07:58.512
I ALWAYS GIVE
MY MOTHER A BOOK.

07:58.579 --> 08:01.715
WHY DON'T I GET US SOMETHING
COLD TO DRINK.

08:01.782 --> 08:03.684
LET'S SEE--
ME AND MY CREW,

08:03.751 --> 08:06.219
FIGURE IN
A LITTLE OVERHEAD.

08:06.286 --> 08:08.255
YEAH. THERE.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.223
THERE'S THE DAMAGE.

08:10.290 --> 08:12.593
WHOA!

08:13.326 --> 08:15.295
SYLVIA.

08:15.362 --> 08:16.363
OOH.

08:16.429 --> 08:18.198
YOU KNOW,

08:18.265 --> 08:19.833
I'M REAL BAD
AT BARGAINING,

08:19.900 --> 08:22.903
SO LET ME JUST ASK YOU
STRAIGHT OUT--

08:22.970 --> 08:24.872
ARE YOU CRAZY?

08:24.938 --> 08:27.507
LISTEN, MR. WINSLOW,
I'M DOING THE BEST I CAN.

08:27.575 --> 08:29.409
I'M GIVING YOU
MATERIALS AT COST.

08:29.476 --> 08:33.681
BUT THIS IS
WAY, WAY, WAY MORE

08:33.747 --> 08:35.082
THAN I WANTED
TO SPEND.

08:35.148 --> 08:38.318
YOU'LL NEVER GET ANYBODY
TO DO IT FOR LESS THAN THAT.

08:38.385 --> 08:40.487
OH, WELL...

08:40.554 --> 08:42.222
THANK YOU
FOR YOUR TIME SYLVIA,

08:42.289 --> 08:43.724
BUT I THINK I WILL.

08:43.791 --> 08:46.226
I'LL JUST
DO IT MYSELF.

08:46.293 --> 08:47.561
LET ME GUESS.

08:47.628 --> 08:52.099
YOU'RE A MEMBER OF THE TOOL
OF THE MONTH CLUB.

08:52.165 --> 08:54.735
WELL, YEAH.

08:54.802 --> 08:58.038
I THOUGHT SO.
I'LL BE SEEING YOU SOON.

09:09.316 --> 09:13.654
HAVE I TOLD YOU HOW PRETTY
YOUR HAIR LOOKS TODAY?

09:13.721 --> 09:16.056
WHERE'S SYLVIA?

09:16.123 --> 09:18.091
I LET HER GO.
I'LL CATCH HER.

09:18.158 --> 09:20.628
NOW, HARRIETTE,
SHE'S LONG GONE NOW.

09:20.694 --> 09:22.596
SHE JUST WANTED
WAY TOO MUCH MONEY.

09:22.663 --> 09:24.264
I DECIDED
TO DO THIS MYSELF.

09:24.331 --> 09:27.334
CARL, YOU DON'T
HAVE A CLUE HOW TO PUT IN A
SHOWER .

09:27.400 --> 09:30.604
HARRIET, ALL YOU DO IS
RIP OUT YOUR LINEN CLOSET,

09:30.671 --> 09:32.105
RUN YOUR PIPES,
INSTALL YOUR LINES,

09:32.172 --> 09:36.777
AND POP YOUR SHOWER IN.
NOW, WHAT COULD BE SIMPLER?

09:36.844 --> 09:39.479
YOU HIRE SYLVIA.
CARL, I ASKED AROUND.

09:39.546 --> 09:42.783
SHE'S VERY GOOD, AND YOU
CAN'T FIND ANYBODY CHEAPER.

09:42.850 --> 09:46.019
HARRIETTE, I'M GOOD,
AND I'M FREE.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.656
NOW, HONEY, I REALLY
WANT TO DO THIS MYSELF.

09:48.722 --> 09:51.258
CARL, HOW CAN YOU
DO THIS YOURSELF?

09:51.324 --> 09:53.160
SYLVIA WORKS
WITH A CREW.

09:53.226 --> 09:54.561
HI.

09:54.628 --> 09:56.797
MEET MY CREW.

09:56.864 --> 09:58.465
EDWARD, GUESS WHAT.

09:58.531 --> 10:00.701
YOU'RE GOING TO HELP ME
PUT IN A SHOWER

10:00.768 --> 10:03.370
IN YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S
BATHROOM.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.505
OH, NO.

10:05.572 --> 10:09.677
IS THIS GOING TO BE LIKE THE
TIME WE PUT UP THE SPICE RACK?

10:09.743 --> 10:12.145
NO. THIS WILL ONLY
TAKE A WEEK.

10:21.789 --> 10:24.357
TESTING. 1, 2.

10:24.424 --> 10:26.126
OKAY, RICHIE,
WE'RE ROLLING.

10:26.193 --> 10:28.561
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU NEED
THAT TAPE RECORDER.

10:28.628 --> 10:31.264
ALL HE DOES IS DROOL.

10:31.331 --> 10:33.366
THIS IS AN
HISTORIC MOMENT.

10:33.433 --> 10:34.735
WE'LL ALL
LISTEN TO THIS

10:34.802 --> 10:38.906
WHEN RICHIE IS ALL GROWN UP
AND PRESIDENT.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.640
COME ON,
SWEETHEART.

10:40.708 --> 10:42.843
SAY MA-MA.

10:44.444 --> 10:46.847
MA-MA.

10:46.914 --> 10:49.282
MAYBE HE'LL BE
VICE PRESIDENT.

10:51.584 --> 10:52.753
EASE YOUR END
IN THERE.

10:52.820 --> 10:55.055
WATCH YOURSELF.
WATCH THE DOOR.

10:55.122 --> 10:58.759
EASE IT IN.
THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT.

10:58.826 --> 11:01.962
WAIT A MINUTE. THE RUG'S CAUGHT.
BACK UP A LITTLE BIT.

11:07.334 --> 11:08.802
TOO MUCH.

11:11.038 --> 11:13.406
[CLANG]

11:13.473 --> 11:17.845
YOU GUYS AREN'T GONNA BE WORKING
ANYWHERE NEAR MY ROOM, ARE YOU?

11:18.779 --> 11:20.714
COME ON.

11:22.615 --> 11:25.652
OH, EDDIE,
GUESS WHAT.

11:25.719 --> 11:27.187
LORI MARTIN CALLED.

11:27.254 --> 11:30.657
SHE WANTED TO KNOW IF YOU COULD
MEET HER AT THE ROLLER RINK.

11:30.724 --> 11:32.659
LORI MARTIN
CALLED ME?

11:32.726 --> 11:34.061
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

11:34.127 --> 11:37.097
I TOLD HER THAT YOU WERE
GONNA BE IN THE BATHROOM

11:37.164 --> 11:39.366
FOR A WEEK.

11:42.169 --> 11:45.038
WHY AM I ALWAYS THE ONE
WHO HAS TO HELP?

11:45.105 --> 11:47.808
BECAUSE, SON, WE'RE THE MEN
IN THIS HOUSE.

11:47.875 --> 11:51.411
AND WORKING WITH OUR HANDS
IS WHAT MEN DO.

11:53.313 --> 11:55.315
WELL, WHAT DO WOMEN DO?

11:59.652 --> 12:01.822
I DON'T KNOW, SON.

12:05.793 --> 12:06.927
HOW'S IT GOING?

12:06.994 --> 12:10.063
GREAT. WE'RE READY
TO RIP OUT THIS WALL.

12:10.130 --> 12:12.165
CARL, I THINK WE SHOULD CALL
THE CONTRACTOR.

12:12.232 --> 12:15.302
CALL HER. MAYBE SHE
CAN LEARN SOMETHING.

12:15.368 --> 12:17.004
RIGHT, EDDIE?

12:23.743 --> 12:25.312
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE US,
HARRIETTE,

12:25.378 --> 12:29.482
WE MEN HAVE SOME SERIOUS
SHOWER INSTALLING TO DO.

12:32.652 --> 12:33.753
OH, OKAY, CARL.

12:33.821 --> 12:34.888
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING,

12:34.955 --> 12:36.990
WE WOMENFOLK WILL BE
CHURNING BUTTER

12:37.057 --> 12:39.192
AND TENDING
THE YOUNG'UNS.

12:41.795 --> 12:42.863
OKAY, SON,

12:42.930 --> 12:44.832
LET'S GET
THIS PUPPY STARTED.

12:44.898 --> 12:46.867
NOW, WE GOT TO FIND
THE STUD BEAM

12:46.934 --> 12:49.436
AND WORK FROM THERE.

12:49.502 --> 12:50.838
HOLLOW.

12:51.338 --> 12:52.906
HOLLOW.

12:52.973 --> 12:55.142
HOLLOW.
THERE SHE IS.

12:55.208 --> 12:57.077
HAND ME A NAIL.
I'LL MARK IT.

12:57.144 --> 13:00.280
OH, HERE.
PUT THESE ON.

13:00.347 --> 13:01.114
WHY?

13:01.181 --> 13:04.885
REMEMBER, SON,
SAFETY FIRST.

13:08.155 --> 13:09.222
OOH! OW!

13:09.289 --> 13:11.591
OW!

13:11.658 --> 13:14.862
OH! OH! OW! OW!

13:25.038 --> 13:27.875

AND WHO DO YOU LOVE?
MA-MA.

14:13.987 --> 14:18.858
AND WHO LOVES YOU?
MA-MA.

14:18.926 --> 14:22.462
RACHEL, HE'S A BABY
NOT A PARROT.

14:22.529 --> 14:25.332
HE SAID IT A FEW DAYS AGO
CLEAR AS A BELL.

14:25.398 --> 14:29.869
BABIES SAY WORDS AND WEEKS WILL
GO BY BEFORE THEY SAY IT AGAIN.

14:29.937 --> 14:34.474
RACHEL, IT'S POSSIBLE HE BURPED
AND YOU THOUGHT HE SAID MAMA.

14:38.946 --> 14:40.413
CARL, HE SAID, MAMA.

14:40.480 --> 14:43.316
I'M GONNA PUT IT ON TAPE
AND PROVE IT TO EVERYBODY.

14:43.383 --> 14:46.386
COME ON, RICHIE. WE'LL BREAK
THIS DOWN INTO SYLLABLES.

14:46.453 --> 14:50.457
MA! NOW, SAY THAT TWICE
AND YOU GOT IT.

14:53.060 --> 14:55.996
CARL, WHEN CAN I
SEE THE BATHROOM?

14:56.063 --> 14:58.999
NOT YET, NOT YET.
STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS.

14:59.066 --> 15:02.469
EDDIE AND I DON'T WANT ANYBODY
TO SEE IT UNTIL IT'S FINISHED.

15:02.535 --> 15:04.337
[TELEPHONE RINGS]

15:04.837 --> 15:06.239
[RING]

15:06.306 --> 15:07.440
HELLO.

15:07.507 --> 15:09.242
OH, HI, MOTHER WINSLOW.

15:09.309 --> 15:11.211
HOW'S FRANK?

15:11.278 --> 15:14.314
WELL, I KNOW HE'S CHEAP.

15:14.381 --> 15:15.515
OKAY.

15:15.582 --> 15:16.649
THANKS FOR CALLING.

15:16.716 --> 15:18.651
BYE.

15:18.718 --> 15:20.287
DIDN'T SHE WANT
TO TALK TO ME?

15:20.353 --> 15:24.324
SHE WAS CALLING FROM THE PAY
PHONE IN FRANK'S KITCHEN.

15:24.391 --> 15:27.260
SHE'LL TALK TO YOU TOMORROW
NIGHT WHEN SHE GETS HOME.

15:27.327 --> 15:30.563
TOMORROW NIGHT? SHE'S SUPPOSED
TO BE GONE ANOTHER FOUR DAYS.

15:30.630 --> 15:32.599
SAYS SHE CAN'T STAND
ANOTHER DAY WITH FRANK.

15:32.665 --> 15:34.634
EVERY TIME HE TAKES HER OUT
TO RESTAURANTS,

15:34.701 --> 15:38.171
HE MAKES HER
ORDER FROM THE CHILDREN'S MENU.

15:38.871 --> 15:40.707
TOMORROW NIGHT?

15:40.773 --> 15:41.808
GOOD NIGHT, EVERYONE.

15:41.874 --> 15:44.877
WHOA. WHOA.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

15:44.944 --> 15:46.279
OUT?

15:48.081 --> 15:50.150
NO. YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S
COMING HOME TOMORROW.

15:50.217 --> 15:52.385
WE HAVE TO FINISH
THAT SHOWER TONIGHT.

15:52.452 --> 15:53.553
DAD, I MADE PLANS.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.855
WELL, I'M SORRY.
YOUR PLANS HAVE CHANGED.

15:55.922 --> 15:56.889
OH, DAD.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.291
OW!

16:09.602 --> 16:12.805
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU WERE ALMOST FINISHED.

16:12.872 --> 16:15.308
I AM.
THE HARD PART'S DONE.

16:15.375 --> 16:17.210
EVERYTHING ELSE
IS COSMETIC.

16:17.277 --> 16:19.012
THIS DOESN'T NEED
COSMETICS.

16:19.079 --> 16:21.581
IT NEEDS
MAJOR SURGERY.

16:21.648 --> 16:25.552
THIS IS WORSE THAN THE TIME DAD
PUT UP THE SPICE RACK.

16:25.618 --> 16:29.089
MOM, DOES THIS MEAN
WE GET TO GO TO A HOTEL AGAIN?

16:29.156 --> 16:31.291
NO. GIRLS, COULD YOU
LEAVE US ALONE, PLEASE?

16:31.358 --> 16:34.227
LET'S PACK OUR BAGS,
JUST IN CASE.

16:35.895 --> 16:38.131
EDDIE, I NEED
TO TALK TO YOUR DAD.

16:38.198 --> 16:39.932
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A BREAK?

16:39.999 --> 16:41.568
THANKS, MOM.

16:43.103 --> 16:46.039
I WON'T
FORGET THIS.

16:48.041 --> 16:49.609
CARL, THIS HAS GONE
FAR ENOUGH.

16:49.676 --> 16:52.479
I WANT YOU TO GIVE IT UP
AND CALL A CONTRACTOR.

16:52.545 --> 16:55.548
HARRIET, I CAN FINISH THIS.
I'M SO CLOSE.

16:55.615 --> 16:58.385
THE PLUMBING IS ALL DONE,
AND THAT'S THE HARD PART.

16:58.451 --> 16:59.819
YOU MEAN
THE SHOWER'S WORKING?

16:59.886 --> 17:02.789
ABSOLUTELY.
I'LL SHOW YOU.

17:08.061 --> 17:10.930
I DON'T GET IT.
I DID EVERYTHING RIGHT.

17:10.997 --> 17:12.532
CARL.

17:12.599 --> 17:15.001
CARL, THERE'S WATER
COMING FROM THE SINK.

17:15.068 --> 17:17.670
TURN IT OFF.

17:18.905 --> 17:20.540
I SAID TURN IT OFF!

17:20.607 --> 17:21.674
I DID.

17:21.741 --> 17:23.743
WELL, TURN IT BACK ON!

17:31.718 --> 17:33.686
IT'S JUST THE PIPES
FLUSHING THEMSELVES OUT.

17:33.753 --> 17:36.022
IT SHOULD BE FINE NOW.

17:36.089 --> 17:37.524
MIND IF I
TRY SOMETHING?

17:37.590 --> 17:39.092
GO AHEAD.

17:43.363 --> 17:44.864
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:44.931 --> 17:46.199
NICE GOING, CARL.

17:46.266 --> 17:51.070
YOU HAVE TO WORK THE SHOWER
FROM THE SINK.

17:53.406 --> 17:55.875
I MUST HAVE CROSSED UP
THE PIPES SOMEWHERE.

17:55.942 --> 17:58.077
OH, NO PROBLEM.
IT'S FINE.

17:58.145 --> 18:00.980
YOU JUST CAN'T
SHOWER ALONE.

18:01.047 --> 18:02.949
HARRIET, THIS IS VERY EASY TO
FIX.

18:03.015 --> 18:05.385
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS
RIP OUT THE SHOWER,

18:05.452 --> 18:07.954
TEAR UP THE FLOOR,
RECONNECT SOME PIPES,

18:08.020 --> 18:12.024
SLAP ON DRYWALL, LAY SOME
TILE, GROUT IT AND TIDY UP.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.360
IT'S OVER, CARL.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.895
HARRIETTE, LOOK,
I KNOW THIS LOOKS BAD--

18:15.962 --> 18:17.297
LOOKS BAD?

18:17.364 --> 18:20.767
YOU'VE GOT TO TURN ON THE SHOWER
FROM THE SINK.

18:20.833 --> 18:25.037
HARRIETTE, I REALLY WANTED
TO DO THIS FOR MY MOTHER.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.406
LOOK AROUND.

18:26.473 --> 18:28.675
IT'S NOT
GOING TO HAPPEN.

18:30.577 --> 18:33.880
WELL, I MIGHT AS WELL
FACE IT.

18:33.946 --> 18:36.849
I'M NOT AS HANDY
AS I THINK I AM.

18:36.916 --> 18:39.419
OH, HONEY, IT'S OKAY.

18:39.486 --> 18:41.721
YOU'RE GOOD
AT SO MANY OTHER THINGS.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.022
YEAH, BUT, HONEY,

18:43.089 --> 18:46.326
BEING GOOD WITH YOUR HANDS
IS PART OF MAKES A MAN.

18:46.393 --> 18:49.196
BEING GOOD WITH YOUR HANDS
IS NOT WHAT MAKES A MAN.

18:49.262 --> 18:51.298
IT'S BEING GOOD
WITH YOUR HEART.

18:51.364 --> 18:57.036
AND WHEN IT COMES TO THAT,
YOU'RE ABOUT THE BEST THERE IS.

18:57.103 --> 18:59.606
THANK YOU, HONEY.
I NEEDED THAT.

18:59.672 --> 19:02.209
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO
ABOUT THIS MESS?

19:02.275 --> 19:06.012
WELL, WE CAN
EITHER CALL SYLVIA

19:06.078 --> 19:07.514
OR BOARD UP
THE ROOM.

19:07.580 --> 19:10.817
OH. FINE. WHAT AM I
GOING TO TELL HER,

19:10.883 --> 19:13.420
THAT I'M AN IDIOT?
THAT I DESTROYED MY BATHROOM?

19:13.486 --> 19:15.522
THAT I MADE
A FOOL OF MYSELF?

19:15.588 --> 19:18.525
OH, HONEY, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO TELL HER THAT.

19:18.591 --> 19:21.328
WHEN SHE SEES THIS,
SHE'LL KNOW.

19:35.675 --> 19:36.443
OH, HI, HONEY.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.211
HI,
MOTHER WINSLOW.

19:38.278 --> 19:40.747
I'M SORRY YOU DIDN'T HAVE A GOOD
TIME AT FRANK'S.

19:40.813 --> 19:43.850
HONEY, THE OLDER THAT MAN GETS,
THE CHEAPER HE GETS.

19:43.916 --> 19:46.486
THE OTHER NIGHT WE HAD
A FIGHT OVER DINNER.

19:46.553 --> 19:47.320
WHY?

19:47.387 --> 19:50.122
I WANTED SOME.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.659
OH. AM I GLAD
TO BE HOME.

19:52.725 --> 19:53.626
I'M EXHAUSTED.

19:53.693 --> 19:56.363
MAMA, I KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT YOU NEED--

19:56.429 --> 19:58.898
A NICE HOT SHOWER
IN YOUR OWN BATHROOM.

19:58.965 --> 20:02.702
NOW, CARL, DON'T TEASE
A TIRED, HUNGRY OLD LADY.

20:02.769 --> 20:05.238
DID YOU REALLY PUT
A SHOWER IN MY BATHROOM?

20:05.305 --> 20:07.039
I SAID I WOULD,
DIDN'T I?

20:07.106 --> 20:10.910
OH, I CAN HARDLY
WAIT TO SEE IT.

20:10.977 --> 20:12.745
BRING MY SUITCASE.

20:12.812 --> 20:14.180
YOU KNOW,

20:14.247 --> 20:17.450
I TOOK A BUNCH
OF FRANK'S TOWELS.

20:17.517 --> 20:20.420
KNOWING FRANK, THEY PROBABLY
WEREN'T HIS TO BEGIN WITH.

20:20.487 --> 20:24.724
THEN, THAT EXPLAINS WHY THEY SAY
HOWARD JOHNSON'S.

20:40.973 --> 20:42.475
OH...

20:42.542 --> 20:45.678
CARL, HARRIETTE,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.647
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.

20:47.714 --> 20:50.683
I HAVE TO ADMIT
IT CAME OUT PRETTY NICE.

20:50.750 --> 20:54.053
CARL, I NEVER REALIZED
YOU WERE THIS HANDY.

20:54.120 --> 20:55.221
IT LOOKS
PROFESSIONAL.

20:55.288 --> 20:58.325
WELL, THANK YOU, MAMA.
IT IS.

20:58.391 --> 21:00.493
YOU MEAN YOU DIDN'T
DO IT YOURSELF?

21:00.560 --> 21:03.396
NO, MOTHER WINSLOW.
WE HIRED A CONTRACTOR.

21:03.463 --> 21:04.831
OH, I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT.

21:04.897 --> 21:08.267
ONLY A FOOL
WOULD MESS WITH PLUMBING.

21:08.335 --> 21:09.502
YOU'RE RIGHT, MAMA.

21:09.569 --> 21:11.270
YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A TIME

21:11.338 --> 21:12.739
WHEN CARL WAS PIGHEADED ENOUGH

21:12.805 --> 21:15.875
TO TRY TO DO THIS
ALL BY HIMSELF.

21:15.942 --> 21:19.779
WELL, THAT WAS
A LONG TIME AGO, MAMA.

21:19.846 --> 21:22.915
OH, HARRIETTE, CARL,

21:22.982 --> 21:25.117
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

21:25.184 --> 21:26.252
I LOVE YOU.

21:26.319 --> 21:28.321
WELL, I THINK I'LL
TAKE A SHOWER NOW.

21:28.388 --> 21:29.356
ENJOY, MAMA.

21:29.422 --> 21:31.290
GOD BLESS.

[SINGING
STORMY WEATHER]

21:43.736 --> 21:45.805

LIKE SHE LIKES IT.

21:45.872 --> 21:47.974
I THINK
SHE'S PROUD OF YOU, CARL.

21:48.040 --> 21:50.009
COME ON,
I'LL MAKE YOU A MILKSHAKE.

HAS SOMETHING TO SAY.

22:16.603 --> 22:18.004
HE ALREADY SPOKE.

22:18.070 --> 22:21.073
AND WHEN HE SPEAKS AGAIN,
I'M GOING TO BE READY.

22:21.140 --> 22:23.376
OH, NO.
I NEED NEW BATTERIES.
