WEBVTT

03:12.642 --> 03:16.011
Excuse me, buddy. You speak English?

03:17.898 --> 03:19.891
Yeah, like a native.

03:19.942 --> 03:22.480
I'm looking for a Mr Thomas Magnum.

03:22.528 --> 03:24.854
- He's inside.
- Much obliged.

03:24.906 --> 03:29.699
- You can't go in. It's for members only.
- It's important. I got to talk to Mr Magnum.

03:31.705 --> 03:36.284
You heard Teoki.
Members only. Sorry about that.

03:37.378 --> 03:39.454
You and me both, partner.

03:48.849 --> 03:50.925
Excuse me.

03:55.982 --> 03:59.850
$100?
TC, I agreed to pay you $100 an hour.

03:59.903 --> 04:02.229
But we were only up for 15 minutes.

04:02.281 --> 04:06.860
No, no, no. You agreed to pay me
$100 an hour, or any part thereof.

04:06.911 --> 04:11.787
'Any part thereof'?
I never said 'any part thereof.'

04:11.833 --> 04:14.040
It's my standard agreement.

04:15.087 --> 04:19.298
- Excuse me. Are you Mr Magnum?
- Yeah.

04:19.341 --> 04:22.545
You don't look like a private eye.

04:24.138 --> 04:28.137
- Private investigator.
- My name's Billy Joe Little.

04:28.185 --> 04:32.135
I want to hire you to help me
find my little sister, Carol Ann.

04:34.650 --> 04:37.355
That's him. Right over there.

04:42.284 --> 04:45.487
You come along quietly now.
We don't want any more trouble.

04:45.537 --> 04:48.871
Rick, I'm having
a private conversation with him.

04:48.916 --> 04:51.834
Have it in the street.
This guy busted Harland's jaw.

04:51.878 --> 04:54.630
He got in my way.

04:54.673 --> 04:58.089
- Cowpoke, get out.
-  Just a minute...

04:58.135 --> 05:01.089
- Where I come from, a man...
- Billy Joel

05:01.138 --> 05:03.297
Why don't you and I just mosey on outside

05:03.349 --> 05:06.220
and we can talk about this
under the wide open sky?

05:06.269 --> 05:08.345
Come on, pal.

05:12.150 --> 05:15.686
And, you, don't come in here
dressed again like that.

05:24.581 --> 05:26.657
That's your car?

05:33.174 --> 05:37.006
You listen to me.
I was all buttercups and daisies in there

05:37.053 --> 05:41.182
but those are my friends and I don't like
getting them in trouble because of me.

05:41.224 --> 05:45.389
Harland's a nice guy. You can't go around
busting people in the jaw.

05:45.438 --> 05:47.929
- They wouldn't let me in.
- Phone me.

05:47.982 --> 05:51.102
- I didn't have your number.
- Look it up.

05:54.406 --> 05:56.565
Give me my picture.

06:00.079 --> 06:02.155
Thank you.

06:03.750 --> 06:06.039
What's the 'S' stand for?

06:07.963 --> 06:10.205
Shamrock.

06:10.257 --> 06:14.670
Shamrock, Texas.
That's where we're from, Carol Ann and me.

06:14.720 --> 06:19.715
She's a cheerleader in our high school.
She's just about everything.

06:19.768 --> 06:24.975
She's got a pretty voice. Used to sing
the national anthem before football games.

06:25.023 --> 06:28.642
She wanted to be a singer.
That's why she came out here.

06:28.694 --> 06:33.357
She was doing good, singing in clubs,
sending money to Mama and Daddy.

06:33.408 --> 06:36.777
She even said one of the nightclubs
had a sign that said

06:36.828 --> 06:40.992
her name held over by popular demand.
It was really something.

06:41.041 --> 06:44.874
We didn't know where Hawaii was.
Here she was, a big hit.

06:44.921 --> 06:47.044
What happened?

06:47.090 --> 06:52.844
Well...her letters
started kinda sounding sad.

06:53.972 --> 06:57.757
It wasn't exactly in the words.
It was more in between.

06:57.810 --> 07:02.354
Then one day she wrote
she was coming home. Just like that.

07:02.398 --> 07:04.937
And that is the last we heard from her.

07:04.985 --> 07:07.856
How long ago was that?

07:07.905 --> 07:10.657
About two months ago.

07:10.699 --> 07:12.776
I went to the police.

07:12.827 --> 07:17.074
They said all they could do
is just take her name and put it on a list.

07:17.123 --> 07:19.081
After going to the Federales,

07:19.125 --> 07:23.337
I figured it was time
for a little Texas-style action.

07:23.380 --> 07:25.706
And here I am.

07:26.759 --> 07:28.835
But, Magnum,

07:30.263 --> 07:32.339
I don't know where to start.

07:32.390 --> 07:35.557
And that's why I came looking for you.

07:38.814 --> 07:42.433
OK. I'll tell you what.

07:42.485 --> 07:45.688
I'll give it a try.
But we're gonna do it my way.

07:46.614 --> 07:50.150
That's fine with me. Thank you.

07:50.786 --> 07:54.072
'Billy Joe knew a bar
where Carol Ann had worked.

07:54.123 --> 07:58.251
'He forgot to tell me
he'd already made contact with the owner.'

07:58.294 --> 08:02.873
Get out of here, cowboy,
before I blow you out of here.

08:02.924 --> 08:05.213
That's what you said last time, bubba.

08:05.260 --> 08:10.053
Why don't you just wait in the car
so that I can talk to this gentleman?

08:10.099 --> 08:12.306
Go onl

08:24.281 --> 08:28.825
- How's the nose? ls it broken?
- I don't think so. Just sore like me.

08:28.870 --> 08:31.788
What did you do
to make him punch you, anyway?

08:31.832 --> 08:37.075
He was looking for his sister. It's been two
years, and we get a lot of dollies in here.

08:37.129 --> 08:41.590
He showed me her picture,
and I remember her. What a lousy singer.

08:41.634 --> 08:45.798
- What she did to Cole Porter was criminal.
- That's why he hit you?

08:45.847 --> 08:50.889
No. I told him his sister was coming on to
any guy that could move her career.

08:50.936 --> 08:54.353
- Then he hit me.
- You said that about his sister?

08:54.398 --> 08:58.266
- He asked. I can't hide the truth.
- What happened to her?

08:58.319 --> 09:01.985
Probably found herself a sugar daddy.
They usually do.

09:02.032 --> 09:06.161
Well, you got an address?
What's in your personnel file?

09:06.203 --> 09:09.952
Personnel file?
What am l, the Bank of America?

09:10.792 --> 09:15.869
lf she worked for you, you must have sent
her a W-2 form for her taxes.

09:15.922 --> 09:18.628
lf you didn't, I could probably get the lRS

09:18.676 --> 09:23.671
to supply you with the proper forms
for the last couple of years, or longer.

09:26.351 --> 09:29.886
Get out of here.
I got cash customers to take care of.

09:29.938 --> 09:34.067
Ain't no way I'm takin'
some crazy cowboy to Maui.

09:34.109 --> 09:36.945
I'm a cash customer.

09:36.988 --> 09:39.823
OK, so I'm a little short right now.

09:39.866 --> 09:42.737
But I'll pay you as soon as he pays me.

09:42.786 --> 09:46.535
I've heard that one before,
and I ain't buying it.

09:46.582 --> 09:49.868
TC, the man is looking
for his long-lost sister.

09:49.919 --> 09:52.754
What's that
compared to a few lousy bucks?

09:52.797 --> 09:55.882
A few lousy bucks?
More like $200 for gas and oil.

09:55.925 --> 09:59.259
Plus $100 for the business
I'd be losing, plus another...

09:59.304 --> 10:02.259
OK, a couple of hundred lousy bucks.

10:02.308 --> 10:06.970
What difference does it make?
Look, I got a terrible feeling about this case.

10:07.021 --> 10:11.066
Maybe his sister is into something
that he wouldn't want to know about.

10:11.109 --> 10:14.858
- That's why I got to get him out of the way.
- Like what?

10:14.905 --> 10:17.657
Like, maybe she's a hooker.

10:20.036 --> 10:22.444
- His sister?
- That's right.

10:22.497 --> 10:23.872
Oh...

10:23.915 --> 10:26.952
You know what that would do
to a guy like that?

10:27.002 --> 10:30.288
That's why if you take him to Maui
for a couple of hours,

10:30.339 --> 10:35.085
I can talk to his sister and get her
to clean up her act before he sees her.

10:35.136 --> 10:38.173
Yeah. OK.

10:39.599 --> 10:44.807
But this ain't no charitable run.
You're gonna have to pay for this.

10:44.855 --> 10:46.931
Of course I will.

10:49.151 --> 10:51.773
I told him that time.

11:13.011 --> 11:15.088
Sagare.

11:16.766 --> 11:20.716
Some of our people tell me
that Carol Ann's brother is in Honolulu

11:20.770 --> 11:23.143
and he's hired a detective to find her.

11:23.189 --> 11:25.942
- Who is this detective?
- Thomas Magnum.

11:25.984 --> 11:29.935
- ls he competent?
- Hard to tell. Not much known about him.

11:29.989 --> 11:32.445
- What has he found out?
- Nothing yet.

11:32.492 --> 11:38.447
I want it kept that way. Assign two
of your best men. This is to be first priority.

11:38.498 --> 11:40.575
And I want to be kept informed.

11:40.626 --> 11:42.702
Hai. Wakarimashita.

12:06.571 --> 12:09.572
'The bartender
turned out to be very helpful.

12:09.616 --> 12:14.528
'He had a file on Carol Ann but he needed
a little encouragement to show it to me.

12:16.916 --> 12:20.701
'Unfortunately, Carol Ann's address
only increased my suspicions.

12:20.754 --> 12:22.996
'You have to be
more than a lounge singer

12:23.048 --> 12:27.046
'to afford the 12th floor
of the Kahala Towers.'

13:25.451 --> 13:27.527
'I couldn't help admiring Carol Ann.

13:27.578 --> 13:33.119
'lf she'd gone into the oldest profession,
she'd at least done well for herself.

13:33.168 --> 13:36.371
'Everything from the stereo
to the view was class A.

13:36.422 --> 13:40.586
'Carol Ann had managed to come
a long way from Hotel Street.'

13:58.696 --> 14:03.692
'Hi, babe, sweet Louie here. Let's party.
Call the whipped cream lady, too.'

14:05.954 --> 14:10.997
'Hello. This is Dr Sarador. Ogatha and l
would like very much to see you.

14:11.043 --> 14:13.369
'Please bring the redhead...'

14:17.759 --> 14:20.677
Police officers. You're under arrest.

14:28.605 --> 14:31.226
Don't you think
the handcuffs are a bit much?

14:31.274 --> 14:33.314
Not when it comes to murder.

14:34.486 --> 14:36.479
Murder? Whose murder?

14:37.156 --> 14:38.864
Carol Ann Little.

14:42.912 --> 14:47.076
'Carol Ann's body
had been found in the Ala Wai Canal.

14:47.125 --> 14:49.202
'The police couldn't hold me.

14:49.253 --> 14:53.333
'I'd been in her apartment
but so had a hundred other guys.

14:53.382 --> 14:56.384
'And they weren't private investigators.

15:16.325 --> 15:21.071
'The thing that bothered me at the moment
was how I'd break the news to Billy Joe.

15:21.122 --> 15:25.452
'It's never easy, but I thought it would be
best if I stuck to the fact she was dead

15:25.502 --> 15:27.993
'and didn't elaborate.'

15:32.134 --> 15:37.010
- Did you have any luck?
- Nope.

15:37.056 --> 15:39.761
Me either.
It was an empty buildin' out there.

15:42.229 --> 15:45.146
- I know.
- You know?

15:45.190 --> 15:48.975
You know it was an empty building,
and you sent me over there anyway?

15:49.028 --> 15:51.436
Hold it. Hold it.

15:53.449 --> 15:57.115
- Carol Ann's dead.
- What?

16:00.958 --> 16:04.458
Somebody ran her down
while she was out jogging.

16:04.503 --> 16:08.336
The police are pretty sure it's murder.
I'm sorry.

16:10.677 --> 16:13.928
- How long ago?
- Two months.

16:32.326 --> 16:37.321
'The next two days were lost,
at least as far as Billy Joe was concerned.

16:37.373 --> 16:39.865
'After I explained about Carol Ann,

16:39.918 --> 16:44.746
'he went on the biggest drunk
the islands had seen since V-J Day.

16:44.798 --> 16:49.010
'I just stayed out of his way.
I figure I owed him something.'

17:45.491 --> 17:47.567
You OK?

17:49.829 --> 17:52.499
I want to find them, Magnum.

17:52.541 --> 17:54.747
- Billy Joe, you can't.
- Why not?

17:54.793 --> 17:58.874
- Because this isn't Dodge City.
- I cannot just do nothing

17:58.923 --> 18:04.878
when there's people out there that took
my sister and turned her into a...prostitute.

18:07.307 --> 18:11.056
- Where did you hear that?
- I saw the police reports.

18:11.103 --> 18:14.307
You knew it all the time, didn't you?

18:14.357 --> 18:19.150
Look, Billy Joe. She was alone,
broke and hungry. You really...

18:19.195 --> 18:23.407
- Don't say she did it on her own.
- I didn't say that.

18:23.450 --> 18:26.985
- I'm just saying it's possible.
- It ain't possible.

18:27.038 --> 18:32.281
Carol Ann wasn't the kind to do
those kind of things and I know that.

18:32.335 --> 18:35.289
I think we should let the police handle this.

18:35.338 --> 18:40.084
And the best thing we can do for you
is get you on a plane back to Texas.

18:43.806 --> 18:47.057
ls that what you would do
if it was your sister?

18:49.938 --> 18:56.309
The first thing you gotta do
is put the Gs back on your l-N-Gs.

18:56.362 --> 19:00.230
You know what I mean?
Otherwise, it won't wash.

19:00.283 --> 19:02.608
Did you hear me?

19:02.661 --> 19:07.288
I really am tryin'. But this goin' undercover is
a lot tougher than I thought.

19:07.332 --> 19:10.334
'Trying.' l-N-G.

19:14.173 --> 19:16.462
Eloha, pardner.

19:18.011 --> 19:20.087
Alohal

19:21.306 --> 19:23.180
'Eloha'l

19:43.373 --> 19:47.703
- All of them aren't...
- Some are, and some aren't.

19:47.753 --> 19:51.122
Now, look, just watch yourself.
Let me handle this.

19:51.173 --> 19:54.507
And remember, you're a local guy.

19:54.552 --> 19:58.253
Bartender, I would like
a Scotch on the rocks for myself

19:58.306 --> 19:59.966
and a Tom Collins for my friend.

20:00.016 --> 20:02.887
- You bet.
- Thank you.

20:02.936 --> 20:06.140
- ls anyone sitting here?
- No, but...

20:06.190 --> 20:08.646
- May I sit?
- We'd die if you didn't, darlin'.

20:08.693 --> 20:12.940
But I'll tell you,
this stool here is the worst one at the bar.

20:12.989 --> 20:16.405
- Why don't you sit on this one here?
- Thank you.

20:18.078 --> 20:20.652
There you go. Very nice.

20:20.706 --> 20:25.203
- My name is Judy.
- How'd you like to have a Tom Collins?

20:25.253 --> 20:29.465
- Thank you.
- Doctor, another one here.

20:30.133 --> 20:32.589
You're not from around here, are you?

20:32.636 --> 20:36.219
No, ma'am, I'm not.
I'm from what they call the outer islands.

20:36.265 --> 20:39.765
Southernmost part of the chain,
in case you detect an accent.

20:40.728 --> 20:44.098
Darlin', what about
we get down to brass tacks here?

20:44.149 --> 20:45.244
William?

20:48.028 --> 20:52.738
Could I see you for just a second?
Would you excuse us? Thank you.

20:52.784 --> 20:54.860
Excuse me, darlin'.

20:56.204 --> 20:58.874
- What?
- Listen to me.

20:58.915 --> 21:01.751
You remember when I said
some are and some aren't?

21:01.794 --> 21:03.703
- Yeah.
- Well, that one 'aren't.'

21:03.754 --> 21:07.966
I live here. I like it here.
I wanna keep on living here.

21:08.009 --> 21:10.049
Listen to mel

21:10.095 --> 21:13.179
Please, just be quiet. Let me handle it.

21:13.223 --> 21:17.684
- And remember, you're a local guy.
- Sorry. I just... I was sure.

21:17.728 --> 21:21.512
Don't worry about a thing,
I will smooth everything out.

21:23.651 --> 21:26.771
Darlin', I think there's somethin'
you should know.

21:26.822 --> 21:30.606
You see, you're not exactly
my buddy over here's type.

21:30.659 --> 21:32.866
Billy Joe.

21:32.912 --> 21:36.613
Maybe you ought to leave him alone.
What do you say, darlin'?

21:39.377 --> 21:42.581
- I had to do that. We got work to do.
- Will you shut up?

21:42.631 --> 21:45.632
Will you just let me handle this, please?

21:54.603 --> 21:57.141
'It took an hour
and three watered-down drinks

21:57.189 --> 21:59.146
'before we finally had another bite.

21:59.191 --> 22:03.521
'But at least this time,
it was the right kind of fish.'

22:03.571 --> 22:06.572
You look like two lonesome cowboys
around here

22:06.616 --> 22:09.321
so we thought we'd just mosey on in.

22:10.704 --> 22:14.369
And we're just plumb tickled to death
that you did, ma'am.

22:14.416 --> 22:17.418
Just sit yourself down,
you pretty little heifers.

22:17.461 --> 22:22.420
I'm Roy. And this here's my partner
in the oil business, Clarence.

22:22.467 --> 22:25.753
You can call me Billy Joe if you want to.
That's my nickname.

22:25.804 --> 22:30.882
- You're Texans.
- Yes, ma'am, and proud of it. You bet.

22:30.935 --> 22:33.058
I'm Lilly, and this is Mary.

22:33.104 --> 22:37.268
Now that we got that out of the way,
what do y'all want to drink?

22:37.317 --> 22:41.564
Let's don't waste your money. Why don't we
get some and take it back to your room?

22:41.613 --> 22:46.240
Now, hold on a second.
I am working up a powerful thirst.

22:46.285 --> 22:50.330
lf you want to keep us all night, it's OK,
but it's gonna cost you.

22:50.373 --> 22:52.864
Don't you worry your pretty little heads off.

22:52.918 --> 22:55.872
Money is one thing
there is plenty of, darlin'.

22:55.921 --> 23:01.877
Then maybe you'd show us some of that
money you Texans are so famous for.

23:01.928 --> 23:06.804
Darlin', you know us Texans cannot
talk business without a drink in our hand.

23:06.850 --> 23:09.056
I'm beginning to smell a setup.

23:09.102 --> 23:12.020
No, we just want to relax
and get to know you first.

23:12.064 --> 23:17.189
I'll level with you. My sister is in your line
of work. You might know her. Carol Ann.

23:17.236 --> 23:19.775
- What are you doing?
- I just knew it.

23:19.823 --> 23:23.737
This is important.
Somebody has murdered her.

23:23.785 --> 23:25.862
I've got a picture right here.

23:29.458 --> 23:33.504
I've seen her around.
She's worked around here before, I think.

23:33.546 --> 23:35.835
Yeah. About a year ago.

23:35.882 --> 23:39.583
Who'd she work for?
Who put her in here? How about you?

23:39.636 --> 23:43.337
We're not crazy.
lf we start talking, we'll end up just like her.

23:43.391 --> 23:45.680
- We've got to go.
- Hold on.

23:45.727 --> 23:49.262
- Please let go. I don't want any trouble.
- We just want a name.

23:49.314 --> 23:53.727
Please, just give us a name. Please.

23:53.777 --> 23:56.103
Ito-san.

24:07.292 --> 24:09.369
- You know this guy?
- Shhl

24:09.420 --> 24:12.504
Everybody does.
He's the Al Capone of Hawaii.

24:12.548 --> 24:16.381
He was deported years ago
but he got the deportment order squashed.

24:22.351 --> 24:25.186
- Naze? Doshite?
- Kocchi he Koi.

24:28.232 --> 24:31.483
We got them in this trouble.
We better do somethin'.

24:31.528 --> 24:33.853
Yeah.

24:39.119 --> 24:41.326
Hi, guysl

24:43.624 --> 24:46.032
- We don't want to go with you.
- What?

24:46.086 --> 24:49.870
We can't run, we work for them.
Please go away.

24:54.595 --> 24:56.173
Here.

24:58.516 --> 25:00.224
Go on, take him.

25:00.268 --> 25:03.637
- He's got a couple of little bitty sticks.
- Are you nuts?

25:07.985 --> 25:11.734
I don't suppose you care to discuss this?

25:29.884 --> 25:33.218
It's all right. Everything is going to be OK.

25:33.263 --> 25:35.933
Billy Joe, you all right?

25:58.208 --> 26:00.284
Are you all right?

26:02.546 --> 26:04.705
I've been better.

26:04.757 --> 26:07.628
- What was them things?
- They're nunchucks.

26:07.677 --> 26:11.805
They're deadly.
lf you had waited, I could've warned you.

26:11.848 --> 26:17.056
That's all right. We got our man.
His name is Mr... Oh... Sun.

26:17.104 --> 26:20.224
We got a name, that's about it.
And his name isn't Sun.

26:20.274 --> 26:23.525
It's Ito. It's a title that you put
at the end - san.

26:23.569 --> 26:26.143
It's form... Never mind.

26:26.197 --> 26:30.575
Whatever. You said he was a vice lord.
I say we go find him right now.

26:30.619 --> 26:34.202
There you go,
acting like John Wayne again.

26:34.248 --> 26:37.166
- Backin' out on me?
- I don't believe you.

26:37.210 --> 26:40.246
A name comes up
and you're ready to lynch him.

26:40.296 --> 26:43.048
You do what you want, I'm going to find him.

26:43.091 --> 26:46.258
- As soon as I go home and get my gun.
- What?

26:46.303 --> 26:51.511
Where? You got a gun? Where will you
find him? You don't know where to look.

26:51.559 --> 26:57.265
- I'll find him.
- Great. I swore I knocked that guy out.

26:57.315 --> 27:01.942
'I had a plan but it couldn't be carried out
with Billy Joe around.

27:01.987 --> 27:07.327
'I figured if I got to Higgins in his sleep,
he might be drowsy enough to help.

27:07.368 --> 27:11.366
'There was something in the air.
And it wasn't jasmine.'

27:11.414 --> 27:13.075
Ughl

27:32.313 --> 27:34.270
Magnum.

27:34.315 --> 27:36.474
What is it?

27:36.526 --> 27:39.646
- It's 6:37 in the morning.
- I know that, Higgins.

27:39.696 --> 27:42.816
But this is important. I need a big favour.

27:45.286 --> 27:48.536
Why do I feel like
the fly who walked into the spider's web?

27:48.581 --> 27:51.535
Nonsense. What is it you need?

27:53.920 --> 27:58.499
I need you to keep Joe here,
all day if you have to, till I get back.

27:58.550 --> 28:00.627
Consider it done.

28:01.887 --> 28:04.176
Just like that?

28:05.892 --> 28:07.351
No?

28:07.394 --> 28:10.597
As you may have noticed,
I've fired the grounds keeper.

28:10.647 --> 28:15.226
Until I can find a successor, I'd like you
to assume some of the responsibilities.

28:15.277 --> 28:20.154
- I don't know anything about gardening.
- The kind of work I have in mind

28:20.200 --> 28:23.403
requires no intelligence whatsoever.

28:23.453 --> 28:25.161
Like what?

28:25.205 --> 28:30.366
Like distributing 1 ,500 pounds of recycled
vegetation that was delivered yesterday.

28:30.419 --> 28:34.998
Recycled vegetation?
What do you mean? Recycled how?

28:35.049 --> 28:37.208
Through a cow.

28:39.680 --> 28:43.464
I always feel so much better after a shower.

28:43.517 --> 28:45.593
Magnum?

28:47.105 --> 28:48.979
Magnuml

28:55.322 --> 28:58.608
He must be out there
workin' on his suntan again.

29:00.703 --> 29:03.076
Magnuml

29:06.793 --> 29:08.537
Magnuml

30:38.187 --> 30:41.272
You already know who I am
and who I'm working for

30:41.315 --> 30:43.985
so let's just skip the preliminaries.

30:44.027 --> 30:46.399
You have five minutes.

30:46.446 --> 30:50.527
You killed Carol Ann Little
and we're going to nail you for it.

30:51.535 --> 30:56.198
Certainly, you have better things to do
with your time, Mr Magnum.

30:56.249 --> 31:01.326
Carol Ann Little was
nothing more than a common tramp.

31:02.214 --> 31:04.290
That's not true.

31:05.551 --> 31:10.213
- She was my client's sister.
- You may save me the sentimentality.

31:10.264 --> 31:14.263
She was greedy and ambitious, but lazy.

31:14.311 --> 31:17.312
Hardly a compatible combination.

31:17.356 --> 31:21.223
So she resorted to making money
the easy way.

31:21.277 --> 31:24.480
And you were only too glad to take a cut.

31:24.530 --> 31:27.448
You will not prove that.

31:27.492 --> 31:31.407
I already have proof.

31:31.455 --> 31:34.954
Proof she worked for you
and proof you killed her.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.326
This is Carol Ann's diary.

31:37.378 --> 31:40.000
It's fascinating, especially near the end.

31:40.048 --> 31:42.883
She was petrified
someone was going to kill her

31:42.926 --> 31:45.963
and she's quite clear as to who and why.

31:47.556 --> 31:49.964
Who would believe the word of a prostitute?

31:50.017 --> 31:54.311
Against a drug-pushing pimp?
A whole lot of people.

32:03.324 --> 32:06.610
How much do you want for it?

32:08.162 --> 32:10.784
What makes you think I want to sell?

32:10.832 --> 32:13.703
Why else would you come here?

32:13.752 --> 32:17.702
Well, we had considered it
if the money was right.

32:18.591 --> 32:23.300
To avoid the publicity
and a possible...trial,

32:23.346 --> 32:27.095
I'm willing to pay, say, $10,000.

32:27.142 --> 32:31.520
You'd pay more than that to your laers.
Say 50.

32:33.107 --> 32:36.690
- You play high stakes, Magnum.
- I got all the cards.

32:38.613 --> 32:44.070
Do you? Why don't I just kill you
and take the diary?

32:45.871 --> 32:50.617
You don't think I'd be stupid enough
to bring the real thing, do you?

32:53.671 --> 32:57.504
All right. 50,000.

32:58.427 --> 33:03.089
I have to talk it over with my client.
But I'll get back to you.

33:03.140 --> 33:06.806
lf you're as smart as I think you are,
Magnum

33:06.853 --> 33:11.599
you will be back here with the diary
in 24 hours.

33:24.372 --> 33:27.124
'My trip to Ito's had not been settling.

33:27.167 --> 33:30.287
'I came away pretty sure
he had killed Carol Ann.

33:30.337 --> 33:33.089
'Why else would he care about the diary?

33:33.132 --> 33:37.711
'I was also pretty sure
he'd try and kill me rather than pay for it.

33:37.762 --> 33:42.591
'You see, I have an uncanny knack
for painting myself into corners.'

34:08.880 --> 34:12.214
Do you mind taking me downtown
to the police station?

34:12.259 --> 34:15.177
I'd appreciate it if you'd handcuff me, too.

34:18.349 --> 34:21.101
You're some kind of wise guy.

35:15.163 --> 35:19.327
I'm getting a little tired
of the silent treatment.

35:19.376 --> 35:24.715
Your partner is waiting for me at the airport.
Are you gonna charge me or what?

35:25.966 --> 35:29.087
No one's charging you with anything.

35:29.137 --> 35:31.675
This trip is purely educational.

35:44.570 --> 35:49.150
Well, howdy, Mr Magnum.
I'm Carol Ann Little.

36:17.941 --> 36:21.310
Doggies, you out there?

36:21.362 --> 36:24.529
Come on in, doggies. Come on inl

36:34.042 --> 36:35.585
Bye-byel

37:17.405 --> 37:22.648
We had to pretend she was dead.
She's testifying for us against Ito.

37:23.138 --> 37:27.682
She witnessed the murder of two men.
One of them, Ito did it himself.

37:27.727 --> 37:31.641
We got him, Magnum - if we can
just keep you out of our way.

37:32.357 --> 37:36.355
Carol Ann is ready to testify.
She is our only witness and will testify.

37:36.987 --> 37:39.146
- Did he do this?
- Yeah.

37:42.368 --> 37:46.746
- I'm a friend of Billy Joe's.
- They told me about you.

37:48.291 --> 37:54.627
I guess I don't much resemble
the sweet thing my brother told you about.

37:57.093 --> 38:00.178
Yeah, Ito did it.

38:00.221 --> 38:03.922
Right after I told him
that I was leaving the islands.

38:03.976 --> 38:08.638
I'd been his mistress for a while,
so I know a lot about his business.

38:08.689 --> 38:14.775
Too much for him to let me go.
So he ran me down and left me for dead.

38:18.200 --> 38:21.616
Where's Billy Joe? I'd like to see him.

38:21.662 --> 38:24.782
He's at my place. I'll call him.

38:24.832 --> 38:29.993
How much does he know...
about me, I mean, and everything?

38:32.132 --> 38:36.629
- He knows everything, Carol.
- Oh, damn.

38:36.679 --> 38:40.428
Listen, he's just not so perfect himself.

38:40.475 --> 38:45.814
There are a dozen guys on the island
he hasn't punched or threatened to punch.

38:45.856 --> 38:51.099
That sounds like him.
That's my Pickles, all right.

38:51.100 --> 38:53.071
Pickles?

39:11.968 --> 39:15.053
- Yes, what is it?
- Higgins? ls that you?

39:15.097 --> 39:19.177
Your cowboy friend has escaped
and stolen the Ferrari.

39:19.226 --> 39:21.896
You were supposed to be watching him.

39:21.938 --> 39:26.814
I know.
Honour demands I take full responsibility.

39:26.860 --> 39:30.027
- 'And I do.'
- Bye, Higgins.

39:30.072 --> 39:32.397
I think Billy Joe's on his way to Ito's.

39:32.449 --> 39:37.112
- Get out an APB on that red Ferrari.
- You got it.

39:37.163 --> 39:42.288
Check the charter services.
Billy Joe knows Ito's place is on Maui.

39:42.335 --> 39:46.036
- That's where he's heading.
- Notifying them won't do any good.

39:46.089 --> 39:48.545
- He'll just take what he wants.
- What?

39:48.592 --> 39:51.712
Well, he can fly just about anything.

39:51.762 --> 39:55.808
He's a crop duster back home.
Didn't anybody tell you that?

39:57.227 --> 40:01.889
Carol Ann, Billy Joe is full of surprises.

40:31.807 --> 40:33.467
All right.

41:40.008 --> 41:42.678
That should be Magnum.

41:42.720 --> 41:44.629
You have your instructions.

41:44.680 --> 41:48.096
I make sure to get the diary
and then kill him.

41:48.893 --> 41:50.553
Ike.

42:26.185 --> 42:28.759
- Howdy.
- Oh!

43:08.524 --> 43:11.608
Hey ! Where is Ito?

43:11.652 --> 43:14.144
Lady, where is Ito-san?

43:24.124 --> 43:28.917
'Billy Joe had taken TC's chopper, which
wasn't gonna put me in real solid with TC.

43:28.963 --> 43:34.883
'What worried me even more
was Billy Joe's sense of frontier justice.

43:34.928 --> 43:38.179
'I just hoped we got there in time
to stop him.'

43:39.725 --> 43:43.011
Sayonara, darling.
Let's go for a little walk.

43:43.938 --> 43:46.180
Nanimono da?

43:49.319 --> 43:52.321
- Who are you?
- My name's Little.

43:52.364 --> 43:57.323
Billy Joe Bob Little.
And you have corrupted your last young girl.

43:57.370 --> 44:00.407
So you might as well go ahead
and say your prayers.

44:00.457 --> 44:02.200
I have no quarrel with you.

44:02.250 --> 44:05.999
I used to have a baby sister
called Carol Ann Little.

44:07.798 --> 44:13.220
She was so pretty. They used to say
she got all the looks in the family.

44:13.263 --> 44:16.098
They also used to say
I got all the mean.

44:34.453 --> 44:36.446
There he is.

44:36.497 --> 44:38.988
It's TC's chopper. He's there already.

45:26.720 --> 45:29.555
I have money. I'll make you rich.

45:29.598 --> 45:33.845
- Tell me all about it, pardner.
- I'll do anything.

45:36.314 --> 45:39.149
Billy Joel Don't do it.

45:39.192 --> 45:43.237
Magnum, get out of here now.
This is not your concern any more.

45:43.864 --> 45:46.735
Your sister's alive. She's alive.

45:46.784 --> 45:52.075
You see, she's alive.
Magnum, make him let me down.

45:52.123 --> 45:56.121
Don't try it.
I'm not gonna kill you cos I like you.

45:56.169 --> 45:59.503
But I can put a piece of lead in you
to slow you down.

45:59.548 --> 46:01.837
You can hang around, visit.

46:01.884 --> 46:05.253
It'll take me a minute
to pull this chair out from under Mr Ito.

46:05.304 --> 46:07.463
She's alive, I swear it.

46:07.515 --> 46:11.181
You tricked me before.
You think I'm some kind of a hick.

46:12.187 --> 46:14.263
Picklesl

46:14.314 --> 46:16.936
- Let him go, Pickles.
- Pickles.

46:24.951 --> 46:28.036
- Where is she, Magnum?
- She's OK, Billy.

46:28.080 --> 46:33.038
She's with the police and wants to see you.
They'll take you to her. It's over now.

46:56.445 --> 46:59.363
Higgins, what are you doing?

46:59.406 --> 47:04.199
We had an agreement. I didn't fulfil my part,
so I can't expect you to.

47:04.245 --> 47:09.952
- Therefore, I am spreading manure.
- But you hate that kind of work.

47:10.002 --> 47:15.626
The fertilizer must be distributed now
for the lawn to have sufficient nitrogen.

47:15.675 --> 47:22.129
Gee, I feel awful. Sure we had a deal,
but so what if you didn't keep up your end?

47:22.182 --> 47:24.424
We're still friends, aren't we?

47:24.476 --> 47:27.892
Look, I know this isn't your kind of work.

47:29.357 --> 47:34.233
Since you're in a hurry
and you're doing it for the lawn,

47:34.279 --> 47:37.814
I want you to know I'll be thinking
what a wonderful guy you are

47:37.866 --> 47:40.440
the whole time I'm swimming.
