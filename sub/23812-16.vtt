04:55.294 --> 04:57.046
if you don't know
how to make the cake?

04:57.130 --> 05:00.258

for the Armor of Astoria.

we are on...

05:33.249 --> 05:35.084
a special quest
from the Princess.

her singing is awful.

Someone important
that we respect?

10:58.491 --> 11:00.659

11:00.743 --> 11:02.244
who's important
and who we respect.

11:04.288 --> 11:06.374

She made the first move.

18:59.137 --> 19:00.472
- Go!

19:01.306 --> 19:03.475
- Well, I guess
it's time to sing.

19:03.559 --> 19:05.018
- Look, if this is
something you wanna do,

19:05.102 --> 19:06.103
you're not gonna
do it alone.

19:06.186 --> 19:07.604
I'll be right up
here with you.

19:07.688 --> 19:08.814
- I don't wanna do it.

19:08.897 --> 19:11.149
- I'm so happy you said that.
Now let's get outta here.

19:11.233 --> 19:13.443
- Hey, the entertainment's
running! Get 'em!

19:13.527 --> 19:14.862
Here we go!

19:14.945 --> 19:16.613
- [trumpet fanfare]

19:16.697 --> 19:18.198
- Oh, that's the cake horn!
Get ready!

19:22.327 --> 19:24.413
There it is--

19:24.496 --> 19:27.082
the 100-layer
Astorian King Cake.

19:27.165 --> 19:30.002
Oh, it looks just
like Eliza's.

19:30.085 --> 19:31.795
I call the first
99 layers.

19:33.338 --> 19:34.715
- A gift, Your Majesty,

19:34.798 --> 19:36.383
from the Princess
and the Phoenix Squad.

19:36.466 --> 19:39.136
- Oh, that's the squad with
the green shoulder thingies?

19:39.219 --> 19:41.346
I like them.

19:41.430 --> 19:43.056
- There's Jimbo!
- Back away from the cake!

19:43.140 --> 19:45.058
- Your Majesty,
they want your cake.

19:45.142 --> 19:46.268
- I no longer
like the squad

19:46.351 --> 19:46.810
with the green
shoulder thingies.

19:46.894 --> 19:48.770
Guards, stop them!

19:50.355 --> 19:53.358
- We'll handle the guards.
You guys get Jimbo.

19:53.442 --> 19:55.861
- [grunts of combat]

19:55.944 --> 19:58.196
- [dramatic music]

19:58.280 --> 19:59.615
- Give it up, Jimbo!

19:59.698 --> 20:01.450
- Never!

20:01.533 --> 20:02.993
Wah!

20:03.076 --> 20:04.328
- [laughing]

20:04.411 --> 20:05.954
What do you think
you're gonna do--

20:06.038 --> 20:06.622
flip us like pancakes?

20:06.705 --> 20:09.875
- Yes, actually.

20:09.958 --> 20:14.796
- [swords clanging]

20:14.880 --> 20:18.300
- [dramatic music]

20:18.383 --> 20:20.510
- KING:
No, don't hurt my cake!

20:20.594 --> 20:21.845
- You heard
the birthday boy.

20:21.929 --> 20:23.305
Back up!

20:23.388 --> 20:24.806
- GUARD:
[groans]

20:24.890 --> 20:27.809
- PRUDENCE:
[roaring]

20:27.893 --> 20:31.313
- My presents!

20:31.396 --> 20:32.856
- We've got the cake.
Now what?

20:32.940 --> 20:36.652
- [dramatic music]

20:36.735 --> 20:38.487
- Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

20:38.570 --> 20:40.280
- Yeah, but we only
have one chance.

20:40.364 --> 20:42.824
Hey, Jimbo, you misspelled
"birthday" on the cake.

20:42.908 --> 20:44.451
- Aw, nuggets.
For reals?

20:48.830 --> 20:50.916
- My ca-a-a-ke!

20:56.088 --> 20:57.464
- I've gotta go
check on my dad.

20:59.383 --> 21:01.593
- You ruined my revenge,
Phoenix Squad.

21:01.677 --> 21:03.845
I will return
and make you pay for--

21:06.807 --> 21:11.144
- Frozen loser says what?
[laughing]

21:11.228 --> 21:12.813
- What the dragon's butt
is going on?

21:12.896 --> 21:14.856
- [magic chiming]

21:16.441 --> 21:19.027
- Dad, Jimbo sabotaged
the cake.

21:19.111 --> 21:21.697
But the Phoenix Squad
saved us.

21:21.780 --> 21:25.033
- So, I like the green
shoulder thingie people?

21:25.117 --> 21:26.368
Oh, this is all
very confusing.

21:29.288 --> 21:32.958
- I lied when I said
I knew the recipe.

21:33.041 --> 21:34.376
I tried to fill
in for Eliza

21:34.459 --> 21:36.795
because I know how
much you miss her.

21:36.878 --> 21:38.547
I'm sorry.

21:38.630 --> 21:41.633
- You never have to
fill in for Eliza.

21:41.717 --> 21:43.385
I do miss her,

21:43.468 --> 21:46.138
but I have
you right here.

21:46.221 --> 21:49.683
That is the best
present of all.

21:49.766 --> 21:50.892
- Well...

21:50.976 --> 21:52.561
if you still want cake,

21:52.644 --> 21:54.229
we can have the one
I made for you.

21:54.312 --> 21:55.188
- Well, why didn't
you tell me about this?

21:55.272 --> 21:58.984
There is no such thing
as a bad cake.

22:01.153 --> 22:02.779
Oh! I was wrong!

22:03.864 --> 22:06.908
Uh, you know, I, uh...

22:06.992 --> 22:08.577
I think I'm
a pie guy now.
