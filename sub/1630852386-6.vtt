WEBVTT

00:22.272 --> 00:23.523
Le Chef Hot? Really?

00:24.691 --> 00:25.650
What's the problem?

00:25.734 --> 00:27.360
This is my restaurant opening,

00:27.444 --> 00:29.612
and this feels a little lazy,
to be honest.

00:29.696 --> 00:32.449
Or maybe you don't care
because you're only here temporarily.

00:32.532 --> 00:33.450
Ouch.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.661
Look, no one at Savoir
cares more about this restaurant opening,

00:36.745 --> 00:39.789
or you, more than I do. It's all I've been
doing for the past week.

00:39.873 --> 00:42.042
I don't know how
you've been helping the restaurant,

00:42.125 --> 00:44.419
but I've been propositioned
by half the women in Paris.

00:44.502 --> 00:45.962
Well, you're welcome.

00:47.172 --> 00:50.592
And we've also reached out
to tastemakers, influencers, bloggers

00:50.675 --> 00:53.178
and every food publication in France.

00:53.261 --> 00:56.014
And created a highly curated guest list
for tomorrow night.

00:57.348 --> 01:00.310
No more than 50 covers.
That's all the restaurant can handle.

01:00.393 --> 01:02.437
I know. I've got it under control.

01:11.071 --> 01:13.281
Meet our newest client.

01:14.783 --> 01:16.159
Ooh.

01:16.242 --> 01:18.119
Vespa. I love it.

01:18.203 --> 01:19.412
You know, when I was 15,

01:19.496 --> 01:22.207
my mom and I took one on a fudge tour
around Mackinac Island.

01:22.290 --> 01:23.124
It was awesome.

01:23.208 --> 01:25.293
That's nice!

01:25.960 --> 01:28.129
-What is fudge?

01:28.213 --> 01:31.216
Well, this Vespa
is an exclusive limited release design

01:31.299 --> 01:34.511
by the creative directors
of Dior's women's collections.

01:34.594 --> 01:35.470
Beautiful.

01:35.553 --> 01:39.557
They want to market it
as the next must-have accessory for women.

01:39.641 --> 01:41.976
Yes, and they've given us quite a budget,

01:42.060 --> 01:44.896
so we should market it
like we'd market any high-fashion bag.

01:44.979 --> 01:47.357
It's like a purse you can ride.

01:48.316 --> 01:53.238
I'll make a list of all the photographers
who have shot women straddling things.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.074
I'm surprised you don't have that already.

02:00.995 --> 02:02.705
I'm going to see Pierre.

02:02.789 --> 02:05.500
French <i>Vogue</i> is doing a piece on him
and he wants moral support.

02:05.583 --> 02:08.586
You know that's publicity, right?
Not marketing. You don't have to do that.

02:08.670 --> 02:09.796
Don't be jealous.

02:09.879 --> 02:12.006
You're lucky
he won't have anything to do with you.

02:12.090 --> 02:13.758
He's so high-maintenance.

02:15.301 --> 02:16.344
What are those?

02:16.427 --> 02:18.721
Oh, just photos from the Chopard party.

02:18.805 --> 02:21.558
Please, delete anything
with me and Benoît.

02:22.267 --> 02:24.394
I don't want to be reminded
of the humiliation.

02:36.781 --> 02:39.826
Yes, okay. Okay. Bye.

02:39.909 --> 02:42.162
Have you seen
our Chopard pictures?

02:43.872 --> 02:47.458
I think our <i>bateau-mouche</i> photographer
had a little crush on you.

02:47.542 --> 02:49.586
I saw you two getting familiar.

02:49.669 --> 02:51.588
Thought there might have been
a <i>bateau</i> smooch.

02:51.671 --> 02:53.464
He's way too young.

02:53.548 --> 02:55.800
And young people tend to annoy me.

02:59.554 --> 03:00.388
Anything else?

03:00.471 --> 03:01.890
No. That's it.

03:05.351 --> 03:06.186


03:14.360 --> 03:17.614
Erik? Yes, it's Sylvie Grateau
from Savoir.

03:17.697 --> 03:19.908
Sylvie. How are you?

03:20.491 --> 03:24.120
I'm fine. I was just looking at the photos
from the Chopard event.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.873
<i>I hope you're not disappointed.</i>
-Oh, no, no.

03:26.956 --> 03:31.044
But I seem to have gotten in the way
of your camera on quite a few occasions.

03:32.420 --> 03:33.838
Those are my favorite ones.

03:34.422 --> 03:39.135
We'll see what the client has to say.
We're speaking with them later today.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.720
<i>You'll have to let me know.</i>

03:40.803 --> 03:43.223
Maybe over a drink? Tonight?

03:44.766 --> 03:48.228
Of course.
Yeah, we'll discuss the feedback.

03:48.770 --> 03:50.939
I hope you don't mind
coming to St. Germain?

03:51.606 --> 03:52.815
It'd be my pleasure.

03:52.899 --> 03:53.900
Okay.

04:09.040 --> 04:11.042
This space is so big.

04:11.125 --> 04:13.920
A big space for a big personality.

04:14.045 --> 04:18.049
Oh, I really hope you're talking about
my personality, and not my ass!

04:19.759 --> 04:20.969
Oh, Ellen!

04:22.428 --> 04:24.555
Oh, my God, are you joking?

04:24.639 --> 04:27.058
Ellen von Unwerth is
shooting this campaign?

04:27.141 --> 04:30.144
Please, I practically made her career. Oh!

04:30.228 --> 04:31.437
Hello!

04:33.523 --> 04:35.108
-It's so good to see you.
-Yes!

04:35.191 --> 04:37.277
Sorry it's taken such a long time.

04:37.360 --> 04:41.114
No apologies necessary, Mrs. von Unwerth.
You are so amazing.

04:41.197 --> 04:43.950
-I absolutely love your work.
-Oh, thank you.

04:44.033 --> 04:47.328
Your book <i>Fräulein</i> made me
appreciate breasts for the first time.

04:47.412 --> 04:50.248
Oh, that's sweet.

04:50.331 --> 04:52.166
-Is there a problem?
-Uh, not at all.

04:52.750 --> 04:55.628
-He's a fan.
-Ah. I see.

04:55.712 --> 04:58.715
I'm Gerhard. Ellen's agent. A word?

05:00.591 --> 05:01.592
Um…

05:03.011 --> 05:05.305
Fawning makes us all uncomfortable.

05:06.097 --> 05:07.348
You're Pierre's assistant?

05:07.432 --> 05:09.559
No, I work for his marketing firm, Savoir?

05:09.642 --> 05:11.936
-Mmm.
-I just wanted to come and take a look.

05:12.020 --> 05:14.439
And? Looks good?

05:15.189 --> 05:16.190
Really.

05:16.274 --> 05:17.692
<i>Gut.</i>

05:17.775 --> 05:19.694
<i>-Bon.</i>
<i>-Toll.</i>

05:26.200 --> 05:27.160
Aha.

05:32.457 --> 05:36.794
A little more crazy?
Play the part. Yes! That's fantastic!

05:40.923 --> 05:42.467
-Gerhard.
-<i>Ja?</i>

05:43.051 --> 05:46.637
Savoir is looking for someone
to shoot a Vespa campaign for us.

05:46.721 --> 05:48.431
Oh, the scooter?

05:48.514 --> 05:49.557
<i>-Oui.</i>
-Ah.

05:49.640 --> 05:52.310
In collaboration with Dior.
It's very chic.

05:52.393 --> 05:55.563
As long as Ellen is in Paris,
do you think she might be interested?

05:55.646 --> 05:56.481
Uh…

05:57.273 --> 06:02.028
Ellen's extremely busy,
but, uh, send me the information.

06:02.111 --> 06:04.864
I will. And just so you know,
there's quite a budget.

06:05.531 --> 06:08.785
With Ellen it's always about the creative.

06:08.868 --> 06:10.161
Not the budget.

06:17.210 --> 06:20.296
Hi. My partner is Alfie.

06:20.797 --> 06:23.132
Alfie was born in Hampshire.

06:23.216 --> 06:26.928
He has three brothers
and a dog named Clover.

06:27.595 --> 06:31.182
Alfie works at a bank
and he loves football.

06:31.724 --> 06:34.602
Alfie is short for Alfred.

06:34.685 --> 06:35.812
Thank you!

06:40.817 --> 06:43.319
Emily has a job in marketing.

06:43.820 --> 06:46.072
Emily wears silly clothes.

06:47.448 --> 06:49.075
Emily likes to work.

06:50.076 --> 06:52.120
Emily doesn't like to have fun.

06:57.917 --> 06:58.793
Bravo.

06:59.794 --> 07:01.087
Excuse me.

07:01.170 --> 07:02.797
<i>That</i> was your presentation?

07:02.880 --> 07:06.092
After everything that I told you.
That my clothes are <i>"amusants"?</i>

07:06.175 --> 07:08.136
You know that that means funny-looking.

07:08.219 --> 07:10.930
And more importantly,
I do like to have fun. Okay?

07:11.013 --> 07:12.598
I am a fun person.

07:12.682 --> 07:15.560
Which, had you gotten to
know me at all, you would know.

07:16.144 --> 07:17.437
Well, I apologize.

07:19.730 --> 07:20.690
Do you want a ride?

07:21.607 --> 07:23.901
What? No, you can't
fit two people on that thing.

07:23.985 --> 07:26.988
Just like I said. No fun.

07:35.538 --> 07:38.332
So, they were
happy with the pictures?

07:39.167 --> 07:40.168
They were.

07:41.335 --> 07:42.545
You're very talented.

07:43.171 --> 07:45.590
Did they say that, or are you saying that?

07:45.673 --> 07:47.049
Well, actually, <i>I</i> am.

07:49.218 --> 07:51.888
I used to be a photographer.
In a past life.

07:52.638 --> 07:53.806
-Really?
-Mmm-hmm.

07:54.640 --> 07:57.351
I used to take candid shots
of people in St Tropez.

07:57.435 --> 08:00.146
-But that was a very long time ago.

08:00.229 --> 08:02.523
Well, I'd love to see your work sometime.

08:02.607 --> 08:04.692
Oh, you're a fan of vintage photography?

08:05.234 --> 08:06.486
Actually, I am.

08:19.248 --> 08:20.333
<i>Bonjour!</i>

08:26.422 --> 08:30.593
There is only one reason
Sylvie breaks the "no food at work" rule.

08:30.676 --> 08:32.929
It's if she's had sex the night before.

08:33.554 --> 08:36.891
I think it might be Erik,
the <i>bateau-mouche</i> photographer.

08:36.974 --> 08:39.185
Half the photos he took
at the event were of her.

08:39.268 --> 08:41.103
Really? The photographer?

08:43.940 --> 08:47.151
Antoine has added some guests
for the restaurant's opening tonight.

08:47.235 --> 08:49.862
-I'll forward it to you.
-Great. Thanks.

08:55.535 --> 08:59.539
Emily, we really shouldn't be
discussing Sylvie's private life.

09:05.294 --> 09:06.170
Okay.

09:13.177 --> 09:14.262
Ooh.

09:14.345 --> 09:15.179
Um…

09:17.056 --> 09:20.935
We're supposed to have
50 reservations tonight. This is like 150.

09:21.018 --> 09:23.062
We can't possibly seat
this many people for dinner.

09:23.145 --> 09:25.147
Well, not everyone will be coming to eat.

09:25.231 --> 09:27.692
Some come to drink,
and some probably won't come at all.

09:27.775 --> 09:30.736
Okay. I guess we can just
deal with it when we get there.

09:30.820 --> 09:33.447
No, my work for the restaurant is done.

09:33.531 --> 09:36.993
You can hand-hold your chef
on opening night. I have plans.

09:38.035 --> 09:43.583
Well, I really hope you enjoy your plans.
You deserve plans, Sylvie.

09:45.876 --> 09:48.296
So don't worry about tonight.
It's under control.

09:58.306 --> 09:59.265
Hey there.

10:00.182 --> 10:01.809
-Camille.
-The place looks great.

10:02.310 --> 10:04.145
Yeah, not bad.

10:04.687 --> 10:07.064
My family couldn't make it,
so they sent a gift.

10:07.148 --> 10:08.608
Oh, they didn't have to do that.

10:10.067 --> 10:11.319
-That's so nice.

10:11.402 --> 10:13.279
It's also a peace offering from me.

10:15.531 --> 10:17.158
This is nice. Super.

10:18.326 --> 10:21.370
I'm really happy for you.
This has been your dream for so long,

10:21.871 --> 10:23.372
and I knew it would happen.

10:23.998 --> 10:26.292
Thank you, Camille. This means a lot.

10:26.375 --> 10:27.585
My pleasure.

10:28.919 --> 10:32.173
I care about you. It doesn't matter
whether or not we're together.

10:33.299 --> 10:34.467
I feel the same way.

10:35.134 --> 10:36.844
So I hope this means
you're coming tonight?

10:36.927 --> 10:38.512
Yes. I wouldn't miss it.

10:38.596 --> 10:40.139
<i>-Oui? </i>
-Mmm.

10:41.891 --> 10:42.767
See you tonight.

10:43.351 --> 10:44.352
See you tonight.

11:05.748 --> 11:08.376
-That's an attractive crowd.
-It sure is.

11:08.459 --> 11:11.087
And so far, all the guests
who've booked have arrived.

11:11.671 --> 11:14.298
Okay, so the blog <i>Paris By Mouth</i> is here.

11:14.382 --> 11:16.759
They're seated next to <i>24 Hours in Paris.</i>

11:16.842 --> 11:19.929
And then over there
are Sybile and Mathilde Ichou.

11:20.012 --> 11:21.514
The sisters and models

11:21.597 --> 11:24.350
-who have a combined following of 140,000.
-Huh.

11:24.433 --> 11:27.395
In the corner is Mr. Kim
from <i>Mr. Kim Shoots Food.</i>

11:27.478 --> 11:29.397
His Instagram is art,

11:29.480 --> 11:33.401
and he was shortlisted
in the Pink Lady Food Photo Awards 2020.

11:33.943 --> 11:35.986
-How do you keep all this in your head?

11:36.070 --> 11:37.405
It's my job.

11:37.488 --> 11:39.573
And at your two o'clock is Madame Mange.

11:39.657 --> 11:42.034
She's been food blogging
since food blogging started.

11:42.118 --> 11:45.454
She is old-school.
Not really sure who she's dining with,

11:45.538 --> 11:47.748
-but they look <i>très</i> serious.
-Hmm.

11:48.332 --> 11:50.334
-I'll go say hello.
-Good idea.

11:52.795 --> 11:55.172
-Alfie?
-<i>Emily, what's going on?</i>

11:55.256 --> 11:58.008
Listen, I feel really bad
about what happened the other day.

11:58.801 --> 12:02.388
You were telling me about what I got wrong
about you and I cut you off.

12:02.888 --> 12:05.850
So I was thinking,
maybe you come down to the pub,

12:05.933 --> 12:07.685
<i>and I'd buy you a beer.</i>

12:07.768 --> 12:10.479
I'm actually at a work event
and I think it's going to run late.

12:10.563 --> 12:13.399
See? I knew it. No fun.

12:13.482 --> 12:14.942
My work <i>is</i> fun!

12:20.656 --> 12:22.199
I spoke to Madame Mange.

12:22.283 --> 12:25.369
Her guest is Caroline Duclos,
the reviewer from <i>Le Figaro.</i>

12:25.453 --> 12:27.621
What? Oh, my God, no way.

12:27.705 --> 12:29.874
Wait, I thought they were
supposed to be anonymous?

12:29.957 --> 12:31.751
Some people find me charming, Emily.

12:31.834 --> 12:33.210
-Hey, lady.

12:34.462 --> 12:36.380
Wow, this place looks great.

12:36.464 --> 12:38.257
Antoine, this is my friend, Mindy.

12:38.340 --> 12:39.383
Oh. <i>Enchantée.</i>

12:39.467 --> 12:40.718
How have you been keeping

12:40.801 --> 12:42.511
-this beautiful woman from me?
-Oh.

12:42.595 --> 12:43.888
Delightful to meet you, Mindy.

12:43.971 --> 12:46.348
Okay, you're a charmer.

12:46.932 --> 12:47.975
What was I saying?

12:49.769 --> 12:53.355
Wait, that's Antoine? <i>The</i> Antoine?

12:53.439 --> 12:54.398
Yep.

12:54.482 --> 12:57.735
-Well…
-Okay, I'm going to go check on Gabriel.

12:57.818 --> 12:59.445
-I'll meet you at the table.
-Okay.

13:01.614 --> 13:05.201
Ooh! That looks beautiful!
How are you feeling?

13:05.284 --> 13:07.119
-All good.
-You look good.

13:07.828 --> 13:11.624
I mean, you look like you're
in a good zone with the food.

13:11.707 --> 13:12.917
What are you doing here?

13:13.000 --> 13:15.503
The reviewer from <i>Le Figaro</i>
has joined us this evening.

13:15.586 --> 13:18.798
She snuck in with Madame Mange,
so you'd better sauce her duck good.

13:18.881 --> 13:19.924
You know what I mean.

13:20.424 --> 13:21.842
-What table?
-Let me show you.

13:23.427 --> 13:24.386
There she is.

13:27.973 --> 13:29.892
It looks like
she's enjoying her appetizer.

13:29.975 --> 13:31.393
Not appetizer. Entrée.

13:31.477 --> 13:33.395
-But it's her first course.
-Exactly.

13:33.479 --> 13:34.980
-I'm so confused.

13:35.064 --> 13:37.024
-What a success already.
-Camille.

13:37.107 --> 13:38.526
-Thank you.
-Hi.

13:40.236 --> 13:42.738
Camille brought over cases
of her family's champagne.

13:42.822 --> 13:43.864
Oh, that's so nice.

13:43.948 --> 13:46.200
You're doing a great job
with this opening.

13:46.283 --> 13:47.660
-It's crowded.

13:47.743 --> 13:49.036
There were only 50 reservations.

13:49.119 --> 13:50.246
Doesn't feel like that.

13:50.329 --> 13:52.498
Antoine added more people
than we were expecting.

13:52.581 --> 13:53.666
Without consulting me?

13:53.749 --> 13:56.502
Restaurant openings are crowded,
especially when a place is hot.

13:56.585 --> 13:59.129
Well, we won't be hot for long
if people can't get a table.

13:59.213 --> 14:00.047
Um…

14:00.756 --> 14:02.842
Why don't I give out
complimentary champagne

14:02.925 --> 14:04.134
to the people who are waiting?

14:04.218 --> 14:06.095
Oh, my God, that's brilliant.

14:06.178 --> 14:08.097
-Thank you, Camille.
-You're welcome.

14:15.271 --> 14:17.815
-Who are you?
-Camille. Let me give you a hand.

14:17.898 --> 14:19.441
Natalie, I'll take it.

14:22.945 --> 14:24.029
Who wants champagne?

14:27.366 --> 14:29.285
-Finally!
-Sorry, it's been crazy.

14:29.368 --> 14:31.078
Now you've got to catch up.

14:31.161 --> 14:34.540
-So, guess who's super not gay?
-Mmm.

14:34.623 --> 14:37.751
Benoît. He's not into men, he's into me.

14:39.336 --> 14:40.296
Twist.

14:40.379 --> 14:43.883
But I'm not going to do anything
that's gonna ruin the band dynamics.

14:43.966 --> 14:45.175
Yeah, no, take it from me,

14:45.259 --> 14:48.804
if there's any concern that it will
disrupt the workplace, don't do it.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.973
Mmm, now I'm not so sure

14:51.056 --> 14:53.559
because my workplace
could use some disrupting.

14:53.642 --> 14:55.644
I haven't been done in a while, you know.

14:56.562 --> 14:57.646
Ooh!

14:57.730 --> 14:59.189
These drinks are strong!

14:59.273 --> 15:00.399
How is everyone?

15:00.482 --> 15:01.483
So good!

15:01.984 --> 15:04.570
But, um, the food should
probably come here soon,

15:04.653 --> 15:06.822
because the drinks came and went.

15:07.865 --> 15:08.991
Am I screaming?

15:09.074 --> 15:11.243
Uh, yeah,
did it get a little loud in here?

15:11.327 --> 15:13.746
No. It's getting fun, not loud.

15:13.829 --> 15:15.748
Look around,
people are enjoying themselves.

15:18.334 --> 15:20.169
-Oh.

15:21.545 --> 15:24.924
-Uh, maybe a little too much. Excuse me.
-Okay.

15:30.137 --> 15:30.971
Hi.

15:31.055 --> 15:33.974
I can barely hear the orders.
You had everything under control.

15:34.058 --> 15:35.809
I don't have control over the volume.

15:35.893 --> 15:36.977
But you're doing great.

15:37.061 --> 15:39.271
Looks like Caroline from <i>Le Figaro</i>
is finished.

15:39.355 --> 15:41.148
Now might be a good time to say "hi."

15:46.445 --> 15:47.738
This is ridiculous.

15:47.821 --> 15:50.282
Opening night.
Maybe just treat it more like a party.

15:51.158 --> 15:54.912
You may have talent,
but no dish is worth this chaos.

15:55.829 --> 15:56.956
My apologies.

15:59.458 --> 16:02.211
This isn't a restaurant.
This is a fucking nightclub,

16:02.294 --> 16:04.630
which is exactly
what Antoine wanted all along.

16:04.713 --> 16:06.090
Do you know what? I'm done.

16:06.173 --> 16:08.133
Wait!

16:09.051 --> 16:10.761
Did my chef just walk out the door?

16:10.844 --> 16:12.930
-He's pretty upset.
-Upset?

16:14.181 --> 16:17.726
Well, you can tell him to keep walking.
Chefs are a dime a dozen in Paris.

16:20.062 --> 16:21.063
What's going on?

16:21.730 --> 16:23.107
Well, Gabriel just quit,

16:23.190 --> 16:25.526
and I think Antoine just fired him
at the same time.

16:25.609 --> 16:26.735
This is a mess.

16:26.860 --> 16:28.988
Um… I've been there before, okay?

16:29.071 --> 16:31.699
It's a combination of
ego and fear, it will pass.

16:31.782 --> 16:34.076
You talk to Antoine,
I'll talk to Gabriel. Right?

16:34.159 --> 16:35.077
Thank you.

16:36.245 --> 16:37.329
Gabriel!

16:38.205 --> 16:41.041
I can't believe Antoine!
He doesn't know what he's doing!

16:41.125 --> 16:43.335
He's arrogant!
He's never run a restaurant before!

16:43.419 --> 16:44.962
Okay. You're right.

16:45.045 --> 16:48.507
Of course you know more about
running a restaurant, but you need him.

16:48.590 --> 16:49.842
Don't ruin this opportunity.

16:49.925 --> 16:52.052
I know this is what you've always wanted.

16:52.136 --> 16:54.471
Unless it has changed.
But I don't think it has.

16:55.305 --> 16:56.724
Hey, listen.

16:57.975 --> 17:01.395
The biggest mistake would be throwing away
something that means so much to you

17:01.478 --> 17:03.522
because things are hard right now.

17:09.236 --> 17:12.406
Look, Antoine,
I just don't want you to make a mistake.

17:12.489 --> 17:15.409
You could've bought any building
and hired any cook

17:15.492 --> 17:16.910
and pumped music in.

17:16.994 --> 17:19.621
But you bought this place
because of Gabriel.

17:19.705 --> 17:22.249
Maybe he's too young
and this isn't something he can handle.

17:22.332 --> 17:24.418
Or maybe he wants
a quiet little restaurant.

17:24.501 --> 17:25.461
This is what I want.

17:26.462 --> 17:28.213
Your friend seems to like it.

17:31.675 --> 17:35.054
We have a sexy, fun crowd.
This is the Lavaux brand.

17:35.637 --> 17:36.930
Okay, here's an idea.

17:37.014 --> 17:41.518
Um, we keep it a restaurant until 11:00,
and then it's a club.

17:41.602 --> 17:43.312
It's the best of both worlds.

17:44.563 --> 17:45.647
That sounds reasonable.

17:46.231 --> 17:49.318
If Gabriel decides to come back,
we'll have something to discuss.

17:49.401 --> 17:50.277
Okay.

17:52.613 --> 17:53.447
Okay.

17:54.782 --> 17:55.824
Get down!

17:55.908 --> 17:57.826
-Oh.

17:58.410 --> 17:59.495
Sorry, sorry.

18:06.960 --> 18:10.589
I was, uh, taking a break outside.
The kitchen is too hot.

18:11.131 --> 18:12.216
I understand.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.384
What a successful night, right?

18:14.885 --> 18:17.054
Yeah. So many more people
than we were expecting.

18:17.137 --> 18:21.100
Yes, but the music is too loud.
I was just telling the DJ to turn it down.

18:21.183 --> 18:25.229
And from now on, it won't get turned up
until the dinner service ends at 11:00.

18:25.813 --> 18:28.107
I like that idea. Yeah.

18:28.190 --> 18:29.024
Great.

18:34.029 --> 18:35.697
Thank you so much for being here.

18:35.781 --> 18:36.907
-Of course.
-Of course.

18:52.047 --> 18:54.299
Thank you. I like your apartment.

18:55.259 --> 18:56.927
I like you in my apartment.

19:00.764 --> 19:02.933
Is that you, back when you were modeling?

19:03.433 --> 19:04.977
No, that's not me.

19:05.561 --> 19:06.603
I took that.

19:07.729 --> 19:11.733
A friend of mine opened
a motorcycle café in Amsterdam and, uh…

19:11.817 --> 19:15.112
Yeah, he asked me
to take some pictures of him to display.

19:15.946 --> 19:18.365
You Dutch like your coffee
and your bikes, huh?

19:20.159 --> 19:24.163
It was also the first time
I got paid taking photos, so I display it.

19:26.790 --> 19:29.376
You know what?
We have a fashion shoot next week

19:29.459 --> 19:31.670
and we're still looking for someone.

19:31.753 --> 19:33.338
-Oh, yeah?
-Yep.

19:34.047 --> 19:37.301
It's Vespa in collaboration with Dior.
It's a very big budget.

19:38.802 --> 19:41.263
-You think you can handle that?
-I think I could.

19:43.640 --> 19:44.850
Then it's yours.

19:46.268 --> 19:47.519
-Really?
-Mmm-hmm.

19:48.103 --> 19:50.689
That's amazing, Sylvie.

19:50.772 --> 19:52.691
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

20:03.535 --> 20:05.954
Pictures of opening night
came out in <i>Voici!</i>

20:06.038 --> 20:07.372
I guess it went well.

20:07.456 --> 20:09.583
Oh, I know. No complaints.
How was your night?

20:16.673 --> 20:20.385
Pain au chocolat and apple turnover.

20:20.469 --> 20:21.678
Ah.

20:21.762 --> 20:24.097
She must be very satisfied.

20:31.813 --> 20:33.857
Hello, Julien? It's Gerhard.

20:33.941 --> 20:35.984
<i>-Guten Tag.</i>
<i>Bonjour.</i>

20:36.818 --> 20:40.113
It wasn't easy, but I convinced Ellen
to do the shoot. <i>Merci.</i>

20:40.197 --> 20:42.532
-Ah, that's wonderful. I'm so happy.
-<i>I know.</i>

20:42.616 --> 20:44.826
I already called Vespa
to check about the budget.

20:44.910 --> 20:47.329
Well, not that Ellen cares,
but it's suitable.

20:47.412 --> 20:49.706
-So the client's on board?
-<i>Of course!</i>

20:49.790 --> 20:51.166
Why wouldn't they be?

20:51.250 --> 20:53.085
-Oh, yeah, Julien?
-<i>Yes.</i>

20:53.710 --> 20:55.545
You must come to Hamburg sometime.

20:56.171 --> 20:57.464
It's an absolute treasure.

21:05.889 --> 21:08.016
I've got some very big news.

21:08.600 --> 21:11.853
I ran into Ellen von Unwerth
at Pierre's magazine shoot

21:11.937 --> 21:15.274
and talked her into
doing the Vespa campaign!

21:15.357 --> 21:17.734
Really? That's huge!

21:17.818 --> 21:21.780
Ellen was on my list.
She shot Adriana Lima straddling a broom.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.907
Sorry, I forgot to tell you,

21:23.991 --> 21:25.909
we already have
a photographer for the shoot.

21:25.993 --> 21:27.995
-Who?
-Erik DeGroot.

21:28.078 --> 21:30.580
You mean the party photographer
from the <i>bateau-mouche?</i>

21:30.664 --> 21:32.499
-Yes.
-But I have Ellen--

21:32.582 --> 21:34.167
I believe I made myself clear.

21:37.296 --> 21:41.842
Why on earth Sylvie would choose
that amateur over Ellen von Unwerth?

21:41.925 --> 21:43.468
He's one step up from a paparazzi.

21:44.052 --> 21:45.387
The <i>viennoiserie.</i>

21:46.805 --> 21:48.682
Did you see what she brought this morning?

21:49.474 --> 21:50.767
Is she sleeping with him?

21:51.768 --> 21:53.478
Ah, unbelievable!

21:53.562 --> 21:57.441
Ellen's agent thinks it's a done deal.
He's already called Vespa.

21:58.108 --> 22:00.694
-Where are you going?
-To throw myself in the Seine.

22:04.573 --> 22:05.907
Yes, what is it?

22:05.991 --> 22:08.410
I wanted to follow up
on that photographer discussion.

22:08.493 --> 22:09.661
What discussion?

22:09.745 --> 22:11.747
Given that
we might have Ellen von Unwerth,

22:11.830 --> 22:13.832
I would hope your judgment
isn't being clouded

22:13.915 --> 22:16.043
by the obvious interest that

22:16.126 --> 22:20.547
another less world-famous photographer
is taking in you.

22:20.630 --> 22:23.258
Careful, Emily.
I don't like what you're implying.

22:23.842 --> 22:24.885
-Sylvie?
-Yes?

22:24.968 --> 22:27.596
I have Vespa on the phone. Line one.

22:27.763 --> 22:29.348
Hmm.

22:30.807 --> 22:32.434
Hello. How are you?

22:32.517 --> 22:34.770
<i>We are so excited</i>
<i>about the campaign.</i>

22:34.853 --> 22:36.063
Yes, so are we.

22:36.146 --> 22:39.483
And you should know,
we've had a lot of discussions internally,

22:39.566 --> 22:42.027
and we found
the perfect photographer for the shoot.

22:42.110 --> 22:44.029
<i>We heard.</i>
<i>Ellen von Unwerth.</i>

22:44.112 --> 22:46.740
<i>We couldn't think of a better person</i>
<i>to shoot the scooter.</i>

22:46.823 --> 22:49.659
<i>She's sexy and feminine,</i>
<i>just like the bike.</i>

22:49.743 --> 22:52.037
Yes. Can you give me a minute?

22:55.332 --> 22:58.293
How do they know about Ellen?

22:59.628 --> 23:01.338
Are we meeting in here?

23:01.421 --> 23:02.798
All of you, out!

23:14.935 --> 23:16.228
Yes, it's me again.

23:16.311 --> 23:21.358
Um… Yes, I'm glad you're happy
'cause we're thrilled about Ellen too.

23:21.441 --> 23:23.693
<i>Great, that's fantastic.</i>

23:25.487 --> 23:28.448
You'd better enjoy it now
because we are not getting any more.

23:37.040 --> 23:40.752
Hey! Sorry I'm so gay,
I couldn't decide what to wear.

23:41.711 --> 23:43.505
Did I say "gay"? I meant "late."

23:43.588 --> 23:45.298
-Sorry I'm so late. God.

23:45.382 --> 23:47.426
Don't worry about it.
You always look amazing.

23:47.509 --> 23:49.344
-Oh.
-And you usually are late.

23:52.222 --> 23:54.182
Sorry, I don't know why I'm so nervous.

23:54.266 --> 23:56.893
I think the nerves will go away
when you start singing.

23:56.977 --> 23:57.894
Yeah.

23:57.978 --> 24:00.021
Um, how about we try this one?

24:03.275 --> 24:04.192
Really?

24:04.734 --> 24:06.194
We've only rehearsed this once.

24:06.278 --> 24:07.529
Yeah, but we nailed it.

24:08.864 --> 24:10.740
-Okay.
-Cool.

25:32.948 --> 25:36.743
I know you wanted to talk about the shoot,
so I brought some storyboards.

25:37.410 --> 25:38.578
Yeah, about that, Erik,

25:38.662 --> 25:41.248
um, the client wants
to go in a different direction.

25:41.331 --> 25:43.166
-I'm very sorry.
-Oh.

25:43.750 --> 25:44.584
I see.

25:45.502 --> 25:47.420
But I do think
you're very talented

25:47.504 --> 25:50.257
and I'm very sorry
we won't be working together, really.

25:51.508 --> 25:52.717
I am too.

25:55.720 --> 25:59.849
But I hope that doesn't mean
we won't see each other again.

26:05.730 --> 26:07.691
Well, no, it doesn't have to mean that.

26:21.413 --> 26:23.623
The Vespa's here. Come look.

26:28.795 --> 26:29.963
Very sexy.

26:30.046 --> 26:31.381
Okay, take my picture.

26:32.591 --> 26:35.677
Gerhard is going to love it.

26:37.637 --> 26:39.139
-Hmm!

26:40.307 --> 26:41.641
Uh, may I?

26:50.734 --> 26:52.527
-What are you doing?

26:52.611 --> 26:54.446
I'm late for French class.

26:57.407 --> 27:00.619
Oh, be careful!
This is not Mackinac Island!

27:23.058 --> 27:24.267
