00:06.310 --> 00:08.008
- Wait, maybe I should
go in first.

00:08.051 --> 00:09.096
- It doesn't matter
who goes in first.

00:09.139 --> 00:10.271
We just can't go in together,

00:10.314 --> 00:11.489
'cause it's gonna
look suspicious.

00:11.533 --> 00:13.143
- Well then,
if it doesn't matter,

00:13.187 --> 00:14.362
I'll go in first.
- That's fine, go in first.

00:14.405 --> 00:16.146
I'm happy to sit here
for ten minutes

00:16.190 --> 00:17.626
and listen to the radio.
- Okay, no, you go in first.

00:17.669 --> 00:18.627
- Oh.
- Amy.

00:18.670 --> 00:20.324
Hey. Listen.

00:20.368 --> 00:22.022
Sorry for accidentally
texting you that nude.

00:22.065 --> 00:23.849
- No worries.

00:23.893 --> 00:25.025
- What's Jonah doing in there?

00:25.068 --> 00:27.462
- Oh, hey, Dina.
Uh, I was just

00:27.505 --> 00:29.725
looking for this
Del Taco receipt

00:29.768 --> 00:32.075
for 12 tacos.

00:32.119 --> 00:33.946
- You must have been
very hungry. No judgment.

00:33.990 --> 00:36.166
- So did you two
drive together?

00:36.210 --> 00:38.299
- Um, yes? We did.

00:38.342 --> 00:40.605
We are carpooling
to save some money.

00:40.649 --> 00:41.737
- And the environment.

00:41.780 --> 00:43.043
- Well, saving money
is reason enough.

00:43.086 --> 00:44.174
No need to keep explaining.

00:44.218 --> 00:45.567
- What's going on?

00:45.610 --> 00:47.351
- Nothing!
- Maybe we should get inside?

00:47.395 --> 00:49.223
- Amy and Jonah are carpooling.

00:49.266 --> 00:51.355
- Oh! I'm in.
Carpool karaoke.

00:51.399 --> 00:52.922
- What's carpool karaoke?

00:52.965 --> 00:56.404
- You know how people like
to sing in the car? That.

00:56.447 --> 00:58.362
- Well, that settles that.
Dina, you're blocking my door.

00:58.406 --> 01:01.713
- Hey, Sayeed!
Amy and Jonah are carpooling!

01:01.757 --> 01:03.889
- Whoo! Carpool Karaoke!

01:03.933 --> 01:06.109
- That's what I said!

01:14.813 --> 01:17.468

Why are you guys carpooling

01:17.512 --> 01:19.340
when you live so far apart?

01:19.383 --> 01:21.124
You literally have to drive
past the store

01:21.168 --> 01:22.734
to pick each other up.

01:22.778 --> 01:25.302
- I'm surprised this hasn't
occurred to either one of you

01:25.346 --> 01:28.392
during your long morning drives
to each other's houses.

01:28.436 --> 01:31.395
- You know what, Cheyenne?
You are really good

01:31.439 --> 01:33.136
at this logistics stuff.
You should be planning

01:33.180 --> 01:34.398
everybody's carpools.

01:34.442 --> 01:35.791
- Really? You think so?

01:35.834 --> 01:37.445
- Yeah, you're really great
at it.

01:37.488 --> 01:39.229
- You have a gift
for logistics.

01:39.273 --> 01:42.493
- Oh, because I could. I mean,
I could do it right now.

01:42.537 --> 01:46.845
- Now would be great.
- Okay. I'm gonna.

01:46.889 --> 01:48.238
- Get it, girl!

01:50.458 --> 01:52.373
- Why don't you just tell
everybody you're dating?

This is the most boring secret
I've ever had to live with.

in our business, okay?

01:56.159 --> 01:57.769
This place loves gossip.

01:57.813 --> 01:59.119
- Well, at least get better
about hiding it.

01:59.162 --> 02:00.424
- What are you talking about?

02:00.468 --> 02:01.860
We're not acting different
around each other.

02:01.904 --> 02:03.166
- I mean, it's obvious to me,

02:03.210 --> 02:05.342
but I'm more perceptive
than most.

02:05.386 --> 02:07.649
Most people didn't even notice
that Henry and Jay

02:07.692 --> 02:09.216

02:09.259 --> 02:12.175
I mean, it seems obvious to me.

02:12.219 --> 02:14.264
- There's an opening
at the Fenton's store,

02:14.308 --> 02:16.223
and they said
that I could transfer.

02:16.266 --> 02:19.139
You just need to sign
this form.

02:21.532 --> 02:23.621
- Wait, is this about Jonah?

02:23.665 --> 02:25.884
Because I can make him
take you back, okay?

02:25.928 --> 02:28.452
Yeah, I'm his boss.
He's gotta do what I say.

02:28.496 --> 02:32.108
- That's so generous of you
to offer

02:32.152 --> 02:34.328
to force someone to be with me.

02:34.371 --> 02:36.895
Makes me feel really good
about myself.

02:36.939 --> 02:38.375
- It should.

02:38.419 --> 02:40.160
- Uh, but no,
this isn't about Jonah.

02:40.203 --> 02:43.728
I mean, the Fenton location is
just a lot closer to my house.

02:43.772 --> 02:48.037
- Well, if everyone only worked
at places that were close

02:48.080 --> 02:52.998
to their house, then I'd only
work at my neighbor's.

02:53.042 --> 02:54.870
- Yeah, that's a good point.

02:54.913 --> 02:57.525
- Should we get a scented
candle for our nightstand?

02:57.568 --> 02:58.569
- Yeah.

02:58.613 --> 03:00.092
- This one smells like
peanut butter.

What are you doing here?

03:12.583 --> 03:15.238
- Jerry and I
are moving in together.

03:15.282 --> 03:18.937
- Oh. Wow.
Congratulations, Sandra.

03:18.981 --> 03:21.549
Enjoy my HPV.

03:23.246 --> 03:24.682

03:24.726 --> 03:28.251
- Hey, Mateo,
how many times in a row

03:28.295 --> 03:30.514
have you been
employee of the month again?

03:30.558 --> 03:32.647
- Oh, I don't even keep track.

03:32.690 --> 03:35.519
- I think it's at least three--
- Five, it's five. Five.

03:35.563 --> 03:37.739
- Wow. That's a good run.

03:37.782 --> 03:42.396
Um, Kelly wants to transfer
to a different store,

03:42.439 --> 03:45.094
and I was thinking
maybe it's because

03:45.137 --> 03:47.270
she doesn't feel
appreciated here.

03:47.314 --> 03:49.533
So, then I was thinking,

03:49.577 --> 03:53.581
"What if we made her Employee
of the Month this month?"

03:53.624 --> 03:55.713
- Like, both of us
at the same time?

03:55.757 --> 03:58.847
- Well, maybe just her,
you know, as a token,

03:58.890 --> 04:01.110
to make her feel special.

04:01.153 --> 04:03.808
- Ah. What a cool idea.

04:03.852 --> 04:05.419
- Thank you.

04:05.462 --> 04:06.768
- So we would take it
away from me--

04:06.811 --> 04:08.726
- Yup.
- And give it to her.

04:08.770 --> 04:10.075
- Yes!

04:10.119 --> 04:11.686
- Love that, so much.

04:11.729 --> 04:12.948
- Great.

04:12.991 --> 04:14.863
- Although I do wonder--
devil's advocate...

04:14.906 --> 04:15.907
- Mm-hmm?

04:15.951 --> 04:17.735
- If it somehow cheapens
the award

04:17.779 --> 04:20.912
by just handing it out
to anyone, if that makes sense.

04:20.956 --> 04:24.742
- Well, she's not just anyone.
I mean, Kelly is wonderful.

04:24.786 --> 04:27.354
- Oh! Absolutely.
Without a doubt.

04:27.397 --> 04:29.007
Kelly's a delight.

04:29.051 --> 04:32.054
But at the same time,
she's also, you know,

04:32.097 --> 04:35.710
terrible... at the job.

04:35.753 --> 04:37.494
- Yeah.

04:37.538 --> 04:39.801
- I got a map and marked down
where everyone lived,

04:39.844 --> 04:42.107
and then I used logistics
to figure out

04:42.151 --> 04:43.935
the most efficient carpools.

04:43.979 --> 04:46.503
- Wow. You really put
a lot of effort into this.

04:46.547 --> 04:48.940
- Yeah, I haven't sold,
like, anything today.

04:48.984 --> 04:50.464
Like, nothing.

04:50.507 --> 04:53.031
- A few thoughts: you've got
Mark riding with Terrence.

04:53.075 --> 04:54.337
They hate each other.

04:54.381 --> 04:55.991
Sarah and Rob are going
through a divorce.

04:56.034 --> 04:59.690
Sarah had that secret family.
So did Rob.

04:59.734 --> 05:01.736
Um, see this line
between Heather and Cody?

05:01.779 --> 05:04.042
That's a river.
So how are they carpooling?

05:04.086 --> 05:05.609
Submarine? Yeah.

05:05.653 --> 05:08.133
Herman's riding with Rico,
but Rico's got BO,

05:08.177 --> 05:09.352
and Herman's dead.

05:09.396 --> 05:11.311
You can't put Phil
with anyone Korean.

05:11.354 --> 05:13.530
He's not racist.
He's too into it.

05:13.574 --> 05:15.445
And I wouldn't ride with Elias

05:15.489 --> 05:17.665
even if you promised
to murder my entire family.

05:17.708 --> 05:21.712
But, uh, other than those,
nice work.

05:23.584 --> 05:25.977
Are we acting like
we like each other?

05:26.021 --> 05:28.328

maybe I'm...

05:28.371 --> 05:29.981
annoying you
less than I used to.

05:30.025 --> 05:32.288

05:32.332 --> 05:33.550
Name three things I do

05:33.594 --> 05:35.073
that are actually annoying
to you.

05:35.117 --> 05:36.466
- Just three?
- And you can't say--

05:36.510 --> 05:37.772
can't say asking this question.

05:37.815 --> 05:39.251
That doesn't count.

have to do all of this.

you what to do, it's shrieking?

06:48.973 --> 06:50.322

about sexism.

07:25.183 --> 07:26.489
You got what you wanted.

I do a great Gail.

18:44.166 --> 18:45.211
- For each day of the week,

18:45.254 --> 18:46.951
each route has
three variations--

18:46.995 --> 18:48.388
one primary and two alternates

18:48.431 --> 18:50.955
based on shifts
and road closures.

18:50.999 --> 18:53.306
Now, if you're that week's
ride captain,

18:53.349 --> 18:57.136
it's your responsibility
to delegate and sub-delegate--

18:57.179 --> 18:59.660
- I'm sorry,
I don't want to carpool.

18:59.703 --> 19:01.879
- Well, why wouldn't you--

19:01.923 --> 19:03.490
- My drive is my
only "me" time.

19:03.533 --> 19:05.405
And I don't want
to clean my car.

19:05.448 --> 19:06.797
- I agree.

19:06.841 --> 19:08.364
This just seems like I'd
have to leave my house

19:08.408 --> 19:10.149
a lot earlier
and get home a lot later.

19:10.192 --> 19:11.367
- I need my car here.

19:11.411 --> 19:13.369
It's where I go
to cry at lunch.

19:20.855 --> 19:23.597
- I don't know, Mateo...
I'm starting to think

19:23.640 --> 19:26.034
that whole meeting
was a waste of time.

19:26.077 --> 19:27.296
- Cheyenne killed.

19:27.340 --> 19:29.820
- Hey, Glenn, uh,
I've been thinking.

19:29.864 --> 19:33.172
What if the problem wasn't
actually a toxic workplace

19:33.215 --> 19:36.218
but a toxic worker?

19:36.262 --> 19:39.874
- Elias is my brother-in-law.
Jerusha would kill me.

19:39.917 --> 19:41.049
- Oh, no, no, no.
That's not--

19:41.092 --> 19:43.747
no, I actually
was thinking Kelly.

19:43.791 --> 19:45.184
- Kelly?

19:45.227 --> 19:47.925
- She's negative,
she's unpleasant.

19:47.969 --> 19:49.536
- She kicked a child.

19:49.579 --> 19:51.320
- What?
- Well, that's not--

19:51.364 --> 19:53.322
I don't--
I don't know that to be true.

19:53.366 --> 19:55.846
But I do think
that Kelly is the problem.

19:55.890 --> 19:58.284
I mean, think about it.
Before she worked here,

19:58.327 --> 20:00.895
did you think
of this place as toxic?

20:00.938 --> 20:03.202
- No.
- And what about now?

20:05.029 --> 20:06.988
- Oh, my God.

20:07.031 --> 20:08.424
- So it's just over?

20:08.468 --> 20:12.036
- I'm sorry.
I tried as hard as I could.

20:12.080 --> 20:14.256
- Did you say best
two out of three?

20:14.300 --> 20:18.217
- No... I wish
I had thought of that.

20:18.260 --> 20:20.088
- I wish you had too.

20:22.395 --> 20:24.614
I'll always love you.

20:24.658 --> 20:28.575
- That doesn't matter.
You're with Carol now.

20:31.404 --> 20:33.667
- Can we still be friends?

20:33.710 --> 20:35.190
- Carol said no.

20:40.717 --> 20:43.198
- I don't appreciate
you trashing me

20:43.242 --> 20:44.808
and laughing behind my back.

20:44.852 --> 20:47.724
- I never laugh at you, Jonah.
You never say anything funny.

20:47.768 --> 20:49.465
- Oh, hey,
there's nobody else around.

20:49.509 --> 20:50.901
We can stop.

20:50.945 --> 20:53.252
Do you, uh, do you feel like
seeing a movie tonight?

20:53.295 --> 20:54.775
- No I don't feel like
seeing a movie right now.

20:54.818 --> 20:56.385
- I just said
there's nobody around.

20:56.429 --> 20:57.865
We don't have to fight anymore.

20:57.908 --> 20:59.867
- Okay, well I can't just
switch it off on a dime.

20:59.910 --> 21:01.869
- So are we still fighting?

21:01.912 --> 21:03.044
- Yeah, kind of.

21:03.087 --> 21:04.915
Just give me a minute.
It'll fade.

21:04.959 --> 21:08.267
- Take all the time you need--
- Don't tell me what to do.

21:08.310 --> 21:10.486
- Well, good luck
to you, Kelly.

21:10.530 --> 21:13.402
- Thank you, Glenn.
Bye!

21:13.446 --> 21:15.665
- Bye!
- Bye, Kel!

21:15.709 --> 21:18.015
- Good luck
to the Fenton store.

21:18.059 --> 21:19.974
They are going to need it.

21:20.017 --> 21:22.193
