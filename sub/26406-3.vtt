WEBVTT

00:04.265 --> 00:04.482
.

00:04.526 --> 00:06.267
- Okay, I'll go in first.

00:06.310 --> 00:08.008
- Wait, maybe I should
go in first.

00:08.051 --> 00:09.096
- It doesn't matter
who goes in first.

00:09.139 --> 00:10.271
We just can't go in together,

00:10.314 --> 00:11.489
'cause it's gonna
look suspicious.

00:11.533 --> 00:13.143
- Well then,
if it doesn't matter,

00:13.187 --> 00:14.362
I'll go in first.
- That's fine, go in first.

00:14.405 --> 00:16.146
I'm happy to sit here
for ten minutes

00:16.190 --> 00:17.626
and listen to the radio.
- Okay, no, you go in first.

00:17.669 --> 00:18.627
- Oh.
- Amy.

00:18.670 --> 00:20.324
Hey. Listen.

00:20.368 --> 00:22.022
Sorry for accidentally
texting you that nude.

00:22.065 --> 00:23.849
- No worries.

00:23.893 --> 00:25.025
- What's Jonah doing in there?

00:25.068 --> 00:27.462
- Oh, hey, Dina.
Uh, I was just

00:27.505 --> 00:29.725
looking for this
Del Taco receipt

00:29.768 --> 00:32.075
for 12 tacos.

00:32.119 --> 00:33.946
- You must have been
very hungry. No judgment.

00:33.990 --> 00:36.166
- So did you two
drive together?

00:36.210 --> 00:38.299
- Um, yes? We did.

00:38.342 --> 00:40.605
We are carpooling
to save some money.

00:40.649 --> 00:41.737
- And the environment.

00:41.780 --> 00:43.043
- Well, saving money
is reason enough.

00:43.086 --> 00:44.174
No need to keep explaining.

00:44.218 --> 00:45.567
- What's going on?

00:45.610 --> 00:47.351
- Nothing!
- Maybe we should get inside?

00:47.395 --> 00:49.223
- Amy and Jonah are carpooling.

00:49.266 --> 00:51.355
- Oh! I'm in.
Carpool karaoke.

00:51.399 --> 00:52.922
- What's carpool karaoke?

00:52.965 --> 00:56.404
- You know how people like
to sing in the car? That.

00:56.447 --> 00:58.362
- Well, that settles that.
Dina, you're blocking my door.

00:58.406 --> 01:01.713
- Hey, Sayeed!
Amy and Jonah are carpooling!

01:01.757 --> 01:03.889
- Whoo! Carpool Karaoke!

01:03.933 --> 01:06.109
- That's what I said!
[laughs]

01:06.153 --> 01:07.284
- That's what she said!

01:07.328 --> 01:09.721
- That's... wild.

01:09.765 --> 01:12.724
[upbeat music]

01:12.768 --> 01:14.770
â™ª

01:14.813 --> 01:17.468
- It doesn't make any sense.
Why are you guys carpooling

01:17.512 --> 01:19.340
when you live so far apart?

01:19.383 --> 01:21.124
You literally have to drive
past the store

01:21.168 --> 01:22.734
to pick each other up.

01:22.778 --> 01:25.302
- I'm surprised this hasn't
occurred to either one of you

01:25.346 --> 01:28.392
during your long morning drives
to each other's houses.

01:28.436 --> 01:31.395
- You know what, Cheyenne?
You are really good

01:31.439 --> 01:33.136
at this logistics stuff.
You should be planning

01:33.180 --> 01:34.398
everybody's carpools.

01:34.442 --> 01:35.791
- Really? You think so?

01:35.834 --> 01:37.445
- Yeah, you're really great
at it.

01:37.488 --> 01:39.229
- You have a gift
for logistics.

01:39.273 --> 01:42.493
- Oh, because I could. I mean,
I could do it right now.

01:42.537 --> 01:46.845
- Now would be great.
- Okay. I'm gonna.

01:46.889 --> 01:48.238
- Get it, girl!

01:50.458 --> 01:52.373
- Why don't you just tell
everybody you're dating?

01:52.416 --> 01:54.462
This is the most boring secret
I've ever had to live with.

01:54.505 --> 01:56.116
- We don't need everybody
in our business, okay?

01:56.159 --> 01:57.769
This place loves gossip.

01:57.813 --> 01:59.119
- Well, at least get better
about hiding it.

01:59.162 --> 02:00.424
- What are you talking about?

02:00.468 --> 02:01.860
We're not acting different
around each other.

02:01.904 --> 02:03.166
- I mean, it's obvious to me,

02:03.210 --> 02:05.342
but I'm more perceptive
than most.

02:05.386 --> 02:07.649
Most people didn't even notice
that Henry and Jay

02:07.692 --> 02:09.216
have been hooking up.

02:09.259 --> 02:12.175
I mean, it seems obvious to me.

02:12.219 --> 02:14.264
- There's an opening
at the Fenton's store,

02:14.308 --> 02:16.223
and they said
that I could transfer.

02:16.266 --> 02:19.139
You just need to sign
this form.

02:21.532 --> 02:23.621
- Wait, is this about Jonah?

02:23.665 --> 02:25.884
Because I can make him
take you back, okay?

02:25.928 --> 02:28.452
Yeah, I'm his boss.
He's gotta do what I say.

02:28.496 --> 02:32.108
- That's so generous of you
to offer

02:32.152 --> 02:34.328
to force someone to be with me.

02:34.371 --> 02:36.895
Makes me feel really good
about myself.

02:36.939 --> 02:38.375
- It should.

02:38.419 --> 02:40.160
- Uh, but no,
this isn't about Jonah.

02:40.203 --> 02:43.728
I mean, the Fenton location is
just a lot closer to my house.

02:43.772 --> 02:48.037
- Well, if everyone only worked
at places that were close

02:48.080 --> 02:52.998
to their house, then I'd only
work at my neighbor's.

02:53.042 --> 02:54.870
- Yeah, that's a good point.

02:54.913 --> 02:57.525
- Should we get a scented
candle for our nightstand?

02:57.568 --> 02:58.569
- Yeah.

02:58.613 --> 03:00.092
- This one smells like
peanut butter.

03:00.136 --> 03:02.921
- Oh!
[laughs]

03:02.965 --> 03:05.185
I already got a jelly one.

03:05.228 --> 03:07.230
- PB&J.
- [laughs]

03:07.274 --> 03:09.232
- Jay!

03:09.276 --> 03:10.581
What are you doing here?

03:12.583 --> 03:15.238
- Jerry and I
are moving in together.

03:15.282 --> 03:18.937
- Oh. Wow.
Congratulations, Sandra.

03:18.981 --> 03:21.549
Enjoy my HPV.

03:23.246 --> 03:24.682
- Thank you.

03:24.726 --> 03:28.251
- Hey, Mateo,
how many times in a row

03:28.295 --> 03:30.514
have you been
employee of the month again?

03:30.558 --> 03:32.647
- Oh, I don't even keep track.

03:32.690 --> 03:35.519
- I think it's at least three--
- Five, it's five. Five.

03:35.563 --> 03:37.739
- Wow. That's a good run.

03:37.782 --> 03:42.396
Um, Kelly wants to transfer
to a different store,

03:42.439 --> 03:45.094
and I was thinking
maybe it's because

03:45.137 --> 03:47.270
she doesn't feel
appreciated here.

03:47.314 --> 03:49.533
So, then I was thinking,

03:49.577 --> 03:53.581
"What if we made her Employee
of the Month this month?"

03:53.624 --> 03:55.713
- Like, both of us
at the same time?

03:55.757 --> 03:58.847
- Well, maybe just her,
you know, as a token,

03:58.890 --> 04:01.110
to make her feel special.

04:01.153 --> 04:03.808
- Ah. What a cool idea.

04:03.852 --> 04:05.419
- Thank you.

04:05.462 --> 04:06.768
- So we would take it
away from me--

04:06.811 --> 04:08.726
- Yup.
- And give it to her.

04:08.770 --> 04:10.075
- Yes!

04:10.119 --> 04:11.686
- Love that, so much.

04:11.729 --> 04:12.948
- Great.

04:12.991 --> 04:14.863
- Although I do wonder--
devil's advocate...

04:14.906 --> 04:15.907
- Mm-hmm?

04:15.951 --> 04:17.735
- If it somehow cheapens
the award

04:17.779 --> 04:20.912
by just handing it out
to anyone, if that makes sense.

04:20.956 --> 04:24.742
- Well, she's not just anyone.
I mean, Kelly is wonderful.

04:24.786 --> 04:27.354
- Oh! Absolutely.
Without a doubt.

04:27.397 --> 04:29.007
Kelly's a delight.

04:29.051 --> 04:32.054
But at the same time,
she's also, you know,

04:32.097 --> 04:35.710
terrible... at the job.

04:35.753 --> 04:37.494
- Yeah.

04:37.538 --> 04:39.801
- I got a map and marked down
where everyone lived,

04:39.844 --> 04:42.107
and then I used logistics
to figure out

04:42.151 --> 04:43.935
the most efficient carpools.

04:43.979 --> 04:46.503
- Wow. You really put
a lot of effort into this.

04:46.547 --> 04:48.940
- Yeah, I haven't sold,
like, anything today.

04:48.984 --> 04:50.464
Like, nothing.

04:50.507 --> 04:53.031
- A few thoughts: you've got
Mark riding with Terrence.

04:53.075 --> 04:54.337
They hate each other.

04:54.381 --> 04:55.991
Sarah and Rob are going
through a divorce.

04:56.034 --> 04:59.690
Sarah had that secret family.
So did Rob.

04:59.734 --> 05:01.736
Um, see this line
between Heather and Cody?

05:01.779 --> 05:04.042
That's a river.
So how are they carpooling?

05:04.086 --> 05:05.609
Submarine? Yeah.

05:05.653 --> 05:08.133
Herman's riding with Rico,
but Rico's got BO,

05:08.177 --> 05:09.352
and Herman's dead.

05:09.396 --> 05:11.311
You can't put Phil
with anyone Korean.

05:11.354 --> 05:13.530
He's not racist.
He's too into it.

05:13.574 --> 05:15.445
And I wouldn't ride with Elias

05:15.489 --> 05:17.665
even if you promised
to murder my entire family.

05:17.708 --> 05:21.712
But, uh, other than those,
nice work.

05:21.756 --> 05:23.540
- Do you think Garret's right?

05:23.584 --> 05:25.977
Are we acting like
we like each other?

05:26.021 --> 05:28.328
- I don't know, I mean,
maybe I'm...

05:28.371 --> 05:29.981
annoying you
less than I used to.

05:30.025 --> 05:32.288
- Ah, no, that's not it.
- Oh, yeah?

05:32.332 --> 05:33.550
Name three things I do

05:33.594 --> 05:35.073
that are actually annoying
to you.

05:35.117 --> 05:36.466
- Just three?
- And you can't say--

05:36.510 --> 05:37.772
can't say asking this question.

05:37.815 --> 05:39.251
That doesn't count.
It's too easy.

05:39.295 --> 05:40.514
Okay, come on.
Let's hear 'em.

05:40.557 --> 05:41.993
- You know what?
Enough chit-chat.

05:42.037 --> 05:43.343
Get back to work.

05:43.386 --> 05:45.388
- What are you doing?
I'm just joking.

05:46.650 --> 05:48.826
I was working
until you interrupted me.

05:48.870 --> 05:51.742
- Just do your job, Jonah.
- You do your job, Amy.

05:51.786 --> 05:55.659
- I am doing my job--
telling you to do your job.

05:57.835 --> 06:00.360
- Not bad.
- That was good.

06:00.403 --> 06:02.144
- Today, we honor

06:02.187 --> 06:05.756
one of our most valued
and cherished employees.

06:05.800 --> 06:10.326
On behalf of store 1217,
it is my privilege

06:10.370 --> 06:14.243
to award the Golden Vest...

06:14.286 --> 06:15.853
to Kelly Watson!

06:15.897 --> 06:17.507
- What?

06:17.551 --> 06:19.683
- Wait.
The Golden Vest?

06:19.727 --> 06:24.035
- Yes. It's one of Cloud 9's
highest honors.

06:24.079 --> 06:26.168
- Oh, Glenn, you really don't
have to do all of this.

06:26.211 --> 06:29.650
- Shh.
The Golden Vest!

06:29.693 --> 06:31.826
[whispers]
Cheyenne.

06:31.869 --> 06:33.871
- Congratulations.
- Yay.

06:37.222 --> 06:37.614
.

06:37.658 --> 06:39.573
[irreverent pizzicato music]

06:39.616 --> 06:41.009
- Really, Jonah?

06:41.052 --> 06:43.533
You're spraying all-purpose
cleaner on the fruit?

06:43.577 --> 06:44.926
- You know what?
Chill out.

06:44.969 --> 06:47.058
I'll fix it, all right?
Stop shrieking.

06:47.102 --> 06:48.930
- Oh, so anytime a woman tells
you what to do, it's shrieking?

06:48.973 --> 06:50.322
- Oh, don't make this
about sexism.

06:50.366 --> 06:51.585
- Have you ever looked
in the mirror,

06:51.628 --> 06:52.847
listened to your own voice--

06:52.890 --> 06:54.457
- It's about being a lunatic!

06:54.501 --> 06:56.546
- Listen to yourself.
You're shrieking!

07:00.158 --> 07:02.204
God, I hate that guy.

07:05.120 --> 07:06.643
- So sparkly.

07:07.992 --> 07:09.864
- I'm sorry?

07:09.907 --> 07:12.432
- All these months.
Playing dumb.

07:12.475 --> 07:13.868
Just playing so dumb.

07:13.911 --> 07:15.522
All the time!
[chuckles]

07:15.565 --> 07:18.742
Well, you knew
exactly what you were doing.

07:18.786 --> 07:20.962
You were going for the gold.

07:21.005 --> 07:22.964
- Are you talking
about the vest?

07:23.007 --> 07:25.140
- You can drop the act,
Helen Mirren.

07:25.183 --> 07:26.489
You got what you wanted.

07:26.533 --> 07:27.795
- Mateo, you know
that this is just

07:27.838 --> 07:29.971
some silly
made-up award, right?

07:30.014 --> 07:31.755
I mean, it's completely
meaningless.

07:31.799 --> 07:34.279
It's like
Employee of the Month.

07:35.759 --> 07:38.501
- You are the most petty,
jealous, and bitter person

07:38.545 --> 07:40.155
I've ever met.

07:43.114 --> 07:46.074
- [sighs]

07:46.117 --> 07:48.990
I gotta get the [bleep]
out of here.

07:49.033 --> 07:51.514
- Need help
finding anything, Jer-Bear?

07:51.558 --> 07:52.950
- Yeah, I'm looking
for some art

07:52.994 --> 07:54.996
with just, like, words on it.

07:55.039 --> 07:59.130
Like maybe it says dream
or cat or merlot.

07:59.174 --> 08:01.219
I don't know,
I'm not an artist.

08:01.263 --> 08:03.004
- Let's see what we can find.

08:04.701 --> 08:06.616
You look amazing, by the way.

08:06.660 --> 08:08.662
What have you lost,
like, 10 pounds?

08:08.705 --> 08:11.316
- I don't know.
I've never weighed myself.

08:11.360 --> 08:13.405
- [laughs]

08:13.449 --> 08:15.538
You are so funny!

08:15.582 --> 08:17.888
You make me laugh
harder than anybody!

08:17.932 --> 08:21.283
I mean, I am laughing
so hard, I am crying.

08:21.326 --> 08:22.502
[laughs]

08:22.545 --> 08:25.635
Oh. Oh, sorry.

08:25.679 --> 08:27.681
I forgot I wasn't
wearing a bra.

08:27.724 --> 08:29.726
- Uh, that's okay.

08:29.770 --> 08:34.252
- I am so embarrassed.
Don't look at my face.

08:37.081 --> 08:39.214
- Nobody cares about your
obnoxious opinions, Jonah!

08:39.257 --> 08:40.520
- Oh, obnoxious!

08:40.563 --> 08:42.609
That's a pretty big word
for you, Amy!

08:42.652 --> 08:44.741
- Oh, sure,
keep on calling me dumb,

08:44.785 --> 08:49.790
you slick-haired, insecure,
sad little fancy boy.

08:49.833 --> 08:51.226
- What an insulting

08:51.269 --> 08:54.882
and antiquated thing
for you to say to me.

08:54.925 --> 08:56.623
You know what?
If I'm a fancy boy,

08:56.666 --> 08:58.712
you know what you are?
- No, what am I?

08:58.755 --> 09:01.715
- You are a loud-mouthed,
domineering, crazy little--

09:01.758 --> 09:03.586
[whispering] Is bitch too--
- No, it's good.

09:03.630 --> 09:05.719
- Bitch!

09:05.762 --> 09:06.981
Yeah, I said it.

09:07.024 --> 09:09.244
- Don't you use that word
with me!

09:09.287 --> 09:10.506
Take this!

09:10.550 --> 09:11.899
- Ow!

09:11.942 --> 09:14.162
You shoved me, Amy!
What is wrong with you?

09:14.205 --> 09:15.685
- Yeah, I did.

09:15.729 --> 09:17.165
What are you gonna do
about it, you wuss?

09:17.208 --> 09:18.862
Ow!

09:20.342 --> 09:24.433
Um, why would you
slam my clipboard

09:24.476 --> 09:25.739
on the floor like that?

09:25.782 --> 09:27.828
- Nice pivot.

09:27.871 --> 09:30.526
- And then I realized
that Dom always says

09:30.570 --> 09:33.050
creepy things to women
when he's alone with them.

09:33.094 --> 09:35.923
So I had him pick up Jarrett
before Amanda.

09:35.966 --> 09:38.490
But then the problem was,
who is driving Debbie?

09:38.534 --> 09:40.884
And then I remembered,
Debbie had that cocaine problem

09:40.928 --> 09:42.973
so she can't smell a thing.

09:43.017 --> 09:47.108
Which brings us back
to Kyle the farter.

09:48.196 --> 09:49.893
Boom.

09:49.937 --> 09:51.460
- Now, you know
a lot of these people

09:51.503 --> 09:53.331
don't work
the same shift, right?

09:55.377 --> 09:57.466
- Thank you for bringing that
to my attention.

09:57.509 --> 10:00.121
- I mean, they wouldn't even be
at the store at the same time.

10:00.164 --> 10:01.992
- Okay, yeah, I get your point.

10:03.254 --> 10:04.299
- Hey!

10:04.342 --> 10:06.431
- Keep your saggy boobs
to yourself.

10:06.475 --> 10:08.956
- Oops.
Did Jerry say something?

10:08.999 --> 10:10.958
I didn't hear him complain
at the time.

10:11.001 --> 10:15.136
- That's because
he's very soft-spoken.

10:15.179 --> 10:16.267
- Ow. Stop.

10:16.311 --> 10:17.878
- You stop.

10:21.316 --> 10:24.319
- There she is.
Mrs. Golden Vest.

10:24.362 --> 10:25.973
She's the best.

10:26.016 --> 10:29.150
- Did you sign
my transfer papers yet?

10:29.193 --> 10:31.282
- But you won the Golden Vest.

10:31.326 --> 10:32.675
- Glenn.

10:32.719 --> 10:34.459
- Come on, don't leave us.

10:34.503 --> 10:36.679
I mean, I know it's not
a perfect workplace,

10:36.723 --> 10:38.812
but we love each other here.

10:38.855 --> 10:41.945
- Keep your hands off him!
He's mine!

10:41.989 --> 10:45.296
- Excuse me, I've got to go
stop the love.

10:46.254 --> 10:48.691
- Oh, great,
working next to Amy.

10:48.735 --> 10:51.346
I can't wait to be scowled at.
- No!

10:51.389 --> 10:53.087
You do not talk
to my best friend that way.

10:53.130 --> 10:54.610
- No, Dina--
- Butt out, Amy.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.699
Listen to me, you rejected
American Girl doll.

10:56.743 --> 10:58.396
You think you're so great?

10:58.440 --> 11:00.181
Your boyish good looks
aren't gonna age well.

11:00.224 --> 11:01.661
You're hitting a wall,
pretty boy,

11:01.704 --> 11:02.836
at a hundred miles an hour.

11:02.879 --> 11:04.533
Yeah, you can already see it.

11:04.576 --> 11:07.797
The crow's feet,
receding hairline, hunchback.

11:07.841 --> 11:09.886
To think I used to
masturbate to you.

11:09.930 --> 11:11.148
â™ª

11:11.192 --> 11:12.410
- Oh.
- Multiple times a day.

11:15.587 --> 11:15.762
.

11:15.805 --> 11:18.068
- What is going on
in this store?

11:18.112 --> 11:19.635
- Jonah and Amy are
at each other's throats.

11:19.679 --> 11:22.682
Somebody started a Twitter
campaign, #GoldenVestSoWhite.

11:22.725 --> 11:25.336
I mean, it's just
been tense lately.

11:25.380 --> 11:26.947
- It must be my fault.

11:26.990 --> 11:31.342
It's like they say,
the fish rots from the head.

11:31.386 --> 11:33.431
- What are you talking about?

11:33.475 --> 11:36.086
- It's the expression.
Fish rots from the head.

11:36.130 --> 11:37.261
- I've never heard of that.

11:37.305 --> 11:38.567
Why would it rot
from the head first?

11:38.610 --> 11:40.177
It would all rot
simultaneously.

11:40.221 --> 11:42.353
- The point is,
if things are toxic here,

11:42.397 --> 11:44.268
it's my job to fix it.

11:44.312 --> 11:45.922
- If anything,
the guts would rot first,

11:45.966 --> 11:47.141
they're full of feces.

11:47.184 --> 11:48.708
Where are you getting
this head thing?

11:48.751 --> 11:50.927
I mean, whoever told you that
was not an ichthyologist.

11:50.971 --> 11:52.755
- I don't care how a fish rots.

11:52.799 --> 11:55.105
- Well, I don't care for you
spreading lies about fish.

11:55.149 --> 11:56.628
- How is that a lie?

11:56.672 --> 11:59.806
[tinny music playing
over stereo]

11:59.849 --> 12:04.636
â™ª

12:04.680 --> 12:07.465
A toxic workplace
is a workplace

12:07.509 --> 12:10.947
where an employee feels
both unhappy and unwelcome.

12:10.991 --> 12:12.949
Now, what could cause that?

12:12.993 --> 12:15.473
- Uh, your supervisor being
a giant pain in the ass?

12:15.517 --> 12:18.563
- Oh, wow, Jonah had
a little comment, shocking.

12:18.607 --> 12:21.262
- Wow. Those two
really don't get along.

12:21.305 --> 12:23.220
- Well, no, no,
this is a perfect example.

12:23.264 --> 12:25.135
Like, you need to
communicate better.

12:25.179 --> 12:27.311
Look, let's practice.

12:27.355 --> 12:29.444
Who wants to say
something critical about me?

12:29.487 --> 12:32.316
- Oh! Oh, Oh, Oh.
Pick me.

12:32.360 --> 12:34.275
Pick me.
I've got so many.

12:34.318 --> 12:35.711
- Uh...
- Come on.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.104
- Anyone? Amy!

12:37.147 --> 12:40.890
Why don't you say
what you don't like about me?

12:40.934 --> 12:44.241
-Um, no, there really
isn't anything.

12:44.285 --> 12:47.723
- Oh, come on.
I'm not made of glass.

12:47.767 --> 12:50.813
- Uh, okay.
[clears throat]

12:50.857 --> 12:53.381
I guess if I had to
make a complaint,

12:53.424 --> 12:55.339
because you're forcing me to,

12:55.383 --> 13:01.737
I don't love the way
you pronounce "measure."

13:03.652 --> 13:05.349
- Mm-hmm.

13:05.393 --> 13:06.873
Okay. Good.

13:09.571 --> 13:12.269
It's just... kind of hard
to shake off here.

13:12.313 --> 13:15.577
Really took the wind
out of me, but...

13:17.927 --> 13:21.844
Okay, we're back, okay.
All right, moving on, um...

13:24.847 --> 13:27.589
No, I'm gonna need
another minute.

13:29.504 --> 13:33.073
[light music plays]

13:33.116 --> 13:39.470
â™ª

13:39.514 --> 13:42.038
Okay, so one way
to deal with conflict

13:42.082 --> 13:46.738
is to try and see it from the
other person's point of view.

13:46.782 --> 13:50.786
Uh, for example, these two
had a terrible breakup,

13:50.830 --> 13:54.050
which left Kelly feeling
a lot of pain.

13:54.094 --> 13:58.098
So, Kelly, I want you
to imagine that you're Jonah,

13:58.141 --> 14:03.277
and I want you, Jonah, to tell
Kelly how you're feeling.

14:03.320 --> 14:05.453
Yeah, you can do this.

14:06.933 --> 14:11.894
- Okay, uh, Kelly, I'm sorry
I was such a bad boyfriend.

14:11.938 --> 14:15.202
But I also realize
that you should be able

14:15.245 --> 14:18.640
to transfer stores
if you want to.

14:18.683 --> 14:20.903
- Um, yeah.
That-that was okay.

14:20.947 --> 14:23.253
You know, it's always
a little rough at first.

14:23.297 --> 14:28.432
Now, Kelly, I want you to tell
Jonah what you're feeling.

14:28.476 --> 14:29.825
- You know what--
actually, I'm sorry--

14:29.869 --> 14:31.305
could you have them
switch clothes?

14:31.348 --> 14:33.002
It would help me visualize it.

14:33.046 --> 14:35.439
- That's interesting.

14:35.483 --> 14:38.878
- I'm just gonna do it
like this, okay?

14:38.921 --> 14:43.795
Jonah, I don't feel
you were fair to me--

14:43.839 --> 14:45.841
- Wait a minute.
This sounds nothing like Kelly.

14:45.885 --> 14:46.973
It's more like...

14:47.016 --> 14:48.800
[high-pitched]
Hi, everybody! I'm Kelly!

14:48.844 --> 14:51.847
Nope. Wait. Hold on.
Let's do this.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.588
Nice and accurate.
How about it?

14:53.631 --> 14:56.199
- Dina, it's not about
doing impressions.

14:56.243 --> 14:57.635
- Hey, it's me, Kelly!

14:57.679 --> 15:00.073
Boy, it sure is
windy out today.

15:00.116 --> 15:02.075
Whoa!

15:02.118 --> 15:03.641
- That seems unnecessary.

15:03.685 --> 15:04.904
- Jonah, you told me
you loved me.

15:04.947 --> 15:06.470
And then you dumped me
so that you could

15:06.514 --> 15:07.950
have sex
with that pregnant whore.

15:07.994 --> 15:09.343
- Hey!

15:09.386 --> 15:10.648
- These are Kelly's words.
Not mine.

15:10.692 --> 15:12.085
- I don't sound like that.

15:12.128 --> 15:13.695
- It's a little more squeaky,
like...

15:13.738 --> 15:15.566
[high-pitched]
Hey, everybody, I'm Kelly!

15:15.610 --> 15:16.828
- No, it's more like...

15:16.872 --> 15:19.396
[high-pitched]
Hi, everybody, I'm Kelly!

15:19.440 --> 15:21.355
- [high-pitched]
Hi, everyone, I'm Kelly!

15:21.398 --> 15:22.530
- It's your girl, Kelly!

15:22.573 --> 15:26.099
[all impersonating Kelly]

15:29.537 --> 15:32.409
[light music plays]

15:32.453 --> 15:37.849
â™ª

15:37.893 --> 15:39.416
- [as Fran Drescher]
Oh, my God.

15:39.460 --> 15:42.158
These customers
are so handsome.

15:42.202 --> 15:44.204
How am I supposed
to work checkout?

15:44.247 --> 15:47.424
I'm too busy checking them out.

15:47.468 --> 15:49.861
- Okay.
Thank you, Cheyenne.

15:49.905 --> 15:51.951
Now we know what
it would sound like

15:51.994 --> 15:54.040
if Fran Drescher worked
at Cloud 9.

15:54.083 --> 15:55.693
- Ah. That was so good.

15:55.737 --> 15:57.478
- [as Fran Drescher]
Aww, thanks, doll.

15:57.521 --> 15:59.349
- I don't understand
how this is helping.

15:59.393 --> 16:01.047
- I don't even know anymore.

16:01.090 --> 16:03.571
- Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Who is this?

16:03.614 --> 16:07.923
I'm Sandra, and I'm a dirty
slut who goes around

16:07.967 --> 16:10.534
stealing other people's
boyfriends.

16:10.578 --> 16:12.101
- Oh, yeah?
Well, who is this?

16:12.145 --> 16:15.017
I'm Carol, I'm a jealous
psycho stalker who can't take

16:15.061 --> 16:17.541
the fact that Jerry
chose Sandra over me.

16:17.585 --> 16:18.890
And now
they're moving in together,

16:18.934 --> 16:20.849
and they're gonna be
so happy.

16:20.892 --> 16:25.245
And I'll be alone.
Which is sad.

16:25.288 --> 16:27.769
Because maybe I was happy
with Jerry.

16:27.812 --> 16:29.640
But Sandra didn't care
about my feelings.

16:29.684 --> 16:32.034
She just took what she wanted.

16:32.078 --> 16:35.385
Which people have
always done to her.

16:35.429 --> 16:39.694
Maybe I only seem crazy
because I'm lonely.

16:39.737 --> 16:45.961
Just a person who had love,
and now it's gone.

16:48.355 --> 16:51.619
- Wow, Sandra.

16:51.662 --> 16:54.535
That was--
good breakthrough.

16:54.578 --> 16:55.753
- Yeah, but that didn't
solve anything.

16:55.797 --> 16:57.059
- It's not about solving.

16:57.103 --> 17:00.062
It's about communication
and empathy.

17:00.106 --> 17:03.283
- Screw empathy.
I want Jerry back.

17:03.326 --> 17:04.893
- What? No.

17:04.936 --> 17:07.026
- Finders keepers.
That is the law.

17:07.069 --> 17:08.592
- I think she should
give him back.

17:08.636 --> 17:09.811
- How do we decide?

17:09.854 --> 17:11.247
- We could let Jerry decide.

17:11.291 --> 17:12.335
- How about we flip a coin?

17:12.379 --> 17:13.815
Winner takes Jerry, agreed?

17:13.858 --> 17:15.077
- No, I don't think--
- I'm good with that.

17:15.121 --> 17:16.165
- You guys, this is crazy.

17:16.209 --> 17:17.775
- Let the coin do its work.

17:17.819 --> 17:19.255
- Guys, listen, I'm not
agreeing to give Jerry up.

17:19.299 --> 17:21.953
- Sandra, call it in the air.
- No, no, heads!

17:21.997 --> 17:24.304
- Tails.
Carol, he's all yours.

17:24.347 --> 17:25.348
- Yes!

So good.

17:37.273 --> 17:40.146
- Hey, how's it going?

17:40.189 --> 17:43.192
- Well, should I answer that
as Jonah or Kelly?

17:43.236 --> 17:46.239
I don't do a really good Jonah.
How is your Kelly?

17:46.282 --> 17:49.590
- [as Kelly]
Hey, everybody, I'm Kelly.

17:49.633 --> 17:51.983
- [laughs]

17:52.027 --> 17:54.725
- Um, you were right.

17:54.769 --> 17:58.468
I-I was a bad boyfriend.

17:58.512 --> 18:00.514
I'm sorry.

18:00.557 --> 18:05.171
But I hope that's not
the reason you're leaving.

18:06.259 --> 18:08.696
- It's--I don't know.

18:08.739 --> 18:11.046
It's just time
for me to move on.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.700
Try something new.

18:12.743 --> 18:15.529
Like, um, like, what's
it like to stock flatware

18:15.572 --> 18:18.184
at a different Cloud 9?
I want to find out.

18:18.227 --> 18:19.968
- I can't even imagine.

18:20.011 --> 18:21.230
- It doesn't matter anyway.

18:21.274 --> 18:24.146
I can't get Glenn
to sign the transfer.

18:24.190 --> 18:27.149
[as Glenn] Because we're
a family, and I'm a man baby

18:27.193 --> 18:29.760
who won't let anyone leave!

18:29.804 --> 18:31.284
I can do impressions too.

18:34.200 --> 18:36.854
- I can do impressions too.
- Oh, yeah?

18:36.898 --> 18:40.162
- Yeah, do you know Gail?
- Uh, no?

18:40.206 --> 18:42.556
- Ah, too bad.
I do a great Gail.

18:44.166 --> 18:45.211
- For each day of the week,

18:45.254 --> 18:46.951
each route has
three variations--

18:46.995 --> 18:48.388
one primary and two alternates

18:48.431 --> 18:50.955
based on shifts
and road closures.

18:50.999 --> 18:53.306
Now, if you're that week's
ride captain,

18:53.349 --> 18:57.136
it's your responsibility
to delegate and sub-delegate--

18:57.179 --> 18:59.660
- I'm sorry,
I don't want to carpool.

18:59.703 --> 19:01.879
- Well, why wouldn't you--

19:01.923 --> 19:03.490
- My drive is my
only "me" time.

19:03.533 --> 19:05.405
And I don't want
to clean my car.

19:05.448 --> 19:06.797
- I agree.

19:06.841 --> 19:08.364
This just seems like I'd
have to leave my house

19:08.408 --> 19:10.149
a lot earlier
and get home a lot later.

19:10.192 --> 19:11.367
- I need my car here.

19:11.411 --> 19:13.369
It's where I go
to cry at lunch.

19:20.855 --> 19:23.597
- I don't know, Mateo...
I'm starting to think

19:23.640 --> 19:26.034
that whole meeting
was a waste of time.

19:26.077 --> 19:27.296
- Cheyenne killed.

19:27.340 --> 19:29.820
- Hey, Glenn, uh,
I've been thinking.

19:29.864 --> 19:33.172
What if the problem wasn't
actually a toxic workplace

19:33.215 --> 19:36.218
but a toxic worker?

19:36.262 --> 19:39.874
- Elias is my brother-in-law.
Jerusha would kill me.

19:39.917 --> 19:41.049
- Oh, no, no, no.
That's not--

19:41.092 --> 19:43.747
no, I actually
was thinking Kelly.

19:43.791 --> 19:45.184
- Kelly?

19:45.227 --> 19:47.925
- She's negative,
she's unpleasant.

19:47.969 --> 19:49.536
- She kicked a child.

19:49.579 --> 19:51.320
- What?
- Well, that's not--

19:51.364 --> 19:53.322
I don't--
I don't know that to be true.

19:53.366 --> 19:55.846
But I do think
that Kelly is the problem.

19:55.890 --> 19:58.284
I mean, think about it.
Before she worked here,

19:58.327 --> 20:00.895
did you think
of this place as toxic?

20:00.938 --> 20:03.202
- No.
- And what about now?

20:05.029 --> 20:06.988
- Oh, my God.

20:07.031 --> 20:08.424
- So it's just over?

20:08.468 --> 20:12.036
- I'm sorry.
I tried as hard as I could.

20:12.080 --> 20:14.256
- Did you say best
two out of three?

20:14.300 --> 20:18.217
- No... I wish
I had thought of that.

20:18.260 --> 20:20.088
- I wish you had too.

20:22.395 --> 20:24.614
I'll always love you.

20:24.658 --> 20:28.575
- That doesn't matter.
You're with Carol now.

20:31.404 --> 20:33.667
- Can we still be friends?

20:33.710 --> 20:35.190
- Carol said no.

20:40.717 --> 20:43.198
- I don't appreciate
you trashing me

20:43.242 --> 20:44.808
and laughing behind my back.

20:44.852 --> 20:47.724
- I never laugh at you, Jonah.
You never say anything funny.

20:47.768 --> 20:49.465
- Oh, hey,
there's nobody else around.

20:49.509 --> 20:50.901
We can stop.

20:50.945 --> 20:53.252
Do you, uh, do you feel like
seeing a movie tonight?

20:53.295 --> 20:54.775
- No I don't feel like
seeing a movie right now.

20:54.818 --> 20:56.385
- I just said
there's nobody around.

20:56.429 --> 20:57.865
We don't have to fight anymore.

20:57.908 --> 20:59.867
- Okay, well I can't just
switch it off on a dime.

20:59.910 --> 21:01.869
- So are we still fighting?

21:01.912 --> 21:03.044
- Yeah, kind of.

21:03.087 --> 21:04.915
Just give me a minute.
It'll fade.

21:04.959 --> 21:08.267
- Take all the time you need--
- Don't tell me what to do.

21:08.310 --> 21:10.486
- Well, good luck
to you, Kelly.

21:10.530 --> 21:13.402
- Thank you, Glenn.
Bye!

21:13.446 --> 21:15.665
- Bye!
- Bye, Kel!

21:15.709 --> 21:18.015
- Good luck
to the Fenton store.

21:18.059 --> 21:19.974
They are going to need it.

21:20.017 --> 21:22.193
