00:02.961 --> 00:05.715
Guys! Guys! I've got great news.
Guess what.

00:05.881 --> 00:08.259
- Uh, Monica's pregnant!
- Really?

00:10.720 --> 00:12.805
Let's get past the moment.

00:13.180 --> 00:14.849
- What's your news?
- Thank you.

00:15.266 --> 00:17.268
I got a job in advertising.

00:17.435 --> 00:20.479
- Oh, honey, that's incredible!
- Wow.

00:20.688 --> 00:23.441
Gosh, what's the pay like?

00:25.443 --> 00:27.737
Oh, come on, people.

00:27.903 --> 00:29.905
If I don't know who makes the most...

00:30.072 --> 00:32.616
...how do I know who
I like the most? Hi, Joey.

00:35.161 --> 00:37.121
It pays nothing. It's an internship.

00:37.329 --> 00:39.206
We have interns at Days of our Lives.

00:39.415 --> 00:42.460
Right. So it'll be the same,
except less sex with you.

00:44.420 --> 00:46.589
So, uh, what do you think
they'll have you do there?

00:46.756 --> 00:49.925
It's a training program,
but they hire the people they like.

00:50.092 --> 00:53.095
- That's great!
- There's gonna be some grunt work...

00:53.262 --> 00:56.891
...which will stink. A grown man
getting people coffee is humiliating.

00:59.769 --> 01:02.354
Humiliating and noble.

01:03.314 --> 01:05.232
Thank you.

01:06.901 --> 01:09.070
You know, if I didn't already
have a job...

01:09.236 --> 01:11.322
...I would've been good in advertising.

01:11.489 --> 01:14.241
Ross, you did not come up with
"got milk?"

01:14.408 --> 01:16.410
Yes, I did! I did!

01:18.412 --> 01:21.123
I should've written it down.

02:12.341 --> 02:13.384
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:13.551 --> 02:16.804
Where's Chandler? I wanna wish him
good luck on his first day.

02:17.012 --> 02:19.473
And I smelled bacon. Ha, ha.

02:20.141 --> 02:22.893
- He just left.
- Who did?

02:24.728 --> 02:27.189
Joey, you're never gonna
believe it! She called!

02:27.398 --> 02:28.941
- She did'?
- You got it!

02:29.108 --> 02:30.776
- I did?
- What is she talking about?

02:30.985 --> 02:33.195
I don't know, but it sounds great!

02:33.362 --> 02:35.531
No, your agent called.
You got that audition!

02:35.739 --> 02:37.074
- With Leonard Hayes?
- Yes!

02:37.241 --> 02:40.953
Oh, my God, that is great!
It's for a play on Broadway.

02:41.120 --> 02:45.249
And in a real theater. Not that little one
underneath the deli like last time.

02:45.457 --> 02:47.084
- Is it a good play'?
- It must be.

02:47.251 --> 02:49.420
I read it and didn't
understand a single word!

02:51.046 --> 02:53.757
- Leonard Hayes is starring in it.
- Yeah, and directing.

02:53.924 --> 02:56.427
Oh, he was so good
in that movie of Macbeth.

02:56.635 --> 03:00.431
- You saw that?
- No, but I saw the previews.

03:00.598 --> 03:02.641
- They played it right before Jackass.
- Ah.

03:02.808 --> 03:04.268
Oh, yeah, yeah. He has.

03:04.435 --> 03:06.395
- He's done some amazing work.
- Oh, yeah.

03:06.562 --> 03:08.731
Oh, I loved him
in those phone commercials.

03:08.898 --> 03:12.776
When the monkey hits him in the face
with the giant rubber phone. Ha-ha-ha.

03:12.943 --> 03:14.904
Maybe the monkey
will be at the audition.

03:15.112 --> 03:17.406
Don't make me more nervous
than I already am!

03:27.833 --> 03:30.586
- Good morning.
- Can I get you a cup of coffee, sir?

03:30.753 --> 03:33.714
Oh, no, no. I'm an intern,
just like you guys.

03:33.881 --> 03:38.469
Except for the tie, the briefcase
and the fact that I can rent a car.

03:38.677 --> 03:40.471
Seriously, you're an intern?

03:40.638 --> 03:44.183
I'm heading in a new career direction
and you gotta start at the bottom.

03:44.934 --> 03:46.644
Dude.

03:47.853 --> 03:53.067
I know I'm a little older than you guys,
but it's not like I'm Bob Hope.

03:55.986 --> 03:58.113
The comedian. USO.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.617
Uh, it's U.S.A., sir.

04:09.124 --> 04:12.169
This is Joey Tribbiani.
Joey, these are the producers.

04:12.336 --> 04:15.297
And as you probably already know,
this is Leonard Hayes.

04:15.923 --> 04:17.757
Wow.

04:19.426 --> 04:23.847
It is so amazing to meet you.
I am such a big fan of your work.

04:24.014 --> 04:27.518
Well, I've been blessed with
a lot of great roles.

04:27.685 --> 04:32.856
Tell me about it, huh?
"Unlimited nights and weekends!"

04:34.024 --> 04:37.319
Are you making fun of me?
Because I am not a sellout.

04:37.528 --> 04:40.197
I didn't do it for money.
I believe in those phones!

04:40.364 --> 04:44.743
I almost lost a cousin
because of bad wireless service.

04:44.952 --> 04:49.081
No, I wasn't making fun of you. I think
you were great in those commercials.

04:49.248 --> 04:50.582
- Really?
- Yeah.

04:50.749 --> 04:53.836
Well, I do bring a certain
credibility to the role.

04:54.044 --> 04:55.462
- It's true.
- Are you kidding?

04:55.629 --> 04:57.256
When they shoot
you out of that cannon...

04:59.133 --> 05:01.302
"Hang up that phone!"

05:01.885 --> 05:03.178
- One take.
- Wow.

05:03.387 --> 05:05.055
Did that in one. I know.

05:05.222 --> 05:08.267
- So shall we read?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

05:08.434 --> 05:11.812
Top of Act 2. This is my entrance.
You got it?

05:11.979 --> 05:13.772
Mm-hm.

05:16.025 --> 05:18.652
What the hell are you still doing here?

05:19.320 --> 05:21.071
Oh. Uh.

05:21.238 --> 05:23.615
- I think you know.
- Bastard!

05:23.824 --> 05:27.328
I am what you made me.
You know what? I could go right now.

05:27.536 --> 05:30.205
- Go! Go!
- I can't.

05:30.372 --> 05:34.084
Oh, I want to, Long Pause...

05:36.253 --> 05:38.380
...but I can't.

05:39.256 --> 05:45.304
I'm so sorry. You're not supposed
to say "long pause."

05:46.930 --> 05:51.310
Oh! Oh, I thought that was your
character's name. You know?

05:51.477 --> 05:54.938
I thought you were, like, an Indian
or something, you know, with the...

05:55.105 --> 05:56.857
- Sorry.
- Long Pause.

05:57.024 --> 06:00.903
No. Thank you so much for coming in.
We appreciate it. Thank you.

06:01.070 --> 06:02.905
Sure you don't want me to do it again?

06:03.072 --> 06:04.698
- I could do it with an accent.
- No.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.033
You know, Southern.

06:06.200 --> 06:08.619
"I could go right now, mon!"

06:08.786 --> 06:09.953
Huh?

06:12.539 --> 06:14.708
My God in heaven.

06:15.250 --> 06:20.172
Joey, hang on for a second. Leonard,
can we talk to you for a moment?

06:20.339 --> 06:21.382
Yes?

06:23.092 --> 06:25.094
You've gotta be kidding.
See, he can't act.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.514
I don't care if you think he's hot.

06:28.680 --> 06:31.725
If you wanna sleep with him,
do it on your own time. This is a play.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.729
No, listen, if you insist on this...

06:35.896 --> 06:37.940
...I will call my agent so fast...

06:38.107 --> 06:42.111
...on a cell phone connection so clear,
he's gonna think I'm next door!

06:43.487 --> 06:48.534
Uh, hi. Uh, thank you so much
for whispering for my benefit.

06:48.742 --> 06:52.996
If you tell me what I did wrong, I would
love to work on it and try it again for you.

06:53.163 --> 06:55.499
And also, how you doing?

06:58.836 --> 07:02.965
Would you please just give me another
chance? I really wanna get better. Please?

07:03.132 --> 07:04.174
Really?

07:04.341 --> 07:07.094
Well, if you wanna come back today...

07:07.261 --> 07:09.179
- ...here are my notes. Ready?
- Yeah.

07:09.388 --> 07:12.141
Um, you're in your head.
You're thinking way too much.

07:12.349 --> 07:14.560
I really doubt that.

07:15.144 --> 07:19.022
No, no, no. It's that you're not connected
with anything in your body.

07:19.231 --> 07:21.483
- No urgency. The scene is a struggle.
- Uh-huh.

07:21.650 --> 07:22.734
- It's a race.
- Uh-huh.

07:22.901 --> 07:25.154
Also, what you did was horizontal.

07:25.320 --> 07:28.991
- Don't be afraid to explore the vertical.
- Uh-huh.

07:29.158 --> 07:33.704
And don't learn the words.
Let the words learn you.

07:38.625 --> 07:40.586
Couldn't I just sleep with
the producer?

07:44.715 --> 07:46.800
Hey, do you wanna go
to dinner tonight?

07:46.967 --> 07:50.554
Oh, I can't. I've got a date
with that waitress, Katie.

07:50.721 --> 07:54.141
Yeah, I know we've only gone out,
like, twice, but I don't know...

07:54.308 --> 07:58.937
- ...I have a good feeling about her.
- Oh, I hear divorce bells.

07:59.313 --> 08:01.982
Give me your wallets,
and there won't be a problem.

08:02.149 --> 08:03.942
- What?
- I have a gun.

08:04.151 --> 08:07.321
Okay, just relax, Phoebe.
Just stay calm.

08:09.281 --> 08:11.742
Oh, my God, I can't find my wallet!

08:13.702 --> 08:17.414
- All right, lady, now give me your purse.
- No.

08:17.623 --> 08:21.168
What do you mean, "no"? I knew
you'd be my death, Phoebe Buffay!

08:22.586 --> 08:25.422
- Lowell, is that you?
- Phoebe?

08:25.631 --> 08:30.302
- Oh, my God!
- Unbelievable! Oh, my God! Oh!

08:30.469 --> 08:34.932
I'm sorry. Ross, this is my old friend,
Lowell, from the streets! Ha, ha.

08:35.097 --> 08:37.518
- Lowell, Ross.
- Ross, nice to meet you.

08:37.726 --> 08:39.852
Yeah, a real pleasure.

08:40.062 --> 08:44.274
- Oh, it's been so long! Oh, so long.
- Ha-ha-ha.

08:44.483 --> 08:47.945
- I can't believe you're still doing this.
- Ah, I know. But I quit smoking.

08:48.153 --> 08:49.905
Good for you.

08:50.072 --> 08:51.782
You look like you're doing well.

08:51.990 --> 08:53.367
I guess your mugging days
are behind you.

08:53.575 --> 08:54.618
Oh.

08:54.785 --> 08:58.121
Oh, my God.
Phoebe, you used to mug people?

08:59.623 --> 09:02.543
Excuse me, Ross,
old friends catching up.

09:06.630 --> 09:07.798
_H6Y-
_H6Y-

09:07.965 --> 09:11.426
- How'd the audition go?
- They wanna see me again, but, uh...

09:11.593 --> 09:14.346
...boy, Leonard Hayes did not like me.

09:14.513 --> 09:18.183
- What happened?
- Oh, he said I wasn't urgent enough.

09:18.350 --> 09:23.689
Everything I did was horizontal,
and I should be more vertical.

09:24.439 --> 09:28.110
- Oh, and he said that I should think less.
- Well, so far so good.

09:30.195 --> 09:32.281
Honey, I'm old!

09:33.532 --> 09:34.658
What's wrong?

09:34.866 --> 09:39.997
I am so much older than these other
interns. I can't compete with them.

09:40.163 --> 09:41.707
So you're a little older.

09:41.873 --> 09:44.835
Look at the positive.
You have all this life experience.

09:45.043 --> 09:50.591
Yes, but I don't think life experience
is gonna help me with these.

09:50.841 --> 09:56.221
Wow! It's like they're on fire!

09:56.388 --> 09:58.181
Ooh.

10:01.184 --> 10:03.437
- What are they?
- Prototype sneakers.

10:03.604 --> 10:06.189
I need ideas on how to sell them.
Which I can't do...

10:06.356 --> 10:09.151
...because no self-respecting adult
would ever wear these.

10:09.318 --> 10:10.861
I'll give you $500 for them.

10:15.032 --> 10:18.076
- What am I supposed to do?
- Come on, sneakers are easy.

10:18.243 --> 10:21.955
- You wear them all the time.
- They're not called sneakers anymore.

10:22.122 --> 10:28.045
They're called "kicks" or "skids."
I think I heard somebody say "slorps."

10:29.588 --> 10:33.342
They've got wheels that pop out from
the bottom so you can roll around...

10:33.508 --> 10:36.928
...because apparently
walking is too much exercise.

10:37.095 --> 10:41.475
"Kids! Kids! Roll your way
to childhood obesity!"

10:43.310 --> 10:45.479
Would you help me try to sell these?

10:46.229 --> 10:50.734
Okay. Have you considered
using a girl with huge knockers?

10:51.526 --> 10:53.403
That's not what they're looking for.

10:53.612 --> 10:56.156
Hey, that would work on me.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.325
Why do you think I buy
Mrs. Butten/vorth's?

11:07.626 --> 11:08.794
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.338
- Hey.
- You'll never guess what just happened.

11:11.505 --> 11:14.174
- Phoebe and I got mugged!
- Are you okay?

11:14.383 --> 11:16.968
Yeah, because Phoebe knew the mugger.

11:17.844 --> 11:19.221
How do you know a mugger?

11:19.429 --> 11:23.684
I'm sorry, I have friends
outside the six of us.

11:23.850 --> 11:26.978
Know how she knew him?
Because Phoebe used to mug people.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.897
Seriously?

11:29.064 --> 11:32.609
Well, I'm not proud of it,
but, you know...

11:32.776 --> 11:37.989
...when I was living on the street and
I needed money for food and stuff...

11:38.198 --> 11:42.077
- That is awful.
- I wasn't rich like you guys, okay?

11:42.244 --> 11:45.789
I didn't eat gold
and have a flying pony.

11:46.498 --> 11:50.669
I had a hard life.
My mother was killed by a drug dealer.

11:50.877 --> 11:54.005
- Your mother killed herself.
- She was a drug dealer.

11:56.466 --> 12:01.430
It was a good thing Phoebe knew him.
I was about to do some serious damage.

12:01.638 --> 12:03.014
Okay.

12:04.683 --> 12:07.686
This must have brought back
some bad memories for you, Ross.

12:07.894 --> 12:10.689
- Why?
- Well, Ross was mugged as a kid.

12:10.897 --> 12:14.151
- You were?
- Yeah. And it was pretty traumatic.

12:14.317 --> 12:16.486
It was outside St. Mark's Comics.

12:16.653 --> 12:21.658
I was minding my business, seeing what
kind of trouble Spider-Man got into.

12:21.867 --> 12:23.910
Ahem, Wonder Woman. Ahem.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.205
Anyway, I was heading
towards this bakery...

12:27.372 --> 12:30.834
...to pick up a couple of dozen
linzer tortes for someone...

12:33.837 --> 12:37.299
...when out of nowhere, this thug
with a pipe jumps out and says:

12:37.466 --> 12:39.760
- "Give me your money, punk!"
- Oh, my God.

12:39.926 --> 12:42.804
I know. And the worst part was
they took my backpack...

12:42.971 --> 12:48.810
...which had all the original artwork I had
done for my own comic book, Science Boy.

12:49.311 --> 12:52.189
Oh, yeah! What was
his superpower again?

12:52.397 --> 12:55.275
A superhuman thirst for knowledge.

12:56.985 --> 12:59.029
I better get to class.

12:59.196 --> 13:02.407
Are there any more of your friends
I should look out for on my way?

13:02.616 --> 13:05.702
No. Actually, you might wanna
stay away from Jane Street.

13:05.869 --> 13:07.412
That's where Stabby Joe works.

13:12.542 --> 13:15.378
- Okay, I think we have a problem here.
- What?

13:15.587 --> 13:20.717
Well, um, back in my mugging days,
I, um, worked St. Mark's Comics.

13:20.884 --> 13:23.804
- Yeah?
- Well, a pipe was my weapon of choice...

13:23.970 --> 13:28.767
...and, um, preteen comic-book nerds
were my meat.

13:30.560 --> 13:31.603
So?

13:31.812 --> 13:35.273
There was one kid who had
a sticker on his backpack that said:

13:35.482 --> 13:37.692
"Geology rocks!"

13:40.821 --> 13:44.741
- Oh, my God!
- I know! I mugged Ross!

13:51.665 --> 13:53.583
- You're late.
- I know. I'm sorry.

13:53.750 --> 13:55.502
But can I just run to the bathroom?

13:55.710 --> 13:59.714
- No. Leonard doesn't wait.
- But I am bursting with Yoo-hoo!

14:01.007 --> 14:03.593
Joey, here we go!
Let's go. Very quickly.

14:03.802 --> 14:06.179
- I really need...
- We must go now, quickly.

14:06.388 --> 14:09.432
- Yeah. Yes, sir. Ahh.
- Ready?

14:10.308 --> 14:14.187
- What the hell are you still doing here?
- I think you know!

14:15.063 --> 14:18.942
- Oh, you sick bastard!
- I am what you made me! Know what?

14:19.109 --> 14:21.862
- What?
- I could go right now.

14:24.072 --> 14:29.911
- Then go. Go!
- Oh, I can't. I want to, but I can't!

14:32.581 --> 14:35.292
Cut. That was good!

14:35.458 --> 14:39.004
- Very good. You did everything I asked.
- I did?

14:39.170 --> 14:42.757
Yes. Plus which, you've got this,
I don't know, this squirmy quality...

14:43.258 --> 14:45.927
...you bring to the character
I couldn't have imagined.

14:46.136 --> 14:47.637
Wow, hey, here's what we're gonna do:

14:47.804 --> 14:50.348
Come back tomorrow
for the final callbacks.

14:50.515 --> 14:53.643
Do all of this, what you got going now.
But you know what?

14:53.810 --> 14:55.395
More. More. Can you do that?

14:55.562 --> 14:59.900
Sure. I don't have time to say
thank you because I really gotta go!

15:01.359 --> 15:05.322
Look at that! Still in character.
I like him.

15:05.488 --> 15:10.285
I plant seeds. I can't explain it.
I don't know.

15:14.497 --> 15:17.250
- Hey. What are you doing?
- Hey. Putting on the sneakers...

15:17.417 --> 15:20.211
...to get in the young mindset,
see if it sparks anything.

15:20.378 --> 15:23.089
- Oh, anything yet?
- Yes, how's this?

15:23.256 --> 15:28.261
"They're so uncomfortable, it's like
getting kicked in the nuts for your feet."

15:31.306 --> 15:33.475
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:41.942 --> 15:44.527
You're probably wondering
what I'm doing. Ha, ha.

15:44.819 --> 15:46.321
No, that seems about right.

15:47.322 --> 15:52.160
Yesterday at my audition, I had to pee.
Apparently, that makes me a good actor.

15:52.327 --> 15:54.913
I got a callback, so I'm drinking
everything. Oh, by the way...

15:55.080 --> 15:57.832
Mm-hm.
- ...that eggnog in our fridge was great!

15:57.999 --> 16:02.587
- Joey, that was formula.
- We gotta get more of that.

16:04.547 --> 16:08.885
These aren't half bad. You should
suggest these to Ralph Lauren.

16:09.094 --> 16:14.224
Okay, first of all, that's stupid.
Second, I'm not allowed to talk to Ralph.

16:14.641 --> 16:18.728
All right. I feel younger already.

16:21.398 --> 16:23.942
Yeah, I think I broke my hip.

16:26.277 --> 16:27.779
- Hey, you!
- Hey.

16:27.988 --> 16:30.532
Hey. How was class?

16:31.324 --> 16:33.451
No one ever asks me that.
What's wrong?

16:34.619 --> 16:37.664
- Nothing. I really wanna know.
- Oh, uh.

16:37.831 --> 16:42.210
Well, there was actually a rather
lively discussion about the Pleistocene...

16:42.377 --> 16:44.921
All right, nothing is worth this.

16:45.255 --> 16:48.842
Um, I have a confession to make. Um...

16:49.009 --> 16:52.012
Okay, you know that, um, girl that
mugged you when you were a kid?

16:52.554 --> 16:57.892
What are you talking about?
It wasn't a girl. It was this huge dude.

16:58.101 --> 17:01.604
You don't have to lie anymore.
I know that it was a 14-year-old girl.

17:01.813 --> 17:03.356
- No, it wasn't.
- Yes, it was.

17:03.565 --> 17:07.736
No, it wasn't. You don't think I would have
defended myself against a 14-year-old...?

17:07.944 --> 17:11.656
- "Give me your money, punk!"
- Oh, my God, it was you!

17:13.199 --> 17:17.119
I can't believe it. You mugged me?

17:17.871 --> 17:21.374
Yeah. And I'm so, so sorry, Ross.
I'm sorry.

17:21.540 --> 17:24.252
But, you know, if you think about it,
it's kind of neat.

17:26.003 --> 17:30.133
I mean, well, it's just that I've
always felt kind of like an outsider.

17:30.300 --> 17:33.845
You know, the rest of you have
these connections that go way back...

17:34.012 --> 17:38.641
...and, you know, now you and I
have a great one.

17:39.768 --> 17:41.603
It's not the best!

17:42.604 --> 17:45.899
I know. Please forgive me.
I don't know what to say.

17:46.107 --> 17:49.819
There's nothing you can say! That was
the most humiliating thing ever.

17:50.028 --> 17:53.239
- Really? Even more humiliating than...
- Let's not do this!

17:56.326 --> 18:00.080
And then, at the end of the commercial,
the girls get out of the hot tub...

18:00.246 --> 18:02.707
...and start making out
with each other. Huh? Huh? Huh?

18:04.834 --> 18:07.295
That's interesting.

18:07.837 --> 18:11.341
Just one thought:
You didn't mention the shoes.

18:13.676 --> 18:16.471
- Who's next? Chandler.
- Okay.

18:16.971 --> 18:19.474
You start on the image of
a guy putting on the shoes.

18:19.641 --> 18:21.684
- He's about my age.
- Pfft! Your age?

18:21.851 --> 18:23.561
Uh-huh.

18:24.229 --> 18:27.273
So he's rolling down the street
and he starts to lose control.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.984
Maybe he falls.
Maybe he hurts himself.

18:30.151 --> 18:33.863
Just then, a kid comes flying by
wearing the shoes.

18:34.030 --> 18:37.659
He jumps over the old guy and laughs.
And the line reads:

18:37.826 --> 18:40.537
"Not suitable for adults."

18:41.412 --> 18:45.375
- Well, Chandler, that's great.
- Oh, thank you, sir.

18:45.542 --> 18:48.545
Or, man who's two years
younger than me.

18:49.838 --> 18:54.634
You see, that has a clear selling point.
It appeals to our key demographic.

18:54.801 --> 18:57.804
- How did you come up with that?
- I don't know! I don't know!

18:57.971 --> 19:03.685
I was just trying to get into a young
mindset, and stuff started to flow.

19:05.603 --> 19:08.523
- That is great. Good work.
- Thank you.

19:08.731 --> 19:10.692
We'll see all of you tomorrow.

19:20.743 --> 19:23.621
The cold weather hurts my hip.

19:28.293 --> 19:34.757
Hey, Ross. I know you're still mad at
me, but can I just talk to you for a sec?

19:34.966 --> 19:38.469
Sure, go ahead. Oh, sorry.
Sure, go ahead.

19:39.804 --> 19:42.932
I just really wanted to apologize again.

19:43.099 --> 19:47.937
And also show you something
I think you'll find very exciting.

19:49.647 --> 19:52.275
Oh, my God! "Crap from the street!"

19:57.739 --> 20:00.325
Look, Ross. In this box...

20:00.491 --> 20:05.079
...are all the things I got from mugging
that I thought were too special to sell...

20:05.246 --> 20:06.289
...or smoke.

20:08.750 --> 20:11.753
Anyway, I was looking through it,
and I found...

20:12.420 --> 20:14.214
...Science Boy.

20:15.673 --> 20:18.760
Oh, my God!

20:20.678 --> 20:23.139
- I never thought I'd see this again.
- Yeah.

20:23.306 --> 20:24.349
What...?

20:25.683 --> 20:27.060
It's all here!

20:27.227 --> 20:28.519
- Yeah.
- Ha, ha.

20:28.978 --> 20:31.773
What made you save it
all these years?

20:31.981 --> 20:34.442
I guess I just thought
it was really good.

20:34.609 --> 20:36.986
And maybe it would be
worth something one day.

20:37.820 --> 20:41.324
You really thought Science Boy
was worth saving?

20:41.532 --> 20:46.621
Yeah. But you should know I also have
a jar of Vaseline and a cat skull in here.

20:49.332 --> 20:52.335
Still, this is amazing!

20:52.502 --> 20:54.462
Oh, my God. Thank you, Phoebe.

20:54.671 --> 20:59.092
You're welcome. And thank you for
Science Boy. I learned a lot from him.

20:59.676 --> 21:01.177
You're welcome.

21:04.013 --> 21:07.558
- I need an answer!
- I can't tell you something I don't know.

21:07.725 --> 21:09.644
- You know!
- I don't know!

21:09.852 --> 21:15.775
- I need an answer now!
- You want an answer? The answer is...

21:20.321 --> 21:22.240
Aw...

21:23.533 --> 21:26.077
She never loved me.
She only loved you.

21:26.286 --> 21:28.997
You knew this all along
and you never told me?

21:29.163 --> 21:34.252
I can never forgive you, or myself. I have
nothing to live for. Bang! And scene!

21:36.254 --> 21:38.506
Absolutely amazing.

21:40.758 --> 21:44.804
- The part is yours.
- Thanks! Now I really got to get going.

21:45.013 --> 21:48.933
Wait, wait, wait! Congratulations.
You did it.

21:49.100 --> 21:52.937
You did it. You can relax now. Yeah.

22:05.616 --> 22:07.827
Wow! That's a big cable bill.

22:08.911 --> 22:13.875
Ha. You don't have a job,
but you have no problem ordering porn.

22:14.584 --> 22:17.086
On a Saturday afternoon?

22:17.420 --> 22:19.797
I was in the house!

22:22.008 --> 22:25.303
Hey, uh, Phoebe didn't by any
chance mention that...

22:25.511 --> 22:27.972
She was the huge guy
that mugged you? Yeah.

22:29.098 --> 22:31.684
I see. You didn't happen to tell...

22:31.893 --> 22:35.521
- Everybody we know? Yeah.
- Great. Thanks.
