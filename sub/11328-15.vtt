00:02.958 --> 00:04.592
<i>Bonito, you found me.</i>

00:04.627 --> 00:07.562
Maria, I did.

00:07.596 --> 00:09.898
All right,
let's just do it. No.

00:09.932 --> 00:11.599
I'm afraid that if I do,

00:11.634 --> 00:14.069
then we'll lose all the
progress we've made so far.

00:14.103 --> 00:16.137
Anne still gone? Yep.

00:16.172 --> 00:18.106
You asked her if
the baby is yours?

00:18.140 --> 00:20.008
I don't know why she got
upset, unless it's not my
baby.

00:20.042 --> 00:22.177
Where's your mom? Where's
Robbie? They're still at
Mimsy's.

00:22.211 --> 00:23.945
I still think it's
in your best interest

00:23.979 --> 00:25.280
to make friends with Amy,

00:25.314 --> 00:26.815
and if you keep spying on her,

00:26.849 --> 00:28.650
you're not going to make
friends with Amy. I know.

00:28.684 --> 00:30.118
She's cheating on me,
isn't she?

00:30.152 --> 00:31.986
She's having sex with herself,

00:32.021 --> 00:33.354
by herself.

00:33.389 --> 00:34.422
I love you.

00:35.624 --> 00:38.026
I met someone,
someone named Jimmy.

00:38.060 --> 00:40.829
Jimmy, huh? He's Mom's high
school boyfriend's son.

00:40.863 --> 00:43.131
Dad, if you want Mom back,
you better get on the phone.

00:43.165 --> 00:44.966
She's seeing her old
high school boyfriend.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.968
I want my son,
and I'm going to court

00:47.002 --> 00:49.304
to make sure you don't just
take off with him ever again.

00:49.338 --> 00:51.306
I'm going to get some
kind of legal agreement

00:51.340 --> 00:54.075
so that John doesn't just
disappear any time you feel
like taking off.

00:54.110 --> 00:55.543
I slept with Ricky last night.

00:55.578 --> 00:56.744
<i>We had sex.</i>

01:11.293 --> 01:12.894
What happened?

01:12.928 --> 01:14.596
I don't know. Someone threw
something through the window.

01:14.630 --> 01:16.598
That's what the security
company said, anyway.

01:16.632 --> 01:19.067
It looks like it was a rock
or something. We have
security cameras.

01:19.101 --> 01:22.003
They know what was
thrown and who threw it.

01:22.037 --> 01:23.538
They got the guy? The guy?

01:23.572 --> 01:25.673
What kind of car
does Adrian drive?

01:25.708 --> 01:27.108
Oh, no. Adrian
has a bad temper,

01:27.143 --> 01:28.409
but she wouldn't do
something like this.

01:29.712 --> 01:31.045
A red convertible.

01:31.080 --> 01:32.213
It was Adrian.

01:32.248 --> 01:34.182
Adrian threw a rock
through the window?

01:34.216 --> 01:37.352
<i>A cell phone, as she shouted
"Chupacabra."</i>

01:37.386 --> 01:39.954
What? It's a devil dog.
Goat sucker.

01:39.989 --> 01:41.389
You been sucking goats?

01:41.423 --> 01:42.724
What? By sucking goats,

01:42.758 --> 01:44.959
I mean entertaining
other girls

01:44.994 --> 01:47.629
up in your apartment,
girls other than Adrian.

01:47.663 --> 01:50.532
And Adrian found out, huh?

01:50.566 --> 01:52.100
<i>Sorry, chupacabra,</i>

01:52.134 --> 01:53.968
but you have to pay
for the window.

01:54.003 --> 01:56.304
I told our security guys
not to call the cops,

01:56.338 --> 01:58.673
so that means I can't report
it to the insurance company.

01:58.707 --> 02:00.275
How much is it?

02:01.477 --> 02:03.244
Then Adrian's paying
for the window.

02:03.279 --> 02:04.679
I don't have this
kind of money.

02:04.713 --> 02:06.080
You or Adrian, I don't care.

02:06.115 --> 02:08.249
But the window's
getting replaced today

02:08.283 --> 02:09.918
before the boss man shows up.

02:09.952 --> 02:14.088
<i>So I want the money pronto,
chupacabra.</i>

02:19.195 --> 02:20.595
Adrian's number.

02:20.629 --> 02:23.131
No longer in service.

02:31.707 --> 02:32.807
Good morning.

02:32.841 --> 02:34.342
There's nothing good about it.

02:34.376 --> 02:36.678
I'm trying to call Adrian,
and her cell phone isn't
working.

02:36.712 --> 02:39.214
And I need her house number.
You have her house number?

02:39.248 --> 02:40.848
No. Why would I have
her house number?

02:40.883 --> 02:41.916
I hardly ever talk to her.

02:41.951 --> 02:43.418
Oh, please. You do, too.

02:43.452 --> 02:45.353
Not on the house phone.
Is there a problem?

02:45.387 --> 02:47.488
Forget it. I'll see you
at school, and Adrian.

02:47.523 --> 02:49.357
I'm taking the day off.

02:49.391 --> 02:50.525
Oh, because Amy's
back in town.

02:50.559 --> 02:52.327
You can't avoid her forever,
you know.

02:55.898 --> 02:57.532
Ames, he's not going
to break up with you.

02:57.566 --> 02:59.534
You know Ben. He loves you.

02:59.568 --> 03:01.869
Still, he's going
to break up with me.

03:01.904 --> 03:03.037
Does he know about
the other guy?

03:03.072 --> 03:04.806
I don't know. Does it matter?

03:04.840 --> 03:07.475
Ashley.

03:07.509 --> 03:09.110
I just want to get
this over with.

03:12.948 --> 03:14.048
Why's she in such a hurry?

03:14.083 --> 03:15.817
Ben is breaking
up with her again.

03:15.851 --> 03:18.419
And if he does,
you be there for her.

03:18.454 --> 03:20.555
Because she'll just fall apart
without Ben in her life?

03:20.589 --> 03:22.824
Yes. Maybe she wants Ben
to break up with her.

03:22.858 --> 03:24.058
Permanently.

03:24.093 --> 03:26.160
No, she doesn't.
You sure about that?

03:26.195 --> 03:28.596
She and Mom are pretty fickle.
Fickle and crazy.

03:28.631 --> 03:30.665
So you better call Mom today

03:30.699 --> 03:33.268
before she makes you break
up with her permanently.

03:37.206 --> 03:39.540
<i>* Falling in love *</i>

03:39.575 --> 03:42.710

04:03.999 --> 04:05.667
You're paying for that window.

04:05.701 --> 04:10.305
Zoe called me and told me she
had sex with you. She wanted
me to know.

04:10.339 --> 04:12.240
Why's that? Why would
she want you to know?

04:12.274 --> 04:15.276
I don't know, but I know
you did, didn't you?

04:15.311 --> 04:17.144
You slept with her boyfriend
before I slept with her.

04:17.178 --> 04:20.113
I slept with her to get back
at you for sleeping with her
boyfriend.

04:20.149 --> 04:23.151
I slept with her
boyfriend a while back,

04:23.185 --> 04:25.153
and I slept with him
to get back at you

04:25.187 --> 04:26.287
for sleeping with all
those other girls.

04:26.322 --> 04:27.822
I slept with all
those other girls

04:27.856 --> 04:30.158
to get back at you for
sleeping with all those other
guys.

04:30.192 --> 04:33.094
No, you didn't. You slept
with all those other girls
just because you could.

04:33.128 --> 04:35.263
You slept with all those
other guys just because you
could.

04:35.297 --> 04:36.798
That was before.

04:36.832 --> 04:38.099
Before, after, who cares?

04:38.133 --> 04:39.500
I care.

04:39.535 --> 04:42.170
I told you I care.

04:42.204 --> 04:44.505
I've done nothing but
try to be nice to you,

04:44.540 --> 04:46.040
and this is how you treat me?

04:46.075 --> 04:47.675
How have you tried
to be nice to me?

04:47.710 --> 04:49.010
I had sex with you.

04:49.044 --> 04:51.112
Then you're nice to everyone,
aren't you?

04:52.715 --> 04:54.182
You're paying for that window.

04:54.216 --> 04:56.517
What window? The one that you
threw your cell phone through

04:56.552 --> 04:57.552
at the butcher shop.

04:57.586 --> 04:58.853
There's no proof.

04:58.887 --> 05:00.621
Maybe I just left my
cell phone over there

05:00.656 --> 05:02.123
when I was over at your place.

05:02.157 --> 05:04.225
There are security
cameras there, Adrian.

05:04.259 --> 05:06.027
Really? Really.

05:06.061 --> 05:07.662
Did they call the police?

05:07.696 --> 05:09.797
No, they didn't, but someone
has to pay for that window,

05:09.832 --> 05:10.998
and it's not going to be me.

05:11.033 --> 05:12.133
Well, it should be you.

05:12.167 --> 05:13.801
I was aiming for your window.

05:13.836 --> 05:16.003
Well, you missed.

05:19.842 --> 05:20.975
What?

05:21.009 --> 05:22.243
Yeah.

05:22.277 --> 05:23.644
Don't they have insurance?

05:23.679 --> 05:25.813
They have insurance, but if
they want to make a claim,

05:25.848 --> 05:27.181
they'll have to make
a police report.

05:27.216 --> 05:28.816
For what? It was an accident.

05:28.851 --> 05:31.052
It was not an accident.
Yes, it was.

05:31.086 --> 05:32.820
I meant to hit your window.

05:32.855 --> 05:34.555
You know, the little
cheap one upstairs.

05:34.590 --> 05:37.158
Whether you meant to hit my
window or the window in the
butcher shop,

05:37.192 --> 05:38.826
it wasn't an accident.

05:38.861 --> 05:41.496
You threw the phone with the
intention of breaking a
window,

05:41.530 --> 05:43.998
and you broke one.
You committed a crime.

05:44.032 --> 05:45.700
I don't have any money.

05:45.734 --> 05:47.001
Then I guess you're
going to jail,

05:47.035 --> 05:48.403
because I don't have
any money, either.

05:48.437 --> 05:50.838
That's where I work, Adrian.
That's where I live.

05:50.873 --> 05:53.174
Bunny and Mr. Boykevich
have done everything for me.

05:53.208 --> 05:54.842
If not for that job
and that apartment,

05:54.877 --> 05:56.511
I'd have no chance at all

05:56.545 --> 05:57.945
trying to get
rights to see John.

05:57.980 --> 06:00.448
Oh, that was it, wasn't it?

06:00.482 --> 06:02.116
You wanted me fired and
kicked out of there.

06:02.151 --> 06:03.184
No, I didn't.

06:03.218 --> 06:04.252
I need the money right away.

06:04.286 --> 06:05.486
They're fixing
the window today.

06:05.521 --> 06:06.687
I don't have it. Get it.

06:06.722 --> 06:08.356
Ask your dad for it.

06:08.390 --> 06:11.426
I can't ask my dad for the
money to replace a window I
broke

06:11.460 --> 06:13.094
because my boyfriend
cheated on me

06:13.128 --> 06:14.829
because I didn't
want to have sex.

06:14.863 --> 06:16.697
Then I'll ask him.
No, you won't.

06:16.732 --> 06:18.900
I will. You ask him,
or I will.

06:30.145 --> 06:32.580
Hey, Ashley.
How are you? I'm okay.

06:32.614 --> 06:35.249
How are you? How's the
custody battle going?

06:35.284 --> 06:37.051
I just want some guarantee

06:37.085 --> 06:39.253
that Amy's not going to
take off with John again.

06:39.288 --> 06:41.055
There's no guarantee.
You know that.

06:41.089 --> 06:43.791
Yeah, I know, but I don't
want her to be able

06:43.826 --> 06:45.793
to just take off with
him any time she wants.

06:45.828 --> 06:46.861
She can't do that.

06:46.895 --> 06:48.129
I think she can do that.

06:48.163 --> 06:50.364
She just did do that.
Is your mom back?

06:50.399 --> 06:52.533
Still not back?

06:52.568 --> 06:56.170
He is your dad's baby, isn't
he? Robbie? I have no idea.

06:56.205 --> 06:58.272
You think he is,
or he isn't? I don't know,

06:58.307 --> 06:59.807
but I know that
John's your baby.

06:59.842 --> 07:01.108
Yours and Amy's.

07:01.143 --> 07:02.410
Yeah, well, like you said,

07:02.444 --> 07:03.578
it doesn't seem to
make any difference

07:03.612 --> 07:04.745
that he's my son, too.

07:04.780 --> 07:05.913
That's not what I said.

07:07.049 --> 07:08.516
Are you really going to court?

07:08.550 --> 07:09.917
I don't want to,
but if I don't,

07:09.952 --> 07:12.753
and then Amy moves
or takes him away,

07:12.788 --> 07:15.089
when he gets older he's
going to ask where I was

07:15.123 --> 07:16.757
and why I didn't
fight for him.

07:16.792 --> 07:18.626
So I think I have to.

07:19.928 --> 07:21.128
I don't have to?

07:21.163 --> 07:22.196
Court?

07:22.231 --> 07:24.098
You and Amy fighting
over my nephew in court?

07:24.132 --> 07:25.366
It's just so...

07:26.468 --> 07:28.102
common.

07:28.136 --> 07:29.937
I think John deserves
better than that.

07:29.972 --> 07:32.139
What else can I do?
What choice do I have?

07:32.174 --> 07:35.476
Gee, Ricky, let me see-- You
could just try talking to Amy
again.

07:35.511 --> 07:37.011
Adrian doesn't think
that will work.

07:38.480 --> 07:39.747
You think she's wrong?

07:39.781 --> 07:41.949
I think that you and Ben
better make your own decisions

07:41.984 --> 07:45.786
when it comes to Amy,
and leave Adrian out of it.

07:45.821 --> 07:47.154
That's just my opinion.

07:54.496 --> 07:57.198
Do you mind? This is a
private conversation.

07:57.232 --> 07:58.399
Oh, sorry.

08:05.774 --> 08:08.442
Maria? What kind
of a name is that?

08:08.477 --> 08:10.611
Italian.
Does she look Italian?

08:10.646 --> 08:12.513
I heard she's pretty,
if that's what you mean.

08:12.548 --> 08:14.749
No, that's not what I mean.

08:14.783 --> 08:17.518
Who told you that? Did Ben
tell you that, that she's
pretty?

08:17.553 --> 08:18.753
No. Jack told us.

08:18.787 --> 08:20.354
Well, he told me.

08:20.389 --> 08:22.189
When did you start
talking to Jack again?

08:22.224 --> 08:23.758
Oh, it just happened,

08:23.792 --> 08:26.761
when Grace wouldn't
have oral sex with him.

08:26.795 --> 08:29.664
And why would he talk
to you about that?

08:29.698 --> 08:31.532
Yeah, Madison. Why?

08:31.567 --> 08:33.801
I'm a good listener.

08:33.835 --> 08:36.437
I'm a good talker and
I'm a good listener.

08:36.471 --> 08:37.972
Why wouldn't he talk to me?

08:38.006 --> 08:39.140
What don't I know?

08:39.174 --> 08:40.775
According to Jack,
this Maria girl

08:40.808 --> 08:44.445
just came out of nowhere and
jumped Ben on the beach.

08:44.479 --> 08:46.781
And they kind of
rolled around together

08:46.815 --> 08:48.516
with her hanging on to him.

08:48.550 --> 08:51.118
Yeah, and then they
went and talked,

08:51.153 --> 08:52.853
over by themselves.

08:52.888 --> 08:55.122
I was talking about you.

08:55.157 --> 08:56.791
You and Jack?

08:56.825 --> 08:58.059
Why didn't I know about that?

08:59.194 --> 09:01.195
Never mind.
I don't want to know.

09:03.765 --> 09:05.700
I'm not even sure I
want to know about Ben.

09:05.734 --> 09:08.402
We figured that Ashley had
already told you everything
anyway.

09:08.437 --> 09:09.804
I mean, she did, right?

09:09.838 --> 09:11.005
How would Ashley know?

09:11.039 --> 09:12.206
Ashley was there.

09:12.240 --> 09:13.407
Ashley was where?

09:15.510 --> 09:20.181
Wow. She and Dad still
have their little secrets.

09:22.784 --> 09:25.586
Not that I care, because I
have a secret of my own.

09:25.621 --> 09:27.588
We heard. Jimmy?

09:27.623 --> 09:29.256
Yeah. Grocery store?

09:29.291 --> 09:31.225
And how did you
hear about that?

09:31.259 --> 09:33.394
From Griffin. From Griffin.

09:38.800 --> 09:41.068
I really thought that
Ashley would have told her.

09:41.103 --> 09:43.304
Yeah. Guess not.

09:51.446 --> 09:53.314
Hi. Hi.

09:59.621 --> 10:00.721
So you're back.

10:00.756 --> 10:02.890
I guess I am. Guess?

10:02.924 --> 10:04.492
Yeah. I guess I'm back.

10:04.526 --> 10:06.327
You're not moving or
anything like that, are you?

10:06.361 --> 10:08.829
Does it matter to you if I
move or anything like that?

10:08.864 --> 10:09.997
Ashley told you?

10:10.032 --> 10:11.065
Ashley didn't
tell me anything.

10:11.099 --> 10:13.567
Why don't you tell me, Ben?

10:13.602 --> 10:15.069
Madison or Lauren,
did they say anything?

10:15.103 --> 10:16.270
About what?

10:16.304 --> 10:18.005
Did Ricky say anything?

10:18.040 --> 10:21.776
No. Let's just get
this over with.

10:21.810 --> 10:25.112
Break up with me for
your friend from Bologna.

10:25.147 --> 10:26.881
Break up with me for
all the other reasons

10:26.915 --> 10:28.115
you should break up with me.

10:28.150 --> 10:29.517
Can we talk about this later?

10:29.551 --> 10:31.118
Let's go someplace after
school and let's talk.

10:31.153 --> 10:33.788
No, I want to talk now.

10:33.822 --> 10:36.123
And stop being so
kind and considerate

10:36.158 --> 10:38.793
because it's not helping.

10:38.827 --> 10:40.795
And just so you know,
I have a new boyfriend,

10:40.829 --> 10:42.363
and his name is Jimmy.

10:42.397 --> 10:45.800
Hm? So break up with me.

10:45.834 --> 10:47.802
Break up with me and run away

10:47.836 --> 10:52.807
with Ms. Spaghetti
Maria Bologna,

10:52.841 --> 10:54.108
because I have
someone else, too.

10:54.142 --> 10:55.609
I'll call you
when you get home.

10:55.644 --> 11:00.247
No, Ben. Come on.
We both know it's over.

11:00.282 --> 11:04.151
Break up with me.
Right now, Ben. Right now.

11:04.186 --> 11:07.421
All right, well, I guess
we both know it's over,

11:07.456 --> 11:10.791
so we'll make it official.

11:10.826 --> 11:16.297
Say it. Amy,
I'm breaking up with you.

11:26.775 --> 11:27.775
Hi, Amy.

11:30.545 --> 11:32.513
Would this be a good
time to talk to you?

11:32.547 --> 11:33.547
No.

11:45.907 --> 11:47.941
Were you in the hallway
when Ben and Amy broke up?

11:47.976 --> 11:49.543
No, I wasn't.
I'm glad I wasn't.

11:49.577 --> 11:50.877
I don't want to
see anyone hurt.

11:50.912 --> 11:51.912
You want to talk?

11:51.946 --> 11:52.913
If you want to talk.

11:52.947 --> 11:54.081
I'm going out with Madison.

11:54.115 --> 11:55.449
What?

11:55.483 --> 11:57.217
I know you're not
really cheating on me,

11:57.251 --> 11:59.219
and I don't want
to cheat on you.

11:59.253 --> 12:02.823
I want you to know I'm
going to date Madison.

12:02.857 --> 12:04.424
I really like her.
She's a nice girl.

12:04.459 --> 12:05.959
And she likes oral sex.

12:05.994 --> 12:07.394
Yeah.

12:07.428 --> 12:08.562
Okay.

12:08.596 --> 12:09.763
Okay?

12:09.797 --> 12:11.999
If that's what you want to do,
then okay.

12:12.033 --> 12:14.501
That's all you're going
to say? I like Madison.

12:14.535 --> 12:16.136
I hope you two are
very happy together.

12:16.170 --> 12:17.170
What happened?

12:17.205 --> 12:18.839
We had sex, and it was great.

12:18.873 --> 12:21.508
We tried something new,
and it wasn't so great.

12:21.542 --> 12:23.677
And now you don't care if I
go out with another girl?

12:23.711 --> 12:25.512
Grace, you just can't
hide in your room,

12:25.546 --> 12:27.080
doing what I know
you're doing, forever.

12:27.115 --> 12:29.082
Maybe I can.
Why would you want to?

12:29.117 --> 12:30.317
Why wouldn't I want to?

12:32.553 --> 12:33.787
Madison, hi.

12:33.821 --> 12:34.855
I was just talking to Jack,

12:34.889 --> 12:36.356
and he told me you
two are going out.

12:36.391 --> 12:38.425
and I just wanted to tell
you that I'm fine with that.

12:38.459 --> 12:40.494
Not that you need my
permission or anything.

12:40.528 --> 12:44.264
I just don't want to lose
you or Jack as a friend.

12:44.298 --> 12:46.533
See you.

12:46.567 --> 12:48.935
And I hope we can continue
with our dead parents' club.

12:48.970 --> 12:50.003
I really enjoy it.

12:55.143 --> 12:56.710
What was that about?

12:56.744 --> 12:58.278
I guess she's okay
with us going out.

12:58.312 --> 13:00.747
No, no, she's not.
She couldn't be.

13:00.782 --> 13:02.516
She is. Why is that?

13:02.550 --> 13:05.252
I don't know, Madison, but
I'm okay with us going out.
Are you?

13:05.286 --> 13:06.353
Sure.

13:06.387 --> 13:07.554
Then let's do it.

13:07.588 --> 13:08.555
I'll call you tonight.

13:08.589 --> 13:09.923
All right.

13:11.125 --> 13:12.893
Hey, I was looking for you.

13:12.927 --> 13:14.227
I don't have
majorette practice,

13:14.262 --> 13:15.929
so you want to go
somewhere and hang out?

13:15.963 --> 13:18.265
I can't. I have a
huge test tomorrow.

13:18.299 --> 13:19.366
You want to study at my house?

13:19.400 --> 13:20.567
It's my English lit test.

13:20.601 --> 13:22.035
It's a take-home.
I turn it in tomorrow.

13:22.070 --> 13:26.573
Just that? Well, I wanted
to ask you about something.

13:26.607 --> 13:29.976
Oh. I already know about Jack
and Madison. They're going
out.

13:30.011 --> 13:31.578
They're going out?

13:31.612 --> 13:34.247
Like, out out? Dating?

13:34.282 --> 13:36.416
Yeah. But we're all still
going to be friends.

13:36.451 --> 13:37.784
Why? Why not?

13:37.819 --> 13:38.985
He's your boyfriend.

13:39.020 --> 13:40.420
Not anymore.

13:40.455 --> 13:42.923
Yeah, well, I wish I
could be like you.

13:42.957 --> 13:44.257
I wish Ricky could
see other women

13:44.292 --> 13:46.059
and I could just accept that,
but I can't.

13:46.094 --> 13:47.227
Ricky's seeing someone?

13:47.261 --> 13:48.595
He slept with someone.

13:48.629 --> 13:49.963
You know that girl named Zoe?

13:49.997 --> 13:51.932
Sorry.

13:51.966 --> 13:53.533
Who'd you sleep with?
Her boyfriend?

13:53.568 --> 13:55.602
That was a long time ago.

13:55.636 --> 13:56.937
That was months ago.

13:56.971 --> 13:58.939
Ricky and I aren't what
we were months ago.

13:58.973 --> 14:02.209
That's why when Zoe called me
and told me she slept with
him,

14:02.243 --> 14:03.877
I got really upset,

14:03.911 --> 14:07.047
and I drove over to
the butcher shop,

14:07.081 --> 14:09.149
and I threw my phone
at his window.

14:09.183 --> 14:11.718
Only I missed,

14:11.753 --> 14:14.387
and I hit the bigger
window at the butcher shop,

14:14.422 --> 14:17.390
so now I owe...

14:18.392 --> 14:19.626
Wow.

14:19.660 --> 14:21.828
Yeah. Where am I going to
get that kind of money?

14:21.863 --> 14:23.563
I don't know.

14:23.598 --> 14:25.298
It costs this
much for a window?

14:25.333 --> 14:26.600
Yeah, and the thing is

14:26.634 --> 14:28.902
Ricky gives all his money
to Amy and that stupid baby,

14:28.936 --> 14:30.570
so I have to come
up with this today,

14:30.605 --> 14:32.773
or he's going to go to my
dad and ask him for it.

14:32.807 --> 14:34.474
Then you should go
to your father first.

14:34.509 --> 14:37.911
Yeah. Or...

14:37.945 --> 14:39.446
Maybe you could loan it to me?

14:40.648 --> 14:42.749
I mean, if you don't want to,

14:42.784 --> 14:45.252
or if it puts you in
an awkward position--

14:45.286 --> 14:47.587
I mean, if I had the
money and you came to me

14:47.622 --> 14:50.190
and asked me for the loan,
of course I would, but--

14:50.224 --> 14:53.593
I can't. I'm sorry.

14:53.628 --> 14:54.828
Good luck.

15:01.235 --> 15:02.536
Got some money for me?

15:02.570 --> 15:04.104
No, I don't.

15:04.138 --> 15:05.539
Bunny, here's the thing--

15:05.573 --> 15:07.874
Adrian doesn't have any money,

15:07.909 --> 15:09.543
and I could probably
get the money

15:09.577 --> 15:12.212
if I went to Adrian's dad
and told him what happened.

15:12.246 --> 15:14.548
But when I started
thinking about it,

15:14.582 --> 15:16.116
it's not entirely her fault.

15:16.150 --> 15:17.384
I did the wrong thing,

15:17.418 --> 15:19.052
and now I'd like to
do the right thing

15:19.086 --> 15:20.287
and pay for that window.

15:20.321 --> 15:21.888
I shouldn't have
cheated on Adrian,

15:21.923 --> 15:23.557
and I pushed her to the limit.

15:23.591 --> 15:28.228
She's been trying really hard,
and I haven't.

15:28.262 --> 15:30.130
I want to figure out
some way to pay you.

15:30.164 --> 15:31.898
<i>Look, chupacabra,</i>

15:31.933 --> 15:34.234
there's no excuse for
Adrian breaking a window,

15:34.268 --> 15:36.369
so don't try to make
excuses for her.

15:36.404 --> 15:37.904
But if you want to
pay for the window--

15:37.939 --> 15:41.241
And I don't think you're
doing her any favor by doing
that,

15:41.275 --> 15:43.743
then you go to Mr. Boykevich,
tell him what happened,

15:43.778 --> 15:45.645
and work something
out with him.

15:45.680 --> 15:48.081
And when you do,
just keep in mind

15:48.115 --> 15:49.282
that he has a right

15:49.317 --> 15:52.686
to call the police
and press charges.

15:59.427 --> 16:00.694
I tried to find
you after school.

16:00.728 --> 16:02.562
I told you I had
to be here on time.

16:02.597 --> 16:04.531
I'm sorry about that.

16:04.565 --> 16:06.199
I didn't know if I
was coming to work.

16:06.234 --> 16:07.934
I really need to go
over and talk to Amy.

16:07.969 --> 16:10.036
I thought that was over.
Maybe it is,

16:10.071 --> 16:12.205
but I don't like
the way it ended.

16:12.240 --> 16:13.707
Maybe I didn't do
the right thing.

16:13.741 --> 16:16.209
Maybe I should have broken
up with Amy before now,

16:16.244 --> 16:17.878
before Maria ever came here.

16:17.912 --> 16:20.547
Before I met Maria, even.

16:20.581 --> 16:22.549
But I don't think
that was right.

16:22.583 --> 16:24.217
I don't deserve that after
all we've been through.

16:24.252 --> 16:25.785
Why don't you just
leave it alone?

16:25.820 --> 16:27.554
Don't go talking to
Amy again right now.

16:27.588 --> 16:29.222
You'll just
humiliate yourself.

16:29.257 --> 16:32.559
You have a girlfriend. She
has a boyfriend. That's it.
It's over.

16:32.593 --> 16:34.060
Just accept it for now.

16:34.095 --> 16:36.196
I don't want it to be
over for you, believe me,

16:36.230 --> 16:38.265
but when it's over, it's over.

16:40.268 --> 16:41.735
You and Adrian,
you guys working things out?

16:41.769 --> 16:44.404
She threw her cell phone
through that window last
night,

16:44.438 --> 16:46.239
trying to break my window.

16:46.274 --> 16:48.575
And now she should pay for it,
but she can't,

16:48.609 --> 16:50.076
so I'm going to have to.

16:50.111 --> 16:52.412
So I'm going to see your
father and tell him what
happened,

16:52.446 --> 16:54.314
and ask him if I can
pay for it over time.

16:54.348 --> 16:55.815
But Adrian broke the window.

16:55.850 --> 16:58.251
It's my fault.
It's my responsibility.

16:58.286 --> 17:00.287
I just hate
disappointing your dad.

17:00.321 --> 17:03.857
Yeah. I know how that is.

17:03.891 --> 17:04.991
How much was the window?

17:22.076 --> 17:23.676
You have that
much money on you?

17:24.878 --> 17:26.212
I wasn't asking you for money.

17:26.247 --> 17:27.881
I can't take this.

17:27.915 --> 17:29.482
I want to take it,
but I can't.

17:29.517 --> 17:31.518
Go ahead. It's not a loan.
You can have it.

17:31.552 --> 17:33.186
No. I don't want your money.

17:33.220 --> 17:37.190
I mean, I want it,
but there's n.

17:37.224 --> 17:38.525
And this is about
Adrian and me.

17:38.559 --> 17:39.926
This isn't about you and me.

17:42.730 --> 17:44.531
It is about you and me.

17:44.565 --> 17:46.366
My dad wanted you and
me to work together

17:46.400 --> 17:49.202
because he wanted
us to be friends.

17:49.236 --> 17:51.171
So, from one
friend to another,

17:51.205 --> 17:53.173
take it. Otherwise,
you're going to be

17:53.207 --> 17:55.642
earning money that could have
been money John could have,

17:55.676 --> 17:59.546
and as a friend,
I want to confess something--

17:59.580 --> 18:01.815
The thing that's kept me
from breaking up with Amy,

18:01.849 --> 18:05.819
the real thing,
is even though I don't know

18:05.853 --> 18:09.489
if I love Amy or
if I love Maria,

18:09.523 --> 18:13.860
I do know that I
love your son.

18:13.894 --> 18:15.595
You love my son? Yup.

18:15.629 --> 18:17.998
It kills me to think I'm not
going to see him every day

18:18.032 --> 18:19.099
if I break up with Amy.

18:19.133 --> 18:20.934
You sure about
breaking up with Amy?

18:20.968 --> 18:24.170
I was sure, but Adrian keeps
trying to talk me out of it.

18:24.205 --> 18:26.673
You're not staying in the
relationship just for John.

18:26.707 --> 18:29.175
Well, maybe.

18:29.210 --> 18:30.844
Maybe we both need
legal agreements

18:30.878 --> 18:32.846
to be able to see John.

18:32.880 --> 18:35.181
Although I don't think I have
a chance in hell of getting
that one.

18:35.216 --> 18:38.051
Me, neither. I'm just doing
it because Adrian says to do
it.

18:38.085 --> 18:40.854
If neither of us were
listening to Adrian's advice
about things,

18:40.888 --> 18:42.622
what would we do?

18:48.229 --> 18:49.529
Who is it?

18:49.563 --> 18:51.231
It's me, Tom. It's Adrian.

18:54.235 --> 18:55.201
Hi, Adrian.

18:55.236 --> 18:56.536
Hi. Come in.

18:56.570 --> 18:59.706
Is Grace home?

18:59.740 --> 19:00.707
No.

19:00.741 --> 19:03.143
Oh.

19:03.177 --> 19:05.578
Um, maybe I'll wait.

19:05.613 --> 19:06.813
Yes, wait.

19:06.847 --> 19:09.482
You can wait as
long as you want.

19:09.517 --> 19:11.251
You want a soda or something?

19:11.285 --> 19:12.585
Yeah. Thanks.

19:12.620 --> 19:13.620
Come on.

19:16.690 --> 19:18.825
What can I get you?

19:18.859 --> 19:20.794
Your wish is my command.

19:20.828 --> 19:23.329
Anything you have
will be fine.

19:23.364 --> 19:24.831
Everything I have is yours.

19:24.865 --> 19:26.066
Anything?

19:26.100 --> 19:27.700
Anything.

19:27.735 --> 19:30.804
Actually, I came over to ask
Grace to reconsider giving me
a loan.

19:30.838 --> 19:33.039
I really need a loan.

19:33.074 --> 19:34.140
How much you need?

19:34.175 --> 19:36.009
I'll give you some money.

19:44.185 --> 19:45.552
Okay.

19:46.720 --> 19:49.689
Large bills or small bills?

19:49.723 --> 19:51.057
You have that kind of money?

19:51.092 --> 19:52.292
Yes, I do.

19:52.326 --> 19:54.427
You know I would never
take advantage of you.

19:54.462 --> 19:55.562
I know.

19:55.596 --> 19:57.664
But, if I don't get the money

19:57.698 --> 20:00.166
to pay Ricky for
something I did,

20:00.201 --> 20:01.501
then he's going
to tell my dad,

20:01.535 --> 20:04.170
and I could be in
a lot of trouble.

20:04.205 --> 20:06.940
And besides that, I don't
want my dad to know how
stupid I am.

20:06.974 --> 20:09.843
You don't have to
explain anything.

20:09.877 --> 20:12.312
You want the money,
I'll give you the money.

20:12.346 --> 20:14.848
It's just between you and me.

20:14.882 --> 20:17.083
No one else will ever know.
Really?

20:17.118 --> 20:19.519
Really. I love you.

20:19.553 --> 20:21.187
You know I love you.

20:21.222 --> 20:23.456
I've always loved you.

20:23.491 --> 20:24.858
Aw, Tom.

20:24.892 --> 20:26.359
I love you, too.

20:26.393 --> 20:29.028
And I'll pay you back. I
don't know when, but I will.

20:29.063 --> 20:31.731
That doesn't matter.
I want to give you the money.

20:40.221 --> 20:41.755
It's none of my business,
that's why.

20:41.790 --> 20:43.757
It's none of your business
if Ben's girlfriend

20:43.792 --> 20:44.925
shows up from Italy?

20:44.959 --> 20:46.427
I had to find out
from my best friends.

20:46.461 --> 20:48.095
Yes, you had to find
out from someone else,

20:48.129 --> 20:49.596
because whatever
happens to you and Ben

20:49.631 --> 20:50.764
should be between you and Ben,

20:50.799 --> 20:53.100
not you and Ben and me
or the whole school.

20:53.134 --> 20:55.769
I couldn't wait any longer. I
knew it was going to happen.

20:55.804 --> 20:57.304
I knew he was going
to break up with me.

20:57.339 --> 20:58.772
He knew he was going
to break up with me.

20:58.807 --> 21:00.708
I just wanted him to say it,
and he said it.

21:00.742 --> 21:03.544
We broke up, and it
is for real this time.

21:03.578 --> 21:05.379
And I am fine with that.

21:05.413 --> 21:06.747
Why are you fine with that?

21:06.781 --> 21:09.216
Because I have no choice
but to be fine with that.

21:09.250 --> 21:11.385
Because that is what it is.

21:11.419 --> 21:13.053
Ben Boykevich went
to Italy last summer

21:13.088 --> 21:14.221
and got himself a girlfriend.

21:14.255 --> 21:16.056
He met a girl.
Of course he met a girl.

21:16.091 --> 21:17.391
He probably met lots of girls.

21:17.425 --> 21:19.326
He didn't go to a
monastery in Italy.

21:19.361 --> 21:20.427
Well, he should have.

21:20.462 --> 21:21.428
But he didn't.

21:21.463 --> 21:22.529
He made a friend,

21:22.564 --> 21:23.731
a friend who really likes him,

21:23.765 --> 21:25.232
but she lives halfway
around the world,

21:25.266 --> 21:28.736
so it's not a geographically
appropriate relationship.

21:28.770 --> 21:31.405
Neither is your relationship
with this Jimmy guy.

21:31.439 --> 21:33.240
He may as well be halfway
around the world,

21:33.274 --> 21:35.075
so neither of you should
break up with each other

21:35.110 --> 21:36.243
just because you
met other people

21:36.277 --> 21:37.611
who don't live
anywhere near here.

21:37.645 --> 21:40.714
You're not moving for
this guy, are you?

21:40.749 --> 21:43.484
You and Mom aren't moving
because of her old boyfriend
and your new one.

21:43.518 --> 21:44.651
I doubt it.

21:44.686 --> 21:47.054
Jimmy is just a guy
that I flirted with

21:47.088 --> 21:50.557
in the market late at night.

21:50.592 --> 21:52.226
He's a good-looking guy,

21:52.260 --> 21:55.562
but I may have slightly
exaggerated our involvement.

21:55.597 --> 21:57.898
He asked me out for a pizza,
and Mom said I couldn't go,

21:57.932 --> 21:59.333
so he gave me his number.

21:59.367 --> 22:02.169
I never called him,
and that's about it.

22:03.371 --> 22:05.205
Yeah. Afraid so.

22:05.240 --> 22:08.008
So you're not even thinking
about moving or taking John
away?

22:08.042 --> 22:09.176
No.

22:09.210 --> 22:11.011
I don't want to move
because of a guy.

22:11.045 --> 22:14.348
I would never move John
just to be with a guy,

22:14.382 --> 22:16.016
and I want Mom to come home.

22:16.050 --> 22:20.020
Any word on that?

22:20.054 --> 22:21.655
I've said everything
I can say to her.

22:21.689 --> 22:23.023
I told her I'm sorry.

22:23.057 --> 22:25.025
I told her I love her.

22:25.059 --> 22:27.528
I told her how much I want
to keep this family together.

22:27.562 --> 22:30.531
I've said everything I can
think of to say to her. I
don't know what else to do.

22:30.565 --> 22:34.535
It's two hours away. Why
don't you drive and see
Robbie and talk to her?

22:34.569 --> 22:37.371
Because I don't feel like
driving two hours just to be
rejected.

22:37.405 --> 22:38.705
She has to want me.

22:38.740 --> 22:41.041
She has to want to fix this.
She has to say what I said,

22:41.075 --> 22:42.643
that she's sorry and loves me

22:42.677 --> 22:44.378
and she wants to keep
the family together.

22:44.412 --> 22:45.813
Until then, I don't know.

22:45.847 --> 22:47.815
Maybe she would say that
to you if she say you.

22:47.849 --> 22:49.950
I doubt it.

22:51.019 --> 22:53.053
I'll just take Moose
for a ride instead.

22:53.087 --> 22:55.389
I feel like getting out
of here for a while.

22:55.423 --> 22:56.423
I'll be back.

23:04.032 --> 23:05.866
You're right. He really
should go up there.

23:05.900 --> 23:07.434
Of course he's going up there.

23:07.469 --> 23:09.770
You don't think he's just
taking Moose for a ride, do
you?

23:09.804 --> 23:12.005
I kind of feel like
going for a ride myself.

23:12.040 --> 23:14.675
Would you watch John? I don't
think he'll wake up for a few
hours.

23:14.709 --> 23:15.776
Just listen out for him.

23:15.810 --> 23:18.545
I'll do that.

23:18.580 --> 23:19.680
Where you going?

23:19.714 --> 23:21.315
To break up with Ben again?

23:21.349 --> 23:22.850
Maybe.

23:22.884 --> 23:27.354
I don't know. I just don't
like the way we ended it.

23:27.388 --> 23:29.957
We should have had a
conversation in private, like
Ben wanted.

23:29.991 --> 23:32.693
Maybe you should go
talk to Ricky instead.

23:32.727 --> 23:36.163
What are you going to do
about Ricky and his demand
for a custody agreement?

23:36.197 --> 23:38.699
Obviously, he wants that
because he doesn't trust me,

23:38.733 --> 23:42.035
and if he doesn't trust me,
then I don't trust him.

23:42.070 --> 23:43.837
I'm not giving him
anything he wants,

23:43.872 --> 23:45.939
especially while
he's with Adrian.

23:45.974 --> 23:47.875
His girlfriend hates me,

23:47.909 --> 23:49.443
so he can demand all he wants,

23:49.477 --> 23:53.747
but I'm not giving
him or her anything.

23:56.084 --> 23:57.918
I have the money. Let me in.

24:04.025 --> 24:05.325
Where'd you get it?

24:05.360 --> 24:06.860
I got it. That's all
you need to know.

24:06.895 --> 24:09.296
From a guy? Like I had sex
with someone for money?

24:09.330 --> 24:10.297
Is that what you're implying?

24:10.331 --> 24:11.465
Where'd you get the money?

24:11.499 --> 24:12.666
That doesn't matter, does it?

24:12.700 --> 24:14.301
I thought you'd be
happy that I have it.

24:14.335 --> 24:15.969
I'm not. And why not?

24:16.004 --> 24:17.337
Because I've taken care of it.

24:17.372 --> 24:18.605
I got the money.

24:18.640 --> 24:20.674
Where'd you get the money?
From a friend.

24:20.708 --> 24:22.342
That's where I got it.
From a friend.

24:22.377 --> 24:23.577
Well, give it back.

24:23.611 --> 24:25.679
All right. I'll give it back.

24:25.713 --> 24:27.347
Where'd you get the money?

24:27.382 --> 24:28.515
I talked to Ben's dad.

24:28.550 --> 24:30.350
He's going to let me
pay it back over time.

24:30.385 --> 24:31.485
Where'd you get the money?

24:31.519 --> 24:33.020
I told my dad
what had happened,

24:33.054 --> 24:35.188
and I told him I was sorry,

24:35.223 --> 24:37.524
and I told him I'd
work around the house

24:37.559 --> 24:39.593
and do whatever I
could to pay him back.

24:39.627 --> 24:40.627
Are you lying?

24:41.896 --> 24:42.996
Are you?

24:54.075 --> 24:56.376
I'm sorry I cheated on you.

24:56.411 --> 24:58.045
I don't want to cheat
on you, Adrian.

24:58.079 --> 24:59.980
Good, because I can't take it

25:00.014 --> 25:02.616
if you cheat on me again.
I can't.

25:04.586 --> 25:09.323
It's just that Tammy's
very much in love with Tom.

25:09.357 --> 25:11.325
We had hoped that maybe,
in a few years,

25:11.359 --> 25:13.660
they could possibly
even get married.

25:13.695 --> 25:14.995
I mean, he proposed to her.

25:15.029 --> 25:17.030
At one time,
he wanted to marry her.

25:17.065 --> 25:20.500
I don't know what happened. I
didn't even know they broke
up.

25:20.535 --> 25:22.035
Tammy must be heartbroken.

25:22.070 --> 25:25.339
Do you think that it could
be a misunderstanding?

25:25.373 --> 25:27.374
It must just be a
misunderstanding.

25:28.977 --> 25:33.814
She thinks it's because she
wouldn't have sex with him.

25:35.650 --> 25:38.151
Oh, hi.

25:38.186 --> 25:40.320
Didn't realize you were
in here. How are you?

25:40.355 --> 25:42.522
Grace, Donnie and
Adele are here,

25:42.557 --> 25:45.158
and they said that Tom
broke up with Tammy.

25:45.193 --> 25:48.695
Do you have any idea why
he broke up with Tammy?

25:48.730 --> 25:51.365
It's not because, uh...

25:51.399 --> 25:52.933
Tammy wouldn't...

25:52.967 --> 25:56.036
Oh. I don't think it
would be because of that.

25:56.070 --> 25:57.104
They have phone sex.

25:59.507 --> 26:01.408
Oh, I thought
everybody knew that.

26:03.611 --> 26:05.278
They don't actually do
anything, though. They just
talk.

26:06.648 --> 26:09.249
What else do you know, Grace,
that we might not know?

26:09.283 --> 26:11.318
I know Tom really wants
to have sex with Tammy,

26:11.352 --> 26:12.886
but I don't think he
would pressure her

26:12.920 --> 26:14.988
to do anything she
doesn't want to do.

26:15.023 --> 26:16.957
Tom loves Tammy.
He really does.

26:16.991 --> 26:18.225
He says that he loves her,

26:18.259 --> 26:21.662
but that he loves some
girl named Adrian more,

26:21.696 --> 26:23.830
and he thinks Adrian
will have sex with him,

26:23.865 --> 26:25.999
so he broke up with Tammy.

26:26.034 --> 26:27.668
Why would he think that,
Grace?

26:27.702 --> 26:29.870
Why would he think that
Adrian would have sex with
him?

26:34.208 --> 26:36.343
No-- Tom.

26:36.377 --> 26:38.512
You have some
explaining to do.

26:38.546 --> 26:39.513
All right.

26:39.547 --> 26:43.016
Let me explain.

26:43.051 --> 26:47.020
I am going to marry Adrian.

26:47.055 --> 26:49.022
I love her,

26:49.057 --> 26:50.557
and she loves me.

26:50.591 --> 26:52.359
Adrian loves Ricky,

26:52.393 --> 26:53.727
and you love Tammy.

26:53.761 --> 26:55.495
That was before.

26:55.530 --> 26:56.530
Before what?

26:56.564 --> 26:58.031
That's for you to know,

26:58.066 --> 27:00.200
and me to find out.

27:02.870 --> 27:04.237
Did you give Adrian money?

27:04.272 --> 27:08.975
That has nothing
to do with it.

27:09.010 --> 27:14.481
Adrian needs a man.
I am her man.

27:14.515 --> 27:16.650
She came to me,

27:16.684 --> 27:22.422
and Tammy has never
come to me for anything.

27:23.691 --> 27:25.325
So sorry.

27:25.359 --> 27:27.494
I am with Adrian.

27:27.528 --> 27:28.895
The end.

27:33.367 --> 27:34.601
I am going to fix this.

27:34.635 --> 27:37.904
That is, if you want
her to fix this.

27:56.673 --> 27:58.073
I'm really happy
you didn't go home.

27:58.108 --> 28:00.342
Our fathers are getting
along very well.

28:00.377 --> 28:02.878
They are. I'm starving,
aren't you?

28:02.912 --> 28:04.413
I'm a little hungry, yes,

28:04.447 --> 28:07.082
but I forgot because I was
having such a good time.

28:07.117 --> 28:09.852
Betty is a very funny woman.
I love Betty.

28:09.886 --> 28:11.086
Yeah, me too.

28:11.121 --> 28:13.389
I've been wanting to
kiss you for hours.

28:13.423 --> 28:16.692
Me too, but I don't want to
get into any trouble with
your dad.

28:16.726 --> 28:18.427
You're not going to
get in any trouble.

28:18.461 --> 28:20.095
He knows I kiss you.
It's okay.

28:24.134 --> 28:26.568
Hello.

28:28.805 --> 28:31.240
I'm Amy. You must be Maria.

28:31.274 --> 28:32.441
Is nice to meet you, Amy.

28:32.475 --> 28:34.042
I've heard a lot about you.

28:35.478 --> 28:37.045
I wasn't expecting you.

28:37.080 --> 28:41.049
I just wanted to
apologize for today.

28:41.084 --> 28:43.385
I didn't want to leave
things like that--

28:43.420 --> 28:45.020
Not after everything
you've done for me.

28:45.054 --> 28:49.625
I just wanted to say
thank you, and good luck,

28:49.659 --> 28:53.061
and I hope we can
still be friends

28:53.096 --> 28:54.363
because I know
John will miss you.

28:54.397 --> 28:56.698
I hope you'll still
come over to see him.

28:56.733 --> 29:00.068
That's all I wanted to say.

29:00.103 --> 29:03.639
Good night. It was nice
meeting you, Maria.

29:03.673 --> 29:08.210
I look forward to meeting the
new guy in your life, too,
Amy.

29:09.712 --> 29:11.346
I'm sure Jimmy's a
really nice guy.

29:11.381 --> 29:14.383
Good night.

29:30.066 --> 29:32.067
You didn't tell me you
broke up with her.

29:32.101 --> 29:34.336
I do have to go back.
I go back tomorrow.

29:34.370 --> 29:37.773
I know, but it was time,
I guess.

29:37.807 --> 29:39.942
And you will go and visit
John, like she said?

29:39.976 --> 29:41.944
I might. I see.

29:41.978 --> 29:45.047
So she uses the baby not only
to keep Ricky around, but
you, too?

29:45.081 --> 29:46.615
Maybe I should have a baby.

29:47.750 --> 29:49.384
Maybe you should
have my babies.

29:49.419 --> 29:50.919
Oh, some day.

29:50.954 --> 29:53.856
Until then, you will be
visiting Amy and her baby.

29:53.890 --> 29:55.724
I don't know, Maria.

29:55.758 --> 29:58.060
I don't know anything.

29:58.094 --> 30:01.063
All I know is it's
really not easy

30:01.097 --> 30:05.067
having a relationship with a
woman who has a baby with
another man,

30:05.101 --> 30:07.603
and I don't think I
can do it anymore.

30:07.637 --> 30:09.404
Good. You don't need
to do it anymore.

30:09.439 --> 30:10.806
You need to move to Italy.

30:10.840 --> 30:12.474
I can't move to Italy.

30:12.509 --> 30:15.410
That is why I asked to come
out here, away from our
parents,

30:15.445 --> 30:18.747
so my father can talk to your
father and Betty about you.

30:18.781 --> 30:20.749
We want you to return
with us to Bologna,

30:20.783 --> 30:23.585
where we can get engaged
and have beautiful sex,

30:23.620 --> 30:27.523
and in a few years, get
married and own our own
sausage factory.

30:27.557 --> 30:32.427
I don't think I could
run a sausage factory,

30:32.462 --> 30:34.496
and I don'
t- I can't move to Bologna

30:34.531 --> 30:35.898
because I'm still
in high school.

30:35.932 --> 30:38.200
Then my father will not do
business with your father.

30:39.502 --> 30:42.504
<i>I'm kidding, I'm kidding,
my bonito.</i>

30:42.539 --> 30:45.607
But when you can,
you come to me in Bologna.

30:45.642 --> 30:47.543
You come and see me
as soon as you can,

30:47.577 --> 30:49.645
because I will miss you.

30:55.084 --> 30:58.887
<i>* She just wants to dance,
dance, dance, dance, dance
*</i>

30:58.922 --> 31:01.390
<i>* She don't want a man *</i>

31:01.424 --> 31:03.625
Oh, I didn't know
I had company.

31:03.660 --> 31:05.460
Your mom let me in.

31:05.495 --> 31:08.063
I tried to call you, but you
didn't pick up your phone.

31:08.097 --> 31:11.400
I brought the movie listings,
so we can plan our date.

31:11.434 --> 31:12.968
What night did you
want to go out?

31:13.002 --> 31:14.036
Any night. I don't care.

31:14.070 --> 31:15.837
But we're still going out,
right?

31:15.872 --> 31:18.740
Of course. I just
wanted to make sure.

31:18.775 --> 31:22.077
I mean, you've never really
taken me on a date before.

31:22.111 --> 31:25.414
Well, no,
but we've kind of dated.

31:25.448 --> 31:26.915
Well, not really.

31:26.950 --> 31:28.750
I mean, we've kind of had sex,

31:28.785 --> 31:30.319
but we haven't kind of dated.

31:30.353 --> 31:33.255
What's going on?
I feel as if you're dating me

31:33.289 --> 31:34.690
because Grace won't
have sex with you,

31:34.724 --> 31:37.059
and I will have sex with you.

31:37.093 --> 31:38.694
True, but I do like you.

31:38.728 --> 31:40.696
I really do, Madison.
I like you a lot.

31:40.730 --> 31:43.699
All right. I just--

31:43.733 --> 31:45.701
I don't really think
I want to go out.

31:45.735 --> 31:47.803
It makes me feel too
pressured to have sex.

31:47.837 --> 31:49.905
But we were having sex before.

31:49.939 --> 31:51.540
Yeah, but I don't
really want to have sex

31:51.574 --> 31:54.042
as much as I want
to have a boyfriend,

31:54.077 --> 31:55.711
and I don't think you're
going to be my boyfriend.

31:55.745 --> 31:57.713
If we're not having sex, no.

31:57.747 --> 31:59.948
Then I'd be having the same
problem I was having with
Grace.

32:01.351 --> 32:02.951
I thought you liked
what we were doing.

32:02.986 --> 32:04.386
Not that much.

32:04.420 --> 32:07.389
I mean, the sneaking
around added a lot to it,

32:07.423 --> 32:09.658
but we're not sneaking
around anymore.

32:09.692 --> 32:10.692
So you don't want to go out?

32:10.727 --> 32:11.860
No.

32:13.096 --> 32:15.030
All right, well, thanks for
the personal rejection.

32:15.064 --> 32:16.031
You're welcome.

32:16.065 --> 32:17.699
You want to dance?

32:17.734 --> 32:21.136
Dance dance, or is that
a code for oral sex?

32:21.170 --> 32:22.270
Dance dance.

32:22.305 --> 32:23.772
Okay, I may as well.

32:26.609 --> 32:29.411
<i>* She don't want a man *</i>

32:29.445 --> 32:30.512
<i>* She just wants to dance *</i>

32:30.546 --> 32:34.016
<i>* On the dance floor *</i>

32:34.050 --> 32:38.453
<i>*</i>

32:42.725 --> 32:45.360
Grace, what are
you doing here?

32:45.395 --> 32:46.762
Your dad let me in.

32:46.796 --> 32:48.030
I would have called,
of course,

32:48.064 --> 32:49.131
but you threw your phone

32:49.165 --> 32:50.399
through the butcher
shop window,

32:50.433 --> 32:53.035
so now you don't have it,
or it's not working,

32:53.069 --> 32:54.703
or maybe you're just not
answering your phone

32:54.737 --> 32:55.971
because you got
what you wanted

32:56.005 --> 32:57.472
so you don't need
to talk to anyone.

32:57.507 --> 32:59.374
Would you be quiet?
My dad's home.

32:59.409 --> 33:02.044
And I wasn't answering my
phone because I was with
Ricky.

33:02.078 --> 33:05.380
Oh, well, I wouldn't want to
involve your dad in your
problems.

33:05.415 --> 33:08.050
I wouldn't want to involve
any of your family members in
your problems,

33:08.084 --> 33:09.818
or my family members.

33:09.852 --> 33:10.819
Go on.

33:10.853 --> 33:12.087
Did you borrow money from Tom?

33:12.121 --> 33:17.392
No, I didn't. I didn't
borrow money from Tom.

33:17.427 --> 33:20.595
I took money from Tom.
He gave it to me.

33:20.630 --> 33:21.997
That is so low. I know.

33:22.031 --> 33:25.067
It was wrong, and that's
why I'm giving it back.

33:25.101 --> 33:26.768
Look, here.

33:26.803 --> 33:29.071
I shouldn't have taken it,

33:29.105 --> 33:30.238
but I was desperate.

33:30.273 --> 33:32.407
I came over to see you--

33:32.442 --> 33:34.676
You, my best friend--

33:34.711 --> 33:39.347
And your brother
offered to help me out.

33:39.382 --> 33:42.050
And I shouldn't have
taken advantage of him.

33:42.085 --> 33:43.351
No, you shouldn't have

33:43.386 --> 33:46.054
because now you have to
marry him. Marry him?

33:46.089 --> 33:48.490
Yeah, he thinks you're going
to marry him, so he broke up
with Tammy.

33:48.524 --> 33:50.025
I told him I love Ricky.

33:50.059 --> 33:51.760
I didn't tell him to
break up with Tammy.

33:51.794 --> 33:53.862
He did it anyway.
That was his decision

33:53.896 --> 33:56.031
because I didn't
promise him anything,

33:56.065 --> 33:57.733
and I'm giving him
back the money,

33:57.767 --> 33:59.835
so I don't owe him or
anyone else anything.

33:59.869 --> 34:01.803
No, I think you do.

34:01.838 --> 34:04.306
I think you owe
me an explanation,

34:04.340 --> 34:06.441
and I think you owe
Tom an apology.

34:06.476 --> 34:08.043
Good night.

34:08.077 --> 34:09.377
I'll call you.

34:09.411 --> 34:12.714
Well, how? How are you
going to call her?

34:12.748 --> 34:14.049
Do you have a cell phone?

34:14.083 --> 34:15.417
Yeah, I have a cell phone.

34:19.989 --> 34:22.623
It's just not working
at the moment.

34:23.760 --> 34:25.025
What happened?

34:26.763 --> 34:31.399
Um, I, um...

34:31.434 --> 34:32.734
dropped it.

34:32.768 --> 34:35.337
Where?

34:35.371 --> 34:39.007
In the butcher store.

34:39.041 --> 34:41.176
Dropped it, or threw
it through the window?

34:41.210 --> 34:42.677
Okay, I threw it
through the window,

34:42.712 --> 34:45.679
but Dad, I was just angry,
okay? I wasn't thinking.

34:45.715 --> 34:47.181
I went over there
to yell at Ricky,

34:47.216 --> 34:48.683
but he wouldn't
answer his phone,

34:48.717 --> 34:50.351
so I figured he was
probably with someone,

34:50.386 --> 34:54.156
so I made a mistake,

34:54.190 --> 34:57.526
and I shouldn't have thrown
my phone. Yeah, you did make
a mistake.

34:57.560 --> 35:00.028
I was just jealous, but he's
the one who's making me
jealous.

35:00.062 --> 35:02.030
He's sleeping
with other girls,

35:02.064 --> 35:04.499
and this time, he did it
because I wouldn't have sex
with him.

35:04.534 --> 35:05.801
Because?

35:05.835 --> 35:07.035
Because I want a commitment.

35:07.069 --> 35:08.370
I want to get serious.

35:08.404 --> 35:10.005
I want a future with Ricky.

35:10.039 --> 35:11.640
Do you? I do.

35:11.674 --> 35:14.209
You want to marry him? Yes,
I want to marry him.

35:14.243 --> 35:16.711
How are you going to do that
when you're not allowed to be
around his son?

35:16.746 --> 35:18.213
How are you going to do that

35:18.247 --> 35:19.915
when you're not on speaking
terms with his son's mother?

35:19.949 --> 35:22.384
If you really love this guy
and want a future with him,

35:22.418 --> 35:24.553
go over to Amy's and
make up with her.

35:24.587 --> 35:26.388
Not that again. Okay, why?

35:26.422 --> 35:29.157
Why would I do that?
I hate her.

35:29.192 --> 35:31.059
It doesn't matter.
If you love Ricky,

35:31.093 --> 35:32.394
you're stuck with Amy,

35:32.428 --> 35:34.329
so you have to learn
to get along with her.

35:34.363 --> 35:35.597
She has to feel comfortable

35:35.631 --> 35:37.332
with the idea of you
being around the baby.

35:37.366 --> 35:39.568
She has to accept you
into their family.

35:40.937 --> 35:43.004
Yes, Adrian. They're a family.

35:43.039 --> 35:45.807
Her and Ricky and John,
they're a family.

35:45.842 --> 35:47.542
Ew, no, they're not a family.

35:47.577 --> 35:49.845
They are, and you're not
going to be a part of it

35:49.879 --> 35:51.346
until you make her
comfortable with the idea

35:51.380 --> 35:53.648
of you and Ricky being
around John together.

35:53.683 --> 35:55.450
How did we turn Ricky cheating

35:55.484 --> 35:57.419
into my having to
be nice to Amy?

35:57.453 --> 35:58.854
Maybe Ricky keeps
cheating on you

35:58.888 --> 36:01.523
because he doesn't want to be
in a relationship with you,

36:01.557 --> 36:03.191
because being in a
relationship with you

36:03.226 --> 36:04.993
jeopardizes his
relationship with his son

36:05.027 --> 36:06.394
and with his son's mother.

36:06.429 --> 36:09.164
I think he loves you.
I really think he loves you.

36:09.198 --> 36:13.034
But I don't think he'll ever
commit and stop seeing other
girls

36:13.069 --> 36:14.769
until you make peace with Amy.

36:16.105 --> 36:17.472
Am I getting through
to you at all?

36:17.506 --> 36:19.608
All I did was break a window.

36:19.642 --> 36:21.476
Oh, yeah. That's right.
I forgot.

36:22.745 --> 36:24.779
You did break a window.

36:24.814 --> 36:26.748
What are you doing
with my keys?

36:26.782 --> 36:28.516
I'm taking them.
You're not driving.

36:28.551 --> 36:29.784
I have to go to school.

36:29.819 --> 36:33.455
Okay, so I'll drop you off,
if you go talk to Amy.

36:33.489 --> 36:35.590
Okay, so if I don't,
I don't have to go to school?

36:35.625 --> 36:37.525
Adrian. What?

36:37.560 --> 36:41.663
If you don't, you can walk
or you can take the bus.

36:41.697 --> 36:45.000
Why do I have to make
you do the right thing?

36:45.034 --> 36:47.002
Do the right thing.

36:56.328 --> 37:00.965
Well, I enjoyed the dancing
and the other stuff.

37:00.999 --> 37:01.999
Yeah. Me, too.

37:09.758 --> 37:10.958
So we still going out?

37:10.993 --> 37:12.727
Mm, I don't know.

37:12.761 --> 37:14.462
I'll have to think about it.

37:14.496 --> 37:17.365
You know, if you're just
going out with me so we can
do this--

37:17.399 --> 37:19.901
Not just this. We can go out
to dinner and the movies,

37:19.935 --> 37:21.636
and anything you want.
And this.

37:21.670 --> 37:22.704
I'll think about it.

37:22.738 --> 37:24.272
What? Come on, let's go out.

37:24.306 --> 37:25.406
Good night.

37:25.441 --> 37:27.842
Madison, come on.
Let's make some plans.

37:27.876 --> 37:30.111
We just did what we did.
We can go out.

37:30.145 --> 37:32.580
Yeah, but if I'm
going to do this,

37:32.614 --> 37:36.017
I can probably go
out with other guys,

37:36.051 --> 37:39.687
so I'm going to have
to think about it.

37:39.722 --> 37:40.955
Good night.

37:40.989 --> 37:42.957
Hey.

37:42.991 --> 37:43.991
Keep dancing.

37:55.904 --> 37:58.272
Hi, Jack. I can't talk right
now. I have a family
emergency.

37:58.307 --> 37:59.440
What's wrong? Is it Tom?

37:59.475 --> 38:01.642
Tom and Adrian. I have to go.

38:03.746 --> 38:05.079
Way to go, Tom.

38:09.084 --> 38:11.385
<i>* Dance, dance, dance *</i>

38:11.420 --> 38:13.387
<i>* She don't want a man *</i>

38:13.422 --> 38:19.160
<i>* She just wants to dance on
the dance floor *</i>

38:19.194 --> 38:21.729
Tom, you have to call Tammy.

38:21.764 --> 38:25.666
Call her? She's not going
to have phone sex now.

38:25.701 --> 38:28.302
Call her and apologize and
tell her you love her.

38:28.337 --> 38:29.570
But I don't.

38:29.605 --> 38:30.571
Tom. What?

38:30.606 --> 38:32.073
You were going to marry Tammy.

38:32.107 --> 38:34.909
You were going
to stay a virgin.

38:34.943 --> 38:36.210
I wish I had.

38:36.245 --> 38:38.679
Too late.

38:38.714 --> 38:42.884
But I still got
something with Adrian.

38:53.061 --> 38:54.695
It's great seeing Robbie.

38:54.730 --> 38:55.863
What about me?

38:55.898 --> 38:56.964
It was great seeing you, too.

38:59.401 --> 39:01.335
I'm really happy that
you drove up here.

39:01.370 --> 39:03.371
Yeah. Me, too.

39:03.405 --> 39:06.474
But I guess I
better get going.

39:08.076 --> 39:10.711
Do you want to
go back with me?

39:10.746 --> 39:12.647
I can give you a ride
back to the house.

39:12.681 --> 39:13.714
George. Anne.

39:13.749 --> 39:15.283
We haven't resolved anything.

39:15.317 --> 39:16.384
We can't resolve anything

39:16.418 --> 39:18.519
with you living in
assisted care with Mimsy.

39:18.554 --> 39:20.054
I like living in
assisted care.

39:20.088 --> 39:22.390
I'm the youngest woman here,

39:22.424 --> 39:23.891
and there's lots
of assistance.

39:23.926 --> 39:26.294
Why don't you allow me
to assist you, my lady?

39:26.328 --> 39:29.230
Do you remember we came home
from our first date when you
were pregnant with Robbie

39:29.264 --> 39:30.665
and I called you that?
My lady?

39:30.699 --> 39:32.900
Yeah, I remember.

39:32.935 --> 39:37.638
Okay, well, let's go, Moose.

39:39.741 --> 39:40.741
Thanks for coming.

39:53.956 --> 39:57.058
Hey, you got any idea if
Ricky's going home soon?

39:57.092 --> 39:58.059
No.

39:58.093 --> 39:59.660
I need to talk to Amy alone.

39:59.695 --> 40:00.862
Want me to ask Ricky to leave?

40:00.896 --> 40:02.263
No, don't do that.

40:02.297 --> 40:04.432
I'll wait.

40:04.466 --> 40:05.833
But the brownies
are getting cold.

40:07.669 --> 40:08.936
I'll take those.

40:08.971 --> 40:10.972
They're for Amy.
I'll save her a couple.

40:11.006 --> 40:12.173
Maybe she could come out here.

40:12.207 --> 40:13.941
You want me to tell her,
in front of Ricky,

40:13.976 --> 40:16.310
that you want her to come
out here? No, forget it.

40:16.345 --> 40:17.678
Why do you need
to talk to Amy?

40:17.713 --> 40:19.947
I want to tell her I'm
sorry about her and Ben,

40:19.982 --> 40:25.586
and I think that maybe
we should be friends.

40:26.788 --> 40:28.356
I want to be her friend.

40:28.390 --> 40:29.357
Oh, really?

40:29.391 --> 40:31.125
Really.

40:31.159 --> 40:34.095
I want to be Amy's friend.

40:34.129 --> 40:36.731
Wow. You really are
in love with Ricky.

40:38.100 --> 40:40.334
Yeah, I really am.

40:40.369 --> 40:41.736
You know what else I think?

40:41.770 --> 40:43.571
Maybe, for the first time,

40:43.605 --> 40:46.741
I really understand
that in a single moment,

40:46.775 --> 40:48.743
a person can make
one wrong decision

40:48.777 --> 40:51.746
and it can affect the
rest of their life.

40:51.780 --> 40:55.049
Amy and Ricky had sex,
and I broke a window.

40:55.083 --> 40:57.518
Yeah, well, I bet you
got more satisfaction

40:57.552 --> 40:59.153
out of your bad
decision than they did.

41:03.125 --> 41:06.427
Let me get that. I was going
to get that. He just got all
fussy.

41:06.461 --> 41:08.429
I got it.

41:08.463 --> 41:10.765
I'll help you.

41:10.799 --> 41:13.000
You don't need to stick around

41:13.035 --> 41:15.770
and pretend like you
want to help clean up.

41:15.804 --> 41:18.472
I know you want to talk. I
know you want some kind of
agreement,

41:18.507 --> 41:21.542
and I've been thinking about
that, about what you said.

41:21.576 --> 41:23.077
Yeah, I've been thinking
about that, too,

41:23.111 --> 41:25.079
and I'm soy.

41:25.113 --> 41:27.415
I'm sorry I even
brought it up.

41:27.449 --> 41:30.751
It's just that when you left
town without telling me,

41:30.786 --> 41:32.787
I got scared I was never
going to see John again.

41:32.821 --> 41:34.188
I get scared that
you'll take off

41:34.222 --> 41:35.756
and you'll never
see John again.

41:35.791 --> 41:37.191
You're interested
in seeing him now,

41:37.225 --> 41:39.026
but maybe some day,
you'll change your mind.

41:39.061 --> 41:42.697
Maybe you'll want
to move around

41:42.731 --> 41:44.398
and you won't be here
to take care of him.

41:44.433 --> 41:45.866
No, I'm not going to do that.

41:45.901 --> 41:48.035
What if you got the
chance to go to Alaska

41:48.070 --> 41:51.372
and make a million dollars,
driving on the ice roads,

41:51.406 --> 41:53.774
but you'd have to be
gone for six months?

41:53.809 --> 41:56.377
I don't like the cold.

41:56.411 --> 41:59.380
But what if you get a
scholarship to Julliard,

41:59.414 --> 42:01.716
and you take off for New York,
and you take John with you?

42:01.750 --> 42:05.052
If anything like
that ever happens,

42:05.087 --> 42:06.887
then we'll sit down and
we'll talk about it

42:06.922 --> 42:08.956
and figure out
what's best for John.

42:10.125 --> 42:11.559
And us.

42:11.593 --> 42:13.060
So you're acknowledging
that there is an us?

42:13.095 --> 42:17.064
Yeah. I guess it's
time we both realized

42:17.099 --> 42:19.066
that we are a family,

42:19.101 --> 42:21.002
even though you and
I are not a couple.

42:22.938 --> 42:24.739
So when you broke
up with Ben...

42:24.773 --> 42:28.576
I broke up with him,
or he broke up with me.

42:28.610 --> 42:31.712
We broke up with each other.

42:31.747 --> 42:33.080
It's been coming for a while.

42:33.115 --> 42:34.849
I still like him,

42:34.883 --> 42:38.686
and he's been in John's
life all this time.

42:38.720 --> 42:41.155
I still want him to see John
if he still wants to see John.

42:41.189 --> 42:43.024
So do I.

42:43.058 --> 42:45.793
He's my friend, Ben.
He's a good guy.

42:45.827 --> 42:49.997
Yeah. He is a good guy.
