Did you move his shit?

10:30.362 --> 10:31.427
What?

10:31.429 --> 10:33.295
Because It wasn't left
like this.

10:33.297 --> 10:35.430
It was the cops
who went through his shit,

10:35.432 --> 10:36.899

Uh, I'm sorry. About John.

10:45.175 --> 10:47.847
Don't be. He was an asshole.

10:49.013 --> 10:50.048
I liked him.

10:51.315 --> 10:52.317
Lucky you.

10:55.653 --> 10:58.154
What's with the, um,
the cameras?

10:58.156 --> 10:59.959
Don't know. He wouldn't say.

11:01.158 --> 11:02.457
Did you come for the job?

11:02.459 --> 11:03.959
What?

11:03.961 --> 11:05.129
[Dan] What your dad got for you.

11:06.931 --> 11:08.430
What are you talking about?

11:08.432 --> 11:09.933
John was under the impression

11:09.935 --> 11:11.034
you were coming
to stay with him.

Hey.

16:47.438 --> 16:49.337
I don't look like my dad.

16:49.339 --> 16:50.809
He were black.
[chuckles]

16:54.646 --> 16:55.778
Oh.
[chuckles]

16:55.780 --> 16:58.481
So, you're a photographer?

16:58.483 --> 17:00.482
[Sadie] Stroke journalist.
I've just graduated.

17:00.484 --> 17:01.717
Aye, he said.

17:01.719 --> 17:03.321
[Tony] Begged me
to give you a job.

17:03.655 --> 17:04.719
Really?

17:04.721 --> 17:06.388
Yeah.

17:06.391 --> 17:07.622
Odd that.

17:07.624 --> 17:09.523
[Tony]
He said you were coming across.

17:09.526 --> 17:12.294
And then, let slip that, uh...

17:12.296 --> 17:14.266
you hadn't spoken
since you were a kid.

17:16.867 --> 17:18.236

Are you embarrassed?

17:24.608 --> 17:25.840
[smacks lips]
Why?

17:25.843 --> 17:27.642

what you Limeys are like.

17:27.644 --> 17:29.544

17:29.546 --> 17:31.514
[inhales deeply]
So...

17:31.516 --> 17:34.382
what're your plans
for the future?

17:34.384 --> 17:37.521
Going back to the, uh,
good old US of A?

17:38.655 --> 17:39.721
I don't know.

17:39.723 --> 17:40.723
Mom hates me living here,

17:40.725 --> 17:42.691
so I guess that's good enough
reason to stay.

17:42.693 --> 17:43.694
[both chuckle]

17:44.761 --> 17:46.728
That's your dad talking.

17:46.730 --> 17:48.432
[Tony] Bollocks to the rules.

17:51.635 --> 17:53.535
Have you got your documents?

17:53.537 --> 17:55.403
ID, passport.

17:55.405 --> 17:56.707
We need it for the paperwork.

17:57.674 --> 17:58.740
Am I hired?

17:58.742 --> 18:00.409
[chuckles]
Listen.

18:00.411 --> 18:03.411
This newspaper's failing.

18:03.413 --> 18:06.716
[Tony] We've got about...
six months max.

18:06.718 --> 18:10.652
So, if you want short-term,
you're in the right place.

18:10.654 --> 18:13.656
Plus, I owe it to your dad.

18:13.658 --> 18:15.858
He were a bloody good reporter.

18:15.860 --> 18:19.564
That Padfoot shit he cooked up,
really saved our bacon.

18:21.132 --> 18:22.334
[Tony sighs]

18:24.669 --> 18:26.305
Why'd he top himself?

18:28.805 --> 18:30.406
You tell me.

18:30.408 --> 18:31.607
Oh.

18:31.609 --> 18:33.812
He looked tired
in those last few days.

18:34.879 --> 18:37.146
Probably cancer.

18:37.148 --> 18:38.747
Get yourself
to the bottom office,

18:38.749 --> 18:39.917
that's where you'll start.

18:41.919 --> 18:42.921

- [gasps]

18:59.836 --> 19:01.403
I said we'd get caught.

19:01.405 --> 19:02.470
Smartass.

19:02.472 --> 19:03.605
[clears throat]

19:03.607 --> 19:04.642
Shut the door, then!

19:07.478 --> 19:08.544
What do you want?

19:08.546 --> 19:10.481
I'm Dan's new partner.

19:10.748 --> 19:11.749
Oh.

19:12.984 --> 19:14.753
He didn't say
he'd been partnered with a girl.

19:15.853 --> 19:16.854
Faye.

19:17.721 --> 19:18.754
Sadie.

19:18.756 --> 19:20.456
You're American.

19:20.458 --> 19:21.623
How exotic.

19:21.625 --> 19:22.626
That's me.

19:24.661 --> 19:27.595
Uh, right, we should probably
get down to some work, so...

19:27.597 --> 19:28.599
[Sadie] Yeah.

19:33.603 --> 19:34.605
See you later.

19:37.941 --> 19:39.377
[door opens]

19:42.212 --> 19:43.781
- [door closes]
- Uh, you're there.

19:45.816 --> 19:47.885
So, are you, like, my boss?

19:48.719 --> 19:49.720
Yeah.

19:58.595 --> 19:59.765
So, who was the slut?

20:00.931 --> 20:01.932
My fiancée.

20:02.933 --> 20:05.002
Oh. Okay.

20:09.473 --> 20:11.475
[phone ringing]

20:15.513 --> 20:16.515
Hello?

20:18.082 --> 20:19.614
You're kidding?

20:19.616 --> 20:20.850
[Dan] No.

20:20.852 --> 20:22.487
No, he's a nutcase.

20:23.821 --> 20:25.019
[sighs]

20:25.021 --> 20:26.088
Yeah, okay...

20:26.090 --> 20:27.859
Okay, I'll take her with me.

20:29.559 --> 20:31.629
- Yeah, bye.
- [phone clanks]

20:36.667 --> 20:38.670
[calm music]

20:42.840 --> 20:43.942
[Dan] What're you doing?

20:44.808 --> 20:45.976
They're enchanting.

20:47.577 --> 20:48.779
[Dan] Full of demons.

20:49.846 --> 20:51.647
Really?

20:51.649 --> 20:52.784
So say our readers.

20:53.851 --> 20:54.920
What's left of them.

20:59.856 --> 21:01.859
[eerie music]

21:03.861 --> 21:05.794
[camera shutters click]

21:05.796 --> 21:07.498
- [Sadie] Shit.
- [Dan] What?

21:07.864 --> 21:09.598
Battery's dead.

21:09.600 --> 21:10.735
Good start.

21:11.701 --> 21:12.903
I've got more in my bag.

21:15.605 --> 21:17.776
[chomping]

21:21.812 --> 21:22.814
[clears throat]

21:25.650 --> 21:26.951
[chomping]

21:29.687 --> 21:30.889
[clears throat]

21:31.988 --> 21:33.755
No photos!

21:33.757 --> 21:36.124
So, let me guess, Craig.

21:36.126 --> 21:37.661
You've seen the Burning Girl.

21:38.563 --> 21:40.763
Haven't you?

21:40.765 --> 21:43.732
Okay, so what do you want
to tell us about?

21:43.734 --> 21:44.803
[Craig snickers]

21:46.571 --> 21:50.038
I know who's got the Demon Eye.

21:50.040 --> 21:51.642
[Dan] Don't bullshit me, Craig.

21:52.977 --> 21:54.877
[Craig] Your readers
are gonna love this.

21:54.879 --> 21:55.844
[camera beeps]

21:55.846 --> 21:57.612
[Dan] Can you tell me
about the Demon Eye?

21:57.614 --> 21:58.746
[Craig] Well, I've got
to tell you,

21:58.748 --> 22:00.015
it will blow your mind.

22:00.017 --> 22:02.884
I know more than
you could ever imagine.

22:02.886 --> 22:04.855
- [camera beeping]
- [Dan speaking indistinctly]

22:06.056 --> 22:08.793
[muffled chatter]

22:13.064 --> 22:14.132
[gasps]

22:15.600 --> 22:16.668
Sorry.
[clears throat]

22:17.934 --> 22:19.133
Say it again.

22:19.135 --> 22:20.137
[gasps]

22:21.805 --> 22:23.772
You've grown, poppet.

22:23.774 --> 22:25.674
- What did you say?
- [scoffs]

22:25.676 --> 22:29.378
Me and your dad, we go way back.

22:29.380 --> 22:31.550
We used to talk
to the shadows together.

22:32.650 --> 22:34.115
Look at you two, eh?

22:34.117 --> 22:36.685
The perfect accident.

22:36.687 --> 22:37.820
[Craig sighs]

22:37.822 --> 22:40.091
[Craig] Your dad took too much
and he paid the price.

22:41.057 --> 22:42.056
I'll be in the car.

22:42.058 --> 22:44.927
He could go to some dark places.
You remember?

22:44.929 --> 22:46.227
What're you talking about?

22:46.229 --> 22:48.098
He broke you. Didn't he?

22:50.700 --> 22:52.400
[John] Jesus Christ!

22:52.402 --> 22:53.835
[Craig] Poppet?

22:53.837 --> 22:55.704
- Go screw yourself.
- Sadie!

22:55.706 --> 22:56.738
We'll come back.

22:56.740 --> 22:57.939
Do you still cut yourself?

22:57.941 --> 22:59.408
- Fuck you!
- [Dan] Sadie!

22:59.410 --> 23:01.744
Ah. It's good to bleed.

23:01.746 --> 23:03.411
Just like Daddy.

23:03.413 --> 23:05.113
He took his own life, you dick!

23:05.115 --> 23:06.948
- Sadie!
- He was murdered.

23:06.950 --> 23:08.851
- [Dan] We're leaving.
- Murdered!

23:08.853 --> 23:10.689
Murdered! Murdered!

23:12.088 --> 23:13.090
Sadie.

23:13.790 --> 23:14.857
Sadie!

23:14.859 --> 23:15.924
Tell Tony I'm sick.

23:15.926 --> 23:17.726
Who gives a shit about Tony?

23:17.728 --> 23:19.197
Get your hands off me!

23:22.700 --> 23:23.832
[Dan] Don't let him get to you.

23:23.834 --> 23:24.999
[Sadie] Murdered?

23:25.001 --> 23:26.101
He just wants attention.

23:26.103 --> 23:27.902
[Sadie] Well, he got mine.

23:27.904 --> 23:29.871
- [pills rattle]
- What are you taking?

23:29.873 --> 23:31.774
[Sadie] I used to see shit
without these.

23:31.776 --> 23:32.874
Shit that wasn't there.

23:32.876 --> 23:34.075
Should you drink with them, too?

23:34.077 --> 23:35.744
Are you a doctor now?

23:35.746 --> 23:36.911
As well as a miserable dick.

23:36.913 --> 23:38.080
[Dan] All right, listen.

23:38.082 --> 23:40.215
First of all, I know that
you're upset about your dad.

23:40.217 --> 23:41.749
Even though you say
you don't give a shit,

23:41.751 --> 23:43.151
it's obvious that you do.

23:43.153 --> 23:44.786
Second of all,
don't you ever act

23:44.788 --> 23:46.854
like you did back there
when we were on the job.

23:46.856 --> 23:48.690
I know to you,
this is just a piss around,

23:48.692 --> 23:50.159
but it's a career for me.

23:50.161 --> 23:52.261
And third of all, the reason
I'm such a miserable dick

23:52.263 --> 23:53.765
is 'cause I miss John, too!

24:09.013 --> 24:10.048
[liquid sloshing]

24:13.984 --> 24:15.220
Did Dad have cancer?

24:16.720 --> 24:17.721
Not that I know of.

24:19.123 --> 24:20.221
Well, then, why did he do it?

24:20.223 --> 24:22.259
Look, there was no note,
no nothing.

24:23.827 --> 24:25.229
I'm not sure
we'll ever find out why.

24:26.096 --> 24:27.929
He was an asshole.

24:27.931 --> 24:30.498
And that... freak was right.

24:30.500 --> 24:33.034
He was greedy,
he did whatever he wanted.

24:33.036 --> 24:34.102
But murdered?

24:34.104 --> 24:36.271
I mean, come on, seriously?

24:36.273 --> 24:38.207
[Dan] Don't listen to Craig.

24:38.209 --> 24:39.943
He just wants
to get inside your head.

24:45.915 --> 24:47.015
I can't drink that.

24:47.017 --> 24:48.018
[glass clanks]

24:52.256 --> 24:53.291
Do you like to smoke?

24:54.991 --> 24:56.226
You mean, grass?

24:57.260 --> 24:58.262
[Dan] Yeah.

24:59.796 --> 25:00.798
I'm in.

25:02.967 --> 25:04.835
It's in my car.
Just... give me a minute.

25:09.038 --> 25:10.974
[retreating footsteps]

25:13.177 --> 25:14.245
[sighs]

25:23.286 --> 25:25.289
[foreboding music]

25:39.202 --> 25:40.302
[Dan] You ready?

25:40.304 --> 25:41.739
Um, yeah.

25:42.273 --> 25:43.274
[book thumps]

25:47.911 --> 25:49.913
[ominous music]

26:09.566 --> 26:10.865
No more.

26:10.867 --> 26:11.934
Why?

26:11.936 --> 26:14.268
Because you might as well
inject it into my ass.

26:14.270 --> 26:16.874
And what's wrong with your ass?

26:21.946 --> 26:23.381
Tell me more
about the Burning Girl.

26:26.049 --> 26:28.152
It's just... folklore.

26:29.152 --> 26:31.219
From the Moors.

26:31.221 --> 26:34.022
Well, you were buying it
with crazy Craig.

26:34.024 --> 26:35.126
It sells papers.

26:38.228 --> 26:41.330
There's folk round here
thinks it needs to be put back.

26:41.332 --> 26:43.232
Why?

26:43.234 --> 26:47.069
Are you ready for your
history class, Miss Wright?

26:47.071 --> 26:49.871
- [Sadie] Yes, Mr. Pothead.
- [Dan snickers]

26:49.873 --> 26:52.110
I'll have none of your cheek
or you'll go over my knee.

26:55.211 --> 26:57.278
- In 1851...
- Mm-hm.

26:57.280 --> 26:59.313
...a young weaver
named Sally Pearson

26:59.315 --> 27:01.385
was woken in the night
by her beloved dog.

27:03.420 --> 27:05.055
[Dan] <i>She rose from her bed.</i>

27:06.155 --> 27:08.223
<i>Grabbed her father's tools,</i>

27:08.225 --> 27:11.161
<i>and crafted a piece of tin
into the shape of an eye.</i>

27:13.663 --> 27:14.865
<i>The Demon Eye.</i>

27:15.365 --> 27:17.367
[ominous music]

27:28.144 --> 27:29.146
[clanks]

27:35.119 --> 27:36.919
The amulet.

27:36.921 --> 27:39.157
She said it was an act of God,

27:40.257 --> 27:41.459
the work of a higher power.

27:43.393 --> 27:45.997
But she also said
that it spoke to her.

27:46.997 --> 27:49.264
Saying what?

27:49.266 --> 27:51.300
[Dan] <i>That a famine
would gut the Moors</i>

27:51.302 --> 27:54.101
<i>and its people would perish,</i>

27:54.103 --> 27:56.039
<i>if they didn't turn their back
on sin.</i>

27:58.208 --> 27:59.344
[Sadie] <i>What kind of sin?</i>

28:00.376 --> 28:03.180
<i>Drinking, gambling...</i>

28:03.948 --> 28:04.949
sex.

28:06.283 --> 28:07.285
All the fun stuff.

28:09.119 --> 28:10.255
And?

28:12.189 --> 28:13.423
The people laughed in her face.

28:15.325 --> 28:17.094
And the famine took half
the town.

28:18.261 --> 28:19.897
So they made her a saint?

28:20.396 --> 28:21.398
No.

28:22.732 --> 28:24.166
They took her for a witch.

28:24.168 --> 28:27.502
[villagers shouting]

28:27.504 --> 28:29.007
[dog barks]

28:31.174 --> 28:33.574
- [flesh squelches]
- [screams]

28:33.576 --> 28:37.012
[Dan] <i>She was marched up
the Moors,</i>

28:37.014 --> 28:39.117
<i>and her eyes were plucked out
of her skull.</i>

28:40.417 --> 28:43.185
<i>After that,
they burnt her alive.</i>

28:43.187 --> 28:44.986
[flames crackling]

28:44.988 --> 28:46.457
<i>With her dog chained
to her side.</i>

28:48.191 --> 28:49.323
[Sadie] Padfoot?

28:49.325 --> 28:51.258
Padfoot.

28:51.260 --> 28:53.328
[Dan]
And after the ashes settled,

28:53.330 --> 28:55.429
all that was left
was the amulet.

28:55.431 --> 28:58.166
The Demon Eye.
[scoffs]

28:58.168 --> 28:59.704
A warning from the creator.

29:01.537 --> 29:05.075
It was left in the earth for...
nearly 200 years.

29:05.776 --> 29:07.074
Until?

29:07.076 --> 29:08.078
Someone found it.

29:09.212 --> 29:11.246
Or so they say.

29:11.248 --> 29:13.047
That's why they think
business is bad

29:13.049 --> 29:15.182
and the town is failing.

29:15.184 --> 29:17.386
It's nothing to do
with the Lehman Brothers.

29:17.388 --> 29:18.523
So why hold onto it?

29:23.494 --> 29:25.326
The Demon Eye

29:25.328 --> 29:27.130
will give you
whatever you desire.

29:29.065 --> 29:31.199
But the price is pain.

29:31.434 --> 29:32.534
Pain?

29:32.536 --> 29:35.405
Delivered by two deadly demons.

29:36.806 --> 29:38.142
Padfoot...

29:38.808 --> 29:40.143
And the Burning Girl.

29:41.344 --> 29:42.377
[scoffs]
Shit.

29:42.379 --> 29:44.282
- Right.
- [both chuckle]

29:45.348 --> 29:46.383
John put that together.

29:47.151 --> 29:48.151
Readers love it.

29:50.219 --> 29:53.024
But there's got to be replicas
or some shit.

29:53.289 --> 29:55.056
No.

29:55.058 --> 29:56.123
Not in this town.

29:56.125 --> 29:57.127
No one would dare.

30:01.265 --> 30:04.369
What would you wish for
if you had the eye?

30:06.069 --> 30:07.104
You don't want to know.

30:11.307 --> 30:13.310
[foreboding music]

30:33.430 --> 30:35.432
[foreboding music continues]

30:39.870 --> 30:41.169
[Sadie] What?

30:41.171 --> 30:42.539
This isn't good.

30:43.373 --> 30:44.374
What?

30:45.508 --> 30:47.109
See you tomorrow.

30:47.111 --> 30:48.146
No, wait.

30:56.120 --> 30:58.322
You stupid fat bitch!

31:00.490 --> 31:02.325
Why did you make me, Dad?

31:03.861 --> 31:05.630
[whimpers]

32:26.209 --> 32:27.342
[Sadie] I'm never...

32:27.344 --> 32:29.479
I'm never... never good enough.

32:30.747 --> 32:32.150
[groans]

- About time.
- [Faye] Where've you been?

33:50.459 --> 33:51.692
[Dan] It's over an hour.

33:51.694 --> 33:53.328
[Sadie] No signal.

33:53.330 --> 33:55.362
[Faye] Oh, my god.
Have you been sick?

33:55.364 --> 33:57.799
- Jesus.
- You're worse than your dad.

33:57.801 --> 33:59.333
Why would you say that?

33:59.335 --> 34:01.372
Look, can we just fake this,
please?

34:01.904 --> 34:03.373
Faye, stand there.

34:05.776 --> 34:07.809
Are you okay?

34:07.811 --> 34:10.779
Get over yourself, asshole,
I was just drunk.

34:10.781 --> 34:12.681
Like this?

34:12.683 --> 34:14.516
[Dan] Look, have a think, Faye.

34:14.518 --> 34:16.784
Okay, the story is,
you were out here hiking,

34:16.786 --> 34:18.085
and then, out of nowhere,

34:18.087 --> 34:20.455
you see the ghost
of the Burning Girl.

34:20.456 --> 34:23.491
This is where Sally
was set on fire?

34:23.493 --> 34:26.360
We don't know,
but we need a story, so...

34:26.362 --> 34:27.665
welcome to fake news.

34:28.799 --> 34:30.699
Not yet. A bit more this way.

34:30.701 --> 34:31.699
Right, that's fine.

34:31.701 --> 34:34.272
And point into whatever
you were doing. Yeah.

34:35.404 --> 34:36.473
[Dan] Mm-hm, okay.

34:37.341 --> 34:38.540
[thuds]

34:38.542 --> 34:39.543
Are you kidding me?

34:40.777 --> 34:42.344
Screw you!

34:42.346 --> 34:43.681
I don't think you're cut out
for this.

[scissors clank]

35:28.892 --> 35:30.928
[Faye] Go home if you want,
you're not needed.

35:34.797 --> 35:35.866
[sighs]

35:39.402 --> 35:40.437
[Faye] Hello?

35:43.873 --> 35:45.576
I'm not going anywhere.

[sighs]

35:54.518 --> 35:56.417
[mouse clicking]

35:56.419 --> 35:57.454
[Dan] Is that from today?

35:57.788 --> 35:58.789
No.

36:03.727 --> 36:04.761
Shit.

36:10.933 --> 36:11.968
Oh, my god!

36:14.203 --> 36:16.504
Right. What've we got?

36:16.506 --> 36:18.873
Nothing, except for fat selfies.

36:18.875 --> 36:20.643
- Fuck off, Faye.
- [chuckles]

36:24.747 --> 36:25.781
What happened?

36:25.783 --> 36:27.915
The weather turned.
We couldn't get the shot.

36:27.917 --> 36:29.616
Bollocks!

36:29.618 --> 36:31.421
Well, we're gonna need
something.

36:32.922 --> 36:35.757
Both of you,
get home and make something up.

36:35.759 --> 36:36.861
They want Padfoot.

36:37.694 --> 36:38.863
I'll sign it off.

36:47.471 --> 36:49.603
You should go back
to America, you know.

36:49.605 --> 36:50.871
[Sadie] What?

36:50.873 --> 36:52.806
You're a bit too big for here.

36:52.808 --> 36:53.877
Fuck you, Faye.

37:04.053 --> 37:05.853
I'm sorry about this.

37:05.855 --> 37:06.957
I know we had plans.

37:08.757 --> 37:09.960
She's got her eye on you.

37:13.529 --> 37:14.661
Don't be stupid.

37:14.663 --> 37:15.665
She has.

37:26.710 --> 37:27.711
What're you doing?

37:29.578 --> 37:30.847
Showing her who's boss.

37:36.285 --> 37:38.488
[somber music]

[snickers]

38:02.111 --> 38:04.247
[foreboding music]

38:05.881 --> 38:08.551
[Dan] Just ignore her,
she just wants attention.

38:19.629 --> 38:20.895
I'll just be
a couple of minutes.

38:20.897 --> 38:22.629
Okay.

38:22.631 --> 38:24.332
[Dan] You all right?

38:24.334 --> 38:26.036
Yeah, I'm just tired,
that's all.

38:36.645 --> 38:38.515
[sharp exhale]

38:49.158 --> 38:50.527
Do you want to come in?

38:50.893 --> 38:51.895
Yeah.

38:57.866 --> 38:58.935
Hi, Mom.

39:00.069 --> 39:01.169
This is Sadie.

39:01.171 --> 39:02.540
I know.

39:04.174 --> 39:05.940
[Dan's mother] I knew your dad.

39:05.942 --> 39:06.977
Long time ago.

39:08.678 --> 39:10.111
I've just come
to grab my laptop.

39:10.113 --> 39:11.649
You're not with Faye tonight?

39:12.147 --> 39:13.815
No.

39:13.817 --> 39:15.085
I'm working with Sadie tonight.

39:18.955 --> 39:20.654
[Dan] I won't be long.

39:20.656 --> 39:21.758
Yeah.
[chuckles]

39:29.198 --> 39:30.633
Excuse me.

39:39.908 --> 39:41.911

- [dog barks]
- [glass shatters]

39:48.718 --> 39:49.719
Shit!

39:53.790 --> 39:56.123
[Dan's mother] I'm sorry.
It was a long time ago.

39:56.125 --> 39:57.928
I don't want an apology
from you.

40:01.230 --> 40:03.600

40:17.013 --> 40:19.016
[foreboding music]

40:25.821 --> 40:28.288
[Dan's mother] I'm sorry.
It was a long time ago.

40:28.290 --> 40:30.123
[Dan] I don't want
an apology from you.

40:30.125 --> 40:31.759
[Dan's mother]
What do you want, then?

40:31.761 --> 40:33.694
[Dan] I want you to keep out
of my business.

40:33.696 --> 40:35.263
I'm just trying to help her,
make her feel better.

40:35.265 --> 40:36.763
[Dan's mother] She's bad news.

40:36.765 --> 40:38.766
You keep away from her.

40:38.768 --> 40:39.866
[Dan] Stop telling me
what to do.

40:39.868 --> 40:42.203
[Dan's mother] She's trouble,
the same as he was.

40:42.205 --> 40:44.071
Just keep away from her!

40:44.073 --> 40:45.108
Let's go.

40:49.011 --> 40:50.147
Do you have a dog?

40:51.781 --> 40:54.183
[Dan] No. I hate them.

40:55.819 --> 40:56.820
Why?

40:58.221 --> 40:59.657
No reason.

41:08.732 --> 41:10.734
[somber music]

41:21.910 --> 41:24.080
Your mom seemed pretty upset.

41:24.980 --> 41:26.114
Yeah.

41:26.116 --> 41:27.117
She's always like that.

41:27.984 --> 41:29.085
Has to get her own way.

41:30.853 --> 41:32.089
Were you talking about me?

41:34.357 --> 41:35.726
Yeah.

41:37.093 --> 41:38.759
And?

41:38.761 --> 41:39.962
Do we have to do this now?

41:41.196 --> 41:42.198
I guess not.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.235
She hates me doing this job.

41:46.870 --> 41:48.902
Thinks I could do better.

41:48.904 --> 41:49.906
What's that got to do with me?

41:53.977 --> 41:55.112
Do you mind if I stay the night?

41:56.178 --> 41:58.314
[chuckles]
Sure.

42:00.283 --> 42:02.250
Uh, Tony wants an article
on Padfoot,

42:02.252 --> 42:04.221
so we'll just have to make
something up.

42:07.357 --> 42:09.190
Do you mind
if I get a quick bath

42:09.192 --> 42:11.094
before we get down to it?

42:11.960 --> 42:13.261
[Dan] Sure.

42:13.263 --> 42:15.096
Uh, where's John's files?

42:15.098 --> 42:16.397
They'll give us a head start.

42:16.399 --> 42:18.866
[chuckles]
They're in the kitchen.

42:18.868 --> 42:20.268
Um, his papers
are a bit spread out.

42:20.270 --> 42:22.038
I'm a messy worker.

44:18.221 --> 44:20.023
<i>Well, it's cost me a bob or two.</i>

44:21.223 --> 44:22.392
<i>But they won't miss a trick.</i>

44:23.526 --> 44:26.027
<i>Gonna be my eyes and ears.</i>

50:20.716 --> 50:22.583
Oh, nothing.
I just, I just thought...

[Dan] Do you want me
to stay in here?

50:25.388 --> 50:27.054
- [chuckles]
- [Dan] Because I can.

50:27.056 --> 50:28.692
If that's what you want?

50:31.560 --> 50:32.562
Okay.

About the pills...

50:49.511 --> 50:50.777
It's none of my business.

What?

50:52.381 --> 50:53.482
I mean, it's private.

50:54.616 --> 50:56.549
You're so English. Christ.

I've been in therapy

is really no big deal.

51:01.089 --> 51:02.292
Sorry.

51:10.098 --> 51:13.600
I've had psychotic episodes,
in the past.

51:13.602 --> 51:15.772
Right before I turned... 16.

51:17.406 --> 51:19.806
The quack said it was down
to acute anxiety.

51:19.808 --> 51:23.810
Mom thinks it's the trauma
I suffered here as a kid, and...

51:23.812 --> 51:25.812
I put it down to the shit load
of LSD I took

51:25.814 --> 51:27.283
to get through school.

51:28.417 --> 51:29.685
Why was school so bad?

51:34.556 --> 51:35.558
I...

51:36.692 --> 51:37.761
I was fat.

51:39.562 --> 51:42.632
Like, uh, really fat.

51:43.732 --> 51:45.301
Never fit in.

51:45.801 --> 51:47.370
Never had a boyfriend.

51:47.870 --> 51:49.339
Always a loner.

51:49.839 --> 51:50.840
Really?

51:53.808 --> 51:57.578
But, um, whatever triggered
the visions,

51:57.580 --> 51:59.716
I've not suffered since. So...

52:00.716 --> 52:01.750
Until tonight.

52:03.718 --> 52:04.720
Yeah.

52:06.989 --> 52:08.855
What happened...

52:08.857 --> 52:09.859
when you lived here?

52:11.926 --> 52:13.426
Did John...

52:13.428 --> 52:15.495
No, no. Nothing like that.

52:15.497 --> 52:17.464
He was the best dad ever.
[chuckles]

52:17.466 --> 52:19.900
We used to, um,
play with these...

52:19.902 --> 52:21.467
my little dolls, you know,

52:21.469 --> 52:23.737
make houses for them,
take them for a walk,

52:23.739 --> 52:24.941
have tea parties together.

52:25.741 --> 52:26.743
He loved it.

52:27.777 --> 52:28.812
So what happened?

52:37.185 --> 52:38.587
Daddy?

52:42.757 --> 52:45.395
[blood trickling]

52:48.864 --> 52:51.431
You don't have to tell me.

52:51.433 --> 52:54.000
My mom couldn't live
with him, so...

52:54.002 --> 52:56.605
she moved back to the States
and took me with her.

53:00.910 --> 53:02.542
How did...

53:02.544 --> 53:03.613
How did you meet him?

53:05.214 --> 53:06.950
Me? Meet John?

53:07.982 --> 53:10.419
- Yeah.
- Uh...

53:11.687 --> 53:13.487
That's a bit
of an odd one, really.

53:13.489 --> 53:15.888
I was all set
to go off to Oxford.

53:15.890 --> 53:18.594
I'd just got a place to study
English Literature then.

53:20.029 --> 53:24.531
Then I saw an ad in the paper
for a reporter.

53:24.533 --> 53:26.833
You turned down Oxford
to work at <i>The Echo?</i>

53:26.835 --> 53:28.738
Yeah. That's what my mom said.

53:30.573 --> 53:32.007
She's still pissed off
with me, and...

53:33.808 --> 53:35.611
Truth is, I don't know
why I did it.

53:37.680 --> 53:39.549
But, John interviewed me and...

53:41.549 --> 53:42.551
I just knew.

53:43.919 --> 53:44.921
What?

53:47.790 --> 53:48.892
That was my future.

53:52.594 --> 53:53.893
[snickers]

53:53.895 --> 53:55.031
Sounds stupid.

53:57.832 --> 53:58.934
No, it doesn't.

54:15.283 --> 54:17.486
[foreboding music]

54:26.728 --> 54:27.797
Sorry.

54:29.998 --> 54:31.801
[sighs]
This feels...

54:35.036 --> 54:36.605
I need to take it slow.

54:38.306 --> 54:39.509
Can we do that?

54:40.542 --> 54:43.046
Just... one step at a time.

54:45.114 --> 54:46.483
Okay.
[chuckles]

55:07.035 --> 55:09.872
- [beast panting]
- [chains rattling]

55:12.908 --> 55:15.678
[beast panting]

55:23.152 --> 55:25.088
[snarling]

55:33.661 --> 55:36.832
[panting]

55:40.669 --> 55:42.571
[growling]

55:44.006 --> 55:45.607
[Dan] I want to be with you.

56:12.734 --> 56:14.102
[moans]

56:38.259 --> 56:40.060
[both scream]

56:40.062 --> 56:41.797
[gasps]

56:44.667 --> 56:45.868
[groans]

56:54.810 --> 56:56.779
[phone ringing]

56:58.747 --> 56:59.779
Hello?

56:59.781 --> 57:01.080
[Sadie's mom] <i>Hey, hon, it's me.</i>

57:01.082 --> 57:02.248
Mom. What?

57:02.250 --> 57:04.150
[Sadie's mom]
<i>Are you still in bed?</i>

57:04.152 --> 57:06.154
<i>It's got to be, like,
11:30 over there.</i>

57:07.955 --> 57:09.121
[sighs]
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

57:09.123 --> 57:10.759
<i>Are you taking your meds?</i>

57:11.026 --> 57:11.924
What?

57:11.926 --> 57:13.759
[Sadie's mom]
<i>Are you harming again?</i>

57:13.761 --> 57:15.027
Don't start that shit.

57:15.029 --> 57:16.163
[Sadie's mom]
<i>I'm worried about you.</i>

57:16.165 --> 57:17.864
I know.

57:17.866 --> 57:19.669
[Sadie's mom] <i>Is the house
on the market yet?</i>

57:20.736 --> 57:21.734
No.

57:21.736 --> 57:24.036
I'm gonna stay over here
for a couple of weeks.

57:24.038 --> 57:26.172
- Maybe months.
- [Sadie's mom] <i>What?</i>

57:26.174 --> 57:29.009
- <i>Why?</i>
- <i>There's opportunity over here.</i>

57:29.011 --> 57:30.243
[Sadie's mom] <i>For what?</i>

57:30.245 --> 57:31.344
<i>Oh, my god.</i>

57:31.346 --> 57:33.946
<i>Do not get dragged
into your father's world, Sadie.</i>

57:33.948 --> 57:35.817
- <i>He was a very dark man...</i>
- [phone thumps]

57:37.152 --> 57:38.187
[sighs]

57:56.337 --> 57:58.073
[sharp exhale]

58:04.846 --> 58:06.848
[ominous music]

58:18.359 --> 58:20.162
Have you heard
of the Burning Girl?

58:21.363 --> 58:22.962
Who hasn't?

58:22.964 --> 58:24.066
Where's she buried?

58:24.933 --> 58:25.868
Out there, somewhere.

58:27.770 --> 58:29.803
[driver] There's only one person
who knows that.

58:29.805 --> 58:30.837
Yeah?

58:30.839 --> 58:32.873
Craig Cooper.

58:32.875 --> 58:34.940
Folk reckon he dug up
the Demon Eye.

58:34.942 --> 58:35.944
Well, what do you think?

58:37.279 --> 58:38.915
I think he should be locked up.

58:39.814 --> 58:41.249
Bloody devil worshipper.

58:42.850 --> 58:45.120
Into the occult and black magic.

58:46.154 --> 58:47.890
Sick in the head if you ask me.

58:49.158 --> 58:51.160
[car engine revving]

58:55.196 --> 58:56.862
- [Tony] Get out!
- I'm sorry.

58:56.864 --> 58:57.931
- [Tony] You're fired.
- [Sadie] I overslept.

58:57.933 --> 58:59.966
Where's my front page?

58:59.968 --> 59:01.033
- I, I'm...
- [Tony] Look.

59:01.035 --> 59:03.804
I don't mind you staying up
all night drinking,

59:03.806 --> 59:04.904
it's part of the job.

59:04.906 --> 59:08.007
God knows, your father
was always doused in drink,

59:08.009 --> 59:10.877
but he always came in
and he never missed a deadline.

59:10.879 --> 59:13.078
- Ever!
- We have something.

59:13.080 --> 59:14.380
A lead on the Demon Eye.

59:14.382 --> 59:15.817
Aye, Dan said.

59:16.350 --> 59:17.417
He did?

59:17.419 --> 59:20.987
Look, I don't know
what's going on between you two,

59:20.989 --> 59:22.388
but Faye's having
a bloody breakdown,

59:22.390 --> 59:24.324
so nobody's making my coffee!

59:24.326 --> 59:26.859
Now, I am telling you,
as your boss,

59:26.861 --> 59:29.962
you keep your hands off his cock
or you find a new job.

59:29.964 --> 59:31.864
[Tony] Now I've got to go
and see the chief exec,

59:31.866 --> 59:34.935
and tell him why my staff
are a useless pile of dog shit!

59:34.937 --> 59:37.170
- [Sadie mumbles]
- Eight 'o' clock tonight.

59:37.172 --> 59:38.138
I want a good headline.

59:38.140 --> 59:40.977
Or the both of you,
you're yesterday's news.

59:41.910 --> 59:43.176
[Sadie] Wait!

59:43.178 --> 59:45.145
- Where's Dan?
- [Tony] Down the Red Lion.

59:45.147 --> 59:47.283
- Meeting Craig.
- [door buzzes]

59:53.888 --> 59:55.024
What're you doing here?

59:56.190 --> 59:57.359
My job.

59:59.160 --> 01:00:00.395
We made a mistake last night.

01:00:02.330 --> 01:00:03.932
Are you playing me?

01:00:04.899 --> 01:00:07.033
No, we made a mistake with work.

01:00:07.035 --> 01:00:08.268
I never miss a deadline.

01:00:08.270 --> 01:00:09.872
Why didn't we get something
to Tony?

01:00:10.872 --> 01:00:11.937
Well, let's put that right.

01:00:11.939 --> 01:00:13.275
What's this about?

01:00:14.408 --> 01:00:16.342
Crazy Craig.

01:00:16.344 --> 01:00:17.643
I think he has the Demon Eye.

01:00:17.645 --> 01:00:18.848
That's a big story.

01:00:19.881 --> 01:00:20.950
Are you sure?

01:00:22.651 --> 01:00:24.317
I don't know, but...

01:00:24.319 --> 01:00:26.185
if I can get him to open up.

01:00:26.187 --> 01:00:28.356
And if he really has it,
put it on display...

01:00:29.357 --> 01:00:30.826
it might go national.

01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:33.196
Why Craig? Why now?

01:00:35.330 --> 01:00:37.397
I saw something, last night.

01:00:37.399 --> 01:00:38.968
A video, in the basement.

01:00:39.935 --> 01:00:41.967
John had the amulet.

01:00:41.969 --> 01:00:43.169
And it wasn't found
by the police,

01:00:43.171 --> 01:00:44.373
and it wasn't found
in his belongings.

01:00:46.375 --> 01:00:47.877
I think Craig took it from him.

01:00:49.044 --> 01:00:49.946
You were in the basement?

01:00:53.314 --> 01:00:55.116
Did you see the cameras
filming the house?

01:00:56.151 --> 01:00:57.152
Yeah.

01:00:58.085 --> 01:00:59.221
Did you see me in the bath?

01:01:01.924 --> 01:01:03.223
Yeah.

01:01:03.225 --> 01:01:04.227
Did you like it?

01:01:07.261 --> 01:01:08.263
Yeah.

01:01:13.134 --> 01:01:14.870
Come on. Let's go.

01:01:17.339 --> 01:01:20.040
- Ah.
- [Dan] Sorry about that.

01:01:20.042 --> 01:01:21.708
Sadie's joining us.

01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:24.143
- If you don't mind?
- Not at all.

01:01:24.145 --> 01:01:26.011
Have you calmed down, poppet?

01:01:26.013 --> 01:01:28.013
Why did you say
my dad was murdered?

01:01:28.015 --> 01:01:30.485
- 'Cause he was.
- Let's not go there again.

01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:35.154
[Dan] Craig.

01:01:35.156 --> 01:01:36.388
You were telling me
about the Demon Eye.

01:01:36.390 --> 01:01:37.390
Uh...
[clears throat]

01:01:37.392 --> 01:01:38.458
Yeah.

01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:39.896
Get us another drink, eh, Dan?

01:01:40.361 --> 01:01:41.428
What?

01:01:41.430 --> 01:01:42.462
Another drink.

01:01:42.464 --> 01:01:44.096
Or shall I get going?

01:01:44.098 --> 01:01:45.500
[munching]

01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:53.440
How do you know he was murdered?

01:01:53.442 --> 01:01:54.911
Because I killed him.

01:01:56.178 --> 01:01:57.913
[Craig] I gave him
the Demon Eye.

01:01:58.245 --> 01:01:59.247
Look.

01:02:02.017 --> 01:02:03.386
Has it got inside you
already yet?

01:02:04.453 --> 01:02:05.988
'Cause it got inside mine.

01:02:06.455 --> 01:02:07.554
Made me...

01:02:07.556 --> 01:02:09.121
- drive my eye out.
- [gasps]

01:02:09.123 --> 01:02:10.225
[chuckles]

01:02:12.326 --> 01:02:15.330
Sleep, awake,
it's all the same to me.

01:02:17.064 --> 01:02:18.330
What did you ask for?

01:02:18.332 --> 01:02:20.132
I... I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:02:20.134 --> 01:02:21.433
Yes, you do.

01:02:21.435 --> 01:02:23.171
You've got the eye
around your neck.

01:02:24.339 --> 01:02:28.177
Look, I can make
the Burning Girl stop.

01:02:29.210 --> 01:02:31.411
I don't want to live anymore.

01:02:31.413 --> 01:02:34.450
So why don't you give me
the eye back?

01:02:36.018 --> 01:02:37.116
Dan?

01:02:37.118 --> 01:02:38.283
What? Are you all right, poppet?

01:02:38.285 --> 01:02:39.351
[Sadie] Stay away from me.

01:02:39.353 --> 01:02:40.386
Dan?

01:02:40.388 --> 01:02:41.453
She'll take away your eyes.

01:02:41.455 --> 01:02:43.091
Fuck off. Dan!!

01:02:46.428 --> 01:02:48.064
[whimpering]

01:02:51.232 --> 01:02:53.401
[man screaming]

[automated voice] <i>Doors open.</i>

[tense music]

01:03:28.536 --> 01:03:31.170
- [gasps]
- Did you sleep with him?

01:03:31.172 --> 01:03:32.237
What're you talking about?

01:03:32.239 --> 01:03:34.274
Dan! Did you shag him?

01:03:34.276 --> 01:03:35.377
- No.
- Liar!

01:03:36.310 --> 01:03:37.544
He said you shared a bed.

01:03:37.546 --> 01:03:39.547
Yeah, but...
but nothing happened.

01:03:42.551 --> 01:03:44.386
You fat slag.

01:03:46.488 --> 01:03:47.589
I'm pregnant.

01:03:50.558 --> 01:03:52.225
Does he know that?

01:03:52.227 --> 01:03:53.228
He does now.

01:03:54.462 --> 01:03:56.529
[sniffles]

01:03:56.531 --> 01:03:58.234
[sharp inhale]
You've had your fun.

01:03:59.433 --> 01:04:00.636
Now you'll never see him again.

01:04:01.703 --> 01:04:03.139
I've had you fired.

01:04:05.172 --> 01:04:06.705
[Faye] And do us a favor.

01:04:06.707 --> 01:04:08.607
Go home and find a rope.

01:04:08.609 --> 01:04:10.178
Your dad's waiting for you.

01:04:16.618 --> 01:04:17.620
[door closes]

01:04:23.225 --> 01:04:24.460
We'll see about that.

01:04:28.596 --> 01:04:30.065
[Faye] Excuse me.

01:04:30.631 --> 01:04:31.633
Keys.

01:04:34.402 --> 01:04:36.469
[keys jangling]

01:04:36.471 --> 01:04:38.107

01:04:38.473 --> 01:04:39.542

01:07:32.647 --> 01:07:33.649
What happened?

01:07:34.482 --> 01:07:36.382
What are you doing here?

01:07:36.384 --> 01:07:37.753
The backdoor key's
under the mat.

01:07:39.421 --> 01:07:40.522
I can't take this.

01:07:41.522 --> 01:07:43.388
I've got to get out of here.

01:07:43.390 --> 01:07:44.392
What?

01:07:45.593 --> 01:07:46.558
What about me?

01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:48.796
- You have your baby!
- No, I don't want it.

01:07:51.665 --> 01:07:52.801
I told her to get rid of it.

01:07:55.069 --> 01:07:56.803
[Dan] I want to be with you.

01:07:56.805 --> 01:07:58.473
Well, what about Faye?

01:08:02.410 --> 01:08:03.475
Where are you going?

01:08:03.477 --> 01:08:04.810
Home.

01:08:04.812 --> 01:08:06.281
I'll come with you.

01:08:07.716 --> 01:08:09.348
Just don't reject me.

01:08:09.350 --> 01:08:10.352
Never.

01:08:11.719 --> 01:08:12.721
You're a part of me.

to Sally's grave, then...</i>

01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:15.550

in peace.</i>

01:09:16.617 --> 01:09:17.984

[Craig] Wakey-wakey!

01:09:59.626 --> 01:10:01.526
- Help!
- [Craig snickers]

01:10:01.528 --> 01:10:03.831

[Sadie] Daddy?

01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:33.462
Jesus Christ.

01:10:35.095 --> 01:10:36.963
[Sadie] It was you.

01:10:36.965 --> 01:10:39.699
With my dad,
all those years ago.

01:10:39.701 --> 01:10:41.933
We were looking for answers.

01:10:41.935 --> 01:10:44.570
[Craig]
And the Eye gifted me that.

01:10:44.572 --> 01:10:47.539
But I didn't quite like
what I saw.

01:10:47.541 --> 01:10:50.042
Let her go, or I'll kill you.

01:10:50.044 --> 01:10:54.579
[Craig laughs]
Hey! We're dead anyway!

01:10:54.581 --> 01:10:55.950
The Burning Girl
will see to that.

01:10:57.684 --> 01:10:59.852
[Craig] It's ironic, isn't it?

01:10:59.854 --> 01:11:02.558
John always wanted to see
his children together.

01:11:03.992 --> 01:11:05.461
And here you are.

01:11:05.859 --> 01:11:06.993
In the flesh.

01:11:06.995 --> 01:11:08.026
Leave her alone!

01:11:08.028 --> 01:11:09.464
What're you talking about?

01:11:09.930 --> 01:11:10.998
Oh.

01:11:12.867 --> 01:11:14.036
Haven't you told her?

01:11:16.304 --> 01:11:17.506
Dan here...

01:11:19.006 --> 01:11:20.475
is your brother.

01:11:21.075 --> 01:11:22.478
You're sick.

01:11:24.979 --> 01:11:27.045
[Craig] Tell her.

01:11:27.047 --> 01:11:30.549
- I said, tell her!
- It doesn't matter!

01:11:30.551 --> 01:11:31.752
[Dan] We didn't know each other.

01:11:33.688 --> 01:11:34.753
I love you.

01:11:34.755 --> 01:11:35.756
[Sadie] No.

01:11:36.757 --> 01:11:38.894
No, no, no!

01:11:39.894 --> 01:11:41.761
Why?

01:11:41.763 --> 01:11:42.930
Did you know from the beginning?

01:11:45.099 --> 01:11:46.502
[Craig] Of course, he knew.

01:11:48.769 --> 01:11:49.871
But you wanted him.

01:11:52.907 --> 01:11:57.546
You wanted his touch,
so the Eye granted it to you.

01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:00.114
So, where is it?

01:12:01.916 --> 01:12:03.649
[Craig] Where is the Demon Eye?

01:12:03.651 --> 01:12:04.650
She doesn't have it!

01:12:04.652 --> 01:12:05.718
I left it at work!

01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:06.889
- Liar!
- [Sadie] I swear!

01:12:09.791 --> 01:12:11.656
[Craig] I know it's hard
to give up.

01:12:11.658 --> 01:12:12.991
I gave it to your dad.

01:12:12.993 --> 01:12:14.897
And he promised
to give it back to me.

01:12:15.763 --> 01:12:16.765
But you know what?

01:12:18.099 --> 01:12:20.002
[Craig] The Burning Girl
will show me the way.

01:12:20.969 --> 01:12:22.604
She likes the smell of blood.

01:12:25.974 --> 01:12:27.009
It's upstairs.

01:12:27.908 --> 01:12:28.911
Under my bed.

01:12:35.617 --> 01:12:36.852
Don't shovel me shit!

Hurry up!

01:13:04.711 --> 01:13:06.614
- [Dan] It's cutting my wrists.
- Deal with it!

01:13:08.215 --> 01:13:09.682
You have the Demon Eye?

01:13:09.684 --> 01:13:10.686
Just cut it!

01:13:12.153 --> 01:13:13.789
- [Sadie] It's too late.
- [static]

01:13:15.657 --> 01:13:16.658
Untie me.

Come on.

No! You're my brother!

01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:36.075
[Dan] We didn't know each other.

01:13:36.077 --> 01:13:38.013
- It's still sick!
- [Dan] I want to be with you.

01:13:40.447 --> 01:13:41.746
[Sadie sobs]

01:13:41.748 --> 01:13:42.850
We'll go to hell for this.

- [Craig screams in distance]
- [gasps]

01:13:49.189 --> 01:13:51.660

01:14:07.841 --> 01:14:09.040
[Dan] Leave it.

01:14:09.042 --> 01:14:11.009
I have to put it back
or she'll kill me.

01:14:11.011 --> 01:14:12.777
[Dan] Put it back where?

01:14:12.779 --> 01:14:13.782
[in soft voice]
[Sadie] Come on.

01:14:16.317 --> 01:14:17.853

01:14:30.898 --> 01:14:31.833
Where's this?

01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:35.267
[Dan] Uh, that's where we took
the photograph.

01:14:35.269 --> 01:14:36.802
So she should be buried

01:14:36.804 --> 01:14:39.804
about 30 or 40 feet west
of there.

01:14:39.806 --> 01:14:41.005
Let's go.

01:14:41.007 --> 01:14:43.245
[demonic voice] She's gonna
wrench his eyes out, poppet!

[sobs]

01:14:47.047 --> 01:14:48.847
She's gonna kill you, too.

You have to get out of here.

01:14:49.951 --> 01:14:51.217

- [Sadie] Put it back.

01:14:51.219 --> 01:14:53.518
- [Dan] I'm not leaving you!
- [Sadie] Get out.

01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:55.087
- You have to put it back.
- No!

01:14:55.089 --> 01:14:57.255
Go! Get out!

01:14:57.257 --> 01:14:59.027
[John] Sadie? Is that you?

01:15:00.094 --> 01:15:01.293
Dad?

so much, poppet.

Daddy?

[Sadie's mom] Are you gonna
get out of bed?

01:16:04.826 --> 01:16:06.592
Get out of bed, Sadie!

01:16:06.594 --> 01:16:09.163
[Sadie] I can't, Mom.
I'm too sick.

What're you doing in here?

01:16:44.232 --> 01:16:45.332
Dan?

01:16:47.134 --> 01:16:48.403
[Dan] You killed Faye.

01:16:49.170 --> 01:16:50.936
What?

01:16:50.938 --> 01:16:52.174
[Dan] You wanted her dead.

No. There's no way out.

01:17:07.087 --> 01:17:08.956
She gave us what we wanted,

01:17:10.123 --> 01:17:13.327
and now, we have to pay
for our sins.

01:17:15.028 --> 01:17:17.963

- I don't know.
- No, no, no.

It feels and sounds like
a paper.

01:21:52.639 --> 01:21:55.240

You're gonna need funds
if you want your sight back.

01:22:21.367 --> 01:22:23.368
The thing is, Tony...

01:22:23.370 --> 01:22:25.771

I can manage.
