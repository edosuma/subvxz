REPORTER: (ON RADIO)
<i>Hello, citizens of Gotham.</i>

00:18.895 --> 00:21.439
<i>This is Desmond Dumas with breaking news.</i>

00:21.773 --> 00:24.901
<i>Representatives from Gotham PD and City Hall</i>

00:25.068 --> 00:27.445
<i>are converging on the State Penitentiary.</i>

00:27.612 --> 00:32.116
<i>There in a top secret prison laboratory,</i>
<i>a revolutionary experiment</i>

00:32.283 --> 00:33.826
will be conducted.

00:33.993 --> 00:37.956
The proceedings will begin as soon as
Gotham's leading crime crushers,

00:38.122 --> 00:41.209
<i>Batman and Robin, the Boy Wonder, arrive.</i>

00:41.376 --> 00:45.630
<i>Delayed no doubt protecting</i>
<i>the streets of our lovely city.</i>

00:45.964 --> 00:51.094
It's been a while since our last date,
Batman. I thought you'd forsaken me.

00:51.386 --> 00:54.722
Crime fighting leaves little time
for affairs of the heart, Catwoman.

00:55.223 --> 00:57.267
But you're never far from my thoughts.

00:57.809 --> 01:00.770
Those are the nicest words
I've heard in a long time.

01:01.312 --> 01:03.856
Speaking of words, I brought my handy copy of

01:04.022 --> 01:06.985
the complete Elizabeth Barrett Browning.

01:07.151 --> 01:10.863
After all, poetry opens both
the mind and the heart.

01:11.489 --> 01:15.535
I'm more interested in you
opening these bars.

01:16.494 --> 01:21.332
And open, they will.
After only 37 more reformative months,

01:21.666 --> 01:25.837
you'll have paid your debt to society
and be a free woman once again.

01:32.677 --> 01:36.681
Holy Romeo and Juliet!
How much longer is he going to be?

01:37.682 --> 01:41.811
Do you know the perfect way
to cap this wonderful night?

01:42.270 --> 01:43.980
Tell me, Catwoman.

02:15.887 --> 02:17.680
You already know District Attorney...

02:18.014 --> 02:20.600
Harvey Dent. A pleasure to share a room

02:20.767 --> 02:23.102
with Gotham's greatest defender of justice.

02:23.394 --> 02:26.064
Your perfect record for convictions
precedes you.

02:26.230 --> 02:29.525
Couldn't do it if you didn't catch them
first, Batman. We make a pretty good team,

02:29.692 --> 02:30.985
if I do say so myself.

02:31.653 --> 02:32.987
Like Batman and Robin.

02:33.780 --> 02:35.657
Isn't it past your bedtime?

02:37.659 --> 02:41.829
And this is the inventor whose machine
we will be testing. Hugo Strange.

02:42.121 --> 02:46.918
At your service. An honor to meet
the fabled Batman in the flesh.

02:47.210 --> 02:49.087
You see, in a criminal,

02:49.253 --> 02:53.591
the psyche's battle
between good and evil is often one-sided

02:53.758 --> 02:57.720
but what if there was a way
to remove the evil?

02:59.597 --> 03:01.307
No more criminal.

03:03.059 --> 03:05.978
Intriguing. However, there are no easy fixes

03:06.145 --> 03:08.231
on the road to the straight and narrow.

03:08.439 --> 03:12.276
Gosh, yes. But a machine that extracts
the evil out of super criminals

03:12.443 --> 03:14.112
would make our jobs a lot easier.

03:14.278 --> 03:20.243
Correction. The Evil Extractor
will make your jobs obsolete.

03:21.452 --> 03:24.956
Let's not be hasty, Strange. You've got to
prove this contraption works, first.

03:25.164 --> 03:28.459
If it does, Batman and Robin
won't be the only ones out of a job.

03:28.835 --> 03:30.795

03:34.632 --> 03:38.052

A memento from the Cohen counterfeit case.

03:38.302 --> 03:40.680

16:54.681 --> 16:59.061
the Dynamic Dunderheads
will be preserved for all eternity.

Fitting, no?

17:01.438 --> 17:03.774
You... You fractured pharaoh.

17:04.900 --> 17:06.234
Hit it, boys!

17:12.115 --> 17:18.247
Batman and Robin trapped in yon urns,
awaiting their fates as the cement churns.

17:18.829 --> 17:22.792
Their clipped wings can't fly.
So, alas, they'll die.

17:23.335 --> 17:29.341
And all the crooks of Gotham shall say,
"That Tut was one heck of a guy."

17:29.633 --> 17:31.593
(LAUGHING)

17:37.182 --> 17:38.934
It's already hardening, Batman.

17:39.309 --> 17:41.311
Follow my instructions precisely.

17:41.562 --> 17:45.148
Press the back of your soles
against the side of the jar.

17:45.691 --> 17:50.279
The heat from the chemical reaction of
the cement might trigger the Bat-jets.

18:22.978 --> 18:26.189
Huh. Oh. Where am I? Batman.

18:26.565 --> 18:28.692
But if you're here that means...

18:29.484 --> 18:31.903
Oh. Tut again?

18:32.404 --> 18:34.364
I'm afraid so, Professor.

18:34.615 --> 18:40.162
(SIGHS) Having a split personality
can be so inconvenient at times.

18:50.047 --> 18:53.133
The boss's scheme is falling into place.

18:53.550 --> 18:56.094
Two-fold. Too bad about the professor.

18:56.595 --> 18:59.931
Eh, just grab the bag,
and let's get out of here. On the double.

19:06.730 --> 19:10.025
<i>The stolen loot was missing</i>
<i>from the crime scene, Caped Crusaders.</i>

19:10.192 --> 19:12.611
<i>And no sign of the biplane either.</i>

19:14.196 --> 19:15.989
Holy Amelia Earhart!

19:16.490 --> 19:18.575
Where do you hide a biplane?

19:18.742 --> 19:20.285
Tell us what you know, Professor.

19:20.619 --> 19:23.789
PROFESSOR McELROY: <i>Oh, I wish I knew,
gentlemen. Honestly, I do.</i>

19:24.706 --> 19:26.833
You expect us to believe that malarkey?

19:27.000 --> 19:31.838
Remember, Chief, King Tut committed
the crime. Not this poor pathetic soul.

19:33.298 --> 19:36.426
When he's knocked on the head,
he forgets everything he did as Tut.

19:36.843 --> 19:40.681
I think I get your meaning,
Boy Wonder. (CHUCKLES)

19:41.723 --> 19:45.769
Ow. How dare you assault my royal presence?

19:46.269 --> 19:48.438
Where'd you hide the goods,
you felonious pharaoh?

19:48.647 --> 19:50.107
Fie on thee!

19:50.273 --> 19:54.820
My secrets are as impenetrable
as any vault in the Great Pyramids.

19:55.112 --> 19:56.905
Ah! Ah-ha!

19:57.197 --> 19:58.198
Ow!

19:58.490 --> 19:59.616
What's happening?

19:59.783 --> 20:02.452
Even the pyramids were
eventually pried open, Tut!

20:02.619 --> 20:03.620
Ow!

20:03.870 --> 20:07.457
You'll have to chase me through
the 12 gates of the afterlife,

20:07.624 --> 20:10.627
and you still won't get me to talk, flatfoot!

20:11.420 --> 20:12.421
Ow!

20:12.713 --> 20:16.258
Oh, my head. Why does it hurt so bad?

20:16.883 --> 20:18.051
I won't give up that easy!

20:18.218 --> 20:19.302
That's enough, Chief.

20:19.678 --> 20:24.641
Our only recourse is to wait for
the professor to see his day in court.

20:24.850 --> 20:27.811
And if I have any say,
he'll leave a free man.

20:28.437 --> 20:30.480
Lucilee Diamond, public defender.

20:31.565 --> 20:35.819
Now, if you'll kindly leave,
so I can advise my client.

20:36.403 --> 20:37.487
Of course, Ms. Diamond.

20:39.072 --> 20:41.366
Well, Harvey, do you have a case?

20:41.950 --> 20:45.162
Looks like it, Commissioner.
Despite my winning streak since returning

20:45.328 --> 20:48.331
to the DA's office, half of me
hoped the poor devil would confess

20:48.665 --> 20:51.501
and save the expense of a lengthy trial.

20:52.002 --> 20:56.715
I have faith that a jury of his peers
will have pity on a sick man, Mr. Dent.

20:57.340 --> 20:58.592
Good day, gentlemen.

21:04.097 --> 21:07.184
Chief, have you ever
known this poor professor

21:07.350 --> 21:10.312
to break the law when he was not King Tut?

21:11.563 --> 21:14.483
Ms. Diamond, I'm not sure.
You'd have to ask Batman.

21:16.485 --> 21:19.654
So when not suffering
the effects of a concussive state

21:19.905 --> 21:22.365
that brings on the King Tut identity,

21:22.866 --> 21:26.161
he is a mild-mannered,
harmless member of society?

21:27.662 --> 21:28.872
You'd have to ask Batman.

21:29.247 --> 21:32.292
I object. Counsel is confusing the witness.

21:32.501 --> 21:33.919
Not hard to do.

21:36.046 --> 21:37.047
Overruled.

21:37.339 --> 21:40.717
And did you not try to extract a confession

21:40.884 --> 21:44.554
by bludgeoning this poor man
to recreate that concussive state?

21:44.888 --> 21:48.683
Objection. Tut is on trial here,
not the professor.

21:48.975 --> 21:52.062
It's true. All true, I confess.

22:09.704 --> 22:11.039
Batman.

22:14.584 --> 22:16.920
HARVEY:
Batman, in all your dealings with King Tut,

22:17.337 --> 22:20.215
how would he rate as criminal masterminds go?

22:20.757 --> 22:23.927
King Tut's one of my most deadly adversaries.

22:24.261 --> 22:26.721
But I believe with proper rehabilitation,

22:26.888 --> 22:30.100
Tut can someday be
a productive member of society.

22:30.851 --> 22:34.312
So you are saying the only hope to ridding
Gotham of the scourge of King Tut

22:34.479 --> 22:38.567
is to send him to prison where he can
get the help he so desperately needs?

22:39.192 --> 22:41.194
- Well, I...
- No further questions.

22:41.361 --> 22:45.615
Your Honor, I'd like to call
Professor McElroy to the stand.

22:46.199 --> 22:47.409
(GASPS)

22:48.243 --> 22:52.205
Professor, you stated for the court that
you have no memory of your actions

22:52.372 --> 22:54.457
when King Tut takes over.

22:54.624 --> 22:58.879
None whatsoever. No one is more
horrified by King Tut's actions than I.

22:59.671 --> 23:03.300
But isn't it true that
without your expertise in Egyptology,

23:03.466 --> 23:05.218
Tut couldn't commit his crimes?

23:05.594 --> 23:07.345
Well, I suppose that's true, but...

23:07.512 --> 23:11.474
Thereby making you the real
mastermind behind his schemes.

23:12.017 --> 23:13.351
Homina homina homina.

23:14.311 --> 23:16.396
No further questions, Your Honor.

23:22.527 --> 23:25.614
Fifteen years with possible

23:25.780 --> 23:27.616
Tough break for the professor.

23:27.782 --> 23:31.328
Yes, poor devil. Still, justice was served.

23:31.620 --> 23:34.664
At this rate, you'll be lead DA again
in no time, Harvey.

23:34.998 --> 23:38.627
Batman nabs the super crooks,
and I send them to the state pen.

23:38.919 --> 23:40.921
The same place Batman sent you.

23:41.212 --> 23:44.758
Why, Dick, I hope you don't feel like
a third wheel when I'm around.

23:44.925 --> 23:47.385
After all, I'm only Bruce's best friend.

23:47.552 --> 23:49.763
You're his ward.

23:51.222 --> 23:53.600
But the truth is,
if it wasn't for Batman's help

23:53.767 --> 23:59.230
or Bruce's friendship during my dark time,
who knows where I'd be right now?

24:00.023 --> 24:01.066
Robbing a bank?

24:02.108 --> 24:08.198
Oh, my! Two handsome bachelors who are
still best friends after all these years?

24:08.740 --> 24:12.494
Oh! It's enough to give a girl the vapors.

24:12.661 --> 24:15.997
Anyway, it's time I confessed to
the other reason for my visit.

24:16.164 --> 24:17.207
Go on.

24:17.374 --> 24:20.251
There is a charity that's dear to my heart,

24:20.543 --> 24:24.047
the Society for Underprivileged
Fraternal Twins.

24:24.214 --> 24:25.465
A worthy cause.

24:25.632 --> 24:28.134
The stigma of being the less-attractive twin

24:28.301 --> 24:30.845
is a heavy burden no one should have to bear.

24:31.346 --> 24:32.472
Of course I'll do it.

24:33.056 --> 24:38.478
Marvelous. I've already found the venue.
The newly refurbished Winning Pair Casino.

24:38.687 --> 24:39.896
It'll be great fun.

24:41.314 --> 24:43.149
It's the Bat-phone, sir.

24:43.316 --> 24:48.279
If you'll excuse us, Harv. Dick and I
are due at our weekly badminton lesson.

24:49.155 --> 24:51.574
Holy... Gosh, yes, you're right.

24:52.075 --> 24:53.910
Of course, Bruce. I'll be in touch.

24:56.121 --> 24:58.581
Pigs in a blanket, Mr. Dent?

25:00.125 --> 25:01.251
Yes, Commissioner?

25:01.418 --> 25:06.256
Batman, an odd package has arrived
at my office, explicitly addressed to you.

25:06.423 --> 25:08.466
Curious. We'll be right there.

25:08.633 --> 25:09.843
To the Batcave!

25:12.762 --> 25:15.598
- It's a book.
- A world atlas to be precise.

Correction, Chief, worms.

Holy plagiarism!

25:24.691 --> 25:27.777
It can only be from
that master of a thousand stolen plots.

25:27.944 --> 25:30.071
- The Bookworm.
- Indeed.

25:30.280 --> 25:33.783
Come, Robin, we have some reading
to catch up on.

25:41.082 --> 25:43.418
Why would Bookworm give us a world atlas?

25:43.626 --> 25:45.128
Despite its poor condition,

25:45.336 --> 25:49.132
I was able to
detect several pages were missing.

25:49.382 --> 25:52.135
Pages of different world capitals.

25:52.469 --> 25:54.137
I'm still stumped, Batman.

25:54.429 --> 25:57.098
Think. Longitudes and latitudes.

25:59.309 --> 26:01.978
ROBIN: <i>Holy overdue book! Of course!</i>

26:03.980 --> 26:05.815
He's using longitudes and latitudes

to correspond to
the library's classification method.

26:11.071 --> 26:12.280
Now you've got it, old chum.

26:12.530 --> 26:16.326
Based on my encyclopedic knowledge

26:16.618 --> 26:19.412

Good thing Batman was able to
piece together your little clue.

Otherwise you might have gotten away with it.

28:51.439 --> 28:53.316
"Clue?" What clue?

28:55.109 --> 28:58.196
Batman, look! The rare books, they're gone.

29:09.165 --> 29:12.418
Bookworm knew nothing about the clue
that was sent to Commissioner Gordon.

29:12.627 --> 29:16.172
Which is why I suspect
someone wanted us to catch 'em.

29:16.422 --> 29:19.342
You mean there's another
fiendish force behind these crimes?

29:19.592 --> 29:20.593
But who?

29:20.843 --> 29:25.265
Think, Robin. What common theme
do the stolen books all share?

29:25.807 --> 29:26.849
Hmm.

29:27.100 --> 29:30.186
They were all stories
featuring themes of duality.

29:30.395 --> 29:35.984
I see Tut's crimes, though Egyptian
themed, also focused on the number two.

29:36.150 --> 29:39.070
The biplane, the double-decker bus.

29:39.445 --> 29:41.823
The number two? A double-cross.

32:29.365 --> 32:33.035
behind King Tut's and Bookworm's
latest crime sprees.

32:33.578 --> 32:35.413
The audacity.

32:35.705 --> 32:36.706
There's more.

32:36.914 --> 32:39.625

32:49.093 --> 32:51.762
Why, it's positively beyond the pale.

32:52.221 --> 32:54.724
Excuse Robin's over-zealousness, Mr. Dent,

32:54.932 --> 32:57.310
but we can't rule anyone out at this point.

32:57.727 --> 32:59.479
Of course, Batman.

You'll receive my full cooperation.

33:15.161 --> 33:17.663
I've total confidence in you, Caped Crusader.

33:17.872 --> 33:19.582
And I quiver with anticipation

33:19.749 --> 33:23.586

putting this imposter behind bars.

Perhaps you've heard about it
from our mutual friend Bruce Wayne?

33:31.761 --> 33:36.516
I'm afraid my friendship with Mr. Wayne
doesn't extend to charity functions.

33:36.933 --> 33:38.351
Good night, Mr. Dent.

33:50.112 --> 33:51.614
It just doesn't add up, Batman.

33:51.948 --> 33:54.617
Harvey has to be involved
with Two-Face somehow.

33:54.825 --> 33:58.788
The crime fighter's crusade
not tempered by loyalty and faith

33:58.955 --> 34:00.414
is hollow at best.

34:00.706 --> 34:02.625
Harvey Dent has been a loyal friend.

34:02.792 --> 34:05.253
Therefore, I must have faith in him.

34:05.962 --> 34:06.963

01:00:58.614 --> 01:01:00.658
(HARVEY SCREAMING)

01:01:06.831 --> 01:01:13.087
There's no one left to protect you,
Masked Manhunter. (GROWLS)

01:01:14.755 --> 01:01:16.090
- (GUNS CLICK)
- (GRUNTS)

01:01:17.925 --> 01:01:19.510
BATMAN: I've been counting your bullets.

01:01:19.677 --> 01:01:21.721
Now it's you that's on the auction block,

01:01:21.888 --> 01:01:24.432
and my fists are the highest bidders.

01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:25.766
(GROWLS)

01:01:25.975 --> 01:01:27.101
(BOTH GRUNTING)

01:01:35.776 --> 01:01:37.195
Harvey, stay strong.

01:01:37.945 --> 01:01:39.113
(GROANS)

01:01:42.074 --> 01:01:43.701
(GROWLING)

01:01:44.702 --> 01:01:46.162
(GRUNTING)

01:01:46.454 --> 01:01:47.955
(AIR WHISTLING)

01:01:50.958 --> 01:01:52.168
(BOTH GRUNTING)

01:01:59.425 --> 01:02:01.093
(GROANING)

01:02:01.385 --> 01:02:02.386
(GASPS)

01:02:03.638 --> 01:02:05.097
(BOTH GRUNTING)

01:02:11.854 --> 01:02:12.980
(GROANS)

01:02:14.190 --> 01:02:16.442
Goodbye, Batman.

01:02:16.609 --> 01:02:19.820
Wait, doesn't the coin have to decide?

01:02:22.531 --> 01:02:25.076
Curse you, Batman, for being right.

01:02:29.622 --> 01:02:31.832
No! Impossible!

01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:35.836
Oh.

01:02:38.464 --> 01:02:39.674
(GRUNTS)

01:02:39.924 --> 01:02:41.592
No!

01:02:41.759 --> 01:02:43.636
Tell me what to do.

01:02:43.803 --> 01:02:46.013
Can't decide.

01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:49.016
Now's your chance, Harvey, fight him.

01:02:49.350 --> 01:02:50.351
(STRAINING)

01:02:50.518 --> 01:02:52.061
(YELLING)

01:02:58.526 --> 01:03:00.194
You did this.

01:03:00.444 --> 01:03:02.530
I'll destroy you.

01:03:02.947 --> 01:03:05.283
No, he's my friend.

01:03:05.449 --> 01:03:07.410
He believed in me when no one else would.

01:03:07.576 --> 01:03:09.537
He was a fool to trust us.

01:03:09.704 --> 01:03:12.498
There's no us anymore, Two-Face.

01:03:13.749 --> 01:03:16.210
I'm Harvey Dent... (GRUNTS)

01:03:16.377 --> 01:03:18.296
District Attorney... (GRUNTS)

01:03:18.462 --> 01:03:21.507
And I'm bringing you to justice. (GROANS)

01:03:23.009 --> 01:03:24.719
(GRUNTING)

01:03:27.013 --> 01:03:28.973
(GROANING)

01:03:31.058 --> 01:03:32.059
Harvey!

01:03:51.287 --> 01:03:54.665
Batman. Bruce, old friend.

01:03:58.753 --> 01:04:00.713
BATMAN: Let's get out of here, Harvey.

01:04:17.938 --> 01:04:19.774
Batman, are you all right?

01:04:20.107 --> 01:04:21.484
- I'm fine, Robin.
- (SIRENS BLARING)

01:04:21.692 --> 01:04:23.110
What about Two-Face?

01:04:23.527 --> 01:04:25.279
He's gone, Boy Wonder.

01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:27.740
He's... (GROANS)

01:04:41.003 --> 01:04:44.298
GORDON: Batman, we rounded up
all of the super criminals.

01:04:44.465 --> 01:04:46.133
But Catwoman's gone.

01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:48.177
That tricky minx.

01:04:48.344 --> 01:04:51.305
Still, Robin and I owe our lives to her.

01:04:51.764 --> 01:04:56.060
However were you able to outwit that
Grand Guignol gonzo, Two-Face?

01:04:56.352 --> 01:04:58.938
I'm afraid to say I cheated, Commissioner.

01:04:59.105 --> 01:05:02.817
During our fight,
I replaced Two-Face's coin with a blank.

01:05:03.025 --> 01:05:06.445
His inability to act
gave me the opening I needed.

01:05:06.612 --> 01:05:08.864
That poor abandoned soul.

01:05:09.115 --> 01:05:11.992
But even Harvey Dent must again
pay for his crimes

01:05:12.159 --> 01:05:14.036
no matter what his mental state.

01:05:14.203 --> 01:05:17.498
True, but for now,
there's quite a mess in Gotham

01:05:17.665 --> 01:05:18.833
we must clean up.

01:05:25.506 --> 01:05:29.301
Initiating Bat-evil-essence antidote bombs.

01:05:29.510 --> 01:05:30.511
(BEEPING)

01:05:31.053 --> 01:05:32.596
(BOMBS WHISTLING)

01:05:49.155 --> 01:05:51.699
- (CONTINUES FIRING)
- Take that, you two-faced fiends!

01:05:51.866 --> 01:05:55.536
Decorum, old chum,
they are citizens after all.

01:05:56.203 --> 01:05:58.372
Gosh, yes. Sorry, Batman.

01:05:58.622 --> 01:06:00.166
(CONTINUES FIRING)

01:06:01.083 --> 01:06:03.669
Batman's cured all of Gotham.

01:06:03.836 --> 01:06:05.838
That is, most of Gotham.

01:06:06.672 --> 01:06:08.716
(GROWLING)

01:06:11.051 --> 01:06:12.511
- (BOMB WHISTLING)
- (GRUNTS)

01:06:15.890 --> 01:06:19.894
Faith and begorrah. I feel like I've been
on a three-day bender.

01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:28.486
GORDON: No matter how dire the peril,

01:06:28.652 --> 01:06:31.197
no matter how hopeless the odds,

01:06:31.906 --> 01:06:34.408
you can always count on Batman.

01:06:42.958 --> 01:06:44.668
Gosh, Bruce, it's been months.

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:47.296
How do you think Harvey will act
when he sees us?

01:06:47.463 --> 01:06:49.840
The warden says
Harvey's been a model prisoner.

01:06:50.007 --> 01:06:52.593
I mean, about him
knowing our secret identities.

01:06:52.843 --> 01:06:57.097
This is one time I'm afraid
even Batman doesn't know what to expect.

01:06:57.264 --> 01:07:01.810
Master Bruce, Mr. Dent has arrived
for his charity bachelor auction.

01:07:12.613 --> 01:07:14.114
Thanks, Bruce.

01:07:14.281 --> 01:07:17.701
Once again, you've helped me
in ways I can never begin to repay.

01:07:17.868 --> 01:07:21.830
Ah, don't mention it, Harvey,
that's what old friends are for.

01:07:21.997 --> 01:07:23.707
Say, I'd better get up there.

01:07:24.792 --> 01:07:27.086
Holy amnesia! He doesn't remember.

01:07:27.253 --> 01:07:28.629
Two-Face knew our secret,

01:07:28.796 --> 01:07:32.174
but it seems Harvey has
repressed that memory.

01:07:32.341 --> 01:07:36.136
Clearly, Two-Face lies dormant,
buried deep in Harvey's psyche.

01:07:36.303 --> 01:07:39.014
For now, we can only hope it stays that way.

01:07:39.265 --> 01:07:41.016
(CROWD CHEERING)

01:07:43.310 --> 01:07:47.690
I wonder if Harvey
will be auctioning himself.

01:07:48.148 --> 01:07:50.776
(LAUGHING) Oh!

01:07:50.985 --> 01:07:53.737
I might need to borrow some money, Alfred.

01:07:53.904 --> 01:07:55.281
Why, Mrs. Cooper.

01:07:55.864 --> 01:07:59.493
Heavens to Betsy, I'm all a tingle, Bruce.

01:07:59.660 --> 01:08:00.744
Bruce?

01:08:02.746 --> 01:08:03.998
HARVEY: <i>Thank you for that warm welcome.</i>

01:08:04.164 --> 01:08:05.332
<i>And now, without further ado,</i>

01:08:05.541 --> 01:08:08.335
I'd like to present
our first item up for auction,

01:08:08.502 --> 01:08:12.673
the most eligible bachelor in Gotham City,

01:08:14.550 --> 01:08:16.010
Batman.

01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:17.511
(ALL GASPS)

(ALL EXCLAIMING)

01:08:24.393 --> 01:08:26.520
Who will make the first bid?

01:08:30.941 --> 01:08:32.609
Holy Hugh Hefner!

01:08:33.694 --> 01:08:35.404
Meow.
