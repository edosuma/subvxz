WEBVTT

00:01.584 --> 00:03.302
I've been thinking, when Ty gets out,

00:03.337 --> 00:05.141
you guys move into the one-bedroom,

00:05.146 --> 00:06.537
and Ana and Isabelle
will move in with me.

00:06.547 --> 00:08.808
Troy Johnson said he was working here

00:08.857 --> 00:10.916
- the day that Martha Johnson was murdered.
- No, Callie, no!

00:10.936 --> 00:12.037
Your trial is comin' up.

00:12.051 --> 00:14.406
You need to be thinking about that,
not worrying about some murder.

00:14.456 --> 00:16.819
I'm gonna call the cops if
you ever come near me again!

00:17.173 --> 00:19.120
Callie saw AJ kissing another girl.

00:19.154 --> 00:21.223
- Do you like her?
- Yeah. I like her.

00:21.259 --> 00:23.333
So, Jesus didn't read my letter...

00:23.387 --> 00:25.354
- because he can't read.
- What's that?

00:25.418 --> 00:27.890
It's the letter Emma wrote to Jesus.

00:27.931 --> 00:31.100
- What are you doing with it?
- Emma didn't want anyone else finding it.

00:31.135 --> 00:34.387
- Emma's pregnant?
- No, she isn't pregnant... anymore.

00:34.451 --> 00:37.046
I... want to build it.

00:37.080 --> 00:39.543
What if... we ask Gabe to help?

00:39.567 --> 00:41.833
Are you guys all here for LGBTQ sex-ed?

00:41.883 --> 00:44.969
To require a permission slip from ABCC,

00:44.978 --> 00:46.343
implicates the school.

00:46.371 --> 00:47.685
We're asking you to resign.

00:47.731 --> 00:50.301
It wasn't a parent who told
Lauren about the sex-ed class.

00:50.320 --> 00:51.911
Drew told Lauren?

00:51.948 --> 00:53.885
Guess who they're
making interim principal?

00:56.707 --> 00:58.815
I feel like I should quit in solidarity!

00:58.935 --> 01:01.390
I mean, Drew totally
threw Monte under the bus.

01:01.399 --> 01:04.816
I'm sure it's only a matter of
time before he stabs me in the back.

01:04.848 --> 01:06.522
I don't know about that, Lena.

01:06.577 --> 01:08.173
He got the job that he wanted.

01:08.224 --> 01:10.507
He can't run the school
without you; he needs you.

01:10.516 --> 01:13.572
Besides, you love ABCC.
Our kids go to school there.

01:13.641 --> 01:15.910
You're really gonna give
this up without a fight?

01:18.936 --> 01:20.062
Is that work?

01:20.182 --> 01:22.359
No, it's about Callie.

01:29.499 --> 01:31.095
Gabe, hey!

01:31.318 --> 01:32.785
What's going on?

01:32.820 --> 01:34.120
What are you doing?

01:34.185 --> 01:37.325
I... tried calling you, but
your phone's disconnected.

01:37.749 --> 01:41.231
Uh, yeah, I am, uh, moving.

01:41.642 --> 01:46.504
Got a job in Lake Tahoe, so...

01:46.818 --> 01:48.340
Wait, you what?

01:49.133 --> 01:51.361
- Were you gonna tell us?
- Of course.

01:51.417 --> 01:54.618
Ah, just it happened really fast and...

01:55.406 --> 01:58.234
So, what... why... why
are you looking for me?

01:58.243 --> 02:01.242
Jesus and I want to build
this massive tree house, and...

02:01.496 --> 02:03.036
I don't know, I...

02:03.073 --> 02:04.844
I thought that you could help.

02:06.942 --> 02:08.262
I found bread!

02:08.285 --> 02:10.568
Oh, wait, never mind, it's
just the butts, you want 'em?

02:10.614 --> 02:12.293
Yeah, I don't mind butts
as long as I have jam.

02:12.316 --> 02:14.530
- Yeah, I'm not touching that.
- That's what she said.

02:14.558 --> 02:15.790
Wow.

02:16.242 --> 02:17.926
- Morning, everybody.
- Okay...

02:17.968 --> 02:20.597
there is literally
no food in this house.

02:20.629 --> 02:22.290
I know, sorry, sorry!

02:22.332 --> 02:23.923
I did not have time to
go to the store yesterday,

02:23.932 --> 02:25.468
but I will go today, I promise.

02:25.523 --> 02:27.967
Hey, Mama, do you think that Noah and I

02:27.986 --> 02:29.517
could decorate Taylor's
locker this weekend?

02:29.535 --> 02:30.836
Her birthday is on Monday.

02:30.864 --> 02:32.230
Oh, honey, that's really sweet,

02:32.239 --> 02:33.332
but you know it's not allowed.

02:33.346 --> 02:35.570
They consider it
defacing school property.

02:35.593 --> 02:37.027
Well, that's kinda harsh, isn't it?

02:37.078 --> 02:39.763
Hey, so what do you guys think
about, uh, giving Jesus my room?

02:39.966 --> 02:41.945
Like, permanently?

02:42.646 --> 02:45.119
Really? That's awfully nice of you, B.

02:45.308 --> 02:47.107
Well, not so nice.

02:47.125 --> 02:49.878
I was kind of hoping I could
move into the... garage?

02:51.628 --> 02:54.178
Well, Callie and Mariana might
have an opinion about that.

02:54.251 --> 02:57.000
Well, I'm sure Mariana
will have an opinion, but...

02:57.032 --> 02:58.790
I'm fine with it, I don't
want to sleep up there.

02:58.836 --> 03:00.233
I think that's a great idea.

03:00.247 --> 03:02.434
Oh, do you? Well, we will talk about it.

03:02.461 --> 03:03.584
Why don't you guys get a move on?

03:03.587 --> 03:05.662
Your brains are not going
to enrich themselves.

03:05.920 --> 03:07.489
Callie, can, uh...

03:07.530 --> 03:09.283
- Can we talk to you for a second?
- Yep.

03:11.068 --> 03:13.070
So, we talked to your lawyers,

03:13.079 --> 03:15.248
and the, uh, the trial
date has been set.

03:16.055 --> 03:17.559
Okay, when is it?

03:17.872 --> 03:19.745
Well, there must have been
an opening in the schedule,

03:19.773 --> 03:21.932
because it's a week from today.

03:23.000 --> 03:29.074

04:07.032 --> 04:09.588
Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry!

04:11.951 --> 04:15.042
I figured you might want
that after homo sex-ed.

04:29.688 --> 04:31.262
I want you to know...

04:31.382 --> 04:33.789
I feel terrible about
what happened with Monte.

04:33.812 --> 04:37.767
I... I never wanted her job,
and I know you two are close.

04:38.384 --> 04:40.615
Aw, I... I mean, not really.

04:40.783 --> 04:43.423
Monte and I didn't
always see eye to eye.

04:44.017 --> 04:46.099
So, it'll be nice to...
to work with someone

04:46.116 --> 04:48.566
with an educational background again.

04:50.042 --> 04:53.259
Anyway, we were just lucky
that you were here to step in.

04:53.819 --> 04:55.311
In the meantime, if you need any help,

04:55.323 --> 04:57.243
I'd be happy to take some work home.

04:57.363 --> 05:00.726
Uh, that would be fantastic.

05:01.083 --> 05:02.496
- Oh!
- Yeah.

05:02.547 --> 05:04.116
And then...

05:04.525 --> 05:06.094
That guy!

05:06.151 --> 05:08.486
It's heavy.

05:09.738 --> 05:11.773
So, Troy's manager at the dive shop said

05:11.791 --> 05:14.143
that he was working at the time
that Martha Johnson was killed.

05:14.189 --> 05:16.363
- Right.
- Right, and four years later,

05:16.391 --> 05:18.421
they're in a relationship.

05:18.479 --> 05:19.966
Troy and the manager, I mean,

05:19.978 --> 05:22.013
what if they were having
an affair back then?

05:22.082 --> 05:24.839
She was married before,
and now she's not anymore.

05:24.890 --> 05:27.179
What if that's what ended things?

05:27.299 --> 05:28.967
Well, if there's any truth to that,

05:29.013 --> 05:31.706
she loses all credibility as his alibi.

05:31.826 --> 05:34.018
I don't think Vanessa's
gonna want to talk about it,

05:34.024 --> 05:36.313
but maybe her ex-husband would.

05:37.517 --> 05:39.662
Do your lawyers know about this?

05:39.708 --> 05:42.315
Well, they don't believe that
Troy killed his grandmother.

05:42.361 --> 05:44.898
I can't tell them about
the DNA evidence we found.

05:45.018 --> 05:47.872
Unless I wanna add breaking
into Doug Harvey's house

05:47.895 --> 05:49.227
to the list of charges against me.

05:49.347 --> 05:52.490
Do you know, uh, where
Vanessa's ex-husband lives?

05:52.610 --> 05:55.050
Uh, yeah, Los Angeles.

05:56.336 --> 05:58.118
Well, um...

05:58.354 --> 06:00.706
I'm actually headed to LA later.

06:00.971 --> 06:02.921
It's my dad's birthday.

06:03.106 --> 06:05.326
You don't seem very happy about it.

06:05.458 --> 06:07.632
It's complicated.

06:08.087 --> 06:11.091
But maybe I could go

06:11.143 --> 06:13.466
check on the ex, see what he has to say?

06:13.997 --> 06:16.344
Or maybe you could come with me?

06:16.464 --> 06:19.002
Get some answers, be my buffer?

06:20.466 --> 06:22.980
I guess AJ wouldn't
be too cool with that.

06:23.241 --> 06:25.174
I don't think AJ would care.

06:27.278 --> 06:28.884
So, is that a yes?

06:33.076 --> 06:34.327
Mama?

06:35.336 --> 06:36.939
Hey!

06:37.059 --> 06:42.629
Um, so can I go with Aaron
to visit his parents in LA?

06:42.653 --> 06:45.789
Oh, honey, I really don't
think that's such a great idea.

06:45.829 --> 06:48.130
I mean with your trial coming
up on top of everything else?

06:48.153 --> 06:49.865
I don't wanna spend the whole weekend

06:49.882 --> 06:51.687
just sitting around
thinking about the trial.

06:51.733 --> 06:54.010
It's only overnight.

06:54.472 --> 06:56.271
I need to check with Mom.

06:56.317 --> 06:58.807
Yeah, um, we kinda
need to know now though,

06:58.819 --> 07:00.814
so we can beat the traffic.

07:01.345 --> 07:02.717
Please, Mama!

07:02.757 --> 07:04.689
Aaron wants a buffer, because I guess

07:04.723 --> 07:07.174
he doesn't have the best
relationship with his parents.

07:07.433 --> 07:09.814
And you promise you're really
just going to go hang out

07:09.837 --> 07:11.757
with Aaron's parents, at their house?

07:11.792 --> 07:14.173
Promise. You can even call
his parents if you want.

07:14.196 --> 07:15.758
I do want.

07:20.008 --> 07:22.470
Hey, it's Stef, please leave a message.

07:22.590 --> 07:24.332
Hey, call me back.

07:27.243 --> 07:28.345
Fine.

07:28.465 --> 07:31.746
But you're not going anywhere
near Aaron's death-cycle.

07:31.769 --> 07:33.389
Take the Mini.

07:33.694 --> 07:34.922
Okay, thank you.

07:34.940 --> 07:37.806
- Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
- Oh!

07:38.526 --> 07:40.469
Text me their number!

07:51.724 --> 07:53.448
What? You okay?

07:53.568 --> 07:54.988
Is...

07:55.841 --> 07:57.363
this safe for you?

07:58.003 --> 08:00.681
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

08:01.431 --> 08:02.889
But you're not sure.

08:03.679 --> 08:07.266
What, do you want, like, a
doctor's note or something?

08:07.992 --> 08:09.866
Kinda.

08:10.442 --> 08:12.974
I shouldn't have said yes?
I got to take this job!

08:13.037 --> 08:14.892
You know, but I just...

08:15.298 --> 08:18.053
I just didn't want to
disappoint the twins again.

08:18.117 --> 08:19.849
So don't, stay.

08:20.158 --> 08:21.680
I'm living in my truck.

08:22.086 --> 08:23.623
I, uh...

08:23.887 --> 08:26.466
I got evicted, that's... that's
why I took the job in Tahoe.

08:26.507 --> 08:29.435
- Wait, you got evicted?
- Yeah, I was, um...

08:29.760 --> 08:32.703
You know, going through a rough
time, and... and... and I just...

08:33.597 --> 08:35.897
I stopped showing up for jobs.

08:35.932 --> 08:39.409
Now, Mariana and Jesus need me.

08:39.714 --> 08:42.568
I can't help them, because
I messed up... again.

08:43.548 --> 08:45.670
Look, you gotta talk to them for me.

08:45.699 --> 08:47.106
Please, I...

08:47.296 --> 08:49.574
I just don't think I can face them.

08:50.078 --> 08:51.840
I... I will.

08:52.682 --> 08:53.980
Thank you.

08:59.773 --> 09:01.353
Everything okay?

09:06.888 --> 09:09.200
- Okay.
- Have fun at wrestling.

09:09.816 --> 09:11.252
Bye.

09:14.411 --> 09:16.400
Can I have sex?

09:19.029 --> 09:20.361
Uh...

09:20.950 --> 09:23.521
Wow, uh, okay.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.560
Well, as you know...

09:26.577 --> 09:29.905
Mom and I don't encourage
it, because you're so young,

09:30.025 --> 09:33.691
but if you do, we... we insist
that you practice safe sex.

09:33.693 --> 09:35.526
No, yeah, yeah, I know that, Mama.

09:35.567 --> 09:37.769
I mean, like, with my TBI, is it...

09:38.184 --> 09:40.889
uh... dangerous?

09:41.073 --> 09:43.552
Uh, sex with your TBI?

09:44.348 --> 09:46.652
Maybe, honey, I... I don't know.

09:47.260 --> 09:49.687
Yeah, well, can you call my doctor?

09:50.044 --> 09:51.664
You want me to call your doctor and ask

09:51.699 --> 09:53.590
if my 16-year-old son can have sex?

09:53.971 --> 09:55.845
Yeah, please.

09:57.615 --> 10:00.515
Okay, fine, I will.

10:06.874 --> 10:08.333
So, are you gonna call now?

10:08.362 --> 10:10.755
- Jesus!
- Well, I just...

10:18.215 --> 10:21.444
_

10:34.880 --> 10:37.550
- It's nice.
- Yeah.

10:48.730 --> 10:51.330
- Hello?
- Hey!

10:51.450 --> 10:53.290
Oh!

10:54.819 --> 10:56.497
Uh, Mom, this is Callie.

10:56.555 --> 10:58.191
- Hi.
- Callie, welcome.

10:58.220 --> 11:00.268
- Thank you.
- Welcome, how was the drive?

11:00.296 --> 11:02.423
It was good, it was easy.
There was almost no traffic.

11:02.481 --> 11:03.559
Good.

11:04.747 --> 11:07.368
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

11:07.488 --> 11:09.952
- Hi, I'm Callie.
- So nice to meet you.

11:10.072 --> 11:11.820
- What's up?
- What's up?

11:13.308 --> 11:15.954
Evan, could you show
Callie to her room, please?

11:16.000 --> 11:17.096
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

11:17.136 --> 11:20.169
- You have a beautiful home.
- Thank you, very sweet.

11:20.209 --> 11:22.106
Uh, dinner should be ready in an hour.

11:22.170 --> 11:25.520
Allison, could you come help
me in the kitchen, please?

11:51.991 --> 11:54.839
- Hey, your room okay?
- Yeah.

11:56.223 --> 12:00.392
Totally. It's, uh,
pretty cool wallpaper.

12:00.512 --> 12:03.163
Oh, thank you.

12:03.198 --> 12:06.525
Okay, alright, easy,
bro. Come on, relax.

12:06.645 --> 12:08.589
So, are you a lesbian?

12:09.119 --> 12:11.495
His last girlfriend was a
lesbian, oh, no, wait, no!

12:11.529 --> 12:13.980
- She was straight, he was the lesbian.
- Evan.

12:14.003 --> 12:16.050
Chill, okay, Callie has a boyfriend.

12:16.068 --> 12:18.120
- Go help Mom, go.
- Alright.

12:18.921 --> 12:20.967
- Sorry.
- No, it's okay.

12:21.181 --> 12:22.606
He's fun.

12:24.797 --> 12:26.117
Um...

12:26.890 --> 12:30.395
I don't have a boyfriend
anymore, actually, um...

12:30.418 --> 12:33.025
- AJ and I broke up.
- Oh.

12:33.544 --> 12:36.744
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, it's for the best.

12:36.911 --> 12:40.141
- I mean, I'm probably going to jail.
- Callie, going to jail is, like,

12:40.261 --> 12:41.916
the worst-case scenario.

12:41.956 --> 12:43.650
Well, what about Vanessa's ex-husband?

12:43.679 --> 12:45.668
He could still crack Troy's alibi.

12:45.686 --> 12:49.890
Short of him producing a video tape of

12:50.010 --> 12:53.395
Troy murdering Martha, I
really don't see how it helps.

12:53.978 --> 12:56.405
I could still get a plea deal.

12:57.356 --> 12:59.421
Have you talked to your moms about that?

12:59.824 --> 13:00.989
No.

13:01.271 --> 13:04.638
I just don't think I can handle a trial.

13:07.030 --> 13:09.786
Those people saying
awful things about me.

13:10.466 --> 13:12.242
You can't give up though.

13:12.692 --> 13:16.376
Is it giving up, or is it being smart?

13:17.956 --> 13:19.894
Your mom's gonna know you did this.

13:19.928 --> 13:21.998
Totally worth it. She's gonna love it.

13:22.021 --> 13:24.344
Hope so. Now let's get out of here.

13:24.464 --> 13:27.486
Hold on, I want to see what
I got on my history test.

13:34.527 --> 13:36.614
B-plus, not bad.

13:37.289 --> 13:39.734
Is this the class where the
kid put the dildo on your chair?

13:40.679 --> 13:41.936
Yeah.

13:42.056 --> 13:44.392
Let's see what that douche bag got.

13:46.006 --> 13:48.145
Nice work, Todd.

13:48.265 --> 13:50.325
- _
- Karma's a bitch.

13:52.054 --> 13:53.945
So is payback.

13:57.439 --> 13:58.852
Alright.

13:58.972 --> 14:02.103
Could you please pass the
rolls, Allison... Aaron?

14:02.761 --> 14:04.519
I'm sorry.

14:04.686 --> 14:08.659
Allison was my mother's name,
and she was named after her.

14:08.705 --> 14:11.443
They're also both the biggest
cheaters you'll ever meet.

14:11.460 --> 14:13.277
- Like games, cards...
- Death.

14:13.397 --> 14:16.056
Nana lived way longer
than she was supposed to.

14:19.077 --> 14:21.960
Do you ever see Lindsay at UCSD?

14:22.237 --> 14:24.612
Who's that? The girl
in the prom picture?

14:24.647 --> 14:26.769
Mmm, they were a cute couple.

14:26.832 --> 14:29.738
Uh, we don't really talk anymore.

14:29.744 --> 14:31.888
She got into the sorority scene, so...

14:31.923 --> 14:33.915
Guess you won't be doing that.

14:34.499 --> 14:35.727
Dad.

14:35.964 --> 14:37.982
What? Only you get to joke?

14:39.908 --> 14:42.346
I, uh, I got you something.

14:45.251 --> 14:46.958
It's a first edition.

14:47.125 --> 14:48.820
I hope you like it.

14:48.872 --> 14:50.711
- Thanks.
- _

14:50.831 --> 14:52.446
Peas, please?

14:56.655 --> 14:58.362
Thank you.

14:59.429 --> 15:01.447
It was so gross.

15:01.470 --> 15:04.514
Kissing Drew's ass and
hanging Monte out to dry,

15:04.952 --> 15:07.599
but you're right! I'm
not giving ABCC up.

15:08.112 --> 15:10.222
Thought you were going
to the store today.

15:10.222 --> 15:12.090
Oh, I didn't have
time. I ordered pizzas.

15:12.441 --> 15:15.520
Pizza? That's the third
time this week, love.

15:15.572 --> 15:18.968
Drew gave me a stack of
paperwork as tall as Mariana.

15:19.038 --> 15:21.482
And, you know, there
are many grocery stores

15:21.499 --> 15:23.897
- between the station and home.
- Yeah, well,

15:23.926 --> 15:26.325
you know, I was just busy trying
to take down johns and pimps,

15:26.342 --> 15:28.275
but, you know, I'll make
sure and add that to my list.

15:28.303 --> 15:29.508
Wanna hear what's on my list

15:29.520 --> 15:33.019
besides trying to keep my
job and taking Jesus to rehab?

15:33.388 --> 15:36.179
Callie asked if she could go to
LA for the weekend with Aaron,

15:36.202 --> 15:38.531
and Jesus wants to
know if he can have sex.

15:38.900 --> 15:41.939
Wait, I hope you said "no" to both.

15:42.897 --> 15:44.038
Lena?

15:44.315 --> 15:46.529
Oh, my...

15:48.939 --> 15:51.424
Rose for the birthday boy.

15:51.544 --> 15:53.373
Oh! I gotta get the cake server.

15:53.610 --> 15:55.876
Oh, is that a tattoo?

15:56.695 --> 15:58.252
Bad ass.

15:58.430 --> 16:00.126
I got nothing to say about that.

16:00.178 --> 16:02.178
Oh, you do, you're
just not gonna say it.

16:02.183 --> 16:03.740
Fine.

16:05.176 --> 16:08.266
Haven't you mutilated yourself enough?

16:11.749 --> 16:13.975
Okay, , you know what, um...

16:13.980 --> 16:16.189
surgery is not mutilation.

16:16.213 --> 16:18.704
Aaron is a man. All he did was make sure

16:18.750 --> 16:20.077
that what he looks like on the outside

16:20.094 --> 16:22.435
- matches who he is on the inside.
- On the inside?

16:22.555 --> 16:24.805
On the inside? Underneath all of this,

16:24.816 --> 16:28.898
- is my daughter, Allison.
- He is your son, okay,

16:28.961 --> 16:32.513
and he is a wonderful,
caring, brave person,

16:32.536 --> 16:35.332
basically, the best guy I
know, and you should be proud...

16:35.355 --> 16:37.581
Okay, this is a birthday party.

16:37.627 --> 16:39.789
So, can we all get along?

16:39.991 --> 16:41.963
Who would like some cake?

16:48.945 --> 16:50.870
You think you might
be going a little far?

16:50.894 --> 16:53.448
He came after me twice for being gay.

16:53.488 --> 16:55.443
I don't think I'm going far enough.

16:59.600 --> 17:01.117
I feel bad for him.

17:01.237 --> 17:03.919
I just wish there were a way
that he could stay in town.

17:04.454 --> 17:08.231
I think it would be good
for him, and for the twins.

17:08.496 --> 17:10.394
He's gotta have some options. I mean,

17:10.423 --> 17:13.374
isn't there a family or
somebody that can help him out?

17:13.893 --> 17:15.646
He has us.

17:18.448 --> 17:20.904
What if he moved into the one-bedroom?

17:21.023 --> 17:24.122
The one-bedroom you're
moving into next week?

17:24.242 --> 17:26.433
It would just be temporary.

17:26.714 --> 17:29.472
Just until he got back on his feet.

17:29.541 --> 17:31.675
And where are you and
Isabella gonna live?

17:32.055 --> 17:33.716
You can't live with me and AJ.

17:33.935 --> 17:37.499
I guess we'll just stay at
my parents' a little longer.

17:40.970 --> 17:42.717
Gabe needs help.

17:51.399 --> 17:52.817
Hey.

17:56.248 --> 18:00.410
So if you wanna get out of
here, I'm like totally down.

18:00.451 --> 18:04.077
You just went off on my parents
at my dad's birthday dinner.

18:04.449 --> 18:06.916
You seriously think that's okay?

18:08.926 --> 18:11.059
I was defending you.

18:11.722 --> 18:13.889
- I can defend myself.
- But you didn't.

18:13.924 --> 18:16.485
You just sat there and let your family

18:16.485 --> 18:18.440
say really awful things about you.

18:18.462 --> 18:21.225
Look, I don't like the way they
treat me either, but I made a choice.

18:21.345 --> 18:25.786
I could... push them away,
or I could accept them.

18:26.120 --> 18:27.815
Yeah, but they don't accept you!

18:27.983 --> 18:30.509
You said it was complicated.
It's not complicated at all.

18:30.555 --> 18:32.895
- It's completely one-sided.
- They're family, Callie,

18:32.907 --> 18:34.700
- that's important to me.
- Why don't you say something?

18:34.700 --> 18:36.331
- It wouldn't make a difference.
- They don't even have any

18:36.379 --> 18:38.342
pictures of you in their
house, since you transitioned!

18:38.351 --> 18:39.296
Callie!

18:39.841 --> 18:41.774
This isn't something you can fix.

18:44.730 --> 18:46.497
Can we just...

18:47.593 --> 18:48.908
let it go?

18:49.714 --> 18:52.099
I'm tired, I want to sleep.

19:06.795 --> 19:08.705
Um, I think I'm gonna bail.

19:09.489 --> 19:10.485
Okay.

19:10.605 --> 19:11.906
I thought we were gonna hang out.

19:12.026 --> 19:15.702
Yeah, I just don't really feel
like being around you right now.

19:15.896 --> 19:18.658
I get that you're pissed
off and everything,

19:19.230 --> 19:20.314
but...

19:21.112 --> 19:22.694
bullying a bully?

19:23.321 --> 19:26.532
- Kinda makes you just as bad as him.
- I'm just supposed to take it?

19:26.952 --> 19:28.396
Let everyone make fun of me?

19:28.400 --> 19:30.772
I thought we were supposed
to stand up to the bullies.

19:30.795 --> 19:33.388
- There are better ways to fight back.
- Oh, come on!

19:33.423 --> 19:35.075
Bullies always win...

19:35.860 --> 19:37.487
and I'm tired of being a loser.

19:37.728 --> 19:40.624
What makes you a loser
is stooping to his level.

19:53.642 --> 19:56.257
Uh, have you and Mama decided
if I could move in the garage?

19:56.898 --> 19:59.961
Oh, it's all we talk about.
It's our number one priority.

19:59.993 --> 20:02.047
Well, Mama said she wouldn't
have a problem with it.

20:02.540 --> 20:03.652
Did she?

20:04.035 --> 20:06.083
Okay, well, I am still
thinking about it.

20:06.253 --> 20:09.611
I mean, you know, we could rent it
out for extra money, quite honestly.

20:09.662 --> 20:10.866
Mom.

20:10.986 --> 20:13.306
Hey, listen! If you would like to earn

20:13.324 --> 20:15.898
the privilege of living
out there, then you need

20:15.925 --> 20:18.604
to step up and start helping
out around the house more.

20:18.609 --> 20:19.854
Sure, okay.

20:20.186 --> 20:23.092
Great! Well, then, you
can start in the morning

20:23.106 --> 20:25.588
- with a grocery run.
- Easy enough.

20:25.708 --> 20:28.084
Okay, this is for groceries.

20:28.282 --> 20:30.336
Okay, and groceries only.

20:30.686 --> 20:31.900
Got it.

20:33.358 --> 20:35.350
My work here is done.

20:39.141 --> 20:40.502
How's paperwork going?

20:40.552 --> 20:42.448
- Oh, I haven't even made a dent.
- Oh.

20:42.508 --> 20:44.980
So, I just got off the
phone with Jesus' doctor.

20:45.035 --> 20:47.272
- Mm-hmm.
- And after one of the more

20:47.276 --> 20:50.067
awkward conversations
I've ever had in my life...

20:50.108 --> 20:55.054
Jesus is now cleared to resume
sexual activity with some limitations.

20:55.104 --> 20:57.729
Hey, well, thanks for the help, Doc.

20:58.402 --> 20:59.804
So...

20:59.994 --> 21:02.171
if we pass this along,

21:02.181 --> 21:05.110
does that mean we're
condoning him having sex?

21:05.179 --> 21:06.794
Well, he's having it anyway.

21:06.821 --> 21:08.923
What my concern is where he's having it.

21:09.543 --> 21:12.108
I don't want it happening in a car or...

21:12.458 --> 21:14.676
God knows where,
especially in his condition.

21:14.713 --> 21:16.203
You're saying that we should allow him

21:16.212 --> 21:18.006
to have sex in the house in his room?

21:18.035 --> 21:19.612
I don't know, I mean,

21:19.630 --> 21:20.848
the kids are getting older,

21:20.871 --> 21:23.907
and part of safe sex is having
it in a safe, private place.

21:23.930 --> 21:25.304
Great! So at any given time,

21:25.346 --> 21:28.021
our five kids could be here
having sex behind closed doors.

21:28.030 --> 21:30.526
- What are we running, a brothel?
- No, of course not.

21:30.558 --> 21:32.066
And Jude is too young.

21:32.514 --> 21:34.603
But I think that maybe
we need to think about

21:34.613 --> 21:36.398
relaxing the rules for the others.

21:37.252 --> 21:38.454
Oh.

21:38.763 --> 21:41.720
Okay! Well, whatever you think, honey.

21:46.926 --> 21:48.888
I'm gonna get ready for bed.

21:57.048 --> 21:58.348
Excuse me?

21:58.468 --> 22:00.497
Um, I just wanted to get some water.

22:00.534 --> 22:02.365
Oh, please, help yourself.

22:09.848 --> 22:12.851
I shouldn't have said
those things at dinner.

22:13.653 --> 22:14.930
No, it's okay.

22:15.290 --> 22:17.896
I'm really glad he
has a friend like you.

22:20.516 --> 22:22.836
She was such a beautiful girl.

22:24.344 --> 22:26.042
It's been really hard.

22:26.305 --> 22:28.196
I mean, especially for Jim.

22:31.010 --> 22:32.292
And me...

22:34.206 --> 22:36.055
I've lost a daughter too.

22:36.290 --> 22:37.659
Someone to

22:38.573 --> 22:41.806
go clothes shopping with,
and get our nails done...

22:43.066 --> 22:46.391
offer boyfriend advice,
or girlfriend advice.

22:46.419 --> 22:48.287
I mean, we were okay with that.

22:54.559 --> 22:56.602
I think the thing I was

22:56.985 --> 22:59.218
most looking forward to was...

22:59.983 --> 23:02.063
being a grandmother.

23:04.905 --> 23:06.916
Teach her how to change diapers,

23:06.930 --> 23:09.117
and what to do when the baby's teething.

23:10.054 --> 23:12.116
You can still be a grandmother.

23:12.143 --> 23:14.094
It's different when you have sons.

23:15.441 --> 23:19.167
Their wives have their own
mothers, and so you're just...

23:19.578 --> 23:21.114
not as involved.

23:26.025 --> 23:27.160
And then,

23:27.663 --> 23:31.063
I think of all the
pain that I caused her.

23:31.736 --> 23:34.111
Every time I put her in a dress,

23:34.231 --> 23:37.428
or had her take ballet,
or join the Girl Scouts.

23:37.447 --> 23:40.191
Things that I thought
would make her happy.

23:43.590 --> 23:46.565
I must have made her life so hard.

23:47.811 --> 23:50.138
And I always thought that we would be...

23:50.641 --> 23:53.695
best friends, but I don't know

23:53.733 --> 23:56.282
who is sleeping in
Allison's old room right now.

23:56.314 --> 23:58.777
He's the same person
that he's always been.

24:02.024 --> 24:03.704
And he...

24:04.622 --> 24:06.458
loves you.

24:06.928 --> 24:08.233
A lot.

24:13.206 --> 24:14.802
I know, I'm...

24:16.052 --> 24:17.851
I know you're right.

24:18.704 --> 24:23.966
And we are trying, I swear
we are trying so hard.

24:27.356 --> 24:29.126
I just wish he hadn't...

24:29.634 --> 24:31.838
done something so permanent.

25:06.815 --> 25:08.332
I'm sorry.

25:30.173 --> 25:31.575
- My mom hates it.
- Yeah.

25:31.585 --> 25:32.867
- Understandably.
- Hey.

25:32.987 --> 25:34.675
- Good morning.
- Morning.

25:34.947 --> 25:36.380
You're up early.

25:36.401 --> 25:38.098
She was getting us coffee and donuts.

25:38.218 --> 25:40.039
Lindsay never did that.

25:40.344 --> 25:41.802
Um, where's Dad?

25:41.875 --> 25:43.605
Uh, golf, of course.

25:43.615 --> 25:46.440
Right, and the donuts?

25:46.476 --> 25:47.475
In the kitchen.

25:47.840 --> 25:51.253
- Hey, I want that last fritter.
- Oh, okay.

25:51.502 --> 25:53.791
I, um, actually

25:53.911 --> 25:56.687
printed something out
for you while I was out.

26:03.814 --> 26:05.669
He's handsome, isn't he?

26:30.065 --> 26:32.234
Um, what is this about?

26:32.354 --> 26:35.278
Well, I finally heard
back from your doctor.

26:43.526 --> 26:46.832
So, Jesus was wondering
about his health...

26:47.275 --> 26:51.309
- in regards to sexual activity.
- Mama, she... she knows.

26:51.581 --> 26:53.914
Okay, before we start, Emma,

26:53.942 --> 26:56.547
I want to make sure that you
are comfortable discussing this.

26:56.698 --> 26:58.621
- Yep.
- Good.

26:58.632 --> 27:01.464
'Cause I think it's important that
you two are on the same page...

27:01.514 --> 27:03.608
with parameters.

27:04.600 --> 27:07.136
Uh... like... like what?

27:07.256 --> 27:08.881
Well, like, um...

27:09.800 --> 27:10.967
so...

27:11.399 --> 27:13.946
how do you... how do you guys have sex?

27:16.069 --> 27:20.608
Um, the normal way, I
mean, I... I think, yeah.

27:20.627 --> 27:22.176
What I mean is...

27:23.574 --> 27:26.641
don't do anything too strenuous, okay?

27:26.701 --> 27:29.685
No standing, no picking up,

27:29.698 --> 27:33.062
no in the shower stuff.

27:33.578 --> 27:36.567
Uh, just no acrobatics, basically.

27:36.640 --> 27:37.748
Got it.

27:38.025 --> 27:42.246
And the doctor also suggested
that Jesus be supine.

27:44.488 --> 27:46.794
What's... what is that?

27:47.195 --> 27:49.193
On the bottom.

27:50.747 --> 27:53.260
Right, so, uh, that way you won't

27:53.380 --> 27:55.151
exert yourself so much.

27:55.170 --> 27:57.088
Yeah, less work for me, no problem.

27:58.191 --> 28:00.428
Okay, also, um...

28:00.548 --> 28:02.767
given your circumstances,
we have decided

28:02.781 --> 28:05.184
to waive the "Closed Door" rule.

28:05.497 --> 28:06.724
For now,

28:06.997 --> 28:09.436
okay? We don't want you
sneaking off somewhere

28:09.455 --> 28:11.596
doing something somewhere unsafe.

28:11.609 --> 28:14.870
So... so I can... I mean, we, we...

28:15.410 --> 28:18.030
can do it in my room?

28:18.067 --> 28:20.927
- I am neither encouraging nor condoning.
- Got it.

28:21.203 --> 28:22.781
But use protection.

28:22.800 --> 28:25.284
D... done, and... and done!

28:25.320 --> 28:27.588
So, are we good?

28:27.768 --> 28:29.008
We're good.

28:30.383 --> 28:33.699
Just don't do it right now, please.

28:36.744 --> 28:39.230
The move is finally finished!

28:39.262 --> 28:40.406
Yay!

28:40.461 --> 28:42.615
Say, "Yay, Mama."

28:42.694 --> 28:44.100
Thank you for watching her.

28:44.142 --> 28:46.651
- Are you kidding? She's the best.
- Yes, she is.

28:49.606 --> 28:51.516
Gabe came by yesterday.

28:51.585 --> 28:53.601
He, uh, he's not gonna be able to help

28:53.721 --> 28:55.086
with the tree house.

28:55.118 --> 28:56.442
Seriously?

28:56.663 --> 28:58.245
- But he's...
- It's not what you think.

28:58.273 --> 29:00.100
He wants to help, he really does.

29:00.663 --> 29:02.435
Yeah, right.

29:02.725 --> 29:05.470
The thing is he doesn't
have a place to live,

29:05.520 --> 29:07.388
and if he doesn't
take this job up north,

29:07.393 --> 29:09.039
he's gonna be living out of his car.

29:09.159 --> 29:10.935
I think he's depressed.

29:11.165 --> 29:12.711
Well, he could have just said that.

29:12.744 --> 29:15.100
He was hoping he could
work something out.

29:15.289 --> 29:17.120
Anyway, he has a new number,

29:17.157 --> 29:19.039
and he wanted me to give it to you.

29:19.214 --> 29:22.235
- Thanks.
- You'll tell Jesus?

29:23.554 --> 29:24.897
Yeah.

29:26.391 --> 29:29.523
Bye, sweet girl, bye.

29:31.986 --> 29:33.826
- See ya, guys.
- Bye.

29:39.859 --> 29:41.188
Hi.

29:43.333 --> 29:46.921
Look, I hate to see
Mariana and Jesus let down,

29:47.120 --> 29:50.843
but I mean, you, me, Isabella, AJ, we...

29:51.097 --> 29:53.238
We've got a complicated situation

29:53.288 --> 29:55.022
and we're just starting
to figure it out.

29:55.096 --> 29:57.472
I feel like we're finally
moving forward, and I... I...

29:57.523 --> 29:59.378
I just don't want
anything to mess that up.

30:00.188 --> 30:02.021
I know, me neither.

30:03.224 --> 30:06.976
Do you wanna see your
new room, princesita ?

30:07.096 --> 30:08.715
I'm gonna put her down for a nap.

30:08.918 --> 30:10.181
Okay.

30:25.489 --> 30:27.514
This is weird, right?

30:27.578 --> 30:28.842
Mmm.

30:29.091 --> 30:30.179
I mean,

30:30.511 --> 30:32.606
every time your door is closed,

30:32.638 --> 30:35.286
it's like we're announcing to
your moms that we're having sex.

30:35.406 --> 30:37.052
I could live with that.

30:43.136 --> 30:44.787
Remember, don't move too much.

30:45.322 --> 30:46.955
Alright, my bad.

30:49.464 --> 30:51.056
Okay.

30:52.200 --> 30:55.738
Less work for you does
not mean no work at all.

31:08.172 --> 31:10.198
- Umm...
- I, uh...

31:11.181 --> 31:13.930
I think all that... the Mama sex talk.

31:13.967 --> 31:16.887
It's just, like, getting
in my head, I guess.

31:17.367 --> 31:19.331
Screw the rules, right?

31:37.381 --> 31:43.133
- This has... never been a problem.
- Trust me, I know.

31:45.669 --> 31:46.892
Maybe...

31:47.303 --> 31:49.009
maybe it's your meds?

31:50.019 --> 31:52.118
My aunt's on anti-depressants

31:52.131 --> 31:55.406
and she says that she has
no sex drive at all anymore.

31:57.218 --> 31:59.470
She's an... over-sharer.

32:12.106 --> 32:13.781
Oh, what was that for?

32:14.071 --> 32:15.934
For being the guy I knew you were.

32:25.724 --> 32:27.218
Thanks for coming in today.

32:27.255 --> 32:29.879
Sure, happy to be here.

32:29.906 --> 32:31.936
Now let me give you the tour.

32:34.172 --> 32:35.680
Hey, what's this?

32:35.800 --> 32:38.424
Oh, uh, Mom asked me to go to the store.

32:38.448 --> 32:40.080
I see.

32:40.292 --> 32:42.270
And why did you get these?

32:42.732 --> 32:43.779
A sale.

32:46.767 --> 32:47.985
Two for one.

32:49.604 --> 32:53.981
Uh, a lot of this was not
on the list, I'm quite sure.

32:54.004 --> 32:55.955
Uh, yeah, I kind of

32:56.020 --> 32:59.673
lost the list. So, I
just, sort of, winged it.

32:59.719 --> 33:01.753
Okay, well, where's...
where's the chicken?

33:01.776 --> 33:02.994
Do we need chicken?

33:04.487 --> 33:05.820
I will go back.

33:05.940 --> 33:08.534
Uh, no, you've done enough.

33:09.184 --> 33:11.274
I'll just have Mom
get it on her way home.

33:11.297 --> 33:12.556
She was supposed to do the shopping.

33:12.575 --> 33:14.775
Uh, isn't Mom working late tonight?

33:15.435 --> 33:19.365
Okay, get the chicken, only the chicken,

33:19.411 --> 33:21.768
or I will turn that garage
into a meditation room.

33:21.823 --> 33:23.244
God knows I could use it.

33:25.006 --> 33:27.273
- Question.
- What now?

33:27.349 --> 33:29.549
Gabe's homeless. Can
he move into the garage?

33:29.563 --> 33:31.459
Sure, why not!

33:31.579 --> 33:34.306
Oh, thank God, cause I
already told him "yes."

33:37.255 --> 33:39.081
I really believe Anchor Beach

33:39.127 --> 33:41.221
could be one of the top prep
schools in Southern California,

33:41.267 --> 33:42.582
and maybe the country.

33:42.656 --> 33:43.772
Who is that?

33:44.007 --> 33:45.635
Well, one of them's the new principal.

33:45.709 --> 33:47.526
What are they doing here on a Saturday?

33:47.549 --> 33:49.883
We're gonna need more
classrooms, of course,

33:49.916 --> 33:53.200
- and a new auditorium.
- But school's right on the beach!

33:53.228 --> 33:54.671
Parents will pay a premium

33:54.727 --> 33:56.323
- to send their kids here.
- Yeah.

33:56.443 --> 33:59.040
So, what kind of endowment do
you think we're going to need

33:59.114 --> 34:01.356
to convert Anchor Beach
from charter to private?

34:01.425 --> 34:03.386
Oh, ten million?

34:03.441 --> 34:04.977
I can make that happen.

34:08.295 --> 34:09.629
Does your mom know about this?

34:09.664 --> 34:10.996
Uh, she must, right?

34:23.551 --> 34:25.876
So, you were right.

34:25.913 --> 34:27.791
Vanessa was having an affair with Troy.

34:27.982 --> 34:29.931
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

34:29.982 --> 34:33.853
According to her ex-husband,
apparently, she was obsessed.

34:33.893 --> 34:35.246
Would have done anything for Troy.

34:35.554 --> 34:38.493
And he said that he was
willing to talk to the police,

34:38.507 --> 34:40.199
or your lawyers, or whatever we need.

34:40.319 --> 34:42.016
I know it's not security footage, but...

34:42.063 --> 34:43.562
But it's something.

34:45.190 --> 34:48.119
- Thank you.
- Yeah, so...

34:48.350 --> 34:49.674
No plea deal?

34:51.772 --> 34:54.090
Well, if you can put
up with all the things

34:54.103 --> 34:57.118
your family says about
you, I think I can

34:57.326 --> 35:01.114
handle what some strangers
at a trial say about me, so...

35:01.524 --> 35:04.084
You did... you did a number on my mom.

35:04.435 --> 35:06.717
She put my picture on the mantle.

35:08.738 --> 35:11.672
Look, I, uh, I want you
to know that I don't...

35:12.027 --> 35:14.422
I know you're going through a
lot right now and I know you don't

35:14.542 --> 35:16.779
want attachments and...

35:16.950 --> 35:19.229
Last night probably didn't mean...

35:19.801 --> 35:23.006
It's fine if it was like
a road trip thing or...

35:29.445 --> 35:31.674
Or not, fine with that too.

35:34.810 --> 35:37.329
No one's out there! It's just empty.

35:37.393 --> 35:40.825
Please, Mama, Jesus needs Gabe
to help him with the tree house.

35:40.848 --> 35:44.205
- He can't do that from Tahoe.
- Mariana, it's a really big ask.

35:44.240 --> 35:46.725
I know, but I'm sure he'd
only be living out there

35:46.759 --> 35:49.171
- for a couple months tops.
- Out where?

35:49.509 --> 35:51.560
- The garage?
- Gabe's moving in.

35:51.592 --> 35:54.355
- Nothing has been decided yet.
- What about me?

35:54.590 --> 35:57.116
- What about you?
- I'm gonna move in the garage.

35:57.278 --> 35:59.745
- So Jesus can keep my room.
- How generous.

35:59.759 --> 36:02.406
Hey, I'm the one who offered
Jesus my room in the first place.

36:02.409 --> 36:04.164
Okay, well, what if I wanted
to live out there, huh?

36:04.192 --> 36:05.225
Do you?

36:05.248 --> 36:06.521
- Ew, no.
- Right.

36:07.591 --> 36:10.275
- Oh, hey, how was the trip?
- Oh, it was good.

36:10.395 --> 36:12.453
Callie already said she doesn't
want to move in the garage.

36:12.573 --> 36:14.169
- You did?
- Yeah!

36:14.192 --> 36:16.194
- I like sharing with you.
- Aw.

36:16.240 --> 36:18.112
I like sharing with you too.

36:18.592 --> 36:19.335
So?

36:19.409 --> 36:21.087
Okay, look, you have Jesus' bed,

36:21.115 --> 36:23.010
- Gabe doesn't have anywhere.
- Whoa,

36:23.052 --> 36:24.869
what... what about Gabe?

36:25.192 --> 36:29.182
Oh, uh, well, he needs a place
to stay if he's gonna help us, so

36:29.187 --> 36:32.258
- I volunteered the garage.
- Well, Mama, can he?

36:32.378 --> 36:35.270
I... I really need to
discuss this with Mom first.

36:35.298 --> 36:37.230
But if she says no,
does that mean that...

36:37.267 --> 36:40.140
that we don't get to
build the tree house?

36:40.948 --> 36:42.184
I'm sure we can...

36:42.220 --> 36:44.471
we can work something out. Brandon?

36:46.054 --> 36:48.452
Yeah, of course, sure.

36:48.742 --> 36:50.647
Okay, Jesus, your medication.

36:51.445 --> 36:53.949
How long do I have to take this for?

36:53.991 --> 36:55.279
Five years, honey.

36:58.051 --> 37:00.666
Are there any... side effects?

37:00.680 --> 37:02.635
Well, they usually list them
on the bottle. Let me have it.

37:02.659 --> 37:05.074
"Side effects include
dizziness, blurred vision,

37:05.093 --> 37:07.736
skin rash and impotence."

37:07.750 --> 37:09.466
Wait, wait a minute,
are you reading that?

37:10.397 --> 37:13.201
What? Am I? I... whoa!

37:13.243 --> 37:14.604
I am!

37:14.664 --> 37:16.596
- Oh my God!
- You're reading!

37:19.018 --> 37:20.799
- Yeah, yeah, no...
- Keep going, keep going.

37:20.804 --> 37:25.145
Um, I take one capsule by
mouth two to three times a day!

37:26.538 --> 37:27.382
Hey!

37:27.502 --> 37:30.136
Well, there's the happiest I've
seen you since the accident.

37:30.145 --> 37:33.319
Oh, I know, I'm just so grateful.

37:33.346 --> 37:35.699
Although I am gonna
kinda miss those glasses.

37:35.860 --> 37:38.249
Well, he still has to wear
them for a little while.

37:38.263 --> 37:40.569
- Yeah.
- Hey, you know, if you're hungry,

37:40.592 --> 37:42.917
there's still some leftover
chicken in the fridge.

37:43.401 --> 37:45.348
That I had send Brandon
back to the store

37:45.362 --> 37:46.907
to get since he forgot the list...

37:47.193 --> 37:51.663
- that you gave him.
- Oh, really? Gosh!

37:52.620 --> 37:54.261
I thought you were
gonna do the shopping.

37:54.720 --> 37:57.712
Well, I see no reasons why
the kids can't pitch in and...

37:57.775 --> 38:00.329
There is every reason, and we have
a giant plastic tub of Red Vines

38:00.358 --> 38:02.401
in the cupboard to prove it.

38:02.872 --> 38:06.199
You know, I really need you
to help out a little more.

38:07.485 --> 38:09.491
Really? 'Cause you seem to
have it covered, you know.

38:09.509 --> 38:11.567
Making all the decisions without me.

38:11.687 --> 38:13.980
I'm making all the decisions
because you're not here.

38:14.323 --> 38:15.413
Everything is on me.

38:15.453 --> 38:18.221
I... I had to have the sex
talk with Emma and Jesus alone.

38:18.423 --> 38:21.998
Had to deal with Mariana wanting
to move Gabe into the garage alone.

38:22.039 --> 38:25.163
I mean, am I gonna deal with Callie's
trial preparation all alone too?

38:25.198 --> 38:28.256
- No, sweetheart.
- No, I've got... I've got laundry

38:28.307 --> 38:29.396
that I'm doing.

38:30.642 --> 38:33.783
- Okay, you wanted me to take this job.
- I know.

38:35.234 --> 38:37.188
I just didn't think that I was...

38:37.571 --> 38:39.393
going to feel like a single parent.

38:41.543 --> 38:44.657
Okay, listen, sit with me.

38:44.777 --> 38:46.289
Hey.

38:46.846 --> 38:49.814
I appreciate everything that
you're doing for this family.

38:49.849 --> 38:52.871
I do, and I realize that
the majority of the burden

38:52.871 --> 38:56.132
is falling on your shoulders,
and I am sorry for that, I am.

38:56.522 --> 38:58.014
Well, I appreciate...

38:58.134 --> 38:59.711
all the extra hours you're working

38:59.739 --> 39:01.164
to make up for me being on leave.

39:01.192 --> 39:03.922
Okay, but it was never the
deal that you do everything,

39:03.945 --> 39:05.377
and I'm gonna try and do better,

39:05.407 --> 39:08.392
but I do think the
kids can help out more.

39:08.576 --> 39:10.154
They're old enough.

39:10.874 --> 39:12.207
Okay.

39:16.958 --> 39:19.730
- Are those marshmallows?
- Shut up.

39:19.790 --> 39:23.590
I was eating my feelings,
and I have a lot of feelings.

39:23.609 --> 39:25.427
And there's a lot of laundry.

39:25.464 --> 39:26.927
Would you like me to do the laundry?

39:26.936 --> 39:28.989
- Yes, please!
- Okay.

39:32.928 --> 39:36.250
Please tell me that you
didn't say Gabe could move in.

39:45.811 --> 39:49.469
Hey, so Mama said you
forgot to take your pill.

39:51.858 --> 39:53.592
- Thanks.
- Yep.

39:54.269 --> 39:55.400
Um...

39:56.032 --> 39:58.674
have you seen the letter Emma wrote me?

39:58.965 --> 40:00.202
No.

40:01.364 --> 40:02.780
I want to read it,

40:03.071 --> 40:06.175
now that I can.

40:07.172 --> 40:09.228
Um, yeah.

40:09.888 --> 40:11.885
Hey, thanks, by the way.

40:12.743 --> 40:14.279
For what?

40:14.635 --> 40:16.314
For giving me your room,

40:16.743 --> 40:19.653
and helping me with rehab.

40:21.179 --> 40:22.863
You're a good brother.

40:25.409 --> 40:27.696
And you're a good brother too.
