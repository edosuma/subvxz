00:01.533 --> 00:02.533
DONNELL:
Previously on The Practice...

00:02.566 --> 00:04.633
WEST: I am bound by the statute
to sentence you

00:04.666 --> 00:06.533
to the Framingham
Correction Facility

00:06.566 --> 00:08.600
for the remainder
of your natural life.

00:08.633 --> 00:11.033
WASHINGTON: The emotional
undercurrents of a case

00:11.066 --> 00:11.966
play a part.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.933
Give me this appeal.

00:13.966 --> 00:15.200
I'll bring your wife home.

00:15.233 --> 00:16.633
QUINCY: Basically,
you took your shot,

00:16.666 --> 00:18.133
and you're here because

00:18.166 --> 00:19.466
you don't like the result.

00:19.500 --> 00:21.200
I'm here because of something

00:21.233 --> 00:23.566
called the Fifth Amendment.

00:23.600 --> 00:27.200
I'm here because of something
called the Sixth Amendment,

00:27.233 --> 00:29.566
basic constitutional rights

00:29.600 --> 00:30.733
belonging to Lindsay Dole

00:30.766 --> 00:33.800
that the prosecutor
blatantly trampled.

00:33.833 --> 00:36.500
Mr. Walsh showed contempt

00:36.533 --> 00:38.200
for the constitution.

00:38.233 --> 00:40.333
The jury heard all the evidence.

00:40.366 --> 00:41.900
They were properly instructed,

00:41.933 --> 00:44.533
and they made
their unanimous finding.

00:44.566 --> 00:47.133
Ms. Dole lost.

00:47.166 --> 00:51.266
And this court
cannot disregard a verdict

00:51.300 --> 00:53.733
merely because
it disagrees with it.

00:56.266 --> 00:59.933
Lindsay's conviction
has been reversed.

01:00.540 --> 01:03.040
They've ordered a new trial.

01:03.073 --> 01:04.572
I don't give a damn.

01:04.605 --> 01:05.740
That isn't true.

01:05.773 --> 01:08.140
WALSH: Truth be told,
I hate that firm so much

01:08.173 --> 01:10.306
suddenly there's something
to get juiced for.

01:10.340 --> 01:11.806
You watch,
they'll come crawling,

01:11.840 --> 01:13.073
looking to plead.

01:16.606 --> 01:19.606
(music playing)

01:24.573 --> 01:25.706
(door opens)

01:27.073 --> 01:28.540
Hey.
DOLE: Hi.

01:30.673 --> 01:32.240
DONNELL: How you doing?

01:32.273 --> 01:33.473
DOLE: I'm good.

01:33.506 --> 01:35.073
And you?

01:35.106 --> 01:36.373
I'm fine.

01:41.173 --> 01:42.506
(sighs)

01:46.640 --> 01:48.106
Everyone agrees.

01:48.873 --> 01:50.106
I was the last holdout,

01:50.140 --> 01:51.773
but I was finally won over.

01:53.006 --> 01:54.573
We should try to plead,

01:55.573 --> 01:57.440
voluntary manslaughter.

01:58.940 --> 02:02.546
There's just too much evidence,

02:02.580 --> 02:05.613
your threat that
you'd shoot him hours before,

02:05.646 --> 02:07.080
he was unarmed,

02:07.113 --> 02:08.280
stationary,

02:08.312 --> 02:10.213
your testimony
from the first trial,

02:10.246 --> 02:11.713
it's too much.

02:12.813 --> 02:13.680
We'll lose.

02:16.180 --> 02:18.179
It'll likely be eight years.

02:19.946 --> 02:21.980
Good behavior...

02:22.013 --> 02:23.580
you'll be out in three.

02:25.380 --> 02:27.113
The alternative...

02:29.413 --> 02:31.180
is life.

02:31.213 --> 02:33.246
We just can't risk that.

02:37.680 --> 02:40.013
Has the prosecution
agreed to it?

02:41.446 --> 02:44.346
We plan to take it
to them in the morning.

02:44.380 --> 02:45.713
They should go along.

02:47.346 --> 02:49.080
Three years in prison?

02:49.113 --> 02:51.113
It's the best result.

02:54.113 --> 02:55.880
I wish there were another way.

03:00.453 --> 03:02.120
We should plead, Lindsay.

03:04.620 --> 03:05.886
Okay.

03:14.420 --> 03:17.420
(music playing)

04:03.193 --> 04:04.993
STRINGER:
What do you mean trial? Today?

04:05.026 --> 04:06.226
BERLUTI:
If you can't plead it,

04:06.260 --> 04:08.226
which I highly recommend.

04:08.260 --> 04:09.826
The guy's got two priors.

04:09.860 --> 04:11.560
Lewd and lascivious.

04:11.593 --> 04:12.826
What did he do?

04:12.860 --> 04:14.260
Flashed some teenagers.

04:14.293 --> 04:15.226
It's a dog.

04:15.260 --> 04:16.260
Look, if you don't want it--

04:16.293 --> 04:17.760
Oh, no, no, no.
I do. I do.

04:17.793 --> 04:20.093
It's just it's not much time
to prepare.

04:20.125 --> 04:22.660
BERLUTI: Just dump it
best you can.

04:22.693 --> 04:24.493
It's a court appointment.

04:25.826 --> 04:28.060
HATCHER: Six months suspended
is how it should go.

04:28.093 --> 04:29.560
Right.

04:29.593 --> 04:30.760
Have you got the pleadings?

04:30.793 --> 04:32.760
Any pretrial motions,
suppression hearings?

04:32.793 --> 04:34.159
Bobby met the guy
at arraignment.

04:34.193 --> 04:35.493
A trial date was set.

04:36.659 --> 04:37.759
You're up to speed.

04:38.793 --> 04:39.760
Got it.

04:48.426 --> 04:50.193
(sighs)

04:50.226 --> 04:51.893
He's making us wait
on purpose.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.160
He's having his fun.

04:55.193 --> 04:56.426
How long has it been?

04:56.460 --> 04:57.326
Fifty minutes.

04:57.360 --> 04:58.560
I'm giving him 10 more.

04:58.593 --> 05:00.000
We can't leave.

05:00.033 --> 05:01.633
I'm not sitting here all day,
Bobby.

05:01.666 --> 05:02.833
He'll be here.

05:03.500 --> 05:04.733
(door knob clicks)

05:09.300 --> 05:10.300
Gentlemen...

05:11.833 --> 05:13.633
(clears throat)

05:13.666 --> 05:14.700
I'm sorry to keep you.

05:17.333 --> 05:18.333
(sighs)

05:18.366 --> 05:20.900
I've, uh reviewed
your plea offer.

05:22.566 --> 05:23.433
It's rejected.

05:24.933 --> 05:25.600
What?

05:27.300 --> 05:28.766
Why?

05:29.533 --> 05:30.700
Why?

05:31.966 --> 05:34.733
Because your wife
committed first-degree murder.

05:38.766 --> 05:40.633
The only thing
that would impel me

05:40.666 --> 05:42.133
to plead down
to manslaughter

05:42.166 --> 05:43.766
would be
a perceived difficulty

05:43.800 --> 05:46.200
of prevailing at trial.

05:46.233 --> 05:48.466
I don't have such
a perception.

05:48.500 --> 05:51.033
I feel confident the jury
will reach the right result,

05:51.066 --> 05:52.600
as they did the first time.

05:53.866 --> 05:56.633
Accordingly,
your offer is rejected.

05:59.333 --> 06:00.740
Anything else to discuss?

06:01.173 --> 06:02.973
This was a manslaughter.

06:03.006 --> 06:04.240
You know it was a manslaughter

06:04.273 --> 06:05.940
and you're an officer
of the court.

06:05.973 --> 06:07.073
Thank you, Eugene.

06:07.106 --> 06:09.306
I always value outside input.

06:09.340 --> 06:10.806
Would you like to know
the particular value

06:10.840 --> 06:12.140
I place on yours?

06:12.173 --> 06:13.806
Are you cocky, Kenneth?

06:13.840 --> 06:16.406
Maybe you need to review
your track record against us.

06:16.440 --> 06:17.340
Haven't got the time,

06:17.373 --> 06:18.373
but I'll tell you what,

06:18.406 --> 06:20.106
I'll go over
the last matchup.

06:23.973 --> 06:25.740
You gonna take
the stand again, Bobby?

06:28.573 --> 06:30.440
That went real well,
didn't it?

06:32.740 --> 06:35.773
By the way,
who's gonna try it this time?

06:35.806 --> 06:37.540
Jimmy?

06:37.573 --> 06:38.706
Eugene?

06:38.740 --> 06:41.206
Ellenor was a good choice,
wasn't she?

06:43.340 --> 06:45.040
Have a good day, boys.

06:53.273 --> 06:54.206
What do we do now?

06:54.240 --> 06:55.273
DONNELL:
We prepare to try it.

06:55.306 --> 06:56.873
Jimmy, you and Bec,
I want research.

06:56.906 --> 06:59.273
See if there's any grounds
to suppress Lindsay's testimony.

06:59.306 --> 07:00.313
How?
DONNELL: I don't know.

07:00.346 --> 07:01.446
Go through the transcript.

07:01.480 --> 07:03.113
See if Walsh made
any allusion up front

07:03.146 --> 07:05.246
to Lindsay not talking
to the police.

07:05.280 --> 07:07.446
Maybe we can argue
she was coerced

07:07.480 --> 07:08.846
into testifying by the D. A.

07:08.880 --> 07:11.346
Bobby...
DONNELL: It's worth a shot.

07:11.746 --> 07:13.413
Ellenor, the victim
was seeing a shrink.

07:13.446 --> 07:15.846
Maybe he told the shrink
he planned to kill Lindsay.

07:15.880 --> 07:17.113
Privilege doesn't survive
the patient.

07:17.146 --> 07:19.280
I interviewed his therapist.
It was a dead end.

07:19.313 --> 07:20.180
DONNELL: Well,
subpoena his records.

07:20.213 --> 07:21.980
Maybe there's something
in his note.

07:22.013 --> 07:23.780
FRUTT: Bobby, the victim's
state of mind isn't relevant.

07:23.813 --> 07:25.113
You're thinking like a loser!

07:29.146 --> 07:30.313
I'm sorry.

07:30.346 --> 07:31.213
I didn't mean that.

07:32.580 --> 07:33.946
Look, obviously,

07:33.980 --> 07:35.080
whatever we come up with

07:35.113 --> 07:36.946
is going to be desperate.

07:39.313 --> 07:40.980
Eugene?

07:41.013 --> 07:42.513
I'm interviewing
potential experts

07:42.546 --> 07:43.913
on post-traumatic stress.

07:43.946 --> 07:45.480
Hopefully,
we can find somebody

07:45.513 --> 07:46.746
to label her insane.

07:46.780 --> 07:47.480
DONNELL: Good. Okay.

07:47.513 --> 07:48.413
We all have work to do.

07:48.446 --> 07:49.580
Let's go at it.

07:49.613 --> 07:50.646
Ellenor...

07:50.680 --> 07:52.813
can I talk to you a second?

07:52.846 --> 07:55.713
Actually, I think I better
get going on this research.

08:01.453 --> 08:03.386
I was pissing.

08:03.420 --> 08:05.120
Pardon my Frenchiness,
but that's what I was doing.

08:05.153 --> 08:06.920
I had a bladder infection.

08:06.953 --> 08:09.020
STRINGER: And you didn't use
the restroom because?

08:09.053 --> 08:11.586
I couldn't get there
fast enough.

08:11.620 --> 08:14.720
I swear I was not flashing
those girls,

08:14.753 --> 08:16.520
though they totally wanted it.

08:16.553 --> 08:17.820
Jamie Stringer?

08:17.853 --> 08:18.786
Yes, hello.

08:18.820 --> 08:20.786
I wasn't wanking.

08:20.820 --> 08:22.086
Yes.

08:22.120 --> 08:23.153
(clears throat)

08:23.186 --> 08:23.886
ALEXANDER: Can we talk?

08:23.920 --> 08:25.020
Sure.

08:27.320 --> 08:29.086
Three months, we're happy.

08:29.120 --> 08:31.586
How about six months,
but we suspend it?

08:31.620 --> 08:32.520
Can't.

08:32.553 --> 08:33.852
Third offense.

08:33.885 --> 08:35.753
With a conviction,
he could get a year.

08:35.785 --> 08:36.686
Does he know that?

08:36.720 --> 08:38.120
He claims he's innocent.

08:38.153 --> 08:39.120
Yeah, I just heard,

08:39.153 --> 08:41.320
and his eloquence
gives me pause.

08:41.352 --> 08:43.285
But I'm still holding out
for time.

08:43.919 --> 08:45.720
Then I think we have a trial.

08:49.120 --> 08:50.820
HATCHER: You were supposed
to dump it.

08:50.853 --> 08:51.886
What could I do?

08:51.920 --> 08:53.986
The client wanted his day
in court.

08:54.020 --> 08:56.053
HATCHER: He's gonna get his day
in prison, Jamie,

08:56.086 --> 08:57.120
lots of them.

08:57.153 --> 08:58.753
He says he's innocent.

08:58.786 --> 09:00.726
They all say they're innocent.

09:00.760 --> 09:02.293
Bobby's expecting you
to be freed up

09:02.326 --> 09:03.626
to work on Lindsay's case.

09:03.660 --> 09:05.593
It should be a one-day trial.

09:05.626 --> 09:06.593
(scoffs)

09:06.626 --> 09:08.260
You were supposed to dump it.

09:14.426 --> 09:16.593
Buy a girl a drink?

09:16.626 --> 09:17.960
(sighs)

09:17.993 --> 09:20.593
Come on, Helen,
they're your friends.

09:20.626 --> 09:21.993
Okay.

09:22.026 --> 09:24.593
let's discount
my friendship,

09:24.626 --> 09:26.126
your hatred,

09:26.160 --> 09:29.793
and just objectively look
at what Lindsay did.

09:29.826 --> 09:31.260
It's manslaughter.

09:31.293 --> 09:32.793
(chuckles)

09:32.826 --> 09:34.360
Your opinion, not mine.

09:34.393 --> 09:35.593
Come on.

09:37.426 --> 09:39.593
A woman vows to kill somebody,

09:39.626 --> 09:41.726
shoots an unarmed man
after saying,

09:41.760 --> 09:43.260
"See you in heaven."

09:43.293 --> 09:44.426
That's not a murder?

09:45.826 --> 09:47.493
I'm supposed to let her
get away with this

09:47.526 --> 09:48.993
because she has a friend
in our office?

09:49.026 --> 09:51.626
Nobody's saying
she should get away with it.

09:51.660 --> 09:52.626
(sighs)

09:52.660 --> 09:54.960
Did you read their brief
to the S. J. C., Helen?

09:54.993 --> 09:56.593
It wasn't about the law

09:56.626 --> 09:57.760
or the merits,

09:57.793 --> 10:00.266
as much as it was
an attack on me.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.600
In open court,
they attacked me.

10:02.633 --> 10:04.500
Because prosecutorial
misconduct

10:04.533 --> 10:06.233
was their best
legal strategy,

10:06.266 --> 10:07.400
and you know that.

10:07.433 --> 10:09.466
You know what I know?

10:09.500 --> 10:10.766
Twenty-five years ago,

10:10.800 --> 10:12.200
there could have been
a defense attorney

10:12.233 --> 10:14.166
on that stool
drinking with me.

10:14.200 --> 10:16.233
End of the day,
we were friends.

10:16.266 --> 10:19.066
And you know why?

10:19.100 --> 10:21.100
We were all in it
for the same thing.

10:21.133 --> 10:23.933
We were players
in a justice system.

10:24.600 --> 10:26.700
Fair representation.

10:27.833 --> 10:31.166
Somewhere along the line,
it changed.

10:31.200 --> 10:33.900
The goal for defense attorneys
became to beat it,

10:33.933 --> 10:34.900
beat the rap.

10:34.933 --> 10:36.000
"We can beat it."

10:37.266 --> 10:38.800
Let me tell you something,
Helen.

10:38.833 --> 10:40.100
Lawyers like Bobby Donnell,

10:40.133 --> 10:42.766
they've destroyed
the criminal justice system.

10:42.800 --> 10:44.233
They hide the truth.

10:44.266 --> 10:45.300
They intimidate witnesses.

10:45.333 --> 10:48.066
They offer lies in court.

10:48.100 --> 10:50.000
And in the process,

10:50.033 --> 10:52.966
they've destroyed
people like me,

10:53.000 --> 10:55.333
and that's why I hate them.

10:55.366 --> 10:58.333
In order to have half a chance
at getting a conviction,

10:58.366 --> 11:01.906
I have to compete
with the same dirty tactics.

11:01.940 --> 11:04.540
They've sapped us
of any dignity,

11:04.573 --> 11:07.506
along with the courts,
and I hate them for it.

11:09.406 --> 11:11.173
We no longer go to work

11:11.206 --> 11:14.473
at an honorable place, Helen.

11:14.506 --> 11:16.540
And you should hate them, too.

11:17.673 --> 11:18.606
Okay. Well,

11:18.640 --> 11:21.206
without disagreeing
with all that,

11:21.240 --> 11:23.206
and I don't,

11:23.240 --> 11:25.940
my point is the facts
of this case

11:25.973 --> 11:28.406
suggest manslaughter,
not murder one.

11:28.440 --> 11:30.006
You didn't hear a thing
I just said.

11:30.040 --> 11:31.573
Yes, I did, but you--

11:31.606 --> 11:32.806
You know why Lindsay
pumped that guy

11:32.840 --> 11:34.206
with three bullets?

11:34.240 --> 11:36.973
For the same reason
my dog licks his balls,

11:37.006 --> 11:38.273
because he can.

11:39.073 --> 11:42.140
She's gotten so many guys off
for crimes she knows they did,

11:42.173 --> 11:44.373
she figured
she'd easily get herself off.

11:44.406 --> 11:46.106
She'd be able to beat it.

11:46.640 --> 11:49.640
And I saw the same
cocksure look on their faces

11:49.673 --> 11:50.773
in the courtroom, Helen.

11:50.806 --> 11:52.606
They can beat it.

11:53.640 --> 11:55.873
Well, they're not
gonna beat it.

11:55.906 --> 11:57.506
They may have the resources

11:57.540 --> 12:00.446
to swing 7 S. O. B. s
on the Supreme Court,

12:00.480 --> 12:02.446
but eventually,
it comes back to the jury.

12:02.480 --> 12:03.846
It comes back to me,

12:03.880 --> 12:06.746
and I'm telling you
they're not gonna beat it.

12:13.280 --> 12:15.346
How did you get like this?

12:17.646 --> 12:19.746
Last week,
you lied to a suspect

12:19.780 --> 12:22.680
in order to trick her
into a confession,

12:22.713 --> 12:24.846
a false confession.

12:27.746 --> 12:30.146
There's a reason I'm hard
to look at, Helen.

12:30.180 --> 12:31.746
You see yourself.

13:04.786 --> 13:06.320
DONNELL: After midnight.

13:08.153 --> 13:09.886
I'm just about to go home.

13:18.553 --> 13:20.220
(sighs)

13:22.453 --> 13:24.786
What I said...

13:24.820 --> 13:27.020
about you
thinking like a loser,

13:30.853 --> 13:33.153
that just came out
of frustration.

13:35.020 --> 13:37.320
You have to know
I don't blame you.

13:38.786 --> 13:40.753
I blame myself, Bobby.

13:42.753 --> 13:44.920
Come on...

13:44.953 --> 13:45.786
we win trials.

13:45.820 --> 13:46.853
We lose trials.

13:46.886 --> 13:47.620
We excel.

13:47.653 --> 13:48.686
We don't excel.

13:48.720 --> 13:50.353
Sometimes...
This...

13:51.686 --> 13:52.986
was Lindsay.

14:17.726 --> 14:18.760
DINA: We were waiting
for our bus,

14:18.793 --> 14:19.993
and then we, like, saw him.

14:20.026 --> 14:21.126
Him being?

14:21.160 --> 14:22.260
Pervman.

14:22.293 --> 14:23.393
Objection.

14:23.426 --> 14:24.493
Sustained.

14:24.526 --> 14:25.626
You saw the defendant?

14:25.660 --> 14:26.393
DINA: Yes.

14:26.426 --> 14:27.826
And what was he doing?

14:27.860 --> 14:29.560
First, we saw him stare at us.

14:29.593 --> 14:31.093
Then we all
kind of commented on it,

14:31.126 --> 14:33.393
because we thought he was,
like, a total creep-o.

14:33.426 --> 14:34.693
Am I allowed to say that?

14:35.260 --> 14:36.393
Then what?

14:36.426 --> 14:38.293
Then, about 30 seconds later,

14:38.326 --> 14:40.060
I turn around,
and he's got his fly down,

14:40.093 --> 14:42.026
and he's holding out
his big unit,

14:42.526 --> 14:44.526
offering it to us
like it's a Krispy Kreme.

14:44.560 --> 14:46.060
It was totally gross.

14:46.093 --> 14:49.560
ALEXANDER: And could you see
what he was doing with his--

14:49.593 --> 14:51.960
He was just kind
of wagging it for us,

14:51.993 --> 14:53.360
like we were dogs or something,

14:53.393 --> 14:54.926
and we wanted to play fetch.

14:54.960 --> 14:57.226
It was totally foul.

14:57.960 --> 14:59.093
Thank you, Dina.

15:02.533 --> 15:04.133
STRINGER: It must have been
kind of shocking

15:04.166 --> 15:05.966
to see what you refer to as,

15:06.000 --> 15:06.933
"The big unit."

15:06.966 --> 15:08.733
Yeah, it freaked us all out.

15:08.766 --> 15:11.566
And how far away from you
was Mr. Pender standing?

15:11.600 --> 15:13.266
He was on the other side
of the street.

15:13.300 --> 15:14.333
Was it a busy street?

15:14.366 --> 15:15.233
Do you remember?

15:15.266 --> 15:17.233
Fairly busy.
It was around rush hour.

15:17.266 --> 15:19.166
Lots of cars and so forth?

15:19.200 --> 15:20.800
DINA: I guess.

15:20.833 --> 15:23.300
And were you and the girls
interested in looking at him?

15:23.933 --> 15:25.500
Hello? No.

15:25.533 --> 15:28.000
Well, how long
did you look at him?

15:28.033 --> 15:29.600
A few seconds at most.

15:29.633 --> 15:31.100
I'm so sure.

15:31.900 --> 15:33.466
Okay. Thanks, Dina.

15:41.766 --> 15:42.900
(clears throat)

15:42.933 --> 15:45.066
(phone ringing)

15:45.100 --> 15:46.933
Donnell, Young, Dole,
Frutt, and Hatcher.

15:48.700 --> 15:50.266
What? Didn't you hear?

15:51.133 --> 15:52.400
Oh, no, I'm sorry, sir.

15:52.433 --> 15:53.933
We can't do that today.

15:53.966 --> 15:55.666
Perhaps another time?

15:55.700 --> 15:57.500
Okay, yeah, great.
Thanks for your call.

15:58.166 --> 15:59.573
Who was that?

15:59.606 --> 16:01.773
HATCHER: Another whacko angry
over the reversal.

16:01.806 --> 16:03.806
He asked if we could all
shrivel up and die.

16:04.706 --> 16:06.773
We've been getting
a lot of hate mail, too.

16:06.806 --> 16:08.273
People who think the conviction

16:08.306 --> 16:10.140
shouldn't have been overturned.

16:13.006 --> 16:13.773
Ellenor.

16:13.806 --> 16:14.873
FRUTT: What?

16:14.906 --> 16:16.873
This just came
through the fax.

16:21.440 --> 16:23.373
Who sent this?

16:23.406 --> 16:25.073
HATCHER: I don't know.

16:25.106 --> 16:28.706
"Likely moving forward
at the time of impact."

16:28.740 --> 16:30.006
Their witness testified

16:30.040 --> 16:31.606
the victim
was likely stationary.

16:31.640 --> 16:34.106
Look, I've got the transcript.
I underlined it.

16:34.140 --> 16:35.973
This isn't the same analyst
who testified.

16:36.006 --> 16:37.973
FRUTT: I called the lab.
It was a junior guy.

16:38.006 --> 16:39.740
It's obviously
a preliminary report,

16:39.773 --> 16:41.973
and probably Walsh
had them redo it.

16:42.006 --> 16:43.840
The point is,
we never got it,

16:43.873 --> 16:45.073
and it's exculpatory.

16:45.106 --> 16:47.273
Eugene, talk to this
Mr. Hallbrenner.

16:47.306 --> 16:50.173
Ellenor, I want you
to start preparing a Rule 30.

16:50.840 --> 16:51.806
Who sent us this?

16:51.840 --> 16:52.573
I don't know.

16:52.606 --> 16:53.973
Lucy found it in the fax.

17:00.080 --> 17:01.246
(door opens)

17:02.446 --> 17:03.246
Mr. Hallbrenner?

17:03.280 --> 17:04.445
Uh-hmm?

17:07.146 --> 17:08.613
Hi, I'm Eugene Young.

17:08.646 --> 17:09.880
I represent Lindsay Dole.

17:09.913 --> 17:11.546
I believe
you investigated the murder

17:11.579 --> 17:12.780
for which she was charged.

17:12.813 --> 17:14.280
Who told you that?

17:14.880 --> 17:16.280
I'm not sure. Why?

17:16.313 --> 17:17.846
Is it supposed to be a secret?

17:17.880 --> 17:19.246
Mr. Young, I'm quite busy.

17:19.280 --> 17:20.646
If you'd like to make
an appointment,

17:20.680 --> 17:23.146
I'd be happy to give you
whatever information I can.

17:23.945 --> 17:25.613
I'm looking more
for you to give me

17:25.646 --> 17:27.613
the information you can't.

17:27.646 --> 17:29.513
Are we being cryptic now?

17:29.546 --> 17:31.046
I'm sorry.

17:31.080 --> 17:32.380
Let me be more clear.

17:34.380 --> 17:35.613
Is this your report?

17:38.580 --> 17:39.313
Where'd you get this?

17:39.346 --> 17:40.846
The point is I have it.

17:40.880 --> 17:41.880
Did you write it?

17:42.313 --> 17:43.180
Yes.

17:43.213 --> 17:44.513
Who'd you give it to?

17:44.546 --> 17:46.846
I'm afraid you'll have to make
an appointment, Mr. Young.

17:46.880 --> 17:49.080
Did Kenneth Walsh
get this report?

17:49.113 --> 17:50.613
I don't know.
I'm very busy.

17:50.646 --> 17:52.246
You'll have to excuse me.

17:58.080 --> 18:00.120
I direct the court's
attention to Rule 30

18:00.153 --> 18:01.886
of the Massachusetts
Criminal Law Code,

18:01.920 --> 18:03.720
which calls for a dismissal,

18:03.753 --> 18:05.520
with prejudice,
of the indictment

18:05.553 --> 18:07.086
where there is egregious

18:07.120 --> 18:08.386
prosecutorial misconduct.

18:08.420 --> 18:09.720
WALSH: There's been
no misconduct.

18:09.753 --> 18:11.353
Ms. Frutt is simply--
FRUTT: I direct

18:11.386 --> 18:12.886
the court's attention
to exhibit one,

18:12.920 --> 18:13.853
attached to our motion.

18:13.886 --> 18:15.120
WALSH: It's kitchen sink time.

18:15.153 --> 18:17.120
FRUTT: This isn't
a kitchen sink, Mr. Walsh.

18:17.153 --> 18:18.886
It is an internal memorandum,

18:18.920 --> 18:21.786
which says the victim
was likely moving

18:21.820 --> 18:23.586
towards Lindsay Dole.

18:23.620 --> 18:25.053
WALSH: First of all,
that memorandum is incorrect.

18:25.086 --> 18:27.486
Second, it's work product.
It's exculpatory.

18:27.520 --> 18:29.286
WALSH: It's part
of our internal investigation.

18:29.320 --> 18:30.220
It's work product.

18:30.253 --> 18:31.920
We have many lab analysts.

18:31.953 --> 18:33.486
The report says,

18:33.520 --> 18:36.953
"The victim was likely
moving forward."

18:36.986 --> 18:38.820
WALSH: But that was not
the final conclusion

18:38.853 --> 18:39.953
of our analyst.

18:39.986 --> 18:41.820
This is not a fifth grade
math test.

18:41.853 --> 18:43.253
We don't have to show you
our work.

18:43.286 --> 18:44.786
We have to give you
our findings.

18:44.820 --> 18:46.286
That's our obligation
under the rules,

18:46.320 --> 18:47.553
and that's what we did.

18:47.586 --> 18:48.720
Your Honor,
we would like to conduct

18:48.753 --> 18:50.520
an evidentiary hearing.
Of course you would.

18:50.553 --> 18:52.453
You'd like to drag this out
into perpetuity.

18:52.486 --> 18:53.520
But the law does not allow--

18:53.553 --> 18:55.286
FRUTT:
This was exculpatory evidence.

18:55.320 --> 18:57.020
I object to his smugness.

18:57.053 --> 18:59.460
He had a duty
to turn it over to us.

18:59.493 --> 19:01.193
Not if it's work product.

19:01.226 --> 19:02.093
At a minimum,

19:02.126 --> 19:04.193
we are entitled to a hearing.

19:04.226 --> 19:05.693
WEST: Who do you want
to question?

19:05.726 --> 19:07.126
FRUTT: The analyst
who authored the report.

19:07.160 --> 19:08.460
You will be stunned to learn

19:08.493 --> 19:10.460
he isn't volunteering
his candor.

19:10.493 --> 19:11.760
WALSH: Of course not.
He's probably worried

19:11.793 --> 19:13.526
you'll plan "B" him
and accuse him of murder.

19:13.560 --> 19:14.626
WEST: All right.

19:16.260 --> 19:18.326
I'm gonna let you question
this analyst.

19:18.360 --> 19:19.926
But turn it into a circus,

19:19.960 --> 19:21.760
and I'll shut it down.

19:22.226 --> 19:23.660
We're going to have a hearing?

19:24.593 --> 19:25.693
Yes, we are, Mr. Walsh.

19:25.726 --> 19:26.760
Would that be all right?

19:29.226 --> 19:31.060
Your Honor, since evidence
will be presented,

19:31.093 --> 19:32.593
we'd like Ms. Dole
to be here.

19:32.626 --> 19:34.293
10:00 tomorrow morning.

19:34.326 --> 19:35.526
(gavel bangs)

19:39.360 --> 19:41.060
(phone ringing)

19:48.426 --> 19:50.293
You gave them that report.

19:55.193 --> 19:57.460
Why didn't you at least
have the integrity

19:57.493 --> 19:59.100
to be up-front about it?

20:01.266 --> 20:03.133
Is that your style,

20:03.166 --> 20:04.700
to be up-front?

20:06.600 --> 20:09.133
The reason I did it anonymously,

20:10.333 --> 20:12.700
I'm one of your lieutenants

20:12.733 --> 20:14.566
not withstanding
a few skirmishes,

20:14.600 --> 20:16.900
a pretty loyal lieutenant.

20:16.933 --> 20:18.600
What would become
of your reputation,

20:18.633 --> 20:21.033
not to mention your credibility
in the courtroom,

20:21.066 --> 20:23.166
if one of your minions
betrayed you?

20:25.333 --> 20:27.966
This wasn't about
attacking you.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.333
It was about
giving defense a document

20:30.366 --> 20:31.633
they're entitled to have.

20:31.666 --> 20:34.733
It's about following
the rules, Ken.

20:35.066 --> 20:38.900
That's where I locate
my integrity in all of this.

20:41.600 --> 20:42.800
GAMBLE: Look,

20:42.833 --> 20:44.833
before you add me
to a list of people

20:44.866 --> 20:46.966
that are out to get you,

20:47.000 --> 20:48.366
when I started here,

20:48.400 --> 20:50.233
I wanted to be you.

20:52.733 --> 20:55.433
That's how much
I admired you.

20:55.466 --> 20:58.300
(music playing)

21:24.680 --> 21:27.180
DONNELL: I have never seen
a person demolish a hamburger

21:27.213 --> 21:28.446
at 9:30 in the morning.

21:28.480 --> 21:30.780
Once you do time,
you'll understand.

21:33.780 --> 21:35.713
Hey.
Hey.

21:35.746 --> 21:37.146
How are you?

21:37.180 --> 21:38.613
I'm good.

21:41.346 --> 21:42.946
Pardon the onions.

21:42.980 --> 21:44.913
Hi, Bec.
Hi.

21:44.946 --> 21:47.213
Thanks for coming, Eugene.

21:48.613 --> 21:49.346
You holding up?

21:49.380 --> 21:50.980
Yeah.

21:51.013 --> 21:52.280
Getting out
even for a day.

21:55.046 --> 21:55.746
We ready?

21:56.913 --> 21:58.080
All set.

21:58.113 --> 21:59.180
Eugene's taking the witness.

21:59.213 --> 22:00.286
I'll argue after.

22:03.820 --> 22:05.753
You ready?

22:05.786 --> 22:07.220
Yes.

22:10.886 --> 22:12.253
PENDER: I saw them
standing there,

22:12.286 --> 22:13.453
waiting for a bus
or something.

22:13.986 --> 22:15.820
And what were you doing
at the time?

22:15.853 --> 22:18.320
I was looking
for a bookstore.

22:18.353 --> 22:20.086
I'm a voracious reader.

22:20.953 --> 22:22.420
You were looking
for a bookstore?

22:22.453 --> 22:23.420
PENDER: Yes.
Yes, and, uh,

22:23.453 --> 22:26.353
and then I noticed them.

22:26.386 --> 22:28.420
They were all
smoking cigarettes.

22:29.120 --> 22:30.753
(scoffs) It was disgusting.

22:30.786 --> 22:32.620
Cigarettes are a leading cause

22:32.653 --> 22:35.320
of cancer and death.

22:35.353 --> 22:37.153
To see young people
killing themselves,

22:37.186 --> 22:38.253
I couldn't stand it.

22:41.020 --> 22:42.820
Did you have to go
to the bathroom?

22:42.853 --> 22:45.520
PENDER: No, no, no,
I exposed my swordsman

22:45.553 --> 22:47.086
because I had written on it,

22:47.120 --> 22:48.853
"Smoking causes death."

22:49.420 --> 22:51.720
You had that written on...

22:51.753 --> 22:53.786
PENDER: Well,
it's no secret sex sells.

22:53.820 --> 22:55.753
I mean, advertisers use it
all the time.

22:56.320 --> 22:58.620
I just figured the best way
to put my message across

22:58.653 --> 22:59.960
was to put it on my penis.

23:01.693 --> 23:03.260
Thank you, Mr. Pender.

23:07.460 --> 23:09.626
You told the police
you were urinating.

23:09.660 --> 23:12.160
Well, I didn't wanna tip
my defense.

23:12.626 --> 23:13.960
ALEXANDER: I see.

23:13.993 --> 23:16.160
You were arrested twice before

23:16.193 --> 23:18.593
for exposing yourself,
were you not, Mr. Pender?

23:18.626 --> 23:20.426
PENDER: Yes, yes.
Both examples

23:20.460 --> 23:22.160
of blaming the messenger.

23:22.193 --> 23:23.460
Oh, you had things
written on your penis

23:23.493 --> 23:25.426
on those occasions?
Yes, I did.

23:25.460 --> 23:27.460
The first time,

23:27.493 --> 23:29.660
I was protesting world hunger.

23:29.693 --> 23:31.293
And the second one

23:31.326 --> 23:33.160
was during the election.

23:33.193 --> 23:33.960
It said, "Gore."

23:35.426 --> 23:37.526
I think the police
mistook it for a verb.

23:39.026 --> 23:40.926
You humiliated me!

23:40.960 --> 23:43.260
Hey, it's my life. I'm the one
looking at jail here.

23:43.293 --> 23:45.160
Well, why didn't you tell me
what you planned to say?

23:45.193 --> 23:46.226
PENDER: I didn't know.
I just decided

23:46.260 --> 23:47.593
to call an audible
on the line.

23:47.626 --> 23:49.060
You know,
the thought of you arguing

23:49.093 --> 23:50.626
that it was a bad traffic day

23:50.660 --> 23:52.326
didn't make me squiggle
with confidence.

23:52.360 --> 23:54.026
You listen to me,

23:54.060 --> 23:56.193
I graduated high school
in three years.

23:56.226 --> 23:57.726
I graduated Yale with honors.

23:57.760 --> 23:59.126
I made law review at Harvard.

23:59.160 --> 24:01.266
I excel at everything I do.

24:01.300 --> 24:02.833
I'm even pretty.

24:02.866 --> 24:04.633
I will not have you
wreck my law career

24:04.666 --> 24:06.033
by making me look bad
in court.

24:06.066 --> 24:07.200
I'm supposed
to get up in court now

24:07.233 --> 24:09.500
and blame it on big tobacco?
You suck!

24:10.700 --> 24:12.566
I'm not bringing you any more
of my business.

24:14.666 --> 24:16.433
We disagree internally
all the time.

24:16.466 --> 24:17.800
It's called debate.
YOUNG: Yes,

24:17.833 --> 24:19.900
but your expert opinion

24:19.933 --> 24:22.633
was that Lawrence O'Malley
was likely moving forward.

24:22.666 --> 24:24.366
That was my initial conclusion.

24:24.400 --> 24:26.500
Upon consultation
with other analysts,

24:26.533 --> 24:27.700
I changed my position.

24:27.733 --> 24:29.333
He was likely stationary.

24:29.366 --> 24:31.400
YOUNG: Did you issue
another report?

24:31.433 --> 24:32.266
HALLBRENNER: No.

24:32.300 --> 24:33.700
YOUNG: In fact,

24:33.733 --> 24:36.700
this letter is your only
recorded finding,

24:36.733 --> 24:39.166
isn't it, Mr. Hallbrenner?
HALLBRENNER: Yes.

24:39.200 --> 24:41.533
YOUNG: So, when you changed
your position,

24:41.566 --> 24:43.266
you didn't issue a new report.

24:43.300 --> 24:45.600
No, the case was taken over
by my supervisor.

24:45.633 --> 24:46.766
YOUNG: Your supervisor?

24:46.800 --> 24:49.166
That would be Joshua Illitch?
Correct.

24:49.200 --> 24:50.666
So he took over the case,

24:50.700 --> 24:52.633
issued another report
saying that the victim

24:52.666 --> 24:54.933
was likely stationary?
HALLBRENNER: Correct.

24:54.966 --> 24:57.266
YOUNG: And it was Mr. Illitch
who testified at trial?

24:57.300 --> 24:58.300
Correct.

24:58.333 --> 25:00.273
While they kept you
in a back room out of sight?

25:00.306 --> 25:02.440
Objection.
Sustained.

25:02.473 --> 25:05.073
Mr. Hallbrenner,
after you issued your report,

25:05.106 --> 25:07.406
did anybody ask you
to change your mind?

25:09.373 --> 25:11.506
People argue
their points of view

25:11.540 --> 25:14.473
in order to get people
to change their minds.

25:14.506 --> 25:15.773
That happened here.

25:15.806 --> 25:17.506
Nobody forced me.

25:17.540 --> 25:19.806
People argued
their points of view,

25:19.840 --> 25:21.340
you mean other analysts?

25:21.373 --> 25:22.273
Correct.

25:22.906 --> 25:24.340
Did Mr. Walsh

25:24.373 --> 25:26.506
ever argue
his point of view to you?

25:28.606 --> 25:31.273
Yes.
YOUNG: So, he read your report.

25:31.306 --> 25:33.340
HALLBRENNER: Yes.
And he disagreed with it?

25:33.373 --> 25:34.373
Yes.

25:34.406 --> 25:36.306
Did he ask you to alter
your findings?

25:36.340 --> 25:38.806
He disagreed with my report.

25:38.840 --> 25:40.340
YOUNG: That wasn't my question,
Mr. Hallbrenner.

25:40.373 --> 25:43.073
Did he ask you

25:43.106 --> 25:45.206
to alter your findings?

25:46.206 --> 25:46.873
Yes.

25:48.740 --> 25:50.406
YOUNG: And your response?

25:50.440 --> 25:51.806
I refused.

25:51.840 --> 25:53.706
And at that point,

25:53.740 --> 25:55.573
your supervisor
took over the case,

25:55.606 --> 25:57.973
and a subsequent report
was issued

25:58.006 --> 26:00.313
contradicting your findings.

26:00.346 --> 26:01.780
Is that what happened,
Mr. Hallbrenner?

26:02.580 --> 26:03.946
Something like that.

26:05.680 --> 26:07.980
YOUNG: Thank you,
Mr. Hallbrenner.

26:11.713 --> 26:13.446
WALSH: (clears throat)

26:13.480 --> 26:14.780
You said I asked you

26:14.813 --> 26:17.146
to reissue a report.

26:17.180 --> 26:18.180
Did I force you to?

26:18.213 --> 26:19.380
No.

26:19.413 --> 26:20.480
And was I the only one

26:20.513 --> 26:22.146
who disagreed
with your findings?

26:22.180 --> 26:23.313
No.

26:23.346 --> 26:24.413
WALSH: Other analysts

26:24.446 --> 26:26.313
looked at the same
evidence you did

26:26.346 --> 26:27.980
and reached
a different conclusion.

26:28.013 --> 26:28.980
Am I right?

26:29.013 --> 26:30.213
You are.

26:30.246 --> 26:31.380
In fact,

26:31.413 --> 26:34.380
three analysts senior to you,

26:34.413 --> 26:35.446
isn't that right?

26:35.480 --> 26:36.546
It is.

26:36.580 --> 26:38.380
More experienced analysts?

26:38.413 --> 26:39.446
Yes.

26:39.480 --> 26:42.080
In fact, the consensus
of your department

26:42.113 --> 26:43.980
was that Mr. O'Malley
was likely standing

26:44.013 --> 26:45.413
in a stationary position

26:45.446 --> 26:47.046
at the time Lindsay Dole

26:47.080 --> 26:48.680
shot him three times.

26:48.713 --> 26:50.313
Wasn't that the consensus?

26:50.346 --> 26:52.113
Yes.

26:52.146 --> 26:53.713
Thank you, Mr. Hallbrenner.

26:53.746 --> 26:55.146
That's all I have.

26:56.113 --> 26:57.313
WEST: The witness may step down.

26:57.813 --> 27:00.520
Mr. Walsh, if you have anything
to say, I'll hear it now.

27:00.553 --> 27:02.953
Then I'll give defense an
opportunity to sum up, as well.

27:02.986 --> 27:04.620
WALSH: Thank you, Your Honor.

27:05.353 --> 27:07.420
As I said earlier,

27:07.453 --> 27:09.220
this was a preliminary

27:09.253 --> 27:10.786
internal memorandum,

27:10.820 --> 27:12.853
which clearly falls
within the definition

27:12.886 --> 27:14.153
of work product.

27:14.620 --> 27:16.886
It wasn't evidence.

27:16.920 --> 27:18.753
Certainly,
we are required to share

27:18.786 --> 27:20.286
with defense our findings,

27:20.320 --> 27:22.586
but not our thinking
or consultations

27:22.620 --> 27:24.220
which lead to those findings.

27:24.786 --> 27:26.453
Mr. Hallbrenner's report

27:26.486 --> 27:29.153
represents a minority
point of view,

27:29.186 --> 27:30.886
which we deemed neither accurate

27:30.920 --> 27:33.053
nor relevant to our prosecution.

27:33.453 --> 27:34.853
It was not relied on.

27:34.886 --> 27:37.053
It was not a factor.

27:37.086 --> 27:39.553
Moreover, Your Honor,
even should you find

27:39.586 --> 27:40.486
that we should have turned

27:40.520 --> 27:42.653
this preliminary report over,

27:42.686 --> 27:43.553
what's the harm?

27:43.586 --> 27:45.786
This case never turned

27:45.820 --> 27:48.020
on whether or not
the victim was moving forward.

27:48.453 --> 27:49.920
Lindsay Dole never maintained

27:49.953 --> 27:51.853
the victim
was coming towards her.

27:51.886 --> 27:53.186
In their testimony,

27:53.220 --> 27:54.353
in their statements
to the police,

27:54.386 --> 27:56.520
Lindsay and Bobby Donnell
never even suggested

27:56.553 --> 27:58.186
that the victim
was coming towards her.

27:58.753 --> 28:01.126
They didn't argue self-defense.

28:01.160 --> 28:02.393
They alleged

28:02.426 --> 28:04.926
battered-woman syndrome.

28:04.960 --> 28:06.960
The victim's position
or forward movement

28:06.993 --> 28:08.393
has nothing to do
with that defense,

28:08.426 --> 28:10.760
nor did they
ever suggest it did.

28:11.526 --> 28:12.793
What we have here

28:12.826 --> 28:15.126
is a desperate ploy
from a convicted murderer

28:15.160 --> 28:18.126
who finds herself
all out of appeals.

28:18.160 --> 28:19.726
It's nonsense.

28:19.760 --> 28:21.660
It's an insult to this court,

28:21.693 --> 28:24.326
to our system
of criminal justice,

28:24.360 --> 28:26.893
and Your Honor
shouldn't indulge it further.

28:27.960 --> 28:29.560
Thank you.

28:36.626 --> 28:38.326
He had in his hands

28:38.360 --> 28:41.293
a report that was exculpatory.

28:41.326 --> 28:43.226
He had a duty
to give it to us.

28:43.260 --> 28:44.626
He didn't.

28:44.660 --> 28:46.360
That is black-and-white

28:46.393 --> 28:48.226
prosecutorial misconduct.

28:48.893 --> 28:51.260
We were forced to defend
our entire case

28:51.293 --> 28:53.793
without knowing
the crime lab findings

28:53.826 --> 28:56.193
were in dispute
as to whether the victim

28:56.226 --> 28:57.460
was standing still.

28:58.026 --> 29:00.566
That dispute was kept from us.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.566
Nobody, nobody
can make an argument

29:03.600 --> 29:06.166
that that wasn't relevant.

29:07.266 --> 29:08.666
Now Mr. Walsh

29:08.700 --> 29:11.533
has the temerity
to actually argue

29:11.566 --> 29:13.366
that the victim's
forward movement,

29:13.400 --> 29:15.533
or lack of it, was a nonissue

29:15.566 --> 29:17.800
when all through the trial,
he hammered it.

29:17.833 --> 29:19.466
He put up witnesses to say

29:19.500 --> 29:21.866
that Mr. O'Malley
was stationary.

29:21.900 --> 29:23.333
In his closing, he said it

29:23.366 --> 29:25.433
over and over and over again.

29:25.466 --> 29:26.566
Look at the transcript.

29:26.600 --> 29:28.300
"He was not moving towards her,

29:28.333 --> 29:29.833
never made a movement,

29:29.866 --> 29:31.066
standing still."

29:31.100 --> 29:33.133
He repeated it.

29:33.166 --> 29:34.333
He drove it home

29:34.366 --> 29:36.400
as the linchpin of his case,

29:36.433 --> 29:38.366
and he stands before you today

29:38.400 --> 29:40.433
as a bald-faced liar

29:40.466 --> 29:42.933
saying that it was a nonissue.

29:42.966 --> 29:45.166
Well, it wouldn't
have been a nonissue

29:45.200 --> 29:47.000
to the jury.

29:47.033 --> 29:48.266
This man

29:48.300 --> 29:50.166
has systematically committed

29:50.200 --> 29:52.300
prejudicial misconduct
in this case,

29:52.333 --> 29:54.333
during discovery,
during the trial,

29:54.366 --> 29:56.466
and it constitutes a gross

29:56.500 --> 29:58.900
and egregious violation
of Rule 30,

29:58.933 --> 30:01.473
and we ask the court
to dismiss this indictment

30:01.506 --> 30:04.106
with prejudice,
or, in the alternative,

30:04.140 --> 30:06.606
to strike the record
of the first trial,

30:06.640 --> 30:08.173
the entire record,

30:08.206 --> 30:10.173
including all testimony.

30:10.206 --> 30:11.506
WALSH: There's no authority
for that.

30:11.540 --> 30:12.806
Our argument
to the jury

30:12.840 --> 30:15.106
would've changed
had we known the existence

30:15.140 --> 30:16.040
of this report.

30:16.073 --> 30:17.806
Lindsay Dole was prejudiced

30:17.840 --> 30:19.740
by Mr. Walsh's nondisclosure.

30:19.773 --> 30:22.240
That prejudice can only be cured

30:22.273 --> 30:24.606
by the court's expunging
of the first trial

30:24.640 --> 30:25.740
in its entirety.

30:25.773 --> 30:27.406
Your Honor--
FRUTT: I am not finished!

30:27.440 --> 30:28.740
WEST: You're both finished.

30:30.940 --> 30:32.973
It's in my yard now.

30:33.006 --> 30:34.706
I'll take this under advisement.

30:34.740 --> 30:36.806
I'll call you this afternoon
when I reach my decision.

30:36.840 --> 30:38.840
We're adjourned.
(gavel bangs)

30:54.232 --> 30:55.666
How did it even get this far?

30:55.699 --> 30:57.832
Because he wanted
his day in court.

30:57.866 --> 30:59.399
He told me
he was urinating.

30:59.432 --> 31:01.772
He never said it was
an anti-smoking campaign.

31:03.706 --> 31:04.606
What do I do?

31:04.639 --> 31:06.106
YOUNG: What do you do?

31:06.139 --> 31:07.506
You argue it.
Argue it?

31:07.539 --> 31:09.239
Yes. He says
he's a political activist.

31:09.272 --> 31:11.539
You have no proof he isn't.
You argue it.

31:11.572 --> 31:13.672
You play the hand
you're dealt, Jamie.

31:13.706 --> 31:15.406
Now get in there and close.

31:17.639 --> 31:18.972
Right.

31:20.006 --> 31:21.372
Right.

31:21.406 --> 31:23.406
Hey, I told you to dump it.

31:29.672 --> 31:31.039
What, are you stalking me?

31:31.072 --> 31:32.772
Kind of early, isn't it?

31:33.572 --> 31:34.806
It's after lunch.

31:37.939 --> 31:38.939
How'd I do?

31:40.139 --> 31:42.172
Well, I thought
you did a good job,

31:43.339 --> 31:44.739
but so did Ellenor.

31:48.306 --> 31:51.172
If he expunges
the first trial,

31:51.206 --> 31:52.539
you have to plea.

31:52.572 --> 31:55.039
I'll drive off that bridge
when I come to it.

31:58.539 --> 31:59.939
It wasn't my paranoia, Helen.

31:59.972 --> 32:00.779
You heard her.

32:00.812 --> 32:01.712
She attacked me.

32:01.746 --> 32:04.012
She called me a liar, a--

32:04.046 --> 32:06.046
it was an attack.

32:07.146 --> 32:09.346
And the papers will print
what she said,

32:09.379 --> 32:11.112
and my kids
will have to read it.

32:11.146 --> 32:13.112
Again, it's legal strategy.

32:16.279 --> 32:18.679
But...

32:18.712 --> 32:20.446
when this is over,

32:22.146 --> 32:24.646
you really need to take
a long walk

32:25.479 --> 32:27.146
and ask yourself
what you did

32:27.179 --> 32:28.546
to incur the attack.

32:31.379 --> 32:32.746
Hey,

32:32.779 --> 32:34.712
some of the stuff
I've been doing,

32:36.079 --> 32:38.046
I'll take the walk with you.

32:45.612 --> 32:46.979
ALEXANDER: I don't think
we need to waste

32:47.012 --> 32:49.446
any more of your time here.

32:49.479 --> 32:51.312
Three witnesses
saw the defendant

32:51.346 --> 32:53.046
expose and grope his genitalia

32:53.079 --> 32:54.512
in a lewd and lascivious manner.

32:54.912 --> 32:56.879
Their testimony
stands uncontroverted,

32:56.912 --> 32:58.412
unblemished for that matter.

32:58.812 --> 33:00.919
Mr. Pender has twice
before been arrested

33:00.952 --> 33:02.019
and convicted

33:02.052 --> 33:04.086
for this very
obscene behavior.

33:04.586 --> 33:07.019
To the police,
he says he was urinating.

33:07.052 --> 33:08.886
Then on the stand,
he suddenly claims

33:08.919 --> 33:10.986
that he was trying to dissuade
these three women

33:11.019 --> 33:12.619
from smoking.

33:12.652 --> 33:15.352
Obviously, he doesn't take
this seriously.

33:15.386 --> 33:18.119
I think we need
to impress upon him

33:18.152 --> 33:19.686
that we do.

33:30.052 --> 33:32.886
Free speech is something
that we hold dear

33:32.919 --> 33:35.652
in the United States of America.

33:35.686 --> 33:37.819
We don't punish somebody
for exercising

33:37.852 --> 33:39.152
their First Amendment right

33:39.186 --> 33:40.386
simply because we don't like

33:40.419 --> 33:41.952
the way the message
was delivered.

33:42.719 --> 33:44.419
Political protest
in this country

33:44.452 --> 33:46.452
has often been shocking,

33:46.486 --> 33:48.752
provocative, even offensive.

33:48.786 --> 33:51.219
It's to get attention,

33:51.252 --> 33:52.519
whether it's nudity

33:52.552 --> 33:53.852
or burning draft cards,

33:53.886 --> 33:55.852
the American flag.

33:55.886 --> 33:58.386
Dissidents have
historically chosen

33:58.419 --> 34:00.059
antagonistic methods

34:00.092 --> 34:01.792
to convey political beliefs

34:01.826 --> 34:03.559
that they consider...

34:04.226 --> 34:06.392
precious and--

34:06.992 --> 34:08.025
(gasps) Oh!

34:09.092 --> 34:10.559
Your Honor!

34:10.592 --> 34:12.826
McGOUGH: Bailiff!
Get that man's pants on!

34:12.859 --> 34:13.926
(gavel bangs)

34:13.958 --> 34:16.159
McGOUGH: Get his pants on now!

34:17.926 --> 34:19.759
Save the rain forest?

34:19.792 --> 34:22.025
It was written right across--

34:22.059 --> 34:23.092
YOUNG: So what happened?

34:23.126 --> 34:25.092
Well, the judge
called a mistrial,

34:25.126 --> 34:27.759
then set the retrial
for next July,

34:27.792 --> 34:29.926
then held him with no bail,
which means effectively

34:29.958 --> 34:31.992
he got 10 months of time.

34:32.025 --> 34:34.492
I offered to plead out
at six months.

34:34.525 --> 34:35.891
The D. A. said, "Okay."

34:36.359 --> 34:37.759
That was good.

34:37.792 --> 34:38.759
Good decision.

34:38.792 --> 34:40.592
But the client
won't sign off.

34:41.025 --> 34:41.692
What?

34:41.726 --> 34:43.458
He wants to appeal.

34:43.492 --> 34:45.859
Jamie, you make him sign off.

34:45.891 --> 34:47.092
You go back there right now.

34:47.126 --> 34:47.992
You get tough with him,

34:48.025 --> 34:49.759
and you make him sign off.

34:51.759 --> 34:52.592
Now, go.

34:59.026 --> 35:00.766
Nothing from the clerk's office?

35:00.799 --> 35:02.232
He's still in chambers.

35:02.266 --> 35:03.766
It's almost 3:30.

35:03.799 --> 35:05.532
Which means
he's really considering.

35:05.566 --> 35:06.732
We have a chance.

35:13.299 --> 35:14.766
Ellenor,

35:17.299 --> 35:19.032
I thought
you nailed it in there.

35:22.232 --> 35:23.632
Seriously.

35:24.599 --> 35:27.599
(music playing)

35:31.899 --> 35:33.499
I want to appeal!

35:33.532 --> 35:35.432
STRINGER: You need
to appeal to a shrink.

35:35.466 --> 35:37.232
You ruined my first
closing argument.

35:37.266 --> 35:39.366
I was trying for a mistrial,
which I got.

35:39.399 --> 35:40.832
Yes, but you weren't
counting on no bail,

35:40.866 --> 35:42.366
were you,
Mr. Free Speech?

35:42.399 --> 35:44.232
Six months is the deal.

35:44.266 --> 35:44.932
He can't deny bail.

35:44.966 --> 35:45.999
I haven't been proven guilty.

35:46.032 --> 35:47.232
STRINGER: He can. He did.

35:47.266 --> 35:49.066
You wanna write
your congressman, fine.

35:49.099 --> 35:51.432
But since you can't deliver
the message personally,

35:51.466 --> 35:53.866
you might wanna consider
stationery.

35:53.899 --> 35:55.032
Take the six months,

35:55.066 --> 35:56.699
and be done with it.

36:00.439 --> 36:03.439
(music playing)

36:06.306 --> 36:07.872
He's coming in.

36:09.939 --> 36:12.939
(music playing)

36:34.806 --> 36:36.539
Judges always hate it
when they're asked

36:36.572 --> 36:38.806
to consider the big picture.

36:39.806 --> 36:41.772
It usually means

36:41.806 --> 36:43.439
that justice,
in the short run,

36:43.472 --> 36:44.872
has to take a beating.

36:45.806 --> 36:47.572
Here, the big picture

36:47.606 --> 36:48.839
is the integrity

36:48.872 --> 36:51.239
of the judicial process.

36:51.272 --> 36:53.006
It's a truism that any system

36:53.039 --> 36:54.372
can only be as dignified

36:54.406 --> 36:56.206
as its players,

36:56.239 --> 36:57.906
which means,
for criminal justice,

36:57.939 --> 36:59.472
the truth is indeed ugly.

37:00.579 --> 37:02.645
Defense attorneys long ago
began slithering

37:02.679 --> 37:03.812
under the bar.

37:03.845 --> 37:04.979
Prosecutors soon followed.

37:05.012 --> 37:07.379
By now, we've come to expect it.

37:08.379 --> 37:09.712
But, Mr. Walsh,
that doesn't mean

37:09.745 --> 37:12.112
we must always bring ourselves
to accept it.

37:13.179 --> 37:14.612
The Supreme Judicial Court

37:14.645 --> 37:16.245
has found that you
willfully violated

37:16.279 --> 37:17.779
Ms. Dole's
Fifth Amendment rights,

37:18.279 --> 37:19.479
that you willfully violated

37:19.512 --> 37:21.446
her Sixth Amendment rights.

37:21.479 --> 37:23.279
And now we learn

37:23.312 --> 37:25.512
that you had an exculpatory
report in your hand,

37:25.546 --> 37:27.479
which you were duty-bound
to reveal,

37:27.512 --> 37:28.712
and you squashed it.

37:29.279 --> 37:30.846
That other prosecutors
might do this

37:30.879 --> 37:32.246
only further persuades me

37:32.279 --> 37:34.479
that the big picture
needs adjusting.

37:35.479 --> 37:37.712
I find your misconduct

37:37.746 --> 37:39.846
to be deliberate, egregious,

37:39.879 --> 37:40.879
and outrageous.

37:41.379 --> 37:44.112
I am granting defense counsels
Rule 30 motion

37:44.146 --> 37:45.912
for post-conviction relief.

37:45.946 --> 37:48.379
I am dismissing the indictment

37:48.412 --> 37:49.779
with prejudice.

37:49.812 --> 37:50.912
The defendant

37:50.946 --> 37:52.579
is to be released immediately.

37:53.412 --> 37:54.412
We're adjourned.

37:54.446 --> 37:55.946
(gavel bangs)

37:56.879 --> 37:58.246
I can't believe it.

38:00.652 --> 38:01.886
What happened?

38:06.686 --> 38:08.086
It's over.

38:09.852 --> 38:11.219
I wanna go home.

38:13.352 --> 38:15.086
Take me home, please.

38:16.619 --> 38:18.652
(music playing)

38:47.286 --> 38:49.619
WALSH: It's a sad
but all too familiar comment

38:49.652 --> 38:50.452
on our society,

38:50.486 --> 38:52.086
where in the end,

38:52.119 --> 38:54.186
money talks.

38:54.219 --> 38:55.719
Money!

38:55.752 --> 38:58.386
Enron, Tyco, WorldCom,

38:58.419 --> 39:00.726
the corruption of greed.

39:00.759 --> 39:03.659
People use our courts today.

39:04.726 --> 39:07.192
The Lord is my shepherd.

39:07.226 --> 39:09.992
I won't walk in the shadow
of the valley of...

39:11.692 --> 39:13.159
money.

39:14.692 --> 39:16.459
I stand tall today.

39:16.492 --> 39:18.159
I'll sleep tonight.

39:19.792 --> 39:20.992
People can kill,

39:21.026 --> 39:22.592
murder,

39:22.626 --> 39:24.292
get off on a technicality,

39:24.326 --> 39:25.592
but God forbid

39:25.626 --> 39:27.892
the murderers' civil rights.

39:28.226 --> 39:29.826
The Lord...

39:29.859 --> 39:31.826
will be my truth.

39:31.859 --> 39:33.659
If Lindsay Dole had been a...

39:33.692 --> 39:35.959
black welfare prostitute

39:35.992 --> 39:37.159
from Roxbury,

39:37.192 --> 39:39.126
you think we'd be here?

39:41.659 --> 39:43.692
Sweet land of liberty,

39:43.726 --> 39:46.026
of thee I sing.

39:46.626 --> 39:48.559
But justice didn't sing today.

39:49.226 --> 39:51.126
Justice doesn't sing

39:51.159 --> 39:54.059
in these halls anymore.

39:54.092 --> 39:56.226
Justice has gone mute.

39:56.259 --> 39:58.626
(music playing)

40:14.432 --> 40:16.266
YOUNG: Next on The Practice.

40:16.299 --> 40:18.466
GAMBLE: It makes
the most sense to simply delay

40:18.499 --> 40:20.732
the criminal trial
until after she gives birth.

40:20.766 --> 40:22.199
DONNELL:
It makes no sense to do that

40:22.232 --> 40:24.932
given there's no basis to take
Wendy Hubert into custody.

40:24.966 --> 40:27.632
Section 12, chapter 123,
read the law.

40:27.666 --> 40:29.166
Are you against that
on principle?

40:29.199 --> 40:30.399
You're gonna lecture me
on rules?

40:30.432 --> 40:32.432
GAMBLE: I need you
to think of something.

40:32.466 --> 40:34.232
That baby could be in danger.

40:34.266 --> 40:35.599
FRUTT: He's saying
there's a presumption

40:35.632 --> 40:38.399
of psychiatric infirmity
for any Christian Scientist.

40:38.432 --> 40:39.599
I am not saying that.

40:39.632 --> 40:40.732
You most certainly are.

40:40.766 --> 40:42.699
Are we supposed
to let this baby die?

40:42.732 --> 40:43.799
And then say "Hey,

40:43.832 --> 40:45.166
but at least we didn't trample

40:45.199 --> 40:47.732
the civil liberties
of mommy dearest."

40:47.766 --> 40:50.199
That's crap and I'll say so.

40:52.566 --> 40:55.566
(music playing)

41:17.172 --> 41:18.339
WOMAN: You stinker!

41:20.072 --> 41:22.972
(music playing)
