WEBVTT

00:18.393 --> 00:20.479
(in Korean) Father, I'm home.

00:28.612 --> 00:30.405
Hansu, you're late again.

00:31.323 --> 00:34.243
I had to go across town
to deliver a message.

00:35.452 --> 00:37.788
You are a tutor, not an errand boy.

00:38.372 --> 00:40.582
Perhaps it's worth reminding them of this.

00:41.750 --> 00:42.876
Yes.

00:44.086 --> 00:46.296
Come on! This belly's hungry.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.215
Let's go seek our feast for kings.

00:51.385 --> 00:52.594
Let's go.

01:38.640 --> 01:41.852
Hansu! Hansu!

01:53.238 --> 01:55.741
(in Japanese) So is it true,
what your father tells me?

01:56.325 --> 01:59.453
You're better at the calculations
than he is?

02:02.664 --> 02:05.417
I'm surprised he would say such a thing,

02:05.959 --> 02:08.044
considering he only points out
my mistakes.

02:09.170 --> 02:10.797
A sign of a worthy father.

02:11.590 --> 02:14.384
Only the idiots praise their children
over nothing.

02:21.808 --> 02:23.894
When can you start working for me then?

02:25.020 --> 02:28.524
I have many businesses
that need looking after.

02:29.191 --> 02:31.610
I've been looking for someone
quick on the abacus.

02:31.693 --> 02:34.238
He would be so lucky
to work for you, boss,

02:35.072 --> 02:38.033
but he already has a position
as a math tutor

02:38.116 --> 02:40.661
for a wealthy American family.

02:41.537 --> 02:42.663
As you know,

02:43.288 --> 02:47.042
a job like that is a rare opportunity
for the likes of us.

02:48.877 --> 02:51.046
So you're sucking up to the Americans too?

02:51.547 --> 02:55.425
The Holmes family is good to me.

02:55.509 --> 02:56.718
Of course they are.

02:57.427 --> 03:00.180
It's easy to be good
when it costs you nothing.

03:00.848 --> 03:02.057
What a waste.

03:06.436 --> 03:07.563
Your Japanese,

03:08.355 --> 03:10.023
it's much improved.

03:12.192 --> 03:15.696
But you'll have to work harder
if you really want to be one of us.

03:23.787 --> 03:26.081
Genta, you've gotten better.

05:01.426 --> 05:04.638
You play the fool people say you are.

05:05.222 --> 05:08.892
If you want to succeed in life,
you must apply yourself.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.394
Ask your father.

05:10.894 --> 05:14.106
I'd rather not take that dose
of abject misery if I don't have to.

05:14.189 --> 05:15.774
Misery already?

05:15.858 --> 05:18.610
Couldn't it at least wait
until cocktail hour?

05:18.694 --> 05:20.654
I'm much better angled
at receiving your misery then.

05:20.737 --> 05:22.698
You tease me,
but I have true angst, Mother.

05:23.198 --> 05:26.034
Really? And what is that angst, my son?

05:26.702 --> 05:28.537
Are you deprived of nourishment?

05:28.620 --> 05:30.831
In perilous need of shelter?

05:30.914 --> 05:34.293
Perhaps suffering from some
bodily ailment that knows no cure?

05:34.376 --> 05:37.129
-Shall I fetch the doctor?
-I hate when you do this.

05:37.212 --> 05:38.589
But I must.

05:39.173 --> 05:44.219
Please let the cook know
dinner must be served at 9:00.

05:44.303 --> 05:48.557
We have important guests tonight.
All must be well.

05:52.519 --> 05:54.563
"Essays on the Theory of Numbers."

05:54.646 --> 05:56.857
Hansu, do you really understand all this?

05:58.108 --> 05:59.359
I believe so.

06:00.527 --> 06:02.863
Remarkable. Call me smitten.

06:05.991 --> 06:09.036
But really, Mother, I have a thought.
Why don't we bring Hansu with us?

06:09.703 --> 06:12.331
What a boon he would be for me
at Yale next year.

06:12.831 --> 06:15.083
Otherwise, I would fail. You know I would.

06:15.167 --> 06:16.543
That's an idea.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.340
She'll talk to Father.

06:22.299 --> 06:23.592
Speaking of Father,

06:24.510 --> 06:27.095
Hansu, run along
and deliver this to him, will you?

06:29.014 --> 06:30.015
I should be off.

06:30.098 --> 06:33.185
But you, push away those dark clouds.

06:33.769 --> 06:34.978
Try, will you?

07:27.155 --> 07:28.991
I don't understand this balking of yours.

07:29.074 --> 07:31.326
You're talking about
a substantial amount of capital

07:31.410 --> 07:33.954
invested into a country
that isn't even ours.

07:34.037 --> 07:36.415
Hell, I wonder if they even want us here,
or our money.

07:36.498 --> 07:37.708
What does it matter?

07:37.791 --> 07:39.585
As long as we're the ones
making the fortune.

07:39.668 --> 07:41.044
But for how long?

07:41.128 --> 07:44.006
Yokohama may embrace our world,
but the rest of this nation?

07:44.089 --> 07:46.550
They've had their chance
to steel themselves against us.

07:46.633 --> 07:49.094
And now, really,

07:49.178 --> 07:52.347
once a country's been pried open,
how can it possibly go back?

07:52.431 --> 07:54.933
I'm telling you, don't be that fool

07:55.017 --> 07:57.269
raging against the change of progress.

07:57.352 --> 07:59.563
Because you know what happens
to people like that?

07:59.646 --> 08:02.566
We're the ones that end up
with all the money in the bank.

08:02.649 --> 08:03.901
Well…

08:03.984 --> 08:04.985
Look here.

08:05.068 --> 08:08.488
Who's this young fellow who has
so graciously come to save me?

08:08.572 --> 08:09.615
Another message.

08:18.749 --> 08:21.210
Message received.

08:21.293 --> 08:22.461
Now, tell me.

08:23.086 --> 08:25.631
How is that son of mine faring these days?

08:25.714 --> 08:28.342
He tries his best, sir.

08:29.301 --> 08:32.179
So, still unimpressive then.

08:34.765 --> 08:35.974
Enjoy your evening.

08:40.938 --> 08:42.481
Good mind, that one.

08:42.563 --> 08:44.942
It'll be interesting to see
what comes of him.

09:01.834 --> 09:04.586
Are we cursed never to have
a great player of our own?

09:05.170 --> 09:09.174
Don't insult that brain of yours
with such ridiculous thoughts.

09:09.258 --> 09:12.219
Remember, you're not one of them.

09:13.720 --> 09:16.932
But the Americans,
why are they good at so many things?

09:17.599 --> 09:19.852
You only need to be good at one thing.

09:19.935 --> 09:21.061
One.

09:21.144 --> 09:24.231
But whatever it is,
you make sure you're the very best.

09:24.815 --> 09:26.400
Is that the abacus for you?

09:27.067 --> 09:28.485
That's just the tool.

09:28.986 --> 09:31.780
No, I'm good at making money
for other people.

09:32.739 --> 09:35.242
Can't you make us some money then?

09:36.118 --> 09:37.619
What'd I say?

09:38.203 --> 09:41.206
A person only needs
to be good at one thing.

09:42.708 --> 09:45.627
What should I be good at then?

09:47.337 --> 09:49.965
You think you're gonna have a choice?

09:50.549 --> 09:53.427
Most of the time,
whether you will it or not,

09:53.510 --> 09:54.553
it'll be undeniable.

09:56.847 --> 09:58.432
You first, Father.

10:02.394 --> 10:05.022
And did you know at my age?

10:07.900 --> 10:10.611
I thought I was going to be
a fisherman like my father.

10:11.737 --> 10:13.655
That's how it was then.

10:17.576 --> 10:19.286
But you,

10:19.369 --> 10:21.205
you're not to be a fisherman.

10:22.956 --> 10:25.125
And no back rooms, no betting slips,

10:25.209 --> 10:26.919
no cleaning blood off the floor.

10:27.836 --> 10:31.715
Whatever your thing is, it's going
to get us out of that boxing hall.

10:39.848 --> 10:44.228
I think they're going to ask me
to go to America with them.

10:44.311 --> 10:45.312
To Yale.

10:46.063 --> 10:47.523
They'll pay for your education?

10:47.606 --> 10:48.649
No.

10:48.732 --> 10:51.401
Not for me, for Andrew.

10:51.485 --> 10:53.320
That loser son of theirs?

10:55.197 --> 10:58.534
If it weren't for his privilege,
he'd be swallowed whole by this world.

11:02.329 --> 11:07.251
Instead, it's my son
who must shoulder that inadequacy.

11:13.423 --> 11:14.466
But, Father,

11:15.300 --> 11:18.887
in America,
they say even people like us can rise.

11:22.140 --> 11:23.183
"People like us."

11:24.893 --> 11:27.771
By wagering our hopes and dreams
against us,

11:28.647 --> 11:31.525
that's how they fool us.

11:39.908 --> 11:41.159
But even with that,

11:41.869 --> 11:43.787
I want you to take that bet.

11:44.663 --> 11:46.206
You're going to America.

11:47.624 --> 11:48.959
But what about you?

11:50.169 --> 11:51.211
What about me?

11:51.753 --> 11:53.422
You're always saying we're a team,

11:54.006 --> 11:56.133
that we'll always be attached together.

11:59.970 --> 12:03.098
Maybe it's time to shift our perspective.

12:03.807 --> 12:07.519
Why look down
when you can soar up instead?

12:08.729 --> 12:11.481
It's time to look higher.

12:13.317 --> 12:14.526
Hansu,

12:15.068 --> 12:19.990
you have a chance
to do things I never could.

12:27.581 --> 12:30.501
In the night sky, there are two stars.

12:31.418 --> 12:35.714
They may look close to one another,
but, in truth, they are far, far apart.

12:37.341 --> 12:40.719
A distance we cannot possibly fathom.

12:41.678 --> 12:43.222
But even so,

12:43.305 --> 12:44.890
from down here,

12:46.391 --> 12:48.435
they look inseparable,

12:49.645 --> 12:50.812
don't they?

13:06.745 --> 13:07.746
A toast.

13:47.119 --> 13:48.620
What the hell is this?

13:48.704 --> 13:50.372
I've never done this before.

13:50.455 --> 13:51.498
I swear.

13:52.749 --> 13:54.751
I borrowed a little money.

13:54.835 --> 13:58.130
I was going to return it
as soon as I got paid.

13:59.006 --> 14:01.091
I needed the money right away,

14:01.175 --> 14:03.802
otherwise, I would've asked you.

14:03.886 --> 14:05.387
I'm so ashamed.

14:06.221 --> 14:09.433
Please, give me a few hours.
I'll get the money.

14:10.434 --> 14:12.394
You know what'll happen if you run.

14:12.477 --> 14:14.188
But where would I go?

14:14.897 --> 14:16.148
I have a son.

14:16.940 --> 14:20.360
I would never allow him
to see me run away.

14:21.195 --> 14:23.530
You have until the noon bell rings.

14:24.198 --> 14:25.991
Yes, by noon.

14:26.658 --> 14:27.659
I promise.

14:29.203 --> 14:31.872
I warned you that girl was trouble.

14:47.387 --> 14:48.764
Father.

14:51.850 --> 14:53.018
Father!

14:55.729 --> 14:56.813
How much money was it?

14:57.648 --> 14:58.690
Two hundred.

14:59.274 --> 15:00.943
But you heard me.

15:01.026 --> 15:02.736
I was going to pay it right back.

15:04.404 --> 15:05.989
You stole that money.

15:06.782 --> 15:07.783
No.

15:08.784 --> 15:10.494
She begged me. What could I do?

15:10.577 --> 15:12.621
You say no.

15:16.208 --> 15:18.377
It's all so simple to you

15:19.294 --> 15:21.421
because you've never
even been with a woman.

15:22.881 --> 15:24.675
But one day, you will fall in love,

15:24.758 --> 15:28.303
and you, too, will lose yourself to her.

15:33.600 --> 15:34.810
I won't do what you did.

15:36.270 --> 15:37.312
Never.

15:46.613 --> 15:49.157
I'm sorry to have caused you
so much trouble.

15:52.536 --> 15:56.206
But I didn't think you'd go that far.

15:59.585 --> 16:02.462
You know I am a poor man.

16:10.470 --> 16:11.513
Yes.

16:11.597 --> 16:13.348
Well,

16:13.432 --> 16:14.808
what's done is done.

16:15.601 --> 16:17.686
But I must return the money right away.

16:20.105 --> 16:21.190
How much is left?

16:28.405 --> 16:30.115
Can you return what you bought?

16:30.199 --> 16:32.201
It wasn't for me.

16:35.245 --> 16:38.081
The money was for a friend.

16:38.165 --> 16:39.499
You loaned the money?

16:41.835 --> 16:43.170
No.

16:44.379 --> 16:46.548
I will never see that money again.

16:47.382 --> 16:50.802
He's-- That's just who he is.

16:59.269 --> 17:03.899
You are the smartest man I know,
and yet…

17:14.492 --> 17:16.161
I'll go see Mr. Holmes.

17:17.329 --> 17:18.329
No.

17:18.955 --> 17:20.374
If I tell him the situation,

17:20.457 --> 17:21.959
I know he'll loan me the money.

17:25.212 --> 17:27.297
And if he decides
not to take you to America then?

17:28.382 --> 17:30.008
Who cares about that now?

17:31.552 --> 17:34.012
Don't you understand
how dangerous a man Ryochi is?

17:34.805 --> 17:37.349
You're going. That's final.

17:37.975 --> 17:38.976
I won't.

17:39.643 --> 17:41.228
You ingrate!

17:41.311 --> 17:44.189
After all I sacrificed for you,
you dare disobey me?

17:45.190 --> 17:46.191
Father.

17:47.276 --> 17:48.694
In your eyes,

17:49.528 --> 17:52.781
I see the reflection of a ridiculous man.

17:55.492 --> 17:57.077
That's not how I see you.

17:57.160 --> 17:59.162
Go! Go!

17:59.663 --> 18:01.415
I want you to get on that ship

18:01.498 --> 18:03.292
and get the hell out of
this wretched place!

18:04.793 --> 18:06.128
I won't go!

18:06.211 --> 18:07.462
Listen!

18:08.630 --> 18:09.923
Go.

18:12.134 --> 18:13.927
Don't ever come back.

18:14.428 --> 18:15.429
Never!

18:18.056 --> 18:19.057
I refuse.

18:21.977 --> 18:23.854
I won't leave you.

18:32.362 --> 18:33.906
I never want to see you again, you hear?

18:34.656 --> 18:37.409
You're on your own! Get out of here!

18:42.873 --> 18:43.916
Father!

18:45.042 --> 18:46.418
From now on…

18:48.921 --> 18:50.839
you must kill me in your heart.

18:53.967 --> 18:55.969
You'll be better for it.

19:01.850 --> 19:03.769
It's the only way.

19:26.124 --> 19:27.793
Stop. You don't want to see this.

19:41.932 --> 19:45.644
I'll work here until the debt is paid.

19:48.647 --> 19:50.023
This doesn't involve him.

19:51.984 --> 19:53.277
Please let him go.

19:59.241 --> 20:01.159
I'll work as many hours as it takes.

20:01.243 --> 20:02.661
I don't even need to be paid.

20:04.496 --> 20:07.583
But my son must not be part of this.

20:10.210 --> 20:11.628
What do you think happens

20:12.296 --> 20:16.884
when people hear you stole from me,
and I did nothing?

20:19.219 --> 20:23.682
In this world,
how you are seen is everything.

20:24.183 --> 20:27.561
And this kind of shame follows you.

20:28.353 --> 20:30.606
I don't care about me.

20:31.106 --> 20:33.650
All I think about is my son.

20:34.234 --> 20:38.322
The family he tutors for
is taking him to America.

20:40.324 --> 20:42.534
If you tell me to die, I'll die!

20:42.618 --> 20:44.119
But he'll never get this chance again.

20:44.203 --> 20:45.287
Please, leave him be.

20:45.370 --> 20:47.414
This debt must be mine to pay.

20:48.582 --> 20:49.583
Boss!

20:50.292 --> 20:51.418
Father.

20:52.753 --> 20:53.754
Get up, Father.

20:54.838 --> 20:56.048
Genta.

21:04.806 --> 21:07.184
A father's love is a noble thing.

21:08.143 --> 21:09.853
I'm a father myself.

21:11.730 --> 21:13.232
But the man at the top

21:13.732 --> 21:17.152
needs to maintain order,
even if it's just an illusion.

21:21.698 --> 21:26.411
I believe generosity can be more powerful.

21:31.041 --> 21:34.336
And let's see how far you get
with the generosity, kid.

21:38.131 --> 21:39.550
What the--

21:44.805 --> 21:47.182
Get out of here! Hansu, run!

21:50.269 --> 21:51.311
Hansu!

22:04.032 --> 22:05.158
Hansu!

22:08.203 --> 22:09.329
Hansu!

22:17.421 --> 22:18.630
Hansu.

22:18.714 --> 22:20.007
Hansu!

22:21.842 --> 22:23.218
Hansu!

23:55.227 --> 23:58.313
Snap out of it! Move!

23:58.397 --> 23:59.690
Get to higher ground!

24:01.024 --> 24:03.902
There may be more aftershocks. Run!

24:09.491 --> 24:10.701
This way!

24:30.762 --> 24:32.931
We'll have to wait it out.

24:49.948 --> 24:52.159
Would you really have done it?

24:54.286 --> 24:55.871
Would you have killed my father?

24:57.623 --> 24:59.333
For the sake of his honor,

25:00.209 --> 25:02.753
he had a debt to pay.

25:05.506 --> 25:07.716
But the death he got…

25:12.763 --> 25:14.264
Since coming here,

25:16.141 --> 25:21.855
I've had to watch my father
endure so many humiliations.

25:24.733 --> 25:27.945
And for me to just leave him like that…

25:38.539 --> 25:42.125
I know your father had to swallow
his pride to work for me.

25:43.460 --> 25:45.629
So don't go wasting that sacrifice of his.

25:46.338 --> 25:47.422
You know what you need to do.

25:50.926 --> 25:53.178
Follow that Yankee family of yours,
you hear me?

25:53.846 --> 25:56.348
And forget all this, even him.

26:02.271 --> 26:04.147
I don't know what to do.

26:04.731 --> 26:06.441
He's my father.

26:06.525 --> 26:08.777
-He's all I ever had!
-Stand up!

26:11.488 --> 26:12.823
Take a good look!

26:15.742 --> 26:17.578
You're not the only one suffering today.

26:18.954 --> 26:21.415
Today, there are countless new orphans.

26:22.624 --> 26:24.251
But in times like these,

26:24.960 --> 26:26.920
a man forges his destiny.

26:28.422 --> 26:30.507
There will be those
who suffer and move on,

26:32.426 --> 26:34.845
and those who can only wallow
in their miseries.

26:37.639 --> 26:39.433
Don't be one of those fools.

26:41.810 --> 26:43.187
I'm going to find my family.

26:43.270 --> 26:44.771
You get moving.

26:45.355 --> 26:47.107
Go grab that new life.

27:10.631 --> 27:11.924
Hansu?

27:12.007 --> 27:13.008
Andrew.

27:14.510 --> 27:16.470
Look at you. My God.

27:17.596 --> 27:18.931
Where's your father?

27:21.099 --> 27:22.267
Oh, Hansu.

27:23.018 --> 27:24.353
That's terrible.

27:25.604 --> 27:27.356
You're still coming with us, aren't you?

27:28.899 --> 27:30.609
You must know, we won't be coming back.

27:32.486 --> 27:33.779
I want to go.

27:35.239 --> 27:36.907
Please finish loading all this.

27:37.699 --> 27:41.286
And, Andrew, the silver candelabrum.
It's in the butler's pantry.

27:42.538 --> 27:44.289
He can't go back in the house.

27:44.373 --> 27:46.208
He'll be swift. Won't you now?

27:46.959 --> 27:48.627
Lend me a hand here.

27:51.713 --> 27:53.048
Hold on.

28:07.980 --> 28:09.439
Yes, we must go.

28:11.400 --> 28:12.776
Mr. Holmes?

28:12.860 --> 28:14.111
He--

28:14.194 --> 28:17.197
He went ahead to get the boat ready.
We set sail right away.

28:17.281 --> 28:18.866
Leave the cart.

28:18.949 --> 28:20.742
The roads, they are gone.

28:20.826 --> 28:22.953
How are we going to make it
to the water then?

28:26.290 --> 28:29.126
-No, we can't go down there.
-It's the only way.

28:31.712 --> 28:33.380
Forget the cart.

28:34.256 --> 28:35.757
The roads are all gone.

28:36.717 --> 28:38.302
Find your families.

29:45.244 --> 29:47.079
-Mom?
-Andrew!

29:48.413 --> 29:50.666
-Mom!
-Mrs. Holmes!

29:54.586 --> 29:56.338
Mom! Hansu!

29:56.421 --> 29:57.422
Andrew!

30:18.360 --> 30:20.362
Mom, hurry! This way! Run!

31:21.840 --> 31:23.175
You.

33:24.630 --> 33:26.089
What is it?

33:46.401 --> 33:48.654
What are you doing?

34:25.440 --> 34:26.817
You can come out now.

34:27.525 --> 34:29.235
You don't need to hide anymore.

34:30.279 --> 34:31.362
Come on out now.

34:32.197 --> 34:34.241
I'm here.

34:39.996 --> 34:40.998
Please sit.

34:49.172 --> 34:51.007
Do you have any sake?

34:51.091 --> 34:55.012
Unfortunately, the ground drank it all up.

34:55.094 --> 34:57.181
We can serve tea.

35:54.947 --> 35:57.407
Was your family safe?

35:58.575 --> 36:03.288
I haven't been able to get home.
The bridge by the temple collapsed.

36:05.582 --> 36:07.876
And the roads behind the station
are in flames.

36:09.753 --> 36:12.923
I was on my way to the bridge by the park
when I ran into you.

36:15.259 --> 36:18.846
But if we stay on this road,
I should be able to reach them.

36:20.597 --> 36:21.932
I hope they're safe.

36:34.236 --> 36:36.655
What is it? What's happened?

36:37.823 --> 36:40.868
There's been a huge jailbreak
at Negishi Prison.

36:41.577 --> 36:44.538
Three hundred Korean prisoners
are among the escapees.

36:45.122 --> 36:47.374
Now they're headed this way.

36:47.457 --> 36:51.295
Hear they've been planning this escape
for a while.

36:51.378 --> 36:54.798
Now they're taking advantage
of the disaster as their cover.

36:54.882 --> 36:56.717
What are they supposed to do?

36:56.800 --> 36:58.510
Burn to death?

36:59.094 --> 37:02.931
But who knows what trouble they'll cause.

37:03.015 --> 37:05.017
Our women and children are in the streets.

37:05.100 --> 37:07.186
How do we protect them
from such dangerous elements?

37:07.269 --> 37:08.854
Calm down.

37:10.814 --> 37:12.858
Have you heard?
A gang of Koreans have escaped!

37:13.442 --> 37:17.446
It'll take them hours to walk here--

37:17.529 --> 37:19.615
Apparently, they're here,
and I hear they're looting.

37:19.698 --> 37:22.951
Miss, where are you hearing this?

37:23.035 --> 37:25.954
-Who are you?
-The one asking questions. Now answer.

37:27.039 --> 37:29.166
Don't drink the water from the well.

37:29.249 --> 37:31.126
They're saying
the Koreans have poisoned it.

37:31.210 --> 37:32.711
Stop spreading baseless rumors.

37:32.794 --> 37:35.088
Come. I have to find my family.

37:36.381 --> 37:38.217
Thank you. What do I owe you?

37:38.300 --> 37:40.052
Today, nothing.

37:45.641 --> 37:49.186
Something's happening. Stay close.

37:55.359 --> 37:57.569
He's one of them. How can we trust him?

37:57.653 --> 37:59.780
Help us!

37:59.863 --> 38:01.490
I know the barn's owner.

38:01.573 --> 38:03.075
Go to the barn.

38:03.158 --> 38:05.410
He'll be okay letting you hide in there.

38:05.911 --> 38:07.996
Be quick! Hurry!

38:08.080 --> 38:10.290
-What is he saying?
-He knows the owner.

38:10.791 --> 38:12.167
He said to go into the barn. Hurry!

38:21.718 --> 38:23.512
You should hide with them as well.

38:24.680 --> 38:26.807
No time. Get in the cart!

38:28.225 --> 38:29.518
Hurry!

38:37.943 --> 38:39.862
Don't move. Don't even breathe.

38:46.285 --> 38:48.537
-Hurry!
-Find them!

38:51.039 --> 38:53.834
Four men ran this way. Where'd they go?

38:55.586 --> 38:56.753
What did they do?

38:56.837 --> 38:59.756
I'm hearing the Koreans are rioting
all over the city.

38:59.840 --> 39:00.924
There's more.

39:01.550 --> 39:04.553
Going into fallen houses,
stealing anything of value.

39:04.636 --> 39:06.930
We have to catch them,
or they'll take everything.

39:09.224 --> 39:10.976
Those animals.

39:13.103 --> 39:14.813
How dare they do this to us?

39:15.564 --> 39:17.649
We let them in,

39:18.233 --> 39:20.152
give them jobs,

39:20.986 --> 39:22.738
and this is what we get.

39:22.821 --> 39:25.407
Did you see them or not? Tell me.

39:25.490 --> 39:26.575
They're getting away.

39:28.619 --> 39:30.454
Yeah, we saw them.

39:31.371 --> 39:33.207
Four of them.

39:42.090 --> 39:43.217
That way!

39:45.636 --> 39:46.803
Here we go!

39:48.555 --> 39:50.015
What's in there?

39:52.100 --> 39:53.519
Just a barn.

39:55.437 --> 39:57.814
It's a good thing the owner's away.

39:57.898 --> 40:02.611
But he'll be shocked
to find the mess when he returns.

40:09.409 --> 40:10.452
Check it out.

40:12.412 --> 40:15.541
Didn't you hear the old man?
He said they didn't go that way.

40:17.292 --> 40:19.294
Maybe they snuck in
when you weren't looking.

40:20.003 --> 40:21.588
They're cunning.

40:25.676 --> 40:27.928
I found them! They're here!

40:28.428 --> 40:29.513
Let's go!

40:35.102 --> 40:36.812
Set it on fire!

40:51.034 --> 40:52.202
We have to go.

40:53.370 --> 40:54.621
There's nothing you can do.

40:54.705 --> 40:56.331
They'll just throw you in there.

42:16.787 --> 42:18.413
I know some of those folks.

42:30.759 --> 42:31.969
Father!

42:39.685 --> 42:42.896
We waited for you,
and then thought we lost you.

42:43.605 --> 42:47.150
And I bet you wished for it.

42:47.901 --> 42:49.236
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

42:49.319 --> 42:51.822
How can you joke at a time like this?

42:55.450 --> 42:56.869
Because we are together again.

43:17.764 --> 43:20.309
Hansu, come.

43:26.440 --> 43:28.358
We'll be taking care of him for a while.

43:32.529 --> 43:34.865
You still have a father's debt to pay.
