01:01.728 --> 01:04.481
Mo, you weren't bullshitting
about your mother's olive oil.

01:04.564 --> 01:06.983
That's the best stuff
I've ever eaten in my life.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.109
Tried to tell you.

01:08.193 --> 01:09.611
Son of a bitch.

01:11.404 --> 01:14.365
That looks like real olives. Got GPS, huh?

01:14.866 --> 01:18.870
Sure does. And once it leaves the farm,
it'll just send you a signal.

01:19.370 --> 01:20.455
-Hm.
-Mm-hm.

01:20.538 --> 01:21.664
Just like that.

01:22.957 --> 01:24.876
You look like you're wiring a bomb.

01:28.046 --> 01:29.297
'Cause I'm Arab?

01:29.380 --> 01:33.051
No. Hell no. That just popped in my head.

01:33.134 --> 01:36.054
If Manny was doing this,
you'd be thinking the same thing?

01:37.013 --> 01:39.057
Why would Manny be wiring a bomb?

01:42.977 --> 01:44.020
That's what I'm…

01:45.063 --> 01:46.106
Unbelievable.

01:55.615 --> 01:56.991
Why are you all dressed up?

01:57.492 --> 02:01.329
-Shila's seen you naked more than I have.
-Because we played college volleyball?

02:01.412 --> 02:03.623
Yeah. Those women's locker rooms.

02:03.706 --> 02:07.669
Bunch of topless girls.
Group showers. I've seen those movies.

02:07.752 --> 02:09.712
Filthy movies
made by sick men.

02:12.173 --> 02:14.134
-How do I look?
-Fantastic.

02:14.217 --> 02:17.095
-I just need her to take me seriously.
-She knows you're legit.

02:17.178 --> 02:19.264
-She's been to your shop.
-She calls it cute.

02:19.347 --> 02:21.850
Like I got a lemonade stand or something.

02:22.559 --> 02:23.977
Oh.

02:24.686 --> 02:27.730
I do not wanna beg her and Glen for money.

02:27.814 --> 02:28.648
Then don't.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.484
Let me get the cash,
and I'll take care of you.

02:32.902 --> 02:33.862
You wanna help?

02:33.945 --> 02:38.074
Just don't sell all this shit
and come with me to handle Glen, please?

02:38.158 --> 02:41.494
Oh, the filthy rich White guy
who started a blues band as a hobby?

02:41.578 --> 02:44.205
Filthy enough to get
a six million dollar mansion.

02:44.289 --> 02:46.958
Goddamn. Six million?

02:47.041 --> 02:50.545
By the way, please promise me
you'll get there as soon as you can.

02:50.628 --> 02:52.630
-Yeah.
-The party starts at one.

02:52.714 --> 02:56.467
-I wanna pitch it to her before then.
-All right, I'll be there.

02:56.551 --> 03:00.263
I'll sell these watches and head over.
It'll be great. Come here.

03:01.264 --> 03:04.100
You'll do great.
You're gonna do fucking amazing.

03:04.601 --> 03:06.561
Come on. Get it together. You got this.

03:08.396 --> 03:09.397
Come on. Go.

03:20.450 --> 03:22.410
Thank you very much. Thank you.

03:24.078 --> 03:25.038
Oh, my God.

03:33.504 --> 03:35.590
-Hi

03:35.673 --> 03:39.594
-The house is amazing. Incredible.
-Thank you so much for coming!

03:40.178 --> 03:43.056
Shila, this is not a house,
this is a castle.

03:43.139 --> 03:47.518
Yeah, I wanted to remodel it
before we moved in, but, ugh, Glen…

03:47.602 --> 03:48.853
Where is Glen?

03:48.937 --> 03:53.858
Oh, band practice. He's playing at some
big crypto conference thing next week.

03:53.942 --> 03:55.235
Bitcoin and blues, huh?

03:56.236 --> 03:58.279
Don't, it's embarrassing.

03:58.363 --> 04:00.365
But the blues make him happy, so…

04:00.448 --> 04:02.867
Shall I show you around?

04:02.951 --> 04:04.911
-Please.

04:04.994 --> 04:06.579
Ah, thank you for coming.

04:30.436 --> 04:31.354
What the f--

04:32.522 --> 04:33.439
Shit.

04:46.536 --> 04:47.370
Shit!

04:47.912 --> 04:49.330
What's up, man?

04:49.414 --> 04:51.165
Uh, I'm Mo.

04:51.249 --> 04:54.919
I'm here to meet Dante.
AJ sent me. You know AJ?

04:55.461 --> 04:56.504
Let me see you!

04:57.755 --> 04:58.798
There you go.

04:59.674 --> 05:00.883
Stay tight. Stay tight.

05:01.467 --> 05:02.635
Yeah.

05:03.344 --> 05:04.679
Yeah.

05:05.513 --> 05:09.183
Mom's in the crib!
There it is! There it is!

05:09.726 --> 05:12.061
Ooh! Watch your stance. Watch your stance.

05:12.145 --> 05:13.396
Yo, what's up, man. I'm Mo.

05:13.980 --> 05:14.814
Dante.

05:15.315 --> 05:18.192
That's my fighter right there.
Fuck him up, Shiv!

05:18.276 --> 05:19.235
Earn that purse, baby!

05:19.319 --> 05:23.448
Damn, his name is Shiv?
It's like stabbing, bro? That's wild, man.

05:23.531 --> 05:24.407
He's dirty.

05:24.490 --> 05:28.286
You know he's a bad motherfucker.
Look at his ears. He's got them MMA ears.

05:28.369 --> 05:32.665
Them calcified cauliflower ears.
Looks like a pit bull chewed on them hoes.

05:32.749 --> 05:35.418
Can he even hear me?
Yo, Shiv! You an asshole!

05:35.501 --> 05:38.921
He can hear. My bad. I was just joking.
Just playing. Tell him.

05:39.005 --> 05:42.467
You good, bro. Come on.
What you got, watch man?

05:42.550 --> 05:43.634
First batch.

05:44.218 --> 05:48.973
Bam. Look at that.
I got Bulova, Daytonas. Bam. Look at that.

05:49.057 --> 05:51.768
-Got the Rolex with the bezel.
-Oh, shit, hold on.

05:51.851 --> 05:56.064
-With the fluted bezel. What's up?
-Don't trip. I gotta take my insulin.

06:03.571 --> 06:04.781
You good, bro?

06:04.864 --> 06:08.117
-Want something to drink?
-Yeah, I'd love something to drink.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.703
-Big Red, Redbull?
-Big Red would be great.

06:11.496 --> 06:14.999
It'd be refreshing.
It's hotter than a motherfucker in here.

06:15.500 --> 06:18.586
-You don't even use an alcohol swab, bro?
-Fuck that.

06:19.087 --> 06:21.798
-We're thugging right here.
-Thank you, bro.

06:21.881 --> 06:25.218
-Thugs can be hygienic as well.
-We got him.

06:26.636 --> 06:27.553
He's here?

06:28.596 --> 06:30.681
Want me to tell our boy to bounce?

06:30.765 --> 06:32.016
No, he can stay.

06:32.809 --> 06:34.227
We'll make it a two-for-one.

06:38.272 --> 06:39.357
Whoo!

06:41.192 --> 06:42.902
Good work, Shiv. Good work!

06:42.985 --> 06:44.779
You good, baby. You good.

06:45.279 --> 06:47.865
Go throw back some raw eggs
or something.

06:47.949 --> 06:50.076
-Like Rocky, yeah.
-Yeah, like Rocky.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.286
Watch man.

06:53.371 --> 06:55.164
-You stay here.
-Stay what? Where?

06:56.332 --> 06:57.458
Uh…

06:57.542 --> 06:58.751
What?

06:58.835 --> 06:59.669
Um…

06:59.752 --> 07:03.631
Yo, man. Look, look…
I can just come back some other time.

07:03.714 --> 07:06.676
-You're busy.
-No, you're good. Don't trip.

07:06.759 --> 07:09.637
-Come on. Show me the watches.
-No, don't worry.

07:09.720 --> 07:11.764
Call me Stevie Wonder.
I don't see anything.

07:11.848 --> 07:15.101
I've never snitched in my life.
I'll come back tomorrow.

07:15.184 --> 07:16.519
Show me the watches!

07:18.229 --> 07:19.230
Okay.

07:19.313 --> 07:21.566
Still want that Big Red? Take a sip.

07:23.025 --> 07:24.110
Go ahead.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.823
I know it's too big
for just the two of us. But…

07:28.906 --> 07:30.408
Glen really wanted a zoo.

07:30.491 --> 07:31.868
You have a zoo?

07:31.951 --> 07:32.952
Just a small one.

07:33.619 --> 07:34.495
Oh.

07:35.329 --> 07:38.124
Don't feel bad for living in a dope house.

07:38.624 --> 07:41.711
Plus, I've always wanted
a friend with a pool.

07:41.794 --> 07:43.754
This house, it's not just for us.

07:43.838 --> 07:46.799
It's about giving back to our friends,

07:46.883 --> 07:48.176
to our community.

07:48.259 --> 07:50.344
We'll host so many fundraisers here.

07:50.428 --> 07:53.681
Which is why I thought you'd want
to invest in a small local business.

07:54.182 --> 07:56.142
-Like my shop.
-Oh, no. Is it going under?

07:56.225 --> 07:57.727
No. No, no, no.

07:57.810 --> 08:01.147
We're actually doing so well,
we're turning away clients.

08:01.230 --> 08:03.274
So, I wanna open a second shop.

08:03.858 --> 08:05.526
Ah!

08:05.610 --> 08:08.070
Maria, the boss lady!

08:10.072 --> 08:11.032
It's adorable.

08:12.283 --> 08:15.119
I thought before Glen arrives,
I'd show you the business plan--

08:15.203 --> 08:17.538
Hey, honey! Look who I found.

08:17.622 --> 08:20.500
Maria! <i>¿Qué pasa?</i>

08:20.583 --> 08:21.959
-Hi.
Bam.

08:23.002 --> 08:25.046
I love it
when you speak Spanish.

08:26.047 --> 08:29.383
-So what's this plan, Maria?
-Tell us about the plan.

08:30.176 --> 08:31.010
Hm.

08:34.305 --> 08:37.141
Yeah, I mean,
these are all perpetual motion.

08:37.225 --> 08:40.645
-Is that shit waterproof?
-Yeah, I mean, it's water-resistant.

08:40.728 --> 08:43.773
-I wouldn't go scuba--
-Shut the fuck up!

08:45.066 --> 08:47.985
You want me to put another piece
of tape on your fucking nostrils?

08:48.653 --> 08:51.948
I'm sorry, bro. He's mad inconsiderate.
What were you saying?

08:52.031 --> 08:54.075
-He's so rude.
-Fucking asshole.

08:54.158 --> 09:00.414
So, it's like I said, this is a perpetual.
Just shake it. You don't need a battery.

09:00.498 --> 09:01.415
Oh, shit.

09:01.958 --> 09:05.628
Look, bro. I really can't do this.
I got an asylum case coming up.

09:05.711 --> 09:08.839
You know what I mean?
I'll just take this here, all right?

09:08.923 --> 09:12.260
-And I'm just gonna-- I've seen CSI.
-CSI.

09:12.343 --> 09:15.596
I'm just gonna wipe off my fingerprints.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.723
-You know, for DNA purposes.
-Of course.

09:17.807 --> 09:19.350
I've seen how they work.

09:19.850 --> 09:23.354
-Thank you. I'll be back. I got you. Huh?
-Hey, hey.

09:27.191 --> 09:28.484
I mean…

09:28.568 --> 09:30.570
I could hang out too. You know?

09:30.653 --> 09:34.031
We could just…
watch TV or something.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.158
Don't wanna know what that guy do?

09:36.242 --> 09:38.661
No, I don't think
you should tell me anything.

09:38.744 --> 09:42.206
A couple of months ago,
I got a dispute with a business rival.

09:42.290 --> 09:43.833
Things got heated, and I ended up

09:43.916 --> 09:46.586
with a Megan Thee Stallion situation
regarding my foot.

09:46.669 --> 09:48.963
No, I don't. I love Megan.
Not the Stallion!

09:49.046 --> 09:51.716
We both know I can't go to the hospital.

09:51.799 --> 09:53.050
-I can relate.
-Right?

09:53.134 --> 09:57.305
So I call this guy here,
and I pay him cash to patch me up.

09:57.388 --> 10:02.351
He does his thing, hands me a bottle
of codeine and tells me I'm good to go.

10:02.435 --> 10:05.771
Not three weeks later,
I'm in the hospital,

10:05.855 --> 10:08.608
a doctor telling me
they gotta amputate my leg.

10:10.610 --> 10:11.444
You know why?

10:12.862 --> 10:13.696
No.

10:14.655 --> 10:16.991
Because this motherfucker fucked it up!

10:20.369 --> 10:21.621
Chien?

10:22.288 --> 10:24.040
-You know him?

10:27.043 --> 10:29.712
Glen, is it really necessary
for her to pitch you?

10:29.795 --> 10:34.091
No, no. This is good. I want you both
to feel like this is a smart investment.

10:34.175 --> 10:36.260
-These are your financial projections?
-Yes.

10:36.344 --> 10:39.347
Plus balance sheets,
income statements, and cash flow

10:39.430 --> 10:41.182
for the past three years all in here.

10:41.265 --> 10:44.727
-Oh wow, look at you, business lady.

10:46.270 --> 10:48.105
This isn't gap-compliant.

10:48.189 --> 10:52.652
-Why aren't you using accrual accounting?
-Glen, she's not a Wharton MBA.

10:53.903 --> 10:57.740
We're a small business.
So, cash basis makes it easier to plan.

11:00.117 --> 11:02.495
If the numbers are solid,
why not go to a bank?

11:04.580 --> 11:05.456
Um…

11:06.916 --> 11:08.376
My dad, he…

11:08.459 --> 11:11.837
took out a bunch of credit cards
under my name and fucked up my credit.

11:11.921 --> 11:12.797
Hmm…

11:12.880 --> 11:16.092
The only way to clear it,
would be to press charges against him.

11:16.801 --> 11:20.596
-I'm just not really ready to do that.
-Is he still drinking?

11:21.972 --> 11:27.311
One time, he went into the court
in a game and beat up the mascot.

11:27.395 --> 11:29.522
-It was a dragon.

11:29.605 --> 11:31.816
We were disqualified from finals.

11:32.483 --> 11:35.319
Oh, but that's like, no reflection
on you or anything.

11:35.403 --> 11:37.697
It's these types of things
that make us stronger.

11:39.198 --> 11:42.243
Right. Um, I'm gonna use
your restroom quickly.

11:42.326 --> 11:44.537
-Okay.
-Uh, where is it?

11:45.121 --> 11:47.832
There's one in every corner.
You'll find it.

11:47.915 --> 11:48.749
Okay.

11:54.672 --> 11:56.507
Look, Dante…

11:57.216 --> 12:00.010
as a fully-limbed, able-body individual,

12:00.094 --> 12:02.138
I can't speak
to what it's like to lose a leg.

12:02.221 --> 12:03.222
It's brutal, bro.

12:04.014 --> 12:04.974
Okay?

12:05.057 --> 12:07.852
I ain't got no foot.
And yet my foot itches.

12:08.477 --> 12:09.770
Explain that shit!

12:09.854 --> 12:14.608
I get it. Sometimes I don't have a phone
in my pocket, but I feel the vibrations.

12:15.359 --> 12:17.570
It's completely different situation,
obviously.

12:23.075 --> 12:26.120
Maybe I should chop off his foot
so he knows how I feel.

12:28.080 --> 12:30.166
Bobo, get the saw.

12:30.249 --> 12:32.168
No, Bobo don't get the saw, Bobo.

12:32.251 --> 12:33.544
Or just take a pinky!

12:34.253 --> 12:36.464
You don't wear pinky rings anyway.

12:36.547 --> 12:41.010
Look, just take all the watches, bro.
All of them. And let's call that even.

12:42.636 --> 12:45.598
You think my foot is worth
a bunch of fake watches?

12:46.223 --> 12:48.809
They're high-end replicas.
Only the trained eye--

12:48.893 --> 12:50.311
I want justice!

12:50.394 --> 12:53.314
-Get it from the guy who shot you!
-Oh, I did.

12:54.482 --> 12:56.358
And I got a souvenir off of it.

12:58.194 --> 13:00.404
Dipped and dyed in his blood.

13:07.661 --> 13:10.873
Look at your face, man.
This doesn't even look like blood, bro.

13:10.956 --> 13:11.999
Yeah.

13:12.875 --> 13:14.543
But, I killed him though.

13:16.587 --> 13:17.421
Real slow.

13:22.676 --> 13:25.346
There has to be a way
to talk about this.

13:25.429 --> 13:26.639
Yo, boss!

13:26.722 --> 13:31.227
How about I untie you
and throw you at them, and I run?

13:31.894 --> 13:32.728
Maria?

13:33.646 --> 13:36.357
-Who's Maria? Your girl?
-My massage therapist.

13:36.440 --> 13:37.358
Oh, really?

13:37.441 --> 13:39.652
No, my massage therapist.
I got a crick in my neck--

13:39.735 --> 13:41.612
Maybe I should answer.
You look tense.

13:41.695 --> 13:43.823
Go ahead. She'll help you out.

13:43.906 --> 13:46.200
-Let me get this off. Is that cool?

13:46.283 --> 13:48.994
-He's not going anywhere. He's tied up.
-Hey…

13:49.995 --> 13:51.455
You're diabetic?

13:52.790 --> 13:53.707
Yeah. So?

13:54.625 --> 13:56.752
A diabetic with a foot injury?

13:56.836 --> 13:59.380
Yo, that's a legit comorbidity, man.

13:59.463 --> 14:03.884
That means it requires serious aftercare.
Come on, how was I supposed to know?

14:03.968 --> 14:05.302
You should've asked, Doctor.

14:05.386 --> 14:08.305
What kind of practice
do you think I'm running here?

14:08.389 --> 14:10.683
I don't have intake forms
for you to fill out.

14:10.766 --> 14:13.561
Yeah, he's right.
Look, I have a walnut allergy.

14:13.644 --> 14:16.730
If I go to a restaurant,
I don't tell the waiter I have an allergy,

14:16.814 --> 14:20.359
and he brings me a salad with walnuts,
I won't go back and shoot the waiter.

14:20.442 --> 14:21.277
Exactly.

14:21.360 --> 14:24.446
-Shut the fuck up.
-Shut the fuck up. What's wrong with you?

14:24.530 --> 14:28.200
Him not asking about
your diabetes can't be a capital offense.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.995
Look, Chien has a business.

14:31.787 --> 14:34.957
Why don't you take 10%
over the next two years.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.834
-He'll pay you monthly.
-No, what?

14:38.711 --> 14:40.880
-Three years. 15%.
-Deal.

14:40.963 --> 14:43.257
Plus a piece of your business. Same terms.

14:43.340 --> 14:44.925
Man, fuck that!

14:49.555 --> 14:50.723
Uh…

14:52.224 --> 14:53.726
Just saying it's not fair.

14:53.809 --> 14:56.770
Oh, you think you're working
some kind of harmless hustle?

14:57.313 --> 14:59.815
Ripping off Rolex or Versace?

14:59.899 --> 15:03.277
Hmm? That fake shit is made
by kids in sweatshops

15:03.360 --> 15:05.821
owned by gangsters way worse than me.

15:06.322 --> 15:11.160
Man, you're wearing sweatshop shit,
he is, I am. We're all sweat shopping it!

15:12.995 --> 15:15.205
-What's your girl's name?
-Shanice.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.041
Maria.

15:17.124 --> 15:20.920
No, man, I told you. Maria is
my massage therapist. It's Shanice.

15:21.003 --> 15:22.755
Chien, you know that bitch?

15:25.174 --> 15:27.343
-This is bullshit.
-Hey…

15:27.426 --> 15:30.346
In this country,
you're either one or the other.

15:30.930 --> 15:31.931
And I'm the bull.

15:49.865 --> 15:50.783
<i>Maria.</i>

15:50.866 --> 15:52.076
We've been talking.

15:52.576 --> 15:56.080
And it's clear how much
hard work you've put into this.

15:56.830 --> 15:58.332
And we'd love to help you out.

15:59.750 --> 16:00.584
Really?

16:01.210 --> 16:04.797
You don't have to do this right away.
I can show you more financials--

16:04.880 --> 16:05.756
We're sure.

16:06.882 --> 16:10.511
Thank you.
Thank you so much. Oh, my God.

16:10.594 --> 16:11.887
Thank you.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.348
Thank you. Oh. Well. Dab.

16:15.140 --> 16:17.977
We haven't discussed terms,
but I'm ready to pay market price.

16:18.060 --> 16:21.188
Stop. We're just so happy
to help someone like you.

16:24.817 --> 16:25.651
Thank you.

16:27.069 --> 16:29.905
And I'll draw up
a repayment schedule ASAP.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.907
In the meantime, if you need anything,

16:31.991 --> 16:34.743
anything at all,
please let me know. I mean it.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.620
Actually, there is something.

16:57.099 --> 16:59.393
Hey, babe. I'm so sorry I'm late.

17:00.394 --> 17:01.353
How did it go?

17:03.063 --> 17:04.982
-They're lending me the money.
-What?

17:06.442 --> 17:07.693
-Amazing. See?
-Yes.

17:07.776 --> 17:11.238
-Business speaks for itself.
-It does. It happened so fast.

17:12.156 --> 17:14.658
-"Thanks for popping by."
-Oh, you like that?

17:14.742 --> 17:16.118
I made it up myself.

17:16.201 --> 17:18.537
Oh, my gosh. These look amazing.

17:18.620 --> 17:22.541
When you're done, can you go around
the bathrooms and light scented candles?

17:22.624 --> 17:25.294
Thank you so much.
You're a lifesaver. Talk soon. Bye.

17:26.920 --> 17:30.257
She has you packaging popcorn
and refreshing bathrooms? What's that?

17:30.340 --> 17:31.967
They let me borrow a 100k.

17:32.760 --> 17:34.845
I can help a little bit with her party.

17:34.928 --> 17:37.931
If you get a loan at Chase Bank,
you don't clean floors and dishes.

17:38.015 --> 17:40.267
Can you just be happy for me, please?

17:41.393 --> 17:43.937
I'm sorry.
I've just been really stressed out.

17:44.021 --> 17:45.355
-Why?

17:45.439 --> 17:46.315
What happened?

17:46.398 --> 17:52.446
Nothing. Sameer. Meow Munch is going
out of business, and he's hysterical.

17:56.366 --> 17:59.495
You know they got a zoo?
I saw some anorexic raccoons.

17:59.995 --> 18:01.205
They're lemurs.

18:02.164 --> 18:03.082
Oh.

18:16.762 --> 18:18.555
Like my lemurs, Mo?

18:19.139 --> 18:22.976
Yeah, if I had your crypto money,
I'd probably get a tiger or something.

18:23.060 --> 18:25.437
Nah, lemurs are an endangered species.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.481
Pretty much refugees.

18:30.192 --> 18:32.444
How's that reggae band going, Greg?

18:32.528 --> 18:34.863
We play the blues. And it's Glen.

18:35.697 --> 18:38.492
Oh, you do? I wasn't sure
on which appropriation it was.

18:38.575 --> 18:42.204
Well, we have a Black bassist,
so it's not really appropriation.

18:42.287 --> 18:44.081
I'm just busting balls, Greg.

18:45.415 --> 18:49.128
-Glen. Maria's business is thriving, huh?
-Oh, man. She's killing it.

18:49.628 --> 18:51.296
And she says you're…

18:52.005 --> 18:53.340
picking olives now.

18:56.009 --> 18:59.263
I'm just glad we could help her out
since you couldn't.

19:00.013 --> 19:00.848
Yeah.

19:03.183 --> 19:06.353
Let me ask you something. You have money
but can't afford a nice watch?

19:06.937 --> 19:08.021
This is a Rolex.

19:08.105 --> 19:10.691
Yeah, you wish it was a Rolex.
It's a fake.

19:11.316 --> 19:14.987
Could've gotten you a better deal
on a Harwin. It rattles, chrome-plated,

19:15.070 --> 19:18.574
It's not even sweeping. It's not even on.
It's not even kinetic energy.

19:18.657 --> 19:21.660
-Get out of here. You got duped.
-It came with a certificate.

19:21.743 --> 19:25.164
How about I get you a certificate?
Says certified asshole on there.

19:25.831 --> 19:27.332
P.S. Go fuck yourself.

19:27.416 --> 19:31.420
Yeah, all right. I'll go fuck myself.
In my six-million-dollar house.

19:32.004 --> 19:34.131
-Don't touch my lemurs.
-Don't touch me.

19:34.214 --> 19:35.924
Why don't you go fuck your sheep?

19:37.759 --> 19:38.886
…at our anniversary.

19:38.969 --> 19:43.682
They need so much strength to hit balls.
How do you train for something like that?

19:43.765 --> 19:45.893
I play libero. I play the back line.

19:45.976 --> 19:47.644
-Right
-You're setter, a digger--

19:47.728 --> 19:50.564
Maria, can you check
on the tomato puffs for me?

19:52.065 --> 19:53.650
I'll let you know my guy.

19:57.571 --> 19:59.323
That dish is so finicky.

20:08.874 --> 20:13.003
Oh, my God. You read my mind.
Thank you.

20:14.630 --> 20:15.589
Mmm.

20:16.632 --> 20:18.425
Just like old times, isn't it?

20:18.508 --> 20:21.845
Maria, the boss lady
and Shila hosting parties.

20:22.679 --> 20:25.224
Except I'm not shitfaced
in the bathroom. Yet.

20:29.686 --> 20:30.562
You okay?

20:32.439 --> 20:33.482
Yeah.

20:34.441 --> 20:37.110
I just thought back there, you…

20:37.194 --> 20:40.447
tell me in front of your friends
to check on the oven was kind of…

20:41.657 --> 20:43.533
Asking you to check on the puffs?

20:44.284 --> 20:45.786
In front of your friends.

20:46.370 --> 20:49.331
I'm sorry. I didn't want
to pull you aside to have a conversation

20:49.414 --> 20:50.832
about checking on the puffs.

20:50.916 --> 20:52.542
They could've burned.

20:52.626 --> 20:55.170
t's not just the puffs.
It's… the condescension.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.798
You know, like, "She's not a Wharton MBA."

20:58.840 --> 21:01.343
-But, you're not.
-I'm not dumb either.

21:01.426 --> 21:05.013
Sometimes it feels
like you treat me like your charity case.

21:05.097 --> 21:10.560
I'm sorry. But you came,
asked me for money so I gave it to you.

21:10.644 --> 21:14.189
I didn't ask you for money.
Shila, I asked you to invest with me.

21:14.273 --> 21:17.150
I'm not trying to make money off of you.
I don't need your money.

21:17.234 --> 21:19.987
I… was trying to be a kind-hearted person.

21:20.070 --> 21:22.614
Like you're donating
to your cleaning lady?

21:25.158 --> 21:27.077
Oh, my God.

21:27.703 --> 21:30.163
I'm sorry I asked you
to check on the puffs, okay?

21:32.040 --> 21:35.919
-I didn't know you'd develop a complex.
-It's not just the puffs, okay?

21:36.003 --> 21:39.339
It's you giving me hand-me-downs.
Never letting me pay for my own stuff.

21:39.423 --> 21:41.591
Well, excuse me for trying to be nice.

21:41.675 --> 21:44.928
Being nice is buying me dinner
on my birthday. Okay?

21:45.012 --> 21:47.347
Not treating me like I'm on welfare.

21:47.431 --> 21:50.058
But it's nice to show up here
and treat me like a fucking bank?

21:50.142 --> 21:52.978
Shila, what's Jerry's number?
I can't find it anywhere.

21:53.061 --> 21:55.731
-Call Jerry. Get your 15k back.
-What's going on?

21:55.814 --> 21:59.067
-Eric Trump bought a fake Rolex.
-It's not. Jerry is a reputable jeweler.

21:59.151 --> 22:02.279
Sweetie, it's fine. He doesn't know
what a real one looks like.

22:02.362 --> 22:05.282
If he could, Maria wouldn't be here
begging us for money.

22:05.365 --> 22:08.410
<i>Pendeja</i>, keep your money.
Find another minority to donate to.

22:08.493 --> 22:10.871
What? Bitch, I'm Indian!

22:11.705 --> 22:14.458
-You haven't been Indian since 2009.

22:14.541 --> 22:17.294
And you. I hope lemurs sneak up on you
in the middle of the night

22:17.377 --> 22:19.296
and just gang bang your ear.

22:21.214 --> 22:24.301
And you have little lemur babies
sprouting from your earholes.

22:24.384 --> 22:25.260
Piece of shit.

22:27.012 --> 22:28.972
You're the most Indian person
I know, babe.

22:33.101 --> 22:34.478
That's how they all see me.

22:35.562 --> 22:39.649
Low-class, secondhand-everything,
Mexican girl who's never gonna do shit.

22:41.068 --> 22:43.695
-I got a place to take you.
-Can we just go home? Please.

22:43.779 --> 22:46.114
It's peaceful,
and it'll change the whole vibe.

22:46.198 --> 22:48.325
Here's some popcorn. Gonna be a long ride.

22:49.659 --> 22:52.245
-You stole their popcorn?
-It's party favors.

22:54.956 --> 22:56.458
Everybody takes party favors.

23:11.807 --> 23:12.974
It's beautiful, right?

23:14.893 --> 23:18.605
You know what I see when I see this?
A little piece of home in Houston.

23:18.688 --> 23:21.024
-Houston's not home?
-Of course, Houston is.

23:21.108 --> 23:23.026
I have another home I can't go to yet.

23:25.362 --> 23:27.364
You know you're living the dream?

23:27.447 --> 23:29.950
You're doing what you love.
You have your own business.

23:30.033 --> 23:32.911
-Fucking killing it.
-Just doesn't feel that way.

23:32.994 --> 23:35.414
Why? Because your dad screwed you over?

23:35.497 --> 23:37.707
Because Shila's of the world don't see it?

23:37.791 --> 23:39.251
Fuck them. I see it.

23:40.210 --> 23:41.294
You're amazing.

23:43.213 --> 23:45.715
Strong-ass woman
running your own business.

23:46.216 --> 23:47.092
I love you.

23:48.009 --> 23:49.719
You understand? Come here.

23:56.643 --> 24:00.147
-Imagine the life we could have together.
-A life with kids.

24:00.647 --> 24:02.357
Of course, your Mexican, I'm Palestinian,

24:02.441 --> 24:05.610
biologically impossible
not to have at least six kids.

24:05.694 --> 24:09.322
Have a big ass house. No zoo though.
I'm not buying you a fucking zoo.

24:09.406 --> 24:11.908
Just a big enough house for the kids,
my mom and brother.

24:11.992 --> 24:14.077
-They're gonna live with us?
-Of course.

24:14.161 --> 24:16.830
No, no, no, don't go.
You ain't going anywhere.

24:17.497 --> 24:19.708
No, you can't get away from me, no.

24:20.625 --> 24:23.253
Yeah, you'd be out there
selling slabs and shit.

24:23.336 --> 24:25.505
My mom and my brother
would help with the kids.

24:26.006 --> 24:28.717
-I'll be the GM of the Houston Rockets.
-When?

24:30.218 --> 24:31.928
I have to work my way up
in the organization.

24:32.012 --> 24:34.639
-Probably start off scouting.
-No, I mean the family.

24:35.182 --> 24:36.016
When?

24:37.100 --> 24:38.143
Soon.

24:38.643 --> 24:39.561
You promise?

24:40.729 --> 24:41.605
Of course.

24:42.314 --> 24:43.148
I got you.

24:54.493 --> 24:57.621
-Is this a two-step? I don't even--
-I don't know what you're doing.

25:10.091 --> 25:12.719
I’m getting tired.
Shouldn’t someone be here?

25:12.802 --> 25:15.347
Let’s get out of here
before someone sees us. Come on.

25:15.430 --> 25:17.557
<i>Vámonos, más rápido. Vámonos.</i>
