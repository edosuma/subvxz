WEBVTT

00:01.568 --> 00:02.402
DOLE: Previously
on "The Practice"...

00:02.435 --> 00:04.137
I never thought
I'd have an affair.

00:04.170 --> 00:06.973
We're having dinner.
Like you say, innocent.

00:08.308 --> 00:10.511
This is getting more
dangerous than I want it to.

00:10.544 --> 00:12.813
I agree.
It's best we stop now

00:12.846 --> 00:14.480
before it does get
too dangerous.

00:14.948 --> 00:15.782
Bye.

00:23.657 --> 00:25.291
DOLE: You're the father
of my child.

00:25.325 --> 00:26.693
You're my husband.

00:26.727 --> 00:29.329
Beyond that,
I don't trust you.

00:29.362 --> 00:32.131
I've taken Bobby Jr.
to my parents.

00:32.165 --> 00:33.534
What are you talking about?

00:33.567 --> 00:34.601
I'm leaving you.

00:37.170 --> 00:40.140
I was date-raped once,
four years ago.

00:40.173 --> 00:41.542
I didn't report it.

00:41.575 --> 00:43.476
Well, did you go to
counseling for this or--

00:43.510 --> 00:45.478
I'm past it now,
but thank you.

00:45.512 --> 00:46.913
This is something
you need to deal with.

00:46.947 --> 00:48.148
I did deal with it.

00:48.181 --> 00:49.449
I moved on.

00:50.283 --> 00:52.586
Tell me why I shouldn't
report you for stalking.

00:52.619 --> 00:54.387
I just couldn't leave
on bad terms.

00:54.420 --> 00:56.723
You saved my life.

00:56.757 --> 00:59.259
I would do anything
to either repay you or--

00:59.292 --> 01:00.501
DOLE: See this woman?

01:00.534 --> 01:02.035
She's my best friend.

01:02.068 --> 01:04.069
And this man is on the loose,

01:04.104 --> 01:05.572
a threat to her life.

01:05.606 --> 01:06.740
You came into my life

01:06.773 --> 01:09.543
because I'm a criminal
defense lawyer doing my job.

01:09.576 --> 01:12.946
We wanna do our jobs
and then be left alone.

01:12.979 --> 01:14.114
(doorbell rings)

01:15.782 --> 01:16.550
Can I help you?

01:16.583 --> 01:19.252
Special delivery for...

01:19.285 --> 01:20.721
Russell Bakey.

01:29.295 --> 01:30.130
What have you heard?

01:30.163 --> 01:32.899
Only that, that they split.

01:32.933 --> 01:34.100
You hear anything more?

01:34.134 --> 01:35.736
No. He's not talking.

01:35.769 --> 01:36.670
What a switch.

01:36.703 --> 01:38.505
Listen to you gossipmongers.

01:38.539 --> 01:40.406
You just can't get enough,
can you?

01:40.440 --> 01:42.042
It's hardly gossip,
Rebecca. It--

01:42.075 --> 01:44.410
Yes, it is. You're huddled
like a pack of rats,

01:44.444 --> 01:45.746
whispering like
it's something delicious.

01:45.779 --> 01:47.347
You know, why don't we just
throw a big party?

01:47.380 --> 01:48.481
"Lindsay and Bobby are split.

01:48.515 --> 01:50.717
Wheel in the floats.
Isn't it rich?"

01:51.985 --> 01:53.486
HATCHER: Can I help you?

01:53.520 --> 01:55.656
I'm looking
for Jamie Stringer.

01:55.689 --> 01:56.823
That's me.

02:00.400 --> 02:02.603
I am here under
the heading of...

02:02.636 --> 02:05.071
"It's an extremely
small world."

02:05.105 --> 02:07.007
I guess that's
abstract enough.

02:07.040 --> 02:08.741
You created some buzz
in my office

02:08.775 --> 02:09.743
a couple of weeks ago

02:09.776 --> 02:11.277
when you established
rape victims

02:11.311 --> 02:13.279
as a class in employment
discrimination.

02:13.313 --> 02:16.316
It was a motion to dismiss.
I hardly established--

02:16.349 --> 02:18.151
Even so, you potentially

02:18.184 --> 02:20.320
took the law
to a new place.

02:20.353 --> 02:21.755
You're to be saluted.

02:22.556 --> 02:24.991
Something tells me
you're not here to salute.

02:25.592 --> 02:26.960
No.

02:28.361 --> 02:30.531
I'm a district attorney.

02:30.564 --> 02:34.200
I'm prosecuting a man
named Randall Pyne

02:34.234 --> 02:35.368
for date rape.

02:36.870 --> 02:38.539
Does that name ring a bell?

02:40.974 --> 02:42.543
The buzz you created
stirred a memory

02:42.576 --> 02:43.944
with one of my assistants.

02:43.977 --> 02:47.914
Our investigation previously
unearthed your name

02:47.948 --> 02:49.382
in connection with Mr. Pyne.

02:49.415 --> 02:50.784
It never really went
anywhere,

02:50.817 --> 02:52.519
just rumors that
you had a history

02:52.553 --> 02:54.187
with this man.

02:54.220 --> 02:55.288
Is that true?

02:56.857 --> 02:57.958
I may have.

02:59.726 --> 03:02.736
His trial starts tomorrow,

03:02.769 --> 03:05.071
and, simply put...

03:05.105 --> 03:07.373
if this man raped you,

03:07.407 --> 03:08.909
I need you.

03:08.942 --> 03:10.577
The victim in my case
was drugged.

03:10.611 --> 03:11.377
Her memory--

03:11.411 --> 03:12.813
You can't introduce prior--

03:12.846 --> 03:14.781
In this case I can,
to show pattern.

03:14.815 --> 03:18.018
I already beat a motion
in limine on another witness,

03:18.051 --> 03:21.688
another woman he date-raped,

03:21.722 --> 03:23.657
a witness who just fell out.

03:26.426 --> 03:27.794
I need you, Ms. Stringer.

03:31.431 --> 03:35.335
First of all, my memory
would be just as shaky as--

03:35.368 --> 03:36.670
I can deal with that.

03:36.703 --> 03:38.539
And second...

03:39.272 --> 03:40.507
I'm listening.

03:40.541 --> 03:43.376
Look, I just don't want
to do it, okay?

03:43.710 --> 03:45.178
And second?

03:45.712 --> 03:47.681
See this suit, Ms. Atkins?

03:47.714 --> 03:49.282
Eighteen hundred dollars.

03:49.315 --> 03:50.917
Way more than I can afford.

03:50.951 --> 03:52.753
I bought it anyway
because my image

03:52.786 --> 03:54.588
is very important to me.

03:54.621 --> 03:57.524
What becomes of that image
if I take the stand

03:57.558 --> 03:59.125
to declare I was date-raped,

03:59.159 --> 04:01.167
to have the defense
attorney pick through

04:01.201 --> 04:02.936
my past like, uh--

04:06.239 --> 04:07.741
I'm not a nun.

04:07.774 --> 04:09.042
Trust me.

04:10.343 --> 04:13.580
That's a beautiful suit

04:13.614 --> 04:16.216
but I'm not going to get him

04:16.249 --> 04:18.184
without your help.

04:21.555 --> 04:23.089
Now, I haven't
even gotten to the

04:23.123 --> 04:25.158
"It's a really small
world" part.

04:25.191 --> 04:27.160
The rapist...

04:27.193 --> 04:30.030
his defense attorney
is Eugene Young.

04:33.199 --> 04:35.201
(music playing)

05:23.356 --> 05:24.691
Jamie, you can't do this.

05:24.725 --> 05:25.659
I already agreed.

05:25.692 --> 05:26.527
You'll all get the amend--

05:26.560 --> 05:27.728
I'm the man's attorney.

05:27.761 --> 05:28.895
And I am a witness.

05:28.929 --> 05:30.797
You should probably
recuse yourself.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.198
On the day of trial?
You got to be kidding.

05:32.232 --> 05:33.066
HATCHER: Eugene...

05:33.099 --> 05:34.535
Don't start with your
stuff now, okay?

05:34.568 --> 05:35.536
My stuff?

05:35.569 --> 05:36.670
Your testimony wouldn't
even be admissible--

05:36.703 --> 05:38.839
What stuff do I have?
All right.

05:38.872 --> 05:40.907
It goes to pattern (indistinct)
It is so prejudicial--

05:40.941 --> 05:41.742
Leave her alone, Eugene.

05:41.775 --> 05:43.810
Hey, you think
I want to do this?

05:43.844 --> 05:44.711
Then why do it if you
don't wanna do it?

05:44.745 --> 05:46.179
Because your client
is a rapist.

05:46.212 --> 05:47.548
Our client, Jamie,
you're a member of this firm.

05:47.581 --> 05:50.216
He's our client.
And I was one of his victims.

05:50.250 --> 05:51.985
HATCHER: He is not her client,

05:52.018 --> 05:54.120
and if you want to recuse
yourself, do it.

05:54.154 --> 05:55.622
But she already said yes,

05:55.656 --> 05:57.257
and what you're doing
now comes close

05:57.290 --> 05:58.692
to intimidating a witness.

06:03.303 --> 06:05.639
If there's anything I can do

06:05.672 --> 06:08.909
or help with your son--

06:08.942 --> 06:10.210
I appreciate that.

06:12.345 --> 06:15.816
So you--you're living
with your parents for now?

06:15.849 --> 06:18.118
Until I find
my own place, yes.

06:19.820 --> 06:21.588
So you're looking
for a place?

06:21.622 --> 06:23.724
Yes, Claire.
It's that serious.

06:23.757 --> 06:25.526
I'm looking for my own place.

06:25.559 --> 06:26.426
STANLEY: Hi, Lindsay.

06:29.530 --> 06:30.430
Hello, Claire.

06:31.632 --> 06:34.300
DOLE: Stanley,
what are you doing here?

06:34.334 --> 06:36.637
It's not bad news, I promise.

06:36.670 --> 06:39.573
In fact, it's wonderful news.

06:41.708 --> 06:44.578
I think I've turned
my life around.

06:45.646 --> 06:47.681
Really? How?

06:50.150 --> 06:51.117
This is for you.

06:51.151 --> 06:52.786
What is it?

06:52.819 --> 06:56.456
A check for services rendered.

06:56.823 --> 07:00.433
I got a job.

07:00.466 --> 07:02.836
I'm leading
a normal life, Lindsay.

07:04.070 --> 07:06.006
I owe it all to you.

07:06.039 --> 07:09.275
A job? Wow.

07:09.309 --> 07:11.477
What do you do?

07:12.946 --> 07:14.581
I'm a substitute
high-school teacher,

07:14.615 --> 07:17.017
and I love it.

07:17.050 --> 07:18.752
You're teaching high school?

07:18.785 --> 07:20.554
It'll take me a year
to get certified,

07:20.587 --> 07:23.489
but I can teach
in the meantime.

07:23.524 --> 07:25.592
Don't they do background checks?
I mean, uh...

07:25.626 --> 07:28.995
DOLE: Stanley, uh,
I don't know about this.

07:29.530 --> 07:31.698
I'm happy.

07:31.732 --> 07:33.800
And I have both of you to thank.

07:33.834 --> 07:36.002
Even so--
STANLEY: It's wonderful.

07:39.339 --> 07:41.842
How's your friend,
by the way?

07:41.875 --> 07:43.209
Is she better now?

07:43.243 --> 07:44.811
What friend?

07:44.845 --> 07:46.212
The one in the newspaper.

07:46.246 --> 07:47.447
Remember, you showed me
her picture.

07:47.480 --> 07:49.149
She was being terrorized

07:49.182 --> 07:52.586
by that awful man, Mr. Bakey.

07:52.619 --> 07:53.854
Is she feeling better?

07:54.454 --> 07:55.622
Why?

07:55.656 --> 07:57.423
I'm just curious.

07:58.491 --> 08:00.400
You seemed so concerned.

08:02.068 --> 08:04.137
I was hoping things got better.

08:05.238 --> 08:09.175
(music playing)

08:13.179 --> 08:15.381
What do you mean
you're getting out?

08:15.415 --> 08:16.449
I have to. She's a witness

08:16.482 --> 08:17.651
and member of my firm.

08:17.684 --> 08:19.452
May--maybe that's why
they're calling her,

08:19.485 --> 08:20.887
to conflict you out.

08:20.921 --> 08:21.888
I thought of that.

08:21.922 --> 08:23.590
The problem
is I can't prove it, so--

08:23.624 --> 08:25.325
It's the day of trial.

08:25.358 --> 08:27.493
I'm sorry.

08:27.528 --> 08:29.195
I don't know what else
to tell you.

08:31.131 --> 08:32.698
You're trying this case.
Your Honor--

08:32.732 --> 08:34.000
KITTLESON:
If you were coming in here

08:34.034 --> 08:35.669
with the client's consent,

08:35.702 --> 08:37.303
that would be one thing,
but without it--

08:37.337 --> 08:38.539
Your Honor,
this witness is--

08:38.572 --> 08:40.073
It's conflict.

08:40.106 --> 08:41.775
I get it.

08:41.808 --> 08:43.275
But it's not prohibitive.

08:43.308 --> 08:44.945
I'm telling you, it is.

08:44.978 --> 08:46.346
This is a rape case.
I will have--I mean--

08:46.379 --> 08:49.282
Eugene, you get my sympathy,

08:49.315 --> 08:51.685
but that is all
you are getting.

08:55.488 --> 08:58.424
Will you be able to do
your job?

08:58.458 --> 09:00.300
I mean, you're not gonna
hold back now, are you?

09:01.568 --> 09:03.236
Let's talk about
Jamie Stringer.

09:03.269 --> 09:04.705
It was consensual.

09:04.738 --> 09:06.239
Was she drugged?

09:06.272 --> 09:09.042
We both took ludes
and drank some wine,

09:09.075 --> 09:10.944
(chuckles)
but we were both into it.

09:10.977 --> 09:13.046
I know that.
You're sure?

09:13.079 --> 09:14.648
I mean, this happened
four years ago.

09:14.681 --> 09:15.716
You're positive?

09:15.749 --> 09:17.551
I remember Jamie Stringer
very well.

09:17.584 --> 09:19.920
She was very aggressive, Eugene.

09:19.953 --> 09:21.722
It's one of the reasons
I took the lude.

09:21.755 --> 09:23.223
She intimidated me a little.

09:23.256 --> 09:25.926
I--look, uh,

09:25.959 --> 09:28.562
I thought you said prior rapes
couldn't be admitted.

09:28.595 --> 09:30.463
Well, date rapes can.
They go to pattern.

09:30.496 --> 09:32.232
The good, old-fashioned
rape by force,

09:32.265 --> 09:33.333
they're suppressed.

09:33.366 --> 09:34.801
Unless I testify.

09:34.835 --> 09:36.637
Which you won't
in this lifetime.

09:37.804 --> 09:40.240
Jamie Stringer was into it,
trust me.

09:40.273 --> 09:41.975
Trust you?

09:42.475 --> 09:45.812
Are you going to hold back?

09:49.349 --> 09:52.452
Yes. Uh, thank you very much.

09:54.020 --> 09:55.288
Unbelievable.

09:55.321 --> 09:57.190
What?

09:57.223 --> 09:59.325
I just got off with
the human resources division

09:59.359 --> 10:01.467
of the Boston School District.

10:01.502 --> 10:03.870
Not only do they not
do investigations

10:03.904 --> 10:06.472
of new teachers,
but get this,

10:07.107 --> 10:08.809
an arrest for murder

10:08.842 --> 10:10.376
wouldn't preclude
employment.

10:10.410 --> 10:13.113
Only convictions
disqualify applicants.

10:13.146 --> 10:16.116
Uh, Lindsay...

10:16.149 --> 10:19.319
that man is teaching
high-school girls.

10:19.352 --> 10:21.722
He befriends high-school girls.

10:21.755 --> 10:23.924
Do they know
he was arrested for murder?

10:23.957 --> 10:26.560
I doubt it, but I didn't
give anything away.

10:29.696 --> 10:32.265
I think it's time to give
some things away.

10:32.298 --> 10:33.600
We can't.

10:35.669 --> 10:37.270
The arrest is public record.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.506
It isn't privileged
or confidential.

10:41.041 --> 10:42.442
Find out where he teaches.

10:45.779 --> 10:49.015
I remember drinking
the wine

10:49.049 --> 10:52.285
in a bar
then feeling groggy.

10:52.819 --> 10:54.588
The next thing,
I'm in his apartment,

10:54.621 --> 10:58.324
and he's on top of me,
inside of me.

10:58.358 --> 11:00.366
And when I woke up
a few hours later...

11:01.602 --> 11:02.636
I knew.

11:02.669 --> 11:04.538
ATKINS: Okay.

11:04.571 --> 11:06.472
After you woke up,
what did you do then?

11:06.507 --> 11:08.675
I left his apartment,
and I went to a hospital

11:08.709 --> 11:10.343
to get checked out.

11:10.376 --> 11:11.812
They did the rape kit.

11:11.845 --> 11:13.880
Do you know what
conclusions they reached?

11:13.914 --> 11:15.348
That I'd been raped.

11:16.216 --> 11:18.051
They also
did a blood test and--

11:20.053 --> 11:21.688
What did the blood test reveal?

11:22.288 --> 11:24.257
They found traces of GHB.

11:24.290 --> 11:25.559
GHB?

11:25.592 --> 11:28.929
Gamma hydroxybutyric acid,

11:28.962 --> 11:30.430
the date-rape drug.

11:31.497 --> 11:33.299
Actually,
the medical conclusion

11:33.333 --> 11:36.469
was only that you'd
had sexual intercourse.

11:36.503 --> 11:37.638
There was bruising,
and I was--

11:37.671 --> 11:39.806
YOUNG: The doctor's conclusion

11:39.840 --> 11:41.274
was that you had intercourse.

11:41.307 --> 11:44.210
Based on your claim
that it was nonconsensual,

11:44.244 --> 11:46.547
the assumption was then made

11:46.580 --> 11:49.650
that you'd been raped,
isn't that correct?

11:49.683 --> 11:50.917
Yes.

11:50.951 --> 11:52.819
And according
to your own statement,

11:52.853 --> 11:55.255
you don't even remember
when the intercourse began,

11:55.922 --> 11:57.257
isn't that correct?

11:57.290 --> 11:58.759
Yes.

11:58.792 --> 12:00.934
In fact,
you don't remember

12:00.967 --> 12:02.836
a large chunk
of that night, do you?

12:02.869 --> 12:04.605
Because he drugged me.

12:04.638 --> 12:06.106
You have a memory
of him drugging you?

12:06.139 --> 12:08.441
I have a memory
of drinking the wine.

12:08.474 --> 12:11.244
Well, initially,
you told the police

12:11.277 --> 12:12.913
you didn't remember
what you had to drink

12:12.946 --> 12:14.080
or how much.

12:14.114 --> 12:15.716
That was your statement,
wasn't it?

12:15.749 --> 12:18.184
I eventually remembered
drinking the wine,

12:18.218 --> 12:19.920
which he--
You eventually remembered?

12:19.953 --> 12:20.854
It was a first date.

12:20.887 --> 12:22.923
I would have never
had sex with him.

12:22.956 --> 12:25.792
You don't remember what you
had to drink or how much,

12:25.826 --> 12:27.728
true or false, Ms. Wilson?

12:27.761 --> 12:31.297
I know I drank wine.

12:31.331 --> 12:32.766
I don't know how much.

12:32.799 --> 12:34.267
Thank you.

12:35.802 --> 12:36.937
Nothing further.

12:39.072 --> 12:41.307
The Commonwealth calls
Jamie Stringer.

12:41.341 --> 12:42.543
YOUNG: Your Honor,
Ms. Stringer

12:42.576 --> 12:44.878
was just added to the list
this morning.

12:44.911 --> 12:46.780
We'd like to take
some time to prepare.

12:46.813 --> 12:47.981
How much time?

12:48.014 --> 12:49.215
We'd like to take the day.

12:49.249 --> 12:50.684
We'll break
until tomorrow morning

12:50.717 --> 12:53.053
and reconvene
with Ms. Stringer.

12:53.086 --> 12:53.920
Adjourned.

12:53.954 --> 12:54.788
(gavel bangs)

13:13.413 --> 13:15.281
You got me fired.

13:15.315 --> 13:17.150
You went to the school

13:17.183 --> 13:19.653
and you told them
privileged information.

13:19.686 --> 13:23.757
It wasn't privileged,
Stanley.

13:23.790 --> 13:25.926
I told them
that you'd been arrested

13:25.959 --> 13:27.393
and what the arrests were for.

13:27.427 --> 13:29.195
That was all public record.

13:29.229 --> 13:31.331
Why?

13:31.364 --> 13:32.999
Why did you do this to me?

13:33.667 --> 13:35.502
Because you kill young women,

13:35.536 --> 13:37.337
and I wasn't about
to sit quietly

13:37.370 --> 13:38.672
while you teach high school.

13:38.705 --> 13:39.873
You hurt me.

13:40.607 --> 13:42.776
I had a good job.

13:42.809 --> 13:44.177
Now, it's gone.

13:44.210 --> 13:46.312
You hurt me, Lindsay.

13:46.346 --> 13:47.781
Stanley--

13:47.814 --> 13:48.949
We're friends.

13:50.984 --> 13:52.786
It was you...

13:52.819 --> 13:56.923
who made me believe
in goodness again

13:56.957 --> 13:57.858
and...

14:01.401 --> 14:03.003
you're all I have.

14:04.971 --> 14:05.872
And now--

14:06.840 --> 14:09.142
Listen to me.

14:09.175 --> 14:12.513
Until you get mental help,

14:12.546 --> 14:15.248
you have no business
teaching in a school.

14:23.289 --> 14:25.526
You hurt me very badly.

14:34.901 --> 14:37.070
I don't like his current
frame of mind.

14:41.274 --> 14:43.677
STRINGER: No, I really
appreciate the call, I do.

14:43.710 --> 14:44.911
Thank you.

14:47.814 --> 14:48.782
What's wrong?

14:54.420 --> 14:56.256
You got a PI contacting
my friends,

14:56.289 --> 14:58.291
people I went to school with?

14:59.059 --> 15:00.934
You're investigating me?

15:00.967 --> 15:03.269
Jamie, you're a witness
for the prosecution.

15:03.303 --> 15:04.905
I don't know
what your plan is,

15:04.938 --> 15:06.372
but there
are rape shield laws.

15:06.406 --> 15:07.941
If you think you're going
to tear me up--

15:07.974 --> 15:09.576
Rape shield laws
protect victims,

15:09.610 --> 15:11.144
not witnesses.

15:11.177 --> 15:12.312
For the purpose of this trial,

15:12.345 --> 15:14.881
you're a witness,
and fair game.

15:20.721 --> 15:22.756
I'm begging you
not to take that stand.

15:23.857 --> 15:25.291
I say that as
Randall Pyne's attorney,

15:25.325 --> 15:27.227
but I also say it
because I care about you,

15:27.260 --> 15:29.596
and I don't wanna go
after you.

15:29.630 --> 15:30.964
But I have an ethical duty

15:30.997 --> 15:32.566
to do everything I can.

15:38.338 --> 15:39.873
Please, Jamie...

15:41.575 --> 15:43.209
don't get in that chair.

15:59.159 --> 16:00.834
Busy?
No.

16:00.867 --> 16:01.802
Come on in.

16:04.204 --> 16:05.105
How are you?

16:05.138 --> 16:07.340
Oh, uh, I'm fine.

16:07.874 --> 16:09.042
No, you're not.

16:10.811 --> 16:12.245
How could you be?

16:13.514 --> 16:15.215
How's Bobby Jr.?

16:16.449 --> 16:19.686
It's, um--it's gonna
take some time.

16:19.720 --> 16:20.887
We'll be okay.

16:22.623 --> 16:24.791
You need to hold on
to that thought.

16:27.761 --> 16:29.730
Anyway, uh, I just came
by to say hi

16:29.763 --> 16:30.697
and, um...

16:32.899 --> 16:35.201
hey, that Bakey guy,

16:35.235 --> 16:36.903
has he stopped bothering you?

16:36.937 --> 16:38.639
Yes. Thank God.

16:38.672 --> 16:41.141
Have you seen him,
or heard from him, or--

16:41.174 --> 16:42.743
No. Why?

16:42.776 --> 16:44.110
Just wondering.

16:44.144 --> 16:45.178
Will you do me a favor

16:45.211 --> 16:47.514
and check to see if...

16:47.548 --> 16:48.715
he's still alive?

16:49.482 --> 16:50.984
I beg your pardon?

16:51.451 --> 16:53.587
I know this is gonna
sound crazy.

16:53.620 --> 16:55.889
I have a client with,
uh, a violent past,

16:55.922 --> 16:57.490
and, uh,
I mentioned to him

16:57.524 --> 17:00.400
that Bakey
was harassing you.

17:00.433 --> 17:03.069
Yesterday, this client

17:03.103 --> 17:04.270
suggested something like,

17:04.304 --> 17:06.138
uh, I don't know, uh,

17:06.172 --> 17:08.473
the problem
was taken care of.

17:10.276 --> 17:12.613
You think your client
did something

17:12.646 --> 17:14.214
to Russell Bakey?

17:20.721 --> 17:22.321
He's dead all right.

17:22.355 --> 17:23.388
No kidding.

17:23.423 --> 17:26.059
I'll never get used
to that smell.

17:26.092 --> 17:28.060
OFFICER: Detective, up here.

17:31.097 --> 17:34.000
(water trickling)

17:44.344 --> 17:46.813
Lindsay Dole has quite
the client roster.

17:46.847 --> 17:50.784
(music playing)

17:55.255 --> 17:56.289
He's dead?

17:56.322 --> 17:59.325
They found him
in the bathtub.

17:59.359 --> 18:01.167
I just heard it
on the news.

18:02.335 --> 18:03.737
How did you know?

18:03.770 --> 18:07.473
The way Stanley said it,
I just had a feeling.

18:07.508 --> 18:08.842
He did it for you

18:10.143 --> 18:13.013
because Helen
was your friend.

18:13.046 --> 18:14.080
I mean, that's--
Thank you, Claire.

18:14.114 --> 18:15.682
That makes me feel
so much better.

18:15.716 --> 18:18.218
WYATT: I'm just saying

18:18.251 --> 18:21.421
I think he's totally
in love with you.

18:22.689 --> 18:24.190
You're like his angel.

18:25.258 --> 18:26.459
(door opens)

18:30.263 --> 18:32.098
I need a name.
Forget it.

18:32.132 --> 18:33.867
GAMBLE: Lindsay,
you've already led us

18:33.900 --> 18:36.002
to evidence
implicating him.

18:36.036 --> 18:37.538
I won't give you his name.

18:38.304 --> 18:39.405
For you to come to me

18:39.439 --> 18:42.375
offering anything,

18:42.408 --> 18:45.211
you must feel this man
is very dangerous.

18:47.013 --> 18:48.849
If this man killed Bakey

18:48.882 --> 18:50.150
because you mentioned me

18:50.183 --> 18:53.253
being threatened by him,

18:53.286 --> 18:56.356
Lindsay, it's not much
of a motive,

18:56.389 --> 18:59.526
which tells me this man
is probably crazy,

18:59.560 --> 19:01.868
which, again, I suspect

19:01.902 --> 19:04.004
is the reason you
came to me.

19:09.209 --> 19:11.812
If you want me
to do something,

19:11.845 --> 19:14.515
give me his name.

19:21.021 --> 19:22.022
Stanley Deeks.

19:22.055 --> 19:22.723
Lindsay!

19:23.790 --> 19:25.225
He killed the Burns girl.

19:25.258 --> 19:26.092
Lindsay!

19:27.260 --> 19:28.394
Here's the file.
Help yourself.

19:28.428 --> 19:30.196
This you don't want me
to have.

19:30.230 --> 19:31.264
I did give it to you, Helen.

19:31.297 --> 19:33.133
GAMBLE: You don't wanna do--
I did, Helen.

19:35.502 --> 19:36.637
Are you sure?

19:38.471 --> 19:39.740
This will bite you.

19:39.773 --> 19:41.675
I gave you the file.

19:53.386 --> 19:54.521
Great.

19:55.589 --> 19:57.824
Your career just ended.

20:05.271 --> 20:06.306
What's this?

20:06.339 --> 20:08.308
Another little
intimidation ploy?

20:10.110 --> 20:11.778
Shall I wave my leaflet?

20:13.146 --> 20:14.114
Sit, please.

20:20.787 --> 20:23.857
Steven O'Connell,
Sawyer Heinz,

20:23.890 --> 20:26.359
Kevin Schultz, three men

20:26.392 --> 20:28.529
whom you had sex
with on a first date.

20:28.562 --> 20:30.430
Todd Markham,
a former boyfriend,

20:30.463 --> 20:31.598
with whom you willingly

20:31.632 --> 20:33.767
and knowingly took
the drug GHB.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.902
Oh, come on.
It was one recreational--

20:35.936 --> 20:37.604
You're a person
with a history

20:37.638 --> 20:39.372
of taking
the drug willingly.

20:39.405 --> 20:43.076
I didn't take it willingly
here, and if your plan--

20:43.109 --> 20:45.812
On my unofficial count,
you've had 15 sexual partners.

20:45.846 --> 20:47.013
You've been busy.

20:51.417 --> 20:52.719
Michael Paris.

20:55.922 --> 20:57.123
You might not remember him.

20:57.157 --> 20:59.359
You knew him for less than
half an hour.

20:59.392 --> 21:01.167
You were standing in line
at the amusement park

21:01.201 --> 21:02.536
waiting for the Ferris wheel.

21:02.569 --> 21:03.937
You had sex with him

21:03.970 --> 21:05.438
on that Ferris wheel.

21:06.306 --> 21:08.542
I had just taken
the bar exam.

21:08.575 --> 21:10.276
A bunch of us went
to an amusement park,

21:10.310 --> 21:12.045
tired and, uh,
a little drunk.

21:12.078 --> 21:13.146
You had sex with a man

21:13.179 --> 21:15.148
you just met
on a Ferris wheel.

21:17.017 --> 21:19.019
Jamie,

21:19.052 --> 21:20.153
rape shield laws

21:20.186 --> 21:22.556
do not apply
to witnesses.

21:22.589 --> 21:25.859
I have a duty
to tear you up.

21:25.892 --> 21:28.094
So I'll ask you again,

21:28.128 --> 21:31.732
do not get in that chair.

21:31.765 --> 21:34.701
(music playing)

21:42.042 --> 21:43.109
Why can't he sleep over?

21:43.143 --> 21:44.678
Because, Bobby,
you're taking him to dinner.

21:44.711 --> 21:46.880
That was the deal.
He's my son.

21:46.913 --> 21:48.882
The plan...
Don't, okay?

21:48.915 --> 21:50.450
We can't just change
the plan on him like that.

21:50.483 --> 21:53.453
Lindsay, you changed the plan
when you walked out.

21:53.486 --> 21:55.255
You changed the plan
on him.

21:55.288 --> 21:56.456
That is not fair.

21:56.489 --> 21:57.991
We'll talk about this later.

21:58.024 --> 21:59.660
Lindsay...
I need to get to court.

22:07.040 --> 22:08.474
Well, I won't force you.

22:08.509 --> 22:11.411
Do you still even
want to call me?

22:11.444 --> 22:13.446
How much credibility
will I have if...

22:14.080 --> 22:15.516
It's a problem,

22:15.549 --> 22:17.250
I admit.

22:17.283 --> 22:19.152
But, Jamie,
I've got nothing to lose

22:19.185 --> 22:20.253
except this case

22:20.286 --> 22:21.555
if I don't call you.

22:21.588 --> 22:23.489
But even if I do
testify,

22:23.524 --> 22:26.092
you'll probably
still lose,

22:26.126 --> 22:27.661
and I will be...

22:27.694 --> 22:30.096
destroyed in the process.

22:30.130 --> 22:31.965
Like I said,
I won't force you,

22:31.998 --> 22:33.233
but, Jamie,

22:33.266 --> 22:34.568
I still need you.

22:38.004 --> 22:38.872
Okay.

22:40.373 --> 22:41.407
Are you sure?

22:42.609 --> 22:43.744
Of course not.

22:47.347 --> 22:48.582
Let's go.

22:49.883 --> 22:51.918
REPORTER: Taken into custody
an hour ago,

22:51.952 --> 22:54.521
Mr. Deeks is scheduled
to be arraigned any second.

22:54.555 --> 22:56.723
You recall Ms. Burns
was first reported missing

22:56.757 --> 22:58.324
seven weeks ago

22:58.358 --> 23:01.067
before turning up
wrapped in a package.

23:01.101 --> 23:02.836
Ms. Dole. Ms. Dole,
can I talk to you?

23:02.869 --> 23:04.370
No comment.
Thank you.

23:05.639 --> 23:07.874
WALLACE:
All the evidence is a result

23:07.908 --> 23:09.610
of a breach of
attorney/client privilege.

23:09.643 --> 23:10.544
It's inadmissible.

23:10.577 --> 23:13.079
Lindsay Dole
is a private citizen.

23:13.113 --> 23:14.548
So what?
She was his attorney.

23:14.581 --> 23:17.918
GAMBLE: Yes, and if your client
would like to sue her, fine.

23:17.951 --> 23:19.986
But she wasn't acting
for the government.

23:20.020 --> 23:22.388
You cannot suppress
our evidence.

23:22.422 --> 23:25.125
Did all of this information
come from Ms. Dole?

23:25.158 --> 23:27.360
She revealed her
client's involvement

23:27.393 --> 23:28.595
with Cindy Burns' death.

23:28.629 --> 23:29.896
What about Bakey?

23:29.930 --> 23:31.565
She only said
we should check

23:31.598 --> 23:33.166
to make sure he's alive,

23:33.199 --> 23:35.802
and we haven't
formally charged

23:35.836 --> 23:38.171
Mr. Deeks on Bakey.

23:38.204 --> 23:39.773
WALLACE:
Your Honor, technically,

23:39.806 --> 23:42.075
Ms. Dole's conduct
might not be state action.

23:42.108 --> 23:45.045
But we have
an enormous public policy

23:45.078 --> 23:46.780
concerning the sanctity

23:46.813 --> 23:48.114
of attorney/client privilege.

23:48.148 --> 23:49.916
Your Honor,
he's a nut case.

23:49.950 --> 23:51.652
He's killed before.

23:51.685 --> 23:53.554
He was acting erratically.

23:53.587 --> 23:55.556
Ms. Dole became convinced

23:55.589 --> 23:56.557
he would kill again,

23:56.590 --> 23:57.758
and if he had...

23:57.791 --> 23:59.560
You can't break privilege

23:59.593 --> 24:01.668
because of
a generalized danger.

24:01.702 --> 24:03.069
If it's not specific...

24:03.103 --> 24:05.572
Even if you are right,
that goes to your remedy

24:05.606 --> 24:07.073
against Lindsay Dole,

24:07.107 --> 24:08.274
not the Commonwealth.

24:08.308 --> 24:09.309
All right.

24:10.744 --> 24:13.113
Ms. Gamble is correct,
Mr. Wallace.

24:13.146 --> 24:15.616
This isn't state action.

24:15.649 --> 24:17.183
But, Ms. Gamble,

24:17.217 --> 24:18.985
public policy
is in play here.

24:21.154 --> 24:23.724
I'm gonna take a few minutes
to think about this.

24:25.191 --> 24:27.460
We will reconvene at 3:00.

24:27.493 --> 24:28.494
Until then.

24:32.498 --> 24:35.435
(indistinct chatter)

24:37.403 --> 24:40.340
(music playing)

24:51.351 --> 24:52.986
STRINGER:
It had been a fun date.

24:53.019 --> 24:56.590
Uh, we were watching television
at his place after,

24:56.623 --> 24:58.291
and he brought me
a glass of wine.

24:58.324 --> 24:59.492
Did you drink it?

24:59.526 --> 25:00.466
Yes.

25:00.500 --> 25:01.502
And then what happened?

25:02.435 --> 25:04.370
We kissed a little.

25:04.404 --> 25:07.073
Then I began
to feel groggy.

25:07.674 --> 25:09.610
And I said, "I need
to lie down a little,"

25:09.643 --> 25:12.813
which I did on his couch.

25:12.846 --> 25:15.782
The next thing I remember,
he was...

25:15.816 --> 25:16.883
on top of me.

25:16.917 --> 25:18.051
On top of you?

25:19.185 --> 25:20.420
Having intercourse.

25:21.187 --> 25:23.389
ATKINS: Do you have any memory

25:23.423 --> 25:25.325
of consenting
to this intercourse?

25:25.358 --> 25:27.227
No,

25:27.260 --> 25:28.829
and I never would have.

25:30.163 --> 25:31.497
I hardly knew him,

25:31.532 --> 25:34.568
uh, and I wasn't
that interested.

25:34.601 --> 25:36.903
In fact, I remember
during the date

25:36.937 --> 25:39.072
wishing I were more
physically attracted to him

25:39.105 --> 25:40.206
because he was funny.

25:40.240 --> 25:43.109
So you never gave him
any indication

25:43.143 --> 25:44.711
that you wanted
to have sex?

25:44.745 --> 25:46.947
Absolutely not.

25:46.980 --> 25:48.582
Thank you.

25:59.125 --> 26:00.767
Did you report this
to the police?

26:00.801 --> 26:02.168
No,

26:02.202 --> 26:05.038
because I didn't think
I could prove it.

26:05.071 --> 26:06.439
And I was afraid
of the stigma.

26:06.472 --> 26:07.974
YOUNG: Didn't you tell me

26:08.008 --> 26:09.776
that you don't remember
exactly

26:09.810 --> 26:10.977
what you said yes to?

26:11.612 --> 26:13.547
I never said yes...

26:13.580 --> 26:14.815
to sex.

26:14.848 --> 26:15.816
Did you take Quaaludes

26:15.849 --> 26:17.483
the night you had sex
with my client?

26:17.518 --> 26:18.919
No,

26:18.952 --> 26:21.387
and I did not have sex.

26:21.421 --> 26:22.823
He raped me.

26:35.401 --> 26:36.469
Nothing further.

26:36.503 --> 26:39.439
(music playing)

26:56.557 --> 26:57.591
WILCOX: Okay.

26:59.225 --> 27:00.967
I understand no civil rights

27:01.001 --> 27:03.804
have been violated here
by the state,

27:03.837 --> 27:05.839
which would mandate
either a dismissal

27:05.872 --> 27:08.041
or a suppression
of the evidence.

27:08.074 --> 27:11.512
But the public policy
grounds are so,

27:11.545 --> 27:13.747
so paramount here.

27:14.815 --> 27:16.116
The idea of an attorney

27:16.149 --> 27:18.084
incriminating her own client.

27:19.285 --> 27:21.555
Ms. Dole,
I can understand your concern.

27:21.588 --> 27:24.558
The man does present a danger.

27:24.591 --> 27:26.627
But the danger is general.

27:26.660 --> 27:29.162
It has to be specific

27:29.195 --> 27:31.097
for you to be allowed
to break privilege.

27:32.465 --> 27:33.667
I am, therefore,

27:33.700 --> 27:35.869
suppressing all of the evidence
provided by you

27:35.902 --> 27:37.237
to the district
attorney's office

27:37.270 --> 27:40.541
as well as the fruits
of that evidence,

27:40.574 --> 27:43.076
which, in this case,
amount to everything.

27:43.109 --> 27:45.411
I hate to do this,
but, as I said,

27:45.445 --> 27:48.515
the principle of privilege
is paramount

27:48.549 --> 27:50.183
and must remain so.

27:52.886 --> 27:54.220
Mr. Deeks,

27:56.222 --> 27:57.323
you need serious help.

27:58.759 --> 28:00.534
You're sick.

28:00.567 --> 28:01.802
You're perverted.

28:03.236 --> 28:05.305
But, for now, you're free.

28:05.338 --> 28:06.339
The case is dismissed,

28:06.372 --> 28:07.508
and we are adjourned.

28:07.541 --> 28:09.510
(gavel bangs)

28:09.543 --> 28:12.478
(indistinct chatter)

28:17.317 --> 28:18.752
If you think I'm feeling
happy now, Lindsay,

28:18.785 --> 28:19.786
you're very wrong.

28:19.820 --> 28:22.222
You're the only friend
I have,

28:22.255 --> 28:23.890
and you have betrayed me.

28:23.924 --> 28:25.391
Stanley,

28:25.425 --> 28:27.761
get yourself checked
into a hospital.

28:27.794 --> 28:29.730
I was just beginning
to believe

28:29.763 --> 28:30.964
in goodness again.

28:30.997 --> 28:32.899
I had a job.

28:32.933 --> 28:35.501
I even had hope.
And you undid it all.

28:36.903 --> 28:39.105
You undid it all.

28:42.075 --> 28:44.277
I am not at all happy!

28:52.919 --> 28:54.721
Bobby, why are you here?

28:56.022 --> 28:57.558
I don't know,
to be honest.

28:57.591 --> 28:59.492
To be honest, you do.

29:00.601 --> 29:01.735
Maybe I need--

29:04.270 --> 29:05.305
I don't know,

29:05.338 --> 29:06.072
company.

29:08.108 --> 29:10.343
I guess I showed up here
to find it.

29:11.477 --> 29:12.779
Is that so outrageous?

29:14.548 --> 29:16.116
Seeing this
particular company

29:16.149 --> 29:18.885
is what caused your wife
to leave you, yes.

29:21.655 --> 29:23.824
Look...
Do you even want her back?

29:23.857 --> 29:25.759
Of course
I want my family back.

29:25.792 --> 29:26.893
Good answer.

29:28.461 --> 29:30.130
I asked specifically
about her.

29:30.163 --> 29:31.464
Do you want Lindsay back?

29:31.497 --> 29:33.433
She left me, Sarah.

29:35.268 --> 29:37.370
She's the one who will
probably file for a divorce.

29:38.739 --> 29:41.107
On what grounds,
evasiveness?

29:41.141 --> 29:43.443
You really don't like
to answer questions, do you?

29:49.950 --> 29:52.919
I think you need to get
yourself into a taxi

29:52.953 --> 29:54.187
and get yourself
to your therapist.

29:54.220 --> 29:55.789
Does he have an ER?

29:56.790 --> 29:58.324
I'm not here
to discuss my feelings.

29:58.358 --> 29:59.359
Then why are you here?

29:59.392 --> 30:00.734
To talk about yours.

30:05.405 --> 30:06.673
I miss you.

30:12.445 --> 30:13.580
There, I said it.

30:15.348 --> 30:17.217
Bad husband,
horrible human being,

30:17.250 --> 30:19.152
off with his
cheating head.

30:23.757 --> 30:25.091
I miss you.

30:25.125 --> 30:28.061
(music playing)

30:37.137 --> 30:38.204
He's in there.

30:38.238 --> 30:39.973
Who?
Stanley.

30:40.006 --> 30:41.341
Should I call the police?

30:42.576 --> 30:43.510
What does he want?

30:43.544 --> 30:44.878
He wants to talk to you.

30:44.911 --> 30:46.179
What's his demeanor?

30:46.212 --> 30:47.380
It seems okay.

30:55.055 --> 30:56.289
Stanley,

30:57.758 --> 30:59.325
you can't keep
coming here.

30:59.359 --> 31:00.867
If you continue
to come here,

31:00.901 --> 31:03.203
I'll have to file
a complaint for stalking.

31:04.037 --> 31:06.940
I have no intention
of continuing to come here.

31:06.973 --> 31:09.510
I only want to say
what I came to say,

31:09.543 --> 31:11.612
and then I will never
come here again.

31:13.379 --> 31:14.581
Okay.

31:14.615 --> 31:16.950
As you know,

31:16.983 --> 31:19.720
I've never denied
being ill.

31:19.753 --> 31:21.988
I've never denied
being evil.

31:23.489 --> 31:25.626
One of the reasons
I came to you, initially,

31:25.659 --> 31:27.828
I saw you

31:27.861 --> 31:29.730
as my guardian
out of evil.

31:29.763 --> 31:32.165
And you, in fact,
became that, Lindsay.

31:33.700 --> 31:36.069
I was beginning to turn
my life around.

31:37.137 --> 31:38.772
As I said,

31:38.805 --> 31:41.241
I had rediscovered
both hope...

31:41.274 --> 31:42.843
and goodness,

31:42.876 --> 31:44.210
and I credit much of it

31:44.244 --> 31:45.946
to your influence.

31:47.514 --> 31:48.615
But...

31:49.683 --> 31:50.917
by turning against me...

31:50.951 --> 31:53.854
Stanley...
You made your position clear.

31:53.887 --> 31:55.388
I'd like to make mine.

32:02.569 --> 32:04.004
You walked away from me
last night

32:04.037 --> 32:05.471
like I was some crazy,

32:05.506 --> 32:08.274
which I am on many levels.

32:12.779 --> 32:14.247
But my feelings for you,

32:19.485 --> 32:22.122
I came here today

32:22.155 --> 32:23.890
because I wanted
you to know

32:24.958 --> 32:26.793
my friendship for you

32:26.827 --> 32:28.529
was sane,

32:29.996 --> 32:31.497
and real,

32:33.433 --> 32:34.835
and legitimate,

32:36.269 --> 32:37.538
and good.

32:39.973 --> 32:41.374
You represented
the part of me

32:41.407 --> 32:44.044
that wasn't ill or evil.

32:48.615 --> 32:50.984
It was good.

32:51.017 --> 32:52.786
(music playing)

33:09.976 --> 33:11.612
Same pattern,

33:11.645 --> 33:14.147
first or second date,

33:14.180 --> 33:16.216
glass of wine.

33:16.249 --> 33:17.984
Woman becomes groggy.

33:18.018 --> 33:19.219
Next thing,

33:19.252 --> 33:20.721
she's semiconscious,

33:20.754 --> 33:23.356
and he is on top of her.

33:23.389 --> 33:25.391
It happened with Judy Wilson,

33:25.425 --> 33:28.762
just like it happened
before her

33:28.795 --> 33:30.463
with Jamie Stringer.

33:31.231 --> 33:32.866
You want physical evidence?

33:32.899 --> 33:34.034
Physical bruising

33:34.067 --> 33:36.169
around the victim's genitalia.

33:36.202 --> 33:38.839
Traces of GHB,

33:38.872 --> 33:40.273
the date-rape drug,

33:40.306 --> 33:42.676
found in Judy's blood.

33:42.709 --> 33:44.745
This drug...

33:44.778 --> 33:48.649
is a sexual predator's
prized weapon.

33:48.682 --> 33:50.483
It's the prosecutor's nightmare

33:50.517 --> 33:53.587
because proof is so difficult.

33:55.455 --> 33:56.322
But think,

33:57.824 --> 33:58.825
just think,

33:58.859 --> 34:02.235
of the nightmare it is
for the victims,

34:02.268 --> 34:04.938
a growing number of victims.

34:04.971 --> 34:06.306
In the past year,

34:06.339 --> 34:08.975
there has been a 50% increase

34:09.009 --> 34:10.976
in GHB-related rapes.

34:11.011 --> 34:14.047
All we can do to stop it
is raise awareness

34:14.080 --> 34:15.348
and hope to God

34:15.380 --> 34:17.449
that the victims
have the courage

34:17.483 --> 34:19.620
to come forward.

34:19.652 --> 34:22.656
Judy Wilson
had that courage.

34:22.688 --> 34:24.558
Jamie Stringer
eventually

34:24.591 --> 34:27.193
found that courage.

34:27.226 --> 34:28.762
You think it was easy
for those women

34:28.795 --> 34:30.864
to sit in that chair?

34:30.897 --> 34:32.331
But they did it

34:32.364 --> 34:34.467
because it had to be told,

34:34.500 --> 34:36.902
Randall Pyne...

34:36.937 --> 34:38.539
is a rapist.

34:45.545 --> 34:47.880
Judy Wilson
couldn't remember

34:47.914 --> 34:49.282
taking GHB.

34:50.216 --> 34:52.217
Some people do take it
recreationally.

34:52.252 --> 34:54.621
It can be an aphrodisiac.

34:54.655 --> 34:56.188
Maybe Judy Wilson didn't.

34:56.222 --> 34:57.758
Maybe somebody
slipped it to her.

34:57.791 --> 35:00.233
Maybe she consented to sex.
Maybe she didn't.

35:00.266 --> 35:03.103
Maybe Jamie Stringer
consented to sex.

35:03.136 --> 35:04.505
Maybe she didn't.

35:04.538 --> 35:07.407
We don't know

35:07.440 --> 35:10.577
because they
don't have clear memories.

35:10.611 --> 35:13.413
Now, I agree
with the district attorney,

35:13.446 --> 35:15.448
GHB is out there.
It's a problem.

35:15.481 --> 35:17.083
We got to deal with that.

35:17.117 --> 35:19.886
But this is a criminal case.

35:19.920 --> 35:22.088
They're seeking
to take away a man's freedom.

35:22.122 --> 35:24.525
To do that,
you must prove this case

35:24.558 --> 35:26.860
beyond all reasonable doubt.

35:26.893 --> 35:28.629
Now, if the victim isn't sure,

35:28.662 --> 35:29.630
how can you be?

35:29.663 --> 35:31.932
Her own words on the stand,

35:31.965 --> 35:34.367
"I can't be sure."

35:41.808 --> 35:42.976
How can you be?

36:06.873 --> 36:08.842
Was that your best work,
Eugene?

36:09.442 --> 36:10.744
My client didn't complain.

36:10.777 --> 36:12.646
Problem is
the district attorney did.

36:12.679 --> 36:13.714
Excuse me?

36:13.747 --> 36:15.982
She's an officer
of the court.

36:16.016 --> 36:17.751
If she has knowledge
of a defense attorney

36:17.784 --> 36:19.720
tanking a case...
I didn't tank it.

36:19.753 --> 36:22.388
You could have discredited
Jamie Stringer.

36:23.624 --> 36:25.125
You pulled back.

36:25.158 --> 36:26.192
That, to me...
I was afraid

36:26.226 --> 36:27.661
of alienating myself

36:27.694 --> 36:29.029
and my client
from the jury,

36:29.062 --> 36:30.831
so I made
a strategic decision

36:30.864 --> 36:32.533
not to attack
Ms. Stringer.

36:32.566 --> 36:34.234
See, I might believe that

36:34.267 --> 36:36.436
if I hadn't seen you
in action before.

36:36.469 --> 36:39.673
I have witnessed you
going after rape victims.

36:39.706 --> 36:41.742
Here, the rape shield
didn't even apply.

36:41.775 --> 36:43.910
I made
a strategic decision

36:43.944 --> 36:45.378
not to attack the witness.

36:49.282 --> 36:50.517
I certainly have discretion

36:50.551 --> 36:52.853
to make strategic decisions,

36:52.886 --> 36:54.020
don't I, Your Honor?

36:54.755 --> 36:56.723
Only you...

36:56.757 --> 36:59.059
know what was in your mind,
counsel.

37:00.399 --> 37:01.400
There you go.

37:03.336 --> 37:05.138
I'm disappointed, Eugene.

37:10.476 --> 37:11.511
That's all.

37:19.452 --> 37:20.453
(door closes)

37:21.755 --> 37:23.790
We didn't know
who else to call.

37:23.824 --> 37:25.626
What's the cause
of death?

37:25.659 --> 37:27.994
Gunshot to the chest,
self-inflicted.

37:28.028 --> 37:29.362
God.
He did it in front

37:29.395 --> 37:30.731
of the police station.

37:36.670 --> 37:38.204
You sure
you're okay to do this?

37:39.372 --> 37:40.440
Yes.

37:48.281 --> 37:49.583
It's him.

37:49.616 --> 37:50.917
McGUIRE: You're sure?
It's him.

37:54.354 --> 37:55.455
McGUIRE: Okay.

37:58.024 --> 37:58.825
We can go.

37:58.859 --> 38:00.300
What happens to him?

38:00.967 --> 38:01.635
Sorry?

38:02.569 --> 38:03.403
He has no family.

38:03.436 --> 38:04.304
What will they do
with him?

38:05.972 --> 38:07.674
Public welfare will just
bury him somewhere.

38:09.576 --> 38:10.644
I want him
to get a funeral.

38:10.677 --> 38:12.278
Lindsay,
the guy is indigent.

38:12.312 --> 38:14.280
He doesn't have...
He had me.

38:14.314 --> 38:16.282
Excuse me?
He had me.

38:16.316 --> 38:18.318
I want him
to get a funeral.

38:18.351 --> 38:21.121
(music playing)

38:28.962 --> 38:30.463
KITTLESON: Members of the jury,

38:30.496 --> 38:31.565
have you reached a verdict?

38:32.032 --> 38:33.033
We have, Your Honor.

38:33.066 --> 38:34.000
What say you?

38:34.034 --> 38:35.636
In the matter
of the Commonwealth

38:35.669 --> 38:37.403
versus Randall Pyne

38:37.437 --> 38:38.972
on the charge of rape,

38:39.506 --> 38:41.675
we find the defendant,
Randall Pyne...

38:42.643 --> 38:43.744
guilty.

38:43.777 --> 38:46.713
(indistinct chatter)

38:52.052 --> 38:53.253
We appeal.

38:53.286 --> 38:54.521
KITTLESON: So noted.

38:54.555 --> 38:56.590
Members of the jury,
this concludes your service.

38:56.623 --> 38:57.558
You are dismissed

38:57.591 --> 39:00.100
with the thanks
of the court.

39:00.133 --> 39:01.267
We're adjourned.

39:16.750 --> 39:17.784
I know you didn't
have to do this.

39:17.818 --> 39:19.452
Actually,

39:22.623 --> 39:23.757
I did.

39:25.291 --> 39:26.693
Well,

39:28.461 --> 39:30.196
thank you again.

39:30.230 --> 39:33.166
(music playing)

39:45.245 --> 39:46.379
(door opens)

39:52.553 --> 39:54.020
(sighs)

39:54.054 --> 39:54.921
Thank you.

39:56.356 --> 39:58.759
I held back because I thought
it would help my client,

39:59.826 --> 40:01.101
not you.

40:05.438 --> 40:06.507
I just wanna say...

40:06.540 --> 40:07.774
Please,

40:08.842 --> 40:10.276
don't thank me.

40:15.081 --> 40:16.617
Now, if you'll excuse me...

40:22.556 --> 40:24.424
(door opens and closes)

40:27.160 --> 40:30.096
(music playing)

40:44.678 --> 40:46.680
PRIEST: If we are to believe

40:46.713 --> 40:48.348
that there is a good

40:48.381 --> 40:50.751
and powerful God,

40:50.784 --> 40:53.654
it follows that
we must also believe

40:53.687 --> 40:56.122
that there is a life
after this one.

40:57.323 --> 40:59.059
But what of the departed

40:59.092 --> 41:01.434
in this world?

41:01.467 --> 41:04.037
Are they gone
from this world?

41:04.070 --> 41:06.039
Do they exist on Earth?

41:07.473 --> 41:09.242
I would say to you

41:09.275 --> 41:11.177
they do.

41:11.211 --> 41:12.613
Stanley Deeks

41:12.646 --> 41:15.281
will continue
to live among us

41:15.315 --> 41:18.451
through the memories
of his loved ones.

41:18.484 --> 41:20.554
He will be kept alive

41:20.587 --> 41:23.123
by those who knew him,

41:23.156 --> 41:25.291
those who cherished

41:25.325 --> 41:27.761
his gentle spirit,

41:27.794 --> 41:29.229
those who saw his life

41:29.262 --> 41:31.565
as we see all lives

41:31.598 --> 41:33.233
as sacred,

41:33.266 --> 41:34.835
as children of God.

41:36.570 --> 41:38.204
To look on Stanley Deeks'

41:38.238 --> 41:39.640
time on Earth,

41:39.673 --> 41:42.809
to consider his victims,

41:42.843 --> 41:44.410
we must know

41:44.444 --> 41:47.113
there to be an afterlife.

41:47.147 --> 41:48.481
Otherwise,

41:48.515 --> 41:51.752
life on Earth
is all there is,

41:51.785 --> 41:53.987
and it can't be that.

41:54.020 --> 41:56.422
It simply can't be that.

41:56.456 --> 41:59.425
(music playing)

42:08.909 --> 42:11.845
(music playing)

42:35.401 --> 42:36.369
WOMAN: You stinker!

42:36.402 --> 42:39.339
(music playing)
