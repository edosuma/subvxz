00:02.000 --> 00:05.360
<i>The diagnosis
I gave you last week still stands.</i>

00:05.360 --> 00:07.680
<i>Early Onset Parkinson's.</i>

00:07.680 --> 00:09.240
<i>I was a patient of his,
many years ago.</i>

00:09.240 --> 00:12.720
<i>Been working with Cara and the group
for, oh, quite some time.</i>

00:12.720 --> 00:15.520
<i>'I've been asked to profile
a murder investigation</i>

00:15.520 --> 00:19.320
<i>'where a woman was forced
to stab herself 21 times.'</i>

00:19.320 --> 00:22.840
<i>We talked before about this number
being important to you, didn't we?</i>

00:22.840 --> 00:26.320
<i>It's a bus, actually.
My dad drove a number 21 bus.</i>

00:26.320 --> 00:29.120
<i>You were at the cemetery at the
same time as us finding the body?</i>

00:29.120 --> 00:31.320
<i>'At the same time
as you finding the body.'</i>

00:31.320 --> 00:33.520
<i>Missing person.
Liverpool.</i>

00:33.520 --> 00:35.040
<i>Please, my replacement?</i>

00:35.040 --> 00:37.520
<i>If you could take a moment
to consider the candidates?</i>

00:38.840 --> 00:41.960
<i>Did you not recognise her
at the mortuary when you saw her?</i>

00:41.960 --> 00:43.160
<i>No, no. I didn't.</i>

00:43.160 --> 00:45.160
<i>We found documents
in Catherine's room,</i>

00:45.160 --> 00:47.360
<i>her account
of you sexually assaulting her.</i>

00:47.360 --> 00:48.920
<i>And I was completely cleared.</i>

00:48.920 --> 00:51.880
<i>Why is she back in our lives?
What else are you hiding?</i>

01:04.080 --> 01:05.240
<i>SHE CLEARS THROAT</i>

01:05.240 --> 01:07.120
<i>Doctor.
Nurse?</i>

01:10.440 --> 01:12.520
<i>Oh, Christ!</i>

01:12.520 --> 01:14.360
<i>You'd better come with me.</i>

01:17.840 --> 01:20.840
<i>I'm sorry, Dr O'Loughlin.</i>

01:20.840 --> 01:22.320
<i>I just...</i>

01:23.560 --> 01:26.080
<i>...wanted the pain
to help block it all out.</i>

01:26.080 --> 01:28.560
<i>Catherine, you're self-harming.</i>

01:28.560 --> 01:32.440
<i>If you want my help, you'll have
to come and see me professionally.</i>

01:33.640 --> 01:35.720
<i>Regular appointments, OK?</i>

01:37.080 --> 01:39.640
<i>It's the only way I can help you.</i>

01:39.640 --> 01:41.000
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:41.000 --> 01:43.160
<i>'When Catherine came to see me, it...</i>

01:43.160 --> 01:46.680
<i>'it was clear that
the self-harming was getting worse,'</i>

01:46.680 --> 01:50.080
<i>but these things take time.
It's a process.</i>

01:50.080 --> 01:54.680
<i>Progress was slow,
but she did stop self-harming.</i>

01:54.680 --> 01:58.640
<i>And she was my client
for, well, ten months, I think.</i>

01:58.640 --> 02:00.280
<i>Until she made the allegation</i>

02:00.280 --> 02:02.680
<i>that you sexually assaulted her
under hypnosis...</i>

02:02.680 --> 02:04.680
<i>No.
...and then you were suspended...</i>

02:04.680 --> 02:06.920
<i>That happens
with any serious allegation.</i>

02:06.920 --> 02:08.960
<i>An inquiry concluded
that there was no basis...</i>

02:08.960 --> 02:10.680
<i>So why'd she make the allegation?</i>

02:10.680 --> 02:12.680
<i>I don't know why she made
the allegation, I...</i>

02:14.040 --> 02:16.280
<i>Look, it-it's not...</i>

02:16.280 --> 02:20.560
<i>It's common for some clients
to become infatuated</i>

02:20.560 --> 02:23.080
<i>with their therapists, that happens.</i>

02:23.080 --> 02:24.640
<i>I mean, I didn't see the signs
at first,</i>

02:24.640 --> 02:27.200
<i>but she did start wearing make-up
to the sessions and perfume.</i>

02:27.200 --> 02:30.520
<i>'She would schedule our sessions
for the end of her shift</i>

02:30.520 --> 02:32.880
<i>'so she could come in
in her civvies.</i>

02:32.880 --> 02:35.160
<i>'There was one occasion
she tried to kiss me,</i>

02:35.160 --> 02:38.080
<i>'and I stopped her,'</i>

02:38.080 --> 02:39.480
<i>another occasion where she tried</i>

02:39.480 --> 02:41.240
<i>to undress in the room
and I stopped her too.</i>

02:41.240 --> 02:42.800
<i>Maybe she was angry
at the rejection.</i>

02:42.800 --> 02:45.160
<i>Do you have a habit
of befriending your clients?</i>

02:45.160 --> 02:46.880
<i>No, I don't.</i>

02:48.640 --> 02:50.080
<i>Ah, yeah.
Cara Velasco.</i>

02:50.080 --> 02:51.440
<i>Mm-hm.
The sex worker</i>

02:51.440 --> 02:53.000
<i>that I witnessed you meeting up with</i>

02:53.000 --> 02:54.720
<i>when I made inquiries
about Catherine.</i>

02:54.720 --> 02:58.800
<i>Yeah, Cara's an ex-client of mine,
she's, um...</i>

02:58.800 --> 03:01.000
<i>She was one of my clients
from years ago, actually.</i>

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
<i>Do you keep
in touch with your male clients</i>

03:03.000 --> 03:04.840
<i>or is it just the female ones?</i>

03:04.840 --> 03:07.360
<i>I think you're aware that Cara
is helping me in my research...</i>

03:07.360 --> 03:10.040
<i>And like Catherine,
Cara is both attractive and damaged.</i>

03:10.040 --> 03:12.280
<i>She served time for assault,
was sectioned</i>

03:12.280 --> 03:14.160
<i>after she tried to commit suicide.</i>

03:14.160 --> 03:15.960
<i>What has this got to do
with my client...</i>

03:15.960 --> 03:17.200
<i>Dr O'Loughlin.
Mm.</i>

03:17.200 --> 03:20.120
<i>Tell me about your Friday - 23rd.</i>

03:20.120 --> 03:23.200
<i>The-The date
that Catherine disappeared?</i>

03:23.200 --> 03:24.640
<i>Um...</i>

03:25.840 --> 03:27.480
<i>It was a usual morning.</i>

03:27.480 --> 03:30.400
<i>I had clients
until about three o'clock.</i>

03:30.400 --> 03:31.720
<i>At four o'clock,</i>

03:31.720 --> 03:34.440
<i>I went to the hospital
to meet Dr Owens.</i>

03:34.440 --> 03:38.120
<i>He confirmed
my Parkinson's diagnosis</i>

03:38.120 --> 03:42.040
<i>and... I left around five o'clock,
I think.</i>

03:42.040 --> 03:44.080
<i>'Then I just went walking.</i>

03:44.080 --> 03:46.040
<i>'I was just walking,
trying to take it all in.</i>

03:46.040 --> 03:49.120
<i>'Ended up in Soho,
went to a few pubs.'</i>

03:49.120 --> 03:50.320
<i>Oh, which ones?</i>

03:50.320 --> 03:52.200
<i>Er...</i>

03:54.920 --> 03:56.480
<i>Honestly, I don't remember.</i>

03:56.480 --> 04:01.440
<i>I was trying to... deal with...
It was a difficult time for me.</i>

04:01.440 --> 04:02.840
<i>I had some bad news,</i>

04:02.840 --> 04:05.480
<i>and I got stupidly drunk,</i>

04:05.480 --> 04:09.280
<i>stayed for a few hours in town,
and... and I left</i>

04:09.280 --> 04:11.160
<i>and got home before midnight.</i>

04:11.160 --> 04:13.000
<i>My wife can corroborate this.</i>

04:13.000 --> 04:17.080
<i>And you've had no communication
with Catherine McCain</i>

04:17.080 --> 04:19.760
<i>since she made those allegations
five years ago?</i>

04:21.680 --> 04:23.520
<i>Look, there...
HE CLEARS THROAT</i>

04:23.520 --> 04:25.720
<i>There is something
that I haven't told you.</i>

04:25.720 --> 04:27.400
<i>Um...</i>

04:27.400 --> 04:30.160
<i>Several weeks before
any of this happened,</i>

04:30.160 --> 04:33.040
<i>she applied...</i>

04:33.040 --> 04:35.120
<i>for a job to be my receptionist.</i>

04:39.480 --> 04:42.000
<i>Dr O'Loughlin,
I'm putting you under caution.</i>

04:42.000 --> 04:43.280
<i>You do not have to say anything,</i>

04:43.280 --> 04:45.240
<i>but it may harm your defence
if you do not mention</i>

04:45.240 --> 04:47.720
<i>when questioned something
which you later rely on in court.</i>

04:47.720 --> 04:51.080
<i>Anything you do say may be given
in evidence. Is that clear to you?</i>

04:52.720 --> 04:54.360
<i>Yes, it is.</i>

04:54.360 --> 04:58.480
<i>So, you didn't think to tell us
the moment you found out?</i>

04:58.480 --> 05:00.200
<i>I think I'd like a word
with my client...</i>

05:00.200 --> 05:02.520
<i>No, no, it was the same feeling
I had at the mortuary.</i>

05:02.520 --> 05:05.000
<i>It-It... It didn't feel real.</i>

05:05.000 --> 05:07.440
<i>It-It felt out of place,</i>

05:07.440 --> 05:09.000
<i>and it...</i>

05:09.000 --> 05:11.480
<i>This is coming on top
of my Parkinson's diagnosis.</i>

05:11.480 --> 05:14.640
<i>I-I just wasn't thinking clearly,
and if I had have been, I...</i>

05:14.640 --> 05:17.040
<i>So, you didn't tell us
that you were at the cemetery</i>

05:17.040 --> 05:18.200
<i>when we found her body,</i>

05:18.200 --> 05:21.600
<i>you didn't tell us that
you recognised her at the mortuary,</i>

05:21.600 --> 05:24.640
<i>and you didn't tell us
that she applied to work for you?</i>

05:25.960 --> 05:28.600
<i>Is there anything else
that you haven't told us</i>

05:28.600 --> 05:30.440
<i>that might be rather important?</i>

05:31.520 --> 05:32.640
<i>No.</i>

05:32.640 --> 05:35.440
<i>Why would a woman who'd previously
accused you of sexual assault</i>

05:35.440 --> 05:37.080
<i>apply for a job
as your receptionist?</i>

05:37.080 --> 05:39.080
<i>I don't know why
she'd apply for a job!</i>

05:39.080 --> 05:42.160
<i>Maybe she was still obsessed!
Obsessed enough to turn up dead</i>

05:42.160 --> 05:44.520
<i>in a cemetery
on the one day of the year</i>

05:44.520 --> 05:46.800
<i>that you happen to be there?
I mean, is that what this is?</i>

05:46.800 --> 05:48.280
<i>She arranged the whole thing</i>

05:48.280 --> 05:50.440
<i>before stabbing herself 21 times</i>

05:50.440 --> 05:52.000
<i>and then someone buried her?!</i>

05:52.000 --> 05:54.240
<i>Detective Inspector...
No, no, I had the same thought!</i>

05:54.240 --> 05:55.280
<i>Let's hear it out loud!</i>

05:55.280 --> 05:57.560
<i>Makes it sound even more crazy!</i>

06:10.640 --> 06:12.680
<i>PIPE RATTLING</i>

06:12.680 --> 06:14.680
<i>Nah, it's all pretty loose.</i>

06:14.680 --> 06:17.120
<i>I think someone's had a go
at getting in here before.</i>

06:18.360 --> 06:21.800
<i>That one's definitely a replacement,
but I can't tell...</i>

06:21.800 --> 06:24.920
<i>PHONE RINGING
Sorry, excuse me.</i>

06:24.920 --> 06:26.640
<i>RINGING CONTINUES</i>

06:28.680 --> 06:29.800
<i>Hi.</i>

06:29.800 --> 06:32.080
<i>Hi.
'How'd it go?'</i>

06:32.080 --> 06:34.160
<i>Yeah, yeah, everything's fine.</i>

06:34.160 --> 06:36.360
<i>I mean, none of us understand
any of it, but...</i>

06:36.360 --> 06:37.640
<i>'But they've let you go?'</i>

06:37.640 --> 06:39.360
<i>Of course they let me go.</i>

06:39.360 --> 06:40.640
<i>Thank God.</i>

06:40.640 --> 06:42.960
<i>'Er... look, love,
I'm gonna go into work,'</i>

06:42.960 --> 06:44.280
<i>I'm feeling OK now, so...</i>

06:44.280 --> 06:46.200
<i>I'll give you a buzz later,
all right?</i>

06:46.200 --> 06:47.520
<i>'I love you.'</i>

06:47.520 --> 06:50.200
<i>I love you.
'Bye-bye.'</i>

06:51.480 --> 06:54.560
<i>I assume psychologists aren't big
on events being coincidental?</i>

06:54.560 --> 06:57.040
<i>No, not really. Um...</i>

06:57.040 --> 06:58.400
<i>Look...</i>

06:58.400 --> 06:59.840
<i>I think there's a possibility</i>

06:59.840 --> 07:02.600
<i>that one of my patients
might be involved in this somehow.</i>

07:02.600 --> 07:06.120
<i>You can't withhold information
in a murder investigation.</i>

07:06.120 --> 07:09.320
<i>No, I-I don't have any evidence
and I might be just grabbing...</i>

07:09.320 --> 07:11.080
<i>for...
You've already set alarm bells off</i>

07:11.080 --> 07:13.440
<i>by not saying that you recognised
the victim in the morgue.</i>

07:13.440 --> 07:16.480
<i>Technically right now, I can't break
doctor patient confidentiality...</i>

07:16.480 --> 07:18.240
<i>If the police
wanna speak to you again,</i>

07:18.240 --> 07:19.520
<i>you might not have a choice.</i>

07:19.520 --> 07:22.280
<i>Simon... thank you.
I appreciate it.</i>

07:29.400 --> 07:30.960
<i>'And your dad?'</i>

07:30.960 --> 07:34.520
<i>I was eight, and, er...
he went to work,</i>

07:34.520 --> 07:36.720
<i>and he didn't come back.</i>

07:36.720 --> 07:39.280
<i>What happened to him?</i>

07:39.280 --> 07:42.080
<i>You know,
nothing was gonna knock him down,</i>

07:42.080 --> 07:43.600
<i>not even those horses.</i>

07:43.600 --> 07:46.320
<i>Horses?
Yeah, yeah.</i>

07:46.320 --> 07:49.480
<i>I used to, like, sit
on his shoulders at football games,</i>

07:49.480 --> 07:50.680
<i>you know, that was our thing.</i>

07:50.680 --> 07:52.680
<i>We'd go to, like,
the Chelsea matches together,</i>

07:52.680 --> 07:56.120
<i>and, you know, sometimes there'd be,
like, running fights between fans,</i>

07:56.120 --> 07:58.640
<i>and the police would charge
on horses...</i>

07:58.640 --> 08:01.440
<i>Like, and I know, then,
you know, I-I should've been scared,</i>

08:01.440 --> 08:03.000
<i>but I...</i>

08:03.000 --> 08:05.560
<i>I never was, you know,
not... not when I was with Dad.</i>

08:05.560 --> 08:07.320
<i>What happened to him?</i>

08:07.320 --> 08:08.840
<i>Hmm.</i>

08:10.640 --> 08:12.480
<i>It wasn't his fault.</i>

08:13.480 --> 08:14.600
<i>Did he abandon you?</i>

08:14.600 --> 08:16.600
<i>Abandon?
Mm.</i>

08:16.600 --> 08:18.840
<i>Joe, you know nothing about him!</i>

08:18.840 --> 08:21.520
<i>Would you feel more comfortable
talking about your mother?</i>

08:21.520 --> 08:22.880
<i>I don't want to remember her.</i>

08:22.880 --> 08:24.000
<i>Because?</i>

08:24.000 --> 08:26.200
<i>Cos, I haven't seen her in years,
that's why.</i>

08:26.200 --> 08:28.000
<i>And she's dying of cancer.</i>

08:28.000 --> 08:29.520
<i>And I'm glad.</i>

08:29.520 --> 08:31.480
<i>You're glad?</i>

08:31.480 --> 08:33.000
<i>Yeah.</i>

08:34.000 --> 08:36.040
<i>She'd stay out
and sleep with all types.</i>

08:36.040 --> 08:39.440
<i>Me and my dad'd wait up for her
to get home in the mornings.</i>

08:39.440 --> 08:41.240
<i>How would your dad take it?</i>

08:42.680 --> 08:46.880
<i>I-I-I-I see him... I see him
disappearing little by little.</i>

08:48.280 --> 08:50.200
<i>Death by a thousand cuts.</i>

08:52.320 --> 08:54.440
<i>"Death by a thousand cuts"?</i>

08:56.480 --> 08:58.960
<i>What do you mean by
"death by a thousand cuts"?</i>

08:58.960 --> 09:01.320
<i>That's how she should die.</i>

09:02.480 --> 09:04.760
<i>Slow and in pain.</i>

09:04.760 --> 09:07.400
<i>And I'd like to watch.</i>

09:08.680 --> 09:11.080
<i>What would you say to her?</i>

09:11.080 --> 09:13.120
<i>If you were there, watching?</i>

09:14.560 --> 09:16.320
<i>Absolutely nothing.</i>

09:16.320 --> 09:18.840
<i>How many times do you think
she'd have to stab herself</i>

09:18.840 --> 09:20.200
<i>before she died?</i>

09:21.280 --> 09:24.080
<i>Maybe she'd only get
to stab herself 21 times, Bobby.</i>

09:24.080 --> 09:27.160
<i>You said 21 was the number
of the bus that your dad drove...</i>

09:27.160 --> 09:29.040
<i>He drove a bus
on lots of different routes,</i>

09:29.040 --> 09:30.280
<i>it's just a random number.</i>

09:30.280 --> 09:32.040
<i>Why do you keep on going on
about it?</i>

09:32.040 --> 09:33.080
<i>What's that?</i>

09:34.160 --> 09:35.840
<i>It's a whale.</i>

09:35.840 --> 09:37.160
<i>I do carvings and I like whales.</i>

09:37.160 --> 09:38.960
<i>It keeps me calm
in situations like this.</i>

09:38.960 --> 09:40.000
<i>I like the feel of it.</i>

09:44.600 --> 09:46.000
<i>You have it.</i>

10:02.160 --> 10:03.880
<i>Well, what else could I do,
Joe?</i>

10:03.880 --> 10:06.040
<i>I mean,
it is a murder investigation.</i>

10:06.040 --> 10:09.080
<i>Of course I had to say you'd been
accused of sexually assaulting her,</i>

10:09.080 --> 10:10.600
<i>I mean, they had all the documents,</i>

10:10.600 --> 10:14.240
<i>and it did nearly wreck your career
and your marriage, so...</i>

10:15.320 --> 10:18.680
<i>Come on, take a seat.
Let's... Finger exercise.</i>

10:29.400 --> 10:30.800
<i>JOE EXHALES</i>

10:33.360 --> 10:37.360
<i>You referred Bobby Moran to me,
when was it, six months ago?</i>

10:37.360 --> 10:41.120
<i>Really, this again?
Yes, er, yeah... I guess it was.</i>

10:41.120 --> 10:44.280
<i>Fully NHS funded, thought I was
doing you a favour. You're welcome.</i>

10:44.280 --> 10:48.480
<i>He seems overwhelmed
with violent desires to harm women.</i>

10:48.480 --> 10:52.040
<i>And his description of how
he wants to watch his mother die,</i>

10:52.040 --> 10:55.000
<i>it exactly mirrors
Catherine's murder.</i>

10:55.000 --> 10:57.440
<i>He said "death by a thousand cuts".</i>

10:57.440 --> 11:00.520
<i>Mm-hm. Well, Joe,
"death by a thousand cuts" is a...</i>

11:00.520 --> 11:02.240
<i>is a common enough saying.</i>

11:02.240 --> 11:05.320
<i>Yeah, but "slowly and in pain",
and he wants to be there?</i>

11:05.320 --> 11:09.800
<i>OK, but... does he have
any connection to Catherine McCain?</i>

11:11.160 --> 11:13.160
<i>Well, not that I know of.</i>

11:13.160 --> 11:14.240
<i>JACK SCOFFS</i>

11:14.240 --> 11:15.440
<i>What is that?</i>

11:15.440 --> 11:19.920
<i>It's a carving of a whale
that Bobby gave me.</i>

11:19.920 --> 11:23.280
<i>Joe, we talk about patients becoming
obsessed with their doctors...</i>

11:23.280 --> 11:25.240
<i>Can become a two-way street.</i>

11:26.480 --> 11:27.720
<i>Yeah.</i>

11:32.080 --> 11:34.680
<i>The canal runs
right along the murder scene,</i>

11:34.680 --> 11:36.160
<i>it's worth checking.</i>

11:36.160 --> 11:37.280
<i>See?</i>

11:37.280 --> 11:40.520
<i>Now, they know she's a nurse
and not a prostitute,</i>

11:40.520 --> 11:41.840
<i>I get to spend some money.</i>

11:41.840 --> 11:45.840
<i>A little late, but... still.
How's it going?</i>

11:45.840 --> 11:48.480
<i>The last two sightings
we have of Catherine McCain</i>

11:48.480 --> 11:50.240
<i>are still in the afternoon.</i>

11:50.240 --> 11:53.080
<i>Euston Station at 3:27
and then again at 4:17</i>

11:53.080 --> 11:55.520
<i>from a street camera
half a mile away.</i>

11:55.520 --> 11:57.800
<i>And O'Loughlin?
Nothing new.</i>

11:57.800 --> 12:01.040
<i>Cameras still have him going
in and out of Soho pubs,</i>

12:01.040 --> 12:03.000
<i>but he's on his own.</i>

12:03.000 --> 12:04.880
<i>Catherine doesn't show
on any footage,</i>

12:04.880 --> 12:08.280
<i>any footage of the Soho area
that afternoon or night.</i>

12:08.280 --> 12:13.680
<i>Her flatmate thought
that she was seeing a man in London.</i>

12:13.680 --> 12:16.480
<i>Well, her circles of association
have all been followed up.</i>

12:16.480 --> 12:18.320
<i>Sir?
Nobody knows anything about him.</i>

12:18.320 --> 12:19.680
<i>We've found something.</i>

12:23.080 --> 12:24.840
<i>We got something?</i>

12:24.840 --> 12:26.600
<i>What's that look like to you?</i>

12:26.600 --> 12:31.960
<i>CAMERA BEEPING, CLICKING</i>

12:43.080 --> 12:46.480
<i>Whoa-whoa! What are you doing here?</i>

12:46.480 --> 12:49.520
<i>Cool. Is that a portrait of Stormzy?</i>

12:49.520 --> 12:50.920
<i>It's a whale.</i>

12:50.920 --> 12:52.640
<i>He's just modelling for me.</i>

13:04.320 --> 13:05.400
<i>Joe?</i>

13:05.400 --> 13:07.600
<i>Isn't it great?
Yeah.</i>

13:07.600 --> 13:09.960
<i>Yeah, no, I'm...
I'm just taking it in.</i>

13:09.960 --> 13:11.760
<i>That's a great whale.</i>

13:11.760 --> 13:13.800
<i>Yeah, everyone in the class
is making something</i>

13:13.800 --> 13:17.720
<i>for a seascape collage.
It's for the school auction.</i>

13:17.720 --> 13:19.520
<i>It's in the diary.</i>

13:19.520 --> 13:21.040
<i>Tomorrow evening?</i>

13:21.040 --> 13:23.240
<i>You said you'd make it.
Yeah, I will.</i>

13:24.760 --> 13:26.960
<i>Well done, love.</i>

13:42.920 --> 13:44.440
<i>Did you have another session</i>

13:44.440 --> 13:46.880
<i>with that patient
you thought might be involved?</i>

13:46.880 --> 13:48.400
<i>Yeah.</i>

13:50.120 --> 13:52.520
<i>He loves his father,
hates his mother.</i>

13:54.120 --> 13:57.360
<i>It's just, it keeps going around
and around in my head.</i>

13:57.360 --> 14:00.760
<i>Catherine applying
to be my receptionist, and...</i>

14:00.760 --> 14:03.200
<i>the police finding her body
at the cemetery</i>

14:03.200 --> 14:05.600
<i>on the one day of the year
that we're there.</i>

14:07.120 --> 14:09.360
<i>It's up to the police
to find an explanation.</i>

14:09.360 --> 14:12.320
<i>OK? Your job is to not get stressed.</i>

14:12.320 --> 14:16.040
<i>Yeah. Stress is the worst thing
for Parkinson's.</i>

14:19.400 --> 14:23.600
<i>You spend your whole day talking
through other peoples' problems.</i>

14:23.600 --> 14:26.640
<i>We need to find time for ours.</i>

14:26.640 --> 14:31.080
<i>Parkinson's isn't something
"superhero Joe" does on his own, OK?</i>

14:35.240 --> 14:37.520
<i>And there's something
I want to talk to you about.</i>

14:38.840 --> 14:41.560
<i>What?
I feel bad that I...</i>

14:41.560 --> 14:44.440
<i>wasn't with you when you went
to get your diagnosis confirmed.</i>

14:44.440 --> 14:46.360
<i>No, I do,
cos I should've been there.</i>

14:46.360 --> 14:47.760
<i>And when you didn't come home,</i>

14:47.760 --> 14:50.240
<i>and I couldn't get hold of you,
I felt helpless.</i>

14:50.240 --> 14:51.680
<i>Sorry.</i>

14:53.880 --> 14:56.520
<i>And all that time...</i>

14:56.520 --> 15:00.360
<i>you were on your own,
just drinking yourself stupid.</i>

15:00.360 --> 15:03.600
<i>PHONE RINGING</i>

15:03.600 --> 15:05.080
<i>Let me go and check it.</i>

15:10.040 --> 15:12.920
<i>RINGING CONTINUES</i>

15:14.160 --> 15:15.560
<i>Hello?
'Dr O'Loughlin?'</i>

15:15.560 --> 15:18.840
<i>Yeah. 'It's Dr Webster here
from East Middlesex A&E.</i>

15:18.840 --> 15:23.040
<i>'Um... I have a patient of yours,
a Mr Moran. Bobby Moran.</i>

15:26.360 --> 15:27.600
<i>'Hello? Dr O'Loughlin?'</i>

15:27.600 --> 15:30.160
<i>Yeah, yeah, I'm-I'm still here.
What happened?</i>

15:30.160 --> 15:32.560
<i>'Oh, well, the police found him
lying on Waterloo Bridge.</i>

15:32.560 --> 15:34.480
<i>'He's pretty battered up. Um...</i>

15:34.480 --> 15:36.600
<i>'he's in a very confused,

15:36.600 --> 15:38.720
<i>'and he's asking for you.'</i>

15:38.720 --> 15:40.800
<i>I'll be right there.
'Thank you.'</i>

15:42.320 --> 15:44.160
<i>You don't have to go.</i>

15:44.160 --> 15:45.920
<i>I do.</i>

16:01.160 --> 16:03.840
<i>Cuts and bruises. No concussion.</i>

16:03.840 --> 16:05.480
<i>He was upsetting the other patients.</i>

16:05.480 --> 16:07.840
<i>He kept talking about washing
"the blood from his hands",</i>

16:07.840 --> 16:10.680
<i>so we kept him in the waiting room.
He's over there.</i>

16:10.680 --> 16:12.400
<i>Thanks, Doctor.
No probs.</i>

16:12.400 --> 16:14.720
<i>Mr Wilson,
do you wanna come with me?</i>

16:14.720 --> 16:16.680
<i>Hi, Bobby.</i>

16:18.480 --> 16:20.680
<i>What were you doing on the bridge?</i>

16:23.960 --> 16:26.320
<i>Can you tell me what you remember?</i>

16:27.520 --> 16:29.320
<i>Um...</i>

16:30.440 --> 16:32.560
<i>I was... I was, actually...
I was, um...</i>

16:32.560 --> 16:34.880
<i>I was going to bed with Jenni
if I'm honest.</i>

16:34.880 --> 16:38.240
<i>Jenni, your fiancee?
Yeah.</i>

16:38.240 --> 16:40.360
<i>Yeah, I must be driving her crazy.
I'm...</i>

16:40.360 --> 16:42.920
<i>I'm-I'm scared
that she won't marry me, Joe.</i>

16:43.880 --> 16:45.200
<i>Is she all right?</i>

16:45.200 --> 16:46.600
<i>Yeah.</i>

16:47.720 --> 16:49.120
<i>Bobby?</i>

16:50.400 --> 16:51.960
<i>Have you hurt Jenni?
No, look...</i>

16:51.960 --> 16:55.000
<i>I would never do anything like that,
Joe, and you know that, OK?</i>

16:56.320 --> 16:57.760
<i>Yeah.</i>

16:59.080 --> 17:00.360
<i>Do you hear the windmills?</i>

17:00.360 --> 17:02.800
<i>Windmills?
Yeah, yeah, they, like...</i>

17:02.800 --> 17:05.000
<i>They keep everything going.
Like, you know,</i>

17:05.000 --> 17:07.400
<i>without them everything would stop,
and, um...</i>

17:07.400 --> 17:10.080
<i>and if you, like, put your ear
to the ground, you know, you can...</i>

17:10.080 --> 17:11.920
<i>you can, um...
you can hear them, that's...</i>

17:11.920 --> 17:13.600
<i>That's what I was doing
on the bridge,</i>

17:13.600 --> 17:15.720
<i>I was listening to them.
Well, what do you hear?</i>

17:15.720 --> 17:17.840
<i>Screaming.</i>

17:17.840 --> 17:19.680
<i>Who's screaming?</i>

17:19.680 --> 17:22.560
<i>Well, the blades, you know,
they cut the air, and...</i>

17:22.560 --> 17:24.000
<i>the air screams in pain.</i>

17:27.200 --> 17:28.920
<i>You know, I hurt people in dreams, Joe.</i>

17:28.920 --> 17:30.960
<i>You know, I do bad things, but...</i>

17:32.120 --> 17:34.160
<i>...I know that you know I'm not bad, mate.</i>

17:35.240 --> 17:36.360
<i>How do you hurt them?</i>

17:36.360 --> 17:39.040
<i>You know, hate is normal.
Everyone hates.</i>

17:39.040 --> 17:41.040
<i>Who do you hate?</i>

17:42.200 --> 17:44.680
<i>There's this woman
that keeps on turning up when, um...</i>

17:44.680 --> 17:46.640
<i>I don't expect her.
It's weird, actually.</i>

17:46.640 --> 17:48.280
<i>A woman?
Yeah.</i>

17:49.680 --> 17:51.120
<i>Can you describe her for me?</i>

17:52.880 --> 17:54.400
<i>Does she have scars, Bobby?</i>

17:54.400 --> 17:56.120
<i>Self-harming scars like you?</i>

17:56.120 --> 17:59.400
<i>"Now, Bobby, don't tell lies!"</i>

17:59.400 --> 18:00.960
<i>HE MUTTERS</i>

18:00.960 --> 18:03.240
<i>Please, don't make me say it,
not now. Thank you...</i>

18:03.240 --> 18:05.080
<i>What's she trying
to make you say, Bobby?</i>

18:06.760 --> 18:09.080
<i>You know what? I've actually
just had... had a warning.</i>

18:09.080 --> 18:11.600
<i>I've got to get back to work.
Bobby, Bobby, the doctor told me</i>

18:11.600 --> 18:13.880
<i>you were talking about washing blood
off your hands.</i>

18:13.880 --> 18:16.920
<i>No, I don't think I was, mate. Have
you hurt someone tonight, Bobby?</i>

18:16.920 --> 18:19.600
<i>No, of course I haven't hurt...
What? Why do you keep on... No!</i>

18:19.600 --> 18:22.160
<i>What about the woman who shows up
when you don't expect her?</i>

18:22.160 --> 18:23.680
<i>What's her name?</i>

18:23.680 --> 18:25.040
<i>If I don't go now, I'll lose my job.</i>

18:25.040 --> 18:27.080
<i>Is her name Catherine?
Jenni will throw me out. No!</i>

18:27.080 --> 18:28.880
<i>Please, come back and talk to me.
Thank you.</i>

18:31.800 --> 18:33.640
<i>Sorry, Doctor...</i>

18:33.640 --> 18:37.160
<i>Did you... Did you smell
something off him right now?</i>

18:37.160 --> 18:39.560
<i>Er... no.
Like a sweet smell? A cloying...</i>

18:39.560 --> 18:41.400
<i>I'm really sorry,
I've gotta get on with this.</i>

18:41.400 --> 18:43.680
<i>Chloroform. Did you smell chloroform
from him then? No.</i>

18:43.680 --> 18:45.680
<i>I'm really sorry,
but I don't have time for this.</i>

18:45.680 --> 18:47.440
<i>Do you wanna come with me?</i>

<i>I'm Dr Joe O'Loughlin.</i>

<i>Thank you very much, Dr O'Loughlin.
You're very welcome.</i>

20:24.280 --> 20:26.760
<i>I just wanted to
hand it to you personally,</i>

<i>so I could ask you a few questions
about Bobby.</i>

20:29.480 --> 20:34.360
<i>This might help... mitigating
Bobby Moran's sentencing,</i>

20:34.360 --> 20:36.640
<i>but I'm still

20:36.640 --> 20:38.760
<i>Ha! "Understanding" them.</i>

20:40.080 --> 20:42.400
<i>That would tip me over the edge.</i>

20:42.400 --> 20:44.240
<i>All I know is the charge sheet</i>

20:44.240 --> 20:47.840
<i>and the brief conversation
I had with him to arrange bail.</i>

<i>You're his doctor.</i>

<i>Yeah, I'm just concerned
that he's hiding his past from me.</i>

21:03.480 --> 21:05.800
<i>As far as I know
it's a first-time offence.</i>

21:05.800 --> 21:07.840
<i>With your experience,</i>

21:07.840 --> 21:11.160
<i>is he likely to have been violent
in the past, especially to women?</i>

21:11.160 --> 21:14.240
<i>He's a client,
I'm not gonna speculate on that.</i>

21:14.240 --> 21:16.600
<i>You're not in the legal aid

that went bust years ago?</i>

<i>Oh, I'm sorry,

23:31.160 --> 23:32.720
<i>Oh, come on, mate, a sealed bid,</i>

23:32.720 --> 23:34.800
<i>it's a school auction,
it's not Sotheby's!</i>

23:34.800 --> 23:36.640

<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

23:47.120 --> 23:50.360
<i>What the hell was that about, Joe?
I wanted the drawing.</i>

23:50.360 --> 23:51.920
<i>I didn't want anyone else
to have it.</i>

23:51.920 --> 23:53.560
<i>So embarrassing.</i>

24:38.560 --> 24:40.680
<i>Sorry, you go.</i>

24:40.680 --> 24:42.440
<i>So, we've just interviewed two men</i>

24:42.440 --> 24:44.880
<i>who say they were with Catherine
the night she disappeared.</i>

24:44.880 --> 24:46.880
<i>They talked to her in a pub
about half a mile away</i>

24:46.880 --> 24:49.920
<i>from where her body was discovered.
They said she left the pub</i>

24:49.920 --> 24:52.000
<i>some time between 10:30 and 10:45.
PHONE BUZZES</i>

24:52.000 --> 24:53.960
<i>They said she was gonna meet someone.</i>

24:55.280 --> 24:56.640
<i>Good job.</i>

25:01.160 --> 25:04.920
<i>Forensics took another look
at her corpse, right?</i>

25:04.920 --> 25:08.040
<i>It tests positive for chloroform.</i>

25:09.400 --> 25:12.760
<i>Oh, my God.
How the hell did he know that?</i>

25:33.280 --> 25:34.960
<i>Sorry to interrupt you.</i>

25:34.960 --> 25:37.120
<i>We just need to ask you
a couple of questions.</i>

25:38.160 --> 25:39.720
<i>Thanks.</i>

25:46.480 --> 25:47.760
<i>Right, how can I help?</i>

25:47.760 --> 25:50.600
<i>OK, so when someone's been stabbed
that many times,</i>

25:50.600 --> 25:52.920
<i>you don't bother looking
for much else.</i>

25:55.040 --> 25:56.960
<i>How did you know
about the chloroform?</i>

25:56.960 --> 25:59.200
<i>So you did find traces on Catherine?</i>

25:59.200 --> 26:02.600
<i>How did you know we would?</i>

26:03.600 --> 26:06.080
<i>I can't break doctor-patient
confidentiality, I'm sorry.</i>

26:06.080 --> 26:07.160
<i>Actually, Dr O'Loughlin,</i>

26:07.160 --> 26:09.360
<i>you have to divulge
confidential information</i>

26:09.360 --> 26:12.160
<i>if a client communicates plausible
intention to do serious harm.</i>

26:12.160 --> 26:14.560
<i>No, that's a duty
to protect an intended victim,</i>

26:14.560 --> 26:16.360
<i>I've no idea what my client intends.</i>

26:16.360 --> 26:18.560
<i>What I know is,
that night I called you,</i>

26:18.560 --> 26:20.120
<i>I smelt chloroform on him.</i>

26:20.120 --> 26:24.480
<i>And is that why you asked about
any other women having gone missing?</i>

26:24.480 --> 26:26.920
<i>I'd been suspicious</i>

26:26.920 --> 26:29.760
<i>of his involvement
in Catherine's death...</i>

26:30.760 --> 26:32.760
<i>...ever since you told me
she was stabbed 21 times.</i>

26:32.760 --> 26:34.920
<i>And, yes, I was concerned
that maybe he'd come</i>

26:34.920 --> 26:36.440
<i>from attacking somebody else.</i>

26:36.440 --> 26:38.960
<i>Well, he may have done,
what's his name?</i>

26:38.960 --> 26:40.080
<i>I could be wrong. No.</i>

26:40.080 --> 26:41.960
<i>No, no.
Tell me what you know right now</i>

26:41.960 --> 26:44.840
<i>or I will arrest you for
perverting the course of justice.</i>

26:47.800 --> 26:49.000
<i>All right.</i>

26:55.560 --> 26:58.200
<i>He has an appointment later today.</i>

27:06.240 --> 27:07.600
<i>If you're right,</i>

<i>Tell me this means
we're done with Bobby Moran now?</i>

28:27.400 --> 28:29.840
<i>Yeah, I think it does. Excellent.</i>

28:29.840 --> 28:31.960
<i>Cos it's really not a good look

<i>Now, it's not scary.</i>

<i>We can confirm that
a 42-year-old man has been arrested</i>

33:26.920 --> 33:28.720
<i>in connection to the murder
of Catherine...</i>

33:28.720 --> 33:30.760
<i>CLATTERING</i>

33:32.400 --> 33:35.200
<i>HAMMERING</i>

33:37.480 --> 33:39.360
<i>Oh, my God!
You all right, Mrs O'Loughlin?</i>

33:39.360 --> 33:40.800
<i>Hey!</i>

33:40.800 --> 33:43.440
<i>Oi!</i>

33:43.440 --> 33:45.360
<i>Out!</i>

33:45.360 --> 33:47.080
<i>Go on, get out!</i>

33:48.360 --> 33:50.480
<i>Clear off! Go on, piss off!</i>

33:52.480 --> 33:53.960
<i>Fucking paps.</i>

33:56.840 --> 33:58.880
<i>How can they do that?</i>

33:58.880 --> 34:00.840
<i>I couldn't catch them.</i>

34:00.840 --> 34:02.360
<i>Thank you.</i>

34:02.360 --> 34:04.480
<i>BOTH PANTING</i>

34:05.680 --> 34:07.600
<i>Scumbags.
Yeah.</i>

34:09.320 --> 34:11.520
<i>I hate to tell you this
when you've got so much going on,</i>

34:11.520 --> 34:14.080
<i>but, erm... there's a real nightmare
under your floorboards,</i>

34:14.080 --> 34:15.520
<i>that's why I've been here all day.</i>

34:15.520 --> 34:17.440
<i>If I don't deal with it right away,</i>

34:17.440 --> 34:19.120
<i>you're gonna have a flood
on your hands.</i>

34:20.280 --> 34:21.480
<i>Sorry.</i>

34:26.400 --> 34:28.400
<i>You gonna be all right?</i>

34:29.520 --> 34:30.640
<i>Yeah.</i>

34:32.440 --> 34:34.000
<i>Well, I'll, er...</i>

34:35.400 --> 34:36.760
<i>...I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

34:36.760 --> 34:38.800
<i>Yeah. Thanks, DJ.</i>

34:49.000 --> 34:51.200
<i>DOOR OPENING</i>

35:01.760 --> 35:03.680
<i>Case number 496.</i>

35:03.680 --> 35:05.960
<i>This is the interview
with Dr Joseph O'Loughlin</i>

35:05.960 --> 35:07.760
<i>in the presence of Mr Simon Cleaver.</i>

35:07.760 --> 35:11.120
<i>I am DS Devi,
also present is DI Ruis.</i>

35:11.120 --> 35:13.320
<i>Interview time, 21:50.</i>

35:13.320 --> 35:15.920
<i>You served up Bobby Moran
to divert our attention.</i>

35:15.920 --> 35:17.080
<i>No, I didn't.</i>

35:17.080 --> 35:19.960
<i>Your notes on him that you
"so reluctantly" shared with us,</i>

35:19.960 --> 35:22.240
<i>none of them make any sense.</i>

35:22.240 --> 35:25.680
<i>He doesn't have a job,
or a fiancee.</i>

35:25.680 --> 35:27.120
<i>He lives in a hostel,</i>

35:27.120 --> 35:29.960
<i>a hostel where everyone
who knows him seems to like him.</i>

35:29.960 --> 35:32.000
<i>"A gentle spirit" is what one said.</i>

35:32.000 --> 35:33.280
<i>He didn't grow up in London,</i>

35:33.280 --> 35:36.200
<i>never been to a football match
with his dad,</i>

35:36.200 --> 35:39.080
<i>the woman he assaulted,
didn't have a child with her.</i>

35:39.080 --> 35:40.640
<i>So, he told me a pack of lies.</i>

35:40.640 --> 35:44.160
<i>And he told us that you pushed him</i>

35:44.160 --> 35:47.200
<i>into telling you about a woman
who self-harmed</i>

35:47.200 --> 35:49.600
<i>and that you named her "Catherine".</i>

35:49.600 --> 35:50.800
<i>JOE SCOFFS</i>

35:50.800 --> 35:53.800
<i>The A&E doctor who treated him
has told us</i>

35:53.800 --> 35:56.080
<i>that you were the only one
who smelt chloroform on him,</i>

35:56.080 --> 35:58.040
<i>and you tried to make
a really big thing about it.</i>

35:58.040 --> 35:59.400
<i>You knew we'd find traces</i>

35:59.400 --> 36:02.760
<i>cos you were the one who used
chloroform on Catherine McCain.</i>

36:02.760 --> 36:04.080
<i>No, I didn't.</i>

36:04.080 --> 36:07.000
<i>All that play acting
about patient confidentiality!</i>

36:07.000 --> 36:11.040
<i>You framed Moran because of
his recent violent episode,</i>

36:11.040 --> 36:12.720
<i>you knew he roamed around at night,</i>

36:12.720 --> 36:15.040
<i>how hard he finds it
to explain himself.</i>

36:15.040 --> 36:17.920
<i>I mean, he looks the part.
You were hoping for a bit of luck.</i>

36:17.920 --> 36:19.160
<i>He's playing you.</i>

36:19.160 --> 36:22.800
<i>Listen, we know Bobby Moran
didn't kill Catherine McCain!</i>

36:22.800 --> 36:23.960
<i>He couldn't have!</i>

36:23.960 --> 36:27.200
<i>We've got, like, what,
about a dozen witnesses</i>

36:27.200 --> 36:28.520
<i>at an evening class</i>

36:28.520 --> 36:31.480
<i>that can verify where he was
the night she disappeared.</i>

36:31.480 --> 36:34.640
<i>And then he's cast iron all through
that night - at the hostel,</i>

36:34.640 --> 36:39.640
<i>and into the next morning.
Again, verified by witnesses, CCTV.</i>

36:39.640 --> 36:41.600
<i>He didn't do it.</i>

36:41.600 --> 36:45.160
<i>Bobby Moran told you
about his obsession</i>

36:45.160 --> 36:48.600
<i>with the number 21
about a month before the murder.</i>

36:48.600 --> 36:51.160
<i>Again, he said you kept pushing him
about it.</i>

36:51.160 --> 36:54.600
<i>Then, after you killed
Catherine McCain,</i>

36:54.600 --> 36:59.120
<i>to pin it on him,
you stabbed her 21 times.</i>

36:59.120 --> 37:01.840
<i>Again, it's a simple question.</i>

37:01.840 --> 37:06.160
<i>That night, where were you
after ten o'clock?</i>

37:06.160 --> 37:07.200
<i>I told you before,</i>

37:07.200 --> 37:09.280
<i>I got drunk and then I went walking,</i>

37:09.280 --> 37:11.400
<i>'and I walked and I walked and I -
to try and get sober.'</i>

37:11.400 --> 37:12.480
<i>Sorry.</i>

37:12.480 --> 37:14.600
<i>I didn't wanna go home drunk!</i>

37:14.600 --> 37:16.920
<i>What was your route?
I...</i>

37:16.920 --> 37:20.000
<i>I was all over the place.
I don't know what my route was.</i>

37:20.000 --> 37:22.400
<i>I mean, is memory loss
a symptom of Parkinson's?</i>

37:22.400 --> 37:24.200
<i>Detective Inspector, please.</i>

37:24.200 --> 37:26.040
<i>Well, perhaps we can jog
that memory for you.</i>

37:26.040 --> 37:28.560
<i>We pulled Catherine's phone records.</i>

37:28.560 --> 37:32.120
<i>The last call she ever made...</i>

37:33.120 --> 37:36.840
<i>...was to your office at 6:37.</i>

37:36.840 --> 37:40.480
<i>My client has admitted
knowing the victim,</i>

37:40.480 --> 37:43.760
<i>and he has also explained
that she applied for a job</i>

37:43.760 --> 37:45.000
<i>at his practice.</i>

37:45.000 --> 37:46.760
<i>We dredged the canal by the pub</i>

37:46.760 --> 37:50.120
<i>where Catherine disappeared.
Horrible, messy job.</i>

37:50.120 --> 37:53.440
<i>Bicycles, washing machines...
I mean, all sorts.</i>

37:53.440 --> 37:56.240
<i>And Catherine's handbag.</i>

37:57.560 --> 37:59.240
<i>For the purposes of the tape,</i>

37:59.240 --> 38:02.200
<i>I'm showing Dr O'Loughlin a
woman's handbag and a mobile phone.</i>

38:02.200 --> 38:04.200
<i>Inside the bag, we found her phone.</i>

38:04.200 --> 38:05.240
<i>And I've gotta say,</i>

38:05.240 --> 38:07.360
<i>it's amazing what they can do
with tech these days.</i>

38:07.360 --> 38:09.440
<i>They pieced together
a part of her calendar.</i>

38:10.440 --> 38:12.520
<i>Catherine had an appointment</i>

38:12.520 --> 38:15.160
<i>on the night she disappeared</i>

38:15.160 --> 38:17.560
<i>with a J... O.</i>

38:18.760 --> 38:21.200
<i>J... O?</i>

38:21.200 --> 38:23.600
<i>Oh! Your initials.</i>

38:23.600 --> 38:25.200
<i>Right?</i>

38:25.200 --> 38:27.200
<i>You arranged to meet.
No, we didn't.</i>

38:27.200 --> 38:28.960
<i>I think she was coming after you because...</i>

38:28.960 --> 38:30.600
<i>No!
...she'd been denied justice...</i>

38:30.600 --> 38:32.240
<i>No, she wasn't.
...for over four years.</i>

38:32.240 --> 38:34.240
<i>I didn't sexually assault her!
She was intent</i>

38:34.240 --> 38:36.560
<i>on ruining your career
and your marriage. No!</i>

38:36.560 --> 38:38.920
<i>She happened to confront you
on the day you'd just been told</i>

38:38.920 --> 38:40.960
<i>you had a life-altering disease.
That's not true.</i>

38:40.960 --> 38:42.160
<i>You were beyond angry,</i>

38:42.160 --> 38:44.800
<i>and you killed her...
You don't... You have nothing!</i>

38:44.800 --> 38:47.320
<i>...in a way that made it look like...
You have nothing!</i>

38:47.320 --> 38:49.520
<i>...demented actions
of one of your patients.</i>

38:49.520 --> 38:51.680
<i>You have some initials
on a calendar,</i>

38:51.680 --> 38:53.200
<i>and you-you have a call
to my office!</i>

38:53.200 --> 38:54.560
<i>You've nothing!</i>

39:00.760 --> 39:02.960
<i>Shame we had to let him go.
Mm.</i>

39:02.960 --> 39:04.920
<i>CPS think we don't have enough yet.</i>

39:04.920 --> 39:07.800
<i>It'll be a fight, but we need
to gain access to his client list</i>

39:07.800 --> 39:09.640
<i>over the last 15 years,</i>

39:09.640 --> 39:13.200
<i>find out if he abused any of 'em...</i>

39:13.200 --> 39:15.680
<i>or if any of them have gone missing.</i>

39:16.800 --> 39:18.760
<i>Sir.</i>

39:18.760 --> 39:22.600
<i>POLICE SIRENS ECHOING</i>

39:22.600 --> 39:24.600
<i>'..my favourite tunes there,</i>

39:24.600 --> 39:27.040
<i>'and you're listening
to breakfast with Bonnie.'</i>

39:35.440 --> 39:37.560
<i>What happened?</i>

39:37.560 --> 39:40.400
<i>How can they get away with that?</i>

39:40.400 --> 39:43.600
<i>Jumping to stupid conclusions,</i>

39:43.600 --> 39:46.520
<i>no credible evidence whatsoever.</i>

39:46.520 --> 39:47.960
<i>What?</i>

39:49.080 --> 39:51.840
<i>I've gone along with your story.</i>

39:51.840 --> 39:53.520
<i>But the day we were at the cemetery,</i>

39:53.520 --> 39:55.040
<i>I didn't see you pick up a spade</i>

39:55.040 --> 39:57.000
<i>and move it
from your mother's grave.</i>

40:03.720 --> 40:05.200
<i>OK...</i>

40:06.360 --> 40:07.840
<i>...but I did.</i>

40:07.840 --> 40:09.480
<i>And I lied to the police</i>

40:09.480 --> 40:12.240
<i>when I told them
that you came home around midnight.</i>

40:12.240 --> 40:14.480
<i>You woke me, taking a shower.</i>

40:14.480 --> 40:17.200
<i>I checked the clock,
it was 4:30.</i>

40:18.240 --> 40:22.680
<i>Maybe... you got up in the middle
of the night to have a shower.</i>

40:22.680 --> 40:26.600
<i>But you saying that you spent
all night on your own drinking,</i>

40:26.600 --> 40:28.760
<i>that's not who you are, Joe.</i>

40:30.560 --> 40:31.960
<i>I don't believe you.</i>

40:33.240 --> 40:36.160
<i>Why didn't you say
any of this before?</i>

40:36.160 --> 40:38.640
<i>I was scared
you were having an affair</i>

40:38.640 --> 40:40.320
<i>and I didn't want it to be true.</i>

40:41.320 --> 40:43.360
<i>But you met with her, didn't you?</i>

40:43.360 --> 40:45.440
<i>You met with Catherine.</i>

40:47.880 --> 40:49.880
<i>Joe, you're scaring me.</i>

40:51.440 --> 40:53.880
<i>Oh, God! You were with her!</i>

40:53.880 --> 40:56.400
<i>I didn't meet with Catherine,
I met with Cara.</i>

40:56.400 --> 40:59.360
<i>Wait... What, Cara? Why?</i>

40:59.360 --> 41:01.160
<i>I don't know...</i>

41:01.160 --> 41:03.800
<i>The shock from the diagnosis,
I wanted to talk to somebody.</i>

41:03.800 --> 41:05.480
<i>Something that important
happens to you</i>

41:05.480 --> 41:06.800
<i>and you don't come home to me?</i>

41:06.800 --> 41:09.000
<i>I couldn't face
telling you about it.</i>

41:09.000 --> 41:11.560
<i>So you went to a prostitute?
She's a friend of mine...</i>

41:11.560 --> 41:13.280
<i>You would've had a plan,
I didn't want...</i>

41:13.280 --> 41:14.880
<i>You would've tried
to make it better.</i>

41:14.880 --> 41:17.080
<i>I didn't want to make it better...
Oh, so it's my fault?</i>

41:17.080 --> 41:18.840
<i>I'm not saying it's your fault,
I just...</i>

41:18.840 --> 41:20.640
<i>I wanted to fucking
destroy everything!</i>

41:22.640 --> 41:24.520
<i>Did you have sex with her?</i>

41:26.480 --> 41:28.040
<i>HE EXHALES</i>

41:30.400 --> 41:31.440
<i>Then you came home,</i>

41:31.440 --> 41:33.880
<i>and you had a shower,
and you got into bed with me?</i>

41:38.320 --> 41:40.280
<i>Did you use a condom?</i>

41:43.960 --> 41:47.400
<i>You had sex with her,
and then you came home,</i>

41:47.400 --> 41:49.120
<i>and you fucked me!</i>

41:49.120 --> 41:51.760
<i>Oh, I'm sorry, did that hurt you?</i>

41:51.760 --> 41:53.240
<i>I'm just not used to this!</i>

41:56.480 --> 41:59.440
<i>You fucking coward!
All right, I'm sorry. All right.</i>

41:59.440 --> 42:03.280
<i>Get out!
You are not wanted in this house!</i>

42:04.440 --> 42:06.320
<i>Get out!</i>

42:11.760 --> 42:15.600
<i>SHE SOBS</i>

42:21.160 --> 42:23.680
<i>So, did you call them?
No.</i>

42:23.680 --> 42:25.760
<i>Joe, seriously,</i>

42:25.760 --> 42:29.000
<i>go to the police, go now,
just tell them where you were.</i>

42:29.000 --> 42:30.400
<i>Tell them what?</i>

42:30.400 --> 42:31.960
<i>Tell them and the whole world</i>

42:31.960 --> 42:35.120
<i>that my alibi for not having
murdered my ex-patient</i>

42:35.120 --> 42:37.600
<i>was that I was having sex
with another ex-patient,</i>

42:37.600 --> 42:40.360
<i>who just happens to be a sex worker.
Joe, she solves your problem.</i>

42:40.360 --> 42:41.880
<i>Take the hit and move on...</i>

42:41.880 --> 42:44.000
<i>Cara will never be believed.</i>

42:44.000 --> 42:46.320
<i>She'd be the worst possible alibi.</i>

42:46.320 --> 42:49.080
<i>But she IS your alibi!
Oh, God...</i>

42:49.080 --> 42:51.160
<i>Look, I know
you've always been the good guy,</i>

42:51.160 --> 42:53.320
<i>and now, you know,
you've been caught out,</i>

42:53.320 --> 42:55.400
<i>but I promise you...
Yeah, they're gonna love that,</i>

42:55.400 --> 42:57.080
<i>aren't they?
They're gonna be lining up.</i>

42:57.080 --> 42:58.920
<i>I'll be struck off,
I'll lose everything,</i>

42:58.920 --> 43:01.120
<i>the press will have a field day.
I'm not doing it, Jack.</i>

43:01.120 --> 43:03.440
<i>I'm not giving them
the satisfaction of humiliating me.</i>

43:03.440 --> 43:05.160
<i>Who's "them"?</i>

43:05.160 --> 43:07.320
<i>Bobby Moran and whoever else
is setting me up.</i>

43:07.320 --> 43:10.000
<i>Bobby Moran has a cast-iron alibi,
so, clearly, it's not him.</i>

43:10.000 --> 43:11.680
<i>He is involved somehow.</i>

43:11.680 --> 43:13.360
<i>I know he is, and-and...</i>

43:13.360 --> 43:16.520
<i>I mean, if he's not,
what do we have?</i>

43:16.520 --> 43:20.240
<i>All we have is the madness
of Catherine McCain killing herself</i>

43:20.240 --> 43:22.040
<i>to get back at me.
I'm not buying that.</i>

43:23.360 --> 43:25.440
<i>This is a well-planned nightmare.</i>

43:27.000 --> 43:30.320
<i>Right, "a well-planned nightmare".
Joe...</i>

43:32.760 --> 43:35.920
<i>Who on Earth
would want to do that to you?</i>

43:37.320 --> 43:38.720
<i>I don't know.</i>

43:51.440 --> 43:53.240
<i>Morning, Meena.</i>

43:53.240 --> 43:55.000
<i>Joe?</i>

43:56.360 --> 43:57.520
<i>Um...</i>

43:59.160 --> 44:01.200
<i>Given the circumstances...</i>

44:01.200 --> 44:03.600
<i>Yeah. I get it.</i>

44:03.600 --> 44:05.320
<i>Being walked down the aisle</i>

44:05.320 --> 44:08.200
<i>by a man with a coat over his head
isn't the look you were going for.</i>

44:08.200 --> 44:11.800
<i>What? No, um... the, er...</i>

44:11.800 --> 44:14.920
<i>the partners would like to meet
to talk things through with you.</i>

44:14.920 --> 44:17.440
<i>They've heard about your arrest.
Oh, shit.</i>

44:17.440 --> 44:20.120
<i>I know. God, you look dreadful.</i>

44:22.360 --> 44:23.920
<i>Wh...</i>

44:23.920 --> 44:26.880
<i>Yesterday was my last day.
Just came to collect my things.</i>

44:26.880 --> 44:28.760
<i>Got a patient waiting.</i>

44:33.800 --> 44:35.760
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

44:38.960 --> 44:40.840
<i>I have an appointment.</i>

44:55.680 --> 44:56.760
<i>Wow, look at that.</i>

44:56.760 --> 44:58.520
<i>You haven't been honest with me,
have you?</i>

44:58.520 --> 45:00.880
<i>Put that down, please. Oh...</i>

45:00.880 --> 45:02.840
<i>What?
Are you afraid in case I bury it</i>

45:02.840 --> 45:05.000
<i>in your head, Joe,
is that what it is?</i>

45:06.800 --> 45:09.760
<i>Joe, is that who you think I am, eh?</i>

45:09.760 --> 45:11.400
<i>You think I could do something
like that</i>

45:11.400 --> 45:13.760
<i>because that-that's
what you told the police, isn't it?</i>

45:13.760 --> 45:17.880
<i>I was arrested because of the things
that you said about me.</i>

45:19.040 --> 45:21.360
<i>And I've been advised
by my solicitor to sue,</i>

45:21.360 --> 45:23.720
<i>breach of confidentiality.</i>

45:23.720 --> 45:26.080
<i>I'm here to make up my mind.</i>

45:26.080 --> 45:27.920
<i>What do you know
about Catherine McCain?</i>

45:27.920 --> 45:29.520
<i>I know nothing
about Catherine McCain!</i>

45:29.520 --> 45:31.280
<i>You have been telling me
a pack of lies.</i>

45:31.280 --> 45:32.360
<i>I don't know who she is.</i>

45:32.360 --> 45:34.160
<i>Why have you been doing that?
Boop, boop.</i>

45:34.160 --> 45:36.240
<i>It's jumping, isn't it?
Isn't that what your job is?</i>

45:36.240 --> 45:37.840
<i>To work out what's true
and what isn't?</i>

45:37.840 --> 45:40.000
<i>No, that's the job of the patient. Mm.</i>

45:40.000 --> 45:42.440
<i>Is there somebody
manipulating you, Bobby?</i>

45:42.440 --> 45:43.640
<i>Making you do bad things?</i>

45:43.640 --> 45:45.680
<i>Yeah, you're the one
who's manipulating me!</i>

45:45.680 --> 45:47.160
<i>No, I am trying to help you.</i>

45:47.160 --> 45:48.560
<i>HE GIGGLES, GRUMBLES</i>

45:48.560 --> 45:51.040
<i>"Now, Bobby, don't tell lies.
Don't waste his time!</i>

45:51.040 --> 45:53.840
<i>"Just tell him what happened
and we can all go home.</i>

45:53.840 --> 45:56.960
<i>"Please!" If you know anything
about Catherine McCain's death,</i>

45:56.960 --> 45:58.800
<i>you need to tell me. Right now.</i>

45:58.800 --> 46:02.320
<i>I'm gonna take my brief's advice,
and I'm gonna make him sue you.</i>

46:15.960 --> 46:17.680
<i>What are you reading?</i>

46:17.680 --> 46:19.480
<i>O'Loughlin's book.
RUIS SCOFFS</i>

46:19.480 --> 46:20.840
<i>Any good?</i>

46:20.840 --> 46:24.560
<i>He goes into psychology
to help people with common phobias,</i>

46:24.560 --> 46:27.440
<i>because, age 14, he watches
his mum die in a house fire.</i>

46:29.320 --> 46:32.160
<i>We'll need to look into
how that fire got started.</i>

46:33.680 --> 46:35.920
<i>That's what a career in murder
does for you.</i>

46:38.600 --> 46:40.240
<i>'O'Loughlin trying
to set up Bobby Moran</i>

46:40.240 --> 46:42.600
<i>'as Catherine's killer
hasn't worked out for him, right?'</i>

46:42.600 --> 46:48.120
<i>So, he's gonna need a new plan,
more confusion, more misdirection.</i>

46:48.120 --> 46:51.280
<i>He'll try and convince everyone</i>

46:51.280 --> 46:53.280
<i>that he is the one
that's being set up.</i>

46:53.280 --> 46:55.800
<i>He might even try and
convince himself that he's innocent.</i>

46:55.800 --> 46:57.520
<i>But we'll stay on him.</i>

46:58.600 --> 47:00.520
<i>He'll slip up...</i>

47:00.520 --> 47:02.000
<i>and we'll have him.</i>
