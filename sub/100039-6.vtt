00:01.692 --> 00:03.209
Researchers have theorized

00:03.233 --> 00:05.190
that nightmares are the brain's way

00:05.214 --> 00:08.426
of processing
unsettling events of the past.

00:08.450 --> 00:09.794
Oh!

00:09.818 --> 00:11.863
Paula. What?

00:11.887 --> 00:13.364
You're scaring me.

00:13.388 --> 00:15.300
Happy Halloween.

00:15.324 --> 00:17.268
Anybody ever tell you,
you snore like a trucker?

00:17.292 --> 00:20.371
- Not in those exact words.
- Like a truck, then?

00:20.395 --> 00:21.606
I thought a semi
was barreling towards me.

00:21.630 --> 00:23.741
- You woke me up.
- I have allergies.

00:23.765 --> 00:25.076
Ohh.

00:25.100 --> 00:26.377
- What time is it?
- Does it matter?

00:26.401 --> 00:28.479
Yes. I'm getting out today.
I'm counting the minutes.

00:28.503 --> 00:30.281
Ooh! Well, I'll count, too.

00:30.305 --> 00:32.317
Once you leave, I'll be able to sleep.

00:35.611 --> 00:36.810
Others believe nightmares

00:36.834 --> 00:38.223
are how our subconscious mind

00:38.247 --> 00:40.291
prepares us to deal
with our real-life fears.

00:40.315 --> 00:41.159
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:41.183 --> 00:43.494
- Where are the kids?
- Daycare.

00:43.518 --> 00:44.912
What? So why'd you text about a hand-off?

00:44.943 --> 00:46.707
- To bring you this.
- What's this?

00:46.731 --> 00:48.041
My mom brought them over this morning...

00:48.065 --> 00:50.501
costumes from when Megan and I
were little kids.

00:50.525 --> 00:52.243
These are amazing.

00:52.243 --> 00:54.154
Yeah. She made them all from scratch.

00:54.178 --> 00:56.123
Your mom worked full-time

00:56.147 --> 00:57.258
and still managed to make costumes?

00:57.282 --> 00:58.759
Mm-hmm. Every year.

01:00.689 --> 01:02.296
I got to go.

01:02.320 --> 01:04.431
I guess I'll see you up on the
PEDS floor for trick-or-treating?

01:04.455 --> 01:05.366
Okay. Bye.

01:09.294 --> 01:11.105
Either way,

01:11.129 --> 01:13.774
they agree that nightmares
are most commonly brought on

01:13.798 --> 01:14.808
by one thing...

01:15.800 --> 01:17.211
...stress.

01:17.235 --> 01:18.378
Red or yellow tie?

01:18.402 --> 01:20.915
Mm. Why don't you
compromise, go with orange?

01:20.939 --> 01:22.283
Hey, can you come help me with my dress?

01:22.307 --> 01:23.417
What about blue?

01:29.113 --> 01:30.157
Boo!

01:30.181 --> 01:31.158
♪ Hey!

01:31.182 --> 01:32.993
Seriously?

01:33.017 --> 01:34.995
You can't even pretend to be scared?

01:35.019 --> 01:37.064
Nothing's scarier than my real life.

01:37.088 --> 01:40.167
I got half a dozen investors
coming to see Pac North today.

01:40.191 --> 01:42.036
Gotta convince them
to sink more money into it.

01:42.060 --> 01:44.271
You found a janitor
giving himself a CT scan.

01:44.295 --> 01:46.073
That place has nowhere to go but up.

01:46.097 --> 01:48.542
Hey, have you seen my wedding shoes?

01:48.566 --> 01:50.044
Why are you wearing your wedding dress?

01:50.068 --> 01:51.112
Uh, it's expensive.

01:51.136 --> 01:52.146
I'm gonna wear it every Halloween.

01:52.170 --> 01:53.380
- To work?
- No. I have the day off.

01:53.404 --> 01:55.883
I'm gonna stay home,
I'm gonna eat most of the candy,

01:55.907 --> 01:57.574
and scare all the trick-or-treaters.

02:02.580 --> 02:04.258
- Love you.
- Love you.

02:06.851 --> 02:08.228
How come my mom hasn't called

02:08.252 --> 02:10.396
from sleepover community service?

02:10.420 --> 02:12.199
Oh, she's probably busy.

02:12.223 --> 02:14.034
It's not like a slumber party
with friends.

02:14.058 --> 02:15.669
Oh. That's your ride.

02:15.693 --> 02:17.281
Okay, everybody, get your stuff together.

02:17.305 --> 02:19.039
Come on, guys. Get your backpacks.

02:19.063 --> 02:20.280
I hope we get candy at school.

02:20.304 --> 02:22.109
Oh, did you guys forget
your candy? Go get your candy.

02:22.133 --> 02:24.278
- Candy! Come on.
- Let's go, guys.

02:24.302 --> 02:25.245
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:25.269 --> 02:26.413
I am so sorry that I'm late.

02:26.437 --> 02:27.548
I had to borrow Carina's car.

02:27.572 --> 02:28.764
How are the kids?

02:28.788 --> 02:30.517
Hair is brushed. Lunches are packed.

02:30.541 --> 02:32.152
Halloween costumes are on.

02:32.176 --> 02:34.088
I am killing the auntie game,
right, ZoZo?

02:34.112 --> 02:37.314
Yeah, but are you gonna get dressed?

02:40.030 --> 02:41.295
Good idea.

02:41.319 --> 02:42.896
I'm gonna go get dressed,

02:42.920 --> 02:45.432
and Dr. DeLuca is gonna
take you to school, okay?

02:45.456 --> 02:47.234
Okay.

02:47.258 --> 02:48.469
Okay.

02:48.493 --> 02:49.549
Hey.

02:49.573 --> 02:51.138
- Need some help with that?
- Don't!

02:51.162 --> 02:53.107
You're not my dad.

02:54.632 --> 02:55.876
Okay.

02:55.900 --> 02:58.412
All right, let's get the rest
of your stuff together, guys.

03:01.239 --> 03:02.973
All right, let's go.

03:04.776 --> 03:06.253
And then I reminded her

03:06.277 --> 03:08.589
that I'm going to Capitol Hill
with Nico for Halloween,

03:08.613 --> 03:10.157
and she got all weird.

03:10.181 --> 03:12.259
She's sad you're not helping her
hand out candy.

03:12.283 --> 03:13.535
Well, that's what I thought,

03:13.559 --> 03:15.929
but then she asked me
not to post pictures.

03:15.953 --> 03:18.298
She said a lot of our family follows me.

03:18.322 --> 03:19.767
She doesn't want them to know

03:19.791 --> 03:21.435
you still dress up for Halloween?

03:21.459 --> 03:23.570
Yeah, if by "still dress up
for Halloween"

03:23.594 --> 03:25.172
you mean "are gay,"

03:25.196 --> 03:26.351
then I think so.

03:26.375 --> 03:28.308
- I thought she was cool with it.
- Yeah.

03:28.332 --> 03:29.476
So did I.

03:30.401 --> 03:33.247
I'm not gonna let her ruin Halloween.

03:33.271 --> 03:34.373
I'm gonna power through rounds

03:34.397 --> 03:36.683
so that I can leave early and meet Nico.

03:36.707 --> 03:38.930
Mm. What's your costume?

03:38.954 --> 03:40.320
It's a paladin.

03:40.344 --> 03:42.256
From "Dungeons & Dragons."

03:42.280 --> 03:44.425
It's a subclass of fighter
who has the ability

03:44.449 --> 03:46.093
to heal wounds and cure diseases.

03:46.117 --> 03:47.461
So it's a nerd suit.

03:47.485 --> 03:49.363
They can detect evil.

03:49.387 --> 03:50.631
Oh.

03:52.457 --> 03:54.835
We, uh, revamped ER triage protocols

03:54.859 --> 03:56.170
to improve patient flow.

03:56.194 --> 03:57.738
That reduced wait times by 10%.

03:57.762 --> 04:00.174
Okay, no more candy corn
in your nose, bud.

04:01.559 --> 04:03.190
- Got it.

04:04.235 --> 04:07.181
Oh, no, no, no, don't do... that.

04:07.757 --> 04:08.926
Uh...

04:08.950 --> 04:12.219
Dr. Webber is, uh, enhancing
the education program

04:12.243 --> 04:14.388
to include doctor-patient communication

04:14.412 --> 04:15.589
and other soft skills.

04:15.613 --> 04:17.791
And with, uh, additional funding,

04:17.815 --> 04:19.459
we can upgrade the skills lab

04:19.483 --> 04:21.261
to improve surgical technique.

04:21.285 --> 04:22.830
Well, unless there are any questions,

04:22.854 --> 04:25.199
we will go see construction
on the new research wing,

04:25.223 --> 04:27.868
which is not only on budget,
but ahead of schedule.

04:27.892 --> 04:29.303
Uh, Chief, a word?

04:29.327 --> 04:31.371
Uh, we're on our way to you now, Eddie.

04:31.395 --> 04:32.873
I think there's something you should see

04:32.897 --> 04:34.775
before anyone else does.

04:34.799 --> 04:37.377
Okay, well, they're not, uh,
quite ready for us yet,

04:37.401 --> 04:39.646
so Dr. Webber will take you
to see the ICU,

04:39.670 --> 04:41.448
and I will meet you guys there
in a few minutes.

04:41.472 --> 04:42.535
Okay.

04:42.559 --> 04:43.550
Uh, okay.

04:43.574 --> 04:45.352
Uh, the ICU is this way.

04:45.376 --> 04:46.720
Oh, God! No, no, no!

04:46.744 --> 04:47.788
You got to clamp it first!

04:47.812 --> 04:49.884
Oh, but, uh, you know,
if we go in this direction,

04:49.908 --> 04:52.326
I can show you our new MRI on the way.

04:52.350 --> 04:55.295
- Thanks.
- Thank you very much.

04:57.088 --> 04:58.065
Oh, my God.

04:58.089 --> 05:00.300
Dr. Chatmon to Radiology.

05:00.324 --> 05:01.401
Dr. Chatmon to Radiology.

05:01.425 --> 05:03.370
Shepherd, uh, you got a second?

05:03.394 --> 05:04.705
Bailey, are you okay?

05:04.729 --> 05:06.507
I... I'm sorry.

05:06.531 --> 05:09.977
Um... I'm... pregnant.

05:10.001 --> 05:12.379
And I hear you are, too. Congratulations.

05:12.403 --> 05:14.248
Thanks. You, too? That's...

05:14.272 --> 05:15.749
Are your ankles swollen?

05:15.773 --> 05:18.519
Do you have intense cravings
for root beer?

05:18.543 --> 05:21.855
Are you panicking about
how you finally have the career

05:21.879 --> 05:23.724
you've imagined for yourself,

05:23.748 --> 05:26.126
but will now be breastfeeding
for the next 12 months

05:26.150 --> 05:28.262
because the AAP strongly recommends it?

05:28.286 --> 05:30.297
Yes to all, but my cravings
are for pepperoni,

05:30.321 --> 05:31.431
which, historically, I hate.

05:31.455 --> 05:34.434
This morning, Tuck texted me a picture

05:34.458 --> 05:36.003
of him in his Halloween costume,

05:36.027 --> 05:37.204
and I burst into tears.

05:37.228 --> 05:39.039
That's the hormones. That's normal.

05:39.063 --> 05:40.407
Okay, well, I don't like it.

05:40.431 --> 05:43.610
I can't cry at work,
not in front of the staff

05:43.634 --> 05:45.779
and certainly not
in front of Tom Koracick.

05:45.803 --> 05:47.414
The last thing I need

05:47.438 --> 05:50.784
is for the self-proclaimed
chief of chiefs

05:50.808 --> 05:52.753
to see me reduced to a puddle of tears.

05:52.777 --> 05:54.688
Isn't "chief of chiefs" his actual title?

05:55.713 --> 05:57.424
Right. Not the point. Okay.

05:57.448 --> 05:58.492
If you feel like you're gonna cry,

05:58.516 --> 06:00.460
try pressing your tongue
to the roof of your mouth.

06:00.484 --> 06:03.096
You can also try
looking up at the ceiling.

06:04.388 --> 06:06.466
Okay. I'll try it.

06:06.490 --> 06:08.435
You know, all I wanted to do was vent,

06:08.459 --> 06:10.437
and you gave me useful advice.

06:10.461 --> 06:12.272
Thank you.

06:14.865 --> 06:15.961
What...

06:19.170 --> 06:21.114
Dr. Sutton to the Step-down Unit.

06:21.138 --> 06:23.162
Dr. Sutton to the Step-down Unit.

06:23.186 --> 06:24.585
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:24.609 --> 06:26.620
- Lunch today?
- Sure. Yeah.

06:26.644 --> 06:28.088
- My afternoon's clear.
- Great.

06:28.112 --> 06:30.123
Uh, my parents' reservation's for 12:30,

06:30.147 --> 06:31.725
so see you in the lobby at noon?

06:31.749 --> 06:33.894
- This lunch is with your parents?
- Yeah.

06:33.918 --> 06:36.096
Remember when I did that for you?

06:36.120 --> 06:37.297
I thought your parents hated each other.

06:37.321 --> 06:39.199
They do, but it's my cancer-versary.

06:39.223 --> 06:40.200
Oh.

06:40.224 --> 06:42.336
Uh, that's... What is that?

06:42.360 --> 06:44.104
That's the anniversary
of my doctor telling us

06:44.128 --> 06:45.505
that my scans were clear.

06:45.529 --> 06:47.341
- We go to lunch every year.
- That's nice.

06:47.365 --> 06:50.177
It is... for the first 15 minutes.

06:50.201 --> 06:51.778
Then it turns into a competition

06:51.802 --> 06:54.314
to prove whose life is better
since the divorce.

06:54.338 --> 06:56.183
But this year will be different, though.

06:56.207 --> 06:57.718
Because they will both hate me?

06:57.742 --> 06:59.753
I am terrible with parents.

06:59.777 --> 07:02.348
Because we'll tell them about the baby.

07:02.372 --> 07:03.484
Lobby at noon?

07:03.508 --> 07:05.192
Yay!

07:05.216 --> 07:07.027
Right. They are gonna love you.

07:08.152 --> 07:09.363
Dr. Daimers...

07:09.387 --> 07:11.531
Dr. Daimers...

07:11.555 --> 07:12.733
Really?

07:12.757 --> 07:14.768
They have to special-order
the UV coating that we need.

07:14.792 --> 07:16.036
We're kind of at their mercy, Anne.

07:16.060 --> 07:17.153
That's ridiculous.

07:17.178 --> 07:18.506
- I-I-I know that.
- Whoa. It is dark in here.

07:18.531 --> 07:19.682
I know that,
but what else are we supposed to...

07:19.706 --> 07:21.875
Excuse us. I'm sorry. Good morning.

07:21.899 --> 07:24.678
Dr. Schmitt's gonna go ahead
and get us started today.

07:24.702 --> 07:27.381
Mary Rose Hawkins-Garrett, age 11,

07:27.405 --> 07:30.550
diagnosed at 6 months
with xeroderma pigmentosum,

07:30.574 --> 07:33.553
making her unable to withstand UV light

07:33.577 --> 07:35.689
without risk of severe burns
or skin cancer,

07:35.713 --> 07:37.864
which is why we have
the curtains for protection.

07:37.888 --> 07:39.949
Okay. Mind if I go ahead and take a look?

07:41.852 --> 07:43.263
Mary Rose was admitted

07:43.287 --> 07:44.865
for second-degree burns on her arms,

07:44.889 --> 07:47.167
due to apparent UV exposure.

07:47.191 --> 07:48.359
We don't know how it happened.

07:48.383 --> 07:50.037
I mean, she's never out
in the sun without...

07:50.061 --> 07:52.072
- Mnh-mnh.
- ...protective clothing and sunscreen.

07:52.096 --> 07:53.607
Where's Dr. Alex?

07:53.631 --> 07:55.876
You know what?
Dr. Alex just started a new job

07:55.900 --> 07:56.977
at another hospital.

07:57.001 --> 07:59.579
Oh. He's been her doctor
since she was born.

07:59.603 --> 08:02.316
Did he quit because of the
"hospital from hell" article?

08:02.340 --> 08:03.750
Something like that.

08:03.774 --> 08:04.785
Mhph.

08:04.809 --> 08:06.586
So, by the looks of it,

08:06.610 --> 08:09.556
this UV exposure's happened
in the last couple days,

08:09.580 --> 08:12.125
certainly long enough
for your arms to get infected.

08:12.149 --> 08:14.528
It's a large enough area that
I think we'll need to debride

08:14.552 --> 08:15.995
in an operating room.

08:17.088 --> 08:18.326
She needs surgery?

08:18.350 --> 08:20.067
You really don't know
how this happened, huh?

08:20.091 --> 08:21.735
No. We're careful.

08:21.759 --> 08:24.071
- Dr. Karev knows.
- Okay.

08:24.095 --> 08:26.506
Will I be done in time to trick-or-treat?

08:26.530 --> 08:29.276
Halloween's the one night
where all the kids are outside,

08:29.300 --> 08:31.645
and I can be with them without
my stupid protective helmet.

08:31.669 --> 08:33.212
Oh, even if Dr. Avery and I

08:33.236 --> 08:35.082
work as fast as we possibly can,

08:35.106 --> 08:36.515
y-you're probably still
gonna have to stay,

08:36.539 --> 08:38.385
uh, a night or...

08:38.409 --> 08:39.669
You know what?

08:40.390 --> 08:43.336
The hospital does have
a pretty great Halloween party.

08:43.361 --> 08:45.573
I mean, it's got games
and trick-or-treating.

08:45.598 --> 08:47.776
And we've got a really cool
costume parade.

08:47.801 --> 08:50.346
And I'm pretty sure
there's no helmet required.

08:50.371 --> 08:51.624
- Is that right?
- Nope.

08:51.655 --> 08:54.634
Yeah. So, uh, how's that sound?
Pretty good?

08:54.658 --> 08:55.854
All right.

08:55.878 --> 08:58.271
Well, Dr. DeLuca will go ahead
and get you started,

08:58.295 --> 08:59.529
- and I'll see you in a minute.
- Thank you.

09:00.598 --> 09:02.079
There's no party.

09:02.103 --> 09:04.611
Dr. Karev always assigned it
to a resident,

09:04.635 --> 09:06.580
and he's not here anymore, so...

09:06.604 --> 09:08.248
So you'll make sure it happens.

09:08.272 --> 09:10.317
- Oh, I have plans.
- I know.

09:10.341 --> 09:11.741
I just gave them to you.

09:19.617 --> 09:21.128
Eddie, why isn't anyone working?

09:21.152 --> 09:23.520
I told the investors
we were ahead of schedule.

09:26.557 --> 09:27.801
There.

09:27.825 --> 09:29.503
Yeah. What is it?

09:29.527 --> 09:32.606
Well, I'm no doctor,
but I think that's a skull.

09:32.630 --> 09:34.775
That's another one.

09:34.799 --> 09:37.944
And that's... a lot more.

09:42.640 --> 09:44.359
You want us to keep working?

09:44.887 --> 09:46.219
Yeah, I'm... I'm gonna need a minute.

09:50.581 --> 09:57.613

09:58.001 --> 10:00.083
They call these "fun size,"

10:00.423 --> 10:01.700
but they'd be more fun
if they were bigger.

10:02.839 --> 10:04.002
Are you sure you don't want one?

10:04.026 --> 10:06.171
I prefer not to lose my teeth.

10:12.702 --> 10:14.811
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Let's get you back on that gurney.

10:14.835 --> 10:17.482
No. My leg's just a little scraped up.
This is all fake. It's my friend.

10:17.506 --> 10:20.591
Austin Goodrich, 18,
auto versus pedestrian.

10:20.638 --> 10:21.882
He's got visible head trauma.

10:21.906 --> 10:22.849
Left pupil's blown.

10:22.873 --> 10:25.518
Hypotensive and tachy
despite 500 cc of LR,

10:25.542 --> 10:26.920
likely due to abdominal bleeding.

10:26.944 --> 10:28.555
Oh, you mean where that giant ax is?

10:28.579 --> 10:31.091
That is not real,
but also difficult to remove.

10:31.115 --> 10:32.893
We were walking to school
when this car plowed into him.

10:32.917 --> 10:34.261
Driver said he just didn't see him.

10:34.285 --> 10:36.263
Austin always wins our costume contest.

10:36.287 --> 10:38.565
He's, like, a master of
fake blood and guts and organs.

10:38.589 --> 10:40.133
Is he gonna be okay?

10:40.157 --> 10:42.202
We'll know more when we take
a look at his real organs.

10:42.226 --> 10:43.570
Let's get him into trauma one!

10:44.962 --> 10:47.000
- Dr. Danforth to the ER.
- And to help them, we...

10:47.024 --> 10:48.508
Dr. Danforth to the ER.

10:48.532 --> 10:50.543
Uh, w-would you excuse me?

10:50.567 --> 10:52.112
Uh, M-Michaela? Over there.

10:52.136 --> 10:53.580
Thank you.

10:53.604 --> 10:55.215
- Oh.
- Go.

10:55.239 --> 10:56.416
I need advice

10:56.440 --> 10:58.334
on breaking bad news to the investors.

10:58.358 --> 10:59.452
Hmm.

10:59.476 --> 11:01.288
Well, I've always found it's best

11:01.312 --> 11:02.520
to be up-front and straightforward.

11:02.544 --> 11:03.790
Investors would rather hear it from you

11:03.814 --> 11:05.659
than through the grapevine.
Why? What's happening?

11:05.683 --> 11:06.927
C-Construction is stopped

11:06.951 --> 11:08.943
due to a... a... a mass grave.

11:09.987 --> 11:11.097
A... A what, now?

11:11.121 --> 11:13.767
The new wing is apparently
on a... a burial ground

11:13.791 --> 11:15.186
from, uh, 100 years ago.

11:16.293 --> 11:17.737
You're pranking me for Halloween, right?

11:17.761 --> 11:19.472
This was once apparently
a mental hospital,

11:19.496 --> 11:21.675
and once people died
and nobody came for them and...

11:21.699 --> 11:23.376
Ugh. Yeah.

11:23.400 --> 11:25.946
Well, you definitely don't
want to tell the investors that.

11:25.970 --> 11:30.109
O-Okay, y-you handle it,
and... and I'll keep them busy.

11:30.133 --> 11:32.919
Sure explains why this place
feels haunted.

11:32.943 --> 11:34.988
It's not haunted.

11:39.350 --> 11:41.928
Help! Ohh! Someone help me!

11:41.952 --> 11:43.897
I'm bleeding so much!

11:43.921 --> 11:45.465
Ohh! Aah!

11:45.489 --> 11:47.701
Really?

11:47.725 --> 11:48.724
Seriously?

11:48.748 --> 11:50.470
Look how good this makeup is.

11:50.494 --> 11:52.539
You weren't even a little bit scared?
I'm a corpse.

11:52.563 --> 11:54.874
Well, it's kind of a dime
a dozen around here today.

11:54.898 --> 11:56.509
There's a graveyard
under our construction site.

11:56.533 --> 11:57.978
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

11:58.002 --> 11:59.346
And I'm waiting to hear back from County,

11:59.370 --> 12:00.613
and I don't have time for this.

12:02.339 --> 12:03.516
It's Hunt.

12:03.540 --> 12:06.019
Multiple patients crashing in the ICU.
Let's go.

12:06.043 --> 12:07.754
You know I don't work here, right?

12:07.778 --> 12:09.656
I don't have more room
for dead bodies today.

12:09.680 --> 12:11.089
Come on.

12:15.185 --> 12:16.730
Man, I don't want to tear his skin,

12:16.754 --> 12:18.665
but this is really stuck.

12:18.689 --> 12:20.367
I think it's spirit gum.

12:20.391 --> 12:23.066
Um, I-I need more alcohol wipes.

12:23.090 --> 12:24.204
What's spirit gum?

12:24.228 --> 12:25.326
If you're old enough to know what it is,

12:25.350 --> 12:27.474
you're too old for trick-or-treating.

12:27.498 --> 12:29.976
You want to put an age limit
on Halloween?

12:30.000 --> 12:31.440
A town in Canada did... 16.

12:31.464 --> 12:33.847
After that, it's just
panhandling in a costume.

12:33.871 --> 12:35.215
All right, he's bleeding from his belly.

12:35.239 --> 12:36.249
We need to get him to an OR.

12:36.273 --> 12:37.445
Tom, how much longer?

12:37.469 --> 12:39.013
To retract the scalp and the galea,

12:39.037 --> 12:40.854
create an osteotomy, incise the dura,

12:40.878 --> 12:42.245
and decompress the hematoma?

12:42.579 --> 12:44.313
I'm done.

12:48.419 --> 12:49.729
What happened?

12:49.753 --> 12:50.930
Ohh!

12:50.954 --> 12:53.146
See? That is the appropriate reaction.

12:53.170 --> 12:54.434
Cecil Taylor, my wife, Jo.

12:54.458 --> 12:56.603
Two patients crashed, and now a
bunch of have cardiac arrhythmias.

12:56.627 --> 12:58.271
- How many?
- All of them.

12:58.295 --> 12:59.672
And no idea why.

12:59.696 --> 13:01.708
Your hospital's haunted.

13:06.103 --> 13:09.164
I'm saying not everyone likes surprises.

13:09.188 --> 13:10.350
Sure.

13:10.374 --> 13:12.552
Just people who lack
a sense of adventure.

13:12.576 --> 13:14.721
- Oh, please.
- Oh!

13:14.745 --> 13:16.356
Hey, there he is.

13:16.380 --> 13:17.813
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

13:17.837 --> 13:18.980
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:19.004 --> 13:20.126
Eric.

13:20.150 --> 13:21.694
- So glad to meet you.
- You, too.

13:21.718 --> 13:22.962
Yeah.

13:23.987 --> 13:25.331
So, you must be Amelia.

13:25.355 --> 13:26.966
- Yes.
- I'm Maureen.

13:26.990 --> 13:30.209
- Hi.
- So glad that you could join us.

13:30.233 --> 13:32.605
Yeah. Me too.

13:32.629 --> 13:34.274
- Ahh.
- Okay.

13:34.298 --> 13:36.709
Ahh.

13:36.733 --> 13:40.246
I-I didn't even know
that Link was seeing anyone

13:40.270 --> 13:42.235
until today.

13:42.259 --> 13:43.450
How long has it been?

13:43.474 --> 13:46.519
Um a few months?

13:46.543 --> 13:48.321
But we've known each other
longer than that, though.

13:48.345 --> 13:49.622
Right.

13:49.646 --> 13:52.325
Yeah. Actually, my sister,

13:52.349 --> 13:54.160
uh, tried to set us up a year ago.

13:54.184 --> 13:57.097
Well, a lot can change in a year.

13:57.121 --> 13:58.498
Yeah!

13:58.522 --> 14:00.433
So much!

14:00.457 --> 14:02.735
A year ago, I was living with
my ex-husband and two kids.

14:04.294 --> 14:05.271
Uh, not our kids.

14:05.295 --> 14:08.508
Um, well, one is ours,
but, um, but mostly his.

14:08.532 --> 14:10.376
He's adopted... Leo.

14:10.400 --> 14:12.011
The other is Leo's birth mom.

14:12.035 --> 14:13.079
She was not with us very long,

14:13.103 --> 14:15.448
but, um, between her
running away and going to rehab,

14:15.472 --> 14:16.616
it was petty messy.

14:16.640 --> 14:19.634
Plus, um, Link was kind of
asking out my other sister.

14:21.712 --> 14:25.492
Sometimes things just work out better

14:25.516 --> 14:26.925
the second time around.

14:26.949 --> 14:29.496
Speaking of which...

14:29.520 --> 14:31.998
...I have some news.

14:32.022 --> 14:34.457
- Well, actually, um, so do...
- I...

14:34.821 --> 14:36.603
...am getting remarried.

14:39.337 --> 14:40.540
Oh, wow.

14:40.564 --> 14:42.041
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:42.065 --> 14:43.510
Congratulations!

14:43.534 --> 14:45.411
Do we have to talk about this now?

14:45.435 --> 14:47.313
Yeah, you know, it all
happened pretty quickly,

14:47.337 --> 14:49.782
but I'm feeling really good about it.

14:49.806 --> 14:53.653
And I know that you are gonna love him.

14:53.677 --> 14:55.378
Can't wait to meet him.

14:56.180 --> 14:58.005
You don't have to.

15:05.956 --> 15:07.367
Yeah.

15:07.391 --> 15:08.902
Surprise.

15:14.400 --> 15:16.627
She is lucky,
I mean, that's a hell of a burn,

15:16.652 --> 15:18.329
but not quite past the dermis.

15:18.837 --> 15:20.215
How's Grey handling lock-up?

15:20.239 --> 15:22.096
- Oh.
- I mean, she's great with a scalpel,

15:22.120 --> 15:24.031
but I can't picture her wielding a shiv.

15:24.055 --> 15:27.774
- No. No. I can, actually.
- It's hard to say.

15:27.799 --> 15:31.145
I mean, she's had about eight
minutes of phone time total,

15:31.169 --> 15:33.147
which she spent talking
to her kids, obviously.

15:33.171 --> 15:34.782
Right. So you're playing house
over there?

15:34.806 --> 15:36.184
I'm helping out when I can.

15:36.208 --> 15:37.919
Yeah. I'm not sure it's welcome.

15:37.943 --> 15:39.821
Zola looked like she wanted
to shiv me this morning.

15:39.845 --> 15:40.955
Really? Why?

15:40.979 --> 15:42.657
- What'd you do?
- No clue.

15:42.681 --> 15:44.959
Yeah, well, welcome to fatherhood, buddy.

15:44.983 --> 15:46.227
I'm not trying to be anyone's father.

15:46.251 --> 15:48.463
No, you're just taking care
of your girlfriend's children

15:48.487 --> 15:49.864
while she's behind bars.

15:49.888 --> 15:50.932
Totally different.

15:50.956 --> 15:52.676
- Okay.
- Gauze, please.

15:54.726 --> 15:56.137
With kids, it's hard to tell,

15:56.161 --> 15:58.873
but it's almost always for a reason.

15:58.897 --> 16:00.475
You just got to figure it out.

16:05.704 --> 16:07.582
We checked to make sure

16:07.606 --> 16:10.051
- his lip lac isn't real, right?
- Yeah.

16:10.075 --> 16:12.920
When did everyone start spending
so much time on costumes?

16:12.944 --> 16:14.188
What's Allison gonna be?

16:14.832 --> 16:16.023
A baby.

16:16.047 --> 16:17.525
Right.

16:17.549 --> 16:19.060
Lap pads.

16:19.084 --> 16:20.194
You know that Owen's mom

16:20.218 --> 16:21.996
made all of his and Megan's costumes

16:22.020 --> 16:23.229
when they were little?

16:23.253 --> 16:25.333
Like, put sheets over their heads

16:25.357 --> 16:26.901
- and called them ghosts?
- No.

16:26.925 --> 16:30.538
Sewed and glue-gunned and embroidered.

16:30.562 --> 16:32.673
She was an amazing Army nurse

16:32.697 --> 16:35.343
and a mom who made other moms feel inept.

16:35.367 --> 16:38.379
I don't think anyone
equates good costumes

16:38.403 --> 16:39.580
with good parenting.

16:39.604 --> 16:41.115
Well, Owen might. I have no idea.

16:41.139 --> 16:44.018
We went from best friends
to family of four

16:44.042 --> 16:45.185
almost overnight.

16:45.209 --> 16:46.921
There were many steps that were skipped,

16:46.945 --> 16:48.890
I mean, steps that would have prepared me

16:48.914 --> 16:50.548
for what we're doing right now,
which is...

16:51.750 --> 16:52.894
I have no idea what it is.

16:52.918 --> 16:54.566
Me neither.

16:55.289 --> 16:56.364
Tom, you were...

16:56.388 --> 16:59.100
you were so quiet that I forgot that...

16:59.124 --> 17:01.131
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

17:01.155 --> 17:02.570
And you are not "inept,"

17:02.594 --> 17:04.704
except maybe in your choice
of baby daddies.

17:04.729 --> 17:07.575
And don't let ginger beer or his mom

17:07.598 --> 17:08.943
make you feel any other way.

17:08.967 --> 17:10.545
I'm sorry. I-I shouldn't
have brought it up.

17:10.569 --> 17:13.247
It's just that... that those
costumes were so terrifying...

17:13.271 --> 17:15.116
and... and... and not in a Halloween way.

17:15.140 --> 17:17.117
Halloween's a phony holiday, anyway.

17:17.142 --> 17:19.353
Dangerous, too. Kids are twice as likely

17:19.377 --> 17:21.823
to be hit by a car and die
on Halloween as any other day.

17:21.847 --> 17:24.358
This kid's lucky we were here to
keep him alive... or at least I was.

17:24.382 --> 17:26.594
The ventriculostomy
is draining perfectly.

17:26.617 --> 17:28.429
I will be in the ER

17:28.453 --> 17:31.325
with the other Halloween casualties.

17:32.090 --> 17:34.101
How did you date that man?

17:34.125 --> 17:35.937
Well, he has his moments.

17:35.961 --> 17:38.039
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

17:38.063 --> 17:39.774
No, he really does have
some good qualities.

17:39.798 --> 17:40.942
No.

17:40.966 --> 17:42.777
Pancreatic head looks severed.

17:42.801 --> 17:44.479
Probably blunt-force trauma

17:44.503 --> 17:46.914
from him falling onto the plastic ax.

17:46.938 --> 17:49.817
It basically caused half a Whipple.

17:49.841 --> 17:51.853
All right. What do we do?

17:52.978 --> 17:54.422
Well, we don't have a choice.

17:54.446 --> 17:55.790
We have to finish a Whipple.

17:57.000 --> 18:03.074

18:04.222 --> 18:05.433
You staring at that clock's

18:05.457 --> 18:06.934
not gonna make it go any faster.

18:06.958 --> 18:08.970
There isn't really much else to do here.

18:08.994 --> 18:10.771
You could help me with this puzzle,

18:10.795 --> 18:12.406
stop wearing out that floor.

18:13.105 --> 18:14.675
Hey, hey!

18:14.699 --> 18:15.710
Hi.

18:15.734 --> 18:17.111
Um, I'm Meredith Grey.

18:17.135 --> 18:19.904
I'm supposed to get out now, actually.

18:22.507 --> 18:23.851
Paperwork's not here.

18:23.875 --> 18:25.119
Where is it?

18:25.143 --> 18:26.839
Hasn't arrived from court.

18:27.679 --> 18:28.789
Should I call my lawyer?

18:28.813 --> 18:30.091
It'll show up. Happens all the time.

18:30.115 --> 18:31.792
Okay. But, wait. Hold on.

18:31.816 --> 18:33.160
It's... You know, it's Halloween,

18:33.184 --> 18:34.495
and I have three kids at home,

18:34.519 --> 18:36.097
and they shouldn't have to suffer

18:36.121 --> 18:37.164
for the court's mistake.

18:37.188 --> 18:38.220
I have to get a costume.

18:38.244 --> 18:39.435
You could go as "sad mom."

18:41.293 --> 18:42.870
Is anyone in your family sick?

18:42.894 --> 18:44.739
I'm a doctor. I could help.

18:44.763 --> 18:46.340
I like it better
on this side of the bars.

18:47.866 --> 18:50.945
You're a doctor?

18:50.969 --> 18:52.947
- Yeah. You need help?
- No.

18:52.971 --> 18:54.549
I'm just wondering
how the hell you let yourself

18:54.573 --> 18:55.623
get locked in here.

18:59.945 --> 19:02.089
Dead bodies like corpses
or murder victims?

19:02.113 --> 19:04.392
No one was murdered. Get back to work.

19:04.416 --> 19:06.093
- You figure out what happened?
- Not yet.

19:06.117 --> 19:07.209
It's kind of a war zone here.

19:07.233 --> 19:08.863
Your hospital's creepy.

19:08.887 --> 19:10.398
- You're not helping that situation.
- Okay.

19:10.422 --> 19:11.966
Those are the patients who are okay.

19:11.990 --> 19:13.334
Those are the ones who had arrhythmias.

19:13.358 --> 19:14.502
These had jaundice.

19:14.526 --> 19:16.103
Those had fevers.

19:16.127 --> 19:17.572
Huh.

19:17.596 --> 19:19.407
What? You see something?

19:19.431 --> 19:20.975
The pink.

19:20.999 --> 19:22.810
Transfusion forms.

19:22.834 --> 19:24.011
All these patients got blood.

19:24.035 --> 19:25.122
We've gotta call Central Blood Supply,

19:25.146 --> 19:26.194
see if there's anything's wrong with...

19:26.218 --> 19:28.249
Actually, we have our own blood supply.

19:28.273 --> 19:29.540
It's in the floor's medical fridge.

19:29.564 --> 19:31.252
- Okay. Where's that?
- We need to see it.

19:32.744 --> 19:33.921
- Damn it. It's another V-fib.
- I'll get it.

19:33.945 --> 19:35.323
You guys check on the blood.

19:39.217 --> 19:42.129
Uh, Link said you live
in different cities,

19:42.153 --> 19:43.731
so how did you two, um...

19:43.755 --> 19:47.401
I moved to Denver for my job
earlier this year.

19:47.425 --> 19:49.236
I didn't know anybody there,

19:49.260 --> 19:51.572
so, uh, I signed up for
one of those dating apps.

19:51.596 --> 19:54.442
First person they matched me
with was Maureen.

19:54.466 --> 19:56.877
I swiped left. Been there, done that.

19:56.901 --> 19:58.179
I switched apps.

19:58.203 --> 20:00.715
I figured that one's algorithm was bad.

20:00.739 --> 20:02.717
But the next one matched us, too.

20:02.741 --> 20:05.186
And then when we matched a third time,

20:05.210 --> 20:07.622
I texted him to laugh
about these dumb apps,

20:07.646 --> 20:09.724
and he suggested that we have coffee.

20:09.748 --> 20:13.594
And, uh, turns out the apps
weren't so dumb.

20:15.920 --> 20:17.098
We've already had a big wedding,

20:17.122 --> 20:19.368
so this one's gonna be low-key.

20:20.358 --> 20:23.706
But I would love for you
to be my best man.

20:25.897 --> 20:27.508
Ooh.

20:34.272 --> 20:36.260
You two, uh...

20:37.676 --> 20:40.888
put me through hell with your divorce.

20:40.912 --> 20:42.156
You used me like a pawn.

20:42.180 --> 20:43.758
You... You made me a go-between.

20:43.782 --> 20:45.593
You forced me to pick sides.

20:45.617 --> 20:47.762
I spent Christmas days on an airplane

20:47.786 --> 20:49.764
so I could have breakfast with you

20:49.788 --> 20:51.065
and dinner with you.

20:51.089 --> 20:54.602
I double-majored in college

20:54.626 --> 20:57.805
So you could go to separate
graduation ceremonies.

20:57.829 --> 21:01.475
It took me years to learn
how to manage parents

21:01.499 --> 21:02.743
who could barely sit through a lunch

21:02.767 --> 21:04.278
without tearing each other apart,

21:04.302 --> 21:05.446
and now... now...

21:05.470 --> 21:10.351
now you're...
you're getting back together?

21:10.375 --> 21:12.253
I don't... I don't even know what to say.

21:12.277 --> 21:15.156
I think they just want you
to say you're happy...

21:15.180 --> 21:17.158
No, no, no, they... they don't
get to tell me what to say.

21:17.182 --> 21:18.993
They gave up that right
when they sat me down

21:19.017 --> 21:20.728
and told me our family
was a "painful lie,"

21:20.752 --> 21:22.296
which, together or not,

21:22.320 --> 21:24.455
we are never gonna do to our kid.

21:25.523 --> 21:26.801
Oh, yeah.

21:26.825 --> 21:28.125
You're gonna be grandparents.

21:29.694 --> 21:31.895
You know what? I need some air.

21:35.233 --> 21:37.178
Surprise!

21:37.202 --> 21:38.279
Huh.

21:42.624 --> 21:45.763
Okay. Temperature gauge
seems to be working.

21:45.788 --> 21:47.299
Yeah. Feels cool.

21:47.324 --> 21:49.569
Wait. It's zero degrees Celsius.

21:49.602 --> 21:51.013
It's supposed to be between 1 and 6.

21:51.037 --> 21:52.619
It's gone bad.

21:52.644 --> 21:55.389
The blood hemolyzed. We basically
pumped them with straight potassium.

21:55.413 --> 21:58.059
A few more minutes, and the ICU
would be nothing but corpses.

21:58.083 --> 21:59.694
And I've already got a backyard
full of those.

21:59.718 --> 22:00.962
Okay, we're gonna need labs for anyone

22:00.986 --> 22:03.297
who's been given blood from this
fridge in the past 24 hours.

22:03.321 --> 22:05.633
From now on, every department
uses Central Blood Supply.

22:05.657 --> 22:07.301
That's why it's there.

22:08.660 --> 22:13.107
Anastomosis looks patent and intact.

22:13.131 --> 22:15.905
I mean, this has got to be
a parent's worse nightmare.

22:15.929 --> 22:17.812
Do you worry about Tuck
trick-or-treating?

22:17.836 --> 22:19.880
My son and his girlfriend

22:19.904 --> 22:22.250
are going to horror night in the park.

22:22.274 --> 22:23.519
They're both zombies

22:23.543 --> 22:26.654
because they wanted to do
a couple's costume.

22:26.678 --> 22:28.856
I have... ugh...

22:28.880 --> 22:30.858
other things to worry about.

22:37.355 --> 22:39.166
I need, uh, drains

22:39.190 --> 22:40.201
and 3-0 nylon.

22:40.225 --> 22:42.303
You know what?

22:42.327 --> 22:43.471
Don't worry about the costume.

22:43.495 --> 22:47.308
There's never enough time
to do everything you want,

22:47.332 --> 22:48.409
so spend it with your babies.

22:48.433 --> 22:52.102
That's more important
than any perfect costume.

22:54.955 --> 22:56.037
All right.

22:56.075 --> 22:57.785
It's not the prettiest gastro-J.

22:57.809 --> 22:59.787
But it got the job done.

23:02.380 --> 23:05.726
So, I was picking up trash

23:05.750 --> 23:07.561
for my community service.

23:07.585 --> 23:10.197
And I'm waiting
for the medical commission

23:10.221 --> 23:12.833
to decide whether or not
to take my license,

23:12.857 --> 23:13.968
which I can't lose,

23:13.992 --> 23:16.804
because I have three kids
and I love being a surgeon.

23:16.828 --> 23:20.464
I would miss the OR and miss my patients.

23:22.400 --> 23:23.511
Do you have kids?

23:24.428 --> 23:26.247
Two.

23:26.271 --> 23:28.672
And two jobs to make ends meet.

23:31.351 --> 23:33.788
One night, my childcare fell through.

23:33.812 --> 23:35.323
I couldn't find a babysitter

23:35.347 --> 23:37.558
or a sub for the graveyard shift
at the mini-mart,

23:37.582 --> 23:41.429
so I put my two kids to bed,
and I went to work.

23:41.453 --> 23:43.998
I was less than a block away.

23:44.022 --> 23:47.268
I ran back and checked on them
every break I had.

23:47.292 --> 23:48.836
But my 8-year-old woke up and called 911

23:48.860 --> 23:50.595
when he saw I wasn't home.

23:50.619 --> 23:52.006
Oh, no.

23:52.030 --> 23:53.341
I tried explaining it to the police,

23:53.365 --> 23:55.876
but they were in no mood to listen.

23:57.469 --> 23:59.513
One of them came towards me.

23:59.537 --> 24:04.218
I guess I waved him off, out of instinct.

24:04.242 --> 24:08.055
My hand hit his face...
not hard or anything.

24:09.314 --> 24:10.691
But they arrested me,

24:10.715 --> 24:13.094
said I assaulted a police officer.

24:13.118 --> 24:14.962
And a jury found you guilty of that?

24:14.986 --> 24:16.814
I haven't had a hearing yet.

24:17.422 --> 24:20.735
I can't afford bail, so I'm stuck here.

24:20.759 --> 24:22.903
And my kids are in foster care.

24:22.927 --> 24:24.271
Public defender says

24:24.295 --> 24:25.773
it's gonna be probably another month.

24:25.797 --> 24:27.241
So...

24:29.467 --> 24:30.978
you can keep whining

24:31.002 --> 24:33.013
about how you might lose
your medical license,

24:33.037 --> 24:36.584
but I'm gonna stop listening
and focus on this puzzle.

24:55.693 --> 24:57.071
I don't know why I'm so mad.

24:57.095 --> 24:58.299
When I was a kid,

24:58.323 --> 25:00.508
all I wanted was for them
to get back together.

25:00.532 --> 25:02.276
I even tried to "Parent Trap" them.

25:02.818 --> 25:04.612
Seriously?

25:04.636 --> 25:06.080
I separately talked them into taking me

25:06.104 --> 25:09.150
to the same showing
of "Sleepless in Seattle."

25:09.174 --> 25:12.019
But my dad hated rom-come,
and my mom hated my dad,

25:12.043 --> 25:14.344
so it didn't work out very well.

25:17.148 --> 25:19.894
I don't think you're angry
about them getting remarried.

25:19.918 --> 25:22.296
Uh, I'm pretty sure that
they're the root of this anger.

25:24.022 --> 25:27.050
This day is supposed to be about you.

25:27.959 --> 25:29.203
You are their kid.

25:29.227 --> 25:32.339
You survived cancer.

25:32.363 --> 25:34.208
And they are making your cancer-versary

25:34.232 --> 25:36.710
all about them... again.

25:36.734 --> 25:37.778
Yeah.

25:37.802 --> 25:39.447
For somebody who says
they're terrible with parents,

25:39.471 --> 25:41.064
you seem to understand mine pretty well.

25:42.440 --> 25:45.527
Well, I understand family dysfunction.

25:49.714 --> 25:51.950
If you want to just leave, we can.

25:55.220 --> 25:58.624
Or you can give them
a chance to do better.

26:02.494 --> 26:04.338
Dr. Curt Sullivan to...

26:04.362 --> 26:05.539
Dr. Curt Sullivan to...

26:05.563 --> 26:07.475
Ah. Oh, geez.

26:07.499 --> 26:09.143
Ohh.

26:11.370 --> 26:13.370
_

26:13.404 --> 26:14.682
_

26:14.706 --> 26:16.484
_

26:16.508 --> 26:17.749
Are you a doctor?

26:19.143 --> 26:21.255
Yeah. I'm Dr. Schmitt.

26:21.279 --> 26:22.648
Do you need help?

26:23.481 --> 26:24.592
What's wrong?

26:24.616 --> 26:26.494
I can't find a Halloween costume.

26:26.518 --> 26:27.986
Can you help me?

26:28.920 --> 26:32.391
Uh... sure.

26:32.415 --> 26:34.435
Come on. Let's... Let's go look.

26:38.930 --> 26:40.541
Yes, I believe so.

26:40.565 --> 26:42.510
Ah! Just the person I was looking for.

26:42.534 --> 26:43.744
Can it wait? I got to do a post-op check.

26:43.768 --> 26:45.246
Oh, I was talking to DeLuca,

26:45.270 --> 26:46.814
but thank you for letting me
know that you're busy.

26:46.838 --> 26:49.683
Ah. Meet me in Mary Rose's room
when you're done.

26:49.707 --> 26:52.386
- Mm-hmm.
- What's up?

26:52.410 --> 26:53.554
So, I just picked up the kids
from school.

26:53.578 --> 26:56.891
Bailey and Ellis are in daycare,
but Zola is refusing.

26:56.915 --> 26:59.527
Because it's for little kids.

26:59.551 --> 27:01.529
I would take her, but I have
surgery, and Amelia's out.

27:01.553 --> 27:03.330
- This isn't really a good time.
- She's super easy.

27:03.354 --> 27:05.399
She'll probably just read her
book or go to the OR gallery.

27:05.423 --> 27:06.534
I-I'm rounding, Maggie...

27:06.558 --> 27:08.492
When's Mom coming back?

27:10.070 --> 27:11.960
Okay. She can, uh...

27:11.984 --> 27:13.173
She can come with me.

27:13.197 --> 27:14.723
- I'll figure something out.
- Great.

27:14.747 --> 27:16.510
So, you're gonna hang out
with Dr. DeLuca,

27:16.534 --> 27:18.479
and I'm gonna come
and get you later, okay?

27:18.503 --> 27:19.536
Mwah.

27:20.505 --> 27:21.738
Bye.

27:24.042 --> 27:25.519
Hey.

27:30.272 --> 27:34.152
Dr. Hurdle, pick up Line 2.
Dr. Hurdle, Line 2.

27:36.073 --> 27:37.918
Am I okay?

27:37.942 --> 27:39.185
Did I miss Halloween?

27:39.209 --> 27:40.954
Your arms are fine.

27:40.978 --> 27:42.656
You're fine,
and you didn't miss anything.

27:42.680 --> 27:44.057
Trick-or-treating didn't even start yet.

27:44.081 --> 27:46.026
Your parents are down in the cafeteria,

27:46.050 --> 27:49.095
in case there's anything
you'd like to tell me

27:49.119 --> 27:50.163
about what really happened.

27:50.187 --> 27:51.998
I don't know.

27:52.022 --> 27:53.934
Mary Rose.

27:54.781 --> 27:56.336
I want Dr. Alex.

27:57.034 --> 27:58.572
Okay, fine.

27:58.596 --> 28:00.029
Lemme get him.

28:05.235 --> 28:06.813
Dude, come on.

28:06.837 --> 28:08.037
Tell me what happened.

28:08.739 --> 28:10.951
Mary Rose, come on.
I'm here to help, you know?

28:10.975 --> 28:12.809
Just tell me what happened.

28:18.315 --> 28:20.160
I begged my moms for a cat,

28:20.184 --> 28:23.351
so they finally got me one... Miss Velma.

28:25.556 --> 28:28.815
But she ran out a few days ago.

28:29.660 --> 28:31.667
I was scared she'd get hit by a car.

28:31.691 --> 28:33.940
So you ran after her, didn't you?

28:33.964 --> 28:35.241
I put on my helmet.

28:35.864 --> 28:38.812
But I didn't have time for my jacket.

28:38.836 --> 28:40.814
Please don't tell my moms.

28:40.838 --> 28:42.484
They'll make me get rid of Miss Velma.

28:42.508 --> 28:44.317
- These burns are very serious...
- And they hurt.

28:44.341 --> 28:46.086
I swear I'm never going out

28:46.110 --> 28:47.954
without my protective gear again.

28:47.978 --> 28:50.056
This sucks.

28:50.080 --> 28:53.326
I'll file this under
doctor-patient privilege this time.

28:53.350 --> 28:55.795
This is your one pass, okay?

29:02.159 --> 29:03.670
See? There's always a reason.

29:03.694 --> 29:05.739
It's just a matter of figuring out a way

29:05.763 --> 29:07.774
to get it out of them.

29:12.036 --> 29:14.180
Superman? It's got a cool cape.

29:14.204 --> 29:15.821
Batman, then?

29:17.508 --> 29:20.020
Okay, uh, uh, Captain America?

29:20.044 --> 29:21.054
Spidey?

29:21.078 --> 29:22.689
No superheroes.

29:23.578 --> 29:24.924
Okay.

29:24.948 --> 29:26.292
Uh, pbht.

29:26.316 --> 29:28.875
Ooh! How about a robot?

29:31.155 --> 29:35.201
Okay, you don't want to be
a monster, an athlete,

29:35.225 --> 29:38.505
a vampire, a racecar driver, a Pokémon,

29:38.529 --> 29:40.106
a superhero, or a robot.

29:40.130 --> 29:42.432
I don't know what else there is.

29:43.600 --> 29:45.568
I want to be a sunflower.

29:50.533 --> 29:52.134
Okay.

29:54.611 --> 29:56.153
So...

29:58.015 --> 30:00.994
maybe two weddings next year?

30:01.018 --> 30:04.264
Uh, we're just focused on the baby.

30:04.288 --> 30:05.899
Who we're gonna raise together,
of course.

30:05.923 --> 30:07.634
You're gonna make a great dad.

30:07.658 --> 30:10.070
Well we obviously have
a lot to figure out

30:10.094 --> 30:12.195
before the baby arrives in the spring.

30:13.378 --> 30:15.842
Exactly when are you due?

30:15.866 --> 30:19.546
Oh, we put a deposit on a wedding venue.

30:19.570 --> 30:21.247
Uh, third weekend in April.

30:24.775 --> 30:25.719
But we're flexible.

30:25.743 --> 30:27.844
We'll forfeit. Yeah.

30:29.546 --> 30:31.291
How old are your kids?

30:31.315 --> 30:32.358
6 and 8.

30:32.382 --> 30:33.518
Those are good ages...

30:33.549 --> 30:34.894
old enough to help

30:34.918 --> 30:36.529
and still young enough to want to.

30:37.277 --> 30:38.565
I just hope they're okay.

30:38.589 --> 30:41.568
Yeah. I mean, how are you
not climbing the walls?

30:41.592 --> 30:43.002
There's nothing else to do in here

30:43.026 --> 30:44.671
but think about how screwed up
everything is.

30:44.695 --> 30:46.539
It's infuriating.

30:46.563 --> 30:48.842
Oh, I was angry.

30:48.866 --> 30:50.243
First few days I was in here,

30:50.267 --> 30:53.546
I almost put a hole
in that wall with my fist.

30:53.570 --> 30:56.583
Then I figured I can go insane with rage

30:56.607 --> 30:59.119
or I can find other things to do.

30:59.143 --> 31:01.354
So I started reading
all of Toni Morrison's books.

31:01.378 --> 31:03.123
I have an ongoing game of gin rummy

31:03.147 --> 31:04.646
with Luiza from D Block.

31:05.017 --> 31:06.595
And I have this puzzle.

31:09.052 --> 31:10.563
Grey, your paperwork's here.

31:12.514 --> 31:14.215
What are you waiting for?

31:15.292 --> 31:16.803
Sorry I'm not gonna help you finish.

31:16.827 --> 31:19.105
We finished the edges.

31:19.129 --> 31:20.377
You just got to work with what you got.

31:22.298 --> 31:23.594
Good luck with your hearing.

31:23.618 --> 31:25.245
- ♪ How I felt, how you stayed
- Good luck with your license.

31:32.309 --> 31:33.820
♪ I remember

31:34.709 --> 31:36.289
Zola?

31:37.347 --> 31:38.381
Zola?

31:38.405 --> 31:40.193
Just me.

31:44.822 --> 31:46.299
There you are.

31:47.257 --> 31:48.802
Want to go check out
the trick-or-treating?

31:48.826 --> 31:49.803
There's some candy.

31:49.827 --> 31:51.271
I'll wait for my mom.

31:53.330 --> 31:55.241
Can we talk, Zola?

31:58.035 --> 32:01.181
Look, I'd really
like for us to get along.

32:01.205 --> 32:03.650
So, did I do something
to upset you this morning

32:03.674 --> 32:05.785
when I was helping you with your costume?

32:05.809 --> 32:09.995
My dad fixed my wings... before he died.

32:10.414 --> 32:11.758
Oh.

32:11.782 --> 32:14.394
They ripped, and he sewed them up.

32:14.418 --> 32:16.663
So you don't like it
when other people touch them?

32:18.188 --> 32:19.833
I don't want to forget him.

32:19.857 --> 32:22.502
Oh, Zola.

32:22.526 --> 32:25.205
You're not gonna forget your dad.

32:25.229 --> 32:26.573
No one's forgetting your dad.

32:26.597 --> 32:27.874
I mean, he was a legend.

32:27.898 --> 32:30.109
Did you know him?

32:30.133 --> 32:31.377
No, I didn't know him.

32:31.401 --> 32:32.979
But a lot of people here did.

32:33.003 --> 32:34.714
And they talk about him all the time.

32:34.738 --> 32:36.182
I've heard the stories so often,

32:36.206 --> 32:38.551
sometimes I forget I wasn't even there.

32:46.383 --> 32:48.027
You know, one time,

32:48.051 --> 32:50.663
there was this lab tech named Isaac,

32:50.687 --> 32:53.733
and he had this huge tumor in his spine.

32:53.757 --> 32:55.368
And he'd taken it to all these doctors,

32:55.392 --> 32:57.370
and they were all too afraid to operate,

32:57.394 --> 32:58.571
but not your dad.

32:58.595 --> 33:00.573
Your dad said he would try.

33:00.597 --> 33:02.342
And when he opened Isaac up,

33:02.366 --> 33:04.043
he saw that the tumor was even bigger

33:04.067 --> 33:05.345
than it was on the scans.

33:05.369 --> 33:07.313
All he could do was stare at it

33:07.337 --> 33:08.681
for 10 hours straight.

33:08.705 --> 33:09.782
Did he take it out?

33:09.806 --> 33:11.150
Not that day.

33:11.174 --> 33:13.453
He stayed up all night thinking about it.

33:13.477 --> 33:15.588
And the next day,
he opened up Isaac again.

33:15.612 --> 33:18.191
He cut out as much of the tumor
as he possibly could...

33:18.215 --> 33:19.659
...until all...

33:21.919 --> 33:24.030
A burial ground explains a lot...

33:24.054 --> 33:25.344
patients crashing,

33:25.368 --> 33:27.533
the stairwell light
that flickers at midnight,

33:27.557 --> 33:29.636
the corpse bride who haunts the room

33:29.660 --> 33:31.371
where her husband died.

33:31.395 --> 33:32.906
Do you have any more gauze?

33:32.930 --> 33:35.875
Oh, my God! Haunted!

33:35.899 --> 33:38.378
Look, nothing is haunted.

33:38.402 --> 33:39.779
The corpse bride is my...

33:39.803 --> 33:41.781
my wife in a Halloween costume.

33:41.805 --> 33:43.149
Okay? The patients crashed

33:43.173 --> 33:44.717
because the refrigerator's broken.

33:44.741 --> 33:46.386
And, yes, there's a burial ground

33:46.410 --> 33:47.987
where the new wing is going,

33:48.011 --> 33:49.722
but we've notified the authorities,

33:49.746 --> 33:51.257
and we're exhuming the bodies.

33:51.281 --> 33:53.326
- Everything is getting back on track.
- Mm-hmm.

33:53.350 --> 33:54.394
So stop spreading rumors.

33:54.418 --> 33:55.895
Get back to work!

33:59.723 --> 34:01.757
Did you say "burial ground"?

34:02.426 --> 34:03.483
Uh...

34:06.296 --> 34:08.408
Almost had 'em.

34:14.994 --> 34:16.774
Keep fighting the good fight, Dr. Grey.

34:16.808 --> 34:17.717
Yeah. Thanks.

34:17.742 --> 34:19.320
But not so hard that
you end up back here.

34:21.746 --> 34:25.125
Um, I don't want to get
either one of us in trouble,

34:25.149 --> 34:27.995
but I do have a small favor to ask.

34:30.621 --> 34:32.498
Dr. Axford to the ER.
Dr. James Axford to the ER.

34:32.523 --> 34:34.868
Austin is okay,

34:34.891 --> 34:36.971
but his head was seriously injured...

34:36.995 --> 34:39.072
same with his pancreas,
which we had to remove.

34:39.097 --> 34:42.141
He's in the ICU, but he's doing fine now.

34:42.166 --> 34:44.411
Oh. Thank God.

34:44.435 --> 34:46.179
Thank you. Thank you so much.

34:46.204 --> 34:47.481
Can I see him?

34:47.505 --> 34:49.940
- Me too.
- Yeah. I can take you now.

34:50.875 --> 34:52.953
Can I take pictures to send
into the costume contest?

34:52.976 --> 34:54.244
Maybe he could still win.

34:55.079 --> 34:59.059
Halloween really brings out the weirdos.

34:59.083 --> 35:00.961
Okay, all you've done today
is complain...

35:00.985 --> 35:02.730
the candy, the costumes.

35:02.754 --> 35:05.299
Catherine Fox may have made you
chief of chiefs,

35:05.323 --> 35:08.006
but she did not make you
the Halloween Grinch!

35:10.728 --> 35:11.972
Yeah. You're right.

35:11.996 --> 35:13.430
I'm sorry.

35:15.500 --> 35:17.211
That's it?

35:17.235 --> 35:19.713
No cynical argument?

35:19.737 --> 35:22.016
No snarky comeback?

35:22.040 --> 35:24.952
Yeah. I used to like Halloween.

35:24.976 --> 35:27.654
But my son David... uh, he loved it.

35:27.678 --> 35:30.324
His mom didn't, so every year,
he and I'd put together his costume

35:30.348 --> 35:32.326
and go trick-or-treating.
It was our thing.

35:32.350 --> 35:33.884
One year, he was, um...

35:36.220 --> 35:39.066
...he was really excited
about being Luke Skywalker.

35:39.090 --> 35:42.102
So, we were making
a stormtrooper, uh, belt,

35:42.126 --> 35:44.038
you know, like he wore in the, um...

35:44.062 --> 35:46.907
when he got out of the trash compactor.
"Episode IV."

35:46.931 --> 35:48.375
Yeah. It was a good costume.

35:48.399 --> 35:49.797
It was.

35:51.002 --> 35:52.513
Except he never got a chance to wear it.

35:52.537 --> 35:54.615
He died two weeks before Halloween,

35:54.639 --> 35:55.887
and I just...

35:56.774 --> 35:58.352
That unworn costume

35:58.376 --> 36:00.054
hung on the back of his door for months.

36:00.078 --> 36:01.768
I couldn't bring myself to...

36:02.947 --> 36:04.358
take it down and...

36:18.763 --> 36:20.040
Oh.

36:21.165 --> 36:23.744
Oh, uh... hey, hey, hey.

36:23.768 --> 36:25.278
Hey, take it, take it, take it, take it.

36:25.302 --> 36:27.247
- Ohh!
- What? What?

36:27.271 --> 36:29.249
- That's okay.
- No, no. No, no. Shh.

36:30.408 --> 36:33.554
It's okay. Come on.

36:33.578 --> 36:35.345
Easy, easy.

36:40.151 --> 36:41.361
Let's get out of here.

36:41.385 --> 36:43.202
Today was a... a nightmare.

36:43.226 --> 36:44.769
Hey.

36:45.189 --> 36:47.101
You are amazing.

36:47.125 --> 36:49.470
You are turning a house of
horrors into a legit hospital,

36:49.494 --> 36:52.139
and I am sorry if those
investors can't see that.

36:52.163 --> 36:53.259
Well, don't be.

36:53.290 --> 36:54.975
I'm getting a new research facility.

36:54.999 --> 36:56.143
They gave you the funding?

36:56.167 --> 36:57.611
Yeah, they said they were impressed

36:57.635 --> 36:59.313
with my ability to handle chaos.

36:59.337 --> 37:00.514
They don't even know the half of it.

37:00.538 --> 37:02.105
They should visit your childhood.

37:03.640 --> 37:05.885
Hey, you know what?

37:05.910 --> 37:08.322
- Yeah?
- We should do something to celebrate.

37:08.446 --> 37:11.959
Great. I am absolutely dressed for that.

37:13.584 --> 37:14.864
What?

37:14.888 --> 37:16.694
What time does the courthouse close?

37:21.859 --> 37:25.105
Sometimes your worst
nightmare comes true,

37:25.129 --> 37:27.522
but you find it's really
nothing to worry about.

37:32.170 --> 37:35.516
Happy cancer-versary!

37:42.246 --> 37:43.524
Shh.

37:45.550 --> 37:47.194
Trick or treat!

37:47.218 --> 37:49.496
Mom!

37:49.520 --> 37:51.465
Hey! Mommy, Mommy!

37:51.489 --> 37:52.752
I missed you!

37:52.776 --> 37:53.734
Hi!

37:53.758 --> 37:55.903
Hi!

37:57.161 --> 37:59.006
Cool costume, Mom.

37:59.030 --> 38:01.241
- Thanks.
- We're sorting candy. Wanna help?

38:01.265 --> 38:02.643
I do. I'll be there in one minute, okay?

38:02.667 --> 38:04.311
Okay, let's give your mom a minute.

38:04.335 --> 38:06.146
Come on. Welcome home, jailbird.

38:06.170 --> 38:07.481
Thanks.

38:07.505 --> 38:09.183
I'm so glad you're back.

38:09.207 --> 38:10.150
- Ohh.
- How was it?

38:10.174 --> 38:11.485
It was horrible.

38:11.509 --> 38:13.220
That was always my experience.

38:16.113 --> 38:18.125
But, you know,
I had a lot of time to think,

38:18.149 --> 38:20.827
and I realized that, okay,
so, if I don't have a job

38:20.851 --> 38:22.262
and I can't practice medicine,

38:22.286 --> 38:25.165
I still have a lot to work with.

38:25.189 --> 38:26.934
And I'll figure something out.

38:28.359 --> 38:29.870
You're not gonna help us sort candy?

38:29.894 --> 38:31.405
No, I am.

38:31.429 --> 38:33.106
I just... I have to call my lawyer.

38:33.130 --> 38:34.908
I-I need help with a puzzle.

38:34.932 --> 38:36.348
Occasionally you discover

38:36.372 --> 38:39.680
that what you most dread
is really a blessing.

38:42.240 --> 38:45.219
And your life is better
because you persevered,

38:45.243 --> 38:47.120
despite your fears.

38:50.414 --> 38:52.226
Hey. Where's your costume?

38:52.250 --> 38:54.127
This is it... kick-ass surgeon!

38:54.151 --> 38:55.320
- I love it.
- Okay, look,

38:55.344 --> 38:57.264
I didn't have time to make
Leo and Allison costumes

38:57.288 --> 38:58.799
and I am not gonna sew costumes

38:58.823 --> 39:00.200
and I am not gonna be classroom mom

39:00.224 --> 39:02.301
or do all the other things
that your mom did.

39:02.325 --> 39:04.738
Yeah. I know.
That's why I brought these old costumes

39:04.762 --> 39:07.241
to see if they might fit these guys.

39:09.734 --> 39:10.876
Oh.

39:10.900 --> 39:13.614
Wait. You thought I wanted you
to sew costumes?

39:14.919 --> 39:17.084
- I...
- So you thought I made this special trip

39:17.108 --> 39:19.319
just to hand you my mom's old costumes

39:19.343 --> 39:21.526
with the sole purpose of shaming you?

39:21.926 --> 39:23.906
Or, like, inspiring me?

39:24.982 --> 39:27.294
I was inspired, if that helps at all.

39:27.318 --> 39:30.264
What are they supposed to be?

39:30.666 --> 39:31.765
Zombies?

39:31.789 --> 39:33.900
You dressed our babies up as dead babies?

39:33.924 --> 39:35.969
Well, that's a terrible way to put it.

39:35.993 --> 39:37.037
Oh, hey.

39:37.061 --> 39:38.605
We're just about to kick off
the costume parade.

39:38.629 --> 39:41.341
Are these little guys gonna...
Oh, my... Ahh.

39:44.135 --> 39:47.414
Next year, you might
want to just buy costumes.

39:47.438 --> 39:50.150
But sometimes your worst
nightmare is truly scary.

39:51.575 --> 39:54.154
And it feels like
it's never going to end.

39:55.813 --> 39:58.191
That's when support from
friends and family is vital.

40:01.319 --> 40:04.164
Hey. There he is.

40:04.188 --> 40:06.266
Oh! Aww.

40:06.290 --> 40:08.468
What happened to "Dungeons & Dragons"?

40:08.492 --> 40:10.904
I felt more like a sunflower today.

40:15.166 --> 40:16.176
- Boo!
- Ah!

40:16.200 --> 40:17.377
Aah! What are you doing here?

40:17.401 --> 40:18.779
I couldn't wait any longer to see you.

40:18.803 --> 40:20.881
Okay. Here. Get in. Get in. Get in.

40:20.905 --> 40:22.416
♪ How you like me now?

40:22.440 --> 40:24.284
Aww, aww, aww.

40:24.308 --> 40:25.819
And I'm posting it

40:25.843 --> 40:27.287
because joy should be shared.

40:28.474 --> 40:30.966
Vampire and sunflower...
that's some serious kink.

40:30.990 --> 40:32.659
You want to surround yourself with people

40:32.683 --> 40:34.661
who will wake you up
from your nightmare...

40:34.685 --> 40:37.397
"For better or worse..."

40:37.421 --> 40:39.266
For better or worse...

40:39.290 --> 40:40.551
"...for richer or poorer..."

40:40.575 --> 40:42.936
...for richer or pregnant.

40:45.110 --> 40:46.220
What?

40:46.244 --> 40:47.507
I'm pregnant.

40:49.700 --> 40:51.945
Scared you!

40:53.337 --> 40:54.481
I got you so good.

40:54.505 --> 40:56.283
- Wait. You're not pregnant?
- No.

40:56.307 --> 40:58.218
Oh, my God, you should've seen your face.

41:00.378 --> 41:02.001
Sorry. I'm sorry.

41:03.347 --> 41:05.859
For richer or poorer...

41:05.883 --> 41:07.561
"...in sickness and in health..."

41:07.585 --> 41:08.895
...in sickness and in health...

41:08.919 --> 41:12.165
...and help you live your wildest dreams.

41:18.396 --> 41:20.674
Your bail's been posted. Time to go.

41:21.832 --> 41:23.643
What? By who?

41:23.667 --> 41:25.435
Doesn't say.

41:26.936 --> 41:28.678
You coming or what?

41:29.305 --> 41:35.797
