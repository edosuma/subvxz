That's right, I do.

00:10.097 --> 00:12.621
I hope you're not planning on
making a big deal out of it.

Nope. I'm just gonna stick
with the step-by-step

00:16.625 --> 00:19.280
Well! Don't think
of it as a manual.

Just, you know,
little hints.

down the right path.

00:36.949 --> 00:40.649
If it happens, that
would be lovely.

00:40.736 --> 00:42.955
If it does,
a...little bouquet

00:43.043 --> 00:46.002
of fresh flowers would
make it extra special.

00:46.089 --> 00:48.309
- Flowers.
- Your choice.

00:48.396 --> 00:52.400
- Tulips.
- Gerber daisies.

Color is totally
your call.

- In yellow.

01:01.365 --> 01:03.715
- I choose yellow.
- Ah!

Shall I continue?

Yes, I'm dying to

we're going to the museum"

"Dinosaurs."

and that's where they keep 'em.

Now, for lunch, I'm thinking
falafel. How far off am I?

01:35.704 --> 01:37.706
You know what, I should've
been more specific.

up against falafel.

Hey, you don't have any
Gerber daisies, do you?

02:07.214 --> 02:09.651
Tom's place is being tented
and bombed for termites.

02:09.738 --> 02:12.001
So he's gonna crash here
for a couple of days.

02:12.088 --> 02:14.351
- You mean, in the house?
- Hey, listen.

02:14.438 --> 02:16.005
Not to harsh your mellow,
but if I had

02:16.092 --> 02:18.529
a police dog here, would
he be barking at your bag?

been trained

10:06.431 --> 10:08.477
throwing it on you, and then
tossing you in the back

10:08.564 --> 10:10.958
of a panel van.

10:11.045 --> 10:14.004
Hey, who wants
homemade gelato?

10:14.091 --> 10:15.571
'I do.'

10:17.747 --> 10:19.793
Molly, what don't
you like Tom?

10:19.880 --> 10:21.577
I just think
he's a bad influence.

10:21.664 --> 10:24.058
And I don't want you to end up
living in some compound

10:24.145 --> 10:27.191
washing his feet
with your hair.

10:27.278 --> 10:30.325
It would appear that someone
got a head start on the gelato.

10:30.412 --> 10:32.588
Uh, it's cool.

10:32.675 --> 10:34.503
They just need to know
that they're gonna be high

10:34.590 --> 10:37.375
for about five days.

10:37.462 --> 10:39.421
What do you mean high?

10:39.508 --> 10:41.205
Hi!

10:49.823 --> 10:51.825
We have any
more gelato?

10:51.912 --> 10:55.611
Not for you we don't.

10:55.698 --> 10:57.265
You happy? My husband,
the police officer

10:57.352 --> 10:58.875
is now stoned out
of his gourd.

10:58.962 --> 11:00.181
If you're worried they're
gonna check his urine

11:00.268 --> 11:01.835
Tom can get
you clean pee.

11:01.922 --> 11:04.576
Absolutely, and the first
jar is free.

11:04.664 --> 11:05.882
I'm gonna hit him.
I'm gonna punch him--

11:05.969 --> 11:07.318
No, Tom take care
of this.

11:07.405 --> 11:09.756
I'm on it. I'll
navigate his flight.

11:09.843 --> 11:11.845
Hey, big buddy,
how's about you and I

11:11.932 --> 11:14.543
go for a nice walk
in the fresh air?

11:14.630 --> 11:17.459
Okay, and I'll be right
here, when you get back.

11:20.854 --> 11:22.507
Are you happy,
you turned my husband

11:22.594 --> 11:24.031
the cop, into a dope fiend?

11:24.118 --> 11:26.337
Don't worry, Tom is
a total expert

11:26.424 --> 11:29.166
at guiding people down
from a total freak out.

11:29.253 --> 11:31.038
- He got away.
- What?

[violin playing nearby]

12:22.785 --> 12:24.700
[screams]

12:28.269 --> 12:30.837
My God, do you realize that Mike
could lose his job over this?

12:30.924 --> 12:32.839
Don't blame me, he was
the one that ate

12:32.926 --> 12:34.405
all the ice cream without
asking what's in it.

12:34.492 --> 12:36.538
That's what he does,
he once drank a whole pan

12:36.625 --> 12:39.193
of hot dog water,
thinking it was soup.

12:39.280 --> 12:41.369
Okay, then it's my fault
then, just blame me.

12:41.456 --> 12:42.457
You blame me
for everything.

12:42.544 --> 12:44.285
Victoria, you are
32 years old.

12:44.372 --> 12:46.200
You can't keep living
your life like a teenager.

12:46.287 --> 12:47.723
What is wrong with
having a good time?

12:47.810 --> 12:49.507
I am not hurting anybody.

12:49.594 --> 12:52.641
My husband is stoned
and running amuck.

12:54.817 --> 12:56.384
Oh, you never make
mistakes, do you?

12:56.471 --> 12:58.821
Little Miss Perfect.
Molly gets good grades.

12:58.908 --> 13:00.257
Molly only dates single men.

13:00.344 --> 13:02.303
Molly doesn't wake up
under bridges.

13:02.390 --> 13:04.131
Slow down, slow down.
Is that him?

13:04.218 --> 13:06.698
- No, big stack of tires.
- Keep driving.

13:06.786 --> 13:07.917
Boy, you put a head
on those things.

13:08.004 --> 13:08.962
That could be his
twin brother.

13:09.049 --> 13:11.051
Help me find my husband!

13:11.138 --> 13:13.923
Don't yell at me!

Oh!

13:40.210 --> 13:42.996
- Hey, how are you?
- You cold?

13:43.083 --> 13:44.824
- It's pretty cold, buddy.
- Yeah!

13:44.911 --> 13:46.173
Warm?

13:46.260 --> 13:47.827

You uptown now.

Oh, if only I were.

14:13.896 --> 14:15.680
Oh, good, Mike's here.

14:15.767 --> 14:20.294
We're playing Monopoly. You're
the shoe, and I'm out of jail.

14:20.381 --> 14:21.643
Come on in, man.

14:21.730 --> 14:24.602
- You want some chili?
- Chili!

14:24.689 --> 14:25.865
Good, you brought
your appetite.

14:25.952 --> 14:27.431
Relax, make yourself
comfortable.

14:27.518 --> 14:28.563
- Thirsty!
- Well.

14:28.650 --> 14:30.478
Let me grab
you a beverage.

14:30.565 --> 14:32.697
- I got beer. I got soda pop.
- I could make you a milkshake.

14:32.784 --> 14:36.963
- Mm, milkshake good!
- Comin' up.

14:37.050 --> 14:38.573
I DVR'd the fight
so you can watch it

14:38.660 --> 14:40.314
three or four times,
while I make your malted.

14:40.401 --> 14:42.969
Mmm, M&M'S.

14:43.056 --> 14:44.448
Melt in your mouth,
not in your hand.

14:44.535 --> 14:45.841
Just don't fill up
on those 'cause I gotta

14:45.928 --> 14:47.364
tub of chili with
your name on it.

14:47.451 --> 14:49.105
Mike!

14:51.760 --> 14:53.588
That's right!

14:56.983 --> 14:59.811
What are we gonna do now?
We can't call the police.

14:59.899 --> 15:02.205
He's not picking
up his phone.

15:02.292 --> 15:04.077
We could put flyers
up with his picture

15:04.164 --> 15:07.297
on it that says he
answers to "Mike."

15:07.384 --> 15:11.127
I know I said there was no bad
ideas, but that's a bad idea.

15:11.214 --> 15:12.476
I'm sorry.

15:12.563 --> 15:14.478
I'm just trying to help.

15:14.565 --> 15:17.351
I think some of this
could be my fault.

15:18.830 --> 15:21.485
Some of it?
How about all of it?

15:21.572 --> 15:23.966
You're right.

15:24.053 --> 15:27.013
I'm just a big,
stupid pothead.

15:27.100 --> 15:29.058
With less sense
than a squirrel.

15:30.886 --> 15:32.279
I..

15:32.366 --> 15:34.890
...I didn't say
you were stupid.

15:34.977 --> 15:38.285
And I certainly didn't
say "Squirrel stupid."

15:38.372 --> 15:41.114
I just, I wish you
made better choices.

15:41.201 --> 15:44.465
Probably should've just
stayed at junior college.

15:44.552 --> 15:47.033
But when a Backstreet Boy
lures you on the tour bus

15:47.120 --> 15:50.819
you don't worry that
it's final's week.

15:50.906 --> 15:54.649
Well, maybe you do.

15:54.736 --> 15:57.608
That's bong water
under the bridge.

15:57.695 --> 15:59.349
You know, you could
still go back.

15:59.436 --> 16:01.090
You mean go
back to school?

16:01.177 --> 16:02.613
Why not?

16:02.700 --> 16:05.138
You'd be a good student
if you applied yourself.

16:05.225 --> 16:08.097
I'm sure you've saved up
a little bit of money.

16:08.184 --> 16:09.881
Thirty six thousand
dollars.

16:09.969 --> 16:13.798
What?

16:13.885 --> 16:16.236
Moll, I don't pay rent.

16:16.323 --> 16:17.889
And I haven't had to
buy a meal or a drink

16:17.977 --> 16:20.022
since my boobs
came in.

16:21.328 --> 16:25.593
Wow!

16:25.680 --> 16:27.899
Can I borrow $8,000?

16:30.728 --> 16:31.991
We should probably keep
looking for Mike.

16:32.078 --> 16:33.514
Okay.

16:39.520 --> 16:40.825
[groans]

16:42.349 --> 16:44.568
Alright, that's the
last of the chili.

16:44.655 --> 16:46.005
But don't worry,
I'm whipping up some

16:46.092 --> 16:47.528
of my famous silver
dollar pancakes.

16:47.615 --> 16:49.573

16:50.922 --> 16:52.054
Man, your phone's
ringing again.

16:52.141 --> 16:54.883
It might be important.

16:54.970 --> 16:56.624

Carl speaking.

16:56.711 --> 16:58.321
Oh, hey, Molly!

16:58.408 --> 17:00.193
Yeah, he's right here.

17:00.280 --> 17:01.585
No, he's fine.
We're just hanging out.

new apartment.

No, I don't
think so.

17:11.987 --> 17:13.467
No, it seems like
the same ol' Mike.

17:13.554 --> 17:16.600
- Pancakes!
- Yup, same ol', same ol'.

slept through page one

17:49.198 --> 17:51.026
Well, that was actually
more for Mike.

a history class and if I wait

much longer, there's gonna
be a lot more to learn.
