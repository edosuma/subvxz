Let's start with discussing
the origin of differences

11:53.133 --> 11:54.433
between men and women--

11:54.433 --> 11:56.333
You're right across the hall
from Carly Ward,

11:56.333 --> 11:57.333
Deb's daughter.

11:57.333 --> 11:59.000
Ain't she a fox?

11:59.000 --> 12:01.033
Many social influences
play a role

12:01.033 --> 12:02.566
in determining
these differences.

12:02.566 --> 12:04.133
If you ever hear the kids
talking about someone

12:04.133 --> 12:06.266
named Miss First,
you'd best tell me about it.

12:06.266 --> 12:08.100
Is that, like,
another teacher?

12:08.100 --> 12:09.300
No one knows who it is.

12:09.300 --> 12:12.000
They say Miss First
turns boys into men.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.600
For their sake,
God, I hope it's her.

12:14.600 --> 12:17.400
Um, this is
the longest tour ever.

12:17.400 --> 12:19.533
And this is the grand finale.

12:24.566 --> 12:26.133
Dang.

12:26.133 --> 12:27.100
Mm.

12:27.100 --> 12:29.000
[bell ringing]

12:35.600 --> 12:37.066
Thank you!

12:37.066 --> 12:38.300
Thank you.

12:38.300 --> 12:39.666
Good morning, sir.
I'm Keely.

12:39.666 --> 12:40.766
And I'm Amber.

12:40.766 --> 12:42.233
Good morning!
Hi, ladies!

12:42.233 --> 12:43.533
We brought you
a little something.

12:43.533 --> 12:46.033
We just wanted to say,
Welcome to Milford High.

12:46.033 --> 12:47.766
Aw, thank you.

12:47.766 --> 12:48.633
Chocolates!

12:48.633 --> 12:50.500
I love chocolates!

12:50.500 --> 12:51.366
Have some.

12:51.366 --> 12:52.400
Sure.

12:52.400 --> 12:54.266
Amber's mom makes it fresh.

12:54.266 --> 12:55.166
Oh, please.

12:55.166 --> 12:57.066
Tell your mom I said thank you.

12:57.066 --> 12:58.466
Oh, I will.

12:58.466 --> 13:01.033
Now you ladies get to your
seat before I eat the whole box.

13:01.033 --> 13:01.733
[chuckles]

13:01.733 --> 13:03.300
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

13:04.500 --> 13:05.766
Ladies!

13:05.766 --> 13:09.100
Today is not the day
to show off your ignorance.

13:09.733 --> 13:11.533
Get it together!

13:15.033 --> 13:16.300
Hi!

13:16.300 --> 13:18.266
I'm Mr. Martinez,
and I just want to let you know

13:18.266 --> 13:21.066
how excited I am to be here.

13:21.066 --> 13:22.200
[laughing]

13:22.200 --> 13:23.233
Okay!

13:23.233 --> 13:24.500
Don't worry.

13:24.500 --> 13:26.466
I used to think the same things
were just as funny

13:26.466 --> 13:28.066
when I was your age.

13:28.066 --> 13:29.266
[laughing]

13:29.266 --> 13:32.366
Okay, okay! Let's
just get it all out of...

13:32.366 --> 13:35.000
[coughing]
...our systems now.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.600
[laughing]

13:36.600 --> 13:39.266
Three...two...one.

13:39.266 --> 13:40.500
[clearing throat]

13:40.500 --> 13:42.500
You know...
[belches]

13:42.500 --> 13:43.500
Pardon me.

13:43.500 --> 13:45.233
[laughing]
Lift off!

13:45.500 --> 13:46.766
(RICHARD)  You know what, kids?

13:46.766 --> 13:48.766
I'm not-- I'm not feeling
so good all of a sudden.

13:48.766 --> 13:50.666
If you can just give
me a minute, I'll be--

13:50.666 --> 13:52.466
I'll be right back.

13:55.533 --> 13:58.066
Keely, can I put you
in charge for two minutes,

13:58.066 --> 14:00.133
just two minutes top--

14:00.133 --> 14:02.200
[laughing]

14:03.433 --> 14:05.300
Okay, guys, quick.
Grab the chemistry set.

14:10.366 --> 14:11.566
Best behaviour, baby.

14:11.566 --> 14:13.033
She's here now.

14:13.700 --> 14:15.566
So nice to see you,
Superintendent.

14:15.566 --> 14:18.733
So nice to see you again too.

14:18.733 --> 14:20.266
[rumbling]

14:20.266 --> 14:21.633
[explosion]

14:21.633 --> 14:23.433
What the devil?

14:23.433 --> 14:25.233
You, uh, wanted to see me?

14:25.233 --> 14:27.333
Where to start?

14:28.000 --> 14:29.133
Where to start?

14:29.133 --> 14:30.300
[beep]
Uh, you could start

14:30.300 --> 14:32.500
with why Richard
left his class alone.

14:32.500 --> 14:35.033
-Hmm?
-Is she listening in?

14:35.033 --> 14:36.333
Yes.

14:36.333 --> 14:38.033
Richard, there's been a lot
of people come in here

14:38.033 --> 14:39.566
and try out this job.

14:39.566 --> 14:41.666
And none of them
have been as bad as you.

14:43.066 --> 14:45.200
I know these kids are a handful.

14:45.200 --> 14:47.700
There's only one thing keeping
me from sending you back

14:47.700 --> 14:49.466
to the middle of nowhere,
where you come from.

14:49.466 --> 14:50.733
Middle of nowhere?

14:50.733 --> 14:53.000
I...
I taught in New York City.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.400
You taught kindy-garten.

14:55.400 --> 14:57.366
Mr. Martinez,

14:57.366 --> 15:00.600
you come highly recommended
from the Ambassador Program,

15:00.600 --> 15:05.466
so I need you
to help me, help you.

15:05.466 --> 15:09.033
I-I can help these kids
if you give me a chance.

15:09.033 --> 15:11.233
Will I be seeing you
at the football game tonight?

15:11.233 --> 15:15.400
There's your chance to mingle
with the rest of the staff.

15:15.400 --> 15:16.500
[sighing]

15:16.500 --> 15:18.066
I'll be there with
enough school spirit

15:18.066 --> 15:21.066
to fuel a jetliner, sir.

15:21.066 --> 15:22.433
Yeah, we'll see about that.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.600
[cheering]

15:25.600 --> 15:26.733
Come on, Mavericks!

15:26.733 --> 15:29.333
Rip 'em up!
Rip 'em up!

15:31.333 --> 15:33.433
You almost
fumbled it, you pussy!

15:33.433 --> 15:34.600
What's your name?

15:34.600 --> 15:35.766
[mumbling]
Shut up!

15:35.766 --> 15:37.633
I don't care about your name!
Get up!

15:37.633 --> 15:39.000
Get out!

15:39.000 --> 15:41.200
You get on out!

15:41.200 --> 15:42.600
God, you're terrible!

15:42.600 --> 15:44.033
This is intense!

15:44.666 --> 15:47.333
There's something
queer about him.

15:47.333 --> 15:49.500
I can't put my finger on it.

15:49.500 --> 15:51.666
Didn't you say he's
from New York, Mama?

15:51.666 --> 15:54.666
He complimented my purse.

15:54.666 --> 15:56.000
So what are you saying?

15:56.000 --> 15:58.300
He's, like, some kind of queer?

15:58.300 --> 16:01.400
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

16:01.400 --> 16:03.133
You should
go talk to him, honey.

16:03.133 --> 16:04.133
You think?

16:04.133 --> 16:05.033
Yeah.

16:05.033 --> 16:06.600
Show him Minnie and Mickey.

16:06.600 --> 16:07.466
[chuckles]

16:07.466 --> 16:09.533
No man can resist.

16:22.466 --> 16:23.766
Bitch!

16:26.166 --> 16:29.300
Well, aren't you just
hotter than bark on a tree!

16:29.300 --> 16:31.733
Well, hello.
[chuckles]

16:31.733 --> 16:33.566
I'm Carly.

16:33.566 --> 16:35.100
I was upset I didn't get to meet

16:35.100 --> 16:37.333
the cute new member
of our staff today.

16:37.333 --> 16:39.666
Oh, well, that's very nice.

16:39.666 --> 16:41.400
Nice to meet you.

16:41.400 --> 16:44.133
So how do you like Texas so far?

16:44.133 --> 16:47.433
Well, um, everybody
seems to be very welcoming,

16:47.433 --> 16:50.333
to say the least.
[chuckles nervously]

16:50.333 --> 16:51.300
[chuckles]
We're gonna have to spend

16:51.300 --> 16:53.066
more time together.

16:53.066 --> 16:56.066
We're going to be real,
great friends. I can tell.

16:57.033 --> 16:58.600
So!

16:58.600 --> 17:00.733
Do you, uh, like
teaching social studies?

17:00.733 --> 17:02.333
Oh, yeah!

17:02.333 --> 17:04.233
Mama thinks I have
a chance at this year's

17:04.233 --> 17:05.433
Teacher of the Year award.

17:05.433 --> 17:07.500
That's out of the whole state.

17:07.500 --> 17:11.333
And this year,
the winner gets 25 grand.

17:11.333 --> 17:13.098
[chuckling]

17:13.098 --> 17:15.200
Well, good luck for you.

17:22.665 --> 17:25.400
So now that we've been
formally introduced,

17:25.400 --> 17:27.598
I'd like to introduce you
to a couple of friends of mine.

17:27.598 --> 17:30.200
Oh, sure.

17:30.200 --> 17:32.000
Mickey and Minnie.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.466
Oh!

17:34.466 --> 17:36.733
Ooh!
[chuckling nervously]

17:36.733 --> 17:37.766
[cow bell ringing]

17:37.766 --> 17:39.066
(Announcer)  Defense!

17:39.066 --> 17:41.500
15 yards on that first down!

17:44.500 --> 17:46.333
I knew it.

17:47.400 --> 17:50.633
Richard, I'm going to make this
quick and painless as possible.

17:50.633 --> 17:52.533
Of course.
What's up?

17:52.533 --> 17:54.200
We're going to
have to let you go.

17:55.200 --> 17:56.266
Excuse me?

17:56.266 --> 17:57.600
He said you're shit-canned.

17:57.600 --> 17:59.433
What-- what is he doing here?

17:59.433 --> 18:00.733
The principal likes
extra security

18:00.733 --> 18:02.433
in situations such as these.

18:02.433 --> 18:07.633
We feel...I feel that your
situation will be a distraction.

18:07.633 --> 18:10.366
Wh--what situation?

18:12.300 --> 18:15.066
Found this on the Internet.

18:15.066 --> 18:16.500
[beep]

18:16.500 --> 18:19.566
Single gay male seeks partner
who enjoys laughter, music,

18:19.566 --> 18:21.266
long-term relationship.

18:21.266 --> 18:23.233
[laughs]

18:23.233 --> 18:24.566
Where did you find that?

18:24.566 --> 18:26.333
I haven't logged
into that for years!

18:26.333 --> 18:28.033
He ain't even going to deny it.

18:28.033 --> 18:29.066
I thought we had a deal.

18:29.066 --> 18:30.466
You need me to step in, sir?

18:32.000 --> 18:34.066
This school has strong values.

18:34.433 --> 18:36.466
Turn-offs include
self-centredness

18:36.466 --> 18:38.200
and bad hygiene.

18:38.200 --> 18:39.433
Oh!

18:39.433 --> 18:41.433
We need to keep
the children safe from those

18:41.433 --> 18:44.666
that participate
in alternative relationships.

18:44.666 --> 18:47.200
You know,
man on man, man on dog.

18:47.200 --> 18:48.400
You understand.

18:48.400 --> 18:50.366
Are you serious?

18:50.366 --> 18:52.566
One more word from you,
and, uh,

18:52.566 --> 18:54.166
I might have to call the law.

18:55.266 --> 18:57.566
See you never, flamesauce!

18:57.566 --> 18:59.233
[laughing]

19:03.166 --> 19:04.700
Richard, Richard, Richard,

19:04.700 --> 19:06.233
there's very little I can do

19:06.233 --> 19:09.100
for a teacher who gets
fired so quick into the job.

19:09.100 --> 19:10.066
I mean, come on!

19:10.066 --> 19:11.500
I'll go to Oklahoma!
Kentucky!

19:11.500 --> 19:12.600
I'll go anywhere.

19:12.600 --> 19:14.066
Richard, darling,

19:14.066 --> 19:16.033
we have a waiting list
of over a hundred people,

19:16.033 --> 19:17.733
and right now,

19:17.733 --> 19:19.233
you're at the bottom
of the pile.

19:19.233 --> 19:21.066
You can't tell me
what they did was legal.

19:21.066 --> 19:23.266
You can't just fire somebody.

19:23.266 --> 19:26.600
It's perfectly legal in many
states, Texas being one of them.

19:26.600 --> 19:31.133
Look, I have to go, but
if you need any other help,

19:33.466 --> 19:36.700
just write a letter
to congress, okay?

19:36.700 --> 19:38.166
God.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.666
Siri, I need a drink.

19:58.500 --> 19:59.433
Hmm?

19:59.433 --> 20:00.500
(Richard)  Hey, hey.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.166
There he is.

20:02.166 --> 20:04.000
How you doin', Boo?

20:04.000 --> 20:06.433
Hey, I wish
you guys were here.

20:06.433 --> 20:07.666
That's nasty.

20:07.666 --> 20:09.166
Ask him if he
downloaded  Grinder  yet.

20:09.166 --> 20:12.333
No, I haven't downloaded
Grinder  yet, you whore.

20:12.333 --> 20:14.200
We just want to know how many
gay cowboys there are

20:14.200 --> 20:15.366
in the Bible Belt.

20:15.366 --> 20:16.666
[chuckles]

20:16.666 --> 20:19.333
Wait, hold on.
I'm going to put you on speaker.

20:19.333 --> 20:21.633
So, you guys are going
to go to  White party  ?

20:21.633 --> 20:22.366
I think it's racist.

20:22.366 --> 20:24.200
He ain't ever invited me
to go to no black party.

20:24.200 --> 20:25.400
She wouldn't think it was racist

20:25.400 --> 20:27.133
if she looked half-decent
in anything here.

20:27.133 --> 20:30.166
-I told you I have body issues.
-Do cardio.

20:30.166 --> 20:31.633
Okay. All right,

20:31.633 --> 20:34.633
according to  Grinder  ,
the closest gay guy is...

20:34.633 --> 20:37.166
drum roll, please!

20:37.166 --> 20:39.533
30 miles away.

20:39.533 --> 20:41.033
30 miles!
Oh, no, bitch.

20:41.033 --> 20:42.333
We've got to get
you up out of there.

20:42.333 --> 20:43.533
This is an emergency.

20:43.533 --> 20:45.766
We're coming to get you, baby.
Where is she?

20:45.766 --> 20:47.100
Huh?

20:47.100 --> 20:48.266
I'm going to grab a drink.

20:48.266 --> 20:49.733
Love you guys.
Mean it.

20:49.733 --> 20:51.166
Oh, bitch,
hurry up and get changed.

20:51.166 --> 20:52.500
We have GPS.

20:52.500 --> 20:53.533
Try red.

20:53.533 --> 20:55.533
Do you have anything on sale?

20:56.666 --> 20:58.033
[horks]

21:01.700 --> 21:03.700
Oh, hello.

21:03.700 --> 21:06.333
Uh, can I have a, uh,
vodka soda, please?

21:08.566 --> 21:09.500
What?

21:09.500 --> 21:10.533
Really?

21:10.533 --> 21:12.566
Dry county.

21:12.566 --> 21:15.533
Wait! There's, like, no booze
in the whole county?

21:15.533 --> 21:18.133

[whispering] So you know
that I grew up as a boy,

32:02.600 --> 32:04.466
but what you don't know is--

32:04.466 --> 32:05.766
Why are you whispering?

32:05.766 --> 32:07.666
We're in your house alone.

32:07.666 --> 32:09.166
[whispering]
But what I didn't tell you

32:09.166 --> 32:11.533
is the experience
that I had growing up.

32:11.533 --> 32:14.200
Okay, you need to stop,
because this is freaking me out.

32:14.200 --> 32:15.466
Okay.

32:15.466 --> 32:17.233
[whispering] So what
I'm trying to say is--

32:17.233 --> 32:18.633
You're doing it again!

32:18.633 --> 32:20.566
This is difficult for me!

32:20.566 --> 32:22.500
You need to calm down!

32:22.500 --> 32:24.033
[both grunt in frustration]

32:24.633 --> 32:29.533
Coach Chuck is my baby brother.

32:32.100 --> 32:34.233
Is it a requirement
in this town

32:34.233 --> 32:36.333
for everyone to be related?

32:36.333 --> 32:38.433
We were close
when I was younger, but...

32:38.433 --> 32:40.466
I ran away after I came out.

32:42.000 --> 32:45.533
You're the only person
I've ever told any of this.

32:45.533 --> 32:47.200
Let me get this straight.

32:47.200 --> 32:51.466
So Miss Cartoon Boobs is related
to Little Debbie Snack Cakes.

32:51.466 --> 32:53.200
You used to be a man.

32:53.200 --> 32:54.600
I'm dealing with
my own identity issues,

32:54.600 --> 32:56.200
and now you're
trying to convince me

32:56.200 --> 32:58.500
that you're related to Little
Black Book and Titty Cake?

32:58.500 --> 33:00.166
So you won't say anything?

33:00.166 --> 33:04.733
Who could I possibly tell that
would believe this shit, Karma?

33:08.433 --> 33:10.433
Is this the front, or the back?

33:10.433 --> 33:12.466
It's a poncho, bitch.

33:18.233 --> 33:20.666
(Over PA)  We'd like to introduce
the newest member

33:20.666 --> 33:22.366
to Milford's teaching staff.

33:22.366 --> 33:24.766
Starting today in the
senior science department,

33:24.766 --> 33:27.200
please welcome Miss Del Rio.

33:30.233 --> 33:31.633
Smear the queer!

33:31.633 --> 33:33.033
Smear the queer!

33:33.033 --> 33:34.500
Yeah!

33:34.500 --> 33:36.133
(shouts indistinctly)

33:36.133 --> 33:37.600
Smear the queer!

33:37.600 --> 33:39.100
Smear the queer!

33:39.100 --> 33:40.433
Smear the queer!

33:40.433 --> 33:43.666
[chanting continues]

33:47.366 --> 33:48.766
[air horn sounds]

33:48.766 --> 33:49.733
Get some of that!

33:49.733 --> 33:51.333
Get--

33:52.366 --> 33:53.733
What the... What...

33:53.733 --> 33:55.233
What on earth?

33:55.233 --> 33:58.033
[air horn continues to blast]

34:08.199 --> 34:09.400
She's not going to last.

34:09.400 --> 34:11.433
She might last longer
than Professor Gaywad.

34:11.433 --> 34:13.100
I give her two days.

34:13.100 --> 34:14.600
I give her two minutes.

34:14.600 --> 34:17.266
Let's start with covalent bonds.

34:17.266 --> 34:19.433
Um, Miss Del Taco?

34:19.433 --> 34:20.366
[laughing]

34:20.366 --> 34:21.533
Call me Miss Bianca.

34:21.533 --> 34:24.100
It's easier
for you to pronounce.

34:24.100 --> 34:26.400
Um, when we have
a substitute teacher,

34:26.400 --> 34:28.632
we always
just get a study period.

34:28.632 --> 34:29.666
Oh, really?

34:29.666 --> 34:31.266
What's your name, sweetheart?

34:31.266 --> 34:32.466
I'm Keely.

34:32.466 --> 34:33.533
Keely?

34:33.533 --> 34:35.199
Well, I'm going
to call you Bath Mat.

34:35.199 --> 34:36.533
[laughing]

34:36.533 --> 34:37.699
Not because of that
lovely vest you're wearing.

34:37.699 --> 34:39.632
It's because I think
you smell like feet.

34:39.632 --> 34:41.500
[laughing]

34:42.433 --> 34:45.033
Bath Mat, you have
detention after school.

34:45.033 --> 34:46.366
For what?

34:46.366 --> 34:48.366
Did you happen to notice
your classmate getting beat up?

34:48.366 --> 34:50.100
Yeah, but I wasn't doing it.

34:50.100 --> 34:52.166
No, but you laughed
and didn't help.

34:52.166 --> 34:53.400
It's just as bad.

34:53.400 --> 34:55.565
Detention, two hours.

34:55.565 --> 34:56.500
[laughing]

34:56.500 --> 34:57.500
And you!

34:57.500 --> 34:58.700
Detention all week.

34:58.700 --> 35:00.033
I have football practice!

35:00.033 --> 35:02.100
Not my problem.

35:02.100 --> 35:04.266
I love your outfit.

35:04.266 --> 35:05.266
Where did you get it?

35:05.266 --> 35:06.633
Salvation Army?

35:06.633 --> 35:07.766
[laughing]

35:07.766 --> 35:10.233
No, I got it from
someone named Lady Gaga.

35:10.233 --> 35:11.133
Heard of her?

35:11.133 --> 35:12.433
What?
Like, at a concert?

35:12.433 --> 35:13.466
No.

35:13.466 --> 35:14.733
Like, we're friends
from New York.

35:14.733 --> 35:16.000
[gasping]

35:16.000 --> 35:18.133
Yeah, and Britney Spears
is your sister.

35:18.133 --> 35:19.000
No.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.466
But Cher is my cousin.

35:20.466 --> 35:21.566
Bullshit.

35:21.566 --> 35:22.466
[laughing]

35:22.466 --> 35:23.433
What's your name?

35:23.433 --> 35:24.566
Oh, wait.

35:24.566 --> 35:25.733
I know what we're
going to call you.

35:25.733 --> 35:27.633
White Trash that Won't Burn.

35:27.633 --> 35:30.433
[laughing]

35:30.433 --> 35:31.600
[gasping]

35:32.400 --> 35:33.466
[groaning]

35:33.466 --> 35:35.200
Miss Dorito?

35:35.200 --> 35:36.400
[laughs]

35:36.400 --> 35:39.033
Hey, James and the
Giant Peach, keep it down.

35:39.033 --> 35:40.066
[laughing]

35:40.066 --> 35:41.366
You can't call me that.

35:41.366 --> 35:42.566
My parents are lawyers.

35:42.566 --> 35:44.200
Your parents are siblings.

35:44.200 --> 35:45.466
Now shut up!

35:47.333 --> 35:50.133
Look, we all pitched in
and got these for you.

35:50.133 --> 35:51.533
To welcome you to Milford High.

35:51.533 --> 35:54.033
Oh, how nice.

35:54.033 --> 35:57.233
Bath Mat, pass these out.

35:57.233 --> 35:58.733
They're for you.
[chuckles nervously]

35:58.733 --> 36:01.100
Hand them out
to the class, Bath Mat.

36:01.100 --> 36:03.100
I'm feeling very
generous today.

36:03.100 --> 36:05.166
Miss Del Rio,
may I have a word?

36:05.166 --> 36:06.533
Of course!

36:06.533 --> 36:11.433
What a lovely, unexpected
surprise, Deb...bie.

36:11.433 --> 36:12.766
Outside!

36:15.600 --> 36:17.333
(Students) Ooh!

36:17.333 --> 36:19.000
[laughing]

36:28.533 --> 36:31.000
I understand you're
new here, Miss Del Rio,

36:31.000 --> 36:33.700
but it is against school policy
to feed the students.

36:33.700 --> 36:35.033
So that's why you're here.

36:35.033 --> 36:37.033
You smell food.

36:37.033 --> 36:40.633
I wanted to give this to you
before you started your lesson.

36:40.633 --> 36:43.000
Creationism.
Hmm.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.366
Now, is this from
the school board,

36:44.366 --> 36:46.200
or your own personal collection?

36:46.200 --> 36:48.400
Well, we believe
in teaching an alternative.

36:48.400 --> 36:50.400
Miss Ward, these opinions

36:50.400 --> 36:52.566
are far more religious
than scientific.

36:52.566 --> 36:53.700
God created the universe.

36:53.700 --> 36:55.133
That's not an opinion.

36:55.133 --> 36:56.300
That's a fact.

36:56.300 --> 36:59.400
This is a science class,
not a Sunday school.

36:59.400 --> 37:02.366
Let me make something
very clear, Miss Del Rio.

37:02.366 --> 37:05.600
It is in your best interest
to get along with me.

37:05.600 --> 37:09.333
Let me make something
very clear to you, Debbie.

37:09.333 --> 37:11.000
I'm fucking this cat.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.400
You just hold the legs.

37:13.300 --> 37:14.666
Got it?

37:17.366 --> 37:18.766
[clapping]

37:20.366 --> 37:21.433
[laughing]

37:21.433 --> 37:22.400
Silence!

37:22.400 --> 37:24.333
Read chapter eight for tomorrow.

37:24.333 --> 37:26.433
There will be a quiz.

37:26.433 --> 37:28.366
(Karma)  Stay calm.

37:28.366 --> 37:31.400
There's eyelash glue in
the emergency kit I made you.

37:31.400 --> 37:33.200
Oh, yes! I found it.

37:33.200 --> 37:34.633
Thank you.

37:34.633 --> 37:37.766
There's also a disposable razor
in case you need a touch up.

37:37.766 --> 37:39.766
Nobody likes a hairy lady.

37:39.766 --> 37:41.300
You are a lifesaver.

37:41.300 --> 37:42.500
Mwah! Thanks.

37:44.300 --> 37:45.700
(Chuck)  You okay, pretty girl?

37:45.700 --> 37:48.433
Uh, yeah.
Everything's fine.

37:50.066 --> 37:52.600
You know this is
the men's room, don't you?

37:52.600 --> 37:53.766
God!

37:53.766 --> 37:56.700
Well, I don't...
I don't have my contacts in!

37:59.500 --> 38:01.366
So you're
the new science guru.

38:01.366 --> 38:04.033
Uh, yeah.
Today is my very first day.

38:04.033 --> 38:05.600
I'm, uh, Bianca.

38:05.600 --> 38:07.133
-Coach Chuck.
-Yeah.

38:07.133 --> 38:08.600
And good luck with that group.

38:08.600 --> 38:10.000
Yeah, they really are a...

38:10.000 --> 38:11.600
-a handful.
-Yeah.

38:11.600 --> 38:13.433
Lucky you weren't
here last year.

38:13.433 --> 38:15.233
Two of my kids climbed
to the roof and made bets

38:15.233 --> 38:17.733
on who's going to hit
the ground first if they jump.

38:17.733 --> 38:19.166
Shit.

38:19.166 --> 38:20.300
Well, they're fine now.

38:20.300 --> 38:22.500
-But it was a mess.
-Hmm.

38:22.500 --> 38:24.533
And you know
what the French say.

38:24.533 --> 38:27.333
Mi casa is su casa.

38:29.133 --> 38:33.166
-It means, That's life.
-Yeah.

38:33.166 --> 38:35.200
You are so cultured.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
I'm sure I'll be seeing you.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.366
I'm sure.

38:42.266 --> 38:43.666
[sighs]

38:44.433 --> 38:46.000
[cheering]

38:46.733 --> 38:48.200
Let's go, Mavericks!

38:48.200 --> 38:49.266
Whoo!

38:51.533 --> 38:53.233
That smells real good.

38:53.233 --> 38:54.633
Oh, it's honey gloss.

38:54.633 --> 38:56.300
It smells delicious.

38:56.300 --> 38:58.166
It tastes good, too.

38:59.400 --> 39:00.300
[cheering with excitement]

39:00.300 --> 39:02.100
(Announcer)  Touchdown!

39:02.100 --> 39:05.066
-Our team! Our team!
-That's the wrong team, stupid!

39:08.200 --> 39:09.100
(Cheerleaders)  Ready?

39:09.100 --> 39:09.766
Okay!

39:09.766 --> 39:12.033
U-G-L-Y...

39:12.033 --> 39:13.466
You ain't got no alibi!

39:13.466 --> 39:14.466
You ugly!

39:14.466 --> 39:16.366
Yes, yes, you ugly!

39:16.366 --> 39:17.366
Whoo!

39:17.366 --> 39:18.666
(Richard)  Oh, my God, ladies.

39:18.666 --> 39:21.100
That wouldn't ignite a fart.

39:21.100 --> 39:23.000
You think you can do better?

39:23.000 --> 39:25.200
Well, they can't get any worse.

39:25.200 --> 39:26.700
Will you shut up already?

39:26.700 --> 39:27.733
Will you?

39:28.133 --> 39:30.400
-Come on, Mavericks.
-Whoo!

39:30.400 --> 39:31.500
Whoo!

39:32.166 --> 39:35.033
Okay, ladies, you want
to make this happen?

39:35.033 --> 39:36.133
Let me show you something

39:36.133 --> 39:38.400
that Miley Cyrus
taught me in Amsterdam.

39:38.400 --> 39:39.400
Whoo!

39:39.400 --> 39:40.566
I know, I know.
Shh! Listen.

39:40.566 --> 39:42.066
So what you're going
to have to do first--

39:42.066 --> 39:43.533
(Announcer)  First down
for the visiting Bison,

39:43.533 --> 39:45.733
leaving Milford
trailing by four.

39:45.733 --> 39:47.566
Looks like any hope
the Mavericks had

39:47.566 --> 39:49.200
of breaking their losing streak

39:49.200 --> 39:50.466
will be dashed.

39:50.466 --> 39:51.500
Tits up!

39:51.500 --> 39:53.566
Sparkle, Meely, sparkle.

39:53.566 --> 39:55.233
Y-- Ugh.

39:55.233 --> 39:57.033
Hut! Hut!
Hike!

39:57.633 --> 40:00.233
One, two, three...

40:00.233 --> 40:02.033
...five, six, seven, eight.

40:02.033 --> 40:04.000
We are the Maverick girls!

40:04.000 --> 40:05.766
We wear our hair in curls!

40:05.766 --> 40:09.600
We wear our dungarees
above our dirty knees!

40:09.600 --> 40:11.433
We wear no underwear!

40:11.433 --> 40:13.300
Check out our derriere!

40:13.300 --> 40:14.300
Whoo!

40:14.733 --> 40:16.200
Whoo!

40:18.533 --> 40:20.666
Oh, my God!

40:20.666 --> 40:22.633
Oh, my God!

40:22.633 --> 40:24.366
Holy shit!

40:24.366 --> 40:25.400
[blows whistle]

40:25.400 --> 40:27.266
Touchdown!

40:27.266 --> 40:30.233
[cheering, exclaiming]

40:30.233 --> 40:32.300
Good work! Whoo!

40:32.300 --> 40:33.666
Cheer, damn it! Cheer!

40:33.666 --> 40:35.166
(Announcer)  This is the first
win of the season

40:35.166 --> 40:36.466
for the Mavericks.

40:36.466 --> 40:38.633
I did not say touch me.

40:38.633 --> 40:41.333
[shouting indistinctly,
cheering]

40:41.333 --> 40:42.733
Your hair smells delicious.

40:43.666 --> 40:47.466
[cheering]

40:58.766 --> 41:02.300
Another day with Miss Dorito.

41:02.300 --> 41:05.533
She's almost
as hot as Miss First.

41:05.533 --> 41:07.133
Almost.

41:07.133 --> 41:09.000
Come on,
you've never had Miss First.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.500
Neither have you.

41:10.500 --> 41:12.733
Frick and Frack,
this is not TV.

41:12.733 --> 41:14.333
I can hear you.

41:14.333 --> 41:16.033
So what do you say?

41:16.033 --> 41:18.766
I know a real romantic
spot under the bleachers.

41:18.766 --> 41:21.266
Oh, please.
I already gave to charity.

41:21.266 --> 41:22.533
[scoffing]

41:22.533 --> 41:23.700
Okay, shit stains!

41:23.700 --> 41:26.600
We're going to try
something new today.

41:26.600 --> 41:28.233
Did everybody do the reading?

41:28.233 --> 41:29.233
Hmm?

41:29.233 --> 41:31.433
White Trash?

41:31.433 --> 41:32.400
Muffin Top?

41:32.400 --> 41:33.433
[giggling]

41:33.433 --> 41:34.466
Man Boobs?

41:34.466 --> 41:35.633
[laughing]

41:35.633 --> 41:37.400
What about you, Bath Mat?

41:38.233 --> 41:39.733
Bath Mat?

41:39.733 --> 41:41.100
What?

41:41.100 --> 41:44.466
Did you do the reading?

41:44.466 --> 41:45.666
Yes.

41:45.666 --> 41:47.133
Good.

41:47.133 --> 41:49.300
Then you're going to
enjoy our little game today.

41:49.300 --> 41:53.000
Now, everyone take out the
volcanoes that I have prepared.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.500
Oh, yeah.

41:55.500 --> 41:59.200
Now please put on your safety
gear and follow my instructions.

41:59.200 --> 42:02.166
I am only going to ask once.

42:02.166 --> 42:04.500
Now remove the liquid bottles,

42:04.500 --> 42:07.733
and can anybody name
the dark bottle?

42:07.733 --> 42:09.100
Nitroglycerin.

42:09.100 --> 42:10.200
Speak up.

42:10.200 --> 42:12.266
Um, nit-- nitroglycerin.

42:12.266 --> 42:14.500
Yes!
Nitroglycerin.

42:14.500 --> 42:17.200
Nitroglycerin is a
colourless liquid that's used

42:17.200 --> 42:21.400
as an active ingredient
to manufacture explosives.

42:21.400 --> 42:22.733
Oh, yeah!
[chuckling]

42:22.733 --> 42:25.600
This is a very,
very interesting chemical.

42:25.600 --> 42:28.333
Now, can anybody tell me
what the second bottle is?

42:28.333 --> 42:29.766
Orange nitrate.

42:29.766 --> 42:31.466
That's correct!

42:31.466 --> 42:33.066
Orange nitrate.

42:33.066 --> 42:37.233
This chemical comes
in a variety of colours.

42:37.233 --> 42:41.433
The interesting thing
about orange nitrate is--

42:41.433 --> 42:42.733
[screaming]

42:46.533 --> 42:48.400
-Ooh!
-Oh!

42:48.400 --> 42:49.666
What the hell?

42:51.100 --> 42:52.566
[laughing]

42:52.566 --> 42:54.100
Your face is orange.

42:55.633 --> 42:57.033
So is yours.

42:57.033 --> 42:59.633
Oh, dear.

42:59.633 --> 43:02.666
You didn't happen to mix the two
chemicals together now, did you?

43:02.666 --> 43:04.233
[laughing]

43:04.233 --> 43:05.633
Was this a trick?

43:05.633 --> 43:07.533
Oh, please. If you'd have done
your homework assignment,

43:07.533 --> 43:09.133
you would know
that orange nitrate

43:09.133 --> 43:10.766
causes skin discoloration.

43:10.766 --> 43:12.000
What?

43:12.000 --> 43:14.433
Who looks like a Dorito now?

43:14.433 --> 43:16.466
[scoffs]

43:16.466 --> 43:18.066
There you are, children.

43:18.066 --> 43:21.133
This is what happens when
you don't do your homework.

43:21.133 --> 43:24.300
It's only going to get worse.
[bell rings]

43:27.333 --> 43:29.633
-Bye, Miss Del Rio.
-Hey!

43:29.633 --> 43:32.233
I notice you avoided
most of the damage today.

43:32.233 --> 43:33.400
Oh, well, yeah. I mean,

43:33.400 --> 43:35.066
I actually read
the chapter last week,

43:35.066 --> 43:36.300
so I knew the surprise,

43:36.300 --> 43:38.200
but that was
still really awesome.

43:38.200 --> 43:39.533
Good job, Bobby.

43:39.533 --> 43:41.366
You know my real name?

43:41.366 --> 43:42.533
Who am I fooling?

43:42.533 --> 43:45.000
Of course I know your real name.

43:45.000 --> 43:46.166
Now, tell me.

43:46.166 --> 43:47.366
What's going on here?

43:47.366 --> 43:49.766
Oh, I mean,
I could say something,

43:49.766 --> 43:51.600
but I've already
complained to Principal Wayne

43:51.600 --> 43:53.300
about a hundred times, so...

43:53.300 --> 43:54.700
What's the deal?

43:54.700 --> 43:58.133
There are these guys that
follow me home from school a lot

43:58.133 --> 44:01.366
and call me names, push me down.

44:01.366 --> 44:04.333
You know, Bobby, sometimes
people are douchebags

44:04.333 --> 44:06.266
just to make
themselves feel better.

44:06.266 --> 44:09.000
It has nothing to do with you.

44:09.000 --> 44:10.466
Now, do you have keys?

44:10.466 --> 44:11.500
Keys?

44:11.500 --> 44:12.366
Like house keys.

44:12.366 --> 44:13.233
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

44:13.233 --> 44:15.166
Let me show you a little trick
my mom taught me

44:15.166 --> 44:16.433
-when I was younger.
-Okay.

44:16.433 --> 44:18.033
What you do is you make a fist,

44:18.033 --> 44:20.233
and you put the keys
in between your fingers.

44:20.233 --> 44:22.033
-Like Wolverine?
-That's it!

44:22.033 --> 44:23.333
And listen, this is going
to leave a mark

44:23.333 --> 44:25.000
and you don't even
have to hit that hard.

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
-Revenge at its finest!
-That's it.

44:27.000 --> 44:28.300
[moaning in pain]

44:29.200 --> 44:30.500
Okay, Bobby.

44:30.500 --> 44:32.500
Why don't you just leave
the revenge to us grownups?

44:32.500 --> 44:34.233
-Okay?
-Okay.

44:35.533 --> 44:37.200
(Chuck)
Hey! Miss Del Rio!

44:37.200 --> 44:38.233
Hey, Coach Chuck!

44:38.233 --> 44:39.400
Big win last night.

44:39.400 --> 44:40.666
Congratulations.

44:40.666 --> 44:42.600
I gotta say, I saw how you
helped the girls last night.

44:42.600 --> 44:44.200
The cheers were
really something.

44:44.200 --> 44:46.166
Yeah, it's amazing what the
handicapped can accomplish.

44:46.166 --> 44:47.600
[chuckles]
You're funny.

44:47.600 --> 44:48.633
You should see me naked.

44:48.633 --> 44:50.066
[chuckling]
Really?

44:50.066 --> 44:51.166
You know what, Coach?

44:51.166 --> 44:52.500
There is something
I wanted to ask you.

44:52.500 --> 44:56.000
Some kids in my class were
talking about Miss First.

44:56.000 --> 44:57.500
-Who is she?
-No idea.

44:57.500 --> 44:58.733
Come on, Coach.
You gotta know.

44:58.733 --> 45:00.600
If I knew, I would tell you.

45:00.600 --> 45:02.233
Can I ask you something?

45:02.233 --> 45:03.300
I suppose.

45:03.300 --> 45:04.566
Can I take you out sometime?

45:04.566 --> 45:05.500
No.

45:05.500 --> 45:07.100
I'm not like most other guys.

45:07.100 --> 45:08.633
I'm not like most other women.

45:08.633 --> 45:09.733
So say yes.

45:10.266 --> 45:11.300
All right, Coach Chuck.

45:11.300 --> 45:13.066
You want to take
me out on a date,

45:13.066 --> 45:15.066
you better bring your A-game.

45:15.066 --> 45:17.300
I'll be ready after 6:00.

45:18.633 --> 45:21.300
I love it when
they play hard to get.

45:42.466 --> 45:44.133
Girl!

45:44.133 --> 45:46.133
Let's just say things are not
turning out as I had planned.

45:46.133 --> 45:47.366
Are you okay?

45:47.366 --> 45:50.000
Yeah, you can tell us anything.
We won't judge.

45:50.000 --> 45:51.000
All right.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.133
Well, for starters, I got fired
as soon as I got here,

45:53.133 --> 45:54.733
and then I had to start
dressing as a woman

45:54.733 --> 45:56.133
so I could get my job back.

45:56.133 --> 45:57.233
Then I started
lying to the children,

45:57.233 --> 45:58.633
telling them that
I knew famous people

45:58.633 --> 46:00.166
so that they would like me.

46:00.166 --> 46:01.733
I mean, who lies to children?

46:01.733 --> 46:02.633
Well...

46:02.633 --> 46:05.133
And to top it off, right now
I'm at a rollerskate rink

46:05.133 --> 46:07.100
with the football coach,
on a date,

46:07.100 --> 46:09.633
and he thinks my name is Bianca.

46:09.633 --> 46:10.533
Hello?

46:10.533 --> 46:12.533
Word, bitch! Yeah!

46:12.533 --> 46:15.000
-Yeah! Suck his dick.
-Uh-uh.

46:15.000 --> 46:16.066
He's actually taking a leak,

46:16.066 --> 46:17.333
and I'm trying
to grab us some beers.

46:17.333 --> 46:18.333
Oh!

46:18.333 --> 46:19.533
Don't drink too much.

46:19.533 --> 46:21.500
Yeah. Bad things happen
when you drink too much.

46:21.500 --> 46:23.033
Oh, really?
Coming from you?

46:23.033 --> 46:24.233
Don't try it.

46:24.233 --> 46:25.600
You remember that thing
with the candlestick?

46:25.600 --> 46:28.333
[cackles]
[laughs]

46:28.333 --> 46:30.300
I'll call you back later.
I've got things to do. Bye.

46:30.300 --> 46:31.700
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

46:31.700 --> 46:33.500
-Don't hit my phone, ho.
-Shh...

46:33.500 --> 46:34.600
-You don't pay my bill.
-...up.

46:34.600 --> 46:36.500
-You got a four.
-Change the channel.

46:36.500 --> 46:37.733
Ow!
[giggling]

46:38.400 --> 46:40.133
So I was going
to take you to a stuffy,

46:40.133 --> 46:41.000
fancy old restaurant,

46:41.000 --> 46:42.633
but I figured this would
be a way more fun way

46:42.633 --> 46:43.700
to get to know each other.

46:43.700 --> 46:45.566
Well, I love this place.

46:45.566 --> 46:47.333
It's really adorable.

46:47.333 --> 46:49.100
It's more than adorable.

46:49.100 --> 46:51.300
It's really romantic.

46:51.300 --> 46:53.100
Uh, yeah.

46:53.100 --> 46:55.200
And it also gives us
a lot of time to talk about

46:55.200 --> 46:57.200
that Miss First character.

46:57.200 --> 46:59.033
Are you still on that,
Nancy Drew?

46:59.033 --> 47:01.466
Actually, I look
more like Nancy Grace.

47:01.466 --> 47:04.200
But spill it! Spill it.
Tell me.

47:04.200 --> 47:07.333
She's what you call a myth,
which means she ain't real.

47:07.333 --> 47:09.566
Uh, yeah, I know
what a myth is, Chuck.

47:09.566 --> 47:13.333
Well, they say that Miss First
turns the boys into men,

47:13.333 --> 47:14.533
if you know what I mean.

47:14.533 --> 47:16.333
Oh, it's got
to be that Carly chick.

47:16.333 --> 47:18.333
She seems really trampy.

47:18.333 --> 47:19.666
What makes you think I know?

47:19.666 --> 47:21.333
Well, I would assume
you have her number

47:21.333 --> 47:23.200
in your little black book.

47:23.200 --> 47:24.533
How do you know about that?

47:24.533 --> 47:26.066
I mean, come on,
Fred Flintstone.

47:26.066 --> 47:27.233
Who the hell carries around

47:27.233 --> 47:28.566
a book with phone numbers
in it anymore?

47:28.566 --> 47:31.233
I only show that to folks
I'm trying to impress.

47:31.233 --> 47:34.600
Well, you're really
impressing me, Chuck.

47:34.600 --> 47:37.133
So tell me,
do you have a big family?

47:37.133 --> 47:39.433
You are really, really pretty.

47:39.433 --> 47:41.633
You are really, really drunk.

47:41.633 --> 47:43.433
So do you have any
brothers and sisters?

47:43.433 --> 47:46.566
I mean, it seems to be the
theme down here in the south.

47:46.566 --> 47:48.700
I want to kiss you
so bad right now.

47:48.700 --> 47:51.566
Listen, I'm trying to
get to know you, you idiot.

47:51.566 --> 47:53.566
You know,
you are as mean as a snake,

47:53.566 --> 47:55.500
and I love that about you.

47:58.333 --> 48:00.166
Look, I'm already
falling for you.

48:00.166 --> 48:02.400
Get up, you big oaf!

48:02.400 --> 48:03.433
Oh!

48:21.466 --> 48:22.766
Mm.

48:22.766 --> 48:25.133
Oh, mother of Christ.
We're late.

48:26.400 --> 48:28.433
What time is it?

48:28.433 --> 48:29.566
(Chuck) What's the matter?

48:29.566 --> 48:31.133
Uh, nothing.

48:31.133 --> 48:34.066
I just have the worst
morning breath ever.

48:34.066 --> 48:35.666
(Chuck) Did anything
happen between us?

48:35.666 --> 48:38.200
I mean, sex-wise?

48:38.200 --> 48:40.266
Oh, God. I hope not.

48:40.266 --> 48:43.133
(Chuck) Why would you say that?

48:43.133 --> 48:47.200
Because sex can ruin
a beautiful friendship.

48:50.066 --> 48:52.033
Not if you're real,
real good at it.

48:52.033 --> 48:54.500
Can you, like,
put all of that away, please?

48:56.766 --> 48:58.533
You can hitch a ride with me.

48:58.533 --> 49:00.200
You going to take
a quick shower?

49:00.200 --> 49:03.066
Uh, sometimes a lady needs
more than a quick shower.

49:03.066 --> 49:04.533
I hear you.

49:04.533 --> 49:07.266
All right.
[toilet flushes]

49:10.533 --> 49:14.266
She's as crooked as a dog's
hind legs, and you know it.

49:14.266 --> 49:16.266
And Principal Wayne knows it.

49:16.266 --> 49:17.566
I sure as hell do.

49:17.566 --> 49:20.266
She's worn out her welcome,
as far as I'm concerned.

49:20.266 --> 49:24.266
As long as I get a Teacher of
the Year nomination, I'm happy.

49:24.266 --> 49:25.533
I'll make sure of that.

49:25.533 --> 49:26.633
Don't you worry.

49:27.033 --> 49:28.366
We'll get rid of that skunk

49:28.366 --> 49:30.133
faster than shit
through a goose.

49:30.133 --> 49:32.633
[smacks her lips]

49:32.633 --> 49:35.133
Mama, you don't think they're
too big, though, do you?

49:35.133 --> 49:37.200
Oh, you look beautiful.
Come on.

49:52.666 --> 49:54.066
I knew it!

49:57.000 --> 49:58.166
I can explain.

49:58.166 --> 50:00.500
Shaving is a really,
really good exfoliator.

50:00.500 --> 50:02.666
You think I'm dumber than
a box of hammers, don't you?

50:03.566 --> 50:05.466
Yes, it's me. Richard.

50:05.466 --> 50:07.100
Yes, Richard from New York.

50:07.100 --> 50:08.300
Richard that everybody hates.

50:08.300 --> 50:09.100
Richard that got fired.

50:09.100 --> 50:10.200
You don't have to kneel.

50:10.200 --> 50:11.766
I can see you fine
from where you were.

50:11.766 --> 50:13.233
I-I wanted to kneel.

50:13.233 --> 50:14.500
That's really condescending.

50:14.500 --> 50:16.300
My feet hurt!
That's why.

50:16.300 --> 50:17.500
My feet hurt.
It's not all about you.

50:17.500 --> 50:18.533
Fine.

50:18.533 --> 50:20.300
I know this is going
to sound crazy,

50:20.300 --> 50:21.533
but after they got rid of me,

50:21.533 --> 50:23.433
who are they going
to get to teach these kids?

50:23.433 --> 50:24.300
Carly?

50:24.300 --> 50:25.500
Everyone thinks she's sweet,

50:25.500 --> 50:27.566
but she's just as much
of a jerk as her mom.

50:27.566 --> 50:29.100
You notice that too, huh?

50:29.100 --> 50:30.500
I notice everything.

50:30.500 --> 50:31.433
Do me a favour.

50:31.433 --> 50:33.033
Keep your eye on her,

50:33.033 --> 50:35.366
and let me know if she's got
any funny business going on.

50:35.366 --> 50:40.500
-You can count on me, sir.
-Oh, cute. Real cute.

50:40.500 --> 50:43.000
Why don't you go mop the
yellow brick road or something?

50:44.233 --> 50:46.766
To celebrate today
being a half day of school,

50:46.766 --> 50:49.200
we're going
to play a little game.

50:49.200 --> 50:50.200
[cheering]

50:50.200 --> 50:51.533
And here we go.

50:51.533 --> 50:54.766
Who can name the substance
that cells use

50:54.766 --> 50:57.633
as an immediate
source of energy?

50:59.333 --> 51:01.300
Keely?

51:01.300 --> 51:02.766
I wasn't raising my hand.

51:02.766 --> 51:04.400
Did you do the homework?

51:04.400 --> 51:06.500
Yeah.
I just don't know the answer.

51:06.500 --> 51:08.300
Come on up here, Keely.

51:08.300 --> 51:09.633
Come up.

51:10.366 --> 51:12.600
(Students) Ooh!
-Right here.

51:12.600 --> 51:15.633
Why didn't you complete
the assignment, Bath Mat?

51:15.633 --> 51:16.600
Um...

51:16.600 --> 51:18.133
Now, come here.
Stand closer.

51:18.133 --> 51:20.000
Closer so I look prettier.

51:20.000 --> 51:21.066
[laughing]

51:21.066 --> 51:22.500
Now, what did
you do last night?

51:22.500 --> 51:24.300
She went to a college party!

51:24.300 --> 51:26.233
Oh, really?

51:26.233 --> 51:28.100
How was that?

51:28.100 --> 51:31.266
Uh, the pool was filthy,
and the music was torrible.

51:31.266 --> 51:34.233
And that's worse than
terrible and horrible combined.

51:34.233 --> 51:36.400
-Sounds horrible.
-Uh, torrible.

51:36.400 --> 51:38.700
I think the real question is,
what did you do last night,

51:38.700 --> 51:40.100
Miss Del Rio?

51:40.100 --> 51:42.100
Coach Chuck said,
you were grade A.

51:42.100 --> 51:43.166
[chuckling]

51:43.166 --> 51:44.200
Get up here!

51:45.233 --> 51:46.533
(Students) Ooh!

51:47.733 --> 51:49.100
Now, look at me.

51:49.100 --> 51:50.000
Come here.

51:50.000 --> 51:50.700
Now, look at me.

51:50.700 --> 51:51.633
Both eyes.

51:51.633 --> 51:53.666
Bring that lazy one around.

51:53.666 --> 51:55.100
There we go. There we go.

51:55.100 --> 51:56.400
[laughing]

51:56.400 --> 51:57.433
Tell me, big man.

51:57.433 --> 51:59.166
What happened to your face?

51:59.166 --> 52:01.333
Oh, uh...

52:01.333 --> 52:03.633
My girlfriend got
a little wild last night.

52:03.633 --> 52:05.166
(Student)  Yeah!
(Richard)  Yeah, whatever.

52:05.166 --> 52:07.433
Okay, listen. The question is,

52:07.433 --> 52:10.566
what is the cause
of most infectious diseases?

52:10.566 --> 52:11.433
Oh, I know this one.

52:11.433 --> 52:14.300
Raise your hand.

52:14.300 --> 52:15.333
Keely?

52:15.333 --> 52:16.733
Microorganisms?

52:16.733 --> 52:18.366
Mm, pollutants.

52:18.366 --> 52:20.266
And Keely is correct!

52:20.266 --> 52:21.600
[applause]

52:21.600 --> 52:24.500
Now for a closer look
into more microorganisms,

52:24.500 --> 52:28.633
you could read page 43,
or just look into Tommy's pants.

52:28.633 --> 52:30.100
[laughing]

52:33.633 --> 52:35.766
It's a joke.
Good for you, Keely.

52:37.433 --> 52:38.700
[clapping]

52:41.100 --> 52:42.233
(Chuck) You need a ride home?

52:42.233 --> 52:43.600
Uh, no.
I'm-- I'm okay.

52:43.600 --> 52:46.533
I have a friend
picking me up, thanks.

52:46.533 --> 52:49.000
I had a real,
good time last night.

52:49.000 --> 52:52.166
Yeah.
Uh, me-- me too.

52:52.166 --> 52:53.166
[car horn beeping]

52:53.166 --> 52:54.133
Oh, you know what?
Th-that's her.

52:54.133 --> 52:55.600
Gotta go! Bye!

52:58.333 --> 52:59.566
[sighing]

53:02.233 --> 53:05.266
What the fucking fuck?

53:05.266 --> 53:06.533
It's not what it looks like.

53:06.533 --> 53:08.700
Are you sleeping
with my brother?

53:08.700 --> 53:10.133
No!

53:10.133 --> 53:13.333
Gross! Oh, no!

53:13.333 --> 53:15.333
I'm just messing with his head.

53:15.333 --> 53:18.600
Can I trust you
to stay away from my brother?

53:18.600 --> 53:20.100
Maybe you should talk to him.

53:20.100 --> 53:22.166
He might be a really cool guy,
for all you know.

53:22.166 --> 53:24.400
You have no idea.

53:24.400 --> 53:26.166
Just don't worry about it.

53:26.166 --> 53:28.033
He teaches
right across the hall.

53:28.033 --> 53:30.600
If you ever!

53:30.600 --> 53:32.100
Okay, fine.

53:32.100 --> 53:33.200
I will not talk about him.

53:33.200 --> 53:35.666
I will not talk about you,
or that hat!

53:35.666 --> 53:37.266
Oh!

53:37.733 --> 53:39.033
Drive!

53:39.033 --> 53:40.166
[engine starting]

53:40.166 --> 53:41.233
Slut!

53:43.233 --> 53:44.266
[slurping]

53:45.400 --> 53:47.666
So, um, are you
from around this area?

53:47.666 --> 53:49.766
Yeah.
A few miles outside of Milford.

53:49.766 --> 53:51.100
I really like it here.

53:51.100 --> 53:52.366
It's rather charming.

53:52.366 --> 53:53.300
I'm trying to convince
my brother

53:53.300 --> 53:54.500
to come down and visit sometime.

53:54.500 --> 53:58.266
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah, but, um...

53:58.266 --> 53:59.166
[whispering]
He's gay.

53:59.166 --> 54:00.366
Oh.

54:00.366 --> 54:02.133
Well, you know,
it's getting better down here.

54:02.133 --> 54:03.766
It used to be real bad
for gay dudes.

54:03.766 --> 54:04.666
Mm.

54:04.666 --> 54:06.533
Do, uh, you have any siblings?

54:09.766 --> 54:11.533
Can I tell you a secret?

54:11.533 --> 54:12.733
Sure.

54:12.733 --> 54:15.400
I had a gay brother too,
growing up.

54:15.400 --> 54:17.266
He used to get beat up a lot.

54:17.266 --> 54:19.700
Must have been a real
chick magnet for you.

54:19.700 --> 54:21.500
I never thought about that.

54:21.500 --> 54:23.666
It's not like I went to gay bars
with him or nothing.

54:23.666 --> 54:25.266
I would have.

54:25.266 --> 54:27.100
I just get annoyed
getting hit on by dudes.

54:27.100 --> 54:28.433
But I guess it comes
with the territory

54:28.433 --> 54:29.733
having an ass this good.

54:29.733 --> 54:30.766
[chuckles]

54:32.200 --> 54:34.666
So, um, what happened
to your brother?

54:34.666 --> 54:36.233
He ran away.

54:36.233 --> 54:39.766
I haven't seen him since
right before his 19th birthday,

54:39.766 --> 54:42.433
but I swear,
I'd give my right nut

54:42.433 --> 54:44.233
to know that
little shit is okay.

54:47.066 --> 54:49.566
He brought it up!
I promise!

54:49.566 --> 54:50.700
Get out!

54:50.700 --> 54:52.333
What?

54:52.333 --> 54:55.233
I specifically asked you not
to stir anything up with him.

54:55.233 --> 54:57.133
But this is good news!

54:57.133 --> 54:58.366
At least it's a start.

54:58.366 --> 55:00.100
I really think
you should talk to him.

55:00.100 --> 55:02.466
I really think you should
mind your own business!

55:02.466 --> 55:03.433
Let me get this straight.

55:03.433 --> 55:05.033
You have a radio show

55:05.033 --> 55:06.533
where you give people advice
about relationship problems,

55:06.533 --> 55:08.366
and the way that you
deal with your own

55:08.366 --> 55:10.000
is by running away from them?

55:10.000 --> 55:11.766
You don't know
these people, Richard.

55:11.766 --> 55:13.300
Do you think
my parents were happy

55:13.300 --> 55:14.633
when they found out I was gay?

55:14.633 --> 55:15.633
No!

55:15.633 --> 55:18.233
But eventually,
they came around.

55:18.233 --> 55:21.133
My situation
is a little bit different!

55:21.133 --> 55:24.233
All I'm saying is that you can't
judge people for mistreating you

55:24.233 --> 55:27.300
about something that
they know nothing about.

55:27.300 --> 55:30.566
All I'm saying is you
don't have to go home,

55:30.566 --> 55:34.000
but you can't stay here!

55:34.000 --> 55:35.200
[sighs]

55:38.266 --> 55:40.066
[gasps]

55:52.000 --> 55:54.100
[cackling]

56:03.300 --> 56:05.700
Grand Inn.
Can you hold, please?

56:05.700 --> 56:07.200
Okay.

56:07.200 --> 56:10.166
Two twin beds
or a single queen?

56:10.166 --> 56:12.033
A single queen.

56:12.033 --> 56:14.166
[sobbing]

56:15.600 --> 56:17.566
Single queen.

56:17.566 --> 56:19.100
Oh, dear.

56:19.100 --> 56:20.400
(Karma on radio)
Take my advice.

56:20.400 --> 56:22.666
Whatever it is
you're going through,

56:22.666 --> 56:26.266
surround yourself with
as many friends as possible.

56:26.266 --> 56:30.233
This is the time
to patch up old relationships.

56:30.233 --> 56:33.100
That's it for the
Karma Sutra  show.

56:33.100 --> 56:35.000
Good night.

56:35.000 --> 56:37.533
(Voice outside)  Listen,
this was your stupid ass idea.

56:37.533 --> 56:39.166
Girl, can you get off  Grinder
for a second

56:39.166 --> 56:40.366
and do something useful?

56:40.366 --> 56:41.733
Useful?
I wanted to text Richard,

56:41.733 --> 56:43.366
and tell him we were
coming the fuck down here,

56:43.366 --> 56:45.533
but you said, No,
let's make it a surprise!

56:45.533 --> 56:48.666
Oh, my God!
What are you guys doing here?

56:48.666 --> 56:50.600
You better tie your shoes
because you're tripping, bitch!

56:50.600 --> 56:52.000
Hey!

56:52.000 --> 56:53.600
Richard!

56:53.600 --> 56:56.333
Oh, we decided to stop on
our way down to  White Party  .

56:56.333 --> 56:58.533
Yeah, this is a
really shitty place.

56:58.533 --> 56:59.733
I'll explain.

56:59.733 --> 57:01.733
So we asked for
a room with one bed.

57:01.733 --> 57:04.733
Because it was cheaper
and not because-- gross.

57:04.733 --> 57:06.633
You should be so lucky. Ha.

57:06.633 --> 57:08.033
Anyway,

57:08.033 --> 57:09.400
but when that cigarette-smoking
lunch lady bitch

57:09.400 --> 57:11.700
behind the counter
realized we were two dudes,

57:11.700 --> 57:15.366
she changed the reservation from
one queen to two double beds,

57:15.366 --> 57:17.666
which was $50 more.

57:17.666 --> 57:20.400
You know I cannot take you
seriously looking like that.

57:20.400 --> 57:22.633
You don't think I'm pretty?

57:22.633 --> 57:24.700
You're the prettiest
girl on the planet...

57:24.700 --> 57:27.000
(Both) ...of the apes!
[laughing]

57:28.366 --> 57:30.200
So what else did we miss?

57:30.200 --> 57:32.466
Well, I just think
everybody was right.

57:32.466 --> 57:34.000
What the hell am I doing here?

57:34.000 --> 57:36.166
You're following your dreams.
That's adorable.

57:36.166 --> 57:38.366
Well, it looks like I'm going
to be following y'all back home.

57:38.366 --> 57:40.166
You say y'all now?

57:40.166 --> 57:42.100
-Stay here. Barf.
-Shut up.

57:42.100 --> 57:44.200
Richard, why would you quit?

57:44.200 --> 57:47.300
Well, to be honest, A, the
kids are already doing better,

57:47.300 --> 57:49.000
B, I'm going to get fired again,

57:49.000 --> 57:53.066
and, C, I miss brunch.

57:53.066 --> 57:54.233
Come to  White Party  !

57:54.233 --> 57:55.300
Yeah!
Come to  White Party  !

57:55.300 --> 57:56.700
No, no, no. I said brunch.

57:56.700 --> 57:58.200
Eggs are white.

58:01.066 --> 58:02.400
Nice, job, Tommy.

58:03.533 --> 58:04.766
Mr. Bobby.

58:05.633 --> 58:07.100
Here you go.

58:07.100 --> 58:08.166
I got a B-plus!

58:08.166 --> 58:10.200
[gasps]
I've never even got a B before.

58:10.200 --> 58:11.700
Very well-written, Bath Mat.

58:11.700 --> 58:13.733
You actually
have a bright future.

58:13.733 --> 58:16.133
If you work hard!

58:18.200 --> 58:19.500
Oh, my God!

58:19.500 --> 58:21.433
I got a B-minus.

58:21.433 --> 58:24.166
That is so unexpected.

58:24.166 --> 58:27.500
Well, I guess you're no longer
the dumbest class in school.

58:27.500 --> 58:29.333
At least on paper.

58:29.333 --> 58:30.566
[chuckling]
[intercom beeps]

58:30.566 --> 58:32.000
Please excuse the interruption.

58:32.000 --> 58:33.366
Miss Del Rio?

58:33.366 --> 58:36.566
Principal Wayne would
like to see you after class.

58:36.566 --> 58:37.733
(Students) Ooh!

58:37.733 --> 58:38.633
What'd you do?

58:38.633 --> 58:40.033
Come on! Tell us!

58:41.466 --> 58:42.500
Shut up!

58:42.500 --> 58:44.066
[laughing]

58:44.333 --> 58:48.533
Principal Wayne,
your daughter is gorgeous!

58:48.533 --> 58:49.566
That's my wife.

58:50.366 --> 58:51.566
Oh!

58:51.566 --> 58:55.600
It's your wife.
Well, she's, uh, very blonde.

58:55.600 --> 58:58.566
I've asked you to come here
because I'm, uh,

58:58.566 --> 59:01.766
faced with a very
difficult decision.

59:01.766 --> 59:03.533
Join the club.

59:03.533 --> 59:05.600
I notice you've been taking a...

59:05.600 --> 59:08.700

01:08:58.265 --> 01:09:03.000
to introduce some of our
very talented staff tonight.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.200
And pinch me now!

01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:08.133
We have a very special guest.

01:09:08.133 --> 01:09:09.765
I still can't believe it.

01:09:09.765 --> 01:09:14.466
Lady Gaga took time out
of her very busy schedule

01:09:14.466 --> 01:09:16.600
to join us this evening.

01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:18.600
[applause/cheering]

01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:21.100
Are you having
a good time, Gaga?

01:09:21.100 --> 01:09:22.000
Mm-hmm.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.500
Can you tell that to your face?

01:09:25.233 --> 01:09:29.233
Unfortunately, one of our
teachers, Miss Del Rio,

01:09:29.233 --> 01:09:33.200
had some problems
and was forced to resign.

01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:36.100
[moaning, muttering]

01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:37.233
When did this happen?

01:09:37.233 --> 01:09:39.200
It's all under control, Wayne.

01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:41.000
-Shay-shay.
-Very shady.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.500
(Superintendent)
But not to worry.

01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:46.366
Milford High will
still be represented.

01:09:46.366 --> 01:09:51.700
They decided to send
Carly Ward as an alternate.

01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:53.433
[applause]

01:09:58.466 --> 01:10:00.033
(Richard)  Scientists
have warned residents

01:10:00.033 --> 01:10:03.200
to beware of storms
with female names,

01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:06.366
as they are perceived
to be less threatening,

01:10:06.366 --> 01:10:10.300
but are significantly
more likely to kill you.

01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:16.000
Now let's take a moment to get
to know some of our nominees.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.400
[applause]

01:10:19.700 --> 01:10:22.166
Our first nominee is

01:10:22.166 --> 01:10:25.466
Mr. Homer Flint
from Nacogdoches.

01:10:25.466 --> 01:10:28.000
[applause]

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.666
Homer is a favourite
at this high school

01:10:30.666 --> 01:10:34.300
because of some of his strong
and visionary leadership,

01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:39.100
a clear vision of his goals,
and his impeccable style.

01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:40.600
[laughing]

01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:47.300
Our next nominee
is from Meadowlakes...

01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:49.333
Sue Ellen Spencer.

01:10:49.333 --> 01:10:55.566
She is known for her fun, laid
back creative writing classes...

01:10:55.566 --> 01:10:58.700
-Huh?
-Sex scandal! Oh!

01:10:58.700 --> 01:11:00.766
What is going down
in the school yard?

01:11:00.766 --> 01:11:02.366
Them desks is dirty.

01:11:02.366 --> 01:11:04.166
[gasping, murmuring]
Huh?

01:11:05.533 --> 01:11:07.300
Oh!
This thing is broken.

01:11:07.300 --> 01:11:08.433
Shut it down!

01:11:08.433 --> 01:11:09.533
[whistles]
Shut it down!

01:11:09.533 --> 01:11:10.666
What the hell?

01:11:11.566 --> 01:11:12.666
[gasping, murmuring]
(Deb)  Hey!

01:11:12.666 --> 01:11:14.266
This-- this isn't--
Shut this down!

01:11:14.266 --> 01:11:16.166
Oh, my God!

01:11:16.166 --> 01:11:17.700
Not in my school!

01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:19.066
That's not me!

01:11:19.066 --> 01:11:20.233
That's not me!
It's just...

01:11:20.233 --> 01:11:22.200
It's... It's any short person.

01:11:24.066 --> 01:11:25.633
What the hell?

01:11:30.133 --> 01:11:33.366
Things have taken
a strange turn here.

01:11:33.366 --> 01:11:37.533
Miss First, the mysterious, and
up until now, anonymous woman

01:11:37.533 --> 01:11:41.566
that has been seducing
young boys has been revealed

01:11:41.566 --> 01:11:43.400
as Deborah Ward!

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:45.400
Oh, quiet down, everybody!

01:11:46.666 --> 01:11:47.700
Oh, God!

01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:50.066
Look, this is not true!

01:11:50.066 --> 01:11:52.333
This is a conspiracy!

01:11:54.166 --> 01:11:57.200
[murmuring, shouting]

01:12:00.766 --> 01:12:01.766
[grunting]

01:12:07.333 --> 01:12:09.666
Will somebody fix
the dang projector already?!

01:12:12.633 --> 01:12:13.766
Oh!

01:12:13.766 --> 01:12:15.000
Oh!
[gasping]

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:18.166
What...
It's biting me!

01:12:18.166 --> 01:12:19.666
Ah!
[deflating sound]

01:12:19.666 --> 01:12:23.066
[laughing]

01:12:23.066 --> 01:12:24.166
Oh!
[laughs]

01:12:24.166 --> 01:12:25.333
Girl!

01:12:25.333 --> 01:12:27.533
[gasping]

01:12:27.533 --> 01:12:29.000
[deflating sound]

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.066
[laughing]

01:12:31.066 --> 01:12:32.400
Did she just get botched?

01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:34.133
She's going to need a Band-Aid!

01:12:36.633 --> 01:12:38.033
No!

01:12:38.033 --> 01:12:39.133
No!

01:12:40.066 --> 01:12:41.100
(Deb)  Where are you?

01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:42.400
Pick up!
Pick up, Willie!

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:44.500
Willie, pick up!

01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:48.200
[muffled yelling]
Let me out of here!

01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:49.700
Somebody let me out of here!

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:52.133
(Deb) Willie!

01:12:52.133 --> 01:12:54.000
Willie, get back
to me right now!

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.333
Oh!

01:12:55.333 --> 01:12:56.733
[moaning]
Ooh.

01:12:56.733 --> 01:12:58.333
[toilet flushing]

01:12:58.333 --> 01:13:00.066
Oh, Debbie!

01:13:00.066 --> 01:13:02.366
Don't you look fancy tonight?

01:13:02.366 --> 01:13:03.533
You!

01:13:03.533 --> 01:13:05.233
Sorry I'm a little late.

01:13:05.233 --> 01:13:07.166
I was tied up!

01:13:08.466 --> 01:13:10.333
Give me these!

01:13:10.333 --> 01:13:11.700
Get out of my way.

01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:13.666
Has anybody
ever told you, Debbie,

01:13:13.666 --> 01:13:16.366
that you have
beautifully shaped lips?

01:13:16.366 --> 01:13:17.266
Yes.

01:13:17.266 --> 01:13:18.600
[chuckling]
And you know

01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:21.533
you need to be really careful
with that face of yours.

01:13:21.533 --> 01:13:25.066
You might attract
a swarm of men.

01:13:25.066 --> 01:13:26.300
[laughing]

01:13:31.566 --> 01:13:33.700
[screaming]

01:13:33.700 --> 01:13:35.133
Oh, my God!

01:13:35.133 --> 01:13:37.366
Oh, my God!
It's just like  My Girl  !

01:13:37.366 --> 01:13:39.633
Oh! Oh!

01:13:39.633 --> 01:13:41.566
[screaming]

01:13:43.333 --> 01:13:46.666
Without further ado, I'd like
to announce the winner,

01:13:46.666 --> 01:13:48.733
before anything else
falls on us.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:54.700
The winner of this year's
Teacher of the Year award is...

01:13:54.700 --> 01:13:56.333
Well, this is awkward.

01:13:56.333 --> 01:13:58.133
Carly Ward?

01:13:58.133 --> 01:13:59.566
[gasping, murmuring]

01:14:00.466 --> 01:14:02.300
Rigged!

01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:03.733
Wh-- Oh...

01:14:03.733 --> 01:14:06.700
Superintendent Howard!
The information

01:14:06.700 --> 01:14:09.033
that disqualified
our original nominee

01:14:09.033 --> 01:14:12.533
was given to you
on false pretenses.

01:14:12.533 --> 01:14:15.066
What makes you
say that, Wayne?

01:14:15.066 --> 01:14:20.266
Because Deborah Ward and her
daughter are filthy liars!

01:14:20.266 --> 01:14:22.566
-We want Bianca!
-Yeah, we want Bianca!

01:14:22.566 --> 01:14:23.433
Bianca!

01:14:23.433 --> 01:14:24.466
Bianca!

01:14:24.466 --> 01:14:25.433
Bianca!

01:14:25.433 --> 01:14:28.633
[chanting continues]
Bianca!

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.300
(Chuck) Bianca.

01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:48.366
Where you been?

01:14:48.366 --> 01:14:50.133
I think Lady Gaga
was hitting on me.

01:14:50.133 --> 01:14:51.100
Oh, yeah?

01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:52.066
But don't worry.

01:14:52.066 --> 01:14:53.566
I told her I was already taken.

01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:01.600
[chanting Bianca continues]

01:15:03.233 --> 01:15:05.300
[clapping and cheering]
Bianca!

01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:07.400
Do you think we need a recount?

01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:09.333
[clapping and cheering]

01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:17.233
Well all right then.

01:15:19.066 --> 01:15:21.400
Thank you, District 214.

01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:24.733
When I started, I didn't know
if I was going to fit in,

01:15:24.733 --> 01:15:26.600
but one thing that
was consistent

01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:28.733
was this remarkable staff

01:15:28.733 --> 01:15:30.333
who didn't skip a beat

01:15:30.333 --> 01:15:32.500
in allowing me into
their community.

01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:37.066
When I arrived, every single
student I had was failing.

01:15:37.066 --> 01:15:40.666
Each one has shown
improvement of at least 40%.

01:15:41.100 --> 01:15:42.366
All of this,

01:15:44.266 --> 01:15:46.466
coming from someone
you said,

01:15:46.466 --> 01:15:49.000
was an embarrassment
to your community.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.100
[gasping]
What?

01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:51.566
Holy fucking shit.

01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:54.000
(Both) I knew it.

01:15:56.333 --> 01:15:57.766
She's a dude?

01:15:59.133 --> 01:16:00.533
A man.

01:16:02.066 --> 01:16:03.566
A man?

01:16:04.133 --> 01:16:06.600
I got punked.

01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:09.000
That was really fucking good.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.700
[laughing]

01:16:13.266 --> 01:16:15.733
This is Bianca.

01:16:15.733 --> 01:16:19.033
[confetti popping]

01:16:19.033 --> 01:16:21.133
[gasping and laughing]

01:16:29.533 --> 01:16:31.366
It's messed up my hair.

01:16:38.766 --> 01:16:40.733
Oh, it's pretty.

01:16:40.733 --> 01:16:41.600
Yes!

01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:43.133
Word!

01:16:54.566 --> 01:16:58.566
All of you have some very
serious explaining to do.

01:16:58.566 --> 01:17:01.233
I can barely move my mouth.

01:17:01.233 --> 01:17:03.200
Beestung lips
are really in right now.

01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:05.600
[crying] Do you know
how expensive these were?

01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:07.366
Oh, baby.

01:17:07.566 --> 01:17:10.500
I must say,
I have seen better behavior

01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:13.133
from some of your
worst students!

01:17:13.133 --> 01:17:15.433
Richard, do me a favor?

01:17:16.433 --> 01:17:19.000
Take a look at the front page.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.633
[crying]
Why? Why?

01:17:21.633 --> 01:17:25.433
'Why is my school racist against
gay people?' By Keely Carson.

01:17:25.433 --> 01:17:26.733
Oh, Wayne, come on.

01:17:26.733 --> 01:17:28.166
You cannot give in

01:17:28.166 --> 01:17:31.166
to these kinds
of special interest groups.

01:17:31.166 --> 01:17:32.233
Chuck.

01:17:32.233 --> 01:17:33.300
On it.

01:17:33.566 --> 01:17:34.700
Sorry, ma'am, the Principal

01:17:34.700 --> 01:17:36.200
asked me to be here
for extra security.

01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:38.333
What? Hey, let go of me,
you overgrown maggot! Hey--

01:17:38.333 --> 01:17:41.166
Don't think I want be
calling the law, Miss Ward.

01:17:41.166 --> 01:17:42.100
Oh, are you kidding me?

01:17:42.100 --> 01:17:43.400
Is this a joke?

01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:45.600
Come on! That kid's been
held back, like, six times.

01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:47.600
He said he was legal!

01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:49.633
He did!
Did you see that guy?

01:17:49.633 --> 01:17:51.366
Now, as for you, young lady.

01:17:51.366 --> 01:17:52.700
[Deb continues to rant]

01:17:52.700 --> 01:17:55.733
I have no proof that you
were involved in any of this.

01:17:55.733 --> 01:17:57.533
Looks like you've
suffered enough already.

01:17:57.533 --> 01:17:58.733
(Deb) You know who
you're messing with?

01:17:58.733 --> 01:18:01.666
And to think I was going
to let you touch these!

01:18:01.666 --> 01:18:04.166
[crying]

01:18:04.166 --> 01:18:05.566
Just one more thing, Richard.

01:18:07.066 --> 01:18:08.133
Yes, sir.

01:18:08.133 --> 01:18:11.366
Please stay out
of the ladies' room.

01:18:11.366 --> 01:18:12.433
[laughing]

01:18:12.433 --> 01:18:14.000
I'll try.

01:18:16.566 --> 01:18:17.500
[call, speak indistinctly]

01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:19.366
(Keely's voice)  I used to be
one of those people

01:18:19.366 --> 01:18:20.766
that didn't really
care about gay people,

01:18:20.766 --> 01:18:22.233
but then we had this teacher,

01:18:22.233 --> 01:18:24.600
and everyone was
torrible to him, including me.

01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:27.566
But I didn't think he would
get fired or anything.

01:18:27.566 --> 01:18:28.533
(Richard)  All right, guys!

01:18:28.533 --> 01:18:30.200
Who's ready to graduate?

01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:32.266
(Keely) Furthermore so,
I think the school should have,

01:18:32.266 --> 01:18:35.000

program, or something,

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.366
to protect gay people.

Because my friend Bobby
is a total homo,

01:18:41.100 --> 01:18:43.433
but he won't come out because
he'll probably get beat up.

01:18:43.433 --> 01:18:45.666
Well, at least more so
than he already does.

01:18:45.666 --> 01:18:48.200
Anyway, thank you
for reading my article.

with a drunk, straight girl.

01:19:26.333 --> 01:19:28.500
Do we have any drunk,
straight girls in the audience?

Thumbelina, come on up!

of the Lady Maverick
cheerleading squad,

01:19:51.466 --> 01:19:54.766

On your fucking phones. Rude.

on Stephen's futon,

Hurricane Bianca was
