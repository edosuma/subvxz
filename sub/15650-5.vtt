ONE, TWO, THREE...

23:01.379 --> 23:03.632
{\an1}LIFT.

23:06.718 --> 23:09.346
AND NOW,
THE APPROPRIATE DIRGE.

23:09.429 --> 23:12.224
(<i> sobbing</i> )

23:12.307 --> 23:15.477
(<i> humming</i>
<i>"Here Comes the Bride"</i> )

23:24.903 --> 23:27.948
{\an1}WE ARE GATHERED HERE TODAY
TO PAY OUR LAST RESPECTS

23:28.031 --> 23:29.825
TO OUR BELOVED ED BIGHEAD.

23:29.908 --> 23:33.787
HE WASTED AWAY HIS ENTIRE LIFE
WORRYING ABOUT HOW OLD HE WAS.

23:33.870 --> 23:34.996
HEFF.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.748
{\an1}THE LID.

23:39.042 --> 23:41.419
{\an1}ASHES TO ASHES,
DUST TO DUST

23:41.503 --> 23:44.297
{\an1}WE STICK ED BIGHEAD
IN THE EARTH'S CRUST.

23:46.758 --> 23:48.093
(<i> groaning</i> )

23:48.176 --> 23:52.889
(<i> all screaming and crying</i> )

23:52.973 --> 23:55.725
{\an1}DOES ANYONE
HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD?

23:55.809 --> 23:58.019
OH, I ALMOST FORGOT.

23:59.437 --> 24:00.397
THE GARBAGE.

24:00.480 --> 24:02.399
(<i> clanging</i> )

24:02.482 --> 24:05.569
{\an5}Filburt:
OKAY, BRING IN
THE CEMENT TRUCK.

24:07.696 --> 24:10.115
NO! NO!

24:10.198 --> 24:12.450
I'M ALIVE! I'M ALIVE!

24:12.534 --> 24:14.661
{\an1}I'M NOT DEAD!
I'M YOUNG AND ALIVE.

24:14.744 --> 24:17.122
{\an1}I'M ALIVE!

24:20.834 --> 24:24.462
(<i> singing to himself</i> )

24:27.799 --> 24:30.260
BIGHEAD, CAN I SEE YOU

24:30.343 --> 24:31.553
A MINUTE?

24:33.889 --> 24:37.058
{\an1}BIGHEAD, IT LOOKS AS THOUGH
WE'VE GOT ANOTHER OPENING

24:37.142 --> 24:38.894
IN THE HOT TUB DEPARTMENT.

24:38.977 --> 24:41.229
WE'D LIKE
TO FILL THAT POSITION

24:41.313 --> 24:43.732
WITH SOMEONE WITH AGE
AND EXPERIENCE.

24:43.815 --> 24:46.401
THAT'S WHY WE'VE CHOSEN...

24:46.484 --> 24:49.321
CARBUNCLE HERE.

24:49.404 --> 24:51.865
WOW, WOW, WOW!

24:51.948 --> 24:53.408
WOW!

24:53.491 --> 24:55.076
LET'S FACE IT,

24:55.160 --> 24:57.579
