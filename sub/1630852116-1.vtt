WEBVTT

00:33.199 --> 00:37.579
It's the invincible team of
the greatest heroes, The Union of Justice.

00:38.121 --> 00:42.125
Our heroes are always out there
working to keep the peace for us.

00:42.208 --> 00:45.045
Tonight, we've got
The Utopian and The Flare.

00:45.128 --> 00:47.547
Where are they this time?

00:47.630 --> 00:52.927
Hey there! The Flare and I are
on patrol here in San Carlos, San Diego.

00:53.011 --> 00:55.096
How are you, good boys and girls?

00:55.180 --> 00:56.264
-Great!
-Great!

00:58.475 --> 00:59.476
I'm glad to hear it!

01:05.565 --> 01:09.069
Like always, let's review
the seven rules of being a hero.

01:10.612 --> 01:11.613
One!

01:14.616 --> 01:15.825
I was watching!

01:15.909 --> 01:18.536
You can't watch TV all night.

01:18.620 --> 01:20.205
Get to bed.

01:20.288 --> 01:23.666
Why? You know I love this show!

01:23.750 --> 01:25.835
That's enough for today. Now go to bed.

01:26.711 --> 01:28.046
It's still only 7:00 p.m.

01:29.589 --> 01:31.049
It's Randy!

01:31.132 --> 01:32.467
Hurry up and go to your room.

01:34.260 --> 01:35.595
Now I get it.

01:40.183 --> 01:41.643
Welcome, Randy!

01:43.937 --> 01:45.355
Hurry up. Come inside.

01:49.150 --> 01:51.861
I'll escape this place someday.

02:11.172 --> 02:12.715
You're still up?

02:12.799 --> 02:15.468
Go to sleep, will you?

02:30.942 --> 02:33.778
I've had it with you! No more of that!

02:34.529 --> 02:36.573
You'll ruin our wonderful night!

02:36.656 --> 02:40.368
As it is, it's already been ages
since I had a man over, thanks to you!

02:40.451 --> 02:43.580
You're ruining the mood!
Do it again and you'll be sorry!

02:43.663 --> 02:45.832
I didn't do anything! It wasn't me!

02:45.915 --> 02:48.668
Quit lying! It can't turn itself on and…

02:49.627 --> 02:50.461
What?

02:52.005 --> 02:53.214
It's not me!

02:57.510 --> 02:59.470
Hey! It's a blackout!

03:01.639 --> 03:03.349
Must be the fuse.

03:03.433 --> 03:05.268
Damn this rundown shack.

03:06.394 --> 03:07.812
Hurry up and go to sleep.

03:12.984 --> 03:15.111
It wasn't me…

03:16.779 --> 03:18.156
It wasn't me, but…

03:59.530 --> 04:00.406
Yes!

04:55.420 --> 04:58.256
It was… me!

05:03.970 --> 05:06.431
Sorry. I came.

05:06.514 --> 05:09.434
You're kidding. Because of that?

05:18.943 --> 05:20.945
-Hi, Tom.
-Johnny!

05:21.029 --> 05:23.781
Did you see the news
last night about The Utopian?

05:24.282 --> 05:25.491
I was too busy for that.

05:25.575 --> 05:28.077
Seriously? There's no way!

05:31.289 --> 05:33.041
I've realized…

05:34.584 --> 05:36.044
my amazing power.

05:37.712 --> 05:39.714
What? Has he lost his mind?

05:40.298 --> 05:41.549
I'm the real deal!

05:42.300 --> 05:45.053
-Watch out!
-Don't worry. Just you watch!

05:53.978 --> 05:54.812
See?

05:58.066 --> 05:59.484
What's going on with you, Johnny?

06:00.068 --> 06:01.778
Tom, it's him.

06:01.861 --> 06:04.113
-This tape is awesome.
-Yeah.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.157
We'll be in trouble if he sees us.

06:12.413 --> 06:14.749
Something reeks. Like piss.

06:15.333 --> 06:17.085
Oh, it's those guys.

06:17.168 --> 06:18.544
Just keep walking, Johnny.

06:24.967 --> 06:26.719
Hey! What?

06:27.303 --> 06:28.805
What's going on with this thing?

06:29.972 --> 06:31.557
What the fuck?

06:32.141 --> 06:33.059
See?

06:33.142 --> 06:35.728
Are you serious? Johnny!

06:46.030 --> 06:46.864
Did you see that?

06:49.367 --> 06:50.326
That's awesome, Johnny!

06:51.702 --> 06:52.578
Quit shouting.

06:53.121 --> 06:54.497
How did you get like that?

06:55.623 --> 06:57.041
To be honest, I don't know.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.378
But when I just wish for it in my head,

07:00.461 --> 07:04.298
I can feel like
an electric shock surging inside my body.

07:05.341 --> 07:06.217
Is it like

07:06.300 --> 07:10.221
the son of Brainwave when his powers
were awakened during the Boston riots?

07:13.224 --> 07:14.058
Watch this.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.312
That sure isn't static electricity.

07:20.189 --> 07:24.652
I knew it.
You've awakened your hero powers.

07:25.236 --> 07:26.737
I've got superpowers?

07:26.821 --> 07:28.865
That's right. You're a superhero.

07:29.490 --> 07:31.993
You can feel that power, right?
You should know.

07:32.076 --> 07:33.995
Yeah. I can tell.

07:34.996 --> 07:37.206
You really are a…

07:38.374 --> 07:42.753
Look. I drew this about that legend
of what happened on that island.

07:42.837 --> 07:44.380
You mean Jupiter's Legacy?

07:44.464 --> 07:47.091
-You really love that, don't you?
-Yeah.

07:47.175 --> 07:51.220
I want to take a photo like this someday
and have it on the cover of a magazine.

07:51.804 --> 07:54.307
You'd be like an exclusive
superhero cameraman.

07:55.016 --> 07:57.852
It's going too far
to say I'd be a pro though.

07:57.935 --> 07:59.854
No, I'm sure you can do it.

07:59.937 --> 08:01.355
Thanks, Johnny.

08:01.439 --> 08:04.025
Those heroes with superpowers started with

08:04.108 --> 08:07.236
those people who went to
that mysterious island on that ship.

08:07.820 --> 08:11.991
And the kids of those first people
have superpowers too.

08:12.867 --> 08:14.160
Then that must mean

08:14.243 --> 08:17.705
you've got the blood of
one of those guys in your veins, Johnny.

08:18.414 --> 08:19.540
In my veins?

08:20.124 --> 08:22.293
That's right!
You wouldn't be the real deal otherwise.

08:22.376 --> 08:25.630
If you've really got those powers,
then one of your parents is one.

08:26.589 --> 08:27.507
It sure isn't my mom.

08:27.590 --> 08:28.758
Then…

08:28.841 --> 08:31.010
I've never met my real dad.

08:31.093 --> 08:33.221
-Then that must be it!
-You think so?

08:33.804 --> 08:35.890
Your father must have superpowers.

08:36.849 --> 08:37.892
My dad?

08:38.809 --> 08:40.061
I'm so envious.

08:40.144 --> 08:42.313
My parents are so totally normal.

08:43.105 --> 08:44.774
A real hero?

08:45.358 --> 08:47.860
That's right. I'm sure you can be one too.

08:47.944 --> 08:51.739
Then you can say goodbye
to this town and your home too.

08:52.448 --> 08:53.282
You're right.

08:53.366 --> 08:57.119
Hey, when you become a hero,
let me take your photos.

08:58.120 --> 08:59.622
That would be awesome!

08:59.705 --> 09:01.457
That's The Flare, isn't it?

09:01.541 --> 09:02.375
Janice?

09:03.167 --> 09:05.086
Yeah… That's The Flare.

09:05.753 --> 09:09.257
When I was in Oakland once, I saw him.

09:09.340 --> 09:11.592
Seriously? You saw The Flare?

09:11.676 --> 09:12.635
Awesome!

09:13.219 --> 09:14.971
Yes. He was really cool.

09:15.054 --> 09:18.474
Yeah. Heroes are
the next evolution of humans.

09:19.141 --> 09:21.185
I wish I could meet a hero again.

09:21.269 --> 09:23.563
I'm sure you will. Right?

09:23.646 --> 09:25.648
Yeah. No doubt about it.

09:28.776 --> 09:30.069
Hey, Janice!

09:30.152 --> 09:33.739
-What are you doing over there?
-What? Nothing, Dave!

09:44.458 --> 09:45.626
Let's play.

09:45.710 --> 09:48.879
Astro Boy? This one's so much fun.

09:48.963 --> 09:51.757
But it's okay. I'm broke this month too.

09:51.841 --> 09:52.675
Just play.

09:54.927 --> 09:56.220
Awesome!

09:56.304 --> 09:58.014
You can do this too?

09:58.097 --> 09:59.307
It's on me.

09:59.390 --> 10:00.725
Have fun.

10:00.808 --> 10:02.310
You bet!

10:03.686 --> 10:05.771
-I've been thinking.
-Yeah?

10:06.439 --> 10:08.482
It's probably like you said.

10:10.276 --> 10:14.071
With this power,
I can escape this lame town

10:14.155 --> 10:15.698
and that place I live in.

10:16.699 --> 10:17.825
And that's not all.

10:17.908 --> 10:21.203
You could even get into
The Utopian's Union of Justice.

10:21.787 --> 10:22.997
I could meet the heroes.

10:23.080 --> 10:25.499
Not just meet them.
You could fight alongside them!

10:26.292 --> 10:29.503
Yeah. That's my true calling.

10:32.214 --> 10:34.050
Your power's electricity, right?

10:34.133 --> 10:35.384
Yeah, that's right.

10:35.468 --> 10:38.471
My name will be… Astro… No…

10:39.388 --> 10:40.473
Electro Boy!

10:40.556 --> 10:42.892
Awesome! Electro Boy!

10:43.434 --> 10:45.311
What? You call yourself Erect Boy?

10:46.854 --> 10:48.689
You virgins could never get it up.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.817
You guys stink. Ain't that right, Janice?

10:53.277 --> 10:55.446
Virgins?

10:55.529 --> 10:57.448
Janice, not you too…

10:59.241 --> 11:00.868
Hey! Johnny!

11:03.537 --> 11:04.997
So can you fix it?

11:05.081 --> 11:09.251
You know, it'd be cheaper
if you bought a new one.

11:09.835 --> 11:11.295
In fact, I can't even fix this.

11:11.379 --> 11:13.214
You can't? In that case,

11:13.297 --> 11:16.258
what kind of TV do you suggest?

11:23.391 --> 11:24.308
Welcome home.

11:28.687 --> 11:29.772
Who's my dad?

11:29.855 --> 11:32.274
What? I can't hear you. What is it?

11:35.444 --> 11:36.445
Never mind.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.239
Johnny!

11:38.322 --> 11:39.865
I can't understand him.

11:39.949 --> 11:42.660
Well, you know what puberty is like.

11:44.370 --> 11:46.288
I'll escape this place someday.

11:50.251 --> 11:51.168
I'll become the real deal.

11:57.091 --> 11:59.218
So this is Electro Boy, huh?

11:59.301 --> 12:00.886
Yeah. What do you think?

12:02.430 --> 12:06.225
Say, why don't you let me
help clean up the design?

12:06.308 --> 12:07.143
Please!

12:11.272 --> 12:12.398
Awesome!

12:12.481 --> 12:14.150
You've got a knack for this!

12:14.233 --> 12:16.360
I'm not a fake superhero nerd.

12:16.444 --> 12:18.154
How can I make this into a real outfit?

12:18.237 --> 12:22.616
I think this shirt will be perfect
to build the design on.

12:53.230 --> 12:55.608
Yeah. That's good enough.

12:56.192 --> 12:57.026
All right!

12:57.610 --> 13:00.029
Electro Boy! Here I come!

13:01.822 --> 13:06.285
"To enhance a great power,
one must be mentally tough."

13:06.368 --> 13:07.745
Ip Man said that.

13:07.828 --> 13:09.163
But why kung fu?

13:11.499 --> 13:14.001
When it comes to training,
Jungle Fury is how you do it.

13:14.084 --> 13:16.587
I will be your Pai Zhua master, Johnny.

13:17.171 --> 13:18.088
Power Rangers, right?

13:18.672 --> 13:19.673
Don't underestimate them!

13:19.757 --> 13:23.260
Jungle Fever was indeed based on
Japan's Gekiranger,

13:23.344 --> 13:26.805
but Power Rangers
summoned actual kung fu masters!

13:26.889 --> 13:27.973
Really?

13:28.057 --> 13:30.100
In other words,
they were better than the real ones!

13:30.184 --> 13:33.187
Johnny, let's awaken your spirit!

13:35.481 --> 13:36.565
I'm really going to do this?

13:37.274 --> 13:41.028
It's perfect for letting loose
the power you've stored up inside.

13:41.111 --> 13:42.029
Get ready!

13:53.999 --> 13:55.918
-Boom!
-Here I come!

14:06.720 --> 14:09.306
You know how a maglev train works, right?

14:09.390 --> 14:10.641
Yeah, but…

14:11.225 --> 14:13.644
And you know,
all heroes get around by flying.

14:14.144 --> 14:15.938
You're right. Okay, I'll give it a try.

14:34.039 --> 14:34.874
I'm floating!

14:35.374 --> 14:38.043
Now we just need to find
someone who needs help.

14:38.127 --> 14:40.254
Yeah! Let's find us a crime!

14:57.229 --> 14:58.439
It's so peaceful.

14:58.522 --> 15:00.107
Too darn peaceful.

15:00.190 --> 15:02.401
There's never any crime in this town.

15:02.484 --> 15:06.947
No superhero team has ever
even shown up in this town.

15:08.908 --> 15:11.327
Then we'll have to
make it happen ourselves!

15:13.954 --> 15:17.166
Summer vacation starts tomorrow.
It's the perfect time.

15:17.249 --> 15:18.167
Right.

15:18.250 --> 15:20.377
The final step in my great debut.

15:20.461 --> 15:24.882
Johnny, we're determined
to reveal your superpowers.

15:24.965 --> 15:27.384
With summer vacation coming,
this is our chance.

15:27.468 --> 15:31.639
First, we'll let the kids in this area
know about Electro Boy.

15:32.306 --> 15:34.141
The best place for that is…

15:34.725 --> 15:36.310
The public pool next to the mall.

15:36.393 --> 15:38.896
-It's perfect!
-Yeah!

15:39.730 --> 15:40.981
Janice might even be there.

15:41.065 --> 15:41.941
What?

15:43.275 --> 15:44.360
Never mind.

15:58.415 --> 16:00.834
-This is really good.
-Yes, it is.

16:01.543 --> 16:02.544
Janice!

16:03.629 --> 16:05.297
Oh, if it isn't Johnny.

16:05.381 --> 16:07.383
Hi. How are you doing?

16:07.466 --> 16:10.052
Pretty good. I'm going to the pool now.

16:10.135 --> 16:12.346
Oh, nice. That's great.

16:13.097 --> 16:15.182
Say, remember what you said before?

16:15.766 --> 16:16.725
When?

16:16.809 --> 16:19.019
About wanting to meet a hero.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.271
Did I say that?

16:22.231 --> 16:23.649
You'll meet one soon.

16:23.732 --> 16:26.402
Sorry. I'm going to be late.

16:26.485 --> 16:27.611
See you later, Johnny.

16:28.195 --> 16:29.697
See you later, Janice.

16:31.281 --> 16:33.784
-Hi, lover boy.
-Tom?

16:34.451 --> 16:35.786
Are you ready?

16:36.453 --> 16:38.038
Yeah. You bet.

16:44.878 --> 16:46.797
Leave the filming to me.

16:46.880 --> 16:49.133
I'm counting on you,
my personal cameraman.

16:49.717 --> 16:52.177
I should make my appearance
from above, shouldn't I?

16:52.261 --> 16:54.805
Fly from the mall roof.
Then they'll see you from the pool.

16:54.888 --> 16:55.806
That's perfect!

16:56.390 --> 16:58.267
It's time for the hero to debut!

16:58.350 --> 16:59.935
Here I come!

17:00.019 --> 17:00.894
Awesome!

17:35.345 --> 17:36.305
Okay.

17:40.601 --> 17:41.643
What's that?

17:42.478 --> 17:43.562
It's a hero!

17:43.645 --> 17:45.647
-The Utopian? The Flare?
-What's that?

17:46.231 --> 17:47.900
I've never seen that hero before.

17:52.196 --> 17:53.238
I…

17:54.948 --> 17:56.450
I am Electro Boy!

17:57.201 --> 18:00.412
From now on,
I'll keep this neighborhood safe

18:00.496 --> 18:01.789
and prevent crime!

18:06.168 --> 18:08.587
Wow! That's awesome!

18:09.171 --> 18:11.590
-Awesome!
-That's totally cool!

18:14.968 --> 18:17.054
Isn't that Tom?

18:17.554 --> 18:19.139
Electro Boy?

18:20.307 --> 18:21.642
Hold on here!

18:21.725 --> 18:22.893
Isn't that Johnny Bolt?

18:22.976 --> 18:25.062
-Johnny?
-Seriously?

18:27.397 --> 18:30.359
No! I am Electro Boy!

18:30.442 --> 18:34.446
I'm serious! That guy's Johnny!
He goes to my school!

18:35.030 --> 18:35.948
Johnny?

18:36.031 --> 18:37.199
No!

18:37.825 --> 18:39.076
What a stupid outfit.

18:41.578 --> 18:42.412
What a loser.

18:44.414 --> 18:45.541
No!

18:54.883 --> 18:55.968
Johnny!

20:30.854 --> 20:33.065
He's in bad shape. Let's go.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.360
Hey kid, are you okay?

20:41.114 --> 20:41.949
That hurts!

20:57.839 --> 20:59.424
That sucked.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.594
And I caused it.

21:05.347 --> 21:07.432
But it's not my fault!

21:07.516 --> 21:09.434
Yeah. I know.

21:10.185 --> 21:12.145
But our plan failed.

21:12.771 --> 21:15.232
It turned out like an EC horror comic.

21:15.315 --> 21:18.902
But I've got this amazing power!

21:18.986 --> 21:20.362
If I can't become a real hero,

21:21.280 --> 21:22.531
then what should I do?

21:41.758 --> 21:42.718
Johnny?

21:44.594 --> 21:46.847
Yeah, it was me who did that.

21:48.682 --> 21:50.851
Get a bag. A giant one!

21:51.435 --> 21:52.436
Johnny?

21:52.519 --> 21:55.022
I'm getting out of this place right now.

21:55.105 --> 21:56.565
What are you planning on doing?

21:57.399 --> 22:00.027
I'll become the real deal doing this!

22:16.209 --> 22:17.210
See?

23:42.337 --> 23:47.342
