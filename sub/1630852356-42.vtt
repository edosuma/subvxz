WEBVTT

00:03.545 --> 00:06.112
[whistling]

00:06.156 --> 00:08.506
- Shower up, boys!
- [man] Ow!

00:08.550 --> 00:09.812
Ahh, it's good to be back

00:09.855 --> 00:11.944
at the good ol'
community swimming pool.

00:11.988 --> 00:13.511
The people's pool.

00:13.555 --> 00:15.141
Cricket, you know
you're supposed to shower

00:15.165 --> 00:16.688
before goin' into the pool!

00:16.732 --> 00:20.866
Baloney! Ya get clean
when ya get in the pool!

00:22.041 --> 00:25.610
Ehh! I love me this pool!

00:25.654 --> 00:28.439
- Hey! Ugh!
- [heavy grunting]

00:28.482 --> 00:30.659
- Oh. Hi, Gregly.
- Hey, dummy!

00:30.702 --> 00:32.878
You don't actually <i>
like</i> this pool, do you?!

00:32.922 --> 00:36.882
Uh, yeah? It's the best pool
in Big City.

00:36.926 --> 00:39.711
You sucker!
This place is a wet dump!

00:39.755 --> 00:42.018
If you're lookin'
for a good pool, there's one

00:42.061 --> 00:45.021
in that dumb apartment building
next to your weird old house.

00:45.064 --> 00:47.197
Wait. There's
a better pool than this

00:47.240 --> 00:49.416
next to <i>my</i> weird old house?

00:49.460 --> 00:51.723
Thanks for the tip, Gregly.
I owe ya one.

00:51.767 --> 00:52.724
Hm.

00:52.768 --> 00:53.899
- Family!
- Ugh.

00:53.943 --> 00:55.422
Hey, Cricket!
How's the water?

00:55.466 --> 00:57.642
Inadequate! Listen.

00:57.686 --> 00:59.122
The apartment building
next to us -

00:59.165 --> 01:00.732
next to where we live -

01:00.776 --> 01:03.082
has a better pool
than this pool.

01:03.126 --> 01:05.607
So now we got to leave
this pool and go to that pool.

01:05.650 --> 01:08.305
But Cricket, we don't live
in that apartment building.

01:08.348 --> 01:11.700
So, how can we partake
in its aquatic amenities?

01:11.743 --> 01:14.920
Easy! We sneak in!

01:14.964 --> 01:16.966
It's been too long
since I snuck into a place.

01:17.009 --> 01:19.969
And it's been too long
since I've disrespected

01:20.012 --> 01:22.101
our neighbors. Let's sneak!

01:22.145 --> 01:23.712
[both snicker]

01:23.755 --> 01:25.539
Hmm. Breakin' the rules
runs the risk

01:25.583 --> 01:28.412
of gettin' side-eyed,
and I don't like that.

01:28.455 --> 01:30.980
But I do like
what's goin' on here.

01:31.023 --> 01:32.895
[both snickering]

01:32.938 --> 01:35.724
Well, I don't like it.
Come on, guys,

01:35.767 --> 01:37.943
this pool is fine!
And frankly, I don't approve

01:37.987 --> 01:40.380
of my family trespassin'
on private property!

01:40.424 --> 01:41.730
Too bad, I'm going!

01:41.773 --> 01:43.732
Yeah! Hey, can I go
through here, too?

01:43.775 --> 01:45.385
- Later, Bill!
- Sorry, Papa.

01:45.429 --> 01:46.822
But I'm goin' with the flow.

01:46.865 --> 01:49.520
But you're all gonna miss
Aquarobics!

01:49.563 --> 01:51.783
Well, more Aquarobics
for me, I guess.

01:51.827 --> 01:53.524
[Cricket]
I still can't believe it.

01:53.567 --> 01:56.266
Behind those doors
lies a superior swimming pool,

01:56.309 --> 01:57.789
unbeknownst to me!

01:57.833 --> 01:59.835
We're gonna need a plan,
and a good one.

01:59.878 --> 02:00.836
Tilly, whatcha got?

02:00.879 --> 02:02.228
Tilly has left.

02:02.272 --> 02:04.970
My name is now...
"A. Resident."

02:05.014 --> 02:06.493
I live in that
apartment building,

02:06.537 --> 02:09.148
and I am 26 years old!

02:09.192 --> 02:11.977
I love it, but...
what about the rest of us?

02:12.021 --> 02:14.066
Hey, Greens! You guys
look ready to swim!

02:14.110 --> 02:15.285
You wanna use our pool?

02:15.328 --> 02:16.416
No, thank you...

02:16.460 --> 02:17.766
Yup! We'd love to!

02:17.809 --> 02:18.984
- Mmm!
- Hey!

02:20.986 --> 02:23.206
Ahh, my family doesn't know
what they're missin'.

02:23.249 --> 02:25.338
Emergency! Emergency!

02:25.382 --> 02:27.645
There's a child in the water,

02:27.689 --> 02:29.995
and his safety floaties
sprung a leak!

02:30.039 --> 02:33.651
So now he's drifting
towards the deep end!

02:33.695 --> 02:34.913
If only there were someone

02:34.957 --> 02:37.220
at this pool
who knew how to swim!

02:37.263 --> 02:41.224
Yeah, if only there...
Wait! I can swim!

02:42.529 --> 02:45.489
I wivved my wife
wif no we-gwets...

02:45.532 --> 02:47.621
[both exclaim]

02:47.665 --> 02:49.406
[screaming, grunts]

02:49.449 --> 02:50.842
He saved me!

02:50.886 --> 02:52.278
[all cheering]

02:52.322 --> 02:54.150
Wow! That guy's a hero!

02:54.193 --> 02:55.847
[all cheering]

02:55.891 --> 02:57.414
[girl]
He totally saved that kid!

02:57.457 --> 02:58.676
Gifts for the hero!

02:58.720 --> 03:00.243
Wait, gifts?

03:00.286 --> 03:02.419
Are y'all just givin' me
this floatie raft?

03:02.462 --> 03:04.116
Sir, you've done enough today.

03:04.160 --> 03:06.771
Now, will you allow us
to shower you with gifts?

03:06.815 --> 03:09.905
Oh, well... [chuckles]
That sounds pretty good!

03:11.254 --> 03:12.777
All right, Greens,
here's the pool!

03:12.821 --> 03:14.823
- [all gasping]
- Holy beans 'n brisket!

03:14.866 --> 03:16.955
This pool is amazing!

03:19.001 --> 03:20.500
And the water doesn't
taste like bleach.

03:20.524 --> 03:21.917
It's liquid paradise!

03:21.960 --> 03:24.746
[both panting]
Cannonball!

03:24.789 --> 03:27.009
- Yah!
- Easiest break-in ever!

03:27.052 --> 03:28.967
I gotta hand it to you,
neighbor boy.

03:29.011 --> 03:31.927
This new pool is much better
than the community pool.

03:31.970 --> 03:34.016
And it even brought Mama
and Gramma together.

03:34.059 --> 03:35.887
- [coughing]
- [Brett] Hey, fancy hat!

03:35.931 --> 03:37.671
What you standin' 'round
gabbin' for?

03:37.715 --> 03:38.847
Get in the pool!

03:39.935 --> 03:41.937
Well, when the pool beckons...

03:41.980 --> 03:43.677
Whoo-hoo!

03:43.721 --> 03:46.550
Now, this is the best pool
in Big City! Aah!

03:46.593 --> 03:48.247
You dummy. The best pool
in Big City's

03:48.291 --> 03:50.510
- at the Spritz Hotel.
- Huh?

03:50.554 --> 03:52.861
Supposedly, they got
two water slides.

03:52.904 --> 03:55.056
- Ahhh...
- [Brett] And butlers
that deliver room service

03:55.080 --> 03:56.821
to your pool raft!

03:56.865 --> 03:59.781
Hey, guys, great news!
You gotta get out of the pool!

03:59.824 --> 04:03.393
What? But my wrinkles were
just startin' to get pruny!

04:03.436 --> 04:05.090
Might I remind you
we're on a mission

04:05.134 --> 04:07.092
to find the best pool
in Big City?

04:07.136 --> 04:08.746
Well, I found it.
You're welcome.

04:08.790 --> 04:10.443
It's at the Spritz Hotel.
Let's go.

04:10.487 --> 04:12.968
This might not be
the greatest idea.

04:13.011 --> 04:15.405
Sneakin' into a luxury hotel
is no joke.

04:15.448 --> 04:16.808
Well, Mother,
if you're too scared,

04:16.841 --> 04:18.930
that's fine.
But I bet Gramma ain't.

04:18.974 --> 04:20.845
'Course, I ain't scared.

04:20.889 --> 04:23.543
It's Nancy who don't
got the pork chops to do it.

04:23.587 --> 04:26.155
Oh, I have <i>plenty</i> of pork chops!

04:26.198 --> 04:27.852
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!

04:27.896 --> 04:28.897
- Yeah?!
- Yeah!

04:28.940 --> 04:30.202
[both]
We're goin'!

04:31.943 --> 04:34.337
Cricket, I liked it better
when Gramma and Mama

04:34.380 --> 04:35.991
weren't fightin'.
We were all havin' fun

04:36.034 --> 04:38.776
at this pool.
Let's just stay here.

04:38.820 --> 04:40.909
Oh, come on, Till,
haven't you heard the saying?

04:40.952 --> 04:43.650
"The grass is always greener
on the other side!"

04:43.694 --> 04:45.130
Now, let's go get
that green grass!

04:45.174 --> 04:47.219
I don't think that means
what you think it means!

04:47.263 --> 04:49.656
Heh, thanks for your
treatin' me so good.

04:49.700 --> 04:51.006
Anything for a hero!

04:51.049 --> 04:52.746
I made a present
for you, Mr. Green!

04:52.790 --> 04:54.183
Thanks. I'll open it later.

04:54.226 --> 04:55.619
Another beverage, Mr. Green?

04:55.662 --> 04:56.794
[chuckles] Why not!

04:56.838 --> 04:58.143
Excuse me, Mr. Green,

04:58.187 --> 05:00.450
can <i>I</i> get anything for you?

05:00.493 --> 05:03.018
Oh, no, I think
I'm about topped up here.

05:03.061 --> 05:05.237
How about my...
phone number?

05:05.281 --> 05:06.195
[gasps]

05:06.238 --> 05:08.240
[giggling]

05:11.026 --> 05:13.637
All right, crew,
our target's in there.

05:13.680 --> 05:15.465
The best pool in Big City!

05:15.508 --> 05:16.988
Who you goin' as
this time, Tilly?

05:17.032 --> 05:19.773
I am a blushin' bride
on her weddin' day,

05:19.817 --> 05:23.821
veiled and beautiful.
I am a guest at this hotel,

05:23.865 --> 05:26.868
and my name is...
"A. Guest."

05:26.911 --> 05:29.218
- Mm... OK!
- OK, listen up.

05:29.261 --> 05:31.698
The two secrets to
sneakin' into a fancy hotel

05:31.742 --> 05:34.440
are to walk fast
and project confidence!

05:34.484 --> 05:36.007
I've been doin'
both those things

05:36.051 --> 05:39.706
since before you could spit!
Let's boogie!

05:39.750 --> 05:40.751
[elevator bell dings]

05:43.667 --> 05:44.929
Hm.

05:47.192 --> 05:48.672
[bell dings]

05:48.715 --> 05:50.892
Ahh, we fooled her!

05:50.935 --> 05:53.459
- Next stop: luxury.
- [beeping]

05:53.503 --> 05:55.853
Uh-oh. It won't work
without a keycard.

05:55.897 --> 05:57.072
Let me try somethin'.

05:57.115 --> 05:58.116
Ahh...

05:59.335 --> 06:01.337
[groaning]

06:03.948 --> 06:04.949
[beeping]

06:04.993 --> 06:06.951
Ugh. OK, Plan B.

06:06.995 --> 06:07.996
[bell dings]

06:08.910 --> 06:10.607
Mm...

06:10.650 --> 06:12.478
Heck, yeah!
That's our ticket!

06:12.522 --> 06:14.393
The hotel ventilation system!

06:14.437 --> 06:16.091
Oh, Cricket,
that only works in...

06:16.134 --> 06:19.964
Spy movies and heist movies,
exactly. Boost, please!

06:20.008 --> 06:21.966
Oh, yeah, this is great.

06:22.010 --> 06:23.141
[Tilly]
Is it roomy?

06:23.185 --> 06:25.100
It's... room-ish.

06:25.143 --> 06:26.623
[squeaking]

06:26.666 --> 06:28.122
Hey, I just saw a mouse
eatin' one of those

06:28.146 --> 06:30.714
little hotel soaps.
That's fun, right?

06:30.757 --> 06:33.499
Oh! This plan
is bad, Cricket.

06:33.543 --> 06:36.589
Yeah, I didn't sign up
to have Nancy's cloppers

06:36.633 --> 06:38.940
swingin' around in my face.

06:38.983 --> 06:40.898
Maybe we should have
stayed with Papa

06:40.942 --> 06:43.161
- at the first pool.
- Are you nuts?

06:43.205 --> 06:46.512
We're on our way to
the greatest pool in Big City!

06:46.556 --> 06:48.340
Now, brace yourselves.
Pool's on the roof,

06:48.384 --> 06:51.169
and we've got a 19-story
vertical crawl ahead of us.

06:51.213 --> 06:53.171
- [groans]
- Mah!

06:53.215 --> 06:55.913
[Cricket] Dad wishes
he was us right now!

06:55.957 --> 06:57.610
He's gonna do it!

06:57.654 --> 07:00.744
[slurping to the tune of
"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"]

07:04.530 --> 07:06.141
[all cheering]

07:06.184 --> 07:08.882
[Gramma] I'm inhalin'
too much mouse dust!

07:08.926 --> 07:10.841
[Cricket] Don't worry,
I think I see the top.

07:10.884 --> 07:12.147
[all exclaim, groan]

07:13.931 --> 07:16.890
[gasps] Oh, my gosh!

07:16.934 --> 07:21.156
We found it!
The best pool in Big City!

07:21.199 --> 07:24.811
Ha-ha! Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

07:24.855 --> 07:26.988
- Gotcha!
- Hey, come on!

07:27.031 --> 07:30.469
You all are in violation
of hotel law, subsection pool.

07:30.513 --> 07:32.036
Sneaking into pools
is right up there

07:32.080 --> 07:34.908
with getting in the water
without showering first.

07:34.952 --> 07:39.870
Seriously?! Ya get clean
when ya go <i>in the pool!</i>

07:39.913 --> 07:43.004
Yeah. All of you
are under hotel arrest.

07:43.047 --> 07:44.266
Gosh dangit!

07:44.309 --> 07:46.790
Uh, you wouldn't arrest
a beautiful bride

07:46.833 --> 07:48.574
on her weddin' day, would you?

07:48.618 --> 07:49.967
[growls]

07:50.011 --> 07:51.969
Oh, dear.
I'm gettin' side-eyed.

07:52.013 --> 07:54.015
My worst fears
have come to life.

07:54.058 --> 07:55.886
[Concierge] Now, stay put
until I figure out

07:55.929 --> 07:56.930
what to do with you!

07:56.974 --> 07:58.541
Wait, wait, wait!
Let us out!

07:58.584 --> 08:00.673
We just wanted to swim!

08:00.717 --> 08:03.067
Come on, kiddo.
I think we gotta give it up.

08:03.111 --> 08:06.723
What?! We can't stop now!
Uh... Look! Another air vent!

08:06.766 --> 08:07.874
We can crawl through it again

08:07.898 --> 08:09.093
and get right back up
to the pool!

08:09.117 --> 08:10.268
- [squeaks]
- [Tilly] Oh, hey!

08:10.292 --> 08:12.033
There's that mouse again!

08:12.076 --> 08:14.209
[retches]

08:14.252 --> 08:16.907
- Oh, my.
- Yep, there's no way
I'm doin' that again.

08:16.950 --> 08:19.301
[groans] Come on, Mom!
We can do it!

08:19.344 --> 08:21.651
Cricket, I think we've all
been through enough today.

08:21.694 --> 08:23.914
We spent so much time
runnin' around,

08:23.957 --> 08:26.830
we barely got to have
any pool-time fun.

08:26.873 --> 08:30.877
Dangit, you may have a point.
Here we are bone dry

08:30.921 --> 08:33.054
all because I kept on wantin'
something better!

08:33.097 --> 08:38.102
I lost track of enjoyin'...
what's in front of ya!

08:38.146 --> 08:40.409
[all clamoring]

08:40.452 --> 08:43.281
Gee, y'all just keep
givin' me beverages, heh.

08:43.325 --> 08:45.675
Uh, Mr. Green,
the child you saved

08:45.718 --> 08:47.416
would like to give you
an offering!

08:47.459 --> 08:52.290
To my hewo, a dwink
as big as his bwavewy!

08:52.334 --> 08:53.552
Oh, well, I don't know

08:53.596 --> 08:55.119
if I have the room
for such a big...

08:55.163 --> 08:57.295
OK, I guess he's goin'
right there, huh?

08:57.339 --> 08:58.644
[bubbling]

08:58.688 --> 09:00.516
That big soda is so heavy,

09:00.559 --> 09:02.648
it's causing the raft to sink!

09:02.692 --> 09:05.129
Quick, mister,
you gotta do something!

09:05.173 --> 09:06.913
Now, hang on a minute, I can...

09:06.957 --> 09:09.525
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no!
Come on! [groans]

09:09.568 --> 09:13.268
He's in trouble!
But who heroes the hero?!

09:13.311 --> 09:15.400
Hello. Does somebody
need assistance?

09:15.444 --> 09:17.750
It's Mark, the local hero!

09:17.794 --> 09:19.883
We've seen him once before!

09:19.926 --> 09:22.320
- Somebody's gonna save us!
- No.

09:22.364 --> 09:24.081
- [all cheering]
- Never fear, Mark is here!

09:24.105 --> 09:27.195
No, don't come! Wait, no!
There's been a mistake.

09:27.238 --> 09:28.935
I'm just trapped
under these cups.

09:28.979 --> 09:30.459
I swam earlier, remember?
I can...

09:30.502 --> 09:31.721
Oh, we're on land now.

09:31.764 --> 09:34.898
- [all cheering]
- You're my hewo!

09:34.941 --> 09:36.354
- [Bill] Seriously?!
- [Mark] Oh, little bud.

09:36.378 --> 09:38.858
I'm just an ordinary guy
doing what's right!

09:38.902 --> 09:41.774
[all clamoring]

09:41.818 --> 09:44.560
I'm... just gonna
grab my number back.

09:44.603 --> 09:46.779
Yoo-hoo! Mr. Hero!

09:46.823 --> 09:49.086
Well, Bill, you're still
a hero to me.

09:49.130 --> 09:51.654
You really mean that, Bill?
Yep, I do, Bill.

09:51.697 --> 09:53.264
Now, what do you say we go home?

09:53.308 --> 09:54.918
Sounds good, Bill.

09:54.961 --> 09:57.225
All right, you pool rats,
listen up!

09:57.268 --> 09:59.923
- What the...?
- [all laughing]

09:59.966 --> 10:02.882
What in the name of chlorine
is goin' on here?!

10:02.926 --> 10:06.277
We made this place a pool!

10:06.321 --> 10:08.801
You guys made a pool
out of a laundry closet?

10:08.845 --> 10:10.847
Care to join us?

10:10.890 --> 10:13.284
Well, actually,
I'm just here to tell you,

10:13.328 --> 10:15.168
turns out, upper management
doesn't really care

10:15.199 --> 10:18.985
about International Pool Law,
so you guys are free to go.

10:19.029 --> 10:21.336
Oh, well, that's good and all,
but I'd rather stay here

10:21.379 --> 10:23.773
and have fun with my family.
If that's OK.

10:23.816 --> 10:25.731
Yeah, whatever.

10:25.775 --> 10:27.603
[all]
Best pool day ever!

10:27.646 --> 10:29.779
[all squeaking]

10:29.822 --> 10:30.997
Maybe we should leave.
