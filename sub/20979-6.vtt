Which hunting rock better?

00:55.681 --> 00:58.809
Uh, well, it depends.
Are you looking to bludgeon or pummel?

[Ugga] Grug, little help!

01:02.896 --> 01:04.480
[exertion panting]

01:05.691 --> 01:07.150
Help me test these for poisons.

01:07.234 --> 01:08.954
We lost another taster
at Gatherer's Garden,

01:09.027 --> 01:10.696
and need all tongues on deck.

01:10.779 --> 01:12.823
Sure, hon. Just let me warm up.

01:12.906 --> 01:14.157

[Pram] Oh, Grug!

I know you're angry at him, Pram,

Grug! Grug!

01:28.005 --> 01:30.590
[Ugga] Hey! Help, Grug!

01:37.931 --> 01:40.600
Too many problems, too much walking,
not enough Grug.

01:40.684 --> 01:41.935
I need more Grug.

01:42.019 --> 01:45.147
But all you do is lie there all flat,
Shadow Grug.

01:45.230 --> 01:47.566
[as Shadow Grug]
What if you got a better shadow?

01:47.649 --> 01:50.485
Hmm. Interesting idea. Go on.

01:50.569 --> 01:52.571
Dad, are you okay?

01:52.654 --> 01:57.242
Eep, please don't interrupt Shadow Grug.
Yeah, you're right.

01:57.326 --> 01:58.910
Eep would be a great shadow.

02:00.871 --> 02:04.833
So while I was totally out of my gourd
berry earlier, I had a genius

02:04.916 --> 02:07.252
idea on how we can all
get the help we need.

02:07.336 --> 02:09.338
It's called shadowing, okay?

02:09.420 --> 02:13.133
Every kid follows an adult's shadow
and learns to help with his or her job.

02:13.216 --> 02:15.010
Uh, point of order?

02:15.093 --> 02:18.096
What if your job is
becoming one with all there is?

02:18.180 --> 02:21.266
What if your boss is the wind?

02:21.350 --> 02:25.687
Uh, I guess you just do that then.
Eep, you'll be my shadow.

02:25.771 --> 02:27.939
Yes! Shadowing the leader.

02:28.023 --> 02:31.026
[giggles] So I'm basically
like your second-in-command?

02:31.109 --> 02:33.195
Sure.
Now, Bulk, you shadow

02:33.278 --> 02:35.489
Amber. Womp, uh,
you'll be with Old Man Root.

02:35.572 --> 02:38.659
Oh, Womp's allergic to body hair.

02:38.742 --> 02:39.660
[sneezes]

02:39.743 --> 02:42.496
No put Amber daughter
with bush person.

02:42.579 --> 02:44.623
I also object to that guy.

02:44.706 --> 02:46.750
Okay, okay! Everybody calm down.

02:46.833 --> 02:50.212
We’ll just make a few swaps.
You move here, and you over here.

02:50.295 --> 02:53.382
Better? Hope so, 'cause I'm not pausing
for feedback, so, bye!

02:53.465 --> 02:54.883
Aah! Wait!

02:54.966 --> 02:57.677
I'm not gonna learn anything
from Old Man Root.

03:00.013 --> 03:03.642
Sorry, Eep, but I can't make someone
else's kid spend time with that nutball.

03:03.725 --> 03:05.394
I mean, who knows,
he could be dangerous.

03:05.477 --> 03:06.561
'Kay? So have fun!

03:06.645 --> 03:08.230
Now, who did I end up with?

03:08.313 --> 03:10.107
Paired with the big dog.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.400
Woof, woof. Yeah.

03:11.483 --> 03:13.026
Oh, no.

03:13.110 --> 03:14.194
I didn't!

03:14.277 --> 03:19.574
Can't wait to help out my valley leader,
and ask him a few questions about Eep.

03:19.658 --> 03:21.952
[chuckles] Just kidding.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.954
I got way more than a few.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.205
What's her favorite animal?

03:25.288 --> 03:27.040
How many breaths does she take in a day?

03:27.124 --> 03:29.668
If she were a bird, would she be my bird?

03:30.293 --> 03:33.755
Mmm. Oh.

03:33.839 --> 03:35.632
There. Did you hear it?

03:35.716 --> 03:38.802
For the tenth time, hear what?

03:38.885 --> 03:45.434
To tell you would ruin the mystery.
We all come from where? Oh, wow!

03:45.517 --> 03:50.897
Ugh! Can't you just teach me
something useful, like how to hunt?

03:50.981 --> 03:56.528
Amber teaching style hands-on.
So keep hands on rock, 'cause Amber throw.

03:56.611 --> 03:58.155
I'm a rock.

03:59.156 --> 04:01.616
Now that's teaching.

04:01.700 --> 04:05.245
Oh, I can teach you about
buffalippo... droppings.

04:06.496 --> 04:08.707
[sniffs] Mmm.

04:08.790 --> 04:11.668
Wheat grass
with just a hint of rotted fruit.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.920
[chuckles] This guy's a foodie.

04:14.004 --> 04:16.380
Ugh! You wildly misunderstood me.

04:16.464 --> 04:19.301
What about gathering? Hmm?

04:20.051 --> 04:23.180
Make sure you check the fruit for worms.
They're much better on their own.

04:23.263 --> 04:26.141
Worms aren't for eatin',
they're for friendin'.

04:26.224 --> 04:28.059
[chuckles]
Aren't they, Marvin?

04:30.187 --> 04:33.315
See, worms seem quiet,
but up close, they sound like...

04:33.398 --> 04:37.068
- [snorting]
- [sighing]

04:37.152 --> 04:42.324
Now, the key to babysitting is,
whatever they do, just keep sitting.

04:42.407 --> 04:44.367
They may be babies, but they're sneaky.

04:44.451 --> 04:46.369
I'm on to you.

04:46.453 --> 04:49.039
Gotcha.
Not easy to ignore my sister, but

04:49.122 --> 04:50.683
I'm starting to get the hang of...
[gasps]

04:50.707 --> 04:52.793
Butt cramp! Butt cramp!
[audibly straining]

04:53.919 --> 04:57.130
No. Never let the baby
get the upper butt.

04:57.214 --> 05:00.550
Oh, man. Everyone is
learning something but me.

05:00.634 --> 05:01.843
Even Thunk.

05:01.927 --> 05:04.971
[gasps] I'm jealous of Thunk!

05:05.055 --> 05:09.017

which is also not a singing zone,

05:33.625 --> 05:37.087

and focus on work, okay?

but I get a lot out of it, too.

06:31.349 --> 06:33.351
Eep, what is Lerk's deal?

06:33.435 --> 06:36.146
She is so happy.
What is wrong with her?

06:44.446 --> 06:47.866
[chuckles] Yeah, Lerk's really positive.

06:47.949 --> 06:50.619
Once, a spider ant laid eggs
in her ear, and she said,

06:50.702 --> 06:53.079
"Thanks for the new friends."

06:53.163 --> 06:57.417
You know, she's the one
who should be paired with Old Man Root.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.794
They both got a weird thing for worms.

06:59.878 --> 07:03.757
Oh, is that so?
Eep, I have an idea.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.508

on the "nitting" club.

11:50.835 --> 11:51.711
Relax.

11:51.794 --> 11:54.672
All you do in "nitting" club
is pick each other's nits.

11:54.756 --> 11:57.508
And it's really just an excuse to gab.

11:57.592 --> 12:01.387
[soft chuckle] So say something
interesting and you'll be fine. Got it?

12:01.471 --> 12:04.349
So, [nervous chuckle] ahem,

12:04.432 --> 12:06.809
all you really need to know about me is,

12:06.893 --> 12:10.313
um, yeah, I'm really interesting,
you know,

12:10.396 --> 12:15.818
because I have so many interests
and they are all interesting.

12:15.902 --> 12:18.196
[yawns] Sounds fascinating.

12:18.279 --> 12:22.450
Can you name one of those,
ahem, interests?

12:22.533 --> 12:26.329
Um, I, uh... I like, uh...

12:27.747 --> 12:30.083
smash fruit, in moderate amounts.
[light chuckle]

12:30.166 --> 12:32.210
Might wanna go easy there, Pram.

12:32.293 --> 12:34.796
- Hmph!
- See? I'm interesting.

12:39.258 --> 12:44.347
Ooh, did I tell you about my night out
clubbing with Bow Chicka Wow Wow?

12:44.430 --> 12:46.474
[chuckle] We clubbed so many prey.

12:46.557 --> 12:48.351
I love clubbing, too.
I club chickuna,

12:48.434 --> 12:52.772
I club pig rat, pretty much every
interesting thing out there.

12:52.855 --> 12:54.148
I'm just clubbin' it.

12:55.233 --> 12:59.112
You sure are good at killing things.
Animals, conversations.

12:59.195 --> 13:02.657
Ugga, would you move a bit?

13:03.199 --> 13:04.617
Bit more.

13:06.703 --> 13:08.037
[Pram] Almost there.

13:09.163 --> 13:10.748
[screaming]

13:10.832 --> 13:12.000
[grunting]

13:12.083 --> 13:14.419
"Nitting" club tough crowd, eh?

13:14.502 --> 13:17.463
Uh, no, no. I wasn't, uh...

13:17.547 --> 13:21.009
Ugh. Amber know that pain.
Low branch not so bad.

13:21.092 --> 13:26.222
Give Amber alone space to watch sunset,
admire that day's dying sun, and, uh...

13:27.849 --> 13:29.642
[sobbing]
have a good cry.

13:33.438 --> 13:36.190
Ugga wanna cry with Amber?

13:36.274 --> 13:39.819
[Ugga] I didn't know what to say,
so I just gave a bad excuse and left.

13:39.902 --> 13:42.405
- Really? What'd you say?
- Nothing.

13:42.488 --> 13:45.533
I actually shouted the word...
"Excuse!" ...and ran.

13:45.616 --> 13:49.078
[sighs] I don't get it.
Why did the "nitting" club force me out?

13:49.162 --> 13:53.750
Simple! You're boring! It's okay.
We've all got something.

13:53.833 --> 13:56.335
Grug's got the face of a bear owl's butt,

13:56.419 --> 13:58.046
I'm too gorgeous,

14:00.048 --> 14:02.967
Thunk's got that buzztle nest
stuck on his head.

14:03.051 --> 14:04.844
[sighs] The harder I pull,

14:04.927 --> 14:07.055
[grunting] the tighter it gets.

14:07.138 --> 14:08.890
Ugga, you're not boring.

14:08.973 --> 14:11.017
Who cares what some
"nitting" club thinks?

14:11.100 --> 14:13.728
I do. I need other people to talk to,

14:13.811 --> 14:16.731
since now you're spending
so much time leading the valley.

14:16.814 --> 14:19.359
I'm sorry. I know you guys need me here,

14:19.442 --> 14:22.070
but see, everyone in town keeps
turning to me with their problems.

14:22.153 --> 14:25.281
Oh, that reminds me, I gotta help
Old Man Root cure his gross red rash.

14:25.365 --> 14:26.574
[screams]

14:26.657 --> 14:29.285
He showed me things I will never unsee.

14:29.369 --> 14:33.664
Ooh! Oh, yeah,
I shouldn't say that too loud.

14:33.748 --> 14:35.708
Old Rootsie wouldn't really
want anyone to know.

14:35.792 --> 14:38.169
Uh, but I'm sure you'll be fine.
Just be yourself.

14:38.795 --> 14:40.463
Ha! Be yourself?

14:40.546 --> 14:42.882
Has he met ya? Spice it up.

14:44.801 --> 14:46.969
So, I wanna apologize for yesterday

14:47.053 --> 14:51.933
and let you know my life's actually
really, really spicy.

14:52.016 --> 14:55.478
Like, a lot.
Like this jalapeñeapple.

14:57.021 --> 14:58.314
[pained gasp]

14:58.398 --> 15:01.109
Even the sweat burns.

15:01.192 --> 15:04.153
[yawns] Be a dear and sweat
your way over there.

15:05.113 --> 15:07.323
- A little more.
- Keep going.

15:07.407 --> 15:12.036
Ugh! Why are you treating me like
Old Man Root and his disgusting rash?

15:12.120 --> 15:18.292
Mm-hmm. Well, well, I do believe
this smash fruit just got juicy.

15:18.376 --> 15:19.752
Do tell.

15:19.836 --> 15:23.673
Um, the rash is red.

15:23.756 --> 15:27.718
And it's everywhere.

15:27.802 --> 15:29.262
[laughing]

15:30.721 --> 15:33.599
Uh, yeah, yeah, I hear all sorts of
interesting stuff from my husband,

15:33.683 --> 15:34.809
now that he's the leader.

15:34.892 --> 15:37.603
Like... did you hear how Munk
fell for Teena?

15:46.529 --> 15:50.283
And he was, like...
[imitating Munk] "Sorry, beautiful lady."

15:50.366 --> 15:51.826
[Ugga] And she was, like...

15:51.909 --> 15:53.703
[imitating Teena]
"My pelt is soaked! Aah!"

15:55.705 --> 15:56.705
[groaning]

15:59.208 --> 16:02.712
[imitating Munk] "Heh, you have pretty...
[spits] eyes."

16:04.046 --> 16:07.633
[Ugga] Then she buried Munk's legs
under a crazy heavy boulder.

16:08.843 --> 16:12.430
Now Grug has to carry him everywhere
he wants to go.

16:12.513 --> 16:13.764
Teena's still at large.

16:13.848 --> 16:16.350
I knew there was a reason
why I excluded her.

16:16.434 --> 16:17.310
[excited chatter]

16:17.393 --> 16:21.397
Now that's some good dirt, Ugga.
Here, let me get this for you.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.149
No, let me nitpick.

16:23.232 --> 16:24.734
I call dibs on her lice.

16:24.817 --> 16:29.780
Guys, guys, my scalp is crawling
with enough bugs to go around.

16:31.365 --> 16:34.702
Grug, honey. How was your day?

16:34.785 --> 16:36.825
Full of juicy,
embarrassing new stories, I'm hoping.

16:36.871 --> 16:38.456
I'm, uh, guessing.

16:38.539 --> 16:40.666
Well, this valley's problems
are overwhelming,

16:40.750 --> 16:43.920
even for a truly, truly
great leader like me.

16:44.003 --> 16:49.425
Aw, why don't you tell me all about them,
so I can, uh, help... you.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.219
[Thunk]
That is so thoughtful of you, Mom.

16:51.302 --> 16:54.180
- [buzzing]
- [grunting, sighing]

16:56.349 --> 16:59.977
Yep, I got only good intentions.
Now start dishing.

17:00.061 --> 17:02.480
Okay, well, first, there's Baitsy.

17:02.563 --> 17:06.233
Apparently, he wanted rock-hard abs,
so guess what he did.

17:10.780 --> 17:12.114
[Ugga] And then he was, like...

17:12.198 --> 17:14.117
[as Baitsy]
"You have to suffer to be beautiful."

17:15.742 --> 17:18.454
That is the funniest thing
I'll ever hear in my life.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.248
Unless you've got something better?

17:20.330 --> 17:22.666
Oh, I am just getting started.

17:22.750 --> 17:25.670
I heard Marm snuck off
Old People Island.

17:25.752 --> 17:26.878
[Ugga] Marm was all, like,

17:26.963 --> 17:31.759
[imitating Marm] "See, I'm still young.
Don't abandon me with those geezers.

17:31.842 --> 17:33.844
[lizvult screeching]

17:33.928 --> 17:37.848
Come on, man, be cool. Take him!"

17:38.558 --> 17:40.685
[imitating Womp]
"I'm Womp."

17:40.768 --> 17:42.353
[laughter]

17:42.436 --> 17:44.146
Wait. I've got an even better one.

17:44.230 --> 17:47.358
You know Bud and Crud, those guys
totally obsessed with eggs?

17:47.441 --> 17:52.321
Well, Crud comes home to discover
his brother likes eggs a little too much.

17:52.405 --> 17:53.882
[imitating Bud]
"I'm an ooey-gooey goopy eggie!

17:53.906 --> 17:56.242
Ahh! Don't come in!"

17:56.325 --> 18:00.246
[Ugga] Crud and Grug had to confront
Bud about his issues,

18:00.329 --> 18:03.874
but he freaked out and hid
in a lizvult's nest.

18:03.958 --> 18:06.085
[imitating Womp] "I'm Womp."

18:06.168 --> 18:07.587
[laughter]

18:07.670 --> 18:11.924
You're the queen of telling stories
about people behind their backs.

18:12.008 --> 18:13.968
You make your mother proud.

18:14.051 --> 18:16.220
So what else have you got?

18:16.304 --> 18:21.684
Oh, wait till you hear about Baitsy
and his rock-hard abs.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.102
Heard it. Next.

18:23.185 --> 18:27.023
Oh. Hey, why doesn't
somebody else go? Gran?

18:27.106 --> 18:30.860
Oh, I'm not about to follow that.
You got more stories or not?

18:30.943 --> 18:32.737
[nervous laughing]

18:35.114 --> 18:36.907
Grug, honey! How was your...

18:36.991 --> 18:39.243
[gasps] What happened?

18:39.327 --> 18:41.495
[sigh] Old Man Root happened.

18:41.579 --> 18:45.875
I went to help him with his rash,
but he was not happy to see me.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.084
[Grug] He was all, like,

18:47.168 --> 18:48.968
[imitating root]
"Grug, you're a great leader.

18:49.003 --> 18:50.671
Some might say the best leader.

18:50.755 --> 18:53.299
But why did you tell everyone
about my rash?"

18:53.382 --> 18:54.967
Then I was, like,
"What do you mean?"

18:55.051 --> 18:56.677
No, wait, I said it more like this,

18:56.761 --> 18:58.095
[calmly]
"What do you mean?"

19:00.222 --> 19:01.932
[pained groan]

19:02.016 --> 19:04.518
Oh, that is awful.

19:05.144 --> 19:10.399
So, um, how did his rash look, exactly?

19:10.483 --> 19:13.069
Ugga, the only person I told
about Root was you.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.488
What exactly have you been
doing at "nitting" club?

19:15.571 --> 19:19.825
Nothing. I just, ya know,
go sip some smash fruit.

19:19.909 --> 19:22.745
Oh, is that what you're calling it?
"Go-sip"?

19:22.828 --> 19:25.748
Ugga, you can't share secrets
about other people like that.

19:25.831 --> 19:29.710
Okay, I'll stop. And I'm sorry
if what I said got you hurt.

19:30.294 --> 19:33.756
Uh, unrelated, you got any problems
you wanna talk about?

19:33.839 --> 19:36.592
- The funnier the better.
- [growls]

19:36.676 --> 19:38.511
[Thunk]
You could share secrets about me.

19:38.594 --> 19:41.013
Huh. A goofy kid with a nest on his head.

19:41.097 --> 19:42.532
[imitating Thunk] "I can do the voice."

19:42.556 --> 19:44.475
Nah. That's not gonna cut it.

19:44.558 --> 19:47.561
Please. I like it when people
talk about me. [grunting]

19:48.479 --> 19:51.482
[sighs] There's gotta be good dirt
to share around here somewhere.

19:51.565 --> 19:53.025
Oh, but all I see are rocks,

19:53.109 --> 19:56.821
and not even rocks with secrets.
[groaning]

19:56.904 --> 19:59.198
[sighs] Want sit with Amber?

19:59.281 --> 20:00.950
Sunset start soon.

20:01.033 --> 20:05.955
Perfect time to... cry and get
all emotion out of nose.

20:06.038 --> 20:09.166
In form of snot.
[crying]

20:09.917 --> 20:13.212
Come on.
It be our little secret.

20:13.295 --> 20:14.922
Secret...

20:16.549 --> 20:19.135
Uh, sorry.
Uh, "nitting" club's waiting for me.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.178
- I gotta go, bye.
- [sobbing]

20:22.304 --> 20:23.304
There she is.

20:23.347 --> 20:25.808
Give us some dirt,
Ugga, and make it juicy.

20:25.891 --> 20:27.101
Basically, we want mud.

20:27.184 --> 20:31.063
Ooh, I got some muddy mud for you!

20:31.147 --> 20:32.440
You all know Amber, right?

20:32.523 --> 20:35.818
- [Amber crying]
- Well, I just saw her, and she said,

20:35.901 --> 20:37.486
[imitating Amber]
"Amber act all tough,

20:37.570 --> 20:42.616
but Amber always cry
watching sunset like big baby. Wah.

20:42.700 --> 20:46.245
Amber have big, drippy boogers. Wah."

20:46.328 --> 20:49.165
- Oh, that is rich.
- Oh! Sad little Amber.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.834
And what kind of person has boogers?

20:51.917 --> 20:54.879
- A very mad one.
- [all gasping]

20:54.962 --> 20:56.213
Amber trust Ugga.

20:56.297 --> 20:58.382
[gasps] Is she gonna cry?

20:58.466 --> 21:02.470
Amber no cry.
Amber make Ugga cry.

21:04.221 --> 21:05.514
[screams]

21:11.020 --> 21:12.188
[panting]

21:17.860 --> 21:19.737
[screaming]

21:22.323 --> 21:23.741
Did you hear about Thunk?

21:23.824 --> 21:25.993
Apparently, he ate a whole rainbow.

21:26.076 --> 21:29.163
Oh, he... he sure is fun
to talk about, Thunk.

21:31.749 --> 21:33.542
I stand by what he...
what he said.

21:35.669 --> 21:36.921
[angry growl]

21:38.255 --> 21:39.255
Amber, I'm sorry.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.425
I only told them about
you because otherwise,

21:41.509 --> 21:44.053
I have nothing interesting to say.

21:44.136 --> 21:47.223
Nobody cares that
I organize my pelts by color

21:47.306 --> 21:49.183
or that I vomit at the sight of vomit,

21:49.266 --> 21:51.602
or that I have morning breath
that could kill a mosquitoad.

21:51.685 --> 21:52.853
[growling]

21:52.937 --> 21:57.066
Aw, actually,
Amber relate to Ugga desire to fit in.

21:57.149 --> 22:00.694
And killer bad breath pretty awesome,
not boring.

22:00.778 --> 22:03.405
Amber like knowing things about Ugga.

22:03.489 --> 22:07.576
So do I. You vomit at the sight of vomit.
I thought only I did that.

22:07.660 --> 22:10.037
And pelts should be organized by color.

22:10.120 --> 22:12.832
Browns go with browns,
it just makes sense.

22:12.915 --> 22:16.126
Yes. I found a torn pelt
and am pretty sure it means

22:16.210 --> 22:19.338
one of the kids I babysit
was eaten by a bear owl.

22:21.048 --> 22:23.676
Uh, I mean, let's just watch the sunset.

22:26.262 --> 22:30.349
- [all sobbing]
- It's beautiful!

22:31.225 --> 22:33.227
I say...

22:33.310 --> 22:37.189
it's nice to finally be ourselves,
or rather, our shells.

22:38.691 --> 22:40.234
I'll see myself out.
