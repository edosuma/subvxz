00:07.916 --> 00:10.708
-Helderon root?
-<i>Pretty sure he's tried it.</i>

00:10.791 --> 00:13.250
Can you remember what the bites
on Devin looked like?

00:13.333 --> 00:16.791
Multiple incisions, a pattern?
Might narrow it down.

00:16.875 --> 00:18.416
<i>It doesn't matter.</i>

00:19.166 --> 00:22.375
<i>This is a useless exercise.</i>
<i>Dad already said he won't let you help.</i>

00:22.458 --> 00:25.208
-I'm very convincing.
-<i>More so than Rosalind?</i>

00:25.291 --> 00:28.250
<i>'Cause she was very clear</i>
<i>no students were allowed near Devin.</i>

00:28.333 --> 00:31.583
<i>Dad won't do anything she doesn't</i>
<i>approve of. Pathetic as that is.</i>

00:31.666 --> 00:34.166
-Lay off him.
-<i>You need to get back to school.2</i>

00:34.916 --> 00:37.500
<i>-It's dangerous.</i>
-I'll be done when I'm done.

00:54.208 --> 00:55.208
Whoever you are,

00:56.291 --> 00:58.125
I'd come out very, very slowly.

01:22.541 --> 01:23.708
Flora!

01:23.791 --> 01:24.833
Miss me?

01:47.208 --> 01:50.458
Really, can I please convince all of you
to stop being so helpful?

01:50.541 --> 01:52.916
I could've gone six months
without unpacking.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.791
Then we'd find Terra at night
with a headlamp doing it all herself.

01:56.875 --> 01:59.000
I was saying,
Flora grew up all over.

01:59.083 --> 02:01.458
Bit of a wild lifestyle
for my aunt and uncle's work.

02:01.541 --> 02:04.208
As wild as horticultural
research fellows can be.

02:04.291 --> 02:05.291
So, extremely?

02:05.375 --> 02:08.166
And you're cousins? Like actual cousins?

02:08.250 --> 02:11.333
Uh, second cousins by marriage.

02:11.416 --> 02:14.000
But weirdly,
we have the same crooked pinkies.

02:16.791 --> 02:17.625
Coffee?

02:22.125 --> 02:23.333
Flora…

02:23.416 --> 02:25.541
…you are saving my life.

02:26.125 --> 02:29.000
All my people in one place.
Can't believe how lucky I am.

02:29.083 --> 02:30.958
Lucky is one word for our situation.

02:32.583 --> 02:36.875
We do have a new and extremely
questionable headmistress.

02:36.958 --> 02:39.208
And a curfew because of the missing twins.

02:39.291 --> 02:41.500
The water pressure
in the shower's not great.

02:41.583 --> 02:43.250
Right. And Devin.

02:45.291 --> 02:46.708
Terra told me what happened.

02:46.791 --> 02:48.833
-That we have no idea.
-Not totally true.

02:56.416 --> 02:59.125
The last thing he said
before he passed out was "Rosalind."

02:59.708 --> 03:03.125
But the bite marks are still a mystery.
He's been unconscious since.

03:03.208 --> 03:05.416
-Have any of you seen him?

03:06.416 --> 03:07.291
Just one of us.

03:07.916 --> 03:10.291
An answering service
isn't what I had in mind

03:10.375 --> 03:12.125
when trying to speak to my mother.

03:13.083 --> 03:16.125
I understand
that her comings and goings are private.

03:16.208 --> 03:17.750
She's the queen of Solaria.

03:18.875 --> 03:20.375
But I am the princess,

03:20.458 --> 03:24.750
which is exactly why I cannot
and will not share a room.

03:27.416 --> 03:28.500
Yes?

03:30.125 --> 03:33.500
This sucks for you, I get that.
But you'll barely even notice me.

03:33.583 --> 03:35.750
I promise. I can be invisible.

03:38.916 --> 03:40.791
-She's great, right?
-She's tops.

03:40.875 --> 03:43.083
You guys like her?
I know you just met, but…

03:49.416 --> 03:50.541
What does Grey think?

03:51.625 --> 03:53.375
-Hmm?

03:53.458 --> 03:55.083
-About Flora?

03:55.666 --> 03:58.083
Flora, right. Uh, she seems great.

03:58.666 --> 04:01.250
Bit odd she transferred mid-year,
but to each their own.

04:01.333 --> 04:02.541
Flora's weird like that.

04:02.625 --> 04:06.416
She seems like the quiet one, but she,
um, definitely does her own thing.

04:07.083 --> 04:09.000
I'll make sure she stays out of trouble.

04:09.083 --> 04:12.166
If we want to find out what Rosalind's
up to, we have to be careful.

04:13.583 --> 04:15.708
And even more so now.

04:15.791 --> 04:18.250
After the Silva thing,
she's fully out for blood.

04:18.750 --> 04:22.458
The river has been dredged
and we've expanded our search perimeter.

04:23.583 --> 04:24.625
Saul won't get away.

04:25.375 --> 04:26.708
He's already got away.

04:28.041 --> 04:30.000
You're saying you won't lose him twice?

04:30.583 --> 04:33.125
<i>I hadn't considered</i>
<i>you might lose him twice, Andreas.</i>

04:33.875 --> 04:35.458
<i>One massive fuckup's enough.</i>

04:36.041 --> 04:37.041
Don't you think?

04:43.458 --> 04:45.416
Sign-offs for you, headmistress.

04:58.958 --> 04:59.958
Yes?

05:00.041 --> 05:03.500
I've looked at the records from Solaria.
Maps, vehicle reports.

05:03.583 --> 05:06.791
Andreas did not just lose him.
I know Silva had help. He had to.

05:08.166 --> 05:11.666
And from these reports you've studied,
you've found proof?

05:11.750 --> 05:12.583
No.

05:12.666 --> 05:15.291
You thought I hadn't been able
to put it together

05:15.375 --> 05:17.125
that a collapsed bridge,

05:17.208 --> 05:19.250
a broken-down engine,

05:19.333 --> 05:21.875
and a key in the lap of our convict

05:21.958 --> 05:24.583
might have meant
that Silva had outside help?

05:28.875 --> 05:33.250
-Mm. Thank you for your… expert sleuthing.

05:34.458 --> 05:35.458
Bloom!

05:38.083 --> 05:39.541
How lovely to see you.

05:50.166 --> 05:52.833
Please tell me how I'm supposed
to shampoo with one hand?

05:52.916 --> 05:56.500
Well, you can still use this hand
to squeeze a bottle.

05:56.583 --> 05:57.791
Keep it out of water.

05:58.375 --> 06:02.375
And then you can use the other one
like a one-handed massage thing.

06:03.708 --> 06:06.458
No. No, no, no, no. Keep going.
I'm learning a lot.

06:08.708 --> 06:09.791
Me and Francesca split.

06:11.666 --> 06:14.666
Greasy hair is not helpful
during a breakup at boarding school.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.625
I think your cousin needs a save.

06:25.750 --> 06:27.625
And you're sure I can't help at all?

06:27.708 --> 06:30.291
Headmistress wants
an itemized list of everything.

06:31.375 --> 06:35.250
Straight to the Bastion. We won't get
a write-up from Rosalind because of you.

06:35.333 --> 06:38.333
There's nothing in there
remotely fun or worth stealing.

06:38.416 --> 06:39.708
Leave the girl alone.

06:45.666 --> 06:49.166
Guess you'll have to catch me up
on the deal with him later? Ryven?

06:49.250 --> 06:50.583
-Riven.
-Hmm.

06:50.666 --> 06:52.041
Weird name. Cute guy though.

06:54.416 --> 06:56.916
-What?
-He's got a girlfriend. And a boyfriend.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.625
And extremely toxic tendencies.
He's like one giant red flag.

07:01.833 --> 07:04.500
Hmm. So, you're saying
I should go for it?

07:05.416 --> 07:06.791
Did you rearrange all this?

07:06.875 --> 07:09.833
I was thinking if we got the winter roots
down to room temp,

07:09.916 --> 07:12.041
their potency would be concentrated.

07:12.833 --> 07:14.958
-Where are the summer herbs?
-West wall.

07:15.708 --> 07:17.916
Of course they are.
West wall.

07:18.791 --> 07:20.250
That's not what I would do.

07:23.708 --> 07:26.916
Mind if I leave you solo
for a min?

07:27.000 --> 07:28.291
Of course.

07:30.208 --> 07:33.125
Please, don't move anything else.

07:34.166 --> 07:36.041
<i> She's a total smoke show.</i>

07:36.125 --> 07:39.708
But like a stealth smoke show.
Doesn't need to prove she's a smoke show.

07:39.791 --> 07:43.375
Can you stop saying "smoke show?"
We all know Beatrix has you whipped.

07:43.458 --> 07:46.166
If you wanna say something,
can it at least not be bullshit?

07:46.250 --> 07:47.500
Yeah?

08:03.666 --> 08:04.541
Let's go.

08:29.333 --> 08:30.166
Dane.

08:30.250 --> 08:32.833
-What?

08:33.416 --> 08:34.333
What?!

08:36.750 --> 08:41.166
Are you gonna be in the room later?
Looks like Dane might need a smoke.

08:41.250 --> 08:43.500
I'll be with Bloom. Room's all yours.

08:43.583 --> 08:47.083
Ah. Thanks. Well, let me know
when you want the favor returned.

08:48.500 --> 08:49.333
Okay.

08:50.083 --> 08:52.583
You know, for you and Bloom to…

08:54.375 --> 08:56.916
Oh my God.
Please tell me you two have shagged.

08:58.375 --> 09:00.458
I see the problem! I see it.

09:00.541 --> 09:05.083
No, Fire Fairy, strong emotions.
Worried she's gonna burn your pee-pee off?

09:05.166 --> 09:08.375
-She's not gonna burn my… What the fuck?
-It's a valid concern.

09:08.458 --> 09:10.500
Hey, sometimes love hurts, man.

09:11.666 --> 09:13.375
"And so it was on that day

09:13.458 --> 09:17.541
whence the Company of Light
rained Hellfire on the Army of Darkness."

09:17.625 --> 09:21.708
"But the bond between foes
ne’er did break. And--"

09:21.791 --> 09:23.500
Carry on. I'll be back.

09:25.166 --> 09:28.500
"Marion vowed, bound at the breast,
upon her life she would…

09:31.375 --> 09:34.916
…summon from the deepest
corners of darkness a shadow power…"

10:36.750 --> 10:38.166
Anything interesting?

10:39.458 --> 10:41.208
Okay, I'm sorry. I was just, um…

10:49.625 --> 10:52.291
-What happened to Devin?
-He was attacked.

10:52.375 --> 10:53.416
But by what?

10:55.000 --> 10:56.541
Everyone is talking about it.

10:56.625 --> 11:00.000
I have limited time, Bloom.
Save the gossip for your friends.

11:00.083 --> 11:02.875
So, am I just completely
being left in the dark here?

11:07.166 --> 11:09.458
One of our classmates got attacked.

11:11.750 --> 11:14.083
And we're reading old books.
Not even training.

11:14.166 --> 11:19.125
Yes, because sometimes the words
in old books are more useful than magic.

11:22.333 --> 11:23.500
Knowledge is power.

11:24.666 --> 11:27.166
A cliché for a reason.

11:29.333 --> 11:30.833
You don't know where you came from.

11:30.916 --> 11:33.750
If you did,
don't you think you'd be more powerful?

11:36.208 --> 11:37.541
Don't know if it matters.

11:37.625 --> 11:40.125
Of course it does.
It's always better to know more.

11:42.041 --> 11:44.125
Even if it makes you uncomfortable.

11:48.083 --> 11:49.125
For instance,

11:50.916 --> 11:54.125
I know you were snooping in my office.

11:56.125 --> 11:57.583
A shit feeling,

11:57.666 --> 11:59.958
but it puts me at an advantage.

12:00.041 --> 12:02.333
It tells me I can't trust you.

12:05.541 --> 12:06.875
And trust is vital.

12:10.250 --> 12:11.791
I'd hate this to break down.

12:13.291 --> 12:16.166
You wouldn't wanna burn any bridges,
would you, Bloom?

12:23.250 --> 12:24.666
You were on the First Dominion.

12:27.708 --> 12:29.125
There in her drawer.

12:29.625 --> 12:32.375
The pincers on that thing
match the bite marks on Devin.

12:32.458 --> 12:34.416
It's what attacked him. Rosalind knows it.

12:34.500 --> 12:37.375
-<i> Wish I recognized the language.</i>
-<i>Terra didn't either.</i>

12:37.458 --> 12:41.375
It's one of the dead ones. Rosalind must
have got the book from the Royal Archives.

12:41.458 --> 12:44.500
I think I remember
some of these symbols from school.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.666
I was a bit of a history buff.

12:47.166 --> 12:50.791
Um, I can probably figure some
of this out, but it'll take some time.

12:50.875 --> 12:52.583
We don't have time.

12:52.666 --> 12:54.625
Three fairies are missing.
Only one is back.

12:54.708 --> 12:58.416
<i>Whatever is in that book,</i>
<i>it's the key to what Rosalind is up to.</i>

12:58.916 --> 13:01.541
What about if we had a guide
to help us translate it?

13:02.041 --> 13:04.958
<i>It would be a start,</i>
<i>but there are thousands of symbols.</i>

13:05.500 --> 13:07.750
<i>There should be</i>
<i>a translation text in the library.</i>

13:08.333 --> 13:13.416
Uh, Rosalind closed the library. She said
she's weeding out inaccurate propaganda.

13:13.500 --> 13:16.375
Always a good sign
when a leader controls access to books.

13:16.458 --> 13:18.541
<i>My house. There's one at my house.</i>

13:19.250 --> 13:23.375
<i>The bookcase in the sitting room.</i>
<i>You know where I mean, don't you, Stella?</i>

13:23.458 --> 13:24.875
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

13:26.541 --> 13:27.708
I've been there with Sky.

13:29.333 --> 13:30.166
Oh…

13:30.666 --> 13:31.583
Sky's house.

13:33.041 --> 13:35.833
Yeah, I'm…
I'm not sure Sky would want to go.

13:38.333 --> 13:42.208
I have class off
to, uh, do reading for Rosalind.

13:42.291 --> 13:45.000
<i>I can probably borrow the Harveys' car</i>
<i>and just slip out.</i>

13:45.083 --> 13:46.666
I'll draw you a map to the house.

13:54.416 --> 13:56.000
The same. Just pain.

13:56.916 --> 14:00.125
I know you're doing everything you can.
You might not be able to help him.

14:00.208 --> 14:03.416
We might never figure out
what that thing was in Rosalind's book.

14:03.958 --> 14:07.458
We have to wake him up, find out
what happened, or any of us could be next.

14:07.541 --> 14:08.375
Terra.

14:10.416 --> 14:11.250
I need a win.

14:12.916 --> 14:14.166
My family needs a win.

14:14.750 --> 14:16.250
I can feel us ripping apart.

14:16.875 --> 14:19.208
You Harveys kinda care
about each other, huh?

14:20.250 --> 14:23.375
-Terra, are you in here?
-Yeah, just a sec.

14:23.458 --> 14:26.583
What about Flora being here?
Should be amazing for you, right?

14:26.666 --> 14:29.541
Uh, yeah, it is. Love Flora.

14:30.291 --> 14:33.125
-She doesn't always simplify things.

14:33.625 --> 14:38.625
Hey, sorry, I know I'm not supposed
to be back here, but… Ah. Thanks.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
Oh.

14:43.291 --> 14:44.541
Yeah, I know. It's bad.

14:48.083 --> 14:50.125
Has your dad tried Eldwyn Amalgam?

14:50.208 --> 14:53.291
Of course. Eldwyn root
was one of the first things we tried.

14:53.791 --> 14:56.875
Right. Except I didn't say Eldwyn root.
I said Eldwyn Amalgam.

14:56.958 --> 14:59.833
-It's similar but it's a compound--
-Flora, I said we tried it.

15:00.500 --> 15:03.791
Okay, we'd better get to class.
Don't want to get a citation.

15:07.583 --> 15:09.458
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

15:12.583 --> 15:14.750
-For the map.
-Thank you.

15:20.958 --> 15:22.166
Sky will come round.

15:23.916 --> 15:24.958
I'm serious.

15:25.958 --> 15:30.875
I, uh… I watch a ton of '90s sitcoms.
I'm pretty sure I know how families work.

15:34.208 --> 15:35.416
-Hide.
-What you doing?

15:35.500 --> 15:36.916
Get in. Stay.

15:42.875 --> 15:45.291
Sebastian, long time no see.

15:50.458 --> 15:53.000
Sweet you stayed so near Alfea, Basti.

15:53.958 --> 15:55.750
It makes sense you'd stay close.

15:55.833 --> 15:59.833
You were always such a teacher's pet,
following Saul around like a dog.

16:02.291 --> 16:03.333
How about now?

16:04.875 --> 16:06.541
Keeping up with him these days?

16:07.125 --> 16:08.041
Well, uh,

16:08.750 --> 16:10.083
he hasn't beeped me.

16:26.666 --> 16:29.166
I don't know where he is.
I haven't heard from him.

16:29.666 --> 16:30.833
Really?

16:34.083 --> 16:37.291
-Andreas, I wouldn't. You know I wouldn't.

16:57.208 --> 16:58.833
I'll be back around, Basti.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.166
You all right?

17:30.958 --> 17:32.041
Yeah, fine.

17:33.500 --> 17:34.333
I'm sorry.

17:35.041 --> 17:38.875
They're, uh… they're gonna find out
this is a portal soon enough, you know.

17:41.083 --> 17:41.916
I know.

17:46.458 --> 17:47.625
Really?

17:47.708 --> 17:49.083
-I was reading that!
-Yeah?

17:49.166 --> 17:50.750
-Yeah.
-What was the last sentence?

17:52.791 --> 17:55.583
Hither thither thine…

17:56.958 --> 17:57.833
Mosaics!

18:00.083 --> 18:01.916
You passed with flying colors.

18:07.666 --> 18:08.750
Rosalind?

18:08.833 --> 18:10.125
Mm-hmm.

18:14.375 --> 18:15.500
Andreas?

18:17.375 --> 18:18.250
Mm-hmm.

18:21.166 --> 18:22.875
I have to go to Silva's house.

18:26.083 --> 18:26.916
Your…

18:27.416 --> 18:28.291
your house.

18:30.291 --> 18:32.625
And I'm not asking for your help.

18:32.708 --> 18:35.541
-I just… I can't not tell you.
-It's okay, Bloom.

18:37.291 --> 18:38.291
I'll take you.

18:38.375 --> 18:42.250
No, you… I can't ask you
to get involved. Rosalind, she's--

18:42.333 --> 18:45.625
You need a break. I need a break.
Let's get the hell out of here.

19:03.583 --> 19:05.125
This is where you grew up?

19:08.083 --> 19:10.000
So little kid Sky, just…

19:10.083 --> 19:14.000
What, he spent his life
just frolicking in this wondrousness?

19:14.708 --> 19:15.791
Well, he didn't frolic.

19:15.875 --> 19:19.958
Well, he missed out.
I love a frolic.

19:22.208 --> 19:23.208
So do it.

19:24.166 --> 19:26.291
We're stuck on campus 24/7, Bloom.

19:26.375 --> 19:28.958
We can't even walk the hallways
unless they say so.

19:29.458 --> 19:31.541
-Go frolic.

19:36.208 --> 19:37.875
This is amazing!

19:37.958 --> 19:39.916
-I'm frolicking!

19:44.916 --> 19:46.125
Sky!

19:46.875 --> 19:49.666
Sky, there are horses here.
Like actual wild horses.

19:56.916 --> 19:58.458
Did you ever try to ride them?

20:03.000 --> 20:04.916
<i>-Come on.
</i>

20:26.625 --> 20:28.416
They're, um… they're our horses.

20:30.708 --> 20:31.833
Ass.

20:35.291 --> 20:37.208
Wanna know what's better than frolicking?

20:55.458 --> 20:57.375
-You okay?
-Uh-huh!

20:57.458 --> 20:58.583
-Yeah?

21:03.958 --> 21:07.291
-This is amazing!

21:23.708 --> 21:26.083
-Ah!

21:47.916 --> 21:51.000
All those fairy tales
about princesses trapped inside castles,

21:52.000 --> 21:55.291
and not one of them has a princess
torturing herself to get out.

21:55.791 --> 21:56.875
Points for originality.

21:58.625 --> 22:01.041
-May I help you?
-I'm looking for Sky.

22:01.125 --> 22:04.041
I know you love a good stalk.
Got tabs today?

22:07.500 --> 22:10.500
How about three days ago
when Silva broke out of the caravan?

22:11.000 --> 22:12.375
What, you think Sky helped?

22:13.166 --> 22:14.250
Well, somebody did.

22:16.083 --> 22:18.958
Maybe Andreas just isn't as great
as you think he is.

22:19.875 --> 22:23.416
I know it's disappointing when parents
don't live up to expectations. I do.

22:24.041 --> 22:25.583
Do you know where he was or not?

22:27.083 --> 22:29.083
I saw him that afternoon, Beatrix.

22:30.083 --> 22:32.333
So to quote another tortured princess,

22:33.166 --> 22:34.000
just let it go.

22:40.666 --> 22:45.083
So Bloom and Sky are a thing now,
but Stella and Sky were a thing last year.

22:45.666 --> 22:47.208
And that's fine?

22:48.000 --> 22:50.416
-Come on, it's a little weird.
-Medium weird.

22:50.916 --> 22:52.375
And you're with Sam?

22:52.458 --> 22:55.791
Love Sam. But that's clearly
weird for you, right, Terra?

22:55.875 --> 22:59.958
No. What is weird, some of the reactions,
so maybe we could all pay attention.

23:00.041 --> 23:02.125
-Okay, so it's very weird.

23:02.208 --> 23:04.791
You're clearly in love
with whoever you're texting.

23:04.875 --> 23:06.333
It's not anyone's brother or ex?

23:06.416 --> 23:09.541
I don't think everybody
wants to get into their sexual histories.

23:09.625 --> 23:12.291
-I'm not having sex with anyone.
-He's Sam's roommate.

23:12.375 --> 23:14.125
So it's only awkward adjacent.

23:14.208 --> 23:17.000
Okay, no sex. Just texting.

23:17.083 --> 23:20.375
If things are going well without him,
why risk adding uncertainty?

23:20.458 --> 23:24.625
Well, just surprise. Romance.

23:24.708 --> 23:27.583
Discovering a part of yourself
you never knew existed.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.458
Or abs. Hey, maybe the answer's abs.

23:33.833 --> 23:34.666
Right.

23:38.333 --> 23:39.333
See you in a bit.

23:40.458 --> 23:43.333
We should find
a scandal-worthy hookup for you.

23:43.416 --> 23:46.083
Wait. Is there somebody already?
You have to tell me!

23:46.166 --> 23:49.375
You said you didn't love the lifeguard,
then pretended to drown.

23:49.458 --> 23:53.458
-No, and can we just let that story die?
-Okay.

23:54.458 --> 23:56.916
I just don't want
you getting distracted by all this.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.791
-What do you mean?
-Is that your lab report?

24:01.208 --> 24:02.375
It's so thorough.

24:02.875 --> 24:05.375
Yeah. I had a tutor with me
on the expedition,

24:05.458 --> 24:07.875
so we went through this stuff
a few years ago.

24:08.375 --> 24:10.541
Also, I'm not trying to beat a dead horse,

24:10.625 --> 24:13.541
but I wrote down the formula
to the Eldwyn Amalgam.

24:13.625 --> 24:15.666
-If you could give it to your dad.
-Mm.

24:15.750 --> 24:19.916
Um, I'll look it over. Want to make sure
there are no negative reactions.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.958
We know there'll be a negative reaction
from doing nothing.

24:23.041 --> 24:25.750
I'm not doing nothing.
Some things need to be thought through.

24:25.833 --> 24:27.500
I did think it through.

24:27.583 --> 24:31.583
And you've been saying how important it is
to wake Devin up, so this could do it.

24:34.333 --> 24:36.541
-Terra?
-I said I'll look it over.

24:40.791 --> 24:41.916
In the flesh.

24:43.083 --> 24:44.083
I'll see ya.

24:45.541 --> 24:46.458
Fancy an escort?

24:51.500 --> 24:55.166
I sometimes wear one
when it's cold, but wetsuits are just--

24:55.250 --> 24:57.750
-Like swimming in a sleeping bag.
-Exactly.

24:58.375 --> 25:01.291
Well, I'm gonna… I'll…

25:02.458 --> 25:03.291
Right.

25:03.791 --> 25:09.000
So about that. I'm not saying
that I don't enjoy texting, but

25:10.208 --> 25:11.916
I'd like to see you

25:13.000 --> 25:13.833
in person.

25:15.333 --> 25:17.916
Even if it's just for a walk or a swim.

25:19.875 --> 25:20.916
Yeah, of course.

25:24.458 --> 25:25.416
It's just…

25:27.000 --> 25:28.416
I've got a lot going on.

25:30.666 --> 25:31.541
Okay, look,

25:32.291 --> 25:34.041
I think you like me,

25:34.125 --> 25:37.416
which is great, 'cause I like you.

25:38.875 --> 25:41.375
But then why does it feel
like I'm in cyber limbo?

25:48.041 --> 25:50.083
All right, then.

26:09.500 --> 26:10.958
So, you're a total horse girl?

26:12.333 --> 26:13.625
What was the deal?

26:14.958 --> 26:15.916
Horse figurines?

26:17.000 --> 26:21.541
No, wait, horse rainbow posters
all over your bedroom wall.

26:23.375 --> 26:24.375
We should, um…

26:25.291 --> 26:26.583
we should, uh, get back.

26:27.166 --> 26:29.791
-Curfew.
-Well, the house.

26:30.541 --> 26:33.625
-I still have to get the translation text.
-Right.

26:34.333 --> 26:36.125
-You should be quick.

26:37.083 --> 26:38.166
You're not coming?

26:39.000 --> 26:41.291
-It's your house.
-No.

26:41.375 --> 26:42.833
Y-you don't wanna…

26:44.083 --> 26:45.125
I'm not going in.

26:46.500 --> 26:48.791
Once we figure out what Rosalind's hiding

26:48.875 --> 26:51.083
and we get the school
back to the way it was…

26:54.250 --> 26:56.500
you and Silva,
you're gonna figure this out.

26:59.583 --> 27:00.583
I know you will.

27:16.958 --> 27:19.208
I'll just have
to see him for myself.

27:27.750 --> 27:31.125
No consciousness? No speech?

27:31.625 --> 27:32.458
No.

27:37.083 --> 27:41.291
We've spent enough resources.
It's time to move him to the Capitol.

27:41.375 --> 27:44.333
We owe it to him
to get to the bottom of what happened.

27:44.416 --> 27:46.416
Something you're clearly not capable of.

27:46.916 --> 27:49.833
By my accounts,
he's only got worse under your care.

27:49.916 --> 27:53.000
For his own safety at least,
he's no longer your concern.

27:53.708 --> 27:58.416
As for what is, Andreas has paid a visit
to our old pal, Sebastian.

28:00.208 --> 28:02.000
Brilliant suggestion on your part.

28:02.500 --> 28:03.791
He might have a lead.

28:04.291 --> 28:06.666
Any other ideas, you know where to come.

28:07.333 --> 28:09.375
As long as my children stay safe.

28:14.208 --> 28:15.333
I'll arrange his move.

28:17.083 --> 28:18.166
Tomorrow.

28:35.375 --> 28:37.458
Andreas just snapped a bit.

28:38.541 --> 28:40.916
I'm never one
to justify toxic masculinity,

28:41.000 --> 28:44.333
but you can't take anything he says
personally right now.

28:44.916 --> 28:46.541
It's just pressure. Silva shit.

28:46.625 --> 28:48.083
I told you both, I'm fine.

28:52.750 --> 28:55.583
Oh. Speak of the actual devil.

29:02.083 --> 29:03.416
Yes, lucky kitten.

29:25.416 --> 29:27.750
Folds his pants. Fuck me.

29:31.458 --> 29:32.333
Beatrix.

29:37.791 --> 29:40.333
Why the fuck
are you going through Sky's stuff?

29:40.416 --> 29:42.041
I need to know who helped Silva.

29:43.041 --> 29:45.250
Andreas is not safe right now.

29:46.458 --> 29:48.708
I can't lose him, Riv. He's my dad.

29:50.666 --> 29:54.666
Bea, I don't know
exactly what happened that day,

29:55.541 --> 29:58.291
but… you're right.

29:59.541 --> 30:01.541
I don't think he got away by himself.

30:01.625 --> 30:02.458
It just…

30:03.541 --> 30:04.625
It wasn't Sky.

30:05.500 --> 30:07.208
And you didn't see anything?

30:12.083 --> 30:13.833
I've got to go.

31:32.750 --> 31:34.000
It's a shrine.

31:34.916 --> 31:36.625
Silva gave me every piece.

31:37.333 --> 31:40.500
Every piece of my untouchable hero dad.

31:42.958 --> 31:43.791
Sky--

31:43.875 --> 31:46.041
You wanna get Alfea
back to the way it was.

31:48.416 --> 31:50.041
That can never happen for me.

31:51.041 --> 31:52.750
I can't not know what I know.

31:54.166 --> 31:55.375
I know what it's like.

31:56.291 --> 31:59.333
To get answers to questions
that you never meant to ask.

32:00.666 --> 32:02.458
Answers that change everything.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.375
And the moment
you started to get those answers,

32:08.666 --> 32:10.125
you stopped looking, right?

32:11.458 --> 32:13.416
You didn't want your life to be defined

32:13.500 --> 32:16.708
by some horrific revelation
about where you came from.

32:19.041 --> 32:20.125
It's too late for me.

32:20.625 --> 32:22.750
You're not defined
by Andreas, Sky.

32:23.250 --> 32:26.375
Not this… fake hero or the real monster.

32:31.666 --> 32:33.500
You're defined by what you do.

32:34.166 --> 32:35.250
And who you are.

32:42.708 --> 32:43.750
You are kind.

32:44.875 --> 32:46.250
And you are honest.

32:47.750 --> 32:52.083
And you torture yourself on the inside
so that you can be strong on the outside.

32:53.791 --> 32:55.458
You put everyone else first.

32:55.958 --> 32:59.416
-I know you.

32:59.500 --> 33:02.541
-The real you.

34:26.750 --> 34:27.625
Are you okay?

34:30.500 --> 34:31.375
Talk to me.

34:31.958 --> 34:32.833
I can't.

34:33.375 --> 34:37.500
Not here. You never know
who Rosalind has under her thumb.

34:51.166 --> 34:53.208
Come on. Let's go somewhere quiet.

35:00.166 --> 35:01.916
-Okay, now what did you want--

35:08.291 --> 35:10.375
Sam, key word. Talk.

35:11.125 --> 35:12.541
It's not that big a deal.

35:13.791 --> 35:16.666
I know you don't think it is
at this moment, but it is.

35:18.291 --> 35:19.291
Oh my God.

35:23.541 --> 35:24.375
Terra?

35:27.791 --> 35:31.541
Eldwyn Amalgam. Not that Flora knows
anything about the case,

35:31.625 --> 35:33.666
but this combination she suggested…

35:33.750 --> 35:35.875
Wait.
Have you been in here all day?

35:36.625 --> 35:37.708
It's an adrenalizer.

35:37.791 --> 35:41.208
I looked it up and Flora's right,
it could wake Devin up.

35:41.708 --> 35:44.625
But it's extremely powerful.
If he reacts badly to it,

35:46.000 --> 35:47.125
<i>it could be lethal,</i>

35:48.458 --> 35:49.791
<i>even with an antidote.</i>

35:52.541 --> 35:55.208
-<i>Terra, that sounds dangerous.</i>
-<i>It is.</i>

35:57.500 --> 35:58.916
Devin. Devin, you're okay.

35:59.000 --> 36:02.041
I'm here to help.
Is this what attacked you?

36:02.791 --> 36:04.291
That's… that's what…

36:04.375 --> 36:05.708
Devin. Devin, you're okay.

36:06.500 --> 36:07.375
I'm here to help.

36:08.333 --> 36:09.916
Get it off! Get it off!

36:10.416 --> 36:12.208
Get it off!

36:12.291 --> 36:14.916
Where's the antidote?
For the Eldwyn Amalgam. Where is it?

36:15.000 --> 36:17.958
-I didn't know there was one.
-I have to get it off!

36:20.250 --> 36:23.916
-He's gonna hurt himself.
-I have to get it off.

36:46.125 --> 36:48.125
-No, no, no!

36:48.208 --> 36:50.958
I can't feel… Give it.

36:51.666 --> 36:52.750
Where's my magic?

37:07.500 --> 37:08.791
Shit.

37:09.875 --> 37:11.500
I should've been paying attention.

37:11.583 --> 37:14.166
Let's just tell your dad.
I doubt he'd tell Rosalind.

37:14.250 --> 37:16.541
We have no idea
what my dad would tell Rosalind.

37:17.583 --> 37:19.125
-Sam!

37:19.208 --> 37:21.083
Jesus, Aisha. What the hell?

37:24.416 --> 37:27.291
Sorry.
Thought you were a guard.

37:33.166 --> 37:34.333
What the hell was that?

37:34.416 --> 37:37.791
-I think he was just startled.
-No. What you just did. To him.

37:37.875 --> 37:40.833
We all need to clear our heads.
I just took the edge off.

37:40.916 --> 37:43.291
Using your magic?
Musa, that seems like a bad--

37:43.375 --> 37:45.916
It's fine. Everybody needs it sometimes.

37:46.000 --> 37:49.166
Reckon we'd have got Silva out
if I hadn't stopped you freaking out?

37:50.666 --> 37:52.333
Devin can't be far. Come on.

38:06.708 --> 38:09.041
-I'm not looking.

38:20.291 --> 38:21.791
Bloom? What? What is it?

38:27.708 --> 38:29.625
Shit, it's Andreas. It's Andreas!

38:35.875 --> 38:37.458
What if we get caught?

38:38.125 --> 38:39.541
Rosalind won't be back.

38:39.625 --> 38:42.958
She spends every night in the East Wing
working on super mysterious shit

38:43.041 --> 38:45.750
she won't tell me about
because I haven't earned her trust.

38:45.833 --> 38:48.625
And now I have an opportunity
to do just that.

38:48.708 --> 38:51.666
-Yeah, I mean, Riven is a douchebag.

38:51.750 --> 38:55.166
Grade A.
But, um, he really cares about you.

38:55.250 --> 38:58.916
-I'm aware. It's cloying.
-It's okay to care about him.

38:59.708 --> 39:01.125
You can let this one go.

39:01.916 --> 39:05.666
-God, this is driving me fucking insane.

39:07.958 --> 39:09.333
-Shit!

39:13.500 --> 39:17.041
If I'd known, I'd have made the antidote.
I just wanted to wake him up.

39:17.125 --> 39:19.666
-Well, you certainly did that.
-I'm just trying to help.

39:19.750 --> 39:21.875
-It's the whole reason I'm here.
-What?

39:21.958 --> 39:25.375
My parents told me how hard things have
been for your dad since Rosalind.

39:25.458 --> 39:27.500
That's why I came. For you.

39:30.958 --> 39:32.791
-Any news?
-Stella's found Devin.

39:33.791 --> 39:34.708
It's ready.

39:34.791 --> 39:37.625
-It's an old hiding place. Just…

39:38.125 --> 39:39.833
He can't know we're here.

39:40.458 --> 39:42.125
-I'll be right behind you.
-Okay.

40:34.833 --> 40:35.833
Rosalind.

40:37.875 --> 40:38.708
He woke up?

40:39.416 --> 40:42.291
You said he was barely holding on
when he escaped the lab.

40:43.958 --> 40:45.416
Has he spoken to anyone?

40:46.708 --> 40:50.625
We should be there in case he does.
You sure the others are secure?

41:08.791 --> 41:12.833
Someone was here.
Probably someone who knows where Silva is.

41:14.000 --> 41:15.750
This should send them a message.

41:17.625 --> 41:18.458
Now,

41:19.666 --> 41:20.625
burn it down.

41:38.750 --> 41:40.166
We can't stay here.

41:44.166 --> 41:47.208
-What if he hasn't left?
-Get out! Just get out!

41:49.208 --> 41:50.250
Go! Go!

42:00.708 --> 42:03.958
-They're still out there.
-It's okay. It's safe in here. I got this.

42:07.291 --> 42:09.125
-Where's Rosalind?
-I can stop him.

42:09.208 --> 42:11.791
No, don't. You could kill him.
Terra has this.

42:16.166 --> 42:17.083
Devin.

42:17.833 --> 42:20.166
Devin, this is gonna fix
how you're feeling.

42:20.250 --> 42:22.625
-Step away from him.
-Rosalind.

42:24.666 --> 42:27.125
What did you do to me?

42:27.208 --> 42:29.791
Stand back. He's just confused.

42:34.250 --> 42:36.000
And under the influence of something.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.458
-Get out of my head.
-Headmistress, he needs this now.

42:39.541 --> 42:42.750
-If you'd just let me--
-I said stand back.

42:44.916 --> 42:46.750
Just a little further.

42:46.833 --> 42:47.750
Get out of--

42:59.375 --> 43:00.291
He's dead.

43:04.625 --> 43:06.750
-What did you give him?
-I…

43:06.833 --> 43:09.291
Eldwyn Amalgam. It was me. I'm sorry.

43:10.291 --> 43:14.583
I went behind everyone's back. I thought
I could help him, but I… I… I was wrong.

43:18.125 --> 43:19.166
Everyone out.

44:03.291 --> 44:05.208
I talked Rosalind off expulsion.

44:10.375 --> 44:13.666
I never thought I'd be begging
to keep your sister at this school.

44:18.500 --> 44:22.083
Really I wonder
if expulsion would be the better option.

44:24.208 --> 44:25.208
What do you mean?

44:26.958 --> 44:29.750
I mean maybe our family
doesn't belong at Alfea anymore.

44:31.541 --> 44:32.791
It's tearing us apart.

44:33.416 --> 44:36.375
No, Dad. Rosalind is tearing us apart.

44:36.958 --> 44:37.791
Sam…

44:47.125 --> 44:50.041
I'm sorry. I know you're doing
everything you can.

44:57.250 --> 45:00.291
I can handle things here,
but there's damage in the greenhouse.

45:00.375 --> 45:02.125
Let's see how it looks then.

45:22.250 --> 45:24.500
Everyone has the photos
I took of Rosalind's book.

45:24.583 --> 45:27.083
<i>We need to match the symbols</i>
<i>with the translation text</i>

45:27.166 --> 45:28.500
<i>to break the code.</i>

45:30.625 --> 45:33.583
I thought about bringing the text
to you, Sebastian, but I…

45:33.666 --> 45:35.208
Oh. This is safer.

45:35.291 --> 45:37.791
You couldn't risk crossing Rosalind
and leaving campus.

45:38.583 --> 45:40.458
Not after what she did to Devin.

45:43.333 --> 45:45.666
I… I think I got it.

45:46.666 --> 45:50.833
<i>As far as I can tell, this is some sort</i>
<i>of summoning spell for those creatures.</i>

45:50.916 --> 45:54.500
-What element does that fall under?
-It's ancient. Not elemental.

45:54.583 --> 45:58.833
-So, Rosalind is summoning these things?
-To attack fairies? Why?

45:58.916 --> 46:01.000
Hang on, I've seen that before.

46:01.083 --> 46:01.916
Store.

46:02.000 --> 46:04.333
Or save.

46:05.708 --> 46:08.291
Hoard? That's…
that's what that symbol means.

46:08.375 --> 46:11.916
The one that looks like a J
with a table next to it. Store.

46:13.708 --> 46:14.541
Hold.

46:17.041 --> 46:17.958
Magic.

46:19.250 --> 46:20.166
Hold magic.

46:20.750 --> 46:24.250
Wait. Devin was begging Rosalind
to give him his magic back.

46:24.333 --> 46:27.500
What if Rosalind is summoning these
to steal magic from fairies?

46:28.916 --> 46:30.416
<i>To make herself stronger.</i>

46:36.666 --> 46:38.166
Your update on Silva.

46:38.250 --> 46:40.125
No concrete advances.

46:41.416 --> 46:44.333
She let Devin die
so that we wouldn't figure this out.

46:44.416 --> 46:46.875
Rosalind's already
one of the most powerful fairies.

46:46.958 --> 46:49.875
<i>The thing about power is,</i>
<i>no matter how much you have,</i>

46:50.708 --> 46:51.833
<i>it's never enough.</i>

47:07.916 --> 47:09.375
Riven knows something.

47:10.291 --> 47:13.458
Something about who helped Silva escape.
He just won't say what.

47:25.458 --> 47:26.666
Oh, very well.

47:26.750 --> 47:28.083
Everyone is dismissed.

47:33.958 --> 47:34.958
Except Riven.

47:44.166 --> 47:46.583
You're gonna tell me
everything you know about Saul Silva.

48:03.041 --> 48:03.875
Sky.
