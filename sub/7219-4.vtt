00:01.202 --> 00:03.513
<i>Previously on</i> Justified...

00:03.604 --> 00:05.777
He said he would pay me

00:05.873 --> 00:09.320
if I found out when the drugs
were coming in, so I found out.

00:09.376 --> 00:10.787
She got a cell phone on her?

00:14.314 --> 00:15.850
Hello, Cousin Johnny.

00:15.949 --> 00:18.793
Yeah, well, Mr Crowder ain't going to court.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.889
What? You're just gonna let him skate?

00:20.988 --> 00:22.831
No. I want you to kill him.

00:23.323 --> 00:24.700
Now, the money I offered Paxton,

00:24.791 --> 00:26.532
how about that ends up
under your mattress?

00:26.627 --> 00:28.004
In exchange for what?

00:28.061 --> 00:29.699
Telling him you did as he asked,

00:29.796 --> 00:32.003
put a bullet in the back of my head.

00:32.232 --> 00:35.304
Rode Dickie Bennett's shirttails out of
Tramble, on account of the scandal?

00:35.402 --> 00:36.506
How'd you know?

00:36.570 --> 00:38.550
It's protocol to tell me when a known felon

00:38.639 --> 00:40.846
who's tried to kill me a couple times
has been released.

00:40.908 --> 00:42.410
Why did you do that to Messer?

00:42.509 --> 00:45.046
I've been skimming, Dewey.

00:45.145 --> 00:46.249
You son of a bitch!

00:46.747 --> 00:49.091
Boyd put me up to it! He gave me no choice.

00:49.182 --> 00:51.184
- You're gonna kill him?
- No, Dewey.

00:51.418 --> 00:52.488
You are.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.502
It's right down here.

01:00.994 --> 01:03.406
How come you keep your money
all the way up here?

01:03.597 --> 01:05.838
I got money squirreled all over,

01:05.899 --> 01:09.437
lest some fool happen across
the whole chunk at once and clean me out.

01:11.104 --> 01:12.515
Well, I guess that's smart.

01:12.706 --> 01:14.014
Hell yeah, it's smart.

01:14.341 --> 01:17.914
All we got to do is dig it up,
pack our shit, and we're out of here.

01:18.345 --> 01:21.019
Put my cousin and all them assholes
in our rear-view.

01:21.281 --> 01:22.419
You bring the shovel?

01:25.586 --> 01:28.192
Jesus Christ, Messer.
That's all we got to dig with?

01:28.922 --> 01:30.868
You said bring a shovel. This is my shovel.

01:30.924 --> 01:32.198
Well, are you a midget?

01:32.259 --> 01:33.761
'Cause that is a midget shovel.

01:33.860 --> 01:35.771
It's from my Boy Scouts, for camping.

01:36.196 --> 01:37.539
I got it when I was a Webelo.

01:37.898 --> 01:39.138
What the hell is a Webelo?

01:39.266 --> 01:40.540
It's kind of a boy scout.

01:40.734 --> 01:42.736
They run me off' but I kept my shovel.

01:43.236 --> 01:44.476
Go on, then. Dig.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.107
Hell, you're right on the spot.

01:46.206 --> 01:47.879
- Right here?
- Yep.

01:52.913 --> 01:53.948
You ain't gonna help?

01:54.047 --> 01:55.458
Well, I didn't bring my shovel

01:55.549 --> 01:56.994
'cause you said you had one.

01:57.117 --> 01:59.620
It's not my fault
ifs some Webelo piece of shit.

02:00.754 --> 02:02.756
All right, well, I guess

02:03.590 --> 02:05.160
I ought to be thankful.

02:05.726 --> 02:08.172
I thought I was
a dead man back there for sure.

02:08.595 --> 02:11.508
But here I am making a clean start.

02:11.732 --> 02:13.439
- Shit!
- You all right?

02:13.900 --> 02:15.743
Just dig, Messer. Keep digging.

02:16.303 --> 02:17.407
Damn it.

02:18.005 --> 02:21.248
So is... ls all the money buried here?

02:21.775 --> 02:23.755
Or are we gonna have
to dig somewheres else?

02:30.283 --> 02:31.284
Dewey.

03:08.488 --> 03:09.967
Son of a bitch.

03:39.319 --> 03:40.889
Piece of shit!

04:07.380 --> 04:08.381
Messer?

04:09.750 --> 04:11.024
Wade?

04:12.586 --> 04:13.690
Wade?

04:14.755 --> 04:16.098
Where are you, man?

04:16.189 --> 04:17.634
This ain't funny.

05:05.972 --> 05:10.978
JUSTIFIED

05:13.747 --> 05:14.748
Raylan?

05:15.615 --> 05:16.616
Sorry.

05:16.683 --> 05:20.256
Pans of what you said
are just confusing to me.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.321
Which pans?

05:21.421 --> 05:24.766
The part where we're running
a confidential informant in Harlan County.

05:25.091 --> 05:29.198
The part where that CI
is Wade Messer informing on Boyd Crowder.

05:29.496 --> 05:30.804
But kind of mostly the part

05:30.864 --> 05:32.810
where you felt like
you couldn't tell me about it.

05:32.866 --> 05:35.005
- We're telling you about it now.
- We're telling you about it now.

05:35.101 --> 05:38.014
How did you ever believe
Messer would be a reliable CI?

05:38.104 --> 05:39.674
- He is a reliable CI.
- Yeah?

05:39.773 --> 05:42.515
He gave us a heroin stamp house
affiliated to Crowder just last week.

05:43.710 --> 05:45.951
How did that go?
Did you come away with any product?

05:47.013 --> 05:48.219
Not this time.

05:48.782 --> 05:50.455
Picked off a couple of boys
from his crew, though.

05:50.517 --> 05:52.497
Yeah. You got some baby laxative,

05:52.552 --> 05:54.532
a couple hundred baggies,
and two knuckleheads

05:54.621 --> 05:56.692
who don't know shit
about Boyd or anything else.

05:56.790 --> 05:58.292
How is this not on the front page?

05:58.692 --> 06:00.228
Well, the good news is
you don't have to worry

06:00.327 --> 06:03.308
about the big picture about Wade Messer
or even Boyd Crowder.

06:03.463 --> 06:05.465
All you have to worry about's
finding Wade Messer.

06:05.532 --> 06:06.977
You know the man set me up to be killed?

06:07.033 --> 06:08.034
So I recall.

06:08.134 --> 06:09.977
He's a drug addict and
a board-certified imbecile.

06:10.470 --> 06:12.143
Shouldn't be too hard to find him, then.

06:12.472 --> 06:14.349
Messer had a phone we provided him with.

06:14.407 --> 06:16.978
Was supposed to call us on it last night,
and he failed to do so.

06:17.043 --> 06:19.853
Phone GPS put him
at a certain location in Harlan County.

06:19.980 --> 06:20.981
Hasn't moved.

06:21.314 --> 06:23.885
Audry's, no "E." Familiar with the place?

06:24.184 --> 06:25.925
I'm acquainted, yes.

06:26.052 --> 06:27.998
And I know Messer took a swipe at you.

06:28.154 --> 06:29.895
That's why I'm sending Tim along.

06:30.190 --> 06:33.603
Keep you from bumbling
into some shit that I have to clean up later.

06:53.680 --> 06:55.023
Come on.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.091
Shit. I'm lost.

07:02.923 --> 07:03.924
Help!

07:06.593 --> 07:07.867
Hey!

07:16.369 --> 07:17.905
You're looking thin, cousin.

07:18.238 --> 07:19.273
Well,

07:19.372 --> 07:21.147
I have had more time on the elliptical

07:21.241 --> 07:22.743
now that I don't have to spend it wondering

07:22.809 --> 07:25.255
how and when you're gonna
stab me in the back.

07:28.882 --> 07:30.122
Where's Teri?

07:30.383 --> 07:34.661
Well, she should be dropped off right

07:36.056 --> 07:37.057
now.

07:37.891 --> 07:39.063
Ava,

07:40.226 --> 07:41.796
I sure do hate seeing you here like this.

07:41.895 --> 07:43.238
Doesn't seem right.

07:43.296 --> 07:44.798
Don't feel bad, Johnny.

07:45.932 --> 07:48.412
I would have had
Boyd string you up till I got out

07:48.468 --> 07:50.641
just to watch him skin you like a rabbit.

07:50.737 --> 07:53.081
I guess that's why we're all meeting here,

07:53.840 --> 07:55.842
where ain't any one of us
can pull on the other.

07:55.942 --> 07:58.821
Well, I figured a parley
behind the confines of metal detectors

07:58.912 --> 08:01.119
might keep everybody's mind
on what's important.

08:01.681 --> 08:03.456
And what is so important that you saw fit

08:03.516 --> 08:05.962
to lure me out here to the county jail
on such a beautiful day?

08:06.019 --> 08:07.589
You really got to ask?

08:08.021 --> 08:10.262
After you hit a delivery intended for me.

08:10.924 --> 08:12.995
I don't know what delivery
you're talking about, cousin.

08:13.093 --> 08:14.936
Well, specifics ain't that important.

08:15.195 --> 08:18.938
What's important is the question
of reparations and restitution.

08:29.943 --> 08:32.219
Let us start with how
you are gonna make reparations

08:32.312 --> 08:33.950
for me taking a belly full of buckshot

08:34.047 --> 08:36.027
on account of you
finding Jesus for a minute.

08:36.116 --> 08:40.121
Cousin Johnny, your resentments
do harbour some grain of truth.

08:41.121 --> 08:43.465
But they are far removed
in the history of wrongdoings

08:43.523 --> 08:44.797
that you've perpetrated over...

08:44.858 --> 08:46.895
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah!

08:46.993 --> 08:47.994
Shit.

08:48.628 --> 08:51.837
I just about forgot
how much I hate the sound of your voice.

08:52.132 --> 08:55.204
Using every word in the Webster's
without ever saying a damn thing.

08:55.301 --> 08:57.907
- You want me to get to the point?
- Yeah, 25 words or less.

08:58.004 --> 09:00.541
You tell me why I should give a shit.

09:00.974 --> 09:02.817
How about one word? Money.

09:03.209 --> 09:05.553
Meaning what? You need some?

09:05.745 --> 09:08.692
Well, everybody needs money,
Cousin Johnny.

09:09.816 --> 09:13.559
I'm saying there's a lotto be made

09:14.054 --> 09:17.661
if we can set aside our differences
for a minute.

09:19.993 --> 09:21.199
You've got to be kidding me.

09:21.361 --> 09:24.205
I'm not. I'm serious as the pope, Johnny.

09:25.231 --> 09:28.838
Now, we wouldn't be the first dysfunctional
family to ever make a profit.

09:30.737 --> 09:32.580
Well, now, see, the thing is, Boyd,

09:34.207 --> 09:35.709
I did not come here to see you.

09:36.242 --> 09:37.880
I came hereto see Ava.

09:38.945 --> 09:42.688
And now that I have,
as far as I'm concerned, this meeting is done.

09:49.622 --> 09:51.397
You should have done right by me, cousin.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.796
I was a believer for a while.

09:55.728 --> 09:57.867
When you come to your senses, sweetheart,

09:59.032 --> 10:01.478
you drop me a line. I'll come for you.

10:23.556 --> 10:24.762
Guard.

10:27.660 --> 10:28.661
You on him?

10:29.162 --> 10:31.438
He's cut south. Ain't heading to Lexington.

10:31.498 --> 10:32.738
<i>Stay on him.</i>

10:32.799 --> 10:34.801
Give him plenty of lead.
He pulls off, you pass him up

10:34.901 --> 10:36.312
and wait somewhere he can't see you.

10:36.402 --> 10:38.006
I know how to tail a mark, Boyd.

10:38.104 --> 10:40.311
Well, you ain't never tailed a Crowder before.

10:45.512 --> 10:47.992
Let's just keep those hands
where we can see them.

10:48.081 --> 10:49.424
You got a warrant?

10:50.350 --> 10:51.829
How do you know we're even oops?

10:51.918 --> 10:54.455
- 'Cause I ain't stupid.
- What you got behind the bar there?

10:55.088 --> 10:57.090
- Sawed off .410.
- Good choice.

10:57.924 --> 11:00.962
Now, my partner's gonna
come back there and secure that weapon.

11:01.194 --> 11:03.037
You're gonna back up and let him do so.

11:03.329 --> 11:05.309
Are we all clear on
what's gonna happen next?

11:08.635 --> 11:09.773
.410, huh?

11:12.038 --> 11:13.517
You know' we might have shot you.

11:13.606 --> 11:16.177
You'd shoot a kid holding a baseball bat?
Wouldn't look too good.

11:17.777 --> 11:19.950
- What are y'all doing?
Whatever we want.

11:20.146 --> 11:22.353
Doesn't Wade Messer usually run the bar?

11:22.448 --> 11:24.860
- What do you want with him?
- Just to talk.

11:25.385 --> 11:27.126
- What did you say your name was?
- I didn't.

11:27.453 --> 11:28.454
It's Kendal.

11:29.989 --> 11:31.195
Kendal Crowe?

11:33.059 --> 11:36.040
I guess I missed you
when I was down in your neck.

11:36.129 --> 11:38.473
What brings you up from Florida,
Kendal Crowe?

11:38.531 --> 11:39.805
What business is that of yours?

11:40.066 --> 11:42.546
You got your brother's charm. He around?

11:42.902 --> 11:45.178
- You see him around?
- What about your cousin Dewey?

11:45.238 --> 11:46.979
You best get your eyes checked,
you have to ask.

11:48.007 --> 11:49.247
Messer's number.

11:49.342 --> 11:51.879
History shows only calls made
to one number in Lexington.

11:51.978 --> 11:53.355
Likely Vasquez.

11:53.413 --> 11:55.859
Well, Messer ain't
the brightest bulb in the makeup mirror,

11:55.915 --> 11:58.555
but he'd know better than to
use a government phone around Boyd.

11:58.651 --> 12:00.153
So he's got another phone.

12:02.922 --> 12:04.492
Tell your brother I said hey.

12:22.542 --> 12:24.522
God, I ain't prayed in a while.

12:26.246 --> 12:27.884
It's just... l...

12:31.751 --> 12:35.255
Listen, I ain't fixing to die out here
in the woods like some animal.

12:35.355 --> 12:36.732
You hear me?

12:37.423 --> 12:38.731
That's bullshit.

12:41.728 --> 12:44.038
Jesus, if you help me find him,

12:45.398 --> 12:49.471
once I kill him, I swear, I'll straighten up.

12:51.070 --> 12:54.051
I'll go to church, Sunday school,
whatever you want.

12:56.142 --> 12:59.316
But, God damn it,
I got to get this thing done, you understand?

13:00.780 --> 13:02.760
I ain't ever asked you for shit!

13:02.815 --> 13:04.089
Least you could do...

13:10.890 --> 13:12.301
Well, hallelujah.

13:31.077 --> 13:32.647
That the tree Messer strung you up on,

13:32.745 --> 13:34.520
let Dickie Bennett work you with a fungo bat?

13:34.614 --> 13:35.820
Think Dickie did the stringing.

13:35.915 --> 13:37.588
Messer was more of an accessory.

13:39.919 --> 13:42.160
- What say we go in, poke around?
- He ain't here.

13:42.255 --> 13:43.825
Or he's dead in the back room,

13:43.923 --> 13:46.335
just inches away from
the phone could have saved his life.

13:46.426 --> 13:47.803
That is one possibility.

13:49.128 --> 13:51.438
You don't seem
all that excited about finding our guy.

13:51.497 --> 13:53.340
Well, he did set me up 10 die.

13:53.766 --> 13:56.975
Maybe my investment into his well-being
is a little shaky.

13:57.704 --> 13:59.775
- I want to check the door.
- So check the door.

14:02.875 --> 14:04.183
Dog, dog, dog!

14:10.116 --> 14:11.322
Holy shit.

14:12.652 --> 14:13.687
Did it get you?

14:13.786 --> 14:15.993
No, but I think something
just came between me and my Calvins.

14:16.622 --> 14:18.329
Hey! Hey!

14:18.458 --> 14:20.460
Who the hell are you
pointing your guns at my dog?

14:21.294 --> 14:23.035
US Marshals.
Could you please restrain this animal?

14:24.630 --> 14:25.904
What can I do you for?

14:25.998 --> 14:28.410
Chain it up before
we have to paint the yard with it.

14:30.636 --> 14:31.580
Chelsea!

14:31.671 --> 14:34.208
Come here, baby. That's right. Yeah.

14:34.307 --> 14:35.980
My little chocolate lover.

14:37.310 --> 14:39.381
Y'all welcome to come down now.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.485
- Danny, right? Danny Crowe.
- Same.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.217
You're the one that had that big old mastiff

14:44.317 --> 14:46.092
just about took my leg off in Clewiston.

14:46.185 --> 14:49.325
Yeah. That was Mitzi.
She's one special animal.

14:49.655 --> 14:51.328
Kissing cousin to this one right here.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.337
Ain't that right, baby? Yeah.

14:54.093 --> 14:56.095
Chelsea's got a big set of balls on her.

14:58.097 --> 15:00.338
Hey, buddy, do yourself a favour...

15:01.033 --> 15:03.070
Don't talk about my dog again.

15:05.338 --> 15:07.841
How is it you come to be living
in Wade Messer's house, Danny Crowe?

15:09.675 --> 15:11.780
Well, I'm his roommate now that I landed.

15:12.011 --> 15:13.752
That's a sitcom I'd pay to see.

15:13.846 --> 15:15.257
Well, he ain't here now.

15:15.348 --> 15:19.524
But you boys are more than welcome to take
a look around. I ain't got nothing to hide.

15:19.585 --> 15:22.429
I'm sure little Chelsea here
would love lo show you around.

15:22.522 --> 15:24.866
Ain't that right, girl? That's right. Yeah.

15:28.761 --> 15:30.365
Pleasure! all mine.

16:01.794 --> 16:02.898
Son of a bitch!

16:03.763 --> 16:05.242
Help me.

16:05.932 --> 16:07.809
- Please.
- Don't look at me, man.

16:07.900 --> 16:09.573
I'm sorry, man. Don't look at me.

16:09.902 --> 16:10.937
Help me.

16:13.606 --> 16:14.949
You okay, mister?

16:15.107 --> 16:16.609
You lost? You look pretty bad.

16:17.009 --> 16:18.079
Yeah, I'm lost.

16:18.244 --> 16:20.417
- Don't come any closer.
- Why not?

16:20.680 --> 16:22.284
Well, I got bit by something.

16:22.348 --> 16:23.622
I might be contagious.

16:23.749 --> 16:25.786
I think maybe you got sunstroke, mister.

16:25.852 --> 16:27.627
Just... Just stay there.

16:28.120 --> 16:29.258
Okay?

16:31.457 --> 16:33.164
Oh, my Lord. What has happened to you?

16:33.326 --> 16:34.430
Y'all just...

16:34.494 --> 16:37.338
Y'all just stay there, okay? I mean it.

16:37.530 --> 16:40.170
I know you're confused, honey,
but it's gonna be all right.

16:40.266 --> 16:41.677
We're here to help you.

16:41.767 --> 16:43.838
Vince, clear a spot on the back for him.

16:44.804 --> 16:46.306
All right, all right, all right! I'll come lo you.

16:46.372 --> 16:47.680
I'll come to you, all right?

16:47.773 --> 16:49.446
Just let me... I'm gonna walk down.

16:49.976 --> 16:51.683
Just... I'll come to you, okay?

16:52.311 --> 16:53.813
- Okay.
- Of course, honey.

16:53.946 --> 16:56.449
You just come on down to us.
Just... Easy does it.

16:58.651 --> 17:01.154
- You stuck, mister?
- No, I'm good. I got it.

17:15.968 --> 17:18.073
Help. Help.

17:18.570 --> 17:19.742
Oh, God!

17:20.071 --> 17:22.746
Oh, God, my head! It hurts!

17:22.842 --> 17:24.844
- We got to get him out of here.
- I think I'm gonna faint.

17:24.911 --> 17:26.390
We've got to get him out of here pronto.

17:26.679 --> 17:27.817
He's losing it.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.052
Help me.

17:40.993 --> 17:43.337
Now, let me get this all straight.

17:43.696 --> 17:47.269
We got US Marshals
banging on doors all over town,

17:47.366 --> 17:51.007
plus Dewey and the dipshit
we sent him to kill are both MIA.

17:51.170 --> 17:53.047
Is that about right,
or am I leaving something out?

17:53.105 --> 17:54.516
Well, we are out of Wild Turkey.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.713
Y'all understand how that's bad, right?

17:57.109 --> 18:00.522
What are the federals after
some needledick hillbilly over, anyway?

18:00.580 --> 18:02.287
They ain't. They after me.

18:02.381 --> 18:04.793
This is the same marshal
that put me in Starke.

18:04.884 --> 18:06.363
He got a bone to pick.

18:06.686 --> 18:07.892
So here he is.

18:07.954 --> 18:09.433
Well, you know what I say.

18:09.522 --> 18:12.059
Yeah, Danny, I know what you want to do.
You want to kill him, right?

18:12.124 --> 18:14.468
You want to execute a government official
because what?

18:14.560 --> 18:16.767
He insulted your dumb-ass dog, Chiclet.

18:17.363 --> 18:18.706
Her name is Chelsea.

18:18.965 --> 18:21.571
- If we kill him now, it means we go again.
- Right.

18:21.867 --> 18:23.608
But this time, they follow us forever.

18:23.703 --> 18:25.444
God damn it. I told you

18:25.538 --> 18:26.881
that I should have killed Messer.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.782
And I told you it's Dewey's turn.

18:28.975 --> 18:32.081
I got my reasons,
so let's not waste time and go over it again.

18:32.778 --> 18:33.779
So what you want to do?

18:33.879 --> 18:36.951
I want to find my cousin Dewey and
make sure he took care of business.

18:37.249 --> 18:39.126
And if he didn't,
I'm gonna take care of business,

18:39.218 --> 18:41.129
which may mean taking care of Dewey.

18:42.221 --> 18:44.667
Everybody understand
the gravity of what I'm talking about here?

18:45.391 --> 18:46.495
Yes?

18:47.560 --> 18:49.938
All right, Kendal,
go on and take care of the bar.

18:50.896 --> 18:51.897
Bitch.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.102
We are out of Wild Turkey.

18:53.165 --> 18:54.303
Yeah, I heard as much,

18:54.400 --> 18:57.142
and I'm gonna file that
under "least of our goddamn problems."

18:58.404 --> 18:59.815
You coming?

19:06.145 --> 19:07.783
Something funny, darling?

19:07.847 --> 19:09.417
No. Nothing.

19:09.749 --> 19:11.592
Where we off to this fine afternoon?

19:11.951 --> 19:12.952
Dining hall.

19:13.019 --> 19:14.589
Been eating all right since you processed?

19:14.787 --> 19:17.427
A lot of white girls have
trouble keeping food down.

19:17.490 --> 19:18.594
Get too skinny in here.

19:18.924 --> 19:20.198
It's unbecoming.

19:21.260 --> 19:23.797
What is it we're talking about here exactly?

19:23.963 --> 19:27.103
We're just having a conversation, is all.
I'm Albert, by the way.

19:27.700 --> 19:30.977
Well, Albert, I'm not
feeling much more like conversating.

19:31.604 --> 19:33.174
Maybe I'm just a little peckish.

19:33.272 --> 19:35.775
Yeah, some girls get peckish.

19:35.875 --> 19:39.482
Maybe take to squirrelling away
foodstuffs in their cells, huh?

19:40.046 --> 19:42.549
Help mitigate
those hunger pains in the night.

19:42.648 --> 19:44.958
So you're here to toss the cell?

19:46.385 --> 19:48.626
Well, go on. Do what you got to do.

19:55.895 --> 19:58.569
What were you smirking at when I come in?

19:59.231 --> 20:00.232
Nothing.

20:00.566 --> 20:01.874
Girl, you "nothing" me again,

20:01.967 --> 20:05.744
I will smash your face into that toilet
till there ain't nothing left to recognise.

20:05.838 --> 20:07.317
Now answer my question!

20:08.474 --> 20:12.422
I was thinking,
"Aren't you a little short for a Stormtrooper?"

20:14.413 --> 20:16.256
You're a pretty girl, huh?

20:16.849 --> 20:17.987
Like maybe...

20:18.651 --> 20:22.098
Maybe not like you once was,
but pretty enough.

20:24.990 --> 20:26.230
I give you a compliment.

20:26.325 --> 20:28.532
Don't that get me a "thank you," at least?

20:31.564 --> 20:33.669
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

20:35.034 --> 20:36.775
Now disrobe and bend over.

20:38.037 --> 20:39.846
- What?
- You heard me.

20:41.907 --> 20:43.011
Bullshit!

20:44.910 --> 20:47.356
Good.
Tell me how I'm gonna regret this, huh?

20:47.413 --> 20:48.517
I love it.

20:48.848 --> 20:52.694
Now you disrobe and bend over
or I'm just gonna have to make you.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.754
- Get off of me!
- Officer Fekus?

20:54.854 --> 20:56.856
I said, "Stop resisting."

20:57.356 --> 20:59.734
- We good?
- I said, "Stop resisting."

21:00.059 --> 21:01.265
There a problem in here?

21:03.562 --> 21:05.974
I tripped. I grabbed his arm. My bad.

21:06.532 --> 21:08.534
Need to be careful in here, lady.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.137
This ain't a cotillion.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.878
Let's get you to the dining hall.

21:22.882 --> 21:23.883
He still headed west?

21:23.949 --> 21:25.451
He'll hit Nashville before too long.

21:25.551 --> 21:26.655
I'm gonna need gas soon.

21:26.752 --> 21:27.753
<i>Well, then, so will he.</i>

21:27.820 --> 21:30.494
Now, he stops, you stop somewhere close

21:30.589 --> 21:32.762
and use that can I put in the back.

21:35.594 --> 21:37.631
Just don't let him out of your sight.

21:37.730 --> 21:39.300
Raylan Givens.

21:39.598 --> 21:42.101
Well, I'm afraid you caught us
with our closed sign up.

21:42.735 --> 21:46.410
Now, I'd offer to re-open,
but you've yet to spend a dollar in my bar.

21:47.072 --> 21:50.417
Allow me a minute
to collect my wits such to reply.

21:50.743 --> 21:54.589
I'm overcome trying to factor
how many weapons you're armed with.

21:54.780 --> 21:55.952
Well, not armed as such.

21:56.015 --> 21:58.859
Just transporting goods
from point A to point B,

21:58.951 --> 22:02.797
i.e., this legally procured hunting implement
out to the shed for safekeeping.

22:02.922 --> 22:04.265
You know Deputy Gutterson.

22:04.924 --> 22:07.165
Well, I believe we have a friend in common.

22:07.259 --> 22:09.000
Or should I say "had"?

22:09.261 --> 22:10.672
I'm not sure I'd call him a friend.

22:10.763 --> 22:12.333
Well, I'm not sure he would, either.

22:12.965 --> 22:14.603
Felon carrying a firearm.

22:14.967 --> 22:18.107
Could violate you,
put the wheels in motion for charges.

22:18.504 --> 22:21.178
Suppose there'd be some satisfaction,

22:21.273 --> 22:24.447
but, at the moment,
we have a more pressing concern.

22:26.645 --> 22:29.558
I understand Wade Messer
worked principally for you.

22:29.648 --> 22:33.027
Well, your use of the past tense
gives me some sense of foreboding.

22:33.118 --> 22:35.997
Last day or so,
the man's wandered some off the radar.

22:36.355 --> 22:40.735
And what leads you to surmise he has
any continued affiliation with me?

22:40.893 --> 22:44.238
Well, I know he was informing
our of floe on your activities,

22:44.363 --> 22:47.810
and I know you know that
because you've been feeding him bullshit.

22:47.900 --> 22:52.371
Why, Raylan Givens,
I have no idea what it is you're implying.

22:52.471 --> 22:55.680
You fed Messer bullshit
so he'd feed the same bullshit to the AUSA,

22:55.808 --> 22:58.152
and they could go on thinking
he's a viable Cl.

22:58.210 --> 23:01.214
While no doubt using him
to strip every dime you could out of Audry's.

23:01.313 --> 23:03.759
And now that their
confidential informant's gone missing...

23:04.016 --> 23:07.657
Horrible thought, but just suppose
the man turns up dead somewhere.

23:08.654 --> 23:13.000
Absent any clear leads otherwise,
it makes you look very shiny as a suspect.

23:13.058 --> 23:14.401
Really kind of the only suspect.

23:14.493 --> 23:17.565
And suppose he just went fishing.

23:17.663 --> 23:18.903
You think that's what happened?

23:18.998 --> 23:22.207
Well, I don't know because
he didn't invite me on his fishing trip.

23:22.735 --> 23:23.873
Did you try calling him?

23:23.936 --> 23:26.007
We would, but we found
his phone at Audry's.

23:26.171 --> 23:30.176
Smart criminal might
consider giving his crew a burner phone,

23:30.242 --> 23:34.088
one only the boss knows the number to,
thereby minimising exposure.

23:34.179 --> 23:36.420
Raylan Givens, are you flattering me?

23:36.515 --> 23:37.926
Give us the number to his burner,

23:38.017 --> 23:40.623
and let's see if he's got it with him
on his fishing trip.

23:48.560 --> 23:52.372
Well, now that I have
fully cooperated with law enforcement,

23:52.631 --> 23:54.372
am I free to go?

23:55.200 --> 23:58.477
Tim, you mind sticking around,
keeping Boyd company a minute?

23:58.570 --> 24:00.072
Well, I was hoping.

24:01.573 --> 24:02.574
Give me my pen.

24:03.909 --> 24:04.944
Where you going?

24:05.044 --> 24:07.320
Find out whether
what you gave us is bullshit.

24:07.880 --> 24:09.882
I just texted you a number for GPS.

24:10.115 --> 24:11.458
Yep. Okay.

24:13.986 --> 24:15.260
- Mullen.
- <i>Art...</i>

24:15.587 --> 24:16.657
It's Ed.

24:16.755 --> 24:17.825
Listen, you still interested in

24:17.923 --> 24:19.459
what went down the night
Nicky Augustine was murdered?

24:19.558 --> 24:20.502
<i>Yeah.</i>

24:20.592 --> 24:21.969
You got a little tidbit for me?

24:22.061 --> 24:24.098
- I've got more than a tidbit.
- Really?

24:25.331 --> 24:26.469
Well, what do you know?

24:27.166 --> 24:29.407
I think it's best
if you come up to Detroit tonight.

24:30.002 --> 24:31.413
All right.

24:32.071 --> 24:34.483
- Let me see if I can get up there tonight.
- All right.

24:43.015 --> 24:44.494
- Nothing?
- No.

24:44.583 --> 24:45.960
Well, then, we keep looking.

24:46.285 --> 24:49.789
Meantime, let's get something behind the bar
with a little bit more pop,

24:49.855 --> 24:53.803
so next time baby brother has something
to defend himself with other than his dick?

24:54.193 --> 24:55.501
How about a little sawed-off shotty?

24:55.594 --> 24:57.267
- Yeah, that'd do her.
- Yeah.

24:58.464 --> 24:59.602
Dewey.

25:00.632 --> 25:02.111
Hey, man, where you at?

25:02.501 --> 25:04.447
Hey... What? Shit...

25:04.603 --> 25:06.014
Are you goddamn crying?

25:06.772 --> 25:08.774
Okay, just sit tight, son.

25:08.841 --> 25:10.616
Yeah, I'm coming to get you.

25:10.976 --> 25:14.287
Yeah. I'm gonna get this all straightened out.

25:15.781 --> 25:18.625
The owner hadn't seen him, and he called
the night lady, she hadn't either.

25:18.684 --> 25:20.721
You sure this is where GPS pings to?

25:20.819 --> 25:22.355
It's pretty deserted.

25:23.322 --> 25:25.029
No, I think I'll...

25:26.859 --> 25:28.463
You know what? Never mind.

25:30.029 --> 25:31.531
I think I might have found him.

25:32.498 --> 25:35.536
Well, see, it's all 'cause
Messer brought this little Webelo shovel.

25:35.634 --> 25:37.545
- A what?
- A Webelo shovel. It's like a...

25:37.636 --> 25:40.014
Dewey, stop, man. I can't even take it.

25:40.072 --> 25:43.349
You have any idea at all where he's at now?

25:43.475 --> 25:45.682
Yeah, well, we come down this ATV trail

25:46.211 --> 25:48.885
next to this little, like, bed-and-breakfast.

25:48.981 --> 25:50.426
Now, he ain't gonna be far

25:50.516 --> 25:52.996
'cause he was just about dead
when I come up on him.

25:56.088 --> 25:57.499
You believe me. Right, Darryl?

25:58.590 --> 26:00.228
I mean, the man was dead.

26:00.325 --> 26:01.770
- I don't know how...
- How what?

26:01.860 --> 26:04.898
How a dead man got up
and walked off into the woods?

26:05.164 --> 26:07.269
I'm having a little trouble
with that one, cousin.

26:09.334 --> 26:10.438
So what happens now?

26:10.736 --> 26:12.841
Go up there. We're gonna find him.

26:13.005 --> 26:15.281
And if need be, you're gonna finish the job.

26:17.443 --> 26:19.787
What happens if we don't find him?

26:20.379 --> 26:23.258
Well, that's a whole other
situation, then, ain't it?

26:29.555 --> 26:30.761
Holy shit.

26:38.797 --> 26:41.209
Looks like your problem
got took care of on its own.

26:41.767 --> 26:43.246
Lucky for you, cousin.

26:45.704 --> 26:47.149
Lucky for you, boy.

27:03.922 --> 27:05.265
You want to challenge?

27:06.725 --> 27:08.932
Did you find everything
you were looking for out there, Raylan?

27:08.994 --> 27:11.668
If everything includes Wade Messer
with a couple of bullet holes in him,

27:11.763 --> 27:12.833
I supposed I did.

27:12.931 --> 27:13.966
He's dead?

27:14.066 --> 27:16.740
Little B&B on Route 3
up in the woods some beyond.

27:17.069 --> 27:18.446
Looks like he took a couple pops,

27:18.504 --> 27:21.644
then wandered around like a chicken
with its head out off through the woods.

27:21.740 --> 27:23.413
Well, I'm genuinely sorry to hear that.

27:23.842 --> 27:25.412
Well, I'll be on my way.

27:25.577 --> 27:27.579
Where is it you're in
such a hurry to get to, Boyd?

27:27.679 --> 27:30.455
My life, Raylan, which, no of fence,
the less you're a part of, the better.

27:32.484 --> 27:34.486
What, you're still thinking
you're gonna pin this on me?

27:34.653 --> 27:36.633
I don't know. Tim, what do you think?

27:36.688 --> 27:39.328
History of violence,
in a hurry somewhere with a gun,

27:39.424 --> 27:41.768
the victim was a Cl against him,

27:41.827 --> 27:43.329
I say we let him go.

27:43.428 --> 27:44.634
Hold on a second.

27:44.696 --> 27:46.198
I'm the one who volunteered
the very information

27:46.298 --> 27:48.005
that led you to the man's body.

27:48.267 --> 27:49.644
Now, I am no legal scholar,

27:49.701 --> 27:52.807
but I believe I satisfied
the writ of habeas corpus of my own volition.

27:52.971 --> 27:55.508
Boyd, if we thought that you did it,

27:55.607 --> 27:56.984
you'd be in a holding cell already,

27:57.042 --> 27:59.352
and a happier thought I can scarcely conjure.

27:59.645 --> 28:03.855
Well, if the Crowes have alighted on the wire
as your friend here says,

28:03.949 --> 28:06.793
they are your problem, Raylan. Not me.

28:16.028 --> 28:17.666
Got another one of them?

28:19.164 --> 28:21.075
Never took you for a smoker, Crane.

28:22.134 --> 28:23.738
Been that kind of day, I guess.

28:24.136 --> 28:25.706
It's always that kind of day at this place.

28:26.538 --> 28:29.382
Enough to make me want to
take a bath in hand sanitiser.

28:38.850 --> 28:41.763
That inmate from before,
little blond piece of ass.

28:42.421 --> 28:45.231
Can't tell which way she swings, though.
Matter of time.

28:45.324 --> 28:46.997
Yeah, here's the thing.

28:52.531 --> 28:54.442
She's protected, you stupid shit.

28:54.666 --> 28:55.736
You can't see that?

28:58.103 --> 29:01.175
Maybe this eyeball ain't
any use to you any more.

29:01.506 --> 29:02.507
No, please.

29:02.874 --> 29:05.218
Never again. Understand?

29:06.345 --> 29:07.346
Say it.

29:07.613 --> 29:09.115
Never again. Never again.

29:15.120 --> 29:17.031
You really do have a nice smile.
You know that?

29:32.137 --> 29:34.981
How long are you aiming
to keep me locked up like this?

29:35.374 --> 29:38.116
Till your dumb ass
sobers up and starts acting right.

29:38.210 --> 29:40.087
You can't keep me in here, Darryl.

29:40.145 --> 29:42.716
This is false imprisonment or some shit.

29:42.914 --> 29:44.484
So, what, you gonna call the law on me?

29:44.583 --> 29:47.826
Well, supposing I did,
you son of a bitch, what then?

29:49.054 --> 29:51.557
All that shit you made me do,

29:51.623 --> 29:54.001
dragging Messer into the woods to kill him...

29:54.126 --> 29:56.003
Why'd you make me do that, huh?

29:56.128 --> 29:58.074
- Why?
- Hey! Hey!

29:58.930 --> 30:00.910
You about done with your little hissy fit?

30:02.567 --> 30:03.739
Can we talk?

30:04.169 --> 30:05.477
Why did you make me do that?

30:05.570 --> 30:06.810
I'll tell you why.

30:07.673 --> 30:09.584
Sol know you a damn Crowe.

30:10.242 --> 30:11.414
You're one of us.

30:12.477 --> 30:14.514
- I ain't one of you.
- You ain't?

30:16.348 --> 30:19.454
So go on and run away
like a full-blown bitch.

30:19.518 --> 30:20.519
Go ahead.

30:21.420 --> 30:22.364
But I'll tell you what.

30:22.454 --> 30:24.764
You get out in the world
and take to running your mouth

30:24.856 --> 30:27.996
about your kin and all the bad shit we done,

30:29.094 --> 30:32.541
just remember which one of us
pulled that trigger on Messer.

30:32.931 --> 30:34.604
Yeah, big man.

30:35.267 --> 30:37.372
That was all you, boy.

30:38.303 --> 30:39.611
All you.

30:40.706 --> 30:41.946
Or...

30:43.108 --> 30:46.021
You can take the plunge, stay with family.

30:47.112 --> 30:49.558
Be a part of what
the Crowes are building here.

30:50.649 --> 30:53.061
Reap the benefits of that good loyalty.

30:54.286 --> 30:56.357
Sounds like you're selling me tyres.

30:56.488 --> 30:57.990
Nah...

30:58.290 --> 31:00.361
I'm selling you a life, Dewey Crowe.

31:01.626 --> 31:03.503
You just got to make a choice.

31:09.067 --> 31:11.980
Well, that explains
why my cousin's got his swagger back.

31:12.671 --> 31:14.742
Balls to carry out a hit that size.

31:14.840 --> 31:16.046
Who is it?

31:16.975 --> 31:19.148
You ever heard of
Rodney "Hot Rod" Dunham?

31:19.678 --> 31:20.679
Shit.

31:20.746 --> 31:22.157
"Shit" is right.

31:22.814 --> 31:24.760
But you know what they say...

31:25.083 --> 31:27.996
The bigger they are, the harder they fall.

31:29.087 --> 31:30.259
So what?

31:30.822 --> 31:31.823
We doing this now?

31:33.859 --> 31:35.497
Not tonight.

31:36.361 --> 31:37.931
You gonna cut down a tree that size,

31:38.029 --> 31:40.441
you need to make sure
you bring a very big saw.

31:41.199 --> 31:42.337
But soon.

31:43.902 --> 31:46.007
Real goddamn soon.

31:51.176 --> 31:55.090
Great, great, great. All that checks out.
Surprisingly.

31:55.447 --> 31:58.053
Hey. Got a slug from the body, .32.

31:58.116 --> 31:59.527
Wandered all over the mountain,

31:59.584 --> 32:01.222
dogs tracked where it could have went down,

32:01.286 --> 32:02.526
but it had already been cleaned up.

32:02.587 --> 32:05.363
All they found was the head
of some sort of camp shovel.

32:06.191 --> 32:07.431
It was the Crowes.

32:07.526 --> 32:11.133
I don't know which one, but my money's
either on Danny or the Haitian.

32:11.430 --> 32:14.775
Well, KSP brought them in one and all for
questioning, and their stories hold up.

32:14.866 --> 32:18.109
Plenty of time to get the narrative straight
with me poking around all the day of.

32:18.203 --> 32:19.944
Yeah, you know,
my office likes things simple,

32:20.038 --> 32:22.985
and simple is Cl informs on a crime boss,

32:23.074 --> 32:24.144
turns up dead,

32:24.242 --> 32:27.052
said CI is likely to have been
killed by said crime boss.

32:28.480 --> 32:29.652
What? That's funny?

32:29.948 --> 32:32.952
What's funny is you calling
Boyd Crowder a crime boss.

32:33.051 --> 32:34.655
You know what's funny to me?

32:34.753 --> 32:36.790
Your continuing insistence that he's not.

32:36.888 --> 32:39.960
Hey, I wish it was Boyd.
I'd put the cuffs on him myself.

32:40.058 --> 32:43.562
But you want justice for Wade Messer,
start with the Crowes.

32:43.628 --> 32:44.629
Interesting.

32:44.896 --> 32:47.740
The same Crowes that you had occasion to
visit down in Hendry county, Florida?

32:47.799 --> 32:48.834
Where I was sent.

32:48.934 --> 32:52.780
And lo these few weeks later,
here they are in Kentucky.

32:53.472 --> 32:55.474
What? Did y'all carpool up together?

32:57.809 --> 32:59.447
Nice work tracking Messer, though.

32:59.511 --> 33:01.991
You're right. Art probably should have
told you he was our CI.

33:02.080 --> 33:03.320
Probably.

33:03.648 --> 33:04.820
Hey. Where is Art?

33:11.122 --> 33:12.863
Detroit PD picked him up
on a missing license plate.

33:12.958 --> 33:14.665
He popped with NCIC.

33:14.759 --> 33:18.138
It turns out he's a reasonable-sized fish.
Some Canadian drug thing.

33:18.196 --> 33:19.334
What's his angle?

33:19.531 --> 33:21.340
He'd sell his own dick in a gift box

33:21.433 --> 33:24.277
for a ride back across the river
to the Queen's whatever.

33:25.203 --> 33:27.376
Figured you'd want to
hear what he's offering.

33:28.039 --> 33:29.040
Thanks.

33:29.941 --> 33:30.942
Good luck.

33:33.512 --> 33:34.957
You the Kentucky guy?

33:35.614 --> 33:38.458
- I'm the Kentucky guy.
- The bluegrass state.

33:39.684 --> 33:40.856
Never been.

33:40.952 --> 33:44.024
Not sure you're gonna get the chance,
looking at your jacket.

33:44.122 --> 33:45.658
Well, it's my loss, I'm sure.

33:47.626 --> 33:48.832
So what do you want to know?

33:49.060 --> 33:52.303
<i>I want to know what happened
on the tarmac outside of Lexington</i>

33:52.364 --> 33:54.037
the night Nicky Augustine was killed.

33:54.132 --> 33:57.011
Look, like I told the last guy, it's all hearsay.

33:57.235 --> 33:58.305
I don't care.

33:59.471 --> 34:04.216
Well, in my dealings with the late, great
psycho shithead Sammy Tonin,

34:04.342 --> 34:08.313
he told me a couple times that he had
a Kentucky lawman in his pocket,

34:08.380 --> 34:12.054
<i>or a lawman in Kentucky, one of the two.
And that he was there</i>

34:12.150 --> 34:14.061
the night he took out Nicky Augustine.

34:17.188 --> 34:18.188
Continue.

34:18.822 --> 34:19.824
That's all.

34:20.492 --> 34:21.835
That's all?

34:23.061 --> 34:24.505
<i>Well, it's up to Chief Kirkland,</i>

34:24.563 --> 34:27.840
<i>but I don't think that's gonna get you back
up north to your free healthcare.</i>

34:27.899 --> 34:31.176
Okay, look, if you want the full story,

34:32.003 --> 34:33.744
you have to talk to Picker.

34:34.406 --> 34:37.751
He was Sammy's right-hand man until...
Well, until he killed him.

34:38.777 --> 34:39.755
Picker?

34:39.844 --> 34:43.018
Yeah, I don't know if that's
a first name, last name, or nom de guerre.

34:43.380 --> 34:44.451
Is he still around here?

34:45.050 --> 34:46.290
Your lucky day.

34:47.351 --> 34:51.766
I think out of fear of what evil henchmen
Theo Tonin might still have hanging around,

34:51.856 --> 34:56.965
he's laying low in your neck of the woods
with a man named Wynn Duffy.

35:06.204 --> 35:08.650
Intercoms all screwed up.
I didn't hear a thing.

35:11.209 --> 35:13.416
So you gonna send him
back across the riven?

35:13.478 --> 35:16.823
Well, might as well. We got too many
damn Canadians in this country.

35:16.915 --> 35:18.895
Justin Bieber, Celine Dion...

35:19.551 --> 35:20.825
Steve Nash.

35:21.586 --> 35:22.963
Take care, Art.

35:29.227 --> 35:30.228
You good?

35:31.963 --> 35:33.237
I'm good.

35:35.467 --> 35:36.502
That was just...

35:36.601 --> 35:38.638
Think maybe I was working
some stuff out on you, there.

35:38.737 --> 35:40.080
I'm not complaining.

35:47.412 --> 35:48.789
You staying?

35:49.914 --> 35:52.417
- You want me to stay?
- Do whatever you want.

35:53.752 --> 35:54.958
All right.

35:56.755 --> 35:58.826
- You should go.
- Okay.

36:00.091 --> 36:01.968
- You mean now?
- If you're going.

36:03.762 --> 36:05.764
Did I miss a part of the conversation?

36:06.264 --> 36:08.642
Where I said something off-colour?

36:09.534 --> 36:12.140
- I'm doing a thing, aren't I?
- Maybe.

36:16.341 --> 36:18.116
There's this kid. He's eight.

36:18.643 --> 36:20.213
Mom's run off years ago,

36:20.311 --> 36:23.019
so dad's taken to
chaining him up in the garage.

36:23.114 --> 36:25.355
He's got this bucket to do his business in.

36:26.017 --> 36:29.157
Sometimes he's not checked on for days,
so I pull him out of there.

36:30.689 --> 36:34.330
He's barely speaking English.
He's blinking in the sunlight

36:34.392 --> 36:38.898
like something living in a cave,
which I suppose he was.

36:39.030 --> 36:40.407
This is today?

36:40.832 --> 36:42.470
Got the law and all.

36:43.635 --> 36:45.581
Kid hadn't eaten in God knows when.

36:45.704 --> 36:49.311
He was like this other species,
like something pitiful.

36:51.076 --> 36:53.920
Anyway, I'm walking back to the car,

36:54.012 --> 36:56.390
and daddy comes at me with a tyre iron

36:56.481 --> 36:59.087
saying there's no way
I'm gonna break up his family.

36:59.684 --> 37:01.493
Saying that boy's all he's got.

37:03.488 --> 37:06.765
He would've beat me to death
if the police wasn't there...

37:09.394 --> 37:10.668
All 'cause...

37:11.830 --> 37:14.538
This boy he had chained to a radiator...

37:15.266 --> 37:17.678
Worse than you treat your worst enemy...

37:19.537 --> 37:20.538
Family.

37:21.606 --> 37:23.176
Hey, come here.

37:24.275 --> 37:25.515
You staying?

37:25.877 --> 37:28.187
Yeah, I'm staying.

37:42.127 --> 37:44.368
Christ, this smells, don't it?

37:44.929 --> 37:46.875
You ought to be used to it by now.

37:48.900 --> 37:51.642
What is this? What's this skin?

37:52.904 --> 37:54.577
It's some kind of racial thing.

37:55.974 --> 37:57.544
You think he's gonna turn up?

37:58.209 --> 37:59.779
Nah. He's gone.

38:00.311 --> 38:03.884
My guess is he's gonna wind up being the
subject of some kind of myth or folklore.

38:03.948 --> 38:06.258
You know, "What the hell ever
happened to Boyd Crowder?"

38:06.317 --> 38:07.455
That'll be that.

38:07.952 --> 38:10.990
Mooney, I think you can
guarantee come next election,

38:11.089 --> 38:13.729
you will no longer be "acting" sheriff.

38:14.125 --> 38:16.230
- Thank you, sir.
- That'll be all.

38:19.063 --> 38:21.737
Mara, honey, when's dinner gonna be ready?

38:22.400 --> 38:24.573
I sure did miss your cooking in the hospital.

38:24.836 --> 38:26.474
Just a few more minutes.

38:28.673 --> 38:29.811
Lee...

38:30.909 --> 38:33.150
Now that Boyd's dead,

38:33.912 --> 38:36.358
you still want to proceed with
the case against Ava Crowder?

38:36.447 --> 38:38.188
Hell yes' I want to pursue it.

38:38.850 --> 38:41.524
That trash deserves
every second she gets inside.

38:41.920 --> 38:44.992
She already killed her own husband
and walked on that.

38:46.357 --> 38:47.495
Good riddance.

38:47.792 --> 38:48.793
Okay.

38:54.132 --> 38:55.873
Party's over, revellers.

38:56.301 --> 38:59.111
Leave your drinks where they are.
Get the hell out.

38:59.437 --> 39:00.973
- Us, too?
- Everybody.

39:01.873 --> 39:03.045
Everybody

39:03.942 --> 39:04.943
except you.

39:07.512 --> 39:10.618
Looks like you lost some of that
Everglades tan since you landed.

39:10.682 --> 39:12.787
Come up in hereto cause trouble?

39:13.952 --> 39:17.331
Swinging around
that big, old federal dick of yours, huh?

39:17.789 --> 39:18.859
Is that what you come to do?

39:18.957 --> 39:21.836
Or you come to find out about
our day manager who's gone missing?

39:22.360 --> 39:25.307
'Cause we done talked
to the state's bacon about that already.

39:25.363 --> 39:27.172
All your stories in lock step.

39:27.232 --> 39:28.506
Guess you've had some practise.

39:28.566 --> 39:30.671
Yeah, we had a whole lot of practise.

39:30.735 --> 39:32.510
I still can't figure out why you killed him.

39:33.071 --> 39:35.517
Whether it was 'cause he was skimming
or just in your way.

39:36.474 --> 39:39.318
Maybe it was 'cause you knew he was a CI.
That's a possibility.

39:39.677 --> 39:41.384
Unless he was informing on us,

39:41.479 --> 39:42.981
and I don't see how he could be,

39:43.047 --> 39:45.653
considering we ain't
got nothing to inform on.

39:46.517 --> 39:48.326
Them reasons don't mean nothing to us.

39:48.386 --> 39:49.660
True. Okay.

39:49.988 --> 39:52.696
Irrespective why you killed Messer,
here's the deal.

39:53.057 --> 39:54.593
You got to leave this place.

39:55.360 --> 39:58.569
You and your people back to Florida,
wherever will have you, I don't care,

39:58.663 --> 40:00.370
but you can't stay here. You understand?

40:04.168 --> 40:07.012
Marshal, you know good and well
ain't nobody going nowhere.

40:07.405 --> 40:09.715
Matter of fact,
we came up hereto lay down roots.

40:10.208 --> 40:12.620
'Sides, if you had
good enough reason to run us out of here,

40:12.710 --> 40:14.553
you'd have done it already. Ain't that right?

40:14.612 --> 40:17.752
Just remember, so when later you're
regretting the decision you made,

40:17.849 --> 40:19.260
remember I gave you the chance.

40:19.617 --> 40:21.790
I'll tie a string around my finger, all right?

40:22.020 --> 40:25.593
Yeah, I'll just be collecting what I came for
and be on my way.

40:25.690 --> 40:27.692
- Yeah' what you came for?
- Kendal Crowe.

40:28.693 --> 40:30.104
You're coming with me.

40:30.194 --> 40:32.606
Whoa, whoa. Is that supposed to be funny?

40:32.697 --> 40:34.938
Not so much funny ha-ha as funny odd.

40:35.466 --> 40:37.537
Meaning when I was in here the other day,

40:37.602 --> 40:41.607
I found it odd that you had a minor
behind the bar in a house of ill repute.

40:42.273 --> 40:43.616
Kendal?

40:44.375 --> 40:47.322
Man, that boy done
seen shit you and I can't imagine.

40:47.578 --> 40:49.717
Well, yet here I am

40:50.548 --> 40:54.997
with a mandate to remove
the minor Kendal Crowe into state's custody.

40:55.253 --> 40:57.130
Man, don't nobody care about that bullshit.

40:57.221 --> 41:00.395
It's for the safety and well-being of the child.
You understand.

41:00.892 --> 41:02.462
Time to go. Get what you need.

41:02.560 --> 41:05.803
Toothbrush would be good, but CPS will
provide anything else, within bounds.

41:05.897 --> 41:07.433
Kendal, you stay right there.

41:08.232 --> 41:11.236
He'll leave out of here
over my dead, white body.

41:12.904 --> 41:15.077
Well, I may just be able to arrange that.

41:15.974 --> 41:18.511
Tell your brother he takes
any step further out of my line of sight,

41:18.609 --> 41:20.611
that'll be the last step he ever takes.

41:20.678 --> 41:23.124
Talking like that
means you don't know my brother Danny.

41:25.416 --> 41:27.760
You sure this is how you
want it to go down, Darryl?

41:28.252 --> 41:30.357
Not for me to say, but I would encourage you

41:30.455 --> 41:33.334
to consider what happens
after what happens next.

41:33.424 --> 41:35.927
I considered it, and I don't give a shit.

41:36.594 --> 41:38.505
You ain't taking my baby brother.

41:40.098 --> 41:43.045
This is your last chance
to walk up out of here alive.

41:44.168 --> 41:45.647
It's decided, then.

41:46.204 --> 41:47.205
- I'll go.
- Kendal, you ain't going...

41:47.305 --> 41:49.478
No, Darryl, I'll go.

41:52.343 --> 41:53.788
You know what to do.

41:56.514 --> 41:58.289
Ain't up to me' but I say we go.

42:19.137 --> 42:20.138
This is it?

42:20.805 --> 42:23.308
Three from the night
you and Jimmy almost got hit.

42:23.374 --> 42:25.547
Rest from the night they hit the shipment.
