Oh!

01:23.800 --> 01:26.235
Waiting for Walter?
Mrs. McCallam.

01:26.440 --> 01:29.399
He's running a little late,
and I just couldn't bear
the thought of you

01:29.600 --> 01:32.115
sitting here all alone,
so I came to keep you company.

01:32.320 --> 01:34.471
Well, I'm not waiting for Walter.
Save it.

01:34.680 --> 01:37.036
Waiter, a martini.

01:37.240 --> 01:38.754
I want you to stop seeing him.

Uh, the waiter?

No. Walter.

Oh, I don't know
what you're talking about.

You and my husband.

The Ritz Hotel in Hartford,

Not New Haven.
We were never in...
Never in New Haven.

01:59.640 --> 02:02.997
All right, now that we've
gotten that out of the way,
I want you to stop seeing him.

02:03.200 --> 02:04.919
No, I won't.
We love each other.

02:05.120 --> 02:08.157
Oh, please. Love?
Walter doesn't love anyone.

02:08.360 --> 02:12.434
Walter is the most totally
self-absorbed person in the world.

02:12.640 --> 02:15.838
We have a 7-year-old daughter,
Abigail. Walter calls her Amanda.

02:16.080 --> 02:18.515
Seven years and he still
doesn't know her name.

02:18.720 --> 02:19.915
Thank you.

02:20.120 --> 02:25.195
So do you bow out gracefully,
or do I tell Walter to dump you?

02:25.400 --> 02:28.757
Are you kidding?
Walter would never dump me.

02:37.600 --> 02:38.750
Guess you spotted me.

02:41.120 --> 02:42.998
We were just talking about you.

02:43.200 --> 02:44.236
Small world.

02:44.440 --> 02:47.201
Imagine the three of us
running into each other
in the same restaurant.

02:47.280 --> 02:48.280
Don't bother, Walter.

02:48.480 --> 02:50.312
Bother? It's no bother.
It's no bother at all.

02:50.520 --> 02:51.954
She knows, darling.
She knows?

02:53.480 --> 02:54.834
Ah.

02:55.480 --> 02:59.394
Yes. And I was just telling Eunice
that if you had to make a choice

02:59.600 --> 03:01.478
between the two of us,
I know you'd choose me.

03:01.680 --> 03:04.957
You see, I took out a small
insurance policy, a detective,

03:05.160 --> 03:08.153
who, among other things,
discovered that you were
being blackmailed.

03:08.400 --> 03:12.235
I paid the blackmailer
and bought the most
interesting set of pictures.

03:12.440 --> 03:14.281
By the way, darling,
you don't photograph well.

03:15.640 --> 03:18.712
Now, should you ever
see her again,

03:18.920 --> 03:22.436
I will give those negatives
to the press.

03:23.240 --> 03:25.709
You'd do that?
I mean, you'd ruin my career?

03:25.920 --> 03:26.920
That's right.

03:27.080 --> 03:29.470
You don't need a career,
darling. I'll support us.

03:29.680 --> 03:31.751
You'd see to it that I never
held any office again?

03:31.960 --> 03:33.713
Correct.
We could go away.

03:33.920 --> 03:35.718
No money, no job, no nothing?

03:35.960 --> 03:37.713

He had to come.

What happened?

04:28.520 --> 04:32.036
Burt's missing.
They checked all the rooms
at bedtime and he wasn't there.

04:32.240 --> 04:34.516
He never was, if you know
what I mean. Ha-ha-ha!

04:35.080 --> 04:36.753
No, Mom, Mom.

04:38.720 --> 04:40.234
How long has he been gone?

04:40.440 --> 04:43.353
Hours. It's all my fault.
I feel so awful.

he never comes home?

Back to your rooms.

05:08.040 --> 05:10.111
We're just visiting.
You're visiting?

05:10.320 --> 05:12.994
Two men attack a wooden doll
while the third screams?

05:13.200 --> 05:14.200
Nice try.

05:14.400 --> 05:15.720
See, you don't understand.

05:15.920 --> 05:18.560
Bob here was saying
some really nasty things.

05:18.760 --> 05:20.274
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.590
Oh, I see.

05:24.800 --> 05:27.190
The doll said something nasty,

05:27.400 --> 05:29.995
so you wanted to kill it.

You'll have to leave.

You see, we're waiting
for my husband. He ran away.

05:46.600 --> 05:48.353
I don't blame him.

05:49.400 --> 05:50.914
Keep the noise down.

05:51.120 --> 05:54.397
And try and set an example
for the patients.

That's okay, Dan.

06:20.440 --> 06:22.671
Hey, Mare, how are you doing...?

06:25.720 --> 06:27.552
Where were you?
We were so worried.

06:27.760 --> 06:29.831
I didn't do anything.
Yeah, are you all right?

06:43.280 --> 06:44.680

06:44.880 --> 06:48.476
Burt, is it so awful here?
Do you hate it that much?

06:48.680 --> 06:50.911
No, no, no, Mary.
It's not awful at all.

06:51.120 --> 06:53.112
It's very nice here
and I'm getting better.

06:53.320 --> 06:55.551
I really am. I'm getting...
I'm getting better.

06:55.760 --> 06:57.319
Then what is it?

06:57.520 --> 07:02.834
You see, Mare, we talk a lot here
and we tell our secrets, you know.

07:03.040 --> 07:05.509
And at first I thought,
"Hey, forget about it."

07:05.720 --> 07:07.279
Nobody's gonna hear my secrets,

07:07.480 --> 07:09.517
because I got some
very weird secrets.

07:09.720 --> 07:13.111
That was until I heard
their secrets.

07:13.320 --> 07:14.436
Worse.

07:14.640 --> 07:16.597
They're mostly the same.

07:16.800 --> 07:20.032
See, we all have
the same secrets.

07:20.520 --> 07:22.432
I mean, they come out
a little different,

07:22.640 --> 07:26.270
and I don't know,
maybe there are one or two here

07:26.480 --> 07:29.598
who, frankly, are a little more creative
in the way they look at the world,

07:29.800 --> 07:32.440
like chicken man, for instance,
but, essentially...

07:33.960 --> 07:35.189
Chicken man?

07:35.400 --> 07:40.316
Yeah. When things get rough,
he becomes a chicken.

07:41.160 --> 07:42.355
Oh.

07:42.560 --> 07:44.358
When things get too
rough with me, I...

07:44.560 --> 07:46.074
Then disappear and...

07:46.280 --> 07:48.840
You know, Harold wears hats,
some people drink a lot,

07:49.040 --> 07:50.997
others sleep,
and, you know, and...

07:51.640 --> 07:54.360
See, I mean, we all have
our own ways

07:54.560 --> 07:56.711
of stepping back
when things get too rough.

07:56.920 --> 08:00.357
In that way, Mare,
we're all the same.

08:00.560 --> 08:02.916
I eat.
Yeah.

08:03.520 --> 08:05.716
See, but then I realised
that I had one secret

08:05.920 --> 08:08.230
that nobody else had,
and unless I told them the secret,

08:08.440 --> 08:09.874
I couldn't really get better.

08:10.080 --> 08:12.834
And unless I told you the secret,
I couldn't come home.

08:13.040 --> 08:17.080
See, because, Mary,
I can't live with you and love you

08:17.800 --> 08:19.234
and keep the secret from you.

08:19.440 --> 08:21.193
So tell me, darling.
Tell me the secret.

08:21.400 --> 08:23.073
I can't, Mary.
That's why I ran away.

08:23.280 --> 08:26.671
Because I realised I can't tell you
the secret, so I can't go home.

08:27.680 --> 08:30.957
Then I thought,
"I can't tell the secret here,
so I can't stay here."

08:31.160 --> 08:33.072
So I ran away,

08:33.280 --> 08:36.159
and I roamed around the city
all night in the subway.

08:36.360 --> 08:40.354
On the subway,
I could have told my secret,
nobody would have cared.

08:41.120 --> 08:42.793
But you came back here.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.673
Mary, I can't live
on the subway.

08:44.880 --> 08:45.880
Ah.

08:46.040 --> 08:48.350
So I figure
I can tell the secret here,

08:48.560 --> 08:52.759
except, of course,
I don't want to live here.
Mary, I got no place to go.

08:52.960 --> 08:55.236
So, darling, tell me
the secret and come home.

08:55.440 --> 08:58.239
I can't. I gotta go.
I don't know where
I'm going, but I gotta go.

08:58.440 --> 09:00.636
Burt. I love you.
What?

09:00.840 --> 09:04.356
You are the most important
thing in my life to me.

09:04.560 --> 09:06.870
So there is nothing,
absolutely nothing,

09:07.080 --> 09:10.835
that you could tell me
that would change the way I feel.

to be so difficult.

I'm your mother.

I am enormously attracted to him.

take my eyes off him.

How can you do that to her?

Because I hate her.

She's never done
anything to you.

12:14.640 --> 12:16.518

That wasn't her.
That was my grandmother.

to Ecuador, of all places,

coming from Sweden,
