00:03.671 --> 00:05.939
Can I tell 'em?
No, you tell 'em.

00:05.973 --> 00:06.974
Which basically means

00:07.007 --> 00:08.676
I'm telling 'em,
so I can tell 'em.

00:08.709 --> 00:09.777
Tell me to tell 'em!

00:09.810 --> 00:10.578
I'll tell them!

00:10.611 --> 00:11.712
You hired the wrong person

00:11.745 --> 00:13.181
to speak for JJ.

00:13.214 --> 00:14.882
Try bringing me down,
blondie!

00:14.915 --> 00:17.151
Not today, 'cause you
are looking at...

00:17.185 --> 00:18.152
Can I tell 'em?

00:18.186 --> 00:18.786
-Oh, come on.
-Yes! Yes!

00:18.819 --> 00:20.020
For the love of God!

00:20.054 --> 00:22.156
...an award-nominated
filmmaker!

00:22.190 --> 00:24.658
-That's amazing!

00:24.692 --> 00:26.026
Was it one of those
film festivals you applied to?

00:26.060 --> 00:26.860
Which one?

00:26.894 --> 00:27.828
Which ones.

00:27.861 --> 00:28.796
He's got two festivals

00:28.829 --> 00:30.564
on the same weekend!

00:30.598 --> 00:32.200
"I can't go to
your festival.

00:32.233 --> 00:34.168
I've got another festival
to go to."

00:34.202 --> 00:35.536
Burn!

00:35.569 --> 00:36.604
Don't look at me with that

00:36.637 --> 00:38.806
"It's an honor
to be nominated" mess.

00:38.839 --> 00:42.042
Be proud. Recognition for
a young, black filmmaker.

00:42.076 --> 00:43.677
-He's a success now.

00:43.711 --> 00:45.045
I'm claiming him.
Yes, he's black.

00:45.079 --> 00:48.015
So, Orange County Horror Fest --
that's next town over.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.684
Or...wow! Vancouver?!

00:50.718 --> 00:53.721
All expense paid for
two first-class accommodations.

00:53.754 --> 00:56.023
Well, this could take
milliseconds to decide.

00:56.056 --> 00:59.059
"I want to go on the trip.

00:59.093 --> 01:03.564
And I love you all,
but I'm t-taking the person

01:03.597 --> 01:08.102
who spends her life
fighting to make mine better."

01:08.136 --> 01:10.638
Darling, you're gonna
make me cry.

01:10.671 --> 01:12.906
"And I hope I win

01:12.940 --> 01:17.478
so I can tell the world
what you mean to me."

01:17.511 --> 01:19.980
You have to stop.
We don't do this.

01:20.013 --> 01:21.215
We're British.

01:21.249 --> 01:22.216
So, now he's British --

01:22.250 --> 01:23.384
If he can be black,

01:23.417 --> 01:25.153
he can be bloody British!

**

01:30.624 --> 01:33.927
I need this loan.
I have to buy my house.

01:33.961 --> 01:35.429
They're selling it
out from under me.

01:35.463 --> 01:38.666
Our three beautiful kids,
they love this place.

01:38.699 --> 01:41.935
They're always throwing stuff
on the ground with both hands,

01:41.969 --> 01:44.505
but they're mad.
They don't want to do it.

01:44.538 --> 01:46.640
They...
I don't...

01:46.674 --> 01:49.543
One of our children uses
a wheelchair!

01:49.577 --> 01:53.181
Will you please let us know
as soon as possible. Thank you.

01:53.214 --> 01:55.883
We lose the house on Friday.
We have to tell the kids.

01:55.916 --> 01:57.718
No. No way.

01:57.751 --> 01:59.320
I am not going to have them
worrying about this.

01:59.353 --> 02:00.888
The loan is gonna
come through.

02:00.921 --> 02:02.490
The kids can't know.

02:02.523 --> 02:03.724
You might want to tell
the neighbor's

02:03.757 --> 02:07.161
construction workers
in our yard.

02:07.195 --> 02:10.130
The house is still ours
until Friday!

02:10.164 --> 02:10.964
Get outta my yard,

02:10.998 --> 02:12.333
you Scandinavian animals.

02:12.366 --> 02:14.602
Ikea! Ikea!

02:14.635 --> 02:17.070
Git! I said, "Git!"

02:17.104 --> 02:19.240
What are you chasing away?

02:19.273 --> 02:21.809
Uh...

02:21.842 --> 02:23.611
Coyote.

02:23.644 --> 02:24.945
!
-Mnh.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.614
They eat dogs.

02:26.647 --> 02:29.883
Yes, but Daddy
took care of it.

02:29.917 --> 02:32.486
I said, "Git."
They hate that.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.255
Yeah, but what about
when it comes back?

02:34.288 --> 02:35.656
What about Pepper?

02:35.689 --> 02:36.590
Maya: Darling, you don't
have to be worried.

02:36.624 --> 02:39.193
There is not coyote.
Jimmy, tell her.

02:39.227 --> 02:42.930
Mom, it's so obvious
when you lie.

02:42.963 --> 02:45.999
Give it
to me straight, Dad.

02:46.033 --> 02:48.168
It will come back.

02:48.202 --> 02:49.470
And I'll take care of it,

02:49.503 --> 02:51.639
because I hunt
and track coyotes.

02:51.672 --> 02:54.074
See, Mom?
Is that so hard?

02:54.675 --> 02:56.744
Mnh.

02:56.777 --> 02:57.645
Wow.

02:57.678 --> 02:58.679
Thanks, Jimbo.

02:58.712 --> 03:01.649
Ah.

03:01.682 --> 03:02.850
That was for her.

03:02.883 --> 03:04.852
It was a lie that made me
a hero.

03:04.885 --> 03:05.719
Sue me.

03:05.753 --> 03:07.488
-Git.
-Okay.

03:13.361 --> 03:15.028
Oh, I must be dreaming.

03:15.062 --> 03:18.332
Kiss me, dream Taylor.
Come take what's yours.

03:18.366 --> 03:20.768
Ray! What are you doing?!

03:20.801 --> 03:23.271
Oh, Taylor.
You don't go to school here.

03:23.304 --> 03:25.606
Uh-oh. Do you have
early onset dementia?

03:25.639 --> 03:28.175
No, but my uncle does.
It's been very hard.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.510
So sorry.
Thoughts and prayers.

03:29.543 --> 03:30.678
Thoughts and prayers.

03:30.711 --> 03:32.513
My friend's boyfriend
plays basketball.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.315
They're playing you guys.
She took me to a game.

03:34.348 --> 03:36.216
I got super into it.

03:36.250 --> 03:37.685
Yeah, totally.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.953
Kobe Bryant,
the Spalding Company,

03:39.987 --> 03:42.390
two points per basket,
love it all.

03:42.423 --> 03:44.558
It's amazing what
those guys can do.

03:44.592 --> 03:46.294
Oh, those guys
impress you?

03:46.327 --> 03:47.295
It was nice seeing you.

03:47.328 --> 03:49.397
I've got to go. Bye.

03:49.430 --> 03:52.500
Kenneth.
Teach me basketball.

03:52.533 --> 03:53.834
Hello, bossy.

03:53.867 --> 03:54.402
Would you like
to try that again

03:54.435 --> 03:55.869
with a different tone?

03:55.903 --> 03:57.505
Kenneth, will you please
teach me basketball?

03:57.538 --> 03:59.307
No.
Oh, come on!

03:59.340 --> 04:01.342
Make me a jock so I can
impress Taylor.

04:01.375 --> 04:02.910
Ray, it's not gonna happen.

04:02.943 --> 04:05.546
You are the least athletic
person I know.

04:05.579 --> 04:07.915
That's
a bit of exaggeration.

04:10.584 --> 04:13.186
**

04:13.220 --> 04:15.022
Hi, yeah,
this is Jimmy DiMeo.

04:15.055 --> 04:17.858
I'm calling to say "Yes"
to the loan you offered me.

04:17.891 --> 04:18.992
No, I didn't think
that was gonna work.

04:19.026 --> 04:19.593
Yeah, I'll hold.

04:19.627 --> 04:21.529
The van is loaded. JJ!

04:21.562 --> 04:23.030
Let's get you to that festival.

04:23.063 --> 04:24.398
We're so proud of you,
buddy.

04:24.432 --> 04:26.867
JJ, I want you to win, and
not just because

04:26.900 --> 04:29.136
we're both James DiMeo
and it'll make it so

04:29.169 --> 04:31.705
our first Google result is no
longer that time that Leno

04:31.739 --> 04:33.040
interviewed me
for jaywalking

04:33.073 --> 04:36.744
and I couldn't name
a state president or fruit.

04:36.777 --> 04:41.549
"I already won.
They picked me for me.

04:41.582 --> 04:46.954
Making M-O -- movies
has finally given me

04:46.987 --> 04:52.926
a way for people to see me,
not the chair."

04:52.960 --> 04:55.396
That was so beautiful.

04:55.429 --> 04:56.930
If someone believed in me,

04:56.964 --> 04:59.800
I could be getting invitations
to basketball festivals.

04:59.833 --> 05:02.302
Not gonna happen, Ray.
Let's get you two on the road.

05:02.336 --> 05:03.437
Bye, JJ.

05:03.471 --> 05:04.872
Knock 'em dead, buddy.

05:04.905 --> 05:07.107
Swish it, JJ.
Swish it right in the paint.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.409
Dude, stop!

05:08.442 --> 05:09.810
Oh, hi. Hello, yes.

05:09.843 --> 05:12.245
Yeah, listen.
I just need to know

05:12.279 --> 05:13.947
if my loan's gonna be
approved by Friday.

05:13.981 --> 05:14.915
Woman: Please hold.

05:14.948 --> 05:15.949
No, don't put me
on hold again.

05:15.983 --> 05:18.251
Ugh! Damn it.

05:18.285 --> 05:19.587
What was that about?

05:19.620 --> 05:21.154
Oh, uh, dah, animal control.

05:21.188 --> 05:24.792
I keep calling about
my coyote application,

05:24.825 --> 05:26.460
and they keep putting me
on hold.

05:26.494 --> 05:27.995
I hate seeing you like this.

05:28.028 --> 05:29.162
Mnh.

05:29.196 --> 05:31.164
What are you doing?

05:31.198 --> 05:33.467
Your coyote application
just got approved.

05:33.501 --> 05:35.168
We're doing this together.

05:35.202 --> 05:36.437
Dylan, uh, no.

05:36.470 --> 05:38.572
What? Let me help you.

05:38.606 --> 05:41.074
I'm sure a lot of my Ray traps
would work on a coyote.

05:41.108 --> 05:43.176
Honey, this is not
your problem.

05:43.210 --> 05:44.144
Ray traps?

05:44.177 --> 05:47.515
I'm handling it -- alone.

05:47.548 --> 05:50.050
Oh. Okay.

05:50.083 --> 05:52.119
What the hero says goes.

05:52.152 --> 05:56.089
**

05:56.123 --> 05:57.425
Ray, look out!

05:58.659 --> 06:00.761
Whoa. Good move.

06:00.794 --> 06:04.197
You just stood there
and...took it.

06:04.231 --> 06:07.200
Hey, coach! You gotta see
what this kid can do.

06:07.234 --> 06:10.270
Hey, you. Play one-on-one
with this guy right here.

06:10.303 --> 06:12.806
Full disclosure,
I don't really dribble.

06:12.840 --> 06:14.141
I "drabble."

06:14.174 --> 06:15.809
Shh. Don't say that
to people.

06:15.843 --> 06:18.912
Listen, do exactly what you did
out in the hallway, okay?

06:18.946 --> 06:20.681
Trust me.

06:20.714 --> 06:21.515
Okay, kid.

06:25.486 --> 06:27.455
Offensive foul. Charging.

06:27.488 --> 06:29.790
And he'll do it like that
every time.

06:29.823 --> 06:31.024
Whatever it takes,
right, Ray?

06:31.058 --> 06:33.594
Oh, totally.
Ray on the floor?

06:33.627 --> 06:34.728
Please, sir,

06:34.762 --> 06:35.663
may I have some more?

06:35.696 --> 06:37.397
Welcome to the team.

06:37.431 --> 06:41.034
**

06:41.068 --> 06:44.071
Ooh, fantastic.

06:44.104 --> 06:48.108
Why is everyone
staring at me?

06:48.141 --> 06:50.410
"Because you're dressed like
you're at the Oscars."

06:50.444 --> 06:53.146
You should see
what I'm gonna wear to those.

06:53.180 --> 06:56.383
JJ DiMeo! Vince Stoeffer.
One of the festival chairs.

06:56.416 --> 06:59.386
Hey. Chair. Chair.
Two chairs.

07:01.254 --> 07:05.859
"How do you know me?
I just sent my movie."

07:05.893 --> 07:09.262
Right, and I have to admit,
I haven't seen the movie per se.

07:09.296 --> 07:13.066
But even without seeing it,
it moved me to tears.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.903
Filmmaker's reception?
That way.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.538
Oh, that's where
we're going then?

07:17.571 --> 07:18.906
No. You are going
to the reception

07:18.939 --> 07:21.909
for the Vanguard Award
nominees.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.443
**

07:23.477 --> 07:26.446
Oh.

07:26.480 --> 07:31.552
And w-what exactly
is the Vanguard Award?

07:38.025 --> 07:39.292
Hm.

07:39.326 --> 07:43.096
So, Vanguard is Canadian
for tokenism, eh?

07:46.900 --> 07:48.168
Maya: "I don't understand.

07:48.201 --> 07:51.539
How did they even know
I'm disabled?"

07:51.572 --> 07:54.642
Yeah, your movie didn't have
a damn thing about disability.

07:54.675 --> 07:57.678
Didn't have any well-rounded
female characters, either.

07:57.711 --> 08:00.247
I'm making a joke.
But it didn't.

08:00.280 --> 08:02.916
Oh, excuse me.
What exactly is this?

08:02.950 --> 08:04.918
I'm pretty sure
it's stupid.

08:04.952 --> 08:06.820
Apparently, last year,
they gave too many awards

08:06.854 --> 08:09.322
to able-bodied,
straight white guys.

08:09.356 --> 08:11.725
"Have they even seen
your movies?"

08:11.759 --> 08:13.927
I hope not. Mine stinks.

08:13.961 --> 08:14.928
What do you mean
"It stinks?"

08:14.962 --> 08:17.364
Stinks. Like, it's bad.

08:17.397 --> 08:19.833
Like, the sculpture I entered
in that art contest.

08:19.867 --> 08:21.134
Honey, what award
did I win for that?

08:21.168 --> 08:22.603
Was I a Pioneer?

08:22.636 --> 08:23.436
Trailblazer.

08:23.470 --> 08:24.972
Yeah, yeah. Trailblazer.

08:25.005 --> 08:27.307
I blazed a trail
right to Sucktown.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.243
"And you're okay
with that?"

08:30.277 --> 08:32.279
Okay? That lump
won me 500 bucks.

08:32.312 --> 08:33.614
What was it, honey?
It was a horse?

08:33.647 --> 08:36.183
Didn't look like any horse
I've ever seen.

08:36.216 --> 08:38.151
"They're using us.
We should leave!"

08:38.185 --> 08:40.688
You're right. Let's all go.
That'll show 'em.

08:40.721 --> 08:42.222
You're going to stay.

08:42.255 --> 08:44.157
And definitely win
a grand? Nah!

08:44.892 --> 08:46.894
"Well, I'm leaving.

08:46.927 --> 08:48.662
Anyone coming?"

08:48.696 --> 08:51.164
**

08:51.198 --> 08:53.433
"Okay, then. Good luck."

08:53.466 --> 08:55.468
Yeah, you tell 'em, kid.

08:55.502 --> 08:57.638
Hey, leave your
Welcome bag, too.

08:57.671 --> 08:58.538
That'll show 'em!

of "Git."

Oh, Dylan,
what have you done?

09:13.253 --> 09:14.722
I know you wanted to catch
the coyote yourself,

worried it was making you.

19:01.841 --> 19:05.445
Well, this normally
unforgivable oversight

19:05.478 --> 19:07.146
has come at just
the right moment.

19:07.180 --> 19:09.349
Thank you. Thank you.

19:09.382 --> 19:10.783
There's got to be a way
to get you in.

19:10.817 --> 19:11.884
Woman: Thank you all for...

19:11.918 --> 19:13.186
Oh, God. They're announcing
your category.

19:13.220 --> 19:15.488
Come on. Follow me.

19:15.522 --> 19:18.225
I mean, I did spend a long time
on that letter.

19:18.258 --> 19:22.595
* The warmth of your love's
like the warmth of the sun *

19:22.629 --> 19:24.297
* And this will be our year

19:24.331 --> 19:27.267
They certainly didn't know
you were in a wheelchair.

19:27.300 --> 19:30.737
Wait, you expect my son
to use a garbage ramp?!

19:30.770 --> 19:32.739
That's fantastic!

19:32.772 --> 19:34.106
Announcer:
Our next category

19:34.140 --> 19:36.108
is "Best Short Film."

19:36.142 --> 19:37.844
And the nominees are...

19:37.877 --> 19:39.479
It's too narrow.

19:39.512 --> 19:40.112
He's not gonna fit through.

19:40.146 --> 19:41.113
Pick him up!

19:41.147 --> 19:42.349
Like a couch?

19:42.382 --> 19:43.550
Stop complaining.
Grab the ends.

19:43.583 --> 19:44.517
Oh!

19:44.551 --> 19:45.285
* Darling, I love you"

19:45.318 --> 19:47.186
And the Kevvy goes to...

19:47.220 --> 19:49.389
"The Hall" by JJ DiMeo.

19:49.422 --> 19:50.590
Maya: He won!!

19:52.892 --> 19:56.028
Ack! Too bright!

19:56.062 --> 19:58.197
* The warmth of your smile

19:58.231 --> 19:59.399
* Smile for me, little one

19:59.432 --> 20:02.569
Hey! I-I-I got all the food
I could carry!

20:02.602 --> 20:04.136
Oh, no! We're not
doing that anymore.

20:04.170 --> 20:06.373
Help throw the boy
on the stage!

20:06.406 --> 20:07.740
* You don't have to worry

20:07.774 --> 20:09.976
* All your worried days
are gone *

20:10.009 --> 20:11.210
There's steps.

20:11.244 --> 20:13.313
We're committed to this now.

20:13.346 --> 20:14.547
* Took a long time to come

20:14.581 --> 20:15.548
-Nice dress.

20:15.582 --> 20:16.849
* And I won't forget

20:16.883 --> 20:20.653
* The way you held me up
when I was down *

20:20.687 --> 20:23.490
* And I won't forget
the way you said *

20:23.523 --> 20:26.025
* "Darling, I love you,"
you gave me faith to go on *

20:30.497 --> 20:32.799
Yeah, that's not gonna happen!

20:42.542 --> 20:44.010
I can't believe our son is
an award-winning director.

20:44.043 --> 20:45.312
It all worked out.

20:45.345 --> 20:47.079
Right, kids?

20:47.113 --> 20:49.482
I mean, it's okay.

20:49.516 --> 20:51.017
This isn't the plan,
though, right?

20:51.050 --> 20:52.218
[ Train whistle blowing
in distance ]

20:52.251 --> 20:53.720
The stars are nice.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.888
Kenneth: Ooh!
A shooting star!

20:55.922 --> 20:57.557
No. Plane.

20:57.590 --> 20:58.858
Kenneth, what the bloody hell
are you doing here?

20:58.891 --> 21:01.561
Sorry, I...let myself in.

21:01.594 --> 21:04.063
Hey, what's the plan
for tomorrow?

21:04.096 --> 21:07.099
We'll figure it out.
I mean, we always do.

21:07.133 --> 21:08.668
You good, JJ?

21:08.701 --> 21:10.603
**

21:10.637 --> 21:13.172
Oh, yeah. He's good.

21:13.205 --> 21:17.043
**

21:17.076 --> 21:21.180
**

21:21.213 --> 21:25.385
