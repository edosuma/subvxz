WEBVTT

00:22.500 --> 00:24.041
- Get her in the back.
- What.. What do I--

00:24.125 --> 00:26.041
Follow directions.

00:47.667 --> 00:48.667
Okay, let me get out first.

01:22.542 --> 01:24.208
(John)
'The guys were digging
up the foundation'

01:24.291 --> 01:25.500
of the old Calvin building.

01:25.583 --> 01:27.500
They made the discovery
this morning.

01:27.583 --> 01:29.000
Two bags of bones.

01:29.083 --> 01:31.417
- In the cement?
- No, underneath.

01:31.500 --> 01:33.333
(Scotty)
'So they got thrown in here
when they were first'

01:33.417 --> 01:34.625
'putting up the building?'

01:34.709 --> 01:37.000
Yeah, the doer figured
they were buried forever

01:37.083 --> 01:39.667
and now the city
wants a parking lot.

01:39.750 --> 01:41.417
The remains
are mostly skeletal

01:41.500 --> 01:44.250
'but they were buried
in plastic, so, uh..'

01:44.333 --> 01:46.250
'a lot of the
clothes survived.'

01:47.750 --> 01:50.208
One male.
One female.

01:51.208 --> 01:52.834
How can you tell that?

01:52.917 --> 01:55.625
Pelvic bones. Shoe size.

01:57.458 --> 01:59.875
Since when did bell bottoms
come back in style

01:59.959 --> 02:01.333
five years ago?

02:01.417 --> 02:02.792
Don't look at me.

02:02.875 --> 02:05.375
They've been down here
more than five years.

02:05.458 --> 02:08.208
(Will)
Oh, this building's
at least 30 years old.

02:08.291 --> 02:10.959
So they're from the original
days of bell bottoms.

02:11.041 --> 02:12.667
The '60s.

02:12.750 --> 02:16.125
Those pants were ugly
the first time around.

02:18.959 --> 02:20.375
Look at that.

02:25.417 --> 02:26.959
Summer of love.

02:27.875 --> 02:30.083
Where did it all go wrong?

03:03.750 --> 03:06.250
1969. You weren't even
born yet, right?

03:06.333 --> 03:09.458
No. World had to wait
till
the '70s for me.

03:09.542 --> 03:11.583
Tell me, how many words
there are for narcissist?

03:11.667 --> 03:13.417
(Elisa)
'Scotty.'

03:13.500 --> 03:15.000
Hey. You okay?

03:15.083 --> 03:18.792
Yeah. You just forgot to
fill
this out before you
left.

03:20.625 --> 03:21.875
I'll see you upstairs.

03:21.959 --> 03:24.792
Hi, uh, I'm Elisa.

03:25.542 --> 03:27.959
- Lilly.
- Hi.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.959
My partner.

03:30.041 --> 03:32.458
Wha.. You're a detective?

03:32.542 --> 03:33.875
Yeah.

03:33.959 --> 03:35.917
You're so beautiful.

03:37.458 --> 03:38.709
Thanks.

03:40.667 --> 03:42.750
- See you up there.
- Yeah.

03:45.208 --> 03:46.750
Sorry.

03:47.625 --> 03:48.875
Did I embarrass you?

03:48.959 --> 03:50.959
No.

03:51.041 --> 03:53.542
You never told me
your
partner was a girl.

03:53.625 --> 03:55.542
Yeah.

03:55.625 --> 03:57.959
You okay today?

03:58.041 --> 03:59.625
Yeah.

03:59.709 --> 04:01.792
It's a good day, I think.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.500
Quiet.

04:11.917 --> 04:13.166
No box on these two jobs.

04:13.250 --> 04:14.792
Had to go to missing persons.

04:14.875 --> 04:16.208
A White woman and Black man

04:16.291 --> 04:18.834
disappeared
together
June 3, 1969.

04:18.917 --> 04:20.542
Missing persons didn't
knock themselves out.

04:20.625 --> 04:22.625
Yeah, if you're over
18
and of sound mind

04:22.709 --> 04:23.917
you're allowed to disappear.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.166
And the lifestyle.

04:25.250 --> 04:26.834
A lot of people
disappeared in the '60s.

04:26.917 --> 04:28.333
Some of 'em don't even know it.

04:28.417 --> 04:31.750
The woman was Julia Hoffman,
22, reported missing

04:31.834 --> 04:34.083
'by her parents,
now deceased.'

04:34.166 --> 04:35.583
Lived in a commune.

04:35.667 --> 04:39.000
Disappeared with
Gerard Gary, 23.

04:39.083 --> 04:41.291
Looks like Julia's station
wagon disappeared, too.

04:41.375 --> 04:43.000
We ran a NCIC search,
see if the car

04:43.083 --> 04:44.750
ever turned up
anywhere, but no
luck.

04:44.834 --> 04:46.834
These bodies were dumped
professional-style

04:46.917 --> 04:48.125
in that construction site.

04:48.208 --> 04:49.667
Which says organized crime.

04:49.750 --> 04:52.000
(Nick)
'So how does that
intersect with hippies?'

04:52.083 --> 04:54.417
- 'Drugs?'
- Had to buy 'em somewhere.

04:54.500 --> 04:56.417
Maybe the Black-White thing
bothered somebody.

04:56.500 --> 04:58.000
You got any family contacts
on either of them?

04:58.083 --> 05:00.417
No, but we have a name
on a boyfriend for
Julia.

05:00.500 --> 05:02.041
Another commune member.

05:02.125 --> 05:03.834
You mean the guy she was found
with wasn't her boyfriend?

05:03.917 --> 05:05.542
Even if he was, she had one
at home, too.

05:05.625 --> 05:08.000
Not a bad motive
for boyfriend number one

05:08.083 --> 05:09.375
there being a number two.

05:09.458 --> 05:11.709
Let's go see
this
commune guy.

05:12.917 --> 05:16.291
Adam Clarke, where are you now?

05:20.125 --> 05:21.709
Life coach.

05:23.083 --> 05:25.667
(Adam)
'You get to choose'

05:25.750 --> 05:28.792
how to view
your experience.

05:28.875 --> 05:30.917
What's the empowering choice?

05:31.000 --> 05:32.458
Taking responsibility.

05:32.542 --> 05:36.417
Winners take
responsibility, alright?

05:37.417 --> 05:39.083
Alright.
See everyone tomorrow.

05:39.166 --> 05:40.834
Thanks.

05:40.917 --> 05:43.250
- Adam Clarke?
- Yeah.

05:43.333 --> 05:46.542
Detectives Rush and
Valens.
Homicide.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.750
That's a room-emptier.

05:49.834 --> 05:51.625
We're here
about Julia Hoffman.

05:52.667 --> 05:55.709
You were dating
her in 1969?

05:55.792 --> 05:57.250
Yeah.

05:57.333 --> 05:59.625
Till she
disappeared on me.

06:01.333 --> 06:03.083
Her remains
have been found.

06:03.166 --> 06:06.500
Along with the remains
of Gerard Gary.

06:12.875 --> 06:14.834
You mind?

06:14.917 --> 06:17.000
They're herbal.

06:18.709 --> 06:22.291
I thought Julia went to
Canada
with that Gerard guy.

06:22.375 --> 06:24.959
Looks like they never
made it out of the city.

06:25.041 --> 06:26.208
Ugly.

06:26.291 --> 06:28.291
What kind of relationship
did you two have?

06:28.375 --> 06:31.959
Six months of hot and
heavy
in the commune.

06:32.041 --> 06:33.542
(Lilly)
'Serious?'

06:33.625 --> 06:37.333
No. I was more serious
about ending the war.

06:37.417 --> 06:38.875
So her being with
this other guy

06:38.959 --> 06:40.500
didn't rile you at all.

06:40.583 --> 06:43.250
We had an open relationship.

06:43.333 --> 06:44.458
It was the '60s.

06:44.542 --> 06:46.041
It was part of the revolution

06:46.125 --> 06:48.709
change the world,
change ourselves.

06:48.792 --> 06:51.041
(Lilly)
But human nature
doesn't always conform

06:51.125 --> 06:53.083
to revolutionary ideals.

06:53.166 --> 06:54.792
Well, that's why I do this work.

06:54.875 --> 06:57.709
And that's being
a life coach, I take it.

06:57.792 --> 07:00.125
It's easy to make fun of.

07:00.208 --> 07:01.583
We have a saying

07:01.667 --> 07:03.917
Being cynical is
the booby prize.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.917
Any idea if Julia and
Gerard were dealing
drugs?

07:07.000 --> 07:08.709
- 'No chance.'
- Aw, come on, Adam.

07:08.792 --> 07:10.041
Summer of '69.

07:10.125 --> 07:12.750
Oh, we took drugs,
for sure,
but...dealing?

07:12.834 --> 07:14.792
We just weren't
that organized.

07:14.875 --> 07:16.041
The last time you saw Julia

07:16.125 --> 07:18.667
did you fight,
and part on bad terms?

07:20.208 --> 07:22.291
Furthest thing from it.

07:37.792 --> 07:39.208
It's time.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.542
Our soldiers are coming
home in body bags!

07:53.625 --> 07:55.875
The Vietnamese people
die and die!

07:57.375 --> 07:58.667
'Now, there comes a time'

07:58.750 --> 08:01.208
when you have to throw
yourself into history.

08:01.291 --> 08:04.000
Not stand on the sidelines.

08:06.667 --> 08:08.834
My draft card!

08:12.375 --> 08:14.291
You let 'em arrest me!

08:15.417 --> 08:17.875
I'm saying no!

08:19.125 --> 08:21.750
I'm saying hell, no!

08:23.083 --> 08:25.417
I won't go!

08:29.500 --> 08:31.792
Hell, no, we won't go!

08:31.875 --> 08:34.333
(in unison)
Hell, no, we won't go!

08:34.417 --> 08:36.500
Hell, no, we won't go!

08:36.583 --> 08:38.709
Hell, no,
we won't go!

08:38.792 --> 08:40.417
Hell, no, we won't go!

08:40.500 --> 08:42.417
Hell, no,
we won't go!

08:42.500 --> 08:44.000
Hell, no, we won't..

08:45.375 --> 08:46.750
Glory days, huh?

08:46.834 --> 08:48.625
Intense..

08:48.709 --> 08:50.208
...as we used to say.

08:50.291 --> 08:52.041
And Julia and
Gerard
being together

08:52.125 --> 08:57.250
that didn't bring up any
intense
feelings, like jealousy?

08:57.333 --> 08:59.625
It hurt, some.

08:59.709 --> 09:01.500
But that was our deal.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.333
Who was the
girl
with Julia?

09:04.417 --> 09:06.000
Her friend Terri.

09:06.083 --> 09:07.959
She lived with us
for a while.

09:08.041 --> 09:09.291
Remember her last name?

09:09.375 --> 09:10.625
'Maxwell.'

09:10.709 --> 09:12.083
A rich Cherry Hill girl

09:12.166 --> 09:14.208
who came and played hippie
for a couple years.

09:14.291 --> 09:17.041
Now she's a rich art dealer.

09:22.417 --> 09:26.375
Julia and I were on
dishes
duty at the commune.

09:26.458 --> 09:28.333
The men were
totally
into equality

09:28.417 --> 09:31.250
until we ran out
of clean plates.

09:33.208 --> 09:35.000
(Lilly)
So you knew Adam Clarke?

09:35.083 --> 09:37.750
Of course! He was the king
of the commune.

09:37.834 --> 09:41.458
Well, he claims he didn't
mind
Julia being with Gerard.

09:41.542 --> 09:43.125
You believe that?

09:43.208 --> 09:45.166
I do, actually.

09:45.250 --> 09:48.500
If only because he
was
so...self-absorbed.

09:48.583 --> 09:50.000
Hmm. How so?

09:50.083 --> 09:52.834
Well, he was the star
of the anti-war movement.

09:52.917 --> 09:55.458
And he was inspiring, I admit.

09:56.250 --> 09:57.667
But he was an ass.

09:57.750 --> 10:01.166
He thought of himself as
a babe magnet,
'60s-style.

10:01.250 --> 10:03.875
Well, even babe magnets
don't like being dumped.

10:03.959 --> 10:05.792
Especially babe magnets.

10:05.875 --> 10:09.667
I just don't think he cared
enough about Julia to harm
her.

10:09.750 --> 10:10.959
Right.

10:12.792 --> 10:16.208
There is something I
didn't
tell the police in '69.

10:16.291 --> 10:18.000
In my world, back then..

10:19.417 --> 10:21.750
...you just didn't tell
the cops a lot of things.

10:21.834 --> 10:23.625
Oink, oink?

10:23.709 --> 10:25.834
Yeah.

10:25.917 --> 10:28.208
What didn't you tell?

10:28.291 --> 10:34.250
Julia and Gerard were
into
something...clandestine.

10:34.333 --> 10:35.542
Like what?

10:35.625 --> 10:38.542
There were a lot of
secret phone calls.

10:38.625 --> 10:43.500
Um, messages from someone
who called himself Dr. L.

10:43.583 --> 10:47.375
And Julia always had
these envelopes of cash.

10:47.458 --> 10:49.709
And how do you know
Gerard was involved?

10:49.792 --> 10:52.208
The night before
they disappeared

10:52.291 --> 10:54.500
they were planning something.

10:54.583 --> 10:56.125
(in unison)
Hell, no, we won't go!

10:56.208 --> 10:58.083
Hell, no, we won't go!

10:58.166 --> 11:00.125
The meeting place
doesn't work
anymore.

11:00.208 --> 11:01.417
I know.

11:01.500 --> 11:05.208
7:00 a.m. tomorrow,
we pick up on a new corner.

11:06.291 --> 11:07.875
She'll have the bread?

11:08.000 --> 11:10.083
Yep.

11:10.166 --> 11:11.542
You scared?

11:13.333 --> 11:15.750
No way, baby. You?

11:19.417 --> 11:21.458
Hell, no, we won't go!

11:21.542 --> 11:23.166
Does he know?

11:25.333 --> 11:27.792
I'd never tell him.

11:37.083 --> 11:38.792
(in unison)
Hell, no, we won't go!

11:38.875 --> 11:41.625
Hell, no, we won't go!
Hell, no..

11:42.500 --> 11:43.834
Julia was your best friend

11:43.917 --> 11:45.250
and you didn't ask
her what was up?

11:45.333 --> 11:47.417
She didn't
want
to tell me.

11:47.500 --> 11:48.792
And to be honest

11:48.875 --> 11:51.667
I was scared to know.

11:51.750 --> 11:53.166
I was a suburbs girl

11:53.250 --> 11:54.875
trying out the commune life.

11:54.959 --> 11:57.166
If it ever got too
gritty, I knew

11:57.250 --> 11:59.291
I could always go home.

11:59.375 --> 12:02.375
But Julia, she was for real

12:03.458 --> 12:06.041
'and she was into something.'

12:07.041 --> 12:08.959
Deep.

12:09.041 --> 12:11.291
Forensics found a long
brown hair with the bodies

12:11.375 --> 12:12.834
under a piece of tape
on the plastic.

12:12.917 --> 12:14.417
Could be Julia's.

12:14.500 --> 12:15.959
We'll catch a break if it's not.

12:16.041 --> 12:18.291
- Any leads on the missing
car?
- 'Mm.'

12:18.375 --> 12:20.291
- Sludge.
- 'What about it?'

12:20.375 --> 12:22.291
Uh, it was smeared on the
plastic and the clothes

12:22.375 --> 12:25.125
'and has caffeic acid
and pyrazine in it.'

12:25.208 --> 12:27.458
Chemicals made
in manufacturing coffee.

12:27.542 --> 12:28.959
Killer gave 'em
one last cappuccino?

12:29.041 --> 12:30.917
(Nick)
'Or they were wrapped up
near the waterfront'

12:31.041 --> 12:32.500
by the Bogota coffee plant.

12:32.583 --> 12:33.959
Was it there in '69?

12:34.041 --> 12:36.667
- Established '66.
- Smart, Nicky.

12:36.750 --> 12:39.250
Gives a specific place
to dredge for a station wagon.

12:39.333 --> 12:40.667
That enough to get
the divers out?

12:40.750 --> 12:43.166
I'll call the marine unit.

12:50.792 --> 12:52.667
(John)
'I was at Woodstock, you
know.'

12:52.750 --> 12:53.792
You?

12:53.875 --> 12:56.709
Jimi Hendrix.
That cat could play.

12:56.792 --> 12:58.041
Did he say cat?

12:58.125 --> 13:00.834
You take your clothes off
and roll in the mud, boss?

13:00.917 --> 13:02.375
Uh, set-up and security

13:02.458 --> 13:04.250
for one of the vendors.

13:04.333 --> 13:05.792
Which one?

13:05.875 --> 13:07.125
Porta Potty.

13:07.208 --> 13:09.125
Now

13:10.667 --> 13:12.583
Let's take a look.

13:18.709 --> 13:21.417
(John)
'There's a real
time capsule for you.'

13:21.500 --> 13:24.166
(Scotty)
'35 years as a fish motel.'

13:27.500 --> 13:31.000
(John)
'What've you got there,
Lil, a dead fish?'

13:31.083 --> 13:33.208
Or a wallet.

13:33.291 --> 13:35.417
I should be doing
this in the lab.

13:35.500 --> 13:37.375
I won't tell on you, Louie.

13:37.458 --> 13:39.000
Want an orange crush?

13:39.083 --> 13:40.709
Yeah.

13:43.542 --> 13:49.083
So, Elisa you actually
introduce people to.

13:49.166 --> 13:51.542
- Sets her apart.
- Yeah.

13:51.625 --> 13:54.834
I'm sorry about
that, uh,
comment.

13:54.917 --> 13:56.667
Well, I don't mind
getting called beautiful.

13:56.750 --> 13:59.375
Well, she's not a
hundred percent
healthy.

14:01.041 --> 14:03.917
Doctor calls it
a-a thinking
disorder.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.875
Sometimes she..

14:07.959 --> 14:09.792
I think he's ready.

14:13.166 --> 14:16.458
This pouch was
inside the wallet.

14:16.542 --> 14:18.291
And it seems
to be airtight.

14:18.375 --> 14:20.834
- 'Like a zip lock?'
- 'Right.'

14:20.917 --> 14:23.083
So it protected
whatever's inside.

14:23.166 --> 14:25.709
Maybe.

14:25.792 --> 14:27.583
What is it?

14:29.709 --> 14:30.917
(Louie)
It's an address.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.417
"4912 Spruce Street. Jane."

14:34.500 --> 14:35.709
(John)
'West Philly.'

14:35.792 --> 14:39.041
"Do not give out address
except in emergency."

14:39.125 --> 14:42.166
I'd call a double
murder an emergency.

14:58.834 --> 15:00.500
Detectives
Rush and Valens.

15:00.583 --> 15:02.667
We're looking for Jane.

15:02.750 --> 15:04.291
You're here about Jane?

15:04.375 --> 15:06.208
Yeah. Is she here?

15:06.291 --> 15:08.542
Well, Jane's not a person.

15:08.625 --> 15:10.750
Jane's an organization.

15:12.625 --> 15:14.375
I'm Dr. Linden.

15:15.667 --> 15:16.917
"Dr. L."

15:17.000 --> 15:19.417
Yeah, please come in.

15:22.750 --> 15:25.166
Now, they were volunteers.

15:25.250 --> 15:28.000
Then they stopped, suddenly.

15:28.083 --> 15:30.333
What were they
volunteers for?

15:30.417 --> 15:32.333
Jane.

15:32.417 --> 15:34.083
An abortion service.

15:35.750 --> 15:37.250
Underground.

15:37.333 --> 15:40.625
In the '60s, abortion
was illegal.

15:40.709 --> 15:42.208
Women still had them of course.

15:42.291 --> 15:43.417
Yeah.

15:43.500 --> 15:44.583
Coat hangers.

15:44.667 --> 15:47.750
Knitting needles.
Ballpoint pens.

15:47.834 --> 15:50.125
Jane's purpose was
to keep people away from

15:50.208 --> 15:52.500
those dangerous procedures,
and provide them

15:52.583 --> 15:54.333
with safe ones.

15:54.417 --> 15:56.583
And you were a provider?

15:56.667 --> 15:58.542
Yeah.

15:58.625 --> 16:01.000
Until '73, when the law changed.

16:01.083 --> 16:03.625
What's with the name Jane?

16:03.709 --> 16:05.208
'Security.'

16:05.291 --> 16:07.500
Everything had
to be anonymous.

16:07.583 --> 16:08.875
How'd that work?

16:08.959 --> 16:10.583
Well, women would
call a number

16:10.667 --> 16:11.875
'and ask for Jane.'

16:11.959 --> 16:13.792
'The volunteers
would call back'

16:13.875 --> 16:15.208
'set up an appointment.'

16:15.291 --> 16:17.417
That what Julia and Gerard did?

16:17.500 --> 16:18.709
They escorted the patients

16:18.792 --> 16:21.875
handled the money,
they did everything.

16:21.959 --> 16:24.542
When did you last see them?

16:24.625 --> 16:27.583
In the morning, the
day they
disappeared.

16:29.291 --> 16:32.041
They brought over
a young girl..

16:36.417 --> 16:39.166
I'm sorry about the blindfold.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.667
I wouldn't tell anything.

16:42.750 --> 16:44.834
Especially if you
don't
know where we are.

16:44.917 --> 16:47.208
It's not dangerous.

16:52.291 --> 16:54.083
You gonna be okay.

16:54.166 --> 16:56.333
What do I have to do?

16:56.417 --> 16:59.250
The doctor will
talk
you through it.

16:59.333 --> 17:00.583
He's a real doctor?

17:00.667 --> 17:02.667
You'll get a D&C.

17:02.750 --> 17:04.625
I don't know what that is.

17:04.709 --> 17:06.792
Dilation and curettage.

17:06.875 --> 17:10.458
It's the safest
way.
Dr. L's real
good.

17:10.542 --> 17:12.834
He helped me.

17:12.917 --> 17:14.959
(Gerard)
'Doctor, this is Renee.'

17:16.000 --> 17:18.125
How do you do?

17:18.208 --> 17:19.417
Come with me now.

17:19.500 --> 17:21.291
We'll get through this together.

17:30.417 --> 17:32.959
The procedure went fine.

17:33.041 --> 17:35.625
Julia and
Gerard
left with her.

17:35.709 --> 17:37.083
And that's all I know.

17:37.166 --> 17:38.834
You never got
the girl's last name?

17:38.917 --> 17:42.291
No. I had to protect
my medical license.

17:42.375 --> 17:43.500
But Jane must've
had
her information

17:43.583 --> 17:45.041
in case
something
went wrong.

17:45.125 --> 17:48.166
Probably. But I only knew
the contact people.

17:48.250 --> 17:51.500
Did you get a new contact
after Julia and Gerard?

17:51.583 --> 17:53.291
Colette Ferguson.

17:53.375 --> 17:55.792
She's a poli-sci
professor at temple.

17:58.583 --> 18:02.750
I had an emergency number
and first name for that girl.

18:02.834 --> 18:04.166
Renee.

18:05.250 --> 18:06.667
No last name?

18:08.667 --> 18:10.166
When Julia and Gerard
went missing

18:10.250 --> 18:12.667
I called her,
like it was routine.

18:12.750 --> 18:14.250
She said everything was fine.

18:14.333 --> 18:15.917
You save that number?

18:16.000 --> 18:17.792
I did.

18:17.875 --> 18:19.917
I don't know why.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.333
My last link to Julia, probably.

18:23.417 --> 18:25.166
I'd have to find it.

18:25.250 --> 18:26.959
You were close to Julia?

18:29.750 --> 18:32.709
We met under the worst
of circumstances.

18:45.041 --> 18:46.583
(Julia)
'You okay?'

18:48.375 --> 18:50.208
He says I am.

18:53.333 --> 18:56.000
Does he do it here?

18:56.083 --> 18:57.500
The kitchen.

19:00.667 --> 19:02.291
What's he use?

19:04.166 --> 19:06.000
A bicycle spoke.

19:07.625 --> 19:10.125
He says to keep it in

19:10.208 --> 19:13.875
twenty...four hours.

19:13.959 --> 19:15.834
'Then it happens.'

19:17.625 --> 19:19.375
He's supposed to be good.

19:22.083 --> 19:23.458
you got the $400?

19:24.792 --> 19:26.709
I..

19:26.792 --> 19:29.542
...I-I have $350.

19:29.625 --> 19:32.709
Okay, it's four.

19:32.792 --> 19:34.834
I couldn't get more.

19:44.500 --> 19:47.625
I'll get you some
wine.
Calm you down.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.166
He made me touch him before.

20:06.667 --> 20:07.959
W-we should leave.

20:18.125 --> 20:22.542
She took me home, checked
in on me the next day.

20:22.625 --> 20:25.959
Which was lucky for me,
because I had an infection.

20:26.041 --> 20:29.792
By the time she got me
to the hospital..

20:29.875 --> 20:31.125
Bad, huh?

20:32.750 --> 20:35.041
Couldn't have children
because of it.

20:36.417 --> 20:39.917
So...how did Julia
get to Dr. Linden?

20:41.208 --> 20:42.709
'She found an
ad for Jane'

20:42.792 --> 20:44.792
in the "Free Weekly."

20:44.875 --> 20:48.000
She was so grateful after,
she went to work for Jane.

20:48.083 --> 20:49.250
I did, too.

20:49.333 --> 20:50.458
(Scotty)
'And she brought Gerard in?'

20:50.542 --> 20:52.166
No, he was already
a volunteer.

20:52.250 --> 20:53.834
- 'That's how they met.'
- Why was he doing it?

20:53.917 --> 20:55.834
He know someone who had one?

20:55.917 --> 20:58.375
Most everyone does, son.

21:01.417 --> 21:03.834
Sounds risky.

21:03.917 --> 21:05.875
Especially for Gerard.

21:06.792 --> 21:08.667
(Lilly)
'Why's that?'

21:08.750 --> 21:11.417
He was in the
Black Liberation Front.

21:11.500 --> 21:15.208
They were very militant,
and dead set against abortion.

21:15.291 --> 21:18.041
'Considered it genocide
for Black people.'

21:18.125 --> 21:20.208
Dead set as in murder?

21:20.291 --> 21:21.709
His working for Jane was like

21:21.792 --> 21:24.875
a declaration of war
to some people.

21:24.959 --> 21:28.667
Know anyone we can talk
to from the BLF?

21:28.750 --> 21:31.834
Lionel Royce was the leader
of the local chapter.

21:31.917 --> 21:34.083
Where's Lionel now?

21:34.166 --> 21:36.875
I hear he's
in and out of prison.

21:36.959 --> 21:41.417
Where he belongs, if he's
the one hurt those two.

21:41.500 --> 21:45.291
(Will)
We want to talk to you about
your old friend Gerard Gary.

21:45.375 --> 21:47.041
Tragic man.

21:47.125 --> 21:49.542
Limitless
potential,
unwise choices.

21:49.625 --> 21:52.250
You didn't like some
of his activities.

21:52.333 --> 21:55.041
Helping Black
girls
commit genocide?

21:55.125 --> 21:57.375
'No, I didn't like it.'

21:57.458 --> 21:59.208
But I'm a peaceful man.

21:59.291 --> 22:01.250
So what's the rifle about?

22:02.625 --> 22:04.542
Remember George W. Bush
in that flight suit

22:04.625 --> 22:06.792
landing on the aircraft carrier?

22:06.875 --> 22:08.542
All about the image.

22:08.625 --> 22:13.458
This...armed robbery beef
you're in for, that just
image?

22:13.542 --> 22:16.000
I was collecting
reparations for slavery.

22:16.083 --> 22:17.667
From a 7-Eleven?

22:17.750 --> 22:21.125
Look, I had issues with Gerard.

22:21.208 --> 22:23.458
However..

22:23.542 --> 22:26.667
...if you're suggesting
I'd kill a brother?

22:26.750 --> 22:30.875
We were way too busy
getting
spied on, lied to, informed
on

22:30.959 --> 22:32.834
and framed-up by
the US Government

22:32.917 --> 22:34.625
to turn on each other.

22:34.709 --> 22:37.083
You think you had an
informant in the BLF?

22:37.166 --> 22:38.834
I know there were informants.

22:38.917 --> 22:41.834
And maybe Gerard was one?

22:41.917 --> 22:43.667
It's possible.

22:44.917 --> 22:46.583
Way I see it, the White man's

22:46.667 --> 22:48.750
got your mind, and
the White woman's

22:48.834 --> 22:50.959
got your Johnson.

22:51.041 --> 22:52.250
- She's a friend.
- No.

22:52.333 --> 22:55.208
Our friends don't
come in that color.

22:56.500 --> 22:59.542
What, you tellin' me
who I can see?

22:59.625 --> 23:02.291
We gotta be role
models,
brother Gerard.

23:02.375 --> 23:04.083
Can't be running
around
with no blue eye

23:04.166 --> 23:05.542
blond hair Barbie doll.

23:05.625 --> 23:07.500
Man, you gonna
turn White
yourself.

23:07.583 --> 23:11.125
In case you haven't noticed,
the Black don't rub off.

23:11.208 --> 23:13.583
This is serious, brother.

23:13.667 --> 23:16.125
You know our secrets, man.

23:16.208 --> 23:17.959
You pillow talk
with that girl?

23:18.041 --> 23:19.125
'Huh?'

23:19.208 --> 23:21.375
'You can't trust
no White girl.'

23:21.458 --> 23:22.792
This ain't real to them.

23:22.875 --> 23:24.083
They just playing a game.

23:24.166 --> 23:26.583
This will never
be real to them.

23:31.208 --> 23:34.333
We gonna have to dry clean
this place of yours, Gerard.

23:37.417 --> 23:39.542
You think I'd betray you?

23:39.625 --> 23:42.500
Standard operating procedure.

23:54.041 --> 23:55.959
(Nick)
'So the Black Liberation
Front'

23:56.041 --> 23:58.667
thought Gerard
was talking to the FBI.

23:58.750 --> 24:04.125
Even if he was, we'd never
use a bullet on a Black man.

24:04.208 --> 24:06.333
How'd you know it was a bullet?

24:07.750 --> 24:10.417
Just a metaphor, brother man.

24:19.625 --> 24:21.208
Thanks for meeting me here.

24:21.291 --> 24:23.333
My kids are home, you know.

24:23.417 --> 24:25.208
Sure.

24:25.291 --> 24:27.291
These people were good to me.

24:27.375 --> 24:29.709
I feel like
they
saved my
life.

24:29.792 --> 24:32.000
You were 17?

24:32.083 --> 24:34.667
I didn't come from money,
and I wasn't smart.

24:35.917 --> 24:37.583
I wasn't gonna go to
college or anything

24:37.667 --> 24:39.542
but I wanted to get out.

24:39.625 --> 24:41.041
Yeah.

24:41.125 --> 24:44.083
Have a life that was
bigger
than two square miles.

24:44.166 --> 24:46.875
If I had a baby
in high school..

24:49.041 --> 24:51.125
Who knew about you
being pregnant?

24:52.250 --> 24:54.208
No one, for weeks.

24:54.291 --> 24:57.083
And then I told my boyfriend.

24:57.166 --> 24:59.291
He feel the same as you?

25:06.500 --> 25:07.709
Wow.

25:08.250 --> 25:09.542
Yeah.

25:11.709 --> 25:13.291
So we'll get married.

25:15.792 --> 25:18.625
Charlie, I was thinking
an abortion.

25:20.500 --> 25:22.166
That's illegal.

25:23.500 --> 25:25.834
How do you even..

25:25.917 --> 25:28.750
I'm trying to find out.

25:28.834 --> 25:30.542
Renee.

25:30.625 --> 25:32.667
I applied to Pan Am.

25:32.750 --> 25:34.917
Stewardess training.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.166
I did real good
on the test.

25:38.083 --> 25:40.917
Tell them something's come up.

25:41.000 --> 25:44.125
Charlie, I want to go places.

25:44.208 --> 25:46.750
London and stuff,
you know?

25:49.000 --> 25:51.625
We can go places together.

25:52.542 --> 25:54.500
No, we can't.

25:56.208 --> 25:57.917
If we have a baby

25:58.000 --> 26:00.625
we'll never even leave Fishtown.

26:04.792 --> 26:07.333
You talk like
your mind's made up.

26:12.500 --> 26:14.375
I need money.

26:18.250 --> 26:20.709
Screw you, Renee.

26:25.625 --> 26:28.208
(Lilly)
'So you were on your own.'

26:29.667 --> 26:32.166
I asked around and finally
found a girl at school

26:32.250 --> 26:35.834
whose cousin had
a number for Jane.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.458
How'd you pay for it?

26:41.542 --> 26:44.333
Sold a coat
and my record player.

26:44.417 --> 26:46.208
And Charlie?

26:49.291 --> 26:53.083
I thought it was best
if we didn't have any
contact.

26:56.041 --> 26:57.792
But?

27:00.417 --> 27:02.333
Renee.

27:02.417 --> 27:05.709
You said those people
saved your life.

27:07.792 --> 27:10.000
I thought I saw his truck.

27:11.583 --> 27:13.083
That day?

27:14.250 --> 27:16.834
Right before they picked me up.

27:19.917 --> 27:24.792
I had no idea anything
happened to those people.

27:32.125 --> 27:34.625
I wasn't upset about it.

27:34.709 --> 27:36.041
That's not what Renee said.

27:36.125 --> 27:38.083
She said you wanted
to get married.

27:38.166 --> 27:39.250
That's what you were
supposed to say

27:39.333 --> 27:41.041
if you got a girl in trouble.

27:41.125 --> 27:43.750
So you didn't want to marry her?

27:43.834 --> 27:46.709
No. Excuse me.

27:46.792 --> 27:49.166
(Lilly)
And you were for the abortion?

27:49.250 --> 27:51.000
I didn't want to get involved.

27:51.083 --> 27:52.667
(Lilly)
'Then why were you
at the meeting place'

27:52.750 --> 27:54.959
the day Renee went
for the procedure?

27:55.041 --> 27:57.583
She saw your truck, Charlie.

27:57.667 --> 28:01.917
Look, this is 35 years
later. My wife..

28:02.000 --> 28:04.250
No one's talking to your wife.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.458
I followed Renee.

28:11.291 --> 28:13.375
Saw her meet
those
hippies.

28:15.291 --> 28:16.709
And?

28:17.625 --> 28:20.917
I tailed the car to West Philly.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.959
- Where's Renee?
- Be cool, man. Shut that
door.

28:23.041 --> 28:24.583
- She in here?
- No, this is a private home.

28:24.667 --> 28:26.417
You can't just
crash in here.

28:26.500 --> 28:27.709
I'm gonna call the cops.

28:27.792 --> 28:30.625
No. No, you don't wanna do that.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.792
But look at you,
you're just a kid.

28:32.875 --> 28:35.208
- How old are you?
- 17.

28:35.291 --> 28:36.875
You want a baby at 18?

28:36.959 --> 28:40.375
And a wife before
your senior prom?

28:47.000 --> 28:50.750
Look, how about
some air, brother?

28:52.458 --> 28:54.000
Come on.

29:04.250 --> 29:07.667
I cried on that hippie's
shoulder for ten minutes.

29:07.750 --> 29:09.542
Then what?

29:09.625 --> 29:10.959
'Nothing.'

29:11.041 --> 29:12.834
Home.

29:15.291 --> 29:17.667
Where were you two hours
later that day?

29:17.750 --> 29:19.083
Home.

29:19.625 --> 29:21.333
With anyone?

29:21.417 --> 29:24.166
Yeah, my mom.
She's gone now.

29:25.083 --> 29:26.417
That's too bad, Charlie

29:26.500 --> 29:29.959
'cause those hippies
went missing that day.

29:31.125 --> 29:34.333
Look, I didn't want
Renee to do it.

29:34.417 --> 29:38.375
But in retrospect, it
was the right thing for me.

29:38.458 --> 29:41.667
Did you realize that before
or after they died?

29:44.500 --> 29:48.000
Lil, Scotty, we got
the FBI file on Jane.

29:48.083 --> 29:49.417
What, they had a file?

29:49.500 --> 29:51.583
- And they gave it up?
- It's public record now.

29:51.667 --> 29:53.166
(Lilly)
'We get names
of informants?'

29:53.250 --> 29:55.041
No, they drew the line there,
but we did get these.

29:55.125 --> 29:57.875
Yeah, surveillance photos
of the Jane volunteers.

29:57.959 --> 30:01.333
Julia and Gerard, picking up
and dropping off women

30:01.417 --> 30:03.709
'April through
June of '69.'

30:03.792 --> 30:05.750
This your young Renee?

30:07.291 --> 30:08.542
(Lilly)
'That's her.'

30:08.625 --> 30:10.792
Then this was the day
they disappeared.

30:10.875 --> 30:12.208
Someone else was there.

30:12.291 --> 30:15.208
Someone who took these photos
and gave them to the Feds.

30:15.291 --> 30:17.000
An informant.

30:17.083 --> 30:18.792
That nut case Lionel was right.

30:18.875 --> 30:21.625
Lionel thought Gerard
was a snitch.

30:23.333 --> 30:25.000
Gerard
didn't
take these.

30:27.208 --> 30:29.125
So who did?

30:32.792 --> 30:34.208
Informants?

30:34.291 --> 30:35.542
Sound off the wall?

30:35.625 --> 30:37.625
Sounds dated.

30:37.709 --> 30:40.083
Our case is dated.

30:40.166 --> 30:42.834
There were always
rumors like that.

30:42.917 --> 30:45.041
It was like a parlor
game at the commune

30:45.125 --> 30:48.834
trying to decide
who the snitch
was.

30:48.917 --> 30:50.083
Weird.

30:50.166 --> 30:52.417
It was a paranoid time.

30:52.500 --> 30:55.417
Well, it seems there was
someone watching Julia.

30:56.333 --> 30:58.417
Then I guess it wasn't paranoia.

30:58.500 --> 31:02.250
So in the parlor game,
who'd you suspect?

31:03.542 --> 31:05.834
It wasn't a suspicion.

31:07.333 --> 31:08.875
Intuition?

31:10.834 --> 31:13.417
Adam and Julia
were non-monogamous.

31:13.500 --> 31:15.625
(Scotty)
'He told us.'

31:16.583 --> 31:19.291
And I..

31:19.375 --> 31:22.417
Had first-hand
knowledge of that?

31:22.500 --> 31:24.291
Yes.

31:24.375 --> 31:27.834
'Granted, I was sort of
tripping at the time.'

31:34.250 --> 31:36.500
(Terri)
'It's so fragile.'

31:38.375 --> 31:40.083
Can I take its picture?

31:42.291 --> 31:43.709
Oh..

31:54.709 --> 31:56.959
These are great.

31:57.041 --> 31:59.667
I'm documenting the movement.

31:59.750 --> 32:01.333
Yeah?

32:01.417 --> 32:03.917
I'm gonna do
a book someday..

32:04.000 --> 32:05.875
...tell the story.

32:07.083 --> 32:09.417
I love this one of Julia.

32:12.625 --> 32:14.458
(Adam)
'Yeah.'

32:14.542 --> 32:16.250
Have any of me?

32:17.917 --> 32:20.166
I'll take some right now.

32:24.250 --> 32:30.125
How about a rich Jersey girl
beds penniless draft dodger.

32:31.583 --> 32:33.917
The camera was
pretty sophisticated

32:34.000 --> 32:36.166
for a guy like him.

32:36.250 --> 32:42.375
It came into my mind for a
second but I was so flattered

32:42.458 --> 32:44.375
that he considered me
part of the movement

32:44.458 --> 32:47.083
I put it out again.

32:47.166 --> 32:49.250
He ever put
out that
book?

32:53.667 --> 32:55.750
(Scotty)
'Boss, we got something.'

32:55.834 --> 32:57.125
Yeah, us, too.

32:57.208 --> 33:01.417
Adam Clarke burning
his draft card in '69.

33:01.500 --> 33:03.250
He told us about that.

33:03.333 --> 33:05.750
(John)
'Problem is, Adam shouldn't
have had a draft card in
'69.'

33:05.834 --> 33:07.291
We checked his
military
records.

33:07.375 --> 33:10.041
- He'd already served.
- Vietnam, '66 until '67.

33:10.125 --> 33:11.375
Really?

33:11.458 --> 33:13.625
When Adam gets home,
it gets more
interesting.

33:13.709 --> 33:15.125
He crossed
state lines

33:15.208 --> 33:18.208
driving a peace
van
loaded with weed.

33:18.291 --> 33:20.709
Arrested for drug sales.

33:20.792 --> 33:22.792
Thought he was too
disorganized for
that.

33:22.875 --> 33:24.291
The case should have
bought him state
time.

33:24.375 --> 33:26.250
But then the Feds
took
over jurisdiction.

33:26.333 --> 33:28.041
Poof. Case went away.

33:28.125 --> 33:29.667
He made a deal
with them.

33:29.750 --> 33:31.417
Became a CI.

33:31.500 --> 33:33.250
Stay in the
movement,
keep us informed.

33:33.333 --> 33:35.542
Now those photos he had
of Julia really make sense.

33:35.625 --> 33:38.166
Black and
white,
long lens.

33:38.250 --> 33:40.667
(Lilly)
Adam Clarke, '60s babe magnet

33:40.750 --> 33:43.041
star of the anti-war movement.

33:43.125 --> 33:45.166
And FBI informant.

33:45.250 --> 33:47.583
- That'd be big news.
- Big, bad news.

33:47.667 --> 33:49.583
And if Julia found out?

33:49.667 --> 33:52.125
There's your
motive
for murder.

33:56.834 --> 33:59.250
Do you mind?

33:59.333 --> 34:01.208
Not at all.

34:12.375 --> 34:15.291
I know why
you're
here, Lilly.

34:15.375 --> 34:17.250
Yeah?

34:17.333 --> 34:20.875
I was an informant
for the FBI in
1969.

34:22.125 --> 34:23.250
Go on.

34:23.333 --> 34:24.750
My old case
agent
called.

34:24.834 --> 34:28.375
Gave me a heads up.
Questions were being
asked.

34:28.458 --> 34:31.166
- They didn't give us names.
- I know.

34:31.250 --> 34:34.959
And when you told me
about Julia and
Gerard

34:35.041 --> 34:40.000
I-I hoped that my background
was irrelevant, but..

34:43.000 --> 34:44.834
...it may not be.

34:46.709 --> 34:51.000
I was surveilling them
the day they
disappeared.

34:53.083 --> 34:56.500
June 3, 1969.

34:56.583 --> 34:59.250
7:20 a.m.

34:59.333 --> 35:01.834
Yeah. This guy's name
is Charlie Rinzler.

35:01.917 --> 35:03.542
I-I know who he is.

35:03.625 --> 35:04.875
Is-is that all
you have of him?

35:04.959 --> 35:06.917
Oh, he was so agitated

35:07.000 --> 35:08.834
I reported it
to my case
agent.

35:08.917 --> 35:12.250
The Feds ran his license,
had me follow him for a
week

35:12.333 --> 35:13.917
but nothing much came of it.

35:15.083 --> 35:16.750
So, you have photos of Charlie

35:16.834 --> 35:20.166
from the week after Julia
and Gerard went missing?

35:20.250 --> 35:23.417
Yeah, but
nothing
too exciting.

35:23.500 --> 35:26.792
- Can I see them anyway?
- Mmm.

35:26.875 --> 35:30.000
'I basically followed him
every day for a week'

35:30.083 --> 35:31.208
to and from work.

35:31.291 --> 35:34.542
He was a day
worker,
in construction.

35:37.125 --> 35:39.083
Can I take these?

35:42.917 --> 35:44.542
They're yours..

35:44.625 --> 35:47.625
...if I can ask a favor.

35:49.041 --> 35:52.291
If we can keep your
secret, we will.

35:57.583 --> 36:00.417
You worked construction
back
in the 60s, huh, Charlie?

36:00.500 --> 36:02.500
Yeah, couple summers.

36:02.583 --> 36:04.542
Remember a job
at the Calvin
building

36:04.625 --> 36:05.709
summer of '69?

36:05.792 --> 36:08.542
- 'Putting down the
foundation?'
- Maybe.

36:08.625 --> 36:09.750
'Cause that just happens

36:09.834 --> 36:11.750
to be where Julia
and Gerard were dumped.

36:11.834 --> 36:13.750
'The same week
you worked there.'

36:13.834 --> 36:15.083
'It's an amazing
coincidence.'

36:15.166 --> 36:17.709
Mm, too amazing.

36:17.792 --> 36:19.583
That-that can't be right.

36:20.792 --> 36:23.625
This is you at the
construction site, Charlie.

36:25.041 --> 36:27.417
- Who the hell took that?
- Good luck you had.

36:27.500 --> 36:28.834
That foundation was being laid

36:28.917 --> 36:31.041
just when you needed
to stash two dead hippies.

36:31.125 --> 36:33.083
I never hurt them.

36:35.041 --> 36:36.750
That guy was nice to me.

36:36.834 --> 36:40.291
Long as that building was up,
you figured you were home free.

36:40.375 --> 36:43.208
Too bad they want
a parking lot there now.

36:43.291 --> 36:45.000
It's coincidence.

36:45.083 --> 36:46.792
That's all.

36:51.667 --> 36:53.250
I guess I need a lawyer.

36:55.959 --> 36:57.709
Update for you.

37:02.625 --> 37:05.709
Forensics is back on the
hair
found with the bodies.

37:05.792 --> 37:07.333
And?

37:07.417 --> 37:08.583
It ain't Julia's.

37:08.667 --> 37:09.834
So, there was
someone else

37:09.917 --> 37:11.750
at the scene
with long, brown hair.

37:11.834 --> 37:12.875
Charlie?

37:12.959 --> 37:14.834
- He was Nixon youth.
- Crew cut.

37:14.917 --> 37:17.959
- How about Adam Clarke?
- 'Long.'

37:18.041 --> 37:20.125
Yeah, but a lot of people
had long hair back then.

37:20.208 --> 37:22.291
And Adam came clean
about being an informant.

37:22.375 --> 37:23.959
FBI wasn't gonna confirm.

37:24.041 --> 37:26.125
Put himself right in harm's way.

37:26.208 --> 37:29.333
Unless he practices
what he preaches.

37:32.750 --> 37:34.709
"People who win
face the real facts

37:34.792 --> 37:36.500
"of whatever situation
they're in."

37:36.583 --> 37:38.291
Maybe he looked at the odds

37:38.375 --> 37:39.667
knew we'd make him
as the informant

37:39.750 --> 37:41.208
with or without confirmation.

37:41.291 --> 37:43.417
So he steps out ahead of us.

37:43.500 --> 37:44.709
Makes himself look good.

37:44.792 --> 37:46.959
And sets up Charlie.

37:47.041 --> 37:49.291
"Audacious action,
with the element of surprise

37:49.375 --> 37:50.750
"will give you the upper hand."

37:50.834 --> 37:53.041
We know Adam followed
Charlie around for a week.

37:53.125 --> 37:54.375
He saw where he worked.

37:54.458 --> 37:56.125
Could've dumped the bodies
there one night.

37:56.208 --> 37:59.000
Which points right to Charlie
if anything ever comes to
light.

37:59.083 --> 38:02.333
And Adam gets 35 years
to have a life

38:02.417 --> 38:03.667
till his luck runs out.

38:03.750 --> 38:05.500
We got enough to compel
a DNA sample?

38:05.583 --> 38:07.875
I mean, this guy
ain't gonna give it up.

38:07.959 --> 38:10.083
He already did.

38:14.750 --> 38:17.500
Those pictures, they
were real helpful,
Adam.

38:17.583 --> 38:19.041
I'm glad.

38:19.125 --> 38:20.542
You're an excellent
photographer.

38:20.625 --> 38:22.709
I mean, composition, framing.

38:22.792 --> 38:24.625
Especially framing.

38:24.709 --> 38:26.041
How'd it go down, anyway?

38:26.125 --> 38:29.709
You get sloppy that day,
Julia and Gerard catch you?

38:29.792 --> 38:32.125
I...don't follow.

38:32.208 --> 38:33.750
Charlie didn't kill them.

38:33.834 --> 38:34.875
Good try, though.

38:34.959 --> 38:36.792
I never said he did.

38:36.875 --> 38:41.792
Adam Clarke, real
hippie or...poser?

38:42.792 --> 38:44.083
Real.

38:44.166 --> 38:46.250
My passions were very real.

38:47.458 --> 38:49.500
How'd you like
having long
hair?

38:49.583 --> 38:51.625
All them strands blowing around.

38:51.709 --> 38:53.125
And guess what, Adam?

38:53.208 --> 38:55.375
One of them blew right
into the plastic bags

38:55.458 --> 38:57.375
you wrapped your friends in.

38:57.458 --> 38:58.959
Got stuck under the tape.

38:59.041 --> 39:02.125
A long, brown hair that don't
belong to either of them.

39:02.208 --> 39:04.750
You think I was the only
guy with long hair

39:04.834 --> 39:06.417
those two were in contact with?

39:06.500 --> 39:10.291
Well, the DNA on
this
will confirm it.

39:11.709 --> 39:14.917
Whether you were a real
hippie
or not doesn't matter.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.250
Your long hair
got you in the
end.

39:17.333 --> 39:19.250
(Scotty)
'Why'd you do it Adam?'

39:19.333 --> 39:21.792
Were you against
what Jane was doing?

39:23.375 --> 39:25.875
I thought they were heroic.

39:27.041 --> 39:30.458
I didn't want Julia
or Gerard to be harmed.

39:30.542 --> 39:32.959
(Scotty)
'But then they found
out about you.'

39:33.041 --> 39:34.333
Pretty soon the whole movement

39:34.417 --> 39:37.417
would know you were
a snitch for the FBI.

39:38.667 --> 39:41.000
The Feds had me.

39:41.083 --> 39:42.583
I had no options.

39:42.667 --> 39:45.458
Well, how about
taking responsibility?

39:45.542 --> 39:47.333
'Ain't that
the winner's way?'

39:48.375 --> 39:50.959
I was a leader
in the revolution.

39:52.333 --> 39:55.166
We were living like
it meant something.

39:57.333 --> 39:59.291
I loved that life.

40:00.375 --> 40:03.125
Couldn't stand to give it up.

40:03.208 --> 40:05.792
Ever wonder if Julia
and Gerard felt that way?

40:07.041 --> 40:09.333
Think they loved their lives?

40:52.291 --> 40:54.500
Hey, Jules.
Gerard.

40:57.041 --> 40:58.166
What are you guys
doing here?

40:58.250 --> 40:59.542
(Julia)
What's going on, Adam?

40:59.625 --> 41:01.500
You taking
our picture?

41:01.583 --> 41:02.917
I'm always taking pictures.

41:03.000 --> 41:06.625
Yeah, what 8:00 in the
morning,
on a deserted corner?

41:06.709 --> 41:08.709
I-I don't get this.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.667
Oh, man.

41:12.667 --> 41:14.834
This is sad.

41:14.917 --> 41:16.041
He's a snitch.

41:16.125 --> 41:17.500
Come on. Adam Clarke?

41:17.583 --> 41:19.709
Who better?

41:19.792 --> 41:21.709
This is crazy, right?

41:24.375 --> 41:27.125
Let's...let's get in the car.

41:27.208 --> 41:28.166
(Julia)
'Adam.'

41:28.250 --> 41:29.458
Just do it, Jules.

41:29.542 --> 41:31.291
The man of peace and love
has a handgun?

41:31.375 --> 41:32.875
No, he ain't that man at all.

41:32.959 --> 41:35.125
Just get in the car.

41:45.333 --> 41:47.959
Crank the radio, Gerard.

41:57.166 --> 41:58.917
Turn it up.

42:10.041 --> 42:11.625
[crying]
No!

42:20.333 --> 42:21.583
Adam.

42:24.208 --> 42:25.667
Adam, please, no.

42:26.917 --> 42:28.458
I'm sorry.
