ANDREW COLLINS:
Gobekli Tepe is the smoking gun

00:06.290 --> 00:09.210
of a lost civilization
because it confirms that,

00:09.210 --> 00:11.300
at the time of the last ice age,

00:11.300 --> 00:13.760
there was high culture existing
in the world.

00:13.760 --> 00:17.550
ROBERT SCHOCH: Gobekli Tepe's an
incredibly sophisticated site.

00:17.550 --> 00:19.260
There's a very important message

00:19.260 --> 00:22.140
they were purposefully
sending to us.

00:23.980 --> 00:25.350
DAVID WILCOCK:
We're actually seeing

00:25.350 --> 00:28.860
architecture
in the Cygnus star system,

00:28.860 --> 00:33.240
just like what they paid homage
to at Gobekli Tepe.

00:33.240 --> 00:35.530
GIORGIO TSOUKALOS:
Only five percent

00:35.530 --> 00:38.450
of Gobekli Tepe
has been unearthed so far.

00:38.450 --> 00:42.080
So, what other surprises
will we find there?

00:42.080 --> 00:46.040
COLLINS: We need to know
about our origins.

00:46.040 --> 00:49.290
We need to know our destiny.

00:49.290 --> 00:53.170
And all of it lies under
the surface of Gobekli Tepe.

00:53.170 --> 00:55.090

01:25.040 --> 01:26.960
NARRATOR:
Sanliurfa, Turkey.

01:26.960 --> 01:29.880
October 1994.

01:29.880 --> 01:32.500
While plowing his field,

01:32.500 --> 01:36.840
shepherd Savak Yildiz
spots a strangely shaped stone

01:36.840 --> 01:39.260
protruding from the ground.

01:39.260 --> 01:42.060
After brushing away the dirt,

01:42.060 --> 01:46.520
he realizes that it may be
part of a much larger object.

01:48.100 --> 01:51.520
Shortly after contacting
the local museum with his find,

01:51.520 --> 01:54.190
he is visited by Klaus Schmidt

01:54.190 --> 01:57.990
from the German
Archaeological Institute.

01:57.990 --> 02:00.450
It wasn't until German
archaeologist Klaus Schmidt

02:00.450 --> 02:03.950
visited the site
and began digging,

02:03.950 --> 02:07.210
they realized what was
really at this site.

02:07.210 --> 02:09.170
What he discovered
was mind‐blowing.

02:09.170 --> 02:11.750
After discovering
the first T‐shaped pillar

02:11.750 --> 02:13.380
buried at the site,

02:13.380 --> 02:16.670
he soon found more
of these massive structures.

02:16.670 --> 02:19.760
NARRATOR:
During the intensive dig,

02:19.760 --> 02:21.600
Schmidt and his team

02:21.600 --> 02:25.470
begin to unearth dozens of
additional giant stone monoliths

02:25.470 --> 02:27.890
covered in intricate carvings,

02:27.890 --> 02:30.770
some weighing
as much as 20 tons.

02:30.770 --> 02:32.770
PAUL BAHN:
The site of Gobekli Tepe

02:32.770 --> 02:36.360
is a series
of circular enclosures.

02:36.360 --> 02:38.450
But then, in the center
of each enclosure,

02:38.450 --> 02:42.120
you have two particularly big
T‐shaped pillars of limestone

02:42.120 --> 02:44.030
sort of facing each other.

02:44.030 --> 02:48.460
Now, many of these pillars have
remarkable carvings on them,

02:48.460 --> 02:50.920
wonderful carvings
and bas‐reliefs of animals,

02:50.920 --> 02:53.540
birds, insects,
all kinds of things.

02:53.540 --> 02:56.800
So, to fashion those
and carve them and set them up

02:56.800 --> 02:59.840
in these structures
was just absolutely amazing.

02:59.840 --> 03:02.260
NARRATOR:
Archaeologists estimate

03:02.260 --> 03:04.890
that it would have taken
a team of 50 men

03:04.890 --> 03:07.350
an entire week to move just one

03:07.350 --> 03:10.640
of the monolithic pillars
from the limestone quarry

03:10.640 --> 03:13.860
to the top of the hill
where they stand today

03:13.860 --> 03:18.490
and over 300 hours
to carve the bas‐reliefs.

03:18.490 --> 03:22.910
At this rate, each of the five
stone circles unearthed so far

03:22.910 --> 03:26.950
would have required a full year
to be completed.

03:26.950 --> 03:30.910
But why such a monumental site
was built in the first place

03:30.910 --> 03:34.580
remains a mystery.

03:34.580 --> 03:36.880
It's very difficult to know
what the purpose of something

03:36.880 --> 03:39.010
like Gobekli Tepe could be.

03:39.010 --> 03:43.010
And certainly Klaus Schmidt
had not reached any conclusions,

03:43.010 --> 03:45.100
except that it's clearly not
a settlement.

03:45.100 --> 03:48.560
It's not a village. There is
absolutely no domestic refuse.

03:48.560 --> 03:53.150
Schmidt always hoped
that it was funerary

03:53.150 --> 03:55.560
and that there would be burials
underneath the walls

03:55.560 --> 03:57.360
or underneath some of
the pillars or so on.

03:57.360 --> 03:59.650
But so far,
they have not yet found

03:59.650 --> 04:02.360
any human remains at the site.

04:02.360 --> 04:04.740
There are no domestic plants
in the site.

04:04.740 --> 04:07.450
There are only
wild animal bones.

04:07.450 --> 04:09.790
Inevitably, in archaeology,
if we don't know

04:09.790 --> 04:12.160
what something is for,
we think a ritual.

04:12.160 --> 04:14.830
But, really,
it's pure speculation.

04:14.830 --> 04:18.420
NARRATOR: Intrigued by evidence
that the structure might go back

04:18.420 --> 04:20.670
to a Neolithic period,

04:20.670 --> 04:23.880
Klaus Schmidt has
the sediment layers of the site

04:23.880 --> 04:26.720
radiocarbon‐dated.

04:26.720 --> 04:28.930
The results indicated

04:28.930 --> 04:33.480
that the stone structures could
be as much as 12,000 years old,

04:33.480 --> 04:36.100
more than 5,000 years older

04:36.100 --> 04:40.230
than mankind's first known
civilization in Mesopotamia.

04:40.230 --> 04:42.150
More than that,

04:42.150 --> 04:45.240
it would place the construction
of Gobekli Tepe

04:45.240 --> 04:48.160
to a time
when mainstream scholars suggest

04:48.160 --> 04:52.040
humans were roaming the Earth
as hunter‐gatherers.

04:53.370 --> 04:55.920
BAHN:
Well, the site of Gobekli Tepe

04:55.920 --> 04:58.380
really did send shockwaves
through the whole world

04:58.380 --> 05:01.670
of early prehistory,
because we'd never before known

05:01.670 --> 05:04.630
or imagined even
that simple hunter‐gatherers

05:04.630 --> 05:07.840
could produce such spectacular
monumental structures.

05:07.840 --> 05:12.100
Now, in archaeology,
really since it began,

05:12.100 --> 05:14.890
we've always assumed that
hunter‐gatherers were capable

05:14.890 --> 05:17.020
of producing wonderful
works of art‐‐

05:17.020 --> 05:18.860
rock art, cave art,
and things like that.

05:18.860 --> 05:21.610
But we never imagined
that they could come together

05:21.610 --> 05:24.610
in sufficient numbers,
uh, to make, uh,

05:24.610 --> 05:27.990
monumental constructions
like Gobekli Tepe.

05:27.990 --> 05:31.620
NARRATOR: But if
the currently accepted timeline

05:31.620 --> 05:34.450
for mankind's advancement
is correct,

05:34.450 --> 05:37.500
is it possible that
primitive hunter‐gatherers

05:37.500 --> 05:39.130
could have built

05:39.130 --> 05:42.920
such sophisticated
megalithic structures?

05:42.920 --> 05:46.340
Ancient astronaut theorists
say no,

05:46.340 --> 05:48.840
and instead suggest

05:48.840 --> 05:54.100
that Gobekli Tepe was built by
the survivors of a lost society,

05:54.100 --> 05:56.230
one that was
almost entirely wiped out

05:56.230 --> 05:58.270
by a worldwide cataclysm.

05:59.900 --> 06:02.070
And to support their claim,

06:02.070 --> 06:05.690
they point to recent evidence
of a catastrophic event

06:05.690 --> 06:09.360
which many mainstream scientists
believe occurred

06:09.360 --> 06:12.330
at the very end
of the last ice age,

06:12.330 --> 06:14.450
which is believed to have lasted

06:14.450 --> 06:19.960
from roughly 108,000 BC
until nearly 10,000 BC.

06:22.290 --> 06:24.840
COLLINS: Gobekli Tepe
could be the smoking gun

06:24.840 --> 06:27.170
of a lost civilization,

06:27.170 --> 06:30.890
because it confirms that,
at the time of the last ice age,

06:30.890 --> 06:33.510
there was high culture
existing in the world.

06:33.510 --> 06:37.180
This is something that had been
speculated for many years,

06:37.180 --> 06:40.730
but there had not been
the absolute evidence.

06:40.730 --> 06:44.230
Now we could have it.

06:44.230 --> 06:49.530
These engineering skills,
this ordering of society

06:49.530 --> 06:51.870
is something
that must have existed

06:51.870 --> 06:55.620
before the end
of the last ice age.

06:55.620 --> 06:58.660
And arguably even earlier.

06:58.660 --> 07:00.620
DAVID CHILDRESS:
When you look at the time frame

07:00.620 --> 07:02.790
of Gobekli Tepe, it was built

07:02.790 --> 07:05.960
right after
these huge catastrophes

07:05.960 --> 07:08.550
at the end of the last ice age.

07:08.550 --> 07:10.840
And it would seem
that the builders were people

07:10.840 --> 07:14.760
who had survived and had
the knowledge and technology

07:14.760 --> 07:16.640
to build something like this.

07:19.430 --> 07:22.350
NARRATOR: According to
ancient astronaut theorists,

07:22.350 --> 07:25.230
proof of
a lost civilization exists

07:25.230 --> 07:28.610
some 300 miles away
from Gobekli Tepe,

07:28.610 --> 07:31.490
in the form of
a vast underground city

07:31.490 --> 07:33.410
known as Derinkuyu.

07:35.620 --> 07:39.250
It extends
some 13 stories underground

07:39.250 --> 07:42.670
and had the capacity
to support 20,000 people.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.010
Although the site has yet
to be scientifically dated,

07:49.010 --> 07:51.380
some researchers have suggested

07:51.380 --> 07:55.850
that it may have served
as a prehistoric refuge.

07:55.850 --> 08:00.270
Derinkuyu is a multileveled city

08:00.270 --> 08:04.690
that has existed, uh,
since time immemorial.

08:04.690 --> 08:08.070
It was certainly used, uh,
during Christian times.

08:08.070 --> 08:11.610
But there's also evidence that
there's prehistoric activity

08:11.610 --> 08:14.200
going on at these places.

08:14.200 --> 08:18.950
Archaeologists found evidence
of Stone Age tools

08:18.950 --> 08:21.660
going back
to the Paleolithic era.

08:21.660 --> 08:23.620
This is at the time
of the last ice age.

08:23.620 --> 08:28.840
And so it's possible
that our ancestors escaped

08:28.840 --> 08:34.470
the cataclysm and the ice age
deep down inside them.

08:34.470 --> 08:38.350
NARRATOR: But if Derinkuyu
really did serve as refuge

08:38.350 --> 08:40.310
from a catastrophic event,

08:40.310 --> 08:44.690
how might it offer a connection
to Gobekli Tepe?

08:44.690 --> 08:47.560
Perhaps further clues
can be found

08:47.560 --> 08:51.280
by exploring
more recently discovered caves

08:51.280 --> 08:55.360
and the stories suggesting that
they were built upon the orders

08:55.360 --> 08:58.030
of otherworldly beings.

09:02.540 --> 09:06.040
NARRATOR:
Central Anatolia, Turkey.

09:06.040 --> 09:10.500
300 miles from the ancient site
of Gobekli Tepe.

09:10.500 --> 09:13.720
December 28, 2014.

09:16.010 --> 09:20.260
A local crew excavating
for an urban renovation project

09:20.260 --> 09:23.600
stumbles across a strange series
of carved rooms and tunnels

09:23.600 --> 09:26.020
deep underground.

09:26.020 --> 09:28.900
Upon further exploration,

09:28.900 --> 09:33.110
they find the subterranean
network spans several miles

09:33.110 --> 09:36.700
and extends hundreds of feet
below the surface of the Earth,

09:36.700 --> 09:40.870
much like the nearby caves
of Derinkuyu.

09:40.870 --> 09:45.330
COLLINS: What they discovered
was that these caves extended

09:45.330 --> 09:51.750
for a distance of 370 feet
down into the rock.

09:55.260 --> 09:57.300
NARRATOR:
Archaeologists estimate

09:57.300 --> 10:00.350
that more than five million
square feet of rock,

10:00.350 --> 10:04.680
the volume of over 370
Olympic‐size swimming pools,

10:04.680 --> 10:08.650
was removed to carve out
this subterranean city.

10:08.650 --> 10:12.480
Yet there is no evidence of the
extracted material in the area.

10:14.820 --> 10:18.700
This mysterious cave system
is still under excavation

10:18.700 --> 10:21.120
and closed to the public.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.620
But in June 2017,

10:23.620 --> 10:26.330
author and researcher
Andrew Collins

10:26.330 --> 10:30.000
was granted access to the site.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.920
The sheer size of some of these
rooms is absolutely amazing.

10:33.920 --> 10:38.470
I mean, this one that we're in
now is 120 feet in length.

10:38.470 --> 10:42.470
And yet it's just one of
hundreds of similar rooms

10:42.470 --> 10:46.470
that we find inside
this great hill.

10:46.470 --> 10:50.850
These tunnels that you see
seem to go on and on.

10:50.850 --> 10:52.940
And yet what's incredible

10:52.940 --> 10:55.820
is that not only were
they full of people,

10:55.820 --> 10:58.190
but there was also livestock
down here.

10:58.190 --> 11:03.160
And we are told that
as many as 20,000 people,

11:03.160 --> 11:05.910
perhaps even as much as 60,000,

11:05.910 --> 11:09.040
could've lived here
at any one time.

11:09.040 --> 11:11.670
NARRATOR:
Not only is there evidence

11:11.670 --> 11:15.090
that these caves once housed
thousands of people,

11:15.090 --> 11:19.050
but archaeologists have found
air vents and water wells

11:19.050 --> 11:21.340
that would have made it possible
to live underground

11:21.340 --> 11:24.100
for years at a time.

11:24.100 --> 11:27.100
These were cut deeply
into the rock,

11:27.100 --> 11:31.270
sometimes for hundreds
of yards in depth.

11:31.270 --> 11:34.400
And at the base of them
were wells

11:34.400 --> 11:38.570
that provided water to these
underground populations.

11:43.280 --> 11:47.040
This is what is known
as a self‐sealing door.

11:47.040 --> 11:50.910
And they're in fact
huge great stone wheels

11:50.910 --> 11:54.710
made of a volcanic rock
known as basalt.

11:54.710 --> 11:57.750
And their function was
that they would be wheeled

11:57.750 --> 12:00.670
into position
so that they would lock,

12:00.670 --> 12:06.140
so that nobody was able to get
inside the underground cities.

12:10.640 --> 12:12.600
NARRATOR:
When it was discovered,

12:12.600 --> 12:14.650
historians recovered artifacts

12:14.650 --> 12:17.270
that suggest
the cave system was used

12:17.270 --> 12:20.440
by the early Christians
to escape persecution.

12:20.440 --> 12:26.030
So they dated the site to be
approximately 1,500 years old.

12:26.030 --> 12:32.040
But based on new evidence,
the caves might be much older.

12:32.040 --> 12:33.870
COLLINS:
A few years ago,

12:33.870 --> 12:38.590
I interviewed an archaeologist
by the name of Omer Demir.

12:38.590 --> 12:42.840
And he found within it
Paleolithic tools,

12:42.840 --> 12:46.550
tools that went back
at least 10,000 to 12,000 years,

12:46.550 --> 12:49.180
and arguably even earlier still.

12:51.680 --> 12:53.940
NARRATOR:
If these caves can be dated

12:53.940 --> 12:56.690
to at least 12,000 years ago‐‐

12:56.690 --> 12:59.400
around the same time
archaeologists believe

12:59.400 --> 13:02.650
the nearby site of Gobekli Tepe
was constructed‐‐

13:02.650 --> 13:04.610
just who built them?

13:04.610 --> 13:08.370
And what drove the builders
underground?

13:10.450 --> 13:13.790
Ancient astronaut theorists
suggest clues can be found

13:13.790 --> 13:16.250
not embedded in stone,

13:16.250 --> 13:20.300
but in the pages of
ancient Persian religious texts.

13:26.720 --> 13:29.430
Zoroastrianism
is one of the world's

13:29.430 --> 13:34.520
oldest monotheistic religions,
founded by the prophet Zoroaster

13:34.520 --> 13:38.350
in ancient Iran
approximately 3,500 years ago.

13:40.400 --> 13:42.480
The central figure
of the religion

13:42.480 --> 13:45.700
was a powerful god
named Ahura Mazda,

13:45.700 --> 13:49.450
who is often depicted
seated inside a winged disk.

13:49.450 --> 13:52.200
According to the story,

13:52.200 --> 13:55.290
recorded in a text
known as the Vendidad,

13:55.290 --> 13:58.830
he sent a powerful warning
to a young priest named Yima

13:58.830 --> 14:00.670
about a coming cataclysm.

14:02.920 --> 14:06.010
Ahura Mazda told
the great early king Yima

14:06.010 --> 14:08.260
that there would be
a terrible disaster.

14:08.260 --> 14:12.890
A giant serpent would descend
from the heavens to the Earth.

14:12.890 --> 14:14.600
Well, that sounds like a comet

14:14.600 --> 14:17.350
or a large meteorite
falling to Earth.

14:20.190 --> 14:24.570
Then a winter would come
such as has never been known.

14:26.860 --> 14:28.450
NARRATOR:
Prior to the event,

14:28.450 --> 14:31.200
Yima is given
very specific instructions

14:31.200 --> 14:33.620
to build an underground shelter

14:33.620 --> 14:38.710
in order to survive
the coming "giant freeze."

14:38.710 --> 14:42.920
Ahura Mazda instructs Yima
to build a Vara.

14:42.920 --> 14:46.210
This is a huge structure,
two miles long, two miles wide,

14:46.210 --> 14:49.510
an underground hall of sorts

14:49.510 --> 14:53.640
where things can be protected
from the terrible winter.

14:55.680 --> 14:58.770
Yima was to hide
a remnant of the people,

14:58.770 --> 15:01.350
and an extensive seed bank,

15:01.350 --> 15:05.440
also a pair of each
of the animal species.

15:05.440 --> 15:08.440
Once Yima is finished
building the Vara,

15:08.440 --> 15:13.490
he takes 2,000 people in,
a representation of mankind.

15:13.490 --> 15:16.700
They are there for 150 years,

15:16.700 --> 15:19.250
but when the winter is over
and they come out,

15:19.250 --> 15:21.210
it is a barren world.

15:21.210 --> 15:24.710
They will have to rebuild
civilization from scratch.

15:24.710 --> 15:29.050
CHILDRESS: The Vara is
supposed to be a huge enclosure

15:29.050 --> 15:33.800
that not only houses
a large number of people,

15:33.800 --> 15:36.510
but also animals and seeds.

15:36.510 --> 15:39.480
It's a storehouse
just like Noah's Ark.

15:39.480 --> 15:41.940
So you've got this same story,

15:41.940 --> 15:45.110
and it would seem
that this is a very real thing

15:45.110 --> 15:48.570
that ancient people
knew about and wrote about.

15:51.990 --> 15:54.410
NARRATOR: Could it be
that the story of Noah's Ark

15:54.410 --> 15:58.870
and the Vara of Zoastrianism
are one in the same?

15:58.870 --> 16:01.830
And the reference to an ark

16:01.830 --> 16:05.920
was later misunderstood
to be a large ship?

16:05.920 --> 16:09.760
But if these accounts
are in fact true,

16:09.760 --> 16:13.550
how is it that mankind
had enough advance warning

16:13.550 --> 16:16.800
to build such sophisticated
places of refuge?

16:19.390 --> 16:22.810
The ancient texts are very clear
that the gods,

16:22.810 --> 16:27.190
they always warned people

16:27.190 --> 16:31.400
that this catastrophe would
happen so that they would save

16:31.400 --> 16:34.610
a select group
of that population.

16:34.610 --> 16:37.370
So how was that possible?

16:37.370 --> 16:42.080
Either they had access to
sophisticated technologies

16:42.080 --> 16:44.120
with which to predict
the weather,

16:44.120 --> 16:46.630
or what's the other option?

16:46.630 --> 16:52.170
And if you combine that with the
fact that Ahura Mazda was known

16:52.170 --> 16:56.720
to have descended from the sky
in a vehicle with fixed wings‐‐

16:56.720 --> 16:59.850
it looks like some type
of flying device‐‐

16:59.850 --> 17:02.730
that would suggest

17:02.730 --> 17:05.900
that he was in fact
an extraterrestrial.

17:08.230 --> 17:11.070
NARRATOR: According to
ancient astronaut theorists,

17:11.070 --> 17:15.240
the Vara described
in the ancient Zoroastrian texts

17:15.240 --> 17:18.030
is strikingly similar
to the recently discovered

17:18.030 --> 17:21.870
subterranean town
in Central Anatolia.

17:21.870 --> 17:24.660
HENRY:
The underground caves in Turkey

17:24.660 --> 17:27.120
sound exactly like the Vara

17:27.120 --> 17:30.340
that was made by Yima
in Zoroastrian mythology.

17:30.340 --> 17:32.760
Is it possible
that this cave system

17:32.760 --> 17:35.470
supplies the evidence
that tells us

17:35.470 --> 17:39.470
that the Zoroastrian mythology
is in fact a real, true story?

17:41.680 --> 17:43.850
NARRATOR:
If these caves provide evidence

17:43.850 --> 17:45.850
that the account recorded

17:45.850 --> 17:49.440
in the ancient Zoroastrian texts
is factual,

17:49.440 --> 17:52.110
did the inhabitants
of the Vara emerge

17:52.110 --> 17:54.320
to find a barren wasteland

17:54.320 --> 17:57.280
where they were
to rebuild civilization?

17:57.280 --> 18:00.030
Might they be responsible

18:00.030 --> 18:02.490
for the construction
of Gobekli Tepe,

18:02.490 --> 18:05.620
located only 300 miles away?

18:05.620 --> 18:09.460
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

18:09.460 --> 18:13.000
and suggest
that this very connection

18:13.000 --> 18:17.260
could help explain some of the
mysterious figures immortalized

18:17.260 --> 18:19.760
in the stone carvings.

18:27.270 --> 18:32.110
NARRATOR:
Gobekli Tepe, 2017.

18:32.110 --> 18:35.320
To date,
69 massive stone pillars

18:35.320 --> 18:37.650
have been unearthed
at the ancient site,

18:37.650 --> 18:40.820
after more than two decades
of excavation.

18:43.200 --> 18:45.290
More than one‐third
of the statues

18:45.290 --> 18:48.290
contain elaborate carvings
of animals,

18:48.290 --> 18:50.790
including various mammals,

18:50.790 --> 18:54.710
reptiles, insects and birds.

18:54.710 --> 18:57.550
But also included

18:57.550 --> 19:00.510
are depictions of species
not indigenous to the area,

19:00.510 --> 19:06.770
like geese, armadillos
and wild boar.

19:06.770 --> 19:09.940
There are such an incredible
range of animals and birds

19:09.940 --> 19:12.270
and insects depicted
at Gobekli Tepe,

19:12.270 --> 19:13.980
the like of which
we have never seen

19:13.980 --> 19:16.190
at that period or anywhere else
in the world.

19:16.190 --> 19:20.490
And to have a whole bunch of
them together is interesting.

19:20.490 --> 19:23.280
You can speculate
till the cows come home

19:23.280 --> 19:25.240
as to what it might represent.

19:25.240 --> 19:27.410
We have not the faintest idea.

19:27.410 --> 19:29.830
HENRY:
In the story of Noah's Ark,

19:29.830 --> 19:31.830
we're told that
after the deluge,

19:31.830 --> 19:35.670
Noah's Ark lands at Mount Ararat
in eastern Turkey,

19:35.670 --> 19:38.590
not far from Gobekli Tepe,

19:38.590 --> 19:40.930
and we see some very strange
animals portrayed

19:40.930 --> 19:43.140
on the pillars at Gobekli Tepe,

19:43.140 --> 19:47.930
almost as if it's a record
of Noah's Ark itself.

19:47.930 --> 19:52.140
Perhaps Gobekli Tepe
is the place where Noah

19:52.140 --> 19:54.690
and his descendants disembarked

19:54.690 --> 19:57.650
and recreated civilization
after the flood.

19:59.990 --> 20:03.200
NARRATOR: If there really is a
connection between Gobekli Tepe

20:03.200 --> 20:06.240
and the biblical story
of a Great Flood,

20:06.240 --> 20:09.620
could the carvings
found at the site

20:09.620 --> 20:13.250
be an inventory of the animals
that were rescued?

20:13.250 --> 20:18.380
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes, but also suggest

20:18.380 --> 20:22.720
other carvings depict a species
not of this Earth.

20:28.310 --> 20:31.640
At the center of each of the
five megalithic ring structures

20:31.640 --> 20:34.900
that occupy
the archaeological site,

20:34.900 --> 20:38.020
stand two oversized
monolithic pillars.

20:38.020 --> 20:40.820
Weighing up to 20 tons

20:40.820 --> 20:43.740
and reaching heights
of over two stories,

20:43.740 --> 20:47.030
they visually stand apart
from the T‐shaped stonework

20:47.030 --> 20:49.490
that surrounds them.

20:49.490 --> 20:53.040
These pillars are
anthropomorphic;

20:53.040 --> 20:55.540
they are humanlike
in appearance.

20:55.540 --> 21:01.340
They have low relief arms
that come round to the front

21:01.340 --> 21:04.930
and end in these
long, spindly fingers.

21:04.930 --> 21:07.300
They wear garments.

21:07.300 --> 21:11.310
They have belts
with strange symbols.

21:11.310 --> 21:14.600
There are no faces
on these stones.

21:14.600 --> 21:19.110
The heads are represented
by T‐shaped terminations

21:19.110 --> 21:23.030
that look almost like
hammerheads, basically.

21:23.030 --> 21:26.490
BAHN: They could be gods,
they could be ancestors,

21:26.490 --> 21:29.870
or they could be very specific
people who are being venerated.

21:29.870 --> 21:31.410
We really have no idea.

21:32.620 --> 21:35.330
HENRY: The archaeologist
Schmidt himself

21:35.330 --> 21:37.170
referred to them
as the "celestial ones,"

21:37.170 --> 21:39.500
or the "celestial ancestors."

21:39.500 --> 21:41.960
And we have to ask
if these are depictions

21:41.960 --> 21:45.420
of the extraterrestrial gods
at Gobekli Tepe.

21:48.430 --> 21:51.220
NARRATOR: As mysterious
as these statues are,

21:51.220 --> 21:53.770
strikingly similar depictions
can be found

21:53.770 --> 21:57.520
in other parts of the globe.

21:57.520 --> 22:00.980
An interesting feature about
some of these T‐shaped pillars

22:00.980 --> 22:03.860
is the fact
that these arms culminate

22:03.860 --> 22:06.610
in the front
around the navel area.

22:06.610 --> 22:09.490
And what I find so cool
is that this type of motif

22:09.490 --> 22:12.580
can be found elsewhere
around the world.

22:12.580 --> 22:15.200
For example, in Easter Island,

22:15.200 --> 22:17.830
with those giant statues,
the Moai.

22:17.830 --> 22:21.130
There, too,
the arms go around the belly,

22:21.130 --> 22:24.710
and they culminate
in front of the navel.

22:24.710 --> 22:28.130
And then, at Tiahuanaco,
Bolivia, for example,

22:28.130 --> 22:32.390
there is a statue that has
the exact same hand position

22:32.390 --> 22:34.810
in front of the navel.

22:34.810 --> 22:37.140
ED BARNHART:
At the city of Tiahuanaco,

22:37.140 --> 22:41.270
in its central complex
called the Kalasasaya,

22:41.270 --> 22:45.650
is a massive monolithic statue.

22:45.650 --> 22:50.950
The statue is said by the Inca
to be a giant.

22:50.950 --> 22:53.870
In the previous creation
before men,

22:53.870 --> 22:56.120
giants roamed the Earth.

22:56.120 --> 23:00.250
And they inhabited
the city of Tiahuanaco.

23:00.250 --> 23:05.000
And this is actually
very similar to the mythology

23:05.000 --> 23:08.470
of Easter Island and the stories
we hear about the Moai.

23:10.510 --> 23:14.140
We get very similar type
of carved pillars

23:14.140 --> 23:18.020
as Gobekli Tepe
in other parts of the world.

23:18.020 --> 23:21.350
There is a very strong
similarity in style

23:21.350 --> 23:22.980
which tells us

23:22.980 --> 23:26.570
that there is almost certainly
some kind of relationship,

23:26.570 --> 23:29.570
that Gobekli Tepe
is not in isolation,

23:29.570 --> 23:32.570
it's part of some kind
of global culture,

23:32.570 --> 23:34.780
the remnants
of a lost civilization

23:34.780 --> 23:37.790
that once existed
in the prehistoric world.

23:40.710 --> 23:44.130
NARRATOR: Could the figures
found at Gobekli Tepe

23:44.130 --> 23:47.250
and in other parts of the globe
be a record

23:47.250 --> 23:50.010
carved in stone
of an ancient alien race

23:50.010 --> 23:54.090
that existed
prior to a catastrophic event?

23:54.090 --> 23:56.510
If so, might the sites

23:56.510 --> 23:59.560
where these extraterrestrials
are immortalized

23:59.560 --> 24:02.480
be the places
where human survivors emerged

24:02.480 --> 24:05.690
after the event known
as the Great Flood?

24:05.690 --> 24:09.440
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

24:09.440 --> 24:13.360
and suggest that more recent
discoveries at the site

24:13.360 --> 24:17.740
provide additional proof
of this otherworldly connection.

24:26.880 --> 24:28.800
NARRATOR:
Sanliurfa, Turkey.

24:28.800 --> 24:31.010
June 2017.

24:33.840 --> 24:36.260
Author and researcher
Andrew Collins

24:36.260 --> 24:40.350
travels to the Sanliurfa
Archaeology and Mosaic Museum,

24:40.350 --> 24:43.100
just ten miles
from Gobekli Tepe,

24:43.100 --> 24:46.400
to meet with curator
Taha Ozyavuz.

24:46.400 --> 24:48.520
Taha, I presume.
Nice to meet you.

24:48.520 --> 24:50.860
NARRATOR: He is there
to get an up‐close look

24:50.860 --> 24:53.280
at one of the most mysterious
stone structures

24:53.280 --> 24:56.280
unearthed at the ancient site.

24:56.280 --> 24:59.200
COLLINS: I think this is
what we've come to see here.

25:33.490 --> 25:34.610
Right.

25:56.550 --> 25:59.010
COLLINS:
And the fact that we have

25:59.010 --> 26:02.560
three different figures here,
each of different sizes,

26:02.560 --> 26:05.060
what do you think
that represents?

26:19.870 --> 26:23.040
Why do you think that
it was damaged or destroyed

26:23.040 --> 26:25.250
in this way in antiquity?

26:32.460 --> 26:34.550
COLLINS:
So somebody came along

26:34.550 --> 26:36.550
and deliberately destroyed it.

26:42.050 --> 26:45.140
NARRATOR: If the stone column
found at Gobekli Tepe

26:45.140 --> 26:48.060
represents a genetic lineage,

26:48.060 --> 26:53.070
just why were two of the figures
deliberately defaced?

26:53.070 --> 26:57.150
Ancient astronaut theorists
suggest that perhaps it was

26:57.150 --> 26:59.320
an attempt to obscure the truth

26:59.320 --> 27:02.780
about humankind's
otherworldly origins.

27:05.450 --> 27:08.040
WILCOCK: What's curious
about this totem pole

27:08.040 --> 27:11.830
is that there is
essentially a larger being,

27:11.830 --> 27:13.920
perhaps an extraterrestrial,

27:13.920 --> 27:16.420
that has its hands
around this other being

27:16.420 --> 27:18.130
that isn't exactly human

27:18.130 --> 27:20.550
but has human‐like
characteristics.

27:20.550 --> 27:24.220
It could be a primitive human.

27:24.220 --> 27:27.810
This figure appears
to be giving birth,

27:27.810 --> 27:30.480
and the baby that is emerging
from this mother's womb

27:30.480 --> 27:33.360
is clearly a human baby
with a human face.

27:33.360 --> 27:37.780
This suggests possibly that
a breeding experiment took place

27:37.780 --> 27:39.900
leading to the development
of modern humans

27:39.900 --> 27:41.700
as we now know them.

27:43.530 --> 27:45.950
HENRY: The interesting thing
about this is that totem poles

27:45.950 --> 27:48.500
are like a repository
for information.

27:48.500 --> 27:51.460
It's an encyclopedia;
it's like a time capsule.

27:51.460 --> 27:53.630
And so if we have
a genealogical record

27:53.630 --> 27:55.960
in this pillar at Gobekli Tepe,

27:55.960 --> 27:58.300
and we follow
the ultimate extension of it,

27:58.300 --> 28:00.590
and we realize that what
they're possibly telling us

28:00.590 --> 28:04.090
is that their ancestors
were non‐human.

28:04.090 --> 28:06.220
CHILDRESS:
So you have to wonder

28:06.220 --> 28:09.270
if the whole idea was
to preserve information

28:09.270 --> 28:11.850
from our extraterrestrial past

28:11.850 --> 28:15.980
so that future generations
would ultimately decode

28:15.980 --> 28:18.400
the information that's there,

28:18.400 --> 28:22.910
information possibly about
our extraterrestrial creators.

28:24.870 --> 28:26.990
NARRATOR:
Many ancient cultures

28:26.990 --> 28:30.330
have stories of the gods
interacting with early humans

28:30.330 --> 28:33.670
and even breeding with them.

28:33.670 --> 28:35.790
According to The Book of Enoch,

28:35.790 --> 28:38.000
an ancient text
that was stricken

28:38.000 --> 28:41.760
from the Bible's Old Testament
in the 4th century AD,

28:41.760 --> 28:45.340
there was a large‐statured group
of heavenly beings

28:45.340 --> 28:49.810
that descended to Earth
in the remote past.

28:49.810 --> 28:53.730
ARIEL BAR TZADOK: There were
those called the "watchers."

28:53.730 --> 28:58.150
They were to watch humanity,
not get involved.

28:58.150 --> 28:59.820
But they violated
that principle.

28:59.820 --> 29:02.400
They came down to Earth.

29:02.400 --> 29:06.820
And they introduced
science and technology.

29:06.820 --> 29:11.370
And they mingled with,
breeded with,

29:11.370 --> 29:17.500
married human females
and sired children.

29:17.500 --> 29:19.340
Their children,

29:19.340 --> 29:21.710
they were known
as the "fallen ones,"

29:21.710 --> 29:24.170
the Nephilim.

29:24.170 --> 29:27.510
They clearly
would have been recognized today

29:27.510 --> 29:30.060
as human beings.

29:30.060 --> 29:32.470
The only difference was that
they might have been considered

29:32.470 --> 29:35.020
physically of greater stature.

29:35.020 --> 29:38.400
Some claim that they were
ten, 15 feet high.

29:38.400 --> 29:40.440
And this was considered
a corruption,

29:40.440 --> 29:43.320
according to divine law.

29:43.320 --> 29:48.200
And it is taught that it is
because of this corruption

29:48.200 --> 29:52.580
that God intervened
to remove them from the Earth,

29:52.580 --> 29:54.790
and that's
what brought the flood.

29:57.210 --> 29:59.170
ERICH VON DANIKEN:
In the Bible,

29:59.170 --> 30:01.960
you read that some
of the fallen angels

30:01.960 --> 30:04.210
came down on this planet.

30:04.210 --> 30:07.590
These angels had, simply,
sex with humans,

30:07.590 --> 30:11.010
definitely, because the outcome
of it were giants.

30:11.010 --> 30:13.560
So what kind of angels
are these?

30:13.560 --> 30:15.730
Spiritual beings?

30:15.730 --> 30:18.060
No, it was
the extraterrestrials.

30:20.900 --> 30:23.440
NARRATOR: Did the builders
of Gobekli Tepe

30:23.440 --> 30:26.070
attempt to preserve
important information

30:26.070 --> 30:29.990
about what happened here
on Earth over 12,000 years ago?

30:32.030 --> 30:33.910
And does this include a record

30:33.910 --> 30:38.830
of the creation of mankind
by extraterrestrial beings?

30:38.830 --> 30:43.170
Ancient astronaut theorists
suggest an even greater mystery

30:43.170 --> 30:47.840
can be found by examining the
remaining structures at the site

30:47.840 --> 30:50.840
that point us to the stars.

30:57.140 --> 31:00.270
NARRATOR:
Gobekli Tepe, 2003.

31:01.940 --> 31:04.690
While using geomagnetic surveys,

31:04.690 --> 31:08.150
archaeologists discover
that the five stone circles

31:08.150 --> 31:10.110
unearthed at the site

31:10.110 --> 31:13.660
only scratch the surface
of what lies buried below.

31:16.120 --> 31:19.000
Not only do the enclosures
appear to have been built

31:19.000 --> 31:22.330
in different layers,
one on top of the other,

31:22.330 --> 31:26.170
but there is evidence
of 16 more identical stone rings

31:26.170 --> 31:29.510
buried at deeper levels
in the mound.

31:29.510 --> 31:31.220
NEWMAN: One of the most
interesting things

31:31.220 --> 31:34.140
about Gobekli Tepe is the fact
that not only did they

31:34.140 --> 31:36.680
construct one of the most
amazing temples on the Earth

31:36.680 --> 31:39.430
at a time when it shouldn't
have been possible to do it,

31:39.430 --> 31:42.100
they then buried each enclosure

31:42.100 --> 31:45.980
after probably just
a few hundred years of use.

31:45.980 --> 31:49.530
COLLINS: 20 different enclosures
were built.

31:49.530 --> 31:51.490
And each one,

31:51.490 --> 31:54.160
seemingly at the end
of its useful life,

31:54.160 --> 31:59.120
was completely covered over
with rubble and soil

31:59.120 --> 32:03.630
before the next enclosure
was built.

32:03.630 --> 32:06.340
They spent as much time
and energy

32:06.340 --> 32:08.800
covering it over in the end

32:08.800 --> 32:11.590
as they did
building it to begin with.

32:16.470 --> 32:20.180
NARRATOR:
In 2014, author Andrew Collins

32:20.180 --> 32:22.060
published his
groundbreaking book

32:22.060 --> 32:26.020
<i>Gobekli Tepe:</i>
<i>Genesis of the Gods.</i>

32:26.020 --> 32:28.900
In it, he proposes
that the reason

32:28.900 --> 32:31.990
for the multiple reconstructions
of the enclosures

32:31.990 --> 32:35.620
was to precisely track
a specific celestial location.

32:38.200 --> 32:40.540
COLLINS: The first thing
that we looked at

32:40.540 --> 32:45.040
was Enclosure D,
which is the oldest

32:45.040 --> 32:47.590
and the most impressive
of all the structures,

32:47.590 --> 32:50.710
to see where exactly

32:50.710 --> 32:52.840
these twin pillars
may have been facing

32:52.840 --> 32:56.390
11,500 years ago.

32:56.390 --> 33:00.810
One star came up,
and this was Deneb,

33:00.810 --> 33:04.310
the brightest star
in the constellation of Cygnus.

33:08.570 --> 33:11.280
So we then looked
at the twin pillars

33:11.280 --> 33:14.360
in the other enclosures
at Gobekli Tepe.

33:14.360 --> 33:17.700
We find that,
although they're all aligned

33:17.700 --> 33:22.580
roughly either north‐northwest
or south‐southeast,

33:22.580 --> 33:25.000
that there are
slight differences.

33:25.000 --> 33:30.840
And what they appear to be doing
is following the same star

33:30.840 --> 33:36.720
as it moves very gradually
along the local horizon.

33:36.720 --> 33:39.850
SCHOCH: The stone circles
are lined according to stars

33:39.850 --> 33:41.180
that they were looking at.

33:41.180 --> 33:43.560
But because of precession‐‐

33:43.560 --> 33:47.480
the slow change in the stars
over time in the sky‐‐

33:47.480 --> 33:51.320
they had to realign them
periodically.

33:51.320 --> 33:53.320
NARRATOR: Precession occurs
due to the fact

33:53.320 --> 33:57.070
that the Earth's axis rotates
much like a spinning top,

33:57.070 --> 34:00.030
changing the point
of observation over time

34:00.030 --> 34:02.240
for various celestial bodies

34:02.240 --> 34:04.330
from any fixed point
on the planet.

34:08.630 --> 34:12.090
SCHOCH: With the stone circles
at Gobekli Tepe,

34:12.090 --> 34:14.170
they weren't just building them
and covering them over

34:14.170 --> 34:16.420
for ritualistic purposes,

34:16.420 --> 34:18.640
but actually
they were doing this

34:18.640 --> 34:21.930
for what we might call
scientific purposes.

34:21.930 --> 34:24.680
Clearly, there was
something very important

34:24.680 --> 34:28.100
about the constellation
of Cygnus‐‐

34:28.100 --> 34:31.310
something that made these people
want to track its course

34:31.310 --> 34:34.440
over a period of
perhaps 1,500 years.

34:37.320 --> 34:40.120
NARRATOR: Legends of gods
descending from the stars

34:40.120 --> 34:42.620
in the Cygnus constellation
can be found

34:42.620 --> 34:46.660
in traditions across the globe.

34:46.660 --> 34:50.170
In the Mandaean teachings
of ancient Persia,

34:50.170 --> 34:54.000
the throne room of the great god
Abathur‐Muzania

34:54.000 --> 34:59.050
was said to be
the Cygnus constellation.

34:59.050 --> 35:02.890
In the Egyptian tradition,
the goddess of the night sky,

35:02.890 --> 35:06.770
Nuit, was said to have come
directly from Cygnus.

35:06.770 --> 35:09.520
And in the Mayan tradition,

35:09.520 --> 35:12.110
it was said that
the sun god, Kinich Ahau,

35:12.110 --> 35:14.730
descended from there.

35:14.730 --> 35:18.110
So, from traditions
as different as the Persian,

35:18.110 --> 35:20.780
the Egyptian and the Mayan,

35:20.780 --> 35:23.160
we have major deities

35:23.160 --> 35:25.790
coming from
the Cygnus constellation.

35:27.660 --> 35:30.080
TSOUKALOS:
If I were to be a visitor

35:30.080 --> 35:33.540
from another planet
and I wanted to leave behind

35:33.540 --> 35:38.130
a calling card
indicating where I came from,

35:38.130 --> 35:40.970
then I would build structures

35:40.970 --> 35:44.140
with the precise alignment
of a constellation

35:44.140 --> 35:47.060
of my home star system.

35:47.060 --> 35:50.810
So, perhaps the teachers
who were at Gobekli Tepe

35:50.810 --> 35:52.730
came from Cygnus.

35:55.020 --> 35:57.820
NARRATOR: Is it possible that
the builders of Gobekli Tepe

35:57.820 --> 35:59.610
were pointing to the place

35:59.610 --> 36:02.490
where their extraterrestrial
teachers came from

36:02.490 --> 36:05.240
by aligning the site
to that specific location

36:05.240 --> 36:08.080
in the night sky?

36:08.080 --> 36:10.910
In 2015,

36:10.910 --> 36:14.250
NASA officials announced
a curious phenomenon

36:14.250 --> 36:17.420
picked up
by the Kepler space telescope.

36:17.420 --> 36:19.380
It was reported
that a mysterious

36:19.380 --> 36:21.550
dimming and flickering

36:21.550 --> 36:24.890
was coming from a star
in the Cygnus constellation.

36:28.520 --> 36:31.730
And some scientists claim
this might be caused

36:31.730 --> 36:34.690
by an alien megastructure
passing in front of it.

36:36.690 --> 36:39.360
NASA announced that they were
tracking what they called

36:39.360 --> 36:43.610
an "alien megastructure"
around the star of Cygnus.

36:43.610 --> 36:46.950
And the speculation was that,

36:46.950 --> 36:50.750
as they were viewing Cygnus
from time to time,

36:50.750 --> 36:54.750
the star would dim by 22%.

36:54.750 --> 36:58.590
And what they were
surmising was that

36:58.590 --> 37:02.670
some giant structure
around the star

37:02.670 --> 37:06.680
was occasionally blocking
our view of the star itself.

37:09.600 --> 37:11.470
WILCOCK: This is
the most dramatic evidence

37:11.470 --> 37:13.390
of a potential extraterrestrial
civilization

37:13.390 --> 37:18.150
that we have ever seen,
because it's actually an object

37:18.150 --> 37:21.030
orbiting a star that
absolutely should not be there,

37:21.030 --> 37:23.860
according to NASA.

37:23.860 --> 37:27.070
We're actually
seeing architecture

37:27.070 --> 37:29.240
in the Cygnus star system.

37:29.240 --> 37:32.450
It could be what they paid
homage to at Gobekli Tepe,

37:32.450 --> 37:35.210
telling us,
"Look over here, guys.

37:35.210 --> 37:37.080
'X' marks the spot."

37:40.300 --> 37:42.420
NARRATOR:
According to NASA astronomers,

37:42.420 --> 37:44.090
what they are observing

37:44.090 --> 37:47.470
is nearly
1,400 light years away.

37:47.470 --> 37:50.140
This means that,
given the time it takes

37:50.140 --> 37:52.350
for light from Cygnus
to reach Earth,

37:52.350 --> 37:55.390
whatever object is causing
the mysterious dimming

37:55.390 --> 37:59.980
was orbiting the star
at least 1,400 years ago,

37:59.980 --> 38:02.860
and perhaps much earlier.

38:02.860 --> 38:06.570
Could this be further evidence
that Gobekli Tepe

38:06.570 --> 38:09.490
was indeed built
to point to the home planet

38:09.490 --> 38:13.160
of mankind's
extraterrestrial ancestors?

38:13.160 --> 38:16.540
Perhaps further clues
can be found

38:16.540 --> 38:20.000
by examining recent events
unfolding in the region

38:20.000 --> 38:22.340
and efforts
to protect the secrets

38:22.340 --> 38:24.960
that still lie buried
at the site.

38:32.470 --> 38:34.430
NARRATOR:
Kobani, Syria.

38:34.430 --> 38:37.480
June, 2015.

38:37.480 --> 38:41.400
The militant extremist group
known as the Islamic State,

38:41.400 --> 38:44.940
or ISIS, violently
takes control of the city.

38:48.610 --> 38:51.620
During their bloody rampage
through the region,

38:51.620 --> 38:55.950
they systematically
destroy historical relics

38:55.950 --> 38:59.500
and detonate bombs
at various archaeological sites.

39:04.710 --> 39:08.630
A mere 60 miles away,
across the border of Turkey,

39:08.630 --> 39:12.510
archaeologists working at
the site of Gobekli Tepe

39:12.510 --> 39:14.720
stand terrified
as they watch the smoke

39:14.720 --> 39:16.850
rise from the battlefield.

39:16.850 --> 39:19.230
In an effort to protect

39:19.230 --> 39:21.520
the 12,000‐year‐old
stone structures

39:21.520 --> 39:23.190
from the threat of attack,

39:23.190 --> 39:26.690
the Turkish government
stops all excavations

39:26.690 --> 39:28.860
and closes the site
to the public.

39:28.860 --> 39:31.410
They crate the stone monoliths

39:31.410 --> 39:34.160
and relocate
the most valuable artifacts

39:34.160 --> 39:35.910
to a museum nearby.

39:35.910 --> 39:38.870
Over the next 20 years,

39:38.870 --> 39:41.790
the government
will spend $15 million

39:41.790 --> 39:45.670
to secure Gobekli Tepe
by enclosing the area,

39:45.670 --> 39:47.920
covering the site
with a steel‐enforced roof,

39:47.920 --> 39:51.340
and installing
an extensive security system.

39:51.340 --> 39:55.220
Considering at least
80% of Gobekli Tepe

39:55.220 --> 39:58.140
remains hidden
beneath the earth,

39:58.140 --> 40:02.190
archaeologists still have
much to learn about the site.

40:02.190 --> 40:05.060
But as it becomes
dangerously close

40:05.060 --> 40:09.150
to suffering the same fate
as other sites in the region,

40:09.150 --> 40:12.860
could its most profound secrets
be lost forever?

40:14.620 --> 40:17.740
Is it possible
that the Gobekli Tepe builders

40:17.740 --> 40:20.330
were actually
sending us a message?

40:20.330 --> 40:26.210
Yes, the stones seem to suggest
that this was the case.

40:26.210 --> 40:29.090
Perhaps they were giving us
some kind of warning,

40:29.090 --> 40:31.880
or it could be
that they are trying

40:31.880 --> 40:34.640
to tell us the information

40:34.640 --> 40:37.680
that they knew
about celestial beings,

40:37.680 --> 40:40.310
and perhaps even
extraterrestrials,

40:40.310 --> 40:42.350
from the Cygnus constellation.

40:45.100 --> 40:49.480
Gobekli Tepe goes back to
a earlier cycle of civilization

40:49.480 --> 40:51.990
that existed at the end
of the last ice age.

40:51.990 --> 40:55.160
They experienced
catastrophic changes.

40:55.160 --> 40:58.370
So, I am of the opinion

40:58.370 --> 41:00.750
that there's
a very important message

41:00.750 --> 41:03.920
that maybe they were
purposefully sending to us,

41:03.920 --> 41:07.170
at least they were trying
to preserve for posterity,

41:07.170 --> 41:09.210
for future generations.

41:09.210 --> 41:13.130
And we need to figure out
exactly what that message is.

41:14.930 --> 41:18.300
HENRY: Gobekli Tepe points us
back to our origins,

41:18.300 --> 41:20.850
and points directly to the stars

41:20.850 --> 41:23.060
as the source
of where we came from.

41:23.060 --> 41:26.100
Once we accept this,
we will be able

41:26.100 --> 41:28.440
to answer the questions
of where we came from

41:28.440 --> 41:31.440
and ultimately
where we're going as a species.

41:34.490 --> 41:37.870
NARRATOR: Does proof of
mankind's extraterrestrial past

41:37.870 --> 41:41.580
lie buried beneath
the earth at Gobekli Tepe?

41:43.620 --> 41:46.250
Proof that
an advanced civilization

41:46.250 --> 41:51.340
existed on this planet
more than 10,000 years ago?

41:51.340 --> 41:54.170
Perhaps the answers
will be found

41:54.170 --> 41:57.050
not by examining
ancient stone pillars

41:57.050 --> 42:00.300
covered with strange carvings...

42:00.300 --> 42:02.470
but on a star,

42:02.470 --> 42:07.150
one that shines on us
from many light‐years away.
