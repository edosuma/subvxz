WEBVTT

00:09.310 --> 00:11.039
(gasps)

00:11.070 --> 00:12.469
(exhales)

00:12.510 --> 00:14.478
You're hurting me, Bernard.

00:14.510 --> 00:18.378
Oh. It is
a good hurt,

00:18.410 --> 00:20.219
is it not?

00:20.250 --> 00:21.717
(chuckles)

00:23.790 --> 00:25.746
Please, no.

00:25.790 --> 00:27.655
(inhales sharply)

00:27.690 --> 00:29.749
Don't kill me.

00:34.360 --> 00:36.726
(gasping, choking)

00:41.440 --> 00:43.328
Did you write that, Mr. Tierney?

00:43.370 --> 00:45.235
I did.
You produce

00:45.270 --> 00:47.477
this show, Call It Murder?

00:47.510 --> 00:48.579
I do. Proudly.
Oh, I'm glad.

00:48.610 --> 00:49.747
Is that Colin Sweeney?

00:52.150 --> 00:54.675
named Bernard Loomi_s.
You're aware that my client

00:54.720 --> 00:56.381
was found not guilty
of murdering his wife?

00:56.420 --> 00:57.648
I am
aware, but,

00:57.690 --> 00:59.658
again, this character
is not based on him.

00:59.690 --> 01:03.080
I see.
But you cast an actor

01:03.130 --> 01:04.688
who looks just like
Colin Sweeney.

01:04.730 --> 01:07.358
That's a
comadence.

01:07.400 --> 01:09.561
Even though
he has the same occupation,

01:09.600 --> 01:13.297
dresses identically, met
his wife in a similar fashion,

01:13.340 --> 01:15.695
and even though Mr. Sweeney's
wife, like the wife

01:15.740 --> 01:19.107
in your show,
was strangled and found

01:19.140 --> 01:22.541
buried in an orchard, and her
decapitated head was discovered

01:22.580 --> 01:25.242
in Mr. Sweeney's yard, despite
all of these similarities,

01:25.280 --> 01:29.216
you still insist that Mr. Loomis
is not based on Mr. Sweeney?

01:29.250 --> 01:31.218
I do.
Isn't
the only difference

01:31.250 --> 01:33.616
between Mr. Sweeney
and your character

01:33.660 --> 01:36.481
that the latter killed his wife?
Well, I think that
there are many people

01:36.530 --> 01:38.452
who think that Mr. Sweeney
did kilghis wife.

01:38.490 --> 01:40.594
so there's no difference
between the two?
He didn't say that.

01:40.630 --> 01:42.598
Argumentative, Your Honor.

01:42.630 --> 01:44.564
This is galling.
_DIANE:
I Will rephrase.

01:44.600 --> 01:46.636
I don't wish to gall,
Ms. Krause.

01:46.670 --> 01:48.638
Uh, Mr. Tierney,
you were quoted

01:48.670 --> 01:50.638
by the Television Critics
Association

01:50.670 --> 01:52.331
saying,
"All our episodes

01:52.380 --> 01:54.871
are ripped straight
from the headlines."

01:54.910 --> 01:57.401
So which headline was
this episode ripped from?

01:57.450 --> 01:59.611
I was exaggerating.
Not all the episodes.

01:59.650 --> 02:01.515
This one was not.
I see.
The one episode

02:01.550 --> 02:04.678
in which your studio
is being sued for defamation?
Again,

02:04.720 --> 02:06.381
argumentative. Your Honor,
I wish you would admonish

02:06.420 --> 02:08.183
plaintiff's attorney.
And I wish

02:08.220 --> 02:10.688
you'd stop overdramatizing
your objections, Counselor.

02:10.730 --> 02:12.425
I get it.
Sustained.

02:12.460 --> 02:14.826
Talk about how he's
rumlng my reputation.

02:14.860 --> 02:17.658
Mr. Sweeney, please.
Trust me.

02:17.700 --> 02:20.669
So, Mr. Tierney, let's talk
about the casting process

02:20.700 --> 02:22.429
for this role.
How many actors

02:22.470 --> 02:24.700
did you read for the part
of Bernard Loomis?

02:24.740 --> 02:26.708
(phone chimes)

02:31.480 --> 02:34.677
(knocking)

02:35.680 --> 02:37.443
Hi.

02:37.490 --> 02:38.514
Hello.

02:38.550 --> 02:39.517
Thanks for
seeing me.

02:39.560 --> 02:42.358
No problem.

02:42.390 --> 02:43.880
You're doing well.
So are you.

02:43.930 --> 02:47.195
No. I shouldn't have
walked out on that debate.

02:47.230 --> 02:48.822
I listened to
my handlers.

02:48.860 --> 02:51.397
Sometimes they're right,
sometimes they're wrong.

02:51.430 --> 02:52.761
I want to play something
for you.

02:52.800 --> 02:54.631
Are we back-channeling?

02:54.670 --> 02:55.830
We are.

02:55.870 --> 02:57.758
(lisping):
Hello, this is Brian Rogers.

02:57.810 --> 03:01.439
I'm a Rainbow Brigade activist
who just loves Frank Prady.

03:01.480 --> 03:04.506
He's a great supporter of our
cause, and I want to remind you

03:04.550 --> 03:05.903
to support him
and not Alicia...
What is that?

03:05.950 --> 03:08.339
Uh, that's a robocall

03:08.380 --> 03:10.519
put out by your campaign.

03:10.550 --> 03:12.814
No.
Yes.

03:12.860 --> 03:16.489
That doesn't make sense. Gays
are your coalition, not ours.
Oh, this robocall

03:16.530 --> 03:19.499
was sent only
to suburban homes in Evanston.

03:19.530 --> 03:21.498
You understand?
It's a false flag.

03:21.530 --> 03:23.725
It's intended to piss
off conservatives so
they'll send money to you.

03:23.770 --> 03:25.795
I have no knowledge of this.
I didn't think
you did.

03:25.830 --> 03:28.537
That is why I have brought
that knowledge to you.

03:28.570 --> 03:32.301
Frank Prady is a great supporter
of gay marriage.

03:32.340 --> 03:34.877
He wants to focus resources
on Boystown In Lake VIew

03:34.910 --> 03:36.798
and not in Evanston.
You see?
Plays off

03:36.850 --> 03:38.647
all the worst stereotypes.
If you support this, please come

03:38.680 --> 03:40.841
to our rally this Saturday.
(phone chiming)

03:40.880 --> 03:43.019
Excuse me. Sorry.

03:43.050 --> 03:45.382
Yes, hello.

03:45.420 --> 03:46.819
Uh, no, it's Frank.

03:46.860 --> 03:48.680
JOHNNY:
No, we haven't released

03:48.720 --> 03:50.324
any robocalls. Josh!

03:50.360 --> 03:52.726
It was disgusting. The
worst kind of politics.

03:52.760 --> 03:54.728
A lisping voice.
Going out to conservatives.

03:54.760 --> 03:57.320
We didn't do it, Alicia.
Hey, Josh. Have we released

03:57.370 --> 04:00.259
any false flag robocalls?
Three weeks before the election?
Are you kidding me?

04:00.300 --> 04:02.666
We'd-we'd wait
until three days before, maybe.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.564
MARISSA: Do you want anything,
Alicia? There are cookies...

04:04.610 --> 04:06.635
Adults are talking here.
Can you give us a minute?

04:06.680 --> 04:08.329
No, Marissa, come in.
Actually,
Alicia,

04:08.380 --> 04:10.405
we need a minute.
I'd like Marissa to stay.

04:10.450 --> 04:11.644
You mean with the adults?
Are you sure?
Are you in touch

04:11.680 --> 04:12.874
with the PAC,
Jon?
Am I?

04:12.920 --> 04:14.444
No, that would be illegal.

04:14.480 --> 04:17.278
When I wanted the PAC
to stop their attack ads,

04:17.320 --> 04:19.311
I told you and they did.
Yes,

04:19.360 --> 04:20.486
because they knew it was wrong.

04:20.520 --> 04:21.817
Right, Josh?
Yes.

04:22.860 --> 04:25.852
What's @TobyZiegler44?

04:25.890 --> 04:29.326
Excuse me?
TobyZiegler44.
What is it?

04:29.370 --> 04:30.519
It's a campaign Twitter account.
JOSH:
How do you know about it?

04:30.570 --> 04:32.595
Of course.

04:32.640 --> 04:33.937
The chatty body woman.
It's a dormant

04:33.970 --> 04:35.938
Twitter account.
We rarely use it.

04:35.970 --> 04:37.335
And yet we used it last night.

04:37.370 --> 04:38.906
"4th: 40/43-soft.

04:38.940 --> 04:41.909
3rd: 44/44."
JOSH: Can I interrupt here?

04:41.940 --> 04:43.942
The candidate should not
be talking about this.

04:43.980 --> 04:45.675
It's our polling data,
isn't it?

04:45.710 --> 04:47.769
It's a code? 4th Ward.

04:47.820 --> 04:50.880
We're soft there.
40% to Prady's 43%.

04:50.920 --> 04:53.480
It's a message to the PAC,
telling them where to focus

04:53.520 --> 04:54.885
soft money.

04:56.760 --> 04:58.853
Awkward silence.
It is a public

04:58.890 --> 05:01.597
Twitter account. We release
random data anyone can access.

05:01.630 --> 05:03.029
JOSH:
It's not illegal.

05:03.070 --> 05:04.799
It's a loophole
in the campaign laws.
Okay,

05:04.830 --> 05:06.639
this is what I need.
Use your little

05:06.670 --> 05:08.638
decoder ring
and your West Wing tweets

05:08.670 --> 05:12.936
to tell the PAC to stop
these homophobic robocalls.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.971
That's all I ask.

05:15.010 --> 05:16.875
You do know we're behind.

05:16.910 --> 05:19.777
No. Polling has me
within the margin of error.
Not polling.

05:19.820 --> 05:24.382
Cash. Prady got an influx
of late campaign cash.

05:24.420 --> 05:25.978
From where?
No idea.
Maybe out of state.

05:26.020 --> 05:27.908
He's popular in California.

05:30.630 --> 05:32.598
Who's Redmayne?

05:32.630 --> 05:35.497
What?
Redmayne.
I recognize the name,

05:35.530 --> 05:36.929
but I don't know
who it is.
Guy Redmayne.

05:36.970 --> 05:40.098
He's a Democratic mega-donor
out of Phoenix. Why?

05:40.140 --> 05:44.509
I can't tell you how I know
this, butI know this.

05:44.540 --> 05:47.134
Redmayne's in touch with Prady.
How do you know this?

05:47.180 --> 05:48.932
I just said I can't tell you.
Do you know this

05:48.980 --> 05:50.800
or do you suspect it?
I know this.

05:52.050 --> 05:53.915
We're screwed.

05:53.950 --> 05:56.009
I'll get cookies.
Jerome Morris.

05:56.050 --> 05:59.918
(English accent):
Actor, raconteur, teacher...

05:59.960 --> 06:01.848
And you played Bernard Loomis
in Call It Murder?

06:01.890 --> 06:04.051
I did. I like the small screen.

06:04.090 --> 06:07.651
There's, uh,
so many more challenges.

06:07.700 --> 06:10.567
(quietly):
Oh, my. He is a cartoon.

06:10.600 --> 06:12.568
CARY: What have you done
prior to this?
Is that it, the casting tape?

06:12.600 --> 06:14.534
. _ Yes. _
You re a lifesaver, Kalinda.

06:14.570 --> 06:16.709
(phone buzzing)
MORRIS: Uh, I stood by

06:16.740 --> 06:18.537
for several roles...

06:18.570 --> 06:21.539
Hello?

06:21.580 --> 06:23.548
Mr. Bishop?

06:23.580 --> 06:25.707
Why does it take you eight rings
to answer?

06:25.750 --> 06:27.445
Uh, I was in court, sir.

06:27.480 --> 06:28.777
Uh, do you need something?

06:28.820 --> 06:30.447
I do. The favor.

06:30.490 --> 06:32.014
The one you owe me.

06:32.050 --> 06:33.984
Yeah, uh, look,
if this has anything to do

06:34.020 --> 06:36.159
with Florrick-Agos,
we could always just bill it

06:36.190 --> 06:39.694
through the firm.
No. It doesn't.

06:39.730 --> 06:41.527
What is it, sir?

06:41.560 --> 06:42.925
CARY:
And in inhabiting

06:42.970 --> 06:45.859
Mr. Loomis,
were you ever directed

06:45.900 --> 06:47.458
to base your part
on Mr. Sweeney?

06:47.500 --> 06:50.469
No, I base my performance
on life.

06:50.510 --> 06:54.207
Uh, I build a performance
from here.

06:54.240 --> 06:56.970
Uh, let the record reflect I was

06:57.010 --> 06:58.773
pointing to my ear.
JUDGE:
Actually, uh,

06:58.810 --> 07:00.016
Mr. Morris, that's my job.

07:00.050 --> 07:01.847
My apologies, Your Honor.

07:01.880 --> 07:03.689
Uh, I did Inherit the Wind.

07:03.720 --> 07:04.948
Would you admit
that you bear

07:04.990 --> 07:06.981
a striking resemblance
to Mr. Sweeney?

07:07.020 --> 07:09.557
(scoffs)
He's, what, ten years my senior?

07:09.590 --> 07:11.854
We share
a certain...

07:11.890 --> 07:13.448
je ne sais quoi...
And don't you think

07:13.500 --> 07:15.456
that similarity suggests exactly
to the audience

07:15.500 --> 07:17.468
who you're portraying?
No, I created

07:17.500 --> 07:19.991
an entirely original character.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.837
But your inflections
in this episode

07:21.870 --> 07:24.031
are identical to Mr. Sweeney.
I mean...

07:24.070 --> 07:26.538
it was masterful,
the way that you copied him.

07:26.580 --> 07:28.502
Well...
Objection.
Your Honor,

07:28.540 --> 07:31.543
uh, counsel is attempting to
trick the witness with flattery.

07:31.580 --> 07:33.218
I was just complimenting
a performance.
Sustained.

07:33.250 --> 07:35.468
Ask the same thing
without the compliment.
Mr. Morris,

07:35.520 --> 07:37.841
were you ever directed to play
the part like Mr. Sweeney?
No.

07:37.890 --> 07:38.845
Neven

07:38.890 --> 07:39.982
I am nothing like him.

07:40.020 --> 07:42.159
He's like my retarded brother.
Shh.

07:42.190 --> 07:44.556
Let me play you a tape,
Mr. Morris.

07:44.590 --> 07:47.024
Y-You want it more serious?

07:47.060 --> 07:49.528
TIERNEY:
No, but do you know
Colin Sweeney?

07:49.570 --> 07:53.062
Do it like Colin Sweeney.
CARY: Would you like to revise
your testimony, Mr. Morris?

07:53.100 --> 07:54.590
What do you mean?
You just said
you were never directed

07:54.640 --> 07:56.608
to base your performance
on Colin Sweeney.

07:56.640 --> 07:58.164
Wasn't that the producer
doing exactly that?

07:58.210 --> 07:59.768
That was
an audition.

07:59.810 --> 08:02.677
Nothing is very serious
at an audition.

08:02.710 --> 08:04.678
Nothing further.
Mr. Morris,

08:04.710 --> 08:07.508
were you directed to base your
performance on anyone else?

08:07.550 --> 08:08.744
What do you mean?
Like...

08:08.780 --> 08:09.781
Claus von Bulow...
Objection,

08:09.820 --> 08:11.913
Your Honor. Leading.
Sustained.

08:11.950 --> 08:14.282
I'm sorry, Your Honor. I was
just trying to save some time.

08:14.320 --> 08:16.288
Were you directed
to base your performance

08:16.320 --> 08:19.528
on any other accused killers?

08:19.560 --> 08:21.994
Yes, I was. That one.

08:22.030 --> 08:23.520
Claus Vonbulow,

08:23.570 --> 08:25.026
for...

08:25.070 --> 08:27.038
for
example.
Huh.

08:27.070 --> 08:28.264
MARISSA:
You have to be

08:28.300 --> 08:30.006
at the Shriners
in one hour.

08:30.040 --> 08:32.702
I just need
to pick up a few things...

08:33.840 --> 08:35.637
You're not
answering my texts.

08:35.680 --> 08:37.978
I'm a bit busy, Mr. Sweeney.

08:38.010 --> 08:39.648
I told you, she's campaigning.

08:39.680 --> 08:42.069
She doesn't have time.

08:42.120 --> 08:45.647
I'm unhappy.
Does it matter to you

08:45.690 --> 08:48.181
that I'm unhappy?
Does it matter to me
that you're unhappy?

08:48.220 --> 08:52.623
Um, not so much.
You prepped
for this trial, Alicia.

08:52.660 --> 08:56.198
Ten months ago, you swore to me
that you could win this.
No,

08:56.230 --> 08:57.788
I didn't.
Yes,
when you wanted me

08:57.830 --> 08:59.195
to stay on as a client.
No.

08:59.230 --> 09:01.061
In fact,
I told you to drop it,

09:01.100 --> 09:02.965
that defamation
was hard to win,

09:03.010 --> 09:05.035
but that if you wanted to
pursue it, we would do our best,

09:05.070 --> 09:08.073
and we did. And we are.

09:08.110 --> 09:10.908
No, you said you
would do your best.

09:10.950 --> 09:12.201
And you...

09:12.250 --> 09:14.275
are not. Hello.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.618
Hi. Marissa. I'm the body woman.

09:16.650 --> 09:17.947
Really?

09:17.990 --> 09:20.083
The whole body? Or just parts?
Marissa,

09:20.120 --> 09:22.111
why don't you wait outside.
Just ignore him.
He likes

09:22.160 --> 09:23.980
unsettling people.

09:24.030 --> 09:26.123
Hi. I'm Renata.
Don't worry.

09:26.160 --> 09:28.048
I don't unsettle easily.
Oh, don't

09:28.100 --> 09:29.795
tell him that. It's a challenge.

09:29.830 --> 09:31.263
Here, sit.
We take your business
seriously,

09:31.300 --> 09:33.632
Mr. Sweeney.
We have two name partners

09:33.670 --> 09:35.137
fighting for you in court.
Yes,

09:35.170 --> 09:38.003
but Diane and Cary
don't like me.

09:38.040 --> 09:39.302
I don't like you either.

09:39.340 --> 09:40.739
Don't be silly.

09:40.780 --> 09:42.748
This TV show
makes me out

09:42.780 --> 09:47.274
to be a killer. Herald
Equity's stock has plunged 56%,

09:47.320 --> 09:50.141
and the board will fire me
ifI can't clear my name.

09:50.190 --> 09:52.385
Israel. I was in the IDF.

09:52.420 --> 09:55.150
Oh. The army.
Yeah.
Two years.

09:55.190 --> 09:57.021
Lone soldier.
So you carried

09:57.060 --> 09:59.028
a gun. What kind?

09:59.060 --> 10:01.255
TAR-21. Assault rifle.
Oh, my God.

10:01.300 --> 10:03.188
Did you kill anyone?
No.

10:03.230 --> 10:06.119
Oh. But you wanted to.
I wanted action.

10:06.170 --> 10:09.094
Just so I could write about it.
A frustrated novelist.

10:09.140 --> 10:11.665
Me, too.
SWEENEY:
I will leave here.

10:11.710 --> 10:13.701
I will leave your firm.

10:13.740 --> 10:15.139
Go ahead, Mr. Sweeney.
I don't care.

10:15.180 --> 10:16.841
You're heartless.

10:16.880 --> 10:18.347
No, I just know
that you won't.

10:18.380 --> 10:20.109
I know when you're bluffing.

10:20.150 --> 10:22.118
Okay. Try this bluff.

10:22.150 --> 10:24.710
I know who finances your PAC.

10:24.750 --> 10:27.116
Oh...

10:27.160 --> 10:29.219
that brought you up short.

10:29.260 --> 10:30.989
How would that sound,

10:31.030 --> 10:34.193
me telling the press
who's laundering his money

10:34.230 --> 10:36.721
through your PAC?

10:37.770 --> 10:40.193
Okay, Mr. Sweeney.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.959
I will consult
with Diane and Cary.

10:43.010 --> 10:44.307
I will look
through the evidence.

10:44.340 --> 10:46.137
But I won't be in court.

10:46.170 --> 10:48.707
I won't be seen with you.

10:48.740 --> 10:50.708
That's the best
I can offer,

10:50.750 --> 10:52.206
and if you don't want
to take it,

10:52.250 --> 10:54.218
go ahead, go to the press.

10:54.250 --> 10:56.241
Come on, Marissa.

10:56.280 --> 10:58.714
(siren wailing in distance)

10:59.720 --> 11:01.381
You're late.

11:01.420 --> 11:03.285
Tell Marcus:

11:03.330 --> 11:05.787
wait on the delivery.

11:07.430 --> 11:09.159
(car door closes)

11:09.200 --> 11:11.919
I need you at this address
at 3:00 tomorrow.

11:11.970 --> 11:13.892
And every day this week
and next week.

11:13.940 --> 11:15.339
You'll be picking someone up.

11:15.370 --> 11:16.462
Look”.

11:16.500 --> 11:18.331
I'm not really a bodyguard, sir,

11:18.370 --> 11:20.235
but I can hire somebody...
No.

11:20.280 --> 11:23.169
I need someone who
doesn't look like a bodyguard.

11:23.210 --> 11:24.848
Why?

11:24.880 --> 11:26.973
Dylan's school doesn't like

11:27.020 --> 11:28.976
people who look like bodyguards.

11:29.020 --> 11:30.817
This is for Dylan?

11:30.850 --> 11:32.283
Yes. That's the address
of his school.

11:32.320 --> 11:34.959
I need you to pick him up
and drive him home

11:34.990 --> 11:37.424
after school every day
for the next two weeks.

11:39.530 --> 11:42.829
I don't mean to offend you,
sir, but I'm...
Then don't.

11:42.870 --> 11:45.395
My son means
everything to me.

11:45.430 --> 11:48.831
I am trusting you with the most
valuable thing in my life.

11:48.870 --> 11:50.201
You understand?

11:53.010 --> 11:54.409
JUDGE:
What is this?

11:54.440 --> 11:56.806
The original
casting breakdown.
I don't know

11:56.850 --> 11:59.000
what that is.
It's a breakdown
of the characters,

11:59.050 --> 12:00.369
sent out to agents
to get casting.

12:00.420 --> 12:01.944
Where did you get that?
As you can see,

12:01.980 --> 12:03.845
Your Honor, these are
the original names

12:03.890 --> 12:05.346
of the characters,
before the studio's
legal department

12:05.390 --> 12:07.312
advised the production
to change them.
Your Honor,

12:07.360 --> 12:09.214
clearly the plaintiff
has been diving

12:09.260 --> 12:11.353
into Dumpsters
for this proprietary
information.

12:11.390 --> 12:12.891
But why is this bad,
Counselors?

12:12.930 --> 12:14.955
Instruct me.
The name

12:15.000 --> 12:16.251
of the murdered wife
is Carolyn.

12:16.300 --> 12:18.962
The name_ of the murderer
is Colin.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.433
The name of the detective
is Rick Crowell.

12:20.470 --> 12:21.960
These are all
the names

12:22.000 --> 12:23.968
of the real people
in the Colin Sweeney case.

12:24.010 --> 12:25.034
KRAUSE:
I am...

12:25.070 --> 12:26.037
outraged, Your Honor.

12:26.070 --> 12:27.105
Well, you're welcome

12:27.140 --> 12:28.368
to your outrage,
Ms. Krause,

12:28.410 --> 12:31.243
but I am inclined to
decide that the plaintiff

12:31.280 --> 12:32.872
has proved likeness.

12:32.920 --> 12:35.309
I believe that this episode,
though fictionalized,

12:35.350 --> 12:37.284
does defame Mr. Sweeney.

12:37.320 --> 12:39.140
Unless you have
something else.

12:39.190 --> 12:40.350
KRAUSE:
I do.

12:40.390 --> 12:41.516
Your Honor,

12:41.560 --> 12:43.528
I do_ have
something more.

12:43.560 --> 12:45.289
The episode

12:45.330 --> 12:47.389
does not defame Colin Sweeney

12:47.430 --> 12:49.557
because it is, in fact, true.

12:49.600 --> 12:51.420
Colin Sweeney
killed his wife.

12:51.470 --> 12:53.290
DIANE:
Your Honor, this is crazy.
CARY: Are you kidding me?

12:53.340 --> 12:54.932
KRAUSE: The episode
depicts something

12:54.970 --> 12:56.392
that actually happened.
CARY: Colin Sweeney

12:56.440 --> 12:59.000
was found not guilty
by a jury of his peers.
Yes,

12:59.040 --> 13:02.134
but the threshold for truth
is higher in a criminal court.

13:02.180 --> 13:05.343
You ready to prove
Colin Sweeney murdered his wife?

13:05.380 --> 13:06.347
Yes, Your Honor.

13:06.380 --> 13:08.371
Well, I won't stop you.

13:08.420 --> 13:11.184
We'll meet this afternoon
to hear the defense's case.

13:11.220 --> 13:13.211
(gavelbangs)

13:26.530 --> 13:28.862
Okay, Guy Redmayne,
born Dallas 1942.

13:28.900 --> 13:30.162
The oldest of
three siblings.

13:30.210 --> 13:31.359
Made his fortune
in real estate.

13:31.410 --> 13:33.105
Pro-Israel.
JOSH:
He's the player

13:33.140 --> 13:34.539
in Democratic circles.

13:34.580 --> 13:38.004
The PAC he runs helped 72
Democrats get elected last year.

13:38.050 --> 13:40.348
Who's that, his wife?
No, that's his daughter,
Crystal.

13:40.380 --> 13:41.938
You'll meet her
at the club, too.

13:41.980 --> 13:43.948
What time?
4:00. And he‘s
squeezmg us in,

13:43.990 --> 13:45.343
so you'll have
to move fast.
Which means

13:45.390 --> 13:49.087
you need to learn how to ask
for things. Let's hear it.

13:49.120 --> 13:51.918
What, now?
JOSH: Yeah, why?
Come on.

13:51.960 --> 13:53.257
Ask me for money.

13:55.100 --> 13:56.192
My name's
Alicia Florrick.

13:56.230 --> 13:57.390
Thank you
for meeting me.

13:57.430 --> 13:59.967
I hope you'll consider...
No. No qualifiers.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.558
You don't hope that
someone will consider.

14:01.600 --> 14:03.033
I'd like your...
JOSH: No.

14:03.070 --> 14:04.606
(groans)
Own it.

14:04.640 --> 14:06.335
I want your support.

14:06.370 --> 14:08.099
I believe together
we can influence...

14:08.140 --> 14:09.300
Not influence--
accomplish.

14:09.340 --> 14:11.001
You're a doer, so do.

14:11.050 --> 14:12.176
Give me your money. Now.

14:12.210 --> 14:13.438
That's closer,
but it's not funny.

14:13.480 --> 14:14.344
Think of how
Bill Clinton does it.

14:14.380 --> 14:16.143
Do you want to be a
part of my movement?

14:16.180 --> 14:17.147
Then give. You'll
be joining something

14:17.190 --> 14:18.145
bigger than yourself;

14:18.190 --> 14:19.145
you'll be helping the world.

14:19.190 --> 14:20.157
It's to their benefit,

14:20.190 --> 14:21.157
not to yours.

14:21.190 --> 14:22.589
The money's weighing them down,

14:22.620 --> 14:24.884
so relieve them of it.

14:24.930 --> 14:27.353
(orchestral classical music
playing loudly)

14:29.230 --> 14:31.323
*

14:33.470 --> 14:34.596
Oh!

14:34.640 --> 14:36.369
(quietly):
This is ghastly.

14:36.400 --> 14:38.368
Mr. Sweeney, shh.

14:38.410 --> 14:40.298
(on video):
Yes, 911.

14:40.340 --> 14:42.376
Hello. My name is

14:42.410 --> 14:44.298
Bernard Loomis...

14:44.350 --> 14:48.673
and I think something
has happened to my wife...

14:48.720 --> 14:50.381
Oops.

14:50.420 --> 14:52.081
One second.

14:52.120 --> 14:54.088
Uh, I'll call you back.

14:54.120 --> 14:55.917
*

14:55.960 --> 14:57.222
(choir singing)

14:57.260 --> 15:00.297
*
(strained grunting)

15:02.260 --> 15:03.966
(thunder crashes)

15:04.000 --> 15:05.262
KRAUSE:
Detective Crowell,

15:05.300 --> 15:07.291
how accurate would you
say that sequence is?

15:07.340 --> 15:10.059
I worked the case,
and I'm a technical advisor

15:10.110 --> 15:12.305
on the show-- that's
exactly how Mr. Sweeney

15:12.340 --> 15:14.399
covered up the murder.
There was a rug missing

15:14.440 --> 15:16.977
from Mr. Sweeney's house,
Mr. Sweeney had a receipt

15:17.010 --> 15:19.604
for a gallon jug of lye
in his work-shed.

15:19.650 --> 15:23.086
His lawyer convinced the judge
the warrants didn't cover

15:23.120 --> 15:25.247
"detached dwellings."
Detective,
did the actual

15:25.290 --> 15:29.283
Colin Sweeney make a 911 call
when he buried his wife?

15:29.320 --> 15:30.719
Uh...
I'm sorry--
when he discovered

15:30.760 --> 15:32.421
his wife was missing?
Yes, he did.

15:32.460 --> 15:34.496
I'd like to play
it for the court.

15:34.530 --> 15:36.623
(recording): Yes, 911.
SWEENEY (quietly):
Uh-oh.

15:36.660 --> 15:39.424
Hello. My name is Colin Sweeney,
(loud classical music playing)

15:39.470 --> 15:43.429
and I think something
has happened to my wife.

15:43.470 --> 15:45.006
Oops. Uh...

15:45.040 --> 15:48.100
one second. Uh...

15:48.140 --> 15:51.348
I'll call you back.
KRAUSE: My goodness. That's
very similar to the 911 call

15:51.380 --> 15:52.404
on the show.

15:52.450 --> 15:53.678
Yes, identical.
Nothing further.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.176
ALICIA:
Detective, how many times

15:55.220 --> 15:57.688
have you testified
against Mr. Sweeney?

15:57.720 --> 15:59.347
Four times.
This is my fourth.
And each time

15:59.390 --> 16:02.109
you've lost-- Sweeney
was cleared of all charges?

16:02.160 --> 16:04.253
We call him the luckiest
murderer on the planet.
I see.

16:04.290 --> 16:07.259
And given this attitude,
don't you have an ax to grind?

16:07.300 --> 16:09.256
No.
In fact,

16:09.300 --> 16:11.427
haven't you admitted...
KRAUSE:
Sidebar, Your Honor.

16:11.470 --> 16:12.664
JUDGE:
Let's go. Come on up.

16:12.700 --> 16:14.395
What's eating you, Ms. Krause?

16:14.440 --> 16:15.566
Your Honor,
plaintiff's counsel

16:15.600 --> 16:18.535
is preparing
to introduce e-mails...

16:18.570 --> 16:20.504
(Diane and Cary speaking)
e-mails in which
Detective Crowell

16:20.540 --> 16:23.100
insists that
he will, quote,

16:23.150 --> 16:25.471
"get Sweeney eventually,"
unquote, but their investigator

16:25.510 --> 16:27.341
hacked into the
detective's account

16:27.380 --> 16:29.575
and obtained the
e-mails illegally.

16:29.620 --> 16:30.746
JUDGE:
Counselors,

16:30.790 --> 16:32.143
is this true?

16:33.720 --> 16:35.517
Damn it. How did
she find out?

16:35.560 --> 16:39.155
David Lee.
No, he wouldn't do
that. Would he?

16:39.190 --> 16:42.455
Kalinda, who else knew
about these Crowell e-mails?

16:42.500 --> 16:45.094
The judge is rejecting them
as illegally obtained.

16:45.130 --> 16:46.597
Only you and Cary.

16:46.630 --> 16:49.758
Look, I'll look into it
as soon as I get back, okay?

16:49.800 --> 16:51.506
Bye.

16:51.540 --> 16:55.431
It's illegal to drive
and talk on the phone.

16:55.480 --> 16:57.607
It's a $75 fine.

16:57.650 --> 17:01.472
But it's more
with a child in the car.

17:01.520 --> 17:05.388
Should we just try silence
for a moment, Dylan? Hmm?

17:14.230 --> 17:16.221
Where are you going?

17:16.260 --> 17:18.694
A different way.

17:21.440 --> 17:24.705
This is the way
to Brian's house.

17:24.740 --> 17:27.504
He was my best friend,
uh, but he moved.

17:27.540 --> 17:29.076
He moved
to Las Vegas.

17:29.110 --> 17:30.372
He's the only one

17:30.410 --> 17:32.799
whose parents let him
come over to my house.

17:32.850 --> 17:35.273
Dylan, I need you

17:35.320 --> 17:36.412
to do me a favor.

17:36.450 --> 17:39.283
Scoot down in your seat.

17:39.320 --> 17:41.413
Why?
Just do it.

17:51.170 --> 17:52.865
This is RL-567.

17:52.900 --> 17:55.289
I need to check
a license

17:55.340 --> 17:58.366
on an Illinois
plate: RFIS6TH.

17:58.410 --> 18:00.298
I'll hold.

18:04.850 --> 18:08.479
All American Mike says
that my dad killed my mom.

18:11.490 --> 18:12.809
What?

18:12.850 --> 18:14.488
He's a kid at my school.

18:14.520 --> 18:16.408
All American Mike,
he, uh...

18:16.460 --> 18:19.179
he says my dad killed my mom.

18:20.260 --> 18:21.852
Well, why would
he say that?

18:21.900 --> 18:23.367
I don't know.

18:23.400 --> 18:26.119
He said it was true.

18:26.170 --> 18:28.468
SWEENEY:
Someone is leaking

18:28.500 --> 18:30.639
to the defense.
I don't like
being undercut

18:30.670 --> 18:33.503
by my own firm.
Yeah. That's too bad.

18:33.540 --> 18:35.599
Do you trust Cary Agos?

18:36.540 --> 18:38.474
What?
Cary Agos.

18:38.510 --> 18:39.579
Is he leaking?

18:39.610 --> 18:41.475
No.
Who, then?

18:41.520 --> 18:43.818
(sighs)

18:43.850 --> 18:45.818
ALICIA:
If you lose your seat

18:45.850 --> 18:47.556
on the board, does your wife

18:47.590 --> 18:49.717
get to keep hers?
SWEENEY: Renata?

18:49.760 --> 18:51.557
I guess.

18:51.590 --> 18:53.558
What are you saying?
You've been married going on...?

18:53.600 --> 18:55.295
Eight months. Why?

18:58.300 --> 19:00.598
Do your homework.
I'll be right up.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.403
No video games.

19:03.440 --> 19:05.260
Bye, Kalinda.

19:07.340 --> 19:08.534
(quietly):
You got a plate?

19:08.580 --> 19:10.901
A Jesse Raymond White,
of Darien.

19:10.950 --> 19:14.249
No priors.
Is that anyone you know?

19:14.280 --> 19:16.441
That might not mean anything.

19:16.480 --> 19:18.914
Keep track if it's
the same car tomorrow.

19:19.950 --> 19:22.487
What did
Dylan say?

19:22.520 --> 19:25.182
About the SUV? Nothing.

19:25.230 --> 19:26.788
No. About... anything.

19:26.830 --> 19:29.799
He said I shouldn't be
on my cell when I drive.

19:29.830 --> 19:31.764
(chuckles softly)

19:31.800 --> 19:33.665
Nothing else?

19:33.700 --> 19:35.759
Not really.
He didn't say
anything about

19:35.800 --> 19:36.835
the kids at school?

19:36.870 --> 19:38.462
Yeah. Someone named Brian,

19:38.510 --> 19:39.636
who moved away.

19:39.670 --> 19:42.673
Did he say anything
about Mike Zeiler?

19:42.710 --> 19:44.678
All American Mike?

19:45.710 --> 19:46.745
Yes.

19:46.780 --> 19:48.771
What did he say?

19:48.820 --> 19:51.539
He just mentioned him.

19:52.550 --> 19:54.689
Part of your job, Kalinda--

19:54.720 --> 19:56.210
a big part--

19:56.260 --> 19:58.524
is to tell me
what Dylan says.

19:58.560 --> 20:00.289
You understand?

20:00.330 --> 20:01.695
I'm not really

20:01.730 --> 20:02.856
a kid person, sir.

20:02.900 --> 20:04.788
But maybe there is someone...
No, no, no,

20:04.830 --> 20:05.967
there's nobody.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.433
There's you.

20:13.010 --> 20:14.875
MAN:
Mrs. Florrick.

20:14.910 --> 20:17.777
Guy Redmayne.

20:17.810 --> 20:21.541
My daughter and, uh,
aide-de-camp, Crystal.

20:21.580 --> 20:23.343
Alicia Florrick.
Thank you both so much

20:23.390 --> 20:25.688
for meeting me. I...
Sit. Sit.

20:26.690 --> 20:27.850
(groans)

20:27.890 --> 20:30.017
Double vodka. Oh, do
you want a pick-me-up,

20:30.060 --> 20:32.688
Mrs. Florrick?
Oh, no, thank you.
And it's Alicia.

20:32.730 --> 20:34.254
Okay, Alicia.

20:34.300 --> 20:35.722
Yeah.

20:35.760 --> 20:37.660
Now, I only have
a few moments.

20:37.700 --> 20:39.827
Let's cut to
the chase.

20:39.870 --> 20:41.565
You want my money, huh?

20:41.600 --> 20:42.737
(laughs)
Yes.

20:42.770 --> 20:45.330
Ah?
And let me tell you
why I deserve it.

20:45.370 --> 20:46.598
Yeah?
I will reduce

20:46.640 --> 20:47.470
the murder rate

20:47.510 --> 20:50.001
by aggressively prosecuting
gun crimes.

20:50.040 --> 20:52.804
Good. It's a
big problem.

20:52.850 --> 20:54.511
And...

20:54.550 --> 20:56.677
because I also believe
in the swift administration

20:56.720 --> 20:58.585
of justice...
Mm-hmm?

20:58.620 --> 21:00.508
I will make it a priority

21:00.560 --> 21:03.586
to double the speed
of our prosecutions.
Yeah, well...

21:03.630 --> 21:05.427
you're good on substance,

21:05.460 --> 21:07.826
but family values--

21:07.860 --> 21:09.919
it's critical
to a guy like me.

21:09.960 --> 21:11.723
How long have you
been married?

21:11.770 --> 21:13.738
Oh, um, 21 years.

21:13.770 --> 21:16.489
Ah, 38 for me.
You know,

21:16.540 --> 21:18.701
till Sylvia died
of ovarian cancer.

21:18.740 --> 21:19.900
I'm so sorry.

21:19.940 --> 21:21.635
We went through
a lot,

21:21.680 --> 21:22.931
but we stayed together.

21:22.980 --> 21:25.540
Like you and
your husband.

21:25.580 --> 21:27.969
It speaks volumes.

21:28.020 --> 21:30.648
So do you, um...

21:30.690 --> 21:32.988
always demand
this kind of privacy?

21:33.020 --> 21:35.784
Everywhere I go.
I hate people.

21:35.820 --> 21:38.789
I love mankind,
but I hate people.

21:38.830 --> 21:40.957
Especially when they eat.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.797
Now, why don't you sit
back down, Alicia.

21:42.830 --> 21:44.695
Let me see those
pretty legs of yours.

21:44.730 --> 21:47.392
(laughs softly)

21:47.440 --> 21:50.364
You are, uh,
pretty fresh, aren't you?

21:50.410 --> 21:51.638
It's my best feature.

21:51.670 --> 21:54.537
I got the testicles
of a 20-year-old.

21:54.580 --> 21:56.730
Where? In your briefcase?

21:57.810 --> 21:59.801
(laughing)

21:59.850 --> 22:01.408
You!

22:01.450 --> 22:03.441
Isn't she
great, Crystal?
So, um...

22:03.490 --> 22:05.685
What do you think of my stance?

22:05.720 --> 22:07.881
Well, I'm going to
support you, Alicia.

22:07.920 --> 22:11.083
Yeah. One million in
dark money. Thank you.

22:12.890 --> 22:14.721
Thank you, Mr. Redmayne.

22:14.760 --> 22:17.593
It's not because of your pretty
face or because you have

22:17.630 --> 22:19.769
the best eyes on a
lawyer I've ever seen.

22:19.800 --> 22:21.438
Well, then, why is it?

22:21.470 --> 22:23.358
'Cause I don't like fags.

22:24.740 --> 22:26.503
I heard the calls
your campaign

22:26.540 --> 22:27.939
is making to
the suburbs.

22:27.980 --> 22:29.800
It's a smart way to use it.

22:29.840 --> 22:31.808
Um, well, actually,
that-that's not us.

22:31.850 --> 22:34.774
That's our PAC. And I'm not
even sure if it is our PAC...

22:34.820 --> 22:36.811
You hear about the
two fags on safari?

22:36.850 --> 22:38.841
No, um, and just so you know,
It's...

22:38.890 --> 22:41.757
Mr. Redmayne's married.
I... Mr. Prady's married.

22:41.790 --> 22:44.486
Yeah?
Or he... he was married.

22:44.530 --> 22:46.088
It's good meeting you, honey.

22:46.130 --> 22:48.121
Keep up the good work.

22:48.160 --> 22:50.128
Kick that fruitcake
when he's down.

22:50.160 --> 22:53.368
I love people who
share my values.

22:59.710 --> 23:00.836
Welcome back, everyone.
Ms. Krause, you may call

23:00.880 --> 23:04.805
your next
witness.
Defense calls Renata

23:04.850 --> 23:07.148
Ellard-Sweeney.
Your Honor, the witness is

23:07.180 --> 23:09.978
the plaintiff's wife. We move
to exclude her on the basis

23:10.020 --> 23:11.817
of marital _ _
communications prIVIlege.
Which covers

23:11.850 --> 23:14.978
only communications
made between spouses

23:15.020 --> 23:16.612
during marriage.

23:16.660 --> 23:18.127
Hey. Hey, uh...

23:18.160 --> 23:19.650
d-darling.

23:22.500 --> 23:25.128
Oh, dear.

23:25.170 --> 23:27.161
I think she's mad at me.

23:30.710 --> 23:33.099
(thunder crashes)

23:44.590 --> 23:46.148
KRAUSE:
Did your husband tell you

23:46.190 --> 23:48.715
that he buried the gloves he
wore when he murdered Carolyn?

23:48.760 --> 23:50.648
Objection. Marital privilege.
Did he
tell you before

23:50.690 --> 23:52.123
you were married?
Yes.
Overruled.

23:52.160 --> 23:54.651
We had gone away
for the weekend to Calistoga.

23:54.700 --> 23:57.999
We were having sex
in a supply closet.

23:58.030 --> 23:59.725
I told him he was bad,

23:59.770 --> 24:01.692
he said I didn't know
how bad. so...

24:01.740 --> 24:03.196
I asked him to tell me.

24:03.240 --> 24:04.662
Did you have occasion
to tell Detective Crowell

24:04.710 --> 24:06.007
about these gloves?
Yes,

24:06.040 --> 24:07.735
that's how they
got in the episode.

24:07.780 --> 24:09.771
Guess I should
move those gloves.

24:12.950 --> 24:15.817
I don't understand
what the problem is.

24:15.850 --> 24:17.647
The problem is
you need to tell us

24:17.690 --> 24:19.043
you were joking,
Mr. Sweeney.

24:19.090 --> 24:20.910
Why?
Because if... (sighs)

24:20.960 --> 24:22.916
if we know you killed
Carolyn, we can't

24:22.960 --> 24:24.689
elicit testimony from
you that you didn't.

24:24.730 --> 24:26.652
Which means that your
wife's accusations

24:26.690 --> 24:29.158
go unchallenged.
So were you joking,
Mr. Sweeney?

24:32.270 --> 24:34.761
Yes, of course I was joking.

24:34.800 --> 24:37.906
But I do need to talk to Alicia
about something.

24:39.140 --> 24:40.801
Your colleagues

24:40.840 --> 24:42.637
worry that I might
perjure myself

24:42.680 --> 24:44.807
on the stand.
Regarding what?

24:44.850 --> 24:46.909
Whether I murdered
dear Carolyn.

24:46.950 --> 24:49.077
Now, speaking
hypothetically,

24:49.120 --> 24:50.678
if I did
perjure myself,

24:50.720 --> 24:52.847
could I be prosecuted?
Mr. Sweeney,

24:52.890 --> 24:54.517
why can't you be having
this discussion

24:54.560 --> 24:56.050
with Cary or Diane?
Because

24:56.090 --> 24:58.888
your ethical compunctions
are much more pronounced,

24:58.930 --> 25:01.558
which means I'll get
a more considered answer.

25:01.600 --> 25:03.898
One more likely
to keep me out of trouble.

25:03.930 --> 25:06.899
Perjury prosecutions
in civil cases

25:06.930 --> 25:08.591
are exceedingly rare.

25:08.640 --> 25:10.733
Good.
But given your profile,

25:10.770 --> 25:13.603
I think the SA. would jump
at the chance to nail you.

25:13.640 --> 25:16.200
So you need
to give yourself cover.
What, uh...

25:16.240 --> 25:17.798
Show me.

25:17.850 --> 25:20.569
Mr. Sweeney,
did you kill your wife?

25:20.620 --> 25:21.746
Absolutely not.

25:21.780 --> 25:23.543
No. Try this.
As I've said

25:23.590 --> 25:25.740
on numerous occasions,
I did not kill my wife.

25:25.790 --> 25:29.180
Ah, tricky, triclq,
yes, yes. Go on.

25:29.220 --> 25:30.778
Sometimes
you can't Sidestep,

25:30.830 --> 25:32.183
so you evade
completely.

25:32.230 --> 25:33.891
Did you take drugs

25:33.930 --> 25:35.852
the day Carolyn disappeared?

25:35.900 --> 25:38.164
A sleeping pill.
_ Which can
impact memory.

25:38.200 --> 25:39.895
So if you don't
want to answer,

25:39.930 --> 25:42.831
say you were under the influence
of prescription medication.

25:42.870 --> 25:45.839
And I can't recall anything
that happened that day.

25:45.870 --> 25:47.633
Yes.

25:47.680 --> 25:50.569
Mrs. Florrick,

25:50.610 --> 25:52.578
whatever will I do without you?

25:52.610 --> 25:53.918
(school bell rings)

26:11.900 --> 26:14.266
Whoa, hold up, hold up.
Hey!
What are you gonna do,
you little baby?

26:14.300 --> 26:15.995
Hey.

26:16.040 --> 26:17.905
Lower your fist
or I'm gonna break your arm.

26:19.910 --> 26:20.877
We were just...

26:20.910 --> 26:22.707
We're friends, right, Dylan?

26:24.010 --> 26:25.307
You touch him again,

26:25.350 --> 26:27.170
and I'll be back.

26:27.210 --> 26:29.917
Now... tell me you understand.

26:29.950 --> 26:31.941
I understand.

26:53.980 --> 26:55.675
Don't tell my dad.

26:55.710 --> 26:57.678
What?

26:57.710 --> 26:59.769
I said don't tell my dad.

26:59.810 --> 27:01.072
About that kid?

27:01.120 --> 27:02.940
All American Mike.
Don't tell him.

27:02.980 --> 27:04.845
He'll just get angry.

27:04.890 --> 27:07.859
You'll have a black eye.
I got it from tripping
after school.

27:08.990 --> 27:10.958
Please. He'll do something.

27:10.990 --> 27:12.127
He'll scare them.

27:14.330 --> 27:16.992
Dylan, I'm gonna go

27:17.030 --> 27:18.668
a little bit faster here, okay?

27:18.700 --> 27:20.668
But don't worry, I...
I know what I'm doing.

27:20.700 --> 27:22.691
I'm fine.

27:22.740 --> 27:24.207
Do you promise?

27:27.210 --> 27:28.871
Where's your dad?

27:28.910 --> 27:30.332
I don't know.

27:30.380 --> 27:32.268
BISHOP:
What do you want me to do?

27:32.310 --> 27:35.074
That's not what we talked about.
Uh, Dylan is home, sir.

27:35.120 --> 27:37.839
All right, thank you.

27:37.890 --> 27:39.881
What?

27:39.920 --> 27:43.412
I was very clear about
how I wanted this to go
down and what I wanted.

27:43.460 --> 27:45.348
You're not listening to me.
KRAUSE: Call It Murder

27:45.390 --> 27:47.324
depicts your character
as engaged

27:47.360 --> 27:49.123
in a sexual practice called

27:49.160 --> 27:50.866
breath play, right?

27:50.900 --> 27:52.060
That's correct.
And did you engage

27:52.100 --> 27:54.330
in this practice
with your late wife?

27:54.370 --> 27:56.167
Not as often
as I would've liked.
So you

27:56.200 --> 27:58.031
would have
liked to strangle

27:58.070 --> 27:59.162
Carolyn more?

27:59.210 --> 28:00.939
What a crass way to put it.

28:00.980 --> 28:03.278
I meant I miss my wife.

28:03.310 --> 28:05.904
Okay. As depicted in the show,

28:05.950 --> 28:08.976
you're also
a practitioner of shibari,

28:09.020 --> 28:10.442
S and M
and piquerism,

28:10.480 --> 28:12.016
all of which
you engaged in

28:12.050 --> 28:13.347
with other partners.
Uh,

28:13.390 --> 28:15.187
what's piquerism?
Deriving

28:15.220 --> 28:17.108
sexual satisfaction by stabbing

28:17.160 --> 28:19.355
or cutting your partner.
Objection, this

28:19.390 --> 28:20.948
questioning is irrelevant
as to whether Mr. Sweeney

28:21.000 --> 28:22.251
killed his wife.
It's not

28:22.300 --> 28:23.790
about whether
he killed his wife.

28:23.830 --> 28:25.058
It's whether the overall
portrayal

28:25.100 --> 28:26.920
of Mr. Sweeney is accurate.

28:26.970 --> 28:29.461
Details of _his
sexual practices...
Are repugnant,

28:29.500 --> 28:32.435
but, in this instance, salient.
Overruled.

28:32.470 --> 28:35.075
I won't apologize
for my sexual

28:35.110 --> 28:36.998
proclivities, Ms. Krause.

28:37.040 --> 28:39.008
I like to experiment.

28:39.050 --> 28:41.371
The unexamined life,
after all...
Yet each

28:41.420 --> 28:43.479
of these practices
demonstrates a tendency

28:43.520 --> 28:46.387
towards violence,
wouldn't you agree?
The genetic fact is

28:46.420 --> 28:49.981
that women respond
to male domination.

28:50.020 --> 28:53.797
And the role of the male
is to dominate his mate,

28:53.830 --> 28:56.754
and to discipline her
when she steps out of line.

28:56.800 --> 28:58.495
It's Biblical.

28:58.530 --> 29:00.839
St. Paul: "Wives,

29:00.870 --> 29:03.088
submit to your husbands."

29:03.140 --> 29:05.461
That's all I'm here to do:

29:07.940 --> 29:10.329
will stipulate that
the sexual practices depicted
KRAUSE: Uh, Your Honor,

29:10.380 --> 29:12.143
in the show are accurate.
the defense.._. _
I'm sorry, the plaintiff,

29:12.180 --> 29:13.943
is merely trying
to interrupt the...
The defense is trying...

29:13.980 --> 29:16.949
(phone ringing)

29:21.390 --> 29:23.051
Hello, sir.

29:23.090 --> 29:24.785
I need to see you right now.

29:24.830 --> 29:26.923
About what?

29:26.960 --> 29:28.951
We'll discuss it
when you get here.

29:38.870 --> 29:40.064
Guy Redmayne.

29:40.110 --> 29:41.998
Frank Prady.

29:42.040 --> 29:43.473
Thank you for
meeting with me, uh...

29:43.510 --> 29:46.775
Sit.
(grunts)

29:48.520 --> 29:50.147
I, uh, I know
you don't have much time,

29:50.180 --> 29:52.410
so let me just say,
uh, your support,

29:52.450 --> 29:54.486
and the support
of your PAC, uh,

29:54.520 --> 29:56.078
would mean a lot
to my campaign.

29:56.120 --> 29:58.918
Uh, together we can-we can...
Well, full disclosure:

29:58.960 --> 30:01.520
I already sat down
with Alicia Florrick.

30:03.200 --> 30:04.599
Okay.

30:04.630 --> 30:07.326
Uh, well, that makes sense.
Mm-hmm.

30:07.370 --> 30:09.031
It's important to meet
both candidates,

30:09.070 --> 30:12.198
and, uh, hear our, uh,
our visions for the office.

30:12.240 --> 30:14.333
I'm thinking more
about my vision.

30:14.380 --> 30:16.109
Did you see the ass
on that broad?

30:16.140 --> 30:17.949
(chuckles)
I'm telling you,

30:17.980 --> 30:21.575
my eyes were
popping out.

30:21.620 --> 30:22.917
Oh, uh, well,

30:22.950 --> 30:24.542
well, I-I think the, uh...

30:24.590 --> 30:27.184
uh, the key difference
in our approaches...
I figure

30:27.220 --> 30:30.087
that she's a tigress
in the sack, too, right?

30:30.120 --> 30:32.588
Those buttoned-up types
almost always are.

30:32.630 --> 30:34.097
Let me-Let me start again.

30:34.130 --> 30:36.928
Give me an hour with her

30:36.960 --> 30:38.928
and she wouldn't be
walking straight

30:38.970 --> 30:41.188
for a week.
I'd split that little

30:41.240 --> 30:42.935
missy in half.

30:42.970 --> 30:45.359
What's wrong,
Mr. Prady?

30:45.410 --> 30:47.105
You got an issue?

30:47.140 --> 30:48.573
Uh, no, no, I wouldn't...

30:48.610 --> 30:50.305
I wouldn't exactly,
uh, say an issue.

30:50.340 --> 30:52.570
Uh, more a... a request.

30:52.610 --> 30:55.272
Yeah?
Mrs. Florrick
may be my opponent, but

30:55.320 --> 30:57.379
I don't really need
to denigrate her.

30:57.420 --> 30:59.217
I'm not talking
about denigrating.

30:59.250 --> 31:00.911
I'm talking about
banging that bitch

31:00.960 --> 31:02.359
till she screams like a $5,000-

31:02.390 --> 31:05.188
a-night whore.
Okay. This was interesting.

31:05.230 --> 31:07.892
You leaving?
Uh... Yeah,

31:07.930 --> 31:09.295
Mr. Redmayne, I don't know

31:09.330 --> 31:11.525
if this was, uh,
some kind of test,

31:11.570 --> 31:14.368
but my issues with Mrs. Florrick

31:14.400 --> 31:16.038
are all intellectual,

31:16.070 --> 31:17.537
not personal.

31:17.570 --> 31:19.128
Oh.

31:19.170 --> 31:21.400
Just as I thought.

31:21.440 --> 31:23.874
Just as I thought, Crystal.

31:25.710 --> 31:27.200
Get the hell
out of here.

31:28.350 --> 31:30.011
You're disgusting.

31:30.050 --> 31:31.381
Right, but I'm rich,

31:31.420 --> 31:33.957
so it really doesn't
matter, does it?

31:39.530 --> 31:42.055
Like I told you--

31:42.100 --> 31:44.523
fag. Big fag.

31:50.600 --> 31:52.136
I hope I'm not

31:52.170 --> 31:54.104
interrupting.
No.

31:54.140 --> 31:57.200
We were just basking
in the musk of each other's

31:57.240 --> 31:59.208
pheromones.
Renata, could we have a moment?

31:59.250 --> 32:03.072
A moment.
But then I need more.

32:03.120 --> 32:05.111
Mm.
(chuckles)

32:07.220 --> 32:10.053
(clears throat)

32:10.090 --> 32:12.354
So I see you've made up.
Yes.

32:12.390 --> 32:14.324
With an additional
two million

32:14.360 --> 32:16.157
holding deal on
her board seat.

32:16.200 --> 32:19.328
I was genuinely
moved

32:19.370 --> 32:21.235
by the depths to
which she would go

32:21.270 --> 32:24.205
to show I was
neglecting her.

32:24.240 --> 32:26.629
Do you think you could be
moved again in court?

32:26.670 --> 32:29.104
Why?

32:29.140 --> 32:30.698
I hear you've lost the judge.

32:30.740 --> 32:32.708
Maybe it's time
to show him another side.

32:32.750 --> 32:34.570
A sensitive side.

32:36.220 --> 32:39.519
We were married
for seven wonderful years.

32:39.550 --> 32:42.212
And at the time
of Carolyn's disappearance,

32:42.260 --> 32:44.728
how would you describe
the state of your marriage?

32:44.760 --> 32:46.250
We were deeply in love.

32:46.290 --> 32:48.554
Can you explain why,
seven years after

32:48.600 --> 32:51.068
Carolyn's death,
a show like Call It Murder

32:51.100 --> 32:53.489
would choose to portray you
as a killer?

32:53.530 --> 32:55.737
I'm notorious.

32:55.770 --> 32:58.102
The white O.J.

32:58.140 --> 33:00.404
And no matter what happens,
people will believe

33:00.440 --> 33:01.737
the worst.

33:01.780 --> 33:03.475
It's a good story.

33:03.510 --> 33:06.638
I, uh, was acquitted.

33:06.680 --> 33:10.275
I prevailed in a
wrongful death suit.

33:10.320 --> 33:12.311
There's someone now in prison
for Carolyn's murder.

33:12.350 --> 33:14.011
Her daughter.

33:14.060 --> 33:17.314
And no one will allow me
to be vindicated.

33:17.360 --> 33:21.490
No one seems to consider
how much I...

33:23.330 --> 33:24.592
...how much I miss her.

33:24.630 --> 33:27.326
How much pain

33:27.370 --> 33:29.292
I still feel.

33:29.340 --> 33:32.605
I know I'm... I'm not
a perfect man, but

33:32.640 --> 33:34.779
I loved Carolyn.

33:34.810 --> 33:36.675
And they shouldn't
be allowed

33:36.710 --> 33:38.644
to tell 15 million people

33:38.680 --> 33:40.443
that I did this.

33:40.480 --> 33:43.176
(crying)

33:43.220 --> 33:45.415
(continues crying)
I'm sorry.

33:49.660 --> 33:51.719
Dylan has a black eye.

33:51.760 --> 33:54.149
I saw.
How did he get it?

33:54.200 --> 33:56.259
Well, what did he tell you?

33:56.300 --> 33:58.689
He tripped
while leaving school.

33:58.730 --> 34:00.527
Yeah, that's what
he told me, too.

34:00.570 --> 34:03.368
You know how hard it is
to fall on your face?

34:03.400 --> 34:04.560
It's very hard.

34:04.610 --> 34:06.407
Because your arms
instinctively shoot out

34:06.440 --> 34:07.737
to protect your head.

34:07.770 --> 34:09.670
That's how you can tell
when someone's a drunk.

34:10.710 --> 34:14.441
But my son doesn't drink.

34:14.480 --> 34:17.347
So what happened
to my son?

34:18.590 --> 34:20.239
A bully hit him.

34:20.290 --> 34:22.588
And you didn't think I needed
to be made aware of this?

34:22.620 --> 34:23.609
Look, I took care of it, sir.

34:23.660 --> 34:24.786
I scared the kid off.

34:24.830 --> 34:28.493
And what did this kid look like?

34:30.260 --> 34:31.761
Mr. Bishop,
I really don't think...

34:31.800 --> 34:34.792
How hard is it to answer
one Simple question?!

34:36.300 --> 34:38.461
On the heavy side?

34:38.510 --> 34:41.570
Maybe half a foot taller
than my son.

34:41.610 --> 34:43.578
Dark hair,

34:43.610 --> 34:45.646
could use a comb.

34:45.680 --> 34:47.671
Mike Zeiler?

34:54.390 --> 34:57.382
What are you
going to do?

34:57.420 --> 34:59.183
You can go now.

34:59.230 --> 35:00.652
Look, there's
no need to be...

35:00.690 --> 35:04.694
I said... you can go.

35:25.550 --> 35:27.711
(knocking)

35:33.690 --> 35:36.420
Mr. Zeiler, it's Dylan's dad.

35:36.460 --> 35:38.690
Do you have a minute?

35:40.670 --> 35:43.764
Your son's been bullying
my son.

35:43.800 --> 35:46.701
Yes, hitting him.

35:46.740 --> 35:49.777
I-I'm sure you didn't.

35:49.810 --> 35:54.747
But you will
speak to him?

35:54.780 --> 35:57.817
Good. That's all I ask.

35:57.850 --> 36:00.842
Okay. Good evening.

36:01.960 --> 36:03.882
(phone beeps)

36:07.690 --> 36:10.193
Hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

36:10.230 --> 36:11.788
Be a parent.

36:11.830 --> 36:13.661
Do you want me
to go, sir?

36:26.810 --> 36:30.211
My dad didn't give
a rat's ass about me.

36:30.250 --> 36:32.810
He ran off_
when I was SIX.

36:35.420 --> 36:37.854
I told myself I'd never
do that to Dylan.

36:37.890 --> 36:40.723
Neven

36:40.760 --> 36:43.991
He's the only thing
I'm proud of.

36:44.030 --> 36:47.397
The only thing.

36:49.300 --> 36:52.963
Then this little
nothing of a kid

36:53.010 --> 36:55.877
makes his life hell.

36:55.910 --> 36:58.470
Not a mule from Columbia,

36:58.510 --> 37:02.241
or a Guatemalan assassin.

37:02.280 --> 37:06.683
Just a little kid,
with his day trader parents.

37:06.720 --> 37:09.257
(wry chuckle)

37:09.290 --> 37:11.724
What do I do with that?

37:13.360 --> 37:16.329
You did it.

37:19.730 --> 37:20.992
I have to go.

37:21.030 --> 37:23.669
Yeah.

37:25.370 --> 37:27.759
(overlapping arguing)
(gavel banging)

37:27.810 --> 37:28.902
Hold it. Hold it!
One at a time.

37:28.940 --> 37:29.838
DIANE: _
We renew our motion
for a directed verdict.

37:29.880 --> 37:32.542
The defendant has not carried
its burden

37:32.580 --> 37:34.912
of showing that Mr. Sweeney
killed his wife.

37:34.950 --> 37:36.645
But we have proven
that the show's depiction

37:36.680 --> 37:38.716
of Mr. Sweeney's alleged crime
is littered with falsehoods.

37:38.750 --> 37:40.945
KRAUSE:
We don't have to establish that
all the particulars are true.

37:40.990 --> 37:43.788
Only that they are
"substantially true."

37:43.820 --> 37:45.924
_ A circumstantial case
With no eyeWItnesses, Judge.

37:45.960 --> 37:47.655
Even the show
can't manufacture that.

37:47.690 --> 37:49.453
Yes, and if the standard

37:51.900 --> 37:55.597
But the standard is a
preponderance of the evidence.

37:55.640 --> 37:58.302
A low bar,
which the defendant has met.

38:00.410 --> 38:01.832
He denied your motion?

38:01.880 --> 38:03.472
DIANE: Yes. We have to put on
our rebuttal tomorrow.

38:03.510 --> 38:04.841
What's the strategy?

38:04.880 --> 38:06.643
Well, as of now,
we don't have one.

38:06.680 --> 38:07.908
I've been looking at the episode
all afternoon.

38:07.950 --> 38:09.611
I'll call you
ifI find something.

38:09.650 --> 38:11.049
Good. I'll do the same.

38:11.080 --> 38:12.843
LOOMIS (on computer):
Damn it.

38:12.890 --> 38:14.482
You're my lawyer.

38:14.520 --> 38:17.409
You have an obligation
to zealously defend me.

38:17.460 --> 38:18.825
Which I will do

38:18.860 --> 38:21.624
by making the prosecution
prove its case.

38:21.660 --> 38:24.322
Not by falsifying evidence
or by cheating.

38:24.370 --> 38:26.326
Fine, Goody Two-Shoes.

38:26.370 --> 38:28.019
I'll tell you, Debbie,

38:28.070 --> 38:31.460
when this is over,

38:31.510 --> 38:33.637
I just might fire you.

38:34.510 --> 38:36.034
No, sir.

38:36.080 --> 38:37.729
I'm firing you.

38:37.780 --> 38:41.773
Because Debbie Conlon
is not for sale.

39:03.600 --> 39:05.534
Diane, it's Alicia.

39:05.570 --> 39:07.629
I think we have a way
to force them to settle.

39:11.810 --> 39:13.141
DIANE:
Here. Here. Here.

39:13.180 --> 39:15.375
And... here.

39:15.420 --> 39:19.538
Is there a point to this or are
we just playing show-and-tell?

39:21.960 --> 39:23.712
that features
the Chumhum homepage.

39:23.760 --> 39:24.954
And on every homepage

39:24.990 --> 39:26.878
we can make out
Chummie the gopher

39:26.930 --> 39:29.819
who gets three minutes
and 42 seconds of screen time.

39:29.860 --> 39:31.999
So what?
Chummie is the
registered trademark

39:32.030 --> 39:34.021
of our billionaire client,
Chumhum.

39:34.070 --> 39:35.890
You've infringed
on their trademark.

39:35.940 --> 39:38.704
Fair use.
CARY: Nice try.

39:38.740 --> 39:40.731
Since when is trademark
disparagement fair use?

39:40.770 --> 39:41.976
Please.

39:42.010 --> 39:43.432
We didn't disparage anything.

39:43.480 --> 39:45.505
Um... you think a jury
will believe

39:45.550 --> 39:47.074
that Chummie being
in multiple scenes

39:47.110 --> 39:49.510
with a psychotic killer doesn't
disparage Mr. Gross's brand?

39:49.550 --> 39:50.949
CARY:
So, here's the thing.

39:50.980 --> 39:53.141
This case is worth
$50 million easy

39:53.190 --> 39:54.680
and we'll come after
every dollar.

39:54.720 --> 39:55.948
Or you can give
Mr. Sweeney

39:55.990 --> 39:57.617
the public apology
he deserves

39:57.660 --> 39:59.628
by taking out ads
in certain papers of record.

39:59.660 --> 40:01.082
Your choice.

40:05.770 --> 40:07.089
(gasping, choking)

40:07.130 --> 40:09.598
Time to die now.

40:11.840 --> 40:13.603
(knocking)

40:15.040 --> 40:17.008
I understand
Guy Redmayne's PAC

40:17.040 --> 40:19.747
has decided to support you.

40:19.780 --> 40:21.099
Is this a back-channel, Frank?

40:21.150 --> 40:22.708
That's a big get.

40:22.750 --> 40:24.047
A lot of money.

40:24.080 --> 40:26.719
It could make the difference
in your campaign.

40:26.750 --> 40:28.957
You've raised
a lot of money, too.
I have.

40:28.990 --> 40:33.029
He's quite a character,
isn't he: Redmayne?

40:34.090 --> 40:35.955
He is.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.752
A bit provocative?

40:39.000 --> 40:40.661
I guess.

40:41.940 --> 40:43.828
My campaign manager is angry.

40:43.870 --> 40:45.098
Why's that?

40:45.140 --> 40:46.664
He thinks Redmayne
was in my column

40:46.710 --> 40:48.928
and then he wasn't.

40:48.980 --> 40:51.972
After he spoke to you.

40:53.150 --> 40:55.641
That happens.

40:55.680 --> 40:57.079
Yes, it does.

40:57.120 --> 40:59.714
One argument is better
than another, right?

41:02.260 --> 41:05.559
Do you think this back-channel

41:05.590 --> 41:08.991
has overstayed its usefulness?

41:09.030 --> 41:11.055
I don't know.

41:11.100 --> 41:14.866
I think campaigning
is a lonely profession.

41:14.900 --> 41:17.994
And the only one who shares
that loneliness...

41:18.040 --> 41:20.531
is you.

41:31.790 --> 41:34.008
We took down the robocall--
the PAC did.

41:34.050 --> 41:35.608
I noticed.

41:35.660 --> 41:38.083
Thank you.

41:40.090 --> 41:43.093
*

41:43.130 --> 41:46.258
* Don't let us get sick

41:46.300 --> 41:49.133
* Don't let us get old

41:49.170 --> 41:54.130
* Don't let us get stupid,
all right *

41:54.170 --> 41:57.139
* Just make us be brave
Hey, Mom.

41:57.180 --> 42:00.172
* And make us play nice
Grace.

42:00.210 --> 42:03.008
You okay?
You look unhappy.

42:03.050 --> 42:06.110
(sighs):
No. Just...

42:06.150 --> 42:08.618
Nothing.

42:08.660 --> 42:10.082
What?

42:10.120 --> 42:12.680
I don't know.

42:14.190 --> 42:16.556
I don't like when people
do bad things.

42:16.600 --> 42:19.194
What people?

42:19.230 --> 42:22.131
Clients.

42:22.170 --> 42:25.560
Yeah, well, everybody's
bad in some way.

42:26.840 --> 42:29.968
I was bad today.

42:30.010 --> 42:31.807
No, Mom,
you weren't.

42:31.850 --> 42:33.306
You can't be.

42:33.350 --> 42:36.217
* Don't let us get old

42:36.250 --> 42:37.911
* Don't let us get stupid,
all right *

42:37.950 --> 42:40.589
Why?

42:40.620 --> 42:42.884
Why can't I be?

42:42.920 --> 42:46.720
Because you're the best person
I know.

42:46.760 --> 42:52.289
* Let us be together tonight

42:52.330 --> 42:55.663
* Don't let us get sick

42:55.700 --> 42:58.134
* Don't let_us get old
(crying)
No...

42:58.170 --> 43:00.001
Mom, shh.

43:00.040 --> 43:02.235
* Don't let us get stupid,
all right *
Shh, shh, shh.

43:02.280 --> 43:05.249
(crying)
Shh, it's okay.

43:05.280 --> 43:06.770
* Just make us be brave

43:06.810 --> 43:08.141
* And make us play nice...
