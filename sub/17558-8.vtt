WEBVTT

00:02.736 --> 00:03.737
(sighs)

00:07.408 --> 00:08.976
Hi, honey.
How was school?

00:09.009 --> 00:10.978
Mom, you know how we have to
give all our mobile devices

00:11.011 --> 00:13.013
to the teacher before
a test so we can't cheat?

00:13.047 --> 00:14.348
Mm-hmm.
Turns out,

00:14.382 --> 00:15.983
Wilbur has been
sneaking an iTouch

00:16.016 --> 00:17.585
under that affected
hipster hat he wears

00:17.618 --> 00:20.154
So Mr. Litchfield took away
his hat, and Wilbur went

00:20.188 --> 00:21.755
totally aggro--
he was like,

00:21.789 --> 00:22.890
"Don't touch the
bleeping hat!"

00:22.923 --> 00:25.726
It was exhilarating.
How was your day?

00:25.759 --> 00:27.061
Ooh, bleeping exhausting.

00:27.095 --> 00:29.363
This baby is sucking up
all my energy.

00:29.397 --> 00:30.398
I know what will wake you up.

00:30.431 --> 00:32.433
A dance party.

00:32.466 --> 00:34.568
No, Shania, the baby's
sleeping right now

00:34.602 --> 00:36.537
so Mommy has to stay real still.

00:36.570 --> 00:38.239
(dance music blares)
Come on!

00:38.272 --> 00:40.208
Let's dance.

00:40.241 --> 00:41.742
Hey, okay.

00:43.111 --> 00:44.212
Wiggle.

00:44.245 --> 00:45.746
Woo-hoo!

00:45.779 --> 00:47.915
Push the cart.

00:48.982 --> 00:51.885
(panting)
You know what, honey?

00:51.919 --> 00:55.189
Um, baby,
you've hardly touched

00:55.223 --> 00:56.857
your video games lately.

00:56.890 --> 01:00.294
Why don't you kill some zombies
or open a bakery or something?

01:00.328 --> 01:01.395
Okay, cool.

01:01.429 --> 01:03.030
How much screen time
can I have?

01:03.063 --> 01:05.433
Let me just close my eyes
and have a think about that.

01:05.466 --> 01:06.800
(video game buzzing and zapping)

01:06.834 --> 01:08.068
Oh, gosh.

01:09.337 --> 01:11.038
Ah, yeah.

01:11.071 --> 01:13.073
(doll squeaking)
Seven, eight, nine, 30.

01:13.107 --> 01:15.409
Okay, so you can see

01:15.443 --> 01:17.077
that doing CPR on a
baby is no different

01:17.111 --> 01:18.812
than doing CPR
on an adult.

01:18.846 --> 01:20.948
Except you can't pound on the
baby's chest and scream,

01:20.981 --> 01:22.150
"Breathe, damn it!"

01:22.183 --> 01:23.217
(laughs)

01:23.251 --> 01:24.885
Or you'll probably crush
most of its ribs

01:24.918 --> 01:26.420
and its vertebrae.
Or you could puncture

01:26.454 --> 01:28.656
the pericardium.
Look at you, very good.

01:28.689 --> 01:30.258
Exactly right, David.

01:30.291 --> 01:31.725
Okay, it's your turn.

01:31.759 --> 01:33.394
Okay.
Now, we're just gonna
dive right in

01:33.427 --> 01:35.896
to a life and death scenario.
Great.

01:35.929 --> 01:37.765
Your baby just
swallowed a button.
Oh, no.

01:37.798 --> 01:39.333
It's airway is blocked.
Okay.

01:39.367 --> 01:40.968
What's the first thing
you do-- go!

01:41.001 --> 01:42.170
Uh, make sure you have
a replacement button.

01:42.203 --> 01:43.804
Bryan, come on.
(phone chimes)

01:43.837 --> 01:44.905
Oh.
Ooh.

01:44.938 --> 01:45.839
Oh, I'm sorry, I just have

01:45.873 --> 01:47.074
a quick Twitter emergency.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.942
Now? It's life or death.

01:48.976 --> 01:49.943
Honey, this is life or death.

01:49.977 --> 01:50.944
I'm in the middle
of a horrible

01:50.978 --> 01:51.945
PR crisis at work.

01:51.979 --> 01:52.946
What happened?

01:52.980 --> 01:53.947
I spoke very loudly

01:53.981 --> 01:54.982
at one of the actresses
on Sing!

01:55.015 --> 01:56.284
because she showed up late

01:56.317 --> 01:58.252
to rehearsal
and reeked of John Mayer.

01:58.286 --> 01:59.353
Okay.
And then,
she tweets

01:59.387 --> 02:01.021
about it, and now all
of Twitter is saying

02:01.054 --> 02:03.757
that I'm mean, and my face
is doughy and bloodless.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.793
Which actress was it? Was
it the bohemian one? Okay...

02:05.826 --> 02:07.161
No, that's a different one.

02:07.195 --> 02:09.029
Ooh, she seems like a real pain
in the ass, that one.

02:09.062 --> 02:10.198
She is a pain in the...

02:10.231 --> 02:11.699
I could tell you stories
that would curl your hair.

02:11.732 --> 02:12.633
Guys, baby.

02:12.666 --> 02:13.801
Yeah.
Oh.

02:13.834 --> 02:15.536
Just let me finish this
real quick for work.

02:15.569 --> 02:18.005
That's what you said last night,
when I caught you on Dlisted

02:18.038 --> 02:19.440
reading about how Brazil
needs One Direction.

02:19.473 --> 02:20.474
(gasps):
They do.

02:20.508 --> 02:21.342
This is my work, honey.

02:21.375 --> 02:22.643
(phone chimes)

02:22.676 --> 02:24.178
Is that me or you?
That's not me.

02:24.212 --> 02:26.046
Oh, it's me. Jennifer Love
Hewitt Google alert.

02:26.079 --> 02:27.648
Ooh.
She's getting takeout
in Brentwood. Yeah.

02:27.681 --> 02:29.283
Chinese?
No. Indian.

02:29.317 --> 02:30.818
Huh?
What's the story
behind that?

02:30.851 --> 02:32.052
Guys, come on.

02:32.085 --> 02:33.454
Sorry. Yes.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.656
Okay.
(phone chimes)

02:35.689 --> 02:37.525
Ooh. Oh!
Oh. Ooh, it's a ratings update.

02:37.558 --> 02:39.860
What did they say?
Yeah, it's the live plus
threes. That's the DVR numbers.

02:39.893 --> 02:42.129
That's really the only thing
that matters now.
That's what I heard.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.832
Is the live
plus threes.
You know what
else matters now?

02:44.865 --> 02:46.467
Oh, yes.

02:46.500 --> 02:47.735
Yeah, okay.
Yuh-huh. And how.

02:48.569 --> 02:49.870
Aah, what do I do?!

02:49.903 --> 02:50.738
BOTH:
Open the airway.

02:50.771 --> 02:52.506
(phone chimes)
Ooh.

02:52.540 --> 02:53.974
Oh. (laughs)
Okay.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.008
(laughter)

02:55.042 --> 02:57.044
It's so Pavlovian,
isn't it?

02:57.077 --> 02:58.145
As soon as you hear a ding,

02:58.178 --> 02:59.813
you just reach
for your phone.
Right?

02:59.847 --> 03:01.482
It's like our brain is now
trained to do it that way.

03:01.515 --> 03:02.716
Whenever I hear
a ding or a ring,

03:02.750 --> 03:04.585
I'm like a dog in a car.

03:04.618 --> 03:05.753
(laughter)

03:05.786 --> 03:07.688
It's like the ding
is the new ring.
Hey...

03:07.721 --> 03:10.157
I'm gonna tweet that.
I'm gonna retweet it.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.360
I'm gonna take a picture
of you retweeting,

03:12.393 --> 03:14.328
and then we're gonna
Instagram it.
Oh.

03:14.362 --> 03:17.030
Nice. (beeping)
Well, that's not me.

03:17.064 --> 03:19.066
Oh, it's not me.
That actually could be me.

03:19.099 --> 03:20.834
No, it's not...

03:20.868 --> 03:22.035
Oh.

03:22.069 --> 03:23.437
(beeping)

03:23.471 --> 03:24.438
Oh.

03:24.472 --> 03:27.040
Sometimes you can save 'em,

03:27.074 --> 03:29.209
and sometimes you can't.

03:29.243 --> 03:30.878
So what happened with
that Bohemian girl?

03:30.911 --> 03:32.380
Does she smell as
bad as she looks?

03:32.413 --> 03:33.547
Well, every time she walks

03:33.581 --> 03:34.948
out of her damn trailer,
it's like Woodstock

03:34.982 --> 03:35.949
just waft...
it's like a burning...

03:35.983 --> 03:37.150
CARLA:
I can smell her from my couch.

03:40.153 --> 03:41.389
Right this way.

03:41.422 --> 03:43.791
Thanks.

03:43.824 --> 03:45.058
(glasses clink)

03:45.092 --> 03:47.461
I bet this is a
first for you.

03:47.495 --> 03:49.096
Having lunch
with a black person.

03:49.129 --> 03:50.564
I will have you know

03:50.598 --> 03:54.268
that I once had brunch
with Mr. Nipsey Russell.

03:54.302 --> 03:55.803
I won a contest.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.605
You know, the first
11 times I met you,

03:57.638 --> 03:58.772
I felt like choking you out.

03:58.806 --> 04:00.541
But now I see, you
just speak your mind.

04:00.574 --> 04:01.742
We're not so different, Jane.

04:01.775 --> 04:03.911
Please. Call me Mrs. Forrest.

04:03.944 --> 04:05.879
And don't get too
carried away with yourself.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.481
We had drinks on Halloween.

04:07.515 --> 04:08.916
Doesn't mean
we're gonna start

04:08.949 --> 04:10.718
swapping underpants
anytime soon.

04:10.751 --> 04:13.287
Well, good, because
I'm not wearing any.

04:13.321 --> 04:15.122
I'm just saying,
we're both smart women

04:15.155 --> 04:16.824
with strong opinions
and life goals.

04:16.857 --> 04:19.493
Oh, yeah?
What are your life goals?

04:19.527 --> 04:22.463
Well, being Bryan's assistant
is just a stepping stone for me.

04:22.496 --> 04:24.965
Pretty soon, I'll
produce my own TV shows,

04:24.998 --> 04:26.734
I'll own a ranch
in Santa Barbara

04:26.767 --> 04:28.302
and have my own assistant.

04:28.336 --> 04:29.570
You interested?

04:29.603 --> 04:31.805
Thanks, no. I have my own plans.

04:31.839 --> 04:33.807
You see, since
I'm going to be here

04:33.841 --> 04:35.175
until Goldie delivers the baby,

04:35.208 --> 04:37.611
I thought I'd get my California
real estate license.

04:37.645 --> 04:40.514
I start classes
at the Learning Annex next week.

04:40.548 --> 04:42.316
The Annex?
Yeah.

04:42.350 --> 04:43.517
Get with the times, woman.

04:43.551 --> 04:45.786
Take those classes
online right now.

04:45.819 --> 04:47.321
The Internet is for porn mongers

04:47.355 --> 04:49.457
and people too rude to write
a proper thank-you note.

04:49.490 --> 04:51.592
Anyway, I am a people person.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.427
I did fine in Ohio
with just a flyer

04:53.461 --> 04:55.463
and an ad in the Yellow Pages.

04:55.496 --> 04:57.030
Well, you know,
in today's world,

04:57.064 --> 04:59.600
if you don't exist online,
you don't exist.

04:59.633 --> 05:02.636
Now, at some point, you'll need
to figure out your brand--

05:02.670 --> 05:04.772
what you do, why
you do it better

05:04.805 --> 05:07.875
and how to turn that into
a customized fragrance.

05:07.908 --> 05:11.311
In the meantime, we can get
you set up with an e-mail,

05:11.345 --> 05:13.180
a Web site and a
Twitter account.

05:13.213 --> 05:14.348
How long will all that take?

05:14.382 --> 05:15.516
Here's your
Twitter account.

05:15.549 --> 05:18.018
But that didn't take
but two seconds of work.

05:18.051 --> 05:20.153
Your people must love
this Internet.

05:20.187 --> 05:22.823
Look, when you want to say
something to the world,

05:22.856 --> 05:25.158
you type it right
here on Twitter.

05:25.192 --> 05:27.495
Now, you're gonna need

05:27.528 --> 05:29.663
to think before you...

05:29.697 --> 05:33.801
Oh, my God. It's like giving
a monkey a loaded gun.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.536
Bryan, can you grab
the salad dressing?

05:35.569 --> 05:36.737
It's in the other bag.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.338
(video game chirping)

05:38.372 --> 05:40.408
Bryan?
Yes. What?

05:40.441 --> 05:42.075
Dressing.
Yes.

05:42.109 --> 05:43.176
Shania, come to the table,
please.

05:44.445 --> 05:45.979
(humming)
Hey, David,

05:46.013 --> 05:48.048
I'm IM-ing with my
friend, and her father's

05:48.081 --> 05:50.350
complaining of an inflammation
in his right thigh.

05:50.384 --> 05:52.720
I went on WebMD, and I
think it might be phlebitis,

05:52.753 --> 05:53.921
but what do you think?

05:53.954 --> 05:55.489
Warning: may be graphic.

05:55.523 --> 05:57.157
Oh, my God, that's phlebitis.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.358
Who is your friend?

05:58.392 --> 05:59.993
Ngabile. She lives

06:00.027 --> 06:01.361
in... Zambia.

06:01.395 --> 06:03.196
Zambia. Oh,
I should tweet that.

06:03.230 --> 06:04.164
Yeah. Sing! should do

06:04.197 --> 06:05.232
a cover of
Toto's "Africa."

06:05.265 --> 06:07.367
"Love or hate?
Vote, and you decide."

06:07.401 --> 06:09.403
Look, this is a great PR tool.
Watch how this will work.

06:09.437 --> 06:10.838
Shania, put that away, please.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.606
Mom, I'm trying to
save a man's life.

06:12.640 --> 06:13.774
You know, I read online

06:13.807 --> 06:15.375
that the whole
eating-for-two thing is a myth,

06:15.409 --> 06:16.610
but I don't care.

06:16.644 --> 06:18.579
I'm gonna eat enough
for triplets. (laughs)

06:18.612 --> 06:20.414
Guys?

06:20.448 --> 06:22.082
Guys?

06:22.115 --> 06:25.719
Guys!
No. Bryan.
He's constantly on that thing.

06:25.753 --> 06:27.287
David, you are on your phone
almost as much as I'm on mine.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.623
I am a doctor.
I have patients who need me.

06:29.657 --> 06:33.093
Yeah, you are trying to buy
a golf putter on eBay.

06:33.126 --> 06:34.528
Hey! I bring life
into the world.

06:34.562 --> 06:36.430
Well, I inform and
entertain millions.

06:36.464 --> 06:38.899
Who wouldn't be here if I didn't
bring them into the world.

06:38.932 --> 06:41.068
Well...
Oh! Oh, my God,
I won the putter.

06:41.101 --> 06:43.737
You can click "Buy It Now," but
you're just overpaying. Suckahs!

06:43.771 --> 06:46.273
SHANIA: Ngabile's dad needs
an anticoagulant.

06:46.306 --> 06:47.741
I should look up the
contra-indications.

06:47.775 --> 06:48.742
Mm-hmm.
All right,
enough!

06:48.776 --> 06:49.910
This is crazy!

06:49.943 --> 06:51.311
I'd get more face time
with you guys

06:51.344 --> 06:52.746
if we were actually
on FaceTime.

06:52.780 --> 06:54.281
Goldie's right.

06:54.314 --> 06:55.449
We can't be like this

06:55.483 --> 06:56.617
when the baby
gets here.

06:56.650 --> 06:57.818
I know. This is just terrible.

06:57.851 --> 07:00.287
We need to try to be present
for our child.

07:00.320 --> 07:02.222
I think we need to wean
ourselves off of technology now.

07:02.255 --> 07:03.557
Well, I read online
that Rita Wilson

07:03.591 --> 07:05.058
and her family do this thing
on Saturdays

07:05.092 --> 07:06.426
where they go
completely tech-free.

07:06.460 --> 07:07.795
Why don't we do that?

07:07.828 --> 07:09.329
Yeah, we could just do one day
totally tech-free.

07:09.362 --> 07:10.998
Shania, give me your iPad.

07:11.031 --> 07:13.433
No, wait! You're being
incredibly impetuous,

07:13.467 --> 07:15.335
which is a word I learned
from Word of the Day

07:15.368 --> 07:16.904
on dictionary.com.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.238
You can't take it away!

07:18.271 --> 07:19.740
How will I grow? How
will I learn new things?

07:19.773 --> 07:21.341
Shh, shh. No more discussion.

07:21.374 --> 07:22.610
This will be good for us.

07:22.643 --> 07:23.644
Are you in?

07:23.677 --> 07:25.312
I'm in,

07:25.345 --> 07:27.180
but Bryan can't go unplugged
even for a minute.

07:27.214 --> 07:29.049
A minute?
Of course, I can.

07:30.350 --> 07:31.919
Just let me set the timer
on my iPhone.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.654
(beeps)

07:33.687 --> 07:35.823
Why are you all looking at me?
She's the junkie.

07:42.195 --> 07:45.298
Oh, good.
I have more questions for you

07:45.332 --> 07:46.500
about the computer.

07:46.534 --> 07:47.835
Hold on. I'm sexting
with my boyfriend.

07:47.868 --> 07:49.036
You want

07:49.069 --> 07:50.804
to kiss my "inbred" thighs?

07:50.838 --> 07:52.339
Darnell! Oh.

07:52.372 --> 07:55.208
Autocorrect. He meant, I want
to kiss your inner thighs.

07:55.242 --> 07:57.044
"I love you,
too, Darnell,

07:57.077 --> 07:58.612
you dirty dog."

07:58.646 --> 08:00.881
My God, is nothing
sacred anymore?!

08:00.914 --> 08:02.516
Don't you realize

08:02.550 --> 08:05.619
that sexual congress is the last
intimacy two people can share,

08:05.653 --> 08:07.187
and now with this device,

08:07.220 --> 08:09.623
that's gonna go the way
of the elevator operator.

08:09.657 --> 08:12.292
Honey, virtual sex is better
than real sex.

08:12.325 --> 08:13.326
When we're done,

08:13.360 --> 08:15.362
I don't have to cuddle my man.

08:15.395 --> 08:18.666
I can just order me a pair
of new slippers online.

08:18.699 --> 08:21.234
Now what's your computer
question, Mrs. Garrett?

08:21.268 --> 08:24.805
What?! You have 422 followers?!

08:24.838 --> 08:26.006
Is that a lot?
How?

08:26.039 --> 08:27.374
Yesterday, you didn't know
the difference

08:27.407 --> 08:29.009
between a hashtag
or a skin tag.

08:29.042 --> 08:30.844
There is nothing
to this Twitter.

08:30.878 --> 08:32.646
See, look, I log in

08:32.680 --> 08:35.248
as @NanaUrBusiness--
that's my handle.

08:35.282 --> 08:36.550
Mm-hmm.

08:36.584 --> 08:38.051
I say what I always say,

08:38.085 --> 08:40.988
and these screen-worshipping
chair potatoes think I'm edgy.

08:41.021 --> 08:42.923
ROCKY:
"If you follow Rachel Maddow,

08:42.956 --> 08:44.658
punch yourself
in your hairy crotch."

08:44.692 --> 08:46.894
Mm-hmm.
Oh, my God, you
cannot say all that!

08:46.927 --> 08:48.195
I can, and I did.

08:48.228 --> 08:49.597
Okay, well,
tweet whatever you want,

08:49.630 --> 08:51.231
but don't say
I didn't warn you.

08:51.264 --> 08:53.200
I know exactly what I'm doing.

08:53.233 --> 08:54.868
At NanaUrBusiness
is gonna make me

08:54.902 --> 08:57.004
the biggest real estate
agent in this town.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.439
The more I tell it like it is,
the more followers I get.

08:59.472 --> 09:01.374
Hmm.
Now show me how
to add photos and videos.

09:01.408 --> 09:04.511
Okay, I'm probably going to burn
for this, but you download

09:04.544 --> 09:06.279
your photos and videos
to your desktop,

09:06.313 --> 09:09.082
attach it to you Twitter,
hit "Send,"

09:09.116 --> 09:12.452
and share it
with your 422 twisted followers.

09:12.485 --> 09:14.354
Whatever. Just show me
an example.

09:14.387 --> 09:17.224
Okay. I have some hilarious
Auto-Tune news.

09:17.257 --> 09:19.292
A dog
that can't stop sneezing.

09:19.326 --> 09:20.060
Oh.
(phone buzzing)

09:20.093 --> 09:21.695
Hold on.

09:21.729 --> 09:24.031
Darnell is squatting
over the camera.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.065
I need a moment.

09:25.999 --> 09:28.702
You need a pastor.

09:28.736 --> 09:31.304
"For Your Eyes Only."

09:31.338 --> 09:34.074
Oh. This looks interesting.

09:34.107 --> 09:36.543
(playing gentle melody)

09:36.576 --> 09:39.647
* From a club that smells
like desperation *

09:39.680 --> 09:44.417
* To our wedding day,
I just want to say *

09:44.451 --> 09:48.421
* Let's push a stroller,
just me and you *

09:48.455 --> 09:52.626
* You're my Dr. Davey,
and I'm your dude *

09:52.660 --> 09:56.997
* We'll ourselves a family,
our own little brood... *

09:57.030 --> 10:00.067
* Ah, ah, ah, ah... *

10:00.100 --> 10:03.804
* All we need's a test tube
and a hand full of lube... *

10:03.837 --> 10:05.505
Oh, my God.

10:05.538 --> 10:08.175
This is the gayest thing
ever.

10:10.010 --> 10:13.914
"The Gayest Video Ever."

10:13.947 --> 10:16.016
Attach, okay, send.

10:17.685 --> 10:21.288
Bret Easton Ellis
is following me?

10:21.321 --> 10:22.956
Blocked.

10:22.990 --> 10:24.524
DAVID:
This was a good idea.

10:24.557 --> 10:26.326
Making dinner
as a family,

10:26.359 --> 10:27.627
no interruptions
from our phones.

10:27.661 --> 10:29.162
It's kind of liberating.

10:29.196 --> 10:31.098
Yeah, I wish I could
Instagram a picture

10:31.131 --> 10:32.532
of my relaxed
face right now.

10:32.565 --> 10:34.301
GOLDIE:
Oh, baby,

10:34.334 --> 10:35.468
what are you wearing?

10:35.502 --> 10:36.704
It's my pilgrim costume

10:36.737 --> 10:38.038
for my school's
Thanksgiving play.

10:38.071 --> 10:39.372
You are so Kelly McGillis

10:39.406 --> 10:40.540
in Witness right now.

10:40.573 --> 10:42.042
Or Helena
Bonham-Carter
in anything.

10:42.075 --> 10:44.311
Don't you think you're taking
this a little too far, sweetie?

10:44.344 --> 10:45.779
No. You said you wanted
to give up technology.

10:45.813 --> 10:48.015
And if you're truly
serious about that,

10:48.048 --> 10:50.017
if you really want to connect
with your child,

10:50.050 --> 10:52.019
then it shouldn't just include
phones and tablets.

10:52.052 --> 10:54.287
It should include all
modern conveniences.

10:54.321 --> 10:57.124
Unless, you aren't able
to take this seriously.

10:57.157 --> 10:57.825
Oh.

10:57.858 --> 10:58.892
Fine.

10:58.926 --> 10:59.960
Let's do this.

10:59.993 --> 11:00.961
Tonight we're
gonna party

11:00.994 --> 11:03.196
like it's 1799.

11:03.230 --> 11:04.031
Okay.

11:04.064 --> 11:06.033
Uh...
Do we all
get bonnets?

11:06.066 --> 11:07.534
I think I cut
my finger off.

11:07.567 --> 11:09.602
(playing light melody)

11:15.042 --> 11:16.744
Sweetie!
Well done!

11:16.777 --> 11:19.412
What a talent!
So good.

11:19.446 --> 11:21.815
Finally, dinner.

11:21.849 --> 11:23.150
Well, I love
this candlelight.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.517
It makes me look like I'm 14.

11:24.551 --> 11:26.019
Well, technically,
the candles are cheating

11:26.053 --> 11:27.387
because we didn't make
them ourselves.

11:27.420 --> 11:28.722
Yeah, but Martha
Stewart did.

11:28.756 --> 11:29.923
No, she really did.

11:29.957 --> 11:31.224
In her Connecticut
farmhouse.

11:31.258 --> 11:32.525
She rendered
the tallow fat

11:32.559 --> 11:34.594
from her beloved but
slower-moving pets,

11:34.627 --> 11:36.663
and then she added
vanilla beans

11:36.696 --> 11:38.198
and then she poured it
all into molds.

11:38.231 --> 11:40.000
And yeah,
so we're good.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.669
Still, without the technological
advances of modern science,

11:42.702 --> 11:44.504
we wouldn't have antibiotics,

11:44.537 --> 11:46.406
refrigerated foods,
public sanitation.

11:46.439 --> 11:48.942
Our life expectancy
would be 38.

11:48.976 --> 11:50.710
Ticktock, fellas.

11:52.645 --> 11:53.781
Well, these tomatoes
look fabulous.

11:53.814 --> 11:55.749
Are these from
the farmers' market?

11:55.783 --> 11:57.851
No, I got them from the
neighbors across the way.

11:57.885 --> 11:59.019
They have a whole garden,

11:59.052 --> 12:00.220
and they're really nice
about sharing.

12:00.253 --> 12:01.388
The neighbors
in the brick house?

12:01.421 --> 12:02.555
People live there?

12:02.589 --> 12:04.624
They can totally see into
your master bathroom

12:04.657 --> 12:06.026
from their guest room balcony.

12:06.059 --> 12:08.261
(chokes)
See? When we put down

12:08.295 --> 12:09.596
our electronic gadgets,

12:09.629 --> 12:10.864
it really gives
us a chance

12:10.898 --> 12:12.065
to connect with people.

12:12.099 --> 12:13.600
Yeah, because before
we had all these gadgets,

12:13.633 --> 12:15.368
it was downright barbaric.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.437
Yeah, Shania, houses
only had one phone

12:17.470 --> 12:18.605
and they were connected
to the wall

12:18.638 --> 12:20.473
with a cord. And then
if you were trying to

12:20.507 --> 12:22.209
reach somebody who was already
talking to somebody else,

12:22.242 --> 12:23.376
you would hear
this terrible sound.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.145
It would go err, err, err!

12:25.178 --> 12:26.914
DAVID:
And when you wanted
the news, an old,

12:26.947 --> 12:28.916
out-of-shape white man
would come on your television

12:28.949 --> 12:31.051
at 6:00 p.m. and actually
read it to you.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.219
Things were simpler

12:32.252 --> 12:33.420
back then.

12:33.453 --> 12:34.721
I mean, it would be nice

12:34.754 --> 12:36.089
for our kid
to experience that.

12:36.123 --> 12:37.490
Even just
for a little.

12:37.524 --> 12:39.827
I know. 'Cause how often
do we get the opportunity

12:39.860 --> 12:41.428
just to really, you
know, sit around

12:41.461 --> 12:42.629
and talk to each other?

12:42.662 --> 12:44.631
Yeah.

12:44.664 --> 12:46.666
(crickets chirping)

12:50.303 --> 12:51.304
I'm gonna use
the restroom.

12:51.338 --> 12:52.305
Awesome.
Yeah.

12:52.339 --> 12:53.673
Okay. Is that
all right

12:53.706 --> 12:55.075
or did you dig a hole
in the backyard?

12:55.108 --> 12:57.510
Please, we're not animals.

12:57.544 --> 13:00.113
But just don't use
the seat warmer.

13:05.452 --> 13:06.519
What are you doing in here?

13:06.553 --> 13:07.487
What?

13:07.520 --> 13:09.823
I am very disappointed in you.

13:09.857 --> 13:11.024
I'm sorry.

13:11.058 --> 13:12.759
I was checking my fantasy
football league.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.094
I love Goldie
and Shania,

13:14.127 --> 13:15.695
but I have $15
riding on this.

13:15.728 --> 13:17.664
I know. Life without
technology sucks.

13:17.697 --> 13:18.866
I'd rather get stuck
in an elevator

13:18.899 --> 13:20.800
with Neve Campbell
than repeat this day.
Come on.

13:20.834 --> 13:22.135
Since I cheated,
you get to, too.

13:22.169 --> 13:23.470
Five minutes. I'll
watch the door.

13:23.503 --> 13:24.872
Yay, Twitter.

13:24.905 --> 13:27.040
If I don't know who Rihanna
is mad at-slash-forgiving

13:27.074 --> 13:29.142
at any given moment,
I just go crazy.

13:29.176 --> 13:31.044
In order to do some damage
control over my nightmare

13:31.078 --> 13:33.380
at work, last week I posted
a deleted scene from Sing!

13:33.413 --> 13:34.514
Oh.
Clea sings

13:34.547 --> 13:36.316
a Taylor Swift duet
with a pony.
Ooh.

13:36.349 --> 13:37.384
Can't wait to feel
the Twitter love.

13:37.417 --> 13:38.718
(clicks)

13:38.751 --> 13:39.552
This is weird.

13:39.586 --> 13:40.653
What?
I have, like,

13:40.687 --> 13:41.721
a bazillion comments

13:41.754 --> 13:43.390
about some viral video called

13:43.423 --> 13:44.824
"The Gayest Video Ever."

13:44.858 --> 13:46.059
(clicks)

13:47.594 --> 13:49.496
* Muddling mint for mojitos

13:49.529 --> 13:51.464
* And sipping white wine

13:51.498 --> 13:55.568
* Burning a smudge stick
of sage and thyme *

13:55.602 --> 13:59.639
* Hikes in the canyon
with Smelly the dog *

13:59.672 --> 14:01.975
* Our jaunts to San Fran

14:02.009 --> 14:04.344
* Holding hands in the fog

14:04.377 --> 14:05.845
* You nursed me to health

14:05.879 --> 14:08.048
* When I had SARS

14:08.081 --> 14:10.017
Who in the hell would
humiliate me like this?

14:10.050 --> 14:11.318
*

14:11.351 --> 14:12.419
Um...

14:12.452 --> 14:14.721
"NanaUrBusiness."

14:16.623 --> 14:18.625
Well, we have to move.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.562
(rapid, loud knocking)

14:26.399 --> 14:28.368
I want your phone,
your computer, your flare gun,

14:28.401 --> 14:30.070
whatever you use to contact
the outside world.

14:30.103 --> 14:31.104
What are you talking about?

14:31.138 --> 14:33.206
You leaked my video
to the world.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.342
Oh, come on,
it was hilarious.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.877
And I thought you were so proud
of your love for your man.

14:37.911 --> 14:39.412
Anyway, humiliating you

14:39.446 --> 14:42.882
brought 900 new followers to my
ever-growing Twitter fan base.

14:42.916 --> 14:44.284
That video was meant for David

14:44.317 --> 14:45.552
as a surprise
on our wedding day,

14:45.585 --> 14:46.719
and it was private.

14:46.753 --> 14:48.688
If you want privacy,
go diddle a Bundt cake

14:48.721 --> 14:49.923
in the bathtub,

14:49.957 --> 14:51.191
but don't have a camera crew

14:51.224 --> 14:52.392
record you
while you're doing it

14:52.425 --> 14:54.427
and then whine
when it gets leaked.

14:54.461 --> 14:55.728
You were asking for this.

14:55.762 --> 14:56.863
Uh-uh, Maude.

14:56.896 --> 14:57.864
I had all of those

14:57.897 --> 14:59.532
crew members sign
non-disclosure agreements.

14:59.566 --> 15:00.700
Oh, please.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.402
Nowadays, you can't
slander someone

15:02.435 --> 15:04.571
in the back of a cab
without it being recorded.

15:04.604 --> 15:06.106
Nothing is private anymore.

15:06.139 --> 15:07.774
If you can't
do the time,

15:07.807 --> 15:09.542
don't record the crime.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.444
I cannot believe you did this.

15:11.478 --> 15:13.213
I feel extremely violated.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.115
Well, how do you think
the rest of us feel

15:15.148 --> 15:18.651
when you dance like a Vietnamese
kid running across a minefield.

15:18.685 --> 15:21.621
God, these gays
are so... sensitive.

15:26.626 --> 15:29.096
* You nursed me to health
when I had SARS *

15:29.129 --> 15:30.497
(beep, music stops)

15:30.530 --> 15:33.500
* You were on the bed,
I like to please my guy... *

15:33.533 --> 15:35.235
(beep, music stops)

15:35.268 --> 15:39.506
* That's what Rocky calls
keeping it real *

15:39.539 --> 15:41.808
(beep, music stops)

15:41.841 --> 15:44.444
* White parties
in Palm Springs *

15:44.477 --> 15:46.246
* You remember François

15:46.279 --> 15:47.814
* The time you got
the Lady Dis *

15:47.847 --> 15:50.083
* On the cruise to Panama...

15:50.117 --> 15:51.618
Okay, you guys.

15:51.651 --> 15:52.952
(music stops)

15:52.986 --> 15:55.422
Phones, gadgets,
anything with a screen,

15:55.455 --> 15:56.956
put 'em in here.

15:56.990 --> 15:58.458
Come on, come on.

15:58.491 --> 16:00.927
No more technology
at work, you guys.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.762
It's unprofessional,
it's a time-suck.

16:02.795 --> 16:03.963
Get it in.

16:03.997 --> 16:05.332
In, in, in.
No phones,

16:05.365 --> 16:07.167
no PDAs. If you
have to bring in

16:07.200 --> 16:08.201
a source of
information,

16:08.235 --> 16:09.469
bring in a newspaper.

16:09.502 --> 16:11.004
You, too, Devin.

16:11.038 --> 16:12.205
No, no, no, no.

16:12.239 --> 16:13.406
I don't have time
for your acting.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.309
Quick, quick, quick.

16:16.343 --> 16:17.844
Get it in.
Oh, come on.

16:17.877 --> 16:19.212
Be smarter
than the trash can.

16:19.246 --> 16:21.214
So now that we're free

16:21.248 --> 16:23.050
of all of this
nonsense,

16:23.083 --> 16:25.018
we can focus
on our craft.

16:25.052 --> 16:26.119
Now, we have
a big Carly Rae Jep...

16:26.153 --> 16:27.387
Mmm.

16:27.420 --> 16:28.821
What's happening?
Mmm.

16:29.856 --> 16:31.591
Mmm.
Okay.

16:32.659 --> 16:33.793
We saw your video,

16:33.826 --> 16:35.162
and the side you
show America

16:35.195 --> 16:36.696
is so raw and
authentic. It's like

16:36.729 --> 16:38.365
you pulled back the curtains
to show everybody

16:38.398 --> 16:42.369
who you really are.
I mean, that is so brave, man.

16:42.402 --> 16:44.204
Mm-hmm.
Hmm.

16:44.237 --> 16:45.638
You can un-pucker.
You still can't

16:45.672 --> 16:46.806
have time off
to sing at the Nobel

16:46.839 --> 16:48.675
Peace Prize ceremony.

16:48.708 --> 16:50.743
Clea.
I'm so glad the
Twitter-sphere sees you

16:50.777 --> 16:52.212
the way I see
my Bry-Bry,

16:52.245 --> 16:53.846
a kindhearted
open soul,

16:53.880 --> 16:55.415
not afraid
to sing his feelings.

16:55.448 --> 16:57.217
You can keep your phone.
You're my favorite.

16:57.250 --> 16:58.751
I heart you.
I heart you.

16:58.785 --> 16:59.719
"Thank you

16:59.752 --> 17:01.354
@NanaUrBusiness and

17:01.388 --> 17:03.890
@MrBryanCollins for showing
us all what real love is."

17:03.923 --> 17:05.858
(gasps)
#Bryan-Is-A-Softie

17:05.892 --> 17:07.060
is trending.
Huh, wha-what?

17:07.094 --> 17:07.794
Whoo!

17:10.363 --> 17:12.065
Okay, okay, you guys.

17:12.099 --> 17:14.601
Now, the next ten minutes
of this dance rehearsal,

17:14.634 --> 17:17.870
I want you all to retweet
my video to your followers.

17:17.904 --> 17:19.372
Come on. Retweet!

17:19.406 --> 17:20.407
Retweet party!

17:20.440 --> 17:22.242
Come on!
Quick, quick, quick.

17:22.275 --> 17:23.376
Tweet, tweet, tweet.

17:23.410 --> 17:25.712
This is the power
of social media, you guys.

17:25.745 --> 17:27.647
Use it for good!

17:30.217 --> 17:31.751
Mother.

17:31.784 --> 17:32.919
Mother,

17:32.952 --> 17:34.387
dawn is breaking.

17:34.421 --> 17:35.855
Mother.

17:35.888 --> 17:36.889
Mom!

17:36.923 --> 17:38.858
What? What is it?
Are you okay?

17:38.891 --> 17:40.293
The sun is near risen.

17:40.327 --> 17:42.095
There's hardly time
to start the fire

17:42.129 --> 17:43.596
to boil water for our baths.

17:43.630 --> 17:45.565
It's pitch-black out.
No matter.

17:45.598 --> 17:47.234
We must grind the corn
for bread,

17:47.267 --> 17:48.901
there are socks
that need darning...

17:48.935 --> 17:50.103
Okay, okay.

17:50.137 --> 17:51.003
I get it.

17:52.805 --> 17:53.940
You win.

17:55.575 --> 17:56.309
(groans)

17:56.343 --> 17:57.444
Here.

17:57.477 --> 17:59.078
Just please

17:59.112 --> 18:01.314
let me sleep.
And promise me

18:01.348 --> 18:02.949
if we're ever in front
of your friends' parents

18:02.982 --> 18:04.617
and I say
I only let you have

18:04.651 --> 18:06.153
one hour
of screen time a day,

18:06.186 --> 18:07.787
you won't call me out
as a liar.

18:08.955 --> 18:11.324
Thank God I'm part
of the world again.

18:11.358 --> 18:14.327
But, Mom, I did learn
something from all this.

18:14.361 --> 18:16.896
I'll use these
devices responsibly,

18:16.929 --> 18:19.399
as the powerful
tools they are,

18:19.432 --> 18:22.569
an evolutionary step
in human connection.

18:22.602 --> 18:25.305
But I also value
hands-on experiences.

18:25.338 --> 18:28.241
I mean, you can watch a
video on how to bake bread,

18:28.275 --> 18:30.677
but you can't feel the dough
between your fingers

18:30.710 --> 18:32.245
or smell it baking

18:32.279 --> 18:35.014
or share the laughter
and closeness that we...

18:35.047 --> 18:36.616
Mom?

18:54.634 --> 18:55.968
Well, I am proud of us.

18:56.002 --> 18:58.037
Two nights in a row,

18:58.070 --> 19:00.173
living tech-free,
going off the grid.

19:00.207 --> 19:02.175
I feel like a
frontier man.

19:02.209 --> 19:04.177
A frontier man
who wears eye cream.

19:04.211 --> 19:05.278
(chuckles)

19:05.312 --> 19:07.547
It was nice having
a candlelit dinner with you

19:07.580 --> 19:09.182
and talking about
potential baby names.

19:09.216 --> 19:10.450
I love that. I mean,

19:10.483 --> 19:12.018
when was the last time
we spent a Saturday night

19:12.051 --> 19:13.386
not checking our e-mails

19:13.420 --> 19:15.021
and watching
48 Hours Mystery?

19:15.054 --> 19:16.055
I don't know,
I kind of missed seeing

19:16.088 --> 19:17.390
what the title
was tonight though.

19:17.424 --> 19:18.291
That's true.

19:18.325 --> 19:19.559
"Nightmare in Napa."

19:19.592 --> 19:20.793
(laughs)

19:20.827 --> 19:23.029
"Two Wigs, a Gun,
and a Murder."

19:23.062 --> 19:24.897
"The Lady in the Pool."

19:24.931 --> 19:26.899
(laughing)

19:26.933 --> 19:28.801
You know, we haven't
talked about it yet,

19:28.835 --> 19:30.537
but that video
that you made...

19:30.570 --> 19:32.505
Oh, David...

19:33.540 --> 19:35.708
I'm sorry it went so public.

19:35.742 --> 19:36.409
I loved it.

19:36.443 --> 19:38.044
You did?
Yeah.

19:38.077 --> 19:39.746
I mean, I know that
a billion people saw it but...

19:39.779 --> 19:42.349
all this talk about us
not connecting,

19:42.382 --> 19:44.751
that song reminded me
of how much we share.

19:46.386 --> 19:49.856
I loved our jaunts
to San Francisco

19:49.889 --> 19:52.158
and holding hands
in the fog,

19:52.191 --> 19:53.760
muddling mojitos.

19:53.793 --> 19:56.729
A little shocked François
got a shout-out...
Well...

19:56.763 --> 19:59.198
but otherwise,

19:59.232 --> 20:01.734
I thought it was
incredibly sweet.

20:01.768 --> 20:04.737
It was supposed to be a
surprise for our wedding.

20:04.771 --> 20:06.439
Well, you're just gonna
have to come up

20:06.473 --> 20:08.608
with something
even better.

20:08.641 --> 20:11.077
A challenge.

20:11.110 --> 20:13.112
I accept.

20:16.816 --> 20:18.718
So, next Saturday, do you want
to do the same thing?

20:18.751 --> 20:20.019
Go tech-free?

20:20.052 --> 20:22.389
Absolutely. We need
to not be distracted

20:22.422 --> 20:24.791
by our devices
and be present for our kid.

20:24.824 --> 20:27.627
I completely agree.

20:38.438 --> 20:40.440
(phone chimes)

20:42.241 --> 20:45.244
No, go get your own
glass of water.

20:54.821 --> 20:57.156
* Let's push the stroller,
just me and you *

20:57.189 --> 20:59.592
* You're my Dr. Davey

20:59.626 --> 21:01.461
* And I am your dude

21:01.494 --> 21:03.730
* We'll have ourselves
a family *

21:03.763 --> 21:06.132
* Our own little brood

21:06.165 --> 21:10.269
* Ah, ah, ah, ah... *

21:10.303 --> 21:13.773
* All we need's a test tube
and a handful of lube *

21:13.806 --> 21:16.175
* Life with you
will never be bad *

21:16.208 --> 21:18.645
* David Bartholomew Sawyer

21:18.678 --> 21:24.684
* You're my baby's dad...
