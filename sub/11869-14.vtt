Previously on Eureka...

00:02.753 --> 00:05.586
We're in space.
I've wanted to do
this my whole life.

00:05.714 --> 00:07.170
I mean, just
look out there.

00:07.883 --> 00:08.918
It's beautiful.

Hello, Allison.

00:19.228 --> 00:21.184
Astraeus mission update.

00:21.480 --> 00:25.064
Phase one is complete after
the initial 387 applicants

00:25.192 --> 00:28.184
presented their
best scientific ideas
for the six-month mission.

00:28.320 --> 00:30.481
Next.
Only the best of
the best were chosen

00:30.614 --> 00:31.820
to advance to the next stage.

00:31.949 --> 00:33.485
We're putting you
through to the next round.

00:33.617 --> 00:35.232
As the selection
process continues,

00:35.369 --> 00:38.111
the 120 candidates
now enter phase two,

00:40.249 --> 00:42.160
All departments throughout
Global Dynamics

00:42.292 --> 00:45.125
are working to make
the historic mission
to Titan a reality

00:45.254 --> 00:46.790
as we countdown to launch.

00:57.474 --> 00:58.759
(ALLISON SIGHING)

00:59.309 --> 01:02.301
Hey. So am I early
for coffee or are you late?

01:02.437 --> 01:04.428
No, it's me. I'm sorry.

01:04.565 --> 01:08.057
Work has been crazy since
physical training has started
for the Astraeus candidates.

01:08.193 --> 01:09.353
But honestly,
I just forgot.

01:09.486 --> 01:10.726
It's okay,
we still got time.

01:10.862 --> 01:13.069
No, unfortunately I don't.
I just got a shipment in,

01:13.198 --> 01:14.483
so now in addition
to the exams,

01:14.616 --> 01:16.607
l have to install
all this equipment.

01:16.785 --> 01:18.650
| get it. Maybe later?

01:18.829 --> 01:20.911
Yeah, I'm sorry.
But I still think
you're cute.

01:21.039 --> 01:24.122
All right. Oh, yeah?
I think you're cute.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.453
BOY: A little help, Sheriff?

01:34.219 --> 01:36.380
Thanks, Sheriff.
No problem.

01:37.222 --> 01:39.087
Morning, Jack.
Hey, Henry.

01:40.350 --> 01:41.465
Wow.

01:42.394 --> 01:44.806
Tune up and a hand wax.
That's what I call service.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.223
Jack, you ain't seen
nothing yet.

01:46.356 --> 01:48.392
l've extended
your remote entry and...

01:48.525 --> 01:50.061
Here hold this, will you?
Sure.

01:50.193 --> 01:52.935
Okay, guys,
can I borrow your bat?

01:53.071 --> 01:54.060
Sure.
Thanks.

01:55.032 --> 01:56.147
Whoa!

01:57.659 --> 01:59.695
Do you like it?
Yeah.

01:59.995 --> 02:03.408
l've hardened it with
a resilient, super-dense
protective coating.

02:04.416 --> 02:05.781
That's science
I can get behind.

02:05.917 --> 02:08.875
Actually I did it because
I was just tired of fixing it.
Well, fair enough.

02:09.004 --> 02:12.371
Listen, I've got to run
because candidate fitness
training starts today.

02:12.507 --> 02:14.919
Oh, in Eureka
that involves

02:15.052 --> 02:16.588
what, VR goggles
and video games?

02:16.720 --> 02:21.134
| wish. The instructor
has a reputation
for being merciless.

02:21.266 --> 02:22.221
(BLOWS WHISTLE)

02:22.351 --> 02:26.139
I said toes on the line,
you worthless bunch of PHDs!

02:26.271 --> 02:29.138
You are Group Alpha.
I will be attempting
to train you

02:29.274 --> 02:32.607
for the physical
fitness requirements
of the Astraeus project.

02:32.736 --> 02:36.320
This is my lab.
You want to go into space,

02:36.740 --> 02:39.527
on purpose, you've got
to go through me first.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.242
Who knows what a push-up is?

02:42.371 --> 02:45.033
Oh, I do. It's a
calisthenics exercise

02:45.165 --> 02:49.204
focusing on the pectoral
and tricep muscles
dating back to the Greco...

02:49.336 --> 02:51.122
I don't think
that's what she meant.

02:51.254 --> 02:53.791
Why don't you all show me
what a push-up is?

02:53.924 --> 02:55.880
Say, 50 times?

02:56.093 --> 02:57.253
Down on the ground!

02:59.179 --> 03:00.885
You're a botanist,
right?

03:01.473 --> 03:02.633
Kiss my grass!

03:02.766 --> 03:04.381
That's looking good,
Dr. Deacon.

03:04.518 --> 03:05.598
Thank you, Jo.

03:06.895 --> 03:08.476
Uh, Miss Lupo.

03:10.232 --> 03:12.974
Come on, Alphas!
Group Bravo says

03:13.110 --> 03:14.316
that you are the
sorriest collection

03:14.528 --> 03:17.065
of community college
rejects they've ever seen.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.028
You want to prove them right?

03:19.157 --> 03:21.569
What kind of mathematician
can't get 50?

03:22.577 --> 03:26.240
Forty-nine, 50.
Anything else,
Miss Lupo?

03:27.332 --> 03:30.244
Why, I say 50 more,
cupcake.

03:31.169 --> 03:32.545
Let's go people.

03:32.671 --> 03:36.334
Stop looking like
a bunch of little girls
in your panties! Go!

03:39.302 --> 03:42.465
Dr. Marten, l was
hoping to run into you
at Cafe Diem last night

03:42.597 --> 03:44.462
to go over the FTL
map integration specs.

03:44.599 --> 03:46.009
I'm sorry,
did we have plans?

03:46.143 --> 03:47.679
I ate someplace else
with someone else.

03:47.811 --> 03:49.642
Oh, uh, no, no. Here.

03:50.480 --> 03:55.349
Urn, maybe at some point
you might want to, you know,
look over stuff together?

03:55.652 --> 03:57.517
Sure, sure.
Have you seen this?

03:58.155 --> 03:59.440
I did just
give it to you.

03:59.656 --> 04:02.238
Once we establish
an outpost on Titan,
we'll have a base

04:02.367 --> 04:05.734
for space exploration
beyond our own galaxy.
Isn't that exciting?

04:05.954 --> 04:08.036
The most. So, uh,

04:08.165 --> 04:11.578
somebody else, is that like
a colleague or a completely
platonic friend?

04:12.711 --> 04:15.828
Just think, someone
will get to see things
we've only imagined

04:15.964 --> 04:18.171
through probe imagery
and spectroscopic data.

04:18.300 --> 04:20.165
Cryo-volcanoes,
methane lakes.

04:20.302 --> 04:22.133
Yeah, well, assuming
they live long enough.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.468
That guy hasn't
run for anything

04:23.597 --> 04:25.758
since our Warcraft guild
elected a new secretary.

04:26.558 --> 04:28.298
Well, I'm sure
you'll do fine.

04:28.435 --> 04:31.097
Your body mass index
indicates a healthy
level of fitness.

04:31.605 --> 04:32.845
Here you go.

04:33.148 --> 04:35.389
Uh, thank you? What...
What are these for?

04:35.859 --> 04:38.191
No one's guaranteed
a spot in the mission,
including us.

04:38.361 --> 04:40.226
What?
But I'm the head of G.D.!

04:40.781 --> 04:42.317
And a space veteran.

04:43.116 --> 04:44.105
I'm not sure
launching yourself

04:44.242 --> 04:47.200
into orbit and nearly
destroying the ISS
counts as experience.

04:47.329 --> 04:49.866
But don't worry.
You're not going
to be alone.

04:50.332 --> 04:51.788
See you out there, cadet.

04:57.172 --> 04:58.787
Hmm. Nice logo.

extremely sophisticated

05:03.053 --> 05:04.509

05:04.638 --> 05:06.594
Of course, Dr. Blake.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.094
Someone got new toys.

05:10.227 --> 05:12.764
Yes, thanks to
the Astraeus budget.

05:13.897 --> 05:15.933

05:16.274 --> 05:19.016
Apparently, we're
supposed to run everywhere.
One of Jo's commandments.

05:19.236 --> 05:22.399
Well, it's good to see you
leading by example.

05:23.240 --> 05:26.573
I'm sure it has nothing
to do with the fact that
Holly is in your group.

05:26.743 --> 05:29.530
Who Dr. Marten? She is?
I did not know that.

05:30.372 --> 05:31.987
Yeah, Fargo,
you better go change.

05:32.123 --> 05:33.909
NASA's here for
the astrobiology review.

05:34.292 --> 05:36.908
About that.
l was wondering if you
could handle that for me?

05:37.045 --> 05:38.125
Fargo, look around you.

05:38.255 --> 05:40.041
l have to handle
all the candidate physicals,

05:40.173 --> 05:44.041
not to mention
give the entire town
inoculations.

05:44.803 --> 05:46.668
And look,
they just brought more.

05:46.847 --> 05:49.338
lnoculations?
As in shots?

05:49.474 --> 05:51.931
As in our planetary
protection protocol.

05:52.060 --> 05:55.223
We can't risk introducing
a pathogen on this mission.
I'm just busy.

05:55.355 --> 05:56.891
Uh-huh. Read.

a new method for
chemosynthesis detection?

06:04.573 --> 06:06.404

to unpack themselves.

for you, Sheriff?

of my life, Vince.

they don't make
maple bars in space.

06:40.317 --> 06:41.352
Too true.

06:41.484 --> 06:43.975
My mom, she acts like
she's already in space.

06:44.112 --> 06:45.613
She cooked me
fried eggs this morning.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.104
She knows I only
eat scrambled.

06:47.240 --> 06:51.324
Well, your mom's got a lot
going on with the whole
Astraeus medical thing.

It's a quantum runaway
something or other.

Someone did what?

07:14.184 --> 07:15.549
I'll be right there.

happy about that?

No blob, no wormhole,
just a good old-fashioned
bank robbery.

You seem downright
perky, boss.
Yeah.

07:39.834 --> 07:41.210
We're going to
do fingerprints.

We're going to do
a tire impression.

to interview...

07:49.135 --> 07:50.466
Andy?
Yeah, boss?

07:52.347 --> 07:54.508
You said there was
a bank robbery.

07:54.641 --> 07:56.677
Yep, someone
stole it last night.

08:00.063 --> 08:01.223
Of course they did.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.199
Well, it didn't get
dragged off,
so where did it go?

08:22.335 --> 08:24.246
Good question.
Although
I am seeing

08:24.379 --> 08:27.121
bits of crystal lattice
decompression.

08:27.257 --> 08:28.497

08:28.633 --> 08:29.839
It's strange. I mean,

wouldn't leave

08:31.928 --> 08:33.964
this kind of
quantum signature.

08:34.305 --> 08:35.294
Huh.

08:36.182 --> 08:38.343
And why would
anybody steal a bank?

08:39.144 --> 08:41.100
Because that's where
they keep the money.

Electronically.
Exactly.

08:46.151 --> 08:48.893
So the bank only holds
safety deposit boxes.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.565
No money, just personal items.

08:50.697 --> 08:51.903

wanted to steal

something inside
the safety deposit boxes.

08:53.533 --> 08:56.024
Yeah, well, they went through
an awful lot of trouble.

08:56.161 --> 08:58.197
I mean, the bank is
reinforced with osmium.

08:58.329 --> 09:02.197
I mean, the vault is a solid
block of the stuff.

09:02.333 --> 09:06.076
It is the densest,
heaviest object in town.

09:06.212 --> 09:08.168

and walk off with it.

to mess with me?

help with your sprain.

10:52.235 --> 10:55.227
Love the new
nanoscale tomograph.

10:55.363 --> 10:59.197
Me, too. It's like
1000 times more
detailed than any MRI.

10:59.325 --> 11:01.156
Thank you, Astraeus.

11:03.204 --> 11:05.911
So I hear that Jo
has you running tires.

11:06.040 --> 11:08.167
And doing chin-ups.

11:08.293 --> 11:09.408
Those are the worst.

11:09.544 --> 11:12.377
I am a neuroscientist,
not GI. Jane.

11:13.381 --> 11:17.090
Oh, but Henry,
he is loving
every minute of it.

11:17.218 --> 11:18.924
Well, let's see how much
he's loving it

11:19.053 --> 11:20.884
when he comes in
for his physical today.

11:23.850 --> 11:26.683
Ah, look at this.
Good as new.
Thanks, Allison.

11:26.811 --> 11:32.147
Good. So, listen,
can I talk to you
for a second

11:32.275 --> 11:33.560
as a neuroscientist?

11:34.152 --> 11:35.608
Yeah, of course.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.108
When I was working
in here this morning,

11:41.367 --> 11:44.154
one moment,
I'm looking at
a stack of boxes,

11:44.287 --> 11:47.529
and the next,
they're completely unpacked.

11:48.208 --> 11:53.168
I mean dozens of vials
of vaccines mixed
and ready to administer.

11:55.381 --> 11:58.214
No, that's the strangest part.
I asked them and
they said that I did.

11:59.135 --> 12:01.797
Have you had any nausea
or shortness of breath?

12:01.930 --> 12:03.511
No, no I... I feel fine.

12:05.350 --> 12:10.265
My preliminary diagnosis
is you are an ovenNorked
mother of two.

12:11.064 --> 12:13.680
Typically, Iwould
prescribe a week in Fiji.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.274
But, um, let me run
some tests to be sure.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.982
Dr. Blake,
you're next exam's here.

12:20.114 --> 12:21.570
Okay, thank you.

12:21.783 --> 12:24.866
(SIGHING)
Well, I will do that
when I get a chance.

12:25.620 --> 12:27.030
Okay. Sure.
Thank you.

12:33.461 --> 12:37.079
(WHISTLING)
Let's go, Group Bravo!
Go, go, go!

12:37.215 --> 12:39.126
FARGO: You're not
even supposed to be
in this group, Parrish.

12:39.259 --> 12:42.126
I transferred.
Dr. Marten and I
discussed it during dinner.

12:42.262 --> 12:43.297
You ate with him?

12:43.429 --> 12:45.010
Yeah, then he showed me
his equipment.

12:45.139 --> 12:46.925
Whoa!
It was really something.

12:47.308 --> 12:50.721
Oh. My collection of antique
particle physics equipment
is unparalleled.

12:50.853 --> 12:51.979
Partner up!

12:52.105 --> 12:53.390
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Hey!

12:53.523 --> 12:56.731
Not now, Larry.
Get off the phone.
Don't make me say it again.

12:58.486 --> 13:00.522
Crunch time,
poindexters!

13:00.905 --> 13:02.315
After you, Doctor.

13:04.951 --> 13:07.909
Why don't I get to choose
my own partner?
I mean, I am the boss.

13:08.037 --> 13:09.823
Well, out here,
I'm the boss.

13:09.956 --> 13:12.288
Here. Jump rope, Suzy.

13:16.087 --> 13:17.952
So you guys
really went out?

13:18.089 --> 13:21.377
Isaac made samosas.
Did you know he lived
in India for a while?

13:21.509 --> 13:24.000
And the view
of Mount Eureka
was so pretty.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.877
We took a picnic up to
that little campground.

13:26.014 --> 13:27.720
You know, the one
by the observatory.

13:27.849 --> 13:30.090
Oh, yeah.
I hear there's a lot of
bloodsucking ticks up there.

13:30.393 --> 13:32.725
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
He hears a lot of things.

13:32.854 --> 13:36.142
What? No, no, I'm still
waiting for inventory
from six departments...

13:36.274 --> 13:41.143
Everybody thank Dr. Fargo
for the medicine ball drills
we are about to do.

13:41.279 --> 13:43.645
Set them for 10 pounds,
eggheads.

13:44.157 --> 13:47.194
Miss Lupo, Doug is
just doing hisjob.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.318
The things he's doing
are things that need doing.

13:50.455 --> 13:54.243
Do you want to set them to
20 pounds, Dr. Chatterbox?

13:55.043 --> 13:56.158
No.

13:57.295 --> 13:59.377
Way to keep your eye
on the ball, Doug.

13:59.672 --> 14:00.878
(SCREAMS)

14:06.012 --> 14:08.845
Great.
Perfect, brainiac!

14:11.267 --> 14:14.009
Sorry, Miss Lupo.
I guess I don't know
my own strength.

14:14.145 --> 14:16.807
All right, move it!
Get after him, go!

14:18.358 --> 14:20.440
We could put out
an APB.

14:20.568 --> 14:21.853
On a bank?

14:22.195 --> 14:24.811
That's not a conversation
I want to have with
Highway Patrol.

14:28.117 --> 14:31.985
See, look at this stuff.
I mean, you've got
someone's first slide rule.

14:32.121 --> 14:34.203
You got an antique
Higgs Field Disrupter.

14:35.291 --> 14:36.622
Mint condition Betamax.

14:38.419 --> 14:39.920
No one would want
to steal this stuff.

14:40.463 --> 14:42.169
The sentimental nature
of the items suggests

14:42.298 --> 14:43.834
perhaps the perp
will seek a ransom.

14:45.134 --> 14:47.876
Or he runs the most boring
museum in the world.

14:48.096 --> 14:49.757
Or flea market.
Don't say "perp."

14:49.889 --> 14:50.799
Okay.

14:50.932 --> 14:52.138
Sheriff Carter.
Yeah.

14:52.266 --> 14:54.803
My grandmother's heirlooms
were in the bank.

14:54.936 --> 14:58.679
Just tell us what you're
missing Dr. Boyle and
we will add it to the list.

14:59.565 --> 15:01.396
Let's see...
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

15:02.026 --> 15:03.266
Carter.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.235
Uh, what's that, Jo?
Fargo's where?

15:06.697 --> 15:09.234
Up a tree, kitten style.

15:13.162 --> 15:14.151
(FARGO WHIMPERING)

15:18.209 --> 15:21.042
Oh. Mommy.

15:21.796 --> 15:24.253

15:24.674 --> 15:26.505
All right,
I'll be right there.
There in a second.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.000
Grandma's gold
wedding band.
Her pearls.

15:29.137 --> 15:30.377
Mmm-hmm.

15:30.513 --> 15:32.049
Her antimatter.

15:32.181 --> 15:33.341
Anti matter?

15:33.808 --> 15:35.844
Dr. Boyle, I didn't know
the bank allowed

15:35.977 --> 15:37.592
proton collider
output material.

15:37.728 --> 15:39.389
It's an heirloom.

15:39.522 --> 15:41.433
And it's in
a Class Two static field,

15:41.566 --> 15:44.103
which should protect it
under most normal
circumstances.

15:44.235 --> 15:45.224
Oh, good.

15:45.987 --> 15:48.148
That's good why, Andy?

15:48.364 --> 15:51.197
Antimatter is
extremely volatile.

15:51.325 --> 15:52.576
One ounce can use
an explosive force

15:52.702 --> 15:55.284
equal to 1.22
megatons of TNT.

15:57.248 --> 16:02.163
So someone didn't steal
a bank, they stole a bomb.

16:09.010 --> 16:11.877
Grandmas are
supposed to make pie,
not antimatter.

16:14.098 --> 16:15.383
HENRY: Hey, Jack,
you're all set here.

16:15.516 --> 16:16.801
Oh, good.

16:17.226 --> 16:20.935
So the antimatter detector
tracks levels of
antiparticle energy,

16:21.063 --> 16:23.270
so the more it
beeps. Right.
The closer you get. Right.

16:23.691 --> 16:25.522
How's our baryonic asymmetry?

16:25.651 --> 16:26.936
Nominal.
Ah.

16:27.737 --> 16:30.979
Well, thank God,
becauseif
you know, there's...

16:31.532 --> 16:32.988
Yeah, I don't know
what that is.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.655
Dr. Boyle's antimatter
is most likely still
in the bank vault.

16:36.787 --> 16:39.199
So the detector
will lead us
right to the big bomb.

16:40.374 --> 16:44.413
Right. You know this case
was cool and old school
for like a minute.

16:45.171 --> 16:48.629
Oh, and Fargo's
stuck in a tree
if you could help out.

16:48.758 --> 16:49.918
Okay.
All right.

16:50.551 --> 16:53.759
Stuck in a tree?
I don't know. It's a...

16:53.888 --> 16:56.971

No GPS. I get it.

I have to map
the wake flow
path lines to be sure,

17:05.566 --> 17:08.057
but your airspeed
must have been
like 25 miles per hour.

17:08.194 --> 17:09.183
There you go.

17:09.654 --> 17:11.190
Hey, I think
you left your
dignity up there.

17:11.322 --> 17:12.528
Oh, I'll show you dignity.

17:12.657 --> 17:14.238
Calm down, Fargo.

17:15.284 --> 17:18.071
But it was sabotage.
He tampered with
the medicine ball.

I'm pressing charges.

17:26.462 --> 17:28.293
No, I didn't touch
the stupid medicine ball.

flunk both of you.

to go into space.

going to treat
the opportunity?

that ball and we'll see
what's what, huh?

You're never going to
qualify at this rate, Doug.

You can kiss that ticket
to Titan goodbye.

might be getting the best
of some people.

It's not a fight
to the death.

what Miss Lupo
has planned for later.

18:04.333 --> 18:05.789
Can't wait.

You may be
a little sore later.

I missed the Astraeus

18:31.319 --> 18:33.105
because I was busy
getting shot into a tree.

sweaty yoga because
I have a call with Washington.

is a big job and so is
being in Astraeus camp.

...Up with that?
That's an awesome idea.

What? Well, no.
That can't be made
from the "os" stuff.

Well, no, but it has
components
made of iridium

21:17.860 --> 21:20.772
which is a similar
density to osmium.

are being affected?

about my jeep?

21:49.141 --> 21:50.802
Maybe I just need
to take a break.

21:51.644 --> 21:53.305
Well, that's a first.
Yeah.

21:53.938 --> 21:57.305
Um, but right now
I need to speak with Henry,

21:57.441 --> 22:00.774
and you need to
take care of
the town, Sheriff.

22:00.903 --> 22:01.938
Sure.

22:11.539 --> 22:13.154
All done tormenting
physicists?

22:13.290 --> 22:15.372
Half my equipment
floated away.

22:15.501 --> 22:16.832
Training's been canceled
until we fix

22:16.961 --> 22:19.122
whatever gravity glitch
you geniuses have caused.

22:19.505 --> 22:20.995
We're heading back to G.D.

22:23.759 --> 22:26.125
Lead with the jab,
then the cross.

22:26.262 --> 22:28.503
Jab's the can opener,
the cross is the spoon.

22:32.935 --> 22:35.347
Hmm. I didn't know
you boxed, Lupo.

22:35.521 --> 22:39.059
Well, not since
flight school.
28 and 0, six by knockout.

22:39.817 --> 22:41.648
Knockout. I bet.

22:42.862 --> 22:45.194
Hey, Rocky.
Training is canceled.

22:45.447 --> 22:47.699
Unless you want a bank
to fall on your head.

22:51.078 --> 22:53.069
All this work to get
back into space.

22:53.205 --> 22:55.070
After what you and Fargo
went through,

22:55.207 --> 22:56.413
I didn't think
you'd want to.

22:56.709 --> 22:59.792
I didn't at first,
but then...

22:59.920 --> 23:01.831
What? I was 11 once.

23:03.340 --> 23:06.628
To be an astronaut.
Every kid's dream.

23:07.970 --> 23:09.301
Then you grow up.

23:09.430 --> 23:14.470
Hey, um, Zane. Look,
your criminal record
disqualifies you

23:14.602 --> 23:16.138
from being
in the Astraeus project.

23:16.270 --> 23:17.305
Yeah, I know.

23:17.438 --> 23:19.178
What? You...

23:22.568 --> 23:24.775
An hour? That's what
you came up with?

23:26.864 --> 23:27.649
Well... Okay, well,

23:27.781 --> 23:29.863
why are you putting
yourself through
all of this?

23:30.868 --> 23:32.574
I want them to see
what they're missing.

23:32.745 --> 23:35.031
They're going to tell me
I can't go? Screw them.

23:35.831 --> 23:36.911
DRIVER: Watch your step.

23:42.171 --> 23:43.160
Hmm.

23:43.380 --> 23:45.962
Okay, baby,
you go in here and play.

23:46.091 --> 23:47.797
Kevin, you okay?

23:47.927 --> 23:49.883
As soon as I beat
this level Iwill be.

23:50.346 --> 23:52.758
SARAH: There's an over-shield
behind the covenant outpost.

23:52.890 --> 23:54.926
Really? Thanks, SARAH.

23:55.392 --> 23:58.429
Where is my tablet?
Kevin, I'm going to go
to the car and look for it.

23:58.687 --> 23:59.893
Okay.

24:00.397 --> 24:02.729
(CAR HORN HONKING)
(GASPS)

24:11.992 --> 24:15.450
Hi. So I assume the lack
of massive explosion
means it's still up there.

24:15.579 --> 24:18.070
Yeah, but it seems
the bank is gaining altitude.

24:18.207 --> 24:19.367
We don't hear that
every day.

24:19.500 --> 24:22.458
At least I think it is.
Something's making our signals
bounce around like crazy.

24:22.586 --> 24:26.829
Well, we got a bulldozer.
A big-ass telescope,
and a turbine up there.

24:26.966 --> 24:29.252
You sure one of your
Zero-G space gizmos
isn't leaking?

24:29.385 --> 24:31.046
That's not how
Zero-G works.

24:31.178 --> 24:33.840
Well, not unless
you subscribe to the
theory of graviphotons,

24:33.973 --> 24:36.464
where the superpartner
of the graviton exerts
a repulsive force.

24:36.809 --> 24:38.515
(CHUCKLING)
Like Dr. Parrish.

24:41.230 --> 24:42.720
Hey, Henry. You okay?

24:42.856 --> 24:44.062
Yeah. Fine.

24:44.858 --> 24:49.568
Scanner shows that
gravity is operating normally.

24:50.781 --> 24:52.521
Well, we've got
a bunch of stuff
up in the air.

24:52.658 --> 24:54.194
How's that not gravity
being messed up?

24:55.619 --> 24:57.780
Because gravity
doesn't make
things heavy.

24:57.913 --> 25:00.495
The Higgs Field.
Uh, isn't that where the
Mariners hold spring training?

25:00.791 --> 25:02.827
No, that's in Peoria Stadium
in Arizona.

25:02.960 --> 25:06.293
The Higgs Field is the
pervasive universal field
that gives things mass.

25:06.422 --> 25:09.960
Objects lose mass,
they begin to float
when the field is disrupted.

25:11.135 --> 25:13.296
Like by a Higgs
Field Disrupter.

25:14.847 --> 25:16.883
There's one in
the safety deposit box
in that floating bank.

25:22.688 --> 25:25.225
There are 76 objects
aloft at last count.

25:25.649 --> 25:26.934
Whoa, it's getting
crowded up there.

25:27.067 --> 25:31.231
Yeah, the disrupter's
affecting gold, lead,
carbon compounds.

25:31.363 --> 25:33.149
At the rate the bank's
losing mass,

25:33.282 --> 25:35.739
by tonight
we'll have to call NASA
to make a withdrawal.

25:35.868 --> 25:39.907
The Higgs Field interacts
more strongly with dense,
heavy objects than light ones.

25:40.581 --> 25:42.913
Petro Gravity
Field Generators.

25:43.834 --> 25:45.870
They increase gravity
in a localized area.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.086
Thank. Oh, these are
in the smart house.

25:49.214 --> 25:50.795
Right. Full spectrum
shielding. Allison...

25:50.924 --> 25:52.380
(BEEPS)
(SCREAMING)

25:53.427 --> 25:55.338
It's adjustable!
(SCREAMING)

25:56.764 --> 25:58.720
There we go. Come on.
You all right?

25:58.849 --> 26:00.134
CARTER: Yeah. Fine.

26:01.226 --> 26:03.808
I didn't know
you were going to
turn it on. Sorry.

26:03.937 --> 26:06.314
You can deploy them
around town
until we figure out

26:06.440 --> 26:07.646
how to fix the Higgs Field.

26:10.319 --> 26:12.810
It's okay. It's okay.
(BABY CRYING)

26:13.781 --> 26:15.066
Mom, where were you?

26:15.199 --> 26:17.110
Oh, I'm so sorry.
You've been gone for hours.

26:17.284 --> 26:18.239
Hours?

26:18.368 --> 26:20.029
Yeah! SARAH and I called
your phone like 20 times

26:20.162 --> 26:21.197
and you didn't
answer the phone.

26:21.330 --> 26:22.615
We thought something
happened to you.

26:22.915 --> 26:24.121
I'm so sorry.

26:29.004 --> 26:31.416
Oh, baby.
I'm sorry, baby.

26:31.840 --> 26:35.674
I'm sorry, baby.
I know. Mama's sorry.

26:39.723 --> 26:41.759
You guys reading me?
FARGO: Yeah. Loud and clear.

26:41.892 --> 26:45.851
Okay, so the Higgs Field
will keep unraveling until
we turn the disrupter off.

26:45.979 --> 26:49.813
Objects with smaller
and smaller amounts of
dense material will lose mass.

26:49.942 --> 26:51.523
How much time do we have?

26:53.737 --> 26:55.602
I'm guessing not much.

26:58.909 --> 27:00.900
Guys, we're in trouble.

27:15.592 --> 27:17.128
We're out of Petros.
We've grounded Martha.

27:17.261 --> 27:19.422
Andy and Jo have organized
an evacuation into G.D.

27:19.555 --> 27:22.513
Oh, good. G.D.'s shielding
will protect it from
the field disrupters.

27:22.641 --> 27:23.630
For now.

27:23.767 --> 27:25.678
Yeah. How about
our flying bomb?

27:25.811 --> 27:28.518
Uh, 10,000 feet over
Tesla School and rising.

27:28.647 --> 27:31.605
All that redistributed matter
is what's been interfering
with our signals.

27:31.733 --> 27:33.314
So that's why
we couldn't find
the bank at first.

27:33.443 --> 27:34.523
Yeah, you know what,
I should check the weather.

27:34.653 --> 27:36.860
We may be looking
for our town in Idaho.

27:39.741 --> 27:40.730
Allison.

27:42.744 --> 27:43.733
Hey.

27:44.371 --> 27:47.113
What is it?
You okay? Kids okay?

27:47.249 --> 27:50.366
Yes, they're fine.
They're at the smart house
with a nanny.

27:51.503 --> 27:54.836
Good. What's going on?

27:55.674 --> 27:59.007
I don't know.
I'm losing time somehow.

27:59.428 --> 28:02.090
Pieces of my day
are just gone.

28:03.557 --> 28:04.592
Gone how?

28:04.725 --> 28:06.465
Well, one moment
I'm doing something

28:06.602 --> 28:08.433
and the next
I'm somewhere else.

28:09.688 --> 28:11.553
I left the kids alone
for hours today.

28:11.690 --> 28:13.226
What if something had
happened to them?

28:13.358 --> 28:14.814
Okay. Okay.

28:17.279 --> 28:19.065
You got to have
someone take a look
at this, okay?

28:19.198 --> 28:20.654
Grace ran some
tests on me.

28:20.782 --> 28:22.613
She couldn't find anything.
Well, then...

28:22.743 --> 28:25.610
Jack, I feel like
I'm losing myself.

28:28.373 --> 28:29.624
CARTER: Yeah...

28:29.750 --> 28:31.115
Hey.

28:32.169 --> 28:34.535
This looks really intense,
but I have to tell you,

28:34.671 --> 28:36.502
Jo found who owns
the Higgs Field Disrupter.

28:36.632 --> 28:37.542
Great.

28:37.674 --> 28:40.791
Go. Floating banks
come first.

28:42.262 --> 28:44.594
We're going to figure
this out, okay?

28:44.973 --> 28:48.056
We might even
get to use some of
your shiny new doctor toys.

28:55.317 --> 28:56.773
This way,
ladies and gentlemen.

28:56.902 --> 28:59.018
You heard Mr. Data,
no pushing.

28:59.154 --> 29:00.439
Stay calm.

29:00.572 --> 29:03.314
Oh, hey, Carter,
they're right here.
Right. Thanks.

29:03.575 --> 29:07.568
Parrish, you didn't mention
you had a collection
of doomsday devices.

29:07.704 --> 29:10.286
It's particle physics
equipment,
Sheriff Carter.

29:11.041 --> 29:12.326
See, I don't see
the difference.

29:12.459 --> 29:13.414
Of course you don't.

29:13.543 --> 29:17.252
It is a collectable,
one-of-a-kind
Higgs Field Disrupter.

29:17.381 --> 29:19.793
It's signed, although
the authenticity
of the signature...

29:19.925 --> 29:24.134
Hey! It disrupts
the Higgs Field!

29:24.388 --> 29:25.468
You should put it
someplace safe.

29:25.597 --> 29:27.758
Oh, you mean like in a bank?
Yeah, like...

29:28.934 --> 29:30.299
I see your point.

29:30.852 --> 29:32.843
So when did you make
the deposit?
Yesterday.

29:32.980 --> 29:35.471
Jack, it's an antique.
I mean it should
be completely inert.

29:35.607 --> 29:39.691
It will take a powerful source
of antiparticle energy
to jumpstart that.

29:43.323 --> 29:44.859
How about antimatter?

29:44.992 --> 29:46.903
Is that antiparticle-y
enough for you?

29:47.119 --> 29:48.529
Yes. That would do it.

29:49.579 --> 29:53.743
So, someone
has to go up there
and separate the device

29:53.875 --> 29:56.082
from the antimatter
that's powering it.

29:57.587 --> 29:59.088
Duty calls, Sheriff.

30:05.971 --> 30:07.507
Why is it always heights?

30:12.728 --> 30:13.717
All right.

30:13.854 --> 30:16.596
ELECTRONIC VOICE: Nanoscale
tomography analysis complete.

30:17.566 --> 30:21.400
Let's see what
we've got here.
Show me the crazy.

30:22.029 --> 30:24.862
Foreign bodies have been
detected throughout
the neo cortex.

30:27.200 --> 30:31.489
Clarify those aren't
tumors or lesions.

30:31.621 --> 30:33.998
Negative. The nanoparticles
are manmade,

30:34.124 --> 30:36.410
composed of
bio-conductive material.

30:38.628 --> 30:39.913
Neural implants.

30:49.473 --> 30:51.634
(GRUNTING)

31:03.695 --> 31:06.107
(SCREAMING)

31:13.372 --> 31:15.408
Couldn't there be a more
terrifying way to get up?

31:15.540 --> 31:19.158
No. I don't think so.
I'm in!

31:19.378 --> 31:20.743
HENRY: Good luck, Jack.

31:20.879 --> 31:22.665
(SCREAMING)

31:22.798 --> 31:23.787
Jack?

31:24.591 --> 31:27.754
CARTER: (GRUNTING)
I'm all right!

31:28.637 --> 31:30.628
HENRY: Good. Now get
yourself to the vault.

31:30.764 --> 31:33.255
That's where
the Higgs Field Disrupter is.

31:33.683 --> 31:36.641
(GRUNTING)

31:46.947 --> 31:49.438
Oh! Jack, be careful.
Now the building
may be unstable.

31:50.867 --> 31:53.028
Noted, unstable bank!

31:54.162 --> 31:55.698
But what bank isn't?

31:57.082 --> 32:00.745
At least there's no lines!
I'm at the vault!

32:03.588 --> 32:06.079
Itslocked.
How can it be locked?

32:06.216 --> 32:08.457
The closest electricity's
two miles straight down!

32:08.593 --> 32:10.174
It's got a redundant
power supply.

32:10.303 --> 32:11.463
Just put your hand
on the scanner.

32:11.596 --> 32:13.336
HOLLY: The DNA locks
have been recoded for you.

32:14.182 --> 32:16.047
G.D. has your
sputum on file.

32:16.685 --> 32:18.095
That's disgusting!

32:18.979 --> 32:21.265
HENRY: All right, Jack,
to deactivate the Disrupter,

32:21.398 --> 32:24.481
you need to separate it from
the antimatter by using
the Penning Trap.

32:24.609 --> 32:26.770
That's the box
we attached to your belt.

32:29.072 --> 32:31.779
Right! Ready for box numbers!

32:31.992 --> 32:34.608
361 and 362.

32:45.505 --> 32:47.120
361, 362.

32:50.385 --> 32:51.966
Do I have to lick
the lock?

32:52.262 --> 32:54.344
You can if you want,
but that would be weird.

32:54.473 --> 32:56.714
Someone put her
in front of a cartoon!

32:56.933 --> 32:59.515
Jack, the boxes
are opening now.

33:05.650 --> 33:06.639
(GROANING)

33:09.237 --> 33:13.731
Ah. Got a little glow-y
vial of liquid,

33:14.451 --> 33:15.987
doesn't seem to be
an on or off switch.

33:16.119 --> 33:19.077
Oh, oh, Jack...
Uh, don't panic,

33:19.706 --> 33:23.290
but that's not
the Disrupter.
That's the antimatter.

33:24.753 --> 33:26.914
Just put it carefully
in the Penning Trap.

33:28.924 --> 33:30.004
You mean the box?

33:30.342 --> 33:32.003
If you mean the box,
you say box!

33:32.135 --> 33:33.124
Put it in the box!

33:33.261 --> 33:34.922
Don't yell at me!

33:39.684 --> 33:41.185
Stupid Penning Trap!

33:43.647 --> 33:45.854
(BEEPING)

33:56.576 --> 33:58.988
Okay, what's next?

34:00.247 --> 34:02.613
Uh, check the Disrupter.

34:02.874 --> 34:05.365
Check... Right.

34:10.590 --> 34:11.579
(BLEEPING)

34:11.716 --> 34:13.547
Uh...

34:14.511 --> 34:16.172
Looks like it's powering off.

34:25.981 --> 34:27.266
It worked!

34:27.399 --> 34:29.560
Now the Higgs Field will
gradually re-stabilize.

34:29.693 --> 34:33.185
And all the affected
objects will slowly
regain their normal mass

34:33.321 --> 34:36.404
and come to earth
in a controlled descent.

34:41.413 --> 34:42.778
Guys?

34:42.914 --> 34:44.290
I'm going down!

34:47.794 --> 34:48.783
(GRUNTS)

34:52.424 --> 34:54.790
Should he be falling faster
than everything else?

34:55.385 --> 34:57.671
Should I what, now?

34:58.471 --> 34:59.426
Huh.

34:59.556 --> 35:00.636
What, "huh"?

35:00.765 --> 35:02.676
Looks like the bank
will return to normal mass

35:02.809 --> 35:04.470
long before
it hits the ground.

35:04.603 --> 35:05.968
I need to check my math.

35:06.896 --> 35:08.352
Yes, please!

35:20.035 --> 35:22.492
Guys, time is of the essence!

35:26.374 --> 35:28.205
All right, all right,
unlock the boxes!

35:28.335 --> 35:30.371
Maybe something here
can help me!

35:30.879 --> 35:32.744
Uh, done. All right,
so we generate

35:32.881 --> 35:35.748
a magnetic levitation field
using our super collider.

35:35.884 --> 35:36.919
That takes 10 minutes.

35:37.052 --> 35:38.462
I've got the inventory
list from Andy.

35:38.720 --> 35:42.383
There's got to be like
a giant airbag in here
or something!

35:44.309 --> 35:46.220
What about
an electromagnetic cushion?

35:46.353 --> 35:48.594
The bank is falling
way too fast.
The impact would pancake it.

35:48.730 --> 35:50.686
Yeah, fantastic!

35:51.274 --> 35:53.890
Thrust. Vertical piloting,

35:54.027 --> 35:56.234
it's how you land a jump jet
on an aircraft carrier.

35:56.363 --> 35:59.230
Of course. We could
counteract the downward
momentum of the bank

35:59.366 --> 36:00.606
with something pushing up.

36:01.284 --> 36:02.194
You want me to fly a bank?

36:02.327 --> 36:04.488
No, not fly, just land.

36:04.621 --> 36:08.205
With what?
Jack, you've got the
Higgs Field Disrupter.

36:08.333 --> 36:11.450
We can turn it back on,
but we need a focused burst.

36:12.212 --> 36:13.827
If there was a field
amplifier up there.

36:13.963 --> 36:16.375
Yeah, there is.
ljust got to find it
here somewhere.

36:16.508 --> 36:18.749
Hey, what does it look like?

36:18.885 --> 36:21.422
It's like a little...
It's not that
little. It's...

36:21.554 --> 36:23.340
Well, it's round-ish.

36:23.473 --> 36:27.182
Well, it's kind
of like a...
Yeah. Sort of.

36:27.352 --> 36:28.467
Today!

36:29.104 --> 36:31.470
It's small-ish.
You know basket-y.

36:32.399 --> 36:33.889
Like a broccoli steamer?

36:34.025 --> 36:35.731
Oh, I was going to say
parabolic antennae,

36:35.860 --> 36:37.145
but sure, that's okay.

36:37.278 --> 36:39.655
So point to the ground
and flip the switch.

36:39.823 --> 36:41.779
HENRY: And then,
Jack, very carefully,

36:41.908 --> 36:44.240
just for an instant,
open the box.

36:45.328 --> 36:46.443
Right.

36:49.749 --> 36:51.159
Here goes!

36:59.384 --> 37:01.170
CARTER: Whoa!

37:05.432 --> 37:08.890
Jeez. That's not what
a bank robbery means.

37:10.145 --> 37:11.476
Just so you know.

37:15.567 --> 37:16.556
(HONNNG)

37:22.365 --> 37:25.198
Sorry, Sheriff,
the bank was the epicenter
of the disruption.

37:25.326 --> 37:27.533
We didn't account for
its accelerated
mass recovery.

37:27.662 --> 37:29.573
Got you.
So we're all good?

37:29.998 --> 37:32.114
Good? That was awesome.

37:32.250 --> 37:34.366
Yeah. Yeah, Awesome.

37:35.837 --> 37:37.953
Clean-up's undenNay.
We'll get the
Maglev crew here

37:38.089 --> 37:40.296
once they're done
hauling Archimedes
out of a corn field.

37:40.759 --> 37:42.465
Did everything
make it down okay?

37:42.594 --> 37:45.836
Uh. Mostly.
One or two things
escaped the EM shield

37:45.972 --> 37:47.473
before we set it
to contain the floaters.

37:49.476 --> 37:50.636
Where's my jeep?

37:59.611 --> 38:05.197
(GRUNTING) Four. Five.

38:07.494 --> 38:09.405
Fifteen.

38:09.537 --> 38:10.526
(LAUGHS)

38:11.372 --> 38:12.987
Oh, come on.

38:13.291 --> 38:15.077
Good for you.

38:15.210 --> 38:19.374
You know, whatever
crazy test is next,
I'm ready for it.

38:20.423 --> 38:22.584
Come here.
I want to talk to you.

38:28.473 --> 38:30.680
Henry, what's...
What's wrong?

38:31.351 --> 38:35.515
Allison's new scanner
has found something
in my heart.

38:35.939 --> 38:37.725
An atrial septal defect.

38:37.857 --> 38:41.395
Now I'm fine as long
as I'm here on Earth.

38:41.528 --> 38:43.314
But because of Titan's

38:43.446 --> 38:45.903
unusual pressure
and gravity,

38:46.032 --> 38:48.990
I'm cut from
mission selection.

38:50.203 --> 38:52.159
But I want you to go.

38:53.331 --> 38:54.537
Oh, I'm going.

38:55.416 --> 38:57.873
A little hesitation
would have been nice.

38:58.253 --> 39:00.369
And you're coming with me.

39:00.755 --> 39:03.872
Grace...
Henry, this is Eureka.

39:04.008 --> 39:06.545
We solve the impossible
every day.

39:06.678 --> 39:08.418
We will find a way
to help you.

39:09.514 --> 39:10.799
(CHUCKLES)

39:25.238 --> 39:26.227
Dr. Parrish,

39:26.364 --> 39:30.778
your equipment's
a lot smaller than you
made it out to be.

39:31.077 --> 39:33.113
Oh, my Disrupter.

39:33.454 --> 39:36.366
Holly, I'd like to
take you up on that
workout offer a little later.

39:36.499 --> 39:38.740
I've got time and
gear's not floating
off everywhere.

39:38.877 --> 39:40.287
Yeah, great. Yes, oh,

39:40.420 --> 39:43.162
I have determined that
basketball provides
the optimal mix of

39:43.298 --> 39:45.414
cardio respiratory
and muscular fitness.

39:46.050 --> 39:47.130
I like to dribble.

39:47.260 --> 39:49.125
That sounds like
a lot of fun.
I'll get my high tops.

39:49.262 --> 39:52.095
Uh, Dr. Parrish,
I need you to pull
inventory reports

39:52.223 --> 39:53.884
for your department
right now.

39:54.893 --> 39:58.181
Mmm. I see what
you're doing, Doug.

39:58.313 --> 40:00.599
"Dr. Fargo."
Out here I'm the boss.

40:00.732 --> 40:03.439
At least for now.
Inventory reports.

40:05.570 --> 40:07.151
Mmm.

40:09.240 --> 40:10.229
Excuse me.

40:11.451 --> 40:13.908
Ooh. Don't forget
your little thingy.

40:17.874 --> 40:21.458
So, basketball.
I have been known
to slam dunks.

40:21.586 --> 40:22.792
HOLLY: Oh, great.

40:28.426 --> 40:29.711
What's this?

40:29.844 --> 40:31.345
Orbital dynamics.

40:31.930 --> 40:33.966
Being an astronaut
is every kid's dream.

40:35.016 --> 40:36.005
I listen...

40:38.478 --> 40:42.096
Me join the Astraeus
mission? No.

40:42.482 --> 40:44.347
Why not? Right stuff.

40:48.446 --> 40:51.859
Because I am
not smart enough.

40:53.368 --> 40:56.360
I heard you saved
Carter's bacon today
with science.

40:56.788 --> 40:58.449
You're plenty smart.

40:58.790 --> 41:01.497
The eccentric anomaly
is the can opener.

41:02.543 --> 41:04.534
And Keppler's equation
is the spoon.

41:04.671 --> 41:05.626
Zane.

41:05.755 --> 41:08.337
I'm a felon.
You're a grunt with a gun.

41:08.466 --> 41:10.548
How about we screw
some expectations, huh?

41:13.388 --> 41:14.377
What?

41:14.931 --> 41:19.220
We, um, never talked
like this before.

41:20.269 --> 41:24.512
True. Our conversations
usually end with you
reading me my rights.

41:26.985 --> 41:28.350
That's not what I mean.

41:28.486 --> 41:31.273
Me and the other you.

41:31.948 --> 41:34.906
We sort of skipped past
the being friends part.

41:36.077 --> 41:38.238
Oh. Is that what
we're doing here?

41:38.746 --> 41:40.907
I just thought my life
would be a lot simpler

41:41.040 --> 41:42.496
if you were on
another planet.

41:45.837 --> 41:49.671
Now drop and give me
50 harmonic
oscillations, cupcake.

41:50.758 --> 41:52.623
"Cupcake." Cute.

41:52.760 --> 41:53.749
Mmm-hmm.

41:54.095 --> 41:55.130
All right.

41:55.263 --> 41:56.252
Start over here.

42:05.064 --> 42:06.019
Hi.

42:06.149 --> 42:07.138
Hey.

42:08.317 --> 42:10.103
So you solved
your bank robbery?

42:10.820 --> 42:15.564
Yeah. Turns out
the only person
who broke in was me.

42:15.700 --> 42:16.906
(CHUCKLES)

42:17.535 --> 42:21.278
I looked for you
at the infirmary.

42:21.414 --> 42:23.951
But they said you
ran some sort of

42:24.083 --> 42:26.039
unpronounceable
scan on yourself.

42:26.169 --> 42:30.378
Oh, nanoscale tomography,
it's a hyper-detailed
medical imagery.

42:33.217 --> 42:35.378
And? What'd you find?

42:38.890 --> 42:41.757
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

42:43.394 --> 42:45.601
Maintaining connection
at full signal strength.

42:45.730 --> 42:48.893
There's no more interference
from the Higgs Field
Disruption, Miss Barlowe.

42:49.567 --> 42:51.899
CARTER: So what do you
think it is? Just stress?

42:52.028 --> 42:54.986
Yes, I... I don't know
what came over me.

42:55.114 --> 42:56.274
It's just...

42:56.407 --> 42:57.817
Work's been crazy.

42:58.326 --> 43:00.817
But I am feeling
much better now, Jack.

43:03.372 --> 43:04.623
Good.

43:07.460 --> 43:08.540
Good.
