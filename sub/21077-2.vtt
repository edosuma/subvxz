00:01.899 --> 00:03.732
Damn, I'm sick
of sitting down in The Pit

00:03.734 --> 00:05.133
with the Urkels
and Section Eights.

00:05.135 --> 00:06.435
This ain't no place for a legend.

00:06.437 --> 00:09.504
Yeah, we ain't gon' get
no "vajayjay Abrams"

00:09.506 --> 00:11.706
sittin' next to fly guy.

00:13.177 --> 00:15.277
Speaking of getting no "vajayjay,"
where's Milk?

00:15.279 --> 00:18.180
<i>Don't you ever grab my pussy again!</i>

00:18.182 --> 00:19.988
Here come
Machine Gun Smelly.

00:20.023 --> 00:22.751
Our president said it was okay,
so mind your business.

00:22.753 --> 00:24.454
Man, white girls got
too much carbon.

00:24.489 --> 00:26.688
I gotta find me
a righteous Hotep ho

00:26.690 --> 00:28.190
with them brown nipples.

00:32.429 --> 00:33.895
A'pos'trafee'a?

00:33.897 --> 00:36.898
From now on, my name is
Queen La'pos'trafee'a.

00:36.900 --> 00:39.671
I have discovered
my African roots on Black Twitter.

00:39.706 --> 00:41.837
I am inviting you Nubian kings

00:41.839 --> 00:43.839
to my first annual Nat Turn Up.

00:43.841 --> 00:46.541
So please come, Grover and Jamal.

00:46.543 --> 00:48.176
Uh-uh, not you, Paul Wall.

00:48.178 --> 00:50.278
But I'm more nig
than all you nigs.

00:50.280 --> 00:51.680
Ah! Ah! Ah!

00:51.682 --> 00:54.467
Ah! Damn!
Ever since Trump got elected,

00:54.468 --> 00:55.784
y'all been taking extra slaps.

00:55.786 --> 00:58.253
Uh, Milk, my turn up is for uplifting

00:58.255 --> 01:01.857
the black experience and you,
my melanin starved brother,

01:01.859 --> 01:04.825
are as my grandmother would
proudly say, a honky.

01:04.828 --> 01:06.094
I don't know what that mean,

01:06.096 --> 01:09.664
- but if I don't go, they don't go.
- Shit, I'll be there.

01:09.666 --> 01:12.601
Sorry, Milk,
this party only for black.

01:12.603 --> 01:15.837

01:20.911 --> 01:22.812
A'pos'trafee'a's
parties are legendary.

01:22.847 --> 01:25.647
And nothing makes a "vagiggle"
wriggle like rosé,

01:25.649 --> 01:27.682
trap music, and Swahili.

01:27.684 --> 01:29.284
How she gon' invite you two
and not me?

01:29.286 --> 01:30.952
I'm the "gangsterest" one
in here.

01:30.954 --> 01:33.655
You sure are,
my little Nipsey Hustle.

01:33.657 --> 01:36.625
Ain't nobody ask you, Moms,
but you goddamn right.

01:43.767 --> 01:46.334
Whoo! 
Black guys!

01:52.109 --> 01:55.443
I'm not in the mood.
I'm going through some "thangs."

01:57.948 --> 01:59.881
<i>Are you feeling pasty and pale?</i>

01:59.883 --> 02:03.474
<i>Unathletic and small meated?</i>

02:09.477 --> 02:10.225
<i>Without getting [bleep] up?</i>

02:10.227 --> 02:15.762
<i>Are your black friends invited
to Nat Turn Ups without you?</i>

02:15.797 --> 02:19.200
<i>Well, then, hail a cab

02:19.235 --> 02:23.761

Rachel Dolezal Tanning Salon!</i>

02:31.848 --> 02:34.349
I know exactly why you're here.

02:34.351 --> 02:37.586
Hi, I'm Shoshana,
your certified melanologist.

02:37.588 --> 02:38.520
How'd you find out about us?

02:38.522 --> 02:41.923
Yelp, Snapchat,
or Kardashian sex tape?

02:41.925 --> 02:44.603
Man, [bleep] all that.
Just show me to the black beds.

02:44.638 --> 02:46.928
Okay, super serious question.

02:46.930 --> 02:49.331
How often do you wanna be
stopped and frisked?

02:49.333 --> 02:50.999
A lot.
A whole lot.

02:52.970 --> 02:54.502
Slow down, Macklemore.

02:54.504 --> 02:57.439
Straight to Akon requires
a manager's approval.

02:57.441 --> 02:59.841
There's paper work,
it's this whole process.

02:59.843 --> 03:03.044
Let's just get you started
with a nice golden Chris Brown.

03:03.046 --> 03:04.913
It's our biggest hit.

03:04.915 --> 03:07.898
Hell "jeah," I finally get to fix
God's mistake.

03:12.556 --> 03:16.291
Welcome, my kemetic Hoteps
of the Black Twitterverse.

03:16.293 --> 03:19.127
What's this for? I didn't
leave my wallet in El Segundo.

03:19.129 --> 03:23.106
Oh, one cannot twerk
in the uniform of the oppressor.

03:23.141 --> 03:27.335
Instead, we will shake our asses
in the robes of glory.

03:27.337 --> 03:29.170
I ain't wearing
this Kunta Kinte cloth.

03:29.172 --> 03:32.741
- This shit ain't league.
- Yeah, I think mine got AIDS.

03:32.743 --> 03:36.344
- Hey, Grover.
- Wait up, my empowered sista.

03:36.346 --> 03:38.480

That buffet is on point!

04:02.906 --> 04:04.839
They got
"Bernie Mac and Cheese,"

04:04.841 --> 04:06.091
"Tri-tip Called Quest,"

04:06.092 --> 04:07.342
"Keisha Coleslaw,"

04:07.344 --> 04:10.645
and for desert,
"Cuba Pudding Junior."

04:10.647 --> 04:14.749
Hey, it's kinda boring,
but somehow it works.

04:14.751 --> 04:16.351
This Hotep party is not the wave.

04:16.353 --> 04:18.687
They should call it
a "no-tep" party, my nig.

04:18.689 --> 04:22.957
Yeah, the "itis" is setting in.
This janky-ass party need a kicker.

04:24.127 --> 04:27.529
What's crackin', my ni-i-igs?

04:27.531 --> 04:30.365
- Milk, is that you?
- It's Chocolate Milk, homey,

04:30.367 --> 04:32.834
and thanks to the Rachel Dolezal
Tanning Salon,

04:32.836 --> 04:35.012
I'm "black-ish," my nigs.

04:35.806 --> 04:38.373
Part of me wants to smack him.
The other wants to dap him.

04:38.375 --> 04:40.608
- Bars.
- Well, while you contemplating,

04:40.610 --> 04:42.577
let's get this shit lit.

04:57.861 --> 04:59.594
Aye, homey, no reniggin'.

05:01.198 --> 05:04.199
He got me!
Deep burn.

05:04.201 --> 05:06.334
Damn, my nig,
hangin' with the brown boy

05:06.336 --> 05:09.520
formerly known as white could
get us nuts deep in black booty.

05:09.555 --> 05:12.974
Yeah, we might even get
some of his after-skeets.

05:12.976 --> 05:15.018
Hey, you trying to cuddle
with this puddle

05:15.053 --> 05:18.213
- and, uh, touch taste buds?
- [bleep] off. I'm trying to get

05:18.215 --> 05:20.415
dicked down
by this butterscotch brownie.

05:20.417 --> 05:22.951
Oh! That's our nig!
You wanna meet him?

05:22.953 --> 05:25.754
'Cause uh... maybe we can
arrange something.

05:25.756 --> 05:27.922
Maybe a little "tit for dat?"

05:27.924 --> 05:30.158
Oh, shit, you shoulda led with that.

05:30.160 --> 05:33.155
- I jumped on the grenade last time.
- Mm-mm.

05:33.190 --> 05:35.196
Ho, but I [bleep]ed
Dellavedova bareback

05:35.198 --> 05:37.291
and he wasn't even starting, bitch.

05:37.326 --> 05:39.534
Hello, can somebody
make a decision please?

05:39.536 --> 05:41.438
[bleep] it.
Let's just flip for it.

05:42.123 --> 05:45.039
- Yass!
- Oh, [bleep].

05:45.041 --> 05:48.009
<i>Mmm.</i>

05:48.011 --> 05:50.445
Hey, quit hogging the stink, Jamal.

05:50.447 --> 05:53.348
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

05:54.384 --> 05:57.552
- Hey, Milk. You better call me.
- Okay.

05:57.554 --> 06:00.255
Hey, that party was lit,
but you know

06:00.257 --> 06:02.557
it ain't no fun
if your homeys don't get none.

06:02.559 --> 06:05.260
Funny, the homeys is
the only ones that say that.

06:05.262 --> 06:06.861
Yo, you gon' play us like that?

06:06.863 --> 06:09.197
Y'all know the drill.
I keep the nines and dimes.

06:09.199 --> 06:11.518
Y'all can have
my soft sixes and sevens,

06:11.553 --> 06:13.835
but I get all them Caribbeans.
"Non-negrotiable."

06:13.837 --> 06:16.571
Maybe your "light-skindedness"
can help me get Cindy.

06:16.573 --> 06:18.424
Whatever you need.
What up, my nig?

06:18.425 --> 06:20.642
Look, I don't care
what transition you go through,

06:20.644 --> 06:23.945
you still can't be saying "nig" to me.
You always gon' be white Milk.

06:23.947 --> 06:26.040
Nah, it's Chocolate Milk, homey,

06:26.075 --> 06:29.294
'cause I got that Nestlé Quik dick.
Stay black.

06:29.719 --> 06:31.794
See, this another thing
I been talking about.

06:31.829 --> 06:32.821
White appropriation.

06:32.823 --> 06:35.223
They take our fashion,
our music, our culture.

06:35.225 --> 06:36.968
Why don't they take something
black people don't want?

06:37.003 --> 06:39.294
Like diabetes, sickle cell,
Omarosa,

06:39.296 --> 06:42.186
OJ, the electoral college,
swimming pools,

06:42.221 --> 06:45.667
- police beatings, the City of Atlanta.
- Talking during the movie.

06:45.669 --> 06:48.556
- Black female customers.
- Hey, mother[bleep]s, I do the rants!

06:48.591 --> 06:49.571
<i>Sorry, boss.</i>

06:49.573 --> 06:52.047
Now, where was I?
Oh, yeah, Charles Barkley...

06:53.599 --> 06:54.598
What's up, Chocolate Milk?

06:54.600 --> 06:57.067
I want you to give me
that Vitamin D, Milk.

06:57.069 --> 06:58.368
Hey, it's Chocolate Milk

06:58.370 --> 07:01.738
and the bros that aren't
Chocolate Milk.

07:01.740 --> 07:05.342
You hear that?
They talking about us.

07:05.344 --> 07:07.878
Hey, there go Cindy. Now, put
your high yellow magic to work

07:07.880 --> 07:10.174
and help make Cindy's pants
disappear.

07:11.083 --> 07:13.780
Hey, Cindy, I was wondering
if you'd go out with a nig?

07:13.815 --> 07:15.285
Yeah, I'll go out with you.

07:15.287 --> 07:17.821
What the [bleep]?
Cindy, what about my dick?

07:17.823 --> 07:20.557
Shut up, nigga!
Don't mess this up for me.

07:20.559 --> 07:22.092
Okay, then.

07:22.094 --> 07:24.061
Uh, did I just overhear
you going out with Cindy?

07:24.063 --> 07:26.196
You promised we could
hang out tonight.

07:26.198 --> 07:28.031
Don't worry, baby,
there's enough Nutella

07:28.033 --> 07:30.716
to spread on both them cheeks.
Hit me later.

07:30.751 --> 07:32.970
I gots to go put some
primpin' in my pimpin'.

07:32.972 --> 07:35.728
I'll see you two crotch goblins
at the Blue Crab.

07:35.729 --> 07:37.941
- Oh!
- Don't be late.

07:37.943 --> 07:39.776
You trying to knock down Cindy
and A'pos'trafee'a?

07:39.778 --> 07:41.278
Man, you being a ball hog.

07:41.280 --> 07:44.168
Why would I pass when I got
this big, black mamba, my nig?

07:44.203 --> 07:45.349
Kobe!

07:45.351 --> 07:47.687
Ah! What you do that for?
I can say it now.

07:47.722 --> 07:50.320
That one's for not being my nig
and mentioning Kobe.

07:50.322 --> 07:52.055
Look, we're finally black brothers.

07:52.057 --> 07:53.390
We ain't supposed to be beefing.

07:53.392 --> 07:55.159
You know I ain't trying
to smash Cindy.

07:55.161 --> 07:56.960
But I am "finna" see
what that mouth do.

07:56.962 --> 07:59.296
- Ooh!
- I never liked you anyway,

07:59.298 --> 08:00.998
you pretty, beige mother[bleep]!

08:01.000 --> 08:03.445
Oh, you gon' let him do that, Grove?
You're the one who...

08:04.670 --> 08:05.969
All right, all right, that's enough.

08:05.971 --> 08:07.437
What's y'all problem?
You been actin'

08:07.439 --> 08:10.240

08:10.242 --> 08:13.443
Milk, bro. Brody. Honky.
You're white.

08:13.445 --> 08:15.913
Hey, we can't choose the skin we in.

08:15.915 --> 08:17.814
That's exactly what you did.

08:17.816 --> 08:19.383
You need to get off your own dick.

08:19.385 --> 08:21.416
Hey, you right.
I got Cindy for that.

08:21.451 --> 08:23.053
I should [bleep] him up.

08:23.055 --> 08:25.956
I don't know, my nig.
He can probably fight now.

08:30.763 --> 08:32.596
Loosen up!
We gotta win this thing,

08:32.597 --> 08:34.431
so I'm putting you in the game,
mother[bleep]!

08:34.433 --> 08:36.500
- Oh, yeah, man, let's go!
- About time Coach Bundy stopped trippin'!

08:36.501 --> 08:38.702
- Aw, hell yeah.
- Nobody's talking to you two brownies!

08:38.703 --> 08:41.429
I'm talking to this handsome,
Klay Thompson-lookin' mother[bleep].

08:41.464 --> 08:42.405
- Wha...
- Whaaat?

08:42.408 --> 08:44.608
Everybody knows if it
ain't light, it ain't right!

08:44.610 --> 08:48.212
And it damn sure ain't getting
in the game tonight! Bars!

10:07.326 --> 10:09.393
<i>I hereby demand</i>

10:09.395 --> 10:11.595
<i>the white cracker devil
stop perpetrating his fraud</i>

10:11.597 --> 10:14.431
<i>and go back to the caves
from whence he came!</i>

10:14.433 --> 10:15.499
Now, if you'll just sign here.

10:15.501 --> 10:17.768
Man, I'm sick
of "dark-skinded" nigs.

10:17.770 --> 10:20.437
Y'all been brainwashed by
BET and liberal white women.

10:20.439 --> 10:23.274
You think you entitled to some shit
just 'cause you sub-Saharan,

10:23.309 --> 10:25.475
then you hate on a nig that's
actually trying to achieve?

10:25.477 --> 10:27.611
You're achieving because
you pass the paper bag test.

10:27.613 --> 10:29.479
White guilt makes folks
overcompensate,

10:29.481 --> 10:31.014
but only on light-skinned blacks.

10:31.016 --> 10:33.784
You're a shade closer to them
and therefore more palatable.

10:33.786 --> 10:36.153
I think all y'all just mad
'cause my black life

10:36.155 --> 10:38.155
matters more than yours.
Now if you'll excuse me,

10:38.157 --> 10:40.740
I'ma go to the tanning salon
and hit these palms.

10:40.775 --> 10:43.988
So, Milk wants to be black, huh?

10:54.640 --> 10:56.473
Nah, he gon' learn today.

11:11.724 --> 11:14.157
What you screaming at?

11:14.159 --> 11:16.526
Aww, hell "jeah!"

11:16.528 --> 11:19.196
Shoshana, you are so fired!

11:19.198 --> 11:21.098
Alert the authorities.

11:21.100 --> 11:23.667
Aww, [bleep] "jeah!"

11:28.173 --> 11:29.740
Aw, damn.

11:53.565 --> 11:56.099
It's not personal.
I'm just a little scared.

11:57.102 --> 11:59.703
<i>How could you miss
cram school, Jae Kim?</i>

11:59.705 --> 12:01.171
What were you doing?

12:01.173 --> 12:03.407
I'm sorry, Father.
I was hanging out with Malik.

12:03.409 --> 12:06.777
How many times have I told you
not to associate with that ni...

12:06.779 --> 12:08.645
Oh! A customer!

12:08.647 --> 12:11.314
I'm sorry, we are out of Swishers.

12:11.316 --> 12:14.184
- I ain't here for no Swishers.
- Then we closed.

12:14.186 --> 12:15.619
But the sign say you open.

12:15.621 --> 12:18.455
Asian closed look
very similar to American open.

12:18.457 --> 12:19.456
It all about how you look at it.

12:19.458 --> 12:24.961
We close for... Asian Holiday.
Jae Kim, streamers!

12:27.299 --> 12:30.834
Man, whatever.
Y'all do you and I'ma do me.

12:39.778 --> 12:42.112
You buy and go!

12:42.114 --> 12:44.247
I feel sorry for your mother.

12:44.249 --> 12:45.649
Hey, what's wrong, Draymond?

12:45.651 --> 12:47.484
Hey, lately folks been acting different.

12:47.486 --> 12:48.585
Let me guess, they're
trippin', and you went

12:48.587 --> 12:51.555
from first class jackass
to second class citizen.

12:51.557 --> 12:53.634
- Jeah!
- Hey, that's the black trap, man.

12:53.669 --> 12:55.592
When the lights get dimmer,
people get scared.

12:55.594 --> 12:57.737
That ain't cool.
Shit starting to piss me off.

12:57.772 --> 12:59.797
- What am I supposed to do?
- Do what every black man does

12:59.798 --> 13:02.599
when he runs out of options...
go get a job at the airport,

13:02.601 --> 13:04.768
or move in with a white woman,
or open up a barbershop.

13:15.614 --> 13:17.180
<i>Hands up, asshole!</i>

13:17.182 --> 13:18.548
Oh, what up, Neal and Jamie?

13:18.550 --> 13:20.684
I don't need a ride along,
but appreciate you.

13:20.686 --> 13:22.452
Shut up, Draymond.
Up against the wall.

13:22.454 --> 13:24.151
Where are you going
in that gang attire?!

13:24.186 --> 13:26.111
Gang attire?
You mean this hoodie?

13:26.146 --> 13:27.424
I don't care what
you and your homeboys

13:27.426 --> 13:29.793
call it in the trap house.
I said...

13:29.795 --> 13:31.261
Skeetles!
Skeetles!

13:31.263 --> 13:32.295
Code Eggplant!

13:38.470 --> 13:40.767
This some ol' bullshit.

13:43.648 --> 13:45.488
Hey, what's up,
my "Thicky" Minaj a trois?

13:45.636 --> 13:47.283
Sorry I'm late.

13:47.285 --> 13:49.318
Eww. Why you look like
you been in a fire?

13:49.320 --> 13:50.119
Hmm.
More like two fires.

13:50.271 --> 13:53.372
Ain't no thang, baby,
just a little mishap at the dermo.

13:53.374 --> 13:55.808
I'm still black like me, though.
Let's just order.

13:58.612 --> 14:02.098
Uh-uh, nope, I can't do this.
He's just too black.

14:02.099 --> 14:05.517
- I done lost my appetite.
- Eww, he remind me of Harambe.

14:05.519 --> 14:07.886
Now I'm just sad.
Ooh, I can't eat either.

14:07.888 --> 14:10.623
Oh, so now y'all gon'
segregate this nine?

14:12.453 --> 14:14.520
Mama, hope you made some grits
and hot links for dinner.

14:14.522 --> 14:17.656
Hey, don't hurt me!
Here, take my wife!

14:17.658 --> 14:21.226
Oh, yeah, take me.

14:21.228 --> 14:23.470
Whoa! Come on, Ma.
It's me.

14:23.505 --> 14:24.763
- Milton?
- Milky?

14:24.765 --> 14:27.499
Well, now I guess I'll
never know who his dad is.

14:27.534 --> 14:28.901
Wait, he's black now?

14:28.903 --> 14:30.969
We didn't have a family
meeting about this.

14:30.971 --> 14:33.238
The Yeezys alone will bankrupt us.

14:33.240 --> 14:36.041
Nope, uh-uh, not happening.
This is my limit.

14:36.043 --> 14:38.710
It's either me or the dark side.

14:38.712 --> 14:41.713
Cool, may the Force be
with you, buster-ass Uncle Joey.

14:41.715 --> 14:45.284
- Maybe you should go, Milk.
- Ma, is you serious?

14:47.655 --> 14:49.021
[bleep] y'all then.

14:49.023 --> 14:53.292
Oh, my son's blackness
made me a little moist.

14:53.294 --> 14:55.727
Let's not waste it.

14:57.796 --> 15:01.011
Damn, Exxon "Val-deez" nuts.
What happened to you?

15:01.046 --> 15:02.699
My blackness got me
kicked out the house.

15:02.701 --> 15:04.768
I had to sleep
on Afrika Bambaataa's couch,

15:04.770 --> 15:05.936
which is on his porch.

15:05.938 --> 15:07.704
Well, congrats on being black,
my nigga.

15:07.706 --> 15:11.275
I think I smell gout.
You made it.

15:11.277 --> 15:13.010
Uh, thank you?

15:13.012 --> 15:15.868
Hey, Jamal, how many combs
you go through a week?

15:15.903 --> 15:18.649
None, my nig.
I got Indian in my family.

15:18.651 --> 15:20.751
7-Eleven, not casino.

15:20.753 --> 15:24.454
Damn, you lucky.
Y'all still some haters, though.

15:24.456 --> 15:27.648
I bet when he wash his hair,
his scalp don't get wet.

15:29.028 --> 15:32.663
Starting five, get your
mother[bleep]ing asses on the court!

15:32.665 --> 15:35.479
Where the [bleep] you think
you going, Nappy King Cole?

15:35.514 --> 15:38.468
- Out on the court, Coach.
- You ain't going nowhere, mother[bleep]!

15:38.470 --> 15:41.541
- Why not?
- Do I gotta click it to you, Mutombo?

15:41.576 --> 15:44.599
You don't know
 the rules to the game!

15:44.634 --> 15:47.028
I can't have you out there,
kicking the basketball

15:47.029 --> 15:50.113
like it's goddamn soccer!
It's a miracle you even got on shoes.

15:50.115 --> 15:51.748
Man, this-tarbaby
on-some-end-Aparteid

15:51.750 --> 15:53.550
free-Madoo-voovoozella
type-shit.

15:56.388 --> 15:59.849
What happened to him?
He look like a pair of police boot.

15:59.884 --> 16:03.360
Eww, he look like a glass of Coke
with two lemons. Ah!

16:03.362 --> 16:06.496
Bro's black as shit!

16:06.498 --> 16:08.665
- The [bleep] y'all want?
- Yo, Milk, what's good?

16:08.667 --> 16:11.134
Why you rolling up on me like
I'm selling loose cigarettes?

16:11.136 --> 16:13.370
We with you.
No need to get mad at us.

16:13.372 --> 16:15.872
- Just calm down!
- I am calm, buster!

16:15.874 --> 16:19.376
Nice moves on the court,
Ashy Mamba.

16:19.378 --> 16:20.944
It's like the whole world against me

16:20.946 --> 16:22.746
and now y'all gon' front on me, too?

16:24.183 --> 16:27.184
Aww, what's the matter?
You gonna cry?

16:27.186 --> 16:29.082
Probably cries shoe polish.

16:29.117 --> 16:31.121
Get it?
'Cause he's so black?

16:31.557 --> 16:34.780
<i>- Harambe.
- You buy and go!</i>

16:34.815 --> 16:37.494
<i>- Stop resisting.
- You look like you've been in a fire.</i>

16:37.496 --> 16:39.563
<i>Bro's black as shit.</i>

16:39.565 --> 16:40.530
<i>- Draymond.
- Draymond.</i>

16:40.532 --> 16:42.499
<i>Draymond!</i>

16:44.236 --> 16:46.370
Hey, what's wrong with you?
You need to chill.

16:46.372 --> 16:47.671
Need to chill?

16:47.673 --> 16:49.806
Need to chill?!
Need to chill?!!

16:52.611 --> 16:53.777
Oh, goddamn.

16:53.779 --> 16:57.748
- You got something to say?
- Man, come on, man, don't nobody care...

16:57.750 --> 16:59.750
Damn, nigga.
That's gon' leave a mark.

17:07.059 --> 17:10.073
Okay, Milk, chill.
You got 'em.

17:10.108 --> 17:13.396
Yeah, so why don't you
just take it easy?

17:13.398 --> 17:15.690
Why I always gotta be
the one to take it easy?

17:15.724 --> 17:17.087
Why, Jamal?
Huh?

17:17.122 --> 17:19.803
'Cause you look like
Draymond, my nig.

17:22.974 --> 17:25.909
Uh, we may need to do
something about this

17:25.911 --> 17:28.645
- before it gets out of hand.
- Yeah, I know.

17:28.647 --> 17:32.482
Let's go to Starbucks,
sit outside, and brainstorm.

17:34.739 --> 17:37.087
- Oh, shit.
- Yeezus Christ!

17:37.089 --> 17:38.922
Sorry, cuz, I thought
you was an intruder.

17:38.924 --> 17:40.891
- My bad.
- But you in my house.

17:40.893 --> 17:44.328
Hey, stall Shea out.
He trying to protect our castle.

17:44.330 --> 17:46.986
It's called
Homeland Security, nigga.

17:47.021 --> 17:48.031
Montrel, we need your help.

17:48.033 --> 17:50.167
Let me guess,
white boy done snapped,

17:50.169 --> 17:53.870
- tearing shit up and shit.
- Wow, is you telepathic?

17:53.872 --> 17:56.640
Man, I been watching it
on Worldstar all day.

17:56.642 --> 17:58.275
That shit hilarious.

17:58.277 --> 18:00.043
Good, now he know
what it's like.

18:00.045 --> 18:01.845
What is you talking about, Malik?

18:01.847 --> 18:04.314
I'm the one who turned up the dial
on that counterfeit negro.

18:04.316 --> 18:07.050
He needed to learn a lesson
on the actual factual black.

18:07.052 --> 18:08.985
You know Milk can't handle
that kind of darkness.

18:08.987 --> 18:11.288
Hey, you shoulda stopped
at Wesley, cuz.

18:11.290 --> 18:13.349
You right.
Milk hasn't had a lifetime

18:13.384 --> 18:16.026
to build up enough stamina
for all that niggy-ness.

18:16.028 --> 18:19.000
We gotta figure out a way
to boot him back to Bieber.

18:19.035 --> 18:21.598
Man, real talk,
I wouldn't change shit.

18:21.600 --> 18:24.301
- I [bleep] with that nigga.
- If you wanna unblack Milk,

18:24.303 --> 18:26.303
you gotta get him
an old-fashioned "blaxorcism."

18:26.305 --> 18:28.143
And I know a place
that can hook you up.

18:28.200 --> 18:31.219
Just like they did
Raven-Symoné, cuz.

18:31.235 --> 18:34.205
<i>Hmm, this is very troubling. </i>

18:34.207 --> 18:35.906
<i>You were right to come here.</i>

18:35.908 --> 18:37.308
At this rate, this young man is

18:37.310 --> 18:39.710
going to either end up dead,
in prison,

18:39.712 --> 18:42.346
or married
to a reality show Armenian.

18:42.348 --> 18:44.281
Those first two are viable options,

18:44.283 --> 18:47.184
but I will not tolerate the third.

18:47.186 --> 18:48.819
Is there anything you can do?

18:48.821 --> 18:50.654
We've had
a great deal of success

18:50.656 --> 18:52.990
dealing with angry black men.

18:52.992 --> 18:55.292
You just leave him to us.

19:04.036 --> 19:07.838
Get off me, homey!
What y'all doing?

19:13.613 --> 19:15.980
Whichever nig got me up here
about to catch a fade.

19:15.982 --> 19:18.449
<i>Oh, you think
you're tough, huh?</i>

19:18.451 --> 19:21.585
- Who said that?
- It's me, Joe Jackson.

19:21.587 --> 19:22.853
Uh, Rebbie's dad?

19:22.855 --> 19:24.655
I'm sorry, who?
Oh, that's right.

19:24.657 --> 19:26.991
She the one that did "Centipede."
Yeah, that's me.

19:26.993 --> 19:29.126
They put me in charge
of lightening you up, boy.

19:29.128 --> 19:31.023
Worked for Michael.

19:31.058 --> 19:32.730
Who do you think changed
his look in '89?

19:32.732 --> 19:36.066
And '94? And here's how
I'm gonna change you.

19:36.068 --> 19:37.168
I'm gon' break you.

19:37.169 --> 19:38.269
I'm gon' work you.

19:38.271 --> 19:40.271
I'ma whip you
till your back gives out.

19:40.273 --> 19:42.907
And that will be the story
of you, Milk.

19:42.909 --> 19:44.241
You put your hands on me,

19:44.243 --> 19:46.410
and I'm gonna stick my foot
up your ass, buster.

19:46.412 --> 19:48.646
O-ho, you wanna be starting
something, huh?

19:48.648 --> 19:49.798
You think you're bad?

19:49.799 --> 19:52.149
Well, I'm off the wall.

19:52.151 --> 19:53.017
Now...

19:53.019 --> 19:54.430
- Ah!
- What's your name, boy?

19:54.465 --> 19:55.653
Milk.

19:55.655 --> 19:57.554
Your name is Tito.

19:57.556 --> 19:58.522
I mean Milton.

19:58.524 --> 20:02.927
That is for making me
correct myself.

20:04.764 --> 20:06.597
Now, what's your name, boy?

20:06.599 --> 20:08.465
Milton.

20:08.467 --> 20:10.726
- What's this?
- It's your Oscar.

20:10.761 --> 20:12.503
All white people get one.

20:12.839 --> 20:14.972
What up, my dudes?

20:17.310 --> 20:19.076
Sorry we had to put you
through all that,

20:19.078 --> 20:21.879
- but you was getting out of pocket.
- Don't even sweat it.

20:21.881 --> 20:23.981
From now on, I'ma leave
the dark-skinned stuff

20:23.983 --> 20:25.582
to Terry Crews's forehead.

20:25.584 --> 20:27.738
I'm just glad everything
is black to normal.

20:27.773 --> 20:29.163
Now that you white again,

20:29.198 --> 20:31.388
you gotta pay back all those
nigs you was popping off

20:31.390 --> 20:34.024
when you thought you was
a real nig, my nig.

20:36.228 --> 20:39.330
Ah, easy with the nails,
my nig! Ah!
