<i>of hytritium</i>

00:14.917 --> 00:17.875
<i>from the Zibalian trader,</i>

00:14.917 --> 00:17.875
<i>Kivas Fajo.</i>

00:17.917 --> 00:21.625
<i>Because pure hytritium</i>

00:17.917 --> 00:21.625
<i>is too unstable</i>

00:17.917 --> 00:21.625
<i>for our transporters,</i>

00:21.667 --> 00:23.250
<i>Lieutenant Commander Data</i>

00:29.625 --> 00:31.250
PICARD:

00:29.625 --> 00:31.250
Go ahead, Mr. Data.

00:31.291 --> 00:32.917
This will be the last trip,

00:31.291 --> 00:32.917
sir.

00:32.959 --> 00:35.375
The remaining cases of hytritium

00:32.959 --> 00:35.375
are now being loaded.

00:35.417 --> 00:36.542
Acknowledged.

00:36.583 --> 00:39.375
Mr. Worf,

00:36.583 --> 00:39.375
advise Beta Agni Two

00:39.417 --> 00:40.333
that our departure is imminent.

00:40.375 --> 00:42.083
WORF:

00:40.375 --> 00:42.083
Aye, Captain.

00:42.125 --> 00:45.583
At warp six, we should be there

00:42.125 --> 00:45.583
at just over 16 hours.

00:49.458 --> 00:50.959
Loading is complete.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.542
I am now proceeding

00:51.000 --> 00:53.542
with departure.

00:53.583 --> 00:56.750
<i>Enterprise</i> shuttle bay two,

00:53.583 --> 00:56.750

Level one precautions

00:56.792 --> 01:00.917
for incoming material

01:00.959 --> 01:02.417
remain in effect.

01:02.458 --> 01:05.667
If you'll just acknowledge

01:02.458 --> 01:05.667
this last load, Commander.

01:17.792 --> 01:21.500

On viewer.

01:42.417 --> 01:44.166
Containment field stable.

01:44.208 --> 01:47.959
Gravitational fluctuations

01:44.208 --> 01:47.959

02:37.875 --> 02:42.625

02:37.875 --> 02:42.625

04:05.917 --> 04:07.709
Unknown, Commander.

04:07.750 --> 04:09.375
Hail the<i> Jovis.</i> I want to speak

04:07.750 --> 04:09.375
with Kivas Fajo.

04:09.417 --> 04:12.083
Sir, Mr. Fajo

04:09.417 --> 04:12.083
is hailing<i> us.</i>

04:12.125 --> 04:13.250
On viewer.

04:13.291 --> 04:16.417
Captain Picard,

04:13.291 --> 04:16.417
what happened?

04:16.458 --> 04:17.750
It's unclear.

04:17.792 --> 04:19.375
We're running

04:17.792 --> 04:19.375
a full analysis.

04:19.417 --> 04:22.083
We detected no malfunctions

04:19.417 --> 04:22.083
before the explosion.

04:22.125 --> 04:23.375
Everything seemed to be running

04:23.417 --> 04:24.875
as smoothly

04:23.417 --> 04:24.875
as the other flights.

04:24.917 --> 04:27.667
Were you able to save the pilot?

04:27.709 --> 04:29.709
No.

04:29.750 --> 04:32.208
I'm sorry.

04:32.250 --> 04:35.917
Mr. Fajo,

04:32.250 --> 04:35.917
I would like to analyze

04:35.959 --> 04:38.583
your sensor readings

04:35.959 --> 04:38.583
of the explosion.

04:38.625 --> 04:41.125
Compared to the<i> Enterprise's,</i>

04:38.625 --> 04:41.125
our sensors are

04:41.166 --> 04:43.083
rather primitive.

04:43.125 --> 04:46.375
I doubt they contain any

04:43.125 --> 04:46.375
information that your sensors

04:43.125 --> 04:46.375
overlooked.

04:46.417 --> 04:49.458
Perhaps, but I don't want to

04:46.417 --> 04:49.458
leave any avenue unexplored.

04:49.500 --> 04:51.542
I understand.

04:51.583 --> 04:55.875
We'll transmit the information.

04:55.917 --> 04:57.667
Link established.

04:57.709 --> 04:58.959
Receiving.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.291
Can we be of any further

04:59.000 --> 05:01.291
assistance?

05:01.333 --> 05:03.750
How much hytritium

05:01.333 --> 05:03.750
did we manage

05:01.333 --> 05:03.750
to bring on board?

05:03.792 --> 05:05.500
81 kilos.

05:05.542 --> 05:07.375
That may barely allow us to

05:05.542 --> 05:07.375
complete our mission, Captain,

05:07.417 --> 05:08.959
but it leaves us no margin

05:07.417 --> 05:08.959
for error.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.500
Mr. Fajo, I realize we have

05:09.000 --> 05:11.500
acquired

05:11.542 --> 05:13.750
your entire supply

05:11.542 --> 05:13.750
of hytritium.

05:13.792 --> 05:15.834
Do you know where

05:13.792 --> 05:15.834
we could obtain some more?

05:15.875 --> 05:19.291
That may be difficult.

05:15.875 --> 05:19.291
The only source I know is in

05:15.875 --> 05:19.291
the Sigma Erani system?

05:19.333 --> 05:20.750
Three weeks away, sir.

05:20.792 --> 05:23.125
And I can't guarantee

05:20.792 --> 05:23.125
they'll have any.

05:23.166 --> 05:25.375
For obvious reasons, no one

05:23.166 --> 05:25.375
wants to keep it around.

05:25.417 --> 05:28.458
In fact, even I may stop

05:25.417 --> 05:28.458
selling it.

05:28.500 --> 05:30.542
It's just too dangerous.

05:30.583 --> 05:32.625
I guess we're fortunate

05:30.583 --> 05:32.625
you had any at all, sir.

05:32.667 --> 05:35.625
Captain, transfer of

05:32.667 --> 05:35.625
information complete.

05:35.667 --> 05:37.834
Mr. Fajo...

05:37.875 --> 05:40.041
thank you for your help.

05:43.458 --> 05:46.458
Mr. Crusher, set a course for

05:43.458 --> 05:46.458
the Beta Agni Two system.

05:43.458 --> 05:46.458
Warp six.

05:46.500 --> 05:47.834
Aye, sir.

05:47.875 --> 05:49.542
The<i> Grissom's</i> near the

05:47.875 --> 05:49.542
Sigma Erani system.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.959
I'll alert them to stand by in

05:49.583 --> 05:51.959
case we need more hytritium.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.125
Thank you, Number One.

05:53.166 --> 05:55.750
Course laid in, sir.

05:59.458 --> 06:01.625
Engage.

06:35.583 --> 06:37.583
What am I doing here?

06:37.625 --> 06:38.709
(<i> door opens</i> )

06:44.333 --> 06:47.875
Oh. Wondrous.

06:47.917 --> 06:51.583
The detail, the balance.

06:53.542 --> 06:56.500
Was I not right, Varria?

06:56.542 --> 07:01.333
Oh, what a remarkable

06:56.542 --> 07:01.333
piece of work, hmm?

07:01.375 --> 07:03.041
Why have I

07:01.375 --> 07:03.041
been brought here?

07:03.083 --> 07:04.709
Oh!

07:04.750 --> 07:07.083
The... the voice simulation.

07:07.125 --> 07:09.041
It's... it's perfection.

07:09.083 --> 07:11.458
The inflections,

07:09.083 --> 07:11.458
the timing.

07:11.500 --> 07:13.417
(<i> snapping fingers</i> )

07:13.458 --> 07:14.917
(<i> laughing</i> )

07:14.959 --> 07:16.291
(<i> clears throat</i> )

07:16.333 --> 07:20.959
Yes, uh, it took great

07:16.333 --> 07:20.959
effort, effort...

07:21.000 --> 07:23.125
to bring you here.

07:23.166 --> 07:24.542
I was sure

07:23.166 --> 07:24.542
it would be worth it.

07:24.583 --> 07:25.792
I was right.

07:25.834 --> 07:27.750
I've been delivered here

07:25.834 --> 07:27.750
against my wishes.

07:27.792 --> 07:29.375
I would like

07:27.792 --> 07:29.375
to know the reason.

07:29.417 --> 07:30.834
Certainly.

07:30.875 --> 07:35.125
You have been brought here

07:30.875 --> 07:35.125
for my... enjoyment

07:35.166 --> 07:38.291
and my appreciation.

07:38.333 --> 07:41.291
Am I to infer that you intend

07:38.333 --> 07:41.291
to keep me captive?

07:41.333 --> 07:42.667
Captive? Captive?

07:42.709 --> 07:45.166
Oh, it's such

07:42.709 --> 07:45.166
an inappropriate description.

07:45.208 --> 07:48.750
My dear android...

07:48.792 --> 07:50.208
may I call you Data?

07:50.250 --> 07:52.291
It is my name.

07:52.333 --> 07:58.208
Data, you will be catered to,

07:52.333 --> 07:58.208
fawned over,

07:58.250 --> 08:00.083
cared for as you never

07:58.250 --> 08:00.083
have been before.

08:00.125 --> 08:04.125
Your every wish

08:00.125 --> 08:04.125
will be fulfilled.

08:04.166 --> 08:06.667
I wish to leave.

08:06.709 --> 08:09.166
Almost every wish.

08:09.208 --> 08:10.583
This is unacceptable, sir.

08:10.625 --> 08:13.542
I have no desire to remain here,

08:10.625 --> 08:13.542
and even if I did,

08:13.583 --> 08:15.959
my Starfleet duties

08:13.583 --> 08:15.959
would not allow it.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.792
It's so...

08:16.000 --> 08:19.792
single-minded, isn't it?

08:19.834 --> 08:21.500
Very persistent.

08:21.542 --> 08:24.250
But it's polite,

08:21.542 --> 08:24.250
which is a very nice touch.

08:24.291 --> 08:26.792
I decline to allow you to go.

08:26.834 --> 08:30.625
Then I am forced

08:26.834 --> 08:30.625
to attempt escape.

08:35.959 --> 08:38.291
Uh, ten androids

08:38.333 --> 08:41.500
just like you<i> might</i> be able

08:38.333 --> 08:41.500
to force that thing open.

08:41.542 --> 08:44.709
But then again, there aren't any

08:41.542 --> 08:44.709
more just like you, are there?

08:44.750 --> 08:47.667
It's keyed to galvanic

08:44.750 --> 08:47.667
skin responses

08:47.709 --> 08:49.875
and DNA patterns.

08:49.917 --> 08:51.625
Sorry.

08:51.667 --> 08:53.583
Then you will have to open it

08:51.667 --> 08:53.583
for me.

09:07.500 --> 09:09.709
Oh.

09:09.750 --> 09:14.083
Really, I wouldn't do that

09:09.750 --> 09:14.083
again if I were you.

09:14.125 --> 09:16.792
This is a proximity-actuated

09:14.125 --> 09:16.792
field.

09:16.834 --> 09:18.375
It impedes positron flow.

09:18.417 --> 09:21.917
It's very bad for the brain

09:18.417 --> 09:21.917
paths in the long term.

09:21.959 --> 09:26.083
I fail to understand

09:21.959 --> 09:26.083
the value you place

09:21.959 --> 09:26.083
on my presence.

09:26.125 --> 09:27.917
Well, just look

09:26.125 --> 09:27.917
around the room.

09:27.959 --> 09:30.208
There are items here gathered

09:27.959 --> 09:30.208
from half the galaxy.

09:30.250 --> 09:32.000
Right here--

09:32.041 --> 09:37.667
this is the very first basotile

09:32.041 --> 09:37.667
ever created.

09:41.166 --> 09:44.583
Oh, sorry.

09:44.625 --> 09:46.792
It's very, very ancient.

09:46.834 --> 09:48.792
Hundreds of years old.

09:48.834 --> 09:51.083
Oh, it's priceless.

09:51.125 --> 09:53.333
Come. This vase?

09:53.375 --> 09:56.542
This vase is made

09:53.375 --> 09:56.542
by Mark Off...

09:56.583 --> 09:59.542
the late Mark Off-Zel

09:56.583 --> 09:59.542
from Sirrie-Four.

09:59.583 --> 10:01.792
A Dali.

10:01.834 --> 10:03.291
This...

10:03.333 --> 10:06.834
this is the only known

10:03.333 --> 10:06.834
Roger Maris trading card

10:06.875 --> 10:10.709
from Earth, circa 1962.

10:15.041 --> 10:17.333
The smell?

10:17.375 --> 10:20.875
Bubble gum--

10:17.375 --> 10:20.875
I've preserved the scent.

10:20.917 --> 10:23.166
Ah.

10:23.208 --> 10:24.792
Uh... what, what?

10:24.834 --> 10:26.875
Ah, a lapling.

10:26.917 --> 10:28.750
(<i> humming</i> )

10:31.500 --> 10:33.875
I thought they were extinct.

10:33.917 --> 10:35.709
Extinct? Oh, good.

10:35.750 --> 10:39.125
Yes, well, that is what

10:35.750 --> 10:39.125
is generally believed.

10:39.166 --> 10:42.750
She is the last surviving

10:39.166 --> 10:42.750
member of her species.

10:42.792 --> 10:44.208
(<i> humming</i> )

10:44.250 --> 10:45.583
(<i> chuckles</i> )

10:45.625 --> 10:48.208
(<i> humming</i> )

10:51.208 --> 10:54.500
They're very defenseless

10:51.208 --> 10:54.500
creatures, really.

10:54.542 --> 10:58.625
Everything that you see

10:54.542 --> 10:58.625
in the room here, everything,

10:58.667 --> 11:01.166
one of a kind, unique.

11:01.208 --> 11:03.166
All original.

11:03.208 --> 11:05.250
Just as you are.

11:05.291 --> 11:08.667
There, that is your

11:05.291 --> 11:08.667
place of honor.

11:08.709 --> 11:10.750
(<i> chuckles</i> )

11:10.792 --> 11:12.959
Sit, sit.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.625
Sit.

11:16.375 --> 11:19.500
You think perhaps it might

11:16.375 --> 11:19.500
be uncomfortable?

11:19.542 --> 11:21.792
But then again, you don't give a

11:19.542 --> 11:21.792
thought to comfort, do you?

11:21.834 --> 11:25.750
When Palor Toff learns of that,

11:25.792 --> 11:27.291
he'll swallow his tongue

11:25.792 --> 11:27.291
with envy.

11:27.333 --> 11:30.125
I can't wait to see his face.

11:30.166 --> 11:32.291
You... you are, um...

11:32.333 --> 11:36.041
the crown jewel

11:32.333 --> 11:36.041
of my collection.

11:36.083 --> 11:38.625
You're a treasure

11:36.083 --> 11:38.625
beyond comparison.

11:38.667 --> 11:41.041
(<i> beeping</i> )

11:41.083 --> 11:43.250
Yes, go ahead.

11:46.333 --> 11:49.208
I think you should be flattered.

11:49.250 --> 11:50.875
I am not, sir.

11:50.917 --> 11:54.667
Most intelligent life-forms

11:50.917 --> 11:54.667
find involuntary confinement

11:54.709 --> 11:56.417
offensive and inequitable.

11:56.458 --> 11:58.625
Moreover, you have violated

11:56.458 --> 11:58.625
Federation law--

11:58.667 --> 12:00.417
I know, I know.

12:00.458 --> 12:03.750
What I've done is evil, selfish,

12:00.458 --> 12:03.750
immoral, unprincipled, illegal.

12:03.792 --> 12:06.667
Well I've learned to

12:03.792 --> 12:06.667
live with it.

12:06.709 --> 12:08.417
The Andorians

12:06.709 --> 12:08.417
wish to make a bid

12:08.458 --> 12:10.875
on the shipment

12:08.458 --> 12:10.875
of Tellurian spices you offered.

12:10.917 --> 12:13.041
They've had four days to decide!

12:13.083 --> 12:15.542
Why do they decide right--

12:13.083 --> 12:15.542
All right.

12:18.083 --> 12:21.166
I must emphasize,

12:18.083 --> 12:21.166
Mr. Fajo,

12:21.208 --> 12:25.291
that I consider this captivity

12:21.208 --> 12:25.291
a hostile act on your part.

12:25.333 --> 12:28.750
Oh. Well, you'll

12:25.333 --> 12:28.750
get used to it.

12:33.333 --> 12:35.750
(<i> screeches</i> )

12:50.000 --> 12:52.625
I can't believe he's gone.

12:52.667 --> 12:56.834
Yeah, well I always thought

12:52.667 --> 12:56.834
he'd outlive us by centuries.

12:56.875 --> 13:01.250
He'd been working on this

12:56.875 --> 13:01.250
for months.

13:01.291 --> 13:04.583
Never felt it was

13:01.291 --> 13:04.583
quite finished.

13:04.625 --> 13:06.667
You know what a critic

13:04.625 --> 13:06.667
Data was,

13:06.709 --> 13:08.875
especially about

13:06.709 --> 13:08.875
his own work.

13:29.333 --> 13:31.291
That was a gift from the

13:29.333 --> 13:31.291
captain.

13:33.250 --> 13:35.792
And he should have it back.

13:43.375 --> 13:45.333
Those should go

13:43.375 --> 13:45.333
to Commander Riker.

13:45.375 --> 13:49.208
Data always fell

13:45.375 --> 13:49.208
for Riker's bluffs.

13:50.208 --> 13:51.959
(<i> whistles</i> )

14:00.166 --> 14:03.458
These are some of Starfleet's

14:00.166 --> 14:03.458
highest honors.

14:03.500 --> 14:04.834
Not bad for a walking

14:03.500 --> 14:04.834
pile of circuitry

14:04.875 --> 14:07.083
and memory cells.

14:25.458 --> 14:28.083
You know,

14:28.125 --> 14:31.291
I keep going over and over

14:28.125 --> 14:31.291
the accident in my mind

14:31.333 --> 14:33.291
trying to figure out

14:31.333 --> 14:33.291
what went wrong.

14:33.333 --> 14:36.375
I can see Data

14:33.333 --> 14:36.375
in the shuttle

14:36.417 --> 14:38.583
almost like

14:36.417 --> 14:38.583
I'm sitting there next to him

14:38.625 --> 14:42.959
going through

14:38.625 --> 14:42.959
the departure sequence.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.333
What the hell happened?

14:46.375 --> 14:50.667
Why didn't I see it coming?

14:50.709 --> 14:52.417
What am I missing?

15:02.959 --> 15:07.041
Kivas wishes you to wear

15:02.959 --> 15:07.041
this set of clothes

15:07.083 --> 15:09.542
and to sit

15:07.083 --> 15:09.542
in your chair.

15:09.583 --> 15:13.208
I have no reason to accede

15:09.583 --> 15:13.208
to Mr. Fajo's wishes.

15:13.250 --> 15:15.709
He will give

15:13.250 --> 15:15.709
you reasons

15:15.750 --> 15:17.959
if you force him to.

15:18.000 --> 15:22.125
Mr. Fajo is deluding himself if

15:18.000 --> 15:22.125
he believes he can keep me here.

15:22.166 --> 15:24.125
The<i> Enterprise</i> is certain

15:22.166 --> 15:24.125
to find me.

15:24.166 --> 15:26.000
They're not even

15:24.166 --> 15:26.000
looking for you.

15:26.041 --> 15:28.041
They think you're destroyed.

15:28.083 --> 15:30.083
Your shuttle blew up.

15:30.125 --> 15:32.250
A hytritium explosion.

15:32.291 --> 15:35.208
They will scan the debris and

15:32.291 --> 15:35.208
discover I was not aboard.

15:35.250 --> 15:37.208
They'll find exactly what they

15:35.250 --> 15:37.208
thought they'd find--

15:37.250 --> 15:39.792
traces of your

15:37.250 --> 15:39.792
component elements.

15:39.834 --> 15:44.583
We put them aboard the shuttle

15:39.834 --> 15:44.583
in just the right proportions.

15:46.834 --> 15:50.208
Clearly, Mr. Fajo

15:46.834 --> 15:50.208
has no moral difficulty

15:50.250 --> 15:51.542
with my imprisonment here.

15:51.583 --> 15:55.917
Mr. Fajo has

15:51.583 --> 15:55.917
no moral difficulties at all.

15:55.959 --> 15:58.709
Do you?

15:58.750 --> 16:01.041
Clever, android.

16:01.083 --> 16:04.166
Is it part of your program

16:01.083 --> 16:04.166
to seek out vulnerabilities

16:04.208 --> 16:05.417
in your enemies?

16:05.458 --> 16:08.542
Yes. Are you my enemy?

16:08.583 --> 16:12.083
I obey Fajo and so does everyone

16:08.583 --> 16:12.083
on this ship.

16:12.125 --> 16:13.458
Why?

16:13.500 --> 16:16.500
You are a curious thing,

16:13.500 --> 16:16.500
aren't you?

16:16.542 --> 16:18.917
Do you object to the question?

16:18.959 --> 16:22.625
Kivas finds ways to get

16:18.959 --> 16:22.625
what he wants from his people.

16:22.667 --> 16:26.333
His rewards for loyalty

16:22.667 --> 16:26.333
are lavish.

16:26.375 --> 16:33.208
His punishments for

16:26.375 --> 16:33.208
disloyalty are equally...

16:33.250 --> 16:35.208
lavish.

16:35.250 --> 16:37.542
You won't find anyone

16:37.583 --> 16:39.583
here on this ship

16:37.583 --> 16:39.583
to help you escape.

16:39.625 --> 16:42.000
Face it, android.

16:42.041 --> 16:44.041
He has you.

16:45.417 --> 16:48.083
It appears...

16:48.125 --> 16:50.333
he has us both.

16:59.208 --> 17:01.083
The reason

16:59.208 --> 17:01.083
I can't find anything

17:01.125 --> 17:03.166
is that there's

17:01.125 --> 17:03.166
nothing to find.

17:03.208 --> 17:05.166
I've run this analysis

17:03.208 --> 17:05.166
dozen's of times over,

17:05.208 --> 17:07.625
and there's just no indication

17:05.208 --> 17:07.625
of any malfunction.

17:07.667 --> 17:09.083
No explanation at all?

17:09.125 --> 17:11.959
Oh, yeah, there's one,

17:09.125 --> 17:11.959
but I don't believe it.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.041
Pilot error?

17:14.083 --> 17:16.542
I know it's hard to accept,

17:14.083 --> 17:16.542
but even the best...

17:16.583 --> 17:20.333
Captain, it's not only hard

17:16.583 --> 17:20.333
to accept with Data,

17:16.583 --> 17:20.333
it's impossible.

17:20.375 --> 17:23.834
I mean, I can't even begin

17:20.375 --> 17:23.834
to calculate the odds.

17:23.875 --> 17:25.250
It's...

17:25.291 --> 17:30.750
well, if Data were here,

17:25.291 --> 17:30.750
we could ask him.

17:31.917 --> 17:33.834
What are you suggesting,

17:31.917 --> 17:33.834
Lieutenant?

17:33.875 --> 17:35.583
I don't know, sir.

17:35.625 --> 17:39.583
It just doesn't

17:35.625 --> 17:39.583
make sense.

17:39.625 --> 17:41.959
And I like for things

17:39.625 --> 17:41.959
to make sense, that's all.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.875
Geordi, maybe if you got

17:42.000 --> 17:44.875
a little rest,

17:44.917 --> 17:46.917
and you came at this

17:44.917 --> 17:46.917
thing fresh.

17:46.959 --> 17:49.792
A little rest isn't going to

17:46.959 --> 17:49.792
change the computer analysis,

17:46.959 --> 17:49.792
Commander.

17:49.834 --> 17:52.834
I'm sure you have done

17:49.834 --> 17:52.834
a complete investigation,

17:52.875 --> 17:56.083
and if you wish to continue it,

17:52.875 --> 17:56.083
of course, you have my full

17:52.875 --> 17:56.083
support.

17:56.125 --> 18:00.125
But we shall be reaching

17:56.125 --> 18:00.125
the Beta Agni system shortly,

18:00.166 --> 18:03.375
and I expect you to be rested.

18:05.166 --> 18:08.417
I understand, sir.

18:08.458 --> 18:10.542
Dismissed.

18:12.583 --> 18:13.875
Geordi...

18:17.041 --> 18:21.333
I understand

18:17.041 --> 18:21.333
how much we want...

18:21.375 --> 18:22.667
(<i> sighs</i> )

18:22.709 --> 18:26.542
even need to explain

18:22.709 --> 18:26.542
an accident like this.

18:26.583 --> 18:29.417
Sometimes there just aren't

18:26.583 --> 18:29.417
any explanations.

18:43.417 --> 18:45.875
For an android

18:43.417 --> 18:45.875
with no feelings,

18:45.917 --> 18:48.875
he sure managed

18:45.917 --> 18:48.875
to evoke them in others.

18:48.917 --> 18:52.000
We must select an officer

18:48.917 --> 18:52.000
to replace Data at ops.

18:52.041 --> 18:53.208
Recommendations?

18:53.250 --> 18:56.166
Worf would be

18:53.250 --> 18:56.166
my first choice, sir.

18:56.208 --> 18:58.375
Mine as well.

18:58.417 --> 19:00.041
Make it so.

19:11.250 --> 19:13.208
"He was a man.

19:13.250 --> 19:16.083
"Take him for all in all.

19:16.125 --> 19:20.792
I shall not look upon

19:16.125 --> 19:20.792
his like again."

19:28.458 --> 19:29.792
Lu-lu-lu-lu-lu.

19:29.834 --> 19:31.417
Lu-lu.

19:35.750 --> 19:40.250
You are still wearing

19:35.750 --> 19:40.250
that uniform. Why?

19:40.291 --> 19:41.750
I am a Starfleet officer.

19:41.792 --> 19:45.458
You are not

19:41.792 --> 19:45.458
<i>in</i> Starfleet any longer.

19:45.500 --> 19:48.083
It's time you adjusted

19:45.500 --> 19:48.083
your program to accept reality.

19:48.125 --> 19:51.417
Even if I chose to do so, it is

19:48.125 --> 19:51.417
doubtful that my program

19:51.458 --> 19:54.375
could be sufficiently altered

19:51.458 --> 19:54.375
to accede to your wishes.

19:56.083 --> 19:57.166
Oh?

19:57.208 --> 19:58.625
I have been designed

19:58.667 --> 20:01.458
with a fundamental respect for

19:58.667 --> 20:01.458
life in all its forms

20:01.500 --> 20:04.792
and a strong inhibition against

20:01.500 --> 20:04.792
causing harm to living beings.

20:04.834 --> 20:06.542
What a marvelous

20:04.834 --> 20:06.542
contradiction--

20:06.583 --> 20:08.250
a military pacifist.

20:08.291 --> 20:10.583
Tell me, whose

20:08.291 --> 20:10.583
dreadful idea was it

20:10.625 --> 20:14.166
to enlist you in Starfleet

20:10.625 --> 20:14.166
to begin with?

20:14.208 --> 20:15.875
My skills seemed appropriate

20:14.208 --> 20:15.875
to...

20:15.917 --> 20:18.875
Data, Data, Data,

20:15.917 --> 20:18.875
big mistake, grievous error.

20:18.917 --> 20:20.333
You belong in Starfleet

20:20.375 --> 20:25.959
about as much as I belong

20:20.375 --> 20:25.959
in a verbal contract.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.917
Tell me, Data,

20:26.000 --> 20:27.917
have you killed yet?

20:27.959 --> 20:30.208
No, but I am programmed

20:30.250 --> 20:34.709
with the ability to use deadly

20:30.250 --> 20:34.709
force in the cause of defense.

20:34.750 --> 20:36.667
Shame on you.

20:36.709 --> 20:38.083
Shame on you.

20:38.125 --> 20:40.875
How neatly you rationalize

20:38.125 --> 20:40.875
your capabilities.

20:40.917 --> 20:44.500
How can you just casually

20:40.917 --> 20:44.500
accept your role in murder?

20:44.542 --> 20:46.250
I would not participate

20:44.542 --> 20:46.250
in a murder.

20:46.291 --> 20:48.000
Perhaps you misunderstand.

20:48.041 --> 20:51.834
Can't you see how much better

20:48.041 --> 20:51.834
it would be for you right here?

20:51.875 --> 20:54.083
The intellectual rewards

20:51.875 --> 20:54.083
alone...

20:54.125 --> 20:56.959
our personal exploration

20:54.125 --> 20:56.959
of the galaxy.

20:57.000 --> 21:00.709
I am at war with no one.

21:00.750 --> 21:03.000
I'm your liberator.

21:03.041 --> 21:05.250
You are a fine debater, sir.

21:05.291 --> 21:06.959
It is a pity you have used

21:05.291 --> 21:06.959
your verbal skills

21:07.000 --> 21:08.375
for mere hucksterism

21:08.417 --> 21:10.792
and the advancement

21:08.417 --> 21:10.792
of your own greed.

21:10.834 --> 21:13.875
Perhaps...

21:13.917 --> 21:15.792
perhaps you would not judge me

21:13.917 --> 21:15.792
so harshly

21:15.834 --> 21:19.500
if you knew

21:15.834 --> 21:19.500
of my desperate youth wasted...

21:19.542 --> 21:23.000
wasted on the streets

21:19.542 --> 21:23.000
of Zibalia.

21:23.041 --> 21:26.542
Your past does not excuse

21:23.041 --> 21:26.542
unethical or immoral

21:23.041 --> 21:26.542
behavior, sir.

21:26.583 --> 21:28.208
No it doesn't matter,

21:26.583 --> 21:28.208
it isn't true anyway.

21:28.250 --> 21:29.792
My father was quite wealthy,

21:28.250 --> 21:29.792
actually.

21:29.834 --> 21:32.500
He was a thief.

21:32.542 --> 21:36.000
Data, why don't you put on

21:32.542 --> 21:36.000
these lovely new clothes

21:36.041 --> 21:37.041
and go sit on the chair.

21:37.083 --> 21:39.125
I must decline.

21:39.166 --> 21:41.875
You're going to be

21:39.166 --> 21:41.875
much more of a challenge

21:41.917 --> 21:44.125
than I had first thought.

21:47.542 --> 21:50.583
Finoplak. 100 denkirs.

21:53.041 --> 21:59.834
Now, Data, in the meantime,

21:53.041 --> 21:59.834
here is something

21:59.875 --> 22:03.542
for your logic circuits

21:59.875 --> 22:03.542
to analyze.

22:07.542 --> 22:11.083
Don't worry, the solvent

22:07.542 --> 22:11.083
won't harm your... skin.

22:11.125 --> 22:13.542
But in seconds,

22:11.125 --> 22:13.542
it will completely

22:13.583 --> 22:15.500
dissolve

22:13.583 --> 22:15.500
that uniform.

22:17.959 --> 22:20.709
Personally, I'd be

22:17.959 --> 22:20.709
delighted to see you

22:17.959 --> 22:20.709
go around naked.

22:20.750 --> 22:24.125
I assume you have no modesty.

22:24.166 --> 22:30.750
But then, I guess

22:24.166 --> 22:30.750
that decency is the rule

22:30.792 --> 22:33.709
of your

22:30.792 --> 22:33.709
Starfleet training.

22:33.750 --> 22:36.583
In any case, Data

22:36.625 --> 22:38.166
why don't you

22:36.625 --> 22:38.166
make a decision

22:38.208 --> 22:42.625
about which alternative

22:38.208 --> 22:42.625
you dislike the least.

22:42.667 --> 22:44.333
Make a decision

22:42.667 --> 22:44.333
by dinnertime tonight.

22:44.375 --> 22:46.208
I've invited

22:44.375 --> 22:46.208
a guest to meet you.

22:46.250 --> 22:48.166
And I expect you to be

22:46.250 --> 22:48.166
as entertaining with him

22:48.208 --> 22:51.458
as you have been with me.

23:10.208 --> 23:11.959
DATA:

23:10.208 --> 23:11.959
Proceeding with departure.

23:12.000 --> 23:15.500
<i>Enterprise,</i> shuttle bay two,

23:12.000 --> 23:15.500
prepare for docking.

23:15.542 --> 23:16.667
Level one precautions

23:16.709 --> 23:18.625
remain in effect.

23:24.500 --> 23:27.083
I did miss something.

23:40.959 --> 23:44.500
Your first watch at ops?

23:44.542 --> 23:47.709
I have served at

23:44.542 --> 23:47.709
the position before.

23:47.750 --> 23:50.834
I've been concerned

23:47.750 --> 23:50.834
about you.

23:50.875 --> 23:52.291
About me? Why?

23:52.333 --> 23:54.542
Because I know

23:52.333 --> 23:54.542
how I'd feel

23:54.583 --> 23:58.041
if I was asked to replace

23:54.583 --> 23:58.041
Data at his station.

24:02.083 --> 24:03.625
Bridge.

24:06.875 --> 24:11.041
Promotion due to the death

24:06.875 --> 24:11.041
of a crew mate

24:11.083 --> 24:13.375
is commonplace

24:11.083 --> 24:13.375
on Klingon ships.

24:13.417 --> 24:16.709
I know, but this

24:13.417 --> 24:16.709
isn't the Klingon ship

24:16.750 --> 24:20.709
and Data was your friend,

24:16.750 --> 24:20.709
and it's the second time

24:20.750 --> 24:25.375
you've replaced

24:20.750 --> 24:25.375
a crew mate who's died.

24:25.417 --> 24:28.417
I honor Data's memory

24:25.417 --> 24:28.417
as I did Lieutenant Yar's

24:28.458 --> 24:30.333
by attempting

24:28.458 --> 24:30.333
to perform their duties

24:30.375 --> 24:32.792
as well as they did.

24:32.834 --> 24:35.333
In true Klingon fashion.

24:38.542 --> 24:42.458
I appreciate your concern.

24:50.041 --> 24:53.166
Computer, now replay

24:50.041 --> 24:53.166
shuttle audio transmission

24:53.208 --> 24:56.625
time index: 0423.

24:56.667 --> 24:59.583
This is Data's second trip.

24:59.625 --> 25:01.750
Hmm? All right.

25:01.792 --> 25:03.375
DATA:

25:01.792 --> 25:03.375
Proceeding with departure.

25:03.417 --> 25:06.542
<i>Enterprise</i> shuttle bay two,

25:03.417 --> 25:06.542
prepare for docking.

25:06.583 --> 25:10.083
Level one precautions

25:06.583 --> 25:10.083
remain in effect.

25:10.125 --> 25:14.000
Shuttle has cleared

25:10.125 --> 25:14.000
<i>Jovis</i> cargo bay.

25:14.041 --> 25:15.458
It sounds just like

25:14.041 --> 25:15.458
the first trip.

25:15.500 --> 25:17.750
Exactly the same.

25:17.792 --> 25:20.083
That's protocol

25:17.792 --> 25:20.083
and that's Data--

25:20.125 --> 25:21.583
following protocol

25:20.125 --> 25:21.583
to the letter.

25:21.625 --> 25:25.000
Okay, computer, now replay

25:21.625 --> 25:25.000
shuttle audio transmission

25:25.041 --> 25:28.458
time index: 0439.

25:28.500 --> 25:29.959
Third and final trip.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.333
DATA:

25:30.000 --> 25:31.333
Loading is complete.

25:31.375 --> 25:33.709
I am proceeding with departure.

25:33.750 --> 25:37.000
<i>Enterprise</i> shuttle bay two,

25:33.750 --> 25:37.000
prepare for docking.

25:37.041 --> 25:40.291
Level one precautions

25:37.041 --> 25:40.291
remain in effect.

25:41.959 --> 25:44.333
That's it. That's the last

25:41.959 --> 25:44.333
communication.

25:44.375 --> 25:47.375
He didn't report the shuttle

25:44.375 --> 25:47.375
clearing the cargo bay

25:44.375 --> 25:47.375
of the<i> Jovis.</i>

25:47.417 --> 25:51.041
Of course, there really wasn't

25:47.417 --> 25:51.041
any reason for him to make voice

25:47.417 --> 25:51.041
contact.

25:51.083 --> 25:53.500
He knew we'd be monitoring

25:51.083 --> 25:53.500
his position.

25:53.542 --> 25:55.125
Any other pilot might not even

25:53.542 --> 25:55.125
have bothered.

25:55.166 --> 25:58.542
But Data, not following

25:55.166 --> 25:58.542
standard procedures?

25:58.583 --> 25:59.625
What do you think it means?

25:59.667 --> 26:01.166
I'm not sure, Wes.

26:01.208 --> 26:02.959
I suppose he could have

26:01.208 --> 26:02.959
been too busy.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.458
Maybe he saw something

26:03.000 --> 26:05.458
was wrong.

26:05.500 --> 26:07.291
Without communicating it?

26:07.333 --> 26:09.333
That doesn't sound like Data,

26:07.333 --> 26:09.333
either.

26:09.375 --> 26:13.792
Which means that maybe

26:09.375 --> 26:13.792
something was wrong with<i> him</i>

26:13.834 --> 26:16.458
but there's no other

26:13.834 --> 26:16.458
indication of that--

26:16.500 --> 26:20.959
nothing he said or did during

26:16.500 --> 26:20.959
the entire mission-- none.

26:21.000 --> 26:25.417
Sure wish I could talk

26:21.000 --> 26:25.417
to the last people

26:21.000 --> 26:25.417
who saw him alive.

26:31.750 --> 26:33.542
(<i> door chimes</i> )

26:33.583 --> 26:38.625
I've added a Veltan sex idol

26:33.583 --> 26:38.625
to my collection.

26:38.667 --> 26:40.375
I got four of them.

26:40.417 --> 26:41.375
What?

26:41.417 --> 26:44.083
With the pearls intact?

26:44.125 --> 26:45.375
Please!

26:45.417 --> 26:47.208
Pearls were added

26:45.417 --> 26:47.208
by Ferengi agents

26:47.250 --> 26:49.625
to increase

26:47.250 --> 26:49.625
the value.

26:49.667 --> 26:53.041
What is that?

26:53.083 --> 26:56.458
Something new

26:53.083 --> 26:56.458
and you didn't tell me.

26:56.500 --> 26:58.959
Mr. Data, I'm

26:56.500 --> 26:58.959
delighted to see

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
that you dressed

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
for the occasion.

27:04.250 --> 27:09.291
Say hello to my very

27:04.250 --> 27:09.291
good friend, Palor Toff.

27:14.125 --> 27:17.250
Uh...

27:17.291 --> 27:20.000
Data?

27:20.041 --> 27:22.041
Say hello.

27:22.083 --> 27:25.291
No need to be shy.

27:28.542 --> 27:31.959
It's a mannequin of some sort.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.125
This is not a mannequin,

27:32.000 --> 27:34.125
this is Data.

27:34.166 --> 27:35.750
This is formerly

27:34.166 --> 27:35.750
Lieutenant Commander Data

27:35.792 --> 27:37.125
of the Federation Starfleet.

27:37.166 --> 27:40.208
The only sentient android

27:37.166 --> 27:40.208
in existence.

27:40.250 --> 27:45.333
It doesn't seem

27:40.250 --> 27:45.333
particularly sentient right now.

27:45.375 --> 27:48.375
That's cause it's playing a

27:45.375 --> 27:48.375
stupid little game with us.

27:48.417 --> 27:51.709
Well, someone has certainly

27:48.417 --> 27:51.709
played a game on you, Fajo.

27:51.750 --> 27:54.083
I don't find this amusing.

27:54.125 --> 27:56.834
I demand

27:54.125 --> 27:56.834
that you behave normally.

28:01.750 --> 28:04.583
Behave... normally!

28:06.083 --> 28:08.083
I know you can hear me!

28:09.834 --> 28:11.709
He falls well.

28:11.750 --> 28:14.250
I apologize for this.

28:14.291 --> 28:16.291
Do not be upset,

28:14.291 --> 28:16.291
my friend.

28:16.333 --> 28:18.291
I'm having a delightful visit.

28:18.333 --> 28:20.709
Come along,

28:18.333 --> 28:20.709
Varria.

28:20.750 --> 28:21.834
You're much

28:20.750 --> 28:21.834
more fun

28:21.875 --> 28:24.625
than Fajo's new toy.

28:24.667 --> 28:25.917
You'll regret this.

28:34.500 --> 28:37.458
Now entering

28:34.500 --> 28:37.458
the Beta Agni system, sir.

28:37.500 --> 28:39.750
Half-impulse,

28:37.500 --> 28:39.750
Mr. Crusher.

28:39.792 --> 28:41.250
La Forge to bridge.

28:41.291 --> 28:42.583
Go ahead, Commander.

28:42.625 --> 28:45.166
Captain, a class-two probe

28:42.625 --> 28:45.166
has been loaded

28:45.208 --> 28:49.625
with the hytritium compound

28:45.208 --> 28:49.625
and is ready to launch.

28:49.667 --> 28:51.667
Now approaching Beta Agni Two,

28:49.667 --> 28:51.667
sir.

28:51.709 --> 28:54.125
Mr. Crusher, put us into close

28:51.709 --> 28:54.125
orbit.

28:54.166 --> 28:56.041
Mr. Data, scan...

29:02.375 --> 29:04.542
My apologies, Mr. Worf.

29:04.583 --> 29:07.917
Scan the colony's

29:04.583 --> 29:07.917
subsurface water.

29:07.959 --> 29:09.625
Scanning.

29:09.667 --> 29:11.667
Tricyanate contamination

29:09.667 --> 29:11.667
confirmed.

29:11.709 --> 29:15.166
Levels approaching

29:11.709 --> 29:15.166
42 parts per million.

29:15.208 --> 29:16.333
Area affected?

29:16.375 --> 29:17.625
30 square

29:16.375 --> 29:17.625
kilometers.

29:17.667 --> 29:19.333
Any indication of source?

29:19.375 --> 29:22.417
Highest concentration eight

29:19.375 --> 29:22.417
kilometers west of the colony.

29:22.458 --> 29:23.417
Adjust target coordinates.

29:23.458 --> 29:24.750
Aye, sir.

29:24.792 --> 29:26.083
La Forge to bridge.

29:26.125 --> 29:28.709
According to these figures,

29:26.125 --> 29:28.709
the 81 kilos

29:28.750 --> 29:31.458
of hytritium should be enough

29:28.750 --> 29:31.458
to neutralize the contamination.

29:31.500 --> 29:33.333
Now approaching target

29:31.500 --> 29:33.333
coordinates.

29:33.375 --> 29:34.709
Launch probe.

29:41.875 --> 29:43.917
Probe on target.

29:43.959 --> 29:46.542
Hytritium entering water table.

29:46.583 --> 29:51.166
Disbursement slightly

29:46.583 --> 29:51.166
faster than expected.

29:51.208 --> 29:54.917
Sir,

29:51.208 --> 29:54.917
something unusual.

29:54.959 --> 29:57.709
Specify.

29:57.750 --> 30:02.208
I'm getting concentrated

29:57.750 --> 30:02.208
tricyanate readings

30:02.250 --> 30:05.875
of 70 grams per cubic centimeter

30:02.250 --> 30:05.875
at the source coordinates--

30:05.917 --> 30:08.166
much higher than

30:05.917 --> 30:08.166
would normally occur.

30:08.208 --> 30:11.583
Computer, report on geological

30:08.208 --> 30:11.583
instability on Beta Agni Two.

30:11.625 --> 30:13.792
COMPUTER:

30:11.625 --> 30:13.792
No significant

30:11.625 --> 30:13.792
geological activity

30:13.834 --> 30:15.917
has been recorded

30:13.834 --> 30:15.917
on Beta Agni Two

30:15.959 --> 30:18.500
since the settlement of the

30:15.959 --> 30:18.500
Federation colony.

30:18.542 --> 30:22.291
Number One, perhaps you better

30:18.542 --> 30:22.291
take an away team down and have

30:18.542 --> 30:22.291
a closer look.

30:22.333 --> 30:23.625
Aye, sir.

30:23.667 --> 30:25.083
Dr. Crusher, join me

30:23.667 --> 30:25.083
in transporter room three.

30:25.125 --> 30:26.166
BEVERLY:

30:25.125 --> 30:26.166
On my way.

30:26.208 --> 30:27.709
Mr. Worf.

30:49.792 --> 30:56.208
I would very much like our

30:49.792 --> 30:56.208
relationship to...change.

30:56.250 --> 30:58.834
You may expect me to use every

30:56.250 --> 30:58.834
means at my disposal

30:58.875 --> 31:00.166
to resist your wishes.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.375
Why couldn't you just comply?

31:03.417 --> 31:06.166
Why do you have to argue

31:03.417 --> 31:06.166
all the time?

31:06.208 --> 31:08.709
Couldn't you just go sit

31:06.208 --> 31:08.709
on the chair?

31:10.792 --> 31:14.792
Come on, go sit on the chair.

31:14.834 --> 31:17.291
I do not intend to sit

31:14.834 --> 31:17.291
in the chair.

31:17.333 --> 31:19.417
You will.

31:19.458 --> 31:22.041
You may not believe it

31:19.458 --> 31:22.041
right now,

31:22.083 --> 31:24.667
but you will.

31:28.875 --> 31:29.875
Oh...

31:38.458 --> 31:41.709
Have you ever seen

31:38.458 --> 31:41.709
one of these, Data?

31:41.750 --> 31:43.375
It is a disrupter.

31:43.417 --> 31:48.208
Well...no, it's a prototype

31:43.417 --> 31:48.208
for a Varon-T disrupter.

31:48.250 --> 31:51.709
The Varon-T disrupter is banned

31:48.250 --> 31:51.709
in the Federation.

31:51.750 --> 31:54.667
Oh, yes, they only manufactured

31:51.750 --> 31:54.667
five of them. I own four.

31:54.709 --> 31:57.250
I sleep with one under my pillow

31:54.709 --> 31:57.250
at night, and I sleep very well

31:57.291 --> 31:58.959
knowing it's there, too.

31:59.000 --> 31:59.959
Do you know why?

32:00.000 --> 32:02.041
It is a most lethal weapon.

32:02.083 --> 32:05.792
It's not just lethal, it's...

32:05.834 --> 32:07.834
it's vicious.

32:07.875 --> 32:10.333
It tears a body apart,

32:07.875 --> 32:10.333
inside-out,

32:10.375 --> 32:13.542
and does it very slowly, too,

32:10.375 --> 32:13.542
by your phaser standards.

32:13.583 --> 32:20.375
It's a tortuous, very...

32:13.583 --> 32:20.375
very painful death.

32:20.417 --> 32:22.208
I've always wanted to try this.

32:22.250 --> 32:24.375
It is doubtful

32:22.250 --> 32:24.375
you will destroy me

32:24.417 --> 32:27.083
since you assign so much value

32:24.417 --> 32:27.083
to possessing me.

32:27.125 --> 32:29.667
That goes without saying.

32:33.083 --> 32:36.500
Please come in.

32:36.542 --> 32:41.166
Varria, how long have we

32:36.542 --> 32:41.166
been together, my dear?

32:41.208 --> 32:43.125
14 years.

32:43.166 --> 32:45.500
14 wonderful years

32:43.166 --> 32:45.500
they were, too.

32:45.542 --> 32:49.166
She was barely an adult

32:45.542 --> 32:49.166
when I found her.

32:49.208 --> 32:51.625
She was idealistic,

32:51.667 --> 32:53.959
naive and full of dreams

32:54.000 --> 32:56.750
and I made those dreams come

32:54.000 --> 32:56.750
true, too, didn't I?

32:56.792 --> 33:00.166
I'm going to miss you.

33:04.333 --> 33:06.166
DATA:

33:04.333 --> 33:06.166
Fajo.

33:27.041 --> 33:30.250
The contamination

33:27.041 --> 33:30.250
has been neutralized.

33:30.291 --> 33:31.250
The water is clean.

33:31.291 --> 33:33.041
WORF:

33:31.291 --> 33:33.041
Curious.

33:33.083 --> 33:36.083
The process of neutralization

33:33.083 --> 33:36.083
should have taken several hours.

33:36.125 --> 33:42.166
Naturally-occurring tricyanate

33:36.125 --> 33:42.166
does not respond this quickly.

33:42.208 --> 33:45.959
Are you saying

33:42.208 --> 33:45.959
it's not naturally occurring?

33:46.000 --> 33:48.417
There are no natural

33:46.000 --> 33:48.417
trace elements present

33:48.458 --> 33:50.000
in these tricyanate crystals.

33:50.041 --> 33:52.083
If it's artificial then we're

33:50.041 --> 33:52.083
talking about sabotage.

33:52.125 --> 33:54.083
BEVERLY:

33:52.125 --> 33:54.083
With tricyanate?

33:54.125 --> 33:55.709
That's hard to believe.

33:55.750 --> 33:59.083
It's slow to assimilate,

33:55.750 --> 33:59.083
difficult to replicate

33:59.125 --> 34:01.500
and hard to transport.

34:01.542 --> 34:05.125
There are a lot easier ways

34:01.542 --> 34:05.125
to poison a water supply.

34:05.166 --> 34:07.542
More effective ways, too.

34:07.583 --> 34:09.291
Can you think of any reason a

34:07.583 --> 34:09.291
saboteur

34:09.333 --> 34:10.750
would choose tricyanate?

34:10.792 --> 34:14.875
It might pass

34:10.792 --> 34:14.875
for a natural disaster.

34:14.917 --> 34:18.834
And since there's only one way

34:14.917 --> 34:18.834
to treat it, with hytritium,

34:18.875 --> 34:22.333
maybe somebody figured

34:18.875 --> 34:22.333
we couldn't locate it.

34:22.375 --> 34:23.792
It is hard to find.

34:23.834 --> 34:25.959
Then it really was

34:23.834 --> 34:25.959
lucky, wasn't it?

34:26.000 --> 34:28.333
That we were able to find

34:26.000 --> 34:28.333
hytritium when we did.

34:28.375 --> 34:31.500
And just enough hytritium

34:28.375 --> 34:31.500
for this crisis.

34:34.083 --> 34:37.542
Fajo was in the right place

34:34.083 --> 34:37.542
at the right time,

34:34.083 --> 34:37.542
just when we needed him most.

34:37.583 --> 34:40.583
Are you suggesting he created

34:37.583 --> 34:40.583
the problem just to solve it?

34:40.625 --> 34:41.750
Possibly.

34:41.792 --> 34:43.083
LA FORGE:

34:41.792 --> 34:43.083
What, to make a profit

34:43.125 --> 34:44.542
from his sale of hytritium?

34:44.583 --> 34:46.041
It doesn't add up.

34:46.083 --> 34:48.542
The cost of producing tricyanate

34:46.083 --> 34:48.542
is very expensive.

34:48.583 --> 34:50.667
He wouldn't make a profit on it.

34:50.709 --> 34:52.166
Quite the contrary.

34:52.208 --> 34:54.250
Then why would he do it?

34:54.291 --> 34:56.125
What did he want?

34:57.792 --> 35:01.333
Computer, biographical file

34:57.792 --> 35:01.333
on trader Kivas Fajo.

35:01.375 --> 35:03.125
COMPUTER:

35:01.375 --> 35:03.125
Accessing file.

35:03.166 --> 35:07.333
Kivas Fajo, a Zibalian trader

35:03.166 --> 35:07.333
of the Stacius trade guild

35:07.375 --> 35:09.083
educated on Iraatin Five.

35:09.125 --> 35:12.083
A noted collector

35:09.125 --> 35:12.083
of rare and valuable objects

35:12.125 --> 35:13.667
including the Rejac crystal,

35:13.709 --> 35:16.125
the<i> Starry Night</i> by Vincent

35:13.709 --> 35:16.125
Van Gogh,

35:16.166 --> 35:18.417
the Lawmin galactopedia,

35:18.458 --> 35:19.834
the Malia Manda tapestry...

35:19.875 --> 35:21.041
Computer, that is sufficient.

35:21.083 --> 35:23.417
A rare and valuable object.

35:23.458 --> 35:26.166
What if Data

35:23.458 --> 35:26.166
wasn't on that shuttle?

35:26.208 --> 35:27.500
Mr. Crusher.

35:27.542 --> 35:29.417
CRUSHER:

35:27.542 --> 35:29.417
Aye, sir.

35:29.458 --> 35:31.667
Set course for the site

35:29.458 --> 35:31.667
of the shuttlepod explosion.

35:29.458 --> 35:31.667
Warp eight.

35:31.709 --> 35:32.917
Aye, sir.

35:36.750 --> 35:40.125
The<i> Jovis</i> has a maximum speed

35:36.750 --> 35:40.125
of warp three.

35:40.166 --> 35:41.583
He's had 23 hours.

35:41.625 --> 35:45.583
So we can define a perimeter

35:41.625 --> 35:45.583
of .102 light-years

35:45.625 --> 35:46.917
as his possible distance

35:45.625 --> 35:46.917
distance.

35:46.959 --> 35:49.000
Fajo doesn't know that

35:46.959 --> 35:49.000
we're onto him.

35:49.041 --> 35:53.417
So he probably isn't taxing

35:49.041 --> 35:53.417
his engines top speed.

35:53.458 --> 35:55.542
He could have made it

35:53.458 --> 35:55.542
to the Nel Bato system

35:55.583 --> 35:57.917
or maybe even the Giles belt.

35:57.959 --> 35:59.750
He's a trader.

35:59.792 --> 36:02.208
He doesn't attract customers

35:59.792 --> 36:02.208
by being hard to find.

36:02.250 --> 36:04.917
We could put out a coded Level

36:02.250 --> 36:04.917
Two query to all Federation

36:02.250 --> 36:04.917
outposts

36:04.959 --> 36:06.375
within the perimeter.

36:06.417 --> 36:08.333
Make it so.

36:24.125 --> 36:29.417
If I help you escape,

36:24.125 --> 36:29.417
will you take me with you?

36:29.458 --> 36:30.959
He's sleeping.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
And there isn't

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
much time.

36:33.041 --> 36:34.750
The consequences

36:33.041 --> 36:34.750
if we are caught...

36:34.792 --> 36:37.417
I know

36:34.792 --> 36:37.417
the consequences.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.333
14 years...

36:42.375 --> 36:44.959
you learn a few things.

36:46.959 --> 36:50.166
There's an escape pod

36:46.959 --> 36:50.166
in the aft cargo bay.

36:59.750 --> 37:04.333
Captain, affirmative response

36:59.750 --> 37:04.333
from station Lya-Four.

37:06.834 --> 37:09.834
Fajo spent more than

37:06.834 --> 37:09.834
half a day in orbit.

37:09.875 --> 37:12.291
Departed just over

37:09.875 --> 37:12.291
seven hours ago.

37:12.333 --> 37:14.250
Mr. Crusher, new coordinates.

37:14.291 --> 37:16.417
Lay in a course for Lya-Four.

37:16.458 --> 37:18.125
Course already

37:16.458 --> 37:18.125
laid in, sir.

37:22.250 --> 37:26.041
Perhaps I should attempt

37:22.250 --> 37:26.041
to communicate

37:22.250 --> 37:26.041
with the<i> Enterprise.</i>

37:26.083 --> 37:27.583
You can't.

37:27.625 --> 37:30.917
Fajo has communications access

37:27.625 --> 37:30.917
restricted to the bridge.

37:30.959 --> 37:34.625
Once we're out,

37:30.959 --> 37:34.625
the shuttle pod will emit

37:30.959 --> 37:34.625
an emergency beacon.

37:34.667 --> 37:36.875
We'll just have to hope

37:34.667 --> 37:36.875
somebody responds

37:36.917 --> 37:39.000
before Fajo is able

37:36.917 --> 37:39.000
to destroy us.

37:39.041 --> 37:41.166
I am trained

37:39.041 --> 37:41.166
in evasive maneuvers.

37:41.208 --> 37:43.667
We'll need a few.

37:43.709 --> 37:45.417
Let's get going.

37:46.959 --> 37:50.083
As soon as I start

37:46.959 --> 37:50.083
the escape sequence

37:50.125 --> 37:51.500
an alarm will sound.

37:51.542 --> 37:54.875
We won't have much time.

38:07.417 --> 38:11.208
(<i> alarm siren</i> )

38:21.625 --> 38:22.959
VARRIA:

38:21.625 --> 38:22.959
Oh, no!

39:37.458 --> 39:40.375
(<i> screaming</i> )

39:47.625 --> 39:50.041
It's your fault.

39:50.083 --> 39:52.667
You knew the price

39:50.083 --> 39:52.667
for disobedience.

39:52.709 --> 39:54.917
And so did she.

39:58.458 --> 40:01.917
Well, there's always

39:58.458 --> 40:01.917
another Varria.

40:19.375 --> 40:21.875
You won't hurt me.

40:21.917 --> 40:25.125
"Fundamental respect

40:21.917 --> 40:25.125
for all living beings."

40:25.166 --> 40:28.750
That's what you said.

40:28.792 --> 40:30.625
I'm a living being.

40:30.667 --> 40:33.083
Therefore, you can't harm me.

40:33.125 --> 40:36.625
You will surrender yourself

40:33.125 --> 40:36.625
to the authorities.

40:36.667 --> 40:39.792
Or what?

40:36.667 --> 40:39.792
You'll fire?

40:39.834 --> 40:42.583
Empty threat

40:39.834 --> 40:42.583
and we both know it.

40:42.625 --> 40:45.083
Why don't you

40:42.625 --> 40:45.083
accept your fate?

40:45.125 --> 40:46.959
You'll return

40:45.125 --> 40:46.959
to your chair

40:47.000 --> 40:48.709
and you will

40:47.000 --> 40:48.709
sit there.

40:48.750 --> 40:51.333
You will entertain me and you

40:48.750 --> 40:51.333
will entertain my guests.

40:51.375 --> 40:52.583
And if you don't,

40:52.625 --> 40:54.750
I'll simply kill

40:52.625 --> 40:54.750
someone else.

40:54.792 --> 40:57.166
Him, perhaps.

40:57.208 --> 40:59.458
Doesn't matter.

40:59.500 --> 41:01.000
Their blood will be

40:59.500 --> 41:01.000
on your hands, too,

41:01.041 --> 41:04.333
just like poor Varria's.

41:04.375 --> 41:07.500
Your only

41:04.375 --> 41:07.500
alternative, Data,

41:07.542 --> 41:10.041
is to fire.

41:10.083 --> 41:12.333
Murder me.

41:12.375 --> 41:13.667
That's all you have to do.

41:13.709 --> 41:17.250
Go ahead, fire.

41:17.291 --> 41:24.500
If only you could feel rage

41:17.291 --> 41:24.500
over Varria's death.

41:24.542 --> 41:28.542
If only you could feel

41:24.542 --> 41:28.542
a need for revenge,

41:28.583 --> 41:31.667
then maybe you could fire.

41:31.709 --> 41:35.041
But you're just an android.

41:35.083 --> 41:37.625
You can't feel

41:35.083 --> 41:37.625
anything, can you?

41:37.667 --> 41:41.959
It's just another interesting

41:37.667 --> 41:41.959
intellectual puzzle for you,

41:42.000 --> 41:46.625
another of life's curiosities.

41:46.667 --> 41:53.500
I cannot permit this

41:46.667 --> 41:53.500
to continue.

41:53.542 --> 41:56.750
Wait, your program

41:53.542 --> 41:56.750
won't allow you to fire.

41:56.792 --> 41:58.333
You can't fire.

41:58.375 --> 41:59.750
No.

42:05.125 --> 42:08.125
I'm reading a weapon

42:05.125 --> 42:08.125
in transit with commander Data.

42:08.166 --> 42:10.333
It seems to have

42:08.166 --> 42:10.333
discharged, sir.

42:10.375 --> 42:12.375
Discharged?

42:12.417 --> 42:14.333
I'm deactivating it.

42:23.917 --> 42:26.333
Welcome back, Mr. Data.

42:26.375 --> 42:28.041
Are you all right?

42:28.083 --> 42:29.500
Yes, Commander.

42:29.542 --> 42:33.041
Please arrange to have

42:29.542 --> 42:33.041
Kivas Fajo taken into custody

42:33.083 --> 42:36.709
on charges of murder,

42:33.083 --> 42:36.709
kidnapping, theft...

42:36.750 --> 42:39.166
The arrangements have

42:36.750 --> 42:39.166
already been made.

42:41.625 --> 42:45.417
A Varon-T disrupter.

42:45.458 --> 42:47.333
It belongs to Fajo.

42:47.375 --> 42:50.834
Mr. O'Brien says the weapon was

42:47.375 --> 42:50.834
in a state of discharge.

42:53.959 --> 42:57.959
Perhaps something occurred

42:53.959 --> 42:57.959
during transport, Commander.

43:17.542 --> 43:22.250
Oh, have you come

43:17.542 --> 43:22.250
to see me repent?

43:22.291 --> 43:25.375
Your final satisfaction?

43:25.417 --> 43:28.792
Want to see me

43:25.417 --> 43:28.792
beg for mercy?

43:28.834 --> 43:31.875
You're not going to get

43:28.834 --> 43:31.875
any of that from me.

43:31.917 --> 43:34.417
I expected nothing.

43:34.458 --> 43:39.125
Our roles are reversed.

43:39.166 --> 43:42.375
Aren't they, Data?

43:42.417 --> 43:43.458
You're the collector now.

43:43.500 --> 43:49.166
Me, I'm in a cage.

43:49.208 --> 43:50.750
So it seems.

43:50.792 --> 43:52.625
Don't count me out

43:50.792 --> 43:52.625
too quickly.

43:52.667 --> 43:53.875
I had you in my collection once.

43:53.917 --> 43:55.834
I can have you there again.

43:55.875 --> 43:58.125
Unlikely, sir.

43:59.959 --> 44:04.500
Your collection

43:59.959 --> 44:04.500
has been confiscated.

44:04.542 --> 44:06.083
All of your stolen possessions

44:06.125 --> 44:09.583
are being returned

44:06.125 --> 44:09.583
to their rightful owners.

44:09.625 --> 44:12.458
You have lost everything

44:09.625 --> 44:12.458
you value.

44:12.500 --> 44:15.166
That must give you

44:12.500 --> 44:15.166
great pleasure.

44:15.208 --> 44:20.667
No, sir, it does not.

44:20.709 --> 44:23.667
I do not feel pleasure.

44:23.709 --> 44:26.625
I am only an android.
