01:34.440 --> 01:35.560
Maddy, not at the table.

01:43.090 --> 01:45.000
Stop it, it's rude.

01:47.350 --> 01:49.670
It's only rude if I'm
interrupting something.

01:49.940 --> 01:51.910
Conversation, family discourse.

01:51.920 --> 01:53.500
Nobody's said anything for ten minutes.

01:55.610 --> 01:56.830
They're changing colour.

01:58.250 --> 01:59.270
The bruises.

02:00.150 --> 02:01.460
It means they're healing.

02:02.370 --> 02:03.780
Maybe on the outside.

02:04.730 --> 02:07.100
The injuries could have
cause a thromboembolism.

02:09.389 --> 02:10.350
My son,

02:10.870 --> 02:11.800
the doctor.

02:38.100 --> 02:39.550
What's that all about?

02:40.590 --> 02:43.380
I don't know how thrilled I am
having my ten-year-old son

02:43.500 --> 02:45.360
sit opposite his badly beaten uncle,

02:45.400 --> 02:47.340
commenting on the severity of his injuries,

02:47.350 --> 02:49.880
and not being the slightest bit
disturbed by it.

02:51.730 --> 02:53.390
Tell me, when did that become normal

02:53.400 --> 02:54.410
or acceptable?

02:55.880 --> 02:56.670
That's over.

02:57.350 --> 02:58.450
Everything is dealt with.

02:58.750 --> 03:00.130
Should I trust you on that?

03:03.900 --> 03:05.650
You wouldn't lie to me, would you?

03:07.760 --> 03:08.930
Of course not.

03:40.060 --> 03:42.310
He's leaving for a job
in about ten minutes.

03:43.500 --> 03:44.310
Are you busy?

03:44.570 --> 03:46.500
No, there's nobody else here.

03:46.510 --> 03:48.880
Look, Julie, you can't keep phoning me.

03:48.890 --> 03:49.910
I'm coming in.

03:55.220 --> 03:57.310
There's a message from Padraig.

03:57.320 --> 03:58.620
The North Circular is a bitch,

03:58.640 --> 04:00.300
so him and Rosie will meet you there.

04:00.420 --> 04:01.220
That's fine.

04:06.370 --> 04:07.380
Look, we're...

04:08.060 --> 04:09.210
we're in the black.

04:10.300 --> 04:13.550
Not by much, maybe we could
stop the off the record jobs.

04:14.600 --> 04:16.779
Yeah, I'll make sure
to suggest that to them.

04:29.480 --> 04:30.460
Maddy, please.

04:31.490 --> 04:32.260
I'm OK.

04:32.560 --> 04:34.430
Think of it as palliative care.

04:35.250 --> 04:37.550
Though you could at least
put your hand in your pocket.

04:37.740 --> 04:38.840
Minimum wage?

04:38.870 --> 04:40.180
For what? For folding clothes?

04:41.220 --> 04:44.160
There are girls half your age on the
other side of the world making them.

04:44.200 --> 04:45.530
All hardship is relative.

04:47.230 --> 04:48.550
Well, leave me alone, please.

04:57.800 --> 04:59.280
How do you get someone to like you?

05:01.520 --> 05:02.110
Well...

05:02.550 --> 05:03.410
you can't.

05:06.070 --> 05:07.110
Is there a boy?

05:08.410 --> 05:09.000
No.

05:12.050 --> 05:12.770
Maybe.

05:14.500 --> 05:15.940
Well, you have to...

05:17.730 --> 05:20.100
you have to become irresistible

05:20.880 --> 05:21.940
by being

05:22.380 --> 05:23.330
unavailable.

05:23.860 --> 05:24.570
Easy.

05:25.380 --> 05:26.530
He looks right through me.

05:36.520 --> 05:38.460
Wanting something you can't have

05:39.280 --> 05:40.290
can be painful.

05:41.340 --> 05:42.190
Especially when

05:42.200 --> 05:43.490
everybody else has it

05:43.900 --> 05:45.030
without even trying.

05:46.930 --> 05:48.060
But if it hurts,

05:48.790 --> 05:49.740
that's life.

05:53.770 --> 05:55.630
<u>Three Colors: Blue</u> is on Catch-Up.

05:56.330 --> 05:58.580
It's French. Might make you feel better.

05:59.240 --> 06:00.800
It's not exactly a comedy.

06:01.720 --> 06:03.500
But all right.
Let's what it and cry together.

06:03.780 --> 06:04.820
Go get the tissues.

06:10.040 --> 06:11.390
Is the business in trouble?

06:12.710 --> 06:14.010
Not that I'm aware of.

06:14.560 --> 06:15.990
Currently running at profit.

06:17.850 --> 06:19.250
Something's going on.

06:19.600 --> 06:21.150
Secret bank accounts,

06:21.870 --> 06:22.880
hidden mortgages.

06:24.960 --> 06:26.450
Come on, you're his right arm.

06:27.370 --> 06:29.300
Nothing happens here
that you don't know about.

06:33.260 --> 06:34.860
I know you care about him.

06:40.540 --> 06:42.000
There's a second book.

06:43.450 --> 06:44.410
I've been running

06:44.660 --> 06:45.890
two jobs diaries.

06:46.100 --> 06:47.390
For tax purposes?

06:50.830 --> 06:51.920
Well, who are these jobs for?

06:51.930 --> 06:54.760
It's for clients who can't
go through the usual channels.

06:55.070 --> 06:55.960
Criminal?

06:58.530 --> 06:59.480
Is he in trouble?

07:03.490 --> 07:05.060
Right. This stops, now.

07:05.070 --> 07:06.630
I don't think he can.

07:07.870 --> 07:09.350
I need to know what we're dealing with.

07:11.190 --> 07:12.300
Show me the other book.

07:27.220 --> 07:28.220
Estonian.

07:28.900 --> 07:30.160
Lithuanian maybe.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.360
One night stand?

07:31.880 --> 07:33.120
She's still at mine now.

07:33.710 --> 07:34.720
Waiting.

07:34.990 --> 07:37.520
You should be careful
with Lithuanian girls.

07:37.600 --> 07:39.160
Especially dirty, are they?

07:39.330 --> 07:41.970
They come to London to
get especially pregnant.

07:42.300 --> 07:43.430
Any details?

07:43.690 --> 07:45.370
Not much. Domestic I think.

07:46.010 --> 07:46.520
Right.

07:55.440 --> 07:56.540
I didn't use a condom.

07:56.790 --> 07:57.820
She had it covered.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.390
I don't often get the
chance to go bareback.

08:01.270 --> 08:02.120
What do you think?

08:02.540 --> 08:03.430
He did her,

08:03.500 --> 08:05.260
then himself maybe.

08:05.270 --> 08:06.420
First one here,

08:06.890 --> 08:08.010
the second one here.

08:08.050 --> 08:08.880
Hey, Charlie.

08:09.510 --> 08:10.320
It's all right, John?

08:10.590 --> 08:11.190
No,

08:11.440 --> 08:12.910
this wasn't domestic.

08:13.360 --> 08:15.540
There's not enough blood
for a crime of passion.

08:16.480 --> 08:18.040
Too much mess. People...

08:18.160 --> 08:20.010
tend not to break their own possessions.

08:20.080 --> 08:21.340
Doesn't have to be passion.

08:21.460 --> 08:23.500
Some couples grow to hate each other.

08:25.670 --> 08:26.960
This wasn't robbery.

08:27.410 --> 08:28.890
- It was a double murder.
- Hmm.

08:34.210 --> 08:35.030
Was there kids?

08:35.280 --> 08:35.870
Three.

08:36.340 --> 08:37.390
They're with family.

08:38.330 --> 08:39.210
Turf war.

08:39.450 --> 08:41.799
Proper "send out a message" assassination.

08:41.799 --> 08:43.429
Then trash the place out of spite.

08:44.090 --> 08:46.120
Well, the sooner we start,
the sooner we're done.

08:46.760 --> 08:47.690
Right.

09:23.660 --> 09:24.590
Come with me.

09:25.630 --> 09:27.640
Don't point this fucking thing at me.

09:44.160 --> 09:44.810
Sit.

09:58.140 --> 10:00.330
It was quite a mess you had
to clean out this morning.

10:01.200 --> 10:02.020
Horrific...

10:02.250 --> 10:02.960
even.

10:04.660 --> 10:05.700
Husband and wife,

10:07.040 --> 10:09.240
shot at point-blank range.

10:10.940 --> 10:11.740
You did it?

10:13.230 --> 10:14.940
They were family, you prick!

10:15.510 --> 10:16.720
It was his brother, Veysel.

10:17.690 --> 10:18.730
I don't know who that is.

10:18.850 --> 10:19.830
You've heard the name.

10:20.580 --> 10:22.880
You were present at the
death of Frank McElroy.

10:24.360 --> 10:25.280
Why am I here?

10:25.970 --> 10:26.990
You have a brother.

10:27.640 --> 10:28.500
Martin?

10:29.500 --> 10:30.880
Veysel saved his life.

10:31.650 --> 10:33.690
Dealt with two associates from his past,

10:33.810 --> 10:34.910
from France.

10:35.560 --> 10:37.350
Your brother made promises.

10:37.860 --> 10:38.810
So far,

10:39.040 --> 10:40.440
hasn't delivered on any of them.

10:41.710 --> 10:43.080
What promises?

10:43.340 --> 10:44.430
Nelson Clay.

10:49.170 --> 10:50.420
It's clear my brother's murder

10:50.430 --> 10:52.330
was carried out by Nelson Clay

10:52.790 --> 10:54.210
or his employees.

10:54.790 --> 10:56.350
Old school warning shot.

10:56.360 --> 10:58.990
And the easiest thing to
do would be to retaliate.

10:59.220 --> 11:00.820
We butcher one of Nelson's men,

11:00.860 --> 11:02.950
he kills one of ours. Tit for tat.

11:03.400 --> 11:05.430
Who benefits from a personal feud?

11:05.460 --> 11:06.890
It's the 21st century.

11:07.900 --> 11:08.860
You're close

11:09.200 --> 11:10.280
to Nelson Clay.

11:10.490 --> 11:12.010
Not when it comes to his business.

11:12.010 --> 11:13.660
Well, your brother seems to think you are.

11:14.500 --> 11:16.670
Claims he relies on
you to make all kinds of

11:16.680 --> 11:17.660
problems

11:17.880 --> 11:18.700
disappear.

11:22.750 --> 11:24.800
We'll need to stay in
constant communication.

11:26.720 --> 11:28.450
I want Nelson's contacts,

11:28.500 --> 11:30.510
his deals, drop points,

11:30.550 --> 11:31.350
dates,

11:31.400 --> 11:32.810
his patch covering Vauxhall,

11:33.240 --> 11:35.960
primary locations, addresses, dealers...

11:35.960 --> 11:38.180
I can't get you that kind of information.

11:39.300 --> 11:40.830
It's what my brother expected

11:42.850 --> 11:44.060
what your brother

11:44.550 --> 11:45.410
promised.

11:47.880 --> 11:48.990
It's just business.

11:54.180 --> 11:55.690
You work for me, now.

12:03.110 --> 12:04.100
A "skin flick"?

12:05.340 --> 12:06.550
You don't know what that is.

12:06.770 --> 12:08.440
Yeah, it's a porn film.

12:08.560 --> 12:10.520
No! A naked selfie.

12:10.760 --> 12:13.190
For girls, top off only, no face.

12:13.530 --> 12:14.080
What?

12:14.610 --> 12:16.300
Boys collect the pictures on their phones,

12:16.680 --> 12:18.730
sometimes they swap them
without the girls knowing.

12:19.190 --> 12:21.100
They play a game, "Guess Whose Rack?"

12:26.160 --> 12:27.190
You're not serious?

12:27.760 --> 12:29.280
That's just how it is.

12:29.710 --> 12:30.350
Maddy,

12:30.960 --> 12:31.880
you're so pretty.

12:32.110 --> 12:34.080
I don't want you to let anyone

12:34.330 --> 12:36.440
especially a spotty-face kid,

12:37.040 --> 12:38.380
make you think otherwise.

12:39.480 --> 12:41.190
There's a party. Mom says I can go.

12:42.300 --> 12:43.500
I dunno if I want to.

12:43.680 --> 12:44.170
Well...

12:44.910 --> 12:46.080
you're going to go.

12:47.470 --> 12:48.100
And...

12:48.600 --> 12:49.950
You're not gonna try to fit in.

12:50.340 --> 12:51.530
You're not gonna be a sheep.

12:51.690 --> 12:53.000
You're gonna be a lioness.

12:53.070 --> 12:54.180
Strut your stuff...

12:54.300 --> 12:55.700
Shake your tail feathers...

12:56.170 --> 12:57.260
Make them notice.

12:57.460 --> 12:58.120
And...

12:59.020 --> 13:00.420
You're going to buy

13:00.760 --> 13:02.230
yourself something

13:02.390 --> 13:03.290
knock-out.

13:03.770 --> 13:06.040
Don't be a sheep.
Be a lion with a peacock's tail,

13:06.050 --> 13:07.730
and go shopping. That's your advice?

13:08.120 --> 13:10.450
Yeah, and if you don't like it,
give me my money back.

13:11.420 --> 13:13.800
I'd enjoy myself just as much
staying here with you, you know?

13:14.880 --> 13:15.580
I know.

13:16.350 --> 13:17.360
I'm wonderful.

13:17.930 --> 13:18.880
Off you go.

13:44.560 --> 13:45.790
And there's me

13:45.910 --> 13:47.760
thinking we were exclusive.

13:56.470 --> 13:57.600
I had no idea.

13:58.130 --> 13:59.430
It's the first time I've met them.

13:59.930 --> 14:01.490
I didn't bring them into this.

14:01.540 --> 14:03.020
Not personally, no.

14:03.640 --> 14:06.640
Your brother hasn't been shy
in offering all kinds of help.

14:07.360 --> 14:10.030
They helped him out,
with those guys you threatened me with.

14:11.200 --> 14:12.480
Romain and Nico,

14:12.600 --> 14:13.850
from Saint-Nazaire?

14:15.400 --> 14:16.720
Pair of charmers.

14:17.080 --> 14:18.740
Heard they're no longer with us.

14:19.720 --> 14:21.100
How do you know all this stuff?

14:21.110 --> 14:22.800
It's my business to know.

14:23.560 --> 14:25.670
Information is currency.

14:26.160 --> 14:29.220
Your Turkish friends know that.
That's why they tapped up Frank,

14:29.430 --> 14:31.170
and now your brother.

14:31.470 --> 14:32.610
Still...

14:32.980 --> 14:34.800
Let's say no more about it.

14:35.510 --> 14:37.460
Our Turkish brethren...

14:38.680 --> 14:40.500
a thing of the past.

14:45.670 --> 14:48.250
But if I find out you're in contact,

14:48.370 --> 14:49.790
in person,

14:49.910 --> 14:51.380
or by phone,

14:51.900 --> 14:55.550
or you get so much as a
craving for a shish kebab,

14:56.550 --> 14:58.060
I will end you.

15:03.500 --> 15:04.450
Oh,

15:06.840 --> 15:07.770
Him...

15:09.700 --> 15:11.480
Get your house in order.

15:35.900 --> 15:37.290
Veysel Kisa.

15:37.580 --> 15:39.010
Mean anything to you?

15:40.090 --> 15:41.940
I was going to tell you.

15:42.220 --> 15:43.630
Doesn't matter now.

15:44.010 --> 15:45.370
Veysel's dead.

15:46.920 --> 15:48.050
His wife too.

15:49.010 --> 15:50.370
Nelson ordered it.

16:07.060 --> 16:09.590
A guy called Hakan...

16:11.350 --> 16:12.650
this morning,

16:15.770 --> 16:17.570
put a gun to my head,

16:18.580 --> 16:21.360
took me to meet Veysel's brother.

16:23.700 --> 16:25.040
Claims you made a deal?

16:25.060 --> 16:26.740
I... I didn't have a choice.

16:34.440 --> 16:36.890
They're expecting us to work for them.

16:37.600 --> 16:38.590
Bring them everything

16:38.600 --> 16:40.310
- about Nelson's business.
- What do you want me to do?

16:40.310 --> 16:41.310
I tried to help you.

16:41.540 --> 16:42.990
OK? I'm sorry.

16:44.350 --> 16:45.600
It's what happens, isn't it?

16:47.310 --> 16:49.880
Since the beginning, since we were kids.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.290
Every day brought something else,

16:54.090 --> 16:56.510
always worse than what came before.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.200
Until this.

17:05.400 --> 17:06.609
Two phones.

17:08.530 --> 17:09.829
Two bosses.

17:12.050 --> 17:13.089
No way out.

17:14.740 --> 17:16.060
Except there is.

17:18.829 --> 17:20.859
I'm going to see DCI Squire.

17:25.700 --> 17:26.950
There's a film.

17:28.190 --> 17:29.500
Belonged to Kendrick.

17:29.540 --> 17:30.690
He kept it hidden.

17:30.810 --> 17:31.870
What's in this film?

17:33.630 --> 17:34.670
Nelson...

17:36.670 --> 17:38.610
doing what Nelson does.

17:41.870 --> 17:43.180
Killing a man.

17:44.240 --> 17:45.750
Torching his body.

17:46.650 --> 17:47.870
Where is this film?

17:50.940 --> 17:52.180
Somewhere safe.

17:54.620 --> 17:56.270
A place no one knows about.

18:01.070 --> 18:02.250
Everyone

18:03.330 --> 18:05.420
I know who trusted a cop,

18:05.880 --> 18:07.200
is either dead,

18:07.470 --> 18:08.530
or in jail.

18:10.980 --> 18:12.560
What choice do I have?

18:12.680 --> 18:13.850
You can leave.

18:14.340 --> 18:16.260
You take your family, and you go.

18:16.380 --> 18:19.320
Forget about the house,
forget about the business.

18:20.410 --> 18:21.740
You said it yourself,

18:21.760 --> 18:23.370
the bank owns everything.

18:25.850 --> 18:27.720
I don't think the family would come.

18:33.180 --> 18:34.820
Julie knows something.

18:35.430 --> 18:36.340
About what?

18:36.730 --> 18:38.940
About this business? The money?

18:41.770 --> 18:43.200
Or about your girlfriend?

18:47.850 --> 18:49.730
I don't have a girlfriend.

18:50.570 --> 18:52.530
Sure you do. And I don't judge you.

18:52.550 --> 18:53.740
It is what it is.

19:02.050 --> 19:03.130
What's going on?

19:04.950 --> 19:06.040
Van trouble.

19:06.240 --> 19:09.130
I lost the keys again. And...

19:09.300 --> 19:10.950
You know, how I am.

19:11.200 --> 19:12.950
I keep forgetting things.

19:14.900 --> 19:15.940
It's fine.

19:31.060 --> 19:32.700
You have a lot to lose.

19:39.070 --> 19:40.530
You're a big help.

20:12.880 --> 20:16.300
I'm a little surprised to see
you again so soon, Mr Bastière.

20:19.560 --> 20:22.360
Is there something specific
I can help you with?

20:24.730 --> 20:28.280
In here, is everything
you'll ever need on Nelson Clay.

20:30.250 --> 20:32.830
Evidence linking him to drug deals,

20:32.840 --> 20:35.230
extortion, blackmail, murder.

20:35.430 --> 20:37.700
- What evidence?
- I'll need reinsurances.

20:38.510 --> 20:40.640
I want protection for me and my family.

20:41.150 --> 20:42.770
Relocation, somewhere far.

20:42.950 --> 20:44.510
Maybe the States or Canada.

20:44.860 --> 20:46.500
Immunity from prosecution.

20:46.530 --> 20:49.270
Did you participate
in any criminal activity?

20:50.190 --> 20:51.320
Not willingly.

20:52.020 --> 20:54.120
I can order you to hand that box over,

20:54.320 --> 20:56.280
arrest you for withholding evidence.

20:56.930 --> 20:58.540
Then you would have no idea

20:58.660 --> 21:00.260
what anything in there means.

21:01.300 --> 21:02.580
What it relates to,

21:03.340 --> 21:04.640
and what else I might have.

21:06.470 --> 21:08.230
This is a negotiation, right?

21:14.300 --> 21:16.130
We need to go through all this,

21:16.530 --> 21:18.720
log it, formally admit it,

21:19.280 --> 21:21.510
prepare a preliminary witness statement.

21:22.010 --> 21:22.750
OK.

21:24.410 --> 21:27.120
I will also have to formally caution you.

21:28.000 --> 21:28.880
Why?

21:29.180 --> 21:30.670
Standard procedure.

21:30.860 --> 21:32.310
You're presenting criminal evidence

21:32.310 --> 21:35.860
and stating you were present at
the scene, on several occasions.

21:36.580 --> 21:38.540
In truth, in your shoes,

21:39.090 --> 21:41.270
I wouldn't have come in
here without a lawyer.

21:41.990 --> 21:43.630
I didn't know who to trust.

21:45.670 --> 21:47.880
My father told me to trust no one.

21:48.390 --> 21:49.860
It was good advice.

21:51.700 --> 21:52.780
We can stop,

21:53.630 --> 21:56.120
give you time to secure representation.

21:58.520 --> 22:00.260
I need this to happen now.

22:02.090 --> 22:03.690
How long has this been going on?

22:04.310 --> 22:05.310
Weeks.

22:07.380 --> 22:08.440
Months.

22:10.530 --> 22:12.510
Since have been strained
since Martin came, but

22:12.520 --> 22:14.380
the... the second mortgage, the loans,

22:14.820 --> 22:16.350
they go back way before then.

22:17.620 --> 22:18.860
And who else knows?

22:19.110 --> 22:21.190
Maureen knows some, and

22:21.360 --> 22:22.390
maybe everything.

22:23.520 --> 22:24.810
She's right about one thing.

22:26.650 --> 22:27.950
You can't speak to Jean.

22:28.150 --> 22:29.880
No, I have to talk to him about it.

22:29.950 --> 22:31.260
Come on, he's my husband.

22:31.460 --> 22:34.360
Who has been lying to
you on several counts.

22:34.680 --> 22:36.450
Money, criminal activity,

22:36.880 --> 22:38.020
God knows what else.

22:44.310 --> 22:45.600
As of right now,

22:46.220 --> 22:47.520
I'm your lawyer.

22:47.740 --> 22:51.520
And anything you say to me is
protected by attorney-client privilege.

22:51.540 --> 22:53.010
Is that really necessary?

22:53.360 --> 22:54.320
Completely.

22:54.920 --> 22:56.930
And I'm not giving you a fucking choice.

22:57.340 --> 22:59.120
You need to protect yourself,

22:59.340 --> 23:00.440
and the children,

23:00.880 --> 23:03.030
in case he starts moving money around.

23:03.650 --> 23:06.320
Trust me, I have seen it all before.

23:06.360 --> 23:09.390
And you do not want to come
out of this with nothing.

23:10.750 --> 23:12.130
So, what do you know?

23:14.780 --> 23:16.270
It was the first time.

23:16.720 --> 23:19.980
We arrived, and DCI Kendrick
was already dead.

23:20.170 --> 23:21.520
Shot in the head.

23:27.520 --> 23:29.210
We had no option.

23:29.680 --> 23:31.450
The threat was implicit.

23:31.820 --> 23:35.450
Get rid of Frank McElroy's body
or there would be consequences.

23:36.480 --> 23:37.780
It wasn't murder,

23:38.380 --> 23:39.960
the overdose killed her.

23:40.400 --> 23:42.700
But I was tasked with moving the body

23:42.820 --> 23:45.130
making it look accidental,

23:45.250 --> 23:47.020
to protect a politician.

23:48.380 --> 23:51.300
When I returned home,
Nelson was sitting on my front step.

23:51.510 --> 23:53.680
He told me quite openly

23:53.930 --> 23:57.320
that he ordered the killing
of Veysel Kisa and his wife.

24:02.210 --> 24:05.390
Interview suspended at 15:23.

24:06.340 --> 24:07.420
Let's take a break.

24:07.580 --> 24:09.650
Go get yourself some coffee or something.

24:10.180 --> 24:11.900
Don't you need to arrest him?

24:12.300 --> 24:14.500
We're just at the
beginning of a long process.

24:14.560 --> 24:16.410
This guy knows where I am

24:16.620 --> 24:17.550
round the clock.

24:17.960 --> 24:19.770
And we know where he is.

24:19.770 --> 24:21.330
It's what we do.

24:22.370 --> 24:25.740
Your life and the lives of
your family is about to change.

24:26.100 --> 24:27.210
Go get some air.

24:30.980 --> 24:31.540
OK.

24:54.940 --> 24:56.730
I'll just be one moment, OK?

25:05.370 --> 25:06.150
Come on.

25:07.260 --> 25:09.480
- What are you doing?
- Well you wouldn't take my calls.

25:09.700 --> 25:11.940
You stood me up.
Left me sitting alone in a restaurant.

25:11.960 --> 25:13.500
Please, I don't have much time.

25:16.040 --> 25:17.500
I had to go to the cops.

25:17.510 --> 25:18.980
There's no choice.

25:19.630 --> 25:20.990
You must be relieved.

25:21.010 --> 25:22.170
Not really.

25:22.550 --> 25:23.500
New life,

25:23.520 --> 25:25.050
new place, new beginning.

25:25.850 --> 25:26.680
I just...

25:27.180 --> 25:28.970
I just wanted to say goodbye.

25:29.040 --> 25:30.530
For your sake or mine?

25:32.560 --> 25:35.440
- And in other circumstances...
- Don't fucking patronize me!

25:36.730 --> 25:39.450
I'm done with this kind of
thing. It leaves a bad taste.

25:41.150 --> 25:42.190
I'm sorry.

25:44.100 --> 25:45.050
Don't be.

25:46.420 --> 25:48.560
I'm a big girl, I knew
what I was getting into.

25:50.110 --> 25:51.340
How's your mom?

25:54.290 --> 25:55.340
She's dying.

26:01.100 --> 26:02.120
Goodbye, Jean.

26:11.480 --> 26:12.340
Good luck.

26:47.200 --> 26:48.660
- Hello.
- Hi.

26:48.780 --> 26:50.410
I'm looking for your husband.

26:50.730 --> 26:51.740
He's not here.

26:52.920 --> 26:54.190
Do you know where I can find him?

26:54.560 --> 26:56.570
No, he doesn't stick to routine.

26:59.230 --> 27:00.830
What happened to your face?

27:02.020 --> 27:03.660
My past caught up with me.

27:05.660 --> 27:06.700
The kettle's on.

27:08.030 --> 27:09.080
Will you come in?

27:09.360 --> 27:10.070
Please.

27:13.030 --> 27:13.860
Thanks.

27:19.370 --> 27:21.090
Your husband needs to back off,

27:21.930 --> 27:24.690
leave my brother and his family alone.
He's done nothing wrong.

27:26.010 --> 27:27.310
Nelson likes Jean.

27:27.710 --> 27:28.570
Not anymore.

27:29.770 --> 27:30.680
Sit down.

27:38.890 --> 27:40.930
- You could have internal bleeding.
- I'm fine.

27:45.010 --> 27:46.080
Have you been to a hospital?

27:51.240 --> 27:52.590
What painkillers are you on?

27:53.210 --> 27:54.110
Aspirin.

27:54.780 --> 27:56.350
I'm not big on medication.

27:56.810 --> 27:58.250
I used to be a nurse.

27:58.960 --> 28:01.620
Um, I'm pretty sure we
can do better than aspirin.

28:24.720 --> 28:26.140
What the fuck?

28:26.890 --> 28:28.420
Try to keep the noise down.

28:30.120 --> 28:31.610
He can just walk in here?

28:35.080 --> 28:36.770
Well, I have never been arrested,

28:37.880 --> 28:39.510
or even questioned,

28:40.580 --> 28:43.400
over any crimes since I was in my teens.

28:44.930 --> 28:46.090
I'm invisible.

28:48.230 --> 28:49.120
Sit down.

28:51.680 --> 28:52.680
Sit down.

28:59.130 --> 29:01.510
Good and bad are relative concepts.

29:02.340 --> 29:03.730
Told you that before.

29:04.640 --> 29:06.000
Is everyone corrupt?

29:06.860 --> 29:08.780
Corrupt doesn't come into it.

29:10.780 --> 29:11.730
Is this it?

29:17.800 --> 29:19.040
Ah.

29:25.080 --> 29:26.760
Relatively small...

29:28.800 --> 29:31.560
considering the potential
harm it could have done.

29:37.830 --> 29:39.650
This disappears, all right?

29:42.410 --> 29:43.620
We done?

29:50.370 --> 29:51.760
He came in to barter.

29:52.400 --> 29:53.920
I think he has something else.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.370
Do you have something else?

30:05.720 --> 30:06.320
No.

30:06.530 --> 30:07.470
He's lying.

30:08.630 --> 30:11.400
You said it yourself,
this is a negotiation.

30:11.840 --> 30:13.840
What else do you have?

30:17.950 --> 30:19.420
You're right.

30:20.790 --> 30:22.360
He's lying.

30:26.110 --> 30:28.940
Why did you visit Tom Kendrick's widow?

30:29.400 --> 30:30.820
You were observed.

30:34.340 --> 30:35.960
To see how she

30:36.340 --> 30:38.040
was holding up.

30:46.760 --> 30:47.920
Excuse me.

30:49.150 --> 30:51.710
Let's see what Mrs Kendrick has to say.

30:56.860 --> 30:58.290
You're a cancer.

31:03.280 --> 31:04.840
Diane Squire

31:05.180 --> 31:07.440
takes a modest stipend.

31:07.630 --> 31:08.970
She's a single mother,

31:09.090 --> 31:10.940
she has a teenage son.

31:11.330 --> 31:12.950
But she's not greedy.

31:14.100 --> 31:16.460
She doesn't like to fill her boots

31:16.480 --> 31:18.540
like Tom Kendrick did.

31:20.220 --> 31:22.180
Did I underestimate you or

31:22.190 --> 31:24.950
- overestimate you? I don't know...
- Do you know how tired I am,

31:24.950 --> 31:26.480
of listening to you?

31:27.630 --> 31:29.770
With your "man-of-the-people" shit.

31:31.010 --> 31:32.950
You're not a philosopher.

31:33.690 --> 31:35.350
You're just a thug

31:35.720 --> 31:37.340
that read a book once.

31:38.080 --> 31:39.530
Nothing more.

31:42.840 --> 31:45.100
This should clarify things.

31:50.610 --> 31:52.620
- Hello?
- Mrs Kendrick?

31:52.880 --> 31:54.300
Yes, speaking.

31:54.740 --> 31:58.250
So sorry to disturb you.
This is DCI Diane Squire

31:58.270 --> 32:00.090
Fortune Road police station.

32:00.560 --> 32:03.250
I wondered, could I have
two minutes of your time?

32:03.700 --> 32:04.980
Of course.

32:05.470 --> 32:07.400
It's come to our
attention that some of your

32:07.400 --> 32:09.810
husband's computer files were stolen.

32:09.820 --> 32:10.970
We recovered them

32:11.040 --> 32:13.670
in the possession of a
man named Jean Bastière.

32:14.720 --> 32:15.980
The Frenchman?

32:16.270 --> 32:17.870
Yeah, he came to see me.

32:18.120 --> 32:19.310
Recently?

32:19.880 --> 32:21.820
He didn't threaten you, did he?

32:22.240 --> 32:23.780
No, nothing like that.

32:23.990 --> 32:25.370
He was rather lovely.

32:27.200 --> 32:30.190
Can I ask, do you recall why he was there?

32:30.450 --> 32:33.020
Was he looking for something in particular?

32:33.450 --> 32:36.540
No, just some general questions about Tom.

32:36.600 --> 32:39.980
Oh, we had a little chat about Fallowfield.

32:41.580 --> 32:42.730
Fallowfield?

32:43.020 --> 32:43.960
What is that?

32:43.980 --> 32:45.150
It's just a property.

32:45.160 --> 32:48.050
A place in the country me and Tom had. Why?

32:50.420 --> 32:51.620
These are good.

32:52.110 --> 32:52.970
Thanks.

32:57.440 --> 32:59.690
I'm sure you've seen a
lot of faces like this.

33:01.540 --> 33:03.340
I never worked in the A&E.

33:04.610 --> 33:06.170
I mean a woman like you.

33:08.580 --> 33:10.190
What is a woman like me?

33:12.360 --> 33:13.670
How many kids

33:14.400 --> 33:17.760
did Nelson get hooked on
heroin to pay for your house?

33:18.700 --> 33:20.950
I think you're confused as to what he does.

33:21.380 --> 33:22.620
I'm not judging.

33:23.990 --> 33:26.960
I'm just curious to see how
you rationalize everything.

33:28.150 --> 33:30.360
We're all different
things to different people.

33:31.480 --> 33:32.990
So you detach.

33:34.820 --> 33:36.620
To me my husband is kind,

33:36.950 --> 33:38.200
supportive.

33:39.950 --> 33:42.800
- To you he's...
- He's a psychopath.

33:46.280 --> 33:47.730
Actually I came here

33:47.790 --> 33:49.350
to invite your husband to kill me

33:50.000 --> 33:51.340
in place of my brother.

33:54.390 --> 33:56.070
But you're not gonna die today.

33:58.730 --> 33:59.830
Listen, you...

34:00.120 --> 34:02.640
you can't have any more
painkillers, but, uh...

34:05.130 --> 34:06.200
One minute.

34:09.210 --> 34:10.310
Over here...

34:13.679 --> 34:15.570
is medical-grade marijuana.

34:16.310 --> 34:19.159
Your husband runs crack dens

34:19.750 --> 34:22.070
and you have to hide a tin of weed?

34:22.070 --> 34:24.340
I used to get it for my cancer patients.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.370
Be stupid not to keep
the dealer on speed dial.

34:46.469 --> 34:48.570
How come you lot didn't know about this?

34:49.210 --> 34:50.840
I thought he was under investigation.

34:50.889 --> 34:53.040
This place was under
his wife's maiden name.

34:53.060 --> 34:54.570
Kept it under the radar.

34:56.250 --> 34:58.510
So, this is what my money paid for.

35:10.470 --> 35:12.160
So where do we start?

35:13.520 --> 35:15.010
What are we looking for?

35:15.470 --> 35:18.520
It's you who think there's
something to look for, not me.

35:20.080 --> 35:23.200
You two start at the top of
the house. I'll start here

35:23.230 --> 35:26.340
Begin at the centre of the room,
and work your way to the edges.

35:28.190 --> 35:29.670
You're the expert, are you?

35:29.890 --> 35:31.430
Yes, I am.

35:31.950 --> 35:32.770
What are you?

35:32.790 --> 35:34.600
Other than a half-wit with a cannon?

35:37.470 --> 35:40.200
Hide behind your badge, love.

35:40.600 --> 35:42.900
- That's all you'll ever do.
- Yeah, all right.

35:43.660 --> 35:45.610
You can pull her pigtails later.

35:46.120 --> 35:47.190
Upstairs.

35:55.150 --> 35:58.750
I always feel sorry for those who
follow in the footsteps of the dead.

36:00.360 --> 36:01.950
In order to find love,

36:04.020 --> 36:05.930
someone else had to suffer.

36:08.770 --> 36:11.000
Plenty of people marry widowers.

36:11.930 --> 36:13.160
Sure,

36:13.570 --> 36:14.910
but it's tainted.

36:14.950 --> 36:16.220
They're bereaved.

36:17.190 --> 36:18.840
At best, you're second choice.

36:18.850 --> 36:23.000
And at worst, it's you, him, and a ghost.

36:23.760 --> 36:25.540
I don't think of it like that.

36:28.620 --> 36:30.960
I wonder what it would feel like to find a

36:30.990 --> 36:33.270
completely clean new love.

36:36.240 --> 36:37.490
And I wouldn't be saying that

36:37.510 --> 36:40.170
if I had not been smoking this.

36:45.420 --> 36:47.210
He's gonna be home soon.

36:51.200 --> 36:52.530
Then I should leave.

36:53.960 --> 36:54.950
You should.

36:58.140 --> 37:00.860
You're not what I expected
to find coming here, you know?

37:06.100 --> 37:08.380
I could, stay in town tonight.

37:10.720 --> 37:12.180
I sometimes do.

37:18.560 --> 37:20.910
Whatever it is, we'll find it.

37:23.350 --> 37:26.630
Why does Nelson keep you
so close all this time?

37:26.910 --> 37:29.400
Despite the difficulty you cause him.

37:30.650 --> 37:33.130
Because you're so good at what you do.

37:34.370 --> 37:35.760
There will come a point,

37:35.800 --> 37:37.300
possibly in the next hour,

37:37.480 --> 37:40.430
where the negatives of that
arrangement outweigh the positives.

37:42.890 --> 37:44.840
You could have a good life.

37:45.610 --> 37:46.870
Like you?

37:55.120 --> 37:57.020
My father was an alcoholic.

37:57.420 --> 37:59.660
The same one that told
you not to trust anyone?

37:59.950 --> 38:01.760
He was a weak man.

38:02.820 --> 38:04.440
I realized at a young age

38:04.440 --> 38:08.130
how much effort is wasted
denying the inevitable.

38:12.450 --> 38:13.750
I've had enough of this.

38:16.420 --> 38:17.590
Get up!

38:32.730 --> 38:34.190
What am I looking for?

38:53.220 --> 38:55.040
If we dump your body here,

38:55.050 --> 38:56.870
you'll never be found.

38:57.740 --> 38:59.240
Do you understand that?

39:15.610 --> 39:16.920
Talk to me.

39:17.640 --> 39:20.300
That's all you have to do and it finishes.

39:21.720 --> 39:23.440
I don't have to see this.

39:25.430 --> 39:26.450
Again.

40:44.450 --> 40:46.920
_

40:51.850 --> 40:52.930
Again.

40:56.130 --> 40:57.240
Enough!

40:59.780 --> 41:01.750
I think Kendrick went
to extraordinary lengths

41:01.770 --> 41:03.760
to make things watertight, don't you?

42:23.400 --> 42:24.900
<i>Jesus, Victor.</i>

42:27.720 --> 42:29.100
Fuck.

42:29.220 --> 42:30.930
That's quite a selfie!

42:34.360 --> 42:35.590
I had no idea.

42:36.560 --> 42:39.120
How the hell did Tom
Kendrick pull this off?

42:39.660 --> 42:41.250
Didn't think he had it in him.

42:41.690 --> 42:43.810
Motion sensitive camcorder.

42:43.860 --> 42:46.600
Basic home security. A couple
hundred on the high street.

42:46.640 --> 42:48.650
It's hardly rocket science.

42:49.010 --> 42:52.430
Make sure every component
is completely destroyed.

42:55.340 --> 42:57.490
And how can we be sure
that this is everything?

43:00.480 --> 43:02.140
He's got nothing else.

43:05.800 --> 43:07.240
Just in case.

43:18.530 --> 43:21.210
- You can't do that in front of me!
- Why the fuck not?

43:21.210 --> 43:23.600
Because there have to be
some fucking boundaries.

43:23.600 --> 43:25.230
I'm a senior officer.

43:26.270 --> 43:28.000
He'll be on camera, at the nick.

43:28.010 --> 43:30.730
More than once, throughout the day.

43:37.370 --> 43:40.850
You should buy a lottery ticket, mate.
You're the luckiest man I know.

43:57.060 --> 43:58.120
Hey.

43:58.470 --> 44:00.120
You bought some new stuff?

44:07.170 --> 44:08.250
Maddy?

44:24.420 --> 44:26.350
- Maddy...
- Leave me alone!

44:27.990 --> 44:28.970
I'm sorry.

44:28.980 --> 44:31.120
- Uh, please don't be embarrassed.
- Just go away!

44:31.240 --> 44:32.730
Do you want to talk about it?

44:37.940 --> 44:39.780
You enjoy your party, all right?

44:41.180 --> 44:42.900
There is no party.

45:30.480 --> 45:32.450
Hey. I'm in town.

45:34.510 --> 45:35.740
Where are you?

47:44.660 --> 47:46.290
This can't happen again.

47:47.170 --> 47:48.690
I don't do this.

47:49.640 --> 47:50.880
Of course not.

47:58.220 --> 48:00.510
Give it ten minutes, and then, um...

48:01.650 --> 48:04.520
just pull the door shut–it will lock,
when you're on your way out.

48:06.400 --> 48:08.950
This is Nelson's place.
We can't be seen together.

48:11.640 --> 48:12.630
OK.

49:11.900 --> 49:13.650
Uh, are you cooking?

49:14.020 --> 49:16.860
Nina's coming.
She took Oliver to the cinema.

49:16.890 --> 49:18.270
She's gonna have some supper.

49:20.450 --> 49:22.150
So, gossip and a catch-up.

49:22.700 --> 49:23.980
Girls' night in?

49:24.370 --> 49:25.200
Exactly.

49:27.270 --> 49:29.300
Then I'll make myself scarce.

49:30.050 --> 49:30.960
OK.

52:08.030 --> 52:10.200
Fuck! Charlie?

52:11.250 --> 52:12.830
I nearly shit myself.

52:12.830 --> 52:14.820
Yeah, well that would
undo all your good work.

52:14.880 --> 52:17.030
- What are you doing here?
- I'm just locking up.

52:17.090 --> 52:18.720
Making sure it's secure.

52:19.530 --> 52:21.400
Terrible thing that happened here.

52:21.520 --> 52:23.500
What kind of world, eh?

52:24.320 --> 52:26.290
Proper gangland killing.

52:26.640 --> 52:28.970
Post-mortem says very skilfully done.

52:29.640 --> 52:31.210
So why the mess?

52:32.550 --> 52:34.170
After they were dead,

52:34.670 --> 52:36.950
they only went and fucked
the corpse of the wife.

52:37.890 --> 52:40.460
- What?
- Necrophilia.

52:41.240 --> 52:43.530
Now, what kind of a person
does a thing like that?
