00:44.794 --> 00:48.131
TOMORROW, WITH YOU

00:53.011 --> 00:59.184
You're here to witness a human
beat what is to come in the future.

00:59.267 --> 01:02.896
Im Yo-hwan has mounted an attack.

01:02.979 --> 01:06.608
That's right! He's done a multi-check,
now he must attack.

01:06.691 --> 01:07.650
Yes, it's going up.

01:07.734 --> 01:11.613
Now, Alpha Craft
must make a critical decision.

01:11.696 --> 01:15.158
-That's correct.
-Alpha Craft must make a decision.

01:15.241 --> 01:18.495
Alpha Craft won the first two matches.

01:18.578 --> 01:23.917
Im Yo-hwan won the next two,
now he is close to winning.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.419
This will determine the winner.

01:26.503 --> 01:27.879
He has to choose.

01:27.962 --> 01:30.548
That's right. It's winding down.

01:30.965 --> 01:33.510
We really didn't know who would win.

01:33.593 --> 01:38.848
Im Yo-hwan's timing
for attack was precise!

01:38.932 --> 01:42.102
Even the supercomputer
couldn't time this right.

01:42.185 --> 01:47.232
Alpha Craft's artificial intelligence
must be mentally stressed.

01:47.315 --> 01:49.025
He won!

01:49.567 --> 01:52.904
He won!

01:52.987 --> 01:55.406
IM YO-HWAN BEATS
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ALPHA CRAFT

01:57.575 --> 02:04.541
<i>Humans win a victory over the future.</i>

02:06.209 --> 02:08.086
Of course. Yo-hwan.

02:08.169 --> 02:10.797
You're really something. You're the best!

02:14.968 --> 02:18.304
Even with the development of AI,
Yo-hwan can't be beat.

02:18.680 --> 02:19.597
Of course not.

02:20.390 --> 02:24.185
What should I wear today?

02:24.269 --> 02:25.728
Let's get going.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.815
It's Christmas.

02:32.861 --> 02:33.987
They are so cute.

02:34.404 --> 02:36.114
Why are they so cute?

02:38.700 --> 02:42.579
Yo-hwan, I am so proud of you.
You're the best in our country.

02:43.872 --> 02:46.291
The year 2018 is coming to an end.

02:48.668 --> 02:50.837
What should I buy for Se-young's birthday?

02:51.671 --> 02:54.007
What would be good?

02:59.804 --> 03:02.765
ADIEU 2018

03:14.819 --> 03:20.575
<i>The subway is coming in now.</i>

04:16.297 --> 04:19.759
<i>This stop is Namyeong.</i>

04:20.051 --> 04:22.095
<i>The door is on your right.</i>

04:22.470 --> 04:23.888
<i>I am a time traveler.</i>

04:24.889 --> 04:27.267
<i>I travel to the future on the subway.</i>

04:43.449 --> 04:45.201
<i>but I decline all questions.</i>

04:46.286 --> 04:49.163
<i>I have no interest in the lives of others.</i>

04:52.375 --> 04:56.004
LOVELY MOMENT

05:05.013 --> 05:07.056
Gosh, they don't look friendly at all.

05:12.103 --> 05:14.105
Friends! Smile.

05:14.689 --> 05:15.815
-Yes.
-Okay.

05:15.898 --> 05:17.650
-Smile.
-Yes.

05:21.612 --> 05:23.865
The bridesmaids must not be close
with the bride.

05:25.491 --> 05:27.618
Oh, no. We're very close.

05:28.411 --> 05:30.830
Do you know how famous
that photographer is?

05:30.913 --> 05:32.498
You should know this is an honor.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.586
Hey, you on the right.

05:36.794 --> 05:40.590
You with the hip angled at 45 degrees.
The one with the foot pointed. Yes, you.

05:41.382 --> 05:43.885
Just stand straight.
Yes, stand straight like that.

05:43.968 --> 05:46.554
Join together. Be one of them.

05:46.637 --> 05:48.723
What should I do with my arms?

05:49.432 --> 05:50.975
You're doing very well already.

05:51.059 --> 05:54.103
I was very surprised.
I thought you might have done this before.

05:54.187 --> 05:55.688
This is your first marriage?

05:55.772 --> 05:57.690
Let's start now.

05:58.941 --> 05:59.984
On three.

06:00.068 --> 06:02.070
If the pictures turn out well,
no gifts.

06:02.153 --> 06:03.738
One, two... three.

06:04.447 --> 06:05.365
Good.

06:08.493 --> 06:09.369
Yes, Ki-doong.

06:09.452 --> 06:11.662
<i>You'd leave without telling me?</i>
<i>Where are you?</i>

06:12.413 --> 06:14.248
Do you know what I just saw?

06:14.540 --> 06:17.460
Im Yo-hwan and Alpha Craft
had a match in 2018.

06:17.543 --> 06:19.337
<i>Hey, don't tell me the result.</i>

06:20.046 --> 06:22.090
You know today
is Se-young's birthday, right?

06:22.340 --> 06:25.301
I even bought a birthday present
from far away.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.970
Just tell us when you're here.
No need to act so cool.

06:28.054 --> 06:29.972
He bluffs more every time he goes.

06:30.056 --> 06:32.058
-You're in a good mood.
-Yes, Im Yo-hwan won.

06:32.141 --> 06:33.351
Im Yo-hwan?

06:34.018 --> 06:35.144
Happy birthday.

06:35.937 --> 06:38.648
I have an important thing to do today,
so you two celebrate.

06:38.731 --> 06:41.067
-What?
-What don't I know about?

06:41.359 --> 06:43.569
Don't think you know everything about me.

06:44.695 --> 06:45.655
Se-young.

06:45.947 --> 06:47.615
That is a brand new product.

06:47.698 --> 06:49.492
Maybe too new.

06:49.575 --> 06:52.662
It's so new
that we don't even have a concept yet.

06:53.037 --> 06:55.790
-Bye-bye.
-Is this a present or what?

06:55.873 --> 06:57.458
-It's a good one.
-I'll take it.

06:57.542 --> 06:59.210
-The best. Bye.
-What are you up to?

06:59.293 --> 07:00.670
A matter of life or death.

SONG MA-RIN CAR ACCIDENT
4:14 PM

07:15.226 --> 07:17.311
-This is not right.
-I know.

07:17.395 --> 07:21.232
How could Gun-sook ask
us to be her bridesmaids?

07:21.566 --> 07:24.277
Does she not know
that we don't like her?

07:24.986 --> 07:28.322
We haven't liked her for 15 years.
How could she not know?

07:29.115 --> 07:29.949
That's true.

07:30.408 --> 07:32.952
She's been pretending
not to know for 15 years.

07:33.035 --> 07:34.120
Really.

07:34.203 --> 07:37.498
She's getting married though.
Let's send her off well.

07:37.915 --> 07:40.376
-Yeah.
-Even Ma-rin is holding it in.

07:40.626 --> 07:43.421
Why is Ma-rin being so cooperative?

07:43.504 --> 07:45.882
Though you came,
I didn't think Ma-rin would come.

07:45.965 --> 07:47.675
Shouldn't she feel bitter?

07:47.758 --> 07:49.719
Song Ma-rin is not like her.

07:50.052 --> 07:52.847
Maybe she received
something from Gun-sook secretly?

07:57.435 --> 07:58.603
Hello!

08:00.313 --> 08:01.856
Please, take this.

08:05.359 --> 08:07.945
I'm a fan of yours.

08:09.322 --> 08:10.156
You are?

08:10.239 --> 08:12.408
It's an honor to meet you.

08:16.120 --> 08:18.206
Gun-sook's husband... I mean...

08:19.332 --> 08:22.376
you must be a good friend of the groom.

08:22.543 --> 08:25.213
Seeing as how you're taking
personal photos and all.

08:26.047 --> 08:29.175
You must be a photographer.
That looks like a portfolio.

08:29.842 --> 08:31.761
You want to give that to me,
don't you?

08:33.137 --> 08:35.056
Do you need an assistant,
by any chance?

08:36.641 --> 08:40.728
Aren't you Bap-soon, the child actress?

08:43.773 --> 08:44.982
I guess I'm right.

08:45.566 --> 08:48.110
This is unusual.
You're more famous than I am.

08:49.403 --> 08:51.072
I guess it didn't work out for you.

08:53.699 --> 08:56.244
You really have a sharp eye.

08:58.037 --> 08:59.705
No one ever recognizes me.

09:00.206 --> 09:03.292
Bap-soon was ages ago.
I was six then.

09:05.211 --> 09:06.587
Bap-soon!

09:07.421 --> 09:09.924
You are so lucky, thanks to me.

09:10.216 --> 09:14.011
If not for my Yong-jin,
when else could you see her work?

09:17.265 --> 09:19.809
Anyway, I'm not accepting apprentices.

09:25.690 --> 09:27.066
You're crazy.

09:27.400 --> 09:30.861
Did you latch onto her to take you in?
I better apologize on your behalf.

09:30.945 --> 09:32.238
Oh, my. Don't.

09:32.321 --> 09:33.197
Wait.

09:34.907 --> 09:38.869
Do you also have a friend
who makes you mad when you're together?

09:40.705 --> 09:44.375
You're worried about her
finding out your secrets.

09:45.209 --> 09:46.294
When you are apart,

09:46.377 --> 09:50.506
you hear from others
that she's going around insulting you.

09:51.632 --> 09:53.801
Gun-sook and I are that kind of friends.

09:53.884 --> 09:56.804
We're not the type
to be each other's bridesmaids.

09:57.555 --> 09:59.640
But, I came here to meet you.

10:00.975 --> 10:03.102
You saw how brightly
I was smiling, right?

10:04.604 --> 10:05.563
Bap-soon.

10:06.147 --> 10:07.231
My name is Song Ma-rin.

10:07.940 --> 10:10.860
You have no shame.

10:13.779 --> 10:17.783
I may not have majored in photography,
but I've been studying it for seven years.

10:18.159 --> 10:20.328
I'm not just asking you to do me a favor.

10:20.911 --> 10:23.331
Whenever you have time,
can you look at my portfolio?

10:23.414 --> 10:27.877
Even while you're in the bathroom,
can you look at it just once?

10:32.298 --> 10:34.383
It's an annoying day.

10:35.593 --> 10:36.636
It's heavy, too.

10:37.136 --> 10:38.012
Thank you.

10:39.305 --> 10:40.598
Thank you.

Smile, okay.

10:53.569 --> 10:55.655
-Isn't she Song Ma-rin?

11:05.206 --> 11:09.502
<i>Because she might hold my life</i>

11:10.544 --> 11:12.421
It's not the same.

11:12.546 --> 11:13.881
You'll need to differentiate.

11:14.632 --> 11:16.258
I'll go first.

11:16.967 --> 11:17.885
Let's go eat.

11:17.968 --> 11:19.011
No, thanks.

11:19.095 --> 11:20.554
<i>She declines to eat with them.</i>

11:21.681 --> 11:24.809
<i>Then she will go into a convenience store</i>
<i>and eat cup ramen.</i>

11:25.768 --> 11:27.728
I'll just have cup ramen.

11:38.656 --> 11:40.574
Why do I keep seeing that guy around?

11:40.908 --> 11:42.326
So weird.

11:58.884 --> 11:59.719
Excuse me.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.722

Uh, well...

Who are you?

12:10.521 --> 12:12.773
-Can we talk for a moment?
-I don't want to.

12:13.357 --> 12:14.442
Just one coffee.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.527
-What's with him?
<i>-</i>Wait.

12:16.610 --> 12:17.528
Goodness.

12:18.320 --> 12:19.196
Do you know me?

12:19.280 --> 12:20.489
I don't know you.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.783
You don't have to be so frightened of me.

12:22.867 --> 12:24.160
You're a bit strange.

12:24.910 --> 12:28.205
-So scary.
<i>-</i>I just need five minutes. Wait.

12:29.999 --> 12:33.252
You're so beautiful.
I just want to have coffee with you.

12:42.720 --> 12:44.096
How do you know my name?

12:45.765 --> 12:47.475
You called me Song Ma-rin.

12:49.310 --> 12:51.145
You're very famous.

12:52.146 --> 12:53.564
-Bap-soon...
-Forget it.

12:55.524 --> 12:57.485
Your overwhelming interest
is uncomfortable.

12:57.693 --> 12:59.403
It's not like I'm a celebrity.

12:59.737 --> 13:03.532
Also, I'm saying this
because it bothered me a little.

13:05.201 --> 13:08.996
Nevermind. I haven't seen you before.
I think I'm overreacting.

13:09.079 --> 13:11.207
No, please tell me. It's okay.

13:11.874 --> 13:14.627
Talk to me. Don't walk this way.

13:14.919 --> 13:16.837
I'm just so curious.

13:18.506 --> 13:19.423
Well...

13:20.466 --> 13:22.885
If you were curious and wanted to talk,

13:22.968 --> 13:25.721
all you had to do was say so.

13:26.388 --> 13:29.016
You grabbed my wrist twice,
and touched me.

13:30.059 --> 13:32.686
You pretended to fall for me,
saying I was beautiful.

13:33.395 --> 13:36.106
I feel harassed,
and it's not a nice feeling.

13:36.440 --> 13:40.277
You must have many men who follow you,
saying you are beautiful.

13:42.321 --> 13:46.492
You're tired of it. You're so tired of it,
it makes you cranky, right?

13:47.743 --> 13:50.704
I'm right.
I can see that happening.

13:51.872 --> 13:53.123
I totally understand that.

13:54.208 --> 13:57.878
Well, we've come to an understanding now.
How about a coffee?

13:57.962 --> 13:59.046
No, thank you.

14:00.089 --> 14:01.215
We resolved things...

14:13.394 --> 14:15.855
That was a very close call.

14:17.815 --> 14:18.816
Excuse me.

14:18.899 --> 14:19.733
Yes?

14:21.902 --> 14:23.362
You shouldn't do this.

14:28.534 --> 14:30.661
How should I put it?

14:32.037 --> 14:33.163
You lack skills.

I really didn't hit her.

-I know. I saw it.
-She was just walking like a model

15:00.024 --> 15:00.858
and fainted.

15:01.317 --> 15:03.360
She must have been scared or something.

15:03.444 --> 15:05.946
-Is that why she fainted?
-Song Ma-rin!

15:06.655 --> 15:08.782

15:26.759 --> 15:28.093
<i>What is this? A comedy?</i>

15:29.845 --> 15:32.181
<i>"Give me rice."</i>
<i>The entire nation cried</i>

15:32.389 --> 15:34.850
<i>and laughed over the line.</i>

15:42.399 --> 15:44.652
BAP-SOON, SONG MA-RIN'S SHOCKING LIFE

15:45.152 --> 15:46.153
What is with her?

15:47.655 --> 15:49.323
She must be a crazy drinker.

16:00.125 --> 16:01.126
What's happening?

16:01.251 --> 16:02.336
SHARING: WRITE REPLY

16:02.419 --> 16:04.713
-BAP-SOON PASSED OUT IN ITAEWON.
-LIFE IS HARD.

16:06.674 --> 16:08.092
She moved!

16:09.385 --> 16:12.930
How much did she drink?
Why is she doing this?

16:14.431 --> 16:16.350
-SHE IS DANCING DIRTY.
-AGAIN?

16:16.433 --> 16:19.353
-SHE DID THAT LAST WEEK.
-SHE CANNOT LOVE WITHOUT ATTENTION.

16:19.436 --> 16:21.355
DOES SHE HAVE MANY FANS?

16:21.438 --> 16:24.191
-SHE IS PERSISTENT.
-I HATE HER.

16:24.650 --> 16:27.403
You know, I just want to live freely.

16:28.779 --> 16:30.030
You know how I feel, right?

16:31.824 --> 16:34.159
Yes, only you understand.

16:34.618 --> 16:37.037
-SHE IS IMPOSSIBLE.
-MAYBE SHE DOESN'T WANT TO LIVE.

16:37.162 --> 16:40.332
-MORE DRINKS!
-NO, BAP-SOON, LOL.

16:40.416 --> 16:41.875
Thank you, friend.

16:41.959 --> 16:44.169
-DOESN'T SHE FEEL SHAME?
-LOL.

16:45.379 --> 16:48.632
Having gone through this,
she is still not living a quiet life.

16:48.841 --> 16:49.800
She likes...

16:51.051 --> 16:52.428
alcohol so much.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.559
Why does she live like this?

17:04.023 --> 17:06.275
How should I put it?

17:07.818 --> 17:09.820
You lack skills.

17:13.073 --> 17:14.700
Strangely, that's insulting.

17:18.454 --> 17:19.413
Who's there?

17:20.998 --> 17:23.625
It's me, the unskilled guy from before.

17:27.087 --> 17:28.255
Where am I?

17:30.799 --> 17:33.552
-I got into a car accident.
-It wasn't a car accident.

17:34.094 --> 17:36.055
You didn't get hit. You just fainted.

17:38.432 --> 17:39.808
You didn't get hurt at all.

17:40.309 --> 17:41.685
That's not right.

17:42.978 --> 17:44.688
I did get into a car accident.

17:45.022 --> 17:47.357
You never know,
so you should talk to the doctor.

17:47.483 --> 17:48.817
Get yourself examined.

17:49.276 --> 17:51.320
It would be good
to get your liver checked.

17:51.820 --> 17:53.030
Why would you care?

17:53.197 --> 17:56.742
If I'm helping you,
it's because I have my reasons.

17:58.494 --> 18:00.537
Just lie down.

18:01.288 --> 18:04.917
I don't think you're fully alert yet.

18:14.551 --> 18:18.055
I'm the type of person
who can't speak up like this.

18:18.138 --> 18:19.723
Then are you an unskilled woman?

18:20.224 --> 18:21.642
It's nothing really.

18:22.476 --> 18:24.186
-What?
-See you next time.

18:25.479 --> 18:28.524
If it is fate, we'll meet again.

18:34.905 --> 18:35.864
What's with him?

18:40.869 --> 18:43.956
My daughter was brought
into the emergency room.

18:44.039 --> 18:45.332
Her name is Song Ma-rin.

18:45.415 --> 18:47.126
You can ask about her there.

18:47.251 --> 18:48.210
Wait.

18:48.710 --> 18:51.380
My daughter is not just a regular person.

18:51.463 --> 18:54.842
-Yes, over there...
-She's famous, an actress.

18:54.925 --> 18:56.426
Excuse me.

18:56.510 --> 18:59.471
-Where is my Bap-soon?
-Pardon me?

18:59.555 --> 19:03.016
-She did the "give me rice."
-Mom.

19:03.183 --> 19:04.852
Oh! Bap-soon.

19:04.977 --> 19:06.436
-Hey, you!
-Oh, my.

19:06.520 --> 19:08.856
-Are you okay?
-Let's get out.

19:08.939 --> 19:11.150
-Go.
-What's the problem?

19:11.233 --> 19:14.403
Why would you ask for Bap-soon?
Don't do that. People will laugh.

19:14.486 --> 19:15.863
It's this way.

19:17.531 --> 19:19.032
Who would laugh?

19:19.116 --> 19:21.618
Who doesn't know Bap-soon in this country?

19:22.286 --> 19:25.289
Your muscles might be in shock right now.

19:25.455 --> 19:26.790
Let's go get massages.

19:26.915 --> 19:29.668
I know a person
who runs a large Thai massage place.

19:29.877 --> 19:32.212
Who?  The man you're dating now?

19:33.964 --> 19:34.798
Wow.

19:35.299 --> 19:37.384
That hiking club is so messy.

19:37.509 --> 19:39.761
How can you date
one man after another from there?

19:39.845 --> 19:41.096
Stop nagging.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.807
-Meet him while you're there.
-Why would I meet him?

19:43.891 --> 19:47.019
-You'll have a new one next month.
-I bragged about you a lot.

19:48.437 --> 19:49.479
Did you use my name?

19:50.939 --> 19:51.982
I can't believe this.

19:54.735 --> 19:56.153
What did you lie about now?

19:57.070 --> 20:00.365
That Bap-soon is studying abroad?
That I debuted as a photographer?

20:00.532 --> 20:03.035
Or that I'm marrying a rich man?

20:03.869 --> 20:06.413
I just don't want
people to look down on us.

20:06.955 --> 20:09.291
Then just tell people
that I'm not your daughter.

20:09.625 --> 20:10.918
That would be easiest.

20:11.043 --> 20:12.044
You awful girl.

20:12.211 --> 20:15.047
Just let it go.
Give your mom some dignity.

20:15.214 --> 20:17.466
Hey, Bap-soon. Bap-soon!

20:19.259 --> 20:22.471
I promised we would go.
What am I supposed to do?

20:23.430 --> 20:25.432
It would be nice to get a massage.

20:27.142 --> 20:28.810
Where did you want to go, miss?

20:31.021 --> 20:32.147
Mister.

20:33.023 --> 20:34.608
-Yes?
-I'll just get off here.

20:34.775 --> 20:35.651
Here?

20:35.943 --> 20:38.278
I left something behind. I'm sorry.

20:58.298 --> 21:01.885
<i>Today was the first time</i>
<i>that I met Song Ma-rin in real life.</i>

21:03.887 --> 21:06.056
<i>It's also the first time I saved someone</i>

21:06.598 --> 21:09.142
<i>since I started time traveling.</i>

21:09.977 --> 21:12.354
<i>Why will that strange</i>
<i>and absurd woman and I die</i>

21:13.313 --> 21:15.732
<i>on the same day and time?</i>

21:16.692 --> 21:17.985
<i>I'll have to look into it.</i>

21:18.568 --> 21:21.697
<i>Although I'm not sure</i>
<i>if it is even worth looking into.</i>

21:33.292 --> 21:34.126
Okay.

21:37.170 --> 21:38.046
Bit-na.

21:38.714 --> 21:42.301
Your pose is too Milan-style
for a 9,900 won outfit.

21:42.426 --> 21:43.677
I did some research.

21:43.969 --> 21:47.973
I'm sorry, but that actually
doesn't help with the sales.

21:48.640 --> 21:51.226
You can do that
once you become a designer model.

21:51.310 --> 21:55.439
Let's do the internet shopping mall style.
You're good at it.

21:58.817 --> 22:00.944
When are we going to succeed, Ma-rin?

22:02.404 --> 22:03.280
I don't know.

22:03.697 --> 22:05.490
I'm sure the sun will rise some day.

22:06.491 --> 22:09.328
I'll be wearing 9,900 won clothes

22:09.745 --> 22:12.164
and you'll be photographing
9,900 won clothes forever.

22:12.873 --> 22:14.750
Are we going to end like this?

22:16.043 --> 22:18.211
Oh my! You look so cute.

22:18.420 --> 22:20.130
Relax your face a little bit.

22:21.089 --> 22:24.468
Bit-na, let's try not to think
about the worries in our life.

22:25.093 --> 22:28.263
"I have no worries, no thoughts."

22:28.347 --> 22:30.349
Show me an expression like that.

22:30.432 --> 22:31.266
Okay!

22:31.933 --> 22:33.643
Okay, good!

22:36.229 --> 22:37.689
You definitely will succeed.

22:38.732 --> 22:39.858
-Next outfit.
-Okay.

22:48.700 --> 22:49.534
What now?

22:49.618 --> 22:51.286
<i>Bap-soon. What are you doing today?</i>

22:51.912 --> 22:53.163
I'm busy. Bye.

22:53.246 --> 22:55.749
Why are you always so busy?

22:55.832 --> 22:58.001
Always busy.
You're the busiest person ever.

22:59.378 --> 23:02.381
I just have so many things to buy today.

23:02.672 --> 23:03.799
Thank you.

23:04.633 --> 23:07.094
-Help me carry everything.
-Am I your servant?

23:07.844 --> 23:09.346
You're getting more shameless.

23:09.679 --> 23:12.182
Would I ask you
without offering anything in return?

23:12.474 --> 23:13.767
It's obvious you'd say no.

23:14.309 --> 23:16.478
<i>Gun-sook, I'm really busy today.</i>

23:17.270 --> 23:21.691
You gave my wedding photographer
that portfolio, right?

23:23.485 --> 23:25.695
Did you hear something?

23:26.113 --> 23:27.823
I spoke to my Yong-jin about it.

23:27.948 --> 23:29.950
He said he'd put in a good word.

23:30.409 --> 23:32.994
You'll be here soon, right?
I don't have a lot of time.

23:37.249 --> 23:38.542
You're so petty.

23:39.126 --> 23:40.460
I don't need a good word.

23:40.794 --> 23:42.879
I'm scared to get in
through your connections.

23:43.505 --> 23:46.591
Who knows what I'll go through.
I trust my talent.

23:48.760 --> 23:50.637
Hurry along, would you?

23:50.887 --> 23:52.639
You're so slow.

23:54.599 --> 23:57.602
My Yong-jin is a real estate star.

23:58.019 --> 24:00.730
Have you heard of Myreits?
Probably not.

24:01.106 --> 24:03.650
He's the director
of that real estate investment company.

24:03.733 --> 24:05.652
Why is everything so expensive?

24:05.986 --> 24:08.321
They're not plates. They're works of art.

24:08.530 --> 24:11.825
That photographer made a lot of money,
thanks to my Yong-jin.

24:12.492 --> 24:15.662
She's just dying
to be on good terms with him.

24:16.037 --> 24:18.373
That's why she took our wedding photos.

24:18.623 --> 24:19.583
Artist?

24:20.542 --> 24:23.086
Everyone is the same
when it comes to liking money.

24:23.962 --> 24:28.633
I'm just curious to know
what she thought about my pictures.

24:29.468 --> 24:32.596
It's a little shamefu
to ask something like that.

24:34.681 --> 24:35.807
See?

24:35.891 --> 24:38.018
You should have settled by now!

24:38.101 --> 24:40.687
I'm embarrassed.
I'm embarrassed to face Yong-jin.

24:40.770 --> 24:42.606
Are you going to ask or not?

24:42.814 --> 24:46.109
We should take what we offered,
like all the other times.

24:46.193 --> 24:49.404
A deal should be definite
and carried out swiftly.

24:49.779 --> 24:51.907
Why don't you forget that dream
and get married?

24:51.990 --> 24:55.243
Oh, yeah. Yong-jin has a secretary
who runs his errands.

24:55.327 --> 24:56.495
Should I introduce you?

24:57.245 --> 24:58.330
Errands?

24:58.413 --> 25:00.457
Yes. He's very good at them.

25:01.750 --> 25:04.252
Why, you little...
What are you going to buy?

25:04.336 --> 25:05.712
-Hurry up!
-You're nuts!

25:05.795 --> 25:08.215
Buy plates, pots, silverware and what?

25:08.340 --> 25:09.883
Pick now.

25:09.966 --> 25:10.800
Are you crazy?

25:11.635 --> 25:13.970
I'm only looking.
I'm going to buy it with my mom.

25:14.387 --> 25:17.098
Then why did you call me?
To rub salt in my wound?

25:17.641 --> 25:19.142
Buy it! Buy everything.

25:20.143 --> 25:21.520
Oh, here we are.

25:22.395 --> 25:24.898
These are expensive for no reason,
just your style.

25:25.398 --> 25:28.443
I'm not buying it. Let go.
I'm going to tell on you to Yong-jin.

25:28.652 --> 25:30.278
Yong-jin is not here!

25:30.362 --> 25:31.279
Excuse me.

25:31.404 --> 25:34.866
Do you have plates that make you wonder,
"who'd pay this much for them?"

25:34.950 --> 25:37.244
She'll buy them.
She really likes stuff like that.

25:37.827 --> 25:40.038
Yes, we have many in here.
Follow me.

25:40.747 --> 25:41.581
Okay.

25:53.885 --> 25:56.555
Good morning. Be careful what you say.

25:56.638 --> 25:58.723
-Yes, don't worry.
-Okay.

26:03.144 --> 26:04.563
Wait! Hold on.

26:04.646 --> 26:08.191
Hold... Hello, Director.
Have you eaten?

26:08.275 --> 26:09.734
You're going up with us?

26:11.903 --> 26:13.613
We're in a rush.

26:13.697 --> 26:14.739
Can't I get in?

26:14.823 --> 26:16.157
Get the next one.

26:17.867 --> 26:20.412
-Hello, Chairman.
-Hello!

26:22.247 --> 26:23.373
You're going up with me?

26:25.000 --> 26:26.126
You can go on first.

26:26.209 --> 26:28.044
I'm only joking.

26:28.128 --> 26:30.463
You don't think I'm that childish, do you?

26:32.882 --> 26:34.426
We'll head up now.

26:40.056 --> 26:41.766
I heard you're getting married.

26:41.891 --> 26:42.767
Yes.

26:44.227 --> 26:46.855
-Your second marriage?
-No.

26:47.480 --> 26:48.440
Then the third?

26:48.648 --> 26:50.275
You're very skilled.

26:51.651 --> 26:53.903
It's my first-- my first marriage.

26:55.322 --> 26:56.990
You enjoyed being single!

26:57.157 --> 26:58.742
You are economical, as always.

27:00.869 --> 27:04.247
Your bride is not ten years younger
or anything, right?

27:04.998 --> 27:06.625
That would be like robbery.

27:07.751 --> 27:09.419
Actually, she is.

27:10.295 --> 27:11.129
Wow.

27:11.713 --> 27:12.547
Wow.

27:14.966 --> 27:15.842
Hold your thumb up.

27:17.510 --> 27:18.762
-Wow!
-Hey!

27:22.140 --> 27:23.683
As you can see,

27:24.267 --> 27:27.228
the second stage of construction
will be complete in 2025.

27:27.312 --> 27:31.191
Then Jangho City will connect
metropolitan cities to Chungcheong.

27:31.608 --> 27:35.153
It is only normal
that development should've started.

27:35.737 --> 27:37.280
There is a low population.

27:37.447 --> 27:40.492
There are almost no passers-by.

27:40.617 --> 27:42.744
So everyone was waiting.

27:43.328 --> 27:47.499
However, according to my data,
now is the time to go in.

27:47.582 --> 27:50.835
There's been a lot of talk
about Jangho for a long time.

27:50.919 --> 27:53.046
But we don't know
if a highway will be built.

27:53.129 --> 27:55.256
Director Wang, trust me.

27:55.507 --> 27:57.550
I have very good sources.
You can get in.

27:57.634 --> 27:59.010
Do you have a firm basis?

27:59.094 --> 28:03.556
Starting earlier this year,
the cost of the land has been changing.

28:04.099 --> 28:08.353
That is a place where
the land price shouldn't be changing.

28:08.770 --> 28:09.813
What does this mean?

28:09.938 --> 28:11.898
That things
are starting to change there.

28:11.981 --> 28:16.236
That's because of rumors,
and people being tickled by them.

28:16.319 --> 28:18.405
If we continue being lukewarm...

28:20.990 --> 28:22.784
Baekje Group will buy all the land.

28:23.243 --> 28:24.494
-Baekje Group?
-Yes.

28:25.745 --> 28:27.372
This is off the record.

28:29.582 --> 28:32.877
They are in the process
of building a large outlet.

28:33.086 --> 28:34.546
-What?
-Oh!

28:34.629 --> 28:37.298
-Did you know this?
-No, I didn't.

28:37.382 --> 28:39.384
That's news to me.

28:39.509 --> 28:41.553
Really? Why didn't you know?

28:41.970 --> 28:44.889
We might already be a little late on it.

28:45.849 --> 28:47.851
We should go in even now.

28:48.143 --> 28:51.980
That place doesn't look good to me.

28:56.526 --> 28:58.820
In my opinion...

29:00.155 --> 29:03.324
It's near Jangho.

29:05.160 --> 29:07.078
Here. Let's go with it.

29:09.956 --> 29:12.208
-Here?
-Yes, there. There.

29:12.292 --> 29:14.502
That's in the middle
of the mountains, Chairman.

29:14.586 --> 29:15.795
Oh, really?

29:15.879 --> 29:17.547
That's great.

29:17.630 --> 29:19.007
The land must be cheap there.

29:19.090 --> 29:22.218
-What's the assessed value?
-What will you do with the mountains?

29:22.302 --> 29:23.595
It's just a feeling.

29:23.678 --> 29:24.512
Chairman.

29:25.388 --> 29:28.725
Would I be trying to empty
the pockets of investors over a feeling?

29:29.392 --> 29:30.935
According to my information...

29:33.354 --> 29:34.939
this is where we'll make a killing.

29:36.900 --> 29:38.526
Quietly and quickly.

29:39.235 --> 29:40.111
You know, right?

29:41.905 --> 29:46.326
Then we need to know where you got
the information so that we understand.

29:47.911 --> 29:51.331
Then can you share where you get
your information, Director Kim?

29:53.500 --> 29:56.628
Compared to the tips you've gathered
drinking and playing golf,

29:56.878 --> 30:00.465
my tips have always been more correct.

30:01.132 --> 30:04.260
You cannot always work in this manner.

30:04.344 --> 30:06.346
-It's not right.
-I'll tell you eventually.

30:06.429 --> 30:08.515
-Jangho is...
-Just trust me.

30:08.598 --> 30:12.227
-I had absolute info, so I presented it.
-I can guarantee it.

30:12.310 --> 30:14.562
-I had data.
-Jeez.

30:14.646 --> 30:16.773
-Chairman...
-It doesn't feel right.

30:20.193 --> 30:22.028
It doesn't have the right energy.

30:22.904 --> 30:26.032
There's no feel to it. It's no good.

30:27.200 --> 30:28.743
Let's end the meeting here.

30:39.838 --> 30:41.714
Wow, he is really something.

30:42.006 --> 30:45.093
Why do we bother with meetings
if he's going to be this way?

30:45.176 --> 30:48.471
If he puts a circle on a map,
is that everything?

30:48.680 --> 30:51.015
We already know he's good at what he does.

30:51.516 --> 30:54.894
Director, about the chairman...

30:54.978 --> 30:55.895
Secretary Hwang.

30:57.146 --> 30:59.774
I don't know where Chairman Yu
gets his information.

30:59.858 --> 31:01.734
Does he have some connection?

31:01.860 --> 31:03.069
Is he really an orphan?

31:03.361 --> 31:04.612
I thought about it,

31:04.696 --> 31:09.576
he must be an illegitimate son
of a rich family or politician...

31:09.826 --> 31:12.954
He must have some hidden secrets
about his birth--

31:13.037 --> 31:13.913
Enough!

31:15.206 --> 31:16.791
-I'll--
-That's enough!

31:18.001 --> 31:19.335
I'll shut up.

31:21.379 --> 31:24.841
Go easy on him.
Director Kim Yong-jin works the hardest.

31:24.924 --> 31:27.385
If we do what Director Kim says,
we won't make money.

31:27.886 --> 31:30.805
The plans will change in a few months,
just like I said.

31:31.306 --> 31:35.310
-You could make him understand.
-Should I say I saw it in the future?

31:37.186 --> 31:39.188
You could go to the meetings for me.

31:40.481 --> 31:42.984
Right? Should we do that?

31:43.860 --> 31:46.195
Do you want to go in my place?

31:47.030 --> 31:47.906
Hey.

31:48.823 --> 31:49.741
Hey.

31:50.450 --> 31:53.912
-Hey, Ki-doong!
-What? What do you want?

31:55.580 --> 31:58.458
-I'll tell you the lottery numbers.
-I don't believe you.

31:59.000 --> 32:02.462
Four, eight, nine, 15, 23, 29.

32:03.212 --> 32:06.132
Is that right?
Four, eight, nine,  13, 15...

32:06.466 --> 32:08.885
I said I don't believe you.
Don't say those things.

32:08.968 --> 32:12.221
You said you'll never tell me,
and I would never win.

32:12.305 --> 32:13.598
Stop joking around.

32:16.017 --> 32:17.810
-Those are fake, right?
-Of course.

32:17.894 --> 32:20.104
-You jerk!
-Why would I memorize that?

32:21.147 --> 32:23.942
If I get involved,
your life could get ruined.

32:24.108 --> 32:28.237
If I alter your life even a little,
your life could be ruined.

32:28.363 --> 32:31.783
I know.
You don't get involved in other's lives.

32:33.076 --> 32:37.956
But I got involved in someone's life
the other day.

32:38.122 --> 32:38.998
What?

32:40.166 --> 32:43.503
I knew about an accident,
so I saved someone.

32:43.586 --> 32:44.754
Like a total hero.

32:44.837 --> 32:45.672
You?

32:46.005 --> 32:49.926
So, I saw the accident in the future.

32:50.009 --> 32:51.594
Once I save that person,

32:51.678 --> 32:56.891
shouldn't I feel proud, cool,
and like a real man?

32:57.308 --> 32:58.893
Imagine if people knew.

32:59.060 --> 33:02.730
People would line up
asking me to save the world, begging.

33:02.814 --> 33:06.067
"Save me from this and that."
It would be chaotic.

33:06.192 --> 33:09.237
What kind of trouble did you cause?

33:10.279 --> 33:12.573
I just can't stop thinking about it.

33:14.826 --> 33:15.827
Someone you know?

33:16.995 --> 33:17.829
A woman?

33:18.371 --> 33:19.414
I don't know her.

33:20.373 --> 33:21.207
Yes, a woman.

33:21.290 --> 33:22.250
A woman?

33:24.293 --> 33:25.920
Why is it a woman like that?

33:29.465 --> 33:30.341
Is she pretty?

33:35.304 --> 33:36.222
A little.

33:36.305 --> 33:37.849
She must be pretty.

33:37.932 --> 33:39.142
No.

33:39.517 --> 33:41.561
Oh, what is she then? Is she cute?

33:44.063 --> 33:46.357
I should just remove the molding.

33:50.445 --> 33:53.573
I drank so much!

33:56.534 --> 34:00.955
Still, it was better that I drank at home
instead of passing out outside.

34:02.165 --> 34:04.250
Let's cut down a little bit.

34:04.584 --> 34:07.253
No, I want to drink more.

34:15.636 --> 34:16.763
It looks like a rag now.

34:20.558 --> 34:22.351
It's not like anyone's going to see it.

34:23.227 --> 34:26.022
Buy some lingerie with the money
you spend on alcohol.

34:26.314 --> 34:29.275
No, I'm going to drink to death.

34:30.068 --> 34:34.489
"Brother, give me 1,500 won
so I can buy soju."

34:43.247 --> 34:44.332
Why is this here?

35:07.313 --> 35:08.189
Hello?

35:10.274 --> 35:11.150
What?

35:14.278 --> 35:15.113
Yes.

35:20.284 --> 35:21.702
<i>This is Sinbi Studio.</i>

35:21.911 --> 35:23.663
<i>You submitted your portfolio, right?</i>

35:24.163 --> 35:26.332
<i>Congratulations.You've been accepted.</i>

35:26.457 --> 35:28.292
SINBI STUDIO

35:28.376 --> 35:32.004
You can look over the curriculum
and the academy introduction.

35:32.171 --> 35:35.133
You have to attend
the orientation in order to register.

35:35.216 --> 35:36.342
Hold on, please.

35:37.301 --> 35:40.972
Are you saying that I got accepted
into the academy school?

35:41.055 --> 35:42.390
Yes, the academy school.

35:42.473 --> 35:43.474
That's weird.

35:43.891 --> 35:45.476
I got a call saying I was accepted.

35:45.560 --> 35:47.019
Yes, accepted into the academy.

35:47.854 --> 35:49.564
Not as a studio assistant?

35:50.022 --> 35:50.857
Excuse me?

35:51.399 --> 35:52.859
-Take this.
-Yes.

35:53.276 --> 35:54.610
I booked it for 6:00 p.m.

35:54.694 --> 35:55.570
Okay.

35:59.323 --> 36:00.825
Hello again.

36:01.075 --> 36:03.578
Are you taking classes?
I'll see you often.

36:05.079 --> 36:07.915
I applied to be your assistant.

36:08.124 --> 36:09.792
Did you see my portfolio?

36:09.876 --> 36:11.544
You're right at this level.

36:11.627 --> 36:13.504
You need to go to an academy.

36:13.588 --> 36:14.755
Is there a problem?

36:19.135 --> 36:20.720
Should I be a little more honest?

36:22.972 --> 36:24.765
I don't trust people like you.

36:25.850 --> 36:28.352
Playing with a camera to look cool
and for vanity.

36:29.187 --> 36:30.438
I've seen so many of you.

36:34.525 --> 36:36.986
I don't know why you have
the wrong idea about me.

36:37.528 --> 36:39.822
You didn't make it in front of the camera,

36:39.906 --> 36:41.782
so you chose this line of work, no?

36:41.991 --> 36:44.035
You lived your life getting attention,

36:44.118 --> 36:46.495
and it's embarrassing
living a normal life.

36:46.704 --> 36:49.707
You feel like you have to do
something glamorous to feel respected.

36:49.790 --> 36:54.587
"I should just move
from in front of the camera to behind it."

36:54.921 --> 36:56.672
That's what it looks like to me.

36:57.048 --> 37:00.760
-That's a preconception.
-My preconceptions are usually correct.

37:06.432 --> 37:08.351
You think
what you see is what you get.

37:10.728 --> 37:14.899
Your pictures made me feel something
that couldn't be seen.

37:15.358 --> 37:16.776
That's why I was your fan.

37:17.777 --> 37:19.820
That's why I liked your pictures.

37:21.364 --> 37:23.741
But you believe
that what you see is everything.

37:25.785 --> 37:27.912
The reason I want to take pictures...

37:28.704 --> 37:30.373
is because what you see is not all.

37:30.456 --> 37:32.708
-Bap-soon.
-My name is Song Ma-rin!

37:33.459 --> 37:35.002
If you have any pride,

37:35.711 --> 37:38.047
don't ask your friend to get you a job.

37:38.756 --> 37:41.592
You tried to get in
through those connections, and what?

37:41.968 --> 37:43.678
What I see is not everything?

37:44.762 --> 37:45.888
How pretentious.

38:22.133 --> 38:23.342
<i>Seven years ago...</i>

38:24.844 --> 38:28.055
<i>I was reborn here.</i>

38:30.433 --> 38:32.977
Excuse me.
Did you just take a picture of me?

38:33.144 --> 38:35.313
Why are you doing it without permission?

38:35.396 --> 38:39.984
<i>I got into an argument with someone,</i>
<i>so I got off at Namyeong Station.</i>

38:40.067 --> 38:41.444
Delete those pictures.

38:44.655 --> 38:47.366
<i>Miraculously, I ended up living.</i>

38:48.576 --> 38:50.745
<i>Every now and then, I have these thoughts.</i>

38:51.829 --> 38:56.000
<i>Isn't there a reason that I was saved?</i>

38:57.001 --> 39:01.922
<i>Is there a more special future</i>
<i>awaiting me?</i>

39:03.549 --> 39:04.884
<i>I wish that were true.</i>

39:34.038 --> 39:34.997
What a coincidence.

39:37.083 --> 39:38.417
Do people meet like this?

39:39.085 --> 39:42.463
<i>-This stop is Namyeong.</i>
-It's amazing.

39:43.255 --> 39:45.674
<i>The door is on your right.</i>

39:50.096 --> 39:50.971
Are you going home?

39:56.018 --> 39:59.146
-You're just going to leave?
-Yes, I guess we meet again.

39:59.939 --> 40:01.023
Let's go together.

40:01.857 --> 40:02.858
You go ahead.

40:03.401 --> 40:06.987
It's fate that we met again.
Let's have dinner together.

40:07.905 --> 40:09.365
You keep touching me.

40:10.324 --> 40:11.158
What?

40:12.118 --> 40:16.664
Last time, you touched my wrist two times
and then tried to make me lie down.

40:16.747 --> 40:17.581
Now, again.

40:18.582 --> 40:21.794
I wish you wouldn't do this.
We don't know each other.

40:23.087 --> 40:25.756
You're very detailed.
You were keeping count.

40:25.965 --> 40:28.092
Yes, I'm conservative like that.

40:28.175 --> 40:31.387
Isn't it correct to say
I grabbed you, not touched?

40:31.804 --> 40:34.640
Yo're very racy
for a conservative person.

40:36.767 --> 40:39.562
Are you from abroad? Are you?

40:40.604 --> 40:42.148
Made in USA?

40:44.191 --> 40:47.653
You're touchy and friendly with someone
you ran into by chance.

40:47.736 --> 40:49.071
You're very liberal.

40:50.739 --> 40:51.991
I didn't really learn

40:52.074 --> 40:55.327
if I'm supposed to acknowledge you
in this situation.

40:55.911 --> 40:56.745
Bye then.

40:58.247 --> 41:01.125
Is that guy trying to sell me something,
or what?

41:04.545 --> 41:06.422
I'll only say a brief hello today.

41:07.214 --> 41:08.799
There's a weird man following me.

41:09.717 --> 41:12.303
I didn't know people still stop by here.

41:14.346 --> 41:15.306
What's he saying?

41:15.389 --> 41:16.849
I'll buy dinner.

41:17.433 --> 41:19.643
Isn't there a conservative place to eat?

41:21.729 --> 41:24.315
This isn't going right.
It will cause a big problem.

41:26.150 --> 41:28.986
Let's go for a drink!
Let's drink together.

41:38.496 --> 41:40.080
One pint of beer, please!

41:42.791 --> 41:43.792
Thank you.

41:47.254 --> 41:51.050
Slow down with your drinking.
The appetizers aren't even out yet.

41:51.675 --> 41:52.927
I'm shy with new people.

41:55.513 --> 41:57.348
I can only drink beer.

41:58.057 --> 42:00.643
Soju is... too bitter.

42:02.144 --> 42:02.978
I see.

42:04.104 --> 42:06.023
I'm drinking with someone
I don't know.

42:06.899 --> 42:08.234
This is a fun experience.

42:10.528 --> 42:11.529
Serve the appetizers.

42:12.029 --> 42:13.906
I'm not a woman
who eats appetizers.

42:15.574 --> 42:16.534
You're not...

42:17.535 --> 42:18.744
You're conservative too.

42:19.954 --> 42:21.121
What work do you do?

42:22.957 --> 42:24.458
I just take pictures.

42:24.875 --> 42:25.793
How old are you?

42:27.002 --> 42:29.505
-Why do you want to know?
-I'm just curious.

42:29.922 --> 42:31.173
Why are you curious?

42:31.549 --> 42:33.342
Do people need a reason?

42:36.804 --> 42:38.639
Let's get up after this.

42:39.807 --> 42:40.683
Cheers.

42:52.861 --> 42:54.947
I don't look like I'm 31 years old, do I?

42:55.823 --> 42:57.366
You look exactly that age.

42:59.285 --> 43:00.411
How old are you?

43:00.744 --> 43:01.579
I'm 19.

43:02.746 --> 43:04.123
That's a lie. I'm 30.

43:07.459 --> 43:08.794
Do you have a job?

43:12.548 --> 43:13.924
You must be unemployed.

43:16.176 --> 43:17.219
It's okay.

43:17.803 --> 43:21.807
Eventually, people manage to crawl
their way into some company.

43:21.890 --> 43:22.808
It's okay.

43:25.561 --> 43:29.648
I'm the CEO of a pretty good
real estate investment company.

43:30.733 --> 43:34.820
It's pretty big.
I don't want to say it so bluntly.

43:37.031 --> 43:38.824
You've succeeded at a young age.

43:39.533 --> 43:41.243
You have your own real estate agency.

43:42.161 --> 43:43.287
Real estate agency...

43:45.414 --> 43:46.415
Hey, Realtor.

43:49.126 --> 43:50.669
Why did you do that to me?

43:51.962 --> 43:55.633
You were hitting on me
the first time we saw each other.

43:57.384 --> 43:58.260
Hitting on you?

43:58.344 --> 44:03.223
You were being very awkward,
touching me and pulling me, like this...

44:03.349 --> 44:05.184
Can you give it a rest already?

44:05.934 --> 44:07.895
Has no one approached you before?

44:07.978 --> 44:09.938
Why do you keep repeating yourself?

44:10.564 --> 44:13.067
I must have made quite the impression.

44:13.776 --> 44:16.153
Or... did you not like it?

44:18.238 --> 44:21.283
Look at you going into a rage.
It's all right.

44:22.117 --> 44:23.619
Big Sis understands.

44:26.622 --> 44:29.208
Don't... misunderstand
by making that expression.

44:29.291 --> 44:31.293
You don't understand.

44:36.173 --> 44:37.341
Jeez...

44:45.808 --> 44:48.936
I'm not going home.
I'm just going to the restroom.

44:50.312 --> 44:52.022
One more beer, please!

44:57.069 --> 44:58.904
I order before I go,
so there's no wait.

44:58.987 --> 45:00.823
Let's have one more and go. Okay?

45:10.624 --> 45:13.460
-What are you doing in here?
-I'm sorry. The door is broken.

45:13.544 --> 45:15.379
Hold onto it. Hold it!

45:15.462 --> 45:16.922
I am holding it.

45:17.005 --> 45:21.009
You have to hold it.
You're dead if you look.

45:24.972 --> 45:27.558
What a crappy bathroom!

45:28.475 --> 45:30.728
Let's go to the Blue House and complain.

45:30.811 --> 45:32.229
Hey, fix your clothes.

45:32.312 --> 45:33.689
-Your zipper is open.
-What?

45:36.650 --> 45:39.069
You're so cute. So cute.

45:39.153 --> 45:40.946
My zipper is open...

45:49.538 --> 45:50.414
You!

45:51.623 --> 45:53.542
Don't like me too much.

45:54.334 --> 45:56.044
You don't know much about me.

45:56.795 --> 45:57.629
Okay.

45:58.297 --> 45:59.673
I won't ever like you.

46:00.424 --> 46:02.926
I made a big mistake last time.

46:03.844 --> 46:06.388
I must have been crazy.

46:10.726 --> 46:12.394
What was so pretty about me?

46:14.438 --> 46:17.649
I've often heard that my eyes are pretty.

46:17.733 --> 46:21.987
Actually, my legs are really pretty.

46:22.070 --> 46:24.156
If you're so confident,
you can show me.

46:24.782 --> 46:26.575
I'm not an easy woman.

46:26.867 --> 46:28.494
My life wasn't easy either.

46:29.244 --> 46:30.662
Dating is boring.

46:30.746 --> 46:32.289
Loving someone is tiring.

46:32.372 --> 46:34.041
You get what I'm like, right?

46:34.583 --> 46:37.169
I'm a confident and fearless woman.

46:43.133 --> 46:45.552
Should I be even more honest?
Brutally honest?

46:47.012 --> 46:50.557
I only look pure on the outside.
I'm actually all worn out.

46:50.641 --> 46:54.937
So don't like me.
You'll get hurt and scarred.

46:55.020 --> 46:56.438
-That hurts!
-The thing is,

46:56.522 --> 46:59.358
I can be very fatal.

47:00.943 --> 47:03.153
I will just rip your heart to shreds.

47:04.238 --> 47:07.658
I said I liked you twice,
so you follow me around for three days

47:07.950 --> 47:09.201
to tell me not to like you?

47:10.452 --> 47:13.497
I don't think
you're the one to be saying that.

47:14.748 --> 47:16.625
Your friends would probably laugh at you

47:17.125 --> 47:18.418
for dating Bap-soon.

47:20.337 --> 47:22.881
"Isn't that Bap-soon in ruins now?"

47:24.633 --> 47:26.051
"What is she even up to now?"

47:26.885 --> 47:30.597
You'll be so sick of hearing,
"her life didn't turn out well."

47:33.058 --> 47:37.646
People who have nothing to do with me
feel sorry for me and mock me.

47:38.021 --> 47:42.609
You'll have to see them chew me up
like appetizers over their drinks.

47:44.695 --> 47:45.654
Who knows?

47:47.322 --> 47:49.575
You could be one of them.

47:53.662 --> 47:55.914
You have delusions of grandeur.

47:56.415 --> 47:57.249
What did you say?

47:58.625 --> 48:02.880
Aren't you overreacting a bit much
over a little fame?

48:02.963 --> 48:04.214
What would you know?

48:04.298 --> 48:05.382
I don't know.

48:05.465 --> 48:07.551
But other people don't know your life.

48:07.634 --> 48:10.429
People? They don't really care
about other people's lives.

48:10.512 --> 48:12.264
They're busy living their own lives.

48:13.223 --> 48:15.350
You must not have much to do.

48:15.434 --> 48:18.353
You go around listening
to what everyone says.

48:18.770 --> 48:19.730
Are you lecturing me?

48:20.731 --> 48:23.400
Realtor, you're a year younger than me.

48:25.986 --> 48:29.698
You shouldn't be hung up on the past.
Life is shorter than you think.

48:34.077 --> 48:35.662
Are you trying to look manly?

48:35.996 --> 48:38.290
Did you think
my heart would skip a beat?

48:45.547 --> 48:46.632
Tomorrow...

48:48.050 --> 48:51.845
Tomorrow, the sun will rise.

49:10.489 --> 49:14.868
SUDDEN SHOWER ALERTS
THE LARGEST FIREWORK FESTIVAL

49:15.243 --> 49:20.999
MARCH 25, 2019, FUTURE.

49:50.445 --> 49:51.446
Hey!

49:53.323 --> 49:55.659
Let's go. There's no time for you.

49:56.493 --> 49:59.204
That... isn't that me?

49:59.413 --> 50:02.666
That's why!
That's why we have to go to the present.

50:03.291 --> 50:06.044
If that version of you dies,
I don't know what will happen.

50:06.253 --> 50:07.462
You could disappear.

50:07.546 --> 50:09.423
What are you talking about?

50:09.673 --> 50:12.384
I... I'm going to die?

50:14.845 --> 50:17.889
At 9:15 p.m., on March 25, 2019.

50:18.557 --> 50:20.142
That's when you will die.

50:21.893 --> 50:25.313
We don't even have 30 minutes.
Hurry up. Hurry!

50:26.398 --> 50:27.482
NAMYEONG

50:27.566 --> 50:30.235
No wonder. I thought something was off.

50:31.403 --> 50:33.947
March 25, 2019.

50:35.115 --> 50:39.077
I could never go to that day.
Today was the first time I made it.

50:40.579 --> 50:44.249
I could never go beyond that date,
so I knew there must be something.

50:44.541 --> 50:45.375
That was...

50:47.461 --> 50:49.087
because I died.

50:49.713 --> 50:51.131
Wow, crazy.

50:51.923 --> 50:53.341
How absurd.

50:54.301 --> 50:56.595
Not dying would be more absurd.

50:57.429 --> 50:59.264
Isn't dying a certainty?

51:00.223 --> 51:02.392
I'm going to live another 50 years.

51:02.726 --> 51:04.728
I'm going to live longer than you.

51:05.854 --> 51:06.980
Live long, kid.

51:07.981 --> 51:09.900
You're kind of annoying.

51:12.736 --> 51:16.323
Why don't you try looking for that girl?

51:18.658 --> 51:22.913
The girl who was in the accident with you
and died at the same time.

51:26.083 --> 51:28.251
We die together?

51:30.629 --> 51:32.506
In the emergency room, at the same time.

51:33.131 --> 51:36.301
I don't know who she is.
I didn't get a good look at her face.

51:36.426 --> 51:39.471
That's why I'm saying
you should look for her.

51:41.139 --> 51:43.975
<i>She's the only person</i>
<i>who is connected to your death.</i>

51:44.059 --> 51:44.976
<i>You never know.</i>

51:45.393 --> 51:48.522
<i>She may hold the key to saving you.</i>

51:51.358 --> 51:55.112
<i>You only have three years left.</i>

52:02.077 --> 52:04.204
You horrible, dirty person!

52:06.957 --> 52:08.250
Do you know what you did?

52:10.627 --> 52:11.670
I'm sure you do.

52:15.132 --> 52:17.134
Why do I remember everything?

52:20.137 --> 52:22.055
I didn't say my legs are pretty,
did I?

52:22.722 --> 52:25.684
No, I didn't go that far.

52:29.980 --> 52:31.857
I did. I did say it.

52:50.834 --> 52:52.002
Crap.

52:54.379 --> 52:56.256
Oh my. What's wrong with me?

52:57.632 --> 52:58.884
I must be crazy.

52:58.967 --> 52:59.968
How dirty.

53:00.594 --> 53:02.053
Oh, how pathetic.

53:04.764 --> 53:05.932
It wasn't me.

53:07.142 --> 53:10.478
I don't want it to be me.
It's not me. It's not.

53:33.627 --> 53:35.629
The realtor will say that I'm crazy.

53:37.464 --> 53:40.550
It's not like I'll see him again.
I'll just ignore him.

53:40.800 --> 53:43.220
It's fine. I'll be reborn starting today.

53:51.228 --> 53:52.062
I feel like dying.

53:53.772 --> 53:55.190
Oh, my head!

53:56.399 --> 53:57.943
Do you really think

53:58.526 --> 54:00.946
that strange woman
holds a key to my life?

54:02.614 --> 54:05.200
Well, we will have to wait and see.

54:06.534 --> 54:10.455
As of now, I have no other choice
but to know more about her.

54:10.664 --> 54:12.874
At least it's a woman and not a man.

54:14.834 --> 54:16.294
She's pretty!

54:16.378 --> 54:18.213
I care more about inner attributes.

54:19.589 --> 54:21.591
Nonsense. Put some spit on those lips.

54:21.675 --> 54:23.134
Stop, that's gross.

54:24.302 --> 54:27.264
I'm serious. It's not like
you'll live together. Why worry?

54:27.639 --> 54:28.473
Right?

54:28.932 --> 54:31.851
Just enough so that we're not too close.

54:32.519 --> 54:34.771
It would be best to keep it like that.

54:35.522 --> 54:38.608
-Who is she talking to?
-Wait here a minute.

54:57.335 --> 54:59.879
Oh, the skies are very clear.

54:59.963 --> 55:01.423
And the air is very fresh.

55:02.215 --> 55:03.717
I see that Seoul is still alive.

55:03.800 --> 55:05.677
Oh, I ran into you by chance again!

55:07.178 --> 55:09.848
Oh! What brings you here?

55:09.931 --> 55:12.559
I just happened to be walking by
and ran into you.

55:14.936 --> 55:17.814
Isn't it a bit much to say
you were walking by here...

55:23.320 --> 55:27.365
-I was very drunk yesterday, wasn't I?
-Since I ran into you, I should apologize.

55:28.283 --> 55:31.828
Sorry if I did anything wrong yesterday.
I blacked out.

55:33.455 --> 55:34.539
<i>You </i>blacked out?

55:34.622 --> 55:35.957
I don't remember a thing.

55:38.126 --> 55:40.253
Really? Not a thing?

55:40.337 --> 55:41.212
Yes, not a thing.

55:41.963 --> 55:45.383
Should I try to remember...

55:45.467 --> 55:46.676
-Or not?
-Not.

55:48.470 --> 55:51.514
-Why are you dropping honorifics?
-I don't know... well...

55:52.724 --> 55:55.226
I don't remember anything,
but my speech has changed.

55:55.602 --> 55:57.479
We must have gotten very close yesterday.

55:59.647 --> 56:02.442
-Then let's meet again.
-Yes.

56:02.525 --> 56:03.485
By chance.

56:09.282 --> 56:10.784
He wasn't drunk at all.

56:13.328 --> 56:15.080
I forgot to give you this.

56:15.288 --> 56:16.873
Take it. You'll need it.

56:19.167 --> 56:20.668
It's not supposed to rain today.

56:21.419 --> 56:23.630
I checked the weather for my photo shoot.

56:24.089 --> 56:26.716
There's a chance it could rain.

56:34.516 --> 56:36.309
The weather really is nice.

56:53.576 --> 56:54.744
I need to ask a favor--

56:55.745 --> 56:56.955
Where did he go?

56:58.123 --> 56:59.749
You look pretty. That's great!

57:00.083 --> 57:01.000
Okay!

57:03.711 --> 57:04.546
Bit-na.

57:05.505 --> 57:08.091
How are you so good at these expressions?

57:08.758 --> 57:09.843
Are you meditating?

57:10.635 --> 57:12.220
Your expressions are like zen.

57:13.972 --> 57:14.889
You're the best!

57:15.932 --> 57:17.016
Thank you, Ma-rin.

57:17.183 --> 57:18.017
For what?

57:18.268 --> 57:21.980
I heard the president wanted me fired,
and you stopped him.

57:23.481 --> 57:25.108
You only heard about that today?

57:25.775 --> 57:29.654
Bad rumors spread so quickly.

57:29.737 --> 57:33.575
Why is it that a beautiful,
moving story doesn't get spread?

57:34.951 --> 57:36.244
You should spread it around.

57:36.953 --> 57:38.121
Thank you.

57:38.997 --> 57:41.207
You better take me with you
once you succeed.

57:41.332 --> 57:44.294
We have to help each other.

57:47.338 --> 57:48.339
Oh no!

57:50.049 --> 57:52.051
-Get the gear inside, now!
-Yes.

58:40.642 --> 58:42.185
Are you okay? I have to go.

58:42.268 --> 58:43.645
What's up with this rain?

58:43.728 --> 58:45.021
I told you it would rain.

58:45.104 --> 58:47.524
Should we make a weather app?

58:47.607 --> 58:50.485
No, the weather forecasters
would be out of business.

58:50.568 --> 58:51.986
I'm headed out now.

58:52.070 --> 58:53.696
Again? To the other world.

58:53.780 --> 58:55.990
You're going to the other world
too often lately.

58:56.074 --> 58:57.033
Other world?

58:57.116 --> 59:00.495
That is an odd way to put it.
Am I going to the world of the dead?

59:00.578 --> 59:02.497
-Where are you going?
-The other world.

59:04.332 --> 59:06.167
Rice wine and fried pancakes later?

59:06.251 --> 59:07.085
Sounds good!

59:07.210 --> 59:08.586
-Clean up.
-Okay!

59:10.213 --> 59:11.297
It's so cold.

59:12.465 --> 59:14.008
Rice wine. Yes.

59:15.718 --> 59:19.931
THREE MONTHS LATER, FUTURE

59:25.478 --> 59:26.312
What is this?

1:00:02.765 --> 1:00:04.642
How did he know?

1:00:35.048 --> 1:00:36.007
Realtor?

1:00:39.052 --> 1:00:41.137
Oh! You're home already?

1:00:43.014 --> 1:00:45.224
You're not supposed to be off work
so soon.

1:00:46.851 --> 1:00:48.978
You're making it obvious
that we're newlyweds.

1:00:52.857 --> 1:00:55.109
New... newlywed?

1:00:55.985 --> 1:00:58.446
Stop looking at me like that.

1:00:58.529 --> 1:00:59.656
It makes me feel shy.

1:01:01.199 --> 1:01:04.744
We... we're newlyweds?

1:01:51.624 --> 1:01:55.294
<i>It wasn't three years later,</i>
<i>but three months!</i>

1:01:55.378 --> 1:01:58.589
<i>You only have three years left.</i>

1:01:58.840 --> 1:02:02.760
So, this is how it feels.
So awkward. What do I do?

1:02:02.844 --> 1:02:05.596
Whatever the reason is,
I shouldn't get involved.

1:02:06.013 --> 1:02:10.184
<i>Dying on the same day at the same time</i>
<i>is an incredible fate.</i>

1:02:10.852 --> 1:02:13.813
<i>What was I blinded by</i>
<i>that I married this woman?</i>

1:02:14.897 --> 1:02:16.274
<i>What is this?</i>

1:02:16.983 --> 1:02:19.736
<i>You and I… what's our connection?</i>

1:02:20.111 --> 1:02:23.948
