00:00.055 --> 00:01.453
Previously on
<i>Sanctuary...</i>

00:01.683 --> 00:02.699
Abnormals.

00:02.724 --> 00:03.924
Coming up from
Hollow Earth.

00:03.949 --> 00:04.862
Judging by the images,

00:04.887 --> 00:05.979
they're in need
of our help.

00:06.004 --> 00:08.658
I've asked General Villanova
with the Lotus Defense Corps.

00:08.683 --> 00:10.283
to oversee ground operations.

00:10.308 --> 00:12.019
Turn over the abnormals
to the Sanctuary.

00:12.044 --> 00:14.757
I do own a large vacant lot
not far from here.

00:14.782 --> 00:16.369
The abnormals will be safe

00:16.473 --> 00:17.549
I'm Garris.

00:17.574 --> 00:18.531
Kate...

00:18.556 --> 00:19.551
Leave it to you

00:19.576 --> 00:22.491
to find a cozy <i> seeth</i>
<i>on your first day here.</i>

00:22.493 --> 00:23.693
What did you
call her?

00:23.889 --> 00:25.361
Thelo,
be reasonable.

00:25.385 --> 00:26.678
They're talking about
confinement.

00:26.679 --> 00:27.844
It's for our own safety.

00:28.369 --> 00:29.669
We can take care of ourselves.

00:29.671 --> 00:31.337
Fallon?

00:33.407 --> 00:34.540
What have you done?

00:36.000 --> 00:42.074
Learn the unknown English words
of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

00:43.116 --> 00:44.250
What about Kate?

00:44.252 --> 00:45.451
My men will find her!

00:45.453 --> 00:46.886
Any word from Kate
or Biggie?

00:46.888 --> 00:48.588
No. No communication
in or out.

00:48.590 --> 00:50.022
<i>Dr. Zimmerman,</i>

00:50.024 --> 00:51.157
<i>what's going on</i>
<i>in there?</i>

00:51.159 --> 00:52.658
I was set up.

00:52.660 --> 00:54.126
<i>This has gone far beyond</i>
<i>a Sanctuary matter.</i>

00:54.128 --> 00:56.496
<i>There are hostages.</i>

00:56.498 --> 00:58.164
<i> We have</i>
<i>seized control of the camp.</i>

00:58.166 --> 00:59.632
<i>We want the same rights</i>
<i>and freedoms as you do.</i>

00:59.634 --> 01:01.634
<i>You have two hours</i>
<i>to make arrangements.</i>

01:01.636 --> 01:04.736
<i>After that,</i>
<i>we kill our first hostage.</i>

01:06.440 --> 01:07.573
<i>Dr. Lee, I need</i>
<i>your permission</i>

01:07.575 --> 01:09.408
<i>to assemble</i>
<i>a strike team.</i>

01:09.410 --> 01:12.311
This entire hostage situation
has been a ruse

01:12.313 --> 01:14.213
to disguise
a much larger invasion.

01:14.215 --> 01:15.581
Praxis was the only thing

01:15.583 --> 01:17.383
holding this mass
of Abnormals back.

01:17.385 --> 01:18.751
Now it's gone--

01:18.753 --> 01:19.752
Hang on, we might
already be there.

01:19.754 --> 01:20.753
I'm detecting
a major power build-up

01:20.755 --> 01:21.654
deep below the surface.

01:25.893 --> 01:28.227
Armies, preparing to invade.

01:28.229 --> 01:29.362
Oh, my God.

01:29.364 --> 01:30.530
There's
thousands of them.

01:30.532 --> 01:31.797
<i>Where is Dr. Magnus?</i>

01:31.799 --> 01:32.899
An incident has come up

01:32.901 --> 01:34.500
that has far-reaching
ramifications

01:34.502 --> 01:36.035
on the current situation,

01:36.037 --> 01:37.837
and it's something that only
Magnus herself can deal with.

01:37.839 --> 01:40.006
Don't make things worse, Adam!

01:40.008 --> 01:41.374
Neither of us belongs here.

01:41.376 --> 01:43.910
I'll kill you for this,
I swear!

01:45.646 --> 01:47.813
I'm trapped here,
and I've no way home.

01:47.815 --> 01:50.016
You can always go home.

01:50.018 --> 01:51.684
It just might take
a little while.

01:51.686 --> 01:54.320
113 years of seclusion.

01:54.322 --> 01:57.256
Then you rejoin your timeline
just after you've left it.

02:38.732 --> 02:40.900
They're trying to get
to the hostages!

03:14.334 --> 03:15.501
Pull your men out!

03:15.503 --> 03:17.403
<i>You're asking me</i>
<i>to retreat, son.</i>

03:17.405 --> 03:18.671
No, I'm begging you.

03:18.673 --> 03:19.605
Can't you see
what's going on here?

03:19.607 --> 03:20.439
It's chaos.

03:20.441 --> 03:21.574
<i>Abnormals are dying.</i>

03:21.576 --> 03:22.441
My men are dying.

03:22.443 --> 03:23.943
Because they attacked!

03:23.945 --> 03:25.711
<i>And what about your people?</i>
<i>They're in there too.</i>

03:25.713 --> 03:27.980
Yeah, and they were safe
until you stormed in.

03:27.982 --> 03:28.981
They were hostages.

03:28.983 --> 03:30.383
We had two hours!

03:30.385 --> 03:31.984
And you were running
a side deal with the U.N.

03:31.986 --> 03:33.419
We had to act.

03:33.421 --> 03:35.287
My men stay.

03:37.057 --> 03:39.592
Dude, I got
something--

03:39.594 --> 03:40.893
it's Declan.

03:40.895 --> 03:42.628
His team made it to Magnus'
last known location.

03:42.630 --> 03:43.963
<i> I don't know</i>

03:43.965 --> 03:45.531
<i>if you're receiving</i>
<i>this transmission,</i>

03:45.533 --> 03:48.801
<i>but I arrived in Hollow Earth</i>
<i>today with a recon team.</i>

03:48.803 --> 03:53.539
<i>Praxis has been</i>
<i>completely vaporized.</i>

03:53.541 --> 03:56.308
<i>My guys are searching</i>
<i>the area now,</i>

03:56.310 --> 03:58.711
<i>but I can't believe</i>
<i>anything could have survived.</i>

03:58.713 --> 04:02.715
<i>There's no sign of Druitt,</i>
<i>and...</i>

04:02.717 --> 04:07.353
<i>Though it saddens me to say,</i>
<i>no sign either of Magnus.</i>

04:07.355 --> 04:10.322
<i>I very much fear</i>
<i>she's gone, Will.</i>

Close the gates!

05:14.154 --> 05:15.521
What the hell
are your people doing?

05:15.523 --> 05:17.089
Do they enjoy
being hostages?

05:17.091 --> 05:18.791
Our job
is to protect abnormals.

05:18.793 --> 05:20.626
Even at the cost
of your own lives?

05:20.628 --> 05:21.761
What's the
Sanctuary protocol

05:21.763 --> 05:24.163
for this situation?

05:27.468 --> 05:29.469
Got enough milk and cookies
for all of 'em?

05:29.471 --> 05:30.570
I got her.

05:32.139 --> 05:33.439
<i>Make it fast.</i>

05:33.441 --> 05:34.607
<i>I'm briefing</i>
<i>the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</i>

05:34.609 --> 05:36.209
Dr. Lee, this situation
is out of control.

05:36.211 --> 05:37.777
Have you seen what's happening
at the refugee camp?

05:37.779 --> 05:39.812
<i>General Villanova</i>
<i>is proceeding as directed.</i>

05:39.814 --> 05:41.547
You told him to attack
innocent people?

05:41.549 --> 05:42.882
<i>It was not our side</i>

05:42.884 --> 05:44.851
<i>who showed the first signs</i>
<i>of aggression.</i>

05:44.853 --> 05:46.419
<i>We are the responders,</i>
<i>not the instigators.</i>

05:46.421 --> 05:48.421
When Fallon was murdered,
they got frightened.

05:48.423 --> 05:49.322
<i>They attacked you.</i>

05:49.324 --> 05:50.790
They were confused.

05:50.792 --> 05:51.924
<i>My men were there</i>
<i>as peacekeepers.</i>

05:51.926 --> 05:53.226
<i>The abnormals</i>
<i>took them hostage.</i>

05:53.228 --> 05:54.260
<i>How is that confusing?</i>

05:54.262 --> 05:55.495
I'm just saying

05:55.497 --> 05:57.396
the whole situation
seems oddly convenient.

05:57.398 --> 05:59.265
Thelo walks in,

05:59.267 --> 06:00.733
he sees me standing next to
Fallon's dead body,

06:00.735 --> 06:02.735
and the they riot
and overtake the camp?

06:02.737 --> 06:03.636
To what end?

06:03.638 --> 06:04.837
It's gotta be
a frame-up.

06:04.839 --> 06:06.405
And yet you still
want us to trust them?

06:06.407 --> 06:09.876
<i>I'm talking about</i>
<i>opening up a dialogue.</i>

06:09.878 --> 06:11.677
We're at war.

06:11.679 --> 06:12.712
<i>The general has the support</i>

06:12.714 --> 06:14.013
<i>of the UN Security Council</i>

06:14.015 --> 06:15.248
<i>and several</i>
<i>major agencies worldwide.</i>

06:15.250 --> 06:16.649
<i>With all due respect,</i>

06:16.651 --> 06:18.017
<i>he does not know</i>
<i>what he's doing.</i>

06:18.019 --> 06:21.187
This is our specialty
for the last hundred years.

06:21.189 --> 06:24.323
Give jurisdiction
to the Sanctuary teams.

06:24.325 --> 06:26.192
Let us try
to remedy the situation

06:26.194 --> 06:27.159
before it spirals
any more out of control.

06:27.161 --> 06:28.928
Just let us
do our job.

06:28.930 --> 06:31.831
<i>I'm afraid that moment passed</i>
<i>when the invasion happened.</i>

06:31.833 --> 06:33.165
<i>If you'd provided us</i>
<i>some warning...</i>

06:34.735 --> 06:36.702
<i>Current estimates, General?</i>

06:36.704 --> 06:39.505
<i>9,000 life forms</i>
<i>and counting.</i>

06:39.507 --> 06:41.741
<i>Numbers are growing</i>
<i>every minute.</i>

06:41.743 --> 06:43.109
<i>As you can see</i>
<i>from the SAT feeds,</i>

06:43.111 --> 06:44.510
<i>they're massing,</i>
<i>moving as a unit.</i>

06:44.512 --> 06:45.845
<i>Organizing an attack?</i>

06:45.847 --> 06:47.747
We have to assume that
civilians may be targeted.

06:47.749 --> 06:49.815
<i>Based on what,</i>
<i>that they're abnormals?</i>

06:49.817 --> 06:52.618
That we don't know
who or what they are.

06:52.620 --> 06:53.753
<i>Try asking them!</i>

06:53.755 --> 06:55.721
<i>They don't appear to be armed.</i>

06:55.723 --> 06:57.356
<i>They should be</i>
<i>treated as refugees.</i>

06:57.358 --> 06:58.357
<i>I'm dispatching</i>
<i>reinforcements</i>

06:58.359 --> 06:59.892
<i>to surround the camp,</i>

06:59.894 --> 07:02.194
<i>but my main focus</i>
<i>will be on the Calderas.</i>

07:02.196 --> 07:04.363
<i>Very well, General,</i>
<i>proceed as planned.</i>

07:04.365 --> 07:06.766
I can't believe you're giving
Kilgore here carte blanche!

07:06.768 --> 07:08.601
<i>General, get to work.</i>

07:08.603 --> 07:11.537
Dr. Lee,
just one second--

07:29.685 --> 07:30.919
Hey, hey, hey...

07:30.921 --> 07:33.955
Go to the medical tent.
Get that seen to.

07:49.539 --> 07:50.972
That's enough.

07:50.974 --> 07:55.443
It's over. It's okay.
Stop.

07:55.445 --> 07:56.812
He's dead.

07:56.814 --> 07:59.481
Show some respect.

08:07.290 --> 08:08.757
Any sign of Thelo yet?

08:08.759 --> 08:11.927
Yeah. Over here.

08:18.468 --> 08:20.802
What's going on?

08:20.804 --> 08:21.837
He tried to escape.

08:21.839 --> 08:22.771
Let him go.

08:22.773 --> 08:23.638
You're not Thelo.

08:23.640 --> 08:25.707
Thelo is dead.

08:27.310 --> 08:28.977
Now, let him go.

08:37.919 --> 08:38.986
I appreciate
what you did,

08:38.989 --> 08:40.554
helping us,

08:40.557 --> 08:42.957
but you need to get back
with the other hostages.

08:42.960 --> 08:44.359
I'm looking for someone.

08:46.562 --> 08:48.864
We haven't found Kate yet,
but we will.

08:48.866 --> 08:50.732
Talk to your people.

08:50.734 --> 08:55.370
Release the hostages
before more die.

08:55.372 --> 08:57.873
You must understand,
I didn't--

08:57.875 --> 09:02.544
<i>we</i> didn't want any killing.

09:02.546 --> 09:04.679
It wasn't supposed
to be like this.

09:22.532 --> 09:23.832
Kate!

09:25.334 --> 09:26.635
Sorry.

09:26.637 --> 09:27.502
I thought...

09:28.671 --> 09:30.338
What happened to you?

09:30.340 --> 09:33.775
I just, I bobbed
when I should've weaved.

09:35.044 --> 09:36.611
You know Thelo's dead.

09:36.613 --> 09:38.413
Yes.

09:38.415 --> 09:39.881
And the hostages?

09:39.883 --> 09:40.715
Biggie?

09:40.717 --> 09:42.517
He's alive.

09:42.519 --> 09:43.818
So are most of the others,

09:43.820 --> 09:45.420
and your friend Will,
he got out.

09:47.290 --> 09:48.957
But with Thelo dead,
who's running the show?

09:48.959 --> 09:51.359
No one.

09:51.361 --> 09:53.495
Mob rule?
That's not good.

09:53.497 --> 09:55.530
Everything just...

09:55.532 --> 09:56.631
went crazy.

09:56.633 --> 09:57.666
But your people
can't really believe

09:57.668 --> 09:59.367
we're responsible for
Fallon's death.

09:59.369 --> 10:01.002
- The circumstances--
- Were circumstantial.

10:01.004 --> 10:02.470
I promise you
will didn't kill her.

10:04.440 --> 10:06.408
I believe you.

10:08.010 --> 10:09.811
Then why take hostages?

10:09.813 --> 10:11.546
You've got to know
this is going to end badly.

10:11.548 --> 10:13.081
Listen to me.

10:13.083 --> 10:14.382
You need to be with
the hostages.

10:14.384 --> 10:15.750
No, no,

10:15.752 --> 10:17.018
I need to grab my friend,

10:17.020 --> 10:18.520
haul our asses out of here.

10:18.522 --> 10:19.654
I can handle myself.

10:19.656 --> 10:20.488
Hey!

10:21.458 --> 10:23.425
No one's going anywhere.

10:23.427 --> 10:27.963
Not you,
not the hostages.

10:27.965 --> 10:31.599
Well, looks like someone
just grew a pair.

10:31.601 --> 10:33.935
Please.

10:33.937 --> 10:35.804
Just come with me.

10:40.811 --> 10:45.680
Whatever happens,
I want you to be safe.

10:49.051 --> 10:49.985
Are you nuts?

10:49.987 --> 10:51.086
Come on.

10:51.088 --> 10:52.754
Will, you just
got out of the camp.

10:52.756 --> 10:54.522
Somebody's got to negotiate
with the abnormals,

10:54.524 --> 10:55.857
and with no word
from Magnus...

10:55.859 --> 10:56.891
If she's even--

10:56.893 --> 10:57.993
Look, let's just
not go there, okay?

10:57.995 --> 10:59.527
We both know better.

10:59.529 --> 11:00.929
So what, you're just
gonna waltz back in there?

11:00.931 --> 11:02.063
Do you have
a better idea?

11:02.065 --> 11:03.665
Hang on.

11:03.667 --> 11:05.767
Incoming call,
priority channel.

11:05.769 --> 11:07.002
It's not Magnus.

11:07.004 --> 11:08.069
Who is it?

11:08.071 --> 11:08.970
It's everyone.

11:16.612 --> 11:18.413
Ladies, gentlemen...

11:18.415 --> 11:19.748
<i> Will,</i>
<i>the executive committee</i>

11:19.750 --> 11:21.783
<i>has held an emergency meeting.</i>

11:21.785 --> 11:23.151
About?

11:23.153 --> 11:27.188
<i>Due to Magnus'...</i>
<i>continued absence,</i>

11:27.190 --> 11:30.058
<i>and in accordance with</i>
<i>the laws set forth</i>

11:30.060 --> 11:31.993
<i>in the Sanctuary charter,</i>

11:31.995 --> 11:33.928
<i>we've come to a decision.</i>

11:35.765 --> 11:38.133
<i>Effective immediately,</i>

11:38.135 --> 11:39.934
<i>we hereby appoint you</i>

11:39.936 --> 11:42.637
<i>as acting head of the global</i>
<i>Sanctuary network.</i>

11:51.874 --> 11:53.073
Are <i> you</i> nuts?

11:53.075 --> 11:54.341
Well, clearly
<i>you</i> can't go now.

11:54.343 --> 11:55.542
In case you missed it,

11:55.544 --> 11:56.944
you just got appointed
head honcho.

11:56.946 --> 11:58.812
Big cheese.
<i>Numero uno</i> --

11:58.814 --> 12:00.180
Yeah, I get it.

12:00.182 --> 12:04.284
Whereas I have
a completely different...

12:04.286 --> 12:05.986
you know, skill set.

12:05.988 --> 12:07.621
Are you saying
you're better than me

12:07.623 --> 12:09.122
because you're a werewolf?

12:09.124 --> 12:10.057
I resent that.

12:10.059 --> 12:12.192
Better. Faster. Stronger.

12:12.194 --> 12:13.327
But let's not argue
semantics, Will.

12:13.329 --> 12:14.728
I could fire you now.

12:14.730 --> 12:15.662
How's that for semantics?

12:15.664 --> 12:17.164
Look,

12:17.166 --> 12:18.932
if I can just get in there
and talk to them,

12:18.934 --> 12:20.334
abnormal to abnormal--

12:20.336 --> 12:21.835
Just remember that Worth
is still out there

12:21.837 --> 12:23.003
somewhere.

12:23.005 --> 12:24.805
Yeah, keeps me warm at night.

12:27.275 --> 12:31.078
Okay, um, I've left
the com open on our end, so--

12:31.080 --> 12:32.613
You realize

12:32.615 --> 12:33.847
that if Villanova decides
to launch a strike

12:33.849 --> 12:34.948
against the camp,

12:34.950 --> 12:35.949
you're going to be right
in the thick of it.

12:35.951 --> 12:37.217
Yeah.

12:37.219 --> 12:39.353
So will Kate and Biggie.

12:40.689 --> 12:41.755
Wish me luck.

12:45.126 --> 12:48.228
Have fun storming the castle.

13:03.311 --> 13:05.812
Oh, you guys'll let
anyone in here.

13:08.816 --> 13:11.318
It's nice to see
a friendly face,

13:11.320 --> 13:12.920
even if it is
all beat up.

13:12.922 --> 13:13.854
They hurt you?

13:13.856 --> 13:15.322
No, just pissed me off.

13:17.191 --> 13:18.425
Can you talk to your boyfriend

13:18.427 --> 13:20.060
about getting us
out of these things?

13:20.062 --> 13:21.895
First off,
he's not my boyfriend.

13:21.897 --> 13:22.996
Uh-huh.

13:22.998 --> 13:26.066
Second, he's the one
who did this to me.

13:26.068 --> 13:28.468
Your relationship
could be in trouble.

13:30.438 --> 13:32.072
Thelo's dead,

13:32.074 --> 13:33.340
and without a leader,

13:33.342 --> 13:34.841
this camp is going to
turn into a powder keg.

13:35.877 --> 13:36.977
Yeah...

13:36.979 --> 13:39.379
I've been thinking about
Fallon's murder.

13:39.381 --> 13:41.448
Will didn't kill her.

13:41.450 --> 13:42.482
No, of course not.

13:42.484 --> 13:43.784
And I didn't.

13:45.420 --> 13:46.920
Please.

13:46.922 --> 13:48.455
Well, that only
leaves the Lotus guys

13:48.457 --> 13:50.891
or one of her own men.

13:50.893 --> 13:52.392
Thelo?

13:52.394 --> 13:53.860
But they were
in league together.

13:53.862 --> 13:55.329
Power struggle.

13:55.331 --> 13:57.431
For what?

13:57.433 --> 13:59.866
The Herusans are essentially
prisoners in here.

13:59.868 --> 14:01.935
The only thing the murder
and riot accomplished

14:01.937 --> 14:03.236
was to make
this camp a target.

14:03.238 --> 14:05.372
It sets up the Herusans
as a race to be feared.

14:05.374 --> 14:06.340
That's what I mean.

14:06.342 --> 14:07.407
It is the worst
P.R. move ever.

14:07.409 --> 14:09.009
It just doesn't
make sense.

14:09.011 --> 14:10.978
No, it doesn't.

14:10.980 --> 14:14.281
There's some other agenda
we haven't seen yet.

14:18.953 --> 14:20.354
<i>I haven't got time</i>

14:20.356 --> 14:21.455
<i>for one of your</i>
<i>broken records, son.</i>

14:21.457 --> 14:23.090
One of my team
is on his way into the camp.

14:23.092 --> 14:23.957
Wonderful.

14:23.959 --> 14:25.325
<i>Things are calm now.</i>

14:25.327 --> 14:26.994
<i>We're trying to defuse</i>
<i>the situation from within,</i>

14:26.996 --> 14:29.196
<i>but I want</i>
<i>your personal guarantee</i>

14:29.198 --> 14:31.098
<i>that you will not launch</i>
<i>another strike against the camp.</i>

14:31.100 --> 14:34.167
Fine. Right now, that camp
is the least of my concerns.

14:34.169 --> 14:35.802
It's already under lockdown.

14:35.804 --> 14:37.871
I need to know the situation
at your end, General.

14:37.873 --> 14:39.272
What are you planning to do?

14:39.274 --> 14:40.674
<i>My job.</i>

14:40.676 --> 14:43.310
Which is to murder
thousands of living beings?

14:43.312 --> 14:45.946
<i>You can't really be</i>
<i>as naive as you seem.</i>

14:45.948 --> 14:47.814
Xenocide is not a solution.

14:47.816 --> 14:49.449
What the hell do you think
will happen

14:49.451 --> 14:51.785
if people wake up tomorrow
and find an abnormal army

14:51.787 --> 14:53.420
marching down
their street?

14:53.422 --> 14:54.287
<i>Come on, that won't happen.</i>

14:54.289 --> 14:55.789
Give it 12 more hours, son.

14:55.791 --> 14:59.559
<i>They don't pay me</i>
<i>to roll the dice.</i>

15:01.329 --> 15:04.231
Two years ago,

15:04.233 --> 15:06.333
they sent my son home from Iraq.

15:06.335 --> 15:09.036
<i>Brave soldier.</i>

15:09.038 --> 15:12.406
Made his dad real proud.

15:12.408 --> 15:15.542
What was left of him
would've fit in a shoebox.

15:17.211 --> 15:20.414
<i>I am trying</i>
<i>to save lives.</i>

15:20.416 --> 15:22.549
<i>My grandson's,</i>

15:22.551 --> 15:24.151
<i>and yours.</i>

15:24.153 --> 15:25.252
There has to be
another way.

15:25.254 --> 15:27.554
If I can call
an emergency meeting

15:27.556 --> 15:29.156
with the Sanctuary heads,
then I can--

15:29.158 --> 15:31.224
<i>I have my orders.</i>

15:45.173 --> 15:48.075
Uh, I'm unarmed.

15:48.077 --> 15:50.343
What do you want?

15:50.345 --> 15:52.512
Take me to your leader.

15:52.514 --> 15:54.815
Yes, I just said that.

16:00.988 --> 16:02.422
What's going on?

16:02.424 --> 16:04.324
I'm from
the Sanctuary.

16:04.326 --> 16:05.358
Are you in charge?

16:07.028 --> 16:10.130
Henry Foss.

16:10.132 --> 16:12.232
My name is Garris.
State your business.

16:12.234 --> 16:14.935
I've come to offer a trade.

16:14.937 --> 16:16.536
Send out the Lotus guys,
you keep us instead.

16:16.538 --> 16:17.504
Why should we?

16:17.506 --> 16:18.505
Well, I don't know

16:18.507 --> 16:20.040
if you've been
eavesdropping or not,

16:20.042 --> 16:22.909
but, uh, this ain't exactly
a private party anymore.

16:22.911 --> 16:24.544
This is a trick.

16:24.546 --> 16:26.113
Yeah, not so much.

16:26.115 --> 16:28.448
See, there's
this guy, Villanova,

16:28.450 --> 16:30.217
he's in charge of
all these Lotus dudes,

16:30.219 --> 16:31.351
the ones outside here,

16:31.353 --> 16:32.552
and a bunch more
all over the world.

16:32.554 --> 16:33.920
He's a little worried

16:33.922 --> 16:35.255
about what's going on
at the Calderas.

16:35.257 --> 16:37.958
Our tribes are surfacing.

16:37.960 --> 16:41.495
Yeah, well, one man's tribe
is another man's army.

16:41.497 --> 16:43.029
I'm just sayin',

16:43.031 --> 16:44.431
you let
Villanova's guys go,

16:44.433 --> 16:47.100
it sends a positive message.

16:47.102 --> 16:49.302
Otherwise, I'm afraid things
are gonna get real ugly

16:49.304 --> 16:51.004
real fast.

16:51.006 --> 16:53.173
It's a mistake
to threaten us.

17:00.481 --> 17:02.215
I know what it's like
to be different.

17:02.217 --> 17:03.817
I came here to help.

17:03.819 --> 17:06.619
How do we know you're not
taking orders from Praxis?

17:06.622 --> 17:09.189
Dude, Praxis is gone.

17:10.324 --> 17:12.358
He lies!

17:12.361 --> 17:14.493
Praxis was blown to hell
when the Calderas opened.

17:14.496 --> 17:15.729
Is this true?

17:15.731 --> 17:17.263
There's absolutely
nothing left of Praxis.

17:17.266 --> 17:20.500
But our homes...

17:20.502 --> 17:21.501
Families...

17:21.502 --> 17:23.002
Look, you need
to realize

17:23.005 --> 17:24.471
that the thing that
you're running from

17:24.473 --> 17:25.438
no longer exists.

17:25.440 --> 17:28.441
This, right here
on the surface,

17:28.443 --> 17:31.044
this might be the only chance
that you have left.

17:31.046 --> 17:32.345
Stand down,

17:32.347 --> 17:34.614
show the world
you're not a threat.

17:34.616 --> 17:36.683
Come on, Garris,
what do you say?

17:49.096 --> 17:50.363
No, no, no,
I would like to speak

17:50.365 --> 17:53.300
to the Secretary of Defense
himself.

17:53.302 --> 17:55.302
Will Zimmerman
from the Sanctuary.

17:55.304 --> 17:58.238
Trust me,
he's going to take my call.

17:58.240 --> 18:00.106
Thank you.

18:04.446 --> 18:07.214
Hello?

18:07.216 --> 18:09.516
No, Helen Magnus
is not available, but--

18:10.519 --> 18:12.419
Hello?

18:12.421 --> 18:14.020
Hello...

18:14.022 --> 18:17.324
Dammit!

18:17.326 --> 18:21.528
Come on, will, think, think.

18:29.136 --> 18:31.137
Hey, it's me.

18:31.139 --> 18:33.039
I need your help.

18:43.985 --> 18:46.253
That was a mistake.

18:52.293 --> 18:53.126
Henry...

18:55.496 --> 18:56.529
What did you do to him?

18:58.099 --> 19:00.634
Emotions are
running high.

19:00.636 --> 19:02.068
Praxis is no more,

19:02.070 --> 19:03.403
and we fear
that most of our world

19:03.405 --> 19:05.171
may have also
been destroyed.

19:05.173 --> 19:06.673
What?

19:06.675 --> 19:07.707
Who told you that?

19:07.709 --> 19:09.042
He did.

19:09.044 --> 19:12.045
Why would your people
hide this from us?

19:14.048 --> 19:15.582
I swear, we didn't know.

19:15.584 --> 19:17.384
Garris, I know
it looks like

19:17.386 --> 19:19.619
it's all spiraling
out of control,

19:19.621 --> 19:22.322
but it's not too late
to fix everything.

19:23.524 --> 19:24.491
Yes, it is.

19:40.275 --> 19:42.175
Sir, the situation
at the camp remains stable,

19:42.177 --> 19:43.209
and I've just received word

19:43.211 --> 19:45.412
the moab is in
the drop zone over Chile.

19:45.414 --> 19:46.479
Final security clearance?

19:46.481 --> 19:48.315
Should be
coming in now.

19:48.317 --> 19:50.750
Got it.

19:50.752 --> 19:53.019
Let's do this.

20:25.186 --> 20:26.553
What's wrong?

20:26.555 --> 20:28.054
I don't know.

20:28.056 --> 20:29.422
She's a hyper-empath.

20:29.424 --> 20:30.523
What-what is it?

20:30.525 --> 20:31.524
Our people...

20:31.526 --> 20:33.126
Our people are dying!

20:34.763 --> 20:37.697
Our people are dying!

20:46.806 --> 20:48.140
Where are her people?

20:48.142 --> 20:49.341
They were
the first to surface

20:49.343 --> 20:50.842
at one of
the freedom paths.

20:50.844 --> 20:52.577
She would only
react this way

20:52.579 --> 20:53.879
to great suffering.

20:53.881 --> 20:57.082
Villanova must have
struck a Caldera.

20:59.385 --> 21:00.519
We heard, at the vehicle.

21:00.521 --> 21:01.520
There's been an attack.

21:01.522 --> 21:02.587
Calm yourself.

21:02.589 --> 21:05.057
I will talk to everyone.

21:08.462 --> 21:09.494
We're free?

21:09.496 --> 21:10.896
No,

21:10.898 --> 21:12.130
but you may need
to defend yourselves.

21:12.132 --> 21:13.131
Get her back inside.

21:13.133 --> 21:14.332
No, wait--

21:14.334 --> 21:16.601
Kate, just
get in the tent.

21:20.940 --> 21:22.507
Release your friend.

21:32.752 --> 21:34.386
Report.

21:34.388 --> 21:36.488
Radius of incident,
900 meters.

21:36.490 --> 21:39.091
Casualty estimate?

21:39.093 --> 21:41.093
58%.

21:41.095 --> 21:42.727
Dispatch the predators,

21:42.729 --> 21:44.830
have the squadron liaise
with ground control.

21:44.832 --> 21:46.531
Start mop-up operations.

21:46.533 --> 21:47.999
Yes, sir.

21:58.611 --> 21:59.744
Okay, just a second,
"Hollow Earth"?

21:59.746 --> 22:00.712
Yes.

22:00.714 --> 22:02.914
As in <i> hollow</i> Earth?

22:02.916 --> 22:03.882
That's what I said.

22:03.884 --> 22:05.584
Like under the Earth,
but hollow?

22:05.586 --> 22:06.685
We really need
to move on here.

22:06.687 --> 22:08.453
Why have you never
told me about this?

22:08.455 --> 22:09.488
Of course,
you couldn't.

22:09.490 --> 22:11.857
Wait--
you've been there?

22:11.859 --> 22:13.024
Only once.

22:13.026 --> 22:14.159
Oh, my God, Will!

22:14.161 --> 22:15.193
Abby. Focus.

22:15.195 --> 22:16.194
Okay, well,
it's not like

22:16.196 --> 22:17.229
taking a business trip
to Baltimore.

22:17.231 --> 22:18.997
It's hollow-- focus.

22:20.766 --> 22:23.668
Villanova just dropped
a massive ordnance air burst

22:23.670 --> 22:25.470
on the Chilean Caldera.

22:25.472 --> 22:26.605
Looks like
half the abnormals

22:26.607 --> 22:28.840
are either wounded
or dead.

22:28.842 --> 22:30.842
Ho...Ly...Crap.

22:30.844 --> 22:33.111
Yeah. You can bet
he's gearing up

22:33.113 --> 22:34.913
for one of the other
two Calderas next.

22:34.915 --> 22:36.114
The U.N.?

22:36.116 --> 22:37.716
I'm completely
shut out.

22:37.718 --> 22:40.585
Same thing goes for the other
feds, spooks, and coverts.

22:40.587 --> 22:41.720
Magnus?

22:41.722 --> 22:44.456
Missing in action.

22:44.458 --> 22:45.657
Okay.

22:45.659 --> 22:47.792
Can't Henry
hack his way through?

22:47.794 --> 22:49.794
He's trying to negotiate
from within the camp.

22:51.497 --> 22:53.932
I need access
into Villanova's system.

22:53.934 --> 22:55.167
If I can find out
what he's planning,

22:55.169 --> 22:56.735
then maybe I can
do something to stop him.

22:56.737 --> 22:58.803
So you called me?

22:58.805 --> 23:00.238
I'm no Henry.

23:00.240 --> 23:03.241
I've got "Henrys"
in 17 cities around the world.

23:03.243 --> 23:05.810
Magnus always has
an ace in the hole.

23:05.812 --> 23:06.645
You're mine.

23:06.647 --> 23:08.947
I'm flattered.

23:08.949 --> 23:10.382
I think.

23:10.384 --> 23:12.083
Besides, I don't want you
to use a computer.

23:12.085 --> 23:14.953
Nobody's taking my call
because I'm the enemy now,

23:14.955 --> 23:16.354
but you're one of them.

23:16.356 --> 23:21.059
Not exactly high up
on the food chain, though.

23:21.061 --> 23:23.195
I'm in the basement
office, remember?

23:23.197 --> 23:24.596
The one with no windows

23:24.598 --> 23:25.564
between the coke machine
and the restrooms?

23:25.566 --> 23:26.765
You're FBI.

23:26.767 --> 23:27.933
You know people.

23:27.935 --> 23:30.001
Come on, Ab.

23:30.003 --> 23:31.970
If I can just drive
a wedge in somewhere,

23:31.972 --> 23:33.772
find out what
Villanova's up to...

23:36.142 --> 23:37.609
What? What's that?

23:37.611 --> 23:38.877
Trevor.

23:38.879 --> 23:39.945
Trevor? Who's Trevor?

23:39.947 --> 23:41.546
A friend from South Africa.

23:41.548 --> 23:42.814
Spent some time in the bureau

23:42.816 --> 23:44.249
before transferring to Interpol
out of Paris.

23:44.251 --> 23:45.584
Great. Can you
get ahold of him?

23:45.586 --> 23:47.485
Yeah, I've got
his personal cell number.

23:47.487 --> 23:48.954
Oh?

23:48.956 --> 23:50.622
Well, uh, we dated
for a short time.

23:50.624 --> 23:54.726
Hey, Trev? It's Ab.

23:55.762 --> 23:57.896
Yeah... me too.

23:57.898 --> 24:00.732
Um, I need a favor.

24:02.268 --> 24:03.768
You okay?

24:03.770 --> 24:05.203
Ow. No.

24:05.205 --> 24:07.939
The camp heard about
the first attack.

24:07.941 --> 24:10.075
Oh, man...
How are they taking it?

24:11.345 --> 24:12.978
From the sounds of it,
not great.

24:14.513 --> 24:18.583
First, they cage us
like beasts...

24:18.585 --> 24:22.754
Then, they kill
Fallon and Thelo.

24:22.756 --> 24:25.957
Now, they slaughter
our sister tribes.

24:27.294 --> 24:29.694
We will not be hunted
like animals again!

24:31.697 --> 24:33.698
Hey, hey,
everyone, just calm down!

25:03.095 --> 25:04.262
Enough!

25:07.099 --> 25:09.701
Look at us.

25:09.703 --> 25:11.836
Is it any wonder
they lock us in a cage?

25:11.838 --> 25:14.539
And what of our families

25:14.541 --> 25:15.840
our tribes?

25:15.842 --> 25:17.709
Soon they'll be
under attack again.

25:17.711 --> 25:19.311
And you would dishonor
their bravery

25:19.313 --> 25:20.945
by your cowardice?

25:20.947 --> 25:23.948
How many must die
before we rise up?

25:23.950 --> 25:25.917
How much blood
will quench your anger?

25:25.919 --> 25:27.919
Or yours?

25:27.921 --> 25:30.221
We disgrace the memory
of our fallen

25:30.223 --> 25:32.257
by becoming our enemy.

25:32.259 --> 25:33.158
That's well said,
dude,

25:33.160 --> 25:35.260
but listen,

25:35.262 --> 25:36.695
enough with the bondage, okay?

25:36.697 --> 25:37.929
We need to work together

25:37.931 --> 25:39.264
if we're going to
get through this mess.

25:39.266 --> 25:42.734
You will not be restrained,
but go gently among us.

25:42.736 --> 25:44.302
Herusans are slow to trust.

25:44.304 --> 25:46.905
So I noticed.

25:46.907 --> 25:48.340
They listen to you.

25:48.342 --> 25:50.608
They believe
what you say.

25:50.610 --> 25:52.777
For now.

25:52.779 --> 25:55.246
After Thelo died, I asked you
who was in charge.

25:55.248 --> 25:57.916
You said, "no one."

25:57.918 --> 25:59.017
Maybe you were wrong.

26:03.723 --> 26:07.826
I know, Doug, I can't
believe I forgot my notes.

26:07.828 --> 26:10.061
Yeah, really.

26:10.063 --> 26:12.130
Um, so anyways, right,

26:12.132 --> 26:14.799
I'm speaking at this, uh...

26:16.035 --> 26:18.236
Agency retreat
in Virginia tonight,

26:18.238 --> 26:21.239
and without my data,
I just--

26:21.241 --> 26:23.074
no, no, no,
I just need the pass codes

26:23.076 --> 26:26.378
to the Quantico cloud.

26:26.380 --> 26:28.046
Yeah, I know, I know,
but, come on,

26:28.048 --> 26:31.883
it's me...

26:31.885 --> 26:33.218
Yup.

26:33.220 --> 26:35.086
I'm ready. Shoot.

26:37.823 --> 26:40.992
Okay, you are the best.

26:42.027 --> 26:43.762
Bye.

26:46.966 --> 26:47.966
Is it working?

26:49.869 --> 26:51.636
Uh...Yeah.

26:51.638 --> 26:52.904
Huh...

26:54.140 --> 26:55.340
So, Doug, huh?

26:55.342 --> 26:57.909
Hey, one degree
of separation.

26:57.911 --> 27:01.179
Trevor at Interpol.

27:01.181 --> 27:03.982
Juan--
or <i> Juan</i> at the CIA.

27:03.984 --> 27:04.849
Doug at the NSA...

27:04.851 --> 27:06.217
Mm-hm.

27:06.219 --> 27:08.653
Yeah, it just...

27:08.655 --> 27:09.721
seems like you've dated
a lot of guys.

27:09.723 --> 27:12.157
Okay, that is sexist.

27:12.159 --> 27:14.159
Can't a girl
have male colleagues

27:14.161 --> 27:15.660
who also happen to be
her friends?

27:15.662 --> 27:16.861
Yes, I suppose
they can.

27:16.863 --> 27:19.798
Okay, so...?

27:19.800 --> 27:22.066
Well, thanks to
your multifaceted past,

27:22.068 --> 27:23.768
I've been able to
cobble together intel

27:23.770 --> 27:25.870
from most of the agencies
that Villanova's working with.

27:25.872 --> 27:27.839
This is
a fast-track requisition

27:27.841 --> 27:31.676
for a cluster of cruise missiles
originally headed for Iraq.

27:31.678 --> 27:32.977
Re-routed to
a base in Turkey.

27:32.979 --> 27:34.078
Within easy
striking distance

27:34.080 --> 27:35.046
of the Indonesian Caldera.

27:35.048 --> 27:36.681
His next target.

27:36.683 --> 27:40.385
Not if I can stop him first.

27:45.357 --> 27:46.791
Hey...

27:47.893 --> 27:49.327
What've you been up to?

27:49.329 --> 27:51.296
Taking a look around.

27:51.298 --> 27:54.265
Checking on supplies.

27:57.169 --> 27:59.370
I went to
Fallon's tent.

27:59.372 --> 28:01.272
Because...

28:01.274 --> 28:03.975
To have a look at
the body, but it's gone.

28:03.977 --> 28:06.110
Well, they probably
took it away.

28:06.112 --> 28:07.946
Fallon was
a tribal leader.

28:07.948 --> 28:09.147
Sign of respect.

28:09.149 --> 28:11.950
No body
anywhere, Kate.

28:11.952 --> 28:13.751
As in...

28:13.753 --> 28:16.120
Infirmary,
supply tent, trucks.

28:16.122 --> 28:17.889
No body.

28:17.891 --> 28:20.024
But I did find this.

28:20.026 --> 28:21.326
The murder weapon?

28:21.328 --> 28:22.827
Looks like.

28:22.829 --> 28:24.128
Where?

28:24.130 --> 28:26.464
Your boyfriend's tent.

28:34.407 --> 28:35.507
See this?

28:35.509 --> 28:37.008
The words
"maintenance facility"

28:37.010 --> 28:38.476
keep popping up.

28:38.478 --> 28:40.278
Is that Halliburton-speak
for something?

28:40.280 --> 28:41.813
Beats me.

28:41.815 --> 28:43.081
Damn it, every time
I try to access.

28:43.083 --> 28:44.182
See, look at this.

28:44.184 --> 28:46.084
Even the backups?

28:46.086 --> 28:47.819
Backups?
What backups?

28:47.821 --> 28:49.888
Every document pertaining
to Lotus' strategic plans,

28:49.890 --> 28:51.256
no matter how top secret,
is backed up.

28:51.258 --> 28:54.225
In fact, even the backups
have backups.

28:54.227 --> 28:57.161
But seeing as we've
already snuck into

28:57.163 --> 29:01.966
a tiny, wee corner
of the cloud, I wonder ...

29:07.473 --> 29:09.274
Gotcha.

29:09.276 --> 29:11.476
This is feed from
the Wyoming server farm.

29:12.946 --> 29:14.145
You are brilliant.

29:14.147 --> 29:15.780
Yes, I am.

29:15.782 --> 29:17.482
"Quarantine protocols."

29:17.484 --> 29:18.816
"Psychological profiling."

29:18.818 --> 29:20.985
"Subject experimentation?"

29:20.987 --> 29:22.554
There is no way
the U.N. would sanction

29:22.556 --> 29:23.555
something like this.

29:23.557 --> 29:25.423
Sure they would.

29:25.425 --> 29:26.858
They're panicked
just like everybody else,

29:26.860 --> 29:28.126
and they just want
the problem to go away.

29:28.128 --> 29:28.993
Look at this stuff.

29:28.995 --> 29:31.095
"Genetic manipulation."

29:31.097 --> 29:32.530
"Hybrid trials."

29:32.532 --> 29:33.631
"Medical testing..."

29:33.633 --> 29:34.966
Oh, my God,
they can't be serious.

29:34.968 --> 29:36.534
You want to bet?

29:36.536 --> 29:40.238
We're looking at the blueprint
for the abnormal final solution.

29:41.874 --> 29:43.508
The abnormals
that are taken alive

29:43.510 --> 29:45.410
will end up being
government Guinea pigs.

29:45.412 --> 29:46.711
Think about it,

29:46.713 --> 29:47.779
who wouldn't want
an army of Basilisks?

29:47.781 --> 29:50.181
And what better spy
than an empath?

29:50.183 --> 29:52.216
But why stop with the
Hollow Earth Abnormals?

29:52.218 --> 29:54.485
Especially when there are
sanctuaries worldwide

29:54.487 --> 29:57.522
just ripe
for the picking.

29:59.358 --> 30:01.125
This won't end here.

30:07.032 --> 30:08.499
This is Magnus's
worst nightmare.

30:13.917 --> 30:16.812
You see?
They grow nervous again.

30:16.813 --> 30:18.079
Well,
I don't blame them.

30:18.081 --> 30:20.127
They have no idea where
the next attack will hit.

30:20.128 --> 30:22.362
They fear
for their people,

30:22.364 --> 30:25.198
for their families
out there in the war zone,

30:25.200 --> 30:28.001
and if that fear should
turn to violence again...

30:28.003 --> 30:29.536
Why don't you try
talking to them?

30:29.538 --> 30:30.971
It worked
the first time.

30:30.973 --> 30:32.305
They don't want
platitudes.

30:32.307 --> 30:34.908
They want information.

30:34.910 --> 30:37.477
Ah, now, that...
I can provide.

30:46.854 --> 30:49.356
<i>Nobody wants a war.</i>
<i>Certainly not us.</i>

30:49.358 --> 30:50.957
And yet, many of us
have been attacked,

30:50.959 --> 30:52.292
killed.

30:52.294 --> 30:53.960
<i>An action taken out of</i>
<i>ignorance and fear.</i>

30:53.962 --> 30:55.962
<i>And you do nothing</i>
<i>to stop it.</i>

30:55.964 --> 30:57.163
Believe me,
I'm working on it,

30:57.165 --> 30:58.031
but I need time.

30:59.634 --> 31:01.434
<i>I believe you,</i>

31:01.436 --> 31:03.236
<i>but my people--</i>

31:03.238 --> 31:05.338
all I ask is that you try,
for their sake.

31:06.941 --> 31:10.010
<i>I will speak</i>
<i>to them again.</i>

31:10.012 --> 31:12.279
Henry, we're trying
to get to Lillian Lee.

31:12.281 --> 31:14.247
Wait, who's "we"?
Did Magnus--

31:14.249 --> 31:16.483
<i>No. I got Abby here</i>
<i>working her contacts.</i>

31:16.485 --> 31:18.985
<i>Maybe if we can put</i>
<i>enough external pressure</i>

31:18.987 --> 31:20.620
<i>on the U.N...</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

31:20.622 --> 31:21.955
<i>It's all I got left.</i>

31:21.957 --> 31:23.056
All right, what can I do?

31:23.058 --> 31:24.491
Intel puts
the Indonesian Caldera

31:24.493 --> 31:25.492
in the crosshairs next.

31:25.494 --> 31:27.327
<i>No...</i>

31:27.329 --> 31:28.528
<i>Can you buy us some time?</i>

31:30.898 --> 31:33.300
Oh, man...

31:33.302 --> 31:35.702
I might be able to uplink
a scrambler signal

31:35.704 --> 31:37.103
<i>to whatever satellite</i>

31:37.105 --> 31:38.438
<i>Villanova's using</i>
<i>to ping off of.</i>

31:38.440 --> 31:39.506
<i>That'll blind his birds</i>
<i>for a while.</i>

31:39.508 --> 31:40.573
<i>That's just a bandaid,</i>
<i>though, Will.</i>

31:40.575 --> 31:41.508
Whatever you said,
I'll take it.

31:41.510 --> 31:42.509
And soon, yeah?

31:42.511 --> 31:44.577
<i>Yeah, I'm on it.</i>

31:44.579 --> 31:46.413
Good luck, Garris.

32:20.214 --> 32:22.449
What news do you bring?

32:22.451 --> 32:24.651
The tribes are under attack.

32:24.653 --> 32:26.019
One freedom path

32:26.021 --> 32:27.487
has already
been destroyed.

32:27.489 --> 32:28.655
The mountain path?

32:30.091 --> 32:31.725
The desert.

32:34.395 --> 32:36.329
Not the worst scenario.

32:38.099 --> 32:39.499
But the other paths
remain targets.

32:39.501 --> 32:41.301
Mmm.

32:41.303 --> 32:43.036
Are you not saddened

32:43.038 --> 32:44.537
by the death of our people?

32:44.539 --> 32:47.007
We knew this would be
a time for heroes.

32:47.009 --> 32:48.241
And martyrs.

32:49.744 --> 32:51.244
You send them
to their deaths,

32:51.246 --> 32:52.145
and for what?

32:52.147 --> 32:54.414
Praxis is no more.

32:56.617 --> 32:58.718
You knew this would happen.

33:00.756 --> 33:03.356
Adam Worth is a madman.

33:03.358 --> 33:06.393
I knew that
when we allied with him,

33:06.395 --> 33:08.428
but it is his genius

33:08.430 --> 33:10.030
that has allowed
our plan to succeed.

33:10.032 --> 33:12.632
The power generated
by destroying Praxis

33:12.634 --> 33:14.401
blew open the freedom paths.

33:14.403 --> 33:16.603
You promised a new age.

33:16.605 --> 33:19.706
If I had known
it would look like this...

33:21.776 --> 33:22.809
What have I done?

33:24.078 --> 33:25.412
You have freed our people.

33:25.414 --> 33:27.414
We are not free.

33:27.416 --> 33:28.248
We are slaughtered.

33:28.250 --> 33:29.449
We are reviled.

33:29.451 --> 33:31.418
Be patient.

33:31.420 --> 33:35.121
Greater things await us here
on the surface.

33:35.123 --> 33:36.756
Interesting.

33:36.758 --> 33:38.324
You mind telling us
what you mean by that?

33:40.227 --> 33:41.061
You betray your own?

33:41.063 --> 33:43.363
No. You do.

33:49.304 --> 33:51.471
Oh, and the bitch is back.

33:51.473 --> 33:53.573
Tell us.

33:53.575 --> 33:55.575
What is your master plan?

33:55.577 --> 33:56.443
'Cause taking hostages,

33:56.445 --> 33:58.311
pissing off the U.N.,

33:58.313 --> 34:00.747
and sending your people
through the Calderas to die

34:00.749 --> 34:01.748
just doesn't seem like

34:01.750 --> 34:03.483
the best
strategy around.

34:03.485 --> 34:04.617
You will learn
nothing from me.

34:05.719 --> 34:07.120
You want to bet?

34:32.213 --> 34:34.080
How long till
the MC-130's in range?

34:34.081 --> 34:36.683
We are 50 seconds
away from target zone.

34:36.685 --> 34:38.051
Stand by for launch.

34:38.053 --> 34:39.085
Standing by.

34:39.087 --> 34:41.087
Okay...

34:42.357 --> 34:44.591
Ah, that's my girl.

34:53.266 --> 34:55.568
Beautiful.

34:58.405 --> 34:59.272
What the hell?

34:59.274 --> 35:00.273
Lieutenant!

35:01.443 --> 35:02.809
I'm getting a report.

35:02.811 --> 35:06.379
Pilots have lost
satellite navigation.

35:06.381 --> 35:07.347
Switching to manual.

35:07.349 --> 35:08.681
Can we still launch?

35:08.683 --> 35:09.716
Negative. The failsafe codes

35:09.718 --> 35:11.050
are routed
through the NSA birds,

35:11.052 --> 35:12.218
and those just went blind.

35:12.220 --> 35:13.353
Then re-route!

35:13.355 --> 35:16.723
Get me a satellite
that works, dammit.

35:16.725 --> 35:18.291
<i> So you know</i>
<i>it's only a matter of time</i>

35:18.293 --> 35:19.325
before Villanova switches
to another satellite.

35:19.327 --> 35:21.294
Can you stay
one step ahead of him?

35:21.296 --> 35:23.196
I'd say we bought
ourselves 15 minutes, tops.

35:23.198 --> 35:24.797
Less if they're
on the ball.

35:24.799 --> 35:26.399
<i>How do we stop</i>
<i>the second attack that fast?</i>

35:28.803 --> 35:30.236
Whoa.

35:30.238 --> 35:31.571
Dude, this is weird.

35:31.573 --> 35:32.805
<i>What?</i>

35:32.807 --> 35:36.209
Yeah, there it is again.

35:36.211 --> 35:37.410
<i>What?</i>

35:37.412 --> 35:38.611
<i>Somebody's eavesdropping.</i>

35:38.613 --> 35:39.445
On us?

35:39.447 --> 35:41.014
<i>Digitally speaking.</i>

35:41.016 --> 35:42.115
<i>It's like I got</i>
<i>a piggyback on my hack.</i>

35:42.117 --> 35:43.716
Who is it?

35:43.718 --> 35:45.585
Hang on, just
running a trace.

35:48.455 --> 35:50.723
<i>Uh...</i>

35:50.725 --> 35:51.658
<i>It's you.</i>

35:51.660 --> 35:53.226
<i>Me?</i>

35:53.228 --> 35:54.594
But it can't be you.
You don't know how.

35:54.596 --> 35:56.062
<i>No offense.</i>

35:56.064 --> 35:57.697
Are you saying that
the breach is coming from

35:57.699 --> 35:58.965
inside the Sanctuary?

35:58.967 --> 36:00.867
Dude, grab a transponder
off my bench.

36:04.471 --> 36:06.172
What if Villanova
sent in some of his goons

36:06.174 --> 36:07.507
to try and shut us down?

36:07.509 --> 36:10.109
The thought did occur to me.

36:29.664 --> 36:31.731
What's it take

36:31.733 --> 36:33.566
to get a decent cup of tea
around here?

36:41.832 --> 36:43.565
-Where have you been?
-How did you get back?

36:43.567 --> 36:44.766
You know we thought
you were gone, or--

36:44.768 --> 36:46.101
Dead?

36:46.103 --> 36:47.336
Yes, of course you did,

36:47.338 --> 36:48.937
otherwise you would've
kept looking for me.

36:48.939 --> 36:51.240
Look, I know you have questions,
and I will explain,

36:51.242 --> 36:53.041
but we don't have time
right now.

36:53.043 --> 36:54.743
Another attack
on the Calderas is imminent.

36:54.745 --> 36:56.745
Yeah, tell me about it.
My hands are tied here.

36:56.747 --> 36:58.680
Well, I've been monitoring
the abnormal activity

36:58.682 --> 36:59.882
at the sites,

36:59.884 --> 37:00.749
and I've noticed
something interesting.

37:02.118 --> 37:05.287
This is footage from
before the first strike.

37:05.289 --> 37:07.756
Look at their movements.
Notice anything?

37:08.892 --> 37:10.225
What are you seeing?

37:10.227 --> 37:11.193
Watch.

37:11.195 --> 37:12.594
If we adjust the images

37:12.596 --> 37:14.296
to compensate for
the angle of viewing,

37:14.298 --> 37:16.031
in other words,
turn all the cameras

37:16.033 --> 37:18.967
so they're pointing
true north...

37:18.969 --> 37:20.836
The abnormals
are moving in formation.

37:20.838 --> 37:22.704
The exact same formation,

37:22.706 --> 37:23.739
moving at the same time.

37:23.741 --> 37:25.807
In perfect sync.

37:25.809 --> 37:27.576
This flank turns left
at the same time as the others,

37:27.578 --> 37:28.577
and so on and so on.

37:28.579 --> 37:30.979
How is that possible?

37:30.981 --> 37:32.748
Well, obviously
they're being directed.

37:32.750 --> 37:34.182
Yes, but how?

37:34.184 --> 37:35.450
I've been scanning all
the frequencies in the area.

37:35.452 --> 37:37.786
There's no radio transmissions
in or out.

37:37.788 --> 37:40.122
And yet someone, or something,

37:40.124 --> 37:42.090
is in complete control
of these beings.

37:42.092 --> 37:44.927
Psychically.

37:44.929 --> 37:46.061
What about Worth?

37:46.063 --> 37:48.163
He died
long before this happened.

37:50.600 --> 37:52.367
Then who?

37:55.872 --> 37:59.007
<i>Dr. Zimmerman,</i>
<i>I do not appreciate--</i>

37:59.009 --> 38:00.609
<i>Dr. Magnus.</i>

38:00.611 --> 38:01.877
Lillian.

38:01.879 --> 38:03.545
<i>So that explains</i>

38:03.547 --> 38:05.180
<i>why I've been getting bombarded</i>
<i>with subcommittee inquiries,</i>

38:05.182 --> 38:06.682
<i>foreign oversight regulators,</i>

38:06.684 --> 38:08.016
<i>the Russian President--</i>

38:08.018 --> 38:10.686
Actually, the credit for
all of that goes to Will.

38:10.688 --> 38:12.287
Uh, with a little help.

38:12.289 --> 38:13.322
<i>And you are?</i>

38:13.324 --> 38:15.157
Abby Corrigan, FBI.

38:15.159 --> 38:17.025
<i>I don't know the name.</i>

38:17.027 --> 38:20.829
Well, now you do.

38:20.831 --> 38:24.066
Dr. Lee, please listen
very carefully

38:24.068 --> 38:25.901
to what Will's
about to tell you.

38:28.304 --> 38:31.106
Villanova's next target

38:31.108 --> 38:32.841
is the Indonesian
Caldera.

38:32.843 --> 38:33.775
<i>I already know that.</i>

38:33.777 --> 38:34.876
Yes,

38:34.878 --> 38:36.144
but what you and he
both don't know

38:36.146 --> 38:36.979
is that five miles
below the surface

38:36.981 --> 38:38.747
is a Basilisk feeding ground.

38:38.749 --> 38:40.782
You drop a cruise cluster
into that Caldera,

38:40.784 --> 38:42.217
it'll create
a chain reaction,

38:42.219 --> 38:44.853
rip right through Hollow Earth's
geothermal system.

38:44.855 --> 38:46.989
We're talking a massive
seismic reaction

38:46.991 --> 38:48.323
on a global level.

38:48.325 --> 38:49.624
Such a cataclysm

38:49.626 --> 38:51.259
would give the abnormal armies
the foothold they need

38:51.261 --> 38:53.028
to conquer the surface.

38:53.030 --> 38:54.162
<i>Why didn't you</i>
<i>tell me this earlier?</i>

38:54.164 --> 38:55.630
Because we only
learned about this ourselves

38:55.632 --> 38:56.765
minutes ago

38:56.767 --> 38:59.134
when we discovered Fallon alive
at the camp.

38:59.136 --> 39:01.870
You and Villanova
are being played.

39:01.872 --> 39:04.039
Please, give us control
of the situation.

39:04.041 --> 39:05.307
We will work with the abnormals,

39:05.309 --> 39:06.241
help them transition

39:06.243 --> 39:07.743
to a provisional
government

39:07.745 --> 39:08.844
to ensure peace,

39:08.846 --> 39:10.078
but we've got to do it
right now,

39:10.080 --> 39:11.813
otherwise Villanova's
gonna pull the trigger.

39:13.349 --> 39:16.284
<i>I'll tell the General</i>
<i>to stand down immediately.</i>

39:17.820 --> 39:19.454
Thank you.

39:19.456 --> 39:21.957
<i>And then we're all going</i>
<i>to have a very long talk.</i>

39:21.959 --> 39:22.891
Hmm.

39:24.293 --> 39:25.827
Ah.

39:29.032 --> 39:31.033
Well done, you.

39:31.035 --> 39:31.900
And you.

39:33.069 --> 39:34.369
We do make a good team.

39:35.938 --> 39:37.939
Yes. Yes, we do.

39:37.941 --> 39:41.109
You, me, and, uh,
all your friends.

39:45.181 --> 39:47.282
It's good to be home.

40:06.302 --> 40:11.740
She'll be dealt with
by a tribunal of her peers.

40:11.742 --> 40:13.742
So you're going
back under?

40:13.744 --> 40:16.778
This is not our home.

40:16.780 --> 40:18.680
But your home
may be lost.

40:18.682 --> 40:20.182
Then we will
build another,

40:20.184 --> 40:24.352
of our own making,
with our own government.

40:25.955 --> 40:28.123
Please believe me
when I say

40:28.125 --> 40:30.959
I only wanted the best
for our people,

40:30.961 --> 40:32.094
for all our people.

40:32.096 --> 40:34.996
I know.

40:34.998 --> 40:37.799
Your heart was
in the right place.

40:37.801 --> 40:39.634
Actually...

40:39.636 --> 40:42.070
It's here.

40:42.072 --> 40:44.005
And I have two.

40:46.176 --> 40:47.209
Kate, I really don't
know how to--

40:47.211 --> 40:48.877
I'm coming with you.

40:49.912 --> 40:51.913
Straight from the boss.

40:51.915 --> 40:53.448
Magnus says you're right,

40:53.450 --> 40:56.184
that Fallon is just the tip
of a way larger iceberg,

40:56.186 --> 40:57.786
and there are loads more
bad guys down there

40:57.788 --> 40:58.887
that we need to deal with.

40:58.889 --> 41:01.056
Are you certain?

41:01.058 --> 41:02.691
It won't be easy for you.

41:02.693 --> 41:06.795
Well, the rest of the team
can handle things topside.

41:06.797 --> 41:08.763
I'm on Hollow Earth detail.

41:17.140 --> 41:18.707
It looks like Garris

41:18.709 --> 41:19.808
has managed to convince
most of the abnormals

41:19.810 --> 41:20.976
to return underground.

41:20.978 --> 41:22.043
Most?

41:22.045 --> 41:23.245
I know,
it sounds like spin.

41:23.247 --> 41:24.379
Well, we both know

41:24.381 --> 41:25.914
not all of them
will go back.

41:25.916 --> 41:27.149
The most fanatical ones
would rather die

41:27.151 --> 41:28.950
than return
to Hollow Earth.

41:28.952 --> 41:32.020
An abnormal insurgency,
that's great news.

41:32.022 --> 41:33.288
We can handle it.

41:33.290 --> 41:34.923
Besides, it could have
been much worse.

41:34.925 --> 41:36.358
You know, you really did

41:36.360 --> 41:37.759
a very fine job
in my absence.

41:37.761 --> 41:39.027
Perhaps you'd like

41:39.029 --> 41:40.228
to continue
as Sanctuary head?

41:40.230 --> 41:42.063
No.
No, no, thank you.

41:42.065 --> 41:43.798
Maybe some day,
but not now,

41:43.800 --> 41:45.467
and by the way, you can stop
avoiding the question

41:45.469 --> 41:47.235
at any time.

41:47.237 --> 41:48.236
What question?

41:48.238 --> 41:50.872
What the hell happened to you?

41:50.874 --> 41:52.941
How did you get back
from Hollow Earth?

41:52.943 --> 41:53.842
Druitt didn't bring you,

41:53.844 --> 41:54.943
and how did you
escape the blast

41:54.945 --> 41:56.444
that took out Praxis?

41:56.446 --> 41:57.412
You know, that's more
than one question.

41:57.414 --> 41:58.880
Magnus...

41:58.882 --> 42:01.683
You were out of communication
for hours.

42:01.685 --> 42:05.720
More like... years, actually.

42:06.889 --> 42:07.756
Years?

42:07.758 --> 42:11.359
113, to be precise.

42:12.863 --> 42:14.329
I need to be sitting down
for this, don't I?

42:14.331 --> 42:15.330
Mmm,

42:15.332 --> 42:18.133
with a-a '56 Bordeaux,
I should think.

42:21.103 --> 42:22.771
Shall we?

42:26.409 --> 42:28.843
Don't tell me.
It's a long story.

42:28.845 --> 42:32.113
Ah, you have no idea.
