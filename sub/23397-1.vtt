Okay, let's say there are
100 people in this car.

16 personality types,

18:31.784 --> 18:33.381

- What kind of person are you?

18:58.217 --> 18:59.718
It's just a simple
hypothetical question.

19:01.051 --> 19:02.818
Okay.

19:06.983 --> 19:11.683
What if I asked you
to do one little thing?

19:13.950 --> 19:18.015
It's something that you are
uniquely qualified to do.

19:18.017 --> 19:20.848
It's something
that's meaningless to you,

19:20.850 --> 19:24.318

an individual on this train.

19:25.683 --> 19:26.814

what kind of thing.

- Mmm-hmm. Does it matter?
- Well, I think it does.

19:31.850 --> 19:32.947

19:32.949 --> 19:34.214
the consequences
of what you did.

19:34.216 --> 19:36.084
Then why would I do it?

19:38.984 --> 19:40.951
Because there
would be a reward.

19:42.083 --> 19:43.150
A-ha.

- a hypothetical question.
- TONY: Uh-huh.

56:35.148 --> 56:36.779
What was the question?

56:36.781 --> 56:39.680
What if someone asked you
to do one little thing,

56:39.682 --> 56:41.178
something that's
meaningless to you,

56:41.180 --> 56:43.812
but would affect another
passenger on this train?

56:43.814 --> 56:46.780
Would you do it?

56:46.782 --> 56:48.278
I don't know.
What's in it for me?

56:48.280 --> 56:50.680
$100,000.

56:50.682 --> 56:51.679
Absolutely.

56:51.681 --> 56:53.046
MICHAEL: You don't
even know what it is.

56:53.048 --> 56:55.146
It doesn't matter. Come on.

56:55.148 --> 56:58.346
So what is
that one little thing?

56:58.348 --> 57:00.780
A passenger on this train
doesn't belong.

57:00.782 --> 57:01.946
They're carrying a bag,

57:01.948 --> 57:03.212
but you don't know
what it looks like.

57:03.214 --> 57:04.912
All you have to do

57:04.914 --> 57:07.311
is find them
before they get off.

57:07.313 --> 57:10.145
That's it?
It's not much to go on, Mike.

57:10.147 --> 57:11.211
Tell me about it.

57:11.213 --> 57:13.445
What happens
when you find 'em?

57:13.447 --> 57:16.083
They die. Hypothetically.

57:17.082 --> 57:19.345
So what would you do, Mike?

57:19.347 --> 57:22.211
I'd get all the people
left on the train in one car,

57:22.213 --> 57:24.746
propose that very scenario.

57:24.748 --> 57:25.946
TONY: No, no, no, no.

57:25.948 --> 57:27.214
I mean, would you
take the money?

57:30.414 --> 57:34.948
You know what? I already did.

57:37.347 --> 57:41.178
- You see, I count five.
- Five what?

57:41.180 --> 57:43.413
Five people left
that don't belong.

57:43.415 --> 57:45.946
Five people on this train
that I've never seen before.

57:45.948 --> 57:46.981
The lady right here.

57:48.948 --> 57:51.945
The young girl with the
pink hair at the window.

57:51.947 --> 57:54.012
Mr. Goldman Sachs over there.

57:54.014 --> 57:56.314

57:59.214 --> 58:00.215
And you.

58:04.881 --> 58:06.115

58:10.415 --> 58:12.812
- You know what I would do?
- Tell me.

58:12.814 --> 58:15.013
I would pocket that 100 grand,

58:15.015 --> 58:17.145
find the guy,

58:17.147 --> 58:18.882
tell him to
take a different train.

58:20.148 --> 58:21.649

58:22.414 --> 58:23.948

58:29.081 --> 58:31.349

58:37.682 --> 58:39.913
So, you never
answered the question.

58:39.915 --> 58:40.945
What question?

58:40.947 --> 58:42.345
What are you doing
on this train?

58:42.347 --> 58:44.680
JACKSON:
Maybe I'm like you.

58:44.682 --> 58:46.278
Maybe I wanna
see the end of the line.

58:46.280 --> 58:48.081
Wait a minute. Excuse me.

58:49.048 --> 58:50.946
JACKSON: I call.

58:50.948 --> 58:53.816
This is a monthly pass.
You're a regular commuter.

58:54.882 --> 58:57.949
Yeah. And I have a full house.

58:58.681 --> 59:00.211
Oh!

59:00.213 --> 59:02.615
- What do you have?
- That's it for me.

59:03.781 --> 59:05.281
I'm sorry.

59:15.948 --> 59:18.749
So what if I'm this guy
you're talking about?

59:19.681 --> 59:21.813
- Are you?
- If I was?

59:21.815 --> 59:24.011
Someone wants you dead.

59:24.013 --> 59:26.680
I can help you, but I need
to know what you know,

59:26.682 --> 59:28.212
why you're going
to Cold Spring,

59:28.214 --> 59:30.011
what's in that case.

59:30.013 --> 59:33.011
- It's just a guitar.
- Open it.

59:33.013 --> 59:35.145
You wanna help me?
Why should I trust you?

59:35.147 --> 59:36.215
Open the case.

59:54.081 --> 59:55.745
So what do we do now?

59:55.747 --> 59:59.312
You and I go to carriage one,
barricade ourselves inside.

59:59.314 --> 01:00:00.912
And then, what,
you gonna find this killer,

01:00:00.914 --> 01:00:02.046
take him down yourself?

01:00:02.048 --> 01:00:03.315
Gonna try.

01:00:04.448 --> 01:00:06.948
Obviously, I'm not Prynne.

01:00:09.881 --> 01:00:12.212
But you seem to have
figured that out already.

01:00:12.214 --> 01:00:13.680
That's a left-handed guitar.

01:00:13.682 --> 01:00:15.315
What's that got to do with it?

01:00:16.782 --> 01:00:18.682
Hey, man, are you okay?

01:00:21.882 --> 01:00:22.945
Yeah.

(LAUGHING) Well, shit.

01:00:27.148 --> 01:00:29.082

she chose you.

Which one is it?

01:00:34.148 --> 01:00:36.079

All you got to lose
and you don't know.

01:00:39.815 --> 01:00:41.279
You killed that agent.

01:00:41.281 --> 01:00:43.278
No, that's on you, man.

01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:45.911
How much is she paying you
to kill the witness?

01:00:45.913 --> 01:00:47.780
Same as you, I guess.

01:00:47.782 --> 01:00:50.079
But that's not really
how it works out, is it?

01:00:50.081 --> 01:00:53.082
No matter how much they pay,
you always end up owing more.

01:00:55.013 --> 01:00:58.081

Tell me what you saw.

01:34:23.945 --> 01:34:25.811

Watch your step.

01:34:31.712 --> 01:34:33.044
So this is
the end of the line.

01:34:33.046 --> 01:34:34.678
I guess so.

JACKSON: Next time
I'm taking the bus.

01:34:37.780 --> 01:34:40.410
All I know is this, all right?
That guy is a goddamn hero.

01:34:40.412 --> 01:34:42.942
- Okay? A hero. Write that down.
- DENYS: Yeah.

A hero. Did you write it?

01:34:54.446 --> 01:34:56.678
So, what's up?
You got a boyfriend or what?

(LAUGHS) What?

01:34:59.079 --> 01:35:01.244
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Is it serious?

I wanna know what I'm dealing
with, you know what I mean?

How you doing?

I believe
you may have lost this.

I've been looking
for this all day.

- Shall we get you home?
- Yeah, let's go home.

01:35:24.945 --> 01:35:26.711
So, this is
what you do every day

Is it really true about Murph?

We're checking CCTV

01:36:03.878 --> 01:36:05.677

Read that one
a few years back.

It's got a hell of an ending.

The 6:20 every morning
to Chicago. The 5:30 home.

You know, I never took you
for a commuter.

the people you work for,

Alex Murphy goes down,
you win.

That 16-year-old girl
dies on that train, you win.

You do your job, disappear,

just collateral damage.

You didn't pick me because
the witness was on my train.

Suddenly I have motive,
opportunity,

01:38:06.278 --> 01:38:08.277
just like Alex Murphy.

01:38:08.279 --> 01:38:12.080
This wasn't his operation.
You played us both.

is gonna happen here, Michael.
