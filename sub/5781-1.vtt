17:42.895 --> 17:44.643
We could bring them
some food.

17:44.763 --> 17:46.812
I'm sure that Mark
and his family

17:46.932 --> 17:48.781
have enough food, honey.

17:48.901 --> 17:51.784
Not my salad, though.

17:51.904 --> 17:53.619
Salad-
she's obsessed.

17:53.739 --> 17:55.621
Uh...

17:55.741 --> 17:57.289
I don't know.
Maybe.

17:57.409 --> 17:59.959
You want to do a little
get-together?

18:00.079 --> 18:01.126
Let the kids play.

18:01.246 --> 18:03.062
We could get to know each other,
maybe dressed?

18:03.182 --> 18:04.096
We'll see.
We'll see.

18:04.216 --> 18:07.132
No.
Okay, good.

18:07.252 --> 18:08.600
Come on, honey,
another time.

18:08.720 --> 18:10.769
Baby, come on,
come on.

18:10.889 --> 18:11.971
Good to meet you, Mark.
Honey?

18:12.091 --> 18:13.639
Good to-
hey, hey, hey, come here.

18:13.759 --> 18:15.007
No, Harris, back inside.

18:15.127 --> 18:16.408
Come on.
Can you take him up?

18:16.528 --> 18:17.443
Yeah.

18:17.563 --> 18:18.477
Thank you.

18:18.597 --> 18:19.511
See ya.

18:19.631 --> 18:21.213
All right, yeah,
go upstairs.

18:21.333 --> 18:22.381
Oh, wait.

18:22.501 --> 18:24.383
Now, just hold on a second.

18:24.503 --> 18:26.185
I'm sorry about that.

18:26.305 --> 18:27.853
I didn't mean to be-
I mean-

18:27.973 --> 18:29.521
No, no, no.
We don't want to-

18:29.641 --> 18:31.123
What time did you want
to come over?

18:31.243 --> 18:32.458
No, no,
don't worry about it.

18:32.578 --> 18:33.959
She's just-
she gets a thing in her-

18:34.079 --> 18:36.695
This afternoon.
Does that work for you?

18:36.815 --> 18:37.863
We're free.

18:37.983 --> 18:39.365
Would you like to
this afternoon?

18:39.485 --> 18:40.532
Let's do this afternoon.

18:40.652 --> 18:41.900
Mark.
- Very nice to meet you.

18:42.020 --> 18:44.136
I'll bring you
something healthy.

18:44.256 --> 18:45.304
Good.
- Something healthy.

18:45.424 --> 18:47.139
But don't you put yourself out,
now, okay?

18:47.259 --> 18:48.240
. Okay"

18:48.360 --> 18:49.441
All right, Mark.
- Thank you, Bob.

18:49.561 --> 18:50.609
Great to meet you,
you know?

18:50.729 --> 18:51.643
Nice to meet you.

18:51.763 --> 18:52.811
Good to meet
the neighbors.

18:52.931 --> 18:54.146
Enjoy the wood.
- Thank you.

18:54.266 --> 18:57.983
Get a nice little fire going
there, huh?

18:58.103 --> 18:59.651
It's so nice.

18:59.771 --> 19:01.771
Oh, it's beautiful.

19:03.642 --> 19:05.090
" No!

19:05.210 --> 19:08.214
[laughs]

19:09.548 --> 19:12.097
You have to stop.

19:12.217 --> 19:14.217
Bye.

19:15.954 --> 19:17.954
Who was that?

19:19.057 --> 19:20.105
It was the neighbors.

19:20.225 --> 19:21.173
Who was on the phone?

19:21.293 --> 19:23.675
Oh, my sister.

19:23.795 --> 19:27.679
She's back
on the east coast.

19:27.799 --> 19:28.847
How is she?

19:28.967 --> 19:31.350
Oh, same old.

19:31.470 --> 19:33.470
She says hello.

19:35.541 --> 19:37.541
Hello.

19:39.444 --> 19:41.444
What neighbor?

19:43.549 --> 19:45.597
The, uh...
the neighbors.

19:45.717 --> 19:47.599
The Sakowskis.

19:47.719 --> 19:49.701
Who?

19:49.821 --> 19:51.994
The Sakowskis.

19:53.559 --> 19:57.109
Well, what was so important
they had to wake us up?

19:57.229 --> 19:58.477
They brought us
some firewood

19:58.597 --> 20:00.345
and wanted to come over
for lunch or something,

20:00.465 --> 20:03.082
bring food and meet us.

20:03.202 --> 20:07.753
And you already said
that was fine, didn't you?

20:07.873 --> 20:08.787
Huh?

20:08.907 --> 20:12.291
<i>' [sighs]</i>

20:12.411 --> 20:13.559
Mark.

20:13.679 --> 20:15.327
Give me a break.
What was I supposed to say?

20:15.447 --> 20:16.361
"I can't,
we're busy,"

20:16.481 --> 20:17.863
then they see we're not?

20:17.983 --> 20:19.198
No, you tell them-

20:19.318 --> 20:20.265
[scoffs]

20:20.385 --> 20:21.867
Forget it.

20:21.987 --> 20:23.987
Say it.

20:29.561 --> 20:31.638
I can go tell them
it's no good.

20:36.935 --> 20:39.012
No, let's just
get it over with.

21:07.633 --> 21:10.637
[bird cooing]

21:13.171 --> 21:15.516
No, no, no.
We're up at the cottage.

21:18.110 --> 21:20.110
Yesterday.

21:20.912 --> 21:21.994
Yeah, yeah.

21:22.114 --> 21:24.794
Listen, what are you-
what are you up to?

21:26.852 --> 21:28.066
Are you-
are you interested

21:28.186 --> 21:30.263
in coming up
for a night or two?

21:33.692 --> 21:34.673
Yeah.

21:34.793 --> 21:36.793

Hey.
No.

21:54.446 --> 21:55.427
Come here.

21:55.547 --> 21:56.995
Oh, hey.

21:57.115 --> 21:59.131
The door opened
when I knocked.

21:59.251 --> 22:00.232
Brendon!

22:00.352 --> 22:01.300
Call Harris.

22:01.420 --> 22:02.634
Come on, Harris.

22:02.754 --> 22:04.136
Hi.
- Come on!

22:04.256 --> 22:05.938
Sorry.
How did that door open?

22:06.058 --> 22:08.207
Uh, I knocked,
and it just-

22:08.327 --> 22:10.108
You know what, I'm gonna
take a look at it for you.

22:10.228 --> 22:11.843
No, no, that's fine.

22:11.963 --> 22:13.912
One second.

22:14.032 --> 22:15.013
Okay.

22:15.133 --> 22:16.081
It's just kind of stuck.

22:16.201 --> 22:18.083
Hold on a second, Bob.

22:18.203 --> 22:19.718
It's all right.

22:19.838 --> 22:21.587

22:21.707 --> 22:22.821
Okay, hi.

I'm Jane,

22:25.844 --> 22:27.059
or Bob, as he prefers-

22:27.179 --> 22:28.794
and our son Jared.

22:28.914 --> 22:30.362
Hi, I'm Mary.

22:30.482 --> 22:32.564
Oh, you're beautiful.

22:32.684 --> 22:34.399
Thank you.
Thanks.

22:34.519 --> 22:35.567
Thank you.

22:35.687 --> 22:37.102
I'm sorry?

22:37.222 --> 22:38.570
I mean, you're welcome.

22:38.690 --> 22:40.739
I'm silly.
- No.

22:40.859 --> 22:42.859
Hello.

22:45.697 --> 22:47.579
My mother's name
was Mary.

22:47.699 --> 22:48.747
Oh, is that right?

22:48.867 --> 22:51.083
Mary Borden Anwright
was her full name.

22:51.203 --> 22:52.150
Oh.

22:52.270 --> 22:53.385
A lovely lady.

22:53.505 --> 22:55.505
Good.

22:56.575 --> 22:58.123
I'm Bob.

22:58.243 --> 22:59.958
I'm so sorry
if we woke you this morning.

23:00.078 --> 23:01.793
I had no idea
what time it was.

23:01.913 --> 23:05.964
This guy wakes up so early,
doesn't he?

23:06.084 --> 23:08.634
No, it's no problem.

23:08.754 --> 23:11.370
Come on.
Come on in.

23:11.490 --> 23:13.490
[sighs]

23:14.526 --> 23:16.528
I'm an early riser anyway.

23:18.797 --> 23:21.680
Oh, look at this.

23:21.800 --> 23:22.848
You know, I prefer to leave

23:22.968 --> 23:25.817
those everyday restrictions
like time.

23:25.937 --> 23:27.986
Up here, anything goes.

23:28.106 --> 23:29.121
Right, Mark?

23:29.241 --> 23:30.222
That's the goal, yes.

23:30.342 --> 23:31.290
[Bobby whistles]

23:31.410 --> 23:32.391
Thank you.

23:32.511 --> 23:33.558
I'll take those.

23:33.678 --> 23:36.261
By the way,
it's nothing special.

23:36.381 --> 23:37.629
Oh.

23:37.749 --> 23:41.633
Hey, now that's just
plain modesty.

23:41.753 --> 23:43.568
I'm actually not
a salad eater,

23:43.688 --> 23:46.371
but that is surely special.

23:46.491 --> 23:47.506
Hush.

23:47.626 --> 23:49.875
Oh, I'm sure
it's delicious.

23:49.995 --> 23:51.743
Thank you for these.

23:51.863 --> 23:53.245
Let me take your coats.

23:53.365 --> 23:57.249
Hey, Mary,
did-did Mark tell you?

23:57.369 --> 23:58.717
What?

23:58.837 --> 24:00.886
About the wood
we left for you?

24:01.006 --> 24:04.283
Oh, thank you, yes.

24:05.277 --> 24:07.125
We appreciate it.

24:07.245 --> 24:09.194
So how is it,
living up here?

24:09.314 --> 24:10.295
You must get
pretty lonely.

24:10.415 --> 24:13.565
Who said that we lived
up here?

24:13.685 --> 24:15.901
I just, uh...

24:16.021 --> 24:17.936
I just assumed.
Don't you?

24:18.056 --> 24:20.272
Well, for the time being,
sure.

24:20.392 --> 24:23.241
But we got our eyes peeled
for something much better.

24:23.361 --> 24:26.244
I like being alone, so...

24:26.364 --> 24:27.746
it suits me just fine.

24:27.866 --> 24:29.915
And Jared too.
Right, hon?

24:30.035 --> 24:34.052
Right, well, don't you miss
your friends, though, Jared?

24:34.172 --> 24:35.487
You know,
there was another family

24:35.607 --> 24:37.989
lived up here for a while
recently.

24:38.109 --> 24:39.591
Had a boy about his age.

24:39.711 --> 24:41.927
Oh, who's that?

24:42.047 --> 24:44.096
Smith was their name.

24:44.216 --> 24:46.965
Lived out of a car
up the road.

24:47.085 --> 24:48.633
What kind of car?

24:48.753 --> 24:52.137
It was a big beat-up
old station wagon.

24:52.257 --> 24:54.573
Sounded like a freight train.

24:54.693 --> 25:00.579
No, they were
a real sorry-looking bunch.

25:00.699 --> 25:02.581
Low, low, class.

25:02.701 --> 25:03.882
You know?

25:04.002 --> 25:05.784
Kind of a strange air
about them too, huh?

25:05.904 --> 25:08.720
So what happened to them?

25:08.840 --> 25:10.555
They're gone.
I checked.

25:10.675 --> 25:12.677
Not even a tire track.

25:15.280 --> 25:19.398
I think we-l think we
saw them leaving last night.

25:19.518 --> 25:21.896
Well, we're better off,
trust me.

25:26.658 --> 25:28.940
I walked over today.

25:29.060 --> 25:30.909
Do you ever walk
around here, Mary'?

25:31.029 --> 25:32.844
No, no, not lately.

25:32.964 --> 25:34.346
Not much, no.

25:34.466 --> 25:38.151
She'd get lost on her way
to the washroom without a GPS.

25:39.204 --> 25:40.752
Can I offer anyone
some wine?

25:40.872 --> 25:42.454
I mean, we're really-

25:42.574 --> 25:44.022
we don't have a big selection
of whites.

25:44.142 --> 25:46.758
We're mostly red drinkers,
but, um,

25:46.878 --> 25:50.295
we do have a chardonnay
from New Zealand that is unreal,

25:50.415 --> 25:53.131
and pinot, merlot, syrah.

25:53.251 --> 25:54.866
What can I get you?

25:54.986 --> 25:57.035
I'll have whatever
you're having, Mary.

25:57.155 --> 25:58.203
Okay, great.

25:58.323 --> 26:00.323
And what about for you, Bob?

26:02.894 --> 26:04.896
He's deaf sometimes.

26:09.935 --> 26:11.416
Bobby.
- [gasps]

26:11.536 --> 26:12.517
What?

26:12.637 --> 26:14.019
Would you like a beer,
Bob?

26:14.139 --> 26:15.353
Is your boy upstairs?

26:15.473 --> 26:16.788
Excuse me?

26:16.908 --> 26:18.790
Your boy Brendon?

26:18.910 --> 26:19.958
Is he upstairs?

26:20.078 --> 26:21.293
Oh, sure.

26:21.413 --> 26:23.128
All right, squirt,
you head up for dad.

26:23.248 --> 26:24.296
Oh, actually, Jared,

26:24.416 --> 26:25.464
I'd prefer it
if you wait down here.

26:25.584 --> 26:26.932
I'll bring Brendon down
in a minute.

26:27.052 --> 26:29.434
There you go.
Thanks.

26:29.554 --> 26:31.102
You know, I bet
none of the kids your age

26:31.222 --> 26:33.939
pick on you, huh?

26:34.059 --> 26:35.507
[laughs]

26:35.627 --> 26:38.977
I got a hunting rifle
for my birthday.

26:39.097 --> 26:40.378
Oh.

26:40.498 --> 26:44.583
Wow, that's-
happy belated birthday.

26:44.703 --> 26:45.817
Hey!

26:45.937 --> 26:48.747
[laughter]

26:53.778 --> 26:55.527
Come on.

26:55.647 --> 26:58.830
Go ahead, go ahead,
come on.

26:58.950 --> 26:59.898
Do you want the stick?

27:00.018 --> 27:01.199
Are you sure
you want the stick?

27:01.319 --> 27:03.235
Go get it.

27:03.355 --> 27:05.237
[dog barking]

27:05.357 --> 27:06.371
Good boy.

27:06.491 --> 27:07.606
Go get the stick.

27:07.726 --> 27:10.842
There you go.
- You want one?

27:10.962 --> 27:12.962
Oh.

27:15.400 --> 27:17.616
She loathes these things.

27:17.736 --> 27:21.019
Won't get near me for days
if she smells it on me.

27:22.841 --> 27:24.055
Well, you're just gonna
have to

27:24.175 --> 27:26.057
hide it extra hard then.

27:26.177 --> 27:28.177
Thank you.

27:33.685 --> 27:35.685
Thank you.

27:39.491 --> 27:43.496
"Might as well live life
while you can," says Bobby.

27:52.771 --> 27:55.320
Hey, let me
ask you something.

27:55.440 --> 27:58.522
What time does Mark
usually go to bed at night?

28:00.979 --> 28:02.193
I don't know.
It depends.

28:02.313 --> 28:04.529
Why?

28:04.649 --> 28:05.864
Been sleeping a lot lately,

28:05.984 --> 28:10.168
and Jane keeps telling me
it's not normal.

28:10.288 --> 28:11.369

No, it's a good question,
is what it is.

You know,
it sure is good of you

28:22.767 --> 28:24.816

tonight.

28:24.936 --> 28:26.936
Well, not at all.

that's Polish?

28:34.079 --> 28:35.794

I was born here.

29:00.872 --> 29:04.255
I don't hear an accent
from Bob.

29:04.375 --> 29:06.091
We-
actually, it was-

29:06.211 --> 29:08.593
it was just his folks
that lived there,

29:08.713 --> 29:10.715

Gotcha.

You're a good man,
I can tell.

So how long
have you two been married?

29:47.085 --> 29:48.166
Bobby and I
have been married

29:48.286 --> 29:50.789
since the day
he picked me up.

30:08.840 --> 30:09.821
Mm-hmm.

30:09.941 --> 30:12.824
I have a sister, Lizzy.

30:12.944 --> 30:13.992
How about Mark?

30:14.112 --> 30:16.428
Mm-hmm.
He has a younger brother.

30:16.548 --> 30:19.264
You get along
with his brother?

30:19.384 --> 30:21.533
Those glasses
look funny on you.

30:21.653 --> 30:23.653
Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

30:26.157 --> 30:29.172
I don't know.
I could kind of get used to 'em.

30:30.161 --> 30:33.878
So, what, Mark doesn't get along
with his brother, then?

30:33.998 --> 30:36.548
You know, they've had their
ups and downs like any siblings,

30:36.668 --> 30:39.217
but, no, they talk a lot now.

30:39.337 --> 30:40.885
It's good.

30:41.005 --> 30:43.283
What do they usually
disagree over?

30:48.680 --> 30:52.355
I guess they just didn't see
eye-to-eye on most things.

30:54.252 --> 30:55.667
Like what?

30:55.787 --> 30:57.635
You're an awfully
curious fellow.

30:57.755 --> 30:58.703
What-

30:58.823 --> 31:00.939
Hmm?

31:01.059 --> 31:03.471
I'm - l'm just
teasing you, Mary.

31:08.867 --> 31:11.916
It's my way of coping
with nerves.

31:12.036 --> 31:13.251
Truly.

31:13.371 --> 31:15.515
Well, what are you
nervous about?

31:18.676 --> 31:21.392
You're a beautiful lady,
Mary.

31:21.512 --> 31:23.583
You're a wonderful bunch.

to learn something here.

31:30.021 --> 31:35.106
Well, you can be
whoever you are around me, Bob.

31:35.226 --> 31:37.570
Just take Mark's glasses off,
okay?

31:49.674 --> 31:52.056
Can I see Brendan's room?

31:52.176 --> 31:54.559
Um...

31:54.679 --> 31:56.728
If it's okay with Brendon,
Mary, and Mark,

31:56.848 --> 31:58.850
it's okay with me.

32:00.084 --> 32:02.634
Can I see your room,
Brendon?

32:02.754 --> 32:06.304
Yeah, I don't know.
Maybe.

32:06.424 --> 32:07.806
You know,
why don't you go upstairs

32:07.926 --> 32:09.307
and show Jared your games

32:09.427 --> 32:11.437
and then come right back down?

32:23.508 --> 32:26.391
Bob, you said before
that you had a, um...

32:26.511 --> 32:29.694
a conversation
with that family?

32:29.814 --> 32:31.696
Which?

32:31.816 --> 32:33.398
The ones
living in the car.

32:33.518 --> 32:35.867
I'm just - l'm curious
what you said to them.

Well...

32:41.259 --> 32:42.307
[clears throat]

32:42.427 --> 32:45.743
What I said was,

32:45.863 --> 32:47.846
"Be gone."

32:47.966 --> 32:51.115
You know,
"This is a nice neighborhood.

32:51.235 --> 32:53.184
"We don't take
to loitering kindly,

32:53.304 --> 32:57.878
and, you know,
have a nice day."

33:01.512 --> 33:04.696
How'd they take that?

33:04.816 --> 33:07.699
Well, they basically
apologized.

33:07.819 --> 33:08.900
They said, you know,

33:09.020 --> 33:10.902
they were just trying
to get along

33:11.022 --> 33:13.571
like the rest of us.

33:13.691 --> 33:15.073
Actually, they said
the government

33:15.193 --> 33:17.208
had possessed their home
and everything with it,

33:17.328 --> 33:19.328
and they were just...

33:21.232 --> 33:25.783
Looking for what everyone wants,
I suppose.

33:25.903 --> 33:27.619

Which you both know
all about.

Well, everyone has baggage,

aren't you, Mark?

34:07.311 --> 34:09.860
No, we decided it's better
he learn from us

34:09.981 --> 34:13.164
than some busy school.

34:13.284 --> 34:16.333
I watch the crowds of kids
flooding into those places,

34:16.454 --> 34:17.502

"What kind of learning
goes on

34:19.157 --> 34:22.739

Mm-hmm.

myself, so...
