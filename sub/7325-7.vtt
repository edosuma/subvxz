00:02.533 --> 00:06.477
(Milo Green's "1957" playing)

00:06.477 --> 00:09.640
(Meredith) CAN TWO PEOPLE
REALLY BE MEANT TO BE...

00:09.640 --> 00:11.112
(Owen) ...FOR HER PATIENT.
(indistinct conversations)

00:11.112 --> 00:12.443
AND I HAD TO REARRANGE
SOME OF YOUR SURGERIES.
(laughs)

00:12.443 --> 00:14.185
M.F.E.O.?

00:14.185 --> 00:15.716
(speaks indistinctly)
CHECK THE O.R. BOARD
FOR ANY CHANGES.

00:15.716 --> 00:17.648
SOUL MATES?
I HAVE ONE LAST THING TO SAY.

00:17.648 --> 00:20.451
SOME OF YOU, UH, MAY RUN
INTO ARIZONA ROBBINS TODAY.

00:20.451 --> 00:22.123
IT'S HER FIRST DAY BACK.
(cheering)

00:22.123 --> 00:24.725
SO IF YOU SEE HER,
JUST MAKE HER FEEL WELCOME.

00:24.725 --> 00:26.097
OR MAYBE...

00:26.097 --> 00:28.059
MAYBE JUST DON'T
MAKE A BIG DEAL AT ALL.

00:28.059 --> 00:29.029
IT MIGHT BE BETTER.

00:29.029 --> 00:30.331
NOTED. THANK YOU.

00:30.331 --> 00:32.403
OH, OH, HOLD ON. I JUST WANT TO
ADDRESS ONE MORE THING.

00:32.403 --> 00:35.066
UM, MOST OF YOU ARE AWARE
THAT A GROUP OF OUR DOCTORS

00:35.066 --> 00:37.037
HAVE FILED A LAWSUIT
AGAINST OUR HOSPITAL.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.810
SOME OF YOU MAY BE WONDERING
WHAT THIS ALL MEANS

00:39.810 --> 00:41.312
AND HOW IT'S GONNA AFFECT
OUR STAFF.

00:41.312 --> 00:42.813
I'D LIKE TO BE CLEAR.

00:42.813 --> 00:45.516
IT DOESN'T... AT ALL.

00:45.516 --> 00:47.318
LET'S JUST LET THE LAWYERS
WORRY ABOUT THAT.

00:47.318 --> 00:49.049
THAT'S THEIR JOB.

00:49.049 --> 00:51.722
OUR JOB IS TO CONTINUE
TO WORK TOGETHER

00:51.722 --> 00:54.325
AND SUPPORT EACH OTHER IN GIVING
THE GREAT STANDARD OF CARE

00:54.325 --> 00:56.527
THAT WE HAVE ALWAYS GIVEN.

00:56.527 --> 00:59.560
LET'S NOT LET SOMETHING LIKE
THIS GET IN THE WAY OF THAT.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.092
THANK YOU.

01:01.092 --> 01:03.494
IT WOULD BE NICE
IF IT'S TRUE...

01:03.494 --> 01:06.667
THAT WE ALL HAVE SOMEONE
OUT THERE WAITING FOR US...

01:06.667 --> 01:07.838
(indistinct conversations)

01:07.838 --> 01:09.100
US WAITING FOR THEM.

01:09.100 --> 01:11.142
THAT WAS GOOD.

01:20.151 --> 01:21.482
I'M NOT STAYING THERE ANYMORE,

01:21.482 --> 01:23.514

WHAT WE SHOULD DO.

01:23.514 --> 01:25.816
I MEAN, IF WE SHOULD SELL IT
OR...

01:25.816 --> 01:28.289
I WONDERED
WHAT YOU WANTED TO DO.

01:28.289 --> 01:29.790
YOU SHOULD DO
WHAT YOU LIKE.

01:29.790 --> 01:31.522
IT'S YOUR HOUSE.

01:31.522 --> 01:34.865

01:41.632 --> 01:42.803
ARIZONA JUST GOT HERE.

01:42.803 --> 01:44.175
I HAD AN INTERN WAIT
AT THE ENTRANCE

01:44.175 --> 01:45.336
AND THEN TEXT ME
WHEN THEY SAW HER.

01:45.336 --> 01:46.777

01:58.489 --> 02:00.391

02:26.146 --> 02:28.719
UM, OH, THERE'S A 10 YEAR OLD

HE'S A REALLY COOL KID.

02:30.881 --> 02:32.823
YOU'RE GONNA LIKE HIM.

02:32.823 --> 02:34.725
(wheelchair squeaks)

02:34.725 --> 02:38.158
WELL, CALL THEM BACK
AND GET THE DEPOSIT BACK THEN.

02:38.158 --> 02:40.261
WELL, I'M GLAD YOUR SISTER
LIKES THE VIEW,

02:40.261 --> 02:42.633
BUT I'M THE ONE WHO HAS TO

02:56.947 --> 02:59.550

A CHRISTMAS WEDDING...

02:59.550 --> 03:01.552
IN A-A RUSTIC MOUNTAIN LODGE

03:01.552 --> 03:05.185
WITH RED RIBBONS
AND MISTLETOE AND A TREE

03:05.185 --> 03:06.917

03:06.917 --> 03:08.359
AW. THAT SOUNDS BEAUTIFUL.

03:08.359 --> 03:09.520
NO, IT'S STUPID.

03:09.520 --> 03:10.821
WHAT KIND OF
SELF-RESPECTING MAN

03:10.821 --> 03:12.363
CARES THIS MUCH
ABOUT A WEDDING?

03:12.363 --> 03:14.295
I DID.

03:14.295 --> 03:16.927
YEAH, BUT I DID
THE WEDDING THING BEFORE.

03:16.927 --> 03:19.570
I'M GONNA MAKE ALL THOSE PEOPLE
WHO SHOWED UP THE FIRST TIME

03:19.570 --> 03:21.232
SIT THROUGH ANOTHER CEREMONY

03:21.232 --> 03:22.973

I'LL MEAN IT THIS TIME?

03:22.973 --> 03:24.705
YOU WERE THERE
WITH ADELE.

03:24.705 --> 03:25.876
YOU GOT ME
A SET OF RAMEKINS.

03:25.876 --> 03:27.238

TO GET YOU ANOTHER SET.

03:27.238 --> 03:28.208
(sighs)

03:28.208 --> 03:29.380
I WANT TO GET MARRIED
IN A FIELD

03:29.380 --> 03:30.811
WITH WILDFLOWERS EVERYWHERE

03:30.811 --> 03:34.285
AND BUTTERFLIES THAT ARE
RELEASED WHEN I SAY "I DO."

03:34.285 --> 03:35.416
OH, AND I WANT TO HAVE
THESE LITTLE MINTS

03:35.416 --> 03:36.917
THAT SAY "MINT TO BE."

03:36.917 --> 03:39.420
(laughs) YOU GET IT?
'CAUSE THEY'RE MINTS--

03:39.420 --> 03:41.652
THERE WILL BE NO MINTS.
WE'RE GOING TO THE COURTHOUSE,

03:41.652 --> 03:43.794
HAVE A LITTLE
COCKTAIL PARTY AFTER.

03:43.794 --> 03:45.296
YEAH, WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

03:45.296 --> 03:46.957
A MAN WHO PUTS DOWN
A DEPOSIT

03:46.957 --> 03:48.759
IS A MAN WHO MEANS BUSINESS.

03:48.759 --> 03:50.761
WELL, HE HAS TILL THE 12th
TO GET HIS MONEY BACK.

03:50.761 --> 03:52.303
THAT'S TWO DAYS.

03:52.303 --> 03:54.935
HE'D NEED TWO YEARS TO GET ME
TO AGREE TO A WEDDING

03:54.935 --> 03:56.867
WITH SANTA CLAUS
RUNNING AROUND.

03:56.867 --> 03:59.310

03:59.310 --> 04:02.313
WAIT.
UM, TODAY'S THE 10th?

YEP.

04:05.546 --> 04:06.947
(mutters)

04:06.947 --> 04:08.779
IT WAS GOOD THAT OWEN
SAID THAT ABOUT THE LAWSUIT.

04:08.779 --> 04:11.422
WHAT, HIS "ONE BIG,
HAPPY FAMILY" CRAP?

04:11.422 --> 04:13.384
IT'S VERY SWEET
UNLESS YOU'RE ME.

04:13.384 --> 04:14.555
IT NEEDED TO BE SAID.

04:14.555 --> 04:15.726
YEAH, UNLESS YOU'RE
THE DEFORMED WIFE

04:15.726 --> 04:16.887
CHAINED IN THE ATTIC.

04:16.887 --> 04:18.429
WELL, WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO BE TO HIM?

04:18.429 --> 04:20.461
YOU LEFT HIM. DO YOU WANT
TO BE SOMETHING ELSE?

04:20.461 --> 04:21.792
WELL, I DON'T WANT
TO BE CHAINED IN THE ATTIC.

04:21.792 --> 04:23.334
HEY, GUYS,
HAVE YOU SEEN JACKSON?

04:23.334 --> 04:24.495
HE'S NOT ANSWERING
MY TEXTS.

04:24.495 --> 04:26.637
WHY, YOU LOOKING FOR SOME
JACKSON ACTION? (laughs)

04:26.637 --> 04:27.798
(laughs)

04:27.798 --> 04:29.300
OH, MY GOD.
WHAT DID I TELL YOU?

04:29.300 --> 04:31.402
30 YEARS AS A NUN,
SHE CANNOT GET ENOUGH.

04:31.402 --> 04:32.703
UM, SO YOU HAVEN'T SEEN HIM?

04:32.703 --> 04:34.845
NO, BUT WE WILL TELL HIM

04:34.845 --> 04:36.677
THAT YOU REALLY, REALLY,
REALLY NEED TO SEE HIM IF--

04:36.677 --> 04:38.008
(sighs)

04:38.008 --> 04:39.480
BYE, APRIL.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.382
OKAY, SO IF WE GO
TO THE AXILLA...

04:41.382 --> 04:43.013
(beeping)
AND THEN DOWN THE FOREARM
TO GRAB THE M.A.B.C.,

04:43.013 --> 04:44.355
THERE ARE TWO BRANCHES.

04:44.355 --> 04:45.716
OKAY, NOW THIS IS
THE REALLY COOL PART, OKAY?

04:45.716 --> 04:47.057
(chuckles) IT'S SO FREAKIN'
STATE-OF-THE-ART,

04:47.057 --> 04:48.389
I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE
IT EXISTS.

04:48.389 --> 04:49.720
THAT'S A LOT OF BUILD-UP.
BETTER BE GOOD.

04:49.720 --> 04:50.891
(chuckles)

04:50.891 --> 04:52.893
WE TAKE
JUST THE ANTERIOR BRANCH

04:52.893 --> 04:55.426
AND WE USE THAT PART
FOR THE CABLE GRAFT.

04:55.426 --> 04:56.827
WHAT ELSE YOU GOT?

04:56.827 --> 04:58.529
DID YOU HEAR
WHAT I JUST SAID?

04:58.529 --> 05:00.901
YEAH.
WHAT ELSE YOU GOT?

05:03.303 --> 05:04.475
OKAY. YEAH.
(beeps)

05:04.475 --> 05:05.936
WE COULD, UM...
(cell phone chimes)

05:05.936 --> 05:07.478
AN END-TO-SIDE TRANSFER.

05:07.478 --> 05:10.010
THE, UM, STATISTICS
ARE REALLY, REALLY GOOD.

05:10.010 --> 05:11.442
UM--
WHAT ELSE?

05:12.613 --> 05:13.814
DEREK, I WENT TO THE TROUBLE
OF MAKING A SLIDE.

05:13.814 --> 05:14.985
COULD YOU PLEASE
LOOK AT IT?

05:14.985 --> 05:16.347
YOU KNOW
AS WELL AS I DO

05:16.347 --> 05:17.888
THAT THOSE STATS
COME FROM STUDIES ON RATS.

05:17.888 --> 05:20.951
AND AS FAR
AS THE END-TO-SIDE TRANSFER,

05:20.951 --> 05:22.493
YEAH, IT'S STATE-OF-THE-ART,

05:22.493 --> 05:24.425
BUT ONCE YOU TAKE AWAY
MY GOOD NERVE,

05:24.425 --> 05:27.458
I WILL HAVE LESS FUNCTION
THAN I DID BEFORE.

05:27.458 --> 05:29.700
YOU DON'T HAVE IT.
KEEP TRYING.

05:29.700 --> 05:31.362
(door opens)
I PRACTICED
WITH ARIZONA LAST NIGHT.

05:31.362 --> 05:33.604
SHE MADE A MUCH MORE
ENTHUSIASTIC DEREK.

05:33.604 --> 05:35.966
(people speaking indistinctly)

05:35.966 --> 05:38.439
(siren wailing)

05:38.439 --> 05:40.010
WHAT'S WRONG?

05:40.010 --> 05:41.672
DR. BAILEY,

05:41.672 --> 05:44.475
DID YOU KNOW THE TEN COLDEST
COUNTIES IN THE COUNTRY

05:44.475 --> 05:46.016
ARE ALL LOCATED
IN MINNESOTA?

05:46.016 --> 05:49.450
UM, YOU'RE GLAD TO BE BACK.
I'M GLAD YOU'RE GLAD.

05:49.450 --> 05:50.881
NOW DID YOU DOUBLE-CHECK

05:50.881 --> 05:52.823
THE HISTORY OF THE HEART VALVE
LIKE I ASKED?
GRUMPY.

05:52.823 --> 05:54.455
YES, AND BASED ON
THE HISTORY,

05:54.455 --> 05:56.487
WE'VE CHOSEN
A PERICARDIAL BIOPROSTHESIS.

05:56.487 --> 05:57.628
I MADE SURE THE O.R.
HAS IT READY.

05:57.628 --> 05:59.129
OKAY, AND, DR. ROSS,

05:59.129 --> 06:01.061
YOU TOOK CARE
OF OUR ROOM SITUATION?

06:01.061 --> 06:02.433
EAST-FACING WINDOW
LIKE HE LIKES.

06:02.433 --> 06:03.394
IT'S ALSO PRIVATE.

06:03.394 --> 06:04.895
GOOD. OKAY.
(brakes squeal)

06:04.895 --> 06:07.568
(siren whoops)

06:07.568 --> 06:08.899
HEY.

06:08.899 --> 06:10.441
(man) WE'VE ARRIVED!

06:10.441 --> 06:11.942
HI.
DR. BAILEY!

06:11.942 --> 06:13.103
(laughs)

06:13.103 --> 06:14.445
HOW DOES THE LIVER LOOK?
IS IT A GOOD ONE?

06:14.445 --> 06:15.906
THE BEST.

06:15.906 --> 06:17.578
DR. ROSS SPENT THE LAST 24 HOURS
ON THE PHONE WITH U.N.O.S.

06:17.578 --> 06:19.450
TO MAKE SURE IT DIDN'T GO
ANYWHERE ELSE.

06:19.450 --> 06:21.081
THEY WERE THREATENING
TO SEND IT TO PORTLAND,

06:21.081 --> 06:23.414
BUT I WENT ALL "DR. BAILEY"
ON 'EM.

06:23.414 --> 06:24.915
(laughs) THAT'S MY MAN.
(laughs)

06:24.915 --> 06:27.387
A LITTLE THANK-YOU
FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK.

06:27.387 --> 06:28.559
THANK YOU.
OH.

06:28.559 --> 06:29.890
FOR YOU.
WHITE BIRCH ROSEMARY.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.391
(gasp) AND...
LOOK AT YOU.

06:31.391 --> 06:32.723
WHAT'S NEW
ON THE WEDDING FRONT?

06:32.723 --> 06:34.064
HAVE YOU GOTTEN
A WEDDING DRESS?

06:34.064 --> 06:35.395
YOU KNOW IT'S ALL ABOUT
THE DRESS.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.428
MM.

06:37.428 --> 06:38.569
HE GOT KNOCKED DOWN
BY SOME WOMAN AT THE MALL

06:38.569 --> 06:40.030
AND FELL PRETTY HARD
INTO A PERFUME STAND.

06:40.030 --> 06:41.872
HE'S GOT SOME ABDOMINAL PAIN
AND A DEEP LAC ON HIS HAND.

06:41.872 --> 06:43.474
ALL RIGHT.
WHY AREN'T YOU SUTURING HIM?

06:43.474 --> 06:44.635
I PAGED PLASTICS.

06:44.635 --> 06:45.976
THE PATIENT'S
A LITTLE DIFFICULT.

06:45.976 --> 06:47.508
OKAY, WELL, YOU'RE A DOCTOR.

06:47.508 --> 06:48.639
IT'S YOUR JOB
TO DEAL WITH DIFFICULT.

06:48.639 --> 06:49.910
I KNOW, BUT...

06:49.910 --> 06:51.512
MR. FREEMAN,
I'M DR. GREY.

06:51.512 --> 06:52.783
DO YOU MIND
IF I EXAMINE YOU?

06:52.783 --> 06:53.944
ALL YOURS.

06:53.944 --> 06:55.486
GREAT. OKAY.

06:55.486 --> 06:57.488
(indistinct conversations)

06:57.488 --> 06:59.550
PLEASE LET ME KNOW
IF YOU FEEL ANY PAIN--

06:59.550 --> 07:00.691
(groans)
I'M SORRY. AAH!

07:00.691 --> 07:02.593
DAD!
I AM SO SORRY.

07:02.593 --> 07:04.424
IGNORE HIM.

07:04.424 --> 07:05.996
DAD, I SWEAR TO GOD.

07:05.996 --> 07:07.658
THIS IS WHY DANNY AND TIM
DON'T TALK TO YOU ANYMORE.

07:07.658 --> 07:09.560
I NEVER GRABBED TIM'S ASS.

07:09.560 --> 07:10.861
NO, YOU GRABBED
TIM'S WIFE'S ASS,

07:10.861 --> 07:12.202
AND DANNY'S WIFE.

07:12.202 --> 07:14.935
IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.106
OKAY.

07:16.106 --> 07:17.468
I NEED YOU TO LEAN FORWARD
FOR ME.

07:17.468 --> 07:18.669
AND TAKE A DEEP BREATH
FOR ME, PLEASE.

07:18.669 --> 07:20.541
(inhales and exhales deeply)

07:20.541 --> 07:21.942
ANOTHER ONE.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.674
OH. AND WE'RE DONE HERE.
(elevator bell dings)

07:23.674 --> 07:25.476
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

07:25.476 --> 07:26.577
IT'S A COMPLIMENT.

07:26.577 --> 07:27.678
IT'S HORRIFYING.

07:27.678 --> 07:28.779
(sighs)

07:28.779 --> 07:29.850
I TRIED TO WARN YOU.

07:29.850 --> 07:31.021
YOU DID A LOUSY JOB.

07:31.021 --> 07:32.583
THERE'S SOME
ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS,

07:32.583 --> 07:33.554
SO LET'S GET A C.T.,

07:33.554 --> 07:34.725
AND GET ME THE RESULTS
RIGHT AWAY.

07:34.725 --> 07:35.886
GREY, I JUST GOT
OUT OF SURGERY.

07:35.886 --> 07:37.227
YOU GOT A PATIENT
WITH A HAND LAC?

07:37.227 --> 07:38.859
YEAH, HE'S OVER THERE.
AND WATCH YOUR ASS.

07:38.859 --> 07:40.190
(ding)
WHAT DO--

07:40.190 --> 07:42.563
JACKSON,
UH, WE NEED TO TALK.

07:42.563 --> 07:44.595
I...

07:44.595 --> 07:45.766
(whispers) RIGHT NOW.

07:45.766 --> 07:47.498
ALL RIGHT.

07:47.498 --> 07:48.899
(indistinct conversations)

07:48.899 --> 07:50.871
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

07:50.871 --> 07:53.574
WHAT'S UP?

07:53.574 --> 07:55.576
I'M LATE.

07:55.576 --> 07:56.947
FOR WHAT?

07:56.947 --> 07:59.249
FOUR DAYS. I HAVE NEVER BEEN
FOUR DAYS LATE IN MY LIFE.

07:59.249 --> 08:02.683
FOUR DAYS LATE FOR... OH.

08:02.683 --> 08:05.656
OH.

08:05.656 --> 08:08.589
OH... OH...

08:09.790 --> 08:17.668
(siren wailing)

08:17.668 --> 08:19.229
(people speak indistinctly)

08:22.573 --> 08:24.074
OF COURSE.

08:24.074 --> 08:26.937
JUST WHEN I START THINKING
THAT MAYBE THIS COULD WORK--

08:26.937 --> 08:28.939
SOMETHING THAT FEELS SO GOOD
CAN'T BE BAD, RIGHT?

08:28.939 --> 08:32.683
I-I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE JESUS IS
OKAY WITH PREMARITAL SEX.

08:32.683 --> 08:34.044
HE MADE THAT RULE WHEN PEOPLE
GOT MARRIED AT 16.

08:34.044 --> 08:36.587
HE NEVER EXPECTED PEOPLE
TO WAIT TILL THEY WERE 30.

08:36.587 --> 08:37.918
BUT NOW I HAVE
A BABY IN MY UTERUS,

08:37.918 --> 08:39.720
AND IT IS CLEAR
THAT HE IS NOT OKAY WITH IT.

08:39.720 --> 08:42.122
OKAY, JESUS. I GET IT.

08:42.122 --> 08:43.694
RELAX, OKAY?
Y-YOU'RE NOT PREGNANT.

08:43.694 --> 08:46.526
I AM A CLOCK.
I AM NEVER LATE.

08:46.526 --> 08:47.898
WE USE CONDOMS.
CONDOMS BREAK.

08:47.898 --> 08:49.159
THEY DON'T BREAK.
WH--

08:49.159 --> 08:51.001
SOMETIMES THEY BREAK.
JUST...

08:51.001 --> 08:53.203
W-- (sighs) WE'RE GONNA
HAVE YOU PEE ON A STICK,

08:53.203 --> 08:54.264
AND WE'LL KNOW
IN FIVE MINUTES.

08:54.264 --> 08:56.937
NO. NO. THOSE THINGS CAN
GIVE OFF FALSE POSITIVES.

08:56.937 --> 08:58.108
IT--IT HAS TO BE
A BLOOD TEST.

08:58.108 --> 08:59.239
FINE. YOU'RE RIGHT.

08:59.239 --> 09:01.111
WE'LL GO DRAW YOUR BLOOD
RIGHT NOW. OKAY?

09:01.111 --> 09:02.873
UH-HUH.

09:02.873 --> 09:04.214
(exhales)

09:04.214 --> 09:05.876
JACKSON...

09:05.876 --> 09:08.148
HEY, WE ARE NOT GONNA WORRY

09:08.148 --> 09:10.721
UNTIL WE KNOW FOR SURE.

09:10.721 --> 09:12.753
OKAY?
OKAY.

09:16.657 --> 09:19.159
DR. KEPNER,
WE NEED YOU.

09:19.159 --> 09:21.131
14 YEAR OLD
IN A HORSEBACK RIDING ACCIDENT.

09:21.131 --> 09:22.963
HYPOTENSIVE AND BLEEDING
THROUGH HIS BANDAGES.

09:22.963 --> 09:24.064
I'M AROUND ALL DAY,

09:24.064 --> 09:25.996
SO JUST, UH,
JUST TEXT ME LATER.

09:25.996 --> 09:28.238
(April) UH, WEXLER, LEWIS,
TRAUMA ONE NOW.

09:28.238 --> 09:29.870
HEY, AVERY, YOU'RE HELPING ME
RESEARCH A PLAN

09:29.870 --> 09:31.171
FOR SHEPHERD'S HAND TODAY.

09:31.171 --> 09:32.172
UH, CAN IT WAIT?

09:32.172 --> 09:33.343
I'M A LITTLE BUSY.

09:33.343 --> 09:35.175
OH, WELL, EVERY SECOND,

09:35.175 --> 09:36.977
THE NERVE IS DYING
A LITTLE BIT MORE.

09:36.977 --> 09:38.909
AS WE STAND HERE AND ARGUE,
HIS NERVE IS DYING.

09:38.909 --> 09:40.080
YES, BUT--

09:40.080 --> 09:41.251
OH, HIS NERVE DIED
JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE.

09:41.251 --> 09:42.813
LET'S GO. SNAP, SNAP.

09:42.813 --> 09:44.254
(indistinct conversations)

09:44.254 --> 09:46.356
HUNT.
NICE SPEECH THIS MORNING.

09:46.356 --> 09:48.919
VERY, UH, "ONCE MORE UNTO
THE BREACH, DEAR FRIENDS."

09:48.919 --> 09:51.161
SHAKESPEARE. YOU KNOW,
"HENRY V."

09:51.161 --> 09:52.122
YEAH.

09:52.122 --> 09:53.293
I MEAN,
THE POINT IS THAT YOU--

09:53.293 --> 09:54.825
YOU'RE HANDLING
ALL THIS WELL.

09:54.825 --> 09:56.867
THANKS.
YOU, UH, NEED SOMETHING?

09:56.867 --> 09:58.198
UH, JUST CHECKING IN.

09:58.198 --> 09:59.700
YOU--YOU ALL RIGHT
WITH THIS, UH, MEETING?

09:59.700 --> 10:01.732
YEAH, I'M JUST TELLING THEM
WHAT HAPPENED. WHY?

10:01.732 --> 10:03.734
UH, OH, NO REASON.

10:03.734 --> 10:05.976
IT'S JUST, UM, YOU KNOW,
A LAWSUIT LIKE THIS,

10:05.976 --> 10:08.679
UH, REMINDS A HOSPITAL
THAT IT'S A BUSINESS.

10:08.679 --> 10:10.340
THE ANGLES CHANGE
PRETTY QUICKLY.

10:10.340 --> 10:12.312
SO DON'T LET 'EM BACK YOU
IN A CORNER.

10:12.312 --> 10:14.084
I SHOULD BE FINE.

10:14.084 --> 10:16.216
OF COURSE. OF COURSE. LOOK,
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

10:16.216 --> 10:17.818
JUST IGNORE ME. (chuckles)

10:17.818 --> 10:20.721
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

10:20.721 --> 10:21.892
(door opens)

10:21.892 --> 10:23.153
(man) DR. HUNT,

10:23.153 --> 10:24.855
AS I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE,
MEMBERS OF YOUR STAFF

10:24.855 --> 10:26.857
HAVE NOW LODGED
AN OFFICIAL COMPLAINT

10:26.857 --> 10:29.159
WITH INTENT TO SUE SEATTLE GRACE
MERCY WEST HOSPITAL.
I AM.

10:29.159 --> 10:31.401
SO TODAY IS JUST
A PRELIMINARY INTERVIEW

10:31.401 --> 10:33.403
TO PREPARE
THE HOSPITAL'S CASE.

10:33.403 --> 10:34.905
MM-HMM.

10:34.905 --> 10:36.206
THIS IS
A CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT.

10:36.206 --> 10:38.108
YOU CAN LOOK IT OVER.
IT JUST SAYS THAT--

10:38.108 --> 10:40.210
YOU SHOULD MAKE NOTE THAT
IT SPECIFICALLY MENTIONS

10:40.210 --> 10:41.371
YOUR WIFE--DR. CRISTINA YANG--

10:41.371 --> 10:43.273
AS ONE OF THE PLAINTIFFS
IN THE CASE.

10:43.273 --> 10:44.875
YEAH, I SAW THAT.

10:44.875 --> 10:47.347
SO WE UNDERSTAND, THIS IS
AN UNUSUAL SITUATION FOR YOU

10:47.347 --> 10:49.249
AND A CLEAR CONFLICT OF INTEREST
FOR THE HOSPITAL.

10:49.249 --> 10:52.052
DON'T WORRY. WHATEVER WE
SAY HERE WILL STAY HERE.

10:52.052 --> 10:55.125
GREAT. NO AWKWARD CONVERSATIONS
AROUND THE DINNER TABLE.

10:55.125 --> 10:56.326
(laughs)

10:56.326 --> 10:58.859
OKAY, SO LET'S START

10:58.859 --> 11:02.292
WITH WHY YOUR TEAM FLEW TO
BOISE MEMORIAL ON THAT DAY.

11:02.292 --> 11:05.165
BOISE ASKED US TO HELP WITH
A CONJOINED TWIN SEPARATION.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.336
WE'D HAD SUCCESS WITH

11:06.336 --> 11:09.239
A VERY COMPLICATED PROCEDURE
MONTHS EARLIER.

11:09.239 --> 11:10.871
GRAHAM CUNNINGHAM, 65,

11:10.871 --> 11:13.203
PRESENTED WITH CIRRHOSIS
APPROXIMATELY SEVEN YEARS AGO.

11:13.203 --> 11:14.174
HE'S NOW
IN END-STAGE LIVER DISEASE

11:14.174 --> 11:15.345
AND HAS SUBSEQUENTLY

11:15.345 --> 11:16.707
ALSO DEVELOPED
VALVULAR HEART DISEASE.

11:16.707 --> 11:18.208
WELL DONE, DR. ROSS.

11:18.208 --> 11:19.750
I'VE BEEN PRACTICING.

11:19.750 --> 11:21.081
WHY DIDN'T WE TREAT
THIS VALVE DISEASE EAR--

11:21.081 --> 11:22.913
RIGHT AWAY? BECAUSE
THE VALVE REPLACEMENT SURGERY

11:22.913 --> 11:24.254
WOULD'VE CAUSED
HIS LIVER TO FAIL.

11:24.254 --> 11:25.215
BUT THE LIVER TRANSPLANT

11:25.215 --> 11:26.817
WOULD'VE CAUSED
HIS HEART TO FAIL.

11:26.817 --> 11:28.318
THAT'S WHY WE'LL DO
BOTH SURGERIES TODAY.

11:28.318 --> 11:30.690
FIRST THE VALVE REPLACEMENT,
THEN THE LIVER TRANSPLANT.

11:30.690 --> 11:31.892
GOOD.

11:31.892 --> 11:33.824
YOU ALMOST MAKE ME
WANT TO LEARN YOUR NAME.

11:33.824 --> 11:35.225
(elevator bell dings)

11:35.225 --> 11:37.067
(man) DR. B., YOU'RE CONFIDENT
THIS LIVER'S THE ONE?

11:37.067 --> 11:38.769
WE'RE NOT GONNA GET HALFWAY
TO THE O.R.

11:38.769 --> 11:40.270
AND HAVE TO TURN AROUND
LIKE LAST TIME?

11:40.270 --> 11:42.432
ALL SIGNS POINT TO
THIS BEING THE ONE.

11:42.432 --> 11:44.905
WE JUST HAD TO DATE
A BUNCH OF OTHERS TO FIND IT.

11:44.905 --> 11:46.076
KIND OF LIKE YOU,

11:46.076 --> 11:48.338
KISSING ALL THOSE FROGS
BEFORE YOU MET ME.

11:48.338 --> 11:49.740
(chuckling)

11:49.740 --> 11:51.311
(chuckles)

11:51.311 --> 11:54.284
A DIRTY OLD MAN
TOUCHED MY BUTT TODAY, TWICE.

11:54.284 --> 11:55.816
REALLY?

11:55.816 --> 11:56.987
MM-HMM.

11:56.987 --> 11:58.318
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?
HOW WAS CALLIE?

11:58.318 --> 11:59.489
WELL,
SHE DIDN'T TOUCH MY BUTT.

11:59.489 --> 12:01.021
MM-HMM.
MM-HMM.

12:01.021 --> 12:02.192
DEREK.
WHAT?

12:02.192 --> 12:03.393
I ALL FOR BURYING THINGS
WITH SEX,

12:03.393 --> 12:05.255
BUT THIS IS YOUR CAREER.

12:05.255 --> 12:06.426
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT?

12:06.426 --> 12:08.128
YES.

12:08.128 --> 12:09.960
WHY DO THE SURGERY AT ALL?

12:09.960 --> 12:12.062
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO SPEND MORE TIME FISHING.

12:12.062 --> 12:14.404
I JUST GOT ZOLA
HER FIRST FISHING POLE.

12:14.404 --> 12:16.406
IT'S PINK. (laughs)

12:16.406 --> 12:18.869
(laughs)

12:18.869 --> 12:20.210
DEREK.

12:20.210 --> 12:22.172
THERE IS NO GOOD SOLUTION.

12:22.172 --> 12:23.313
THERE'S HALF FIXES.

12:23.313 --> 12:26.146
MAYBE THERE'S MORE FUNCTION.
MAYBE THERE'S NOT.

12:26.146 --> 12:28.879
AND IF THEY CAN'T FIX IT,
THEN THAT'S IT.

12:28.879 --> 12:30.951
IT'S DONE. IT'S OVER.

12:30.951 --> 12:33.283
IT'S NOT OVER.
YOU FIND A FIX.

12:33.283 --> 12:34.254
YOU USED TO BE
SO DARK AND TWISTY.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.425
NOW YOU'RE OPTIMISTIC.

12:35.425 --> 12:37.057
(laughs)

12:37.057 --> 12:38.458
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT ME.

12:38.458 --> 12:40.060
LET'S JUST NOT TALK AT ALL.

12:40.060 --> 12:42.132
MM.
(laughs)

12:42.132 --> 12:43.794
THAT'S IT. GOOD.

12:43.794 --> 12:45.195
(squeaking)

12:45.195 --> 12:47.197
AVOID TWISTING
THE CABLES TOO TIGHTLY

12:47.197 --> 12:49.139
OR THEY'LL CUT THROUGH
THE STERNUM.
MM-HMM.

12:49.139 --> 12:51.001
WHAT IS THIS I HEAR ABOUT
YOU LETTING YOUR INTERN

12:51.001 --> 12:52.302
DO A PROCEDURE ON MY PATIENT?

12:52.302 --> 12:53.844
YOU TATTLED ON ME?

12:53.844 --> 12:55.345
I DIDN'T SPEND THE LAST
THREE MONTHS ON LIVER WATCH

12:55.345 --> 12:56.546
SO YOU COULD KILL THIS GUY.

12:56.546 --> 12:58.408
HEY, NO ONE'S
KILLING ANYONE.

12:58.408 --> 13:00.280
SHE'S GOOD.
BETTER THAN YOU.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.252
NO GLOATING.

13:02.252 --> 13:03.553
YANG.

13:03.553 --> 13:04.815
(knob squeaks)

13:07.287 --> 13:10.220
DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG
THIS MAN'S WAITED FOR A LIVER?

13:10.220 --> 13:12.823
SO LONG HE WAS MARRIED
TO A WOMAN

13:12.823 --> 13:13.994
THE FIRST TIME
HE CAME IN HERE.

13:13.994 --> 13:15.425
NOW HE'S COME OUT.

13:15.425 --> 13:17.297
HE'S MET THE MAN HE'S MEANT TO
SPEND THE REST OF HIS LIFE WITH.

13:17.297 --> 13:20.330
THIS IS NOT THE MAN
WE LET AN INTERN PRACTICE ON.

13:20.330 --> 13:23.103
OKAY, RELAX.
SHE WON'T DO IT.

13:23.103 --> 13:25.906
SINCE WHEN DID YOU BECOME
SUCH A ROMANTIC?

13:25.906 --> 13:27.177
(scoffs)

13:29.809 --> 13:31.381
OH, BOO-HOO.

13:31.381 --> 13:34.244
YOU'RE LUCKY YOU EVEN GET
TO WORK WITH ME.

13:34.244 --> 13:36.016
(siren wails)

13:36.016 --> 13:37.317
(people speaking indistinctly)

13:37.317 --> 13:39.319
DOES THAT HURT AT ALL, SEAN?

13:39.319 --> 13:41.191
GOOD. GOOD.

13:41.191 --> 13:43.123
ALL RIGHT.
YOU HAVING ANY FUN HERE?

13:43.123 --> 13:44.554
I HEARD THERE WAS
A PRO BASKETBALL PLAYER

13:44.554 --> 13:46.026
MAKING HIS WAY
AROUND THE HALLS HERE.

13:46.026 --> 13:47.427
DID YOU GET TO MEET HIM?
TALL GUY.

13:47.427 --> 13:49.359
HE PROBABLY HIT HIS HEAD
ON THE DOOR ON THE WAY IN.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.604
ALL RIGHT. WELL, WE WILL, UM,
CHECK BACK WITH YOU LATER.

13:54.604 --> 13:57.037
BYE.

13:57.037 --> 14:00.340
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

14:00.340 --> 14:03.443
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

14:04.875 --> 14:06.216
GOOD JOB.

14:06.216 --> 14:08.348
YOU SAID $20 IF I DIDN'T ASK
ABOUT THE FAKE LEG.

14:08.348 --> 14:09.519
I ONLY GOT $10 ON ME.

14:09.519 --> 14:10.921
THEN NEXT TIME SHE COMES IN,

14:10.921 --> 14:12.352
I'M GONNA TELL HER
HOW YOU TOLD ME

14:12.352 --> 14:13.353
THAT I COULDN'T
SAY ANYTHING.

14:13.353 --> 14:16.056
(elevator bell dings)

14:17.487 --> 14:19.189
KEEP YOUR TRAP SHUT.

14:19.189 --> 14:21.361
(chuckles)

14:21.361 --> 14:23.033
HEY, IS HE ALWAYS
THAT QUIET?

14:23.033 --> 14:24.935
OH, YEAH. STRANGE KID.

14:24.935 --> 14:26.466
DR. ROBBINS, DR. KEPNER
NEEDS SOME EXTRA HANDS

14:26.466 --> 14:28.468
ON A HORSE TRAMPLING--
14 YEAR OLD.

14:28.468 --> 14:30.440
ALL RIGHT. TELL 'EM
WE'RE ON OUR WAY.

14:30.440 --> 14:32.872
YEAH. UM, I'LL CATCH UP
WITH YOU.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.104
NO, I CAN WAIT.

14:34.104 --> 14:35.505
NO, A KID GOT TRAMPLED
BY A HORSE, ALEX. GO.

14:35.505 --> 14:39.549
(people speaking indistinctly)

14:39.549 --> 14:42.552
(squeaking)

14:45.315 --> 14:47.557
CAN I HELP YOU?

14:47.557 --> 14:49.019
NO. UM...

14:49.019 --> 14:51.461
I JUST GOT LOST

14:51.461 --> 14:53.523
ON MY WAY TO...

14:53.523 --> 14:55.425
RADIOLOGY.

14:55.425 --> 14:58.498
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

14:58.498 --> 15:01.001
(wheelchair squeaks)

15:01.001 --> 15:02.172
CAN YOU TAKE OVER
THE ULTRASOUND?

15:02.172 --> 15:03.503
HE'S GOT ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS,

15:03.503 --> 15:04.634
AND I NEED TO GET
CONTROL OF THIS BLEEDING.

15:04.634 --> 15:06.406
I THINK HE MAY HAVE LACERATED
HIS FEMORAL VEIN.

15:06.406 --> 15:09.039
MY SNEAKERS.
WHAT'S THAT?

15:09.039 --> 15:10.140
DON'T LOSE MY SNEAKERS.

15:10.140 --> 15:11.481
THEY'RE 200 BUCKS.

15:11.481 --> 15:13.283
THAT'S WHY HIS LEG
SLIPPED THROUGH THE STIRRUP.

15:13.283 --> 15:15.415
YOU HAVE TO WEAR A SHOE WITH
A HEEL WHEN YOU RIDE A HORSE.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.916
KID SPENDS 200 BUCKS
ON SNEAKERS,

15:16.916 --> 15:18.688
HE'S OBVIOUSLY NOT THE KING
OF AWESOME CHOICES.

15:18.688 --> 15:19.990
ALL RIGHT,
THERE'S POSSIBLE BLOOD

15:19.990 --> 15:21.091
ON THE UPPER LEFT QUADRANT.

15:21.091 --> 15:22.392
GREAT. LET'S GET HIM
UP TO C.T.

15:22.392 --> 15:23.523
HOLD ON. WAIT FOR ROBBINS.

15:23.523 --> 15:25.425
UH, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
SHE'S ON HER WAY.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.427
HE JUST GOT DRAGGED
20 YARDS BY A HORSE.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.159
HE'S TOTALLY STABLE.
LOOK, IT'S HER FIRST DAY BACK.

15:29.159 --> 15:30.330
HE DID A STUPID THING.

15:30.330 --> 15:31.501
I'M NOT GONNA LET IT
RUIN HIS LIFE.

15:31.501 --> 15:32.662
LET'S MOVE THIS GURNEY
RIGHT NOW.

15:32.662 --> 15:34.434
(man) RIGHT AWAY, DOCTOR.

15:34.434 --> 15:35.535
(woman) OKAY, SOMEBODY STEP OUT
AND CALL (speaks indistinctly).

15:35.535 --> 15:37.537
LET'S GO.

15:37.537 --> 15:40.540
(people speaking indistinctly)

15:47.647 --> 15:49.249
IT LOOKS LIKE...

15:49.249 --> 15:52.983
THERE'S SOME CALCIFICATION
OF THE AORTIC ANNULUS HERE?

15:52.983 --> 15:54.354
IS THAT A STATEMENT
OR A QUESTION?

15:54.354 --> 15:55.685
I...

15:55.685 --> 15:57.257
WILL CHECK AGAIN.
MM-HMM.

15:57.257 --> 15:58.588
(people speaking indistinctly)

15:58.588 --> 15:59.959
(Graham) OH, NO.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.292
LOOK AT THAT.
HE COMES BEARING BAD NEWS.

16:02.292 --> 16:03.963
IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.495
THE PLANE TAKING THE TRANSPLANT
TEAM GOT DELAYED BY RAIN.

16:05.495 --> 16:06.666
WE'LL KNOW MORE IN AN HOUR.

16:06.666 --> 16:08.098
WE'VE HEARD THAT BEFORE.

16:08.098 --> 16:10.600
YOU DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE THIS IS A GOOD THING.

16:10.600 --> 16:12.702
LIKE MAYBE THE PLANE
HAS TO BE LATE

16:12.702 --> 16:15.305
SO THE TRANSPORT AMBULANCE

16:15.305 --> 16:16.976
DOESN'T CRASH INTO
AN 18-WHEELER.

16:16.976 --> 16:19.049
THINGS HAPPEN FOR A REASON.

16:19.049 --> 16:20.280
HERE WE GO.

16:20.280 --> 16:21.311
WELL, THEY DO.

16:21.311 --> 16:22.582
I ALWAYS SAY,

16:22.582 --> 16:25.515
I WOULD NEVER HAVE MET HANK
IF MY EX--CAROL--

16:25.515 --> 16:27.257
HADN'T FORCED US
TO MOVE TO SEATTLE

16:27.257 --> 16:28.588
TO BE CLOSER TO HER FAMILY.

16:28.588 --> 16:30.290
YOU WASTED 30 YEARS
IN THAT MARRIAGE.

16:30.290 --> 16:33.123
NO, IT WASN'T A WASTE.
IT GOT ME HERE. I MET YOU.

16:33.123 --> 16:35.295
30 YEARS TOO LATE.
BETTER LATE THAN NEVER.

16:35.295 --> 16:37.197
THINGS DON'T ALWAYS HAPPEN
FOR A REASON, GRAHAM.

16:37.197 --> 16:39.999
I WAS ALONE ALL THAT TIME,
AND YOU WERE SCARED.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.001
AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT
THAT'S THE WAY

16:42.001 --> 16:43.633
THINGS WERE SUPPOSED TO BE.

16:43.633 --> 16:45.435
WE WERE
SUPPOSED TO BE TOGETHER,

16:45.435 --> 16:47.607
HAVE OUR ENTIRE LIVES
TOGETHER.

16:47.607 --> 16:50.180
SO I CAN'T JUST SIT BACK
AND BE OKAY WITH YOU LOSING

16:50.180 --> 16:53.213
THE ONE THING THAT CAN GET ME
MY 30 YEARS WITH YOU.

16:53.213 --> 16:54.544
(sighs)

16:54.544 --> 16:56.546
I'M SORRY.

16:56.546 --> 16:59.149
HE'S JUST A LITTLE SCARED.

16:59.149 --> 17:02.092
YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT I AM.

17:02.092 --> 17:04.254
YOU DON'T SCREW THIS UP.

17:04.254 --> 17:05.555
WE WON'T.

17:05.555 --> 17:08.098
DR. ROSS, YOU'LL MAKE SURE
THAT THE LIVER GETS HERE?

17:08.098 --> 17:10.430
IF I HAVE TO DRIVE TO OREGON
AND PICK IT UP MYSELF.

17:10.430 --> 17:14.064
SEE? MAYBE THAT'S WHY I HAD TO
SAY THINGS HAPPEN FOR A REASON,

17:14.064 --> 17:15.365
SO YOU'D YELL AT THEM.

17:18.408 --> 17:20.210
GOOD NEWS.
YOUR SCANS CAME BACK CLEAN.

17:20.210 --> 17:21.571
SO YOU'RE FREE TO GO HOME.

17:21.571 --> 17:24.414
OH, THANK GOD.
YOU GOT LUCKY THIS TIME.

17:24.414 --> 17:26.246
THE NEXT LADY IN THE MALL
MIGHT HAVE A GUN.

17:26.246 --> 17:27.577
AND SO DR. WILSON
CAN ASSIST YOU

17:27.577 --> 17:29.119
WITH ANY OTHER QUESTIONS
THAT YOU MAY HAVE,

17:29.119 --> 17:30.380
AND I WILL WRITE YOU
THE PRESCRIPTION

17:30.380 --> 17:31.551
FOR THE PAINKILLERS--OH!

17:31.551 --> 17:32.722
(elevator bell dings)
NICE.

17:32.722 --> 17:34.354
THAT'S ENOUGH!

17:34.354 --> 17:36.186
I AM ALL YOU'VE GOT LEFT, DAD.
AND I'M DONE.

17:36.186 --> 17:38.288
YOU SIT AROUND AND MOPE
ABOUT HOW MOM LEFT YOU,

17:38.288 --> 17:39.429
BUT OF COURSE SHE DID.

17:39.429 --> 17:41.461
YOU'D BE CRAZY
TO STAY MARRIED TO YOU.

17:41.461 --> 17:43.263
HOW LONG HAS THIS BEEN
GOING ON, THE TOUCHING?

17:43.263 --> 17:44.434
I DON'T KNOW.

17:44.434 --> 17:46.136
MY MOM LEFT HIM, LIKE,
TWO YEARS AGO,

17:46.136 --> 17:47.737
BUT IT WAS AT LEAST
A YEAR BEFORE THAT.

17:47.737 --> 17:49.269
AND BEFORE THAT?

17:49.269 --> 17:50.400
HE WAS... NORMAL.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.372
HE WAS MY DAD.

17:52.372 --> 17:54.244
DR. GREY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

17:54.244 --> 17:56.646
EXCUSE ME FOR A SECOND.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.410
DID YOU SEE THE WAY
HE WAS GRABBING MY PEN?

18:00.410 --> 18:02.382
MM-HMM.
THAT'S A GRASPING REFLEX.

18:02.382 --> 18:03.413
IT'S A FRONTAL RELEASE SIGN.

18:03.413 --> 18:05.385
I THOUGHT THAT WENT AWAY
AFTER INFANCY.

18:05.385 --> 18:07.357
WELL, IT DOES UNLESS YOU HAVE
A TUMOR IN YOUR FRONTAL LOBE,

18:07.357 --> 18:09.259
IN WHICH CASE,
PRIMITIVE REFLEXES COME BACK

18:09.259 --> 18:10.860
ALONG WITH DISINHIBITION.

18:10.860 --> 18:12.222
PATIENTS
START BECOMING IMPULSIVE,

18:12.222 --> 18:13.263
SAYING THINGS THEY SHOULDN'T.

18:13.263 --> 18:14.694
GRABBING ASS.
YOU'RE SO SMART.

18:14.694 --> 18:15.865
STOP SUCKING UP.

18:15.865 --> 18:18.428
GO GET A C.T. AND PAGE NEURO.

18:18.428 --> 18:20.430
(sighs)

18:20.430 --> 18:21.771
OH, HEY.

18:21.771 --> 18:23.303
OH, I'M ABOUT TO HEAD BACK
INTO MY MEETING.

18:23.303 --> 18:25.135
UM, BAILEY AND I ARE DOING
THE HEART-LIVER SURGERY TODAY.

18:25.135 --> 18:26.436
I-I-I'M LEAD CARDIO ON IT,

18:26.436 --> 18:28.308
AND, UH, RUSSELL WANTED YOU
TO SIGN OFF ON IT.

18:28.308 --> 18:29.679
OKAY. THAT ALL?

18:29.679 --> 18:31.411
NO. WHY AM I HERE?

18:31.411 --> 18:33.683
WHAT?
YOU PUSHED TO HAVE ME BACK.

18:33.683 --> 18:36.386
I AM CURIOUS WHY, BECAUSE YOU
DON'T SEEM TO WANT ME HERE.

18:36.386 --> 18:37.447
OH, YOU'RE GONNA DO
GREAT THINGS, CRISTINA,

18:37.447 --> 18:38.718
AND I'M RUNNING A HOSPITAL.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.420
I'D RATHER HAVE YOU DO THAT
UNDER OUR BANNER.

18:40.420 --> 18:41.551
YOU'RE GOOD BUSINESS.

18:41.551 --> 18:43.593
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON?

18:43.593 --> 18:46.426
(people speaking indistinctly)

18:46.426 --> 18:47.897
YOU MOVED AWAY.

18:47.897 --> 18:49.259
YOU ASKED ME
TO STOP CALLING YOU.

18:49.259 --> 18:50.300
NOW YOU'RE BACK.
WHAT--WHAT DO YOU WANT?

18:50.300 --> 18:51.901
I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW.
THAT'S--

18:51.901 --> 18:53.463
WELL, LET ME TELL YOU
WHAT WE DO KNOW.

18:53.463 --> 18:55.134
WE WANT DIFFERENT THINGS.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.266
EVERY TIME
WE TRY TO IGNORE THAT,

18:56.266 --> 18:57.367
WE END UP HURTING EACH OTHER.

18:57.367 --> 18:59.309
WE DON'T WORK.

18:59.309 --> 19:01.311
THAT'S WHAT WE KNOW.

19:01.311 --> 19:02.642
AND THAT HASN'T CHANGED.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.774
NOTHING'S CHANGED AT ALL.
I HAVE TO GO BACK TO MY MEETING.

19:07.347 --> 19:09.349
THE BROCHURE HAS A PICTURE
OF THE PLACE

19:09.349 --> 19:11.551
DECORATED WITH ICICLE LIGHTS...
MM.

19:11.551 --> 19:13.353
AND THOSE REINDEER
MADE OUT OF TWIGS.

19:13.353 --> 19:14.524
(gasps)

19:14.524 --> 19:16.326
THAT'S GROSS.

19:16.326 --> 19:19.389
OOH, WHAT ABOUT
A CUPCAKE TOWER

19:19.389 --> 19:20.360
INSTEAD OF A CAKE?

19:20.360 --> 19:21.491
YOU COULD DO
RED AND GREEN FROSTING.

19:21.491 --> 19:23.233
(elevator bell dings)

19:23.233 --> 19:24.364
OH, COME ON.

19:24.364 --> 19:26.336
YOU GUYS ARE IN LOVE.
WHY NOT CELEBRATE THAT?

19:26.336 --> 19:28.798
'CAUSE SOMETIMES LOVE
MAKES YOU DO STUPID THINGS.

19:28.798 --> 19:30.500
SUDDENLY YOU'RE SCREWED
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

19:30.500 --> 19:31.671
WHAT HE SAID.

19:31.671 --> 19:33.203
WHY ARE YOU EVEN TALKING?

19:33.203 --> 19:34.504
I NEED THAT ANSWER ABOUT
THE RADIAL NERVE TRANSFER.

19:34.504 --> 19:36.846
YEAH. SLOW READER HERE.
MM.

19:36.846 --> 19:38.208
HEY.
HEY.

19:38.208 --> 19:39.509
OH, ARIZONA.

19:39.509 --> 19:41.681
HEY, DR. ROBBINS. UH, YOU'RE
WORKING WITH HORSE KID, RIGHT?

19:41.681 --> 19:43.283
UH, YEAH, I AM.
KAREV'S GOT HIM IN PRE-OP.

19:43.283 --> 19:46.286
AND DR. KEPNER, WAS SHE ALSO
IN PRE-OP OR IS SHE PROBABLY--

19:46.286 --> 19:47.717
EXCUSE ME. WHY WOULD SHE KNOW
WHERE YOUR GIRLFRIEND IS?

19:47.717 --> 19:49.259
READ THE ARTICLE.

19:49.259 --> 19:50.490
HEY, UM, I'M GONNA DO
AN EXPLORATORY LAP

19:50.490 --> 19:52.222
ON THIS KID TONIGHT, SO I
MIGHT BE HOME A LITTLE LATE.

19:52.222 --> 19:54.394
YOU'RE DOING EXPLORATORY SURGERY
YOUR FIRST DAY BACK?

19:54.394 --> 19:56.696
THAT'S A LOT OF STANDING.
YOU THINK THAT...
(mutters)

19:56.696 --> 19:58.197
YOU MIGHT GET BORED?

19:58.197 --> 20:00.830
'CAUSE I GET BORED
JUST STANDING.

20:00.830 --> 20:03.273
AND SITTING--I ALSO
GET BORED SITTING.

20:03.273 --> 20:05.305
HEY. UH, BAILEY AND BEN
ARE HAVING A CHRISTMAS WEDDING.

20:05.305 --> 20:06.506
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE CAROLERS.

20:06.506 --> 20:07.637
OH, I LOVE CHRISTMAS CAROLERS.

20:07.637 --> 20:09.479
THERE WILL
NO CAROLERS.

20:09.479 --> 20:11.311
(cell phone chimes)

20:11.311 --> 20:13.313
(Callie laughs)

20:13.313 --> 20:14.414
TORRES, I'M GONNA BE
RIGHT BACK.

20:14.414 --> 20:15.715
NO, NO, NO.
I NEED YOU HERE.

20:15.715 --> 20:16.886
(door closes)

20:16.886 --> 20:18.548
(chuckles)

20:18.548 --> 20:19.619
JACKSON.

20:19.619 --> 20:21.451
SORRY. I THOUGHT
YOU WERE...

20:21.451 --> 20:22.922
YOU TWO HAVING A SEX DATE?

20:22.922 --> 20:25.755
WE ARE NOT HAVING A SEX DATE.
NOT EVERYTHING IS ABOUT SEX.

20:25.755 --> 20:27.557
YOU OKAY?

20:27.557 --> 20:29.399
YES.

20:29.399 --> 20:31.501
(voice breaks) NO.

20:32.862 --> 20:34.564
(crying) OH, GOD.

20:34.564 --> 20:35.535
APRIL?

20:35.535 --> 20:36.706
I HAD PLAN.

20:36.706 --> 20:39.839
I WAS GONNA BE MARRIED
AND HAVE A HUSBAND.

20:39.839 --> 20:42.472
OUR WEDDING WOULD HAVE
THE--THE MINTS.

20:42.472 --> 20:46.346
WE'D BE...
"MINT TO BE," COMMITTED.

20:46.346 --> 20:48.348
I WAS GONNA TELL MY HUSBAND
THAT I WAS PREGNANT

20:48.348 --> 20:52.251
BY GIVING HIM A T-SHIRT THAT
SAID "WORLD'S GREATEST DAD."

20:52.251 --> 20:53.523
NOW LOOK AT ME.

20:53.523 --> 20:55.725
YOU'RE PREGNANT?

20:55.725 --> 20:57.487
I THINK SO.

20:57.487 --> 20:59.759
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

21:01.260 --> 21:02.592
PLANS NEVER WORK OUT

21:02.592 --> 21:03.893
THE WAY YOU THINK
THEY'RE GOING TO,

21:03.893 --> 21:05.435
ESPECIALLY WITH BABIES.

21:05.435 --> 21:07.537
YOU TRY AND TRY
TO GET PREGNANT, AND YOU CAN'T.

21:07.537 --> 21:09.399
AND THEN A BABY COMES
WHEN YOU LEAST EXPECT IT,

21:09.399 --> 21:11.371
PROBABLY BECAUSE
YOU DIDN'T PLAN IT.

21:11.371 --> 21:13.272
PLANS DON'T MEAN ANYTHING.

21:13.272 --> 21:15.044
(Jackson) HEY.

21:15.044 --> 21:18.448
I WAS JUST LEAVING.

21:18.448 --> 21:19.609
(door opens)

21:19.609 --> 21:20.750
(mouths words)

21:20.750 --> 21:22.512
(man)
TELL US ABOUT YOUR DECISION

21:22.512 --> 21:24.854
IN USING SKYTRIP EXPRESS
AS THE CHARTER COMPANY.

21:24.854 --> 21:26.015
IT WASN'T MY DECISION.

21:26.015 --> 21:28.057
THE HOSPITAL HAS A DEAL
WITH THAT COMPANY.

21:28.057 --> 21:30.019
HAS THE HOSPITAL
ALWAYS USED THAT COMPANY?

21:30.019 --> 21:31.521
I HAVE NO IDEA.

21:31.521 --> 21:34.624
WERE YOU AWARE THAT SKYTRIP HAD
A HISTORY OF MECHANICAL ISSUES?

21:34.624 --> 21:35.765
WHAT?

21:35.765 --> 21:37.927
F.A.A. REPORTS 4 INCIDENTS
SINCE JULY 2010.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.602
NO, I DIDN'T.
OF COURSE I DIDN'T.

21:42.602 --> 21:43.903
YOU DON'T REMEMBER
SWITCHING TO SKYTRIP

21:43.903 --> 21:45.875
FROM ANOTHER CHARTER COMPANY
LAST DECEMBER?

21:45.875 --> 21:47.637
I'M NOT...

21:47.637 --> 21:49.339
I'M--I WASN'T AWARE OF THAT.

21:49.339 --> 21:51.611
I-I RUN A SURGICAL STAFF.
I'M NOT A--

21:51.611 --> 21:53.783
IN A ROUND OF BUDGET CUTS
HEADING INTO FISCAL 2012,

21:53.783 --> 21:56.315
TRANSPORTATION POLICY SHIFTED

21:56.315 --> 21:58.788
FROM YOUR PREVIOUS COMPANY
TO SKYTRIP,

21:58.788 --> 22:01.951
WHO IT APPEARS SUBCONTRACTS
TO SEVERAL SMALLER COMPANIES--

22:01.951 --> 22:03.593
WHO HAD MECHANICAL ISSUES.

22:03.593 --> 22:04.754
THAT'S RIGHT.

22:04.754 --> 22:05.925
(scoffs)

22:05.925 --> 22:07.357
THIS IS HOW WE SAVE MONEY,

22:07.357 --> 22:08.928
BY JEOPARDIZING
OUR PEOPLE'S LIVES?

22:08.928 --> 22:10.360
WHO ARE VETTING THESE GUYS?

22:10.360 --> 22:11.831
WHO APPROVED
SWITCHING TO A COMPANY

22:11.831 --> 22:13.803
WITHOUT CHECKING
THEIR DAMN SAFETY RECORDS?

22:13.803 --> 22:16.666
IS THIS YOUR SIGNATURE,
DR. HUNT?

22:16.666 --> 22:19.669
(siren wailing)

22:32.051 --> 22:33.723
I DON'T REMEMBER THIS
SPECIFICALLY,

22:33.723 --> 22:35.685
BUT...

22:35.685 --> 22:37.387
YES.

22:37.387 --> 22:40.530
YES, I APPROVED THIS.
I...

22:40.530 --> 22:42.532
(sighs) I DID IT.

22:44.063 --> 22:45.995
SO WHAT HAPPENS NOW,
I RESIGN?

22:45.995 --> 22:47.867
THIS INTERVIEW
IS JUST TO ASCERTAIN--

22:47.867 --> 22:49.939
THAT IS THE LAST THING
THAT WE WANT.

22:49.939 --> 22:53.042
I'M SORRY. CAN I INTERJECT
SOMETHING HERE, OFF THE RECORD?

22:53.042 --> 22:55.044
DR. HUNT,
I AM ROBERTA THOMPSON.

22:55.044 --> 22:56.876
I AM NEW TO THE BOARD.

22:56.876 --> 22:58.077
YEAH, WE'VE MET.

22:58.077 --> 22:59.449
RIGHT.

22:59.449 --> 23:01.481
UM, I JUST WANT
TO BE CLEAR HERE.

23:01.481 --> 23:02.812
YOU SAID IT YOURSELF.

23:02.812 --> 23:04.584
YOU RUN A SURGICAL STAFF,

23:04.584 --> 23:06.786
AND YOU DO
A HELL OF A JOB AT IT.

23:06.786 --> 23:08.458
YOU WOULDN'T DO IT SO WELL
IF WE EXPECTED YOU

23:08.458 --> 23:10.660
TO CHASE DOWN EVERY ZERO
ON A BUDGET REPORT.

23:11.921 --> 23:15.625
OWEN...
A MISTAKE WAS MADE...

23:15.625 --> 23:17.066
AN OVERSIGHT,

23:17.066 --> 23:19.128
AND IT COST US,
ALL OF US.

23:19.128 --> 23:20.830
GOD KNOWS
IT COST OUR DOCTORS.

23:20.830 --> 23:24.133
AND YOU, YOUR OWN WIFE HAS
PAID A TERRIBLE PRICE FOR THIS,

23:24.133 --> 23:25.635
BUT THE BOARD
WANTS YOU TO KNOW

23:25.635 --> 23:28.538
THAT YOU HAVE
OUR FULL SUPPORT IN THIS.

23:32.442 --> 23:34.083
YOU OKAY?

23:34.083 --> 23:36.486
YEAH.

23:36.486 --> 23:37.917
YOU?

23:37.917 --> 23:40.450
YEAH.

23:40.450 --> 23:41.821
I DON'T KNOW.

23:41.821 --> 23:44.524
I KNOW.

23:44.524 --> 23:46.456
I GUESS I SHOULD'VE BEEN
ON THE PILL.

23:46.456 --> 23:48.498
YEAH, I GUESS WE WERE
BOTH PRETTY STUPID.

23:52.602 --> 23:55.164
JACKSON, I CAN DO THIS MYSELF,
YOU KNOW?

23:55.164 --> 23:56.536
WHAT?

23:56.536 --> 23:58.167
JUST, IF THIS ISN'T
WHAT YOU WANT...
WHY--

23:58.167 --> 24:00.069
WHAT THE HELL, KEPNER?
OUR SURGERY'S ABOUT TO START.

24:00.069 --> 24:01.941
I'M ANEMIC.
S.T.D. SCREEN.

24:01.941 --> 24:03.773
(elevator bell dings)
GREAT TIMING, THOUGH,
'CAUSE I JUST FINISHED.

24:03.773 --> 24:05.475
AND CAN YOU GET THAT?
PERF--THANK YOU.

24:05.475 --> 24:06.616
YEAH.

24:06.616 --> 24:08.678
ALL RIGHTY. AND SEE YA.

24:08.678 --> 24:11.551
(people speak indistinctly)

24:11.551 --> 24:13.583
(door closes)

24:13.583 --> 24:15.555
(sighs)

24:15.555 --> 24:16.786
(suction gurgling)

24:16.786 --> 24:18.788
DR. BAILEY.

24:18.788 --> 24:20.229
HEY. WE'RE ALMOST
READY FOR YOU.

24:20.229 --> 24:23.192
AFTER THIS BILE DUCT,
WE'LL BE JUST ABOUT DONE.

24:23.192 --> 24:25.034
DR. BAILEY, DR. WARREN'S
CALLING THE FRONT DESK.

24:25.034 --> 24:26.696
HE WAS WONDERING WHAT TIME
YOUR SURGERY WOULD BE DONE.

24:26.696 --> 24:28.538
YEAH, I BET HE IS.

24:28.538 --> 24:30.540
HE PROBABLY FOUND ANOTHER
INSPIRATION PICTURE

24:30.540 --> 24:33.472
IN A BRIDE MAGAZINE
HE WANTS TO DISCUSS.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.705
DO WE DO SILVER BELLS
OR SNOWFLAKES

24:35.705 --> 24:37.577
ON OUR INVITATION?

24:37.577 --> 24:39.909
GARLAND OR POINSETTIAS
ON THE CENTERPIECE?

24:39.909 --> 24:41.581
PSH. UH, SUCTION.

24:41.581 --> 24:42.481
IT'S JUST A WEDDING.

24:42.481 --> 24:43.813
(elevator bell dings)

24:43.813 --> 24:44.984
OH, COME ON.

24:44.984 --> 24:46.516
OUT OF ALL PEOPLE, I THOUGHT

24:46.516 --> 24:48.487
I COULD COUNT ON YOU
TO HAVE MY BACK.

24:48.487 --> 24:49.859
DO YOU THINK I WANTED THAT
WEDDING AT MEREDITH'S HOUSE?

24:49.859 --> 24:51.160
THAT WAS FOR OWEN.

24:51.160 --> 24:53.062
PUT ON THE DRESS.
THERE ARE BIGGER BATTLES.

24:53.062 --> 24:54.594
RIGHT, 'CAUSE THAT PHILOSOPHY

24:54.594 --> 24:56.896
WORKED OUT SO WELL FOR YOU
AND OWEN. T-TUBE.

24:56.896 --> 24:58.668
(woman) HERE YOU GO.

24:58.668 --> 25:00.900
(April) UGH!

25:00.900 --> 25:02.131
DR. KEPNER?

25:02.131 --> 25:04.003
SORRY, THIS P.D.S. SUTURE
ISN'T HOLDING,

25:04.003 --> 25:06.005
AND I CAN'T GET HEMOSTASIS.

25:06.005 --> 25:07.877
(sighs) HORSEBACK RIDING
IS SUPPOSED TO BE FUN,

25:07.877 --> 25:09.679
BUT EVEN IF YOU WEAR
THE RIGHT SHOES

25:09.679 --> 25:11.541
AND A HELMET AND EVERYTHING,
PROTECTION DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK.

25:11.541 --> 25:12.511
SO YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHAT'S THE POINT?

25:12.511 --> 25:13.813
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
JUST RIDE BAREBACK.

25:13.813 --> 25:15.184
KAREV, CAN YOU
TAKE THIS OVER FOR A SECOND?

25:15.184 --> 25:16.716
YEAH, SURE.

25:16.716 --> 25:20.219
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

25:20.219 --> 25:21.991
OHH.

25:21.991 --> 25:24.694
(wheels squeak)

25:24.694 --> 25:28.598
(squeaking)

25:28.598 --> 25:30.259
YOU,
WHATEVER YOUR NAME IS,

25:30.259 --> 25:32.261
CAN YOU STOP STALKING ME
WITH CHAIRS?

25:32.261 --> 25:34.263
I-I'M STRETCHING,
WHICH IS NORMAL.

25:34.263 --> 25:36.165
W-WE ALL NEED
TO STRETCH SOMETIMES.

25:36.165 --> 25:37.637
SO CAN YOU JUST GET
THAT THING AWAY FROM ME?

25:40.570 --> 25:44.844
(squeaks)

25:46.015 --> 25:47.176
PICKUPS.

25:47.176 --> 25:48.718
(woman) HERE YOU GO.

25:49.949 --> 25:52.652
(people speaking indistinctly)

25:52.652 --> 25:55.554
YOU WERE RIGHT. IT'S A TUMOR.
MOVE.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.587
(beeping)
BUT THIS NEURO GUY SAYS
IT'S TOO FAR ALONG TO OPERATE,

25:57.587 --> 25:59.689
SO THEY'RE JUST GONNA
SEND HIM HOME.

25:59.689 --> 26:00.860
SHE SPENT ALL THESE YEARS

26:00.860 --> 26:02.662
THINKING HE WAS JUST
A DIRTY OLD MAN,

26:02.662 --> 26:04.664
AND NOW SHE KNOWS
IT'S A TUMOR

26:04.664 --> 26:08.067
AND THAT'S NOT WHO HE IS,
IT'S TOO LATE, AND...

26:08.067 --> 26:10.670
I'M TALKING TO MYSELF.

26:10.670 --> 26:12.171
(elevator bell dings)

26:12.171 --> 26:14.273
DR. YANG, I'M ALMOST
FINISHED HERE.

26:14.273 --> 26:16.746
YOU CAN GET READY
TO CLOSE THE STERNUM.

26:16.746 --> 26:19.208
BOKI, I THINK DR. YANG
PREFERS STERNAL CABLES,

26:19.208 --> 26:21.681
NOT MONOFILAMENT WIRE.

26:21.681 --> 26:23.012
DR. EDWARDS, HOW WOULD YOU
LIKE THE HONOR

26:23.012 --> 26:24.583
OF CLOSING FOR ME TODAY?

26:24.583 --> 26:25.955
UH, NO. YOU HEARD ME.

26:25.955 --> 26:27.957
NO INTERNS CLOSING UP
THIS PATIENT.

26:27.957 --> 26:30.620
DR. BAILEY, I MIGHT NOT GIVE
THE BEST WEDDING ADVICE,

26:30.620 --> 26:33.122
BUT THIS IS MY INTERN
UNDER MY SERVICE,

26:33.122 --> 26:34.794
AND SHE'S BEEN PRACTICING
THIS PROCEDURE FOR DAYS.

26:34.794 --> 26:36.726
I AM MORE THAN CONFIDENT
SHE'S PREPARED.

26:36.726 --> 26:39.328
FINE. LET HER CLOSE.

26:39.328 --> 26:41.370
PREPARE THE STERNAL CABLE,
PLEASE, BOKI.

26:41.370 --> 26:44.303
DR. BAILEY, SHOULD THERE BE
THIS MUCH BLEEDING?

26:44.303 --> 26:46.305
OH, HE'S NOT CLOTTING.

26:46.305 --> 26:48.037
UH, LET'S GET SOME F.F.P.
AND FACTOR VII UP HERE.

26:48.037 --> 26:49.909
GET IN THERE
WITH SOME LAP PADS.

26:49.909 --> 26:53.713
WE NEED
TO APPLY PRESSURE QUICK.

26:53.713 --> 26:55.344
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
OKAY, LET'S MAKE SURE

26:55.344 --> 26:56.916
THAT WE CHECK PULSES
EVERY TWO HOURS.

26:56.916 --> 26:58.788
I'M GONNA GO TALK
TO THE PARENTS.

26:58.788 --> 27:00.990
(indistinct conversations)

27:00.990 --> 27:03.392
OH! (grunts)
(objects clatter)

27:03.392 --> 27:06.996
(surgical staff
murmuring indistinctly)

27:06.996 --> 27:08.327
EVERYBODY OUT.

27:08.327 --> 27:09.699
(murmuring continues)

27:09.699 --> 27:11.731
I SAID GET OUT.

27:11.731 --> 27:12.902
(murmuring continues)

27:12.902 --> 27:14.063
(Arizona whimpering)

27:14.063 --> 27:16.666
YOU OKAY?

27:16.666 --> 27:19.408
ROBBINS, ARE YOU HURT?
DID YOU HIT YOUR HEAD?

27:19.408 --> 27:23.172
I WAS--I WAS SO PROUD
OF MYSELF...

27:23.172 --> 27:25.715
FOR GETTING THROUGH TODAY

27:25.715 --> 27:27.176
AND THE SURGERY,

27:27.176 --> 27:28.678
LIKE NOTHING WAS DIFFERENT,

27:28.678 --> 27:30.319
AND I'M SUCH A BIG SHOT

27:30.319 --> 27:32.782
THAT I WENT AND PUT
ALL MY WEIGHT ON MY LEFT FOOT,

27:32.782 --> 27:36.185
EXCEPT... (laughing)

27:36.185 --> 27:39.158
I DON'T HAVE A LEFT FOOT.

27:39.158 --> 27:41.190
AND NOW I'M ON MY ASS.

27:41.190 --> 27:44.193
AND YOU SHOULD--YOU SHOULD
SEE THE LOOK ON YOUR FACE.

27:44.193 --> 27:45.735
(continues laughing)

27:45.735 --> 27:46.866
(laughs)

27:46.866 --> 27:49.799
OH, ARE YOU GONNA--
ARE YOU GONNA HELP ME UP?

27:49.799 --> 27:51.170
YEAH. COME ON.

27:53.803 --> 27:54.944
OHH.

27:54.944 --> 27:56.145
COME ON.

27:56.145 --> 27:57.707
(chuckles)

28:02.011 --> 28:03.182
HOW'S THE BLEEDING?

28:03.182 --> 28:04.153
STILL WON'T STOP.

28:04.153 --> 28:05.785
CAN WE TRY MORE R.B.C.s?

28:05.785 --> 28:07.116
THAT'LL JUST OVERLOAD HIM.
WHAT'S HIS LACTATE LEVEL?

28:07.116 --> 28:09.759
IT'S GONE FROM 9 TO 17
IN THE LAST 30 MINUTES.

28:09.759 --> 28:11.690
NO.
(suction gurgling)

28:11.690 --> 28:14.323
OH, COME ON. NO. NO.

28:14.323 --> 28:16.726
OH, DAMN IT.

28:16.726 --> 28:18.167
WHAT IS IT?
WHY'D YOU STOP?

28:18.167 --> 28:20.930
SEE HOW THE LIVER'S PATCHY?

28:20.930 --> 28:22.872
HE'S REJECTING IT?

28:22.872 --> 28:25.074
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

28:25.074 --> 28:28.107
DOES THIS MEAN
I DON'T GET TO CLOSE?

28:28.107 --> 28:30.209
OKAY, SO IF WE DID
A PEDICLE FLAP...
(cell phone chimes)

28:30.209 --> 28:32.281
WE COULD DO A TENDON TRANSFER
TO GET BACK MOTOR FUNCTION.

28:32.281 --> 28:33.913
(people speaking indistinctly)

28:33.913 --> 28:35.785
WHERE ARE YOU?

28:35.785 --> 28:36.946
WHAT?

28:36.946 --> 28:38.117
YOU'VE BEEN STARING
AT YOUR PHONE ALL DAY,

28:38.117 --> 28:39.248
LIKE SOME 16-YEAR-OLD GIRL

28:39.248 --> 28:41.120
WAITING FOR A CREEPY COLLEGE GUY
TO TEXT HER BACK.

28:41.120 --> 28:42.721
I NEED YOU TO FOCUS.

28:42.721 --> 28:43.893
I'M SORRY, OKAY?

28:43.893 --> 28:45.054
BUT WE BOTH KNOW SHEPHERD

28:45.054 --> 28:46.255
IS JUST GONNA
SHOOT THIS THING DOWN.

28:46.255 --> 28:47.957
HE DOESN'T WANT TO DO
THE SURGERY.

28:47.957 --> 28:50.329
OH, HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT
HE WANTS. HE'S JUST SCARED.

28:50.329 --> 28:51.961
HE WISHES THIS NEVER HAPPENED,
BUT IT HAPPENED,

28:51.961 --> 28:54.333
AND NOW IT'S UP TO US
TO COME UP WITH A PLAN

28:54.333 --> 28:56.365
THAT MAKES HIM FEEL
JUST A LITTLE LESS SCARED,

28:56.365 --> 28:58.307
MAKES HIM BELIEVE
IT'LL ALL BE OKAY.

28:58.307 --> 29:00.469
AND WE CAN DO THAT.
SO COME ON.

29:00.469 --> 29:03.212
ARE YOU WITH ME HERE?

29:03.212 --> 29:04.874
I GOTTA GO DO SOMETHING.

29:04.874 --> 29:06.745
WHAT?

29:06.745 --> 29:08.317
(people speaking indistinctly)

29:08.317 --> 29:10.079
HEY. WHAT'S UP?

29:10.079 --> 29:12.251
LOOK AT THIS.

29:13.482 --> 29:16.255
A MESIO-ORBITAL
FRONTAL LOBE TUMOR.

29:16.255 --> 29:17.386
HE'S THE GRABBY GUY.

29:17.386 --> 29:18.928
HE'S A FATHER.

29:18.928 --> 29:20.229
HIS WHOLE FAMILY'S HORRIFIED
TO BE AROUND HIM.

29:20.229 --> 29:21.931
I THOUGHT WE COULD HELP HIM,

29:21.931 --> 29:23.362
BUT CLEMENS SAYS
IT'S INOPERABLE.

29:23.362 --> 29:24.533
NO, IT'S NOT.

29:24.533 --> 29:25.895
I THOUGHT SO.

29:25.895 --> 29:27.236
ALL RIGHT, I'LL PAGE CLEMENS,

29:27.236 --> 29:28.367
LET HIM KNOW
THAT HE'S AN IDIOT,

29:28.367 --> 29:30.069
AND WALK HIM THROUGH
HOW TO DO IT.

29:30.069 --> 29:31.841
DEREK.
YEAH.

29:31.841 --> 29:33.372
HE'S NOT GONNA DO
AS GOOD A JOB AS YOU.

29:33.372 --> 29:34.543
NO, HE'S NOT.

29:34.543 --> 29:36.976
WHICH IS WHY YOU HAVE TO GET
YOUR HAND FIXED.

29:39.949 --> 29:42.411
(indistinct conversations)

29:42.411 --> 29:44.413
(lowered voice) I DON'T--
I DON'T HAVE THE RESULTS YET.

29:44.413 --> 29:45.955
I TOLD YOU I WOULD TEXT YOU.

29:45.955 --> 29:47.857
I'M IN. ALL THE WAY.

29:47.857 --> 29:49.018
WHAT?

29:49.018 --> 29:50.189
COME ON.

29:55.224 --> 29:57.897
I KNOW IT MIGHT NOT BE
WHAT YOU PLANNED
