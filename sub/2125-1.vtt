* Lead me gently home Father

01:41.267 --> 01:45.367
* Lead me gently home

01:48.767 --> 01:50.967
Dial A Prayer, this is Jeff.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.867
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.

01:53.900 --> 01:55.533
I'll put you on hold and get

01:55.567 --> 01:56.467
right back to you.

01:56.500 --> 01:57.633
Hello, Eileen?

01:57.667 --> 01:58.933
I'm so glad you called.

01:58.967 --> 02:01.133
Yes, He answers all of your

02:01.167 --> 02:02.867
prayers in His own way.

02:02.900 --> 02:05.033
But remember, with God,

02:05.067 --> 02:06.967
all things are possible.

02:07.000 --> 02:11.833
* Lead me gently home

02:11.867 --> 02:17.033
* Hold me gently
Hold me Father

02:17.067 --> 02:22.100
* Lest I fall
upon the wayside

02:22.133 --> 02:27.567
* Lead me gently home

02:27.600 --> 02:30.233
Dial-a-Prayer, how may
I pray for you today?

02:30.267 --> 02:33.133
OLDER MAN
Oh, such a discomfort.

02:33.167 --> 02:34.600
Can anyone help me?

02:34.633 --> 02:36.767
Mm-hm, praise God.

02:36.800 --> 02:38.633
Um, how may I pray
for you today?

02:38.667 --> 02:41.000
OLDER MAN
This rash, can't you stop

02:41.033 --> 02:42.100
the itching?

02:42.133 --> 02:45.233
Ernest, it's time to wrap it up

02:45.267 --> 02:48.067
Let's see...
you have a rash-- rash.

02:48.100 --> 02:50.400
Um, where is the rash?

02:50.433 --> 02:52.100
OLDER MAN OVER PHONE)
Well, that's quite private.

02:52.133 --> 02:54.933
No, no, no, I just-- I just
need more information because..

02:54.967 --> 02:58.167
the more specific that we are
with our prayers...

02:58.200 --> 03:02.033
the more that the good Lord
will be willing...

03:02.067 --> 03:06.100
to take your worry into
consideration.

03:06.133 --> 03:08.900
All right, are you ready
to pray with me?

03:09.867 --> 03:10.733
I hear that, I do.

03:10.767 --> 03:12.267
Hello?

03:12.300 --> 03:15.133
Just put your faith
in the power of the Lord...

03:15.167 --> 03:17.533
and you gonna find
those keys, girl.

03:17.567 --> 03:20.667
The Daily Devotional
is offering a free trial...

03:20.700 --> 03:24.733
but after 30 days, you can
continue with a donation

03:24.767 --> 03:25.733
arrangement.

03:25.767 --> 03:27.800
What was that?

03:27.833 --> 03:31.567
Oh, Sarah,
oh, you are too much.

03:31.600 --> 03:33.667
All righty then, in faith.

03:33.700 --> 03:35.067
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up!
Hold up!

03:35.100 --> 03:38.367
Those are valuable goods.

03:38.400 --> 03:41.767
It's your first day.
It's a lot to take in, I know.

03:41.800 --> 03:44.867
Believe me, I have seen a lot
of people crumble under

03:44.900 --> 03:46.067
the pressure to serve.

03:46.100 --> 03:48.900
But you look solid.

03:48.933 --> 03:50.900
Solid?
Yeah.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.100
Coffee break!

03:56.700 --> 04:01.333
This lady called the other day,
and, you know, kept crying

04:01.367 --> 04:02.367
and crying and--

04:02.400 --> 04:05.167
That guy called today, too,
he started crying.

04:05.200 --> 04:07.267
I was just like,
"You gotta keep the faith."

04:07.300 --> 04:09.100
You think there's any way
I could go out and have a--

04:09.133 --> 04:10.467
Good morning, everyone!

04:10.500 --> 04:13.433
Good morning, Bill!
Beautiful, beautiful day.

04:13.467 --> 04:14.833
Isn't it?
Yes!

04:14.867 --> 04:19.333
Oh, Serena Belle, did you bring
your iced lemon cake again?

04:19.367 --> 04:20.200
Mm-hm.

04:20.233 --> 04:22.167
We deserve our breaks.

04:22.200 --> 04:24.667
And how blessed we are to be
sharing the good Lord's work...

04:24.700 --> 04:28.367
with the many, many callers
who are reaching out to us.

04:28.400 --> 04:31.367
Another record week!
Yay! Whoo!

04:31.400 --> 04:35.367
And! And! Repeat callers
for Georgia...

04:35.400 --> 04:37.867
Marlene!

04:37.900 --> 04:40.067
For Serena Belle!
Yes!

04:40.100 --> 04:43.933
That room, this building,
these four walls...

04:43.967 --> 04:46.233
and the many walled cubicles...

04:46.267 --> 04:50.633
this space-- this space
is truly a special space.

04:50.667 --> 04:54.100
And the work you do, redeems
you in the eyes of the Lord.

04:54.133 --> 04:57.200
This you must know
and feel in your heart.

04:57.233 --> 05:00.500
You are all truly serving
the master.

05:00.533 --> 05:01.600
We are, amen.

05:01.633 --> 05:03.433
God, not me.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.500
Dear Heavenly Father,
bless this day.

05:09.533 --> 05:12.433
Let us serve you and your
word in all its glory.

05:12.467 --> 05:14.533
Amen.
Amen.

05:14.567 --> 05:16.800
All right, let's get to work,
and by that, I mean,

05:16.833 --> 05:17.633
let's talk turkey.

05:17.667 --> 05:19.333
Pun intended.

05:19.367 --> 05:22.567
We are fast coming upon the
great Thanksgiving holiday...

05:22.600 --> 05:23.967
and you know what that means.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.133
A whole lot of need.

05:26.167 --> 05:28.333
You mean, we're gonna be
more busy than usual?

05:28.367 --> 05:30.133
Oh, honey, you haven't seen
such

05:30.167 --> 05:31.700
need as the holiday, precious.

05:31.733 --> 05:36.167
Indeed, indeed, but now, now
is the time to answer the call.

05:36.200 --> 05:38.067
We will not slow down.
No.

05:38.100 --> 05:40.533
We will not leave a caller
holding on the line.

05:40.567 --> 05:41.800
Mm-mm, no.

05:41.833 --> 05:45.267
We will push through,
we will send out that prayer.

05:45.300 --> 05:48.200
We are special, and the work we
do is special.

05:48.233 --> 05:50.100
And it matters.
Hallelujah.

05:50.133 --> 05:52.333
Each and every one
of you matters.

05:52.367 --> 05:53.233
Yes!

05:53.267 --> 05:54.800
Because we're here.
Yes!

05:54.833 --> 05:57.000
Waiting with open arms.
Yes!

05:57.033 --> 05:58.367
With open ears!
Yes!

05:58.400 --> 06:00.900
And with open hearts,
send it up!

06:00.933 --> 06:03.700
With open hearts,
thank you, God! Thank you.

06:03.733 --> 06:05.000
- Amen.
- Praise God.

06:05.033 --> 06:07.000
Oh, look, our new recruit.

06:07.033 --> 06:10.167
Welcome, Cora... welcome.

06:16.300 --> 06:20.800
And now, I have to ask you
a very serious question.

06:20.833 --> 06:24.100
How's your serve?

06:24.133 --> 06:28.967
Reigning champs, LCSD Indoor
Beach Volleyball League.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.033
Whoo!

06:30.067 --> 06:32.333
Huh? Welcome, playa!

06:32.367 --> 06:34.767
I don't really do sports.

06:34.800 --> 06:37.667
Oh! She doesn't really
do sports.

06:37.700 --> 06:39.200
What do we say to that, team?

06:39.233 --> 06:44.033
If you can answer the call,
you better pop that ball!

06:44.067 --> 06:47.000
Welcome, welcome to the fold.

06:47.033 --> 06:49.200
All right, it is time.

06:49.233 --> 06:52.633
Let's go do some good.
Good work, everybody.

06:52.667 --> 06:56.900
Don't tell my wife, but I'm
taking a piece of this cake.

06:56.933 --> 06:58.400
It's not gonna eat itself.

06:58.433 --> 07:00.400
No, it's not.
Let's do some work, folks.

07:00.433 --> 07:03.133
Let's go. It's a sin to waste.

07:09.400 --> 07:12.133
My name is Siobhan, and I'll

07:12.167 --> 07:14.167
help you through this, sir.

07:14.200 --> 07:18.067
The power of prayer
is with you .

07:18.100 --> 07:20.233
Willingly afflict-- we're

07:20.267 --> 07:22.233
created of children and men--

07:22.267 --> 07:27.267
I see my prayers-- look
with pity upon us.

07:27.300 --> 07:28.700
Anything is possible,

07:28.733 --> 07:29.833
Mrs. Lurie.

07:29.867 --> 07:34.033
It is possible with God.
Are you hearing me?

07:35.333 --> 07:38.067
All right, listen
with your whole heart.

07:38.100 --> 07:41.933
Close your eyes,
and let my voice guide you.

08:32.533 --> 08:33.767
Yeah?

08:33.799 --> 08:35.866
You're not getting away
that easy.

08:35.900 --> 08:39.799
I'm sorry.
Tah-dah!

08:39.832 --> 08:41.267
I can't believe I almost--

08:41.299 --> 08:45.233
Well, here,
hope it's not too small.

08:45.267 --> 08:47.700
Wow, it's got my name
on the back and everything.

08:47.733 --> 08:49.033
Oh, yeah.

08:49.067 --> 08:52.100
We're on the
same team now, you know?

08:57.300 --> 08:58.633
Right, um...

08:58.667 --> 09:00.467
well, Bill, I gotta jet.

09:00.500 --> 09:02.000
Godspeed.

09:23.900 --> 09:28.800
* I can't be the one

09:28.833 --> 09:33.167
* Carrying a heart

09:33.200 --> 09:37.367
* That's so heavy

09:37.400 --> 09:42.567
* So heavy

09:48.267 --> 09:53.033
* Safety in ceilings

09:53.067 --> 09:58.533
* Don't need a healing

10:11.400 --> 10:13.933
Well, that's--
that's wonderful, Margaret.

10:13.967 --> 10:17.033
Yeah, yeah, that's--

10:17.067 --> 10:21.033
Margaret, that is fantastic.

10:23.367 --> 10:25.400
Absolutely.

10:29.167 --> 10:30.900
Oh, we are.

10:30.933 --> 10:32.833
We are good, too.

10:32.867 --> 10:36.667
She is, Cora is good.

10:36.700 --> 10:38.967
Yeah, okay, I will.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.300
Absolutely.
See you on the fifth.

10:43.733 --> 10:44.833
Hello, sweetie.

10:44.867 --> 10:47.033
Margaret calling for the dirt.

10:47.067 --> 10:49.633
Is it after 4:00?

10:49.667 --> 10:52.667
I thought it was
so much earlier.

10:52.700 --> 10:54.567
It's 5:00.
Yeah.

10:54.600 --> 10:55.933
Margaret on the phone?

10:55.967 --> 10:58.733
Oh, yeah, right, well,
she's just, um--

10:58.767 --> 11:01.100
You know, she's... bored.

11:01.133 --> 11:03.400
Wondering how we all are doing.

11:03.433 --> 11:06.067
Please tell me you told her
that we're all doing A-okay.

11:06.100 --> 11:08.867
Yeah, of course.

11:08.900 --> 11:11.467
So?

11:11.500 --> 11:12.667
Fine.

11:12.700 --> 11:15.300
And you stayed the whole day?

11:15.333 --> 11:16.900
Yes.

11:16.933 --> 11:20.267
Did anybody give you
a hard time?

11:20.300 --> 11:21.433
Jesus, Mom!

11:21.467 --> 11:22.767
Okay!

11:22.800 --> 11:25.200
Um, your father called...

11:25.233 --> 11:28.867
and he's really behind
with the McCarron deposition.

11:28.900 --> 11:34.000
So he'd probably
be a few more days in--

11:34.033 --> 11:38.067
But he's really looking
forward to seeing you.

11:40.333 --> 11:42.867
Big, deep breath in...

11:42.900 --> 11:45.967
Dial-a-Prayer, how may
I pray for you today?

11:46.000 --> 11:48.100
There it is. All right, good.

11:48.133 --> 11:50.933
All right,
just listen intently. Go.

11:50.967 --> 11:56.233
I just don't have the energy
to keep looking for a new wife.

11:56.267 --> 11:59.167
Well, anything is possible
with God!

11:59.200 --> 12:01.333
Now personalize, personalize!

12:01.367 --> 12:02.433
...Mr. Madison.

12:02.467 --> 12:03.633
There you go.

12:03.667 --> 12:06.167
And, if you're interested
in signing up--

12:06.200 --> 12:08.067
Good, that's great,
now go for it, now!

12:08.100 --> 12:10.967
...then I'd be happy to sign
you up for the morning

12:11.000 --> 12:12.567
meditation.

12:12.600 --> 12:14.667
It's an odd choice, but that's
fine, just keep going.

12:14.700 --> 12:18.767
The morning meditation may
indeed bring you to a closer

12:18.800 --> 12:19.600
place...

12:19.633 --> 12:21.467
with our Lord God in heaven.

12:21.500 --> 12:27.600
Remember, what is done for him
in secret, shall be rewarded

12:27.633 --> 12:28.467
openly!

12:28.500 --> 12:29.800
Nice!

12:29.833 --> 12:33.700
Marlene, such an improvement
from last week's debacle.

12:33.733 --> 12:37.667
Oh, thank you, Siobhan, that
means so much coming from you.

12:37.700 --> 12:41.233
Why do I always have to play
the boring white man?

12:41.267 --> 12:43.733
Okay, Cora, are you ready
to give it a shot?

12:43.767 --> 12:45.767
Jeff, I'd like to phone in.

12:45.800 --> 12:47.600
I've done a little dialogue
work.

12:47.633 --> 12:49.100
Sure thing, yeah!

12:49.133 --> 12:52.700
Looks like we got time
for one more. Here we go.

12:52.733 --> 12:54.867
Good, and... there.

12:54.900 --> 12:58.933
Um, Dial-a-Prayer

12:58.967 --> 13:00.367
Louder.

13:00.400 --> 13:02.533
Cora, how may I pray for you--
A little too much.

13:02.567 --> 13:07.133
I'm lost. I can't find the
strength to get along!

13:07.167 --> 13:09.467
And I think I'm gonna do it!

13:09.500 --> 13:12.167
Um--
I will... today.

13:12.200 --> 13:14.833
Okay, um, well, Miss--
Jeremies.

13:14.867 --> 13:16.933
Don't help her.

13:16.967 --> 13:20.333
Miss Jeremies, maybe
I could offer you a prayer

13:20.367 --> 13:21.433
for protection.

13:21.467 --> 13:22.733
Oh--

13:22.767 --> 13:27.100
No, rather a prayer-- something
from the New Testament.

13:27.133 --> 13:31.300
I'm falling down
into the pit of hell!

13:31.333 --> 13:34.300
My life has no meaning!
Can't you just--

13:34.333 --> 13:36.367
Hang on, code word "can't",
grab on to can't.

13:36.400 --> 13:40.633
Can't-- um, well,
Miss Jeffries, uh...

13:40.667 --> 13:45.100
"can't" is not a word that
exists in the kingdom of heaven

13:45.133 --> 13:50.333
Um, it just doesn't,
so-- uh--

13:50.367 --> 13:55.733
um, I, uh--

13:55.767 --> 13:58.367
Sorry.

13:58.400 --> 14:02.267
That's fine. Okay, everybody,
let's just take a breather,

14:02.300 --> 14:03.267
all right?

14:03.300 --> 14:05.333
We have to get back
on active call duty anyways.

14:05.367 --> 14:11.133
So, uh, Cora,
you take the lunch run.

14:11.167 --> 14:12.633
The lunch run--
Please.

14:12.667 --> 14:15.900
We will try again another
session later in the week.

14:15.933 --> 14:19.167
Does that sound good?

14:32.533 --> 14:33.500
MARY
They are gonna love

14:33.533 --> 14:34.567
you there...

14:34.600 --> 14:36.600
once they figure out
how gifted you are.

14:36.633 --> 14:39.333
I imagine you'll be
promoted or something.

14:39.367 --> 14:41.667
I mean, opportunities come
in the least expected places,

14:41.700 --> 14:42.200
they say.

14:42.233 --> 14:43.600
Mom--

14:43.633 --> 14:46.233
Listen, it's just us
for dinner tonight...

14:46.267 --> 14:48.467
your father is switching planes
in Cleveland or something.

14:48.500 --> 14:53.000
Oh, oh, my other
let me call you back.

15:26.733 --> 15:29.200
Oh... shit.

15:31.933 --> 15:35.633
Cora? Is that you?

15:43.200 --> 15:48.833
Hey. Sorry if I woke you up.
I have the early-riser shift.

15:48.867 --> 15:52.000
Did you just get here?

15:52.033 --> 15:54.167
They said you needed
close monitoring.

15:54.200 --> 16:00.600
Mom! I'm 26 years old,
I'm fine.

16:00.633 --> 16:03.600
And I should-- I should be
going, because I don't want to

16:03.633 --> 16:05.067
get a demerit slip or anything.

16:05.100 --> 16:08.067
You can't afford to make
a single mistake, Cora.

16:10.667 --> 16:13.333
I want you to remember
something.

16:13.367 --> 16:17.133
Every day is a beautiful
beginning.

16:17.167 --> 16:22.767
Thy word is a lamb unto my feet
and a light unto my path.

16:26.967 --> 16:28.767
Have a good day.

16:46.133 --> 16:48.600
All sorts of things
are possible with God...

16:48.633 --> 16:50.567
my name is Siobhan.

16:53.100 --> 16:55.100
I'm gonna pray with you.

16:55.133 --> 16:57.900
Create in me a pure heart,
O God...

16:57.933 --> 17:00.367
in my newest steadfast
spirit with me.

17:00.400 --> 17:03.333
Restore to me the joy of your
salvation and grant me a

17:03.367 --> 17:04.700
willing spirit to sustain me.

17:07.233 --> 17:12.000
And yes, always remember,
in everything, God works good

17:12.032 --> 17:14.099
for those who love Him.

17:14.133 --> 17:17.767
The beauty of your creation,
in earth and sky--

17:17.800 --> 17:21.666
God grant me the serenity
to accept the things I can,

17:21.700 --> 17:22.833
and the wisdom--

17:22.867 --> 17:25.967
For hearts to love,
for hands to serve.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.333
Breathe in faith.
Breathe out fear.

17:28.367 --> 17:31.300
Where there is hatred,
let us sow love.

17:31.333 --> 17:35.667
For all valiant seekers,
after truth, liberty--

17:35.700 --> 17:37.133
Are you there? Speak up.

17:37.167 --> 17:38.833
Now say it with me.

17:38.867 --> 17:39.733
...make us instruments

17:39.767 --> 17:40.400
of thy people.

17:40.433 --> 17:41.600
I remembered you.

17:41.633 --> 17:43.333
Be not frightened...

17:43.367 --> 17:47.367
neither be dismayed,
for the Lord, your God

17:47.400 --> 17:48.500
is with you.

17:48.533 --> 17:49.800
Wherever you go--

17:49.833 --> 17:54.400
Wherever you go--
Wherever you go--

17:57.600 --> 18:00.233
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Cora!
I gotta get out of here!

18:00.267 --> 18:01.667
I'm sorry, we do not make our
own break schedules here.

18:01.700 --> 18:02.833
I-- I am through!

18:02.867 --> 18:05.200
Not to mention that business
with the lunch run

18:05.233 --> 18:06.667
was rather nasty--
I'm through& done!

18:06.700 --> 18:08.933
Serena had to make a run
to Mick D's, of all places.

18:08.967 --> 18:10.367
I can't...
this is bullshit.

18:10.400 --> 18:13.067
I am not cut out
for this bullshit.

18:13.100 --> 18:15.833
I don't deserve to be
in there with those freaks!

18:15.867 --> 18:17.400
All right, that's enough.

18:17.433 --> 18:21.733
Do I really have to remind you
why you're in there?

18:21.767 --> 18:23.500
No.

18:23.533 --> 18:25.667
Now I understand you may
be adjusting...

18:25.700 --> 18:29.700
but this could go very quickly
go from a nice setup to one

18:29.733 --> 18:31.067
that is not so great.

18:31.100 --> 18:34.467
Isn't that true?

18:34.500 --> 18:36.700
The charges against
you were steep.

18:36.733 --> 18:41.000
We petitioned the court, so you
wouldn't have to do jail time.

18:41.033 --> 18:45.667
Jail time. I want you to think
about that, would you?

18:45.700 --> 18:49.300
And I am still meant to answer
to that judge, you know?

18:51.600 --> 18:56.900
Now we are graciously,
so very graciously...

18:56.933 --> 19:00.567
allowing you to repent
for your sin against us,

19:00.600 --> 19:02.533
and Him, and the church.

19:02.567 --> 19:04.900
Are we clear?

19:04.933 --> 19:08.033
Yes, sir.

19:08.067 --> 19:15.400
All right, you go home,
get your head together.

19:15.433 --> 19:17.800
I'm gonna have to dock you for
today's hours and yesterday's,

19:17.833 --> 19:19.333
too, for that matter.

19:19.367 --> 19:25.333
And don't think you can just go
through the motions and get by.

19:25.367 --> 19:28.633
It might do you some
good to actually partake.

19:28.667 --> 19:31.333
Understood?

19:31.367 --> 19:33.067
Yes.

20:48.300 --> 20:50.533
Yes, Mrs. Koehler, I think
that's a great idea...

20:50.567 --> 20:52.467
to commit to a daily devotional
while you work through this

20:52.500 --> 20:53.933
time with your husband.

20:53.967 --> 20:56.133
MRS. KOHLER He
told me he wouldn't do it again

20:56.167 --> 20:57.467
if I gave him a third chance.

20:57.500 --> 20:59.900
Really?

20:59.933 --> 21:02.967
Well, then, I think you should
tell your husband to go to hell

21:03.000 --> 21:07.500
Seriously... Mrs. Koehler?

21:07.533 --> 21:09.133
WOMAN Is there
anyway the check can come

21:09.167 --> 21:10.400
in this week instead of next?

21:10.433 --> 21:14.833
Well, rest assured we will
handle your prayer request

21:14.867 --> 21:15.967
with care.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.533
We are here to offer you
strength and hope...

21:18.567 --> 21:23.267
but you should probably give up
on that check, ma'am.

21:23.300 --> 21:24.967
MAN I just keep
having these thoughts...

21:25.000 --> 21:27.200
these bad thoughts
about other people.

21:27.233 --> 21:31.800
Well, I'm told when you feel
the world growing small...

21:31.833 --> 21:37.267
and yourself great,
read the 19th Psalm.

21:37.300 --> 21:39.900
Yeah, does that even
make sense ?

21:39.933 --> 21:41.100
MAN
The prayer for recovery...

21:41.133 --> 21:42.067
could you do that one, please?

21:42.100 --> 21:44.400
It really made a difference.

21:44.433 --> 21:47.000
Yes, hold, please.

21:47.033 --> 21:50.933
Got it, a prayer for help.

21:50.967 --> 21:51.733
WOMAN
It has to be early admission

21:51.767 --> 21:53.167
otherwise the whole plan--

21:53.200 --> 21:57.067
Wait, wait, that's your SAT
score... and you're worried?

21:57.100 --> 22:01.133
Um, I'll put in the prayer
request, Carrie, but I think

22:01.167 --> 22:02.867
you're gonna be fine.

22:02.900 --> 22:05.733
Keep the faith. Mm-hm.

22:05.767 --> 22:07.400
Hey, hey.

22:07.433 --> 22:09.700
Hey, busy day.

22:09.733 --> 22:11.900
Prayer for strength?

22:11.933 --> 22:13.500
Yeah... what?

22:13.533 --> 22:16.433
Prayer for strength, I heard
you-- I heard you with a

22:16.467 --> 22:17.900
caller--

22:17.933 --> 22:19.933
That daughter's marriage on the
rocks, something like that.

22:19.967 --> 22:21.567
Uh-huh.

22:21.600 --> 22:27.333
And you so clearly stated that
she needed prayer for strength.

22:27.367 --> 22:29.967
And you offered it--
Right.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.567
But you didn't circle it,
you see right here

22:31.600 --> 22:32.933
on the prayer order form?

22:32.967 --> 22:36.900
You circled the 37th Psalm,
Cora, that's like a totally

22:36.933 --> 22:38.033
different area.

22:38.067 --> 22:39.667
Did you realize
that you did that?

22:39.700 --> 22:41.400
That's the opposite just about.

22:41.433 --> 22:45.000
Jeffrey, everyone
has a mix up now and then.

22:45.033 --> 22:46.867
Cora's been with us
just under a month.

22:46.900 --> 22:49.933
No, no. 37th, I'm so sorry.

22:49.967 --> 22:52.700
I must not have had
enough coffee.

22:52.733 --> 22:54.333
Thanks, Jeff.

22:57.967 --> 22:59.600
Jesus.

22:59.633 --> 23:01.300
Finding your groove?

23:01.333 --> 23:05.133
This is about as ungroovy
as you can get.

23:05.167 --> 23:07.300
I don't know, I guess--

23:07.333 --> 23:09.433
Answering the phone
is half of it.

23:09.467 --> 23:13.300
I mean, don't quote me,
but most of these people

23:13.333 --> 23:15.800
just want to be listened to.

23:15.833 --> 23:17.733
If only it were that simple.

23:17.767 --> 23:21.200
Well, I don't know,
maybe it is.

23:21.233 --> 23:23.433
And don't worry about Jeff.

23:23.467 --> 23:25.800
If he doesn't have one issue
a day to get overly anxious

23:25.833 --> 23:26.967
about, it's not a day.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.633
It's a bit of an understatement
I'd say.

23:31.933 --> 23:35.633
Um, do you think I could go out
the side and go for a quick cig

23:35.667 --> 23:39.500
It's Thursday, Bill's at judo.
Go for it.

23:39.533 --> 23:41.000
Thanks.

23:41.033 --> 23:42.767
Be back in ten.

24:05.567 --> 24:08.000
Hi, excuse me.

24:09.700 --> 24:11.200
Hi.

24:11.233 --> 24:13.900
Uh, I don't know
if I'm in the right place.

24:13.933 --> 24:17.200
Are you looking for Bill?

24:17.233 --> 24:19.533
Do you start today
or something?

24:21.333 --> 24:23.800
Uh, no.

24:23.833 --> 24:26.133
You, uh--

24:27.667 --> 24:29.067
What?

24:29.100 --> 24:32.233
Do you answer the phone
in there?

24:32.267 --> 24:36.200
Uh, yeah, I'm on a break.

24:38.567 --> 24:39.967
I'm gonna go.

24:40.000 --> 24:45.000
Sorry, sorry, I--
I've been driving all day.

24:45.033 --> 24:50.667
Well, there's an IHOP
like three feet that way.

24:50.700 --> 24:53.133
I'm looking for someone who
answers the phone in there.

24:53.167 --> 24:56.067
Her name's Cora.

24:56.100 --> 24:59.933
She's got the same voice.

24:59.967 --> 25:01.500
I think you must be confused.

25:01.533 --> 25:04.000
I don't think so.

25:04.033 --> 25:06.867
I mean, it's you, right?

25:06.900 --> 25:09.267
You're the one I spoke to.

25:09.300 --> 25:12.300
My name is Chase. I called you
a couple of days ago.

25:12.333 --> 25:16.567
You answered, you said
a prayer, it went away.

25:16.600 --> 25:17.967
Uh, do you remember?

25:18.000 --> 25:19.933
No, no, this isn't happening.

25:19.967 --> 25:22.367
I mean, it was you, right?

25:23.833 --> 25:25.800
I'm gonna go back--

25:25.833 --> 25:29.833
You said-- you said
a prayer for strength.

25:29.867 --> 25:33.067
It was you. You answered.

25:34.433 --> 25:36.400
You saved me.

25:53.900 --> 25:59.333
* Over my head

26:02.533 --> 26:06.500
* Up above my head
I hear music in the air

26:06.533 --> 26:09.967
* I hear music in the air
Up above my head

26:10.000 --> 26:14.067
* Up above my head
I hear music in the air

26:14.100 --> 26:17.467
* I hear music in the air
Up above my head

26:17.500 --> 26:19.433
Yes!

26:19.467 --> 26:24.433
* I hear music in the air
Up above my head

26:24.467 --> 26:30.533
* I really do hear music
playing above somewhere

26:30.567 --> 26:37.467
* I really do really do believe
there's a heaven somewhere

26:37.500 --> 26:39.367
Free point!

26:39.400 --> 26:41.267
I'm just not sure she's ready.

26:41.300 --> 26:44.200
Was Jesus ready
when he parted the Red Sea?

26:44.233 --> 26:45.900
Wasn't that Moses?

26:45.933 --> 26:47.900
Jeff, you're missing the point.

26:47.933 --> 26:49.667
The question is how are you
feeling? Do you feel

26:49.700 --> 26:51.267
the need to guide?

26:51.300 --> 26:54.133
Oh, she's been here a month and
she's clearly still struggling.

26:54.167 --> 26:56.633
Well, exactly,
time's a wasting .

26:56.667 --> 26:58.000
I don't know, I just think
maybe we should just give her

26:58.033 --> 26:59.267
some more time in the light.

26:59.300 --> 27:02.000
Oh, blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah. Jeff, look at me.

27:02.033 --> 27:04.833
Go for it, dude,
be her shepherd.

27:04.867 --> 27:07.267
It's like Zeta-Jones
and Douglas.

27:07.300 --> 27:09.500
If he hadn't gone for her
Billy Bob-style...

27:09.533 --> 27:12.067
he wouldn't be married
to that New Zealand hottie.

27:12.100 --> 27:13.733
Oh!
Isn't she Welsh?

27:13.767 --> 27:16.067
Georgia!
Aren't they divorced?

27:16.100 --> 27:19.633
I'm telling you, that Serena,
she may be tiny, but she

27:19.667 --> 27:20.500
is mighty.

27:20.533 --> 27:21.767
Well, set her up, set her up.

27:21.800 --> 27:23.900
Pop the ball! Pop it!

27:23.933 --> 27:27.267
Listen to me, quit stalling
and go for it.

27:27.300 --> 27:31.167
If anyone can save that soul,
it's you. Now, go!

27:34.700 --> 27:36.733
What's up, playa?

27:36.767 --> 27:37.567
You good, you good?

27:37.600 --> 27:38.667
Okay.

27:38.700 --> 27:41.167
Not a lot of air in here, huh?
No, none.

27:41.200 --> 27:43.833
You're looking good out there,
it's so good!

27:43.867 --> 27:49.267
If I knew jerseys were optional
I would have wore my bikini,

27:49.300 --> 27:49.633
too.

27:49.667 --> 27:51.533
Not really.

27:54.733 --> 27:57.200
I'm sorry about earlier.

27:57.233 --> 27:59.967
I respect your right to serve
however you wish.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.533
Okay, come on, girl.

28:01.567 --> 28:05.267
Okay, um, thank you.

28:05.300 --> 28:10.533
Serve... I wasn't even
planning that.

28:10.567 --> 28:12.367
Good one.
Yeah.

28:13.967 --> 28:19.200
So, I know you got a lot
going on in there...

28:19.233 --> 28:20.800
that I don't really
know about...

28:20.833 --> 28:24.733
but the thing is...

28:24.767 --> 28:29.400
I just think maybe I can help
you find your way back.

28:29.433 --> 28:33.167
My way back?
Yeah.

28:33.200 --> 28:35.400
Is that what this is all about?

28:35.433 --> 28:39.667
Only a softened heart
can accept God's forgiveness.

28:39.700 --> 28:43.333
A softened heart...

28:43.367 --> 28:46.533
Look, I--
I don't need your help.

28:46.567 --> 28:48.800
I don't need your help,
or Bill's help...

28:48.833 --> 28:51.733
or any of you... people.

28:51.767 --> 28:53.300
Okay? I'm fine.

28:53.333 --> 28:54.500
Totally fine.

28:54.533 --> 28:56.467
All right, Cora, you're up!

28:56.500 --> 28:57.600
Shit.

29:08.400 --> 29:11.067
There you are!

29:11.100 --> 29:12.100
So you guys want
to get out of here?

29:12.133 --> 29:13.533
Yeah.
Yeah.

29:13.567 --> 29:15.367
I know a little after hours
party we can get in.

29:15.400 --> 29:16.733
Oh, yeah?

29:16.767 --> 29:18.033
You want to join, too,
pretty?

29:18.067 --> 29:20.033
Huh? Come on.

29:20.067 --> 29:21.600
Yeah, let's do this.

29:21.633 --> 29:24.267
Oh, yay!
Let's go!

29:58.000 --> 30:00.400
Oh, fuck.

30:26.867 --> 30:29.267
Cora!

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
Do it! Yeah!

31:39.933 --> 31:41.400
SIOBHAN
Thank you for calling

31:41.433 --> 31:42.533
Dial-a-Prayer...

31:42.567 --> 31:44.867
the direct line of
communication between you

31:44.900 --> 31:46.300
and our Lord God in Heaven.

31:46.333 --> 31:49.433
We are honored to serve him
and pray for you.

31:49.467 --> 31:52.000
You have reached us
during off-hours.

31:52.033 --> 31:55.267
Please call us again
between 8:00 AM and 4:00 PM.

31:55.300 --> 31:59.633
Or if you like, press 1
and wait for the beep.

32:10.400 --> 32:12.933
Thank God, Cora,
I have been so worried.

32:12.967 --> 32:15.133
I just need to change my
clothes, Mom.

32:15.167 --> 32:17.500
Can you imagine for one second
what must have been going

32:17.533 --> 32:18.067
through my head?

32:18.100 --> 32:22.167
Leave me alone!
Cora!

32:22.200 --> 32:25.633
And I certainly couldn't call
the police, could I?

32:25.667 --> 32:28.700
Your father pulled a lot
of strings to get you out

32:28.733 --> 32:29.800
of that nightmare!

32:29.833 --> 32:32.067
What you did!

32:32.100 --> 32:34.900
That horrible group!

32:34.933 --> 32:38.033
The trial!
Do not make a mess of this!

32:38.067 --> 32:39.767
You made a mess out of this!
Me?

32:39.800 --> 32:42.467
We did everything that we
possibly could to help you!

32:42.500 --> 32:46.367
We... Mom? He's not here!
He's not here!

32:46.400 --> 32:48.567
And he's not gonna be back
for Thanksgiving.

32:48.600 --> 32:50.433
He'll probably give some
lame excuse and then he's

32:50.467 --> 32:51.333
gonna leave us! Again!

32:51.367 --> 32:53.367
No, he is on a trial,
he is on a deadline!

32:53.400 --> 32:56.167
But if he were here--
if he were here--

32:56.200 --> 32:59.733
But, Mom, when are you
gonna wake the fuck up?

33:02.300 --> 33:04.233
Now, I'm sorry, if you'll
excuse

33:04.267 --> 33:06.300
me, I have to go enlighten
people.

33:06.333 --> 33:09.167
Everyone deserves a second
chance, right, Mom?

33:09.200 --> 33:12.233
Even sacrilegious scum like me?

34:12.132 --> 34:13.833
Look, she's moving.

34:13.867 --> 34:15.067
Oh, my god!

34:15.100 --> 34:16.833
Praise Jesus.

34:16.867 --> 34:18.433
Oh, wow.

34:18.467 --> 34:19.699
That was amazing.

34:22.167 --> 34:25.533
I'm so sorry.

34:25.567 --> 34:27.500
It's okay.

34:31.733 --> 34:33.632
I'm okay.

34:35.400 --> 34:37.233
It's all okay.

34:42.033 --> 34:43.266
Are you all right?

34:43.300 --> 34:45.199
You want me to call someone?

34:45.233 --> 34:46.733
No.

34:49.433 --> 34:52.233
Why don't you stay here

34:52.266 --> 34:52.967
a minute?

34:53.000 --> 34:57.033
I'm gonna be late for work.

34:57.067 --> 35:01.167
I can do this.
I can do this.

35:01.200 --> 35:03.733
You sure you're gonna

35:03.767 --> 35:05.000
be all right?

35:05.033 --> 35:08.633
Yeah... thank you.

35:40.733 --> 35:45.833
Cora! Early riser, as in early
and awake, you get me?

35:45.867 --> 35:48.400
We've had calls lined up
since we opened.

35:48.433 --> 35:50.200
Your faith...
that's what's important.

35:50.233 --> 35:52.167
Hold on to your faith
and just--

35:52.200 --> 35:57.300
Push through,
through the power of prayer.

35:57.333 --> 35:58.600
Yes!

36:01.000 --> 36:03.700
New verbiage we're looking
to incorporate.

36:03.733 --> 36:07.767
Alliteration... we went over
this in the morning meeting.

36:07.800 --> 36:11.333
You'll find instructions
at the front of the binders.

36:11.367 --> 36:16.100
A woman called in this AM,
asking for you specifically.

36:16.133 --> 36:18.733
Said you'd made a real
difference for her.

36:18.767 --> 36:24.467
What'd she say? That,
"you were sent from above."

36:24.500 --> 36:26.067
Really?

36:26.100 --> 36:28.433
I thought you should know.

36:28.467 --> 36:29.767
Serena Belle!

36:29.800 --> 36:34.367
Enough with the music,
you've got three lines blinking

36:34.400 --> 36:36.167
Good afternoon, Dial-a-Prayer,
this is Serena Belle...

36:36.200 --> 36:37.500
how may I pray for you today?

36:39.633 --> 36:41.500
Dial-a-Prayer, this is Cora.

36:41.533 --> 36:45.500
MAN
Hi. Do you remember me?

36:45.533 --> 36:46.700
Parking lot?

36:46.733 --> 36:48.500
What do you want?

36:48.533 --> 36:50.967
MAN
I'm hoping we can start over.

36:51.000 --> 36:54.867
Beyond a prayer, technically
I am not supposed to--

36:54.900 --> 36:55.867
MAN
Look, I came here to meet you,

36:55.900 --> 36:57.100
because you made a difference.

36:57.133 --> 37:01.733
And I'd just really like
to thank you properly.

37:01.767 --> 37:03.533
This isn't happening.

37:03.567 --> 37:04.900
MAN
Let me buy you a cup of coffee,

37:04.933 --> 37:05.633
at least.

37:05.667 --> 37:08.033
I don't know. I--

37:08.067 --> 37:10.200
MAN
There's a burger spot across

37:10.233 --> 37:11.300
from my hotel on 275.

37:11.333 --> 37:15.167
No, I-- no, I don't know.

37:15.200 --> 37:18.600
MAN
It looks halfway decent.

37:18.633 --> 37:20.900
I shouldn't.

37:20.933 --> 37:23.300
MAN
I promise, one cup of coffee,

37:23.333 --> 37:24.467
that's it.

37:24.500 --> 37:26.767
Can you meet me there, please?
Okay! Okay.

37:30.533 --> 37:32.833
Let's always try to wrap it up
with--

37:32.867 --> 37:34.900
"Have a blessed day."
Thank you.

37:34.933 --> 37:36.767
Sure.

38:06.433 --> 38:08.100
Thanks for coming.

38:08.133 --> 38:11.367
Yeah, I can't stay long.

38:17.600 --> 38:19.900
Coffee?

38:19.933 --> 38:22.300
Yeah, coffee's good.

38:23.967 --> 38:26.633
You having an okay day?

38:26.667 --> 38:28.267
It's fine.

38:31.833 --> 38:35.033
So do people like living here?

38:35.067 --> 38:39.733
If you like gray days and
never-ending winter.

38:39.767 --> 38:41.600
You do?

38:41.633 --> 38:45.033
Winter can be nice
sometimes when it first snows..

38:45.067 --> 38:47.067
but after that--

38:47.100 --> 38:49.967
You're still here, though.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.633
Something like that.

38:52.667 --> 38:56.467
Salad bar is getting new
coolant, so it's just

38:56.500 --> 38:57.600
a la carte today.

38:57.633 --> 38:59.667
I'll be back in a minute
to take your order.

38:59.700 --> 39:01.000
Thanks.

39:03.933 --> 39:08.033
So this must be really
anti-climactic for you.

39:08.067 --> 39:09.900
I wouldn't say that.

39:09.933 --> 39:12.300
You don't have to be nice.

39:12.333 --> 39:16.200
Sorry, I don't really go
in for the prayers so much.

39:16.233 --> 39:20.100
You sort of seem like that,
too .

39:20.133 --> 39:22.467
I don't really know
what you were expecting.

39:22.500 --> 39:24.167
I--
Look...

39:24.200 --> 39:27.333
I get it, that something really
great happened to you...

39:27.367 --> 39:29.433
and that's good, you should
hold on to that.

39:29.467 --> 39:30.533
Okay.

39:30.567 --> 39:34.300
But I-- I'm not gonna
make you better.

39:34.333 --> 39:36.567
I'm not gonna keep you better
or

39:36.600 --> 39:38.567
whatever it is that you think.

39:38.600 --> 39:41.567
Maybe not.
For sure, not.

39:41.600 --> 39:44.133
Look, I'm not what you're
looking for.

39:44.167 --> 39:47.667
And you can think whatever
it is, but that's gonna have

39:47.700 --> 39:49.200
to stay in your own head.

39:49.233 --> 39:52.800
I'm not what you need.

39:52.833 --> 39:55.233
You think you know
what I need?

39:58.000 --> 39:59.567
I gotta go.

39:59.600 --> 40:04.000
Look, um, can you-- do you
wanna just take my number?

40:05.367 --> 40:07.200
I just-- I drove
a long way to get here.

40:07.233 --> 40:10.600
I don't know anybody in town.

40:10.633 --> 40:13.000
I don't know, maybe you'll
feel like we could see

40:13.033 --> 40:13.867
each other again?

40:13.900 --> 40:16.533
I won't.

40:16.567 --> 40:19.167
I'm really sorry.

40:35.800 --> 40:37.933
Bless us, O Lord,
for these thy gifts...

40:37.967 --> 40:41.733
which we are about to receive
in Your holy name.

40:41.767 --> 40:46.633
God of all blessings, source
of all life, giver of all grace

40:46.667 --> 40:49.900
We thank you for the gift
of life, with the food

40:49.933 --> 40:51.067
of this earth...

40:51.100 --> 40:54.500
for the mystery of creation,
and for the graces

40:54.533 --> 40:55.367
and blessings.

40:55.400 --> 40:58.533
Your mercy is everlasting
and gracious.

40:58.567 --> 41:02.833
It is always a blessing when we
can share this time together

41:02.867 --> 41:04.567
with family, friends...

41:04.600 --> 41:06.933
and our dearest loved ones.

41:06.967 --> 41:09.333
Amen.

41:36.867 --> 41:38.733
You shouldn't be here.

41:38.767 --> 41:40.467
Had to come.

41:40.500 --> 41:43.600
I was worried
you'd get real time.

41:43.633 --> 41:44.867
Jesse's still at Moun--

41:44.900 --> 41:48.967
I-- I don't want to talk
about it.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.167
At least your father
pulled through.

41:51.200 --> 41:53.367
Everybody else left to hang.

41:53.400 --> 41:56.033
I don't know what's worse.

41:58.100 --> 42:01.467
What is this about?

42:01.500 --> 42:03.667
Are you okay?

42:03.700 --> 42:06.700
I wanted to see you.

42:06.733 --> 42:09.033
See how you were.

42:09.067 --> 42:13.033
Cora, there's no way you
could have known she

42:13.067 --> 42:15.100
was inside the church.

42:15.133 --> 42:17.433
It's so stupid.
You're so stupid.

42:17.467 --> 42:21.233
The hell with those people
and their sacred space!

42:21.267 --> 42:23.267
Only the darkest acts...

42:23.300 --> 42:27.533
will keep us from the pole
of our own negativity.

42:27.567 --> 42:28.867
Please.

42:28.900 --> 42:30.567
You were better with us.

42:30.600 --> 42:35.400
Standing up to the bullshit...
was a good thing.

42:35.433 --> 42:37.633
Lighting a match was the
biggest--

42:37.667 --> 42:38.167
Stop!

42:41.333 --> 42:45.367
Everybody back there
cares for you, Cora.

42:45.400 --> 42:49.500
And you gotta know that
we're the ones who really

42:49.533 --> 42:50.667
got your back.

42:50.700 --> 42:53.367
I don't know.

42:55.100 --> 43:00.033
Um, the woman...

43:00.067 --> 43:04.167
does she have jet black hair,
like porcelain skin,

43:04.200 --> 43:06.467
regal almost, beautiful.

43:06.500 --> 43:08.867
I can't remember.

43:08.900 --> 43:12.100
She could have been gone,
Shane... forever.

43:12.133 --> 43:15.400
And the church is making me
do some bullshit

43:15.433 --> 43:16.600
community service...

43:16.633 --> 43:18.533
because of my asshole,
connected father--

43:18.567 --> 43:19.700
Cora.

43:19.733 --> 43:24.000
And you know what?
No, I feel bad, really bad.

43:24.033 --> 43:26.100
And the shittiest part is...

43:26.133 --> 43:30.133
is that lately people are
starting to treat me

43:30.167 --> 43:31.400
like I'm good.

43:31.433 --> 43:33.833
It's okay.
It's not okay!

43:33.867 --> 43:34.767
It's not!

43:34.800 --> 43:38.333
I mean, how could I be?

43:41.067 --> 43:43.200
Living back here.

43:46.900 --> 43:50.600
We're all waiting for you,
Cora .

43:50.633 --> 43:52.767
This is no place for you.

44:01.467 --> 44:03.333
ANNOUNCER
Can expect up to an inch

44:03.367 --> 44:04.867
of snow and a high of only 30.

44:04.900 --> 44:07.067
Overnight, flurries will
increase with total

44:07.100 --> 44:08.733
accumulations of three inches.

44:08.767 --> 44:10.367
Tonight's low, near 15.

44:10.400 --> 44:14.233
Scattered snow squall activity
tomorrow with a high of 34.

44:14.267 --> 44:16.867
With the wind out of the north
at 19 miles per hour.

44:16.900 --> 44:18.300
It's currently 20--

46:03.667 --> 46:06.067
Hello, Dial-a-Prayer.

46:07.700 --> 46:12.233
MAN
Hi, it's me.

46:12.267 --> 46:15.733
You can't call me here
anymore... okay?

46:15.767 --> 46:18.000
Cora, please don't hang up.

46:22.167 --> 46:24.167
I need to know right now if
what

46:24.200 --> 46:26.500
you're telling me is bullshit..

46:28.033 --> 46:30.967
about me saving you.

46:31.000 --> 46:33.167
I'm sure it is, I just,
I just- -

46:33.200 --> 46:38.133
If you are telling me
the truth, then I need--

46:39.833 --> 46:42.033
I just need to know.

46:42.800 --> 46:45.433
Okay?

46:45.467 --> 46:49.900
You gotta believe me...
can't you?

46:49.933 --> 46:52.433
Please believe me.

46:55.233 --> 46:57.767
I'll be there after work.

47:10.533 --> 47:14.133
Before when I called,
I was in a dark place...

47:14.167 --> 47:16.900
and I-- I don't like
to talk about it...

47:16.933 --> 47:22.867
but-- I mean,
I will if you need me to.

47:22.900 --> 47:24.500
I do.

47:26.067 --> 47:27.500
I don't know.

47:27.533 --> 47:30.233
It's like...

47:30.267 --> 47:34.800
a voice in my head
telling me I'm no good.

47:34.833 --> 47:38.300
You know?

47:38.333 --> 47:42.267
Sometimes when it gets really
loud, I would just-- I would do

47:42.300 --> 47:44.467
anything to get away from it.

47:44.500 --> 47:46.300
Make it stop.

47:46.333 --> 47:50.200
Prayer seemed to settle
everything down for me...

47:50.233 --> 47:56.500
but more than that...
it was you.

47:56.533 --> 47:57.967
I felt it when I met you.

47:58.000 --> 47:59.600
And when I saw you at the diner

47:59.633 --> 48:00.633
it was there again...

48:00.667 --> 48:03.800
and I can't explain it.

48:03.833 --> 48:08.733
But, I don't know...

48:08.767 --> 48:11.433
it was like a calm
came over me .

48:13.767 --> 48:19.333
But... if you don't want me to
come around anymore, I won't.

48:19.367 --> 48:21.267
Okay?

48:23.367 --> 48:26.300
I should probably go,
because-- I don't know--

48:26.333 --> 48:28.633
I'm not--
Please don't go.

48:30.967 --> 48:33.867
You sure?

48:33.900 --> 48:40.767
Yeah, I-- I'd like it
if you stayed.

48:42.633 --> 48:44.367
Okay.

48:47.433 --> 48:49.200
I'd like that.

48:52.900 --> 48:56.867
* Operator operator

48:56.900 --> 49:01.167
* Give me Jesus on the phone

49:01.200 --> 49:04.133
* Operator operator

49:04.167 --> 49:06.867
Bam! That's what
I'm talking about!

49:06.900 --> 49:08.667
Praise God!

49:10.133 --> 49:12.867
Dial-a-Prayer, this is Cora.

49:12.900 --> 49:14.200
Thanks for holding.

49:15.900 --> 49:17.267
Hallelujah!

49:17.300 --> 49:19.733
Okay, I'll circle that.

49:19.767 --> 49:21.367
* Operator

49:21.400 --> 49:23.200
Corresponding average...

49:24.100 --> 49:25.800
Praise God! Praise God!

49:25.833 --> 49:29.533
* Operator
I'm calling Heaven

49:29.567 --> 49:33.400
* And the number is 1 2 3
Okay, I got you.

49:33.433 --> 49:37.733
* That's the father the son
and the Holy Ghost

49:37.767 --> 49:42.333
* Give me Jesus on the phone

49:42.367 --> 49:45.033
You've just dialed a prayer.

50:10.067 --> 50:11.767
So where are we headed?

50:11.800 --> 50:14.567
Hopefully not as far
as last time.

50:14.600 --> 50:17.400
North... keep going.

50:36.133 --> 50:40.467
So this is the draw, huh?

50:40.500 --> 50:45.633
I know, I mean, it's not--
it's not much, but...

50:45.667 --> 50:50.800
this flat, white surface--
doesn't mean anything to you?

50:50.833 --> 50:54.433
Yeah, the new-ness.

50:54.467 --> 50:59.633
Nothing's happened to it.
It's so white.

50:59.667 --> 51:02.633
Yeah, it's very white.

51:02.667 --> 51:05.700
I don't know, doesn't that kind
of make it boring, though?

51:05.733 --> 51:09.467
I mean, like how long can
it stay like this before

51:09.500 --> 51:10.733
it melts...

51:10.767 --> 51:12.900
or a deer shits on it,
or a truck drives through it?

51:12.933 --> 51:17.233
You know, then what?
Then it's no good?

51:17.267 --> 51:21.333
I mean, you can't stay
perfect forever.

51:23.233 --> 51:25.067
I know.

52:19.800 --> 52:23.167
But did you remember to make
a list of all the good things

52:23.200 --> 52:25.267
that came out of getting fired?

52:26.733 --> 52:29.067
No, I-- I get that.

52:29.100 --> 52:32.400
I don't know, maybe think
about the walk that you can

52:32.433 --> 52:33.433
take in the morning.

52:33.467 --> 52:36.300
Cora, it is amazing.
Um, hold, please.

52:36.333 --> 52:38.967
We've had calls backed up
for you for the past hour.

52:39.000 --> 52:40.400
You are on to something.

52:40.433 --> 52:42.367
Is it the manuals?

52:42.400 --> 52:44.267
Do you find them helpful?
Or is it--

52:44.300 --> 52:45.133
Cora!

52:45.167 --> 52:47.067
Girl, you are a rock star!

52:47.100 --> 52:51.100
I mean, genius, so, so genius!

52:51.133 --> 52:54.067
My teachings are helping, no?

52:54.100 --> 52:57.433
Our numbers are double the
drive-through center in Barst.

52:57.467 --> 52:59.933
Seriously, they are like
eating our dust!

52:59.967 --> 53:01.900
And just think of the lives
that

53:01.933 --> 53:03.967
you've touched or we've touched

53:04.000 --> 53:05.800
Cora, you must feel so light.

53:05.833 --> 53:08.500
Cora, you're an inspiration!

53:08.533 --> 53:10.033
Cora, you have like
six lines waiting.

53:10.067 --> 53:12.133
Get the phone, honey.

53:12.167 --> 53:15.867
Guys, we may have to work
overtime today.

53:15.900 --> 53:17.733
Overtime.

53:17.767 --> 53:19.200
Yea-yah!

53:22.967 --> 53:25.367
Um, thank you for holding.

53:28.667 --> 53:33.533
When I was a kid, I used to do
these crazy Google searches...

53:33.567 --> 53:40.733
looking for towns
with weird names, like Taco.

53:40.767 --> 53:43.833
Named Nothing or Somewhere.

53:43.867 --> 53:47.500
But any city I'd ever go to,
I'd always like to find

53:47.533 --> 53:48.700
a place like this.

53:48.733 --> 53:52.333
I would look at all the lights,
and I would imagine a person

53:52.367 --> 53:54.467
for every one of those lights.

53:56.833 --> 53:59.333
It's amazing.

53:59.367 --> 54:02.233
Kind of all looks pretty
from over here.

54:02.267 --> 54:03.467
Hm.

54:03.500 --> 54:07.467
When things got bad for me
last couple of years...

54:10.533 --> 54:14.100
I remember they said it was
chemical or some shit, but...

54:14.133 --> 54:16.267
I couldn't stop thinking...

54:20.133 --> 54:22.433
"My lights going out...

54:23.800 --> 54:27.533
"And no one is even noticing."

54:31.100 --> 54:34.367
I thought I could fix it...

54:34.400 --> 54:38.300
if I-- if I found a town
called Somewhere.

54:39.833 --> 54:43.167
You know, that if I--
if I went there...

54:43.200 --> 54:46.667
and I left everything and
everyone, it had to be

54:46.700 --> 54:48.167
a place that mattered.

54:48.200 --> 54:50.100
You know, a place where
I wouldn't get lost.

54:50.133 --> 54:54.667
Or if I did get lost,
it would be okay.

54:56.933 --> 54:59.867
I don't know.

54:59.900 --> 55:01.867
You seem like someone
who pays attention

55:01.900 --> 55:03.267
when the lights go out.

55:05.900 --> 55:08.433
Real attention.

55:14.567 --> 55:15.700
Hm.

55:17.367 --> 55:20.567
You ever wish
you could start over?

55:20.600 --> 55:23.667
I do.

55:25.500 --> 55:27.700
Completely from scratch.

55:34.633 --> 55:36.200
See you later.

55:36.233 --> 55:38.533
Hey-ho!
Good morning.

55:38.567 --> 55:41.767
Morning, there, Jeff.
Good morning!

55:41.800 --> 55:43.100
Hey... Cora.

55:43.133 --> 55:47.067
* Make sure the chimney
is clear

55:47.100 --> 55:51.800
* I wouldn't miss this
sight of you this Christmas

55:51.833 --> 55:54.300
Hey, it's got a reindeer!

55:56.733 --> 55:58.133
See you later.

55:59.700 --> 56:02.133
Oh, I remember that.

56:02.167 --> 56:05.767
It was the Chancel Drama,
you were the Angel Gabriel.

56:05.800 --> 56:07.933
What?

56:07.967 --> 56:10.767
Look, the wings are
practically twice your size.

56:10.800 --> 56:12.100
That was beautiful.

56:16.967 --> 56:18.900
Tell me.

56:18.933 --> 56:21.333
Well, the Angel Gabriel
went to visit Mary

56:21.367 --> 56:22.700
in Nazareth...

56:22.733 --> 56:26.300
and told her that she would
give birth to the son of God.

56:26.333 --> 56:28.767
Which was not possible,
because Mary was a virgin...

56:28.800 --> 56:33.567
but Gabriel said that nothing
was impossible with God.

56:33.600 --> 56:39.533
And then you stood up at age
four and you proclaimed...

56:39.567 --> 56:44.767
in the clearest of voices,
"Nothing is impossible

56:44.800 --> 56:46.133
with God."

56:48.633 --> 56:51.033
You were a little angel.

56:52.767 --> 56:54.567
Hm.

56:54.600 --> 56:57.300
Yeah, I guess I was.

57:09.833 --> 57:11.567
Hey.
Hey.

57:21.100 --> 57:23.833
I got a call... you'll
never guess from where.

57:23.867 --> 57:25.033
Who?

57:25.067 --> 57:28.000
Not who, where?

57:28.033 --> 57:31.000
Somewhere.
No way.

57:31.033 --> 57:32.967
She said she was
from Somewhere...

57:33.000 --> 57:36.367
and I asked her to clarify and-
Wow.

57:36.400 --> 57:37.667
I'm serious.

57:37.700 --> 57:39.267
Well, there you go.

57:39.300 --> 57:41.700
Pretty odd chances, right?

57:45.667 --> 57:47.233
Are you okay?

57:47.267 --> 57:51.700
Yeah, no, Somewhere,
it's crazy.

57:53.533 --> 57:57.867
You think the prayers really
make a difference?

57:57.900 --> 58:00.333
Seems that's what people
believe anyway.

58:00.367 --> 58:03.600
Maybe believing it's working
is enough, you know?

58:03.633 --> 58:05.600
Yeah.

58:05.633 --> 58:11.833
Or maybe it's just being
there for someone is all.

58:11.867 --> 58:15.467
Like I was there for you...
right?

58:15.500 --> 58:17.300
Yeah.

58:22.200 --> 58:25.133
You think you'll stay
in town for a while?

58:25.167 --> 58:29.033
Yeah, I think so, for now.

58:29.067 --> 58:31.333
Looking around for some work.

58:56.767 --> 58:58.267
Thank you, Cora!

58:58.300 --> 59:00.500
Cora! Cora!

59:09.967 --> 59:11.633
Pray for me, Cora!

59:11.667 --> 59:16.733
Oh, praise Jesus!
Hallelujah!

59:33.333 --> 59:35.533
MAN
It's all a myth!

59:35.567 --> 59:36.633
Based on nothing!

59:36.667 --> 59:38.933
These empty phrases.

59:41.933 --> 59:44.433
MAN
You people think you're

59:44.467 --> 59:44.867
helping.

59:44.900 --> 59:47.067
Do it!
Do it!

59:47.100 --> 59:48.633
MAN
This machine that asks you

59:48.667 --> 59:49.300
to pray to what?

59:49.333 --> 59:50.500
Come on, Cora!

59:50.533 --> 59:51.967
MAN
The same old stories?

59:52.000 --> 59:53.733
Do it! Do it!

59:53.767 --> 59:55.767
Come on! Do it! Do it!

59:57.567 --> 59:59.467
Yeah! Yeah!

59:59.500 --> 01:00:00.900
Come on!

01:00:00.933 --> 01:00:02.733
MAN
What does the church represent?

01:00:02.767 --> 01:00:04.567
What they say?
What they've done?

01:00:06.167 --> 01:00:09.767
Religion is the thing that
destroys countries.

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:15.100
Look at all the wars
in the last century.

01:00:15.133 --> 01:00:19.067
How many are connected to this
idea of how to worship?

01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:21.367
Go.
Let's go.

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:24.467
Cora! Cora!

01:00:25.433 --> 01:00:28.167
Cora!

01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:30.733
MAN
And you, you people there with

01:00:30.767 --> 01:00:31.600
your amen's...

01:00:31.633 --> 01:00:34.400
and your praise this.

01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:43.267
You should be ashamed
of yourselves.

01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:46.167
Did you happen to look at page
nine where that younger

01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:47.567
demographic is highlighted?

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:53.067
They just love to watch
these things on the web.

01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:56.867
No, no! Ho, I get limited
resources, but listen, man...

01:00:56.900 --> 01:01:00.933
sometimes you have--

01:01:00.967 --> 01:01:04.467
No-- okay...
thank you, Reverend.

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:07.000
Sorry to interrupt.

01:01:07.033 --> 01:01:08.900
Cora... come in.

01:01:08.933 --> 01:01:10.633
Sorry for the mess.

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:17.533
Are you okay?
Yeah, fine, what's up?

01:01:19.333 --> 01:01:23.333
I just lost track of my hours,
so I was wondering...

01:01:24.967 --> 01:01:26.000
how much longer?

01:01:26.033 --> 01:01:29.467
Oh, well...

01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:34.033
things are certainly proving
to work out well, right?

01:01:34.067 --> 01:01:37.167
Yeah. I-- um--

01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:42.867
All right, Cora, let's say
your hours are met.

01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:44.133
Yeah?

01:01:44.167 --> 01:01:46.433
But do you really
think you're done?

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:54.767
I just-- yes.

01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:58.300
How does it feel?

01:01:58.333 --> 01:02:01.533
I don't know, I'm just doing
what you told me to do, and--

01:02:01.567 --> 01:02:04.200
No, no, believing.

01:02:04.233 --> 01:02:06.467
How does it feel to believe?

01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:09.767
Yeah, sure, you're following
instructions, you're getting

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:10.800
here on-time.

01:02:10.833 --> 01:02:15.300
But think about it,
what's changed?

01:02:15.333 --> 01:02:16.500
You believe.

01:02:16.533 --> 01:02:21.100
You see? You just needed
something to believe in.

01:02:21.133 --> 01:02:25.833
I don't really think it's that.

01:02:25.867 --> 01:02:30.500
Oh, Cora, stick with this.

01:02:30.533 --> 01:02:34.133
See it through. I think
you're on to something...

01:02:34.167 --> 01:02:37.933
something real,
something bigger--

01:02:37.967 --> 01:02:41.633
Something bigger
than even we can know.

01:02:43.833 --> 01:02:46.700
Okay.

01:02:46.733 --> 01:02:49.667
Okay, um, thank you
for your time.

01:02:52.267 --> 01:02:54.467
Something.

01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:56.167
Something real.

01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:09.900
Tell me again.

01:03:09.933 --> 01:03:11.967
Hide not thy face from me

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:12.900
in the day...

01:03:12.933 --> 01:03:15.300
when I am in trouble.

01:03:15.333 --> 01:03:20.100
Something, something...
when I call...

01:03:20.133 --> 01:03:23.033
answer me speedily.

01:03:23.067 --> 01:03:25.567
That's beautiful.

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:27.600
Yeah, I think so.

01:03:27.633 --> 01:03:29.900
It's the one I really like.

01:03:29.933 --> 01:03:32.800
Makes sense.

01:03:32.833 --> 01:03:36.067
I don't know.

01:03:36.100 --> 01:03:39.367
You're a good person, Cora.

01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:40.700
Remember that.

01:03:41.833 --> 01:03:43.667
Okay.

01:03:46.733 --> 01:03:49.533
Will I see you later?

01:03:49.567 --> 01:03:51.400
Yeah.

01:03:59.967 --> 01:04:02.700
You know, I think
he's gotta be married.

01:04:02.733 --> 01:04:04.767
What?
Married!

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:08.400
I mean, I hate to say it,
but I've seen this too many

01:04:08.433 --> 01:04:09.133
times before.

01:04:09.167 --> 01:04:11.267
Let me break it down for you.

01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:14.600
He shows up out of nowhere,
right? Out of the blue?

01:04:14.633 --> 01:04:17.467
This beautiful stranger man--

01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:20.000
You gotta admit, he doesn't
sound like the type that's

01:04:20.033 --> 01:04:21.267
gonna
frequent a phone line to God.

01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:23.300
Well, you don't know.

01:04:23.333 --> 01:04:25.833
Okay, maybe, yeah, maybe
it's all on the up and up.

01:04:25.867 --> 01:04:26.900
Yeah, maybe.

01:04:26.933 --> 01:04:28.433
We're just talking.

01:04:28.467 --> 01:04:31.067
Yeah, now you're just talking.
Uh, oh.

01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:34.567
I get it.
And you?

01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:37.967
You got your story?

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.100
My story?

01:04:40.133 --> 01:04:42.233
What you did,
where you come from?

01:04:42.267 --> 01:04:44.767
Look, if he's really serious
about all this...

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:45.700
a believer...
I get where you're

01:04:45.733 --> 01:04:47.167
going with this.

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:49.633
You don't think he deserves to
know sooner rather than later?

01:04:49.667 --> 01:04:51.700
Oh, Jesus.

01:04:51.733 --> 01:04:53.800
Look, Cora, I'm just--
I'm just trying to keep you

01:04:53.833 --> 01:04:54.600
from getting hurt.

01:04:54.633 --> 01:04:55.867
I get it, okay?

01:04:55.900 --> 01:04:58.367
Oh, my god!

01:05:13.433 --> 01:05:18.333
Um, O Father of mercies
and God of all comfort.

01:05:18.367 --> 01:05:21.133
Our only one we need
in time of need.

01:05:24.867 --> 01:05:26.600
O Father of mercies
and God of all comfort.

01:05:26.633 --> 01:05:28.167
Our only hope in time of need.

01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:30.267
We believe your sage
that we behold...

01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:34.367
visit and relieve our sick
servant until our prayers

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:35.367
are desired.

01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:38.700
Look upon him with mercy
and comfort and restore

01:05:38.733 --> 01:05:39.700
him to health.

01:05:39.733 --> 01:05:45.233
To-- t--

01:05:45.267 --> 01:05:50.833
To take away the residue of his
life and lead him to thy glory,

01:05:50.867 --> 01:05:52.100
to thy faith--

01:05:52.133 --> 01:05:57.067
Cora, Cora, honey, it's okay.

01:05:57.100 --> 01:06:00.167
It's okay, you can stop now.

01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:01.533
He was just walking

01:06:01.567 --> 01:06:02.467
across the floor.

01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:19.300
Waiting on Dad?

01:06:19.333 --> 01:06:22.867
He told me he would be here
through the holidays.

01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:25.633
Right.

01:06:25.667 --> 01:06:27.433
And I believed him.

01:06:30.067 --> 01:06:33.533
I am gonna be out.
I'm not coming home tonight.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.800
What was it you believed
when you were down there

01:06:40.833 --> 01:06:41.900
with those people?

01:06:41.933 --> 01:06:44.300
What?

01:06:44.333 --> 01:06:47.567
Why would you do such a thing--

01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:49.467
I-- I really don't want
to talk about this.

01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:52.867
Do you know we are still the
subject of every dinner party?

01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:54.267
We have one of those kids.

01:06:54.300 --> 01:06:57.167
But you are not a kid
any more, are you?

01:06:57.200 --> 01:07:02.267
You could be starting out and--
what happened to you?

01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:05.767
How did you go from my
beautiful, sweet,

01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:08.000
little angel girl to that?

01:07:08.033 --> 01:07:09.300
Leaving me here trying to
figure

01:07:09.333 --> 01:07:11.233
out how you could just destroy
something...

01:07:11.267 --> 01:07:18.333
that is so sacred to us,
to the whole city, the church!

01:07:18.367 --> 01:07:20.133
The church!

01:07:20.167 --> 01:07:22.333
That poor woman!
I'm leaving now.

01:07:22.367 --> 01:07:26.733
This is not just going
to go away, Cora.

01:07:26.767 --> 01:07:28.167
Cora--

01:07:30.533 --> 01:07:33.267
No, I do not know his last name
but come on, dude, he's been

01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:34.633
staying here for a while.

01:07:34.667 --> 01:07:36.033
Can't do it.

01:07:36.067 --> 01:07:38.000
We were supposed to meet.

01:07:38.033 --> 01:07:39.433
Policies.

01:07:39.467 --> 01:07:43.000
I've left him
like five messages.

01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:46.533
Shit.

01:08:09.167 --> 01:08:12.533
* You're all I ever wanted

01:08:52.067 --> 01:08:54.700
Are you married?

01:08:54.733 --> 01:08:56.533
What?
Are you married?

01:08:56.567 --> 01:09:00.133
I'm not an idiot, I have
female intuition, and-- and--

01:09:00.167 --> 01:09:04.000
Okay, no, no, I'm not.

01:09:04.033 --> 01:09:06.733
How long have you been
sitting out here?

01:09:06.767 --> 01:09:09.433
Where were you?

01:09:09.466 --> 01:09:12.466
I'm sorry.

01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:15.667
I waited for you.
I waited for you.

01:09:15.700 --> 01:09:17.600
I know, I'm sorry.

01:09:20.067 --> 01:09:23.300
I'm sorry.

01:09:23.332 --> 01:09:27.633
Look, it's freezing out here.
Come inside, let's get you warm

01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:10.733
Yes, Marilyn, yes,

01:12:10.767 --> 01:12:12.200
it was delivered.

01:12:12.233 --> 01:12:15.933
Circled, yes,
prayer for health.

01:12:15.967 --> 01:12:18.933
Well, we didn't--

01:12:18.967 --> 01:12:21.867
Well, I am indeed
very sorry to hear that...

01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:24.867
but let us pray together
now for strength...

01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:28.000
to move up and through
this challenging time--

01:12:28.033 --> 01:12:32.267
Marilyn? Marilyn?
Marilyn?

01:12:36.833 --> 01:12:38.500
What are you looking at?

01:12:42.933 --> 01:12:44.833
Where's Siobhan?

01:12:44.867 --> 01:12:47.100
I thought you knew.

01:12:47.133 --> 01:12:49.467
Leave of absence.

01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:09.533
Hey, what's the rush?

01:13:09.567 --> 01:13:14.333
That picture in your room...
who is that?

01:13:16.533 --> 01:13:18.533
Look, let's go someplace--
No, no!

01:13:18.567 --> 01:13:21.067
Tell me.

01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:25.300
It's the woman from the church,
isn't it?

01:13:25.333 --> 01:13:27.033
You know her.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:31.467
Look, I can explain, okay?

01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:35.567
She's okay,
she's doing better...

01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:39.233
but it was bad,
it was bad for a long time.

01:13:39.267 --> 01:13:42.300
I had to put her in a home.
I lost my job.

01:13:42.333 --> 01:13:45.067
Look, I didn't know anything.

01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:48.867
All I knew was that some girl,
some name did this

01:13:48.900 --> 01:13:50.733
to my mother and got away.

01:13:50.767 --> 01:13:53.833
And I couldn't make sense of it
so I wanted to come here...

01:13:53.867 --> 01:13:56.333
and I wanted to find you
and do something, and I didn't

01:13:56.367 --> 01:13:57.767
know what...

01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:01.367
so I just drove here and then--
and then it changed the second

01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:02.467
I met you.

01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:05.267
You--
It changed the second I met you

01:14:05.300 --> 01:14:07.967
You drove here and then--

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.567
Everything that happened
between us is real.

01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:11.900
This is not--

01:14:11.933 --> 01:14:14.000
You've changed me.

01:14:14.033 --> 01:14:16.533
I am so stupid.

01:14:16.567 --> 01:14:19.167
I am so stupid.

01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:22.067
Believing that you--

01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:23.533
You actually wanted me.

01:14:23.567 --> 01:14:25.633
Believing that I was
making a difference.

01:14:25.667 --> 01:14:26.967
Cora.
I don't care!

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.667
I'm just doing it
to get out of it.

01:14:28.700 --> 01:14:31.633
That is not true. Okay? You're
making a difference for me.

01:14:31.667 --> 01:14:33.433
You gotta believe that.
I don't believe you.

01:14:33.467 --> 01:14:36.233
I don't believe in any of this.
This is all bullshit!

01:14:36.267 --> 01:14:39.233
You're bullshit!
Cora, come on.

01:15:22.133 --> 01:15:24.333
Not the greatest look,
I know.

01:15:25.533 --> 01:15:27.367
You look beautiful.

01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:35.400
Jeff has a girlfriend
they tell me.

01:15:35.433 --> 01:15:36.600
Yes.
Oh.

01:15:36.633 --> 01:15:40.867
Yes, he, uh-- he even started
taking off Thursdays.

01:15:40.900 --> 01:15:42.400
Oh, good for him!

01:15:42.433 --> 01:15:45.033
And Bill created
a new division...

01:15:45.067 --> 01:15:48.333
prayers for the economy.

01:15:48.367 --> 01:15:51.467
What? There are
no flies on Bill.

01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:52.933
That's for sure.

01:15:52.967 --> 01:15:56.600
And you?
How are you doing, Cora?

01:15:58.500 --> 01:16:01.500
I'm okay.

01:16:01.533 --> 01:16:03.733
Bullshit.

01:16:03.767 --> 01:16:06.233
Correct.

01:16:06.267 --> 01:16:08.867
Everybody has a past, Cora.

01:16:08.900 --> 01:16:10.200
You can't let what's come
before

01:16:10.233 --> 01:16:12.633
stop you from seeing what's
right in front of you.

01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:16.900
You think I'm not pissed?

01:16:16.933 --> 01:16:21.433
You think I haven't had my fair
share of angry, "screw you"

01:16:21.467 --> 01:16:22.033
moments?

01:16:22.067 --> 01:16:25.233
Who am I gonna blame? Huh?

01:16:25.267 --> 01:16:29.567
I just have to believe that
there is a plan for me.

01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:31.967
For us.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:36.400
And I have to ride it out
gracefully.

01:16:36.433 --> 01:16:42.167
It's funny, but you know,
I really miss that place.

01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:45.000
Made me feel good about it all.

01:16:45.033 --> 01:16:49.867
I think everybody wants
to believe something.

01:16:49.900 --> 01:16:54.467
God, the universe,
whatever it is.

01:16:55.900 --> 01:16:58.333
Makes them feel better.

01:16:58.367 --> 01:17:00.933
Believing there is good
in people.

01:17:00.967 --> 01:17:05.333
Something good in all of us.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.467
Dial-a-Prayer, this is Cora.

01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:31.533
Yes, hi, Sandy,
nice to talk to you again.

01:17:31.567 --> 01:17:35.933
Yes, how is, uh--
how's your dog? Still sick?

01:17:35.967 --> 01:17:37.867
Oh, whoa, whoa.

01:17:37.900 --> 01:17:40.200
Okay, well,
start from the beginning.

01:17:44.333 --> 01:17:45.300
Mm.

01:17:45.333 --> 01:17:48.200
Well, you're
stronger than that .

01:17:48.233 --> 01:17:51.033
Completely and you don't
deserve that, and you

01:17:51.067 --> 01:17:52.167
should leave.

01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:56.100
This is Cora.

01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:09.533
Dial-a-Prayer?

01:18:13.300 --> 01:18:16.833
Hello?

01:18:16.867 --> 01:18:21.167
Is it you?

01:18:25.733 --> 01:18:27.767
Are you there?

01:18:29.033 --> 01:18:31.333
Just press it.

01:18:32.933 --> 01:18:34.267
Yup.

01:18:59.233 --> 01:19:03.967
They tell me you've met your
hours and then some.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.867
Thinking you'll stay on?

01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:09.100
I don't know.

01:19:09.133 --> 01:19:11.933
Your mother's enjoyed
having you here.

01:19:11.967 --> 01:19:14.300
I know.

01:19:14.333 --> 01:19:18.700
Well, then, seems like
you're on a better path.

01:19:25.367 --> 01:19:27.633
Cora.

01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:35.567
We miss you when you don't
come back, you know?

01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:39.100
She does.

01:19:39.133 --> 01:19:42.633
She deserves better from you.

01:19:44.833 --> 01:19:48.000
You never asked me
why I did it.

01:19:48.033 --> 01:19:51.333
You just said that
you would take care of it.

01:19:53.067 --> 01:19:58.267
But do you ever wonder
why I ended up down there?

01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:06.400
I did it, because I
wanted to feel something...

01:20:07.633 --> 01:20:12.433
all the way through me.

01:20:12.467 --> 01:20:17.733
And I wanted to be seen...
really seen.

01:21:41.667 --> 01:21:48.667
* All upon the wayside
lead me gently home

01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:02.700
Hey, Bill, can I talk
to you for a second?

01:22:02.733 --> 01:22:05.667
Sure. Walk with me.

01:22:17.067 --> 01:22:19.533
Do you think it mattered?

01:22:19.567 --> 01:22:22.333
What do you mean?

01:22:22.367 --> 01:22:28.367
Me, being here, answering
those phones those weeks.

01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:30.233
Did it matter?

01:22:30.267 --> 01:22:32.333
I think it did, I know it did.

01:22:34.667 --> 01:22:41.300
I don't know, I wish
I could take it all back.

01:22:43.333 --> 01:22:45.100
I know.

01:22:45.133 --> 01:22:48.467
I guess I kind of liked
all this.

01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:54.167
Believing that I could help,
make something happen.

01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:58.267
You have, Cora.
You know that.

01:22:59.367 --> 01:23:02.167
Maybe.

01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:06.133
But I don't know
if any of that matters.

01:23:06.167 --> 01:23:10.133
The charts and the goals
and the praying from binders.

01:23:10.167 --> 01:23:16.367
Are what, to make us feel
better about our own lives?

01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:22.133
I think-- I think
Siobhan says it best.

01:23:22.167 --> 01:23:25.333
Miracles happen every day.

01:23:25.367 --> 01:23:31.433
Every day, everywhere,
and never, right?

01:23:31.467 --> 01:23:36.167
Well, that's-- that's
one way of putting it.

01:23:36.200 --> 01:23:38.233
And I think you were right.

01:23:38.267 --> 01:23:44.200
I think... I know I'm done.

01:23:44.233 --> 01:23:49.000
And I finally know what
I'm supposed to do next.

01:24:34.900 --> 01:24:39.933
Hey, folks, there's still
three hours left in this day...

01:24:39.967 --> 01:24:41.900
according to my watch.

01:24:41.933 --> 01:24:44.167
There's time! Time to help!

01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:48.133
We can still make a difference,
we can.

01:24:48.167 --> 01:24:52.533
Blessed are they who show mercy
for mercy shall be theirs.

01:24:52.567 --> 01:24:55.300
Merc--

01:25:09.367 --> 01:25:12.000
Thank you for calling
Dial-a-Prayer, this is Bill.

01:25:12.033 --> 01:25:15.300
How may I pray for you today?

01:25:15.333 --> 01:25:18.267
Dial-a-Prayer, this is Jeff.

01:25:18.300 --> 01:25:20.767
This is Serena Belle.
Marlene Hammond.

01:25:26.433 --> 01:25:28.467
Going out?

01:25:31.367 --> 01:25:34.067
You know what? I'm picking up
the turkey tomorrow...

01:25:34.100 --> 01:25:37.000
and maybe even getting
a bunch of st--

01:25:37.033 --> 01:25:39.033
That's great, Mom.

01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:49.767
I'm sorry... about--
about all of it.

01:25:51.333 --> 01:25:54.067
About everything
I put you through.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:59.567
And I need you to know
that I'm gonna be okay.

01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:02.467
I need you to know that.

01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:05.700
That rage was not you.

01:26:05.733 --> 01:26:08.267
It was me.

01:26:08.300 --> 01:26:10.433
It is me.

01:26:10.467 --> 01:26:14.100
But you don't need
to worry about it.

01:26:14.133 --> 01:26:17.033
You just need to let it be.

01:26:19.733 --> 01:26:23.467
I should never have
left you to cry.

01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:25.367
What?

01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:28.367
When you were a tiny baby,
it took forever to put

01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:29.100
you to sleep...

01:26:29.133 --> 01:26:32.733
and it was exhausting.

01:26:32.767 --> 01:26:34.933
So I got one of those books,
because that's what everybody

01:26:34.967 --> 01:26:36.200
else was doing...

01:26:36.233 --> 01:26:41.133
And then, one night I just
left you there calling out

01:26:41.167 --> 01:26:42.767
for I don't know--

01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:45.533
I don't even know how
long it was, maybe an hour.

01:26:45.567 --> 01:26:46.300
Mom--

01:26:46.333 --> 01:26:48.400
No, wait, let me finish.

01:26:48.433 --> 01:26:52.100
I did that because I thought it
was the right thing to do...

01:26:52.133 --> 01:26:56.000
but my gut was telling me
that it was wrong.

01:26:56.033 --> 01:27:00.233
And so many times
since then, I--

01:27:00.267 --> 01:27:05.300
I have not been able to even
feel my own gut.

01:27:05.333 --> 01:27:09.533
And I'm sorry, I'm sorry it
started there with you.

01:27:09.567 --> 01:27:13.767
You know what, sometimes
when we are lost...

01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:17.667
we listen to all
the wrong instructions.

01:27:21.733 --> 01:27:24.767
I'm gonna be all right.

01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:27.333
I really think
I'm gonna be okay.

01:27:27.367 --> 01:27:30.700
I know.

01:27:35.633 --> 01:27:37.533
Merry Christmas.

01:27:37.567 --> 01:27:40.033
Merry Christmas.

01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:17.700
* It's a fine line
in front of me

01:28:21.267 --> 01:28:26.567
* It's not a light
embracing me

01:28:28.367 --> 01:28:34.000
* But oh how good
it is to be

01:28:52.567 --> 01:28:56.733
* We can go we can go
we can go we can go

01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:04.333
* Way way away from here

01:29:04.367 --> 01:29:08.267
Cora.

01:29:08.300 --> 01:29:13.133
* We can go we can go
we can go we can go

01:29:16.333 --> 01:29:21.233
* Away away away from here

01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:03.333
CORA
Hi, it's me.

01:30:03.367 --> 01:30:08.200
This is like the closest
I can come to praying.

01:30:08.233 --> 01:30:13.900
So-- so here it goes.

01:30:13.933 --> 01:30:17.667
CORA
A prayer for me.

01:30:17.700 --> 01:30:21.033
I believe in you.

01:30:21.067 --> 01:30:25.167
I believe in the good in you.

01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:29.200
And I believe in what
you did for me.

01:30:29.233 --> 01:30:34.200
Showing me that I could
make a difference.

01:30:34.233 --> 01:30:38.333
And giving me a chance.

01:30:38.367 --> 01:30:40.267
A second chance.

01:30:42.367 --> 01:30:44.833
CORA
And if you do believe in me,

01:30:44.867 --> 01:30:46.167
like you said you did.

01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:52.133
I'm, um-- I'm going somewhere.

01:30:52.167 --> 01:30:55.300
I found it, and...

01:30:55.333 --> 01:31:00.200
I don't know,
maybe you'll meet me...

01:31:00.233 --> 01:31:05.867
and maybe we could
just start again...

01:31:05.900 --> 01:31:07.633
completely from scratch.

01:31:39.933 --> 01:31:44.400
* We can go we can go
we can go we can go

01:31:47.967 --> 01:31:52.133
* Way way away from here

01:31:55.900 --> 01:32:00.600
* We can go we can go
we can go we can go

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:08.200
* Away away away from here

01:32:29.733 --> 01:32:33.833
* Operator operator

01:32:33.867 --> 01:32:37.933
* Give me Jesus on the phone

01:32:37.967 --> 01:32:42.067
* Operator operator

01:32:42.100 --> 01:32:45.933
* Find him somewhere
round that throne

01:32:45.967 --> 01:32:50.167
* Calling Jesus
person to person

01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:54.200
* I want to talk to him alone

01:32:54.233 --> 01:32:57.900
* Long distance operator

01:32:57.933 --> 01:33:02.733
* Give me Jesus on the phone

01:33:02.767 --> 01:33:06.233
* Operator I'm calling heaven

01:33:06.267 --> 01:33:10.667
* And the number is 1 2 3

01:33:10.700 --> 01:33:14.067
* That's the father the son
and the Holy Ghost

01:33:14.100 --> 01:33:18.667
* He means everything to me

01:33:18.700 --> 01:33:21.400
* When you get him
on the line

01:33:21.433 --> 01:33:23.233
* Let me know

01:33:23.267 --> 01:33:26.800
* I want to talk to Jesus
tell him how I love him so

01:33:26.833 --> 01:33:30.767
* Long distance operator

01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:34.667
* Give me Jesus on the phone

01:33:34.700 --> 01:33:38.833
* Hello Jesus
this is your child

01:33:38.867 --> 01:33:42.767
* I want to talk to you
a while

01:33:42.800 --> 01:33:46.800
* I tried to call you
yesterday

01:33:46.833 --> 01:33:50.633
* But confusion got all
in my way

01:33:50.667 --> 01:33:54.700
* Now I cleared the line
I'm feeling fine

01:33:54.733 --> 01:33:58.500
* Thought I'd call you now
because my Jesus found

01:33:58.533 --> 01:34:06.533
* Oh Mr. Operator
give me Jesus on the phone

01:34:06.567 --> 01:34:10.900
* Yes I hope I'm not
too late Lord

01:34:10.933 --> 01:34:14.767
* To be calling you up there

01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:18.033
* But I remember one day
you told me

01:34:18.067 --> 01:34:22.167
* To call you anytime
and anywhere

01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:24.867
* Yes it's late at night

01:34:24.900 --> 01:34:27.367
* Dark in my room

01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:30.500
* Talking better now
and my heart is in tune

01:34:30.533 --> 01:34:38.233
* Oh Mr. Operator
give me Jesus on the phone

01:34:38.267 --> 01:34:42.167
* I'm calling Jesus
person to person

01:34:42.200 --> 01:34:47.633
* I want to talk to him alone
Yeah Lord

01:34:47.667 --> 01:34:51.000
* Mr. Operator

01:34:51.033 --> 01:34:55.233
* Give me Jesus on the phone

01:34:56.305 --> 01:35:02.555
