I'm JD Ryznar.

01:20.381 --> 01:22.281
Today we're gonna tell
a story

01:22.283 --> 01:25.551
about the invention
of the telephone.

01:25.553 --> 01:28.187
<i>Our story starts in the 1870s</i>

01:28.189 --> 01:31.790
<i>with a telegraph corporation</i>
<i>Western Union.</i>

01:31.792 --> 01:33.959
<i>And Western Union</i>
<i>was trying to go like,</i>

01:33.961 --> 01:35.828
All right, the telegraph
is fine,

01:35.830 --> 01:37.529
but, like, what's next?

01:37.531 --> 01:39.064
<i>So, they're like,</i>

01:39.066 --> 01:40.799
We're looking for somebody
to, like, invent a way

01:40.801 --> 01:44.436
to, like, talk your voice
over a wire to some other dude.

01:44.438 --> 01:47.506
It's a wonderful thing
where you call people's homes

01:47.508 --> 01:48.740
and--it's a telephone!

01:48.742 --> 01:52.611
<i>Now, there's a dude</i>
<i>whose name is Elisha--</i>

01:52.613 --> 01:53.512
pronounced Elijah.

01:53.514 --> 01:56.215
<i>Elisha Gray</i>
<i>sold telegraph parts.</i>

01:56.217 --> 01:59.351
<i>He's like,</i> I invent
little telegraph things.

01:59.353 --> 02:02.754
Eh, I'm a cute little inventor.
I'm Elisha Gray.

02:02.756 --> 02:04.156
<i>So Western Union is like,</i>

02:04.158 --> 02:06.925
Elisha Gray,
invent the telephone.

02:06.927 --> 02:08.093
<i>Elisha Gray's like,</i>
Great.

02:08.095 --> 02:10.829
But then Western Union
goes to the public and is like,

02:10.831 --> 02:14.266
Hey, everybody--everybody
in the world who invents things,

02:14.268 --> 02:17.269
try to invent the telephone
and we'll buy it from you.

02:17.271 --> 02:21.773
<i>So this inventor</i>
<i>Alexander Graham Bell is like,</i>

Oh, [bleep],
invent the telephone?

02:25.279 --> 02:26.578
Yes, please.

We're really drunk.

[both laugh]

02:30.284 --> 02:33.085
<i>So Alexander Graham Bell</i>
<i>gets to work</i>

02:33.087 --> 02:34.186
<i>trying to invent the telephone.</i>

02:34.188 --> 02:37.122
<i>He's having a hard time.</i>
<i>He can't figure it out.</i>

02:37.124 --> 02:41.026
<i>Like</i> murp, murp.
It's kinda me talking,

02:41.028 --> 02:42.461

02:42.463 --> 02:45.197
<i>Alexander Graham Bell's</i>

This is a [bleep] telephone.

02:46.133 --> 02:48.634
You're not doing a good job
at all, Alexander Graham Bell.

02:48.636 --> 02:52.471
<i>And so his lawyer</i>
<i>goes to the patent clerk</i>

02:52.473 --> 02:54.506
<i>at the U.S. Patent Office.</i>

02:54.508 --> 02:57.709
Zenas Fisk Wilber.

02:57.711 --> 02:58.844
It's a weird, old name.

02:58.846 --> 03:02.414
Zenas rhymes with penis.

03:05.119 --> 03:06.785
<i>The guy had</i>
<i>all sorts of problems.</i>

03:06.787 --> 03:11.523
I'm poor and I'm drunk

Listen, you owe us money--

03:16.063 --> 03:16.628

03:16.630 --> 03:20.465
If anybody submits
a telephone patent, let me know.

03:20.467 --> 03:24.736
<i>Meanwhile, Elisha Gray is,</i>
<i>like, having the same problems</i>

03:24.738 --> 03:26.772
<i>Alexander Graham Bell</i>
<i>was having,</i>

03:26.774 --> 03:28.540
<i>he was like</i>
Merp, merp, merp.

03:28.542 --> 03:29.875
I'm talking on the phone.

03:29.877 --> 03:32.377
How can I make
this electric current

03:32.379 --> 03:34.279
be smoother on the other end?

03:34.281 --> 03:37.316
What if I put a little
water in the doodad?

03:37.318 --> 03:41.286
The water vibrates
at more subtler tones

03:41.288 --> 03:43.121
and that goes through the wire

03:43.123 --> 03:45.657
and it's clear as silk.
Bonanza!

03:45.659 --> 03:48.894
He goes to the Patent Office
and he files a patent.

03:48.896 --> 03:50.596
I know how to make
the telephone,

03:50.598 --> 03:52.998
and this is how
I'm gonna do it.

- Of course I swallow.

Spit it on the floor?

Well, all right, here it is.

04:36.510 --> 04:38.410
Here's the drawing
of, uh...

how he's gonna invent

04:40.047 --> 04:42.948
<i>Alexander Graham Bell</i>
<i>copies down</i>

How could he do that?
This is--I know--

04:59.767 --> 05:02.734
I made this telephone.
This is my thing.

05:02.736 --> 05:04.036
There's a "disputement."

<i>Everybody's like,</i>
who did it first?

05:07.074 --> 05:08.440
Who--who was first?

05:08.442 --> 05:11.376
<i>And guess who the Patent Office</i>
<i>put in charge</i>

05:52.086 --> 05:54.419
Listen,
I took a bunch of money

05:54.421 --> 05:57.789
from Bell's lawyer so
he could invent the telephone

05:57.791 --> 05:58.657

I'll make you my new thing,
whatever,

09:04.778 --> 09:05.677
with some handkerchiefs.

09:05.679 --> 09:08.046
Then she gets a letter
in the mail

09:08.048 --> 09:10.348
from someone she's never met
saying,

09:10.350 --> 09:14.185
"Hey, I'll give you a dollar
to make me a bra."

09:14.187 --> 09:17.923
<i>And then she realizes,</i>
Oh, this could be a business.

09:17.925 --> 09:20.659
So she goes
to the Patent Office

09:20.661 --> 09:24.996
and she said,
Hey, I've made this thing.

09:24.998 --> 09:25.997
It's a brassiere.

09:25.999 --> 09:27.499
<i>The Patent Office guy</i>
<i>was like,</i>

09:27.501 --> 09:31.002
Everyone's had boobs
for goddamn forever.

09:31.004 --> 09:34.139
I understand that you think
you made something,

09:34.141 --> 09:35.674
but you [bleep]ing didn't.

09:35.676 --> 09:37.642
<i>And she said</i>
No, I did.

09:37.644 --> 09:42.080
The last piece of [bleep]
patent flattens your tits

09:42.082 --> 09:46.284
into nothing but one boob.
Do you want one boob?

09:46.286 --> 09:48.353
<i>And he's like,</i>
I don't--I can't even--

09:48.355 --> 09:50.322
I don't even know
if I can answer this.

09:50.324 --> 09:53.892
No, you want
two [bleep]ing boobs.

09:53.894 --> 09:56.661
They separate and lift.

09:56.663 --> 10:00.298
Give me the patent
for the backless brassiere.

10:00.300 --> 10:01.967
<i>And he says,</i>
Yeah, okay, all right.

10:01.969 --> 10:04.903
I've never seen that.
I will give you a patent.

10:04.905 --> 10:07.572
<i>Slam.</i>
<i>He gives her a patent.</i>

10:07.574 --> 10:09.674
Oh, God.
I'm--

10:09.676 --> 10:11.710
I'm not gonna throw up,
but I am--

10:11.712 --> 10:14.212
I'm pretty--

10:14.214 --> 10:16.181
Gonzo bonzo.
- [laughs]

10:16.183 --> 10:20.752
<i>- So she opens the</i>
<i>Fashion Form Brassiere Company.</i>

10:20.754 --> 10:23.521
<i>Meanwhile, she marries this guy</i>
<i>Harry Crosby</i>

10:23.523 --> 10:25.223
<i>and Harry says,</i>
Hey, babe,

10:25.225 --> 10:27.058
because you're gonna be
my wife Crosby,

10:27.060 --> 10:29.494
I feel like you should have
a "C" name.

10:29.496 --> 10:31.396
And so it's like C. Crosby.

10:31.398 --> 10:33.865
I would really like it
if you change your name

10:33.867 --> 10:35.667
to Clitoris.
- [laughs]

10:35.669 --> 10:38.403
- It's [bleep]ing true.
- [laughs]

10:38.405 --> 10:40.138
<i>- And she says</i>
Na--what? No.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.207
I'm not gonna
change my name to Clitoris.

10:42.209 --> 10:44.275
<i>And he's like</i>
No, it's with a "Y".

10:44.277 --> 10:47.412
Still, I'm sorry.
I love you, man,

10:47.414 --> 10:50.415
honey, but...
not even with a "Y"

10:50.417 --> 10:52.283
will I name myself
Clitoris.

10:52.285 --> 10:53.618
What about Caresse?

10:53.620 --> 10:56.187
That's better than
Clitoris.

10:56.189 --> 10:57.188
Certainly.

10:57.190 --> 10:59.491
<i>He says to her</i>
Hey, Caresse--

10:59.493 --> 11:00.558
Car--she's now Caresse.

11:00.560 --> 11:03.628
You're kinda bored
with the bra business

11:03.630 --> 11:05.163
and it's not taking off.

11:05.165 --> 11:08.767
I'm kinda rich.
Why don't you just let it go?

11:08.769 --> 11:11.102
<i>She says</i>
All right, fine.

11:11.104 --> 11:13.304
<i>She sells her patent</i>

11:21.648 --> 11:24.015
So, wait.
I have to fast-forward.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.350
I also have to pee.

11:25.352 --> 11:26.551
- Which one you done do first?

11:26.553 --> 11:29.020
- No, I have to pee.
- Okay, well, then pee.

- I-- [laughs]

11:50.110 --> 11:51.676

Mary Phelps Jacob.
She never give a [bleep].

Oh, okay.

Not gonna dwell on it.

12:00.353 --> 12:01.820
I'm gonna open
a publishing company

12:01.822 --> 12:06.091

on an iPhone.

12:13.967 --> 12:15.066
You'll see.
- [laughs]

12:15.068 --> 12:18.570
- Then was writing pornography

12:18.572 --> 12:19.904

12:19.906 --> 12:21.673

12:21.675 --> 12:23.108
<i>And at the end of her life,</i>

12:23.110 --> 12:24.609
<i>someone asked her about,</i>
<i>like,</i>

12:24.611 --> 12:27.645

you invented something.

12:27.647 --> 12:30.782
<i>And she said</i>
Yeah, yeah.

12:30.784 --> 12:34.018
My invention--
it wouldn't take the place

12:34.020 --> 12:37.422
in history of something
like the steamboat,

12:37.424 --> 12:40.859
but, yeah...
I invented the bra.

12:40.861 --> 12:45.196
The bra is kind of
a big [bleep]ing deal.

12:45.198 --> 12:47.766
No one gives a [bleep]
about a steamboat.

12:47.768 --> 12:51.870
Do you know anyone
who doesn't have a bra?

12:52.371 --> 12:54.706
I do love bras.
- I can see.

12:54.708 --> 12:56.641
You have lots of--
- More than steamboats.

12:56.643 --> 12:58.643
- Sorry, bras.
[sneezes]

12:58.645 --> 12:59.911
I'm allergic.
- You're allergic?

12:59.913 --> 13:02.847

I didn't want to tell you.

that Edison

13:14.694 --> 13:16.594
made the movie camera?
- I knew that.

13:16.596 --> 13:18.329
- Yeah.
- But it was one of those things

13:18.331 --> 13:20.465

13:20.467 --> 13:21.966

13:25.205 --> 13:26.337
- Yeah. Yeah.
- You know?

13:26.339 --> 13:28.173
That kinda thing.
- Yeah. And I always say,

13:28.175 --> 13:30.475
every invention
that comes out now,

13:30.477 --> 13:33.077
is just one more step

Good day.

14:18.391 --> 14:20.258
My name is Duncan Trussell...

14:24.598 --> 14:25.363
<i>[cheerful music]</i>

14:25.365 --> 14:29.601
<i>This story starts in</i>
<i>New Jersey with Thomas Edison.</i>

14:29.603 --> 14:31.603
<i>One of the great</i>
<i>inventors of the time.</i>

14:31.605 --> 14:33.238
Known as
"The Wizard of Menlo Park."

<i>and he's like</i>
Just make stuff for me.

14:38.645 --> 14:41.512
If it's good I'm gonna say
it's mine. Whatever.

14:41.514 --> 14:43.815
You're gonna make money,
so just do it.

14:43.817 --> 14:46.417
<i>An inventor</i>
<i>by the name of Muybridge</i>

14:46.419 --> 14:50.388
<i>came to New Jersey,</i>
<i>shows this incredible device.</i>

14:50.390 --> 14:52.657
<i>He managed to take</i>
<i>a bunch of pictures</i>

14:52.659 --> 14:56.461
<i>of a horse running</i>
<i>and spin them on a cylinder</i>

14:56.463 --> 14:58.162
<i>in a way</i>
<i>that gave it animation.</i>

14:58.164 --> 15:00.999
<i>And Edison's like</i>
You know, great.

15:01.001 --> 15:03.167
A hor--a horse...
running.

15:03.169 --> 15:05.536
[chuckles]
Cool invention or whatever. Bye.

15:05.538 --> 15:07.505
<i>And then he's like</i>
We gotta [bleep]ing

15:07.507 --> 15:10.208
figure this [bleep] out
because people are gonna

15:10.210 --> 15:11.242
wanna watch this stuff.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.344
We gotta start working
on this [bleep]...

15:13.346 --> 15:16.214
right [bleep]ing now.

15:16.216 --> 15:19.150
And then in 1893
Edison is like

15:19.152 --> 15:21.853
I figured out how to do it,
guys!

15:21.855 --> 15:23.721
I can--I can photograph

15:23.723 --> 15:25.924
and make a movie.
We can make movies now.

15:25.926 --> 15:29.160
I came up with the very first
camera, the Kinetograph

15:29.162 --> 15:31.362
and I figured out a way
to look at the strings

15:31.364 --> 15:33.831
of moving pictures--
a Kinetoscope,

15:33.833 --> 15:36.868
and it's all my idea.
My idea!

15:36.870 --> 15:38.937
He has people--
[laughing]

15:38.939 --> 15:41.005
I'm too drunk.

15:41.907 --> 15:43.241
Why would I take another drink?

15:43.243 --> 15:47.011
<i>So Edison needed content</i>
<i>for his Kinetoscopes</i>

15:47.013 --> 15:49.781
<i>and everything he was putting</i>
<i>out was [bleep].</i>

15:49.783 --> 15:52.784
<i>He's like</i> Let's get
[bleep]ing cats boxing, man,

15:52.786 --> 15:55.653
and then vaudeville scenes,
people chasing each other.

15:55.655 --> 16:00.291
Let's film a blacksmith's shop.
Everyone's gonna wanna see that.

16:00.293 --> 16:03.328
Right, guys?
Right? Right!

16:03.330 --> 16:04.295
<i>And they filmed it.</i>

16:04.297 --> 16:06.631
People were into it, man.
Freaking out.

16:06.633 --> 16:09.100
<i>Everyone's like</i> Have you been
to the Kinetoscope parlor?

16:09.102 --> 16:11.235
Oh, you've got to go.
It's incredible!

16:11.237 --> 16:13.404
<i>So people came to Edison,</i>
<i>they're like</i>

16:13.406 --> 16:14.305
Hey, look what we can do.

16:14.307 --> 16:15.506
We can project images
on the screen.

16:15.508 --> 16:16.808
<i>He's like</i>
Wow. That's amazing.

16:16.810 --> 16:18.042
I can't believe
I invented that.

16:18.044 --> 16:21.379
That's incredible.
I am so [bleep]ing smart!

16:21.381 --> 16:22.714
Let's patent this [bleep].

16:22.716 --> 16:24.749
<i>Movies take off.</i>
<i>People love it.</i>

16:24.751 --> 16:27.085
<i>They went to these places</i>
<i>called nickelodeons.</i>

16:27.087 --> 16:29.520
For a nickel
you're in a Greek theatre.

16:29.522 --> 16:30.188
Come on in!

16:30.190 --> 16:32.256
<i>People would sit in those</i>
<i>theatres and be like</i>

16:32.258 --> 16:33.358
This is awesome.

16:33.360 --> 16:36.160
<i>So then Edison creates</i>
<i>an industry town</i>

16:36.162 --> 16:39.964
<i>and everyone comes to Fort Lee</i>
<i>to start making movies</i>

16:39.966 --> 16:41.899
and Edison squeezes
all of them.

16:41.901 --> 16:44.369
<i>He was like</i>
Join me in what we're gonna call

16:44.371 --> 16:46.571
The Edison Trust
and all of you assholes

16:46.573 --> 16:49.207
can join together with me
and we're gonna make it so that

16:49.209 --> 16:52.710
no other mother[bleep]ers
make movies except us.

16:52.712 --> 16:55.747
Got it?
Write it down in your notebook.

16:55.749 --> 16:57.248
<i>And everyone's like</i>
Great, let's do it.

16:57.250 --> 16:59.083
I don't want you to sue me,
so I'll just agree

16:59.085 --> 17:01.185
to whatever you say
because you're super-rich

17:01.187 --> 17:04.889
and I just wanna make art.
So, great.

17:04.891 --> 17:06.090
Sounds good.

17:06.092 --> 17:08.526
They created a monopoly
on all filmmaking.

17:08.528 --> 17:11.462
<i>There was a--a fellow</i>
<i>by the name of Carl Laemmle.</i>

17:11.464 --> 17:13.965

17:16.169 --> 17:19.570
People are paying a nickel

17:19.572 --> 17:22.306
Why don't we try to make
our own movies?

17:22.308 --> 17:24.942
<i>And so Carl Laemmle</i>
<i>starts making movies.</i>

17:24.944 --> 17:28.880
<i>He creates his own theatre</i>
<i>and Edison's like</i>

17:28.882 --> 17:30.548
No. No.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.250
I'm sorry, you--
what are you doing?

17:32.252 --> 17:35.286
You're not allowed to...
make movies.

17:35.288 --> 17:37.622
And you're definitely
not allowed to show movies

17:37.624 --> 17:40.191
on my [bleep]ing equipment
without paying me

17:40.193 --> 17:42.260
a [bleep]ing licensing fee.

17:42.262 --> 17:43.895
How dare you?

17:51.237 --> 17:53.237
I just wanna one day
make enough money

17:53.239 --> 17:55.773
to take my family
on a vacation in Europe.

17:55.775 --> 17:56.574
<i>And Edison is like</i>

I'm The Wizard

Oh, God, he was just--

18:08.388 --> 18:10.855
he was just eating a turd
in the yard.

18:10.857 --> 18:12.223
- [laughs]

18:14.960 --> 18:17.795
- Elon Musk, he's doing
the opposite of what Edison did.

18:17.797 --> 18:19.397
He's giving away his patents

18:19.399 --> 18:21.966
and it's no accident
that Elon Musk's company

18:21.968 --> 18:24.068
is named after the guy
that Edison f--

18:24.070 --> 18:26.003

mouth [bleep]ed.

18:26.005 --> 18:28.739

Imagine[bleep] you.s, man.

18:33.980 --> 18:36.013
I'm gonna keep making
these movies.

18:36.015 --> 18:38.783
<i>And Edison,</i>
<i>faced with true opposition,</i>

18:38.785 --> 18:42.153
started sending thugs
to Leammle's movie theatres.

18:42.155 --> 18:44.355
<i>People were just sitting</i>

18:44.357 --> 18:47.158

<i>Edison thugs would come</i>

18:47.160 --> 18:48.659
<i>crashing through the door</i>
<i>and be like</i>

18:48.661 --> 18:52.430
[bleep] off!
No one's watching this [bleep]!

18:52.432 --> 18:54.365
This is not an Edison film!

18:54.367 --> 18:56.234
<i>They would</i>
<i>go to the productions,</i>

18:56.236 --> 18:57.969
<i>beat up the [bleep]ing actors,</i>

18:57.971 --> 18:59.871
but Laemmle didn't back down.

18:59.873 --> 19:02.006
There's three guys
who kept making movies.

19:02.008 --> 19:06.077
<i>Laemmle, Fox, and Zukor,</i>
<i>and finally they realized,</i>

19:06.079 --> 19:08.179
What the [bleep]
are we doing in New Jersey?

19:08.181 --> 19:11.082
We're shooting films
in New Jersey

19:11.084 --> 19:14.886
and on a daily basis
getting sued and beaten up.

19:14.888 --> 19:17.121
Let's get the [bleep]
outta New Jersey.

19:17.123 --> 19:19.590
How about we go to
[bleep]ing Los Angeles

19:19.592 --> 19:21.125
where it's sunny all the time

19:21.127 --> 19:24.028
and you don't get
your ass kicked by a dick.

19:24.030 --> 19:25.663
That's--
[laughs]

19:25.665 --> 19:27.965
That makes great sense.

Uh, sorry, Edison,
you can't have control

19:49.556 --> 19:52.356
over all film being made

19:52.358 --> 19:54.992

19:59.098 --> 20:01.165

you greedy, reptilian

20:04.571 --> 20:07.104
Still people are gonna think
you're great, though.

I'm not saying inventors
don't--don't deserve to be

rewarded for their inventions,
but instead of suing people,

20:19.786 --> 20:22.620
you work with them
and then the end result of that

20:22.622 --> 20:24.222
is the entire planet
wakes up,

20:24.224 --> 20:26.591
we experience what's called
the singularity,

everybody gets dissolved

20:28.895 --> 20:30.628
