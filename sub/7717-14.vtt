WEBVTT

00:01.568 --> 00:04.003
- Have you seen darryl?
- He's around here somewhere.

00:04.005 --> 00:07.339
- Hmm.

00:07.341 --> 00:08.340
Yeah, darryl's here.

00:08.342 --> 00:09.608
So is santa claus.

00:09.610 --> 00:12.277
It's just a regular Thursday.

00:12.279 --> 00:13.645
Neither guy is here.

00:13.647 --> 00:15.180
And it's Friday.

00:15.182 --> 00:19.184
Welcome to me and darryl's
world of lies.

00:19.186 --> 00:20.786
Nobody knows it yet,

00:20.788 --> 00:22.654
But darryl already
started working in philly.

00:22.656 --> 00:25.324
So now he has to sneak
out of here

00:25.326 --> 00:27.626
Like the sneakiest
little sneaky sneak

00:27.628 --> 00:30.029
You ever saw.

00:30.031 --> 00:32.598
And I'm his helper.

00:32.600 --> 00:36.201
It's so fun.

00:36.203 --> 00:39.171
Darryl, meet bear-yl.

00:39.173 --> 00:40.506
- How much did you pay
for that?

00:40.508 --> 00:42.808
- Nothing.
Won him at the carnival.

00:42.810 --> 00:44.143
Spent a ton on tickets,
though.

00:44.145 --> 00:45.477
Drive safe.

00:45.479 --> 00:47.346
- Everybody knows
I go to philly.

00:47.348 --> 00:49.681
I've just been using sick days
I saved up.

00:49.683 --> 00:53.352
But erin was so excited
about being sneaky sneaks,

00:53.354 --> 00:54.720
I went along with it.

00:54.722 --> 00:56.255
- [laughs]

00:56.257 --> 00:58.457
Darryl, you are too much.

00:58.459 --> 00:59.658
That guy's hilarious.

00:59.660 --> 01:04.663
He's here today.

01:04.665 --> 01:08.734
[cheerful music]

01:08.736 --> 01:14.273
â™ª

01:14.275 --> 01:16.075
- I've really been putting
in the hours

01:16.077 --> 01:17.242
On this mural.

01:17.244 --> 01:18.844
And my boss
is totally okay with it,

01:18.846 --> 01:20.212
Because he's in the bahamas

01:20.214 --> 01:23.315
And has no clue
what anybody's doing.

01:23.317 --> 01:25.451
I'm usually very self-critical.
I hate what I paint.

01:25.453 --> 01:27.553
But I don't know.
This time I feel

01:27.555 --> 01:29.788
Like it's--
it's really coming together.

01:29.790 --> 01:32.224
Oh, my god.

01:32.226 --> 01:34.259
What?
You've got to be kidding me.

01:34.261 --> 01:37.596
What--are those--
are those butts?

01:37.598 --> 01:39.198
Huh?

01:39.200 --> 01:40.766
No way.

01:40.768 --> 01:42.768
No way.

01:42.770 --> 01:45.237
- Excuse me, everyone.

01:45.239 --> 01:48.674
Is it okay if I leave early
from work today?

01:48.676 --> 01:50.342
It's phillip's first birthday,

01:50.344 --> 01:51.410
And the senator and I
are hosting

01:51.412 --> 01:52.711
A party at our house.

01:52.713 --> 01:54.746
- Oh, cute, so there'll
be a bunch of kids.

01:54.748 --> 01:56.281
- No.
No children.

01:56.283 --> 01:57.783
Our house is not kid-friendly.

01:57.785 --> 02:02.454
Most of our furniture is sharp.
Also ew.

02:02.456 --> 02:05.290
It will mostly be
campaign donors.

02:05.292 --> 02:08.827
- Angela, I am prepared
to donate

02:08.829 --> 02:14.133
A whopping $8
to lipton for america

02:14.135 --> 02:16.168
To have an invitation--
- no, no, please.

02:16.170 --> 02:19.171
You know, actually none of you
could even really make the cut

02:19.173 --> 02:20.272
For this thing.

02:20.274 --> 02:24.776
Which I am so sad about.

02:24.778 --> 02:26.812
- Angela.

02:26.814 --> 02:28.780
You're going to find out,
so I thought

02:28.782 --> 02:33.785
I'd let you know
that robert invited me too.

02:33.787 --> 02:36.221
- What?
- He said he wanted me there

02:36.223 --> 02:37.689
For support.
- I'm...

02:37.691 --> 02:40.292
His wife.

02:40.294 --> 02:42.494
- Angela's husband
and I are in love,

02:42.496 --> 02:44.329
But as a politician
in this town

02:44.331 --> 02:46.398
You still need
the conventional blonde wife

02:46.400 --> 02:48.167
On your lawn signs.

02:48.169 --> 02:53.172
He is risking everything
to have me there today.

02:53.174 --> 02:54.540
Me.

02:54.542 --> 02:56.775
- We agreed
that you wouldn't be seen

02:56.777 --> 02:59.211
With him in public.

02:59.213 --> 03:01.380
It's humiliating
for me.

03:01.382 --> 03:04.917
Well, if you get
to bring a stud,

03:04.919 --> 03:06.752
Maybe I do too.

03:10.724 --> 03:14.326
We are splitting a sublet
on a place near philly.

03:14.328 --> 03:17.229
- Just a couple
of grown, sexy ass roommates.

03:17.231 --> 03:18.564
- And, as much as I miss
pam and the kids,

03:18.566 --> 03:20.399
It's kind of nice
to live the bachelor life again.

03:20.401 --> 03:21.667
You know, let your hair down.

03:21.669 --> 03:24.369
- Jim was nice enough
to give me his bedroom.

03:24.371 --> 03:25.571
- I'm couching it.

03:25.573 --> 03:27.339
- Which usually means
there are clothes

03:27.341 --> 03:28.941
All over the living room.

03:28.943 --> 03:30.542
- And this dude
labels his food.

03:30.544 --> 03:33.378
He's the clean one.
I'm the messy one.

03:33.380 --> 03:34.813
How much fun is this?

03:37.217 --> 03:39.218
- I love jim.
I love that he hooked me up

03:39.220 --> 03:40.385
With a job.

03:40.387 --> 03:42.688
It's just he uses
old t-shirts

03:42.690 --> 03:44.423
As wash rags.

03:44.425 --> 03:45.691
He doesn't wash his dishes.

03:45.693 --> 03:49.962
Apparently,
they need to "soak."

03:49.964 --> 03:51.863
He hooked me up
with a job.

03:51.865 --> 03:55.534
[cherry picker whirring]

03:55.536 --> 03:56.768
- Attention, everyone.

03:56.770 --> 03:58.237
Can I have your attention,
please?

03:58.239 --> 04:01.006
Yeah, I don't know
everybody's name down here,

04:01.008 --> 04:03.342
But, whoever did this,
will you please raise your hand?

04:06.613 --> 04:08.780
Hello?

04:08.782 --> 04:11.016
This is not over.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.484
Okay?

04:12.486 --> 04:15.487
I will stay up here all day
if I have to.

04:15.489 --> 04:19.024
Is that what you want?

04:27.734 --> 04:29.468
Yeah, I will also come down
if I want to.

04:29.470 --> 04:31.770
It's my choice.

04:31.772 --> 04:34.273
I don't demand justice often.

04:34.275 --> 04:35.607
I'm not like angela

04:35.609 --> 04:37.342
Who calls a lawyer
every time someone watches

04:37.344 --> 04:38.910
A youtube video of animals
doing it,

04:38.912 --> 04:41.613
But someone should get fired
over this, right?

04:41.615 --> 04:44.816
Val's no help.
Andy's gone. Jim's out.

04:44.818 --> 04:49.488
I just feel
like I'm on my own here.

04:49.490 --> 04:52.291
I mean, okay,
not completely on my own,

04:52.293 --> 04:54.326
But in terms of people
who can do something.

04:54.328 --> 04:57.462
Thank you, brian.
[exhales]

04:59.532 --> 05:01.366
- Hey, so wade wants to send
people to the sloan conference.

05:01.368 --> 05:03.035
We got to compile a list
of our target clients.

05:03.037 --> 05:05.437
- Already on it.

05:05.439 --> 05:07.472
I ordered them
by their google trend ranking

05:07.474 --> 05:08.840
So we know
who to hit first.

05:08.842 --> 05:10.776
- Who is this guy?
We are killing it.

05:10.778 --> 05:13.078
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah.

05:19.986 --> 05:23.555
- Conference room,
everybody, now.

05:23.557 --> 05:24.623
- You don't have the clearance

05:24.625 --> 05:26.525
To call
a conference room meeting.

05:26.527 --> 05:27.626
- Yes, but david wallace does,

05:27.628 --> 05:28.960
And he asked me
to gather everyone

05:28.962 --> 05:31.697
To talk about stuff
that's gonna be revealed

05:31.699 --> 05:33.065
Once we're in the conference
room for the meeting.

05:33.067 --> 05:36.068
- You're telling me
david wallace asked you

05:36.070 --> 05:37.436
To call a super-secret

05:37.438 --> 05:38.804
Classified conference room
meeting?

05:38.806 --> 05:41.606
- Yeah.

05:41.608 --> 05:45.510
Super-secret classified
conference room meeting now.

05:46.646 --> 05:48.747
- Let's go.

05:48.749 --> 05:51.550
- I have terrible news.

05:51.552 --> 05:52.951
Someone defaced my mural.

05:52.953 --> 05:55.620
They painted all over it.

05:55.622 --> 05:57.622
- I thought
that's what you were doing.

05:57.624 --> 06:01.126
- Oh. They used worse paint
than your paint.

06:01.128 --> 06:03.562
- I don't think so,
but they put paint

06:03.564 --> 06:06.598
- I thought you wanted paint
on the whole thing.

06:06.600 --> 06:09.668
- Different-colored paint.
I wanted different-colored paint

06:09.670 --> 06:10.869
In the spots where they put
their paints,

06:10.871 --> 06:12.704
So it just is--okay.

06:12.706 --> 06:15.540
The point is these
warehouse guys are vandals,

06:15.542 --> 06:17.376
And they need to be stopped.

06:17.378 --> 06:19.678
- Yeah, and somebody had
the balls to put my phone number

06:19.680 --> 06:21.713
On the men's room wall,
which is so messed up.

06:21.715 --> 06:25.016
It's 6782, not 83.

06:25.018 --> 06:28.720
- Uh, 6783's also a good time,
less mileage.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.021
- Pam, what can be done?

06:30.023 --> 06:32.691
- Yes, thank you.
Let's answer that question.

06:32.693 --> 06:34.760
- I was politely saying
nothing can be done.

06:34.762 --> 06:37.496
I thought I was clear.
- What?

06:37.498 --> 06:38.830
Come on, guys,
we need to figure out

06:38.832 --> 06:40.699
Who did this
and punish them.

06:40.701 --> 06:42.434
This isn't just about me.

06:42.436 --> 06:44.403
This is about all of us.

06:44.405 --> 06:48.940
Don't you see
how much we worked on this?

06:48.942 --> 06:50.642
How much time and energy?

06:50.644 --> 06:52.911
We put our heart
and soul into this thing.

06:52.913 --> 06:54.613
- David wallace
called this meeting?

06:54.615 --> 06:56.715
- Sure did.
I was as surprised as you,

06:56.717 --> 06:59.751
But apparently he is very
passionate about public art.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.820
[overlapping groans]

07:01.822 --> 07:04.089
No, no, come on, guys.
Don't go.

07:04.091 --> 07:06.992
- Pam, I'll help you.
- You will?

07:06.994 --> 07:08.560
- If there's anything
I hate worse than art,

07:08.562 --> 07:09.995
It's crime.

07:09.997 --> 07:11.797
- Thank you?
- I am in too, pam.

07:11.799 --> 07:13.498
- Yeah?
- Yes, of course.

07:13.500 --> 07:15.834
I believe in you.
I believe in your art.

07:15.836 --> 07:19.070
And I am bored.
- Great.

07:19.072 --> 07:20.605
I was hoping
for a righteous mob.

07:20.607 --> 07:22.874
I ended up
with dwight and nellie.

07:22.876 --> 07:24.976
But they both have
a mob mentality,

07:24.978 --> 07:29.014
And I'm pretty sure dwight
has a pitchfork in his car.

07:29.016 --> 07:32.584
- You need my pitchfork?

07:32.586 --> 07:34.052
- [exhales]

07:34.054 --> 07:36.688
- Hey.
- What is it?

07:36.690 --> 07:37.856
I have vengeance to exact.

07:37.858 --> 07:39.891
- Exciting news.
There's room for one more

07:39.893 --> 07:41.560
At my son's birthday event,

07:41.562 --> 07:44.629
And I want you.
- I'm not interested.

07:44.631 --> 07:46.898
- But, wait, the state
transportation secretary

07:46.900 --> 07:47.966
Will be there.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.668
You could sell
your beet salt idea

07:49.670 --> 07:53.104
- If I get the deicing gig,
it's gonna be on merit,

07:53.106 --> 07:55.006
Not because I played politics.

07:56.843 --> 08:00.145
- Hey, so a little birdie
just told me

08:00.147 --> 08:02.647
That dwight can't come
to your son's birthday.

08:02.649 --> 08:04.883
So do you want me
to go with you?

08:04.885 --> 08:06.818
- No.
- Okay, I understand.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.487
I'll just stay here then,

08:08.489 --> 08:10.589
Alone with the money.

08:10.591 --> 08:13.258
- Oh, crap.

08:14.260 --> 08:16.061
- I am handing out pieces
of paper

08:16.063 --> 08:18.964
On which you will draw
one human butt.

08:18.966 --> 08:20.232
What I do with said drawings

08:20.234 --> 08:21.900
Is no one's business
but my own.

08:21.902 --> 08:24.236
- You're gonna compare 'em
to the butts up there.

08:24.238 --> 08:25.871
- Incorrect.
It is my fetish.

08:25.873 --> 08:27.138
Oh, also sign them.

08:27.140 --> 08:29.207
My fetish
is signed drawings of butts.

08:29.209 --> 08:30.809
- I'm not drawing a butt.

08:30.811 --> 08:32.744
- All right,
then no bottoms.

08:32.746 --> 08:36.248
We should ask you
to do big rounded ws.

08:36.250 --> 08:37.949
- Yes.
Or nipple-less breasts.

08:37.951 --> 08:40.018
- Okay, okay, I think it's time
to get back to work.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.186
Come on, fellas.
Let's go.

08:41.188 --> 08:42.554
- Or melons
like cantaloupes

08:42.556 --> 08:44.723
With the halves are cut off

08:44.725 --> 08:46.725
And then just the bottom parts.

08:46.727 --> 08:48.560
- Well, this is getting us
nowhere.

08:48.562 --> 08:50.161
- We need another approach.

08:50.163 --> 08:52.898
We need to find
the weakest one

08:52.900 --> 08:55.901
And separate him from the group.

08:55.903 --> 08:58.069
Yeah, I think,
if we could get nate alone,

08:58.071 --> 09:00.639
We could crack him.

09:00.641 --> 09:01.907
- We just need
a pretense to talk to him.

09:01.909 --> 09:03.975
We could tell him
that his mother is dying.

09:03.977 --> 09:05.176
That usually works on him.

09:05.178 --> 09:06.845
- Nate!

09:06.847 --> 09:10.682
Your mother is dying.

09:15.656 --> 09:17.889
- It's all right.
It's all right.

09:17.891 --> 09:21.126
- So she's gonna pull through
again?

09:21.128 --> 09:23.695
That's great.
Can I talk to her?

09:23.697 --> 09:27.566
- Now, listen,
now that we have got you here,

09:27.568 --> 09:29.234
Let's talk
about this mural business.

09:29.236 --> 09:33.605
Now I know a lot of these
warehouse guys are your friends,

09:33.607 --> 09:35.707
But we've got
chewing gum.

09:35.709 --> 09:38.743
- Gum's gotten mintier lately.
Have you noticed?

09:38.745 --> 09:41.112
Like, some of it's
just too minty.

09:41.114 --> 09:42.948
It's like they're literally
trying to hurt your--

09:42.950 --> 09:44.683
- Tell us who defaced the mural.

09:44.685 --> 09:48.620
- He did it.

09:48.622 --> 09:51.690
- All right. You can go.
Give him his gum.

09:51.692 --> 09:53.658
- There's no gum.
There never was any gum.

09:53.660 --> 09:57.662
- Wow, that's really rude.

09:57.664 --> 10:01.800
[indistinct chatter,
soft piano music]

10:01.802 --> 10:04.069
- Opening with puff pastries?

10:04.071 --> 10:05.604
That's a bold play.

10:05.606 --> 10:08.773
They're saying it's only
gonna get better from here?

10:08.775 --> 10:11.943
Good luck.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.945
- That painting is just...

10:13.947 --> 10:16.147
How can anyone that weighs less
than a guinea hen

10:16.149 --> 10:17.649
Be so terrifying?

10:17.651 --> 10:18.984
- Ladies and gentlemen,

10:18.986 --> 10:21.186
Senator and angela lipton.

10:21.188 --> 10:22.687
[applause]

10:22.689 --> 10:24.322
- Thanks, everybody.
Thanks for coming.

10:24.324 --> 10:26.958
Phillip had no idea
he was so popular.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.661
[laughter]

10:29.663 --> 10:32.197
- Oh, robert,
you're horrible.

10:32.199 --> 10:34.065
Simon, maxine,
who let you guys in here?

10:34.067 --> 10:36.034
[laughter]

10:36.036 --> 10:38.737
- This is the team.

10:38.739 --> 10:42.173
- Nice job, man.
- You too, darryl.

10:42.175 --> 10:45.010
- What?

10:45.012 --> 10:47.145
Oh, man.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.647
I'm sorry about that.

10:48.649 --> 10:50.682
- It's cool.
Reading's tricky sometimes.

10:50.684 --> 10:53.418
- Oh.
Are you really mad about this?

10:53.420 --> 10:56.287
- That's my go-to thermos,
that's all.

10:56.289 --> 10:58.223
- Oh.
It's your go-to--

10:58.225 --> 10:59.724
Oh, man,
that's a bummer.

10:59.726 --> 11:00.925
I'm sorry about that.
- No big deal.

11:00.927 --> 11:01.993
No big deal.
- No, no, if it's a big deal,

11:01.995 --> 11:03.895
It's a big deal.
No big deal.

11:03.897 --> 11:05.664
- No, no, no, no,
you don't have to do that.

11:05.666 --> 11:09.367
- Honestly, I don't mind.

11:19.111 --> 11:20.679
Did you want me
to wash it for you?

11:20.681 --> 11:22.213
- I don't know.
Are you gonna wash it,

11:22.215 --> 11:23.848
Or are you gonna let it soak?

11:27.720 --> 11:29.754
- Okay.

11:29.756 --> 11:30.855
[picks up piece of paper]

11:30.857 --> 11:32.257
Here you go.

11:32.259 --> 11:33.992
- Thank you.

11:36.062 --> 11:37.162
- So, frank,
do you have any thoughts

11:37.164 --> 11:42.233
About what was done?
By you?

11:42.235 --> 11:44.402
- Maybe--maybe I could get
the ball rolling.

11:44.404 --> 11:46.705
Frank?

11:46.707 --> 11:47.939
Hi.

11:47.941 --> 11:49.941
Pam.
I am so sorry

11:49.943 --> 11:53.111
If I've done anything

11:53.113 --> 11:54.713
To offend you.

11:54.715 --> 11:56.981
I'm sure it isn't easy
for you guys

11:56.983 --> 12:00.719
To have an upstairs person
coming down in your space.

12:00.721 --> 12:04.255
So truly I apologize.

12:04.257 --> 12:06.157
But enough about me.

12:06.159 --> 12:09.260
Your turn.

12:12.765 --> 12:16.434
- Insert apology here, frank?

12:16.436 --> 12:19.370
- I'm sorry I didn't like
your crappy doodles.

12:19.372 --> 12:21.439
I drew a butt.

12:21.441 --> 12:23.274
Big deal.
Butts are funny.

12:23.276 --> 12:25.977
- Well, I didn't think
that butt was funny.

12:25.979 --> 12:27.412
- Well, maybe if you got
the stick out of yours.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.447
- What was that?
- You know what?

12:29.449 --> 12:31.416
You people can't fire me,

12:31.418 --> 12:33.518
So screw you.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.754
[an object falls]

12:35.756 --> 12:37.522
- Whoa.

12:37.524 --> 12:39.424
Hey, that is not okay.

12:39.426 --> 12:40.959
What are you gonna do
about that?

12:40.961 --> 12:43.328
- [speaks indistinctly]

12:43.330 --> 12:45.196
- The first sorry
sounded sincere.

12:45.198 --> 12:47.098
- There were
two or three sorries in there.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.400
- Mm, that's quite a lot.
- It's a lot.

12:49.402 --> 12:52.036
- That sucked.

12:52.038 --> 12:54.305
He didn't apologize.
There's no talking to that guy.

12:54.307 --> 12:56.508
- Oh, your little feelings party
didn't work out, huh?

12:56.510 --> 12:58.910
Who won the hugging contest?
No, let me guess.

12:58.912 --> 13:00.478
Everyone tied for first.

13:00.480 --> 13:01.780
- We should just take him down.

13:01.782 --> 13:04.315
- Wait.
Are you saying...

13:04.317 --> 13:06.551
- I'm saying we should go
scorched earth

13:06.553 --> 13:10.321
On that guy's face.

13:10.323 --> 13:12.490
- Normally I find pam
to be a comforting

13:12.492 --> 13:14.159
If unarousing presence
around the office.

13:14.161 --> 13:16.528
Like a well-watered fern.

13:16.530 --> 13:20.532
But today she has tapped into
this vengeful violent side,

13:20.534 --> 13:26.037
And I'm like, wow,
pam has kind of a good butt.

13:26.039 --> 13:28.373
He messed with something
that was important to you.

13:28.375 --> 13:30.275
We need to mess with something
that's important to him.

13:30.277 --> 13:32.544
A little eye-for-an-eye action.
- Yes, yes.

13:32.546 --> 13:34.512
- Go all hammurabi
on this clown.

13:34.514 --> 13:36.548
- We need an infiltrator.

13:38.017 --> 13:43.188
- I know just the man
for the job.

13:43.190 --> 13:45.056
- Clark?

13:45.058 --> 13:47.425
- He even looks
like a mole.

13:47.427 --> 13:50.261
- One of his tee shots can wipe
out a whole owl population.

13:50.263 --> 13:52.197
[laughter]

13:52.199 --> 13:54.499
- You two seem very close.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.568
- Yes, we're good friends.
Good friends.

13:56.570 --> 13:58.436
- Yeah.
- And I suppose that may ruffle

13:58.438 --> 14:01.072
A few feathers,
because for a long time

14:01.074 --> 14:06.311
Our party has turned its back
on the hispanic people.

14:06.313 --> 14:07.545
Well, that is not who I am.

14:07.547 --> 14:10.949
I am a friend
of the latino community.

14:10.951 --> 14:12.383
And, if you ask me,

14:12.385 --> 14:15.186
It's time that we bid bigotry

14:15.188 --> 14:16.454
<i>Hasta luego.</i>

14:16.456 --> 14:19.958
Now does my embrace of hispanics

14:19.960 --> 14:22.293
Make me more electable?

14:22.295 --> 14:24.062
Given demographic trends,
I don't know.

14:24.064 --> 14:25.196
And I don't care.

14:25.198 --> 14:28.299
What I care about is oscar.

14:28.301 --> 14:31.636
My friend.
<i>Mi amigo</i> oscar.

14:31.638 --> 14:34.105
[applause]

14:34.107 --> 14:38.409
- Maybe I should be insulted
that he only invited me here

14:38.411 --> 14:40.178
To be his token mexican friend,

14:40.180 --> 14:41.479
But he could have invited

14:41.481 --> 14:43.882
Any number of hispanics
that he knows--

14:43.884 --> 14:46.217
His gardener rohelio,

14:46.219 --> 14:48.319
Or he could have invited...

14:48.321 --> 14:49.554
Rohelio.

14:49.556 --> 14:53.057
But he chose me.

14:53.059 --> 14:56.394
Rohelio's malaysian.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.563
The son of a bitch
is malaysian.

15:04.169 --> 15:05.503
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

15:05.505 --> 15:07.605
- Hey, I usually watch tv
during my lunch break.

15:07.607 --> 15:09.440
It's cool?
- Yeah, cool.

15:14.980 --> 15:17.682
It's mine.
Don't worry.

15:17.684 --> 15:19.417
- I didn't say anything.

15:19.419 --> 15:20.618
- I don't think you had to.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.387
- Excuse me?

15:22.389 --> 15:24.055
- I think you might be going
a little crazy

15:24.057 --> 15:25.957
With this labeling thing, man.

15:25.959 --> 15:29.494
I mean, you put your name
on a five-pound bag of flour.

15:29.496 --> 15:31.429
Are you honestly saying that,
if I needed flour,

15:31.431 --> 15:32.497
I couldn't use that?

15:32.499 --> 15:33.665
- What you need flour for, jim?

15:33.667 --> 15:35.300
- That's not the point.

15:35.302 --> 15:37.468
- What you making, bread?
- No, I'm not making bread.

15:37.470 --> 15:39.203
- What kind of bread you making?
Pumpernickel?

15:39.205 --> 15:40.538
- It doesn't matter.
Darryl, I think you know

15:40.540 --> 15:43.374
The point I'm trying to make.

15:43.376 --> 15:46.210
- All right, I'm being a jerk.

15:46.212 --> 15:50.081
You got me this job.
I should be grateful.

15:50.083 --> 15:52.617
I am, but just, you know, I get
a little finicky about my stuff.

15:52.619 --> 15:55.186
That's all.

15:55.188 --> 15:57.655
- It's all good.

15:57.657 --> 15:59.390
Are we all good?

15:59.392 --> 16:02.593
- We good.

16:02.595 --> 16:04.362
- What's that cooler?

16:04.364 --> 16:06.698
- Nothing.
It's mine.

[electronic ding]

16:13.440 --> 16:16.174
What happened
to my <i>tavis smileys?</i>

16:16.176 --> 16:18.276
- Oh, crap.
Were those yours?

16:18.278 --> 16:19.711
- I never want to see you
working

16:19.713 --> 16:21.546
In the upstairs office again!

16:21.548 --> 16:23.514
Do you hear me?

16:23.516 --> 16:26.684
- But my only crime was loving
the local sports teams

16:26.686 --> 16:28.353
And trying to be
one of the guys.

16:28.355 --> 16:29.520
- Silence.

16:29.522 --> 16:31.222
You'll now be working
in the warehouse

16:31.224 --> 16:33.558
With the untouchables.

16:33.560 --> 16:36.327
Now go make your hands
rough with work.

16:36.329 --> 16:39.130
- Okay, boss.

16:39.132 --> 16:40.498
Pam, you know
this is ridiculous, right?

16:40.500 --> 16:42.667
Like, you're smarter than him.
- Shh, shh, shh.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.402
- This is never gonna work.
- Shh, shh.

16:44.404 --> 16:45.570
Remember your lines.

16:45.572 --> 16:47.638
- What lines?
- Go move some paper.

16:49.608 --> 16:50.575
- Hey, you know that guy frank

16:50.577 --> 16:52.010
Who works
in the warehouse?

16:52.012 --> 16:53.011
- He's not my hire,
but I know who he is.

16:53.013 --> 16:54.045
- Okay, what is he like?

16:54.047 --> 16:56.314
Does he have, like,
a favorite pair of boots

16:56.316 --> 16:57.648
Or a lunchbox?

16:57.650 --> 16:59.083
- What, is he retiring?

16:59.085 --> 17:00.118
You getting him a gift
or something?

17:00.120 --> 17:01.419
- Yeah, something like that.

17:01.421 --> 17:02.687
- I know he loves
his pickup truck.

17:02.689 --> 17:03.688
- Oh, great, his truck.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.123
- Great. Get the plate number.

17:05.125 --> 17:06.657
- Okay, do you know the plate--
never mind.

17:06.659 --> 17:08.092
Why would you know that,

17:08.094 --> 17:10.695
- So we know
which truck to fill.

17:10.697 --> 17:12.130
- While I got you
on the phone,

17:12.132 --> 17:14.499
Your husband's like a sloppy,
homeless hobo.

17:14.501 --> 17:16.200
Can you fix that?
- Yeah.

17:16.202 --> 17:17.201
I was kind of hoping you could.

17:17.203 --> 17:18.703
I gotta go.
Bye.

17:18.705 --> 17:20.772
Come on.

17:24.143 --> 17:25.176
- Hold on a second.

17:25.178 --> 17:27.578
Sundeep, let's get you closer

17:27.580 --> 17:29.180
To the senator.

17:29.182 --> 17:30.648
Just about there.
Great.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.550
And, oscar, I'm gonna need you

17:32.552 --> 17:34.185
To step a little closer
to the senator as well.

17:34.187 --> 17:36.721
Somewhere there.
- He's blocking me.

17:36.723 --> 17:38.089
- It's only a photo, honey.

17:38.091 --> 17:39.157
- Excuse me.
What's your name?

17:39.159 --> 17:40.825
- Shawn.
- Lashawn, great.

17:40.827 --> 17:42.560
You want to be in a photo?
Right this way.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.662
Not you. No.
- He put me here.

17:44.664 --> 17:46.164
- He put you
right in front of me?

17:46.166 --> 17:47.398
- He placed me there. He did.
He placed me here.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.834
- Let's just wheel margaret

17:49.836 --> 17:52.737
Right in front--
- ow!

17:52.739 --> 17:55.239
- Here.
- Robert.

17:55.241 --> 17:56.641
- Smile.

17:59.178 --> 18:01.345
- I'm done.
What are you...

18:01.347 --> 18:03.214
Is that supposed
to be my mural?

18:03.216 --> 18:06.084
- Yeah, frank draws a butt
on your mural.

18:06.086 --> 18:09.087
I'm drawing your mural
on frank's truck's butt.

18:09.089 --> 18:10.421
Eye for an eye, <i>mamacita.</i>

18:10.423 --> 18:12.290
- Aw, dwight,
that's really sweet.

18:12.292 --> 18:14.158
- Let's see yours.
- Oh, no.

18:14.160 --> 18:15.526
I'm embarrassed.
It's stupid.

18:15.528 --> 18:17.829
- This is amazing!

18:17.831 --> 18:21.866
Frank, and he's leaving a trail
of poops?

18:21.868 --> 18:24.135
- Yeah.
- And he has saggy boobs.

18:24.137 --> 18:26.471
- I saw that.
It's great.

18:26.473 --> 18:28.239
- I feel better.

18:28.241 --> 18:29.240
- Good.

18:29.242 --> 18:30.308
I'm glad you feel better.

18:30.310 --> 18:31.542
This has been a wonderful day.

18:31.544 --> 18:33.211
I have to say,

18:33.213 --> 18:34.879
I like hanging out
with a vengeful bitch.

18:34.881 --> 18:36.514
- I know.

18:36.516 --> 18:37.715
You miss angela, don't you?

18:37.717 --> 18:39.250
- Ugh, don't sympathize.

18:39.252 --> 18:41.652
You're ruining the mood.
Back to work.

18:41.654 --> 18:45.490
Draw his penis.

18:45.492 --> 18:48.726
- I got back at frank in
the most fitting way possible.

18:48.728 --> 18:50.795
With my art.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.497
You know,
the paints are water-based.

18:52.499 --> 18:53.631
It's gonna come off
with a hose.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.566
But I think the lesson
will last--

18:55.568 --> 18:57.235
- Lady, my truck?

18:57.237 --> 18:58.603
You had no right.

18:58.605 --> 19:00.204
- No, you had no right!

19:00.206 --> 19:01.772
- It's a $40,000 truck.

19:01.774 --> 19:03.441
- So?
You started it.

19:03.443 --> 19:05.476
- So? So somebody needs
to shut you up.

19:05.478 --> 19:08.746
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Whoa.

19:08.748 --> 19:10.515
- Easy.
- Son of a bitch.

19:10.517 --> 19:13.151
- Guys?
- You're gonna hit a woman?

19:13.153 --> 19:16.154
[all grunting]

19:16.156 --> 19:17.221
- Thanks so much for coming.

19:17.223 --> 19:18.923
Thank you so much.

19:18.925 --> 19:20.491
Well...

19:20.493 --> 19:23.928
Have we all calmed down yet?

19:23.930 --> 19:26.164
- Yes.
Sorry about that.

19:26.166 --> 19:27.832
- It was all my fault.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.767
- Let's all try
to do better next time.

19:29.769 --> 19:31.302
Kevin, great to see you.

19:31.304 --> 19:32.436
- Thank you
for the food.

19:32.438 --> 19:35.406
And also you suck.

19:36.308 --> 19:37.475
- I beg your pardon.

19:37.477 --> 19:39.944
- You're, like,
a terrible person.

19:39.946 --> 19:42.914
These guys care about you,

19:42.916 --> 19:45.683
And you're just using them.

19:45.685 --> 19:49.954
Again, the food was very good.

19:57.296 --> 19:59.263
- Well, I'm gonna say something
to the producers.

19:59.265 --> 20:00.765
- No, no, it's--
- you shouldn't be fired.

20:00.767 --> 20:02.867
I mean,
you were just protecting me.

20:02.869 --> 20:05.336
- It's all good.
I knew what I was doing.

20:05.338 --> 20:08.606
I mean, because you put
so much into that.

20:08.608 --> 20:09.974
- Oh, no, forget about my mural.
It's stupid.

20:09.976 --> 20:11.309
- No, you worked hard on that.

20:11.311 --> 20:15.279
I'm glad they're firing him too.

20:15.281 --> 20:16.781
- It's crazy.

20:16.783 --> 20:18.716
Brian, I'm so sorry.

20:18.718 --> 20:24.589
- Look, I don't--I don't want to
put myself where I don't belong.

20:24.591 --> 20:26.857
If you ever need me,
you just call me,

20:26.859 --> 20:29.961
And I'll be there for you.

20:29.963 --> 20:32.296
- Thanks, brian.

20:32.298 --> 20:36.267
- See ya.

20:50.515 --> 20:53.517
- Wow, this whole philly thing
has been so much fun

20:53.519 --> 20:56.988
That I may have lost sight
of what really matters.

20:56.990 --> 20:59.290
I mean, having fun
is not nearly as important

20:59.292 --> 21:01.492
As being good to the people
you really care about.

21:01.494 --> 21:04.495
I mean,
that's just roommates 101.

21:04.497 --> 21:06.297
- Oh, come on.
- Oh.

21:06.299 --> 21:07.565
- Uh.
- Oh!

21:07.567 --> 21:09.033
- Damn.

21:09.035 --> 21:11.035
- You wins.

21:11.037 --> 21:14.305
[gunfire and explosions
in video game]

21:17.009 --> 21:18.042
How good did that feel?

21:18.044 --> 21:20.911
- That felt really good
actually.
