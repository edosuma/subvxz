WEBVTT

00:01.992 --> 00:03.627
Hey, Charles, want to grab
a beer before you go home?

00:03.660 --> 00:05.230
- Ooh, a yeast feast.
- Never mind.

00:05.262 --> 00:06.230
No, no, no, I want to go, it's just,

00:06.264 --> 00:08.432
there's a huge emergency
I have to deal with first.

00:08.465 --> 00:09.766
Oh, no. Is everything okay?

00:09.800 --> 00:10.835
It's about my food truck.

00:10.868 --> 00:12.236
I have to get a parking spot.

00:12.269 --> 00:13.503
Oh. That doesn't sound as intense

00:13.537 --> 00:14.839
as you were making it out to be.

00:14.871 --> 00:17.242
- Move your ass, you old bitch!
- What is happening?

00:17.274 --> 00:18.575
We have to get there by 7:00

00:18.609 --> 00:20.445
when they lift the parking restrictions.

00:20.478 --> 00:23.224
It's the best spot in Brooklyn,
and everyone wants it.

00:23.249 --> 00:24.584
Get the hell out of the way!

00:27.153 --> 00:30.590
Charles, I highly doubt
the entire food truck industry

00:30.622 --> 00:32.057
is racing to get into this one spot.

00:32.090 --> 00:33.592
It's not "Mad Max."

00:33.625 --> 00:34.860
We're neck and neck with rice pudding.

00:34.893 --> 00:36.629
You got Korean tacos on your six.

00:36.662 --> 00:38.864
Oh, my God, it's real.
We're on the Fury Road.

00:39.765 --> 00:41.167
Witness me, blood bag!

00:41.199 --> 00:42.535
Hold on tight!

01:14.285 --> 01:16.643
That was the most stressful
thing I've ever gone through,

01:16.668 --> 01:18.137
and I was wrongfully imprisoned
last year.

01:18.170 --> 01:19.572
That was fun.

01:19.605 --> 01:22.007
Every aspect of owning
a food truck is fun.

01:22.040 --> 01:23.676
It is fun, fun, fun.

01:23.717 --> 01:25.623
What the hell do you want, Troy?

01:25.648 --> 01:26.857
You stole my spot, you son of a bitch!

01:26.891 --> 01:28.160
Oh, go on, get out of here.

01:28.192 --> 01:29.995
- You're just jealous.
- I'm not going anywhere! I made a signal,

01:30.028 --> 01:31.329
- and you made an illegal U-turn!
- Give me a break.

01:31.361 --> 01:33.030
- I should call the cops!
- Oh, are you gonna

01:33.064 --> 01:34.299
- call the cops?
- Yeah, I'm gonna call the cops!

01:34.332 --> 01:35.967
- I am the cops!
- Oh, you're a cop now?

01:35.999 --> 01:36.968
Why don't you go back
to your garbage truck

01:37.001 --> 01:38.303
and cook some pudding?

01:38.335 --> 01:39.304
You're gonna regret this.

01:39.337 --> 01:41.505
Kill yourself, Troy!

01:41.538 --> 01:43.308
Jake, I have a confession to make.

01:43.341 --> 01:45.323
The food truck is kind of
stressing me out.

01:47.412 --> 01:49.955
Bad news, Captain.
A water main burst downtown.

01:50.034 --> 01:51.970
- There's been several injuries.
- Oh, that's unfortunate.

01:52.004 --> 01:53.873
And the victims are
in our blah-blah-blah,

01:53.906 --> 01:55.240
but tell him the real tragedy, Terry.

01:55.273 --> 01:56.374
Olivia Crawford...

01:56.408 --> 01:58.210
AKA your main commish competish.

01:58.242 --> 02:00.745
Tweeted a statement addressing
the water main break,

02:00.778 --> 02:03.114
and she's been retweeted by the mayor.

02:03.147 --> 02:05.116
"Kudos to our brave officers"...

02:05.150 --> 02:07.085
- Hey, now.
- Whoa! What is going on?

02:07.118 --> 02:08.753
It's in all caps.

02:08.786 --> 02:10.388
Anyway, I don't see
how this is bad news.

02:10.422 --> 02:12.124
Because the commissioner race,

02:12.156 --> 02:13.291
like all of life,

02:13.325 --> 02:14.760
is a popularity contest,

02:14.792 --> 02:17.296
and Olivia is sitting
at the hot senior table

02:17.328 --> 02:20.099
whilst you are eating lunch alone.

02:20.131 --> 02:23.201
If the mayor wants to make me
the next NYPD commissioner,

02:23.234 --> 02:25.438
it'll be because of my record
and my qualifications,

02:25.470 --> 02:27.439
not my social media presence.

02:27.472 --> 02:29.208
- This is a serious job.
<i>- I know.</i>

02:29.240 --> 02:32.043
But like it or not,
the decision is political,

02:32.077 --> 02:34.914
and social media
is a part of politics now.

02:34.946 --> 02:36.915
- You need a Twitter account.
- Not gonna happen.

02:36.948 --> 02:38.784
The whole thing is inane.

02:38.816 --> 02:41.320
Besides, 140 characters is far more

02:41.352 --> 02:42.821
than anyone needs to make a point.

02:42.855 --> 02:45.323
They actually upped it to 280.

02:45.357 --> 02:46.826
Oh, good God.

02:46.858 --> 02:48.194
<i>I'm so miserable, Jake.</i>

02:48.226 --> 02:50.195
The truck is hemorrhaging money.
I'm going bankrupt.

02:50.228 --> 02:51.996
- I never see my family.
- All right, look.

02:52.029 --> 02:54.399
You just have to find a way
to reduce expenses.

02:54.433 --> 02:56.268
I've started saving $200 a month

02:56.301 --> 02:57.803
just by buying "John Wick"

02:57.835 --> 02:59.137
instead of renting it every two nights.

02:59.171 --> 03:00.106
I have cut costs.

03:00.138 --> 03:02.507
I fired my only employee, Ted,
which was awful.

03:02.541 --> 03:04.076
Okay, look, I hate to ask this,

03:04.108 --> 03:05.945
but have you considered
shutting the truck down?

03:05.977 --> 03:07.846
You're always bragging about
how much Boyles love to give up.

03:07.880 --> 03:09.482
I can't. I'm in so much debt.

03:09.514 --> 03:11.149
I took out a loan for the truck.

03:11.183 --> 03:12.852
I got Amy to invest.

03:12.885 --> 03:15.087
No, the only way out
of this hole is to keep digging.

03:15.119 --> 03:17.088
That's not how holes work...
title of your sex tape...

03:17.121 --> 03:18.423
Charles, look, you're gonna

03:18.457 --> 03:20.126
find your way out of this, I swear.

03:20.159 --> 03:21.861
- It's all gonna work out.
- You're right.

03:21.893 --> 03:24.063
You know, if I just work hard
and stay positive,

03:24.095 --> 03:25.463
I'm sure it'll be a huge success

03:25.496 --> 03:26.766
and everything will be okay.

03:26.798 --> 03:27.932
There you go.

03:29.802 --> 03:31.470
Hello? Oh.

03:31.502 --> 03:33.905
Okay. No, thank you.

03:33.939 --> 03:36.007
So my truck burned down.

03:36.041 --> 03:37.109
Hey.

03:37.142 --> 03:38.944
Someone robbed a bodega on 4th Street.

03:38.976 --> 03:40.278
It's the fifth one this week.

03:40.311 --> 03:42.248
It's so sad that
someone's targeting bodegas.

03:42.280 --> 03:44.016
They're part of the fabric of New York.

03:44.048 --> 03:45.817
- You shop at them a lot?
- No. They overcharge

03:45.851 --> 03:46.952
for everything, and they sell rat poison

03:46.984 --> 03:48.254
right next to the bananas.

03:48.286 --> 03:50.022
Yeah, they're gross.
I hope they never change.

03:50.054 --> 03:51.256
Anyway, Holt wants us to interview

03:51.290 --> 03:52.924
some of the bodega owners and figure out

03:52.958 --> 03:54.493
where to assign
additional uniformed officers.

03:54.525 --> 03:56.028
I put a map up on the server...

03:56.060 --> 03:57.962
No! Just email it to me.

03:57.995 --> 03:59.798
I hate servers. Bye!

03:59.832 --> 04:01.132
Wait. Why'd you close
your laptop so fast?

04:01.166 --> 04:02.935
- What are you hiding?
- Nurthing.

04:02.968 --> 04:04.203
- You're hiding something.
- What?

04:04.236 --> 04:06.471
- Just 'cause I said "nurthing"?
- Yes.

04:06.505 --> 04:08.808
No!

04:08.840 --> 04:10.909
Aww, you're looking at wedding dresses?

04:10.942 --> 04:12.877
- That one's dope.
- That's not what I was doing.

04:12.910 --> 04:14.412
My computer must've gone
to this site on its own.

04:14.446 --> 04:16.482
- How is that possible?
- It's broken, Y2K.

04:16.514 --> 04:17.817
I'll fix it.

04:18.983 --> 04:20.351
There, it's fixed.

04:20.385 --> 04:22.021
- You're weird.
- I know.

04:22.053 --> 04:23.522
Oh, God. My truck.

04:23.555 --> 04:25.090
This truck was my baby!

04:25.123 --> 04:26.591
All right, look, Charles,
I know you're upset,

04:26.625 --> 04:28.027
but maybe there's a silver lining here.

04:28.060 --> 04:30.328
- I mean, you had insurance, right?
- Yeah. I already called them.

04:30.361 --> 04:31.815
So maybe you'll get some money for this,

04:31.846 --> 04:33.899
and you can pay off your debts,
starting with Amy.

04:33.931 --> 04:35.500
I'm sorry, that was selfish.
Forget I said it.

04:35.534 --> 04:37.336
You can pay off your debts,
starting with Amy.

04:37.368 --> 04:38.503
Whoops, I did it again.

04:38.536 --> 04:40.171
You're right. This is my way out.

04:40.204 --> 04:41.173
It's a miracle.

04:41.205 --> 04:42.307
Oh, my God!

04:42.341 --> 04:43.976
Jake? Boyle?

04:44.009 --> 04:45.511
Adrian. What are you doing here?

04:45.543 --> 04:46.611
I'm an insurance investigator now.

04:46.644 --> 04:48.079
I thought you were in Alaska.

04:48.113 --> 04:50.115
Oh, yeah, I was,
after Rosa and I broke up,

04:50.147 --> 04:51.316
but then I accidentally killed

04:51.349 --> 04:53.885
a "protected buffalo"... self-defense.

04:53.918 --> 04:56.555
Next thing I know, Fish and Game
are all over my ass.

04:56.587 --> 04:58.189
I ended up in a fight with a bear,

04:58.223 --> 05:00.292
and I had to think to myself,
why am I even here?

05:00.325 --> 05:02.127
Wait a minute. You fought a bear?

05:02.159 --> 05:03.462
Big time. The trick on that:

05:03.495 --> 05:05.331
head-butt him in the penis,
push him over a cliff.

05:05.363 --> 05:06.931
Ah, I bet that works
with a lot of animals.

05:06.964 --> 05:08.166
Only the male ones.

05:08.200 --> 05:09.534
- Learned that the hard way.
- Hmm.

05:09.567 --> 05:11.002
Anyway, you know that if you guys want

05:11.036 --> 05:12.637
to get in touch with me,
there's easier ways

05:12.671 --> 05:14.305
than burning down your truck, right?

05:14.339 --> 05:16.208
What? Burning down my truck?

05:16.240 --> 05:18.510
Yeah, it's obviously arson, you did it,

05:18.543 --> 05:19.644
you're not gonna get a dime

05:19.678 --> 05:21.213
and are probably gonna go to jail.

05:21.245 --> 05:23.790
So... what's going on with you guys?

05:23.815 --> 05:26.165
Give me that juicy
Nine-Nine goss, am I right?

05:31.416 --> 05:32.741
This is insane.

05:32.766 --> 05:34.984
I mean, Charles loved this truck.
It's his baby.

05:35.009 --> 05:36.208
There's no way he'd burn it down.

05:36.262 --> 05:37.682
The world is a messed up place, Jake.

05:37.714 --> 05:38.715
People kill their babies.

05:38.748 --> 05:39.950
Babies kill their parents.

05:39.983 --> 05:41.652
It's the circle of life.

05:41.685 --> 05:44.055
- That was clearly a triangle.
- Okay, fine, busted.

05:44.087 --> 05:45.822
I just had the stove's gas line cleaned.

05:45.856 --> 05:47.524
Maybe it was put back in wrong
or something.

05:47.558 --> 05:49.726
Look, I've caught
enough arsonists in my day

05:49.760 --> 05:51.027
to know that the owner always does it.

05:51.060 --> 05:52.674
Chuck, how's the truck been doing?

05:52.699 --> 05:53.890
- Pretty terrible.
- Hmm?

05:53.930 --> 05:55.599
I was just saying,
it's a miracle it burned down.

05:55.632 --> 05:57.253
Okay, I know Charles
sounds hella guilty right now,

05:57.278 --> 05:58.435
but you know he didn't do it.

05:58.469 --> 05:59.496
Charles, this isn't
looking good for you.

05:59.521 --> 06:01.215
Anybody else that might have
done this? Any enemies?

06:01.251 --> 06:02.453
Well, my dad's best friend and I

06:02.485 --> 06:03.924
have a pretty intense rivalry,

06:03.949 --> 06:05.523
but I don't think my aunt
would do anything illegal.

06:05.556 --> 06:06.758
Oh, my God.

06:06.790 --> 06:08.692
Wait. The rice pudding truck guy!

06:08.725 --> 06:10.727
Oh, my God. That bastard Troy.

06:10.761 --> 06:13.206
We just got into a fight
about this very parking spot.

06:13.231 --> 06:15.198
- He said I'd regret it.
- Yeah, and that's what happened.

06:15.223 --> 06:16.234
You're regretting it!

06:16.266 --> 06:17.839
Come on, you know
we didn't commit arson.

06:17.864 --> 06:19.636
- Adrian, this is us.
- Not the TV show.

06:19.661 --> 06:20.907
- We are your friends.
- Not the movie.

06:20.940 --> 06:22.008
- You got to have faith.
- Not the song.

06:22.041 --> 06:23.176
Are you doing this on purpose?

06:23.208 --> 06:24.198
- The third one, yes.
- Okay.

06:24.223 --> 06:26.346
I'll admit, arson does seem
out of character for you.

06:26.371 --> 06:27.869
Okay, look me in the eyes.

06:27.964 --> 06:31.368
Look me in the eyes like the bear did.

06:38.576 --> 06:39.911
Okay.

06:39.944 --> 06:41.879
I believe you, and together,

06:41.911 --> 06:43.885
we're gonna catch the SOB that did this.

06:45.850 --> 06:47.652
I'm so glad he didn't
head-butt me in the penis.

06:47.685 --> 06:49.299
That's all I was thinking about.

06:49.586 --> 06:50.822
<i>Cheddar!</i>

06:50.855 --> 06:52.423
- That's a really good job.
- Stay, stay.

06:52.456 --> 06:54.626
What's going on here?
Why is Cheddar here?

06:54.658 --> 06:55.759
And why is he in swim trunks?

06:55.793 --> 06:57.295
Because the little sailor outfit

06:57.327 --> 06:58.829
- wouldn't fit his tush.
- Excuse me?

06:58.863 --> 07:00.497
We're setting you up a Twitter account,

07:00.531 --> 07:01.699
and the fastest way to get followers

07:01.731 --> 07:02.933
is cute animal pics.

07:02.966 --> 07:04.534
I follow an account that's just

07:04.567 --> 07:07.014
this one real grouchy chinchilla.

07:07.039 --> 07:08.575
He hates waking up so much!

07:08.607 --> 07:10.710
He really does. He's like "Ooh!"

07:10.744 --> 07:12.011
This is ridiculous.

07:12.044 --> 07:13.713
This has nothing to do with police work.

07:13.746 --> 07:15.081
Exactly. It's about being noticed,

07:15.114 --> 07:16.984
and right now, no one is noticing you.

07:17.016 --> 07:18.684
I didn't even realize we were talking

07:18.717 --> 07:20.052
to a third party, presently.

07:20.085 --> 07:22.054
Fine. If you really
think it's necessary,

07:22.088 --> 07:24.491
I will establish
a social media presence.

07:24.523 --> 07:25.858
But I'll be setting up my own accounts,

07:25.891 --> 07:27.126
and I assure you,

07:27.160 --> 07:29.996
I won't be resorting to foolish gimmicks
involving my dog.

07:30.030 --> 07:31.864
Uh, you might want
to rethink that stance,

07:31.898 --> 07:34.133
because how cute would Cheddar
look in this hat?

07:34.167 --> 07:36.102
Please. When it comes to clothes,

07:36.136 --> 07:38.638
Cheddar wears little booties
in the snow,

07:38.672 --> 07:41.142
or Cheddar wears nothing.

07:41.874 --> 07:44.110
Troy's not home, but I say we wait.

07:44.143 --> 07:46.946
I have some hard questions
for that rice pudding bastard.

07:46.979 --> 07:49.482
So, Adrian, how's life
as an insurance investigator?

07:49.515 --> 07:50.917
It's amazing. At Gray Star Mutual,

07:50.951 --> 07:52.986
they let me do whatever I want,

07:53.018 --> 07:55.155
as long as I'm getting that job
done, and you know I am.

07:55.188 --> 07:57.124
Last week, I waterboarded a dude.

07:57.157 --> 07:58.892
- Oh, that's not legal.
- Doesn't matter.

07:58.924 --> 08:00.994
I'm not a cop.
Anyway, what's up with you guys?

08:01.027 --> 08:02.463
Hey, Jake, who you porking?

08:02.496 --> 08:06.032
Uh, I guess Amy and I are still...

08:06.066 --> 08:08.035
- I don't want to say it.
- Yep.

08:08.068 --> 08:10.037
- Porking.
- Yeah, you are. Nice.

08:10.070 --> 08:11.505
Actually, we got engaged.

08:11.537 --> 08:13.006
What the hell? How come I didn't know?

08:13.039 --> 08:14.608
I thought we were supposed
to be friends.

08:14.640 --> 08:16.910
Oh, wait a minute.
Did this, like, just happen?

08:16.943 --> 08:18.912
Well, it was at Halloween.

08:18.945 --> 08:20.547
Wha... no, that's so long ago!

08:20.580 --> 08:22.649
Charles, are you just
finding out about this too?

08:22.681 --> 08:23.917
No, I was there.

08:23.950 --> 08:25.551
You were there? Who else?

08:25.585 --> 08:26.787
Who else got to be a part of this?

08:26.820 --> 08:29.156
Nobody, you know, just...

08:29.188 --> 08:30.657
Holt and...

08:30.689 --> 08:32.058
- Terry and Rosa.
- Okay.

08:32.092 --> 08:33.894
- And Hitchcock and Scully.
- Seriously?

08:33.926 --> 08:35.095
And this creepy guy named Bill.

08:35.128 --> 08:36.996
Oh, come on! I'm the creepy guy

08:37.029 --> 08:38.931
that's supposed to be at stuff
that you have happen.

08:38.965 --> 08:40.566
Look, you just left town,

08:40.600 --> 08:42.503
and we don't exactly have
a text relationship...

08:42.535 --> 08:43.604
How dare you?

08:43.636 --> 08:45.705
May 10th, I texted you,

08:45.739 --> 08:47.273
I'm at the Gaga concert, you here,

08:47.306 --> 08:49.142
question mark, question mark,
question mark.

08:49.175 --> 08:52.079
You texted back, No. Frowny face.

08:52.111 --> 08:53.980
Look, I've been really busy.
I'm sorry, okay?

08:54.013 --> 08:55.782
I understand.

08:55.815 --> 08:58.085
You know, I just didn't hear
about this one thing.

08:58.118 --> 08:59.953
I mean, I can't imagine
there are any other

08:59.985 --> 09:02.855
major milestones that I've missed.

09:02.888 --> 09:04.157
- Are there?
- I mean, Amy's a sergeant.

09:04.190 --> 09:05.225
- No.
- And Holt's up

09:05.258 --> 09:06.926
- for commissioner.
- Seriously?

09:06.960 --> 09:08.829
And Dr. Ronald Yee came to the precinct

09:08.861 --> 09:10.062
and taught a course on forensics.

09:10.095 --> 09:11.831
The Dr. Ronald Yee?

09:11.864 --> 09:13.066
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, my God!

09:13.099 --> 09:15.243
- Yee was in the building?
- Yeah.

09:15.268 --> 09:16.728
Wow, didn't realize
the Yee news was up there

09:16.753 --> 09:18.104
- with the other stuff.
- Oh, come on, Jake.

09:18.138 --> 09:20.773
Yee only wrote the book on
forensic facial reconstruction.

09:20.806 --> 09:22.075
He's a rock star!

09:22.108 --> 09:23.744
You guys could have texted me, but no,

09:23.777 --> 09:26.979
because I bet you haven't
thought about me once

09:27.013 --> 09:28.581
since I dumped Rosa.

09:28.614 --> 09:30.082
- Did you dump her?
- You know what?

09:30.115 --> 09:32.619
I need some air. I'm storming out.

09:32.652 --> 09:35.022
I'm storming out!

09:35.055 --> 09:36.924
So I can spare four uniformed officers

09:36.956 --> 09:39.258
to do hourly pass-bys
of the bodegas south of 4th,

09:39.292 --> 09:41.994
and I'll coordinate with the, um...

09:42.027 --> 09:43.162
hourly pass-bys of the...

09:43.196 --> 09:44.630
Wait. What was that?

09:44.663 --> 09:46.198
That was me talking about
hourly pass-bys.

09:46.231 --> 09:48.100
Oh, yeah, I heard about
the hourly pass-bys.

09:48.133 --> 09:50.137
Twice. I meant...

09:50.170 --> 09:52.606
That subtle side look.

09:52.638 --> 09:54.007
There was no subtle side look.

09:54.040 --> 09:55.242
You're right, 'cause it wasn't subtle.

09:55.274 --> 09:58.077
It was an unsubtle side look at...

09:58.110 --> 09:59.245
that dress in the shop.

09:59.278 --> 10:00.780
Why are you being such a nutjob

10:00.814 --> 10:02.115
about looking for a wedding dress?

10:02.148 --> 10:04.884
Because being
a female sergeant is difficult.

10:04.917 --> 10:06.085
I have to work twice as hard

10:06.119 --> 10:07.620
to gain my officers' respect,

10:07.653 --> 10:10.023
and looking at girly dresses
isn't going to help.

10:10.056 --> 10:12.893
Plus, it's a new job, and I need
to make it a priority.

10:12.926 --> 10:14.294
Dude, I get that, but if you want

10:14.326 --> 10:16.830
a beautiful wedding dress,
you deserve to find one.

10:16.863 --> 10:17.898
Look, there are no cops around.

10:17.931 --> 10:19.199
Nobody's gonna see you.

10:19.231 --> 10:20.799
Why don't we just take our break now,

10:20.824 --> 10:21.825
try one on?

10:21.850 --> 10:23.385
- Okay?
- Okay.

10:23.410 --> 10:24.814
- Okay?
- Okay.

10:24.839 --> 10:25.905
- Okay?
- Okay.

10:25.939 --> 10:28.342
Hell yeah!

10:28.374 --> 10:29.342
They are closed.

10:29.375 --> 10:31.043
- We will come back later.
- Yeah.

10:31.076 --> 10:33.179
<i>Where did Adrian go? He seemed upset.</i>

10:33.212 --> 10:34.647
- Should we be worried?
- Always.

10:34.681 --> 10:36.917
We should always be worried about him.

10:36.950 --> 10:38.652
Jake. Look, look.

10:38.693 --> 10:41.135
Excuse me, Troy Lunniker, we are...

10:41.190 --> 10:42.846
I know exactly who you are,
you spot-stealing

10:42.893 --> 10:44.265
- son of a bitch!
- I didn't steal your spot!

10:44.290 --> 10:45.325
- You were too slow, you idiot!
- You did steal my spot, man.

10:45.358 --> 10:46.557
You with the horrible meatballs.

10:46.589 --> 10:47.927
You should call them crap balls, man!

10:47.960 --> 10:49.095
Oh, my food tastes like crap?

10:49.128 --> 10:50.797
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Stop.

10:50.830 --> 10:52.132
- Crap balls.
- Hey!

10:52.165 --> 10:53.767
Look, Detective Boyle's truck
burned down.

10:53.800 --> 10:55.135
Yeah, and you did it.

10:55.167 --> 10:56.637
You torched my truck,
and you're going to jail.

10:56.670 --> 10:58.805
Whoa. Someone burned down your truck?

10:58.837 --> 11:00.740
I'm sorry, man, but I would
never do anything like that.

11:00.773 --> 11:01.975
I swear it wasn't me.

11:02.008 --> 11:03.643
Well, I'd love to believe you, Troy,

11:03.676 --> 11:06.212
but I'm afraid we're gonna need
to see some proof.

11:06.245 --> 11:07.947
Oh, my God, he had so much proof.

11:07.980 --> 11:09.415
I can't believe he was on "Cash Cab"

11:09.449 --> 11:10.951
at the exact moment
my truck burned down.

11:10.984 --> 11:12.219
And he did so well.

11:12.252 --> 11:14.186
He named every member of The Monkees.

11:14.220 --> 11:16.056
- He even got Tork.
- No one gets Tork.

11:16.089 --> 11:17.257
I know. All right, so if it wasn't Troy,

11:17.290 --> 11:19.126
the question is, who could it have been?

11:19.959 --> 11:20.926
What's up, jerks?

11:22.162 --> 11:23.729
Pimento, you broke into my house?

11:23.763 --> 11:25.331
Yeah. I'm an insurance investigator.

11:25.364 --> 11:27.667
- I can do whatever I want.
- What are you doing here?

11:27.701 --> 11:29.702
I'm working the case.
I'm looking for clues.

11:29.735 --> 11:31.804
Come on, you already said
Charles couldn't do this.

11:31.837 --> 11:32.972
- I couldn't do it.
- That's what I thought.

11:33.005 --> 11:34.240
But then I realized,

11:34.273 --> 11:36.275
if you can hide your engagement from me,

11:36.308 --> 11:38.944
what else are you capable of hiding?

11:38.978 --> 11:40.414
Oh, right. Arson!

11:40.446 --> 11:42.249
Come on, don't you think
that's a bit of a stretch?

11:42.282 --> 11:43.917
Is it? Lab tests came back

11:43.950 --> 11:46.753
and said the accelerant used
in the fire was turpentine.

11:46.786 --> 11:50.757
And look what I found
in Boyle's wife's closet.

11:50.790 --> 11:52.392
Looks to me a lot like turpentine.

11:52.425 --> 11:55.762
Oh, I wouldn't do that.

11:55.795 --> 11:57.264
Turpentine, just like I thought.

11:57.297 --> 11:59.432
That's Genevieve's.
She uses it for her paintings.

11:59.465 --> 12:03.269
Oh, likely story.

12:03.302 --> 12:05.905
If that's the case,
then how do you explain this

12:05.939 --> 12:06.907
that I found on your fridge?

12:06.940 --> 12:07.907
My wedding invitation?

12:07.941 --> 12:09.276
Aha, so you admit it.

12:09.308 --> 12:11.177
Invites have gone out,
and I didn't get one!

12:11.210 --> 12:13.279
Oh, well, well, well.

12:13.312 --> 12:15.282
Now you both are gonna pay.

12:15.315 --> 12:16.717
- Adrian.
- Hey, come on.

12:16.749 --> 12:18.051
Oh, I thought you were
reaching for a gun.

12:18.084 --> 12:19.152
Oh, no, my friend.

12:19.185 --> 12:20.821
This is much worse than a gun.

12:20.854 --> 12:21.988
This is a stamp,

12:22.021 --> 12:23.323
a stamp that says...

12:24.923 --> 12:26.025
Denied.

12:26.058 --> 12:28.461
Your claim is denied.

12:37.348 --> 12:38.983
Do you really think
the insurance company

12:39.008 --> 12:41.413
will replace Adrian
as the investigator on my case?

12:41.438 --> 12:42.664
Yeah. It's Gray Star Mutual...

12:42.696 --> 12:44.130
"Where the feeling is mutual."

12:44.163 --> 12:47.467
And right now we're feeling
like we want a new investigator.

12:47.500 --> 12:48.534
Hi, I'm Travis.

12:48.567 --> 12:50.002
I've been reviewing your appeal.

12:50.036 --> 12:52.072
I understand you have a problem
with Mr. Pimento.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.539
Yes, we sort of have

12:53.572 --> 12:55.509
a complicated preexisting relationship,

12:55.542 --> 12:57.076
which I think is a conflict of interest.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.644
Okay, I'll be honest,

12:58.677 --> 13:01.081
we've had some problems
with Mr. Pimento before.

13:01.114 --> 13:03.249
I think he may have
broken into my apartment once.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.085
Oh, you'd know.
He leaves a lot of hair behind.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.552
- He's a shedder.
- Mm-hmm.

13:06.586 --> 13:08.087
Okay. I'll talk to my supervisor,

13:08.120 --> 13:09.121
see what can be done.

13:09.154 --> 13:10.756
Great. Thank you very much.

13:10.789 --> 13:13.493
See, Charles?
Things are starting to look up.

13:13.527 --> 13:14.628
Up your butt!

13:14.661 --> 13:16.497
Adrian! What a coincidence.

13:16.529 --> 13:18.511
We were just...
filing a complaint about you.

13:18.550 --> 13:19.490
You were obviously listening.

13:19.533 --> 13:20.500
I don't know why I'm trying to lie.

13:20.533 --> 13:21.768
Oh, we're locked in. Great.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.570
First you cut me out of your lives,

13:23.602 --> 13:25.638
then you try and get me fired?

13:25.672 --> 13:27.240
My therapist was right about you guys.

13:27.273 --> 13:29.809
- You're a couple of dinguses.
- You have a therapist?

13:29.842 --> 13:31.544
Yeah, he's helping me work on
my rotator cuff.

13:31.577 --> 13:32.745
Oh, I see, it's a physical therapist.

13:32.778 --> 13:34.914
Oh, he's very physical, Charles.

13:34.947 --> 13:36.283
Very physical.

13:39.586 --> 13:40.721
So what do you think?

13:40.754 --> 13:42.788
Mm, I don't love the sash.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.524
But it's fine. I'm just gonna get it.

13:44.557 --> 13:46.092
What? That's the first one you tried on.

13:46.125 --> 13:49.196
I once saw you look at 54
different accordion folders

13:49.229 --> 13:51.698
and not buy any of them
due to weak tabs.

13:51.730 --> 13:54.033
I file hard. I need strong tabs.

13:54.067 --> 13:56.537
I just don't want to take up
any more time.

13:56.570 --> 13:58.672
Your break's not even a quarter done.

13:58.705 --> 13:59.806
I'll stay another ten minutes.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.174
You'll stay until I dismiss you.

14:01.206 --> 14:03.445
Irene, music.

14:03.478 --> 14:04.853
Now spin.

14:04.878 --> 14:07.080
<i>All units, attempted 1030-Charlie.</i>

14:07.113 --> 14:09.716
<i>Bodega on Smith.
Perp is heading east on Baltic.</i>

14:09.749 --> 14:12.286
That's us! We're on Baltic.

14:12.318 --> 14:14.820
Oh, crap. That was him!

14:14.854 --> 14:15.822
<i>Hey!</i>

14:16.990 --> 14:18.558
NYPD, stop!

14:23.129 --> 14:24.831
Hey!

14:34.640 --> 14:36.576
- <i>Stay down!</i>
- Damn, sarge.

14:36.610 --> 14:38.579
Maybe I do like the sash.

14:38.611 --> 14:39.812
Sir, brace yourself.

14:39.846 --> 14:41.782
Olivia Crawford just tweeted a post

14:41.815 --> 14:43.216
of an officer carrying a woman

14:43.249 --> 14:44.784
through knee-deep flood waters.

14:44.817 --> 14:46.986
Spoiler alert:
they are of different races.

14:47.019 --> 14:48.288
Terry teared up.

14:48.321 --> 14:49.923
I love when calamity brings
people together.

14:49.956 --> 14:52.259
Sir, it got another retweet
from the mayor.

14:52.292 --> 14:53.894
It got a retweet from the governor.

14:53.927 --> 14:55.696
Well, I have already set up my accounts,

14:55.729 --> 14:58.131
and not to toot my own bugle,

14:58.163 --> 14:59.966
but I think I did an admirable job.

14:59.999 --> 15:02.201
Oh, okay, what's your handle?
I'll be your first follower.

15:02.235 --> 15:09.743
It's @5261796d6e6420486f6c74.

15:09.775 --> 15:12.111
It spells "Raymond Holt"
in hexadecimal code.

15:12.144 --> 15:13.947
- Clever, right?
- Captain, are you sure

15:13.980 --> 15:15.349
you wouldn't like some help with this?

15:15.381 --> 15:17.183
Oh, no need. Now, for my first tweet,

15:17.216 --> 15:19.251
I think I should give an update
on the water main break

15:19.284 --> 15:20.920
that's actually informative.

15:20.953 --> 15:26.892
"NYC H20-Main SITREP: at 2040 EDT

15:26.926 --> 15:33.133
current PSI 456 MAX CAP 204000 LPM."

15:33.166 --> 15:36.670
Suck on that tasty lemon drop,
Olivia Crawford.

15:36.702 --> 15:38.304
Oh, look at that. An alert.

15:38.337 --> 15:40.006
I'm probably trending already.

15:40.039 --> 15:41.841
What? My account has been deactivated?

15:41.874 --> 15:43.275
Twitter thinks you're a bot.

15:43.308 --> 15:45.379
Why? I am a human.

15:45.412 --> 15:46.722
I am a human male.

15:48.214 --> 15:49.316
<i>Adrian, open up.</i>

15:49.349 --> 15:50.651
Get out of here, Travis!

15:50.683 --> 15:51.751
Come on, Adrian, admit it.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.052
You have a conflict of interest.

15:53.086 --> 15:54.821
How could I have a conflict of interest?

15:54.854 --> 15:56.723
We barely have a relationship.

15:56.755 --> 15:58.190
We're not even friends anymore.

15:58.224 --> 16:00.427
- You saw to that, didn't you?
- That's crazy.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.129
We may have lost touch,
but we're still friends.

16:02.162 --> 16:05.065
Oh, is that right, Jake?
Are we still friends?

16:05.097 --> 16:07.333
If that's the case, then when
did I lose my virginity?

16:07.366 --> 16:08.701
Oh, man, you've told us

16:08.735 --> 16:10.336
so many intense graphic sex stories.

16:10.370 --> 16:12.806
I have! But a true friend

16:12.839 --> 16:15.042
always remembers a friend's first.

16:15.075 --> 16:17.343
Jake, we know this!
It's got to be one of the swamps.

16:17.376 --> 16:19.346
Uh, Florida swamp,
or Okefenokee Swamp, or...

16:19.379 --> 16:20.681
oh, was it a bayou?

16:20.714 --> 16:21.748
No, no, no! I've got it.

16:21.780 --> 16:22.948
Summer of '91, at a screening

16:22.981 --> 16:24.384
of "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves."

16:24.417 --> 16:27.254
Well done.
It was Bryan Adams' soundtrack

16:27.287 --> 16:29.956
and Kevin Costner's
flawless British accent

16:29.989 --> 16:32.893
that put us in the mood to get gross.

16:32.926 --> 16:34.828
Next question. Favorite shape?

16:34.860 --> 16:36.028
- Oval?
- Of course!

16:36.062 --> 16:37.964
- Favorite scent?
- Trick question.

16:37.996 --> 16:39.966
You lost your sense of smell in a...

16:39.999 --> 16:41.033
Shipwreck!

16:41.067 --> 16:43.169
Guys, we are friends!

16:43.202 --> 16:46.105
Aww, I love you guys.

16:47.506 --> 16:49.008
Are you still angry?

16:49.042 --> 16:50.711
No, that was a cathartic scream of love.

16:50.744 --> 16:51.711
- Understood.
- Good.

16:51.745 --> 16:52.745
Well, anyways, I'm sorry

16:52.778 --> 16:53.813
about how things went down, man.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.115
We should have stayed in touch.

16:55.148 --> 16:56.983
No, it's just as much my fault as yours.

16:57.015 --> 16:58.851
I could have kept in touch with you guys

16:58.884 --> 17:00.986
and probably should have
told you about my new family.

17:01.019 --> 17:02.088
Your new what now?

17:02.121 --> 17:04.123
Ah, Travis. Great, you're here.

17:04.156 --> 17:06.393
These gentlemen are innocent
and are free to go.

17:06.425 --> 17:08.194
- You're fired, Adrian.
- What?

17:08.227 --> 17:10.931
And as for you, my supervisor
and I reviewed your case.

17:10.963 --> 17:12.932
Turpentine is all the proof
we need to deny your claim.

17:12.964 --> 17:16.002
The feeling wasn't mutual.

17:19.319 --> 17:21.258
You're so lame, you know that, Travis?

17:21.305 --> 17:23.258
Wait a second.
Is this just because I did molly

17:23.328 --> 17:24.862
- with your daughter?
- You did?

17:24.938 --> 17:26.257
Don't think he knew about that.

17:26.281 --> 17:27.685
Just don't ever come back here again.

17:27.711 --> 17:29.102
If you do, I'll have you arrested.

17:29.135 --> 17:30.569
How dare you?

17:30.594 --> 17:31.971
I gave you the best two weeks
of my life!

17:32.005 --> 17:34.641
Oh, guys, I'm so screwed.
We got no leads.

17:34.673 --> 17:35.641
I'm not gonna get any of the money back.

17:35.675 --> 17:36.910
What do we do?

17:36.942 --> 17:39.145
We go directly
to Travis' house right now,

17:39.179 --> 17:40.546
pee on everything he owns,

17:40.580 --> 17:41.749
and then burn that place to the ground.

17:41.782 --> 17:42.916
- Adrian, that's it.
- It is?

17:42.948 --> 17:44.485
- Yes! I knew it!
- No, no, no.

17:44.517 --> 17:46.018
Not anything about anything you said.

17:46.052 --> 17:47.821
But, Charles, didn't you just
tell me you fired someone?

17:47.853 --> 17:49.722
Yeah, Ted. I took him out to dinner.

17:49.756 --> 17:50.990
He thought he was getting a promotion.

17:51.024 --> 17:52.244
It was a whole thing.

17:52.269 --> 17:53.727
He wept a lot. Not as much as me...

17:53.759 --> 17:55.440
Yeah, but the point is,
he was upset, right?

17:55.465 --> 17:57.205
And he knew where you liked
to park the truck.

17:57.230 --> 18:00.134
Uh-huh. And he never gave me
my key back.

18:00.167 --> 18:02.136
He said he lost it.
You really think it's him?

18:02.169 --> 18:03.441
I mean, it's just a hunch, but...

18:03.466 --> 18:04.871
We should go to his house
and burn it down.

18:04.904 --> 18:06.139
I was gonna say we could go investigate.

18:06.172 --> 18:07.407
Sure, sure, sure.

18:07.440 --> 18:08.608
And then burn it to the ground.

18:08.641 --> 18:10.177
No. No burning of anything!

18:10.209 --> 18:11.691
What? I already got the match lit.

18:11.745 --> 18:13.611
- How?
- Let's hurry up and get there.

18:14.113 --> 18:16.656
Captain, I'm trying
to get your account reinstated,

18:16.681 --> 18:17.785
but it could take a while.

18:17.817 --> 18:19.437
They say they have a lot of Nazi stuff

18:19.462 --> 18:20.453
on the front burner.

18:20.487 --> 18:21.462
And when you tweet again,

18:21.487 --> 18:23.657
you should probably stop
communicating in numbers, kay?

18:23.689 --> 18:25.625
There's a 0% chance of that.

18:25.659 --> 18:26.893
Besides, I won't be tweeting anymore.

18:26.927 --> 18:28.529
I just got off the phone with the head

18:28.562 --> 18:29.897
- of the selection committee.
- You did?

18:29.929 --> 18:31.899
Apparently, one of
the candidates for commissioner

18:31.931 --> 18:34.066
tweeted a picture
of the water main break

18:34.100 --> 18:35.836
and accidentally included a link

18:35.869 --> 18:37.538
to his favorite pornographic website...

18:37.571 --> 18:39.006
- Mm.
- Cosplay-butts-n-boobs.com.

18:39.038 --> 18:40.039
Amateur move.

18:40.073 --> 18:42.141
You should never copy-paste
if you're a perv.

18:42.175 --> 18:44.645
It's quite the scandal.
The candidate has dropped out.

18:44.678 --> 18:45.946
It's down to just three of us now.

18:45.978 --> 18:48.582
So I guess this proves
I was right all along.

18:48.614 --> 18:50.450
Social media... it's a fool's game,

18:50.484 --> 18:51.818
and only a fool would play.

18:51.866 --> 18:52.867
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

18:52.899 --> 18:55.771
And why is Cheddar wearing a beret?

18:57.371 --> 18:58.806
Uh...

18:58.839 --> 19:00.974
Kevin saw your photos and was amused,

19:01.008 --> 19:03.545
so we started an Instagram
account for Cheddar,

19:03.578 --> 19:06.047
who now has over 14,000 followers.

19:06.079 --> 19:07.349
Hoo-whee!

19:07.381 --> 19:08.949
It's an incredible feeling.

19:08.983 --> 19:10.551
<i>This is insulting.</i>

19:10.585 --> 19:12.053
First you fire me in front of my family.

19:12.086 --> 19:13.688
Ooh, Charles,
his family was at the dinner?

19:13.721 --> 19:14.756
It was not well-handled.

19:14.789 --> 19:15.790
Now you accuse me of arson.

19:15.822 --> 19:16.957
Just get out of my garage.

19:16.991 --> 19:18.393
<i>Hey, Ted?</i>

19:18.426 --> 19:19.961
How come you have all this turpentine?

19:19.993 --> 19:22.597
And this plastic bag filled with
matches and magnesium strips.

19:22.629 --> 19:23.964
I found it buried under the back porch,

19:23.997 --> 19:25.899
and I'm no expert, but it seems like

19:25.933 --> 19:28.936
that's the kind of stuff you'd
use to light a fire, right?

19:28.970 --> 19:31.039
Oh, there he goes.

19:33.474 --> 19:35.843
Say it with me, Jake.

19:35.877 --> 19:36.778
You've been...

19:36.810 --> 19:38.512
- Denied!
- Butt-slammed!

19:38.545 --> 19:40.814
- Wait, what?
- Denied, like the stamp?

19:40.848 --> 19:43.784
Oh, that is so much better.

19:43.818 --> 19:45.954
"Butt-slammed" is so stupid.

19:46.788 --> 19:48.656
Oh, is that the wedding dress

19:48.688 --> 19:50.992
from the Erica Somerfield
2018 fall collection?

19:51.024 --> 19:53.026
No way, the bodice is totally different.

19:53.060 --> 19:54.963
Why do you two know so much
about wedding dresses?

19:54.995 --> 19:56.663
They're the only thing
you can look at around here

19:56.696 --> 19:57.831
with safe search on!

19:57.865 --> 19:59.434
<i>All right, that's enough.</i>

19:59.466 --> 20:00.734
Can we all get back to police work

20:00.768 --> 20:02.737
and stop talking about wedding dresses?

20:02.770 --> 20:04.472
No. We're gonna talk about them,

20:04.504 --> 20:06.006
because while wearing a wedding dress,

20:06.040 --> 20:07.474
you leapt over a couch,

20:07.508 --> 20:09.077
sprinted down an alley,
and jumped off a car

20:09.109 --> 20:11.612
to subdue the crap out of a perp
like you were Wonder Woman.

20:11.646 --> 20:12.946
It was pretty cool, wasn't it?

20:12.980 --> 20:15.683
Amy, you are an amazing cop
and a great leader,

20:15.715 --> 20:17.685
and you have proven that
a billion times over.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.420
You can't let other people's
opinions get in the way

20:19.454 --> 20:21.156
of what you want, especially
because other people suck.

20:21.188 --> 20:22.756
Well, if I'm being honest,

20:22.790 --> 20:24.058
- I would like a prettier dress.
- There you go.

20:24.090 --> 20:25.659
And I would like it to have some lace.

20:25.693 --> 20:26.895
- Uh-huh.
- And a sweetheart neckline,

20:26.927 --> 20:28.629
- thank you very much.
- What else?

20:28.663 --> 20:30.432
And I want a mermaid cut
with tulip sleeves.

20:30.464 --> 20:31.765
Say it again. Say it loud.

20:31.799 --> 20:35.570
A mermaid cut
with tulip frickin' sleeves!

20:35.602 --> 20:37.504
Pimento's here! All right!

20:37.538 --> 20:38.772
Thanks so much for that text, man.

20:38.806 --> 20:40.074
- That meant a lot.
- The one that said,

20:40.107 --> 20:41.843
- "Want to grab a drink tonight?"
- Yeah.

20:41.876 --> 20:43.677
Hey, Boyle, did you get
that insurance payout?

20:43.711 --> 20:45.180
Yes, I am out
of the food truck business,

20:45.213 --> 20:47.303
and I no longer start
spontaneously weeping.

20:47.328 --> 20:49.851
- Nice.
- Listen, I'm sorry you got fired.

20:49.884 --> 20:51.752
Oh, don't worry about it.
I got myself fired, all right?

20:51.785 --> 20:54.154
Plus, doesn't matter.
I got a way better job now.

20:54.187 --> 20:56.925
I'm working at one of those
fancy hand lotion stores.

20:56.957 --> 20:58.792
Spoiler alert: I have a gun again,

20:58.826 --> 21:00.995
and I've gotten to use it three times.

21:01.028 --> 21:03.531
You would be surprised
how often teenage girls

21:03.563 --> 21:05.286
try and shoplift mango hand cream.

21:05.311 --> 21:07.535
- Huh.
- But it smells great!

21:07.568 --> 21:08.837
- I love it.
- I can get you some.

21:08.869 --> 21:10.671
Well, listen, man,
I've got something for you.

21:10.704 --> 21:11.806
Really? For me?

21:11.839 --> 21:12.840
It's an invitation to my wedding.

21:12.874 --> 21:15.176
Aw, Jake, I am so honored

21:15.208 --> 21:16.217
and would love to be...

21:16.242 --> 21:17.879
oh, nope, I can't make this.

21:17.912 --> 21:19.514
This is the same night as Lady Gaga.

21:19.547 --> 21:20.748
Oh, thank God. I didn't run it by Amy,

21:20.781 --> 21:22.250
so this worked out great for both of us!

21:22.282 --> 21:23.618
But honestly,

21:23.650 --> 21:24.785
nobody's gonna come to this,

21:24.819 --> 21:26.221
because everybody's gonna be at Gaga.

21:26.253 --> 21:27.789
