WEBVTT

00:11.382 --> 00:14.044
Dude! Shooting star!
Make a wish!

00:15.552 --> 00:18.646
That's not a shooting star.
It's just a firefly.

00:20.923 --> 00:22.515
What are you gonna
wish for, dude?

00:22.590 --> 00:23.649
Oh, you know...

00:23.724 --> 00:25.988
that something special
only two bros can share.

00:26.059 --> 00:27.994
I think I'm wishing
for the same thing!

00:28.061 --> 00:29.084
You mean the...

00:29.161 --> 00:31.687
Ancient psychic
tandem war elephant!

00:37.801 --> 00:40.668
Oh, man! I want to
ride it so bad!

00:40.736 --> 00:42.796
How do you even
control those things?

00:42.872 --> 00:44.897
You can't control it, dude.

00:44.973 --> 00:47.465
<i>You have to let it
give you control.</i>

00:47.542 --> 00:49.635
Oh, wow!

00:49.710 --> 00:52.577
Start wishing!

00:52.645 --> 00:53.645
What the?!

00:55.014 --> 00:58.347
<i>That's a distress flare from
my other hot dog knights!</i>

00:58.417 --> 01:01.443
<i>I sent them to rescue my
other other hot dog knights</i>

01:01.519 --> 01:03.714
who got trapped in a labyrinth!

01:03.787 --> 01:05.722
Their message says...

01:05.789 --> 01:07.381
"Baby...

01:07.456 --> 01:08.685
Us...

01:08.757 --> 01:10.623
Trouble...

01:10.693 --> 01:12.320
Time."

01:12.393 --> 01:14.793
They must be in great danger!

01:14.861 --> 01:17.956
Hot dog knights are slow.

01:22.234 --> 01:23.633
Don't worry, Princess.

01:23.702 --> 01:26.535
Jake and I are on it.

01:29.173 --> 01:31.437
Whoa. Fudge, man.

01:31.507 --> 01:32.998
This place is yoga balls huge!

01:34.142 --> 01:36.270
Yoga balls aren't that
really huge, dude.

01:36.345 --> 01:38.575
<i>Hey, man, I can't
analyze everything</i>

01:38.646 --> 01:40.114
that comes out of my mouth.

01:40.181 --> 01:43.617
Should we, like, try to cheat
and stretch over the walls?

01:43.683 --> 01:45.151
Naw, man. Look.

01:47.019 --> 01:48.419
Okay, well, then...

01:48.487 --> 01:50.478
I'll just hook my legs
around this stump

01:50.555 --> 01:52.166
and stretch us through
so we don't get lost.

01:52.190 --> 01:53.350
Like this. See?

01:53.423 --> 01:55.949
You're a cool guy, Jake.

01:56.026 --> 01:57.186
Thank you.

01:57.259 --> 01:58.090
Man!

01:58.160 --> 02:00.459
There's so many
passageways and stuff.

02:00.529 --> 02:05.522
It'll take us forever to find
those hot dog kni-i-i-i-ghts.

02:09.502 --> 02:11.198
Don't eat me, man!

02:11.270 --> 02:13.397
Naw, we're here
to save you, guy.

02:13.472 --> 02:16.600
Oh, thank the stars.
We were lost.

02:16.674 --> 02:18.939
How didn't you guys get lost?

02:19.010 --> 02:20.739
We're just gonna follow
Jake's body back.

02:20.810 --> 02:22.278
Ooh! Whoa! Far out!

02:22.345 --> 02:23.869
Aw, look at that!
- That's great.

02:23.946 --> 02:25.539
At the center of the maze,

02:25.614 --> 02:28.981
there's a magic creature
that grants wishes.

02:29.050 --> 02:30.074
"Wishes"?!

02:30.151 --> 02:32.676
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

02:32.753 --> 02:36.052
Ancient psychic
tandem war elephant!

02:36.122 --> 02:37.818
This is our chance!

02:37.890 --> 02:39.323
Hot dog!

02:39.391 --> 02:40.620
Hold on, boys!

02:40.692 --> 02:42.058
We're gonna get us some wishes!

02:44.028 --> 02:45.087
Choo-choo!

02:45.162 --> 02:47.858
Choo-choo!

02:47.930 --> 02:50.456
♪ Sing, 'cause your mama,
your mama, your mama said ♪

02:50.533 --> 02:52.592
♪ She said your mama, your
mama, your mama what? ♪

02:52.668 --> 02:53.795
♪ Whatcha mama say? ♪

02:53.869 --> 02:54.699

02:58.471 --> 03:00.201
Uh, I forgot the next part.

03:00.273 --> 03:01.468
Dang, Jake!

03:01.541 --> 03:02.940
Your body's getting thin!

03:03.008 --> 03:04.704
Hey I got a nice bod.

03:04.777 --> 03:06.711
Yeah... but right now?

03:06.778 --> 03:08.246
Uh... not so nice.

03:08.312 --> 03:11.145
Okay, well, you can take
your weird body issues

03:11.214 --> 03:13.581
and tuck them somewhere private.

03:13.650 --> 03:16.244
<i>Whereas I can take my
healthy body issues and...</i>

03:17.319 --> 03:18.581
fight a golem!

03:19.988 --> 03:21.421
Trespassers!

03:21.488 --> 03:22.421
Huh!

03:22.489 --> 03:23.422
Wrap him up, Jake!

03:23.490 --> 03:25.685
I'm on it!

03:25.758 --> 03:27.624
Stop flexing!

03:27.694 --> 03:28.894
I can't... stretch... anymore!

03:30.529 --> 03:31.861
You can do it, Jake!

03:31.930 --> 03:35.093
Stretch, stretch, stretch!
Wrap him up more!

03:41.670 --> 03:42.797
Come on, baby!

03:42.871 --> 03:45.465
Yeah!

03:51.178 --> 03:53.510
Golem... taken care of...

03:53.579 --> 03:54.774
Dudes.

03:54.847 --> 03:57.111
Jake, you're amazing!

03:58.750 --> 04:01.617
Jake, you need to take it
easy on the stretching, man.

04:01.685 --> 04:03.347
What?! N-no Jake.

04:03.420 --> 04:05.149
You can keep going, man!

04:05.221 --> 04:07.213
Right, guys! Come on, Jake!
You can go!

04:07.290 --> 04:09.849
Jake! Jake! Jake!

04:11.459 --> 04:12.392
All right.

04:12.460 --> 04:14.019
Come on, Finn.

04:14.095 --> 04:17.462
The stretchy train is
leaving the station.

04:17.529 --> 04:19.623
Choo-choo.

04:19.697 --> 04:21.963
Hmm.

04:25.369 --> 04:27.530
Just got to keep stretching!

04:27.604 --> 04:29.800
Uh... yeah.

04:30.539 --> 04:32.804
Wait! Stop, Jake. You hear that?

04:32.875 --> 04:35.969
- No.
- This place is weirding me out.

04:36.044 --> 04:38.036
Keep your eyes open
for traps and junk.

04:38.113 --> 04:39.478
<i>Whoa. Check that out.</i>

04:41.281 --> 04:43.545
Oh, snap! That's you, dude!

04:43.616 --> 04:45.175
Hmm. - Boop.

04:45.251 --> 04:47.151
Hey, man, watch it.

04:47.219 --> 04:49.484
I think that's my nerp, but,
like, super stretched out.

04:49.554 --> 04:51.784
Boop, boop!
Boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boop!

04:51.856 --> 04:55.951
Stop, man!

04:56.025 --> 04:57.357
Phoo!

04:57.426 --> 04:59.156
Nerp!

05:01.763 --> 05:02.890
Oh, my grob!

05:02.964 --> 05:04.694
It's okay!

05:04.766 --> 05:07.030
Hot dogs are immune to poison!

05:08.769 --> 05:10.134
- Sick!
- I got it!

05:13.471 --> 05:15.531
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

05:15.607 --> 05:17.541
Jake! Jake! Jake!

05:19.076 --> 05:20.737
I'm good, man.

05:20.810 --> 05:23.143
It's the small scorpions
you got to worry about.

05:23.212 --> 05:25.203
Or is that just with snakes?

05:25.280 --> 05:26.612
Ooh, nope.

05:26.681 --> 05:28.171
Wait. Poison's kicking in.

05:29.416 --> 05:30.475
No, Jake! No!

05:30.551 --> 05:31.610
Hang in there, Jake.

05:31.685 --> 05:33.550
Work through the pain!

05:33.620 --> 05:34.620
Let's get wishes!

05:34.687 --> 05:36.154
Wishes!

05:36.221 --> 05:37.814
All right, you guys.

05:37.890 --> 05:39.721
Hop on. Let's do it.

05:39.791 --> 05:41.953
I don't think this
is a good idea, man.

05:42.026 --> 05:43.460
I'm fine, brother.

05:43.527 --> 05:45.792
We'll have that war
elephant in no time.

05:45.862 --> 05:47.125
Uh... uh...

05:47.197 --> 05:49.188
okay.

06:08.479 --> 06:09.742
Whoa!

06:11.481 --> 06:14.314
Hmm.

06:14.383 --> 06:16.249
Looks like the final puzzle.

06:16.318 --> 06:18.650
You think you can stretch
up there, buddy?

06:18.719 --> 06:20.483
- Yes.
- Whoa! Jake, you okay?!

06:20.555 --> 06:23.547
Uh, yeah. I just
can't close my eyes.

06:23.623 --> 06:25.319
Lids... too tight.

06:25.392 --> 06:27.189
Okay, dude, this is too far!

06:27.259 --> 06:29.023
No more maze. We're going home.

06:29.094 --> 06:31.653
Yeah. I'm feeling a little thin.

06:31.729 --> 06:33.061
Don't stop!

06:33.131 --> 06:34.928
Take it to max!

06:34.998 --> 06:37.092
Max it! - You stretch good!

06:37.167 --> 06:39.158
Jake! Jake! Jake!

06:39.235 --> 06:41.226
Whoo!

06:41.303 --> 06:42.601
Uh... all right.

06:42.671 --> 06:45.003
Jake, no! You're gonna get hurt!

06:45.072 --> 06:47.303
- Go harder!
- Go stronger!

06:47.374 --> 06:49.342
I'm going for it!

06:49.409 --> 06:50.604
Jake, no.

06:50.677 --> 06:52.907
Jake! Jake! Jake!

06:58.583 --> 06:59.846
Done.

07:03.019 --> 07:05.783
That must be the wishes!

07:05.855 --> 07:08.483
Ki-i-i-i-tty...

07:11.192 --> 07:12.853
You did it, man.

07:12.926 --> 07:14.588
Now we can go wish for our...

07:14.661 --> 07:16.720
Ancient psychic
tandem war elephant.

07:18.598 --> 07:20.429
Got to move carefully.

07:20.498 --> 07:22.467
My internal organs are
super stretched...

07:22.534 --> 07:24.297
paper thin.

07:24.368 --> 07:27.565
I love kitties.

07:31.573 --> 07:34.065
- Wha?
- I am sorry!

07:34.142 --> 07:35.769
Aah!

07:35.843 --> 07:36.867
Jake!

07:36.944 --> 07:39.208
My insides are all mashed up.

07:39.279 --> 07:40.872
I knew we should
have turned back!

07:40.947 --> 07:43.939
You were right. I
pushed myself too far.

07:44.016 --> 07:46.644
I'll never fall victim
to peer pressure again.

07:46.718 --> 07:49.483
No.. Jake! Jake! Jake!

07:49.554 --> 07:51.784
Actually, I'll do
anything you guys want

07:51.855 --> 07:53.517
if you say my name three times.

07:54.557 --> 07:56.185
Just hang tight, buddy.

07:56.259 --> 07:57.851
I'll use my wish to save you.

07:57.926 --> 08:01.658
Congratulations, warriors.

08:01.729 --> 08:05.029
Step forward and
take your wishes!

08:05.099 --> 08:07.033
Ah! I'm gonna wish for a hat!

08:07.100 --> 08:08.932
Whoo!

08:14.005 --> 08:15.303
Who's next?

08:15.373 --> 08:17.705
Mnh-mnh. That floor got traps.

08:17.774 --> 08:20.642
Jake should stretch us across!
- Jake! Jake! Jake!

08:20.710 --> 08:22.541
Here we go!

08:23.712 --> 08:25.703
No! Jake is all jacked up!

08:25.780 --> 08:27.874
But how else can we get wishes?

08:34.654 --> 08:36.884
Jake, get up and
carry us across!

08:36.955 --> 08:38.548
But I'm too weak!

08:38.623 --> 08:41.148
Jake! Jake! Jake!

08:43.126 --> 08:44.126
Yeah!

08:45.962 --> 08:47.987
Jake! Jake!

08:48.063 --> 08:50.328
Yeah!

08:50.399 --> 08:51.991
That's it. I'm dead.

08:53.134 --> 08:54.864
Jake! Stay with me, man!

08:54.936 --> 08:57.063
- Nah.
- But we did it, okay?

08:57.137 --> 08:58.901
I can wish you out of here, man!

08:58.972 --> 09:00.633
Oh, yes.

09:00.706 --> 09:04.403
Now you may each receive
your wish for real.

09:04.475 --> 09:05.909
But be warned.

09:05.977 --> 09:07.911
There are no do-overs.

09:07.978 --> 09:09.970
Okay, so you guys should wish

09:10.047 --> 09:11.674
to get your buddies back, right?

09:11.747 --> 09:12.976
I wish for a box!

09:13.049 --> 09:14.641
Sweet!

09:14.716 --> 09:17.413
I wish to blow up! I
mean like "get big."

09:17.485 --> 09:19.510
Wow. You guys are really stupid.

09:19.586 --> 09:21.020
What do you mean?

09:21.088 --> 09:24.251
<i>Dog, you're next.
What do you wish?</i>

09:24.324 --> 09:25.417
Huh?

09:25.491 --> 09:27.652
Jake, wish for the ancient
psychic tandem war elephant!

09:27.726 --> 09:29.285
Then I'll wish to save you!

09:29.361 --> 09:30.988
Right.

09:31.062 --> 09:32.928
It's so hard to think
on an empty stomach.

09:32.997 --> 09:34.658
I wish I wasn't so hungry.

09:37.534 --> 09:39.024
You wasted your wish, man!

09:39.101 --> 09:40.694
I know.

09:40.769 --> 09:42.813
You should wish for the ancient
psychic tandem war elephant.

09:42.837 --> 09:44.362
It's what we wanted.

09:44.439 --> 09:47.033
That's crazy, man. I
gotta save your life!

09:47.107 --> 09:49.268
Do it... for... me.

09:49.342 --> 09:52.073
I... wish for...

09:52.144 --> 09:54.772
the ancient psychic
tandem war elephant.

09:54.846 --> 09:56.542
Yes!

09:56.614 --> 09:59.378
Your wish is granted.

09:59.450 --> 10:01.975
Wha?!

10:04.454 --> 10:07.321
It has to give you control!

10:07.389 --> 10:08.389
Remember!

10:08.456 --> 10:09.651
I'm on it!

10:13.026 --> 10:16.962
Ancient psychic tandem
war elephant, hear me!

10:17.029 --> 10:22.592
Finn the human, are you
worthy to command me?

10:22.667 --> 10:25.898
You know I am, because
you're psychic!

10:25.969 --> 10:28.130
Now wish for my
friends to be healed!

10:28.204 --> 10:32.299
I wish for what Finn desires!

10:32.374 --> 10:34.775
Yeah, boy!

10:34.843 --> 10:36.105
No!

10:36.176 --> 10:38.176
You weren't supposed to
have your wishes come true!

10:38.245 --> 10:39.610
You were supposed to die!

10:39.679 --> 10:42.239
Now bust us out of here.

10:42.315 --> 10:43.247
No!

10:43.315 --> 10:44.613
Yeah, boy!
