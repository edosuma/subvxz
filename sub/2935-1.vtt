00:41.182 --> 00:43.141
MUSIC IN THE BACKGROUND

00:44.303 --> 00:46.341
THUNDER

01:55.975 --> 01:58.374
No, no. This does not exist!

01:58.494 --> 02:01.253
A young sexy guy who knows how to express himself...

02:01.374 --> 02:04.973
.. classical training with a vague talent and just a bit 'of the brain in the head.'

02:05.094 --> 02:07.253
Not one who knows how to pronounce "inextricable"...

02:07.334 --> 02:08.933
.. without having done a course in diction.

02:10.734 --> 02:12.772
Well, listen... THUNDER

02:12.893 --> 02:16.252
(Marie-Cécile) Why do you say that?
Turn to some agent.

02:16.373 --> 02:19.212
These actresses, young and brave.
- Yes  I can handle it.

02:19.253 --> 02:23.091
At that time a woman was married at Vanda's age.

02:23.173 --> 02:26.331
.. had five children and had come down with tuberculosis.

02:26.453 --> 02:29.051
Instead today all girls talk like they're ten years old...

02:29.092 --> 02:32.571
.. and have breathed helium:
"Too, too cool!"

02:32.651 --> 02:34.371
"It's one thing that rocks!"

02:34.451 --> 02:37.250
I have a parade of more than thirty bitches...

02:37.371 --> 02:39.890
.. Half dressed as bitches and the other half as lesbians.

02:39.971 --> 02:42.969
Vanda or I would be better
than most of those girls.

02:43.011 --> 02:45.049
Just put on a dress and a pair of socks
you're done.

02:45.170 --> 02:46.969
Hello? Hello, darling?

02:48.290 --> 02:50.409
Oh, damn... Hello?

02:51.970 --> 02:54.129
- Fuck!
 (Vanda) Knock, knock.

02:56.089 --> 03:00.048
I arrived late, right?
Oh shit!

03:00.169 --> 03:03.168
 Holy shit! - If you are coming
for "Venus in Fur"...

03:03.289 --> 03:04.848
.. everyone left half an hour ago.

03:04.928 --> 03:07.367
I'm sorry, but I was
on the other side of Paris.

03:07.488 --> 03:09.527
My phone was charging,
I broke a heel...

03:09.648 --> 03:12.887
.. on one of those ventilation grilles
that no one knows where they are.

03:13.008 --> 03:15.007
And then there was a guy on the subway
who rubbed himself on me...

03:15.047 --> 03:16.846
.. Everything's this way.

03:16.928 --> 03:19.486
And finally, the storm came.
I'm soaked to the bone!

03:19.607 --> 03:21.766
Holy cow, it's
my day.

03:21.886 --> 03:23.805
Holy shit bitch!

03:23.926 --> 03:27.405
Maybe there's a Valium in the medicine cabinet, want to look?

03:27.526 --> 03:29.165
No, it's just my luck.

03:29.206 --> 03:31.365
Thank you, Lord,
for making my life easier.

03:31.446 --> 03:33.404
By the way, let me introduce myself.

03:33.486 --> 03:35.324
- Vanda Jourdain.
- Who? Vanda?

03:35.445 --> 03:37.324
Do you understand?

03:37.365 --> 03:38.924
I even have the right name.

03:39.006 --> 03:40.844
Do you know a lot of girls who call themselves "Vanda"?

03:40.925 --> 03:42.043
I was made for that part...

03:42.125 --> 03:45.284
.. and she takes the subway stop in the tunnel with the
turn.

03:45.364 --> 03:47.043
- And your name is?
- Thomas Novachek.

03:47.085 --> 03:49.203
Pleasure... Hey, wait a minute!

03:49.244 --> 03:51.762
- You are the author.
- Yes, well... no.

03:51.884 --> 03:53.763
I did the script.

03:53.804 --> 03:57.363
- Yes, but you are also the director, right?
- Yes, I would say yes.

03:57.403 --> 04:00.002
I love your work
at least the ones I know.

04:00.043 --> 04:03.402
"Anatomy of a shadow," great!
I saw it twice!

04:03.483 --> 04:05.162
Not me.

04:05.202 --> 04:07.481
Oh! But that was stupid.

04:07.562 --> 04:10.601
- I meant that other one.
- What other? 
- What a shame.

04:10.722 --> 04:14.680
However, this one is too radical,
at least from what I've read.

04:14.762 --> 04:17.081
Er 'rather risqué, right?
Sexy in my opinion.

04:17.201 --> 04:19.720
Or erotic, kind if you like
humiliation and stuff like that.

04:19.841 --> 04:23.200
I do not usually go around
dressed in leather wearing a dog collar...

04:23.320 --> 04:25.359
.. I'm a reserved type.

04:25.441 --> 04:28.920
But I thought that I would help me get into the
part.

04:28.960 --> 04:31.599
- It's S & M stuff?
- Not exactly.

04:31.680 --> 04:34.838
- It's set in 1870.
- Ah, I see.

04:34.920 --> 04:38.398
- Not much of this in 1870, right?
- No, not really.

04:38.439 --> 04:42.398
- Perhaps the sadomasochistic ones dressed
like this. 
- Yeah, I'll go find out.

04:42.479 --> 04:45.837
- I brought a photo and a resume.
- Very well, thank you.

04:49.238 --> 04:51.037
Where are they? Here...

04:51.998 --> 04:54.716
- Here's the picture... and the script.
- Thank you.

04:54.758 --> 04:59.637
True, it's a bit short
but I was made for this part.

04:59.677 --> 05:02.876
I starred in Hedda Gabbler
and they said I was fabulous.

05:02.917 --> 05:05.076
- The Theatre of the urinal?
- Yes

05:05.156 --> 05:08.276
I have not had the pleasure of following
their last season.

05:08.316 --> 05:10.115
You had an appointment for this audition?

05:10.197 --> 05:12.995
At 2 pm or 3... a little 'time ago.

05:13.076 --> 05:15.635
- Vanda... what did you say?
- Jourdain?

05:15.715 --> 05:18.874
Everyone always asks me if it's a stage name.

05:20.315 --> 05:23.874
I don't see your name here.

05:23.914 --> 05:27.113
Really? 
My agent swore that it was all right.

05:27.155 --> 05:30.513
- I'm not on the list?
- Please, leave.

05:30.594 --> 05:33.393
Fuck! Well, thanks, sir.

05:33.513 --> 05:37.352
- But since I'm here...
- Wait, what does?

05:37.474 --> 05:40.312
I also know the scene!

05:41.553 --> 05:43.552
- No!
- Wait!

05:43.593 --> 05:46.352
- I even have a costume.
- It's useless.

05:47.073 --> 05:51.472
- You don't want me to audition?
- I do not want to do it. No!

05:51.512 --> 05:54.751
- Since I'm here we might try.
- They're all gone.

05:54.872 --> 05:57.990
- There is no one to run your lines.
- You can do it.

05:58.111 --> 06:00.750
For me it would be an honor to have the author do the scene with me.

06:00.831 --> 06:03.030
- The author.
- Fantastic!

06:03.151 --> 06:06.750
- Directly from the author.
- Okay, stop!

06:06.831 --> 06:09.749
- To tell the truth, Miss...
- Vanda.

06:09.831 --> 06:12.629
-
Try something different. 
- Oh yeah?

06:12.750 --> 06:15.589
- Who do you want?
- Someone a bit more...

06:15.629 --> 06:17.189
.. how to say...

06:17.269 --> 06:20.548
Okay, don't try so hard.
Someone who is not me.

06:21.629 --> 06:24.588
Too short, too tall,
too old, too young...

06:24.629 --> 06:28.227
My resume is too short,
okay I understand.

06:36.948 --> 06:39.987
- But no, wait.
- I've pissed you off.

06:40.107 --> 06:42.946
- Calm down.
- It's not fair.

06:42.987 --> 06:45.706
Really, I've had enough.

06:47.667 --> 06:50.905
My day was a nightmare.

06:51.026 --> 06:53.505
You can arrange other auditions.

06:53.546 --> 06:56.985
I'm here now, I'd avoid
having to come back tomorrow.

06:57.025 --> 07:00.145
Even my day was very stressful too.

07:00.225 --> 07:02.424
I auditioned an army of failures.

07:02.506 --> 07:04.224
One even had braces on her teeth.

07:04.345 --> 07:07.343
- Now would not be the time.
- Okay. - I need to rest.

07:07.425 --> 07:09.983
- Then I'll have some for dinner.
- Yes, I understand.

07:10.104 --> 07:12.343
It will be better to do it when I'm less tired.

07:12.384 --> 07:15.983
Thank you for coming and congratulations on the dress.

07:16.103 --> 07:20.023
- I'll see you soon.
- I wish it were so, but it's nice to say it.

07:20.063 --> 07:22.702
You look like a decent person.

07:22.783 --> 07:24.622
This is a shitty job...

07:24.703 --> 07:27.862
.. not to mention the thirty euros
for this shitty costume.

07:29.422 --> 07:34.221
- Do not you find this face
"1800 something"? 
- Of course!

07:34.342 --> 07:35.781
- It is very Vanda, right?
- Very lovely.

07:35.902 --> 07:37.220
I think wearing a dress this long...

07:37.341 --> 07:38.661
.. because at that time everyone hated asses.

07:38.782 --> 07:41.421
- This is a misstatement.
- I see how it is.

07:41.501 --> 07:44.980
CELLPHONE RINGS Please, be nice!

07:45.020 --> 07:47.020
- Yes?
- Thank you.

07:47.061 --> 07:49.459
Oh, I must have lost track of the time.

07:49.580 --> 07:51.020
No, no!

07:51.100 --> 07:54.019
I am not speaking to you,
someone has just came in.

07:54.140 --> 07:56.538
No, No. I don't know.

07:58.420 --> 08:01.538
Then I'll take the sushi
just get takeout.

08:01.580 --> 08:03.258
Hello.

08:04.659 --> 08:06.738
Can you help me close it?

08:14.298 --> 08:17.536
Thomas Novachek in person will give me the lines.

08:17.618 --> 08:21.376
It won't be much help,
I'm not an actor.

08:21.497 --> 08:24.496
Come on, you're perfect.
You'll crush Kowalski.

08:24.577 --> 08:26.295
- No, Kushemski.
- Kushemski.

08:26.377 --> 08:28.816
- You are Kushemski.
- OK, all done.

08:32.655 --> 08:34.815
At your service, sir.

08:34.895 --> 08:37.455
Where do we start?
You choose. I don't care..

08:37.535 --> 08:39.614
Let's try the first scene.

08:39.696 --> 08:41.254
Okay.

08:41.294 --> 08:43.453
- It has its fair share?
- Yes

09:04.173 --> 09:07.652
- It's a bit the worse for wear.
- Is that the full text?

09:07.693 --> 09:09.491
- Who gave it to you?
- I don't know.

09:09.573 --> 09:12.571
- I got it from my agent.
- And where did he get it?

09:12.613 --> 09:16.651
Is this a problem? Is it top secret?
Should not I see it?

09:16.692 --> 09:18.970
It's not important.

09:20.051 --> 09:23.650
- Have you read it?
- Yes, in passing, on the subway.

09:23.732 --> 09:25.930
I have seen that is adapted from something.

09:26.011 --> 09:28.050
From a song by Lou Reed
"Venus in furs?"

09:28.091 --> 09:30.730
No, it is taken from a novel by an Austrian author

09:30.851 --> 09:34.570
"The Venus in Fur" by Leopold von Sacher Masoch.

09:34.650 --> 09:38.169
I bet you know how to read Austrian
and have read it in the original version.

09:38.289 --> 09:40.529
Actually yes.

09:40.570 --> 09:44.009
The book caused a scandal when it was published in 1870.

09:44.049 --> 09:46.649
I believe it!
It's a porn BDSM.

09:46.689 --> 09:49.528
- This is not a porn BDSM.
- You don't think it's porn?

09:49.568 --> 09:51.207
Not even a little?

09:51.249 --> 09:53.847
Since it was written in the Middle Ages,
in 1800 or something?

09:53.889 --> 09:56.607
"Venus in Fur"
is a beautiful love story...

09:56.648 --> 09:59.727
It's a masterpiece.
It's one of the great texts of world literature.

09:59.768 --> 10:01.926
Ah, yes? For me, it's a porno.

10:02.008 --> 10:05.287
Sadomasochism, I know what it is, I work in the theater.

10:05.367 --> 10:08.726
The term "masochism" comes from Sacher-Masoch and
from this book.

10:08.767 --> 10:12.806
Ah! Masochism-Masoch.
I get it!

10:12.846 --> 10:16.085
So this guy has given his name to sadomasochism.
Cool.

10:16.166 --> 10:18.365
- It was not his intention.
- I see.

10:18.446 --> 10:21.244
He believed he had written a good novel
and they all said it was porn.

10:21.365 --> 10:24.085
- You have plagiarized the book?
- No, I adapted it.

10:24.125 --> 10:27.724
I reinvented the dialogue, the situations and...

10:27.805 --> 10:29.884
- There is so much of me in here.
- Great!

10:30.004 --> 10:32.524
Genius! Where does it take place?

10:32.604 --> 10:36.363
In a hotel that is located on a remote
mountain in the eastern part of...

10:36.484 --> 10:40.163
.. the Imperial Austro-Hungarian Empire.
- Let me remember.

10:40.204 --> 10:43.683
- It's complicated.
- It's a nice place?

10:43.763 --> 10:46.563
Yes, it is a spa for wealthy people...

10:46.643 --> 10:48.362
.. a luxurious place.

10:48.483 --> 10:50.522
The curtain rises and Kushemski is in his room.

10:50.643 --> 10:53.402
He is reading his book while drinking coffee.

10:53.523 --> 10:55.521
And then... knock knock! Cue Vanda.

10:55.562 --> 10:59.721
It is symbolic from the point of view 
of the character?

10:59.761 --> 11:02.841
No, but there are still people who read the book.

11:02.882 --> 11:06.080
- Sometimes even the real book, on paper. 
- Ah, you caught me.

11:06.121 --> 11:09.360
This fellow, what's his name?
Sevran, Severan, Savrìne ..

11:09.441 --> 11:12.200
- Severin Von Kushemski.
- That's it..

11:12.240 --> 11:14.520
What kind of person is he?

11:14.600 --> 11:18.079
Young? Tell me some adjectives.
Something. What?

11:18.120 --> 11:22.559
Rich, idle, typical of his era,
smart traveler, cultured.

11:22.679 --> 11:25.199
- An intellectual.

11:26.040 --> 11:28.078
- So to speak.
- Ah, "so to speak." I love it.

11:28.159 --> 11:30.838
- I haven't heard anyone talk like that in a long time.
- I wouldn't know.

11:30.919 --> 11:34.158
- So she is a distinct type?
- You want me to talk about the character?

11:34.198 --> 11:36.318
Yes, I know it by heart... but
yes, please, if you like!

11:39.598 --> 11:44.117
I would say that from many points of view
she is a young woman of her time...

11:44.158 --> 11:46.036
.. in spite of the principles she professes, but...

11:46.078 --> 11:48.316
- In spite of what?
Of the principles she professes.

11:48.357 --> 11:51.956
At first glance she is a person
in place, poised and very cultured.

11:52.037 --> 11:54.235
As you say! Anything else?

11:54.317 --> 11:57.075
Something that I do not already know?

11:57.116 --> 11:59.395
Never mind, I'll manage.

12:02.116 --> 12:05.154
- Will it bother you if I change lighting?
- The lighting!

12:05.276 --> 12:07.634
It's a bit' too much, don't you think?

12:10.795 --> 12:13.154
Please,
make yourself at home.

12:26.033 --> 12:27.832
Is that better?

12:27.953 --> 12:29.512
Not bad.

12:30.233 --> 12:32.352
Wait.

12:33.233 --> 12:35.751
I don't know how to work that.

12:37.272 --> 12:39.831
OK. That's much better.

12:53.391 --> 12:55.669
I guess this is the sofa.

12:55.751 --> 12:58.190
Yes, it's the sofa.

12:59.750 --> 13:01.549
A desk?

13:02.870 --> 13:05.149
The book that is discussed?

13:05.229 --> 13:07.148
There is a postcard, fantastic!

13:15.349 --> 13:17.268
What is this?

13:17.389 --> 13:21.827
- A phallic symbol?
- There are remnants of the previous show.

13:23.388 --> 13:25.867
A Belgian production of...

13:26.988 --> 13:29.386
.. "Stagecoach"
adapted to musical comedy.

13:32.747 --> 13:34.546
Where would you like me to stand?

13:35.386 --> 13:37.266
Where do you prefer...

13:42.466 --> 13:44.265
.. less at the center.

13:44.346 --> 13:46.985
 Side yard?
- Garden.
-Garden?

13:48.946 --> 13:51.104
You want to re-read the text before you start?

13:51.225 --> 13:53.384
No, let's begin. Up to where?

13:54.584 --> 13:58.063
- End of page three.
- Okay. And then throw me out, right?

13:58.145 --> 14:01.263
- You want me to to try?
- And then throw me out.

14:01.304 --> 14:04.023
- Look, I...
 Ah, yes! I forgot...

14:04.063 --> 14:09.062
- The phrase that on the first page,
The citation.  The epigraph?

14:09.104 --> 14:10.982
Yes, that one.

14:11.023 --> 14:14.262
"The Lord Almighty
struck him and put him in the hands of a woman."

14:14.383 --> 14:18.181
Is a quote that appears in the novel,
It's taken from the Book of Judith.

14:18.222 --> 14:21.101
 It's in the Bible?
- In the Apocryphal books of the Bible, yes.

14:21.183 --> 14:23.021
I do not know anything about that.

14:23.102 --> 14:26.501
- Ah, yes.
Don't you think it's sexist?

14:26.622 --> 14:29.860
"The Lord Almighty
struck him and put him in the hands of a woman."

14:29.981 --> 14:32.580
I just mentioned the novel of Sacher-Masoch
.

14:32.621 --> 14:35.500
 Yes, but since you put it on page
zero...

14:35.581 --> 14:39.820
It does not matter, does not concern me,
I'm just an actress. But you...

14:39.900 --> 14:42.539
 Forgot the fur!

14:42.580 --> 14:45.419
- She's wearing a stole, right?
- Yes, indeed.

14:53.099 --> 14:55.497
Fur, fur...

14:55.539 --> 14:57.778
soft fur...

14:58.418 --> 15:00.577
Maybe not...

15:02.258 --> 15:04.057
This...

15:08.137 --> 15:09.656
Good ..

15:09.698 --> 15:11.736
(she begins voice warmups)
The socks are dry and the Duchess is
arch-dry.

15:11.857 --> 15:14.496
The socks are dry and the Duchess is
arch-dry.

15:16.616 --> 15:19.255
Ka ke ke ke.
Ka ke ke ke.

15:19.297 --> 15:23.615
- When you're ready.
- "The tea has cured your stubborn cough?"

15:23.736 --> 15:26.975
"If you will not leave the role."

15:27.096 --> 15:28.974
(Blows rasberries)

15:36.094 --> 15:38.133
 Toc toc.
- She enters.

15:42.334 --> 15:45.413
 Herr Doktor von Severin
Kushemski?

15:48.054 --> 15:50.372
I'm sorry if I'm bothering you.

15:50.493 --> 15:52.492
My name is Vanda von Dunayev.

15:53.133 --> 15:55.772
I am in the room above you.

15:55.893 --> 16:00.452
Last night I found this book,
a copy of "Faust"...

16:00.573 --> 16:02.851
.. with your bookmark inside.

16:02.933 --> 16:07.050
I was sitting under the birches,
near the statue of Venus.

16:11.251 --> 16:12.931
Thank you very much.

16:13.051 --> 16:16.529
I had just asked the waitress to look for it..

16:16.611 --> 16:21.449
I found it and there is a postcard inside.

16:21.571 --> 16:24.089
This is a Titian, right?

16:24.210 --> 16:25.889
 Yes

16:26.010 --> 16:28.649
"Venus in the mirror,"
one of my favorite paintings.

16:28.729 --> 16:31.368
Your Venus looks to be well used...

16:31.409 --> 16:33.208
.. just like your book.

16:33.329 --> 16:35.248
She is faithful?

16:35.369 --> 16:38.727
- Excuse me?
- Original?

16:39.568 --> 16:43.167
Yes, it is a copy...
faithful to the original.

16:43.249 --> 16:47.487
I understand your infatuation,
it's a ravishing picture.

16:47.608 --> 16:50.566
Thanks for having troubled to bring it back.

16:50.608 --> 16:54.806
I could not help noticing the strange
poem written on the back.

16:54.927 --> 16:57.566
"Venus In Fur".
Did you write it?

16:57.686 --> 17:01.886
- Those are poor, poor verses.
- Shoddy? really?

17:04.126 --> 17:07.605
"To love and be loved, or as a charm..."

17:07.646 --> 17:10.765
".. yet, stronger, more beautiful still .."

17:10.845 --> 17:13.884
".. is this torment that consumes me."

17:14.005 --> 17:17.123
"I will kiss this woman
I am a victim..."

17:17.204 --> 17:18.803
".. the slave miserable..."

17:18.924 --> 17:21.324
".. submissive, the footrest."

17:21.444 --> 17:24.042
"My goddess, my dictator..."

17:24.084 --> 17:26.123
".. my Venus in Furs."

17:28.003 --> 17:31.043
 The sentiments are interesting.

17:31.123 --> 17:34.402
If I were you, I'd take better care of this.

17:35.483 --> 17:37.642
I appreciate your discretion.

17:42.402 --> 17:45.561
Want to sit for a moment?

17:45.682 --> 17:47.481
Thank you.

17:47.562 --> 17:51.801
- May I take your coat?
- Very kind of you.

17:56.361 --> 17:58.120
This fur is a tartar, right?

17:58.161 --> 18:01.640
A sable of the Caucasus?
I would say of Kazakhstan.

18:01.720 --> 18:06.159
Yes, a tartar sable from Kazakhistan, exactly.

18:06.200 --> 18:09.199
Kushemski, standing, observes
the fur between his hands.

18:11.719 --> 18:13.958
But you are trembling Kushemski.

18:15.559 --> 18:17.718
Yes, I pray you to forgive me.

18:18.998 --> 18:22.157
- Can I get you something to drink?
- Gladly.

18:22.278 --> 18:25.637
- A coffee would be perfect.
- Then take mine.

18:25.718 --> 18:27.317
How kind!

18:27.438 --> 18:30.677
- Two lumps, please.
- He serves coffee...

18:44.676 --> 18:47.955
I hope the noise above doesn't bother you
when I walk in heels.

18:48.036 --> 18:49.755
I'd give anything in the world.

18:49.876 --> 18:52.874
To hear you walk so well in your heels.

18:52.995 --> 18:55.354
So you're a poet,
Herr Kuskhemski?

18:55.395 --> 18:57.314
A waste of time.

18:57.395 --> 18:59.713
And a passionate expert on fur?

19:00.794 --> 19:02.713
The love of fur...

19:02.795 --> 19:05.953
- Skip this measure, the following is
... - No, read it.

19:07.034 --> 19:09.633
The love of fur is innate.

19:09.674 --> 19:11.473
a passion given to all by nature.

19:11.594 --> 19:13.872
Put in a little more effort.

19:16.393 --> 19:18.912
The love of fur is innate.

19:19.032 --> 19:22.032
a passion given to all by nature.

19:22.113 --> 19:24.912
Caress a soft and thick fur...

19:25.033 --> 19:28.031
.. hear that particular crackle, that electricity...

19:28.112 --> 19:32.671
I think that it is not only a gift of nature.

19:32.712 --> 19:37.630
Your mother
wrapped you up in a sable when you were little?

19:37.711 --> 19:39.430
But that's indiscreet.

19:39.551 --> 19:41.669
 I beg your pardon.
- No, I...

19:42.670 --> 19:48.149
It was one of my aunts
who had a real passion for fur.

19:48.190 --> 19:52.709
- So that explains it.
- We are all easily explained.

19:52.750 --> 19:56.348
- But we remain intractable.
- Inextricable?

19:57.429 --> 20:00.268
- What do you mean? 
- Life makes us what we are?

20:00.308 --> 20:01.987
End of page three.

20:04.148 --> 20:06.067
THUNDER

20:07.748 --> 20:10.347
Actually yes...

20:11.307 --> 20:15.146
- That was going very well, Vanda.
- I was looking for footholds.

20:15.187 --> 20:17.586
- I did what I could.
- Seemed very solid.

20:17.707 --> 20:20.946
That's what it means to be
able to create an atmosphere.

20:21.026 --> 20:24.065
- I am a professional.
- Really, it was...

20:24.186 --> 20:26.785
- Stop it, I'll blush.
- I did not say it was perfect.

20:26.826 --> 20:29.945
- No, of course.
- Let's go on a little more.

20:30.026 --> 20:33.865
Kushemski - After that he makes his big speech...

20:33.905 --> 20:35.704
.. you go to...

20:35.786 --> 20:39.064
- Read, it helps me to get into character. Please recite.

20:39.145 --> 20:41.463
- You read well, Thomas.
- No, it's an impression.

20:41.584 --> 20:44.223
You read really well.

20:44.305 --> 20:46.703
- Have you already thought of someone for Kushemski? 
- Not really.

20:46.744 --> 20:48.903
- I have several options.
- You could do it yourself.

20:48.984 --> 20:51.423
- Yes, of course!
- I think so seriously.

20:51.504 --> 20:53.942
- You would be very good.
- No, it's quite difficult.

20:54.063 --> 20:58.502
- Does the director inflict this on all the actors?
- It is his job.

20:58.623 --> 21:01.741
- I'm directing for the first time.
- Doesn't look like it.

21:01.863 --> 21:05.302
I decided to do this because
directors never understand anything.

21:05.342 --> 21:07.261
- You have no idea what I have endured...
- That's why it's perfect.

21:07.343 --> 21:11.061
- You know what to do.
- I have everything in my head.

21:11.102 --> 21:14.940
I want to use the "Lyric Suite"
by Alban Berg for the transitions...

21:15.022 --> 21:17.341
- a great idea!
- He knows the "Lyric Suite"?

21:17.421 --> 21:19.380
No, but you understand what I mean?

21:19.501 --> 21:22.459
You know the story of the inner life,
of the characters, everything! - Yes.

21:22.501 --> 21:27.019
What accent Kushemski should have...

21:27.060 --> 21:29.459
.. or something of the kind.
- He's a distinguished man.

21:29.540 --> 21:31.459
Yes, distinguished 
- And with that, I don't know...

21:31.499 --> 21:33.259
.. an aristocrat.

21:33.299 --> 21:36.178
he moves like this...

21:36.260 --> 21:38.578
Or is that just stupid?

21:38.699 --> 21:41.698
a little.
It's silly but it is fantastic.

21:41.819 --> 21:45.257
- For this scene he would wear
a dressing gown? - Yes

21:47.338 --> 21:49.617
- You're joking!
- Want to try it?

21:50.818 --> 21:53.657
Buck up, I'll help.

21:56.097 --> 21:57.896
But it is magnificent.

21:58.017 --> 22:01.376
- Am I wrong or is it vintage?
- So I'm told.

22:01.457 --> 22:03.416
Siegfried Mueller...

22:03.497 --> 22:05.456
.. Vienna...

22:06.177 --> 22:08.415
.. 1869.

22:10.376 --> 22:12.175
I hadn't seen that.

22:12.256 --> 22:14.454
40 euros at the flea market.

22:30.894 --> 22:33.413
Seems tailor-made for him.

22:33.534 --> 22:36.053
- How does it look?
- Very good.

22:36.174 --> 22:38.452
It is close to my size.

22:38.573 --> 22:41.212
- You look great.
- Yes

22:46.012 --> 22:47.771
Hello, sweet guy.

22:47.812 --> 22:50.052
And the dog collar?

22:50.092 --> 22:53.090
It is a reminder of the period in which I beat the pavement.

22:54.132 --> 22:56.810
Joke!

22:56.892 --> 22:58.971
Let's pick up a few lines back.

23:04.131 --> 23:08.649
Your mother
wrapped you up in a sable when you were a little baby?

23:08.691 --> 23:11.329
That was indiscreet,
please forgive me.

23:11.410 --> 23:15.289
It was one of my aunts
who had a real passion for fur.

23:15.370 --> 23:18.009
- For him it is tough to say this.
- Yes, it's no wonder.

23:18.049 --> 23:20.288
- Then take courage.
- Yes

23:21.409 --> 23:24.288
That was indiscreet,
please forgive me.

23:26.889 --> 23:32.087
It was one of my aunts
who had a real passion for fur.

23:32.168 --> 23:36.886
- So that explains it.
- We are all easily explained.

23:36.968 --> 23:39.407
But we remain inexplainable.

23:39.527 --> 23:41.526
Inexplainable?

23:41.567 --> 23:42.766
What do you mean?

23:42.847 --> 23:47.526
Life makes us what we are
in an unpredictable moment.

23:49.486 --> 23:51.165
Is the coffee to your liking?

23:51.246 --> 23:54.285
I just tasted it. It's excellent.

23:54.405 --> 23:57.525
This is symbolic, right?
The coffee is...

23:57.605 --> 24:00.484
.. and she has just tasted
but is already excited.

24:00.525 --> 24:02.684
Ln fact, I was suprised.

24:05.445 --> 24:09.123
Have you ever experienced such a surprising moment
Mister Kushemski?

24:09.165 --> 24:12.883
In reality, yes, but I will not bother you.

24:12.964 --> 24:15.283
On the contrary, it fascinates me.

24:15.364 --> 24:17.763
Like one of those English detective novels

24:17.804 --> 24:21.243
He had a mysterious aunt who loved fur.

24:21.283 --> 24:25.842
- We could skip this part.
- No, read it. I want to hear it.

24:25.923 --> 24:29.521
He had a mysterious aunt who loved fur.

24:30.602 --> 24:32.801
I was a child from hell...

24:32.922 --> 24:35.521
.. spoiled and cruel.

24:35.562 --> 24:38.401
Mean to our maids and our cat.

24:38.441 --> 24:42.280
I behaved very badly with one of my aunts.

24:42.401 --> 24:47.800
The Countess was a woman
majestic, voluptuous and terrible ..

24:48.761 --> 24:51.039
- What is it?
- Nothing.

24:51.120 --> 24:53.799
just saying aloud the words that I wrote
...

24:53.920 --> 24:55.719
.. two in the morning on a screen
looked different.

24:55.839 --> 24:58.119
You're doing great!

24:58.199 --> 24:59.919
What did your aunt do?

25:01.319 --> 25:03.158
One evening he is avenged.

25:05.799 --> 25:07.798
She came into my room...

25:07.839 --> 25:12.958
.. with her big black Russian fox coat

25:13.118 --> 25:18.277
In her hand she held a rod,
a branch of birch...

25:18.357 --> 25:21.876
..
With her were the cook and the maid.

25:23.437 --> 25:26.396
She took off her coat and she rolled up his sleeves...

25:26.437 --> 25:29.396
.. I tried to escape...

25:29.436 --> 25:31.915
.. but the other two women
took hold of me,..

25:31.956 --> 25:36.635
I lowered my pants and she threw me on the fur.

25:37.916 --> 25:42.954
I held still while my aunt
punished me with the rod.

25:44.315 --> 25:47.793
My buttocks and my
naked thighs were on fire.

25:48.995 --> 25:51.874
The maid encouraged her.

25:51.954 --> 25:55.953
She made fun of me, treated me like a sissy

25:56.074 --> 25:59.433
I danced away but my aunt continued to hit me...

26:00.634 --> 26:04.712
.. until such time as
I begged her to stop...

26:04.833 --> 26:06.632
.. out of pity.

26:08.553 --> 26:12.872
When she finally stopped,
she forced me to thank her...

26:12.992 --> 26:15.391
.. and kiss her feet.

26:16.591 --> 26:21.111
Then she left room
threatening to come back.

26:21.151 --> 26:24.111
And all this in the presence of the
maids...

26:24.151 --> 26:26.550
.. and our cat.

26:26.631 --> 26:28.549
From that moment...

26:28.591 --> 26:32.389
.. fur to me more than simple fur...

26:32.430 --> 26:35.189
.. nor a birch branch
a simple branch.

26:35.310 --> 26:39.388
In a moment she made me who I am...

26:42.949 --> 26:44.788
- And she came back?
- Yes

26:44.869 --> 26:48.508
In my dreams, with her black fur
and her rod.

26:48.629 --> 26:51.388
She comes to visit me again,
night after night.

26:51.509 --> 26:54.387
- My poor friend.
 Poor?

26:55.828 --> 26:58.547
She taught me the most valuable thing in the world

26:58.588 --> 27:02.986
- And what did she teach you?
- That nothing is more sensual than pain.

27:03.027 --> 27:06.506
That nothing is more exciting
than degradation.

27:06.627 --> 27:08.626
The Countess did her job well.

27:09.347 --> 27:11.506
It has become my ideal.

27:11.547 --> 27:14.545
From that day I seek her double.

27:14.626 --> 27:18.024
And when I meet this woman I will marry her.

27:18.146 --> 27:21.265
This step is sensational!

27:21.345 --> 27:24.144
Thanks, it took a lot of work.

27:24.225 --> 27:28.904
In practical terms, it's like a play
child abuse?

27:31.705 --> 27:33.743
It has nothing to do with it.

27:33.864 --> 27:37.783
What the fuck does the maltreatment of children 
have to do with this story?

27:37.824 --> 27:40.942
Holy cow, this craze nowadays...

27:41.024 --> 27:42.742
.. bring everything to a social problem of cock.

27:42.824 --> 27:46.662
- The abuse is not only...
- Do not follow stereotypes!

27:46.703 --> 27:50.182
Do not talk about anthropology or sociology!

27:50.303 --> 27:51.982
- Let's make theater.
- Yes, but...

27:52.062 --> 27:55.941
Here there is much more at stake than
the issue of corporal punishment.

27:56.022 --> 27:58.101
Okay, I'm sorry!

27:58.182 --> 28:00.820
Most of the world live impoverished
and dull lives!

28:00.862 --> 28:04.100
Why do we always try to bring
everything to something else?

28:04.181 --> 28:08.620
What else will we pull out now?
sexism, racism, class struggle?

28:08.661 --> 28:11.300
Well, you're certainly unique,
Herr Kushemski.

28:11.421 --> 28:14.299
If I were you, I would be careful.

28:15.140 --> 28:18.819
Your ideal woman could prove
more cruel than desired.

28:18.860 --> 28:21.099
I am ready to take the risk.

28:21.139 --> 28:24.818
I know what she is...
A supersensual person.

28:24.859 --> 28:26.738
An ascetic of pleasure.

28:26.779 --> 28:30.618
And you, Frau von Vanda Dunayev,
who or what are you?

28:30.739 --> 28:32.377
I am a pagan.

28:32.419 --> 28:35.297
Does that mean I'm young,
beautiful, rich...

28:35.378 --> 28:38.137
.. and by that account able to derive 
more benefits than possible to others.

28:38.178 --> 28:40.176
I do not deny anything.

28:40.218 --> 28:42.737
I have the utmost respect for your principles.

28:42.858 --> 28:45.696
I beg your pardon, but I do not care
for your respect.

28:45.737 --> 28:47.256
I shall love the man in whom I take delight...

28:47.297 --> 28:49.696
.. and take pleasure from the man 
who will make me happy...

28:49.817 --> 28:53.976
.. but only until he ceases to
make me happy and then I'll find another.

28:54.016 --> 28:57.375
For a man there is no greater cruelty
than the infidelity of a woman.

28:57.496 --> 29:00.135
For a woman, it gets worse:
forced loyalty.

29:00.256 --> 29:03.455
- I can move?
- Yes, yes... go ahead, move.

29:08.895 --> 29:10.694
In our society...

29:10.815 --> 29:14.134
woman can have power except through the intercession of a man.

29:14.174 --> 29:17.653
What will become of the woman,
when she becomes equal to men?

29:17.735 --> 29:20.053
When she becomes herself?

29:20.134 --> 29:24.492
The Little Vanda is way
ahead of her time!

29:24.613 --> 29:28.212
How do you know all the lines?

29:28.333 --> 29:31.932
- I don't know. I learn quickly.
- You know all the text by heart!

29:32.012 --> 29:35.771
You had said that Vanda
is very much in place in spite of what?

29:35.892 --> 29:38.611
- Of the principles she professes.
- There are those. - Yes

29:38.652 --> 29:40.771
According to her Vanda does not believe in all these stories.

29:40.812 --> 29:43.771
'what it says...
Women's Rights, blah blah blah...

29:43.811 --> 29:45.730
But she does, jerk7,
She has character, a mind of her own.

29:45.851 --> 29:48.330
As said: "
the principles she professes" and not "her principles."

29:48.371 --> 29:52.090
I think I very much liked the alliteration:
"of the principles she professes."

29:52.211 --> 29:53.890
I see!

29:54.011 --> 29:56.489
He sold his soul for alliteration.

29:56.531 --> 29:58.569
'true, I plead guilty.

29:58.690 --> 30:02.168
Just between us, Thomas,
she is a true tomboy.

30:03.250 --> 30:05.409
If you allow, I would say that...

30:05.529 --> 30:08.408
You are better than a pagan.
Seems to me you are a goddess.

30:08.489 --> 30:10.807
- Really? And what?
- Venus.

30:10.889 --> 30:13.648
And Vanda?
Is Venus really me or am I making this up?

30:13.688 --> 30:17.648
Venus took the likeness of a 
human to come to haunt him?

30:17.768 --> 30:19.567
Not really.

30:19.688 --> 30:23.367
- Or rather, not exactly.
- Okay, it's so, and she wanted it.

30:23.408 --> 30:26.527
- She wants it to be ambivalent.
- Ambiguous. - Yes, that one.

30:26.607 --> 30:29.366
In fact it is the story of "The Bacchae."

30:29.407 --> 30:32.286
Exactly.
What was "The Bacchae"?

30:32.407 --> 30:35.886
- It's an old play, right?
- It's a very old play.

30:36.007 --> 30:39.925
"Citizens of Corinth.
I stand before you a Testiculus...

30:39.966 --> 30:43.085
.. a poor mortal cursed by the gods for his offenses...

30:43.166 --> 30:46.445
.. and totally fucked up till the end of time."

30:46.525 --> 30:49.444
- It's this kind of play?
- Yes

30:49.525 --> 30:53.764
Dionysus descends to Earth and is the arrogant king of Thebes...

30:53.884 --> 30:57.124
A quivering jelly dressed as a woman.
- It looks exciting.

30:57.244 --> 31:01.563
After that, the wild women of Thebes
The Bacchae, broke him in pieces.

31:01.644 --> 31:05.402
- And Dionysus returns to his home, triumphant.
- I think I saw it.

31:05.484 --> 31:08.243
In our case, however, it is not
Dionysus but Aphrodite.

31:08.283 --> 31:09.842
Of course.
Who is that?

31:09.963 --> 31:12.482
- She is the Greek version of Venus.
- But it is the same person.

31:12.563 --> 31:15.961
 The same goddess.
- Hail Aphrodite!

31:16.043 --> 31:19.561
Hail, oh Aphrodite.
Am I unbearably pedantic?

31:19.643 --> 31:21.361
Yes, but I find it cute.

31:22.801 --> 31:24.441
Yes.

31:27.961 --> 31:29.641
What do we do?

31:32.400 --> 31:34.920
Seems to me a goddess...

31:35.001 --> 31:37.280
Really? What?

31:37.321 --> 31:39.599
Venus.

31:39.720 --> 31:42.479
But Venus can rule only in a world of slaves.

31:42.600 --> 31:44.878
 Then I'd better find one.

31:44.960 --> 31:48.358
 Would you like to be my slave,
Kushemski Herr Doktor?

31:48.440 --> 31:49.918
I already am.

31:51.439 --> 31:54.678
I became your slave
the moment you entered this room.

31:54.719 --> 31:57.237
Really? Are you already in love with me?

31:57.358 --> 31:59.238
Deeply.

31:59.998 --> 32:03.116
I am suffering as if I knew it all along.

32:03.238 --> 32:06.677
- Submit to me.
- Stand up straight and turn away from me.

32:06.717 --> 32:09.677
I must confess this intrigues me.

32:09.717 --> 32:12.716
I love your frankness and the clarity of your thought.

32:12.797 --> 32:15.796
From a physical point of view,
You have charms, no doubt.

32:15.837 --> 32:18.675
But if a man submits himself to me, I set a trap...

32:18.717 --> 32:21.235
I don't care about traps. 
Love me!

32:21.356 --> 32:25.914
- You see? He has already begun to give orders. 
- Marry me!

32:25.996 --> 32:28.274
I am a frivolous woman,
Herr Kushemski.

32:28.316 --> 32:31.914
To love me, you will have to give proof of great courage
.

32:31.995 --> 32:34.793
- I have already explained my principles.
- I do not care.

32:34.875 --> 32:37.153
- I want you to be my wife.
- You do not know anything about me.

32:37.195 --> 32:39.353
- I submit to you
- That's absurd.

32:39.474 --> 32:42.793
I'll give you complete power over me,
for eternity.

32:42.834 --> 32:45.792
Do with me what you wish.

32:45.834 --> 32:50.472
- I submit, hit me if you want.
- This is unexpected news to me.

32:52.153 --> 32:54.352
- Let's try it a new way.
- What way?

32:54.433 --> 32:56.871
- Put yourself center stage upstage.
- No, I'm fine here.

32:56.953 --> 32:58.872
You should move there!

32:58.913 --> 33:02.151
Take the power and stand in a position of power.

33:04.632 --> 33:06.431
OK. Continue.

33:10.191 --> 33:13.150
- This is unexpected news to me.
- This isn't working.

33:13.191 --> 33:15.350
Do not move, try it here.

33:15.471 --> 33:18.589
I'll give you complete power over me
for eternity, unconditionally.

33:18.710 --> 33:21.589
Do with me what you want.
I submit.

33:21.710 --> 33:23.349
Hit me if you want.

33:23.390 --> 33:26.989
- This is unexpected news to me.
- You don't even pretend to try?

33:27.069 --> 33:29.828
You wanted me to go here,
So I went here.

33:29.870 --> 33:31.508
It's just an audition.

33:31.550 --> 33:34.668
I am listening also to see if you agree.

33:34.789 --> 33:36.948
Do what I say and stay there.

33:37.068 --> 33:40.627
I'll give you complete power over me
for eternity, unconditionally.

33:40.668 --> 33:42.907
Do with me what you want.
I submit.

33:42.948 --> 33:46.427
- You can hit me if you want.
- This unexpected news to me.

33:47.388 --> 33:49.787
- You're right, it's better.
- Continue.

33:52.187 --> 33:54.306
What do you want in the depths of your heart?

33:54.347 --> 33:56.265
To belong to you...

33:56.386 --> 33:58.865
..
to disappear in essence sublime...

33:58.906 --> 34:00.466
.. to dress you and undress you...

34:00.546 --> 34:03.185
.. to offer you stockings,
to put on your shoes .. .

34:03.226 --> 34:04.785
.. to no longer have my own will.

34:04.866 --> 34:07.904
 And that you call that love?
- It's the only love there is.

34:07.986 --> 34:12.304
In love, as in politics
only one of the parties must have the power.

34:12.344 --> 34:15.344
One must be the hammer and the other the anvil.

34:15.425 --> 34:19.143
I gladly accept
to be the anvil.

34:23.103 --> 34:24.902
Enough.

34:24.944 --> 34:27.223
Go on, I like it!

34:27.344 --> 34:31.023
Thomas, you are intelligence,
especially with regard to women.

34:31.063 --> 34:34.661
- You really understand women.
- Yes, yes... years of study.

34:36.463 --> 34:38.742
- Where was I?
- You are an anvil.

34:40.503 --> 34:44.701
Vanda, I try
my pain is your pleasure.

34:44.742 --> 34:48.341
You should not ever let
the feelings of others dominate.

34:48.422 --> 34:51.221
The servant of his mistress lives to serve her.

34:51.342 --> 34:53.860
I submit, squeeze me like a lemon.

34:53.981 --> 34:55.380
You are incredible.

34:55.420 --> 34:58.659
If you do not want me as a husband,
take me as a slave.

34:58.741 --> 35:01.060
Treat me with divine cruelty.

35:01.180 --> 35:03.420
Why should I mistreat those who love me?

35:03.460 --> 35:06.099
- But I'd love it even more.
- I do not want to be adored.

35:06.180 --> 35:08.859
All women want to be worshiped, as our Creator.

35:08.980 --> 35:12.218
I am created! I am ruined!
I am reduced to a thing!

35:12.299 --> 35:14.378
CELLPHONE RINGS

35:15.299 --> 35:17.258
One moment, please excuse me.

35:28.658 --> 35:30.577
 Hello? Yes

35:32.618 --> 35:36.296
No, they are not out yet.

35:37.617 --> 35:39.935
It's all right.

35:40.056 --> 35:42.776
It's all good just...

35:42.816 --> 35:44.855
I don't know.

35:44.977 --> 35:47.015
At times, eh?

35:47.856 --> 35:50.614
I'll call you when I get out?

35:50.696 --> 35:53.014
Yeah, me too, my love.

35:53.135 --> 35:55.174
- Yeah, so...
 Yes, all right.

35:55.295 --> 35:56.974
Excuse me, huh?

35:58.535 --> 36:00.574
You're not listening.

36:02.014 --> 36:05.253
 This time it's a temporary agency,
maybe they have something for me?

36:06.214 --> 36:09.893
A typist? Night work
in a major law firm.

36:09.934 --> 36:11.693
The contract is for tomorrow.
Blah Blah Blah

36:13.173 --> 36:15.172
 I don't know!

36:15.213 --> 36:17.252
What will be, will be.

36:17.373 --> 36:19.411
That's life. That's life little one. Bye!

36:21.413 --> 36:24.052
- Crazy!
- Your better half?

36:24.092 --> 36:27.211
 You think so?
- What did you call him?

36:27.332 --> 36:30.410
- I don't know... asshole?
- Ah, okay.

36:30.452 --> 36:34.290
- You wonder why I lied to you?
- No, it does not concern me.

36:34.411 --> 36:36.210
Why do you say that Vanda?

36:36.331 --> 36:39.449
"I do not deny anything,
There are other fish in the sea."

36:39.531 --> 36:42.690
- Why do you talk like that?
- You're the hammer, he's the anvil.

36:42.770 --> 36:45.170
What should I say?
"Yes, dear, whatever you want"?

36:45.210 --> 36:47.369
This has nothing to do with love, but with
my ass.

36:47.450 --> 36:49.489
If I say so,
You have to take it.

36:49.530 --> 36:52.048
- This is dialogue from the play.
- Oh yeah?

36:52.130 --> 36:54.568
You're making fun of me?

36:55.849 --> 36:58.288
- I do not know, do you think I am?
- Will you stop pretending.

36:58.369 --> 37:00.567
For once I cannot tell
what you are thinking.

37:00.649 --> 37:02.728
Talking with you is more complicated than
doing the tango.

37:02.849 --> 37:05.247
Want to go for a coffee?

37:05.329 --> 37:07.527
Why do you say that?

37:07.608 --> 37:10.047
- You're hitting on me?
- Absolutely not!

37:10.167 --> 37:12.327
I'm just offering you a coffee.

37:12.408 --> 37:16.167
- But it's symbolic coffee.
- No, no, it's a real coffee.

37:16.287 --> 37:19.726
What would she say if your wife saw you give me a "real coffee"?

37:20.967 --> 37:22.765
- I'm not married.
- Ah yes...

37:22.887 --> 37:25.405
I thought so before the phone call.

37:25.487 --> 37:27.445
- It was my fiancee.
- It's the same thing.

37:27.526 --> 37:29.484
You would think that?
In an interview you said:

37:29.566 --> 37:32.364
"The theater is the best way to get girls into bed."

37:32.486 --> 37:34.764
Don't tell me that you read that stuff.

37:34.845 --> 37:38.084
I was young,
it was my first interview.

37:38.125 --> 37:40.764
- You have never been married?
- Never.

37:42.404 --> 37:46.363
- You still live with your mother?
- I'm weird, but not that weird.

37:46.404 --> 37:49.003
I fox fur her passion?

37:49.044 --> 37:52.282
- No, it's love.
- She is really strange.

37:52.403 --> 37:54.403
 And I want my woman to be my muse.

37:54.443 --> 37:57.682
So your girlfriend has a pair of wings and everything else?

37:57.763 --> 38:00.562
In the vision of love one must jump completely in.

38:00.643 --> 38:03.282
 And she dives right in?
- Yes, like a fish...

38:03.323 --> 38:06.281
.. with fireworks,
dizziness and thunder.

38:08.202 --> 38:10.241
So, coffee yes? Or no coffee?

38:11.721 --> 38:15.920
I can't conceive of a man giving me
his life only by becoming my slave.

38:16.041 --> 38:19.400
I would say that we are not at all compatible
Herr Kushemski.

38:19.521 --> 38:21.560
We will cancel each other out.

38:21.641 --> 38:25.039
And I would say that we are made for each other.

38:25.160 --> 38:29.119
Is that not what he feels, Vanda?
Is not that what you feel?

38:29.200 --> 38:33.759
I propose we try a contract, as in business.

38:33.799 --> 38:37.759
You will have a year to prove
you are the man I need.

38:37.879 --> 38:40.118
- A year is a long time.
- I have not finished yet.

38:40.159 --> 38:45.877
- I beg your pardon.
- You will be my slave for a year.

38:47.478 --> 38:50.197
So you prepared everything.

38:50.238 --> 38:52.637
You planned everything before entering here.

38:52.718 --> 38:55.957
- Do you believe that?
- Stop being naive.

38:55.998 --> 38:59.476
- It's you, you're the author of this. 
- I'm not sure I had everything ready.

38:59.597 --> 39:01.635
I'm being sincere, I swear.

39:02.196 --> 39:03.995
So you wanted this? You seem ambivalent.

39:04.037 --> 39:05.955
- Ambiguous.
- That yes.

39:06.036 --> 39:08.235
Or is it a slut you crave,
ready to enjoy everything.

39:08.356 --> 39:10.995
A craving whore?
I had never thought of you as that.

39:11.116 --> 39:12.875
It can be even more complicated.

39:12.916 --> 39:15.315
"Be my slave for a year
and then I'll let you fuck me."

39:15.436 --> 39:17.115
- She is always ambivalent, right?
- Ambiguous.

39:17.236 --> 39:21.274
- Ambiguous. - From my point of view, rather than 
Kushemski's...

39:21.315 --> 39:24.153
This could be his last chance. Maybe the only one.

39:24.195 --> 39:25.633
And to do what?

39:26.715 --> 39:28.273
- To live.
- Ok, good.

39:28.355 --> 39:30.793
He loves the whip and wants to know if
she likes it too.

39:30.914 --> 39:33.793
- He told her this?
- She understands him.

39:33.914 --> 39:38.233
He is a weirdo and she is an object,
like all women of the 1800s.

39:39.553 --> 39:40.992
What?

39:41.113 --> 39:44.831
Who is she, then,
Frau Vanda Jourdain?

39:44.913 --> 39:47.231
- I am a pagan.
- No, I'm serious.

39:47.352 --> 39:49.391
Try again.

39:49.512 --> 39:51.671
Where did you get this?
What is your story?

39:54.072 --> 39:56.591
Daughter of the military, grew up around soldiers,
An orphan.

39:56.712 --> 39:59.590
Where have you been? ln which cities
and which countries?

40:00.551 --> 40:04.749
I will write a contract stipulating
that you will be my slave for a year.

40:07.271 --> 40:09.429
- I'll be at your command.
- Done deal.

40:10.750 --> 40:12.909
Let's shake on it.

40:29.669 --> 40:33.386
- There's a real Greek at the hotel.
 A Greek? - Yes

40:34.347 --> 40:35.706
He's from Athens.

40:35.828 --> 40:40.146
Mounts a stallion as white as snow
wearing boots and black leather.

40:40.228 --> 40:42.426
I want you to get me the number of his room.

40:42.547 --> 40:45.386
- But, Vanda...
 What is it?

40:45.427 --> 40:48.986
- Already reluctant to obey me?
- I beg your pardon.

40:49.986 --> 40:54.784
Tomorrow I'll wait in the birch forest, near the statue of Aphrodite.

40:54.866 --> 40:58.624
- At what time?  
Wait for me until such time as I decide to come.

40:58.706 --> 41:03.784
- Very good. - Don't come
without the room number of the Greek.

41:05.825 --> 41:07.263
Now kiss my foot.

41:07.824 --> 41:10.023
And he kneels and kisses her foot.

41:11.704 --> 41:14.102
I love this part, it is very direct.

41:16.104 --> 41:17.822
Pass me my fur now.

41:40.981 --> 41:44.540
Séverin, how will it end?

41:45.780 --> 41:50.420
This depends only on you, Vanda
Frau von Dunayev, not on me.

41:51.500 --> 41:53.939
Thanks for the coffee, slave.

41:55.860 --> 41:59.339
OK, I'm leaving right now.
A coffee sounds good.

42:00.300 --> 42:03.658
That was intense.
The handshake was electric.

42:03.779 --> 42:06.978
The happiness of a time when people were more introverted.

42:07.019 --> 42:10.018
A simple conversation emanated eroticism.

42:10.138 --> 42:13.217
Conversation.
The only thing to put between your teeth.

42:13.258 --> 42:15.777
The book begins like this, right?

42:16.818 --> 42:18.056
- The book?
- Yes

42:18.138 --> 42:19.737
Where is the beginning scene...

42:19.817 --> 42:22.937
.. when Venus appears to be naked
wearing fur in front of the fireplace?

42:22.977 --> 42:28.096
- You've read "The Venus in Furs"?
- I looked it over.

42:28.137 --> 42:31.375
When you said you did not know about it
you lied.

42:31.496 --> 42:33.735
OK, I lied a little.

42:33.776 --> 42:38.095
- Why didn't you keep that scene?
- I did not know how to use it.

42:38.215 --> 42:41.334
Just put it at the beginning, before the
guy with Vanda.

42:41.455 --> 42:44.294
You can not think of doing
"The Venus in Furs" without Venus.

42:44.335 --> 42:46.334
You can use the same actress
for Vanda and Venus.

42:46.375 --> 42:50.413
- Naked on stage? That's no problem.
- Yes, I'll think about it.

42:50.455 --> 42:53.693
- Why don't we improvise? 
It'll give you some ideas. 
- How?

42:53.774 --> 42:55.613
You have to change the lights.

42:55.694 --> 42:58.693
- Where we are at the beginning of the play?
- In Kushemski's room...

42:58.733 --> 43:00.613
.. in the middle of the night.

43:00.653 --> 43:03.292
Ok, middle of the night, two in the
morning.

43:03.973 --> 43:06.012
Let's turn them down a little...

43:10.093 --> 43:13.851
Fire in the fireplace,
side garden. There!

43:13.932 --> 43:16.811
Yes, very well.

43:19.012 --> 43:22.210
Kushemski What are you doing?

43:23.331 --> 43:26.450
- I do not know... is he in bed?
- What a fantasy!

43:26.570 --> 43:28.970
Too obvious?

43:29.050 --> 43:31.249
He is reading
when he meets Vanda.

43:31.370 --> 43:34.489
Do not read too early,
we are not in the library.

43:35.810 --> 43:38.569
Perhaps he could be writing in his diary.

43:38.649 --> 43:40.008
I like that.

43:47.568 --> 43:49.207
Yes

44:29.325 --> 44:31.364
OK I'm Venus.

44:32.884 --> 44:34.723
Ah shit, who cares?

44:36.964 --> 44:40.802
 Face me as if you were naked.
- You're hitting on me?

44:40.844 --> 44:43.562
Imagine that I'm your girlfriend
and this is unexpected.

44:43.604 --> 44:46.922
- Ah, it's the first time I've done this.
- You say that to all the girls.

44:46.963 --> 44:49.082
Yes, but for me it is the truth.

44:49.122 --> 44:52.601
The fire in the fireplace comes to life, we see Venus naked...

44:52.722 --> 44:55.921
.. lasciviously wrapped in a fur coat...
- Uh huh

44:55.962 --> 44:58.201
Now wrap me in fur.

44:58.242 --> 45:00.001
You're the director.

45:06.641 --> 45:08.440
I said "lascivious."

45:19.360 --> 45:21.599
Now you go to the desk.

45:34.238 --> 45:36.397
Become the character.

45:40.198 --> 45:42.236
Write in his diary.

45:46.438 --> 45:48.836
- Really write.
- I'm doing it.

45:48.877 --> 45:52.316
But out loud, we are in the theater!
If not, how do we know who he is?

45:52.356 --> 45:54.516
We are at the beginning of the play.

45:54.637 --> 45:57.395
The scene is illuminated little by little...

45:57.476 --> 46:00.154
We hear the ticking of a grandfather clock.

46:00.276 --> 46:02.555
Tic tac...

46:02.675 --> 46:05.154
.. tick...

46:05.995 --> 46:08.194
.. tick...

46:08.915 --> 46:10.474
.. tic tac!

46:11.515 --> 46:14.553
October 22, 1870.

46:15.754 --> 46:17.673
Two in the morning.

46:18.994 --> 46:22.353
Living in a spa...

46:23.673 --> 46:26.992
.. surrounded by forests and mountains.

46:27.033 --> 46:31.311
It's a moonless night,
darkness and silence reign.

46:31.353 --> 46:35.912
(VANDA WHISTLING)
A Moment! I hear a sparrow.

46:36.032 --> 46:38.071
- A nightingale.
- A nightingale.

46:39.272 --> 46:40.911
VANDA MEOWS

46:42.271 --> 46:44.790
And the cry of a cat in heat.

46:47.191 --> 46:50.190
I feel terribly alone...

46:51.990 --> 46:55.069
.. unhappy, unfulfilled.

46:55.111 --> 46:57.149
(In German) Good evening Sir.

46:57.230 --> 47:00.229
Well, the Germans have invaded again?

47:00.270 --> 47:02.909
 I hope I did not disturb you.

47:05.550 --> 47:07.548
Absolutely not.

47:12.749 --> 47:14.787
Hail, Aphrodite.

47:14.869 --> 47:18.747
- So now you have not forgotten me?
- Forget?

47:18.828 --> 47:21.987
My most dear old enemy?

47:22.108 --> 47:24.587
- You're too kind.
- Yes

47:24.627 --> 47:27.986
I do not have a right to a little kiss?

47:38.546 --> 47:43.185
- That's better, but Thomas...
- Oh! - I told Thomas? Oops!

47:43.226 --> 47:47.664
It's so cold in here!

47:47.786 --> 47:51.224
Every time I come to visit you,
I am cold.

47:51.265 --> 47:53.904
(SNEEZES) See?

47:53.984 --> 47:55.823
I already catching a cold.

47:55.944 --> 47:58.823
If you dodidn't pass the time
walking around naked...

47:58.905 --> 48:01.783
However, I am Venus,
I have to be naked.

48:01.824 --> 48:03.862
It is part of the job.

48:04.784 --> 48:09.862
Do not you want to take off those rough clothes
and come here and hold me close to you?

48:09.983 --> 48:13.222
There is so much room here under my fur.

48:13.342 --> 48:15.622
No, thank you.

48:15.743 --> 48:21.021
I brought this vision to you,
directly from Olympus.

48:21.142 --> 48:23.021
It is divine!

48:23.061 --> 48:26.421
- Do you not see the label?
Made in Olympus.  

48:26.501 --> 48:28.700
Why should I care about your vision?

48:28.821 --> 48:32.260
I know your small flaw.

48:32.301 --> 48:35.180
You're not interested in women.

48:35.300 --> 48:39.499
You just like their fur,
should marry an otter.

48:39.621 --> 48:42.819
I understand it better with an otter
than with a woman.

48:42.860 --> 48:46.579
But if I spread legs under my mink...

48:46.699 --> 48:49.338
.. would you refuse a little love?

48:49.419 --> 48:51.738
 Is it t 'a little' love you suggest?

48:51.859 --> 48:54.138
No, it is the power that interests you.

48:54.259 --> 48:56.738
- Dare you resist me?
- Yes, I dare.

48:56.778 --> 49:00.737
Séférin, I want you on the ground,
at my feet.

49:00.818 --> 49:03.137
- Beg me.
- Never.

49:03.978 --> 49:08.537
You already belong to me and I will belong
until the end of time.

49:08.617 --> 49:11.976
- Never.
- (In German) Goodbye my friend.

49:12.017 --> 49:14.176
I'll be back.

49:15.137 --> 49:17.176
And then, poof, she disappears.

49:17.256 --> 49:19.536
 Whew!
- Not bad, eh?

49:19.576 --> 49:23.615
- Not bad?... - You could 
write it down and put it in a play.

49:23.655 --> 49:25.334
That's a good idea.

49:25.416 --> 49:30.854
- In this context... - her accent 
could be like Marlene Dietrich.

49:30.935 --> 49:33.374
Yes, that would work very well.

49:33.495 --> 49:35.294
This gives a different picture of Kushemski.

49:35.415 --> 49:39.613
Yes, in the middle of the night there is
a vision of Venus...

49:39.695 --> 49:42.613
.. and then the next morning with Vanda:
"I saw her, I beg you."

49:42.734 --> 49:44.533
We conclude by
lowering the lights...

49:44.653 --> 49:47.893
.. and then when you get up in the morning again comes
knock, knock...

49:48.014 --> 49:50.653
.. and then Venus reappears
disguised as Vanda.

49:50.773 --> 49:53.292
- To take revenge.
- But yes, it's great!

49:54.812 --> 49:56.891
 So are you?
- What?

49:58.692 --> 50:00.252
 Are you he?

50:00.372 --> 50:03.131
Kushemski - Novacek,
Novacek - Kushemski.

50:03.252 --> 50:07.091
- No, not me.  
You said that there is a lot of you in there.

50:07.212 --> 50:09.090
Then maybe you are Vanda?

50:09.131 --> 50:13.330
- The play has nothing to do with me.
- Sure, you're just the author.

50:13.411 --> 50:14.850
Oops, the adapter.

50:14.891 --> 50:17.530
Type: "If a critic says that
that's me, kill him."

50:17.610 --> 50:21.969
- I have the right to invent characters. 
- Of course adapter Novacek.

50:22.050 --> 50:26.048
Just by chance you came across in the characters in a novel
about sadomasochism.

50:26.130 --> 50:27.968
No, it's a famous book and I...

50:28.050 --> 50:31.688
Didn't you experience this "unpredictable moment"
at the age of twelve?

50:31.769 --> 50:33.928
- No.
- ln the library...

50:34.929 --> 50:37.648
- No!
- With a cat.

50:41.249 --> 50:42.927
No.

50:42.968 --> 50:47.486
She's still waiting for your "big moment"?

50:47.528 --> 50:49.526
It's not a damn bit like that!

50:49.567 --> 50:55.166
I find the relationship between the two characters
both fascinating and complex. Very rich.

50:55.207 --> 50:59.046
- Of course! 
- I love the emotional depth of the characters.

50:59.166 --> 51:02.285
Don't you see more of
this kind of thing nowadays.

51:02.366 --> 51:04.925
Don't you see more of this kind
rage nowadays.

51:05.005 --> 51:08.284
- I should submit it some friends of mine.
- Okay.

51:10.166 --> 51:13.644
Very well, then I don't understand
anything about anything.

51:15.004 --> 51:19.403
When you return home, your fiancee doesn't
tie you to the bed and whip you?

51:19.444 --> 51:21.083
No.

51:21.124 --> 51:24.363
You should ask her and see if your fiancee will do it.

51:24.484 --> 51:27.203
- Stop calling her "fiancee."
- Excuse me.

51:27.243 --> 51:30.002
Should I call her your better half?

51:30.084 --> 51:34.202
- I don't like that very much. 
- Would you tell me if you were afraid?

51:34.323 --> 51:36.202
This is not about us.

51:36.962 --> 51:39.721
Let me guess about your...

51:41.163 --> 51:42.801
Marie-Cécile.

51:42.842 --> 51:45.961
Marie-Cécile. I bet she's younger than you.

51:46.042 --> 51:48.600
Good deduction.

51:48.682 --> 51:53.360
Definitely grew up in a nice little house
a good family in Provence.

51:55.801 --> 51:59.360
- I bet from La Baule.
- Nantes, actually.

51:59.401 --> 52:03.839
But I bet her family
spent the weekend in La Baule...

52:03.960 --> 52:06.359
.. in a beautiful villa with a garden.

52:07.679 --> 52:11.879
She goes sailing and loves seafood.

52:11.999 --> 52:13.798
Yes, it's true.

52:13.919 --> 52:18.438
She is tall, slightly authoritarian,
but without being disagreeable.

52:18.479 --> 52:21.318
with wonderful hair...

52:21.359 --> 52:25.557
.. Long legs and a nice pair of...

52:26.037 --> 52:28.077
.. eyes.

52:28.198 --> 52:29.997
A mind to be respected.

52:30.118 --> 52:33.956
She went to preparatory school in Paris, of course
to Louis Le Grand.

52:34.037 --> 52:36.916
Am I wrong?

52:36.957 --> 52:40.156
 Henry IV, School of Economic Sciences
- And she has a doctorate?

52:40.196 --> 52:43.675
- She is finishing her thesis in sociology.
- She has a dog?

52:43.756 --> 52:46.795
Let's see... I would say a labrador.

52:48.835 --> 52:50.115
It's called...

52:50.156 --> 52:53.234
It has an unusual name that is a little 'intellectual.

52:53.275 --> 52:55.434
- Bourdieu?
- Derrida.

52:55.515 --> 52:57.954
You are not lacking in culture I see.

52:58.075 --> 52:59.994
I bet that she's a blonde...

53:00.115 --> 53:02.513
.. she likes a small seedy theater and has a Belgian cactus...

53:02.594 --> 53:04.513
.. Not exactly the Comédie Française.

53:04.555 --> 53:07.193
No, there is taste in her family.
Am I right?

53:08.153 --> 53:10.072
Of course, I'm right. Good.

53:10.193 --> 53:14.512
But she is an artist and you lost your head
over this Marie-Cécile...

53:14.593 --> 53:16.672
.. and her sensitivity.

53:16.753 --> 53:18.792
"You're perhaps the first man I have ever met...

53:18.832 --> 53:21.311
.. who has a real sensitivity."

53:21.352 --> 53:24.911
She loves books, the opera, the ballet
things like that.

53:24.952 --> 53:27.591
In the evening, watch and talk about the Arts
last Goncourt...

53:27.672 --> 53:30.591
.. and then fuck quietly.

53:30.671 --> 53:34.150
Nothing is better than a quiet sex session
to relax.

53:34.191 --> 53:37.390
But there's a voice that echoes in his head...

53:37.431 --> 53:40.190
.. a voice that demands other things.

53:40.270 --> 53:42.790
I do not know what it is but it echoes.

53:42.830 --> 53:44.989
Boom.

53:45.110 --> 53:47.229
Boom.

53:47.270 --> 53:49.509
Boom.

53:49.549 --> 53:52.028
In the meantime you are happy.

53:52.069 --> 53:55.149
You truly, truly love her...

53:55.189 --> 53:58.308
.. and spend a quiet life looking Arty...

53:58.389 --> 54:00.708
.. and talking about the latest Goncourt.

54:00.828 --> 54:04.787
You will have children who will live
just like you and then you will die.

54:07.308 --> 54:09.227
Shall we continue to read?

54:12.467 --> 54:14.506
Yes, let's continue.

54:15.427 --> 54:19.186
 The meeting in the birch forest? 
- Okay.

54:20.507 --> 54:23.145
Let's pretend that's the statue of Venus.

54:23.227 --> 54:25.505
Hail, Aphrodite.

54:25.546 --> 54:27.825
Hail, Aphrodite...

55:28.420 --> 55:31.259
re-read the text quickly?

55:31.299 --> 55:33.059
No, Séverin.

55:33.099 --> 55:35.138
No, no, this is not good.

55:35.219 --> 55:38.498
All these stories of bondage and domination...

55:38.579 --> 55:41.378
You have corrupted me with all this talk.

55:41.458 --> 55:45.457
I am convinced that she would feel pleasure to dominate a man.

55:45.539 --> 55:47.617
- No.
- Maybe even to torture.

55:47.739 --> 55:49.977
- No.
- Admit it.

55:50.018 --> 55:51.817
Not for me.

55:51.897 --> 55:54.816
- How can I make you see reason?
- To hell with reason!

55:54.897 --> 55:57.816
Séverin, do you really not understand?

55:57.937 --> 56:01.496
You will never be
safe in the hands of a woman...

56:01.537 --> 56:03.815
.. whoever she is.

56:03.936 --> 56:06.575
But this play is sexist.
I want to yell!

56:06.696 --> 56:09.295
What is so sexist?

56:09.336 --> 56:11.614
"You will never be safe
in the hands of a woman."

56:11.696 --> 56:13.534
- But it's in the book...
- you can't change anything?

56:13.656 --> 56:16.414
- The book is sexist.
- The book is not sexist.

56:16.536 --> 56:20.734
- On the contrary, it is something...
- A classic of world literature.

56:20.855 --> 56:23.334
- That's what you were about to say?
- Not exactly.

56:23.375 --> 56:25.174
And this?

56:25.295 --> 56:27.533
We do not have a certain Titian here, sweetheart.

56:27.574 --> 56:30.173
- It's a nice BDSM porno.
- What the...?

56:30.214 --> 56:33.692
This story is nothing more than a big cliche. 
- And why is it a chiche?

56:33.774 --> 56:36.693
He is spanked and suddenly
he likes to be whipped?

56:36.773 --> 56:39.572
- It's what happened to the author.
- And it happened to you? 
- No!

56:39.693 --> 56:41.612
Then what?

56:41.693 --> 56:44.971
For me it is a play about two people who are
united eternally.

56:45.092 --> 56:46.532
their hearts are handcuffed to each other.

56:46.652 --> 56:49.891
- Shackled in perversion.
- No, handcuffed in passion.

56:49.972 --> 56:51.811
- Yes, but it's his passion!
- They have a chemistry...

56:51.892 --> 56:53.730
.. it's the meeting of two people
lighting fire to the powder.

56:53.851 --> 56:55.611
This is the struggle of the sexes, and classes.

56:55.651 --> 56:59.331
Vanda is an innocent woman who runs into a pervert.

56:59.371 --> 57:02.450
- But then you do not understand anything!
- Vanda says: "He has corrupted me!"

57:02.490 --> 57:05.809
And what if if her thirst for domination
was asleep inside her?

57:05.850 --> 57:07.769
Kushemski? If he was to awaken it?

57:07.850 --> 57:10.169
And if she was simply a woman?

57:10.290 --> 57:12.769
This text brochure looks like it was written by
an old Austrian misogynist.

57:12.810 --> 57:15.209
He forces her to a game of power
and then blames her.

57:15.289 --> 57:16.768
- That's not it.
- That's exactly it!

57:16.850 --> 57:19.528
- How?
- Look at the end for example. 
- Yes?

57:19.649 --> 57:21.288
Vanda tells the Greek to whip him...

57:21.329 --> 57:23.008
Kushemski .. then leaves him there with his cock in hand...

57:23.089 --> 57:25.527
.. and it would be her fault even though he was the one to want it?

57:25.609 --> 57:29.488
No, I think that little Kushemski
has the hots for the Greek.

57:29.608 --> 57:32.727
I wonder how you can be so bitchy at this point.

57:32.807 --> 57:34.767
How can you interpret Vanda so well...

57:34.887 --> 57:38.247
.. and then be bitchy at this point?

57:39.327 --> 57:41.486
Stupid cocksucking actress!

57:41.607 --> 57:43.846
What a cunt!

57:48.687 --> 57:50.245
Shit!

58:04.725 --> 58:06.683
- I'm sorry.
- Excuse me?

58:07.485 --> 58:09.563
 I'm sorry, I screwed up.

58:10.644 --> 58:13.003
Yes, but what is said is said.

58:13.044 --> 58:16.523
Let's say that the meaning of the play is
"beware of your desires."

58:16.644 --> 58:18.882
Since you knock on this door...

58:18.923 --> 58:22.522
here is the argument of the play...
.. you do not take the piss out of a goddess:

58:22.603 --> 58:24.442
.. so to speak.

58:24.563 --> 58:26.001
 So to speak.

58:27.562 --> 58:30.321
What is the modern way of saying "so to speak"?

58:31.882 --> 58:33.521
"asshole".

58:33.562 --> 58:35.361
If you say so.

58:37.001 --> 58:41.120
Luckily goddesses do not exist
otherwise we would be in deep shit.

58:43.881 --> 58:46.039
Okay, you're right.

58:46.160 --> 58:47.959
I accept everything you said.

58:48.920 --> 58:51.999
Can we... can we continue?

58:59.959 --> 59:01.878
Please Vanda.

59:19.357 --> 59:23.916
You do not understand that you
will never be safe in the hands of a woman?

59:23.957 --> 59:25.395
Whoever she is.

59:25.477 --> 59:28.395
We are two adventurers, Vanda.

59:28.477 --> 59:31.355
Let's explore the limits of human nature.

59:31.397 --> 59:33.075
You're sick.

59:33.156 --> 59:36.914
You have been poisoned by the countess and 
now suffer the effects.

59:37.035 --> 59:40.354
- But she adores effects like me.
- No. ..

59:40.395 --> 59:43.594
You like having complete power over me. 
- No.

59:43.635 --> 59:46.274
Your desires are my orders.

59:46.394 --> 59:49.273
I beg and crawl at your feet.

59:49.394 --> 59:51.193
Do with me whatever you want.

59:51.314 --> 59:54.433
You are a mad visionary, a fanatic.

59:54.514 --> 59:56.913
Who is willing to do anything,
to realize his dream.

59:56.953 --> 01:00:01.032
- But my dream is you.
- Get away from me, Séverin.

01:00:01.113 --> 01:00:03.392
Before it is too late.

01:00:05.313 --> 01:00:07.872
- Do you love me?
- I do not know.

01:00:07.953 --> 01:00:11.591
Decide, do something
to be convinced.

01:00:12.752 --> 01:00:17.591
- How? - 
Do what all lovers do.

01:00:17.712 --> 01:00:20.430
- Let me suffer.
- This disgusts me.

01:00:20.472 --> 01:00:22.951
And I hate to pretend.

01:00:22.991 --> 01:00:25.750
I'm not the countess, your aunt.
I am myself.

01:00:25.831 --> 01:00:27.550
Repeat the line, the challenge.

01:00:27.631 --> 01:00:30.869
I'm not the countess, your aunt.
I am myself.

01:00:30.911 --> 01:00:33.669
- Again, get angry!
- What do you want from me, Thomas?

01:00:33.790 --> 01:00:36.429
I'm not your fucking aunt,
I am me! What do you want?

01:00:36.549 --> 01:00:39.509
- I don't know!!
- This time it is no longer the play.

01:00:39.550 --> 01:00:41.828
- I want a lot more.
- But you're not her.

01:00:41.949 --> 01:00:44.348
I'm just a poor bitch who needs the work.

01:00:44.429 --> 01:00:47.788
And I'm not your aunt, I am me.
Okay so?

01:00:49.149 --> 01:00:51.147
Yeah, okay. Very well.

01:00:52.508 --> 01:00:55.347
I can't do this part.
It's too hard.

01:00:55.388 --> 01:00:57.666
Don't go, please. Vanda. Stay here.

01:01:01.348 --> 01:01:03.026
Say "I beg you."

01:01:04.267 --> 01:01:06.386
I beg you.

01:01:06.427 --> 01:01:10.745
- You're bad.
- I'm completely in your power.

01:01:11.586 --> 01:01:16.025
Liar, you are not in my power, 
I am in your hands.

01:01:16.106 --> 01:01:19.985
You're supposed to be my slave
but it is you who dominates me.

01:01:20.106 --> 01:01:21.664
- It's true isn't it?
- What?

01:01:21.745 --> 01:01:25.344
You never stop saying that I have the power
but you've got it.

01:01:25.385 --> 01:01:27.864
The more he submits the more he dominates.

01:01:27.905 --> 01:01:29.584
It's complex, yes.

01:01:37.504 --> 01:01:40.222
Here is the contract that we talked about.

01:01:40.264 --> 01:01:44.543
It establishes that you agree to a test
of total submission.

01:01:44.583 --> 01:01:46.382
You will be my slave.

01:01:46.463 --> 01:01:49.501
Completely give up your own identity.

01:01:49.623 --> 01:01:53.421
Your body, your soul,
your honor will all belong to me.

01:01:53.463 --> 01:01:55.141
Forever.

01:01:57.142 --> 01:01:58.941
Sign at the bottom.

01:02:01.382 --> 01:02:03.181
Well?

01:02:03.261 --> 01:02:06.300
I thought my commitment would be for a year.

01:02:06.421 --> 01:02:09.420
- What? You are trying to dictate conditions to me?
- Can I re-read the contract?

01:02:09.501 --> 01:02:11.820
Why? Maybe you don't trust me?

01:02:11.941 --> 01:02:13.819
Sign.

01:02:26.419 --> 01:02:27.858
Good.

01:02:31.498 --> 01:02:33.618
From now on you will call me Madame...

01:02:33.658 --> 01:02:36.617
.. and you will speak only when allow it.

01:02:43.378 --> 01:02:47.656
You will serve me meals
and await my orders in the hallway.

01:02:49.497 --> 01:02:52.576
In the morning you will dress me
and you will dress me in the evening.

01:02:52.616 --> 01:02:55.615
Bring me my socks
and put on my shoes.

01:02:55.696 --> 01:02:58.095
- I'll call you Thomas.
- But I'm Gregoir in the text.

01:02:58.136 --> 01:03:01.374
I changed it. Henceforth, I will call you Thomas.

01:03:02.455 --> 01:03:05.055
You will serve as my valet and bring my coat with my coat of arms.

01:03:05.095 --> 01:03:09.254
And as a gentleman... 
- You have to keep your word.

01:03:09.295 --> 01:03:12.294
Don't we have a signed a contract which states that you are my slave?

01:03:12.374 --> 01:03:15.533
- But I'm not your slave, I'm your valet.
- The difference escapes me.

01:03:15.654 --> 01:03:19.373
- Is it a game?
- This is what I am.

01:03:19.494 --> 01:03:21.613
I'm Stubborn, strong-willed, greedy...

01:03:21.653 --> 01:03:24.132
.. and when I start something,
I see it through to the end.

01:03:24.173 --> 01:03:26.812
The more you resist, the more I persist.

01:03:26.893 --> 01:03:29.812
But, deep down, your nature is noble.

01:03:29.892 --> 01:03:33.371
What do you know about my nature
aside from what you think you know?

01:03:33.413 --> 01:03:36.491
Please forgive me, I was despicable.

01:03:36.532 --> 01:03:39.411
Give me your passport and your money.

01:03:42.852 --> 01:03:44.690
- But ..
- give it to me!

01:03:51.051 --> 01:03:52.969
Tomorrow we leave for Florence.

01:03:54.411 --> 01:03:57.729
I will travel in first class, you in third.

01:03:57.770 --> 01:04:01.489
- In third class?
- You will eat and sleep with the servants.

01:04:03.410 --> 01:04:07.208
- What is it, Thomas? You have something to say?
- Where will this end?

01:04:07.249 --> 01:04:10.128
End?
We havn't even started.

01:04:10.249 --> 01:04:12.248
But Vanda, I...

01:04:12.288 --> 01:04:14.327
She slaps him...

01:04:15.968 --> 01:04:17.887
.. kisses him...

01:04:20.808 --> 01:04:22.487
.. and caresses his cheek...

01:04:23.448 --> 01:04:25.807
Did I hurt you, my dear?

01:04:25.847 --> 01:04:28.126
Yes, you are deliciously evil.

01:04:28.247 --> 01:04:29.805
Well.

01:04:34.967 --> 01:04:37.606
What did you learn about the handsome Greek?

01:04:37.686 --> 01:04:40.245
His name is Alexis, he is a count.

01:04:41.166 --> 01:04:43.844
- He's beautiful, isn't he?
- Ah, he's fascinating.

01:04:43.965 --> 01:04:46.484
Kushemski, you said you had a crush on the Greek.

01:04:52.245 --> 01:04:56.524
I have to take a room next to his tonight.

01:04:57.765 --> 01:05:00.522
I will allow Count Alexis to seduce me.

01:05:00.644 --> 01:05:03.763
Ah, but Vanda...

01:05:05.044 --> 01:05:08.522
What is it?
Am I not free to do what I please?

01:05:09.643 --> 01:05:12.041
- You turns me on.
- Silence, dog!

01:05:12.163 --> 01:05:15.121
Bring me a rod of birch wood.

01:05:27.041 --> 01:05:29.200
He takes the branch to her...

01:05:33.281 --> 01:05:35.079
Listen to this hiss?

01:05:35.201 --> 01:05:38.080
This sound vibrates my nerves
like a tuning fork.

01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:40.959
I have only one desire:
to hear you groan under the blows.

01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:43.198
Feel Herr Doktor Kushemski what I crave...

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:46.679
.. crying like a little girl,
my heart leaps in my chest.

01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:48.518
The air is hot.

01:05:48.599 --> 01:05:51.998
What have you done? What have you done?
Bla bla bla bla bla bla!

01:05:52.119 --> 01:05:54.238
How bla bla bla?
- No. What do you mean?

01:05:54.278 --> 01:05:56.878
Vanda turns into evil witch.

01:05:56.918 --> 01:06:00.037
Air glowing,
my nerves are a tuning fork...

01:06:00.158 --> 01:06:03.357
Let's have lightning and drum rolls while we're at.

01:06:05.638 --> 01:06:07.837
Tomas, I really, really love it so much.

01:06:07.917 --> 01:06:11.436
I like it too, 
but this has already been seen and reviewed.

01:06:11.517 --> 01:06:14.556
What do you mean?

01:06:14.637 --> 01:06:17.556
The play is... my play!

01:06:17.636 --> 01:06:21.515
It's a superb play
and no one will make me change my mind.

01:06:21.636 --> 01:06:23.435
Damn!

01:06:24.836 --> 01:06:26.794
You don't know anything...

01:06:32.995 --> 01:06:36.594
I do not believe, I refuse
to demolish my work...

01:06:36.635 --> 01:06:39.234
.. Whether you are in the play or not!
Go to hell.

01:06:39.274 --> 01:06:41.073
Okay, it's you who decides.

01:06:42.994 --> 01:06:46.432
She takes a knife and puts it to his throat.

01:06:50.753 --> 01:06:52.712
God, how I hate you.

01:06:52.793 --> 01:06:55.591
What are you doing? What's going on?

01:06:56.872 --> 01:06:58.712
Do you think I don't understand your game?

01:06:58.792 --> 01:07:01.431
Do you think you can use me, I could subdue...

01:07:01.472 --> 01:07:03.511
I do not want anything of the kind,
I swear.

01:07:03.592 --> 01:07:07.830
If you only knew how delicious this sensation is.

01:07:09.151 --> 01:07:10.710
You know what?

01:07:10.792 --> 01:07:12.470
I'll go to the Labour Court...

01:07:15.271 --> 01:07:18.229
- I'd like to give you the part.
- Now you say this.

01:07:18.270 --> 01:07:21.509
Will you put it in writing?
CELLPHONE RINGS

01:07:21.630 --> 01:07:23.548
Wait, I'm sorry.

01:07:23.670 --> 01:07:26.308
- Yes?
- Fuck you, Marie-Cécile!

01:07:26.429 --> 01:07:28.228
No, I'm still here.

01:07:28.349 --> 01:07:32.028
- I have things to finish.
- He's fucking me Marie-Cécile! 

01:07:32.069 --> 01:07:34.947
He's buggering me on all fours on the stage. 
- Soon.

01:07:35.029 --> 01:07:37.827
He fucks like a Labrador in heat!

01:07:38.788 --> 01:07:42.387
Yes, soon.
You start eating without me, then I'll come. OK?

01:07:44.068 --> 01:07:48.266
But it's leftovers?
Leg of lamb from yesterday?

01:07:49.947 --> 01:07:53.986
I'll call you when I leave and then...
Later, yes.

01:08:11.905 --> 01:08:13.824
Yeah, okay.

01:08:14.984 --> 01:08:16.903
I don't know.

01:08:16.944 --> 01:08:19.943
I'll be back when I get back, okay?

01:08:20.024 --> 01:08:22.783
Fuck you. Ciao.

01:08:24.384 --> 01:08:27.943
- Excuse me. -
There was no one on the line, right?

01:08:27.984 --> 01:08:30.221
 What?
- You pretended.

01:08:30.263 --> 01:08:34.182
- You pretended to talk to someone.
- I was talking with my sweetheart.

01:08:34.223 --> 01:08:37.942
- Who is this guy?
- Who says it's a guy?

01:08:40.942 --> 01:08:42.981
And why did you pretend?

01:08:43.102 --> 01:08:44.981
 According to you?

01:08:45.022 --> 01:08:48.381
I didn't like that I had to answer the phone.

01:08:48.461 --> 01:08:51.500
Type  "female revenge"?
Or something like that?

01:08:51.582 --> 01:08:53.859
 Something like this, yes.

01:08:55.180 --> 01:08:58.100
Any other director I would have already jumped on him.

01:08:58.180 --> 01:09:01.939
- I am not "any other director."
- Bullshit.

01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:04.939
If you thought you could, you would have already done it.

01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:06.859
Not true.

01:09:06.939 --> 01:09:09.738
 Though I him I allowed?

01:09:12.618 --> 01:09:15.978
How did you know all those things about Marie-Cecile?

01:09:16.059 --> 01:09:19.057
 I met her at the gym.
- You saw her!

01:09:19.939 --> 01:09:23.897
She seemed very nice and very beautiful. Really.

01:09:25.578 --> 01:09:28.577
We were talking while we were changing in the locker room...

01:09:28.657 --> 01:09:31.576
.. Series "talks between girls."

01:09:31.697 --> 01:09:33.256
I told her I'm an actress...

01:09:33.337 --> 01:09:37.055
.. But I also am a private detective, 
on the side.

01:09:37.096 --> 01:09:39.734
And she told me about her boyfriend.

01:09:39.817 --> 01:09:42.255
A very mysterious type, a writer.

01:09:43.176 --> 01:09:46.295
She gave me a bit 'of money
to investigate you...

01:09:46.336 --> 01:09:50.495
.. to find out who you are, if you
seriously love her, things like that.

01:09:51.095 --> 01:09:53.854
I do prenuptial agreements...

01:09:55.335 --> 01:09:59.414
I do research on criminal record and financial status.

01:10:07.214 --> 01:10:10.533
I have to meet her later at a hotel...

01:10:10.573 --> 01:10:13.052
.. and give her a full account.

01:10:14.173 --> 01:10:16.532
She has a nice body, huh? Congratulations

01:10:17.773 --> 01:10:19.812
You're amazing!

01:10:20.533 --> 01:10:24.611
- When a man tells me that I sniff a trap. 
- Ah, touché.

01:10:28.811 --> 01:10:33.331
- Marie-Cécile never showers at the gym.  
 - Ah, no?

01:10:33.371 --> 01:10:35.490
Yet she was wet.

01:10:36.851 --> 01:10:38.409
Let's finish?

01:10:39.491 --> 01:10:41.289
Yes

01:10:41.371 --> 01:10:43.209
 Put this on.

01:11:11.528 --> 01:11:14.526
 Thomas, you made me wait.
- I'm sorry, ma'am.

01:11:14.608 --> 01:11:16.527
I cleaned the silverware.

01:11:16.567 --> 01:11:19.406
You really look stylish wearing your uniform.

01:11:19.446 --> 01:11:22.045
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Turn around.

01:11:24.327 --> 01:11:27.325
Oh yes. Definitely irresistible.

01:11:28.566 --> 01:11:31.445
I might even forget that you are a valet.

01:11:32.765 --> 01:11:36.244
- But something is missing.
- Where's this coming from? It's not on...

01:11:36.325 --> 01:11:38.644
I'm improvising.

01:11:38.764 --> 01:11:41.044
 Something's missing.

01:11:54.603 --> 01:11:56.762
Yes, really chic!

01:11:56.883 --> 01:11:58.642
The icing on the cake.

01:11:58.683 --> 01:12:02.282
- You like it?
- It is very nice my lady.

01:12:02.403 --> 01:12:06.601
I could almost fall in love with you when I see you with this collar.

01:12:06.722 --> 01:12:10.521
"Almost fall in love"?
This means that you don't love me!

01:12:10.561 --> 01:12:13.801
I get bored, I whine constantly.

01:12:13.921 --> 01:12:15.920
Your Count? Is he?

01:12:15.961 --> 01:12:17.400
You're in love with him?

01:12:17.521 --> 01:12:19.400
He followed me to Florence!

01:12:19.441 --> 01:12:22.519
He does not love you. He just wants you,
as he wanted a thousand others.

01:12:22.561 --> 01:12:25.279
Insolent animal!
How dare you speak to me in that tone?

01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:28.279
- Bring me my boots.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:33.598
Not there. In the bag... idiot.

01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:35.639
Yes, ma'am.

01:12:35.719 --> 01:12:39.078
From now on you will call me Mistress.
It is more degrading.

01:12:39.119 --> 01:12:40.798
Yes, Mistress.

01:12:54.678 --> 01:12:56.956
 Do you like my boots?

01:12:58.757 --> 01:13:00.596
Yes, Mistress.

01:13:00.717 --> 01:13:02.835
 Do you like them?

01:13:03.477 --> 01:13:05.516
Yes, Mistress.

01:13:05.596 --> 01:13:07.515
And my legs.

01:13:08.396 --> 01:13:10.035
Yes, Mistress.

01:14:46.906 --> 01:14:50.825
Tomorrow maybe I will tie you
to the fig tree that stands in the garden...

01:14:50.866 --> 01:14:53.825
.. and sting you with my golden clasp.

01:14:56.145 --> 01:15:00.185
Or I could attach you
naked to a plow...

01:15:00.225 --> 01:15:02.584
.. and lash you.

01:15:06.824 --> 01:15:09.224
Would you like this?

01:15:09.344 --> 01:15:11.023
Yes, Mistress.

01:15:11.983 --> 01:15:14.823
I am very pleased with you, Thomas.

01:15:14.863 --> 01:15:17.703
I might even give you a piece of candy.

01:15:18.783 --> 01:15:20.742
Will there be anything else?

01:15:20.863 --> 01:15:22.902
Yes, one last thing.

01:15:23.023 --> 01:15:26.381
Call your Marie-Cécile
tonight and tell her you are not coming home.

01:15:27.422 --> 01:15:29.621
- I can't do that.
- Ah, no?

01:15:31.022 --> 01:15:33.181
You can't?

01:15:33.222 --> 01:15:35.341
No, I can't.

01:15:49.660 --> 01:15:51.579
Don't lie to her.

01:15:57.099 --> 01:16:00.218
 (Marie-Cécile) Hello?
- Yes, Marie-Cecile? It's me.

01:16:00.299 --> 01:16:01.978
Tonight I cannot come home.

01:16:02.019 --> 01:16:05.098
- Tonight I cannot come home.
- Do not explain why.

01:16:05.139 --> 01:16:07.618
- No, I can not tell you why.
- Tell her goodbye.

01:16:07.658 --> 01:16:09.577
Goodbye.

01:16:09.658 --> 01:16:12.097
Hang up and turn off your cell phone.

01:16:18.217 --> 01:16:20.257
Don't you feel great?

01:16:20.337 --> 01:16:23.376
Colluding here the two of us together...

01:16:24.457 --> 01:16:26.615
This place is so nice.

01:16:26.736 --> 01:16:28.736
And also so quiet.

01:16:28.776 --> 01:16:32.975
I do not know even where I am. 
- But think about it.

01:16:33.696 --> 01:16:36.575
A new life ahead of you, of us.

01:16:36.656 --> 01:16:38.615
There's just us.

01:16:41.215 --> 01:16:43.414
We and your friend, the Count.

01:16:44.255 --> 01:16:47.254
Stop bothering me by speaking about him.

01:16:47.375 --> 01:16:50.014
Haven't I punished you enough?
here's the problem.

01:16:50.135 --> 01:16:54.533
Just when I wanted to take you in my arms.

01:16:54.574 --> 01:16:57.413
you were going to... really?

01:16:57.453 --> 01:16:59.012
Come on.

01:16:59.093 --> 01:17:00.693
Come here.

01:17:08.972 --> 01:17:10.971
Take me in your arms.

01:17:14.492 --> 01:17:16.250
You see?

01:17:16.292 --> 01:17:21.691
For an hour I'll let you imagine you are free.

01:17:22.851 --> 01:17:26.210
In the end you will understand that you are
what I want.

01:17:26.250 --> 01:17:28.130
An animal.

01:17:28.170 --> 01:17:30.050
An object.

01:17:30.090 --> 01:17:32.489
An empty space to fill.

01:17:34.170 --> 01:17:36.569
No, I will not allow it.

01:17:37.649 --> 01:17:40.648
- I will not, I refuse.
- I beg your pardon?

01:17:41.489 --> 01:17:43.888
- I wrote you a letter.
- A letter?

01:17:45.049 --> 01:17:47.367
A "Dear John" letter, perhaps.

01:17:47.449 --> 01:17:51.927
"The degradation is too much,
you have already become unbearable."

01:17:52.009 --> 01:17:54.687
The degradation claiming you...

01:17:54.768 --> 01:17:57.086
I can not recite this passage.

01:17:57.168 --> 01:17:59.247
- I do not see that happening.
- How would it be?

01:17:59.368 --> 01:18:01.167
Yet it is clear enough.

01:18:01.287 --> 01:18:04.406
What should I do?
In your head as you see the scene?

01:18:04.487 --> 01:18:06.806
But it is the time when...
What was the line?

01:18:06.887 --> 01:18:09.806
- "I wrote you a letter."
- A letter...

01:18:11.246 --> 01:18:13.485
A "Dear John" letter, perhaps?

01:18:13.526 --> 01:18:17.124
- The degradation claiming you...
- Lay down a bit '.

01:18:19.246 --> 01:18:23.484
The degradation claiming you,
you've already become unbearable?

01:18:23.605 --> 01:18:26.364
You have to listen to her for days...

01:18:27.085 --> 01:18:29.684
.. you have been afraid to show it.

01:18:29.724 --> 01:18:31.963
So? Where is it?

01:18:32.004 --> 01:18:34.123
Show me this masterpiece.

01:18:36.284 --> 01:18:39.202
A little 'fun
would not make me sick.

01:18:39.284 --> 01:18:42.082
That's great, Tom.
Are you strong.

01:18:42.763 --> 01:18:44.442
You should do you Vanda.

01:18:44.483 --> 01:18:46.122
No, no...

01:18:46.163 --> 01:18:48.162
But yes!

01:18:48.203 --> 01:18:50.562
You have to be Vanda.

01:18:51.562 --> 01:18:55.521
You understand her character better than me, you created her...

01:18:55.602 --> 01:18:57.440
.. you know her intimately.

01:18:57.561 --> 01:19:00.681
- I do not know her lines.
- But of course you know them.

01:19:04.761 --> 01:19:07.840
- Pay attention, Séverin.
- I do the best I can, Mistress.

01:19:07.881 --> 01:19:10.639
But as usual your best is not up to par.

01:19:24.279 --> 01:19:27.278
- Bring me my coat.
- Yes, Mistress.

01:19:29.678 --> 01:19:32.557
Prepare a bottle of champagne and two cocktails.

01:19:32.598 --> 01:19:35.118
The Count Alexis will arrive
at any moment.

01:19:35.238 --> 01:19:37.357
- But mistress...
- If you don't like it, you can leave.

01:19:37.877 --> 01:19:39.997
Far from my sight.

01:19:40.038 --> 01:19:42.196
Your fur, Mistress.

01:19:48.316 --> 01:19:51.195
You will marry the Count Alexis, Mistress?

01:19:51.277 --> 01:19:55.235
I will not lie anymore, Séverin.
That man makes me shudder.

01:19:55.276 --> 01:19:57.435
Great!

01:19:57.516 --> 01:19:59.355
Wait!

01:20:00.076 --> 01:20:01.955
Sit down.

01:20:06.795 --> 01:20:11.594
It lives in my thoughts,
I can not drive it away.

01:21:01.030 --> 01:21:04.268
It lives in my thoughts,
I can not drive it away.

01:21:06.669 --> 01:21:09.067
- I'm suffering.
- You're magnificent.

01:21:09.149 --> 01:21:12.188
- Still you love this suffering.
- Get up and come back a little later.

01:21:27.667 --> 01:21:31.826
If you ask me to become your wife, I will say yes.

01:21:31.866 --> 01:21:33.546
You are magical.

01:21:37.226 --> 01:21:39.745
You know it's very jealous of you?

01:21:41.585 --> 01:21:44.584
I told him everything about the two of us.

01:21:44.665 --> 01:21:47.185
He probably has threatened to kill you.

01:21:48.305 --> 01:21:49.744
In fact...

01:21:49.865 --> 01:21:51.904
- The Count hit you?
 Yes

01:21:52.024 --> 01:21:55.503
- You liked it?
 Yes, it was sublime.

01:21:55.624 --> 01:21:57.063
More intense.

01:22:00.424 --> 01:22:04.622
- Yes, and it was sublime.
- Even more intense.

01:22:04.743 --> 01:22:06.903
- He slapped you in the face?
- Yes

01:22:07.023 --> 01:22:08.582
 And it was sublime.

01:22:08.703 --> 01:22:11.422
- Oh!
- I'll kill you, both of you.

01:22:11.462 --> 01:22:13.862
I tear out your heart,
throw it to the dogs!

01:22:15.062 --> 01:22:16.981
You are cursed!

01:22:17.063 --> 01:22:20.581
- What curse?
 Yes, kill me Séverin!

01:22:20.702 --> 01:22:23.420
I'm sick of this comedy.

01:22:23.462 --> 01:22:25.500
What comedy?

01:22:26.341 --> 01:22:30.500
But how can you love me?
I was terrible with you.

01:22:30.541 --> 01:22:33.260
I have done everything to save you...

01:22:33.300 --> 01:22:36.499
.. to heal,
to show you how much I love you.

01:22:38.460 --> 01:22:40.019
All to no avail?

01:22:40.140 --> 01:22:42.058
None.

01:22:42.140 --> 01:22:46.259
It was just a game?
A play? And the contract?

01:22:46.379 --> 01:22:48.658
Oh, the contract...

01:22:50.099 --> 01:22:54.178
My little, sweet, silly...

01:22:57.538 --> 01:23:01.257
Séverin,
I loved you from the first moment.

01:23:02.217 --> 01:23:05.337
I could not tell you why. I am not who you think.

01:23:05.417 --> 01:23:08.696
I am weak, and lost... 
don't you understand?

01:23:08.778 --> 01:23:10.496
Not bad.

01:23:10.617 --> 01:23:13.016
It is I who should be submissive.

01:23:13.137 --> 01:23:16.136
I who should be whipped and tied up.

01:23:16.216 --> 01:23:19.615
 I think I will tie you to the statue
with a pair of your socks.

01:23:19.736 --> 01:23:22.855
 That's What you want, right?
- Yes, I beg you.

01:23:27.295 --> 01:23:29.574
Do with me what you wish.

01:23:31.335 --> 01:23:35.693
- Promise to never leave me.
- I'll never leave you, I swear.

01:23:46.253 --> 01:23:47.812
Turn around.

01:24:03.492 --> 01:24:05.211
The hands?

01:24:08.931 --> 01:24:12.490
I've dreamed of this moment ever since I met you.

01:24:12.531 --> 01:24:14.930
Louder, louder.

01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:16.930
I humble myself.

01:24:16.970 --> 01:24:20.049
Mortify, subdue me, I implore you.

01:24:21.250 --> 01:24:23.169
Very well, Tom.

01:24:23.210 --> 01:24:25.369
This should be really good.

01:24:25.449 --> 01:24:28.608
This is great.
But you know what is the problem?

01:24:28.729 --> 01:24:32.567
Whatever we say or do,
this piece is degrading.

01:24:32.649 --> 01:24:35.207
It is an insult to women.
Your pornography.

01:24:35.289 --> 01:24:39.367
- But what are you saying?
- A damsel in distress...

01:24:39.409 --> 01:24:41.927
.. a poor defenseless
bitch who humbles herself before a man:

01:24:42.048 --> 01:24:44.167
"Beat me, hurt me,
I'm just a woman."

01:24:44.208 --> 01:24:46.127
Holy cow!

01:24:47.447 --> 01:24:50.286
- Damn!
- Are these emotions too strong?

01:24:50.767 --> 01:24:52.246
That's good.

01:24:52.367 --> 01:24:54.406
"I don't see this kind of anger these days."

01:24:54.526 --> 01:24:55.966
But Vanda...

01:24:57.047 --> 01:24:59.085
Thank me.

01:24:59.646 --> 01:25:01.125
Thank you.

01:25:01.846 --> 01:25:03.405
Thanks to whom?

01:25:03.486 --> 01:25:05.325
Thank you, Mistress.

01:25:06.286 --> 01:25:08.924
You thought you could dupe the stupid starlet, huh?

01:25:09.045 --> 01:25:11.684
- To use her to satisfy your sick inclinations?
- No.

01:25:11.805 --> 01:25:14.564
Like Frankenstein build yourself a little female of your own?

01:25:14.684 --> 01:25:17.524
- You believed you could use me to humiliate you? 
- No, Vanda.

01:25:17.564 --> 01:25:19.564
I swear!

01:25:19.604 --> 01:25:23.083
- Thank you, Mistress.
- Thank you, goddess.

01:25:23.804 --> 01:25:26.283
Thank you... goddess.

01:25:48.161 --> 01:25:49.960

01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:04.679
Shit! Fuck!

01:26:28.838 --> 01:26:33.036
Oh Bacchae, Cadmus,
we dance to the rhythm of Bacchus.

01:26:33.117 --> 01:26:35.396

and put him in the hands of a woman"
