<b>- [RuPaul] Previously</b>
<b>on All Stars...</b>

00:02.035 --> 00:04.505
<b>Each week the winner</b>
<b>will eliminate</b>

00:04.538 --> 00:07.908
<b>one of her fellow queens.</b>

00:07.941 --> 00:11.912
<b>- How do you feel about</b>
<b>the whole elimination set up?</b>

00:11.945 --> 00:13.113
<b>- I'm just gonna send</b>
<b>the bitch home</b>

00:13.146 --> 00:15.516
<b>that I think is the strongest.</b>

00:15.549 --> 00:19.419
<b>- [RuPaul] Welcome to "RuPaul's</b>
<b>All Star Variety Show".</b>

00:19.453 --> 00:22.155
<b>Aja.</b>
<b>- You really brought it.</b>

00:22.189 --> 00:24.825
<b>That jump, it was just insane.</b>

00:24.858 --> 00:25.826
<b>- [RuPaul]</b>
<b>BenDeLaCreme.</b>

00:25.859 --> 00:27.494
<b>- You look stunning,</b>
<b>head to toe,</b>

00:27.528 --> 00:29.563
<b>and then you give us comedy.</b>

00:29.596 --> 00:31.498
<b>- [RuPaul]</b>
<b>Morgan McMichaels.</b>

00:31.532 --> 00:33.333
<b>- Any self doubt,</b>
<b>knock it off.</b>

00:33.367 --> 00:35.903
<b>Because anything less than</b>
<b>a hundred is not good enough.</b>

00:35.936 --> 00:37.437
<b>- [RuPaul]</b>
<b>Chi Chi DeVayne.</b>

00:37.471 --> 00:39.673
<b>- All I kept doing was</b>
<b>looking at the shoe.</b>

00:39.706 --> 00:41.041
<b>It was almost like down here,</b>

00:41.074 --> 00:43.744
<b>when the rest of the girls</b>
<b>were taking it up there.</b>

00:43.777 --> 00:46.513
<b>- BenDeLaCreme,</b>
<b>you're a winner, baby.</b>

00:46.547 --> 00:49.917
<b>- Thank you.</b>

00:49.950 --> 00:53.654
<b>- Which queen have you</b>
<b>chosen to get the chop?</b>

00:53.687 --> 00:57.357
<b>- When we, as a group,</b>
<b>talked about why we might</b>

00:57.391 --> 00:58.992
<b>eliminate somebody</b>
<b>moving forward,</b>

00:59.026 --> 01:02.829
<b>we talked about that we would</b>
<b>not want to make that decision,</b>

01:02.863 --> 01:06.066
<b>pretty much unanimously,</b>
<b>based on knocking somebody</b>

01:06.066 --> 01:07.801
<b>that we saw as fierce</b>
<b>competition out of the way.</b>

01:07.835 --> 01:09.837
<b>And that is something</b>
<b>that you would do,</b>

01:09.870 --> 01:12.139
<b>so I chose Morgan McMichaels.</b>

01:13.674 --> 01:17.711
<b>- I think DeLa believes that</b>
<b>we're set on a group consensus.</b>

01:17.744 --> 01:19.913
<b>Baby, that's a completely</b>
<b>different TV show.</b>

01:19.947 --> 01:23.083
<b>- Morgan McMichaels,</b>
<b>sashay away.</b>

01:31.858 --> 01:34.394
<b>- Oh, my goodness.</b>
<b>- Bitch.</b>

01:34.427 --> 01:36.462
<b>- Somebody really fierce,</b>
<b>Morgan McMichaels,</b>

01:36.496 --> 01:38.031
<b>has sashayed away.</b>

01:38.064 --> 01:40.566
<b>Next week it could be me.</b>
<b>It could be Shangela.</b>

01:40.600 --> 01:43.102
<b>It's probably Chi Chi.</b>

01:43.136 --> 01:46.439
<b>- "Keep rocking and</b>
<b>slay fabulous."</b>

01:46.472 --> 01:47.507
<b>- Ben, how [bleep]</b>
<b>do you feel?</b>

01:47.540 --> 01:48.841
<b>- Really [bleep].</b>

01:48.875 --> 01:51.144
<b>It's just like these</b>
<b>are impossible decisions.</b>

01:51.177 --> 01:54.580
<b>The reality of what this</b>
<b>competition is gonna feel like</b>

01:54.614 --> 01:56.149
<b>is really sinking in.</b>

01:56.182 --> 01:59.018
<b>I don't want it to be up</b>
<b>to me who goes home.</b>

02:00.453 --> 02:02.055
<b>This sucks.</b>

02:03.423 --> 02:06.326
<b>- Ugh. Wake up, bitch.</b>
<b>You had to make a decision.</b>

02:06.359 --> 02:09.295
<b>Nobody envied you,</b>
<b>but you made it, move forward.</b>

02:09.329 --> 02:11.964
<b>- But you got $10,000, girl.</b>
<b>Halleloo.</b>

02:11.998 --> 02:13.466
<b>- Congratulations.</b>

02:13.499 --> 02:16.602
<b>- But it's like not winning.</b>

02:16.636 --> 02:18.838
<b>It's like--it feels</b>
<b>really bad.</b>

02:20.373 --> 02:23.343
<b>- Mama, girl, oh.</b>

02:23.376 --> 02:25.678
<b>Ms. BenDeLa is giving</b>
<b>y'all you boo-hoo fish</b>

02:25.712 --> 02:27.347
<b>over here at the mirror.</b>

02:27.380 --> 02:31.050
<b>Girl, she sent Morgan home</b>
<b>because Morgan was saying,</b>

02:31.084 --> 02:32.285
<b>"Oh, let's get rid of</b>
<b>the strong competition",</b>

02:32.318 --> 02:33.953
<b>and BenDeLa's a</b>
<b>strong competitor.</b>

02:33.987 --> 02:35.555
<b>That's the reason</b>
<b>she sent her home.</b>

02:35.588 --> 02:38.424
<b>Miss DeLa is playing the game</b>
<b>just like the rest of us.</b>

02:39.492 --> 02:41.561
<b>- Well, I just want you</b>
<b>to know that</b>

02:41.594 --> 02:44.597
<b>you didn't make</b>
<b>the wrong decision,</b>

02:44.630 --> 02:47.767
<b>and I'm just gonna try</b>
<b>to rock it out for you, baby.</b>

02:47.800 --> 02:50.036
<b>- Spritz, spritz, bish.</b>

02:50.069 --> 02:52.672
<b>- So here's to Morgan,</b>
<b>everybody.</b>

02:52.705 --> 02:54.707
<b>- Here's to Morgan.</b>

02:54.741 --> 02:57.877
<b>- So if you, Miss Thing,</b>
<b>had won that lip sync,</b>

02:57.910 --> 02:59.445
<b>what is in your kitty?</b>

03:01.247 --> 03:04.317
<b>- I chose, uh, Chi Chi.</b>

03:04.350 --> 03:05.785
<b>- Oh Lordy.</b>

03:05.818 --> 03:09.055
<b>- It's uncomfortable because</b>
<b>Chi Chi's right there.</b>

03:09.088 --> 03:12.125
<b>- It was really just based on</b>
<b>the judges giving her a harder,</b>

03:12.158 --> 03:14.560
<b>like, critique for everything.</b>

03:14.594 --> 03:16.796
<b>- Really?</b>
<b>Okay.</b>

03:16.829 --> 03:20.933
<b>Well, trust me, don't--don't--</b>
<b>don't--don't--don't ever sleep</b>

03:20.967 --> 03:24.070
<b>on Chi Chi DeVayne, boo, because</b>
<b>I got something for that ass.</b>

03:24.103 --> 03:27.640
<b>- So Chi Chi, you're taking</b>
<b>Aja out next time?</b>

03:27.674 --> 03:30.276
<b>- Let's get the [bleep]</b>
<b>out of this!</b>

03:30.309 --> 03:31.511
<b>- I'm getting all</b>
<b>these body suits</b>

03:31.544 --> 03:32.912
<b>and I'm gonna go burn them.</b>

03:32.945 --> 03:35.415
<b>I'm thankful that I wasn't</b>
<b>in the bottom two</b>

03:35.448 --> 03:37.950
<b>this first challenge,</b>
<b>and so my goal now</b>

03:37.984 --> 03:39.752
<b>is to try to get</b>
<b>in that top two.</b>

03:39.786 --> 03:42.689
<b>Live to fight another day.</b>
<b>- Yes, we do.</b>

03:42.722 --> 03:44.857
<b>- I'm coming at this like</b>
<b>"Game of Thrones," okay?</b>

03:44.891 --> 03:47.994
<b>I am the Daenerys Targaryen</b>
<b>of drag.</b>

03:48.027 --> 03:49.996
<b>Shangela Stormborn.</b>

03:50.029 --> 03:53.232
<b>Baby, I'm the mother of dragons,</b>
<b>I'm the breaker of chains.</b>

03:53.232 --> 03:54.634
<b>I'm coming for the crown.</b>

03:54.667 --> 03:57.236
<b>[chuckles]</b>

03:57.270 --> 04:01.341
<b>Y'all, give me some powder</b>
<b>'cause I feel sweaty. Oh!</b>

<b>It is a new day, honey, yes.</b>
<b>Ha-ha!</b>

04:41.214 --> 04:44.617
<b>- After last week,</b>
<b>I just think the competition</b>

04:44.650 --> 04:45.852
<b>has really turned, um--</b>

04:45.885 --> 04:48.287
<b>- Everybody came to play.</b>

04:48.321 --> 04:50.223
<b>The variety show was,</b>
<b>I thought, amazing.</b>

04:50.223 --> 04:51.290
<b>- Yeah.</b>

04:51.324 --> 04:52.759
<b>- I had no idea who was</b>
<b>gonna be in the bottom.</b>

04:52.792 --> 04:56.295
<b>- I thought about it</b>
<b>and actually there were</b>

04:56.329 --> 05:01.067
<b>other people that didn't</b>
<b>show as much talent.</b>

05:01.100 --> 05:03.469
<b>- Do you have any opinions,</b>
<b>if you want to share them?</b>

05:03.503 --> 05:05.538
<b>- Milk.</b>

05:05.571 --> 05:07.807
<b>- Oh, she done shook</b>
<b>the table, honey.</b>

05:07.840 --> 05:10.410
<b>[laughs]</b>

05:10.443 --> 05:14.714
<b>- I just felt like it really</b>
<b>wasn't much talent there</b>

05:14.747 --> 05:16.949
<b>besides that it was</b>
<b>your original song.</b>

05:16.983 --> 05:18.685
<b>- Oh, God.</b>

05:18.718 --> 05:22.021
<b>My performance was killer,</b>
<b>and the original song</b>

05:22.055 --> 05:26.592
<b>is gonna become a bigger hit</b>
<b>than "Supermodel."</b>

05:26.626 --> 05:31.331
<b>I thought I had a wonderful</b>
<b>mix of talents in there.</b>

05:31.364 --> 05:34.600
<b>- Milk, your talent</b>
<b>can't be Velcro.</b>

05:34.634 --> 05:37.503
<b>- I would've loved to come on</b>
<b>and skate for all y'all,</b>

05:37.537 --> 05:40.206
<b>but ice is hard to come by.</b>

05:40.239 --> 05:43.343

06:33.526 --> 06:36.429
<b>[cheering]</b>

06:38.197 --> 06:40.199
<b>to be nominated by yourself.</b>

06:40.233 --> 06:41.734
<b>[laughing]</b>

06:41.768 --> 06:44.570

<b>[cheering]</b>

08:15.695 --> 08:17.230
<b>- Oh, my God.</b>

08:17.230 --> 08:20.400
<b>- All right, Mother,</b>
<b>all right.</b>

08:20.433 --> 08:24.237
<b>- And for this week's runway,</b>
<b>the category is Ru-demption.</b>

<b>We're giving you</b>
<b>a chance to do over</b>

08:27.607 --> 08:31.844
<b>your most infamous Drag Race</b>
<b>fashion fails.</b>

<b>- Oh.</b>

08:33.179 --> 08:36.182
<b>- I've got a lot of those.</b>
<b>- Uh-huh.</b>

08:36.215 --> 08:40.320
<b>- Gentlemen, start your engines,</b>

<b>- Thank you!</b>
<b>- Love you, Mother.</b>

<b>- Ladies and gentlemen,</b>

08:45.191 --> 08:49.796
<b>welcome to "VH1 Divas Live".</b>

08:49.829 --> 08:51.964
<b>- There's different levels of</b>
<b>lip sync artistry in the room.</b>

08:51.998 --> 08:53.599
<b>Some people are</b>
<b>professional lip syncers.</b>

08:53.633 --> 08:57.437
<b>- ♪ I don't care </b>
<b>if people stare ♪</b>

08:57.470 --> 09:00.440
<b>- Some people can actually</b>
<b>do their character better.</b>

09:02.608 --> 09:04.811
<b>So it's hard to say</b>
<b>what's really gonna happen.</b>

09:04.844 --> 09:07.880
<b>- All of these sections really</b>
<b>give us a huge chance to shine.</b>

09:07.914 --> 09:09.349
<b>- Yeah.</b>

09:09.382 --> 09:11.784
<b>- Like the cards aren't stacked</b>
<b>by what we have been given.</b>

09:11.818 --> 09:14.320
<b>- Well, I feel like</b>
<b>everybody's diva</b>

09:14.354 --> 09:16.356
<b>is a representative of</b>
<b>a little bit of them.</b>

09:16.389 --> 09:18.558
<b>- Stevie Nicks could not be</b>
<b>more perfect for me,</b>

09:18.591 --> 09:21.761
<b>however, when have you ever</b>
<b>seen Stevie Nicks do something</b>

09:21.794 --> 09:25.031
<b>where some gay is in</b>
<b>the front row of her show</b>

09:25.064 --> 09:26.699
<b>going like, "Work, Stevie.</b>
<b>You better [bleep] work!"</b>

09:26.733 --> 09:30.169
<b>No. That's not Stevie.</b>

09:30.169 --> 09:31.871
<b>I'm lucky that</b>
<b>I have less lyrics,</b>

09:31.904 --> 09:35.208
<b>however, I think mine</b>
<b>was less funny.</b>

09:35.241 --> 09:37.043
<b>It's really not fair.</b>

09:37.076 --> 09:39.045
<b>There is no way,</b>
<b>because I'm Stevie,</b>

09:39.078 --> 09:40.346
<b>I'm ever gonna win this.</b>

09:40.380 --> 09:41.647
<b>And I come right after you,</b>

09:41.681 --> 09:45.284
<b>and you literally are</b>
<b>set up to just win.</b>

09:45.318 --> 09:47.186
<b>- Oh, no.</b>
<b>- Just face it, girl.</b>

09:47.186 --> 09:48.187
<b>- Mine--let me tell you--no.</b>
<b>- All right.</b>

09:48.187 --> 09:49.489
<b>- Let me tell you though.</b>

09:49.522 --> 09:50.690
<b>- If you're gonna</b>
<b>argue that, you're crazy.</b>

09:50.723 --> 09:52.892
<b>- I could take Amy Winehouse--</b>
<b>- Oh, I know.</b>

09:52.925 --> 09:54.427
<b>- Dolly, and</b>
<b>make them all funny.</b>

09:54.460 --> 09:56.562
<b>- I'm trying not to be like</b>
<b>a conspiracy theorist</b>

09:56.596 --> 09:58.731
<b>because that's what</b>
<b>I was in Season 8.</b>

09:58.765 --> 10:03.302
<b>It's just hard because I feel</b>
<b>like I'm being set up to fail.</b>

10:03.336 --> 10:04.937
<b>- I love my part.</b>
<b>- Okay.</b>

10:04.971 --> 10:10.543
<b>- When it comes to impersonating</b>
<b>Celine, I am feeling good.</b>

10:10.576 --> 10:13.046
<b>These other girls will have</b>
<b>a tough act to follow.</b>

10:13.079 --> 10:14.480
<b>- What are you wearing?</b>

10:14.514 --> 10:18.217
<b>- I'm wearing her Met Gala</b>
<b>outfit from this past year,</b>

10:18.217 --> 10:19.786
<b>which is like a</b>
<b>silver leotard</b>

10:19.819 --> 10:22.121
<b>with like a Versace dress</b>
<b>over top of it.</b>

10:22.221 --> 10:23.423
<b>- Do you think everybody's</b>
<b>gonna recognize that?</b>

10:23.456 --> 10:24.424
<b>Like I don't know how</b>
<b>iconic that was</b>

10:24.457 --> 10:25.625
<b>because I didn't pay attention.</b>

10:25.658 --> 10:26.626
<b>- I--I can't think of</b>
<b>anything she wears</b>

10:26.659 --> 10:27.960
<b>except that backward suit.</b>

10:27.994 --> 10:30.229
<b>- The reason I want to choose</b>
<b>the Met Gala thing was</b>

10:30.263 --> 10:33.866
<b>because this year her</b>
<b>fashion star is on the rise.</b>

10:33.900 --> 10:37.270
<b>- Girl, nobody knows what</b>
<b>Celine wore to the Met Gala.</b>

10:37.303 --> 10:38.604
<b>That's such a weird choice.</b>

10:38.638 --> 10:40.406
<b>A really weird choice.</b>

10:40.440 --> 10:43.176
<b>- I did this one event where</b>
<b>I performed Celine in front of--</b>

10:43.176 --> 10:44.711
<b>- Oh, you've done Celine before?</b>

10:44.744 --> 10:47.280
<b>- Yeah. In front of the guy</b>

10:47.313 --> 10:50.216
<b>that was the event planner</b>
<b>for her wedding.</b>

10:50.249 --> 10:52.418
<b>And so as soon as he saw</b>
<b>me perform it, he was like,</b>

10:52.452 --> 10:54.487
<b>"Oh, my God, that</b>
<b>is the best Celine."</b>

10:54.520 --> 10:56.389
<b>- Well, good luck, because</b>
<b>I think Ariana Grande</b>

10:56.422 --> 10:59.592
<b>does the best Celine, but</b>
<b>you can be a close second.</b>

10:59.625 --> 11:00.994
<b>Ahh!</b>

11:01.027 --> 11:03.463
<b>Honey, the big and Milky,</b>
<b>she is mighty confident, Mama,</b>

11:03.496 --> 11:05.832
<b>because the friend of a friend</b>
<b>of a friend who was a friend</b>

11:05.865 --> 11:08.034
<b>of a friend of a friend</b>
<b>of Celine's had told her</b>

11:08.067 --> 11:09.602
<b>it was lovely, girl.</b>

11:09.635 --> 11:12.438
<b>Oh, she's about to throw the</b>
<b>diamond into the ocean, honey.</b>

11:12.472 --> 11:15.742
<b>She's about to give it to y'all.</b>
<b>Well, all right.</b>

11:15.775 --> 11:16.876
<b>- Coming up...</b>

11:16.909 --> 11:19.078
<b>- Five, six, Kennedy,</b>
<b>where you at?</b>

11:19.112 --> 11:20.380
<b>- I got lost.</b>

11:20.413 --> 11:24.417
<b>- Shangela is pissing me off,</b>
<b>pissing Todrick off,</b>

11:24.450 --> 11:26.753
<b>practically</b>
<b>pissing off everyone.</b>

11:26.786 --> 11:28.187
<b>- Ah!</b>

11:28.221 --> 11:30.356
<b>Okay.</b>

11:36.452 --> 11:38.353
<b>- Hi.</b>
<b>- Hello.</b>

11:38.387 --> 11:39.822
<b>- Hi!</b>

11:39.855 --> 11:43.058
<b>- Our maxi challenge this week</b>
<b>is to perform in our very own</b>

11:43.092 --> 11:46.628
<b>version of "VH1's Divas Live".</b>

11:46.662 --> 11:49.765
<b>It's time to rehearse</b>
<b>with Todrick Hall.</b>

11:49.798 --> 11:52.067
<b>I hope the other girls</b>
<b>are ready, 'cause I am.</b>

11:52.101 --> 11:53.936
<b>- How y'all doing?</b>
<b>- Good.</b>

11:53.969 --> 11:58.107
<b>- We about to bring it with the</b>
<b>diva's--oh, Lord, here we go.</b>

11:58.140 --> 12:01.443
<b>[laughter]</b>

12:01.477 --> 12:03.178
<b>- She's already</b>
<b>in full character.</b>

12:06.115 --> 12:08.183
<b>- Bitch, excuse me?</b>

12:08.217 --> 12:09.385
<b>Are you ready?</b>

12:09.418 --> 12:13.122
<b>- I'm sorry, darling.</b>

12:13.155 --> 12:15.324
<b>I'm a method actress, okay?</b>

12:15.357 --> 12:17.059
<b>I'm giving y'all</b>

12:17.092 --> 12:19.795
<b>very Meryl Streep</b>
<b>in this moment.</b>

12:23.365 --> 12:25.467
<b>- This is the "Divas" episode,</b>
<b>and you guys are gonna be</b>

12:25.501 --> 12:27.403
<b>impersonating some of the</b>
<b>most iconic,</b>

12:27.436 --> 12:29.471
<b>legendary performers</b>
<b>of all time,</b>

12:29.505 --> 12:31.340
<b>so we definitely want</b>
<b>to represent them well.</b>

12:31.373 --> 12:32.474
<b>Are you guys ready?</b>

12:32.508 --> 12:33.842
<b>- Yes.</b>
<b>- Okay.</b>

12:33.876 --> 12:35.310
<b>Well, we're gonna</b>
<b>start with Kennedy,</b>

12:35.344 --> 12:36.545
<b>and everybody else</b>
<b>please have a seat.</b>

12:36.578 --> 12:39.815
<b>Okay. You're gonna go</b>
<b>five, four, three,</b>

12:39.848 --> 12:42.151
<b>you just bend</b>
<b>your leg, two, walk.</b>

12:42.184 --> 12:45.320
<b>Five, four, three, two.</b>

12:45.354 --> 12:47.056
<b>- Do I step my leg back out?</b>

12:47.089 --> 12:48.290
<b>- Yeah, let me see it.</b>

12:48.323 --> 12:50.292
<b>Five, six, seven, eight.</b>

12:50.292 --> 12:53.862
<b>And five, four, three...</b>

12:53.896 --> 12:56.999
<b>- Kennedy Davenport is known</b>
<b>for being a fierce queen</b>

12:57.032 --> 12:58.801
<b>that can dance the house down,</b>

12:58.834 --> 13:00.669
<b>but right now</b>
<b>the house is still up.</b>

13:00.702 --> 13:02.471
<b>No chance of it</b>
<b>even shattering.</b>

13:02.504 --> 13:04.306
<b>Don't need insurance because</b>
<b>it's not gonna come down.</b>

13:04.339 --> 13:06.942
<b>And da, da, three, four,</b>
<b>and five.</b>

13:06.975 --> 13:08.811
<b>Okay.</b>

13:08.844 --> 13:10.079
<b>Are you gonna be able</b>
<b>to get that?</b>

13:10.112 --> 13:11.313
<b>- I'll get it.</b>

13:11.346 --> 13:13.215
<b>You have to understand</b>
<b>I am a dancer,</b>

13:13.315 --> 13:14.783
<b>but I freestyle everything.</b>

13:14.817 --> 13:18.053
<b>I don't choreograph anything, so</b>
<b>it's just tough on me right now.</b>

13:19.621 --> 13:21.356
<b>- Can we move on?</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

13:21.390 --> 13:22.624
<b>- Let's go slow.</b>

13:22.658 --> 13:24.660
<b>Five, six, seven, eight.</b>

13:24.693 --> 13:26.628
<b>And one, two, three, four--</b>
<b>- I'm lost.</b>

13:26.662 --> 13:28.864
<b>- Kennedy, where you at?</b>
<b>- I got lost.</b>

13:28.897 --> 13:30.699
<b>- Is this gonna be</b>
<b>too complicated?</b>

13:30.733 --> 13:33.635
<b>- I mean, I can get it, but</b>
<b>I'm having trouble right now.</b>

13:33.669 --> 13:36.405
<b>- Are you telling me</b>
<b>you're giving up already?</b>

13:36.438 --> 13:38.173
<b>- Well, don't ask me--</b>
<b>I'm gonna give you my honest--</b>

13:38.273 --> 13:39.541
<b>give you my honest answer.</b>

13:39.575 --> 13:41.343
<b>- I just wanted--I--I want</b>
<b>you to say "Yes, I can get it."</b>

13:41.376 --> 13:42.778
<b>- I can get it.</b>
<b>- Okay.</b>

13:42.811 --> 13:44.313
<b>- Right now it's</b>
<b>not registering.</b>

13:44.346 --> 13:46.148
<b>- Okay.</b>
<b>Tomorrow, no matter what,</b>

13:46.181 --> 13:48.183
<b>you can't let your back-up</b>
<b>dancers upstage you.</b>

13:48.283 --> 13:50.352
<b>- 'Cause I'm coming</b>
<b>for you back here, baby.</b>

13:50.386 --> 13:52.154
<b>- Ooh!</b>

13:52.187 --> 13:53.956
<b>- We'll be ready.</b>

13:53.989 --> 13:55.557
<b>Okay, Thorgy Thor.</b>

13:55.591 --> 13:56.925
<b>- I want to win</b>
<b>a challenge</b>

13:56.959 --> 13:59.061
<b>'cause I never won one</b>
<b>on Season 8.</b>

13:59.094 --> 14:01.296
<b>[bleep] you, Bob.</b>

14:01.330 --> 14:03.298
<b>- I am not gonna give you</b>
<b>that much choreography.</b>

14:03.298 --> 14:04.433
<b>We're gonna collaborate.</b>

14:04.466 --> 14:05.868
<b>So I want to know</b>
<b>if there are any things</b>

14:05.901 --> 14:08.404
<b>that you specifically want to do</b>
<b>or that you had in mind to do?</b>

14:08.437 --> 14:09.938
<b>- Sure.</b>

14:09.972 --> 14:13.308
<b>♪ Tell me one thing, do you</b>
<b>like where you're going ♪</b>

14:13.308 --> 14:16.779
<b>♪ I said who do you think</b>
<b>you are? ♪</b>

14:16.812 --> 14:18.514
<b>- Okay.</b>

14:18.547 --> 14:21.050
<b>Um, who is Stevie Nicks</b>
<b>to you?</b>

14:21.083 --> 14:24.386
<b>- Stevie Nicks is one of</b>
<b>my biggest inspirational divas</b>

14:24.420 --> 14:25.521
<b>throughout my entire life.</b>

14:25.554 --> 14:26.955
<b>I love her.</b>
<b>I love her.</b>

14:26.989 --> 14:28.724
<b>The stereotype is</b>
<b>that she's this witch,</b>

14:28.757 --> 14:30.325
<b>but she actually</b>
<b>is not a witch.</b>

14:30.325 --> 14:31.860
<b>She's just an eccentric Gemini.</b>

14:31.894 --> 14:35.264
<b>- Girl, if you're gonna bring</b>
<b>it, you have to bring it.</b>

14:35.264 --> 14:38.300
<b>With the rumor that Stevie's</b>
<b>a witch, you can do so much.</b>

14:38.333 --> 14:41.003
<b>Like, bitch, I would've came</b>
<b>out with a pot, a broom.</b>

14:41.036 --> 14:43.439
<b>I would've came out like,</b>
<b>with a--with a wand,</b>

14:43.472 --> 14:45.107
<b>like whoo! Whoo!</b>

14:45.140 --> 14:47.443
<b>- So I think we</b>
<b>should incorporate</b>

14:47.476 --> 14:49.178
<b>some of the stuff that</b>
<b>you're naturally doing</b>

14:49.278 --> 14:50.279
<b>and make it choreography.</b>

14:50.279 --> 14:51.847
<b>So when it gets</b>
<b>to the chorus, can you,</b>

14:51.880 --> 14:55.117
<b>like, lean this way</b>
<b>a little bit?</b>

14:55.150 --> 14:59.021
<b>- She's not a very, like,</b>
<b>active, acrobatic, you know.</b>

14:59.054 --> 15:00.422
<b>- Person, yeah.</b>
<b>I just wanna see--</b>

15:00.456 --> 15:01.924
<b>- She's just so strong.</b>

15:01.957 --> 15:03.125
<b>There's usually a wind machine</b>
<b>underneath her or something.</b>

15:03.158 --> 15:04.860
<b>- Yeah. We gave our</b>
<b>wind machine to Beyonce,</b>

15:04.893 --> 15:05.861
<b>so we're not gonna</b>
<b>have that today.</b>

15:05.894 --> 15:07.196
<b>- Oops.</b>

15:07.296 --> 15:09.298
<b>- But we will pretend that</b>
<b>the wind machine is here.</b>

15:09.331 --> 15:12.134
<b>Thorgy is such a Stevie Nicks</b>
<b>purist that he kept saying,</b>

15:12.167 --> 15:13.669
<b>"Stevie Nicks doesn't</b>
<b>really do this.</b>

15:13.702 --> 15:15.170
<b>She doesn't really dance."</b>

15:15.204 --> 15:17.973
<b>And I think that's great to</b>
<b>know your character so well,</b>

15:18.006 --> 15:21.744
<b>but what can you do to make</b>
<b>a drag version of Stevie Nicks?</b>

15:21.777 --> 15:23.712
<b>- She's at a microphone</b>
<b>and she's--</b>

15:23.746 --> 15:25.581
<b>it's all internal and like...</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

15:25.614 --> 15:27.383
<b>But I think that it's a kind</b>
<b>of a touchy situation,</b>

15:27.416 --> 15:30.652
<b>because I don't want you</b>
<b>to get lost in the shuffle.</b>

15:30.686 --> 15:34.089
<b>- Stevie Nicks is difficult</b>
<b>to do because</b>

15:34.123 --> 15:37.259
<b>next to divas like Diana Ross</b>
<b>and Patti LaBelle</b>

15:37.259 --> 15:38.794
<b>and Janet Jackson,</b>

15:38.827 --> 15:41.263
<b>she is not like, work,</b>
<b>you know what I mean?</b>

15:41.296 --> 15:43.298
<b>It just doesn't feel fair.</b>

15:46.668 --> 15:49.171
<b>Because it's gonna seem a</b>
<b>little too subdued, right?</b>

15:49.271 --> 15:51.974
<b>- What, you mean, like levels?</b>
<b>What are you doing--</b>

15:52.007 --> 15:54.476
<b>- When I'm spinning</b>
<b>like, I don't--</b>

15:54.510 --> 15:57.312
<b>It's incredibly important</b>
<b>to stand out amongst</b>

15:57.346 --> 15:59.681
<b>all these girls because</b>
<b>we're all so talented,</b>

15:59.715 --> 16:02.484
<b>but how do you stand out</b>
<b>performing as Stevie Nicks?</b>

16:02.518 --> 16:04.086
<b>That's my problem.</b>

16:04.119 --> 16:07.022
<b>- All right. Let's bring up</b>
<b>Ms. Mariah Carey.</b>

16:07.056 --> 16:09.725
<b>- She is on another level today.</b>
<b>Oh, my God.</b>

16:09.758 --> 16:13.896
<b>Shangela doing her whole</b>
<b>Mariah fantasy...</b>

16:13.929 --> 16:17.299
<b>Girl, she's pissing me off,</b>
<b>she's pissing Todrick off,</b>

16:17.299 --> 16:18.901
<b>practically</b>
<b>pissing off everyone.</b>

16:18.934 --> 16:21.103
<b>- Ah!</b>

16:21.136 --> 16:23.705
<b>Okay.</b>

16:23.739 --> 16:26.642
<b>Jealousy is a killer</b>
<b>in this industry, Mama.</b>

16:26.675 --> 16:28.444
<b>- Let's play the music--</b>
<b>- Okay.</b>

16:28.477 --> 16:29.611
<b>- --and hear what</b>
<b>Mariah's gonna do.</b>

16:29.645 --> 16:31.146
<b>- Is it in my ear?</b>
<b>Hold on, baby.</b>

16:31.180 --> 16:32.214
<b>- Oh, Lord.</b>

16:32.314 --> 16:35.784
<b>- Ew.</b>
<b>I cannot--I cannot with this.</b>

16:35.818 --> 16:38.387
<b>- Oh, my God, the girls</b>
<b>are so hateful this season.</b>

16:38.420 --> 16:40.522
<b>Why they so hateful?</b>

16:40.556 --> 16:42.357
<b>[laughs]</b>
<b>- Okay, I'm ready.</b>

16:42.391 --> 16:43.726
<b>- The girls are shading me.</b>

16:43.759 --> 16:45.994
<b>They're like, oh, she really</b>
<b>thinks she is the diva.</b>

16:46.028 --> 16:48.797
<b>And some are joking,</b>
<b>but some are serious.</b>

16:48.831 --> 16:50.833
<b>- You're gonna cover her up</b>
<b>with the fans.</b>

16:50.866 --> 16:53.168
<b>- Okay.</b>
<b>- So everybody take a fan.</b>

16:53.268 --> 16:54.269
<b>- Oh!</b>
<b>- Whoo!</b>

16:54.269 --> 16:55.571
<b>- Sister.</b>

16:55.604 --> 16:59.742
<b>Oh, girl, the big and</b>
<b>Milky, honey, oh, girl.</b>

16:59.775 --> 17:02.010
<b>She's throwing shade and</b>
<b>then she plays it off</b>

17:02.044 --> 17:03.946
<b>that she's just trying to be</b>
<b>loose and fun with the girls.</b>

17:03.979 --> 17:05.848
<b>She's not being loose and fun.</b>

17:05.881 --> 17:08.917
<b>Honey, she thinks she's better</b>
<b>than everyone in this room.</b>

17:08.951 --> 17:10.486
<b>- And then she's</b>
<b>gonna walk forward.</b>

17:10.519 --> 17:12.654
<b>I'm not gonna be here</b>
<b>to hold your hand.</b>

17:12.688 --> 17:14.390
<b>- I'm sorry.</b>
<b>I saw the hand.</b>

17:14.423 --> 17:15.457
<b>- You might have to walk</b>
<b>on your own.</b>

17:15.491 --> 17:17.159
<b>- I'm sorry.</b>
<b>I saw the hand.</b>

17:17.192 --> 17:21.296
<b>- Shangela, step down from your</b>
<b>high horse and just chill.</b>

17:22.664 --> 17:24.366
<b>- All right. Ms. Ross?</b>

17:24.400 --> 17:26.935
<b>- Yes.</b>
<b>- It's your time, darling.</b>

17:26.969 --> 17:28.404
<b>- Thank you.</b>

17:28.437 --> 17:31.573
<b>- I don't want to pressure you,</b>
<b>but you do know that Diana Ross</b>

17:31.607 --> 17:34.042
<b>is RuPaul's, like,</b>
<b>diva of all time?</b>

17:35.711 --> 17:38.680
<b>This is a very Bianca Del Rio/</b>
<b>Judge Judy situation--</b>

17:38.714 --> 17:40.516
<b>- I know.</b>
<b>- --but to the umpteenth power.</b>

17:40.549 --> 17:42.317
<b>You understand that?</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

17:42.351 --> 17:44.153
<b>- And if you don't</b>
<b>fully embody Diana Ross,</b>

17:44.253 --> 17:45.421
<b>he's gonna for sure know.</b>

17:45.454 --> 17:48.257
<b>- Okay, Todrick, just keep</b>
<b>adding that pressure on.</b>

17:50.559 --> 17:53.028
<b>No, no, no.</b>
<b>I really--I feel--I'm excited.</b>

17:53.062 --> 17:57.633
<b>I'm excited that I get</b>
<b>to play the real diva.</b>

17:57.666 --> 17:58.634
<b>- Just show me</b>
<b>what you would do.</b>

17:58.667 --> 18:01.036
<b>Just take the stage, own it.</b>

18:07.810 --> 18:10.846
<b>- BeBe does nothing.</b>
<b>Nothing.</b>

18:10.879 --> 18:14.550
<b>Just walks out as Diana Ross,</b>
<b>but that's what BeBe does.</b>

18:14.583 --> 18:16.618
<b>It's who BeBe is.</b>

18:16.652 --> 18:19.288
<b>Okay. Okay.</b>

18:21.657 --> 18:24.893
<b>- Diana is known to steal</b>
<b>the party, steal the show,</b>

18:24.927 --> 18:27.830
<b>and this show</b>
<b>was far from stolen.</b>

18:31.300 --> 18:32.668
<b>- That's great.</b>
<b>I love it.</b>

18:35.137 --> 18:37.106
<b>So we're gonna do</b>
<b>you, BenDeLaCreme.</b>

18:37.139 --> 18:39.308
<b>This is the thing,</b>
<b>the juxtaposition of you</b>

18:39.341 --> 18:42.144
<b>rapping this as Julie Andrews</b>
<b>is what makes this funny,</b>

18:42.244 --> 18:44.646
<b>so it has to be</b>
<b>a mixture of swag</b>

18:44.680 --> 18:46.248
<b>and then some</b>
<b>pixie dust, okay?</b>

18:46.281 --> 18:49.151
<b>Like, dun da da,</b>
<b>body like boom.</b>

18:50.652 --> 18:52.454
<b>- Like that kind of thing?</b>

18:52.488 --> 18:54.323
<b>- But with a little bit</b>
<b>more swag juice in it, okay?</b>

18:54.356 --> 18:55.557
<b>- Okay.</b>

18:55.591 --> 18:56.925
<b>- So you're gonna take</b>
<b>three steps, one--</b>

18:56.959 --> 18:58.293
<b>- One, two, three.</b>

18:58.327 --> 19:00.028
<b>- One, two, three, and four,</b>
<b>and you're gonna touch</b>

19:00.062 --> 19:02.398
<b>your vagina with</b>
<b>one hand at a time.</b>

19:02.431 --> 19:03.966
<b>- On four.</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

19:03.999 --> 19:06.001
<b>Can I see you all do that?</b>
<b>Three and four.</b>

19:06.034 --> 19:08.437
<b>And you gotta make</b>
<b>sure you go three and four.</b>

19:08.470 --> 19:11.774
<b>Two, three--</b>
<b>- Okay, sorry.</b>

19:11.807 --> 19:14.143
<b>- DeLa, there's a</b>
<b>lot of footwork going on</b>

19:14.176 --> 19:16.145
<b>that is not the footwork</b>
<b>that we need.</b>

19:16.178 --> 19:20.082
<b>I'm very, very worried.</b>
<b>Can she handle it?</b>

19:20.115 --> 19:22.151
<b>I don't damn know.</b>

19:22.184 --> 19:24.286
<b>I know you're coming off of</b>
<b>a good win, but I can't express</b>

19:24.286 --> 19:26.789
<b>to you enough that it has to,</b>
<b>has to, has to be, like,</b>

19:26.822 --> 19:29.425
<b>swag, it has to be the lyrics,</b>
<b>it has to be still in character.</b>

19:29.458 --> 19:30.659
<b>- I totally hear that.</b>

19:30.692 --> 19:33.562
<b>- If you slip up</b>
<b>one step, you're [bleep].</b>

19:33.595 --> 19:34.897
<b>- Yeah.</b>

19:34.930 --> 19:37.566
<b>Todrick stares straight into</b>
<b>your soul</b>

19:37.599 --> 19:40.369
<b>with those crazy,</b>
<b>honey-colored eyes,</b>

19:40.402 --> 19:43.105
<b>and finds whatever you're</b>
<b>most insecure about,</b>

19:43.138 --> 19:44.740
<b>and is like, don't do it.</b>

19:44.773 --> 19:47.376
<b>He is terrifying.</b>

19:53.115 --> 19:56.285
<b>- Okay. Chi Chi DeVayne.</b>

19:56.318 --> 19:58.020
<b>And we're also gonna</b>
<b>have Dolly Parton</b>

19:58.053 --> 20:00.389
<b>and Celine Dion in this part.</b>

20:00.422 --> 20:03.092
<b>- Okay.</b>

20:03.125 --> 20:05.260
<b>Todrick is randomly</b>
<b>choosing divas</b>

20:05.260 --> 20:07.029
<b>to be part of other</b>
<b>divas' solo numbers,</b>

20:07.062 --> 20:08.464
<b>and I noticed that</b>
<b>he wasn't choosing me.</b>

20:08.497 --> 20:10.866
<b>- And BeBe should be in this.</b>

20:10.899 --> 20:13.869
<b>- So I was like, this is</b>
<b>my chance to stand out.</b>

20:13.902 --> 20:16.672
<b>- Shangela should be in this,</b>
<b>and Kennedy should be in it.</b>

20:16.705 --> 20:17.973
<b>- Todrick?</b>
<b>- Yes.</b>

20:18.006 --> 20:19.475
<b>- I haven't been</b>
<b>part of anything.</b>

20:19.508 --> 20:21.076
<b>I feel like I'm the only one</b>
<b>who hasn't done anything.</b>

20:21.110 --> 20:22.578
<b>- Come.</b>

20:22.611 --> 20:25.314
<b>- I will seize the day in order</b>
<b>to kick everyone's ass and win.</b>

20:25.347 --> 20:26.749
<b>- Thank you.</b>
<b>I--I love that.</b>

20:26.782 --> 20:28.917
<b>Sure.</b>

20:28.951 --> 20:32.187
<b>- I can tell that Thorgy really</b>
<b>wants to try and do more,</b>

20:32.287 --> 20:35.324
<b>but I'm thinking she should</b>
<b>be focusing more on making</b>

20:35.357 --> 20:37.226
<b>her character bigger,</b>
<b>not necessarily</b>

20:37.226 --> 20:39.228
<b>in being in so</b>
<b>many people's numbers.</b>

20:39.228 --> 20:43.432
<b>- One, two, three, four, five,</b>
<b>six, seven, eight, and pose.</b>

20:43.465 --> 20:45.234
<b>Okay.</b>
<b>We can move on to the next girl.</b>

20:45.234 --> 20:46.602
<b>Can I have Trixie?</b>

20:46.635 --> 20:48.871
<b>- Thanks for including me.</b>

20:48.904 --> 20:50.539
<b>- Honestly, I think</b>
<b>the competition</b>

20:50.572 --> 20:52.908
<b>sometimes becomes</b>
<b>too much for Thorgy,</b>

20:52.941 --> 20:55.911
<b>because she really compares</b>
<b>herself to other people,</b>

20:55.944 --> 20:58.247
<b>and then she starts</b>
<b>to pick apart herself.</b>

21:01.316 --> 21:03.252
<b>- Mamacita is in her head.</b>

21:03.252 --> 21:04.353
<b>Good luck, sis.</b>

21:05.454 --> 21:06.855
<b>- [RuPaul] Coming up...</b>

21:06.889 --> 21:08.057
<b>- Watching yourself,</b>
<b>you see things</b>

21:08.090 --> 21:10.392
<b>about yourself that you</b>
<b>may not have realized.</b>

21:10.426 --> 21:11.627
<b>- Yeah, girl.</b>

21:11.660 --> 21:13.262
<b>I didn't know I had</b>
<b>a resting bitch face.</b>

21:14.730 --> 21:16.031
<b>- What?</b>
<b>- [laughs]</b>

21:16.065 --> 21:19.101
<b>- You're gonna get</b>
<b>two good double blinks.</b>

21:19.134 --> 21:20.669
<b>[laughs]</b>

21:26.729 --> 21:28.464
<b>- Whoo!</b>

21:28.497 --> 21:34.336
<b>- We are here. Oh!</b>

21:34.370 --> 21:37.039
<b>- Come on, divas.</b>
<b>- Good morning, everybody.</b>

21:37.072 --> 21:40.242
<b>- This week's runway</b>
<b>is Ru-demption, where we get</b>

21:40.276 --> 21:44.446
<b>to remake our worst fashion</b>
<b>faux pas,</b>

21:44.480 --> 21:45.614
<b>and this is gonna be</b>
<b>really interesting</b>

21:45.648 --> 21:46.949
<b>because a lot of these</b>
<b>girls have had some</b>

21:46.982 --> 21:49.418
<b>real ugly fashions,</b>
<b>including myself.</b>

21:50.619 --> 21:52.388
<b>Shangela.</b>
<b>- Yes, baby.</b>

21:52.421 --> 21:53.522
<b>- How you feeling, boo?</b>

21:53.556 --> 21:54.723
<b>- You know what?</b>

21:54.757 --> 21:55.724
<b>I'm less concerned</b>
<b>about the divas thing.</b>

21:55.758 --> 21:56.992
<b>- Uh-huh.</b>

21:57.026 --> 22:00.396
<b>- And more concerned about</b>
<b>the Ru-demption look,</b>

22:00.429 --> 22:05.501
<b>because not only is this a look</b>
<b>that I failed at last time,</b>

22:05.534 --> 22:10.139
<b>but also, Vanessa Williams was</b>
<b>the judge on the episode I got--</b>

22:10.172 --> 22:11.607
<b>- Gag!</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

22:11.640 --> 22:13.142
<b>When--of the fail</b>
<b>that I'm doing today.</b>

22:13.175 --> 22:15.110
<b>- So, if you [bleep] up,</b>
<b>she's gonna--</b>

22:15.144 --> 22:16.111
<b>- Twice in front</b>
<b>of Ms. Vanessa.</b>

22:16.145 --> 22:17.379
<b>- She's gonna see it.</b>

22:17.413 --> 22:19.615
<b>- I was actually a little</b>
<b>disappointed at first</b>

22:19.648 --> 22:22.651
<b>because your number</b>
<b>and Kennedy's number</b>

22:22.685 --> 22:25.955
<b>and Ben's number and</b>
<b>Chi Chi's number--</b>

22:25.988 --> 22:27.389
<b>- Everybody's number?</b>

22:27.423 --> 22:29.592
<b>- --all are, like, super high</b>
<b>energy numbers, and I love--</b>

22:29.625 --> 22:30.826
<b>- Do you think my number</b>
<b>is high energy?</b>

22:30.860 --> 22:32.061
<b>- Girl, you're doing</b>
<b>Amy Winehouse.</b>

22:32.094 --> 22:33.362
<b>You have dancers,</b>
<b>you have two backup dancers.</b>

22:33.395 --> 22:35.898
<b>I live for backup dancers.</b>

22:35.931 --> 22:36.999
<b>- You know, we did</b>
<b>a similar challenge</b>

22:37.032 --> 22:38.467
<b>like this on my season.</b>

22:38.501 --> 22:40.936
<b>We did Glamazonian Airways,</b>
<b>which was a lip sync challenge,</b>

22:40.970 --> 22:43.439
<b>and I did fine then and</b>
<b>wasn't scared,</b>

22:43.472 --> 22:45.508
<b>but there was also like twice</b>
<b>the number of people here,</b>

22:45.541 --> 22:46.642
<b>so I think that</b>
<b>was part of it.</b>

22:46.675 --> 22:47.910
<b>- Well, was the dancing</b>
<b>as intense?</b>

22:47.943 --> 22:51.147
<b>- God, no.</b>
<b>- This dance is--</b>

22:51.180 --> 22:52.248
<b>- Bananas.</b>

22:52.281 --> 22:53.582
<b>- I mean, I wasn't here</b>
<b>for All Stars 2,</b>

22:53.616 --> 22:56.118
<b>but I feel like this dance</b>
<b>seems to me like</b>

22:56.152 --> 22:58.087
<b>the most intense dance that</b>
<b>has been on this competition.</b>

22:58.120 --> 22:59.255
<b>- Oh, my God.</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

22:59.288 --> 23:00.623
<b>- I feel like</b>
<b>the Herstory of the World,</b>

23:00.656 --> 23:02.024
<b>they were like truly</b>
<b>lip syncing.</b>

23:02.057 --> 23:04.660
<b>This is like choreography.</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

23:04.693 --> 23:05.795
<b>- Do you think they're</b>
<b>gonna be looking</b>

23:05.828 --> 23:08.297
<b>for a full transformation</b>
<b>into the diva?</b>

23:08.397 --> 23:09.799
<b>- Absolutely.</b>
<b>- I think yes.</b>

23:09.832 --> 23:11.400
<b>I think they're looking</b>
<b>for likeness big time.</b>

23:11.400 --> 23:12.835
<b>- Really?</b>
<b>- Absolutely.</b>

23:12.868 --> 23:15.070
<b>Do you remember last season</b>
<b>when they clocked Katya's wig</b>

23:15.104 --> 23:17.907
<b>for not being perfectly</b>
<b>Diana's iconic hair?</b>

23:17.940 --> 23:18.908
<b>- Yeah.</b>

23:18.941 --> 23:20.009
<b>- He went home that episode.</b>

23:22.545 --> 23:24.346
<b>- Trixie, how do you</b>
<b>think you came off</b>

23:24.346 --> 23:25.881
<b>on your season, because--</b>

23:25.915 --> 23:27.550
<b>- I came off as</b>
<b>pretty talentless.</b>

23:27.583 --> 23:29.718
<b>- I disagree.</b>
<b>- I think it's pretty fair.</b>

23:29.752 --> 23:32.488
<b>I never won any challenges,</b>
<b>and I went home twice.</b>

23:32.521 --> 23:36.225
<b>- Shangela, how do you think you</b>
<b>were perceived on your season?</b>

23:36.258 --> 23:37.793
<b>- It was mixed.</b>

23:37.827 --> 23:40.129
<b>I mean, honestly, I would meet</b>
<b>people and they would be like,</b>

23:40.162 --> 23:42.231
<b>"Oh, my God, I love you,</b>
<b>and during your season</b>

23:42.264 --> 23:45.534
<b>"my boyfriend hated you,</b>
<b>but it's so nice to meet you</b>

23:45.568 --> 23:47.403
<b>in person because now</b>
<b>we both love you."</b>

23:47.436 --> 23:50.105
<b>And I'm like, "thank you."</b>
<b>- I get the same thing.</b>

23:50.139 --> 23:54.610
<b>It's like being thrown in a room</b>
<b>with people that you don't know.</b>

23:54.643 --> 23:55.911
<b>- Mm-hmm.</b>

23:55.945 --> 23:57.012
<b>- Somebody's gonna</b>
<b>get on your nerves.</b>

23:57.046 --> 23:58.481
<b>- Yes.</b>

23:58.514 --> 24:01.517
<b>- And then on top of that,</b>
<b>I'm very vocal about my feelings</b>

24:01.550 --> 24:02.985
<b>and how I feel about</b>
<b>a lot of things.</b>

24:03.018 --> 24:04.386
<b>- Yeah.</b>

24:04.420 --> 24:06.522
<b>But I take you different because</b>
<b>I know you and I know, like,</b>

24:06.555 --> 24:08.757
<b>that's a southern way of drag.</b>

24:08.791 --> 24:10.793
<b>Like, the girls get you</b>
<b>together in the room.</b>

24:10.826 --> 24:15.264
<b>Kennedy and I go way back, and</b>
<b>she is straight up not edited,</b>

24:15.297 --> 24:16.999
<b>not filtered, not watered down,</b>

24:17.032 --> 24:18.734
<b>and those lips are</b>
<b>gonna be pressed together</b>

24:18.767 --> 24:20.035
<b>and the eyes are</b>
<b>gonna be clocked,</b>

24:20.069 --> 24:22.037
<b>and you're gonna get</b>
<b>two good double blinks.</b>

24:23.706 --> 24:25.641
<b>I think that also watching</b>
<b>yourself--</b>

24:25.674 --> 24:26.642
<b>- Yeah.</b>

24:26.675 --> 24:27.810
<b>- --you see things</b>
<b>about yourself</b>

24:27.843 --> 24:29.912
<b>that you may not have realized.</b>
<b>- Yeah, girl.</b>

24:29.945 --> 24:31.780
<b>I didn't know I had</b>
<b>a resting bitch face.</b>

24:31.814 --> 24:33.949
<b>- You didn't know?</b>
<b>- No, I did not.</b>

24:33.983 --> 24:35.484
<b>- She didn't know.</b>
<b>Y'all, she didn't know.</b>

24:35.518 --> 24:38.754
<b>- And I was like, bitch,</b>
<b>I was not even looking like--</b>

24:38.787 --> 24:42.625
<b>like that at that time,</b>
<b>but I guess I was.</b>

24:42.658 --> 24:44.460
<b>- Kennedy's just like</b>
<b>a grumpy old man.</b>

24:44.493 --> 24:47.263
<b>She's like a grandpa, like</b>
<b>a grandpa who, you know,</b>

24:47.363 --> 24:50.533
<b>can't hear well,</b>
<b>and is just kind of angry,</b>

24:50.566 --> 24:52.034
<b>but is just your grandpa.</b>

24:52.067 --> 24:54.537
<b>It's your grandpa in a wig.</b>

24:54.570 --> 24:56.572
<b>- How do you guys think</b>
<b>I came off on my season?</b>

24:56.605 --> 24:59.608
<b>- I thought you came off</b>
<b>like quirky, friendly, fun.</b>

24:59.642 --> 25:01.043
<b>- That's exactly who I am.</b>

25:01.076 --> 25:04.180
<b>- I did think you were,</b>
<b>like, jealous of Bob.</b>

25:04.213 --> 25:07.383
<b>- I was the first person to say</b>
<b>he is the funniest person alive.</b>

25:07.383 --> 25:08.951
<b>- You were always like,</b>
<b>"It's the Bob show."</b>

25:08.984 --> 25:10.653
<b>- It's the Bob Show.</b>
<b>- You know what I mean?</b>

25:10.686 --> 25:11.821
<b>Yeah.</b>
<b>- Every second.</b>

25:11.854 --> 25:12.888
<b>There was just no room</b>
<b>for anybody else</b>

25:12.922 --> 25:14.390
<b>because his personality</b>
<b>was so big.</b>

25:14.390 --> 25:16.225
<b>That's what I was so, like,</b>
<b>eye roll about, you know?</b>

25:16.258 --> 25:17.226
<b>- Yeah.</b>

25:17.259 --> 25:19.662
<b>- With that said,</b>
<b>I hope he dies.</b>

25:19.695 --> 25:23.032

40:27.530 --> 40:29.065
<b>- You didn't know the words.</b>

40:29.098 --> 40:30.633
<b>If you did,</b>

40:36.604 --> 40:38.206

41:02.130 --> 41:04.298

<b>Thorgy Thor,</b>

41:11.539 --> 41:13.508
<b>Kennedy Davenport.</b>

41:15.243 --> 41:18.579

41:22.583 --> 41:26.487
<b>Aja, Milk, Trixie Mattel,</b>

<b>Please step to</b>
<b>the back of the stage.</b>

41:46.474 --> 41:49.143
<b>- Now it's time for</b>
<b>the Judges' critiques,</b>

41:49.177 --> 41:51.079
<b>starting with Kennedy.</b>

41:51.112 --> 41:52.447
<b>- I liked the runway look.</b>

41:52.480 --> 41:55.583
<b>I loved the covered face,</b>
<b>and then this look, the makeup,</b>

41:55.583 --> 41:58.353
<b>the contact lenses, the white</b>
<b>lip, I think it's really fun.</b>

41:58.386 --> 42:00.321
<b>- But I'm afraid</b>
<b>with your performance,</b>

42:00.355 --> 42:01.856
<b>you didn't know the words.</b>

42:01.889 --> 42:03.891
<b>And if you did,</b>
<b>then you missed them.</b>

42:03.925 --> 42:05.893
<b>And I didn't get any</b>
<b>Janet Jackson,</b>

42:05.927 --> 42:07.595
<b>I got all Kennedy.</b>

42:07.595 --> 42:10.031
<b>- I wasn't getting it in</b>
<b>the moves, I wasn't getting it</b>

42:10.064 --> 42:11.699
<b>in the makeup, I wasn't</b>
<b>getting it in the wig.</b>

42:11.733 --> 42:14.469
<b>- I do know Sean Cheeseman</b>
<b>who did the original "Control"</b>

42:14.502 --> 42:17.605
<b>and "Rhythm Nation," 'cause</b>
<b>he left me to do Janet, so--</b>

42:17.605 --> 42:18.940
<b>[laughing]</b>

42:18.973 --> 42:22.310
<b>- Janet is a very specific kind</b>
<b>of move, very kind of staccato.</b>

42:22.343 --> 42:24.012
<b>You could've worked</b>
<b>a little harder</b>

42:24.045 --> 42:26.614
<b>in terms of making</b>
<b>it really crisp.</b>

42:26.647 --> 42:28.016
<b>- With that being said,</b>
<b>I gave you</b>

42:28.049 --> 42:30.518
<b>the most difficult choreography</b>
<b>out of everybody that was here,</b>

42:30.618 --> 42:32.987
<b>and that should</b>
<b>be accounted for.</b>

42:33.021 --> 42:35.023
<b>- Up next, Chi Chi DeVayne.</b>

42:35.056 --> 42:36.591
<b>- When I first saw</b>
<b>you come out,</b>

42:36.624 --> 42:39.394
<b>I knew instantly that</b>
<b>you were Patti LaBelle.</b>

42:39.427 --> 42:41.896
<b>- Chi Chi, I was sold</b>
<b>on your Patti.</b>

42:41.929 --> 42:44.032
<b>You got the flicks,</b>
<b>which is very Patti.</b>

42:44.065 --> 42:47.168
<b>- And tonight on the runway</b>
<b>you have your neon challenge.</b>

42:47.201 --> 42:49.003
<b>- Mm-hmm.</b>
<b>- Which for you and I, we--</b>

42:49.037 --> 42:51.606
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>- Yes.</b>

42:51.639 --> 42:53.241
<b>And you look</b>
<b>beautiful tonight.</b>

42:53.274 --> 42:54.842
<b>I don't think you need</b>
<b>that coat though.</b>

42:54.876 --> 42:56.310
<b>Yes, girl, look.</b>

42:56.344 --> 42:58.112
<b>We get to see</b>
<b>your shape, beautiful.</b>

42:58.146 --> 42:59.981
<b>- But it's a tiny bit basic.</b>

43:00.014 --> 43:02.016
<b>Like, even with the hair,</b>
<b>the makeup,</b>

43:02.050 --> 43:03.317
<b>like, it just needs</b>
<b>a little tweak.</b>

43:03.351 --> 43:06.354
<b>- Can I just say, I just</b>
<b>loved you in "Eraser".</b>

43:06.387 --> 43:07.588
<b>- Oh, wow.</b>

43:07.588 --> 43:09.757
<b>- Oh, my God.</b>
<b>- Thank you.</b>

43:09.791 --> 43:12.927
<b>- "Eraser", baby.</b>
<b>"Eraser".</b>

43:12.960 --> 43:14.362
<b>- Next up, Shangela.</b>

43:14.395 --> 43:16.631
<b>- I love this look.</b>

43:16.664 --> 43:18.900
<b>The original look was</b>
<b>like Beyonce when she was</b>

43:18.933 --> 43:21.803
<b>in Destiny's Child and sometimes</b>
<b>wore questionable outfits.</b>

43:21.836 --> 43:24.605
<b>And then when she was Beyonce,</b>
<b>that's you right now.</b>

43:24.605 --> 43:25.807
<b>You're slaying.</b>

43:25.840 --> 43:28.843
<b>And I love that you</b>
<b>captured the Mariah</b>

43:28.876 --> 43:31.112
<b>that we know and love,</b>
<b>which is a wonderful</b>

43:31.145 --> 43:34.349
<b>and quizzical blend of</b>
<b>confusion and confidence.</b>

43:34.382 --> 43:36.250
<b>[laughing]</b>

43:36.284 --> 43:39.554
<b>- It's just so awesome to watch</b>
<b>you work from beginning to end.</b>

43:39.587 --> 43:41.589
<b>From the moment you walked out</b>
<b>onto the stage yesterday,</b>

43:41.622 --> 43:43.057
<b>you were in character.</b>

43:43.091 --> 43:45.159
<b>Sometimes a little too</b>
<b>in character,</b>

43:45.193 --> 43:48.229
<b>but I loved the fact that</b>
<b>you owned the role</b>

43:48.262 --> 43:50.298
<b>and elevated the movements</b>
<b>that I gave you.</b>

43:50.331 --> 43:52.200
<b>- This is a full circle moment,</b>

43:52.233 --> 43:55.203
<b>because Vanessa judged</b>
<b>Shangela before.</b>

43:55.236 --> 43:57.138
<b>- Yes, I did, and you've</b>
<b>come a long way</b>

43:57.171 --> 43:59.474
<b>from when I saw you years ago.</b>

43:59.574 --> 44:01.142
<b>You are a superstar.</b>

44:01.175 --> 44:02.443
<b>- Thank you, Ms. Williams.</b>

44:02.477 --> 44:03.911
<b>- Shangela, are you</b>
<b>a Mariah fan?</b>

44:03.945 --> 44:06.581
<b>- I'm a huge Mariah fan,</b>
<b>and I hope when she meets me,</b>

44:06.614 --> 44:07.715
<b>she won't know me.</b>

44:07.749 --> 44:10.785
<b>[laughing]</b>

44:10.818 --> 44:13.221
<b>- Up next, Thorgy Thor.</b>

44:13.254 --> 44:14.922
<b>- Tonight on the runway,</b>
<b>I like this a lot</b>

44:14.956 --> 44:17.692
<b>better than the one</b>
<b>on your season,</b>

44:17.725 --> 44:19.293
<b>but it feels disjointed.</b>

44:19.327 --> 44:21.829
<b>The wedge and the eyebrows</b>
<b>seem like one part,</b>

44:21.863 --> 44:24.132
<b>and the dress feels</b>
<b>like a different part.</b>

44:24.165 --> 44:26.000
<b>And then tonight</b>
<b>the challenge was to embody</b>

44:26.034 --> 44:28.603
<b>and become these diva women.</b>
<b>- Okay.</b>

44:28.603 --> 44:31.506
<b>- And I felt like I was looking</b>
<b>at Thorgy with a blonde wig on.</b>

44:31.606 --> 44:32.740
<b>- Oh.</b>

44:32.774 --> 44:34.208
<b>- Yeah. I got the same thing</b>
<b>that Michelle did.</b>

44:34.242 --> 44:35.677
<b>I think it's about those</b>
<b>visual cues, and you gave us</b>

44:35.710 --> 44:37.245
<b>that with the hat</b>
<b>and the costuming,</b>

44:37.278 --> 44:39.914
<b>but the make-up</b>
<b>wasn't as Stevie.</b>

44:39.947 --> 44:42.550
<b>It's a fine line to still</b>
<b>put yourself in it,</b>

44:42.583 --> 44:44.452
<b>but also make somebody</b>
<b>that does know you</b>

44:44.552 --> 44:45.653
<b>know who you're impersonating.</b>

44:45.687 --> 44:47.321
<b>So that was a miss for me.</b>

44:47.355 --> 44:50.892
<b>- I think Stevie Nicks was a</b>
<b>hard diva to do because it's--</b>

44:50.925 --> 44:52.360
<b>- I'm trying to keep my mouth</b>
<b>shut because I don't--</b>

44:52.393 --> 44:54.595
<b>I don't want</b>
<b>to make any excuses.</b>

44:54.629 --> 44:56.030
<b>- Yeah, it's clearly not what--</b>

44:56.064 --> 44:58.332
<b>- But it's not a gay--</b>
<b>it's not like a gay icon.</b>

44:58.366 --> 45:01.436
<b>- Stevie Nicks is</b>
<b>definitely a gay icon.</b>

45:01.469 --> 45:02.704
<b>- The words came out</b>
<b>of my mouth,</b>

45:02.737 --> 45:04.238
<b>and I was like,</b>
<b>she is to me.</b>

45:04.272 --> 45:06.074
<b>I thought I did a</b>
<b>really good job.</b>

45:06.107 --> 45:07.809
<b>I'm a little surprised</b>
<b>I'm the bottom, to be honest.</b>

45:07.842 --> 45:09.410
<b>- You are all All Stars.</b>

45:09.444 --> 45:13.381
<b>Honestly, we have to pick up</b>
<b>on the slightest infraction</b>

45:13.414 --> 45:17.218
<b>on the challenge,</b>
<b>do you know what I mean?</b>

45:17.251 --> 45:18.653
<b>All right, thanks Thorgy.</b>

45:18.686 --> 45:20.755
<b>Up next, BenDeLaCreme.</b>

45:20.788 --> 45:22.423
<b>Jazz hot.</b>

45:22.457 --> 45:25.193
<b>- I gave you probably the most</b>
<b>difficult challenge because</b>

45:25.226 --> 45:27.862
<b>you had to be Julie Andrews, but</b>
<b>you also had to have swagger,</b>

45:27.895 --> 45:29.197
<b>but then you also</b>
<b>had to know</b>

45:29.230 --> 45:31.165
<b>every single one</b>
<b>of these lyrics.</b>

45:31.199 --> 45:33.401
<b>And I think that you just</b>
<b>knocked it out of the park.</b>

45:33.434 --> 45:36.137
<b>- How do you solve a problem</b>
<b>like "Call Me Mother,"</b>

45:36.170 --> 45:39.273
<b>because I don't even</b>
<b>know the lyrics.</b>

45:39.307 --> 45:42.010
<b>True story. It took me</b>
<b>five days to record that song.</b>

45:42.043 --> 45:43.411
<b>- Really?</b>
<b>- To get the lyrics right?</b>

45:43.444 --> 45:44.779
<b>- Yep.</b>

45:44.812 --> 45:46.948
<b>- And it terms of the outfit,</b>
<b>you're a dream in pink.</b>

45:46.981 --> 45:50.618
<b>Very artistic</b>
<b>in the 1930s, art deco.</b>

45:50.651 --> 45:53.054
<b>- These are actually the</b>
<b>earrings that were given to us</b>

45:53.087 --> 45:55.690
<b>for that challenge</b>
<b>in Season 6.</b>

45:55.723 --> 45:57.091
<b>- I've been looking for those.</b>

45:57.125 --> 45:59.227
<b>[laughing]</b>

45:59.260 --> 46:00.862
<b>- Cameroon!</b>

46:00.895 --> 46:02.296
<b>- Hello, Mother.</b>

46:02.330 --> 46:05.967
<b>- BeBe Zahara Benet, have you</b>
<b>met the first lady of Cameroon?</b>

46:06.000 --> 46:08.336
<b>- I have not met her,</b>
<b>but she's heard of me, honey.</b>

46:08.369 --> 46:10.238
<b>[laughing]</b>

46:10.271 --> 46:14.575
<b>- Baby, you were Diana Ross.</b>
<b>It was amazing to me.</b>

46:14.609 --> 46:15.843
<b>And here's the key</b>
<b>that everybody</b>

46:15.877 --> 46:16.944
<b>should look at for that.</b>

46:16.978 --> 46:19.681
<b>You didn't do much</b>
<b>to embody Diana.</b>

46:19.714 --> 46:21.249
<b>- There wasn't a lot to do.</b>

46:21.282 --> 46:23.184
<b>There weren't a lot of lyrics,</b>
<b>but it was just</b>

46:23.217 --> 46:25.420
<b>a couple of those gestures,</b>
<b>the wardrobe.</b>

46:25.453 --> 46:27.755
<b>- And you even got</b>
<b>the hair bounce, girl.</b>

46:27.789 --> 46:29.490
<b>- It was a real homerun.</b>

46:29.590 --> 46:32.160
<b>- And then with this runway</b>
<b>look, I just love it.</b>

46:32.193 --> 46:34.696
<b>This was like BeBe Priestly,</b>
<b>"Devil Wears Prada,"</b>

46:34.729 --> 46:36.130
<b>the black version.</b>

46:36.164 --> 46:37.932
<b>- Can we just say the black</b>
<b>version of "Devil Wears Prada"</b>

46:37.965 --> 46:41.002
<b>is Wilhelmina Slater?</b>
<b>Hello? Thank you very much.</b>

46:41.035 --> 46:43.571
<b>- Thank you, ladies.</b>

46:43.604 --> 46:47.575
<b>Based on the judges critiques,</b>
<b>I've made some decisions.</b>

46:50.078 --> 46:55.350
<b>Shangela, BenDeLaCreme,</b>

46:55.383 --> 46:56.751
<b>condragulations,</b>

46:56.784 --> 46:58.786
<b>you are the top two</b>
<b>All Stars of the week.</b>

46:58.820 --> 47:01.823
<b>- Yes.</b>

47:01.856 --> 47:07.695
<b>- You've each won a $1,000 gift</b>
<b>card from Sparkles Rhinestones,</b>

47:07.729 --> 47:13.301
<b>and a $1,000 gift card</b>
<b>from Fierce Queen Heels.</b>

47:13.334 --> 47:16.571
<b>BeBe Zahara Benet.</b>
<b>- Yes, Mother.</b>

47:16.604 --> 47:18.039
<b>- Chi Chi DeVayne...</b>

47:19.574 --> 47:21.009
<b>You are safe.</b>

47:22.577 --> 47:25.880
<b>That means, Kennedy Davenport</b>
<b>and Thorgy Thor,</b>

47:25.913 --> 47:29.117
<b>you are in the bottom two.</b>

47:29.150 --> 47:33.855
<b>Shangela, BenDeLa,</b>
<b>each of you needs to decide</b>

47:33.888 --> 47:38.026
<b>which of the bottom queens</b>
<b>you will eliminate</b>

47:38.059 --> 47:41.362
<b>if you win the lip sync.</b>

47:41.396 --> 47:43.798
<b>So while you and the queens</b>
<b>deliberate in the workroom,</b>

47:43.831 --> 47:48.670
<b>the judges and I will play</b>
<b>a friendly game of strip poker.</b>

47:48.703 --> 47:51.005
<b>Thank you, ladies.</b>
<b>You may leave the stage.</b>

47:52.707 --> 47:53.841
<b>Coming up...</b>

47:53.875 --> 47:55.076
<b>- My mind's not made up.</b>

47:55.109 --> 47:57.078
<b>I want to know is Thorgy</b>
<b>going to be</b>

47:57.111 --> 48:00.048
<b>a reliable strong ally for me.</b>

48:00.081 --> 48:02.383
<b>If I throw you a bone,</b>
<b>I'm gonna expect a bone</b>

48:02.417 --> 48:03.618
<b>thrown back to me later on.</b>

48:15.028 --> 48:18.098
<b>- Thorgy and Kennedy, one</b>
<b>of these bitches is going home,</b>

48:18.131 --> 48:22.302
<b>but at this point I'm not</b>
<b>sure how this is gonna go down.</b>

48:22.335 --> 48:25.572
<b>It seems like the girls</b>
<b>all have their own opinion</b>

48:25.605 --> 48:27.540
<b>of how people</b>
<b>should get sent home,</b>

48:27.574 --> 48:31.811
<b>so it's up to DeLa</b>
<b>and Shangela to decide.</b>

48:31.845 --> 48:35.515
<b>- So how is everybody feeling?</b>

48:35.548 --> 48:37.784
<b>- I'm just trying not to cry.</b>
<b>I'm like really holding it in.</b>

48:37.817 --> 48:39.853
<b>Like, it really</b>
<b>doesn't feel good.</b>

48:39.886 --> 48:42.222
<b>I'm like really trying--</b>

48:42.255 --> 48:44.958
<b>- I would be crying right now.</b>
<b>- --to, like, get words out.</b>

48:44.991 --> 48:47.260
<b>Just give me a second.</b>

48:47.293 --> 48:48.762
<b>- Sorry, girl.</b>

48:48.795 --> 48:52.065
<b>- I don't feel like it made</b>
<b>any sense to me, to be honest.</b>

48:52.098 --> 48:53.233
<b>I'm nervous to go home.</b>

48:55.568 --> 48:58.138
<b>I worked really hard</b>
<b>to get here.</b>

48:58.171 --> 48:59.973
<b>- I want to chat with you</b>
<b>if that's okay.</b>

49:00.006 --> 49:01.074
<b>- I'd love to chat with you.</b>

49:01.107 --> 49:03.343
<b>- Should we go chat?</b>
<b>- Yes.</b>

49:03.376 --> 49:05.011
<b>- Wish I could have a refill.</b>

49:05.044 --> 49:06.646
<b>- Yeah, we all need a refill.</b>

49:06.679 --> 49:08.815
<b>I told y'all, "Game of Thrones."</b>

49:08.848 --> 49:11.084
<b>If I'm gonna take over</b>
<b>the Seven Kingdoms, honey,</b>

49:11.117 --> 49:13.086
<b>I'm gonna have to</b>
<b>have some allies.</b>

49:13.119 --> 49:15.688
<b>I want to know, is Thorgy</b>
<b>going to be</b>

49:15.722 --> 49:18.491
<b>a reliable strong ally for me?</b>

49:18.525 --> 49:20.860
<b>- Do I sit here and like beg?</b>
<b>- No.</b>

49:20.894 --> 49:22.095
<b>- Is it even worth it?</b>

49:22.128 --> 49:23.696
<b>- You know, I'm gonna</b>
<b>tell you the truth.</b>

49:23.730 --> 49:24.964
<b>Yes, Kennedy is my friend.</b>

49:24.998 --> 49:26.800
<b>I have known her for</b>
<b>a while, but also--</b>

49:26.833 --> 49:28.201
<b>- I know.</b>
<b>It kind of like terrifies me.</b>

49:28.234 --> 49:30.737
<b>- What I want to say is</b>
<b>that my mind's not made up.</b>

49:30.770 --> 49:32.038
<b>- Okay.</b>

49:32.071 --> 49:34.040
<b>- But she knows as well as I do,</b>
<b>this is a competition.</b>

49:34.073 --> 49:35.842
<b>I respect you.</b>

49:35.875 --> 49:37.777
<b>I know what kind</b>
<b>of a competitor you are,</b>

49:37.811 --> 49:39.379
<b>and you know how I am.</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

49:39.412 --> 49:41.548
<b>- If I throw you a bone,</b>
<b>I'm gonna expect</b>

49:41.581 --> 49:43.149
<b>a bone thrown back</b>
<b>to me later on.</b>

49:43.183 --> 49:44.684
<b>- I've been saying</b>
<b>since day one...</b>

49:47.086 --> 49:48.321
<b>- That's how this game</b>
<b>is played, Mamacita.</b>

49:48.354 --> 49:49.923
<b>- But it's a different game.</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

49:49.956 --> 49:52.192
<b>- If you win and you save me</b>
<b>and you keep me, oh, my God,</b>

49:52.225 --> 49:53.960
<b>I'm like--I want to--</b>
<b>I cannot leave.</b>

49:53.993 --> 49:56.596
<b>I cannot go home.</b>
<b>I am not ready to go home.</b>

49:56.696 --> 50:00.700
<b>- Thorgy. Pros:</b>
<b>she's here to play the game</b>

50:00.700 --> 50:05.305
<b>and she is a fierce,</b>
<b>creative, talented queen.</b>

50:05.338 --> 50:09.175
<b>Cons: it's no secret</b>
<b>that Thorgy sometimes</b>

50:09.209 --> 50:10.643
<b>really gets in her head.</b>

50:10.643 --> 50:12.512
<b>Is that gonna be a handicap</b>
<b>to her</b>

50:12.545 --> 50:14.814
<b>moving forward in</b>
<b>this competition?</b>

50:16.683 --> 50:18.918
<b>- I don't make excuses.</b>

50:18.952 --> 50:20.453
<b>I'm very transparent.</b>

50:20.487 --> 50:26.159
<b>This was a stumbling block, but</b>
<b>I have so much more to give.</b>

50:26.192 --> 50:28.495
<b>I mean, that's my whole focus</b>
<b>of being here is</b>

50:28.528 --> 50:31.498
<b>to let people see through</b>
<b>this and see my heart.</b>

50:31.531 --> 50:35.435
<b>Not so much on stage, because</b>
<b>you can see my heart on stage.</b>

50:35.468 --> 50:36.770
<b>- Right.</b>

50:36.803 --> 50:38.471
<b>- But it's off stage that</b>
<b>I want you to see it.</b>

50:38.505 --> 50:40.006
<b>- I see it, girl.</b>

50:40.039 --> 50:42.909
<b>- Since Season 7,</b>
<b>I think mentally</b>

50:42.942 --> 50:44.677
<b>I've grown to be a better me,</b>

50:44.677 --> 50:47.680
<b>to be a more sickening</b>
<b>and ferocious me, honey.</b>

50:47.714 --> 50:50.483
<b>So leaving is not an option.</b>

50:50.517 --> 50:52.986
<b>So don't tell me nothing,</b>
<b>you know.</b>

50:53.019 --> 50:55.421
<b>You make your decision based</b>
<b>on what you have seen,</b>

50:55.455 --> 50:57.690
<b>but, I mean,</b>
<b>I don't want to go home.</b>

50:57.724 --> 51:00.760
<b>- When I look at the full scope</b>
<b>of who's here, I can see</b>

51:00.794 --> 51:03.463
<b>Kennedy in that final three,</b>
<b>but the biggest thing</b>

51:03.496 --> 51:05.165
<b>working against Kennedy</b>
<b>is that,</b>

51:05.198 --> 51:07.867
<b>yes, she had some</b>
<b>intense choreography,</b>

51:07.901 --> 51:10.170
<b>but what I heard</b>
<b>from the judges</b>

51:10.203 --> 51:13.740
<b>was she didn't fully</b>
<b>embody Janet</b>

51:13.773 --> 51:17.377
<b>and she was a huge part</b>
<b>of this challenge.</b>

51:17.410 --> 51:18.778
<b>- You seemed like you</b>
<b>really thought</b>

51:18.812 --> 51:19.846
<b>you were gonna be in the top.</b>

51:21.714 --> 51:26.453
<b>- I was in character</b>
<b>the entire time, and...</b>

51:26.486 --> 51:30.990
<b>to be standing on</b>
<b>that stage and not--</b>

51:31.024 --> 51:33.660
<b>not be commended for it...</b>

51:38.131 --> 51:40.433
<b>- I think that's a lot</b>
<b>of emotion for safe.</b>

51:40.467 --> 51:42.735
<b>- It's stupid.</b>

51:42.769 --> 51:44.304
<b>- Girl, do you want Celine</b>
<b>to come over here</b>

51:44.337 --> 51:45.672
<b>and sing you a song?</b>

51:47.340 --> 51:48.441
<b>Girl.</b>

51:48.475 --> 51:50.844
<b>- I was in eight of</b>
<b>the ten numbers,</b>

51:50.877 --> 51:53.179
<b>and I did the goddamn thing.</b>

51:53.213 --> 51:56.516
<b>When I know I did a really</b>
<b>great job, call me selfish,</b>

51:56.549 --> 51:58.785
<b>but I want--</b>
<b>I want to hear it.</b>

51:58.818 --> 52:00.787
<b>I was so excited</b>
<b>to get up there</b>

52:00.820 --> 52:04.457
<b>and hear what they thought</b>
<b>of my performance,</b>

52:04.491 --> 52:07.894
<b>and what they thought of</b>
<b>my Ru-demption look</b>

52:07.927 --> 52:12.132
<b>because in Season 6 all</b>
<b>they wanted to see was glamour.</b>

52:12.165 --> 52:14.067
<b>- I feel like you've been</b>
<b>giving a lot of glamour.</b>

52:14.100 --> 52:16.636
<b>- I--I can assume that</b>
<b>that's what they think,</b>

52:16.669 --> 52:18.938
<b>but I want them</b>
<b>to congratulate me.</b>

52:20.974 --> 52:23.076
<b>- Milk's perception of</b>
<b>his performance</b>

52:23.109 --> 52:24.711
<b>is obviously different</b>
<b>than the reality.</b>

52:24.744 --> 52:26.713
<b>Her Ru-demption Runway</b>
<b>was something</b>

52:26.746 --> 52:29.883
<b>that didn't really reflect</b>
<b>why we like Milk.</b>

52:29.916 --> 52:32.152
<b>It was like a safe,</b>
<b>pretty choice.</b>

52:32.185 --> 52:34.854
<b>Plus the Celine look</b>
<b>was not very Celine.</b>

52:37.791 --> 52:40.360
<b>- Do you have an idea of like</b>
<b>why I should choose you</b>

52:40.393 --> 52:41.761
<b>and Kennedy, you</b>
<b>know what I mean?</b>

52:41.795 --> 52:43.463
<b>Because right now</b>
<b>I'm just like, I don't know.</b>

52:43.496 --> 52:44.731
<b>- Here it is.</b>

52:44.764 --> 52:46.266
<b>When you win this lip sync</b>
<b>and you save me,</b>

52:46.299 --> 52:47.934
<b>I'll owe you one.</b>

52:47.967 --> 52:49.102
<b>Can I ask you an</b>
<b>honest question?</b>

52:49.135 --> 52:50.303
<b>- Yeah.</b>

52:50.336 --> 52:51.471
<b>- Do you think I should be</b>
<b>in the bottom two?</b>

52:51.504 --> 52:53.673
<b>- Uh, I--</b>

52:53.673 --> 52:55.909
<b>- I actually thought</b>
<b>I did a great job.</b>

52:55.942 --> 52:58.311
<b>- I was--I didn't see anybody,</b>
<b>you know what I mean?</b>

52:58.344 --> 52:59.679
<b>- Yeah, yeah.</b>

52:59.679 --> 53:00.980
<b>I just have so many thoughts</b>
<b>going through my head.</b>

53:01.014 --> 53:03.683
<b>Like, when you're given</b>
<b>Diana Ross and, like,</b>

53:03.683 --> 53:06.252
<b>every comment is like,</b>
<b>"It's Diana Ross, so..."</b>

53:06.286 --> 53:07.987
<b>- Yeah.</b>

53:08.021 --> 53:10.223
<b>- "You did less and</b>
<b>that was so much more."</b>

53:10.256 --> 53:12.425
<b>I'm like, to me that means</b>
<b>you did nothing.</b>

53:12.459 --> 53:15.628
<b>You just--it's Diana Ross.</b>

53:15.628 --> 53:19.065
<b>I don't know, but that's why</b>
<b>in the rehearsal I was like,</b>

53:19.099 --> 53:20.633
<b>use me more.</b>

53:20.633 --> 53:22.435
<b>- I know that Thorgy feels</b>
<b>like she was focused</b>

53:22.469 --> 53:25.772
<b>in the rehearsal process,</b>
<b>but she'd be like in the back,</b>

53:25.805 --> 53:28.108
<b>like, frustrated because she</b>
<b>feels like she's being derailed.</b>

53:28.141 --> 53:30.844
<b>It was like a weird subconscious</b>
<b>thing happening, I think.</b>

53:30.877 --> 53:33.646
<b>- I'd like to say no matter</b>
<b>who you choose on that runway,</b>

53:33.646 --> 53:36.282
<b>like, I love you,</b>

53:36.316 --> 53:38.151
<b>but I can't predict</b>
<b>the way I'm gonna react.</b>

53:39.819 --> 53:42.789
<b>I--I would not feel</b>
<b>right going home.</b>

53:42.822 --> 53:44.357
<b>- I actually really love</b>

53:44.390 --> 53:46.493
<b>what Thorgy has to offer</b>
<b>as a drag queen.</b>

53:46.526 --> 53:49.662
<b>I think she's a total weirdo</b>
<b>in a way that I love,</b>

53:49.662 --> 53:52.899
<b>but Thorgy gets upset</b>
<b>fairly easily.</b>

53:52.932 --> 53:57.804
<b>I'm worried that she would</b>
<b>get in her own way eventually.</b>

53:57.837 --> 54:00.673
<b>- So here's the tea.</b>
<b>You know we can talk real.</b>

54:00.673 --> 54:03.109
<b>When I talk to Kennedy,</b>
<b>I want to make sure</b>

54:03.143 --> 54:05.278
<b>that her heart is still</b>
<b>in this competition</b>

54:05.311 --> 54:06.679
<b>because she's gotta be</b>
<b>in that top</b>

54:06.679 --> 54:10.083
<b>or else I would've</b>
<b>just wasted a save.</b>

54:10.116 --> 54:13.052
<b>If I win, why don't I have</b>
<b>your name in my hand?</b>

54:13.086 --> 54:14.621
<b>- You know in your heart--</b>
<b>- Mm-hmm.</b>

54:14.654 --> 54:16.756
<b>- --where my dedication was.</b>

54:16.790 --> 54:19.459
<b>I put a lot into this.</b>

54:19.492 --> 54:21.361
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>- And I--</b>

54:21.394 --> 54:23.329
<b>- Oh, I saw you stoning</b>
<b>that wig for hours.</b>

54:23.363 --> 54:25.999
<b>- I wouldn't have</b>
<b>did this Season 7.</b>

54:26.032 --> 54:28.635
<b>That's why I feel like</b>
<b>I belong here,</b>

54:28.635 --> 54:32.038
<b>because I have so much to give</b>
<b>and so much to present.</b>

54:32.071 --> 54:33.706
<b>- Let me ask you this.</b>

54:33.740 --> 54:37.510
<b>If given the opportunity, would</b>
<b>you send me to the house?</b>

54:37.544 --> 54:40.747
<b>- There's certain boundaries</b>
<b>that you just do not cross.</b>

54:40.780 --> 54:44.951
<b>$100,000 is not worth</b>
<b>losing a relationship.</b>

54:44.984 --> 54:46.486
<b>It's just not.</b>

54:46.519 --> 54:48.321
<b>And that's the type</b>
<b>of person that I am.</b>

54:48.354 --> 54:50.457
<b>- There's a lot to think about.</b>

54:50.490 --> 54:53.059
<b>Right now I'm feeling torn.</b>

54:53.093 --> 54:55.829
<b>When you base decisions</b>
<b>just on your friendships,</b>

54:55.862 --> 54:58.832
<b>then you make decisions that</b>
<b>you might end up regretting.</b>

55:01.367 --> 55:04.871
<b>- I'll raise you 20.</b>
<b>- I'm in.</b>

55:04.904 --> 55:06.172
<b>- I've got four queens.</b>

55:06.206 --> 55:07.440
<b>[laughs]</b>

55:07.474 --> 55:09.776
<b>- I hate this game.</b>

55:11.444 --> 55:13.880
<b>These have always</b>
<b>brought me luck.</b>

55:13.913 --> 55:15.315
<b>- I'll take them.</b>

55:15.348 --> 55:16.649
<b>- Just your size.</b>

55:16.683 --> 55:17.984
<b>- Silence.</b>

55:18.017 --> 55:19.886
<b>Bring back my girls.</b>

55:21.421 --> 55:23.123
<b>[laughing]</b>

55:27.026 --> 55:29.028
<b>- This is not</b>
<b>an easy decision.</b>

55:29.062 --> 55:33.199
<b>Each of these queens has</b>
<b>a lot more to offer,</b>

55:33.233 --> 55:35.869
<b>but they both had</b>
<b>trouble delivering</b>

55:35.902 --> 55:37.704
<b>what the judges</b>
<b>needed from them.</b>

55:37.737 --> 55:41.508
<b>So I genuinely have no idea</b>
<b>what to do here.</b>

55:44.911 --> 55:48.848
<b>- I made a decision, but am</b>
<b>I making the right choice?</b>

55:48.882 --> 55:52.385
<b>Is this queen going to push</b>
<b>herself to be in the top,</b>

55:52.418 --> 55:55.088
<b>and when she's there,</b>
<b>can I count on her?</b>

56:04.296 --> 56:06.364
<b>- Welcome back, ladies.</b>

56:06.398 --> 56:09.434
<b>Two top All Stars</b>
<b>stand before me.</b>

56:09.467 --> 56:12.337
<b>Prior to tonight,</b>
<b>you were asked to prepare</b>

56:12.370 --> 56:16.741
<b>a lip sync performance of "Jump"</b>
<b>by the Pointer Sisters.</b>

56:16.775 --> 56:21.947
<b>This your chance to impress me,</b>
<b>win $10,000,</b>

56:21.980 --> 56:27.819
<b>and earn the power to give one</b>
<b>of the bottom queens the chop.</b>

56:29.721 --> 56:32.224
<b>The time has come...</b>
<b>[thunder]</b>

56:32.257 --> 56:37.329
<b>to lip sync for your legacy.</b>

56:37.362 --> 56:40.198
<b>- Now BenDeLa, she's won</b>
<b>two challenges at this point.</b>

56:40.232 --> 56:42.500
<b>She's a sneaky ho, okay?</b>

56:42.534 --> 56:45.170
<b>She ain't taking my $10,000.</b>
<b>No, ma'am.</b>

56:45.203 --> 56:50.175
<b>- Good luck,</b>
<b>and don't [bleep] it up.</b>

<b>Shangela, you're</b>

59:00.572 --> 59:03.008

<b>Shangela, with great power</b>

<b>Which queen have you chosen</b>
<b>to get the chop?</b>

59:34.773 --> 59:36.908
<b>- I know what it's like to</b>
<b>come back to this competition</b>

59:36.942 --> 59:40.645
<b>and be sent home again</b>
<b>without getting the crown.</b>

59:40.679 --> 59:43.215
<b>I know how that feels.</b>

<b>The person I've chosen</b>

59:47.252 --> 59:48.520
<b>is Thorgy.</b>

<b>I love you guys.</b>

<b>I really mean that.</b>
<b>I really do love you.</b>

<b>Whoo!</b>

1:00:16.481 --> 1:00:18.383
<b>I am not ready to leave</b>
<b>this competition at all.</b>

1:00:18.416 --> 1:00:20.485
<b>I have so much to give.</b>

1:00:20.518 --> 1:00:22.587
<b>In comparison to some of</b>
<b>the other girls here,</b>

1:00:22.621 --> 1:00:24.389
<b>I think I deserve to stay</b>
<b>a lot more.</b>

1:00:24.422 --> 1:00:28.159
<b>"Drag is fun," and then because</b>
<b>I'm gonna hate Shangela</b>

1:00:28.193 --> 1:00:31.763
<b>for life, how about</b>
<b>"Suck it Shangella,"</b>

1:00:31.796 --> 1:00:36.234
<b>and I'm gonna spell it with</b>
<b>two Ls because she hates that,</b>

1:00:36.268 --> 1:00:40.071
<b>and then she can [bleep] this,</b>

1:00:40.105 --> 1:00:42.974
<b>'cause it's going that way.</b>

1:00:43.008 --> 1:00:44.643
<b>Yeah, that's pretty disgusting.</b>

1:00:44.676 --> 1:00:46.011
<b>Have a good time without me.</b>

1:00:46.044 --> 1:00:47.345
<b>Bye.</b>
<b>It's gonna be boring TV.</b>

1:00:47.379 --> 1:00:49.981
<b>[bell ringing]</b>
<b>I don't know what that means.</b>

1:00:52.551 --> 1:00:55.587
<b>- Under his eye, kitty girl.</b>
<b>- Jesus Christmas.</b>

1:00:55.620 --> 1:00:57.822
<b>- Today you've been</b>
<b>given a gift.</b>

1:00:57.856 --> 1:01:00.559
<b>Well, it's actually</b>
<b>more like a Groupon.</b>

1:01:03.628 --> 1:01:05.063
<b>- What the hell is going on?</b>

1:01:07.032 --> 1:01:10.302
<b>Is this gonna explode?</b>

1:01:10.335 --> 1:01:12.437
<b>Please don't explode.</b>

1:01:46.833 --> 1:01:48.568
<b>- [RuPaul]</b>
<b>Next time on "All Stars"...</b>

1:01:48.602 --> 1:01:49.336
<b>You'll be improving your</b>
<b>way through The Bitchelor.</b>
