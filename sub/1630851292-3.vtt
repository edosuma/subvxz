00:41.283 --> 00:43.709
(in Marge voice):
Happy Halloween, kids!

00:43.860 --> 00:45.377
Happy Halloween!

00:45.529 --> 00:47.771
Look, it's Matt Foley
from<i> Saturday Night Live.</i>

00:47.790 --> 00:50.774
I don't know who that is. I just
came from a meeting at work.

00:50.867 --> 00:52.109
Oh, good. Peter, you're home.

00:52.127 --> 00:53.627
You can help me pass out candy.

00:53.779 --> 00:56.129
Sorry, Lois, I have
to go do a dangerous speedball

00:56.223 --> 00:59.616
and become the least surprising
death in Hollywood history.

00:59.709 --> 01:02.302
(groans)

01:02.396 --> 01:04.788
(laughter)

01:04.881 --> 01:07.382
Happy Halloween, Meg.

01:07.401 --> 01:10.402
Wow, Mayor West.
That's some costume.

01:10.629 --> 01:12.312
Well, thank you kindly.

01:12.464 --> 01:14.631
(imitating Borat):
It-a me, Borat.

01:14.724 --> 01:16.633
You know, from that picture
<i> Borat.</i>

01:16.726 --> 01:18.243
You ever seen it?

01:18.395 --> 01:20.654
Yeah, that movie came out,
like, 15 years ago.

01:20.806 --> 01:22.472
Well, I'd never heard of it,

01:22.491 --> 01:25.267
but it was just about the
funniest thing I'd ever seen.

01:25.327 --> 01:27.235
Anyway, have a good evening.

01:27.329 --> 01:29.571
(imitating Borat):
My wife.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.982
(laughter)

01:32.000 --> 01:33.500
(crickets chirping)

01:33.652 --> 01:34.909
"This is my costume"?

01:35.003 --> 01:36.578
Come on, put in some effort.

01:36.597 --> 01:39.323
Guys, just 'cause you showed up,
doesn't mean you get an apple.

01:39.416 --> 01:41.491
-Apple.
-We're here for candy!

01:41.585 --> 01:43.102
Kill yourself!

01:43.253 --> 01:44.937
There's a lot of sugar
in an apple!

01:45.088 --> 01:46.939
If you saw the numbers,
you'd be shocked!

01:47.166 --> 01:48.515
Trick or treat!

01:48.609 --> 01:51.926
Wow, that's the first<i> Frozen</i>
I've seen in 35 seconds.

01:51.946 --> 01:54.004
Oh, my God,
I love your pilot costume.

01:54.097 --> 01:56.356
Thank you. I'm actually
John Travolta walking

01:56.450 --> 01:58.283
into my backyard airport
in Florida

01:58.435 --> 02:00.285
to fly a passenger jet
all by myself.

02:00.437 --> 02:02.696
That's right,
I'm just a regular guy.

02:02.790 --> 02:04.105
Your daughter is adorable.

02:04.199 --> 02:06.107
Oh, she's not my daughter.
She's my niece.

02:06.201 --> 02:08.018
My sister and her husband
ran into someone

02:08.111 --> 02:10.945
having an adult Halloween party
and didn't have an excuse ready.

02:10.965 --> 02:12.113
Oh, I'm so sorry.

02:12.207 --> 02:13.874
Yeah, it was really tough
for them,

02:13.968 --> 02:15.968
but I said earlier,
"I'm not gonna cry,"

02:16.195 --> 02:18.195
so I'm not gonna cry.

02:18.288 --> 02:20.213
And hi. My name's Carrie.

02:20.307 --> 02:22.290
Hi, Carrie. My name is Glenn.

02:22.384 --> 02:24.292
It's really nice talking
to you, Glenn.

02:24.386 --> 02:27.479
-You, too, Carrie.
-Hey! Candy!

02:27.589 --> 02:29.706
STEWIE:
Hey, Brian, check it out!

02:29.725 --> 02:31.466
(grunting)

02:31.485 --> 02:34.820
This might be my biggest
candy score ever.

02:35.047 --> 02:36.822
Probably thanks
to my killer costume.

02:37.049 --> 02:38.231
What are you dressed as?

02:38.384 --> 02:41.076
I'm the "Oh, my God"
reaction GIF.

02:44.907 --> 02:46.056
And people get that?

02:46.149 --> 02:47.666
Yeah.
Everyone's dressed as GIFs.

02:47.893 --> 02:49.001
Ain't that right, Pop?

02:56.493 --> 02:58.402
Wow. This place is great, Glenn.

02:58.420 --> 03:00.345
Yeah, they can really
microwave eggs here.

03:00.497 --> 03:02.681
You know, I'm so glad you
trick-or-treated at my house.

03:02.908 --> 03:04.241
I finally found someone

03:04.259 --> 03:06.668
I can just say names
from<i> Succession</i> with.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.470
I mean, oh, my God, Kendall?

03:08.580 --> 03:11.190
-Kendall! And Shiv?
-Love Shiv.

03:11.417 --> 03:13.841
-And what about Roman?
-Yes!

03:13.936 --> 03:15.419
And Logan.

03:15.437 --> 03:17.178
-Oh, Logan.
-(dog whines)

03:17.272 --> 03:18.513
Oh, look at that dog.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.515
Yeah, who brings a dog
to a coffee shop?

03:20.534 --> 03:23.260
-I love dogs.
-Without letting me pet it.

03:23.278 --> 03:25.537
Come here, you... dog.

03:25.764 --> 03:27.689
Oh, isn't he so sweet?

03:27.708 --> 03:29.449
Oh, good boy.

03:29.601 --> 03:31.435
Yay, my hand smells
like you now.

03:31.528 --> 03:34.454
Oh, I'm so happy
you're a dog person.

03:34.606 --> 03:36.122
I don't think
I could be with someone

03:36.217 --> 03:38.050
who doesn't love dogs
as much as I do.

03:38.201 --> 03:39.443
Yeah, it's great
we like the same things

03:39.536 --> 03:40.961
as soon as you say
what you like.

03:41.113 --> 03:42.870
So, what kind
of dog do you have?

03:42.965 --> 03:45.115
Well, uh, uh,
what kind of dog?

03:45.133 --> 03:47.041
Um... you know,
I-I've never noticed.

03:47.061 --> 03:49.210
I... I'm... I'm more attracted
to his spirit.

03:49.230 --> 03:50.878
Oh, they're so special.

03:50.973 --> 03:52.472
And you know
what's right around the corner?

03:52.624 --> 03:54.566
The strip club where they spit
in your face?

03:54.793 --> 03:56.309
No, the dog park!

03:56.462 --> 03:58.478
For our next date,
we should bring our dogs there.

03:58.630 --> 04:00.239
Next date? Absolutely.

04:00.466 --> 04:02.890
-Oh, and cousin Greg!
-Cousin Greg!

04:02.985 --> 04:05.452
Cousin Greg.

04:09.308 --> 04:11.157
Phew,
that tummy time was killer.

04:11.310 --> 04:12.918
Totally blasted my core.

04:13.069 --> 04:14.828
But I think that earns me
a little treat.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.588
What the deuce?

04:16.740 --> 04:18.315
This bag was full last night,

04:18.333 --> 04:19.816
and now half of it's gone.

04:19.835 --> 04:21.760
Oh, my God, I've been robbed!

04:26.658 --> 04:28.934
Rupert, check the jewelry box,
see if anything's missing.

04:29.161 --> 04:31.011
"An engagement ring"?

04:31.163 --> 04:32.662
Oh, ha-ha, very funny,
but not the time

04:32.681 --> 04:35.065
to have this conversation--
we've been burgled!

04:36.668 --> 04:39.669
Well, looks like they only stole
some of my Halloween candy.

04:39.763 --> 04:41.262
But they're not going
to get away with this.

04:41.282 --> 04:43.431
Like the fat man
when he plays Clue.

04:43.525 --> 04:45.509
Okay, the murderer
was "don't care,"

04:45.602 --> 04:47.010
with a "this game sucks"

04:47.029 --> 04:48.936
in the "I regret
having children."

04:48.956 --> 04:51.773
<i> ANNOUNCER:</i>
<i> Clue-- you got someone</i>
<i> pregnant nine years ago,</i>

04:51.867 --> 04:54.293
<i> so now you have to play this.</i>

04:58.465 --> 05:00.540
Thanks for coming
with me, Peter.

05:00.634 --> 05:01.875
I need a dog for my date,

05:02.027 --> 05:03.242
but I don't know
the first thing about 'em.

05:03.395 --> 05:05.195
No problem, Quagmire.
But just know

05:05.288 --> 05:06.805
I'm gonna spend
most of the time here

05:07.032 --> 05:09.366
finding the courage
to hold an iguana.

05:09.384 --> 05:10.475
Here he is.

05:10.627 --> 05:12.144
I'm not sure I'm ready!

05:13.388 --> 05:14.313
(barking)

05:14.540 --> 05:16.206
Uh, excuse me,
how much is that one?

05:16.299 --> 05:18.132
Oh, he's a purebred
Bichon Frise,

05:18.152 --> 05:20.301
so he's $1,500.

05:20.321 --> 05:23.046
For a dog?! Um, and-and what's
your return policy?

05:23.139 --> 05:25.231
Is it, like, full money back
within ten days?

05:25.326 --> 05:27.475
Sir, if you're not interested,
I have to comb feces

05:27.494 --> 05:29.886
out of the guinea pigs' hair
with a wet paper towel.

05:29.979 --> 05:32.331
Go ahead, you can touch him.

05:32.482 --> 05:33.890
(gasps)

05:33.983 --> 05:35.584
It's dry.

05:39.155 --> 05:40.897
Sorry we couldn't get you a dog.

05:40.916 --> 05:43.083
Come on in, we'll have
however many beers it takes

05:43.235 --> 05:45.235
to forget how depressing
the shelter was.

05:45.253 --> 05:48.680
I'll go get
those aforementioned beers.

05:48.907 --> 05:51.016
Thanks, word-a-day calendar.

05:53.745 --> 05:55.854
Oh, hey, Quagmire.

05:56.005 --> 05:57.522
Mm.

05:57.749 --> 05:59.024
I mean, mmm, there he is!

05:59.175 --> 06:01.267
Brian the dog!

06:01.362 --> 06:03.420
What's going on here?
Why are you using my full name?

06:03.513 --> 06:05.422
All right,
let's cut to the chase.

06:05.440 --> 06:06.773
I like chases.

06:06.925 --> 06:08.425
Okay, look,
I'm seeing this woman,

06:08.518 --> 06:10.202
and there's something
different about her.

06:10.429 --> 06:12.854
I mean, it's not just that
the sex is great, which it is,

06:12.948 --> 06:14.781
but I appreciate her
as a person,

06:14.933 --> 06:17.358
which sounds kind of weird
coming out of my mouth.

06:17.378 --> 06:19.861
Anyway, I told her
I have a dog, so...

06:19.880 --> 06:21.938
would you pretend to be my dog?

06:22.031 --> 06:24.441
(laughing)

06:24.459 --> 06:27.260
Well, well, well.

06:28.130 --> 06:30.722
Well, well, well.

06:30.874 --> 06:34.300
Well, well,
well.

06:34.395 --> 06:36.286
Brian, come on, I'm serious.
Will you help me out?

06:36.379 --> 06:38.121
Glenn Quagmire,
there are not enough

06:38.140 --> 06:39.564
tennis balls
in the world for me to--

06:39.791 --> 06:41.233
-I have six.
-I'll do it.

06:47.132 --> 06:49.241
(dogs barking, howling)

06:50.727 --> 06:52.226
Thanks for doing this, Brian.

06:52.246 --> 06:53.745
And remember,
just act like a normal,

06:53.897 --> 06:55.655
well-behaved, non-talking dog.

06:55.807 --> 06:57.974
-Non-talking?
-Yeah, just bark and stuff.

06:57.993 --> 06:59.993
Bark? Geez, it's been a while.

07:00.145 --> 07:01.478
Let me give it a try.

07:01.496 --> 07:02.587
Brack.

07:02.739 --> 07:04.330
"Brack"?
What the hell is that?

07:04.483 --> 07:05.982
-I'm finding it.
-Damn it, Brian!

07:06.001 --> 07:07.074
I knew you were gonna
screw this up for me.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.668
I thought you wanted to help.

07:08.820 --> 07:10.929
"Help"? I'm not doing this
because I want to help.

07:11.156 --> 07:13.006
I'm only doing this
so I can have a front-row seat

07:13.100 --> 07:14.507
when you crash and burn.

07:14.660 --> 07:16.493
Okay, first of all,
it's incredibly insensitive

07:16.511 --> 07:18.603
to say "crash and burn"
to a pilot.

07:18.755 --> 07:20.087
And, second, how dare you?

07:20.107 --> 07:22.107
How dare you, Brian the dog?

07:22.334 --> 07:24.258
You know I'm right-- you're
gonna get tired of the sex,

07:24.278 --> 07:25.777
and then you'll move
on to the next one.

07:25.929 --> 07:27.170
Oh, 'cause you know
everything, right?

07:27.263 --> 07:28.505
Well, you're wrong, Brian.

07:28.523 --> 07:30.006
Okay, shut up, here she comes.

07:30.099 --> 07:32.358
Hi, Glenn. This is Dexter.

07:32.511 --> 07:34.844
Aw, and who's this little guy?

07:34.863 --> 07:37.772
Uh, uh, this is... Harvey.

07:37.866 --> 07:39.624
Named after Weinstein, uh...

07:39.851 --> 07:42.944
'C-Cause you can see his balls
when he answers the door.

07:42.963 --> 07:45.446
I may be dating myself,
but in the '90s,

07:45.540 --> 07:47.782
the funniest thing you could do
was show people your balls.

07:47.801 --> 07:50.117
C-Can you start
talking now, please?

07:50.212 --> 07:51.786
Sorry, I couldn't hear you

07:51.805 --> 07:53.379
'cause my dog was licking
my ear.

07:53.532 --> 07:55.715
Oh, thank God.
This is my dog, Bob...

07:55.809 --> 07:57.217
Weinstein.

07:57.311 --> 07:58.459
He's man's best friend

07:58.479 --> 08:00.053
because he's very good
at keeping quiet.

08:00.205 --> 08:02.555
Do you mind if I take
five minutes in the parking lot?

08:02.649 --> 08:05.275
This is Spot.

08:09.564 --> 08:11.397
All right, Rupert,
when the thief comes back

08:11.492 --> 08:12.716
for the rest of my candy,

08:12.734 --> 08:15.118
he'll have to deal
with my latest invention.

08:16.071 --> 08:17.721
Hey, Stewie, what are you d--

08:17.739 --> 08:20.056
(exclaims)
Aah! Help! Somebody help me!

08:20.149 --> 08:22.408
I won't survive on the inside!

08:22.503 --> 08:24.669
(grunts)
Thief! I've caught you!

08:24.896 --> 08:26.654
Chris?

08:26.673 --> 08:27.989
Stewie, get off.

08:28.083 --> 08:29.674
I haven't been
stealing your candy.

08:29.901 --> 08:31.676
-Dad has.
-The fat man?

08:31.828 --> 08:34.571
He did the same thing to me
when I was younger.

08:34.589 --> 08:36.998
The only way to keep him
away from it is to hide it.

08:37.092 --> 08:38.517
And that's why I'm here.

08:38.744 --> 08:40.001
I'm gonna help you.

08:40.095 --> 08:42.336
Really? You'd do that for me?

08:42.356 --> 08:44.247
Of course, Stewie. We're family.

08:44.266 --> 08:46.082
We look out for each other,

08:46.175 --> 08:47.600
like the people on<i> Succession.</i>

08:47.694 --> 08:50.695
Well, don't leave me hanging
like that-- throw out a name!

08:50.922 --> 08:52.939
-Tom.
-Oh, Tom!

08:53.091 --> 08:55.283
Can you believe Tom?

08:57.871 --> 09:00.354
Carrie's gonna be here soon.
Can you give me a hand getting

09:00.374 --> 09:03.190
-this cat stuff out of here?
-Where is your cat, anyway?

09:03.285 --> 09:05.268
I don't know. No cat owner
knows where their cat is.

09:05.361 --> 09:06.878
Okay, but I still don't know why

09:07.105 --> 09:08.454
you're going through
all this trouble.

09:08.607 --> 09:10.215
I mean, you're just gonna bail
and leave her in the dust.

09:10.442 --> 09:12.776
-Hey, how's your son, Brian?
-Whoa!

09:12.794 --> 09:15.387
What happened to DEFCON four,
three, and two?

09:15.538 --> 09:16.613
-(doorbell rings)
-Okay, she's here.

09:16.631 --> 09:18.598
Get off the couch.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.060
-Who is it?
-It's<i> The Purge.</i>

09:22.287 --> 09:24.304
-We're here to beat you up.
-(laughs)

09:24.398 --> 09:25.972
(smooching)

09:26.066 --> 09:29.401
Coming up, one pizza
with alternative crust.

09:29.552 --> 09:31.236
Oh! Yummy, yummy!

09:31.387 --> 09:34.147
Alternative crust pizza is
really good, Brian.

09:34.299 --> 09:36.074
You can't taste the difference.

09:36.225 --> 09:37.892
What aren't you lying
to yourself about?

09:37.986 --> 09:39.578
Okay, you want
to know the truth, Brian?

09:39.729 --> 09:41.471
Brian the dog? I love her.

09:41.489 --> 09:43.290
You hear me? Love.

09:44.567 --> 09:45.750
This is priceless.

09:45.902 --> 09:46.993
I haven't had this much fun

09:47.087 --> 09:48.712
since I went to that graveyard.

09:50.573 --> 09:52.816
-Yeah, how do you like
how this sounds, huh?
-(urine trickling)

09:52.834 --> 09:56.094
Try cleaning up this mess
while you burn in hell!

09:56.321 --> 09:58.263
-Peter, you ready to go?
-Almost!

09:58.414 --> 10:00.673
-What do you mean
you don't like that?
-(urine trickling)

10:00.826 --> 10:03.184
Just try it, maybe you will!

10:06.164 --> 10:08.106
Thanks again
for having us over, Lois.

10:08.257 --> 10:09.682
Everything was so delicious.

10:09.776 --> 10:11.684
Oh, my pleasure, Carrie.

10:11.778 --> 10:13.353
Yeah, I've got to say, Glenn,

10:13.447 --> 10:15.596
I've never seen you
this happy before.

10:15.616 --> 10:18.024
Well, then you've never
seen me at my best before.

10:18.176 --> 10:20.285
And it's all thanks to Carrie.

10:21.363 --> 10:23.529
Aw, not at the dinner table.

10:23.624 --> 10:25.940
I'm sorry, Peter,
I just can't help myself.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.608
I'm crazy about this woman.

10:27.702 --> 10:29.669
(phone buzzing)

10:31.857 --> 10:33.781
Huh?

10:33.800 --> 10:36.676
(panting)

10:41.700 --> 10:44.050
-"Will you marry me?"
-What's this now?

10:44.202 --> 10:47.479
Oh, my God, Glenn, yes!
Yes, of course I'll marry you!

10:47.630 --> 10:49.372
Mmm...

10:49.391 --> 10:50.315
Mazel tov!

10:50.542 --> 10:52.466
"Mazel tov"?
Where did that come from?

10:52.486 --> 10:56.470
From Marvelous Mrs. Mazel Tov.
Y-you should know that, Lois.

10:56.564 --> 10:58.031
Mmm.

11:01.477 --> 11:03.644
Engaged?!

11:03.664 --> 11:06.906
Aw, come on, Quagmire,
you're killing me, man.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.558
Babe, babe, please--
Babe, please stop crying.

11:08.651 --> 11:11.336
Look, every couple needs to
take things at their own speed.

11:11.563 --> 11:13.838
It doesn't mean
I love you any less.

11:13.990 --> 11:16.900
Okay, look-- how about
we look at rings this weekend?

11:16.918 --> 11:18.918
I-I don't know.
Zales, probably?

11:19.070 --> 11:21.754
Well, that's what we can afford
since only one of us has a job!

11:21.848 --> 11:23.089
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11:23.241 --> 11:24.665
Ugh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

11:24.685 --> 11:25.925
(sighs)

11:26.019 --> 11:27.852
"Why don't you join me
for dinner?" he said,

11:28.004 --> 11:29.145
ruining his life.

11:35.011 --> 11:37.437
(humming)

11:37.589 --> 11:40.423
There he is,
the bridegroom to be.

11:40.516 --> 11:43.517
That's right, the very happy
bridegroom to be,

11:43.537 --> 11:45.778

Who are we waiting for, Chris?

13:14.443 --> 13:15.943
I called in some professionals.

you're off on a little trip.

They're now saying
kids through eight

13:50.497 --> 13:53.164

-Don't make small talk
with these guys.

13:56.061 --> 13:57.076
No, no, it's all right.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.895
It's nice to have someone
ask for a change.

13:58.988 --> 14:01.414
Yes, I have four children,

14:12.243 --> 14:13.576

Everything is fine.

14:56.137 --> 14:57.787
I'm happy and in love.

14:57.805 --> 15:00.139
Damn it, Brian, did you leave

-No, no, no, stop it.

15:10.076 --> 15:12.468
all around the room until I find
a place I like for it?

15:12.561 --> 15:14.412
Kind of in the middle
of something, babe!

15:14.639 --> 15:16.563
Ah, the seven-hour itch.

15:16.658 --> 15:18.307
Shut up, Brian.
Why don't you go for a walk?

15:18.401 --> 15:19.825
-(dogs barking excitedly)
-No, no, no, no, no.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.085
No walk. No walk.
No, no.

15:21.237 --> 15:22.403
We're not going for a walk.

15:22.422 --> 15:23.404
I gotta stop saying "walk."

15:23.423 --> 15:25.831
I said walk again.
And there again.

15:25.984 --> 15:28.000
CARRIE:
Honey, I want to make
a stir-fry tonight.

15:28.094 --> 15:29.669
-Have we unpacked the wok?
-(dogs barking louder)

15:29.763 --> 15:31.930
No, no, w-O-K.

15:32.157 --> 15:34.081
W-O-K. She said<i> wok!</i>

15:34.100 --> 15:35.934
(sobbing):
She said wok.

15:36.161 --> 15:38.353
She said wok...

15:50.766 --> 15:52.033
(gasps)

15:53.695 --> 15:56.103
My candy, it's all gone.

15:56.122 --> 15:58.181
Even my West Hollywood candy.

15:58.199 --> 16:01.108
My Twinx bar.
My very Milky Way.

16:01.202 --> 16:03.019
(gasps)
My Reese's Penis.

16:03.112 --> 16:05.021
Who's done this to me?

16:05.114 --> 16:08.424
Who's taken candy
from a baby?

16:15.124 --> 16:18.050
Well, we did it. Cheers.

16:18.144 --> 16:20.144
We sure did, Chris.

16:20.296 --> 16:22.555
-Cool iguana.
-He's dry.

16:22.707 --> 16:24.131
I named him Arid.

16:24.150 --> 16:27.527
Thank you, word-a-day calendar,
travel edition.

16:36.554 --> 16:38.221
Just met some of Carrie's
friends.

16:38.281 --> 16:40.498
They are very excited
for her.

16:40.725 --> 16:43.392
-Well, they should be.
-Well, they should be.

16:43.486 --> 16:44.744
And they are.

16:44.896 --> 16:47.747
Anyway, expectations are high.

16:47.899 --> 16:49.490
(glass clinking)

16:49.509 --> 16:51.843
Thank you, everyone, for coming
to our engagement party.

16:51.994 --> 16:54.161
And an extra thanks
to my airline buddies

16:54.255 --> 16:55.496
for organizing it.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.907
Uh, folks, our party time
tonight is

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
two hours and 48 minutes.

17:00.094 --> 17:01.594
We know you have
lots of choices

17:01.746 --> 17:04.671
for terrible weekend activities,
and we hope to see you soon

17:04.766 --> 17:08.100
on an inconvenient weekend
for their destination wedding,

17:08.194 --> 17:11.937
which I hear is on a Thursday
in Lisbon, Portugal.

17:12.090 --> 17:12.530
-WOMAN: That's so far.
-MAN: Come on!

17:12.757 --> 17:13.939
Yep. Yep.

17:14.034 --> 17:16.259
It's been wonderful meeting
all of Carrie's family

17:16.277 --> 17:18.036
and friends.
(chuckles)

17:18.263 --> 17:20.538
I only wish you were all
wearing nametags.

17:20.765 --> 17:21.539
(laughter)

17:21.766 --> 17:23.190
Isn't he adorable?

17:23.209 --> 17:24.934
My expectations are high.

17:25.027 --> 17:27.027
You know, I first met Carrie
and her niece

17:27.121 --> 17:29.105
a couple of weeks ago
on Halloween.

17:29.123 --> 17:31.340
Thank God they decided
to take that walk.

17:32.868 --> 17:34.777
And now we're headed
down the aisle;

17:34.870 --> 17:36.387
a very different
kind of walk.

17:36.614 --> 17:38.705
(barking excitedly)

17:38.800 --> 17:40.874
And, Carrie,
if I may borrow a line

17:40.894 --> 17:42.285
from our favorite song,

17:42.378 --> 17:44.353
I would walk 500 miles...

17:46.307 --> 17:49.400
Stampede!

17:53.722 --> 17:56.157
(dogs barking)

18:18.098 --> 18:21.582
-Isn't he adorable?
-He loves those dogs.

18:21.676 --> 18:24.727
I'm hearing a lot of good things
about that guy.

18:26.998 --> 18:27.772
That's it.

18:27.999 --> 18:29.440
Glenn, are you okay?

18:29.667 --> 18:30.924
No, I'm not okay.

18:30.944 --> 18:32.777
I thought I could do this,
but I can't.

18:33.004 --> 18:34.670
I've been lying to you,

18:34.763 --> 18:36.355
and I've been lying to myself.

18:36.449 --> 18:37.931
There's something
you need to know.

18:37.951 --> 18:39.859
I hate dogs.

18:39.953 --> 18:41.152
(all gasp)

18:41.379 --> 18:44.789
Uh, this party has begun
its initial descent.

18:45.016 --> 18:46.349
That's not even my dog.

18:46.367 --> 18:49.109
That's Brian, my neighbor's dog.
He can talk.

18:49.129 --> 18:50.519
Brian, say something.

18:50.613 --> 18:51.963
-Brack.
-Bite me.

18:52.190 --> 18:54.373
Glenn... (scoffs)
I can't believe this.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.617
So you don't like dogs,
that's fine.

18:56.636 --> 19:00.805
But you didn't have to lie and
put me through all of this.

19:01.032 --> 19:03.224
Good-bye, Glenn.

19:06.646 --> 19:09.538
Uh, folks, please use caution
as you exit the party

19:09.632 --> 19:12.316
as some of your feelings
may have shifted.

19:12.468 --> 19:14.210
Well, well, well.

19:14.303 --> 19:17.062
Save it, Brian. I'll concede
that you were right.

19:17.215 --> 19:18.881
But you know what?
So was I.

19:18.900 --> 19:20.140
Dogs are the worst.

19:20.234 --> 19:22.902
And I'm coming for you,
Brian the dog.

19:22.996 --> 19:24.811
Maybe not today,
maybe not tomorrow,

19:24.831 --> 19:26.572
But one day.

19:26.666 --> 19:27.832
Maybe tomorrow.

19:28.059 --> 19:29.650
And when that day comes,
you're gonna say,

19:29.669 --> 19:32.244
ooh, Glenn got me good.

19:32.397 --> 19:34.988
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I need to take a walk.

19:35.008 --> 19:37.008
Brack?

19:38.419 --> 19:42.138
Oh, no. Stay...

19:44.926 --> 19:46.225
You're coming back, though,
right?

19:53.267 --> 19:56.268
Hey, Brian, I was just over
talking to Quagmire,

19:56.362 --> 19:57.920
and he thought you might
want to take a look

19:58.013 --> 19:59.030
at my new screenplay.

19:59.181 --> 20:00.180
Oh, I-I don't really, uh...

20:00.200 --> 20:01.774
It's called<i> Ocean's 1.</i>

20:01.926 --> 20:03.426
Between you and me,
I can't believe

20:03.519 --> 20:04.610
nobody's done it before,

20:04.762 --> 20:06.946
to say nothing of
<i> Ocean's 2</i> through<i> 7.</i>

20:07.040 --> 20:09.207
Yeah, I-I could, uh,
take a look, sure.

20:09.434 --> 20:10.783
It's a little long right now.

20:10.935 --> 20:12.601
It's about 430 pages.

20:12.695 --> 20:17.131
I have my "all is lost" moment
on page 389, thereabouts.

20:18.033 --> 20:20.534
Quagmire!

20:20.628 --> 20:24.280
Now, if'n you don't know,
most Hollywood screenplays

20:24.373 --> 20:27.132
wrap up at around 110 pages.

20:27.227 --> 20:30.728
And if'n it's a comedy, why,
you want it in the 90s.

20:30.955 --> 20:34.381
Anyway, they said I could have
these last few seconds

20:34.400 --> 20:37.309
to mention something
near and dear to me.

20:37.403 --> 20:40.980
So, men, don't be afraid
to have the doctor

20:41.074 --> 20:43.908
put a camera up your old
saddle masher.

20:44.059 --> 20:46.727
They knock you out now,
and it's a good way

20:46.746 --> 20:50.155
to make sure there's no
bad beans in your mess wagon.

20:50.308 --> 20:53.400
We hope you've enjoyed
the<i> Family Guy.</i>
