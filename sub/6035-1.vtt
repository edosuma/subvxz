02:54.800 --> 02:55.800
...in case we miss the train
or something.

02:56.144 --> 02:57.965
We have the big place in
Yonkers. Of course, yes.

02:58.065 --> 02:59.642
What did he say?
He said, "Of course."

02:59.742 --> 03:01.306
We're from Texas originally.
Of course.

03:01.406 --> 03:03.165
What did he say?
He said, "Of course!"

03:03.265 --> 03:05.117
Why does he keep saying
the same thing all the time?

03:05.217 --> 03:06.940
My husband's a little deaf.
Of course, yes.

03:07.040 --> 03:08.017
What did he say?

03:08.117 --> 03:10.812
He said, "It's as quiet as a tomb
here." Just what we're looking for!

03:10.912 --> 03:13.467
I don't mind a little life.
We'll be dead soon enough.

03:13.567 --> 03:15.407
Come in.
Concrete.

03:15.889 --> 03:16.863
I said, "Come in!"

03:16.963 --> 03:18.717
I'm fine, thanks. How are you?

03:18.818 --> 03:20.639
I hope all the tenants
aren't as disagreeable.

03:20.739 --> 03:22.331
I can assure you they're not.

03:22.431 --> 03:24.838
The building is very friendly,
efficient, and quiet.

03:25.969 --> 03:27.003
She got in by mistake.

03:27.103 --> 03:28.479
But she's leaving the
first thing in the morning.

03:28.579 --> 03:29.552
What?

03:29.652 --> 03:31.324
I said, "She's leaving the
first thing in the morning."

03:31.424 --> 03:34.191
Who? My wife? Are you going
home to see your mother?

03:36.401 --> 03:39.134
What's that? Canary?
I love birds.

03:39.234 --> 03:41.146
I said, "She's leaving the
first thing in the morning."

03:41.246 --> 03:42.216
You don't have to shout

03:42.316 --> 03:43.934
and your best friend ought
to tell you a little secret.

03:44.034 --> 03:45.564
Just speak
in a low clear voice.

03:45.664 --> 03:47.643
I said, "She's leaving the
first thing in the morning."

03:47.743 --> 03:51.131
She got in by mistake,
but tomorrow, she flies away.

03:51.231 --> 03:54.120
I understand it's a bird.
What about it? I like birds.

03:54.482 --> 03:55.791
It's right here.

03:59.186 --> 04:00.187
Duplex.

04:00.287 --> 04:01.372
What's the ceiling
so high up for?

04:01.472 --> 04:02.972
Why, that's what duplex means.
One floor up over...

04:03.072 --> 04:04.701
You don't seem to keep
the apartment very clean.

04:04.801 --> 04:05.772
What's on the balcony?

04:05.872 --> 04:07.617
You see, the former tenants
aren't getting the service.

04:07.717 --> 04:09.984
A little delinquency
in the rent.

04:10.084 --> 04:12.094
What did he say? I don't
like him to talk to me.

04:12.194 --> 04:14.238
He says the former tenants
haven't been getting any service.

04:14.338 --> 04:16.992
That's why the place is so
dirty. They didn't pay the rent.

04:17.091 --> 04:19.361
I don't mind a little dirt.
That's the trouble with women.

04:19.461 --> 04:21.599
Always fussing around, looking
for something to pick on.

04:21.699 --> 04:22.717
You can
tell me later, Arthur.

04:22.817 --> 04:26.082
Never satisfied with things
the way the Lord made them.

04:26.182 --> 04:29.760
Why, dirt is as natural in
this world as sin, disease,

04:29.860 --> 04:33.161
storms, twisters,
floods, and cyclones.

06:05.753 --> 06:07.812
Is there anything else
you'd like to try?

06:07.912 --> 06:09.955
What you doing in the bathtub
with a wrapper on?

06:10.055 --> 06:12.451
I might ask you what
you're doing in my bathroom.

06:12.551 --> 06:15.336
I don't suppose you go with the
flat. No, that's too much to hope for.

06:15.436 --> 06:17.476
Thank you. I'm glad you
like my perfume, too.

06:17.576 --> 06:18.576
Huh?

06:20.026 --> 06:22.597
I said, "I'm glad
you like my perfume, too."

06:22.697 --> 06:25.188
You have a lovely,
clear voice like a bell.

06:25.288 --> 06:27.845
If I was married to you, I'd
hear everything you said almost,

06:27.945 --> 06:29.158
but you wouldn't enjoy it.

06:29.258 --> 06:31.049
Besides, I'm already married.

06:31.149 --> 06:32.970
So am I.
Me, too.

06:33.070 --> 06:35.224
Anyway,
I'd be too old for you.

06:35.580 --> 06:39.079
"Cold are the hands of time
that creep along relentlessly,

06:39.179 --> 06:43.304
"destroying slowly but without
pity that which yesterday was young.

06:43.404 --> 06:46.056
"Alone our memories
resist this disintegration

06:46.156 --> 06:48.923
"and grow more lovely
with the passing years."

06:49.596 --> 06:51.701
That's hard to say
with false teeth.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.338
You're a funny old man.

06:55.438 --> 06:58.650
I didn't get it, but you looked
very pretty when you said it.

06:58.845 --> 07:00.105
I love birds.

07:00.205 --> 07:01.320
You do?

07:01.420 --> 07:04.041
Say, if they're showing the
apartment and you're still in it,

07:04.141 --> 07:05.482
you must be broke?

07:05.582 --> 07:06.630
No, it doesn't matter.

07:06.730 --> 07:08.058
What did you say?

07:08.381 --> 07:11.162
Yes. That varmint renting
it out from under you?

07:11.262 --> 07:13.577
Yes.
I know how you feel.

07:13.677 --> 07:17.672
I was broke, too, when I was about your age,
but I didn't have a figure like you've got.

07:17.772 --> 07:20.555
I had to use my brains.
You'll get over it.

07:20.655 --> 07:22.378
You'll get over
being young, too.

07:22.478 --> 07:25.259
Someday, you'll wake up and
find everything behind you.

07:25.359 --> 07:26.758
Gives you quite a turn.

07:26.858 --> 07:30.603
Makes you sorry for a few of the things
you didn't do while you still could.

07:30.703 --> 07:31.816
Are you sorry?

07:31.916 --> 07:33.211
How much rent do you owe?

07:33.470 --> 07:34.919
Well, that isn't really
your business.

07:35.019 --> 07:37.046
I can't hear you.
You're mumbling.

07:37.150 --> 07:40.331
I said, "It isn't really
your business!"

07:40.431 --> 07:43.434
I'm in the sausage business.
Don't worry about me.

07:43.534 --> 07:45.000
This'll be a hot one
on the wife.

07:45.100 --> 07:47.626
She's down there poking her
snoot in everybody's business

07:47.726 --> 07:49.640
and egged on by that varmint.

07:49.740 --> 07:51.189
How much do you need?

07:52.032 --> 07:54.381
Don't be silly.
Will $500 cover it?

07:54.481 --> 07:55.723
Please don't talk nonsense.

07:55.823 --> 07:57.677
I can't hear you.
You're mumbling again.

07:57.777 --> 07:59.499
You shouldn't mumble
with such a lovely voice.

07:59.599 --> 08:01.356
I wouldn't do this
for everybody.

08:01.456 --> 08:03.147
Look, this joke
has gone far enough.

08:03.247 --> 08:05.322
You say that ain't enough?
Well, how much do you need?

08:05.422 --> 08:07.403
You're...
You're just embarrassing me.

08:07.503 --> 08:09.327
That's all right,
don't mention it.

08:09.427 --> 08:12.012
It's a privilege to do a favor
for such a beautiful lady.

08:12.112 --> 08:14.398
It makes me feel
young again. There!

08:15.137 --> 08:18.699
How do you suppose it makes me feel? I
haven't seen anything like this for so long.

08:18.799 --> 08:21.706
If you're talking about the money,
forget it. I'm cheesy with money.

08:21.806 --> 08:24.558
I'm the Wienie King.
Invented the Texas Wienie.

08:24.658 --> 08:26.648
Lay off them,
you'll live longer.

08:26.752 --> 08:30.477
Here! Buy yourself a new
dress, too, and a new hat.

08:30.577 --> 08:32.831
You're a fine girl. So long.

08:34.306 --> 08:36.160
Whoopee! Hot diggity!

08:42.881 --> 08:43.856
Hello.

08:43.956 --> 08:46.891
Give me Longacre 56599,
please.

08:46.991 --> 08:49.517
You see, it's strong and safe.
It's simple and practical.

08:49.617 --> 08:52.864
It lets the light and air through and
it's practically invisible from below.

08:53.955 --> 08:55.502
And it's built right in
the middle of the city

08:55.602 --> 08:57.996
instead of way out
in the sticks somewhere.

08:58.096 --> 09:00.898
Excuse me a moment.
Be right back.

09:02.500 --> 09:03.470
Yes?

09:03.570 --> 09:06.445
Darling, the most exciting
thing has happened.

09:06.545 --> 09:09.362
Look, honey, I'm right in the middle of
a talk with a very important gentleman.

09:09.462 --> 09:10.736
Could you tell me later?

09:10.836 --> 09:12.129
All right, dear.

09:15.300 --> 09:16.624
Of course,
this is the big one.

09:16.724 --> 09:19.597
But to build a working model in
some field or village somewhere

09:19.697 --> 09:21.424
that small planes
could actually land on

09:21.524 --> 09:25.266
to prove that it was practical,
would only cost about $99,000.

09:25.366 --> 09:27.171
After that, we'd be on velvet.

09:28.100 --> 09:31.404
You see, it's a steel mesh
made of stretched cables.

09:31.504 --> 09:33.777
Every municipality, every
town, every city needs one.

09:33.877 --> 09:34.927
My patent is basic.

09:35.027 --> 09:36.623
$99,000 is a lot of money.

09:36.723 --> 09:38.865
But it isn't what it costs,
it's what it brings you back.

09:38.965 --> 09:42.706
You see, I've got $99,000 now, but if
I was to build this thing, I might...

09:42.806 --> 09:45.491
Look, let's start all over
again from the beginning.

09:45.591 --> 09:47.503
Well, go ahead.
My time ain't worth anything.

09:47.603 --> 09:48.670
I'm retired.

09:56.741 --> 09:57.741
Psst!

09:59.335 --> 10:01.189
Hey, Mike, come here a minute.

10:03.431 --> 10:06.131
Take a gander inside, will you, and
see if the manager's gone to dinner?

10:06.231 --> 10:08.403
I don't want to see
him face-to-face. Sure.

10:08.503 --> 10:11.766
But if it's the rent you're thinking about,
you can go in and whistle up his nose.

10:11.866 --> 10:13.686
It's paid. It's paid? What
do you mean, "It's paid"?

10:13.786 --> 10:15.092
It's paid.
Who paid it?

10:15.192 --> 10:16.592
Your wife.
My wife?

10:16.692 --> 10:19.698
I'm sure it wasn't mine.
An old man gave her the money.

10:19.798 --> 10:20.775
An old man gave her the money?

10:20.875 --> 10:22.321
What do you mean, "An old
man gave her the money?"

10:22.421 --> 10:26.166
I said I'm taking you to dinner, and
then the theater, and then supper.

10:26.266 --> 10:28.371
So hurry up
and put on your dinner jacket.

10:28.471 --> 10:29.732
Just a minute.

10:29.928 --> 10:32.499
What's all this malarkey about
some old man paying the rent for you

10:32.599 --> 10:34.260
that the whole building
is buzzing with?

10:34.360 --> 10:36.084
It's not malarkey, darling.

10:36.184 --> 10:38.545
Here's the receipted bill.
You see, it says "paid."

10:38.645 --> 10:41.171
And I paid the butcher, and
the grocer, and the drugstore.

10:41.271 --> 10:42.867
And I got this dress,
and had my hair done,

10:42.967 --> 10:45.043
and six pairs of stockings,
and some new shoes.

10:45.143 --> 10:47.894
And here's $14 in change.
That's for you.

10:47.994 --> 10:49.717
Isn't it wonderful?
Sensational.

10:49.817 --> 10:51.443
But you haven't quite
answered my question yet.

10:51.543 --> 10:52.520
What question, dear?

10:52.620 --> 10:54.772
Why this alleged old man
gave you... How much is it?

10:54.872 --> 10:56.818
$700.
$700.

10:56.918 --> 10:58.662
Why?
No reason.

10:59.049 --> 11:02.165
Is that so? He just... $700
just like that? Just like that.

11:02.265 --> 11:03.958
I mean, sex didn't even
enter into it.

11:04.058 --> 11:06.581
Oh, but of course
it did, darling.

11:06.681 --> 11:09.652
I don't think he'd have given it
to me if I had hair like excelsior

11:09.752 --> 11:11.381
and little short legs
like an alligator.

11:11.481 --> 11:13.239
Sex always has something
to do with it, dear.

11:13.339 --> 11:15.251
I see. From the time you're about so big

11:15.351 --> 11:17.235
and wondering
why your girlfriends' fathers

11:17.335 --> 11:19.161
are getting so arch
all of a sudden.

11:19.261 --> 11:22.343
Nothing wrong, just an overture
to the opera that's coming.

11:23.468 --> 11:25.461
I see.
No, you don't really.

11:25.561 --> 11:27.957
But from then on, you get
it from cops, taxi drivers,

11:28.057 --> 11:29.816
bellboys,
delicatessen dealers...

11:29.916 --> 11:30.908
Got what?

11:31.008 --> 11:31.994
The look.

11:32.094 --> 11:34.166
You know, "How's about
this evening, babe?"

11:34.266 --> 11:35.862
So this gent
gave you the look.

11:35.962 --> 11:37.752
The Wienie King? Oh, no.

11:37.852 --> 11:40.536
At his age, darling,
it was really more of a blink.

11:40.636 --> 11:42.327
Really?
This is very illuminating.

11:42.427 --> 11:43.802
Well, you don't have to
get rigid about it.

11:43.902 --> 11:45.657
It was perfectly innocent,
I assure you.

11:45.757 --> 11:47.780
Where did you meet
this Wienie King?

11:48.205 --> 11:49.718
You'll die laughing
when you hear.

11:49.818 --> 11:51.365
All right. Convulse me.

11:52.972 --> 11:55.640
In the bathtub.
In the bathtub?

11:55.740 --> 11:57.464
Yes, isn't that charming?
Delicious.

11:57.564 --> 11:58.906
What were you doing
in the bathtub?

11:59.006 --> 12:00.917
I was hiding from him.
Hiding?

12:01.017 --> 12:03.224
What kind of games do you
play around here while I'm out?

12:03.324 --> 12:05.464
I wish you could have seen
the expression on his face.

12:05.564 --> 12:06.890
I'm glad I didn't.

12:07.086 --> 12:08.599
How much water was there
in the tub?

12:08.699 --> 12:10.523
I was standing
in the bathtub, foolish.

12:10.623 --> 12:12.216
You were standing
in the bathtub?

12:12.316 --> 12:13.895
In my pink wrapper.

12:14.382 --> 12:17.211
Darling, he was just a funny
little old man in a funny hat.

12:17.311 --> 12:19.643
He sat on the edge of the bed
and talked for a while.

12:19.743 --> 12:21.370
He's on the bed now, is he?

12:21.470 --> 12:23.513
There aren't any chairs
in the bedroom, darling.

12:23.613 --> 12:25.592
Well, what was he doing
in the bedroom?

12:25.692 --> 12:27.418
He wanted
to rent the apartment,

12:27.518 --> 12:31.099
but when he found out we were
broke, he gave me $700 and he left.

12:31.199 --> 12:32.427
Just like that.

12:32.624 --> 12:33.948
Well, I did kiss him goodbye.

12:34.048 --> 12:35.707
Now the truth is coming out.

12:35.807 --> 12:36.807
The...

12:37.360 --> 12:38.361
The truth.

12:38.461 --> 12:41.336
You just tell me where this Wienie King
lives and I'll take his money back to him

12:41.436 --> 12:43.832
and tell him what I think of it. I
don't know where he lives, darling.

12:43.932 --> 12:46.841
I don't even know his name and I
don't think they'd give the money back.

12:46.941 --> 12:48.953
I mean, the grocer
and the drugstore and all.

12:49.053 --> 12:51.388
You really couldn't blame them
after they waited so long.

12:51.488 --> 12:53.359
That's right. Rub it in.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.429
Tom.
Yes.

13:05.393 --> 13:08.011
It's wonderful to have
the rent paid, isn't it?

13:08.529 --> 13:11.496
And the bills settled up.
You feel free and clean,

13:12.208 --> 13:14.266
and I like that feeling. I
wish it were always like that.

13:14.366 --> 13:15.814
Don't you think I do?

13:16.144 --> 13:18.348
I'd almost forgotten
what it was like.

13:18.960 --> 13:23.069
I don't look forward to being in debt again
and slinking past everybody. I dread it.

13:23.169 --> 13:26.139
It isn't going to be for always.
Everybody's a flop until he's a success.

13:26.239 --> 13:28.575
Something's bound to come
through. I got too many good ideas.

13:28.675 --> 13:30.666
Say, there's
a $2 overcharge here.

13:31.539 --> 13:34.386
Now that everything's paid up,
you could move.

13:35.282 --> 13:37.137
Well, where'd we go?

13:38.066 --> 13:40.587
I wasn't thinking about me.
I just meant you.

13:41.779 --> 13:44.300
Oh. You mean the bust-up?

13:45.395 --> 13:46.395
Hmm-mmm.

13:47.508 --> 13:49.501
When did you get that idea?
This afternoon?

13:49.601 --> 13:52.288
I've had it for some time,
but something always said,

13:52.388 --> 13:55.519
"Wait till he crashes through,
wait till he's made one success."

13:55.619 --> 13:57.343
You'll never make a success
with me around.

13:57.443 --> 14:00.395
I'm just a milestone
around your neck. Millstone.

14:01.332 --> 14:02.526
I'm no good for you, darling.

14:02.626 --> 14:05.630
I don't mean I'm not good for
somebody, but I can't cook or sew

14:05.730 --> 14:08.066
or whip up a little dress out
of last year's window curtains.

14:08.166 --> 14:09.158
What difference
does that make?

14:09.258 --> 14:11.937
I'm just like a car that only
gives seven miles to the tankful,

14:12.037 --> 14:13.436
only, you haven't got
the tankful.

14:13.536 --> 14:15.892
Are you sure
you haven't got a tankful?

14:16.501 --> 14:18.397
You see, by yourself,
you could live so simply.

14:18.497 --> 14:21.185
I mean, just a little room anywhere
or maybe move in with your brother,

14:21.285 --> 14:23.262
or even use the couch
in your office.

14:23.362 --> 14:25.120
And you wouldn't keep
slipping back all the time.

14:25.220 --> 14:27.613
You could balance what you earned
and look the world in the eye

14:27.713 --> 14:29.279
and maybe even
get ahead a little.

14:29.379 --> 14:31.105
Thanks. And what would
you be doing?

14:31.205 --> 14:32.255
That's no problem.

14:32.355 --> 14:34.912
You can always find a good
provider if you really want one.

14:35.012 --> 14:38.016
He may not look like a movie star,
but... We'll get ahead someday.

14:38.116 --> 14:41.763
But I don't want it someday. I want
it now while I can still enjoy it.

14:41.863 --> 14:43.684
Anyway, men don't get smarter
as they grow older,

14:43.784 --> 14:45.183
they just lose their hair.

14:45.283 --> 14:46.336
Gerry...
But, I would.

14:46.436 --> 14:48.481
I'm very tired
of being broke, darling.

14:48.581 --> 14:51.234
And feeling so helpless
about having my hands tied.

14:51.334 --> 14:53.344
I could've helped you
so many times,

14:53.444 --> 14:56.164
but every time I tried to, you
tried to punch the man in the nose.

14:56.264 --> 14:57.604
Don't talk rot.

14:57.704 --> 14:59.908
How about that president
of the smelting company?

15:00.008 --> 15:00.977
That wolf.

15:01.077 --> 15:03.041
He's still the president
of a smelting company.

15:03.141 --> 15:04.834
And we might've been
in the smelting business now

15:04.934 --> 15:06.400
and paying our rent.
Lovely.

15:06.500 --> 15:08.384
He liked you very much
he said.

15:08.484 --> 15:10.724
The less I hear about that
hyena, the better I'll like it.

15:10.824 --> 15:12.132
But that's what's
so irritating.

15:12.232 --> 15:16.129
To know that I could get you someplace,
without doing any harm, either.

15:16.229 --> 15:19.618
You have no idea what a long-legged
gal can do without doing anything.

15:19.718 --> 15:22.885
And instead of that, I have to
watch you stamping around proudly.

15:22.985 --> 15:26.019
Like Sitting Bull in a new
blanket, breathing through your nose

15:26.119 --> 15:28.001
while we both starve to death.
Thanks.

15:28.101 --> 15:29.569
You don't have to keep saying
thanks all the time.

15:29.669 --> 15:30.640
I'm not being so nice.

15:30.740 --> 15:31.876
That's the first time
I've said it.

15:31.976 --> 15:33.732
If you want a divorce, you're
certainly entitled to it,

15:33.832 --> 15:35.265
but I don't know
where the money's coming from.

15:35.365 --> 15:36.677
The next husband
always pays for that.

15:36.777 --> 15:39.940
You have him all picked out,
have you? You're such a child.

15:40.040 --> 15:43.735
He doesn't happen to be in the sausage
business by any chance, does he?

15:43.897 --> 15:47.363
I may not even get married again.
I might become an adventuress.

15:47.463 --> 15:50.614
I can just see you starting
for China in a 26-foot sailboat.

15:50.905 --> 15:52.834
You're thinking
of an adventurer, dear.

15:52.934 --> 15:56.836
An adventuress never goes on anything
under 300 feet with a crew of 80.

15:56.936 --> 16:00.550
You just let me catch you on a 300-foot
yacht, or even a 200-foot yacht.

16:00.650 --> 16:03.301
At least I wouldn't have
to worry about the rent.

16:03.401 --> 16:06.021
I'm sorry.
Let's go and have some dinner.

16:06.121 --> 16:08.726
How can you think of food
at a moment like this?

16:08.924 --> 16:11.941
Because I'm a woman, maybe, and
a little more practical than you.

16:12.041 --> 16:15.396
Are you going to put on your dinner
jacket, or shall I take off my new dress?

16:15.496 --> 16:16.912
Is that a new dress?

16:19.931 --> 16:21.638
You'll always be
a sister to me, huh?

16:21.738 --> 16:24.132
I know it sounds stupid,
but I'm a rotten wife.

16:24.232 --> 16:27.464
I can't sew, I can't cook.
You certainly can't.

16:27.564 --> 16:29.060
But just because
I'm a useless wife

16:29.160 --> 16:31.466
doesn't mean I couldn't be very
valuable to you as a sister.

16:31.566 --> 16:33.353
But very valuable.

16:33.453 --> 16:35.542
I remember that pot roast
you tried.

16:36.028 --> 16:37.444
And all the boys
who want to go out with me

16:37.544 --> 16:39.850
would naturally have to be
in your good graces.

16:39.950 --> 16:41.349
Naturally. Or I wouldn't
go out with them.

16:41.449 --> 16:42.599
I'll say you wouldn't.

16:42.699 --> 16:44.457
They'll probably offer you
partnerships.

16:44.557 --> 16:46.982
In the smelting business.
In the... No.

16:47.082 --> 16:48.059
You could have your choice.

16:48.159 --> 16:50.501
I don't begin and end
with a smelter, you know.

16:50.601 --> 16:53.752
I refuse to understand what
you're talking about, Geraldine.

16:53.916 --> 16:55.495
They'd work you in on deals

16:55.595 --> 16:58.281
and let you in on all the good things
that were happening in the market

16:58.381 --> 17:00.391
and that kind of business.
Monkey business.

17:00.491 --> 17:03.739
Well, very few pretty girls'
brothers have ever failed, you know.

17:03.839 --> 17:06.188
If they knew enough
to come in out of a hailstorm.

17:06.288 --> 17:08.232
Well, in the first place, I
don't happen to be your brother.

17:08.332 --> 17:09.642
In the second place,
may I ask

17:09.742 --> 17:12.825
who are all these men who are
going to faint at your feet?

17:12.925 --> 17:15.114
You think there aren't any. I
didn't say there weren't any.

17:15.214 --> 17:16.296
I just said, "Where are they?"

17:16.396 --> 17:20.661
They're around. They're always there
and they make new ones every year.

17:20.767 --> 17:22.124
I don't want to be rude,
honey, but...

17:22.223 --> 17:24.104
You're not being rude, dear,
you're just being yourself.

17:24.204 --> 17:27.690
You see, you're married to me.
That's like saying you're blind to me.

17:27.790 --> 17:29.483
For a long time,
I've been a part of you,

17:29.583 --> 17:32.747
just something to snuggle up to and
keep you warm at night, like a blanket.

17:32.847 --> 17:35.661
But you can't see me any more than
you can see the back of your neck.

17:35.761 --> 17:37.995
I put on new dresses,
I change my hair...

17:38.095 --> 17:41.545
Would you mind not looking quite so
gorgeous while you say all these things?

17:41.645 --> 17:43.388
You're just plastered.
Yes.

17:43.488 --> 17:46.488
Well, I'd better get you home
before you fall apart.

17:47.488 --> 17:50.732
Or do you object to spending the
night under the same roof with me?

17:50.832 --> 17:52.823
I wasn't thinking
about the roof.

17:53.729 --> 17:54.729
Come on.

17:55.168 --> 17:57.339
Just a minute.
I gotta pay the check.

18:08.034 --> 18:10.092
I'll sleep on the thing here.

18:10.192 --> 18:11.917
You know we don't love
each other anymore.

18:12.017 --> 18:14.174
We're just habits. Bad habits.

18:15.778 --> 18:18.381
They don't make these zippers
as well as they used to.

18:18.481 --> 18:21.965
And when love's gone, there's nothing
left but admiration and respect.

18:22.065 --> 18:24.800
I think it's stuck. Will
you see if you can get it?

18:27.650 --> 18:29.505
Come around here in the light.

18:46.499 --> 18:47.993
Keep still, will you?

18:51.651 --> 18:54.368
You don't think this is
a little intimate, do you?

18:57.924 --> 19:00.781
Doesn't mean anything to
you anymore to sit on my lap?

19:00.881 --> 19:01.881
No.

19:02.149 --> 19:04.336
Or if I kiss you there?

19:04.436 --> 19:05.533
Stop it. No.

19:06.148 --> 19:07.148
Or here?

19:08.548 --> 19:09.726
It's nothing.

19:09.892 --> 19:10.892
Or here?

19:11.108 --> 19:13.005
You know I'm ticklish.

19:13.105 --> 19:14.671
Then why is
your breath coming faster?

19:14.771 --> 19:16.512
Because you're squeezing me.

19:21.925 --> 19:24.544
That doesn't mean anything
to you anymore, huh?

19:24.710 --> 19:25.954
Almost nothing.

19:26.407 --> 19:27.836
Almost nothing, huh?

19:39.335 --> 19:43.632
Almost nothing. Nothing
but a habit, a bad habit.

19:43.732 --> 19:44.799
It is, huh?

19:45.159 --> 19:47.697
Very, very bad, and wicked,

19:47.797 --> 19:50.354
and stupid, and useless,

19:50.454 --> 19:53.920
and young,
and impractical, and...

20:59.435 --> 21:01.174
Oh, darling!
What's the big idea?

21:01.274 --> 21:02.616
Darling, read the note.

21:02.716 --> 21:05.547
Goodbye. God bless you.
Take care of yourself.

21:14.315 --> 21:15.315
Hey!

21:39.244 --> 21:40.407
Hey, will you wait a minute?

21:40.507 --> 21:42.071
No, I won't.
I've made up my mind.

21:42.171 --> 21:43.352
It's best for both of us

21:43.452 --> 21:45.496
while we're still young enough
to make other connections.

21:45.596 --> 21:46.998
But you're forgetting
a little thing called love.

21:47.098 --> 21:49.209
Honey, I love you and you love
me. That's all that matters.

21:49.309 --> 21:52.229
That's all you can take with
you. Everything else is...

21:52.494 --> 21:54.903
I'm so sorry. Please
accept all my apologies.

21:55.003 --> 21:56.003
Gerry!

22:21.455 --> 22:22.633
Hey, Officer!

22:24.303 --> 22:26.776
Hold that woman!
She stole my suitcase!

22:26.876 --> 22:28.172
Why, you lying...

22:29.999 --> 22:31.342
You mean this one?

22:31.984 --> 22:33.991
That's right!
I'll be right down.

22:36.208 --> 22:38.746
Do I look like
a suitcase stealer to you?

22:38.846 --> 22:42.443
It isn't how you look, it's how you
behave that counts in this world.

22:44.432 --> 22:46.425
Now, I mind the time...
Oh, wise guy.

22:46.525 --> 22:47.961
Thanks for holding her,
Officer.

22:48.061 --> 22:50.268
You want to prepare charges or
something disagreeable like that?

22:50.368 --> 22:53.209
No, I prefer not to. This is my
wife. Mrs. Jeffers, Mr. Mulligan.

22:53.309 --> 22:55.771
The name happens to be O'Donnell,
if it's all the same to you.

22:55.871 --> 22:57.403
And I've a good mind to
charge you with false arrest,

22:57.503 --> 22:58.783
only, I don't know
if I could make it stick.

22:58.883 --> 23:00.126
Why don't you try?

23:00.226 --> 23:02.203
It's too nice a morning.
The heck with it.

23:02.303 --> 23:05.290
Why don't you two learn to
get along together? I had to.

23:05.746 --> 23:06.730
Now what?

23:06.830 --> 23:08.315
Now, will you come back
upstairs and be sensible?

23:08.415 --> 23:10.460
No, I won't!
Give me back my suitcase!

23:10.560 --> 23:13.375
It was hard enough to make up my
mind to do what I know is right.

23:13.475 --> 23:15.516
If I don't do it now, I'll
never be strong enough again.

23:15.616 --> 23:16.668
Now give me my suitcase.

23:16.768 --> 23:18.592
Stop talking like a fool,
Gerry. Where are you going?

23:18.692 --> 23:20.092
To visit your sister
in Long Island? Taxi!

23:20.192 --> 23:21.595
No, I'm going
to get a divorce.

23:21.695 --> 23:22.975
How can you get a divorce
without any money?

23:23.075 --> 23:25.084
How can you go any place?
Why don't you be sensible?

23:25.184 --> 23:26.269
You've just got a hangover.

23:26.369 --> 23:28.510
I don't need any money.
I've already told you.

23:28.610 --> 23:29.610
Taxi!

23:31.859 --> 23:33.853
Yes, ma'am? Where's the
best place to get a divorce?

23:33.953 --> 23:35.296
Gerry, for heaven's sake!

23:35.396 --> 23:37.981
Well, most people go to Reno, Nevada,
but for my money, it's Palm Beach.

23:38.081 --> 23:39.229
This time of the year,
you got the track,

23:39.329 --> 23:41.185
you got the ocean, you got
palm trees, three months.

23:41.285 --> 23:42.254
You leave from Penn Station.

23:42.354 --> 23:43.358
Look, I'm in awful trouble.

23:43.458 --> 23:45.437
I haven't got a dime. Would
you take me there for nothing?

23:45.537 --> 23:46.557
To where? Palm Beach?

23:46.657 --> 23:48.400
No, no. Just to the station.

23:48.820 --> 23:50.144
Sure. Hop in, babe.
Thanks!

23:50.244 --> 23:51.741
Listen, you!
Listen what?

23:51.841 --> 23:54.113
Will you give me my suitcase?
Give the lady her suitcase.

23:54.213 --> 23:55.309
Listen, you!

23:55.636 --> 23:57.985
Now look what you've done!
Look what I've done?

23:58.085 --> 23:59.824
Yeah. Look what you've done!

24:01.908 --> 24:02.908
Hey!

24:03.507 --> 24:05.362
What's the trouble now?
Taxi!

24:05.588 --> 24:07.412
Pick this stuff up, will you?

24:07.766 --> 24:08.813
Hey, you...

24:20.086 --> 24:21.086
Gerry!

24:23.222 --> 24:25.727
Gerry. Gerry, why, stop behaving
like a chicken with its head cut off.

24:25.827 --> 24:26.804
You haven't got any money.

24:26.904 --> 24:28.578
Where can you go?
I got this far, didn't I?

24:28.678 --> 24:29.954
But, Gerry...
Where's my suitcase?

24:30.054 --> 24:31.697
But, listen, honey.
Goodbye.

24:35.223 --> 24:37.379
Listen to me, you're making a fool out
of yourself, right in front of all...

24:37.479 --> 24:39.424
Officer, this man is trying to
molest me. Will you stop him?

24:39.524 --> 24:41.283
Where you going in such a
hurry, laddy? Thank you so much.

24:41.383 --> 24:43.872
Now, you let the dames alone
at Pennsylvania Station,

24:43.972 --> 24:46.049
Pennsylvania Station will
leave you alone and vice versa.

24:46.149 --> 24:47.492
That's my wife,
you dumb cluck!

24:47.592 --> 24:49.120
So now I'm a dumb cluck, am I?

24:49.220 --> 24:51.778
I like peace,
but I ain't morbid about it.

24:51.878 --> 24:54.530
Now, stop annoying these Janes
or I'll lock you up!

24:54.630 --> 24:55.973
Attention, please.

24:56.073 --> 25:01.222
Last call. Atlantic Coast Line,
Florida Special, Advance Section

25:01.322 --> 25:04.599
leaving from Gate 12
in five minutes.

25:04.920 --> 25:06.562
Attention, please.

25:06.662 --> 25:09.892
Miami Special, due 11:21,
Track 3,

25:09.992 --> 25:11.748
arriving 12:04.

25:11.848 --> 25:14.337
Track 6 from Rockingham,
Burns,

25:14.437 --> 25:16.978
Charleston Springs,
and Saratoga.

25:19.674 --> 25:20.966
Pratt, Ale and Quail.
Pratt.

25:21.066 --> 25:22.773
Billdocker.
Billdocker.

25:23.226 --> 25:24.753
Hitchcock.
Hitchcock.

25:25.306 --> 25:26.353
Hotchkiss.

25:27.386 --> 25:30.437
I see we got the club
again, Ed. You're telling me.

25:30.537 --> 25:33.411
Just let them try and
start something. Hot dog.

25:33.511 --> 25:34.505
Is anything the matter, lady?

25:34.605 --> 25:37.124
I'll be all right. I'm sure
they'll come with my ticket.

25:37.224 --> 25:38.852
Did somebody forget
your ticket?

25:38.952 --> 25:41.735
I'm sure it'll be all right. It's
just that I have to get to Palm Beach.

25:41.835 --> 25:43.859
That's too bad. Dr. Kluck.

25:44.411 --> 25:46.853
I'm sure they'll come.
I beg your pardon.

25:46.953 --> 25:49.445
I'm sorry.
I was talking to the gateman.

25:49.545 --> 25:50.564
McKeewie.
McKeewie.

25:50.664 --> 25:52.935
I'm sure my ticket will come.
It must come.

25:53.035 --> 25:55.621
Oh, yes, it must.
By all means.

25:55.721 --> 25:57.512
Asweld. You say your ticket
didn't come yet?

25:57.612 --> 26:00.912
You haven't got much time. No,
but it'll be here. I'm sure.

26:01.819 --> 26:04.688
If there's anything
I can do... Thank you.

26:05.338 --> 26:07.511
Name, please. Go ahead.

26:08.444 --> 26:09.893
Hinch and valet.
Hinch.

26:09.993 --> 26:11.493
I'm sure it'll be all right.

26:11.593 --> 26:12.996
Is there something the matter,
madam?

26:13.096 --> 26:15.622
Nothing that anyone
can help me with, I'm afraid.

26:15.722 --> 26:18.375
It just looks as if my ticket
isn't going to get here on time.

26:18.475 --> 26:21.689
My gracious! There ought to be
some solution to that problem.

26:22.044 --> 26:23.767
I can't think of any.

26:24.316 --> 26:25.428
My gracious.

26:25.564 --> 26:27.369
No ticket?
No ticket.

26:27.469 --> 26:28.810
Jones.
Jones.

26:28.910 --> 26:30.965
Featherwax.
Featherwax.

26:31.293 --> 26:32.668
Attention, please.

26:33.277 --> 26:37.620
Florida Mail leaving through
Gate 9 at 11:57.

26:38.206 --> 26:41.322
Newark, Trenton,
North Philadelphia,

26:41.422 --> 26:44.755
Philadelphia, Baltimore,
Washington...

26:45.309 --> 26:47.303
You'd think one of them
would offer a lady a ticket.

26:47.403 --> 26:48.806
Oh, well, I couldn't
accept it.

26:48.906 --> 26:50.901
Why not? Rich millionaires?

26:51.934 --> 26:54.439
I have a feeling that
everything's gonna be all right.

26:54.539 --> 26:55.956
Aye!
Aye!

27:02.367 --> 27:03.815
Did it come yet?
No, but it's all right.

27:03.915 --> 27:05.513
What'd you mean it's all
right? It's far from all right.

27:05.613 --> 27:07.689
You see, we have a wonderful idea.
The other members and myself...

27:07.789 --> 27:09.514
You see, we have a private
car. We have tons of tickets.

27:09.614 --> 27:11.495
I could never accept. We're
just going to Savannah...

27:11.595 --> 27:12.972
But if you want to go
any further, we'd gladly...

27:13.072 --> 27:15.210
You can be our mascot.
You must be our mascot.

27:15.310 --> 27:17.515
Do you think it's all right?
All right? It's perfect.

27:17.615 --> 27:19.209
Then thank you
for your chivalry, gentlemen.

27:19.309 --> 27:21.451
I accept with pleasure.
The pleasure is ours.

27:21.551 --> 27:23.081
This is Asweld
of the American Asweldocan.

27:23.181 --> 27:24.940
Mr. Hinch. You've heard of
Hinch's Emulsion, I presume?

27:25.040 --> 27:26.413
And I am McKeewie
of the Seventh National.

27:26.513 --> 27:28.521
And I am Mrs. Thomas Jeffers,
alias Geraldine.

27:28.621 --> 27:29.867
Geraldine!

27:29.967 --> 27:31.276
And thank you
for your chivalry.

27:31.376 --> 27:33.002
Anytime from 8:00 to 12:00.

27:33.102 --> 27:34.103
Gerry!

27:34.496 --> 27:35.740
Goodbye, dear.

27:39.137 --> 27:40.493
Let me through there!
You got a ticket?

27:40.593 --> 27:42.025
Hey!
No ticket, no passing.

27:42.125 --> 27:43.243
Now, listen!

27:43.343 --> 27:45.102
All aboard!

27:45.202 --> 27:47.193
Gerry! Gerry!

28:44.867 --> 28:46.940
Hi. Come on in.
Oh, hello.

28:47.524 --> 28:49.394
Glad you... Glad you could come. Here!

28:49.494 --> 28:51.600
Not while we're on duty,
thanks. Who's the headman here?

28:51.700 --> 28:53.230
You mean the president
of the club?

28:53.330 --> 28:54.766
Whoever has the tickets,
we don't care.

28:54.866 --> 28:56.610
Oh, Ozzie! Front and center!

28:58.374 --> 29:00.691
There's Mr. Osmond, President
of the Ale and Quail Club.

29:00.791 --> 29:02.767
How are you?
It's about the tickets.

29:02.867 --> 29:05.683
How many in the party?
How many members in this club?

29:05.783 --> 29:10.501
Well, there's... There's...
There's Ozzie and Hitchie,

29:11.078 --> 29:12.402
and him, and him.

29:12.502 --> 29:14.770
That makes four. And you
and me, that makes six.

29:14.870 --> 29:16.977
I'm not a member of
this club. And why not?

29:17.077 --> 29:18.769
It isn't good enough
for you, eh?

29:18.869 --> 29:20.946
Now, let's get this straight.
How many members are there?

29:21.046 --> 29:23.154
One, two, three,
four, five, six. Six!

29:23.254 --> 29:25.362
All right, that's three.
Now, we'll start from there.

29:25.462 --> 29:26.895
You trying to make
a liar out of me?

29:26.995 --> 29:31.188
Mr. President, I move
that this member be expelled.

29:31.288 --> 29:33.777
Second the motion.
All those in favor say aye.

29:33.877 --> 29:35.456
Aye!
Aye!

29:36.231 --> 29:37.647
All right, we're expelled.

29:37.747 --> 29:39.825
Have a drink, boys.
Hey, that's four.

29:39.925 --> 29:42.961
That's seven. One, two,
three, four, five, six, seven.

29:43.061 --> 29:44.528
What's the matter with you?
You cockeyed?

29:44.628 --> 29:47.473
It ain't me that's cockeyed.
Looking for trouble, eh?

29:47.573 --> 29:50.593
Mr. Osmond doesn't always
carry his liquor to perfection.

29:53.031 --> 29:55.732
Now, let's start this all over.
Now, just a moment, Officer.

29:55.832 --> 29:58.565
I'm not an officer. I'm
the conductor on this train.

29:58.952 --> 30:01.491
All in flavor say aye.
- Aye!

30:01.591 --> 30:03.025
Opposed?
- Nay!

30:03.125 --> 30:05.666
Opposition vote.
- No!

30:11.946 --> 30:12.947
Good night.
Good night.

30:13.047 --> 30:14.903
If there's the slightest
trouble, just knock on my wall.

30:15.003 --> 30:16.882
Thank you, Mr...
Don't give it a thought.

30:16.982 --> 30:20.182
As I have so often said at dinners
and our little gatherings...

30:20.282 --> 30:21.844
Where's your baggage?
My... What?

30:21.944 --> 30:23.987
Where's your luggage? What
are you going to sleep in?

30:24.087 --> 30:25.398
That's quite all right.
I'll just...

30:25.498 --> 30:26.995
You see, I left so hurriedly.

30:27.095 --> 30:28.853
Why, bless my soul!
You stay right here.

30:28.953 --> 30:30.326
I'll have you a pair of
pajamas before you can say...

30:30.426 --> 30:31.402
What size do you take?

30:31.502 --> 30:35.177
Never mind. You'll have to take my size.
They maybe a little bit big, but still...

30:36.907 --> 30:39.256
...turning ever

30:39.356 --> 30:43.233
That's where
the old folks stay

30:44.426 --> 30:49.926
All the world
is sad and dreary

30:50.026 --> 30:53.287
Everywhere I roam

30:55.082 --> 31:01.624
Oh, darkies,
how my heart grows weary

31:01.724 --> 31:05.963
Far from the old folks at home

31:14.957 --> 31:16.004
Any calls?

31:35.341 --> 31:37.561
Hello, there. Where's that
pretty girl with the nice figure

31:37.661 --> 31:39.126
that lives here
that I seen yesterday?

31:39.226 --> 31:41.655
Who are you?
I'm fine, thanks. How are you?

31:41.755 --> 31:43.099
You must be her husband.
Where is she?

31:43.199 --> 31:45.208
What's that to your business?
I'm in the sausage business.

31:45.308 --> 31:47.223
Just wanted to tell her
we moved in after all.

31:47.323 --> 31:50.296
Took the green apartment down the hall
that the opera singer moved out of.

31:50.396 --> 31:51.373
She's gone.

31:51.473 --> 31:54.327
I say she's gone! She's gone to
Florida. She's going to divorce me.

31:54.427 --> 31:55.895
You say she's gone?
That's right.

31:55.995 --> 31:58.553
Good for her. A pretty girl
like that can get anybody.

31:58.653 --> 32:01.112
Why hang around with a man
that can't pay the rent?

32:01.212 --> 32:02.938
Look here, you old rattlebrain.
You've made trouble enough

32:03.038 --> 32:05.690
without getting insulting about it.
Don't you threaten me, you big baboon.

32:05.790 --> 32:08.858
I'm twice your age and only half as big,
but I'm mighty handy with this cane...

32:08.958 --> 32:11.034
All right, I'm sorry. I guess
you didn't mean any harm.

32:11.134 --> 32:13.159
You're probably
very kind at that.

32:14.832 --> 32:16.889
You say she's gone and
left you? That's right.

32:16.989 --> 32:18.521
How did she go? By train?

32:18.621 --> 32:19.900
That's right. That's right!

32:20.000 --> 32:22.393
Why don't you fly down there
in an aerioplane

32:22.493 --> 32:23.773
with a bunch of roses
in your hand

32:23.873 --> 32:25.785
and meet her when she gets off
and bring her home?

32:25.885 --> 32:27.353
Because I'm not
in the sausage business!

32:27.453 --> 32:30.971
So am I. And it's a good business if
you know where to get the meat cheap.

32:31.071 --> 32:34.076
That's my secret
and I ain't telling no one.

32:34.176 --> 32:36.603
Have you money for an
aerioplane ticket? No!

32:36.703 --> 32:39.519
Then why don't you say so instead of
standing there like a big stinkweed?

32:39.619 --> 32:41.063
How much do you need?

32:47.505 --> 32:48.862
Open the door!
What'd you say?

32:48.962 --> 32:50.800
- Open the door!
- Open the door!

32:51.890 --> 32:53.214
We want you to hear something.

32:53.314 --> 32:55.102
But I've gone to bed.
That's all right.

32:55.202 --> 32:57.342
When you get back in bed,
we'll put you to sleep.

32:57.442 --> 32:59.728
Come right in, boys.
Now, take your places.

33:00.754 --> 33:02.926
Now, we all set?
Everybody all right?

33:05.267 --> 33:07.760
Sweet Adeline

33:08.211 --> 33:10.704
Sweet Adeline

33:11.795 --> 33:13.713
My Adeline

33:14.546 --> 33:16.464
My Adeline

33:24.851 --> 33:27.390
For you I pine

33:27.490 --> 33:30.160
For you I pine

33:30.836 --> 33:31.999
In all...

33:32.099 --> 33:33.377
That bunch of sissies!

33:33.477 --> 33:36.959
Supposed to be a gun club,
not a blasted singing society!

33:37.059 --> 33:39.361
Make mine with plain water.
Never mind the ice.

33:39.461 --> 33:42.398
Ought to expel them all from
the club, the bunch of coeds.

33:42.498 --> 33:44.510
Sweet Adeline...

33:44.610 --> 33:47.085
Never mind the ice,
just plain water.

33:47.829 --> 33:49.290
Thank you so much.

33:49.621 --> 33:50.963
Bang, bang!

33:51.766 --> 33:53.791
What are you laughing at?
Never touched them.

33:53.891 --> 33:55.650
Is that so? Bang, bang!

33:55.750 --> 33:57.538
I suppose you never
touched them that time?

33:57.638 --> 33:59.011
The left one got away.

33:59.111 --> 34:01.859
"The left one got away." You
ought to have your eyes examined.

34:01.959 --> 34:03.552
Toss up
a couple of crackers, George.

34:03.652 --> 34:04.652
Yes, sir.

34:07.222 --> 34:08.223
Ready?

34:09.078 --> 34:10.306
Bang, bang!

34:10.406 --> 34:11.806
I suppose I missed them
that time.

34:11.907 --> 34:13.918
Both of them.
I suppose you could do better?

34:14.018 --> 34:16.447
For 50 bucks. Fifty
bucks. Who'll be the judge?

34:16.547 --> 34:18.786
You'll be the judge.
All right. Go ahead!

34:18.887 --> 34:22.369
No, not with that old
blunderbuss. I'll use my own gun.

34:22.469 --> 34:24.771
"You'll be the judge." Get
me a lot of crackers, George.

34:24.871 --> 34:27.684
I'm gonna take this sucker to the
cleaners. "You'll be the judge."

34:27.784 --> 34:29.376
For 50 bucks.
Fifty bucks.

34:29.476 --> 34:31.266
And you'll be the judge.
I'll be the judge.

34:31.367 --> 34:32.944
All right. Go ahead!

34:33.047 --> 34:34.047
Yes, sir.

34:43.353 --> 34:44.813
That's 50 bucks.

34:48.344 --> 34:49.792
I bet you can't do it again.

34:49.891 --> 34:51.938
You're on.
Come on, $50.

34:52.038 --> 34:54.610
$50.
Yeah, bang, bang!

34:55.129 --> 34:56.438
Bang, bang!

34:57.242 --> 34:59.462
Wait a minute!
You're using real shells!

34:59.562 --> 35:01.921
What did you think
I was using? Birdseed?

35:02.021 --> 35:04.099
Well, wait a minute.
Two can play at that game.

35:04.199 --> 35:06.405
Why, certainly.
It's lots of fun.

35:06.505 --> 35:07.684
Toss them up, George!

35:07.784 --> 35:10.118
I wouldn't do that
if I was you, gentlemens.

35:10.218 --> 35:12.901
The conductor's apt
to get a little irritated.

35:13.001 --> 35:14.927
Will you toss
those crackers up?

35:15.161 --> 35:16.161
Yes, sir.

35:22.490 --> 35:24.840
Wait a minute! You weren't
supposed to shoot that time.

35:24.940 --> 35:26.727
All right.
It's my turn this time.

35:26.827 --> 35:28.168
All right. $50.

35:28.268 --> 35:30.534
I wouldn't do that
if I were you, gentlemens.

35:30.634 --> 35:32.034
You apt to do some damage.

35:32.134 --> 35:34.693
Will you toss them up
or am I gonna toss you up?

35:34.793 --> 35:37.299
No, sir. I mean, yes, sir.

35:43.227 --> 35:45.528
Good night, ladies

35:45.628 --> 35:46.725
Good night, ladies

35:46.825 --> 35:47.845
What was that noise?

35:47.945 --> 35:50.152
We're going to leave you now

35:50.252 --> 35:52.230
Merrily we roll along

35:52.330 --> 35:54.886
Roll along, roll along

35:54.986 --> 35:56.453
What?
Trapshooting!

35:56.553 --> 35:58.166
Come on!
Go!

36:05.980 --> 36:07.737
Gentlemen,
remember where you are!

36:15.357 --> 36:17.976
I wouldn't do that
if I was you, gentlemens.

36:18.781 --> 36:20.090
I wouldn't do...

36:24.062 --> 36:25.834
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!

36:25.934 --> 36:28.089
Remember we have a lady
as our guest.

36:30.845 --> 36:32.122
Gentlemen!

36:32.799 --> 36:35.897
Gentlemen, if I were you...
Why don't you wait till you...

36:37.438 --> 36:38.813
Gentlemen, please!

37:02.143 --> 37:03.144
Sorry.

37:34.146 --> 37:35.124
Oh!

37:35.224 --> 37:37.176
I'm terribly sorry.

37:38.113 --> 37:40.489
I hope I didn't hurt you.
That's quite all right.

37:40.589 --> 37:43.260
Just pick off any little
pieces you see, will you?

37:43.970 --> 37:47.036
Oh, I'm so sorry.
This is awful.

37:48.418 --> 37:51.598
Oh, dear. I can't tell
you how sorry I am.

37:51.698 --> 37:53.552
Don't mention it.
I break them all the time.

37:53.652 --> 37:54.765
Were you
climbing upstairs there?

37:54.865 --> 37:56.013
Well, I was. Yes.

37:56.113 --> 37:57.106
Just a minute, I'll help you.

37:57.206 --> 37:58.667
Well, you're much too kind.

37:58.767 --> 38:00.444
Quiet!
Yes.

38:05.762 --> 38:07.372
Now, you put one foot here
and one foot there

38:07.472 --> 38:08.654
and you'll be up in a jiffy.

38:08.754 --> 38:11.116
I'd gladly trade berths with you,
but mine has already been slept in.

38:11.216 --> 38:14.033
No, I wouldn't dream of it. You've been
much too kind already. Thank you so much.

38:14.133 --> 38:15.133
Quiet!

38:17.828 --> 38:18.812
Is that right?

38:18.912 --> 38:20.942
Well, you're standing on my
hand, but otherwise it's perfect.

38:21.042 --> 38:22.288
I'm so sorry.

38:22.388 --> 38:24.015
Don't mention it.
You're light as a feather.

38:24.115 --> 38:25.646
Thank you. Good night.
Good night.

38:25.746 --> 38:27.057
One there.
Yeah.

38:27.157 --> 38:28.432
One over there.
Yeah.

38:28.532 --> 38:29.628
Heave ho.

38:32.549 --> 38:34.672
Would you mind
giving my foot a little push?

38:34.772 --> 38:35.935
Well, gladly.

38:38.373 --> 38:39.373
There.

38:43.205 --> 38:44.547
Thank you so much.

38:45.093 --> 38:46.353
Is something the matter?

38:46.453 --> 38:48.306
Nothing at all.
Everything is fine, thank you.

38:48.406 --> 38:50.145
Good night.
Good night.

38:52.485 --> 38:53.469
She's gone!
Who?

38:53.569 --> 38:54.524
Who's gone?
Our guest!

38:54.624 --> 38:55.826
Let's organize a posse.

38:55.926 --> 38:56.902
Hooray!

38:57.002 --> 38:58.096
Where's the dogs?

38:58.196 --> 39:00.369
You can't have a posse
without the dogs.

39:00.469 --> 39:01.796
Hooray!

39:02.182 --> 39:03.506
A hunting we will go

39:03.606 --> 39:05.103
A hunting we will go

39:05.203 --> 39:06.866
Heigh ho, the dairy-o

39:06.966 --> 39:08.477
A hunting we will go

39:10.246 --> 39:11.970
A hunting we will go

39:13.862 --> 39:15.570
A hunting we will go

39:15.670 --> 39:17.361
A hunting we will go

39:17.461 --> 39:19.137
A hunting we will go

39:21.287 --> 39:23.156
There's a posse
going through the train.

39:23.256 --> 39:25.266
A posse?
I knew it! I knew it!

39:25.366 --> 39:26.336
Come on, Al.

39:26.436 --> 39:27.805
A hunting we will go

39:29.992 --> 39:31.026
A hunting we will go

39:31.126 --> 39:32.788
Heigh ho, the dairy-o

39:32.888 --> 39:34.301
A hunting we will go

39:36.200 --> 39:37.629
A hunting we will go

39:39.464 --> 39:40.925
A hunting we will go

39:41.416 --> 39:42.864
A hunting we will go

39:42.964 --> 39:44.611
A hunting we will go

39:45.065 --> 39:46.422
Heigh ho, the dairy-o

39:46.522 --> 39:48.032
A hunting we will go

39:48.937 --> 39:50.612
Those are my favorite dogs.
Go on!

39:50.712 --> 39:52.737
Hey, fellas!
They found something!

39:53.193 --> 39:54.259
A hunting we will go

39:54.359 --> 39:55.443
A hunting we will go

39:55.543 --> 39:56.756
What's going on here?

39:56.856 --> 39:59.249
What's going on here?
Get back to your car!

39:59.349 --> 40:01.298
Who are you? You're expelled!
Get back to your car!

40:01.398 --> 40:03.509
Or I'll call the engine crew
and have you all locked up!

40:03.609 --> 40:05.666
Who brought those dogs in
here? Get them out of here!

40:06.825 --> 40:09.942
Who fired that shot? Don't
you know that's a misdemeanor?

40:10.042 --> 40:12.596
Get back to your car or I'll wire
ahead and have you all locked up!

40:12.696 --> 40:15.464
Now, get out of here! Get
back to your car! Come on!

40:17.130 --> 40:19.447
Get them out of here!
Get them out of here!

40:19.547 --> 40:22.148
Go on! Get them out of here!
Come on, get going.

40:23.530 --> 40:25.075
A hunting we will go

40:25.175 --> 40:26.788
A hunting we will go

40:27.242 --> 40:28.885
A hunting we will go

40:28.985 --> 40:30.549
Heigh ho, the dairy-o

40:30.649 --> 40:31.863
A hunting we will go

40:31.963 --> 40:33.289
Are you all right?

40:34.027 --> 40:35.784
Fine. Thank you.

40:38.220 --> 40:39.830
Heigh ho, the dairy-o

40:39.930 --> 40:41.476
A hunting we will go

40:42.700 --> 40:44.116
Heigh ho, the dairy-o

40:44.216 --> 40:46.059
A hunting we will go

40:47.371 --> 40:49.398
A hunting we will go

40:49.498 --> 40:51.256
A hunting we will go

40:51.356 --> 40:53.282
A hunting we will go

40:54.956 --> 40:56.664
A hunting we will go

40:56.764 --> 40:58.073
Heigh ho, the dairy-o

40:58.173 --> 40:59.255
Oh, you will, will you?

40:59.355 --> 41:02.553
I'll show you! This is
one trip you'll remember!

41:02.653 --> 41:04.026
A hunting we will go

41:04.126 --> 41:06.149
Heigh ho, the dairy-o

41:09.229 --> 41:11.098
A hunting we will go

41:11.198 --> 41:12.642
A hunting we will go

41:14.125 --> 41:15.096
Hey!

41:15.196 --> 41:17.899
Hey, come back!

41:20.270 --> 41:22.604
Hey! Hey!
Come back!

42:04.496 --> 42:06.489
No, ma'am. What do you mean
my clothes aren't there?

42:06.589 --> 42:09.277
They're in Stateroom B, in the
private car behind the diner.

42:09.377 --> 42:12.508
The club car, with my ticket, my
handbag, my lipstick and everything.

42:12.608 --> 42:14.521
No, ma'am. "No, ma'am."
You just didn't look.

42:14.621 --> 42:16.985
Yes, ma'am, I looked, but I didn't
see it 'cause it wasn't there.

42:17.085 --> 42:19.066
That's why I didn't see it.
I suppose it just blew up?

42:19.166 --> 42:20.251
No, ma'am, we set it out.

42:20.351 --> 42:21.661
You set it out?
Yes, ma'am.

42:21.761 --> 42:24.218
The conductor kind of got riled
up with them, so he just set it out

42:24.318 --> 42:27.102
on a siding in Rockingham
Hamlet for them to cool off.

42:27.202 --> 42:29.372
A very pretty little city.
Never mind the geography.

42:29.472 --> 42:32.029
Where's the conductor? He get off
at Rawley. That's where he lives.

42:32.129 --> 42:33.212
Just a little ways out.

42:33.312 --> 42:35.167
Dining car in the rear. A
very pretty countryside there.

42:35.267 --> 42:36.730
You don't seem to understand.
My clothes are lost...

42:36.830 --> 42:37.948
Last call for breakfast...
Shut up.

42:38.048 --> 42:39.359
Yes, ma'am.
No, ma'am, they ain't lost.

42:39.459 --> 42:41.819
Nothing ever gets lost on a
Pullman. They safe, all right.

42:41.919 --> 42:44.126
I recollect one time
a lady left a whole pile of...

42:44.226 --> 42:46.715
I just want to get into my
clothes. You can't do that.

42:46.815 --> 42:48.639
What do I go around in,
a blanket like an Indian?

42:48.739 --> 42:51.454
I got a brown overcoat. Oh,
well, that's very kind of you.

42:51.554 --> 42:52.546
Hello.
Hello.

42:52.646 --> 42:53.757
What are you doing
for breakfast?

42:53.857 --> 42:55.680
Well, if you don't ask me
I won't be doing much.

42:55.780 --> 42:57.602
And if you do ask me,
it might make quite a scandal.

42:57.702 --> 42:59.041
Lady lose her clothes.

42:59.141 --> 43:01.376
You lost your clothes.
Why, that's terrible.

43:01.476 --> 43:03.902
And my ticket, and my bag,
and my shoes, and my makeup,

43:04.002 --> 43:06.241
my toothbrush.
Only, I don't think I had one.

43:06.341 --> 43:07.584
This is disgraceful.
I'll certainly write

43:07.684 --> 43:08.830
to the president
of the company.

43:08.930 --> 43:11.168
How could such a thing happen?
I don't know.

43:11.268 --> 43:14.464
My things seem to have gotten into
a car back there somewhere, somehow,

43:14.564 --> 43:16.509
and now the car
just doesn't seem to be there.

43:16.609 --> 43:18.848
Not that car full of drunks I
hope that they had to disconnect?

43:18.948 --> 43:20.063
Oh, perish the thought.

43:20.163 --> 43:23.232
Well, as soon as we come to a town, I
could jump over to a store and jump back.

43:23.332 --> 43:25.791
With a Mother Hubbard.
Well, that's very kind of you.

43:25.891 --> 43:28.480
In the meantime, I suppose I'll
have to lie here in this hatrack.

43:28.580 --> 43:31.583
Anyway, I haven't any money for you
to jump over to a store and back with.

43:31.683 --> 43:32.767
Oh, I have money.

43:32.867 --> 43:33.983
Oh, you have?
Oh, yes.

43:34.083 --> 43:36.833
Now, if you could just get over to
the store to pick out what you need...

43:36.933 --> 43:38.592
We got a stretcher
in the baggage car up ahead.

43:38.692 --> 43:41.824
Wouldn't that be stretching
it a little? Wait a minute.

43:41.924 --> 43:44.960
Maybe we could borrow some odd pieces
here and there among the lady passengers.

43:45.060 --> 43:46.273
Oh, murder.
That's a wonderful idea.

43:46.373 --> 43:48.286
You take that side and I'll
take this side. Yes, sir.

43:48.386 --> 43:49.934
And I'll take the neck.

43:58.742 --> 44:00.767
Here, we've got some more,
or are you satisfied?

44:00.867 --> 44:02.282
Satisfied?

44:07.574 --> 44:09.681
I could lend you
my earrings.

44:18.231 --> 44:20.053
Good morning.
Good morning.

44:24.792 --> 44:27.713
Oh, why, that's lovely. Now
you won't need anything else.

44:27.813 --> 44:29.556
That's what you think.

44:33.913 --> 44:35.075
Yes, ma'am.

44:35.175 --> 44:38.626
If there's one thing I admire, it's a woman
who can whip up something out of nothing.

44:38.726 --> 44:40.258
You should taste my popovers.

44:40.358 --> 44:41.475
I'd love to.

44:41.575 --> 44:43.716
The homely virtues are so
hard to find these days.

44:43.816 --> 44:47.202
A woman who can sew and cook and bake,
even if she doesn't have to, and knit and...

44:47.302 --> 44:49.060
And weave.
You're joking.

44:49.160 --> 44:51.521
But I mean, seriously,
that is a woman.

44:51.621 --> 44:52.933
Were you going to buy me
some breakfast,

44:53.033 --> 44:55.490
or would you like me to bake you
something right here at the table?

44:55.590 --> 44:58.425
I like a witty woman, too.
Now, what will you have?

44:58.553 --> 45:00.773
The 35-cent breakfast seems
the best at first glance,

45:00.873 --> 45:03.843
but if you analyze it for solid
value, the 55-cent is the one.

45:03.943 --> 45:05.891
Well, I wouldn't want
to impose.

45:05.991 --> 45:07.490
No, feel free
to choose anything you like.

45:07.590 --> 45:09.862
There's even a 75-cent
breakfast if it appeals to you.

45:09.962 --> 45:12.355
We might share one.
Wait a minute.

45:12.455 --> 45:14.532
With two eggs, toast,
and choice of fruit thrown in,

45:14.632 --> 45:18.052
I'm not sure the 75-cent breakfast
isn't the best value after all.

45:18.152 --> 45:19.269
Do we dare?

45:19.369 --> 45:21.829
I'm not really the way you think
I am. It's just my upbringing.

45:21.929 --> 45:23.305
Oh, waiter.
Yes, sir.

45:23.405 --> 45:25.160
Two 75-cent breakfasts,
please.

45:25.260 --> 45:27.879
I'll start with a prairie
oyster. Yes, ma'am.

45:27.979 --> 45:30.183
It's a very tempting choice
in the $1.10 breakfast.

45:30.283 --> 45:31.560
Two 75-cent breakfasts,

45:31.660 --> 45:33.767
and I'll start with a prairie
oyster also, whatever it is.

45:33.867 --> 45:36.072
Make mine on the half-shell.
Yes, sir.

45:36.172 --> 45:39.319
Prairie oysters is Ã  la carte.
All right, all right.

45:39.643 --> 45:41.799
They always get
the best of you somehow.

45:41.899 --> 45:43.688
Now, you say you have
no ticket? That's right.

45:43.788 --> 45:46.694
Naturally, I can't buy you a ticket. I
mean, a perfectly strange young woman.

45:46.794 --> 45:48.936
Naturally. In the first
place, you wouldn't accept it

45:49.036 --> 45:50.890
and in the second place...
There's the expense.

45:50.990 --> 45:52.680
I wasn't actually
thinking of that.

45:52.780 --> 45:54.343
Now, I get off
at Jacksonville.

45:54.443 --> 45:57.129
I guess I do, too, unless
they throw me off sooner.

45:57.229 --> 45:58.953
Suppose we go to a little
store in Jacksonville

45:59.053 --> 46:00.453
and buy you
the few little things you need

46:00.553 --> 46:02.469
and then you come the rest
of the way with me by boat?

46:02.569 --> 46:05.030
You won't have had to accept a
ticket from somebody you don't know,

46:05.130 --> 46:07.045
but you'll still get to where
you're going. How's that?

46:07.145 --> 46:10.101
I don't have to row, do I?
Two prairie oysters.

46:43.072 --> 46:46.122
Oh, very nice. Let's have
that one, too. How much is it?

46:46.222 --> 46:48.681
That is $212.50, monsieur.

46:48.781 --> 46:50.622
We'll take it.
We'll take it.

46:52.672 --> 46:56.268
I didn't expect you to buy me all this
stuff. I really don't think I can accept it.

46:56.368 --> 46:59.403
If you'd just get me a dress
and some shoes and a hat and...

46:59.503 --> 47:01.612
Really more in the nature
of a loan. Nonsense.

47:01.712 --> 47:03.177
It's cheaper in the end
to buy good quality

47:03.277 --> 47:05.102
and enough of them so that
you don't wear them out.

47:05.202 --> 47:06.444
They last longer,
they look better,

47:06.544 --> 47:08.554
and there's a certain pleasure
to having a change.

47:08.654 --> 47:10.680
Well, that's awfully kind
of you.

47:11.296 --> 47:13.705
Are you sure you can
afford all this? I think so.

47:13.805 --> 47:16.280
We haven't done anything
very extravagant yet.

47:16.448 --> 47:18.922
Well, I'd hate to have you
end up on a chain gang.

47:19.022 --> 47:21.399
I think
we're still perfectly safe.

47:23.521 --> 47:26.302
You're really sure it's
all right? Oh, certainly.

47:26.402 --> 47:27.850
You're not a burglar
or something?

47:27.950 --> 47:29.516
Oh, no, that was
my grandfather.

47:29.616 --> 47:31.595
At least that's what
they called him.

47:31.695 --> 47:33.216
Oh, yes.

47:53.764 --> 47:55.673
Do you like this one?

47:57.252 --> 47:58.812
Oh, it's lovely.

47:59.492 --> 48:01.102
But aren't the sleeves
a little short?

48:01.202 --> 48:02.701
Oh, that is for the bracelet,
monsieur.

48:02.801 --> 48:04.813
That is what we call
the bracelet length.

48:04.913 --> 48:06.972
Would you like a bracelet?

48:09.252 --> 48:11.408
Well, what kind of a
bracelet do you mean?

48:11.508 --> 48:12.703
Any kind you like.

48:12.996 --> 48:14.990
You mean with stones?
Certainly with stones.

48:15.090 --> 48:16.914
They are all the rage.

48:17.014 --> 48:18.736
Why not? What kind
of stones do you like?

48:18.836 --> 48:21.668
Well...
Red. That is all the rage.

48:21.988 --> 48:23.437
You mean like garnets?

48:23.537 --> 48:26.372
Don't you think garnets
are a little lifeless?

48:30.628 --> 48:32.849
Why, certainly,
this is great fun.

48:32.949 --> 48:35.822
I've never bought things for a girl
before. I mean, in any such quantities.

48:35.922 --> 48:39.804
You've been denying yourself, monsieur,
one of the basic pleasures in life.

48:39.973 --> 48:41.402
I guess I have.

48:44.102 --> 48:45.744
All right.
Plus tax.

48:45.844 --> 48:47.790
Yes, it's these taxes
that get you down.

48:47.890 --> 48:49.747
I keep feeling that two
men with butterfly nets

48:49.847 --> 48:52.336
are going to creep up
behind you and lead you away.

48:52.436 --> 48:53.650
You're thinking of my uncle.

48:53.750 --> 48:56.144
I'm not the crazy one in the
family. I'm perfectly normal.

48:56.244 --> 48:58.640
Then why do you travel around
in a lower berth?

48:58.740 --> 49:00.306
I find it a little stuffy
in an upper.

49:00.406 --> 49:02.385
Oh, you mean why don't
I take a stateroom? Yes.

49:02.485 --> 49:04.195
Staterooms are un-American.

49:05.128 --> 49:07.957
Well, thank you.
Don't mention it.

49:08.057 --> 49:10.706
And now, if you can't think of
anything else, we'd better get started.

49:10.806 --> 49:11.783
Just charge everything,
please,

49:11.883 --> 49:14.099
and have it put in the
taxi. Good day. Excuse me.

49:14.199 --> 49:15.794
Oh, I'm so sorry. Forgive me.

49:15.894 --> 49:17.522
I'm so used to buying
in stores where I'm known

49:17.622 --> 49:18.868
that it totally
slipped my mind.

49:18.968 --> 49:22.100
Mr... That's all
right, don't mention it.

49:22.200 --> 49:24.275
Excuse me, please, that
I didn't... Good day.

49:24.375 --> 49:26.802
Well, what are you
standing there for?

49:26.902 --> 49:29.906
Where are the packages?
How about some service?

49:30.006 --> 49:33.604
Why do I got to do
everything myself?

49:44.234 --> 49:46.195
Is this yours?
Oh, yes.

49:46.295 --> 49:48.307
Actually, it was my grandfather's,
but he didn't like it.

49:48.407 --> 49:50.710
He only used it once.
This was his hat.

49:50.810 --> 49:53.014
Do you happen to remember how
much tip I gave the taxi driver?

49:53.114 --> 49:57.538
Well, I didn't see the coin, but from
his face, I think it was 10 cents.

49:57.770 --> 49:59.593
Tipping is un-American.

50:01.611 --> 50:03.945
What's your name?
Hackensacker.

50:05.130 --> 50:06.968
Not John D. Hackensacker?

50:07.068 --> 50:11.030
Oh, I'm not my grandfather, of course.
He's dead, anyway. I'm John D. The Third.

50:11.130 --> 50:13.270
Well, then, you're one of
the richest men in the world.

50:13.370 --> 50:15.046
Well, yes, I suppose so.

50:15.147 --> 50:17.205
I would step on your face.

50:17.305 --> 50:18.837
That's quite all right.
I rather enjoyed it.

50:18.937 --> 50:21.509
Twice.
You made quite an impression.

50:22.059 --> 50:24.279
May I get you a rug, madam?
Oh, no, thank you.

50:24.379 --> 50:27.479
Will you dine on deck, Mr.
Hackensacker, or in the saloon?

50:27.579 --> 50:30.900
We can have it on deck if you like, but
it blows everything all over the place.

50:31.000 --> 50:32.793
There are a lot of
inconveniences to yachting

50:32.893 --> 50:34.486
that most people
don't know anything about.

50:34.586 --> 50:36.280
Give me the peaceful train.

50:36.380 --> 50:37.754
In the saloon, please.

50:37.854 --> 50:38.949
Very good, madam.

50:40.652 --> 50:41.814
You see what I mean?

50:41.914 --> 50:44.023
I just happen to own this
thing or I'd never go near it.

50:44.123 --> 50:46.425
Did you say you were John
D. The Third or the Fourth?

50:46.525 --> 50:49.029
The Third. The Fourth will
be my son when I marry.

50:50.221 --> 50:53.719
Well, then it really didn't mean anything
to you to buy me all those things, did it?

50:53.819 --> 50:55.862
Well, I can't pretend
that it was a great sacrifice,

50:55.962 --> 50:57.527
but it did give me
a great deal of pleasure.

50:57.627 --> 50:59.352
You like to write
in your little book.

50:59.452 --> 51:00.600
It used to please
my grandfather.

51:00.700 --> 51:02.490
It's just a habit.
It's nonsense, really.

51:02.590 --> 51:04.696
I write things down,
but I never add them up.

51:04.796 --> 51:06.489
Where are you staying
in Palm Beach?

51:06.589 --> 51:08.428
Oh, no place yet.

51:08.749 --> 51:10.970
Where are you staying?
At my sister's.

51:11.070 --> 51:13.943
Oh, yes, the Princess.
Or is it the Duchess?

51:14.043 --> 51:15.258
The Princess Centimillia.

51:15.358 --> 51:16.837
Of course.

51:17.390 --> 51:20.293
What are you going to
Palm Beach for? A divorce.

51:21.935 --> 51:23.325
Well, you needn't look
so sour about it.

51:23.425 --> 51:25.660
Your sister's been divorced
five times, hasn't she?

51:25.760 --> 51:28.573
No, no, three,
she was annulled twice.

51:28.673 --> 51:30.908
Well, I've never been
divorced before. Good.

51:31.008 --> 51:32.731
By the way, what is your name?

51:32.831 --> 51:35.182
Oh, Jeffers.
Geraldine Jeffers.

51:35.567 --> 51:37.290
Was he brutal to you?

51:37.872 --> 51:40.107
Oh, not particularly.

51:40.207 --> 51:41.499
A drunkard, huh?

51:41.599 --> 51:44.316
No, not congenital,
or anything like that.

51:44.416 --> 51:46.620
Women always protect the
man they've been married to.

51:46.720 --> 51:48.633
Yes, I suppose
it's human nature.

51:48.733 --> 51:50.266
Did he beat you?

51:50.366 --> 51:51.879
Not often.

51:51.984 --> 51:53.244
The hound.

51:53.344 --> 51:56.891
Oh, a man's a man, I suppose. They're
all tarred with the same brush.

51:56.991 --> 52:00.254
How brave you are. When I
marry, there'll be no divorce.

52:00.354 --> 52:01.785
That's why I've been
a little cautious.

52:01.885 --> 52:03.801
You're afraid somebody
will marry you for your money.

52:03.901 --> 52:06.491
Oh, I expect that. When money
reaches certain proportions,

52:06.591 --> 52:08.415
you can't ignore it any more
than you can a...

52:08.515 --> 52:09.855
A horse in a bedroom.

52:09.955 --> 52:12.060
I wasn't thinking exactly
of that, but it'll serve.

52:12.160 --> 52:14.845
I see marriage as a
sort of permanent welding,

52:14.945 --> 52:16.318
a growing together
of two trees,

52:16.418 --> 52:18.751
in spite of anything my sister
can demonstrate to the contrary,

52:18.851 --> 52:20.860
into a sort of
permanent mess... Mass.

52:20.960 --> 52:25.005
Like a permanent grafting of
two trees into a permanent graft.

52:25.171 --> 52:27.099
Oh, that one's too easy.

52:27.199 --> 52:29.148
Oh, you mean
a permanent graft.

52:29.248 --> 52:30.332
I get it.

52:30.432 --> 52:32.607
But it doesn't have to be.
It can be very nice, I'm sure.

52:32.707 --> 52:34.081
Oh, it can be.

52:34.181 --> 52:36.928
And after the divorce,
you have plans? Oh, yes.

52:37.028 --> 52:39.231
Anybody I know? I know almost
everybody in Palm Beach.

52:39.331 --> 52:41.153
Oh, no,
I haven't picked him out yet.

52:41.253 --> 52:44.669
Just some very rich man.
Some very rich man?

52:44.769 --> 52:46.684
Oh, I wasn't thinking
of anyone as rich as you.

52:46.784 --> 52:47.933
That might get to be annoying.

52:48.033 --> 52:49.532
It is.
Is it?

52:49.632 --> 52:52.270
No, I just meant
somebody who's well-fixed.

52:53.012 --> 52:56.575
And who could spare the $99,000
without missing it too much.

52:56.675 --> 52:59.231
I'm not quite sure I
understand about the $99,000.

52:59.331 --> 53:02.593
Well, you see, he just
happens to need $99,000,

53:02.693 --> 53:04.832
and after all, I don't see any
reason why he shouldn't get it

53:04.932 --> 53:06.047
if I'm throwing it
out the windows.

53:06.147 --> 53:07.645
This is your last husband
you're talking about?

53:07.745 --> 53:09.855
Yes. He wants to sell you for $99,000.

53:09.955 --> 53:12.064
Oh, no, no. I don't think
he had any such idea at all.

53:12.164 --> 53:13.408
Well, what do you call it?

53:13.508 --> 53:16.477
Well, I mean, after all...
He's entitled to something.

53:16.577 --> 53:20.258
I mean, he did protect me and
give me food, such as it was,

53:20.358 --> 53:22.432
and clothes, such as they
were, for a few years and...

53:22.532 --> 53:25.439
And now if I can repay... But the
man is a vermin. No court of law...

53:25.539 --> 53:27.842
Don't you think I'm worth $99,000?
That has nothing to do with it.

53:27.942 --> 53:30.049
You're probably worth that,
twice that, three times,

53:30.149 --> 53:32.387
but even so, the days of
serfdom... I mean, bondage...

53:32.487 --> 53:34.496
I mean, the days you bought
a wife for a cow are over.

53:34.596 --> 53:36.257
I've never heard of
such a thing. I...

53:36.357 --> 53:38.797
Chivalry is not only dead,
it's decomposed.

53:39.158 --> 53:41.028
Well, how much
did this yacht cost you?

53:41.128 --> 53:43.298
That is entirely beside the
point. A woman is not a vessel.

53:43.398 --> 53:45.252
I mean, of all the filthy
things I've heard in my life,

53:45.352 --> 53:46.946
I still...
How does he want it?

53:47.046 --> 53:48.993
In cash, maybe?
In cash.

53:49.093 --> 53:51.073
So I won't stop the check,
the scoundrel...

53:51.173 --> 53:52.866
I don't mean me,
I mean that whoever's...

53:52.966 --> 53:56.449
Well, I don't think he'll ever
get it. It was just an idea.

53:56.549 --> 53:58.307
There is a name
for such reptiles,

53:58.407 --> 54:00.833
but I won't sully this sweet
ocean breeze by mentioning it.

54:00.933 --> 54:04.704
I may not be exactly in the best of
shape, but if ever I meet this Mr. Jeffers,

54:04.804 --> 54:06.369
I'll thrash him
within an inch of his life.

54:06.469 --> 54:08.481
Oh, well, then I hope
you never meet him.

54:08.581 --> 54:09.876
I suppose he's large?

54:09.976 --> 54:11.456
Well, he's not small.

54:11.556 --> 54:13.090
That's one of
the tragedies of this life.

54:13.190 --> 54:15.104
That the men who are
most in need of a beating-up,

54:15.204 --> 54:16.883
are always enormous.

54:24.184 --> 54:27.428
She's a tall, dark-haired girl with big
eyes. Yes, I know who you talking about.

54:27.528 --> 54:29.220
You mean the young lady
who lose all her clothes.

54:29.320 --> 54:30.369
Lost all her clothes?

54:30.469 --> 54:33.345
Yes, sir, but we fix her up with a
blanket when she got off at Jacksonville.

54:33.445 --> 54:34.660
She got off at Jacksonville?
Yes, sir.

54:34.760 --> 54:35.779
Alone?

54:35.879 --> 54:37.605
Well, you might
practically say she was alone.

54:37.705 --> 54:41.122
The gentleman that got off with her gave
me 10 cents from New York to Jacksonville.

54:41.222 --> 54:43.748
Watch your step, lady. She's
alone, but she don't know it.

54:43.848 --> 54:46.086
Well, never mind the philosophy.
Then she's at Jacksonville?

54:46.186 --> 54:47.178
Yes, sir. No, sir.

54:47.278 --> 54:50.147
She said that he said he was gonna
take her down there on his boat.

54:50.247 --> 54:51.941
I suppose she means yacht,

54:52.041 --> 54:54.375
but I don't see how no
gentleman can give me a dime

54:54.475 --> 54:56.808
from New York to Jacksonville
can have a yacht.

54:56.908 --> 55:00.688
Maybe a canoe or a bicycle.
Yes, sir.

55:20.540 --> 55:23.639
Hey, let me use these a
minute, will you? Surely.

55:43.100 --> 55:44.824
Thanks.
Any time.

55:48.957 --> 55:51.608
I think you'll like Palm Beach
very much.

55:53.374 --> 55:54.584
Yoo-hoo!

55:59.390 --> 56:00.839
Who's that?

56:00.939 --> 56:02.071
Oh, that's my sister,
the Princess.

56:02.302 --> 56:03.880
Hello, Maude.
Hello, Snoodles.

56:03.980 --> 56:06.186
Where'd you get the
pretty girl? Greetings.

56:06.286 --> 56:07.928
She calls me Snoodles.

56:08.447 --> 56:09.578
Is that the Prince?

56:09.678 --> 56:12.520
No, the Prince is all washed
up. This is something new.

56:12.620 --> 56:13.673
It might be a duke.

56:13.773 --> 56:16.011
It might be her tailor, too.
She goes out with anything.

56:16.111 --> 56:18.056
Hello, darling. What a
perfectly beautiful dame.

56:18.156 --> 56:20.330
Were you seasick on the way
down? Wherever did you find her?

56:20.430 --> 56:22.376
This is Toto. Say, "How do
you do," Toto. Greetings.

56:22.476 --> 56:25.724
Toto's a refugee from his
creditors, I think. Greetings.

56:29.599 --> 56:31.436
Glad to be aboard, sir.
Hello, Maude.

56:31.536 --> 56:33.162
Hello. Glad to see you aboard.
How do you do?

56:33.262 --> 56:34.987
You get prettier as one
gets nearer. Thank you.

56:35.087 --> 56:36.844
How did you manage it?
He's stiffer than a plank.

56:36.944 --> 56:38.252
This must have done him
a power of good.

56:38.352 --> 56:39.499
This is my sister
Maude, Mrs...

56:39.599 --> 56:41.098
Don't tell me he doesn't
even know your name.

56:41.198 --> 56:42.191
This is perfectly marvelous.

56:42.291 --> 56:43.661
Now, tell me
he picked you up on the train

56:43.761 --> 56:45.355
and you'll make me a
happy woman. Greetings.

56:45.455 --> 56:46.732
All right, Toto,
you've said, "How do you do."

56:46.832 --> 56:48.075
Wait till I tell the papers.

56:48.175 --> 56:49.673
You know, Maude, somebody
meeting you for the first time,

56:49.773 --> 56:51.850
not knowing you were cracked, might
get the wrong impression of you.

56:51.950 --> 56:53.228
Did he really pick you up
on the train?

56:53.328 --> 56:55.403
Well, I was in awful trouble
until he nobly came to my rescue.

56:55.503 --> 56:56.523
Oh, now you've spoiled
everything.

56:56.623 --> 56:58.219
I hoped for once
he hadn't done anything noble,

56:58.319 --> 56:59.532
that he was really cooking
with gas.

56:59.632 --> 57:01.389
What a lovely suit.
He bought me this.

57:01.489 --> 57:02.862
Why, Snoodles, you rat!

57:02.962 --> 57:05.420
We'll work this into something
yet. This is perfectly electrifying.

57:05.520 --> 57:07.402
You must come and stay with us
and we'll warm this up.

57:07.502 --> 57:08.588
You're divorced, of course.
No, not quite.

57:08.688 --> 57:11.439
That's marvelous. I don't think I'm
quite through with the Prince yet, either.

57:11.539 --> 57:12.515
We can look
for new husbands together.

57:12.615 --> 57:15.020
I'm thinking of an American at the
moment. It seems more patriotic.

57:15.120 --> 57:16.139
Greetings.
No, no, Toto.

57:16.239 --> 57:17.818
His English
is a little elementary.

57:20.515 --> 57:22.638
What language does he speak?
I don't know.

57:22.738 --> 57:25.099
I think it's Baluchistan,
but it's impossible to tell.

57:25.199 --> 57:26.636
Hello.
Let's go ashore now.

57:26.736 --> 57:29.073
I'll put you in the blue suite
and we'll have a wonderful time.

57:29.173 --> 57:30.734
You're perfectly respectable,
but of course,

57:30.834 --> 57:33.325
as long as we don't roll on the
floor and give the butler hysterics,

57:33.425 --> 57:35.631
we'll be cooking on the front
burner. I talk a lot, don't I?

57:35.731 --> 57:38.781
Yes. Snoodles, you snake in the grass...

57:41.538 --> 57:43.435
Did you have to get him drunk
or how did you do it?

57:43.535 --> 57:45.420
You'll have to tell me
all about it later. Maude.

57:45.520 --> 57:47.469
Look at that very handsome
man. I wonder who he is.

57:47.569 --> 57:49.004
I don't think
I've seen him around before.

57:49.104 --> 57:51.020
I thought I knew all the
handsome men in this village.

57:51.120 --> 57:52.270
We could use some new faces.

57:52.370 --> 57:54.413
Oh, it isn't possible.
What isn't possible?

57:54.513 --> 57:58.242
I think I know that man.
In fact, I'm sure of it.

58:03.875 --> 58:05.454
What did you follow me
down here for, anyway?

58:05.554 --> 58:07.312
What do you mean, what did
I follow you down here for?

58:07.412 --> 58:09.326
You're my wife, aren't you?
You're making an ass of yourself

58:09.426 --> 58:10.673
exposing yourself
to all sorts of dangers

58:10.773 --> 58:12.368
that I promised to love,
honor, and protect you from.

58:12.468 --> 58:14.479
But that isn't fair when you
realize I'm doing this for you, too.

58:14.579 --> 58:15.728
I don't want you
to do any more.

58:15.828 --> 58:17.651
But, look, I've left you.
I'm not your wife any longer.

58:17.751 --> 58:19.183
You're not my husband.
Gerry, darling...

58:19.283 --> 58:22.020
No, no, stop... Well, I
must say you do know him.

58:22.438 --> 58:26.831
This is the Princess Centimillia.
My brother, Captain McGlue.

58:26.931 --> 58:28.593
What? Captain, we should have met sooner

58:28.693 --> 58:30.257
and if I'd seen you around,
we would have.

58:30.357 --> 58:32.401
This is my brother Captain
Hackensacker, Captain McGlue.

58:32.501 --> 58:33.747
That's an odd name.
Yes, isn't it?

58:33.847 --> 58:35.279
How do you do, Captain.
I'm not a captain.

58:35.379 --> 58:36.978
That's my sister's joke
because I own a yacht.

58:37.078 --> 58:39.056
That's my sister's joke
because I don't own one.

58:39.156 --> 58:40.149
Very glad to meet you.

58:40.249 --> 58:41.777
Your sister didn't tell me
she had a brother here.

58:41.877 --> 58:43.824
No, I just dropped over...
You're staying with us, of course.

58:43.924 --> 58:45.268
No, we wouldn't want
to inconvenience you.

58:45.368 --> 58:46.546
We'll go to a hotel.
No, but, Mac...

58:46.646 --> 58:49.039
Inconvenience us? Bumble puppy.
We practically run a hotel, anyway.

58:49.139 --> 58:51.892
This will give the servants some
exercise. I won't take no for an answer.

58:51.992 --> 58:53.235
Your brother's
a very fine looking man.

58:53.335 --> 58:54.897
You know
you look exactly alike.

58:54.997 --> 58:56.113
I suppose he's married.

58:56.213 --> 58:57.680
No, no, he's entirely free.

58:57.780 --> 58:58.802
You don't tell me.
Now, look.

58:58.902 --> 58:59.895
Don't pay any attention
to her, Captain,

58:59.995 --> 59:02.163
her bark is worse than her
bite. That's what you think.

59:02.263 --> 59:04.176
Oh, dear, I wish I hadn't
brought Toto along today.

59:04.276 --> 59:07.093
Somebody think of an errand
to send him on.

59:07.193 --> 59:09.331
Hello.
Toto, this is Captain McGlue.

59:09.431 --> 59:11.857
I'm going to see more of him
and less of you from now on.

59:11.957 --> 59:13.813
Hello.
Listen carefully, dear.

59:13.913 --> 59:17.491
I left my handkerchief on the
yacht. You go fetch it, see?

59:17.591 --> 59:18.992
Nitz.
Yitz, Toto.

59:19.092 --> 59:21.732
Nitz.
It'll be nitz to you, Toto.

59:23.977 --> 59:26.695
And now, Captain,
you may take my arm.

59:27.049 --> 59:29.458
What did you say
you were captain of?

59:29.558 --> 59:30.806
I didn't say a word about it.

59:30.906 --> 59:33.395
How wonderful it is meeting
a silent American again.

59:33.495 --> 59:36.339
All my husbands were
foreigners and such chatterboxes

59:36.439 --> 59:38.549
I could hardly get
a word in edgeways.

59:38.649 --> 59:40.918
They make a handsome
couple, don't they? Pardon?

59:41.018 --> 59:43.669
My sister and your brother. It would
be nice if something came of it.

59:43.769 --> 59:46.643
Oh, yes, wouldn't it?

59:46.743 --> 59:48.406
It would be wonderful for him.

59:48.506 --> 59:50.646
Of course, she's no bargain,
but it might happen very easily.

59:50.746 --> 59:52.244
She's a woman
of iron determination

59:52.344 --> 59:54.772
and once her mind is made up,
he might as well yield.

59:54.872 --> 59:56.086
I can see what you mean.

59:56.186 --> 59:58.261
I'm glad you're going to stay
with us and your brother, too.

59:58.361 --> 01:00:00.216
Are you? I don't know
why I didn't think of it

01:00:00.316 --> 01:00:01.307
or maybe I did think of it,

01:00:01.407 --> 01:00:03.671
but it took someone of my sister's
courage to make it come true.

01:00:03.771 --> 01:00:05.813
You're very sweet.
Thank you very much.

01:00:05.913 --> 01:00:08.308
The Captain's a big fellow,
isn't he? Yes, isn't he?

01:00:08.408 --> 01:00:10.934
You look exactly alike.
Yes, don't we?

01:00:11.034 --> 01:00:13.573
You know,
people always remark on it.

01:00:23.083 --> 01:00:24.855
Why don't you marry her?
She's lovely.

01:00:24.955 --> 01:00:26.232
In the first place,
she isn't free yet.

01:00:26.332 --> 01:00:29.048
In the second place, you don't marry
somebody you just met the day before.

01:00:29.148 --> 01:00:30.872
At least I don't.
But that's the only way, dear.

01:00:30.972 --> 01:00:33.144
If you get to know too much about
them, you'd never marry them.

01:00:33.244 --> 01:00:35.385
I'd marry Captain McGlue
tomorrow even with that name.

01:00:35.485 --> 01:00:36.477
And divorce him next month.

01:00:36.577 --> 01:00:39.031
Nothing is permanent in this
world except Roosevelt, dear.

01:00:39.131 --> 01:00:42.006
As a matter of fact, Maude, I'm becoming
very attracted to this young woman,

01:00:42.106 --> 01:00:44.535
more so than anyone I've known
the same length of time.

01:00:44.635 --> 01:00:47.063
But I want to know how she is
early in the morning, late at night,

01:00:47.163 --> 01:00:50.745
rain or shine, under trying circumstances
as when the servants leave in a body.

01:00:50.845 --> 01:00:53.238
How she is with children... What
are you going to do, rent some?

01:00:53.338 --> 01:00:54.456
Why not?
Perhaps we could borrow some.

01:00:54.556 --> 01:00:55.704
You mean a mock marriage?

01:00:55.804 --> 01:00:59.483
I certainly do not. I revere marriage
unlike some people I could mention.

01:00:59.583 --> 01:01:00.664
Oh, here.

01:01:00.764 --> 01:01:04.152
But why "Captain McGlue"
of all the idiotic names?

01:01:04.252 --> 01:01:07.289
Because I want him to build
your airport for you, darling.

01:01:07.389 --> 01:01:09.147
Now he seems to have
something against my husband.

01:01:09.247 --> 01:01:11.224
I don't know why, but
as my brother... Yes.

01:01:11.324 --> 01:01:14.232
Apart from the fact that I wouldn't
even let him build a chicken coop for me,

01:01:14.332 --> 01:01:16.409
I'd still like to know why I'm
to be called Captain McGlue.

01:01:16.509 --> 01:01:18.488
Of all the nincompoopish...
Wasn't that your mother's name?

01:01:18.588 --> 01:01:20.984
What? Captain McGlue?
Really, Geraldine.

01:01:21.084 --> 01:01:23.448
Her name was McGrew.
M-C-G-R-E-W.

01:01:23.548 --> 01:01:26.300
Oh, well, I'm sorry, darling.
I remembered it as McGlue.

01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:28.475
Yes. Well, I guess I'm stuck
with it now.

01:01:28.575 --> 01:01:31.416
Captain McGlue. What am I supposed
to be captain of? A garbage scow?

01:01:31.516 --> 01:01:33.243
No, I just put that in
to make it more dignified.

01:01:33.343 --> 01:01:34.970
Couldn't you have been
a captain in the last war?

01:01:35.070 --> 01:01:38.438
Sure, I was 11 years old at the
finish. A captain in knee britches.

01:01:38.671 --> 01:01:40.665
What about the Boy Scouts?
Wonderful.

01:01:40.765 --> 01:01:43.419
I could go around building bonfires
on the drawing room carpets.

01:01:43.519 --> 01:01:45.628
I'm sorry, darling. I
really meant it for the best.

01:01:45.729 --> 01:01:48.316
I know you did. That's
what's so irritating about it.

01:01:48.416 --> 01:01:49.851
Where'd you get
the brother idea?

01:01:49.951 --> 01:01:51.262
Because you had your arms
around me.

01:01:51.362 --> 01:01:53.819
I suppose no one's ever had his
arms around you except your brother,

01:01:53.919 --> 01:01:54.896
only, you haven't got one.

01:01:54.996 --> 01:01:57.883
I don't suppose Captain Hackensacker
ever put his arms around you.

01:01:57.983 --> 01:01:59.359
Of course not.
Of course not.

01:01:59.459 --> 01:02:01.980
Yachts must have changed since
the last time I was on one.

01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:03.871
That's what
they build yachts for.

01:02:03.971 --> 01:02:07.419
Naturally, he will put his arms
around me when and if we're engaged.

01:02:07.519 --> 01:02:09.085
Oh, we're engaged now, are we?

01:02:09.185 --> 01:02:10.560
Is there anything wrong
with being engaged?

01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:11.773
You ought to know.

01:02:11.873 --> 01:02:13.216
Where'd you get that suit?

01:02:13.316 --> 01:02:15.324
That's what
I was telling you about.

01:02:15.424 --> 01:02:16.670
What's that
you've got on your wrist?

01:02:16.770 --> 01:02:18.624
Just what you think
it is, dear.

01:02:18.724 --> 01:02:20.220
What kind of stones are those?

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:21.917
Exactly what they look like.

01:02:22.017 --> 01:02:24.638
You know what it feels like to
be strangled with bare hands?

01:02:24.738 --> 01:02:26.910
Oh, now,
wait a minute, darling.

01:02:27.010 --> 01:02:30.639
I've always been on the level
with you and I always will be.

01:02:32.404 --> 01:02:34.591
Here.
What's that supposed to be?

01:02:34.691 --> 01:02:37.163
You put that over
on the mantelpiece.

01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:40.841
Lovebirds, huh?

01:02:41.139 --> 01:02:42.815
Now, so long as that's there,

01:02:42.915 --> 01:02:46.079
you won't have the slightest,
smallest thing to be unhappy about.

01:02:46.179 --> 01:02:49.085
That'll be a signal and we'll
never have to mention the subject.

01:02:49.185 --> 01:02:51.165
And that goes for you, too.
Huh?

01:02:51.265 --> 01:02:54.237
And your friend the Princess, you
seem to be cutting such a groove with.

01:02:54.337 --> 01:02:55.389
Princess.

01:02:55.489 --> 01:02:57.762
Say, where'd you get the money
to fly down here, anyway?

01:02:57.862 --> 01:03:01.058
Same place you got yours, only,
I didn't have to kiss him goodbye.

01:03:01.158 --> 01:03:03.051
Oh, the Wienie King.

01:03:03.669 --> 01:03:07.777
He wanted us to get back together, I
guess. Don't you think we owe it to him?

01:03:07.877 --> 01:03:11.009
Look, why don't you let me go out there
and poke that guy in the nose just once?

01:03:11.109 --> 01:03:13.346
Because I've left you,
darling, for both our good.

01:03:13.446 --> 01:03:14.438
Now, just...
Excuse me.

01:03:14.538 --> 01:03:16.770
Mac, did you happen to... You don't
mind if I call you Mac, do you?

01:03:16.870 --> 01:03:18.178
Did you happen to bring
a tuxedo with you?

01:03:18.278 --> 01:03:20.418
I did not. The business I came
here to tend to didn't call for one

01:03:20.518 --> 01:03:22.819
and you can stop pulling my
coat. That's perfectly all right.

01:03:22.919 --> 01:03:25.603
In a pinch you can wear one of mine.
Oh, in a pinch. That's very funny.

01:03:25.703 --> 01:03:27.075
I won't be here that long.
Why, Mac.

01:03:27.175 --> 01:03:29.184
That's too bad, old man. I hoped
you'd spend the season with us.

01:03:29.284 --> 01:03:30.305
I wanted
to get to know you better.

01:03:30.405 --> 01:03:32.740
In any case, there's something I
wanna talk to you about before you go.

01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:34.239
I'm very glad you showed up
just when you did.

01:03:34.339 --> 01:03:35.360
So am I.
Good.

01:03:35.460 --> 01:03:36.927
I needed a male member
of Gerry's family.

01:03:37.027 --> 01:03:38.048
You have him.
Fine.

01:03:38.148 --> 01:03:39.200
Now, I have
a certain thought...

01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:41.183
I have a certain thought also,
and it's that bracelet.

01:03:41.283 --> 01:03:42.946
Mac... I'm very glad
you brought that up.

01:03:43.046 --> 01:03:45.284
Mac is delighted with it,
Snoodles. He shouldn't be.

01:03:45.384 --> 01:03:46.465
He isn't.
Fine.

01:03:46.565 --> 01:03:49.058
The first bracelet my sister got, I
punched the fellow right in the nose.

01:03:49.158 --> 01:03:50.135
Fellow by the name of Wallace.

01:03:50.235 --> 01:03:51.842
I can see we understand
each other perfectly.

01:03:51.942 --> 01:03:54.466
I didn't like it any more than you
do this. You're reading my mind.

01:03:54.566 --> 01:03:56.609
Splendid. But there's a difference
between Wallace and me...

01:03:56.709 --> 01:03:58.112
I'm not interested in Wallace.

01:03:58.212 --> 01:03:59.297
There's no reason
why you should be.

01:03:59.397 --> 01:04:00.675
Now, I, on the other hand...
Now, look.

01:04:00.775 --> 01:04:03.201
If I could trust you two boys
not to slug each other,

01:04:03.301 --> 01:04:05.378
I'd like to make
an exit right about here.

01:04:05.478 --> 01:04:07.361
I feel like a bone
between two dogs.

01:04:07.461 --> 01:04:09.092
Oh, we're going to
get along together, all right.

01:04:09.192 --> 01:04:10.691
There's nothing the matter
with my intentions,

01:04:10.791 --> 01:04:12.226
as Mac will be
the first to admit.

01:04:12.326 --> 01:04:13.859
The only thing that could
possibly embarrass you

01:04:13.959 --> 01:04:17.703
would be the lovely things I want to say
to him about you. Your face, your form.

01:04:17.803 --> 01:04:20.134
Things that a brother is
naturally blind to. Is that so?

01:04:20.234 --> 01:04:22.211
Geraldine's future
and this little plan I have,

01:04:22.311 --> 01:04:23.557
which I'd better discuss
with you before...

01:04:23.657 --> 01:04:25.667
What's buzzing, cousins? What's
the dirt? Never mind now, Maude.

01:04:25.767 --> 01:04:27.429
It's just a little something
I want to discuss with Mac.

01:04:27.529 --> 01:04:30.052
My dear, when you hear what
it is, you will simply expire.

01:04:30.152 --> 01:04:31.129
Maude...

01:04:31.229 --> 01:04:33.350
It's too, too excruciating!
Maude, please.

01:04:33.450 --> 01:04:35.304
He wants a miniature
marriage with you.

01:04:35.404 --> 01:04:37.736
A miniature what? Go away,
Toto. This is not for children.

01:04:37.836 --> 01:04:40.260
You know, everything up to the dissolve
and then good night, sweetheart,

01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:41.925
I'll see you in the morning.
What's this?

01:04:42.025 --> 01:04:44.498
The boy wants to bundle.
Maude!

01:04:45.146 --> 01:04:47.847
And then he's going to make you
cook and sew and wash the windows,

01:04:47.947 --> 01:04:49.509
and then he's going
to get some little brats

01:04:49.609 --> 01:04:51.205
to see if you know how
to change them.

01:04:51.305 --> 01:04:53.543
But how?
He's going to rent them.

01:04:53.643 --> 01:04:54.903
Oh, no.

01:04:55.290 --> 01:04:57.765
Come on, let's you and me go
someplace. They want to be alone.

01:04:57.865 --> 01:04:59.975
But just a minute, I... Oh,
don't take it so seriously.

01:05:00.075 --> 01:05:01.320
They want to bake a cake,
dear.

01:05:01.420 --> 01:05:03.159
They want to bake a...

01:05:05.468 --> 01:05:08.103
I don't know what to say. I
didn't realize it was so humorous.

01:05:08.203 --> 01:05:10.823
Did you really want
to put me through all that?

01:05:10.923 --> 01:05:13.030
I'm afraid I'm... There's no
use trying to conceal it now.

01:05:13.130 --> 01:05:14.311
I might have guessed it
on the train.

01:05:14.411 --> 01:05:16.583
I certainly should have known it
in Jacksonville and on the yacht.

01:05:16.683 --> 01:05:20.296
The trial was as much for you as for me
and however ridiculous I may seem in this,

01:05:20.397 --> 01:05:22.855
nothing ridiculous about
the way I feel in my heart.

01:05:22.955 --> 01:05:24.665
I'm madly in love with you.

01:05:25.853 --> 01:05:27.496
Oh, isn't that pretty?

01:05:27.596 --> 01:05:28.905
Why do you keep bothering
them all the time?

01:05:29.005 --> 01:05:31.378
If you want to
bother somebody, bother me.

01:05:33.405 --> 01:05:35.178
You know, I'm not sure
that Mac likes me.

01:05:35.278 --> 01:05:36.936
Oh, no, no, no,
he's always like that.

01:05:37.036 --> 01:05:40.201
It's just that he doesn't seem to
think anybody's good enough for me.

01:05:40.301 --> 01:05:41.846
Well, he's right there.

01:05:54.431 --> 01:05:56.170
You don't care much for me,
do you?

01:05:56.270 --> 01:05:57.684
Why, certainly.

01:05:57.790 --> 01:05:59.751
Then why do you let me
flop around?

01:05:59.851 --> 01:06:01.595
I'm sorry.

01:06:02.431 --> 01:06:04.327
You will care for me, though.

01:06:04.427 --> 01:06:07.480
I grow on people, like moss.

01:06:09.023 --> 01:06:11.390
Sit down, Toto.
Stop following me around.

01:06:12.736 --> 01:06:15.037
Nitz.
Yitz, Toto.

01:06:29.824 --> 01:06:32.028
Isn't it romantic?

01:06:34.977 --> 01:06:36.847
Oh, you have
a nice little voice.

01:06:36.947 --> 01:06:38.443
Thank you.
I used to sing in college.

01:06:38.543 --> 01:06:41.261
With a mandolin? I wouldn't
play it around the house.

01:06:41.361 --> 01:06:42.670
Would you be around
the house much?

01:06:42.770 --> 01:06:45.965
Not any more than you wanted me. I have
an office, not that I do much in it.

01:06:46.065 --> 01:06:48.236
Say, perhaps Mac
could come and help me.

01:06:48.336 --> 01:06:49.964
Oh, that would be wonderful.

01:06:50.064 --> 01:06:53.197
You two could plan the airport
together. What airport is that?

01:06:53.297 --> 01:06:55.242
The most remarkable invention
you've ever heard of,

01:06:55.342 --> 01:06:57.582
a suspended airport right
in the middle of the city,

01:06:57.682 --> 01:06:58.926
stretched like
a tennis racket.

01:06:59.026 --> 01:07:01.613
But would it be strong enough? I
mean, after all, a tennis racket.

01:07:01.713 --> 01:07:03.568
What's Gerry's husband like?
Who?

01:07:03.668 --> 01:07:05.611
Oh, just a flop.
A big flop?

01:07:05.711 --> 01:07:07.673
Yes, any way you'd take it.

01:07:07.811 --> 01:07:10.829
Well, he won't be such a flop
with his $99,000.

01:07:10.929 --> 01:07:13.696
Snoodles will give it to him,
all right. And why not?

01:07:13.858 --> 01:07:16.706
I ought to marry him and
get it back into the family.

01:07:16.866 --> 01:07:21.040
That would be a big joke. Of
course, I'm crazy, I'll marry anyone.

01:07:21.140 --> 01:07:23.020
What's this about $99,000?

01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:24.173
I might be able to help him.

01:07:24.273 --> 01:07:26.479
In fact, I will be able to help
him. In fact, I'll help him. Why not?

01:07:26.579 --> 01:07:29.037
Will you really? Of course I
will, up to a certain point.

01:07:29.137 --> 01:07:30.480
How much
would a working model cost?

01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:33.517
$99... I mean, $100,000,
in that neighborhood.

01:07:33.617 --> 01:07:35.694
That shouldn't be a very
difficult neighborhood to find.

01:07:35.794 --> 01:07:37.196
I think I'll be able
to do it, all right.

01:07:37.296 --> 01:07:39.310
Oh, really?
You've made me so happy.

01:07:39.410 --> 01:07:41.201
You don't know
how much trouble he's had.

01:07:41.301 --> 01:07:42.293
Is that so?

01:07:42.393 --> 01:07:44.723
He won't know what trouble really
is till he tangles up with Maude.

01:07:44.823 --> 01:07:46.675
Oh, that's rather unkind.
I shouldn't have said it.

01:07:46.775 --> 01:07:49.165
You say about $100,000?
Exactly $100,000.

01:07:49.265 --> 01:07:50.497
It's built.

01:07:52.261 --> 01:07:55.791
You mean her husband wants $99,000
before he'll give her a divorce?

01:07:55.891 --> 01:07:59.343
Oh, I love you like this, with
lightning flashing out of your eyes.

01:07:59.443 --> 01:08:00.819
Did she tell you that story?

01:08:00.919 --> 01:08:03.024
Why should we talk about
that heel when you're here?

01:08:03.124 --> 01:08:04.207
Did she tell you that?

01:08:04.307 --> 01:08:06.735
Do that again. I love it.
Listen...

01:08:06.835 --> 01:08:09.107
Oh, Snoodles,
that's wonderful!

01:08:09.207 --> 01:08:11.059
Tom... Mac will be wild
with excitement.

01:08:11.159 --> 01:08:13.875
You know, when you've waited
so long. Not at all, not at all.

01:08:13.975 --> 01:08:15.407
I'm delighted
to have the opportunity.

01:08:15.507 --> 01:08:18.064
Look... Darling, I have
the most wonderful news.

01:08:18.165 --> 01:08:20.176
Snoodles is going to build
your airport for you.

01:08:20.276 --> 01:08:21.679
Why should he build it?
I'll build it.

01:08:21.779 --> 01:08:23.392
You don't even know
what it is, Maude.

01:08:24.615 --> 01:08:25.712
Quiet, Toto.

01:08:25.813 --> 01:08:27.727
Well, that gives us a lot to
look forward to, doesn't it?

01:08:27.827 --> 01:08:28.977
I don't know
if I've told you, Mac,

01:08:29.077 --> 01:08:31.763
but your sister and I have progressed
considerably since this afternoon.

01:08:31.863 --> 01:08:33.010
Oh, is that so?

01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:34.835
What's all this business
about your husband

01:08:34.935 --> 01:08:37.652
wanting $99,000
before he sets you free?

01:08:37.752 --> 01:08:39.573
Oh, that was just an idea
that he had.

01:08:39.673 --> 01:08:41.493
You know how people are
when they're upset.

01:08:41.593 --> 01:08:43.471
I'm not sure
that he actually meant it.

01:08:43.572 --> 01:08:46.194
Let's not even talk about it.
No, no, let's face it.

01:08:46.295 --> 01:08:48.532
Gerry naturally wants to
defend this human bacterium.

01:08:48.631 --> 01:08:50.356
Of course, that's only natural
and gallant.

01:08:50.456 --> 01:08:52.245
But the fact of the matter is,
he's asked her for it,

01:08:52.345 --> 01:08:53.970
and as soon as my name
comes into it, we're doomed.

01:08:54.071 --> 01:08:55.412
Broiled.
As a Hackensacker,

01:08:55.513 --> 01:08:57.426
I find it cheaper to pay
than to fight.

01:08:57.526 --> 01:09:00.790
Of course, $99,000 isn't a small sum,
but on the other hand, it isn't large.

01:09:00.890 --> 01:09:02.964
I should say not.
Why, when I think of Stefan,

01:09:03.064 --> 01:09:05.426
to say nothing of Serge,
or that big one with the scar,

01:09:05.526 --> 01:09:07.488
what was his name?
Itsk.

01:09:07.721 --> 01:09:09.332
Baron Itsk, Lucius.

01:09:09.432 --> 01:09:11.075
Itsk?
Nitzk, Toto.

01:09:11.273 --> 01:09:13.429
I'm awfully sorry
to hear that about Tom.

01:09:13.529 --> 01:09:17.653
I knew he was a failure and a dreamer, I
guess, but I didn't know he was a skunk.

01:09:17.752 --> 01:09:20.595
It's very kind of you to want to build
the airport. I mean, the model of it.

01:09:20.694 --> 01:09:22.453
I guess I was a little
too stunned to say thank you,

01:09:22.554 --> 01:09:25.816
but you know how it is when you've been
waiting for something for a long time.

01:09:25.916 --> 01:09:27.638
There's only one trouble
with the whole setup,

01:09:27.738 --> 01:09:30.006
something that Gerry neglected
to tell you.

01:09:30.107 --> 01:09:32.051
That is that I'm not alone
in this invention.

01:09:32.151 --> 01:09:34.676
That human bacterium we were
talking about, her husband,

01:09:34.776 --> 01:09:36.787
has had exactly as much
to do with it as I have.

01:09:36.888 --> 01:09:39.251
So, you see, if you help me,
you'd be helping him, too.

01:09:39.350 --> 01:09:41.746
I know that nothing could
be further from your wish.

01:09:41.845 --> 01:09:43.939
How about dancing
with your brother?

01:09:46.571 --> 01:09:48.872
Shut up, Toto.
My brother is thinking.

01:09:49.067 --> 01:09:51.443
What did you have
to do that for, you fat-head?

01:09:51.542 --> 01:09:53.816
Don't you ever get tired
of being noble?

01:09:53.916 --> 01:09:56.341
Everything I build up for you,
you knock down.

01:09:56.441 --> 01:09:58.615
I've got you the money twice
already. Look, darling...

01:09:58.715 --> 01:10:01.433
No, no, I don't want to listen to
anything that begins with, "Look, darling,"

01:10:01.533 --> 01:10:03.925
so that you can get off
another noble saying.

01:10:04.025 --> 01:10:05.817
Can't you ever learn
to be practical?

01:10:05.917 --> 01:10:08.601
Don't you know that the greatest
men in the world have told lies

01:10:08.701 --> 01:10:11.514
and let things be misunderstood
if it was useful to them?

01:10:11.614 --> 01:10:13.720
Didn't you ever hear
of a campaign promise?

01:10:13.820 --> 01:10:16.057
The way you are is the
way you have to be, honey.

01:10:16.157 --> 01:10:18.426
That's the way I am. If
I'm supposed to be a flop...

01:10:18.526 --> 01:10:20.282
You're not going to be a flop.

01:10:20.382 --> 01:10:23.578
Nobody who's been married to me for
five years is going to be a flop.

01:10:23.678 --> 01:10:27.306
You're going to get your airport if
I have to build it for you myself.

01:10:27.469 --> 01:10:30.535
After I'm married.
After you're married.

01:10:31.533 --> 01:10:33.956
That's a funny thing
to hear your wife say.

01:10:36.430 --> 01:10:38.105
I've got it. I'll build it.

01:10:38.205 --> 01:10:40.955
His share will be more than $99,000,
so he'll have to release you.

01:10:41.055 --> 01:10:42.681
Whose share? That
scoundrel she's married to.

01:10:42.781 --> 01:10:44.759
Isn't that brilliant? It's the
first bright thought he's ever had.

01:10:44.859 --> 01:10:46.650
That's marvelous.
It was really very simple.

01:10:46.750 --> 01:10:47.929
Now, shall we change partners?

01:10:48.029 --> 01:10:49.560
It seems a shame to waste
such a beautiful sister

01:10:49.660 --> 01:10:52.744
upon a brother that doesn't
appreciate her. You said it.

01:11:08.591 --> 01:11:11.292
Thank you so much.
It was delightful.

01:11:11.392 --> 01:11:12.783
Not at all.

01:11:14.864 --> 01:11:16.572
Oh, dear.
What's the matter?

01:11:16.672 --> 01:11:19.129
We must have forgotten
Toto someplace. Is that so?

01:11:19.229 --> 01:11:21.788
I suppose he'll show up,
though. He always does.

01:11:21.888 --> 01:11:23.696
Greetings.
Ah, yes.

01:11:24.945 --> 01:11:28.174
Wouldn't he be awful to be
married to? Always hanging around.

01:11:36.401 --> 01:11:39.322
Captain, you have renewed
my faith in mankind.

01:11:39.422 --> 01:11:41.930
Well, there's nothing
like saving your faith.

01:11:42.257 --> 01:11:45.724
You are too, too divine.
You're a very embarrassing lady.

01:11:45.824 --> 01:11:47.582
If I weren't a little bit
mixed up at the moment,

01:11:47.682 --> 01:11:50.523
I'd take you up on a few of your
dares and make you say "papa."

01:11:50.623 --> 01:11:51.755
"Papa?"

01:11:52.626 --> 01:11:54.334
How would you like to go
to Fort Myers tomorrow?

01:11:54.434 --> 01:11:56.573
There's nothing there,
but the ride might be nice.

01:11:56.673 --> 01:11:58.301
We might put Toto in the Army.

01:11:58.401 --> 01:11:59.394
I may not be here tomorrow.

01:11:59.494 --> 01:12:00.890
What do you mean,
you may not be here tomorrow?

01:12:00.990 --> 01:12:03.420
I'm a little bit mixed up, but I sort
of have an appointment in New York.

01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:06.109
Oh, let her wait, whoever she
is. She's no good for you anyway.

01:12:06.209 --> 01:12:07.454
While I on the other hand...

01:12:07.554 --> 01:12:09.597
You never think of anything,
but topic "A," do you?

01:12:09.697 --> 01:12:11.243
Is there anything else?

01:12:11.379 --> 01:12:14.641
I'll leave you with that thought,
Captain. Bonsoir, drip-drap.

01:12:48.981 --> 01:12:50.542
Oh, dear.

01:12:50.773 --> 01:12:52.162
You're very kind.

01:12:52.262 --> 01:12:54.206
I think this is
the happiest night of my life.

01:12:54.306 --> 01:12:56.254
Oh, really, Snoodles?
Yes.

01:12:56.354 --> 01:12:59.199
You've freed me of a certain timidity,
from which I've always suffered.

01:12:59.299 --> 01:13:01.889
And now, with you and Mac
and the airport,

01:13:01.989 --> 01:13:04.577
I can see great days ahead,
full of fun and everything.

01:13:04.677 --> 01:13:06.051
Oh, I'm sure of it, Snoodles.

01:13:06.151 --> 01:13:08.095
By the way, I have a little
surprise for you in a few minutes,

01:13:08.195 --> 01:13:09.216
so don't be surprised.

01:13:09.316 --> 01:13:10.627
What is it?
If I told you what it is

01:13:10.727 --> 01:13:12.515
then it wouldn't be
a surprise anymore.

01:13:12.615 --> 01:13:16.032
Well, I wouldn't do anything too
surprising if I were you, Snoodles.

01:13:16.132 --> 01:13:18.370
You never can tell how those
things are going to turn out.

01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:21.758
I'm persuaded you'll be delighted.
Well, I certainly hope I will be.

01:13:21.858 --> 01:13:23.425
If you'll just leave your
window open onto the balcony.

01:13:23.525 --> 01:13:24.495
What?

01:13:24.595 --> 01:13:25.535
What was that?

01:13:25.635 --> 01:13:27.519
Oh, I didn't hear anything.
Good night, Snoodles.

01:13:27.619 --> 01:13:29.023
I'll see you in a little
while, then. Good night.

01:13:29.123 --> 01:13:32.308
I'll see you in my dreams.
Yes, that's a very good place.

01:13:40.856 --> 01:13:42.369
You're a fast worker,
aren't you?

01:13:42.469 --> 01:13:43.781
You have your nerve to talk.

01:13:43.881 --> 01:13:46.721
So you couldn't even wait a decent
interval, you and your princess.

01:13:46.821 --> 01:13:49.711
I hope you're very proud
of yourself, Captain McGlue.

01:13:51.161 --> 01:13:54.244
Wait a minute! No, let
me go, you big pullover.

01:13:54.344 --> 01:13:56.979
No, no, I just broke that
because it was handy.

01:13:57.081 --> 01:13:59.846
Oh, well, then you ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

01:13:59.946 --> 01:14:01.377
I'm the one
who has the right to...

01:14:01.477 --> 01:14:02.914
I know I'm an idiot,
but I suppose it's...

01:14:03.014 --> 01:14:05.092
When you've been fond of
somebody for a long time you...

01:14:05.192 --> 01:14:06.690
You shouldn't
have come down here.

01:14:06.790 --> 01:14:08.069
You had no right
to come down here.

01:14:08.169 --> 01:14:10.821
You should have given me a little
time to get used to the idea.

01:14:10.921 --> 01:14:12.322
Maybe I should,

01:14:12.422 --> 01:14:14.468
but you can't blame a man for
trying to hold on to something

01:14:14.568 --> 01:14:18.034
that he loves, that he always
has loved, and always will love.

01:14:18.298 --> 01:14:20.356
You're going to make me cry.
Gerry...

01:14:20.456 --> 01:14:24.005
No, you're forgetting the airport.
You're forgetting everything that counts.

01:14:24.105 --> 01:14:26.391
Gerry...
No! It's all finished.

01:14:26.842 --> 01:14:29.251
When you make a decision,
you have to stand by it,

01:14:29.351 --> 01:14:32.838
and you can't let champagne,
or tree toads,

01:14:32.938 --> 01:14:35.624
or night flowers, or
memories get in the way of it.

01:14:35.724 --> 01:14:38.024
It's all over,
and I know it's for the best.

01:14:38.124 --> 01:14:39.302
But, Gerry, I...

01:14:39.402 --> 01:14:41.764
Oh, no, now, listen to me
just this once, will you?

01:14:41.864 --> 01:14:45.254
I've always done what you wanted,
and it's always turned out a disaster.

01:14:45.354 --> 01:14:47.828
Good night, darling.
Sleep tight.

01:14:49.532 --> 01:14:51.881
It'll be funny sleeping with
a sitting room between us.

01:14:51.981 --> 01:14:55.128
And the doors locked. You
don't have to worry about that.

01:14:56.092 --> 01:14:58.231
Nevertheless.
Good night, dear.

01:14:59.549 --> 01:15:00.543
What?

01:15:00.643 --> 01:15:02.150
Well, don't you kiss
your brother good night?

01:15:02.250 --> 01:15:04.106
I don't know,
I never had a brother.

01:15:04.206 --> 01:15:05.465
You have one now.

01:15:06.845 --> 01:15:08.371
You fool.

01:15:13.629 --> 01:15:14.971
What's that?

01:15:25.918 --> 01:15:28.504
Good night,
sweetheart

01:15:28.670 --> 01:15:32.379
Till we meet tomorrow

01:15:32.861 --> 01:15:35.796
Good night, sweetheart

01:15:36.158 --> 01:15:39.900
Sleep away your sorrow

01:15:40.637 --> 01:15:43.467
He shouldn't do things like that
on a night like this. Good night.

01:15:43.567 --> 01:15:46.900
May make us forlorn

01:15:47.358 --> 01:15:50.392
But with the dawn

01:15:50.687 --> 01:15:53.258
A new day is born

01:15:53.358 --> 01:15:58.133
So I'll say good night,
sweetheart

01:15:58.688 --> 01:16:02.332
Though I'm not beside you

01:16:02.912 --> 01:16:05.694
Good night, sweetheart

01:16:06.176 --> 01:16:09.788
Still my love will guide you

01:16:10.241 --> 01:16:13.023
Dreams enfold you

01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:17.215
In each one I'll hold you

01:16:17.697 --> 01:16:20.599
Good night, sweetheart

01:16:20.705 --> 01:16:22.623
Good night

01:16:24.993 --> 01:16:28.027
Good night, sweetheart

01:16:28.513 --> 01:16:31.993
Till we meet tomorrow

01:16:32.673 --> 01:16:35.674
Good night, sweetheart

01:16:35.906 --> 01:16:39.419
Sleep away your sorrow

01:16:40.194 --> 01:16:45.944
Tears and partings
may make us forlorn

01:16:47.074 --> 01:16:49.921
But with the dawn

01:16:50.178 --> 01:16:53.099
A new day is born

01:16:53.199 --> 01:16:57.824
So I'll say good night,
sweetheart

01:16:58.371 --> 01:17:02.364
Though I'm not beside you

01:17:02.467 --> 01:17:04.988
Good night, sweetheart

01:17:05.604 --> 01:17:09.532
Still my love will guide you

01:17:10.179 --> 01:17:12.896
Dreams enfold you

01:17:13.092 --> 01:17:16.954
In each one I'll hold you

01:17:17.220 --> 01:17:20.067
Good night, sweetheart

01:17:20.196 --> 01:17:22.115
Good night

01:17:24.389 --> 01:17:28.000
Good night, sweetheart

01:17:28.101 --> 01:17:32.029
Till we meet tomorrow

01:17:32.293 --> 01:17:35.108
Good night, sweetheart

01:17:35.461 --> 01:17:39.072
Sleep will banish sorrow

01:17:39.748 --> 01:17:42.578
Tears and parting

01:17:42.678 --> 01:17:45.826
May make us forlorn

01:17:46.565 --> 01:17:48.462
But with the dawn

01:17:48.562 --> 01:17:51.267
I can't open
this blasted dress.

01:17:51.813 --> 01:17:54.661
All right.
Come over here to the light.

01:17:54.822 --> 01:17:57.310
Good night, sweetheart

01:17:57.958 --> 01:18:01.602
Though I'm not beside you

01:18:02.118 --> 01:18:06.511
Good night, sweetheart
Still my love will guide you

01:18:06.611 --> 01:18:07.749
Sorry.

01:18:09.735 --> 01:18:11.248
Dreams enfold you

01:18:11.348 --> 01:18:13.776
Can you get it?
Just a minute.

01:18:13.876 --> 01:18:16.148
In each one I'll hold you

01:18:16.248 --> 01:18:18.355
Oh, darling, darling, darling!

01:18:18.455 --> 01:18:20.447
Good night, sweetheart

01:18:20.584 --> 01:18:22.502
Good night

01:18:25.256 --> 01:18:28.158
I hope you realize
this is costing us millions.

01:18:30.504 --> 01:18:32.422
Good night

01:18:44.489 --> 01:18:46.612
I suppose there's a law
against shooting those things?

01:18:46.712 --> 01:18:48.704
Yes, ma'am, I think there is.

01:18:50.825 --> 01:18:53.607
Oh, good morning, Toto.
Greetings.

01:18:55.848 --> 01:18:57.973
It doesn't seem to matter how
much champagne you soak up,

01:18:58.073 --> 01:18:59.538
you always feel great
the next morning.

01:18:59.638 --> 01:19:01.619
Hello.
Thank you, darling.

01:19:01.719 --> 01:19:04.869
I suppose it takes an iron
constitution to be a house guest.

01:19:13.610 --> 01:19:16.083
Why don't you go away
someplace?

01:19:16.183 --> 01:19:17.909
There must be somebody else
who can use a house guest.

01:19:18.009 --> 01:19:19.572
I can't be
the only sucker in the world.

01:19:19.672 --> 01:19:21.652
Why don't you go to Havana?
That's a nice place,

01:19:21.752 --> 01:19:23.317
and I'd treat you
to a nice one-way ticket.

01:19:23.417 --> 01:19:25.877
Havana? You, me, Havana?

01:19:25.977 --> 01:19:29.379
No, Toto.
You, Havana. Me, here.

01:19:29.484 --> 01:19:31.655
Nitz.
I was afraid of that.

01:19:32.267 --> 01:19:34.584
Say, Maude, is this all right? You
have to work fast in these matters,

01:19:34.684 --> 01:19:36.375
so I just slid down to Margetsons
and slid back with this.

01:19:36.475 --> 01:19:38.868
Hello.
What is it? The Hope Blue?

01:19:38.968 --> 01:19:40.183
No, no, it's just
a chip from it.

01:19:40.283 --> 01:19:42.644
Boy, when you fall,
you fall, don't you?

01:19:42.744 --> 01:19:44.503
Go away, Toto.
This might give you ideas.

01:19:44.603 --> 01:19:45.597
It's all right, then?

01:19:45.697 --> 01:19:47.125
I think she'll know what you mean. Good.

01:19:47.225 --> 01:19:50.069
How do you think this would
look on the Captain's vest?

01:19:50.169 --> 01:19:52.196
Maude,
you're really incorrigible.

01:19:52.748 --> 01:19:55.432
No, no, Toto.
Naughty, naughty. Here.

01:20:28.909 --> 01:20:31.706
I suppose I'll have to give
the bracelet back, won't I?

01:20:31.806 --> 01:20:32.807
Why?

01:20:34.607 --> 01:20:36.037
Oh, dear.

01:20:36.399 --> 01:20:38.341
What are you talking about?

01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:40.633
Snoodles, I'm so fond of you.

01:20:40.733 --> 01:20:42.589
You're a lovely, generous,
good-hearted man.

01:20:42.689 --> 01:20:45.404
Really a woman's ideal. Only, you
shouldn't have sung last night.

01:20:45.504 --> 01:20:46.936
What?
Here's your bracelet.

01:20:47.036 --> 01:20:48.413
I'm going back to my husband.

01:20:48.513 --> 01:20:50.041
That skunk?
Oh, he isn't really.

01:20:50.141 --> 01:20:52.121
I let you think much worse
about him than he is.

01:20:52.221 --> 01:20:53.688
You know how a woman
likes sympathy.

01:20:53.788 --> 01:20:55.256
But what about the $99,000?

01:20:55.356 --> 01:20:57.467
He didn't want that,
I wanted it for him.

01:20:57.567 --> 01:20:58.704
But...

01:21:00.785 --> 01:21:02.201
Put it away.
What?

01:21:02.301 --> 01:21:04.111
Put it away.
But, darling...

01:21:04.273 --> 01:21:06.908
I'll just take one more look at
it and then put it away forever.

01:21:07.008 --> 01:21:09.808
There's a limit
to what a woman can stand.

01:21:11.281 --> 01:21:13.404
Hello there, Snoodles.
How's every little thing?

01:21:13.504 --> 01:21:15.741
I'm very unhappy, as a matter
of fact. You'll get over it.

01:21:15.841 --> 01:21:17.403
You know about Gerry's decision? Yes.

01:21:17.503 --> 01:21:20.572
I'll never get over it as long as I
live. I had such hopes, such plans.

01:21:20.672 --> 01:21:22.651
Oh, Snoodles, I'm so sorry.

01:21:22.751 --> 01:21:25.022
Anyway, we still have the
airport, that'll keep us busy.

01:21:25.122 --> 01:21:27.935
What's knittin', kittens?
Gerry's going back to her husband.

01:21:28.035 --> 01:21:30.367
Oh, you poor dumb thing.
I know just how it is.

01:21:30.467 --> 01:21:31.645
I'll bet he's a knockout.

01:21:31.745 --> 01:21:33.054
I'm awfully sorry
about Snoodles.

01:21:33.154 --> 01:21:35.007
Well, anyway, darling, you'll
still have your airport,

01:21:35.107 --> 01:21:37.790
and you and the Captain and I will be
as busy as bird dogs, won't we, Captain?

01:21:37.890 --> 01:21:39.549
I'm afraid that isn't
possible, either. Why not?

01:21:39.649 --> 01:21:42.366
I still have, I always will have
the deepest affection for you.

01:21:42.466 --> 01:21:44.799
Certainly nothing has happened to
spoil my friendship with your brother.

01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:46.300
Being with him
will remind me of you.

01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:48.460
Well, you see...
What now?

01:21:48.819 --> 01:21:50.975
He isn't exactly my brother.

01:21:51.075 --> 01:21:53.548
He isn't exactly your brother?
No.

01:21:53.747 --> 01:21:56.464
Hello.
Oh, shut up.

01:21:56.595 --> 01:21:58.945
He's my husband.

01:21:59.045 --> 01:22:00.606
He's your husband?
That's right.

01:22:00.706 --> 01:22:03.677
Well, no wonder. I thought
I was losing my grip.

01:22:03.777 --> 01:22:05.503
You mean the vermin who...
Who... Who... Who what?

01:22:05.603 --> 01:22:07.678
That's right, you said he
didn't. Then who is McGlue?

01:22:07.778 --> 01:22:09.888
There is no McGlue. Well,
thank heavens for something.

01:22:09.988 --> 01:22:10.980
That name.

01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:12.639
Then it's the Jeffers Airport.
That's it, isn't it?

01:22:12.739 --> 01:22:14.141
Are you still talking
about that airport?

01:22:14.241 --> 01:22:16.157
You really take it on the
chin, don't you? Why not?

01:22:16.257 --> 01:22:17.984
If an idea has merit,
it has merit.

01:22:18.084 --> 01:22:19.965
Sentiment and business
don't belong in the same bed.

01:22:20.065 --> 01:22:23.038
After all, Grandfather loathed oil.
You know it made his eyes water.

01:22:23.138 --> 01:22:24.800
But that didn't stop him from
making millions out of it.

01:22:24.900 --> 01:22:26.845
You mean you still want to
go through with the airport?

01:22:26.945 --> 01:22:29.056
Why not? On a purely
business basis, of course.

01:22:29.156 --> 01:22:31.808
Right now I don't like you,
although I may get over it later.

01:22:31.908 --> 01:22:33.919
Right now I need something
to occupy my mind.

01:22:34.019 --> 01:22:37.056
The airport is something, if
not exactly what I hoped for.

01:22:37.156 --> 01:22:39.134
I'll be very lonely
without you, Gerry.

01:22:39.234 --> 01:22:41.150
Oh, Captain, and thou.

01:22:41.250 --> 01:22:43.393
I don't suppose
you have a sister?

01:22:43.493 --> 01:22:44.926
Only a twin sister.

01:22:45.026 --> 01:22:47.422
A twin sister? Oh, didn't
you know about that?

01:22:47.522 --> 01:22:50.080
That's how we were married in
the beginning, both being twins.

01:22:50.180 --> 01:22:51.555
Of course that's another plot
entirely.

01:22:51.655 --> 01:22:53.086
Both twins?
Both twins?

01:22:53.186 --> 01:22:54.271
Are you a twin?
Are you a twin?

01:22:54.371 --> 01:22:55.345
Yes.

01:22:55.445 --> 01:22:56.738
Well, what's he doing?
Well, what's she doing?

01:22:56.840 --> 01:22:58.384
Well, nothing.
Well, nothing, you see...

01:22:59.305 --> 01:23:05.704
