00:02.848 --> 00:05.717
<i>Incoming groundbridge request...</i>

00:05.719 --> 00:07.919
from Scotland.

00:12.325 --> 00:15.794
Wheeljack, what happened?
Where are the others?

00:15.796 --> 00:18.563
Having a swell time
taking the long way home

00:18.565 --> 00:22.701
in Ultra Magnus' boat, I'm sure.
Miko included.

00:22.703 --> 00:25.637
I wondered what was taking
so long with those sodas.

00:25.639 --> 00:27.873
Did you secure the Predacon bone?

00:27.875 --> 00:31.343
The beast hunt kind of imploded, Doc.

00:31.345 --> 00:34.313
<i>Well, I just got wind
of another 'Con hotspot.</i>

00:34.315 --> 00:36.648
<i>Right outside of Taos, New Mexico.</i>

00:36.650 --> 00:39.685
Since Prime's unit isn't
back from oil country...

00:39.687 --> 00:41.920
Raf, set a bridge for
Fowler's coordinates.

00:41.922 --> 00:44.690
- You, roll with me.
- Not today, all right?

00:44.692 --> 00:47.392
If you're all right
sending me out there alone.

00:47.394 --> 00:49.661
Alone's how I prefer to roll.

00:49.663 --> 00:53.332
Wheeljack, you do not
want to make me abandon

00:53.334 --> 00:56.968
a complex equation to venture
outside my comfort zone.

00:57.770 --> 01:03.442
Fine... but in case you
haven't figured it out...

01:04.410 --> 01:09.047
I don't play well with others.

01:13.520 --> 01:15.120
Scrap.

Know what I love most
about Vehicon troopers?

02:07.800 --> 02:09.870
They're easily distracted.

02:53.180 --> 02:55.510
You sure you weren't a Wrecker?

02:55.520 --> 02:57.820
You sure you don't
play well with others?

03:14.130 --> 03:18.140
- Nice shooting, Tex.
- Hey, Mom, what's up?

03:18.140 --> 03:21.140
Nurse Darby, what brings you here?

03:21.140 --> 03:24.540
The medical supplies you so
graciously offered to donate

03:24.550 --> 03:27.250
that Jack keeps
forgetting to bring home.

03:27.250 --> 03:30.850
The hospital appreciates
your generosity, Agent Fowler.

03:30.850 --> 03:33.720
Please, call me William.

03:35.620 --> 03:39.590
Guys, I found a Predacon talon...
in a museum.

03:39.590 --> 03:43.700
Scientists were totally stumped
when they excavated it in 1922,

03:43.700 --> 03:46.570
So it's been in storage.

03:46.570 --> 03:47.970
But we're fresh out of Beast Hunters.

03:48.970 --> 03:53.240
I didn't choose "emergency"
as my vehicle mode for laughs.

03:53.240 --> 03:56.680
Not sure you need a 'Bot.

03:56.680 --> 04:00.780
Maybe you should all
just wait for Optimus.

04:00.780 --> 04:05.300
I'll have you know, nurse Darby.
I was an army Ranger and federal Agent

04:05.300 --> 04:09.820
for Unit-E three decades before I'd
ever heard the name Optimus Prime.

04:09.820 --> 04:12.830
I'm more than equipped
to handle a milk run.

04:12.830 --> 04:19.130
- In fact, why don't you tag along?
- Oh, I don't know about that.

04:19.130 --> 04:21.269
<i>Absolutely not.</i>

04:21.269 --> 04:23.870
Mom, I don't want you
anywhere near anything 'Con.

04:23.870 --> 04:25.640
- It's not...
- Safe?

04:25.640 --> 04:27.970
Is my teenage son
seriously going to tell me

04:27.980 --> 04:30.780
that its fine for him to
travel all the way to Cybertron,

04:30.780 --> 04:34.010
but his mother can't be
trusted to go on a... on a...

04:34.020 --> 04:36.720
- Milk run.
- A milk run?

04:36.720 --> 04:38.250
No, I... it's just...

04:38.250 --> 04:41.890
you're lactose intolerant, and I...

04:43.260 --> 04:45.720
Come on, Agent Fowler.

04:52.900 --> 04:55.600
<i>Ah, you performed well, my pet.</i>

04:55.600 --> 04:58.170
This will be a splendid contribution

04:58.170 --> 05:02.040
to the spawning
of your Predacon brethren.

05:02.040 --> 05:03.980
My liege, we've located another

05:03.980 --> 05:06.680
of Shockwave's Predacon
energy signatures.

05:06.680 --> 05:09.880
- Weak, but steady.
- Excellent.

05:09.880 --> 05:13.350
Knockout, do not return empty-handed.

05:13.350 --> 05:16.060
<i>Moi?
Don't know the meaning of the word.</i>

05:16.060 --> 05:19.330
Isn't "empty-handed" two words?

05:19.330 --> 05:22.900
You would know, or did
your missing armor turn up?

05:22.900 --> 05:26.300
- Why, you wheel-bound...
- Starscream!

05:26.300 --> 05:29.600
You have failed me enough for one day.

05:29.600 --> 05:34.870
Assume the task of monitoring for
Predacon energy signatures, at once!

05:34.880 --> 05:36.240
Yes, my liege.

05:36.240 --> 05:40.980
I'm sure you'll find the gig
as invigorating as I did, "Screamer".

05:41.480 --> 05:45.050
<i>Shockwave has
initiated the cloning process</i>

05:45.050 --> 05:48.020
<i>with the specimens gathered thus far.</i>

05:48.020 --> 05:51.320
<i>The Predacon currently among
us will be but the first</i>

05:51.330 --> 05:55.710
<i>of a new wave of beast
machine super-soldiers.</i>

05:56.830 --> 05:59.130
<i>What are you lurking about for?</i>

05:59.130 --> 06:01.100
<i>Get back to your kennel.</i>

06:07.110 --> 06:10.680
You mindless brute,
look what you've done!

06:19.050 --> 06:23.460
- You're awfully quiet, Wheeljack.
- I've never been one for chitchat.

06:23.460 --> 06:27.230
Why do you pretend?
If you really wanted to roll alone,

06:27.230 --> 06:29.160
you would've hit the open road today.

06:29.160 --> 06:32.260
But you didn't. You called
for a 'bridge back to base.

06:32.270 --> 06:36.570
- Hey. Don't assume you know me.
- I'm not assuming.

06:37.840 --> 06:41.610
Now, care to chitchat about
what happened out there?

06:45.180 --> 06:47.710
<i>What did I tell you?
Milk run.</i>

06:47.710 --> 06:51.380
- With one cranky cow.
- The curator?

06:51.390 --> 06:53.320
Acted like he was
guarding the Mona Lisa,

06:53.320 --> 06:55.150
instead of some prehistoric lug nut

06:55.160 --> 06:57.720
that's been gathering dust
since Harding was president.

06:57.720 --> 07:00.730
I have to say, Agent
Fowler, you handled him well.

07:00.730 --> 07:02.660
I was quite impressed.

07:02.660 --> 07:06.770
Nurse Darby, I'd say that puts
you one step ahead of my ex.

07:06.770 --> 07:09.430
Hmm. Divorced, huh?

07:09.440 --> 07:14.640
Yeah. What about you?
What's the story with Mr. Darby?

07:14.640 --> 07:19.280
More like a saga, but one
I'm sure you've heard before.

07:21.350 --> 07:24.620
<i>I have a bone to pick with both of you.</i>

07:26.450 --> 07:27.820
Run!

07:33.760 --> 07:38.300
<i>Kick back, relax, and enjoy the scenery.</i>

07:56.180 --> 07:58.450
<i>Knockout to Lord Megatron.</i>

07:58.450 --> 08:01.890
<i>I have secured one
vintage Predacon talon,</i>

08:01.890 --> 08:04.020
<i>plus two of the Autobots' pets</i>

08:04.020 --> 08:09.000
<i>for you to employ as hostages, lab
experiments, well anyway you see fit,</i>

08:09.030 --> 08:14.530
<i>so go on, Big M, tell me you
love me more than Starscream.</i>

08:14.530 --> 08:17.300
<i>My liege?
Hello?</i>

08:17.300 --> 08:19.370
<i>Too familiar?</i>

08:19.670 --> 08:24.840
<i>The primitive mutt demolishes
our entire communications network</i>

08:24.840 --> 08:29.480
and lord Megatron intends
to breed more of it?

08:29.480 --> 08:34.190
Would you two hurry?
I want this fixed before our Master

08:34.190 --> 08:38.260
is bothered by such distracting minutiae.

08:43.360 --> 08:47.800
<i>Entering access override
code and rebooting now.</i>

08:52.770 --> 08:55.630
No!
No, no, no, no!

09:04.220 --> 09:06.520
It's really taking them a while.

09:06.520 --> 09:11.590
- Arcee and Wheeljack?
- My Mom and Agent Fowler.

09:11.590 --> 09:13.420
Maybe they stopped for dinner.

09:13.430 --> 09:15.530
Isn't that what grown-ups
do when they're dating?

09:17.230 --> 09:19.300
It's what grown-ups
do when they're hungry.

09:21.370 --> 09:24.440
<i>- Mom.
- Guess again, Jack rabbit.</i>

09:24.440 --> 09:26.600
<i>and I hope you're not still thirsty</i>

09:26.610 --> 09:29.610
because I'm bringing back
something way cooler that sodas.

09:31.610 --> 09:34.410
I can't talk, Miko.
I need to leave this line free.

09:34.410 --> 09:38.450
Wait, don't hang up.
Did Wheeljack show?

09:38.450 --> 09:41.420
<i>I think Bulkhead's
really worried about him.</i>

09:41.420 --> 09:44.490
Wheeljack is fine.
He's on a mission with Arcee.

09:44.490 --> 09:48.960
Wheeljack's riding with a new
partner already? That's cold.

09:48.960 --> 09:52.530
What? No. It's just one
mission, they're not partners.

09:52.530 --> 09:54.970
I wondered how long it would take

09:54.970 --> 09:57.430
our two lone wolves to hook up.

10:06.610 --> 10:09.350
I told you we should
have waited for Optimus.

10:09.350 --> 10:11.820
There it is.
The "I told you so."

10:11.820 --> 10:15.050
Well, no sale, sister.
The 'Con was at the museum.

10:15.050 --> 10:18.760
If we had waited, he would have snagged
the talon before Prime got there.

10:18.760 --> 10:23.330
And given our current situation,
what difference would that have made?

10:23.330 --> 10:25.830
<i>Hello? How long
have you two been dating?</i>

10:25.830 --> 10:28.770
<i>Because you bicker like
an old married couple.</i>

10:28.770 --> 10:30.570
- What?
- We're not dating.

10:30.570 --> 10:33.000
<i>Frankly, I find it repulsive,</i>

10:33.010 --> 10:37.910
<i>the whole idea of you
fleshies interfacing.</i>

10:39.380 --> 10:42.850
<i>Knockout to base,
requesting pick up, again...</i>

10:44.720 --> 10:48.050
<i>All right, is anyone
up there receiving me?!</i>

10:48.050 --> 10:50.920
Nurse Darby. June.

10:50.920 --> 10:53.860
If this 'Con gets us
to Megatron's warship,

10:53.860 --> 10:59.030
the chances of the 'bots ever
finding us decrease a thousand fold.

10:59.030 --> 11:03.400
Never let a Decepticon take
you to a second location.

11:03.400 --> 11:05.470
He disarmed me back at the museum.

11:05.470 --> 11:07.870
Do you have anything we
could use as a weapon?

11:11.940 --> 11:15.880
- Pepper spray?
- On a 'Bot?

11:20.020 --> 11:25.020
Guys like 'Magnus...
I don't let them peel my paint.

11:25.020 --> 11:29.390
- I peel theirs.
- So if it isn't the new Commander

11:29.400 --> 11:32.560
who's grinding your gears, it's Bulkhead.

11:33.670 --> 11:38.000
Just burns me up when
a Wrecker goes soft.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.250
Look, Wheeljack.

11:39.250 --> 11:43.010
You'll always have the Wreckers
as you knew them, in here.

11:43.010 --> 11:45.110
Times change, players come and go,

11:45.110 --> 11:50.380
and if you can't adapt, you'll rust,
like the bones we're digging for.

11:51.850 --> 11:53.920
Don't push Bulkhead away.

11:53.920 --> 11:57.020
If something happened to him,
you'd never forgive yourself.

12:00.430 --> 12:03.890
Trust me, I know.

12:13.810 --> 12:17.470
<i>Knockout to base, requesting
groundbridge for the umpteenth time.</i>

12:17.480 --> 12:20.040
<i>Come in, base.</i>

12:20.050 --> 12:24.150
<i>Ohh. I can't drive
around all night... what?</i>

12:31.920 --> 12:33.720
<i>Watch the rims!</i>

12:38.000 --> 12:39.860
<i>Now!</i>

12:43.800 --> 12:46.470
Well, isn't that just grand?

12:51.980 --> 12:58.820
Did I say "grand"?
I meant totally rude.

12:58.820 --> 13:00.580
My optics!

13:19.810 --> 13:24.010
Oh!
Are we playing a human game now?

13:26.640 --> 13:28.180
Because I would be happy

13:28.180 --> 13:32.980
to teach you the Decepticon version:
"hide-and-go-shriek".

14:29.610 --> 14:33.080
June!
June, where are you?

14:38.680 --> 14:42.090
All right, little lady, show yourself.

14:42.090 --> 14:47.560
Or I turn the snappy dresser here
into a sloppy stain on the tarmac.

15:01.088 --> 15:02.840
<i>You've reached
special Agent William Fowler. </i>

15:02.840 --> 15:04.840
<i>Leave a message at
the star-spangled beep.</i>

15:05.640 --> 15:08.240
Straight to voicemail,
just like Mom's cell.

15:08.250 --> 15:10.610
Maybe they went to a movie?

15:12.580 --> 15:16.890
Okay. Running from Bulk,
shutting down like that,

15:16.890 --> 15:19.590
pretty spineless of me.

15:19.590 --> 15:23.330
On the bright side, you
have plenty of backbone now.

15:26.730 --> 15:29.200
<i>Arcee, I need your help.</i>

15:31.200 --> 15:34.670
My Mom and Fowler may
be in serious trouble.

15:39.240 --> 15:41.840
Last chance, she-human.

15:44.850 --> 15:47.720
If you're not out here with
my prize in 2.3 seconds,

15:47.720 --> 15:50.450
your boyfriend here...

15:55.790 --> 15:59.460
<i>Okay, first, not my boyfriend.</i>

16:00.930 --> 16:05.240
And second, you're not
laying a metal digit on him.

16:06.670 --> 16:09.970
Not if you ever want to see
your precious talon again.

16:12.780 --> 16:14.740
- Where is it?
- Leave her alone!

16:15.510 --> 16:20.680
I hid it on a train car.
Let us go, and I'll tell you which one.

16:31.430 --> 16:36.000
Try as you might, you can't con a 'Con.

16:47.880 --> 16:52.520
<i>Fasten your seatbelts.
It's going to be a bumpy ride.</i>

16:54.050 --> 16:58.050
<i>Oh, wait, you can't
unfasten your belts. My bad.</i>

17:02.530 --> 17:06.000
Communications have
been down for how long?!

17:06.000 --> 17:10.869
Soundwave practically has
the dish repaired, Master.

17:10.869 --> 17:13.599
<i>Which is all
well and good for Soundwave,</i>

17:13.609 --> 17:16.510
but for you...

17:16.510 --> 17:19.040
<i>Knockout to Lord Megatron,
please, come in.</i>

17:19.040 --> 17:21.880
See? All fixed.

17:21.880 --> 17:25.520
<i>Knockout, do you have the Predacon bone?</i>

17:25.520 --> 17:31.820
<i>In my sights, my liege. As are a
pair of Autobots riding my rear.</i>

17:31.820 --> 17:36.830
Understood. Just make sure
you secure the specimen.

18:39.960 --> 18:43.490
<i>Now, in which train car
would a Deceptive little human</i>

18:43.500 --> 18:45.830
<i>choose to bury a bone?</i>

18:49.800 --> 18:53.140
<i>My money's on the convertible.</i>

19:07.450 --> 19:09.950
Get Fowler and June!

19:24.640 --> 19:27.170
<i>Here's where you get out.</i>

19:43.550 --> 19:46.990
<i>Lord Megatron, if a groundbridge
doesn't open "tout de suite",</i>

19:46.990 --> 19:49.830
<i>your specimen will
belong to the Autobots.</i>

20:02.210 --> 20:04.210
Scrap.

20:07.240 --> 20:10.510
- Where are they?
- In back.

20:19.370 --> 20:21.210
Mom!

20:23.340 --> 20:24.880
Are you all right?

20:24.880 --> 20:30.120
The milk run turned a little sour,
but Bill and I are just fine.

20:30.120 --> 20:33.850
Come on, June, sit down.

20:33.860 --> 20:35.520
Bill?

20:35.520 --> 20:41.930
Looks like you've been jacked,
Jack, by another 'Jack.

20:51.870 --> 20:57.280
- Bro-mance trumps romance.
- Glad to be your bro, bro.

21:00.550 --> 21:03.550
<i>You have served me well today, Knockout.</i>

21:03.550 --> 21:07.490
which is more than I can say for some.

21:07.490 --> 21:12.020
It was the beast that disrupted
communications, my liege.

21:12.030 --> 21:16.200
<i>I beg you to reconsider project Predacon.</i>

21:16.200 --> 21:18.560
<i>The creature is incorrigible,</i>
