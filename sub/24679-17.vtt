In New York City's war on crime,

00:03.971 --> 00:06.144
the worst criminal offenders are pursued

00:06.206 --> 00:08.880
by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.

00:08.942 --> 00:10.818
These are their stories.

00:12.813 --> 00:16.556
Who does she think this is
going to fool? It's ridiculous.

00:16.984 --> 00:21.524
Maybe. But it contains all the
necessary elements of a valid codicil.

00:21.588 --> 00:23.090
It's not even his signature.

00:23.156 --> 00:25.602

for bed. I'll be in later.

Am I too late?

01:02.930 --> 01:04.876
No. Eloise, you're always just in time.

01:04.932 --> 01:06.878
Oliver showed me your so-called codicil.

01:06.934 --> 01:08.208
Everything's clear then.

01:08.268 --> 01:10.771
The only thing clear is how low you've sunk.

The Durning name is synonymous

02:12.332 --> 02:14.972
From my grandfather to my father to me.

02:15.836 --> 02:19.875
There are some in our family who would
like to split the Durning Foundation

02:19.940 --> 02:22.716
into so many little fingers.
But it is only as one

02:22.776 --> 02:25.279

Oh, hi. No, I just got here myself.

woman followed her in here.

04:22.562 --> 04:25.065
No description, just a brown leather coat.

04:25.132 --> 04:29.808
Well, it's a single cut
along the femoral artery.

04:29.870 --> 04:32.350
It's very precise, no hesitation marks.

04:32.405 --> 04:33.440
A pro.

04:33.507 --> 04:35.544
Her friend said that there was a purse.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.555
Well, it's not in here.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.957
She has soap on her hands. She...

04:43.650 --> 04:47.154
She'd already come out of the
stall, she was washing up.

04:47.587 --> 04:50.500
And the brown leather coat,

04:51.091 --> 04:53.503
after her purse, she followed
her in the bathroom.

04:53.560 --> 04:55.471
Miss Kittridge went into the stall...

04:55.529 --> 04:58.373
She hung her purse on the hook here.

04:59.766 --> 05:02.542
Leather coat would've just been
able to reach over and grab it.

05:02.602 --> 05:06.846
No, I think Miss Kittridge
probably just put it on the floor.

05:07.174 --> 05:08.915
No. She hung it up.

05:11.211 --> 05:14.556
Right. A girl thing.
So the purse is on the hook

05:16.783 --> 05:18.592
within easy reach.

05:19.653 --> 05:24.568
But leather coat waited
for her to leave the stall.

05:24.724 --> 05:26.431
This wasn't a robbery gone bad.

05:26.493 --> 05:28.530
It was a murder gone good.

05:29.429 --> 05:32.308
I called everyone on her emergency list.

05:32.499 --> 05:36.003
Her ex-husband's taking the first
flight out tomorrow from Minneapolis.

05:36.069 --> 05:37.605
Who else is on the list?

05:37.671 --> 05:40.811
Her lawyer, Mr. Broome, a couple of friends.

05:40.874 --> 05:42.649
She having any problems with anybody,

05:42.709 --> 05:44.347
maybe legal problems?

05:44.978 --> 05:47.424
No, nothing like that.

We'll be right there. And call the DA.

order bars an autopsy

06:16.977 --> 06:18.183

06:18.245 --> 06:20.191
of Miss Kittridge's body immediately.

06:20.247 --> 06:21.726
What did the DA say?

06:21.781 --> 06:23.260
To give the man what he wants.

06:23.316 --> 06:25.318
The remains aren't being destroyed.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.228
If a judge later rescinds the order,

06:27.287 --> 06:29.164
the body will be available for inspection.

06:29.522 --> 06:32.059
Where are they taking the body exactly?

06:32.125 --> 06:34.036
I am not at liberty to say.

Triple time.

06:44.771 --> 06:46.216
- Good for you.
- Yeah.

06:46.273 --> 06:47.911
What do you got in there? Dry ice?

06:48.575 --> 06:50.816
Must be taking her on
a hell of a road trip, huh?

06:50.877 --> 06:54.347
Just to JFK. And they got
a private jet waiting.

06:55.081 --> 06:56.958
- Private jet?
- Yeah.

06:57.017 --> 07:00.328
Man, even dead, these people
go first class, huh?

07:00.387 --> 07:01.388
Yep.

07:02.022 --> 07:03.695
All right. Thanks.

One for Mexico City,

07:10.463 --> 07:12.943
one for Seattle and one
for Scottsdale, Arizona.

07:12.999 --> 07:17.914
Now, I'm betting that Miss Kittridge
was on the one to Scottsdale.

07:18.171 --> 07:19.548
For the dry heat?

07:19.606 --> 07:21.813
No, for the freezing cold.

07:23.476 --> 07:25.012
Cryogenics.

07:28.815 --> 07:33.662
Scottsdale is the home of the largest
storage facility in the world.

07:34.821 --> 07:37.131
It's why they packed her in dry ice.

07:37.190 --> 07:40.694
It's why her lawyer got a court
order to prevent her autopsy.

07:40.760 --> 07:42.569
So she'll have all her fingers and toes

07:42.629 --> 07:45.542
when George Jetson defrosts her in the future.

07:46.032 --> 07:48.171
Maybe by then we'll be able
to tell her who killed her.

07:48.234 --> 07:50.043
Yeah, or who had her killed.

07:50.103 --> 07:52.276
That hearing in Surrogate's
Court this afternoon,

07:52.339 --> 07:54.512
It's Kittridge v. Kittridge.

07:54.674 --> 07:57.120
I can think of two Kittridges
who won't be there.

07:57.177 --> 07:58.520
Who does that leave?

08:01.982 --> 08:05.259
My father told me of his wish
to be interred at Arlington.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.992
We discussed the kind of
ceremony, who would attend.

08:08.054 --> 08:11.524
Your Honor, the Senator's wish was that
he be placed in suspended animation,

08:11.591 --> 08:14.538
so that he could be reunited with his
daughter at some point in the future.

08:14.594 --> 08:17.131
He never even mentioned cryogenics to me.

08:17.197 --> 08:20.576
Even the Senator's will stated that he
wanted to be interred at Arlington.

08:20.633 --> 08:23.045
Your Honor, that will was superseded

08:23.103 --> 08:25.276
by the codicil Miss Kittridge
presented to the court.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.249
Much as I loved my sister,

08:27.307 --> 08:30.845
it is clear that she was
exploiting my father's frailty.

08:31.244 --> 08:34.384
BROOME: He wasn't at the
signing. My client was.

08:34.614 --> 08:38.187
Since she's not here to authenticate
it, I must rely on the will of record.

08:38.251 --> 08:40.697
Therefore, I order that
Randolph Kittridge's body

08:40.754 --> 08:43.394
is to be disposed of
as stipulated in the will,

08:43.456 --> 08:46.494
and that it be released into custody
to his son, Jack Kittridge,

08:46.559 --> 08:49.096
for that purpose. We're adjourned.

Thank you.

08:53.900 --> 08:55.971
Mr. Kittridge, I'm Detective Eames,

08:56.036 --> 08:58.983
this is Detective Goren. We're
investigating your sister's murder.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.848
Oh, yes. I got your messages.

09:00.907 --> 09:01.942
It's okay.

09:02.008 --> 09:04.147
I appreciate everything that you're doing.

09:04.210 --> 09:06.451
Do you mind telling us
what just went on in here?

09:06.513 --> 09:08.459
Yeah, we just settled a minor dispute

09:08.515 --> 09:10.552
over the disposal of my father's remains.

09:10.617 --> 09:13.120
Your sister is gonna have a rude awakening.

09:13.186 --> 09:15.723
She's expecting your father
to be there waiting for her

09:15.789 --> 09:18.235
when she gets brought back to life.

09:20.493 --> 09:23.872
Eloise and I had different views
about what was appropriate.

09:23.930 --> 09:27.207
You mean, like, dipping your old
man in a vat of liquid nitrogen.

09:27.667 --> 09:30.705
That probably wouldn't be appropriate,

09:31.104 --> 09:34.677
especially if you're running
a senate campaign.

09:35.375 --> 09:38.379
I guess people might think
that you're from a family of

09:39.579 --> 09:40.956
fruitcakes.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.151
Well, it never came to that.

09:43.216 --> 09:44.627
It could've.

09:44.884 --> 09:46.795
Eloise had the codicil.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.923
If she were here she
could've authenticated it.

09:49.989 --> 09:52.230
Oh, but she's not, is she?

09:55.695 --> 09:58.801
I hope that you find the
people who killed my sister.

10:00.033 --> 10:02.240
Anything I can do, let me know.

10:03.636 --> 10:04.740
Good luck.

10:21.721 --> 10:23.598
CAUDILL: Those are the originals.

10:23.656 --> 10:25.294
There are no copies.

10:26.593 --> 10:28.402
You people are clear on my terms?

10:28.795 --> 10:30.035
Crystal.

10:30.330 --> 10:33.675
Let me ask you, the other material,

10:34.834 --> 10:36.507
you never told me why you wanted it.

10:37.670 --> 10:39.240
No, we didn't.

10:40.473 --> 10:43.511
Please accept my condolences
on the death of your sister.

10:51.151 --> 10:54.189
EAMES: The storage facility said the
sister made arrangements a year ago

10:54.254 --> 10:56.757
to have herself and her dad frozen.

10:56.823 --> 11:00.794
But Jack Kittridge didn't start
litigating to stop her until last month.

11:00.860 --> 11:02.430
If you're worried about bad publicity,

11:02.495 --> 11:03.838
what could be worse than a court fight

11:03.897 --> 11:05.934
with your sister over your old man's corpse?

11:05.999 --> 11:10.175
Well, he might have something else
to worry about besides publicity.

11:10.236 --> 11:13.183
The will said his father wanted to be
interred. I just talked to Arlington.

11:13.239 --> 11:15.219
Jack arranged for his father
to be interred all right,

11:15.275 --> 11:17.585
but not in the cemetery, in the crypt.

11:17.644 --> 11:18.850
The crypt?

11:18.912 --> 11:20.619
He's having him cremated.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.887
He had, as of an hour ago.

11:24.617 --> 11:27.723
Nothing like a 2,000 degree
fire to destroy evidence.

11:30.890 --> 11:32.528
Randolph died of lymphoma.

11:32.592 --> 11:34.503
He fought the cancer for 3 years.

11:34.594 --> 11:35.971
We thought he'd beat it,

11:36.029 --> 11:38.441
then I found a malignant polyp in his colon.

11:38.498 --> 11:41.001
Was he a candidate for
a bone marrow transplant?

11:41.067 --> 11:43.240
Well, yes. We were looking for a donor.

11:43.303 --> 11:44.680
The kids weren't a match?

11:44.737 --> 11:46.114
Well, Eloise wasn't.

11:46.172 --> 11:47.378
Jack was never tested.

11:47.440 --> 11:48.783
Afraid of needles?

11:48.841 --> 11:50.377
I have no idea.

11:50.476 --> 11:52.251
He did make several appointments, though.

11:52.312 --> 11:55.589
But he was always too busy,
because of the needles.

11:56.149 --> 11:57.526
Thank you, Doctor.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.766
Well, that leaves the other option.

12:03.656 --> 12:05.829
He was always too busy to get tested

12:05.892 --> 12:07.929
because he might not really be a Kittridge.

12:07.994 --> 12:10.702
I hear skeletons in the family closet.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.343
EAMES: You were assigned
to protect the Senator

12:17.403 --> 12:19.747
back around the time his son was born?

12:19.806 --> 12:21.444
Around then, yes.

12:21.941 --> 12:25.946
Well, the Senator, he campaigned
for LBJ's Civil Rights Act,

12:26.012 --> 12:28.652
and there were death threats
against him and his family.

12:29.282 --> 12:31.558
Mr. Manahan, this is from
the Senator's archives.

12:31.618 --> 12:33.996
The Secret Service agent at the door here,

12:34.053 --> 12:37.227
holding it for the Senator's
wife and little Eloise,

12:37.290 --> 12:38.291
is that you?

12:38.791 --> 12:40.134
Looks like it.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.470
So they were your primary assignment

12:42.528 --> 12:45.839
when the Senator would
go away to Washington?

12:46.332 --> 12:50.747
Yes, Mrs. K stayed up in Bedford with Eloise.

12:51.237 --> 12:52.841
She have any friends?

12:52.905 --> 12:56.751
Any special friends who visited
her up there in Bedford?

12:56.976 --> 13:00.287
Special friends she didn't want
her husband to know about.

13:01.748 --> 13:04.024
Mrs. K. loved the Senator very much.

13:04.083 --> 13:06.461
Sure. But you see,

13:06.519 --> 13:10.228
she was up there in Bedford all
alone for weeks at a time,

13:10.290 --> 13:12.167
and then her son was conceived.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.803
I'm not getting into gossip.

13:15.862 --> 13:19.605
You were reassigned just before Jack was born.

13:19.799 --> 13:23.542
Yeah, I was bored. I wanted to
be in DC where the action was.

13:25.805 --> 13:28.581
A different kind of action.

13:31.644 --> 13:35.285
Mr. Manahan, this old picture

13:35.848 --> 13:38.260
isn't a very good likeness of you.

13:40.086 --> 13:42.225
Now that I see you in person,

13:44.891 --> 13:46.302
your chin...

13:48.995 --> 13:50.303
Jack.

13:51.097 --> 13:52.838
Jack has your chin.

13:55.768 --> 13:57.577
I've gotta get to the store.

13:57.637 --> 14:02.143
Mr. Manahan, we think Jack was
afraid somebody might find out

14:02.208 --> 14:04.415
the Senator wasn't his biological father.

14:04.477 --> 14:06.650
That's why he had him cremated.

14:10.783 --> 14:12.228
No one knew.

14:13.453 --> 14:15.694
Not even the Senator. No one.

14:21.994 --> 14:24.167
Has your car been broken into recently?

14:25.832 --> 14:29.712
'Cause this tint here is

14:30.136 --> 14:33.083
less faded than the other glass.

14:33.172 --> 14:36.153
Has this glass been replaced recently?

14:36.209 --> 14:40.954
Yeah, about a month ago. Some neighborhood
punks, they smashed the window.

14:41.047 --> 14:42.685
What did they steal?

14:42.749 --> 14:45.923
Nothing really. The change in the ashtray.

14:46.586 --> 14:48.293
I see you have lip balm there.

14:48.354 --> 14:49.458
Yeah.

14:50.456 --> 14:51.662
They take that, too?

14:51.724 --> 14:54.068
Well, the one I had in there was missing.

14:54.127 --> 14:55.834
But I doubt that they stole it.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.307
I mean, a used stick of lip balm?

15:00.466 --> 15:04.414
Well, if it wasn't used, there'd
be no point in stealing it.

15:05.805 --> 15:08.251
Every time you put lip balm on your lips,

15:08.307 --> 15:10.844
you leave dry skin cells on the stick.

15:10.910 --> 15:14.517
That's what they were after,
to get Manahan's DNA to show

15:15.214 --> 15:17.387
that he was Jack's biological father.

15:17.483 --> 15:19.053
Jack got wind his secret's out.

15:19.118 --> 15:21.257
So he had the Senator's remains cremated.

15:21.320 --> 15:22.822
But by then, it's too late.

15:22.889 --> 15:24.527
The proof's already out there.

15:24.590 --> 15:27.161
2 weeks after Manahan's car got broken into,

15:27.226 --> 15:31.436
Jack filed suit to keep Eloise
from freezing her father.

15:31.831 --> 15:35.142
They used the DNA to blackmail
Jack into filing a suit.

15:35.201 --> 15:37.181
Somebody didn't want that body preserved.

15:40.139 --> 15:44.519
Or, they wanted something from the body.

15:45.845 --> 15:50.385
Something a reanimated Senator Kittridge

15:51.384 --> 15:55.127
couldn't live without, you
know, 100 years from now.

15:59.759 --> 16:02.365
They brought Mr. Kittridge
here right after he died

16:02.428 --> 16:05.238
and we cooled him down to 5 degrees Celsius.

16:05.298 --> 16:07.300
They wanted him shipped
to a cryogenic facility,

16:07.366 --> 16:09.107
but there was a legal hang-up

16:09.168 --> 16:12.149
and we ended up sending him to a crematorium.

16:12.205 --> 16:14.151
After you prepared him for cremation?

16:14.207 --> 16:16.983
Not me. The family brought
in their own pathologist

16:17.043 --> 16:20.923
out of concern for Mr. Kittridge's
dignity, which I totally get.

16:21.180 --> 16:24.684
GOREN: Do you remember what the instruments
looked like that the pathologist used?

16:24.750 --> 16:26.058
I saw him set up.

16:26.118 --> 16:29.099
He had scalpels, and retractors,

16:29.489 --> 16:32.402
and a few instruments I'm not familiar with.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.938
Well, you'd remember what they looked like.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.974
I mean, you could sketch them.

16:37.697 --> 16:39.574
We can work over here.

16:40.466 --> 16:42.377
Put it on the plane to Geneva.

16:42.435 --> 16:45.245
The lab will be up and running
by tomorrow morning.

16:48.207 --> 16:49.743
Sorry for the interruption.

16:49.809 --> 16:51.254
No, your son was just telling us

16:51.310 --> 16:53.847
about your vaccine program in Africa.

16:53.913 --> 16:55.620
That was all Nick's idea.

16:57.383 --> 17:00.296
So have you decided what you're doing today?

17:00.520 --> 17:03.023
Yes, I'm gonna take my parents
up to Connecticut for the night,

17:03.089 --> 17:04.159
show them the house.

17:04.223 --> 17:06.328
My grandfather used to
take me fishing up there,

17:06.392 --> 17:10.169
to a little lake just outside of...
Outside... Outside...

17:10.229 --> 17:11.263
Litchfield.

17:11.329 --> 17:15.073
Katie says there's a room that
would be perfect for a nursery.

17:16.435 --> 17:17.914
Fantastic.

17:19.405 --> 17:21.385
Nick and Katie,

17:21.807 --> 17:24.583
your engagement has made an old man happy.

17:25.211 --> 17:27.213
Extremely happy.

17:27.914 --> 17:31.418
Welcome to the family, all of you.

17:40.927 --> 17:42.338
Stryker saw.

17:48.034 --> 17:49.638
A bone mallet.

17:50.603 --> 17:55.018
This one is a malleable retractor.

17:55.207 --> 17:58.051
All this to remove a penile implant.

17:58.110 --> 18:00.454
Imagine what it took to put it in.

18:00.513 --> 18:02.857
They weren't removing an implant.

18:05.551 --> 18:09.021
"Using a Stryker saw
to cut through the calva..."

18:09.088 --> 18:10.863
it's the top half of the skull.

18:10.923 --> 18:13.597
"...the skull cap can be pried loose
by twisting a t-shaped chisel

18:13.659 --> 18:17.766
"along the saw cut and tapping
it gently with a bone mallet."

18:17.830 --> 18:19.867
They cut open his skull?

18:20.232 --> 18:22.234
"If the dura membrane is tightly adhered,

18:22.301 --> 18:25.180
"a malleable retractor will
separate it from the brain."

18:28.374 --> 18:30.820
Don't tell me they took his brain.

18:36.415 --> 18:39.692
There's nothing in Kittridge's file
about any neurological disorders.

18:39.752 --> 18:41.595
Nothing that would make
his brain worth studying.

18:41.654 --> 18:42.860
A politician's brain?

18:42.922 --> 18:46.301
Maybe they wanted to see how he talked
out of both sides of his mouth.

18:46.792 --> 18:49.136
Well, is there anything unique
about brain cell DNA?

18:49.195 --> 18:52.301
Nah. it's all the same DNA from head to toe.

18:52.365 --> 18:54.311
They could have used hair or blood.

18:55.101 --> 18:56.705
But they didn't.

18:57.336 --> 19:00.249
Something has to be
remarkable about that brain,

19:00.306 --> 19:02.684
enough to interest someone with the will

19:02.742 --> 19:06.690
and the resources to blackmail Jack
Kittridge and kill his sister.

19:06.746 --> 19:08.089
It's gotta be for research.

19:08.147 --> 19:11.321
Well, they'd need a university-grade
lab, at the very least.

19:11.384 --> 19:14.456
The Senator's doctor removed
a polyp from his colon.

19:14.520 --> 19:16.898
- They did a biopsy. Do you...
- Yeah.

19:16.956 --> 19:19.800
6 months ago. At the York Institute.

19:20.559 --> 19:22.266
Senator Kittridge's polyp was used

19:22.328 --> 19:25.036
in a study on the genetics
of neurological disorders.

19:25.097 --> 19:28.374
Well, his medical file doesn't mention
he had a neurological disorder.

19:28.434 --> 19:29.469
Well, he didn't.

19:29.535 --> 19:31.776
The study collected tissue
from all their patients,

19:31.837 --> 19:35.876
to look for chromosomal anomalies known
to cause a whole host of disorders.

19:35.941 --> 19:37.887
Any anomalies on Senator Kittridge?

19:37.943 --> 19:39.650
Oh, I'm afraid that's confidential.

19:39.712 --> 19:42.192
Well, we'll just read the published paper.

19:42.348 --> 19:44.089
There was no paper.

19:44.583 --> 19:47.587
The study was terminated. The funding ran out.

19:47.653 --> 19:49.963
We'll guess the funding "ran out"

19:50.022 --> 19:51.933
when somebody pulled the plug.

19:51.991 --> 19:54.870
Maybe because of some
negligence by the hospital?

19:55.528 --> 19:57.701
There was nothing we could've
done to protect ourselves.

19:57.763 --> 19:59.242
Against what?

19:59.865 --> 20:04.041
Three months ago, someone hacked into our
computer and retrieved personal data

20:04.103 --> 20:05.275
on the tissue donors.

20:05.504 --> 20:07.245
Matching names and tissue samples?

20:07.306 --> 20:08.341
Yes.

20:08.407 --> 20:11.354
After the security breach, the
Durning Foundation pulled out.

20:13.379 --> 20:15.017
They funded the study?

20:15.081 --> 20:17.220
Yes. They threatened to sue.

20:17.650 --> 20:19.152
They even sent their own people here

20:19.218 --> 20:21.164
to destroy the data we'd collected.

20:22.021 --> 20:25.468
Spencer Durning himself
called me. I was shocked.

20:29.762 --> 20:32.174
We fund over 800 projects a year.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.733
There are equally deserving programs

20:33.799 --> 20:35.608
that are more competently run.

20:35.901 --> 20:38.279
Senator Kittridge would be disappointed

20:38.370 --> 20:42.182
his polyp didn't get to save mankind
from some terrible disease.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.278
It was part of the study, did you know that?

20:44.343 --> 20:46.516
No, I didn't. How would I?

20:47.012 --> 20:48.753
GOREN: Well, you wouldn't. It's a…

20:48.814 --> 20:50.760
well, you know, funny coincidence.

20:50.816 --> 20:54.923
Your foundation prepared a report on
cryogenics for the Senator's son.

20:54.987 --> 20:56.660
It was Exhibit "L"

20:56.856 --> 20:59.234
in his suit against his sister.

20:59.291 --> 21:01.965
The Foundation had studies on the subject.

21:02.027 --> 21:04.940
Jack Kittridge's lawyer
approached us for help.

21:04.997 --> 21:07.705
Randolph Kittridge was a great American.

21:07.933 --> 21:10.846
He deserves better than to spend
eternity hanging by his ankles

21:10.903 --> 21:12.211
in a tub of nitrogen.

21:12.271 --> 21:15.616
Come on. It was an act
of love by his daughter.

21:19.145 --> 21:22.592
I mean, what if your son...

21:25.851 --> 21:26.886
Your son...

21:26.952 --> 21:28.454
Yes, Nicholas.

21:29.188 --> 21:31.225
What if your son Nicholas,

21:31.724 --> 21:36.070
preserved your body for the day
where they came up with a cure for,

21:36.796 --> 21:38.673
well, whatever killed you.

21:39.064 --> 21:42.409
Cryogenics is pie-in-the-sky
science. My son knows better.

21:42.468 --> 21:44.778
I mean, you'd be worth bringing back.

21:44.837 --> 21:46.680
I don't plan on dying.

21:51.477 --> 21:53.354
Maybe it would've been

21:54.780 --> 21:59.229
a greater act of love to donate
the Senator's body to science.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.662
EAMES: Especially if there was
something unique about him.

22:01.720 --> 22:04.929
Something that came out during the
research at the York Institute.

22:08.327 --> 22:10.034
Is that why you helped Jack Kittridge?

22:10.095 --> 22:12.302
Mr. Durning already answered that question.

22:12.865 --> 22:16.403
He said that the Senator was a great American.

22:18.971 --> 22:21.281
(STUTTERING)
I mean, you can't really believe that,

22:21.340 --> 22:22.648
I mean, for a minute, can you?

22:22.708 --> 22:25.689
I mean, don't get me
started on politics. It's...

22:26.645 --> 22:30.559
I mean, you know, his marriage
was the great American joke.

22:30.616 --> 22:32.357
He cheated on his wife,
his wife cheated on him...

22:32.418 --> 22:33.863
I meant his public life.

22:33.919 --> 22:35.728
His service to the country.

22:35.788 --> 22:37.790
He wimped out on the country.

22:37.857 --> 22:41.828
Ran for presidency in '76, dropped
out before the first primary.

22:42.127 --> 22:43.765
I mean, there were rumors of drugs and...

22:43.829 --> 22:45.308
Oh, no, that was ridiculous.

22:45.364 --> 22:48.971
No. No, I saw it on TV. He started crying

22:49.034 --> 22:51.480
right in the middle of
one of his press conferences.

22:51.537 --> 22:54.848
The guy couldn't get though one
speech without losing his place.

22:54.907 --> 22:57.888
He always forgot facts. I mean,
it's like, the guy didn't, you know,

22:57.943 --> 22:59.616
know where he was.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.190
You know, half the time.

23:08.487 --> 23:12.799
As I remember, he was suffering from
exhaustion and he needed a rest.

23:14.860 --> 23:19.138
We've faced an unrelenting barrage of slurs.

23:21.100 --> 23:25.515
My wife Maureen, and my children

23:26.205 --> 23:29.709
Eloise and Jack, don't deserve this.

23:34.380 --> 23:36.053
It's not worth it,

23:38.617 --> 23:40.893
so I am withdrawing my name as a candidate

23:40.953 --> 23:43.229
for the presidency of the United States.

23:44.657 --> 23:48.503
Here's another one from the
Boston Herald in January '76.

23:48.661 --> 23:51.870
"Kittridge wandered off the stage
in the middle of a fundraiser.

23:51.931 --> 23:53.672
"His wife said he had the flu."

23:53.732 --> 23:55.473
Must have been some flu.

23:55.534 --> 23:58.708
Senator, do you support the Supreme
Court's ruling in Roe v. Wade?

24:00.339 --> 24:02.580
(WHISPERING)
If elected, I will uphold the law of the land.

24:02.641 --> 24:04.712
If elected, I will uphold the law of the land.

24:04.777 --> 24:07.951
It's been a long day. Our children
are waiting for us. Thank you.

24:09.014 --> 24:10.687
I remember this puppet show.

24:10.749 --> 24:12.387
Everybody thought he was stoned.

24:12.451 --> 24:15.625
Well, his eyes aren't glassy,
his speech isn't slurred.

24:15.721 --> 24:17.394
But he is completely disoriented.

24:17.456 --> 24:19.959
There's nothing in his record, not even a DUI.

24:20.025 --> 24:22.767
And no hint of a substance
abuse problem in his files

24:22.828 --> 24:24.239
or of a nervous breakdown.

24:24.296 --> 24:28.540
Kittridge had unprovoked mood
swings, he had memory losses,

24:28.600 --> 24:30.807
he neglected his appearance.

24:32.171 --> 24:35.618
His lapses, they took place late in the day

24:35.708 --> 24:38.484
and they got worse over a period of months.

24:38.544 --> 24:42.082
You're describing my old man.
Except he has Alzheimer's.

24:42.881 --> 24:46.727
Well, maybe Kittridge did, too, in '76.

24:47.987 --> 24:49.796
But he was only what? 40, 42?

24:49.855 --> 24:50.959
43.

24:53.092 --> 24:57.666
There's a rare form of the disease,
it's called early-onset Alzheimer's.

24:57.730 --> 25:00.142
It's genetically-transmitted,

25:00.199 --> 25:02.679
strikes people in their 30s and 40s.

25:02.735 --> 25:06.239
Except a year later, Kittridge went back
to the senate, and he was sharp as a tack

25:06.305 --> 25:08.182
until he resigned 8 years ago.

25:08.240 --> 25:11.585
And as far as I know there's
no cure for Alzheimer's.

25:11.977 --> 25:13.388
There isn't.

25:14.980 --> 25:17.256
Somehow, Kittridge recovered.

25:17.316 --> 25:19.762
And that would make him
some kind of medical miracle.

25:19.818 --> 25:22.025
And his brain worth studying.

25:23.355 --> 25:26.666
Well, it would account
for all the bad behavior

25:26.725 --> 25:29.171
if someone desperate enough

25:29.561 --> 25:32.132
thought that it held a key to a cure.

25:33.399 --> 25:34.776
LYNDON: I'm sorry for interrupting,

25:34.833 --> 25:36.369
but he keeps trying to run outside.

25:36.435 --> 25:37.675
He says he's late for school.

25:37.736 --> 25:39.477
His afternoon pills are still here.

25:39.538 --> 25:41.074
He forgot to take them.

25:41.140 --> 25:42.483
He forgot?

25:42.641 --> 25:44.450
That's what he does. He forgets.

25:44.510 --> 25:46.183
It's your job to remember.

25:51.583 --> 25:54.120
Come on. Let's go to bed.

25:54.186 --> 25:55.460
But I'm gonna miss the bus.

25:55.521 --> 25:56.795
I'm gonna be late for school.

25:56.855 --> 25:59.631
No, it's not time to go to school, Nicky.

25:59.691 --> 26:02.535
It's time for good little boys to be in bed.

26:10.869 --> 26:13.008
Now we're gonna take our vitamins.

26:26.952 --> 26:28.556
Take a big gulp.

26:31.156 --> 26:32.692
That's my boy.

26:41.934 --> 26:44.380
Everything's gonna be fine, Nicky.

26:45.971 --> 26:48.076
Everything's gonna be fine.

26:52.144 --> 26:53.555
Alzheimer's?

26:55.747 --> 26:58.921
But he held office. He chaired committees.

26:59.184 --> 27:00.424
He recovered.

27:01.487 --> 27:04.866
Against all odds, against
conventional medical wisdom.

27:05.057 --> 27:06.593
CARVER: Certain people found out.

27:06.658 --> 27:09.502
For their own reasons, they wanted
to study your father's brain,

27:09.561 --> 27:14.135
so they blackmailed you
to get access to his remains.

27:14.199 --> 27:17.180
Well, that's absurd. Blackmail about what?

27:18.570 --> 27:22.074
We know about your mother's indiscretion.

27:23.876 --> 27:26.015
GOREN: Who got to you, Jack?

27:26.478 --> 27:27.718
Spencer Durning?

27:28.447 --> 27:32.190
He's ruthless enough to kill
to get what he wants.

27:34.720 --> 27:36.165
Your sister.

27:37.222 --> 27:38.895
They didn't tell you?

27:39.458 --> 27:43.531
You wanna see what a neat
surgical job they did on her?

27:47.399 --> 27:49.174
Don't even consider stonewalling

27:49.234 --> 27:51.874
to save your campaign.
We have enough to indict.

27:51.970 --> 27:53.972
This is just a courtesy.

27:55.307 --> 27:57.446
It's a complete fabrication.

27:58.810 --> 28:02.019
There isn't a grain of truth
to these allegations.

28:11.156 --> 28:13.762
Consider your bluff called.

28:15.794 --> 28:18.240
Maybe it's you who's wrong about Mr. Durning.

28:18.363 --> 28:21.207
Why would a man like him

28:21.266 --> 28:24.304
use such desperate measures to steal an organ?

28:24.736 --> 28:26.647
Because he is desperate

28:27.206 --> 28:30.016
to save his only child, his son Nicholas.

28:30.375 --> 28:34.016
He is the right age for
the onset of the disease.

28:34.479 --> 28:36.152
CARVER: Then why all the secrecy?

28:36.782 --> 28:39.092
They don't want anyone to find out.

28:40.485 --> 28:42.522
For the last 4 years,

28:42.588 --> 28:45.398
he's been fighting with relatives

28:45.624 --> 28:48.798
to keep them from carving up
the family foundation.

28:48.860 --> 28:51.238
Now, he's been able to fend them off

28:51.296 --> 28:54.277
by naming his son as the sole successor.

28:54.366 --> 28:56.403
Which wouldn't do him any good
if everybody found out

28:56.468 --> 28:58.812
his heir apparent had Alzheimer's.

28:59.605 --> 29:01.642
He can't hide it for long.

29:02.708 --> 29:04.619
Maybe he won't have to.

29:07.045 --> 29:09.025
Nicholas had a shipmate.

29:12.618 --> 29:15.690
Nick didn't tell me he
gave his dad that photo.

29:15.754 --> 29:17.995
It was taken last summer off Block Island.

29:18.056 --> 29:20.332
On your brother's boat.
That's how we found you.

29:20.392 --> 29:23.339
Don't worry, your brother didn't tell
us that you and Nick were engaged.

29:23.395 --> 29:26.672
We found that out on our own. Why else would

29:27.165 --> 29:29.475
his dad keep your picture on his desk?

29:30.402 --> 29:32.109
Maybe I should call Mr. Durning.

29:32.170 --> 29:36.619
Must be intimidating marrying into
a rich family with all their,

29:37.709 --> 29:39.655
well, rules and secrecy.

29:41.513 --> 29:43.254
Is Nick in trouble?

29:43.849 --> 29:46.022
Would you be surprised if he was?

29:46.318 --> 29:48.127
Nick's a very honest person.

29:48.186 --> 29:50.462
Well, you wouldn't marry him if he weren't

29:51.523 --> 29:53.764
or have kids with him.

29:54.960 --> 29:57.770
You do plan on having kids with him, right?

29:58.797 --> 30:00.470
We both want children.

30:00.532 --> 30:02.170
Well, that's great.

30:02.267 --> 30:04.611
And you live in different cities.

30:06.104 --> 30:07.845
How's that working out for you?

30:08.340 --> 30:12.083
Nick flies me to New York every
week or so to spend the day.

30:13.912 --> 30:17.359
Meaning, in the... In the daytime.

30:17.783 --> 30:19.490
What do you do in the evenings?

30:19.551 --> 30:21.929
Nick gets very tired in the evening.

30:22.521 --> 30:25.161
He has a medical condition.

30:26.058 --> 30:29.904
Cerebral aneurysm. It's not life-threatening.

30:30.128 --> 30:32.267
Is that what he told you, he had an aneurysm?

30:32.531 --> 30:33.601
Yes.

30:34.633 --> 30:37.079
He'll probably have surgery after the wedding.

30:38.403 --> 30:41.384
EAMES: The ME said if he had an
aneurysm, he'd have headaches,

30:41.440 --> 30:43.681
dizziness, not just fatigue.

30:43.842 --> 30:46.755
GOREN: That's why he doesn't
see her in the evenings,

30:46.812 --> 30:49.122
'cause in the early stages of Alzheimer's,

30:49.715 --> 30:52.286
that's when the symptoms
appear. He lied to her.

30:52.351 --> 30:55.457
Or he did tell her he has Alzheimer's
and she's keeping the secret.

30:55.520 --> 30:58.797
The disease is inherited.
Nick could pass it to their kids.

30:58.924 --> 31:03.066
I can't imagine any woman having
children under those circumstances.

31:03.562 --> 31:07.772
So Spencer Durning and his son
are deceiving this poor woman

31:07.833 --> 31:10.245
just to produce an heir?

31:10.802 --> 31:12.645
No. A spare.

31:13.105 --> 31:14.812
If they can't find a cure for Nicholas,

31:14.873 --> 31:16.250
Durning will use this grandchild

31:16.308 --> 31:18.481
to retain the control over the Foundation.

31:19.211 --> 31:22.192
That would be detestable.
And so far, unprovable.

31:22.948 --> 31:24.894
Will a show-and-tell help?

31:29.254 --> 31:31.461
It's our turn to call a bluff.

31:32.424 --> 31:35.030
If I haven't committed any
crime, why am I under arrest?

31:35.093 --> 31:38.233
You'll have to ask the DA. He's the
one who got the material witness warrant.

31:38.330 --> 31:39.775
Oh, I'm a witness? To what?

31:39.831 --> 31:40.969
Ask the DA.

31:41.032 --> 31:43.376
He just wants to make sure
you show up to testify.

31:43.435 --> 31:45.210
Once you post bail, you can go home.

31:45.270 --> 31:46.476
When do I see a judge?

31:46.538 --> 31:48.176
Sometime tonight.

31:49.508 --> 31:50.851
Wheels of justice.

31:50.909 --> 31:53.048
This is incredible. Can I at
least make a phone call?

31:53.111 --> 31:54.852
Your dad's already been contacted.

31:54.913 --> 31:57.985
We can contact your fiancée,
if you want us to.

31:59.217 --> 32:01.060
Tell her that you're okay.

32:01.119 --> 32:03.065
You know, just give us her number.

32:03.355 --> 32:04.891
You already have the number.

32:04.956 --> 32:07.163
She told me you went to
Providence to talk to her.

32:07.225 --> 32:08.533
You're not worried,

32:13.064 --> 32:14.372
given your condition?

32:16.067 --> 32:19.640
Your aneurysm. Katie told
us that you got tired.

32:20.005 --> 32:22.986
The judge will ask you questions,
you'll have to answer them.

32:23.041 --> 32:25.112
Yeah, so I'll answer them.

32:25.310 --> 32:28.848
Look, I won't be at my best, but so what?

32:28.914 --> 32:31.224
So they know I have an aneurysm.

32:34.786 --> 32:37.665
The doctors that diagnosed you,

32:37.722 --> 32:39.895
they work for the Durning Foundation?

32:40.058 --> 32:41.128
Yes.

32:41.960 --> 32:45.999
Anyway, I take medication. I have
it with me. It's in my briefcase.

32:47.532 --> 32:49.273
There's no problem.

32:50.035 --> 32:52.242
If he has Alzheimer's,
the symptoms will show up

32:52.304 --> 32:53.908
by the time he appears at the hearing.

32:53.972 --> 32:56.384
If he's worried about people
finding out, he doesn't look it.

32:56.441 --> 32:57.977
Maybe because he has an aneurysm.

32:58.043 --> 32:59.420
SPENCER: Where's my son?

32:59.478 --> 33:00.718
I wanna see him now.

33:00.779 --> 33:02.122
Let me handle it, Spencer.

33:02.180 --> 33:03.716
Then handle it. Get him out.

33:03.782 --> 33:05.693
I wanna see this material witness order.

33:05.750 --> 33:08.128
If you wanna challenge
it, you can file a writ.

33:08.186 --> 33:10.757
I want my son home within the hour.

33:10.856 --> 33:12.426
That's not gonna happen, Mr. Durning.

33:12.491 --> 33:15.768
But for sure by this
evening, at the earliest.

33:16.261 --> 33:18.400
What the hell are you waiting
for? File the damn writ.

33:18.463 --> 33:20.568
I am not leaving without my son.

33:20.632 --> 33:23.238
Why don't we wait in my office, Mr. Durning.

33:28.807 --> 33:31.845
Now, that's a man who's worried and looks it.

33:31.910 --> 33:33.287
EAMES: Hmm.

34:11.550 --> 34:13.962
Let's get Nick into interrogation.

34:17.755 --> 34:20.998
Where is he? Why do you have him in there?

34:21.092 --> 34:22.935
Where we had him was noisy and busy.

34:22.994 --> 34:25.235
This is more quiet, less stressful.

34:25.830 --> 34:28.902
Wouldn't want him to get stressed
out on account of his aneurysm.

34:32.304 --> 34:33.373
He told us all about it.

34:33.438 --> 34:35.315
You know you can't talk to
him without his lawyer.

34:35.373 --> 34:38.149
On the contrary, he's a
witness, not a suspect.

34:38.208 --> 34:40.120
GOREN: Nick is looking a little peaked.

34:40.178 --> 34:42.954
I got him something to eat.

34:43.114 --> 34:44.752
That'll perk him up.

34:44.815 --> 34:47.659
Oh! And the meds.

34:48.887 --> 34:50.696
One or the other ought to do the trick.

34:51.156 --> 34:54.000
I have to talk to my son.
I insist on talking to him.

34:54.059 --> 34:57.370
Can't allow that. But you can listen in.

34:59.764 --> 35:01.539
GOREN: How are you holding up?

35:01.600 --> 35:03.910
I'm a little tired, but I'll be okay.

35:08.773 --> 35:13.279
I brought your pills. I mean,
you can't take them yet.

35:13.345 --> 35:16.087
There's a protocol that we have to follow

35:18.316 --> 35:21.422
just so that we know that they're
exactly what you say that they are.

35:24.089 --> 35:26.035
GOREN: And I'll just look it up.

35:27.058 --> 35:31.370
I mean, you wouldn't believe the
things that people try and pull on us.

35:32.197 --> 35:33.767
"Dexamethasone."

35:33.832 --> 35:36.039
Yeah, it's an anti-inflammatory.

35:36.101 --> 35:37.136
Right.

35:37.202 --> 35:39.978
"Dexamethasone, anti-inflammatory,

35:40.038 --> 35:43.781
"for the treatment of cerebral aneurysm."

35:58.657 --> 35:59.897
Well, what's wrong?

36:01.226 --> 36:03.467
Well, you can see in the book here that...

36:04.462 --> 36:06.635
That it shows...

36:07.065 --> 36:09.841
It has pictures of exactly
what the pill is, but...

36:10.135 --> 36:12.479
And your pill doesn't look
anything like the one

36:12.904 --> 36:17.410
in the book. You can see that the one in
the book is blue, and yours is yellow.

36:17.642 --> 36:19.815
Yes, I don't understand.

36:21.146 --> 36:23.057
Well, that's two of us.

36:23.715 --> 36:25.592
Who fills your prescriptions?

36:25.650 --> 36:27.926
I get them through my doctors' office.

36:27.986 --> 36:30.398
The doctors who work for
your father's foundation.

36:30.455 --> 36:31.525
Yes.

36:37.228 --> 36:38.400
I'll be right back.

36:38.463 --> 36:40.807
Well, you just keep looking through the book.

36:49.441 --> 36:51.546
How long do you think it's gonna take him

36:51.609 --> 36:56.456
to find out that the pills your doctors
are giving him aren't for an aneurysm?

36:56.514 --> 36:58.289
You don't know what you're talking about.

36:58.349 --> 36:59.885
If anything happens to my son

36:59.951 --> 37:01.931
because you denied him his medications...

37:02.020 --> 37:05.058
Yeah, I think he just found one.

37:06.124 --> 37:08.502
I've gotta get in there.
I have to talk to him.

37:12.464 --> 37:13.465
Dad.

37:13.531 --> 37:16.137
Nick, you're gonna be all right.

37:16.701 --> 37:18.180
Tom's working to get you out.

37:18.236 --> 37:20.341
You'll be home soon, you can rest.

37:20.405 --> 37:22.908
Never mind what they say.
You can take your medications.

37:22.974 --> 37:26.478
No, but there's something wrong
with it. There's a mix-up.

37:26.544 --> 37:27.784
We'll sort that out later.

37:27.846 --> 37:29.291
Did you find that pill in there?

37:29.347 --> 37:34.023
Yes. It's lorazepam. It's
an anti-anxiety drug.

37:34.085 --> 37:35.393
Are you sure?

37:35.453 --> 37:36.830
Why would they prescribe that?

37:36.888 --> 37:39.061
Maybe you should look up those other pills.

37:39.224 --> 37:41.704
No, this is a waste of time.
Now just give me the book.

37:41.760 --> 37:44.570
Dad, Dad, why are you being like this?

37:45.263 --> 37:48.005
I think he has a right to
know what drugs he's taking.

37:48.066 --> 37:51.138
Here, the dexamethasone.

37:51.202 --> 37:53.648
Nick, these people are not your friends.

37:57.008 --> 37:59.648
I can see why you picked
him as your successor.

37:59.944 --> 38:01.116
What?

38:01.179 --> 38:03.455
Well, his spirit. He knows his own mind.

38:03.515 --> 38:07.258
If not him, then one of those grand-kids
you're dying to get your hands on.

38:08.052 --> 38:09.690
GOREN: Did you find something, Nick?

38:10.655 --> 38:14.034
Well, this... Well, this can't be right.

38:14.459 --> 38:15.904
What does it say?

38:17.862 --> 38:21.605
It's a drug called donezepil. It's...

38:22.200 --> 38:24.544
it's for people with Alzheimer's.

38:24.602 --> 38:26.604
I'm sure it has many other uses.

38:26.671 --> 38:29.208
No. It just says Alzheimer's.

38:29.307 --> 38:33.585
This is idiotic. Why don't we wait
until we can consult with the doctors?

38:36.714 --> 38:39.194
GOREN: Now, it makes sense.

38:40.218 --> 38:44.633
They prescribe anti-anxiety pills
to people with Alzheimer's.

38:47.392 --> 38:49.838
Why are they giving me these drugs?

38:52.864 --> 38:54.901
Maybe you should tell him.

38:57.869 --> 38:59.610
I have Alzheimer's?

39:03.208 --> 39:07.054
A rare form called early-onset Alzheimer's.

39:12.283 --> 39:13.956
How long have you known?

39:17.455 --> 39:19.560
I'd say six to eight months.

39:19.824 --> 39:22.168
He's been keeping it under wraps,

39:23.127 --> 39:28.042
so no one will know that the
future of the Durning Foundation

39:28.800 --> 39:34.307
was in the hands of someone whose
mind is slowly slipping away.

39:37.208 --> 39:39.085
I had a right to know.

39:41.579 --> 39:45.254
Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you tell me?

39:45.316 --> 39:48.126
Because then he wouldn't get the grand-kids

39:48.620 --> 39:51.499
that he's counting on taking your place.

39:53.024 --> 39:55.868
See, Nick, your disease, it's inherited.

39:55.927 --> 39:58.373
And you, you have a conscience.

39:58.496 --> 40:01.966
Now, you wouldn't wanna play Russian
roulette with the future of your kids.

40:02.667 --> 40:04.908
But your father, he would.

40:05.503 --> 40:07.540
He'd sacrifice them,

40:07.605 --> 40:10.176
your fiancée, you

40:11.843 --> 40:14.619
on the altar of his grandiosity.

40:14.679 --> 40:18.388
That's a lie. There's hope,
Nick. There are precedents.

40:18.449 --> 40:21.259
I am moving heaven and earth
to find a treatment.

40:21.319 --> 40:24.163
We're a year or two, maybe even months away.

40:24.222 --> 40:27.863
He's right. He's right about that
one thing. There is a precedent.

40:28.526 --> 40:32.997
Senator Randolph Kittridge, he got
Alzheimer's when he was 42 and he beat it.

40:33.064 --> 40:35.408
He went on to have a brilliant career.

40:35.466 --> 40:37.446
- But it was a fluke.
- No.

40:37.502 --> 40:41.382
- It was an aberration with no
scientific value.
- No, no, no.

40:41.439 --> 40:43.578
We can learn from that case.

40:43.641 --> 40:45.314
He's already written you off.

40:45.376 --> 40:47.754
- Go to hell!
- Listen to me, Nick.

40:48.212 --> 40:53.628
My team is on the verge of isolating
the mechanism in his brain

40:54.085 --> 40:58.056
that produced high levels
of the APoE2 protein.

40:58.122 --> 40:59.692
That's the key.

40:59.991 --> 41:02.904
You found high levels of E2
in Kittridge's brain?

41:02.961 --> 41:04.235
Yes! Yes!

41:18.109 --> 41:21.818
I guess all that blackmail and
murder is paying off after all.

41:22.380 --> 41:26.760
Kittridge's daughter had other
plans for her father's brain.

41:28.987 --> 41:32.298
So your Dad had her killed.

41:40.765 --> 41:43.837
Don't you dare look at me like that!

41:44.469 --> 41:46.278
You know where you got that disease!

41:46.337 --> 41:48.283
Those weak genes from your Mother.

41:48.339 --> 41:50.785
I had to fix what she did to you.

41:51.576 --> 41:53.556
And if I did anything wrong, damn it,

41:53.611 --> 41:55.284
I did it for you, for your future!

41:55.346 --> 41:57.553
- His future?
- Your future!

41:57.615 --> 41:59.526
You don't plan on dying, remember?

41:59.584 --> 42:02.531
You wanna be immortal. You got to be immortal.

42:02.820 --> 42:04.959
And not in a tub of nitrogen.

42:05.023 --> 42:08.835
No, your vessel to eternity
is the Durning Foundation.

42:09.193 --> 42:12.299
To carry your legacy burning
bright through the centuries.

42:12.363 --> 42:15.867
No, it's not enough for you to
be humanitarian of the year.

42:15.933 --> 42:19.039
You got to be humanitarian
of the millennium.

42:22.940 --> 42:24.419
Shame on you.

42:27.478 --> 42:29.014
Humanitarian

42:29.147 --> 42:32.424
to everything and everyone,

42:33.551 --> 42:35.360
except your son.

42:36.754 --> 42:38.700
Your son's tragedy.

42:41.225 --> 42:46.174
Because, Spence, however much
you may like humanity,

42:48.132 --> 42:50.237
it's people that you can't stand.

42:51.302 --> 42:54.749
EAMES: Spencer Durning, you're
under arrest for murder.

43:08.252 --> 43:11.461
Worst thing that can happen to a
man that wants to be remembered?

43:11.622 --> 43:13.067
What's that?

43:13.124 --> 43:15.866
In a year or two, his own
son won't know who he is.
