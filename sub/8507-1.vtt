00:59.286 --> 01:00.986
- Morning, Angie!
- Hi, Angie.

01:00.988 --> 01:02.821
- Nice to see you again.
- Have a nice day.

01:02.823 --> 01:05.223
Looking good, Angie!

01:05.224 --> 01:07.592
You go get 'em, Angie Tribeca.

01:19.430 --> 01:21.597
- What do we got?
- Oh, it's a nasty one.

01:21.599 --> 01:24.433
Old lady, appears to be in
her late 90s, early 100s.

01:24.434 --> 01:26.467
Found her lying here next
to this bag of groceries.

01:26.469 --> 01:28.202
What happened?

01:28.204 --> 01:29.537
Well, she was either shot to death

01:29.539 --> 01:31.005
or smothered with a pillow.

01:31.007 --> 01:32.940
I won't know for sure till
I take her back to the lab

01:32.942 --> 01:34.075
and cut her open.

01:34.077 --> 01:35.746
Hello.

01:35.746 --> 01:38.446
Could someone please help me up?

01:41.151 --> 01:42.283
Is that man all right?

01:42.285 --> 01:45.320
Get it out, rookie.
You'll get used to it...

01:45.322 --> 01:47.255
Unfortunately.

02:04.354 --> 02:05.453
Tanner, Hoffman.

02:05.455 --> 02:06.787
Tribeca.

02:06.789 --> 02:08.255
Lieutenant wants to see you.

02:08.257 --> 02:09.723
What's this about?

02:09.726 --> 02:12.159
I don't know, but he doesn't look happy.

02:12.161 --> 02:13.494
He never looks happy.

02:13.496 --> 02:14.862
You've got that right.

02:19.137 --> 02:20.700
You wanted to see me, Lieutenant?

02:20.739 --> 02:22.639
Tribeca, I'd like you
to meet your new partner.

02:22.785 --> 02:24.129
This is Jay Geils.

02:25.982 --> 02:28.141
With all due respect, sir, this is stupid.

02:28.354 --> 02:30.321
I don't want a partner.
I don't need a partner.

02:30.324 --> 02:31.656
All due respect, Tribeca,

02:31.658 --> 02:33.191
but you've got your head up your ass.

02:33.193 --> 02:34.125
You're getting a partner.

02:34.127 --> 02:35.160
All due respect, Lieutenant,

02:35.162 --> 02:36.494
but I feel very disrespected right now.

02:36.496 --> 02:40.165
All due respect, Detective,
but I'm in charge here!

02:40.167 --> 02:41.684
All due respect, no one
cares about your feelings.

02:41.661 --> 02:43.794
All due respect, you make
a horrible first impression.

02:43.819 --> 02:46.487
All due respect, I will never
hear what you have to say

02:46.489 --> 02:48.088
- 'cause it's dumb.
- Hey, hey, hey!

02:48.089 --> 02:50.356
You two are partners, so
you better get used to it!

02:50.358 --> 02:51.691
Tribeca, Geils.

02:51.693 --> 02:52.658
Geils, Tribeca.

02:52.660 --> 02:54.469
-  Pleasure to meet you.
- Yeah, right.

02:54.469 --> 02:56.815
Lieutenant, you know that
partners never work for me.

02:56.933 --> 02:59.567
Well, maybe partner 237 is the charm.

02:59.569 --> 03:02.003
I've got a case for you two.
The Mayor's being blackmailed.

03:02.005 --> 03:03.671
Get down to city hall.

03:03.673 --> 03:05.339
He's expecting you yesterday!

03:05.341 --> 03:06.707
Go!

03:06.709 --> 03:07.976
Could I carry a folder, too?

03:08.736 --> 03:09.711
Thanks.

03:10.705 --> 03:12.605
I'm tough, but I'm fair.

03:13.715 --> 03:15.338
There's something you should know about me.

03:15.338 --> 03:16.938
I don't like partners,

03:16.963 --> 03:18.863
and I especially don't like partners

03:18.866 --> 03:20.336
who try to get personal, okay?

03:20.548 --> 03:23.816
So I don't want to hear about
your sad, messed-up childhood,

03:23.817 --> 03:26.284
I don't care about your
history of depression,

03:26.286 --> 03:27.552
and I definitely don't want to know

03:27.554 --> 03:28.636
any of your pets' names, got it?

03:28.636 --> 03:29.079
Got it.

03:32.018 --> 03:34.184
As if that weren't bad enough,

03:34.186 --> 03:35.653
they forgot to tell me

03:35.655 --> 03:37.655
that the antibiotics gives
you a yeast infection.

03:37.657 --> 03:38.923
That was pleasant.

03:38.925 --> 03:41.659
For the record, I just asked
you to roll the window down.

03:49.519 --> 03:50.852
We're here to see the Mayor.

03:50.854 --> 03:52.587
What was the name of your childhood pet?

03:52.587 --> 03:53.619
Mr. Cat.

03:53.620 --> 03:54.653
Eleanor Roosevelt.

03:54.655 --> 03:55.787
Boxers or briefs?

03:55.789 --> 03:57.689
Boxer briefs.

03:57.691 --> 04:00.191
The Mayor will see you now.

04:02.950 --> 04:04.150
Someone has photos.

04:04.152 --> 04:05.351
What kind of photos?

04:05.328 --> 04:06.674
Compromising photos.

04:06.699 --> 04:07.864
Did you hump a dolphin?

04:07.866 --> 04:08.866
No.

04:08.867 --> 04:10.701
No.

04:10.703 --> 04:11.828
No, I...

04:12.319 --> 04:13.552
No.

04:13.531 --> 04:16.098
No, look.

04:19.202 --> 04:20.836
I was young and stupid.

04:20.838 --> 04:23.305
Someone took photos and
threatened to ruin my career

04:23.307 --> 04:25.374
if I don't pay them $4,000.

04:25.376 --> 04:26.408
I don't have that kind of money.

04:26.410 --> 04:27.810
Who could have taken these photos?

04:27.812 --> 04:31.135
The only one I can think of
is my wife and my mistress.

04:31.135 --> 04:33.202
They're the only ones that
have seen me with my shirt off.

04:33.204 --> 04:34.904
- That's it?
- And every Wednesday,

04:34.906 --> 04:37.673
I pose nude for a drawing
class at Verdugo Valley College.

04:37.675 --> 04:39.742
Let's start with the wife.

04:40.688 --> 04:42.755
After that, he said, "Are you serious?"

04:42.757 --> 04:44.557
No one gets syphilis anymore."

04:45.226 --> 04:48.127
For the record, I just asked
if you'd ever been to Edmonton.

04:51.015 --> 04:52.214
May I help you?

04:52.216 --> 04:53.615
Is Mrs. Perry home?

04:53.617 --> 04:56.051
May I ask you to state your business?

04:56.053 --> 04:58.921
Listen, chump, I've had just
about enough of your lip.

04:59.374 --> 05:02.109
Well, that was completely unexpected.

05:03.245 --> 05:05.712
Okay. I've had enough.

05:07.893 --> 05:08.809
Titty twister.

05:08.809 --> 05:09.841
Ooh!

05:09.843 --> 05:12.244
Aah!

05:13.313 --> 05:14.579
Mrs. Perry.

05:14.581 --> 05:16.414
- Yes.
- Tribeca. L.A.P.D.

05:16.416 --> 05:18.316
Can I have a moment of your time?

05:18.318 --> 05:20.252
Please, come in.

05:24.574 --> 05:27.308
My husband is a complicated man, Detective.

05:27.309 --> 05:29.810
Those tattoos are a part of who he was,

05:29.812 --> 05:31.812
not who he is now.

05:31.814 --> 05:34.348
Oh. Excuse my rudeness.

05:34.350 --> 05:35.549
Would you like some tea?

05:35.551 --> 05:37.161
No, thank you. I'm fine, ma'am.

05:37.161 --> 05:38.494
Cream-filled doughnut?

05:38.497 --> 05:39.996
No, thank you.

05:39.998 --> 05:41.898
Baby-back ribs?

05:41.900 --> 05:43.366
They're from a pig.

05:43.368 --> 05:45.235
Just a touch early in the morning for me,

05:45.237 --> 05:47.819
thank you, ma'am. Okay.

05:47.818 --> 05:49.253
Are you sure?

05:49.253 --> 05:50.386
Pretty sure.

05:50.388 --> 05:52.221
- They're here if you need them.
- Thank you.

05:52.223 --> 05:55.124
Who would try to extort
money from my husband?

05:55.126 --> 05:57.560
Oh, I don't know. What about you?

05:57.562 --> 06:00.195
Don't be silly.

06:00.197 --> 06:02.349
I have access to all of
my husband's accounts.

06:02.441 --> 06:03.690
Why would I want to blackmail him?

06:04.543 --> 06:06.643
Do you love your husband, Mrs. Perry?

06:06.645 --> 06:08.512
I most certainly do not.

06:08.514 --> 06:11.220
How dare you accuse me
of loving my husband.

06:12.101 --> 06:13.133
Gyro?

06:13.135 --> 06:14.501
Ooh!

06:18.859 --> 06:20.281
Here's what I don't understand.

06:20.281 --> 06:21.446
What's that?

06:21.448 --> 06:23.315
If you can't stand your husband,

06:23.317 --> 06:24.917
why stay married to him?

06:24.919 --> 06:27.452
We have an arrangement, Detective.

06:27.454 --> 06:28.876
He has his playthings.

06:28.876 --> 06:30.309
I have mine.

06:30.311 --> 06:34.046
So you get luge, he has his mistress.

06:34.048 --> 06:36.248
Oh, no, no, no.

06:36.250 --> 06:39.218
I have my playthings.

06:40.171 --> 06:42.838
He's got a mistress? Are you shitting me?!

06:42.840 --> 06:44.640
I shit you not, ma'am.

06:47.660 --> 06:49.527
Well, that went nowhere fast.

06:49.529 --> 06:51.863
Let's see what we can
get out of the mistress.

06:56.770 --> 06:58.804
Oh, I know the Mayor. Oh, yes.

06:59.050 --> 07:00.349
Intimately.

07:00.351 --> 07:01.851
When's the last time you saw him?

07:03.654 --> 07:04.310
Who?

07:04.310 --> 07:05.310
The Mayor.

07:05.311 --> 07:07.411
Never heard of him.

07:08.114 --> 07:10.148
Someone's trying to take advantage

07:10.150 --> 07:12.250
of his physical attributes.

07:12.252 --> 07:15.781
Oh, I took advantage of his
physical attributes many times,

07:15.904 --> 07:17.114
if you know what I mean.

07:17.438 --> 07:19.672
Apparently, there are
photos of his body art,

07:19.674 --> 07:21.641
photos that could destroy him.

07:21.643 --> 07:23.309
Oh, I've already destroyed him...

07:23.311 --> 07:26.746
With having sex with him,
if you catch my drift.

07:26.748 --> 07:29.232
I did it with him. He did it with me.

07:29.232 --> 07:33.234
If you understand my meanin'.

07:34.337 --> 07:36.805
You think it's smoke, but it's vapor.

07:36.807 --> 07:40.408
We're looking into everyone
who had the opportunity

07:40.410 --> 07:41.243
to see his tattoos.

07:41.243 --> 07:43.229
Oh, I saw his tattoos, all right...

07:43.385 --> 07:44.417
And his pee pee...

07:44.419 --> 07:46.319
If you know where I'm coming from.

07:46.322 --> 07:50.358
His bathing-suit area
without the bathing suit.

07:50.360 --> 07:52.793
- I think you're lying.
- I think <i> you're</i> lying.

07:52.832 --> 07:54.432
- You're a liar.
- No, I'm not.

07:54.433 --> 07:55.889
You never had an affair with the Mayor.

07:55.889 --> 07:56.889
Yes, I did.

07:56.890 --> 08:00.291
It was sordid and raunchy and wet.

08:00.955 --> 08:04.190
That device makes you seem
like a health-conscious person.

08:05.456 --> 08:07.456
Describe his lower-back tattoo.

08:07.458 --> 08:09.314
What do you call it? A shamrock.

08:09.314 --> 08:12.249
No, uh, it's a butterfly with Ivy.

08:12.251 --> 08:14.117
- Wrong!
- It's a little unicorn...

08:14.119 --> 08:15.452
- No... 
- With a rainbow...

08:15.454 --> 08:16.486
- No.
- No, it's not that.

08:16.488 --> 08:17.888
No, no, I know it's not.

08:17.890 --> 08:19.856
It's a... It's a puppy dog.

08:19.858 --> 08:20.625
Want to try again?

08:20.625 --> 08:22.024
- It's a diamond.
- Nope.

08:22.026 --> 08:23.225
- It's a flame.
- Nope.

08:23.227 --> 08:23.936
It's an eyetooth.

08:23.936 --> 08:25.503
- Was there an eyetooth?
- I don't know.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.071
- It's a Buddha.
- No. No.

08:27.073 --> 08:28.205
It's a four-leaf clover.

08:28.207 --> 08:29.440
Wrong! They're all wrong!

08:29.442 --> 08:31.108
- It's a matchbox car.
- You're wrong.

08:31.110 --> 08:33.410
It's a picture of a sheep with the words...

08:33.413 --> 08:34.945
"That's what sheep said."

08:34.947 --> 08:38.149
Fine. Fine. He's not my lover.

08:38.150 --> 08:39.768
I think we're done here.

08:39.768 --> 08:42.068
But we did make out once in high school.

08:42.071 --> 08:44.468
Thank you for your time, Ms. Vivarquar.

08:44.468 --> 08:45.934
I'm gonna get one of those for my nephew.

08:45.936 --> 08:47.702
He's 8. He'll love it.

08:47.704 --> 08:49.537
He went to second base!

08:49.539 --> 08:51.473
With me!

08:51.475 --> 08:53.908
I don't get it.

08:53.909 --> 08:56.176
Why would she lie about having
an affair with the Mayor?

08:56.179 --> 08:57.278
Well, it's simple, really.

08:57.279 --> 08:58.912
The Mayor is a man with something to hide.

08:58.915 --> 08:59.971
Right, his weird tattoos.

09:00.061 --> 09:01.661
Right, so he needs something else,

09:01.662 --> 09:02.961
something to throw people off.

09:02.963 --> 09:05.764
- A second secret.
- Exactly.

09:05.766 --> 09:07.566
So he asks his high-school girlfriend

09:07.568 --> 09:09.467
to pose as his mistress.

09:09.469 --> 09:11.570
To create a diversion.

09:11.572 --> 09:14.005
A smoke screen.

09:14.007 --> 09:16.775
Which keeps the real secret...

09:38.333 --> 09:39.699
I...

09:41.958 --> 09:43.457
Think we should go.

09:56.748 --> 09:58.915
Let me help you with that.

09:59.084 --> 10:00.084
Interesting.

10:00.085 --> 10:02.179
- What?
- Well, this blackmail note.

10:02.156 --> 10:04.170
When I place it under the magnifying glass,

10:04.170 --> 10:05.703
the print becomes much larger,

10:05.704 --> 10:07.270
but then when I take it away,

10:07.272 --> 10:08.905
it's immediately small again.

10:08.908 --> 10:10.374
Hmm.

10:10.376 --> 10:13.311
Good night, Margaret.

10:14.057 --> 10:15.193
Ah. Dr. Edelweiss.

10:15.193 --> 10:17.260
Scholls. Tribeca.

10:17.262 --> 10:18.262
Doctor.

10:18.263 --> 10:18.993
And?

10:18.993 --> 10:20.760
Jay Geils. I'm new.

10:21.762 --> 10:24.763
As you can see, I can't
exactly shake your hand.

10:24.765 --> 10:26.331
Of course. I'm so sorry.

10:26.333 --> 10:29.167
Oh, don't be sorry. You didn't do it.

10:29.169 --> 10:30.602
Or did you?

10:30.604 --> 10:33.271
Doctor, this is the blackmail
note I was talking to you about.

10:33.273 --> 10:34.940
- Any prints?
- No, I wiped them all off.

10:34.942 --> 10:37.876
Let's take a closer look, shall we?

10:38.646 --> 10:39.912
Thank you, Scholls.

10:39.913 --> 10:41.380
Mm-hmm.

11:31.512 --> 11:33.879
Magnify.

11:34.953 --> 11:36.553
Enlarge.

11:37.918 --> 11:40.185
Make look big.

11:40.187 --> 11:41.397
Hmm.

11:41.515 --> 11:42.747
Interesting.

11:42.762 --> 11:44.262
- What is it?
- The letters.

11:44.398 --> 11:46.632
Now, if you look at the
T's, the way they're crossed,

11:46.811 --> 11:48.111
in that harsh, haphazard manner,

11:48.411 --> 11:49.911
this indicates someone who's desperate.

11:49.957 --> 11:51.623
And the b's and the d's, they tell me

11:51.625 --> 11:55.294
that this is someone who is
in rather dire financial need.

11:55.296 --> 11:55.890
Wow.

11:55.890 --> 11:57.923
Yes, and look at the
spaces between the words,

11:57.925 --> 12:00.592
those small, ungenerous spaces.

12:00.594 --> 12:02.327
They're telling me that this person

12:02.329 --> 12:04.263
has no respect for authority.

12:04.265 --> 12:05.497
So let me get this clear.

12:05.499 --> 12:06.832
What you're saying is that

12:06.834 --> 12:10.002
this is a note written by an individual

12:10.004 --> 12:14.440
who is desperate enough to
blackmail the Mayor for money.

12:15.919 --> 12:17.184
Well, that's a bit of a simplification,

12:17.186 --> 12:18.819
but, yes, I suppose so.

12:27.196 --> 12:28.329
Unh!

12:31.334 --> 12:33.267
- It's not the wife.
- How do you know?

12:33.269 --> 12:36.036
Oh! Because she has
nothing to gain. She's set.

12:36.038 --> 12:37.438
Well, what about the mistress?

12:37.440 --> 12:39.607
She's not even the mistress.

12:39.609 --> 12:43.110
Who took those pictures?!

12:43.112 --> 12:46.013
I don't know.

12:46.015 --> 12:48.115
I feel like we're missing something.

12:48.117 --> 12:49.250
Just doesn't add up.

12:49.252 --> 12:51.452
Shld uh go tru da kowa?

12:51.454 --> 12:52.488
You know what, Geils?

12:52.488 --> 12:54.188
You may be on to something.

13:00.802 --> 13:05.833
Recognize the arch of the back
and the framework of the body.

13:05.835 --> 13:07.468
Professor Lamereau,

13:07.470 --> 13:10.071
two detectives from the police
department are here to see you.

13:10.073 --> 13:11.806
How can I help you two detectives?

13:11.808 --> 13:13.879
Professor, we are in the
process of investigating...

13:13.879 --> 13:17.414
I keep telling you people, it
was a scuba-gear malfunction.

13:17.416 --> 13:18.416
I loved her.

13:18.417 --> 13:19.983
An extortion plot.

13:19.985 --> 13:21.685
Oh.

13:21.687 --> 13:23.581
I understand why you
think that I might have

13:23.581 --> 13:25.081
something to do with all of this,

13:25.083 --> 13:27.784
but rest assured, our
figure models are treated

13:27.786 --> 13:30.286
with the utmost dignity and respect.

13:30.288 --> 13:33.790
The human body is a
miraculous canvas, Detective.

13:34.726 --> 13:37.960
It's a shame that you don't
put your natural attributes

13:37.962 --> 13:39.493
to better use for the sake of art.

13:39.493 --> 13:42.215
I don't prance around nude for money.

13:42.215 --> 13:43.314
Not anymore.

13:43.316 --> 13:45.683
Pity. Such a waste.

13:45.685 --> 13:47.118
- Hey!
- Yes?

13:47.120 --> 13:48.252
I know what you're implying.

13:48.254 --> 13:51.255
If you'll excuse me, I
have to get back to class.

13:51.257 --> 13:54.158
Don't plan on taking any
out-of-state trips in the near future.

13:54.160 --> 13:56.108
I have to be in Phoenix
for a wedding on the 14th.

13:56.108 --> 13:56.889
Not happening.

13:56.891 --> 13:59.036
Then, on the 24th, it's
my grandmother's birthday.

13:59.036 --> 13:59.828
No way.

13:59.829 --> 14:01.829
I have tickets to the Harlem
Globetrotters in October.

14:01.831 --> 14:04.032
Those tickets are really hard to get.

14:04.034 --> 14:06.100
Fine, Lamereau, you can go.

14:06.102 --> 14:07.936
But don't go and do anything stupid.

14:07.915 --> 14:10.268
I wouldn't think of it.

14:10.268 --> 14:11.935
We'll be in touch.

14:15.156 --> 14:16.456
I think he's hiding something.

14:16.458 --> 14:17.323
Absolutely.

14:17.325 --> 14:18.591
Got to get closer to him.

14:18.593 --> 14:20.293
But how? How do we get closer to him?

14:20.295 --> 14:22.495
Excuse me. Do you know
where the art school is?

14:22.497 --> 14:24.243
I'm late for figure drawing class.

14:24.243 --> 14:25.776
I'm a nude model.

14:25.778 --> 14:29.113
I think I just got an idea.

14:32.185 --> 14:33.684
What is it?

14:39.306 --> 14:40.772
You're late.

14:50.686 --> 14:51.819
Tribeca, can you hear me?

14:51.821 --> 14:53.521
- I'm in position.
- Good.

14:53.523 --> 14:55.656
Hey, where did you put your wire, anyway?

14:55.658 --> 14:57.825
That's not important.

14:57.827 --> 14:59.326
Let's just say we should probably

14:59.328 --> 15:00.394
throw it out when we're done.

15:00.396 --> 15:01.929
So it's in your bum.

15:02.513 --> 15:04.760
All right, keep your eye
out for anything suspicious.

15:04.853 --> 15:05.952
Copy.

15:06.033 --> 15:07.599
Nice.

15:09.249 --> 15:10.948
Yes.

15:10.950 --> 15:12.984
Good.

15:12.986 --> 15:14.852
Good!

15:14.854 --> 15:18.556
Remember that the human body is a temple.

15:18.558 --> 15:21.087
It's a form to be honored and celebrated.

15:21.087 --> 15:24.323
Look upon today's Venus. She is glorious.

15:24.402 --> 15:28.671
She is as she was created,
her skin smooth and unadorned.

15:28.673 --> 15:32.141
She is not altered or pierced...

15:32.143 --> 15:33.988
Or tattooed.

15:33.988 --> 15:35.521
Hold on. What did he say?

15:35.523 --> 15:38.024
Disgusting, dirty tattoos.

15:38.026 --> 15:41.728
Ink, electronically embedded
in the skin... so gross.

15:41.730 --> 15:43.129
I just hate them so much.

15:43.131 --> 15:46.399
I would go to great lengths to
embarrass those with tattoos,

15:46.378 --> 15:49.465
especially mildly offensive
tattoos or bad-joke tattoos.

15:49.465 --> 15:51.765
You know, like something printed
on a mug at Spencer's Gifts.

15:51.768 --> 15:54.436
Kind of funny in the store, but later on,

15:54.438 --> 15:56.637
it's something your friends
think is really lame.

15:56.637 --> 15:58.570
Tribeca, we got him. Go in for the kill.

15:58.572 --> 16:00.038
Tell me, professor,

16:00.040 --> 16:03.408
would you ever blackmail
someone with tattoos?

16:03.410 --> 16:05.010
Well, if he were in a position of power

16:05.012 --> 16:08.580
and I could stand to make
a cool $4,000, you bet.

16:08.582 --> 16:12.184
Well, it looks like
the Harlem Globetrotters

16:12.186 --> 16:14.619
are gonna have to find
someone else in their audience

16:14.621 --> 16:17.722
to throw confetti on instead of water.

16:17.724 --> 16:20.392
Your blackmailing days are over.

16:20.394 --> 16:22.328
You won't get very far without this.

16:22.328 --> 16:23.394
You'll never take me alive!

16:23.396 --> 16:24.528
He's coming your direction!

16:24.530 --> 16:25.896
I got him.

16:28.067 --> 16:29.900
Uh...

17:55.881 --> 17:57.147
Unh!

17:57.460 --> 17:59.997
You're under arrest for
suspicion of extortion.

17:59.997 --> 18:01.797
His aesthetic was offensive to me.

18:01.800 --> 18:02.999
I wanted to embarrass him.

18:03.001 --> 18:05.135
Well, then why didn't you
just bully him on Facebook

18:05.137 --> 18:07.304
or instagram like any decent human being?

18:07.306 --> 18:09.539
Well, I was going to do
that, after I got the money.

18:09.541 --> 18:10.674
Well, where you're going,

18:10.676 --> 18:12.267
you won't have to worry about that anymore.

18:12.267 --> 18:15.902
Your own little slice of hell
called minimum-security prison.

18:15.904 --> 18:17.904
Get ready, 'cause for
the next seven months,

18:17.906 --> 18:19.998
you'll be making ponchos
and playing mahjong.

18:19.998 --> 18:22.365
It's a complicated Chinese dominos game.

18:22.367 --> 18:23.900
Good luck figuring that one out.

18:23.902 --> 18:26.202
Aah!

18:27.151 --> 18:29.685
Easy! Easy. Ow.

18:30.125 --> 18:31.424
You know what, Tribeca?

18:31.426 --> 18:35.428
You're nothing but a... Dumb jerk.

18:35.430 --> 18:37.430
Sticks and stones...

18:37.432 --> 18:40.000
And puppy-dog tails.

18:43.772 --> 18:45.110
Interesting first day.

18:45.110 --> 18:46.588
Yeah.

18:47.589 --> 18:49.222
Sorry about earlier.

18:49.224 --> 18:50.323
I just...

18:50.325 --> 18:52.459
I haven't had much luck with partners.

18:52.461 --> 18:55.061
Hey, I get it.

18:56.765 --> 18:58.465
Listen, if you're not doing anything,

18:58.467 --> 19:01.504
I... I thought maybe we could
grab a beer or something.

19:01.973 --> 19:03.506
I mean, you do drink beer, don't you?

19:03.509 --> 19:05.943
I don't drink beer. I rent it.

19:19.164 --> 19:21.598
Yeah, okay. Sure.

19:25.237 --> 19:28.705
So, does this mean we're, uh, partners now?

19:28.707 --> 19:30.477
Yeah. Why not?

19:30.477 --> 19:32.277
Partners.

19:32.279 --> 19:34.012
Yo! Tribeca!

19:35.149 --> 19:37.616
Lieutenant wants to see you. Okay.

19:39.620 --> 19:41.119
Cut that with a knife.

19:43.123 --> 19:44.256
Rain check.

19:44.258 --> 19:45.591
Yeah.

19:47.995 --> 19:50.596
You okay with this partner thing?

19:50.818 --> 19:52.771
Yeah, I think I am.

19:52.771 --> 19:55.972
I, uh... I actually have a
pretty good feeling about it.

19:55.974 --> 19:58.308
Cool.

19:58.310 --> 19:59.509
Me too.

19:59.511 --> 20:00.677
I'll see you later.

20:00.679 --> 20:03.179
Okay, cool.

20:06.184 --> 20:07.616
Aah!

20:11.085 --> 20:14.720
Oh, crap! Somebody call 911!
