WEBVTT

00:00.417 --> 00:01.937
Nathaniel Bazile.

00:03.600 --> 00:04.203
Yeh! That's me.

00:04.402 --> 00:05.452
I'm your daughter.

00:05.519 --> 00:07.620
You and someone had a kid.

00:07.705 --> 00:10.573
You gave up that
kid I am that kid.

00:10.624 --> 00:11.925
And now I'm applying
for emancipation.

00:11.992 --> 00:13.910
Cate Cassidy, that's your mom.

00:13.961 --> 00:15.495
Cate Cassidy was
pregnant in high school?

00:15.579 --> 00:16.262
Yes.

00:16.329 --> 00:17.547
I am Cate Cassidy.

00:17.615 --> 00:19.599
Ryan and I have
been up since 5:00.

00:19.667 --> 00:22.152
And as usual, arguing since 6:00.

00:22.219 --> 00:24.137
What are you doing?
Will you marry me?

00:24.221 --> 00:26.806
I see you turn 16 tomorrow.

00:26.891 --> 00:27.492
What are you doing here?

00:28.016 --> 00:29.918
Uh, they're, um, my birth parents.

00:30.329 --> 00:32.259
I am not granting
you emancipation.

00:32.662 --> 00:36.454
I'm releasing you back into
their temporary joint custody.

00:36.767 --> 00:39.135
You never even told me I've got
a kid out there! Why would I?!

00:39.186 --> 00:41.104
You wouldn't even admit
that she existed.

00:41.172 --> 00:43.907
What if there is a part of me
that is in love with you, too?

00:43.974 --> 00:45.624
I'm not in love with you.

00:46.401 --> 00:49.746
Baze is never gonna be the
guy that you want him to be.

00:49.814 --> 00:53.149
And what you have
with Ryan is real.

00:53.190 --> 00:54.767
And now by the
powers vested in me,

00:55.731 --> 00:58.225
I pronounce you husband and wife.

01:15.318 --> 01:15.834
Great news, folks.

01:16.106 --> 01:19.132
We'll be touching down 20
minutes ahead of schedule.

01:19.484 --> 01:20.391
Take it in! Take it in!

01:22.141 --> 01:22.652
Come on. Take it out.

01:22.990 --> 01:24.010
Flight attendants,
prepare for landing.

01:24.989 --> 01:27.655
And for those of you who are
from Portland, welcome home.

01:33.743 --> 01:38.413
Nate... Nate... You okay?

01:41.934 --> 01:43.568
We're home!

01:43.636 --> 01:45.053
The slot, the slot machine.

01:45.121 --> 01:46.421
Thank you, sir.

01:46.489 --> 01:47.856
Home! Thank you.

01:47.923 --> 01:51.142
Not big winners. A lot of cheese.

01:51.210 --> 01:53.244
Hi, we made it home!

01:53.295 --> 01:57.682
Pick her up or something,
like... Mr. and Mrs. Cassidy!

01:57.750 --> 01:59.534
Hello, hello.

01:59.602 --> 02:01.553
Love you!

02:04.640 --> 02:05.757
Nice shot.

02:05.825 --> 02:07.108
So what is this, a pity game, huh?

02:07.176 --> 02:09.377
No, I just... I'm, uh...

02:09.445 --> 02:12.230
They get back today
from their honeymoon.

02:12.281 --> 02:14.049
Have you talked to her?
To Cate? No.

02:14.116 --> 02:16.284
No.

02:16.369 --> 02:19.937
And radio silence from Lux, too,
which I don't... you know?

02:19.989 --> 02:21.606
I mean, how sad is it that

02:21.657 --> 02:23.575
I can't even interrupt
a wedding right?

02:23.626 --> 02:25.943
I mean, who bursts in
after the "I do's"?

02:25.995 --> 02:26.944
Yeah.

02:26.996 --> 02:30.231
I just... I want to
talk to her... to Cate.

02:30.299 --> 02:32.584
What could you say that
would make any difference?

02:32.635 --> 02:37.138
I don't know. I don't know.

02:37.206 --> 02:38.339
All right!

02:38.424 --> 02:39.841
Take it up! Take it up!

02:39.925 --> 02:43.978
Okay, what are the odds that
no two gifts here are the same?

02:44.063 --> 02:46.598
Whatever we need the least,
I'm sure we'll get two of.

02:46.649 --> 02:49.567
Bread machines, margaritavilles.

02:49.635 --> 02:51.469
Well, everyone knows that you
need two margaritavilles.

02:54.407 --> 02:56.107
Bye! I'll see you later.

02:56.158 --> 02:58.443
Wait a second. Where are you going?
We just got home.

02:58.511 --> 03:00.862
We're about to make
margaritas... and bread.

03:02.198 --> 03:03.415
Well, I'm going to Bug's.

03:03.482 --> 03:05.149
He loves free stuff,
so I got him matchbooks

03:05.201 --> 03:06.684
from every hotel we
went to in Vegas.

03:06.752 --> 03:09.838
That way, he has souvenirs
from New York and Paris,

03:09.905 --> 03:13.324
Venice, the Sahara...
Yeah. Very cute.

03:13.375 --> 03:15.293
And a lot less tacky than that
"loose slots" shirt

03:15.344 --> 03:16.594
you bought for your mom.

03:16.662 --> 03:18.463
I'm telling you,
she's gonna wear it.

03:18.514 --> 03:19.981
All right, I'll call you later.

03:21.567 --> 03:27.405
Oh, and guys... Thank you.

03:36.132 --> 03:37.315
How did this happen?

03:37.383 --> 03:38.399
What?

03:38.467 --> 03:40.919
That I got everything
I ever wanted.

03:40.986 --> 03:42.403
I promise that at some point

03:42.471 --> 03:44.923
we are gonna have a
real honeymoon, just us.

03:47.426 --> 03:51.429
Uh, you know, it's just
the two of us right now...

03:59.388 --> 04:01.222
Hi. Hey.

04:13.245 --> 04:15.003
No, I am not gonna get that.

04:15.552 --> 04:16.113
Good.

04:17.156 --> 04:19.028
I mean, unless you think I
should check the caller I.D.

04:19.159 --> 04:19.692
I don't.

04:21.543 --> 04:23.228
Come on!

04:25.247 --> 04:26.197
Oh!

04:26.248 --> 04:27.027
Oh, what?

04:28.176 --> 04:30.144
I didn't want to interrupt
your honeymoon with business,

04:30.228 --> 04:32.179
so I waited as long as I could.

04:32.263 --> 04:34.014
For what? Um, where's Alice?

04:34.099 --> 04:35.666
She took a leave.
Her mother relapsed.

04:35.733 --> 04:36.683
Oh, my God!

04:36.768 --> 04:38.452
And in her absence,

04:38.520 --> 04:41.088
we've decided to make a
rather significant change.

04:41.156 --> 04:43.526
Cate, Ryan, meet Kelly Campbell.

04:46.494 --> 04:48.445
Such a pleasure to meet you.

04:48.496 --> 04:50.147
You're Alice's replacement?

04:50.198 --> 04:54.084
Actually... She's
your new co-host.

04:59.357 --> 05:01.558
There aren't any
clocks or windows,

05:01.626 --> 05:04.378
and they keep everything
bright and pump oxygen in

05:04.462 --> 05:06.396
to make people stay up late.

05:06.464 --> 05:08.348
Oh! We stayed in the
penthouse suite,

05:08.433 --> 05:12.319
and there were bridges and rivers
and-and boats inside the hotel.

05:12.387 --> 05:16.006
And everything smelled like
baby powder and cigarettes...

05:16.057 --> 05:18.025
In a good way.

05:18.092 --> 05:19.409
Sounds like fun.

05:19.477 --> 05:20.811
Yeah, it was.

05:20.879 --> 05:23.697
For the first time,
I just felt like this normal kid

05:23.765 --> 05:28.135
with her normal parents on
this normal family vacation.

05:29.320 --> 05:36.994
Hmm... You know, maybe we
can go sometime to Vegas.

05:37.045 --> 05:39.012
Maybe we can have
our honeymoon there.

05:40.364 --> 05:41.849
I got you something, too.

05:47.839 --> 05:49.756
You getting adopted,
the wedding...

05:49.824 --> 05:51.341
It's like everything's changing.

05:51.392 --> 05:54.478
And that's great,
but I-I just want you to know

05:54.546 --> 05:58.682
not everything has to...
That I'm not going anywhere.

06:04.889 --> 06:09.109
Bug... What is this?

06:09.194 --> 06:11.762
Will you marry me?

06:35.518 --> 06:37.619
The diamond's real.

06:37.687 --> 06:39.771
They tried to sell
me some cubic crap.

06:39.856 --> 06:42.341
Here, take it.

06:42.408 --> 06:44.409
Here, take it!

06:44.494 --> 06:46.662
I've been picking up
extra shifts at the bar,

06:46.729 --> 06:50.248
and they have this payment plan thing,
so... I... Bug, this is...

06:50.333 --> 06:53.035
I don't even know what to say.

06:53.102 --> 06:56.188
I know, I know we're young,
and we can wait

06:56.255 --> 06:57.773
until you're done
with high school,

06:57.840 --> 06:59.975
but it just means nothing
can mess us up...

07:01.878 --> 07:03.862
...That we know we want
to be together forever.

07:07.767 --> 07:08.934
Yeah.

07:09.018 --> 07:10.836
Yeah, I mean, I mean, yes.
Yes, of course.

07:10.903 --> 07:12.338
Yes!

07:20.207 --> 07:21.491
I know this is awkward,

07:21.558 --> 07:23.743
and I don't want to blame
Alice since she's not here

07:23.811 --> 07:25.545
to defend herself,
but a lot of what

07:25.629 --> 07:27.797
went wrong was
completely her fault.

07:27.848 --> 07:30.066
We want to revamp the show.

07:30.134 --> 07:32.018
The audience we have,
they're not going anywhere.

07:32.102 --> 07:34.376
We need to reach out to the
audience we don't have.

07:35.049 --> 07:36.563
Okay, what does that even mean?
It's a nice way of saying

07:36.792 --> 07:39.093
they think the show sucks and
they want more people to listen.

07:39.144 --> 07:40.961
Exactly. We don't want a
show about boring people.

07:42.024 --> 07:43.575
And marriage is boring.

07:44.372 --> 07:45.846
Kelly offers a new perspective.

07:46.506 --> 07:48.067
She's just written her third book.

07:48.287 --> 07:50.528
She can sex up the show while
solving your marriage problems.

07:50.709 --> 07:52.160
What problems? We've been
married less than two weeks.

07:52.228 --> 07:54.112
You can't be a marriage
expert and not be married.

07:54.180 --> 07:57.682
That is like being a sex expert
and still being a virgin!

07:58.851 --> 07:59.435
I am.

08:01.163 --> 08:01.738
A sex expert?

08:02.368 --> 08:02.963
A virgin.

08:04.068 --> 08:05.274
I'm saving myself for marriage...

08:05.960 --> 08:06.845
Like Jessica Simpson.

08:07.407 --> 08:08.261
And Jesus.

08:10.327 --> 08:11.973
Technically,
I'm a born-again virgin.

08:13.130 --> 08:15.675
Jane Goodall didn't have 
to be a chimp to write about them.

08:16.610 --> 08:17.866
Which reminds me.

08:18.654 --> 08:21.673
My new book... About the
plight of the married woman.

08:21.740 --> 08:23.424
Oh, you can't have it all?

08:23.509 --> 08:25.794
Never heard of it.

08:25.878 --> 08:27.328
You know who has heard of it?

08:27.396 --> 08:28.463
Oprah, Ellen.

08:28.547 --> 08:29.597
Sandra Bullock.

08:29.682 --> 08:31.182
She may option the movie rights.

08:31.250 --> 08:32.383
Fingers crossed.

08:32.433 --> 08:35.537
Okay, I am sorry.
This is a two-person show.

08:35.604 --> 08:37.772
We cannot have three co-hosts.

08:39.113 --> 08:40.148
"Co" means "two."

08:43.515 --> 08:44.140
Doesn't it?

08:45.231 --> 08:46.931
Actually, it means "with."

08:46.982 --> 08:49.100
"Co" means "with."

08:52.176 --> 08:53.776
Come on. It could be worse.

08:53.844 --> 08:57.763
Our show's being taken
over by a fake, smug virgin

08:57.815 --> 09:00.517
whose job it is to pick
apart our marriage on-air.

09:00.584 --> 09:02.685
I mean, how can it
be worse than that?

09:04.321 --> 09:06.772
If we've proven anything to
ourselves these last few months...

09:06.824 --> 09:09.509
Hey, guys!

09:09.577 --> 09:11.711
...It's that we can
handle third wheels.

09:11.778 --> 09:15.415
So, welcome home.
How was the 'moon?

09:15.466 --> 09:19.085
That's short for "honeymoon," it's... Yeah.

09:19.136 --> 09:21.054
Thought we might see you there,
given your track record.

09:21.121 --> 09:25.308
That's... You here
to see Lux? Yes.

09:25.392 --> 09:28.294
She's at Bug's. We can
tell her that you came by.

09:28.345 --> 09:32.649
What? We been here three hours.
He's already on our doorstep.

09:32.733 --> 09:34.350
Okay, I know, I know.

09:34.435 --> 09:36.286
Baze, you're gonna have to go.

09:36.353 --> 09:39.005
Yeah, listen, I didn't,
I didn't come just to see Lux.

09:42.943 --> 09:44.460
I really need to talk to you.

09:44.528 --> 09:45.478
No!

09:45.529 --> 09:47.113
Okay? This is not a good time.

09:47.164 --> 09:48.814
The last thing that
Ryan needs right now is

09:48.866 --> 09:50.366
to see me out here talking to you.

09:50.451 --> 09:53.203
Okay, I get that. You've moved on.

09:53.270 --> 09:56.289
And I am trying to, too.

09:56.340 --> 10:00.043
But in order for me to do that,
I really need to talk.

10:06.005 --> 10:07.485
Fine. Um...

10:09.305 --> 10:10.923
Meet me at Wallace
Park in an hour.

10:33.994 --> 10:35.578
Hey! Hey!

10:35.663 --> 10:36.579
Look who's here!

10:36.664 --> 10:37.863
Hey, Jamie.

10:37.915 --> 10:39.716
Hey, we missed your
little face around here.

10:39.800 --> 10:41.301
And your little hats. Oh, yeah.

10:41.368 --> 10:43.336
I think Bug did, too.
He was extra broody.

10:43.387 --> 10:47.056
Yeah. Um, is-is Baze around?

10:47.141 --> 10:48.291
He just left.

10:48.359 --> 10:49.726
Uh, try his cell.
You might catch him.

10:49.810 --> 10:50.843
Oh, that's okay.

10:50.894 --> 10:53.680
I was just gonna say hi.

10:53.731 --> 10:55.932
Baze is gonna be really
happy to see you.

10:56.016 --> 10:57.650
He's been pretty bummed
since the wedding.

10:57.718 --> 11:00.403
What you did, it was...
it meant a lot to him.

11:00.487 --> 11:02.405
I-I didn't do anything.

11:02.473 --> 11:04.073
You were on his side.

11:04.158 --> 11:07.293
And it made Cate choosing Ryan
a little easier, you know?

11:07.361 --> 11:09.596
Knowing that you wanted
Cate to choose him.

11:09.663 --> 11:12.949
All right, anyway, uh,
I'll be upstairs.

11:13.033 --> 11:15.234
Make yourself useful, all right?

11:27.214 --> 11:29.098
Wow. This place is popular.

11:29.166 --> 11:30.416
We're closed.

11:30.484 --> 11:33.970
Come on, look, I just moved into town,
and my friend said

11:34.054 --> 11:35.471
that you guys have sheepdog ale.

11:35.556 --> 11:38.625
Well, I guess your friend forgot
to mention our business hours.

11:40.094 --> 11:42.895
Or the cute but kind
of bitchy locals.

11:42.946 --> 11:44.130
Okay, wait.

11:44.198 --> 11:50.436
Wait, wait, wait, I'm-I'm sorry, I just...
Um... Let me see your I.D.

11:53.324 --> 11:54.940
Hmm.

11:54.992 --> 11:56.626
Minnesota!

11:56.710 --> 11:57.744
Mm-hmm. Hm.

11:57.811 --> 11:59.045
Clearly a fake.

12:01.532 --> 12:02.598
Five-nine?

12:02.666 --> 12:05.001
Sure.

12:05.085 --> 12:10.089
All right, just one, and then you
got to get out of here, Eric...

12:10.157 --> 12:12.175
Allister Daniels.

12:12.259 --> 12:13.926
You're a goddess.

12:13.994 --> 12:15.261
Yeah.

12:26.190 --> 12:28.408
I, uh, I told Ryan that I went out

12:28.475 --> 12:33.896
for triple sec and limes,
so... So... How are things?

12:33.964 --> 12:35.231
You know what, I'm not...

12:35.299 --> 12:37.200
I cannot keep doing this,
no... Wait, Cate.

12:37.284 --> 12:39.702
Doing what? I can't keep
showing up places thinking that

12:39.787 --> 12:41.587
you're gonna say something
substantial and meaningful

12:41.655 --> 12:43.923
and honest and then being
surprised when you don't.

12:43.990 --> 12:45.541
I love you.

12:45.609 --> 12:47.993
And I should've said it
that night on my deck

12:48.045 --> 12:50.880
when you said you loved me,
but I was just trying to...

12:50.964 --> 12:52.715
I was just trying
to let you be happy.

12:52.800 --> 12:54.467
And so I lied, and it wasn't fair.

12:54.518 --> 12:56.936
It's not fair to you
or to Ryan or to me.

12:57.003 --> 12:58.771
Screw you.

12:58.839 --> 13:00.273
Cate, wait. You know something?

13:00.340 --> 13:01.841
First of all,
I didn't say I loved you.

13:01.942 --> 13:03.693
I said what if a part of me

13:03.777 --> 13:06.062
was in love with you,
which is a totally different thing.

13:06.146 --> 13:07.563
Not really.
Okay, well, second of all,

13:07.648 --> 13:09.732
you know what's not fair? This.

13:09.817 --> 13:11.350
Begging for me to hear you out,

13:11.402 --> 13:13.536
you tearing me away
from my husband

13:13.620 --> 13:15.655
to tell me something
I already know.

13:15.706 --> 13:16.923
What do you think I thought, Baze?

13:16.990 --> 13:18.191
That you stormed into the church

13:18.258 --> 13:20.025
to tell me that I had
a parking ticket?

13:20.077 --> 13:21.461
Cate, listen, listen to me,
I am not trying

13:21.528 --> 13:22.545
to make you hate me more.

13:22.629 --> 13:24.163
I just want to fix things

13:24.214 --> 13:26.031
with you. Okay, well,
you can't fix things

13:26.083 --> 13:27.934
with me, Baze,
because we are broken.

13:31.338 --> 13:34.039
We're always gonna be broken.

13:38.312 --> 13:41.063
The real person that you
should fix things with is Lux.

13:41.148 --> 13:43.833
Wh-what is that supposed to mean?

13:43.901 --> 13:46.385
I am not getting into this with you.
No, wait, Cate,

13:46.437 --> 13:48.354
Cate, wait... What does that mean?

13:48.405 --> 13:50.907
Because Lux is the one person
that actually has faith in me...

13:50.974 --> 13:53.960
that believes in me, in us...
So why do I have to fix things?

13:54.027 --> 13:55.578
Because she doesn't
believe in us, Baze.

13:55.662 --> 13:57.597
Okay? She told me to marry Ryan.

13:57.664 --> 13:59.081
Do you not get it?

13:59.166 --> 14:02.568
I did not choose you.

14:02.619 --> 14:05.371
Neither did she.

14:23.747 --> 14:26.702
Okay, Rocco's...
Best pizza in Portland.

14:26.770 --> 14:28.737
Voodoo donuts. Let me guess.

14:28.822 --> 14:31.106
Best donuts?
No, it's okay.

14:31.191 --> 14:34.393
But I had a friend who
worked there, so... Ooh.

14:34.444 --> 14:36.328
So I kind of O.D.'d.

14:36.396 --> 14:37.429
Oh.

14:37.497 --> 14:39.665
I'm just gonna try
with the left hand.

14:39.732 --> 14:41.417
Wait.

14:41.484 --> 14:43.568
Are you married?

14:43.620 --> 14:45.821
Um... no.

14:45.889 --> 14:47.456
Uh, engaged.

14:47.540 --> 14:51.176
I know, I'm young, it's weird.

14:51.244 --> 14:53.362
No, no, it's not weird.

14:53.430 --> 14:56.582
As long as you
finish college first.

14:58.318 --> 15:02.087
Yeah, well, I don't think
it's gonna be anytime soon.

15:02.155 --> 15:06.925
There's just... There's a lot
of stuff that I haven't... done.

15:06.993 --> 15:08.494
Mm. Yeah, that's usually code

15:08.561 --> 15:10.511
for "I haven't dated
enough people."

15:18.337 --> 15:20.923
I... I haven't even
seen the ocean.

15:20.990 --> 15:22.775
Okay, you're saying that you feel

15:22.842 --> 15:25.244
like if you had seen
more of what's out there

15:25.311 --> 15:27.296
that you'd be ready
to marry this guy?

15:27.363 --> 15:29.431
I don't... I don't know, maybe.

15:29.499 --> 15:32.651
Okay, look, I can't tell you
anything about marriage,

15:32.702 --> 15:36.121
but I just got out of a relationship
that I never should have

15:36.189 --> 15:37.873
been in in the first place.

15:37.957 --> 15:41.710
So before you end up in something
that's hard to get out of,

15:41.778 --> 15:43.962
make sure you want to be there.

15:44.030 --> 15:45.998
You know? And if you think
going to see the ocean's

15:46.065 --> 15:47.966
gonna help you, go see the ocean.

15:48.034 --> 15:49.668
You make it sound so easy.

15:49.736 --> 15:52.037
It is. You could go tonight,
if you want.

15:53.089 --> 15:55.174
I mean... we could go.

15:55.225 --> 15:57.359
If you want.

15:57.427 --> 16:00.579
Right, because getting in a
car with a complete stranger

16:00.647 --> 16:02.548
isn't the dumbest move ever.

16:02.615 --> 16:03.932
Well...

16:05.652 --> 16:08.754
Not as dumb as
marrying the wrong guy.

16:23.185 --> 16:23.751
Where have you been?

16:23.755 --> 16:25.122
Ah, the usual.

16:25.130 --> 16:27.615
I was getting my
soul crushed by Cate.

16:27.683 --> 16:29.183
Here. From Lux.

16:29.234 --> 16:31.119
She was here earlier. Oh. Cool.

16:31.186 --> 16:32.820
"Baze, went back to Cate's.

16:32.871 --> 16:35.323
Sorry I missed you. Lux."

16:35.374 --> 16:39.494
This... this day, it just keeps
getting better and better.

16:39.561 --> 16:42.163
Okay, you know what's
gonna cheer you up?

16:42.214 --> 16:44.132
Our new bartender.

16:45.784 --> 16:47.018
Come on.

16:48.203 --> 16:50.138
Paige, Baze.

16:50.205 --> 16:52.390
Baze... Paige. Hi.

16:52.474 --> 16:56.144
- Hey. - Paige has been
everywhere and can make anything.

16:56.211 --> 16:58.313
She just got back from Tuscany.

16:58.380 --> 17:00.264
I'm drinking a Tuscan Sun.

17:00.332 --> 17:02.450
Ooh, wow.

17:02.518 --> 17:04.519
Drown your sorrows.

17:04.569 --> 17:06.654
You're good.

17:10.909 --> 17:14.945
We are going to the
Pacific, right?

17:15.030 --> 17:16.748
Well, you said it was

17:16.832 --> 17:18.950
two hours away... I didn't
know it'd take all night.

17:19.034 --> 17:20.451
You want to turn around, we can.

17:21.637 --> 17:24.204
That's okay.

17:26.275 --> 17:28.175
What was... what was that?

17:28.242 --> 17:29.677
What-what was that?

17:29.745 --> 17:31.179
Damn it. "Damn it"?

17:31.246 --> 17:33.431
Why-why-why "damn it"?

17:35.100 --> 17:36.985
Seriously, who runs out of gas?

17:37.052 --> 17:38.720
I know. It's my truck.

17:38.771 --> 17:40.938
I swear I just got
the gas gauge fixed

17:41.006 --> 17:42.357
before I drove across country.

17:44.926 --> 17:47.928
Okay, well,
I still have no signal,

17:47.980 --> 17:50.481
and I'm sorry,
but my phone is almost dead.

17:52.117 --> 17:54.485
Don't worry, I got a good
feeling about this one.

17:57.289 --> 17:59.707
No, no, no, no,
I'm not getting in a car

17:59.775 --> 18:01.342
with some random freak, again.

18:01.410 --> 18:02.577
Don't worry.

18:02.628 --> 18:05.146
I'm gonna give them
money to go get us gas.

18:05.214 --> 18:07.915
Oh, 'cause I'm sure
he'll come back.

18:07.983 --> 18:09.384
Buck up, Eeyore.

18:09.451 --> 18:11.552
People... they might surprise you.

18:11.620 --> 18:13.588
I hate this woman!

18:13.639 --> 18:14.788
All right, look, if you're

18:14.789 --> 18:16.557
gonna just yell at
that book all night...

18:16.625 --> 18:18.309
here... I'm just
gonna ask Lux to open

18:18.394 --> 18:20.962
the rest of the gifts with me
tonight when she gets home.

18:21.030 --> 18:22.263
Oh, she's staying
at Baze's tonight.

18:22.331 --> 18:24.282
She called while I was
getting the triple sec.

18:24.349 --> 18:25.966
I wondered what took you so long.

18:27.770 --> 18:30.188
Okay, you know what? So,
this Kelly woman,

18:30.272 --> 18:32.490
I mean, do you or do you not care

18:32.558 --> 18:34.192
that she is a total Stepford wife?

18:34.276 --> 18:36.110
I mean, who's not even a wife.

18:36.161 --> 18:38.479
You know, she thinks that
the feminist movement,

18:38.530 --> 18:42.283
Madonna and having it all are just
bad ideas that should go away.

18:42.334 --> 18:43.785
Oh, look. From Alice.

18:43.852 --> 18:46.037
Our first wedding photo...
It's nice.

18:46.121 --> 18:48.089
No. Untag.

18:48.156 --> 18:49.824
I look drunk.

18:51.260 --> 18:53.344
Oh, I mean,
what is Trina thinking?

18:53.429 --> 18:54.846
And what is Sandra
Bullock thinking?

18:54.930 --> 18:56.264
This would make a horrible movie.

19:00.185 --> 19:01.969
Oh, my God.

19:02.037 --> 19:03.554
No, that is way too nice

19:03.639 --> 19:05.973
to be from anyone on
my side of the family.

19:07.976 --> 19:09.510
Who's Julia?

19:09.561 --> 19:12.513
No, I don't know a Julia.

19:12.581 --> 19:14.632
Um, hmm, I don't know.

19:14.700 --> 19:17.401
A friend of my parents, I think.

19:17.486 --> 19:19.570
I'll, uh, I'll handle this one.

19:21.740 --> 19:25.025
See? That's how it
works in our marriage.

19:25.077 --> 19:28.696
We both write the thank-you notes,
and we both wear the pants.

19:30.716 --> 19:33.584
Usually. Well... Yeah.

19:33.669 --> 19:34.886
Okay.

19:34.970 --> 19:36.838
Last ones.

19:36.889 --> 19:39.257
Oh, good, because...
I think that my taste buds

19:39.341 --> 19:41.142
stopped functioning
about two hours ago.

19:41.209 --> 19:42.643
At least my vision did.

19:42.711 --> 19:45.396
Hey, Math,
ever had a bloody smurf?

19:47.933 --> 19:49.016
He'll be all right.

19:49.067 --> 19:51.302
I'll drag him up when I go to bed.

19:51.370 --> 19:52.620
It's the perk of living upstairs.

19:52.688 --> 19:53.888
Oh, yeah? Whoa.

19:53.956 --> 19:55.022
Uh-uh, no, no, no.

19:55.073 --> 19:58.292
You can't...
You can't smoke inside.

19:58.360 --> 19:59.727
It's bar rules.

19:59.795 --> 20:02.413
That's... What I miss about Bali.

20:02.481 --> 20:06.501
There, you can smoke at a gas
station while holding three babies.

20:06.568 --> 20:08.986
You're a little crazy, aren't you?

20:10.522 --> 20:12.456
You tell me.

20:12.524 --> 20:16.377
I mean... Unless you're
too drunk to find out.

20:29.055 --> 20:30.567
Can you admit it now?

20:35.574 --> 20:38.543
That guy's not coming back.

20:38.610 --> 20:40.644
Finally!

20:40.696 --> 20:42.646
All right.

20:42.748 --> 20:45.366
We're walking.

20:50.088 --> 20:53.541
I would have come back,
or I wouldn't have taken the money.

20:53.625 --> 20:55.460
Yes, but you are a good person.

20:55.511 --> 20:57.628
You were willing to
drive to the beach

20:57.696 --> 21:01.048
in the middle of the night just
to help me make a decision.

21:01.116 --> 21:03.301
And look how well that turned out.

21:04.586 --> 21:06.721
Maybe it's a sign.

21:06.805 --> 21:11.092
I mean, if it's this
hard to get to the ocean,

21:11.160 --> 21:13.611
maybe I'm not supposed to see it.

21:13.678 --> 21:15.730
Maybe that's the point.

21:15.814 --> 21:18.182
Whatever else is out there
doesn't really matter.

21:18.233 --> 21:20.184
What matters is
what I already know.

21:20.235 --> 21:22.036
And that's-that's my boyfriend.

21:22.120 --> 21:24.405
Or fiancÃ©? Or whatever.

21:24.490 --> 21:29.911
Wha... Are... Or maybe you're
looking at the wrong signs.

21:31.363 --> 21:32.497
Come on.

21:37.085 --> 21:40.221
I'm-I'm sorry, wh-what
are you doing? Come on.

21:40.305 --> 21:41.606
What are you doing?

21:41.673 --> 21:43.174
The water's fine! Come on!

21:44.359 --> 21:46.427
All right.

21:46.512 --> 21:47.845
Okay.

21:52.267 --> 21:55.553
So... What do you think?

21:55.621 --> 21:58.289
Wow!

21:58.357 --> 22:00.925
I think you're kind of crazy.

22:00.993 --> 22:02.610
Yeah.

22:02.694 --> 22:04.245
And how great is the ocean?

22:04.346 --> 22:07.665
It's a little smaller than
I thought it would be,

22:07.733 --> 22:12.620
and it kind of smells like paste,
but I love the view.

22:12.704 --> 22:14.589
So does it help?

22:14.673 --> 22:17.508
I mean, seeing it?

22:21.146 --> 22:26.684
You know, you don't know me at all,
and I don't even care

22:26.751 --> 22:31.639
that this isn't really the ocean,
but I just... I needed this.

22:34.076 --> 22:37.178
Thank you for bringing me here.

22:53.879 --> 23:00.051
Eric, I... I shouldn't,
I... I shouldn't do this.

23:03.088 --> 23:07.925
Oh, my God... They came back!

23:09.461 --> 23:10.411
Come on!

23:10.479 --> 23:12.647
What?!

23:12.731 --> 23:15.316
Come on. Careful.

23:54.773 --> 23:56.340
Hey, call me when you can.

23:56.391 --> 23:58.075
I'm in town for a bit.

23:58.143 --> 23:59.777
I'm totally serious about
sticking around this time.

23:59.844 --> 24:03.314
I, uh, scored this awesome job,

24:03.365 --> 24:05.683
but I'm gonna need a
place to crash for a bit.

24:05.734 --> 24:07.952
So call me.

24:29.040 --> 24:30.874
Here.

24:30.926 --> 24:31.992
Oh. My number.

24:34.363 --> 24:37.815
In case you wanna go see
something else sometime.

24:37.882 --> 24:40.418
All right.

24:40.485 --> 24:45.806
Well, um, thank you... For
showing me the ocean, Minnesota.

24:45.874 --> 24:48.759
Anytime, Eeyore.

25:02.240 --> 25:06.544
Good morning, Portland!

25:06.595 --> 25:08.946
Cate and I are back
from our honeymoon.

25:09.014 --> 25:10.931
Ah, yes, and we did not
return empty-handed.

25:10.999 --> 25:16.153
We'd like to introduce the latest
addition to Morning Madness:

25:16.221 --> 25:18.606
Best-selling author,
social commentator

25:18.673 --> 25:20.558
and marriage expert,
Kelly Campbell.

25:20.609 --> 25:22.193
Kelly, welcome.

25:22.260 --> 25:23.427
Nice to meet you, Portland.

25:23.478 --> 25:25.413
And it's great to be
here with you, Ryan.

25:27.099 --> 25:29.033
And Cate.

25:43.765 --> 25:46.917
Hey... Hey!

25:46.985 --> 25:48.636
Jamie, Math!

25:52.524 --> 25:53.841
Wake up!

25:53.909 --> 25:55.576
Hey, Jamie!

25:55.644 --> 25:58.012
Hey, do you smell that?

25:58.079 --> 26:00.097
Is that... is that smoke?

26:00.165 --> 26:01.315
Is it the bar?!

26:05.437 --> 26:08.122
Whoa! God!

26:09.991 --> 26:11.308
Do we have a fire extinguisher?

26:11.376 --> 26:13.661
No! Go, go, go!

26:13.745 --> 26:15.279
Go!

26:19.551 --> 26:20.951
Okay, we're back
at Morning Madness.

26:21.019 --> 26:24.238
I'm Ryan Thomas here with Cate
Cassidy and Kelly Campbell

26:24.272 --> 26:26.990
duking it out over the
question of the morning:

26:27.042 --> 26:28.325
"Can women have it all?"

26:28.376 --> 26:32.129
And I gotta say, I-I tend to
side with Cate on this one.

26:32.197 --> 26:35.282
Sure. You're still in your
second week of marriage.

26:35.350 --> 26:36.267
Just wait.

26:36.334 --> 26:38.052
I'm sorry.

26:38.136 --> 26:40.387
Uh, first of all,
you barely know us.

26:40.472 --> 26:43.274
Second of all... and stop
me if this was covered

26:43.341 --> 26:45.810
in your fourth chapter, uh,
"Barefoot and Pregnant:

26:45.861 --> 26:47.294
Who needs Manolos anyways?

26:47.362 --> 26:50.865
Why would a grown woman actual...

26:52.467 --> 26:56.609
Her point being, in what way
does Cate not have it all?

26:56.796 --> 27:00.023
She has a husband,
she has a kid, a career...

27:00.075 --> 27:01.826
But there's no way she
can do it all well.

27:01.877 --> 27:06.547
That's why I believe that a woman
should pursue her career first.

27:06.631 --> 27:08.365
Then when she's ready, she should

27:08.416 --> 27:09.500
give it up for marriage and kids.

27:09.551 --> 27:10.668
That's my plan.

27:10.735 --> 27:12.720
So you should have
called your book,

27:12.804 --> 27:14.989
"You can't have it all
at the same time".

27:15.056 --> 27:17.675
Ryan, don't be so literal.

27:17.726 --> 27:19.660
The color purple
isn't about crayons.

27:19.728 --> 27:23.046
Face it. Cate probably has
no idea what her kid is up to

27:23.098 --> 27:24.231
most of the time.

27:24.316 --> 27:28.519
Her career has been
in a holding pattern.

27:28.587 --> 27:30.387
And with her focus spread
so thin, your marriage

27:30.438 --> 27:32.823
is completely open and
vulnerable to the next crisis.

27:36.077 --> 27:37.912
Oh, wow. Okay, what do you say we,

27:37.979 --> 27:40.197
uh... what do you say
we take some calls?

27:40.248 --> 27:41.165
Great.

27:41.232 --> 27:43.784
Oh!

27:43.869 --> 27:45.419
We're fine. We're fine.

27:45.503 --> 27:47.905
The bar, on the other hand,
is not.

27:47.956 --> 27:50.457
Hey! Hey, take my calls next time!

27:50.525 --> 27:53.594
Okay, it's not like I knew
that the bar was on fire!

27:53.678 --> 27:55.629
I'm glad that you're okay.
Can I talk to Lux?

27:55.697 --> 27:56.363
What?

27:56.431 --> 27:58.749
Can I talk to Lux?!

27:58.800 --> 28:00.017
Lux isn't here.
That's why I'm calling.

28:00.084 --> 28:03.470
No, no, she-she said that she
stayed at the bar last night.

28:03.555 --> 28:05.306
She stayed at the bar last night.

28:05.390 --> 28:08.776
No, no, she left me a note.
She's staying at your place.

28:08.860 --> 28:09.860
I swear to God,
she never came home.

28:09.928 --> 28:10.895
She said that she was with you!

28:10.946 --> 28:12.446
I didn't see her.

28:12.530 --> 28:14.882
Are you 100% sure that
she is not in there?

28:14.950 --> 28:18.268
No, no, I didn't see her.
I didn't see her.

28:18.320 --> 28:20.537
No, Baze, no! I gotta get Lux!

28:20.605 --> 28:22.656
No, Baze! Dude! Baze! Dude!

28:33.473 --> 28:34.083
No, he's, um,

28:34.122 --> 28:37.642
he's still with the doctors...
We haven't heard anything yet.

28:37.726 --> 28:42.430
Uh-huh, yeah, I've left
about 800 messages for Lux.

28:44.900 --> 28:47.135
Okay, Ryan, she's here.
I'm gonna go. Bye.

28:47.202 --> 28:48.969
Cate, I'm so sorry.

28:49.021 --> 28:50.888
I, I got your messages.
My phone was dead.

28:50.956 --> 28:52.674
Is Baze okay?

28:52.741 --> 28:54.459
Uh, we don't really know.

28:54.526 --> 28:55.860
We're still waiting to hear.

28:55.928 --> 28:57.462
Are you okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:57.529 --> 28:58.880
Yeah, I'm fine.

28:58.947 --> 29:00.748
Okay, well, then where
have you been all night?

29:00.816 --> 29:03.651
Um... I was at-at Bug's.

29:03.702 --> 29:06.754
And by the time I got home
this morning, you were already

29:06.822 --> 29:09.857
gone for work, so... So, what,
you lied to me and Baze

29:09.925 --> 29:12.160
about sleeping at the
other person's house,

29:12.227 --> 29:15.296
and then you snuck back in
after you knew that I was gone?

29:15.364 --> 29:17.298
Do you have any idea
what you put us through?

29:17.349 --> 29:18.499
We were out-of-our-minds
worried about you!

29:18.567 --> 29:19.650
Okay, Cate, I screwed up!

29:19.718 --> 29:23.554
I'm sorry. I just...
Is he gonna be okay?

29:23.622 --> 29:25.523
Lux, he ran into a
burning building

29:25.607 --> 29:27.625
because I told him
that you were in there.

29:27.693 --> 29:29.977
So, no, he's not
really gonna be okay.

29:30.045 --> 29:34.348
I'm looking for Nathaniel
Bazile's relatives.

29:35.984 --> 29:37.184
How's my son?

29:37.236 --> 29:38.986
He suffered from severe
smoke inhalation,

29:39.038 --> 29:40.571
so we still have him on oxygen.

29:40.656 --> 29:43.190
And he's groggy.
We'll keep him on painkillers

29:43.242 --> 29:45.426
for a couple of days to treat
the second-degree burns.

29:45.494 --> 29:46.828
But he's gonna be fine.

29:46.895 --> 29:48.629
It could've been a lot worse.

29:48.697 --> 29:53.201
Can we see him? Uh, maybe just
one of you for a few minutes.

29:54.720 --> 29:56.304
You go ahead.

30:26.285 --> 30:28.286
Hi. Hi.

30:28.353 --> 30:30.888
Word on the street is
you're gonna be okay.

30:30.956 --> 30:31.973
Yeah.

30:32.040 --> 30:33.708
I'm sorry.

30:33.759 --> 30:35.760
Lux is here.

30:35.828 --> 30:37.228
Huh. She's fine.

30:37.296 --> 30:39.097
Huh.

30:40.432 --> 30:44.569
You know, when I heard that you
ran back into that building,

30:44.636 --> 30:46.971
I never want what I
said to you in that park

30:47.039 --> 30:49.157
to be the last thing
that I ever said to you.

30:51.660 --> 30:53.995
Lux... she loves you.

30:54.062 --> 30:56.814
Whether or not she thinks
that we should be together

30:56.882 --> 31:00.568
has nothing to do with
how much she loves you.

31:00.636 --> 31:02.770
You should know that.

31:04.506 --> 31:06.607
I lost everything.

31:06.658 --> 31:09.694
Okay, well, they said that the
damage was mostly inside the bar.

31:09.761 --> 31:14.232
The loft, it's still livable...
Not just the bar... You.

31:17.002 --> 31:19.303
I just want to know
that you don't hate me.

31:19.371 --> 31:23.391
What I said in the park,
it wasn't fair. It was selfish.

31:23.459 --> 31:25.676
And I don't want to
be selfish anymore.

31:25.744 --> 31:28.529
I don't hate you.

31:31.033 --> 31:33.868
I could never hate you.

31:39.641 --> 31:42.510
I'm gonna let you get some rest.

31:47.749 --> 31:50.134
Hey, Cate? Huh?

31:50.202 --> 31:52.737
It, it wouldn't have mattered.

31:52.804 --> 31:55.806
What?

31:55.874 --> 31:59.043
If I'd gotten to
the church earlier.

31:59.111 --> 32:00.511
It wouldn't have mattered, right?

32:04.933 --> 32:06.117
Get some rest.

32:35.380 --> 32:36.397
How's Baze?

32:36.465 --> 32:37.798
Well, they're only letting Cate

32:37.866 --> 32:39.534
see him right now.
How did you know?

32:39.601 --> 32:41.168
Jamie called me.
He told me what happened.

32:41.236 --> 32:42.737
Where were you? I've been
trying to call you all night.

32:42.804 --> 32:44.589
I-I don't know.

32:44.673 --> 32:47.458
I mean, I-I do know.
It's-it's stupid.

32:47.526 --> 32:52.029
I... I went to see the ocean.

32:52.097 --> 32:54.181
What are you talking about?

32:54.233 --> 32:55.933
Well, I had never seen it.

32:56.001 --> 32:57.768
And, I don't know.
I-I was confused.

32:57.836 --> 33:00.021
I thought it might help
me make up my mind.

33:00.072 --> 33:01.989
About what?

33:02.057 --> 33:06.744
Bug... I messed up.

33:06.812 --> 33:09.080
I said yes because
I couldn't say no.

33:09.147 --> 33:11.582
I don't know how to
deal with all this.

33:11.667 --> 33:13.567
No. No, Bug, wait.

33:15.520 --> 33:17.505
I love you.

33:17.572 --> 33:19.040
I do.

33:19.091 --> 33:21.959
But there is so much in this
world that we haven't seen.

33:22.044 --> 33:24.045
And people that we haven't met.

33:24.096 --> 33:25.846
I don't need to meet
any other people.

33:27.916 --> 33:30.334
Who took you to the ocean?

33:30.402 --> 33:32.119
That-that's not the point.

33:32.187 --> 33:33.638
Who took you?

33:33.722 --> 33:36.307
Bug, you've been my whole life.

33:36.375 --> 33:42.747
I want to be with you now,
but I can't promise you forever.

33:45.651 --> 33:48.953
I don't want to change
things between us, but...

33:53.125 --> 33:54.875
You just did.

33:54.943 --> 33:56.610
Wait, that's not fair.

33:56.662 --> 33:58.296
I was happy how we were,

33:58.363 --> 34:00.464
and then you went and
asked me a question

34:00.532 --> 34:02.166
that no normal 16-year-old
should have to answer.

34:02.250 --> 34:05.286
Do you think now that you have
Cate and Baze you're different?

34:07.372 --> 34:10.007
What makes you think you
could ever be normal?

34:26.627 --> 34:28.460
Hey.

34:36.253 --> 34:38.437
I'm just going to get my stuff.

34:40.641 --> 34:42.608
We need to talk.

34:42.693 --> 34:45.378
Yeah, I-I'm so sorry that,
you know, I just ran off.

34:45.445 --> 34:47.063
There was a fire at Baze's bar.

34:47.114 --> 34:49.931
But everyone is fine.
I just... We're letting you go.

34:49.983 --> 34:52.451
Go where?

34:52.536 --> 34:54.453
Cate, they're,
uh... we're firing you.

34:54.521 --> 34:57.507
What, because I left for an emergency,
you're firing us?

34:57.574 --> 34:58.958
Not us.

34:59.026 --> 35:00.276
You.

35:00.344 --> 35:02.211
And it's not because you left.

35:02.279 --> 35:05.248
It's no secret.
I've never been a fan.

35:05.299 --> 35:09.418
I find you grating, abrasive... 
Trina, enough.

35:09.486 --> 35:10.953
You both knew ratings were down.

35:11.004 --> 35:13.089
We wanted to make a
change for a while now.

35:13.157 --> 35:14.557
And you leaving today

35:14.624 --> 35:17.760
gave us a chance to hear Ryan
on the air with someone else.

35:17.828 --> 35:21.848
You said it yourself, Cate,
it's a two-person show.

35:21.932 --> 35:23.966
Ryan and Kelly debut tomorrow.

35:32.860 --> 35:35.077
Come here. Look, I'm so sorry.

35:35.145 --> 35:36.779
It's going to be all right.

35:39.283 --> 35:41.050
Yeah, well,
I guess Kelly was right.

35:41.118 --> 35:44.754
I can't have it all.

35:51.879 --> 35:53.996
Oh.

36:02.773 --> 36:05.107
The structure's intact, at least.

36:05.175 --> 36:08.510
When I spoke to the fire chief
he said that he found remains

36:08.562 --> 36:11.647
of a cigarette at the source.

36:13.984 --> 36:15.184
Paige. Huh?

36:15.252 --> 36:16.685
Paige, our new bartender.

36:16.737 --> 36:19.238
The... our ex-new bartender.

36:19.323 --> 36:21.774
Yeah, but they said the
fire started in the morning.

36:21.842 --> 36:27.163
Yeah, well... Aw, Nate, come on.

36:27.214 --> 36:29.415
What-what-what kind of a...?

36:33.537 --> 36:36.472
I'm sorry.

36:36.539 --> 36:39.208
I want to be the one to fix this.

36:39.259 --> 36:41.494
I want to be the one
to make this right.

36:41.561 --> 36:46.565
I'm going to rebuild this
bar from the ground up...

36:46.650 --> 36:49.318
And fix everything else
in my life that's broken.

37:02.449 --> 37:05.618
Are you sure you're going to be
all right at home all day, alone?

37:05.686 --> 37:07.353
'Cause I could skip school.

37:07.421 --> 37:09.571
Well, that way I could
keep an eye on you.

37:09.623 --> 37:12.458
You know, make sure
you don't go to Bug's.

37:12.542 --> 37:14.927
I don't think that's going
to be a problem anymore.

37:21.468 --> 37:23.803
Lux, it's okay.

37:23.887 --> 37:27.273
It's okay. You can't
avoid him forever, okay?

37:27.357 --> 37:28.975
So go and talk to him.

37:30.927 --> 37:32.445
You can do it.

37:48.045 --> 37:49.528
Ow. Easy.

37:49.596 --> 37:52.498
Oh, sorry. I'm sorry that...
you got hurt.

37:52.582 --> 37:54.467
That I-I hurt you.

37:54.551 --> 37:55.835
It's okay, kiddo.

37:55.919 --> 37:57.336
No, it's not.

37:57.421 --> 37:59.638
Everything... it's my fault.
Hey, I am done

37:59.706 --> 38:02.942
beating myself up for things I
should have done differently.

38:03.010 --> 38:04.043
Don't you start.

38:04.111 --> 38:06.729
I want to move forward.

38:06.797 --> 38:09.815
And it's all going to
be better than ever.

38:09.900 --> 38:13.185
Even if it doesn't
seem like it right now.

38:16.773 --> 38:19.425
I saw Bug.

38:19.493 --> 38:22.478
He came by the bar.

38:22.529 --> 38:24.563
He's gone.

38:53.560 --> 38:58.314
Hey, I'm at work. I can't... Yes,
yeah, we got the vase.

38:58.365 --> 39:00.649
You didn't... you
didn't need to do that.

39:00.717 --> 39:03.803
Julia, you don't
need to apologize.

39:03.870 --> 39:04.904
The wedding happened.

39:04.988 --> 39:06.188
She never knew anything was wrong.

39:06.239 --> 39:07.823
It's over, it's done.

39:07.874 --> 39:09.859
Yeah.

39:09.926 --> 39:11.110
Yeah, you, too.

39:11.178 --> 39:12.545
Okay, bye.

39:13.780 --> 39:15.714
Welcome back, Portland.

39:15.782 --> 39:17.349
If you're just tuning in,

39:17.417 --> 39:19.701
more mad changes here
at Morning Madness.

39:19.753 --> 39:23.205
My wife, Cate Cassidy...

39:23.256 --> 39:27.226
Has opted to spend more
time with her family.

39:27.310 --> 39:30.262
I'm proud to say our family.

39:30.347 --> 39:33.099
And even though that may
just mean she's-she's home

39:33.166 --> 39:38.788
online shopping and-and day drinking,
I want her to know that...

39:38.855 --> 39:41.157
I want her to know
that I've been lucky.

39:43.176 --> 39:45.744
I've really been lucky to
have her as my partner on-air

39:45.812 --> 39:48.614
for the last three years.

39:48.682 --> 39:52.318
And I'm even luckier to have
her as my partner off the air.

39:52.385 --> 39:55.604
Stay tuned for more
Morning Madness.

39:56.623 --> 39:58.140
Right here on Portland's own...

40:00.410 --> 40:02.077
Paige.

40:02.129 --> 40:03.095
Hey, Cate.

40:03.180 --> 40:04.463
Is Ryan here?

40:04.548 --> 40:06.882
No. Your brother's
still at the station.

40:06.950 --> 40:08.601
Oh... why don't you come...

40:10.187 --> 40:11.937
...in?

40:12.022 --> 40:13.639
Oh, dude.

40:13.723 --> 40:16.692
You guys scored on
the gifts. Nice.

40:16.760 --> 40:19.261
Wha...?

40:53.813 --> 40:55.648
No way.

40:55.715 --> 40:56.932
You go here?

40:56.983 --> 40:58.217
I'm such a sucker.

40:58.285 --> 41:00.519
I knew that I.D. was fake.

41:00.604 --> 41:03.088
Hey. Ah, I see you've
met Mr. Daniels.

41:04.407 --> 41:05.624
What?

41:05.692 --> 41:07.476
Our newest addition to
the English department.

41:07.527 --> 41:10.613
He's filling in while Mrs.
Copeland's on maternity leave.

41:12.616 --> 41:15.651
You're a... teacher.

41:15.702 --> 41:20.005
I'm guessing from the backpack, you're a... 
Yep.
