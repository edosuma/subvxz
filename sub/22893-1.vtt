WEBVTT

00:04.880 --> 00:06.996
...this is a busy time.

00:07.080 --> 00:09.355
- So, if you wanna shop...
- Maybe a pedicure.

00:09.440 --> 00:11.476
A pedicure?

00:11.560 --> 00:12.616
Okay, that's where we draw the line.

00:12.640 --> 00:13.993
That's it.

00:14.080 --> 00:16.116
But in any event,
go to today.com

00:16.200 --> 00:18.111
for all the rules
and regulations

00:18.200 --> 00:20.714
and what you need to do,
'cause I'd love to come

00:20.800 --> 00:23.519
and wake up with you.
All right.

00:25.160 --> 00:27.116
Breakfast, tractor driving,
and shoveling...

00:27.200 --> 00:28.736
Hey, big Boston Marathon,

00:28.760 --> 00:29.875
9:00 a.m. tomorrow.

00:29.960 --> 00:31.678
The wheelchairs go off
by noon.

00:31.800 --> 00:33.916
Temperature about 50.
Partly sunny.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.753
3:00, 55 degrees
and light winds.

00:36.840 --> 00:38.239
It's gonna be a perfect day.

00:42.200 --> 00:43.656
You know,
there is a renewed hope

00:43.680 --> 00:45.480
for the Red Sox
after two of the last plays...

00:48.280 --> 00:50.555
Here we go, John.
Feeling good about this year.

00:51.800 --> 00:52.960
- You said it.
- Go Sox.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:01.400 --> 01:02.913
Seriously?

01:16.240 --> 01:18.913
Hey, Tom! Don't spray.
I'm walkin' through here.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.399
What's that smell?

01:23.040 --> 01:24.712
Shit.

01:27.280 --> 01:28.793
Ah! Shit!

01:28.880 --> 01:29.880
What'd you do?

01:29.960 --> 01:31.016
The chicken on the timer,

01:31.040 --> 01:32.096
I didn't turn on by mistake,

01:32.120 --> 01:33.776
so I didn't hear the noise,
I didn't hear the beep.

01:33.800 --> 01:35.376
And if you hear the beeps,
then you'd be able to stop 'em...

01:35.400 --> 01:36.469
You're supposed to

01:36.560 --> 01:38.136
clear the roasters before
you empty the trash, Jeff.

01:38.160 --> 01:39.456
...'cause I didn't hear
the beeps.

01:39.480 --> 01:42.517
Okay, Maya, I'll sign off on an hour
of OT, so Jeff can help clean up.

01:42.600 --> 01:44.736
- Does that work for both of you guys?
- Actually, sir, there's...

01:44.760 --> 01:47.069
I have something I gotta do.

01:47.160 --> 01:48.479
What do you got's
so important...

01:48.560 --> 01:50.994
You just make this big mess
and leave me here to clean it up?

01:51.080 --> 01:54.356
Look, the Sox lost two in a row
because of me, all right?

01:54.440 --> 01:56.351
I missed both games
because I was at work.

01:56.440 --> 01:58.136
You know, I wasn't in my lucky seat
with my lucky beer.

01:58.160 --> 02:00.230
You got a lucky beer?

02:00.320 --> 02:01.435
Yeah, I mean, I just...

02:01.520 --> 02:02.873
Beer in general's lucky,
right?

02:02.960 --> 02:04.916
Okay, this is your call, Maya.

02:08.080 --> 02:10.071
All right.

02:10.160 --> 02:11.559
I got you. Look at you.

02:11.640 --> 02:12.640
Thank you, Maya.

02:12.720 --> 02:14.039
You owe me.

02:15.080 --> 02:16.399
Do me a favor, sir.

02:16.480 --> 02:17.656
Don't report
our office romance, okay?

02:17.680 --> 02:19.000
I know it's against
Costco policy,

02:19.040 --> 02:20.336
but sometimes you gotta
make a sacrifice, right?

02:20.360 --> 02:21.998
Please go watch the game.

02:26.120 --> 02:27.951
Here's my baby boy.

02:28.040 --> 02:29.776
- Can I get another pitcher?
- Don't you think

02:29.800 --> 02:31.153
he's gettin' too skinny,
Patty?

02:31.240 --> 02:32.336
And he needs
a fuckin' haircut.

02:32.360 --> 02:34.032
Friggin' perfect.

02:34.120 --> 02:35.394
Look at that face.

02:35.480 --> 02:37.072
The face is cute.

02:37.160 --> 02:38.559
Shit!

02:38.640 --> 02:39.914
Oh, Ma, hey.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.718
- She's good.
- Careful, there.

02:41.800 --> 02:42.856
You wanna sit somewhere lower?
That fall's a doozy.

02:42.880 --> 02:44.632
Yeah, you go
fuck yourself, sweetie.

02:44.720 --> 02:46.950
All right, thanks. Hey.

02:48.720 --> 02:50.312
He's my favorite nephew.

02:52.400 --> 02:53.400
Jesus, Jeff,

02:53.480 --> 02:55.056
you still smell like
fuckin' chicken carcasses.

02:55.080 --> 02:57.036
Buchholz is on fire.
Look at him.

02:57.120 --> 02:59.056
- He's a fuckin' beast.
- That coulda been you, D.

02:59.080 --> 03:00.513
- On TV. Rich and famous.
- Yeah.

03:00.600 --> 03:03.558
Quit pitchin' in high school
like a fuckin' pussy.

03:05.720 --> 03:07.312
You're a pussy.
Shut up, faggot.

03:07.400 --> 03:08.799
Nobody says "faggot"
anymore, D.

03:08.880 --> 03:10.256
Oh, really? What do you
know about it, huh?

03:10.280 --> 03:11.998
What do you mean?
I'm down with the homos.

03:12.080 --> 03:13.991
- My boss at Costco's gay.
- Your fuckin' boss?

03:14.080 --> 03:15.559
You think
I get this fashionable

03:15.640 --> 03:17.416
without it's some sort of
fuckin' insider help?

03:17.440 --> 03:18.576
For the record, hey...

03:18.600 --> 03:20.216
For the record,
I didn't pussy outta shit.

03:20.240 --> 03:21.856
I had a herniated disk.
You both know that.

03:21.880 --> 03:23.976
Shut the fuck up, both of you.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.353
You 're an asshole. Shut up.

03:25.440 --> 03:27.158
Who you callin' a faggot,
Derek?

03:27.240 --> 03:29.376
No, apparently we don't say
that word no more, Uncle Bob.

03:29.400 --> 03:30.958
You know,
Jeff's boss is a gay.

03:33.280 --> 03:34.872
What? He is!

03:34.960 --> 03:36.951
Have you been...
Where have you been?

03:37.040 --> 03:38.720
Not with
the rest of us, apparently.

03:41.800 --> 03:43.711
Bauman?
You havin' a stroke or somethin'?

03:46.240 --> 03:48.276
Oh, shit. Look who's here.

03:51.760 --> 03:52.988
Hey, give me a second.

03:53.080 --> 03:54.336
Nobody wants to fuck a guy
with chicken in his hair.

03:54.360 --> 03:56.271
Why you touchin' my hair,
Uncle Bob?

03:56.360 --> 03:58.828
Come back after she tells you
to go fuck yourself, okay?

03:58.920 --> 04:00.433
Sit down
and watch the game, bro.

04:01.720 --> 04:03.915
She broke up with you.

04:08.320 --> 04:11.357
Hey.

04:12.800 --> 04:14.552
- Are you...
- What?

04:14.640 --> 04:16.437
Are...

04:20.120 --> 04:22.315
- The sister's here.
- Who? Gail?

04:22.400 --> 04:24.118
- Yeah.
- She looks good, though.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.756
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:28.840 --> 04:30.068
I, like... I texted you,

04:30.160 --> 04:31.752
like, six times.
You never get...

04:31.840 --> 04:33.990
Did you get my texts or not?

04:34.080 --> 04:36.514
Yeah, yeah, I did.
Yeah, I got 'em.

04:36.600 --> 04:37.953
Cool.

04:43.920 --> 04:46.354
- Hey, Gail.
- Jeff.

04:46.440 --> 04:48.237
So what are you two
Amesbury ladies

04:48.320 --> 04:49.799
slummin' it here for, anyway?

04:49.880 --> 04:52.440
I'm collecting donations
for the Marathon.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.676
- No shit?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

04:54.760 --> 04:56.910
- All right.
- Yep.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.231
You got a jar, huh?
With pictures of yourself.

05:00.360 --> 05:01.395
That's so great.

05:01.480 --> 05:02.896
So you show people
pictures of yourself

05:02.920 --> 05:05.195
- and then you ask for money.
- Yes. It usually works.

05:05.280 --> 05:07.316
That's very...
That's a smart idea.

05:07.400 --> 05:08.992
It feels like
you're self-promoting.

05:09.120 --> 05:10.758
- That's really...
- I am.

05:10.840 --> 05:12.239
That's literally what I'm doing.

05:12.320 --> 05:14.016
Yeah, but you know what?
Like, if you try and pass this

05:14.040 --> 05:15.296
around with
pictures of yourself,

05:15.320 --> 05:16.639
it's gonna be like, it's...

05:16.720 --> 05:18.096
You shouldn't do that.
You need my help.

05:18.120 --> 05:20.236
- I already got...
- You're gonna need inside help.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.550
Oh, really?
Gonna give money or what?

05:22.640 --> 05:24.039
No. Hey! Listen up!

05:25.200 --> 05:26.474
Hear ye! Hear ye!

05:26.560 --> 05:27.560
Give me a heart attack.

05:27.680 --> 05:29.193
Citizens of Chelmsford!

05:29.280 --> 05:30.576
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Citizens of Chelmsford!

05:30.600 --> 05:31.669
Jeff. Jeff.

05:31.760 --> 05:34.274
This young lady here
is running the Marathon

05:34.360 --> 05:37.193
for Brigham
and Women's Hospital. Okay?

05:37.280 --> 05:40.113
Where she also works
as a big-shot administrator.

05:40.200 --> 05:42.873
So skip a round o' Stella,
ya fat fucks!

05:42.960 --> 05:45.793
And donate to a good cause.

05:45.880 --> 05:47.279
Yeah!

05:49.320 --> 05:50.514
Hey, listen.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.556
Put your moolah
in the fishbowl.

05:52.640 --> 05:55.279
Just a couple o' bucks.
All right?

05:55.360 --> 05:56.509
Here ya go.

05:56.600 --> 05:58.096
- She'll take food stamps...
- Stop smiling!

05:58.120 --> 05:59.656
...Chuck E. Cheese tickets,
whatever you got.

05:59.680 --> 06:01.238
- You are such a...
- What?

06:01.320 --> 06:03.356
Whoever thought
you'd end up being in, like,

06:03.440 --> 06:06.113
this torrid melodrama with
a chicken roaster from Costco?

06:06.200 --> 06:08.430
What do you have against him?
He's a nice guy.

06:08.520 --> 06:11.353
You broke up with him three times.
Real nice.

06:11.440 --> 06:14.079
Erin! E.

06:14.160 --> 06:17.914
E, E, E, E!
Hey. Hey. Hey, hey.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.752
Can I come cheer ya on?

06:19.840 --> 06:22.070
Why don't you
run it with her, Jeff?

06:22.160 --> 06:23.560
Well, you know,
I suffered an injury

06:23.640 --> 06:24.959
from a chicken-related

06:25.040 --> 06:26.776
industrial accident today,
Gail, so, you know.

06:26.800 --> 06:28.696
But, hey, I'm gonna be there
at the finish line for ya.

06:28.720 --> 06:30.073
Don't the Red Sox
play tomorrow?

06:31.520 --> 06:34.398
- So?
- So?

06:34.480 --> 06:36.994
I'm gonna make
a big sign for ya!

06:37.080 --> 06:40.152
I mean, that's gotta be worth
at least a dinner, right?

06:40.240 --> 06:41.616
- Bye, Jeff.
- No, come on, I mean it!

06:41.640 --> 06:43.440
I mean it.
Hey, I'm gonna be there, all right?

06:43.520 --> 06:45.033
Take care
of your finger, Jeff.

06:45.120 --> 06:46.216
Hey, I'll be there, all right?

06:46.240 --> 06:48.400
- Dinner's pushing it!
- You're gonna win it all!

06:48.480 --> 06:50.232
E. E!

06:52.240 --> 06:54.037
So lunch it is?

07:13.000 --> 07:15.355
Oh, yeah. Go Sox.

07:35.640 --> 07:37.676
It's too high.

07:37.760 --> 07:40.274
God. Never again.

07:42.040 --> 07:44.873
- Jeffrey!
- What, Ma?

07:44.960 --> 07:47.554
Will you get me some aspirin?
'Cause I can't reach.

07:47.640 --> 07:50.677
Is there a...
You have an orange marker?

07:50.760 --> 07:52.193
- Ma!
- Yeah!

07:52.280 --> 07:54.157
There's an orange marker.
It was right here.

07:54.240 --> 07:55.880
- Don't make me shout, baby.
- Never mind.

07:55.960 --> 07:58.190
Tiny mice
with big hammers in my skull.

07:58.280 --> 07:59.713
I can't reach the aspirin.

07:59.800 --> 08:01.518
Ma, it's on the...

08:05.280 --> 08:07.840
I'm gonna be late.

08:07.920 --> 08:10.753
My God. Why do you
always put it up here?

08:10.840 --> 08:13.434
Who puts it up here?
I don't understand.

08:13.520 --> 08:15.238
- Thank you, baby.
- It's a new one. Yeah.

08:15.320 --> 08:16.719
Okay. All right.

08:16.800 --> 08:19.360
Hey, Can...
Can you fix the chirpy thing?

08:19.440 --> 08:21.112
- What?
- Chirpy chirp.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.136
What? You mean the low battery
alarm on the smoke detector?

08:23.160 --> 08:24.496
Yeah, it's driving me
bat-shit crazy.

08:24.520 --> 08:26.397
That's not a long drive.

08:26.480 --> 08:27.833
You can't have
Uncle Bob come by

08:27.920 --> 08:29.512
and do it on his way to work?

08:29.600 --> 08:30.999
Jesus Christ.

08:31.080 --> 08:32.149
What you got there?

08:33.679 --> 08:35.635
It's just a thing.

08:35.720 --> 08:37.880
I don't know why you keep
tryin' with that girl anyway.

08:40.080 --> 08:41.638
Hey, wait, I made breakfast.

08:44.840 --> 08:47.638
More than 27,000 runners

08:47.720 --> 08:50.473
are running in today's
Boston Marathon.

08:50.560 --> 08:52.676
The race is just now
getting underway.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.518
More than
half a million people...

09:26.200 --> 09:28.634
Oh, that's your brother?

09:28.720 --> 09:30.392
What's... What's his name?

09:33.640 --> 09:34.914
Go, Chris!

09:39.760 --> 09:42.354
Is that guy runnin'
in his underwear like that?

09:42.440 --> 09:44.396
What's that about?

09:45.680 --> 09:46.908
Ah!

10:34.880 --> 10:36.496
Coming up in a big plume.

10:36.520 --> 10:37.999
We're hearing from one of

10:38.080 --> 10:39.832
our producers
there on the ground

10:39.920 --> 10:43.754
that it was this large bang
on one side of the street.

10:43.840 --> 10:45.096
What are they trying to do?

10:45.120 --> 10:46.296
- Erin, are you okay?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

10:46.320 --> 10:48.276
- Where are you?
- Just a bar.

10:48.360 --> 10:49.976
- I don't know...
- How are you gettin' home?

10:50.000 --> 10:51.877
I dunno.
My stuff is all back...

10:51.960 --> 10:52.960
Thank God you're okay.

10:53.040 --> 10:54.656
Yeah. At the buses.
It's back at the buses.

10:54.680 --> 10:55.896
How are you gonna get
your car keys?

10:55.920 --> 10:58.000
I dunno.
I don't know how to get there.

10:58.080 --> 10:59.877
Stay where you are.
I'll come find you.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.188
Yeah.

11:01.280 --> 11:02.776
At least five, six people hurt.

11:02.800 --> 11:04.358
Where can I meet you?

11:04.440 --> 11:05.536
But I have a feeling
there are more.

11:05.560 --> 11:06.754
Where can I meet you?

11:06.840 --> 11:08.640
The photos, injuries to those

11:08.720 --> 11:10.597
in the blast area
are quite severe.

11:10.680 --> 11:13.069
Just a tragic scene here
in Boston today.

11:13.160 --> 11:14.160
Oh, my God.

11:33.800 --> 11:34.869
Yeah, hello.

11:36.560 --> 11:38.152
It's Patty, yeah.

11:50.520 --> 11:52.896
And you know they
would've told you if he was dead, right?

11:52.920 --> 11:54.831
How do you even know that,
Karen?

11:54.920 --> 11:56.816
You know I spent my fair
share of time in a goddamn hospital.

11:56.840 --> 11:57.936
Well, this ain't about you!

11:57.960 --> 11:59.188
Didn't say it was! Jesus!

11:59.320 --> 12:00.320
Will you two stop?

12:00.400 --> 12:01.913
They're gonna be
calling our name.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.176
You can't right now,
you can't.

12:03.200 --> 12:04.838
Where's my son, God damn it?

12:04.920 --> 12:06.776
- What the hell happened?
- Oh, Jesus Christ!

12:06.800 --> 12:09.439
Where is he? Patty?
What's goin' on with my son?

12:09.520 --> 12:11.720
- Calm down.
- Don't tell me what to do, Bob!

12:12.880 --> 12:14.711
Patty, what's going on
with my son?

12:14.800 --> 12:16.279
We don't know yet.

12:16.360 --> 12:17.656
- Bauman family?
- Yes!

12:17.680 --> 12:19.557
- Bauman!
- Yeah, we're with...

12:19.640 --> 12:21.073
We're with Jeff Bauman.

12:21.160 --> 12:23.720
Right here. We're his family.

12:31.400 --> 12:32.496
Mr. and Mrs. Bauman?

12:32.520 --> 12:33.520
- Yeah.
- Mmm. Yes.

12:33.600 --> 12:34.919
I'm Dr. Kalish.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.911
Jeff's alive.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.514
- Your son's alive.
- Yeah. All right.

12:39.600 --> 12:41.397
Thank you, thank you.

12:41.480 --> 12:46.190
So, Jeff came in bleeding
with tourniquets on both legs,

12:46.280 --> 12:49.158
and he was intubated
right away

12:49.240 --> 12:50.753
and then
brought up immediately

12:50.840 --> 12:52.114
to the operating room...

12:53.040 --> 12:55.395
- Hi.
- I'm looking for Jeff Bauman.

12:55.480 --> 12:56.776
Um, you're gonna
have to sign in here.

12:56.800 --> 12:58.056
Put his name here
and we'll find out where he is.

12:58.080 --> 12:59.696
Um, can you tell me if
he's at this hospital, please?

12:59.720 --> 13:00.800
I... I can't tell you.

13:00.880 --> 13:02.376
I saw a picture.
I know he's at a hospital.

13:02.400 --> 13:03.456
I just don't know which one.

13:03.480 --> 13:05.256
Will you please just
tell me what floor he's on?

13:05.280 --> 13:07.236
It's crazy right now.
I will help you.

13:07.960 --> 13:10.838
Jeff underwent a double
above-the-knee amputation.

13:10.920 --> 13:12.736
Most of the destruction
had actually already been done

13:12.760 --> 13:15.149
by the bomb below the knees,

13:15.240 --> 13:18.596
and it was very obvious
to all the surgeons involved

13:18.680 --> 13:20.477
that there was no way
to salvage anything

13:20.560 --> 13:22.516
below the knee.

13:22.600 --> 13:26.275
We had to get higher than
the knee to get clean skin,

13:26.360 --> 13:28.555
clean muscle, clean tissue.

14:45.920 --> 14:47.638
Oh, my God.

15:11.280 --> 15:14.078
I gotta get
something to drink.

15:14.160 --> 15:15.991
Um, do you want me
to get you a Coke,

15:16.080 --> 15:17.798
or chips, or something?

15:42.760 --> 15:44.736
Well, as they look through all these

15:44.760 --> 15:46.336
little pieces, Brian,
they think the bomb now

15:46.360 --> 15:48.032
was made
by putting the components

15:48.120 --> 15:50.156
inside a pressure cooker pot.

15:50.240 --> 15:53.789
And in there were nails,
BBs, and ball bearings

15:53.880 --> 15:56.030
to magnify the destructive

15:56.120 --> 15:58.680
and injury-causing nature
of the blast.

15:58.760 --> 16:01.115
And the explosive
was gunpowder.

16:02.720 --> 16:06.554
Uh, the blast wounded
more than 140 people...

16:17.720 --> 16:19.039
Some guy asked me

16:19.120 --> 16:21.759
if my son is still unconscious
while I'm takin' a leak,

16:21.840 --> 16:23.034
and I'm supposed to know

16:23.120 --> 16:24.519
this freak
is a fuckin' reporter?

16:24.600 --> 16:26.296
It ain't suspicious to ya?
A stranger chattin' it up

16:26.320 --> 16:27.760
while you got your dick
in your hand?

16:27.840 --> 16:29.114
Jenny, I was washin' my hands.

16:29.200 --> 16:30.936
Shut the fuck up!
You're fucking yelling about Jeff!

16:30.960 --> 16:31.960
Ah, Jesus...

16:32.040 --> 16:34.736
- Stop talking about her son!
- He's my son, too.

16:34.760 --> 16:35.856
- It's hers.
- Shut up.

16:35.880 --> 16:37.074
What do you want?

16:37.160 --> 16:38.673
I'm so sorry to intrude.

16:38.760 --> 16:39.896
You're another reporter, aren't you?

16:39.920 --> 16:41.148
Don't let him in, Jeff.

16:41.240 --> 16:43.071
I'm sorry, I'm, um,
looking for Patty Joyce.

16:43.160 --> 16:44.275
I'm Patty.

16:44.360 --> 16:45.560
Did you not hear us?

16:45.640 --> 16:47.176
- I'm Kevin Horst. Uh...
- Who?

16:47.200 --> 16:49.555
I'm Jeff's manager at Costco.

16:49.640 --> 16:50.640
Check his ID.

16:50.720 --> 16:52.153
These reporters
will try everything.

16:52.280 --> 16:54.555
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You... You called, right?

16:54.640 --> 16:56.915
Yeah, Jeff talks about ya.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.116
Well, ya heard
what happened, huh?

16:59.200 --> 17:00.713
Yeah.

17:02.280 --> 17:04.669
You know our son
lost his legs, right?

17:04.760 --> 17:07.672
- I know.
- And you brought breakfast?

17:07.760 --> 17:09.215
- That's not helpful.
- Uh, thank you very much.

17:09.240 --> 17:10.576
Maybe we should
wait to eat 'em

17:10.599 --> 17:11.828
so you can go
grab your camera.

17:11.920 --> 17:13.536
Take a picture
for your Costco newsletter.

17:13.560 --> 17:15.949
I'm... Really, I'm happy
to bring whatever you like.

17:16.040 --> 17:18.016
What could you possibly
get us that we need right now, Kevin?

17:18.040 --> 17:20.429
Well, I took the liberty
of printing up...

17:20.560 --> 17:22.175
A fucking joke.
You kiddin' me?

17:22.200 --> 17:25.192
...his policy,
and I've highlighted the areas

17:25.280 --> 17:26.473
that you'll need to sign.

17:26.560 --> 17:28.790
Don't sign nothin'
without a goddamn lawyer!

17:28.880 --> 17:30.256
Can you just let him talk
for a second?

17:30.280 --> 17:31.360
Who are you again?

17:31.400 --> 17:32.456
Yeah, shut the fuck up
and let him talk.

17:32.480 --> 17:33.776
What's he gonna say
that we need to hear right now?

17:33.800 --> 17:34.915
I don't know.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.355
Okay, answer me this.
Answer me this.

17:37.440 --> 17:40.398
My son makes it through this,
where's he gonna work, Kevin?

17:41.480 --> 17:42.549
Where's he gonna work?

17:42.640 --> 17:45.029
Hmm? You gonna hire him back?

17:45.120 --> 17:47.111
Jesus Christ.
We need this right now?

17:47.200 --> 17:49.077
Yes, we do!

17:49.160 --> 17:52.038
Who's gonna hire him
without any legs, Patty?

17:52.120 --> 17:53.758
We can't rehire him, sir.

17:53.840 --> 17:54.909
See? I told ya.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.256
Mr. Bauman, please,
let me finish.

17:56.280 --> 17:57.349
We can't rehire him,

17:57.440 --> 17:59.795
'cause he'll never have
stopped working for us.

18:00.840 --> 18:03.673
We're not letting Jeff go.

18:03.760 --> 18:06.718
And these... This is stupid.
But this is just...

18:06.800 --> 18:09.234
You know, this is just
to get the insurance goin'

18:09.320 --> 18:10.753
and get that rollin'.

18:10.840 --> 18:11.955
Wait, insurance?

18:12.040 --> 18:13.758
Yes.

18:13.840 --> 18:15.353
Jeffrey has insurance?

18:15.440 --> 18:17.715
Of course, of course. Um...

18:17.800 --> 18:22.874
Plus legal, mental health,
or financial advice

18:22.960 --> 18:26.236
for Jeff or any member
of the family.

18:26.320 --> 18:29.596
And I've included
my personal cell...

18:31.440 --> 18:33.317
...at the top there. Um...

18:33.400 --> 18:35.197
All right, good.

18:35.280 --> 18:39.193
That's good. I'm glad you guys
are doin' the right thing.

18:39.280 --> 18:41.874
So, what kinda
muffins we got there?

19:19.440 --> 19:21.056
All of those things happened

19:21.080 --> 19:22.433
in preparation for this event.

19:22.520 --> 19:23.976
But there was
no specific intelligence

19:24.000 --> 19:25.216
that anything
was going to happen.

19:25.240 --> 19:26.376
At this point in time,
it's too early

19:26.400 --> 19:27.515
to get into the specifics.

19:27.600 --> 19:28.874
These were powerful devices

19:28.960 --> 19:30.916
that resulted
in serious injuries.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.309
Do you have
someone in custody?

19:33.440 --> 19:35.510
Those reports are not true.

19:35.600 --> 19:37.158
There is no suspect
in custody.

19:37.280 --> 19:38.759
We're questioning many people,

19:38.840 --> 19:41.479
but there is no one in custody
at this point in time.

19:45.840 --> 19:47.432
Jeff?

19:47.520 --> 19:49.715
Holy shit. Are you awake, bro?

19:51.600 --> 19:53.033
You hear me?

19:54.600 --> 19:57.319
Okay. Okay, okay.

19:59.200 --> 20:03.478
Uh, so I gotta tell ya,
there was an explosion.

20:05.680 --> 20:07.591
And your fuckin' legs...

20:09.000 --> 20:10.513
They're gone, bro.

20:25.480 --> 20:26.993
What are you doin', buddy?

20:27.120 --> 20:30.192
I can't tell what
your fingers are doin'.

20:30.280 --> 20:31.793
What, you wanna
write somethin'?

20:33.000 --> 20:34.194
Hold on.

20:38.720 --> 20:40.597
Here, buddy, here.
Here's a pen.

20:40.680 --> 20:42.238
Yeah, grab that.

20:48.800 --> 20:50.656
Erin? Erin, yeah, she's fine,
she's here. She's...

20:50.680 --> 20:54.150
The whole family's here.
Everyone's down the hall.

20:54.240 --> 20:56.754
You okay? How you feelin'?

21:05.360 --> 21:06.554
"Lieutenant Dan"?

21:10.560 --> 21:13.438
You mean the guy from
"Forrest Gump" with no legs?

21:32.880 --> 21:34.677
Oh, shit. Don't move.

21:38.560 --> 21:39.595
Bob, Bob, wake up!

21:39.680 --> 21:40.954
What the hell, D?

21:41.040 --> 21:42.314
- Jeff's awake.
- Huh?

21:42.400 --> 21:43.833
He wrote this.

21:43.920 --> 21:46.753
- The last part.
- Holy shit.

21:46.840 --> 21:49.752
- What happened? D?
- He's awake.

21:49.840 --> 21:51.990
- Where's the FBI office?
- Bob.

21:52.120 --> 21:54.315
- Hey!
- Bob.

21:54.400 --> 21:55.656
- Hey!
- Bob.

21:55.680 --> 21:58.240
Hey!

21:58.320 --> 21:59.776
Jeffie.

21:59.800 --> 22:01.520
Cut it down, guys.
'Cause he just... just...

22:01.560 --> 22:03.312
Jeffrey? Hey, baby.

22:03.400 --> 22:06.790
Oh, my God, we are so happy
you're back with us.

22:06.880 --> 22:08.313
Um, uh, now listen,

22:08.400 --> 22:12.075
some of the FBI guys
are gonna come in.

22:12.160 --> 22:16.278
They're gonna ask ya, you know, a...
a few questions.

22:16.360 --> 22:17.998
So... Okay?

22:18.080 --> 22:21.516
And all ya gotta do
is just tell 'em what ya saw.

22:21.600 --> 22:22.749
That's great.

22:22.840 --> 22:24.016
We're removing
the intubation tube.

22:24.040 --> 22:25.314
We need everyone to clear out.

22:25.400 --> 22:26.799
But we just got...

22:26.880 --> 22:28.279
We'll be back.

22:28.360 --> 22:29.736
We're just getting ready
to take the breathing tube out.

22:29.760 --> 22:31.751
- It'll be okay.
- See ya later.

22:31.840 --> 22:33.656
- It'll be okay.
- Let's go. Let's go.

22:33.680 --> 22:35.511
We gotta get
that tube out, okay?

22:37.360 --> 22:39.316
You ready, buddy?

22:39.400 --> 22:42.358
What's wrong, bud?
You want her?

22:42.440 --> 22:44.635
Yeah. I'mma let her stay.
It's okay.

22:44.720 --> 22:46.836
It's okay.
You're all right, buddy.

22:46.920 --> 22:48.353
Relax, okay?

22:48.440 --> 22:49.776
All right, we have
a couple minutes of hubbub

22:49.800 --> 22:51.392
before we get the tube out.

22:51.480 --> 22:53.056
Open your mouth. We just gonna
clean your mouth first.

22:53.080 --> 22:54.798
Then we're gonna get
that tube out.

22:54.880 --> 22:58.031
Relax. Let me just take off
some tape. Perfect.

22:58.120 --> 22:59.838
- Slow breaths.
- We have a cuff link.

22:59.920 --> 23:02.036
Here we go, bud. Ready?

23:02.120 --> 23:03.997
One, two, three.
Take a big breath.

23:05.200 --> 23:07.316
Big breath, big breath.
Big breath.

23:07.400 --> 23:08.520
Take a big breath.

23:10.720 --> 23:13.280
Okay. Relax, relax.

23:13.360 --> 23:16.670
Slow breaths. She's just gonna
suction your mouth again.

23:16.760 --> 23:18.159
Slow breaths, bud.

23:18.240 --> 23:19.389
Good job. Can you say "Hi"?

23:19.480 --> 23:20.674
Hi.

23:22.360 --> 23:24.555
Okay, good job, good job.

23:24.640 --> 23:25.816
We're gonna put
this mask on.

23:25.840 --> 23:27.000
Put that on. Relax.

23:27.040 --> 23:28.632
All right.
You can talk to him,

23:28.760 --> 23:30.079
but he can't answer you, okay?

23:30.160 --> 23:31.957
- Okay.
- Yes and no.

23:32.920 --> 23:34.797
Okay? All right, buddy.

23:34.880 --> 23:37.713
- Great job, great job.
- Good to go, kid.

23:43.240 --> 23:44.832
- Hey, E.
- Mm?

23:45.920 --> 23:47.638
You're sittin' on my leg.

23:49.520 --> 23:51.033
Oh.

23:57.760 --> 23:59.478
- Hi.
- Hi.

24:03.640 --> 24:05.039
No talking. No talking.

24:06.760 --> 24:07.909
I'm a tough guy.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.149
No talking.

24:10.360 --> 24:11.998
I know you're tough.

24:14.480 --> 24:16.869
Is he in there tellin' 'em
about the bomber?

24:16.960 --> 24:18.279
Yeah, I think so.

24:20.840 --> 24:24.150
Fuckin' miracle.
My boy. Fuckin' hero.

24:25.200 --> 24:26.394
You bet.

24:26.480 --> 24:27.760
Sorta the same
kinda build,

24:27.840 --> 24:30.308
but, like,
maybe a little taller.

24:30.400 --> 24:32.960
But I looked him
right in the eyes,

24:33.040 --> 24:34.553
so he's the same...

24:34.640 --> 24:36.437
Was he young or old?

24:37.840 --> 24:39.432
Young... he was young.

24:42.880 --> 24:44.711
Yeah.

24:44.800 --> 24:46.560
What do you remember
after the blast?

24:48.760 --> 24:50.113
Uh...

24:55.240 --> 24:56.992
There was, like, this smell.

24:58.680 --> 25:00.352
Like, it smelled like...

25:02.200 --> 25:04.191
Take your time.

25:05.520 --> 25:07.397
Like the Fourth of July.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.160
...is now, in fact, we know, dead.

25:15.200 --> 25:16.816
All right, Dr. Schoenfeld,
thank you so much for joining us.

25:16.840 --> 25:17.989
We really appreciate it.

25:18.120 --> 25:20.315
Obviously, Dr. Schoenfeld,
limited by what he can say

25:20.400 --> 25:22.152
because of the situation,
obviously,

25:22.240 --> 25:24.674
this huge manhunt
being watched worldwide.

25:24.760 --> 25:27.354
An individual,
Suspect Number 1,

25:27.440 --> 25:29.158
uh, now dead, we know.

25:29.240 --> 25:31.037
Fuckin' A!

25:31.120 --> 25:33.076
- Oh, my God!
- You son of a bitch!

25:34.480 --> 25:36.914
Fuckin' kill
that other son of a bitch, too!

26:06.760 --> 26:10.196
Jeffrey, I just met Carlos.

26:12.240 --> 26:14.117
He's the guy
who saved your life.

26:28.640 --> 26:30.551
Would you like a coffee?

26:30.640 --> 26:32.870
I brought some...
I've got some... got some coffees.

26:36.520 --> 26:38.476
Don't know what
I'm supposed to do.

26:42.680 --> 26:44.511
I think everyone
in that hospital

26:44.600 --> 26:46.477
is thinking that same thing.

26:47.560 --> 26:48.595
Yeah.

26:53.040 --> 26:55.315
We broke up about a month ago,
me and Jeff.

26:59.200 --> 27:02.397
It's not the first time...
we usually get back together.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.433
Not this time?

27:10.200 --> 27:12.430
Doesn't show up
for anything.

27:12.520 --> 27:14.636
He's always late.

27:14.720 --> 27:17.792
You know, he... he never wants
to leave his apartment.

27:17.880 --> 27:19.472
I'm just fed up with it.

27:21.800 --> 27:23.552
And then he shows up.

27:38.120 --> 27:40.793
Sounded like
multiple assault rifle shots to me.

27:40.880 --> 27:43.314
8:15 p.m.,
a person is cornered

27:43.400 --> 27:45.311
on a boat in a yard
in Watertown.

27:45.400 --> 27:46.936
A suspect in the boat.

27:46.960 --> 27:48.016
Hundreds of law enforcement...

27:48.040 --> 27:49.598
- Hi.
- Hi.

27:49.680 --> 27:50.856
Jeff, how you doin'?

27:50.880 --> 27:52.560
So, Jeff, we have to do

27:52.600 --> 27:53.953
the first dressing change today.

27:54.040 --> 27:55.792
Okay, we're gonna take
these bandages off.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.592
I'm not looking.

27:59.680 --> 28:01.016
Things get too rough,
please let us know

28:01.040 --> 28:02.996
and we can figure out
how to help you.

28:03.080 --> 28:04.593
I'm sorry?

28:04.680 --> 28:05.976
And did you
already pre-medicate him

28:06.000 --> 28:07.416
- for the dressing change?
- Yep.

28:07.440 --> 28:10.830
He's already gotten his oxy
and his dilaudid PO.

28:10.920 --> 28:12.990
He has a PR in fentanyl
for breakthrough.

28:13.080 --> 28:14.513
And I have plenty
in my pocket.

28:14.600 --> 28:15.976
Now some people like to look.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.376
Some people
don't like to look at all.

28:17.400 --> 28:19.356
No. I don't wanna
look at me now.

28:19.440 --> 28:22.034
So, Marion, if you
can hold up the right leg...

28:22.120 --> 28:23.416
- Okay.
- ...that would be very helpful,

28:23.440 --> 28:25.715
and we'll unwrap 'em now.

28:25.800 --> 28:27.995
All righty.
I'm gonna just lift ya up.

28:28.080 --> 28:29.136
You're gonna feel my hands.

28:29.160 --> 28:30.309
I'm sorry, hon.

28:33.280 --> 28:34.736
So I'm just taking the tape off,

28:34.760 --> 28:37.399
and I'm gonna unwrap
the Ace bandage first.

28:37.480 --> 28:39.311
This shouldn't be too bad.

28:39.400 --> 28:42.233
But if you have
any sharp pains or anything,

28:42.320 --> 28:44.834
please let me know.

28:44.920 --> 28:46.296
All right,
you're gonna feel my hands.

28:46.320 --> 28:48.880
Tell me if you're ready.
Did that kick in yet?

28:48.960 --> 28:50.632
- Doing okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

28:50.720 --> 28:52.119
All right.

28:54.480 --> 28:56.198
Almost done with the gauze.

28:57.720 --> 28:59.392
Fuck.

28:59.480 --> 29:00.549
You okay?

29:00.640 --> 29:02.915
Yeah.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.230
You let us know
if you need a break, okay?

29:07.840 --> 29:09.319
You're okay.

29:09.400 --> 29:10.753
Don't look at 'em.

29:10.840 --> 29:11.989
I'm not lookin' at 'em.

29:12.080 --> 29:13.216
Okay, now
this might be a little sticky.

29:13.240 --> 29:14.514
- Looking at you.
- God!

29:14.600 --> 29:15.896
Doin' great. Doin' great.

29:15.920 --> 29:18.070
You're doin' awesome.

29:18.160 --> 29:20.799
Okay, the dressing's off.
We'll give you a minute.

29:22.160 --> 29:24.276
- Nice little breaths.
- Good job.

29:24.360 --> 29:26.271
In your nose,
out your mouth.

29:26.360 --> 29:27.576
You're doing so great.

29:27.600 --> 29:28.919
That was the worst.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.520
Getting the dressings off
is the worst.

29:37.480 --> 29:39.232
Want a little more fentanyl?

29:40.000 --> 29:41.592
Okay.

29:41.680 --> 29:43.159
'Cause now we're gonna

29:43.240 --> 29:44.296
take off the dressing
on the left side, okay?

29:44.320 --> 29:45.594
Yeah.

29:45.720 --> 29:46.896
You mind going
over there, Marion?

29:46.920 --> 29:48.176
We're just gonna set up.
We're not touching anything yet.

29:48.200 --> 29:49.633
We're just settin' up.

29:49.720 --> 29:51.597
Just gonna shimmy
this down a little.

29:51.680 --> 29:53.079
Okay.

29:53.160 --> 29:54.616
All right, I'm gonna lift up,
one, two, three.

29:54.640 --> 29:55.776
You're gonna feel this again.

29:55.800 --> 29:57.200
Pretty much
just like the other one.

29:59.680 --> 30:01.636
- Sorry, hon.
- Okay.

30:01.720 --> 30:03.016
Do you want...
I have the fentanyl in my pocket.

30:03.040 --> 30:04.096
Do you want me
to give you that?

30:04.120 --> 30:05.872
Yeah, yeah.
Let's give that to him.

30:05.960 --> 30:07.536
All right, we're gonna take a break.

30:07.560 --> 30:08.816
We'll give you
some more medicine.

30:08.840 --> 30:10.016
Okay, let me just get to...

30:10.040 --> 30:11.240
I'm just gonna
work around you,

30:11.320 --> 30:12.594
so I'm just gonna
get to my IV.

30:12.680 --> 30:13.874
We're almost done.

30:13.960 --> 30:15.296
Now, same thing,
dried blood, big pull.

30:15.320 --> 30:16.696
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

30:16.720 --> 30:19.871
That's it, that's it.

30:19.960 --> 30:21.279
Right here.

30:30.240 --> 30:31.275
Hey.

30:34.760 --> 30:35.829
Hey.

30:37.080 --> 30:38.195
Was I asleep?

30:39.600 --> 30:41.238
Yeah.

30:41.360 --> 30:42.839
A good two hours.

30:51.880 --> 30:53.950
You need a haircut.

30:54.080 --> 30:55.559
- No shit.
- Mmm-hmm.

30:57.440 --> 30:59.192
You need to wash it.

30:59.280 --> 31:00.633
- No.
- Yes.

31:01.760 --> 31:03.273
- No.
- Yes.

31:03.360 --> 31:04.998
Still smells like...

31:13.600 --> 31:16.717
You should have seen
the sign I made for ya.

31:18.720 --> 31:19.869
What'd it say?

31:23.280 --> 31:26.078
Had, like, 3D letters
and everything.

31:28.480 --> 31:30.198
Hey.

31:30.280 --> 31:32.919
I'm sorry.

31:35.440 --> 31:37.112
I'm sorry.

31:39.640 --> 31:41.232
Don't say that.

31:41.320 --> 31:43.959
- I'm so sorry.
- Hey.

31:46.080 --> 31:47.433
Don't say that.

31:59.520 --> 32:01.476
You don't owe me anything.

32:09.040 --> 32:10.917
Yes! Yes!

32:18.520 --> 32:19.794
What's that?

32:23.200 --> 32:24.474
I don't know.

32:28.880 --> 32:30.836
Maybe they caught
the other guy.

32:36.120 --> 32:38.156
Bye, Jeff.
We're so proud of you.

32:41.120 --> 32:42.456
...hours ago

32:42.480 --> 32:44.630
now seems to be finally over.

32:44.720 --> 32:46.711
The last suspect
being searched for, police...

32:46.800 --> 32:48.438
According to
Boston Police Department...

33:15.760 --> 33:17.637
It's nice
they turned out for ya.

33:17.720 --> 33:19.790
I think... I think he wants
to do it himself.

33:19.880 --> 33:20.949
Yeah, okay.

33:21.040 --> 33:22.736
I'm gonna lock you off, honey.
I'll lock you off.

33:22.760 --> 33:24.079
Hold on. Okay.

33:25.080 --> 33:26.296
You just let me know
if you wanna...

33:26.320 --> 33:28.151
Thanks, Kevin. Thanks.

33:28.240 --> 33:29.776
Take a picture with Erin for us.

33:29.800 --> 33:32.155
Does it feel good to be going home?

33:32.280 --> 33:35.238
Is Carlos Arrendondo your guardian angel?

33:35.320 --> 33:36.878
They hated each other,

33:36.960 --> 33:39.269
and that's why
Pete got busted for it.

33:39.360 --> 33:41.191
'Cause Bob was using
his computer.

33:41.280 --> 33:43.111
And Pete didn't rat him out.

33:43.200 --> 33:45.191
And he... he almost
had to go to jail for that.

33:45.280 --> 33:46.633
It was in the papers
and all that.

33:46.720 --> 33:48.472
- Hey, listen, look at this.
- Hey.

33:48.560 --> 33:50.232
Ain 't that somethin '?

33:50.320 --> 33:51.376
- Oh, my...
- Both sides.

33:51.400 --> 33:52.515
"Boston Strong."

33:52.600 --> 33:53.600
Let... we gotta wave.

33:53.680 --> 33:55.318
- What does that even mean?
- Wave.

33:55.400 --> 33:57.320
You're a national fuckin' hero, kiddo.

33:57.400 --> 33:58.435
You wave, Jeff.

33:59.640 --> 34:01.232
They're all out for ya.

34:01.320 --> 34:02.673
You're a real hero.

34:02.760 --> 34:04.159
Isn't that somethin'?

34:04.240 --> 34:05.559
And it's just the start.

34:05.640 --> 34:06.816
That's really somethin'.

34:06.840 --> 34:08.478
I'm a hero for standin ' there

34:08.560 --> 34:11.279
and getting my legs blown off?

34:11.400 --> 34:12.936
Yeah, what are ya talkin' about?

34:12.960 --> 34:14.775
That's the HOV
for electric vehicles and whatnot.

34:14.800 --> 34:17.313
No, like, for, uh...
it's just for handicap cars.

34:17.400 --> 34:19.789
No, no, there's no
handicap drivin' lane.

34:19.880 --> 34:21.791
Jesus, what a bunch of morons.

34:21.880 --> 34:23.255
Okay, we're fuckin' morons,

34:23.280 --> 34:24.896
'cause we care about
people with disabilities?

34:24.920 --> 34:26.176
Ooh, ooh, Jeff, Jeff! He's here.

34:26.199 --> 34:27.315
Fuck you.

34:27.400 --> 34:28.496
- All right, let's do this.
- Yes!

34:28.520 --> 34:30.476
Come on.
Look out.

34:30.560 --> 34:31.560
Hey.

34:33.239 --> 34:35.514
I got this back there.

34:35.600 --> 34:37.237
Oh, shit, don't pull it.

34:39.400 --> 34:41.038
Okay, got it, buddy?

34:41.120 --> 34:43.350
Got the back?
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

34:45.199 --> 34:46.936
Patty, I still think
Jeffie could live with me.

34:46.960 --> 34:49.757
Oh, yeah, all the way
up there in Cow-Hampshire.

34:49.840 --> 34:51.199
All his friends are here,
ya idiot.

34:51.239 --> 34:53.456
All due respect,
I got more room than all of yas.

34:53.480 --> 34:55.789
And I'm the only one
with a credit score above 520.

34:55.880 --> 34:57.056
I'm the one got a pool.

34:57.080 --> 34:58.593
Above fucking ground!

35:02.320 --> 35:03.496
Oh, careful, careful.

35:03.520 --> 35:05.590
Oh, ow, ow.

35:05.680 --> 35:07.079
For God's sakes!

35:07.160 --> 35:09.720
Jesus! My shin splints.

35:09.800 --> 35:11.074
God. You're gonna have to get

35:11.160 --> 35:12.496
a place with a ramp
or an elevator.

35:12.520 --> 35:14.590
We're all gonna end up
in a fuckin' wheelchair.

35:14.680 --> 35:16.398
Not a tingle in your leg...

35:16.480 --> 35:18.550
He's home!
That's all that matters.

35:18.640 --> 35:20.296
- God, I got a lot to do and...
- So psyched.

35:20.320 --> 35:21.958
God.

35:22.040 --> 35:23.776
Oh, my God, I thought it was
gonna be better than this.

35:23.800 --> 35:25.296
- Yeah, look at this, huh?
- Where's Jeffie?

35:25.320 --> 35:26.616
- Oh, Jeff. You okay?
- Hey, there he is.

35:26.640 --> 35:27.789
All right. This is it.

35:27.880 --> 35:29.108
This is it. Welcome home!

35:29.200 --> 35:30.838
Is it good to be back?

35:30.920 --> 35:33.388
Oh, my God, it's a little
crazy at the moment,

35:33.480 --> 35:36.153
because people, you know,
they send you these...

35:36.240 --> 35:38.390
- This stuff...
- It's, uh, every day.

35:38.480 --> 35:40.056
- It's, like, packages.
- From all over the world!

35:40.080 --> 35:41.911
Packages all over the place.

35:42.000 --> 35:45.390
Ya gonna have to look at some
of these, son, at some point.

35:45.480 --> 35:47.198
That and toys and packages.

35:47.280 --> 35:49.077
What was that place?
Micro-somethin'.

35:49.160 --> 35:50.479
Uh, yeah, yeah.

35:50.560 --> 35:51.788
Oh, Micronesia or somethin'.

35:51.920 --> 35:52.920
Yeah.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.558
Swear to God, it's true.

35:54.640 --> 35:57.950
Yeah, stuff...
Stuff comes for ya from... Oh, my God.

35:58.040 --> 35:59.871
I dunno. I dunno.

35:59.960 --> 36:01.951
You, shut up.
You just shut up.

36:02.040 --> 36:03.155
Ma.

36:03.240 --> 36:04.536
We're gonna have a party now.
I'm gonna get ya a beer.

36:04.560 --> 36:06.016
- Thank you.
- I'll get ya a beer, right?

36:06.040 --> 36:07.176
Oh, can he drink yet?

36:07.200 --> 36:09.320
'Course he can drink.
Didn't cut his balls off.

36:10.240 --> 36:12.708
It's cute.

36:12.800 --> 36:14.950
The whole world's
watchin' ya, kid.

36:15.040 --> 36:17.713
Yeah, you're like a symbol
to a lot of people.

36:17.800 --> 36:18.835
For what?

36:18.920 --> 36:20.433
Ya know,
you're Boston Strong, right?

36:20.520 --> 36:21.816
- Huh?
- We're proud of you, Jeff.

36:21.840 --> 36:23.796
I'll have
one of them beers, Patty.

36:40.080 --> 36:41.433
E.

36:42.760 --> 36:43.988
Can you help...

36:44.080 --> 36:45.136
Can you give me
a hand for a second?

36:45.160 --> 36:46.275
Yeah.

36:47.320 --> 36:49.595
What do you need?

36:49.680 --> 36:51.318
Uh, to the, uh, bathroom.

36:51.400 --> 36:53.470
- Gotta go to the bathroom.
- Yeah.

37:03.520 --> 37:04.794
Some pizza, Bob?

37:04.880 --> 37:06.677
I'd love a piece,
Big Jeff, thank you.

37:06.760 --> 37:07.896
All right.
You gonna come get it

37:07.920 --> 37:09.320
or you'd like me
to serve it to you?

37:09.400 --> 37:10.896
I'd like you to serve it to me.

37:10.920 --> 37:12.672
- Do you need the chair?
- No.

37:13.880 --> 37:15.154
I got it.

37:35.840 --> 37:38.638
- You okay?
- Yeah. I think.

37:52.960 --> 37:54.791
Take off my...
Yeah.

37:57.800 --> 37:59.756
Careful of your bandages.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.319
I got it, I got it.

38:08.400 --> 38:11.278
I'm good. I'm good, I'm good.

38:11.360 --> 38:13.032
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

38:14.520 --> 38:15.669
You wanna close that?

38:16.720 --> 38:18.278
Do you want me to close it?

38:19.280 --> 38:20.349
Yup.

38:34.120 --> 38:35.838
You can just
hand me your stuff.

38:35.920 --> 38:37.148
What?

38:37.240 --> 38:38.560
You can just
hand me your clothes.

38:54.480 --> 38:56.198
Here.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.592
You can go, Erin.

39:12.640 --> 39:14.312
You sure?

39:22.320 --> 39:23.958
Call me
if you need me, okay?

39:51.040 --> 39:52.473
I don't need a doctor.

39:52.560 --> 39:54.471
Oh, shut the fuck up, Bob.

40:17.240 --> 40:19.117
What time is it?

40:19.200 --> 40:21.216
You know what time it is,
and we have to be going.

40:24.720 --> 40:25.835
Jeffrey?

40:25.920 --> 40:28.070
Jeffrey, good morning.

40:29.440 --> 40:30.839
Jeffrey, are you awake?

40:32.240 --> 40:34.037
Gonna be late for rehab.

40:37.200 --> 40:38.872
Come on.

40:39.920 --> 40:42.275
No, I'm up. No, I'm up, Ma.

40:42.360 --> 40:45.750
Oh. Okay. All right.
I think he's...

40:45.880 --> 40:48.155
I got my coat.
I... I'm wearing my coat.

40:48.240 --> 40:49.355
This is what I'm wearing.

40:54.200 --> 40:55.256
What the hell was that?

40:57.080 --> 40:58.274
Fuck.

40:58.360 --> 41:00.191
Jeffrey?

41:00.280 --> 41:02.032
Sweetie, Jeffrey,
are you okay?

41:03.960 --> 41:05.518
- I hear it.
- Shh!

41:06.840 --> 41:08.910
Jeffrey! Just tell me
you're okay, baby.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.256
I don't know what he's doing.

41:10.280 --> 41:11.713
What do you think is going on?

41:11.800 --> 41:13.056
Jesus, Patty, what do you
think boys do in their room

41:13.080 --> 41:14.798
when they lock their door?

41:14.880 --> 41:16.736
- Yeah, I think he's doin' it.
- You think he...

41:16.760 --> 41:18.671
The kid's got no legs,
and he's blowin' loads.

41:18.760 --> 41:20.600
Dirty fucking...

41:21.360 --> 41:22.429
Jeffrey?

41:25.360 --> 41:26.760
It's gonna be very special, Jeffie.

41:27.880 --> 41:30.394
Everybody wants to see ya.

41:30.480 --> 41:32.471
See how good you're doin'.

41:32.560 --> 41:33.600
I just wish you would have

41:33.720 --> 41:34.976
let somebody
cut your freakin' hair.

41:35.000 --> 41:36.136
Oh, stop pickin' on him.

41:36.160 --> 41:37.896
It's gonna be good.

41:37.920 --> 41:40.195
Hello.

41:40.280 --> 41:42.350
Hi. He's doin' good.

41:42.440 --> 41:44.556
He has an appointment. So...

41:44.640 --> 41:47.200
I'm his Aunt Jenn.
I'm here for support.

41:47.280 --> 41:48.576
After the bomb blast

41:48.600 --> 41:50.830
at the Boston Marathon
took most of his legs,

41:50.920 --> 41:52.751
28-year-old
Chelmsford resident

41:52.840 --> 41:54.876
Jeff Bauman
is lucky to be alive,

41:54.960 --> 41:57.474
but his real struggle
has just begun.

41:57.560 --> 42:00.677
Bauman told reporters
that he will one day walk again.

42:00.760 --> 42:02.113
After multiple surgeries

42:02.200 --> 42:04.316
and endless
painful rehabilitation,

42:04.400 --> 42:05.879
many people would give up.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.456
- Erin, come here!
- But with the support

42:07.480 --> 42:09.280
- of his family and friends...
- Jeff's on TV!

42:09.360 --> 42:10.918
- My Jeff?
- Come here.

42:11.000 --> 42:12.399
...supporters
all over the world.

42:12.480 --> 42:14.000
Jeff Bauman
has found something amazing

42:14.040 --> 42:16.315
here at Spaulding Hospital.

42:16.400 --> 42:18.470
That something is called hope.

42:18.560 --> 42:20.471
In the days following
the Marathon bombing,

42:20.600 --> 42:23.990
this photograph showed the carnage
at the finish line.

42:24.080 --> 42:26.150
Jeff Bauman was standing
next to one of the bombs

42:26.240 --> 42:29.391
when it detonated,
obliterating his legs.

42:29.480 --> 42:31.198
A day later,
from his hospital bed,

42:31.280 --> 42:32.429
Bauman scribbled a note.

42:32.520 --> 42:34.909
"I know what happened."

42:35.000 --> 42:36.040
He's a real hero, my son.

42:36.080 --> 42:38.071
He's helpin' this city heal.

42:38.200 --> 42:39.553
Be Boston Strong.

42:39.640 --> 42:40.776
Is that true, Jeff?

42:40.800 --> 42:42.074
Are you Boston Strong?

42:49.040 --> 42:51.235
You did real good today, kiddo.

42:56.360 --> 42:58.749
That kind of exposure,
you know...

42:58.840 --> 43:00.478
That could lead
to opportunities.

43:02.040 --> 43:06.238
Make things, you know,

43:06.320 --> 43:08.276
easier for ya...

43:10.120 --> 43:11.872
- Yeah.
- ...down the line.

43:13.280 --> 43:16.317
You got a call from Carlos.

43:16.400 --> 43:18.118
He wants to visit with ya.

43:18.240 --> 43:21.038
And we should
be thankful for him.

43:50.120 --> 43:52.270
In here. Hey.

43:52.400 --> 43:53.400
Sir, how you doin'?

43:53.480 --> 43:54.616
- Hi. How are you?
- Paul Martino.

43:54.640 --> 43:56.358
- How are you, Paul?
- Nice to meet you.

43:56.440 --> 43:58.158
Uh, casts shouldn't
take more than...

43:58.280 --> 43:59.599
- hour, hour and a half.
- Okay.

43:59.680 --> 44:01.796
Cast is a very
quick procedure,

44:01.880 --> 44:03.711
but it's
the most important part.

44:03.800 --> 44:05.995
If we get
a good impression of you,

44:06.120 --> 44:09.032
then the rest of the procedure
is gonna go nicely.

44:09.120 --> 44:10.633
- You okay?
- Yeah.

44:10.720 --> 44:12.472
We're gonna start
on this side, okay?

44:12.560 --> 44:15.472
We're gonna slip a sock
on you here.

44:15.560 --> 44:17.516
It's just
a cotton stocking that...

44:17.600 --> 44:19.830
This is so that when
we wrap the plaster on you,

44:19.920 --> 44:22.150
it doesn't stick
directly to your skin.

44:22.240 --> 44:23.673
Did you hear the one

44:23.760 --> 44:25.751
where the farmer
was paintin' his bathroom?

44:25.840 --> 44:29.196
Figured he'd shellac
the toilet seat, make it look prettier.

44:29.280 --> 44:31.157
He didn't tell his wife.

44:31.240 --> 44:32.496
Daughter says,
"What's the matter, Dad?

44:32.520 --> 44:34.096
Ain't you ever seen
one of these before?"

44:34.120 --> 44:36.156
He says, "Yeah, I just never
saw anybody frame it."

44:40.760 --> 44:42.830
Sorry, sorry.
Sorry, Jeff.

44:42.920 --> 44:44.296
Don't make him
laugh too hard.

44:44.320 --> 44:45.639
...allow this to get hard.

44:45.720 --> 44:47.136
And then we're gonna
make a slice in it.

44:47.160 --> 44:49.151
We're gonna take it
right off you, okay?

44:49.240 --> 44:51.754
Maybe you could, uh,
use your new legs

44:51.840 --> 44:54.991
for next week
at the Bruins game, huh?

44:55.080 --> 44:56.400
Ma, that's, like,
in a week.

44:56.440 --> 44:58.715
- Yep.
- Give me a couple of weeks

44:58.840 --> 44:59.896
of fabrication and delivery.

44:59.920 --> 45:01.194
Get outta here.

45:01.280 --> 45:02.416
Couple of weeks, Jeff,
you'll be up.

45:02.440 --> 45:03.634
I can't wait.

45:03.760 --> 45:05.040
We can get you up any time.

45:05.120 --> 45:06.296
We're gonna clean up this side

45:06.320 --> 45:07.776
and then we'll go on
and do the right.

45:07.800 --> 45:08.856
We'll be just as quick, and...

45:08.880 --> 45:10.080
I wanna have it signed.

45:10.160 --> 45:11.878
- Less pain. Okay...
- Yeah, yeah.

45:11.960 --> 45:13.256
...but at least you know
what to expect.

45:13.280 --> 45:14.315
Right.

45:14.440 --> 45:15.953
They've asked him to go out

45:16.040 --> 45:17.268
on the ice and wave the flag.

45:21.280 --> 45:22.776
Jonny Gomes
coming to the plate here

45:22.800 --> 45:24.016
- for the Red Sox.
- Let's go, Jonny!

45:24.040 --> 45:25.234
Get us a fuckin' hit.

45:25.320 --> 45:26.594
Be one to one now.

45:26.680 --> 45:28.636
Don't swing at that shit.
Let that shit go.

45:28.720 --> 45:31.393
Gomes with a special bat in hand,

45:31.480 --> 45:32.754
to remember the victims

45:32.840 --> 45:34.751
- of the Marathon...
- Hey, Jeff!

45:34.840 --> 45:38.355
You hear that?
His bat says "Boston Strong."

45:38.440 --> 45:40.635
Hey, leave him be.
He's snappin' a deuce.

45:40.720 --> 45:42.312
No, no, no, no, no!

45:42.400 --> 45:43.628
God damn it.

45:43.760 --> 45:45.239
Not too good, huh?

45:45.320 --> 45:46.799
No, he fouled up.

45:46.880 --> 45:48.136
After everything
we've been through?

45:48.160 --> 45:49.434
Haven't we suffered enough?

45:49.520 --> 45:51.078
Hey, so is he gonna do it?

45:51.160 --> 45:53.230
Oh, I dunno. He's nervous.

45:53.320 --> 45:54.958
He's nervous about what?

45:55.040 --> 45:56.536
Jeff, we heard
about the Bruins game!

45:56.560 --> 45:57.834
Sounds pretty cool, bro.

45:57.920 --> 45:58.976
They're gonna give us box seats.

45:59.000 --> 46:00.000
Wait, us?

46:00.080 --> 46:01.176
Said we could
bring the whole crew.

46:01.200 --> 46:02.776
- Yo, you gotta do this, Jeff!
- Free drinks!

46:02.800 --> 46:04.392
The Bruins need ya!

46:04.480 --> 46:05.680
Don't be a pussy, bro!

46:05.760 --> 46:07.079
Shit. Ow!

46:07.200 --> 46:08.256
What kinda food they got?

46:08.280 --> 46:09.793
All-you-can-eat.

46:09.880 --> 46:11.536
It's all-you-can-eat, Jeff.
Come on, man...

46:11.560 --> 46:13.080
...stop being selfish about this shit.

46:39.080 --> 46:40.960
Is that my phone?

46:45.200 --> 46:46.519
Hello?

46:46.600 --> 46:48.670
- Smells delicious, Ma.
- Thank you.

46:48.760 --> 46:50.352
- Dad, I'm gonna sit with you.
- Sure.

46:50.440 --> 46:53.398
E-Money.
What're you doin'?

46:53.480 --> 46:55.072
Uh, talkin' to you.
What are you doin'?

46:55.160 --> 46:56.752
Dancin'.

46:56.840 --> 46:58.256
Hey, let me just
step out of the club.

46:58.280 --> 46:59.759
- What?
- Can you hear me now?

46:59.840 --> 47:01.159
Yeah, I can hear you.

47:01.960 --> 47:03.075
How you doin'?

47:04.920 --> 47:06.194
Yeah, you know.

47:07.320 --> 47:10.312
Hey, so I hope...

47:10.400 --> 47:12.868
I hope... I hope
I didn't get ya at a bad time,

47:12.960 --> 47:15.269
but I, uh, you know,
it's the, uh,

47:15.360 --> 47:18.113
Bruins playoff game
against Chicago next week,

47:18.200 --> 47:22.193
and they asked me
to come out there on the ice.

47:22.280 --> 47:23.793
On the ice?

47:23.880 --> 47:25.836
Yeah, I'm not, like, on the...
Not to play,

47:25.920 --> 47:28.150
but, y'know,
to be the banner captain

47:28.280 --> 47:29.713
and, like,
wave the flag and shit.

47:29.800 --> 47:32.394
It's kind of like
singin' the national anthem,

47:32.480 --> 47:34.789
but for people
who suck at singing.

47:38.240 --> 47:39.673
You sure you wanna do that?

47:39.760 --> 47:43.309
Well, everybody says I should.
It's the Stanley Cup, so...

47:49.880 --> 47:53.714
Listen, Erin, I...
I know we're not together, but...

47:57.640 --> 47:59.278
I was just, um...

47:59.360 --> 48:01.237
I was wondering
if maybe you wanted

48:01.320 --> 48:02.992
to come with me
and my family.

48:05.800 --> 48:08.997
I don't think that
I could do it without you.

48:09.080 --> 48:11.674
And I know that
it's not really fair of me to say.

48:11.760 --> 48:13.352
I'm really...
I'm sorry, um...

48:16.520 --> 48:17.953
But I...

48:18.080 --> 48:20.036
I really need you right now.

48:23.440 --> 48:25.032
And, uh, please.

48:25.120 --> 48:27.395
Okay. Yeah.

48:33.360 --> 48:34.936
During tonight's warm-up,

48:34.960 --> 48:37.394
we would like to invite you
to purchase

48:37.480 --> 48:39.914
raffle tickets
for the Boston Bruins...

48:40.000 --> 48:42.120
Hey, they had
that Carlos "cowboy hat" guy

48:42.160 --> 48:43.216
all over the news last night.

48:43.240 --> 48:45.754
Jeff, he told the story,
and I was fuckin' bawlin'.

48:45.840 --> 48:47.240
- You all right?
- Yeah...

48:47.280 --> 48:48.696
Gonna squeeze through
and get outta your way...

48:48.720 --> 48:50.836
- Mom's way here.
- Oh, thank you.

48:51.600 --> 48:53.830
Let's go, Boston!

48:53.920 --> 48:55.558
All right!

48:55.640 --> 48:58.313
Okay, a toast, a toast!

48:59.800 --> 49:01.119
You cool?

49:01.200 --> 49:02.315
Yeah, I'm good.

49:05.800 --> 49:08.598
Know why
they call Chicago the windy city?

49:08.680 --> 49:09.680
'Cause you guys blow!

49:09.800 --> 49:11.791
- Do you have a smoke?
- Oh, oh.

49:11.880 --> 49:15.759
Jeff, we'd like to, uh,
stage you sooner.

49:15.840 --> 49:16.896
- Oh, yeah.
- If that's all right.

49:16.920 --> 49:17.955
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

49:19.920 --> 49:21.672
- Okay.
- All right.

49:21.760 --> 49:23.480
- Let's do this!
- They're goin' now!

49:29.840 --> 49:31.273
And now...

49:57.120 --> 49:59.759
Ooh, big crowd out there.

49:59.840 --> 50:01.398
Completely full tonight.

50:06.360 --> 50:07.918
Hey, don't be nervous.

50:17.600 --> 50:19.113
How are you doin', Jeff?

50:19.200 --> 50:20.713
- Yeah, I'm great.
- You okay?

50:20.800 --> 50:22.279
Just stop here.

50:22.360 --> 50:24.191
- I'm gonna get the flag.
- Yeah.

50:25.720 --> 50:27.278
Here's the flag, Jeff.

50:27.360 --> 50:29.430
I'm gonna be standin'
right over there,

50:29.520 --> 50:32.159
and then I'm gonna signal you
when to come out, okay?

50:32.240 --> 50:33.456
All right? Have fun.

50:33.480 --> 50:35.755
Have fun, okay? Get pumped.

50:41.760 --> 50:42.875
Uh...

50:44.200 --> 50:46.316
I don't think
I can do this, E.

50:46.400 --> 50:48.595
Jeff, look,
it's gonna be okay.

50:48.680 --> 50:52.116
You just wave the flag.
And then you leave. Right?

50:52.200 --> 50:54.350
Okay, Jeff,
that's your cue. Get out there.

50:57.680 --> 51:00.433
Ladies and gentlemen.

51:00.520 --> 51:06.868
Welcome to TD Garden
and game two of the NHL playoffs.

51:08.760 --> 51:11.672
Please give
a warm Boston welcome

51:11.760 --> 51:15.150
to tonight's honorary
fan banner captain,

51:16.160 --> 51:19.994
Jeff Bauman!

51:20.080 --> 51:23.197
Jeff's continued strength
and perseverance

51:23.280 --> 51:27.990
in the face of adversity
represents all that is...

51:28.080 --> 51:31.789
Boston Strong!

51:57.200 --> 51:59.077
Go, Jeffrey!

51:59.160 --> 52:00.388
Whoo!

52:18.520 --> 52:19.920
I'm gonna get you
out of here.

52:58.560 --> 53:01.154
Get away from me.
Get the fuck away from me.

53:01.280 --> 53:02.554
- Jeff...
- Get away from me.

53:02.640 --> 53:04.119
Get away from me!

53:04.240 --> 53:05.514
You stay calm.

53:06.760 --> 53:08.432
You stay calm,
you help somebody else.

53:08.520 --> 53:09.714
Babe.

53:09.800 --> 53:11.756
- Hey. What...
- Get away from me!

53:11.840 --> 53:13.592
- Jeff!
- Get the fuck away from me.

53:13.680 --> 53:15.318
Go help somebody else!

53:15.400 --> 53:17.470
Go help somebody else!

53:18.560 --> 53:19.913
You stay calm!

53:21.080 --> 53:22.513
You stay calm!

53:27.320 --> 53:30.915
You stay calm
and go help somebody else.

54:24.440 --> 54:25.714
I'm sorry.

54:31.520 --> 54:33.954
You need to tell your family
what's going on with you.

54:36.040 --> 54:37.632
No, no.

54:37.720 --> 54:40.359
Believe me, it's better
if they don't know. Trust me.

54:43.920 --> 54:45.990
They keep trying to make
a hero out of me.

54:59.080 --> 55:00.195
Does it hurt?

55:04.760 --> 55:06.113
No.

55:09.560 --> 55:10.993
I missed you.

55:13.080 --> 55:14.672
I missed you, too.

55:43.800 --> 55:46.394
I'm here, Jeff.
I'm here.

55:48.000 --> 55:49.274
I'm here.

57:51.200 --> 57:53.316
Did you have sex with my son?

57:56.600 --> 57:57.669
Yeah.

58:02.560 --> 58:04.676
Don't you think...

58:04.760 --> 58:06.432
Shouldn't you
be leanin' on me?

58:07.800 --> 58:09.153
Hmm?

58:09.240 --> 58:12.471
I wish you were leanin' on me.

58:12.560 --> 58:14.869
I'm just happy to be
sitting here with you.

58:24.240 --> 58:27.516
They are so futuristic,
aren't they, Jeffrey?

58:27.600 --> 58:30.398
What you have is a Genium knee.

58:30.480 --> 58:32.710
Genium is a microprocessing,

58:32.800 --> 58:35.030
top-of-the-line,
high-tech knee.

58:35.120 --> 58:38.396
Two carbon fiber sockets
with suction suspension.

58:38.480 --> 58:40.152
Deep breath as you go up.

58:40.240 --> 58:41.776
And, like, you know,
you just gotta work, like,

58:41.800 --> 58:44.234
you know, your core strength
and everything,

58:44.320 --> 58:45.719
and then you gotta
stand up on 'em

58:45.800 --> 58:46.994
and get your balance right.

58:47.080 --> 58:48.672
But they're, like...
They have...

58:48.760 --> 58:51.320
They're like feet.
They are like feet and legs.

58:51.400 --> 58:52.840
And, like,
they're attached to shoes.

58:52.880 --> 58:53.915
Mm-hmm.

58:54.000 --> 58:55.000
And you can just, like...

58:56.560 --> 58:57.959
Were they cool?

58:58.040 --> 58:59.189
I'm gonna walk.

58:59.280 --> 59:01.160
You know, I'm gonna walk
with you again someday.

59:02.680 --> 59:04.910
- Read them at the same time.
- Go.

59:05.000 --> 59:06.558
See if they link up.

59:06.640 --> 59:08.136
- "Determination is...
- "Don't be hasty.

59:08.160 --> 59:09.256
- "...the wake-up call...
- "Prosperity will knock...

59:09.280 --> 59:10.496
- to the human will."
- ...on your door soon."

59:10.520 --> 59:11.555
I didn't hear yours.

59:11.640 --> 59:13.039
No, I didn't
hear yours either.

59:13.120 --> 59:14.553
Okay.

59:14.640 --> 59:15.936
- I'm gonna get it.
- All right, keep going.

59:15.960 --> 59:18.235
I'm not gonna help you.

59:18.320 --> 59:20.038
You have to eat them
to be real?

59:20.160 --> 59:21.416
That's, like, a super-loud...
You have a super-loud crunch.

59:21.440 --> 59:22.714
Arms up. Get those arms up.

59:22.800 --> 59:24.296
Do you wanna,
I don't know, like,

59:24.320 --> 59:26.880
come live with me
or somethin'?

59:31.800 --> 59:32.949
You serious?

59:33.640 --> 59:34.789
Mm-hmm.

59:41.520 --> 59:43.272
You have to tell Patty.

59:43.360 --> 59:45.157
Yeah, I'll tell Patty today.

59:47.560 --> 59:48.629
Okay.

59:50.440 --> 59:52.416
She's so hungover,
she won't even remember, all right?

59:52.440 --> 59:54.749
She won't remember.

59:54.840 --> 59:56.176
We'll be living there
for two weeks.

59:56.200 --> 59:58.395
We gotta fuckin' celebrate.

59:59.760 --> 01:00:01.318
Boston Strong!

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:05.271
...Jeff.

01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:08.553
Boston Strong!

01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:12.280
Jesus Christ. Oh, God.

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:13.696
Can you believe this shit?

01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:15.756
We needed a win, Bob.
We needed a win.

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:18.474
How we supposed
to not take this personally?

01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:19.776
Hey, you got a leaf in your drink.

01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:21.119
It's a mint leaf.

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:23.156
- A mint, huh?
- It's a mojito.

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:24.639
You muddle
the lime and the mint.

01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:26.950
You add sugar and ice,

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:28.792
and you pour
over rum, soda water.

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:30.279
You "muddle" it?

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:31.536
Yes, you muddle
the lime and the mint,

01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:33.516
and then you add
the sugar and ice.

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:34.656
Hey, when we gonna
hear this big announcement?

01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:37.640
- Yes, just tell us already.
- Oh, when the game's over.

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:39.553
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:41.056
Hey, so, Dale,
I need two burgers ready.

01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:42.376
Um, you take that down,
that would be helpful.

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:43.674
Chips, too, if you don't mind.

01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:45.296
Holy shit, you can taste
the mint, bro. Try that.

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:46.912
I'm happy
to make you guys one.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.456
Yeah,
that'd be great, yeah, sure.

01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:49.696
So nice,
you having everybody over.

01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:50.896
- Three?
- Hey, anybody that knows me

01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:52.876
knows I don't do
nothin' half-assed.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.149
Except high school.

01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:55.514
Go fuck yourself, Bob.

01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:56.656
Hey, Erin, how are things at work?

01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:57.736
You still
at Brigham and Women's?

01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:00.672
No, no, I, um...
I actually gave them my notice.

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:02.756
- Ya get fired?
- No, no...

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:04.159
What's...
What's his guy's name?

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:06.231
We're just taking some time,
Jeff and I...

01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:07.896
- I'm gonna be there...
- That's wonderful, honey.

01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:09.400
...through the therapy
and everything.

01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:10.993
- Yeah.
- I'm moving in, actually.

01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:12.576
- Huh.
- So, just to be around, you know?

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:13.635
Wait, what?

01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:16.073
Jeff told you.

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:18.834
You knew that.

01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:20.148
No.

01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:21.336
Jeff, you didn't
tell your mom?

01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:23.351
- Huh?
- Jeff?

01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:25.590
You didn't tell your mom
I was moving in?

01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:28.274
I... I thought
that's what today was for.

01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:31.909
Like, you know, uh,
announcements and shit.

01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:36.271
Very small apartment
for three people, Jeffrey.

01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:38.669
Yeah, but technically
it's only like two and a half.

01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:44.395
That ain't funny.

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:47.152
That ain't funny.

01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:49.708
Oh, Patty, did you give
everyone the big news?

01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:52.553
What?
You told him, and you didn't tell us?

01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:53.789
She didn't tell me shit.

01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:56.110
I just knew there was
gonna be a big announcement.

01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:57.536
- Yeah, what's goin' on?
- So, spill it already. Christ!

01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:00.028
All right, all right,
all right, okay. This is it.

01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:01.176
- Come on, get me up.
- Patty.

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:02.758
Get me up.

01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:04.956
Okay, listen up,
this is how it's gonna be...

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:06.712
Fasten your seat belts.

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:12.428
Oprah's comin'.

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:14.351
Oh, my God!

01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:17.588
Shut up!

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:21.150
Oprah called me!

01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:24.391
She is flyin' down
to interview Jeffrey.

01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:26.016
- Day after tomorrow.
- Oh, you gotta be kidding me!

01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:27.080
You're gonna meet Stedman!

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:28.160
- Hey, man.
- No, no, no.

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:30.056
- Oprah's fat ass...
- Gayle! Oprah!

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:31.080
She's comin' to...

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:32.878
- Patty. Patty.
- What?

01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:34.176
Jeff's not doing
that stuff anymore.

01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:35.633
What do you mean?
Fuck.

01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:36.835
- Fuck off.
- Uh-huh.

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:38.512
- He's not.
- Come on, it's Oprah.

01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:40.216
He's not doing interviews.
He's not doin'...

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:41.656
- Jeffrey?
- ...public appearances.

01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:43.136
- None of that.
- Jeffrey, talk to me.

01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:44.160
It's too much.

01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:46.510
- Jeffie.
- It's not good for him.

01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:47.856
- It's too much, because...
- Yeah, 'course he is.

01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:49.416
- It's fuckin' Oprah Winfrey.
- He doesn't want...

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:51.016
She's the most famous
person in the world.

01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:53.296
Patty, all those people
looking at him, asking him questions

01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:54.376
- and needing something.
- Yeah, butt out.

01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:55.799
Come on, Jeffrey, talk to me.

01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:57.313
It's a lot of pressure.

01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:59.936
And somebody's always tryin' to take
something from him. It's too much.

01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:01.296
You gonna let her do this,
or you gonna tell me for yourself?

01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:02.736
- It's too much, Patty.
- I wanna hear from you.

01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:04.034
I'm speaking for him.

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:05.256
You're not so drunk
ya can't speak to me.

01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:08.041
- If you would listen to me...
- No, you don't speak for my son.

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:15.875
Why'd you...
why didn't you tell me sooner?

01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:17.791
- What?
- Why didn't you tell me sooner?

01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:19.936
Because... Why do you think?
I wanted to make it a surprise.

01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:23.077
I wanted a big announcement.
You know?

01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:25.390
- It's Oprah Winfrey.
- I'm sorry, Ma.

01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:29.957
Where would I have
been without Oprah?

01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:32.878
She got me through
the bad times.

01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:34.520
And I don't know where,
what I would be.

01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:35.736
I would've...
I would've hung myself

01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:37.478
in the bathroom without Oprah.

01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:38.754
Just sayin'.

01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:41.714
Just sayin'.

01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:47.675
So, hey,
if Oprah's your lifeline,

01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:49.160
you got a lot
deeper issues, Patty.

01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:50.296
- I'm just sayin'.
- Fuck you, Bob.

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:51.469
Shut up, Bob.

01:03:56.920 --> 01:04:00.356
I just wanted people to see
how amazing my son is.

01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:01.708
That's all.

01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:05.519
What's so bad about that?

01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:23.032
Aw, E, come on.

01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:24.917
sorry.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.592
- E, come on, push it.
- I am.

01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:27.715
There ya go.

01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:32.075
I got it.

01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:37.712
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:38.869
Oh, how you doin'?

01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:40.871
Um, really well. How are you?

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:42.552
Sully bought me
a fuckin' sombrero.

01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:43.868
- I'm...
- He did?

01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:45.075
- Yeah.
- This is from him?

01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:46.388
Yeah, he said he was out

01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:48.080
at a Mexican restaurant
last night, so...

01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:52.597
They got super hammered
and brought back two sombreros,

01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:53.954
and I got one of 'em.

01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:55.473
Lucky.

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:06.358
- One...
- Two, three!

01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:09.958
- Oh, fuck.
- Fuck.

01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:12.918
Are you fuckin' kiddin' me?

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.479
I'm sorry.

01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:19.352
♪ Let my love open the door ♪

01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:23.793
♪ Let my love open the door ♪

01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:27.876

- It's not over.
- Oh, God.

01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:43.510
You listen to this one, Jeffrey.

01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:45.113
Listen to this.

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:48.078
This is from Denver, Colorado.

01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:53.359
"You... I have never seen a stronger,

01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:57.638
more brilliant person
in my life."

01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:59.073
Go to sleep, Ma.

01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:00.957
"Thank you so much."

01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:03.235
She's talkin' about you,
Jeffrey.

01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:05.155
Jeffrey?

01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:08.789
She's talkin' about my son.

01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:11.792
Hey, Jeffrey, we should go...
we should go to Colorado.

01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:13.313
- We should go to Denver.
- Ma.

01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:15.630
And go see those nice people.

01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:18.314
I think we should
go to Denver, baby.

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:20.152
We should go to Denver
when you're better.

01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:22.473
Just you and me, huh?

01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:24.790
Go to fuckin' sleep, Ma!

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:26.632
Oh, all right.

01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:28.119
Bye.

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:30.555
I don't wanna hear
any more of those letters.

01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:33.074
Don't forget
about the Red Sox.

01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:35.230
Want you to throw out
the first pitch.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.718
Look, I gotta tap out, boys.

01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:40.994
I have rehab in the morning.

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:43.389
I don't want
the lady gettin' pissed.

01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:45.715
- Want some pills?
- You fuckin' retarded, Sully?

01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:47.279
I just told you,
I gotta get home.

01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:48.509
- What are they?
- Not sure.

01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:50.033
Found 'em
on my sister's dresser.

01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:52.111
You're either
gonna get high as fuck,

01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:54.350
or they're gonna
regulate our periods.

01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:56.078
Pretty sure.

01:06:56.160 --> 01:06:59.675
Excuse me.
Are you Jeff Bauman?

01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:01.239
We have been
following your story

01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:03.072
ever since we saw that photo.

01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:05.256
Then we saw you
at the Bruins game, wavin' the flag.

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:06.872
It's so good
to see you're healed

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.513
and that you didn't
let them win.

01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:10.670
- Can we take a picture?
- Yeah, sure.

01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:12.398
- Okay.
- Who didn't I let win?

01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:13.833
The terrorists.

01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:17.080
Can we... yeah,
let's get a picture with him.

01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:18.348
Oh, right, yeah.

01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:20.510
- Are you sure about that?
- Yeah.

01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:22.358
'Cause I mean, like...

01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:24.078
where I'm sittin'...

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:26.400
you know, looks like they
at least got on the scoreboard.

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:27.880
You know,
I'm never gonna walk again.

01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:29.552
Ooh!

01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:32.678
All right. One more,
one more, one more.

01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:34.456
You don't get this picture,
I'm gonna fucking kill myself.

01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:35.833
Just one more.

01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:38.279
Hey, Jeff!

01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:40.032
God bless you.
Thank you, Jeff.

01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:41.473
It was so nice to meet you.

01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:42.696
Keep your stumps
together, though.

01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:43.776
No. Come on,
give me some speed!

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:44.880
Oh, watch it, I'll get him.

01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:46.234
Get him higher, Sull.

01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:47.548
He's not gonna clear it.

01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:49.816
- Fuckin' clear over your fuckin' head!
- Sull, get 'em up!

01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:51.616
- Come on, get me up, Sull!
- Get him up, Sull!

01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:52.868
Here we go.

01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:54.296
Use your arms, Sull,
use your arms!

01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:55.816
- I think I'm gonna puke.
- Shut up!

01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:57.376
- It's great!
- Please...

01:07:57.400 --> 01:07:59.038
- Shut the fuck...
- Gets...

01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:00.235
Oh, shit!

01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:02.117
Oh, shit!

01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:04.395
Fuck you, Bauman.

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:05.629
I spilled my beer.

01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:06.914
Watch me do a flip.

01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:12.833
I give it a seven!

01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:14.478
- Seven?
- I give it a seven!

01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:16.198
Excuse me, excuse me!

01:08:16.319 --> 01:08:18.754
That was a six.
That's a generous six.

01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:20.353
At most.

01:08:20.439 --> 01:08:22.040
He didn't stick
the fucking landing, bro.

01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:23.675
Oh!

01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:25.033
Ouch.

01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:27.116
A tour of their facility.

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:30.033
But I'm gonna get a...
should get a medal.

01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:32.509
I'm your fuckin' hero.

01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:34.272
Why, thank you.

01:08:34.359 --> 01:08:35.952
You're welcome.

01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:39.395
For finding the fucking bombers,
you piece of shit.

01:08:39.479 --> 01:08:42.118
I should not be operating
machinery tonight.

01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:45.670
Hey! Hey! Easy!

01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:46.953
Shit, Sull. Ah!

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:49.952
Sull, didn't you get your license
yanked for driving drunk?

01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:51.871
Didn't you blow, like, a .08?

01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:54.109
Better than who you blew
last week.

01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:57.828
Hey! Hey.
Sull, no, you'll go to jail.

01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:00.080
I'm just trying
to get you home

01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:01.639
before your fuckin' wife
kills us.

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:04.951
No, she's not my wife!
Give me the keys.

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:06.519
Do you still even
got a license?

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:08.875
No, they don't lose...
you don't lose your license

01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:10.996
when you fuckin' lose your legs.
Dumbass.

01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:12.593
How you gonna
reach the pedals?

01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:15.877
Fuckin' get down there.
You gonna push 'em for me.

01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:17.359
Is that even safe?

01:09:19.399 --> 01:09:20.594
No.

01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:23.120
Okay.

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:26.314
There you go, buddy.

01:09:26.399 --> 01:09:28.993
Get down there.

01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:30.877
Hey! Watch... Watch the leg.
Sorry. Sorry.

01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:37.872
Gas. Gas.

01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:39.313
Gas.

01:09:39.399 --> 01:09:40.549
Gas, gas, gas.

01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:41.788
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:43.471
No!
Brake, brake, brake, brake!

01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:47.352
Got it? You got it?

01:09:47.439 --> 01:09:48.496
- Yeah.
- Oh, shit.

01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:50.908
- You all right?
- Shit.

01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:52.189
Fuckin' got it.

01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:55.509
I got it. Go.

01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:00.509
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:02.113
Brake, brake, brake, brake!

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:07.234
Be my legs, Sull.
All right. Be my legs.

01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:09.056
Who the fuck's
pressin' the pedals, Jeff?

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:10.877
Go back to sleep,
you alcoholic!

01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:12.439
Where is he? Oh, shit.

01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:14.016
Sull, I said the pedals,
not my cock, buddy.

01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:15.216
What are you
doing down there?

01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:17.176
- Dude, D, I got my legs back, D!
- Whoo-hoo!

01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:18.553
Brake pedal?

01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:19.993
That was pretty awesome...

01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:21.576
Let's go do donuts.
Jeff, let's do donuts.

01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:23.989
- Brake pedal.
- Oh, shit!

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:25.274
You gotta stop! Stop!

01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:27.635
Come on!
Don't be a pussy!

01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:29.160
Don't let
the fuckin' terrorists win!

01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:30.952
Brake pedal, gas pedal.

01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:32.915
Sull, gas, gas.

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:34.598
Whoa. Brake, brake, brake.

01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:35.999
No, go over the hill!

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:38.230
Sull! Easy, easy,
easy on the gas.

01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:39.548
Easy on the gas, bro.

01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:40.959
Whoa, shit! Shit!

01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:43.919
Police out. Whoa!

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.456
Pull the car over.

01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:46.549
There you go, Sull.

01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:48.392
- Oh, shit.
- Pull over now!

01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:50.198
Brake, brake, brake,
Sully, brake, brake!

01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:51.759
Brake pedal.

01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:53.273
Whoa!

01:10:57.080 --> 01:10:58.638
Put up your hands!

01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:01.951
Let me see your hands!

01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:04.839
Roll your window down!

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.200
Roll down your fuckin' window!

01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:08.679
All right, okay,
sorry, all right.

01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:09.954
Sull, you gotta get up, Sull.

01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:11.360
Anybody else in that car?

01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:16.990
Let me see your hands,
too, pal!

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:25.151
Hey, wait a minute.

01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:29.553
You Jeff Bauman?

01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:33.273
Yeah, yeah.

01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:34.395
What?

01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:36.679
- Yeah.
- You are?

01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:38.671
Yeah.

01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:40.239
Can I get a picture with you?

01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:45.040
You, um, put the sauce in too early,

01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:46.957
it falls right to the bottom
of the cake.

01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:48.359
Look at that. So soft.

01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:49.536
And if you put it in too late,

01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:50.993
it sits right at the top edge.

01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:52.877
Oh, I love that.
That's a fun fact.

01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:03.914
You take your pill?

01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:09.874
- Did you take your medication?
- No.

01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:12.838
Jeff?

01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:14.478
- No.
- Hello? What?

01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:16.033
- No.
- No?

01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:17.917
Could you take it, please?

01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:23.670
Please, please, please?

01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:25.830
Please? Pause it.

01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:28.672
- Pause?
- No, keep going.

01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:31.035
Hey, wasn't Patty supposed
to take you to rehab?

01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:36.515
Pill packer.

01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:38.056
Wanna go in front
of all those people

01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:39.513
with the noise and the lights?

01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:41.238
You'll be there.

01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:43.256
You don't even have
to be there, Erin, you know?

01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:45.874
Jeff is goin' out on the field
with the Carlos guy.

01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:47.837
It's why he's eatin' lunch
with him next week.

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:48.955
My God.

01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:50.189
He's gonna get to know him.

01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:51.713
People think of them
as a team.

01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:53.438
No, you think of us
as a team, Ma.

01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:55.829
No, the whole fuckin' world
thinks of you as a team.

01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:57.296
- It's not just me.
- It's just weird.

01:12:57.320 --> 01:12:58.799
I don't wanna meet him,
I told you.

01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:00.496
- Oh, Jesus, Jeff.
- Hey, guys.

01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:02.096
God's sake,
I made the fuckin' reservation.

01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:03.599
I don't wanna
meet Carlos.

01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:05.096
I don't wanna relive
the worst day of my life.

01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:06.439
We really have to be

01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:07.656
on time for these
appointments. Okay?

01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:08.840
We got stuck in traffic.

01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:10.638
Yeah,
she forgot the sleeves.

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:11.720
She forgot the sleeves.

01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:13.028
You okay?

01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:17.879
Let's get about
a 30-second count there, okay?

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:20.599
Just add a little more
strengthening to it, okay?

01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:23.114
So let's start off
with the right arm,

01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:25.350
left leg for a count of...

01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:29.115
one, two, three, four...

01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:31.191
Remember, concentrate here
on the glutes.

01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:32.759
Don't arch your back.

01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:34.296
This is the first time
you're in this week,

01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:35.799
and you have
three appointments.

01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:37.871
Okay?

01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:40.235
You gotta get in here
as many times as you can

01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:41.496
- for your appointments...
- I know.

01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:42.839
I keep tellin' 'em, y'know?

01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:44.160
...or it's not gonna work,
okay?

01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:46.077
You have to keep
your appointments,

01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:48.674
and you have to come in
ready to work.

01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:51.399
I mean, look at everybody
around here, Jeff.

01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:53.096
They're recovering because
they put the time

01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:54.838
and the energy into it.

01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:57.354
And they make it a priority.
And you have to do that, too.

01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:34.576
Did you find everything?

01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:36.318
Yeah.

01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:37.958
Do you have a bathroom?

01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:39.678
We do.
It's right over in the corner.

01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:06.080
Jeff?

01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:10.755
Jeff?

01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:32.355
Jeff.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.399
Jeff.

01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:44.871
Wake up.

01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:46.188
Wake up.

01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:50.071
You and Patty get hammered?

01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:54.435
Wake up.

01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:18.551
- Blanket?
- Mm-hmm.

01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:37.631
- You want the board?
- Yeah.

01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:49.312
Can I have my Gatorade?

01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:55.880
I got it.

01:16:57.720 --> 01:16:59.472
Yeah, he'll be helpin' the Red Sox.

01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:01.915
It's his favorite team
since he was a little boy.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:03.296
Jeff's throwin' out
the first pitch

01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:05.038
isn't gonna help 'em win,
Patty.

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:06.176
Bruins lost that game
that we went to.

01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:07.553
Whoa!

01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:09.016
Thought we said we weren't
gonna say that out loud.

01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:11.349
You see,
the fact you say that, Erin,

01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:14.438
shows how little
you know about baseball.

01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:17.034
Are you...
are you even from here?

01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:28.840
- Smart.
- Okay.

01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:29.880
Huh? What?

01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:38.957
- How they feel? Good?
- Yeah.

01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:40.234
All set?

01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:43.759
All right, when you're ready,

01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:47.310
you're gonna scooch ahead
before you stand up.

01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:48.896
Okay, let me just
straighten that leg there.

01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:50.672
Mm-hmm.

01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:56.032
- Yup.
- Okay.

01:17:57.720 --> 01:17:58.869
Okay, scooch ahead.

01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:00.996
Okay, got it.
I'm gonna get it.

01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:05.710
Up. Hips back, hips back.
Chest up.

01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:07.358
- Chest up.
- Jeffie. You're up!

01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:09.556
Chest up, okay? Chest up.

01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:11.517
- My God!
- Chest up. Chest up.

01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:13.511
Good, good. Okay? Good.

01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:15.318
That's amazing. Wow.

01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:16.400
You okay?

01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:17.595
God, you are so tall.

01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:19.193
All right? Okay.

01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:20.998
It's a little sore there.

01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:22.115
Oh, my God.

01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:23.394
Okay.

01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:25.232
Nah, it's like needles
in my legs.

01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:26.548
- Okay.
- Yeah,

01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:28.352
but you look awesome.

01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:29.953
Good job, Jeff.

01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:32.600
Oh, you're amazing, Jeffie.
Looks amazing.

01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:33.800
It's the first time.

01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:35.040
Keep goin'. Keep goin'.

01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:36.997
- I can't, I can't.
- Good job.

01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:38.456
- Let him sit.
- I gotta sit down.

01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:39.515
Okay, yup. Okay.

01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:43.148
Good job. Good job.

01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:48.296
Wheels, before...
It's gonna make it easier for ya.

01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:49.936
- Ya lock the wheels first.
- Yeah, I just... I did.

01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:51.216
- E.
- And then ya pull up the seat.

01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:53.549
Hey, E,
can you get my Gatorade?

01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:54.834
I don't have it.

01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:56.592
- Ya didn't lock...
- Fuckin'...

01:18:56.680 --> 01:18:57.736
...the wheels, 'cause if you did,
it wouldn't be movin'.

01:18:57.760 --> 01:18:59.416
- No, you still haven't done it!
- Would you back off?

01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:00.475
- Oh...
- Patty!

01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:01.640
What?

01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:03.392
Jesus Christ,
I'm sick of this shit.

01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:05.755
- I'm sick of both of you.
- What?

01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:07.353
E, what the fuck? Calm down.

01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:09.136
I'm tired of you fuckin' talkin'
to me like I'm an idiot.

01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:10.434
A child is what you are.

01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:11.936
Okay? I am not an idiot, Patty.

01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:13.416
- Every time you open your...
- Ma, cut it out.

01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:15.351
This is behavior
I've come to know and love.

01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:16.656
Do you understand me?
Really, I can't...

01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:18.272
I'm just callin' it like it is.

01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:20.590
- I'm tired, Jeff, okay?
- Everybody's tired!

01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:22.120
This didn't just happen to you.

01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:23.616
What do you mean,
it didn't just happen to me?

01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:25.278
It did just happen to me!

01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:27.096
Could you just open your eyes
for one fucking second,

01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:29.111
and acknowledge
the huge circle...

01:19:29.240 --> 01:19:31.037
Look at me! Look at me!

01:19:31.160 --> 01:19:32.878
Jeff, the huge circle of people

01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:34.632
that have fucking
altered their lives

01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:37.234
to orbit around you. Okay?

01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:38.958
You have no fucking idea
how much...

01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:40.712
You act like this
is fucking easy for him!

01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:42.472
When do I act like this is easy?

01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:44.278
Last night,
he's fucking wasted

01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:45.896
- and covered in his own shit.
- Hey...

01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:47.148
And I have to clean him up.

01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:48.496
And nobody else is there
helping me.

01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:49.840
Oh, it's my fault?

01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:51.256
I have to carry him
to the bed.

01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:52.656
Can you not fucking say that
right now?

01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:54.016
- What?
- Can you not talk

01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:55.416
- about that right now?
- People are watching!

01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:57.158
I don't give a fuck.
I don't give a shit.

01:19:57.240 --> 01:19:59.800
Well, maybe they don't teach
you manners in Amesbury, huh?

01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:02.269
You say one more fucking thing
about Amesbury, Patty,

01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:03.976
I'll punch you in the fucking face.
Do you understand that?

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.309
- Don't you... don't you threaten me.
- Get in the car!

01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:07.799
Go. Get in the car.

01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:09.536
You gonna let her
talk to me this way?

01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:12.518
Yeah, just fuckin' walk away.
You're not on the team.

01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:19.096
So you wanna
tell me what's goin' on?

01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:21.315
Uh, stress, lack of sleep,

01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:24.198
uh, minor surgeries,
fittings for his legs.

01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:25.474
Okay.

01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:26.993
Physical therapy sessions.

01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:28.115
His mom yelling at me

01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:29.256
for every fuckin' thing
I have ever done.

01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:31.350
I knew this was gonna happen.

01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:34.034
This is what you do, you just...
you take on too much.

01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:35.336
You take on
other people's problems

01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:36.759
and you forget yourself.

01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:41.637
Uh, what the fuck is this?

01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:45.176
Did... Please tell me
you found this in a dumpster

01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:46.872
and you're playing
some prank on me.

01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:51.558
I'm just kidding.
Okay. Uh... fuck.

01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:52.675
Um, how long?

01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:55.634
Five weeks.

01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:00.675
Does he know?

01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:03.400
No.

01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:06.357
I'm tellin' him tonight.

01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:14.198
Here we go.

01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:15.508
Yeah, so I saw...

01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:17.198
Saw him on the news
again yesterday.

01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:20.033
That's good rotation
on that.

01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:21.394
It's like a shish kebab.

01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:23.192
Burn that shit.

01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:24.633
Oh, yeah, light that up.

01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:27.188
Give him that...
That goddamn cowboy hat.

01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:28.998
It's a whole event, that hat.

01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:30.616
He really wear
that thing in real life?

01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:31.696
You still talkin' about
that Mexican guy?

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:33.756
Costa Rican. Jesus, Bob.

01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:35.876
- Welcome to 1965, buddy.
- You know what I meant.

01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:37.871
For God's sakes.

01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:39.776
I tell ya what, I'd really
like to meet that guy.

01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:41.711
Costa Rican, Mexican,
Honduran, whatever he is.

01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:43.358
I don't care.

01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:45.351
Why?

01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:47.158
He's a fuckin' American hero,
Jeffie.

01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:48.912
Not for him,
you wouldn't be sittin' here

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.070
- drinkin' beers on my tab.
- Fuck that guy.

01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:53.594
Come to think of it,
maybe he ought to pay.

01:21:56.280 --> 01:21:57.920
Hey, Jeffie,
wasn't I supposed to take you

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.912
to pick up your girl,
like, 10 minutes ago?

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.638
Hey, you want...
Who wants another round?

01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:04.073
I'll have one. Who's paying?

01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:08.393
- Who you think?
- Not you.

01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:09.549
Uncle Bob.

01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:29.056
Hey, can I just get the check?

01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:30.513
What's up?

01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:32.520
- Can I just get the check?
- Oh, sure.

01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:37.953
Yeah, four... four mai tais.

01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:39.456
Give me an order
of fried rice

01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:41.198
and some, uh, chicken wings.

01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:42.474
Yeah, yeah.

01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:54.151
I dunno.
I like pizza, too.

01:22:55.400 --> 01:22:56.515
Don't forget my order.

01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:01.310
Hey, you're the guy.
From the wheelchair.

01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:03.296
One in the picture with the guy
in the fuckin' cowboy hat?

01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:04.355
Yeah.

01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:06.032
- Yeah.
- Hey, that's awesome.

01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:07.348
Hey, you know what?

01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:09.590
Me and this
fuckin' handsome guy,

01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:11.159
we work, like, 10 blocks away

01:23:11.240 --> 01:23:12.480
from where
the bombin' happened.

01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:14.158
- Yeah.
- It's fuckin' crazy, right?

01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:15.753
Yeah, like, right there.

01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:17.016
- We were right there.
- Right there.

01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:18.256
We saw
the whole fuckin' thing.

01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:19.736
- Hey, you know what, though?
- No shit.

01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:22.433
Let me ask you. That whole thing,
it was a conspiracy, right?

01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:23.555
Mai tais?

01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:24.856
The whole thing
was a hoax.

01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:26.199
Yeah.

01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:27.998
It was like a fuckin' false flag.

01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:31.356
It was like it didn't happen.
It was all, like, bullshit.

01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:34.591
Fuckin' so Obama could
send us to war with Iran.

01:23:34.680 --> 01:23:36.716
We're not gonna tell anybody.

01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:37.800
- What?
- You...

01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:39.518
You got paid
to do the bombing.

01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:41.192
Fuckin' Obama
did this whole thing

01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:42.998
so we'd go to a war
with Iran, bro.

01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:44.536
What the fuck
are you talking about?

01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:45.776
- He's got a point.
- Hey, you know what?

01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:47.296
We're already at war with lran,
you fuckin' douchebag.

01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:48.320
Oh, yeah?

01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:50.277
- Ooh.
- Fuckin' douchebag?

01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:51.952
- The fuck you talkin'...
- Fuck you.

01:23:52.040 --> 01:23:54.349
- Calm down.
- Yo, this guy's fuckin' phony-baloney.

01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:55.576
- Easy, easy...
- Phony-baloney.

01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:57.033
Fuck you!

01:23:57.120 --> 01:23:58.720
- Hey, come on, man!
- Say, take it easy.

01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:00.916
Go fuckin' make pizza,
you piece of shit.

01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:04.989
Fuck you, man.

01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:07.548
You're fuckin' nuts, buddy!

01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:11.838
Come on!
Somebody fuckin' hit me!

01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:14.718
Fuckin' hit me, huh?

01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:16.552
Fuckin' hit me!

01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:19.796
Fuckin' hit me!

01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:20.880
Hey, stop, stop.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:24.831
I got your messages after,

01:24:24.920 --> 01:24:26.433
when I was
tryin' to call you.

01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:28.590
That's such bullshit, Jeff.

01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:51.148
You drunk?

01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:56.033
Not anymore.

01:24:56.120 --> 01:24:58.076
Were you ever gonna
show up tonight?

01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:00.435
Or were you just gonna
leave me sitting there?

01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:06.669
What is this?

01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:09.234
- Open it.
- What is it?

01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:10.435
- Open it.
- Why?

01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:11.669
Open the letter.

01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:20.232
"Someone small
and wonderful

01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:21.992
is about to happen to you."

01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:24.438
"Someone small and..."

01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:30.752
Is this a fuckin' joke?

01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:33.513
No, it's not a joke.
Why would I joke about this?

01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:41.474
Is this like a...

01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:42.675
Yeah.

01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:45.998
Like what...

01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:53.991
I can't do this.

01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:56.036
Someone else
you don't show up for.

01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:00.959
Erin, you... you...

01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:03.600
Jeff, I gave up
my family for you.

01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:06.280
And my job.
I'm not giving this up, too.

01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:07.793
This is bigger than you.

01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:09.279
I thought you were careful.

01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:11.271
Careful?

01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:13.954
- I can't do this.
- I can't do it.

01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:15.416
I can't raise a kid.
I can't look after him.

01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:16.896
I can't... I can't look...

01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:17.955
What am I supposed to do?

01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:19.553
I'm supposed
to chase after him?

01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:21.120
Like, I'm supposed
to chase after him?

01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:22.713
How am I gonna
take care of him?

01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:24.438
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna mess him up.

01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:25.696
Yes, you are gonna
mess him up.

01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:26.976
But not because
you don't have legs.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.514
Because you're
a fucking kid still.

01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:30.999
You let your mom
push you around

01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:32.997
like a baby in a stroller.

01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:34.399
Oh, fuck you, Erin.

01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:35.515
You do!

01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:37.192
Fuck you, Erin!

01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:38.713
You just have to show up
for once.

01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:39.915
- Show up?
- Yes.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:41.319
- Show up?
- Yes!

01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:44.710
I fucking showed up for you!
I showed up!

01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:46.677
I was standing there for you!

01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:48.296
- Oh, fuckin' what...
- And look what it got me!

01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:49.833
So this is my fault, then?

01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:51.353
I showed up for you!

01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:52.839
All of this
is my fault, right?

01:26:52.920 --> 01:26:54.148
I showed up for you!

01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:56.000
It doesn't scare me!
Just show up, that's it!

01:26:56.080 --> 01:26:59.755
I can't! I can't! I can't!
I can't do it!

01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:01.876
Why do you even want me?

01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:04.520
Why? I'm such a fuckup!

01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:13.234
Can't do it. I'm not...
I can't do it. I can't.

01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:26.591
Don't walk away from me. Erin!

01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:31.675
Erin!

01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:35.392
Erin!

01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:38.955
Don't walk away from me.

01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:41.474
Erin! Erin!

01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:43.516
Erin!

01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:46.956
Erin, don't walk away from...
Erin!

01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:49.474
Hey!

01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:03.990
Mind your own fuckin' business!

01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:19.828
Hey!

01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:24.750
Erin!

01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:38.793
Hey!

01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:40.359
Open the door!

01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:43.511
Erin!

01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:45.909
Erin. Erin.

01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:48.911
Erin. Erin!

01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:56.559
Please!
Please! Please!

01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:52.831
Go help somebody else.

01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:54.592
Lay back, I got you.
I got you.

01:29:55.480 --> 01:29:57.038
Help somebody else!

01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:00.434
Stay calm.

01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:02.875
Go help somebody else.
I'm good.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:16.274
This one's critical.

01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:43.833
We need help.

01:30:52.040 --> 01:30:54.031
Hold on. Just relax.

01:30:56.200 --> 01:30:59.476
You're going to be okay.
Help is coming.

01:30:59.560 --> 01:31:01.630
Over here!
We need a chair over here.

01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:18.794
Erin...

01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:25.510
Please, open the door.

01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:43.673
Carlos.

01:31:45.240 --> 01:31:46.673
Jeff.

01:31:55.640 --> 01:31:57.596
Oh, you want one of these?

01:31:57.680 --> 01:31:58.999
Uh... coffee, please.

01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:00.416
Want a beer,
anything like that?

01:32:00.440 --> 01:32:01.555
No. Thank you.

01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:04.675
It's too early for me.

01:32:06.440 --> 01:32:08.237
Not for me.

01:32:10.840 --> 01:32:12.558
Well, thanks for showing up.

01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:16.312
It's the least I could do.

01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:28.589
So...

01:32:28.680 --> 01:32:29.715
Yeah.

01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:36.871
Why were you there?

01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:38.393
At the finish line?

01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:41.711
Yeah, I mean, y'know, like,
based on that hat

01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:44.633
and my limited knowledge
of aerodynamics,

01:32:44.720 --> 01:32:46.296
I assume it wasn't to run.

01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:50.029
No, no, I...
I wasn't there to run, I...

01:32:50.120 --> 01:32:52.156
I was there for my boys.

01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:53.593
They were running in the...

01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:55.716
No, no, my...

01:32:55.840 --> 01:32:57.512
my boys are dead.

01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:02.473
Shit.

01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:04.278
They died years ago.

01:33:05.120 --> 01:33:06.599
Uh...

01:33:06.680 --> 01:33:09.114
Oh. Thank you.

01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:23.353
Do you have kids?

01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:24.793
Mmm. Uh...

01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:28.794
Mm.

01:33:31.320 --> 01:33:33.675
Alex, uh, was my oldest.

01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:35.671
Uh, he was a Marine,

01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:38.149
but he got killed
by a sniper in Najaf.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:41.911
You know,
the way I find out is,

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.195
a van pulls up in front
of my house, and...

01:33:44.280 --> 01:33:47.670
and three Marines,
they get out.

01:33:49.680 --> 01:33:51.432
But I knew.

01:33:51.560 --> 01:33:54.154
I knew before they rang
the doorbell, I knew.

01:33:56.280 --> 01:33:59.078
And then I did something
very stupid, right?

01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:02.869
I grabbed a can of gasoline
and a blowtorch,

01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:05.633
and I ran past them and...

01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:10.158
And I locked myself
in their van.

01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:12.470
They tried to pull me out.
The...

01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:15.154
the blowtorch sparked,
and I, um...

01:34:19.240 --> 01:34:20.912
Those Marines,

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.719
they could have died,
and they saved me.

01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:29.671
The worst part is, I...

01:34:29.760 --> 01:34:32.638
I had to go to my son's
funeral on a stretcher.

01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:36.636
I'm not proud of that,
you know.

01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:42.559
What about
your other son?

01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:44.874
Brian.

01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:48.871
You remind me of Brian.

01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:52.633
He took his own life.

01:34:54.080 --> 01:34:55.672
It was too much for him.

01:34:55.760 --> 01:34:58.672
You know, losing his brother,
and seeing me like that.

01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:03.553
Shit, Carlos.

01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:07.877
I can't tell you how much

01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:11.032
I wish I had been there
for them when they needed me.

01:35:13.960 --> 01:35:16.554
Hmm. But now I...

01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:19.552
I travel the country,
talking to soldiers.

01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:22.916
Mostly about PTSD
and depression.

01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:27.238
I help a little.

01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:29.072
And it keeps me going.

01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:33.352
But the truth is...

01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:37.991
I don't understand.

01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:39.559
Mmm.

01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:53.388
I was there that day
at the finish line

01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:56.119
handing out American flags
for my boys.

01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:08.396
When the first bomb
went off,

01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:11.756
I looked up,
and I saw a big ball of fire, and...

01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:16.510
my body wanted to run.

01:36:16.600 --> 01:36:20.957
But I thought,
"This is a moment," huh?

01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:23.600
"Make a better choice."

01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:25.910
So I ran to the fire,
and there you were.

01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:29.715
Helping you...

01:36:29.800 --> 01:36:31.472
made me feel...

01:36:31.560 --> 01:36:34.120
like I had helped my son.

01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:37.390
And for that,
I am grateful.

01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:42.153
You're grateful?

01:36:44.040 --> 01:36:45.109
Yeah.

01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:50.114
You help me
as much as I help you.

01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:54.834
And I came here to say,
"Thank you."

01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:01.469
Hmm.

01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:06.158
Straight to voicemail, huh?

01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:08.470
I don't blame ya.

01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:11.632
Listen,
I've been thinking, um...

01:38:11.720 --> 01:38:15.269
You know, our... our kid,
he or she

01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:20.354
is, uh... gonna have legs.

01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:25.637
You're gonna be, like,
a really good mom.

01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:29.508
'Cause you been dealin' with
a big, dumb kid already.

01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:30.919
Sittin' here, uh,

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.230
bein' without you, it's like
the worst fuckin' thing

01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:34.912
that's ever happened to me.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:39.718
By a long shot.

01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:44.398
There was this, like,
there was this time

01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:46.875
in the hospital when, like, I...

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.070
I just wanna give up.

01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:51.912
Y'know, like, where I...

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.116
just, like,
didn't care if I...

01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:57.118
- Come on. Come on.
- ...died or not. And...

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.275
now I just wanna...

01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:02.918
Come on, man.
Come on, man.

01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:04.473
Come on, man.

01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:06.039
I just wanna walk.

01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:07.553
Y'know, I just wanna stand up.

01:39:07.640 --> 01:39:11.269
I wanna see the world
from higher up, y'know?

01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:13.271
I just...
I just wanna be normal.

01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:15.993
Conference on the mound.

01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:17.536
You wanna just go
out there and just make

01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:18.896
a fool outta yourself
in front of everybody?

01:39:18.920 --> 01:39:19.976
You can't do it like this.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:21.296
What, I got the catcher
walkin' out to the...

01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:22.600
- Let's go, Coach.
- What?

01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:24.113
I'm gonna put him in.

01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:26.475
What are you talkin' about?
I threw one ball, guys.

01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:28.256
It's your whole shoulder,
your whole body...

01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:29.536
Aim for his balls.
He's wearin' a cup.

01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:30.936
See, that's a little...
that's a little better.

01:39:30.960 --> 01:39:32.016
Just... Now how about
you throw that over the plate?

01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:33.439
Here we go.

01:39:33.520 --> 01:39:35.829
Oh, Jesus Christ!
That's terrible.

01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:38.388
Thirty-seven thousand fans
are gonna be booin' your ass.

01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:40.152
You're all messed up,
all right?

01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:41.696
So listen to me.

01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:43.597
Just listen. All right?

01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:45.716
You're a bunch
of fuckin' disasters.

01:39:45.800 --> 01:39:47.279
Jesus.

01:39:47.360 --> 01:39:48.520
You got that right.

01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:50.437
But I wouldn't trade ya in
for anything.

01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:52.670
So just do me a favor,
all right?

01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:54.435
Help me out?

01:39:55.680 --> 01:39:56.840
- All right?
- Let's go. Okay.

01:39:58.280 --> 01:39:59.376
Come on, buddy,
muscle memory.

01:39:59.400 --> 01:40:01.038
You know how to do this.

01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:02.896
And now it's just about
healing, getting better,

01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:05.753
and showin ' the world
I'm fine and that, y'know,

01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:07.376
I'm not gonna let this
hold me down, y'know,

01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:09.550
'cause then
maybe if they see that,

01:40:09.640 --> 01:40:12.712
then maybe they won't let
stuff hold them down, either.

01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:16.349
And, y'know, there's always
gonna be pain, I think,

01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:19.512
y'know, but, I dunno, I just

01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:21.511
wanna, like...

01:40:24.600 --> 01:40:26.033
...live.

01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:41.716
...the Marathon tragedy,

01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:43.711
was a man in a cowboy hat

01:40:43.800 --> 01:40:46.633
rescuing a severely
injured man.

01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:49.837
The man in the cowboy hat
had lost one son...

01:40:56.080 --> 01:40:58.435
How you feelin', Carlos?

01:40:58.520 --> 01:41:00.476
A little nervous.

01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:01.754
Yeah.

01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:03.592
My hands are shakin'.

01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:06.670
My boys would have loved this.

01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:24.916
- Hey, Carlos.
- Yeah?

01:41:27.320 --> 01:41:29.197
I'm gonna be a father.

01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:33.190
That's wonderful.

01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:40.073
It's time, Jeff.

01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:41.752
- Ready?
- Yeah.

01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:55.431
A hero and his hero,
right?

01:42:33.720 --> 01:42:34.869
How are you?

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:36.035
- Good.
- I'm Jackie.

01:42:36.120 --> 01:42:37.348
How are you, Jackie? Jeff.

01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:38.714
Jeff, nice to meet you.

01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:40.279
So nice to have you here.

01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:41.554
Nice to meet you, Carlos.

01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:43.440
All right,
so we're gonna walk you out

01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:44.696
right in front of the mound and...
sound good?

01:42:44.720 --> 01:42:46.199
- All right.
- All right, let's go.

01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:47.280
Been practicing?

01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:48.360
Yeah.

01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:52.237
Go, Bauman!

01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:11.835
Your boy's on the TV.

01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:13.096
There he is,
there he is.

01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:25.234
Oh, wow.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:30.399
Here comes the ball now.

01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:33.358
That's a special ball.

01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:40.278
Hi, I'm Pedro Martinez.

01:43:40.400 --> 01:43:41.576
I think I know
who you are.

01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:42.919
Oh, great.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:44.558
- How you doing?
- I'm good.

01:43:44.640 --> 01:43:45.993
You're very brave,
you know?

01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:47.149
We're all proud of you.

01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:48.315
Thank you.

01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:49.833
Here.

01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:52.798
You gotta show me
how to do a circle changeup.

01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:54.916
Well...

01:43:55.040 --> 01:43:56.678
Go, Bauman!

01:43:56.760 --> 01:43:58.876
Yeah! Whoo!

01:44:03.240 --> 01:44:04.992
All right, you got any tips?

01:44:05.080 --> 01:44:06.229
Well, aim high.

01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:07.878
You're gonna be
all right, kid.

01:44:07.960 --> 01:44:08.960
All right.

01:44:49.040 --> 01:44:50.837
How did you get so good?

01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:54.356
Let's go!

01:45:00.120 --> 01:45:01.400
He was good under pressure.

01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:02.760
You've gotta give it to him.

01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:04.518
All right?
You've gotta give it to him.

01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:06.016
- He is under pressure.
- There's a lot...

01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:07.632
a lot of people watching that.

01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:16.674
Both Carlos and Jeff have gigantic smiles

01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:18.273
from ear to ear
on their faces.

01:45:18.360 --> 01:45:21.193
What a... what a great moment.

01:45:21.280 --> 01:45:23.077
See those guys coming out,

01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:25.276
you know, everybody
cheering and clapping,

01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:27.954
actually, you know,
I got goose bumps.

01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:29.439
I got chills. So emotional.

01:45:29.520 --> 01:45:31.351
The fans were on their feet.

01:45:31.440 --> 01:45:33.510
Wonderful tribute
by the Red Sox.

01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:34.936
- It was a nice pitch.
- It was on the corner.

01:45:34.960 --> 01:45:36.075
Thanks...

01:45:36.160 --> 01:45:37.256
Either way,
I'll still buy you a beer.

01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:39.635
- I'll still get you a beer.
- No, it wasn't. It was on...

01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:41.517
So I try and do
a circle changeup.

01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:43.136
- How you doin', man?
- Did Pedro show it to you?

01:45:43.160 --> 01:45:44.416
Way to go, Jeff.
That was awesome.

01:45:44.440 --> 01:45:45.696
Hey, maybe
we should turn around.

01:45:45.720 --> 01:45:47.153
Thank you.

01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:48.776
All right, watch the shoulder.
That's his throwin' arm. Careful.

01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:50.756
I know. Careful, I gotta
protect my throwin' arm.

01:45:50.840 --> 01:45:51.875
Got a career ahead.

01:45:51.960 --> 01:45:53.056
Hey, don't pat
the throwin' arm, man.

01:45:53.080 --> 01:45:55.389
Hey! Hey!

01:45:55.480 --> 01:45:57.118
Jeff!
Sounds like you, Sull.

01:45:57.200 --> 01:45:59.430
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:01.556
Whoa, stop.
Can I talk to you for a second, man?

01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:03.376
- What's goin' on here?
- Kind of in a rush.

01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:04.816
Just gimme a second here.
I just wanna talk to him for a second.

01:46:04.840 --> 01:46:06.273
What can I help you with?

01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:09.634
Uh...

01:46:09.720 --> 01:46:11.073
my, um...

01:46:12.080 --> 01:46:13.752
My kid brother, he, uh,

01:46:13.840 --> 01:46:15.717
was in the Marines, uh...

01:46:15.800 --> 01:46:17.631
you know, over in the war.

01:46:17.720 --> 01:46:20.678
And about five years ago,
he got hit with an IED.

01:46:20.760 --> 01:46:22.637
He's gone, man.

01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:23.994
But, uh...

01:46:24.080 --> 01:46:25.308
Sorry about that, man.

01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:26.998
Yeah.

01:46:27.080 --> 01:46:29.310
You know, I saw
your picture that morning.

01:46:29.400 --> 01:46:31.516
You know, after the bomb?

01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:34.558
All I could think about
was Thomas.

01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:35.868
Just lyin' there in the dirt.

01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:38.758

01:46:38.840 --> 01:46:40.831
But seein' you

they can't fuckin' break us

01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:47.269
no matter what
the hell they do.

01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:48.918
Y'know, it...
it gave me a little hope,

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:50.616

and I just wanna say

01:46:50.640 --> 01:46:52.360
fuckin' thank you for that,
man, that's all.

01:46:54.920 --> 01:46:55.989

01:46:56.080 --> 01:46:57.877
Uh, my name's Larry, uh...

01:46:59.200 --> 01:47:01.998

Just wanna
share this with you...

01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:03.230
2009,
I ran the Boston Marathon...

01:48:03.320 --> 01:48:05.595
The 89th floor
of the South Tower, but...

01:48:05.680 --> 01:48:07.336
...and I remember
going through that...

01:48:07.360 --> 01:48:09.590
...confirmed there were
77 people on that floor,

01:48:09.680 --> 01:48:11.432
67 died.

01:48:15.200 --> 01:48:17.555
The only reason
they got out was because...

01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:37.679
All right.

01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:04.039
Y'know, I did the best I could

01:49:04.120 --> 01:49:05.633
with what I had.

01:49:05.720 --> 01:49:07.119
You did all right, Ma.

01:49:07.200 --> 01:49:09.998
And l... I just wish
I'd done better for ya.

01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:11.798
You did all right, Ma.

01:49:15.760 --> 01:49:17.910
You're gonna be
a wonderful father.

01:49:22.040 --> 01:49:24.031
All right.

01:49:45.880 --> 01:49:47.438
You're all right there,
Jeffie.

01:49:51.640 --> 01:49:52.959
