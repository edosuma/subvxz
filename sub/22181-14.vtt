00:01.697 --> 00:03.960
[Kara] My name is Kara Zor-El.
I'm from Krypton.

00:04.395 --> 00:06.528
I'm a refugee on this planet.

00:06.571 --> 00:09.009
I was sent to earth
to protect my cousin.

00:09.357 --> 00:11.185
But my pod got knocked
off course.

00:11.228 --> 00:12.925
And by the time I got here,

00:12.969 --> 00:16.407
my cousin had already
grown up and become...
Superman.

00:17.582 --> 00:19.845
I hid who I really was
until one day

00:19.889 --> 00:23.240
when an accident forced me
to reveal myself to the world.

00:23.588 --> 00:27.201
To most people,
I'm a reporter at
CatCo Worldwide Media.

00:27.244 --> 00:29.899
But in secret I work
with my adopted sister

00:29.942 --> 00:32.728
for the DEO to protect
my city from alien life

00:32.771 --> 00:35.078
and anyone else that means
to cause it harm.

00:36.253 --> 00:38.516
I am Supergirl.

00:40.127 --> 00:42.085
[Kara]
Previously onSupergirl...

00:42.129 --> 00:43.782
I really like you,
Lena Luthor.

00:45.436 --> 00:47.134
[J'onn J'onzz] I never thought
I'd see you again, Father.

00:47.438 --> 00:50.050
We could make this our home,
if you'd like.

00:50.093 --> 00:52.443
I would like that. Very much.

00:53.401 --> 00:56.143
I haven't been completely
honest with you.

00:56.186 --> 00:57.796
It's time for me
to tell you the truth

00:57.840 --> 00:59.015
about why we're really here.

01:00.277 --> 01:02.062
[reporter]
The criminal known as Toyman

01:02.105 --> 01:05.369
escaped from maximum security
prison this morning.

01:05.761 --> 01:08.938
I am nothing like you.

01:08.981 --> 01:11.549
Don't underestimate yourself.

01:14.030 --> 01:15.727
I know some of you are scared.

01:17.251 --> 01:19.427
I know some of you have never
done this before.

01:21.037 --> 01:22.169
I know some of you are ready

01:22.212 --> 01:24.040
to get out there
and prove yourselves.

01:25.868 --> 01:27.609
But just remember why
we do this.

03:12.017 --> 03:15.804
No, it's kinetic. She moves
stuff, not reads minds.

03:15.847 --> 03:17.762
That's kind of a cool
party trick.

03:17.806 --> 03:18.981
Can she move you?

03:19.590 --> 03:20.591
[both chuckle]

03:21.853 --> 03:23.377
Yeah, she's, uh...
She's pretty impressive.

03:23.420 --> 03:24.900
Well, she's gotta be.

03:25.857 --> 03:27.424
You never were into

You know, work is work.

03:38.087 --> 03:39.567
No, not really.

Why are you checking
your phone every
15 seconds then?

03:42.961 --> 03:44.354
[chuckles]

03:45.442 --> 03:46.487
Fair point.

03:48.097 --> 03:49.141
-Yeah, there's somebody.
-Hmm?

03:49.620 --> 03:51.056
But we haven't, like,
you know,

03:51.448 --> 03:53.450

what we're doing yet, so...

-You happy?
-Working on it.

03:58.977 --> 04:00.152

-[all cheering]

04:04.244 --> 04:06.637
I gotta pick a song.
Come on, come on, help me.

04:08.813 --> 04:10.815
See, I told you, you had
nothing to worry about.

04:11.120 --> 04:13.862
Karaoke is not for the weak.

04:13.905 --> 04:17.953
It requires either great
courage or a complete
lack of shame.

04:17.996 --> 04:19.433
But I like it.

04:19.694 --> 04:21.173
You do a killer rock star.

04:21.217 --> 04:24.916
I listen to it sometimes
while I look after
the apartment.

04:24.960 --> 04:28.050
Oh, yes, yes.
You have a stunning apartment,

04:28.093 --> 04:30.139
that I haven't been invited
to yet.

04:31.358 --> 04:32.620
Oh, we're still getting it
together.

04:32.663 --> 04:34.535
It's been three months.

04:34.578 --> 04:36.493
Okay, I think it's time
for a housewarming party.

04:36.537 --> 04:38.495
-I don't think so.
-Yes.

04:38.539 --> 04:40.671
The house's temperature
is quite comfortable.

04:45.197 --> 04:46.721
Well, we could do dinner.

04:49.027 --> 04:50.812
If you have this number
you must be important.

04:50.855 --> 04:52.335
Hey, you, it's me.

04:52.379 --> 04:54.816
Uh, just checkin' on you,
seeing how busy you are.

04:55.556 --> 04:59.473
Maybe, uh, you're interested
in a hand-delivered
dinner tonight.

04:59.516 --> 05:00.865
Give me a call. Bye.

05:02.519 --> 05:06.349

Yes, that's the one.
Here we go.

-It's gonna be so good. Hi.

05:08.308 --> 05:11.180
Hey, can we talk real quick?
It's, uh, kind of important.

05:11.223 --> 05:12.660
Yeah, yeah. Of course.
In a second.

our faces off.
-Right.

Hey, I'm okay. It's okay.
Just...

05:59.924 --> 06:02.927
Do you mind if I stay out here
for a second with you?

06:05.626 --> 06:07.628
Like, he's just gone, right?
That's all.

06:07.976 --> 06:10.500
I mean, it's not like
anything's gonna change.

06:10.544 --> 06:13.460
I never talked to him,
I never saw him, I...

06:14.548 --> 06:16.245
That doesn't mean you never
felt him.

06:16.288 --> 06:18.073
What's that... I'm supposed
to be feeling something,
right?

06:18.116 --> 06:20.945
I don't feel anything.

06:22.120 --> 06:23.295
I don't think. Um...

06:26.473 --> 06:27.952
Just go inside.

06:32.783 --> 06:34.306
I'm not going back in.

06:35.960 --> 06:37.353
Okay.

[theme music playing]

06:45.143 --> 06:47.058
Winslow Schott, Sr.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.148
was a man with many demons.

06:51.323 --> 06:53.935
As we lay him to rest,
we may not celebrate his life,

06:53.978 --> 06:55.327
but we can examine it,

06:56.851 --> 06:58.330
and perhaps forgive a troubled
soul its transgressions.

06:58.940 --> 07:01.333
Would anyone care to speak
on behalf of the deceased?

07:30.841 --> 07:32.147

07:35.455 --> 07:37.500
Do you recognize me?
It's been a while.

07:39.023 --> 07:40.372
I know how long it's been.

07:44.986 --> 07:46.335
You just missed him.

07:46.683 --> 07:49.338
Oh, I wouldn't say that.
I never missed him.

07:50.905 --> 07:52.472
I'm not here for him.

07:54.082 --> 07:55.475
Oh, so you're here for me?

07:56.867 --> 07:58.652
Wow, Mom, it's a little late.

to be furious with me.

I hate to ask, but I have to.

08:51.879 --> 08:53.533
He's dead, Kara.

08:53.576 --> 08:54.795
-Are you sure?
-He's dead.

08:54.838 --> 08:56.274
Look, I had the warden

08:56.318 --> 08:58.886
and two separate medical
examiners sign off
on the body.

08:58.929 --> 09:01.236
I had them cross-check his
dental records

09:01.279 --> 09:02.933
and his fingerprints,
just to be sure.

09:02.977 --> 09:05.153
The dude in the box
was my father.

09:05.196 --> 09:06.415
Okay?

09:06.458 --> 09:08.635
So why blow himself up
at his own funeral?

09:09.113 --> 09:10.550
Maybe for the headline.

09:11.376 --> 09:13.640
Yeah. "Toyman's last trick."

09:13.683 --> 09:15.119
Sounds about right.

09:15.163 --> 09:16.860
I still think we should run
a full mass spectrometry

09:16.904 --> 09:18.166
on the explosive residue,
Winn.

09:18.688 --> 09:19.950
It may tell us who's helping
your father.

09:19.994 --> 09:21.604
No one is helping him!

09:21.648 --> 09:23.519
Seriously, he was a
crazy person.

09:23.737 --> 09:27.131
Crazy people do crazy things.

Well, I'm happy to report that
Mary has a clean bill
of health.

She wants to talk to you.

09:36.358 --> 09:37.968

to talk to me.

ten of your Earth dollars?

the deliveryman when
he entered the lobby,

having dinner with
Alex and Kara.

the ingredients earlier on.

I'd been lying.

about a lot of stuff.

[Mary sighs]

12:26.833 --> 12:29.270
I just wanted to see
your face, Winn.

12:29.313 --> 12:32.926
I wanted to hear your voice,
I wanted my son back.

12:35.189 --> 12:40.020
I have spent 20 years
imagining this moment
and now I...

12:43.284 --> 12:45.329
Leaving you, it gutted me.

12:45.373 --> 12:47.549
And I've carried that with me
every day of my life,

12:47.592 --> 12:50.770
but I had to, Winn,
because your father--

12:50.813 --> 12:52.772
Oh, no, I'm sorry,
let me guess.

12:53.337 --> 12:54.643
He threatened your life.

12:54.686 --> 12:58.516
No, Winn. He threatened yours.

12:59.474 --> 13:03.608
He told me that if I
went near you, ever,

13:04.174 --> 13:05.523
that he would kill you.

13:06.002 --> 13:07.961
And when he died,
I thought it was safe.

13:08.004 --> 13:10.224
But I was wrong.
You're still in danger.

13:10.267 --> 13:11.573
I don't believe you.

13:12.879 --> 13:14.968
You saw what your father did
at his own funeral.

13:15.011 --> 13:17.361
I saw the last
grasping prank of a lunatic.

13:19.363 --> 13:22.192
And now, what I'm hearing
is an excuse.

13:22.889 --> 13:24.455
Twenty years in the making.

13:24.499 --> 13:27.197
[scoffs]
Hey, I had 20 years
to think, too.

13:29.983 --> 13:31.854
You want to know what I think
about the most?

13:33.334 --> 13:35.031
Let me set the scene for you.

13:36.206 --> 13:38.252
It's the night Dad finally
snapped.

13:38.600 --> 13:41.690
And I'm sitting
in the police station,
freezing cold,

13:41.733 --> 13:43.083
because I'm in my pajamas.

13:43.126 --> 13:45.563
When the police came
and picked me up from home,

13:45.607 --> 13:46.869
I was asleep.

13:46.913 --> 13:48.958
Remember? In bed. Alone.

13:50.438 --> 13:54.572
And the nice officer,
he drapes the coat
over my shoulders.

13:55.399 --> 13:56.574
I feel a little better.

13:56.879 --> 13:58.402
So I'm sitting there,

14:00.230 --> 14:02.842
and my cold little feet are
dangling in the air,
and I'm waiting.

14:05.235 --> 14:10.762
I'm waiting for my mom
to pick me up.

14:12.764 --> 14:15.637
'Cause they said that
they called you. Yeah.

14:16.203 --> 14:18.770
Yeah, they said it was just
gonna be like an hour,

14:19.119 --> 14:21.904
and then they'd explain
everything.

14:22.470 --> 14:24.428
And then it was two hours.

14:24.994 --> 14:27.257
And then it was
the next morning.

14:30.957 --> 14:32.741
When I lie in bed at night,

14:33.960 --> 14:35.918
staring up at the ceiling,
unable to sleep,

14:35.962 --> 14:39.704
I'm not wondering why Dad
finally, suddenly snapped.

14:39.748 --> 14:42.272
No, that doesn't haunt me.
What haunts me is you.

14:43.099 --> 14:45.362
You, who left me,

14:46.276 --> 14:48.452
when I needed you the most.

14:48.496 --> 14:50.150
With no explanation,

14:50.802 --> 14:52.456
no goodbye.

14:53.631 --> 14:54.937
I'm so sorry.

14:54.981 --> 14:56.417
I don't care anymore.

14:57.070 --> 14:59.376
-Winn--
-I don't need your excuses.

14:59.681 --> 15:01.813
You wanna keep me safe? Great.

15:02.814 --> 15:05.469
You know what you should do?
Leave again!

15:09.256 --> 15:11.388
[indistinct chatter]

15:13.260 --> 15:14.478
Something's happening.

15:19.483 --> 15:22.704
-What the hell is that?
-It's a message. For me.

15:28.014 --> 15:29.363
Is that a wicked witch?

15:29.624 --> 15:33.280
No. Is it flying monkeys?

15:39.199 --> 15:40.200
[monkeys screeching]

15:43.855 --> 15:45.683
I'll take the big one,
you take the little ones.

15:46.032 --> 15:47.772
I am so happy
I don't work here.

15:52.168 --> 15:53.996
Quickly!
Under the desks.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.563
-Come on!
-What are you doing?

15:55.606 --> 15:58.827
-We've gotta stay down--
-This is my job, Mom!

16:28.900 --> 16:31.294
Oh! You came for me.

16:36.125 --> 16:37.431
Mom!

16:38.562 --> 16:41.217
Get away from him,
you nightmare.

17:04.719 --> 17:05.720
[grunts]

17:06.547 --> 17:07.548
[alarm blaring]

17:07.591 --> 17:09.724
This is your job?

17:10.246 --> 17:11.552
This is?

17:14.424 --> 17:16.600
Okay. Well, keep me posted.

17:16.992 --> 17:18.037
Problem?

17:18.080 --> 17:19.908
Oh, there was
a minor kerfuffle,

17:19.951 --> 17:22.998
but, uh, no one was hurt
and Kara's got it handled,

17:23.042 --> 17:24.739
so you just keep relaxing.

17:24.782 --> 17:25.957
[chuckles]

17:26.001 --> 17:29.091
So, some of that
old time rock 'n' roll, huh?

17:29.135 --> 17:32.355
That was an epic karaoke
performance.

17:33.791 --> 17:35.315
Indeed.

17:35.967 --> 17:37.839
But a problematic genre.

17:38.187 --> 17:39.797
-Been on the Internet?
-Yes.

17:40.146 --> 17:43.671
Many of the pioneers
of rock 'n' roll were humans
of color who

17:43.714 --> 17:47.283
did not receive the fame
or fortune their white
counterparts did.

17:48.154 --> 17:49.764
Have you faced many challenges

17:49.807 --> 17:51.940
in your human form
since you've been here?

17:51.983 --> 17:55.726
No. My relative isolation
has its silver linings.

17:55.770 --> 17:59.904
My son has found goodhearted
friends in his time
on this planet.

18:00.601 --> 18:02.342
You all treat me like family.

18:03.125 --> 18:05.606
You've chosen to live
as a black man in America,

18:05.649 --> 18:08.870
which is a harder existence,
in and of itself.

18:09.349 --> 18:11.264
-Why?
-You know, I was...

18:11.307 --> 18:13.788
I was forced to become
Hank Henshaw
out of desperation,

18:13.831 --> 18:15.790
but now I choose this face.

18:16.269 --> 18:17.357
I like it.

18:17.792 --> 18:19.402
And I wouldn't want
to live in a world

18:19.446 --> 18:21.274
where I need to change
the color of my skin
to feel safe,

18:21.317 --> 18:24.973
to feel seen, to feel like
I'm not a target.

18:25.408 --> 18:26.931
I'd rather change the world.

18:27.497 --> 18:31.110
And whatever my son's fight
may be, I choose it as well.

18:31.980 --> 18:33.634
And I have your backs.

18:33.677 --> 18:36.071
-Let's drink to that.
-Cheers.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.116
[all chuckle]

18:38.160 --> 18:39.118
Mmm.

18:40.467 --> 18:42.686
Alex, you need more...

18:48.866 --> 18:50.346
"Wine," Dad.

18:50.390 --> 18:51.956
Your English is fantastic,

18:52.000 --> 18:53.784
-don't worry about the
occasional slip-up.
-[chuckles]

18:53.828 --> 18:55.177
I'll go get some more wine.

18:57.092 --> 19:00.095
I hope you still have room.
J'onn has made chocolate pie
for dessert.

19:02.358 --> 19:06.362
Well, your mom's right.
Somebody is definitely
helping your dad out.

19:07.537 --> 19:09.757
I just honestly
just wish she would leave.

19:09.800 --> 19:12.455
Like, who the hell does
she think she is anyway, huh?

19:12.499 --> 19:15.937
Like, she just doesn't get
to walk back into my life
after 20 years.

19:16.807 --> 19:18.940
I did not get a say
in her walking out.

19:18.983 --> 19:21.682
I definitely get a say
in her walking back in.

19:23.988 --> 19:25.642
-It's a fair point.
-Yeah.

19:28.645 --> 19:30.256
You think that I should?

19:31.126 --> 19:34.999
No! Dude, no.
Don't think that I should.

19:35.043 --> 19:36.305
Brother, it doesn't matter
what I think,

19:36.349 --> 19:37.567
it matters what you need.

19:38.568 --> 19:40.657
You know what?
Even if, even if

19:41.092 --> 19:42.790
my dad had threatened
to kill me,

19:42.833 --> 19:44.835
she could have done
a thousand other things.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.663
Gone to the police, the FBI.

19:46.707 --> 19:49.710
No. Instead, she decided
to abandon me.

19:50.276 --> 19:52.234
And you know what? She has to
deal with the consequences.

19:54.018 --> 19:55.759
You know,
if she'd have stayed,

19:57.239 --> 19:59.241
then, maybe, you know,
we could have had a...

20:00.199 --> 20:02.462
You know,
a great relationship.

20:02.766 --> 20:04.638
Let me stop you right there.

20:04.681 --> 20:08.207
That is a dangerous
thought exercise designed
purely just to piss you off.

20:20.784 --> 20:22.133
When my dad died,

20:24.179 --> 20:27.704
my mom did everything
for me and my sister.

20:28.444 --> 20:30.229
She worked night and day,
she busted her ass,

20:30.751 --> 20:32.970
and I still blamed her.

20:34.972 --> 20:36.757
Because she was the only one
there.

20:38.889 --> 20:40.239
And that was rough.

20:41.805 --> 20:43.633
We got over it, though.
You know,

20:43.981 --> 20:46.767
took a long time,
and a lot of forgiveness,

20:46.810 --> 20:50.118
and me taking responsibility
for my part in that.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.948
You can't change
what happened,

20:54.383 --> 20:55.906
but she's here now.

20:57.343 --> 20:59.170
It's up to you what you wanna
do with that.

21:12.183 --> 21:14.969
I always knew he was brilliant
and capable,

21:15.012 --> 21:18.189
but I worried when I left that
he'd go the same way
his dad did.

21:18.233 --> 21:19.495
He worried about that, too.

21:19.539 --> 21:20.888
I should have been here
to tell him

21:20.931 --> 21:23.325
that he and his father
were worlds apart.

21:24.326 --> 21:25.980
Did his friends tell him?

21:26.023 --> 21:27.286
We did.

21:27.764 --> 21:30.027
-Thank you for that.
-Well, it was easy.

21:31.377 --> 21:36.469
He doesn't always get
the credit, but he keeps us
going around here.

21:37.296 --> 21:39.341
He's always the one
with some crazy idea

21:39.385 --> 21:42.039
that no one else
would possibly dream of.

21:43.693 --> 21:45.434
My son works with Supergirl.

21:45.478 --> 21:49.308
It's just such a relief.
He saves lives.

21:49.699 --> 21:52.963
I just wish he'd let me
tell him how proud I am
of him.

21:54.008 --> 21:55.357
I think he will.

21:55.792 --> 21:57.228
Eventually.

21:58.708 --> 21:59.927
Sorry about the mess.

21:59.970 --> 22:02.538
Oh, this? This is...
That's not your fault.

22:04.148 --> 22:07.413
Can I ask, uh, when it comes
to your day-to-day,

22:07.848 --> 22:09.545
on a scale of one to ten,

22:09.980 --> 22:12.635
how big of a pain in the ass
are flying monkeys?

22:12.679 --> 22:14.768
-Maybe a two.
-Oh.

22:15.551 --> 22:17.379
-Does that make you
feel better?
-Yes.

22:17.423 --> 22:18.946
-Very much so.
-Good.

22:22.428 --> 22:23.516
[both chuckling]

22:23.559 --> 22:24.995
[J'onn J'onzz]
Pie in three minutes.

22:25.387 --> 22:26.693
Okay.

22:30.087 --> 22:31.567
Well, thank you for having me
tonight.

22:31.828 --> 22:34.048
The place looks wonderful.

22:34.091 --> 22:35.571
Oh, the pleasure was mine.

22:36.485 --> 22:38.618
You mean a great deal
to J'onn.

22:39.140 --> 22:41.272
Well, he's very important
to me, too.

22:41.577 --> 22:43.579
I know we are new friends,

22:43.623 --> 22:45.407
but I hope, in time,

22:45.451 --> 22:49.455
that we can be
the kind of family
you and J'onn have become.

22:50.804 --> 22:52.153
That would be lovely.

22:52.588 --> 22:55.069
I have always wanted
a granddaughter.

22:57.201 --> 22:59.856
You mean besides
K'hym and T'ania?

23:00.117 --> 23:01.380
Who?

23:02.293 --> 23:03.773
Your granddaughters.

23:10.998 --> 23:14.436
My grandmother was
a music lover as well.

23:14.480 --> 23:16.395
Especially later in her life.

23:16.786 --> 23:19.136
It just seemed to always
give her that extra spark.

23:20.050 --> 23:22.488
Even when she started
forgetting things.

23:23.097 --> 23:26.274
Like, little things at first.
It was just words,

23:26.317 --> 23:28.319
you know, why she'd walk
into a room,

23:28.972 --> 23:30.626
and eventually,

23:31.105 --> 23:32.323
people.

23:34.238 --> 23:37.241
I think you might
be exhibiting
similar symptoms.

23:37.285 --> 23:38.721
Please don't tell him.

23:39.113 --> 23:42.638
-You already knew?
-On Mars we called it Za-alet.

23:43.378 --> 23:46.642
Translated roughly,
it means "decay of memory."

23:47.861 --> 23:48.949
Dementia.

23:48.992 --> 23:50.994
I am losing myself.

23:52.866 --> 23:54.737
As it progresses,
you're gonna need help.

23:54.781 --> 23:56.696
He has helped me enough.

23:56.739 --> 23:58.306
No, you're gonna need more
than that.

23:58.349 --> 24:01.265
Because you could
hurt yourself or others.

24:01.701 --> 24:02.789
You have to tell him.

24:02.832 --> 24:04.704
He just got me back,

24:04.747 --> 24:08.751
I can't ask him to watch me
disappear inch by inch.
It's too cruel.

24:08.795 --> 24:10.405
Well, that could happen,
no matter what.

24:10.971 --> 24:12.973
So, the sooner you tell him,

24:13.277 --> 24:15.018
the sooner he can get help.

24:15.802 --> 24:18.239
I'm sorry, Myr'nn,
but if he asks me,

24:18.282 --> 24:20.415
I mean, I don't think
I could lie to him.

24:20.459 --> 24:22.156
You will say nothing!

24:22.722 --> 24:24.637
He is my son.

24:24.680 --> 24:26.987
And I choose how best
to protect him, not you.

24:27.030 --> 24:29.119
-I'm sorry, I didn't mean--
-Get out.

24:29.772 --> 24:31.644
Get out of my house.

24:31.687 --> 24:34.211
[J'onn J'onzz] Dad,
everything okay
out there?

24:36.126 --> 24:37.127
[door closes]

24:38.128 --> 24:39.347
What happened?

24:47.224 --> 24:49.531
Ah! [groans]

24:49.575 --> 24:52.186
That is an angry
monkey corpse.

24:52.229 --> 24:54.144
I was hoping to access
this thing's inner workings,

24:54.188 --> 24:56.364
but it's like a
game of Operation.

24:56.407 --> 24:59.933
Every time I get close
to cracking it,
it just zaps me.

24:59.976 --> 25:01.761
Can I try? I love Operation.

25:02.022 --> 25:04.285
I'm not sure if you noticed,

25:04.328 --> 25:07.593
but it's, like, a top-secret
government facility in here.

25:07.636 --> 25:09.029
Oh, nobody cares.

25:09.072 --> 25:11.292
Are you paid enough to care?
No, of course not.

25:11.335 --> 25:14.295
-You should unionize,
by the way.
-Mom, that's...

25:14.338 --> 25:16.776
Did I ever tell you I was once
your father's apprentice?

25:17.428 --> 25:19.126
I thought you two met
in Ivy Town.

25:19.169 --> 25:21.607
Uh, we were
both students, yes,
but that's not where we met.

25:21.650 --> 25:23.696
I kept the books
at the local toy store

25:23.739 --> 25:26.699
and your father
was the genius stock boy.

25:26.742 --> 25:30.703
And he taught me about
the math in the machine.

25:30.746 --> 25:33.575
One and one is two,
it's simple, it's elegant.

25:33.619 --> 25:35.359
It's clean.

25:35.403 --> 25:37.274
Just like a wind-up toy.

25:37.840 --> 25:39.581
Your father's mind was
a wind-up toy.

25:39.625 --> 25:41.452
I know what made it tick.

25:42.236 --> 25:43.759
So then you knew how
to stop him

25:43.803 --> 25:46.762
from, uh, going crazy
and killing a bunch of people.

25:48.547 --> 25:49.548
[sighs]

25:51.332 --> 25:55.249
Um, do you remember when
I took you to Disneyland
when you were nine?

25:55.292 --> 25:57.817
Do I remember?
Yeah, we drove overnight,

25:57.860 --> 26:00.123
'cause you wanted to be there
the second it opened.

26:00.167 --> 26:02.909
And then we get into
a car accident at 2:00 a.m.
in the morning

26:02.952 --> 26:05.041
and Dad has to come and
pick us up and takes us home.

26:05.085 --> 26:07.304
We never actually went
to Disneyland.

26:07.348 --> 26:10.046
No. We were never going there.

26:10.743 --> 26:13.572
We were going
to a domestic-abuse shelter.

26:15.530 --> 26:17.401
And he ran us off the road.

26:18.446 --> 26:20.927
Stole a car, sped down
the highway,

26:20.970 --> 26:22.450
ran us into a ditch.

26:22.493 --> 26:26.628
You sat dazed in the backseat
with a concussion,

26:26.672 --> 26:29.892
and he and I had it out
on the shoulder
of the interstate.

26:29.936 --> 26:33.635
That's the night that
he threatened to kill you,
his only son,

26:33.679 --> 26:36.029
just to hurt me.

26:39.815 --> 26:43.079
Your father didn't just
go to bed normal

26:43.123 --> 26:45.647
and wake up the next morning
a monster.

26:45.691 --> 26:48.302
He was paranoid,
he was controlling,

26:48.345 --> 26:51.044
he... He was mean.

26:53.263 --> 26:54.656
I never saw it.

26:54.700 --> 26:56.005
I didn't want you to.

26:58.007 --> 27:00.880
And I'm sorry, Winn.
I'm sorry that...

27:01.184 --> 27:03.404
I couldn't get us out
from under his shadow.

27:04.013 --> 27:05.667
That I couldn't save you.

27:06.276 --> 27:07.800
That's not on you.

27:08.191 --> 27:11.238
Maybe not, but the last
20 years, those were.

27:12.065 --> 27:13.544
And you were right about that.

27:14.458 --> 27:17.026
But I just wanted you
to understand why.

27:22.292 --> 27:23.511
Alex?

27:24.381 --> 27:26.645
-What happened?
-What do you mean?

27:27.820 --> 27:30.518
Did he, um, offend you?

27:30.866 --> 27:32.868
-Say something?
-No. Of course not.

27:32.912 --> 27:34.827
No, your father is wonderful.

27:34.870 --> 27:36.655
So then, what went so wrong?

27:37.743 --> 27:39.658
You know, we were having
such a lovely time.

27:39.875 --> 27:44.010
And now my father has
completely closed himself
off for some reason.

27:45.751 --> 27:46.708
Why?

27:48.754 --> 27:50.669
You're gonna have to
talk to him about it.

27:51.408 --> 27:53.497
It's not my place. I'm sorry.

27:54.368 --> 27:55.674
But, for the record,

27:56.587 --> 27:58.415
I had a lovely time, too.

28:02.202 --> 28:04.030
[Lena on recording]
If you have this number
you must be important.

28:04.073 --> 28:05.596
Yo, it's me again. Uh...

28:07.598 --> 28:08.251
I talked to your assistant,
he said you hadn't checked in,
in a few days

28:08.295 --> 28:09.731
so I just wanted to...

28:10.558 --> 28:12.386
Just give me a call
when you can.

28:13.909 --> 28:16.172
Any luck on figuring out who's
behind the Toyman attacks?

28:16.216 --> 28:19.959
No, but we've discovered
a thousand ways how not
to make a flying monkey.

28:20.002 --> 28:22.875
And also a few ways
to make better flying monkeys.

28:22.918 --> 28:25.704
Oh, the wiring on these
is amateurish at best.

28:25.747 --> 28:28.750
Alas, we are no closer
to finding out
who actually built them.

28:33.276 --> 28:34.625
I could use a break.

28:34.669 --> 28:36.758
I'm gonna head downstairs,
rest for a little bit.

29:11.227 --> 29:13.882
I don't know why
you hate me or my son,

29:13.926 --> 29:16.319
but it stops right here.

29:18.060 --> 29:20.280
I'm pointing a gun at you,
by the way.

29:20.323 --> 29:22.499
In case that's a thing you'd
be interested in knowing.

29:24.023 --> 29:27.287
A gun. That's a dangerous toy.

29:28.331 --> 29:31.465
[clears throat]
But mine are worse.

29:31.508 --> 29:32.509
[whirring]

29:33.206 --> 29:34.207
[screeching]

29:40.648 --> 29:41.867
Have you guys seen my mom?

29:43.520 --> 29:45.261
I thought you two were putting
Humpty Dumpty together again.

29:45.305 --> 29:47.786
No, she's gone. So is the
side panel from the monkey's
gear chamber.

29:49.352 --> 29:51.006
[beeping]

29:51.050 --> 29:53.966
I have your mother, but you
can trade your life for hers.

29:54.009 --> 29:57.317
She's hanging around
at the old
Wiggins Game Company factory.

29:57.360 --> 30:00.146
But hurry, Junior,
the pressure is on.

30:00.189 --> 30:02.148
Winn, don't come here.

30:02.191 --> 30:04.411
-I'll go.
-Me too.

30:04.454 --> 30:05.716
Not without me.

30:06.326 --> 30:07.631
That's exactly what she wants.

30:07.675 --> 30:09.155
I've spent my entire life

30:09.198 --> 30:10.852
trying to fight off the part
of me that's like my dad,

30:10.896 --> 30:13.202
but now, now I can use it.
Let's go.

30:15.552 --> 30:18.338
Hey, Buffalo Bill,
why are you doing this to us?

30:18.381 --> 30:20.166
"Us"? Who's "us"?

30:20.209 --> 30:23.082
The shrew wife who wouldn't
let her husband have any fun?

30:23.125 --> 30:26.694
The son who never wrote,
never called, never visited

30:26.737 --> 30:29.915
his lonely, ailing father
in prison?

30:30.567 --> 30:34.093
You really think you're a pair
worthy of sympathy?

30:34.745 --> 30:36.704
-Or mercy?
-You knew my husband.

30:36.747 --> 30:38.924
I worked maintenance
at the penitentiary.

30:38.967 --> 30:42.405
He was a brilliant,
dedicated man.

30:43.058 --> 30:44.755
A once-in-a-lifetime mind.

30:45.104 --> 30:47.671
He graced me with everything
he knew.

30:48.194 --> 30:51.458
And, in exchange, I promised
to carry out his wishes.

30:52.502 --> 30:53.939
Even after he died.

30:53.982 --> 30:55.766
Oh. So you're his patsy.

30:55.810 --> 30:59.118
His apprentice. His protege.

30:59.901 --> 31:02.773
And the executor
of his final wishes.

31:03.122 --> 31:05.602
To punish you,
if you broke the rules.

31:06.386 --> 31:07.387
[grunts]

31:09.258 --> 31:11.086
I'm gonna kill your son.

31:12.044 --> 31:15.438
I'm gonna make you watch,
just like Winslow wanted.

31:16.962 --> 31:18.746
Then I'm gonna kill you, too.

31:23.185 --> 31:24.273
[James] Any ideas?

31:24.621 --> 31:26.275
[Winn] She was in that
claw apparatus.

31:26.319 --> 31:28.930
-Suspended from above.
-We'll find her.

31:30.105 --> 31:31.106
[buzzing]

31:33.369 --> 31:34.588
What is that?

31:34.980 --> 31:36.242
It's a plane.

31:36.285 --> 31:38.287
No, it's not, it's a bomb.

31:44.685 --> 31:45.947
Go find Mary.

31:55.087 --> 31:56.436
[Jacqueline on speaker]
Welcome, welcome

31:56.479 --> 31:59.395
to the Willard Walter Wiggins
Game Company.

32:05.140 --> 32:06.185
[yells]

32:06.228 --> 32:07.795
We got a thing on our 12.

32:07.838 --> 32:10.232
-That's our six.
-I'm very stressed right now.

32:12.626 --> 32:14.671
Literal Hot Wheels!

32:14.715 --> 32:15.716
[shouts]

32:20.982 --> 32:23.898
[Jacqueline]
So glad Junior brought
his friends.

32:24.551 --> 32:25.856
There she is.

32:29.904 --> 32:34.604
[Jacqueline] Heat vision,
freeze breath, and so many
points of articulation?

32:34.648 --> 32:36.084
I think I'll keep you.

32:41.176 --> 32:44.658
It's so rare to find a vintage
superhero in mint condition.

32:45.659 --> 32:46.965
Supergirl.

32:47.226 --> 32:48.227
-[crackling]
-[gasping]

32:50.925 --> 32:53.058
-[grunts]
-[screeches]

33:07.681 --> 33:08.769
Mom.

33:11.467 --> 33:12.729
Go get her.

33:14.427 --> 33:15.471
I got these.

33:17.169 --> 33:18.213
[gasping]

33:22.043 --> 33:23.523
Kara, I've got you!

33:24.828 --> 33:25.916
[yells]

33:25.960 --> 33:27.048
You okay?

33:34.577 --> 33:35.578
Whoa.

33:58.514 --> 33:59.907
Cloth magic.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.084
Mom!

34:03.128 --> 34:05.043
Turn around and leave
right now!

34:07.567 --> 34:08.698
I'm here to rescue you.

34:09.047 --> 34:10.396
Don't Luke Skywalker me.

34:10.439 --> 34:12.180
This crazy woman is trying
to kill you.

34:12.224 --> 34:13.747
Don't give her the chance.

34:15.444 --> 34:19.666
Well, if it isn't Toyman Jr.
barreling headlong
into danger.

34:20.145 --> 34:22.582
I see your father
left you none of his brains.

34:22.625 --> 34:27.021
Oh, really? 'Cause I see that
he left you none of his
showmanship.

34:27.674 --> 34:29.763
What, after all this
you're just gonna shoot us?

34:29.806 --> 34:32.026
Most important thing
your father taught me,

34:32.070 --> 34:33.375
stick the landing.

34:33.419 --> 34:36.813
Really? Because what I got
was, "More is more."

34:40.165 --> 34:41.122
[yells]

34:48.521 --> 34:49.609
Winn!

34:54.309 --> 34:56.485
Your dad taught me this one,
too.

34:56.964 --> 34:58.270
Did he teach you this?

35:04.014 --> 35:05.015
[groans]

35:07.540 --> 35:09.150
Childish things.

35:09.194 --> 35:11.065
Thank you, Winn. We've got to
get that cleaned out right now

35:11.109 --> 35:12.284
before it gets infected.

35:12.327 --> 35:14.024
When was your last
tetanus shot?

35:14.373 --> 35:17.071
Mom, recently.
I am very cautious.

35:23.469 --> 35:25.123
Oh, hey.

35:30.171 --> 35:33.348
♪ Carry on, my wayward son

35:33.696 --> 35:36.699
♪ There'll be peace when
you are done ♪

35:37.091 --> 35:38.484
This is unfortunate.

35:38.527 --> 35:39.702
Oh, white-boy rock.

35:39.746 --> 35:42.183
Hey, rookie mistake, bud!
It's...

35:43.706 --> 35:46.535
-I'm so proud of you.
-[laughs]

35:46.579 --> 35:48.450
What, for shaming my friends?

35:48.494 --> 35:50.887
No, you came out
from the darkness,

35:51.236 --> 35:53.934
you forged an incredible life
for yourself.

35:53.977 --> 35:56.284
I've spent so many years
worrying

35:56.545 --> 35:58.286
about what had become of you,

35:58.330 --> 36:00.636
what the loss of your father,
what the loss of me
did to you,

36:00.680 --> 36:03.073
and you have not only
survived,

36:03.552 --> 36:05.032
you have excelled.

36:05.075 --> 36:07.774
And I couldn't be happier.

36:08.862 --> 36:12.213
-I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
-[scattered cheers]

36:12.257 --> 36:14.737
-[feedback ringing]
-And now I can leave.

36:17.392 --> 36:18.654
You don't need me.

36:20.003 --> 36:23.746
No. I mean, no, I don't,
but, look, you're here.

36:24.486 --> 36:27.881
Okay? [stammers] And I'd like
us to get to know each other.

36:29.274 --> 36:30.753
I'd like that too, Winn.

36:32.015 --> 36:33.974
Hey, and besides,
you can't leave now.

36:34.017 --> 36:35.323
Why's that?

36:35.367 --> 36:38.718
Uh, because
I am signing us up
for a song.

36:38.761 --> 36:40.763
Winn, please.

36:44.289 --> 36:45.725
So, how bad was that?

36:45.768 --> 36:47.335
That was... Thank you.

36:47.379 --> 36:52.558
I would just say maybe
you should sing Kansas
for yourself

36:52.601 --> 36:54.386
and not for other people.

36:54.429 --> 36:56.039
Yeah, that's good advice.

36:56.083 --> 36:57.563
[laughs]

36:57.867 --> 37:00.653
Yeah, well, I only wanted
to talk to you anyway, so...

37:01.306 --> 37:03.482
Hey. Uh...

37:04.961 --> 37:06.789
I'm really sorry
you're hurting,

37:07.312 --> 37:08.748
that really sucks,

37:09.401 --> 37:11.794
but I can't be the one
to talk to you about this.

37:13.666 --> 37:16.408
It's something you and Imra
have to deal with between
the two of you,

37:16.451 --> 37:20.150
and I don't think she'd like
you talking to me about her.

37:20.455 --> 37:21.891
And, frankly,

37:22.457 --> 37:24.938
it doesn't really feel great
for me.

37:25.939 --> 37:27.332
So...

37:28.158 --> 37:29.421
That's that.

37:31.597 --> 37:32.902
I totally get it.

37:34.426 --> 37:35.470
Really?

37:37.255 --> 37:39.300
But, just so you know,
I wasn't actually gonna
talk about Imra.

37:39.344 --> 37:40.693
I mean, not about my feelings.

37:40.736 --> 37:42.782
But I felt like you needed
to know what she did,

37:42.825 --> 37:45.698
and why she did it, 'cause
it directly affects you.

37:48.788 --> 37:50.790
The Legion didn't land here
by accident.

37:50.833 --> 37:53.140
Wait, I thought you hit
a disruption.

37:53.183 --> 37:56.404
Yeah, we did, but Brainy
and Imra hit it intentionally.

37:57.362 --> 37:59.146
And they hid the real mission
from me

37:59.189 --> 38:02.149
because they didn't trust that
I'd wanna come back
to this time.

38:02.628 --> 38:04.064
What's the mission?

38:05.370 --> 38:06.849
Well, the third Worldkiller,

38:07.589 --> 38:09.330
the one you haven't found yet,
Pestilence...

38:11.027 --> 38:13.726
In 1,000 years
she evolves into Blight.

38:16.859 --> 38:18.165
Whoa.

38:18.208 --> 38:20.428
Yeah, so if we can
find her now, in this time,

38:21.386 --> 38:23.866
then we can save everyone,
today and in the future.

38:24.867 --> 38:27.479
And, look, we have
a common enemy now,

38:27.522 --> 38:28.915
so we can work together.

38:28.958 --> 38:30.786
But our common enemy
has been your enemy for years,

38:30.830 --> 38:33.746
so I got a lot
to learn from you.

38:34.486 --> 38:39.229
Like, wait a sec, what...
What was that back there
