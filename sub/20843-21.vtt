Announcer:
<i>Previously on "MasterChef"...</i>

00:03.406 --> 00:07.616
Welcome to the grand finale
of the world's greatest
cooking competition.

00:07.616 --> 00:10.254
<i>the three best</i>
<i>home cooks in America</i>

00:10.254 --> 00:13.360
<i>faced off</i>
<i>over their appetizers.</i>

00:13.360 --> 00:14.796
<i>Dino delivered...</i>

00:14.796 --> 00:16.600
Authentic, flavorful‐‐
I don't want to judge this guy,

00:16.600 --> 00:17.836
I want to hire him.

00:17.836 --> 00:19.438
<i>but Eboni...</i>

00:19.438 --> 00:21.644
My scallops are undercooked.

00:21.644 --> 00:24.448
‐ <i>and Jason...</i>
‐ The custard is broken.

00:24.448 --> 00:26.219
<i>...stumbled.</i>

00:30.360 --> 00:33.233
( cheering )

00:33.233 --> 00:35.304
Two and a half minutes
to go, guys.

00:35.304 --> 00:36.406
Both:
Come on!

00:36.406 --> 00:38.578
Come on, Eb.
Bring it home,
bring it home.

00:38.578 --> 00:42.852
This is gonna be
the closest fought finale in
the history of "MasterChef."

00:42.852 --> 00:44.188
‐ Get your plates out.
‐ Get your plates.

00:44.188 --> 00:46.059
‐ Gotta get those plates.
‐ He's running behind.

00:46.059 --> 00:48.330
Jason, you've got
to start plating.

00:48.330 --> 00:49.833
‐ Let's go, let's go.
‐ Looks beautiful, Dino.

00:49.833 --> 00:52.204
Thank you, baby.

00:52.204 --> 00:55.243
Everyone's plating
except for Jason.

00:55.243 --> 00:57.582
Yachecia:
Come on! Plate!

00:57.582 --> 01:00.253
Daniel:
That's it, Jason.
You've got it.

01:00.253 --> 01:02.391
Gordon:
This is it.

01:02.391 --> 01:04.563
‐ One minute to go!
‐ Come on!

01:04.563 --> 01:05.798
‐ Last minute!
‐ Let's move!

01:05.798 --> 01:07.802
Yachecia:
Guys, let's go!

01:07.802 --> 01:09.205
Christina:
There you go, Eboni.

01:09.205 --> 01:11.042
Tighten up
those dishes, guys.

01:11.042 --> 01:12.411
Make sure
everything's perfect.

01:12.411 --> 01:15.852
Beautiful sauce, Dino.
Baby doll!

01:15.852 --> 01:18.023
‐ Ow!
‐ ( Yachecia laughs )

01:18.023 --> 01:20.595
Gordon:
30 seconds remaining.
Keep it going, Jason.

01:20.595 --> 01:24.035
‐ Cate: Run it in, guys.
‐ Gordon: Finishing touches,
let's go.

01:24.035 --> 01:26.874
Yachecia:
Bring it on home!
Finish it strong!

01:26.874 --> 01:30.715
All:
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

01:30.715 --> 01:34.255
six, five, four, three,

01:34.255 --> 01:37.261
‐ two, one.
‐ Stop!

01:37.261 --> 01:41.302
‐ ( cheering )
‐ Go, Jason!

01:42.471 --> 01:45.912
‐ Yachecia: Yeah!
‐ That one I'm happy about.

01:48.483 --> 01:49.553
Christina:
All right, you three,

01:49.553 --> 01:50.955
it's time for
the moment of truth.

01:52.057 --> 01:56.900
It's time to taste
your entrees.

01:56.900 --> 01:59.573
All three of you, follow us.

01:59.573 --> 02:02.612
( cheering )

02:06.052 --> 02:08.423
‐ Yeah!
‐ Woo!

02:08.423 --> 02:10.060
John:
Looks gorgeous, Jason.

02:18.276 --> 02:20.280
Gordon:
Well done, all three of you.

02:20.280 --> 02:22.317
Now it's time
to taste your entrees.

02:22.317 --> 02:25.390
I think we should
begin with Jason.

02:25.390 --> 02:27.327
‐ Chef Aarón.
‐ Please step forward.

02:27.327 --> 02:29.064
Jason:
<i>I'm really hoping</i>
<i>that the entree round</i>

02:29.064 --> 02:31.435
goes much better for me
than the appetizer round.

02:31.435 --> 02:34.308
<i>I've taken a big risk by</i>
<i>really going out of the box</i>

02:34.308 --> 02:36.279
<i>and trying something original</i>
<i>and unique and creative.</i>

02:36.279 --> 02:38.951
I'm hoping that my gamble
pays off in the entree.

02:38.951 --> 02:40.855
Jason, please
describe the dish.

02:40.855 --> 02:45.197
I've created for you
a tofu skin wrapped black cod

02:45.197 --> 02:47.367
<i>with bay scallops,</i>
<i>maitake mushrooms,</i>

02:47.367 --> 02:50.508
<i>and a cucumber</i>
<i>pea tendril sauce.</i>

02:50.508 --> 02:52.344
This is like I come
back to "MasterChef"

02:52.344 --> 02:54.348
but I'm landing
on another planet, like Mars,

02:54.348 --> 02:56.553
because I don't even know
how to categorize this.

02:56.553 --> 02:58.323
Maybe I'm channeling Dino
a little bit.

02:58.323 --> 03:01.395
Aarón: Maybe you're
channeling Dino.

03:01.395 --> 03:03.333
Jason, I'm intrigued
by this entree.

03:03.333 --> 03:05.504
I think my biggest
question for you is

03:05.504 --> 03:10.681
what purpose does your
broth/sauce serve in the dish?

03:10.681 --> 03:12.952
So, traditionally
at a Chinese meal,

03:12.952 --> 03:14.321
you might have lots
of different entrees,

03:14.321 --> 03:15.791
and I love to have pea stems.

03:15.791 --> 03:17.795
But instead of giving you
a mess of tangled stems,

03:17.795 --> 03:20.668
I decided to concentrate
that flavor of that pea shoot

03:20.668 --> 03:24.542
in with the cucumber
and present it in a slightly
different format

03:24.542 --> 03:26.445
just to play
with the textures there.

03:26.445 --> 03:30.621
Aarón:
Jason, the tofu skin
wrapped black cod,

03:30.621 --> 03:32.525
have you seen this
in a restaurant menu
anywhere in the world?

03:32.525 --> 03:33.894
No, I have not.

03:33.894 --> 03:36.800
So you chose this forum
to be experimental?

03:36.800 --> 03:38.804
Yes, Chef.

03:38.804 --> 03:42.010
Well, I gotta say,
this dish...

03:43.747 --> 03:44.749
is delicious.

03:44.749 --> 03:46.653
Talk about a Cadillac fish.

03:46.653 --> 03:50.828
It's cooked just the way
it should be.

03:50.828 --> 03:52.431
The maitake mushrooms
are meaty.

03:52.431 --> 03:53.667
They're well caramelized.

03:53.667 --> 03:56.439
I think the choices
of scallops

03:56.439 --> 03:59.244
counteracting a very dense,
rich cod,

03:59.244 --> 04:01.382
the idea of something
delicate and soft

04:01.382 --> 04:04.355
and bringing a piece
of Massachusetts to the plate
makes a lot of sense,

04:04.355 --> 04:07.795
‐ and I appreciate that.
‐ Thank you.

04:07.795 --> 04:11.536
‐ Jason, I think
it's fantastic.
‐ Thank you.

04:11.536 --> 04:13.373
The tofu wrapper
totally works.

04:13.373 --> 04:15.210
It gives it texture
and chewiness.

04:15.210 --> 04:18.383
It almost feels
like I'm eating, like,
a pasta dish.

04:18.383 --> 04:22.057
It kind of, like, has
a noodle sensibility to it
when eaten with the cod.

04:22.057 --> 04:24.228
And I think this
is a fantastic dish.

04:24.228 --> 04:26.600
‐ Very, very impressive.
‐ Thank you.

04:26.600 --> 04:31.442
Jason, you took
a really big risk tonight

04:31.442 --> 04:33.279
with your entree.

04:35.183 --> 04:37.622
And I am so glad you did
because I love it.

04:37.622 --> 04:40.193
‐ Thank you.
‐ I think it 100% paid off.

04:40.193 --> 04:44.769
I think that the tofu skin
is different and I like that.

04:44.769 --> 04:47.608
I do think that
it retains the moisture
of the black cod

04:47.608 --> 04:49.979
in a really beautiful,
delicate way.

04:49.979 --> 04:53.052
It is absolutely a Jason dish
and it's incredibly successful.

04:53.052 --> 04:56.492
‐ Thank you. Thank you.
‐ Nice job.

04:56.492 --> 05:01.570
Jason, I said months ago
that you have the technical
skill of a professional chef.

05:01.570 --> 05:03.439
But tonight, you really
( bleep ) confused me.

05:04.876 --> 05:09.418
You wrap an amazing
piece of cod in tofu skin.

05:09.418 --> 05:12.525
You get it crispy.
You season it perfectly.

05:12.525 --> 05:15.798
And then you sit it
in a bath of green water.

05:15.798 --> 05:19.037
Wrapping it once, I think,
was a smart thing to do.

05:19.037 --> 05:22.110
Rolling it two and a half,
three times, is so dangerous,

05:22.110 --> 05:24.214
because once you've got
that crispy skin on the outside,

05:24.214 --> 05:26.285
underneath, it just steeps.

05:26.285 --> 05:27.722
I've got this beautiful color.

05:27.722 --> 05:29.893
Beautifully done color,
color, color.

05:29.893 --> 05:34.434
Then underneath that layer,
I've got this sort of
synthetic texture.

05:34.434 --> 05:36.138
And underneath
the third layer,
it's even more gooey.

05:36.138 --> 05:39.512
You know, the actual fish
is cooked beautifully.

05:39.512 --> 05:41.348
You know,
that's the hero, right?

05:41.348 --> 05:43.654
It's what you've served it in
that disappoints me.

05:43.654 --> 05:45.423
‐ Thank you.
‐ Thank you.

05:48.530 --> 05:53.306
Next up, Dino.
Please step forward.

05:53.306 --> 05:55.978
Dino:
<i>Fruity, colorful,</i>
<i>meaty, Italian.</i>

05:55.978 --> 05:58.550
<i>This is definitely me,</i>
<i>a million percent, on a plate.</i>

05:58.550 --> 06:01.723
The one thing I'm worried about
is the cook of the lamb.

06:01.723 --> 06:04.662
<i>There's a lot on the line.</i>

06:04.662 --> 06:05.898
<i>It's got to be juicy,</i>

06:05.898 --> 06:06.900
<i>it's got to be pink,</i>

06:06.900 --> 06:08.469
<i>a perfect mid‐rare.</i>

06:08.469 --> 06:11.576
If that lamb is not
cooked to perfection,

06:11.576 --> 06:13.580
that could
be curtains for me.

06:13.580 --> 06:15.483
Aarón:
Dino, please describe
your entree.

06:15.483 --> 06:18.489
Dino:
<i>We have a rack of lamb</i>

06:21.028 --> 06:24.502
<i>with a fig and cipollini</i>
<i>balsamic glaze.</i>

06:24.502 --> 06:27.975
All right, Dino,
so let's get real here.

06:27.975 --> 06:30.981
I'm gonna cut right through
the middle of this.

06:30.981 --> 06:36.526
And if it's not an even pink,

06:36.526 --> 06:37.728
you take one
giant step backwards.

07:01.976 --> 07:03.379
All right, Dino,
let's get real here.

07:03.379 --> 07:05.718
I'm gonna cut right through
the middle of this.

07:05.718 --> 07:09.391
And if it's not an even pink,

07:09.391 --> 07:10.994
you take one
giant step backwards.

07:24.722 --> 07:28.597
Dino, the lamb on my plate...

07:28.597 --> 07:30.567
is a perfect medium rare.

07:32.203 --> 07:35.376
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ Textbook.

07:35.376 --> 07:40.788
Dino, getting the first one
right could be a fluke.

07:40.788 --> 07:43.593
Nailing four could be genius.

07:52.945 --> 07:56.452
It's an even more perfect
medium rare than his.

07:56.452 --> 07:58.389
( exhales )
Thank you, Chef.

07:58.389 --> 08:00.761
Let's see what I've got.

08:03.533 --> 08:06.338
‐ A perfect medium rare.
‐ Thank you.

08:15.022 --> 08:18.195
Absolutely spot‐on.

08:18.195 --> 08:19.699
Dino:
Thank you, Chef.

08:19.699 --> 08:20.701
Wow.

08:28.783 --> 08:29.986
‐ Dino?
‐ Yes, Chef.

08:29.986 --> 08:31.054
I dig it.

08:31.054 --> 08:32.825
Excellent cook
on the lamb.

08:32.825 --> 08:35.898
You caramelized
the outside well‐‐
not perfect.

08:35.898 --> 08:39.672
I, unfortunately,
have a huge big cap of fat
right here,

08:39.672 --> 08:41.643
which is a little
disappointing,

08:41.643 --> 08:44.682
but the flavor and the balance
that you were able to achieve

08:44.682 --> 08:48.657
by cooking it
evenly in two pans
and also in the oven

08:48.657 --> 08:51.461
really rendered something
that's very deep in flavor.

08:51.461 --> 08:52.998
Thank you, Chef.

08:52.998 --> 08:55.837
So, um, from the dishes
I've tasted from you so far,

08:55.837 --> 08:59.712
you have an amazing ability
to bridge old world
Italian flavors

08:59.712 --> 09:02.818
with new‐style restaurant
presentation and technique.

09:02.818 --> 09:07.595
The braised lamb caponata
is as brilliant as the cook
on the lamb.

09:07.595 --> 09:09.064
Are there errors
in this plate? Yeah.

09:09.064 --> 09:10.801
As I knew, it was
gonna be too sweet.

09:10.801 --> 09:13.472
It needs more acidity.
You should've crusted the lamb.

09:13.472 --> 09:15.276
All things
that a chef like you
that works for me,

09:15.276 --> 09:16.779
we'd fix in two minutes,

09:16.779 --> 09:18.783
because you have the most
fundamental thing of all,

09:18.783 --> 09:21.823
which is an inherent
talent to cook.

09:21.823 --> 09:23.827
Thank you, Mr. Joe.

09:23.827 --> 09:26.799
I'm impressed
by the cook on this.

09:26.799 --> 09:28.536
I like the play
of sunchokes.

09:28.536 --> 09:31.208
You have this really
intensely flavored

09:31.208 --> 09:33.880
caponata below
that is really delicious,

09:33.880 --> 09:37.453
but a little bit more salt
would help the lamb rack on top

09:37.453 --> 09:39.224
be the star and cut
through a bit more.

09:39.224 --> 09:42.698
Short of some seasoning,
there's just the right amount
of edge to it,

09:42.698 --> 09:44.467
there's just the right
amount of Dino in it.

09:44.467 --> 09:46.371
‐ Nice job.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

09:46.371 --> 09:48.910
Dino, I've got
good news and bad news.

09:48.910 --> 09:50.547
The good news is
you've nailed the lamb.
Let's get that right.

09:50.547 --> 09:53.152
The bad news is you've
used the wrong garnish

09:53.152 --> 09:54.922
for the Rolls‐Royce
of lamb.

09:54.922 --> 09:58.328
It needs to be soft,
creamy textures, acidity‐‐

09:58.328 --> 10:00.166
a sunchoke puree,
beautifully done.

10:00.166 --> 10:02.905
I go into the figs,
it's like fig jam.

10:02.905 --> 10:04.775
It's sticky,
it's overjuiced.

10:04.775 --> 10:07.614
Look, my glass is gone 'cause
I'm washing my palate down,

10:07.614 --> 10:10.419
and, you know, you cooked
the lamb beautifully,

10:10.419 --> 10:13.025
but the garnish and what
you've dressed it up with,

10:13.025 --> 10:14.929
it's the wrong coat,
young man.

10:14.929 --> 10:16.198
Thank you, Chef.

10:22.443 --> 10:26.451
Eboni, please step forward.

10:26.451 --> 10:27.955
Eboni:
<i>I'm very proud of my entree.</i>

10:27.955 --> 10:30.459
<i>It's a rustic style</i>
<i>down home dish.</i>

10:30.459 --> 10:31.829
<i>I put my heart on a plate,</i>

10:31.829 --> 10:33.666
<i>and I know that</i>
<i>all my flavors are there</i>

10:33.666 --> 10:35.604
and they taste good
cohesively.

10:35.604 --> 10:37.808
<i>This is my bounce back</i>
<i>from the appetizer.</i>

10:37.808 --> 10:40.012
<i>For every setback,</i>
<i>there's a greater comeback,</i>

10:40.012 --> 10:41.281
and your girl
brought it today.

10:41.281 --> 10:43.252
Can you please
describe the dish?

10:43.252 --> 10:46.859
Eboni:
<i>I made a spiced</i>
<i>honey glazed duck breast</i>

10:46.859 --> 10:50.801
<i>with sweet potato mash,</i>
<i>sautéed collard greens,</i>

10:50.801 --> 10:54.608
<i>crispy heirloom carrots</i>
<i>with some crispy duck skin.</i>

10:54.608 --> 10:57.113
It smells lemony
and zesty and spicy

10:57.113 --> 10:58.983
and everything
a duck should.

10:58.983 --> 11:00.921
But let's make
one thing clear, Eboni.

11:00.921 --> 11:04.829
Every chef tonight
would run a mile

11:04.829 --> 11:07.166
from having
to cook duck in a finale,

11:07.166 --> 11:10.172
'cause it's the most difficult
protein to pull off.

11:10.172 --> 11:15.149
I'm curious how long
you seared your duck breast for.

11:15.149 --> 11:17.955
I did it about
90% skin side down.

11:17.955 --> 11:19.592
I saw it start to crisp,

11:19.592 --> 11:21.161
and then I flipped it
and put it in the oven,

11:21.161 --> 11:24.033
so I would say about
between six and eight minutes.

11:30.847 --> 11:32.383
What do you think, Eboni?

11:32.383 --> 11:33.887
I think it's rare.

11:33.887 --> 11:35.824
You're right.

11:41.468 --> 11:44.140
My duck here?
Beautiful.

11:44.140 --> 11:47.079
Pink, glistening,
perfect medium rare.

11:47.079 --> 11:50.252
But, for me,
it's the fragrance
from this that I love.

11:50.252 --> 11:53.526
It's got the spice,
it's got the sweetness
from the honey.

11:53.526 --> 11:55.062
Puree, amazing.

11:55.062 --> 11:56.097
And that little sliver

11:56.097 --> 11:58.736
of crispy duck
scratchings on top,

11:58.736 --> 12:00.439
I mean, this thing here?

12:00.439 --> 12:03.378
‐ Amazing.
‐ Eboni...

12:05.817 --> 12:07.854
...my duck is undercooked.

12:07.854 --> 12:11.963
But, I have to say,
the bitterness, the acidity,

12:11.963 --> 12:13.198
the brightness of that
carrot top vinaigrette,

12:13.198 --> 12:15.402
it's exactly the flavor
that you want.

12:15.402 --> 12:18.743
That sweet potato mash,
I'm digging it big time.

12:18.743 --> 12:20.747
It's rich, it has a little bit
of cinnamon to it.

12:20.747 --> 12:22.851
Aside from the cook
on the duck breast,

12:22.851 --> 12:26.559
everything else on this plate
is incredibly delicious.

12:26.559 --> 12:28.663
Thank you, Chef.

12:28.663 --> 12:30.934
I totally,
totally agree.

12:30.934 --> 12:35.275
And you know what?
Your greens are perfection.

12:35.275 --> 12:37.113
The carrot top
is brilliant.

12:37.113 --> 12:41.889
And you are literally 90 seconds
away from a three‐star dish.

12:41.889 --> 12:43.960
And I'm gonna
finish it right here.

12:43.960 --> 12:47.400
‐ These cracklins?
‐ Amazing.

12:47.400 --> 12:50.607
Eboni, let me tell you,
I live in the South,

12:50.607 --> 12:53.045
and I eat collard greens
all the time.

12:53.045 --> 12:56.051
And these are the best
that I've ever had.

12:56.051 --> 12:59.625
There's just something
about this dish
that is so exotic.

12:59.625 --> 13:02.163
That spice,
once it starts to mingle

13:02.163 --> 13:05.670
with that honey glaze,
it is just unbelievable.

13:05.670 --> 13:09.778
All right, Eboni,
that little bit of sear?

13:09.778 --> 13:12.083
Perfect duck.

13:12.083 --> 13:14.955
You were one lighter away
from a perfect dish.

13:14.955 --> 13:16.257
Just a lighter.

13:17.794 --> 13:19.063
Thank you, Chefs.

13:25.543 --> 13:29.618
All right, Jason,
Eboni, Dino, please head
back into the kitchen

13:29.618 --> 13:32.389
and get ready to cook
for the very last time.

13:32.389 --> 13:34.962
‐ Thank you, Chef.
‐ Chef.

13:36.999 --> 13:41.809
( applause )

13:41.809 --> 13:44.781
Wow, what a night.
Guys, we're two courses in.

13:44.781 --> 13:46.585
They've all
had highs and lows,

13:46.585 --> 13:48.756
but nobody has perfected
every course yet.

13:48.756 --> 13:50.325
90 seconds is all I needed.

13:50.325 --> 13:52.831
But everything
on your dish was delicious.

13:52.831 --> 13:54.033
I mean, that's how you cook.

13:54.033 --> 13:55.503
Everybody's dessert
got to be perfect.

13:55.503 --> 13:57.841
‐ Everybody had a flaw,
so it is what it is.
‐ I know.

13:57.841 --> 13:59.678
It's down to the desserts.

13:59.678 --> 14:02.383
All right.

14:02.383 --> 14:05.823
( cheering, applause )

14:09.130 --> 14:14.975
Jason, Eboni, and Dino,
this is one very close race.

14:14.975 --> 14:18.181
And this final course is
the most important 60 minutes

14:18.181 --> 14:22.757
of your entire culinary lives.

14:22.757 --> 14:26.030
And it starts...

14:26.030 --> 14:27.032
now!

14:30.138 --> 14:33.144
‐ Let's go, guys!
‐ Make it happen!

14:33.144 --> 14:34.982
Let's go!

14:36.785 --> 14:38.054
Yachecia: Do it!

14:40.225 --> 14:42.229
It all comes down
to this final wow factor.

14:42.229 --> 14:44.801
Can they use this dessert

14:44.801 --> 14:46.639
to get their hands
on that incredible trophy?

14:48.208 --> 14:50.312
Come on, Jason.
Finish strong.

14:50.312 --> 14:52.383
Today's dessert is a creation
of my own making.

14:52.383 --> 14:55.255
<i>It's a black sesame</i>
<i>Japonaise</i>

14:55.255 --> 14:58.829
<i>with yuzu chocolate mousse</i>
<i>in a shiso berry coulis.</i>

15:00.198 --> 15:03.338
If I can execute
all the different
technical components,

15:03.338 --> 15:05.610
<i>I can produce a dessert</i>
<i>that could be a showstopper,</i>

15:05.610 --> 15:07.614
<i>that could nab me the title.</i>

15:07.614 --> 15:10.352
( crowd cheering )

15:10.352 --> 15:12.289
Let's go!
This is it!

15:12.289 --> 15:14.493
I am making
a chocolate orbit cake

15:14.493 --> 15:16.999
<i>with a chocolate rum glaze,</i>

15:16.999 --> 15:19.236
<i>macadamia nut crumble,</i>

15:19.236 --> 15:22.376
<i>and a passion fruit</i>
<i>key lime coulis.</i>

15:22.376 --> 15:23.679
<i>I came into this competition</i>

15:23.679 --> 15:25.248
<i>winning my white apron</i>
<i>with a dessert,</i>

15:25.248 --> 15:28.421
and I'm going to win
the MasterChef trophy
with a dessert.

15:28.421 --> 15:32.096
‐ Whoo! Come on!
‐ All right!
You got this, son.

15:32.096 --> 15:35.102
‐ You got this, Dino!
‐ I'm going.

15:35.102 --> 15:37.941
I'm making a roasted
pistachio tiramisu cake

15:37.941 --> 15:39.845
<i>with orange mascarpone cream,</i>

15:39.845 --> 15:43.118
<i>a pistachio tuile,</i>
<i>and espresso caviar.</i>

15:43.118 --> 15:46.190
It's gonna be something
they've never seen
a tiramisu look like.

15:46.190 --> 15:48.461
<i>This is the finale, babies,</i>

15:48.461 --> 15:49.765
so you gotta make sure
it's damn good.

16:01.487 --> 16:03.057
Gordon:
Last course, guys,

16:03.057 --> 16:04.661
across this entire competition.

16:04.661 --> 16:06.330
‐ Let's go!
‐ Whoo!

16:06.330 --> 16:07.901
‐ Oh, yeah!
‐ Keep it up!

16:07.901 --> 16:10.706
Can they use this dessert

16:10.706 --> 16:13.846
to get their hands
on that incredible trophy?

16:13.846 --> 16:15.282
Whoo!
Come on, Dino!

16:15.282 --> 16:17.954
‐ Right, Dino.
‐ Yes, Chef?

16:17.954 --> 16:19.724
Final hurdle.
How you feeling?

16:19.724 --> 16:21.060
‐ Oh, wonderful.
‐ Yeah?

16:21.060 --> 16:23.264
This one is actually
for my mother.

16:23.264 --> 16:24.935
My mother's favorite
dessert is tiramisu.

16:24.935 --> 16:27.306
Any time we went to
a restaurant, that was
the dessert she ordered.

16:27.306 --> 16:29.744
But what's the Dino spin?
Because the reality is

16:29.744 --> 16:32.282
we've all had tiramisu
a million times over.

16:32.282 --> 16:33.552
Flavor's the way
I'm gonna elevate this one.

16:33.552 --> 16:37.125
I will be doing a roasted
pistachio tiramisu

16:37.125 --> 16:39.263
with an orange
mascarpone cream

16:39.263 --> 16:40.800
and espresso caviar.

16:40.800 --> 16:42.504
Both:
Espresso caviar?

16:42.504 --> 16:44.340
It's a little trick
that you do with gelatin.

16:44.340 --> 16:46.143
You drop it
into cold vegetable oil
and it boils up.

16:46.143 --> 16:47.412
Now you're
worrying me, Dino.

16:47.412 --> 16:49.618
And, Mum, are you aware
of espresso caviar?

16:49.618 --> 16:51.922
‐ Yes, it's delicious.
‐ Dad, has he gone nuts
or what?

16:51.922 --> 16:54.528
‐ He's always gone nuts.
‐ He's always gone nuts.
Yeah, thank you.

16:54.528 --> 16:57.199
‐ What?
‐ Right, so, Dino,
just over 40 minutes

16:57.199 --> 16:59.169
‐ to nail it. Good luck.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

16:59.169 --> 17:01.240
‐ Go, Dino!
‐ ( crowd cheering )

17:07.921 --> 17:09.490
Beautiful, Jason.

17:09.490 --> 17:12.095
All right, Eboni, this is it.
So tell me about the dessert.

17:12.095 --> 17:14.734
I'm going to do
a chocolate orbit cake

17:14.734 --> 17:18.341
with a chocolate rum glaze,
macadamia crumble,

17:18.341 --> 17:20.278
‐ and a passion fruit tuile.
‐ Wow.

17:20.278 --> 17:22.584
Okay, now, it took you a little
time to get that together.

17:22.584 --> 17:24.420
‐ Was that on purpose?
‐ I wanted to make sure

17:24.420 --> 17:26.324
the batter wasn't
overworked or underworked,

17:26.324 --> 17:28.194
because if the batter's not
right when you pull 'em out,

17:28.194 --> 17:29.296
they will‐‐ poof‐‐
like soufflé.

17:29.296 --> 17:30.298
You got 'em
in the oven already?

17:30.298 --> 17:31.334
Yeah, they're in the oven.

17:31.334 --> 17:33.304
You're certainly
up against it now,

17:33.304 --> 17:35.141
because if there's
any time to pull through,
it'll be with this dessert.

17:35.141 --> 17:36.979
‐ Stick with it. You got it.
‐ Yes, Chef.

17:36.979 --> 17:39.350
Gordon:
Halfway on the last
course, guys.

17:39.350 --> 17:40.953
( cheering )

17:40.953 --> 17:44.193
Come on, Ebi, stay focused.

17:44.193 --> 17:45.963
Gordon:
Right, Jason,
what's the dish?

17:45.963 --> 17:49.236
I will be presenting you
a black sesame Japonaise

17:49.236 --> 17:51.007
with a chocolate yuzu mousse.

17:51.007 --> 17:53.378
‐ And what's that there?
‐ This is the berry coulis.

17:53.378 --> 17:55.248
I'm just chilling it
and I'm going to blitz it

17:55.248 --> 17:57.219
with the shiso leaves
to keep that freshness.

17:57.219 --> 18:00.760
We're so close
to announcing America's
next MasterChef.

18:00.760 --> 18:01.928
‐ Yes.
‐ What's going on
in your mind?

18:01.928 --> 18:03.164
Where's Jason?

18:03.164 --> 18:04.768
Before I started
the competition,

18:04.768 --> 18:07.339
I'd kind of lost my passion
for cooking a little bit.

18:07.339 --> 18:10.178
Really?
It doesn't taste like that.

18:10.178 --> 18:13.852
You know, stuff happens.
Life takes you in
different directions,

18:13.852 --> 18:16.357
and just for me to be here
in the MasterChef kitchen,

18:16.357 --> 18:18.662
( voice breaking )
I really appreciate being
here and finding that...

18:18.662 --> 18:24.073
‐ ( cheers and applause )
‐ Love you, Jason!

18:24.073 --> 18:26.578
I really appreciate
being here and finding
that spark again,

18:26.578 --> 18:29.316
and to have you guys
motivating me,

18:29.316 --> 18:31.220
um, I'm just so thrilled
and so grateful.

18:31.220 --> 18:33.391
We're glad you got
the spark back.

18:33.391 --> 18:35.763
This is anybody's game
right now, young man.

18:35.763 --> 18:38.101
‐ You have got just
22 minutes to nail it.
‐ Yes, sir.

18:38.101 --> 18:40.573
‐ Good luck.
‐ ( crowd cheering )

18:43.846 --> 18:46.518
Gordon:
Now, Joe, wait till you hear
about Dino's tiramisu.

18:46.518 --> 18:48.254
Not only is he making
his lady's fingers,

18:48.254 --> 18:50.425
but he's coming up
with a finish of
an espresso caviar.

18:50.425 --> 18:52.295
‐ I like that.
‐ Christina: A little bit
more molecular

18:52.295 --> 18:54.466
than I thought Dino
would dare to go tonight.

18:54.466 --> 18:55.736
Get it, Dino.

18:55.736 --> 18:58.074
I hope he doesn't go
too far out with this thing.

19:00.245 --> 19:01.681
Christina:
How's Eboni looking?

19:01.681 --> 19:03.685
Aarón:
Eboni's making orbit cake
with passion fruit.

19:03.685 --> 19:05.556
She has a little bit
of tuile going on there.

19:05.556 --> 19:09.263
But, guys, Eboni's cakes
aren't coming out as quick
as you'd think.

19:09.263 --> 19:10.833
Joe:
She has no margin for error.

19:10.833 --> 19:13.572
She might be plating those
with 30 seconds left.

19:17.279 --> 19:18.515
‐ Woo!
‐ Get it, Jason.

19:18.515 --> 19:20.451
Christina:
Now, with Jason,

19:20.451 --> 19:23.625
he's essentially making
a very, very high‐end
sandwich cookie.

19:23.625 --> 19:25.295
But the big jeopardy
for Jason tonight

19:25.295 --> 19:28.067
is sandwiching
those macaroons together

19:28.067 --> 19:29.102
with that mousse
in the center

19:29.102 --> 19:30.138
that's gonna ooze
out the sides.

19:30.138 --> 19:32.442
‐ Whoo!
‐ Keep it going, guys!

19:32.442 --> 19:34.446
Gordon:
We're coming down to the last,

19:34.446 --> 19:36.283
and the most important
five minutes

19:36.283 --> 19:37.385
of your culinary lives.

19:37.385 --> 19:38.722
Let's go!

19:38.722 --> 19:40.391
Whoo!

19:42.395 --> 19:44.132
Yeah, baby doll, all right!

19:45.502 --> 19:48.140
Oh, here goes Eboni's
chocolate cakes.

19:48.140 --> 19:52.315
For my entree, I pulled my duck
about 90 seconds too early

19:52.315 --> 19:53.919
<i>and it was undercooked.</i>

19:53.919 --> 19:57.660
So I let my cakes cook an extra
six and a half minutes

19:57.660 --> 20:00.298
so now we're down
to the wire.

20:00.298 --> 20:01.500
Gordon:
Here goes Eboni.

20:01.500 --> 20:03.772
I wouldn't touch those
when they're so hot.

20:03.772 --> 20:05.475
They don't
look cooked, guys.

20:05.475 --> 20:07.479
Eboni:
<i>There's no more time</i>
<i>to let it cook,</i>

20:07.479 --> 20:09.149
<i>there's no more</i>
<i>batter to rebake.</i>

20:09.149 --> 20:12.022
This cake has to be perfect.

20:12.022 --> 20:14.159
Well, if Eboni touches
those cakes too much,

20:14.159 --> 20:15.696
they could just
collapse on her.

20:15.696 --> 20:17.499
We'll see
if this one comes out.

20:17.499 --> 20:18.969
I don't think it is
gonna come out.

20:18.969 --> 20:20.973
<i>This is my moment of truth.</i>

20:20.973 --> 20:22.342
Christina:
Come on, Eboni.

20:31.393 --> 20:34.399
Oh, here goes Eboni's
chocolate cakes.

20:34.399 --> 20:36.571
Let's see if this one
comes out.

20:36.571 --> 20:39.443
I don't think it is
gonna come out.

20:39.443 --> 20:40.445
There it goes.

20:42.516 --> 20:45.421
‐ Yeah, Eboni!
‐ Whoa!

20:45.421 --> 20:47.392
Those look good.

20:47.392 --> 20:49.630
Eboni:
<i>Now I have to get</i>
<i>the cakes on a plate,</i>

20:49.630 --> 20:51.433
but I can't rush it
because then I'll mess 'em up.

20:51.433 --> 20:54.473
Gordon:
Two minutes remaining, guys.

20:54.473 --> 20:55.976
<i>So I have to take my time.</i>

20:55.976 --> 20:58.447
You need to start plating.

20:58.447 --> 21:00.284
Yachecia:
Beautiful, Jason.

21:00.284 --> 21:01.921
Oh, that's Dino's
orange marsala.

21:01.921 --> 21:04.026
Joe:
That's awfully heavy,
isn't it?

21:04.026 --> 21:06.564
Oh, it looks good to me.

21:06.564 --> 21:07.499
Gordon:
Ladies and gentlemen,

21:07.499 --> 21:10.739
90 seconds to go, guys.
Come on!

21:10.739 --> 21:12.610
Go, Dino! Caviar.

21:12.610 --> 21:14.179
Christina:
Eboni is not going to
have enough time

21:14.179 --> 21:16.216
‐ to get her tuile
on those plates.
‐ Come on, Eboni.

21:16.216 --> 21:18.287
‐ Let's go!
‐ She barely has enough time
to get the cake on.

21:18.287 --> 21:20.592
‐ Come on, Mom.
‐ Gordon: Come on, Eboni.

21:20.592 --> 21:22.062
‐ ( gasps )
‐ Oh!

21:22.062 --> 21:23.230
‐ Get it on the plate, Eboni.
‐ ( bleep )

21:23.230 --> 21:26.604
‐ 30 seconds to go!
‐ Get your tuile!

21:26.604 --> 21:29.209
‐ Cate: Move, Eboni, come on.
‐ Joe: Is Eboni going to get
everything on that plate?

21:29.209 --> 21:32.215
‐ I don't know.
‐ Come on, Mom, you got this.

21:32.215 --> 21:34.486
‐ Go!
‐ Gordon: Let's go!

21:34.486 --> 21:37.092
All: Nine, eight,

21:37.092 --> 21:40.666
seven, six, five, four,

21:40.666 --> 21:41.734
‐ three, two...
‐ Oh, my God.

21:41.734 --> 21:43.270
‐ She's not gonna do it!
‐ All: ...one!

21:43.270 --> 21:45.809
‐ Gordon: Stop!
‐ ( cheering )

21:45.809 --> 21:47.680
Oh, thank you, Jesus!

21:47.680 --> 21:50.485
Ow! Baby doll! Ow!

21:52.455 --> 21:55.094
‐ Whoo!
‐ Good job! Way to go!

21:55.094 --> 21:58.100
‐ Did she get them all?
‐ Yeah, she did.

22:03.612 --> 22:06.618
Gordon: Right.

22:06.618 --> 22:10.224
Let's get
this final tasting done,

22:10.224 --> 22:12.596
and let's find out
who is going to seal the deal

22:12.596 --> 22:14.099
and become America's
next MasterChef.

22:14.099 --> 22:17.005
All three of you, please,
bring those incredible desserts

22:17.005 --> 22:19.009
inside the MasterChef
restaurant.

22:19.009 --> 22:22.816
‐ Let's go.
‐ ( cheering )

22:28.160 --> 22:30.298
‐ Yeah!
‐ Whoo!

22:30.298 --> 22:31.968
Yachecia:
Beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful.

22:31.968 --> 22:33.972
Jeff:
Great job, guys.

22:42.556 --> 22:45.294
And now,
on to desserts.

22:45.294 --> 22:47.733
Please step forward, Dino.

22:50.338 --> 22:53.712
This dessert is an homage
to my mother.

22:53.712 --> 22:55.515
‐ You all right?
‐ Yeah, I'm okay.

22:55.515 --> 22:58.087
<i>So many emotions are going</i>
<i>through my mind right now.</i>

22:58.087 --> 22:59.322
This is probably the worst

22:59.322 --> 23:01.226
I've ever freaked out
on the inside.

23:01.226 --> 23:03.665
<i>You know, my mother's lived</i>
<i>her whole life for me.</i>

23:03.665 --> 23:05.368
I think it's my time
to finally take care of her.

23:05.368 --> 23:06.871
Please describe the dessert.

23:06.871 --> 23:11.046
<i>My dessert is a roasted</i>
<i>pistachio tiramisu cake</i>

23:11.046 --> 23:13.852
<i>with an orange</i>
<i>mascarpone cream,</i>

23:13.852 --> 23:19.396
<i>a orange glaze espresso caviar,</i>
<i>and a pistachio tuile.</i>

23:19.396 --> 23:24.540
So pistachio and orange
are kind of the two
left field flavors.

23:24.540 --> 23:26.678
Um, that way you sort of have
a different flavor

23:26.678 --> 23:28.682
that you're not really
used to with a tiramisu.

23:28.682 --> 23:30.552
I know tiramisu,
there's never really texture.

23:30.552 --> 23:32.221
There's never really
something else.

23:32.221 --> 23:35.996
I wanted to give you something
that was different.

23:42.576 --> 23:45.916
I'm not sure quite
what to say about this.

23:45.916 --> 23:48.588
It is the most
non‐traditional tiramisu

23:48.588 --> 23:52.195
in texture, consistency,
taste, conception.

23:52.195 --> 23:54.065
What you baked
are not lady fingers.

23:54.065 --> 23:56.804
They're more like
gorilla paws.

23:56.804 --> 23:59.944
So if you put
gorilla paws in a tiramisu,
what do you call it?

23:59.944 --> 24:03.016
( chuckles )
Gorilla paws?

24:03.016 --> 24:06.223
It almost kind of reminds me
of a carrot cake.

24:06.223 --> 24:07.760
I was gonna say
exactly the same.

24:07.760 --> 24:10.164
The biscuit's so thick,
it's like a cake in the middle.

24:10.164 --> 24:13.437
It's a carrot cake.
Like, a really good one.

24:13.437 --> 24:16.176
Dino, you know what
it tastes like to me?

24:16.176 --> 24:17.946
It tastes like
a tres leches cake.

24:17.946 --> 24:21.052
Like a sponge cake that's been
soaked with three milks.

24:21.052 --> 24:23.758
I just love the creaminess
of the mascarpone.

24:23.758 --> 24:27.198
The floral nature of the
pistachio working with orange

24:27.198 --> 24:29.402
is what's making this
so interesting.

24:29.402 --> 24:34.613
This is really off‐kilter,
very much like yourself,
but it's just delicious.

24:34.613 --> 24:39.623
‐ Thank you, Chef.
‐ Dino, it's bloody delicious,
but it's not a tiramisu.

24:39.623 --> 24:41.828
There's insufficient
espresso in there,

24:41.828 --> 24:43.965
and the sponge
is way too nutty.

24:43.965 --> 24:48.173
And this thing here?
It doesn't need a shard
of glass on top.

24:48.173 --> 24:51.313
You're getting
too clever there,
but it's quirky.

24:51.313 --> 24:54.753
It's weirdly delicious.
Tiramisu it's not.

24:54.753 --> 24:56.122
Did it pick me up?
Yes, it did.

24:56.122 --> 24:58.126
Thank you, Chef.

25:00.832 --> 25:04.372
The pistachio pairs well
with the orange,

25:04.372 --> 25:06.142
but I think your application
of pistachio

25:06.142 --> 25:09.984
is really weighing down
the dessert itself.

25:09.984 --> 25:13.390
I disagree with Gordon.
I like the sugar tuile on top

25:13.390 --> 25:15.461
because it adds
a little bit of sweetness

25:15.461 --> 25:17.265
where it's otherwise
quite savory.

25:17.265 --> 25:19.770
I love the idea
of the espresso caviar.

25:19.770 --> 25:21.807
I just don't love
the execution of it.

25:21.807 --> 25:23.845
‐ Thank you.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

25:23.845 --> 25:25.615
Wow. "It tastes
like carrot cake."

25:25.615 --> 25:26.851
I can't believe you said that.

25:29.455 --> 25:31.326
It's all right, baby.
Pick your head up.

25:33.798 --> 25:36.837
Next up, please, Eboni.

25:36.837 --> 25:40.779
Eboni:
<i>My dessert has to be spot‐on.</i>

25:40.779 --> 25:41.948
I mean, it usually takes

25:41.948 --> 25:43.483
three hours to make
an orbit cake.

25:43.483 --> 25:46.891
<i>I did it in 60 minutes.</i>

25:46.891 --> 25:48.661
<i>If this orbit cake is perfect,</i>

25:48.661 --> 25:51.366
I think I'm skating...
right to my trophy.

25:51.366 --> 25:54.138
Eboni, please describe
your dessert.

25:54.138 --> 25:58.180
<i>I made a chocolate orbit cake</i>
<i>with a chocolate rum glaze</i>

25:58.180 --> 26:02.088
<i>dusted with gold homemade</i>
<i>macadamian crumble</i>

26:02.088 --> 26:05.027
<i>with a passion fruit</i>
<i>macadamian tuile</i>

26:05.027 --> 26:06.864
<i>and a little</i>
<i>passion fruit coulis.</i>

26:06.864 --> 26:09.837
So it's a flourless
chocolate cake,
but not a molten lava cake.

26:09.837 --> 26:12.141
It's more of a mousse‐y
type texture,

26:12.141 --> 26:14.680
fudge‐y like,
when you get in the inside.

26:14.680 --> 26:17.552
So when I slice down
into this chocolate cake,

26:17.552 --> 26:22.863
I'm looking for an even,
glossy glaze throughout.

26:22.863 --> 26:25.034
I should see a nice
set center

26:25.034 --> 26:26.737
consistent
all the way through.

26:26.737 --> 26:29.743
That will tell me
that you have

26:29.743 --> 26:33.483
a chocolate cake that
could be worth $250,000.

26:33.483 --> 26:36.156
Let's see how you did.

26:50.885 --> 26:53.925
Eboni, when I slice down
into this chocolate cake,

26:53.925 --> 26:57.799
I should see a nice
set center

26:57.799 --> 26:59.235
consistent
all the way through.

27:00.538 --> 27:01.974
Let's see how you did.

27:08.921 --> 27:12.929
Oh, my God, Eboni.
Look at it.

27:12.929 --> 27:16.336
I mean, Eboni,
it looks like chocolate mousse
in the center.

27:16.336 --> 27:21.212
It's steamed perfectly.
There are a few small holes.

27:21.212 --> 27:24.953
But overall,
it's a pretty
consistent batter.

27:24.953 --> 27:26.791
I'm waiting for you
to taste it. Use a spoon.

27:26.791 --> 27:29.395
Yes, ma'am.

27:29.395 --> 27:31.132
Don't mind if I do.

27:40.952 --> 27:43.825
Is it nasty?

27:43.825 --> 27:46.564
It's incredible.
It's perfectly baked.

27:46.564 --> 27:51.272
That macadamia crumble,
you should just make
and jar and sell.

27:51.272 --> 27:53.276
Dark rum in the glaze
gives it a depth.

27:53.276 --> 27:57.686
Eboni, I have never
doubted you since day one,

27:57.686 --> 28:03.129
and this cake
is the perfect ending
to an incredible journey.

28:03.129 --> 28:05.768
I don't want to cry, y'all.
You're gonna make me cry.

28:05.768 --> 28:08.641
It's unstoppable. Nice job.

28:08.641 --> 28:14.151
Eboni, I know you probably
haven't fallen in love
with my charm tonight.

28:14.151 --> 28:15.989
I'm just scared of you.

28:15.989 --> 28:17.291
‐ You're scared of me?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

28:17.291 --> 28:21.165
‐ Why?
‐ I don't know.
I've met my match.

28:21.165 --> 28:24.338
I would say that really
I'm no match for you

28:24.338 --> 28:26.577
because I would never make

28:26.577 --> 28:28.246
a chocolate cake
as delicious as this.

28:28.246 --> 28:30.017
Oh, my God, thank you.

28:30.017 --> 28:33.958
The glaze is fantastic.
The contrast of the crumble
is perfection.

28:33.958 --> 28:38.166
The passion fruit is
the perfect little edge to it.

28:38.166 --> 28:39.503
A really world‐class dessert.

28:39.503 --> 28:40.838
Good job.

28:43.476 --> 28:46.049
The cake itself, delicious.

28:46.049 --> 28:48.053
The macadamia, I love that.

28:48.053 --> 28:50.324
But...

28:50.324 --> 28:52.127
there's one element
of this cake

28:52.127 --> 28:53.965
that I think is too excessive.

28:53.965 --> 28:59.342
You put cocoa powder
and cheap corn syrup
glaze on top.

28:59.342 --> 29:02.181
And that, for me,
is taking away

29:02.181 --> 29:04.820
the subtle and beautiful
nuances of that cake.

29:04.820 --> 29:07.024
Eboni, young lady,
you know, tough night,

29:07.024 --> 29:08.961
but your timing is spot on

29:08.961 --> 29:13.436
because you've just given us
a wow factor of a dessert.

29:13.436 --> 29:17.044
Three‐star Michelin
pastry chefs strive
to get that balance

29:17.044 --> 29:20.885
between the sweety, salty,
crunchy, textured‐‐

29:20.885 --> 29:22.321
and then that
airbrushing thing,

29:22.321 --> 29:25.060
you know,
only you would do.

29:25.060 --> 29:27.632
‐ Delicious.
‐ Thank you, Chefs.
Thank you, Joe.

29:30.037 --> 29:31.907
Nice job.

29:31.907 --> 29:34.045
And finally, Jason.

29:36.482 --> 29:38.988
I feel that my dessert
is the best execution

29:38.988 --> 29:40.424
of all my three dishes so far.

29:40.424 --> 29:42.327
‐ Thank you.
‐ You're welcome.

29:42.327 --> 29:44.365
<i>It has the flavor,</i>
<i>it has the texture,</i>

29:44.365 --> 29:46.102
<i>it has the presentation.</i>

29:46.102 --> 29:47.939
<i>I'm so excited for the judges</i>
<i>to finally taste something</i>

29:47.939 --> 29:50.110
that I feel 100% proud of.

29:50.110 --> 29:54.085
<i>My dessert for you this evening</i>
<i>is a black sesame Japonaise</i>

29:54.085 --> 29:55.922
<i>with a chocolate yuzu mousse</i>

29:55.922 --> 29:58.928
<i>and a blackberry/blueberry</i>
<i>shiso coulis.</i>

29:58.928 --> 30:03.403
You know, Jason, visually,
you never cease to amaze me.

30:03.403 --> 30:05.942
‐ It's a work of art.
‐ Thank you.

30:05.942 --> 30:07.579
‐ Gordon: Question.
‐ Yes, sir?

30:07.579 --> 30:09.616
How do I eat this thing?
Do I pick it up
with my hands and bite?

30:09.616 --> 30:11.319
I mean,
however you want to eat it,

30:11.319 --> 30:12.989
that's perfectly up to you.

30:15.628 --> 30:17.097
Mm.

30:18.233 --> 30:20.805
All right, guys,
watch and learn.

30:20.805 --> 30:22.809
‐ Oreo technique.
‐ Oh.

30:22.809 --> 30:23.811
Dip on the side.

30:23.811 --> 30:27.151
Some of the sauce. Boom.

30:27.151 --> 30:29.155
‐ Impressive, Joe.
‐ That works.

30:29.155 --> 30:31.660
Gordon:
Jason, you know,
I said it months ago.

30:31.660 --> 30:33.797
You're like this encyclopedia
that just keeps on adding

30:33.797 --> 30:35.868
chapter after chapter,
week after week.

30:35.868 --> 30:37.171
The chocolate mousse
is fabulous.

30:37.171 --> 30:39.876
I mean,
you've got a touch
of magic there.

30:39.876 --> 30:42.014
The yuzu just lifts it up
to something really exciting.

30:42.014 --> 30:43.884
This is zesty and vibrant.

30:43.884 --> 30:45.487
I would have made
the sandwich a bit lighter.

30:45.487 --> 30:47.659
‐ Okay.
‐ The garnish is exceptional.

30:47.659 --> 30:50.565
The crunch
of that cru de cacao,
near breathtaking.

30:50.565 --> 30:51.667
You've nailed it,
young man.

30:51.667 --> 30:55.006
Jason, it's gorgeous.
It's elegant.

30:55.006 --> 30:57.712
It's full of technique,
but I agree with Gordon.

30:57.712 --> 30:59.883
I think what actually makes
this dessert so special

30:59.883 --> 31:01.720
is actually the chocolate
yuzu mousse.

31:01.720 --> 31:04.458
It, along with the shiso,
the berries, the flowers

31:04.458 --> 31:05.995
that you have on
the plate are stunning,

31:05.995 --> 31:08.166
but I think in this dessert,

31:08.166 --> 31:10.838
the focus is all about
the chocolate and the yuzu.

31:10.838 --> 31:13.677
‐ Nice job.
‐ Thank you. Thank you.

31:13.677 --> 31:16.048
Yeah, I'm taken back
by how all those

31:16.048 --> 31:18.854
very sort of strong flavors
like shiso, yuzu,

31:18.854 --> 31:20.223
are working in such
a harmonious way.

31:20.223 --> 31:23.229
And this dessert
is not overly sweet.

31:23.229 --> 31:25.801
People don't refer to desserts
as being well‐seasoned.

31:25.801 --> 31:27.170
This is
a well‐seasoned dessert.

31:27.170 --> 31:28.874
Thank you very much.

31:28.874 --> 31:33.249
It's tart, acidic, sweet,
chewy, nutty, crunchy.

31:33.249 --> 31:36.055
We have a great nod
to Asian cuisine

31:36.055 --> 31:38.661
along with a great
sweet sensibility of just
the delicious dessert.

31:38.661 --> 31:40.698
‐ Good job.
‐ Thank you.

31:42.234 --> 31:43.436
Wow. Dino, Eboni, Jason,

31:43.436 --> 31:45.440
it's been
an incredible journey.

31:45.440 --> 31:48.246
The next time we see you,

31:48.246 --> 31:50.083
we will be crowning one of you

31:50.083 --> 31:53.189
America's next MasterChef.

31:53.189 --> 31:54.759
Whoa.

31:54.759 --> 31:58.099
Right now, we need...
some valuable time.

31:58.099 --> 32:01.105
Please, head back
into the kitchen

32:01.105 --> 32:03.677
with your heads
held up high.

32:03.677 --> 32:06.583
( cheering )

32:12.394 --> 32:14.699
‐ Yeah!
‐ Woohoo!

32:17.204 --> 32:19.074
Wow. I mean,
come on, seriously.

32:19.074 --> 32:21.212
All three of them really
brought their A game.

32:21.212 --> 32:24.519
‐ For sure.
‐ We now have to pick
one winner.

32:24.519 --> 32:27.124
So, Eboni's appetizer,
pan‐seared scallops

32:27.124 --> 32:28.393
<i>with that charred Romanesco</i>

32:28.393 --> 32:29.629
<i>and then that delicious</i>
<i>pea puree.</i>

32:29.629 --> 32:31.399
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>the dish looked stunning.</i>

32:31.399 --> 32:35.240
What I enjoyed the most
was the refined nature
of the pea puree.

32:35.240 --> 32:38.312
It was herbaceous,
perfumed lovely withthat Meyer l

32:38.312 --> 32:41.987
But she was 60 seconds away
from nailing those scallops.

32:41.987 --> 32:45.460
Now, for her entree,
she gave us a spiced
honey glazed duck breast,

32:45.460 --> 32:48.901
<i>sweet potato mash,</i>
<i>carrot top vinaigrette,</i>

32:48.901 --> 32:51.338
<i>and those fried Thumbelina</i>
<i>carrots on top.</i>

32:51.338 --> 32:52.675
‐ The collard greens
were delicious.
‐ Yeah.

32:52.675 --> 32:54.244
The carrot top vinaigrette,
beautiful.

32:54.244 --> 32:55.581
The fragrance of the duck
was amazing.

32:55.581 --> 32:58.019
<i>The problem was the cook</i>
<i>on the duck.</i>

32:58.019 --> 33:01.025
Yes, the duck breast
was undercooked, but,
man, what a dish of food.

33:01.025 --> 33:03.931
And quite frankly,
when I tasted that duck
cooked properly,

33:03.931 --> 33:05.734
it might have been
the best dish of the night.

33:05.734 --> 33:08.139
I thought Eboni's
chocolate cake is the one
that sealed the deal.

33:08.139 --> 33:10.143
‐ Dynamite.
‐ Gordon: <i>This thing was</i>
<i>airbrushed at the end</i>

33:10.143 --> 33:11.880
<i>with a bit of gold dust.</i>

33:11.880 --> 33:13.449
<i>It was rich, delicious,</i>

33:13.449 --> 33:16.455
<i>and that incredible macadamian</i>
<i>crust was spectacular.</i>

33:16.455 --> 33:18.560
You know, all credit to her,

33:18.560 --> 33:21.298
for a military wife
cooking at home for the kids,

33:21.298 --> 33:24.304
she came in with
nowhere near that finesse.

33:24.304 --> 33:27.410
The journey for this girl
has been exceptional.

33:27.410 --> 33:29.816
Eboni:
<i>I stuck to what's true to me,</i>

33:29.816 --> 33:31.318
<i>what I traditionally do</i>
<i>in my household</i>

33:31.318 --> 33:32.688
<i>with my family and my kids.</i>

33:32.688 --> 33:34.592
And I took all the things
that I learned here

33:34.592 --> 33:36.328
<i>during my MasterChef journey,</i>

33:36.328 --> 33:38.199
<i>and I just married 'em</i>
<i>together,</i>

33:38.199 --> 33:41.338
and that's what makes my menu
MasterChef trophy worthy.

33:41.338 --> 33:44.779
The appetizer of the year
was Dino's.

33:44.779 --> 33:46.148
Absolutely.

33:46.148 --> 33:48.152
<i>It's not easy</i>
<i>to make squid ink pasta,</i>

33:48.152 --> 33:49.522
<i>to cook it properly,</i>

33:49.522 --> 33:51.826
<i>to make a beautiful</i>
<i>clam squid ragout.</i>

33:51.826 --> 33:55.033
He nailed every
single element of it.

33:55.033 --> 33:57.404
It had opinion, it was bold,
it wasn't afraid.

33:57.404 --> 33:59.374
‐ It was 100% spot‐on.
‐ Yeah.

33:59.374 --> 34:01.345
Aarón:
<i>And you follow that up</i>
<i>with that rack of lamb</i>

34:01.345 --> 34:04.151
<i>that was paired with</i>
<i>sunchokes, lamb belly,</i>

34:04.151 --> 34:07.357
and that balsamic vinegar
running throughout that dish.

34:07.357 --> 34:09.829
The actual hero,
he nailed beautifully.

34:09.829 --> 34:12.367
However, the fig jam
was way too sweet.

34:12.367 --> 34:14.706
‐ No.
‐ And the caponata
wasn't a caponata.

34:14.706 --> 34:16.710
Joe:
<i>Putting the braised</i>
<i>lamb belly in</i>

34:16.710 --> 34:17.878
<i>makes it very untraditional,</i>

34:17.878 --> 34:19.649
but I think in this case,
it really worked.

34:19.649 --> 34:21.385
I thought it was delicious.

34:21.385 --> 34:24.792
I gotta say, I loved
Dino's appetizer and entree,

34:24.792 --> 34:28.399
but I really didn't love
the execution of his dessert.

34:28.399 --> 34:30.470
Gordon:
<i>It wasn't a classic tiramisu,</i>

34:30.470 --> 34:33.242
<i>but making</i>
<i>your own lady's fingers,</i>
<i>that amazing soak,</i>

34:33.242 --> 34:35.480
<i>and then the orange liqueur‐‐</i>
<i>beautifully done.</i>

34:35.480 --> 34:37.017
It was Dino
in a goldfish bowl.

34:37.017 --> 34:38.386
Can I say something
about Dino?

34:38.386 --> 34:40.591
The caponata might not
have been a caponata.

34:40.591 --> 34:42.595
The tiramisu might not
have been a tiramisu.

34:42.595 --> 34:46.402
But I saw a glimpse
of almost genius,
I think, today.

34:46.402 --> 34:48.239
‐ He cooks like my mother.
‐ Really?

34:48.239 --> 34:50.678
Joe:
<i>Yes. He cooks from the heart.</i>

34:50.678 --> 34:53.382
I think a lot of people
underestimated me at the start
of this competition,

34:53.382 --> 34:56.255
<i>but I've really matured a lot</i>
<i>since I've been here.</i>

34:56.255 --> 34:59.929
<i>I made my own unorthodox</i>
<i>twist to classic Italian.</i>

34:59.929 --> 35:01.633
<i>And I gave my mother</i>
<i>something to be proud of,</i>

35:01.633 --> 35:04.572
which gave me something
to be proud of.

35:04.572 --> 35:08.212
Right, Jason started off
with that incredible
sea urchin custard

35:08.212 --> 35:11.986
<i>topped with prawns, clams,</i>
<i>and Meyer lemon vinaigrette.</i>

35:11.986 --> 35:15.059
It was elegant,
but you can't eat
all that custard.

35:15.059 --> 35:18.499
But from a flavor standpoint,
the prawn was delicious.

35:18.499 --> 35:20.738
<i>I thought that</i>
<i>that salmon roe was nice.</i>

35:20.738 --> 35:23.242
Aarón: <i>For me, I just</i>
<i>absolutely loved the flavor</i>
<i>and the balance of uni,</i>

35:23.242 --> 35:25.914
how it really sort of
perfumed the actual custard.

35:25.914 --> 35:27.450
Gordon:
<i>And then for his entree,</i>

35:27.450 --> 35:29.589
<i>he had that tofu skin</i>
<i>wrapped black cod.</i>

35:29.589 --> 35:31.125
<i>Very complex.</i>

35:31.125 --> 35:34.632
He got carried away with doing
something different and new.

35:34.632 --> 35:36.235
I quite liked Jason's entree.

35:36.235 --> 35:37.805
<i>I thought the cod</i>
<i>was cooked beautifully.</i>

35:37.805 --> 35:39.474
<i>I loved that</i>
<i>ginger scallion sauce.</i>

35:39.474 --> 35:41.813
And it's an entree that
this kitchen has never seen,

35:41.813 --> 35:44.251
and was prepared
rather successfully.

35:44.251 --> 35:47.290
You have to reward
someone conceptually

35:47.290 --> 35:50.329
<i>for putting a pea shoot</i>
<i>extraction as a sauce.</i>

35:50.329 --> 35:51.766
We're not on
a cleansing program.

35:51.766 --> 35:54.672
He is bringing
a global trend.

35:54.672 --> 35:56.341
Oh, stop it.

35:56.341 --> 35:58.412
The guy's willing to take
the next step, take a risk.

35:58.412 --> 36:00.751
We gotta reward that here
because we're sending a message

36:00.751 --> 36:03.055
to all of America
of what food is
in the world,

36:03.055 --> 36:04.424
and this is important stuff.

36:04.424 --> 36:07.263
I think, for me,
what was the most memorable

36:07.263 --> 36:09.234
was that chocolate
yuzu mousse.

36:09.234 --> 36:11.071
<i>The combination of citrus</i>
<i>and chocolate,</i>

36:11.071 --> 36:14.311
<i>then using it with something</i>
<i>as aggressive as shiso,</i>

36:14.311 --> 36:17.651
he took all of those very
assertive, strong flavors
and made them harmonious.

36:17.651 --> 36:18.987
Gordon:
<i>The fragrance of the berries</i>

36:18.987 --> 36:20.489
<i>and the coulis underneath,</i>
<i>beautiful.</i>

36:20.489 --> 36:23.462
This guys cooks from the heart,
and it means so much to him.

36:23.462 --> 36:25.266
I think that's a very special
and unique talent

36:25.266 --> 36:27.938
when you can kind of
put that much emotion
into your food.

36:27.938 --> 36:30.944
And I really got to know him
a little bit from eating
those three dishes.

36:30.944 --> 36:33.750
My menu's full of risks.
It's not from a recipe book.

36:33.750 --> 36:35.419
It's not from something
I saw online.

36:35.419 --> 36:37.591
<i>I went out of the box trying</i>
<i>something original</i>

36:37.591 --> 36:40.329
<i>and unique and creative,</i>
<i>showing my heritage</i>

36:40.329 --> 36:42.534
as a Chinese‐American,
first generation.

36:42.534 --> 36:44.972
<i>I'm hoping that</i>
<i>my gamble pays off.</i>

36:44.972 --> 36:49.314
For me, tonight's winner
is based on the journey

36:49.314 --> 36:51.184
from coming in
battling for an apron

36:51.184 --> 36:53.823
<i>to presenting their menu,</i>
<i>their inspiration,</i>

36:53.823 --> 36:57.731
and their soul left on
that plate.

36:57.731 --> 36:59.535
Do we all agree?

36:59.535 --> 37:02.006
‐ I'm convinced.
‐ Yeah.

37:02.006 --> 37:03.108
Let's go and tell them.

37:05.514 --> 37:08.285
( cheering )

37:18.873 --> 37:22.313
( cheers, applause )

37:27.725 --> 37:30.196
Jason:
<i>Winning the MasterChef trophy</i>
<i>would dispel the myth</i>

37:30.196 --> 37:32.568
that those who can't do,
teach.

37:32.568 --> 37:35.473
<i>I've always wanted</i>
<i>to show my students</i>

37:35.473 --> 37:36.909
that if you go after
your dreams,

37:36.909 --> 37:37.978
you can accomplish them.

37:37.978 --> 37:40.049
<i>So what's at stake for me</i>

37:40.049 --> 37:41.753
is at the core of
who I am as a teacher.

37:43.355 --> 37:46.596
It's not that I want it.
It's that I need it.

37:46.596 --> 37:50.436
And I need it because
I had a baby at 16.

37:50.436 --> 37:52.407
Me and my husband
used to be homeless.

37:52.407 --> 37:55.547
<i>I'm used to having to fight</i>
<i>for everything.</i>

37:55.547 --> 37:59.588
I've come through so much
hard times.

37:59.588 --> 38:02.460
I'm, like, finally looking
for a blessing.

38:02.460 --> 38:05.734
Dino, Eboni, and Jason,
your journey has been a long,

38:05.734 --> 38:07.470
incredible, exciting road.

38:07.470 --> 38:09.140
‐ Absolutely.
‐ Yes, Chef.

38:09.140 --> 38:11.411
You've all confirmed
you have the passion,

38:11.411 --> 38:13.415
the dedication,
and the drive

38:13.415 --> 38:15.352
to make it
in the culinary world.

38:15.352 --> 38:18.158
Your amateur days
are long gone.

38:18.158 --> 38:22.233
So, do us a big favor
and swap places with us

38:22.233 --> 38:23.536
because you deserve
to be standing here.

38:23.536 --> 38:25.540
‐ Yeah!
‐ Thank you.

38:25.540 --> 38:29.080
( crowd cheering )

38:29.080 --> 38:31.384
I came to "MasterChef"
to finally live,

38:31.384 --> 38:33.690
to finally do
what I wanted to do,

38:33.690 --> 38:36.596
<i>to do better for myself,</i>
<i>to make my mother proud of me.</i>

38:36.596 --> 38:39.568
I've come so far,
and I've done so much,

38:39.568 --> 38:43.710
<i>and we're about to find out</i>
<i>if that paid off.</i>

38:43.710 --> 38:47.316
We're about to find out.

38:47.316 --> 38:51.659
One of you
is about to walk away...

38:51.659 --> 38:56.468
with a check for a quarter
of a million dollars.

38:59.642 --> 39:04.618
And one of you is about to win
the most coveted prize of all.

39:06.689 --> 39:09.460
The MasterChef trophy...

39:09.460 --> 39:11.866
and the ultimate
culinary honor,

39:11.866 --> 39:14.304
the title of MasterChef.

39:17.410 --> 39:20.416
America's next
MasterChef is...

39:22.486 --> 39:24.257
congratulations...

39:30.002 --> 39:33.108
( exhales sharply )

39:33.108 --> 39:35.680
‐ Dino!
‐ Aah!

39:35.680 --> 39:37.651
Oh, my God!

39:37.651 --> 39:40.957
Love you, Dino!
Congratulations!

39:40.957 --> 39:42.961
Oh, my God!

39:46.669 --> 39:48.673
‐ Oh, come on.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

39:48.673 --> 39:51.679
‐ Well done.
‐ Oh, my God!

39:51.679 --> 39:54.785
<i>I am the next MasterChef!</i>

39:54.785 --> 39:56.555
Mommy, I did it!

39:56.555 --> 39:58.526
Mother! I did it, Ma!

39:58.526 --> 40:03.536
Crowd:
Dino! Dino! Dino! Dino!

40:03.536 --> 40:05.306
‐ I did it, Ma.
‐ Dino!

40:05.306 --> 40:06.709
<i>This is the biggest moment</i>
<i>of my life.</i>

40:06.709 --> 40:08.546
My whole life was built
for this‐‐

40:08.546 --> 40:10.583
for this right here,
for this point.

40:10.583 --> 40:12.754
Way to go, son.
I love you.

40:12.754 --> 40:14.892
Oh, my God,
I'm so proud of you.

40:14.892 --> 40:17.029
I'm very proud of everything
I accomplished tonight.

40:17.029 --> 40:19.835
<i>And I know my mother's</i>
<i>proud of me.</i>

40:19.835 --> 40:21.171
I can't believe this.

40:21.171 --> 40:23.576
That's all that really
matters to me.

40:23.576 --> 40:25.412
‐ I'm proud of you, Mommy.
‐ Yeah.

40:25.412 --> 40:29.020
I'm happy for Dino.
I'm proud of Jason, myself.

40:29.020 --> 40:32.561
It's just not my time yet.
I'm still gonna pursue
my food dream.

40:32.561 --> 40:36.267
‐ This ain't the last of me.
‐ Dino, baby doll!

40:36.267 --> 40:39.575
I'm so proud of you.
Thank you for cheering me on
this entire time.

40:39.575 --> 40:41.712
‐ I'm so happy for you.
I love you.
‐ I love you, too.

40:41.712 --> 40:43.248
To make it this far
in the finale

40:43.248 --> 40:46.154
and to cook for the judges
and to make so many friends,

40:46.154 --> 40:50.897
I am just over the moon.
I feel like I won, too.

40:50.897 --> 40:54.605
This right here is my ticket
to the beginning of my life.

40:54.605 --> 40:56.007
<i>For the last 28 years,</i>

40:56.007 --> 40:58.412
<i>I've been trying to</i>
<i>figure out who I am.</i>

40:58.412 --> 41:00.617
And now I'm finally awake,

41:00.617 --> 41:02.186
and I'm finally getting
to go out there

41:02.186 --> 41:04.357
and be that positive light
that I was born to be.

41:04.357 --> 41:05.693
Ladies and gentlemen,

41:05.693 --> 41:08.398
America's next MasterChef,
Dino!

41:08.398 --> 41:11.070
( cheering )

41:11.070 --> 41:14.711
‐ Baby doll!
‐ Yeah!

41:28.438 --> 41:30.777
I am the next MasterChef!

41:30.777 --> 41:32.012
Ow!
