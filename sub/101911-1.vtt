00:49.299 --> 00:54.346
<i>The average person lives 27,375 days.</i>

00:55.347 --> 00:57.307
<i>That's all we get, if we're lucky.</i>

00:57.808 --> 01:01.895
<i>27,375.</i>

01:03.063 --> 01:06.149
<i>At first, I thought
it didn't really seem like a lot of time.</i>

01:06.233 --> 01:09.319
<i>But then again, how many days
do we really remember anyway?</i>

01:10.529 --> 01:16.118
<i>Most days pass by unnoticed,
unremarkable, unmarked.</i>

01:17.536 --> 01:20.914
<i>Because we only remember the days
when we feel something happened.</i>

01:21.498 --> 01:25.002
<i>Something beautiful or tragic.</i>

01:25.627 --> 01:28.213
<i>Most days will pass in a blur.</i>

01:28.297 --> 01:29.631
<i>So many of mine did.</i>

01:29.715 --> 01:33.844
<i>They were lost in routine
or school or both.</i>

01:33.927 --> 01:37.181
<i>I didn't notice my life
was becoming a series of forgotten days.</i>

01:37.723 --> 01:38.724
- Ugly.
- Yeah.

01:38.807 --> 01:40.309
<i>Everything was being saved for later.</i>

01:40.392 --> 01:41.643
You made that money, honey.

01:41.727 --> 01:44.104
<i>Live spontaneously, later.</i>

01:45.439 --> 01:47.274
- Dude!
- <i>Travel, later.</i>

01:48.150 --> 01:51.486
- Amanda!
- <i>Find love, later.</i>

01:51.570 --> 01:52.738
Sorry, sorry.

01:52.821 --> 01:55.490
<i>But everything can change in a day.</i>

01:55.574 --> 01:57.117
If you kill my friends, I kill you.

01:58.869 --> 02:00.913
<i>And what might be missing...</i>

02:01.496 --> 02:03.498
<i>becomes so very clear.</i>

02:21.099 --> 02:23.268
This place has, like, three stars on Yelp.

02:26.563 --> 02:28.148
Oh, really?

02:28.815 --> 02:31.568
Just one drink
and then we'll go to dinner.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.278
- I swear.
- I'm gonna go pee.

02:33.362 --> 02:34.446
I'll grab a table.

02:35.030 --> 02:36.907
- Get beer.
- He's doing it!

02:36.990 --> 02:38.825
Ah! Whoo!

02:38.909 --> 02:39.910
No.

02:41.453 --> 02:43.705
How did we end up at a sports bar today?

02:43.789 --> 02:49.211
I'm sorry. I get that I'm giving you PTSD
from your time at Ruck's.

02:49.294 --> 02:50.295
Stop.

02:50.379 --> 02:54.466
You were the best worst bartender
that I had ever seen.

02:54.550 --> 02:56.718
Gosh. There's always a line. Jeez.

02:56.802 --> 02:58.220
- I know.
- No matter where you go.

02:58.804 --> 03:00.514
Yum.

03:00.597 --> 03:03.976
I would like to propose a toast

03:04.059 --> 03:05.769
to the beautiful, brilliant,

03:05.853 --> 03:09.439
wildly talented, recently promoted Amanda.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.733
- Cheers.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.

03:11.817 --> 03:13.735
And to getting an assistant.

03:13.819 --> 03:16.321
There you go!

03:21.618 --> 03:23.787
- Oh, incoming.
- How you doing, ladies?

03:23.871 --> 03:26.540
Y'all look a little lonely.
Keep you some company.

03:26.623 --> 03:28.834
Uh, there's three of us.

03:28.917 --> 03:31.086
I'm Dave. This is Kyle. Sol.

03:31.170 --> 03:32.546
I'm sorry...

03:33.547 --> 03:36.466
They're the lonely ones.
I'm just embarrassed.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.844
Embarrassed for you or for them?

03:38.927 --> 03:40.220
For them right now.

03:40.304 --> 03:43.348
And me... very soon.

03:44.183 --> 03:46.393
All right. We're just gonna start over.

03:46.476 --> 03:48.687
We just wanted to come over
and say hi. So, hi.

03:48.770 --> 03:50.230
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:50.314 --> 03:52.357
I'ma tell y'all a story
that's gonna change your life.

03:52.441 --> 03:54.610
- I...
- No, no. We're gonna go.

03:54.693 --> 03:56.278
- You don't have to.
- You don't have to...

03:56.361 --> 03:58.614
You do wanna hear the story.
Listen, you wanna hear the...

03:58.697 --> 04:01.992
No, no, no. Now we have to hear the story.
What kind of story?

04:02.075 --> 04:03.744
I'm gonna tell you ladies

04:03.827 --> 04:06.288
a story about the time
I almost lost my pinkie toe.

04:06.371 --> 04:07.748
- Wait.
- Okay. I'm out.

04:07.831 --> 04:10.125
I'm gonna get you drinks
and save myself the embarrassment.

04:10.209 --> 04:11.960
- I'll come with you.
- No, you will not.

04:12.044 --> 04:14.505
You will stay right here,
'cause we telling this story together.

04:14.588 --> 04:15.589
- Yeah.
- All right.

04:15.672 --> 04:18.509
I'm on the back of the moped, right?
This guy right here, he's driving.

04:18.591 --> 04:21.386
All of a sudden,
a squirrel just pops out of nowhere.

04:21.470 --> 04:24.348
At this point, the moped is grinding,
like, up against the curb,

04:24.431 --> 04:26.391
and now my toe is pinned down, right?

04:26.475 --> 04:30.771
You know what? I am gonna go help
your friend with the drinks.

04:30.854 --> 04:32.314
But, um, great story.

04:32.397 --> 04:33.440
Hey, where you...

04:33.524 --> 04:36.443
Especially when you do a takedown.
You don't want them to come from under...

04:36.527 --> 04:41.156
So, who you guys rooting for?
Baldy No Neck or Big Arm Chicken Legs?

04:41.240 --> 04:45.410
Um, baldy with no neck. He's the underdog.

04:45.494 --> 04:47.287
- Another Dave's Margarita?
- Yeah.

04:47.371 --> 04:48.372
Make it two.

04:49.915 --> 04:52.125
So, your friend's story...

04:52.793 --> 04:54.378
Oh, yeah. I'm...

04:54.461 --> 04:58.507
I apologize for that.
He thinks it's a great icebreaker.

04:59.341 --> 05:01.927
It's actually not a bad idea,
all things considered.

05:02.010 --> 05:03.095
It's playing the odds.

05:04.638 --> 05:05.639
How so?

05:06.348 --> 05:09.768
So, 99 out of 100 girls
will hate that story.

05:09.852 --> 05:11.019
- Right? Hate it.
- Mm-hmm.

05:11.103 --> 05:13.105
But if he can find that one,

05:13.188 --> 05:17.025
that one girl who loves a good smooshed
baby toe story, she'll be floored.

05:17.109 --> 05:18.569
It's a soul-mate moment for her.

05:18.652 --> 05:22.447
If you believe in destiny and chance
and meeting the right person,

05:22.531 --> 05:23.907
then it's worth the risk.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.076
He has the right idea.

05:29.162 --> 05:30.998
...jumped off the trash can.

05:32.249 --> 05:35.586
- I still think it's the wrong idea.
- Maybe.

05:42.718 --> 05:44.636
Okay, this stare is officially

05:44.720 --> 05:47.222
two seconds away
from turning full creepazoid.

05:47.306 --> 05:49.516
- Yeah. Okay.
- You should probably blink or look left.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.643
- Do something else with your eyes.
- I'm sorry.

05:51.727 --> 05:54.730
I blame it on the margarita.
I am usually very witty and charming.

05:54.813 --> 05:56.315
That's not an excuse.

05:56.398 --> 06:00.152
James Bond is fully hammered 24/7.
He is always witty and charming.

06:00.235 --> 06:02.946
- Okay, I can give you some wit. Yeah?
- Yeah? Wit me.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.281
- Yeah. Bring it.
- Yeah?

06:04.364 --> 06:05.365
Okay. All right.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.368
When I look into your... Wow, that's...

06:08.452 --> 06:10.996
Is something supposed to be happening?
I'm confused.

06:11.079 --> 06:14.791
Okay, okay. Pause, pause.
I'm gonna try to give charming a shot.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.210
Okay, I'm...

06:23.967 --> 06:26.970
I'm gonna give you some charm, all right?
Give you some charm.

06:28.305 --> 06:29.431
- No, that's worse.
- Did you...

06:29.515 --> 06:31.266
- That was complete... Worse.
- It's bad. I can't...

06:31.350 --> 06:33.393
Stop. Stop right now. Abort.

06:33.477 --> 06:36.104
I'm gonna stop.

06:37.773 --> 06:39.441
Whoo! Whoo!

06:55.290 --> 06:56.583
Whoo!

06:59.419 --> 07:01.046
Beat my best time again.

07:01.839 --> 07:04.675
That's weird,
'cause you're, like, 15 minutes late.

07:04.758 --> 07:08.262
Nah. Saturday mornings,
there's a 20-minute grace period.

07:08.345 --> 07:09.847
Technically, I'm early.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.182
- Ready?
- Come on. Let's go.

07:12.266 --> 07:15.143
Well, I might sweat margaritas
after last night, so...

07:15.227 --> 07:16.812
- Gross.
- I'm sorry.

07:17.354 --> 07:19.773
So, what is it you do again?

07:19.857 --> 07:22.526
- I'm in digital marketing.
- What does that mean?

07:22.609 --> 07:26.321
We target consumers
based on their GPS location.

07:26.405 --> 07:28.532
You know, go for impulse buys.

07:28.615 --> 07:29.908
What about you?

07:29.992 --> 07:33.495
I'm going into debt creation.
Getting my master's in psych.

07:34.663 --> 07:36.498
You wanna be a therapist?

07:36.582 --> 07:38.625
I don't know. Maybe.

07:39.835 --> 07:43.505
People love talking to me,
and I always give spot-on advice.

07:43.589 --> 07:45.090
So, yeah.

07:47.509 --> 07:49.011
- Cramp.
- You okay? You all right?

07:49.094 --> 07:50.721
I got a cramp.

07:51.763 --> 07:52.806
Lift your arm up.

07:52.890 --> 07:54.099
- Why?
- It'll help. Trust me.

07:54.183 --> 07:56.602
Okay. Um...

07:57.978 --> 07:59.062
I lied to you.

07:59.688 --> 08:00.856
I hate running.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.233
I'm a really bad runner.

08:03.317 --> 08:05.777
God, this was a horrible idea
for a first date.

08:05.861 --> 08:07.362
Oh, so this is a date?

08:09.615 --> 08:11.575
No.

08:15.370 --> 08:19.791
All right. We have a little more left.
Hey, what are you doing?

08:19.875 --> 08:21.210
I earned one of these.

08:22.377 --> 08:24.713
- No. Not on my watch. Come on.
- What?

08:24.796 --> 08:27.007
- I got something better. Come on.
- No, come on.

08:27.090 --> 08:28.425
- Last wind.
- So far.

08:28.509 --> 08:29.593
That's right.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.762
- Wait. There are hot dogs here.
- There are hot dogs.

08:31.845 --> 08:34.431
You took me from a hot dog stand
to another hot dog stand.

08:34.515 --> 08:37.058
Isn't this a great finish line?
I love this place.

08:37.142 --> 08:38.143
Hey!

08:38.227 --> 08:39.811
- Sol! How you doing?
- Hey!

08:39.895 --> 08:42.231
- What's happening, buddy? Okay.
- I'll be right out.

08:43.732 --> 08:45.651
- Ah!
- What's up, man?

08:45.734 --> 08:47.444
- How you doing?
- I'm good.

08:47.528 --> 08:49.863
- What you got for us?
- My new zucchini fritters.

08:49.947 --> 08:52.699
Ooh! Oh, Peter, this is Jenn.

08:52.783 --> 08:53.784
- Hey.
- Hi.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.369
She wanted hot dogs for breakfast.

08:55.452 --> 08:57.287
- No, I wanted hot dogs for brunch.
- All right.

08:57.371 --> 09:00.541
Well, brunch, it's not really about food.
It's more about day drinking, isn't it?

09:00.624 --> 09:01.750
Exactly.

09:01.834 --> 09:03.585
If I wasn't jogging,

09:03.669 --> 09:06.171
I would totally be at
my cousin Gigi's place.

09:06.255 --> 09:07.422
Pepper and Salt.

09:07.506 --> 09:10.300
Oh! They got a great Moscow mule.
Love that spot.

09:10.384 --> 09:11.885
So, what do you think?

09:13.262 --> 09:15.597
Mm! It's really good.

09:15.681 --> 09:16.974
Missing a little something.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.684
Uh, yeah.

09:18.767 --> 09:23.105
Could use a smidge of sour cream
and dill. And a little bit of honey.

09:23.188 --> 09:25.232
- That'd be good. That'd be good.
- Yeah.

09:25.315 --> 09:27.025
I gotta get you back on the truck, man.

09:27.109 --> 09:29.570
- You're a chef?
- No. No, I'm not a chef.

09:29.653 --> 09:32.656
Oh, he's the best.
And I need him back on the truck.

09:32.739 --> 09:34.741
- Stop. Stop.
- I gotta get you back on here.

09:34.825 --> 09:37.119
I used to help out
on some weekends, that's all.

09:37.202 --> 09:38.370
"Help out."

09:38.453 --> 09:40.831
Hey, you wanna give it a try?

09:41.748 --> 09:42.833
Go ahead.

09:52.301 --> 09:54.720
- No. That look.
- I'm sorry.

09:54.803 --> 09:56.513
I'm not really a zucchini person.

09:56.597 --> 09:59.683
I got something you guys will like,
and I'll get you a couple waters.

09:59.766 --> 10:00.893
- Thanks, man.
- Thank you.

10:08.609 --> 10:10.068
Every vendor's local.

10:11.820 --> 10:13.906
I can't believe I've never been here.

10:14.907 --> 10:16.200
These are nice.

10:16.700 --> 10:18.702
God, these colors are amazing.

10:18.785 --> 10:20.954
- Yeah. These are beautiful.
- Thank you.

10:23.582 --> 10:24.666
Thank you.

10:38.180 --> 10:39.431
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:39.932 --> 10:41.934
- These are beautiful.
- Thank you.

10:44.853 --> 10:46.063
Rose.

10:46.939 --> 10:48.565
I love lavender.

10:50.734 --> 10:51.944
Mmm.

11:09.127 --> 11:10.212
Thank you.

12:03.515 --> 12:05.434
- Okay.
- Okay, what do you think of this?

12:05.517 --> 12:07.811
Dill zinger crunch zucchini.

12:07.895 --> 12:10.314
"Dill zinger crunch." I like that.

12:11.023 --> 12:15.569
Who would ever use this much dill?
In the world? In life, ever?

13:09.957 --> 13:13.377

Don't worry. I got you.

13:38.569 --> 13:39.695
Surprise.

13:41.697 --> 13:43.282
Thank you. Ah!

13:47.995 --> 13:49.496
What time is it?

13:53.876 --> 13:56.461
No.

13:56.962 --> 13:58.130
Ten...

13:59.131 --> 14:00.549
a.m.,

14:00.632 --> 14:02.259
p.m., I don't know.

14:09.224 --> 14:11.560
Hey, Steph, I'll be two seconds, okay?
I'm coming right back.

14:11.643 --> 14:12.644
All right.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.489
I'd eat that.

14:26.074 --> 14:27.075
Come on, Eric.

14:28.327 --> 14:29.828
You making that for Jenn?

14:29.912 --> 14:32.497
Uh, yeah.
I'm just gathering some ideas.

14:32.581 --> 14:35.667
Her mom's driving down next week,
and I wanna make a good first impression.

14:35.751 --> 14:37.085
Mom. That's big.

14:38.420 --> 14:43.008
In other news, Yasmin wants
your presentation deck by lunch.

14:43.091 --> 14:44.343
No. She said tomorrow.

14:44.426 --> 14:45.552
She did.

14:45.636 --> 14:47.054
And now it's Tuesday.

14:47.638 --> 14:50.098
And you've been working here
for almost a year,

14:50.182 --> 14:53.685
and you're still surprised
by Yasmin's little surprises.

14:54.478 --> 14:57.356
And I love that about you. I really do.

14:57.439 --> 14:59.483
- Good luck.
- Okay.

14:59.566 --> 15:02.069
<i>He was on a work trip.
What was I supposed to do?</i>

15:02.152 --> 15:03.320
<i>All right.</i>

15:03.403 --> 15:05.739
- <i>He might have been lying about that...</i>
- Jenn, open the door!

15:05.822 --> 15:07.324
This is why I gave you keys!

15:07.407 --> 15:10.911
- I forgot them. I gotta pee.
- <i>You are so cute together.</i>

15:10.994 --> 15:13.163
<i>I swear, it makes me wanna barf.</i>

15:13.789 --> 15:16.083
- <i>Okay, see you later.</i>
- Goodbye, Amanda.

15:20.379 --> 15:22.881
- I got everything you asked for. Hey.
- How are you?

15:24.591 --> 15:27.094
- How was your day?
- Sideways, backwards.

15:27.719 --> 15:30.055
- How was studying?
- Third pack of these.

15:30.556 --> 15:31.640
Got it.

15:33.392 --> 15:34.643
Gosh, okay.

15:36.812 --> 15:38.480
Why sideways?
Why backwards?

15:39.648 --> 15:40.774
It's nothing.

15:45.445 --> 15:48.490
Well, I basically tracked people
to and from their work today,

15:48.574 --> 15:51.535
and then I spent a couple more hours
doing other departments' work

15:51.618 --> 15:55.205
because Yasmin won't hire more people,
but it's fine.

15:55.289 --> 15:56.290
I'm sorry.

15:56.373 --> 15:59.042
I just can't believe
this is how I spend my day.

15:59.126 --> 16:02.963
Sol, I told you my cousin Gigi
needs more help at the restaurant.

16:03.714 --> 16:06.466
- Jenn, it's fine. It's fine.
- Quit your job.

16:06.550 --> 16:10.012
You've been talking about it for months.
Now or never, right?

16:10.095 --> 16:11.597
Or if you're not gonna quit,

16:11.680 --> 16:14.224
at least try working there
on the weekends, learn the kitchen.

16:14.308 --> 16:16.143
People go to school to become chefs.

16:16.226 --> 16:17.269
Not everybody.

16:17.352 --> 16:19.396
And everything you cook is amazing.

16:19.980 --> 16:22.024
Coming from someone
who eats Ding Dongs for dinner?

16:22.107 --> 16:24.985
Well, I'm not an elitist like you.
I'm a foodie of the people.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.905
Look, I'm just trying
to be practical, okay?

16:31.783 --> 16:33.243
I can't afford to quit.

16:34.453 --> 16:38.332
I've thought about it over and over again.
I just... I can't.

16:38.415 --> 16:41.585
I have to think about savings,
I have to think about the future and...

16:42.836 --> 16:44.588
And when I think about us, it...

16:51.261 --> 16:52.304
Move in with me.

16:55.516 --> 16:58.560
I mean, it cuts down on costs, right?

16:58.644 --> 17:01.480
You know I can barely afford
the rent on this place, and...

17:02.147 --> 17:07.236
then, maybe, eventually
you can save up enough money to quit.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.410
I will kick you out
if you suck to live with,

17:15.493 --> 17:17.119
and I'm gonna know fast.

17:20.165 --> 17:21.165
Rules.

17:22.626 --> 17:27.214
Closets will be split 80-20. In my favor.

17:27.923 --> 17:29.466
- Fine.
- Okay.

17:29.550 --> 17:33.804
Um, you cook a minimum of...

17:34.763 --> 17:36.098
five...

17:36.181 --> 17:38.016
- Three. Okay, three.
- Okay. Three.

17:38.100 --> 17:40.227
Three times a week.
That seems respectable.

17:40.727 --> 17:44.982
- Okay, only if you try everything once.
- Fair.

17:46.859 --> 17:51.321
Real talk.
Step up when it's time to step up.

17:51.822 --> 17:54.449
Mistakes I can handle,
but regrets I can't live with.

17:56.368 --> 18:01.248
Deal. But I get to bring in my couch.

18:01.748 --> 18:05.127
- But my futon.
- That futon has got to go.

18:06.044 --> 18:09.423
Fine. Eventually, we get a dog.

18:12.885 --> 18:14.511
No yappers, no shedders.

18:16.305 --> 18:18.015
No yappers, no shedders.

18:25.814 --> 18:27.399
Sex before dinner.

18:29.109 --> 18:31.486
Because after dinner, I only want TV.

18:37.784 --> 18:40.871
- Hmm...
- Is that a yes?

18:43.332 --> 18:44.833
Dave. We're gonna do it on three.

18:44.917 --> 18:46.335
- Here we go. One.
- You got it?

18:46.418 --> 18:47.669
- Yes. Two.
- Use your legs.

18:47.753 --> 18:50.005
- Here we go. Three.
- Yes.

18:50.088 --> 18:52.132
Could you slow down? I'm a bit hungover.

18:52.216 --> 18:53.967
- My foot? Good?
- Yeah, you're good.

18:54.051 --> 18:55.552
- Don't step off.
- Be careful.

18:55.636 --> 18:57.930
Wait. Why are there weights on the couch?

18:58.013 --> 18:59.139
Dude, we're already halfway.

18:59.223 --> 19:01.266
- I didn't put 'em there.
- We can't take 'em off now.

19:01.350 --> 19:02.768
Okay. All right. All good.

19:02.851 --> 19:05.145
Are you sure this thing
is gonna fit through the elevator?

19:05.229 --> 19:07.147
Yes, it is.
I measured it, like, four times.

19:08.148 --> 19:09.233
All right, let's go.

19:09.316 --> 19:11.735
We're gonna move it in.
Dave, what are you doing?

19:12.361 --> 19:13.987
Yo!

19:16.990 --> 19:18.534
I guess we're taking a break.

19:18.617 --> 19:19.952
Working hard, huh, boys?

19:20.536 --> 19:23.830
I just put these on. That's not...

19:24.581 --> 19:26.291
- Ouch.
- We been working this whole time.

19:26.375 --> 19:28.293
It sure puts the "ouch" in couch.

19:30.712 --> 19:32.422
How many more boxes
do you want to bring up?

19:32.506 --> 19:34.508
Not that many.
There's maybe, like, 20 more.

19:34.591 --> 19:36.635
I don't think we're gonna have
any more room.

19:36.718 --> 19:39.721
- We're gonna have to get a storage space.
- What?

19:39.805 --> 19:42.558
We don't need a storage space.
We can fit all this in there.

19:42.641 --> 19:44.643
Every single box is labeled "kitchen."

19:44.726 --> 19:48.188
- It looks like a lot, but it's not a lot.
- We already have a TV.

19:48.272 --> 19:50.232
- Not in the bedroom.
- Exactly.

19:51.859 --> 19:52.901
Okay.

19:53.694 --> 19:55.404
- I call it.
- I'll take it.

19:56.905 --> 19:58.657
We could get matching sweaters.

19:59.324 --> 20:01.034
Hey, can you hand me those?

20:02.661 --> 20:05.497
Pomegranate seeds
on meatballs, eh?

20:05.581 --> 20:06.748
Yes.

20:07.332 --> 20:08.375
Here.

20:13.338 --> 20:14.548
Mmm!

20:16.341 --> 20:17.926
It's so good.

20:18.010 --> 20:19.595
I'm serious. It...

20:20.554 --> 20:24.725
It tastes like magical meatballs
that grow on tiny, little meatball trees.

20:25.601 --> 20:27.019
Sol, Gigi would love those.

20:32.024 --> 20:33.400
I gotta... It's for work.

20:33.483 --> 20:34.985
- Is it important?
- I gotta answer it.

20:35.068 --> 20:36.653
- Yes, it's...
- Work is important.

20:36.737 --> 20:39.448
I don't want you...

20:39.531 --> 20:42.534
Ooh! I like when you keep it on vibrate.

20:52.586 --> 20:54.004
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:20.447 --> 21:22.032
Are you my toothbrush twin?

21:23.450 --> 21:25.994
<i>♪ My toothbrush twin ♪</i>

21:26.078 --> 21:28.539

21:38.173 --> 21:39.258
Are you okay?

21:39.341 --> 21:41.218
Yeah. Pulled a muscle working out.

21:49.852 --> 21:53.063
Sol, it's ten o'clock.
Eat something.

21:54.982 --> 21:55.983
Here.

21:58.986 --> 22:01.655
I thought you were
gonna heat up the pizza.

22:01.738 --> 22:04.324
No, not tonight.
We're eating it cold, chef.

22:06.618 --> 22:09.037
I know. I'm sorry.
I have to send this out by tonight.

22:09.121 --> 22:10.205
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

22:10.998 --> 22:13.625
You've just been working late
for the last few weeks.

22:13.709 --> 22:15.544
Keep on working. Pizza's fine.

22:17.504 --> 22:19.965
You know, I know another way
to heat up the pizza.

22:20.048 --> 22:21.133
It tastes even better.

22:21.842 --> 22:24.678
I'm kidding, I'm kidding. Stop.
What are you doing?

22:24.761 --> 22:26.847
All right. I'll try it.

22:27.431 --> 22:28.849
Any recs would help.

22:28.932 --> 22:31.143
- Okay, try the Girls Rock section.
- Okay.

22:32.394 --> 22:34.146
Keep going, going.

22:34.229 --> 22:36.607
- Yeah, right there.
- Yeah. Hmm...

22:36.690 --> 22:37.691
Oh!

22:38.984 --> 22:40.736
- Pat Benatar?
- Yes.

22:40.819 --> 22:44.865
She rocks. Always. Trust me.
I remember when I was with our bar band.

22:44.948 --> 22:48.577
"Hit Me With Your Best Shot"
brought the house down every night.

22:48.660 --> 22:51.038
Well, you're right, you're right.

22:52.456 --> 22:54.291
Can I get almond milk with that?

22:54.791 --> 22:56.502
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

23:00.005 --> 23:01.507
So, how's it going?

23:02.549 --> 23:04.343
Eh. Yeah, we're good.

23:05.344 --> 23:07.930
I don't know.
Sol's been maxed out at work.

23:08.013 --> 23:11.183
I swear, he hates his job.

23:11.266 --> 23:13.936
He doesn't even wanna cook anymore,
he's so stressed out.

23:14.019 --> 23:16.438
Why don't you, like, just plan something?

23:16.522 --> 23:18.065
You know, like, something festive.

23:18.148 --> 23:19.733
Get him cooking again.

23:21.735 --> 23:23.028
Thanksgiving.

23:23.111 --> 23:25.822
Your house? Oh.

23:26.823 --> 23:28.242
Oh!

23:29.201 --> 23:30.202
Yo, Sol!

23:31.578 --> 23:33.914
Dust your apron off, bitch!

23:35.958 --> 23:38.210
- Like a break-dancing crew?
- I don't believe you.

23:38.293 --> 23:39.628
- I had a crew.
- No.

23:39.711 --> 23:41.463
- What?
- I had a whole thing, yeah.

23:41.547 --> 23:43.340
- Oh!
- Yum.

23:43.423 --> 23:45.300
- You almost done?
- It's coming. It's coming.

23:45.384 --> 23:47.719
Because it's about to get
really real in here.

23:47.803 --> 23:49.638
- What is happening?
- It's about to get...

23:49.721 --> 23:51.390
- No!
- Kyle!

23:51.473 --> 23:53.308
Um...

23:53.392 --> 23:55.018
- Cleanup on aisle...
- I didn't do it.

23:55.102 --> 23:57.271
- Mom? Help, help, help, please.
- Now you leave.

23:57.354 --> 23:59.398
- Get me salt, white vinegar...
- I got it.

23:59.481 --> 24:00.816
...and dish soap.

24:00.899 --> 24:02.818
- And no more red wine for Kyle.
- Salt.

24:02.901 --> 24:04.736
That's your boy.

24:06.488 --> 24:08.866
- I'm so sorry. My hands are full.
- Mina, hi. No, it's okay.

24:08.949 --> 24:10.325
- There you go.
- Come in, come in.

24:10.409 --> 24:12.411
For you and also for you.

24:12.494 --> 24:14.663
- You inspired it.
- Mina.

24:14.746 --> 24:16.790
- It's gorgeous. Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

24:16.874 --> 24:19.751
- Thank you for having me.
- Please, come in. Hang up your coat.

24:19.835 --> 24:20.919
Baby.

24:23.380 --> 24:24.965
Oh, uh, Mina, Dave. Dave, Mina.

24:25.048 --> 24:26.341
- Hi.
- She's an artist.

24:26.425 --> 24:28.177
- Can I hug you?
- Yeah, sure you can.

24:28.260 --> 24:30.137
Hi. Nice to meet you.

24:30.220 --> 24:33.390
- Look at this painting Mina gave us.
- I love that. That's really cool.

24:33.473 --> 24:36.268
- Order's up. Share with everyone.
- Thank you.

24:37.019 --> 24:38.020
That smells amazing.

24:38.896 --> 24:41.315
Okay. Um...

24:41.398 --> 24:42.566
Cheers.

24:46.862 --> 24:50.824
Oh. I think this couch
is missing a few springs.

24:50.908 --> 24:53.702
Don't insult the couch, man.
Me and this couch have a history.

24:53.785 --> 24:57.623
I spent many weeks sleeping on this
when I was in between... places.

24:57.706 --> 24:59.541
You mean in between girlfriends.

24:59.625 --> 25:02.669
So, the couch is
your longest relationship?

25:04.671 --> 25:06.965
- Ouch.
- Sorry.

25:07.049 --> 25:09.051
Hey, I get it. I like the couch.

25:09.134 --> 25:11.762
I can see that. You are the couch.

25:21.647 --> 25:23.565
- What's in the stuffing?
- Hey, Gigi.

25:23.649 --> 25:28.320
It's sticky rice, shiitake,
Szechuan sausage and coconuts.

25:28.403 --> 25:30.030
Mmm! Hit me.

25:30.113 --> 25:32.199
You're just a head. You look like Zordon.

25:32.282 --> 25:33.408
We're all having fun.

25:33.492 --> 25:35.410
- Careful, it's hot.
- Okay.

25:40.541 --> 25:42.960
Mmm! You just messed me up.

25:43.794 --> 25:45.420
Oh, my God. Szechuan sausage?

25:45.504 --> 25:47.923
You just straight up messed me up.
Hit me again.

25:48.006 --> 25:49.758
- Jenn, your man.
- I know, right?

25:49.842 --> 25:50.968
Come on.

25:51.677 --> 25:54.054
Wait. I would serve this in my restaurant.

25:54.137 --> 25:56.431
- Yeah?
- My chef could use a little inspiration.

25:57.099 --> 26:00.227
You need to come work for me, Sol.
What else do you have here?

26:00.310 --> 26:04.106
Miso carrots, and then we've got
a little bit of garlic bok choy.

26:04.690 --> 26:06.358
This is wonderful.

26:13.615 --> 26:15.576
- Beautiful finish.
- I'm taking a lot.

26:19.746 --> 26:20.914
Corn bread?

26:25.210 --> 26:27.963
- Just load it. Load it.
- Oh, oh!

26:28.046 --> 26:29.840
- You want it all.
- I want it all.

26:31.175 --> 26:33.594
No, no, no, Head Chef. Head of the table.

26:33.677 --> 26:36.680
- Me too. I don't want the middleman here.
- Just waiting for the host.

26:36.763 --> 26:38.056
Grabbing 'em all.

26:38.140 --> 26:39.600
- Good for you.
- Me too.

26:39.683 --> 26:41.602
- Looks amazing, right?
- Thank you.

26:44.021 --> 26:47.441
These carrots
would piss my dad off to no end.

26:47.524 --> 26:49.693
Wait. What? Why?

26:49.776 --> 26:51.987
Because he would spend all day

26:52.070 --> 26:54.781
slaving away in the kitchen
making Thanksgiving dinner,

26:54.865 --> 27:00.120
and then Sol would show up with carrots,
and it'd be the hit of the night.

27:02.539 --> 27:04.583
That's why
I only ever let you make dessert.

27:05.167 --> 27:07.878
Sol, Jenn, I wanna thank you.

27:07.961 --> 27:09.630
If you hadn't invited me tonight,

27:09.713 --> 27:12.049
I'd probably be sitting at home
eating a frozen dinner.

27:12.841 --> 27:14.635
You're so welcome.

27:14.718 --> 27:16.178
Oh! Wait. Hold on.

27:17.638 --> 27:18.639
Mmm.

27:18.722 --> 27:21.934
Sol and I would like to say, um,

27:22.017 --> 27:24.311
thank you, guys, so much
for being here today.

27:24.394 --> 27:26.813
Now our house finally feels like a home.

27:27.481 --> 27:29.858
New friends, new smells,

27:29.942 --> 27:32.277
new stains on my new carpet, but...

27:32.861 --> 27:33.946
No stains!

27:34.029 --> 27:36.990
Yes, thanks to Mom, no stains.
No stains at all.

27:37.074 --> 27:38.867
Oh, yes. I'll do it.

27:38.951 --> 27:41.286
Here we go. I got it, I got it.

27:43.038 --> 27:45.666
- Are you okay?
- My God. Are you okay?

27:45.749 --> 27:48.126
I'm fine.

27:48.210 --> 27:49.837
We're good. That was fun.

27:49.920 --> 27:51.505
- Did you chip a tooth?
- Thank you.

27:51.588 --> 27:54.716
- What happened?
- Also, I just put in my two weeks' notice.

27:55.801 --> 27:57.803
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

27:57.886 --> 28:00.639
You're taking our bed, okay? No arguments.

28:00.722 --> 28:03.141
- You won't get one from me.
- I'll get you set up.

28:05.102 --> 28:06.353
Guys, guys, guys.

28:08.564 --> 28:09.690
- Hey.
- Hey, hey.

28:09.773 --> 28:11.942
Amanda. Kyle, come on.

28:12.025 --> 28:14.736
Okay, so I think we got the three-piece...

28:14.820 --> 28:16.405
We'll just meet at...

28:16.488 --> 28:18.991
Three-piece band confirmed this morning.

28:19.533 --> 28:20.951
Everything's fine.

28:21.034 --> 28:22.035
Hey.

28:23.620 --> 28:25.122
- What?
- Nothing.

28:25.205 --> 28:27.833
Everything's cool. Dinner was great.

28:27.916 --> 28:29.835
You can train, like, crows or magpies

28:29.918 --> 28:34.047
to, like, not be your pet
but kind of be around you.

28:34.131 --> 28:37.092
- I want this whole thing to be...
- I love the way your brain works.

28:37.176 --> 28:39.511
Oh, my God, you're such a dork.
But I'm serious about this.

30:01.593 --> 30:02.719
Jenn,

30:02.803 --> 30:05.305
I'm gonna try and be charming
and witty, okay?

30:08.350 --> 30:13.689
I didn't know how much
I could actually love until I met you.

30:14.982 --> 30:18.026
And it keeps growing every single day.

30:18.944 --> 30:21.822
- Waking up next to you, I feel so lucky.
- Beautiful.

30:21.905 --> 30:23.699
- I feel so... I feel...
- But...

30:23.782 --> 30:25.033
But it's more than luck.

30:26.076 --> 30:28.161
You make me feel like I can do anything.

30:29.371 --> 30:31.164
We can do anything.

30:31.748 --> 30:33.083
And I wanna do it all.

30:35.460 --> 30:36.670
Okay.

30:38.046 --> 30:39.381
Oh, my God.

30:40.757 --> 30:44.094
- Ah!
- Oh, my gosh!

30:46.972 --> 30:49.183
And I've never wanted anything more...

30:51.226 --> 30:53.020
than for you to be my wife.

30:55.022 --> 30:56.148
God.

30:56.231 --> 30:57.399
Now or never.

30:58.734 --> 30:59.735
Yeah.

31:00.944 --> 31:03.280
Yes. Yes! Yes!

31:11.246 --> 31:12.956
- It fits!
- Yeah!

31:13.040 --> 31:15.042
Yes! Yes!

31:15.125 --> 31:16.376
Hey!

31:20.506 --> 31:21.507
Give it up! Yes!

31:21.590 --> 31:24.718
- That was incredible.
- Yeah.

31:30.516 --> 31:31.850
Medallions?

31:31.934 --> 31:33.143
Yeah, right here.

31:37.940 --> 31:39.483
Can I get garnish here?

31:39.566 --> 31:41.610
Not bad for your first week, Chau.

31:41.693 --> 31:43.153
Where's my skirt steak?

31:43.654 --> 31:45.489
- Order up!
- That's for table nine.

31:45.572 --> 31:46.907
- Good.
- Is that medium rare?

31:46.990 --> 31:49.368
- Where's my rib eye? Where's my salmon?
- Yes, Chef.

31:49.451 --> 31:51.119
Waiting on the caramelized onion.

32:17.437 --> 32:19.731
- Something's wrong.
- Sol, are you okay?

32:21.149 --> 32:23.235
Sol!

32:24.736 --> 32:27.155
Sol!

32:32.536 --> 32:33.829
Do you want coffee?

32:35.914 --> 32:37.749
Should I go to your house,
get some clothes?

32:37.833 --> 32:40.169
No, I'm good. Thanks.

32:43.463 --> 32:44.882
Hey.

32:44.965 --> 32:46.425
- Hey.
- What did they say?

32:46.508 --> 32:49.636
Perforated ulcer probably.
It's no big deal.

32:52.806 --> 32:54.474
Megan, you made this sound serious.

32:54.558 --> 32:55.726
They came in an ambulance.

32:55.809 --> 32:58.103
By the time he got here,
he was already feeling better.

32:58.187 --> 32:59.188
All right.

33:00.189 --> 33:01.315
Where's Dave?

33:04.526 --> 33:05.736
Had a date.

33:08.113 --> 33:10.490
Haven't been here since my dad died.

33:15.245 --> 33:18.540
They're probably just gonna give him
some meds and then send him home.

33:18.624 --> 33:20.417
You really don't need to stay.

33:24.838 --> 33:25.923
I'm...

33:30.052 --> 33:31.261
I'm okay.

33:31.887 --> 33:36.558
It's a condition with chronic pain
in the left or right abdominal.

33:36.642 --> 33:38.894
- Symptoms include restless leg syndrome...
- Megs.

33:38.977 --> 33:40.604
- ...sleep...
- Stop googling.

33:40.687 --> 33:43.690
- Jennifer Carter?
- Hi.

33:43.774 --> 33:45.192
Could I have a word?

33:46.568 --> 33:47.569
Of course.

33:54.076 --> 33:56.328
See? Lucky.

33:56.411 --> 34:00.165
That's what they all keep saying.
I am what lucky looks like.

34:00.249 --> 34:01.917
'Cause there's only one.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.126
Yeah.

34:03.210 --> 34:05.921
One sad, lonely tumor
about to get evicted from my liver.

34:06.004 --> 34:08.422
- Gotta get the hell out of there.
- Get outta there!

34:14.304 --> 34:15.722
I'm gonna be fine.

34:18.308 --> 34:19.476
Don't worry.

34:30.529 --> 34:31.822
I love you.

34:32.822 --> 34:34.157
I love you too.

35:00.684 --> 35:01.977
Five more minutes.

35:02.060 --> 35:05.355
We get your results today.
Come on. Let's go.

35:17.659 --> 35:19.328
Hey, if we get bad news...

35:20.662 --> 35:22.164
we should get a dog.

35:22.247 --> 35:25.334
Don't say that. We're getting good news.

35:30.005 --> 35:32.007
Good morning. Sol.

35:32.090 --> 35:33.133
Hey.

35:33.217 --> 35:34.426
- Jenn.
- Hi.

35:40.933 --> 35:42.226
Everything looks good.

35:44.436 --> 35:46.688
Your blood work is normal.

35:47.814 --> 35:50.025
The liver is regenerating nicely.

35:50.108 --> 35:53.362
- Ow! Jenn.
- Sorry. Sorry.

35:53.445 --> 35:57.491
We'll do a follow-up in six weeks,
but we might as well get on with it.

35:57.574 --> 36:01.245
And you two can get on
with that wedding of yours.

36:02.329 --> 36:04.456
Okay. I'll get out the wine in the fridge.

36:04.540 --> 36:07.251
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God! This is so amazing.

36:07.334 --> 36:08.752
- Whoo!
- What a relief.

Yes, Chef. I'll make it up.

- Got it.

Let's go. Pick it up. Thank you.

How we doing on that, Chau?

37:37.966 --> 37:39.635
- Here you go, Chef.
- Hey, home run.

37:39.718 --> 37:41.512
That's a permanent addition to the menu.

37:44.765 --> 37:47.142
How you feeling? Your energy good?

37:47.226 --> 37:48.727
Good, good. I'm good.

37:48.810 --> 37:51.063
How do people live without a liver?

37:51.146 --> 37:53.440
They don't. I mean, I don't.

37:53.524 --> 37:56.193
They only took a third. It's growing back.

37:56.276 --> 37:57.778
It grows back?

37:57.861 --> 38:00.239
Yeah, the liver is like
our one X-Men organ.

38:00.322 --> 38:01.949
Did you hear that, Neil?

38:02.658 --> 38:04.868
You're cooking with a real-life superhero.

38:08.288 --> 38:09.414
Go, Chef.

38:09.498 --> 38:10.874
All right, order up!

38:10.958 --> 38:12.251
Sol, Jenn's here.

38:12.793 --> 38:14.002
I'll let Gigi explain.

38:14.086 --> 38:16.129
You have to use your imagination
a little bit,

38:16.213 --> 38:19.466
but after the wedding,
the doors will open, everyone'll come out.

38:19.550 --> 38:21.301
- Then there's lights...
- Okay.

38:21.385 --> 38:23.804
- ...everywhere, and flowers.
- Forget about the things around.

38:23.887 --> 38:26.265
- Clean all this junk up.
- We'll move all this stuff.

38:26.348 --> 38:27.975
It would make it a lot bigger, yeah?

38:28.058 --> 38:29.601
- Yeah.
- If we open that up?

38:29.685 --> 38:32.396
It'll all be open,
so it'll feel like one big space.

38:32.479 --> 38:33.689
It'll be really nice.

38:33.772 --> 38:35.899
- I mean, this is kinda perfect, isn't it?
- It is.

38:35.983 --> 38:37.192
It's kind of...

38:37.276 --> 38:39.361
Perfect? It's gravel.

38:39.987 --> 38:42.447
You cannot dance on gravel.

38:44.283 --> 38:45.951
- Hey.
- Cool. Everyone's here.

38:46.034 --> 38:47.244
Welcome.

38:47.327 --> 38:49.788
I thought you were gonna be here
a half hour ago...

38:49.872 --> 38:51.748
The driver got lost... Is this...

38:51.832 --> 38:53.500
Yeah. Okay.

38:53.584 --> 38:56.003
No, I'm not letting you guys
get married here. Nope.

38:56.086 --> 38:59.548
Okay. No, no, I knew you wouldn't see it,
but you can see it now. Watch.

38:59.631 --> 39:03.385
A DJ booth in the corner,
playing awesome music. See?

39:03.468 --> 39:06.096
- Here? Dance right here?
- We're dancing already!

39:06.180 --> 39:07.181
Come on.

39:07.264 --> 39:10.434
Yeah, don't think about how it looks,
think about how it feels.

39:10.517 --> 39:12.102
Yes, how it feels.

39:53.602 --> 39:55.854
No, no, don't! Put me down!

39:55.938 --> 39:58.148
- We're getting married!
- Do not throw me in!

39:58.232 --> 40:01.318
- He got a Jenn Chau...
- No!

40:01.401 --> 40:03.320
...going in the lake!

40:06.490 --> 40:07.783
What are you doing?

40:09.034 --> 40:10.244
Left, right.

40:10.327 --> 40:12.704
We do not need to practice.
It's a slow dance.

40:12.788 --> 40:16.333
- Yes, we do, 'cause we need to do...
- What... Oh, wow. A spin.

40:16.416 --> 40:17.709
- Okay.
- Yes. Yes.

40:17.793 --> 40:20.963
I know. No, I just want a huggy dance.

40:22.005 --> 40:23.090
Please?

40:27.261 --> 40:29.638
This is all I want on my wedding day.

40:32.474 --> 40:34.184
Except we'll be dancing on gravel.

40:34.268 --> 40:38.438
We could be at Chuck E. Cheese
and I would still be smiling.

40:39.690 --> 40:42.150
- Well, that's not a bad idea.
- Mm-hmm.

40:53.787 --> 40:56.874
This is not what I wanted to do today.

40:56.957 --> 40:59.668
How long is this voluntary torture?

40:59.751 --> 41:01.795
It's, like, 90 minutes or something.

41:01.879 --> 41:03.255
Nine-zero?

41:03.338 --> 41:04.548
Mm-hmm.

41:04.631 --> 41:06.091
Look at these lanterns.

41:06.633 --> 41:09.720
- Look. Jenn, look left. Look.
- What?

41:09.803 --> 41:12.723
Oh, sorry.
They're switching Sol's medication today.

41:12.806 --> 41:15.517
He said he would text me.
Okay. Show me what you got.

41:15.601 --> 41:17.060
Okay. One...

41:17.144 --> 41:18.437
- That's beautiful.
- I know.

41:18.520 --> 41:22.107
Don't get too excited about that.
We don't have a lantern budget.

41:22.191 --> 41:23.317
- Wait for it.
- Yeah?

41:24.902 --> 41:26.528
Oh, my God.

41:26.612 --> 41:27.779
Look at that dress.

41:27.863 --> 41:30.782
- What?
- Simple, elegant. Look at the V.

41:30.866 --> 41:35.537
No. That's, like, $10,000.
You are scrambling her bride brain, Megs.

41:35.621 --> 41:37.831
Okay, you got this.

41:37.915 --> 41:41.919
Okay. We got this! We got this!

41:42.002 --> 41:44.505
Do we got it? Do we got it?

41:46.798 --> 41:49.551
Okay, one and down.

41:50.344 --> 41:53.805
All right, I don't wanna see those knees
coming forward, y'all.

41:54.932 --> 41:56.850
I know. You like that one.

41:58.101 --> 42:01.897
Dig deep, y'all, for some burpees.
We're gonna reach to the sky, okay?

42:01.980 --> 42:05.108
- Burpee?
- And up... and down!

42:05.192 --> 42:06.693
What the heck is this thing?

42:06.777 --> 42:08.570
Up! And reach for the sky

42:08.654 --> 42:10.364
and touch the ground.

42:12.157 --> 42:15.035
- I'll be right back.
- Come on, y'all. And squat...

42:15.118 --> 42:16.286
and jump.

42:16.370 --> 42:17.913
Now reach and stretch it up...

42:17.996 --> 42:19.873
We're not doing that one anymore?

42:23.335 --> 42:24.837
And bounce it out.

42:30.217 --> 42:31.760
His name is Otis.

42:33.804 --> 42:35.138
He's ours.

42:39.768 --> 42:41.395
Why do we have a dog?

42:45.649 --> 42:47.609
Why do we have a dog?

43:00.914 --> 43:04.334
Mendelson said the level of aggression
is very concerning.

43:28.525 --> 43:31.236
Absolute worst-case scenario
is six months.

43:38.452 --> 43:41.955
He said he can get us
into a brand-new clinical trial.

43:42.956 --> 43:45.250
Four months of radiation,

43:45.334 --> 43:48.712
- coupled up with chemo, combined...
- Sol.

43:50.047 --> 43:54.718
Hey. Hey, hey.
I think that there are options, okay?

43:55.344 --> 43:58.847
He seemed pretty positive
about this being the best path.

44:00.516 --> 44:01.558
Hey.

44:03.602 --> 44:05.062
I'm gonna beat this.

44:06.396 --> 44:07.523
I will.

44:08.857 --> 44:10.526
- Okay.
- All right.

44:13.904 --> 44:17.741
And then how it all
kinda piles on and... I don't know.

44:17.824 --> 44:21.828
I know.
But, like, he can't keep working, can he?

44:21.912 --> 44:24.498
Well, he wants to.
I mean, as much as possible.

44:24.581 --> 44:27.209
But realistically,
he's only gonna be able to, I don't know,

44:27.292 --> 44:31.004
be there two, maybe three times a week
once chemo starts, and then it's just...

44:31.088 --> 44:33.882
Okay.

44:35.509 --> 44:38.470
So what about, uh, the wedding?

44:40.305 --> 44:41.723
You guys still gonna do that?

44:42.975 --> 44:44.643
We gotta postpone.

44:44.726 --> 44:47.396
We have to cut costs and cut stress.

44:47.479 --> 44:49.022
He'll be in remission by August.

44:49.106 --> 44:51.233
Yeah, but with no immune system.

44:51.984 --> 44:53.777
Well, what can we do?

44:54.945 --> 44:57.114
I mean, like, what can we do for you?

45:00.450 --> 45:01.743
I don't know.

45:08.542 --> 45:10.252
I'm sorry. Traffic.

45:10.335 --> 45:13.505
- Hey, Hope.
- Hey. Hey.

45:13.589 --> 45:14.840
So, where's Kyle?

45:14.923 --> 45:17.342
I don't know. I've been trying him.
Disappeared on Sol.

45:17.426 --> 45:19.386
Come on.
He's going through a really hard time,

45:19.469 --> 45:21.513
considering everything
that he just went through.

45:21.597 --> 45:22.973
It's not about him.

45:23.056 --> 45:25.100
Okay, so what's the plan?

45:25.184 --> 45:27.519
I think that they want
a really nice wedding.

45:28.353 --> 45:31.523
And I think we should give them one
as soon as possible.

45:31.607 --> 45:34.234
To have everyone around,
watching their first dance.

45:34.318 --> 45:38.697
To have yummy food and champagne
and just make it really special for them.

45:38.780 --> 45:40.866
And I think that would be so fantastic.

45:40.949 --> 45:42.993
It would be. It would be fantastic.

45:43.076 --> 45:44.244
How?

45:49.124 --> 45:50.459
Come on, buddy.

46:08.977 --> 46:12.689
<i>Dr. Marcus to Room 329.</i>

46:12.773 --> 46:13.941
That okay?

46:14.816 --> 46:16.818
- Yeah. It's okay. Thanks.
- Okay.

46:17.694 --> 46:20.405
- I'm good.
- Come on, Otis.

46:20.489 --> 46:23.909
He's had too many sausage tacos.

46:23.992 --> 46:26.245
Does the dog come with the place too?

46:26.328 --> 46:28.705
Uh, no. He's ours.

46:28.789 --> 46:32.334
Oh. Figured they'd tack it
to my bill or something.

46:40.300 --> 46:43.846
You should read a good book.
A book would take you out of all this.

46:45.681 --> 46:48.600
I should be at spring break
reading a bar menu right now.

46:49.852 --> 46:51.478
Oh, spring break happens every year.

46:54.022 --> 46:56.567
There's a one-in-five chance
that I don't see next year.

46:59.903 --> 47:01.530
You could flip the numbers.

47:02.531 --> 47:04.283
Four out of five you do.

47:09.913 --> 47:11.540
What about you two?

47:11.623 --> 47:13.750
You guys got any plans after all this?

47:13.834 --> 47:17.921
Well, eventually get married,
go on a honeymoon.

47:18.005 --> 47:19.506
Somewhere tropical.

47:19.590 --> 47:21.425
My vote is the Bahamas.

47:21.508 --> 47:24.636
Yeah, I'm bringing my red Speedo
and tanning oil.

47:24.720 --> 47:26.847
No, absolutely not.

47:26.930 --> 47:29.516
No tanning oil for either of you.

47:30.225 --> 47:32.186
- No Speedos, either.
- Okay.

47:32.269 --> 47:34.646
I will give you the benefit of distraction
one more time.

47:34.730 --> 47:37.232
- You see? You see that?
- Look at what? Nothing happened!

47:37.316 --> 47:39.484
- Nothing happened!
- Did you? A little bit, but...

47:39.568 --> 47:40.903
They're here. They're here.

47:41.612 --> 47:43.030
Uh, hey, guys.

47:43.113 --> 47:44.573
- Hey.
- Hey.

47:44.656 --> 47:45.991
- Hi.
- Hi.

47:46.074 --> 47:47.367
What's up?

47:47.451 --> 47:49.453
I mean, we know you guys
are strapped for cash

47:49.536 --> 47:51.538
'cause of all the medical bills and stuff,

47:51.622 --> 47:53.582
but we don't want you
to put your life on hold.

47:53.665 --> 47:56.126
So, some of us thought that
we should ask for your permission,

47:56.210 --> 47:57.461
but you really can't say no.

47:57.544 --> 47:59.254
- Megan.
- It's kind of already happening.

47:59.338 --> 48:02.132
- The wheels are in motion.
- Wait. Whoa, whoa. What's happening?

48:02.216 --> 48:03.800
Neil and Gigi are on food.

48:03.884 --> 48:05.969
Chris has a hookup with flowers,
and drinks, of course.

48:06.053 --> 48:08.972
Guys, weddings take months to plan.

48:09.056 --> 48:10.807
And yours will take three weeks.

48:11.600 --> 48:15.479
And we already did the math.
$20,000 should cover it.

48:15.562 --> 48:18.440
But we're handling it.

48:18.524 --> 48:22.236
First things first.
We should ask for their permission.

48:29.743 --> 48:32.412
Now, each of us donated $200.

48:33.205 --> 48:35.791
- Just, you know, get it started.
- Yeah.

48:35.874 --> 48:37.835
I'm gonna e-mail everyone at my office.

48:37.918 --> 48:39.878
And I can e-mail my whole client list.

48:39.962 --> 48:42.130
We have a couple
of fundraiser ideas that...

48:42.631 --> 48:44.132
Yeah.

48:44.216 --> 48:49.179
Guys, we're really touched,
but this just seems impossible.

48:50.305 --> 48:53.725
You know, we're asking for a lot of money
from friends and strangers.

48:54.601 --> 48:55.894
I don't know.

48:56.478 --> 48:57.896
Hey.

48:58.522 --> 48:59.940
We can do this.

49:01.108 --> 49:02.818
And you deserve it.

49:04.069 --> 49:05.487
What do you think?

49:12.578 --> 49:13.579

50:55.597 --> 50:57.224
Oh!

50:57.307 --> 50:58.892
This room books a year out minimum,

50:58.976 --> 51:01.270
but we had this nightmare
on the books for the 11th.

51:01.353 --> 51:05.148
Brats throwing an anniversary party for
their parents, fighting the whole time.

51:05.232 --> 51:09.152
I pulled the plug on their whole affair
with one tug. Yoink.

51:09.820 --> 51:12.406
Of course, we are so happy
that this is now available

51:12.489 --> 51:14.491

You're welcome.

51:18.537 --> 51:21.999
I... I mean, we...
How can we ever thank you for that?

51:22.082 --> 51:23.959
- That is so generous.
- Yeah.

51:24.042 --> 51:26.086
- This is beyond...
- Let's hug this out later, kids.

51:26.170 --> 51:29.381
We spoke on the phone
about us handling the food ourselves.

51:29.464 --> 51:31.383
Sol's a chef.

51:31.466 --> 51:32.801
That makes my life easy-peasy.

51:32.885 --> 51:34.553
Time to talk booze.

51:34.636 --> 51:38.098

You're gonna need a signature drink,

51:38.182 --> 51:40.559
- so who's up for a morning tasting?
- Yes.

51:40.642 --> 51:43.187
Uh-huh. Me too. Following you.

51:43.270 --> 51:45.731
Oh, my God.

51:45.814 --> 51:47.649
- This is crazy.
- Wow.

51:49.234 --> 51:51.278
Do you have more of this?

51:51.361 --> 51:53.822
Ready?

51:53.906 --> 51:56.241
- Oh!
- Yes. Oh, my God.

51:59.620 --> 52:02.372
- Wow!
- Yeah...

52:02.456 --> 52:03.665
It's not the one.

52:03.749 --> 52:07.044
It's a gorgeous dress.
It's just not necessarily right for me.

52:07.127 --> 52:08.879
- Okay. Okay.
- That's right.

52:08.962 --> 52:11.673
- And it's way too expensive.
- Oh, no, no.

52:11.757 --> 52:15.552
No matter what dress you choose,
there are no price tags.

52:17.221 --> 52:19.932
That's very sweet. Thank you.

52:20.015 --> 52:22.434
Oh, my God. I found it.

52:25.521 --> 52:28.941
Megan. It's the one.

52:31.235 --> 52:33.654
Look at this. "I'm a tin suit man."

52:39.701 --> 52:40.702
Hmm.

52:42.538 --> 52:46.041
Whoa! I am not paying
this much for a suit.

52:46.124 --> 52:49.628
You're not paying for anything.
People donated to your wedding.

52:49.711 --> 52:53.298
You can't show up like some schlub
in an ill-fitting suit.

52:53.382 --> 52:56.176
They're gonna think
you ripped them off. Hmm?

52:58.846 --> 53:03.100
Besides, the best man
can't be the best dressed.

53:04.393 --> 53:05.519
He can be the best looking,

53:05.602 --> 53:07.020
but not the best dressed.

53:15.445 --> 53:16.697
Man, you know, um...

53:17.531 --> 53:19.741
I asked Kyle to come down here.

53:20.659 --> 53:25.205
Jenn said it's like a...
like a form of PTSD.

53:26.081 --> 53:29.793
You know, he was working with his dad,
side by side, until he got sick.

53:29.877 --> 53:32.129
Must have been hard
watching him lose his battle.

53:32.212 --> 53:33.589
Yeah, maybe so.

53:34.548 --> 53:36.216
But I wouldn't expect much from him.

53:40.429 --> 53:41.847
Yeah, it's all good.

53:44.224 --> 53:47.144
Only a couple more days, bro.

53:56.403 --> 53:58.363
Oh, God. Look at this tub.

53:59.239 --> 54:01.158
And this view.

54:02.451 --> 54:04.369
- It's nice.
- Yeah, right?

54:18.967 --> 54:20.552
Tastes like copper.

54:23.847 --> 54:26.266
They warned you Keytruda
might dull your taste buds.

54:26.350 --> 54:27.726
Yeah.

54:28.560 --> 54:31.855
You know, I have every single side effect
from every single drug.

54:31.939 --> 54:34.191
Migraines, stomach pains.

54:34.274 --> 54:35.359
I know.

54:36.485 --> 54:39.238
You know, the clinical trials
promise even more bonuses.

54:39.988 --> 54:43.033
Diarrhea, fun mouth sores and...

54:48.830 --> 54:50.791
Maybe it's a sign it's all working.

54:52.501 --> 54:55.295
Just... Just feels like a lot right now,
I'm sorry.

54:55.379 --> 54:58.590
That's okay. Look, no problem.
We'll skip the honeymoon.

55:05.848 --> 55:07.432
Maybe we skip all of it.

55:09.935 --> 55:11.103
The wedding?

55:16.066 --> 55:18.318
Jenn, it's gonna all be on display.

55:18.402 --> 55:22.781
And there's just a lot of people and then,
like, you're gonna be this sad spectacle.

55:22.865 --> 55:25.617
- And I don't want you to be...
- Sol, hey. Hey.

55:25.701 --> 55:28.787
This is gonna be
the happiest day of our lives.

55:31.248 --> 55:33.375
I get to be your bride.

55:34.543 --> 55:36.503
Walking down the aisle to you.

55:38.297 --> 55:40.716
People will just see a widow in white.

55:44.052 --> 55:45.846
Why would you say that?

55:46.805 --> 55:49.183
- I don't want...
- Don't say that. That's...

55:49.975 --> 55:53.395
I just... Look, I just can't keep
doing this to you, okay?

55:55.480 --> 55:58.609
The mood swings, the side effects, and...

55:58.692 --> 56:01.028
It's just getting really hard right now
and I...

56:01.111 --> 56:03.822
- Hey, um, I'm... I'm gonna make some tea.
- Jenn, I'm just...

56:03.906 --> 56:06.408
- I'm just trying to tell you, it's...
- No, I'm gonna...

56:25.093 --> 56:27.179
Maybe I should stop treatment.

56:30.098 --> 56:31.099
What?

56:32.976 --> 56:34.061
Sol?

56:36.772 --> 56:39.149
I am in this with you.

56:40.442 --> 56:43.612
Okay? We knew that this was gonna be hard.

56:48.951 --> 56:50.702
So is that what's happening now?

56:50.786 --> 56:52.955
You're just gonna start
making decisions without me?

56:53.038 --> 56:55.082
You don't understand
what I'm going through right now.

56:55.165 --> 56:56.667
- I want to.
- No, you don't want to.

56:56.750 --> 57:00.212
Yes, I do. Do not tell me
what I want to and don't want to.

57:00.295 --> 57:01.797
I don't want you to know.

57:03.882 --> 57:06.385
Let's just make it easier
for both of us, okay?

57:07.302 --> 57:11.640
God, you are being
such a selfish prick right now!

57:11.723 --> 57:13.684
- I'm being selfish? I'm being...
- Yes!

57:14.685 --> 57:16.895
You don't get to choose when I tap out.

57:16.979 --> 57:20.440
- Well, do I get to choose?
- Not alone. Not anymore.

57:31.451 --> 57:32.578
Sol?

57:34.454 --> 57:35.789
Sol, you...

57:35.873 --> 57:38.500
You don't know what this feels like, okay?

57:39.168 --> 57:41.086
Well, then explain it to me.

57:42.796 --> 57:45.549
Explain it to me,
and then we can talk about it.

57:45.632 --> 57:49.595
If you explain it to me, then I can help.
Then I can... We can fix this.

57:49.678 --> 57:53.515
It would be much easier
if I was alone with my meds and my doctor

57:53.599 --> 57:55.642
and my... end!

58:59.748 --> 59:02.251
Do you remember what I said
when you moved in, Sol?

59:04.378 --> 59:05.629
We had a deal.

59:07.714 --> 59:11.134
You promised you were gonna step up
when it was time to step up.

59:11.218 --> 59:12.553
No regrets.

59:14.596 --> 59:16.265
Please keep your word.

59:18.976 --> 59:20.269
Jenn...

59:28.986 --> 59:31.238
I can't taste anything.

59:32.197 --> 59:35.492
The meds that are supposed
to be helping me took my sense of taste.

59:37.077 --> 59:38.370
I'm a chef.

59:40.038 --> 59:42.791
They couldn't take away the others.
Instead, they take taste?

59:44.084 --> 59:47.004
If they took sight,
you wouldn't be able to see me.

59:49.047 --> 59:52.134
And if they took hearing,
you wouldn't be able to hear my voice.

59:54.678 --> 59:56.263
If they took touch,

59:57.014 --> 59:58.932
you couldn't feel this.

1:00:01.602 --> 1:00:03.353
No early goodbyes.

1:00:04.479 --> 1:00:05.898
No giving up.

1:00:09.818 --> 1:00:11.737
I'm no widow, Sol.

1:00:11.820 --> 1:00:13.447
I am your bride.

1:00:14.406 --> 1:00:16.658
And that is all you're allowed to see.

1:00:35.844 --> 1:00:37.346
Let's go get married.

1:00:39.932 --> 1:00:42.267
- Got two more?
- I need more tablecloths.

1:00:42.351 --> 1:00:44.353
Gotta get this champagne on ice, guys.

1:00:45.187 --> 1:00:47.064
- These going inside?
- Yep.

1:00:47.147 --> 1:00:48.941
Everything inside, to the left.

1:00:49.942 --> 1:00:52.027
Give me a second,
I'm getting it from the back.

1:00:52.986 --> 1:00:55.531
And you don't think it will look too dark
if we do it like this?

1:00:55.614 --> 1:00:56.949
I love this song.

1:01:01.453 --> 1:01:03.413
I don't know what I'm looking for.

1:01:03.497 --> 1:01:05.916
It's nothing. Just look for some soap.

1:01:05.999 --> 1:01:07.793
This song is my jam!

1:01:07.876 --> 1:01:09.670
- Mom?
- Yeah?

1:01:10.504 --> 1:01:12.464
- Is everything okay?
- Sure.

1:01:14.258 --> 1:01:16.969
Okay, um, there's a little mark
on your dress. It's not much.

1:01:17.052 --> 1:01:18.428
- It's not...
- Amanda!

1:01:18.512 --> 1:01:21.098
- Are you kidding me?
- She's overreacting. She's completely...

1:01:21.181 --> 1:01:23.141
- It's a little wine. A little wine.
- Rosé won't stain.

1:01:23.225 --> 1:01:26.311
What are you talking about? Rosé is red.
Mandy, this is two strikes.

1:01:26.395 --> 1:01:29.314
Guys, as long as the stain's
not on my butt, I don't care.

1:01:29.398 --> 1:01:32.985
Step aside, boys. Hot shoes
coming through. Where's Sol? Sol?

1:01:33.068 --> 1:01:34.278
Yeah, hold on.

1:01:34.361 --> 1:01:36.363
Jerome, come try Dave's Margarita.

1:01:36.446 --> 1:01:38.365
I'm working.
I don't drink while I'm working.

1:01:38.448 --> 1:01:40.868
Chris, can you have Gigi
check the kitchen?

1:01:40.951 --> 1:01:42.202
Make sure nothing's overcooked.

1:01:42.286 --> 1:01:44.329
Everything can survive
if it's a little undercooked.

1:01:44.413 --> 1:01:46.957
And the octopus needs to be charred
for at least...

1:01:47.040 --> 1:01:48.917
Octopus will be fine, man. Just relax.

1:01:49.001 --> 1:01:51.545
Do not worry about this, please.

1:01:51.628 --> 1:01:55.048
Everything's gonna be incredible.
I will talk to the chef, okay?

1:01:55.132 --> 1:01:56.675
Yeah, okay.

1:01:58.802 --> 1:01:59.970
Oh, yeah.

1:02:02.639 --> 1:02:04.850
- Chris. Chris.
- Yeah, sure. Okay, yes.

1:02:04.933 --> 1:02:07.186
- Yeah. Let me just get that.
- Thank you.

1:02:09.897 --> 1:02:11.273
Big day, dude.

1:02:13.233 --> 1:02:16.445
It's gonna be perfect.
Just like you and Jenn.

1:02:17.279 --> 1:02:19.698
Maybe not as perfect
as my margarita, but...

1:02:25.245 --> 1:02:26.955
- What's this?
- Open it.

1:02:29.333 --> 1:02:31.043
Find what you love and do it.

1:02:31.126 --> 1:02:32.878
Don't wait.

1:02:32.961 --> 1:02:34.671
Dude, these are fire.

1:02:36.465 --> 1:02:38.342
Never forget chance.

1:02:39.092 --> 1:02:40.511
I'll go put them on.

1:02:44.598 --> 1:02:47.392
- Straight?
- Look like a million bucks.

1:03:44.700 --> 1:03:47.369
We...

1:03:48.787 --> 1:03:51.999
Okay. Ooh...

1:03:52.082 --> 1:03:53.333
Okay.

1:03:53.417 --> 1:03:56.795
We are gathered here today
for Jenn and Sol.

1:03:57.838 --> 1:04:00.716
Two people who give us all hope...

1:04:01.300 --> 1:04:03.385
that true love does exist.

1:04:04.678 --> 1:04:07.639
Um, you know that everyone here

1:04:08.515 --> 1:04:12.186
stepped up to make this happen,
because we know you

1:04:12.269 --> 1:04:14.229
and because we love you.

1:04:15.814 --> 1:04:17.482
Oh, my God.

1:04:17.566 --> 1:04:20.360
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
I can't do this.

1:04:20.444 --> 1:04:23.197
I'll do this. All right, um...

1:04:23.280 --> 1:04:25.824
Wow, a lot of metaphors, Megs.

1:04:31.830 --> 1:04:33.415
You guys are the real deal.

1:04:34.166 --> 1:04:40.672
I have never known a couple
whose love is as deep as Jenn and Sol's.

1:04:41.590 --> 1:04:44.134
- Oh, my God. This is so hard.
- I know.

1:04:44.760 --> 1:04:46.720
Just say your vows, man.

1:04:57.940 --> 1:04:59.358
Jenn Carter...

1:05:02.569 --> 1:05:05.072
I vow to never stop loving you.

1:05:07.157 --> 1:05:08.659
Because of you...

1:05:10.285 --> 1:05:12.287
I have found someone in me...

1:05:13.789 --> 1:05:15.666
that I never would have known.

1:05:17.042 --> 1:05:19.169
Someone that I never would have become.

1:05:21.672 --> 1:05:23.006
You found me.

1:05:25.509 --> 1:05:27.094
You found me.

1:05:29.972 --> 1:05:31.139
Thank you.

1:05:32.683 --> 1:05:35.102
Thank you for showing me what home is...

1:05:36.311 --> 1:05:37.604
what living is,

1:05:38.105 --> 1:05:40.607
and for showing me that I can be great.

1:05:41.984 --> 1:05:43.402
I love all of you.

1:05:44.194 --> 1:05:46.321
With all I have.

1:05:47.948 --> 1:05:49.241
And I will...

1:05:52.160 --> 1:05:53.412
all my life.

1:06:03.755 --> 1:06:05.507
Solomon Chau.

1:06:05.591 --> 1:06:07.342
When I first met you...

1:06:08.635 --> 1:06:11.305
on our first date
at the farmers' market...

1:06:13.307 --> 1:06:18.228
I will always remember this moment
where I turned to find you...

1:06:19.438 --> 1:06:21.523
and just for one second, I couldn't.

1:06:24.026 --> 1:06:27.946
And even though I had just met you,
I missed you.

1:06:31.116 --> 1:06:33.994
Every morning, I wake up

1:06:34.912 --> 1:06:36.580
and I choose you.

1:06:38.582 --> 1:06:39.917
I choose us.

1:06:40.501 --> 1:06:41.835
I choose this.

1:06:45.005 --> 1:06:50.052
I vow to never stop loving you.

1:06:56.475 --> 1:06:57.768
Kiss him!

1:06:59.645 --> 1:07:00.896
Kiss, yes.

1:07:20.165 --> 1:07:24.044
Ladies and gentlemen,
for the first time as husband and wife,

1:07:24.127 --> 1:07:25.838
Sol and Jenn.

1:07:39.101 --> 1:07:41.353

1:09:06.604 --> 1:09:08.232
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1:09:15.863 --> 1:09:17.658
Hey, Sol. Hey, bro.

1:09:17.741 --> 1:09:19.158
Oh!

1:09:19.243 --> 1:09:21.328
Glad you're here. I'll see you in a bit.

1:09:22.621 --> 1:09:25.207
This is very important. Just a taste.

1:09:25.290 --> 1:09:26.875
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay.

1:09:28.710 --> 1:09:31.255
- Aw! Say cheese!
- Hey, get a room, y'all!

1:09:31.337 --> 1:09:33.799
- Here you go. It's all yours.
- Thanks, Sol!

1:09:50.691 --> 1:09:51.984
This is perfect.

1:09:53.569 --> 1:09:54.736
You were right.

1:09:57.155 --> 1:09:58.782
I know that I'm right.

1:09:59.533 --> 1:10:02.202
You gotta trust me. I'm the wife.

1:10:04.454 --> 1:10:05.873
I'm glad we did this.

1:10:07.749 --> 1:10:09.251
No matter what happens.

1:10:11.628 --> 1:10:13.714
What happens next is you get better.

1:10:15.424 --> 1:10:16.758
You know what I mean.

1:10:29.062 --> 1:10:30.814
What? Okay. Wait, wait, wait.
What are you...

1:10:30.898 --> 1:10:32.649
- This wasn't a now or never, Sol.
- Jenn.

1:10:32.733 --> 1:10:34.109
- Jenn...
- Not a now or never.

1:10:34.193 --> 1:10:35.277
No.

1:10:36.069 --> 1:10:37.571
Only now, Sol.

1:10:38.238 --> 1:10:39.323
- Only now!
- No!

1:10:39.406 --> 1:10:41.617
Ah! It's cold!

1:10:44.786 --> 1:10:46.205
Yes!

1:10:48.790 --> 1:10:51.418
What? Are you just gonna stand there?

1:10:52.002 --> 1:10:53.253
Come on.

1:10:57.382 --> 1:10:59.468
- Look, Jenn!
- Do it!

1:11:09.686 --> 1:11:11.063
Yeah!

1:11:11.772 --> 1:11:14.149
Yeah!

1:11:42.469 --> 1:11:43.637
Little more.

1:11:45.556 --> 1:11:47.307
You stay still now, all right?

1:11:47.391 --> 1:11:48.725
Here we go.

1:12:23.719 --> 1:12:27.014
The cancer has spread to the entire area.

1:12:38.108 --> 1:12:41.945
We're moving into
quality-of-life considerations.

1:12:43.405 --> 1:12:46.325
If there are any questions
that aren't easy to ask,

1:12:47.075 --> 1:12:48.744
you need to ask them.

1:12:49.953 --> 1:12:51.163
Um...

1:12:52.789 --> 1:12:55.375
I can't think of any questions right now.

1:12:56.627 --> 1:12:58.670
Not questions for me.

1:12:58.754 --> 1:13:00.756
Questions to ask Sol.

1:13:36.959 --> 1:13:38.502
I'm sorry.

1:14:02.609 --> 1:14:04.403
I'll be up in a second, okay?

1:14:04.486 --> 1:14:05.737
I'm just gonna park.

1:14:15.747 --> 1:14:16.832
Buddy.

1:14:45.194 --> 1:14:46.445
No!

1:14:47.821 --> 1:14:48.906
No!

1:14:49.573 --> 1:14:53.660
No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1:14:54.286 --> 1:14:57.331
No! No! No! No!

1:15:41.750 --> 1:15:43.752
Hey. Is there room for me?

1:15:44.253 --> 1:15:45.879
There's always room for you.

1:15:47.631 --> 1:15:48.882
Who you rooting for?

1:15:52.010 --> 1:15:53.512
Stumpy arms.

1:16:00.769 --> 1:16:01.812
Oh.

1:16:05.274 --> 1:16:06.567
How's that?

1:16:07.651 --> 1:16:08.735
Good.

1:16:33.760 --> 1:16:34.887
Thank you.

It's almost finished.

1:18:13.944 --> 1:18:15.320
Read it to me.

Yeah.

it didn't seem like a lot of time.</i>

1:19:11.668 --> 1:19:14.755
<i>But then again, how many days
do we remember anyway?</i>

1:19:16.298 --> 1:19:18.217
<i>But everything can change.</i>

1:19:19.301 --> 1:19:20.552
<i>In a day.</i>

1:19:21.386 --> 1:19:22.471
<i>In an instant.</i>

1:19:22.554 --> 1:19:24.139
Guys. It's amazing.

1:19:24.223 --> 1:19:27.309
<i>And what might be missing
becomes so very clear.</i>

1:19:28.477 --> 1:19:31.271
- <i>Thankfully, for me, for all of us...</i>
- Show me around.

1:19:31.355 --> 1:19:33.982
- <i>...Sol made it clear.</i>
- Guys, Jenn's here.

1:19:34.066 --> 1:19:37.486
<i>A full life can't be
a series of forgotten days.</i>

1:19:37.569 --> 1:19:39.696
- Welcome.
- Legit!

1:19:39.780 --> 1:19:42.074
<i>If you're not happy, change.</i>

1:19:42.157 --> 1:19:44.701
<i>Shift gears. Take a chance.</i>

1:19:45.369 --> 1:19:47.454
<i>Later is not guaranteed.</i>

1:19:48.413 --> 1:19:51.250
<i>Life is not meant to be lived later.</i>

1:19:53.252 --> 1:19:55.420
<i>Sol always looked for moments.</i>

1:19:56.088 --> 1:19:57.840
<i>A laugh, a kiss,</i>

1:19:57.923 --> 1:20:00.467
<i>a taste, a dance.</i>

1:20:01.343 --> 1:20:03.262
<i>That was his gift to us.</i>

1:20:03.929 --> 1:20:07.558
<i>Reminding us to collect moments every day.</i>

1:20:08.350 --> 1:20:10.644
<i>Because in finding those moments,</i>

1:20:10.727 --> 1:20:12.688
<i>days will never blur.</i>

1:20:14.481 --> 1:20:17.693
<i>In those moments, you will find yourself.</i>

1:20:26.034 --> 1:20:27.202
Jenn?

1:20:31.665 --> 1:20:34.168
There isn't a better time than right now.

1:20:35.419 --> 1:20:36.587
Okay.

1:20:37.880 --> 1:20:40.674
Can't believe you guys
managed to keep this a secret.

1:20:41.884 --> 1:20:43.552
He made us promise.

1:20:45.179 --> 1:20:46.889
I'm scared.

1:20:46.972 --> 1:20:49.933
Oh, no, no.
There's nothing to be scared of.

1:20:50.017 --> 1:20:51.435
We should go to the pool.

1:20:53.395 --> 1:20:54.813
Meet us there?

1:20:54.897 --> 1:20:56.940
Midday frozen cocktails, I think,

1:20:57.024 --> 1:20:59.818
are just really good for the soul,
and I...

1:20:59.902 --> 1:21:02.571
She officially has a thing
for this bartender.

1:21:02.654 --> 1:21:05.449
No, I don't!
He just makes good piña coladas.

1:21:05.532 --> 1:21:08.535
And he's funny and smart and cute.

1:21:08.619 --> 1:21:10.287
Yeah, that's a start.

1:21:10.370 --> 1:21:12.539
- Okay, I'll see you guys down there.
- Bye.

1:21:50.410 --> 1:21:52.329
<i>Happy honeymoon, Jenn.</i>

1:21:53.330 --> 1:21:57.167
<i>Hopefully, this video
puts a smile on your face.</i>

1:21:58.168 --> 1:21:59.837
<i>I just wanted to say one more time...</i>

1:22:01.380 --> 1:22:02.422
<i>thank you.</i>

1:22:02.506 --> 1:22:04.842
<i>Thank you for saving my life.</i>

1:22:04.925 --> 1:22:07.511
<i>Thank you for seeing me so clearly, and...</i>

1:22:09.596 --> 1:22:11.682
<i>I wish we had more time together.</i>

1:22:13.600 --> 1:22:15.435
<i>But we made the best...</i>

1:22:16.812 --> 1:22:18.897
<i>that we could with what we had.</i>

1:22:20.858 --> 1:22:23.068
<i>And that was more than enough.</i>

1:22:23.151 --> 1:22:28.156
<i>So, when you think of me,
don't think of me as sick.</i>

1:22:28.240 --> 1:22:29.825
<i>Think of me like this.</i>

1:22:46.216 --> 1:22:48.677
<i>Go ahead. Open the box.</i>

1:22:54.349 --> 1:22:59.563

1:23:01.732 --> 1:23:04.234

- <i>Hey, baby, have you seen my coat?</i>

1:23:04.318 --> 1:23:05.319
<i>Uh...</i>

1:23:09.198 --> 1:23:10.532
<i>What do you think?</i>

1:23:10.616 --> 1:23:12.910
<i>Wow. It's a choice.</i>

1:23:12.993 --> 1:23:16.788
<i>Let me process that information.
I have to walk the dog.</i>

1:23:16.872 --> 1:23:18.373
- <i>Wait, what are you...</i>
- <i>Okay.</i>

1:23:22.294 --> 1:23:25.005
<i>Okay. Okay, go. Go, go...</i>

1:23:25.088 --> 1:23:26.381
<i>I love you!</i>

1:23:31.762 --> 1:23:33.096
<i>I actually like it.</i>

1:23:45.817 --> 1:23:47.152
<i>I love you.</i>

1:23:49.571 --> 1:23:50.989
I love you.

1:24:11.093 --> 1:24:13.470
<i>I wish we had more time together,</i>

1:24:13.554 --> 1:24:16.723
<i>but I am so grateful for the time we had.</i>

1:24:17.599 --> 1:24:20.894
<i>Because of Sol, I'm living for today.</i>

1:24:22.104 --> 1:24:23.605
<i>Living for now.</i>

1:24:25.232 --> 1:24:27.818
<i>And I know what it means to love.</i>

1:24:28.694 --> 1:24:30.279
<i>And be loved.</i>

1:24:30.362 --> 1:24:33.115
<i>To truly feel loved.</i>

1:24:35.242 --> 1:24:38.036
<i>I'll let the moments in my life guide me.</i>

1:24:38.120 --> 1:24:41.373
<i>And heal me. And strengthen me.</i>

1:24:41.456 --> 1:24:43.041
<i>And inspire me.</i>

1:24:44.334 --> 1:24:46.086
