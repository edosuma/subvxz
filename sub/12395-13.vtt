00:21.520 --> 00:23.488
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU'VE MET
JIMMY BRIGHAM.

00:23.520 --> 00:25.488
HE'S PRESIDENT
OF ADP SECURITY.

00:25.520 --> 00:27.181
- OH.

00:27.220 --> 00:28.414
- WELL, IT'S AN HONOR
TO FINALLY MET THE MAN

00:34.530 --> 00:36.066
TO SHEPHERDING THE MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS

00:36.100 --> 00:37.362
THAT FLOW THROUGH
THIS CHARITY.

00:37.400 --> 00:39.834
- ANY CHANCE I CAN HIRE YOU AWAY
TO BE MY CFO?

00:39.870 --> 00:41.189
- HEY, HEY...

00:41.240 --> 00:42.468
BECAUSE OF DEACON'S HARD WORK,

00:42.510 --> 00:43.636
CRIME IS DOWN 70%.

00:43.670 --> 00:45.501
COME, I'LL SHOW YOU

00:45.540 --> 00:47.701
- OKAY.

WHAT'S UP?

00:58.820 --> 01:00.378

01:00.420 --> 01:02.251
WE CHANGED ALL OUR SCHEDULES

01:02.290 --> 01:04.121
AND HE STILL BLEW US OFF.
- SUCKER.

01:04.160 --> 01:06.253

FROM THE LAST TIME HE CAME
TO TOWN AND GOT KIDNAPPED.

01:11.600 --> 01:13.534
- WELL, I'M REALLY HONORED
THAT YOU GUYS WOULD CHOOSE

01:13.570 --> 01:14.832
TO COME PERFORM
FOR US TONIGHT.

01:14.870 --> 01:16.428
- NO, WE'RE THE ONES
THAT ARE HONORED.

01:16.470 --> 01:18.404
- YOU'RE IN BLACKAPELLA?

01:18.440 --> 01:20.271
- WE ALL KNOW THAT EVERY
GREAT R&B BAND

01:20.310 --> 01:21.436
NEEDS A TOKEN WHITE PERSON.
- WHAT?

01:21.480 --> 01:24.278

FERGIE, DEBARGE HAD DEBARGE,

AND THERE'S THAT
HASSIDIC RAPPER...

01:27.420 --> 01:28.569
MATISYAH U.

01:28.620 --> 01:29.712

01:29.750 --> 01:30.842
- YEAH, BUT IT'S STILL WEIRD,

01:30.890 --> 01:32.357
DON'T YOU THINK, GUS?

01:32.390 --> 01:33.550
BY THE WAY,
WE'RE NOT CALLED BLACKAPELLA.

01:33.590 --> 01:35.683
WE'RE CALLED QUARTER BLACK NOW.

01:35.720 --> 01:37.449
- WE ARE?

01:37.490 --> 01:39.697
- UH--UH...I ALSO NOTICED
YOU GOT IT WRONG IN THE PROGRAM.

01:39.730 --> 01:42.267
- OKAY, SHAWN, REMEMBER WE'RE
HERE TO HONOR DEACON JONES,

01:42.300 --> 01:43.824
NOT WORRY ABOUT OUR CREDITS
IN THE PROGRAM,

01:43.870 --> 01:45.497
OR A NAME THAT STILL
DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

01:45.530 --> 01:46.861
- IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE.

01:46.900 --> 01:48.162
- THERE'S THREE OF US
AND ONE OF YOU.

01:48.200 --> 01:49.462
IF ANYTHING, WE SHOULD BE CALL--
- GUS!

01:49.510 --> 01:51.432
YOU'RE EMBARRASSING YOURSELF
IN FRONT OF THE GROUP.

01:51.470 --> 01:54.576

DO ANYTHING FOR YOU.

01:54.610 --> 01:56.248
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,
THIS MAN RIGHT HERE,

01:56.280 --> 01:57.349
HE SAVED OUR LIVES.

01:57.380 --> 01:58.699

TOLD ME

01:58.750 --> 01:59.717
HOW THEY WERE HEADING
FOR THE GANG LIFE AS KIDS,

01:59.750 --> 02:00.739
AND HOW YOU RESCUED THEM.

02:00.780 --> 02:03.886
- THESE TWO GUYS ARE
MY PROUDEST ACHIEVEMENTS.

02:03.920 --> 02:05.217
- EXCUSE ME, DEACON,
WE'RE ABOUT TO START.

02:05.250 --> 02:06.410
- UH, THIS IS TINA.

02:06.460 --> 02:07.654
SHE HANDLES ALL OUR FINANCES.

02:07.690 --> 02:09.157

02:18.500 --> 02:19.865
WAS THAT A |\(lIgMPLIMENT?

02:19.900 --> 02:21.492

I WAS HELPING OUT

02:21.540 --> 02:22.939
AT THE RIGHT NOW BOOT CAMP.

02:22.970 --> 02:24.460
- THERE'S A CAMP
JUST FOR BOOTS?

02:24.510 --> 02:25.909
- IT'S WHERE THEY TEACH KIDS
WILDERNESS STUFF

02:25.940 --> 02:27.578
AND THE VALUE OF TEAMWORK.

02:27.610 --> 02:29.202

YOUR INTRODUCTION, DEACON.

02:29.250 --> 02:30.740
AND THEN YOU THREE

ALL RIGHT, GIVE IT TO ME
STRAIGHT, HOW BAD IS IT?

04:27.030 --> 04:28.520
- OH, GOD.

- AM I GONNA DIE?
- YES.

04:30.630 --> 04:32.393
SOMEDAY.
BUT NOT FROM THIS.

04:32.440 --> 04:34.761
- STILL, I'VE LOST
A VITAL ORGAN.

04:34.800 --> 04:37.303
ONE THAT'S ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL
FOR HUMAN SURVIVAL.

04:37.340 --> 04:40.070
GUS, I ASSUME YOU'RE PREPARED
TO GIVE ME YOURS.

04:40.110 --> 04:42.305
- UH, NO.
- SO I CAN JUMP HIGHER.

04:42.350 --> 04:43.749
- WHAT? THAT MAKES
NO SENSE, SHAWN.

04:43.780 --> 04:45.805
BESIDES, YOU DON'T NEED
YOUR APPENDIX.

04:45.850 --> 04:47.818
IN FACT, MEDICAL SCIENCE
IS HAVING TROUBLE DECIDING

04:47.850 --> 04:49.078
IF THE APPENDIX IS ANY USE
TO THE BODY AT ALL.

04:49.120 --> 04:50.883
- THE DOCTOR SAID ALL YOU NEED
IS A FEW DAYS HERE

04:50.920 --> 04:52.558
TO RECOVER FROM SURGERY.

04:52.590 --> 04:54.410
- SO YOU'RE TELLING ME
THAT MY INSURANCE

04:54.460 --> 04:55.484
WON'T COVER THE TRANSPLANT.

04:55.520 --> 04:57.579
YOU GUYS ARE TRYING
TO PROTECT ME FROM THE FACT

04:57.630 --> 04:58.881
THAT I'M GONNA SPEND
THE REST OF MY LIFE

04:58.930 --> 05:02.991
IN A GIGANTIC PLASTIC BUBBLE...
JUST LIKE THE MOVIE I'M WRITING.

05:03.030 --> 05:04.759
- THEY'VE ALREADY MADE
TWO BUBBLE MOVIES, SHAWN.

05:04.800 --> 05:07.030
- YEAH, BUT MINE'S GONNA STAR
JAKE GYLLENHAAL.

05:07.070 --> 05:09.607
- YOU DON'T NEED
A TRANSPLANT, SHAWN.

05:09.640 --> 05:11.369
- BUT IT IS TRUE YOUR INSURANCE
WOULD NOT COVER YOUR SURGERY,

05:11.410 --> 05:13.628
MAINLY BECAUSE
YOU DON'T HAVE INSURANCE.

05:13.680 --> 05:15.773
- WHICH MEANS I'M FOOTING
THE BILL FOR ALL OF THIS.

05:15.810 --> 05:18.643
_ THANKS, POP. AND YOU KNOW,
I DON'T WANT TO IMPOSE,

05:18.680 --> 05:19.840
BUT I WOULD PREFER
A PRIVATE ROOM

05:19.880 --> 05:21.518
WITH AN OCEAN VIEW,
AND SATELLITE TV

05:21.550 --> 05:22.881
WITH MLB EXTRA INNINGS.

05:22.920 --> 05:24.046
- KEEP WISHING,
I MIGHT RIP YOUR HEART OUT.

05:24.090 --> 05:26.046
THAT'S AN ORGAN
YOU DO NEED.

05:26.090 --> 05:28.012
- UH, THAT'S A MUSCLE.
- WHATEVER.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.058
- LASSIE!

05:31.090 --> 05:33.399
THANKS FOR DROPPING BY,
BUT AS IT TURNS OUT,

05:33.430 --> 05:34.624
I'M PROBABLY GONNA BE OKAY.

05:34.660 --> 05:35.991
- I DIDN'T COME HERE
TO SEE YOU, SPENCER.

05:36.030 --> 05:37.520
AFTER YOU LEFI'
THE COMMUNITY CENTER,

05:37.570 --> 05:38.719
THERE WAS A SHOOTING.
- WHAT?

05:38.770 --> 05:42.399
- WHO GOT SHOT?

05:42.440 --> 05:44.965

* WHY DANCE AROUND
TO THE SAME DAMN SONG? *

06:47.000 --> 06:48.763

WENT STRAIGHT THROUGH

06:48.800 --> 06:49.698
AND MISSED HITI'ING
ANY VITAL ORGANS,

06:49.740 --> 06:51.059
BUT HE'S LOST A LOT OF BLOOD.

06:51.110 --> 06:52.600
THESE NEXT TWO DAYS
ARE GONNA BE CRUCIAL.

06:52.640 --> 06:54.039
- THANK YOU, DOCTOR.

YOU'RE MY MAN!

06:56.680 --> 06:58.671

07:01.950 --> 07:03.144
- OKAY.

07:03.190 --> 07:04.748
- ANY IDEAS
ON DEACON'S SHOOTER?

07:04.790 --> 07:07.054
- NO. ALL WE KNOW IS THAT
HE WENT BACK TO THE GREEN ROOM

07:07.090 --> 07:08.978
AFTER THE FUNDRAISER,
AND A SINGLE SHOT WAS FIRED.

07:09.020 --> 07:11.682
AT THIS POINT, OUR ONLY LEAD IS
A WITNESS WHO SAW A BLACK SUV

07:11.730 --> 07:12.856
SPEEDING AWAY
FROM THE SCENE.

07:15.830 --> 07:17.866
- ARE YOU SENSYIESE SOMETHING?

07:17.900 --> 07:21.893
MY PILLOWS ARE LUMPY.
WILL YOU GIVE THEM A FLOOF?

07:21.940 --> 07:24.158

FINDING HIS SHOOTER

07:25.610 --> 07:27.532

ON YOU LATER.

I'LL BE BACK ON MY FEET
IN NO TIME.

07:39.520 --> 07:42.683
WAIT A MINUTE, CAN I--

07:42.730 --> 07:44.254
CAN I WALK WITHOUT AN APPENDIX?
- YEAH.

07:44.290 --> 07:45.985
- WE SHOULD PLAY THIS SAFE.

07:46.030 --> 07:47.554

- YEAH?

07:47.600 --> 07:50.728
- I WANT A MOTORIZED RASCAL
WITH A SIDECAR FOR GUS.

PULLS THROUGH.

THAN TO HELP BUST
THIS LOWLIFE.

- ALL RIGHT.
- BUT. . .MY INCAPACITATION

08:08.720 --> 08:13.180
MEANS THAT MY PSYCHIC POWERS
ARE DOWN TEMPORARILY, FELLAS.

08:13.220 --> 08:15.688
I'M AFRAID GUS AND I ARE GONNA
HAVE TO SIT THIS ONE OUT.

08:15.720 --> 08:19.178
THIS CASE IS GONNA HAVE
TO GO UNSOLVED.

SHAWN IS RIGHT.

08:21.130 --> 08:23.189

ON THE SIDELINES FOR THIS ONE.

08:30.570 --> 08:31.662
AND GRAB A BITE TO EAT.

A RAINBOW POPSICLE
RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

LATER ON WE'RE GONNA GO

08:40.080 --> 08:41.945
TO THE A&W.
- [chuckles]

08:43.990 --> 08:45.048
WE NEED YOU ON THIS CASE,
GEE WHIZ.

08:45.090 --> 08:46.717
- DEACON MEANS THE WORLD
TO US.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.955
- YOU KNOW YOU HELPING US
INVESTIGATE WHO SHOT HIM.

08:48.990 --> 08:52.084
- I KNOW.

08:52.130 --> 08:53.825
- YOU DO KNOW THAT GUS
AND THOSE GUYS ARE GONNA

08:53.860 --> 08:55.225
GO INVESTIGATE THIS CASE
WITHOUT YOU.

08:55.260 --> 08:57.899
- MAN, I KNOW.

08:59.970 --> 09:01.562
- THE TIME CODE IS 4:15.

09:01.600 --> 09:03.033
THERE'S DEACON JONES
LEAVING THE STAGE

09:03.070 --> 09:04.332
AND ENTERING THE GREEN ROOM.

09:04.370 --> 09:05.928
- ALL RIGHT, WE KNOW
HE WAS SHOT IN THE GREEN ROOM,

09:05.970 --> 09:07.198
BUT THERE AREN'T
ANY CAMERAS IN THERE,

09:07.240 --> 09:08.832
SO WE DON'T HAVE A LOT
TO GO ON.

09:08.880 --> 09:11.041
- THERE ARE TONS OF POTENTIALS
ON THE SUV

09:11.080 --> 09:12.342
FLEEING THE COMMUNITY CENTER.

09:12.380 --> 09:14.746
- UGH, IT'S GONNA TAKE
QUITE SOME TIME FOR US

09:14.780 --> 09:17.248
TO NARROW DOWN WHICH ONE OF
THESE WE CAN PUT AT THE SCENE.

09:17.290 --> 09:19.656
WELL, YOU GUYS
KEEP ME POSTED.

09:19.690 --> 09:21.885
- MCNAB, CALL YOUR WIFE.

09:21.920 --> 09:22.989
TELL HER YOU WON'T
BE HOME FOR DINNER.

09:23.030 --> 09:25.055
- OH, SHE'S ACTUALLY
VISITING HER SISTER IN SPOKANE.

09:25.090 --> 09:27.251
EVERY YEAR
THEY KNIT A THROW FOR GRANNY--

09:27.300 --> 09:29.598
- A THROW FOR GRANNY?
I'VE GOTTA KNOW.

09:29.630 --> 09:32.019
WILL THERE BE A HIBISCUS
IN THIS DESIGN?

09:32.070 --> 09:35.961
- THERE WOULD BE,
IF THIS WERE 2004.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.264
THIS GUY!

09:38.310 --> 09:40.301
- LASSIE, JULES,

09:40.340 --> 09:42.171
WE'RE HERE TO HELP.
- LET'S DO IT.

09:42.210 --> 09:44.201
- HERE'S WHAT I NEED YOU TO DO.
GET BACK INTO YOUR CAR,

09:44.250 --> 09:45.945
MAKE LIKE A BAT OUT OF HELL
FOR THE OCEAN,

09:45.980 --> 09:48.278
AND THEN DRIVE
STRAIGHT INTO IT.

09:48.320 --> 09:50.709
OKAY, O'HARA, SQUARE ONE.

09:50.750 --> 09:52.615
WHO WOULD WANT DEACON JONES
OUT OF THE WAY?

09:52.660 --> 09:54.878
- WELL, FOR STARTERS,
THE GANG LEADERS,

09:54.920 --> 09:56.979
WHOSE YOUNG SOLDIERS HE'S BEEN
TAKING OFF THE STREETS.

09:57.030 --> 09:58.281
- RIGHT, THE ONLY PROBLEM
IS IDENTIFYING

09:58.330 --> 10:00.321
WHICH GANG HAS
THE BIGGEST GRUDGE AGAINST HIM.

10:00.360 --> 10:02.089
THERE'S THREE OPERATING
OUT OF THAT AREA OF THE CITY.

10:02.130 --> 10:04.223
- WELL, THE GANG THAT'S LOST
THE MOST KIDS TO DEACON

10:04.270 --> 10:05.669
IS THE ONE THAT'S BEEN AROUND
SINCE OUR DAY.

10:05.700 --> 10:06.667
THEY'RE CALLED
"THE ROLLING ONES."

10:06.700 --> 10:09.806
- THE GANG UNIT SAID
HE WAS RECENTLY HARASSED

10:09.840 --> 10:11.808
BY THE ROLLING ONES.
- EXCELLENT WORK O'HARA.

10:11.840 --> 10:14.206
- THAT'S WHAT I JUST SAID.

10:14.240 --> 10:15.707
- OKAY, THAT IS THE GROUP
WE WILL TARGET FIRST.

10:15.740 --> 10:17.742
WHO'S THEIR LEADER?
- HER NAME IS LIL SIS.

10:17.780 --> 10:19.748
- "LIL SIS"?

10:19.780 --> 10:22.374
WHAT HAPPENED TO REAL NICKNAMES
LIKE MAD DOG AND EL DIABLO?

10:22.420 --> 10:24.888
LIL SIS SOUNDS LIKE A CHARACTER
IN FAMILY CIRCUS.

10:24.920 --> 10:26.046
- SHE'S NO JOKE.

10:26.090 --> 10:27.717
SHE'S DOING FIVE YEARS
FOR ARMED ROBBERY.

10:27.760 --> 10:29.648
RUMOR IS SHE'S STILL
CALLING THE SHOTS.

10:29.690 --> 10:30.759
- YEAH, AND GOOD LUCK
GETI'ING HER

10:30.790 --> 10:31.882
TO GIVE UP ANYTHING.

10:31.930 --> 10:33.056
THE ROLLING ONES
PRIDE THEMSELVES

10:33.100 --> 10:34.727
ON NEVER TALKING
TO THE POLICE.

10:34.760 --> 10:36.250
- THERE MIGHT BE A WAY
TO GET HER TO TALK.

10:36.300 --> 10:39.269
- GUSTER, IT IS BAD ENOUGH
THAT I'M FORCED

10:39.300 --> 10:40.938
TO WORK WITH SPENCER
WEEK AFI'ER WEEK.

10:40.970 --> 10:44.269
BUT I AM SURE AS HECK NOT GONNA
DISCUSS POLICE STRATEGY

10:44.310 --> 10:46.437
WITH YOU AND THE PIPS!

10:46.470 --> 10:48.074
- LOOK, LOOK, LOOK.

10:48.110 --> 10:49.748
YOU NEED OUR HELP, OKAY?

10:49.780 --> 10:51.941
WE KNOW EXACTLY WHO WOULD AND
WOULDN'T HAVE BEEF WITH DEACON

10:51.980 --> 10:54.073
BECAUSE WE GREW UP
IN THIS COMMUNITY.

10:54.120 --> 10:55.747
- PLUS, LIL SIS
IS IN THE SAME UNIT

10:55.780 --> 10:57.281
AS YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

10:57.320 --> 10:58.844
IF MARLOWE COULD SOMEHOW
GET CLOSE TO HER,

10:58.890 --> 11:00.915
SHE MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET US
THE INFORMATION WE NEED.

11:00.960 --> 11:03.155
AND THAT KIND OF COOPERATION
COULD HELP EARN YOUR LADY

11:03.190 --> 11:04.680
AN EARLY PAROLE.

11:04.730 --> 11:06.322
- ON THE OTHER HAND,
MAYBE YOU AND THE O'JAYS

11:06.360 --> 11:09.966
ARE ONTO SOMETHING.

11:13.800 --> 11:16.098
GOD MUST HAVE INVENTED ORANGE
JUST TO SEE HOW BEAUTIFUL

11:16.140 --> 11:19.109
YOU LOOK IN THAT JUMPSUIT.

11:19.140 --> 11:21.700
- I WANT TO CURL UP
IN YOUR CHEST HAIR

11:21.740 --> 11:22.707
AND TAKE A NAP.
[whistle blows]

11:22.750 --> 11:25.071
- NO TOUCHING!

11:26.850 --> 11:29.717
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY'RE
LETTING US MEET FACE TO FACE.

11:29.750 --> 11:32.139
- THE WARDEN KNOWS YOU'RE
HELPING US OUT WITH THE CASE.

11:34.990 --> 11:37.026
WHAT?
- JUST THINKING ABOUT

11:37.060 --> 11:39.221
HOW LUCKY I AM
TO HAVE A BOYFRIEND

11:39.260 --> 11:41.125
THAT'S STILL COMMITTED
TO OUR RELATIONSHIP

11:41.160 --> 11:43.424
AND WORKING ON GETTING ME
AN EARLY RELEASE.

11:43.470 --> 11:46.098
- MARLOWE, I WOULD MOVE
HEAVEN AND EARTH TO BE WITH YOU.

11:46.130 --> 11:47.893
JUST AS LONG AS SAID MOVEMENT
IS IN ACCORDANCE

11:47.940 --> 11:49.066
WITH THE STATE LAWS
OF CALIFORNIA.

11:49.100 --> 11:51.500
- OH.

11:51.540 --> 11:53.098
I'VE BEEN HAVING
SOME TROUBLE

11:53.140 --> 11:55.779
GETTING CLOSE
TO LIL SIS.

11:55.810 --> 11:58.472
SHE AND HER CREW
REALLY STICK TO THEMSELVES.

11:58.510 --> 12:01.775
BUT I FIGURED OUT A WAY
THAT MIGHT HELP ME

12:01.820 --> 12:02.889
TO WIN SOME FAVOR
WITH THEM.

12:02.920 --> 12:04.046
- GREAT. WHAT?

12:05.420 --> 12:07.456
- [sighs]
IT'S A LITTLE UNCONVENTIONAL.

12:07.490 --> 12:10.220
- HEY, WHATEVER IT TAKES.
LAY IT ON ME.

12:10.260 --> 12:13.229
- JUST REMEMBER,
THIS IS FOR US. OKAY?

12:16.260 --> 12:17.761
_ AAA--

12:17.800 --> 12:20.360
[whistle blowing]

12:20.400 --> 12:23.904
- AAH! GET YOUR HANDS
OFF ME, SCREWS!

12:23.940 --> 12:28.309
AAH! NO! NO!

12:28.340 --> 12:31.946
AAH...UNH...AAH!

12:35.520 --> 12:37.488
[buzzer blares]

12:41.920 --> 12:43.922
HI, LOVER.

12:43.960 --> 12:45.086
IS IT BROKEN?

12:45.130 --> 12:47.223
- OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT,
SWEET PEA.

12:47.260 --> 12:49.820
IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME.
PROBABLY WON'T BE THE LAST.

12:49.870 --> 12:51.963
SO HOW'D IT GO
WITH LIL SIS?

12:52.000 --> 12:58.462
- UM...WE HAD A VERY
INTERESTING CONVERSATION.

12:58.510 --> 13:00.432
OH, HI, GUS.
- HELLO, MARLOWE.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.368
- DON'T TALK TO THEM.
- THIS IS MY FRIEND TONY.

13:02.410 --> 13:04.275
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

13:04.310 --> 13:05.948
- AND DRAKE.
- HOW YOU DOING?

13:05.980 --> 13:07.379
DAMN, JAIL GIRL,
YOU'RE FINE.

13:07.420 --> 13:10.514
- YOU WATCH YOUR MOUTH,
BARRY WHITE.

13:10.550 --> 13:12.984
THAT'S MY LADY.

13:13.020 --> 13:14.157
- AW, COME ON,
I MEAN, AT SOME POINT

13:14.190 --> 13:16.055
HE'S GOTTA RUN OUT OF BLACK
ARTIST REFERENCES, RIGHT?

13:16.090 --> 13:18.388
- THERE'S A LOT OF 'EM.
- SO...

13:18.430 --> 13:20.955
WHAT DID LIL SIS TELL YOU?
- WELL...

13:21.000 --> 13:22.422
SHE DID SAY
SHE HEARD A RUMOR

13:22.460 --> 13:24.325
THAT SOMEONE WITHIN
DEACON'S ORGANIZATION

13:24.370 --> 13:26.224
WAS SKIMMING MONEY, BUT--
- THAT'S IT.

13:26.270 --> 13:28.488
THAT IS IT!

13:28.540 --> 13:31.100
DEACON MUST HAVE FIGURED OUT
WHO THE EMBEZZLER WAS,

13:31.140 --> 13:32.459
CONFRONTED THE GUILTY PARTY,

13:32.510 --> 13:34.375
AND THEY TRIED TO
TAKE HIM OUT OVER IT.

13:34.410 --> 13:36.537
- DID I DO GOOD, BABY?

13:36.580 --> 13:38.104
- OH, BABY, YOU DID SO GOOD

13:38.150 --> 13:39.503
I WANT TO CLIMB OVER
THIS PARTITION

13:39.550 --> 13:41.871
AND GIVE YOU THE BIGGEST KISS
YOU'VE EVER HAD,

13:41.920 --> 13:43.888
BUT ONE OR BOTH OF US
WOULD BE TASERED.

13:43.920 --> 13:45.217
- YEAH.

13:45.250 --> 13:48.083
- HOWEVER...

13:48.120 --> 13:49.109
- MMM...
- [chuckling]

13:49.160 --> 13:50.149
OVER HERE?

13:50.190 --> 13:51.327
- I'M NOT BUYING IT.

13:51.360 --> 13:52.998
- I CAN'T EVEN LOOK.

13:53.030 --> 13:55.521
YOU KNOW I HAVE HANG-UPS ABOUT
WHITE PEOPLE HAVING PRISON SEX.

13:55.560 --> 13:59.098
[cell phone ringing]

13:59.130 --> 14:02.497
- UM...THIS IS BURTON.

14:02.540 --> 14:04.303
- GUS, WHERE ARE YOU?

14:04.340 --> 14:05.534
- OH, HEY, SHAWN.

14:05.570 --> 14:07.174
YEAH, MAN, I'M JUST,
YOU KNOW,

14:07.210 --> 14:08.234
HERE AT THE OFFICE,

14:08.280 --> 14:09.941
CATCHING UP
ON SOME PAPERWORK.

14:09.980 --> 14:11.538
- [P.A. announcer]
LOCK SEVEN, DOOR CHECK.

14:11.580 --> 14:13.343
- ARE YOU IN A WOMEN'S PRISON?
[door buzzes]

14:13.380 --> 14:14.415
- UH...UH...

14:14.450 --> 14:17.180
- IS LASSITER TALKING
TO MARLOWE?

14:17.220 --> 14:20.087
DUDE, YOU'RE INVESTIGATING
THE CASE WITHOUT ME!

14:20.120 --> 14:21.610
- OKAY, FINE, FINE. YES.

14:21.660 --> 14:23.958
TONY, DRAKE, AND I ARE WORKING
WITH LASSIE AND JULES.

14:23.990 --> 14:26.288
BUT CHECK THIS OUT--
WE GOT A BREAK IN THE CASE.

14:26.330 --> 14:29.458
MARLOWE THINKS THAT SOMEONE IS
SKIMMING FROM DEACON'S CHARITY.

14:29.500 --> 14:31.923
- TINA, THAT ASIAN LORI PETTI.

14:31.970 --> 14:33.369
SHE HANDLES ALL
OF DEACON'S MONEY.

14:33.400 --> 14:34.389
TELL LASSIE.

14:34.440 --> 14:37.204
- [whispering]
LASSIE. LASSIE!

14:37.240 --> 14:39.060
- WHAT?
- SHAWN SAYS TINA'S THE ONE

14:39.110 --> 14:40.134
WHO HANDLES THE FUNDRAISING.

14:40.180 --> 14:41.272
WE SHOULD START WITH HER.

14:41.310 --> 14:42.129
- THAT'S A DECENT LEAD.

14:42.180 --> 14:43.477
I'LL HEAD OVER
TO THE COMMUNITY CENTER,

14:43.510 --> 14:44.909
SEE WHAT SHE KNOWS.

14:44.950 --> 14:47.373
MEANWHILE,
YOU, WIND, AND FIRE

14:47.420 --> 14:49.615
STAY OUT OF MY WAY.

14:49.650 --> 14:51.538
I GOTTA GO, SWEET PEA.

14:51.590 --> 14:55.082
- NO TOUCHING!

14:55.120 --> 14:58.521
- I LOVE YOUR HAIR.
- I LOVE YOU.

15:00.630 --> 15:02.359
- ONE THING I DIDN'T MENTION
TO LASSIE,

15:02.400 --> 15:04.027
BECAUSE IT'S MORE FUN
NOT TO TELL HIM STUFF--

15:04.070 --> 15:05.628
TINA SAID SHE'S BEEN
HELPING OUT LATELY

15:05.670 --> 15:07.433
AT THE RIGHT NOW BOOT CAMP.

15:07.470 --> 15:08.539
- RIGHT NOW BOOT CAMP.

15:08.570 --> 15:10.037
GOT IT.
WE'LL HEAD OVER THERE.

15:10.070 --> 15:11.560
- HEY, I KNOW A BACK WAY
WE CAN TAKE

15:11.610 --> 15:12.929
THAT'S EVEN FASTER.
- COOL.

15:12.980 --> 15:13.730
- YOU'RE NOT GOING
WITHOUT ME.

15:13.780 --> 15:15.475
IF YOU VALUE OUR FRIENDSHIP,
GUS,

15:15.510 --> 15:17.944
YOU WON'T MAKE ANOTHER MOVE
UNLESS I'M RIGHT THERE WITH YOU.

15:17.980 --> 15:20.972
- SHAWN, HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME
TO DO THAT?

15:21.980 --> 15:24.210
- DUDE, HOLD ME HIGHER.
I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING.

15:24.250 --> 15:27.287
- I CAN'T BELIEVE I LET YOU
TALK ME INTO THIS, SHAWN.

15:27.320 --> 15:28.548
- WELL, LOOK AT IT THIS WAY.

15:28.590 --> 15:30.126
I'M FINALLY GONNA
USE THIS THING

15:30.160 --> 15:32.549
FOR SOMETHING MORE THAN
PLAYING FRUIT NINJA.

15:34.760 --> 15:36.421
- STOP LOOKING AT YOURSELF.

15:36.460 --> 15:37.620
LOOK INTO THE CAMERA,
SHAWN.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.661
- I'M SORRY,
I CAN'T HELP IT.

15:39.700 --> 15:41.531
MY HAIR LOOKS EVEN THICKER
IN HD.

15:46.340 --> 15:48.979
- THERE SHE IS.
- OOH, YEAH.

15:55.750 --> 15:59.311
- WHY DO YOU THINK
SHE LOCKED THE DOOR?

15:59.350 --> 16:00.487
- MAYBE SHE'S UP TO SOMETHING

16:00.520 --> 16:02.056
SHE DOESN'T WANT
ANYONE TO SEE.

16:02.090 --> 16:03.682
- [whispering]
EXACTLY. WATCH ME.

16:03.730 --> 16:06.028
- OKAY. OKAY.

16:21.310 --> 16:25.440
[loud snap, safe door creaks]

16:25.480 --> 16:27.539
- LOOKS LIKE TINA'S THE ONE
WHO'S SKIMMING.

16:27.580 --> 16:30.014
- SHE'S PROBABLY THE ONE
WHO SHOT DEACON.

16:30.050 --> 16:31.187
[lock snaps shut]

16:56.680 --> 16:58.705
- FELLAS, I DON'T LIKE
HOW THIS IS LOOKING--

16:58.750 --> 17:01.218
US ALONE IN THE WOODS
TRACKING A WOULD-BE KILLER.

17:01.250 --> 17:02.319
THIS IS NOT AFRICAN-AMERICAN.

17:02.350 --> 17:03.783
- I WAS THINKING
THE SAME THING.

17:03.820 --> 17:05.242
YOU KNOW, BLACK GUYS
IN THE MOVIES

17:05.290 --> 17:06.643
NEVER MAKE IT OUT
OF THESE SITUATIONS ALIVE.

17:06.690 --> 17:08.487
- OH, DON'T BE RIDICULOUS,
DRAKE.

17:08.520 --> 17:10.579
LL COOL J HAS SURVIVED
MICHAEL MYERS,

17:10.630 --> 17:12.723
GREAT WHITE SHARKS,
AND QUEEN LATIFAH.

17:12.760 --> 17:14.523
- WAIT A MINUTE, HOLIDAY
WASN'T A HORROR MOVIE.

17:14.560 --> 17:16.198
- IT WASN'T?
- NO.

17:16.230 --> 17:17.720
- OH, MAN, I DIDN'T
GET THAT FLICK AT ALL.

17:17.770 --> 17:18.520
- WILL YOU TWO STOP IT!

17:18.570 --> 17:20.390
THE THREE OF US
ARE NOT GONNA DIE.

17:20.440 --> 17:21.589
- GUS IS RIGHT.

17:21.640 --> 17:23.130
[whispers]
ONLY ONE OF YOU IS.

17:23.170 --> 17:24.467
IT'LL PROBABLY BE DRAKE.

17:24.510 --> 17:27.206
- I KNOW.
- HEY, I HEARD THAT!

17:32.650 --> 17:33.810
- NOW WHAT?

17:33.850 --> 17:35.442
- 3 1/2 AGAINST ONE.

17:35.480 --> 17:39.086
WE TAKE HER BY SURPRISE.
- YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

17:39.120 --> 17:40.417
THE QUESTION IS,

17:40.460 --> 17:45.124
WHICH ONE OF US
GOES IN FIRST?

17:45.160 --> 17:49.358
- AAAAAAAAAHHH!

17:49.400 --> 17:51.561
- WHERE DID SHE GO?

17:51.600 --> 17:53.465
[trigger cocks]

17:53.500 --> 17:55.331
- PLEASE TELL ME THAT WAS DRAKE
CRACKING A WALNUT

17:55.370 --> 17:57.804
AND NOT THE SOUND
OF A LOADED GUN.

18:00.640 --> 18:02.107
- GOOD THING SHE DOESN'T HAVE
ENOUGH BULLETS IN THERE

18:02.140 --> 18:03.300
TO SHOOT ALL OF US.

18:03.350 --> 18:06.501
- THIS GUN HOLDS TEN ROUNDS.

18:06.550 --> 18:07.869
- WELL, LET'S HOPE
SHE SHOOTS GUS TEN TIMES.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.148
- WHAT?

18:09.180 --> 18:10.181
- [whispering]
TELL HER TO SHOOT ME.

18:10.220 --> 18:12.381
TELL HER TO SHOOT ME
ALL TEN TIMES.

18:12.420 --> 18:14.217
SHOOT ME, BITCH!

18:14.260 --> 18:15.284
- I'M HOLDING YOU, SHAWN,
REMEMBER?

18:15.320 --> 18:16.617
- OH, YEAH.

18:22.600 --> 18:24.488
- WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

18:24.530 --> 18:26.623
- TRYING TO FIND OUT
WHO SHOT DEACON.

18:26.670 --> 18:28.297
AND RIGHT NOW,
YOU'RE OUR PRIME SUSPECT.

18:28.340 --> 18:31.639
- TINA, WE KNOW YOU'VE BEEN
SKIMMING FROM DEACON'S CHARITY.

18:31.670 --> 18:32.739
- WE ALSO KNOW
DEACON FOUND OUT,

18:32.770 --> 18:34.579
AND TO KEEP HIM QUIET,
YOU SHOT HIM.

18:34.610 --> 18:37.170
- YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING,
GUY ON THE SCREEN

18:37.210 --> 18:38.404
I THINK I MET ONCE.

18:38.450 --> 18:39.599
- OH, REALLY?

18:39.650 --> 18:41.743
I KNOW I COULD BE RELIEVING
MYSELF IN THE BED RIGHT NOW,

18:41.780 --> 18:44.146
AND YOU WOULDN'T KNOW ANYTHING.
- EWW.

18:44.190 --> 18:46.579
- I ALSO KNOW THE ONLY OPTION
YOU HAVE

18:46.620 --> 18:48.918
IS TO TURN YOURSELF IN
TO THE SBPD.

18:48.960 --> 18:51.781
- OKAY, YOU JACKASSES
HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S HAPPENING.

18:51.830 --> 18:54.549
AND ANYWAY, I GOT REAL PROBLEMS
I GOTTA DEAL WITH.

18:54.600 --> 18:56.249
GET IN THE CLOSET.

18:56.300 --> 18:57.824
- AW, HELL, NO, YOU AIN'T GONNA
BE TALKING TO ME CRAZY, A'IGHT.

18:57.870 --> 19:00.566
WE DON'T STUFF OURSELVES
INTO ANY TINY SPACES, A'IGHT?

19:00.600 --> 19:02.659
THAT'S WHERE I DRAW THE LINE.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

19:02.700 --> 19:04.531
AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO SHOOT
THIS MAN WITH ALL TEN BULLETS

19:04.570 --> 19:06.265
IF YOU WANT US TO GO
IN SOME DAMN CLOSET.

19:06.310 --> 19:09.529
- ARE YOU CRAZY, DRAKE?
[motorcycle revs outside]

19:09.580 --> 19:11.502
- PLEASE TELL ME THAT WAS TONY
MAKING A MOTORBOAT SOUND.

19:11.550 --> 19:14.519
- THAT IS THE PROBLEM
I GOTTA DEAL WITH.

19:14.550 --> 19:16.711
AND IF HE FINDS YOU,
HE WILL KILL YOU.

19:16.750 --> 19:18.308
SO GET IN THE CLOSET!

19:18.350 --> 19:20.910
[indistinct chatter]

19:20.960 --> 19:24.259
- STABILIZE YOURSELF!
I'M GETTING NAUSEAS.

19:27.260 --> 19:28.454
- WHERE'S MY MONEY?

19:30.500 --> 19:32.593
- FIRST WE NEED TO TALK.

19:32.630 --> 19:34.439
- AIN'T NOTHIN'
TO TALK ABOUT.

19:34.470 --> 19:36.529
- I WANT TO KNOW WHY DEACON
WAS PAYING YOU OFF.

19:36.570 --> 19:38.435
- TINA, I NEED THAT MONEY FAST.

19:38.470 --> 19:39.698
- WHY, YOU GOING SOMEWHERE?

19:39.740 --> 19:41.571
- JUST SHUT UP
AND MIND YOUR DAMN BUSINESS!

19:41.610 --> 19:42.975
- I AIN'T SCARED OF YOU.

19:43.010 --> 19:45.547
- YOU WILL BE IF YOU DON'T
GIVE ME MY MONEY!

19:45.580 --> 19:47.548
- GUS, THIS DOESN'T SOUND GOOD.
CALL LASSIE AND JULES.

19:47.580 --> 19:49.946
- DAMN IT, I DON'T HAVE MY
PHONE...YOU CALL 'EM.

19:49.980 --> 19:51.709
- THE NURSE TOOK MY CELL AWAY.

19:51.750 --> 19:53.308
SOME BUNK ABOUT
THE SIGNAL INTERFERING

19:53.360 --> 19:54.418
WITH THE LADY'S
HEART MONITOR.

19:54.460 --> 19:56.485
- BUT THEY LET YOU BE
ON THE INTERNET ON FACETIME?

19:56.520 --> 19:58.420
- APPARENTLY,
IT'S A VERY FINE LINE.

19:58.460 --> 20:00.325
[Tina grunts, fighting sounds]
- THE BASTARD IS A'I'I'ACKING TINA!

20:00.360 --> 20:01.998
- WE HAVE TO SAVE HER!

20:02.030 --> 20:04.328
- iPAD SHAWN IS A LOT BRAVER
THAN REAL SHAWN.

20:04.370 --> 20:05.723
- NO, HE'S RIGHT.
TINA HAD OUR BACK.

20:05.770 --> 20:06.725
WE HAVE TO HAVE HERS.

20:06.770 --> 20:08.567
ON THREE.
- NOW!

20:08.600 --> 20:10.363
[all shouting]

20:10.410 --> 20:13.868
- WHAT'S HE PAYING YOU?
WHAT'S HE PAYING YOU? HUH?

20:13.910 --> 20:16.629
- SHE'S WHUPPIN' HIS ASS.
- WHAT'S HE PAYING YOU!

20:16.680 --> 20:17.999
- TINA. TINA,
YOU DON'T WANNA KILL HIM!

20:18.050 --> 20:20.769
- NO, NO, NO.
YOU DON'T WANNA KILL HIM!

20:20.820 --> 20:22.617
RELAX!
- COME ON, COME ON, COME ON.

20:22.650 --> 20:24.789
- WAIT. NO!

20:24.820 --> 20:26.788
WAIT. NO, DON'T STOP--

20:26.820 --> 20:27.912
STOP! NO!

20:27.960 --> 20:29.518
- WAIT--
- STOP IT!

20:29.560 --> 20:31.585
WHAT THE HELL DID YOU
DO THAT FOR?

20:31.630 --> 20:32.881
- IT WAS HIS IDEA.
[motorcycle drives away]

20:32.930 --> 20:35.023
- YOU'RE POINTING
AT THE LAMP.

20:35.060 --> 20:36.129
- HEY, AT LEAST
HE DIDN'T GET THE MONEY.

20:36.160 --> 20:38.993
- SO, WAIT, IT WASN'T YOU
SKIMMING, IT WAS DEACON?

20:39.030 --> 20:41.032
- WHEN DID YOU FIND OUT
WHAT HE WAS UP TO?

20:41.070 --> 20:42.799
- A FEW DAYS AGO.

20:42.840 --> 20:44.831
I FOUND SOME DISCREPANCIES
IN THE BOOKS,

20:44.870 --> 20:46.929
AND I WAS GONNA CONFRONT DEACON
AFTER THE FUNDRAISER,

20:46.970 --> 20:48.733
BUT HE GOT SHOT.

20:48.780 --> 20:50.771
SO I DUG DEEPER,
AND I FOUND OUT

20:50.810 --> 20:52.607
CHUY WAS THE ONE
HE WAS PAYING OFF.

20:52.650 --> 20:54.709
I ARRANGED TO MEET HIM HERE,
BUT THANKS TO YOU,

20:54.750 --> 20:56.274
I STILL DON'T KNOW
WHAT FOR.

20:56.320 --> 20:57.810
- AGAIN, HIS FAULT.

20:57.850 --> 20:59.340
- DON'T MAKE ME MUTE YOU,
SHAWN.

20:59.390 --> 21:01.278
- I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
DEACON'S A THIEF.

21:01.320 --> 21:03.652
- WHY WOULD HE DO
SUCH A THING?

21:03.690 --> 21:05.783
- YOU CAN ASK HIM THAT
YOURSELF.

21:15.800 --> 21:19.429
- TINA TOLD US ABOUT
THE MONEY SKIMMING, DEACON.

21:19.470 --> 21:20.471
- LOOK, LOOK, LOOK, LOOK.

21:20.510 --> 21:21.875
THERE IS NO WAY
IN THE WORLD

21:21.910 --> 21:23.901
THIS BEAUTIFUL,
INSPIRING HUMAN BEING

21:23.950 --> 21:25.042
STOLE FROM HIS OWN CHARITY.

21:25.080 --> 21:27.071
- THAT'S RIGHT.
THIS MAN SAVED MY LIFE.

21:27.110 --> 21:29.317
GO AHEAD, DEACON, TELL 'EM.
YOU'RE NO THIEF.

21:29.350 --> 21:32.046
- I'M SORRY, BUT IT'S TRUE.

21:32.090 --> 21:35.059
- I ALWAYS KNEW YOU WERE A RAT!
- YOU'RE GOING STRAIGHT TO HELL.

21:35.090 --> 21:37.820
- HEY, I DID IT TO SAVE LIVES.
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

21:37.860 --> 21:40.829
THE ONLY WAY CHUY WOULD LET
THESE YOUNG KIDS OUT OF THE GANG

21:40.860 --> 21:42.555
WAS IF I PAID HIM
TO DO IT.

21:42.600 --> 21:45.364
SO YES, I TOOK MONEY
FROM MY OWN CHARITY.

21:45.400 --> 21:47.368
AND TECH NICALLY,
IT'S AGAINST THE LAW.

21:47.400 --> 21:48.890
BUT I DID IT
TO SAVE THESE YOUNG KIDS.

21:48.940 --> 21:51.966
AND THAT'S WHY PEOPLE DONATED
MONEY IN THE FIRST PLACE.

21:52.010 --> 21:53.034
- I ALWAYS KNEW
YOU WERE A SAINT.

21:53.070 --> 21:54.105
- YOU'RE GOING STRAIGHT
TO HEAVEN.

21:54.140 --> 21:55.368
- I AIN'T GOING NOWHERE YET.

21:55.410 --> 21:57.503
I'M STILL ALIVE.

21:57.550 --> 21:59.575
TROUBLE IS THAT CHUY WANTED
MORE AND MORE MONEY,

21:59.610 --> 22:00.508
AND I HAD TO CUT HIM OFF.

22:00.550 --> 22:02.848
THAT'S WHY HE CAME DOWN
TO THE FUNDRAISER,

22:02.880 --> 22:04.711
TO THREATEN ME.

22:04.750 --> 22:06.115
SO WE WERE HAVING
AN ARGUMENT,

22:06.150 --> 22:08.914
AND THEN I GOT SHOT,
AND I BLACKED OUT.

22:08.960 --> 22:10.552
- LOOKS LIKE CHUY'S
OUR SHOOTER, FELLAS.

22:10.590 --> 22:13.058
- DAMN IT! WE HAD HIM,
AND WE LET HIM GET AWAY.

22:13.090 --> 22:13.988
- YEAH.

22:14.030 --> 22:15.827
- ANY IDEA WHERE WE CAN
FIND CHUY, DEACON?

22:15.860 --> 22:17.521
- RUMOR HAS IT THAT
HE HAS HIDEOUTS

22:17.570 --> 22:19.390
ALL OVER THE SOUTH SIDE,
BUT...

22:19.430 --> 22:22.593
- DON'T! STOP IT. NO!
STOP IT!

22:22.640 --> 22:25.108
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
I'M GETTING SOMETHING.

22:25.140 --> 22:28.371
I AM SENSING THAT CHUY
IS BIG INTO BODY ART. RIGHT?

22:28.410 --> 22:30.970
I CAN SEE ONE OF HIS TATTOOS,
STILL IN PROGRESS.

22:31.010 --> 22:34.070
I CAN'T BE SURE,
IT'S EITHER A BURMESE TIGER

22:34.120 --> 22:36.611
OR SANDRA BERNHARD
SITTING ON A SPARKLER.

22:36.650 --> 22:39.585
- YEAH, THAT MAKES SENSE.
WORD IS HE'S BEEN OPERATING

22:39.620 --> 22:42.555
OUT OF THIS TATTOO PARLOR
ON BLANCO STREET.

22:42.590 --> 22:44.421
THAT'S RIGHT NEAR
THE COMMUNITY CENTER.

22:44.460 --> 22:47.554
- BINGO. THIS IS IT, FELLAS.
THIS IS IT.

22:47.600 --> 22:50.694
NOW, GUS, THIS IS USUALLY
THE PART OF THE INVESTIGATION

22:50.730 --> 22:52.527
WHERE I LOOK AT YOU,
AND I SAY, "YO, GUS,

22:52.570 --> 22:54.834
YO, WE GOTTA GO CONFRONT
THE BAD GUYS, SON."

22:54.870 --> 22:56.895
AND YOU LOOK BACK AT ME,
AND YOU SAY, "NO, SHAWN.

22:56.940 --> 22:59.067
"NO, SHAWN, NO, I CAN'T GO
CONFRONT A BAD--

22:59.110 --> 23:00.429
WE GOTTA CALL THE COPS, KID."

23:00.480 --> 23:01.902
- I DO NOT TALK
LIKE THAT, SHAWN!

23:01.940 --> 23:03.646
I DON'T TALK LIKE THAT.

23:03.680 --> 23:07.070
- I'M TELLING YOU,
DO NOT CONFRONT THE BAD GUY.

23:07.110 --> 23:08.543
CALL LASSIE AND JULES.

23:08.580 --> 23:10.912
- GREAT IDEA, SHAWN.
WE GOT IT.

23:10.950 --> 23:12.645
WE'LL CALL 'EM ON THE WAY
BACK TO THE STATION.

23:12.690 --> 23:15.784
- ALL RIGHT.
DRIVE SAFE, FELLAS.

23:15.820 --> 23:18.948
LATER ON, WE'LL DO SIT-UPS
IN A CIRCLE.

23:23.100 --> 23:24.522
- IF WE TAKE THIS
TO THE COPS,

23:24.570 --> 23:25.867
THEY'LL HAVE TO LAUNCH
AN INVESTIGATION,

23:25.900 --> 23:27.731
AND DEACON WILL GET BUSTED
FOR MISUSE OF FUNDS.

23:27.770 --> 23:29.658
- WELL, THERE'S GOTTA BE A WAY
TO BRING DOWN CHUY

23:29.700 --> 23:31.668
WITHOUT DEACON GETTING
IN TROUBLE.

23:31.710 --> 23:33.029
- WE HAVE TO CONFRONT
THE BAD GUYS.

23:33.070 --> 23:34.708
- I KNOW.

23:43.990 --> 23:45.218
- WHAT'S THE PLAN,
GEE WHIZ?

23:45.250 --> 23:48.014
- SHH. SHH.

23:48.060 --> 23:50.881
THAT'S THE TATTOO PARLOR
RIGHT THERE.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.852
ONE OF US HAS TO
SNEAK AROUND THE BACK,

23:52.890 --> 23:55.199
GET A VISUAL OF CHUY...
- AND THEN WE KILL HIM.

23:55.230 --> 23:57.892
- TAKE A PICTURE OF HIM
GETTING INTO THE SUV

23:57.930 --> 24:00.069
THAT HOPEFULLY MATCHES THE ONE
THE POLICE ARE LOOKING FOR.

24:00.100 --> 24:02.568
THERE'S DEFINITELY
SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOU.

24:02.600 --> 24:04.136
- RIGHT.
SEE, WITH THE PHOTO,

24:04.170 --> 24:05.706
WE CAN TIE CHUY
TO THE SUV

24:05.740 --> 24:06.900
THAT WAS LAST SEEN
LEAVING THE CRIME SCENE.

24:06.940 --> 24:08.601
- RIGHT.

24:08.640 --> 24:10.471
AND THEN LASSIE AND JULES
WILL ARREST HIM

24:10.510 --> 24:12.501
WITHOUT EVER KNOWING THAT
DEACON DID ANYTHING ILLEGAL.

24:12.550 --> 24:14.575
- THE QUESTION IS, WHICH ONE
OF US SNEAKS BACK THERE

24:14.620 --> 24:15.769
AND TAKES THE PICTURE?

24:15.820 --> 24:18.687
YOU KNOW WHAT, I'LL STEP UP.
I VOTE TONY.

24:18.720 --> 24:19.687
- ME? OH, NO.
I'M A TERRIBLE SHOOTER.

24:19.720 --> 24:20.789
YOU THE SHUTTERBUG.

24:20.820 --> 24:22.082
- I'LL GO BACK
AND TAKE THE PICTURE.

24:22.120 --> 24:23.519
both: THAT WORKS TOO.

24:23.560 --> 24:25.881
LOOK, YOU GUYS JUST STAY HERE
OUT OF SIGHT.

24:25.930 --> 24:28.751
I'LL BE BACK IN A SECOND.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.665
- IF HE'S NOT BACK
IN FIVE MINUTES,

24:30.700 --> 24:31.826
WE'LL GO GET
THE BB GUNS.

24:31.870 --> 24:33.735
- YOU KNOW THAT'S RIGHT.
- OKAY.

24:51.620 --> 24:53.281
- IS TEN MINUTES ENOUGH?

24:53.320 --> 24:56.050
BETTER BE SAFE
AND MAKE IT 20.

25:08.640 --> 25:11.905
[tires screech, engine revs]

25:18.580 --> 25:20.275
WHAT--

25:30.860 --> 25:32.122
- I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS.
I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS!

25:32.160 --> 25:33.650
I TURNED AWAY FOR A SECOND.

25:33.700 --> 25:35.156
ONE SECOND!
AND WHEN I LOOKED UP,

25:35.200 --> 25:36.258
THEY WERE BEING KIDNAPPED.

25:36.300 --> 25:37.119
- TRY TO CALM DOWN.

25:37.160 --> 25:38.092
JUST TELL US EVERYTHING
YOU REMEMBER.

25:38.130 --> 25:40.064
WHAT THE CAR LOOKED LIKE,
WHO WAS DRIVING.

25:40.100 --> 25:42.261
- I DON'T KNOW.
IT WAS A DARK-COLORED SUV

25:42.300 --> 25:43.801
HEADING THAT WAY.

25:43.840 --> 25:45.660
AND THE NUMBER--
THE LICENSE PLATE NUMBER

25:45.710 --> 25:47.803
ENDED IN "2190."

25:47.840 --> 25:49.899
- SOUNDS LIKE THE SAME SUV
FROM THE DEACON SHOOTING.

25:49.940 --> 25:50.941
- WELL, LET'S GET GOING
ON IT.

25:50.980 --> 25:52.140
LET'S GET A CHOPPER
IN THE AIR

25:52.180 --> 25:53.306
AND SEARCH THE AREA
OR SOMETHING.

25:53.350 --> 25:55.773
- SINCE WHEN ARE YOU
IN CHARGE, GUSTER?

25:55.820 --> 25:58.880
I NEED A CHOPPER
TO SEARCH THE AREA.

25:58.920 --> 25:59.989
- I HAVE NO IDEA
HOW THIS HAPPENED.

26:00.020 --> 26:01.157
- WAIT,
DIDN'T THE SAME THING HAPPEN

26:01.190 --> 26:02.612
TO TONY AND DRAKE
LAST YEAR?

26:02.660 --> 26:04.821
- NO. THAT WAS TONY AND JOON.

26:06.960 --> 26:08.655
WHAT ARE ALL THOSE POLICE CARS
DOING THERE?

26:08.700 --> 26:10.861
- I CAN'T LOOK AT YOU, SHAWN.
I'M TOO ASHAMED.

26:10.900 --> 26:12.925
- DON'T YOU TURN YOUR FACE AW--

26:12.970 --> 26:14.995
DON'T YOU DARE
GO ELEPHANT MAN ON ME.

26:15.040 --> 26:16.860
- FINE!

26:16.900 --> 26:18.663
I GOT TONY AND DRAKE
KIDNAPPED, SHAWN.

26:18.710 --> 26:19.768
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
LIKE LAST TIME?

26:19.810 --> 26:21.835
- PRETTY MUCH.
- WE NEED TO FIND THEM

26:21.880 --> 26:22.904
BEFORE THEY GET HURT.

26:22.940 --> 26:24.168
THEY'RE NOT AS STRONG
AS I AM.

26:24.210 --> 26:25.177
- WELL, WHATEVER CHUY'S
GONNA DO,

26:25.210 --> 26:26.609
HE'S NOT GONNA WASTE HIS TIME.

26:26.650 --> 26:29.949
OH, THIS WAS ON YOUR CAR.
EXPIRED METER.

26:34.220 --> 26:36.359
- WE NEED TO GET INSIDE
CHUY'S HEADQUARTERS

26:36.390 --> 26:37.982
AND FIND SOME CLUES NOW.

26:38.030 --> 26:39.884
- LUCKILY, I'M WEARING
MY PROBABLE CAUSE

26:39.930 --> 26:40.919
DOOR-KICKING SHOES.

26:45.930 --> 26:47.022
- GOOD, BUDDY.

26:47.070 --> 26:51.029
NOW POINT ME
AT EVERYTHING YOU SEE.

26:51.070 --> 26:52.264
- ARE YOU GETTING
ANY READINGS, SHAWN?

26:52.310 --> 26:53.402
- IT'S ALL CLEAR.

26:53.440 --> 26:56.238
- THERE'S STILL A DISCONNECT
BETWEEN ME AND THE ROOM.

26:56.280 --> 26:58.202
I'M AFRAID I'M GONNA NEED
A CONDUIT.

26:58.250 --> 27:01.276
GUS, TOUCH LASSIE'S FACE
AND NECK.

27:01.320 --> 27:04.346
- WAIT...HEY--
- GOOD.

27:04.390 --> 27:05.812
NOW GIVE HIS NOSE
A GENTLE SQUEEZE.

27:05.850 --> 27:07.784
[trigger cocks]
- YOU WANNA MESS AROUND,

27:07.820 --> 27:09.685
OR DO YOU WANT TO FIND
YOUR FRIENDS?

27:09.720 --> 27:12.188
LET'S GO CHECK OUT THE FRONT.
- OKAY.

27:12.230 --> 27:14.425
- FINALLY.
NOW THAT THEY'RE GONE,

27:14.460 --> 27:16.997
HELP ME PIECE TOGETHER
ANY CLUES THAT WE FIND.

27:17.030 --> 27:19.089
- I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH HELP
I'M GONNA ACTUALLY BE, SHAWN.

27:19.130 --> 27:21.360
MY INSTINCTS HAVE BEEN
ALL WRONG.

27:21.400 --> 27:22.560
STARTING WITH ME
TAKING THIS CASE

27:22.600 --> 27:24.431
WHILE YOU WERE STUCK IN THE
HOSPITAL IN THE FIRST PLACE.

27:24.470 --> 27:26.028
AND THEN NOT GOING
TO THE POLICE.

27:26.070 --> 27:27.332
- LIKE I TOLD YOU TO.

27:27.370 --> 27:28.200
- I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
IT WOULDN'T END WELL.

27:28.240 --> 27:29.832
- POINT ME IN A DIFFERENT
DIRECTION

27:29.880 --> 27:32.144
AND SHOW ME SOME STUFF.

27:36.450 --> 27:37.371
OH, HOLD UP, HOLD UP.

27:37.420 --> 27:41.789
LET ME SEE THAT ARTICLE
ABOUT THE SHOOTINGS.

27:45.190 --> 27:46.748
DAMN.

27:46.790 --> 27:49.896
REMIND ME TO STAY AWAY
FROM JEFFERSON BOULEVARD, PBBBT.

27:49.930 --> 27:51.795
- JEFFERSON'S ROLLING ONES'
TERRITORY.

27:51.830 --> 27:53.161
THEY'RE CALLED
THE ROLLING ONES BECAUSE

27:53.200 --> 27:55.088
THEY CONTROL ALL DRUG
TRAFFICKING ALONG JEFFERSON,

27:55.140 --> 27:57.267
FROM BLOCK 100 TO 190.

27:57.300 --> 27:58.938
- WHOA, SAY THE LAST PART
AGAIN.

27:58.970 --> 28:01.279
BLOCKS 100...
- TO 190.

28:01.310 --> 28:03.744
- GUS, WHAT WERE THE PARTIAL
LICENSE PLATE NUMBERS

28:03.780 --> 28:05.338
FROM THE SUV THAT TOOK
TONY AND DRAKE?

28:05.380 --> 28:09.248
- 2190. 2190!

28:09.280 --> 28:11.214
AS IN BLOCKS 100 TO 190.

28:11.250 --> 28:13.138
- GUS, THAT'S IT.
I BET THE LICENSE PLATE IS

28:13.190 --> 28:16.159
1-0-0-2-1-9-0,

28:16.190 --> 28:18.158
WHICH STANDS FOR
100 TO 190.

28:18.190 --> 28:20.795
- IT'S A VANITY PLATE BRAGGING
ABOUT THEIR GANG TERRITORY.

28:20.830 --> 28:23.321
- WHAT?
- COME ON, SON...

28:23.360 --> 28:25.760
[making soft,
excited noises]

28:25.800 --> 28:27.392
- OUCH! YOU GOTTA STOP.
THAT HURTS.

28:27.430 --> 28:29.295
WE NEED TO GET LASSITER
AND JULES.

28:29.340 --> 28:31.308
WE FIND THAT SUV,
WE ALSO FIND TONY

28:31.340 --> 28:33.501
AND DRAKE, AND DEACON JONES'
SHOOTER TOO.

28:33.540 --> 28:34.905
- I'M ON IT.

28:46.390 --> 28:50.383
- LOOKS LIKE THE DMV
GAVE US THE RIGHT ADDRESS.

28:52.490 --> 28:53.821
- WHERE'S MY MONEY?

28:53.860 --> 28:56.055
I KNOW YOU'RE WORKING
WITH TINA!

28:56.100 --> 28:57.419
- WE DON'T HAVE IT.
- PLEASE DON'T SHOOT US.

28:57.460 --> 28:58.927
PLEASE. . .PLEASE DON'T!

28:58.970 --> 29:00.961
[Tony and Drake begging]

29:01.000 --> 29:02.160
- PLEASE.

29:02.200 --> 29:03.235
- WE DON'T KNOW WHERE
THE MONEY IS.

29:03.270 --> 29:05.204
- SBPD FREEZE!
- DROP YOUR WEAPON!

29:05.240 --> 29:09.836
- YES! YES!
OH, YES! OH...

29:12.150 --> 29:15.210
[overlapping shouting]

29:15.250 --> 29:16.945
- GUS, DON'T HIDE.
YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

29:16.980 --> 29:18.311
- THAT'S EASY FOR YOU
TO SAY, SHAWN.

29:18.350 --> 29:19.942
THOSE AREN'T iBULLETS
WHIZZING BY.

29:19.990 --> 29:22.914
- GUS, WOULD YOU BE A MAN!
BE A MAN!

29:22.960 --> 29:25.155
NURSE, I WOULD LIKE A LITTLE
MORE OF THAT JELL-O, PLEASE.

29:25.190 --> 29:28.159
[alarmed shouts]
- GET DOWN! GET DOWN!

29:31.470 --> 29:34.166
- CHUY, STOP!
[gunshot]

29:36.200 --> 29:39.101
GUS, DON'T LET HIM GET AWAY.

29:39.140 --> 29:40.107
- WHAT DO YOU EXPECT ME
TO DO, SHAWN?

29:40.140 --> 29:41.573
- I DON'T KNOW.

29:41.610 --> 29:43.771
[engine turns over]

30:04.270 --> 30:07.125
- WELL, WE DID A SWEEP OF CHUY'S
HEADQUARTERS AND RESIDENCE,

30:07.170 --> 30:08.990
AND UNFORTUNATELY,
NONE OF THE DOZEN GUNS

30:09.040 --> 30:10.530
WE RECOVERED AND THE SCENE
MATCH THE BALLISTICS

30:10.570 --> 30:11.935
OF THE ONE THAT SHOT
DEACON JONES.

30:11.970 --> 30:12.937
- THAT DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT.

30:12.970 --> 30:14.904
HE MUST HAVE ANOTHER
WEAPONS CACHE SOMEWHERE.

30:14.940 --> 30:16.407
- WELL, CHUY'S DEAD,
AND THE TWO GANGBANGERS

30:16.440 --> 30:18.476
WE ARRESTED AT THE SCENE
AREN'T TALKING.

30:18.510 --> 30:20.000
WHICH IS WHY WERE
HOPING YOU TWO

30:20.050 --> 30:22.018
COULD HELP SHED SOME LIGHT
ON THE SITUATION.

30:22.050 --> 30:23.039
- YEAH, SURE,
DETECTIVE LASSITER.

30:23.080 --> 30:24.047
WHATEVER YOU NEED.

30:24.090 --> 30:25.284
- CAN YOU THINK OF ANYTHING

30:25.320 --> 30:26.514
THAT CHUY MIGHT HAVE SAID

30:26.550 --> 30:28.154
THAT WOULD CONNECT HIM
TO THE DEACON SHOOTING?

30:28.190 --> 30:29.509
- WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

30:29.560 --> 30:31.152
LISTEN TO ME.

30:31.190 --> 30:33.021
IF THOSE OTHER TWO DUDES
AREN'T TALKING,

30:33.060 --> 30:35.449
THEN MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T
SAY ANYTHING EITHER.

30:35.500 --> 30:38.060
- WE'RE NOT SUSPECTS.
- YOU'RE THE VICTIMS.

30:38.100 --> 30:39.465
- REALLY?

30:39.500 --> 30:41.161
WELL, HOW DO WE KNOW THAT
YOU'RE NOT TELLING

30:41.200 --> 30:43.168
THOSE OTHER TWO DUDES
THAT THEY'RE THE VICTIMS,

30:43.200 --> 30:45.339
AND WE'RE THE SUSPECT S?

30:45.370 --> 30:47.429
- WELL, I THINK SHOOTING AT THEM
WITH A COLT .45

30:47.470 --> 30:48.903
MADE MY POSITION PRETTY CLEAR.

30:48.940 --> 30:50.999
- DRAKE, YOU'RE ACTING PARANOID,
ALL RIGHT?

30:51.050 --> 30:52.574
JUST COOPERATE.
- JUST COOPERATE?

30:52.610 --> 30:54.578
[scoffs]
HOW DO I KNOW

30:54.620 --> 30:55.917
THIS ISN'T THAT OLD
POLICE TRICK

30:55.950 --> 30:56.917
WHERE THEY SEPARATE US,

30:56.950 --> 30:58.918
TELL ME THAT YOU'RE
SELLING ME UP THE RIVER,

30:58.950 --> 31:02.386
JUST TO GET ME TO
THEN START SNITCHING ON YOU?

31:02.420 --> 31:04.888
- BECAUSE WE'RE NOT
SEPARATED, DUDE.

31:04.930 --> 31:08.354
- AND YOU DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING WRONG.

31:08.400 --> 31:11.198
- RIGHT. RIGHT.
YEAH, I'M JUST CHECKING.

31:11.230 --> 31:13.061
YOU KNOW,
I GOTTA MAKE SURE.

31:13.100 --> 31:14.897
JUST FYI...

31:14.940 --> 31:16.567
I'D BE WILLING
TO TESTIFY

31:16.600 --> 31:19.103
AGAINST, UH...

31:19.140 --> 31:21.335
YOU KNOW, IN EXCHANGE
FOR LESSER CHARGES, OF COURSE.

31:21.380 --> 31:22.506
- LESSER THAN WHAT?

31:22.540 --> 31:26.306
- TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION,
DETECTIVE,

31:26.350 --> 31:29.513
YES, WE HEARD CHUY TALKING
ABOUT THE SHOOTING.

31:29.550 --> 31:30.676
- YEAH.
- FINALLY, SOMETHING HELPFUL.

31:30.720 --> 31:32.517
- CHUY KNEW THAT THE COPS
WERE TRYING TO

31:32.550 --> 31:34.086
PIN DEACON'S SHOOTING
ON HIM.

31:34.120 --> 31:35.257
WE OVERHEARD HIM
TELLING HIS BOYS

31:35.290 --> 31:37.554
HE DIDN'T DO IT, THOUGH.
- WELL, OF COURSE HE'D SAY THAT.

31:37.590 --> 31:39.251
- YEAH, BUT THAT'S
WHAT I THOUGHT TOO.

31:39.290 --> 31:40.928
BUT THEN HE SAID HE WAS
GONNA PROVE HIS INNOCENCE.

31:40.960 --> 31:42.325
- HOW?
- I DON'T KNOW HOW.

31:42.360 --> 31:43.588
I'M JUST GLAD YOU GOT THERE
WHEN YOU DID

31:43.630 --> 31:44.665
BECAUSE I'M TELLING YOU,

31:44.700 --> 31:45.564
THESE DUDES WERE ABOUT
TO TORTURE US.

31:45.600 --> 31:47.158
CHUY WAS GONNA JUMP START
OUR NIPPLES

31:47.200 --> 31:48.531
WITH A CAR BATTERY.

31:48.570 --> 31:49.537
- WE'RE TALKING DARK AGES HERE,
OKAY?

31:49.570 --> 31:52.038
I MEAN, THE MAN
PULLED OUT KNIVES, A BLOW TORCH,

31:52.070 --> 31:54.038
PLIERS, BAN DAGES,

31:54.080 --> 31:56.139
AND SOME EVIL-LOOKING STUFF
IN A BOTTLE CALLED, UH--

31:56.180 --> 31:57.374
HELP ME!

31:57.410 --> 31:58.707
- IT WAS LIDOCAINE.
- LIDOCAINE!

31:58.750 --> 32:00.968
- WHOA, WAIT, WAIT.
LIDOCAINE?

32:01.020 --> 32:02.339
THAT'S A LOCAL AN ESTHETIC.

32:02.380 --> 32:03.642
SOMETHING YOU WOULD USE
WHEN YOU WERE PERFORMING

32:03.680 --> 32:06.387
AN OUTPATIENT SURGERY.

32:06.420 --> 32:09.617
- WE WERE ARGUING,
AND THEN I GOT SHOT.

32:09.660 --> 32:11.525
- LUCKILY, MOST OF THE BULLET
WENT STRAIGHT THROUGH

32:11.560 --> 32:13.323
AND MISSED HITTING
ANY VITAL ORGANS.

32:13.360 --> 32:15.590
- TELL ME WHY
HE'S PAYING YOU!

32:15.630 --> 32:18.519
- GUS! UH, GUYS,
I'M HAVING A PSYCHIC VISION.

32:18.570 --> 32:21.095
CHUY WASN'T GONNA USE
THAT STUFF ON TONY AND DRAKE.

32:21.140 --> 32:22.630
HE WAS GONNA USE THEM
ON HIMSELF.

32:22.670 --> 32:23.466
- FOR WHAT?

32:23.500 --> 32:25.730
- TO REMOVE A BULLET
FROM HIS ARM.

32:25.770 --> 32:27.101
- WHY NOT JUST GO
TO THE HOSPITAL?

32:27.140 --> 32:29.233
- BECAUSE HOSPITALS
ARE MANDATED TO REPORT

32:29.280 --> 32:30.429
ANY GUNSHOT WOUNDS
TO THE POLICE.

32:30.480 --> 32:32.175
GANGBANGERS AVOID 'EM
AT ALL COST.

32:32.210 --> 32:34.417
- LASSIE, WE NEED TO GET WOODY
TO LOOK FOR THAT BULLET

32:34.450 --> 32:36.748
IN CHUY'S ARM.

32:36.780 --> 32:38.418
- LET'S GET DOWN THERE.

32:38.450 --> 32:41.157
- GODSPEED.

32:41.190 --> 32:43.283
GET 'EM.

32:43.320 --> 32:46.255
- OKAY, SHAWN,
ARE YOU SEEING ALL THIS?

32:46.290 --> 32:48.997
- IT'S JUST LIKE I'M THERE
WITH YOU, WOODY, MY MAN.

32:49.030 --> 32:51.294
- AND ARE YOU SEEING THIS?
- AAH!

32:51.330 --> 32:53.264
- [chuckles]
YEAH, HE CAN SEE.

32:53.300 --> 32:55.689
SO...FIRST THE BAD NEWS.

32:55.740 --> 32:58.732
BASED ON MY ANALYSIS
OF CHUY RODRIGUEZ' REMAINS,

32:58.770 --> 33:00.704
HE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN THE PERSON
WHO SHOT DEACON JONES.

33:00.740 --> 33:02.776
- BUT DEACON IDENTIFIED CHUY
AS THE SHOOTER.

33:02.810 --> 33:04.698
- HE MAY HAVE THOUGHT
CHEWBACCA SHOT HIM,

33:04.750 --> 33:06.706
BUT SHAWN'S HUNCH WAS RIGHT.

33:06.750 --> 33:09.116
I PULLED THIS BULLET
OUT OF CHUY'S ARM.

33:09.150 --> 33:11.141
IT MATCHES A BULLET FRAGMENT

33:11.190 --> 33:12.509
THAT WAS TAKEN
FROM DEACON JONES' SHOULDER.

33:12.550 --> 33:14.051
- SO THE BULLET WENT
STRAIGHT THROUGH DEACON

33:14.090 --> 33:14.988
AND HIT CHUY.

33:15.020 --> 33:16.578
- AND CHUY KNEW THAT BULLET
WAS EVIDENCE

33:16.620 --> 33:18.326
THAT WOULD PROVE
HE DIDN'T SHOOT DEACON.

33:18.360 --> 33:20.453
- MAYBE WHOEVER SHOT
DEACON JONES KNEW THAT TOO.

33:20.490 --> 33:22.549
- SO THEY BLEW HIM UP
BEFORE POLICE COULD FIND HIM.

33:22.600 --> 33:24.067
- WHICH MEANS THE SHOOTER'S
STILL OUT THERE.

33:24.100 --> 33:25.465
- WHICH MEANS
WE'RE BACK TO SQUARE ONE.

33:25.500 --> 33:27.024
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO OVER
WHAT WE KNOW.

33:27.070 --> 33:29.288
ONE, DEACON WAS SHOT
IN THE GREEN ROOM

33:29.340 --> 33:30.534
WHILE ARGUING WITH CHUY.

33:30.570 --> 33:32.128
- TWO, THE ONLY PEOPLE
WHO HAD ACCESS

33:32.170 --> 33:33.660
TO THE BACKSTAGE AREA
WERE BLACKAPELLA--

33:33.710 --> 33:34.699
- QUARTER BLACK.
- BLACKAPELLA...

33:34.740 --> 33:35.707
- QUARTER BLACK!

33:35.740 --> 33:37.332
- BLACKAPELLA, DEACON JONES,

33:37.380 --> 33:39.075
AND JIMMY BRIGHAM,
THE HEAD OF SECURITY.

33:39.110 --> 33:42.273
- WE NEED TO INTERVIEW
BRIGHAM AGAIN.

33:42.320 --> 33:44.538
- WHOA, HOLD UP, HOLD UP,
HOLD UP.

33:44.590 --> 33:49.482
IN ADDITION TO BLACKAPELLA
AND BRIGHAM,

33:49.520 --> 33:53.081
TINA--TINA ALSO HAD
ACCESS BACKSTAGE.

33:53.130 --> 33:55.348
AND SHE WAS STILL THERE
AFTER WE LEFT FOR THE HOSPITAL.

33:55.400 --> 33:57.356
I AM HAVING A VERY STRONG
PSYCHIC VISION

33:57.400 --> 33:59.425
THAT SHE IS HIDING SOMETHING
FROM THE POLICE.

33:59.470 --> 34:00.494
- YOU'RE SURE ABOUT THIS?

34:00.530 --> 34:03.795
- YES. 100% SURE.

34:03.840 --> 34:06.058
- ALL RIGHT, WELL,
BASED ON YOUR HUNCH,

34:06.110 --> 34:07.509
WE HAVE TO QUESTION TINA AGAIN.

34:07.540 --> 34:09.235
- OKAY.
PLEASE BE CAREFUL.

34:09.280 --> 34:12.807
- I WILL.

34:17.420 --> 34:20.309
- NICE WORK.
- THANKS.

34:26.330 --> 34:27.729
- WHAT'S ALL THIS ABOUT,
JIMMY?

34:27.760 --> 34:29.193
- YOUR SECURITY MAN
HAS OVERH EARD

34:29.230 --> 34:30.322
EVERY BREAK IN THE CASE

34:30.360 --> 34:32.362
FROM HIS POST
OUTSIDE THE DOOR.

34:32.400 --> 34:33.594
YOU KNOW THE COPS
ARE ONTO YOU,

34:33.630 --> 34:35.359
SO YOU HAD TO ACT FAST.

34:35.400 --> 34:36.594
- THANK YOU FOR
THE BRILLIANT IDEA

34:36.640 --> 34:38.460
TO USE FACETIME
TO KEEP YOURSELF IN TOUCH

34:38.510 --> 34:40.330
WITH WHAT YOUR BUDDIES
WERE DOING.

34:40.370 --> 34:42.304
- IT WAS GUS.
HE INSISTED.

34:42.340 --> 34:44.740
- I WASN'T TRYING
TO KILL YOU, DEAC.

34:44.780 --> 34:47.271
I ONLY WANTED TO SCARE YOU
BY SHOOTING THROUGH THAT WINDOW.

34:47.310 --> 34:48.538
- WHY?

34:48.580 --> 34:51.117
- BECAUSE...YOU'RE BAD
FOR BUSINESS, DEACON.

34:51.150 --> 34:52.549
THE SAFER YOU MAKE
THE NEIGHBORHOOD

34:52.590 --> 34:54.182
FOR LOCAL STORE OWNERS,

34:54.220 --> 34:56.518
THE MORE CLIENTS JIMMY'S
SECURITY COMPANY LOST.

34:56.560 --> 34:59.757
- OH, JIMMY. JIMMY,
WE'RE ON THE SAME TEAM, MAN.

34:59.790 --> 35:01.758
- WE WERE WHEN I WAS MAKING
ENOUGH MONEY

35:01.800 --> 35:03.722
TO TAKE CARE OF MY FAMILY.

35:03.760 --> 35:05.421
BUT THEN THE ECONOMY
WENT BAD,

35:05.470 --> 35:07.620
AND MY BIGGEST CUSTOMERS STARTED
CANCELING THEIR ACCOUNTS.

35:07.670 --> 35:09.228
- SO YOU WANTED TO FRAME
THE GANGS

35:09.270 --> 35:11.158
FOR TAKING A SHOT
AT DEACON JONES,

35:11.210 --> 35:12.302
PILLAR OF THE COMMUNITY.

35:12.340 --> 35:14.308
THEN EVERYBODY STARTS
FEARING THE GANGS AGAIN, RIGHT?

35:14.340 --> 35:15.830
AND THEY ALL RUN BACK TO JIMMY
TO PROTECT 'EM,

35:15.880 --> 35:16.733
JUST LIKE THE GOOD OLD DAYS.

35:16.780 --> 35:18.907
- THAT IDIOT CHUY
MESSED EVERYTHING UP

35:18.950 --> 35:20.838
WHEN HE PUSHED YOU
INTO THE LINE OF FIRE.

35:20.880 --> 35:22.313
- YEAH, WELL,
HIS ASS TURNED INTO

35:22.350 --> 35:23.817
SOME SERIOUS COLLATERAL
DAMAGE.

35:23.850 --> 35:26.341
- THE ONLY CONSOLATION IS THAT
I PROBABLY SAVED LIVES

35:26.390 --> 35:29.188
BY TAKING HIS.

35:29.220 --> 35:31.484
I ONLY WISH I DIDN'T HAVE TO
TAKE YOURS AS WELL.

35:31.530 --> 35:34.795
BUT SHAWN'S GIVEN ME
NO CHOICE.

35:34.830 --> 35:37.298
- I'LL GIVE YOU CHOICES,
MAN!

35:37.330 --> 35:38.888
LOOK AROUND.
YOU'RE IN A HOSPITAL, JIMMY.

35:38.930 --> 35:41.569
THINK THIS THROUGH--YOU CAN'T
JUST BE SHOOTING DUDES.

35:48.880 --> 35:51.371
- SOME ORDERLY IS GONNA
GET IN BIG TROUBLE

35:51.410 --> 35:53.549
FOR ACCIDENTALLY GIVING YOU
TOO MUCH MORPHINE.

35:53.580 --> 35:55.946
- REALLY? IS IT PRINCE MARKIE
DEE FROM THE FAT BOYS?

35:55.980 --> 35:57.572
- HEY, JIMMY, COME ON.

35:59.850 --> 36:03.251
- LET'S HOPE SPENCER'S HUNCH
ABOUT TINA PAYS OFF.

36:03.290 --> 36:06.828
- SOMETHING ABOUT IT
ISN'T SITTING RIGHT WITH ME.

36:06.860 --> 36:08.259
DIDN'T IT SEEM ODD
TO YOU GUYS

36:08.300 --> 36:09.426
THAT SHAWN WAS SO SURE?

36:09.460 --> 36:11.428
- WHEN HAVE SPENCER'S HUNCHES
NOT SEEMED ODD?

36:11.470 --> 36:13.563
- WE JUST THOUGHT HE FELT
REALLY STRONGLY ABOUT THIS ONE.

36:13.600 --> 36:16.398
- NO, I KNOW SHAWN.

36:16.440 --> 36:17.532
THE STRONGER HE FEELS
ABOUT SOMETHING,

36:17.570 --> 36:18.502
THE SILLIER HE'LL ACT.

36:18.540 --> 36:21.304
HE'LL MAKE AN OBSCURE
ANALOGY ON ANYTHING.

36:21.340 --> 36:22.876
HE'LL SAY HE'S 200% SURE,

36:22.910 --> 36:24.502
KNOWING GOOD AND WELL
THAT I'LL CORRECT HIM,

36:24.550 --> 36:25.903
BECAUSE THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

36:25.950 --> 36:28.669
BUT THIS TIME HE SAID
HE WAS 100% SURE.

36:28.720 --> 36:30.244
IT'S TOO SIMPLE.

36:30.280 --> 36:32.840
PLUS, HE WOULD NEVER REFER
TO US AS BLACKAPELLA.

36:32.890 --> 36:34.881
- SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
YOU THINK HE GOT IT WRONG?

36:34.920 --> 36:37.559
- ALL I KNOW IS THAT MY GUT'S
TELLING ME SOMETHING'S OFF.

36:37.590 --> 36:39.581
- WHAT, SO NOW WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO FOLLOW YOU ON HUNCHES TOO?

36:39.630 --> 36:41.757
- NO, I'M ASKING YOU
TO TRUST ME.

36:47.330 --> 36:48.592
- [groggy speech]
COME ON, JIMMY,

36:48.640 --> 36:50.767
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
DO THIS, MAN, COME ON--

36:50.800 --> 36:55.430
THINK ABOUT THE COMMUNITY
AND THE KIDS AND THE...

36:55.480 --> 36:58.745
AND THE CATS THAT HANG OUT
BEHIND THE BUILDING

36:58.780 --> 37:01.578
WITH THE BABY CATS AND...
[coughs]

37:01.620 --> 37:04.919
- MAN, DEACON,
THAT'S SOME DEEP NOISE.

37:04.950 --> 37:07.510
- YEAH?
- YOU KNOW,

37:07.550 --> 37:10.678
IF YOU HAVE TO GET MURDERED,
WHICH WE DO...

37:10.720 --> 37:15.555
BUT, UH...THERE ARE
MUCH WORSE WAYS TO GO.

37:15.600 --> 37:17.921
- HEY, SHAWN, IF YOU DON'T
DO SOMETHING, MAN,

37:17.960 --> 37:19.723
WE'RE GONNA DIE.
[chuckles]

37:19.770 --> 37:21.897
- [shrilly]
MAN...

37:21.940 --> 37:24.636
DON'T YOU THINK I WOULD HAVE
DONE SOMETHING BY NOW

37:24.670 --> 37:26.035
IF I COULD, DEACON?

37:26.070 --> 37:28.436
- [laughs]

37:28.480 --> 37:31.779
- I'M ON A BANANA SLED,
JACK!

37:31.810 --> 37:34.779
COME ABOOOOOOARD!

37:34.820 --> 37:36.378
[both laughing]

37:36.420 --> 37:39.412
COME GET ON MY BANANA SLED.

37:39.450 --> 37:41.315
- [groggily]
BANANA SLED...

37:45.760 --> 37:47.489
- [loud groan]

37:47.530 --> 37:48.929
- OH, HEY...

37:50.560 --> 37:52.926
- YOU COULDA GOT
A SECOND JOB!

37:52.970 --> 37:54.699
_ AH--

38:05.110 --> 38:07.499
OH!

38:07.550 --> 38:10.371
WHOA!
THAT'LL DO IT.

38:10.420 --> 38:12.741
- GOOD NIGHT, SWEET JIMMY.
- [chuckles]

38:14.790 --> 38:16.519
- STAY ON THE GROUND,
BRIGHAM!

38:16.560 --> 38:17.788
I SAID STAY ON THE GROUND!

38:17.820 --> 38:20.084
- MORPHINE!
THE MORPHINE...

38:20.130 --> 38:22.849
DEACON, YOU GOTTA COME
BACK DOWN TO EARTH, BUDDY.

38:22.900 --> 38:25.698
OKAY? HEY, YOU OKAY?

38:25.730 --> 38:28.961
- YEAH. I'M ON A BANANA SLED
WITH YOU.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.332
- FEEL THE PEEL, BABY.
FEEL THE PEEL.

38:33.010 --> 38:34.875
- SHAWN!

38:34.910 --> 38:36.707
THANK GOD YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

38:36.740 --> 38:38.776
WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT BRIGHAM
WAS GONNA DO TO YOU TWO GUYS.

38:38.810 --> 38:40.004
- THANK GOD YOU GOT HERE
WHEN YOU DID.

38:40.050 --> 38:41.642
- IT'S ALL THANKS TO GUS.

38:41.680 --> 38:43.045
HE HAD A FEELING
SOMETHING WASN'T RIGHT,

38:43.080 --> 38:44.581
AND HE CONVINCED US
TO TRUST HIM.

38:44.620 --> 38:45.848
- WHAT?

38:45.890 --> 38:48.085
AND WHO WAS ALL DOWN
ON THEMSELVES EARLIER,

38:48.120 --> 38:50.611
NOT TRUSTING THEIR INSTINCTS?

38:50.660 --> 38:51.820
THANKS FOR SAVING ME, BRO.

38:51.860 --> 38:54.454
- MAN, THANKS FOR KEEPING HIM
AT BAY UNTIL WE GOT HERE.

38:54.500 --> 38:56.024
- AW, YOU DA MAN.
- NO, YOU DA MAN.

38:56.060 --> 38:57.652
[giggling, silly noises]

38:57.700 --> 38:59.759
- SON!
- STOP IT!

39:04.910 --> 39:07.003
- WHY DID THE MORPHINE
NOT AFFECT YOU?

39:07.040 --> 39:10.373
- UH, WELL, LUCKILY
MY DAD REFUSED TO PAY

39:10.410 --> 39:12.742
FOR ANY KIND OF PAIN MEDICATION
AFTER 24 HOURS.

39:12.780 --> 39:14.771
THAT'S JUST GLUCOSE.

39:14.820 --> 39:18.745
I GOTTA ADMIT, THOUGH, MAN,
I FEEL ODDLY EUPHORIC, HUH?

39:18.790 --> 39:20.087
STRANGELY EN ERGIZED.

39:20.120 --> 39:21.712
- THAT'S THE ADRENALINE RUSH
FROM HAVING

39:21.760 --> 39:22.784
A LIFE-OR-DEATH EXPERIENCE.

39:22.820 --> 39:23.752
IT FADES AWAY FAST.

39:23.790 --> 39:25.929
- YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW
MY PAIN THRESHOLD, MAN.

39:25.960 --> 39:27.086
- I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
IT'S PRETTY HIGH.

39:27.130 --> 39:29.394
IT'S UP THERE.
IT'S PRETTY--

39:29.430 --> 39:31.398
- [pained groan]
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?

39:31.430 --> 39:32.624
- OH, HERE COMES THE PAIN.

39:32.670 --> 39:34.661
- WHAT--
- OH, I'M GOING DOWN, GUS!

39:34.700 --> 39:36.429
- DON'T GET RIGOR MORTIS
ON ME, SHAWN.

39:36.470 --> 39:39.769
- I'M GOING DOWN!
OH....GOD!

39:39.810 --> 39:41.903
DON'T LOOK AT ME, JULES!

39:41.940 --> 39:43.908
[groaning in pain]

39:43.940 --> 39:47.046
- YOU GOT THIS?

39:47.080 --> 39:58.651
- HI, KITTY.
HEY, KITTY, KITTY.

39:58.690 --> 40:00.419
- MAN, I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU GUYS HAVE TO LEAVE ALREADY.

40:00.460 --> 40:01.893
YOU SURE YOU CAN'T HANG OUT
FOR A FEW MORE DAYS?

40:01.930 --> 40:04.592
- SORRY, SHAWN, BUT WE HAVE
BUSINESS TO HANDLE AT HOME.

40:04.630 --> 40:06.063
- THAT'S RIGHT, BUSINESS.
WE CAN'T JUST BE

40:06.100 --> 40:07.499
RUNNING AROUND SANTA BARBARA

40:07.530 --> 40:09.066
CHASING BAD GUYS
FOR WEEKS ON END.

40:09.100 --> 40:10.658
- I KNOW, RIGHT?
WHAT THAT LOOK LIKE?

40:10.700 --> 40:11.735
- I KNOW, WHAT DO WE
LOOK LIKE TO YOU,

40:11.770 --> 40:13.101
SOME KIND OF SIDEKICKS
OR SOMETHING?

40:13.140 --> 40:15.574
- THAT'S RIGHT.
[laughter]

40:15.610 --> 40:17.874
- [sighs]

40:20.480 --> 40:23.074
- UH, GUYS, WE DON'T HAVE
ANY MORE CASES FOR YOU.

40:23.120 --> 40:24.519
- [sighs]

40:24.550 --> 40:26.108
- YOU NEVER GIVE US ANYTHING.

40:26.150 --> 40:29.210
- HEY, AT LEAST WE GET TO SING
TOGETHER AGAIN BEFORE YOU GO.

40:29.260 --> 40:31.922
- HOW'S THAT? BLACKAPELLA ISN'T
SCHEDULED TO PERFORM AGAIN.

40:31.960 --> 40:33.484
- NO, THEY'RE NOT.

40:33.530 --> 40:36.693
BUT QUARTER BLACK IS.
[fingers snapping]

40:36.730 --> 40:38.891
- * WE'LL HAVE A LOVE LOCKDOWN

40:38.930 --> 40:40.818
* LOCKDOWN, BABY

40:40.870 --> 40:43.236
* A SUPERMAX AFFAIR
OF THE HEART *

40:43.270 --> 40:45.932
* WE'LL HAVE A LOVE LOCKDOWN

40:45.970 --> 40:48.063
* LOCKDOWN, BABY

40:48.110 --> 40:50.476
- THIS IS NICE.
THANK YOU.

40:50.510 --> 40:51.477
- OH, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO THANK ME.

40:51.510 --> 40:53.205
YOU EARNED THIS BY
HELPING OUT THE DEPARTMENT

40:53.250 --> 40:55.844
ON THE CASE.

40:55.880 --> 40:57.643
- NO TOUCHING!

40:57.680 --> 41:01.184
- THAT GUYS IS REALLY STARTING
TO PISS ME OFF.

41:01.220 --> 41:03.154
[singing indistinctly]

41:03.190 --> 41:06.125
[shouting, cheering]

41:08.600 --> 41:11.194
[whistle blowing]

41:11.230 --> 41:13.198
[cheers and applause]

41:19.540 --> 41:21.201
THIS WAS NICE.

41:21.240 --> 41:25.540
- DUTY CALLS.

41:25.580 --> 41:27.548
I WILL CUT YOU, DEBBIE!

41:30.020 --> 41:31.112
[whistle blowing]

41:34.720 --> 41:37.712
