00:05.786 --> 00:07.705
How does it work?

00:07.705 --> 00:10.906
Friendface works along the same
principle as a cold or a plague,

00:10.906 --> 00:14.586
but it's not disgusting germs that
Friendface spreads, it's friendship.

00:14.586 --> 00:18.866
Each Friendface page is like a petri
dish filled with friendship germs.

00:18.866 --> 00:21.906
When you stick your face into the
dish, you may come away with millions

00:21.906 --> 00:24.066
of people attached to your face!

00:24.066 --> 00:27.546
That's right, it's basically
a diseased face of friendship!

00:27.546 --> 00:30.786
Just sign up with Friendface,
by giving us all of your personal

00:30.786 --> 00:33.946
information, and we'll provide a
web page where you can meet new

00:33.946 --> 00:38.906
friends, catch up with old ones,
and maybe find that special someone.

00:38.906 --> 00:41.146
Don't think about germs now,
that analogy's over.

00:41.146 --> 00:45.386
Now it's just love and companionship,
and everything's fine.

00:45.386 --> 00:47.866
We own everything
you put on Friendface,

00:47.866 --> 00:49.906
it says so in the terms
and agreements, but don't worry,

00:49.906 --> 00:52.346
we won't use it to do anything bad,
we promise.

00:52.346 --> 00:56.026
Just think about love and
companionship and everything's fine.

00:56.026 --> 00:57.906
Friendface. Friendface.

00:57.906 --> 01:00.066
FriendFace.

01:02.000 --> 01:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:30.386 --> 01:33.786
Can you two not use my email address
any more please, I've got a new one.

01:33.786 --> 01:34.786
Right.

01:34.786 --> 01:37.586
Jennywenny@Friendface?

01:37.586 --> 01:38.986
Oh, no, you've not signed
up with Friendface have you?

01:38.986 --> 01:41.266
Yes, I have, actually.
Why not, it's great.

01:41.266 --> 01:44.146
I joined last night, and
I've already got 30 friends.

01:44.146 --> 01:47.466
Baaaaaaa!
Yes, let's all join Friendface

01:47.466 --> 01:50.506
and become part of the herd. Ha!
I don't think so.

01:50.506 --> 01:52.826
Why not?
They're terrific!

01:52.826 --> 01:56.146
You can catch up on old friends,
you can flirt with people.

01:56.146 --> 01:58.626
I think I've got better things
to do than to talk to friends

01:58.626 --> 02:01.386
and flirt with people, thank you.

02:01.386 --> 02:04.226
You can play Scrabble online with it.

02:04.226 --> 02:06.026
It's just another way of shoving

02:06.026 --> 02:08.545
advertising in your face, Jen.
Don't do it, you'll regret it.

02:08.545 --> 02:12.426
It might be a great way to meet
women. All the girls on 7 are on it.

02:12.426 --> 02:13.106
I'm in.

02:13.106 --> 02:14.346
What?

02:14.346 --> 02:15.506
I've joined.

02:15.506 --> 02:16.666
That was quick!

02:16.666 --> 02:20.066
It was what you said about Scrabble.
I'm in a game now.

02:20.066 --> 02:20.746
I'm in!

02:20.746 --> 02:21.466
What?

02:21.466 --> 02:21.946
I've joined!

02:21.946 --> 02:23.266
What about the advertising?

02:23.266 --> 02:26.426
Oh, advertising doesn't have any
effect on me, Jen.

02:26.426 --> 02:28.826
I tune it out. So, er, the girls on
7, Kimberley, she's on this?

02:28.826 --> 02:29.866
Uh huh.

02:29.866 --> 02:34.026
Ah, cool, look! They've got this
great game on their home page.

02:34.026 --> 02:36.666
You have to throw a little
can of cola into a giant mouth.

02:36.666 --> 02:38.306
That's brilliant.

02:38.306 --> 02:40.226
God, I'm so thirsty.

02:59.786 --> 03:02.906
Listen, I've got to have a
word with you, oh, hang on.

03:02.906 --> 03:05.066
Jen, you can change your
setting on Friendface

03:05.066 --> 03:06.826
so you don't have to have that
annoying bleep

03:06.826 --> 03:08.066
every time you get a message.

03:08.066 --> 03:10.026
Incoming message!

03:11.746 --> 03:13.426
Sorry, that's me.

03:13.426 --> 03:15.866
Yeah, I just have to tell
you about, oh, hang on.

03:15.866 --> 03:19.706
Yep, Jen, just open a chat window
and then we can all talk in it.

03:19.706 --> 03:20.626
How do I do that?

03:20.626 --> 03:22.826
You just press the speech
bubble in the left hand corner.

03:22.826 --> 03:25.146
Oh, yeah.

03:27.386 --> 03:29.746
Yes.

03:35.466 --> 03:38.146
Oh, yeah, but don't forget if...

03:39.746 --> 03:41.666
What are you like?

03:41.666 --> 03:42.826
If I might interject.

03:47.466 --> 03:48.346
Oh, Moss.

03:48.346 --> 03:50.066
That's hilarious.

03:50.066 --> 03:52.106
That was a classic Moss line.

03:56.186 --> 03:57.626
Yeah.

04:01.706 --> 04:04.346
I love this.

04:04.346 --> 04:06.306
I feel so social.

04:09.986 --> 04:12.226
All right Jen I'm going to go
home now, it's nearly half seven.

04:12.226 --> 04:15.706
I'm just answering all my Friendface
messages, they sort of piled up.

04:15.706 --> 04:19.226
So many people I don't care about
getting in touch, it's brilliant.

04:19.226 --> 04:20.666
Oh, there's another one,

04:20.666 --> 04:24.226
and I'm getting into online games,
you know, real brain teasers.

04:24.226 --> 04:28.066
And I'm filling out a form on how
much I love Cuke, have you tried it?

04:28.066 --> 04:31.986
Cuke, yeah,
I love Cuke, it's heaven in a can.

04:34.986 --> 04:39.226
Anyway I'm going to head, all right.
Jen, don't get too obsessed by that.

04:39.226 --> 04:41.266
No, I won't.
Bye, Moss.

04:46.426 --> 04:49.746
Oh,
someone's added me as their friend,

04:49.746 --> 04:52.546
I went to school with her,
I wonder how she's doing?

04:52.546 --> 04:54.906
Oh, not very well. That's good.

05:11.546 --> 05:13.866
Incoming message.

05:13.866 --> 05:15.426
Jesus Christ!

05:15.946 --> 05:18.186
I mean, Jesus Christ.

05:18.186 --> 05:22.226
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

05:22.226 --> 05:24.546
Excuse me, some of us are
trying to sleep round here.

05:24.546 --> 05:28.466
This woman that I went out with
once wants to meet up again.

05:28.466 --> 05:31.986
Oh, I thought I got rid of her, but
oh, no, she found me on Friendface.

05:31.986 --> 05:34.746
Now I'm going to have to
spend all afternoon

05:34.746 --> 05:36.666
trying to make up lies of how
to get rid of her again.

05:36.666 --> 05:39.066
Oh, I think that is very mean,

05:39.066 --> 05:41.106
if it were me I would
like to know the truth.

05:41.106 --> 05:42.626
That you wear
way too much makeup.

05:42.626 --> 05:44.626
I do not!

05:44.626 --> 05:48.586
That's a horrible
thing to say, how dare you.

05:48.586 --> 05:50.386
Not you Jen, this girl.

05:50.386 --> 05:52.186
Oh, does she?

05:52.186 --> 05:53.266
Big time.

05:53.266 --> 05:54.986
Did you sleep with her?

05:54.986 --> 05:57.146
No.

05:57.146 --> 06:00.026
It wasn't my fault,
I got really drunk to try and

06:00.026 --> 06:02.866
make the evening pass quicker,
and then by the end of it

06:02.866 --> 06:04.986
the makeup thing was actually
starting to work for me a bit.

06:04.986 --> 06:06.346
Oh, please.

06:06.346 --> 06:08.586
I'm not proud of it Jen,
it's not going on my CV,

06:08.586 --> 06:10.866
but every man has a story like this.

06:10.866 --> 06:12.666
This is not the first story
you've told me like this.

06:12.666 --> 06:15.026
Every man has a few stories
like this.

06:15.026 --> 06:16.866
Oh, no!

06:16.866 --> 06:19.146
She used to
slap it on with a trowel.

06:19.146 --> 06:23.626
God, why don't women have the
confidence to know that less is more.

06:23.626 --> 06:25.946
Then, when she started crying

06:25.946 --> 06:30.106
it all ran down her face, it
was like breaking up with The Joker.

06:30.106 --> 06:34.546
Hang on, she was,
she was that upset, she was crying?

06:34.546 --> 06:37.586
It sounds like you really
hurt this girl's feelings.

06:37.586 --> 06:41.346
The least you can do is tell the
truth, be a man for God's sake.

06:41.346 --> 06:43.466
Whoa, don't, hey, I am a man.

06:43.466 --> 06:46.026
I will tell her, I will email her.

06:46.026 --> 06:47.626
No, you have to tell
her face to face.

06:47.626 --> 06:49.066
The hell I do.

06:49.066 --> 06:51.946
This is a fragile young woman,
what if she reacts badly?

06:51.946 --> 06:54.066
That's exactly why
I'm doing it on email.

06:54.066 --> 06:57.066
No, you have to tell her the truth
and you have to do it face to face.

06:57.066 --> 06:58.786
Do I?

06:58.786 --> 07:01.426
My mum's on Friendface, my mum!

07:01.426 --> 07:04.546
It's opened up another channel
of communication with my mum.

07:04.546 --> 07:05.706
Isn't that good?

07:05.706 --> 07:10.186
No, it is not good. She's put
down her current mood as sensual.

07:10.186 --> 07:11.746
Ooh.

07:14.026 --> 07:15.746
Why didn't you just not
accept her as a friend?

07:15.746 --> 07:17.506
Are you an animal?

07:17.506 --> 07:19.786
I can't turn down a
friend request from my mum.

07:19.786 --> 07:21.466
Message for me.

07:21.466 --> 07:22.906
Oh.

07:25.066 --> 07:28.106
I am eating my apple, mum.

07:30.506 --> 07:33.506
She packed me an apple this morning
and it's the issue of the day.

07:33.506 --> 07:36.346
I have to go, I'm meeting an
old school friend for lunch.

07:36.346 --> 07:40.306
Isn't it great the way Friendface
brings people together?

07:47.106 --> 07:49.906
Nanny's chasing the dog around,
all the kids are screaming,

07:49.906 --> 07:52.346
absolute bedlam, and here's me

07:52.346 --> 07:54.706
going to a meeting with the major
shareholders.

07:54.706 --> 07:56.746
My life is an absolute nightmare.

07:56.746 --> 08:00.346
Yes, yes, mine too.

08:00.346 --> 08:02.786
So what about the other
girls, what are they doing?

08:02.786 --> 08:04.346
Elaine is head of marketing
at Dennis Publishing.

08:04.346 --> 08:05.866
OK.

08:05.866 --> 08:07.266
She's married to the
editor of Esquire.

08:07.266 --> 08:08.266
Is she?

08:08.266 --> 08:10.386
Veronica is in A&R with Arista,

08:10.386 --> 08:14.626
her big embarrassing story is she
passed on Arctic Monkeys.

08:14.626 --> 08:16.506
Idiot.

08:16.506 --> 08:19.826
Jilly is an architect,
designing a new wing on The Tate.

08:19.826 --> 08:22.506
Jilly, Jilly Spencer?

08:22.506 --> 08:25.626
She used to eat the wood on her desk.
I always thought she was slow.

08:25.626 --> 08:27.106
She's a genius.

08:27.106 --> 08:29.546
Wow, everybody's doing great.

08:29.546 --> 08:30.786
Yeah.

08:30.786 --> 08:33.226
So what about you, Jen?

08:33.226 --> 08:34.506
What are you up to?

08:34.506 --> 08:36.746
What am I up to?

08:36.746 --> 08:38.746
Yeah. Oh, god, I hope
that's not a rude question.

08:38.746 --> 08:39.826
No, no, no, no.

08:39.826 --> 08:44.066
It would be awful if I just listed
all our successful friends

08:44.066 --> 08:46.946
and you were stuck in some terrible,
dead end job you hated.

08:46.946 --> 08:49.906
Oh, god,
that would be an absolute fucker.

08:49.906 --> 08:54.946
No, no, I'm Head of IT
at Reynholm Industries.

08:54.946 --> 08:57.706
Oh, I didn't know you were
interested in computers.

08:57.706 --> 09:01.386
Interested is not the word.

09:02.386 --> 09:04.346
Sorry.

09:04.346 --> 09:06.506
Hi, babe.

09:08.906 --> 09:14.186
You didn't have to call
just to tell me that,

09:14.186 --> 09:16.746
no I can't,

09:16.746 --> 09:19.666
I'm in public. Stop it.

09:19.666 --> 09:21.426
Yeah, of course I'm wearing it.

09:25.626 --> 09:27.626
Can I have another one, please?

09:37.626 --> 09:39.386
Hi, Roy.

09:39.386 --> 09:40.826
Hi.

09:42.466 --> 09:45.706
Roy, do you have any

09:45.706 --> 09:49.426
attractive,
successful-looking friends?

09:49.426 --> 09:52.066
No.

09:52.066 --> 09:53.986
What, none at all?

09:53.986 --> 09:55.026
No.

09:57.466 --> 10:00.786
Oh, god, well maybe
you could help me then.

10:00.786 --> 10:03.946
Wow, that's flattering.
Are you pissed?

10:03.946 --> 10:07.506
A little bit. Could you come
to a school reunion with me

10:07.506 --> 10:09.026
and pretend you're my husband?

10:09.026 --> 10:11.986
Do you really think that you can
quiz me for a better option

10:11.986 --> 10:13.546
and think I'll still say yes?

10:13.546 --> 10:15.266
I'll give you Â£50.

10:15.266 --> 10:16.746
When is it?

10:16.746 --> 10:18.186
Tomorrow night.

10:18.186 --> 10:22.266
I sort of bigged myself up
to this girl, she never had much

10:22.266 --> 10:25.626
time for me at school and I wanted
to impress her so, I need a husband.

10:25.626 --> 10:29.506
Yeah, I can't because tomorrow
night I'm spending the evening

10:29.506 --> 10:33.066
with The Joker. Yeah,
I'm going to do what you said,

10:33.066 --> 10:35.106
I'm gonna tell her the truth, tell
her I'm just not interested in her.

10:35.106 --> 10:38.386
Ooh, you're not actually
going to do that face to face?

10:40.626 --> 10:42.186
You told me to.

10:42.186 --> 10:44.666
Well,
aren't you worried she'll go mad?

10:44.666 --> 10:48.346
I'm very worried about that.

10:48.346 --> 10:52.266
Oh, you are a...oh!
I'm going to cancel.

10:52.266 --> 10:54.226
No, no you can't cancel, not now.

10:57.026 --> 10:59.346
Who am I going to ask then?

10:59.346 --> 11:02.266
Who are you going to ask what?

11:02.266 --> 11:03.986
Nothing.

11:03.986 --> 11:06.666
The queen of honesty here needs
someone to pretend to be her husband

11:06.666 --> 11:08.146
at her school reunion.

11:09.946 --> 11:12.386
When is it?

11:21.306 --> 11:23.226
So, you remember what to do.

11:23.226 --> 11:24.626
Big you up to the max.

11:24.626 --> 11:25.266
By?

11:25.266 --> 11:27.106
Listing your fictional achievements.

11:27.106 --> 11:28.226
Uh huh, and?

11:28.226 --> 11:30.746
Saying how lucky I am
to have met you

11:30.746 --> 11:33.386
and talking about
our sweet sex life.

11:33.386 --> 11:36.426
Maybe not the last one, we
don't want to sound too smug.

11:36.426 --> 11:38.986
If I'm pretending
to be married,

11:38.986 --> 11:41.906
I'm pretending to be
sexually active.

11:41.906 --> 11:46.146
Don't worry Jen,
I plan on earning this Â£10.

11:46.146 --> 11:48.026
Five now, five later.

12:00.788 --> 12:02.348
Thank you.

12:04.508 --> 12:07.148
So...how are you?

12:07.148 --> 12:12.748
I'm fine. It was great seeing your
profile pop up on Friendface.

12:12.748 --> 12:15.508
Gave me a great excuse
to get back in touch.

12:15.508 --> 12:20.348
Yeah, that's the brilliant thing
about that bloody website.

12:20.348 --> 12:22.108
And how are you?

12:22.108 --> 12:24.668
I'm great, I am great, yeah.

12:24.668 --> 12:27.668
I'm glad that we got
together, Alison, because...

12:27.668 --> 12:31.708
it's only fair that I be completely
honest with you. The truth is...

12:31.708 --> 12:33.428
Do you mind if
I say something first?

12:33.428 --> 12:35.228
Er...OK.

12:35.228 --> 12:37.668
I've never been very
good with words, so...

12:37.668 --> 12:40.188
I wrote it down and
it turned into a poem.

12:40.188 --> 12:44.548
I'm sorry...
Are you going to read a poem now?

12:44.548 --> 12:46.748
Is that what's
actually going to happen?

12:46.748 --> 12:48.268
Yeah, is that all right?

12:48.268 --> 12:50.508
Wouldn't you prefer to text it to me?

12:50.508 --> 12:52.068
It's a bit long for that.

12:52.068 --> 12:54.748
Okey dokey.

12:54.748 --> 12:57.188
"Oh, gentle Irish eyes..."

12:57.188 --> 12:58.788
Oh!

12:58.788 --> 13:01.668
"tussled brown hair,

13:01.668 --> 13:05.148
"smile as big as
my favourite teddy bear."

13:05.148 --> 13:09.388
That's a bit corny, I might take
it out or I might leave it in.

13:09.388 --> 13:12.988
"Without you, I am just a husk."

13:12.988 --> 13:14.868
I, er... A husk?

13:14.868 --> 13:15.988
Yeah.

13:15.988 --> 13:17.868
Uh-huh!

13:17.868 --> 13:23.548
"Without you, I am just a husk,
a dead thing,

13:23.548 --> 13:30.508
"my new best friend is a razor,
a rope, a noose to swing...in." Oh!

13:30.508 --> 13:33.188
"Without you,
the sweet release of death

13:33.188 --> 13:36.148
"would be all that
could give me hope!

13:39.268 --> 13:42.748
"When I see your face
on my computer,

13:42.748 --> 13:45.788
"I don't just see you.

13:45.788 --> 13:48.268
"I see our future."

13:52.828 --> 13:55.268
Oh, it's...

13:55.268 --> 13:57.708
Oh-oh!

13:58.788 --> 14:01.228
Oh...mmm!

14:03.108 --> 14:06.668
Which is how my sexy wife
became the first ginger woman

14:06.668 --> 14:09.188
on the cover of Newsweek.

14:09.188 --> 14:10.548
That is wow.

14:10.548 --> 14:15.668
Just when I think I've heard every
story that puts Jen in a good light,
you come up with another one.

14:15.668 --> 14:19.308
Yes, and they're beginning to
sound a little bit unbelievable.

14:19.308 --> 14:20.908
Oh, I can't help it!

14:20.908 --> 14:24.788
I love this well-travelled high
earner. A woman in the living room,

14:24.788 --> 14:28.348
a chef in the kitchen,
a prostitute in the bedroom.

14:28.348 --> 14:30.108
Ow!

14:32.108 --> 14:36.148
Jen, why don't you tell them
all about your bionic arm?

14:38.588 --> 14:43.588
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I could do. Or, or
we could talk about something else.

14:43.588 --> 14:45.348
Yeah, we've heard
enough stories about Jen.

14:45.348 --> 14:46.628
< Yeah!

14:46.628 --> 14:48.748
We want to hear about
the guy that tamed her heart.

14:48.748 --> 14:50.868
Yeah, what do you do, Moss?

14:50.868 --> 14:52.988
I'm a professional tennis player.

14:57.188 --> 15:00.028
Yeah, he doesn't like
talking about it, though, so...

15:00.028 --> 15:01.068
I do.

15:01.068 --> 15:03.068
Where do you play?

15:03.068 --> 15:04.388
Where don't I play.

15:04.388 --> 15:05.148
Wimbledon?

15:05.148 --> 15:07.308
I don't play there.

15:07.308 --> 15:08.828
Are you seeded, Moss?

15:08.828 --> 15:10.988
Bit of a personal question, Terry.

15:10.988 --> 15:12.948
But...

15:12.948 --> 15:17.588
yes, I'm highly seeded, we have two
lovely children, Zenith and Quasar.

15:17.588 --> 15:20.708
I, I love, I love this song.

15:20.708 --> 15:24.428
Let's all stop talking
and dance to this song!

15:24.428 --> 15:26.788
POP MUSIC PLAYS

15:31.188 --> 15:34.588
Come on, let's dance.

15:38.748 --> 15:44.868
Her name is Jen,
er, she's a work colleague.

15:44.868 --> 15:48.788
We've been seeing each other
for some time.

15:48.788 --> 15:51.108
I love her, I love that woman.

15:51.108 --> 15:52.748
Do you have a picture of her?

15:52.748 --> 15:55.548
A picture of her? No.

15:55.548 --> 15:57.868
What, not even on your phone?

15:57.868 --> 16:00.948
No, it never occurred to me
to take a picture of her,

16:00.948 --> 16:02.588
because I see her all the time.

16:02.588 --> 16:05.108
You just don't want me!

16:05.108 --> 16:09.188
Oh, I do, I do, it's, it's...
Why wouldn't I want you?

16:09.188 --> 16:10.868
No, it's just, it's this girl.

16:10.868 --> 16:12.348
There is no girl.

16:12.348 --> 16:16.388
There is! It's a real girl.

16:16.388 --> 16:18.548
Look, could you...?
Could you just stop crying?

16:18.548 --> 16:21.188
No, I'm never gonna stop crying!

16:22.588 --> 16:25.108
Do you want to meet her?
We can meet her.

16:25.108 --> 16:26.108
What, really?

16:26.108 --> 16:29.188
Yeah, let's go and meet Jen.

16:29.188 --> 16:32.108
Will that make you
a little less mad?

16:37.268 --> 16:40.028
Tough, though,
the whole marriage thing.

16:40.028 --> 16:43.148
Terry, it's as tough
as a cow's back.

16:43.148 --> 16:45.228
You know what takes
the edge off for me?

16:45.228 --> 16:46.228
What?

16:46.228 --> 16:47.788
Regular, uninhibited,

16:47.788 --> 16:51.908
exploratory sex with a partner
who's even wilder than I am.

16:51.908 --> 16:55.148
That's Jen. She may look like
a ginger angel, but get her

16:55.148 --> 16:59.068
behind closed doors and she turns
into Peter Stringfellow.

16:59.068 --> 17:01.148
God, I envy you.

17:01.148 --> 17:04.788
These days, Delina hardly
ever lets me, you know, do it.

17:04.788 --> 17:08.028
Ah, I'm on Jen at least
four times a day.

17:08.028 --> 17:11.667
As I've already said,
I am fully seeded.

17:13.147 --> 17:15.387
You've got it really
sorted, haven't you?

17:15.387 --> 17:17.988
Yeah, it's very surprising,
isn't it?

17:17.988 --> 17:21.268
No offence, Jen, but I've got
to admit I always thought

17:21.268 --> 17:25.508
you'd be the one whose life just
went completely off the rails.

17:25.508 --> 17:29.308
You always seemed to attract such
chaos at school, but look at you now.

17:29.308 --> 17:31.868
Delina, can we be best friends?

17:33.028 --> 17:37.548
Tell you the truth, I think Delina
might be sleeping with someone else.

17:37.548 --> 17:40.228
No, she's just over there.

17:40.228 --> 17:41.548
I mean, this is just
between ourselves.

17:41.548 --> 17:43.108
Of course.

17:43.108 --> 17:48.068
Little clues here and there,
things only a husband would pick up.

17:48.068 --> 17:51.748
Like, someone wrote a message
on her Friendface wall read,

17:51.748 --> 17:55.148
"Can't wait to shag
your arse off again soon."

17:56.268 --> 17:59.268
I don't know, maybe
I'm reading too much into it.

17:59.268 --> 18:05.108
Still, if I ever found out who
that person was, "Ooh...god."

18:05.108 --> 18:07.508
Agh, it's a pickle, Terry.

18:07.508 --> 18:09.708
Women! Oh...

18:09.708 --> 18:13.588
If I had a pound for every
bloody woman...

18:13.588 --> 18:15.428
Argh...oh!

18:15.428 --> 18:17.948
I hear ya.

18:20.388 --> 18:21.708
Hi there, Jen!

18:21.708 --> 18:24.108
What are you doing here?

18:24.108 --> 18:27.708
I saw on your profile that
you were having a party.

18:27.708 --> 18:30.908
That's the great thing about
Friendface, I get to see

18:30.908 --> 18:33.868
what all my employees
are doing, all the time.

18:39.388 --> 18:41.228
Come on, be game.

18:46.668 --> 18:50.588
Ah, there she is!
There's Jen!

18:50.588 --> 18:54.188
OK, Jen, I am gonna help you out,
but need you to play along!

18:54.188 --> 18:54.668
This is Alison!

18:57.188 --> 19:00.628
She's the friend I told you
about, remember? And this...

19:00.628 --> 19:03.188
This is Jen,
the woman I love!

19:04.508 --> 19:05.668
What's going on here?

19:05.668 --> 19:07.428
What are you doing?

19:07.428 --> 19:09.828
I'm enjoying an evening
out with my woman.

19:10.988 --> 19:13.388
What?!

19:13.388 --> 19:16.028
Jen, who is this joker?!

19:16.028 --> 19:18.188
No offence!

19:19.868 --> 19:22.788
OK...what the hell is
going on here?

19:23.868 --> 19:26.908
Moss is my husband, Roy.

19:26.908 --> 19:30.028
But you said you wanted me.
..She really did!

19:31.748 --> 19:35.228
It's true, I did want you,
at one point.

19:35.228 --> 19:40.308
You were the one that I wanted,
but then you left, you left, Roy,

19:40.308 --> 19:44.348
and so I turned to Moss,
and Moss was there for me, Roy.

19:44.348 --> 19:48.668
Moss was there for me in a way
that you were not,

19:48.668 --> 19:52.428
and now we're together,
and that's all that matters.

19:54.268 --> 19:56.468
I don't know.

19:56.468 --> 19:58.188
What?

19:58.188 --> 19:59.628
I don't know, Jen.

20:01.188 --> 20:03.908
I love you, God knows I do.

20:03.908 --> 20:07.508
Your sweet abandon in bed,
your humanitarian work,

20:07.508 --> 20:11.268
you've given me two wonderful
children in Zenith and Quasar.

20:11.268 --> 20:15.148
But it sounds to me like you still
have feelings for this young man,

20:15.148 --> 20:18.228
and I'm not sure I can
handle that. I'm not sure at all!

20:18.228 --> 20:21.028
I don't. I don't.
I don't have feelings for this man.

20:21.028 --> 20:23.908
Yes, you do.

20:23.908 --> 20:25.828
Admit it, Jen!

20:25.828 --> 20:30.828
Admit that you have feelings for me,
loudly, here, in front of Alison.

20:30.828 --> 20:35.188
No, I don't.
He means nothing to me, Delina.

20:36.628 --> 20:40.388
Well, you moved on quickly,
you bitch!

20:47.268 --> 20:51.428
How dare you call
my sexy wife a bitch!

20:54.148 --> 20:55.948
Do you want to take this outside?

20:55.948 --> 20:57.628
With pleasure, sir.

20:57.628 --> 21:00.388
I will just get some of my coats.

21:01.988 --> 21:04.028
Excuse me, Alison.

21:06.868 --> 21:08.068
What now?

21:08.068 --> 21:10.068
Hadn't really thought this far.

21:24.788 --> 21:27.748
I'll just go and see how they are.

21:34.308 --> 21:37.068
Oh, those bloody bastards!

21:45.228 --> 21:48.068
Oh, lovely to see Jen!

21:49.708 --> 21:52.708
See her?
I'm shagging her.

21:52.708 --> 21:55.068
Grr!

22:01.948 --> 22:04.388
Well, hello there, beautiful.
