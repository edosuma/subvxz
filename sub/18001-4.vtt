00:07.816 --> 00:09.787
<i>You guys see the new
planet of the apes movie?</i>

00:09.821 --> 00:10.989
- Yeah.
- It's got to make you

00:11.023 --> 00:13.226
wonder though, right? Human beings are ripe

00:13.261 --> 00:16.332
to be taken over by any animal that garners

00:16.367 --> 00:18.638
its super-intelligence and speech.

00:18.672 --> 00:20.041
- Right?
- No.

00:20.076 --> 00:22.149
[Laughter] Are you telling me that like

00:22.184 --> 00:24.389
any number of rodents that if they told me

00:24.424 --> 00:26.193
what to do, I'm going to listen to them?

00:26.228 --> 00:28.200
[Laughter] I think I would just squash 'em.

00:28.235 --> 00:29.874
I think he's got you there.

00:29.908 --> 00:31.611
They'd have to be of
somewhat equal size, I think.

00:31.646 --> 00:35.354
I guarantee you even a
titmouse is on your shoulder...

00:35.389 --> 00:37.126
suddenly I'm like, "you're my boss.

00:37.160 --> 00:39.297
- What do you want me to do?"
- [Laughing]

00:39.331 --> 00:40.969
- I'm telling you man.
- I disagree

00:41.003 --> 00:42.576
because they need the opposable thumb.

00:42.610 --> 00:46.251
The only reason is
they can't open doors.

00:46.285 --> 00:48.493
That's the only reason we're
not being taken over right now.

00:48.527 --> 00:50.261
Probably. Well, no.

00:50.296 --> 00:51.763
Come on, man. I tape a speak & spell

00:51.797 --> 00:53.566
on the back of a turtle's shell,

00:53.601 --> 00:57.343
that turtle rules over him. [All laughing]

00:57.377 --> 00:59.981
I bow down to you master, I'm sorry.

01:00.015 --> 01:01.317
I'm sorry.

01:37.116 --> 01:39.689
Hello and welcome to another
episode of Comic Book Men,

01:39.723 --> 01:41.525
the only show the lives at the corner

01:41.561 --> 01:43.629
of sesame street and fury road.

01:43.664 --> 01:45.564
- I'm your host, Kevin Smith.
- Bryan Johnson.

01:45.598 --> 01:46.965
- Walt Flanagan.
- Mike Zapcic.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.101
Ming Chen.

01:48.135 --> 01:51.542
Fe-fi-fo-fum, tell
me tales of comic-Dom.

01:51.578 --> 01:54.080
We had a guy come in who was probably

01:54.115 --> 01:56.385
the biggest Indiana Jones fan ever.

01:56.419 --> 01:57.753
Oh.

02:03.797 --> 02:05.668
- Whoa.
- Gentlemen.

02:05.702 --> 02:08.138
Dr. Jones, no time for love.

02:08.173 --> 02:10.041
- [Laughter]
- Let me see what you got here.

02:10.074 --> 02:11.543
What's up, indy?

02:11.578 --> 02:12.779
Oh, nothing. I was
just in the neighborhood

02:12.813 --> 02:14.181
passing by and thought I'd drop in

02:14.215 --> 02:16.683
and see how y'all doing. How are you?

02:16.718 --> 02:17.984
Just in the neighborhood.

02:18.019 --> 02:20.185
Just happened to be in
your Indiana Jones costume.

02:20.220 --> 02:22.856
- [Laughter]
- Costume.

02:22.890 --> 02:25.226
<i>I happen to be a huge Indiana Jones fan.</i>

02:25.260 --> 02:26.893
Do the website, do a podcast,

02:26.927 --> 02:28.327
all about the man with
the whip and the hat.

02:28.362 --> 02:29.764
But I have some rare antiquities,

02:29.798 --> 02:31.167
just like Indiana Jones.

02:31.201 --> 02:34.302
I was hoping that you would
maybe parlay and help me out

02:34.336 --> 02:36.707
'cause I'm trying to score some money.

02:36.741 --> 02:38.076
All right, what you got?
You got "shankara" stones?

02:38.110 --> 02:39.144
You got the holy grail?

02:39.179 --> 02:40.646
Like, what are we talking about here?

02:40.681 --> 02:43.315
- You guys like eating lunch?
- I mean, clearly.

02:43.350 --> 02:45.086
[All laughing]

02:45.120 --> 02:49.090
Well, I just happen
to have a rare lunch box

02:49.124 --> 02:51.225
given to the crew that worked on

02:51.259 --> 02:54.495
<i>Indiana Jones and the
kingdom of the crystal skull.</i>

03:02.507 --> 03:04.208
Was that a consolation prize?

03:04.242 --> 03:06.344
"I'm sorry you worked
on such a crappy movie."

03:06.378 --> 03:07.945
Whoa.

03:07.979 --> 03:09.011
"Crappy"?

03:09.046 --> 03:10.346
Oh, come on, you liked that movie?

03:10.380 --> 03:13.816
I mean, come on, clearly
the man liked that movie.

03:13.850 --> 03:15.151
Right, I mean, the
first three were great.

03:15.186 --> 03:16.253
I would trust him for the first three.

03:16.287 --> 03:17.421
That fourth one come out,

03:17.455 --> 03:18.723
like, I'm putting the hat in storage.

03:18.757 --> 03:20.858
Not only that, I was
almost an extra in that movie.

03:20.892 --> 03:23.159
They filmed it in my hometown
in new haven, Connecticut,

03:23.193 --> 03:24.592
and I tried out to be an extra.

03:24.626 --> 03:27.161
- Did you show up like this?
- Yeah.

03:27.196 --> 03:29.064
Let's get the stalker off the set.

03:29.099 --> 03:31.599
[All laughing]

03:31.633 --> 03:33.334
You know, is this straddling a line

03:33.368 --> 03:34.798
between healthy and unhealthy

03:34.832 --> 03:36.934
when you walk around
dressed like Indiana Jones?

03:36.968 --> 03:38.767
Indiana Jones is easier to pull off

03:38.802 --> 03:41.605
than being dressed like if
Batman is your favorite hero,

03:41.639 --> 03:43.173
and you're walking around with a mask on.

03:43.207 --> 03:45.739
And then it's a little tougher
to negotiate the real world

03:45.773 --> 03:47.775
without people being
like, "did you see that?"

03:47.810 --> 03:50.143
But Indiana Jones, you
could always just be like,

03:50.178 --> 03:52.512
"oh, maybe he's from Panama.
He just dresses like that."

03:52.546 --> 03:54.447
[All laughing]

03:54.482 --> 03:55.848
So what do you think?

03:55.882 --> 03:57.249
Is that worth anything to you?

03:57.283 --> 04:00.284
I mean, I imagine this
has got to be pretty coveted

04:00.318 --> 04:02.052
<i>on indy... Indiana Jones Fandom.</i>

04:02.086 --> 04:04.186
<i>But, unless you're an Indiana Jones buff,</i>

04:04.220 --> 04:05.286
there's nothing to indicate

04:05.321 --> 04:06.620
<i>that this was from Indiana Jones.</i>

04:06.654 --> 04:10.589
All right, perhaps I
can interest you in this...

04:10.623 --> 04:12.491
<i>Prop from raiders of the lost ark.</i>

04:12.526 --> 04:14.860
The Chachapoyan fertility idol.

04:14.895 --> 04:16.795
All right, it's something
a little more recognizable.

04:24.740 --> 04:25.907
Wow, this is pretty cool though, huh?

04:25.941 --> 04:27.108
It's got some heft to it.

04:27.143 --> 04:28.876
But underneath, there's
something even special.

04:28.910 --> 04:30.645
Oh, is this Harrison Ford?

04:30.680 --> 04:32.748
Yes, I've compared it to the ones I own

04:32.782 --> 04:35.182
and that looks like the man's signature.

04:35.216 --> 04:36.683
Did you get that in person?

04:36.717 --> 04:37.851
Not that particular one.

04:37.885 --> 04:41.653
- Okay, so...
- Not authenticated.

04:41.688 --> 04:44.858
Just seeing that idol,
that's iconic in movies, man.

04:44.892 --> 04:47.593
Like, you don't necessarily
even have to know those movies

04:47.628 --> 04:49.395
<i>to be like, oh, that's from
raiders of the lost ark.</i>

04:49.429 --> 04:51.398
'Cause, you know, before
he faces the big Boulder,

04:51.433 --> 04:53.330
he's got the fertility God in his hand.

04:53.365 --> 04:55.230
It opens the entire franchise.

04:55.264 --> 04:58.501
- Instead of a lunch box.
- [All laughing]

04:58.536 --> 05:00.736
- Is it screen used?
- Yes, sir, it is.

05:00.770 --> 05:02.103
This was actually on camera?

05:02.137 --> 05:04.706
That's what I was told by
the person who sold it to me.

05:04.741 --> 05:06.773
I love it though. I mean, it looks cool.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.340
But what are you looking to get for it?

05:08.374 --> 05:11.908
What do you say... a grand?

05:11.942 --> 05:14.672
- $1,000?
- For something that might

05:14.706 --> 05:16.866
be signed and might be from the movie.

05:16.900 --> 05:19.297
And might be something he
didn't make in pottery class.

05:19.331 --> 05:21.399
[All laughing]

05:21.433 --> 05:24.231
I'm just worried that,
you know, that it's...

05:24.266 --> 05:26.833
- That it's fake.
- [All laughing]

05:29.403 --> 05:31.571
Would you do 900?

05:31.606 --> 05:33.638
Come on, how many times
is somebody going to walk

05:33.672 --> 05:35.206
through this door with a fertility idol

05:35.240 --> 05:36.440
signed by Harrison Ford?

05:36.474 --> 05:38.172
I just don't think I can go that high.

05:38.206 --> 05:41.373
I mean, although it pains
me to see it walk out of here

05:41.407 --> 05:43.210
'cause I would love to
put it on a shelf here.

05:43.244 --> 05:45.812
It does belong in a museum,
but I guess not yours, huh?

05:45.846 --> 05:47.280
No, not mine.

05:47.314 --> 05:50.850
- All right.
- Go ahead.

05:50.885 --> 05:52.785
- Easy.
- All right,

05:52.819 --> 05:54.052
it was a pleasure meeting you, sir.

05:54.086 --> 05:57.554
All right. Don't forget your lunchbox.

05:57.589 --> 06:01.293
- Good-bye, guys.
- All right.

06:01.328 --> 06:02.429
You know what, I think it'd be

06:02.464 --> 06:04.696
a nice change of pace if we came dressed

06:04.730 --> 06:05.864
as our favorite character,

06:05.898 --> 06:08.233
like, and personified it constantly...

06:08.268 --> 06:09.702
- He does... short round, every day.

06:09.736 --> 06:13.941
[All laughing]

06:13.975 --> 06:14.943
<i>Would you guys be interested
in the battle of the century?</i>

06:14.978 --> 06:17.315
Oh, yeah. Every comic book fan

06:17.349 --> 06:19.085
should have this book in their library.

06:19.119 --> 06:20.586
- Hi, guys.
- You remember Cari?

06:20.620 --> 06:22.020
- Hey, how are you doing?
- She's heading out

06:22.054 --> 06:23.388
for a job interview. She
asked if we could watch

06:23.423 --> 06:25.627
- the kid for like an hour.
- If you don't mind.

06:33.088 --> 06:34.790
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

06:34.824 --> 06:36.627
- All right, have a great day.
- Thank you.

06:36.661 --> 06:38.128
- How's it going?
- How you doing?

06:38.162 --> 06:39.196
<i>Would you guys be interested
in the battle of the century?</i>

06:39.230 --> 06:41.666
Oh, yeah. Mike, take a look.

06:41.700 --> 06:42.900
Oh, my God.

06:42.935 --> 06:44.567
This is the book that did it, man.

06:44.601 --> 06:46.538
This is the very first superhero crossover

06:46.573 --> 06:48.141
between Marvel and DC comics.

06:56.820 --> 06:58.486
Fans have always wanted to see

06:58.521 --> 07:00.689
their favorite
heroes go toe-to-toe,

07:00.723 --> 07:03.091
and this was the one
that fans only dreamed of.

07:03.126 --> 07:05.127
They never would have thought
it would ever come true.

07:05.161 --> 07:07.296
I mean, you just look at the
layout of this cover alone.

07:07.330 --> 07:08.866
I mean, it's one of the most iconic covers

07:08.900 --> 07:10.068
in comic book history.

07:10.103 --> 07:12.603
You know, you got the backdrop of New York.

07:12.637 --> 07:14.470
You got Spider-Man ready
to throw a Haymaker.

07:14.505 --> 07:17.406
Superman ready to just obliterate him.

07:17.440 --> 07:19.974
Every comic book fan should
have this book in their library.

07:20.009 --> 07:22.979
If you don't, you're missing out.

07:23.013 --> 07:25.247
I put it as the most anticipated comic book

07:25.281 --> 07:26.913
- in comic book history.
- Really?

07:26.948 --> 07:28.448
So this is historic, this book.

07:28.482 --> 07:30.252
I mean, it's more historic
than the bicentennial

07:30.286 --> 07:32.522
the year it came out. [All laughing]

07:32.556 --> 07:35.590
Bigger than the anniversary
of our nation's birth.

07:35.625 --> 07:37.459
[All laughing]

07:37.493 --> 07:39.160
I mean, it's the age old question

07:39.195 --> 07:40.260
if you're a comic book fan.

07:40.294 --> 07:41.693
Like, I wonder who's stronger?

07:41.727 --> 07:43.927
So the two, you know, iconic characters

07:43.962 --> 07:45.996
have this massive Throwdown.

07:46.030 --> 07:48.430
This is like a nerd's
wet dream right there.

07:48.465 --> 07:50.664
They went
fist-to-fist.

07:50.698 --> 07:53.334
Easy when you talk about
"wet dream" and "fist-to-fist."

07:53.368 --> 07:55.703
You might want to separate those.

07:55.738 --> 07:56.838
Where'd you get this?

07:56.872 --> 07:58.472
My mom gave it to me when I was a kid.

07:58.507 --> 08:00.071
I didn't want to read
anything else at the time,

08:00.105 --> 08:02.073
and this is what got me reading.

08:02.107 --> 08:03.075
- Okay.
- Yeah.

08:03.109 --> 08:05.576
- I was spoiled actually.
- Yeah.

08:05.611 --> 08:06.778
- You started at the top...
- Yep.

08:06.812 --> 08:09.148
And everything else was kind of like.

08:09.183 --> 08:11.552
And you're looking to
sell it today because?

08:11.586 --> 08:15.018
I want to start a grant
to get kids into comics.

08:15.052 --> 08:16.386
- Okay.
- So kids that might not be

08:16.420 --> 08:18.357
into sports or don't
want to read or anything,

08:18.391 --> 08:19.692
hopefully comics can reach them.

08:19.726 --> 08:22.428
That's a great cause.
I mean, I'm behind it.

08:22.462 --> 08:24.564
Like grooming future
customers for the store.

08:24.599 --> 08:26.366
I mean, I get behind that.

08:26.401 --> 08:28.234
Nothing wrong with that, right?

08:28.269 --> 08:29.703
All right, so what are
you looking to get for it?

08:29.737 --> 08:31.471
I was looking to get 50 bucks.

08:31.506 --> 08:33.739
- 50 bucks, huh?
- Yeah.

08:33.773 --> 08:36.275
Your cause alone is worth 50 bucks,

08:36.309 --> 08:40.879
so I'm not going to go into
the distasteful negotiation.

08:40.914 --> 08:42.481
- Appreciate that.
- 50 bucks.

08:42.515 --> 08:44.284
Tell the kids I'm
willing to do it today.

08:44.319 --> 08:45.752
Thank you.

08:45.786 --> 08:47.621
$50. All right, man, thank you.

08:47.656 --> 08:48.622
Thank you.

08:48.657 --> 08:49.623
- All right, fellas.
- Good luck.

08:49.657 --> 08:51.291
- Take it easy.
- Take care.

08:57.095 --> 08:59.065
- Hey, Ming.
- Hey, how are you?

08:59.100 --> 09:00.804
- Good, how are you?
- How are you doing?

09:00.838 --> 09:02.005
- Hey.
- Thank you so much

09:02.040 --> 09:03.741
- for helping me out today.
- No problem.

09:03.775 --> 09:05.945
- I really appreciate it.
- Absolutely, come on over.

09:05.980 --> 09:07.215
- Hi, guys.
- You remember Cari?

09:07.249 --> 09:09.350
- Hey, how are you doing?
- Good, how are you?

09:09.384 --> 09:10.416
- This is Quinn.
- Hello, Quinn.

09:10.451 --> 09:12.050
- This is Quinn.
- She's heading out

09:12.084 --> 09:13.485
for a job interview. She
asked if we could watch

09:13.520 --> 09:16.120
- the kid for like an hour.
- If you don't mind.

09:16.155 --> 09:17.120
- She's really good.
- For an hour?

09:17.154 --> 09:20.020
Yeah. I can handle an hour.

09:20.054 --> 09:21.255
Yeah, she's really good. I promise.

09:21.289 --> 09:22.557
All right, okay.

09:22.591 --> 09:24.491
Every so often, the stash will go above

09:24.524 --> 09:26.392
and beyond for a long-time customer.

09:26.426 --> 09:28.896
So our friend Cari was in
town for a job interview.

09:28.931 --> 09:30.166
She was in a little bit of a pickle,

09:30.200 --> 09:32.403
and asked if we could
watch her kid for an hour.

09:32.438 --> 09:33.938
You won't handle a comic book

09:33.972 --> 09:35.439
without white gloves, man.

09:35.473 --> 09:37.842
Here you are handling a human baby.

09:37.877 --> 09:40.211
People don't grade babies
like the C.G.C. does, you know.

09:40.245 --> 09:42.279
If you drop one here or
there, it's is no big deal.

09:42.314 --> 09:44.651
No.

09:44.685 --> 09:48.685
Very fine, good condition. [All laughing]

09:50.684 --> 09:52.885
She's been fed, she's
got a clean diaper.

09:52.919 --> 09:53.886
- She'll be a piece of cake.
- Okay.

09:53.921 --> 09:55.322
Everything you need is there.

09:55.356 --> 09:57.494
If she's anything like
her mom, she'll be easy.

09:57.530 --> 09:58.496
Whoa, what's that supposed to mean?

09:58.531 --> 10:00.600
- Whoa, hey.
- [All laughing]

10:00.634 --> 10:02.502
- I'm just saying mild-mannered.
- Sheesh.

10:02.537 --> 10:04.138
All right, you go, you land this job.

10:04.172 --> 10:06.939
- Knock 'em dead.
- You be good, okay.

10:06.973 --> 10:08.040
Thank you so much, guys.

10:08.075 --> 10:10.080
I will be back as soon as possible.

10:10.114 --> 10:11.581
- I promise.
- We got this under control.

10:11.615 --> 10:12.916
- Don't worry about it.
- Bye, my love.

10:12.950 --> 10:14.352
- Bye.
- We got you.

10:14.386 --> 10:16.657
They have the same size head those two.

10:16.691 --> 10:17.991
[All laughing]

10:18.025 --> 10:20.827
[Baby gurgling] I think
she likes you, Mike.

10:20.861 --> 10:22.496
Come here, girl. How are you?

10:22.531 --> 10:24.730
Oh, look at you. Yeah, that's right.

10:24.765 --> 10:27.033
- What's the baby's name again?
- Quinn.

10:27.067 --> 10:28.434
Oh, I don't like that.

10:28.469 --> 10:30.770
We're going to change
it? Let's change it up.

10:30.804 --> 10:33.270
Give her a more superhero
name in a comic book store.

10:33.305 --> 10:35.103
How about Moltar?

10:35.138 --> 10:38.005
Like a combination of Mike and Walter.

10:38.039 --> 10:40.406
- I like it.
- [All talking]

10:40.440 --> 10:42.675
- Yeah.
- What do you think, Moltar?

10:42.710 --> 10:43.975
I like just the on.

10:44.009 --> 10:45.142
No last name, it's unnecessary.

10:45.176 --> 10:46.309
- Moltar.
- Right.

10:46.343 --> 10:48.075
You know, what if
something happened to Cari

10:48.110 --> 10:49.276
going to that job interview,

10:49.310 --> 10:50.743
and then the baby was left in our care,

10:50.777 --> 10:52.810
you know, we became the baby's guardians.

10:52.844 --> 10:54.145
Then probably the dad would be like,

10:54.179 --> 10:55.982
"wait, where did she
drop off?" [All laughing]

10:56.017 --> 10:58.817
"Oh well, I guess it was
nice having a daughter."

10:58.851 --> 11:01.853
[All laughing]

11:01.887 --> 11:05.494
But just imagine a
baby raised at the stash.

11:05.528 --> 11:07.294
Dude, I swear to God
I thought that's how

11:07.329 --> 11:09.763
you got ming. [All laughing]

11:11.533 --> 11:12.500
Bulletman.

11:12.533 --> 11:13.901
That could go for a good 250.

11:13.935 --> 11:16.339
- I don't know, man.
- [Baby crying]

11:16.373 --> 11:18.412
I think Moltar probably would stop crying

11:18.446 --> 11:20.583
at about 50 bucks.

11:22.374 --> 11:26.112
Harrison Ford, man,
iconic titan of our youth

11:26.146 --> 11:28.849
in the biggest movies of our childhood.

11:28.884 --> 11:30.851
What was your favorite
Harrison Ford character?

11:30.885 --> 11:33.319
Presumably we're going
to lean towards han solo.

11:33.354 --> 11:35.453
Yeah, helped blow up the
death star in the first one,

11:35.487 --> 11:36.622
the ultimate character.

11:36.656 --> 11:37.623
What about you, man?

11:37.657 --> 11:38.824
Favorite Harrison Ford character?

11:38.859 --> 11:41.326
<i>Ooh, probably Deckard from blade runner.</i>

11:41.361 --> 11:43.291
Wow, that wasn't even in my top five.

11:43.325 --> 11:45.161
But yet that's massive and iconic.

11:45.195 --> 11:47.463
Yeah, I actually like
it better than han solo.

11:47.497 --> 11:49.062
- What?
- Yeah.

11:49.096 --> 11:51.428
Han solo's the kind of guy
that'll just blow somebody away.

11:51.463 --> 11:52.829
He's like, "sorry about the mess."

11:52.864 --> 11:54.464
<i>You did watch empire all the way</i>

11:54.499 --> 11:55.796
<i>through to return of the jedi, right?</i>

11:55.831 --> 11:57.598
- Yeah, why?
- That ain't the same han solo

11:57.633 --> 11:58.634
that he was in the first one.

11:58.668 --> 11:59.670
[All laughing]

11:59.704 --> 12:01.570
Like who, when they're going down

12:01.605 --> 12:04.038
in that carbonite thing, isn't like,

12:04.072 --> 12:06.976
"eff you," instead of like, "I love you"?

12:07.010 --> 12:09.314
- [Laughs]
- Excuse me.

12:09.348 --> 12:11.147
He did not say, "I love you."

12:11.181 --> 12:13.981
She said, "I love you,"
and he goes, "I know."

12:14.016 --> 12:16.282
Well, he did get caught by Ewoks, though.

12:26.753 --> 12:30.388
Got a serious subject that every father

12:30.423 --> 12:32.895
will have to face sooner or later.

12:32.929 --> 12:35.432
When their daughter brings home their dates

12:35.466 --> 12:37.933
to meet with the approval
or the disapproval

12:37.967 --> 12:39.099
of their parents.

12:39.134 --> 12:40.632
I'm familiar with the latter.

12:40.667 --> 12:43.135
[All laughing]

12:43.170 --> 12:44.837
We all got to think about
it as fathers, you know.

12:44.872 --> 12:46.204
Eventually it's going to happen.

12:46.238 --> 12:48.206
You're not fathers to this kid, man.

12:48.241 --> 12:50.642
It's a kid that somebody
dropped off at the store.

12:50.676 --> 12:52.510
You don't have to answer
these big questions.

12:52.544 --> 12:53.844
The only question you have to answer is,

12:53.878 --> 12:55.645
"can I get the kid back now?" "Yes, please,

12:55.679 --> 12:58.013
- take the kid back."
- But, you know, we...

12:58.047 --> 13:02.749
- "not the mama!"
- [All laughing]

13:02.783 --> 13:05.718
I imagine Moltar will
only date superheroes though.

13:05.752 --> 13:08.558
I mean, she's too good
to just date somebody

13:08.592 --> 13:10.058
- without super powers.
- Sure.

13:10.092 --> 13:11.391
That's true.

13:11.426 --> 13:12.891
Nothing less than a justice league member.

13:12.926 --> 13:14.360
Or superman.

13:14.395 --> 13:16.566
I think that... I think yes.

13:16.601 --> 13:19.301
Lois Lane just better watch out.

13:19.335 --> 13:22.608
Well, I don't want to
be prejudiced or anything,

13:22.643 --> 13:25.045
but superman isn't a human.

13:25.079 --> 13:26.981
- Ooh.
- What are you saying?

13:27.015 --> 13:28.785
- Nothing.
- I won't have you spreading

13:28.820 --> 13:32.187
that small-minded nonsense around Moltar.

13:32.222 --> 13:34.391
Yeah, you're not allowed
to be around Moltar anymore.

13:34.425 --> 13:36.426
The reason Moltar will be a xenophobe.

13:36.460 --> 13:37.992
[Laughs]

13:43.466 --> 13:46.072
Look at that little chalupa dance, huh.

13:46.106 --> 13:48.107
Look at that, funny little legs.

13:48.142 --> 13:49.743
- Hey, man, what's up?
- How are we doing, guys?

13:49.777 --> 13:50.811
- Good.
- Cute kid.

13:50.845 --> 13:51.813
How can we help you?

13:51.847 --> 13:54.814
Well, I've got Bullethead.

13:54.848 --> 13:56.014
Bulletman.

13:56.048 --> 13:57.549
Bulletman, Bullethead, same thing.

13:57.583 --> 13:59.216
I was originally going
to call him Missilehead.

13:59.251 --> 14:01.050
Oh, whatever.

14:10.358 --> 14:11.624
You remember this, Mike?

14:13.793 --> 14:15.993
This is one of my most
favorite toys growing up.

14:16.027 --> 14:17.094
I mean, it's got to be one of

14:17.129 --> 14:19.032
the greatest designed toys of all time.

14:19.066 --> 14:20.167
Well, when I originally saw it,

14:20.201 --> 14:22.166
the onesie was a little,
like, questionable,

14:22.201 --> 14:24.871
but from what I understand,
he's pretty cool, you know.

14:24.906 --> 14:27.408
- I mean, he's very cool.
- Onesies aside.

14:27.442 --> 14:28.941
[All laughing]

14:28.976 --> 14:31.113
âª Bullet Man, the human bullet âª

14:31.147 --> 14:32.382
- [All laughing]
- Oh,

14:32.416 --> 14:34.352
one of the most amazing toys of all time,

14:34.386 --> 14:36.220
I believe from the G.I. Joe adventure team,

14:36.255 --> 14:38.587
but the best part of all, he had a cowl.

14:38.622 --> 14:40.455
The only other superhero that I ever saw,

14:40.488 --> 14:42.254
like Batman, that had a cowl, man.

14:42.288 --> 14:44.153
But it was shaped like a bullet,

14:44.187 --> 14:45.589
with two slits in the eyes.

14:45.623 --> 14:47.458
Shaped like a bullet's
one way to put it.

14:47.493 --> 14:48.727
[All laughing]

14:48.761 --> 14:50.996
That's true. And
through the adult prism,

14:51.030 --> 14:52.263
when you look at him now, you're like,

14:52.298 --> 14:57.569
does it vibrate? [All laughing]

14:57.603 --> 14:59.337
I always was upset though because he was

14:59.371 --> 15:01.372
- so much bigger than my Megos.
- Yeah.

15:01.406 --> 15:03.840
You know, you had to, like,
suspend belief a little bit

15:03.874 --> 15:05.708
when you played with your
mego Spider-Man or something.

15:05.742 --> 15:07.910
Here, hold him, Moltar. It's okay.

15:07.945 --> 15:09.412
- [Crying]
- Where'd you get it?

15:09.447 --> 15:10.713
I got it at my grandmother's house,

15:10.747 --> 15:13.179
and evidently it belonged
to my older brother.

15:13.214 --> 15:14.846
As I was cleaning out, he didn't want it,

15:14.880 --> 15:15.913
I don't know much about it,

15:15.947 --> 15:17.214
except for what the Internet told me,

15:17.249 --> 15:19.417
so I figured I'd see
what I could do with it.

15:19.451 --> 15:20.621
What are you looking to get for it?

15:20.655 --> 15:22.458
Well, from searching
online, I could get...

15:22.493 --> 15:24.794
- that can go for a good 250.
- I don't know.

15:24.829 --> 15:26.897
[Crying]

15:26.932 --> 15:29.867
She's very uncomfortable
hearing a 250 quote.

15:29.901 --> 15:32.100
I think Moltar probably would stop crying

15:32.135 --> 15:33.800
at about 50 bucks.

15:33.834 --> 15:35.802
- 50 bucks?
- Yeah.

15:35.837 --> 15:37.474
Oh, you're using an infant

15:37.508 --> 15:40.643
to sweeten the deal? [Laughs]

15:40.678 --> 15:42.677
He'd been using this
to trade on, cuteness.

15:42.711 --> 15:45.582
[All laughing]

15:45.617 --> 15:46.817
The plan wasn't going that well.

15:46.851 --> 15:49.585
[All laughing]

15:49.619 --> 15:53.291
250 is usually for this thing complete.

15:53.326 --> 15:55.663
This is not complete, unfortunately.

15:55.697 --> 15:57.130
There's a tear right there,

15:57.165 --> 16:00.267
and this sticker, not original,

16:00.301 --> 16:01.568
and he doesn't have his belt.

16:01.602 --> 16:03.235
That's right, he had a belt.

16:03.270 --> 16:05.605
But it's got the helmet
and the other stuff, you know.

16:05.640 --> 16:08.009
I was... I can
go for 240.

16:08.043 --> 16:10.177
You don't want to make
this baby sad, do you?

16:10.211 --> 16:13.509
If we think about
it, you know, maybe 200.

16:13.544 --> 16:15.777
- 200?
- 200 is pretty much the lowest

16:15.812 --> 16:17.312
that I can even think about going.

16:17.347 --> 16:19.515
100 bucks? For something you just found?

16:19.550 --> 16:20.952
Didn't even know you had?

16:20.986 --> 16:23.122
Didn't even know the name, what it was.

16:23.157 --> 16:24.356
Come on, bro.

16:24.390 --> 16:27.229
How can you say no to this face?

16:27.263 --> 16:30.399
Just do it.

16:30.434 --> 16:31.867
- All right, all right.
- All right, 100 bucks.

16:31.902 --> 16:34.840
Shake the man's hand, I got
baby slobber all over mine.

16:34.874 --> 16:37.876
Yes, here is your first transaction.

16:37.910 --> 16:40.279
That's right.

16:40.314 --> 16:42.418
There you go, my friend. Thank you.

16:42.452 --> 16:44.419
- Yeah.
- Thanks, man.

16:44.453 --> 16:45.988
- All right, take care, guys.
- All right.

16:46.022 --> 16:47.653
- Hey, guys.
- You're back.

16:47.688 --> 16:49.489
- How was she?
- She was excellent.

16:49.524 --> 16:51.092
I mean, she even helped
us with a transaction.

16:51.126 --> 16:52.293
Who's Moltar?

16:52.327 --> 16:54.958
We... um... [Chuckles]

17:04.916 --> 17:06.351
Do you hear that?

17:06.385 --> 17:07.583
That's the sound of commerce.

17:07.748 --> 17:09.818
This is where we put all the money.

17:09.852 --> 17:10.984
Yeah, see that?

17:11.019 --> 17:12.884
I mean, I was envisioning, you know,

17:12.919 --> 17:15.454
raising the ultimate comic book retailer

17:15.489 --> 17:16.656
at our hands, you know.

17:16.690 --> 17:17.922
Meanwhile your own
kids at home are like,

17:17.955 --> 17:19.356
"what about us, dad?" [All laughing]

17:19.390 --> 17:21.023
"We'd like to learn about
retail," and he's like,

17:21.059 --> 17:23.228
"no, no, no. Stranger babies only."

17:23.262 --> 17:24.596
[All laughing]

17:26.429 --> 17:28.228
A lot of people are
going to want to come in,

17:28.262 --> 17:29.797
and they want to do transactions,

17:29.831 --> 17:31.198
they want to sell you something,

17:31.233 --> 17:33.367
and they're always going
to have this sob story.

17:33.401 --> 17:36.301
They'll say, "oh, but my
dad had this comic book.

17:36.336 --> 17:38.170
"It's worth so much more because of all

17:38.204 --> 17:40.472
the sentimental value." And you'll say,

17:40.507 --> 17:43.307
"no, it's not." Huh?

17:43.342 --> 17:44.943
Got it.

17:44.977 --> 17:46.745
You know where it's at.

17:46.780 --> 17:47.746
Okay, I'm not going to lie.

17:47.780 --> 17:49.013
I really thought it was cool

17:49.047 --> 17:50.277
to have her in there... in the store.

17:50.312 --> 17:51.579
It's new, it's bubbly.

17:51.614 --> 17:54.083
There's a smell of fresh air in the room.

17:54.118 --> 17:59.121
We started to really bond,
Moltar and the stash crew.

17:59.156 --> 18:00.690
You couldn't ask for a better baby for us.

18:00.725 --> 18:03.027
You're not supposed
to ask for a baby at all.

18:03.062 --> 18:04.761
[All laughing]

18:04.795 --> 18:07.531
It's a comic book store.

18:07.565 --> 18:09.833
Yeah, help me stock the shelves.

18:09.867 --> 18:11.668
That's right.

18:13.571 --> 18:16.407
[Baby yelling]

18:17.674 --> 18:21.442
[Baby gurgling]

18:27.946 --> 18:31.448
- Enjoy.
- Thanks, man, have a good one.

18:31.482 --> 18:34.485
Fun, right?

18:34.519 --> 18:37.091
<i>This is Alan Moore's the killing joke.</i>

18:37.127 --> 18:39.061
They are not going to
show you this in preschool,

18:39.095 --> 18:41.594
so really, I'm doing you a huge favor.

18:41.629 --> 18:43.196
You're going to be ahead of everybody.

18:43.230 --> 18:45.466
Can you laugh like the Joker?

18:45.500 --> 18:46.467
Give me a Joker laugh.

18:46.502 --> 18:50.938
[Imitates Joker]

18:50.972 --> 18:52.506
No?

18:52.541 --> 18:54.642
The world needs jokers, right?

19:02.824 --> 19:04.091
Hey, guys.

19:04.126 --> 19:06.560
- Hey, you're back.
- Yep.

19:06.595 --> 19:08.329
- How was she?
- She was excellent.

19:08.363 --> 19:10.331
I mean, she even helped us
with a transaction today,

19:10.365 --> 19:12.333
- and got a real good deal.
- Good, good.

19:12.367 --> 19:14.534
Complete angel. She was amazing.

19:14.568 --> 19:16.102
Who's Moltar?

19:16.136 --> 19:18.405
We... um... [Chuckles]

19:18.439 --> 19:20.107
All good things must come to an end,

19:20.142 --> 19:22.377
and Cari came back and, you know,

19:22.411 --> 19:24.345
she wanted to take Moltar home.

19:24.379 --> 19:27.347
What a shame when a
mother wants her own child

19:27.381 --> 19:28.748
to nurture and love.

19:28.782 --> 19:32.219
Has to take it away from
the kid's newest fans.

19:32.254 --> 19:34.486
You were reduced to Fanboys yourselves

19:34.520 --> 19:35.620
over a baby.

19:35.654 --> 19:36.889
That baby was C10.

19:36.923 --> 19:40.260
If she was going to get
an official grade from...

19:40.295 --> 19:43.997
- if we were ever going
to slab that baby, C10.

19:44.032 --> 19:45.568
Couldn't breathe, but C10.

19:45.602 --> 19:47.905
[All laughing]

19:47.939 --> 19:49.339
See you later. We're going to miss you.

19:49.373 --> 19:51.340
Here, baby.

19:51.374 --> 19:53.607
- Come on.
- Don't worry, Moltar.

19:53.642 --> 19:55.308
There's always going to be
a place for you at the stash.

19:55.342 --> 19:57.413
Oh, thank you for taking
her. I really appreciate it.

19:57.448 --> 20:00.081
Hey, hey, wait... take this with you too.

20:00.115 --> 20:02.117
I mean, when she cries, she likes this.

20:02.151 --> 20:04.653
Oh, see this, you like this?

20:04.687 --> 20:07.791
You like superman? Here.

20:07.825 --> 20:09.492
- Say, "thank you."
- Bye.

20:09.527 --> 20:11.394
- We'll see you soon.
- See you later.

20:11.428 --> 20:12.963
- Bye.
- Bye, Moltar.

20:12.997 --> 20:14.635
Quinn.

20:14.669 --> 20:16.570
As babysitters, aren't we entitled to

20:16.604 --> 20:20.004
the going rate of $2 an hour?

20:20.038 --> 20:21.172
Feel like we just got ripped off.

20:21.207 --> 20:23.309
[All laughing]

20:23.344 --> 20:24.642
Wild, dude. I... it's...

20:24.676 --> 20:27.444
there aren't many things
that reduce you guys

20:27.478 --> 20:30.180
to bleeding hearts.
Apparently, a baby's one of 'em.

20:30.215 --> 20:33.579
I got to tell you, man,
the estrogen at the stash

20:33.613 --> 20:35.481
was at alarming levels.

20:35.515 --> 20:37.616
I mean, we were all on the same
cycle for months after that.

20:37.650 --> 20:41.284
[All laughing]

20:41.319 --> 20:42.454
Oh man, I hear the dinner bell.

20:42.488 --> 20:44.588
That means the episode must be at an end.

20:44.622 --> 20:46.556
For Comic Book Men, I'm Kevin Smith.

20:46.590 --> 20:48.156
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

20:48.191 --> 20:49.424
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

20:49.458 --> 20:52.457
Rock-a-bye, baby, in the comic shop,

20:52.492 --> 20:55.860
when the baby leaves, all their faces drop.

20:55.895 --> 20:57.175
Good night.

20:57.175 --> 21:00.353
