15:32.564 --> 15:34.897
Anyone perceived

15:34.932 --> 15:36.900

16:08.411 --> 16:10.602
- It said so.

16:19.429 --> 16:21.044
Wait! Stop!

16:30.724 --> 16:33.543
Coolest bike ever.

16:35.732 --> 16:37.135

 you dont understand.

16:58.094 --> 16:59.508
No, i get it, i get it.

16:59.509 --> 17:01.078
The first rule of
robot fight club is..

17:01.078 --> 17:02.819
You dont talk about 
 robot fight club.

17:03.254 --> 17:04.867
What you need 
 understand is that...

17:04.902 --> 17:07.387
I dont want a bunch of crazy
 talking vehicles...

17:07.422 --> 17:09.606
Following me around
 trying to get me kill!

17:11.482 --> 17:13.569
Look, Jack, is it?

17:13.605 --> 17:15.907
Your personal safety is
 exactly why...

17:15.907 --> 17:18.303
Optimus Prime is requested your presence

17:18.698 --> 17:19.625
Optimus whom?

17:19.626 --> 17:22.222
You maybe in danger
because you one of the few...

17:22.257 --> 17:25.223
one of the only who have ever seen us

17:25.259 --> 17:27.218
Dude, what are you waiting for?

17:27.885 --> 17:29.385
Go with!

17:30.342 --> 17:31.842
Scrap.

17:39.794 --> 17:42.120
And why exactly are
 we taking her?

17:42.607 --> 17:44.107
Rules.

18:23.829 --> 18:25.525
I thought they were two.

18:25.560 --> 18:28.232
Haven't you heard?
humans multiply

18:29.891 --> 18:32.007
- I am Raf.
- I am Miko.

18:32.042 --> 18:33.542
Who are you?

18:33.651 --> 18:35.151
Bulkhead.

18:35.594 --> 18:38.497
Are you a car? i bet you a truck,
 a monster truck!

18:38.532 --> 18:40.391
You like heavy metal?
How much do you weigh?

18:40.426 --> 18:42.857
Ever used a wrecking ball
 for a punching bag?

18:43.587 --> 18:46.837
So of you guys are robots,
 who made you?

18:48.280 --> 18:50.265
Oh, please

18:55.784 --> 18:58.364
We are auotonomous robotic
 organisms

18:58.399 --> 19:00.421
From the Planet Cybertron.

19:00.456 --> 19:03.178
Also known as
 Autobots.

19:04.377 --> 19:05.808
Why are you here?

19:05.809 --> 19:09.903
To protect your planet,
 from the Decepticons.

19:10.147 --> 19:12.665
The joker who tried 
 to bomb of us last night?

19:13.751 --> 19:16.358
Okay.
Why they here?

19:17.742 --> 19:19.381
A fair question, Jack.

19:19.416 --> 19:23.881
in part they are here because
 our planet is uninhabitable.

19:24.320 --> 19:27.136
Ravaged by 
 centuries of civil war.

19:27.674 --> 19:29.778
Why were you'll fighting a war?

19:30.222 --> 19:34.296
For most, over control
of our world supply of energon

19:34.756 --> 19:39.824
The fuel and life blood
 of all Autobots and Decepticons like

19:42.769 --> 19:47.060
The combat was fierce
and then you heard for centuries

19:47.792 --> 19:49.292
in the begining

19:49.407 --> 19:52.921
I fought alongside one whom
 i considered a brother.

19:56.011 --> 19:59.053
But in war, idealis
can be corrupted.

19:59.982 --> 20:01.482
And it was last...

20:02.877 --> 20:05.481
That Megatron lost his way.

20:08.158 --> 20:09.658
Is there gonna be a quiz?

20:10.422 --> 20:12.062
So what is Megatron...

20:12.097 --> 20:15.322
Or any of these
 have to do with us?

20:15.792 --> 20:19.726
Megatron was not been seen
or a heard from in sometimes

20:20.072 --> 20:22.292
But if his return is imminent...

20:22.327 --> 20:26.453
As i fear,
it could be a catastrophic.

20:31.776 --> 20:35.198
Those transmission are imminenting
from deep space.

20:35.748 --> 20:38.902
I would hate to waste the energon...

20:39.519 --> 20:43.503
Unless you are
absolutely certain.

20:46.525 --> 20:49.080
Then lock on
transmission coordinate...

20:49.115 --> 20:51.821
And activated the space bridge.

21:14.171 --> 21:16.011
Decepticons!

21:16.980 --> 21:19.622
I have returned
