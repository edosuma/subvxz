I'm Dying Up Here...

00:06.153 --> 00:07.514
How did they not
shoot you in 'Nam?

00:07.594 --> 00:08.795
There's nothing but bamboo over there.

00:08.875 --> 00:10.677
What tree could you have
possibly fucking hid behind?

00:10.757 --> 00:12.639
I heard Johnny had Rickles
on the other night.

00:12.719 --> 00:13.860
That's fresh.

00:13.960 --> 00:17.024
Can't get any more "dog
bites man" than that.

00:17.124 --> 00:18.185
This is Sparky.

00:18.285 --> 00:19.326
You didn't think he
would come to Hollywood

00:19.406 --> 00:21.848
to see his big-shot brother?
He's not my brother.

00:21.928 --> 00:23.951
I can't see the weather girl!

00:24.051 --> 00:25.592
Sparky...

00:25.692 --> 00:27.134
I'm saying, your manager should
get you gigs, and that's it.

00:27.214 --> 00:30.117
Shouldn't be trying to fit you
into somebody else's box.

00:30.217 --> 00:33.280
It's nice having a
comedian as a girlfriend.

00:33.380 --> 00:35.963
<i>You've never
called me that before.</i>

00:36.063 --> 00:37.324
<i>Is that what this is?</i>

00:37.424 --> 00:38.825
<i>Gotta love the comedian.</i>

00:38.905 --> 00:41.568
But to be honest, I was kind
of hoping for the girlfriend.

00:41.668 --> 00:42.970
You don't think comedy lasts?

00:43.070 --> 00:44.851
We get something better.

00:44.951 --> 00:46.613
We get the moment.

00:46.713 --> 00:49.816
You know, we get the right-fucking-now.

I've been watching
these Watergate hearings.

01:59.426 --> 02:01.268
I can't help thinking how
much better a president

02:01.348 --> 02:03.410
you'd have made than Tricky Dick.

02:03.510 --> 02:04.371
Ha-ha.

02:04.471 --> 02:05.972
I feel like a pig at a trough

02:06.072 --> 02:07.814
with all the material he's providing.

02:07.914 --> 02:09.336
That's hell in a handbasket.

02:10.477 --> 02:12.419
Mitch, you got a light?

02:12.519 --> 02:14.141
Howard.

02:14.241 --> 02:15.942
Wow, good to see you.
How are you?

02:16.042 --> 02:19.666
Enjoying the Roman orgy of
comedy that is our presidency.

02:20.767 --> 02:22.509
Glad you stopped by to say hello.

02:22.609 --> 02:25.072
Howard's gonna be on the show this week.

02:25.172 --> 02:26.913
Wonderful.

02:27.013 --> 02:28.034
Well.

02:28.134 --> 02:30.557
Thrilled to have you back.

02:30.657 --> 02:32.199
Better lock the door.

02:32.299 --> 02:33.480
Ed's in the building.

02:35.182 --> 02:37.724
Shit, uh, Mitch, can I
talk to you for a sec?

02:37.824 --> 02:40.367
Sorry, Howard, I'll have
him back to you in a jiff.

02:40.467 --> 02:42.289
It's about his drinking at work.

02:42.389 --> 02:46.273
Ah.

02:47.834 --> 02:50.937
Jesus, Mitch, Howard Leetch?

02:51.037 --> 02:53.740
Last week it was Foster
Brooks and Nipsey Russell.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.743
What are we now, a fucking
Dean Martin roast?

02:56.843 --> 03:00.227
Why don't you tell that to
Pepto-Bismol and Rice Krispies?

03:00.327 --> 03:02.229
Screw the sponsors.

03:02.329 --> 03:04.511
We're known for discovering comics,

03:04.611 --> 03:08.335
not reminding the audience
which ones are still alive.

03:10.937 --> 03:14.761
I don't care if that kid stepped
in front of a Boeing 747.

03:14.861 --> 03:17.764
Get the young guys back.

03:35.121 --> 03:38.104
What about Disneyland?

03:38.204 --> 03:40.987
What about-- what about Disneyland?

03:41.087 --> 03:43.089
Didn't you ever want to meet Mickey?

03:45.131 --> 03:48.795
I want to meet Mickey.

03:48.895 --> 03:51.478
Hey, remember that girl
who lost her mouse ears

03:51.578 --> 03:53.240
on that people-mover thingy?

03:53.340 --> 03:54.961
She jumped on the tracks to get them

03:55.061 --> 03:57.884
and missed her car and ran out an exit.

03:57.984 --> 03:59.806
She fell 30 feet,

03:59.906 --> 04:01.848
had to be in a body brace.

04:01.948 --> 04:03.890
She had a pin put in her leg.

04:03.990 --> 04:05.252
Eat up.

04:05.352 --> 04:08.975
We gotta meet the
mattress guy in an hour.

04:09.075 --> 04:12.619
Would you jump 30 feet for ears?

04:16.202 --> 04:18.945
I have jumped a lot farther

04:19.045 --> 04:21.047
for a lot less.

04:37.263 --> 04:40.927
You know in Detroit, the pipes
can handle a man's business.

04:41.027 --> 04:42.849
I don't even own a plunger.

04:42.949 --> 04:45.852
Yeah, it's obviously some
sort of LA plumbing defect.

04:45.952 --> 04:47.214
It's got nothing to do with

04:47.314 --> 04:49.816
the litter of piglets you
just tried to flush, Pop.

04:49.916 --> 04:51.137
Yeah.

04:51.237 --> 04:52.499
Whatever you say, Billy.

05:02.569 --> 05:04.731
You know, I was watching
<i>Looney Tunes</i> the other day.

05:04.811 --> 05:07.754
You know, Daffy Duck,
Bugs Bunny, and the boys.

05:07.854 --> 05:10.557
And they had this cartoon
about black people called

05:10.657 --> 05:12.799
"Scrub Me Mama with a Boogie Beat."

05:14.981 --> 05:17.083
And I thought, boogie beat? Finally.

05:17.183 --> 05:19.926
A cartoon about my
people with some soul.

05:20.026 --> 05:22.409
But this shit was about
a bunch of black people

05:22.509 --> 05:24.691
living in a place called Lazy Town.

05:26.793 --> 05:28.014
Now, first of all,

05:28.114 --> 05:30.697
my people built this country for free

05:30.797 --> 05:33.139
from 1619 till about

05:33.239 --> 05:34.901
mm...yesterday.

05:36.843 --> 05:39.586
So if anybody earned the right
to take it easy, it's us.

05:41.167 --> 05:42.789
I got so mad 'cause I was like, what?

05:42.889 --> 05:46.553
Another racist depiction
reinforcing the stereotype

05:46.653 --> 05:49.356
that all black people are lazy.

05:49.456 --> 05:50.937
Now, I would have turned that shit off

05:51.017 --> 05:53.239
if my set wasn't halfway
across the room.

05:55.502 --> 05:59.286
But in my defense, I did
have my La-Z-Boy recliner

05:59.386 --> 06:02.369
set all the way back to
righteous-indignation setting.

06:04.110 --> 06:06.573
So I was comfortable and
making a statement.

06:14.561 --> 06:16.843
You look like shit.

06:18.405 --> 06:19.606
I see somebody's been working on

06:19.686 --> 06:21.548
their people skills while I was away.

06:24.050 --> 06:27.113
I hear you been doing
the <i>Playboy</i> circuit.

06:27.213 --> 06:30.397
How's that?

06:30.497 --> 06:31.478
Distracting.

06:33.379 --> 06:35.722
You, uh, talk to the fellas?

06:35.822 --> 06:37.824
Not yet.

06:40.827 --> 06:42.829
Sorry to hear about Clay.

06:43.950 --> 06:46.292
Good guy.

06:46.392 --> 06:48.394
Such is life, right?

06:53.440 --> 06:55.522
What can I do for you, Nick?

06:57.363 --> 06:59.786
I got <i>The Tonight Show.</i>

06:59.886 --> 07:01.107
Really?

07:01.207 --> 07:02.509
I go up Wednesday.

07:02.609 --> 07:05.271
How'd you pull that off?

07:05.371 --> 07:06.993
Last week,

07:07.093 --> 07:09.916
working the Playboy Club in New Orleans.

07:10.016 --> 07:12.118
One of Mitch's scouts
from <i>The Tonight Show's</i>

07:12.218 --> 07:14.120
fucking a Bunny there, saw my act,

07:14.220 --> 07:17.524
and I landed in LA this morning.

07:17.624 --> 07:19.285
Grandkids gonna love that story.

07:24.390 --> 07:27.313
It's a lot more eyes on you, Nick.

07:28.434 --> 07:30.957
Been a good boy for two years, so...

07:34.360 --> 07:36.523
That's good to hear.

07:40.807 --> 07:42.509
So how are you on fifth chances?

07:44.931 --> 07:47.113
How are you on other options?

07:47.213 --> 07:49.396
If I had a hat,
it'd be in my hand.

07:50.697 --> 07:52.358
I need to go up.

07:52.458 --> 07:55.201
Wednesday's coming up fast.

07:55.301 --> 07:58.204
Can't get any
further west than this.

07:59.385 --> 08:00.647
You fuck up here,

08:00.747 --> 08:03.089
you'll be performing
balls-deep in seawater.

08:14.280 --> 08:16.282
When you want to go up?

08:17.524 --> 08:19.065
Tonight?

08:19.165 --> 08:21.147
Be a nice perk if I could bump Bill.

08:21.247 --> 08:24.350
You are lucky
you're a funny fuck.

08:24.450 --> 08:26.192
Arnie!

08:26.292 --> 08:27.994
Just remember who your friends are.

08:30.496 --> 08:32.337
<i>Yeah, I used to
wrestle in high school,</i>

08:32.418 --> 08:34.280
but as soon as I'd come, I'd quit.

08:34.380 --> 08:36.523
Alex, how are you? Was
the kitchen on fire?

08:36.623 --> 08:38.924
Good to see you, kid.

08:39.025 --> 08:41.287
Whoa, Jesus, not this asshole.

08:41.386 --> 08:43.590
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, we got a
special treat for you tonight.</i>

08:43.669 --> 08:46.052
<i>Mr. Nick Beverly. Nick
Beverly, give it up!</i>

08:46.152 --> 08:47.734
<i>Come on! Let him hear it!</i>

08:51.357 --> 08:52.719
Thomas Fitzgerald, everyone.

08:52.799 --> 08:54.200
Let's keep it going for Fitzy, huh?

08:56.683 --> 08:58.384
This is Fitzy's home club.

08:58.484 --> 08:59.586
It's also his actual home.

09:01.327 --> 09:03.209
So if you're feeling generous,
leave a jacket behind.

09:03.289 --> 09:04.891
He'll use it for a blanket
right here in about an hour.

09:04.971 --> 09:06.713
You got to be fucking kidding me.

09:06.813 --> 09:08.114
How are ya?

09:08.214 --> 09:09.796
- Who is that guy?
- Looking good.

09:09.896 --> 09:11.558
Depends on the night.

09:11.658 --> 09:12.979
Been thinking about
social issues a lot lately.

09:13.059 --> 09:15.802
Lot of injustice out there, you know?

09:15.902 --> 09:17.924
Talking to a black friend
of mine the other day.

09:18.024 --> 09:21.047
The whole time, I kept thinking,

09:21.147 --> 09:22.949
this guy's dick's probably
bigger than mine.

09:24.831 --> 09:26.252
Just not fair.

09:26.352 --> 09:28.735
That got me all philosophical, you know?

09:28.835 --> 09:32.258
I-I came to a conclusion that
if every man in the world

09:32.358 --> 09:34.941
had the same size cock,

09:35.041 --> 09:36.623
there'd be no more racism.

09:36.723 --> 09:38.945
That would be it.

09:39.045 --> 09:41.147
Can we agree on a size?
Can we put it to a vote?

09:41.247 --> 09:43.790
Show of hands here? Five
inches, six inches?

09:43.890 --> 09:45.451
Can I get a seven? This
guy's holding out.

09:45.531 --> 09:46.793
What do you want, 15? Come on.

09:48.334 --> 09:49.656
I love, though, that
you women want to have

09:49.736 --> 09:51.918
bigger cocks in your life. Love it.

09:52.018 --> 09:53.800
But why?

09:53.900 --> 09:57.243
Why, when you don't use the
cocks you have access to now?

09:58.745 --> 09:59.706
Seriously, you know if you got

09:59.786 --> 10:00.867
a bigger cock in your life,

10:00.947 --> 10:02.689
you would stop using it in a week.

10:02.789 --> 10:04.671
It's like that exercise
bike you insisted on

10:04.751 --> 10:06.192
that sits in the corner of your bedroom

10:06.272 --> 10:07.794
with a bunch of dirty
clothes hanging on it.

10:09.195 --> 10:10.436
Baby, you want to see eight inches?

10:10.516 --> 10:12.038
You come backstage and see me twice.

10:15.642 --> 10:18.424
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.

10:18.524 --> 10:20.266
I'm doing Carson this week.

10:20.366 --> 10:21.407
Yeah.

10:21.487 --> 10:23.349
Yeah. Wednesday night.

10:25.171 --> 10:27.053
So I got to work on a couple
jokes that don't have

10:27.133 --> 10:28.835
you know, dick and cock in 'em.

10:28.935 --> 10:31.277
I got two so far so I
hope you enjoy 'em.

10:38.504 --> 10:40.226
- All right.
- So dickhead over here

10:40.306 --> 10:41.708
is at the bar with two cops, right?

10:41.788 --> 10:42.588
- Mm-hmm.
- And-and, uh,

10:42.669 --> 10:43.890
he starts pointing at me.

10:43.990 --> 10:45.572
Look, a bank had just been held up.

10:45.672 --> 10:47.934
There's red pubic hair all
over the crime scene.

10:48.034 --> 10:50.076
It seems fairly obvious
you're the prime suspect.

10:50.156 --> 10:51.057
Signature move.

10:52.278 --> 10:53.379
Fuck you. Fuck you.

10:53.479 --> 10:55.682
Pubes are everywhere. Fuck you.

10:55.762 --> 10:57.143
So one of the cops grabs Nick,

10:57.243 --> 10:58.765
slams him against the bar,
and cuffs him, right?

10:58.845 --> 11:00.466
So I stumble over, I'm all shitfaced.

11:00.566 --> 11:01.768
I throw my arm around him and I'm like,

11:01.848 --> 11:03.189
what the fuck is going on?

11:03.289 --> 11:04.410
Can you just cut to
the part where you guys get

11:04.490 --> 11:06.092
locked up and start blowing
guys for cigarettes?

11:06.172 --> 11:07.834
Come on.

11:07.934 --> 11:09.335
This isn't about the Mexican
day-care system, okay, Edgar?

11:09.415 --> 11:10.877
Ooh. He knows your childhood.

11:12.658 --> 11:15.762
So, turns out Nick had said some
not-so-nice words to the cop.

11:15.862 --> 11:17.884
Tell 'em what you said.

11:17.984 --> 11:19.986
Oh, that was a long time ago.

11:22.348 --> 11:23.930
Well,

11:24.030 --> 11:25.451
they haul-so they haul us in,

11:25.551 --> 11:27.854
and then-then we have to,
uh, spend the night in...

11:27.954 --> 11:29.736
Protective custody. Yeah.

11:29.836 --> 11:31.137
Wow.

11:31.237 --> 11:33.379
White people have the best jail stories.

11:33.479 --> 11:35.161
That's some
bullshit right there.

11:35.241 --> 11:36.843
If y'all were black, the
story would have ended up

11:36.923 --> 11:38.204
of how the cops had to explain

11:38.284 --> 11:40.286
how you hung yourself
with your own shoelaces.

11:40.366 --> 11:41.728
Yeah, but, what
I want to know, Nick,

11:41.808 --> 11:43.169
is where you've been
the last three years.

11:43.249 --> 11:44.771
I mean, besides being
on the T-and-A circuit.

11:44.851 --> 11:46.192
Yeah.

11:46.292 --> 11:47.513
Where haven't I been?

11:47.613 --> 11:49.315
Probably blowing
a bunch of guys.

11:49.415 --> 11:50.877
Fuck, Edgar.

11:50.977 --> 11:52.819
Little one-note with the
blowjob jokes, right?

11:52.899 --> 11:55.181
I'm sorry, it's just like a song
that gets stuck in your head.

11:55.261 --> 11:57.043
Come on, let him talk. I want to know.

11:57.143 --> 11:58.044
All right.

11:58.144 --> 12:00.606
Yeah, Nick, where you been?

12:00.706 --> 12:02.929
Let's see, uh...

12:03.029 --> 12:04.450
- Did a lot of drugs.
- Mm-hmm.

12:04.550 --> 12:06.372
- As you all know.
- Yes, we do.

12:06.472 --> 12:08.534
Uh, lot of drinking.

12:08.634 --> 12:11.217
Banged my fair share of Bunnies.

12:11.317 --> 12:13.019
Found Jesus.

12:13.119 --> 12:14.340
Lost him again.

12:14.440 --> 12:15.902
Easy to lose.

12:16.002 --> 12:17.964
Entertained everything
from running for office

12:18.044 --> 12:20.186
to holding up a bank.

12:20.286 --> 12:22.068
Worked blue collar, white collar,

12:22.168 --> 12:24.110
you name it.

12:24.210 --> 12:25.571
And in the end, the
only thing that made me

12:25.651 --> 12:28.034
not want to hook a hose
to my exhaust pipe

12:28.134 --> 12:30.516
was being a fuckin' comic.

12:30.616 --> 12:33.159
So I did the one thing
that no comic's ever done.

12:33.259 --> 12:35.321
Pick up a check?

12:35.421 --> 12:37.123
I got my shit together.

12:37.223 --> 12:39.686
I was sort of hoping it
was gonna be pick up the check

12:39.786 --> 12:42.568
because I had a waffle and
I only have a dollar.

12:42.668 --> 12:44.170
Fuck, Edgar.

12:45.992 --> 12:47.774
That's a great story, Kerouac.

12:47.874 --> 12:48.975
Thank you.

12:49.075 --> 12:50.977
But let's ask the real question.

12:51.077 --> 12:53.339
How the fuck did you get Carson?

12:56.402 --> 12:57.944
Not gonna like the answer, Bill.

12:58.044 --> 13:01.087
Can't dislike it any more
than I do the question.

13:04.250 --> 13:05.391
Well, Bill,

13:05.491 --> 13:07.193
it turns out

13:07.293 --> 13:09.275
that unlike you,

13:09.375 --> 13:11.117
I'm really fucking funny.

13:13.940 --> 13:16.723
One! Two!

13:16.823 --> 13:18.564
Three! He's out!

13:39.205 --> 13:42.108
Thank you. Uh,
next song is about love.

13:42.208 --> 13:43.389
I had the tuna.

13:43.489 --> 13:45.031
Oh. Right.

13:45.131 --> 13:46.873
Tuna for the young Ingrid Bergman.

13:46.973 --> 13:48.314
Ingrid Bergman was a whore.

13:48.414 --> 13:49.735
That she slept with
that Guinea director,

13:49.815 --> 13:51.397
a real piece of work.

13:51.497 --> 13:52.518
Okay.

13:52.618 --> 13:54.080
Can I get you guys anything else?

13:54.180 --> 13:55.922
Some pickles would be lovely, dear.

13:56.022 --> 13:58.084
Pickles, sure thing.

14:02.108 --> 14:03.569
Hey, Gracja,

14:03.669 --> 14:05.071
have you ever considered expanding

14:05.151 --> 14:06.552
the deli's entertainment to include

14:06.632 --> 14:08.654
actual entertainment?

14:08.754 --> 14:10.456
That not entertainment.

14:10.556 --> 14:11.417
Sister.

14:12.758 --> 14:14.300
Well, you know, I was thinking

14:14.400 --> 14:16.342
an open mic for comics might work here.

14:16.442 --> 14:18.144
A lot of places are doing it.

14:18.244 --> 14:19.745
You already have the space.

14:19.845 --> 14:22.028
Might bring in a few extra customers.

14:22.128 --> 14:25.031
And comedy is very hot right now.

14:25.131 --> 14:26.432
If I do it,

14:26.532 --> 14:30.076
will you stop talking
jokes to the customers?

14:30.176 --> 14:31.497
If I'm not on stage, it'll be nothing

14:31.577 --> 14:34.040
but soup of the day from here on out.

14:34.140 --> 14:35.521
Okay.

14:35.621 --> 14:36.803
I try.

14:36.903 --> 14:39.725
But not paying anybody.

14:39.825 --> 14:41.808
You sure you never ran
a comedy club before?

14:43.709 --> 14:45.651
Okay.

14:59.845 --> 15:00.746
Yes?

15:00.846 --> 15:03.349
Hey, I'm, uh, Adam Proteau.

15:03.449 --> 15:05.031
Barton Royce sent me.

15:05.131 --> 15:07.153
You're early.

15:07.253 --> 15:10.596
Yeah, well, I hitchhiked,
so it's kind of

15:10.696 --> 15:12.158
hard to be accurate.

15:37.083 --> 15:38.384
It's not a zoo, Adam.

15:38.484 --> 15:40.386
We thrive on discretion.

15:40.486 --> 15:42.188
Yeah, I can see that.

15:42.288 --> 15:44.670
Ours. Not theirs.

15:48.534 --> 15:50.136
So I don't think
I caught your name.

15:50.216 --> 15:51.717
Sonja.

15:51.817 --> 15:56.042
So, this is your room
when we don't need it.

15:56.142 --> 15:58.684
Hey, so them girls out there,
they--they prostitutes?

15:58.784 --> 15:59.765
Models.

15:59.865 --> 16:01.167
Barton didn't fill you in?

16:01.267 --> 16:03.489
Roof over my head, $25 a week,

16:03.589 --> 16:06.172
and handyman work, that's about it.

16:06.272 --> 16:08.134
We run an exclusive modeling agency

16:08.234 --> 16:11.697
that caters to a very
high-end clientele.

16:11.797 --> 16:13.659
Since when did models

16:13.759 --> 16:17.143
blow guys by swimming pools?

16:17.243 --> 16:19.665
Since always.

16:19.765 --> 16:21.647
Can't believe Barton
didn't say nothing about

16:21.727 --> 16:24.150
this place being a whorehouse.

16:24.250 --> 16:26.272
We like to think of
ourselves as courtesans,

16:26.372 --> 16:29.315
here to entertain members of nobility.

16:29.415 --> 16:32.919
You get a lot of nobility up in here?

16:33.019 --> 16:35.081
That model blowing the guy by the pool?

16:35.181 --> 16:38.804
She gets $1,000 an
hour for her services.

16:38.904 --> 16:41.687
That fucking noble enough for you?

16:41.787 --> 16:43.609
Your work clothes.

16:43.709 --> 16:45.751
Don't be seen without them on.

16:56.001 --> 16:58.584
You gotta be shittin' me.

16:58.684 --> 17:00.166
<i>You're telling us we
gotta risk our lives</i>

17:00.246 --> 17:01.807
<i>just because somebody might need help.</i>

17:01.887 --> 17:04.470
What time is
your family getting back?

17:04.569 --> 17:06.152
Dad took the dog to the vet.

17:06.252 --> 17:08.054
Susie went with him to take
pictures of what's left

17:08.134 --> 17:09.155
of the Hollywood sign.

17:09.255 --> 17:10.376
What's the matter with him?

17:10.455 --> 17:11.958
Dad? Well, judging by

17:12.058 --> 17:13.919
the stool sample he
provided the other day--

17:14.019 --> 17:15.881
Sparky.

17:15.981 --> 17:17.762
Who the fuck knows? He's old.

17:17.863 --> 17:20.246
Dog's a fucking asshole anyway.

17:20.346 --> 17:22.367
"Dog's a fucking asshole."

17:22.468 --> 17:24.730
You did not just say that.

17:24.829 --> 17:26.412
You don't know Sparky like I do.

17:26.512 --> 17:28.534
The total dick.

17:28.634 --> 17:30.896
Fuck, he's a dog, Bill.

17:30.996 --> 17:32.979
Sparky's not just a dog.

17:33.079 --> 17:34.820
He's the son my father never had.

17:34.920 --> 17:36.302
Seriously.

17:36.402 --> 17:37.803
My dad would come home from work and

17:37.883 --> 17:39.205
us kids and my mom would be there

17:39.285 --> 17:41.227
and he wouldn't say one word.

17:41.327 --> 17:44.670
He'd pick up that dog and he
would hug it and kiss it.

17:44.770 --> 17:47.153
Not like we gave a fuck.

17:47.253 --> 17:49.875
Hey, you want to go to Canter's?

17:49.975 --> 17:51.637
Come on, your treat.

17:51.737 --> 17:53.719
Why?

17:53.819 --> 17:55.221
We have a full box of Lucky Charms

17:55.301 --> 17:56.602
just waiting in my cabinet.

17:56.702 --> 17:58.524
Come on, the guys'll probably be there.

17:58.624 --> 18:01.007
It'll be good to get out of the house.

18:01.107 --> 18:02.608
"The guys"?

18:02.708 --> 18:04.730
Like Eddie or Nick?

18:04.830 --> 18:06.532
Or Sully and Ralph.

18:06.632 --> 18:07.373
Yeah.

18:07.473 --> 18:09.095
What? What?

18:09.195 --> 18:11.817
You really gonna play stupid?
Come on, Cass.

18:11.917 --> 18:14.380
You went all Pavlov's pussy
the other night at Canter's

18:14.480 --> 18:15.681
every time Nick opened his mouth.

18:15.761 --> 18:17.143
- Jesus, Bill.
- Am I wrong?

18:17.243 --> 18:19.145
Why do you have to be such an asshole?

18:19.245 --> 18:21.547
You hung on his every word.

18:21.647 --> 18:24.530
The guy's fucking Clay
without the tread marks.

18:27.092 --> 18:28.594
Cass, come on.

18:28.694 --> 18:31.037
I didn't mean it. Stay.

18:31.137 --> 18:33.139
Can't you ever try to be
just a little bit better

18:33.219 --> 18:35.801
than you were the day before, ever?

18:35.901 --> 18:39.325
Just this much? Once?

18:39.425 --> 18:42.408
All right. I'm fucking sorry!

18:46.752 --> 18:48.334
So you want us to leave this deli

18:48.434 --> 18:49.975
to go to another deli?

18:50.075 --> 18:51.757
- It's an open mic.
- And it's gonna stay that way.

18:51.837 --> 18:53.339
Wait, what is this place again?

18:53.439 --> 18:55.941
Donimirski's, it's a
Polish deli in the Valley.

18:56.041 --> 18:57.683
And you gotta order something to go up.

18:57.763 --> 18:59.205
So make sure you bring money.

18:59.285 --> 19:00.626
Wait, I gotta pay them to go up?

19:00.726 --> 19:02.908
I admit, it's not
exactly ideal, okay?

19:03.008 --> 19:04.310
Do I get an extra five minutes

19:04.410 --> 19:05.851
if I order, like, a side or some shit?

19:05.931 --> 19:07.713
- Yeah.
- Hey, do they deliver?

19:07.813 --> 19:08.934
'Cause I'll be anywhere
except that fuckin' deli.

19:09.014 --> 19:09.935
Okay, I don't understand.

19:10.015 --> 19:11.417
we played strip clubs in Boston.

19:11.497 --> 19:12.938
Because we got paid and
we were surrounded

19:13.018 --> 19:14.880
by naked women, not old people eating

19:14.980 --> 19:16.182
while God points to his watch.

19:16.262 --> 19:17.763
Hey, it's a place where we can go up

19:17.863 --> 19:20.326
to work on our material
before we go up at Goldie's.

19:20.426 --> 19:21.627
Well, I do got some new material

19:21.707 --> 19:24.350
that could use some trying out.
Sort of like a new direction.

19:24.430 --> 19:26.051
You think they'd be cool with it?

19:26.151 --> 19:28.294
Trust me, after a month of
Bob Dylan's Polish aunt,

19:28.394 --> 19:31.056
short of you playing soccer
with a puppy, they're game.

19:31.156 --> 19:32.538
Well, all men suck,

19:32.638 --> 19:34.079
so the least one of you assholes can do

19:34.159 --> 19:35.981
is buy me some fries and a Diet Pepsi.

19:36.081 --> 19:38.584
That is the worst jingle
for Kotex I ever heard.

19:38.684 --> 19:40.246
Uh, excuse me, can we
get an order of, uh,

19:40.326 --> 19:41.527
fries and a Diet Pepsi, please?

19:41.607 --> 19:43.429
Thank you. I'll pay you back on Friday.

19:43.529 --> 19:45.471
I know how you can pay
Eddie back right now.

19:45.571 --> 19:48.354
He's looking for comics for his
new open mic at Donimirski's.

19:48.454 --> 19:49.835
Is that a new club?

19:49.935 --> 19:51.277
No-no-no-no-no, it's not a club.

19:51.377 --> 19:52.298
- It's a deli.
- Mm-hmm.

19:52.378 --> 19:53.639
Like a <i>deli</i> deli?

19:53.739 --> 19:56.081
I'm waiting tables at
a deli in the Valley

19:56.181 --> 19:57.703
and they got stage space
so I just thought,

19:57.783 --> 19:59.205
you know, what the hell? It's...

19:59.305 --> 20:00.586
Hey, if there's a mic, an audience,

20:00.666 --> 20:02.328
and a plate of pierogies, I'm in.

20:02.428 --> 20:04.149
Wait, but what
about Goldie's rule of us

20:04.230 --> 20:05.891
playing at other clubs?

20:05.991 --> 20:06.932
It's not a club.

20:07.032 --> 20:07.853
It's a deli.

20:08.994 --> 20:10.976
Jinx, you owe me a bag of coke.

20:39.425 --> 20:41.327
My man from another land!

20:41.427 --> 20:43.809
Oh, they...feed you
Hollywood types well, huh?

20:43.909 --> 20:45.671
Well, I see you still
ugly as a motherfucker.

20:45.751 --> 20:46.852
How 'bout that?

20:46.952 --> 20:48.494
Come on, let's go to the car.

20:48.594 --> 20:49.855
Mm.

20:49.955 --> 20:51.577
Oh, man.

20:51.677 --> 20:52.998
There's some white women here in LA...

20:53.078 --> 20:54.460
- God damn.
- Oh, yeah.

20:54.560 --> 20:55.821
Like that?

20:58.484 --> 20:59.705
God damn!

20:59.805 --> 21:01.567
No wonder most of us is
in the halfway house

21:01.647 --> 21:03.208
'cause you fuckin' took the rest of it.

21:04.930 --> 21:07.032
Oh, look, that's how
you know you made it.

21:07.132 --> 21:09.755
Black ass on a white couch, huh.

21:09.855 --> 21:10.836
You mind if I?

21:10.936 --> 21:12.037
Nah.

21:12.137 --> 21:13.719
- You wanna hit?
- Nah, I'm good.

21:13.819 --> 21:15.120
Well, there's better than good.

21:15.220 --> 21:16.502
You know what? Other than in the case

21:16.582 --> 21:17.763
of a drink here and there,

21:17.863 --> 21:20.446
I don't trust the stuff. I'm clean.

21:20.546 --> 21:22.608
I buy that.

21:22.708 --> 21:24.410
Think it's really fucked up.

21:24.510 --> 21:26.412
But I buy that.

21:28.514 --> 21:29.575
Mm.

21:29.675 --> 21:30.496
You build that?

21:30.596 --> 21:32.458
This? Yeah.

21:32.558 --> 21:34.460
Took me a couple of months.

21:34.560 --> 21:37.062
But I am almost done.

21:37.162 --> 21:38.824
Little varnish...

21:38.924 --> 21:40.926
Oh.

21:44.650 --> 21:47.393
So what are you doing, man?

21:47.493 --> 21:49.154
I'm a security guard.

21:49.254 --> 21:50.436
That's cool.

21:50.536 --> 21:52.878
Nigga, no it ain't.

21:54.980 --> 21:57.042
It definitely ain't. That
shit sound terrible.

22:00.025 --> 22:01.126
I'm going to night school.

22:01.226 --> 22:02.768
Oh, good. Good.

22:02.868 --> 22:03.689
Mm-hmm.

22:03.789 --> 22:05.371
Refrigerator repair.

22:05.471 --> 22:07.453
That shit sound steady.

22:07.553 --> 22:09.555
Mm-hmm. Mm.

22:11.597 --> 22:13.078
Hey, what happened to that, uh,

22:13.158 --> 22:15.381
girl you were seeing, uh, Lorraine?

22:15.481 --> 22:17.263
Oh, she gone.

22:17.363 --> 22:19.365
Yeah.

22:21.046 --> 22:22.067
Man,

22:22.167 --> 22:24.390
look at you, man.

22:24.490 --> 22:26.031
Hollywood Ralph, boy, look at that.

22:27.773 --> 22:29.275
It's a long way from 'Nam, ain't it?

22:29.375 --> 22:31.377
Not long enough.

22:35.260 --> 22:37.002
You ever,

22:37.102 --> 22:39.285
you know, think about the shit we did?

22:39.385 --> 22:41.387
Why would I?

22:44.069 --> 22:46.892
Oh, 'cause you can't not?

22:49.835 --> 22:51.837
Crazy fuckin' times.

22:56.882 --> 22:58.504
Yeah.

22:58.604 --> 23:00.606
Mm.

23:02.007 --> 23:03.669
- Yeah, give me that.
- Yeah.

23:03.769 --> 23:07.052
That's what I thought.

23:12.297 --> 23:13.619
I was recently performing comedy

23:13.699 --> 23:15.401
in Playboy Clubs across America.

23:15.501 --> 23:18.263
Yeah, <i>Playboy</i> and America.

23:19.985 --> 23:22.968
And what amazed me most
was the amount of women

23:23.068 --> 23:25.411
who want to be Playboy Bunnies.

23:26.512 --> 23:28.454
Yeah. I had no idea

23:28.554 --> 23:30.776
that there were that many
shitty fathers out there.

23:30.876 --> 23:32.578
Seriously.

23:32.678 --> 23:34.940
Playboy Bunnies don't
just happen, people.

23:35.040 --> 23:37.142
All right, they're not
born into the wild.

23:37.242 --> 23:39.545
A lot of serious parental neglect

23:39.645 --> 23:41.206
goes into the making of a good Bunny.

23:42.688 --> 23:44.229
Dads, we got any dads in here?

23:44.329 --> 23:46.792
You show up sober for
one birthday party?

23:46.892 --> 23:48.373
You're sending her down
the slippery slope

23:48.454 --> 23:49.635
of a higher education.

23:49.735 --> 23:51.997
I promise you that...

23:52.097 --> 23:53.278
Hey, you seen Cassie?

23:53.378 --> 23:55.481
No.

23:55.581 --> 23:56.722
Hey,

23:56.822 --> 23:58.444
he can't do any of this on Carson.

23:58.544 --> 23:59.905
His first five minutes were Carson.

23:59.985 --> 24:02.207
This is actual humor.

24:02.307 --> 24:04.530
Billy.

24:04.630 --> 24:07.092
I think we're gonna get going.

24:07.192 --> 24:08.654
What? I'm going up.

24:08.754 --> 24:10.816
Dad's worried about Sparky.

24:10.916 --> 24:12.337
Sparky's fine, Dad.

24:12.437 --> 24:14.059
He's been alone too long,

24:14.159 --> 24:16.742
and unless you want dog
piss all over the place...

24:16.842 --> 24:17.583
I'm up next.

24:17.683 --> 24:19.905
Fifteen minutes.

24:20.005 --> 24:22.067
We'll be home within the hour.

24:22.167 --> 24:25.070
And rats?

24:25.170 --> 24:27.593
All right.

24:27.693 --> 24:30.115
And turn
it into a shittier diamond.

24:30.215 --> 24:31.677
I'm not married.

24:31.777 --> 24:33.659
I am looking, though.
Relationships are hard.

24:33.739 --> 24:35.360
What do you think? You know? Really.

24:35.460 --> 24:37.082
I feel like animals have it the best.

24:37.182 --> 24:38.123
Two dogs meet.

24:38.223 --> 24:39.805
A sniff here, sniff there.

24:40.786 --> 24:42.127
They get to have sex,

24:42.227 --> 24:43.869
and then it's right back
to chasing squirrels.

24:45.991 --> 24:47.493
No one's mad that no one called.

24:47.593 --> 24:49.615
You know, there's no guilt trip.

24:49.715 --> 24:52.538
- You never get one of those...
- Spike?

24:52.638 --> 24:55.941
Yeah, it's Fluffy.

24:56.041 --> 24:59.384
Fluffy, white terrier, remember?

24:59.484 --> 25:02.628
You were off your leash, I was in heat?

25:02.728 --> 25:04.670
You said my bark was

25:04.770 --> 25:05.631
infectious.

25:07.533 --> 25:09.114
Uh, Fluffy, ye-uh-yeah,

25:09.214 --> 25:11.396
- I was-I was gonna call.
- I was just gonna

25:11.496 --> 25:12.958
just gonna call.

25:13.058 --> 25:15.881
Don't, Spike, don't.

25:15.981 --> 25:17.843
You demean us both when you lie, okay?

25:19.625 --> 25:22.207
Fluffy,
just let me come over.

25:22.307 --> 25:24.890
We can just...talk.

25:26.632 --> 25:27.853
"Just talk."

25:29.675 --> 25:31.457
You think I was born yesterday?

25:31.557 --> 25:33.338
I'm two for Chrissake.

25:35.360 --> 25:37.863
Fluffy, why-why-why
does it have to be like this?

25:37.963 --> 25:39.905
You're not
hearing me, Spike.

25:42.007 --> 25:43.989
You're not hearing me, okay?

25:44.089 --> 25:46.952
If we're out, and I feel
your wet snout rub across

25:47.052 --> 25:49.434
my deliciously beautiful
tight, puckered anus...

25:50.976 --> 25:52.618
I will take that as an act of aggression

25:52.698 --> 25:55.561
and I swear, I will rip that
tube of lipstick you call a cock

25:55.661 --> 25:57.082
right out of its socket!

26:04.149 --> 26:04.970
True.

26:07.753 --> 26:10.616
Well, thank you.

26:10.716 --> 26:13.218
Uh, you been a great audience,

26:13.318 --> 26:14.860
slightly on the older side,

26:14.960 --> 26:16.862
so I appreciate you coming out so late,

26:16.962 --> 26:18.904
seeing how it's nine
o'clock and a lot of you

26:19.004 --> 26:21.466
have to get up for breakfast
in about an hour.

26:22.567 --> 26:23.789
Uh--uh-huh.

26:26.571 --> 26:29.474
We are out of the beef barley soup.

26:29.574 --> 26:31.677
86 beef barley.

26:31.777 --> 26:32.998
Okay.

26:33.098 --> 26:35.400
Our next comic is a very funny guy,

26:35.500 --> 26:37.963
Adam Proteau, he will
be up here shortly.

26:38.063 --> 26:40.005
Thanks.

26:40.105 --> 26:41.466
Hey, you sure that anything goes here?

26:41.546 --> 26:43.148
'Cause all of my stuff
is still pretty raw.

26:43.228 --> 26:45.611
Well, that's what places
like this are for.

26:45.711 --> 26:47.372
Okay.

26:47.472 --> 26:49.234
It looks like a George
Romero movie in here.

26:49.314 --> 26:50.676
Give it up for Eddie
Zeidel, ladies and gentlemen...

26:50.756 --> 26:52.197
Hey, this is how you get better, okay?

26:52.277 --> 26:53.819
Expand your audience.

26:53.919 --> 26:55.120
Play in rooms you're
not supposed to be in.

26:55.200 --> 26:56.722
Yeah, I mean, I definitely agree about

26:56.802 --> 26:58.363
the "I'm not supposed
to be in here" part.

26:58.443 --> 26:59.545
Um, my name's Adam...

26:59.645 --> 27:02.628
Man, I'm sorry, I...

27:02.728 --> 27:05.290
Well, tonight I want to talk
to y'all about fucking.

27:08.894 --> 27:10.636
Oh, God.

27:10.736 --> 27:13.839
But you--y'all- y'all
still fucking, right?

27:13.939 --> 27:15.961
Melvin, get your black ass out here.

27:16.061 --> 27:17.002
Coming, man.

27:19.104 --> 27:20.405
This is what you wearing?

27:20.505 --> 27:23.148
What, something wrong?
Man, the war is over, man.

27:23.228 --> 27:25.210
Why you holding onto this?
This shit is beat.

27:25.310 --> 27:27.813
Oh.

27:27.913 --> 27:29.955
You know, when I was there, all
I could think about was here.

27:30.035 --> 27:31.596
And now I'm here, all I
think about is there.

27:31.677 --> 27:32.818
Man, you...

27:32.918 --> 27:34.459
That's your problem. You stuck.

27:34.559 --> 27:36.401
You think a cop wears his
uniform when he's off-duty?

27:36.481 --> 27:38.223
Hell no. You off-duty.

27:38.323 --> 27:39.184
Now, give me that.

27:39.284 --> 27:40.025
Give you what?

27:40.125 --> 27:41.426
That jacket.

27:41.526 --> 27:44.029
Look, my weight has
fluctuated over the years

27:44.129 --> 27:45.971
so I'm sure I got something
in my closet that'll fit you.

27:46.051 --> 27:46.912
Now, give me this.

27:47.012 --> 27:49.074
No, man.

27:49.174 --> 27:51.176
Give me that jacket, man.

27:56.301 --> 27:58.443
Ha, all right.

27:58.543 --> 28:00.005
There he is.

28:00.105 --> 28:03.709
Now, you hold on, let me
get you some fly shit.

28:09.915 --> 28:11.617
You raised by degenerate gamblers?

28:11.717 --> 28:15.060
No, salt of the Earth, the pair of them.

28:15.160 --> 28:16.341
Just didn't take.

28:18.243 --> 28:21.386
Goldie tells me that
Johnny's had a change of heart.

28:21.486 --> 28:22.868
You bringing the kids back up.

28:22.968 --> 28:24.770
Oh, yeah, I had to put my
foot down with Johnny.

28:24.850 --> 28:27.993
I told him flat out, either
you bring those kids back

28:28.093 --> 28:30.716
or you don't 'cause it's your show.

28:30.816 --> 28:32.437
I only work here.

28:32.537 --> 28:34.479
A call would have been nice.

28:34.579 --> 28:35.841
Pardon?

28:35.941 --> 28:38.083
You know, a phone call?

28:38.183 --> 28:41.486
Save you a schlep to New
Orleans to find a fuckin' kid.

28:43.068 --> 28:45.530
You are like a dog with a
bone, did you know that?

28:45.630 --> 28:47.372
I told you,

28:47.472 --> 28:49.634
I had a guy who happened to be
in New Orleans and saw him.

28:49.714 --> 28:52.457
He's gonna be playing
your club all month long.

28:52.557 --> 28:54.419
We all win.

28:54.519 --> 28:56.501
You're just lucky you
suck so bad at cards,

28:56.601 --> 28:57.763
that's all I'm saying, Mitch.

28:57.843 --> 28:59.004
Oh, ho, well.

28:59.084 --> 29:01.146
I love you, too.

29:01.246 --> 29:02.487
You know who you got
to get in your club?

29:02.567 --> 29:04.029
Is Riggs and King.

29:04.129 --> 29:06.111
My God, did you see those numbers?

29:06.211 --> 29:09.374
50 million people.
50 million people.

29:09.454 --> 29:10.996
For tennis.

29:11.096 --> 29:12.537
Can you imagine what
those numbers would be

29:12.617 --> 29:14.019
for something that was
actually interesting?

29:14.099 --> 29:15.580
Well, networks are paying attention.

29:15.660 --> 29:16.842
They want to capitalize.

29:16.942 --> 29:18.303
Everybody is looking for things

29:18.383 --> 29:20.806
Jane can do as well as Tarzan.

29:20.906 --> 29:22.207
And what about comedy?

29:22.307 --> 29:23.909
I could put together a group of women,

29:23.989 --> 29:27.012
make them pee their pants faster
than bad Nielsen ratings.

29:27.112 --> 29:29.014
Okay. Who?

29:29.114 --> 29:30.175
Diller? Rivers?

29:30.275 --> 29:31.937
We've seen the usual suspects.

29:32.037 --> 29:33.779
I'm talking up-and-comers.

29:33.879 --> 29:36.261
I got girls got bigger
laughs in my place

29:36.361 --> 29:38.103
than you in a swimsuit.

29:39.805 --> 29:41.386
Hey, you could call your special,

29:41.486 --> 29:42.948
"Girls Are Funny Too."

29:43.048 --> 29:43.809
Oh.

29:43.889 --> 29:45.230
Eh, but only because

29:45.330 --> 29:47.032
"Men Are Sexist Fucking Pricks"

29:47.132 --> 29:49.074
wouldn't get past the censors.

29:50.816 --> 29:52.677
Oh, I got the girls.

29:52.777 --> 29:55.440
You just wouldn't dare put them on.

29:55.540 --> 29:57.542
- I don't know.
- Mm-hmm.

30:01.827 --> 30:03.969
All right, let me guess.
Brother and sister?

30:04.069 --> 30:06.611
Oh. 53 years.

30:06.711 --> 30:08.593
All right, that's disgusting.
That should be illegal.

30:10.115 --> 30:12.177
How long did you date
before you got married?

30:12.277 --> 30:15.020
We didn't date. He courted me.

30:15.120 --> 30:17.062
"Courted." Oh, I love that.

30:17.162 --> 30:19.464
I haven't been courted since
I let Gary Dorfheimer

30:19.564 --> 30:21.546
get to second base in a
McDonald's parking lot.

30:23.288 --> 30:25.130
So what do you think, is there
any hope for me, even though

30:25.210 --> 30:27.592
I'm, you know, giving out
free milk at McDonald's?

30:29.054 --> 30:30.675
You just need to meet the right one.

30:30.775 --> 30:32.097
You know, that's what everybody says.

30:32.177 --> 30:33.278
You'll find the right one.

30:33.378 --> 30:34.259
Well, how am I supposed to recognize

30:34.339 --> 30:35.680
that needle in the haystack?

30:35.780 --> 30:38.764
The needle finds you.

30:38.864 --> 30:42.727
I was going after his brother.

30:42.827 --> 30:44.089
What a floozy!

30:46.111 --> 30:47.853
What made you switch?

30:47.953 --> 30:49.534
He hears me.

30:49.634 --> 30:51.696
Oh, so, he's a good listener?

30:51.796 --> 30:54.179
Anyone can listen.

30:54.279 --> 30:56.521
Very few hear.

30:59.044 --> 31:00.625
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

31:00.725 --> 31:02.387
Don't rub it in, bitch.

31:06.291 --> 31:08.513
You come up
with that on the spot?

31:08.613 --> 31:09.554
Well...

31:09.654 --> 31:10.635
Sparky?

31:10.735 --> 31:11.877
- Sometimes.
- Here, boy!

31:13.698 --> 31:15.120
Really fun tonight, Bill.

31:15.220 --> 31:16.481
Thanks.

31:16.581 --> 31:18.483
I haven't seen Dad laugh
like that since...

31:18.583 --> 31:20.205
Mmm, Hiroshima?

31:20.305 --> 31:21.927
You're terrible.

31:22.027 --> 31:23.608
- Well, it's true.
- No!

31:23.708 --> 31:24.890
No! No!

31:28.873 --> 31:30.375
Oh, God.

31:30.475 --> 31:33.458
He's barely breathing.
Call an ambulance.

31:33.558 --> 31:35.500
I don't--I don't think
they come for dogs, Dad.

31:35.600 --> 31:37.823
Then just bring the fucking car around!

31:47.252 --> 31:49.995
You know, I really
liked your idea last night.

31:50.095 --> 31:51.316
Hm?

31:52.417 --> 31:55.200
The women in comedy thing.

31:57.382 --> 32:00.926
The only time Johnny opens doors
for women is in restaurants.

32:01.026 --> 32:02.928
Nah-nah-nah-nah, screw <i>The Tonight Show.</i>

32:03.028 --> 32:06.331
CBS would be all over this.

32:06.431 --> 32:10.335
Come on, <i>Maude, The
Mary Tyler Moore Show.</i>

32:10.435 --> 32:12.938
Well, there's nothing like a dame.

32:13.038 --> 32:16.461
Why don't you put together
a proposal, you know,

32:16.561 --> 32:19.784
see who you think makes the
grade, female-comic wise?

32:19.884 --> 32:23.028
And we'll take it out. Together.

32:23.128 --> 32:26.111
Run it up Freddie Silverman's
pole, see if he salutes?

32:26.211 --> 32:27.592
Why not?

32:27.692 --> 32:30.755
Would it make me a producer?

32:30.855 --> 32:33.518
It would make us producers.

32:35.900 --> 32:37.522
I'm gonna do something for you

32:37.622 --> 32:40.125
I haven't done for a man in 20 years.

32:40.225 --> 32:41.366
Oh, yeah?

32:41.466 --> 32:42.527
Mm, what's that?

32:42.627 --> 32:44.449
Make you breakfast.

32:47.752 --> 32:50.215
Oh, yeah!

32:50.315 --> 32:52.017
Oh, fuck.

32:52.117 --> 32:55.340
Oh, oh.

32:55.440 --> 32:58.743
Oh, you gotta be shitting me right now.

32:58.843 --> 33:00.845
Oh!

33:03.248 --> 33:04.269
Hey.

33:04.369 --> 33:06.391
It's eight in the morning.

33:06.491 --> 33:08.113
You still got people going at it?

33:08.213 --> 33:10.115
You see a time clock?

33:10.215 --> 33:13.398
We're more of a "when the
mood hits you" business.

33:13.498 --> 33:15.400
You know how to work a washing machine?

33:15.500 --> 33:18.043
Yeah. Yeah, I guess, why?

33:18.143 --> 33:21.366
Maid's sick. Sheets need to be changed.

33:21.466 --> 33:23.508
Are you seriously asking me
to wash a whole bunch of

33:23.588 --> 33:25.290
whores' comed-on bed linens?

33:25.390 --> 33:27.492
Use it as motivation.

33:27.592 --> 33:29.014
Who knows?

33:29.114 --> 33:30.615
Maybe one day you'll be successful

33:30.715 --> 33:32.917
and someone will be cleaning
your comed-on sheets.

33:35.720 --> 33:37.702
I'm just saying it's not
cool, man, all right?

33:37.802 --> 33:40.705
You--you just walked
out on me last night.

33:40.805 --> 33:42.787
I wanted to perform at
your deli, I swear,

33:42.887 --> 33:44.509
but this opportunity came up

33:44.609 --> 33:46.171
to shove an eight-foot cactus up my ass

33:46.251 --> 33:47.652
and--I mean, you see my dilemma here.

33:47.732 --> 33:48.633
You're such a dick.

33:48.733 --> 33:49.955
I mean, even Cassie gets it.

33:50.055 --> 33:51.436
She was so good last night.

33:51.536 --> 33:52.437
Aw.

33:52.537 --> 33:54.079
People really respond to her.

33:54.179 --> 33:55.560
Is it just me,

33:55.660 --> 33:57.762
or did your dick move
when you said that?

33:57.862 --> 33:59.965
Oh, I--I think it did. Yeah.

34:00.065 --> 34:01.646
Come on, man.

34:01.746 --> 34:02.847
Just give it a shot.

34:02.947 --> 34:03.969
- Dude, I...
- Once.

34:04.069 --> 34:05.770
Come on. Come on.

34:05.870 --> 34:07.572
What do you got to lose? Come on.

34:07.672 --> 34:09.614
All right, all right, fine, fine.

34:09.714 --> 34:11.536
- Just do me one favor.
- Sure.

34:11.636 --> 34:15.500
Move like four feet that way.
You smell like a salami farted.

34:15.600 --> 34:17.141
Sorry.

34:17.242 --> 34:18.683
<i>He just buried
him in my backyard.</i>

34:18.763 --> 34:20.225
He didn't even ask.

34:20.324 --> 34:22.067
He just dug it.

34:22.167 --> 34:24.429
Now I got a big dirt speed
bump on the way to my hibachi.

34:24.529 --> 34:25.929
Yeah, well, it's not like he could bring

34:26.010 --> 34:27.831
a dead dog back to Michigan, that's--

34:27.931 --> 34:30.594
He's not going back.
Never going back.

34:30.695 --> 34:32.297
If he does, how's he
gonna put fresh flowers

34:32.377 --> 34:34.359
every week on Sparky's grave?

34:34.458 --> 34:36.601
It's like fucking Joe
DiMaggio and Marilyn.

34:36.701 --> 34:38.163
Hey, Bill, your dad is grieving.

34:38.263 --> 34:39.344
Why don't you cut him some slack?

34:39.424 --> 34:40.605
What?

34:40.705 --> 34:42.527
Why doesn't somebody cut me some slack?

34:42.627 --> 34:44.589
I'm the guy with the tomb of the
unknown terrier in his backyard.

34:44.668 --> 34:45.810
Okay.

34:45.909 --> 34:46.891
Where you going?

34:46.991 --> 34:50.014
I got a singing telegram gig.

34:50.114 --> 34:52.016
Should I meet you at your place later?

34:52.117 --> 34:54.379
Yeah, I'm pretty tired, I think
I'm just gonna do the gig

34:54.478 --> 34:57.382
and crash, but, uh,
I'll call you tomorrow.

34:57.482 --> 34:59.484
Hey.

35:03.208 --> 35:04.149
I'm sorry

35:04.249 --> 35:06.311
about what I said about Clay.

35:06.411 --> 35:07.352
That's not cool.

35:07.452 --> 35:08.833
Yeah.

35:08.933 --> 35:10.935
No, I know you're sorry, Bill.

35:20.345 --> 35:21.566
Hey, Goofus,

35:21.666 --> 35:23.448
where's Gallant?

35:23.548 --> 35:26.611
Hosting an open mic at a
Polish deli in the Valley.

35:26.711 --> 35:27.852
A deli?

35:27.952 --> 35:29.214
Like, where old people eat?

35:29.314 --> 35:30.735
Yeah.

35:30.835 --> 35:32.457
Why is it so gross for them?

35:32.557 --> 35:34.479
Like, old people are cute when
they're shoving five bucks

35:34.559 --> 35:36.661
in your birthday card, but

35:36.761 --> 35:38.183
you ever watch them eat?

35:38.283 --> 35:41.426
I know, it's like swallow, then talk.

35:41.526 --> 35:42.827
Who would perform at a deli?

35:42.927 --> 35:46.231
Cassie. And me, apparently.

35:46.331 --> 35:47.872
Cassie's going up at a deli, huh?

35:47.972 --> 35:50.075
Yeah, at Donimirski's in the Valley.

35:50.175 --> 35:51.336
Eddie set up this open mic thing.

35:51.416 --> 35:53.318
She's going up tonight.

35:53.418 --> 35:56.161
Bill, uh, this my buddy, Melvin.

35:56.261 --> 35:57.362
We were in 'Nam together.

35:57.462 --> 35:58.603
Oh, hey. Bill.

35:58.703 --> 36:00.405
Good to meet ya.

36:00.505 --> 36:02.847
I never met one of Ralph's
'Nam buddies before.

36:02.947 --> 36:04.929
Probably 'cause there
ain't a lot of us left.

36:06.030 --> 36:07.492
Uh, Melvin, this is Edgar.

36:07.592 --> 36:09.534
Edgar, Melvin and I served together.

36:09.634 --> 36:11.216
Oh, really? What restaurant?

36:12.517 --> 36:14.259
Just fucking with you, dude.

36:14.359 --> 36:16.101
You might want to show a little respect.

36:16.201 --> 36:18.343
Man was decorated. Man was a Sergeant.

36:18.443 --> 36:20.064
Uh, it's cool, brother.
It's cool.

36:20.164 --> 36:21.706
Uh, this is what we do.

36:21.806 --> 36:23.208
It's what we do, we
fuck with each other.

36:23.288 --> 36:25.029
It's--it's no disrespect.

36:25.129 --> 36:26.591
Yeah.

36:26.691 --> 36:29.033
Sorry.

36:29.133 --> 36:30.555
It--maybe I just need a drink.

36:30.655 --> 36:32.096
You know what? Let's get you a drink.

36:32.176 --> 36:33.558
Let's all get a drink. Come on.

36:36.180 --> 36:38.042
Hey, Raquel Welch,
let's get some, uh,

36:38.142 --> 36:40.004
get some drinks over here.

36:44.509 --> 36:47.132
- Do you like mine?
- Mm-hmm.

36:47.232 --> 36:49.093
Excuse me. Excuse me.

36:49.193 --> 36:50.855
Um, hey, sorry, uh,

36:50.955 --> 36:53.338
hey, man, I just wanted to
say how great your shit is.

36:53.438 --> 36:56.100
And--and--and good luck
on <i>The Tonight Show.</i>

36:56.200 --> 36:58.703
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah.

36:58.803 --> 37:00.145
I should get back to work.

37:00.245 --> 37:01.506
Ah...

37:03.728 --> 37:06.151
I shouldn't--I'm sorry, I wasn't...

37:06.251 --> 37:08.633
trying to...

37:08.733 --> 37:10.555
You could fuck her.

37:12.377 --> 37:14.919
Yeah, I-I don't--I don't
really get those hot chicks.

37:15.019 --> 37:16.881
I get the--the chicks who look more like

37:16.981 --> 37:19.003
when the Three Stooges
dress up as--as women.

37:19.103 --> 37:21.286
You know?

37:21.386 --> 37:23.368
That's a funny joke, man.

37:23.468 --> 37:25.410
Thanks.

37:25.510 --> 37:28.293
- Thanks.
- You're a comic, right?

37:28.393 --> 37:29.574
Yeah. In theory.

37:29.674 --> 37:30.855
Then you're in.

37:30.955 --> 37:33.097
Look, all funny guys are damaged.

37:33.197 --> 37:37.101
And for some reason, women,
thank God, find that sexy.

37:37.201 --> 37:39.023
And that is their damage.

37:41.366 --> 37:43.147
Right. Right on.

37:43.247 --> 37:44.349
What's your name?

37:44.449 --> 37:45.430
Ron. Ron Shack.

37:45.530 --> 37:47.071
Ron Shack.

37:47.171 --> 37:49.474
What time you going up, Ron Shack?

37:49.574 --> 37:52.477
Uh, watch won't work. You'll
have to use a calendar.

37:52.577 --> 37:54.639
I-I-I just do the open mic.

37:54.739 --> 37:56.881
Oh, that's it, huh? Mondays?

37:56.981 --> 37:58.563
Pretty much, yeah.

37:58.663 --> 38:00.144
Just--it's not a lot of, you
know, not lot of options.

38:00.224 --> 38:01.826
I remember when I was
first starting out,

38:01.906 --> 38:03.888
it was pretty much here
and old folks' homes.

38:03.988 --> 38:07.212
I think that's still the case.

38:07.312 --> 38:09.894
Um, anyway, I'll--I'll--I'll
leave you alone.

38:09.994 --> 38:10.995
But, uh, good luck with
everything, man, seriously--

38:11.075 --> 38:12.977
Hey--hey--hey, hold on.

38:13.077 --> 38:15.740
I got a place you can go up right now.

38:18.843 --> 38:20.865
What do you do?

38:20.965 --> 38:24.068
How else do you handle what's
going on in the world today?

38:24.168 --> 38:27.992
War, riots, economy?

38:28.092 --> 38:29.834
My mom's dead from smoking.

38:29.934 --> 38:33.758
My dad's dead from trying
to pay for her to live.

38:33.858 --> 38:37.322
Alcohol's the only family I had left.

38:37.422 --> 38:39.564
Or at least it was still talking to me.

38:41.746 --> 38:43.388
I just wish I was with
people who understood

38:43.468 --> 38:47.271
what I was talking about.

38:50.835 --> 38:53.578
What the hell are we doing here?

38:53.678 --> 38:55.380
Said you wanted an audience.

38:55.480 --> 38:57.101
I'm not an alcoholic.

38:57.201 --> 38:59.384
- Yeah, don't open with that.
- Op--what?

38:59.484 --> 39:01.346
Hey, everyone, uh, this
is my friend, Ron.

39:01.446 --> 39:03.448
His first time here so
he's a little bit nervous.

39:03.528 --> 39:05.930
What
the hell are you doing?

39:06.010 --> 39:07.432
Get up there, say your name,

39:07.532 --> 39:09.754
you're an alcoholic,
and let 'em have it.

39:09.854 --> 39:12.156
I don't really know you, but
I think I might hate you.

39:12.256 --> 39:14.258
Use that.

39:21.386 --> 39:23.167
Hi, my name is Ron.

39:23.267 --> 39:25.810
Hi, Ron.

39:25.910 --> 39:28.573
And I'm an alcoholic.

39:31.115 --> 39:33.418
Oh. Nice.

39:33.518 --> 39:37.141
You clap before I even start.
That's awesome.

40:01.506 --> 40:03.127
I can't hear you!

40:03.227 --> 40:04.769
All right.

40:04.869 --> 40:06.531
That's what I like to hear.

40:06.631 --> 40:08.813
Okay, this next
comic, he's a writer

40:08.913 --> 40:11.255
on <i>The Sonny and Cher Show.</i>
Huh? Not bad.

40:11.355 --> 40:14.419
And-and, very talented,
a walking argument

40:14.519 --> 40:16.341
against "black is beautiful."

40:16.441 --> 40:18.302
Please, give him a big hand,

40:18.402 --> 40:20.304
Ralph Carnegie, hey!

40:28.693 --> 40:30.114
Holy shit, man.

40:30.214 --> 40:31.756
I still gotta go up.

40:31.856 --> 40:33.758
To Ralph.

40:33.858 --> 40:34.999
- To Ralph, come on.
- To Ralph.

40:35.099 --> 40:36.561
Yeah, okay.

40:36.661 --> 40:38.022
This might come
as a surprise to you,

40:38.102 --> 40:41.606
but I was not a fan of
the Civil Rights Act.

40:41.706 --> 40:44.048
We loved having our own bathroom.

40:45.910 --> 40:48.813
Finally, we have a place
where we know for a fact

40:48.913 --> 40:50.775
no white people would go ever.

40:54.318 --> 40:56.400
The horrors that they must've
thought was going on in there

40:56.481 --> 40:58.663
when all it really was was...

41:06.330 --> 41:08.032
Now, we love that bathroom,

41:08.132 --> 41:10.074
but why did the black drinking fountain

41:10.174 --> 41:12.316
have to be so shitty?

41:13.898 --> 41:16.240
Just have two identical
quality fountains.

41:16.340 --> 41:18.042
One white, one black--

41:18.142 --> 41:19.964
Tell 'em about the gook
that couldn't fly.

41:21.425 --> 41:23.408
Ha, that's-- is that you, Melvin?

41:23.508 --> 41:26.130
It's--it's my boy, Melvin, we
in town, we just having a few.

41:26.230 --> 41:27.732
Tell 'em.

41:27.832 --> 41:28.893
Ha-ha, I'm--I'm a--

41:28.993 --> 41:30.735
Come on, Ralph. Tell 'em, man.

41:30.835 --> 41:32.316
You know, I'm-- I'm
working up here, Melvin.

41:32.396 --> 41:33.738
This is--

41:33.838 --> 41:35.039
Then what the hell you
invite me here for, man?

41:35.119 --> 41:37.021
I wanna hear some motherfucking jokes!

41:37.121 --> 41:39.824
I'm telling jokes if you just
give me an opportunity, Melvin.

41:39.924 --> 41:41.746
- I got a joke.
- I'm-I'm sure you do,

41:41.846 --> 41:43.207
but this is my time, right now, Melvin.

41:43.287 --> 41:45.189
Ralph and I served together in Vietnam.

41:46.410 --> 41:47.752
And we was in this Huey.

41:47.852 --> 41:49.514
And we had lost half our patrol.

41:49.614 --> 41:52.076
And we--we had these two, uh,

41:52.176 --> 41:53.818
two--two gooks, these two gooks,
these Vietnamese soldiers...

41:53.898 --> 41:55.399
Oh, oh, so sorry.

41:55.499 --> 41:56.601
Uh, prisoners...

41:56.701 --> 41:58.282
...slope motherfuckers, and...

41:58.382 --> 41:59.884
...and they was just sitting there.

41:59.984 --> 42:02.687
And one of them just
pulls out a cigarette.

42:02.787 --> 42:04.208
And lights it.

42:04.308 --> 42:05.930
That's enough, Melvin.

42:06.030 --> 42:07.592
Now, now, ten minutes earlier,
this motherfucker put a bullet

42:07.672 --> 42:09.293
in our Master Sergeant's head, but...

42:09.393 --> 42:12.336
...but now, he just sitting
there, just--just puffing away.

42:12.436 --> 42:13.658
Okay, Bill.

42:13.758 --> 42:14.879
Now, Ralph...

42:14.959 --> 42:16.461
Bill! Get this motherfucker!

42:16.561 --> 42:18.623
That didn't sit too well
for--with--with Ralph.

42:18.723 --> 42:20.985
- Come on, man.
- Get off me!

42:21.085 --> 42:22.667
Edgar!

42:24.288 --> 42:26.891
Fuck is everybody... Now, Ralph,

42:26.971 --> 42:29.994
he...

42:31.095 --> 42:33.718
...he grabbed that motherfucker

42:33.818 --> 42:35.840
and he showed him how the door worked,

42:35.940 --> 42:37.942
at 1,000 feet!

42:40.144 --> 42:42.667
Can you imagine that?

42:45.149 --> 42:46.891
Can any of you motherfuckers

42:46.991 --> 42:48.993
imagine that shit?

42:53.878 --> 42:55.620
And you remember what you said, Ralph?

42:57.762 --> 42:58.983
You said,

42:59.083 --> 43:01.506
"Those gook motherfuckers can fight.

43:01.606 --> 43:04.108
But they sure as shit can't fly!"

43:09.694 --> 43:11.696
You remember that, Ralph?

43:13.698 --> 43:15.700
'Cause I remember that shit!

43:18.542 --> 43:20.544
I sure do.

43:30.194 --> 43:31.275
Come on, where are you, Ralph?

43:31.355 --> 43:32.236
- Do you know what you...
- Where are you?

43:32.316 --> 43:33.898
...just fucking did in there?

43:33.998 --> 43:36.140
My life's the truth, man. I
live the truth every day.

43:36.240 --> 43:37.842
You just hiding in
plain sight out there.

43:37.922 --> 43:40.344
The--you think you the only
motherfucker with truth?

43:40.444 --> 43:41.225
That's my truth!

43:41.325 --> 43:42.146
You were there.

43:42.246 --> 43:43.828
And now I'm here!

43:43.928 --> 43:45.389
I ain't there no more! You hear me?

43:45.489 --> 43:46.631
I ain't there no more.

43:46.731 --> 43:49.313
Why aren't you?

43:49.413 --> 43:53.197
Why am I the only one?

43:53.297 --> 43:55.379
There's no man left behind, right?

44:22.887 --> 44:25.349
Yeah, I mean--I mean it's no
wonder I became an alcoholic.

44:25.449 --> 44:27.071
I mean, when I breast-fed, my mother

44:27.171 --> 44:28.512
was so hammered,

44:28.612 --> 44:30.514
her milk was 12 percent
alcohol by volume.

44:33.377 --> 44:34.939
When my old man would run out of beer,

44:35.019 --> 44:36.741
he'd just push me out of
the way and start sucking.

44:38.703 --> 44:40.905
That's a habit that kept up
after the milk dried up too.

44:44.428 --> 44:46.170
Gosh, I gotta say, this has been

44:46.270 --> 44:49.774
so eye-opening being here
tonight with my fellow alchies.

44:49.874 --> 44:51.976
I just feel really
close to all you guys.

44:52.076 --> 44:53.838
You know, wouldn't it be
great if we could all just

44:53.918 --> 44:56.000
fall off the wagon together,
for one night, go get a beer?

44:58.642 --> 45:00.464
Guess that was a joke.

45:00.564 --> 45:02.286
Anyway, that's my time.
You guys have been great.

45:02.366 --> 45:03.988
Thank you.

45:13.057 --> 45:14.939
You really think he threw
that guy from the helicopter?

45:15.019 --> 45:17.201
No. Ralph's a fucking teddy bear.

45:17.301 --> 45:18.883
His friend's fucked up.

45:18.983 --> 45:20.564
Lot of those guys have chips.

45:20.664 --> 45:22.847
War crime's a hell of a
punch line though, huh?

45:22.947 --> 45:24.809
Mm. It's Ralph's business.

45:24.909 --> 45:27.131
We should probably shut
the fuck up about it.

45:27.231 --> 45:29.573
Ralph would never throw
somebody out of a helicopter

45:29.673 --> 45:31.856
unless, you know, there were,
like, snacks involved.

45:36.040 --> 45:39.023
Hey, hey where's the
pride of Wink tonight?

45:39.123 --> 45:40.424
She had a day job.

45:40.524 --> 45:42.326
Then she said she was
gonna go home and relax.

45:42.406 --> 45:44.028
Mm.

45:44.128 --> 45:46.791
She actually is doing a
open mic in Woodland Hills.

45:46.891 --> 45:48.212
What the fuck are you talking about?

45:48.292 --> 45:51.275
Eddie started a open
mic in a Polish deli.

45:51.375 --> 45:52.576
People have been going up there,

45:52.656 --> 45:55.079
and I guess he suckered Cassie in.

46:02.026 --> 46:03.447
Let's go. You're up.

46:03.547 --> 46:07.211
Fluff-and-fold is closed.
Clean your own jizz sheets.

46:07.311 --> 46:08.252
Now.

46:10.474 --> 46:12.937
Come on, baby! Do your job!

46:13.037 --> 46:15.900
Come on!

46:16.000 --> 46:18.783
I'm not leaving till I come!

46:18.883 --> 46:21.946
This member needs to be escorted out.

46:22.046 --> 46:23.708
Escorted? You don't escort no

46:23.808 --> 46:26.470
200-pound angry-ass drunk out.
Where's your bouncer?

46:26.570 --> 46:28.252
We don't have bouncers. We're
an exclusive modeling...

46:28.332 --> 46:30.034
- ...agency.
- Agency?

46:30.134 --> 46:31.735
Jesus, Sonja, we passed three
blowjobs on the way here.

46:31.816 --> 46:33.197
Okay, the jig is up.

46:33.297 --> 46:34.839
Just get him out.

46:34.939 --> 46:38.322
I said I'm not leaving till I come!

46:38.422 --> 46:41.485
Given the... nature of your business,

46:41.585 --> 46:43.647
it's not too much to ask.

46:43.747 --> 46:45.089
Fine.

46:45.189 --> 46:47.531
Have at it.

46:47.631 --> 46:48.532
Fuck.

46:48.632 --> 46:50.494
Look.

46:50.594 --> 46:52.156
I know you come here
to have a good time,

46:52.236 --> 46:53.918
but right now you got enough
scotch in your system

46:53.998 --> 46:55.840
to where you won't even
remember shit, all right?

46:55.920 --> 46:58.102
You have any fucking idea who I am?

46:58.202 --> 46:59.904
Yeah. You're Sam Doak.

47:00.004 --> 47:02.146
Big time agent in CMA.

47:02.246 --> 47:05.309
And I'm Adam Proteau,
a struggling comic.

47:05.409 --> 47:08.672
We--we met after one of
my sets at Goldie's.

47:08.772 --> 47:10.594
So you know who I...

47:10.694 --> 47:12.036
Yeah. Yeah, I know who you are.

47:12.136 --> 47:14.959
And now everybody else here does too.

47:15.059 --> 47:16.600
Look, you come here to not be seen

47:16.700 --> 47:18.763
so won't make too much
sense to make one.

47:18.863 --> 47:20.124
You dig?

47:23.988 --> 47:26.530
Will you give me my trousers, please?

47:26.630 --> 47:28.492
Yeah.

47:33.597 --> 47:36.220
All right, ladies, back to your...

47:36.320 --> 47:39.864
modeling.

47:39.964 --> 47:42.166
<i>I'm seeing a lot of
young faces here tonight.</i>

47:42.246 --> 47:45.269
Uh, personally, I-I
can't wait to get old.

47:45.369 --> 47:47.872
I-I been that way since
I was little too.

47:47.972 --> 47:50.154
Most kids, you know, they
can't wait to turn 18

47:50.254 --> 47:53.277
so they can drink or drive or...
have sex.

47:54.618 --> 47:56.760
Not me. No, I wanted to be 80.

47:56.860 --> 48:00.044
You know, I wanted nothing more
than to sit on my front porch...

48:00.144 --> 48:01.585
...fly undone...

48:01.665 --> 48:03.587
...admiring a box of balls
that kids hit into my yard

48:03.667 --> 48:05.529
that I wasn't planning on giving back.

48:05.629 --> 48:07.631
You know?

48:10.354 --> 48:12.456
So, uh, anyway, 80 is--

48:12.556 --> 48:15.659
Hey, can somebody tell us
what the specials are?

48:15.759 --> 48:18.903
If you just wait a sec, your
waitress will help you.

48:19.003 --> 48:20.945
You're a waitress here, aren't you?

48:21.045 --> 48:22.666
You're sure as fuck not a comedian.

48:22.766 --> 48:24.348
Hey, Bill, don't do this.

48:24.448 --> 48:25.749
Do what?

48:25.849 --> 48:27.711
Do everyone a favor by interrupting

48:27.811 --> 48:30.154
so they don't have to
endure whatever the fuck

48:30.254 --> 48:31.956
this is supposed to be?

48:32.056 --> 48:33.277
That was a good one.

48:33.377 --> 48:35.719
I'm sorry, folks. This is Bill Hobbs.

48:35.819 --> 48:37.321
You might know him from...

48:37.421 --> 48:39.803
actually, why would they know you, Bill?

48:39.903 --> 48:42.486
Stick to the specials. It's
better than your material.

48:42.586 --> 48:43.467
That was like a B-minus.

48:43.547 --> 48:45.549
Hey, can I go up?

48:47.871 --> 48:49.873
Yeah.

48:50.714 --> 48:53.777
Eddie Zeidel,
ladies and gentlemen.

48:53.877 --> 48:55.879
You know, there was a couple
in here the other day.

48:55.960 --> 48:59.183
They'd been together for 53 years.

48:59.283 --> 49:01.545
Which, uh, is pretty sweet.

49:01.645 --> 49:03.307
Maybe. In their case.

49:03.407 --> 49:05.269
But for most of us,

49:05.369 --> 49:07.671
our relationships, I think, are less

49:07.771 --> 49:10.554
lifelong commitments and more

49:10.654 --> 49:12.957
laziness and bad habit.

49:13.057 --> 49:15.639
The telephone of a better life

49:15.739 --> 49:18.002
is just ringing off the hook,

49:18.102 --> 49:22.246
and we're too lazy to get
up and pick up the phone.

49:22.346 --> 49:24.688
Ring!

49:24.788 --> 49:26.770
Hello?

49:26.870 --> 49:28.332
Oh, what,

49:28.432 --> 49:32.897
guy that, uh, wants to actually
take me out on a date?

49:32.997 --> 49:35.619
Like outside-of-the-house date?

49:35.719 --> 49:37.521
Well, I'm gonna have to
get back to you, 'cause

49:37.601 --> 49:40.184
I'm really busy right now
sitting on my comfortable couch

49:40.284 --> 49:42.386
with my lukewarm boyfriend
watching cartoons

49:42.486 --> 49:45.349
in between rounds of ambivalent sex.

49:45.449 --> 49:46.750
Ring!

49:46.850 --> 49:49.914
Hey, guy that thinks I'm hilarious

49:50.014 --> 49:53.117
and isn't threatened by my success.

49:53.217 --> 49:55.159
I would, uh, love to go out with you,

49:55.259 --> 49:57.922
but then I'd have to really
take a good hard look at myself

49:58.022 --> 50:00.564
and why I keep dating people
that make me feel like shit.

50:00.664 --> 50:02.446
Bye.

50:02.546 --> 50:04.368
Ring!

50:04.468 --> 50:05.489
Who could this be?

50:05.589 --> 50:06.810
Hello?

50:08.632 --> 50:11.135
What?

50:11.235 --> 50:14.138
Guy who hears me?

50:14.238 --> 50:16.500
Who really hears me?

50:18.962 --> 50:22.866
Well, I'm just gonna
have to take this call.

50:22.966 --> 50:25.349
Um, can you just hold on for one second?

50:25.449 --> 50:27.591
There's just something that I...

50:27.691 --> 50:30.114
...gotta take care of
before we continue.

50:37.061 --> 50:39.503
Bill, it's over.

50:42.506 --> 50:44.508
Go home.

51:03.967 --> 51:06.710
Well, I think I just invented
open drama mic night.

51:06.810 --> 51:09.153
Hm.

51:09.253 --> 51:12.516
Yeah, well, if anybody had it coming...

51:12.616 --> 51:14.478
There's got to be a reason I keep

51:14.578 --> 51:16.480
sticking my chin out there.

51:18.862 --> 51:23.407
Clay wasn't like that, right?

51:23.507 --> 51:26.370
He was a habit too.

51:26.470 --> 51:29.933
A lovely habit,

51:30.033 --> 51:31.575
but still a habit.

51:33.957 --> 51:35.139
Mm.

51:43.127 --> 51:45.229
We should go on a road trip, man.

51:45.329 --> 51:49.833
Just get in the car and...

51:49.933 --> 51:52.476
Where? Where we gonna go?

51:52.576 --> 51:57.161
Oh, someplace where nobody
knows who the fuck I am.

51:59.983 --> 52:01.445
Fuck.

52:01.545 --> 52:03.567
We don't have to leave
Los Angeles to do that.

52:03.667 --> 52:06.050
We can just park across the street.

52:06.150 --> 52:07.371
Fuck.

52:07.471 --> 52:09.853
Jesus.

52:09.953 --> 52:14.578
I'm getting my ass kicked, Edgar.

52:14.678 --> 52:19.022
I should be used to it by now, but...

52:21.285 --> 52:24.388
You know, man,

52:24.488 --> 52:26.710
you're--you're--you're close.

52:26.810 --> 52:27.871
You're really close.

52:27.971 --> 52:29.153
You just...

52:32.176 --> 52:33.957
You just gotta stop fucking up.

52:34.057 --> 52:36.059
All right?

52:38.101 --> 52:40.444
I had this...

52:40.544 --> 52:42.726
...math teacher.

52:42.826 --> 52:45.369
He said that nothing
ever really touches.

52:45.469 --> 52:46.750
That, like, you could take an object

52:46.830 --> 52:49.573
and cut it infinite times.

52:49.673 --> 52:51.255
It gets closer and closer,

52:51.355 --> 52:54.978
but it never touches.

52:55.078 --> 52:57.661
Maybe that's me.

52:57.761 --> 53:00.824
No matter how close I get to anything,

53:00.924 --> 53:02.926
I'm never gonna touch it.

53:09.693 --> 53:11.995
I told you this is good shit.

53:12.095 --> 53:13.997
- Yeah...
- I gotta take a piss.

53:14.097 --> 53:17.441
Can I just go inside?

53:17.541 --> 53:19.543
Me too.

53:22.105 --> 53:24.888
Hey, man,

53:24.988 --> 53:27.931
maybe you don't have to go inside.

53:31.795 --> 53:33.777
I'm no mathematician,

53:33.877 --> 53:37.020
but I'm pretty sure my piss
is touching Sparky's grave.

53:38.442 --> 53:39.903
And I don't wanna be a buzzkill,

53:40.003 --> 53:41.665
but of all the graves I've pissed on,

53:41.765 --> 53:43.627
this has got to be the least satisfying.

53:43.727 --> 53:47.431
What the fuck are you doing?

53:51.054 --> 53:51.995
Dad.

53:52.095 --> 53:52.956
Dad, please.

53:53.056 --> 53:55.239
Get the fuck away from me!

53:58.422 --> 53:59.523
Dad.

53:59.623 --> 54:01.405
Dad, what are you doing?

54:01.505 --> 54:03.247
You hate me this much?

54:03.347 --> 54:05.329
I don't hate you.

54:05.429 --> 54:08.732
Dad, come on.

54:08.832 --> 54:12.115
You're a sad fucking excuse for a son.

54:13.677 --> 54:14.818
Get your stuff.

54:14.918 --> 54:16.920
We're going.

54:28.011 --> 54:30.954
Are you mad I skipped the
deli for an AA meeting?

54:31.054 --> 54:34.117
Nah. Just wasn't for you.

54:34.217 --> 54:37.321
Hey, listen, I think
what you're doing...

54:37.421 --> 54:39.162
...it's pretty cool.

54:39.262 --> 54:41.124
Thanks.

54:41.224 --> 54:43.847
And I think what you're
doing is fucking nuts.

54:46.109 --> 54:49.453
Or is it?

54:49.553 --> 54:53.657
Ooh. Mm.

54:56.600 --> 54:59.142
So... how's this Nick guy?

54:59.242 --> 55:00.984
I like him.

55:01.084 --> 55:03.667
But...

55:03.767 --> 55:05.229
I don't know.

55:05.329 --> 55:07.671
He doesn't really look at you.

55:07.771 --> 55:09.192
More like he looks through you.

55:09.292 --> 55:10.874
You know what I mean?

55:10.974 --> 55:13.076
Of course.

55:13.176 --> 55:14.197
I'm a waiter.

55:14.297 --> 55:15.499
People look through me every day.

55:17.260 --> 55:20.564
As long as we both end up
in the same place, right?

55:20.664 --> 55:22.246
You know it, pal.

55:22.346 --> 55:26.169
And as long as that place
is not a Polish deli.

55:26.269 --> 55:28.612
Blow me.

55:28.712 --> 55:30.714
Gonna be tricky from that angle.

55:36.840 --> 55:40.504
You, uh, you sure we good, brother?

55:40.604 --> 55:43.827
Fuck yeah. Supposed
to be a little crazy.

55:53.817 --> 55:56.239
You gonna be all right.

55:56.339 --> 55:59.162
You know that, right?

55:59.262 --> 56:01.405
Yes, sir,

56:01.505 --> 56:03.507
Sergeant, sir.

56:18.562 --> 56:20.143
Goldie.

56:20.243 --> 56:24.007
So I had an interesting
conversation with CBS today.

56:25.529 --> 56:27.270
Tell me.

56:27.370 --> 56:29.553
<i>"Girls Are Funny
Too." They're interested.</i>

56:29.653 --> 56:32.235
<i>Freddie wants to hear the formal pitch</i>

56:32.335 --> 56:34.678
<i>from you.</i>

56:34.778 --> 56:36.640
<i>Hello?</i>

56:36.740 --> 56:39.082
Oh, I'm here, I'm just waiting
for the other shoe to drop.

56:39.182 --> 56:42.085
<i>Oh, you're the other shoe, babe.</i>

56:42.185 --> 56:43.587
<i>Turns out I'm not the only one</i>

56:43.667 --> 56:45.288
<i>who wants to get in bed with you.</i>

56:45.388 --> 56:47.250
What about producer?

56:47.350 --> 56:49.813
<i>What about executive producer?</i>

56:49.913 --> 56:51.254
Son of a bitch.

56:52.315 --> 56:53.216
<i>Break a leg.</i>

56:53.316 --> 56:54.978
However many it takes.

56:55.078 --> 56:56.219
<i>Buh-bye now.</i>

57:00.203 --> 57:01.845
That's because I
have to keep lying to you

57:01.925 --> 57:03.767
and telling you you're
talented and good-looking.

57:03.847 --> 57:05.429
All right, all right, I get it.

57:05.529 --> 57:07.551
Not anymore you aren't.

57:07.651 --> 57:09.673
- Funny joke, Ralph.
- Thanks, man.

57:40.684 --> 57:42.065
<i>Mr. Beverly?</i>

57:42.165 --> 57:43.346
<i>It's time.</i>

57:47.330 --> 57:49.152
<i>Mr. Beverly?</i>

57:49.252 --> 57:52.315
<i>We're coming back from
commercial in five.</i>

57:52.415 --> 57:54.918
<i>Mr. Beverly?</i>
