[BO narrating]
Previously on Lost Girl:

00:07.258 --> 00:07.883
[BO] Couldn't help
but notice you didn't

00:08.092 --> 00:09.457
let her in on your
little situation.

00:09.677 --> 00:10.792
[EVONY] Why didn't
you turn me Fae

00:11.012 --> 00:12.001
when you had the chance?

00:12.221 --> 00:13.722
Because I wanted
to test the serum.

00:13.931 --> 00:14.386
On who?

00:14.599 --> 00:16.214
[TRICK] The last time
Hades was vulnerable

00:16.434 --> 00:18.800
was when he was
banished to Tartarus.

00:19.020 --> 00:20.556
The door to Valhalla
only opens

00:20.771 --> 00:22.022
in the presence
of teachers.

00:22.231 --> 00:24.347
[FREYJA] Please welcome
Mistress Acacia.

00:24.567 --> 00:25.602
[clapping]

00:25.818 --> 00:26.898
He wants to
build an army.

00:27.111 --> 00:29.693
Then be his perfect
little general.

00:29.906 --> 00:30.895
[TAMSIN] If you try
to go after my friends,

00:31.115 --> 00:32.571
just know you'll have to
go through me first.

00:32.783 --> 00:34.068
What if he's playing
the same game?

00:34.285 --> 00:36.071
There's only
one way to find out.

00:36.370 --> 00:46.371
[electropop music plays]

01:07.443 --> 01:09.058
Is this really happening?

01:09.278 --> 01:16.366
[music continues]

01:16.577 --> 01:18.033
[LAUREN] l'm starving.
Does chi-sucking

01:18.246 --> 01:20.032
always give a bad case
of the munchies?

01:20.248 --> 01:21.488
[BO] Heh.

01:21.707 --> 01:22.742
You want pizza?

01:22.959 --> 01:24.824
You called for pizza
half an hour ago.

01:25.044 --> 01:25.794
You don't remember?

01:26.003 --> 01:27.038
Of course I do.

01:27.255 --> 01:28.370
l was kidding.

01:28.589 --> 01:30.921
Oh. Well, "ha" then.

01:31.133 --> 01:33.670
Oh what? You don't think
l have a future in stand-up?

01:33.886 --> 01:35.672
[BO] Well I wouldn't
put it past you.

01:35.888 --> 01:37.469
I mean, I never
imagined you'd be Fae.

01:37.682 --> 01:39.422
Not Fae. Not quite.

01:39.642 --> 01:40.802
Not unless
I'm touching one.

01:41.018 --> 01:43.009
Well, what happens if
you hold on for too long?

01:43.229 --> 01:45.311
| explode into confetti.

01:45.523 --> 01:46.854
It's actually
quite spectacular.

01:47.066 --> 01:48.146
Do you wanna see?

01:48.359 --> 01:49.439
[LAUREN] But your
question is valid.

01:49.652 --> 01:51.734
I will conduct some tests.

01:51.946 --> 01:52.856
[BO] On yourself?

01:53.072 --> 01:54.437
I mean, isn't that
what guinea pigs are for?

01:54.657 --> 01:55.942
I am taking
every precaution.

01:56.158 --> 01:57.489
Yeah, and I'm
every bit worried.

01:57.702 --> 01:59.067
[LAUREN] Well don't be.

01:59.287 --> 02:01.403
Once we discovered
the TTV I knew that--

02:01.622 --> 02:03.999
We? You said "we."

02:04.208 --> 02:07.700
Once we discovered
TGIF or whatever.

02:07.920 --> 02:09.581
Okay, look.

02:10.673 --> 02:12.538
Jack helped me
solve my equation.

02:12.758 --> 02:14.294
[LAUREN] And I would've
solved it myself,

02:14.510 --> 02:16.125
but he just helped me
get there a little sooner.

02:16.345 --> 02:19.132
Lauren, he is
planning something.

02:19.348 --> 02:19.882
What if this
is part of it?

02:20.099 --> 02:21.760
ThenlWlbe
one step ahead.

02:21.976 --> 02:23.056
[LAUREN]
Bo, look. Look, I know.

02:23.269 --> 02:25.100
I know that this is
overwhelming for you.

02:25.313 --> 02:27.804
But this is a step in
the right direction, Bo.

02:28.024 --> 02:28.979
The forever direction...

02:29.191 --> 02:31.227
You can't trust him.

02:31.444 --> 02:34.936
It feels like the issue here
is that you don't trust me.

02:35.156 --> 02:37.488
[knock on the door]

02:37.700 --> 02:39.861
That would be the pizza.

02:44.081 --> 02:48.620
[clanging]

02:55.092 --> 02:56.252
Don't fail me.

02:56.469 --> 02:58.084
[MAN] Sundown. Tomorrow.

02:58.304 --> 03:00.010
It will be done.

03:05.227 --> 03:07.639
[elevator dings, doors open]

03:10.983 --> 03:13.190
Elizabeth?

03:13.402 --> 03:14.608
Is that really you?

03:14.820 --> 03:16.196
Not again...

03:16.405 --> 03:18.942
So, are you a screamer?

03:19.158 --> 03:21.740
Or are you the type that's
gonna get all emotional?

03:21.952 --> 03:23.078
I thought you were dead.

03:23.287 --> 03:25.027
No.

03:25.373 --> 03:26.829
[neck breaking]

03:27.041 --> 03:28.577
[ZEE] That's you.

03:30.419 --> 03:35.413
[opening theme]

03:50.356 --> 03:56.943
[phone ringing]

03:57.154 --> 03:58.564
[beep]

03:59.698 --> 04:01.404
Dyson...

04:01.617 --> 04:04.950
[DYSON] Where?
Okay... I'm on my way.

04:05.371 --> 04:06.907
Work. Something's come up.

04:07.123 --> 04:08.454
Do you want your coffee to go?

04:08.666 --> 04:10.622
No, I'll take it
like this, thanks.

04:10.835 --> 04:11.745
I'll see you tonight?

04:11.961 --> 04:13.371
I'll be here.

04:16.715 --> 04:18.455
Dyson .

04:21.220 --> 04:22.050
Your wallet.

04:22.263 --> 04:24.049
Thank you. I'm an idiot.

04:27.726 --> 04:29.387
[DYSON]
Sorry about that.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.935
No, it's my fault.

04:32.148 --> 04:33.763
We'll talk later.

04:33.983 --> 04:35.689
[ALICIA] I'll be here.

04:43.242 --> 04:45.028
[BO] That's Zee all right.

04:45.244 --> 04:46.108
[TRICK] Any witnesses?

04:46.328 --> 04:47.238
None that saw
the incident.

04:47.455 --> 04:48.319
I don't get it,
I was there.

04:48.539 --> 04:50.120
I saw Zee vanish
with the painting.

04:50.332 --> 04:51.538
Just like Jack
said she would.

04:51.750 --> 04:53.286
Well, there's
your answer.

04:53.502 --> 04:54.878
Jack lied to me.

04:55.087 --> 04:57.578
Yeah it looks like Hades
and Zeus are in cahoots.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.754
Brothers in arms,
together again.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.673
[BO] I need to go
see him. I need answers.

05:01.886 --> 05:02.750
You don't think he's
just gonna lie again?

05:02.970 --> 05:04.380
Oh I'm pretty sure he will.

05:04.597 --> 05:05.586
Which is why
I'll play ignorant

05:05.806 --> 05:07.091
to the fact
that Zee is back.

05:07.308 --> 05:08.844
Oh. The old, he can't
know that you know,

05:09.059 --> 05:10.515
'cause if he knows
you know, he'll know.

05:10.728 --> 05:13.845
Yeah. You know.

05:14.064 --> 05:15.895
Why was Zee
at the courthouse?

05:16.108 --> 05:17.018
It's ground zero.

05:17.234 --> 05:18.644
The elevator crash
is where it all started.

05:18.861 --> 05:20.021
It's where Zee,
Hera, and Iris first

05:20.237 --> 05:21.397
possessed their human bodies.

05:21.614 --> 05:22.854
I have a feeling
that courthouse is

05:23.073 --> 05:24.483
sitting on something big.

05:24.700 --> 05:25.860
Lucky courthouse.

05:26.076 --> 05:28.283
[snorts, clears throat]

05:28.496 --> 05:30.236
I swear that was
my inside voice.

05:30.456 --> 05:33.243
I'll dig up any archaeological
history I can find.

05:33.459 --> 05:36.542
First stop: Old Man Liar.

05:41.175 --> 05:41.960
[LAUREN exhales]

05:42.176 --> 05:43.712
Patient's response
to pain stimulus

05:43.928 --> 05:45.509
is still nonexistent.

05:45.721 --> 05:47.586
[LAUREN] No verbal
or motor response.

05:47.806 --> 05:49.216
You can go ahead
and change his fluids

05:49.433 --> 05:50.889
and I'd like
another CT scan.

05:51.101 --> 05:54.719
Oh, by the way where are
Patient X's test results?

05:54.939 --> 05:57.976
Aren't those them
in your hand?

05:58.192 --> 06:00.023
[chuckles]

06:00.236 --> 06:01.851
Indeed they are. Thanks.

06:02.071 --> 06:03.607
Carry on.

06:06.450 --> 06:08.236
Early stage Parkinson's?

06:08.452 --> 06:10.192
And the patient's
cognitive decline

06:10.412 --> 06:11.948
is still increasing rapidly,

06:12.164 --> 06:14.075
it's not looking good.

06:14.291 --> 06:16.782
No. No it isn't.

06:17.002 --> 06:19.254
Who is Patient X anyway?

06:19.463 --> 06:21.294
[LAUREN] No one.

06:24.510 --> 06:26.592
Bo, if this is
about last night

06:26.804 --> 06:27.884
I am not in the mood.

06:28.097 --> 06:29.212
I'm here to question Jack.

06:29.431 --> 06:31.262
Oh, when you need
his help it's okay,

06:31.475 --> 06:32.305
but when I do--

06:32.518 --> 06:33.507
This is different.

06:33.727 --> 06:34.716
Oh yeah, how?

06:34.937 --> 06:36.893
Because we're
talking about you.

06:37.106 --> 06:39.017
The woman that I love.

06:39.233 --> 06:41.724
[BO] How can someone
so smart be so...

06:41.944 --> 06:42.729
[sighs]

06:42.945 --> 06:46.278
Look, I'm sorry, Lauren.
I didn't mean that--

06:46.490 --> 06:48.731
[BO] I just don't get
why you're so willing

06:50.995 --> 06:52.610
No, I guess you don't.

06:52.830 --> 06:55.788
Lauren, please,
let's talk about this.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.286
[LAUREN] Bo, what else
is there to say?

07:03.173 --> 07:04.583
[sighs]

07:05.634 --> 07:07.135
[JACK] I only brought
the horse to the water.

07:07.344 --> 07:09.960
I had no part
in making her drink.

07:10.180 --> 07:11.169
Horseshit.

07:11.390 --> 07:12.675
[JACK] I admit I helped
her with the solution,

07:12.891 --> 07:16.884
but I had no idea she was
going to use it on herself.

07:17.104 --> 07:18.935
You're messing with
someone's life.

07:19.148 --> 07:22.140
She wanted this more than
anything in the world.

07:27.823 --> 07:29.779
What about Zee?

07:29.992 --> 07:31.232
You haven't
asked me about her.

07:31.452 --> 07:32.237
Why'd you lie to me?

07:32.453 --> 07:34.444
I told you the painting
would vanish Zee,

07:34.663 --> 07:35.823
I never said to where.

07:36.040 --> 07:37.029
So you played me.

07:37.249 --> 07:38.785
[JACK] I protected you.

07:39.001 --> 07:40.036
From what?

07:40.252 --> 07:41.367
I manipulated the
painting in case

07:41.587 --> 07:43.828
it got into
the wrong hands.

07:44.048 --> 07:47.791
I couldn't risk Zee
using it on you.

07:48.010 --> 07:49.875
[distant crashing]

07:51.764 --> 07:54.050
Don't look at me.

07:57.978 --> 08:01.971
[gasping]

08:05.319 --> 08:06.900
[gasps, breathes heavily]

08:07.112 --> 08:08.192
[BO] Oh, so now
you're going to play

08:08.405 --> 08:09.941
the frightened
little kitten, huh?

08:10.157 --> 08:10.737
The last time I checked,

08:10.949 --> 08:11.938
you were all about
the catfight.

08:12.159 --> 08:13.365
Where am I? Who are you?

08:13.577 --> 08:15.192
Oh, cut the crap, Zee.
What are you doing here?

08:15.412 --> 08:17.152
I don't know...

08:17.373 --> 08:19.113
[WOMAN] I don't know.

08:21.835 --> 08:22.824
Elizabeth?

08:36.725 --> 08:38.386
[TAMSIN]
And I thought I could eat.

08:38.602 --> 08:42.015
Feeding off adoration must not
satisfy the human appetite.

08:42.231 --> 08:43.516
Are you sure
this isn't a scheme?

08:43.732 --> 08:45.438
That Zee
is still in her?

08:45.651 --> 08:47.607
Hundy-p.

08:48.904 --> 08:50.440
Um... apparently
I've been hanging out

08:50.656 --> 08:51.611
with my son too much.

08:51.824 --> 08:53.405
No, there's no scent
of Fae in there.

08:53.617 --> 08:54.823
It's all... human.

08:55.035 --> 08:57.447
Well Zee must have
gone somewhere.

08:57.663 --> 08:59.949
Maybe Elizabeth
can help us find her.

09:05.045 --> 09:07.832
Elizabeth.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.584
We need your help.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.131
[30}
What do you remember...

09:11.343 --> 09:13.425
when... Zee...?

09:13.637 --> 09:14.968
Hijacked my body?

09:15.180 --> 09:16.761
[BO] Yeah.

09:16.974 --> 09:18.589
[ELIZABETH] I tried to
block most of it out.

09:18.809 --> 09:19.844
My eyes were shut like

09:20.060 --> 09:21.675
ninety-seven percent
of the time.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.556
[ELIZABETH] And I would do
this thing where I would

09:23.772 --> 09:25.512
just like,
hum old Madonna songs.

09:25.733 --> 09:27.564
And it would be
my happy place.

09:27.776 --> 09:30.017
And I would think about
my fiancé, David.

09:30.237 --> 09:32.068
And I would just--

09:32.865 --> 09:35.527
[ELIZABETH] Oh gosh.

09:35.743 --> 09:40.407
I... she...

09:42.666 --> 09:44.167
...killed him, didn't I?

09:44.376 --> 09:47.118
Look, Zee can't
hurt you anymore.

09:47.337 --> 09:48.998
But we need to figure out
what she was doing

09:49.214 --> 09:50.249
in that courthouse
so she doesn't

09:50.466 --> 09:51.251
hurt anyone else.

09:51.467 --> 09:52.957
I can't.

09:53.177 --> 09:55.213
Maybe this will
help you remember.

09:55.429 --> 09:57.135
[ELIZABETH] That's Claire.

09:57.347 --> 09:58.302
Did I do that?

09:58.515 --> 10:00.016
No, not you, Zee.

10:00.225 --> 10:01.260
Oh gosh, oh gosh,
oh gosh, oh gosh,

10:01.477 --> 10:03.388
oh gosh, oh gosh,
oh gosh, oh gosh.

10:03.604 --> 10:04.810
How many people did I kill?

10:05.022 --> 10:08.059
Okay, what happened
to you is horrible.

10:08.275 --> 10:09.185
There's no denying that.

10:09.401 --> 10:11.813
It sucks to be
used against your will.

10:12.029 --> 10:13.485
But it's time to be
a hero, not a victim.

10:13.697 --> 10:14.482
So, maybe you
should stop crying

10:14.698 --> 10:16.734
and start remembering.

10:16.950 --> 10:17.609
[ELIZABETH exhales deeply]

10:17.826 --> 10:19.032
What? Tough love.

10:19.244 --> 10:21.656
[ELIZABETH]
Uh, okay... umm...

10:21.872 --> 10:22.657
[sniffs]

10:22.873 --> 10:25.114
I remember, um...

10:25.334 --> 10:26.870
a smell.

10:27.085 --> 10:30.373
[ELIZABETH] And it
was musty. And it was hot.

10:30.589 --> 10:33.376
Not Florida hot.
Like, fire in my face hot.

10:33.592 --> 10:34.627
Okay, that's
really great, Beth.

10:34.843 --> 10:36.379
--[EL|ZABETH] And...
--[BO] What else?

10:36.595 --> 10:37.459
Banging.

10:37.679 --> 10:39.510
Like someone
hammering on a furnace.

10:39.723 --> 10:43.341
And I think... there was
something about,

10:43.560 --> 10:46.973
[ELIZABETH]
like, a... a shield?

10:47.189 --> 10:49.305
I think she was
giving it to someone.

10:49.525 --> 10:51.516
[TRICK] The Aegis Shield.

10:56.365 --> 10:59.448
[TRICK] This is
Hephaestus. Or Hepha.

10:59.660 --> 11:01.275
I think I just
Hepha'd my lunch.

11:01.495 --> 11:03.531
He's the son of
Zeus and Hera.

11:03.747 --> 11:05.248
[TRICK] He's the forger
of weaponry and armor

11:05.457 --> 11:06.788
for the Ancients.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.456
But why would Zee
relinquish her shield?

11:08.669 --> 11:10.580
It was her protection.

11:10.796 --> 11:13.663
Hephaestus only grants
one weapon per god.

11:16.635 --> 11:17.920
More deadly.

11:18.136 --> 11:18.966
We need to get
into that courthouse

11:19.179 --> 11:20.168
and find the elephant man.

11:20.389 --> 11:21.879
[TRICK] It's not
gonna be that easy.

11:22.099 --> 11:23.964
In order to meet
with Hephaestus,

11:24.184 --> 11:25.845
one must be
granted an audience

11:26.061 --> 11:27.176
with one of the Erinyes.

11:27.396 --> 11:30.604
The Ministers of
Justice. Uh, Tisiphone,

11:30.816 --> 11:31.805
Megaera, and--

11:32.025 --> 11:33.765
Not Judge Megaera.

11:33.986 --> 11:34.975
[DYSON] You know him?

11:35.195 --> 11:36.526
Her.

11:36.738 --> 11:37.989
Everyone knows her.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.233
Well what's she like?

11:39.449 --> 11:41.576
I don't use the Lord's
name in vain often,

11:41.785 --> 11:44.948
but she is one mean
son of a you know what.

11:45.163 --> 11:47.700
You didn't use the
Lord's name in vain.

11:47.916 --> 11:49.326
Exactly.

11:54.256 --> 11:55.245
[LAUREN'S VOICEMAIL] Leave a
message after the tone.

11:55.465 --> 11:56.591
Hey, it's me, again.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.085
Look, I know you said
you needed some time,

11:58.302 --> 11:59.382
but five more
minutes and I think

11:59.595 --> 12:02.007
I might explode
into confetti.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.177
Lauren, I am sorry.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.802
Please call me back.

12:06.018 --> 12:07.724
Makes me glad I'm single.

12:07.936 --> 12:09.142
Oh, I'm sorry.

12:09.354 --> 12:10.639
That was so insensitive of
me to do in front of you.

12:10.856 --> 12:12.221
No, it's all good.

12:12.441 --> 12:14.306
I'm very happy for
you and the Doc.

12:14.526 --> 12:15.060
ReaHy?

12:15.277 --> 12:16.733
Hundy-p.

12:16.945 --> 12:17.604
We're friends.

12:17.821 --> 12:19.607
Just, not friends
with benefits.

12:19.823 --> 12:21.029
[ELIZABETH]
One, two, check.

12:21.241 --> 12:22.697
Check, check. Testing.

12:22.910 --> 12:24.275
One, two, three--

12:24.494 --> 12:26.780
[BO] We hear you,
loud and clear, Beth.

12:26.997 --> 12:27.782
Do you hear us?

12:27.998 --> 12:28.908
[ELIZABETH] I sure do.

12:29.124 --> 12:31.080
This is like so
Mission Impossible, like--

12:31.293 --> 12:32.908
Beth, focus.

12:33.128 --> 12:33.628
[ELIZABETH] Oh, okay.

12:33.837 --> 12:36.169
Yes, Megaera is elegant.

12:36.381 --> 12:39.544
She's like, like an older
Kate Winslet in Titanic.

12:39.760 --> 12:40.966
[ELIZABETH] Oh, and you
can always count on

12:41.178 --> 12:42.258
a statement necklace.

12:42.471 --> 12:43.836
Be more specific, Beth.

12:44.056 --> 12:45.341
[ELIZABETH] She likes to
eat her lunch under that

12:45.557 --> 12:48.344
super weird, super
offensive painting.

12:48.560 --> 12:49.845
Do you see her?

12:50.938 --> 12:52.269
Egg salad on rye.

12:52.481 --> 12:53.436
[ELIZABETH]
When you approach,

12:53.649 --> 12:55.389
be sure to use
short sentences.

12:55.609 --> 12:57.770
And, she is a sucker
for legalese.

12:57.986 --> 13:00.193
So like, use lawyerly
speak whenever you can.

13:00.405 --> 13:02.236
I object!

13:02.449 --> 13:04.189
No really.
That is all I got.

13:04.409 --> 13:05.945
[ELIZABETH] Maybe we
should Roxanne this.

13:06.161 --> 13:08.197
Ugh...! If she makes
one more movie reference,

13:08.413 --> 13:09.448
I am cutting her off.

13:09.665 --> 13:10.905
Roxanne is a movie?

13:11.124 --> 13:12.330
[ELIZABETH]
Come on, Steve Martin,

13:12.542 --> 13:14.999
Daryl Hannah.
Cyrano de Bergerac!

13:15.212 --> 13:16.668
Hello. I'm--

13:16.880 --> 13:17.835
No.

13:18.048 --> 13:20.790
No?

13:21.009 --> 13:22.715
You don't just waltz
over here, Miss Dennis,

13:22.928 --> 13:24.589
interrupt my lunch,

13:24.805 --> 13:26.420
and ask for an audience
with Hephaestus.

13:26.640 --> 13:28.301
No of course not.

13:28.517 --> 13:29.632
[30}
Egg sandwhich looks good.

13:29.851 --> 13:31.261
Smells good too.

13:38.485 --> 13:41.852
[M EGAERA sighs]

13:42.072 --> 13:43.152
Okay.

13:43.365 --> 13:47.529
An audience is given only
by proving oneself worthy.

13:47.744 --> 13:48.779
What are we talkin'?

13:48.996 --> 13:51.612
Slaying a dragon?
Swallowing a centipede?

13:54.042 --> 13:55.657
Was that there before?

14:00.090 --> 14:01.830
You and only you
can enter.

14:02.050 --> 14:03.460
[TAMSIN] Okay.

14:05.470 --> 14:07.256
Your test awaits you.

14:07.472 --> 14:10.134
Will I get
any time to study?

14:12.936 --> 14:14.551
I'm here if you need me.

14:42.090 --> 14:46.208
[MAN] Ah great,
this is just what I needed.

14:46.428 --> 14:48.089
Uh... Need what now?

14:48.305 --> 14:51.138
I really hope you're better
than the last three lawyers.

14:53.351 --> 14:54.636
This business is my life.

14:54.853 --> 14:56.434
Please don't
screw it up for me.

14:56.646 --> 14:59.228
I'm Philip.

14:59.441 --> 15:02.558
Will you excuse me
just one moment?

15:05.614 --> 15:08.572
Um. I think there's been
some kind of mistake,

15:08.784 --> 15:10.365
because I'm not a lawyer.

15:12.079 --> 15:14.035
Succeed for your client

15:14.247 --> 15:16.203
and you will be
granted an audience.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.998
Fail, and the only thing
you'll be granted

15:19.211 --> 15:21.702
is a one way ticket to Myth.

15:21.922 --> 15:25.085
Please tell me that's
an island in Greece.

15:26.885 --> 15:31.720
Myth is a realm
of eternal stasis.

15:31.932 --> 15:33.843
Limbo, if you will.

15:34.059 --> 15:36.266
Well...
can't a girl cut a deal?

15:37.687 --> 15:39.814
[MEGAERA]
Take your seat.

15:41.525 --> 15:43.891
Court is in session.

15:52.744 --> 15:55.907
Hey Roxanne, you're on.

16:01.962 --> 16:04.294
[PHILIP] Max and I started
Tech Talk from the ground up.

16:04.506 --> 16:06.872
And he stole a
software application

16:07.092 --> 16:09.253
and sold it to our
top competitor.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.209
[ELIZABETH]
And so, under |.P. rights

16:11.429 --> 16:12.930
he had no authority to sell.

16:13.140 --> 16:15.756
And so, under P.|. rights--

16:15.976 --> 16:18.638
[ELIZABETH] |.P.!
Intellectual property.

16:18.854 --> 16:22.221
Excuse me,
under |.P. rights,

16:22.440 --> 16:23.771
Max had no right to sell

16:23.984 --> 16:26.316
because it was never his
to sell in the first place.

16:26.528 --> 16:28.814
Exactly. He did invent it.

16:29.030 --> 16:31.021
But he used company
assets to do so.

16:31.241 --> 16:32.777
Great, Bo.
You're doing great.

16:32.993 --> 16:34.858
Thank you.

16:35.078 --> 16:36.659
The prosecution rests.

16:36.872 --> 16:38.863
Your honor!
Don't forget your honor.

16:39.082 --> 16:41.073
The prosecution rests,

16:41.293 --> 16:42.703
your honor.

16:45.088 --> 16:47.921
Your witness.

16:48.133 --> 16:49.373
Thank you, your honor.

16:49.593 --> 16:53.006
I only have two
questions for the witness.

16:55.223 --> 16:59.262
Is that your signature?

16:59.477 --> 17:00.466
Yes, it is.

17:00.687 --> 17:02.097
[LAWYER] And what does
the document pertain to?

17:02.314 --> 17:04.646
This is Max's
proposal for the app.

17:04.858 --> 17:06.223
[PHILIP] Which I rejected.

17:06.443 --> 17:09.401
And if you rejected
the proposal

17:09.613 --> 17:12.275
[LAWYER] then wouldn't
Max be free to

17:12.490 --> 17:12.899
take it somewhere else?

17:13.116 --> 17:16.358
Objection!

17:16.578 --> 17:18.193
That was
three questions.

17:20.207 --> 17:21.617
Overruled.

17:22.250 --> 17:24.662
[PHILIP] Uh...

17:24.878 --> 17:29.747
No, actually. Max signed a
confidentiality contract.

17:29.966 --> 17:31.502
The only reason I rejected
that proposal is because

17:31.718 --> 17:33.709
he was trying to
cut me out entirely.

17:33.929 --> 17:35.510
[PHILIP] I thought we're
supposed to be partners.

17:35.722 --> 17:40.011
If you're "partners,"
then why is Max

17:40.227 --> 17:43.845
not in any of these
publicity documents?

17:44.856 --> 17:46.232
[PHILIP] Is that what
this is all about?

17:46.441 --> 17:48.397
These are business
publications.

17:48.610 --> 17:51.352
W-Why would you
ever be included?

17:52.614 --> 17:55.321
[LAWYER] Doesn't sound like
a partnership to me.

17:55.533 --> 17:57.398
No more questions
your honor.

17:58.828 --> 18:00.443
I am no expert,

18:00.664 --> 18:03.747
but I'm thinking that
was not good for us.

18:05.001 --> 18:08.368
No not good at all. No.

18:08.588 --> 18:11.375
You okay?
You seem distracted.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.923
Yeah, you could say that.

18:14.135 --> 18:15.966
Is it Mark?

18:18.223 --> 18:19.963
The human?

18:21.768 --> 18:22.928
I thought you claimed her.

18:23.144 --> 18:24.884
What's the issue?

18:27.524 --> 18:29.640
Dyson, are you in...?

18:29.859 --> 18:32.396
No, no...

18:32.612 --> 18:35.319
Bo will always be
your greatest love.

18:35.532 --> 18:36.863
But that doesn't mean
there isn't room

18:37.075 --> 18:38.315
for you to love another.

18:38.535 --> 18:40.696
That's not the way
of my kind.

18:40.912 --> 18:42.322
There are rules.

18:42.539 --> 18:43.824
[TRICK]
For thousands of years,

18:44.040 --> 18:46.156
I lived by the rules of
the Light and the Dark.

18:46.376 --> 18:48.992
It's because of that
steadfast resolution

18:49.212 --> 18:51.828
that I tore my family apart.

18:52.674 --> 18:55.791
Sometimes, the heart
does what it likes.

18:56.011 --> 18:58.252
Despite what the rules say.

19:05.353 --> 19:08.641
[fire alarm beeping]

19:08.857 --> 19:10.267
Alicia?!

19:10.483 --> 19:12.098
Alicia!

19:12.319 --> 19:13.729
[DYSON] Alicia?

19:16.114 --> 19:18.070
[ALICIA and DYSON cough]

19:18.283 --> 19:20.114
[ALICIA] Yeah, I uh...

19:20.327 --> 19:21.316
I made dinner.

19:21.536 --> 19:23.276
[DYSON] Mhm. Yeah.

19:23.496 --> 19:24.827
I could smell it
from around the block.

19:25.040 --> 19:27.122
It's a... Whoo!

19:27.334 --> 19:28.619
Yup, roast chicken.

19:28.835 --> 19:29.665
[ALICIA]
It was at one point.

19:29.878 --> 19:31.084
I mean, now it's just sad.

19:31.296 --> 19:32.536
--[DYSON] No, no, no.
--[AL|C|A] I'm such an idiot.

19:32.756 --> 19:33.836
[DYSON] No, not at all.

19:34.049 --> 19:35.789
It's the thought that counts.

19:36.009 --> 19:37.545
Well done.

19:37.761 --> 19:38.591
[coughs]

19:38.803 --> 19:42.216
So, umm, how 'bout we
order in, huh?

19:42.432 --> 19:43.262
Good idea.

19:43.475 --> 19:45.215
[DYSON] You liked that
Thai place right?

19:49.481 --> 19:51.096
[DYSON] Wait.

19:53.068 --> 19:55.229
Shouldn't we talk about this?

19:57.155 --> 19:59.237
No.

20:00.116 --> 20:10.117
:2

20:20.220 --> 20:21.255
[ELIZABETH]
Trust me when I tell you

20:21.471 --> 20:22.802
that we have this
in the bag.

20:23.014 --> 20:25.596
The law is the law
is the law is the--

20:25.809 --> 20:26.924
The law, we get it.

20:27.143 --> 20:29.304
I pitched the idea
to Philip several times.

20:29.521 --> 20:31.603
[LAWYER]
So you in no way tried to

20:31.815 --> 20:34.101
exclude Philip
from the process?

20:34.317 --> 20:36.558
I wanted this app to
be part of Tech Talk,

20:36.778 --> 20:38.268
the company I put
years of hard work

20:38.488 --> 20:41.696
into making...
the success it is today.

20:41.908 --> 20:43.819
[LAWYER] Thank you.

20:44.035 --> 20:46.026
No further questions,
your honor.

20:46.246 --> 20:48.783
Your witness, Miss Dennis.

20:51.876 --> 20:55.289
[BO] Mr. Pearson,

20:55.505 --> 20:57.666
did you steal
Tech Talk's property

20:57.882 --> 20:59.213
and sell it
to Brebner Tech?

20:59.426 --> 21:01.838
Property? No.
It was my idea.

21:02.053 --> 21:03.964
But was it
yours to sell?

21:04.180 --> 21:05.920
[MAX] Y-Yes.
I mean, of course, yes.

21:06.141 --> 21:07.881
I own half the company.

21:08.101 --> 21:09.307
Why can't I do what
I want with an idea

21:09.519 --> 21:11.305
[MAX]
that's not being valued?

21:11.521 --> 21:13.682
Because it's
against the law, Max.

21:13.898 --> 21:16.389
Because--

21:16.609 --> 21:18.019
Bo? Look, can you hear me?

21:18.236 --> 21:19.601
Just say that
he broke the law.

21:19.821 --> 21:20.651
[ELIZABETH]
He signed a contract.

21:20.864 --> 21:22.820
It's black and white--

21:29.038 --> 21:30.073
No.

21:30.290 --> 21:32.155
No, what, Miss Dennis?

21:32.375 --> 21:39.167
No... one ever noticed you.

21:39.382 --> 21:41.168
[B0] The law isn't
what matters here.

21:41.384 --> 21:42.419
You feel like

21:42.635 --> 21:45.126
Philip doesn't
value you, but he does.

21:45.346 --> 21:48.053
You guys are like two
sides of the same coin.

21:48.266 --> 21:52.384
But maybe Philip feels like
you might not need him.

21:52.604 --> 21:54.094
There's a difference
between working together

21:54.314 --> 21:55.895
and him takin' over.

21:56.107 --> 21:57.483
That was never
my intention.

21:57.692 --> 21:59.193
[BO] No, you were just
trying to protect him,

21:59.402 --> 22:00.608
right, Philip?

22:00.820 --> 22:02.435
I didn't want him to
get taken advantage of.

22:02.655 --> 22:03.735
[PHILIP] I was afraid
you'd lose everything.

22:03.948 --> 22:06.439
I figured if I kept you close,
I could protect you...

22:06.659 --> 22:09.526
Nobody made it
your job to protect me.

22:12.874 --> 22:14.705
Yeah--|-|'m gonna
drop the suit.

22:14.918 --> 22:16.829
[PHILIP] Yeah.

22:17.045 --> 22:18.410
If you want to sell,
you go ahead.

22:18.630 --> 22:19.961
[PHILIP]
But if you want to stay,

22:20.173 --> 22:22.209
we'll try to make it work.

22:22.425 --> 22:25.258
Yeah, yeah I want to stay.

22:26.679 --> 22:27.338
Okay.

22:27.555 --> 22:28.965
[gavel bangs]

22:29.182 --> 22:31.093
Case dismissed.

22:37.398 --> 22:40.686
Wait... that's it?

22:40.902 --> 22:42.108
I mean I know I didn't win,

22:42.320 --> 22:43.981
but they worked it
out in the end. And...

22:44.197 --> 22:47.064
doesn't that make us all
winners at the end of the day?

22:47.283 --> 22:49.399
Unfortunately, no.

22:49.619 --> 22:52.736
This wasn't about winning.

22:52.956 --> 22:55.493
This was about me.

22:55.708 --> 22:59.576
My courtroom is designed to
reveal one's inner justice.

22:59.796 --> 23:01.787
[MEGAERA] Only then can
Hephaestus forge a weapon

23:02.006 --> 23:04.713
befitting a warrior.

23:04.926 --> 23:06.336
Ugly bastard.

23:06.553 --> 23:10.171
I have always tried
to protect people, but--

23:10.390 --> 23:12.756
Maybe in the wrong way...

23:12.976 --> 23:16.264
I should be supporting them.

23:16.479 --> 23:17.434
Supporting Lauren.

23:17.647 --> 23:19.512
That is how
I will protect her.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.939
Well done, Bo.

23:22.151 --> 23:25.643
You have found
your inner justice.

23:25.863 --> 23:27.774
[MEGAERA] Use it wisely.

23:38.209 --> 23:46.958
[clanking]

23:49.679 --> 23:52.170
[BO] Hello?

23:52.390 --> 23:55.348
[MAN] You must be Bo.

23:55.560 --> 23:57.425
I am Hephaestus.

23:57.645 --> 24:00.057
More like Hot-Face-stus.

24:00.273 --> 24:03.140
You're the ugliest
of all the Ancients?

24:03.359 --> 24:05.190
By far.

24:05.403 --> 24:08.361
Olympus is a place
of sublime beauty.

24:08.573 --> 24:10.438
Look away, if you must.

24:10.658 --> 24:14.116
I came for Zee.

24:14.329 --> 24:16.615
What is she planning?

24:17.790 --> 24:21.157
[HEPHAESTUS] My fire fuses with
the icy waters of the well,

24:21.377 --> 24:23.629
and from the Yawning
gap, the place of Myth,

24:23.838 --> 24:27.376
I forge a weapon worthy
of the God before me.

24:28.635 --> 24:31.718
I know Zee visited you.

24:31.929 --> 24:33.465
What did she want?

24:33.681 --> 24:35.421
Ask her yourself.

24:39.604 --> 24:40.810
Lauren, what are
you doing here?

24:41.022 --> 24:42.432
[LAUREN]
Deceiving, isn't it?

24:42.649 --> 24:45.607
Turns out not all
blondes have more fun.

24:45.818 --> 24:46.978
Zee?

24:47.195 --> 24:49.151
Now you're catching on.

24:53.785 --> 24:55.821
When I found out
about Lauren's new

24:56.037 --> 24:58.278
conduit capabilities,
lthought

24:58.498 --> 25:00.830
she'll make the
perfect new vessel.

25:01.042 --> 25:02.157
[ZEE] She struggled,

25:02.377 --> 25:06.620
but held on just...
long”.enough.

25:06.839 --> 25:09.421
So that's what happens when
you hold on for too long.

25:09.634 --> 25:10.965
[ZEE] Your girlfriend went
from part-time conduit,

25:11.177 --> 25:12.883
to full time Ancient.

25:13.096 --> 25:14.961
I'd call that a promotion.

25:18.685 --> 25:20.676
Time for a wake up call.

25:24.190 --> 25:26.772
[NURSE] Dr. Lewis, we need
you back at the clinic.

25:26.984 --> 25:29.441
He's awake. Call me back.

25:29.654 --> 25:30.894
[phone beeps]

25:31.114 --> 25:32.729
Kevin?

25:34.450 --> 25:37.658
[KEVIN] Where am I?

25:37.870 --> 25:38.780
What's going on?

25:38.996 --> 25:40.452
You've suffered a
massive heart attack.

25:40.665 --> 25:41.620
You're in recovery.

25:41.833 --> 25:42.948
You don't remember?

25:43.167 --> 25:45.624
My wife.

25:45.837 --> 25:47.498
Where is she?

25:47.714 --> 25:50.421
I want to see Alicia.

25:51.426 --> 25:53.917
No, Kevin, don't
get up, please.

25:56.764 --> 25:58.425
Why is the door locked?!

25:58.641 --> 26:00.848
I'm sorry, the doctor
will be here any minute.

26:01.060 --> 26:03.267
[KEVIN] Please.

26:03.479 --> 26:05.640
I wanna see Alicia.

26:05.857 --> 26:11.523
[gasping]

26:12.947 --> 26:14.608
[beep]

26:24.167 --> 26:26.658
[NURSE screams]

26:26.878 --> 26:29.164
Get the Fae out
of my girlfriend.

26:29.380 --> 26:31.086
You need to
listen to me.

26:31.299 --> 26:33.540
I am your only chance
against Hades.

26:33.760 --> 26:35.170
You knew that I
wouldn't hurt Lauren.

26:35.386 --> 26:37.092
That's why you
chose her body.

26:37.305 --> 26:38.044
What do you want?

26:38.264 --> 26:40.550
To warn you.
Hades might seem benign,

26:40.767 --> 26:43.133
but he's a
master manipulator.

26:43.352 --> 26:45.843
[ZEE] He'll infiltrate
every inch of your life.

26:46.063 --> 26:47.519
Oh, you just
hijack girlfriends.

26:47.732 --> 26:48.812
He's evil, Bo.

26:49.025 --> 26:52.017
Pure and ugly evil.

26:52.236 --> 26:54.101
[ZEE] Looks like
he's already started.

26:54.322 --> 26:56.779
Who is it? The Valkyrie?

26:56.991 --> 26:58.652
The wolf?

26:58.868 --> 27:02.907
Oh... right...

27:03.122 --> 27:04.407
the doctor.

27:04.624 --> 27:07.582
I will never let my father
get between me and Lauren.

27:15.218 --> 27:18.335
The doctor's too weak
to hold on much longer.

27:18.554 --> 27:19.634
Functioning as
a full-time conduit

27:19.847 --> 27:22.224
comes with full-time
side effects.

27:22.433 --> 27:24.344
I can feel her cells
breaking down.

27:24.560 --> 27:25.720
You're killing her.

27:25.937 --> 27:27.518
[ZEE] It's not my
intention to hurt her.

27:27.730 --> 27:29.686
You just need
to listen, Hera.

27:29.899 --> 27:31.560
Zee--

27:31.776 --> 27:33.357
I'm Bo.

27:33.569 --> 27:35.776
Bo?

27:35.988 --> 27:36.613
Bo, where am I?

27:36.823 --> 27:38.529
[BO] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

27:38.741 --> 27:40.277
No, no, no.
Stay with me, Lauren.

27:40.493 --> 27:42.529
Zee. I got you.

27:42.745 --> 27:43.655
[BO sighs]
I got you.

27:43.871 --> 27:45.702
I've had enough of this.
I'm going in.

27:45.915 --> 27:47.906
What about me?

27:49.043 --> 27:49.907
Uh...

27:50.127 --> 27:51.253
[BO] We need to
get you back to the clinic.

27:51.462 --> 27:53.043
Someone there will
know what to do.

27:53.256 --> 27:54.166
We need to wait.

27:54.382 --> 27:55.667
[ZEE] Hepha created
my Aegis Shield

27:55.883 --> 27:58.670
and now he's using it
to forge a weapon for you.

27:58.886 --> 28:00.592
Stay with me Lauren.

28:00.805 --> 28:03.512
[HERA] Oh good,
the gang's all here.

28:03.724 --> 28:04.383
Lauren is dying.

28:04.600 --> 28:05.555
We need to get her
out of here.

28:05.768 --> 28:06.803
[HERA]
Oh that's a pity.

28:07.019 --> 28:09.806
She took such good care
of me. She saved my life.

28:10.022 --> 28:10.807
And why was that?

28:11.023 --> 28:13.400
Because Zeus killed me.

28:13.609 --> 28:16.442
You're not still upset
about that are you?

28:16.654 --> 28:18.815
No!

28:19.031 --> 28:20.407
Lauren's too weak
to hold Zee.

28:20.616 --> 28:22.117
Take me instead.

28:22.326 --> 28:23.532
Elizabeth no!

28:23.744 --> 28:25.280
I've had my eyes
closed long enough,

28:25.496 --> 28:26.360
I've got to open
them if I'm--

28:26.581 --> 28:28.037
if I'm ever gonna--

28:38.968 --> 28:40.378
What?

28:40.595 --> 28:42.460
Someone had to
shut her up.

28:42.680 --> 28:44.420
You need to
get her out of here.

28:45.933 --> 28:47.434
[TAMSIN] It's okay.

28:47.643 --> 28:50.350
Admit it.

28:50.563 --> 28:52.394
You need me.

28:52.607 --> 28:53.847
Say it!

28:54.066 --> 28:57.024
How can you be so stupid?

28:59.488 --> 29:01.740
Of course I need you.

29:04.035 --> 29:06.196
What's the ETA on
that weapon, big guy?

29:06.412 --> 29:09.529
Not in this
lifetime, Succubus.

29:09.749 --> 29:13.333
Now back to plan...
What was our plan?

29:13.544 --> 29:15.455
Oh right.

29:15.671 --> 29:19.129
Plan "Now we kill Bo."

29:26.015 --> 29:28.427
I thought we were
on the same team here?

29:28.643 --> 29:30.099
Hades bad, us good.

29:30.311 --> 29:32.973
Yeah, Zee doesn't need
another sidekick.

29:33.189 --> 29:35.020
I'm her second-in-command.

29:35.232 --> 29:38.520
And now, you're fired.

29:38.736 --> 29:40.818
I believe that's my line.

29:46.410 --> 29:49.573
[30}
You know what they say,

29:49.789 --> 29:52.576
it's better to burn out
than be a total asshole.

29:52.792 --> 29:56.785
Don't play with fire...

29:57.004 --> 30:03.295
[HERA] unless you...
can handle... the burn.

30:06.055 --> 30:07.841
[HERA] Zee, no!

30:10.935 --> 30:14.223
Don't send me back to Myth.

30:14.438 --> 30:16.850
Don't you remember
how bored we both were?

30:17.066 --> 30:19.307
This isn't the end, love.

30:21.320 --> 30:23.652
You trust me don't you?

30:26.450 --> 30:27.986
I do.

30:32.081 --> 30:35.949
[BO] So that's it?
No goodbye cat fight?

30:40.756 --> 30:44.840
I'm so glad we got to
know each other.

30:45.052 --> 30:47.464
[ZEE] My beautiful niece.

30:47.680 --> 30:50.012
You know I defended
people once.

30:50.224 --> 30:53.182
And in return
they worshipped me.

30:53.394 --> 30:55.180
They had sacrifices for me.

30:55.396 --> 30:57.557
Sounds like you had it all.

30:59.233 --> 31:02.316
I-I let it go to my head.

31:02.528 --> 31:05.270
Don't let it go to yours, Bo.

31:05.489 --> 31:07.275
Remember with great
power comes great--

31:07.491 --> 31:09.698
Okay, Voltaire.

31:12.496 --> 31:14.578
[ZEE] Never forget;

31:14.790 --> 31:18.203
Hades' evil
comes in many forms.

31:54.371 --> 31:55.326
[clang]

31:55.539 --> 31:57.655
Bo, what's that?

32:04.048 --> 32:06.209
Hephaestus?!

32:19.647 --> 32:22.514
What the Hepha am I
supposed to do with this?

32:26.654 --> 32:27.484
[ALICIA] Why didn't
anyone tell me about Fae

32:27.696 --> 32:31.359
back in college?
That was--

32:31.575 --> 32:34.066
[laughs]

32:35.121 --> 32:37.578
Speechless? Well,
I'll take speechless.

32:37.790 --> 32:50.419
[phone ringing]

32:50.636 --> 32:52.251
I have to take this.

32:52.471 --> 32:53.847
[phone beeps]

32:54.056 --> 32:55.762
Bo? What's up?

32:55.975 --> 32:58.967
Lauren.

32:59.186 --> 33:01.177
Yeah, she is.

33:05.276 --> 33:07.358
[DYSON]
I'll let her know.

33:07.570 --> 33:09.151
[phone beeps]

33:13.784 --> 33:15.900
I don't like that look.

33:19.290 --> 33:21.531
It's Kevin.

33:29.175 --> 33:32.008
Dyson...

33:32.219 --> 33:34.210
You don't owe me anything.

33:37.433 --> 33:40.425
I want you to live
your life the way it was.

33:42.771 --> 33:45.558
I don't regret anything.

33:52.823 --> 33:53.938
Kevin?

33:54.158 --> 33:56.319
[KEVIN] Baby.

34:04.043 --> 34:05.749
[KEVIN]
It's good to see you.

34:11.467 --> 34:12.923
[BO] I got us pho.

34:13.135 --> 34:15.922
To help you pho-get about
spending an entire day

34:16.138 --> 34:19.130
inside that
psychopath's head.

34:19.350 --> 34:21.056
[30}
Sorry, bad dad joke.

34:21.268 --> 34:22.678
[laughs]

34:22.895 --> 34:24.726
Lauren...

34:24.939 --> 34:26.019
I love you.

34:26.232 --> 34:29.019
And if you want to be Fae,

34:29.235 --> 34:31.317
that's what I want too.

34:31.528 --> 34:33.519
I took the antidote.

34:35.824 --> 34:38.281
I'm not Fae anymore.

34:38.494 --> 34:42.612
Okay, that's uhh--

34:42.831 --> 34:45.789
I'm just glad you're okay.

34:46.460 --> 34:49.247
[BO] Are you okay?

34:49.463 --> 34:51.875
I lost myself.

34:52.091 --> 34:54.628
I was so completely
obsessed with us

34:54.843 --> 34:57.050
that H just lost myself.

34:57.263 --> 35:00.175
But we got you back.

35:00.391 --> 35:02.347
And you're healthy. And...

35:02.559 --> 35:05.722
things can be
the way they were.

35:05.938 --> 35:07.803
You asked me why
I was willing

35:08.023 --> 35:10.856
to give up
who I am to be Fae.

35:11.068 --> 35:13.730
Bo, it was never
about being Fae.

35:13.946 --> 35:15.277
It was about us.
It was about fixing

35:15.489 --> 35:17.320
the one thing
that holds us back.

35:17.533 --> 35:20.445
We don't need to be
fixed. We are perfect.

35:20.661 --> 35:23.824
When I'm old and grey and
losing my mind for real--

35:24.039 --> 35:25.950
[30}
I will still love you.

35:26.166 --> 35:27.542
You, Lauren Lewis.

35:27.751 --> 35:29.867
No matter how many grey
hairs you have on your head.

35:30.087 --> 35:33.420
I know you will, Bo.

35:33.632 --> 35:36.044
That'sjust it, I know
that you will love me

35:36.260 --> 35:39.093
until my last dying breath.

35:40.431 --> 35:43.923
But I can't
do that to you.

35:44.143 --> 35:46.976
I don't want
to do that to you.

35:47.187 --> 35:48.393
That is my decision.

35:48.605 --> 35:50.812
[LAUREN] No. Bo, it's
not just your decision.

35:51.025 --> 35:53.562
This is because of Jack.
Don't you see that?

35:53.777 --> 35:54.857
Don't you see
what he's done?

35:55.070 --> 35:56.105
This is what he wants.

35:56.322 --> 35:58.028
No, Bo. It's not...

35:58.240 --> 36:00.356
because of him.

36:00.576 --> 36:04.910
This is about you and me.

36:05.122 --> 36:07.408
I'm supposed to be a healer.

36:07.624 --> 36:09.751
And you're a protector.

36:09.960 --> 36:13.123
And I risked all of that.

36:15.382 --> 36:19.125
All I want...

36:19.345 --> 36:21.336
is you.

36:23.015 --> 36:25.631
I just--| can't!

36:25.851 --> 36:30.094
People need you.
People need me.

36:30.314 --> 36:34.102
Please, don't do
this, Lauren.

36:34.318 --> 36:34.977
Not again.

36:35.194 --> 36:38.186
[LAUREN] Oh Bo,
believe me, I know.

36:38.405 --> 36:41.818
I am so sorry.

36:43.202 --> 36:45.193
I love you.

37:09.853 --> 37:13.345
[breathes heavily]

37:15.401 --> 37:16.982
Let me get
something straight,

37:17.194 --> 37:19.936
[B0] in case it's not
abundantly clear.

37:20.155 --> 37:21.486
You and me.

37:21.698 --> 37:23.654
Never gonna happen.

37:23.867 --> 37:26.028
You found Zee.

37:26.245 --> 37:27.610
How is the old girl?

37:27.830 --> 37:31.322
This is all a game
to you. Isn't it?

37:31.542 --> 37:32.577
[BO] You just set up
the chess pieces,

37:32.793 --> 37:35.876
and you sit back and
you watch them fall.

37:36.088 --> 37:38.921
Whatever you are planning...

37:39.133 --> 37:42.717
Go. Do it.

37:42.928 --> 37:45.385
I'm done waiting.

37:45.597 --> 37:47.337
It's your move.

37:47.558 --> 37:49.344
Lauren reversed the serum.

37:49.560 --> 37:51.141
[BO] Not before it
nearly killed her.

37:51.353 --> 37:52.559
Bravo.

37:52.771 --> 37:55.638
Your master plan worked.

37:55.858 --> 37:56.893
Lauren and I are done.

37:57.109 --> 38:00.727
--[JACK] 30--
--[BO] Do not "Bo" me.

38:00.946 --> 38:02.356
This is what you wanted.

38:02.573 --> 38:04.109
[JACK]
Of course it's not.

38:04.324 --> 38:06.235
I want my daughter
to be happy.

38:06.452 --> 38:10.195
Hades wants me to be happy.

38:10.414 --> 38:15.909
People like us, we are
capable of many things.

38:16.128 --> 38:19.541
But love?

38:19.756 --> 38:22.998
She's gone, Dad.

38:23.218 --> 38:25.129
We're over.

38:25.345 --> 38:28.337
[JACK] Babe...

38:28.557 --> 38:31.469
I didn't come here
to ruin your life.

38:38.775 --> 38:41.266
I think I should
take a step back.

38:41.487 --> 38:43.569
Let you sort things out.

38:43.780 --> 38:45.566
But I'll be here.

38:45.782 --> 38:48.398
I'll be right here

38:48.619 --> 38:51.110
if you decide
you need me.

38:52.789 --> 38:57.283
Great. Everyone's
breaking up with me today.

38:57.503 --> 39:00.085
[JACK] Gods no. You haven't
heard a word I've said.

39:00.297 --> 39:03.960
Without family,
we're nothing.

39:04.176 --> 39:06.508
But I can only lead
you to the water,

39:06.720 --> 39:09.302
Icannot
force you to drink.

39:09.515 --> 39:14.054
And we're back to
the horse metaphors.

39:14.269 --> 39:16.476
But you're right.

39:16.688 --> 39:21.273
You can't force me to drink...

39:21.485 --> 39:23.726
and I never will.

39:30.702 --> 39:32.613
[TRICK]
Definitely adamantine.

39:32.829 --> 39:35.036
But there's
something else, too.

39:35.249 --> 39:36.455
Pure gold.

39:36.667 --> 39:39.374
A horseshoe's not a weapon,
it's a parlour game.

39:39.586 --> 39:43.545
In lore, the horseshoe
symbolizes protection,

39:43.757 --> 39:46.089
wards off evil,
and brings good luck.

39:46.301 --> 39:49.964
Yeah well, I'm not feeling
especially lucky right now.

39:50.180 --> 39:51.795
[TRICK]
I'll keep looking.

39:52.015 --> 39:56.054
In the meantime,
this belongs to you.

40:05.737 --> 40:08.900
All of that over
a gods damn horseshoe.

40:12.411 --> 40:15.574
Maybe Jack's right.

40:15.789 --> 40:18.496
Maybe I'm not made for love.

40:18.709 --> 40:22.998
I think the
opposite is true.

40:23.213 --> 40:24.874
But if there's
one thing I have learned

40:25.090 --> 40:27.752
from loving you it's, um...

40:27.968 --> 40:30.334
Bet on getting
your heart broken?

40:30.554 --> 40:33.136
Better to have
loved and lost.

40:36.727 --> 40:39.309
You cared for Alicia.

40:42.774 --> 40:44.890
I didn't think I could...

40:57.414 --> 41:01.657
[footsteps]

41:01.877 --> 41:05.335
[TAMSIN sighs]

41:05.547 --> 41:08.038
We gotta do something
about this wallow.

41:08.258 --> 41:09.338
It's all wrong.

41:09.551 --> 41:13.135
You're critiquing my wallow?

41:13.347 --> 41:17.511
Wallow requirement
numero uno: snacks.

41:17.726 --> 41:19.842
I'll order pizza?

41:20.062 --> 41:21.393
[sobbing]

41:21.605 --> 41:24.722
Oh, oh, okay, or, uhh,
it doesn't have to be pizza.

41:24.941 --> 41:27.978
I can order sushi?
Or, or Chinese?

41:28.195 --> 41:32.564
She's gone, Tamsin.

41:32.783 --> 41:34.489
We're over.

41:34.701 --> 41:37.158
Look, you do whatever
you need to do.

41:37.371 --> 41:39.987
YOU can cry, or scream--

41:40.207 --> 41:42.323
Whatever feels right.

42:00.894 --> 42:04.432
Or that works too...

42:04.648 --> 42:06.764
Um...

42:06.983 --> 42:10.771
But--
Just maybe not with me?

42:12.489 --> 42:21.705
No matter how much I try,
someone always ends up hurt.

42:21.915 --> 42:22.620
It's just, we're friends

42:22.833 --> 42:25.245
without benefits,
remember?

42:29.256 --> 42:31.042
I'm sorry.

42:31.258 --> 42:33.544
[TAMSIN] It's okay.

42:35.804 --> 42:37.795
I'm gonna go to bed.

42:42.602 --> 42:45.469
Bo, wait. Bo.

42:54.281 --> 42:56.363
I'm gonna regret
this later.

43:26.021 --> 43:30.481
[TAMSIN breathes heavily]

43:36.156 --> 43:41.150
[closing theme]
