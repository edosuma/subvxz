00:04.087 --> 00:05.672
* It's the smell in the air *

00:05.714 --> 00:07.340
* And the sound of the season *

00:07.382 --> 00:10.927
* Having family around
is the best kind of feeling *

00:10.969 --> 00:15.306
* I love the way I feel
this time of year *

00:15.348 --> 00:16.850
* Every day
should feel like Christmas *

00:16.891 --> 00:21.187
[***]

00:21.229 --> 00:22.981
* Every day
should feel like Christmas *

00:23.023 --> 00:25.442
* Unwrap the gifts of love... *

00:28.236 --> 00:30.321
I consolidated that
into your primary account.

00:30.363 --> 00:32.532
It's just safer.
Better interest rates, too.

00:32.574 --> 00:34.701
Yes, I completely agree.

00:34.743 --> 00:36.619
Transparency is key.

00:36.661 --> 00:38.371
So, are you good?

00:38.413 --> 00:40.915
Yes, teenagers
are impossible to buy for.

00:40.957 --> 00:42.542
How about a pair
of Bluetooth headphones?

00:42.584 --> 00:43.918
My son loves his.

00:43.960 --> 00:45.712
They're on sale at Davros's--
20% off.

00:45.754 --> 00:47.130
Of course,
I'm happy to help.

00:47.172 --> 00:49.382
You too.
Happy holidays.

00:49.424 --> 00:51.176
Do I need to talk to HR
about client boundaries?

00:51.217 --> 00:52.552
It is very important

00:52.594 --> 00:54.387
that I have a good relationship
with my clients.

00:54.429 --> 00:57.223
And that's why you have
the big corner office.

00:57.265 --> 00:59.184
-[clink]
-Cheers to that.

00:59.225 --> 01:01.561
Oh, Ms. Dalton! Hi.

01:01.603 --> 01:02.687
Hi. Hi.

01:02.729 --> 01:04.189
Ellie, what's the word?
Everything okay?

01:04.230 --> 01:05.482
Yes, okay, so, um, uh...

01:05.523 --> 01:07.233
the final specs
on your bathroom remodel

01:07.275 --> 01:08.777
just came in,
so I put them on your desk.

01:08.818 --> 01:10.653
Your dry cleaning will be
delivered tomorrow morning,

01:10.695 --> 01:12.447
and McKenzie's will have
dinner sent by seven.

01:12.489 --> 01:14.657
I made sure to tell them
"no cilantro".

01:14.699 --> 01:15.950
Okay, great.

01:15.992 --> 01:17.744
Now stop working
and enjoy yourself.

01:17.786 --> 01:19.037
This is your holidays.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.080
Are you sure?

01:20.121 --> 01:21.581
You don't need anything else?

01:21.623 --> 01:24.167
I could, like, I don't know--
organize client files,

01:24.209 --> 01:26.002
I could tie up loose ends
on any statements?

01:26.044 --> 01:27.003
Go have a drink
and enjoy yourself,

01:27.045 --> 01:27.879
before I fire you.

01:29.506 --> 01:30.924
Uh, I'm...

01:30.965 --> 01:32.509
Ellie, I'm kidding.

01:32.550 --> 01:34.094
Oh!

01:34.135 --> 01:35.804
[forced laugh]

01:35.845 --> 01:37.347
Okay, yeah!

01:37.389 --> 01:40.058
Thanks, Ms. Dalton--
I mean, uh, Melanie.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.226
Ms. Dalton.

01:42.977 --> 01:45.146
Okay, yeah.

01:47.273 --> 01:48.358
It must feel nice
to be worshipped.

01:48.400 --> 01:49.693
Just don't let it
get to your head.

01:49.734 --> 01:51.277
Oh, it is impossible
to have an inflated ego

01:51.319 --> 01:52.529
when you have a teenager.

01:52.570 --> 01:53.988
Are you kidding me?
I leave this building,

01:54.030 --> 01:55.615
and I am just "Melanie Dalton,

01:55.657 --> 01:57.283
the most annoying mother
in the world."

01:57.325 --> 01:59.411
He'll come around.
It's been a tough year.

02:00.412 --> 02:01.371
[sighs]

02:01.413 --> 02:02.831
Okay. should we
go exchange gifts

02:02.872 --> 02:04.207
before Richard does
his end-of-the-year speech?

02:04.249 --> 02:05.542
I thought you would never ask.

02:05.583 --> 02:06.751
[laughing]

02:08.795 --> 02:09.838
Thank you.

02:15.176 --> 02:16.928
Oh, come on!

02:16.970 --> 02:18.555
How cute are these?

02:18.596 --> 02:20.598
Thank you, Claire.
I love them.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.559
Of course. I know
how important sleep is for you.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.352
I cannot believe

02:24.394 --> 02:27.313
that, last year, we were
sitting in this very room

02:27.355 --> 02:29.816
as I bawled my eyes out
and you consoled me.

02:29.858 --> 02:31.109
I was such a mess.

02:31.151 --> 02:32.485
Thank you
for being a good friend.

02:32.527 --> 02:35.280
Divorce isn't easy,
but look at you--

02:35.321 --> 02:37.157
you did it,
you got through it,

02:37.198 --> 02:38.992
and you're on
the other side now.

02:39.034 --> 02:40.660
Yeah, I'm just not so sure
Jase is.

02:40.702 --> 02:42.287
He really misses his dad.

02:42.328 --> 02:43.997
Well, at least they get
to spend Christmas together.

02:44.039 --> 02:45.999
Yeah, Max gets to be
"the cool Dad"

02:46.041 --> 02:50.003
who whisks him away to Whistler
with his fun girlfriend,

02:50.045 --> 02:51.713
and I get all the attitude.

02:51.755 --> 02:53.590
I swear,
I'm not bitter.

02:53.631 --> 02:55.258
You're allowed
to feel frustrated,

02:55.300 --> 02:57.635
or envious or sad.

02:57.677 --> 02:59.429
I know I would.

02:59.471 --> 03:02.140
I'm just gonna really miss
not spending Christmas with him.

03:02.182 --> 03:03.600
I'll be a phone call away
if you need anything.

03:03.641 --> 03:04.684
You know that.

03:04.726 --> 03:05.727
Thanks, Claire.

03:07.228 --> 03:08.938
And, actually...

03:08.980 --> 03:10.523
if you're feeling adventurous,

03:10.565 --> 03:12.859
Tom from Accounting
was looking pretty good tonight.

03:12.901 --> 03:14.903
Maybe you could see
if he wants to go to dinner.

03:14.944 --> 03:16.029
Oh, come on!

03:16.071 --> 03:17.781
Absolutely not.

03:17.822 --> 03:19.407
Why?

03:19.449 --> 03:21.368
Well, because I don't even know
if I'm ready to date yet,

03:21.409 --> 03:24.162
and when I do, it will not be
"Tom in Accounting".

03:24.204 --> 03:25.538
Okay. [laughs]

03:25.580 --> 03:28.208
That's fair, fine,
but it doesn't need to be him.

03:28.249 --> 03:29.793
But are you open
to the idea?

03:29.834 --> 03:31.961
[deep breath] I don't know.

03:32.003 --> 03:33.672
Maybe.

03:33.713 --> 03:34.839
I know you.

03:34.881 --> 03:36.216
When you've been hurt,

03:36.257 --> 03:38.551
you put up those walls
and you don't let anyone in,

03:38.593 --> 03:41.054
but come on,
it's Christmas.

03:41.096 --> 03:43.556
Maybe it's a good time for you
to let down your guard a bit

03:43.598 --> 03:46.101
and be open
to something new.

03:46.142 --> 03:47.310
I am gonna be...

03:47.352 --> 03:48.895
wearing these,

03:48.937 --> 03:50.522
watching
Christmas movies all day.

03:50.563 --> 03:51.648
[laughing]

03:51.690 --> 03:52.816
Okay, that doesn't sound
too bad either.

03:52.857 --> 03:54.067
No.

03:54.109 --> 03:55.151
Maybe some of this, too?

03:55.193 --> 03:57.278
[giggling]

04:00.824 --> 04:03.284
[***]

04:08.498 --> 04:09.958
Jase?

04:11.042 --> 04:13.003
Jason?

04:13.044 --> 04:14.963
Jason, I'm home!

04:19.592 --> 04:21.845
[knocks]
Hello? Earth to Jason?

04:21.886 --> 04:23.430
[sighing irately]

04:24.180 --> 04:25.306
What?

04:25.348 --> 04:26.558
Are you all packed?

04:26.599 --> 04:27.726
Your dad said
he'd be here around nine.

04:27.767 --> 04:29.102
Pretty much.

04:29.144 --> 04:30.770
Okay, why don't I
help you, then?

04:30.812 --> 04:32.689
I'm good.

04:32.731 --> 04:34.107
Let me just make sure
that everything--

04:34.149 --> 04:35.442
-No, hey! I said I'm good.
-Okay.

04:35.483 --> 04:36.901
-Please. Don't touch my stuff.
-Okay.

04:36.943 --> 04:38.278
Look.

04:38.319 --> 04:40.739
I want you to have
the best Christmas ever

04:40.780 --> 04:41.906
in Whistler,

04:41.948 --> 04:43.783
but you cannot forget
your paper is due.

04:43.825 --> 04:44.826
How can I forget?

04:44.868 --> 04:47.287
You've only reminded me
every day.

04:47.328 --> 04:49.372
You got yourself
into this situation.

04:49.414 --> 04:50.707
Do you wanna be held back?

04:50.749 --> 04:52.959
Yeah, Mom,
I want to be held back.

04:53.001 --> 04:53.918
[sighs]

04:55.378 --> 04:57.297
Turn it off, now!

04:57.339 --> 04:58.840
-Hey!
-It's bedtime.

05:01.259 --> 05:03.428
I can't wait to get away
from this place.

05:04.763 --> 05:07.015
[***]

05:13.355 --> 05:15.940
[phone rings]

05:18.193 --> 05:20.111
Max? Are you here already?

05:22.697 --> 05:24.240
What?

05:24.282 --> 05:26.284
You're kidding me.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.161
He is going to be
so disappointed.

05:28.203 --> 05:29.245
We'll talk about this later.

05:29.287 --> 05:30.747
Hey.

05:32.248 --> 05:33.792
He's not coming, is he?

05:33.833 --> 05:34.918
[words catch]

05:34.959 --> 05:36.336
It's Laura. [sighs]

05:36.378 --> 05:38.046
She has the flu.

05:38.088 --> 05:39.547
I-I don't care about Laura!

05:39.589 --> 05:41.341
I just want to go
snowboarding with Dad.

05:41.383 --> 05:42.425
He said he promises--

05:42.467 --> 05:44.135
This isn't fair!

05:44.177 --> 05:46.680
I know, Jase.
I'm so sorry.

05:46.721 --> 05:49.683
I told all my friends
that I was going away,

05:49.724 --> 05:52.519
and now I'm just gonna be
stuck here all Christmas.

05:52.560 --> 05:55.230
You know that I would take you
in a heartbeat,

05:55.271 --> 05:56.940
but I don't have
my passport yet.

05:56.981 --> 05:59.859
We're gonna have a really fun
Christmas together, I promise.

05:59.901 --> 06:02.112
All you ever do
is boring work stuff.

06:02.153 --> 06:04.364
Hey! That is not true.

06:04.406 --> 06:06.199
I am just as fun as your dad.

06:06.241 --> 06:07.909
Yeah. Whatever.

06:09.327 --> 06:12.831
[sighs]

06:12.872 --> 06:13.998
I love you!

06:16.918 --> 06:18.128
[sighs heavily]

06:18.169 --> 06:20.422
[***]

06:21.840 --> 06:23.133
You're kidding me.

06:23.174 --> 06:24.551
[Mel, on phone] <i>I know!</i>
<i>It's unbelievable.</i>

06:24.592 --> 06:26.011
Every single ski resort
I've tried

06:26.052 --> 06:27.303
is completely booked--

06:27.345 --> 06:29.556
Vail, Copper Mountain,
Beaver Creek.

06:29.597 --> 06:31.349
<i>We have to do something.</i>
<i>You should have seen</i>

06:31.391 --> 06:32.767
the look on his face.

06:32.809 --> 06:34.310
Poor kid.

06:34.352 --> 06:36.438
I refuse to spend Christmas
watching him play video games.

06:36.479 --> 06:38.106
Well, what about
going to Mexico?

06:38.148 --> 06:39.441
I don't have my passport,
remember?

06:39.482 --> 06:40.859
And I really wanna
go somewhere where

06:40.900 --> 06:42.736
he can get into the Christmas
spirit, like he used to.

06:42.777 --> 06:44.654
-North Pole?
<i>-I also want to be able</i>

06:44.696 --> 06:45.947
to get there
within three hours,

06:45.989 --> 06:47.574
and maybe get
a decent cup of coffee.

06:47.615 --> 06:48.908
Okay, not the North Pole.

06:48.950 --> 06:50.660
Booked.

06:50.702 --> 06:52.454
Booked...

06:53.788 --> 06:56.666
Wait a minute, have you heard
of "St. Nicholas Island"?

06:56.708 --> 06:59.419
No, but I'm intrigued.
Tell me more.

06:59.461 --> 07:01.254
"Arrive by water taxi

07:01.296 --> 07:04.132
and spend Christmas
in a unique location

07:04.174 --> 07:05.467
by taking residence

07:05.508 --> 07:08.553
in a historic
and idyllic lighthouse.

07:08.595 --> 07:09.929
The island is known

07:09.971 --> 07:12.349
for its enchanting
and festive community events,

07:12.390 --> 07:14.601
and Christmas lights festival."

07:14.642 --> 07:15.935
That sounds incredible!

07:15.977 --> 07:16.811
See if it's available.

07:18.063 --> 07:20.023
It says four other people
are interested.

07:20.065 --> 07:21.149
[gasps] Now five!

07:21.191 --> 07:22.275
Okay, well, hurry up and book!

07:22.317 --> 07:23.735
-Are you sure?
<i>-Yes! Prove to Jason</i>

07:23.777 --> 07:25.779
he has more than
just one adventurous parent.

07:25.820 --> 07:27.364
Okay.

07:27.405 --> 07:28.698
[click]

07:28.740 --> 07:29.783
Booked.

07:29.824 --> 07:32.535
[***]

07:32.577 --> 07:34.329
Pack your bags, kid!

07:34.371 --> 07:36.331
We're spending Christmas
in a lighthouse.

07:36.373 --> 07:38.875
[***]

07:46.341 --> 07:48.343
I can't believe
I forgot the Dramamine.

07:48.385 --> 07:50.595
[breathes deeply]
Ohh. Just breathe!

07:50.637 --> 07:53.473
Just breathe.

07:53.515 --> 07:55.100
Want a bite?

07:55.141 --> 07:57.018
Oh. [gags]

07:58.311 --> 08:00.313
I'm good.

08:00.355 --> 08:02.107
You look kinda green, Mom.

08:02.148 --> 08:04.025
Just a little sea-dizzy.

08:06.152 --> 08:07.404
I'm gonna go stretch my legs.

08:07.445 --> 08:08.947
Do you want to come?

08:08.988 --> 08:10.448
And watch you yack?

08:10.490 --> 08:12.200
-Ugh!
-I'm good.

08:14.786 --> 08:16.871
Okay...

08:16.913 --> 08:18.206
Hoo.

08:18.248 --> 08:19.958
Okay... focus on your breathing.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.501
[inhaling] In...

08:21.543 --> 08:23.128
[exhales] ...and out.

08:23.169 --> 08:24.337
[man] Hey, you all right?

08:24.379 --> 08:25.922
Ooh! I'm fine.

08:25.964 --> 08:27.382
The water's getting
a little choppy.

08:27.424 --> 08:28.758
Maybe you should move.

08:28.800 --> 08:29.884
I'm okay!

08:29.926 --> 08:31.094
Ma'am, I-I don't think
you understand.

08:31.136 --> 08:33.179
Please, just let me
focus on my breathing.

08:33.221 --> 08:34.389
[Mel wheezes]

08:34.431 --> 08:36.307
Don't call me "ma'am".

08:38.226 --> 08:39.227
All right.

08:40.311 --> 08:42.188
-[splashing]
-[gasping]

08:42.230 --> 08:43.648
[huffs indignantly]

08:44.566 --> 08:46.276
Seriously?

08:46.317 --> 08:47.360
[laughing]

08:47.402 --> 08:48.528
Are you laughing right now?

08:48.570 --> 08:50.739
I-- sorry. I...

08:50.780 --> 08:52.323
Look, I tried to warn you.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.200
[huffs]

08:54.242 --> 08:55.702
Here. Use this.

08:57.078 --> 08:58.371
[gags]

08:58.413 --> 09:00.373
Are you trying
to make me more nauseous?

09:00.415 --> 09:02.042
This smells like
three-day-old fish!

09:02.083 --> 09:03.793
Look, you do realize
this water taxi's

09:03.835 --> 09:06.796
going to St. Nicholas Island,
not a five-star resort, right?

09:06.838 --> 09:07.881
Really?

09:07.922 --> 09:09.966
I thought
we were going to Hawaii.

09:10.008 --> 09:13.053
Okay, if I were you,
I'd, uh, I'd get back inside.

09:13.094 --> 09:14.137
Like, now.

09:14.179 --> 09:16.139
You are not
the captain of this ship.

09:16.181 --> 09:18.058
I will do what I want to do.

09:18.850 --> 09:21.102
-[splashing]
-[shrieking]

09:23.104 --> 09:25.690
[***]

09:31.946 --> 09:34.240
Welcome to St. Nicholas Island,
you two.

09:34.282 --> 09:36.826
Always a pleasure having
city folk here for the holidays.

09:36.868 --> 09:38.119
Thanks.

09:38.161 --> 09:39.079
Sorry. What did you say
your name was, again?

09:39.120 --> 09:40.372
Earl.

09:40.413 --> 09:41.998
Earl Gleeman,
of Gleeman Transport.

09:42.040 --> 09:43.750
Oh.

09:43.792 --> 09:44.918
I'm also property manager
of the lighthouse.

09:44.959 --> 09:47.754
I'm Melanie
and behind us is Jason.

09:47.796 --> 09:49.714
Nice to meet you both.

09:49.756 --> 09:51.299
Jason. Say hi.

09:52.425 --> 09:53.885
Hi.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.261
[laughs]

09:55.303 --> 09:56.763
He's a man of few words.

09:56.805 --> 09:58.139
He typically just grunts,

09:58.181 --> 09:59.766
so if he's saying hi,
I think he really likes you.

09:59.808 --> 10:01.101
I'll take what I can get.

10:01.142 --> 10:02.268
[chuckles]

10:02.310 --> 10:04.771
[***]

10:13.530 --> 10:15.198
[Jason]
This is where we're staying?

10:15.240 --> 10:16.950
Come on!
It's gonna be fun.

10:16.991 --> 10:19.703
A little rustic adventure
never hurt anyone.

10:19.744 --> 10:21.204
You guys are gonna love it.

10:21.246 --> 10:23.707
Hopefully, I have
my tetanus shots up to date.

10:23.748 --> 10:25.667
Online, it looked like
a Yuletide dream.

10:25.709 --> 10:27.460
Come on, let's go inside.

10:27.502 --> 10:28.545
Can I give you a hand?

10:28.586 --> 10:30.171
We're fine.

10:31.631 --> 10:34.009
[***]

10:38.096 --> 10:39.973
Really, Mom?

10:40.015 --> 10:43.852
This is your idea
of a fun Christmas vacation?

10:43.893 --> 10:45.729
Um...

10:45.770 --> 10:47.564
on the photos,

10:47.605 --> 10:50.942
this entire place
was decorated in Christmas.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.902
Yeah, well,
I think you got scammed.

10:52.944 --> 10:55.697
[sighs]

10:57.073 --> 10:59.325
You didn't tell me
we had duties!

10:59.367 --> 11:00.910
[sighs]

11:00.952 --> 11:03.038
This is just a list of chores.

11:03.079 --> 11:05.373
What? No!

11:05.415 --> 11:06.833
This is absolutely unacceptable!

11:06.875 --> 11:08.376
I'm calling the owner.

11:08.418 --> 11:11.963
Whoever this Peter Sanderson is
is gonna get an earful.

11:13.214 --> 11:14.174
[fast busy]

11:16.384 --> 11:18.470
No service.

11:18.511 --> 11:19.971
There's no service?

11:20.013 --> 11:22.557
Mom, I can't do a whole week
without Wi-Fi!

11:22.599 --> 11:24.225
How am I gonna Snap my friends?

11:24.267 --> 11:26.186
Is this supposed to be some sort
of punishment or something?

11:26.227 --> 11:27.145
All right, just wait!

11:27.187 --> 11:29.397
[yells] Earl! Earl?

11:29.439 --> 11:31.524
[wheezing] Whew!

11:31.566 --> 11:33.151
Sorry. Hi. Um...

11:33.193 --> 11:36.363
do you know
who Peter Sanderson is?

11:36.404 --> 11:38.448
Of course.
Everyone knows Pete.

11:38.490 --> 11:39.866
Do you know
where I can find him?

11:39.908 --> 11:41.951
This time of day?
Probably at Ruth's.

11:41.993 --> 11:43.495
Ruth's.

11:43.536 --> 11:45.205
Where's Ruth's?

11:45.246 --> 11:46.331
I'll take you there.

11:46.373 --> 11:47.999
Thank you.

11:55.423 --> 11:56.591
Earl!

11:56.633 --> 11:58.885
Twice in one day, huh?

11:58.927 --> 12:01.221
Can't stop thinking about
your shortbread cookies, Ruthy.

12:01.262 --> 12:02.847
Can I get a few
for our newcomers?

12:02.889 --> 12:05.266
You bet.
Comin' right up.

12:06.643 --> 12:07.977
Okay.

12:08.019 --> 12:10.689
Okay, so, is he here?

12:10.730 --> 12:11.898
[Earl] Uh, let's see.

12:13.358 --> 12:16.236
How can you tell anyone apart
in this sea of flannel?

12:16.277 --> 12:18.279
Sorry.

12:19.447 --> 12:21.783
There he is, right there.

12:23.243 --> 12:24.911
Your mom's quite
a whipper-snapper, isn't she?

12:24.953 --> 12:26.579
That's one way to put it.

12:26.621 --> 12:28.581
I'll get us a hot chocolate.

12:28.623 --> 12:30.041
Sorry, um...

12:31.209 --> 12:32.210
Sorry.

12:32.252 --> 12:33.294
-Sorry.
-Hi.

12:33.336 --> 12:35.046
Hi.

12:35.839 --> 12:37.841
Excuse me, sir?

12:37.882 --> 12:38.758
[darkly] You.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.802
-You?
-Of course!

12:40.844 --> 12:42.595
Of course, you're the owner
of the lighthouse.

12:42.637 --> 12:45.515
I am.
Is there a problem?

12:45.557 --> 12:46.683
Yes, there is a problem.

12:46.725 --> 12:47.767
My son and I
are supposed to be here

12:47.809 --> 12:49.477
for a nice Christmas vacation--

12:49.519 --> 12:51.479
[raising voice] ...and instead
we are at a seaside shanty

12:51.521 --> 12:52.939
with Christmas duties?

12:52.981 --> 12:55.567
You clearly didn't read
the booking instructions,

12:55.608 --> 12:56.943
-did you?
-What are you talking about?

12:56.985 --> 12:58.862
Well, you're
the lighthouse keeper this week.

13:00.321 --> 13:01.906
-I beg your pardon?
-Well, it states

13:01.948 --> 13:03.283
in the booking instructions--

13:03.324 --> 13:05.076
whoever stays in the lighthouse
over Christmas

13:05.118 --> 13:07.537
must help transform it
for the Christmas Festival.

13:07.579 --> 13:09.914
It's, um...
"the Christmas Star".

13:09.956 --> 13:11.541
The Christmas Star?

13:11.583 --> 13:13.793
Sorry, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

13:13.835 --> 13:17.005
Uh, Ruth?
Can you help me out here?

13:17.047 --> 13:19.466
Well, as legend has it,
many years ago,

13:19.507 --> 13:20.967
there was this heavy fog,

13:21.009 --> 13:23.053
and St. Nicholas
was lost at sea

13:23.094 --> 13:24.804
as he was trying
to deliver presents

13:24.846 --> 13:26.056
to the old orphanage here,

13:26.097 --> 13:28.141
and he almost gave up hope,
until...

13:28.183 --> 13:29.267
the light
from the lighthouse

13:29.309 --> 13:31.061
suddenly appeared
out of the darkness,

13:31.102 --> 13:32.645
and it guided him to safety.

13:32.687 --> 13:35.148
He called it
his "Christmas Star",

13:35.190 --> 13:36.483
and since that time forward,

13:36.524 --> 13:37.984
it's always been
a symbol of hope,

13:38.026 --> 13:39.694
and for over a century,

13:39.736 --> 13:40.820
it has been the main attraction

13:40.862 --> 13:42.739
at our annual
Christmas Light Festival.

13:42.781 --> 13:44.574
Wait, hold on. So...

13:44.616 --> 13:47.744
you want me and my son to help
you decorate your lighthouse

13:47.786 --> 13:49.329
for a Christmas festival?

13:49.371 --> 13:51.081
Bingo.

13:51.122 --> 13:52.832
And why can't you do it?

13:52.874 --> 13:54.459
Well, he despises Christmas.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.795
He's an absolute Scrooge!

13:56.836 --> 13:58.129
He's allergic to the holidays.

13:58.171 --> 13:59.923
He won't even pretend
to indulge,

13:59.964 --> 14:01.424
and in fact,

14:01.466 --> 14:05.512
this is his first Christmas back
in, what, eight years?

14:05.553 --> 14:07.263
[chuckles]
What she said.

14:07.305 --> 14:08.932
[chuckles, scoffs]

14:08.973 --> 14:10.892
This is ridiculous.

14:10.934 --> 14:12.435
This is supposed to be
my Christmas vacation.

14:12.477 --> 14:14.604
Listen, the lighthouse
practically runs itself.

14:14.646 --> 14:16.064
It-It's-It's automated.

14:16.106 --> 14:17.982
All we ask you to do
is just...

14:18.024 --> 14:20.402
give it a Christmas makeover
before December 23rd.

14:20.443 --> 14:22.153
What if I decide to leave?

14:22.195 --> 14:23.363
Go for it.

14:23.405 --> 14:24.614
The next water taxi
leaves tomorrow at noon.

14:24.656 --> 14:26.032
Perfect!

14:26.074 --> 14:27.200
But just so you know,

14:27.242 --> 14:29.285
you'll be letting down
an entire island

14:29.327 --> 14:30.912
of hopeful
Christmas enthusiasts--

14:30.954 --> 14:33.373
including many, many...

14:33.415 --> 14:35.625
many children.

14:35.667 --> 14:37.961
This is not
what I signed up for!

14:38.003 --> 14:39.546
Actually, it's exactly
what you signed up for.

14:39.587 --> 14:41.172
[huffs irately]

14:42.340 --> 14:43.800
[heels clopping]

14:43.842 --> 14:44.884
Let's go!

14:44.926 --> 14:46.594
50 bucks says
she leaves.

14:46.636 --> 14:47.971
[heels clopping]

14:48.013 --> 14:49.389
[***]

14:49.431 --> 14:50.432
You're on.

14:53.101 --> 14:54.894
"For the care and upkeep

14:54.936 --> 14:56.896
of the St. Nicholas Island
Lighthouse--"

14:56.938 --> 14:58.064
...blah, blah, blah.

14:58.106 --> 14:59.232
"Staying here,
you will be responsible

14:59.274 --> 15:01.317
for preparing
and decorating the space

15:01.359 --> 15:05.280
for the upcoming St. Nicholas
Christmas Lights Festival."

15:05.321 --> 15:06.239
Is this a joke?

15:06.281 --> 15:08.199
I'm sorry.

15:08.241 --> 15:10.744
I signed us up
for a week of chores

15:10.785 --> 15:12.287
and didn't even realize it,

15:12.328 --> 15:13.747
but let's keep
an open mind, okay?

15:13.788 --> 15:15.623
This could be
a fun experience for us.

15:15.665 --> 15:17.208
"Decorating duties include--

15:17.250 --> 15:19.002
stringing the lights,
hanging the wreaths,

15:19.044 --> 15:20.086
wrapping the garland,

15:20.128 --> 15:21.880
and placing
the lawn decorations."

15:21.921 --> 15:23.506
Hard pass.

15:23.548 --> 15:25.508
It's actually not that bad.

15:25.550 --> 15:27.552
Can we please just go home?

15:27.594 --> 15:30.138
I'm not gonna spend a week
decorating this place.

15:30.180 --> 15:31.890
Okay, buddy, listen--

15:31.931 --> 15:33.016
-[thud]
-Wait!

15:33.058 --> 15:34.893
-Oh!
-I got it, I got it--

15:34.934 --> 15:36.603
[Jason groans]

15:36.644 --> 15:39.189
"My trip to the Space Needle."

15:40.357 --> 15:41.608
Is this
your friend Joel's paper?

15:41.649 --> 15:42.942
Maybe.

15:42.984 --> 15:44.778
-Jason!
-So?

15:44.819 --> 15:46.237
"So," your makeup assignment

15:46.279 --> 15:48.782
is a 10-page paper
on a historic landmark.

15:48.823 --> 15:50.241
And?

15:50.283 --> 15:51.826
And your friend Joel's paper
is in your backpack--

15:51.868 --> 15:53.620
do you think I'm stupid?

15:53.661 --> 15:55.330
Don't answer that question.

15:55.372 --> 15:56.790
[sighing]

15:56.831 --> 15:58.124
Were you gonna
copy his paper?

15:59.250 --> 16:02.128
I wasn't gonna copy it
word-for-word,

16:02.170 --> 16:04.172
I was just gonna use it
as, like...

16:04.214 --> 16:06.132
I don't know, a reference?

16:06.174 --> 16:07.967
Okay. I don't believe you,

16:08.009 --> 16:09.010
and this is going
in the garbage.

16:09.052 --> 16:10.553
Wait! No, please!
Please. No.

16:10.595 --> 16:11.721
I spent 25 bucks!

16:13.223 --> 16:15.850
You are lucky that I don't
ground you for three months!

16:15.892 --> 16:17.477
You're better than this!

16:17.519 --> 16:20.563
I know this isn't your ideal
Christmas vacation,

16:20.605 --> 16:21.940
but I signed a contract.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.233
Big deal.
Just blow it off.

16:23.274 --> 16:24.567
We don't "blow things off".

16:24.609 --> 16:26.069
Dad does all the time.

16:26.111 --> 16:27.821
Can we please just go home?

16:27.862 --> 16:28.905
We're staying,

16:28.947 --> 16:30.198
and you and I are doing

16:30.240 --> 16:31.533
every single one of those duties
together.

16:32.784 --> 16:34.953
Yeah. This isn't fair!

16:34.994 --> 16:37.080
I'm supposed to be
snowboarding in Whistler!

16:37.122 --> 16:38.665
Well, now you're spending
your entire Christmas

16:38.707 --> 16:39.833
decorating the lighthouse.

16:39.874 --> 16:40.875
Deal with it.

16:40.917 --> 16:42.544
[grumbles]

16:45.130 --> 16:46.506
[smoke alarm beeping]

16:50.719 --> 16:52.429
Oh, no... oh!

16:53.555 --> 16:55.015
Oh.

16:55.056 --> 16:56.433
[alarm beeping]

16:58.601 --> 16:59.811
Let the holiday fun begin.

17:08.778 --> 17:09.696
[foghorn bellowing]

17:09.738 --> 17:10.822
Ah! What was that?

17:10.864 --> 17:11.698
Are we under attack?

17:11.740 --> 17:12.907
No, of course not!

17:12.949 --> 17:15.160
-[foghorn blasting]
-Oh. Maybe we are!

17:16.077 --> 17:17.954
It's okay, it's done now.

17:17.996 --> 17:19.205
Go back to sleep.

17:23.084 --> 17:24.252
[foghorn bellows]

17:24.294 --> 17:26.546
Are you kidding me?

17:26.588 --> 17:29.299
[groans]

17:29.341 --> 17:32.010
I thought
they just lit up.

17:32.052 --> 17:34.888
[Peter] I'm sure we can close
the whole deal before Christmas.

17:34.929 --> 17:36.181
I'm gonna
have to call you back.

17:36.222 --> 17:37.474
Yeah, I'll get
the paperwork ready.

17:37.515 --> 17:38.808
Yeah, bye.

17:38.850 --> 17:39.934
Howdy, neighbor.

17:39.976 --> 17:41.770
Earl.

17:41.811 --> 17:43.897
What can I do for ya?

17:43.938 --> 17:46.066
Just checking in, see how
you're making out, being back?

17:46.107 --> 17:48.276
Well, it's like
nothing has changed,

17:48.318 --> 17:49.736
except everything has.

17:49.778 --> 17:50.904
Mm-hmm.

17:50.945 --> 17:52.822
Your father, he wanted me to--

17:52.864 --> 17:54.240
Earl.

17:54.282 --> 17:57.160
Look, I-I appreciate
you checking in on me,

17:57.202 --> 17:58.995
but can we just
leave the past alone?

17:59.037 --> 18:00.080
Fair enough.

18:00.121 --> 18:01.790
What are we gonna do about

18:01.831 --> 18:02.957
the new guests
at the lighthouse?

18:02.999 --> 18:05.418
Well, what about 'em?

18:05.460 --> 18:07.879
[laughs] I think they got
more than they bargained for.

18:07.921 --> 18:09.798
[sighs]

18:09.839 --> 18:11.132
Well, then
they should have read

18:11.174 --> 18:12.300
the booking instructions
a little more carefully.

18:12.342 --> 18:14.177
Peter, they need help.

18:14.219 --> 18:16.680
Earl, the reason
I book out the lighthouse

18:16.721 --> 18:17.847
during this time of year

18:17.889 --> 18:19.099
is so that I don't need

18:19.140 --> 18:21.059
to be involved
with the Christmas Festival.

18:21.101 --> 18:22.519
Most folks are really
into the whole thing

18:22.560 --> 18:23.937
without me
getting in the way.

18:23.978 --> 18:25.188
It's not a heavy lift, Peter!

18:25.230 --> 18:27.691
Just give them a hand
to get 'em started.

18:27.732 --> 18:28.942
It's Christmas!

18:28.983 --> 18:30.360
[***]

18:34.698 --> 18:36.032
[***]

18:36.074 --> 18:37.575
Instant coffee...

18:37.617 --> 18:39.411
okay.

18:46.126 --> 18:48.420
Mm! Oh. No.

18:49.462 --> 18:50.880
Hun?

18:50.922 --> 18:53.008
I think I'm gonna go
and get us some breakfast.

18:53.049 --> 18:54.092
Do you want anything?

18:54.134 --> 18:55.135
[Jason]
I'm not hungry!

18:55.176 --> 18:57.303
Okay.

18:59.305 --> 19:04.978
[***]

19:09.149 --> 19:13.653
[***]

19:13.695 --> 19:16.281
House Special
for a special visitor.

19:16.322 --> 19:18.616
[chuckles]
Oh, thank you!

19:18.658 --> 19:20.160
This coffee
is giving me life.

19:20.201 --> 19:21.786
Well, that is what
I like to hear!

19:21.828 --> 19:23.830
[chuckles] Oh, can I get
another one of these to go?

19:23.872 --> 19:25.165
Of course.

19:25.206 --> 19:27.000
My offspring is infuriating me,

19:27.042 --> 19:28.293
but, apparently, I'm still
obligated to feed him.

19:28.335 --> 19:30.920
The challenges of motherhood.

19:30.962 --> 19:32.172
Can I help in any way?

19:32.213 --> 19:35.467
Um... unfortunately, no.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.344
Since his dad and I
got divorced,

19:37.385 --> 19:40.347
he's been taking
everything out on me.

19:40.388 --> 19:41.681
It's been hard.

19:41.723 --> 19:43.558
I'm sorry to hear that, honey.

19:43.600 --> 19:45.185
Just sounds like
he's hurting,

19:45.226 --> 19:47.979
and taking it out
in the wrong ways.

19:48.021 --> 19:50.440
Yeah, tell me about it.

19:50.482 --> 19:53.068
I just really want us to have
a good Christmas together,

19:53.109 --> 19:54.235
but maybe I'm asking
for a miracle.

19:54.277 --> 19:55.987
Well...

19:56.029 --> 19:57.489
Christmas miracles

19:57.530 --> 20:00.241
are what St. Nicholas Island
is known for.

20:00.283 --> 20:01.368
You be patient.

20:01.409 --> 20:03.244
He'll come around.

20:03.286 --> 20:04.913
Thanks.

20:04.954 --> 20:07.040
I just hope bringing him here
wasn't a mistake.

20:07.082 --> 20:09.376
No.

20:11.795 --> 20:14.381
[***]

20:24.182 --> 20:26.226
[lights clattering]

20:26.267 --> 20:28.186
What is this?

20:28.228 --> 20:29.813
This is ridiculous!

20:29.854 --> 20:30.814
This is a mess!

20:30.855 --> 20:33.108
Who would organize it
like this?

20:33.149 --> 20:34.359
I give up.

20:34.401 --> 20:36.653
-[knocking]
-Hey.

20:36.695 --> 20:37.946
Hey.

20:37.987 --> 20:38.905
Jason, right?

20:38.947 --> 20:41.032
-Yeah.
-Peter.

20:41.074 --> 20:43.535
I just, uh, came by to see
how things were going.

20:43.576 --> 20:46.371
Oh, we're just organizing
your mess.

20:46.413 --> 20:48.748
Yeah... sorry about that.
I, um...

20:48.790 --> 20:50.834
I just came by
to give you a hand,

20:50.875 --> 20:52.293
if you need it.

20:52.335 --> 20:53.378
[lights jangling]

20:53.420 --> 20:54.504
We're fine.

20:54.546 --> 20:55.588
Uh, we need it!

20:58.758 --> 21:00.510
Seriously?

21:00.552 --> 21:03.096
How many lights do you need
for this lighthouse?

21:03.138 --> 21:05.432
Well, it's
a pretty big lighthouse.

21:08.059 --> 21:09.144
I found the other box.

21:09.185 --> 21:10.228
Oh, hey, thanks, Jason.

21:10.270 --> 21:11.438
Nice job, man.

21:12.605 --> 21:13.898
Why are you so adamant

21:13.940 --> 21:15.650
about getting
this lighthouse beautified

21:15.692 --> 21:16.651
for the Christmas Festival,

21:16.693 --> 21:18.737
if you don't even
like Christmas?

21:18.778 --> 21:22.240
Well, it's very, very important
to the island, that's why.

21:22.282 --> 21:24.617
Seems to me like you just get
a bunch of naive tourists

21:24.659 --> 21:26.536
to do all the grunt work
for you

21:26.578 --> 21:28.413
so that you don't have
to hire somebody to do it.

21:28.455 --> 21:29.914
Pretty genius scam,
if you ask me.

21:29.956 --> 21:31.166
Mom, stop.

21:31.207 --> 21:33.585
You know,
people actually seek out

21:33.626 --> 21:35.420
the experience
to run a lighthouse

21:35.462 --> 21:36.755
over Christmas Eve.

21:36.796 --> 21:38.923
I think they call it
an "immersive experience".

21:38.965 --> 21:40.592
Uh-huh.

21:40.633 --> 21:42.469
Ah, you're not very trusting,
are you?

21:43.970 --> 21:45.388
That's an understatement.

21:45.430 --> 21:48.516
[scoffs]
I'm a realist, so sue me.

21:48.558 --> 21:49.684
In most small towns,

21:49.726 --> 21:50.727
there's a tree-lighting
ceremony,

21:50.769 --> 21:53.104
where people just gather around

21:53.146 --> 21:54.105
to watch
the tree light up, right?

21:54.147 --> 21:55.690
Okay, well, in this town,

21:55.732 --> 21:58.777
this lighthouse is the tree.

21:58.818 --> 22:01.529
Everyone gathers around
to go watch it light up.

22:01.571 --> 22:03.823
There's carolers,
hot chocolate, there's--

22:03.865 --> 22:06.701
It actually sounds kind of fun,
doesn't it?

22:06.743 --> 22:08.578
Well, it used to be
my favorite day of the year.

22:08.620 --> 22:10.830
"Used to be"?
What happened?

22:10.872 --> 22:12.415
[exhales heavily]

22:12.457 --> 22:14.000
Well, that's a long story.

22:16.961 --> 22:19.005
But, um, come over here.
I want to show you something.

22:20.548 --> 22:22.467
Okay, we don't want
any decorations

22:22.509 --> 22:23.760
to cover this spot, okay?

22:23.802 --> 22:25.387
Otherwise, I get
in lots of trouble.

22:25.428 --> 22:26.638
How come?

22:26.680 --> 22:29.391
Well, apparently,
many, many years ago,

22:29.432 --> 22:31.434
when St. Nicholas
first came to town,

22:31.476 --> 22:33.353
the first thing he did,
when he came to shore,

22:33.395 --> 22:34.979
was kiss this spot, right here,

22:35.021 --> 22:38.316
and thank the lighthouse
for guiding him to safety.

22:38.358 --> 22:40.360
Really? Why?

22:40.402 --> 22:42.070
Well, as legend has it,

22:42.112 --> 22:44.489
the person who kisses this spot
on Christmas Eve

22:44.531 --> 22:47.826
is endowed
with divine direction--

22:47.867 --> 22:50.578
the ability to see
where you're supposed to go.

22:50.620 --> 22:52.372
[Jason] Seems kinda weird.

22:52.414 --> 22:53.665
Does it work?

22:53.707 --> 22:55.250
I don't know.
I've never tried it, myself.

22:55.291 --> 22:57.002
Wait.

22:57.043 --> 23:00.380
You own this lighthouse,
and you've never tried it?

23:00.422 --> 23:02.340
It's just some silly story
to bring tourists

23:02.382 --> 23:04.050
to the island,
that's why.

23:04.092 --> 23:09.347
Well, any more questions,
or are we ready to work?

23:09.389 --> 23:10.390
[Mel exhales with resolve]

23:10.432 --> 23:14.894
[***]

23:16.855 --> 23:18.481
Goes right around there, yeah.

23:18.523 --> 23:20.150
Looking good, guys!

23:20.191 --> 23:24.571
[***]

23:28.408 --> 23:33.038
[***]

23:40.003 --> 23:45.258
[***]

23:47.177 --> 23:49.554
Wow! I cannot believe
that we did it.

23:49.596 --> 23:50.972
It looks amazing!

23:51.014 --> 23:54.351
Not such a shabby
seaside shanty now, huh?

23:54.392 --> 23:56.269
-[chuckles]
-So, what's next?

23:56.311 --> 23:59.022
Well, easy-- you can just
take a long, deserved break,

23:59.064 --> 24:00.023
if you want.

24:00.065 --> 24:01.232
Great job today.

24:01.274 --> 24:02.108
[horn beeps]

24:03.735 --> 24:04.861
Would you look at that!

24:04.903 --> 24:08.198
This hasn't looked this good
in ages.

24:08.239 --> 24:09.783
What a fantastic sight!

24:09.824 --> 24:12.744
Katie, this is Melanie
and her son, Jason.

24:12.786 --> 24:15.246
They just came in from Seattle
yesterday.

24:15.288 --> 24:17.415
[Katie] Oh! Well, welcome.
Welcome to St. Nicholas Island.

24:17.457 --> 24:18.625
Oh, thank you.

24:18.667 --> 24:21.586
This is the great
Katie Cameron, our mayor,

24:21.628 --> 24:22.962
and her lovely daughter, Sara.

24:23.004 --> 24:24.339
[Mel] It's nice
to meet you both.

24:24.381 --> 24:26.091
I hope you're all planning
on coming to tomorrow's

24:26.132 --> 24:28.051
Reindeer Games Carnival
at the community center.

24:28.093 --> 24:29.010
What's that?

24:29.052 --> 24:30.095
Oh, my gosh!

24:30.136 --> 24:31.262
It's an absolute thrill.

24:31.304 --> 24:32.263
We've got Antler Toss,

24:32.305 --> 24:33.932
Santa Limbo,

24:33.973 --> 24:36.267
we have a three-legged race
with a twist--

24:36.309 --> 24:38.019
you name it, we've got it.

24:38.061 --> 24:40.772
We've even got a treasure hunt
for Santa's missing toy sack.

24:40.814 --> 24:42.565
That sounds great!
Jason loves treasure hunts.

24:42.607 --> 24:43.566
Oh, great!

24:43.608 --> 24:46.695
[awkwardly]
I-- no, I-I don't.

24:46.736 --> 24:48.113
[Mel] Yes, you do!

24:48.154 --> 24:49.072
You play that treasure-hunting
game all the time.

24:49.114 --> 24:50.490
-No!
-Yes.

24:50.532 --> 24:52.367
No. I-I haven't played that
in years.

24:52.409 --> 24:53.952
You're crazy.

24:53.993 --> 24:55.787
Am I in <i>the Twilight Zone</i>
right now?

24:55.829 --> 24:57.038
You'll be there,
right, Peter?

24:57.080 --> 24:58.415
Um...

24:58.456 --> 24:59.874
Oh, come on!

24:59.916 --> 25:01.209
You haven't been here
for Christmas in eight years.

25:01.251 --> 25:02.502
You have to come!

25:02.544 --> 25:03.837
As Mayor, I demand it.

25:03.878 --> 25:05.463
Okay, Mom, you can't
force people to come.

25:05.505 --> 25:07.215
Force? No!

25:07.257 --> 25:09.509
Heavily persuade? <i>Yes.</i>

25:09.551 --> 25:11.052
I will do my best, Katie.

25:11.094 --> 25:12.137
[Mel] Yes, me too.

25:12.178 --> 25:13.805
As long as I can convince him
to come.

25:13.847 --> 25:15.390
Hey, Sara still needs
a partner--

25:15.432 --> 25:16.975
-'Kay, no, shh, shh!
...For the three-legged race!

25:17.017 --> 25:18.560
-What? You do! She does.
-I don't.

25:18.601 --> 25:19.644
-I don't.
-[Katie giggles schemingly]

25:19.686 --> 25:21.479
I'll-I'll tell you what, Jason.

25:21.521 --> 25:22.981
I'll go if you go.

25:23.023 --> 25:24.357
What do you say?

25:26.568 --> 25:27.819
Okay.

25:27.861 --> 25:30.030
Ooh! This is gonna be
just wonderful!

25:30.071 --> 25:32.240
-[quietly] Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

25:32.282 --> 25:34.451
You guys are in
for a Christmas to remember.

25:34.492 --> 25:35.702
This is gonna be
just magical.

25:35.744 --> 25:36.703
I can feel it in the air.

25:36.745 --> 25:37.912
Christmas on the island

25:37.954 --> 25:40.081
is like nothing
you will ever experience.

25:40.123 --> 25:41.624
[Peter] Bye, guys.

25:41.666 --> 25:43.209
-Bye! [giggles]
-Bye.

25:43.251 --> 25:44.169
This sounds like fun.

25:44.210 --> 25:45.211
[chuckles]

25:50.258 --> 25:53.553
[***]

25:53.595 --> 25:55.847
[thud]

25:58.683 --> 26:00.852
[***]

26:09.027 --> 26:10.111
Oh!

26:19.162 --> 26:20.663
Ready?

26:20.705 --> 26:22.082
Oh!

26:22.123 --> 26:23.792
Jase, you look so handsome.

26:23.833 --> 26:25.502
Okay.

26:25.543 --> 26:26.795
I'm serious!

26:26.836 --> 26:29.130
You are going to be
the man of the hour.

26:29.172 --> 26:31.466
Mom, stop. Can we go now?

26:31.508 --> 26:33.843
Just let me get one picture
first, please?

26:33.885 --> 26:35.345
Uh, I think
Earl's here, actually.

26:35.387 --> 26:36.554
No, just one photo!

26:36.596 --> 26:40.266
Come on!
Okay, hold on, I'm coming.

26:40.308 --> 26:42.519
Gosh. So fast.

26:42.560 --> 26:45.397
[***]

26:48.900 --> 26:51.361
Wow! This is incredible.

26:51.403 --> 26:52.696
I know.

26:52.737 --> 26:54.531
If anybody can put on
a Christmas party,

26:54.572 --> 26:56.241
it's Katie Cameron.

26:56.282 --> 26:58.284
No kidding,
it's like Whoville in here.

26:58.326 --> 27:00.245
Where's Peter?

27:01.538 --> 27:04.040
He said he'd be here.

27:04.082 --> 27:05.875
If he said it,
he will be.

27:05.917 --> 27:07.127
In the meantime,
you do have me--

27:07.168 --> 27:08.378
your mother,
the one who birthed you.

27:08.420 --> 27:09.295
Remember?

27:09.337 --> 27:11.214
I'm gonna go
get some punch.

27:11.256 --> 27:12.549
[groans]

27:12.590 --> 27:14.217
He's a hard guy
to crack, huh?

27:14.259 --> 27:16.052
Yeah, he's like a cinder block.

27:16.094 --> 27:18.388
* Welcome, welcome! *

27:18.430 --> 27:20.974
Ooh! I'm so glad
you guys actually came.

27:21.016 --> 27:23.143
This is going to be a riot.

27:23.184 --> 27:24.561
Can't you just smell
the Christmas magic in the air?

27:24.602 --> 27:25.812
Absolutely!

27:25.854 --> 27:27.105
-[inhales deeply]
-You've outdone yourself

27:27.147 --> 27:29.357
-again, Katie.
-Oh!

27:29.399 --> 27:31.109
Yes, and your outfit is amazing.
It's very Rudolph-chic.

27:31.151 --> 27:34.112
I was going for
more high-end "Blitzen Boho".

27:34.154 --> 27:35.321
Right. Sorry.
I don't know how I missed that.

27:35.363 --> 27:36.573
[laughter]

27:36.614 --> 27:37.615
-Love the pearls!
-Thank you.

27:37.657 --> 27:38.742
[gasping grandly]

27:38.783 --> 27:40.118
Peter Sanderson,

27:40.160 --> 27:42.370
before my very eyes!

27:42.412 --> 27:43.788
Ooh!

27:43.830 --> 27:45.999
Katie, I'm just
stopping by for a bit,

27:46.041 --> 27:47.375
as I promised Jason.

27:47.417 --> 27:49.002
[Katie] Sure, sure.

27:49.044 --> 27:50.920
All right, I've gotta go
get the first relay started.

27:50.962 --> 27:52.464
Get ready for a showdown!

27:52.505 --> 27:53.840
[laughter]

27:53.882 --> 27:55.717
Well, I'm just here to watch,
not participate.

27:55.759 --> 27:56.634
Oh, me too.

27:56.676 --> 27:57.761
Aw, don't be ridiculous.

27:57.802 --> 27:58.887
If you're here,
you're competing.

27:58.928 --> 28:00.263
No ifs, ands, or buts
about it.

28:00.305 --> 28:02.098
No. Mm-mm! Mmph!

28:04.809 --> 28:08.313
Well, I see my partner.
You two should get out there.

28:09.981 --> 28:11.274
Uh, thanks for coming.

28:11.316 --> 28:13.610
Jason will be really happy
that you showed up.

28:13.651 --> 28:15.862
Well, you guys worked hard
and stepped up yesterday, so,

28:15.904 --> 28:17.530
I had to repay the favor.

28:17.572 --> 28:19.074
[both chuckling]

28:19.115 --> 28:21.701
Ooh!
Shall we try Ruth's cookies?

28:21.743 --> 28:22.911
-Yes, please.
-Yeah? Okay.

28:22.952 --> 28:25.455
[***]

28:25.497 --> 28:26.581
Oh!

28:26.623 --> 28:28.375
So-- uh, I'm so sorry.

28:28.416 --> 28:30.126
It's okay!
You barely even got me.

28:30.168 --> 28:32.003
If it was grape juice,
it would be a whole other story.

28:32.045 --> 28:33.755
I shouldn't have
spun around so quickly.

28:33.797 --> 28:34.839
Can-- Can I do something?

28:34.881 --> 28:36.132
Get some baking soda
or something?

28:36.174 --> 28:37.509
It's fine, you don't
need to get anything.

28:37.550 --> 28:38.343
It's fine. It's fine.

28:38.385 --> 28:40.887
Well, actually...

28:40.929 --> 28:43.056
you could be my partner
for the relay race.

28:43.098 --> 28:44.891
My mom's making me participate
in all the games.

28:44.933 --> 28:45.767
Really?

28:45.809 --> 28:47.102
If you want to?

28:47.143 --> 28:49.437
Yeah, def-definitely.
Yes. Yeah.

28:49.479 --> 28:51.064
Great! Come on.

28:52.273 --> 28:54.651
Welcome!
Welcome, everyone.

28:54.693 --> 28:59.072
What a special evening this is,
to see so many familiar faces!

28:59.114 --> 29:00.990
And some new ones as well.

29:01.032 --> 29:02.534
As most of you know,

29:02.575 --> 29:04.661
the Reindeer Games
is a cherished tradition,

29:04.703 --> 29:07.080
where each team competes
in different challenges.

29:07.122 --> 29:10.792
The winners will take home
the coveted Reindeer Trophy!

29:10.834 --> 29:12.210
[cheering]

29:12.252 --> 29:13.253
Whoo!

29:13.294 --> 29:16.006
So, without further ado,

29:16.047 --> 29:17.632
let's get this show on the road,
shall we?

29:17.674 --> 29:20.844
And let the Christmas spirit
guide you... to victory!

29:20.885 --> 29:22.429
[hearty laughter
and cheering]

29:22.470 --> 29:24.681
[***]

29:24.723 --> 29:26.641
[cheering]

29:29.894 --> 29:32.522
[***]

29:32.564 --> 29:34.065
Come on!

29:35.025 --> 29:37.068
Ahh!

29:37.110 --> 29:39.195
[laughter and cheering]

29:41.948 --> 29:44.200
-[cheering]
-Whoo!

29:44.242 --> 29:45.243
You can do it.
Come on!

29:45.285 --> 29:46.870
Yeah!

29:46.911 --> 29:48.580
[cheering]

29:48.621 --> 29:51.833
[***]

29:54.044 --> 29:56.463
[cheering]

29:58.173 --> 30:01.426
[***]

30:05.430 --> 30:07.599
[crowd] Ohh!

30:08.933 --> 30:11.436
Down, down, down.

30:11.478 --> 30:12.687
[laughter]

30:12.729 --> 30:13.813
[cheering]

30:13.855 --> 30:15.106
Okay.

30:18.651 --> 30:20.612
[***]

30:24.199 --> 30:26.618
[***]

30:27.786 --> 30:28.703
Yes!

30:31.206 --> 30:33.792
[***]

30:34.959 --> 30:36.670
Are you ready? Yeah?

30:36.711 --> 30:39.214
Okay, if we win this,
we could get the trophy.

30:39.255 --> 30:40.840
Oh, "Snowball"
is my middle name.

30:40.882 --> 30:41.966
Okay.

30:42.008 --> 30:43.551
It's not, it's Marie,

30:43.593 --> 30:45.762
but "Melanie Snowball Dalton"
has a really nice ring to it.

30:45.804 --> 30:47.305
It does have
a nice ring to it.

30:47.347 --> 30:48.765
-Yeah.
-"Snowball-Dalton".

30:48.807 --> 30:50.725
Okay, everyone--
last challenge!

30:50.767 --> 30:52.727
We currently have a tie

30:52.769 --> 30:53.978
between Sara and Jason,

30:54.020 --> 30:55.522
and Melanie and Peter!

30:55.563 --> 30:57.107
Okay.

30:57.148 --> 30:58.942
On the count of "Blitzen"--

30:58.983 --> 31:00.193
on Dasher, on Dancer,

31:00.235 --> 31:01.444
on Prancer, and Vixen...

31:01.486 --> 31:03.113
on Comet, on Cupid,
on Donner,

31:03.154 --> 31:05.532
on Blitzen!

31:05.573 --> 31:07.951
[***]

31:07.992 --> 31:09.244
Here we go.

31:10.704 --> 31:14.249
[***]

31:14.290 --> 31:16.418
Come on, one more!
One more now!

31:19.087 --> 31:20.338
Last one.

31:20.380 --> 31:21.381
What?

31:21.423 --> 31:23.174
-We did it!
-Time's up!

31:23.216 --> 31:24.259
[cheering]

31:24.300 --> 31:25.969
What the heck?
What was that?

31:26.011 --> 31:27.721
[Katie] They've done it!

31:27.762 --> 31:31.224
They've really done it!
Not a single marshmallow missed!

31:31.266 --> 31:32.976
And with that,

31:33.018 --> 31:34.310
it gives me great pleasure
to announce

31:34.352 --> 31:36.312
this year's winners
of the Reindeer Games--

31:36.354 --> 31:39.149
Jason Dalton
and Sara Cameron!

31:39.190 --> 31:42.444
[wild cheering]

31:42.485 --> 31:43.445
Whoo!

31:47.323 --> 31:48.867
Complete nepotism,
if you ask me.

31:48.908 --> 31:49.993
Yeah, it is,

31:50.035 --> 31:51.077
but I think the adult thing

31:51.119 --> 31:52.620
is to probably
let them have it, huh?

31:52.662 --> 31:54.831
Yeah, we could start a petition
and protest their victory.

31:54.873 --> 31:56.499
Ooh, City Hall
tomorrow morning?

31:56.541 --> 31:58.209
You bring the megaphone,
I'll bring the signs.

31:58.251 --> 32:00.712
Deal. I always wanted to start
a Reindeer Games revolt.

32:00.754 --> 32:01.796
-[laughing] Yeah!
-Yeah?

32:01.838 --> 32:03.256
[laughter]

32:04.591 --> 32:07.010
Thanks, for that.

32:07.052 --> 32:08.511
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

32:08.553 --> 32:09.637
[scoffs]

32:09.679 --> 32:10.847
You know...

32:10.889 --> 32:12.849
if you didn't come,
he wouldn't have come,

32:12.891 --> 32:14.851
and I haven't seen him
have this much fun in years.

32:14.893 --> 32:16.186
Well, I wish I could

32:16.227 --> 32:17.354
take all the credit
for him being here,

32:17.395 --> 32:19.147
but I don't think
I was the only one

32:19.189 --> 32:22.150
that convinced him
to come.

32:22.192 --> 32:24.027
Young love, hmm?

32:24.069 --> 32:24.903
The best kind.

32:26.071 --> 32:27.489
Okay, everyone!

32:27.530 --> 32:28.948
Who wants to do another round
of Christmas Limbo,

32:28.990 --> 32:30.033
just for the heck of it?

32:30.075 --> 32:31.284
Okay!

32:31.326 --> 32:32.869
-Let's do it.
-They do.

32:32.911 --> 32:34.871
Come on! Line up.
Come on.

32:34.913 --> 32:37.207
Let's do this!

32:37.248 --> 32:39.709
[***]

32:39.751 --> 32:41.002
[cheering]

32:44.464 --> 32:46.132
Whoo!

32:46.174 --> 32:48.426
[Katie] There we go.

32:48.468 --> 32:49.427
Whoo!

32:49.469 --> 32:50.595
Yeah!

32:55.975 --> 32:58.436
[***]

33:02.148 --> 33:03.400
Who are you,

33:03.441 --> 33:05.068
and what have you done
with my mother?

33:05.110 --> 33:06.569
It's called cooking,

33:06.611 --> 33:08.905
and I heard
it's really popular these days.

33:08.947 --> 33:11.241
Ruth gave me
her famous pancake recipe.

33:11.282 --> 33:13.993
[dubiously] Uh-huh.

33:14.035 --> 33:15.412
What are you reading?

33:15.453 --> 33:17.247
It's <i>The Beginner's Guide</i>
<i>to Morse Code.</i>

33:17.288 --> 33:19.666
Found it
in a box of decorations.

33:19.708 --> 33:21.751
Wow. That's kind of amazing.

33:21.793 --> 33:23.253
And I actually found
a newspaper clipping

33:23.294 --> 33:24.671
inside the book

33:24.713 --> 33:26.089
about a small boat
that capsized,

33:26.131 --> 33:27.382
and then,

33:27.424 --> 33:28.758
the old lighthouse keeper,
Hal Sanderson,

33:28.800 --> 33:31.177
detected it
and saved all the men on board.

33:31.219 --> 33:32.887
I have a feeling
that this lighthouse

33:32.929 --> 33:35.598
has a lot more history
than we realize,

33:35.640 --> 33:37.559
and we're really lucky
to be staying in it.

33:37.600 --> 33:39.269
What if I did my paper on it?

33:39.310 --> 33:40.228
That's a great idea!

33:40.270 --> 33:41.271
Really?

33:41.312 --> 33:42.647
Yes!

33:42.689 --> 33:44.065
Do you think Peter
would let me interview him?

33:45.066 --> 33:46.276
That is genius.

33:46.317 --> 33:47.777
This is gonna be
the best paper ever.

33:47.819 --> 33:49.446
-Thanks, Mom.
-You know what?

33:49.487 --> 33:51.156
Peter's already here
fixing some lights,

33:51.197 --> 33:52.741
and I think I saw
some more stuff

33:52.782 --> 33:54.200
on the second floor
of the lighthouse.

33:54.242 --> 33:55.744
I'm gonna go
grab it for you.

33:57.328 --> 33:59.622
[***]

34:02.917 --> 34:04.210
Hey.

34:04.252 --> 34:06.129
Hey, you need any help?

34:06.171 --> 34:07.505
-No, I'm okay.
-Are you sure?

34:07.547 --> 34:09.716
[wheezing]

34:09.758 --> 34:11.259
-Don't just stand there.
-Okay, okay.

34:11.301 --> 34:12.510
Just relax and breathe.

34:12.552 --> 34:14.220
This is not a yoga class.

34:14.262 --> 34:15.638
Turn around
and walk down backwards.

34:15.680 --> 34:17.515
Yeah, that's it.
Good, good.

34:17.557 --> 34:18.558
Okay, I'm gonna walk up
and help you, okay?

34:18.600 --> 34:20.560
-[snaps] Give me space!
-Okay.

34:22.187 --> 34:23.229
Whoa! [gasps]

34:25.940 --> 34:27.150
Thank you.

34:27.192 --> 34:28.651
No problem.

34:28.693 --> 34:29.903
[smoke alarm beeps]

34:29.944 --> 34:30.820
[gasps] Oh...

34:30.862 --> 34:32.322
[Jason]
Mom! Smoke alarm!

34:32.364 --> 34:33.990
There goes breakfast.

34:34.032 --> 34:35.992
[beeping]

34:41.206 --> 34:44.000
So... you want to do a paper
on the lighthouse,

34:44.042 --> 34:45.794
and you want
to interview me about it?

34:45.835 --> 34:47.045
You grew up here,
didn't you?

34:47.087 --> 34:48.004
I did.

34:49.130 --> 34:50.006
With my dad.

34:51.257 --> 34:52.258
So, will you do it?

34:54.886 --> 34:56.262
Come on, please?

34:56.304 --> 34:58.556
It would really help.

34:59.724 --> 35:01.184
Okay, I guess I'll do it.

35:01.226 --> 35:02.185
[relieved laugh]

35:03.395 --> 35:04.646
You sound so enthusiastic.

35:04.688 --> 35:06.690
Just a lot of history there,
is all.

35:06.731 --> 35:08.817
Exactly. That's why
he wants to do a paper on it.

35:08.858 --> 35:10.360
I said I'd do it,
snarky-pants.

35:10.402 --> 35:11.903
I'm "snarky-pants"?

35:13.071 --> 35:14.197
All right.

35:14.239 --> 35:16.032
So what do you want to know?

35:17.242 --> 35:18.618
Well...

35:18.660 --> 35:20.912
[***]

35:25.000 --> 35:27.460
My buddy and I carved our names
in here when we were kids.

35:27.502 --> 35:28.878
[chuckles]

35:28.920 --> 35:31.756
And now he runs the water taxi.

35:31.798 --> 35:33.216
Cool.

35:33.258 --> 35:35.093
[chuckles] Yeah.

35:35.135 --> 35:37.345
So... is this you?

35:39.764 --> 35:41.474
Yeah. Where did you find that?

35:41.516 --> 35:44.102
Uh, my mom found it here
the other day.

35:44.144 --> 35:45.937
Is that your dad with you?

35:46.855 --> 35:48.440
[sighs] Yeah, that's Harold.

35:48.481 --> 35:50.150
Everyone called him Hal.

35:50.191 --> 35:51.443
Wait a minute. "Hal".

35:51.484 --> 35:52.777
He's the one
from the newspaper clippings.

35:52.819 --> 35:54.404
He saved all those people.

35:54.446 --> 35:56.197
It would be so cool
to meet him.

35:56.239 --> 35:59.117
Yeah, he passed, uh,
about seven years ago, now.

36:00.577 --> 36:02.162
[sighs] I'm sorry.

36:02.203 --> 36:03.621
Nah, it's okay.

36:03.663 --> 36:06.750
He was a good man, yeah,
but we had a tough relationship.

36:07.709 --> 36:08.835
Do you miss him?

36:09.836 --> 36:11.129
Yeah.

36:11.171 --> 36:12.422
Every day.

36:12.464 --> 36:13.798
Especially this time of year.

36:13.840 --> 36:15.675
I miss my dad, too.

36:15.717 --> 36:18.428
It's been a year
since he left to be with Laura.

36:18.470 --> 36:20.930
Sometimes, I think
he's forgotten about me.

36:20.972 --> 36:21.806
No, hey.

36:21.848 --> 36:24.976
Let me tell you something, okay?

36:25.018 --> 36:26.936
Now, I just met you
three days ago

36:26.978 --> 36:30.148
and I already know for a fact
that you are one special kid.

36:30.190 --> 36:32.150
There's no way
your dad's forgotten about you.

36:32.192 --> 36:34.361
Not possible, you hear me?

36:34.402 --> 36:35.904
Okay.

36:35.945 --> 36:37.781
Hey, your--
your mom told me

36:37.822 --> 36:39.616
that you're reading
a book on Morse code?

36:39.657 --> 36:40.617
Is that right?

36:40.658 --> 36:41.701
Yeah. Yeah, I found it.

36:41.743 --> 36:43.620
-You know that's my book?
-Really?

36:43.661 --> 36:45.622
I used to love
to send messages to boats

36:45.663 --> 36:47.123
using the signal light.

36:47.165 --> 36:48.291
Cool!

36:48.333 --> 36:49.292
You want to take a look?

36:49.334 --> 36:50.710
-Yeah.
-All right.

36:51.628 --> 36:53.296
All right.

36:53.338 --> 36:54.547
[click]

36:54.589 --> 36:57.300
All right.

36:57.342 --> 37:00.095
[click, clack-click]

37:00.136 --> 37:01.638
[clack-click]

37:01.680 --> 37:03.473
"H" is four dots.

37:03.515 --> 37:04.808
[clack-clunk]

37:04.849 --> 37:06.643
So what are you sending?

37:06.685 --> 37:08.645
"Happy Holidays."

37:08.687 --> 37:10.689
That's so cool.

37:11.690 --> 37:12.816
You wanna give it a try?

37:12.857 --> 37:13.983
-Yeah.
-All right.

37:14.025 --> 37:16.820
Over here.
Hop in there.

37:17.737 --> 37:18.863
That's it.

37:18.905 --> 37:20.323
And you just hold
your hand there,

37:20.365 --> 37:22.534
and open it up.

37:22.575 --> 37:25.161
[clacking and clicking]

37:25.203 --> 37:26.746
Mm! Hmm?

37:28.039 --> 37:30.834
Best candycane cake-pop
ever, right?

37:31.876 --> 37:33.878
Definitely top three.

37:33.920 --> 37:35.547
I told you.
What do you think?

37:35.588 --> 37:36.506
Mm, yes.

37:36.548 --> 37:37.716
Yeah?

37:37.757 --> 37:39.843
This is the Rolls-Royce
of cake pops.

37:39.884 --> 37:41.720
Wait, are you patronizing me?

37:41.761 --> 37:42.721
No. Never.
I would never think of it.

37:42.762 --> 37:44.514
Oh, right.

37:44.556 --> 37:45.807
Jason!

37:45.849 --> 37:47.058
[Jason] Oh...

37:47.100 --> 37:48.226
hi!

37:48.268 --> 37:49.686
They're lighting fireworks
at the harbor.

37:49.728 --> 37:50.603
Do you want to come with us?

37:50.645 --> 37:51.980
Yeah. If it's okay

37:52.022 --> 37:53.523
-with you, Mom?
-Um...

37:53.565 --> 37:54.858
hmm.

37:54.899 --> 37:56.693
Okay, fine, but you need
to come straight back

37:56.735 --> 37:57.569
to the lighthouse after.

37:57.610 --> 37:58.695
Deal.

37:58.737 --> 38:00.488
-Hey!
-[laughing]

38:00.530 --> 38:01.614
This one's mine, sorry.

38:01.656 --> 38:03.158
[chuckling]

38:03.199 --> 38:06.036
I can't thank you enough
for helping him with his paper,

38:06.077 --> 38:08.455
getting him out of
his angsty teenage shell.

38:08.496 --> 38:10.415
I think
he really looks up to you.

38:10.457 --> 38:13.209
Hmm. It's no problem at all.
I'm just happy to help.

38:13.251 --> 38:15.045
And I want to say sorry

38:15.086 --> 38:18.131
for coming off a little strong
the first day--

38:18.173 --> 38:19.132
Mm?

38:19.174 --> 38:21.176
I do take a little time
to trust,

38:21.217 --> 38:22.969
and I thought
that you were scamming us, so.

38:23.011 --> 38:25.805
Scamming you? Okay. Well...

38:25.847 --> 38:27.474
I wasn't the most welcoming,

38:27.515 --> 38:28.933
so I apologize for that, too,

38:28.975 --> 38:32.645
and it was my first Christmas
back since, uh...

38:32.687 --> 38:33.980
[inhales sharply]

38:34.022 --> 38:35.565
Your dad?

38:35.607 --> 38:36.775
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

38:36.816 --> 38:38.693
I'm sorry. Was it sudden?

38:38.735 --> 38:40.612
It was, yeah.

38:40.653 --> 38:42.906
You know
what the worst part was?

38:42.947 --> 38:44.824
The last time I talked to him,

38:44.866 --> 38:48.495
I told him how much
I just didn't wanna be like him.

38:48.536 --> 38:51.748
Didn't want to end up
on this small, boring island

38:51.790 --> 38:53.375
for the rest of my life.

38:53.416 --> 38:56.544
Instead I wanted, you know,
to go pursue a bigger life,

38:56.586 --> 38:59.339
but I wasn't here for him
when he needed me the most.

38:59.381 --> 39:01.800
That's not your fault.
You couldn't have known.

39:02.967 --> 39:05.845
Yeah, but it doesn't
take away from the guilt, so.

39:05.887 --> 39:08.098
Oh, I know all about that.

39:08.139 --> 39:10.100
Jason still blames me
for the divorce.

39:10.141 --> 39:12.686
He thinks
that it was my fault.

39:12.727 --> 39:14.396
Maybe it was.
I don't know.

39:14.437 --> 39:17.190
Well, I mean, it takes two
to have a relationship.

39:17.232 --> 39:19.192
Some things
don't last forever, you know?

39:20.193 --> 39:22.028
The thing
that's really weird is...

39:22.070 --> 39:24.531
all the Christmas
family traditions

39:24.572 --> 39:26.241
that we don't
do together anymore.

39:26.282 --> 39:27.492
Hmm.

39:27.534 --> 39:29.369
Jason used to love decorating
a Christmas tree

39:29.411 --> 39:32.205
and listening
to Christmas carols and...

39:32.247 --> 39:33.623
stuff like that.

39:33.665 --> 39:35.458
Well, I mean,

39:35.500 --> 39:38.628
I could always get you guys
a tree, if you want?

39:38.670 --> 39:40.296
Maybe even help you decorate it.

39:40.338 --> 39:41.798
I thought you were
allergic to Christmas?

39:41.840 --> 39:43.633
I think I'll survive.

39:43.675 --> 39:46.011
[chuckling]

39:46.052 --> 39:47.512
Okay.

39:47.554 --> 39:49.097
That would be great.

39:49.139 --> 39:51.474
Yeah.

39:52.809 --> 39:54.269
[Jason]
So where are we going?

39:54.310 --> 39:57.063
To watch the fireworks from
the best spot on the island.

39:58.064 --> 40:00.358
Cool.

40:01.609 --> 40:03.069
Come on.

40:03.111 --> 40:04.654
I have a better spot for us.

40:04.696 --> 40:07.240
[***]

40:08.700 --> 40:10.535
Here it is.

40:13.747 --> 40:14.914
Thank you.

40:15.749 --> 40:16.708
Okay.

40:16.750 --> 40:18.335
Here.

40:18.376 --> 40:19.586
Okay.

40:22.005 --> 40:22.881
So whose boat is it?

40:22.922 --> 40:24.591
My parents'.

40:24.632 --> 40:26.509
It's pretty cool.
Do you drive it?

40:26.551 --> 40:27.886
Mm-hmm. My dad taught me,

40:27.927 --> 40:29.679
but I'm not allowed
to take it out in the winter

40:29.721 --> 40:31.806
because it gets too choppy.

40:31.848 --> 40:33.933
Does your dad live
with you and your mom?

40:35.393 --> 40:36.686
Yeah, of course. Why?

40:36.728 --> 40:38.521
It's nothing.

40:38.563 --> 40:40.357
You're just lucky.

40:40.398 --> 40:41.983
I'd give anything to go back
to the way things were

40:42.025 --> 40:43.026
before the divorce.

40:44.861 --> 40:47.030
I'm sorry.

40:47.072 --> 40:49.115
And ever since
my dad met his new girlfriend,

40:49.157 --> 40:51.034
he's barely had time for me.

40:51.076 --> 40:53.203
Sometimes, I wish
he'd just break up with her.

40:53.244 --> 40:54.871
Why did your mom and dad
get divorced, anyway?

40:54.913 --> 40:57.707
Mom was working all the time.

40:57.749 --> 41:00.377
It just ruined everything.

41:00.418 --> 41:02.837
Sorry. I don't know why
I'm telling you all this.

41:02.879 --> 41:04.506
It's okay.

41:05.924 --> 41:07.092
Are you hungry?

41:07.133 --> 41:08.385
Yeah.

41:08.426 --> 41:10.970
My dad usually keeps snacks
in the tackle box.

41:11.805 --> 41:13.556
Okay.

41:16.935 --> 41:18.311
Do you want a candy cane?

41:18.353 --> 41:19.312
Definitely.

41:19.354 --> 41:20.522
[giggling]

41:24.943 --> 41:26.152
I'm glad you're here.

41:26.194 --> 41:27.570
Me too.

41:27.612 --> 41:29.614
[fireworks popping]

41:30.907 --> 41:33.243
Come on, move over.

41:33.284 --> 41:35.620
[***]

41:39.708 --> 41:42.293
[booming and crackling]

41:45.588 --> 41:47.632
[Mel] Wow. It's so beautiful.

41:47.674 --> 41:49.342
I have to admit--

41:49.384 --> 41:51.553
St. Nicholas
sure has its moments.

41:55.473 --> 41:58.476
[phone begins ringing]

41:59.978 --> 42:02.105
Sorry. I have to take this.

42:03.189 --> 42:04.441
Hello?

42:07.110 --> 42:09.237
[fireworks popping]

42:15.243 --> 42:17.120
Okay, so this is a test,

42:17.162 --> 42:18.955
and if you fail,

42:18.997 --> 42:21.291
I don't think
we can be friends.

42:21.332 --> 42:22.792
Those are
some pretty high stakes!

42:22.834 --> 42:24.294
Well, around here,

42:24.336 --> 42:26.504
we take our Christmas treats
very seriously.

42:26.546 --> 42:28.631
I'd say you guys take
everything about Christmas

42:28.673 --> 42:29.799
very seriously.

42:29.841 --> 42:32.344
[laughs]
Yeah, we definitely do.

42:32.385 --> 42:34.179
So what's the test?

42:34.220 --> 42:37.390
So, every year, Ruth makes
two Christmas drinks

42:37.432 --> 42:38.641
and the Island is split
over which one's better--

42:38.683 --> 42:39.976
Cinnamon Eggnog

42:40.018 --> 42:41.102
or Peppermint Hot Chocolate.

42:41.144 --> 42:42.395
They both
sound pretty good to me.

42:42.437 --> 42:44.314
No. You have to choose one.

42:44.356 --> 42:47.275
I need to know if you're with me
or against me.

42:47.317 --> 42:48.735
You really have a flare
for the dramatic.

42:48.777 --> 42:50.278
You have no idea.

42:51.821 --> 42:54.199
All right, here we go.

42:55.408 --> 42:56.868
Well?

42:56.910 --> 42:58.119
Hmm. Interesting.

42:58.161 --> 42:59.329
"Interesting"?

42:59.371 --> 43:00.330
I can't let you know
which way

43:00.372 --> 43:01.706
-I'm leaning.
-Okay.

43:04.417 --> 43:05.502
Okay.

43:05.543 --> 43:07.087
That's fantastic.
Definitely this one.

43:07.128 --> 43:09.339
The Peppermint Hot Chocolate
is my favorite.

43:09.381 --> 43:11.925
We can now "officially"
be friends.

43:11.966 --> 43:13.051
Glad I passed the test.

43:13.093 --> 43:14.552
I was nervous there
for a minute.

43:14.594 --> 43:15.595
Me too.

43:17.055 --> 43:18.890
So... what's the deal?

43:18.932 --> 43:21.017
How did you and your mom
end up here for the holidays?

43:21.059 --> 43:22.185
It's a bit of a story.

43:22.227 --> 43:23.186
I was supposed
to go snowboarding

43:23.228 --> 43:24.979
with my dad in Whistler,

43:25.021 --> 43:26.606
but he canceled
last-minute.

43:26.648 --> 43:29.859
So... my mom
booked us a trip here.

43:29.901 --> 43:32.404
Wow. That's pretty cool of her.

43:32.445 --> 43:33.738
What?

43:33.780 --> 43:35.115
Well, obviously,
she knew you'd be upset,

43:35.156 --> 43:36.700
so she scrambled to book
something last-minute,

43:36.741 --> 43:38.493
so you'd still have
something special.

43:38.535 --> 43:39.869
Do you have any idea
how hard it is

43:39.911 --> 43:41.329
to book something
at Christmas?

43:41.371 --> 43:42.747
-Not really.
-Okay, well,

43:42.789 --> 43:44.040
it's basically impossible.

43:44.082 --> 43:45.625
She's pretty cool.

43:46.918 --> 43:49.295
Yeah. I guess.

43:52.090 --> 43:53.091
[Sara laughs]

43:53.133 --> 43:54.426
What?

43:54.467 --> 43:56.511
You have whipped cream
all over your face!

43:56.553 --> 43:57.637
You've got some
on your face, too.

43:57.679 --> 43:58.680
No.

43:58.722 --> 44:00.098
No!

44:00.140 --> 44:02.517
[laughing]

44:07.731 --> 44:08.857
[sighs happily]

44:08.898 --> 44:10.442
How good does this look?

44:10.483 --> 44:11.651
I feel like we're in

44:11.693 --> 44:13.445
a giant Christmas
snow globe right now.

44:13.486 --> 44:15.613
You're starting to sound
like Mayor Katie.

44:15.655 --> 44:17.907
Hey, you two are getting
into the Christmas spirit.

44:17.949 --> 44:19.159
Just admit it.

44:19.200 --> 44:20.368
Uh, just a little.

44:20.410 --> 44:21.494
Maybe a tiny bit.

44:21.536 --> 44:23.621
Oh, just a little bit? Yeah?

44:23.663 --> 44:26.958
Um, I am starting to decorate
back at the house a bit.

44:27.000 --> 44:28.918
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

44:30.545 --> 44:32.130
Well, thanks
for picking this up.

44:32.172 --> 44:33.590
It wouldn't be Christmas

44:33.631 --> 44:35.133
without decorating
a big Christmas tree.

44:35.175 --> 44:36.676
Well, you're welcome.

44:36.718 --> 44:39.346
Oh! Actually...
this is your mail.

44:39.387 --> 44:41.389
This big pile here.

44:41.431 --> 44:43.391
Oh. I'll, uh,
I'll just grab that.

44:43.433 --> 44:44.934
Yeah. [chuckles]

44:44.976 --> 44:46.353
[inhales]

44:46.394 --> 44:49.522
[***]

44:51.149 --> 44:52.442
Everything okay?

44:53.401 --> 44:54.778
Oh, yeah. I, uh...

44:54.819 --> 44:57.864
just got a postcard
from an old relative here.

44:57.906 --> 44:58.823
Oh.

44:58.865 --> 45:00.617
Okay, um...

45:00.658 --> 45:02.827
I'm gonna go upstairs
and grab a couple of things,

45:02.869 --> 45:05.580
but I will see you tonight
at Ruth's...

45:05.622 --> 45:08.958
"pre-Christmas"
uh, decorating party?

45:09.000 --> 45:10.669
[Peter] Yeah, we gotta put
the finishing touches

45:10.710 --> 45:12.253
on Town Square.

45:12.295 --> 45:14.506
Well, pal, things are looking
pretty good around here, huh?

45:14.547 --> 45:16.174
Yeah.

45:16.216 --> 45:18.343
You're so lucky
to own this place.

45:18.385 --> 45:21.304
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

45:21.346 --> 45:23.431
Sometimes, I forget that,

45:23.473 --> 45:24.808
but you and your mom

45:24.849 --> 45:27.143
have really made me
appreciate it lately,

45:27.185 --> 45:28.478
so thank you.

45:29.646 --> 45:31.189
Look, I'm, uh,
I'm gonna get going,

45:31.231 --> 45:32.273
but I'm gonna see you
tonight, right?

45:32.315 --> 45:33.983
Yeah. Sara invited me.

45:35.235 --> 45:37.612
Whoa! Sara invited you?

45:37.654 --> 45:39.906
You are really starting
to click, huh?

45:39.948 --> 45:41.700
Yeah, but...

45:41.741 --> 45:43.326
I think
I'm in the "friend zone".

45:43.368 --> 45:45.245
A wise man once told me

45:45.286 --> 45:47.997
the best kind of 'ship
is a friendship.

45:49.374 --> 45:50.542
I-- [stammers]

45:50.583 --> 45:51.793
Forget I said that.

45:51.835 --> 45:53.169
Not so good, right?

45:53.211 --> 45:55.213
Yeah, well, okay.

45:55.255 --> 45:56.798
Do you have a girlfriend?

45:56.840 --> 45:58.925
Oh, no. No.

45:58.967 --> 46:01.928
I've been a lone wolf
for the past couple years, so.

46:01.970 --> 46:04.055
Don't worry.

46:04.097 --> 46:05.890
You're cool.
You'll find someone.

46:05.932 --> 46:08.643
[chuckles] Thanks.

46:08.685 --> 46:10.353
Thanks a lot, pal,
I appreciate that.

46:10.395 --> 46:11.438
All right,
we'll see you tonight.

46:11.479 --> 46:13.398
-See you.
-Yeah.

46:14.816 --> 46:16.860
[***]

46:18.570 --> 46:20.363
Oh, cool.
You brought our stockings?

46:20.405 --> 46:21.531
Of course, I did!

46:21.573 --> 46:23.074
It wouldn't be Christmas
without them.

46:24.576 --> 46:26.745
I always loved these.

46:27.912 --> 46:29.247
Me too. You know,

46:29.289 --> 46:31.207
I made them just a couple months
after you were born.

46:31.249 --> 46:33.126
Seriously?

46:33.168 --> 46:34.836
Don't act so surprised!

46:34.878 --> 46:37.505
My mom always
made Christmas really special

46:37.547 --> 46:38.631
when I was a kid,

46:38.673 --> 46:40.550
so I wanted to do
the same for you.

46:41.718 --> 46:44.346
I guess you do a lot of things
I don't see.

46:44.387 --> 46:46.389
It's kind of what moms do.

46:46.431 --> 46:48.391
You mean the world to me.

46:48.433 --> 46:49.768
You know that, right?

46:51.144 --> 46:52.228
It's hard to believe

46:52.270 --> 46:53.688
this is the first Christmas

46:53.730 --> 46:55.231
we won't all be together
as a family.

46:55.273 --> 46:57.317
I know. [sighs]

46:57.359 --> 46:59.402
And it is hard,

46:59.444 --> 47:02.530
but maybe it's time
for some new traditions.

47:02.572 --> 47:04.407
I mean, honestly,
being here with you

47:04.449 --> 47:06.785
is the most fun
I've had at Christmas in years.

47:06.826 --> 47:08.161
Me too.

47:08.203 --> 47:09.579
[chuckles]

47:09.621 --> 47:12.207
Okay, well, I better get ready.

47:12.248 --> 47:13.166
It's almost time to go.

47:13.208 --> 47:14.584
Yeah.

47:14.626 --> 47:15.627
I'll meet you down there.

47:15.669 --> 47:16.711
'Kay.

47:24.969 --> 47:26.054
Mom?

47:26.096 --> 47:27.347
Yeah?

47:27.389 --> 47:29.307
Thanks...

47:29.349 --> 47:32.143
for doing all that stuff
that I don't see.

47:34.270 --> 47:36.606
Any time.

47:44.280 --> 47:46.866
[chuckles quietly]

47:46.908 --> 47:49.828
[***]

47:49.869 --> 47:52.330
* Jingle bells
jingle bells *

47:52.372 --> 47:55.000
* Jingle all the way *

47:55.041 --> 47:57.252
* Oh, what fun it is to ride in
a one-horse, open sleigh... *

47:57.293 --> 47:58.503
Go ahead.

47:58.545 --> 48:00.171
Thanks, Mom.

48:00.213 --> 48:01.631
* ...Jingle bells
jingle bells... *

48:01.673 --> 48:03.008
Hi!

48:03.049 --> 48:04.634
All right, everyone,
we've got a lot of work to do,

48:04.676 --> 48:05.844
so, grab an old friend,

48:05.885 --> 48:07.637
or make a new one,
and let's get going!

48:07.679 --> 48:10.306
Snow machine over there,
movie center over there,

48:10.348 --> 48:12.142
and on lights
and decorations--

48:12.183 --> 48:13.560
we want those
everywhere, okay?

48:13.601 --> 48:15.437
And let's have some fun!

48:15.478 --> 48:17.230
Hit it, Earl!

48:17.272 --> 48:19.899
[***]

48:29.075 --> 48:33.663
[***]

48:39.210 --> 48:44.299
[***]

48:46.217 --> 48:47.344
Ha!

48:47.385 --> 48:48.303
[startled] Oh!

48:50.221 --> 48:52.015
Got ya.

48:52.057 --> 48:54.559
[***]

49:01.566 --> 49:03.318
How's it going?

49:03.360 --> 49:04.778
Pretty good.

49:04.819 --> 49:07.280
I think I'm getting
the "hang" of it.

49:07.322 --> 49:08.698
[both chuckling]

49:09.824 --> 49:11.618
And how are things going
at the lighthouse?

49:11.659 --> 49:14.329
I know it was a bit of a shock
when you first arrived.

49:14.371 --> 49:16.831
Yeah, you know, I'm actually
kind of loving it now.

49:16.873 --> 49:18.375
It's a little cramped
with a teenager--

49:18.416 --> 49:19.918
Mm.

49:19.959 --> 49:21.419
But Jason and I are spending
a lot of time together,

49:21.461 --> 49:22.837
and it's really amazing,

49:22.879 --> 49:25.465
and Peter's been really helpful.

49:25.507 --> 49:27.008
Jason really likes him.

49:27.050 --> 49:28.218
Peter's a great guy.

49:29.844 --> 49:31.554
What's his deal, anyway?

49:31.596 --> 49:32.847
[chuckles]

49:32.889 --> 49:34.557
He's single,
if that's what you're asking.

49:34.599 --> 49:37.060
Wow! That is not what I meant.

49:37.102 --> 49:38.144
[Earl laughs]

49:38.186 --> 49:40.313
I mean, why did
he leave the island,

49:40.355 --> 49:42.065
and come back so suddenly?

49:42.107 --> 49:43.525
No one knows, really.

49:43.566 --> 49:45.568
I like to think
because he missed us,

49:45.610 --> 49:47.320
but you'll have to ask him.

49:48.446 --> 49:50.323
Switching gears.

49:50.365 --> 49:51.866
What about you and Ruth?

49:52.701 --> 49:53.910
What about us?

49:53.952 --> 49:55.578
We've been friends
for decades.

49:55.620 --> 49:57.247
Oh, right, okay.

49:57.288 --> 50:00.750
Plus, her Marty just passed
a couple years ago.

50:00.792 --> 50:02.127
It wouldn't feel right.

50:03.294 --> 50:05.088
Time is precious, Earl.

50:05.130 --> 50:06.965
Don't waste it.

50:07.007 --> 50:09.384
I hope you're taking
your own advice there, Missy.

50:09.426 --> 50:10.593
Oh!

50:10.635 --> 50:12.429
Ooh, nice work, you two!

50:12.470 --> 50:13.847
Some folks
are coming to my place

50:13.888 --> 50:15.765
for some hot cider
and cocoa.

50:15.807 --> 50:16.975
Why don't you come and join us,
and warm up?

50:17.017 --> 50:18.143
I'm in!

50:22.272 --> 50:25.275
So, care to take a walk
and admire our handiwork?

50:25.316 --> 50:27.318
I would love to.

50:35.702 --> 50:37.871
This is so magical,
it's like a dream.

50:37.912 --> 50:42.083
Right? This island never fails
to deliver on Christmas.

50:42.125 --> 50:45.920
I can't believe
you ever wanted to leave.

50:45.962 --> 50:47.589
Yeah. Well, my dad and I had

50:47.630 --> 50:50.050
a fairly complicated
relationship.

50:50.091 --> 50:52.510
My mother died
when I was really little,

50:52.552 --> 50:57.223
and I don't think he ever really
knew how to be a single dad.

50:57.265 --> 51:01.061
He just had a really hard time
with expressing emotion.

51:01.102 --> 51:03.897
He was very reserved.

51:05.065 --> 51:07.901
You know, that sounds familiar.

51:09.194 --> 51:11.112
[chuckles]

51:11.154 --> 51:13.573
Look, I'm trying to do better.

51:13.615 --> 51:16.284
My last girlfriend
actually told me

51:16.326 --> 51:19.120
that I was "terrible"
at expressing love.

51:19.162 --> 51:20.538
Hmm.

51:20.580 --> 51:25.168
But if she had a stoic
Swedish fisherman as a father,

51:25.210 --> 51:28.254
I think she'd understand that
it didn't come natural to me.

51:28.296 --> 51:30.840
Yeah, I get it.

51:30.882 --> 51:32.133
Telling someone you love them

51:32.175 --> 51:35.303
is the scariest thing
in the world.

51:35.345 --> 51:38.223
It's like giving somebody
all of your armor,

51:38.264 --> 51:42.227
so that you're just giving them
the power to hurt you.

51:42.268 --> 51:45.689
Why did you
and your ex split?

51:47.148 --> 51:48.983
[sighs heavily]
Um...

51:49.025 --> 51:51.194
well, Jason thinks

51:51.236 --> 51:53.738
that it's because
I worked too much,

51:53.780 --> 51:55.281
but the truth is,

51:55.323 --> 51:57.534
Max left us for a woman
that he met at the gym,

51:57.575 --> 52:00.787
and the reason that he couldn't
take Jason to Whistler

52:00.829 --> 52:03.623
is because she's...
three months pregnant.

52:04.749 --> 52:05.959
You're kidding?

52:06.001 --> 52:08.086
Max wasn't ready to tell him,
so...

52:08.128 --> 52:10.839
I told Jason
that she had the flu.

52:10.880 --> 52:12.590
I'm just so worried about
how he's gonna react

52:12.632 --> 52:14.175
when he finds out.

52:14.217 --> 52:16.219
He was devastated
when Max moved out,

52:16.261 --> 52:19.764
and now he's starting
a whole new family.

52:19.806 --> 52:21.016
I'm sorry.

52:21.057 --> 52:22.726
That's a lot to deal with.

52:22.767 --> 52:25.103
It must make dating hard.

52:25.145 --> 52:28.773
I actually haven't
dated at all yet.

52:28.815 --> 52:31.943
I'm terrified,
to be honest with you.

52:31.985 --> 52:33.820
You shouldn't be.

52:33.862 --> 52:36.114
You're smart,
you're beautiful,

52:36.156 --> 52:37.323
and you're a great mom.

52:37.365 --> 52:39.659
Anyone would be lucky
to have you.

52:42.954 --> 52:44.456
Um...

52:44.497 --> 52:46.958
listen, I have
something kinda cool

52:47.000 --> 52:48.752
I wanna show you and Jason
tomorrow morning.

52:48.793 --> 52:49.961
Can I stop by sometime?

52:50.003 --> 52:52.339
We'd love to have you.

52:53.173 --> 52:55.258
Well, it's a date.

52:55.300 --> 52:56.343
[chuckles]

53:01.973 --> 53:03.558
That's where it's coming from.

53:03.600 --> 53:04.684
Nice touch.

53:04.726 --> 53:05.727
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

53:05.769 --> 53:07.103
Yeah.

53:12.525 --> 53:13.818
Are you okay?

53:13.860 --> 53:15.820
You've been staring
at yourself forever.

53:15.862 --> 53:17.405
What? Yes! No.

53:17.447 --> 53:19.449
Fine. I'm just making sure
I look presentable.

53:19.491 --> 53:21.034
Why?

53:21.868 --> 53:24.496
Why... not?

53:24.537 --> 53:25.789
[knocking at door]

53:25.830 --> 53:27.624
Come in. It's open!

53:29.000 --> 53:30.502
Morning.

53:30.543 --> 53:34.714
I come bearing coffee
for the big kids and...

53:34.756 --> 53:36.716
a Christmas donut
for the man.

53:36.758 --> 53:37.717
Thanks, Peter.

53:37.759 --> 53:39.302
No problem.

53:40.804 --> 53:43.682
So, how goes the paper?

53:43.723 --> 53:45.058
Yeah, pretty good,
I think.

53:45.100 --> 53:46.017
It's crazy how long
this lighthouse

53:46.059 --> 53:47.185
has been in your family.

53:47.227 --> 53:49.688
Your great-great-grandpa
used to live here.

53:49.729 --> 53:51.523
That's so awesome.

53:51.564 --> 53:53.566
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

53:53.608 --> 53:56.277
Do you think we could come back
for March break?

53:56.319 --> 54:00.281
Maybe?
Yeah, if it's not booked up.

54:00.323 --> 54:02.367
You wanted
to show us something?

54:02.409 --> 54:03.576
Yeah.

54:03.618 --> 54:05.328
Well, Jason, you wanna
know what it's like

54:05.370 --> 54:07.080
growing up here, right?

54:07.122 --> 54:08.915
I'm gonna show you
one of my favorite things.

54:08.957 --> 54:10.208
Okay.

54:10.250 --> 54:11.459
If you put on a jacket,
you can come, too.

54:11.501 --> 54:13.378
[laughing]

54:13.420 --> 54:14.754
Usually,
guest lighthouse keepers

54:14.796 --> 54:17.924
don't get to see this, but...

54:17.966 --> 54:19.926
since you're both V.I.P.,

54:19.968 --> 54:22.345
I'll make an exception.

54:23.596 --> 54:25.348
[gasping]

54:25.390 --> 54:26.808
Ever since
I was a little kid,

54:26.850 --> 54:30.311
I'd come up here on the day
of the Christmas Festival.

54:30.353 --> 54:32.272
Boats from all around would come
and watch the lighthouse

54:32.313 --> 54:33.398
turn on its Christmas lights.

54:33.440 --> 54:34.566
So, they'll all
be here tomorrow

54:34.607 --> 54:35.442
when we light it up?

54:35.483 --> 54:36.901
Yup.

54:36.943 --> 54:38.737
This is so cool, right, Mom?

54:38.778 --> 54:41.406
Yes, it really is.

54:41.448 --> 54:43.825
[Katie]
Welcome to St. Nicholas Island!

54:43.867 --> 54:45.744
Merry Christmas!
Happy holidays!

54:45.785 --> 54:47.579
Hi! I'm Mayor Katie Cameron.

54:47.620 --> 54:50.123
If I can do anything at all,
please let me know!

54:50.165 --> 54:51.416
Well, look at that.

54:51.458 --> 54:54.753
There are so many people.
This is amazing.

54:54.794 --> 54:57.255
[***]

55:01.801 --> 55:04.304
[***]

55:07.974 --> 55:10.477
[***]

55:11.811 --> 55:14.272
[laughter]

55:18.026 --> 55:19.402
I don't know.

55:19.444 --> 55:21.988
Numbers always
just came really easy to me.

55:22.030 --> 55:23.907
I love strategizing
and planning,

55:23.948 --> 55:27.494
so, yeah, my brain's just
perfectly suited for my job,

55:27.535 --> 55:29.913
and I just did
what I loved.

55:29.954 --> 55:32.123
That's amazing.

55:32.165 --> 55:33.500
You should be
so proud of yourself.

55:33.541 --> 55:34.292
Thanks.

55:34.334 --> 55:36.252
[Sara] Okay, come on.

55:36.294 --> 55:37.295
-[Jason] Yes!
-[Sara] Yes!

55:37.337 --> 55:39.047
Oh, hey. Check it out.
Two o'clock.

55:39.089 --> 55:41.091
Oh.

55:41.132 --> 55:43.802
[***]

55:43.843 --> 55:45.512
Hey, what's wrong?

55:47.097 --> 55:50.183
I'm just realizing lately

55:50.225 --> 55:53.144
that life is moving
really fast these days.

55:53.186 --> 55:55.230
He's gonna be off to college
in no time.

55:55.271 --> 55:56.690
It's terrifying.

55:56.731 --> 55:58.149
Mm.

55:58.191 --> 56:01.528
Well, time is very precious,
that's for sure.

56:02.946 --> 56:04.280
You just have to make the most

56:04.322 --> 56:05.490
out of the time
you have together...

56:05.532 --> 56:07.325
now.

56:07.367 --> 56:09.869
He thinks
that he's such a grown-up,

56:09.911 --> 56:12.163
but he's really
still such a kid.

56:12.205 --> 56:13.331
[chuckling]

56:13.373 --> 56:16.001
He has these struggles
with abandonment,

56:16.042 --> 56:17.752
mostly because of his dad.

56:17.794 --> 56:19.796
I just want him to be okay.

56:19.838 --> 56:21.297
Well, hey, he will be.

56:21.339 --> 56:23.341
He's got you,

56:23.383 --> 56:25.844
and you're there for him,

56:25.885 --> 56:27.595
and that is all
that matters.

56:29.139 --> 56:31.599
You know, I loved my dad,

56:31.641 --> 56:35.020
but, like I told you,
he just checked out.

56:35.061 --> 56:36.229
You're not like that.

56:36.271 --> 56:37.981
You're here.

56:38.023 --> 56:40.608
You feel a lot of guilt
about your dad, don't you?

56:40.650 --> 56:41.985
Yeah.

56:43.111 --> 56:44.362
Seven years ago,

56:44.404 --> 56:46.781
I was on my way back
to the Christmas Festival

56:46.823 --> 56:50.869
to surprise him
and make things right,

56:50.910 --> 56:52.787
when I found out he died.

56:52.829 --> 56:55.582
Every time I look up
at that lighthouse,

56:55.623 --> 56:59.085
I just feel so much guilt and--
and heartbreak.

56:59.127 --> 57:01.880
He sacrificed so much for me
and I just...

57:01.921 --> 57:03.131
left him.

57:03.173 --> 57:05.091
He knows you loved him,

57:05.133 --> 57:07.761
and he would be so happy

57:07.802 --> 57:09.888
to see that you're continuing
to make sure

57:09.929 --> 57:12.515
that Christmas Star
shines bright year after year.

57:12.557 --> 57:14.476
You're keeping
his legacy alive,

57:14.517 --> 57:16.436
and I know
I never met him,

57:16.478 --> 57:18.396
but he would be
so proud of you.

57:18.438 --> 57:20.315
You're an amazing person.

57:21.691 --> 57:25.612
Melanie, I-I need
to tell you something.

57:26.446 --> 57:27.864
[Ruth] Hey! Peter!

57:29.074 --> 57:30.116
We're going dancin'.

57:30.158 --> 57:31.576
Um...

57:31.618 --> 57:33.953
maybe next time,
but-but thanks.

57:33.995 --> 57:35.872
Not this year. Mm-mm.

57:37.082 --> 57:38.708
This year, we're going.

57:38.750 --> 57:40.043
We're-- We are? Oh!

57:44.381 --> 57:47.092
[festive music plays]

57:47.133 --> 57:49.511
[***]

57:52.263 --> 57:53.640
Okay. We're doing this?

57:53.682 --> 57:55.475
Oh, yeah!
We're doing this. It's on.

57:55.517 --> 57:56.976
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

57:57.018 --> 57:59.979
You're never gonna be able
to unsee this, you realize that?

58:00.021 --> 58:00.980
Well, I hope not.

58:01.022 --> 58:04.109
Okay. Uh...

58:04.150 --> 58:07.320
[***]

58:07.362 --> 58:10.156
[laughing] Oh!

[laughs]

58:15.203 --> 58:17.163
[***]

58:17.205 --> 58:19.624
Just go with it.

58:19.666 --> 58:21.334
It's always the quiet ones.

58:21.376 --> 58:22.919
Yes.

58:22.961 --> 58:24.796
[song ends]

58:24.838 --> 58:26.965
[laughing]

58:27.007 --> 58:27.966
I warned you.

58:28.008 --> 58:29.217
Wow!

58:29.259 --> 58:32.387
* I wanna hear
the music play *

58:32.429 --> 58:35.807
* I wanna dance
and laugh and sway *

58:35.849 --> 58:37.058
* I wanna a happy... *

58:37.100 --> 58:41.104
Will you ever be able
to see me the same?

58:41.146 --> 58:43.481
I don't think so, but...

58:43.523 --> 58:46.234
[laughs]
...I have to say I'm impressed.

58:46.276 --> 58:47.944
I didn't think
you had it in you.

58:47.986 --> 58:48.945
[mocks hurt] Oh.

58:48.987 --> 58:50.363
[Mel laughs]

58:50.405 --> 58:51.781
Can I just say

58:51.823 --> 58:53.408
I'm really, really happy
you're here?

58:53.450 --> 58:55.243
I haven't enjoyed holidays
this much

58:55.285 --> 58:57.954
in many years.

58:57.996 --> 58:59.706
It's been magical.

58:59.748 --> 59:01.499
You have made this

59:01.541 --> 59:03.835
one of the best Christmases
I have ever had.

59:05.253 --> 59:06.212
Right back at you.

59:08.548 --> 59:10.050
[***]

59:10.091 --> 59:13.720
* ...Is it Christmas *

59:13.762 --> 59:21.394
* Calling out to me? *

59:21.436 --> 59:24.105

59:24.147 --> 59:26.566

with you tonight... *

59:26.608 --> 59:27.901
[Peter chuckling]

59:27.942 --> 59:29.944
But seriously,
that was, like, really fun, hmm?

59:29.986 --> 59:30.987
It was.

59:31.029 --> 59:32.072
Yeah.

59:32.113 --> 59:33.740
Um, hey...

59:33.782 --> 59:36.826
would you want to come
to dinner tomorrow night

59:36.868 --> 59:38.370
before the big
lighting ceremony?

59:39.454 --> 59:40.663
Definitely.

59:40.705 --> 59:42.791
Invitation accepted.

59:42.832 --> 59:44.501
Okay.

59:44.542 --> 59:45.752
[chuckling]

59:45.794 --> 59:47.170
Because, at some point,

59:47.212 --> 59:48.880
we're gonna have to discuss
those dance moves.

59:48.922 --> 59:50.674
I mean, they're jaw-dropping.

59:50.715 --> 59:51.925
-Mm-hmm.
-Breath-taking!

59:51.966 --> 59:52.926
Yeah.

59:52.967 --> 59:55.553
No one can really explain those.

59:55.595 --> 59:57.097
Not-- Not even me.

59:57.138 --> 59:58.765
-No?
-No.

01:00:07.107 --> 01:00:07.941
Good night.

01:00:07.982 --> 01:00:09.234
[chuckles]

01:00:09.275 --> 01:00:10.402
Yeah.

Good night.

01:00:36.177 --> 01:00:37.012
[dazed] Good night.

01:00:38.763 --> 01:00:41.558
* ...I sing a song
that feel like home *

[inhales deeply]

01:00:52.444 --> 01:00:54.195
Oh. Hey!

01:00:54.237 --> 01:00:56.156
Good night tonight?

01:00:56.197 --> 01:00:57.949
Yeah.

01:00:58.950 --> 01:01:00.326
You okay?

01:01:01.494 --> 01:01:03.329
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:01:03.371 --> 01:01:05.165
You sure?

01:01:05.206 --> 01:01:07.709
Yeah.

01:01:08.585 --> 01:01:10.211
Okay, well...

01:01:10.253 --> 01:01:11.254
I'm gonna go to bed.

01:01:11.296 --> 01:01:12.422
We have a big day tomorrow,

01:01:12.464 --> 01:01:13.631
getting ready
for the lighting festival.

01:01:13.673 --> 01:01:16.301
Okay.

01:01:18.303 --> 01:01:19.888
Good night.
I love you.

01:01:19.929 --> 01:01:21.222
You too.

01:01:21.264 --> 01:01:23.224

[thump]

01:01:31.566 --> 01:01:33.401
Wait! You two kissed?

01:01:33.443 --> 01:01:35.820
Shh! This phone is really loud.

01:01:35.862 --> 01:01:36.696
I don't want Jason to hear.

01:01:36.738 --> 01:01:37.822
<i>Slow down!</i>

01:01:37.864 --> 01:01:39.157
You haven't kissed anyone
since Max.

01:01:39.199 --> 01:01:40.367
This is big.

01:01:40.408 --> 01:01:41.326
[whimpers] I know.

01:01:41.368 --> 01:01:42.702
He's just so charming...

01:01:42.744 --> 01:01:43.828
and handsome,

01:01:43.870 --> 01:01:45.747
and he's really good to Jason.

01:01:45.789 --> 01:01:47.540
<i>I guess I just got</i>
<i>caught up in the moment.</i>

01:01:47.582 --> 01:01:49.167
Well, I think this is great!

01:01:49.209 --> 01:01:50.877
It's about time
you started dating.

01:01:50.919 --> 01:01:53.505
Whoa! We are not dating.

01:01:53.546 --> 01:01:55.590
I am i-in Seattle,

01:01:55.632 --> 01:01:56.883
and I don't even know

01:01:56.925 --> 01:02:00.011
if Jason is ready
for a new man in his life.

01:02:00.053 --> 01:02:01.471
Don't push something good away

01:02:01.513 --> 01:02:03.473
just because it's safer
to keep things the way they are.

01:02:03.515 --> 01:02:05.392
<i>I know you have a hard time</i>
<i>trusting people--</i>

01:02:05.433 --> 01:02:06.559
especially men--

01:02:06.601 --> 01:02:07.977
but you deserve
to find love.

01:02:08.019 --> 01:02:09.729
This is not about
what I deserve!

01:02:09.771 --> 01:02:11.064
This is about what's right
for Jason,

01:02:11.106 --> 01:02:12.273
and right now,
I'm just happy

01:02:12.315 --> 01:02:13.483
that the kid hasn't
rolled his eyes at me

01:02:13.525 --> 01:02:14.484
in the last three days.

01:02:14.526 --> 01:02:15.902
Don't make excuses, Mel.

01:02:15.944 --> 01:02:17.445
You know the best thing
for any kid to see

01:02:17.487 --> 01:02:18.697
is their parent happy.

01:02:18.738 --> 01:02:20.031
Stop being so wise.

01:02:20.073 --> 01:02:21.741
It's getting really annoying.

01:02:21.783 --> 01:02:23.243
Well, call me tomorrow
with updates, okay?

01:02:23.284 --> 01:02:24.744
I'm so excited for you!

01:02:24.786 --> 01:02:26.287
Enjoy getting your smooch on.

01:02:26.329 --> 01:02:27.247
You're insane.

01:02:27.288 --> 01:02:28.081
You love it.

01:02:28.123 --> 01:02:29.499
I do.

01:02:29.541 --> 01:02:31.334
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

01:02:31.376 --> 01:02:32.711
[hangs receiver up]

01:02:32.752 --> 01:02:34.504
Hey! How'd you sleep?

01:02:34.546 --> 01:02:35.505
Okay.

01:02:36.965 --> 01:02:39.801
Are you ready for tonight?

01:02:41.845 --> 01:02:44.472
Sure. I mean, it's just
plugging in a few lights.

01:02:44.514 --> 01:02:47.434
Oh, well, everyone here
is pretty excited about it.

01:02:47.475 --> 01:02:48.768
I guess so.

01:02:48.810 --> 01:02:50.228
[deep breath]

01:02:50.270 --> 01:02:53.106
So, I invited Peter
to dinner tonight.

01:02:53.148 --> 01:02:54.566
Is that okay?

01:02:54.607 --> 01:02:56.651
Whatever.

01:02:56.693 --> 01:02:58.403
What do you mean, "Whatever"?

01:02:58.445 --> 01:03:00.113
I thought you liked him.

01:03:00.155 --> 01:03:01.281
I do.

01:03:01.322 --> 01:03:03.116
[sighs]

01:03:03.158 --> 01:03:04.868
It's just...

01:03:04.909 --> 01:03:06.077
have you talked to Dad at all?

01:03:07.162 --> 01:03:08.329
No.

01:03:08.371 --> 01:03:10.498
M-My service has been
really out of whack,

01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:12.709
and I haven't even turned on
my phone these last three days.

01:03:12.751 --> 01:03:14.127
Why?

01:03:14.169 --> 01:03:16.963
I just haven't talked to him
in a while, and...

01:03:17.005 --> 01:03:19.007
sometimes, I feel like
he forgets about me.

01:03:19.049 --> 01:03:20.800
Hey...

01:03:20.842 --> 01:03:23.303
buddy, no,
that is not true.

01:03:23.345 --> 01:03:26.806
Look, him and Laura
are just busy

01:03:26.848 --> 01:03:29.434
and they're getting ready
for the new--

01:03:30.518 --> 01:03:32.354
The new what?

01:03:33.646 --> 01:03:35.482
Car. They're...

01:03:35.523 --> 01:03:36.733
getting a new car.

01:03:36.775 --> 01:03:38.526
Oh, okay.

01:03:38.568 --> 01:03:40.695
But, if you want, we can
call him later tonight, okay?

01:03:40.737 --> 01:03:42.113
Okay.

01:03:43.531 --> 01:03:44.908
Hey. Jase.

01:03:44.949 --> 01:03:46.117
Look at me.

01:03:47.869 --> 01:03:49.996
You know,
no matter what,

01:03:50.038 --> 01:03:52.499
nobody will ever replace you,
right?

01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:55.585
You will always be your dad
and I's special guy--

01:03:55.627 --> 01:03:56.920
and I'm just
putting it out there,

01:03:56.961 --> 01:03:59.506
but if you wanted to invite Sara
to dinner tonight,

01:03:59.547 --> 01:04:01.174
I'd be happy to have her.

01:04:01.216 --> 01:04:02.801
So...
let me get this straight.

01:04:02.842 --> 01:04:04.094
You're planning on cooking?

01:04:04.135 --> 01:04:06.262
Hey!

01:04:06.304 --> 01:04:07.389
Yes!

01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:09.349
I found this cookbook
in the cupboard

01:04:09.391 --> 01:04:11.017
and I thought that it'd be
fun to make something

01:04:11.059 --> 01:04:13.019
with a little
lighthouse history.

01:04:14.896 --> 01:04:16.690
Okay, I'll ask her...

01:04:16.731 --> 01:04:18.191
but, if I were you,

01:04:18.233 --> 01:04:19.651
I'd have Ruth's
fish and chips ordered

01:04:19.693 --> 01:04:20.527
as a back-up plan.

01:04:20.568 --> 01:04:21.861
Wow!

01:04:21.903 --> 01:04:23.613
Ye of little faith!

01:04:23.655 --> 01:04:24.698
It's going to be amazing.

01:04:24.739 --> 01:04:25.824
If you say so.

01:04:25.865 --> 01:04:27.450
You'll see!

01:04:27.492 --> 01:04:28.868
[inhales tensely]

01:04:28.910 --> 01:04:31.663
It might not be amazing.

01:04:31.705 --> 01:04:35.291
Mm-hmm.
No, I understand, but, look.

01:04:35.333 --> 01:04:37.711
I don't think I'm ready
to do it just yet.

01:04:37.752 --> 01:04:39.504
I-I know we agreed, but...

01:04:39.546 --> 01:04:41.131
Look.

01:04:41.172 --> 01:04:42.424
It's part of my family legacy.

01:04:42.465 --> 01:04:43.967
Can't we just take a beat?

01:04:44.009 --> 01:04:45.593
You know, get him to back off
for a few days?

01:04:47.012 --> 01:04:49.305
He's coming here tonight
for a final inspection?

01:04:49.347 --> 01:04:50.473
[knocking on door]

01:04:50.515 --> 01:04:52.142
Um, look, I gotta go.

01:04:52.183 --> 01:04:54.602
Okay. Yeah.
I'll call you later, thanks.

01:04:54.644 --> 01:04:56.521
Hey, Peter.

01:04:56.563 --> 01:04:57.814
Hey, Earl. What's up?

01:04:57.856 --> 01:04:59.649
Just stopped by
to see how you're doing.

01:04:59.691 --> 01:05:01.026
Earl, I, uh...

01:05:01.067 --> 01:05:02.777
[chuckles awkwardly]

01:05:02.819 --> 01:05:04.195
I think
I made a big mistake.

01:05:05.030 --> 01:05:06.197
About what?

01:05:07.574 --> 01:05:09.159
I have to sell the lighthouse.

01:05:10.243 --> 01:05:11.369
What?

01:05:11.411 --> 01:05:14.080
Look, Dad left
all these unpaid bills--

01:05:14.122 --> 01:05:16.374
loans, and tax notices,

01:05:16.416 --> 01:05:18.251
and-and it's up to me
to pay them now.

01:05:18.293 --> 01:05:19.210
It's a mess,

01:05:19.252 --> 01:05:20.545
and I don't know
what else to do.

01:05:20.587 --> 01:05:23.089
Hey, I--
I'm sorry, Peter.

01:05:23.131 --> 01:05:25.091
I wish
you had told me sooner.

01:05:25.133 --> 01:05:27.052
Yeah, I just wanted
to get it done,

01:05:27.093 --> 01:05:28.136
and forget about it,

01:05:28.178 --> 01:05:29.596
but now that I'm here,

01:05:29.637 --> 01:05:30.764
I realize how much

01:05:30.805 --> 01:05:32.390
this lighthouse
means to everyone.

01:05:32.432 --> 01:05:33.850
I don't think
I can go through with it.

01:05:33.892 --> 01:05:34.768
What can we do?

01:05:34.809 --> 01:05:37.479
I don't know.

01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:38.938
This guy--

01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:41.191
Ray,
he's a real-estate developer--

01:05:41.232 --> 01:05:44.152
he wants to turn
this property into condos,

01:05:44.194 --> 01:05:46.196
or maybe a vacation home,
or something.

01:05:46.237 --> 01:05:47.822
Wait-- you mean
tear down the lighthouse?

01:05:47.864 --> 01:05:50.241
Maybe. He hasn't decided yet.

01:05:50.283 --> 01:05:51.409
Oh, Peter!

01:05:51.451 --> 01:05:53.078
Earl, I'm so sorry.

01:05:53.119 --> 01:05:54.245
I don't know
what I was thinking.

01:05:54.287 --> 01:05:55.288
It's okay.

01:05:55.330 --> 01:05:57.165
We will figure something out.

01:05:57.207 --> 01:06:00.001
I'm just so confused
right now.

01:06:00.043 --> 01:06:01.294
About everything.

01:06:01.336 --> 01:06:03.171
Including Melanie,
you mean?

01:06:03.213 --> 01:06:05.048
Earl, she's gonna
leave with Jason

01:06:05.090 --> 01:06:06.716
after Christmas.

01:06:06.758 --> 01:06:09.928
There's no-- there's no point
to get feelings involved.

01:06:09.969 --> 01:06:13.264
You can't run away every time
things get complicated, Peter.

01:06:13.306 --> 01:06:15.058
Yeah, well, I guess
you're right about that.

01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:16.643
Do you like her?

01:06:16.685 --> 01:06:19.187
[sighs]

01:06:19.229 --> 01:06:20.563
Yeah.

01:06:20.605 --> 01:06:21.648
Well, then tell her!

01:06:28.238 --> 01:06:30.115
[overlapping chatter
and laughter]

01:06:30.156 --> 01:06:31.741
Now there's expectations.

01:06:31.783 --> 01:06:32.867
[laughing]

01:06:32.909 --> 01:06:34.786
Guys, this was so good.

01:06:34.828 --> 01:06:36.913
I can't believe you found
that old recipe

01:06:36.955 --> 01:06:40.083
and made my great-grandma's
famous holiday <i>Julebolle.</i>

01:06:40.125 --> 01:06:41.334
[laughter]

01:06:41.376 --> 01:06:42.419
Well, I'm just glad
I didn't butcher it.

01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:44.462
-Mm-mm!
-I have a new kitchen,

01:06:44.504 --> 01:06:45.922
so this is kind of
my return to cooking.

01:06:45.964 --> 01:06:47.382
-Mm.
-[scoffs] Yeah, right!

01:06:47.424 --> 01:06:49.259
She's never gonna cook.

01:06:49.300 --> 01:06:50.427
She just likes the way
her new kitchen looks.

01:06:50.468 --> 01:06:52.429
Hey, you never know!

01:06:52.470 --> 01:06:53.763
Come on.

01:06:53.805 --> 01:06:55.598
I thought it was delicious.
Thank you, Melanie.

01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:56.558
You're welcome.

01:06:56.599 --> 01:06:59.227
I may not be a chef, but...

01:06:59.269 --> 01:07:01.229
they say
that the best part of a meal

01:07:01.271 --> 01:07:02.897
is who you share it with,

01:07:02.939 --> 01:07:04.899
and I couldn't be happier than
to share it with all of you.

01:07:04.941 --> 01:07:06.443
Okay, Mom.

01:07:06.484 --> 01:07:08.069
-That was really cringey.
-Really?

01:07:08.111 --> 01:07:09.029
I kinda liked that.

01:07:09.070 --> 01:07:10.613
-Me too.
-Yeah.

01:07:10.655 --> 01:07:12.073
Well, you guys,
it's almost time.

01:07:12.115 --> 01:07:13.408
Should we get outside?

01:07:13.450 --> 01:07:15.201
Yeah, the carolers
should be here any minute.

01:07:15.243 --> 01:07:15.952
-Okay.
-Oh, and Jason?

01:07:17.287 --> 01:07:18.496
Do you want to help me
turn on the lights?

01:07:18.538 --> 01:07:19.664
Really?

01:07:19.706 --> 01:07:20.749
Yeah.

01:07:20.790 --> 01:07:21.916
Yeah, I'd love to!

01:07:21.958 --> 01:07:23.084
That's like a big deal!

01:07:23.126 --> 01:07:24.044
[Peter] Let's get to it.

01:07:24.085 --> 01:07:26.087
[Mel] Aw.

01:07:26.129 --> 01:07:30.342
* Fa-la-la-la-la
La-la, la, la *

01:07:32.093 --> 01:07:33.386
Come one, come all,

01:07:33.428 --> 01:07:35.889
to the great
St. Nicholas Island

01:07:35.930 --> 01:07:37.891
Christmas Lighting
Festival!

01:07:37.932 --> 01:07:41.770
This ceremony is very important
to so many of us.

01:07:41.811 --> 01:07:43.730
It's not just a symbol
of Christmas cheer,

01:07:43.772 --> 01:07:44.814
but of hope--

01:07:44.856 --> 01:07:47.400
a reminder that,
through the darkness,

01:07:47.442 --> 01:07:49.110
there is always light
to be found,

01:07:49.152 --> 01:07:50.487
to guide us.

01:07:50.528 --> 01:07:52.155
That's why
Sir St. Nicholas

01:07:52.197 --> 01:07:53.615
called it
his "Christmas Star".

01:07:53.656 --> 01:07:57.285
I also must make
a few honorable mentions.

01:07:57.327 --> 01:07:59.621
This year,
our cherished lighthouse

01:07:59.662 --> 01:08:01.456
was spiffied up
and beautified

01:08:01.498 --> 01:08:05.210
with the help of Melanie Dalton,
Jason Dalton,

01:08:05.251 --> 01:08:07.712
and our very own
Peter Sanderson!

01:08:07.754 --> 01:08:09.005
[all applauding]

01:08:10.423 --> 01:08:12.592
Now, join me
as we count down--

01:08:12.634 --> 01:08:13.635
from five,

01:08:13.677 --> 01:08:14.719
four,

01:08:14.761 --> 01:08:15.762
three,

01:08:15.804 --> 01:08:16.846
two,

01:08:16.888 --> 01:08:17.889
one!

01:08:17.931 --> 01:08:19.474
[power clunks]

01:08:19.516 --> 01:08:22.268
[cheering and applauding]

01:08:22.310 --> 01:08:23.937
[cheering]

01:08:23.978 --> 01:08:25.313
Attaboy!

01:08:25.355 --> 01:08:26.564
Really good.

01:08:26.606 --> 01:08:28.316
I'm very, very, very proud
of you, buddy.

01:08:28.358 --> 01:08:29.442
[Jason] Yeah?

01:08:31.027 --> 01:08:32.821
Great job, you two.

01:08:32.862 --> 01:08:34.030
It was awesome.

01:08:34.072 --> 01:08:35.031
We should come back
every year.

01:08:36.491 --> 01:08:39.411
Well, we'll see
if Peter lets us.

01:08:42.247 --> 01:08:43.498
Can I get you two
some hot chocolate?

01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:44.833
-Yes, please.
-Yeah, you in?

01:08:44.874 --> 01:08:47.043
-I'd love some.
-Okay, be right back.

01:08:48.962 --> 01:08:50.505
Thanks, Mom,

01:08:50.547 --> 01:08:51.548
for making this happen.

01:08:53.925 --> 01:08:55.385
Oh!

01:08:57.721 --> 01:08:59.889
I got a gift for Sara.
I'm gonna go grab it.

01:08:59.931 --> 01:09:01.641
[contented sigh]

01:09:01.683 --> 01:09:03.560
Excuse me.

01:09:03.601 --> 01:09:05.061
Are--

01:09:05.103 --> 01:09:06.187
Are you
Peter Sanderson's wife?

01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:08.064
Peter's wife?

01:09:08.106 --> 01:09:10.025
No, I'm, um...
I'm just a friend.

01:09:10.066 --> 01:09:11.526
Maybe a little more than
a friend.

01:09:11.568 --> 01:09:13.820
It's really kind of
undecided yet.

01:09:13.862 --> 01:09:15.113
Sorry, who are you?

01:09:15.155 --> 01:09:16.364
I'm Ray Schultz.

01:09:16.406 --> 01:09:17.490
I'm here
for the final inspection

01:09:17.532 --> 01:09:19.200
and walk-through
of the lighthouse.

01:09:19.242 --> 01:09:20.368
Will Peter be back soon?

01:09:20.410 --> 01:09:21.703
"Final inspection"?

01:09:21.745 --> 01:09:23.163
Sorry, I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:09:23.204 --> 01:09:24.998
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.

01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:27.042
I just assumed everyone knew.

01:09:27.083 --> 01:09:29.002
I-I'm buying the lighthouse.

01:09:29.044 --> 01:09:32.213
I-I'd like to get the deal done
before Christmas Day.

01:09:32.255 --> 01:09:33.840
Buying the lighthouse?

01:09:33.882 --> 01:09:35.800
You don't, um...

01:09:35.842 --> 01:09:39.095
really seem like
the lighthouse-keeper type.

01:09:39.137 --> 01:09:40.722
Oh, no, gosh. Never.

01:09:40.764 --> 01:09:43.641
I'm thinking about turning it
into a rental property,

01:09:43.683 --> 01:09:46.561
or I might just demolish it
and build a house, you know?

01:09:46.603 --> 01:09:48.688
Like, a-a summer vacation home.

01:09:48.730 --> 01:09:50.982
I mean,
these views are incredible.

01:09:51.024 --> 01:09:52.400
Tearing it down?

01:09:52.442 --> 01:09:54.486
Does Peter know that
you're planning on doing this?

01:09:54.527 --> 01:09:56.071
[Peter] Ray?

01:09:56.112 --> 01:09:58.281
You're here.

01:09:58.323 --> 01:10:00.241
I am.

01:10:00.283 --> 01:10:01.701
How could you do this?

01:10:01.743 --> 01:10:03.244
You're letting him
tear down the lighthouse?

01:10:03.286 --> 01:10:04.996
-Melanie--
-You lied to us.

01:10:05.038 --> 01:10:07.916
You used us to fix it up
so that you could just sell it!

01:10:07.957 --> 01:10:09.084
No, that is not true.

01:10:09.125 --> 01:10:10.710
Okay? I was trying

01:10:10.752 --> 01:10:12.962
to do one last
Christmas Festival,

01:10:13.004 --> 01:10:14.089
for everyone.

01:10:14.130 --> 01:10:15.632
Jason is gonna be
heartbroken.

01:10:15.674 --> 01:10:18.051
This whole town
is gonna be heartbroken.

01:10:18.093 --> 01:10:19.511
I honestly can't believe you.

01:10:19.552 --> 01:10:21.346
Mel-- Melanie!

01:10:21.388 --> 01:10:22.889
Oh, sorry.
Can you hold this, please?

01:10:22.931 --> 01:10:24.474
Mel!

01:10:25.934 --> 01:10:27.185
Melanie, wait.

01:10:27.227 --> 01:10:28.520
Melanie!

01:10:28.561 --> 01:10:29.688
Wait, just let me explain, okay?

01:10:29.729 --> 01:10:31.147
There's nothing to explain!

01:10:31.189 --> 01:10:33.483
You know how hard it is
for me to trust people,

01:10:33.525 --> 01:10:34.901
and you spent the last week
lying to me

01:10:34.943 --> 01:10:36.277
so you could make
a few extra dollars.

01:10:36.319 --> 01:10:37.445
I tried to tell you
the other night,

01:10:37.487 --> 01:10:38.988
but then you...

01:10:39.030 --> 01:10:40.448
you leaned in and...

01:10:40.490 --> 01:10:41.616
I got distracted.

01:10:41.658 --> 01:10:43.034
Oh, so it's my fault?

01:10:43.076 --> 01:10:44.619
That's not what I'm saying.

01:10:44.661 --> 01:10:47.789
Listen, this lighthouse
is barely functional as it is.

01:10:47.831 --> 01:10:49.374
It hasn't been used
to bring people to safety

01:10:49.416 --> 01:10:50.458
in over 20 years.

01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:51.793
It's a relic,

01:10:51.835 --> 01:10:53.378
and I can't afford to keep it!

01:10:53.420 --> 01:10:55.547
Your father would be
so disappointed in you.

01:10:56.506 --> 01:10:58.049
You know nothing
about my father.

01:10:58.091 --> 01:10:59.467
I know enough.

01:10:59.509 --> 01:11:00.885
[exhales] Okay.

01:11:00.927 --> 01:11:03.471
You're the last person
to lecture me about honesty

01:11:03.513 --> 01:11:05.056
when you can't even
be honest with your own son.

01:11:05.098 --> 01:11:06.683
What are you talking about?

01:11:06.725 --> 01:11:07.809
You--

01:11:07.851 --> 01:11:08.852
You haven't even told Jason

01:11:08.893 --> 01:11:10.979
that his father
is having a baby.

01:11:11.021 --> 01:11:12.981
That is a completely
different situation!

01:11:13.023 --> 01:11:15.150
-Oh, hardly.
-It's up to him to tell him!

01:11:15.191 --> 01:11:17.027
[huffs]

01:11:18.278 --> 01:11:19.446
You know what?

01:11:19.487 --> 01:11:20.613
I'm not doing this.

01:11:20.655 --> 01:11:22.365
Tomorrow morning,

01:11:22.407 --> 01:11:23.867
Jason and I are leaving.

01:11:25.076 --> 01:11:26.661
Mel--

01:11:26.703 --> 01:11:28.204
Merry Christmas, Peter.

01:11:30.749 --> 01:11:32.542
Fine.

01:11:33.418 --> 01:11:34.794
Yeah.

01:11:38.548 --> 01:11:39.799
[door closes]

01:11:43.511 --> 01:11:45.930

01:11:50.435 --> 01:11:52.645
[***]

01:11:59.486 --> 01:12:02.280
[foghorn bellows]

01:12:10.705 --> 01:12:12.749
[calls out] Jase?

01:12:14.542 --> 01:12:16.586
[***]

01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:22.550
Merry Christmas Eve, buddy.

01:12:22.592 --> 01:12:25.553
So, I was thinking...

01:12:25.595 --> 01:12:27.847
why don't we spend Christmas
at home?

01:12:27.889 --> 01:12:30.308
Jason?

01:12:30.350 --> 01:12:32.310
Jason? Where are you?

01:12:37.232 --> 01:12:38.566
Jason?

01:12:38.608 --> 01:12:39.943
[bells jingle]

01:12:39.984 --> 01:12:41.111
Hey, you.

01:12:41.152 --> 01:12:42.404
Something wrong?

01:12:42.445 --> 01:12:43.446
Have you seen Jason?

01:12:43.488 --> 01:12:45.281
I've been looking everywhere
for him,

01:12:45.323 --> 01:12:46.324
and I can't find him anywhere.

01:12:46.366 --> 01:12:47.200
Maybe he's with Sara
and her friends?

01:12:47.242 --> 01:12:48.993
Maybe.

01:12:49.035 --> 01:12:51.079
It's just he normally
leaves a note

01:12:51.121 --> 01:12:52.163
if he's going anywhere.

01:12:52.205 --> 01:12:54.541
Let me call Sara.

01:12:54.582 --> 01:12:57.002
I'm sure he's okay.

01:12:57.043 --> 01:12:59.754
[***]

01:13:17.313 --> 01:13:19.149
[outboard chugging]

01:13:20.316 --> 01:13:22.694
[***]

01:13:28.575 --> 01:13:30.577
[phone ringing]

01:13:36.791 --> 01:13:39.210
Oh.

01:13:39.252 --> 01:13:41.004
Hey, Ruth.

01:13:42.172 --> 01:13:43.506
What?

01:13:43.548 --> 01:13:46.634
[footsteps]

01:13:46.676 --> 01:13:47.844
Anything?

01:13:47.886 --> 01:13:49.721
We've looked everywhere.

01:13:49.763 --> 01:13:51.014
But Sara has rounded up
some of the kids

01:13:51.056 --> 01:13:52.223
to help look for him.

01:13:52.265 --> 01:13:54.351
It's been hours.
Where could he be?

01:13:54.392 --> 01:13:57.020
He's never even gone anywhere
without leaving a note.

01:13:57.062 --> 01:13:58.021
Look, I checked
with the water taxi.

01:13:58.063 --> 01:13:59.481
They haven't seen him yet,
but--

01:13:59.522 --> 01:14:00.857
Melanie?

01:14:00.899 --> 01:14:02.192
Our boat is missing.

01:14:02.233 --> 01:14:03.693
Sara showed Jason the boat
the other day,

01:14:03.735 --> 01:14:04.652
and we think
he might have taken it.

01:14:04.694 --> 01:14:06.488
What? No!

01:14:06.529 --> 01:14:08.573
He's never even driven
a boat in his life!

01:14:08.615 --> 01:14:09.616
Hey, it's okay.

01:14:09.657 --> 01:14:11.284
We're gonna find him.

01:14:11.326 --> 01:14:13.411
I promise.

01:14:15.997 --> 01:14:17.207
You two, stay here.

01:14:17.248 --> 01:14:19.209
We need eyes at the lighthouse!

01:14:19.250 --> 01:14:20.835
Contact me
if you see or hear anything.

01:14:20.877 --> 01:14:21.711
Are you sure
you don't need me to come?

01:14:21.753 --> 01:14:23.922
-Positive.
-No, I'm coming.

01:14:23.963 --> 01:14:25.131
All right, you go,

01:14:25.173 --> 01:14:26.925
and I'll be at the lighthouse,
all right?

01:14:28.385 --> 01:14:29.719
Don't worry.

01:14:29.761 --> 01:14:31.554
Christmas miracles are what
this island's all about.

01:14:32.764 --> 01:14:33.723
All right, we're good.

01:14:33.765 --> 01:14:36.267
[***]

01:14:48.446 --> 01:14:51.199

01:14:52.617 --> 01:14:53.993

01:15:07.340 --> 01:15:09.676
"The gift
of divine direction..."

01:15:24.482 --> 01:15:25.442
Oh!

01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:27.986
Okay.

01:15:28.987 --> 01:15:31.114
[outboard sputtering]

01:15:31.156 --> 01:15:33.450
[starter fails to catch]

01:15:36.828 --> 01:15:38.038

[***]

01:15:47.255 --> 01:15:49.257
[Mel]
I can't take this anymore.

01:15:49.299 --> 01:15:52.427
[tearfully] He's all alone.
He must be so scared!

01:15:52.469 --> 01:15:53.386
We'll find him.

01:15:53.428 --> 01:15:54.220
He's smart.

01:15:54.262 --> 01:15:55.930
He'll know what to do.

01:15:55.972 --> 01:15:58.516
[sighs]
Where are you, Jason?

01:16:04.105 --> 01:16:06.358
[***]

01:16:16.534 --> 01:16:17.535
[flashlight clicks]

01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:24.876
Come on, buddy.

01:16:24.918 --> 01:16:27.170
[***]

01:16:30.548 --> 01:16:31.549
That's him.

01:16:31.591 --> 01:16:33.718
[***]

01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:34.844
I found him!

01:16:34.886 --> 01:16:36.304
<i>Jason's off Benson Point!</i>

01:16:36.346 --> 01:16:37.222
Copy that!

01:16:37.263 --> 01:16:38.932
[laughs]
He's using Morse code!

01:16:38.973 --> 01:16:40.809
What's he saying?
Is he okay?

01:16:42.185 --> 01:16:44.604
He's spelling out
"Happy Holidays!"

01:16:44.646 --> 01:16:46.564
Let's go get him.

01:16:46.606 --> 01:16:48.525
[***]

01:16:48.566 --> 01:16:50.902
Thattaboy!

01:16:50.944 --> 01:16:52.070
[Jason, wrought]
<i>I'm so sorry, Mom.</i>

01:16:52.112 --> 01:16:53.863
I really am.

01:16:53.905 --> 01:16:55.448
It's okay.
You're-- You're safe.

01:16:55.490 --> 01:16:56.658
What happened?

01:16:56.700 --> 01:16:58.201
Why did you go out alone?

01:16:58.243 --> 01:17:01.204
I heard you and Peter talking
about Dad having a new baby,

01:17:01.246 --> 01:17:03.498
and I realized
we'll never be a family again.

01:17:03.540 --> 01:17:05.750
Jase, I am so sorry.

01:17:05.792 --> 01:17:07.877
I wanted to tell you, I did.

01:17:07.919 --> 01:17:10.880
Your dad wanted
to tell you in person.

01:17:10.922 --> 01:17:12.048
He might be
starting a new family,

01:17:12.090 --> 01:17:13.258
but that does not mean

01:17:13.299 --> 01:17:14.634
that you do not
mean the world to him.

01:17:14.676 --> 01:17:16.344
When the new baby comes,

01:17:16.386 --> 01:17:17.512
he's gonna spend
less and less time with me.

01:17:17.554 --> 01:17:20.223
I know that this
is a lot to take in...

01:17:20.265 --> 01:17:22.559
but your dad loves you,

01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:23.893
and he's always gonna
make time for you.

01:17:23.935 --> 01:17:25.520
We both love you,

01:17:25.562 --> 01:17:27.188
and nothing's ever
gonna change that.

01:17:27.230 --> 01:17:29.149
Do you promise?

01:17:29.983 --> 01:17:32.193
I promise.

01:17:32.235 --> 01:17:34.571
And next time
that you're feeling scared

01:17:34.612 --> 01:17:35.572
or uncertain,

01:17:35.613 --> 01:17:36.906
find me.

01:17:36.948 --> 01:17:38.241
Talk to me.

01:17:38.283 --> 01:17:41.036
I'm your lighthouse.

01:17:41.077 --> 01:17:44.122
And if you're lost
and you can't find your way,

01:17:44.164 --> 01:17:46.541
I'm always gonna
be here to guide you.

01:17:46.583 --> 01:17:47.959
You got that?

01:17:48.001 --> 01:17:49.044
I love you, Mom.

01:17:49.085 --> 01:17:50.879
Ohh.

01:17:53.256 --> 01:17:55.759
[sniffles]
I love you, too.

01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:58.887
[***]

01:18:00.805 --> 01:18:03.224
[footsteps]

01:18:05.352 --> 01:18:08.355
Here, honey...
drink this.

01:18:08.396 --> 01:18:09.522
Thanks.

01:18:10.648 --> 01:18:11.649
I love you so much,

01:18:11.691 --> 01:18:12.817
and I can't wait

01:18:12.859 --> 01:18:14.277
to open presents with you
tomorrow morning.

01:18:17.030 --> 01:18:18.615
Mom...

01:18:19.657 --> 01:18:21.034
Yeah?

01:18:21.076 --> 01:18:22.619
It's still early.

01:18:22.660 --> 01:18:23.912
Go talk to him.

01:18:23.953 --> 01:18:25.872
Who?

01:18:25.914 --> 01:18:27.791
Peter.

01:18:27.832 --> 01:18:29.334
You like him,
don't you?

01:18:29.376 --> 01:18:31.211
Jason.

01:18:31.252 --> 01:18:33.380
The only thing
I'm thinking about right now

01:18:33.421 --> 01:18:34.297
is you.

01:18:34.339 --> 01:18:35.674
You deserve to have

01:18:35.715 --> 01:18:37.300
someone in your life
that makes you happy.

01:18:37.342 --> 01:18:39.219
You make me happy.

01:18:39.260 --> 01:18:41.554
Mom, you know what I mean.

01:18:41.596 --> 01:18:43.264
He's a good guy!

01:18:43.306 --> 01:18:44.724
Go make things right
before I steal another boat

01:18:44.766 --> 01:18:46.393
and never come back.

01:18:46.434 --> 01:18:47.227
Too soon?

01:18:47.268 --> 01:18:48.687
Way too soon!

01:18:48.728 --> 01:18:50.188
[laughing]

01:18:55.777 --> 01:18:57.654
Peter, where have you been?

01:18:57.696 --> 01:18:59.739
Ray, sorry, long story.

01:18:59.781 --> 01:19:02.659
We were supposed to sign
these documents hours ago.

01:19:02.701 --> 01:19:04.744
I-I wasn't planning
on staying overnight.

01:19:04.786 --> 01:19:06.996
Ray, I'm sorry...

01:19:07.038 --> 01:19:08.540
but the deal's off.

01:19:09.916 --> 01:19:12.210
What are you talking about?

01:19:12.252 --> 01:19:15.088
I just can't sell it
and let it get torn down,

01:19:15.130 --> 01:19:17.590
or be turned into
some vacation home.

01:19:17.632 --> 01:19:19.884
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Peter, we had a deal.

01:19:19.926 --> 01:19:21.261
I know, Ray,

01:19:21.302 --> 01:19:22.846
but this lighthouse means more
to this island,

01:19:22.887 --> 01:19:24.014
and to me,

01:19:24.055 --> 01:19:25.849
than you'll ever understand.

01:19:25.890 --> 01:19:27.934
I loved my dad,

01:19:27.976 --> 01:19:29.853
but he was
a stubborn, stubborn man,

01:19:29.894 --> 01:19:32.856
and he should've told me
about the debts he had,

01:19:32.897 --> 01:19:35.817
the loans he couldn't pay
and the taxes overdue,

01:19:35.859 --> 01:19:37.152
but he didn't,

01:19:37.193 --> 01:19:38.820
and I can't do anything
about that right now,

01:19:38.862 --> 01:19:42.532
but what I can do
is not sell the lighthouse...

01:19:42.574 --> 01:19:45.118
because if I do... [sighs]
...I'd never forgive myself.

01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:48.079
Peter, I know
this isn't an easy situation,

01:19:48.121 --> 01:19:49.581
and I-I feel for you.

01:19:49.622 --> 01:19:51.124
Okay? But you said it
yourself--

01:19:51.166 --> 01:19:53.710
you cannot afford
to keep this place,

01:19:53.752 --> 01:19:57.339
so either I buy it from you
and you walk away debt-free,

01:19:57.380 --> 01:19:58.798
or the government takes it.

01:19:58.840 --> 01:20:00.216
Which do you prefer?

01:20:00.258 --> 01:20:02.218
I need more time, Ray.

01:20:02.260 --> 01:20:03.803
I-I still think
I can figure this out.

01:20:03.845 --> 01:20:05.221
How?

01:20:05.263 --> 01:20:07.557
[Mel]
I'll partner with him.

01:20:07.599 --> 01:20:09.017
[Peter] Melanie?

01:20:10.977 --> 01:20:12.062
Investing is what I do--

01:20:12.103 --> 01:20:13.355
and that lighthouse

01:20:13.396 --> 01:20:15.523
is the best investment
I could ever make.

01:20:15.565 --> 01:20:17.025
Okay, wait a minute,
what-what's happening?

01:20:17.067 --> 01:20:18.234
Who are you, again?

01:20:18.276 --> 01:20:19.861
Oh, Melanie Dalton.

01:20:19.903 --> 01:20:21.654
Peter's new business partner.

01:20:23.281 --> 01:20:25.825
Bus-Business?
Peter?

01:20:25.867 --> 01:20:27.035
I--

01:20:27.077 --> 01:20:28.244
Well...

01:20:28.286 --> 01:20:30.914
you heard
my new business partner.

01:20:30.955 --> 01:20:32.290
She's made her decision.

01:20:33.750 --> 01:20:37.128
Well, it looks like
another Christmas miracle

01:20:37.170 --> 01:20:39.214
has come
to St. Nicholas Island.

01:20:39.255 --> 01:20:40.340
[chuckles]

01:20:40.382 --> 01:20:41.758
[Peter] I think so.

01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:43.259
Ray, I'm sorry.

01:20:43.301 --> 01:20:44.761
Thank you
for understanding.

01:20:44.803 --> 01:20:45.762
[brushing it off] Ah!

01:20:45.804 --> 01:20:47.931
I wish you both
the best of luck.

01:20:49.557 --> 01:20:52.102
Merry Christmas, Ray.

01:20:52.143 --> 01:20:53.645
Merry Christmas.

01:21:02.946 --> 01:21:04.280
[laughs]

01:21:04.322 --> 01:21:06.282
Are you sure about this?

01:21:06.324 --> 01:21:07.826
I mean,
it's not gonna be easy.

01:21:07.867 --> 01:21:10.078
Of course,
it's not going to be easy!

01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:12.372
Anything worth doing
never is,

01:21:12.414 --> 01:21:14.082
and Earl can manage the property

01:21:14.124 --> 01:21:15.625
-when we're not here.
-"We"?

01:21:15.667 --> 01:21:17.419
We can register it
as a historic landmark,

01:21:17.460 --> 01:21:19.462
and even apply
for non-profit status

01:21:19.504 --> 01:21:21.798
so that we're exempt
from any future taxes.

01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:24.801
You've really thought
this through, haven't you?

01:21:24.843 --> 01:21:26.720
It's what I do.

01:21:26.761 --> 01:21:29.139
Well... should we go
take a look at your--

01:21:29.180 --> 01:21:32.017
our... new investment?

01:21:33.184 --> 01:21:35.061
Definitely.

01:21:36.312 --> 01:21:39.357
[***]

01:21:44.446 --> 01:21:48.324
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
the whole story this week.

01:21:48.366 --> 01:21:50.326
I just care about
you and Jase so much,

01:21:50.368 --> 01:21:52.662
I didn't want
to jeopardize that...

01:21:52.704 --> 01:21:53.955
and honestly,

01:21:53.997 --> 01:21:56.207
what scared me the most...

01:21:56.249 --> 01:21:58.501
was how much
I was falling for you.

01:21:59.878 --> 01:22:01.838
Falling for me?

01:22:03.340 --> 01:22:05.342
Yeah.

01:22:05.383 --> 01:22:07.677
Well, good...

01:22:07.719 --> 01:22:11.473
because I am absolutely
falling for you, too.

01:22:13.475 --> 01:22:15.852
[***]

01:22:28.239 --> 01:22:30.408
[***]

01:22:40.877 --> 01:22:43.004
That one looks like
the lighthouse.

01:22:43.046 --> 01:22:45.423
It does, and I think--
I think we saw this earlier,

01:22:45.465 --> 01:22:47.175
and that's what
it looks like on the inside.

01:22:47.217 --> 01:22:49.177
Yeah. Oh!

01:22:51.179 --> 01:22:52.555
Hello.

01:22:52.597 --> 01:22:54.099
Thanks again
for getting him that book.

01:22:54.140 --> 01:22:56.559
He hasn't even looked at
the, uh, video game I got him.

01:22:56.601 --> 01:22:57.727
Well, that's a good sign.

01:22:57.769 --> 01:22:58.603
[chuckles]

01:22:58.645 --> 01:23:00.689
And this is for you.

01:23:00.730 --> 01:23:02.023
Oh!

01:23:06.277 --> 01:23:07.904
The lighthouse.

01:23:07.946 --> 01:23:09.155
Our lighthouse.

01:23:09.197 --> 01:23:10.448
I love it.

01:23:10.490 --> 01:23:11.574
* Whoa, ho, ho *

01:23:11.616 --> 01:23:12.951
* Like the snow *

01:23:12.992 --> 01:23:14.994
* It falls... *

01:23:15.036 --> 01:23:16.287
Merry Christmas!

01:23:16.329 --> 01:23:18.790
-Hey!
-Oh, come in!

01:23:18.832 --> 01:23:20.959
-Merry Christmas!
-Merry Christmas.

01:23:21.001 --> 01:23:21.835
Oh, Merry Christmas!

01:23:21.876 --> 01:23:25.255
[***]

01:23:25.296 --> 01:23:26.965
Bring it in, buddy.

01:23:27.007 --> 01:23:31.052
[***]

01:23:36.349 --> 01:23:40.979
[***]
