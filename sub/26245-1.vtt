Raymond. Sup?

00:48.749 --> 00:51.166
Where's, uh, where's Freddy?

00:51.268 --> 00:53.936
How come you didn't put
the bet on?

00:54.038 --> 00:56.772
I did.
I told ya.

00:56.874 --> 00:59.041
You talked to Mick?

00:59.143 --> 01:00.275
Yeah.

01:00.444 --> 01:03.312
And he said you didn't put
the fucking bet on.

01:03.414 --> 01:05.547
No, he's a fucking liar.

01:05.649 --> 01:07.966
Careful, mate.

01:08.069 --> 01:10.702
What?

01:10.805 --> 01:11.670
I've known Mick for 20 years.

01:13.040 --> 01:14.973
Ray.

01:15.076 --> 01:18.477
I swear to God
I put the bet on.

01:18.579 --> 01:19.978
I don't know what Mick's
talking about.

01:39.683 --> 01:41.500
I got Matty.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.802
<i>What's he saying?</i>

01:43.904 --> 01:46.205
He reckons Mick's
full of shit.

01:46.307 --> 01:47.906
<i>What do you think?</i>

01:48.008 --> 01:49.908
I think somebody's
full of shit.

01:51.645 --> 01:53.645
<i>Put him on.</i>

01:53.747 --> 01:54.780
Freddy wants a word with you.

01:54.882 --> 01:55.914
Yeah.

01:58.836 --> 01:59.668
- Freddy.
- <i>Mate?</i>

01:59.770 --> 02:01.737
Yup.

02:01.839 --> 02:04.006
<i>Look, mate, I like you,
but...</i>

02:04.108 --> 02:07.309
<i>that I can't trust, okay?</i>

02:07.411 --> 02:08.310
What are you talking about?

02:08.412 --> 02:10.846
<i>You didn't put the bet on.</i>

02:10.948 --> 02:12.381
<i>I mean, cost me 30 grand.</i>

02:12.483 --> 02:15.167
<i>All right?</i>

02:15.269 --> 02:18.570
Uh, I put the bet on, I...

02:18.672 --> 02:22.007
<i>But lying?</i>

02:22.109 --> 02:23.408
<i>If you got something to say,
let's have a talk.</i>

02:26.247 --> 02:28.881
Yeah, I fucked up.
I'm sorry, mate.

02:28.983 --> 02:30.666
<i>Why didn't you put
the bet on?</i>

02:30.768 --> 02:33.569
I was gonna put the bet on,
but I just...

02:33.671 --> 02:36.805
I ran into a mate and he
had some gear and...

02:36.907 --> 02:40.375
Yeah, I just fucked up, man.

02:40.477 --> 02:41.810
<i>Hey, we all fuck up.</i>

02:41.912 --> 02:42.711
<i>The important thing is that
you...</i>

02:42.813 --> 02:45.480
Fuck, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, mate.

02:45.583 --> 02:47.633
<i>Forget it!
Yeah, put Ray back on.</i>

02:47.735 --> 02:49.334
Okay, thanks, Freddy.

02:56.010 --> 02:56.909
Yeah, man.

02:57.011 --> 02:57.976
<i>Fuck him up a bit.</i>

02:58.078 --> 02:59.478
<i>Not to kill him, but...</i>

02:59.580 --> 03:02.047
Okay. Hold on.

03:10.474 --> 03:12.541
Next time Freddy tells you
to do something, mate,

03:12.643 --> 03:14.276
just fucking do it.
Yeah?

03:14.378 --> 03:15.677
I know. I know.
Sorry, mate.

03:15.779 --> 03:16.812
I just...

03:19.450 --> 03:20.265
Putting it in.

03:23.103 --> 03:24.403
Oh, shit!

03:24.505 --> 03:25.737
Ugh!

04:47.638 --> 04:48.770
What's the news, my friend?

04:48.872 --> 04:51.673
No news.

04:51.775 --> 04:53.208
- No news?
- No.

04:53.310 --> 04:54.409
What's news with you?

04:56.180 --> 04:57.746
I got some bad news.

04:57.848 --> 04:58.947
Yeah?

04:59.049 --> 05:01.333
I had a bad week this week.

05:01.435 --> 05:03.135
You have a bad week
every week.

05:04.305 --> 05:05.470
What?

05:09.476 --> 05:11.376
How long we been doing
business?

05:11.478 --> 05:13.912
I'm a little early, Ray,
to be honest.

05:14.014 --> 05:15.047
Don't turn this around on me,
shithead.

05:15.149 --> 05:16.081
You should have the money.

05:18.335 --> 05:19.368
Okay, okay, okay.

05:22.973 --> 05:25.807
I got a guy who owes me ten.
All right?

05:25.909 --> 05:27.075
Over in Ashfield.

05:27.177 --> 05:29.444
You want to go get that?

05:29.546 --> 05:30.879
You can keep it.

05:32.583 --> 05:34.866
Okay.
So, ten.

05:34.968 --> 05:36.368
Plus a G on top.

05:37.771 --> 05:38.937
For what?

05:39.039 --> 05:41.039
For collecting on the debt.

05:42.743 --> 05:43.709
Collecting on the...

05:43.811 --> 05:46.078
You're keeping the money.

05:46.180 --> 05:47.846
I know, but I shouldn't have
to go and get the money

05:47.948 --> 05:50.565
from somebody else, should I?

05:50.667 --> 05:51.566
Hey, hey, you met Micky?

05:51.668 --> 05:54.403
Micky!
This is Ray.

05:54.505 --> 05:56.304
This the guy I was telling you
about.

05:56.407 --> 05:57.539
Hey, man.

05:57.641 --> 05:59.241
- Hey, you all right?
- Yeah, good. Yourself?

05:59.343 --> 06:02.044
- Hey, good.
- Hey.

06:02.146 --> 06:03.745
Go take him to see
that guy in Ashfield.

06:03.847 --> 06:05.647
Yeah, sure.

06:29.223 --> 06:30.338
So how long you been working
for Freddy?

06:39.083 --> 06:39.781
So you want to have a go at
this guy

06:39.883 --> 06:43.001
at Ashfield then, or...

06:43.103 --> 06:45.103
Fuck yeah.

06:57.901 --> 06:58.733
All yours.

07:01.071 --> 07:02.771
- Hey Terry.
- Who the fuck are you?

07:02.873 --> 07:04.439
Fuckin' wise
motherfucker.

07:04.541 --> 07:05.707
Give me the fuckin' money!

07:05.809 --> 07:06.875
Where is it?

07:06.977 --> 07:09.711
Fuckin' Freddy's money!
Where is it?

07:09.813 --> 07:11.213
- Hold on!
- Don't tell me to hold on,

07:11.315 --> 07:12.047
you fucking cocksucker.

07:12.149 --> 07:14.399
I'll get it!

07:14.501 --> 07:15.333
Okay, I'll give the money,
okay?

07:19.740 --> 07:21.239
Well, hurry up.

07:21.341 --> 07:23.141
Look, I haven't got it now.

07:23.243 --> 07:25.944
But I can get it later.

07:26.046 --> 07:26.978
I'll get it at the end
of the week.

07:27.080 --> 07:27.979
No. Now.

07:28.081 --> 07:30.081
I don't have it.

07:30.184 --> 07:31.066
Come on, mate.

07:31.168 --> 07:31.933
I'm not your mate, dickhead.

07:34.037 --> 07:36.338
I'm gonna count to three.

07:36.440 --> 07:38.340
- I don't have it.
- One.

07:38.442 --> 07:40.242
Look, I'll get it

07:40.344 --> 07:41.243
end of this week.

07:41.345 --> 07:42.511
- I swear.
- Two.

07:42.613 --> 07:45.213
Um, please, sorry.
Mate, don't.

07:45.315 --> 07:47.899
How long you married, Terry?

07:48.001 --> 07:50.035
Uh...
12 years.

07:51.171 --> 07:53.939
Got your wallet?

07:58.879 --> 08:00.078
There's a couple hundred
in here.

08:00.247 --> 08:00.712
I can go to the ATM
and get some.

08:02.683 --> 08:05.000
No, don't worry about it,
mate.

08:05.102 --> 08:09.037
Hold on.
Nice looking family.

08:09.139 --> 08:12.040
- Thanks.
- Very nice.

08:12.142 --> 08:14.142
You live in Kirribilli?

08:14.244 --> 08:16.011
- Yeah.
- Huh?

08:17.381 --> 08:19.181
Hartley Crescent.

08:19.283 --> 08:20.866
I love Kirribilli.

08:20.968 --> 08:22.300
It's a very, very nice place.

08:22.402 --> 08:24.769
You stay here with him, mate,
all right?

08:24.872 --> 08:26.505
Where you going?

08:26.607 --> 08:27.939
I'm going to Kirribilli.

08:28.041 --> 08:30.442
No, uh, look, um...

08:30.544 --> 08:31.643
I'll get you
your money, okay?

08:31.745 --> 08:34.212
- Um...
- I don't want any money.

08:34.313 --> 08:35.847
What do you mean?

08:35.948 --> 08:37.465
Well, it's not my job to
collect money.

08:37.568 --> 08:37.631
It's his job.

08:40.703 --> 08:41.403
What's your job?

08:41.505 --> 08:43.138
My job's to make you sorry

08:43.240 --> 08:45.106
you didn't pay
when you had the chance.

08:45.209 --> 08:47.209
Look, I want to do
the right thing.

08:47.311 --> 08:48.944
Ah.

08:49.046 --> 08:50.612
- I've got the money.
- Yeah?

08:50.714 --> 08:52.581
I just have to go and get it,
okay?

08:52.649 --> 08:53.999
Oh, okay.
Right.

08:54.101 --> 08:56.868
Well, you get it now.
Okay?

08:56.970 --> 08:57.903
You go with him.

08:58.005 --> 08:59.538
If he gives he any trouble,

08:59.640 --> 09:01.573
you give me a call, all right?
Okay?

09:01.675 --> 09:02.707
Yep.

09:04.912 --> 09:07.012
You don't mind if I keep
this, do you?

09:07.114 --> 09:08.146
No?

09:14.438 --> 09:14.603
Let's go.

09:30.437 --> 09:31.937
Come here, come here.

09:32.039 --> 09:34.639
Ooh.

09:34.741 --> 09:37.175
Oy! Eddie!

09:37.277 --> 09:39.511
- Oh.
- Eddie, wait.

09:39.613 --> 09:40.979
- Sorry.
- No, you're all right.

09:41.081 --> 09:43.048
- He's a bit of a maniac.
- He is.

09:43.150 --> 09:45.066
No, don't worry about it.
He's fine.

09:45.168 --> 09:46.901
- Eddie. Sorry.
- No, you're all right.

09:47.004 --> 09:47.936
Your dog's not going to eat
my dog, is he?

09:48.038 --> 09:49.271
No, I just fed him, so...

09:49.373 --> 09:50.839
Right. Okay.

09:50.941 --> 09:52.641
Pretty safe for the next half
hour anyway.

09:52.743 --> 09:54.342
Good, good.

09:54.444 --> 09:56.645
What's his name?

09:56.747 --> 09:57.879
- Boof.
- Boof?

09:57.981 --> 09:59.114
G'day, Boof.

09:59.216 --> 10:00.148
Yeah.
Is that a Frenchie?

10:00.250 --> 10:01.733
Yeah, yeah. Eddie.

10:01.835 --> 10:03.301
- Eddie the Frenchie.
- Yeah.

10:07.808 --> 10:09.407
I'm Ally, by the way.

10:09.509 --> 10:10.575

- Ray.

10:10.677 --> 10:13.244

- Nice to meet you too.

10:13.347 --> 10:15.447
So you come here a bit,
do you?

10:15.549 --> 10:16.982
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

10:17.084 --> 10:18.333
It's nice.
I like being by the water.

10:18.435 --> 10:22.737
It kind of feels like you're...

10:22.839 --> 10:24.272
You know, not in the city,
even though you are.

10:24.374 --> 10:26.107
Yeah.
Definitely.

10:30.714 --> 10:31.780
Yeah.

10:36.803 --> 10:41.106
Well, I best
probably should, um,

10:41.208 --> 10:43.174
just let you get on with it,

10:43.276 --> 10:44.342
- get back to...
- Get on with it.

10:44.444 --> 10:47.679
- Get back to it.
- Yeah, it's important work.

10:47.781 --> 10:49.648
Yep.

10:49.750 --> 10:50.699
Yeah. All right,
well, nice to meet you.

10:50.801 --> 10:52.867
Yeah, you too.
Um, have a good one.

10:52.969 --> 10:53.868
- Yeah...
- Bye.

10:53.970 --> 10:56.071
You too. See you later.

10:56.173 --> 10:58.039
- Come on.
- Yeah, I'll catch you around.

10:58.141 --> 10:59.741
Come on!

10:59.843 --> 11:01.443

mate,

11:52.012 --> 11:53.111
and what do I do?

11:57.667 --> 11:58.867
Nothing.

12:37.340 --> 12:38.873
- Hi, Ray.
- Quintin.

12:42.279 --> 12:44.612
Here we go.
All right.

12:44.714 --> 12:46.181

- Bye.

12:46.283 --> 12:47.465
- How you doing, sweetheart?
- I'm good.

No.

13:35.248 --> 13:37.115
- What are they teaching you?
- Nothing.

13:39.069 --> 13:40.368
What about the boys?

13:40.470 --> 13:40.869
How the boys treating you?

remember who I got it for.

Your kind of film.

Yeah, it's up my alley.

14:07.147 --> 14:08.112
I mean, I haven't seen it

Yeah, it's about a squirrel.

14:10.083 --> 14:11.533

What's going on?

14:27.017 --> 14:28.466
Nothing.

14:30.570 --> 14:32.370
Anything happening at
the chick department?

14:32.472 --> 14:34.772
No. You?

14:34.875 --> 14:37.342
Oh, man.

14:37.444 --> 14:38.710
Since I got the motor neurone,

14:38.812 --> 14:41.012
I've been beating them off
with a stick.

14:41.781 --> 14:43.414
Ladies love it.

14:43.516 --> 14:46.134
Soon as I tell 'em
I've got MND,

14:46.236 --> 14:48.369
they're all over me like
a fly on shit.

14:48.471 --> 14:50.371

14:52.642 --> 14:53.608
You owe me a dollar.

14:57.781 --> 15:00.114
You swore.

The "S" word.

15:02.869 --> 15:05.436

15:15.615 --> 15:16.648
Nope.

Okay, but you owe me.

15:26.209 --> 15:28.509
Yeah, I'm good for it.

15:58.241 --> 16:01.109
Fuckin' hell, mate.

16:01.211 --> 16:03.711

16:09.069 --> 16:10.134
Hey, don't worry about it,
mate.

16:10.236 --> 16:11.469
Nobody expects you to get it

16:11.571 --> 16:12.470
Hey, what's happening?

16:12.572 --> 16:13.838

She's pissed as hell,

16:44.237 --> 16:46.838
and I've told her it was yours.

16:46.940 --> 16:48.439
Why would you tell her
it was mine?

16:48.541 --> 16:49.340
Because she was gonna fuckin'

16:52.045 --> 16:53.344
I need you to come back
and apologize to her.

16:53.446 --> 16:55.179
For what?

16:55.281 --> 16:56.848
For leaving the porno
at my joint.

16:56.950 --> 16:59.667
Why the fuck would I leave

16:59.769 --> 17:01.335
I don't know. You just did.

17:01.438 --> 17:03.504
I didn't know what else to say.

17:03.606 --> 17:06.473
I just need you to come back
and apologize to her.

17:06.576 --> 17:08.810
This is fuckin' big.

Well, that's not true.

23:08.638 --> 23:10.404
