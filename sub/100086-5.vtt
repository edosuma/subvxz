00:00.046 --> 00:02.914
<i>The '80s sparked some
of the most iconic couples ever!</i>

00:03.000 --> 00:04.734
<i>From Loni and Burt to Goldie and Kurt,</i>

00:04.797 --> 00:07.399
<i>if you acted together, you
usually ended up together.</i>

00:07.433 --> 00:09.668
<i>And since my ex, Dana,
had come back into my life,</i>

00:09.702 --> 00:12.937
<i>I secretly hoped the fall play
would rekindle our romance.</i>

00:12.972 --> 00:15.974
Ladies and lords,
hold on to your Tudor caps.

00:16.008 --> 00:17.842
Romeo and Juliet!

00:17.877 --> 00:19.477
Yes! It's <i>West Side Story</i>

00:19.512 --> 00:21.680
without the fun music or Latino gangs.

00:21.714 --> 00:23.515
I haven't read it yet,
but Carla's always saying

00:23.549 --> 00:25.717
how we're totally gonna end
up like Romeo and Juliet.

00:25.751 --> 00:26.846
Oh, boy.

00:26.871 --> 00:28.268
Well, I'm definitely
auditioning for Juliet.

00:28.293 --> 00:29.721
And good luck, everyone else,

00:29.755 --> 00:31.122
'cause you're a shoo-in, girlfriend.

00:31.157 --> 00:33.325
Friend that's a girl. Just girl.

00:33.359 --> 00:35.493
You know what you got.
Have a Romeo in mind?

00:35.528 --> 00:37.929
Who're we kidding?
Andrew Gallery crushed it as Romeo

00:37.978 --> 00:39.664
at that fancy arts camp last summer.

00:39.699 --> 00:41.900
Right. Gallery.

00:41.934 --> 00:44.102
<i>Yep, every drama class had one...</i>

00:44.136 --> 00:47.839
<i>Handsome, weirdly confident,
and totally unbearable.</i>

00:47.873 --> 00:49.848
I find if I only wash
my hair once a month,

00:49.879 --> 00:51.176
it gets a natural messiness

00:51.210 --> 00:53.113
that I can't acquire with
a traditional conditioner.

00:53.138 --> 00:54.679
You are so brave.

00:54.714 --> 00:56.314
- I want to play a marine one day.
- Oh.

00:56.349 --> 00:59.317
Apparently he told the Yale theater
program he'd "let them know."

00:59.352 --> 01:01.653
Someone should let him know
he's not all that.

01:01.687 --> 01:03.888
No way, bro. Gallery
checks all the boxes!

01:03.923 --> 01:05.022
Accept it.

01:05.057 --> 01:06.891
There's just way better
people in the world.

01:06.926 --> 01:08.059
I guess he's kinda cute.

01:08.094 --> 01:09.942
Anyway, I'm gonna go run lines.

01:09.973 --> 01:12.284
If Dana lands Juliet
opposite Andrew Gallery,

01:12.318 --> 01:14.119
it will for sure turn into a showmance.

01:14.153 --> 01:15.220
"Showmance"?

01:15.254 --> 01:16.621
Just because two beautiful teens

01:16.656 --> 01:18.857
spend hours together
rehearsing and kissing

01:18.891 --> 01:21.326
in the most romantic play
ever doesn't mean...

01:21.360 --> 01:22.861
- Oh, balls, balls!
- Yep.

01:22.895 --> 01:25.363
That drab auditorium might
as well be The Blue Lagoon,

01:25.398 --> 01:27.165
'cause young love is afoot.

01:27.199 --> 01:28.266
You're a foot.

01:28.301 --> 01:29.801
You know what?
Maybe I'll try out for Romeo.

01:29.835 --> 01:31.503
Then you better start
learning some Shakespeare.

01:31.537 --> 01:33.972
It's not exactly the
easy-breezy dialogue from <i>ALF.</i>

01:34.006 --> 01:36.141
I will get the part
and showmance with Dana

01:36.175 --> 01:37.876
and prove you and everyone else wrong.

01:37.910 --> 01:40.412
<i>But, unfortunately, that meant this.</i>

01:40.446 --> 01:42.180
"O Schmoopie-o, Schmoopie-o,

01:42.214 --> 01:44.416
"wherefore art thou, Schmoopie-o?"

01:44.450 --> 01:45.950
Mom! Enough with the Schmoopie-o's!

01:45.985 --> 01:48.075
Shakespeare would love the way I talk.

01:48.114 --> 01:49.948
You know who doesn't love the
way you guys are talking?

01:49.982 --> 01:51.483
- Vic and I.
- I don't mind, Mur.

01:51.517 --> 01:53.918
My daughter's auditioning for that play.

01:53.953 --> 01:55.387
Asha? She's like five years old.

01:55.421 --> 01:56.855
Oh, she was... 11 years ago.

01:56.889 --> 01:58.423
Well, tell Asha to break a leg.

01:58.457 --> 02:00.325
I most certainly will not.

02:00.359 --> 02:02.861
The last thing I want is my sweet angel

02:02.895 --> 02:05.029
in some teen raunchfest.

02:05.064 --> 02:06.131
Raunchfest?

02:06.165 --> 02:08.933
That Shakespeare was a grade-A horndog.

02:08.967 --> 02:12.504
There's no way I'm letting
some hormonal Romeo

02:12.538 --> 02:14.606
smooch up my little princess.

02:14.640 --> 02:17.142
Don't worry about this one
landing the role. No offense.

02:17.176 --> 02:19.444
Offense taken, taken hard!

02:19.478 --> 02:22.380
Watch me perform
Romeo's death by poison.

02:22.415 --> 02:24.416
Ohh!

02:24.450 --> 02:26.418
Thy drugs are quick.

02:26.452 --> 02:29.521
Oh, no! Thus with a kiss, I die!

02:29.555 --> 02:31.322
With Mama's kiss, you live!

02:31.357 --> 02:32.891
No!

02:32.925 --> 02:35.560
If thou goest, then I go, too.

02:35.594 --> 02:36.628
Oh, give me that vial.

02:36.662 --> 02:38.096
You two mind dying in the kitchen?

<i>and Erica was crushing
college academically.</i>

02:58.284 --> 03:00.552
Cheggit! I got another "A"
on my sociology midterm.

03:00.586 --> 03:01.920
Another perfect grade?

03:01.954 --> 03:03.922
Your GPA is gonna look
like Fonzie on a Friday...

03:03.956 --> 03:05.390
All "Aaays."

03:05.424 --> 03:07.325
Yeah, I don't have time to
acknowledge how lame that was.

03:07.359 --> 03:08.593
Come on, let's celebrate

03:08.627 --> 03:10.895
by going to one of the many
fun hangs on this corkboard.

03:10.930 --> 03:12.130
Oh, no! A lost dog?

03:12.164 --> 03:14.799
Snowball is fine, and so am I.
No parties.

03:14.834 --> 03:17.268
But all you do is go from
your dorm to the classroom

03:17.303 --> 03:18.470
and back to your dorm.

03:18.504 --> 03:20.405
I mean, get out there. Meet some people.

03:20.439 --> 03:21.906
And if you do, ask them if they've seen

03:21.941 --> 03:24.375
a bichon/pug mix who loves carrots.

03:24.410 --> 03:26.478
Whoa! Whoa! Can't stop! Can't stop!

03:26.512 --> 03:27.679
Can't stop!

03:27.713 --> 03:28.813
- Ugh!
- Ohh!

03:28.848 --> 03:31.382
Oh! I am so sorry.

03:31.417 --> 03:32.484
Are you okay?

03:32.518 --> 03:34.118
This is my first time
riding a skateboard.

03:34.153 --> 03:36.254
Yeah, well, a crowded,
public space full of strangers

03:36.288 --> 03:37.455
is a perfect place to start.

03:37.490 --> 03:39.057
Oh, here, take my sweater.
Your knee is bleeding.

03:39.091 --> 03:40.625
Wait. Is this cashmere?

03:40.659 --> 03:42.160
I don't want to ruin it
with my knee blood.

03:42.194 --> 03:43.261
It'll give it character.

03:43.295 --> 03:44.796
And then some cute guy
is gonna come up to me,

03:44.830 --> 03:46.598
and he'll be like, "Hey, you
got blood on your sweater,"

03:46.632 --> 03:47.866
and I'll be like, "You're stupid."

03:47.900 --> 03:49.501
And then he'll be my
boyfriend for a few weeks,

03:49.535 --> 03:50.602
and I will have you to thank.

03:50.636 --> 03:52.103
Wow. You're, like, a lot.

03:52.137 --> 03:54.472
Thanks! I'm Ren. It's short for Lauren.

03:54.507 --> 03:56.774
I'm Erica. Or Ca?

03:56.809 --> 03:58.009
Yeah, that doesn't work.

03:58.043 --> 03:59.844
Um, well, it was nice
to break your fall.

03:59.879 --> 04:01.246
Don't look, but there is
a guy over there

04:01.280 --> 04:03.615
who is majorly creeping on you.

04:03.649 --> 04:06.184
Oh, yeah. That creeper's my boyfriend.

04:06.218 --> 04:08.179
- He wants me to make a friend.
- Tell him you did.

04:08.249 --> 04:10.588
<i>And just like that,
over the next few days,</i>

04:10.623 --> 04:13.258
<i>my sister's first college
friendship was born.</i>

04:13.292 --> 04:15.326
<i>Erica and Ren checked out local music.</i>

04:15.361 --> 04:16.694
College bands suck.

04:16.728 --> 04:18.596
Oh, for sure.

04:18.630 --> 04:19.697
We're taking this.

04:19.732 --> 04:21.266
I'll bring it back
when you learn how to use it.

04:21.300 --> 04:22.500
Run!

04:24.537 --> 04:26.704
<i>And then they hit up
the campus art scenes.</i>

04:26.739 --> 04:28.540
This one is just squiggles.

04:28.574 --> 04:30.141
I posed nude for that.

04:30.175 --> 04:31.797
For real? Oh, damn!

04:31.822 --> 04:32.836
That's your butt!

04:32.883 --> 04:34.646
<i>Yep, Erica and Ren were inseparable.</i>

04:34.680 --> 04:36.681
<i>Nothing could derail their friendship.</i>

04:36.715 --> 04:37.949
<i>Well, almost nothing.</i>

04:37.983 --> 04:39.150
Oh, [bleep].

04:39.184 --> 04:41.352
Ooh, are we randomly cursing? Ass!

04:41.387 --> 04:43.688
- No. It's Parents Weekend.
- I know. I'm stoked.

04:43.722 --> 04:45.857
Gene and Rita are taking me
somewhere fancy to eat.

04:45.891 --> 04:47.892
Gene and Rita? That's so informal.

04:47.927 --> 04:49.727
It's like you consider them people.

04:49.762 --> 04:51.296
Yeah, my mom's
a kickass defense attorney.

04:51.330 --> 04:53.164
She puts bad people back on the street.

04:53.198 --> 04:55.066
And, uh, my dad owns a couple
restaurants in the city.

04:55.100 --> 04:56.534
Wow, we have so much in common.

04:56.569 --> 04:57.969
I mean, my mom could have been a lawyer,

04:58.003 --> 05:00.238
and my dad owns something
he calls restaurant pants.

05:00.272 --> 05:01.906
I'm just so glad that my mom and dad

05:01.941 --> 05:03.041
aren't like those psycho parents

05:03.075 --> 05:04.242
that are in your face all the time.

05:04.276 --> 05:05.677
- Totally.
- Holy crap.

05:05.711 --> 05:07.512
We should all grab brunch
together this weekend.

05:07.546 --> 05:08.913
That is... an idea.

05:08.948 --> 05:11.182
Here's the thing...
They can never meet you.

05:11.216 --> 05:12.250
What? Why not?

05:12.284 --> 05:14.886
'Cause they were, um...

05:14.920 --> 05:16.854
- Lost at sea.
- What?

05:16.889 --> 05:19.257
Yeah, that's a real thing that
I just told you from my mouth.

05:19.291 --> 05:21.326
Oh, my God. Were they, like,
on a cruise or something?

05:21.360 --> 05:23.061
Yes. That makes the most sense.

05:23.095 --> 05:25.763
Yeah, they... They were
cruising for a bruisin'...

05:25.798 --> 05:27.098
And they got one.

05:27.132 --> 05:28.900
That must be so hard
for you and your brother.

05:28.934 --> 05:31.069
Cheggit! Package from Mom.

05:31.103 --> 05:34.238
Homemade fudgy crunch bars!

05:34.273 --> 05:36.674
Whoo! So fudgy in my mouth!

05:36.709 --> 05:38.242
How does it go down?

05:38.277 --> 05:40.545
So sticky!

05:40.579 --> 05:43.448
Sweet, sad Barry.
He just hasn't accepted it.

05:43.482 --> 05:44.882
That is sad.

05:44.917 --> 05:46.517
<i>As Erica leaned into her lie,</i>

05:46.552 --> 05:49.187
<i>all I cared about was beating
out Andrew Gallery</i>

05:49.221 --> 05:50.655
<i>for the lead of</i> Romeo and Juliet.

05:51.290 --> 05:53.191
Dude, you're Romeo.

05:53.225 --> 05:54.425
I know, Dave Kim.

05:54.460 --> 05:55.994
Romeo kisses Juliet!

05:56.028 --> 05:57.428
I know, Dave Kim!

05:57.463 --> 05:59.197
And Dana is...

05:59.231 --> 06:00.632
Lady Montague?

06:00.666 --> 06:01.766
Oh, no, Dave Kim.

06:01.800 --> 06:03.101
That means she's playing my...

06:03.135 --> 06:04.149
Mom.

06:04.174 --> 06:05.770
- I mean, it could be worse.
- Could it?

06:05.804 --> 06:07.171
It's not like you're
playing my actual mom.

06:07.206 --> 06:09.440
Even if you were, I've heard
my dad say more than once

06:09.475 --> 06:10.808
that she's a handsome lady.

06:10.843 --> 06:12.377
And I'll shut up.

06:12.411 --> 06:14.545
But if you didn't get Juliet, who did?

06:14.580 --> 06:15.880
There's my Romeo.

06:15.914 --> 06:17.582
Asha? Congrats.

06:17.616 --> 06:19.684
Dana, you know Asha.
Asha, you know Dana.

06:19.718 --> 06:21.419
You guys both know each
other, so that's cool.

06:21.453 --> 06:22.920
Our dads sell furniture together.

06:22.955 --> 06:24.989
More like they avoid our moms together.

06:25.024 --> 06:26.491
You'll make a great Juliet.

06:27.860 --> 06:30.895
So, I have to ask...
How'd you beat out Andrew Gallery?

06:30.929 --> 06:33.131
If I had to guess,
pure unbridled talent.

06:33.165 --> 06:34.232
Wrong.

06:34.266 --> 06:37.301
In the play, Romeo is a
confused 15-year-old.

06:37.336 --> 06:39.137
I thought Adam would be perfect

06:39.171 --> 06:42.306
because he still has
the wildly underdeveloped body

06:42.341 --> 06:44.475
and crude acting of a young boy.

06:44.510 --> 06:46.809
- You honor me.
- Mm.

06:46.871 --> 06:47.891
And a heads-up.

06:47.915 --> 06:49.781
My dad's not too thrilled
about me doing this play.

06:49.782 --> 06:51.983
Oh, I know. But as a romantic lead,

06:52.017 --> 06:54.118
I'm prepared to endure
the fury of an angry father.

06:54.153 --> 06:55.215
You're Romeo?

06:57.856 --> 07:00.725
But what about your whole
thing about handsy Romeos

07:00.759 --> 07:02.427
smooching up your little princess?

07:03.696 --> 07:05.730
You understand. You're not a Romeo.

07:05.764 --> 07:08.199
I was literally cast as Romeo.

07:08.233 --> 07:10.268
<i>I couldn't stand that Vic and my dad</i>

07:10.302 --> 07:11.869
<i>thought I wasn't a leading man.</i>

07:11.904 --> 07:13.705
<i>Meanwhile, my sister
was leading the charge</i>

07:13.739 --> 07:15.339
<i>to protect her friendship with Ren.</i>

07:15.374 --> 07:17.041
Mom and Dad can't come
to Parents Weekend.

07:17.076 --> 07:18.943
Absolutely not!

07:18.977 --> 07:20.745
Also, why not?

07:20.779 --> 07:22.113
If tacky, horrible Mom shows up,

07:22.147 --> 07:23.981
Ren will never talk to me again.

07:24.016 --> 07:25.850
Ha! The friendship you care about

07:25.884 --> 07:28.386
hinges on the paper-thin premise
you can hide Mom forever.

07:28.420 --> 07:29.887
This is bad for you, too.

07:29.922 --> 07:31.756
Do you think potential
girlfriends on this campus

07:31.790 --> 07:33.662
will respond well to Beverly Goldberg?

07:33.701 --> 07:35.226
Oh, no!

07:35.260 --> 07:37.495
You brought it around to me,
and now I'm invested.

07:37.529 --> 07:38.596
What do we do?

07:38.630 --> 07:40.298
Parents Weekend starts Saturday.

07:40.332 --> 07:41.365
What if it didn't?

07:41.400 --> 07:42.633
Parents Thursday?

07:42.668 --> 07:43.868
The hell's Parents Thursday?

07:43.902 --> 07:46.370
Parents Thursday
replaces Parents Weekend

07:46.405 --> 07:48.639
due to an emergency campus renovation.

07:48.674 --> 07:50.308
- Is the tuition going up?
- No.

07:50.342 --> 07:52.009
- Suckers.
- Silver lining...

07:52.044 --> 07:54.479
We have a small window of time
this upcoming Thursday.

07:54.513 --> 07:55.913
Evening. After dark.

07:55.948 --> 07:57.467
- We'll make it work.
- I'm out.

07:57.501 --> 07:58.759
You know I don't drive after dark

07:58.784 --> 08:00.017
unless I like the place I'm going.

08:00.052 --> 08:02.120
Rats. Well, Mom, keep in mind

08:02.154 --> 08:03.654
that this event is super last-minute,

08:03.689 --> 08:05.690
so most parents won't be there.

08:05.724 --> 08:06.824
Lucky me.

08:06.859 --> 08:10.394
I get my college schmoos and
their campus all to myself.

08:10.429 --> 08:12.730
<i>And with that,
Parents Thursday was a go.</i>

08:12.765 --> 08:16.167
<i>It all kicked off at the ladies'
field hockey equipment closet.</i>

08:16.201 --> 08:18.612
If we had a key,
you'd see a lot of sticks.

08:18.659 --> 08:19.675
Moving on.

08:19.722 --> 08:22.909
<i>And they did, to a sketchy burrito
joint nine miles from campus.</i>

08:22.941 --> 08:23.975
We come here all the time.

08:25.611 --> 08:26.878
What the hell is a "kimi-conga"?

08:26.912 --> 08:28.780
<i>Of course, no school tour is complete</i>

08:28.814 --> 08:30.764
<i>without a stop at the dorm
facilities room.</i>

08:30.796 --> 08:32.216
I push these buttons all the time.

08:32.251 --> 08:34.950
Beep, boop, beep, boop.

08:34.975 --> 08:37.655
And the final stop of our
Parents Thursday tour,

08:37.688 --> 08:39.724
the majestic parking lot.

08:39.758 --> 08:40.957
All right, see you at Thanksgiving.

08:40.993 --> 08:42.626
Oh. Okay.

08:42.660 --> 08:46.197
<i>Success! Erica
and Barry had pulled it off.</i>

08:46.231 --> 08:47.265
<i>Or not.</i>

08:47.299 --> 08:49.600
Parents [bleep] Thursday? Really?

08:49.635 --> 08:50.768
- She knows.
- You know?

08:50.803 --> 08:52.103
Of course I know.

08:52.137 --> 08:53.504
Erica made me do it!

08:53.539 --> 08:55.259
She's the mastermind.

08:55.284 --> 08:57.503
Barry good. Erica bad.

08:57.565 --> 08:59.784
Mom, look, it's not a big deal.

08:59.818 --> 09:02.787
I just don't really want you here.
You get it.

09:04.389 --> 09:06.123
I guess I do.

09:06.158 --> 09:07.225
I accept it.

09:07.259 --> 09:09.961
What? But you never just accept it.

09:09.995 --> 09:11.462
Good evening, gentle daughter.

09:11.496 --> 09:13.464
No, don't be cordial.

09:13.498 --> 09:15.833
What's your next move, lady?
I need to know!

09:15.868 --> 09:18.803
Oh, no, this is terrible!
She has my burrito in her car!

09:18.837 --> 09:20.504
<i>Erica knew something was up with my mom.</i>

09:20.539 --> 09:24.375
<i>Meanwhile, Romeo's big kiss with
Juliet was about to go down.</i>

09:24.409 --> 09:27.812
Saints do not move, though
grant for prayers' sake.

09:27.846 --> 09:30.848
Then move not,
while my prayer's effect...

09:30.883 --> 09:32.183
I take.

09:33.452 --> 09:36.354
<i>My kiss with Asha
got a little hot and heavy.</i>

09:36.388 --> 09:37.855
<i>Okay, a lot.</i>

09:37.890 --> 09:39.624
<i>And I wasn't the only one
who felt that way.</i>

09:39.658 --> 09:40.691
Damn!

09:40.726 --> 09:42.326
Okay! All right! All right! No more!

09:42.361 --> 09:43.527
That's enough. That's enough.

09:43.562 --> 09:45.496
Adam, I knew you were the right choice,

09:45.530 --> 09:48.065
because that was sensuous.

09:48.100 --> 09:49.166
Thanks, I think.

09:49.201 --> 09:50.635
We're children, so it's a little weird.

09:50.669 --> 09:52.870
It was spicy, like a Cuban night.

09:52.905 --> 09:54.038
That's not much better.

09:54.072 --> 09:56.240
I mean, it's like I just
came out of a Turkish sauna!

09:56.275 --> 09:58.409
Uh, would you mind if we
took that from the top?

09:58.443 --> 09:59.911
I'd love another shot.

09:59.945 --> 10:01.646
Or we could just move on, maybe.

10:01.680 --> 10:03.014
That's a good idea, Lady Montague.

10:03.048 --> 10:04.515
Let's take ten and regroup.

10:04.549 --> 10:07.218
I need to air out
my directing scarf. Whoo!

10:07.252 --> 10:09.954
Dude, this is better than
you could have ever imagined.

10:09.988 --> 10:11.522
All the kissing's making Dana crazy,

10:11.556 --> 10:13.291
and Asha's clearly into you now, too.

10:13.325 --> 10:15.593
- You think Asha's into me?
- Have you seen her notebook?

10:15.627 --> 10:17.929
- It's got "AG" written all over it.
- I'm "AG."

10:17.963 --> 10:19.430
I only signed up for this play

10:19.464 --> 10:21.465
to stop Dana from kissing
that handsome douche,

10:21.500 --> 10:23.367
and now I'm the handsome douche.

10:23.402 --> 10:25.836
You're gonna be
a theater department legend,

10:25.871 --> 10:26.938
right up there with that guy

10:26.972 --> 10:28.539
who freed all the cats during <i>Cats,</i>

10:28.573 --> 10:30.007
and then they couldn't
catch all the cats,

10:30.042 --> 10:31.375
so now we can't do <i>Cats</i> anymore.

10:31.410 --> 10:33.711
Take that, Vic and Dad. I am a threat.

10:33.745 --> 10:36.814
Hey, Susie. I just popped
by to pick up Asha.

10:36.848 --> 10:38.282
How's the play going?

10:38.317 --> 10:41.118
Well, let's just say
that Romeo and Juliet

10:41.153 --> 10:43.955
are taking advantage of their
very palpable chemistry.

10:43.989 --> 10:46.324
- Palpable?
- I know. Seems unlikely.

10:46.358 --> 10:48.125
Asha and Goldberg's kid?

10:48.160 --> 10:49.860
Let's just say when I closed
my eyes and opened them,

10:49.895 --> 10:52.630
I was in Verona, and true
love was in the air.

10:52.664 --> 10:53.764
Nuh-uh!

10:53.799 --> 10:58.952
Asha's involvement in this
burlesque show is a big no!

11:00.484 --> 11:01.624
Oh, boy.

11:01.890 --> 11:04.457
<i>After finding out about
our hot and heavy rehearsal,</i>

11:04.528 --> 11:06.582
<i>Vic was living out his own tragedy.</i>

11:06.621 --> 11:10.332
So, it's been brought to my
attention that Ms. Cinoman

11:10.367 --> 11:15.208
has decided to put on an R-rated
version of <i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>

11:15.240 --> 11:16.640
It's just a kiss.

11:16.675 --> 11:18.242
That is not how you described it.

11:18.276 --> 11:21.645
The heat around them
made the air buckle.

11:21.680 --> 11:23.914
See? Teenage air-buckling and whatnot.

11:23.949 --> 11:25.015
Whatnot!

11:25.050 --> 11:26.350
Excuse me. Why am I here?

11:26.384 --> 11:29.520
Because your child is a
wolf in sheep's clothing.

11:29.554 --> 11:31.155
Cinoman confirmed.

11:31.189 --> 11:33.557
- Turbulent blood did fill my heart.
- Damn it, Mur.

11:33.592 --> 11:35.826
You agreed your son wasn't a threat.

11:35.860 --> 11:40.497
We even shared a chuckle about
how wildly unmasculine he is.

11:40.532 --> 11:42.912
Well, maybe the problem isn't my son.

11:42.959 --> 11:43.968
It's your daughter.

11:44.002 --> 11:46.136
Asha was attacked
by that four-eyed dorkus.

11:46.171 --> 11:47.871
Whoa! "Dorkus"?

11:47.906 --> 11:49.139
Oh, you heard me.

11:49.174 --> 11:51.242
The kid is a doof.

11:51.276 --> 11:53.143
I should really jump in here,

11:53.178 --> 11:55.045
or just see where this is going.

11:55.080 --> 11:58.449
I forbid your son from
stage-Frenching my daughter!

11:58.483 --> 12:02.253
I forbid your daughter
from stage-Frenching my son!

12:02.287 --> 12:05.289
Is anyone else picking up on
the irony of this situation?

12:05.323 --> 12:08.325
Rival families torn apart
by their children's love.

12:08.360 --> 12:10.427
Just say the words, Susan.

12:10.462 --> 12:12.496
This is <i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>

12:12.530 --> 12:15.032
- Nobody's ever heard of that show.
- What are you even talking about?

12:15.066 --> 12:17.901
I demand you cancel the
play, Principal Bald.

12:17.936 --> 12:19.270
It's Ball.

12:19.304 --> 12:20.638
And I would if I could,

12:20.672 --> 12:23.741
but the community-service kids
are already painting sets.

12:23.775 --> 12:27.144
Then I demand you remove
all the romance kissing

12:27.178 --> 12:28.712
and... and... and randy language.

12:28.747 --> 12:29.980
I could do that.

12:30.015 --> 12:32.383
Earl! You can't rewrite Shakespeare!

12:32.417 --> 12:35.352
One would think, but look at me go.

12:35.387 --> 12:36.687
Bye-bye, that bit.

12:36.721 --> 12:38.555
Please. Now they're
just star-crossed pals?

12:38.590 --> 12:42.459
Let's play it safe and make 'em
star-crossed business colleagues.

12:42.494 --> 12:45.062
<i>And so it would be a
romance-free Romeo and Juliet.</i>

12:45.096 --> 12:47.598
<i>Meanwhile, my sister knew
my mom wouldn't let her free</i>

12:47.632 --> 12:49.133
<i>on Parents Weekend that easily.</i>

12:49.167 --> 12:51.602
Okay, if I make this, I live forever

12:51.636 --> 12:54.171
and Dian Parkinson
from <i>The Price is Right</i>

12:54.205 --> 12:55.439
becomes my live-in girlfriend.

12:56.408 --> 12:57.675
Aw! Doesn't count!

12:57.709 --> 12:58.909
Will you shut up?

12:58.943 --> 13:00.244
Okay, shouldn't you be celebrating?

13:00.278 --> 13:01.812
You don't have to spend
the weekend with Mom.

13:01.846 --> 13:04.948
No! You think that she's just
gonna let Parents Thursday go?

13:04.983 --> 13:06.750
She's coming for me. She's coming hard.

13:06.785 --> 13:08.419
It's your mama!

13:08.453 --> 13:09.687
Lady Vengeance has come.

13:09.721 --> 13:11.322
Oh, no. Your dread was justified.

13:11.356 --> 13:13.524
Happy Parents Weekend.

13:13.558 --> 13:14.958
Erica said you were upset,

13:14.993 --> 13:17.361
but your wrapped gifts
and cheery tone say otherwise.

13:17.395 --> 13:19.163
Not buying it. What's your game, Mom?

13:19.197 --> 13:22.032
I am a mom, strange girl,
just not yours.

13:22.067 --> 13:24.101
She's pretending to not be
your mom to get back at you.

13:24.135 --> 13:25.836
- Yeah, thanks, Geoff. Good add.
- Uh-huh.

13:25.870 --> 13:27.971
I'm just here to celebrate
Parents Weekend

13:28.006 --> 13:31.008
with my one child
who attends this university.

13:31.042 --> 13:33.644
She's wearing a sweater that's
so sparkly and vindictive.

13:33.678 --> 13:35.779
Why are you just saying the
things we can all see?

13:35.814 --> 13:38.515
And you should know that
I'm not done by a long shot.

13:38.550 --> 13:41.585
Whatever. Your lame attempt
to divide us won't work.

13:41.619 --> 13:43.987
The sibling bond is stronger than any...

13:44.022 --> 13:45.289
What the hell, dude?

13:45.323 --> 13:47.691
Sorry, strange girl, but material goods

13:47.726 --> 13:49.660
and homemade treats have won me over.

13:49.694 --> 13:50.994
These have peanut butter!

13:51.029 --> 13:52.245
And butterscotch.

13:52.292 --> 13:54.737
Who's ready to be spoiled by Mama?

13:54.784 --> 13:56.166
Me.

13:56.201 --> 13:58.202
Just know, no matter how hard you try,

13:58.236 --> 14:00.003
you will never make me jealous.

14:00.038 --> 14:01.472
<i>And try my mom did.</i>

14:01.506 --> 14:04.541
Look! Mom foolishly
got me a bank account.

14:04.576 --> 14:06.643
Mom got me more fancy horse shirts

14:06.678 --> 14:08.011
than one boy could ever need.

14:08.046 --> 14:10.180
Mom got me a semester's
worth of frozen pizza.

14:10.215 --> 14:11.915
<i>And the gifts only got
bigger from there.</i>

14:11.950 --> 14:14.051
Oh, Parents Weekend is the best.

14:14.085 --> 14:15.486
I got a pinball machine

14:15.520 --> 14:17.488
that makes it nearly
impossible to open my closet.

14:17.522 --> 14:19.857
Your feeble attempt to make me feel bad

14:19.891 --> 14:21.592
is sad and will bankrupt your husband.

14:21.626 --> 14:22.860
Do you hear something, Barry,

14:22.894 --> 14:24.895
something squeaky and unappreciative?

14:24.929 --> 14:26.497
That was Erica. She's there.

14:26.531 --> 14:27.865
And you know what else?

14:27.899 --> 14:29.767
I'm hanging out with my new friend Ren,

14:29.801 --> 14:32.136
who has cool, not-crazy parents.

14:32.170 --> 14:33.704
Stupid family-sized fridge.

14:33.738 --> 14:36.306
Okay, people, please
refer to the changes

14:36.341 --> 14:40.711
in <i>Romeo and Juliet: A Tale
of Platonic Office Associates.</i>

14:40.745 --> 14:41.912
But soft!

14:41.946 --> 14:44.281
What light through yonder window breaks?

14:44.315 --> 14:48.185
It is the east, and my... pal
from accounting is the sun.

14:48.219 --> 14:52.222
Parting with my bud over in H.R.
is such sweet sorrow,

14:52.257 --> 14:56.004
that I shall say good night
till it be morrow... bud.

14:59.431 --> 15:01.064
What do they even do at this office?

15:01.099 --> 15:02.366
General business.

15:02.400 --> 15:04.168
Now, stop asking questions

15:04.202 --> 15:06.537
and start stealing Tybalt's
yogurt from the break room.

15:06.571 --> 15:08.038
I'm too handsome for this.

15:08.072 --> 15:09.173
- I'm out.
- No!

15:09.207 --> 15:11.442
We can't lose our Mercutio,
the mid-level executive!

15:11.476 --> 15:13.071
Yeah, I quit, too.

15:13.096 --> 15:14.563
<i>My showmance was slipping away.</i>

15:14.587 --> 15:15.712
<i>I had to do something.</i>

15:15.737 --> 15:17.247
Asha, wait.

15:17.282 --> 15:19.583
I'm really sorry about how
our dads ruined Shakespeare.

15:19.617 --> 15:21.251
Yeah, they're the worst.

15:21.286 --> 15:23.454
- But I still think you should do it.
- What's the point?

15:23.488 --> 15:25.122
Well, even though they cut our kiss,

15:25.156 --> 15:27.257
we can still share...

15:27.292 --> 15:28.358
Whatever this is.

15:28.393 --> 15:29.414
This?

15:29.994 --> 15:31.061
Our chemistry.

15:31.095 --> 15:33.730
Wait. Wait. Wait.
Do you think I'm into you?

15:33.765 --> 15:35.232
- You're not?
- No.

15:35.266 --> 15:37.134
But you wrote "AG"
all over your notebook.

15:37.669 --> 15:38.869
Andrew Gallery?

15:38.903 --> 15:41.939
Huh. I guess I'm not the only
person with my initials.

15:41.973 --> 15:44.174
I'm so sorry, Adam.

15:44.209 --> 15:45.843
<i>And then it got even worse.</i>

15:45.877 --> 15:48.278
Hey! Guess who's your new Juliet.

15:48.313 --> 15:49.880
Oh, cool.

15:50.915 --> 15:53.083
Oh, I thought you'd be more excited.

15:53.117 --> 15:54.952
I'm sorry. I'm just... Forget it.

15:54.986 --> 15:56.553
It's about someone else.

15:56.588 --> 15:59.623
Yeah. I'm getting that feeling.

15:59.657 --> 16:01.959
<i>While both of my showmances
quickly fell apart,</i>

16:01.993 --> 16:04.828
<i>my mom was still determined to
break Erica on Parents Weekend.</i>

16:04.863 --> 16:07.631
Excuse me, random coeds.
Are these seats taken?

16:07.665 --> 16:09.867
Oh, God. Yes. They're very much taken.

16:09.901 --> 16:12.069
I'm sorry. My... My parents are coming.

16:12.103 --> 16:14.371
Oh, that's fine. We'll just
sit here until they arrive.

16:14.405 --> 16:15.772
Barry, over here.

16:15.807 --> 16:17.140
Wait. Isn't that your brother?

16:17.175 --> 16:19.276
Is it? No, I think I would know.

16:19.310 --> 16:20.744
I told Mom where you were.

16:20.778 --> 16:22.513
She bought me a snowmobile.

16:22.547 --> 16:25.148
I'm sorry. I am so confused.

16:25.183 --> 16:26.850
It's a vehicle you drive on snow.

16:26.885 --> 16:28.452
It's right there in the name.

16:28.486 --> 16:30.120
Uh, no. This is your mom?

16:30.154 --> 16:32.155
I-I thought you were lost at sea.

16:32.190 --> 16:34.391
I'm lost at sea?

16:34.425 --> 16:36.226
Yes, because it's better
than the truth...

16:36.261 --> 16:39.029
That you're a crazy person
intent on ruining my life.

16:39.063 --> 16:41.498
Wow. You'd rather have my lifeless body

16:41.533 --> 16:42.633
bobbing in the ocean

16:42.667 --> 16:45.435
than spend one lousy day
with me at your college?

16:45.470 --> 16:46.870
Let's go, Barry.

16:48.172 --> 16:50.841
Mom, is my burrito still in your car?

16:50.875 --> 16:52.009
I'm sorry about that.

16:52.043 --> 16:55.112
My mom is just always on top of me.

16:55.146 --> 16:58.248
With the visits and constant
attention, it's too much.

16:58.283 --> 17:01.118
Well, my parents aren't even here.

17:01.152 --> 17:03.487
At least you get along,
and, you know, they're cool.

17:03.521 --> 17:06.857
So cool they forgot to even show up.

17:06.891 --> 17:08.191
Wait. They're not coming?

17:08.226 --> 17:09.792
This happens all the time

17:09.827 --> 17:13.363
'cause funny thing is
that they don't care.

17:13.397 --> 17:16.330
But clearly your mom does.

17:16.356 --> 17:18.402
I don't think you know
how good you have it.

17:25.353 --> 17:27.196
<i>After being driven away by Erica,</i>

17:27.268 --> 17:30.065
<i>my mom was wrapping up the
worst Parents Weekend ever.</i>

17:30.152 --> 17:31.852
Pinball! Pinball! Pinball!

17:31.887 --> 17:33.387
Pinball! Pinball! Yes!

17:33.421 --> 17:35.856
Barry! It's a lot.

17:35.928 --> 17:38.429
I know. I almost broke my
high score from this morning.

17:39.894 --> 17:41.428
Oh, don't worry. I'm just leaving.

17:41.463 --> 17:44.657
- Mom, stay.
- Pinball! Pinball! Yes!

17:44.699 --> 17:47.635
I never should've made up
Parents Thursday.

17:47.669 --> 17:50.671
Not to mention the whole
"lost at sea" thing.

17:50.705 --> 17:52.473
That was a nice touch.

17:52.507 --> 17:55.142
Look, it took me a long time to
make my first college friend,

17:55.177 --> 17:56.846
and I was worried you'd scare her off.

17:57.712 --> 17:58.979
Scare her off?

17:59.014 --> 18:01.466
You can be... overwhelming.

18:01.491 --> 18:02.850
Pinball! Pinball! Pinball! Yes!

18:02.884 --> 18:05.386
- Damn it, Barry.
- I'm taking the pinball away.

18:05.420 --> 18:08.122
I know, but you not
wanting me in your life

18:08.156 --> 18:10.491
is the worst pain a mama can have.

18:10.525 --> 18:12.460
I'm sorry.

18:12.494 --> 18:15.696
And the truth is,
I love how much you care,

18:15.730 --> 18:17.898
even if sometimes it's a lot.

18:17.933 --> 18:18.966
Really?

18:19.568 --> 18:20.801
More than you know.

18:22.070 --> 18:24.572
So, Parents Weekend isn't over.

18:24.606 --> 18:27.374
Maybe you want to grab dinner
with me and my new friend Ren?

18:28.143 --> 18:30.010
That would be perfect.

18:31.713 --> 18:33.013
<i>It's easy to be scared</i>

18:33.048 --> 18:35.182
<i>of pushing someone new
in your life away.</i>

18:35.207 --> 18:37.752
<i>But then you remember
the people closest to you</i>

18:37.777 --> 18:38.993
<i>will always back you up.</i>

18:39.018 --> 18:42.389
Hey, uh, shouldn't you be putting
on the tights or whatever?

18:42.424 --> 18:44.158
I'm not doing the dumb play.

18:44.192 --> 18:46.794
- Why not?
- Asha was just using me.

18:46.828 --> 18:49.263
Then I screwed up with Dana.
Now I got nothing.

18:52.467 --> 18:54.602
You know, I read this thing.

18:54.636 --> 18:56.704
You read <i>Romeo and Juliet?</i>

18:56.738 --> 18:59.273
There's only one difference
between you and Romeo.

18:59.307 --> 19:01.208
He had his heart set on one girl.

19:01.243 --> 19:03.511
I guess I did get a little carried away.

19:03.545 --> 19:05.913
Yeah. Young love is difficult.

19:05.947 --> 19:07.214
Totally.

19:07.249 --> 19:09.583
If you stay patient,
you'll meet your Juliet.

19:11.553 --> 19:12.520
Thanks, Dad.

19:13.455 --> 19:15.222
Also, I talked to Principal Ball.

19:15.257 --> 19:17.725
He's gonna let the play go back
to the original Shakespeare.

19:17.759 --> 19:19.460
You did that? Why?

19:19.494 --> 19:22.796
Because my son is starring as Romeo,

19:22.831 --> 19:24.932
and I wouldn't miss that for anything.

19:26.902 --> 19:28.619
<i>That night, my dad convinced me</i>

19:28.643 --> 19:29.813
<i>I could be a leading man.</i>

19:29.838 --> 19:32.606
I just had to remember why
I did this in the first place.

19:32.641 --> 19:33.941
Hey.

19:33.975 --> 19:35.342
Hey.

19:36.845 --> 19:38.479
Look, I'm sorry.

19:38.513 --> 19:40.881
I didn't mean to make you
feel like some runner-up.

19:40.916 --> 19:42.616
Whatever. I get it.

19:42.651 --> 19:44.652
The truth is, I only
tried out for the play

19:44.686 --> 19:46.320
so you wouldn't end up
with Andrew Gallery.

19:47.022 --> 19:48.055
Really?

19:48.089 --> 19:49.623
It's stupid, I know.

19:49.658 --> 19:51.692
No, it's sweet.

19:51.726 --> 19:52.993
And if we're being honest,

19:53.028 --> 19:55.996
seeing you kiss Asha made me
extra bummed I wasn't Juliet.

19:57.232 --> 19:58.899
All right, places!
Places, everyone! Come on!

19:58.934 --> 20:01.669
Oh, crap! We're not in business casual?

20:03.888 --> 20:05.261
Guess I'll see you out there.

20:05.333 --> 20:06.846
- Break a leg.
- You too.

20:06.916 --> 20:09.228
<i>Life has a funny
way of bringing familiar faces</i>

20:09.253 --> 20:11.807
<i>back into our lives
right when we need it most.</i>

20:11.832 --> 20:13.439
<i>And then there's those new faces</i>

20:13.464 --> 20:15.197
<i>who can help make our lives complete.</i>

20:16.546 --> 20:19.214
<i>I'd waited three long years
to kiss Dana again.</i>

20:19.239 --> 20:22.110
<i>If we were meant to be,
this moment would say it all.</i>

20:24.412 --> 20:26.902
<i>And I didn't feel anything.</i>

20:26.967 --> 20:28.067
Oof.

20:28.109 --> 20:29.668
That's a swing and a miss.

20:29.693 --> 20:31.043
<i>Shakespeare was right.</i>

20:31.085 --> 20:33.841
<i>Young love is totally complicated.</i>

20:33.948 --> 20:36.919
<i>And I was a long way
from figuring it out.</i>

20:44.324 --> 20:46.455
_

20:46.536 --> 20:48.619
Then I defy you, stars!

20:48.701 --> 20:50.835
Thus with a kiss...

20:55.711 --> 20:57.797
- Gah!
- I'm here to apologize

20:57.860 --> 21:00.281
I may have said some
untoward things about you.

21:00.367 --> 21:03.730
Being a goober, a spaz,
a weenie, a total buttweed.

21:03.777 --> 21:05.144
Yeah. I don't need a whole recap.

21:05.178 --> 21:07.947
I also said that your flimsy,
unformed child body

21:07.981 --> 21:10.616
was not only shapeless,
but weak and gross.

21:10.650 --> 21:11.784
I kinda have to get to class.

21:11.818 --> 21:14.787
Additionally, I spoke of
your manly prowess as a joke.

21:14.821 --> 21:16.188
You know who you should really meet?

21:16.222 --> 21:17.489
Asha! Andrew!

21:18.925 --> 21:21.339
Well, who in the hell
is this smiling simpleton?

21:21.364 --> 21:23.065
Okay, then. You three have fun.
