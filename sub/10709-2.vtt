00:11.200 --> 00:12.700
Just give me
the necklace.

00:40.433 --> 00:42.999
Mari.
Mari?

00:44.733 --> 00:45.733
Are you okay?

00:46.833 --> 00:49.466
VIXEN S01E02

00:51.066 --> 00:52.266
Are you sure you want coffee?

00:52.800 --> 00:53.766
After what happened,

00:53.766 --> 00:55.466
thought would want something to eat.

00:56.066 --> 00:57.266
Only the coffee is good
.

00:57.900 --> 00:58.933
Thanks, Chuck
.

01:01.366 --> 01:02.999
I'm exhausted.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.566
If you want to stay, I hope that it
,

01:05.566 --> 01:06.932
your room is as left.

01:26.500 --> 01:28.600
The school girls...

01:28.600 --> 01:31.200
said my mother was a junkie.

01:31.900 --> 01:33.666
That's why she dumped me
.

01:34.900 --> 01:36.600
What is a person
drugged?

01:36.600 --> 01:39.400
No matter, anyway
not true.

01:39.400 --> 01:41.700
These girls were just
trying to bother you.

01:43.500 --> 01:45.900
Why my mother
dumped me?

01:46.633 --> 01:47.766
You were just a baby
,

01:47.766 --> 01:50.032
when the adoption service
brought you to us.

01:50.466 --> 01:52.166
You did not even have a name
.

01:53.033 --> 01:54.666
But you had something.

01:56.066 --> 01:57.966
One thing I was hoping you mature

01:57.966 --> 01:59.566
to be able to give you.

02:09.000 --> 02:09.866
What is this?

02:10.000 --> 02:11.466
Belonged to his mother.

02:12.066 --> 02:14.099
Chuck asked a
friends with him about what it was,

02:14.100 --> 02:15.800
And she said it was
a 'Totem Anansi. "

02:15.800 --> 02:16.866
What does it mean?

02:16.866 --> 02:17.932
I do not know, dear
.

02:18.400 --> 02:21.033
But envision that one day
,

02:21.033 --> 02:24.033
that will help you get your answers.

02:38.100 --> 02:39.700
Dr. Macalester?

02:39.700 --> 02:41.633
Opening hours
is just 20 minutes.

02:42.400 --> 02:44.800
I'm Mari McCabe.
I called earlier.

02:45.200 --> 02:47.200
Sure,
my apologies.

02:47.200 --> 02:47.900
In.

02:48.533 --> 02:51.266
He said he had an artifact
for me to have a look.

02:51.266 --> 02:51.999
That's right,

02:52.333 --> 02:55.633
but not sure
that is an artifact.

02:58.633 --> 03:01.133
Normally at that time
is when I say:

03:01.133 --> 03:02.466
"My eyes are here
up."

03:03.466 --> 03:06.299
That's fantastic...
!

03:06.300 --> 03:07.400
Where did you find?

03:07.700 --> 03:10.033
I guess you could say
that is a family heirloom.

03:10.033 --> 03:13.233
I do not know anything about it,
even where it is.

03:13.233 --> 03:15.199
This type of stone is indigenous

03:15.200 --> 03:17.433
the province of M-Changa,
Zambesi.

03:17.433 --> 03:19.599
And it has something to do with "Anansi"
is not it?

03:19.900 --> 03:22.100
Anansi. The trickster god.

03:22.266 --> 03:23.232
As legend has it,

03:23.233 --> 03:26.366
- he created a totem, which gave a...
- Warrior called Tantu.

03:27.266 --> 03:28.132
When I was a kid,

03:28.133 --> 03:30.499
I looked about "Anansi"
in an encyclopedia.

03:30.500 --> 03:31.600
I'm sorry for wasting your time
.

03:31.600 --> 03:35.100
I honestly did not know
what you find when I came here.

03:35.100 --> 03:36.333
What did you want to find out?

03:38.500 --> 03:41.266
I do not know.
You idiot.

03:41.300 --> 03:43.400
Well, I have 3
graduates formations, so...

03:43.400 --> 03:45.733
How about letting me judge
it is stupid or not?

03:46.933 --> 03:49.533
I have it
since I was 10,

03:49.533 --> 03:51.766
and always thought it was
one jewelry.

03:52.133 --> 03:55.599
But recently, some
things happened to me.

03:55.600 --> 03:57.200
And I think that's the key for me

03:57.200 --> 03:59.166
find out about my family.

03:59.166 --> 04:00.199
Who is your family?

04:00.866 --> 04:03.566
That's the question
worth 52 million dollars.

04:04.166 --> 04:06.032
Sorry to waste your time.

04:06.033 --> 04:09.399
It says the totem
gives access to the "Axe"

04:09.400 --> 04:10.400
the animal kingdom.

04:10.633 --> 04:13.399
This is life force,

04:13.400 --> 04:14.633
power

04:14.633 --> 04:15.866
essence.

04:15.866 --> 04:18.266
The amulet provides
"Axe" of any animal

04:18.266 --> 04:19.632
that conjure.

04:19.766 --> 04:20.599
What?

04:20.600 --> 04:21.833
Type, you know...

04:21.833 --> 04:24.733
speed of a cheetah,
agility of an antelope,

04:25.366 --> 04:27.099
strength of an elephant, etc.

04:29.366 --> 04:31.966
Relax, all this does not pass
myths.

04:32.066 --> 04:35.132
In fact, this pendant
not just a piece of polished stone.

04:35.600 --> 04:37.200
Too bad,

04:37.200 --> 04:40.233
if it were magic
I could sell it on the internet.

04:40.700 --> 04:42.066
Thanks for your time.

04:48.400 --> 04:49.766
You know McCabe?

04:49.766 --> 04:52.299
The woman who defeated the three marginal
you hired

04:52.300 --> 04:53.633
to steal the amulet Anansi
it.

04:53.966 --> 04:55.666
She just came out of my office
.

04:55.733 --> 04:58.933
This is certainly
a turnaround.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.899
Can I bring her here always
you want.

05:00.900 --> 05:02.133
But in return...

05:02.133 --> 05:04.066
Relax, Dr. Macalester.

05:04.066 --> 05:06.132
Once you have the amulet
at hand,

05:06.133 --> 05:09.733
Can consider your next
expedition fully covered.

05:09.733 --> 05:12.633
And the girl?
What will happen to her?

05:12.633 --> 05:15.566
Do not worry about
Mari McCabe, professor.

05:15.566 --> 05:17.166
I need her alive,

05:17.400 --> 05:18.300
yet.

05:19.305 --> 05:25.402
