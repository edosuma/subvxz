00:16.622 --> 00:17.891
<i>Revenge!</i>

00:18.058 --> 00:21.060
<i>Boba Fett, son of the notorious
bounty hunter Jango Fett,</i>

00:21.530 --> 00:23.435
<i>infiltrated a Jedi cruiser</i>

00:23.540 --> 00:26.332
<i>in an attempt
to assassinate General Mace Windu,</i>

00:26.416 --> 00:28.876
<i>the man who killed his father.</i>

00:29.208 --> 00:31.231
<i>After a near miss
at Windu's quarters,</i>

00:31.398 --> 00:33.794
<i>Boba was forced
to destroy the Jedi cruiser</i>

00:33.857 --> 00:37.549
<i>and escape with the help
of notorious bounty hunter Aurra Sing.</i>

00:38.558 --> 00:41.151
<i>Now, having lost contact
with Admiral Killian</i>

00:41.319 --> 00:43.389
<i>when his doomed starship crashed,</i>

00:43.513 --> 00:47.682
<i>the Jedi search for survivors
with the aid of a Republic rescue ship.</i>

00:51.573 --> 00:54.825
General Windu, we're picking up
the last of the survivors now.

00:54.991 --> 00:58.201
It's critical to get them to
a hospital station as soon as possible.

00:58.368 --> 01:01.577
We'll contact you as soon as our search
for Admiral Killian is complete.

01:03.412 --> 01:04.662
Let's go, R2.

01:14.327 --> 01:16.218
We're coming up on the crash site.

01:16.343 --> 01:20.211
Let's hope Admiral Killian
and the command crew are still in one piece.

01:25.895 --> 01:28.506
Looks pretty bad.
But the bridge seems to be intact.

01:28.674 --> 01:31.757
Set down behind the cruiser.
We'll approach on foot.

01:47.716 --> 01:49.296
You're not kidding, little buddy.

01:49.421 --> 01:51.267
I don't like
the feel of this place either.

01:51.433 --> 01:54.072
Your astro-mech
is programmed to feel?

01:54.197 --> 01:56.983
R2 is kind of a... special case.

01:57.685 --> 02:00.090
He's got a lot of personality,
that's all.

02:00.813 --> 02:02.689
You encourage it too much.

02:13.152 --> 02:16.232
R8, start scanning the area
for signs of life.

02:16.357 --> 02:18.505
And calculate an entry point
to the cruiser.

02:23.239 --> 02:25.907
You're right, R2,
it doesn't look good.

02:34.700 --> 02:37.662
- A bit jittery, isn't it?
- He must have seen something.

02:39.955 --> 02:42.914
Come on, it looks like R8 has found
an entry point.

02:49.710 --> 02:52.645
There would have been a command crew
left aboard to try and land this ship.

02:52.771 --> 02:55.991
Admiral Killian and then
at least three navigational officers.

02:56.116 --> 02:58.252
Commander Ponds stayed as well.

03:17.879 --> 03:19.963
What did you find, little guy?

03:20.967 --> 03:22.496
Mace! Over here!

03:29.205 --> 03:31.498
This man did not die in the crash.

03:31.623 --> 03:32.728
He was executed.

03:34.354 --> 03:36.856
There's another one over here.
Same thing.

03:37.602 --> 03:39.761
We know
the assassins were after me.

03:39.886 --> 03:42.233
Perhaps they returned
to look for my body.

03:42.400 --> 03:44.889
We need to get to the bridge
to find Admiral Killian.

03:45.013 --> 03:48.028
Send the droids
to scan for any survivors down here.

03:48.154 --> 03:49.820
Maybe the killer missed one.

03:50.426 --> 03:53.397
I know there's a lot of interference,
but do your best.

04:31.830 --> 04:33.028
They're dead.

04:33.354 --> 04:35.507
Executed like the troopers below.

04:37.565 --> 04:40.426
But I don't see Admiral Killian
or Commander Ponds.

04:40.592 --> 04:43.886
They must have been sucked into space
when the cabin lost pressure.

04:48.593 --> 04:50.847
<i>There's no sign
of any life down here.</i>

04:51.014 --> 04:54.516
<i>I'm afraid Admiral Killian
and Commander Ponds are lost.</i>

04:54.682 --> 04:56.891
Take the survivors
back to the hospital station.

04:57.059 --> 04:58.392
We'll meet you there.

04:58.559 --> 04:59.580
<i>Mace out.</i>

04:59.704 --> 05:01.262
Captain Silver out.

05:01.388 --> 05:03.311
Head for home.
Lightspeed.

06:01.285 --> 06:03.709
Is that a Mandalorian helmet?

06:12.577 --> 06:14.349
What is that doing here?

06:16.939 --> 06:18.417
Clone cadets.

06:21.578 --> 06:22.836
Jango Fett!

06:26.370 --> 06:27.308
Boba!

06:28.768 --> 06:30.435
Anakin, no!

06:31.184 --> 06:32.060
Drop it!

06:55.651 --> 06:56.849
Mace is dead.

06:57.545 --> 06:59.004
Are you happy now?

07:07.272 --> 07:08.778
I wanna make sure he's dead.

07:08.904 --> 07:11.770
There's nothing left of Windu
to find, Boba.

07:12.993 --> 07:14.898
I wanna get off this planet now.

07:16.529 --> 07:18.417
This place is crawling
with gundarks.

07:18.541 --> 07:22.589
And, besides, we've got these hostages
to drag along with us now.

07:22.755 --> 07:24.381
This extra baggage will fetch us

07:24.548 --> 07:26.800
a hefty sum from the Separatists.

07:27.839 --> 07:31.383
It's a lot of trouble
for not enough payout if you ask me.

07:32.102 --> 07:33.633
You haven't even done anything!

07:33.757 --> 07:36.538
- I've taken all the risks!
- Quiet, runt!

07:39.243 --> 07:41.431
I wouldn't do that.

07:44.300 --> 07:47.975
Count Dooku will pay us well
if we bring back the Jedi's head.

07:48.143 --> 07:50.539
Dooku might pay us for killing Windu.

07:51.134 --> 07:52.769
Then we're looking at a profit.

07:55.901 --> 07:56.938
Now relax.

07:57.632 --> 07:58.882
Boba is right.

07:59.235 --> 08:01.779
To get paid
we need proof of Windu's death.

08:01.903 --> 08:03.832
And if we killed Skywalker,

08:04.233 --> 08:05.775
we can ask for double.

08:06.970 --> 08:08.026
Double?

08:08.470 --> 08:10.673
Yes, but we need proof.

08:11.533 --> 08:14.241
Bossk, take care of our guests

08:14.366 --> 08:15.808
while we're gone.

08:48.094 --> 08:49.032
R2!

08:49.867 --> 08:50.909
Over here!

08:57.031 --> 08:58.673
Good to see you, buddy.

09:04.031 --> 09:05.260
Careful, R2.

09:05.427 --> 09:08.021
I'm afraid
the whole bridge will collapse.

09:08.147 --> 09:10.346
I need you
to go back to the fighters

09:10.513 --> 09:12.805
and call the Temple for help.
OK?

09:18.501 --> 09:19.648
Go get help.

09:20.438 --> 09:22.680
We'll hold out as long as we can.

09:23.078 --> 09:24.121
Go on, R2.

09:25.742 --> 09:26.784
Go on.

09:55.009 --> 09:55.843
Come on.

09:55.969 --> 09:57.701
We've gotta find Windu's body.

09:59.614 --> 10:00.994
Careful, Boba.

10:09.851 --> 10:11.790
Yeah, careful.

10:11.957 --> 10:14.823
I'd hate to only split the money
three ways.

10:41.861 --> 10:42.721
Look out!

10:47.858 --> 10:49.785
This place is a death trap!

10:50.391 --> 10:51.536
When I hired you,

10:51.662 --> 10:54.579
I didn't realize
that you were such a coward.

10:55.682 --> 10:57.662
Well, I don't wanna be next.

11:01.896 --> 11:04.356
- Blast!
- The door must have malfunctioned.

11:17.921 --> 11:19.071
Are you all right?

11:20.262 --> 11:21.807
Yeah, I'm OK.

11:22.528 --> 11:24.091
Except I can't move.

11:24.838 --> 11:25.991
Can you get free?

11:34.721 --> 11:36.337
I already tried that.

11:37.495 --> 11:39.408
You'll bring the whole place
down on us!

11:40.372 --> 11:44.165
How do we plan
on getting ourselves out of this mess?

11:44.511 --> 11:48.417
Don't worry, I already sent R2
back to the fighters to call for help.

11:48.584 --> 11:51.293
I'm sure
he has everything under control.

11:54.669 --> 11:56.587
I didn't know
there'd be all this climbing.

11:57.016 --> 12:00.172
Shut up! It wasn't my idea
to tag you along anyway.

12:00.338 --> 12:02.044
The next one who says anything

12:02.169 --> 12:04.424
will get a blaster bolt
through the brain.

12:22.120 --> 12:23.640
Incoming!

12:27.354 --> 12:28.605
What was that?

12:28.730 --> 12:31.102
The ship is falling apart around us.

12:31.953 --> 12:33.184
This is no good.

12:33.309 --> 12:35.438
If we can barely survive in here,

12:35.605 --> 12:37.692
Windu must have been killed
in the blast.

12:37.817 --> 12:41.065
I'm not quitting now,
not when I'm so close.

12:55.973 --> 12:56.948
Look out!

12:59.115 --> 13:00.866
We're running out of time.

13:03.104 --> 13:05.025
That's it!
We're out of here.

13:05.150 --> 13:06.952
No-one can survive this place.

13:07.119 --> 13:08.286
A Jedi could.

13:08.623 --> 13:12.076
I hate to agree with Castas,
but there's a better way to do this.

13:12.202 --> 13:13.452
But, Aurra...

13:19.291 --> 13:21.628
Bossk, fire up Slave 1.

13:22.282 --> 13:25.669
<i>We're going to blast
what's left of this ship to pieces.</i>

13:25.836 --> 13:28.462
I'll be ready when you arrive.

13:38.758 --> 13:40.336
I hate just sitting here!

13:40.460 --> 13:42.551
Calm yourself, Skywalker.

13:42.868 --> 13:45.998
We'll soon see
if the faith you put in that droid

13:46.123 --> 13:47.262
is worth it.

14:34.366 --> 14:35.534
What was that?

14:36.795 --> 14:39.250
Scanners picked up an explosion.

14:40.536 --> 14:42.537
<i>Near where the Jedi landed.</i>

14:42.746 --> 14:43.476
Windu!

14:43.579 --> 14:46.038
Jam any communications
off this planet.

15:08.786 --> 15:11.133
The fighter's markings
match Windu's.

15:11.300 --> 15:13.634
I knew it!
I told you he wasn't dead.

15:13.801 --> 15:15.469
Bossk, after him!

15:27.405 --> 15:29.541
I don't like the sound of that.

15:33.100 --> 15:36.371
I thought your astro-mech
was supposed to call for help,

15:36.497 --> 15:38.896
not take off and leave us here.

15:43.064 --> 15:45.908
Come on, R2,
I'm counting on ya.

16:03.180 --> 16:04.190
Hold it steady!

16:10.022 --> 16:12.527
We've knocked out
his communications.

16:24.928 --> 16:27.946
Two rings. Mark 35.
They're powering up.

16:28.071 --> 16:30.451
If we can take out the rings,
he'll be trapped.

16:31.003 --> 16:32.045
Which one?

16:32.453 --> 16:34.036
Destroy them both!

16:34.414 --> 16:35.925
We can't get range.

16:36.520 --> 16:38.761
You'll get one shot at this, kid.

16:44.541 --> 16:46.125
I've got you, Windu!

16:55.879 --> 16:57.656
There goes a fortune!

16:57.782 --> 16:59.506
Nice work, kid!

17:03.758 --> 17:05.534
What's our next move?

17:05.659 --> 17:08.301
Great!
This has gone well.

17:09.844 --> 17:13.471
Windu will be back here with a fleet.
He'll hunt us down.

17:13.825 --> 17:14.962
Don't count on it.

17:15.087 --> 17:17.119
The Jedi don't carry grudges.

17:19.604 --> 17:22.767
But I have ways of motivating him.

17:24.810 --> 17:28.853
We'll make Windu come to us next time
on our terms.

17:29.019 --> 17:31.771
Now let's get out of here.
I want to regroup.

17:50.571 --> 17:53.692
We shall reinforce our fleet
along the Hydian Way.

17:53.817 --> 17:55.485
This should prevent...

18:07.617 --> 18:08.454
Stop it!

18:09.955 --> 18:11.361
R2, what's wrong?

18:12.706 --> 18:15.165
Ahsoka, you know this droid?

18:15.332 --> 18:17.667
It's Anakin's droid, R2-D2.

18:18.116 --> 18:20.255
Well, then, R2,
deliver the message

18:20.380 --> 18:23.291
you so obviously
need to communicate.

18:25.606 --> 18:27.629
<i>I need you to
go back to the fighters</i>

18:27.796 --> 18:30.255
<i>and call the Temple for help.
OK?</i>

18:33.463 --> 18:34.788
Prepare my ship.

18:34.914 --> 18:36.841
We shall leave immediately.

18:49.530 --> 18:51.182
Whose helmet is that anyway?

18:51.508 --> 18:55.240
It belongs to a bounty hunter
I killed on Geonosis

18:55.364 --> 18:57.560
by the name of Jango Fett.

18:57.726 --> 19:00.603
You mean the clone template?

19:02.423 --> 19:04.862
Strangely enough, he had a son.

19:05.683 --> 19:08.392
Or at least a clone
he regarded as a son.

19:09.128 --> 19:11.024
His name is Boba Fett.

19:11.190 --> 19:12.967
I remember now.

19:13.093 --> 19:15.901
Obi-Wan listed him
in his report on Kamino.

19:16.365 --> 19:19.126
Boba was on Geonosis
when his father died.

19:19.903 --> 19:21.987
He watched as I killed him.

19:22.874 --> 19:24.947
That would complicate things.

19:25.565 --> 19:26.607
Indeed.

19:38.817 --> 19:41.594
Your astro-mech
has been gone too long.

19:41.720 --> 19:43.997
He must have failed
to deliver your message.

19:44.163 --> 19:45.779
R2 will come through.

20:04.631 --> 20:06.798
There! In the bridge.
I can see them.

20:08.216 --> 20:10.847
Ahsoka, hold the ship steady.

20:20.933 --> 20:21.973
Let's go!

20:25.766 --> 20:27.767
Hurry, Commander Wolf!

20:28.164 --> 20:29.434
Hold tight, General.

20:29.601 --> 20:31.018
We're losing it, sir.

20:38.730 --> 20:39.772
Jump!

20:41.880 --> 20:43.313
Cut the lines.

20:44.358 --> 20:45.358
Go!

21:03.764 --> 21:05.457
Some pretty serious burns,

21:05.581 --> 21:07.868
but nothing a night in a bacta tank
won't fix.

21:09.867 --> 21:10.775
Sorry.

21:10.899 --> 21:13.412
We were lucky to arrive when we did.

21:13.579 --> 21:15.923
Guess we have R2 to thank for that.

21:17.974 --> 21:19.290
Come here, droid.

21:22.240 --> 21:25.366
I can see why your master trusts you,
little one.

21:26.028 --> 21:27.069
Good job.

21:32.529 --> 21:34.880
That's definitely more praise
than I ever get.

22:06.780 --> 22:08.784
This isn't what I wanted.

22:13.671 --> 22:15.404
You don't have to do this.

22:15.507 --> 22:17.074
You're not like them.

22:17.178 --> 22:18.223
I can tell.

22:18.306 --> 22:19.976
What do you know, old man?

22:20.017 --> 22:22.982
I know a good soldier when I see one.

22:23.024 --> 22:24.257
I'm no soldier.

22:24.362 --> 22:26.679
I'm no clone, not like those two.

22:27.034 --> 22:27.785
What?

22:27.869 --> 22:29.414
What are you looking at?

22:29.497 --> 22:31.607
Boba, what's going on?

22:31.711 --> 22:33.715
Nothing.

22:38.392 --> 22:39.957
What are we gonna do with them?

22:40.062 --> 22:44.322
Oh, I think our friends here
are about to finally prove useful.

23:01.737 --> 23:06.246
So what are you planning to do
with this son of Jango Fett?

23:06.455 --> 23:08.919
I'm not planning to do anything.

23:08.961 --> 23:12.009
That kid destroyed an entire cruiser
trying to get to you,

23:12.051 --> 23:13.804
and you're just gonna let it go?

23:13.888 --> 23:17.311
Is there something else
I should be doing, Skywalker?

23:17.354 --> 23:19.567
How about tracking him down?

23:19.609 --> 23:21.947
So I should behave as this child does?

23:21.989 --> 23:23.911
I should seek revenge?

23:23.952 --> 23:25.288
No.

23:25.331 --> 23:29.381
How is it revenge if you stop this kid
and bring him to justice?

23:29.422 --> 23:33.473
In case you hadn't noticed,
we are fighting a war.

23:34.768 --> 23:36.752
We have a situation.

23:36.856 --> 23:39.843
We received a transmission
from the bounty hunters.

23:43.120 --> 23:45.689
They apparently took hostages.

23:47.505 --> 23:50.554
<i>Mace Windu,
you were lucky to escape.</i>

23:51.388 --> 23:54.062
<i>Your friends here
were not so fortunate.</i>

23:54.103 --> 23:58.487
<i>Until you face Boba,
these men will be killed one at a time.</i>

23:58.529 --> 24:00.492
<i>What's your name?</i>

24:00.950 --> 24:02.664
<i>Name!</i>

24:02.706 --> 24:04.919
<i>CT-411.</i>

24:05.211 --> 24:06.255
<i>Ugh, pathetic.</i>

24:06.296 --> 24:07.592
<i>Boba, do it.</i>

24:09.721 --> 24:11.038
<i>Boba!</i>

24:14.795 --> 24:16.151
It was Ponds.

24:16.695 --> 24:18.950
<i>Only two to go, Windu.</i>

24:18.991 --> 24:20.412
<i>Come and find us.</i>

24:20.662 --> 24:23.627
<i>We'll be waiting.</i>

24:23.669 --> 24:25.131
I'll go.

24:25.172 --> 24:27.468
I thought you had bigger concerns.

24:27.511 --> 24:30.809
That was before we knew
hostages were involved.

24:30.850 --> 24:33.150
You are too injured to travel,

24:33.463 --> 24:36.177
and your presence would only
aggravate the boy.

24:36.530 --> 24:39.996
I shall go and take
Padawan Tano with me.

24:55.071 --> 24:58.204
Next time I tell you to pull
the trigger, you do it!

25:05.595 --> 25:09.250
It should only be a matter of time
until they track us down.

25:11.317 --> 25:14.908
Something on your mind, Castas?

25:14.950 --> 25:17.623
Yeah, I got something to say.

25:17.706 --> 25:19.709
We're in over our heads.

25:19.751 --> 25:22.800
You signed on to kill Jedi.
Well, this is how it's done.

25:22.884 --> 25:26.349
You said the Separatists would
pay well if we killed Windu.

25:26.392 --> 25:29.273
That kid destroyed an entire cruiser,

25:29.314 --> 25:31.320
and now we're taking hostages.

25:31.361 --> 25:33.867
That was not part of the plan.

25:33.909 --> 25:36.518
I never took you for a coward, Castas.

25:36.622 --> 25:38.084
And what about you, Bossk?

25:38.125 --> 25:39.358
You feel the same?

25:39.463 --> 25:41.342
I'm still in.

25:41.384 --> 25:46.311
I got a lot riding on this kill,
and I need the cash.

25:46.353 --> 25:47.355
Not me.

25:47.440 --> 25:48.525
I'm out.

25:48.608 --> 25:50.529
Well, then you're in luck.

25:50.612 --> 25:52.450
I was planning on making a stop.

25:52.492 --> 25:55.832
You can drag your worthless carcass
off of this ship when we land.

25:55.875 --> 25:56.919
Where are we headed?

25:56.960 --> 25:59.173
We're going to visit an old friend.

25:59.214 --> 26:01.553
Maybe he can replace Castas.

26:01.637 --> 26:03.496
Set course for Florrum.

26:17.714 --> 26:20.283
Master Plo, I don't understand.

26:20.387 --> 26:23.936
Shouldn't we be heading for the last place
we knew Boba Fett was spotted?

26:23.979 --> 26:27.884
Why head to the one place
we know he is not?

26:44.274 --> 26:48.491
The second bounty hunter
in the hologram is Aurra Sing.

26:48.574 --> 26:50.622
Another bounty hunter.

26:50.664 --> 26:52.751
Like his father, Jango Fett.

26:53.836 --> 26:55.214
Yes.

26:55.298 --> 26:57.285
It seems this boy found himself

26:57.286 --> 27:01.355
in the care of at least one of
Jango's associates.

27:01.813 --> 27:03.984
So we're looking for
friends of Jango Fett

27:04.026 --> 27:05.697
or places where they hang out.

27:05.780 --> 27:10.292
And to do that,
we must go to the lower levels...

27:10.502 --> 27:12.171
the underworld.

27:30.432 --> 27:33.171
<i>Move along.
Move along.</i>

27:38.582 --> 27:41.487
<i>Move along.
Move along.</i>

27:42.050 --> 27:47.442
Your pass, please.
Your pass, please.

27:52.499 --> 27:54.403
Your pass, please.

27:56.009 --> 28:00.001
The data on Jango Fett suggested
he frequented this area.

28:00.356 --> 28:02.655
We must be cautious.

28:35.380 --> 28:36.758
Come on, punch him!

28:36.800 --> 28:38.327
Yeah, get him!

28:46.286 --> 28:48.043
Oh, my dear.

28:48.084 --> 28:52.746
You never were good at asking
for permission to land.

28:52.747 --> 28:56.442
I never ask for permission
to do anything, my darling.

28:58.533 --> 29:00.999
Yes.

29:02.587 --> 29:04.387
I remember.

29:06.305 --> 29:08.646
Not mine, I take it?

29:08.688 --> 29:11.990
No.
Part of my crew.

29:12.032 --> 29:13.913
He's Jango's son.

29:13.954 --> 29:15.021
Oh.

29:15.543 --> 29:16.796
Yes, yes.

29:16.838 --> 29:19.389
Sorry about your father.

29:19.429 --> 29:23.106
He was a friend and an honorable man.

29:26.661 --> 29:28.311
And that's Castas.

29:28.415 --> 29:29.880
But he's getting off here.

29:30.964 --> 29:33.097
Couldn't handle her, could you?

29:33.180 --> 29:35.478
Well, don't be ashamed.

29:35.519 --> 29:40.012
You're not the first man to bail out
from under her command.

29:40.118 --> 29:42.584
He's speaking from experience.

29:45.759 --> 29:47.849
Oh, you're a dangerous woman.

29:47.890 --> 29:50.482
Yes, very dangerous.

29:50.566 --> 29:51.819
Come, come, come.

29:51.861 --> 29:55.330
Let us go inside where we can
discuss business over a drink

29:55.413 --> 29:57.336
like civilized people.

30:19.069 --> 30:21.367
I'm stuck out here on Florrum.

30:21.410 --> 30:23.206
<i>I warned you.</i>

30:23.248 --> 30:26.383
<i>Working with Aurra Sing
is bad business.</i>

30:26.425 --> 30:32.108
Yeah, this job's gone south,
like every job I do with that hag.

30:39.799 --> 30:41.015
No, Boba.

30:44.144 --> 30:48.994
I hear there's a downed
Republic cruiser on Vanqor.

30:49.076 --> 30:50.748
Your handiwork?

30:50.831 --> 30:54.468
I wouldn't take credit for that,
no.

30:54.510 --> 30:58.145
We saw it, though,
crawling with Republic troops.

30:58.187 --> 31:01.155
I wouldn't try and salvage it
for a while if I were you.

31:01.197 --> 31:03.184
I appreciate the advice.

31:05.041 --> 31:08.762
So, Boba, what is it like
working with Aurra?

31:08.803 --> 31:09.974
It's all right.

31:10.809 --> 31:12.968
<i>I have some information.</i>

31:13.386 --> 31:17.142
<i>Information that's worth
something to the right people.</i>

31:17.328 --> 31:18.541
<i>Really?</i>

31:18.582 --> 31:20.129
<i>What kind of people?</i>

31:20.171 --> 31:21.926
That's where you come in.

31:21.968 --> 31:24.726
Remember, Aurra,
that job we pulled?

31:24.767 --> 31:26.189
Hmm?

31:26.273 --> 31:27.233
Oh, yes.

31:27.275 --> 31:29.908
Excuse me.

31:29.950 --> 31:30.995
Castas!

31:31.079 --> 31:32.165
Huh?

31:39.437 --> 31:40.566
Hey, hey.

31:40.649 --> 31:43.534
Someone scrape that guy off the floor.

31:43.576 --> 31:45.085
He sprung a leak.

31:59.832 --> 32:02.382
Well, I hope we have better luck here.

32:02.424 --> 32:06.477
This is the fifth scum bucket
drinking hole we've been to.

32:06.561 --> 32:07.732
Yes.

32:07.773 --> 32:11.661
And this time, try to be more subtle.

32:12.015 --> 32:13.917
What do you mean?

32:14.000 --> 32:17.553
You've adopted many of
your master's ways,

32:17.595 --> 32:21.128
including lack of subtlety.

32:22.777 --> 32:24.764
Sorry, Master Plo.

32:26.205 --> 32:28.337
Just try to blend in.

32:28.962 --> 32:30.299
Listen.

32:30.384 --> 32:32.307
You may be surprised
what people reveal

32:32.348 --> 32:34.815
when they have been drinking.

32:47.728 --> 32:49.652
Have a look around.

32:56.588 --> 33:00.057
I need some information.

33:00.097 --> 33:02.731
We're not selling that here, pal.

33:05.198 --> 33:08.040
Been a while since we had
one of you down here.

33:08.081 --> 33:12.116
Aren't you a bit busy with your war
to be bothering with the likes of us?

33:12.261 --> 33:16.566
We are never too busy
for the citizens of the Republic.

33:21.413 --> 33:23.505
I'm not getting anywhere.

33:24.591 --> 33:26.871
Okay, try to relax...

33:29.689 --> 33:31.567
...like Master Plo says.

33:32.530 --> 33:36.334
I'm listening...

33:36.376 --> 33:39.385
<i>This war is killing me.</i>

33:39.469 --> 33:42.227
<i>My whole business has gone under.</i>

33:42.310 --> 33:44.776
<i>Oh, get me another round.</i>

33:46.155 --> 33:49.874
<i>I saw her last night
on the video screen.</i>

33:51.254 --> 33:53.594
<i>I'm gonna ask her out.</i>

33:53.637 --> 33:56.667
<i>She'll never go out with you.</i>

33:56.750 --> 33:59.488
<i>She's gonna go out with me.</i>

33:59.530 --> 34:00.783
<i>Florrum?</i>

34:00.866 --> 34:03.584
<i>A buddy of mine
was just murdered on Florrum.</i>

34:03.625 --> 34:04.712
Murdered?

34:06.092 --> 34:08.764
Yeah, he was working a big job.

34:08.808 --> 34:11.357
At least that is what he said.

34:11.440 --> 34:14.366
He was telling me
he had some valuable information

34:14.409 --> 34:16.163
on a holotransmitter.

34:16.205 --> 34:17.626
And then... boom!

34:17.667 --> 34:19.130
She shot him.

34:19.172 --> 34:22.014
It must have been some good dirt.

34:22.098 --> 34:24.313
What's her name?

34:24.355 --> 34:26.652
Hope it's not who I think it is.

34:26.695 --> 34:28.909
He was working with Aurra Sing.

34:28.952 --> 34:30.998
She's bad news.

34:31.042 --> 34:33.842
Ah, that's her, all right.

34:33.882 --> 34:35.576
She's the boss' ex.

34:35.679 --> 34:38.355
There's always trouble
when she shows up.

34:38.396 --> 34:40.862
Yeah, that's the one.

34:41.908 --> 34:44.373
Find something interesting, kid?

34:45.668 --> 34:46.672
Hey, what's this?

34:46.715 --> 34:48.217
What are you reaching for?

34:52.608 --> 34:54.154
Stand down.

34:54.196 --> 34:56.870
You can't take us all, Jedi.

34:56.911 --> 35:02.721
Would you like to try
and prove your theory?

35:02.763 --> 35:05.815
Hey, nobody's shooting up
my place today.

35:06.441 --> 35:07.695
He's right.

35:08.697 --> 35:10.078
Drinks on the house.

35:15.384 --> 35:17.851
Not very subtle.

35:18.310 --> 35:21.193
Well, I was being subtle.

35:21.278 --> 35:23.199
Interesting result.

35:23.242 --> 35:25.749
But, Master, you were right.

35:25.791 --> 35:30.014
I heard about a murder -
a murder Aurra Sing recently committed.

35:30.119 --> 35:32.813
- Where?
- Florrum.

35:33.063 --> 35:35.780
Well done, little 'Soka.

35:35.863 --> 35:38.329
We're off to Florrum.

35:45.427 --> 35:50.644
Well, my dear, you are in an
interesting predicament once again.

35:51.876 --> 35:55.778
Getting involved with the Jedi
is never a good idea.

35:55.820 --> 35:56.948
<i>Aurra.</i>

35:56.989 --> 35:59.410
<i>We've got an incoming ship.</i>

35:59.493 --> 36:01.623
<i>Jedi, by the look of it.</i>

36:01.706 --> 36:02.540
Windu.

36:02.581 --> 36:05.128
Finally.
Took them long enough.

36:05.170 --> 36:08.592
Move Slave I to the outskirts
and get the hostages ready.

36:08.634 --> 36:10.283
<i>Right.</i>

36:10.430 --> 36:13.144
So are you in or not?

36:14.688 --> 36:18.820
I will not help you,
but I will not hinder you either.

36:19.321 --> 36:22.869
This is your fight, not mine.

36:58.014 --> 37:01.855
Hello, hello,
and welcome to Florrum.

37:02.001 --> 37:06.154
I should assume
you are walking us into a trap.

37:06.195 --> 37:07.656
Yes, you should.

37:07.698 --> 37:09.702
They're waiting inside the bar.

37:09.742 --> 37:13.542
I have no idea
what she has planned for you.

37:13.626 --> 37:16.089
And the reason
you are telling us is...?

37:16.925 --> 37:20.825
So you know
that I am not involved in this.

37:21.388 --> 37:24.728
Remember, patience.

37:38.711 --> 37:40.610
Bad move, Jedi.

37:40.715 --> 37:42.258
This will cost you.

37:42.886 --> 37:44.513
I wanted Windu.

37:44.555 --> 37:46.349
What are you doing here?

37:46.392 --> 37:50.128
We can do this the difficult way
or the simple way.

37:50.232 --> 37:52.235
The choice is yours.

37:52.528 --> 37:55.491
Bossk,
can you hear me?

37:55.532 --> 37:56.744
<i>Roger.</i>

37:56.786 --> 37:59.498
Execute the hostages
if I give the word.

37:59.538 --> 38:01.398
Unwise.

38:01.543 --> 38:04.674
You have already lost,
and you don't even know it.

38:04.716 --> 38:09.745
I am prepared to kill you,
the hostages, whatever it takes

38:09.850 --> 38:11.645
to get what Boba wants.

38:11.853 --> 38:14.150
Sounds more like
what you want.

38:17.885 --> 38:19.221
Don't!

38:22.540 --> 38:25.502
Aurra.
Aurra!

38:25.544 --> 38:27.507
Bad news, boys.

38:27.549 --> 38:31.118
If I don't hear from her soon,
I'm gone,

38:31.328 --> 38:33.622
and you're both fried.

38:35.395 --> 38:36.939
Let her go!

38:36.981 --> 38:38.965
No chance.

38:39.069 --> 38:42.031
She won't do it, Boba.
She's not like you.

38:42.178 --> 38:45.038
She's right.
I'm not a murderer.

38:45.247 --> 38:46.395
I'm not a murderer.

38:46.540 --> 38:48.378
But I want justice.

38:48.586 --> 38:51.131
We are justice.

38:51.173 --> 38:53.761
Don't listen to them.

38:53.803 --> 38:57.331
No one will be harmed
if you come quietly.

38:59.146 --> 39:01.108
I can't let you die.

39:01.150 --> 39:03.653
You won't have to.

39:10.165 --> 39:11.000
Aurra!

39:20.391 --> 39:21.310
It's over.

39:21.560 --> 39:22.854
Surrender!

39:23.481 --> 39:24.879
Aurra, now!

39:26.611 --> 39:27.675
Bomb!

39:31.287 --> 39:32.727
Boba, hurry.

39:35.168 --> 39:37.547
Aurra, help!
Help me!

39:42.098 --> 39:43.580
Don't leave me!

39:43.726 --> 39:46.020
No!

39:46.105 --> 39:48.859
The hostages, where are they?

39:48.901 --> 39:51.697
Boba, if you do not tell us
where those men are,

39:51.739 --> 39:54.536
they are going to die.
Innocent men!

39:54.578 --> 39:56.539
She left me.

40:20.623 --> 40:23.484
He will not reveal
the location of the hostages.

40:23.629 --> 40:26.218
I thought you might
talk some sense into him.

40:27.866 --> 40:31.310
Tell the Jedi
what he wants to know, Boba.

40:32.394 --> 40:35.171
Why should I help anybody?!
I've got no one.

40:36.317 --> 40:38.990
It is the honorable thing to do.

40:39.866 --> 40:42.643
It's what your father
would have wanted.

41:05.411 --> 41:09.441
<i>Ahsoka, she is trying to
lead you away from the hostages.</i>

41:09.586 --> 41:12.382
<i>Go to coordinates 1579.</i>

41:22.838 --> 41:24.530
Time's up.

41:31.709 --> 41:33.045
Don't move.

42:15.620 --> 42:17.164
No!
Come on!

42:40.373 --> 42:42.376
I see now
I've done terrible things.

42:43.003 --> 42:45.590
But you started it
when you murdered my father!

42:45.839 --> 42:47.719
I'll never forgive you.

42:50.557 --> 42:53.332
Well, you're going to have to.

42:53.583 --> 42:54.939
Take him away.

42:55.305 --> 43:01.171
