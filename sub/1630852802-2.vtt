WEBVTT

00:00.199 --> 00:01.300
[screams]

00:01.302 --> 00:04.370
Don't hit her nose.
It cost too much.

00:04.372 --> 00:06.772
<i>[Darcey] It's been a couple
weeks since our surgery.</i>

00:06.774 --> 00:08.674
<i>- Finally get to enjoy our new bodies.
- Oh!</i>

00:08.676 --> 00:10.709
Have you blown your nose?

00:10.711 --> 00:14.113
A little bit, but the doctor
taught me how to do it. [sniffs]

00:15.982 --> 00:18.083
- Fight, bitch.
- [grunts]

00:18.151 --> 00:19.318
[both cheer]

00:20.153 --> 00:21.387
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:21.654 --> 00:23.055
Yeah.

00:23.523 --> 00:25.190
I agreed to meet
with Georgi today.

00:38.705 --> 00:40.939
<i>[Stacey] I'm just so inspired
right now.</i>

00:40.941 --> 00:44.943
It's time for me to put effort
into what I love,

00:44.945 --> 00:46.745
<i>and Miami Swim Week is
the perfect place</i>

00:46.747 --> 00:50.015
<i>to build House of Eleven
into a global brand.</i>

00:51.918 --> 00:53.619
<i>I went to go see Georgi
in New York,</i>

00:53.621 --> 00:54.420
[yawns]

00:55.288 --> 00:58.791
And got a little hot and heavy.

00:58.793 --> 01:03.195
This is so just so goddamn crazy that I
don't even know what [bleep] to say anymore.

01:03.197 --> 01:05.064
I can't... This is too much.

01:05.066 --> 01:06.765
I, I can't.

01:06.767 --> 01:08.133
You've gotta figure
this [bleep] out.

01:08.735 --> 01:10.235
It's, it's just a mess.

01:11.704 --> 01:13.205
Figure it out, bitch.

01:30.657 --> 01:33.125
[Darcey] Oh, wow. Look at
that cute dress.

01:33.127 --> 01:34.726
<i>- [Aniko] Oh, yeah.
- [Darcey] Yeah.</i>

01:34.728 --> 01:38.897
Shop till we drop, girls.

01:38.899 --> 01:42.634
Today, I'm taking Aniko and
Aspen out on a little shopping spree.

01:42.702 --> 01:43.769
Ooh.

01:43.836 --> 01:46.405
- [Aniko] It's so cute in here.
- [Darcey] That's cute.

01:46.407 --> 01:49.775
Aniko's Miss Teen Connecticut
pageant is in a few days,

01:49.777 --> 01:51.276
so we need
to get her pageant ready.

01:51.278 --> 01:54.113
- [Aniko] Oh, what?
- [Aspen] Ooh.

01:54.115 --> 01:57.249
- Wow, look at these dresses.
- [Aniko] Didn't know they had this.

01:57.251 --> 01:59.785
I definitely think Aniko's
gonna win the whole pageant.

01:59.787 --> 02:03.422
<i>She's got a winning smile,
winning personality, a winning heart.</i>

02:03.424 --> 02:05.824
I'm her mom, you know?
It's in the blood.

02:05.826 --> 02:08.727
- I'm gonna be the best pageant mom in the world.
- Uh-huh.

02:08.729 --> 02:12.798
[Darcey chanting] Aniko!
Yeah! Winner!

02:12.800 --> 02:15.134
- Winners!
- If you scream, you're gonna get kicked out by security.

02:15.136 --> 02:16.869
I can't be proud and loud?

02:16.871 --> 02:19.071
Do you want people
to look at you or look at me?

02:19.073 --> 02:20.939
- You.
- Exactly, so don't scream.

02:20.941 --> 02:21.607
Okay, deal.

02:21.609 --> 02:24.343
- Deal.
- All right.

02:24.345 --> 02:27.613
I am a little bit nervous that my
mom will be a bit extra at the pageant.

02:27.615 --> 02:30.916
She's definitely gonna take,
like, videos, screaming your name.

02:30.918 --> 02:32.684
Oh, my God she's gonna be,
like, in the middle of the aisle

02:32.686 --> 02:35.621
with her phone on,
being like, "That's my baby!"

02:35.623 --> 02:37.689
- [imitating Darcey] "That's my daughter."
- Yeah.

02:37.691 --> 02:40.492
She's obviously gonna be very extra, 'cause
that's just the kind of person she is.

02:40.494 --> 02:42.194
It's like she's, like,
a fangirl.

02:43.830 --> 02:44.963
Do I have to wear a pageant
dress to the pageant?

02:44.965 --> 02:47.933
Not, like, a pageant dress,
but, like, a mom dress.

02:47.935 --> 02:49.735
- What's a mom dress?
- Something like that.

02:49.737 --> 02:52.571
Ugh, I don't think I'm that big.

02:52.573 --> 02:54.873
[laughs] I just got it
all sucked out.

02:54.875 --> 02:56.642
My whole life,
I've been a pageant mom.

02:56.644 --> 02:58.610
I mean, not for a pageant,
but, you know,

02:58.612 --> 03:00.846
cheered them on
for their sports,

03:00.848 --> 03:04.316
and their, you know, their dance
classes, and when they sing,

03:04.318 --> 03:08.387
and when they do their
social media dances and stuff.

03:08.389 --> 03:14.426
But now, I am so excited, 'cause I'm
officially, finally gonna be a pageant mom.

03:14.428 --> 03:16.895
- Yeah, let's go see Grandpa.
- [Aspen] Now we have ideas.

03:16.897 --> 03:17.729
- You guys hungry?
- I'm so hungry.

03:17.731 --> 03:18.764
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

03:18.766 --> 03:21.333
- Well, shopping works up an appetite.
- Yeah.

03:22.368 --> 03:24.870
<i>[Darcey] I love shopping
with my daughters,</i>

03:24.872 --> 03:30.242
but I just can't stop thinking about
what happened with Debbie and Reina.

03:31.578 --> 03:33.579
<i>Things are still tense
with them,</i>

03:33.581 --> 03:38.584
and I'm full of worry and,
you know, a little anxious,

03:38.586 --> 03:41.520
because I don't know how my dad
and my daughters are gonna react today

03:41.522 --> 03:46.091
<i>when I tell them that Georgi
and I are trying to work things out.</i>

03:46.093 --> 03:51.296
I just want them to feel, rest assured,
that I'm not gonna let anybody hurt me,

03:52.765 --> 03:54.099
like I did in the past.

03:54.867 --> 03:57.402
Worked up an appetite?
It keeps you healthy.

03:57.404 --> 03:59.871
- Oh, look who's here.
- Oh, hey, Dad.

03:59.873 --> 04:01.640
- How you doing?
- [girls laugh]

04:01.642 --> 04:03.742
[hisses]

04:03.744 --> 04:05.777
- [Aniko] What does that mean?
- [Grandpa] What's going on?

04:05.779 --> 04:06.912
- We're good.
- What was this?

04:06.914 --> 04:08.480
[Darcey] Thanks for coming.

04:08.482 --> 04:09.915
So, what are you doing?

04:09.917 --> 04:13.018
We went shopping and we saw
some pageant dresses.

04:13.020 --> 04:15.520
Gearing up to be
that pageant mom.

04:15.522 --> 04:16.922
Are you gonna teach me
that walk?

04:16.924 --> 04:19.825
- But it's rainy and cold out here.
- I'll do it.

04:19.827 --> 04:21.193
Tell me if I'm doing it right.

04:24.764 --> 04:27.065
[makes buzzer noise]

04:27.067 --> 04:28.567
Uh, I don't think so.

04:28.569 --> 04:30.168
Why is she so stiff?

04:30.737 --> 04:33.538
- You gotta sway more.
- [Darcey] Sway?

04:33.540 --> 04:34.573
- [Aniko] No.
- [Grandpa] No, no, no, no.

04:34.575 --> 04:37.309
- You're not crossing them.
- Absolutely not.

04:38.778 --> 04:41.980
I would rate my mom's walk
maybe, like, a solid six and a half.

04:41.982 --> 04:43.415
- I was gonna say a two.
- Seven.

04:44.617 --> 04:46.385
- Oh.
- [laughs]

04:48.021 --> 04:49.621
- Here are those desserts.
- Oh, wow. Oh, wow.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.523
- [Aniko] Oh, wow.
- Ooh.

04:51.525 --> 04:53.825
- [Aspen] Thank you.
- [Darcey] That's beautiful.

04:53.827 --> 04:57.396
This is nice, guys.
Aw, I miss good old days.

04:57.398 --> 05:01.066
Beautiful young ladies
you're growing into.

05:01.068 --> 05:05.804
You'll be in college, then you'll
have boyfriends and get married.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.172
What?

05:07.174 --> 05:09.875
Grandpa will not allow me
to have a boyfriend.

05:09.877 --> 05:12.477
When you're ready. Trust me,
relationships aren't easy.

05:12.479 --> 05:13.845
[Aniko] I know.

05:13.847 --> 05:16.281
Actually, uh, I've been
meaning to tell you...

05:17.750 --> 05:19.318
Georgi and I are talking again.

05:21.988 --> 05:24.122
We're just gonna see if we can
work things out.

05:24.657 --> 05:25.724
We're gonna take our time.

05:26.859 --> 05:29.361
We're not engaged, we're just
feeling things out.

05:31.764 --> 05:33.498
-So, I wanna come back to
the house, -[Aniko] Uh-huh.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.867
With you guys,
for a little while,

05:35.869 --> 05:38.170
so Georgi and I can
work through some problems.

05:39.405 --> 05:42.808
I don't know where I stand
on if it's a good idea

05:42.810 --> 05:45.010
for them to get back together
or not.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.578
I wanna get to know
him better, you know?

05:46.580 --> 05:48.146
[groans] Yeah.

05:48.148 --> 05:50.082
<i>[Aniko] I'm still gonna
support her as a daughter,</i>

05:50.084 --> 05:52.250
'cause we only want
our mom to be happy.

05:52.252 --> 05:53.318
Yeah.

05:55.688 --> 05:56.855
But, it's like a roller coaster.

05:56.857 --> 06:00.959
It's a roller coaster,
but he's made some progress.

06:01.661 --> 06:04.029
If it works out, it works out.

06:04.031 --> 06:07.733
-And if it doesn't, it's okay. Life goes on.
-[Aspen] Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

06:07.735 --> 06:09.201
We're gonna do some counseling.

06:10.036 --> 06:11.370
Together, separate?

06:11.372 --> 06:12.771
We're gonna do it together.

06:12.773 --> 06:15.841
-I want no drama. I don't
want-- -I'm not bringing drama.

06:15.843 --> 06:17.476
You're gonna be
fighting and arguing,

06:17.478 --> 06:19.644
but I don't wanna be
in the middle of any [bleep].

06:19.646 --> 06:21.747
You're not gonna be in the
middle of it, because I'm not gonna--

06:21.749 --> 06:22.547
I'm in the middle
of the [bleep] all the time.

06:22.549 --> 06:24.383
I'll just kinda figure it out.

06:25.918 --> 06:29.087
<i>[Grandpa] After everything Darcey's
been through in this relationship,</i>

06:29.089 --> 06:30.822
uh, in some ways
I am a little worried

06:30.824 --> 06:34.059
that Georgi may be
back into Darcey's life.

06:34.061 --> 06:37.028
<i>But I can't tell my daughter
who to be with.</i>

06:37.030 --> 06:39.464
Darcey needs to figure it out.

06:39.466 --> 06:43.802
Going to couples counseling,
I think it's a fantastic idea,

06:43.804 --> 06:46.204
and hopefully, that will
take them to a better place.

06:46.206 --> 06:48.206
We'll see where it goes.

06:48.808 --> 06:49.941
Okay, got it.

06:49.943 --> 06:52.944
- All right.
- I hear you.

07:02.822 --> 07:04.356
-[Stacey sighs] Beautiful day.
-Mmm-hmm.

07:05.057 --> 07:07.793
Yeah. You hungry?

07:07.795 --> 07:09.161
Want bacon, egg, and cheesy?

07:10.096 --> 07:11.897
Some coffee?

07:11.899 --> 07:13.165
[in New York accent] Coffee?

07:14.167 --> 07:15.367
What you want?

07:17.837 --> 07:19.037
Oh. [both giggle]

07:19.039 --> 07:20.572
I know what you want.

07:20.574 --> 07:22.040
Later.

07:23.142 --> 07:25.076
I know you're always
hungry for me, baby.

07:26.045 --> 07:26.978
Yeah, I know.

07:26.980 --> 07:29.381
I'm the meal and the dessert,
right, baby?

07:30.416 --> 07:32.384
That's right. Mmm,
what kind of dessert?

07:34.020 --> 07:35.353
Whipped cream with cherries?

07:37.323 --> 07:39.024
[slurps]

07:39.792 --> 07:43.962
So, Darcey wants us to pick up a couple
things at her apartment for her, today.

07:44.697 --> 07:48.767
[sighs] Well, she's gonna
be staying at my dad's house.

07:48.769 --> 07:51.403
Georgi, he's staying
in her apartment.

07:51.405 --> 07:53.405
You know, she kind of wants
to work on her relationship

07:53.407 --> 07:57.742
and figure out
what's next with Georgi.

07:57.744 --> 08:00.378
She seems to think he's changed,
but... [chuckles sarcastically]

08:09.555 --> 08:11.122
Same old, same old.

08:11.757 --> 08:13.792
<i>It's hard to watch
because we love her,</i>

08:13.794 --> 08:17.028
and we don't wanna see her
go down the wrong path again.

08:17.430 --> 08:20.131
I know she's strong,
but... [sighs]

08:20.666 --> 08:22.167
I don't want her to get hurt.

08:23.803 --> 08:26.238
<i>Since Georgi's been
back in Darcey's life,</i>

08:26.240 --> 08:31.042
I'm worried that that strength that
Darcey had in Turkey is gonna go away.

08:33.412 --> 08:39.117
I hate to see her have to continually
go through toxic relationships.

08:40.887 --> 08:42.187
No.

08:42.755 --> 08:45.023
It just makes me so upset.

08:46.425 --> 08:49.160
But, I feel like I have to
be the one to speak up.

08:50.530 --> 08:53.598
I feel like I have to
protect my sister.

08:53.600 --> 08:56.835
<i>She did that for me when I was
having problems with Florian,</i>

08:56.837 --> 09:01.473
finding photos of him
with another girl online.

09:01.475 --> 09:03.775
<i>So now, I just wanna
be there for Darcey,</i>

09:03.777 --> 09:05.877
<i>and I'm gonna
speak my truth to Georgi,</i>

09:05.879 --> 09:07.412
and tell him what's on my mind.

09:16.222 --> 09:17.355
Mmm-hmm.

09:21.127 --> 09:22.260
Yeah.

09:29.902 --> 09:31.336
Yeah. Like, how soft?

09:33.806 --> 09:35.607
- Like a little kitty cat?
- Yeah.

09:35.609 --> 09:38.043
Okay, but I don't know.

09:38.045 --> 09:40.278
I think it's more,
like, mama bear.

09:41.047 --> 09:42.314
Yeah.

09:43.416 --> 09:44.416
- Ready?
- Yeah.

09:50.756 --> 09:51.957
- [sighs] Hey.
- [Georgi] Hey.

09:51.959 --> 09:53.391
We're here
to pick up Darcey's stuff.

09:53.393 --> 09:55.160
- Can we come in?
- Okay.

09:59.031 --> 10:00.231
[Stacey] Okay, Flo.

10:02.201 --> 10:03.401
Give me the list.

10:04.203 --> 10:05.337
[Florian]

10:06.205 --> 10:07.973
Get these.

10:07.975 --> 10:10.008
Just, make sure you get
everything on the list.

10:10.010 --> 10:11.376
- It's what she asked for.
- Yep.

10:18.184 --> 10:19.985
[Stacey] I mean, I don't get it.

10:20.853 --> 10:23.188
What are your intentions
with Darcey?

10:30.763 --> 10:32.397
I feel like you're just gonna
go back to your old ways.

10:32.399 --> 10:34.299
You're gonna start fighting
and then break up,

10:34.867 --> 10:37.802
you know, days, weeks later.

10:37.804 --> 10:39.304
-Well, -It's, it's like
an endless cycle.

10:56.922 --> 10:58.456
And try to work on the things,

10:58.458 --> 10:59.791
and then, if it doesn't work--

10:59.793 --> 11:01.493
You had the opportunity
to do therapy before,

11:01.495 --> 11:03.194
but it's like... [sighs]

11:03.896 --> 11:06.297
Now you're okay with
counseling, I mean, I don't--

11:09.435 --> 11:11.936
I mean, you guys are
so up and down.

11:11.938 --> 11:14.372
I don't really know how Darcey
deals with this. I really don't.

11:15.908 --> 11:17.475
No, it's not.

11:19.912 --> 11:22.614
You don't see what she's... See,
[clapping] this is the problem with you.

11:22.616 --> 11:24.749
You don't ever acknowledge
what she's going through.

11:24.751 --> 11:26.818
It's always
what you're going through.

11:26.820 --> 11:28.353
You're living here, rent free.

11:36.295 --> 11:37.829
[Georgi]

11:49.075 --> 11:52.210
You had a whole month, when we
were in Turkey, to figure your [bleep] out.

11:53.813 --> 11:55.113
No, you didn't.

11:59.251 --> 12:00.785
You still don't have a job.

12:02.822 --> 12:06.691
Oh, I think you're just making up
more excuses, just to reel her back in.

12:06.693 --> 12:09.994
You could've did some
massages. Why didn't you do that?

12:14.967 --> 12:18.103
You did massages
while we were in Turkey?

12:22.541 --> 12:24.442
<i>[Stacey] Like, what the hell?</i>

12:24.444 --> 12:26.711
I could totally tell that Georgi's
lying right in front of my face.

12:26.713 --> 12:29.681
<i>He looks guilty.
He's not doing massages.</i>

12:29.683 --> 12:32.083
<i>[Stacey] And if he was,
Darcey would have told me.</i>

12:32.085 --> 12:37.322
He's just lying and manipulating
to make himself look good.

12:38.657 --> 12:41.025
That's [bleep] up.

12:42.728 --> 12:45.930
No, I'm not gonna [bleep]
chill. You're [bleep] lying.

12:45.932 --> 12:47.098
I'm done with this conversation.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.933
I'm [bleep] done.

12:58.477 --> 13:00.111
[door closes]

13:02.648 --> 13:05.383
- Miss Teen Connecticut in the house.
- Whoo!

13:05.385 --> 13:06.985
Let's do this.
Show us that walk.

13:06.987 --> 13:08.753
[all] Wow!

13:08.755 --> 13:10.321
Where did you learn
how to do that?

13:10.323 --> 13:11.656
It's how I always walk.

13:11.658 --> 13:14.726
If my mom gets thrown out of
the pageant for being over the top,

13:14.728 --> 13:16.694
I honestly,
wouldn't even be surprised.

13:16.696 --> 13:19.998
- Aniko! Aniko!
- Mom, no, no, no.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.935
- Bring it down a notch, Darce.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

13:23.937 --> 13:26.304
What brings you
to couple's therapy?

13:32.845 --> 13:35.079
The things that you've done,

13:35.081 --> 13:37.115
well, you can't make excuses
for that.

13:44.790 --> 13:48.126
- This is so exciting.
- I know. I can't wait.

13:49.261 --> 13:52.463
- Miss Teen Connecticut in the house.
- Whoo!

13:52.465 --> 13:54.532
Aniko!

13:54.534 --> 13:56.668
<i>[Darcey] Aniko is competing
in Miss Connecticut Teen</i>

13:56.670 --> 14:00.572
and today is the first day
of the pageant experience.

14:00.574 --> 14:05.743
<i>She's doing headshots, she has
an orientation. So it's a big deal.</i>

14:05.745 --> 14:09.447
But you know what? She's got the
winning mindset and I'm proud of her.

14:10.416 --> 14:12.417
One second, Darce.
Got something for you.

14:12.419 --> 14:14.052
Oh, what's, oh, okay.

14:14.054 --> 14:16.187
What's that?

14:16.189 --> 14:17.388
Uh, just an old suitcase.

14:17.957 --> 14:19.357
[sighs]

14:20.259 --> 14:21.759
Let's do this.
Show us that walk.

14:21.761 --> 14:23.061
[all] Wow.

14:23.063 --> 14:24.729
Where did you learn
how to do that?

14:24.731 --> 14:26.698
It's how I always walk.

14:26.700 --> 14:29.567
I'm super nervous but
super excited about today

14:29.569 --> 14:33.705
'cause it's literally the...
real start of my journey.

14:33.707 --> 14:36.407
Or should I say the beginning
to the end of my journey.

14:36.409 --> 14:38.443
- Beauty queens in the house.
- You got this.

14:38.445 --> 14:41.579
I've been working super hard in
order to prepare for this pageant.

14:41.581 --> 14:45.717
<i>I think I'm ready to do it
but I do have insecurities.</i>

14:45.719 --> 14:48.953
<i>This is my first pageant
so I can't lose my confidence.</i>

14:48.955 --> 14:51.623
I have to bring it all.

14:51.625 --> 14:54.759
- Aniko! Aniko!
- Mom, no, no, no, no.

14:54.761 --> 14:57.495
Put the volume down.
We're in a public setting.

14:57.497 --> 15:01.232
- Take it down a notch?
- Take it down a lot of notches.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.801
You're Miss Teen Connecticut.
You got to start manifesting it.

15:03.803 --> 15:05.470
- Don't say that.
- Why? You are, though.

15:05.472 --> 15:08.506
- You got to visualize it.
- Stop.

15:08.508 --> 15:13.778
The most embarrassing quality that my
mum has is that she is very outspoken.

15:13.780 --> 15:17.682
Like, a freaking animal just
escaped the zoo or something,

15:17.684 --> 15:19.417
like, that's how loud
she's being.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.953
- You're so loud.
- My voice doesn't linger.

15:21.955 --> 15:23.655
- Oh, thank you.
- We're in a freaking echoey room.

15:23.657 --> 15:25.790
Of course I'm gonna hear you.

15:25.792 --> 15:28.993
- Bring it down a notch, Darce.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

15:28.995 --> 15:32.630
If my mom gets thrown out of
the pageant for being over the top,

15:32.632 --> 15:34.666
I honestly wouldn't even
be surprised.

15:34.668 --> 15:37.969
She would do anything to like...

15:37.971 --> 15:39.671
Try to like, get their
attention or something.

15:39.673 --> 15:42.206
But yeah, it does get
pretty annoying.

15:43.008 --> 15:46.744
- So you excited, Aniko?
- I am. I'm a little nervous.

15:46.746 --> 15:49.147
But you know,
I'll get through it.

15:49.149 --> 15:52.317
Like, grandpa always taught us
"Keep your eye on the prize."

15:52.319 --> 15:53.851
Yeah.

15:53.853 --> 15:56.721
Guess what? Stacey and mommy
have some good news for you guys.

15:56.723 --> 15:59.857
- What?
- We registered for Miami Swim Week...

15:59.859 --> 16:03.127
- That's exciting.
- And we're going to Miami.

16:03.129 --> 16:05.596
- Really?
- And we'd love for you guys to go.

16:05.598 --> 16:06.864
Girls' trip.

16:06.866 --> 16:08.733
I'm so excited to be going
to Miami.

16:08.735 --> 16:10.868
- I don't know about you but...
- I'm so excited.

16:10.870 --> 16:13.805
I need to relieve all the
stress that has been building up

16:13.807 --> 16:15.873
- over the last year.
- Go to the beach.

16:15.875 --> 16:19.043
Get tan, all the shops
are super cute there.

16:19.045 --> 16:20.812
The restaurants are really nice.

16:20.814 --> 16:24.315
The boys there are really
good looking.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.855
- There she is.
- [all] Hello.

16:30.857 --> 16:32.557
-How's it going
-How are you?

16:32.559 --> 16:35.226
- Good.
- Ready?

16:35.228 --> 16:39.130
- I've been tested so I'm going to take this off...
- Okay.

16:39.132 --> 16:40.965
- It's great to have you here.
- Brittany.

16:40.967 --> 16:42.600
Nice to meet you, I'm Darcey.

16:42.602 --> 16:44.602
Stacey. Nice to meet you.

16:44.604 --> 16:45.803
- We're besties already so.
- Yes.

16:45.805 --> 16:47.739
Great, thank you
for coaching her.

16:47.741 --> 16:51.809
Absolutely.
So today is orientation day,

16:51.811 --> 16:53.845
which is a pretty big day
because you're going to meet

16:53.847 --> 16:56.481
all of the girls
you're competing against.

16:56.483 --> 16:58.750
And the big goal for today
is for you to be memorable.

16:58.752 --> 17:01.686
I want you to go to each and
every one of them, introduce yourself

17:01.688 --> 17:04.122
because they should know
your name by the end of the day.

17:04.124 --> 17:08.192
- Because you came here to win.
- To win.

17:08.194 --> 17:10.695
Part of this pageant process
is definitely mental toughness.

17:10.697 --> 17:13.798
You have to walk in being
your most confident self.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.534
So I just can't wait to show
everyone what I got.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.403
Are you ready for orientation?

17:18.405 --> 17:20.538
- I'm ready.
- All right. I'm sorry mom, not allowed for this,

17:20.540 --> 17:22.874
- she is all mine.
- Oh, yeah.

17:22.876 --> 17:25.510
- [laughing] - Here we go.
What I got, the doghouse?

17:25.512 --> 17:27.045
- Ready?
- Can I come?

17:27.047 --> 17:29.647
- Absolutely, Aspen.
- Sorry guys, I'm leaving you all.

17:29.649 --> 17:30.782
It's okay.

17:30.784 --> 17:32.784
- Bye.
- Thank you for being there for her.

17:32.786 --> 17:34.118
- Love you too.
- Have fun.

17:34.120 --> 17:37.288
Believe it or not, we didn't have
the confidence at Aniko's age.

17:37.290 --> 17:41.426
We were 16. We definitely
weren't as glam. That's for sure.

17:41.428 --> 17:45.063
- And poised like Aniko is.
- We would never think about putting makeup on.

17:45.065 --> 17:46.397
Just because
we were embarrassed.

17:46.399 --> 17:49.567
No, we tried. We would secretly
like, play with makeup and stuff.

17:49.569 --> 17:51.803
- Do a little impromptu photoshoots.
- Little photoshoots.

17:51.805 --> 17:56.040
So, we never showed anybody
those pictures but ourselves.

17:56.042 --> 17:59.510
- It's just, we did it in kind of privacy.
- Privacy.

17:59.512 --> 18:01.279
- Yeah.
- But she's got it.

18:01.281 --> 18:04.215
And I believe in her
and she's going to win.

18:05.017 --> 18:05.983
All right. Give me a big hug.

18:05.985 --> 18:07.752
Go knock them down in there.

18:07.754 --> 18:10.755
- Yeah. I'll see you soon.
- You got this.

18:10.757 --> 18:13.424
- Whoo!
- I am so proud of you.

18:18.964 --> 18:19.964
Nice to meet you.

18:19.966 --> 18:22.533
- I'm Ani.
- Hi.

18:22.535 --> 18:24.902
Hi, I'm Ani. Nice to meet you.

18:24.904 --> 18:27.939
Seeing my competition today
is a bit intimidating

18:27.941 --> 18:30.675
because I'm one of the
youngest in the pageant.

18:30.677 --> 18:32.009
Have you done
this pageant before?

18:32.011 --> 18:33.044
No, first time ever doing
a pageant.

18:33.046 --> 18:34.812
- Oh.
- Yeah.

18:34.814 --> 18:38.316
The teen division is like
14 to 19

18:38.318 --> 18:40.585
and a lot of these girls
are like 18, 19 years old.

18:40.587 --> 18:43.454
And these girls have been trying
to get the crown for like, four years.

18:43.456 --> 18:49.060
But like, I'm ready to just
step right in and just be myself.

18:54.399 --> 18:58.069
I'm excited to do a pageant but I'm also
nervous and getting pretty overwhelmed

18:58.071 --> 19:02.907
on how much work goes into it
because I have a lot to prepare for.

19:02.909 --> 19:04.208
More than I expected.

19:04.210 --> 19:06.978
Just look straight towards me.
You know, just relax your face,

19:06.980 --> 19:08.646
- You know, whatever feels natural to you.
- Okay.

19:08.648 --> 19:11.682
Cool. Beautiful. Love that.

19:11.684 --> 19:15.586
Big smile like that.
There you go. Beautiful.

19:15.588 --> 19:18.422
<i>These are like the first
professional headshots I ever had.</i>

19:18.424 --> 19:21.425
And that makes me feel
like a model, honestly.

19:21.427 --> 19:23.895
I feel so confident,
I feel so pretty.

19:23.897 --> 19:26.197
I'm getting hyped up by the
photographer, it's awesome.

19:27.099 --> 19:28.533
All right. We good.

19:28.535 --> 19:30.635
- Awesome. Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

19:30.637 --> 19:33.738
I honestly really feel like,
she's gonna do amazing.

19:33.740 --> 19:36.207
- I honestly think she's going to win.
- She's gonna do great.

19:36.209 --> 19:38.543
She's got that 'it' factor and
so does Aspen, I feel like,

19:38.545 --> 19:41.579
you know, this is something that
maybe, Aspen could do later on in life.

19:41.581 --> 19:45.383
- You know, they're beautiful and they're talented.
- They are.

19:45.385 --> 19:48.186
And they know exactly what
they want and I'm proud of them.

19:51.423 --> 19:56.127
It's Aniko's day and I didn't
really wanna create any drama.

19:56.129 --> 20:00.464
But I have to say, when I was
there in your apartment with Georgi,

20:00.466 --> 20:02.600
it was the most awkward feeling.

20:02.602 --> 20:07.905
I felt so belittled and like, it
was ticking me off. I got heated.

20:07.907 --> 20:10.007
He said some things
that were concerning.

20:10.009 --> 20:12.410
Uh, he said that he still...

20:14.746 --> 20:17.048
is doing massages in Virginia.

20:17.549 --> 20:18.749
What are you talking about?

20:18.751 --> 20:20.718
- He's doing massages?
- That's what he said.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.954
- No, he's not.
- That's what he said.

20:23.288 --> 20:26.324
It's very strange that Georgi
would say that.

20:26.326 --> 20:30.261
<i>[Darcey] As far as I know, Georgi has not
been working since he moved to Connecticut.</i>

20:30.263 --> 20:34.799
<i>He would have told me 'cause
Georgi would've been proud about that.</i>

20:34.801 --> 20:39.570
Listen, it's his life. He can get any
freaking cockamamie job he wants.

20:39.572 --> 20:42.640
Point is why does he got to
lie to you?

20:42.642 --> 20:45.977
This is very disappointing to me
because I thought we're gonna have a,

20:45.979 --> 20:47.745
a new beginning, a fresh start.

20:47.747 --> 20:50.581
And if this is Georgi's
definition of,

20:50.583 --> 20:53.584
you know,
making our relationship work,

20:53.586 --> 20:56.020
I mean, it's gonna be over
before it started.

20:57.589 --> 21:00.057
I don't know.
I don't know, Darcey.

21:02.361 --> 21:04.662
He said that when I was
in Turkey with my sister

21:04.664 --> 21:08.299
that he was in Virginia doing
massages which is a blatant lie.

21:12.938 --> 21:15.072
Do you give massages
in Virginia?

21:17.709 --> 21:21.979
[upbeat music playing]

21:21.981 --> 21:25.883
<i>♪ Just like two

21:25.885 --> 21:28.986
<i>♪ Where I'd rather be ♪</i>

21:28.988 --> 21:30.421
<i>♪ Right here where we are ♪</i>

21:32.891 --> 21:34.158
Hey.

21:34.860 --> 21:37.128
Good. Thank you for coming.

21:38.530 --> 21:40.331
Today, Georgi and I are going
to a therapist

21:40.333 --> 21:43.434
to see if our relationship
is salvageable.

21:43.436 --> 21:49.407
<i>This is his opportunity to really open
up and show me that he's changed</i>

21:49.409 --> 21:53.277
because I'm not going to put up with
the same things that I put up with before.

21:56.682 --> 21:58.182
Thank you.

22:15.033 --> 22:18.936
- Sit wherever you'd like.
- Here. It's good.

22:19.371 --> 22:21.572
Welcome. It's so great
for you to be here.

22:21.574 --> 22:26.977
I'm really interested in what
brings you to couple's therapy.

22:26.979 --> 22:32.416
Well, um, we've been really trying
to figure out some of our issues.

22:32.418 --> 22:33.784
You know we're engaged.
It's called off.

22:33.786 --> 22:36.887
We're not technically together
as a couple right now.

22:36.889 --> 22:39.590
It's hard because I do care
and I know he cares.

22:39.592 --> 22:43.060
It's just I need
more consistency from him.

22:43.062 --> 22:47.932
I feel like, you know, the way
we communicate is not great at all

22:47.934 --> 22:51.902
and I think he's afraid
to open up and be vulnerable.

22:51.904 --> 22:53.471
And really tell me
what he's truly feeling.

22:53.473 --> 22:56.974
So, it's like, it's just hard 'cause
I want to be able to trust him.

23:12.557 --> 23:15.993
So nothing that you do
to really bring it on?

23:16.762 --> 23:19.897
No, I let the past go. I'm
not trying to bring the past up.

23:19.899 --> 23:22.733
I'm trying to avoid past
patterns. I want to break patterns.

23:22.735 --> 23:24.702
I don't wanna be the same
Darcey I was in the past

23:24.704 --> 23:27.705
to allow those things
to happen again.

23:27.707 --> 23:32.076
The things that you've done, well
you can't make excuses for that.

23:32.844 --> 23:35.646
I've had trust issues
with my past relationships.

23:35.648 --> 23:41.585
But regardless, I have a hard time
trusting Georgi because he's closed off.

23:41.587 --> 23:44.822
Doesn't take
any accountability, he lies.

23:44.824 --> 23:48.225
<i>So I need him to come clean
and be vulnerable and more open.</i>

23:50.595 --> 23:54.965
I just want him to know that he can
be vulnerable with me and open up.

23:54.967 --> 23:57.101
Is that part of what you
wanna do here?

24:03.141 --> 24:05.743
But it's been tough.

24:05.745 --> 24:09.046
Like, the other day, my sister went to
go get some clothes for me for instance,

24:09.048 --> 24:11.081
since I was staying at my Dad's.

24:11.116 --> 24:14.151
And it didn't go so well.

24:15.987 --> 24:19.890
He said that when I was in Turkey with
her that he was in Virginia doing massages

24:19.892 --> 24:21.392
which is a blatant lie.

24:27.466 --> 24:29.233
Oh, being sarcastic.

24:32.537 --> 24:34.405
She didn't take it that way.
She got very upset.

24:39.411 --> 24:41.412
What did you, because she
was asking you questions.

24:41.414 --> 24:43.147
So that was rude?

24:43.415 --> 24:44.415
[sighs]

24:45.250 --> 24:47.284
So you do massages in Virginia?

24:48.153 --> 24:49.420
[sighs]

24:50.655 --> 24:52.122
No.

25:08.406 --> 25:11.609
So, since he's not working, I
pretty much paid for everything,

25:11.611 --> 25:15.079
which I was okay with but I
thought eventually he would...

25:15.081 --> 25:16.547
get on his feet, figure out
what he wants to do.

25:16.549 --> 25:18.983
Maybe he's transitioning to
another career or something like that.

25:18.985 --> 25:20.951
I just feel he doesn't tell me
his life plans.

25:20.953 --> 25:23.153
I don't want to be used.

25:23.155 --> 25:24.722
I'm not [bleep] sugar momma.

25:24.724 --> 25:27.992
Never gonna be and
he has a lot of debt.

25:56.254 --> 25:59.990
Who's like the better
listener, would you say?

26:06.298 --> 26:10.501
Couples do this and you're like
how can you not see it how I see it.

26:10.503 --> 26:13.871
I'm just trying to like, understand
him but he gets defensive

26:13.873 --> 26:16.774
and then he spins it on me and
then that's a trigger and then we both...

26:16.776 --> 26:18.542
- Yeah, a trigger tango.
- Yeah.

26:18.544 --> 26:21.412
- There you go trigger tango.
- Yeah

26:23.281 --> 26:26.951
<i>I would describe Darcey and
Georgi's communication style</i>

26:26.953 --> 26:31.255
as like a diamond there's like...
There's like ten different things happening

26:31.257 --> 26:33.390
and they're seeing one side.

26:33.392 --> 26:38.896
<i>Each person sees it from their perspective
and they keep escalating up, up, up,</i>

26:38.898 --> 26:44.702
they're just going up, instead of
calming and tuning to one and another,

26:44.704 --> 26:47.471
they're just raising
and escalating their volume.

26:47.473 --> 26:50.574
I think both of you need new
communication skills.

26:50.576 --> 26:56.880
What I usually do, okay, is I say, so,
you can repeat back what you heard.

26:56.882 --> 27:00.985
And then, it's like yeah... That
is what I meant, or if it wasn't.

27:19.170 --> 27:20.337
You don't feel heard?

27:21.940 --> 27:23.073
Okay

27:24.709 --> 27:26.143
Okay

27:27.245 --> 27:29.913
This wasn't easy to hear at all.

27:29.915 --> 27:33.117
<i>I've always tried to be
understanding and listen to him and...</i>

27:33.785 --> 27:34.851
[sigh]

27:35.053 --> 27:37.021
I probably didn't listen as
much as I should've.

27:41.993 --> 27:43.127
Alright.

27:43.395 --> 27:45.062
I am sorry.

27:46.798 --> 27:50.901
<i>I've been hurt in the past by
Georgi's behavior and demeanor and</i>

27:50.903 --> 27:55.005
it's hard to forget that but,
Georgi's really making an effort

27:55.007 --> 27:58.042
<i>It's really hard for Georgi to
open up and be vulnerable like this</i>

27:58.044 --> 28:00.577
<i>and that shows me Georgi
has changed for real.</i>

28:00.579 --> 28:03.180
It gives me hope.

28:03.182 --> 28:06.917
<i>But it is going to take working and
this is not going to be fixed overnight.</i>

28:06.919 --> 28:10.788
I just want you to know that, you
know when you're vulnerable like this,

28:10.790 --> 28:15.159
This is what makes me feel open and loving
you more, like makes me trust you more.

28:19.564 --> 28:21.532
You, Stacey and Florian, just
need to make amends.

28:21.534 --> 28:24.935
Because they're not happy
with you possibly coming.

28:24.937 --> 28:29.173
Just want to make sure that there's
no drama, cause she doesn't want that.

28:32.844 --> 28:35.345
[upbeat music playing]

28:40.585 --> 28:42.352
Ready to go swim?

28:44.556 --> 28:49.993
Today we're going to enjoy our
spa day, our quality time together

28:49.995 --> 28:54.765
and relax and just decompress.
You know there's been a lot going on.

28:54.767 --> 28:56.366
With, you know...

28:57.402 --> 28:59.403
The stress from Darcey and
Georgi's drama.

29:05.877 --> 29:09.113
In with the good, [exhales]
out with the bad.

29:09.115 --> 29:10.347
[both] Yeah.

29:11.983 --> 29:13.984
Close your eyes I've a
surprise for you.

29:20.792 --> 29:22.292
Okay, open.

29:25.396 --> 29:27.431
They're wings for Miami baby.

29:36.808 --> 29:39.676
Remember that time in Albania
when I taught you to swim?

29:39.678 --> 29:43.680
And you did good, you were doing the doggy
paddle and I was like keep your head up.

29:43.682 --> 29:47.718
I tried to teach him how to
hold his nose. Go under.

29:47.720 --> 29:50.053
He doesn't like to get his
hair wet, I think that's...

29:50.055 --> 29:51.989
I think that's were
it stems from.

29:53.825 --> 29:54.958
Have you seen these before?

29:56.961 --> 29:59.096
I don't think they're going
to fit on you I could try.

29:59.098 --> 30:00.764
Push

30:00.832 --> 30:03.133
Pretend it's a boxing glove.

30:07.972 --> 30:11.041
Did you ever wear the
floatie's when you were a kid?

30:17.048 --> 30:18.215
Pop up baby!

30:20.151 --> 30:22.386
Whoa!

30:23.021 --> 30:24.288
All-inclusive baby.

30:25.023 --> 30:26.190
Cheers.

30:26.925 --> 30:28.058
To Miami.

30:28.060 --> 30:29.293
You-- you excited?

30:29.761 --> 30:31.028
Me too.

30:31.030 --> 30:34.965
I'm so excited for you to meet
my cousin Shannon

30:34.967 --> 30:39.002
You know, she lives there and
yeah... actually I want to call her.

30:45.844 --> 30:46.443
[cell phone ringing]

30:48.146 --> 30:49.580
Hey Shannon!

30:49.614 --> 30:53.283
- Hi, hi!
- Hey!

30:53.285 --> 30:57.221
Shannon, Darcey and I are first cousins,
we grew up together in Connecticut.

30:57.223 --> 31:02.860
<i>We would have sleepovers and just
hang out with all our other cousins and</i>

31:02.862 --> 31:08.665
we were very close and we all got married, you
know had kids you know around the same time.

31:08.667 --> 31:13.103
She's done amazing things in her
life and just proud to call her a cousin

31:13.438 --> 31:16.206
- We have really good news.
<i>- [Shannon] What?</i>

31:16.208 --> 31:20.177
-We're coming to Miami
<i>-[Shannon] Yes! Are you serious?</i>

31:20.179 --> 31:21.511
Finally, yeah

31:21.513 --> 31:23.413
<i>[Shannon] First off, are you
really coming?</i>

31:23.415 --> 31:26.116
We're definitely coming this time,
cause Darcey and I decided that

31:26.118 --> 31:29.353
Ah, we wanted to do Miami
swim week, so we're really excited

31:29.355 --> 31:32.789
<i>[Shannon] Wow! that's a really big
deal. People come from all over the world.</i>

31:32.791 --> 31:34.157
<i>So this is all going to be
House of Eleven stuff?</i>

31:34.159 --> 31:36.560
House of Eleven Swim.

31:36.562 --> 31:39.830
<i>[Shannon] Wow! Are you gonna have
any time for family time? Who's coming?</i>

31:39.832 --> 31:45.402
Florian's gonna be there, Darce,
Aniko and Aspen So, it's so exciting.

31:45.404 --> 31:47.271
<i>- [Shannon] Yes!
- Yes. Yes.</i>

31:47.273 --> 31:49.206
Ah, I'll just give you
a little secret

31:49.807 --> 31:50.340
Um,

31:50.342 --> 31:52.943
Darcey and Georgi...

31:52.945 --> 31:56.346
They're not in a good place right
now. Darcey broke off the engagement.

31:57.148 --> 31:59.383
So, um... I don't know
if he's coming

32:01.119 --> 32:02.352
I mean you know...

32:02.354 --> 32:06.023
<i>- [Shannon] Well listen, whoever comes, comes.
- Yes.</i>

32:07.492 --> 32:09.960
<i>- [Shannon] Give everybody my love okay, see you guys soon.
- Yes.</i>

32:09.962 --> 32:12.930
<i>[Shannon] Love you guys, see
you later.</i>

32:12.932 --> 32:15.232
- Here we come Miami.
<i>- [Shannon] Yes!</i>

32:15.700 --> 32:17.267
I love her, aw.

32:17.669 --> 32:19.703
<i>Shannon, she has the dream life.</i>

32:19.705 --> 32:23.407
She's is an amazing mother,
wife and entrepreneur.

32:23.409 --> 32:25.909
<i>She's created a healthy
fast food restaurant</i>

32:25.911 --> 32:29.813
<i>and her husband's Ray Allen,
he was a huge NBA player.</i>

32:29.815 --> 32:32.749
They're like the ultimate
power couple.

32:32.751 --> 32:36.586
After our divorces, Darcey and
I, we promised each other that

32:36.588 --> 32:41.992
we wouldn't settle and that we
would find true love

32:41.994 --> 32:43.593
<i>I, a hundred percent found
that in Florian,</i>

32:43.595 --> 32:47.631
but I don't believe
Darcey's found that in Georgi.

32:47.633 --> 32:54.071
I know Darcey has a tendency to
compare her life to other people's life.

32:54.073 --> 32:56.273
<i>And it worries me that she's
going to put unnecessary</i>

32:56.275 --> 32:59.576
<i>pressure on herself when she
sees Shannon's perfect world.</i>

32:59.578 --> 33:04.881
I just want Darcey to take her
time and focus on what's best for her.

33:04.883 --> 33:07.150
- So you ready for Miami baby?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

33:07.152 --> 33:09.286
Yeah, it's gonna be hot

33:10.755 --> 33:14.324
[upbeat music playing]

33:17.061 --> 33:19.029
I'm proud of us going for
to counselling.

33:19.031 --> 33:20.230
Wasn't easy.

33:33.177 --> 33:34.378
I'm cold, yeah.

33:35.346 --> 33:37.681
Aww, oh

33:37.683 --> 33:41.752
Well that's a sweet gesture,
thank you. See.

33:41.754 --> 33:44.988
This is the attention that
I like. Wow.

33:45.757 --> 33:48.025
Nice and warm now, you
warmed my heart

33:48.526 --> 33:54.231
I think today, was the
start of... something good.

33:54.233 --> 33:59.036
I think I'm ready to put the work in
and, I hope you are too and willing to try.

34:01.572 --> 34:03.373
Mhm.

34:04.809 --> 34:09.613
So, anyway, I'm just letting you know I'm
going to Miami, my kids are gonna come

34:09.615 --> 34:12.115
I'll be there with Stacey,
we're playing the fashion show

34:14.185 --> 34:17.788
It would be nice if
you could come,

34:17.790 --> 34:22.059
but I just want to make sure that... there's
no drama, cause she doesn't want that.

34:22.061 --> 34:23.126
Florian doesn't want that.

34:24.562 --> 34:26.663
Okay

34:26.665 --> 34:29.332
<i>I know that it might be too quick
for Georgi to come into Miami.</i>

34:29.334 --> 34:31.968
Especially after what
with Stacey,

34:31.970 --> 34:37.808
<i>but at the same time, we're on a role
and I want to continue working on things.</i>

34:37.810 --> 34:44.047
And you know, in my heart I truly feel
that bringing Georgi to Miami... is right.

34:45.950 --> 34:48.919
There is going to be some
things that need to happen

34:48.921 --> 34:51.388
before Miami, that I need
you to do for me.

34:53.157 --> 34:55.725
You know, you Stacey and
Florian just need to make amends.

34:55.727 --> 34:59.129
You need to apologize for
lying, that wasn't really cool.

34:59.964 --> 35:01.298
Apologies go a long way.

35:09.807 --> 35:10.407
Thank you.

35:12.043 --> 35:13.243
Thank you.

35:14.979 --> 35:16.079
Yes.

35:18.583 --> 35:20.217
That's nice

35:21.853 --> 35:25.922
I... I don't know how Stacey's gonna
react to bringing Georgi to Miami.

35:25.924 --> 35:28.725
<i>But I just hope that
she accepts it.</i>

35:28.727 --> 35:31.995
Because I just personally feel
that I'm being pulled

35:31.997 --> 35:35.065
in all these different directions
and I don't wanna do this anymore.

35:37.869 --> 35:39.202
What you looking at
me like that for?

35:40.638 --> 35:42.239
Aww.

35:47.678 --> 35:51.882
I think it would be really beneficial
if Georgi comes on this trip.

35:51.884 --> 35:53.884
But I don't feel like he
deserves to come to Miami.

35:53.886 --> 35:55.986
But it's my company too.

35:58.089 --> 35:59.456
[instrumental music playing]

36:04.662 --> 36:08.465
You're so passionate about those
lamb chops, you place them so gentle

36:08.467 --> 36:12.836
You gotta keep the juicy,
gotta keep the juicy

36:12.838 --> 36:17.007
Tonight, Georgi's cooking
dinner for Stacey, Florian and me

36:17.009 --> 36:20.677
to just... know,
bury the hatchet.

36:20.679 --> 36:22.379
Like a peace offering
in a sense.

36:31.122 --> 36:33.557
Oh, look what they
got here already.

36:33.559 --> 36:39.029
Oh, borek, baklava, salad.

36:39.031 --> 36:43.133
<i>I really just want for us to all get
along and everyone to have a fresh start.</i>

36:43.135 --> 36:46.002
It's really important, since I
need to tell Stacey and Florian,

36:46.004 --> 36:50.040
that I want Georgi to come to Miami.
Definitely need this night to go well.

36:51.008 --> 36:51.942
Hey guys.

36:51.944 --> 36:52.943
Hey

36:52.945 --> 36:54.411
Hey, hey!

36:56.814 --> 36:58.715
Thanks for coming.

36:58.717 --> 36:59.749
You're hungry?

36:59.784 --> 37:02.419
Sure, what you got there?

37:08.125 --> 37:10.827
You know what happens when
Georgi make his lamb chops.

37:10.829 --> 37:11.928
Oh!

37:11.930 --> 37:13.196
Fights happen.

37:15.900 --> 37:17.033
Uh-oh

37:26.210 --> 37:28.345
I get it, he's trying
to smooth things over.

37:28.347 --> 37:32.816
<i>And I would love to believe that
everything is okay with Darcey and Georgi,</i>

37:32.818 --> 37:36.353
<i>but this is hard for me
because, Georgi's lied to my face.</i>

37:36.355 --> 37:37.988
He's lied to us all.

37:37.990 --> 37:42.025
And that does not give me any
confidence that my sister is in good hands.

37:46.063 --> 37:47.264
Sighs...

37:59.410 --> 38:00.977
Not really hungry.

38:01.912 --> 38:03.446
Yeah, I just want to
cut to the chase.

38:03.448 --> 38:05.215
This is very awkward.

38:11.355 --> 38:14.357
I feel like, you need to clear
the air a little bit.

38:54.465 --> 38:58.201
It's hard for us to accept this
because, it's like here we go again.

39:12.450 --> 39:15.719
I know it's a lot for you guys to
understand were we are coming from,

39:15.721 --> 39:19.856
but I really truly feel that
these counselling sessions

39:19.858 --> 39:22.859
that we wanna continue to do
are truly going to help us.

39:22.861 --> 39:25.261
The first session was...

39:25.830 --> 39:27.797
an amazing experience.

39:27.799 --> 39:31.668
And Georgi has been showing
more effort and...

39:31.670 --> 39:33.403
I see the shift.

39:35.139 --> 39:40.076
So, there's something that I
wanted to run by you guys

39:41.712 --> 39:45.382
I think it would be really beneficial
if Georgi comes on this trip,

39:47.284 --> 39:50.954
so, we can continue to work
on our relationship.

39:50.956 --> 39:54.758
It's not going to interrupt with
work, that's first and foremost.

39:54.760 --> 39:57.227
But, I don't feel like he
deserves to come to Miami.

39:58.963 --> 40:02.065
But, it's my company too,
so, yeah.

40:06.670 --> 40:07.904
Darcey...

40:07.906 --> 40:10.407
I don't wanna be around the
drama, we don't need that.

40:10.409 --> 40:14.144
And I don't want the drama either
and Georgi respects that and knows that.

40:20.217 --> 40:22.786
I'm not necessarily on board
with that because, I feel like...

40:22.788 --> 40:26.790
You guys have a lot of work to do and I
feel like you haven't really proven yourself

40:26.792 --> 40:30.260
in your love, to my sister,
to deserve to go on this trip.

40:30.661 --> 40:34.030
But hey, it is what it
is at this point.

40:35.900 --> 40:38.401
<i>[Stacey] I don't know what's
going on in Darcey's head.</i>

40:38.403 --> 40:41.771
<i>Why she keeps putting herself
in this cycle of being hurt.</i>

40:41.773 --> 40:43.873
<i>And if she wants
to live like that</i>

40:43.875 --> 40:47.444
there's nothing really
that I can do.

40:47.446 --> 40:51.681
<i>But it's hard because this
time, this affects me.</i>

40:51.683 --> 40:54.651
<i>The fact is, I'm really concerned
that Georgi's gonna cause</i>

40:54.653 --> 40:58.655
<i>so much stress and
drama in Miami,</i>

40:58.657 --> 41:01.891
that it's gonna jeopardize the
success of the fashion show.

41:01.893 --> 41:03.359
And that would be devastating.

41:05.429 --> 41:07.430
[sighs] We'll see what happens.

41:13.270 --> 41:16.806
- Look at, oh my!
- Oh my God. Sexy!

41:16.808 --> 41:19.909
It's definitely not competition
when it comes to our runway walk.

41:19.911 --> 41:21.211
- You guys look awesome.
- Yeah give a kiss.

41:21.213 --> 41:23.179
[indistinct]

41:24.548 --> 41:26.416
[crowd cheering]

41:26.418 --> 41:30.253
Today's the day of Aniko's
Miss Teen Connecticut pageant.

41:30.320 --> 41:31.988
I'm so excited.

41:32.223 --> 41:38.027
[announcer] Okay, we have some very special
award to give out to the ladies tonight.

41:38.029 --> 41:42.065
I'm so proud of Aniko and I want her
to win, but I'm a little nervous right now

41:44.802 --> 41:46.769
I know in the past we...

41:46.771 --> 41:47.437
Over indulged

41:47.439 --> 41:48.404
You've set up the budget?

41:48.406 --> 41:50.740
-Actually -It's already
been taken care of

41:50.742 --> 41:54.644
My daughters first decided to go to LA,
they were spending too much too quickly,

41:54.646 --> 41:56.946
too many unfocused activities.

41:56.948 --> 41:59.282
I'm not going to contribute,
like I did before.

42:01.085 --> 42:03.086
Miami, here we come.

42:04.955 --> 42:06.956
[instrumental music playing]

42:06.958 --> 42:09.692
- Here we are.
- Whoo!

42:09.694 --> 42:12.795
Hold on. I'm stuck
to the leather. Ouch.

42:12.797 --> 42:14.964
That's what I'm talking about.

42:16.433 --> 42:19.168
- [screaming] Oh, my God.
- No!

42:20.404 --> 42:22.972
<i>[Darcey] I'm so glad that
everyone's getting along.</i>

42:22.974 --> 42:24.974
Because Stace and I have
a lot riding in this trip.

42:24.976 --> 42:28.344
And if our show fails,
it risks our whole company.
