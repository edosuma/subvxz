00:01.793 --> 00:05.714
CHARLES: A great true crime mystery
unpeels itself like an onion.

00:06.131 --> 00:08.842
MABEL: What the fuck is "G. M."?
[typing]

00:09.468 --> 00:11.386
CHARLES:
I am looking for a guy

00:11.386 --> 00:13.931
I saw going up the stairs

00:13.931 --> 00:16.308
in a tie‐dyed hoodie the night Tim died.

00:16.308 --> 00:19.102
‐ Enough with Tie‐Dye Guy!
‐ We cannot forget about Tie‐Dye Guy!

00:19.102 --> 00:20.812
‐ So, Dad, I listened to your podcast.

00:20.812 --> 00:22.606
You didn't tell me you were
doing it with Mabel Mora.

00:22.606 --> 00:24.483
‐ Why? You know her?
‐ She used to stay here.

00:24.483 --> 00:26.902
She hung out with this group of kids,
and one of them was Tim Kono.

00:26.902 --> 00:30.197
‐ You can't disappear for 10 years,
then show up and start dragging up

00:30.197 --> 00:31.949
a bunch of shit from when we were kids!

00:31.949 --> 00:34.993
I saw someone fighting with her.
‐ You saw Oscar?

00:34.993 --> 00:36.370
‐ No. Someone else.

00:36.370 --> 00:38.997
MABEL: You know what happened that night.
You didn't even say anything.

00:38.997 --> 00:41.500
OLIVER: Just when it's all
starting to feel the same,

00:41.500 --> 00:43.377
that's when you get hit by something

00:43.377 --> 00:45.712
you never saw coming.

00:54.221 --> 00:56.223
MAN:
Value. Worth.

00:57.349 --> 00:58.851
The price of life.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.896
What's the easiest way to know
how you fit into the equation?

01:03.772 --> 01:04.815
Come to New York.

01:06.233 --> 01:08.235
Shit just plain costs more in the city.

01:09.194 --> 01:11.363
Subway fare is $2.75.

01:12.364 --> 01:14.533
The inflation of Hot Cheetos?

01:14.533 --> 01:16.034
99 cents in the Bronx,

01:16.034 --> 01:18.912
nearly four freaking dollars in Tribeca.

01:20.956 --> 01:22.791
Those joints?

01:22.791 --> 01:24.710
Overpriced as fuck.

01:25.169 --> 01:27.296
Not like that coat though.

01:27.296 --> 01:29.798
That... is priceless.

01:30.716 --> 01:33.010
It's special. Just like her.

01:45.814 --> 01:48.400
‐ I will take you down to the bone,
motherfucker!

01:48.400 --> 01:51.403
‐ Twist! Big, big twist!

01:51.403 --> 01:53.780
We have an unexpected turn of events,

01:53.780 --> 01:55.532
thanks to my son Will.

01:55.532 --> 01:59.244
Mabel knew Tim Kono and lied about it,

01:59.244 --> 02:02.414
which probably means that
Mabel killed Tim Kono.

02:02.414 --> 02:04.875
And now, we're wondering was he the first

02:04.875 --> 02:07.503
or the latest in her wild spree?

02:07.503 --> 02:09.713
‐ Yeah, because
she totally fits the profile.

02:09.713 --> 02:13.050
Female, late 20s, wears cool boots,
reads the Hardy Boys.

02:13.050 --> 02:15.302
When I see that on a resume,
I'm thinking murderer...

02:15.302 --> 02:19.014
‐ No real job, few attachments,
and lives alone!

02:19.014 --> 02:22.100
In an empty apartment that
probably has a drain in the floor!

02:22.100 --> 02:24.144
[beep]
Oh, that was some good back and forth.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.271
Listeners love conflict.
[ding, doors open]

02:26.271 --> 02:28.273
‐ You're a simpleton.
‐ Damn it! I didn't get that.

02:28.273 --> 02:30.484
[beep]
Can you call me a simpleton again?

02:30.484 --> 02:31.985
‐ You're a simpleton!
‐ Oh, thank you!

02:34.029 --> 02:35.864
‐ Oh my god. Oscar?

02:35.864 --> 02:37.157
‐ Damn, bella!

02:37.157 --> 02:39.701
‐ [laughs] I'm so sorry!

02:39.701 --> 02:41.203
You got out!

02:41.203 --> 02:43.705
I can't believe you're
standing right here.

02:43.705 --> 02:45.874
‐ Yeah, right? Me, too.

02:45.874 --> 02:48.669
‐ Wait, so did you just get out?
I went by your dad's,

02:48.669 --> 02:50.295
and he basically told me to fuck off.

02:50.963 --> 02:54.132
‐ Yeah, shit. No, I got out last week.

02:54.132 --> 02:57.553
‐ You knew that I was waiting here,
and you get out

02:57.553 --> 02:59.054
after 10 years and you don't call me?

02:59.471 --> 03:02.224
You just follow me down the street
like some fuckin' creeper?

03:02.224 --> 03:04.184
‐ Look, I had a whole plan.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.603
Can we just go chill? Where you headed?

03:06.603 --> 03:08.939
‐ Jersey.
‐ Well then, I'm going to Jersey.

03:08.939 --> 03:09.982
I'll drive you.

03:12.109 --> 03:14.069
‐ Oh! You don't have to drive, though.

03:14.069 --> 03:16.196
‐ Yes, I do have to.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.574
I've been waiting a long time for this.

03:18.574 --> 03:20.450
For this.

03:21.159 --> 03:22.619
‐ Me, too.

03:23.328 --> 03:25.914
Now, come on, you creeper.
‐ Ah...

03:28.917 --> 03:30.878
‐ Lester said he saw her head west.

03:30.878 --> 03:33.672
‐ Can you just calm down and think
a minute? This is all a misunderstanding‐‐

03:33.672 --> 03:35.924
‐ Haven't I been telling you
there's something off with Mabel?

03:35.924 --> 03:39.094
She's got those crazy killer eyes,
like Liza at 3:00 in the morning.

03:39.094 --> 03:40.637
‐ Please don't tell that story again.

03:40.637 --> 03:43.348
‐ She and Jessica Lange came to me
after an evening at Studio 54,

03:43.348 --> 03:45.934
and I had had a few cocktails.
‐ And I had had a few cocktails! Stop!

03:45.934 --> 03:48.979
Mabel is a sweet young woman who
promised not to keep secrets from us.

03:48.979 --> 03:50.981
I've been meaning to ask.
Is this your hat?

03:50.981 --> 03:53.567
‐ My hat! I thought I'd lost it‐‐ What?
‐ Oh my god, there she is!

03:54.484 --> 03:57.070
CHARLES [whispers]
Oh! Tie‐Dye Guy.

03:57.070 --> 04:00.532
It's Tie‐Dye Guy!
‐ Okay, w‐w‐we gotta follow them.

04:00.532 --> 04:03.243
I'm gonna get my car. You stay on them.
‐ Alright, I'll wait‐‐

04:03.243 --> 04:05.996
Wait! You have a car?
‐ Go after them on foot, and then call me

04:05.996 --> 04:08.373
when you know where they are,
and then I'll swing by and pick you up!

04:08.373 --> 04:09.875
‐ Okay! I'll wai‐‐

04:09.875 --> 04:12.252
You pay for parking here?!

05:02.302 --> 05:04.805
‐ This is bad! They're getting away!
OLIVER [on phone]: You on them?

05:04.805 --> 05:07.724
‐ I'm on them, but I can't outrun a Camry!
OLIVER: Stay on them!

05:07.724 --> 05:09.434
‐ Oh god, I hope they don't see me.

05:11.103 --> 05:13.230
Oh jeez...

05:13.230 --> 05:16.108
‐ So, where we going?
MABEL: It's in Teaneck,

05:16.108 --> 05:17.526
so...

05:17.526 --> 05:19.152
GW Bridge.

05:24.074 --> 05:26.034
‐ Welcome to New York.

05:26.034 --> 05:27.619
Thank you, ma'am!

05:28.412 --> 05:30.956
Oliver, I ca‐‐ I can't hear you!
Are you there?

05:30.956 --> 05:33.458
OLIVER [on phone]: Yeah,
I might cut out a little bit, but stay on!

05:33.458 --> 05:36.170
‐ Oh! Oh, thank god.

05:36.170 --> 05:38.547
They're stuck in traffic.
[honking]

05:38.547 --> 05:41.633
Where are you? I'll take one.

05:41.633 --> 05:44.761
OLIVER: Wait, are you
at that pretzel cart? I want one.

05:44.761 --> 05:46.263
Read out the toppings!
‐ What? What toppings?

05:46.263 --> 05:47.431
There's mustard and salt.

05:47.431 --> 05:49.683
OLIVER: Yeah, but you know,
sometimes there's honey mustard.

05:49.683 --> 05:52.394
Is it Dante?
Tell him Oliver wants his usual!

05:52.394 --> 05:54.146
‐ Are you Dante?
‐ Yep.

05:54.146 --> 05:57.274
‐ Oliver wants his usual.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

05:57.274 --> 05:59.109
OLIVER:
I'm coming around!

05:59.109 --> 06:02.112
Are you still on 88th?
‐ Yeah, uh, traffic's moving!

06:02.112 --> 06:03.822
Where are you?

06:03.822 --> 06:05.073
OLIVER:
Turn around!

06:10.621 --> 06:12.122
‐ Very inconspicuous!
[door opens, shuts]

06:12.122 --> 06:14.041
‐ We blend in by standing out.

06:15.125 --> 06:18.003
‐ What are you doing?
‐ No, no, no. You drive because...

06:19.046 --> 06:22.549
...I gotta record, and also my driver's
license expired 25 years ago.

06:22.549 --> 06:24.927
‐ Keep your eyes on that Camry!
[shuts door]

06:31.558 --> 06:32.893
What are you doing with this car?

06:32.893 --> 06:36.563
‐ This is Aphrodite.
I got her in LA when I was filming

06:36.563 --> 06:38.941
Singin' In The Rain 2 for VH1.

06:38.941 --> 06:42.319
‐ Oh! Look, in the ashtray.
It's a jelly bean from 1963.

06:42.319 --> 06:43.946
‐ Maybe it's a Mexican diet pill.

06:45.322 --> 06:47.282
Oh yeah. It's a fen‐phen!

06:47.282 --> 06:50.160
Mm! Mm. Know what? I don't need this.

06:51.078 --> 06:52.246
Left! They're turning left.

06:57.709 --> 06:59.837
‐ So if you've been out for a week,
what have you been doing?

07:01.088 --> 07:02.840
‐ I had some decent food.

07:02.840 --> 07:04.383
Got a haircut.

07:04.383 --> 07:06.969
Went to the bathroom without somebody
looking at me. That was fun.

07:09.972 --> 07:12.307
‐ Did you hear about Tim?

07:13.308 --> 07:16.311
‐ Yeah.
My first night out, he offs himself?

07:18.105 --> 07:20.941
My first time stepping back
in that building?

07:20.941 --> 07:22.943
‐ Wait, you were there that...

07:24.736 --> 07:27.531
Oh my god, you're Tie‐Dye Guy!

07:27.531 --> 07:28.991
‐ Yeah! I'm trying to be.

07:28.991 --> 07:31.159
Figured I'd get some
new drip when I got out.

07:34.037 --> 07:37.040
‐ I think she's in trouble. That's the guy
I saw going up the stairs that night.

07:37.040 --> 07:39.376
‐ I know! Tie‐Dye!

07:39.376 --> 07:42.546
He and Mabel were probably
in on this from the start.

07:42.546 --> 07:44.715
And you noticed when
you brought up his name,

07:44.715 --> 07:46.758
she got very quiet and had us
looking at other suspects.

07:46.758 --> 07:49.303
‐ Actually, it was you who did that.

07:49.303 --> 07:51.388
You've gotta stop thinking
the worst of her.

07:51.388 --> 07:53.265
‐ And you need to start.

07:53.265 --> 07:56.435
She lied to us, Charles,
or did you miss that fact?

07:56.435 --> 07:59.938
‐ She also helped us investigate.
Why would she do that?

07:59.938 --> 08:02.774
‐ Oh, I don't know. Maybe to
throw us off the scent of herself.

08:02.774 --> 08:05.944
It's a classic true crime podcast move.
Right out of

08:05.944 --> 08:07.946
Daddy's Little Helper.
‐ Daddy's Little Helper.

08:07.946 --> 08:11.116
‐ Exactly. That's right.
The forlorn son helps with the case,

08:11.116 --> 08:13.410
until all evidence points to him.
‐ Yeah.

08:13.410 --> 08:16.622
That podcast stunk, by the way.
They gave away everything in the title.

08:16.622 --> 08:18.874
I mean, I wonder who did it?
Daddy's little helper?

08:18.874 --> 08:20.584
‐ Don't you hear yourself?

08:21.293 --> 08:24.838
You're thinking like the patsy,
the sucker. Not the detective.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.383
Charles, buddy, just...

08:28.383 --> 08:31.261
Please, just drop what you're feeling,

08:31.261 --> 08:33.764
and think only about what you know.

08:37.476 --> 08:40.938
‐ We can't forget about Tie‐Dye Guy.

08:40.938 --> 08:43.440
‐ Charles, we can't just suspect someone

08:43.440 --> 08:46.151
because they're wearing a hoodie.
It's like a huge no.

08:46.151 --> 08:49.738
‐ I'm not doing that.
Well, I am doing that, but not like that.

08:50.864 --> 08:53.617
Okay, fine. I'm just saying...
Tie‐Dye Guy.

08:53.617 --> 08:56.286
‐ Enough with the Tie‐Dye Guy.

08:56.286 --> 08:57.788
It's just a waste of time.

09:09.466 --> 09:10.884
‐ What?
MABEL: Nothing.

09:10.884 --> 09:14.346
It just feels like I'm sitting
next to your older brother.

09:14.346 --> 09:17.349
‐ You know, you were actually the first
person I wanted to see after my dad.

09:18.559 --> 09:21.979
That's why I was heading up the stairs
the night everything went crazy.

09:21.979 --> 09:24.106
In case you were wondering.

09:36.702 --> 09:39.371
I was heading up to see you
at your aunt's place.

09:41.957 --> 09:45.210
‐ It's weird that we didn't pass
each other in the stairwell.

09:48.380 --> 09:49.506
‐ Maybe we did.

09:50.841 --> 09:53.177
You did miss me sneaking up on you
this morning.

09:53.177 --> 09:54.803
‐ [laughs] I didn't miss shit.

09:54.803 --> 09:56.597
[Oscar sighs]
MABEL: Besides,

09:56.597 --> 09:59.725
I've always wanted to kill
someone with my knitting needle.

09:59.725 --> 10:03.437
‐ I saw you once with those guys
that look like retired cops.

10:03.437 --> 10:04.813
Was one of them that Brazzos guy?

10:05.397 --> 10:07.482
‐ [sighs] Yeah.

10:07.482 --> 10:09.735
He kinda still thinks he's on that show.

10:09.735 --> 10:11.153
‐ Okay, I'm gonna call her.

10:11.153 --> 10:13.322
When she's screaming
bloody murder, you'll see.

10:13.322 --> 10:15.324
[Oliver sighs]
‐ Call Mabel Mora.

10:16.575 --> 10:18.702
MABEL [on voicemail]: Hey, it's Mabel.
Leave a message at the tone.

10:18.702 --> 10:21.205
‐ See that? If she's so safe,
why didn't she pick up?

10:21.205 --> 10:24.541
‐ Oh, trust me. She's too busy planning
her next murder with Clyde.

10:24.541 --> 10:26.418
Let's hope it's not one of us.

10:26.418 --> 10:28.170
Hey! Found something.

10:28.170 --> 10:30.422
An article from the Post years ago

10:30.422 --> 10:32.633
about what Will told us.
‐ And?

10:32.633 --> 10:36.428
‐ A girl named Zoe Cassidy
was pushed off the roof of the Arconia.

10:36.845 --> 10:38.680
Police arrested a resident.

10:38.680 --> 10:41.600
I kinda remember some of this.
‐ I don't.

10:41.600 --> 10:43.143
When did this happen?
‐ 2010.

10:43.143 --> 10:45.979
How does this not sound
even vaguely familiar to you?

10:45.979 --> 10:48.565
‐ 2010... That was my Prednisone year.

10:48.565 --> 10:51.026
I got really bloated,
and it played with my memory.

10:51.026 --> 10:53.779
[Siri beeps]
OLIVER: Search "Charles‐Haden Savage fat."

10:53.779 --> 10:57.658
[beeps]
Ooh! [laughs] Look at the ass on papa.

10:57.658 --> 10:59.868
‐ Oh...
‐ Jesus, you're huge.

10:59.868 --> 11:01.662
[car squeaking]
Looks like you're wearing a turtleneck.

11:01.662 --> 11:03.622
Oh no, don't worry.
It‐it's just warming up.

11:03.622 --> 11:06.708
I don't think Aphrodite's ever
been driven in the winter.

11:20.806 --> 11:22.975
CHARLES:
You know what? I'm gonna try Mabel again.

11:26.562 --> 11:28.689
[vibrating]
MABEL: Oh god.

11:28.689 --> 11:31.024
[clears throat] Hey!

11:31.024 --> 11:32.693
‐ Ooh!

11:32.693 --> 11:35.654
‐ Hey. Mabel! Hi! It's Charles.
‐ [whispers] Play it cool.

11:35.654 --> 11:39.533
‐ I‐I was worried about you after that
last dead end. Do you wanna get together?

11:39.533 --> 11:41.034
‐ For coffee.
‐ For tea?

11:41.910 --> 11:44.830
‐ Yeah, no, no, no.
I‐I'm good. I'm just, uh,

11:44.830 --> 11:47.708
chilling at Washington Square Park, so...

11:47.708 --> 11:49.918
Yeah, thanks for calling, and I'll just

11:49.918 --> 11:52.379
talk to you later.
[Oscar scoffing]

11:53.881 --> 11:55.591
‐ You're lying to your boyfriend
'cause you feel like

11:55.591 --> 11:57.885
even the way you're thinking
about me is cheating?

11:59.261 --> 12:00.721
‐ I don't have a boyfriend.

12:04.474 --> 12:08.061
‐ Like Cassandra and Lady Macbeth
rolled into one!

12:08.061 --> 12:09.938
‐ No, she can't say anything.

12:09.938 --> 12:13.442
So, "just chilling," is code for,
"help, I've been taken hostage."

12:16.695 --> 12:18.614
‐ It's tough...

12:18.614 --> 12:20.699
to believe that she could be...

12:20.699 --> 12:23.118
this duplicitous, I know.

12:24.244 --> 12:27.789
Tougher because you're
a closed‐off person,

12:27.789 --> 12:30.876
and Mabel made you...

12:30.876 --> 12:33.587
open up and trust people
for the first time.

12:35.923 --> 12:38.342
So now, the thought that
she might not be who she seems

12:38.342 --> 12:40.844
has you questioning it all.

12:42.179 --> 12:43.597
Okay, I gotta try that again.

12:43.597 --> 12:45.599
That was very fake sounding.
‐ You fucker!

12:51.438 --> 12:54.358
‐ So, G. M., Shore Road.

12:54.358 --> 12:56.777
You sure Tim was going to a jewelry shop?

12:56.777 --> 13:00.239
‐ It's this whole Hardy Boys
thing I cracked.

13:00.697 --> 13:03.450
‐ Oh. You cracked it.

13:03.450 --> 13:04.618
Cool.

13:05.077 --> 13:08.497
Or... could it have something
to do with something else?

13:13.043 --> 13:15.712
‐ Okay, so we all got the same tattoo.

13:15.712 --> 13:17.923
‐ And?

13:17.923 --> 13:20.926
Who gave them to us?
‐ My cousin Tavo.

13:20.926 --> 13:23.470
‐ And what's your cousin
Tavo's government name?

13:23.470 --> 13:25.264
‐ Gustavo Mora.

13:25.264 --> 13:28.308
‐ G. M.? With a tattoo shop on Shore Road?

13:28.934 --> 13:31.520
‐ Fuck me! How did I miss that?

13:31.520 --> 13:33.397
W‐‐ You‐you have to take this exit.

13:33.397 --> 13:35.190
We have to go to Bayport.
[tires squeal]

13:35.190 --> 13:36.316
‐ Hold on!

13:43.073 --> 13:45.909
Long Island. My first time
out of Manhattan in five years,

13:45.909 --> 13:47.619
and we're going to Long Island.

13:47.619 --> 13:49.454
‐ Don't you go to the Hamptons?
CHARLES: Never.

13:49.454 --> 13:51.623
I got a sister in Patchogue.

13:51.623 --> 13:54.168
She has four daughters, all with D names.

13:54.168 --> 13:57.546
[Long Island accent]
Dawn, Danielle, Dina, and Dagmar.

13:57.546 --> 14:00.299
The five of them are always
trying to set me up with a hairdresser.

14:00.299 --> 14:02.759
‐ Well, I have to admit I have certainly

14:02.759 --> 14:05.470
had my share of Long Island shenanigans.

14:05.470 --> 14:08.640
[chuckling] I re‐‐ I remember one time,

14:08.640 --> 14:10.601
uh, I'd had a few cocktails,

14:10.601 --> 14:13.103
and, uh, on a dare, I rode an elephant

14:13.103 --> 14:16.565
and then threw up in a pool
at a wedding in Syosset.

14:17.274 --> 14:20.485
I once shot an episode of
Brazzos in Hempstead.

14:20.485 --> 14:22.070
It doubled for Bosnia.

14:22.070 --> 14:24.323
‐ I once got syphilis in South Setauket.

14:24.323 --> 14:27.117
‐ And I got crabs in Massapequa.

14:27.117 --> 14:30.204
‐ [laughs] Ooh, I got
the clap in Amagansett.

14:30.204 --> 14:33.790
‐ And I got saggy‐bottom balls
in Sag Harbor.

14:34.917 --> 14:37.586
‐ ♪ Saggy Bottom Balls
is what she called me ♪

14:37.586 --> 14:38.837

14:47.638 --> 14:50.933
‐ ♪ Boom boom boom boom,
Saggy Bottom Balls is what she called me ♪

14:50.933 --> 14:52.726
‐ Okay, now I'm gonna
be singing that all day.

14:54.937 --> 14:57.481
We've got smoke!
OLIVER: Don't worry, don't worry.

14:57.481 --> 14:59.608
Just pull over there so they don't see us.

15:06.657 --> 15:09.993
‐ I'll give her $5 worth of diesel,
she'll be fine!

15:09.993 --> 15:12.454
‐ Why not fill her up?
‐ Where are we going, to the moon?

15:12.454 --> 15:14.581
It's a shallow tank.

15:15.332 --> 15:17.376
‐ Hey, you might wanna pop the hood.

15:17.376 --> 15:18.710
‐ No thanks, we're fine.

15:19.878 --> 15:21.713

"This sends the damn day
in a brand new direction!"

15:28.345 --> 15:30.681
‐ "Whole new direction," but, yeah.
That's me.

15:30.681 --> 15:33.725
‐ [laughs] Shit!
Yo, let's see what we got here, yeah?

15:33.725 --> 15:37.062
‐ Hey, do you think the attendant
can sell me some brine?

15:37.062 --> 15:39.231
I need to replenish her sodium levels.

15:39.231 --> 15:41.191
‐ [laughs] Brine, man! I like that!

15:41.191 --> 15:43.861
Wherever you're going,
you might not be going in this.

15:52.619 --> 15:53.996
ATTENDANT: 4.50.
‐ Uh,

15:53.996 --> 15:57.416
could I also grab a lighter,
some batteries, and‐‐

15:57.416 --> 16:00.627
[gasps] Strawberry lube! Oh wait,
that gave you a reaction last time.

16:00.627 --> 16:01.837
‐ [laughs] Oh, this one.

16:01.837 --> 16:03.630
‐ We've got bubblegum lube.

16:03.630 --> 16:04.882
MABEL:
Perfect. We'll take that,

16:04.882 --> 16:07.301
and some ginseng and Spanish fly.

16:07.301 --> 16:10.220
Oh also, what size condoms do you have?
He needs slim fit,

16:10.220 --> 16:12.973
extra long.
We don't want it to fall off again.

16:13.765 --> 16:17.019

‐ Alright, I'm... I'm gonna go.

16:17.019 --> 16:17.978
‐ Thank you.

16:20.522 --> 16:23.317

‐ Oh, look at them. Laughing.

16:27.905 --> 16:30.741
[Aphrodite hissing]
Not a care in the world. And you're right.

16:30.741 --> 16:32.659
She does wear cool boots.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.870
‐ She's not kidnapped.

She played me, too.

can tow this for you.

16:42.377 --> 16:44.922
Take it to a shop, he could use the work.

16:44.922 --> 16:47.633
I can give you a lift. I'm Lucien.

16:47.633 --> 16:50.385

Why aren't we moving?

17:17.162 --> 17:20.207

My cousin just picked up two white boys.

17:37.558 --> 17:39.852

driving a terrarium.

17:41.353 --> 17:43.814
‐ So, who are we following.
OLIVER: Well,

17:43.814 --> 17:47.234
we're doing a podcast based on
a murder in the building we live in,

17:47.234 --> 17:50.279
and the girl in the car is one
of the cohosts, but now, we think

17:50.279 --> 17:52.489
she may have had something
to do with the whole thing.

17:52.489 --> 17:55.951
‐ Damn! You know, Vaughn and I,
we got a little podcast.

17:55.951 --> 17:58.537
It's called Yard Dogs:

17:58.537 --> 18:01.665
Your Favorite Horticulture Homies.
OLIVER: Aw,

18:01.665 --> 18:04.334
good for you guys.
Giving it the old college try.

18:04.334 --> 18:06.253
That's... that's so sweet.
VAUGHN: Yeah,

as one of the best new podcasts.

18:10.841 --> 18:13.844

a little something‐something.

18:19.308 --> 18:22.644
‐ We, uh, met Cinda Canning.
We have an in with her.

LUCIEN:
Yeah, we part of Cinda's network, man.

18:28.734 --> 18:31.320
The only thing green she loves
more than money

18:31.320 --> 18:33.572
is our plants! [laughs]

18:33.572 --> 18:35.365
She's really the third horticulture homie.

18:35.365 --> 18:37.451
‐ Oh. That's, that's...

18:37.451 --> 18:39.953
uh, that's great.

18:46.877 --> 18:49.129
‐ What party of Long Island is this?

18:49.129 --> 18:50.756
‐ Ah, this is Bayport, baby.

18:50.756 --> 18:52.925
Every time I come out here,
some shit pops off.

18:53.592 --> 18:55.761
‐ What are they doing out here?
‐ I don't know.

18:55.761 --> 18:57.721
Maybe they're going to
murder someone else.

18:57.721 --> 19:01.141
‐ Stop calling her a murderer.
She's an innocent young woman.

19:01.141 --> 19:03.185
‐ So, this girl...

19:03.810 --> 19:05.771
she was helping you solve the murder,

19:05.771 --> 19:07.481
but now you think she's involved?

19:08.232 --> 19:10.734
‐ Pretty much.
‐ [scoffs] Damn.

19:13.445 --> 19:15.572
‐ Just because things
aren't what they seem,

19:15.572 --> 19:18.951
doesn't mean she's a bad person.
Maybe she just doesn't trust y'all yet.

19:19.952 --> 19:21.537
‐ Or she's mistletoe.

19:22.579 --> 19:25.165
Which is actually a toxic parasite. Mm.

19:25.165 --> 19:28.502
The very plant that encourages
us to kiss at holiday time

19:28.502 --> 19:30.546
can actually kill the tree it hangs on.

19:30.546 --> 19:33.465
Little do you know,
all that romance is happening

19:33.465 --> 19:35.259
under a tree assassin.

19:42.516 --> 19:45.686
‐ [sighs] Okay. Now, let's go see why Tim
was hanging out with my sketchy cousin.

19:45.686 --> 19:48.230
OSCAR:
Yo, I know we just drove out here,

19:48.230 --> 19:50.399
but can we please let this go?

19:51.567 --> 19:54.903
It's been... 10 years since...

19:54.903 --> 19:56.363
I had ice cream.

19:57.447 --> 20:00.450
With a girl. On a beach.

20:00.450 --> 20:02.202
It doesn't even have to be Haagen‐Dazs.

20:02.202 --> 20:05.205
It could be a nasty Smurf pop
from a dude with a cooler.

20:06.790 --> 20:08.959
‐ I do want to do that.

20:08.959 --> 20:10.919
I do. I...

20:10.919 --> 20:12.421
But this is important.

20:13.422 --> 20:15.424
What happened ruined your life,

20:15.424 --> 20:17.509
and now Tim is dead.

20:17.509 --> 20:19.136
I just need some answers.

20:19.720 --> 20:22.097
‐ I'm trying to move forward with my life.

20:22.097 --> 20:23.098
I got goals.

20:23.098 --> 20:26.810
In prison, I started trap yoga,
and I got certified.

20:26.810 --> 20:28.437
I want to open up a studio.

20:29.438 --> 20:30.939
‐ Yoga?
‐ Yeah!

20:30.939 --> 20:32.566
I'm positive as fuck!

20:32.566 --> 20:34.109
And figuring out why

20:34.109 --> 20:36.445
some asshole died doesn't
do shit for my inner calm.

20:37.070 --> 20:39.740
‐ I get it. This isn't the most

20:39.740 --> 20:42.868
positive‐as‐fuck thing
you could be doing right now.

20:46.747 --> 20:47.873
But I have to.

20:49.458 --> 20:51.877
‐ And I have to not.

20:54.505 --> 20:56.548
‐ Okay, I'll just catch
the train back later.

21:03.805 --> 21:07.309
OSCAR: When you get outta prison
and try to restart your life,

21:07.309 --> 21:09.478
you hope to get back to the good parts

21:09.478 --> 21:10.979
and leave the bad behind.

21:12.564 --> 21:15.025
[shuts door]
But just because you aren't locked up,

21:15.025 --> 21:17.528
doesn't mean you aren't
still in some kind of prison.

21:27.454 --> 21:29.665
‐ What the fuck are you guys doing here?

21:29.665 --> 21:32.125
‐ Well, we could say
the same thing about you.

21:32.125 --> 21:34.753
‐ Yeah. How was it chillin'
in Washington Square Park?

21:34.753 --> 21:36.463
Was it, like, so chill?

21:36.463 --> 21:38.131
Did you chill it up so hard?

21:38.131 --> 21:39.341
‐ Jesus...

21:39.341 --> 21:40.843
‐ Did you follow me?

21:42.052 --> 21:45.305
That is so messed up!
‐ No, no! What is messed up

21:45.305 --> 21:47.266
is that you lied to me,
and you lied to him,

21:47.266 --> 21:49.017
and we promised each other
we wouldn't do that!

21:49.017 --> 21:51.019
‐ He's very wounded, Mabel.

21:51.019 --> 21:53.021
I'm made of stronger stuff, but he's‐‐

21:53.021 --> 21:54.648
‐ I'm sorry.

21:54.648 --> 21:56.567
‐ Did you know Tim Kono?

21:58.235 --> 21:59.278
‐ Yes.

22:00.237 --> 22:01.947
‐ Did you have something to do with‐‐

22:01.947 --> 22:03.699
‐ Wow, Charles.

22:03.699 --> 22:05.492
Just say it out loud.

22:05.492 --> 22:07.494
Say it out loud if that's
what you think of me.

22:07.911 --> 22:11.748
‐ It‐it's not what I think‐‐ I'm just...
I'm just very confused.

22:13.458 --> 22:16.211
‐ I know. And I'll...

22:16.211 --> 22:18.213
explain it to you guys.

22:19.173 --> 22:21.675
Tim was my friend, or he used to be.

22:21.675 --> 22:23.844
And I think that's why I'm so obsessed

22:23.844 --> 22:25.846
with solving this murder.
[door opens, bell rings]

22:26.889 --> 22:30.726
‐ Fuck it. I got way too much 'cause
I don't know what you're into anymore.

22:32.436 --> 22:34.062
‐ You came back.
CHARLES: Well!

22:34.062 --> 22:35.606
It's Tie‐Dye Guy.

22:36.481 --> 22:39.151
‐ This is Oscar. Also a friend.

22:39.151 --> 22:41.153
Also not the killer.

22:42.196 --> 22:44.114
‐ Brazzos?
‐ Yes.

22:44.114 --> 22:45.073
‐ Wow.

22:45.616 --> 22:48.619
‐ I saw you going up the stairs
the night Tim Kono was murdered.

22:48.619 --> 22:50.829
‐ I saw you shoot a crocodile
that was smuggling drugs.

22:52.039 --> 22:54.791
Uh, Brazzos was one of three
DVD sets in the prison library.

22:54.791 --> 22:57.085
‐ God, prison sounds like hell.

22:57.085 --> 23:00.130
What flavor do you have there?
OSCAR: Uh, vegan sea salt oil?

23:00.130 --> 23:03.509
‐ Jesus. When did ice cream
become a hand lotion?

23:03.509 --> 23:05.719
Fucking millennials.
Honest, they're so boring.

23:05.719 --> 23:07.554
Okay, I'll take the popsicle then.

23:07.554 --> 23:10.265
‐ You were going up to Tim's apartment
that night, weren't you?

23:10.265 --> 23:11.266
‐ No, he wasn't.

23:12.100 --> 23:14.603
‐ Yeah. I was.

23:16.355 --> 23:19.358
I'm sorry. I lied to you, Mabel.

23:20.067 --> 23:22.569
‐ I know I shouldn't have,
but it was just seeing you again‐‐

23:22.569 --> 23:24.905
‐ Oh my god, my head is
spinning with all these lies.

23:24.905 --> 23:26.240
‐ No, no, go on.

23:28.492 --> 23:30.327
‐ I went up to Tim's place that night.

23:30.327 --> 23:34.122
I‐I don't know what I was gonna do,
but I wasn't going to kill him.

23:34.122 --> 23:36.041
Maybe fuck him up a little bit.

23:37.084 --> 23:40.003
[alarm blaring, quietly]
But the alarm was going off, and then...

23:41.797 --> 23:44.800
[gunshot]
...and then, I heard a fucking gunshot.

23:47.928 --> 23:49.930
‐ You heard it?
‐ Yeah.

23:51.098 --> 23:52.891
I did.

23:53.517 --> 23:56.353
But I didn't murder Tim Kono.
[gate slams]

23:56.353 --> 23:59.022
‐ Tim was murdered?
[tattoo needle stops]

23:59.022 --> 24:01.400
Damn, he was right. Tim called it.

24:01.400 --> 24:03.318
‐ Does everybody know Tim Kono now?

24:03.318 --> 24:04.403
‐ What are you two doing here?

24:05.445 --> 24:07.531
‐ Hey, can you please explain

24:07.531 --> 24:10.659
who you are,
and what exactly you know‐‐

24:10.659 --> 24:12.578
[snorting] Brain freeze!

24:12.578 --> 24:15.622
‐ Oh, uh, use your thumb! Press the top
of your thumb... like that.

24:15.622 --> 24:18.709
‐ Like this? Mm! Mm...

24:18.709 --> 24:20.627
Oh my god.

24:20.627 --> 24:22.004
Tie‐Dye Guy is a genius.

24:22.004 --> 24:24.173
‐ Um, Tavo, what were you saying?

24:24.173 --> 24:26.049
Tim thought he was gonna get murdered?

24:26.049 --> 24:28.051
‐ Fuck yeah.

24:28.051 --> 24:31.805
He'd been trying to take down this
black market jewelry dealer named Angel.

24:31.805 --> 24:33.599
[tattoo needle starts]
‐ Tavo. May‐may I call you Tavo?

24:33.599 --> 24:35.017
‐ Well, what else would you call him?

24:35.017 --> 24:36.518
‐ Well, it could be
an affectionate nickname.

24:36.518 --> 24:37.686
I don't wanna overstep my bounds.

24:38.729 --> 24:41.857
Look, Tim Kono was a loner
who worked in a bank.

24:41.857 --> 24:44.067
Taking down a black market jewelry dealer

24:44.067 --> 24:46.320
seems a little off brand, don't you think?

24:47.154 --> 24:48.197
‐ Maybe.

24:49.531 --> 24:52.492
Then again, I found
all these in his apartment.

24:54.411 --> 24:57.831
‐ Whoa!
‐ Oh my god...

25:00.542 --> 25:02.211
Brain freeze! [snorts]
