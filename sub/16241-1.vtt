00:43.378 --> 00:45.046
Well, it's been

00:45.213 --> 00:47.674
Building up inside of me for

00:47.841 --> 00:51.845
Oh, I don't know how long

00:52.011 --> 00:53.847
I don't know why

00:54.013 --> 00:57.016
But I keep thinking something's bound

00:57.183 --> 00:59.644
To go wrong

00:59.811 --> 01:03.148
But she looks in my eyes

01:03.314 --> 01:06.401
And makes me realize

01:06.568 --> 01:07.819
When she says

01:07.986 --> 01:13.199
Don't worry, baby

01:13.366 --> 01:15.618
Everything will turn out all right

01:15.785 --> 01:22.751
Don't worry, baby

01:25.754 --> 01:28.423
I guess I should've
kept my mouth shut

01:28.590 --> 01:33.386
When I started
to brag about my car

01:33.553 --> 01:36.014
But I can't back down now

01:36.181 --> 01:41.186
Because I pushed
the other guys too far

01:41.352 --> 01:45.231
She makes me come alive

01:45.398 --> 01:49.194
And makes me wanna drive,
when she says

01:49.360 --> 01:55.158
Don't worry, baby

01:55.325 --> 01:57.702
Everything will turn out all right

01:57.869 --> 02:02.999
Don't worry, baby

02:03.166 --> 02:07.462
Everything will turn out all right...

02:07.629 --> 02:09.172
What is all that crap
on the windshield?

02:09.339 --> 02:11.466
It's ash from the fire.

02:13.259 --> 02:15.011
This is where you're bringing me?

02:15.178 --> 02:17.180
It's rent-free.

02:17.347 --> 02:19.516
Before or after it burns down?

02:19.682 --> 02:21.059
There's nothing to worry about.

02:21.226 --> 02:22.936
The fire's way
on the other side of the lake.

02:24.562 --> 02:26.397
I need a drink.

02:26.564 --> 02:28.566
That's Al Kaiser.

02:29.984 --> 02:30.902
There's Don Burke.

02:31.069 --> 02:33.822
He lives here full-time.

02:33.988 --> 02:37.116
Could use a little more lift
in that jump shot.

02:37.283 --> 02:38.785
Girls, go in the house.

02:38.952 --> 02:40.870
Fill up all the pots with water
and bring it on the front porch.

02:41.037 --> 02:42.622
We're on it!

02:42.789 --> 02:45.124
It's essential we remain
calm in a crisis.

02:45.291 --> 02:47.544
I'd hardly call it a crisis, Mother.

02:47.710 --> 02:49.838
This house has been
in my family for 83 years,

02:50.004 --> 02:52.131
and it's not gonna burn up on my watch.

02:52.298 --> 02:54.133
It can burn up on my watch.

02:55.301 --> 02:59.681
Hey, it's not that often that you see
a beautiful woman on the roof.

02:59.848 --> 03:02.976
Not nearly enough.

03:05.812 --> 03:06.646
Mom loves this stuff.

03:06.813 --> 03:08.231
So do I.

03:08.398 --> 03:10.358
You're both crazy.

03:11.609 --> 03:13.069
Mother!

03:13.236 --> 03:14.863
If my phone's ruined, you're dead!

03:16.447 --> 03:19.284
Mama!
Finny throwed water on Willow.

03:19.450 --> 03:21.744
Girls, I don't want you
to play with the water.

03:31.546 --> 03:33.006
All right.

03:33.172 --> 03:34.591
This is it.

03:35.592 --> 03:37.051
Does it have indoor plumbing?

03:37.218 --> 03:39.178
It's a nice place.

03:39.345 --> 03:40.930
Dog Dave wanted to sell it,

03:41.097 --> 03:42.974
but I convinced him
to wait a couple months.

03:43.141 --> 03:44.267
"Dog

03:44.434 --> 03:46.603
Yeah, he used to have four dogs.

03:46.769 --> 03:49.439
There's only one left,
but the name stuck.

03:50.440 --> 03:53.943
Anyway, he said you could stay here
for the summer.

03:54.110 --> 03:55.945
My good fortune.

03:56.112 --> 03:57.697
Come on, Uncle Monte.

03:57.864 --> 03:59.407
It'll be good for you.

03:59.574 --> 04:03.077
You can spend
the whole summer relaxing,

04:03.244 --> 04:04.579
taking in the beauty.

04:05.914 --> 04:07.916
Nothing to do except
for look after the dog.

04:12.962 --> 04:14.631
Make that nothing to do.

04:14.797 --> 04:17.175
Well, he'll come back
when he's hungry.

04:17.341 --> 04:18.885
Hopefully not.

04:19.052 --> 04:21.220
My mother has the blazing
inferno under control.

04:21.387 --> 04:22.847
It's okay to stand down, Mrs. O'Neil.

04:23.014 --> 04:24.432
The fire's been contained.

04:24.599 --> 04:26.434
Thanks for your cooperation, as always.

04:26.601 --> 04:27.727
Thank you, Captain.

04:27.894 --> 04:29.854
Finnegan throwed water on Willow.

04:30.021 --> 04:32.482
Well, I'm sure she'll be
a good firefighter someday.

04:32.649 --> 04:34.025
Just leave it there.

04:35.151 --> 04:36.986
I can do it myself.

04:37.153 --> 04:38.988
Don't need any help.

04:39.155 --> 04:42.158
Nice to see
you're keeping your spirits up.

04:48.289 --> 04:51.125
Here's your donut.
Is that all right?

04:51.292 --> 04:53.127
Yeah, I got it.

04:57.006 --> 05:00.176
Girls. It's not polite to stare.

05:07.141 --> 05:10.520
Why don't we go in
and have some lunch, okay? Come on.

05:24.325 --> 05:25.868
You wanna try it out?

05:26.869 --> 05:28.496
I need a drink.

05:28.663 --> 05:30.498
I'll get the typewriter.

05:30.665 --> 05:31.833
Toss it in the garbage.

05:32.959 --> 05:34.419
This might be
a good place to write.

05:34.585 --> 05:36.921
She's a black-hearted whore,
and I'm done with her.

05:59.360 --> 06:02.572
Aaah!

06:02.739 --> 06:04.699
What's he yelling at?

06:05.867 --> 06:07.035
Life.

06:12.165 --> 06:13.499
All righty.

06:20.339 --> 06:22.175
Just in case.

06:22.341 --> 06:26.012
You want me to write?
I'll write.

06:47.825 --> 06:49.744
Well, it's a start.

06:49.911 --> 06:50.912
Here.

06:54.290 --> 06:57.543
What, does this establishment
not provide its patrons with a proper glass?

06:57.710 --> 06:59.253
Why bother?

07:00.588 --> 07:04.634
If I start drinking straight out of the bottle,
young Henry,

07:04.801 --> 07:08.346
I will have most assuredly surrendered
the last vestige of propriety

07:08.513 --> 07:10.389
remaining in my life.

07:10.556 --> 07:15.228
And I shall, by all accounts,
consider myself a lost cause.

07:15.394 --> 07:18.106
Well, God knows we don't want that.

07:19.273 --> 07:21.109
I stocked the pantry for the summer,

07:21.275 --> 07:23.903
and there's plenty of Hungry-Man dinners
in the freezer.

07:24.070 --> 07:25.947
Here.
You can use this if you need to.

07:28.491 --> 07:29.992
Dog Dave left a note on the fridge

07:30.159 --> 07:31.702
about when
you're supposed to feed Ringo.

07:31.869 --> 07:33.579
And who is Ringo?

07:33.746 --> 07:35.164
That's the dog.

07:35.331 --> 07:37.208
What kind of name is that for a dog?

07:37.375 --> 07:39.836
Well, it was John, Paul,
George, and Ringo.

07:40.002 --> 07:40.837
Oh, clever.

07:42.672 --> 07:45.591
Don't expect me to take messages
along with all the rest of my duties.

07:45.758 --> 07:47.176
Hi, it's Dave.

07:47.343 --> 07:48.594
That's me on drums.
Leave a message.

07:49.929 --> 07:51.097
Monte, if you're there, pick up.

07:51.264 --> 07:53.808
It's Joe Viola. We need to talk.

07:53.975 --> 07:58.104
All right. I confess.
I gave Joe the number.

07:58.271 --> 07:59.188
Hey, I got some interesting news.

07:59.355 --> 08:01.023
So call me back, all right?

08:02.483 --> 08:04.235
I think you should
hear what he has to say.

08:04.402 --> 08:07.613
And what might be the topic
of that conversation?

08:07.780 --> 08:10.158
Nobody cares
about a writer nobody reads.

08:10.324 --> 08:13.369
Nobody reads you
because you don't write.

08:13.536 --> 08:16.998
Drinking is
a very demanding profession.

08:17.165 --> 08:19.667
And I can't hold down
two jobs at once.

08:19.834 --> 08:22.044
You have always been
your own worst enemy.

08:27.925 --> 08:30.094
What the hell did you
bring that for?

08:30.261 --> 08:32.096
Well...

08:32.263 --> 08:34.890
I wanna remember how proud Mary
was when they gave it to you.

08:35.057 --> 08:36.475
And how you brought it
to the hospital

08:36.642 --> 08:37.809
and hung it on the wall
for her to see

08:37.977 --> 08:39.102
when she opened her eyes.

08:40.270 --> 08:41.272
She was always there for you.

08:41.438 --> 08:43.274
Till she wasn't.

08:44.358 --> 08:46.402
Uncle Monte, she didn't leave you.
She had cancer.

08:46.569 --> 08:47.737
She left me!

08:47.904 --> 08:50.907
Well, there's more to life
than the way you're living it.

08:51.073 --> 08:54.160
Stuff your ideas in the suggestion box
on your way out.

08:54.327 --> 08:56.787
I'll be by to check on you.

08:56.954 --> 08:59.874
And when you do, you'll
find me dead by my own hand,

09:00.041 --> 09:02.752
a smoking Navy Colt Revolver
by my side,

09:02.919 --> 09:05.963
and a note of farewell,
to no one in particular.

09:06.130 --> 09:07.548
Sounds like a plan.

09:09.759 --> 09:12.303
He screams a lot
'cause he's crazy.

09:12.470 --> 09:15.348
I seen him swallow a rat
and then puke it up.

09:15.514 --> 09:17.141
He likes to puke.

09:17.308 --> 09:19.060
He sounds bulimic.

09:19.227 --> 09:21.520
Stay outta my story.

09:21.687 --> 09:24.398
He likes to chew
on spiders and cockroaches,

09:24.565 --> 09:27.235
so he can puke his guts out
all over the floor.

09:27.401 --> 09:29.695
But his favorite...

09:29.862 --> 09:32.406
is big, fat, juicy worms.

09:32.573 --> 09:34.492
Finn, don't scare her.

09:34.659 --> 09:37.161
Shut up, Willow Tree.
I'm looking out for my family.

09:38.287 --> 09:39.914
- Whatever.
- Now...

09:40.081 --> 09:41.332
if he even looks at you,

09:41.499 --> 09:44.835
you just make the sign of the cross,
just like with vampires.

09:45.002 --> 09:46.420
Perfect.

09:46.587 --> 09:48.256
You know what he likes
to do late at night?

09:48.422 --> 09:49.966
What?

09:50.132 --> 09:52.760
He looks for an open window,
sneaks in,

09:52.927 --> 09:55.304
crawls right up
to where you're sleeping,

09:55.471 --> 09:58.349
sticks out his long, slimy tongue,

09:58.516 --> 10:00.434
and licks your feet.

10:00.601 --> 10:02.019
Finn, stop it!

10:02.186 --> 10:05.273
If you catch him licking
your feet, do not,

10:05.439 --> 10:08.567
I repeat
do not open your eyes.

10:08.734 --> 10:10.569
If he sees that you're awake,

10:10.736 --> 10:13.197
he'll bite off a toe
and swallow it whole!

10:13.364 --> 10:14.615
Dinner's ready.

10:14.782 --> 10:17.243
Mother, Finn's scaring Flora again.

10:17.410 --> 10:19.245
She keeps making up stuff
about the man at Dog Dave's,

10:19.412 --> 10:20.538
says he eats worms.

10:20.705 --> 10:22.498
Well, maybe he was hungry.

10:26.460 --> 10:27.461
Poor Don.

10:27.628 --> 10:30.339
Yeah, with all that basketball,
he was in such good shape.

10:31.841 --> 10:36.554
That is why I always refrain
from any form of exercise.

11:04.582 --> 11:05.916
You'll get to see him again.

11:06.083 --> 11:07.918
He'll visit soon.

11:08.085 --> 11:09.754
What's going on?

11:09.920 --> 11:11.714
Flora misses Daddy.

11:13.549 --> 11:17.053
Oh...I know, sweetie.

11:19.555 --> 11:22.016
This has been hard on all of us.

11:22.183 --> 11:24.393
But you know he's gonna visit soon.

11:24.560 --> 11:27.563
Why can't you and Daddy
get married again?

11:28.606 --> 11:32.068
Oh... I wish we could.

11:32.234 --> 11:33.778
You know,
sometimes mommies and daddies

11:33.944 --> 11:35.863
just can't be happy together.

11:36.030 --> 11:39.950
I tried to explain that to her, but...

11:40.117 --> 11:42.703
Are you happy now?

11:44.330 --> 11:46.248
Oh...

11:46.415 --> 11:50.503
I have my three girls...

11:50.669 --> 11:52.505
and that's all I ever want.

12:09.313 --> 12:12.191
Aaaah!

12:14.026 --> 12:15.111
Mmm...

12:15.277 --> 12:17.071
kindred spirit.

12:21.617 --> 12:22.993
Ahh...

12:25.246 --> 12:28.249
Ah, you must be the dog.

12:28.416 --> 12:29.625
Be seated.

12:29.792 --> 12:31.585
We have some things to discuss.

12:33.546 --> 12:37.341
Dog Dave has left you
in my care for the summer.

12:37.508 --> 12:40.136
Right off,
we're gonna change your name.

12:41.762 --> 12:44.765
You are not some
rock 'n' roll icon from Liverpool.

12:44.932 --> 12:47.726
You're a dog,
and you shall be named appropriately.

12:49.019 --> 12:51.772
You will take pride in this name,

12:51.939 --> 12:54.150
and one day, thank me.

12:55.651 --> 12:58.320
I shall call you...

12:58.487 --> 13:00.322
Spot

13:00.489 --> 13:01.824
It's a good name...

13:01.991 --> 13:04.869
even though you don't have spots.

13:05.035 --> 13:06.328
It's not about spots,

13:06.495 --> 13:08.581
as you will come to understand.

13:09.790 --> 13:13.836
Now, I expect to witness
the finer side of your character.

13:14.712 --> 13:17.256
If one of the local bitches is in heat,

13:17.423 --> 13:18.799
she will remain so,

13:18.966 --> 13:22.720
without any assistance on your part
to alleviate her condition.

13:26.640 --> 13:29.393
That's generally
a good way to handle it.

13:29.560 --> 13:31.520
Oh.

13:31.687 --> 13:34.315
One more thing: no farting.

13:42.907 --> 13:44.533
Peace and love.

13:44.700 --> 13:46.660
Not now, Carl.
I've got work to do.

13:46.827 --> 13:48.204
Me, too.

14:00.007 --> 14:01.884
I hope you're ready for me,
Belle Isle,

14:02.051 --> 14:04.261
'cause I'm coming for you.

14:30.579 --> 14:32.665
Is this the Dollar Ride?

14:34.667 --> 14:35.793
Good.

14:35.960 --> 14:40.172
Does your transportation services
accommodate the handicapped?

14:41.882 --> 14:43.592
Excellent, sir,

14:43.759 --> 14:47.346
because if you did not
accommodate the handicapped,

14:47.513 --> 14:50.808
I would sue
your unaccommodating ass.

15:09.118 --> 15:10.578
Buenas dias, seÃƒÂ±oritas.

15:11.579 --> 15:12.580
I don't know about you,

15:12.746 --> 15:15.291
but this music makes me
feel like dancing.

15:28.095 --> 15:29.847
Two Ding Dongs...

15:31.557 --> 15:33.392
Bag of Cheetos...

15:36.937 --> 15:42.109
And a box
of gluten-free Fruity Pebbles.

15:45.487 --> 15:47.197
Will that be all?

15:47.364 --> 15:51.327
Uh, I'll have another bottle
of your finest sour mash whiskey.

15:59.918 --> 16:03.005
That will be $37.42.

16:03.172 --> 16:04.798
Take it out of that.

16:06.091 --> 16:07.760
So, it's Mahmoud, is it?

16:07.926 --> 16:09.428
Yes, sir.

16:09.595 --> 16:12.181
Here is your change.

16:12.348 --> 16:15.142
- Uh-oh.
- What?

16:16.352 --> 16:18.395
Classic check-out stand blunder.

16:18.562 --> 16:19.938
What is?

16:20.105 --> 16:22.316
In a word, Slim Jims.

16:22.483 --> 16:25.611
Isn't that... two words?

16:26.695 --> 16:29.448
You're taking
your eye off the ball, Mahmoud.

16:29.615 --> 16:30.949
What ball?

16:33.661 --> 16:36.288
I realize that it is considered
by many

16:36.455 --> 16:39.416
to be an on-the-way-out kind
of item,

16:39.583 --> 16:43.671
but I believe that
to be a rural myth.

16:43.837 --> 16:45.214
Don't get me wrong.

16:45.381 --> 16:46.840
If you have a hankering
for Slim Jims,

16:47.007 --> 16:48.258
you'll hunt the store over,

16:48.425 --> 16:53.972
but if not, a desperate display
like this improves no one's life.

16:55.140 --> 16:56.517
What do you suggest?

16:56.684 --> 16:58.060
Sunflower seeds.

16:59.061 --> 17:00.062
Just a thought.

17:00.229 --> 17:03.023
- Good day.
- Good day.

17:06.652 --> 17:08.194
Come on.

17:08.362 --> 17:10.155
You're such a good boy.

17:11.990 --> 17:12.991
Hi.

17:14.326 --> 17:15.828
We haven't formally met.

17:15.993 --> 17:17.496
I'm Charlotte O'Neil.

17:17.663 --> 17:21.541
Pleasure, Mrs. O'Neil.
Monte Wildhorn.

17:21.709 --> 17:22.792
I should explain.

17:22.960 --> 17:25.087
I have a rather long-standing
arrangement with Dave,

17:25.253 --> 17:27.423
since he's away
a lot with his band.

17:27.589 --> 17:30.884
And, while he's gone,
I take care of Ringo.

17:31.051 --> 17:33.971
You're not, by any chance,
referring to Spot, are you?

17:34.138 --> 17:36.223
Oh, a new name?

17:37.891 --> 17:39.435
Well, I've known him
since he was a pup.

17:39.601 --> 17:43.355
Well, there's a lot to be said
for enduring associations, Mrs. O'Neil,

17:43.522 --> 17:44.982
but in the future,

17:45.149 --> 17:47.735
I'd appreciate it
if you wouldn't walk my dog.

17:47.901 --> 17:49.236
He's Dave's dog.

17:49.403 --> 17:52.072
I'm not claiming to be
his biological father.

17:52.239 --> 17:54.700
Oh... um...

17:55.617 --> 17:57.411
This is Flora, my youngest.

17:59.371 --> 18:02.332
Well, as long as you think
you can manage, Mr. Wildhorn.

18:02.499 --> 18:05.502
And why wouldn't I be able
to manage, Mrs. O'Neil?

18:05.669 --> 18:07.546
No reason.

18:09.089 --> 18:10.382
Come here.

18:11.425 --> 18:14.136
Oh, um, just so you know.

18:14.303 --> 18:16.054
Uh, Ringo-

18:16.221 --> 18:19.641
Um, sorry, Spot.

18:19.808 --> 18:21.727
He tends to get stiff
in his hindquarters.

18:22.644 --> 18:23.937
He needs daily exercise.

18:24.104 --> 18:25.689
I'll take it under advisement.

18:29.067 --> 18:32.780
Now, I'm willing to meet you halfway.

18:32.946 --> 18:35.783
You miss Dave. I understand that.

18:35.949 --> 18:40.037
But your friend Mrs. O'Neil
had no right to take you for a walk

18:40.204 --> 18:41.914
without asking me first.

18:42.080 --> 18:46.960
In the future, you will politely decline
all such invitations.

18:47.127 --> 18:48.128
Is that clear?

18:51.423 --> 18:54.927
Now that cannot be the response
to every admonishment.

18:57.638 --> 18:59.097
Al Kaiser!

18:59.264 --> 19:00.390
I'm just down the road.

19:00.557 --> 19:02.684
Got the old outboard
in the driveway.

19:02.851 --> 19:04.937
Where are my manners?

19:05.103 --> 19:07.022
Do come in, Mr. Kaiser.

19:07.189 --> 19:09.483
Can I offer you a Ding Dong?

19:09.650 --> 19:10.859
Uh, sorry. I can't stay.

19:11.026 --> 19:13.529
I'm having a memorial for Don
at my house.

19:13.695 --> 19:15.823
Ah, the basketball aficionado.

19:15.989 --> 19:17.449
Yes. It was quite a shock.

19:17.616 --> 19:19.326
Yeah, well, not to me.

19:19.493 --> 19:21.787
Well, I hope you can make it.

19:21.954 --> 19:23.580
Uh, I didn't know the man.

19:23.747 --> 19:25.123
Everybody's bringing something.

19:25.290 --> 19:27.292
You know, potluck.
See you around 5:00.

19:27.459 --> 19:29.169
I didn't know the man.

19:29.336 --> 19:30.587
See you then!

19:33.173 --> 19:35.717
Did I miss Daddy's call?

19:35.884 --> 19:38.971
Daddy will call you
as soon as he has time, Willow Tree.

19:39.137 --> 19:41.306
Daddy promised
to help me finish my raft.

19:41.473 --> 19:43.600
I'm going to the island this summer.

19:43.767 --> 19:45.686
What's so important
about that stupid island, anyway?

19:46.979 --> 19:48.105
That's where the magic is.

19:48.272 --> 19:49.606
You're delusional.

19:49.773 --> 19:50.774
Willow.

19:52.025 --> 19:53.861
I just don't understand
why I couldn't have stayed with Dad.

19:54.778 --> 19:56.613
I'd like the two of you
to take the salad

19:56.780 --> 19:57.865
down the block to Don's memorial.

19:58.031 --> 19:59.700
I'm busy.

19:59.867 --> 20:01.535
I'll go, Mama.

20:01.702 --> 20:03.120
Thank you, Finn.

20:03.287 --> 20:04.997
What do I do?

20:05.163 --> 20:08.250
You offer our family's condolences,

20:08.417 --> 20:10.127
and then you leave the salad
and come straight home.

20:10.294 --> 20:11.837
What's condolences?

20:12.004 --> 20:15.757
You say, "We're very sorry
that Don has passed,

20:15.924 --> 20:17.301
but now he's with all of us."

20:17.467 --> 20:19.094
He is?

20:19.261 --> 20:21.597
Just drop off the salad
and look sad.

20:22.890 --> 20:24.558
Ah, I'm so glad you made it.

20:25.726 --> 20:26.685
I brought you Cheetos.

20:26.852 --> 20:28.645
Nice touch. Welcome.

20:30.314 --> 20:31.607
Uh, thanks.

20:31.773 --> 20:34.401
There's plenty to eat,
and the beer is on ice,

20:34.568 --> 20:36.361
just the way Don
would have wanted.

20:37.946 --> 20:39.531
A lot of nice people here.

20:39.698 --> 20:41.158
I think you'll like everybody.

20:43.285 --> 20:47.039
I must say,
I'm a big admirer of your work.

20:47.205 --> 20:48.874
Thank you.

20:49.041 --> 20:50.709
I haven't been
a dog-sitter for very long.

20:50.876 --> 20:53.587
No, I'm talking about
those Western novels you write.

20:53.754 --> 20:57.382
I've got a copy of "Showdown
at Red Rock" around somewhere.

20:58.300 --> 20:59.551
It's been out of print for years.

20:59.718 --> 21:01.553
Uh, you mentioned beer?

21:01.720 --> 21:03.055
Beer. Indeed I did.

21:05.098 --> 21:06.266
Hi, Finn.

21:06.433 --> 21:09.102
Sorry Don died. Here's a salad.

21:09.269 --> 21:10.646
Don would've appreciated that.

21:10.812 --> 21:12.397
And thank your mother for me.

21:12.564 --> 21:14.274
You can add the salad to that table,

21:14.441 --> 21:17.069
and be an angel
and drop that off, too.

21:17.235 --> 21:19.696
One of the O'Neil girls.

21:19.863 --> 21:21.323
Sweet kids.

21:21.490 --> 21:25.953
Monte Wildhorn, may I present
Miss Finnegan O'Neil of Belle Isle.

21:27.245 --> 21:28.747
Pleased to make
your acquaintance.

21:28.914 --> 21:30.457
Can I get more beer?

21:30.624 --> 21:32.084
Ah.

21:32.250 --> 21:34.044
Mr. Wildhorn
writes about cowboys

21:34.211 --> 21:35.337
in the Wild West.

21:35.504 --> 21:37.589
Boy, I'll say one thing.

21:37.756 --> 21:40.926
That Jubal McLaws
sure is quick on the draw.

21:41.093 --> 21:44.137
Many cross his path.
Few live to tell about it.

21:44.304 --> 21:45.639
Now, that's right,

21:45.806 --> 21:47.140
like when Jubal had that shootout

21:47.307 --> 21:49.726
with Deadshot Jim Watson
of Albuquerque.

21:49.893 --> 21:51.269
Whoo!

21:51.436 --> 21:53.188
Say, if I could find my copy

21:53.355 --> 21:55.357
of "Showdown at Red Rock,"
would you sign it for me?

21:55.524 --> 21:57.359
I would not, Mr. Kaiser.

21:57.526 --> 22:01.446
I've always resisted becoming
part of the cult of celebrity.

22:01.613 --> 22:03.740
However...

22:03.907 --> 22:05.117
I will accept another beer.

22:05.283 --> 22:08.286
Ah! All right. I respect that.

22:18.171 --> 22:20.007
I'm not really from Belle Isle.

22:20.173 --> 22:22.426
We only come here for the summers.

22:23.760 --> 22:24.761
Is that so?

22:25.804 --> 22:26.972
I live in Manhattan.

22:28.724 --> 22:30.809
At least, I used to.

22:30.976 --> 22:32.227
My dad and mom are
getting divorced,

22:32.394 --> 22:34.896
so now my mom says
we have to live here all the time.

22:35.063 --> 22:36.064
Hmm...

22:38.025 --> 22:40.068
How come your mom let you
come to an event like this

22:40.235 --> 22:41.611
all by your lonesome?

22:41.778 --> 22:43.655
'Cause I'm 91/2 years old.

22:43.822 --> 22:46.742
- Hmm, that's pretty old.
- I know.

22:46.908 --> 22:49.077
My mom even lets me have
my own pocket knife.

22:49.244 --> 22:51.288
You don't have no pocket knife.

22:51.455 --> 22:53.957
- I do so.
- Do not.

22:58.962 --> 23:00.464
My! my'

23:01.590 --> 23:04.301
Look at that.

23:04.468 --> 23:08.430
That must be about the finest
pocket knife I have ever seen.

23:10.098 --> 23:12.476
You know, you can tell
a lot about a person's character

23:12.642 --> 23:14.436
by the condition
of their pocket knife.

23:14.603 --> 23:17.522
I'd say you were fearless.

23:27.532 --> 23:28.784
What's his problem?

23:28.950 --> 23:31.703
Oh, he's just being Carl Loop.

23:31.870 --> 23:34.539
Willow says he's retarded,
but Mom says he's special.

23:34.706 --> 23:38.543
Hmm. Well, whatever he is,
he's a fine dancer.

23:40.587 --> 23:41.797
You write stories?

23:44.216 --> 23:45.634
I used to.

23:45.801 --> 23:48.762
My favorite story is
about aliens from outer space.

23:48.929 --> 23:52.140
Mm. Extraterrestrials
have their place,

23:52.307 --> 23:54.518
and I've met a few,

23:54.684 --> 23:57.854
but you don't have to leave this planet
to tell a good story.

24:00.190 --> 24:01.441
How...

24:01.608 --> 24:02.484
How do you make 'em up?

24:02.651 --> 24:04.402
Imagination.

24:04.569 --> 24:08.198
The most powerful force
ever made available to humankind.

24:10.325 --> 24:11.493
Here you go.

24:14.287 --> 24:16.289
Hey, Monte, I'm no professional,

24:16.456 --> 24:19.292
but I wrote this speech for Don,

24:19.459 --> 24:21.795
but I'll never be able
to get through it.

24:21.962 --> 24:23.380
I was gonna ask you
to read it out loud.

24:23.547 --> 24:25.298
I've always had a disdain

24:25.465 --> 24:28.301
for public displays
of sentimentality, Mr. Kaiser.

24:28.468 --> 24:31.054
Hey, who doesn't?
Don would be so pleased.

24:31.221 --> 24:32.347
Didn't know the man.

24:32.514 --> 24:36.143
Monte has something
he wants to read to us about Don.

24:36.309 --> 24:39.354
So, if you would, just step outside
as quickly as you can.

24:39.521 --> 24:42.232
Thank you so much.
He's very excited about this.

24:42.399 --> 24:44.317
Hi, nice to see you.
I didn't get a chance to say hello.

24:44.484 --> 24:46.778
Oh, I didn't know you were here.
Hi. Welcome.

24:46.945 --> 24:49.322
All right, people,
this is a sad and happy occasion.

24:49.489 --> 24:50.824
Thanks for coming here.

24:50.991 --> 24:54.536
Everybody please say hello
to Monte Wildhorn.

25:09.801 --> 25:11.720
"'Jesus H. Christ."'

25:14.014 --> 25:16.516
"According to our friend Karen Loop,

25:16.683 --> 25:18.518
"that's how most people
around the lake reacted

25:18.685 --> 25:21.521
"when they heard the news
of Don's passing.

25:22.480 --> 25:24.316
"That's not such a bad obit.

25:24.482 --> 25:27.819
"Concise. Even rather eloquent.

25:27.986 --> 25:30.363
"Don would've approved.

25:31.364 --> 25:33.366
"There are people in life you avoid,

25:33.533 --> 25:36.328
"and others you go
out of your way to bump into.

25:36.494 --> 25:39.706
"Don had that bump-into quality
about him,

25:39.873 --> 25:44.127
"which is why nobody ever ducked
when they saw Don coming.

25:44.294 --> 25:47.756
"He took beer very seriously.

25:47.923 --> 25:50.467
"It had to be Pabst Blue Ribbon.

25:50.634 --> 25:53.261
"If it couldn't be Pabst,

25:53.428 --> 25:54.846
"it at least had to be cold.

25:56.389 --> 25:57.682
"As good as Don was,

25:57.849 --> 26:02.270
"I think he only got better
once he found the Belle.

26:02.437 --> 26:05.565
"There just might be something special
about this place.

26:05.732 --> 26:09.069
"It don't happen too often,
but sometimes

26:09.236 --> 26:12.864
"we do bring out
the best in each other.

26:13.031 --> 26:15.492
"We'll miss you, Don.

26:16.910 --> 26:18.161
Watch over us."

26:22.332 --> 26:25.335
Don't change a word.

26:25.502 --> 26:28.880
The man at Dog Dave's writes stories
about cowboys in the Wild West.

26:29.047 --> 26:30.674
He does?

26:30.840 --> 26:32.884
Yeah... not about space aliens.

26:33.051 --> 26:34.344
No aliens?

26:34.511 --> 26:36.221
Mm-mm.

26:36.388 --> 26:37.973
You know, you don't have
to go off this planet

26:38.139 --> 26:39.432
to tell a good story.

26:41.226 --> 26:43.687
Mama, when we get home,
can I work on my raft?

26:43.853 --> 26:46.856
No, you promised
you'd clean your room.

26:47.023 --> 26:49.192
Well, Jesus H. Christ!

26:50.277 --> 26:51.569
Ms. O'Neil.

26:52.445 --> 26:55.198
That is a most unbecoming
use of language.

26:55.365 --> 26:57.200
Mr. Kaiser wrote it about Don.

26:57.367 --> 26:59.244
You're not Mr. Kaiser.

27:00.495 --> 27:01.413
Am I in trouble?

27:01.579 --> 27:03.248
You most certainly are,

27:03.415 --> 27:06.167
and your punishment
is to memorize three new words

27:06.334 --> 27:08.962
and define them for me
by dinner Friday.

27:09.129 --> 27:10.964
And I expect to be impressed.

27:11.131 --> 27:12.799
You will be. I promise.

27:14.592 --> 27:15.677
Hmm.

27:23.893 --> 27:25.937
Who does your taxes?

27:26.104 --> 27:29.357
I am currently
without an accountant, Mrs. Loop.

27:29.524 --> 27:31.151
Karen.

27:31.318 --> 27:35.363
I have aspired for years
to someday attain the poverty level.

27:35.530 --> 27:37.949
Having recently achieved my goal,

27:38.116 --> 27:41.202
I'm not in need
of such services just now.

27:41.369 --> 27:44.080
I always get my clients a big refund.

27:45.623 --> 27:48.710
You have a positive outlook
on life, Karen.

27:48.877 --> 27:50.587
This is our place.

27:50.754 --> 27:52.756
Thanks for walking us home.

27:53.715 --> 27:55.800
You and the boy
on your own out here?

27:55.967 --> 27:58.511
My old man took off
after Carl was born.

27:58.678 --> 28:00.555
I'm sorry to hear that.

28:01.765 --> 28:03.892
It's no great loss.

28:04.059 --> 28:07.103
Well, if there's anything I can do.

28:08.480 --> 28:10.398
Carl never gets any phone calls.

28:10.565 --> 28:13.985
It would be nice for him
to get a phone call.

28:14.152 --> 28:15.612
Here's my business card.

28:18.573 --> 28:20.533
It's got our home number on it.

28:21.701 --> 28:23.620
Telephone's a damn nuisance.

28:23.787 --> 28:26.581
Ain't got no use for it.

28:26.748 --> 28:30.043
And them people on cell phones
oughta be shot dead in the street.

28:38.718 --> 28:40.136
Hey, Carl.

28:47.352 --> 28:51.272
How'd you like to be
my faithful sidekick, Diego Santana?

28:51.439 --> 28:55.026
Wanted for train robbery
in three territories.

28:55.193 --> 28:56.194
I am?

28:57.570 --> 29:00.323
Railroad Pinkertons
are hot on our trail, amigo.

29:02.325 --> 29:03.576
How do I be Diego?

29:03.743 --> 29:07.122
Well, for starters,
lose the bunny hop.

29:34.524 --> 29:37.360
Yeah, I'm touched by your concern.

29:37.527 --> 29:39.362
Thank God I'm still drinking.

29:39.529 --> 29:41.823
Saves me the humiliation
of falling off the wagon.

29:41.990 --> 29:43.950
I need three words.

29:45.660 --> 29:46.744
Have we met?

29:51.791 --> 29:53.626
Did I extend an invitation?

29:53.793 --> 29:55.170
No.

29:55.336 --> 29:57.380
I didn't think so.

29:59.007 --> 30:01.676
You know a lot of good words
'cause you write stories.

30:01.843 --> 30:03.887
I need three good ones
for my mom.

30:04.053 --> 30:06.431
I lost all my good words
a long time ago.

30:06.598 --> 30:09.184
What about imagination?

30:09.350 --> 30:10.727
Should I use that one?

30:10.894 --> 30:13.605
Last time I checked,
it was still available.

30:15.190 --> 30:16.357
Can you teach me
to write stories?

30:18.401 --> 30:20.028
You are awfully demanding.

30:21.863 --> 30:23.698
All right, Spot.

30:23.865 --> 30:26.075
Time for our morning dose.

30:33.124 --> 30:34.501
There you go.

30:35.585 --> 30:37.420
That's a good boy.

30:37.587 --> 30:39.631
How come you give him aspirin?

30:39.797 --> 30:42.926
Uh, it seems Spot has developed
some stiffness in his hindquarters.

30:44.302 --> 30:45.803
And aspirin helps that.

30:48.139 --> 30:49.224
I'm not exactly sure,

30:49.390 --> 30:53.269
but long as he thinks it does,
that's half the battle, isn't it?

30:57.857 --> 31:00.151
How come you don't
write on a computer?

31:03.071 --> 31:07.033
I'm gonna answer your question
in return for blessed silence.

31:12.872 --> 31:14.249
Look at that machine.

31:15.500 --> 31:19.337
I like that you have to write
a bit slower on a manual.

31:19.504 --> 31:21.548
I like the way it sounds.

31:22.423 --> 31:26.886
I like the way the letters
bite into the paper.

31:28.680 --> 31:30.932
I like that you can feel
there's a genuine human being

31:31.099 --> 31:32.850
doing the work- Hands off.

31:37.397 --> 31:38.648
What's that?

31:40.441 --> 31:42.694
Buckaroo. What's a Buckaroo?

31:42.860 --> 31:45.738
It's an award for literary excellence.

31:47.073 --> 31:49.617
"Western Authors Academy.
Best Western novel.

31:49.784 --> 31:51.119
"'The Saga of Jubal McLaws.'

31:51.286 --> 31:54.414
Presented to Monte Wildhorn. 1975."

31:54.581 --> 31:57.375
Cool. Did you give
a speech when you won?

31:57.542 --> 31:59.711
Yes, ma'am, I did.

31:59.877 --> 32:01.713
Who'd you thank?

32:01.879 --> 32:04.090
My one true love
and three bartenders.

32:07.719 --> 32:08.970
How come you can't walk?

32:11.723 --> 32:12.932
Who says I can't?

32:16.603 --> 32:17.812
Why are you in a wheelchair?

32:19.397 --> 32:20.690
Can you keep a secret?

32:24.360 --> 32:25.653
Even if they torture me.

32:28.072 --> 32:29.699
I'm attempting to defraud

32:29.866 --> 32:31.909
the Liberty Mutual
insurance conglomerate

32:32.076 --> 32:33.494
out of a million dollars.

32:35.079 --> 32:36.122
What's defraud?

32:36.289 --> 32:39.834
Cheat, snooker, fleece, bamboozle.

32:41.169 --> 32:42.795
So you can walk?

32:42.962 --> 32:44.881
I can run.

32:46.299 --> 32:47.508
But I have to be careful.

32:47.675 --> 32:48.885
If those Liberty Mutual boys
catch me

32:49.052 --> 32:52.555
while I'm out for a quick jog,
it's all over.

32:52.722 --> 32:54.557
I can kiss that million bucks
good-bye

32:54.724 --> 32:56.476
and say hello
to Yuma State Prison.

32:56.643 --> 32:58.394
You could go to jail?

32:58.561 --> 33:00.063
Oh, yeah.

33:00.229 --> 33:01.856
But what's jail?

33:02.982 --> 33:06.569
As John Milton once said,
"The mind is its own place."

33:13.868 --> 33:16.496
So what do those, uh,
Liberty Mutual boys look like?

33:18.122 --> 33:19.666
Suits.

33:19.832 --> 33:20.958
Suits, huh?

33:22.418 --> 33:23.628
I'll make you a deal.

33:25.380 --> 33:28.299
You teach me about imagination,

33:28.466 --> 33:30.176
and I'll keep a lookout.

33:32.637 --> 33:34.389
That might be asking too much.

33:35.306 --> 33:38.685
I can pay you,
$34 and 18 cents in cash.

33:38.851 --> 33:40.353
I saved it up.

33:42.146 --> 33:44.565
And what exactly would
you want for your money?

33:45.608 --> 33:47.068
I wanna know
where stories come from.

33:47.235 --> 33:49.696
Ah...

33:49.862 --> 33:50.905
you want a mentor.

33:52.281 --> 33:53.783
A what?

33:53.950 --> 33:57.954
You absolutely sure you want to set foot
into such a mysterious realm?

33:58.121 --> 33:59.288
I'm sure.

33:59.455 --> 34:00.540
You may get lost in there

34:00.707 --> 34:02.333
and not be able to find
your way back.

34:03.501 --> 34:05.044
You said I'm fearless.

34:05.920 --> 34:07.171
That I did.

34:09.005 --> 34:11.134
- So, we got a deal?
- My word is my bond.

34:11.300 --> 34:13.761
Great.
So, when's my first lesson?

34:13.928 --> 34:15.138
You just had it.

34:18.014 --> 34:19.684
Huh?

34:19.851 --> 34:21.436
I can't walk.

34:24.272 --> 34:25.313
What do you mean?

34:25.481 --> 34:29.025
I mean, I can't walk.
I just made up a story.

34:29.193 --> 34:30.527
Really?

34:30.695 --> 34:31.904
Really.

34:33.406 --> 34:34.489
You're kind of a jerk.

34:35.658 --> 34:36.701
Did you picture me running?

34:39.120 --> 34:40.455
Yeah.

34:40.621 --> 34:43.498
Did you see those men
in suits coming after me?

34:44.833 --> 34:45.877
Yeah.

34:46.043 --> 34:48.295
So did I.

34:48.463 --> 34:49.839
That's imagination.

34:53.509 --> 34:55.303
- But you-
- Class dismissed.

34:55.469 --> 34:58.222
We'll have
another lesson tomorrow.

34:58.389 --> 35:00.683
Okay.

35:05.480 --> 35:06.773
I still think you're a jerk.

35:08.691 --> 35:09.734
Fair enough.

35:28.711 --> 35:30.129
"Jubal McLaws."

35:33.299 --> 35:34.926
You got my last Wildhorn there.

35:35.092 --> 35:36.886
It's gonna run you 35 cents.

35:37.053 --> 35:39.305
It's discounted because
it's missing the last page.

35:39.472 --> 35:42.058
Somebody tore it
right out of the book.

35:42.225 --> 35:43.768
That's okay. I'll take it.

35:49.774 --> 35:52.652
What would you say if we extend
a dinner invitation this evening

35:52.819 --> 35:54.153
to our local author?

35:54.320 --> 35:56.322
- Yes, Mama, please!
- Oh, God.

35:56.489 --> 35:58.950
But he only eats worms, Mama.

35:59.116 --> 36:01.786
Flora, Finn was just teasing you.

36:01.953 --> 36:03.246
I think it would be good
for you ladies

36:03.412 --> 36:04.831
to experience a literary man.

36:04.997 --> 36:06.332
How do you expect that to happen?

36:06.499 --> 36:07.500
He needs a ramp.

36:07.667 --> 36:09.043
We're not exactly handicap-friendly.

36:09.210 --> 36:10.253
I'll build it.

36:10.419 --> 36:12.672
Thank you, Finn.
Let me know if I can help.

36:12.839 --> 36:15.216
It's Dad.

36:15.383 --> 36:17.009
Maybe he'd like
to come to dinner tonight.

36:17.176 --> 36:18.970
I wanna talk.

36:19.136 --> 36:20.930
After me. Hi, Dad.

36:22.431 --> 36:23.808
When am I gonna see you?

36:23.975 --> 36:25.560
Dad's coming the weekend
of Flora's birthday.

36:25.726 --> 36:26.978
Tell Dad he has to finish my raft.

36:27.144 --> 36:28.271
When's the weekend
of my birthday, Mama?

36:28.437 --> 36:29.605
It's in August, baby.

36:29.772 --> 36:31.607
- When's that?
- Soon.

36:31.774 --> 36:33.109
Tell your father I'll call him back.

36:33.276 --> 36:34.986
No, he wants to talk to you now.

36:35.152 --> 36:37.113
Not while I'm driving.

36:37.280 --> 36:41.200
Today, I will introduce
our summer athletic program.

36:42.410 --> 36:44.245
The traditional game of fetch,

36:44.412 --> 36:47.206
which I'm sure
you are familiar with.

36:47.373 --> 36:51.043
I hold in my hand
a Major League baseball.

36:52.044 --> 36:53.629
You might be interested to know, sir,

36:53.796 --> 36:56.716
that before I lost
the use of my left arm,

36:56.883 --> 36:59.927
I was known to possess
a mean cut fast ball.

37:00.094 --> 37:03.264
Therefore, my affinity
for this wondrous sphere

37:03.431 --> 37:05.474
should come as no surprise.

37:07.310 --> 37:08.728
Fetch.

37:11.939 --> 37:14.400
I see the concept
of fetch eludes you.

37:15.860 --> 37:17.612
I blame Dave for that.

37:17.778 --> 37:21.240
For the record,
this will be the last time

37:21.407 --> 37:23.367
I fetch the ball.

37:25.536 --> 37:26.621
When do we start?

37:31.125 --> 37:32.043
Start what?

37:32.209 --> 37:33.336
My imagination.

37:33.502 --> 37:35.630
$34 and 18 cents. It's all there.

37:35.796 --> 37:37.465
Uh, yeah.

37:39.425 --> 37:42.011
Well, no time like the present.

37:44.263 --> 37:45.681
What do you see up this street?

37:48.559 --> 37:50.561
Nothing. Just a street.

37:52.730 --> 37:55.107
Okay, try telling me
what you don't see.

37:56.400 --> 37:57.360
Huh?

37:57.526 --> 37:59.570
What don't you see?

37:59.737 --> 38:00.655
I just told you.

38:00.821 --> 38:02.949
Work with me.

38:03.115 --> 38:04.575
See with your mind's eye.

38:08.704 --> 38:11.290
Well, I sure don't see
no cowboy riding a horse.

38:11.457 --> 38:12.667
Well, if you're
looking for Jubal,

38:12.833 --> 38:13.918
you'll never see him.

38:14.085 --> 38:15.252
Why not?

38:15.419 --> 38:17.129
Gotta look for your own things.

38:17.296 --> 38:18.756
How do I do that?

38:20.466 --> 38:21.467
Keep lookin'.

38:26.472 --> 38:27.974
I Paid you.

38:28.140 --> 38:31.352
There's a mystery
to making things up, kiddo,

38:31.519 --> 38:33.688
and life offers no guarantees.

38:34.689 --> 38:35.773
You got till the end of the summer,

38:35.940 --> 38:37.233
or I want my money back.

38:38.693 --> 38:41.737
Well, I've always done my best
when working under a deadline.

38:48.411 --> 38:50.538
You're invited over for dinner tonight,
precisely at seven.

38:54.417 --> 38:56.085
Oh, dear.

39:01.966 --> 39:03.634
Hey, Finn.

39:03.801 --> 39:04.802
Oh, hi, Carl.

39:07.346 --> 39:09.265
I'm not Carl.

39:09.432 --> 39:11.267
I'm Diego Santana...

39:12.518 --> 39:14.603
train robber and faithful sidekick.

39:14.770 --> 39:16.147
Whose sidekick?

39:16.313 --> 39:17.940
The man at Dog Dave's.

39:19.442 --> 39:20.651
What are you doing?

39:20.818 --> 39:22.111
Building a ramp for Monte.

39:22.278 --> 39:23.529
Who's Monte?

39:23.696 --> 39:25.072
The man at Dog Dave's.

39:25.239 --> 39:26.782
I'm his sidekick.

39:26.949 --> 39:29.201
Good, then you can
help me build this.

39:29.368 --> 39:30.703
I can do that.

39:33.039 --> 39:34.915
Hey, Uncle Monte. It's Henry.

39:35.082 --> 39:37.001
Just calling to see
how that whole killing yourself thing

39:37.168 --> 39:38.461
is working out for you.

39:42.214 --> 39:44.467
It's temporarily postponed.

39:44.633 --> 39:46.844
Oh. Well, the summer's young.

39:47.011 --> 39:50.598
An invitation has been
extended for dinner.

39:50.765 --> 39:52.433
Next door.

39:52.600 --> 39:54.602
I've accepted.

39:54.769 --> 39:56.353
What, the beautiful woman
from the roof?

39:56.520 --> 39:59.023
- The very same.
- Well, that's great!

39:59.190 --> 40:00.066
You know what to do?

40:00.232 --> 40:01.192
Eat?

40:01.358 --> 40:02.902
Just bring her something nice.

40:03.069 --> 40:03.903
Pick some flowers.

40:04.070 --> 40:05.404
Too conventional.

40:05.571 --> 40:07.281
Well, you'll figure it out.

40:07.448 --> 40:10.117
I'm guessing you didn't
call Joe Viola back.

40:10.284 --> 40:11.535
Correct.

40:11.702 --> 40:13.370
Why don't you just listen
to what he has to say?

40:13.537 --> 40:14.914
Not interested.

40:15.081 --> 40:16.624
You take care of yourself,
Uncle Monte.

40:16.791 --> 40:18.375
Not interested.

40:18.542 --> 40:20.127
Okay, bye, Uncle Monte.

40:20.294 --> 40:22.797
Bye, young Hen")!-

40:58.415 --> 41:00.709
Oh.

41:00.876 --> 41:03.879
As I recall,
it's improper to arrive empty-handed.

41:04.046 --> 41:05.256
A mirror?

41:05.422 --> 41:07.967
I figure a house full of ladies
could always use another one.

41:08.884 --> 41:11.428
Well, thank you.
This is quite a unique gift.

41:13.806 --> 41:14.640
Do come in, Mr. Wildhorn.

41:14.807 --> 41:15.933
Thank you.

41:17.184 --> 41:19.186
I didn't think you'd mind
if Spot came along.

41:19.353 --> 41:20.563
He's always welcome.

41:21.397 --> 41:23.315
May I take your hat,
Mr. Wildhorn?

41:23.482 --> 41:24.817
Why, thank you, Flora.

41:25.860 --> 41:28.529
Ladies, please see
Mr. Wildhorn to the table.

41:28.696 --> 41:30.072
I hope you like chicken.

41:30.239 --> 41:32.199
Never had a chicken
do me wrong.

41:32.366 --> 41:34.201
Finn tells me you write books.

41:34.368 --> 41:36.203
It's been a while.

41:36.370 --> 41:38.747
No texting at the table,
okay, Willow?

41:38.914 --> 41:41.584
I always felt like a book is...

41:41.750 --> 41:44.253
a friend that does
what no friend can do.

41:44.420 --> 41:46.589
Stay quiet when you wanna think.

41:48.966 --> 41:51.302
Would you care
for some wine, Mr. Wildhorn?

41:51.468 --> 41:54.263
Ordinarily, I don't indulge,
Mrs. O'Neil,

41:54.430 --> 41:57.474
but since I may
work my way up to a toast,

41:57.641 --> 42:01.061
I think maybe a glass of wine
might be in order, just this once.

42:01.228 --> 42:03.564
You'll have to excuse me
if I don't get up.

42:04.940 --> 42:06.567
I started reading
"The Saga of Jubal McLaws."

42:06.734 --> 42:08.861
It's really cool.

42:09.028 --> 42:11.280
Oh, one of my kinder reviews.

42:11.447 --> 42:12.865
I got it cheap 'cause
it didn't have the last page.

42:13.032 --> 42:15.242
Oh, you're not missing much.

42:15.409 --> 42:17.661
I always meant to rewrite
that page anyway.

42:17.828 --> 42:19.496
Are all your books about the West?

42:19.663 --> 42:21.290
Pretty much.

42:21.457 --> 42:24.543
I love horses.
I used to ride when I was a child.

42:25.419 --> 42:26.587
Can you pass the gravy, please?

42:26.754 --> 42:28.339
Good horse is half the dream.

42:29.548 --> 42:31.258
What's the other half?

42:31.425 --> 42:33.552
Your knight in shining armor.

42:35.763 --> 42:37.598
Do you know any stories
about elephants?

42:38.599 --> 42:39.767
Flora loves elephants.

42:39.934 --> 42:44.146
I'm afraid I'm not a reliable source
when it comes to pachyderms.

42:45.606 --> 42:47.358
How did Jubal come to be
the man who rides alone?

42:48.776 --> 42:50.319
He didn't have much choice.

42:52.696 --> 42:54.531
The end of the Civil War,

42:54.698 --> 42:57.952
Jubal rode home to Texas
to be reunited with his family.

42:58.118 --> 43:00.663
It took a good many years
before he could bring himself

43:00.829 --> 43:02.831
to mention the ghastly sight
that awaited him

43:02.998 --> 43:04.708
when he arrived back
at the old homestead.

43:04.875 --> 43:06.085
What happened?

43:06.252 --> 43:10.047
Comanche raiding party.

43:10.214 --> 43:11.924
His papa's horse
had been gut shot,

43:12.091 --> 43:14.718
pin-cushioned with arrows
and left to suffer.

43:15.761 --> 43:17.304
He found his beloved mother

43:17.471 --> 43:20.266
outside the cabin,
her head nearly severed,

43:20.432 --> 43:22.226
her stomach ripped open.

43:22.393 --> 43:24.019
Remember, girls, it's just a story.

43:24.186 --> 43:25.479
Just a story?

43:25.646 --> 43:28.107
I only meant
that it didn't really happen.

43:30.067 --> 43:31.360
It happened to Jubal.

43:34.697 --> 43:36.657
Mashed potatoes, Mr. Wildhorn?

43:40.244 --> 43:42.496
Sweet old place
you've got here, Mrs. O'Neil.

43:42.663 --> 43:46.166
Belonged to my grandparents,
then my mom.

43:46.333 --> 43:47.626
I spent my summers here
growing up.

43:47.793 --> 43:49.670
Well, I prefer growing up in the city,

43:49.837 --> 43:51.880
but instead,
I'm being held prisoner here.

43:54.758 --> 43:56.468
Are you ready
for my three words, Mama?

43:57.761 --> 43:58.846
If you're prepared.

43:59.013 --> 44:00.764
Can I be excused?

44:00.931 --> 44:03.225
You may not. Go ahead, Finn.

44:03.392 --> 44:06.020
One, imagination:

44:06.186 --> 44:08.022
the process of forming
a mental image of something

44:08.188 --> 44:11.358
never before perceived
by the imaginer in reality.

44:12.735 --> 44:14.153
Besides being
the most powerful force

44:14.320 --> 44:16.572
ever made available for humankind.

44:16.739 --> 44:18.324
Two,

44:18.490 --> 44:20.326
bamboozle:

44:20.492 --> 44:22.786
to deceive or get the better
of somebody by trickery.

44:22.953 --> 44:25.456
Cheat, fleece, or snooker.

44:26.665 --> 44:28.625
And your third word?

44:28.792 --> 44:31.045
Mentor:

44:31.211 --> 44:35.174
a trusted counselor
or guide, tutor or coach.

44:37.176 --> 44:38.427
Interesting choices.

44:40.220 --> 44:41.680
I'm gonna be seven this summer.

44:41.847 --> 44:42.973
You can come to my party.

44:43.140 --> 44:44.767
Flora, he doesn't want to.

44:44.933 --> 44:47.227
Finnegan. It's August 15th.

44:47.394 --> 44:48.645
And you're under no obligation.

44:48.812 --> 44:51.231
To the contrary.

44:51.398 --> 44:55.486
I greatly appreciate being included
in your celebratory plans

44:55.652 --> 44:59.031
and I will be sure to mark
that special day on my calendar.

45:01.825 --> 45:03.494
Who plays the piano?

45:03.660 --> 45:06.372
I've been trying to teach
these three, to no avail.

45:06.538 --> 45:08.624
Do you appreciate music,
Mr. Wildhorn?

45:08.791 --> 45:11.460
Oh, yes, ma'am, I do.

45:11.627 --> 45:15.339
In my younger days, I was
often complimented for my voice.

45:16.298 --> 45:17.466
Would you like to sing for us?

45:18.967 --> 45:20.511
It's the least I can do.

45:20.677 --> 45:21.970
Now may I be excused?

45:22.137 --> 45:25.391
No. Mr. Wildhorn's
going to favor us with a song.

45:26.683 --> 45:29.395
Oh, a captain born in Halifax

45:29.561 --> 45:31.397
Who dwelt in country quarters

45:31.563 --> 45:33.273
Seduced a maid
who hanged herself

45:33.440 --> 45:34.900
Next morning in her garters

45:35.067 --> 45:36.235
I don't think I know that one.

45:36.402 --> 45:39.655
Well, okay...
play something you do know.

45:41.782 --> 45:44.868
Um, well...

45:45.035 --> 45:46.870
it's not a song, exactly.

45:47.037 --> 45:50.165
But... here goes.

46:27.911 --> 46:31.540
Mmm, I would leave
all my windows open

46:31.707 --> 46:33.709
to hear that kind of playing.

46:34.918 --> 46:38.088
That would be
one of my kinder reviews.

46:41.341 --> 46:43.302
He's telling me
I've outstayed my welcome.

46:43.469 --> 46:46.472
All right, girls.
Let's say good night to Mr. Wildhorn.

46:48.223 --> 46:50.100
Good night, Monte.

46:50.267 --> 46:51.435
Oh, good night, Flora.

46:53.729 --> 46:55.105
I'll be ready first thing
in the morning.

46:56.356 --> 46:57.441
For what?

46:57.608 --> 46:59.985
- You know.
- Oh, oh, oh. All right.

47:00.152 --> 47:01.945
Yeah, thanks for the reminder.

47:03.197 --> 47:05.866
Girls, you can clear the table.
You too, Willow.

47:09.036 --> 47:10.829
Mrs. O'Neil,

47:10.996 --> 47:13.707
I want to thank you
for a very lovely evening.

47:13.874 --> 47:15.375
I don't believe I have ever

47:15.542 --> 47:19.254
heard Beethoven's Pathetique Sonata
played with such affection.

47:19.421 --> 47:21.006
You know the piece.

47:21.173 --> 47:23.675
Well, when I was writing,

47:23.842 --> 47:25.844
I listened to all kinds of music.

47:30.349 --> 47:31.892
Mr. Wild horn.

47:36.271 --> 47:37.898
Why did you stop writing?

47:40.651 --> 47:42.861
Same reason I gave up religion.

47:44.905 --> 47:47.491
God confided in me
that he's an atheist.

47:49.701 --> 47:52.454
Did your Jubal McLaws
ever love a woman?

47:54.706 --> 47:56.583
Well, Jubal always got the girl,

47:56.750 --> 47:59.878
but he only fell in love once.

48:00.837 --> 48:03.048
That's more than some.

48:03.215 --> 48:05.467
Did they live happily ever after?

48:05.634 --> 48:07.261
No.

48:07.427 --> 48:11.723
He lost her to the influenza
in "Cattle Wars."

48:11.890 --> 48:14.768
And he never fell in love after that?

48:17.020 --> 48:18.313
How could he?

48:22.734 --> 48:26.071
I think Jubal has
quite a hold on you.

48:27.239 --> 48:31.285
Well, all the things I couldn't do
in the real world,

48:32.786 --> 48:34.830
Jubal let me do on the page.

48:37.916 --> 48:39.751
Good night, Mrs. O'Neil.

48:39.918 --> 48:41.962
Thanks for the chicken dinner.

48:47.426 --> 48:49.428
You owe me a toast, Mr. Wildhorn.

48:49.595 --> 48:51.597
I'm good for it.

48:57.561 --> 49:00.731
Your behavior tonight
was exemplary.

49:00.897 --> 49:03.900
As a result, I'm going
to lift the ban on farting.

49:06.278 --> 49:08.739
A captain born in Halifax

49:08.905 --> 49:11.116
Who dwelt in country quarters

49:11.283 --> 49:12.534
Seduced a maid
who hanged herself

49:12.701 --> 49:15.329
One morning in her garters

49:16.955 --> 49:18.206
Fetch.

49:19.666 --> 49:24.046
Maybe it's the word "fetch"
that doesn't resonate.

49:24.212 --> 49:29.676
Perhaps "retrieve" will stimulate
some long-dormant instinct.

49:29.843 --> 49:32.346
Retrieve.

49:33.430 --> 49:34.848
Retrieve.

49:39.853 --> 49:41.521
It still just looks like a street.

49:45.484 --> 49:46.526
You're holding back.

49:46.693 --> 49:48.195
I'm not.

49:49.613 --> 49:50.656
I can't do this.

49:50.822 --> 49:52.574
It's not what I hear.

49:54.534 --> 49:55.744
What?

49:55.911 --> 49:59.206
Well, word about town
is that I'm known

49:59.373 --> 50:02.668
to consider earthworm
something of a delicacy.

50:05.128 --> 50:05.962
Where did-?

50:06.129 --> 50:07.589
I have my sources.

50:07.756 --> 50:10.384
But I didn't know you then.
You know, I was just-

50:10.550 --> 50:12.302
Using your imagination.

51:11.695 --> 51:13.530
Hello?

51:13.697 --> 51:15.532
Hi. This is Monte Wildhorn.

51:15.699 --> 51:17.325
Oh, hi, Monte?

51:17.492 --> 51:18.410
Is your boy there?

51:18.577 --> 51:19.953
The boy?

51:20.120 --> 51:22.664
Oh. Oh. Hold on. Hold on.

51:22.831 --> 51:24.666
Carl! It's the phone.

51:24.833 --> 51:26.668
- The phone!
- What is it, Mom?

51:26.835 --> 51:28.670
It's a phone call, for you.

51:28.837 --> 51:30.547
It is? Who is it?

51:30.714 --> 51:31.965
Well, find out.

51:32.132 --> 51:34.342
This is Carl Loop.

51:34.509 --> 51:37.137
Oh. I must have the wrong number.

51:37.304 --> 51:39.306
I was looking for Diego Santana.

51:40.766 --> 51:42.642
I'm Diego Santana.

51:42.809 --> 51:43.935
All right, then.

51:44.102 --> 51:47.481
Saddle up, amigo.
We're riding into town.

51:47.647 --> 51:50.567
Mom, we're riding into town.

51:56.114 --> 51:57.866
Do you always wear a white hat?

51:59.409 --> 52:01.745
I wear a white hat, Diego,

52:01.912 --> 52:03.997
so the folks can tell the good guys

52:04.164 --> 52:06.625
from the bad guys
in case of gun play.

52:09.503 --> 52:10.587
What's with the goggles?

52:10.754 --> 52:12.422
Then no one knows I'm Carl.

52:13.757 --> 52:15.383
Good thinking.

52:22.015 --> 52:23.183
Now if you'll be kind enough

52:23.350 --> 52:26.436
to slide the case of spirits
on to my lap,

52:26.603 --> 52:28.563
this business will be concluded,

52:28.730 --> 52:31.775
and we can catch up
on each other's personal lives.

52:31.942 --> 52:33.944
I would be looking forward to it.

52:37.906 --> 52:39.658
What happened to the Slim Jims?

52:42.160 --> 52:44.162
What's your income
this year, Monte?

52:44.329 --> 52:48.875
I estimate my gross income
at $34 and 18 cents.

52:49.042 --> 52:52.170
A good portion of which
I've invested with Mahmoud.

52:53.380 --> 52:55.674
Sometimes
I wanna pull my pants down.

52:55.841 --> 52:57.843
Join the club.

53:10.355 --> 53:11.481
You gonna drink all that?

53:13.483 --> 53:16.027
I have every intention of doing so.

53:16.194 --> 53:17.320
Why?

53:19.447 --> 53:22.200
'Cause I'm a drunk,
and that's what we do.

53:26.621 --> 53:29.124
Get drunk enough,
you'll cry over anything.

53:30.959 --> 53:34.212
Real tears are a useful way
of getting to a place.

53:35.922 --> 53:37.132
What place?

53:37.299 --> 53:39.134
Anywhere you need to go.

53:40.552 --> 53:42.762
Now look out there and tell me
what's not there,

53:42.929 --> 53:44.472
and make me interested.

53:48.768 --> 53:50.103
I see...

53:52.397 --> 53:53.857
I see...

53:56.735 --> 53:59.070
a girl walking by the lake.

53:59.237 --> 54:00.447
How old is she?

54:00.614 --> 54:01.990
What does she look like?
What is she wearing?

54:03.533 --> 54:05.744
She's ten years old,
and she's got a ponytail.

54:05.911 --> 54:07.704
What's she doing?

54:07.871 --> 54:10.415
She's looking behind her.

54:11.791 --> 54:12.834
Why?

54:13.001 --> 54:15.712
'Cause there's a man following her.

54:17.505 --> 54:18.381
So what does she do?

54:18.548 --> 54:20.175
She starts running.

54:20.342 --> 54:21.885
He chases her.

54:22.052 --> 54:24.054
Does he catch her?

54:24.220 --> 54:26.306
No. She gets away.

54:27.307 --> 54:28.642
How?

54:28.808 --> 54:30.560
She runs to her neighbor,
Al Kaiser's house

54:30.727 --> 54:31.603
and disappears around the back.

54:31.770 --> 54:33.355
When the bad guy gets there,

54:33.521 --> 54:35.523
all he sees is one
of her sneakers lying in front

54:35.690 --> 54:37.525
of an open door that leads
down to the cellar.

54:37.692 --> 54:39.861
When the bad guys goes down
the stairs to grab her,

54:40.028 --> 54:41.571
she jumps out
from behind the big oak tree

54:41.738 --> 54:44.532
where she's been hiding and lifts
that heavy door off the ground

54:44.699 --> 54:45.784
and closes it on top of him,

54:45.951 --> 54:47.243
and before he can escape,

54:47.410 --> 54:49.412
she grabs the rake
Al Kaiser keeps by the door

54:49.579 --> 54:51.998
and slides it through the handles,
which traps the bad guy

54:52.165 --> 54:53.833
until the cops come
to take him away.

54:56.544 --> 54:58.880
Congratulations.

54:59.047 --> 55:00.966
You just made up your first story.

55:01.132 --> 55:02.884
I know, 'cause Carl Loop and me,

55:03.051 --> 55:05.220
we always used to hide there
when we didn't want our mothers

55:05.387 --> 55:06.429
to know where we were.

55:07.764 --> 55:09.516
Good instincts.

55:09.683 --> 55:11.267
You draw
from your own experiences.

55:11.434 --> 55:13.144
Now what?

55:14.938 --> 55:16.606
You work me too hard.

55:16.773 --> 55:17.857
Class dismissed.

55:19.275 --> 55:21.111
Okay. See ya.

55:23.321 --> 55:25.740
Hey, Mom, Mom!
I wrote a story!

55:25.907 --> 55:27.325
I wrote a story!

55:30.078 --> 55:32.205
I'm one hell of a mentor.

56:43.610 --> 56:49.199
Monte, you know
that dancehall gal, Miss Gussy?

56:49.365 --> 56:51.451
The one that runs
the saloon in all your books?

56:51.618 --> 56:53.244
I do.

56:53.411 --> 56:56.873
I'm surprised she and Jubal
never got together.

56:58.583 --> 57:01.461
Tell you the truth,
I was surprised too.

57:01.628 --> 57:05.882
But then, who among us
truly knows the ways of love?

57:07.509 --> 57:09.219
You got that right, sir.

57:09.385 --> 57:11.596
- Mama.
- Yes?

57:11.763 --> 57:13.348
I don't wanna paint anymore.

57:13.515 --> 57:15.433
Okay, birthday girl.
What do you wanna do?

57:15.600 --> 57:16.726
I wanna go jump

57:16.893 --> 57:18.269
Go jump

57:18.436 --> 57:22.357
However, we cannot leave
Mr. Wildhorn half done.

57:22.524 --> 57:23.525
Thank you.

57:23.691 --> 57:25.401
Listen, lady, I gotta be
outta here by 3:00.

57:25.568 --> 57:27.737
It was my understanding
I had you for the entire day.

57:27.904 --> 57:30.615
Yeah, well, I got a 4:00
on the other side of the lake.

57:36.454 --> 57:38.206
Mama, look what I made for Flora.

57:38.373 --> 57:39.499
I'm testing it for her.

57:39.666 --> 57:41.501
Oh, okay. Take it easy with that.

57:41.668 --> 57:42.836
Be careful with that, Finn, okay?

57:43.002 --> 57:44.295
I don't wanna see
any one-eyed daughters.

57:44.462 --> 57:45.713
Okay.

57:47.924 --> 57:49.676
Oh, excuse me.

57:51.469 --> 57:54.180
Jack, where are you?
It started over an hour ago.

57:59.102 --> 58:01.396
All right, hang on.

58:01.563 --> 58:04.983
Hey, Flora. Hey, honey.
It's Daddy for you.

58:05.150 --> 58:06.526
Yay.

58:14.909 --> 58:15.910
He's not coming.

58:19.122 --> 58:21.332
I don't know why I'm always surprised.

58:23.001 --> 58:24.711
I just...

58:24.878 --> 58:27.255
I guess I keep hoping
for the sake of the girls.

58:31.759 --> 58:33.303
Daddy's not coming.

58:35.930 --> 58:38.224
Oh, hey, baby girl, let's go jump.

58:38.391 --> 58:40.685
I don't wanna jump.

58:42.395 --> 58:44.772
Dad said it would be okay
if I came up to stay with him.

58:44.939 --> 58:46.774
Willow,
we are not doing this again.

58:46.941 --> 58:48.318
There's nothing for me to do here.

58:48.484 --> 58:49.444
All my friends are in the city.

58:49.611 --> 58:51.154
You know,
he can't even show up

58:51.321 --> 58:52.530
for his own daughter's birthday party.

58:52.697 --> 58:54.949
Maybe he just didn't
want to see you.

58:55.116 --> 58:56.492
That's enough.

59:08.463 --> 59:11.591
Why don't I just go and talk
to Flora for a minute?

59:12.759 --> 59:13.801
Okay.

59:16.679 --> 59:18.890
I'm looking for the birthday girl.

59:19.057 --> 59:20.767
You know where I can find her?

59:21.976 --> 59:23.394
I'm the birthday girl.

59:23.561 --> 59:25.396
Oh, good.

59:25.563 --> 59:27.565
'Cause I got something for you.

59:27.732 --> 59:29.651
What is it?

59:29.817 --> 59:31.027
It's your birthday present.

59:31.194 --> 59:32.987
I think it's here. Where'd I put it?

59:33.154 --> 59:35.198
Ah, there it is.

59:35.365 --> 59:36.616
Happy birthday.

59:36.783 --> 59:38.618
What is it?

59:38.785 --> 59:39.619
It's a story.

59:39.786 --> 59:41.162
About what?

59:41.329 --> 59:43.665
About an elephant named Tony.

59:44.832 --> 59:46.125
Well, he said he was a friend of yours,

59:46.292 --> 59:49.420
and he asked me
to write it down for him.

59:49.587 --> 59:51.089
Is Tony a real elephant?

59:51.256 --> 59:52.715
Yes, ma'am, he sure is.

59:52.882 --> 59:55.051
Thank you so much!

59:55.218 --> 59:57.387
Mom! Look what I got!

01:00:05.687 --> 01:00:07.981
Man, that is one hot lady.

01:00:08.147 --> 01:00:11.609
If she was my woman,
I'd never let her leave the bed.

01:00:11.776 --> 01:00:13.987
You know what I'm talking about.

01:00:17.407 --> 01:00:18.700
Time to go to work.

01:00:18.866 --> 01:00:20.702
Hey, you like magic tricks?
I'll do one for ya.

01:00:20.868 --> 01:00:23.037
Can you make yourself
disappear, Mr. Clown?

01:00:24.247 --> 01:00:26.374
Don't call me "Mr. Clown."

01:00:26.541 --> 01:00:27.834
I happen to be The Amazing Ted.

01:00:28.001 --> 01:00:29.919
Whatever you say, Mr. Clown.

01:00:31.462 --> 01:00:32.297
Asshole.

01:00:32.463 --> 01:00:33.965
You got my name right.

01:00:34.132 --> 01:00:35.633
It's magic time!

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:39.137
Hey! Come on, kids.
Gather 'round.

01:00:39.304 --> 01:00:41.055
Magic time!

01:00:42.849 --> 01:00:44.309
Pay close attention,

01:00:44.475 --> 01:00:48.146
because at no point
do my hands ever leave my arms.

01:00:48.313 --> 01:00:50.315
Huh?

01:00:50.481 --> 01:00:53.484
Now who here likes rabbits?

01:00:53.651 --> 01:00:55.320
I do!

01:00:58.823 --> 01:00:59.657
It slipped.

01:00:59.824 --> 01:01:01.659
Son of a bitch!

01:01:01.826 --> 01:01:04.662
Hey! Hey!
You spoiled little brat!

01:01:04.829 --> 01:01:06.914
Hey! That castle's
how I make my living.

01:01:07.081 --> 01:01:09.417
- Jesus Christ!
- Help, Mom!

01:01:09.584 --> 01:01:12.253
Everybody get away from there
before you make it worse!

01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:14.505
Somebody get
that fat kid outta there!

01:01:14.672 --> 01:01:16.883
What the hell's he doing
in there in the first place?

01:01:17.050 --> 01:01:19.886
It's for little kids.
He weighs, like, 900 pounds!

01:01:20.053 --> 01:01:21.471
Let me tell you something.

01:01:21.637 --> 01:01:22.513
You haven't heard the last of this.

01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:23.765
I got stuck.

01:01:23.931 --> 01:01:25.558
You don't think
clowns have lawyers?

01:01:25.725 --> 01:01:27.143
You better think again,

01:01:27.310 --> 01:01:28.936
'cause you're about to be
hearing from my lawyer.

01:01:33.566 --> 01:01:37.653
Reach for the sky, you mud-sucking
yellow sidewinder.

01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:38.863
All right, Jesus.

01:01:39.030 --> 01:01:40.573
Easy, man. Shit, don't shoot.

01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:42.575
I'm so gonna hear
from the parents on this one.

01:01:42.742 --> 01:01:44.494
The Amazing Ted,

01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:46.496
or Mr. Clown?

01:01:46.662 --> 01:01:49.874
Which do you prefer
on your tombstone?

01:01:50.041 --> 01:01:52.377
Oh, tombstones?
Why's he talking about tombstones?

01:01:52.543 --> 01:01:55.004
If you wanna continue
your useless existence,

01:01:55.171 --> 01:01:58.549
I strongly urge a sincere apology
to Miss Finnegan O'Neil.

01:01:58.716 --> 01:02:01.177
Okay. Okay.

01:02:01.344 --> 01:02:03.888
I'm sorry.
I'm really, really sorry.

01:02:04.055 --> 01:02:05.890
apology accepted.

01:02:06.057 --> 01:02:07.600
Now, git!

01:02:07.767 --> 01:02:10.019
Oh!

01:02:10.186 --> 01:02:12.980
Well, birthday cake, anyone?

01:02:13.147 --> 01:02:15.149
Me!

01:02:18.486 --> 01:02:20.113
Did you have fun today?

01:02:20.279 --> 01:02:22.490
I liked it
when Monte shot my clown.

01:02:22.657 --> 01:02:24.450
Oh, well, baby,

01:02:24.617 --> 01:02:26.828
Mr. Wildhorn didn't
really shoot your clown.

01:02:26.994 --> 01:02:30.289
He just, well,
wanted to get his attention.

01:02:30.456 --> 01:02:32.333
Can you read me
the elephant story?

01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:35.211
I don't see why not. You ready?

01:02:35.378 --> 01:02:36.254
Ready.

01:02:36.421 --> 01:02:37.672
Okay.

01:02:38.673 --> 01:02:40.383
"Once upon a time,

01:02:40.550 --> 01:02:45.179
"inside a finely-tuned piano
in an old house

01:02:45.346 --> 01:02:48.141
"there lived a family of mice.

01:02:48.307 --> 01:02:51.978
"They had everything mice
could possibly want in the world

01:02:52.145 --> 01:02:55.440
"because this mouse family
had wisely invested

01:02:57.024 --> 01:02:58.526
in The Cheesecake Factory."

01:03:00.445 --> 01:03:05.032
"Mrs. Mouse made sure their home
was always filled with music

01:03:05.199 --> 01:03:08.661
"by jumping up and down
on the keyboard.

01:03:08.828 --> 01:03:12.081
"The only problem they had

01:03:12.248 --> 01:03:16.043
was the cat that lived
in the house with them."

01:03:16.210 --> 01:03:18.713
Is the cat gonna eat the mouses?

01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:23.301
Oh, well, let's hope Mr. Wildhorn
isn't taking the story in that direction.

01:03:24.552 --> 01:03:25.970
Oh, well, bless you, sweetheart.

01:03:26.137 --> 01:03:27.513
Thank you.

01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:31.350
"One day, on the brightest
of summer mornings,

01:03:31.517 --> 01:03:34.770
the littlest mouse heard
a knock at the front door."

01:03:34.937 --> 01:03:36.981
Who's there?

01:03:37.148 --> 01:03:38.274
"She opened the door,

01:03:38.441 --> 01:03:42.570
"and there standing before her
was the grandest elephant

01:03:42.737 --> 01:03:45.156
"ever seen by a little mouse,

01:03:45.323 --> 01:03:47.241
"or any mouse for that matter.

01:03:47.408 --> 01:03:51.287
"'I'm pleased to meet you.
My name is Tony.

01:03:51.454 --> 01:03:52.914
"'I heard the beautiful music

01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:55.583
and wanted to see where
it was coming from."'

01:04:04.592 --> 01:04:06.969
"Tony, a traveling magician by day

01:04:07.136 --> 01:04:09.305
"and an opera singer by night,

01:04:09.472 --> 01:04:10.848
"cast a magic spell

01:04:11.015 --> 01:04:13.851
"so the mice would be
invisible to the cat.

01:04:14.018 --> 01:04:16.896
"This made
the mouse family feel very safe

01:04:17.063 --> 01:04:19.690
"and everyone was very happy.

01:04:19.857 --> 01:04:21.108
"Mrs. Mouse was so happy

01:04:21.275 --> 01:04:24.320
"that when it was time
for Tony to leave,

01:04:24.487 --> 01:04:27.323
"she scampered
all the way up his trunk

01:04:27.490 --> 01:04:30.117
"and gave him
a kiss on the cheek.

01:04:30.284 --> 01:04:33.287
Tony promptly fainted."

01:04:35.915 --> 01:04:38.626
I think this elephant likes me.

01:04:52.974 --> 01:04:55.851
Well, I suppose I could smear
the ball with peanut butter,

01:04:56.018 --> 01:04:59.313
but that would be
beneath your dignity...

01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:00.648
and mine.

01:05:12.618 --> 01:05:15.955
Well, this isn't
your first raft, Mrs. O'Neil.

01:05:16.122 --> 01:05:20.668
Finn did most of the work,
with a little help from Diego Santana.

01:05:20.835 --> 01:05:22.128
Ah.

01:05:24.463 --> 01:05:25.881
Where is everybody?

01:05:26.048 --> 01:05:28.676
Karen took them into town
for some ice cream.

01:05:28.843 --> 01:05:30.469
You didn't get to go?

01:05:31.554 --> 01:05:32.763
It was a plot.

01:05:32.930 --> 01:05:35.266
So I could finish the raft.

01:05:37.101 --> 01:05:39.770
She's had her heart set
on sailing to the island this summer...

01:05:40.896 --> 01:05:42.440
and school starts in three weeks.

01:05:44.609 --> 01:05:45.735
I see.

01:05:47.445 --> 01:05:51.115
Flora greatly appreciated
"The Elephant Who Stays Forever."

01:05:51.282 --> 01:05:53.826
I was hoping she'd like it.

01:05:54.910 --> 01:05:57.455
She made me read it to her
several times,

01:05:57.622 --> 01:06:02.960
and she asked me
if you would write more Tony stories.

01:06:05.338 --> 01:06:10.009
Well... I wouldn't
want to disappoint her.

01:06:24.982 --> 01:06:26.859
Hi, it's Dave.

01:06:27.026 --> 01:06:28.903
That's me on drums.
Leave a message.

01:06:30.363 --> 01:06:31.614
Monte, it's Joe again.

01:06:31.781 --> 01:06:33.991
It's really important
you call me back.

01:06:37.411 --> 01:06:39.372
Important for who?

01:06:49.965 --> 01:06:52.760
- Willow...
- No, thanks.

01:06:52.927 --> 01:06:55.930
Come on, Willow. This is gonna
be the adventure of a lifetime.

01:06:56.097 --> 01:06:57.098
Of a lifetime.

01:06:57.264 --> 01:07:00.559
Finnegan is not going to that island
without her big sister.

01:07:01.686 --> 01:07:02.687
Fine.

01:07:41.684 --> 01:07:42.727
A swing.

01:07:42.893 --> 01:07:45.104
Will you push me, Willow?

01:07:45.271 --> 01:07:47.064
Sure, Carl. Hop on.

01:07:50.860 --> 01:07:52.445
Whee-hee!

01:07:54.029 --> 01:07:54.905
Whoo!

01:07:55.072 --> 01:07:57.074
Higher. Whee-hee.

01:07:58.075 --> 01:07:59.493
Hang on!

01:07:59.660 --> 01:08:00.870
Push harder.

01:08:01.036 --> 01:08:02.621
- Fun?
- Yeah!

01:08:02.788 --> 01:08:04.749
Oh!

01:08:08.127 --> 01:08:09.420
I think I'm drowning!

01:08:09.587 --> 01:08:13.174
Carl! Carl, it's shallow.
Just stand up.

01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:14.508
Help me!

01:08:15.509 --> 01:08:17.219
Carl, it's shallow.

01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:19.930
You're not drowning.

01:08:24.310 --> 01:08:26.103
That was close.

01:08:52.671 --> 01:08:53.964
Whoa.

01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:57.635
What is it, Finn?

01:08:57.801 --> 01:09:00.679
It's a lunchbox.
I found it on the island.

01:09:00.845 --> 01:09:01.971
What's inside?

01:09:02.139 --> 01:09:02.973
I haven't opened it yet.

01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:04.558
Why not?

01:09:04.725 --> 01:09:06.018
Because there might
not be anything good in it.

01:09:06.185 --> 01:09:08.354
This way, I can think there's
something good even if there's not.

01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:10.314
Do you know how stupid
that sounds?

01:09:10.481 --> 01:09:13.484
No. It's like what Monte says,
seeing what's not there.

01:09:13.651 --> 01:09:16.028
I'll open it.
I wanna see what is there.

01:09:16.194 --> 01:09:17.863
Maybe it's money.

01:09:18.029 --> 01:09:20.866
Might be a chopped off hand,
Willow Tree.

01:09:21.033 --> 01:09:22.033
Don't open it!

01:09:25.871 --> 01:09:27.372
Wow... Look at all this stuff.

01:09:27.540 --> 01:09:28.999
Look, it's a diary.

01:09:29.166 --> 01:09:32.127
"Property of Charlotte Reilly,
Seventh Grade."

01:09:32.294 --> 01:09:34.755
- Who's that?
- That's Mama!

01:09:34.921 --> 01:09:36.256
Probably everything
we wanna know about her

01:09:36.423 --> 01:09:38.216
when she was a kid is in here.

01:09:38.384 --> 01:09:40.094
What do we wanna know about her?

01:09:40.261 --> 01:09:41.679
We should probably
give it back to her.

01:09:41.845 --> 01:09:43.180
I think she'd want it back.

01:09:43.346 --> 01:09:45.057
We should make her a sandwich.

01:10:20.509 --> 01:10:21.677
Lovely day, Mr. Wildhorn.

01:10:21.844 --> 01:10:25.222
Yes, ma'am. It's shaping up to be
a considerably lovely day.

01:10:30.227 --> 01:10:31.979
More Tony?

01:10:32.146 --> 01:10:33.647
Yes, ma'am.

01:10:33.814 --> 01:10:35.357
I'm sure Flora will be delighted,

01:10:35.524 --> 01:10:37.526
and I will read this to her
tonight at bedtime.

01:10:37.693 --> 01:10:38.736
Good.

01:10:41.530 --> 01:10:42.698
Thank you.

01:10:45.618 --> 01:10:50.664
Spot, that lady has a way
of making me sit taller in the saddle.

01:10:53.542 --> 01:10:56.712
Flora, look
what Mr. Wildhorn gave me.

01:10:56.879 --> 01:10:58.589
Tony the Elephant?

01:10:58.756 --> 01:10:59.757
Who's Tony the Elephant?

01:10:59.924 --> 01:11:02.426
Mr. Wildhorn wrote a story
for Flora's birthday.

01:11:02.593 --> 01:11:04.428
He did what?

01:11:04.595 --> 01:11:06.764
Read Tony, Mommy.

01:11:06.931 --> 01:11:09.808
- Let me see that!
- No, no. We'll read it tonight.

01:11:09.975 --> 01:11:14.229
Today, I want all of you girls to go outside
and play in the fresh air.

01:11:14.396 --> 01:11:16.607
Come on.
We can ride into town.

01:11:18.275 --> 01:11:20.486
Monte! Monte!

01:11:20.653 --> 01:11:23.989
Monte! I'm calling you out!

01:11:25.199 --> 01:11:27.743
You gave up Jubal McLaws
for an elephant?

01:11:27.910 --> 01:11:29.536
You told me Jubal saved your life!

01:11:29.703 --> 01:11:31.038
Then you shoot him in the back!

01:11:31.205 --> 01:11:33.624
Oh, now, hold on.

01:11:33.791 --> 01:11:36.502
I don't call writing about an elephant
shooting Jubal in the back.

01:11:37.962 --> 01:11:39.254
Jubal hasn't come calling in years.

01:11:39.421 --> 01:11:41.256
I can't write what's not there.

01:11:41.423 --> 01:11:43.258
You tell me to see what's not there.

01:11:43.425 --> 01:11:45.552
Why can't you write what's not there?

01:11:47.930 --> 01:11:49.848
You're a no-good drunk and a liar!

01:11:50.015 --> 01:11:51.850
Finnegan!

01:11:52.017 --> 01:11:53.852
He's a damn bamboozler, Willow!

01:12:01.235 --> 01:12:02.611
Mr. Wild horn?

01:12:03.779 --> 01:12:05.656
My sister believes
you're something special.

01:12:05.823 --> 01:12:07.658
Are you something special?

01:12:09.201 --> 01:12:11.412
Can't say that I ever
thought of myself like that.

01:12:11.578 --> 01:12:13.664
Well, you'd better be.

01:12:13.831 --> 01:12:15.290
'Cause otherwise,
you don't deserve Finnegan.

01:12:17.001 --> 01:12:18.168
I really hope you two make up,

01:12:18.335 --> 01:12:21.463
because I'd hate to see you
lose a friend like her.

01:12:34.351 --> 01:12:38.480
"Sometimes,
talking to people wasn't easy for Tony.

01:12:38.647 --> 01:12:41.316
"So he kept writing letters
to Mrs. Mouse,

01:12:41.483 --> 01:12:44.820
"faithfully delivered
by the tree toad.

01:12:44.987 --> 01:12:49.074
"Then a really amazing elephant
thing happened.

01:12:49.241 --> 01:12:52.119
"When elephants find
they're too nervous to speak,

01:12:52.286 --> 01:12:54.496
"they begin to dance.

01:12:54.663 --> 01:12:56.707
"Tony loved to waltz.

01:12:56.874 --> 01:12:59.501
"And before he even realized it,

01:12:59.668 --> 01:13:03.213
"he found himself waltzing
with Mrs. Mouse

01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:05.799
under the warm moonlight."

01:13:18.604 --> 01:13:19.813
"'8 Open!

01:13:29.406 --> 01:13:31.700
Hello, Joe. Been expecting you.

01:13:31.867 --> 01:13:34.995
You might want to return a phone call
every once in a while,

01:13:35.162 --> 01:13:37.414
especially to someone
you've known so long.

01:13:39.083 --> 01:13:40.584
How's the book business, Joe?

01:13:40.751 --> 01:13:44.671
Nobody reads unless
they can download.

01:13:44.838 --> 01:13:47.382
Why wouldn't you
want to hold a book?

01:13:47.549 --> 01:13:49.718
You've got a dog!

01:13:49.885 --> 01:13:53.013
Yeah, I'm dog-sitting
for the summer.

01:13:53.180 --> 01:13:54.348
You seem different.

01:13:56.433 --> 01:13:58.727
You're not, uh... yourself.

01:13:59.561 --> 01:14:00.604
Sober, you mean?

01:14:02.481 --> 01:14:04.149
Well, I've stopped before.

01:14:04.316 --> 01:14:06.401
And I'll probably start up again.

01:14:06.568 --> 01:14:08.695
But right now, I'm seeing things
with a clear eye.

01:14:08.862 --> 01:14:11.198
And quite frankly, I like the view.

01:14:11.365 --> 01:14:12.491
What can I do for you, Joe?

01:14:12.658 --> 01:14:15.536
I've come here today
to change your life.

01:14:16.870 --> 01:14:19.081
You'll collect
your usual commission for that?

01:14:19.248 --> 01:14:20.415
I certainly do.

01:14:20.582 --> 01:14:22.167
I brought Luke Ford with me.

01:14:22.334 --> 01:14:23.418
He's waiting outside.

01:14:23.585 --> 01:14:24.753
The Luke Ford?

01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:26.880
The Luke Ford.

01:14:27.047 --> 01:14:28.132
You mind if I invite him in?

01:14:28.298 --> 01:14:29.466
Be impolite not to.

01:14:29.633 --> 01:14:32.052
That's what I was thinking. Luke?

01:14:32.219 --> 01:14:33.887
Luke, why don't you join us?

01:14:36.056 --> 01:14:38.433
Come meet
the great Monte Wildhorn.

01:14:40.978 --> 01:14:42.646
Sorry, for just showing up like this,

01:14:42.813 --> 01:14:44.690
but Joe said it was the only way
I might get to meet you.

01:14:44.857 --> 01:14:45.732
I'm Luke Ford.

01:14:45.899 --> 01:14:48.277
You certainly are.

01:14:48.443 --> 01:14:50.654
I'm really pleased
to make your acquaintance.

01:14:52.948 --> 01:14:53.949
Have a seat.

01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:00.164
Luke is the reason
that I've been trying

01:15:00.330 --> 01:15:02.791
to get a hold of you all summer.

01:15:02.958 --> 01:15:06.545
I know you wanted your space,
but he's been rather insistent

01:15:06.712 --> 01:15:08.964
on acquiring the rights
to Jubal McLaws.

01:15:10.883 --> 01:15:12.634
- Is that right?
- How about that, huh?

01:15:13.886 --> 01:15:15.053
Well, Jubal's not for sale.

01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:18.515
Oh, come on now. Hear him out.

01:15:18.682 --> 01:15:21.810
He is just trying to make you
a rich son of a bitch.

01:15:21.977 --> 01:15:22.978
I'm already a son of a bitch.

01:15:23.145 --> 01:15:26.899
And I don't care to be rich,
but thanks for thinking of me.

01:15:27.065 --> 01:15:28.692
This could be
a real fresh start for you.

01:15:28.859 --> 01:15:30.736
Granted, you'll have to take
a sabbatical from the dog-sitting.

01:15:30.903 --> 01:15:33.071
I like dog-sitting.

01:15:33.238 --> 01:15:34.907
Monte, I'm a huge fan
of the old Westerns,

01:15:35.073 --> 01:15:37.659
and I'm convinced that
there's still some life left in the genre.

01:15:37.826 --> 01:15:43.165
"The Saga of Jubal McLaws"
is the best Western novel I ever read.

01:15:43.332 --> 01:15:44.958
If you allow me,

01:15:45.125 --> 01:15:47.169
I'd be honored to be the one
to bring Jubal to life.

01:15:47.336 --> 01:15:49.504
All due respect, Mr. Ford,

01:15:49.671 --> 01:15:53.550
but my late wife has already
pulled off that miracle.

01:15:53.717 --> 01:15:56.511
Then consider your readership-
this movie gets produced,

01:15:56.678 --> 01:15:58.889
they'll increase a thousand fold.

01:15:59.056 --> 01:16:00.515
Isn't that what you always wanted?

01:16:00.682 --> 01:16:02.142
I thought it was.

01:16:04.269 --> 01:16:09.024
Mr. Ford, I appreciate your taking
the time to come out here, I really do.

01:16:09.191 --> 01:16:12.527
If ever there was a man
to play Jubal, you'd be him.

01:16:13.904 --> 01:16:16.114
But right now,
I'm in a pretty good...

01:16:19.743 --> 01:16:24.289
Most times, real life doesn't measure up
to what's in our heads,

01:16:24.456 --> 01:16:27.876
but every now and then,
it comes pretty close.

01:16:28.043 --> 01:16:32.381
You happened to catch me in one
of those rarefied moments.

01:16:32.547 --> 01:16:34.925
So if it's all the same to you,

01:16:35.092 --> 01:16:37.636
I'll stick with real life for a spell.

01:16:39.012 --> 01:16:41.473
You're making a big mistake,
and I gotta tell you,

01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:42.891
this could be your last chance.

01:16:43.058 --> 01:16:45.269
I don't believe in last chances, Joe.

01:16:45.435 --> 01:16:46.270
I've had too many of them.

01:16:46.436 --> 01:16:47.980
- Monte!
- Joe...

01:16:48.146 --> 01:16:49.439
meeting's over.

01:16:55.445 --> 01:16:56.655
It's real nice meeting you.

01:17:01.618 --> 01:17:02.452
That's pretty.

01:17:02.619 --> 01:17:05.831
It's Mrs. O'Neil, next door.

01:17:05.998 --> 01:17:07.582
Real fine lady.

01:17:09.293 --> 01:17:12.379
Right now, she's talking to me.

01:17:12.546 --> 01:17:15.048
And if you don't mind,
it's a personal conversation.

01:17:17.634 --> 01:17:19.094
Mr. Wild horn,

01:17:19.261 --> 01:17:21.722
it's a pleasure
not doing business with you.

01:17:29.313 --> 01:17:31.440
How much longer are you here?

01:17:31.606 --> 01:17:32.649
Couple of weeks.

01:17:32.816 --> 01:17:35.652
Fixed all right for cash?

01:17:35.819 --> 01:17:37.321
Same as always.

01:17:37.487 --> 01:17:38.322
That's what I thought.

01:17:38.488 --> 01:17:39.948
No, thanks, Joe.

01:17:43.660 --> 01:17:45.454
You take care.

01:18:24.910 --> 01:18:27.954
I believe you owe me
a toast, Mr. Wildhorn.

01:18:29.664 --> 01:18:32.751
Here's to you,
Mrs. O'Neil, and a face

01:18:32.918 --> 01:18:36.296
that gives the moonlight
something worth shining on.

01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:46.014
What do you want
out of life, Mr. Wildhorn?

01:18:47.474 --> 01:18:49.684
I'd settle for more nights like this.

01:18:52.145 --> 01:18:54.773
I told my girls
that one of the great pleasures

01:18:54.940 --> 01:18:57.609
life has to offer is
their own search after the heart.

01:18:59.361 --> 01:19:00.529
Yes, ma'am.

01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:05.575
What would the woman
who captures your heart be like?

01:19:05.742 --> 01:19:08.745
She'd have your way
of walking into a room.

01:19:11.957 --> 01:19:13.041
How do I do that?

01:19:16.378 --> 01:19:20.132
It's sunny outside.
There's a light rainfall.

01:19:21.883 --> 01:19:25.220
You know how it feels
when a warm breeze comes with the rain?

01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:31.309
That's how you walk into a room.

01:19:35.564 --> 01:19:37.065
That's some kind of walking
I'd have to do

01:19:37.232 --> 01:19:39.484
to be worthy of such lovely words.

01:19:39.651 --> 01:19:41.945
And I'd like her to have your ears.

01:19:42.112 --> 01:19:45.782
My ears?

01:19:45.949 --> 01:19:49.202
If you don't mind me
saying so, Mrs. O'Neil,

01:19:49.369 --> 01:19:53.081
your ears look like
they can handle the soft whisper.

01:19:54.791 --> 01:19:57.878
And if you don't mind my inquiring,
Mr. Wildhorn,

01:19:58.044 --> 01:20:00.255
what would the whisper be?

01:20:00.422 --> 01:20:02.883
Well, it would be different every night.

01:20:06.511 --> 01:20:08.430
Maybe you could whisper
it in my ear while we dance.

01:20:10.307 --> 01:20:12.934
I have it on good authority
that you love to waltz.

01:20:14.769 --> 01:20:15.979
And so I do.

01:20:56.311 --> 01:20:57.437
Mr. Wildhorn?

01:20:58.605 --> 01:20:59.981
Uh, I'll be right there!

01:21:00.148 --> 01:21:03.193
Just a minute. Just a minute.

01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:04.486
I'll be right there.

01:21:04.653 --> 01:21:06.655
If it's too early, I can come back.

01:21:06.821 --> 01:21:07.697
Oh, no, no, no.

01:21:07.864 --> 01:21:10.450
Not at all. Not at all.

01:21:12.827 --> 01:21:16.873
Ah, Mrs. O'Neil.
What a pleasant surprise.

01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:18.375
What can I do for you?

01:21:18.542 --> 01:21:20.210
I have something
of a favor to ask you

01:21:20.377 --> 01:21:22.254
if it wouldn't be too much
of an imposition.

01:21:22.420 --> 01:21:25.715
After the way you played the piano
last night, no favor is too big.

01:21:25.882 --> 01:21:27.384
Thank you.

01:21:27.551 --> 01:21:30.762
It's just that I have to go into the city
for the day to meet with the lawyers.

01:21:30.929 --> 01:21:33.431
Jack and I have a few final things
to work out.

01:21:33.598 --> 01:21:37.978
I was wondering if you might
stay with the girls until I get back.

01:21:38.144 --> 01:21:40.355
It shouldn't be too late.

01:21:43.108 --> 01:21:44.818
You want me to baby-sit?

01:21:44.985 --> 01:21:47.195
If you wouldn't mind.

01:21:51.074 --> 01:21:52.826
No, no.

01:21:52.993 --> 01:21:54.744
No, I accept the challenge.

01:21:54.911 --> 01:21:58.164
Wonderful.
Thank you, Mr. Wildhorn.

01:22:01.418 --> 01:22:04.504
There's a casserole
in the fridge for dinner.

01:22:04.671 --> 01:22:08.216
And if you need to reach me,
the girls have my cell number.

01:22:08.383 --> 01:22:10.093
Okay, now, I should be home
before you go to bed,

01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:13.138
but Mr. Wildhorn
agreed to stay with you.

01:22:13.305 --> 01:22:15.223
It's okay, Mom.
I can take care of everything.

01:22:15.390 --> 01:22:17.350
Yeah, Mom.
We don't need any help.

01:22:17.517 --> 01:22:18.518
Willow can watch us.

01:22:18.685 --> 01:22:20.270
I know, this is just in case.

01:22:20.437 --> 01:22:25.233
And I expect you to behave
like ladies while I'm gone.

01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:26.776
Oh, good luck.

01:22:26.943 --> 01:22:28.111
Oh, don't worry about us.

01:22:28.278 --> 01:22:29.571
You go and fight your battles.

01:22:29.738 --> 01:22:30.905
We'll protect the homestead.

01:22:32.949 --> 01:22:34.367
Okay!

01:22:47.881 --> 01:22:49.633
Who's up for some high-stakes poker?

01:22:49.799 --> 01:22:52.802
Five-card draw.
Deuces and one-eyed jacks wild?

01:23:02.062 --> 01:23:02.896
I'll play

01:23:03.063 --> 01:23:05.065
How much you got?

01:23:05.231 --> 01:23:07.567
Mom! Mom, wait!

01:23:14.908 --> 01:23:16.076
Is Dad gonna be there?

01:23:17.410 --> 01:23:19.371
Or is it just the lawyers?

01:23:19.537 --> 01:23:21.706
Dad will be there.

01:23:24.334 --> 01:23:25.335
Will you say hello for me?

01:23:26.628 --> 01:23:27.712
Of course.

01:23:32.300 --> 01:23:33.301
I love you, Mom.

01:23:37.055 --> 01:23:38.139
I love you, too.

01:23:54.906 --> 01:23:57.909
Come on, Flora! Jump.

01:24:01.496 --> 01:24:03.498
Whoo!

01:24:20.140 --> 01:24:22.058
That's quite an arm you got there.

01:24:27.021 --> 01:24:28.857
You ever play any ball?

01:24:37.073 --> 01:24:39.117
When I was 17 years old,

01:24:39.284 --> 01:24:42.203
I could throw a baseball
90 miles an hour.

01:24:42.370 --> 01:24:44.956
Had a real live arm.

01:24:46.791 --> 01:24:51.463
Got me a minor league contract
for the St. Louis Cardinals.

01:24:51.629 --> 01:24:53.882
I played eight years
with the Memphis Chickasaws

01:24:54.048 --> 01:24:56.259
and the Portland Beavers.

01:24:56.426 --> 01:24:59.721
Double A, Triple A.

01:24:59.888 --> 01:25:03.683
Even worked my way up to the bigs
at the end of a couple of seasons.

01:25:05.685 --> 01:25:09.522
One summer day,
we were playing a doubleheader.

01:25:11.441 --> 01:25:12.901
I was pitching the opener.

01:25:14.819 --> 01:25:18.364
First batter steps into the box.

01:25:18.531 --> 01:25:21.117
I leaned in to get the sign,

01:25:21.284 --> 01:25:23.244
and out of the corner of my eye,

01:25:23.411 --> 01:25:27.999
I saw the most beautiful girl
I'd ever seen in my life.

01:25:30.001 --> 01:25:33.922
She takes a seat right
behind the catcher,

01:25:34.088 --> 01:25:37.300
and I can't take my eyes off her.

01:25:38.134 --> 01:25:40.094
I was knocked out in the first inning.

01:25:41.638 --> 01:25:43.890
But it was worth it.

01:25:44.057 --> 01:25:46.935
Her name was Mary,

01:25:47.101 --> 01:25:49.604
and we were married
eight months later.

01:25:51.105 --> 01:25:54.776
She wanted to have a lot of kids.

01:25:54.943 --> 01:25:56.277
I was all right with that.

01:25:58.154 --> 01:26:00.532
Two days before my 25th birthday,

01:26:00.698 --> 01:26:02.951
I got a call from the Cardinals.

01:26:03.117 --> 01:26:04.327
They needed a new starter.

01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:09.332
I was on my way home
from the ballpark

01:26:09.499 --> 01:26:11.000
to tell Mary the good news...

01:26:12.126 --> 01:26:14.170
when a drunk driver ran a red light...

01:26:16.798 --> 01:26:18.633
I ended up in this chair.

01:26:22.971 --> 01:26:26.391
I was sure Mary would leave me.

01:26:26.558 --> 01:26:28.935
There were times
when I almost wished she would.

01:26:31.563 --> 01:26:33.773
But she never gave up on me.

01:26:35.817 --> 01:26:37.443
She used to tell me,

01:26:37.610 --> 01:26:40.238
one door closes,
another one opens.

01:26:41.823 --> 01:26:44.617
I didn't buy into it
until one day I looked up

01:26:44.784 --> 01:26:47.412
and there was Jubal McLaws,

01:26:47.579 --> 01:26:52.083
a half smile on his face,
staring right back at me.

01:26:55.670 --> 01:26:59.215
Jubal and Mary
gave me my life back.

01:27:04.053 --> 01:27:05.930
Six years ago, Mary died...

01:27:08.850 --> 01:27:10.226
and Jubal went with her.

01:27:12.186 --> 01:27:14.314
All doors closed,

01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:15.690
bolted shut.

01:27:18.067 --> 01:27:21.154
Until one day,

01:27:21.321 --> 01:27:23.990
a nine year-old girl
named Finnegan O'Neil

01:27:24.157 --> 01:27:29.621
showed up at my door
and gave me back my legs.

01:27:36.586 --> 01:27:37.837
How did I do that?

01:27:40.465 --> 01:27:41.883
By believing with me.

01:27:43.509 --> 01:27:46.304
That's how I was able
to dance in the moonlight.

01:27:48.973 --> 01:27:50.016
You danced?

01:27:50.183 --> 01:27:53.478
In my mind, I sure did.

01:28:00.777 --> 01:28:01.819
Can't they fix you?

01:28:03.279 --> 01:28:04.864
No, Finn, they can't.

01:28:10.286 --> 01:28:12.288
Maybe you'll get a miracle.

01:28:14.290 --> 01:28:18.920
The way I see it,
I already got my miracle.

01:28:25.927 --> 01:28:27.762
Okay, so first you go to "contacts."

01:28:27.929 --> 01:28:29.180
What's "contacts"?

01:28:29.347 --> 01:28:30.932
It's the thing that looks like a book.

01:28:31.099 --> 01:28:32.308
I see a clock.

01:28:32.475 --> 01:28:33.643
It's next to the clock, see?

01:28:33.810 --> 01:28:35.436
All right. How do I get there?

01:28:35.603 --> 01:28:37.480
- See the little ball in the middle?
- Yeah.

01:28:37.647 --> 01:28:39.482
- Roll it.
- Roll it.

01:28:39.649 --> 01:28:40.566
With your thumb.

01:28:40.733 --> 01:28:43.027
With my thumb, okay.

01:28:43.194 --> 01:28:45.363
Oh! There it is. Now what?

01:28:45.530 --> 01:28:47.365
Press it.

01:28:49.367 --> 01:28:51.285
Now it's showing me the time.

01:28:51.452 --> 01:28:53.538
That's because you rolled it
while pressing it. Go back one.

01:28:53.705 --> 01:28:55.957
Ah, I don't believe I will.

01:28:56.124 --> 01:28:59.002
Like I stated at the outset,
it's not for me.

01:28:59.168 --> 01:29:02.088
Now, who can I interest
in a Mr. Pibb?

01:29:02.255 --> 01:29:03.673
Me.

01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:05.341
Come on.

01:29:09.721 --> 01:29:13.850
Uh... you let me know
if I'm doing something wrong.

01:29:14.017 --> 01:29:17.186
I never put kids to bed before.

01:29:17.353 --> 01:29:18.396
We'll help you, Monte.

01:29:18.563 --> 01:29:20.565
Oh...

01:29:20.732 --> 01:29:23.026
Shouldn't Mama be home now?

01:29:23.192 --> 01:29:24.360
She just texted me.

01:29:24.527 --> 01:29:25.778
She'll be home in a couple of hours.

01:29:31.117 --> 01:29:32.160
Well, now.

01:29:37.498 --> 01:29:39.375
All right, then...

01:29:42.253 --> 01:29:43.379
get some shuteye.

01:30:01.189 --> 01:30:03.399
We're in Dog Dave's bed.

01:30:14.911 --> 01:30:17.371
I couldn't agree more.

01:30:17.538 --> 01:30:20.374
A night like this
certainly puts you in the mood.

01:30:22.001 --> 01:30:23.836
Good evening, Mr. Wildhorn.

01:30:24.003 --> 01:30:25.505
I'm sorry I'm so late.

01:30:25.671 --> 01:30:26.923
Oh, that's all right.

01:30:28.424 --> 01:30:29.759
I didn't know what to do,

01:30:29.926 --> 01:30:32.386
so I put the little ones
in Dog Dave's bed.

01:30:33.888 --> 01:30:36.474
That'll be all they remember
about this summer.

01:30:38.309 --> 01:30:39.560
Willow fell asleep on the couch.

01:30:39.727 --> 01:30:40.853
I hope they weren't too much trouble.

01:30:41.020 --> 01:30:42.772
Oh, just the opposite.

01:30:46.442 --> 01:30:49.403
Well, I guess I better
take 'em off your hands.

01:30:49.570 --> 01:30:52.865
I don't mind
if you wanna leave 'em for the night.

01:30:53.032 --> 01:30:54.450
Are you sure?

01:30:54.617 --> 01:30:56.494
It'd be a shame
to wake 'em at this hour.

01:30:57.662 --> 01:30:59.831
Oh. Okay. Thanks.

01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:06.379
Well, uh...

01:31:06.546 --> 01:31:08.297
I better be getting back.

01:31:08.464 --> 01:31:11.509
If you don't feel too tired,
you might wanna sit a spell.

01:31:13.719 --> 01:31:14.846
Okay.

01:31:23.604 --> 01:31:25.022
I'm gonna miss this place.

01:31:26.899 --> 01:31:27.900
Where will you go?

01:31:29.318 --> 01:31:31.821
Not quite sure.

01:31:31.988 --> 01:31:34.740
I have some cat-sitting
prospects in Mexico.

01:31:38.161 --> 01:31:40.580
I thought I'd try Nueva Rosita.

01:31:41.789 --> 01:31:43.082
It's a little town I wrote about

01:31:43.249 --> 01:31:45.459
when Jubal was holed up
down in those parts

01:31:45.626 --> 01:31:47.962
hiding out from a posse.

01:31:48.129 --> 01:31:50.173
Figured it'd be
a good place to write.

01:31:51.841 --> 01:31:53.926
I'm glad you're writing again.

01:31:55.344 --> 01:31:58.973
Flora just loves the Tony stories.

01:31:59.140 --> 01:32:02.977
So you said. What about you?

01:32:10.359 --> 01:32:12.486
I'm greatly fond of them as well.

01:32:20.161 --> 01:32:22.163
This has been a wonderful summer.

01:32:25.333 --> 01:32:29.962
There's only one thing
that I know I'll wish I had done.

01:32:31.631 --> 01:32:32.965
What's that?

01:32:35.218 --> 01:32:37.803
Had our waltz in the moonlight.

01:32:46.103 --> 01:32:47.688
I know what you mean.

01:32:55.613 --> 01:32:56.989
Sure you don't want me
to take the girls?

01:32:57.156 --> 01:32:58.783
I mean,
where are you gonna sleep?

01:32:58.950 --> 01:33:02.203
Ah, sleeping under the stars
has never been a hardship.

01:33:04.413 --> 01:33:05.539
Well...

01:33:08.209 --> 01:33:10.628
I guess I'll just come back
and get them in the morning.

01:33:12.338 --> 01:33:14.340
Good night, Mrs. O'Neil.

01:33:24.934 --> 01:33:26.435
Good night, Mr. Wildhorn.

01:33:49.709 --> 01:33:51.711
He's sleeping.

01:34:01.429 --> 01:34:04.473
Sorry, Monte.
We were sneaking out.

01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:06.267
We want to surprise Mama.

01:34:06.434 --> 01:34:10.021
Well, your sneaking skills
could use a little work.

01:34:18.696 --> 01:34:20.656
Should we wake her up?

01:34:20.823 --> 01:34:22.533
No, I think we should let her sleep.

01:34:22.700 --> 01:34:25.995
When do you think she'll wake up?

01:34:26.162 --> 01:34:28.372
Oh, good, you're up.

01:34:30.958 --> 01:34:32.793
Oh, good morning, girls.

01:34:35.338 --> 01:34:38.007
To what do I owe this lovely intrusion?

01:34:39.425 --> 01:34:41.344
Here. This is for you.

01:34:41.510 --> 01:34:44.680
Oh, wow!

01:34:50.770 --> 01:34:53.647
My goodness. Where...?

01:34:54.690 --> 01:34:55.524
I found it on the island.

01:34:57.193 --> 01:34:59.278
Oh...

01:34:59.445 --> 01:35:00.613
Eat the sandwich.

01:35:02.365 --> 01:35:04.325
I haven't seen this since-

01:35:04.492 --> 01:35:06.369
Eat the sandwich.

01:35:06.535 --> 01:35:07.620
Okay.

01:35:10.456 --> 01:35:12.083
Mmm...

01:35:12.249 --> 01:35:13.417
Do you like it?

01:35:13.584 --> 01:35:14.710
I love it.

01:35:14.877 --> 01:35:17.088
Come here. Come here, you three.

01:35:25.304 --> 01:35:27.556
Was the alcohol defective?

01:35:27.723 --> 01:35:29.975
Changing my ways, Mahmoud.

01:35:30.142 --> 01:35:32.353
Uh, two Slim Jims, please.

01:35:41.612 --> 01:35:44.073
You know,
I'm leaving tomorrow, Carl.

01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:45.241
Okay.

01:35:49.453 --> 01:35:51.038
Does that mean
I can't be Diego anymore?

01:35:51.205 --> 01:35:53.749
No, you can be anybody
you want to be.

01:35:54.875 --> 01:35:57.711
But I gotta tell you,
I kind of miss that Carl fella.

01:35:57.878 --> 01:35:59.088
He's very special.

01:36:01.048 --> 01:36:03.050
I'm Carl.

01:36:04.051 --> 01:36:06.303
Danged if you're not.

01:36:06.470 --> 01:36:09.098
I wanted to give you something
to remember me by.

01:36:15.312 --> 01:36:16.939
Fits good.

01:36:17.106 --> 01:36:19.066
A little sweaty.

01:36:20.734 --> 01:36:21.902
So long, partner.

01:36:37.543 --> 01:36:38.836
What are you planting?

01:36:39.003 --> 01:36:41.046
Pumpkins.

01:36:41.213 --> 01:36:43.716
Thought it'd be nice if we grow
our own for Halloween.

01:36:43.883 --> 01:36:45.468
Need some help?

01:36:45.634 --> 01:36:46.677
Sure.

01:36:52.808 --> 01:36:55.060
What do you do?

01:36:55.227 --> 01:36:56.395
Well, it's easy.

01:36:56.562 --> 01:37:00.441
You just dig a little hole
and drop one in.

01:37:00.608 --> 01:37:02.610
I think I can handle that.

01:37:06.989 --> 01:37:07.990
How is Dad?

01:37:09.867 --> 01:37:10.951
He's okay.

01:37:12.912 --> 01:37:13.913
How are you doing?

01:37:15.915 --> 01:37:16.916
I'm okay.

01:37:18.209 --> 01:37:19.627
What about you?

01:37:19.793 --> 01:37:21.795
What's going on with you,
Willow Tree?

01:37:24.548 --> 01:37:26.842
I never thought
about your parents getting divorced.

01:37:30.679 --> 01:37:32.056
I read your diary.

01:37:35.809 --> 01:37:37.102
I kind of figured.

01:37:39.271 --> 01:37:43.609
It's weird, Mom,
but the fact that you felt so bad...

01:37:45.277 --> 01:37:46.445
kind of made me feel better.

01:37:48.364 --> 01:37:49.740
Is that wrong?

01:37:51.575 --> 01:37:52.701
No.

01:37:55.621 --> 01:37:56.830
I'm glad you read it.

01:38:02.294 --> 01:38:05.965
All right, big guy,
Last Chance Saloon.

01:38:07.883 --> 01:38:09.885
Fetch.

01:38:14.848 --> 01:38:17.434
I respect consistency.

01:38:36.495 --> 01:38:39.665
Well, just the person I wanted to see.

01:38:39.832 --> 01:38:41.917
Come on in.
I got a couple of things for you.

01:38:46.505 --> 01:38:47.631
There you go.

01:38:47.798 --> 01:38:49.633
$34.

01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:52.511
I'm afraid I'll have
to owe you the 18 cents.

01:38:52.678 --> 01:38:55.306
But you taught me
what you said you would.

01:38:55.472 --> 01:38:58.809
Yeah, but I wasn't counting
on you teaching me a whole lot.

01:38:58.976 --> 01:39:00.769
Go on, take it.

01:39:03.230 --> 01:39:04.857
Thanks.

01:39:05.024 --> 01:39:06.859
Wait. I ain't done.

01:39:14.241 --> 01:39:15.534
What's this?

01:39:15.701 --> 01:39:19.413
I don't like it
when my fans get short-changed.

01:39:19.580 --> 01:39:22.166
You said you were
missing the last page of the saga.

01:39:22.333 --> 01:39:25.794
That's what I meant to write
in the first place.

01:39:27.379 --> 01:39:29.340
Wow...

01:39:29.506 --> 01:39:31.717
Now you have
to promise me something.

01:39:31.884 --> 01:39:33.594
Okay.

01:39:33.761 --> 01:39:38.182
Never stop looking
for what's not there.

01:39:40.601 --> 01:39:42.227
I promise.

01:39:42.394 --> 01:39:43.937
Good.

01:39:46.398 --> 01:39:48.233
I'm leaving early in the morning,

01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:53.364
so we'd best say
our proper good-byes here and now.

01:39:55.949 --> 01:39:57.076
Do you have to go?

01:39:59.995 --> 01:40:02.539
If I ever had me a little girl...

01:40:03.999 --> 01:40:06.043
I guess I'd want her to be you.

01:40:54.675 --> 01:40:56.510
Well, I'll be damned.

01:41:21.869 --> 01:41:23.287
Be careful with that.

01:41:26.999 --> 01:41:29.877
You sure you'll
be all right with Spot?

01:41:30.043 --> 01:41:32.296
He'll be well taken care of,
Mr. Wildhorn.

01:41:32.463 --> 01:41:37.468
Ah... I think it's about time
we dispensed with the formalities.

01:41:37.634 --> 01:41:39.261
Call me Monte.

01:41:41.013 --> 01:41:41.847
Monte.

01:41:42.014 --> 01:41:43.807
Charlotte.

01:41:45.768 --> 01:41:48.187
It's nice to be
on a first-name basis.

01:41:52.274 --> 01:41:53.400
Well, I think that's everything.

01:41:53.567 --> 01:41:55.194
But I'll give it one last look.

01:41:55.360 --> 01:41:56.820
Okay.

01:41:56.987 --> 01:41:58.447
Wait! Wait!

01:41:58.614 --> 01:42:00.616
Wait a second!

01:42:04.411 --> 01:42:06.538
Here. This is for you.

01:42:06.705 --> 01:42:08.707
Do you like it?

01:42:08.874 --> 01:42:12.127
Oh... it's a surprisingly
accurate rendering,

01:42:12.294 --> 01:42:14.171
and I shall cherish it.

01:42:14.338 --> 01:42:15.380
Thank you.

01:42:15.547 --> 01:42:18.008
Remember, you owe me 18 cents.

01:42:18.175 --> 01:42:21.220
The debt weighs heavily.

01:42:53.794 --> 01:42:55.504
Hi, Mom.

01:42:55.671 --> 01:42:57.381
Hey, how was school?

01:42:57.548 --> 01:42:58.590
Good.

01:42:58.757 --> 01:42:59.758
What did you do?

01:42:59.925 --> 01:43:01.468
Nothing.

01:43:01.635 --> 01:43:03.720
Uh-huh.

01:43:03.887 --> 01:43:05.514
Do we have any more Gushers?

01:43:05.681 --> 01:43:08.016
- You'll have to check.
- Okay.

01:43:08.183 --> 01:43:09.309
Melanie is such a freak.

01:43:09.476 --> 01:43:10.894
I'm dropping her
as a friend off Facebook.

01:43:11.061 --> 01:43:14.690
Uh-huh... And what's going on
with you and Kyle?

01:43:14.857 --> 01:43:18.402
Nothing. Ava says he likes me,
but he's too shy.

01:43:18.569 --> 01:43:20.612
Well, why don't you just
go up and talk to him?

01:43:20.779 --> 01:43:23.031
Mom, you don't know anything.

01:43:24.032 --> 01:43:26.034
Apparently not.

01:43:33.208 --> 01:43:36.753
Charlotte,
sorry I haven't been in touch,

01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:42.301
but it's taken me a while
to master this e-mail texting thing.

01:43:42.467 --> 01:43:44.469
I hope the girls are all doing well,

01:43:44.636 --> 01:43:47.556
and I hope you're keeping up
with your piano playing.

01:43:47.723 --> 01:43:49.600
I've been pretty busy lately.

01:43:49.766 --> 01:43:53.270
I'm happy to report that I've found
the perfect place to write.

01:43:53.437 --> 01:43:56.440
I liked it so much,
I went ahead and bought it.

01:43:56.607 --> 01:43:58.775
Oh, I should say Jubal bought it.

01:43:58.942 --> 01:44:00.819
I sold the movie rights.

01:44:00.986 --> 01:44:02.696
I'm pretty sure you'd approve.

01:44:21.757 --> 01:44:24.092
Dog Dave drove a hard bargain.

01:44:24.259 --> 01:44:26.970
Said he would only sell
if I agreed to take Spot.

01:44:29.306 --> 01:44:30.974
What happened to-?

01:44:31.141 --> 01:44:33.560
Mexico?

01:44:33.727 --> 01:44:36.063
Never quite made it.

01:44:36.229 --> 01:44:37.773
A writer needs inspiration.

01:44:37.940 --> 01:44:40.776
And I thought the odds
of seeing you down there.

01:44:40.943 --> 01:44:43.111
Well...

01:44:44.905 --> 01:44:47.157
Monte! Monte's here!
Monte's here!

01:44:47.324 --> 01:44:49.785
Willow, Flora! Monte's here!

01:44:52.079 --> 01:44:53.246
Monte!

01:44:58.085 --> 01:44:59.795
You come to visit us, Monte?

01:44:59.962 --> 01:45:01.213
Well, if it's
all the same to you ladies,

01:45:01.380 --> 01:45:04.216
I thought I'd stay a while.

01:45:04.383 --> 01:45:07.094
Looking forward to having
you as a neighbor, Mr. Wildhorn.

01:45:07.260 --> 01:45:08.929
Just keep the noise down,
Mrs. O'Neil.
