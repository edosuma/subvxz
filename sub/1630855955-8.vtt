WEBVTT

00:05.788 --> 00:07.311
Nat, answer it.

00:07.311 --> 00:09.009
No, don'’t answer it.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.184
This is not gonna be good.

00:10.184 --> 00:11.707
I do love my boyfriend,

00:11.707 --> 00:14.275
but I definitely have feelings
developing for Luka.

00:14.275 --> 00:15.798
I need to take a step back.

00:15.798 --> 00:17.974
I'’m gonna keep it to a bare
minimum with you today.

00:17.974 --> 00:19.019
I'’m just gonna say hi, bye.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.324
I'’m not even gonna talk to you.

00:20.324 --> 00:23.066
Amanda Britt would like
a casino atmosphere

00:23.066 --> 00:24.415
created on the yacht.

00:24.415 --> 00:26.548
Oh my God, she can have
whatever she wants.

00:26.548 --> 00:29.464
As much as you'’re tempted,
you know that line.

00:29.464 --> 00:30.813
Don'’t cross it.

00:33.163 --> 00:35.818
They are really, like, excited.

00:35.818 --> 00:38.342
Maybe, like, a bit of
downforce on the tail with me.

00:38.342 --> 00:39.126
Exac--

00:39.126 --> 00:40.431
Oh, sh--, you okay?

00:40.431 --> 00:42.129
I just want to get it
checked out.

00:42.129 --> 00:44.000
Nikola'’s in charge
while I'’m gone.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.523
I'’m----ing sh--ing myself.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.360
I'’m not biting
my tongue anymore.

00:58.449 --> 01:00.147
Did we hit the refresh button?

01:00.147 --> 01:02.497
A refresh button does not mean
I have to be friends with you.

01:02.497 --> 01:05.456
It'’s her tone that
- ing aggravates me.

01:05.456 --> 01:07.850
I hate an all-girl group.

01:07.850 --> 01:10.026
I'’m going to housekeeping.
I'’ll take over from Jess.

01:10.026 --> 01:12.289
No, they'’re going to be fun.
They'’re just going to be busy.

01:12.289 --> 01:14.248
Kyle has more experience.

01:15.423 --> 01:17.164
Should we talk about
how Tumi and Jess

01:17.164 --> 01:19.035
are going to run
service this charter?

01:21.168 --> 01:24.084
The way he says it kind of
makes it seem like I'’m green.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.737
Yesterday, Jess came to me.

01:28.349 --> 01:30.177
Why would you go to
Tumi behind my back?

01:30.177 --> 01:32.135
She said, Kyle makes me feel
like a green stew,

01:32.135 --> 01:33.615
which makes me feel
Kyle belittles me.

01:33.615 --> 01:35.573
Why did I come to you
and say take-up service

01:35.573 --> 01:38.576
when I was emotionally upset
and didn'’t come to Natalya?

01:38.576 --> 01:41.231
Because I had
faith in----ing you.

01:48.020 --> 01:49.718
ing drama.

01:49.718 --> 01:51.241
What the hell just happened?

01:51.241 --> 01:54.549
How is the littlest thing
getting projected onto me

01:54.549 --> 01:57.117
when there'’s bigger
- ing issues around?

01:57.117 --> 01:58.770
Like, I'’m so confused.

02:07.257 --> 02:08.780
Why is he so ticked
off by that?

02:08.780 --> 02:12.132
It'’s like I----ing
attacked him or something.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.872
That was very harsh.

02:22.272 --> 02:23.317
40 pounds.

02:23.317 --> 02:25.362
You are a sociopath.

02:26.798 --> 02:28.757
<i>Jess, Jess, Tumi,
how are the cabins going?</i>

02:28.757 --> 02:32.239
Oh, my, the fact that
she'’s not even asking me.

02:32.239 --> 02:34.589
There'’s one cabin left to do.

02:34.589 --> 02:36.895
Okay, when you'’re done, Natalya,
please go on your break.

02:36.895 --> 02:38.593
Copy.

02:38.593 --> 02:40.508
I'’m not friends with anybody.

02:40.508 --> 02:42.336
I don'’t trust a single
- ing person on this boat.

02:45.426 --> 02:46.731
What'’s up, Tuminator?

02:46.731 --> 02:49.081
Do you know when
Captain Sandy'’s coming back?

02:49.081 --> 02:50.344
No, she didn'’t really say.

02:50.344 --> 02:51.780
Hopefully it'’s just bruised.

02:51.780 --> 02:53.173
I feel----ing terrible.

02:53.173 --> 02:54.957
Sandy'’s like the heart
of the ship.

02:54.957 --> 02:57.525
It'’s definitely important for me
to make sure everything'’s 100%

02:57.525 --> 02:59.788
because it feels
like it'’s my fault.

02:59.788 --> 03:01.224
I just hope she'’s okay.

03:01.224 --> 03:03.357
Hopefully, Sandy'’s back soon.

03:05.924 --> 03:07.448
Okay. Thanks, bro.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.494
Ladies!

03:11.539 --> 03:12.844
Oh, there goes the water!

03:12.844 --> 03:14.585
We have a question.

03:18.633 --> 03:20.243
- I'’ll ask the boys.
- Okay.

03:20.243 --> 03:21.375
- That would be cute.
- Yeah.

03:21.375 --> 03:23.203
Your Prosecco'’s coming now.

03:26.293 --> 03:27.903
What'’s happening, doll?

03:27.903 --> 03:29.165
My life. I don'’t know what
the [bleep] happening.

03:29.165 --> 03:30.558
I'’m very confused.

03:32.560 --> 03:36.303
Yeah, knowing my partner
has put his...

03:36.303 --> 03:38.827
hoo-ha in another woman,
it'’s very heartbreaking.

03:41.090 --> 03:43.223
<i>Yeah.</i>

03:47.879 --> 03:50.317
It'’s just adding so much more
anxiety and stress onto me.

03:50.317 --> 03:51.666
All right, enjoy your life. Goodbye.

03:51.666 --> 03:52.971
Ciao.

03:52.971 --> 03:54.364
I can'’t wait to see
what'’s for dinner.

03:54.364 --> 03:55.670
Want to go say hi to him?

03:55.670 --> 03:57.541
Let'’s make sure he
comes to dinner.

04:02.546 --> 04:05.201
- Your food?
- It'’s so----ing delicious.

04:05.201 --> 04:06.550
What are we having tonight?

04:06.550 --> 04:08.726
Making some homemade
tortellinis to start.

04:08.726 --> 04:10.337
- No.
- Stop.

04:10.337 --> 04:12.774
And I'’ve got a really
fancy chocolate mousse.

04:12.774 --> 04:14.993
It'’s not just
another chocolate mousse.

04:14.993 --> 04:16.952
This is literally her
favorite food ever.

04:16.952 --> 04:18.519
It'’s not a normal chocolate
mousse. It'’s like a really...

04:18.519 --> 04:20.434
Oh!

04:20.434 --> 04:22.610
These women do seem to
be going a bit overboard.

04:22.610 --> 04:24.525
Like, it'’s almost
like the Beatlemania.

04:24.525 --> 04:26.309
Like, you know, I feel
like the fifth Beatle.

04:26.309 --> 04:28.659
You know, I am from
Liverpool, by the way.

04:30.487 --> 04:31.619
- Really?
- Of course.

04:31.619 --> 04:33.098
- Yeah, of course.
- Okay, cool.

04:33.098 --> 04:34.404
We don'’t want to bother you.

04:34.404 --> 04:35.710
Like, as long as you can
hang out with us, hang.

04:35.710 --> 04:36.711
Okay, okay.

04:36.711 --> 04:38.147
If I must.

04:38.147 --> 04:40.236
Here'’s where I help the chefs.

04:40.236 --> 04:41.281
Wait, is the crew mess this way?

04:41.281 --> 04:42.847
The dishes, plates.

04:42.847 --> 04:44.719
Yeah, wait, where do
you guys hang out?

04:44.719 --> 04:46.721
- Where do you eat?
- In the crew mess.

04:46.721 --> 04:48.244
- Oh, where'’s the crew mess?
- Can we go in?

04:48.244 --> 04:49.593
- Yeah, yeah.
- We have to go in.

04:49.593 --> 04:50.812
Can we see your room?

04:50.812 --> 04:52.335
- Ah!
- Yes.

04:52.335 --> 04:53.554
Sorry, Max.

04:53.554 --> 04:55.033
Wow!

04:57.166 --> 04:58.428
Welcome in the candy shop.

04:58.428 --> 04:59.908
Oh, my God!

04:59.908 --> 05:02.345
- This is so cool.
- This is where we hang out.

05:05.217 --> 05:08.133
- Wait, show us your room.
- My cabin with Luka is here.

05:08.133 --> 05:09.526
- This one?
- Look at the succulent.

05:09.526 --> 05:11.354
- Look at this!
- What is this?

05:11.354 --> 05:12.573
- Is my...
- Max?

05:12.573 --> 05:14.226
Are you reading about
how to have sex?

05:14.226 --> 05:16.098
Yeah, a lot about sex.

05:16.098 --> 05:17.404
Oh, God!

05:17.404 --> 05:19.362
Oh, my God, you have--

05:19.362 --> 05:20.929
Oh, my God, he'’s highlighting!

05:20.929 --> 05:23.105
No, no, no, no!

05:23.105 --> 05:24.628
Read it to us in English.

05:24.628 --> 05:26.282
Look at him blushing.

05:26.282 --> 05:28.066
Go, read it.

05:30.460 --> 05:32.767
It'’s like 2,000 years ago.

05:32.767 --> 05:36.466
Like, he was like some monk
that was like specialized

05:36.466 --> 05:38.686
like the sex energy, you know?

05:38.686 --> 05:41.341
This sometimes speak about
like ejaculation of man

05:41.341 --> 05:43.734
and should...

05:43.734 --> 05:46.128
It'’s not like orgasm,
you know?

05:46.128 --> 05:47.825
It'’s two things different.

05:59.663 --> 06:01.056
Thank you for taking me home.

06:01.056 --> 06:03.624
- With pleasure, with pleasure.
- Best tour ever.

06:03.624 --> 06:06.540
We need to find out
whose radio that is.

06:06.540 --> 06:07.932
You'’ve got yours on.

06:07.932 --> 06:09.369
Yeah.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.109
<i>Max, Max, Luca.</i>

06:11.109 --> 06:12.676
Have you got your radio, bro?

06:15.070 --> 06:16.680
Bro.

06:18.987 --> 06:21.119
No, it'’s here.

06:24.122 --> 06:25.646
I just want to smash him,

06:25.646 --> 06:27.952
but I just can'’t stop
myself from laughing.

06:27.952 --> 06:29.998
He works off
positive reinforcement

06:29.998 --> 06:33.131
and he really does
make the crew more happy.

06:33.131 --> 06:35.177
But if he wasn'’t funny,

06:35.177 --> 06:38.049
like he'’d be----ed,
that'’s for sure.

06:40.878 --> 06:42.053
You okay?

06:42.053 --> 06:43.881
Yeah, you okay?

06:46.667 --> 06:48.016
What are you giggling about?

06:53.500 --> 06:54.718
For sure.

06:56.807 --> 06:58.461
Woo!

07:02.596 --> 07:04.598
Oh, my God.

07:04.598 --> 07:06.643
You guys are ripping.

07:11.605 --> 07:13.433
How are you doing?

07:13.433 --> 07:14.738
Get out of my face.

07:14.738 --> 07:16.044
- Kyle...
- I don'’t want to talk to you.

07:16.044 --> 07:17.872
I didn'’t mean it
in a malicious way.

07:17.872 --> 07:19.308
You know what you meant.
You'’re malicious as hell.

07:19.308 --> 07:20.352
Malicious?

07:20.352 --> 07:21.441
You gaslit Tumi against me.

07:21.441 --> 07:22.703
Your words are,

07:22.703 --> 07:24.487
"I make you feel like
a green stew."

07:24.487 --> 07:27.185
That means I'’m making you feel
lower than what you actually are

07:27.185 --> 07:30.058
and what you'’re capable
of doing, which I'’ve never done.

07:30.058 --> 07:32.713
That'’s what I'm trying to
communicate to you right now.

07:32.713 --> 07:34.279
- Honey, you speak...
- You'’re interpreting it wrong.

07:34.279 --> 07:36.586
You'’re an English speaker.
I'’m an English speaker.

07:36.586 --> 07:38.066
Our communication is perfect.

07:38.066 --> 07:40.895
Is my heart very sore?
Am I very angry right now?

07:40.895 --> 07:42.462
Am I going to say things
I don'’t mean right now?

07:42.462 --> 07:44.855
Yes.
Because I'’m emotional.

07:44.855 --> 07:46.161
And I'’m very hurt because
I'’ve really thought

07:46.161 --> 07:48.642
you were there
for me since day one.

07:48.642 --> 07:49.947
I really am very hurt.

07:55.344 --> 07:56.388
Coming up...

07:56.388 --> 07:57.477
Amore.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.740
That'’s a thirst----ing trap.

07:59.740 --> 08:02.656
Welcome to your booze cruise.

08:02.656 --> 08:06.355
Guys, you have to tell me
if my tits come out.

08:06.355 --> 08:08.183
You will never control me.

08:08.183 --> 08:09.271
Kyle, take a water.

08:09.271 --> 08:10.838
You can'’t tell people what--

08:10.838 --> 08:13.754
I don'’t need you to control
everybody'’s opinion.

08:13.754 --> 08:16.670
Focus on your own
- ed up life

08:16.670 --> 08:18.759
before you [bleep] up on ours.

08:24.025 --> 08:26.070
Two more
for the beautiful ladies.

08:26.070 --> 08:28.116
- Thank you.
- Which one? Which one?

08:29.770 --> 08:32.773
Are you okay?
Come give me a hug. Look at me.

08:35.602 --> 08:37.604
Tell me what you want.

08:37.604 --> 08:39.780
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

08:45.437 --> 08:46.656
The first time was in the cabin.

08:46.656 --> 08:48.310
when me and Natalya
were in the cabin.

08:48.310 --> 08:52.488
Like full on just like going off
about the whole green stew thing

08:52.488 --> 08:54.621
and then I just went to go
and apologize to him

08:54.621 --> 08:56.144
and explain what I meant.

08:56.144 --> 08:58.320
And he'’s like, no,
you'’re like malicious.

09:00.975 --> 09:02.672
Jess, just breathe.

09:03.630 --> 09:05.022
Jess, just breathe.

09:07.590 --> 09:09.157
When you guys are done.

09:09.157 --> 09:11.725
Can we have lychee martini?
Please.

09:11.725 --> 09:13.335
When you'’re done, don't rush.

09:13.335 --> 09:14.379
Okay.

09:14.379 --> 09:15.598
- I'’ll make it.
- Are you sure?

09:15.598 --> 09:16.904
Yeah.

09:16.904 --> 09:18.079
You can go take a
minute if you want.

09:19.776 --> 09:23.171
I don'’t take men
yelling at me very well.

09:23.171 --> 09:26.957
And I think it'’s because I never
had a father figure growing up.

09:26.957 --> 09:28.872
My mom was a single mom.

09:28.872 --> 09:30.787
She had me at 16 years old.

09:30.787 --> 09:33.181
I never met
my biological father.

09:33.181 --> 09:36.184
So just having
a strong male personality

09:36.184 --> 09:41.058
scream at me in my face is not
something I'’m used to at all.

09:42.407 --> 09:45.715
Just finding out the tea
what was going on with Jess.

09:54.898 --> 09:56.683
I don'’t know.

09:56.683 --> 09:58.815
I don'’t know what
happens up there.

09:59.773 --> 10:01.383
Yeah.

10:01.383 --> 10:04.125
This is definitely not what
I expected with yachting.

10:04.125 --> 10:06.649
The chaos and drama
just like reminds me

10:06.649 --> 10:09.043
of like middle school.

10:09.043 --> 10:10.522
It'’s----ing stupid.

10:10.522 --> 10:13.395
I am thankful that like
our biggest problem

10:13.395 --> 10:18.313
on the deck team is
how many reps Max got today

10:18.313 --> 10:19.749
with his pull-ups.

10:23.971 --> 10:25.233
You wanna go in your cabin?

10:25.233 --> 10:26.495
Yeah.

10:26.495 --> 10:28.018
So, here'’s the thing.

10:28.018 --> 10:30.064
Okay, let me hear you
and then I'’ll talk after

10:30.064 --> 10:31.587
because I know where
this is going.

10:31.587 --> 10:32.719
This is what I'’m gonna do then.

10:32.719 --> 10:34.198
She does service
with me tonight.

10:34.198 --> 10:35.896
So you guys are separate.

10:35.896 --> 10:37.419
You'’re with Natalya
in housekeeping

10:37.419 --> 10:38.638
until she goes to bed.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.074
Then we'’re together.

10:40.074 --> 10:41.989
We'’re just avoiding each
other until tomorrow

10:41.989 --> 10:43.730
If you speak to her,
just speak to her nicely.

10:43.730 --> 10:46.776
You forget so much how
Kyle'’s like a little toddler.

10:46.776 --> 10:48.996
Like he'’s like
30 going on three.

10:48.996 --> 10:52.347
And it'’s frustrating because
I didn'’t see what happened.

10:52.347 --> 10:56.090
I need Jess to feel safe
and I need Kyle to know

10:56.090 --> 10:57.569
that he cannot speak
to her that way.

10:57.569 --> 10:59.136
The captain'’s off the boat.

10:59.136 --> 11:01.704
This is a time that we should
be keeping things together

11:01.704 --> 11:03.314
and I am here to just
put out fires.

11:03.314 --> 11:05.621
- Thanks.
- Let this blow over.

11:05.621 --> 11:07.188
Thanks for talking.

11:07.188 --> 11:08.711
This is my favorite
drink of all time.

11:08.711 --> 11:10.017
Oh my God, would you
like a sip?

11:10.017 --> 11:11.322
No, I'’m not allowed but

11:11.322 --> 11:12.541
I'’m gonna watch you
and envy you.

11:12.541 --> 11:14.195
Thank you.

11:14.195 --> 11:16.806
Jess, Jess, Tumi.
What'’s your location?

11:16.806 --> 11:18.503
- Sun deck.
- Perfect.

11:24.335 --> 11:25.989
- I spoke to him.
- What did he say?

11:25.989 --> 11:29.079
I was just like just to be nice
when you speak

11:29.079 --> 11:31.255
and I feel like it was just
the wrong time to talk to him

11:31.255 --> 11:34.041
because everyone'’s emotions
are heightened.

11:34.041 --> 11:36.304
So they'’re gonna have
a little boozie-cruise.

11:36.304 --> 11:39.437
Serve them alcohol and then
do you want to do dinner

11:39.437 --> 11:41.570
with me tonight so that
we'’re together?

11:41.570 --> 11:43.050
Yeah.

11:43.050 --> 11:44.442
So that we'’re
just not mixing.

11:44.442 --> 11:46.488
- Be fine.
- I'’m proud of you.

11:46.488 --> 11:47.924
I know it'’s hard.

11:50.274 --> 11:51.928
What'’s the name of the
girl in the movie?

11:51.928 --> 11:53.756
Britney Spears.

11:53.756 --> 11:54.931
Yeah, of course.

11:54.931 --> 11:56.150
With Michael Jackson.

11:56.150 --> 11:57.151
Yeah.

11:57.151 --> 11:58.587
Yeah, good movies.
Good movie.

11:58.587 --> 11:59.980
Hee hee!

11:59.980 --> 12:02.156
Max is a funny guy
so he'’s growing on me.

12:02.156 --> 12:03.984
He'’s a----ing good person.

12:03.984 --> 12:05.681
He does have a good heart like...

12:05.681 --> 12:08.292
He reads books.
Who reads books?

12:08.292 --> 12:10.251
Let'’s put the tender
on that side.

12:10.251 --> 12:12.253
Move the jetski one
on to the dock.

12:12.253 --> 12:13.602
Yeah.

12:17.258 --> 12:20.174
Nat, just so you know,
dress up stuff in here.

12:20.174 --> 12:22.306
- For tonight?
- Like leggings, a wig.

12:22.306 --> 12:24.831
I want that----ing wig
I wore that first charter.

12:24.831 --> 12:26.702
- This one.
- Yeah?

12:26.702 --> 12:27.834
Funny.

12:27.834 --> 12:29.400
Perfect.
Plastic cups.

12:29.400 --> 12:31.272
Do you want to do
the casino thing?

12:31.272 --> 12:33.013
Is it on the main table
or in the interior?

12:33.013 --> 12:34.231
Interior.

12:35.755 --> 12:36.756
What is that?

12:36.756 --> 12:38.235
Snapper.

12:38.235 --> 12:41.151
I am gonna pack waters
for the booze cruise and stuff.

12:43.719 --> 12:45.547
You'’re wearing this tonight
with no shirt.

12:45.547 --> 12:46.591
No. Bro...

12:46.591 --> 12:47.810
This is the money.

12:47.810 --> 12:48.811
I'’m telling you
you want the tip.

12:48.811 --> 12:50.073
This is where it'’s at.

12:50.073 --> 12:51.683
Okay, but let'’s----ing
go out then.

12:51.683 --> 12:53.598
Let'’s do it. I'd love to be
a piece of salami

12:53.598 --> 12:55.818
between that sandwich,
you know what I'’m saying?

13:01.563 --> 13:02.607
Let'’s----ing go.

13:02.607 --> 13:04.435
<i>Frenchy, come on,
in the tender.</i>

13:04.435 --> 13:06.873
This thing is way too small for
what'’s gonna happen on it.

13:06.873 --> 13:07.961
We'’ll make it work.

13:07.961 --> 13:09.310
Golden hour.

13:09.310 --> 13:10.920
Amore!

13:10.920 --> 13:12.661
That'’s a thirst----ing trap.

13:12.661 --> 13:15.925
Yes, boy!

13:15.925 --> 13:17.622
Welcome to your booze cruise.

13:17.622 --> 13:20.408
Guys, you have to tell me
if my tits come out.

13:21.931 --> 13:26.153
- Bye.
- Ciao.

13:26.153 --> 13:27.589
Who wants a drink?

13:27.589 --> 13:28.720
Me!

13:31.680 --> 13:34.161
- Thanks, Doll.
- Madame.

13:35.684 --> 13:37.207
You think I'’m married?

13:37.207 --> 13:40.210
Yeah.
You have ring.

13:40.210 --> 13:42.473
That'’s my mom's initial.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.702
So cute!

13:56.226 --> 13:58.359
What is this
outfit we'’re doing?

13:58.359 --> 14:00.143
It'’s a neon casino.

14:01.492 --> 14:04.147
Natalya, let me show
you a boner killer.

14:06.454 --> 14:09.326
That actually suits you so well.

14:10.675 --> 14:12.547
It suits you so well.

14:13.896 --> 14:15.289
Oh my God.

14:15.289 --> 14:16.812
This is how you do it.

14:16.812 --> 14:18.509
Okay. Okay.

14:19.946 --> 14:21.991
Who'’s this pulling up?

14:21.991 --> 14:23.688
Is it Captain Sandy?

14:24.776 --> 14:26.909
- Captain!
- Yay!

14:26.909 --> 14:28.824
We'’ve got our captain back!

14:28.824 --> 14:29.869
How are you, captain?

14:29.869 --> 14:31.087
Are you okay?

14:33.568 --> 14:34.525
Oh, really?

14:35.875 --> 14:40.357
You'’re aliv--
Oh my God, what did you do?

14:42.969 --> 14:44.492
Thank you.

14:44.492 --> 14:47.538
The good news is he didn'’t
have to set it.

14:47.538 --> 14:49.105
I have a high
tolerance of pain.

14:49.105 --> 14:51.499
I kind of had a feeling
that I broke my wrist.

14:51.499 --> 14:52.804
I know what that feels like

14:52.804 --> 14:54.415
because I broke this
one snowboarding.

14:54.415 --> 14:56.373
At least you can
still drive the boat.

14:56.373 --> 14:59.115
If it was worse and
I couldn'’t drive the boat,

14:59.115 --> 15:01.988
then I would have to
be replaced as captain.

15:01.988 --> 15:04.033
The good news is
it'’s not that bad

15:04.033 --> 15:05.861
and I can still
drive the vessel.

15:05.861 --> 15:08.168
I'’m back.

15:08.168 --> 15:11.258
Good. Thank you holding down
the fort.

15:11.258 --> 15:12.999
I really appreciate it.

15:12.999 --> 15:14.478
Awesome, thank you.

15:15.958 --> 15:17.177
Woo!

15:17.177 --> 15:19.266
- I love this group.
- Yeah.

15:21.616 --> 15:22.704
Oh, yeah.

15:22.704 --> 15:24.401
Drink up.

15:25.576 --> 15:28.884
- Wow, Madame.
- Mademoiselle.

15:28.884 --> 15:30.364
Mademoiselle, ah, yes.

15:30.364 --> 15:33.541
What?
I'’m on----ing vacation.

15:33.541 --> 15:36.196
Luka, can you give me a heads
up when you'’re coming in?

15:36.196 --> 15:37.849
I'’ve got to surprise the guests.

15:37.849 --> 15:39.329
We'’re heading back now.

15:39.329 --> 15:41.592
We'’ll probably be there
in like ten minutes.

15:41.592 --> 15:42.854
<i>Copy.</i>

15:42.854 --> 15:44.334
This has been a beautiful
sunset cruise.

15:44.334 --> 15:45.379
We just need to get shots immediately.

15:45.379 --> 15:46.597
They'’re five minutes away.

15:46.597 --> 15:50.210
Oh, this smells like
tomorrow night.

15:50.210 --> 15:52.342
Cheffy, do you have a menu
for me for tonight?

15:52.342 --> 15:53.561
Yeah, yeah.
Three courses.

15:55.911 --> 15:57.217
Shots!

15:57.217 --> 15:59.001
I love it!

15:59.001 --> 16:01.177
Homemade squash
and sage tortellinis,

16:01.177 --> 16:03.223
pickled cauliflowers,
saffron sauce.

16:03.223 --> 16:05.051
All right.
Have a good dinner.

16:05.051 --> 16:07.401
Mademoiselle.

16:07.401 --> 16:09.098
And I'’m having dessert
with them apparently.

16:09.098 --> 16:10.360
Okay, so that'’s the chocolate.

16:10.360 --> 16:12.145
How do you say it?
Marquise?

16:12.145 --> 16:14.234
Chocolate marquise and there'’s
a vegan one for Carlie.

16:14.234 --> 16:16.105
- Cheers!
- Thank you!

16:16.105 --> 16:17.889
Drink, drink,
drink drink.

16:20.805 --> 16:22.155
Let'’s go change.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.073
Oh my God.

16:27.073 --> 16:29.771
Be honest.
You'’re horny.

16:29.771 --> 16:31.555
Hello.
How was it?

16:31.555 --> 16:33.079
- It'’s broken.
- Is it?

16:33.079 --> 16:35.124
- Yeah.
- Little fracture?

16:35.124 --> 16:36.125
It'’s a little fracture.

16:36.125 --> 16:37.300
Damn.

16:37.300 --> 16:38.301
Yeah, you know,
I can still drive.

16:38.301 --> 16:39.389
That'’s the good news.

16:39.389 --> 16:40.390
So you just have to wear that?

16:40.390 --> 16:42.001
Yeah, for five weeks.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.480
- Yeah.
- Good to see you.

16:43.480 --> 16:45.134
Good to see you, too.

16:45.134 --> 16:46.614
To see that it'’s----ing broken

16:46.614 --> 16:47.919
and she'’s still
got that attitude?

16:47.919 --> 16:50.792
I'’m like [bleep], you...

16:50.792 --> 16:51.967
You'’re a boss.

16:51.967 --> 16:54.013
We'’re going to go
lift that tender.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.275
Thank you.

16:55.275 --> 16:56.624
When we start, I'’ll get
you to do waters

16:56.624 --> 16:58.234
and I'’ll do their drinks.

16:58.234 --> 16:59.801
I'’ll have you waiting
to run the plates.

16:59.801 --> 17:02.064
- Okay.
- But I'’ll guide you through it.

17:02.064 --> 17:04.153
- You got it.
- I got it.

17:04.153 --> 17:05.720
Hey, honey.

17:05.720 --> 17:08.070
We'’re going to lift that tender
before it gets too dark.

17:08.070 --> 17:09.376
Max is going to prep it.

17:09.376 --> 17:11.639
- Okay.
- Okay, I go on the tender?

17:11.639 --> 17:12.596
Yep.

17:22.345 --> 17:24.826
Oi.
Inside the seat.

17:24.826 --> 17:25.914
Not over the top.

17:25.914 --> 17:27.785
- Oh, [bleep].
- Yeah.

17:27.785 --> 17:29.657
You'’re thinking about
your new wife.

17:29.657 --> 17:31.702
Captain Sandy, are you okay?

17:31.702 --> 17:33.443
Yes. Okay, so...

17:34.749 --> 17:38.666
Launching.
I was launching the...

17:38.666 --> 17:39.841
- Kayak.
- Yes, you heard, right?

17:39.841 --> 17:41.756
And I backed out and
fell on my bum.

17:41.756 --> 17:44.150
I mean, I can drive.
I just have to move this.

17:44.150 --> 17:46.239
Well, your crew is top-notch.

17:46.239 --> 17:47.762
I know, right?
I trusted them.

17:47.762 --> 17:50.417
- We had so much----ing fun.
- They did a good job.

17:50.417 --> 17:52.636
Coming down a little bit.

17:52.636 --> 17:54.943
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

17:54.943 --> 17:56.118
Ta-da.

17:56.118 --> 17:57.859
Oh, my gosh.
It'’s so pretty.

17:57.859 --> 17:59.165
Gorgy.

17:59.165 --> 18:01.123
- Still or sparkling?
- Still, please.

18:01.123 --> 18:02.124
Okay.

18:02.124 --> 18:03.778
I need to fix my wig.

18:03.778 --> 18:05.649
You need to fix your life.
You'’re like a mess, babe.

18:05.649 --> 18:07.521
Look at yourself.
You'’re like Cruella de Ville.

18:07.521 --> 18:09.044
Like, an orange version.

18:09.044 --> 18:10.567
Yeah, well, you'’ve just gone
and pissed me off.

18:10.567 --> 18:11.916
I might as well start
fighting with you, too.

18:11.916 --> 18:13.179
What happened? What?

18:13.179 --> 18:16.138
Jess feels a certain way,
like a...

18:16.138 --> 18:17.139
or something like that.

18:17.139 --> 18:18.532
Bullsh--.

18:18.532 --> 18:20.490
No, you can'’t harvest
the negative energy.

18:20.490 --> 18:22.101
What am I supposed to say?

18:22.101 --> 18:25.147
Oh, Jess, thank you so much
for talking sh-- behind my back.

18:25.147 --> 18:27.410
Oh, my... Argh!

18:27.410 --> 18:30.674
All my drama has been based
around the interior,

18:30.674 --> 18:32.589
who think they deserve the world

18:32.589 --> 18:34.722
without even first
gaining the experience.

18:34.722 --> 18:36.811
Tired of this.
It'’s exhausting.

18:38.813 --> 18:40.989
Coming up...

18:40.989 --> 18:42.208
Cheers.

18:42.208 --> 18:43.557
What, are you
going to get fired?

18:43.557 --> 18:45.515
The thing is, I can feel
Tumi'’s eyes on me

18:45.515 --> 18:47.604
because I know deep down
it'’s wrong myself.

18:50.259 --> 18:51.652
You have to tell her.

18:51.652 --> 18:53.132
She'’s isn't going to find out,
isn'’t she?

18:53.132 --> 18:54.394
Unless people go snitching.

18:54.394 --> 18:55.656
Oh, she'’s going to find out.

19:04.360 --> 19:05.579
Is this a penis?

19:05.579 --> 19:07.015
It'’s a----ing cherry.

19:07.015 --> 19:10.236
I haven'’t seen a dick
in a very long time.

19:10.236 --> 19:11.454
Going up there, Jessica,

19:11.454 --> 19:13.152
are you still standing
around drinking?

19:13.152 --> 19:14.675
- No, they'’re sitting now.
- They'’re sitting already?

19:14.675 --> 19:16.503
Yeah, they just got
bread service.

19:16.503 --> 19:18.679
When it gets basil, you can go.

19:18.679 --> 19:20.289
Okay.

19:20.289 --> 19:21.725
If you don'’t feel confident
doing three, don'’t do it.

19:21.725 --> 19:23.727
I'’ll not, because it's soupy.

19:23.727 --> 19:25.512
And it'’s hot, so no.

19:25.512 --> 19:28.776
Being on service with this
sh-- day that I'’ve had,

19:28.776 --> 19:31.126
Kyle being a rude bitch to me,

19:31.126 --> 19:32.301
it'’s actually really good.

19:32.301 --> 19:34.695
It reminds me I'’m a good stew.

19:34.695 --> 19:36.871
Makes my heart
feel a little better.

19:36.871 --> 19:38.481
Thank you.

19:38.481 --> 19:42.398
So your first course is homemade
squash and sage tortellini.

19:42.398 --> 19:43.660
Thank you.

19:43.660 --> 19:45.140
I need to marry a chef.

19:45.140 --> 19:46.489
It'’s so good.

19:47.534 --> 19:49.188
Okay, you want to go with them?

19:49.188 --> 19:50.189
Yeah.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.364
- Lara!
- Coming!

19:51.364 --> 19:52.887
Get your ass in here.

19:54.323 --> 19:56.543
Does Cheffy remember
he'’s having dessert with us?

19:56.543 --> 19:57.848
Who were you talking to?

19:59.937 --> 20:03.506
She'’s like, excuse me.
Excuse me.

20:03.506 --> 20:06.248
Anyway, you guys are
having pan fried snapper

20:06.248 --> 20:08.337
with roast and
pickled cauliflower

20:08.337 --> 20:10.339
and some saffron sauce.

20:10.339 --> 20:11.862
- Amazing.
- Enjoy.

20:11.862 --> 20:13.299
- So good, thank you.
- Of course.

20:13.299 --> 20:14.300
Thank you.

20:14.300 --> 20:15.518
Wait, come here, please.

20:15.518 --> 20:16.867
If this has got sticky
stuff on it.

20:16.867 --> 20:17.781
Oh, wow.

20:17.781 --> 20:19.130
- This is incredible.
- Mm-hmm.

20:19.130 --> 20:21.176
- They are happy.
- Good.

20:23.178 --> 20:24.788
What?

20:24.788 --> 20:26.660
Oh, yeah, I'’ll do it for you.
I'’ll do it for you now.

20:26.660 --> 20:27.965
That'’d be embarrassing.

20:27.965 --> 20:28.966
Okay.

20:28.966 --> 20:30.098
Oh, God.

20:32.622 --> 20:34.320
So we need to swap sides.

20:34.320 --> 20:36.017
Mm-hmm.

20:36.017 --> 20:38.367
Okay, like, I mean,
like, you just go like...

20:38.367 --> 20:39.368
Oh.

20:39.368 --> 20:40.717
Sorry.

20:40.717 --> 20:41.892
Are you trying to let me
fall over backwards?

20:41.892 --> 20:43.546
You'’re just backing up on me.

20:43.546 --> 20:45.156
You'’ve literally given
your attention from me

20:45.156 --> 20:46.245
to these ladies.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.376
Take it easy.

20:47.376 --> 20:48.551
I think we should just tape it.

20:48.551 --> 20:50.249
No, that is not going anywhere.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.467
You reckon?

20:51.467 --> 20:53.817
Good job.

20:54.688 --> 20:56.211
I don'’t feel like it.

20:56.211 --> 20:57.386
Oh, come on.

20:57.386 --> 20:59.867
How did it even
come into conversation?

20:59.867 --> 21:02.478
He just heard
green stew and flipped.

21:02.478 --> 21:03.871
- Yeah, I know.
- Literally.

21:03.871 --> 21:06.047
Eyes on the prize,
baby, and that'’s money.

21:06.047 --> 21:07.222
Yeah, for real.

21:09.093 --> 21:10.530
You did a great job.

21:10.530 --> 21:12.923
Once these lights are on, pink.

21:12.923 --> 21:14.403
Stunning.

21:14.403 --> 21:16.405
All crew, all crew.
I'’m headed to bed.

21:16.405 --> 21:18.581
If you need me,
just knock on my door.

21:18.581 --> 21:21.280
Ha-ha!
Just in time.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.411
Are you going to help us?

21:22.411 --> 21:24.239
Oh, I was just in
time to eat one,

21:24.239 --> 21:25.632
but here I can help you.

21:25.632 --> 21:27.242
Ready? You can go when you'’ve
got that on.

21:27.242 --> 21:28.548
Perfect.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.031
Cheffy!

21:35.119 --> 21:36.251
Sit down, take a breath.

21:36.251 --> 21:38.601
Thank you so much
for the best dinner.

21:38.601 --> 21:40.211
Thank you.

21:40.211 --> 21:42.039
This is the best thing I'’ve ever
had in my whole life.

21:42.039 --> 21:45.434
This is her favorite thing
in the entire world.

21:45.434 --> 21:46.653
Mmm.

21:46.653 --> 21:47.654
Where are you from?

21:47.654 --> 21:49.090
Liverpool, England.

21:49.090 --> 21:50.221
Very nice.

21:50.221 --> 21:51.440
She'’s also from England.

21:51.440 --> 21:52.441
- Oh, my God.
- Where are you from?

21:52.441 --> 21:54.487
Born and raised in London.

21:54.487 --> 21:56.619
Not sure if you'’re
familiar with the place.

21:56.619 --> 21:58.621
I used to live in London,
so I do know it.

21:58.621 --> 22:00.144
No, she'’s lying.
She'’s from Maryland.

22:00.144 --> 22:02.146
You know, Maryland.

22:02.146 --> 22:04.932
How are you ladies
with drinks?

22:04.932 --> 22:06.281
Another round
of kamikaze shots.

22:06.281 --> 22:07.891
Copy.

22:07.891 --> 22:10.807
- Can you have a shot?
- I don'’t think I'm allowed.

22:11.852 --> 22:13.549
No, that'’s not my decision.

22:13.549 --> 22:14.507
Have to ask the captain.

22:14.507 --> 22:15.899
Yeah, he needs a shot, too.

22:15.899 --> 22:17.118
Shots requested.

22:21.209 --> 22:23.385
If you demand it,
I'’ve got to do the shot.

22:23.385 --> 22:25.648
- I demand it!
- Demand!

22:25.648 --> 22:26.649
No doing it.

22:26.649 --> 22:27.650
Oh, okay, I'’ll taste it.

22:29.043 --> 22:33.395
Shots, shots, shots,
shots, shots, shots.

22:33.395 --> 22:34.657
Uh-oh.

22:36.180 --> 22:37.530
All right, cheers.

22:37.530 --> 22:39.227
- Wait, do you not have one?
- I didn'’t get one.

22:45.407 --> 22:46.800
The whole thing, though.

22:46.800 --> 22:49.629
What, are you
going to get fired?

22:49.629 --> 22:52.545
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

22:54.155 --> 22:55.896
I didn'’t even want the shot.

22:55.896 --> 22:57.637
I feel like I'’ve been possessed.

22:57.637 --> 22:58.812
That was awful.

22:58.812 --> 23:00.291
I can feel Tumi'’s eyes on me

23:00.291 --> 23:02.206
because I know deep down
it'’s wrong myself.

23:02.206 --> 23:04.774
I don'’t know why I'm doing this,
but I'’m doing it.

23:12.086 --> 23:13.783
Yay!

23:15.045 --> 23:15.872
Did he?

23:15.872 --> 23:17.091
Yeah, I need to go tell him.

23:17.091 --> 23:18.875
Because he'’s not allowed
to do that.

23:18.875 --> 23:22.313
- Yeah, we'’re not allowed.
- Yeah.

23:22.313 --> 23:24.794
What is your favorite gin?
Because I'’m a gin freak.

23:24.794 --> 23:27.884
- Probably Bombay.
- You like Bombay?

23:27.884 --> 23:28.711
Yeah.

23:28.711 --> 23:30.191
Lord have mercy.

23:30.191 --> 23:34.151
Women are literally
the messiest of humankind.

23:34.151 --> 23:35.718
All right, ladies. I'’m going
to have to go clean down.

23:35.718 --> 23:37.285
But I will see you.

23:41.028 --> 23:43.247
Thank you.

23:47.774 --> 23:49.558
- Should we go ahead?
- Are we ready?

23:49.558 --> 23:52.518
Oh, my God!

23:52.518 --> 23:54.911
- Who'’s having rosé?
- I am.

23:54.911 --> 23:56.652
You guys did such
a good job here.

23:56.652 --> 23:58.175
- Oh, you like it?
- It'’s so gorg.

23:58.175 --> 24:00.482
- Natalya did this.
- It looks amazing.

24:00.482 --> 24:01.657
ing hell.

24:01.657 --> 24:02.876
Cheffy!

24:03.746 --> 24:05.748
This is amazing.

24:05.748 --> 24:06.793
Put these on the numbers.

24:06.793 --> 24:08.142
Any numbers?

24:08.142 --> 24:09.317
Mine'’s 12.

24:10.405 --> 24:13.669
You guys, this is incredible.

24:14.670 --> 24:15.932
I'’m so hungry.

24:15.932 --> 24:17.847
Dude, I'’ve been
eating song sandwiches.

24:17.847 --> 24:21.068
I really don'’t feel well.
I really feel dizzy.

24:21.068 --> 24:22.591
All right. You can go to bed.
Thank you.

24:22.591 --> 24:23.766
- All right, ladies.
- Thank you.

24:23.766 --> 24:26.203
- Good night.
- Good night.

24:26.203 --> 24:28.728
- See you tomorrow.
- Thank you.

24:28.728 --> 24:30.338
Natalya.
Natalya, Tumi.

24:30.338 --> 24:31.426
Go ahead.

24:31.426 --> 24:33.036
<i>Can you go down?</i>

24:33.036 --> 24:35.125
Copy. I'’m just turning two more
pieces and I'’ll go down.

24:35.125 --> 24:36.257
Put five down.

24:36.257 --> 24:37.693
I already did 12.

24:37.693 --> 24:39.434
Well, you keep losing.

24:39.434 --> 24:41.305
Good crowd.
I like them.

24:44.526 --> 24:46.746
They'’re----ing sexy as well.

24:46.746 --> 24:48.748
- They are.
- No.

24:48.748 --> 24:51.620
You definitely have
a crush on them.

24:51.620 --> 24:52.839
I'’m human.

24:52.839 --> 24:54.493
And you taking a
little sneaky shot?

24:54.493 --> 24:55.885
Yeah?

24:55.885 --> 24:58.061
I'’m like, this guy's got guts.

24:58.061 --> 25:00.455
Sandy is so strict on that.

25:00.455 --> 25:01.978
You have to tell her.

25:01.978 --> 25:03.676
You don'’t want her to find out.

25:04.981 --> 25:06.156
She'’s not going
to find out, is she?

25:06.156 --> 25:08.507
Unless people go snitching.

25:08.507 --> 25:10.160
Oh, she'’s going to find out.

25:10.160 --> 25:13.773
I feel like I'’m giving Jack
the opportunity to tell Sandy

25:13.773 --> 25:15.688
because she'’ll find out
some way or other,

25:15.688 --> 25:17.037
whether it'’s through the guests,

25:17.037 --> 25:18.647
whether it'’s
through a crew member.

25:18.647 --> 25:20.127
Like, she would find out.

25:20.127 --> 25:22.477
And I really hope
he does the right thing.

25:23.783 --> 25:24.740
- Wait, so should we go to bed.
- Yes.

25:24.740 --> 25:25.741
Yeah.

25:25.741 --> 25:27.177
We might as well.

25:27.177 --> 25:29.136
- Guests aren'’t stupid, eh?
- No, dude.

25:29.136 --> 25:32.269
That'’s why I'm like,
it'’s so pointless tonight.

25:32.269 --> 25:33.662
- Tumi.
- What?

25:33.662 --> 25:34.750
I don'’t feel good.

25:34.750 --> 25:35.751
What do you mean?

25:35.751 --> 25:37.057
I'’m very dizzy.

25:37.057 --> 25:38.711
Oof.

25:41.061 --> 25:42.932
Kyle, are you being dramatic?

25:42.932 --> 25:44.238
No, I'’m serious.

25:45.631 --> 25:47.197
I feel very dizzy.

25:47.197 --> 25:49.025
Oh.

25:49.896 --> 25:52.028
I should lie down.

25:52.028 --> 25:54.248
I don'’t know what to do.

25:54.248 --> 25:56.380
I feel so dizzy.

25:56.380 --> 25:57.730
No.

25:57.730 --> 25:59.253
Damn.

26:05.172 --> 26:06.521
I feel very dizzy.

26:06.521 --> 26:08.567
Lara, Lara, Tumi.

26:08.567 --> 26:09.568
Thank you.

26:09.568 --> 26:10.612
Liza, put those down.

26:10.612 --> 26:12.222
Woo!

26:13.920 --> 26:15.704
- Like, on his back.
- No.

26:15.704 --> 26:17.488
He said he was feeling
super dizzy.

26:17.488 --> 26:20.143
What'’s going on, boy?

26:22.798 --> 26:23.799
I'’m so dizzy.

26:23.799 --> 26:25.584
Do you have a cold towel?

26:25.584 --> 26:27.411
Yeah, I can get
the cold towel.

26:27.411 --> 26:30.545
I mean, I feel like the vibe
is kind of like early.

26:30.545 --> 26:31.546
- Yeah.
- Let'’s go.

26:31.546 --> 26:32.765
Bye, queens.

26:32.765 --> 26:34.070
Yeah.

26:34.070 --> 26:35.898
That'’s pretty cool.

26:35.898 --> 26:36.899
I'’ve been drinking water
all day.

26:36.899 --> 26:37.900
I'’m not dehydrated.

26:37.900 --> 26:39.423
I'’m just so dizzy.

26:39.423 --> 26:40.729
Have you eaten?

26:40.729 --> 26:42.078
Yes, this morning.

26:42.078 --> 26:43.950
- That'’s probably why.
- This is why.

26:43.950 --> 26:46.822
Time to have some healthy food.

26:46.822 --> 26:48.998
I don'’t know if
I'’m just tired or what.

26:48.998 --> 26:51.958
Like, all this----ing sh--
is just getting to me.

26:51.958 --> 26:55.614
All this----ing stupid drama.

26:55.614 --> 26:57.485
And I'’m exhausted.

26:58.747 --> 27:00.096
I'’m just tired.

27:00.096 --> 27:01.794
I know.

27:01.794 --> 27:05.580
It'’s a build-up of emotions,
stress, anxiety and not eating.

27:08.235 --> 27:09.192
Do you think some noodles?

27:09.192 --> 27:10.411
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

27:10.411 --> 27:11.934
Oh, God.

27:11.934 --> 27:14.415
- Holy sh--.
- Oh, the floor.

27:15.721 --> 27:17.766
ing Kyle.

27:17.766 --> 27:20.290
He'’s lying on the floor
in the main salon.

27:20.290 --> 27:22.162
He'’s crying and he's dizzy.

27:22.162 --> 27:24.077
He'’s like, he doesn't
know what'’s going on.

27:24.077 --> 27:26.209
- Wait, with the guests?
- No.

27:26.209 --> 27:27.558
I'’m going to make
him some noodles.

27:27.558 --> 27:31.127
It could just be an
anxiety attack, as well.

27:31.127 --> 27:34.174
This is just not who
I aim to be like.

27:34.174 --> 27:35.958
You know, the older we get,

27:35.958 --> 27:39.570
we don'’t want to deal with
this sh-- no more, you know?

27:39.570 --> 27:44.227
I just don'’t want to listen
to all this sh--, like...

27:44.227 --> 27:47.666
Natalya'’s up and down
with this relationship

27:47.666 --> 27:48.971
and feeling this and that.

27:48.971 --> 27:50.799
I don'’t know what
I can'’t do it.

27:50.799 --> 27:52.671
- I know.
- I don'’t know.

27:52.671 --> 27:54.803
It'’s okay.

27:54.803 --> 27:56.370
Come on, go to bed.

27:56.370 --> 27:57.327
But I think we need to get
you straight down to your room

27:57.327 --> 27:59.982
so you get comfy
and in your bed.

27:59.982 --> 28:04.552
Just overworked, I'’m like,
not this, but just everything.

28:06.293 --> 28:08.599
I'’m not a stranger
to anxiety attacks at all.

28:08.599 --> 28:10.558
I had them in my early 20s.

28:10.558 --> 28:14.257
I think the pressure of the
whole season is getting to Kyle.

28:14.257 --> 28:16.999
It'’s why I deal with
people'’s drama at arms' length,

28:16.999 --> 28:18.958
because you internalize it.

28:20.611 --> 28:22.918
Your body will always
tell you what it needs.

28:22.918 --> 28:25.704
And if you'’re not going to stop,
your body'’s going to stop.

28:25.704 --> 28:27.140
We got it.

28:32.623 --> 28:33.712
Hello, baby.

28:33.712 --> 28:35.539
What are you doing?

28:55.037 --> 28:57.257
Please don'’t overwork yourself.

28:57.257 --> 28:58.432
Yeah.

29:13.099 --> 29:15.057
It is
exceptionally overwhelming

29:15.057 --> 29:18.278
not only to physically
work these long hours,

29:18.278 --> 29:20.759
but also deal with
the emotional burden

29:20.759 --> 29:22.238
that I have been going through.

29:22.238 --> 29:25.807
I last felt like
this four years ago.

29:25.807 --> 29:27.330
It was my first yacht,

29:27.330 --> 29:29.898
similar case with crew
members talking amongst

29:29.898 --> 29:31.813
and under each other.

29:31.813 --> 29:33.423
I was depressed.

29:33.423 --> 29:35.686
I was in a vehicle
with the first officer.

29:35.686 --> 29:39.125
I just opened the car
on the I-95 and jumped out.

29:40.691 --> 29:45.479
I wanted to feel physical hurt
as opposed to emotional hurt.

29:47.002 --> 29:49.526
I'’m feeling that
exact same person here.

29:49.526 --> 29:52.834
What do I do?
Quit my job and not have money?

29:52.834 --> 29:54.662
Or do I stay and
carry on fighting?

30:05.629 --> 30:06.674
Coming up...

30:06.674 --> 30:07.849
I----ed up a little
bit last night.

30:07.849 --> 30:09.155
What?

30:09.155 --> 30:10.460
I had a shot with
the guests at the table.

30:10.460 --> 30:11.635
Okay.

30:11.635 --> 30:13.289
- I wanted you to know before...
- Okay.

30:13.289 --> 30:14.290
But that'’s it.

30:14.290 --> 30:16.466
- Pack your sh--.
- Yeah.

30:29.349 --> 30:31.003
Drop-off day, bitches.

30:31.003 --> 30:34.136
Get that tip money.

30:35.790 --> 30:36.878
No.

30:36.878 --> 30:38.793
What?

30:45.147 --> 30:46.279
Yeah.

31:00.989 --> 31:02.773
I didn'’t think it was
appropriate that he had to add

31:02.773 --> 31:04.688
that little like
punch at the bottom.

31:04.688 --> 31:06.560
I'’m going to speak
to him about that

31:06.560 --> 31:08.257
when he wakes up.
He can'’t be writing that.

31:13.045 --> 31:14.698
Good morning.

31:14.698 --> 31:18.746
I'’m like way more----ing
hungover today than yesterday.

31:18.746 --> 31:20.139
Let me get you a water.

31:20.139 --> 31:21.662
Oh, thank you so much.

31:26.493 --> 31:29.496
Oh my God, it'’s been like
a couple weeks.

31:29.496 --> 31:31.672
For me, it'’s been six months.

31:31.672 --> 31:33.326
Seriously.

31:33.326 --> 31:37.678
I just really want to get laid
right now, you know? [bleep] me.

31:37.678 --> 31:39.767
I don'’t even know what
it feels like anymore.

31:39.767 --> 31:42.509
Oh, shut up.

31:42.509 --> 31:45.381
The special is smoked salmon
and scrambled eggs.

31:46.687 --> 31:48.123
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

31:48.123 --> 31:49.168
What do you got there?

31:49.168 --> 31:50.691
Some oats.

31:50.691 --> 31:52.301
I copied her.

31:52.301 --> 31:54.390
Yours look way better.

31:56.479 --> 31:58.351
So today, Cheffy'’s special

31:58.351 --> 32:01.702
is smoked salmon
and scrambled eggs.

32:01.702 --> 32:02.964
- Perfect.
- Sounds good to me.

32:02.964 --> 32:04.748
- Yep.
- Health is wealth.

32:04.748 --> 32:06.359
Exactly.

32:07.273 --> 32:08.622
I'’m not rushing.

32:08.622 --> 32:10.145
Not that I don'’t care.

32:10.145 --> 32:11.538
I'’m just being up
until 5 A.M.

32:11.538 --> 32:13.540
I think we should have
an interior meeting

32:13.540 --> 32:15.411
as soon as the guests hop off.

32:16.935 --> 32:18.023
You and Jess.

32:18.023 --> 32:19.372
That'’s for me and
Jess to sort out.

32:19.372 --> 32:20.547
No, but she'’s now upset again

32:20.547 --> 32:22.723
because of the end
of that message.

32:22.723 --> 32:24.246
I don'’t care.

32:26.640 --> 32:28.947
Honey, I don'’t want you to
get in between me and Jess.

32:31.166 --> 32:34.604
No, but then she shouldn'’t come
and talk to you about sh--, too.

32:34.604 --> 32:35.736
I am going to go approach her.

32:35.736 --> 32:37.346
- It just needs to stop.
- Hmm.

32:39.087 --> 32:40.262
How are they? Good?
Happy?

32:40.262 --> 32:42.003
Hungover.
Just [bleep].

32:43.439 --> 32:44.397
Here you go, lovely.

32:44.397 --> 32:45.572
Oh, thank you.

32:45.572 --> 32:47.835
Deck crew, deck crew.
Anchor up.

32:51.404 --> 32:52.927
<i>Anchor at home.</i>

32:52.927 --> 32:53.841
Thank you, Max.

32:53.841 --> 32:55.277
Thank you very much, Captain.

32:56.887 --> 32:58.367
It was so good.

32:58.367 --> 32:59.629
We did it.

32:59.629 --> 33:00.804
We'’re officially worn out.

33:02.676 --> 33:04.983
I'’m coming to you again quickly.

33:04.983 --> 33:05.984
What?

33:08.595 --> 33:09.988
Honestly, I just skimmed.

33:16.298 --> 33:19.084
Are you talking about this one?

33:19.084 --> 33:20.433
Yeah.

33:20.433 --> 33:22.348
This was just because
of the panic attack.

33:22.348 --> 33:23.479
And you weren'’t there.

33:25.394 --> 33:27.614
From her point of view, the last
interaction she had with him

33:27.614 --> 33:29.964
is him attacking her.

33:29.964 --> 33:33.272
So seeing that message
naturally would insinuate,

33:33.272 --> 33:35.622
okay, this is against me.

33:35.622 --> 33:37.450
We need to nip this in the bud.

33:37.450 --> 33:38.712
Do you know what happened
in that room?

33:38.712 --> 33:39.800
- No.
- Okay, so when I came to say,

33:39.800 --> 33:41.280
please don'’t let anyone in,

33:41.280 --> 33:43.282
it'’s because he was having
a full-on panic attack.

33:43.282 --> 33:46.459
He just kept being like, I can'’t
take on everyone'’s issues,

33:46.459 --> 33:48.113
like hearing about
Nat and the boyfriend.

33:48.113 --> 33:50.376
So I don'’t think this
was targeted at you.

33:50.376 --> 33:51.638
Does it make you feel better?

33:51.638 --> 33:52.639
I don'’t want to be
in that group.

33:52.639 --> 33:54.075
- You don'’t?
- No.

33:54.075 --> 33:55.946
You don'’t have to.
It'’s just for work.

33:55.946 --> 33:57.818
It'’s not meant to be like
some friendship group.

33:59.385 --> 34:00.429
The boat is going so fast.

34:00.429 --> 34:02.083
We have to pack.

34:02.083 --> 34:06.131
Would you mind opening
the hatch down the bottom?

34:06.131 --> 34:07.697
Right now?

34:07.697 --> 34:08.872
Yeah, I'’m just going to put
it out a little bit.

34:08.872 --> 34:10.787
- Hi, baby.
- How are you?

34:10.787 --> 34:11.745
Oh.

34:18.273 --> 34:20.014
When did she say this?

34:34.289 --> 34:36.117
No, but listen, listen, listen.

34:40.121 --> 34:41.557
So what is it?

34:41.557 --> 34:43.429
So she was speaking to her.

34:48.086 --> 34:49.565
This is Natalya.

34:49.565 --> 34:51.872
This is what Natalya is about.

34:51.872 --> 34:54.135
She loves to poke her nose
in other people'’s business

34:54.135 --> 34:56.311
and think that she knows better.

34:56.311 --> 34:59.575
And I'’m like, more understanding
and sympathetic to Jess.

34:59.575 --> 35:02.056
Natalya, stay in your lane.

35:02.056 --> 35:04.711
Oh, her side of
the version story.

35:04.711 --> 35:05.755
It'’s going to come
out of your mouth.

35:05.755 --> 35:07.409
I'’m not saying sh--

35:07.409 --> 35:09.759
<i>Genoa pilot, we are
one mile off shore.</i>

35:11.805 --> 35:13.894
Understood, we'’ll hold
our position.

35:13.894 --> 35:15.156
There we go.

35:15.156 --> 35:16.636
I'’m ready to go.

35:16.636 --> 35:19.465
Interior, Luka, in
about five minutes,

35:19.465 --> 35:22.120
could we get some hands,
maybe Cheffy as well,

35:22.120 --> 35:23.121
<i>just on the fenders?</i>

35:23.121 --> 35:24.122
<i>It'’s going to be tight.</i>

35:24.122 --> 35:25.862
Copy.

35:25.862 --> 35:27.821
Once we'’ve got the pilot on,
we'’ll do our straight back

35:27.821 --> 35:30.215
heaving lines and get that
fender ready to go over.

35:30.215 --> 35:33.653
- And Adios, senoritas.
- Adios.

35:33.653 --> 35:35.568
Here he is.
It'’s coming in hot.

35:35.568 --> 35:37.222
It'’s the pilot boat,
four meters off.

35:37.222 --> 35:39.354
- Ciao.
- Hey, ciao.

35:39.354 --> 35:42.140
There'’s the pilot on board
and the pilot boat away.

35:43.315 --> 35:44.403
Hello. Hi.

35:44.403 --> 35:45.621
Hi.

35:45.621 --> 35:47.928
- Hi, Jessie.
- What'’s happening?

35:47.928 --> 35:49.930
If you'’re okay,
you and I can have

35:49.930 --> 35:52.280
a private little
chat-a-roo later.

35:52.280 --> 35:55.762
I want to hear you, from A
to Z, come to a solution.

35:55.762 --> 35:57.894
I think as soon as
the guests are off.

35:57.894 --> 35:59.418
Okay.

35:59.418 --> 36:00.810
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

36:03.639 --> 36:05.424
What'’s up?
Look at you, mate.

36:05.424 --> 36:06.903
- Looking fly.
- Yas, queen.

36:06.903 --> 36:08.557
It'’ll be quite tight
on this side.

36:08.557 --> 36:10.429
- Okay. On this side.
- Jumping on this side.

36:10.429 --> 36:11.604
Just check a fender each.

36:11.604 --> 36:12.866
- Yes, boss.
- Thank you.

36:12.866 --> 36:14.259
I'’m training for deck.

36:14.259 --> 36:15.651
Just call distances.

36:15.651 --> 36:17.566
I'’m moving to the port side.
Port side.

36:17.566 --> 36:19.525
Copy.
We'’re pretty much in position.

36:19.525 --> 36:21.788
We can start coming back.

36:21.788 --> 36:23.616
We'’ve got 10 meters to
the small floating dock.

36:23.616 --> 36:25.792
If we could just come
to port a little bit.

36:25.792 --> 36:29.752
This is a tight slip, but at
this point, I trust the crew.

36:29.752 --> 36:31.189
How'’s it looking
there, clearing?

36:31.189 --> 36:32.886
Good.
Like 10 feet.

36:32.886 --> 36:34.366
I feel like Luka'’s
in work mode.

36:34.366 --> 36:37.456
It'’s incredible how
far they'’ve all come.

36:37.456 --> 36:39.153
<i>Two meters, port side quarter.</i>

36:39.153 --> 36:42.243
<i>We'’re going with lines.
One meter from the dock.</i>

36:42.243 --> 36:44.202
<i>How are those
ground lines looking?</i>

36:44.202 --> 36:45.594
We'’re on line, attached.

36:45.594 --> 36:46.595
Nice.

36:46.595 --> 36:47.640
<i>We'’re looking good.</i>

36:47.640 --> 36:48.771
Passarelle is out.

36:48.771 --> 36:50.251
<i>Nice job.
Well done.</i>

36:50.251 --> 36:51.252
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

36:51.252 --> 36:52.819
I'’m very proud of my team.

36:52.819 --> 36:54.821
They'’ve really come together
and stayed focused

36:54.821 --> 36:56.301
while Sandy was off the boat.

36:56.301 --> 36:58.346
And it makes me happy
because it makes me look good.

36:58.346 --> 37:00.609
And if I look good,
then Sandy'’s happy.

37:00.609 --> 37:02.698
Let'’s go.
Let'’s get into our whites.

37:04.047 --> 37:06.441
Ew. How do I always get
dirty as [bleep]?

37:06.441 --> 37:08.704
Am I the last one again?

37:08.704 --> 37:10.489
We'’re going to line
up like this.

37:10.489 --> 37:13.318
I can'’t be shaking hands.
Today'’s a hugging session.

37:13.318 --> 37:14.797
I'’m going to cry.

37:14.797 --> 37:16.799
Thank you so much.
It was so nice to meet you.

37:18.497 --> 37:20.325
- Bye.
- Bye.

37:20.325 --> 37:21.500
- I'’ll miss you.
- You, too.

37:21.500 --> 37:22.936
- Food was amazing.
- Thank you.

37:22.936 --> 37:24.285
Thank you for everything
I asked for.

37:24.285 --> 37:25.808
I don'’t know how
you guys handled us.

37:25.808 --> 37:26.896
We were frickin'’ nuts.

37:26.896 --> 37:28.420
So thank you so much.

37:28.420 --> 37:31.466
All of the decor, everything,
top notch, beautiful.

37:31.466 --> 37:32.728
It was so fun.

37:32.728 --> 37:34.295
So I have a little
something for you.

37:34.295 --> 37:36.602
Here you go.

37:36.602 --> 37:37.603
- Thank you.
- Thank you, guys, everyone.

37:37.603 --> 37:39.387
I'’ll miss you. Bye.

37:39.387 --> 37:40.780
- Bye.
- Oh, God.

37:40.780 --> 37:41.998
All right. Out of your
whites, into your reds.

37:41.998 --> 37:43.348
Let'’s turn the boat around,

37:43.348 --> 37:45.088
and then we'’ll meet
for our tip meeting.

37:45.088 --> 37:46.742
Thank you, Cap.

37:48.527 --> 37:50.224
Let'’s not do that again.

37:52.922 --> 37:54.315
Done, mate.
Charter'’s done.

37:54.315 --> 37:56.143
Tired, man.

37:57.275 --> 37:58.798
Um, last night,
when I was at the table.

37:58.798 --> 38:00.190
I had a shot with
the guests, yeah.

38:00.190 --> 38:01.801
I think you'’ll be
all right, mate.

38:01.801 --> 38:03.324
Am I just going to mention
it anyway, to be honest?

38:03.324 --> 38:04.499
It'’s probably a good idea.

38:04.499 --> 38:05.544
Let'’s have our last night.

38:05.544 --> 38:06.632
Is she in the bridge now?

38:06.632 --> 38:07.807
She'’ll come into the bridge.

38:10.157 --> 38:11.289
Hello, Captain.

38:11.289 --> 38:12.681
Got a minute
for a little talk, please.

38:12.681 --> 38:14.117
- Yes, of course.
- I'’ll go in the bridge.

38:14.117 --> 38:15.336
Okay.

38:19.427 --> 38:21.081
Yeah, I----ed up a
little bit last night.

38:21.081 --> 38:22.300
What?

38:22.300 --> 38:23.953
I had a shot with
the guests at the table.

38:23.953 --> 38:25.390
I just want you to know before.

38:25.390 --> 38:26.652
Okay.

38:26.652 --> 38:29.263
- But, that'’s it.
- Pack your sh--.

38:29.263 --> 38:31.483
- Yeah.
- No.

38:31.483 --> 38:33.398
No, I wanted you to know,
so my mind'’s clear,

38:33.398 --> 38:34.573
you know what I mean?

38:34.573 --> 38:36.009
I don'’t even like shots.

38:36.009 --> 38:37.402
When we go out,
I never have them.

38:37.402 --> 38:38.968
But they were just
like, ah, just, just.

38:38.968 --> 38:40.405
- Just don'’t do it again.
- No, I won'’t.

38:40.405 --> 38:42.015
Thanks for telling me.

38:42.015 --> 38:44.017
Remember when I said
these guests, it'’ll be hard?

38:44.017 --> 38:46.106
Yeah, it was.
It was very hard.

38:46.106 --> 38:47.455
They will have you
cross the line.

38:47.455 --> 38:48.587
I will just say no for now on.

38:48.587 --> 38:50.066
He knows he made a mistake.

38:50.066 --> 38:51.372
- Don'’t do it again.
- I won'’t.

38:51.372 --> 38:52.982
- Thank you for telling me.
- No worries.

38:52.982 --> 38:55.898
I admire his honesty.
I'’m glad he admitted it.

38:55.898 --> 38:57.552
And we'’re just going to move on.

38:57.552 --> 38:59.598
He knows better.
I like him.

38:59.598 --> 39:02.035
Okay, we need
to strip the beds.

39:02.035 --> 39:04.037
- Towels, covers.
- Towels.

39:04.037 --> 39:06.779
I'’m going to put all this
sh-- on from here.

39:06.779 --> 39:08.868
Do you want to do cabins
with me quickly?

39:08.868 --> 39:10.217
Are you comfortable
with that or not?

39:10.217 --> 39:12.132
- Do cabins?
- Yeah, with Kyle.

39:12.132 --> 39:13.394
Yeah.

39:13.394 --> 39:15.396
I want to hear Kyle out.

39:15.396 --> 39:17.311
I'’m ready to speak to him.

39:17.311 --> 39:18.791
So just stripping.

39:18.791 --> 39:19.879
- Yeah.
- And towels.

39:19.879 --> 39:23.099
- Stripping, towels.
- Trash.

39:26.407 --> 39:27.930
Okay, let'’s see.

39:33.283 --> 39:35.024
Should I go first?

39:44.991 --> 39:46.949
Okay, so I think I told Tumi

39:46.949 --> 39:50.388
that Kyle makes me feel
like a green stew.

39:50.388 --> 39:54.174
But when I said that,
I was like,

39:54.174 --> 39:55.871
I never meant it in
a malicious way.

39:55.871 --> 39:58.918
And I think after
you speaking to me,

39:58.918 --> 40:00.876
it makes me realize
that I really need to

40:00.876 --> 40:02.704
just like think
before I say something

40:02.704 --> 40:04.663
because it could come off wrong.

40:04.663 --> 40:08.536
So I am sorry for telling Tumi
and not telling you that.

40:08.536 --> 40:11.409
Can I be honest, if Natalya was
the one running her mouth,

40:11.409 --> 40:13.541
for example, like was done,
I'’d be like, typical.

40:13.541 --> 40:14.890
I expected it.

40:14.890 --> 40:16.414
So I was the only
one standing up for you.

40:16.414 --> 40:19.155
You can stand up,
Natalya, standing up for you.

40:19.155 --> 40:21.941
That'’s your own way,
you'’ll see things your own time.

40:21.941 --> 40:23.072
That'’s what I'm saying.

40:23.072 --> 40:25.466
I know, I think I'’m already...

40:25.466 --> 40:26.815
Okay.

40:26.815 --> 40:28.469
I woke up this morning,
and she asked me,

40:28.469 --> 40:29.470
did you read the text?

40:29.470 --> 40:30.906
I'’m like.

40:30.906 --> 40:32.604
So do you understand
what I'’m trying to say?

40:32.604 --> 40:37.391
That'’s exactly when I literally,
that'’s what I'm seeing.

40:37.391 --> 40:41.961
After that whole conversation
about me being on service...

40:41.961 --> 40:43.919
Should we talk about
how Tumi and Jess

40:43.919 --> 40:46.487
are going to
run service this charter?

40:47.880 --> 40:49.272
I didn'’t take it personally.

40:49.272 --> 40:52.232
But then once Natalya
questions the laugh,

40:52.232 --> 40:53.929
I start questioning the laugh.

40:53.929 --> 40:56.454
So laughing, I was like,
bitch, we ran this without you

40:56.454 --> 40:57.759
for like a couple of days.

40:57.759 --> 41:00.066
No, literally,
I was like, why'’d she laugh?

41:00.066 --> 41:02.285
Kyle texted our interior group,

41:02.285 --> 41:04.766
and she says,
did you read the text?

41:04.766 --> 41:06.681
See the current message?

41:06.681 --> 41:07.856
What?

41:07.856 --> 41:09.510
Bottom bit, hon.

41:09.510 --> 41:10.946
It'’s honestly bullying.

41:10.946 --> 41:12.687
It'’s like manipulating.

41:12.687 --> 41:15.473
I wouldn'’t have second guessed
a text like that

41:15.473 --> 41:18.171
if she didn'’t make
me think about it.

41:18.171 --> 41:21.957
I feel Natalya is
the core of the drama.

41:21.957 --> 41:25.352
She knows the weak links.

41:25.352 --> 41:29.356
And she uses that
to stir the pot.

41:31.532 --> 41:34.709
From my side, I want to
apologize for my approach.

41:34.709 --> 41:36.624
And I understand how
triggering that was for you.

41:36.624 --> 41:39.192
I'’ve been the one that
was thrown in the bin

41:39.192 --> 41:41.020
during my primary
and high school.

41:41.020 --> 41:42.412
I'’ve been there.

41:42.412 --> 41:44.284
- Kyle, I'’m so sorry.
- I'’m also.

41:44.284 --> 41:46.416
Like, truly, from my heart.

41:46.416 --> 41:48.984
Can I give you a hug?

41:55.382 --> 41:57.297
- Yeah.
- So then we got this.

41:57.297 --> 41:58.428
Yeah.

41:58.428 --> 41:59.691
Anyway, I'’m going
to get bin bags.

41:59.691 --> 42:00.692
Thanks for the chat-a-roo.

42:00.692 --> 42:01.910
I love you.

42:01.910 --> 42:03.564
And just a fair warning.

42:03.564 --> 42:06.480
And it'’s not me being like,
I'’m like, watch out.

42:06.480 --> 42:07.525
I know.

42:07.525 --> 42:08.656
Okay, that'’s what I'm saying.

42:08.656 --> 42:09.918
I realize that today.

42:09.918 --> 42:11.093
Okay.

42:12.225 --> 42:13.531
Where do you want these, here?

42:13.531 --> 42:15.924
On the sun lounger.

42:17.230 --> 42:18.536
<i>All crew, all crew.</i>

42:18.536 --> 42:20.450
Let'’s meet in
the bridge deck salon

42:20.450 --> 42:21.277
for our tip meeting.

42:21.277 --> 42:23.236
Copy for us interior, Cap.

42:23.236 --> 42:24.237
Woo!

42:30.722 --> 42:35.117
All right, so this was a
bizarre charter for the crew.

42:35.117 --> 42:36.510
And when I was away,

42:36.510 --> 42:39.034
you guys maintained
the professionalism.

42:39.034 --> 42:40.688
So thank you for that.

42:40.688 --> 42:42.385
There'’s a flip side to this.

42:42.385 --> 42:44.474
I always said that
these guests would push you

42:44.474 --> 42:45.693
to cross the line.

42:45.693 --> 42:47.303
How many people were tempted?

42:47.303 --> 42:50.263
Superyacht people
don'’t cross the line,

42:50.263 --> 42:51.612
no matter how tempted.

42:51.612 --> 42:54.528
So please maintain
that professionalism.

42:54.528 --> 42:57.313
You know, because
we'’re doing so well,

42:57.313 --> 43:00.186
I took on a charter
for tomorrow.

43:03.102 --> 43:05.626
So it'’s a 24-hour turnaround.

43:05.626 --> 43:07.759
Oh, Christ.

43:07.759 --> 43:09.325
Just kidding.

43:09.325 --> 43:10.979
Cap, I'’m literally!

43:12.198 --> 43:13.634
- Tomorrow...
- Please...

43:13.634 --> 43:16.158
The owners arranged
a day off for you.

43:16.158 --> 43:17.899
You have the day off
to go have some fun.

43:17.899 --> 43:18.900
That'’s the tip for me.

43:18.900 --> 43:20.075
Blow off some steam.

43:20.075 --> 43:22.295
So this one is still a good tip.

43:22.295 --> 43:24.253
- $20,000.
- That'’s good.

43:24.253 --> 43:26.429
Okay.
1,400 euros per person.

43:26.429 --> 43:28.910
- That'’s good.
- Cool.

43:28.910 --> 43:31.478
- ed.
- yes.

43:31.478 --> 43:33.915
I'’m really excited
for this day off.

43:33.915 --> 43:35.525
Slick as [bleep].

43:35.525 --> 43:36.744
Cheers!

43:36.744 --> 43:38.746
- Cheers everyone.
- Here'’s to your day off,

43:38.746 --> 43:40.008
and no charter tomorrow.

43:40.008 --> 43:41.096
That'’s amazing.

43:41.096 --> 43:43.316
Who'’s gonna get...

43:43.316 --> 43:44.839
Thank you.
Have fun.

43:44.839 --> 43:46.232
Thank you.

43:57.678 --> 43:59.593
Is this yours?

44:02.770 --> 44:04.467
I'’m trying to clean your mess.

44:06.165 --> 44:07.993
Do you think our mom'’s
would have been friends?

44:07.993 --> 44:09.995
Yeah,----ing 100%.

44:11.649 --> 44:12.998
Oh, bitch.

44:12.998 --> 44:15.609
How'’s it going?

44:15.609 --> 44:17.306
I'’m ready.
Are you?

44:17.306 --> 44:18.525
- No, I'’m not.
- You look ready.

44:18.525 --> 44:19.961
Nice shirt.

44:19.961 --> 44:21.615
You look good, too.

44:21.615 --> 44:22.703
Thank you.

44:22.703 --> 44:23.965
I love your fit.

44:23.965 --> 44:25.053
What do you think of this?

44:25.053 --> 44:26.402
I think it'’s cute.

44:26.402 --> 44:28.491
- We'’re out of here.
- Let'’s go.

44:28.491 --> 44:29.971
I'’m going to get
blackout wasted tonight.

44:29.971 --> 44:31.016
Yeah.

44:31.016 --> 44:32.234
You know what?

44:32.234 --> 44:33.583
Wow, we'’re going so far.

44:33.583 --> 44:35.934
Yay!

44:35.934 --> 44:39.154
- What do you want to drink?
- Do you have spicy margarita?

44:39.154 --> 44:41.461
Can I please have tequila,
water, cucumber?

44:41.461 --> 44:44.029
You'’re such a basic-ass
white girl.

44:44.029 --> 44:46.466
- Yeah.
- Just kidding.

44:46.466 --> 44:49.512
So, did you get close
with any of the girls?

44:49.512 --> 44:52.646
Leni, look at this.
Leni?

44:52.646 --> 44:56.171
These are the nipples are
the eyes of the breasts.

44:56.171 --> 44:58.913
The nipples are the eyes
of the breasts, yeah.

44:58.913 --> 45:02.003
Hello, boo.

45:02.003 --> 45:03.526
We have no water.

45:03.526 --> 45:05.093
You'’re so observant, Jess.

45:05.093 --> 45:07.313
Bro, are you sure?

45:07.313 --> 45:09.358
Cheers to you guys.

45:09.358 --> 45:10.533
Cheers!

45:10.533 --> 45:11.491
Genuinely.

45:11.491 --> 45:12.927
Excuse me, can you
just get,

45:12.927 --> 45:15.625
like, a decent meal in
so we don'’t have any?

45:15.625 --> 45:18.541
I'’ll try.
No promises.

45:18.541 --> 45:19.717
Thank you.

45:20.979 --> 45:23.024
Oh, my God, yes.

45:23.024 --> 45:24.504
So far, so far, what was

45:24.504 --> 45:26.332
your most challenging
charter for yourself?

45:26.332 --> 45:27.637
You don'’t need to give a reason.

45:27.637 --> 45:29.335
Was it number one, two,
three, or four?

45:29.335 --> 45:30.858
Charter one because
we slept literally between us

45:30.858 --> 45:32.294
- three hours.
- And yours?

45:32.294 --> 45:34.427
This one was mine.

45:34.427 --> 45:36.690
This was the worst charter
in my history of chartering.

45:36.690 --> 45:38.126
It was a lot.
It was always a lot.

45:38.126 --> 45:39.649
Honey.

45:39.649 --> 45:41.956
But hey, we can only be
positive for these next ones.

45:41.956 --> 45:44.132
Yeah, I'’m glad that
we'’re like together again.

45:44.132 --> 45:45.786
I really appreciate
your authenticity.

45:45.786 --> 45:48.049
- You, too.
- Honestly.

45:48.049 --> 45:49.485
Yeah.

45:49.485 --> 45:51.313
And to be honest, you look
so much more happy.

45:51.313 --> 45:54.403
You can see that.
You can see that.

45:54.403 --> 45:57.319
I must commend Tumi.
She was like a calm mediator.

45:57.319 --> 45:58.930
She understood that we
both needed space.

45:58.930 --> 46:01.889
She understood Kyle needed
to be away from guests.

46:01.889 --> 46:03.761
So thank you for understanding.

46:03.761 --> 46:07.155
- I'’m like...
- Want to smooch?

46:07.155 --> 46:08.853
You know, the trio.

46:08.853 --> 46:10.898
The new three best friends I'’ve
seen at the end of the table.

46:10.898 --> 46:12.682
Team Interior, Positivity.

46:12.682 --> 46:15.294
And like, oh, I'’m so glad.
And yes, Hot Queen.

46:15.294 --> 46:16.643
Oh, you look so hot, babe.

46:16.643 --> 46:19.515
And like, oh,
it just does my head in.

46:19.515 --> 46:21.343
Like, these are
the most ungenuine people

46:21.343 --> 46:22.910
I'’ve ever met in my life.

46:22.910 --> 46:24.172
That'’s pretty good, though.

46:26.479 --> 46:28.698
You getting a drink?

46:28.698 --> 46:30.613
And one...

46:34.008 --> 46:35.793
Do you want a drink?

46:35.793 --> 46:37.359
Okay, it'’s okay.

46:37.359 --> 46:40.406
- No, thank you.
- You don'’t want a drink?

46:44.410 --> 46:45.933
Where are you going?

46:45.933 --> 46:48.240
What'’s wrong, Natalya?

46:51.809 --> 46:53.114
Coming up...

46:53.114 --> 46:55.203
Kyle, I'’ve never been
spoken to in my life.

46:55.203 --> 46:57.249
I can'’t believe
you'’re saying this.

46:57.249 --> 46:58.816
That just spoke volumes
about our friendship.

46:58.816 --> 47:00.121
I don'’t give a
about our friendship.

47:00.121 --> 47:01.819
Our friendship'’s
never been real,

47:01.819 --> 47:03.472
you'’ve been a fake-ass bitch
talking sh-- behind my back

47:03.472 --> 47:04.778
since day one.

47:08.826 --> 47:11.306
Alright, guys, I have to go
back for a few minutes,

47:11.306 --> 47:12.655
but I might come at you
on the next bar.

47:12.655 --> 47:15.310
- Where are you going?
- What'’s wrong?

47:19.924 --> 47:21.577
Hi, my love.

47:22.927 --> 47:25.581
Oh, I'’ve just been,
this has been a stressful week,

47:25.581 --> 47:28.019
so it'’s just built up.

47:28.019 --> 47:30.586
And I was left in it early.
Everyone'’s gone out.

47:30.586 --> 47:32.850
What are you doing?
It sounds like you'’re out.

47:38.333 --> 47:40.248
Oh, babe.
I don'’t know.

47:40.248 --> 47:41.902
I just feel home sick, eh?

47:41.902 --> 47:45.906
Like, do you know when it
just doesn'’t feel... good?

47:45.906 --> 47:48.604
I just can'’t deal with
what'’s going on, on the way,

47:48.604 --> 47:50.171
like, on board right now.

47:50.171 --> 47:53.261
Like, the interior is the
most fakest----ing interior

47:53.261 --> 47:54.393
I'’ve ever worked with.

47:54.393 --> 47:55.873
I just don'’t know what to do.

47:55.873 --> 47:59.093
One minute I'’m like,
yep, you can do this.

47:59.093 --> 48:01.356
And then I'’m like, no, I can't.

48:08.973 --> 48:10.191
It'’s already after.

48:10.191 --> 48:11.627
Are you calling Amanda?
You can play games.

48:11.627 --> 48:13.194
Oh, she'’s online.
She'’s online.

48:13.194 --> 48:17.982
Amanda? We'’re going to the bar
right next to the boat.

48:19.418 --> 48:21.507
They are stoked, guys.

48:21.507 --> 48:23.944
Guys, guys,
they'’re----ing stoked.

48:23.944 --> 48:25.250
What'’s happened to Natalya,
do you know?

48:25.250 --> 48:26.468
No.

48:26.468 --> 48:28.122
Alright, I love you. Bye.

48:28.122 --> 48:30.516
I can party with the girls now,
but I can'’t work with the girls.

48:30.516 --> 48:32.039
No, the girls were a lot.

48:32.039 --> 48:33.258
Does it make sense
what I'’m saying?

48:33.258 --> 48:34.259
- Yes, it does.
- Yeah.

48:34.259 --> 48:35.782
Bravo.

48:35.782 --> 48:38.132
We'’re going to need
more chairs for the girls.

48:38.132 --> 48:40.656
Sit on us.

48:40.656 --> 48:42.397
I'’m just going to have my
one moment and I'’m done.

48:43.268 --> 48:44.660
Me and Natalya.

48:44.660 --> 48:46.967
She'’s been like this
for such a long time.

48:46.967 --> 48:48.838
She'’s so aggressive.

48:48.838 --> 48:51.102
- Sh-- stirring.
- It'’s not a real...

48:51.102 --> 48:54.540
And it'’s like, I don't want
that toxicity around me.

48:57.891 --> 49:00.894
Because there'’s so many
people turning against me...

49:04.202 --> 49:07.466
- Oh!
- Oh!

49:21.045 --> 49:23.699
Now the tables are turned.

49:23.699 --> 49:25.832
Now you guys have to
buy us drinks.

49:31.620 --> 49:33.840
I could hear you guys
a mile away.

49:33.840 --> 49:37.235
I was like...
they'’re down the dock.

49:37.235 --> 49:40.020
Can I have a drag?
Thank you. That'’s my girl.

49:43.067 --> 49:44.938
What are you doing?

49:44.938 --> 49:46.026
Where did you go?

49:46.026 --> 49:46.853
Huh?

49:46.853 --> 49:47.897
Where did you run off to?

49:47.897 --> 49:49.029
I didn'’t run off anywhere.

49:49.029 --> 49:50.726
You did.
To the boat.

49:50.726 --> 49:51.901
What do you mean? I told you
I had to go do something.

49:51.901 --> 49:52.772
Do what?

49:52.772 --> 49:55.035
- Business.
- Business, okay.

49:55.035 --> 49:57.733
- What kind of shot do you want?
- Maybe.

49:57.733 --> 49:58.952
You won'’t have a shot with me?

49:58.952 --> 50:00.258
No.

50:00.258 --> 50:02.042
Luka has just suddenly
gone super cold on me.

50:02.042 --> 50:04.044
Like, I am very good
at sensing the vibes.

50:04.044 --> 50:07.004
I feel like it'’s very
icy vibes towards me.

50:07.004 --> 50:10.572
I was very afraid of you
to whip out your laptop.

50:10.572 --> 50:12.748
- Hey, up two.
- Hey, up two.

50:14.185 --> 50:16.404
We don'’t have to wake up
tomorrow, right?

50:16.404 --> 50:19.364
We'’ve got to wake up eventually.

50:19.364 --> 50:21.279
- We can sleep in.
- I----ed up again.

50:21.279 --> 50:22.541
Yeah!

50:31.463 --> 50:32.855
Me, too.

50:37.382 --> 50:38.948
Ay, yi, yi, madame.

50:38.948 --> 50:40.428
Okay, okay, Nat.

50:40.428 --> 50:41.647
Nat.

50:42.474 --> 50:43.910
Yeah.

50:43.910 --> 50:47.218
- Yeah, I was.
- And then?

50:47.218 --> 50:48.306
Holy sh--.

50:48.306 --> 50:51.091
This is going to end badly.

50:52.832 --> 50:55.269
My boyfriend will love this.

50:55.269 --> 50:58.794
- Can I pee?
- Yes.

50:58.794 --> 50:59.839
Ow!

50:59.839 --> 51:01.449
I like spirituality.
I am Jewish.

51:01.449 --> 51:02.581
I'’m Jewish.

51:02.581 --> 51:05.410
What? Mazel tov!

51:05.410 --> 51:07.107
Whoa!

51:11.285 --> 51:12.591
Let me have my drink first.

51:12.591 --> 51:13.766
- No.
- Come on.

51:13.766 --> 51:15.159
It'’s against the rules.

51:34.526 --> 51:36.963
Are you mad at me?
Are we in a fight?

51:39.879 --> 51:42.099
Lara, I love.
Shut up.

51:46.755 --> 51:48.148
The charm, I got.

51:48.148 --> 51:51.238
Those straight ladies
can'’t resist this.

51:57.114 --> 51:59.594
I get fun drunk.

51:59.594 --> 52:01.770
I'’m fun.

52:05.209 --> 52:07.124
We'’re packing up.

52:07.124 --> 52:08.473
Love you so much.

52:08.473 --> 52:10.214
- Bye, you lesbians.
- Bye.

52:10.214 --> 52:12.259
- The pleasure.
- Yes.

52:12.259 --> 52:15.001
You can come visit me as well.

52:15.001 --> 52:16.263
You know, Romeo and Juliet.

52:16.263 --> 52:19.484
We are 2.0, you know.

52:19.484 --> 52:21.573
Your eyes, I tell you.

52:25.272 --> 52:26.230
Damn.

52:30.364 --> 52:33.280
We'’re ready.

52:33.280 --> 52:34.281
Finally.

52:34.281 --> 52:35.543
I love you, bro.

52:35.543 --> 52:38.242
Did you have
a good night so far?

52:43.203 --> 52:44.552
Seriously.

52:44.552 --> 52:45.901
I speak only to Leni.

52:45.901 --> 52:48.948
I'’m putting my entire
season of money.

52:48.948 --> 52:52.081
You and Leni
will never work out.

52:52.081 --> 52:54.606
You'’re 23.

52:54.606 --> 52:56.129
She'’s a grown businesswoman.

52:56.129 --> 52:58.740
She is, bro.

53:00.829 --> 53:03.789
My lawyer is going to speak.

53:03.789 --> 53:06.095
For me, I'’m okay.
I'’m engaged.

53:11.710 --> 53:13.538
What'’s S?

53:13.538 --> 53:15.627
No, baby. Don'’t, no.

53:21.285 --> 53:22.721
- Me?
- Yeah.

53:30.294 --> 53:31.208
Yeah.

53:33.166 --> 53:35.777
LGBTQIA+ does not include
straight individual.

53:35.777 --> 53:37.823
Not even ally is
within our acronym.

53:37.823 --> 53:39.564
That'’s our thing.

53:39.564 --> 53:41.000
I accept your ally-ship.

53:41.000 --> 53:42.784
But I do not accept you saying

53:42.784 --> 53:45.134
that you'’re part
of the LGBTQIA community.

53:53.969 --> 53:56.189
Okay. Would you have
an Eiffel Tower with a girl?

53:56.189 --> 53:58.626
- Bro, I don'’t care.
- He'’s bi-curious.

53:58.626 --> 54:00.889
- So that equals...
- Bi-curious.

54:00.889 --> 54:02.978
There'’s two guys,
one girl bi-curious.

54:02.978 --> 54:05.198
- Nat.
- Playing with the other gender.

54:05.198 --> 54:06.417
Nat...

54:06.417 --> 54:08.027
Kyle, a part of a community
is supposed

54:08.027 --> 54:09.507
to be accepted by
every community.

54:09.507 --> 54:10.899
- Not you. Not you.
- Okay.

54:10.899 --> 54:12.640
Take a back seat.

54:12.640 --> 54:14.076
There'’s nothing to do with you.
There'’s got to do with him.

54:14.076 --> 54:15.687
Don'’t tell me to
take a back seat.

54:15.687 --> 54:17.297
I'’m one of your friends.
Don'’t talk to me like that.

54:17.297 --> 54:18.559
I will talk to you the
way I want to, honey.

54:18.559 --> 54:19.778
You don'’t control me, ever.

54:20.822 --> 54:22.171
- Kyle.
- You will never...

54:22.171 --> 54:23.695
- Kyle, take a water.
- ...control me.

54:23.695 --> 54:25.479
Take a water.
You need to accept people.

54:25.479 --> 54:27.612
You will never control me.

54:27.612 --> 54:33.008
I don'’t need you to control
everybody'’s opinion about...

54:33.008 --> 54:35.489
Focus on your own
- ed up life

54:35.489 --> 54:37.491
before you [bleep] up on ours.

54:37.491 --> 54:38.710
Yes, you have.

54:38.710 --> 54:40.189
She will throw you under
the----ing bus.

54:40.189 --> 54:41.495
- I'’ve never done that.
- She will do it to you.

54:41.495 --> 54:43.105
- Not, me.
- You'’ll see.

54:43.105 --> 54:44.716
Kyle, I'’ve never been
spoken to like that in my life.

54:44.716 --> 54:47.327
I can'’t believe that
actually, you'’re saying this.

54:47.327 --> 54:49.024
Kyle, that just spoke
volumes about our friendship.

54:49.024 --> 54:50.199
I don'’t give a
about our friendship.

54:50.199 --> 54:51.418
Our friendships'’
never been real.

54:51.418 --> 54:52.811
You'’ve been a fake-ass bitch

54:52.811 --> 54:54.334
talking sh-- behind my
back since day one.

54:54.334 --> 54:56.336
- Get away from me.
- Kyle, chill.

54:56.336 --> 54:59.339
What the actual
is wrong with him?

54:59.339 --> 55:00.993
That was horrible.
