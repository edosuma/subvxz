08:24.240 --> 08:25.440
(Gina)
I hate grackles.

08:25.441 --> 08:26.808
They're the worst.

08:26.843 --> 08:30.345
Well, a lot of people think
grackles are just a common bird

08:30.346 --> 08:31.546
up here,
but you know what?

08:31.547 --> 08:33.615
On the West Coast
they don't get grackles.

08:33.650 --> 08:36.618
Can you give some more info

08:36.619 --> 08:38.886
for a novice bird watcher
such as myself?

08:38.922 --> 08:40.422
You have got to know
the difference

08:40.423 --> 08:41.823
between your water birds.

08:41.857 --> 08:43.859
I mean, so many people
don't know the difference

08:43.860 --> 08:46.995
between an anhinga and a snake
bird and a swamp hawk.

08:47.030 --> 08:51.300
A lot of people don't know
they're all the same bird.

08:51.334 --> 08:53.001
Are those the ones
that sound like Rihanna

08:53.002 --> 08:54.503
kind of when they sing?

08:54.504 --> 08:56.371
I'm not familiar
with who that is.

08:56.406 --> 08:57.773
They're like, "Eh, eh."

08:57.774 --> 09:00.676
That sounds like that might be
a crested woodpecker.

09:00.710 --> 09:02.010
Or is it more like...
[whistles]

09:02.011 --> 09:04.413
Well,
that's a crested titmouse maybe?

09:04.447 --> 09:06.181
Oh, my God, that's it.

09:06.182 --> 09:09.217
Wayne, you are
a damn treasure trove.

09:10.753 --> 09:11.853
We got the letter.

09:11.888 --> 09:13.055
Well done.

09:13.056 --> 09:16.425
Now get me Madeline
and a bucket of water.

09:16.426 --> 09:18.860
It's time to melt a witch.

09:18.895 --> 09:20.229
(Rosa)
Who else is going?

09:20.263 --> 09:23.198
Rosa, listen to me,
there is no party.

09:23.199 --> 09:24.833
Just get off my doughnut
already.

09:24.867 --> 09:26.435
Don't lie to me, Boyle,

09:26.436 --> 09:28.937
or you will be eating your bone
marrow custard through a straw.

09:28.972 --> 09:30.706
That's exactly how you're
supposed to eat bone marrow...

09:30.707 --> 09:31.974
- Charles!
- Ah!

09:31.975 --> 09:33.055
All right, there's a party.

09:33.076 --> 09:34.276
I can't give you details.

09:34.310 --> 09:35.677
All I can say is I know you,

09:35.678 --> 09:37.045
and I know you'll have
a good time.

09:37.080 --> 09:39.381
If you knew me, you'd know
I hate surprise parties,

09:39.382 --> 09:42.050
so clearly
you don't know me at all.

09:42.085 --> 09:44.286
What?
We're friends.

09:44.287 --> 09:46.822
I was building up to calling you
"Ro-ro" one of these days.

09:46.823 --> 09:48.223
That will never happen.

09:48.224 --> 09:49.925
In fact, you just lost "Rosa"
privileges.

09:49.926 --> 09:52.027
From now on, you can
call me "Diaz" or "Hey, you."

09:52.061 --> 09:53.629
Come on, Rosa.

09:53.663 --> 09:54.763
Come on, hey, you.

09:55.832 --> 09:58.534
Wow,
champagne and oysters.

09:58.535 --> 10:00.102
You really shouldn't have,
guys.

10:00.136 --> 10:01.970
Well, it's a special night.

10:01.971 --> 10:03.071
So when did you guys meet?

10:03.106 --> 10:05.007
- Last year.
- Five years ago.

10:05.008 --> 10:07.743
We first met five years ago,

10:07.744 --> 10:09.244
but we don't count it,
because...

10:09.279 --> 10:11.914
I was dating a speedboat model
at the time.

10:11.948 --> 10:14.583
And I was dating
a super handsome comptroller

10:14.584 --> 10:16.118
of a major U.S. city.

10:16.152 --> 10:18.520
Anyways, about a year ago, we
bumped into each other at a bar,

10:18.521 --> 10:21.390
and we haven't been able to keep
our hands off each other since.

10:21.424 --> 10:22.424
Mm.

10:22.425 --> 10:24.993
So how did you know
she was the one?

10:25.028 --> 10:26.328
I'd love to answer that.

10:26.362 --> 10:31.733
Um, you know, just whenever
I look at her face

10:31.768 --> 10:35.103
and the attached physique.

10:35.138 --> 10:36.572
And you?

10:36.573 --> 10:38.173
Uh...

10:40.343 --> 10:42.678
He makes me laugh.

10:42.712 --> 10:46.114
And, you know, there's really
no one else's opinion

10:46.115 --> 10:48.016
who I care about
more than hers, so...

10:49.786 --> 10:52.221
(woman) Okay, so enough chitchat
Let's see the ring.

10:53.489 --> 10:55.490
I don't have it on me.

10:55.525 --> 10:58.126
She has gigantic fingers.

10:59.696 --> 11:01.897
What I mean to say
is that the ring I got

11:01.898 --> 11:03.832
would never have fit
on her fingers,

11:03.833 --> 11:07.503
because they are that
of a giant, behemoth person.

11:07.537 --> 11:11.406
[laughter]

11:13.576 --> 11:14.977
Madeline,
thank you for coming.

11:14.978 --> 11:17.312
Raymond, always a pleasure
to call on a vanquished foe.

11:17.347 --> 11:18.914
I feel like
Jackie Joyner-Kersee

11:18.948 --> 11:20.983
congratulating one
of the other slower runners.

11:21.017 --> 11:22.017
(Terry)
Buckle up.

11:22.018 --> 11:23.652
It's gonna be
a hell of a ride.

11:23.653 --> 11:24.853
(Ray)
Care to sit?

11:24.854 --> 11:25.854
I'm sure
you'd like to take some weight

11:25.855 --> 11:27.156
off your cloven hooves.

11:27.157 --> 11:28.290
Calling me the devil?

11:28.291 --> 11:29.458
How original, Raymond.

11:29.492 --> 11:32.027
Actually I was calling
you a goat, you goat.

11:32.061 --> 11:34.863
(both)
Oh.

11:34.898 --> 11:36.532
I'd like to talk
about my promotion.

11:36.566 --> 11:37.799
Very well, but first,

11:37.800 --> 11:39.968
how do I know
you're not wearing a wire?

11:39.969 --> 11:41.103
I need to pat you down.

11:42.238 --> 11:43.272
If you must.

11:51.748 --> 11:54.216
(Terry)
What is going on?

11:54.217 --> 11:56.318
Shh.
I'm watching something.

11:56.352 --> 11:58.320
(man) Can you get the car
from the valet, babe?

11:58.354 --> 12:00.556
I'm gonna in the back
and say hi to the chef.

12:03.693 --> 12:04.993
Good luck
on your wedding, guys.

12:04.994 --> 12:07.496
Oh, have fun
on your honeymoon.

12:07.530 --> 12:09.832
We will.
We're going to Waco, Texas.

12:09.866 --> 12:12.835
Huh.
Okay, bye.

12:12.836 --> 12:14.403
Bye.

12:14.404 --> 12:15.564
- Waco, Texas?
- I don't know.

12:15.572 --> 12:17.005
It was just on <i> Dateline.</i>

12:17.006 --> 12:18.974
All right, well, Augustine took
the laptop case with him.

12:18.975 --> 12:20.642
He's gonna make the drop.
Let's go.

12:22.045 --> 12:24.313
Look, there's the buyer.

12:24.314 --> 12:26.882
Or maybe he's just actually
saying hi to the chef?

12:26.916 --> 12:28.450
Why isn't he making
the handoff?

12:28.451 --> 12:29.685
(Jake)
Oh, crap, he saw us.

12:29.719 --> 12:32.087
Uh,...

12:34.557 --> 12:35.724
Excuse me.

12:35.725 --> 12:36.859
Oh, hey.

12:36.893 --> 12:39.895
We were just looking
for a place to, uh...

12:39.896 --> 12:41.263
Boink.

12:41.264 --> 12:42.965
Yep. Boink.

12:42.966 --> 12:45.567
That's my preferred term
for it as well.

12:45.602 --> 12:46.602
I get it.

12:46.603 --> 12:48.904
Newly engaged kids.
Enjoy.

12:48.938 --> 12:51.306
Thanks.

12:53.576 --> 12:54.743
Good. Good, good, good, good.

12:54.744 --> 12:55.811
We kept our cover intact.
Ce work.

12:55.845 --> 12:57.079
Quick, professional thinking
out there.

12:57.080 --> 12:58.480
Very quick
Very professional.

12:58.515 --> 13:00.082
- Detective.
- Detective.

13:00.116 --> 13:02.151
- Let's get back on the case.
- Yes.

13:09.599 --> 13:10.799
So how was the restaurant?

13:10.800 --> 13:12.334
Such a normal time!

13:12.368 --> 13:14.669
Why are you being weird?

13:14.670 --> 13:15.704
Amy and I kissed.

13:15.738 --> 13:17.305
What?

13:17.340 --> 13:19.874
To keep our cover from being
blown; we didn't have a choice.

13:19.909 --> 13:21.776
Tell me everything!

13:21.777 --> 13:24.145
(Jake) Charles, it was just a kiss,
okay?

13:24.146 --> 13:25.680
It was for work.
It was nothing.

13:25.715 --> 13:27.249
Yeah, who cares about a kiss?

13:27.250 --> 13:28.917
Call me if you grab
each other's asses.

13:28.918 --> 13:30.318
He's pulling over.
It's going down.

13:30.353 --> 13:32.187
(Charles)
You guys are so naive.

13:32.188 --> 13:33.388
It's never nothing.

13:33.422 --> 13:35.724
In high school, I played
Daddy Warbucks in <i> Annie,</i>

13:35.758 --> 13:37.592
Becca Murse played Annie,

13:37.593 --> 13:39.227
and we were supposed
to hug onstage.

13:39.262 --> 13:41.463
And at first,
that seemed like nothing too,

13:41.464 --> 13:44.666
but by opening night,
we were full-on making out.

13:44.700 --> 13:45.834
As Daddy Warbucks and Annie?

13:45.835 --> 13:46.868
Mm-hmm.

13:46.902 --> 13:48.570
The audience was not on board.

13:48.571 --> 13:49.871
Playwright sued the school.

13:49.872 --> 13:51.439
(Rosa) Guys, guys,
it's not a handoff.

13:51.440 --> 13:52.540
He's leaving the package.

13:55.778 --> 13:57.612
Okay, you and Rosa
follow Augustine.

13:57.647 --> 13:59.547
Right, and you and Amy
follow your hearts.

13:59.582 --> 14:01.283
No, we're gonna stay
with the package.

14:01.317 --> 14:02.517
And each other forever.

14:02.518 --> 14:03.952
Come on, man!

14:03.986 --> 14:06.087
So here's how I see this
going down.

14:06.122 --> 14:07.656
You plead for your job back.
I refuse.

14:07.657 --> 14:09.057
You start weeping
like a war widow.

14:09.058 --> 14:10.292
Does that sound about right?

14:10.326 --> 14:13.461
Don't count
your gross fish babies

14:13.462 --> 14:16.398
before they've hatched,
Madeline.

14:21.537 --> 14:22.704
How did you get this?

14:22.738 --> 14:24.639
(Gina) Gina and Terry got it,
you grackle.

14:24.640 --> 14:26.441
(Ray) It doesn't matter
how I got it.

14:26.475 --> 14:29.811
Sorry, sir, didn't realize that
was how you wanted to play it.

14:29.845 --> 14:32.581
I see you've got an audience
for this little stunt?

14:32.615 --> 14:35.417
Yes, well, who wouldn't want
to see a man fight a crocodile?

14:35.451 --> 14:40.021
Now, Madeline, before one of us
starts weeping like a war widow,

14:40.022 --> 14:41.856
would you like to give me
my precinct back?

14:41.891 --> 14:44.635
It's not that simple; I can't
just reverse your promotion.

14:44.660 --> 14:49.397
You have until tomorrow,
you grackle.

14:49.432 --> 14:51.800
(Rosa) We can't pull him over
this close to the drop site.

14:51.801 --> 14:53.835
It'll alert the buyer.
I say we follow him for a mile.

14:53.836 --> 14:55.136
Copy that.

14:55.137 --> 14:56.538
How's your mom enjoying
the new phone you got her

14:56.539 --> 14:58.106
for her birthday
on March 16th?

14:58.107 --> 15:00.909
Dude, stop saying random facts
to try to prove you know me.

15:00.943 --> 15:02.344
That's not what I'm doing.

15:02.345 --> 15:03.912
I'm simply making small talk
with my friend Rosa,

15:03.913 --> 15:04.946
who went skydiving once.

15:04.947 --> 15:06.147
Enough!

15:06.182 --> 15:07.949
I'm going to the dumb party
but only because

15:07.950 --> 15:09.117
I don't want to hurt Marcus.

15:09.118 --> 15:10.552
I'm still super mad at you.

15:10.586 --> 15:12.420
Mm, like how you're still
super mad at <i> Gilmore Girls</i>

15:12.421 --> 15:13.755
for how the finale went down?

15:13.789 --> 15:17.425
Oh, I just want to see
Lorelai happy, and shut up!

15:17.426 --> 15:21.196
Ah, see? I knew you so well,
I knew it was co... ah!

15:26.903 --> 15:28.503
Hey, seriously,
we're cool, right?

15:28.537 --> 15:30.038
Yeah, totally.

15:30.039 --> 15:31.940
- We're fine.
- Good.

15:31.941 --> 15:33.341
Gosh, you know, I'm actually
a little bit hungry.

15:33.342 --> 15:35.677
I never ended up eating
at that dumb fancy restaurant.

15:35.678 --> 15:37.245
You know what I'm getting
on my way home?

15:37.246 --> 15:38.613
Yeah, you're gonna
go to the Polish place

15:38.614 --> 15:40.048
and get perogies,
potato pancakes,

15:40.049 --> 15:41.149
and a cup of hot chocolate.

15:41.183 --> 15:42.984
That's exactly
what I'm gonna get.

15:42.985 --> 15:44.085
Yeah.

15:44.086 --> 15:45.487
I will be having pizza,

15:45.521 --> 15:47.722
two slices
of meat supreme from Tony's,

15:47.723 --> 15:49.457
served display temperature.

15:49.458 --> 15:51.293
Meat supreme
is a million red flags,

15:51.294 --> 15:52.827
and eating it cold
is just insane.

15:52.828 --> 15:54.062
No, no, no.
It's not cold.

15:54.096 --> 15:55.530
- It's display temperature.
- Jake.

15:55.531 --> 15:56.965
There's a difference, Amy.

15:56.999 --> 15:59.000
No, Jake, he's looking at us.

15:59.035 --> 16:01.203
- Well, this is happening.
- Huh?

16:08.044 --> 16:10.412
NYPD! Freeze!
We are police colleagues!

16:10.413 --> 16:12.723
You're under arrest.
This is a work event.

16:16.098 --> 16:18.567
Hey, can you sign
this arrest report

16:18.568 --> 16:19.801
for Augustine
and the buyer?

16:19.802 --> 16:21.136
Sure.

16:21.137 --> 16:22.671
Great.

16:23.873 --> 16:25.841
Man, I forgot how long
your signature takes.

16:25.842 --> 16:28.076
I'm just gonna watch <i> Braveheart</i>
on my phone real quick.

16:28.110 --> 16:29.477
[laughs]

16:29.512 --> 16:31.580
Given the circumstances,

16:31.581 --> 16:33.715
I could see how
that might have seemed like

16:33.716 --> 16:35.116
flirty teasing
or something,

16:35.151 --> 16:37.486
but I was legit
being critical.

16:37.487 --> 16:38.553
You have a problem.

16:38.588 --> 16:41.723
No, even that sounded
like banter now.

16:41.724 --> 16:43.658
All right, there's only one way
out of this for me.

16:43.659 --> 16:45.126
I just got to get super cruel.

16:45.127 --> 16:47.262
Prepare to have your physical
flaws pointed out, Amy.

16:47.263 --> 16:49.931
I'm talking about your tall butt
and your weird elbows.

16:49.966 --> 16:51.500
Jake, it's okay.

16:51.534 --> 16:53.368
Thank you.

16:53.402 --> 16:55.170
This whole night
was really weird.

16:55.204 --> 16:56.204
I know.

16:56.205 --> 16:57.639
I just... ugh.

16:57.640 --> 16:59.841
I want everything
to go back how it was, you know?

16:59.842 --> 17:00.842
It's so awkward.

17:00.877 --> 17:02.544
- Yeah.
- And you're right.

17:02.545 --> 17:05.380
We shouldn't date cops,
'cause we're a great team.

17:05.381 --> 17:07.015
We work great together.

17:07.016 --> 17:08.250
I don't want to mess that up.

17:08.251 --> 17:10.018
Yeah, I don't want
everything to change.

17:10.051 --> 17:11.185
Yeah, me neither.

17:11.220 --> 17:14.955
Okay, then that's that,
Detective Peralta.

17:14.991 --> 17:17.325
Detective Santiago.

17:17.326 --> 17:19.761
See you around the precinct.

17:19.796 --> 17:21.229
Yep.

17:21.263 --> 17:23.265
Tall butt.

17:23.299 --> 17:25.567
Okay, before we go in,

17:25.601 --> 17:27.903
remember you have to pretend
to be surprised.

17:27.936 --> 17:30.038
How's this?
Oh, my God.

17:30.039 --> 17:32.808
It's so much worse
than I imagined.

17:32.842 --> 17:34.876
The energy was great,
but the message was flawed.

17:34.911 --> 17:37.012
All right,
let's get this over with.

17:38.247 --> 17:40.148
Surprise.

17:40.149 --> 17:41.416
What's going on?

17:41.451 --> 17:43.452
I rented this entire bar

17:43.453 --> 17:46.955
so you and I could celebrate
with no people anywhere near us.

17:46.989 --> 17:48.990
I probably should have
hired a bartender, though.

17:48.991 --> 17:50.325
I have no idea
how to make drinks.

17:50.359 --> 17:51.460
This is incredible.

17:51.494 --> 17:53.361
It was all Charles' idea.

17:54.730 --> 17:55.897
I told you I knew you,
Ro-ro.

17:55.932 --> 17:59.301
Thank you.

17:59.302 --> 18:01.403
But never call me "Ro-ro" again.

18:01.437 --> 18:02.571
Oh, but I will.

18:02.572 --> 18:04.139
I've earned this.

18:04.140 --> 18:06.808
Happy b-day,
Ro-ro.

18:06.809 --> 18:08.510
Whoo!

18:11.547 --> 18:13.548
Welcome, Madeline.
Have you thought things over?

18:13.549 --> 18:16.952
I have, but first, how do I
know you're not wearing a wire?

18:28.135 --> 18:31.578
So I've thought it over,
and perhaps you should go ahead

18:31.579 --> 18:33.635
and show that letter to the
commissioner.

18:33.636 --> 18:35.170
And let him fire you?

18:35.171 --> 18:36.471
I'll deny I wrote it.

18:36.472 --> 18:38.306
It will take months
to authenticate,

18:38.307 --> 18:39.608
which will give me
plenty of time

18:39.609 --> 18:41.777
to make some personnel changes
around here.

18:41.811 --> 18:45.113
There's an opening for a detective
down in Brighton Beach.

18:45.148 --> 18:47.048
I think I'll transfer Diaz
there.

18:47.083 --> 18:49.818
Detective Boyle I'll send
to Long Island City.

18:49.852 --> 18:52.654
Santiago will be a great fit
for Pelham Bay.

18:52.688 --> 18:57.192
And Peralta,
your little pet project,

18:57.193 --> 19:00.395
I'm gonna ship him off
to Staten Island.

19:00.396 --> 19:05.767
Hope he likes breaking up
tanning salon fistfights.

19:05.768 --> 19:09.304
Looks like you've got a decision
to make, Raymond.

19:09.305 --> 19:11.073
What are you gonna do?

19:11.107 --> 19:14.176
(Ray) Squad, if I could have
your attention please?

19:15.945 --> 19:18.346
I am being transferred
to the public relations office.

19:18.347 --> 19:20.382
I'm leaving the Nine-Nine
effective immediately.

19:20.383 --> 19:22.551
- What the hell?
- I don't understand.

19:22.585 --> 19:24.319
- What the hell?
- Why are you doing this?

19:24.353 --> 19:25.554
What the hell?

19:25.555 --> 19:27.456
I want to say
it has been a pleasure

19:27.457 --> 19:31.126
to have worked alongside all of
you for the past 21 1/2 months.

19:31.127 --> 19:33.061
I'm sorry
for getting so emotional.

19:33.096 --> 19:34.529
A pretty consistent tone,
actually.

19:34.564 --> 19:37.899
These have been the...

19:37.900 --> 19:41.002
these have been the best years
of my career.

19:41.037 --> 19:42.437
Oh, no.
This is new.

19:42.438 --> 19:50.438
And I know that everyone of you
gave me everything you had,

19:51.781 --> 19:53.148
and I will never forget it.

19:53.149 --> 19:54.716
Go back to being robot captain.

19:54.751 --> 19:58.053
[laughs]
Meep-morp.

19:58.054 --> 19:59.554
Zeet.

19:59.555 --> 20:02.157
[clears throat]
Dismissed.

20:08.464 --> 20:11.233
Sir!

20:11.234 --> 20:12.467
I'm coming with you.

20:12.502 --> 20:14.469
- Thank you, Gina.
- I'm also coming.

20:14.504 --> 20:16.271
Not necessary.

20:19.776 --> 20:21.510
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:21.511 --> 20:22.878
Thought I might find you
in here.

20:22.912 --> 20:25.213
I just needed to process
the captain's news.

20:25.248 --> 20:26.481
I feel so bad for him.

20:26.516 --> 20:27.816
So how are you holding up?

20:29.252 --> 20:31.253
I don't know.
I'm still in shock.

20:31.287 --> 20:33.088
You?

20:33.089 --> 20:35.924
Um, basically handling it the
way I dealt with my dad leaving,

20:35.925 --> 20:38.126
just repressing the hell
out of it.

20:41.431 --> 20:43.465
So a lot of change
around here, huh?

20:55.378 --> 20:57.546
(man) Hey, Jake,
the new captain's here.

21:03.686 --> 21:05.053
Who do you think
it's gonna be?

21:05.054 --> 21:06.455
(Terry)
I have no idea.

21:06.456 --> 21:08.223
I bet it's me.

21:08.224 --> 21:10.192
I just hope I'm ready.

21:10.193 --> 21:11.326
(Rosa)
Wow.

21:11.327 --> 21:12.694
Come on, guys.

21:12.695 --> 21:14.229
I know you're sad,

21:14.230 --> 21:16.665
but let's do our best to make
a good first impression here.

21:16.666 --> 21:17.666
Smart. Good call.

21:17.667 --> 21:20.736
Jake, you be up front.

21:20.737 --> 21:22.571
[elevator bell dings]

21:22.572 --> 21:25.654
Okay, here we go.
