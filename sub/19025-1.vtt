04:02.709 --> 04:04.250

04:04.333 --> 04:05.917

04:13.875 --> 04:15.125
I would, (squeaks)

04:15.208 --> 04:16.834
but even though
this room was quite crowded

04:16.917 --> 04:20.000
when you sucker-punched me,
apparently nobody saw it happen.

04:20.083 --> 04:21.083
(chuckles)

04:21.625 --> 04:23.208
Uh, saw what happen, sir?

04:23.875 --> 04:27.542

So, Dr. Cox, can you,
uh, look at her chart?

Newbie, did you not see
what just happened?

04:34.000 --> 04:36.875

04:38.875 --> 04:40.291

Wake up.

04:40.375 --> 04:44.375

04:54.417 --> 04:56.625
Dr. Moyer, uh, you told me
my patient had colitis,

04:56.709 --> 04:58.709
and it turns out it was
just traveler's diarrhea.

04:58.792 --> 05:01.041
So? That sounds like good news.

05:01.125 --> 05:03.959
Yeah. He took it as bad news,

05:04.041 --> 05:05.792
maybe 'cause of
the unnecessary colonoscope

05:05.875 --> 05:07.583
I shoved 3 feet up his pooper?

05:08.166 --> 05:09.959
What do you want me to do?

05:10.041 --> 05:12.125
Uh, a... apologize to my patient

05:12.208 --> 05:15.000
and tell him it was your mistake,
no big deal?

05:16.208 --> 05:18.083
Think I'm gonna pass on that one.

05:18.166 --> 05:20.750
See, I got you pegged as one of those
spineless types

05:20.834 --> 05:23.583
that's not gonna cause me any trouble
no matter what I do.

05:24.083 --> 05:26.709
So thanks for stopping by

05:27.417 --> 05:29.333

get someone

06:24.792 --> 06:26.875
to cover for me out at the prison tonight.

06:26.959 --> 06:30.458
I know that the very idea
of you doin' a favor for me

06:30.542 --> 06:32.875
makes those ass cheeks
clench up so tight

06:32.959 --> 06:34.875
that we could shove
a lump of coal up there

06:34.959 --> 06:37.583
and you'd probably crap out a diamond,
right? (chuckles)

06:37.667 --> 06:39.333
Oh. Come on, Bob.

06:39.417 --> 06:42.375
I can't even remember the last time I saw
my son, and you... you...

06:43.125 --> 06:44.792
you're a father, for god's sake.

06:45.125 --> 06:46.500
You understand, don't you?

06:46.583 --> 06:50.166
My son was recently kicked out
of his Hare Krishna sect

06:50.250 --> 06:51.709
for being too much of a hippie

06:51.792 --> 06:54.959
and is currently residing
in the Portland subway system.

06:55.041 --> 06:59.625
The point, Perry, is that the only thing
I care less about than my son is your son.

07:00.291 --> 07:01.542
Have fun at the big house.

07:01.542 --> 07:03.709

07:04.625 --> 07:05.625
Hey.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.375
You guys know that unbelievably handsome
new anesthesiologist?

07:09.458 --> 07:10.792
-Yes. No.
-No.

07:11.166 --> 07:12.291
Well, he didn't know
I was engaged,

07:12.375 --> 07:14.291
so he asked me out to a movie tonight.

07:14.375 --> 07:17.291
Oh, if he's paying,
get a brother some sno-caps.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.250
-Turk, why don't you ever get jealous?
-Woman, look at me.

07:21.917 --> 07:23.583
I mean, how could someone with all
of this here

07:23.667 --> 07:25.250
be jealous of any of that out there?

07:25.333 --> 07:28.250
You know what I realized when I was
dragging my car door around?

07:28.875 --> 07:31.792
I cannot remember the last good thing
that happened to me at this place.

07:31.875 --> 07:34.792
I mean, what is it about me that makes
everybody walk all over me?

07:34.875 --> 07:36.792
-No self-confidence.
-You can be a baby sometimes.

07:36.875 --> 07:38.375
Your voice gets really high
when you're upset.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.917
(high voice)
Rhetorical question, ok?!

07:40.875 --> 07:42.750
Now, I'm getting smoothies.
Who wants one?

07:42.834 --> 07:44.083
-Peach fizzle.
-Banana razzmatazz?

07:44.166 --> 07:46.500
-Orange goo-goo.
-Got it.

07:47.291 --> 07:49.125
(pager beeps)

07:50.000 --> 07:51.333
Mrs. Farr. You know what?

07:51.417 --> 07:53.291
The only way I'm gonna figure out
what's wrong with this woman

07:53.375 --> 07:54.667
is to start running tests for everything.

07:54.750 --> 07:56.583
Good luck, Bambi. Look at the time.

-Hey.

08:24.709 --> 08:27.166
-Elliot, how... how you doing?
-You look great!

08:28.166 --> 08:30.583
Except the buzz cut is kind of tapping
into this recurring dream I have

08:30.667 --> 08:33.000
where my dad makes me marry this army
colonel named Johnny Cakes,

08:33.083 --> 08:35.667
who, as it turns out,
already has a wife in the Philippines.

08:35.750 --> 08:37.250
Anyways, she and I become friends,

08:37.333 --> 08:40.333
but then she smothers him with her thighs
and then frames me for it.

08:41.041 --> 08:42.750
Well, yeah, I'm doing about the same, too.

08:44.750 --> 08:47.583
I thought you hated this place
'cause of that time you got sick here.

08:47.667 --> 08:48.959
You remember that?

08:49.750 --> 08:51.959
Well, you... you got sick on my face.

08:52.583 --> 08:53.834
Oh, no, no, that wasn't the smoothies.

08:53.917 --> 08:55.625
You just said you thought you were
falling in love with me,

08:55.709 --> 08:57.959
and sometimes when I get really
uncomfortable, I hurl.

08:58.041 --> 09:00.667
I know! I get... I get a little, uh,
gassy.

09:01.291 --> 09:03.542
Look, Sean, this is gonna sound weird,
but...

09:03.917 --> 09:04.917
This is fate.

09:05.417 --> 09:07.458
I mean, things have just
been so bleak for me lately.

09:07.542 --> 09:09.041
I've been waiting for something...
someone...

09:09.125 --> 09:11.375
to come along, you know,
and here you are.

09:11.458 --> 09:13.500
(laughs) The one that got away!

09:14.667 --> 09:16.875
I mean, that means something, right?

09:16.959 --> 09:18.625
-Yeah, I think it, uh--
-Hello.

09:18.709 --> 09:20.208
Hey. Hi. Oh.

09:21.417 --> 09:24.458
-(vomiting)
-No, no, no, it's ok. It's... it happens.

09:25.166 --> 09:27.166
That girl is extra-strength crazy.

09:27.709 --> 09:28.792
I don't know. I mean, she's a doctor.

09:28.875 --> 09:30.542
She's gotta have it a little bit together,
right?

09:35.917 --> 09:38.125
Elliot, your smoothies
are on your car.

09:38.208 --> 09:40.166

09:42.291 --> 09:43.792

10:10.625 --> 10:14.333

Ok. If we're ever gonna figure out what's
wrong with that lady,

That's, uh-- that's my son.

10:37.417 --> 10:39.333
He's adorable. Can I keep it?

10:39.417 --> 10:40.959
No.

10:41.041 --> 10:43.875
No, you... you certainly may not.

10:45.041 --> 10:46.125
Bad man.

10:46.792 --> 10:48.333
(J.D.)<i> Still, even that's not the worst.</i>

10:51.792 --> 10:52.959
Ok, I'll go get the X-ray,

10:53.041 --> 10:54.583
you two go work on the echocardiogram,

10:54.667 --> 10:57.500
and then all three of us will meet back here
to deal with the abdominal cat scan, ok?

10:59.250 --> 11:00.959
-W... What can I do?
-We got it, Elliot.

11:01.333 --> 11:04.083
(J.D.)<i> Being such a mess that your friends</i>
<i>don't even ask for your help?</i>

11:04.625 --> 11:06.208
<i>That's the bottom of the barrel.</i>

11:17.917 --> 11:18.917
(J.D.)<i> Sometimes in life,</i>

11:19.000 --> 11:21.083
<i>all there is to do is</i>
<i>ponder your own shortcomings</i>

11:21.166 --> 11:24.750
<i>by cannonballing four straight 32-ounce</i>
<i>protein-enhanced smoothies.</i>

11:25.458 --> 11:27.083
Ooh. (burps)

11:27.166 --> 11:28.709
You'll be ok, Marshmallow.

11:28.792 --> 11:33.458
Laverne, do you call me Marshmallow
because I'm soft and easily flattened?

11:33.542 --> 11:34.625
Well, yeah.

11:35.125 --> 11:38.625
But if it makes you feel any better,
it's also because you're very white.

11:38.709 --> 11:41.542
(squeaking)

11:42.166 --> 11:43.667
Where the hell's Ted?

11:44.166 --> 11:47.125
(squeaking)

11:47.667 --> 11:49.458
109 is my record.

11:50.250 --> 11:51.625
Hmm!

11:52.667 --> 11:53.792
Damn!

11:55.667 --> 11:58.500
Look, I know you're the only X-ray tech
on tonight, all right?

11:58.583 --> 11:59.917
But I just need a quick abdominal scan

12:00.000 --> 12:01.542
to make sure Mrs. Farr doesn't
have an obstruction--

12:01.625 --> 12:03.625
Uh-uh-uh!
Don't want to know who they are.

12:03.709 --> 12:04.875
Don't want to know how they're doing.

12:04.959 --> 12:06.959
Just want to go click-click
and get 'em out of here.

12:07.041 --> 12:09.750
Now, your lady's about
40 people down on the list,

12:09.834 --> 12:12.750
and as always, there are no cutsies.

12:12.834 --> 12:14.166
Damn.

12:14.250 --> 12:17.458
Look, uh... there's got to be something
I can do.

12:19.208 --> 12:21.041
See, because of the way
I laid on top of you,

12:21.125 --> 12:23.542
I can tell people this is
an X-ray of Siamese twins.

12:23.625 --> 12:25.709
-How cool is that?
-It's so cool, laddy,

12:25.792 --> 12:27.542
let's never talk to
anyone about it ever.

12:27.625 --> 12:28.709
Oh.

12:29.125 --> 12:30.208
I don't understand how you think

12:30.291 --> 12:32.625
you can get this cardiologist to do
an echocardiogram for us.

12:32.709 --> 12:35.667
I've worked in the cath lab before.
I understand how these guys think.

12:35.750 --> 12:37.333
Plus I had a one-nighter
with him a long time ago.

12:37.417 --> 12:39.417
Ok. Oh ho ho!

12:39.500 --> 12:41.417
You're telling me this guy in here
got tasty treats?

12:41.500 --> 12:44.792
Turk, I worked here eight years before you
showed up. I had sexual needs.

12:44.875 --> 12:47.125
Ok, first of all, that's disgusting.

12:47.208 --> 12:48.333
Are you jealous?

12:49.083 --> 12:50.125
No.

12:50.208 --> 12:52.917
Ahh, so you don't mind
if I go in there alone?

12:54.250 --> 12:55.667
Thank you.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Aah!

13:01.333 --> 13:04.166
So, Mitchell, I guess I was just
hoping that you would

13:04.250 --> 13:06.458
help us out with this patient Mrs. Farr.

13:06.542 --> 13:08.542
Carla, love to really, but, uh...

13:09.333 --> 13:11.625
it's already 6:00 and it's
my son's birthday tonight.

13:11.709 --> 13:13.542
-How old is he?
-He's 10.

13:13.625 --> 13:15.208
And how long ago was that night

13:15.291 --> 13:18.083
that you told me you were single
and you took me dancing?

13:18.166 --> 13:20.250
8 years. I'll see you
in the patient's room.

13:29.333 --> 13:30.834
All taken care of.

13:31.333 --> 13:32.834
How is that funny?

13:33.875 --> 13:35.458
(Jordan)
Don't you love the outfit?

13:35.542 --> 13:38.458
You know, I always wanted to be the father
of a tiny gay sailor.

13:38.542 --> 13:39.917
Jordan, come on.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.166
We agreed that we would wait until he's
quite a bit older

13:42.250 --> 13:45.166
before we started systematically ruining
his life, right?

13:46.583 --> 13:47.917
Right?

13:48.000 --> 13:50.458
I may have painted his toenails
for funsies.

13:50.542 --> 13:51.709
(whimpers)

13:52.542 --> 13:55.750
Dr. Cox, I managed to get
some tests done on Mrs. Farr.

13:55.834 --> 13:59.041
Look, Gwyneth, you're old enough now
to hear this from me.

13:59.125 --> 14:01.500
Every time I go out of my way to help
you children,

14:01.583 --> 14:03.750
I get nothing but trouble.

14:04.083 --> 14:07.417
Now, this is the first 5-minute window
I've had in the last week

14:07.500 --> 14:09.083
to be with my son.

14:09.166 --> 14:11.667
And I'm just not going to have you
pirouetting around in here

14:11.750 --> 14:13.458
while my heart is breaking inside.

14:15.667 --> 14:16.792
Sorry.

14:18.083 --> 14:20.291
Your heart is breaking inside?

14:21.500 --> 14:23.667
That is so embarrassing for you.

14:23.750 --> 14:24.875
Thank you for that.

14:29.291 --> 14:30.583
(clanging)

14:30.667 --> 14:31.834
What are you doing in here?

14:32.667 --> 14:34.500
It's... the men's room.

14:35.125 --> 14:36.208
I know.

14:36.750 --> 14:38.125
I mean, it's not like I thought

14:38.208 --> 14:39.875
those were some kind of
new female urinals

14:39.959 --> 14:42.667
and then tried them and found them...

14:43.083 --> 14:44.417
oddly comfortable.

14:45.083 --> 14:47.333
I'm just going to replace these
urinal cakes.

14:47.417 --> 14:48.417
(sniffs)

14:48.500 --> 14:49.583
And then I'll go.

14:49.667 --> 14:52.000
(whimpers)
Why can't I just grow up?

14:52.625 --> 14:54.291
Why can't I be stronger?

14:55.959 --> 14:57.041
Janitor...

14:57.709 --> 14:59.709
have you ever looked at yourself and
wished that you were different

14:59.792 --> 15:01.500
in every single way?

15:01.583 --> 15:04.583
No. I'm a winner.

15:05.208 --> 15:08.792
But I will tell you something that my
grandmother told me when I was a kid...

15:09.208 --> 15:11.208
even though at the time I thought she was
my mother.

15:11.625 --> 15:16.583
She said, "time spent
wishing is time wasted."

15:17.750 --> 15:19.375
Now, she died shortly after that...

15:19.458 --> 15:23.583
and my sister, who actually was my mother,
she never got over it.

15:24.333 --> 15:25.875
Neither did my brother dad.

15:26.792 --> 15:27.959
What is this?

15:28.041 --> 15:29.709
If you want to be different...

15:30.792 --> 15:32.083
then be different.

15:32.166 --> 15:33.625
Thank you.

15:33.709 --> 15:35.250
Yeah. We're all under
one roof here.

15:35.333 --> 15:36.792
We got to watch out for each other, right?

15:37.417 --> 15:38.417
Come on!

15:39.375 --> 15:40.542
There he is.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.208
Whoa!

15:43.291 --> 15:44.375
(crash)

15:45.041 --> 15:46.458
Watch out.

15:47.125 --> 15:50.875
(J.D.)<i> Ow. Unfortunately that's when</i>
<i>we ran into a brick wall.</i>

15:50.959 --> 15:53.125
I'm head of the radiology
department.

15:53.625 --> 15:55.875
You call me in from home to do an
abdominal cat scan

15:55.959 --> 15:59.250
that could wait until Monday morning,
well, guess what? It's not happening.

15:59.333 --> 16:01.875
-Dr. Moyers--
-These are my machines!

16:01.959 --> 16:04.291
-Sir--
-My machines!

16:04.375 --> 16:06.667
-Whose machines?
-My machines!

16:06.750 --> 16:07.792
How is that helpful?

16:07.875 --> 16:12.542
They're mine, mine, my machines!
My machines! My machines! My machines!

16:14.166 --> 16:18.166
(squeak)

16:18.792 --> 16:20.709
Oh, so you're going to sock me again.

16:20.792 --> 16:24.166
Good God, Perry, at a certain point,
you're just beating up an old man.

16:24.875 --> 16:27.667
-Relax. I'm just fixing your nose.
-Unh!

16:27.750 --> 16:30.333
I'm real sorry
I cold-cocked you there, Bob.

16:30.417 --> 16:31.583
I shouldn't have done that.

16:32.166 --> 16:34.458
Even if it did actually
feel so damn good

16:34.542 --> 16:36.583
I changed my pants afterwards.

16:36.667 --> 16:40.250
But still, I'm starting
to think it would be smart

16:40.333 --> 16:42.166
if you and I were to bury the hatchet.

16:42.750 --> 16:44.083
What do you say there, Bob?

16:45.375 --> 16:47.208
Come on, handsome.

16:47.291 --> 16:48.750
Ha ha ha.

16:50.041 --> 16:51.333
Listen up, Ace.

16:51.667 --> 16:54.667
You will always be
a royal pain in my ass

16:54.750 --> 16:56.667
and I will always
be waiting for the day

16:56.750 --> 16:59.125
when I get to jam that knife into your
side once and for all

16:59.208 --> 17:00.875
and you know it as well as I do!

17:02.917 --> 17:04.083
(crack)

17:06.333 --> 17:08.792
-Much better. Thanks.
-You're welcome.

17:08.875 --> 17:11.291
People don't change, Perry.

Dr. Moyer, you're going to give Mrs. Farr

18:30.542 --> 18:32.375
the abdominal cat scan
and I'll tell you why.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.792
You remember that colon patient of mine
that you screwed up on?

18:35.875 --> 18:37.875
I'm going to tell them exactly whose fault
that was,

18:37.959 --> 18:39.375
and I'm going to spend
every waking second

18:39.458 --> 18:41.375
helping them figure out how to physically
and financially

18:41.458 --> 18:43.041
bitch slap you, even if the end result is

18:43.125 --> 18:45.959
we both get our asses fired.
Your move, chuckles.

18:46.291 --> 18:47.750
Bring her
down.

18:49.083 --> 18:52.208
-Elliot!
-Hells yeah.

18:54.291 --> 18:55.333
Wow.

18:57.792 --> 18:59.125
(J.D.)<i> It feels good to work as a team</i>

18:59.208 --> 19:00.959
<i>and gather all the pieces</i>
<i>of the puzzle together</i>

19:01.041 --> 19:03.792
<i>so we can finally look Mrs. Farr in the</i>
<i>face and tell her...</i>

19:04.625 --> 19:06.083
<i>We still don't know</i>
<i>what the hell she has.</i>

19:06.583 --> 19:08.542
Damn it. Why can't we figure out what's
wrong with this lady?

19:09.083 --> 19:10.250
All right, you guys.

19:10.667 --> 19:11.792
What do you know so far?

19:11.875 --> 19:14.417
The echo ruled out
an aortic dissection.

19:14.500 --> 19:17.291
The abdominal CT would've shown if it
was biliary disease.

19:17.375 --> 19:19.417
Think. What's her background?

19:19.500 --> 19:21.333
"Persian Sephardic Jew."

19:21.417 --> 19:24.458
Aw, come on, you guys,
give me a break. You know this.

19:26.333 --> 19:28.500
Familial Mediterranean Fever.

19:29.583 --> 19:30.583

-Hello, Slackers.
-Aah!

19:50.291 --> 19:51.959
Now, I would've never
have figured it out

19:52.041 --> 19:53.792
unless you guys
had done the legwork.

19:53.875 --> 19:56.667
You four deserve all the credit. Really!

19:57.417 --> 19:58.500
Mrs. Farr,

19:59.125 --> 20:03.208
Dr. Cox has saved the day.
Don't you just love it?

20:03.625 --> 20:05.041
Come here.

20:07.500 --> 20:10.041
(J.D.)<i> And if something does change,</i>
<i>more often than not,</i>

20:10.166 --> 20:12.375
<i>it just reminds you of feelings you've</i>
<i>had all along.</i>

20:12.458 --> 20:13.667
You look beautiful.

20:13.750 --> 20:15.792
(J.D.)<i> Like I said,</i>
<i>once you get to third year,</i>

20:15.875 --> 20:17.000
<i>there aren't a lot of surprises.</i>

20:17.083 --> 20:18.750
Hey, Elliot.

20:18.834 --> 20:19.834
Hey.

20:22.959 --> 20:24.291
What are you doing here?

20:25.792 --> 20:27.667
(Elliot laughing)

20:27.750 --> 20:28.834
(thinking) <i>Damn.</i>
