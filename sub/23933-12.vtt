(Episode 12)

00:59.200 --> 01:03.039
(Queen of Mystery 2)

01:05.369 --> 01:06.380
Open your mouth.

01:06.380 --> 01:07.439
It's okay.

01:07.639 --> 01:08.639
I'm...

01:08.639 --> 01:10.009
(Violent Crimes Unit 1,\NGye Sung Woo)

01:10.079 --> 01:12.809
Mr. Gye, your skin\Nlooks worn out.

01:12.809 --> 01:14.619
Vitamin C is\Nthe best for your skin.

01:14.619 --> 01:15.880
Open your mouth.

01:16.179 --> 01:18.619
Why are you giving this...

01:18.619 --> 01:20.220
Just eat it.

01:22.220 --> 01:23.490
I heard\Nyou like chocolate.

01:23.490 --> 01:25.830
I brought all kinds.\NWhite, milk, dark,

01:25.830 --> 01:27.130
and almond chocolate.

01:27.130 --> 01:28.529
You can keep them here.

01:31.330 --> 01:34.140
Lady, why are you\Ndoing this to me?

01:34.140 --> 01:35.440
She's not "lady".

01:35.500 --> 01:37.309
She's an administrative\Nassistant.

01:38.369 --> 01:40.809
Mr. Gye calling me\N"lady" makes the word...

01:40.809 --> 01:42.580
sound French and sexy.

01:43.710 --> 01:44.710
Lady.

01:46.279 --> 01:48.080
I heard you were always...

01:48.080 --> 01:50.449
the top three student\Nin the police academy.

01:50.720 --> 01:53.390
I mean, everyone there is\Nreally smart. How amazing.

01:53.390 --> 01:54.690
He was number three,\Nand I was the top.

01:55.419 --> 01:58.190
Mr. Gye, you must have\Na good memory too.

01:58.190 --> 01:59.259
Right?

01:59.600 --> 02:01.300
Open your mouth.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.600
Say what you have to say.

02:03.869 --> 02:07.270
Do you remember\Nall of your old cases...

02:07.270 --> 02:08.538
that you've investigated?

02:08.899 --> 02:10.038
For example,

02:10.240 --> 02:13.279
a missing case from\Nseven years ago.

02:15.110 --> 02:16.809
A missing case\Nfrom seven years ago?

02:18.649 --> 02:20.950
- Ah Ram, go on.\N- Goodbye.

02:21.619 --> 02:22.779
- See you later.\N- Okay.

02:22.779 --> 02:24.149
Don't fight\Nwith your friends.

02:24.149 --> 02:25.450
I won't.

02:29.559 --> 02:31.390
Gosh, I'm late now.

02:33.800 --> 02:35.529
(Violent Crimes Unit 1)

02:35.529 --> 02:37.200
Corporal Gong.

02:37.469 --> 02:39.670
Corporal Gong, do you\Nrealize what time it is?

02:39.869 --> 02:41.899
Yes, I'm sorry.

02:42.170 --> 02:43.710
Violent Crimes Unit One is\Nthe center of our station.

02:43.710 --> 02:45.909
Have you forgotten\Nabout how busy we are?

02:45.909 --> 02:47.939
You always have to be\Non time.

02:48.140 --> 02:50.610
I'm sorry. I have to\Nuse the restroom.

02:54.279 --> 02:55.719
Do you remember...

02:56.050 --> 02:58.149
who reported him\Nas missing...

02:58.550 --> 02:59.589
seven years ago?

02:59.890 --> 03:01.159
It was Jang Se Yeon.

03:03.029 --> 03:06.529
You even remember\Nhis daughter's name?

03:09.099 --> 03:10.099
Well,

03:10.599 --> 03:13.599
all detectives can\Nremember that much.

03:16.610 --> 03:17.610
What?

03:18.869 --> 03:20.839
Let's see,\Nseven years ago?

03:22.140 --> 03:25.409
Yes, that was back\Nwhen everything was crazy.

03:25.610 --> 03:28.820
I remember Il Hoon Gang\Nand Jo Byeong Dal.

03:28.820 --> 03:30.589
Man, his punches\Nwere so quick.

03:30.589 --> 03:32.050
And who else?

03:32.390 --> 03:34.119
I remember Sang Tak Gang\Nand their number two.

03:34.119 --> 03:35.520
He's missing\Nhis left arm now.

03:35.689 --> 03:38.230
And Nam Jin\Nof Namguro Gang.

03:38.559 --> 03:40.029
He was a great singer.

03:40.159 --> 03:42.760
I'm sure he's singing\Nsomewhere in prison.

03:47.369 --> 03:48.369
Welcome.

03:48.740 --> 03:50.170
Your seat is in the back.

03:53.809 --> 03:54.809
Okay.

03:56.980 --> 03:58.679
Is Detective Ha at\NViolent Crimes Unit One?

03:59.480 --> 04:00.849
How did you know?

04:02.249 --> 04:04.749
Please tell him\Nto stop by Unit Two...

04:05.689 --> 04:07.260
when he's free.

04:11.559 --> 04:12.559
Mr. Woo.

04:14.330 --> 04:15.899
I have a question.

04:17.428 --> 04:18.428
What is it?

04:19.300 --> 04:22.299
When will we have\Nour staff dinner?

04:24.770 --> 04:28.210
(Violent Crimes Unit 2)

04:28.510 --> 04:32.609
(Mr. Gye versus\NHa Wan Seung)

04:32.609 --> 04:33.979
What's the name of\Nthe missing person?

04:34.120 --> 04:36.349
- Jang Myung Hoon.\N- You got it.

04:38.450 --> 04:40.089
What's his wife's name?

04:40.690 --> 04:41.719
Park Ki...

04:41.719 --> 04:42.789
Wrong!

04:42.989 --> 04:44.690
What are we doing?\NIt's Park Kyung Ja.

04:47.299 --> 04:49.099
Who is Jang Myung Hoon's\Nbusiness partner?

04:49.159 --> 04:50.770
How can I know that?

04:50.770 --> 04:52.570
Ki Young Sub. His wife is\NLee Hyun Sook.

04:52.899 --> 04:55.599
Mr. Gye, you have\Nan amazing memory.

04:56.609 --> 04:58.169
When did Jang Myung Hoon\Ngo missing?

04:58.169 --> 04:59.680
March 20, 2011.

05:00.080 --> 05:01.080
That was Sunday.

05:01.810 --> 05:03.279
How do you know that?

05:03.279 --> 05:05.549
He was reported missing\Non March 24, 2011.

05:05.549 --> 05:06.719
His daughter Jang Se Yeon\Nmade the report.

05:06.719 --> 05:08.149
She was 21 years old\Nat the time.

05:12.020 --> 05:13.159
That's strange.

05:13.719 --> 05:14.760
What is?

05:15.919 --> 05:17.560
Jang Myung Hoon\Ndidn't go missing...

05:17.560 --> 05:18.960
on Sunday.

05:21.060 --> 05:23.370
My memory\Nhas never been wrong.

05:24.330 --> 05:26.739
He used to memorize things\Nreally well at school.

05:26.739 --> 05:29.000
But he lacks creativity\Nand can't catch criminals.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.010
Monday.

05:30.469 --> 05:32.539
Someone even saw\NJang Myung Hoon.

05:32.539 --> 05:33.839
His neighbor.

05:34.080 --> 05:35.279
You saw him leave\Nhis house...

05:35.279 --> 05:37.680
on the day he went\Nmissing, did you?

05:37.909 --> 05:41.349
That man came out with\Na huge suitcase at dawn.

05:41.349 --> 05:44.120
I thought he was\Ngoing on a trip.

05:44.450 --> 05:46.460
I remember that lady.

05:46.620 --> 05:47.789
She saw him...

05:47.789 --> 05:49.729
when she was on her way\Nfor early prayer.

05:49.729 --> 05:51.229
To New Joongjin Church\Nnear her house.

05:51.659 --> 05:53.229
What about it?

05:53.799 --> 05:55.060
New Joongjin Church\Ndoesn't have...

05:55.060 --> 05:56.969
early prayer\Nservice on Sundays.

05:56.969 --> 05:59.070
They have it only\Non the weekdays.

05:59.070 --> 06:01.969
You found\Na very important lead.

06:01.969 --> 06:03.839
But I have to go\Nto a meeting now.

06:08.339 --> 06:09.979
Do you really have to\Ndo this?

06:10.710 --> 06:12.409
Pocket your pride.

06:12.409 --> 06:15.250
Mr. Gye is the only one\Nwho knows about the case.

06:18.649 --> 06:19.919
Mr. Gye.

06:20.719 --> 06:22.989
What are you doing here?\NWhat are you doing?

06:22.989 --> 06:25.529
We've been waiting\Nfor you.

06:27.330 --> 06:30.169
Fine. What else do you\Nwant to know?

06:30.330 --> 06:31.399
Ask me quickly.

06:31.399 --> 06:33.070
Can we get more...

06:33.070 --> 06:36.070
detailed information\Nabout the case?

06:36.270 --> 06:37.609
All the documents\Nhave been discarded...

06:37.609 --> 06:39.210
because its investigation\Nwas done, okay?

06:39.210 --> 06:40.979
I told you there was none.

06:41.210 --> 06:44.680
But you still have\Nyour memory.

06:45.950 --> 06:47.049
Mr. Gye.

06:48.180 --> 06:50.219
Mr. Gye.

06:57.830 --> 07:00.200
(Restricted Area)

07:00.200 --> 07:01.760
Professor Hwang,\Nwhat are you doing?

07:02.330 --> 07:04.529
I start my morning...

07:04.529 --> 07:06.200
by cleaning the door knob.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.799
- Should I clean it?\N- No.

07:09.099 --> 07:10.839
I have to do this myself.

07:10.909 --> 07:12.339
Cleaning fingerprints\Nshould be done...

07:12.339 --> 07:15.779
as delicately as\Ntaking fingerprints.

07:18.080 --> 07:21.219
By the way, why are you\Ncleaning fingerprints?

07:24.219 --> 07:26.289
In order to obtain\Nfresh fingerprints,

07:26.289 --> 07:28.520
you need\Na clean background.

07:28.520 --> 07:31.690
I hate overlapping\Nfingerprints the most.

07:33.599 --> 07:34.799
I see.

07:39.130 --> 07:40.739
Here. Go ahead.

07:54.219 --> 07:55.250
Congratulations.

07:55.250 --> 07:57.789
You've been registered\Nin my fingerprint ledger.

08:03.330 --> 08:05.260
You made a ledger.

08:05.260 --> 08:06.899
Since we're colleagues,

08:06.899 --> 08:09.099
I should have\Nyour fingerprint.

08:10.270 --> 08:14.169
Is it kind of like\Na camaraderie?

08:14.570 --> 08:16.239
I guess you can say that.

08:17.039 --> 08:18.539
Today, I'll teach you...

08:18.539 --> 08:22.140
how to detect\Nand collect fingerprints.

08:22.239 --> 08:23.279
Okay.

08:24.849 --> 08:26.010
Let's try with this.

08:33.919 --> 08:36.390
A flashlight?

08:43.030 --> 08:45.070
I'll be out for a minute.

08:45.070 --> 08:46.639
Find fingerprints on it.

08:47.269 --> 08:48.269
Okay.

09:07.089 --> 09:09.019
I know you're the ace.

09:09.589 --> 09:10.960
Let's be done with it\Nalready.

09:11.790 --> 09:14.359
Nobody can stop her\Nwhen she's into something.

09:16.700 --> 09:19.530
Maybe she's into me.

09:20.540 --> 09:21.540
Hey.

09:22.670 --> 09:24.040
Nonsense.

09:24.839 --> 09:26.580
She has high standards,\Nyou know.

09:27.540 --> 09:29.310
- Gosh.\N- Exactly.

09:36.349 --> 09:38.050
This room hasn't changed\Na bit.

09:39.619 --> 09:42.420
When did your husband\Ngo missing?

09:42.420 --> 09:43.960
March 21.

09:45.830 --> 09:48.530
March 21 was a Monday.

09:48.530 --> 09:49.530
Yes.

09:50.330 --> 09:53.099
You told me it was\NSunday, March 21.

09:53.469 --> 09:55.769
Pardon?\NWhen did I say that?

09:56.810 --> 09:58.869
I was here seven years ago\Nto investigate the case.

09:59.609 --> 10:00.810
Don't you remember me?

10:03.650 --> 10:05.050
Oh, I remember.

10:05.680 --> 10:07.719
I was confused then.

10:08.050 --> 10:09.820
I realized\Nit was Monday...

10:10.119 --> 10:11.820
after hearing\Nwhat the neighbor said.

10:13.489 --> 10:15.790
Isn't it strange\Nhow she found out...

10:15.790 --> 10:18.690
the date he went missing\Nfrom her neighbor?

10:19.389 --> 10:21.229
It must've been\Nreally crazy for her...

10:21.229 --> 10:22.660
because her husband\Nwent missing.

10:22.800 --> 10:24.400
Then shouldn't she have...

10:24.400 --> 10:26.400
contacted\Nher daughter first?

10:26.400 --> 10:28.700
She called her daughter\Nfour days after.

10:28.900 --> 10:30.839
She probably didn't\Nwant to make her worry.

10:32.739 --> 10:34.479
- This is it.\N- Yes, okay.

10:49.690 --> 10:50.889
This place\Nis also strange.

10:51.589 --> 10:53.229
She believes that\Nher husband will return.

10:53.229 --> 10:54.830
So she has never moved.

10:55.229 --> 10:58.200
My mom is still waiting\Nfor my dad to come home.

10:58.200 --> 11:00.469
The house is old,\Nbut she doesn't move.

11:00.599 --> 11:02.769
Why did she put\Nhis stuff in a storage?

11:03.540 --> 11:06.210
His stuff was here\Nfrom the beginning.

11:07.239 --> 11:10.080
He used this place\Nas his personal studio.

11:12.509 --> 11:13.879
Nothing much changed...

11:14.349 --> 11:16.290
compared to\Nseven years ago.

11:17.219 --> 11:19.519
Except for the dust.

11:24.229 --> 11:25.430
Wait.

11:28.400 --> 11:29.599
It's not here.

11:29.930 --> 11:30.999
What's not here?

11:31.530 --> 11:32.729
The key.

11:33.339 --> 11:36.369
There was a key here\Nbefore. On top of this.

11:38.139 --> 11:40.879
With a blue rabbit\Nkey chain.

11:42.139 --> 11:45.050
What's that key for?

11:46.379 --> 11:47.780
It's for the human\Nresources office...

11:47.780 --> 11:49.280
my husband\Nand his partner run.

11:50.589 --> 11:52.119
Human resources office.

11:56.989 --> 11:58.330
What's weird about that?

12:04.670 --> 12:08.239
He was seen leaving\Nthe house...

12:08.239 --> 12:10.210
with a suitcase at 4:30am\Non Monday.

12:16.280 --> 12:18.849
Can you tell me\Nwhen you saw him?

12:18.849 --> 12:21.650
On Monday, on my way\Nto early morning prayer.

12:21.979 --> 12:23.950
On Monday.\NEarly morning prayer.

12:24.749 --> 12:26.589
(Monday,\NEarly morning prayer)

12:26.719 --> 12:28.519
And someone saw...

12:28.519 --> 12:30.790
his key at 5am.

12:33.830 --> 12:35.700
The key with a rabbit doll\Nkey chain.

12:36.060 --> 12:37.999
He always had it with him.

12:37.999 --> 12:40.499
The key was at his house.

12:40.499 --> 12:42.540
That means\Nhe went back home.

12:44.670 --> 12:46.879
You have a hunch,\Ndon't you?

12:48.040 --> 12:49.280
I think...

12:49.379 --> 12:50.450
(Manager Jo)

12:51.910 --> 12:54.019
I have to buy paper cups\Nfor the office pantry.

12:54.780 --> 12:56.050
I have to go first.

12:58.019 --> 12:59.249
Isn't she fast?

12:59.920 --> 13:00.989
She is.

13:02.359 --> 13:03.930
Goodness.

13:05.790 --> 13:06.900
Aren't you going back\Nto the station?

13:08.599 --> 13:10.269
I have to go catch\Nperverts.

13:10.269 --> 13:11.530
Where can I find them?

13:12.869 --> 13:15.540
What did you do wrong? Why\Ndoes Manager Jo hate you?

13:15.869 --> 13:17.170
You also think\Nhe hates me, right?

13:17.540 --> 13:20.780
I think\Nthe chief likes me,

13:20.780 --> 13:22.879
but the manager is\Ninterrupting things.

13:22.879 --> 13:25.180
He doesn't want me\Nto be on the chief's side.

13:25.180 --> 13:26.320
Am I right?

13:28.420 --> 13:30.450
Tell the lady...

13:30.450 --> 13:34.219
that I told her everything\NI remember.

13:34.219 --> 13:36.989
No use.\NI know her really well.

13:37.430 --> 13:38.629
She's got you\Nin her hands...

13:38.629 --> 13:40.460
until the case is solved.

13:41.099 --> 13:43.629
You're the one\Nwho is in her hands.

13:43.629 --> 13:44.629
Not me.

13:44.629 --> 13:47.969
Hey, I'm not in her hands.

13:47.969 --> 13:50.109
Whatever. I'm leaving.

13:57.379 --> 14:00.920
Hey.\NYou keep calling her lady,

14:01.249 --> 14:03.589
but she's the employee\Nof this police station.

14:04.950 --> 14:05.950
Go.

14:11.389 --> 14:13.160
Did you find\Nany fingerprints?

14:14.759 --> 14:16.769
I can't find any.

14:16.769 --> 14:17.769
Nonsense!

14:19.400 --> 14:21.040
A number of fingerprints\Nwhich you have to find...

14:22.940 --> 14:24.540
are 5 of yours,\N3 of Yoo Seol Ok's,

14:24.540 --> 14:25.969
and four of\NConstable Shin's.

14:27.280 --> 14:29.540
- What?\N- You made...

14:29.540 --> 14:31.080
three overlapping\Nfingerprints...

14:31.080 --> 14:32.180
which I hate the most.

14:32.479 --> 14:33.680
It's in the order of...

14:33.680 --> 14:35.420
Kim Kyung Mi, Yoo Seol Ok,\Nand Constable Shin.

14:35.420 --> 14:36.519
Especially\Nfor Constable Shin,

14:36.950 --> 14:39.619
she touched here and there\Nincluding this button pad.

15:13.759 --> 15:14.759
Well...

15:15.460 --> 15:17.389
Where's Seol Ok?

15:17.690 --> 15:19.190
She'll be here soon.

15:20.060 --> 15:21.999
Kim Kyung Mi handed it\Nto Yoo Seol Ok.

15:21.999 --> 15:24.330
Then Constable Shin\Nturned on this flashlight.

15:24.599 --> 15:26.639
You're not\Ncreative at all.

15:26.639 --> 15:28.469
To solve\Nthis sloppy crime case,

15:28.469 --> 15:31.310
I wasted\Nall my morning time.

15:31.540 --> 15:33.009
I'm sorry,\NProfessor Hwang.

15:34.040 --> 15:36.680
I had no idea you'd even\Nfind those fingerprints.

15:41.680 --> 15:42.680
Of course,

15:43.550 --> 15:46.889
you wouldn't have imagined\Nthat I'd be this skilled.

15:49.989 --> 15:50.989
No.

15:52.900 --> 15:54.300
If we had known\Nthat you'd find...

15:54.300 --> 15:55.629
overlapping fingerprints\Nlike these,

15:55.700 --> 15:58.430
we wouldn't have\Ndared try it.

16:09.780 --> 16:12.050
- Ah Ram.\N- Daddy.

16:14.820 --> 16:16.290
What did you do\Nin school today?

16:16.290 --> 16:18.489
I played weather\Nforecasting and dictation.

16:18.920 --> 16:21.160
It means\Nyou studied a lot.

16:21.389 --> 16:23.859
Should I buy you\Nsome chicken today then?

16:24.560 --> 16:25.960
- No.\N- Why not?

16:25.960 --> 16:28.099
I know you don't have\Nmuch money in your pocket.

16:28.359 --> 16:30.229
Who told you that?\NYour mommy?

16:31.129 --> 16:32.670
Why that woman...

16:33.300 --> 16:34.869
I have a lot of money.

16:34.869 --> 16:37.810
I can buy everything you\Nwant to eat and have.

16:37.810 --> 16:39.170
- Really?\N- Sure.

16:39.170 --> 16:40.339
Then I want chicken.

16:40.339 --> 16:42.710
Chicken sounds good.\NLet's go.

16:46.180 --> 16:48.479
- Bye.\N- Bye.

16:48.479 --> 16:50.119
(Fried Chicken)

16:56.729 --> 16:57.790
What are you looking at?

16:58.359 --> 17:00.060
There's a strange man\Nover there.

17:01.229 --> 17:02.229
What?

17:03.030 --> 17:04.999
I take that path when I go\Nfor my private lessons,

17:04.999 --> 17:07.239
and I see a strange man\Nwhenever I pass there.

17:08.339 --> 17:09.339
Kid.

17:38.229 --> 17:40.069
When I pass by,\Nhe puts down his pants.

17:40.700 --> 17:42.170
He's naked,\Nand it's embarrassing.

17:42.499 --> 17:44.870
- It's funny, right?\N- Yes.

18:07.400 --> 18:08.400
Look.

18:08.700 --> 18:10.670
How can you do such a poor\Njob in patrolling alleys?

18:12.170 --> 18:14.799
Well, we're doing\Nit regularly.

18:14.799 --> 18:15.969
And it's not helping\Nat all.

18:15.969 --> 18:18.809
Perverts are at every\Nalley in our town.

18:18.809 --> 18:20.739
We haven't gotten\Nany report.

18:21.210 --> 18:22.739
Kids don't know anything.

18:22.739 --> 18:24.880
They can't report\Nabout this.

18:25.180 --> 18:27.319
Well, we can't patrol\Nevery alleyway...

18:27.319 --> 18:28.950
when there hasn't been\Nany report.

18:28.950 --> 18:30.519
Even so,

18:30.890 --> 18:32.049
you have to patrol...

18:33.219 --> 18:34.920
Goodness! Seriously.

18:35.989 --> 18:37.259
Darn it.

18:39.090 --> 18:40.100
Gosh.

18:42.130 --> 18:44.200
Did you find any suspect\Nof the studio murder case?

18:46.440 --> 18:47.440
Sergeant Yuk.

18:49.870 --> 18:50.969
Not yet.

18:54.009 --> 18:56.210
It can become a long-term\Ncold case at this rate.

18:57.680 --> 19:00.920
Why can't we see\Nany progress?

19:01.779 --> 19:03.289
- Corporal Gong.\N- Yes?

19:03.620 --> 19:05.620
Are you helping out\Nwith the case?

19:06.420 --> 19:09.219
I'm investigating on\Nthe paternity case.

19:09.219 --> 19:10.360
What is it about?

19:10.860 --> 19:12.329
There's a man\Nwho puts down his pants...

19:12.329 --> 19:14.329
at the alleyway near\Nthe elementary school.

19:14.400 --> 19:15.499
The pervert\Nin a trench coat?

19:16.900 --> 19:18.499
This isn't time for that.

19:18.499 --> 19:21.200
It's near the elementary\Nschool, so it's dangerous.

19:21.299 --> 19:23.610
It isn't the same as\Nthe matter of death.

19:23.840 --> 19:26.640
What if he turns into\Na child molester?

19:27.009 --> 19:28.180
I get it,

19:28.180 --> 19:30.110
but we are...

19:30.410 --> 19:31.910
already having\Na headache...

19:31.910 --> 19:33.719
for what we're\Nburdened with!

19:35.880 --> 19:36.890
Well...

19:37.489 --> 19:38.989
Call the patrol division,

19:39.190 --> 19:40.960
and tell them to reinforce\Ntheir patrolling.

19:40.960 --> 19:41.989
Take your hands off then.

19:41.989 --> 19:44.329
We should be catching\Nhim as detectives.

19:44.329 --> 19:46.630
There are so many of them.

19:46.860 --> 19:47.960
If we catch all of them,

19:47.960 --> 19:49.529
the station won't be\Nable to function.

19:49.529 --> 19:51.499
Why are you taking\Nit out on me?

19:51.499 --> 19:53.370
I'm just telling you\Nthe reality.

19:53.370 --> 19:54.840
They think they can\Ncatch all culprits...

19:54.840 --> 19:56.170
if they\Nput their mind to it.

19:56.610 --> 19:58.069
Then who will catch\Nthose perverts?

19:59.640 --> 20:01.340
Elementary students can't\Ncatch them themselves.

20:01.809 --> 20:03.110
Should the students\Non duty catch them?

20:03.910 --> 20:06.210
Who on earth can catch\Nthem if the police don't?

20:06.819 --> 20:07.819
Darn it.

20:08.620 --> 20:09.690
Darn it!

20:11.819 --> 20:12.819
Gosh.

20:16.120 --> 20:17.930
(Unit for Catching\NPerverts)

20:21.729 --> 20:23.769
I'm applying\Nfor your unit right now.

20:27.269 --> 20:30.809
(Unit for Catching\NPerverts)

20:30.809 --> 20:32.009
Can't I join?

20:32.009 --> 20:33.309
We need resources,

20:33.309 --> 20:34.840
so there's no reason\Nnot to accept you.

20:35.410 --> 20:36.410
But why all of a sudden?

20:36.880 --> 20:39.150
Why do you want to\Nswitch units?

20:39.410 --> 20:40.420
Well...

20:41.279 --> 20:42.519
Because of this.

20:42.519 --> 20:45.190
I must catch that punk\Nno matter what.

20:45.190 --> 20:47.319
Are you here\Nto catch perverts?

20:47.719 --> 20:50.690
You said they'll get away\Nby paying a bit of fine.

20:50.690 --> 20:51.690
Well...

20:52.529 --> 20:54.559
Still, the police\Nshould catch them.

20:54.630 --> 20:55.759
Goodness.

20:56.029 --> 20:57.769
Anyway, welcome.

20:57.769 --> 20:58.769
Thank you.

20:58.930 --> 21:00.499
I'll use this desk.

21:04.739 --> 21:05.739
Goodness.

21:10.749 --> 21:12.210
Why did you buy\Nso many cups?

21:12.450 --> 21:14.279
I just bought\Nenough of them.

21:14.979 --> 21:16.150
It's here.

21:20.759 --> 21:22.759
My wedding\Nis coming up soon.

21:22.789 --> 21:24.430
There are much more to\Nprepare than I expected.

21:24.590 --> 21:27.029
It must be hard to\Nprepare for it alone.

21:27.299 --> 21:30.299
Usually, the bride's\Nmother helps her.

21:30.430 --> 21:33.299
My mom doesn't come\Nout of the house.

21:34.039 --> 21:35.969
We actually skipped\Nthe parents' meeting too.

21:36.309 --> 21:37.769
I feel so apologetic\Nto my fiance.

21:39.579 --> 21:41.479
We should find\Nyour father soon.

21:41.710 --> 21:42.710
Right.

21:43.110 --> 21:46.380
That way, I think I can\Nget married in peace.

21:47.549 --> 21:49.749
Why did you want to\Nsee me, by the way?

21:51.319 --> 21:53.019
Before your father\Nwent missing,

21:53.259 --> 21:54.719
he borrowed a book.

21:55.059 --> 21:56.190
Do you know\Nabout that book?

21:56.289 --> 21:57.329
A book?

21:57.960 --> 22:00.499
I'd never seen him\Nread any book.

22:01.630 --> 22:03.469
There was no book\Nin the storage either.

22:06.469 --> 22:08.499
There were some books.

22:11.440 --> 22:13.340
(Holy Bible)

22:13.340 --> 22:14.340
(New Joongjin Church)

22:14.340 --> 22:16.180
He came to our church\Nevery Sunday.

22:16.450 --> 22:18.079
I got to work at\NMr. Jang's office...

22:18.079 --> 22:19.650
thanks to that connection.

22:21.219 --> 22:23.890
Are you the man\Nwho saw the key chain?

22:23.890 --> 22:24.890
Yes.

22:25.150 --> 22:26.150
By the way,

22:26.489 --> 22:28.519
why did you\Ngo there at 5am?

22:28.519 --> 22:30.259
I worked there then.

22:31.059 --> 22:32.390
Isn't it too early\Nfor work?

22:32.390 --> 22:33.930
I saw it\Non my way to church.

22:33.930 --> 22:35.559
I was late for\Nthe early morning service,

22:35.559 --> 22:36.799
so I was running.

22:36.799 --> 22:38.529
Then I saw how\Nthe office door was open.

22:38.529 --> 22:40.170
I went to check\Nif the office was burgled.

22:40.170 --> 22:43.110
I felt relieved after\Nseeing his key chain.

22:44.569 --> 22:45.840
Hello, ma'am.

22:46.509 --> 22:47.509
Hello.

22:47.509 --> 22:48.509
She's the madam...

22:48.509 --> 22:49.539
of Yongmyung Human\NResources Office.

22:49.809 --> 22:51.749
- Oh, that office.\N- I see.

22:51.749 --> 22:53.579
It's owned\Nby Mr. Jang's partner,

22:53.680 --> 22:55.049
- the boxer.\N- Right.

22:55.279 --> 22:56.690
My colleagues\Noften go to...

22:56.690 --> 22:59.150
her restaurant\Nfor their meals.

22:59.150 --> 23:00.519
She must know well.

23:09.400 --> 23:12.329
When was the last time\Nyou saw Mr. Jang?

23:12.999 --> 23:15.900
He came to have a meal\Nwith his colleagues.

23:17.910 --> 23:19.880
Did you find anything\Nunusual from him?

23:20.410 --> 23:22.239
Well... Not really.

23:22.910 --> 23:25.279
You must like\Nreading novels.

23:25.450 --> 23:27.749
Yes, I like to read\Nromance novels.

23:30.620 --> 23:33.489
You often met with\NMr. Jang, didn't you?

23:35.390 --> 23:36.390
No.

23:37.630 --> 23:39.600
Why would I?

23:39.600 --> 23:41.229
Didn't you see him often\Nat church?

23:41.630 --> 23:44.600
We heard that you two went\Nto church every Sunday.

23:45.299 --> 23:46.299
Well...

23:46.799 --> 23:49.440
I saw him at church\Nof course.

24:00.420 --> 24:02.420
Why are you pestering her\Nat work?

24:02.420 --> 24:05.049
We're investigating\NMr. Jang's missing case.

24:05.219 --> 24:08.190
That happened ages ago.\NStop bothering her!

24:10.229 --> 24:12.860
I don't know anything.

24:12.860 --> 24:14.200
Please leave now.

24:14.759 --> 24:15.829
Go.

24:21.069 --> 24:22.440
What are they doing here?

24:22.910 --> 24:24.069
Did you call them?

24:24.069 --> 24:26.640
No, I really didn't.

24:31.380 --> 24:32.549
That was suspicious.

24:32.549 --> 24:34.350
Something feels\Nreally fish in here.

24:34.350 --> 24:35.549
I have a feeling.

24:50.499 --> 24:52.069
You have to keep\Nyour eyes on Chief Shin.

24:52.069 --> 24:53.370
Why are you outside?

24:53.840 --> 24:55.370
I turned down clients\Nbecause of you...

24:55.370 --> 24:56.539
I'm on my way back.

24:57.769 --> 25:00.140
I don't care about\NChief Shin. I'm leaving.

25:00.880 --> 25:02.950
I can only play a few\Nrounds of losing games.

25:02.950 --> 25:05.579
Just stall him\Nfor a little bit. Okay.

25:07.579 --> 25:09.150
I have to go back\Nto the station.

25:09.350 --> 25:10.420
Will you be okay\Nby yourself?

25:10.420 --> 25:11.489
Don't worry.

25:11.489 --> 25:14.360
I'll make sure I resolve\Nthis missing case.

25:18.160 --> 25:20.829
Yes, Manager Jo.\NAbout the tonic...

25:20.829 --> 25:22.430
My plants are dying.

25:22.430 --> 25:24.670
Did you go to Indonesia\Nto get the tonic?

25:24.670 --> 25:26.029
Where are you?

25:26.029 --> 25:28.469
I went to Dongmun Market,\Nthe biggest one around,

25:28.469 --> 25:30.069
but the store was closed,

25:30.069 --> 25:32.069
so I had to come back\Nto Joongjin Market.

25:32.309 --> 25:35.809
It always takes you\Nforever to do something.

25:35.809 --> 25:37.610
If any of my plants die,

25:37.610 --> 25:39.779
I'm going to make you\Npay for their funeral.

25:39.779 --> 25:42.680
Yes, I'll be there soon.\NOkay.

25:43.319 --> 25:46.090
You still deal with people\Nlike your old in-laws.

25:46.090 --> 25:47.890

I've been a detective\Nfor 10 years,

26:03.710 --> 26:05.769
but it's my first time\Nstaking out at a station.

26:08.210 --> 26:10.150
Why did she\Ngo to a hospital?

26:13.420 --> 26:14.450
Hello?

26:16.049 --> 26:17.819
He won't come out.

26:17.819 --> 26:19.450
I have no idea\Nwhat he's up to.

26:19.860 --> 26:21.219
He won't come out.

26:29.460 --> 26:30.529
He just came out.

26:37.940 --> 26:38.940
Goodbye.

26:41.739 --> 26:43.279
Hey, wait.

26:43.279 --> 26:45.249
- What?\N- Go to the hospital.

26:45.979 --> 26:46.979
Why should I?

26:46.979 --> 26:49.120
I got a call that\NMs. Lee is hospitalized.

26:49.749 --> 26:51.390
I think her husband\Ndid that to her.

26:51.749 --> 26:53.620
I mean, it's dangerous\Nfor Ms. Yoo to be alone.

26:53.620 --> 26:56.090
Please, I ask of you.

26:56.090 --> 26:57.590
And throw this away too.

27:01.499 --> 27:02.969
I can't believe this.

27:02.969 --> 27:05.430
Wan Seung just\Nasked me for a favor.

27:10.809 --> 27:12.539
Why couldn't\Nhe throw this away?

27:21.249 --> 27:23.289
Hey, Mr. Gye.

27:24.090 --> 27:25.719
How did you know\Nwe were here?

27:28.789 --> 27:30.660
Are you here\Nto resolve this case?

27:30.660 --> 27:32.759
Well, something like that.

27:34.160 --> 27:35.660
What happened?

27:35.960 --> 27:39.430
I slipped and fell.

27:42.700 --> 27:45.569
This hospital is the same\Nas the past.

27:46.979 --> 27:49.579
You were at this hospital\Nseven years ago...

27:49.880 --> 27:51.380
when you slipped and fell.

27:51.910 --> 27:53.019
Right?

27:55.180 --> 27:57.090
I can see\Nyour chart to check.

28:02.289 --> 28:05.590
That means Mr. Gi\Nassaults her habitually.

28:15.269 --> 28:16.910
Put that over there.

28:16.910 --> 28:18.840
Make sure it looks pretty.

28:18.840 --> 28:21.279
And make sure\Nthe microphone...

28:21.279 --> 28:23.309
doesn't echo too much.

28:23.509 --> 28:26.549
You should've made\Nthe banner bigger. Gosh.

28:26.549 --> 28:28.019
Get a new one.

28:28.850 --> 28:31.190
Let me see\Nthe seating chart.

28:32.749 --> 28:35.059
Did you get this\Nfrom the reception?

28:35.489 --> 28:37.489
This is\Nthe most important. Okay?

28:37.489 --> 28:39.559
Take this seating chart...

28:39.559 --> 28:41.999
and put name cards\Non the chairs.

28:42.529 --> 28:45.170
Don't you guys\Nclean these chairs?

28:49.269 --> 28:50.640
I don't think it's today.

28:51.539 --> 28:53.410
There's some\Nopening ceremony,

28:53.410 --> 28:54.809
and he's focused on that.

28:56.850 --> 28:57.910
Okay.

29:02.180 --> 29:04.319
Hey, Mr. Gye.\NWhere's the lady?

29:05.019 --> 29:06.319
Keep your eyes on her.

29:06.319 --> 29:07.960
You can never tell\Nwhat she'll do.

29:10.390 --> 29:11.690
He's ordering me\Naround again.

29:13.029 --> 29:15.100
Why should I do that?

29:16.029 --> 29:18.529
I have a lot of\Nserious crime cases.

29:19.430 --> 29:21.999
I have no time\Nfor the case...

29:24.009 --> 29:25.269
from seven years ago.

29:29.110 --> 29:31.079
Then you can come\Nand watch them yourself.

29:39.120 --> 29:42.559
He'll find me and kill me\Nno matter where I am.

29:42.559 --> 29:44.329
We'll make sure\Nhe doesn't do that.

29:44.329 --> 29:46.400
You can't live\Nlike this forever.

29:47.660 --> 29:49.029
Darn it!

29:51.569 --> 29:53.239
What brings you\Nhere again?

29:53.900 --> 29:57.539
Why do you keep coming\Nto ask my wife...

29:57.539 --> 30:00.140
about that missing guy?

30:03.079 --> 30:04.249
Mr. Gi.

30:05.079 --> 30:06.880
You're under arrest\Nfor violating...

30:06.880 --> 30:08.579
the law on\Ndomestic violence...

30:09.249 --> 30:10.450
by assaulting\Nand injuring her.

30:11.049 --> 30:12.120
What?

30:18.630 --> 30:20.600
I'm glad\Nyou gave up on boxing.

30:20.799 --> 30:22.729
You don't have\Nmuch talent...

30:22.930 --> 30:24.569
other than\Nbeating up women.

30:25.069 --> 30:26.130
Let go of me.

30:28.299 --> 30:29.400
Let go.

30:36.380 --> 30:37.509
Great job.

30:38.110 --> 30:39.309
Don't mention it.

30:40.380 --> 30:41.880
Of course,\Na detective should...

30:41.880 --> 30:43.650
catch criminals and\Nprotect civilians.

30:43.650 --> 30:45.249
I didn't do this\Nbecause you asked.

30:46.920 --> 30:49.259
Hey, by the way,

30:50.259 --> 30:51.390
are you two dating?

30:52.489 --> 30:55.059
I'm only protecting\Na civilian as a detective.

30:55.059 --> 30:56.469
Are you insane?\NWe're not dating.

30:57.029 --> 30:58.100
Really?

30:58.729 --> 31:00.170
I was thinking\Nabout asking her out.

31:00.170 --> 31:02.100
I don't mind that\Nshe was once divorced.

31:02.910 --> 31:03.910
Hey.

31:04.769 --> 31:07.140
Are you insane?\NHave you gone crazy?

31:07.140 --> 31:08.239
What?

31:08.779 --> 31:11.079
I'm just joking.\NWhy are you all worked up?

31:12.650 --> 31:14.749
I guess Ms. Yoo\Nisn't just a civilian.

31:14.749 --> 31:18.549
I can tell by the way\Nyou're all worked up.

31:18.549 --> 31:19.960
I'm not worked up.

31:20.190 --> 31:22.090
I'm just worried\Nabout you...

31:22.090 --> 31:24.489
Hey, date her.\NJust go date that lady!

31:24.489 --> 31:25.890
You can date her.\NDate her!

31:26.360 --> 31:28.229
- Who am I dating now?\N- My gosh.

31:29.229 --> 31:30.370
Where did you come from?

31:32.130 --> 31:34.499
You aren't the only lady\Nin this world.

31:34.640 --> 31:36.170
There's someone else.

31:36.910 --> 31:39.710
Mr. Gye wants to date\Nsome lady.

31:39.710 --> 31:41.940
Really? That's a surprise.

31:42.039 --> 31:44.049
I thought he would like\Nyoung women.

31:45.779 --> 31:47.979
- Can you tell?\N- At one glance.

31:48.450 --> 31:49.519
Really?

31:49.719 --> 31:52.219
Yes, right.\NHe likes girl groups.

31:55.559 --> 31:57.489
There's the chief.\NSee you tomorrow.

32:00.460 --> 32:03.670
He must be determined\Nto suck up to him.

32:09.739 --> 32:11.009
Yes, Secretary Kim.

32:11.610 --> 32:12.739
On Thursday?

32:13.440 --> 32:14.739
See you then.

32:37.200 --> 32:39.569
What? He's gone home.

32:40.769 --> 32:43.309
Is he meeting Secretary\NKim next Thursday?

32:55.779 --> 32:57.150
This is so uncomfortable.

32:57.890 --> 32:59.289
I want to be alone.

33:04.430 --> 33:05.930
Should I just\Ngo to a sauna?

33:07.130 --> 33:08.400
He always frowns,

33:08.400 --> 33:09.700
and I have no idea\Nwhat's on his mind.

33:10.499 --> 33:11.630
We can't get along.

33:13.170 --> 33:16.069
I really want to be\Nleft alone. How annoying.

33:18.969 --> 33:20.039
Hello.

33:21.239 --> 33:23.549
You come home\Nevery single night.

33:23.549 --> 33:25.309
That's a good habit.

33:51.410 --> 33:52.840
There's nothing to eat.

33:54.210 --> 33:55.610
Do you need anything?

33:56.279 --> 33:58.009
I'm going out\Nto shop for groceries.

33:58.079 --> 33:59.380
Don't worry about me.

33:59.509 --> 34:00.920
I'll get my own.

34:01.150 --> 34:02.549
Thank goodness.

34:04.650 --> 34:05.650
By the way,

34:06.049 --> 34:08.489
I don't know\Nwhere the supermarket is.

34:08.860 --> 34:09.860
Can we go together?

34:11.429 --> 34:12.460
Sure.

34:31.510 --> 34:32.510
Gosh.

34:45.228 --> 34:46.228
Thanks.

35:10.820 --> 35:11.820
Lady, what is it?

35:14.289 --> 35:15.360
Where are you?

35:16.630 --> 35:17.760
You didn't go home yet?

35:18.159 --> 35:20.400
No. I'm with Mr. Gye.

35:21.400 --> 35:23.670
Why is he there with you?

35:24.269 --> 35:26.300
You told me not to go\Non my own.

35:26.499 --> 35:27.999
Are you coming or not?

35:28.539 --> 35:30.710
Why would I go there?

35:44.389 --> 35:45.720
It's all done.

35:46.190 --> 35:47.860
You can stay there\Nfor a while.

35:49.389 --> 35:50.590
Thank you.

35:51.630 --> 35:52.860
Ms. Lee Yeong Sook.

35:53.360 --> 35:54.829
You're hiding something,\Naren't you?

35:57.369 --> 35:59.269
What was\Nyour relationship...

36:00.199 --> 36:01.539
with Jang Myung Hoon\Nwho's gone missing?

36:05.210 --> 36:08.510
He didn't normally\Nread books.

36:09.179 --> 36:11.780
But every Saturday,\Nhe borrowed books.

36:12.650 --> 36:14.380
Before he went missing,

36:14.380 --> 36:16.590
he borrowed books\Non Saturdays.

36:16.590 --> 36:18.650
I remember because\Nhe was a regular.

36:19.590 --> 36:22.820
It's because you liked\Nreading books.

36:24.030 --> 36:26.300
You must like\Nreading novels.

36:26.760 --> 36:29.099
Yes, I like to read\Nromance novels.

36:30.929 --> 36:34.139
Jang Myung Hoon went to\Nchurch every Sunday...

36:34.869 --> 36:37.440
to give you books,\Ndidn't he?

36:46.519 --> 36:48.150
Read this.

36:49.019 --> 36:50.019
Pardon?

36:56.630 --> 36:58.490
He was a good man.

37:07.670 --> 37:08.670
Lady.

37:09.170 --> 37:10.639
Why did you call him?

37:11.010 --> 37:12.610
Because you said\Nyou wouldn't come.

37:13.679 --> 37:16.749
I guess you came running\Nafter getting her call.

37:17.210 --> 37:18.409
It looks like...

37:18.409 --> 37:20.349
you came running too.

37:20.349 --> 37:23.050
This lady here sent me...

37:24.220 --> 37:25.920
57 text messages.

37:28.260 --> 37:30.159
Please leave me alone,\Nwill you?

37:30.490 --> 37:32.860
You take care\Nof your lady.

37:33.999 --> 37:37.900
Lady, why did you send\N57 text messages?

37:38.970 --> 37:40.740
He's the only one...

37:40.740 --> 37:42.300
who knows about this case.

37:42.300 --> 37:43.570
I'm busy.

37:44.039 --> 37:45.039
Let's do this quickly.

37:49.679 --> 37:53.220
You know\Nwhat your husband did...

37:53.679 --> 37:54.720
to Jang Myung Hoon.

37:58.590 --> 38:00.860
Jang Myung Hoon's blood\Nwas detected...

38:01.220 --> 38:03.889
from Gi Yong Seob's\Nclothes back then.

38:14.570 --> 38:16.199
What's going on?\NWho are you?

38:16.199 --> 38:17.269
Search the place!

38:17.269 --> 38:18.269
Yes, sir.

38:20.139 --> 38:21.780
What are you doing?

38:23.280 --> 38:26.420
Sir, I think this is\NGi Yong Seob's jacket.

38:32.960 --> 38:34.519
Why was Jang\NMyung Hoon's blood...

38:34.889 --> 38:36.829
on your husband's jacket?

38:39.159 --> 38:40.630
You said your husband...

38:40.630 --> 38:42.229
helped Jang Myung Hoon\Nwho got hurt at work...

38:42.800 --> 38:44.470
and got his jacket\Nstained.

38:46.970 --> 38:47.970
Ms. Lee Yeong Sook.

38:49.139 --> 38:50.210
That was a lie, wasn't it?

38:54.240 --> 38:55.309
My husband...

38:56.710 --> 38:58.979
hit Jang Myung Hoon...

39:00.280 --> 39:02.519
after seeing us\Nleave the church together.

39:04.820 --> 39:06.360
- Why you...\N- Wait.

39:07.360 --> 39:08.619
You jerk!

39:08.619 --> 39:10.190
She was having\Na hard time!

39:10.490 --> 39:11.630
Stop.

39:12.429 --> 39:13.800
She was having\Na hard time?

39:15.360 --> 39:16.729
Oh, no...

39:16.729 --> 39:19.369
Was your husband\Nsuspicious of you two?

39:20.470 --> 39:22.099
He had terrible\Ndelusional jealousy.

39:22.599 --> 39:24.740
He was jealous\Nof every man I met.

39:26.139 --> 39:28.840
I couldn't go anywhere\Nexcept the restaurant...

39:29.679 --> 39:31.650
and the church on Sundays.

39:32.650 --> 39:34.780
I don't think he was\Ncompletely delusional.

39:36.550 --> 39:39.190
The novel Mr. Jang\Nborrowed...

39:40.119 --> 39:41.820
before he went missing...

39:42.260 --> 39:43.960
was found in your\Nrestaurant fridge.

39:44.559 --> 39:45.990
"Waiting Room"...

39:47.159 --> 39:48.229
was the title...

39:49.030 --> 39:50.070
of that book.

39:57.740 --> 39:58.940
("Waiting Room")

40:06.720 --> 40:07.749
What's this?

40:09.820 --> 40:12.090
I guess he left it here\Nwhen he came to eat.

40:13.090 --> 40:15.720
I might've put\Na mackerel on there...

40:16.289 --> 40:17.990
and put them both in\Nby mistake.

40:21.729 --> 40:25.130
It didn't look like\Na mackerel was on there.

40:29.039 --> 40:30.610
We should find...

40:31.309 --> 40:32.570
Jang Myung Hoon now,

40:33.309 --> 40:34.780
whether he's dead\Nor alive.

40:43.990 --> 40:46.590
I liked him.

40:48.590 --> 40:50.490
(New Joongjin Church)

40:54.059 --> 40:55.059
There you go.

40:55.059 --> 40:56.329
("Smiling for Me")

40:57.269 --> 40:58.970
I couldn't go to\Na bookstore...

40:58.970 --> 41:00.240
because of my husband.

41:00.900 --> 41:03.369
But he lent me books\Nevery Sunday.

41:04.070 --> 41:07.139
He even bought me coffee\Nafter church service.

41:08.510 --> 41:09.679
Even if it was brief,

41:09.679 --> 41:11.349
when I was\Ntalking with him,

41:13.050 --> 41:14.949
time went by so quickly.

41:16.119 --> 41:19.349
When was the last time\Nyou saw Mr. Jang?

41:20.789 --> 41:22.019
Sunday night.

41:25.190 --> 41:27.159
Today is the day...

41:28.099 --> 41:29.729
to make your decision.

41:31.570 --> 41:32.599
I will.

41:33.999 --> 41:35.240
That was the first time...

41:35.940 --> 41:38.440
in my life to pluck up\Nmy courage.

41:44.550 --> 41:45.849
Mr. Jang and I...

41:46.449 --> 41:48.619
were going to run away.

42:09.340 --> 42:10.809
Was that the last time?

42:12.269 --> 42:13.280
Yes.

42:27.559 --> 42:29.630
Mr. Jang's blood was\Nfound.

42:30.059 --> 42:32.490
The case was\Npointing to murder.

42:32.760 --> 42:34.329
But why was it concluded\Ninternally?

42:34.630 --> 42:36.199
We couldn't find\Nthe body...

42:37.170 --> 42:38.199
anywhere.

42:39.639 --> 42:41.039
What's going on?\NWho are you?

42:41.039 --> 42:42.400
Search the place!

42:42.400 --> 42:43.409
Yes, sir.

42:46.639 --> 42:47.639
Hey.

42:51.610 --> 42:52.610
Goodness.

43:06.999 --> 43:08.260
Check the bathroom.

43:08.999 --> 43:10.170
Check this room also.

43:23.510 --> 43:24.610
Without a body...

43:24.610 --> 43:26.820
You couldn't\Ninvestigate further.

43:27.119 --> 43:29.720
You can't prove murder\Njust with blood stain.

43:31.090 --> 43:34.990
I told you everything\NI remember.

43:34.990 --> 43:37.090
And I saved your number\Nas spam.

43:37.329 --> 43:38.429
I knew it.

43:38.789 --> 43:39.999
You never pick up\Nmy calls.

43:40.260 --> 43:43.269
Don't look so smug\Nfor helping with the case.

43:46.340 --> 43:47.340
I'll get going now.

43:51.809 --> 43:53.710
Lady. Are you a stalker?

43:54.010 --> 43:56.010
Why did you send\Nso many text messages?

43:59.249 --> 44:01.550
Things were hard after\Nmy father collapsed.

44:02.280 --> 44:03.949
If it hadn't been for you,

44:03.949 --> 44:05.619
I wouldn't have been\Nable to put up with it.

44:07.389 --> 44:09.019
I didn't do\Nanything though.

44:12.659 --> 44:15.030
You can go back to\NHa and Jung Law Firm.

44:15.030 --> 44:16.729
The other attorneys\Nas well.

44:17.470 --> 44:20.369
What about my kid's\Ncollege entrance problem?

44:22.199 --> 44:24.010
Was there such a problem?

44:25.340 --> 44:27.380
I've never\Nheard about it before.

44:31.880 --> 44:33.479
I'll go back to\NHa and Jung Law Firm.

44:34.849 --> 44:37.889
But why on earth\Nare you doing this?

44:38.449 --> 44:40.420
You told us to go to\Nanother law firm before.

44:41.690 --> 44:43.789
There's no law firm\Nas good as Ha and Jung.

44:51.170 --> 44:52.269
Hee Yeon.

44:59.780 --> 45:00.840
I have to give this\Nto you...

45:00.840 --> 45:01.940
while I have the courage.

45:11.519 --> 45:13.420
It's my mother's ring.

45:27.999 --> 45:29.499
Ha and Jung Law Firm.

46:37.309 --> 46:38.340
Where are they going?

46:38.970 --> 46:40.110
He looked for me?

46:40.110 --> 46:42.010
Right, he came here\Nto look for you.

46:42.510 --> 46:44.010
He asked questions\Nabout you,

46:44.010 --> 46:46.110
and it seemed\Na bit strange.

46:52.289 --> 46:53.920
Whom are you here to meet?

46:54.289 --> 46:55.860
I know you're\Nafter something.

46:55.860 --> 46:57.329
Is that right?

46:57.659 --> 46:59.190
What am I after?

47:06.199 --> 47:08.170
There was\NHa Wan Seung everywhere.

47:09.039 --> 47:11.110
Seo Hyun Soo,\NSecretary Kim,

47:11.110 --> 47:12.909
Ha Ji Seung,\Nand Yoo Seol Ok.

47:18.110 --> 47:19.179
Right.

47:19.920 --> 47:21.019
He went missing...

47:22.249 --> 47:23.420
on Sunday.

47:25.190 --> 47:28.460
If that's the case,\NJang Myung Hoon...

47:32.389 --> 47:33.429
Right.

47:34.460 --> 47:35.530
That's it.

47:43.970 --> 47:45.539
Why did you call me\Nout this early?

47:45.740 --> 47:48.979
It was only on Sunday\Nwhen Mr. Jang was spotted.

47:50.150 --> 47:53.050
The woman next door could\Nnot see his face clearly.

47:53.050 --> 47:54.449
She only guessed.

47:55.449 --> 47:58.849
That man came out with\Na huge suitcase at dawn.

47:58.949 --> 48:01.519
I thought he was\Ngoing on a trip.

48:01.519 --> 48:03.260
The employee of the\Nhuman resources office...

48:03.260 --> 48:04.929
only saw his key chain.

48:04.929 --> 48:06.559
Then I saw how\Nthe office door was open.

48:06.559 --> 48:08.229
I went to check\Nif the office was burgled.

48:08.229 --> 48:11.300
I felt relieved after\Nseeing his key chain.

48:11.300 --> 48:13.999
Gi Yong Seob was\Nthe last to see him.

48:14.400 --> 48:15.940
The night when\Nhe went missing.

48:15.940 --> 48:17.539
At around 9pm.

48:17.539 --> 48:19.409
I saw him enter his house.

48:19.740 --> 48:22.340
Then Mr. Jang\Nwent missing.

48:23.949 --> 48:25.249
Sunday...

48:27.579 --> 48:30.650
Then Lee Yeong Sook could\Nbe the last to see him.

48:30.650 --> 48:31.650
What?

48:33.619 --> 48:35.119
Come on. It's obvious.

48:37.789 --> 48:38.990
I watched it...

48:39.460 --> 48:41.960
all night long\Nover there in hiding.

48:47.300 --> 48:48.699
How did you know?

48:49.170 --> 48:50.269
The guts?

48:53.679 --> 48:55.380
They promised to risk\Ntheir lives...

48:55.380 --> 48:56.849
and run away together,\Nbut he didn't make it.

48:56.849 --> 48:58.849
Would you go home\Nif it were you?

48:59.479 --> 49:00.749
Wouldn't I?

49:02.220 --> 49:04.119
It wasn't like\NI resented him.

49:05.190 --> 49:07.360
I went there because\NI was worried...

49:07.360 --> 49:08.990
my husband might try\Nto beat him again.

49:32.110 --> 49:34.119
I just wanted to check...

49:37.150 --> 49:40.389
if he really meant it.

49:40.990 --> 49:42.220
The person you're\Ncalling isn't...

49:42.220 --> 49:44.229
I wanted to know\Nat least that.

49:46.499 --> 49:47.599
But...

49:48.599 --> 49:50.570
he didn't come out of\Nthe house all night long.

49:50.699 --> 49:52.269
He didn't answer\Nhis phone either.

49:53.099 --> 49:54.300
At dawn on that day,

49:54.740 --> 49:57.570
someone saw him\Ngo out of the house.

49:59.010 --> 50:02.880
That man came out with\Na huge suitcase at dawn.

50:03.210 --> 50:04.710
Something heavy\Nmust've been in the bag,

50:04.710 --> 50:07.249
but that person struggled\Nso much to carry it.

50:08.349 --> 50:09.849
Who was it?

50:11.090 --> 50:13.720
It was dark, so I\Ncouldn't see it clearly.

50:14.420 --> 50:17.289
But it wasn't\NJang Myung Hoon.

50:18.059 --> 50:20.860
There's no reason I\Nwouldn't recognize him...

50:21.800 --> 50:24.999
because I waited for him\Nthere all night long.

50:25.369 --> 50:26.369
Right.

50:26.740 --> 50:27.840
By any chance,

50:29.570 --> 50:32.909
was it big enough to\Nput a dead body in it?

50:39.650 --> 50:40.679
Yes.

51:04.809 --> 51:06.979
(Joongjin-gu)

51:09.039 --> 51:10.650
Inspector Woo\Nis on the move.

51:10.710 --> 51:12.579
He left the jurisdiction\Nof Joongjin Station.

51:16.019 --> 51:17.789
(Seoul, Gyeonggi Province)

51:20.360 --> 51:22.260
It seems like he's heading\Noutside the city.

51:23.530 --> 51:24.960
This is a message\Nfrom Secretary Kim.

51:24.960 --> 51:27.229
The address\Nis 74, Dansu-ro,

51:27.229 --> 51:29.099
Dongpyeong-gun, Hwaseong,\NGyeonggi Province.

51:29.300 --> 51:30.900
It's a shooting range.

51:31.869 --> 51:34.639
Why does Secretary Kim\Nwant to see me there?

51:35.639 --> 51:38.210
It's number seven.\NCome by a taxi.

51:38.369 --> 51:40.309
What on earth\Nis number seven?

52:07.199 --> 52:09.340
(Hwaseong)

52:33.960 --> 52:35.429
Please go to\Nthe nearby shooting range.

52:40.269 --> 52:41.740
Should I go to\NHwaseong then?

52:42.440 --> 52:43.539
Where in Hwaseong?

52:43.539 --> 52:44.970
The transfer parking lot.

52:45.240 --> 52:46.809
It means he changed cars.

52:46.809 --> 52:48.210
He ran off.

52:48.210 --> 52:50.479
I told you to put it under\Nhis shoe or something.

52:50.479 --> 52:51.979
Inspector Woo\Nisn't like me.

52:51.979 --> 52:54.119
He's got a lot of shoes,\Nso I can't do that.

52:54.119 --> 52:56.050
I'll go through CCTVs\Nin the area.

52:56.050 --> 52:57.220
Start moving for now.

52:57.220 --> 52:58.820
But I don't have\Nany destination.

53:00.260 --> 53:02.289
- Gosh, it's frustrating.\N- Detective Ha.

53:08.860 --> 53:11.070
Lady, I have no time\Nfor this.

53:11.070 --> 53:12.300
I'm busy.

53:12.300 --> 53:14.400
I'm not as heavy\Nas I seem.

53:14.400 --> 53:17.210
The car won't get really\Nslow because of me.

53:17.210 --> 53:18.570
What are you\Ntalking about?

53:30.749 --> 53:33.760
You found Secretary Kim,\Ndidn't you?

53:35.720 --> 53:36.960
How did you know?

53:39.829 --> 53:42.030
You moved your work to\NJoongjin Police Station...

53:42.900 --> 53:44.699
because of Chief Shin.

53:45.829 --> 53:47.970
To find out about\NSecretary Kim.

53:48.769 --> 53:51.139
I heard there are\Na lot of crimes.

53:52.470 --> 53:53.809
While you're at it,

53:53.809 --> 53:55.610
appoint me to\NJoongjin Police Station.

53:56.309 --> 53:57.309
And...

53:57.409 --> 54:00.479
it was so obvious\Nwhen you tried to...

54:00.479 --> 54:01.979
befriend Chief Shin.

54:02.479 --> 54:03.650
Please tell him...

54:04.150 --> 54:06.720
that this is my heart\Ngoing out to him.

54:07.090 --> 54:08.090
Chief Shin.

54:09.490 --> 54:10.490
I hope everything is okay.

54:11.360 --> 54:14.229
Please remember I always\Nhave my eyes on you.

54:14.229 --> 54:16.099
Were you after\NSecretary Kim?

54:16.970 --> 54:20.170
It was weird how you\Nalways disappeared...

54:20.170 --> 54:22.340
when you got a call\Nfrom that guy.

54:22.869 --> 54:23.869
Hey.

54:24.539 --> 54:25.740
I'm on my way back.

54:26.909 --> 54:28.309
Who is he?

54:29.380 --> 54:31.210
Why are you\Nhiding this from me?

54:31.579 --> 54:33.079
Do you not trust me?

54:35.249 --> 54:36.249
Lady.

54:39.760 --> 54:42.090
Detective Ha,\Nthe real culprit...

54:42.619 --> 54:44.659
Yes. I don't.

54:49.670 --> 54:52.229
Mom, no.

54:52.229 --> 54:53.639
I don't care\Nif you trust me.

54:54.099 --> 54:55.599
I am going to\Nfind out the truth...

54:55.970 --> 54:57.510
about my parents' case.

54:58.070 --> 54:59.510
That they didn't\Ncommit suicide.

55:00.039 --> 55:02.979
I've been waiting\Nfor the truth...

55:03.349 --> 55:05.579
as much as you looked\Nfor Seo Hyun Soo.

55:09.050 --> 55:10.050
Hyun Soo.

55:11.389 --> 55:12.990
I told you that\NI'll find you.

55:15.360 --> 55:17.229
That I won't die\Nbefore I find you.

55:22.970 --> 55:24.300
Lady, it's too dangerous.

55:25.300 --> 55:26.900
That's why\Nwe should do it together.

55:28.369 --> 55:29.499
Because it's dangerous.

55:30.139 --> 55:32.940
Don't you remember\Nwhat you said to me?

55:33.710 --> 55:34.780
It's too dangerous.

55:35.179 --> 55:36.349
I'll find the culprit.

55:37.349 --> 55:39.050
Why? It's too dangerous.

55:39.079 --> 55:40.749
It has\Nnothing to do with you.

55:40.749 --> 55:42.150
I feel much better\Ndoing it myself.

55:42.150 --> 55:43.490
I don't want to\Nworry about you...

55:43.820 --> 55:45.289
when you are\Nout on the field.

55:45.590 --> 55:48.190
I don't want you hurt\Nbecause of me either.

55:56.099 --> 55:57.829
How can I ever stop you?

55:58.329 --> 56:00.199
You always get\Nfooled by me.

56:01.400 --> 56:04.070
Stop it.\NDon't make that joke.

56:05.840 --> 56:06.840
We're an awful match.

56:15.479 --> 56:16.849
Why don't we go eat?

56:17.220 --> 56:18.690
I thought\Nwe were in a hurry.

56:18.820 --> 56:20.119
We're not in a hurry.

56:20.119 --> 56:22.220
Someone said\Nthey saw Secretary Kim,

56:22.659 --> 56:23.889
so I wanted to\Nhear the story.

56:23.889 --> 56:25.990
Then should I go\Nand get something simple?

56:26.630 --> 56:29.929
Right, roasted potatoes\Nwith butter are good.

56:29.929 --> 56:31.070
Should I get that?

56:31.070 --> 56:32.329
- Okay.\N- I'll go get some.

56:54.289 --> 56:55.289
What?

56:56.690 --> 56:57.760
Didn't he park here?

56:58.590 --> 56:59.659
Where did he go?

57:02.530 --> 57:04.070
Detective Ha!

57:07.740 --> 57:10.369
Lady, eat those\Npotatoes and wait.

57:10.369 --> 57:11.369
I'll be back soon.

57:31.429 --> 57:34.030
(Shooting Range)

57:45.539 --> 57:46.840
Number seven.

58:46.199 --> 58:47.240
Mr. Woo.

58:49.670 --> 58:50.769
How did you know I was...

58:50.769 --> 58:51.840
We need to go.

58:54.979 --> 58:55.979
Okay.

59:09.590 --> 59:12.789
You told me to wait here.

59:12.789 --> 59:14.329
Something urgent came up.\NI'll call you later.

59:14.960 --> 59:16.030
Detective Ha.

59:16.499 --> 59:17.499
Detective Ha.

59:17.829 --> 59:18.829
Detective...

59:23.170 --> 59:25.409
Is he telling me to\Nfind a way back home?

59:25.869 --> 59:27.579
How can I go back?

59:28.780 --> 59:29.780
By walking?

59:32.409 --> 59:33.880
Before, he wouldn't even\Nlet me take a taxi...

59:33.880 --> 59:35.220
because it's dangerous.

59:40.360 --> 59:43.630
My gosh, I have to go\Nand resolve the cases.

59:57.809 --> 59:58.809
Are you okay?

59:58.909 --> 01:00:00.139
There's a hospital nearby.

01:00:00.139 --> 01:00:01.639
Why did you come here?

01:00:02.010 --> 01:00:03.280
I was born\Nfrom a rich family,

01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:05.550
so my hobbies are golf,\Nhorseback riding and such.

01:00:06.849 --> 01:00:08.349
What about watching plays?

01:00:08.550 --> 01:00:10.650
Why were you\Nat Pierre Theater?

01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:12.720
To find Seo Hyun Soo?

01:00:14.090 --> 01:00:15.420
Then why were you...

01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:17.289
at the shooting range?\NLooking for who?

01:00:17.289 --> 01:00:19.360
Don't people go there\Nto shoot guns?

01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:20.559
I went there to shoot.

01:00:20.559 --> 01:00:21.760
Then you should've done\Njust that.

01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:22.999
Why did you get shot?

01:00:22.999 --> 01:00:24.999
You can't ask that\Nto someone who's shot.

01:00:24.999 --> 01:00:26.369
Ask the shooter.
