00:28.528 --> 00:29.768
Who's there?

00:31.131 --> 00:32.769
I know someone is out there.

00:33.333 --> 00:35.040
Show yourself coward.

00:38.304 --> 00:39.544
That looks good.

00:39.773 --> 00:41.047
I wonder who put that there?

00:42.842 --> 00:44.082
Hey where's the dog?

00:45.545 --> 00:46.580
Keep quiet.

00:48.348 --> 00:50.021
Hello my beauty.

00:54.721 --> 00:56.792
The bone works like
a charm every time.

00:59.592 --> 01:01.094
Come on. Let's get out of here.

01:02.028 --> 01:02.972
Who are those guys?

01:03.363 --> 01:06.139
Oh boy,
I'm really in the doghouse now.

02:47.734 --> 02:48.906
Mama.

02:51.070 --> 02:52.071
Huh?

02:52.972 --> 02:54.246
I heard something downstairs.

02:55.008 --> 02:58.285
- Mama.
- Columbus. It isn't Santa.

02:58.745 --> 03:00.986
Christmas is still a day away.

03:01.447 --> 03:05.054
I know! This is something else.
I sense danger.

03:07.654 --> 03:08.655
Mama.

03:12.825 --> 03:14.099
Mama.

03:14.360 --> 03:17.967
We're not watch dogs.
Nobody is robbing the house.

03:18.264 --> 03:19.299
Mama.

03:19.599 --> 03:21.010
You heard that, right?

03:21.601 --> 03:22.841
Yeah but...

03:28.007 --> 03:29.042
Mama.

03:29.576 --> 03:33.217
Do not fear young madden.
Your hero has arrived.

03:34.013 --> 03:34.991
Mama.

03:36.082 --> 03:37.117
Wait.

03:37.250 --> 03:39.093
She's trapped
in one of these packages.

03:41.120 --> 03:42.326
Mama.

03:43.957 --> 03:46.699
Mama. I want to pee.

03:47.093 --> 03:48.868
Poor thing soiled herself.

03:49.162 --> 03:51.506
Quick, before she runs out of air.

03:51.798 --> 03:54.438
Columbus, it's a doll.

03:58.004 --> 03:58.982
Huh?

04:04.110 --> 04:05.316
Mama.

04:08.147 --> 04:09.956
Bone, what did you do?

04:10.984 --> 04:12.054
Busted!

04:22.528 --> 04:24.030
Give him some love.
Give him some love.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.301
Here sit down baby. Yes!

04:27.333 --> 04:28.812
He brought down the whole tree.

04:29.035 --> 04:31.015
It was savaged!
Opened all the presents.

04:31.638 --> 04:33.015
Nope. We called this year.

04:33.773 --> 04:34.945
The nerf Bazooka?

04:35.174 --> 04:37.120
Are you kidding me?
My parents have gone mental.

04:37.243 --> 04:38.916
I would have canceled
the whole holiday.

04:39.412 --> 04:40.789
Not that it would have
mattered that much.

04:40.947 --> 04:42.517
There's barely been
any snow this year.

04:42.749 --> 04:44.057
It doesn't feel very Merry anyway.

04:44.684 --> 04:47.927
I'm telling you Hunter, this is
going to be the worst Christmas ever!

04:50.823 --> 04:51.961
Dylan, a moment?

04:52.925 --> 04:53.869
I'll catch you later.

04:55.395 --> 04:56.897
Thank you. Umm,

04:58.031 --> 05:00.102
Look. I'm sorry guys

05:00.667 --> 05:03.477
but Bone can't come with us
to Grandma's this year.

05:03.670 --> 05:04.671
She's getting too old

05:04.837 --> 05:06.942
and we can't risk Bone
knocking her down

05:07.073 --> 05:08.677
or ripping up her furniture.

05:09.475 --> 05:11.182
He's been acting wild lately.

05:16.316 --> 05:20.560
So he's going to stay at the Kennel
and that's how it's got to be.

05:20.787 --> 05:22.095
I have to put my foot down.

05:22.322 --> 05:25.098
I am the boss.
I am the head of this house hold.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.762
But Dad!

05:27.527 --> 05:30.007
But we just moved to this house,
he's gonna freak out.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.707
- Well...
- Yeah.

05:33.766 --> 05:35.905
Guys it's only a week.

05:36.202 --> 05:37.647
Bone will be fine.

05:38.371 --> 05:40.282
Those Kennels
are like prison camps.

05:40.573 --> 05:41.643
Mean brutal mutts.

05:41.841 --> 05:43.252
I hear that if a dog
enters the big house

05:43.443 --> 05:45.116
wearing a sweater
he'll get shanked.

05:46.546 --> 05:48.025
Won't he be lonely?

05:48.414 --> 05:51.020
We will be back
before he even knows we left.

05:51.317 --> 05:53.319
And Columbus will keep
the rest of us company.

05:53.986 --> 05:56.296
Okay. I guess.

05:57.123 --> 05:59.103
I hope Bone packs a sharp
chew stick.

05:59.292 --> 06:01.135
Now, we have a long drive
ahead of us,

06:01.294 --> 06:04.036
so get washed,
dressed, and pack up.

06:04.997 --> 06:06.442
And don't leave
any food out for the mice.

06:06.599 --> 06:08.135
I don't want this house destroyed.

06:08.735 --> 06:10.840
Before we have a chance
to destroy it ourselves.

06:11.270 --> 06:13.807
Oh and use
the shower downstairs please.

06:14.040 --> 06:17.249
The hot water knob is still broken.
This house has old pipes.

06:18.811 --> 06:19.915
Move it on out.

06:20.246 --> 06:21.691
The faster we get to grandma
and grandpa's,

06:21.914 --> 06:25.885
- the faster we get eggnog.
- Yay! Eggnog. Eggnog. Eggnog.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.155
What's Eggnog?

06:31.591 --> 06:34.663
I'm so sorry
that I ruined Christmas.

06:35.194 --> 06:38.698
Got a few bad dogs
and a newspaper to the nose.

06:39.031 --> 06:41.136
No biggy. I can handle it.

06:41.234 --> 06:43.475
But aren't you mad
you're not going to grandma's?

06:44.170 --> 06:46.013
Thought this was just a time out.

06:46.506 --> 06:49.646
I'm going to miss
the big turkey dinner.

06:50.443 --> 06:53.083
I'm the worst brother ever.

06:53.346 --> 06:55.053
Look, you're just new here.

06:55.148 --> 06:56.752
You don't understand our place.

06:57.283 --> 06:58.887
Don't try to be
something you're not.

06:59.085 --> 07:01.031
- A hero.
- Yeah.

07:01.287 --> 07:02.391
I know. I just thought...

07:02.989 --> 07:06.300
You see a beware of dog sign
outside this house?

07:07.160 --> 07:07.160
No.

07:08.127 --> 07:10.073
That's cause we're family pets.

07:10.363 --> 07:12.639
Our jobs are simply
to fetch the paper and...

07:12.932 --> 07:14.240
take them on brisk walks.

07:14.767 --> 07:15.745
You're right.

07:15.868 --> 07:20.248
And from this day on I promise
to never act like a watchdog again.

07:22.975 --> 07:24.045
Intruder!

07:27.079 --> 07:29.650
I got it! Guys hurry up!

07:32.051 --> 07:34.497
- Oh! Happy Holidays.
- Hi!

07:35.121 --> 07:37.123
- You must be the new owners.
- Yes.

07:37.423 --> 07:39.699
I saw you had a hold
on your mail so I, here.

07:40.092 --> 07:41.127
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:41.194 --> 07:42.400
I saw you move in the other week.

07:43.796 --> 07:46.572
I got a
pricy looking package for you.

07:46.799 --> 07:49.336
Somebody stayed of
the naughty list this year I see.

07:52.171 --> 07:54.208
Dylan! A package from uncle Rich.

08:00.680 --> 08:04.287
Socks! Uncle Rich,
you shouldn't have.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.360
Worst Christmas ever.

08:13.526 --> 08:15.904
Thank you, I wasn't sure
if I'd get here before we left.

08:16.762 --> 08:17.763
Left?

08:17.964 --> 08:21.104
Oh yes, we are going upstate
to be with family for the holidays.

08:21.634 --> 08:25.207
Fantastic! Would you like for me
to hold your mail for you?

08:25.638 --> 08:27.675
Oh, no, that won't be necessary.

08:27.974 --> 08:30.284
If you could, just leave
any packages in the back porch.

08:31.010 --> 08:32.284
You got it Mrs. C.

08:32.712 --> 08:36.659
Thanks. Oh! And this is for you.

08:36.883 --> 08:39.124
Ah, is that a tip?
I can't accept any tips.

08:42.255 --> 08:45.327
- Well it's not exactly a tip.
- No, no, no, no, gifts at all, okay.

08:45.558 --> 08:47.504
Postal Policies
seriously I can get canned.

08:48.160 --> 08:50.197
Well I won't want
to get you into trouble.

08:50.530 --> 08:51.600
Just know that your family

08:51.831 --> 08:53.833
will have a great holiday
is a reward enough.

08:56.168 --> 08:57.238
Well, thank you.

08:58.237 --> 08:59.238
Jake.

08:59.472 --> 09:03.010
Jake. Happy Holidays
to you and yours.

09:10.049 --> 09:11.357
I'm ready to go.

09:14.787 --> 09:15.891
What a weirdo.

09:16.155 --> 09:18.260
I hope the rest of this neighborhood
isn't this creepy.

09:18.824 --> 09:20.201
That's cause he's a postman.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.562
No. It's something else.

09:22.895 --> 09:24.897
There's something fishy about him.

09:25.064 --> 09:28.409
True. He reeks of fish
and body spray.

09:28.534 --> 09:31.140
It's disgusting.
I could smell him from here.

09:31.637 --> 09:33.241
I'll keep an eye on him.

09:33.673 --> 09:35.414
Stop with the macho yapping.

09:35.675 --> 09:38.815
Jake is nothing more than
a smelly harmless creep.

09:51.190 --> 09:52.533
How's everything going back here?

09:53.492 --> 09:54.562
Sweet as sugar.

09:55.094 --> 09:56.505
$20 from aunt June.

09:56.963 --> 09:59.910
And for Billy a stick of gum
to do something special with.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.806
Score! A gift certificate
for Chuckle Cheese.

10:03.903 --> 10:05.177
We have out Christmas Eve dinner.

10:05.871 --> 10:07.782
Nah, we're cleaning out
the new house tonight.

10:08.274 --> 10:10.481
Oh, I thought we'd go Caroling?

10:20.152 --> 10:21.722
Kid with a bike at 2 o'clock.

10:36.936 --> 10:37.937
Hey!

10:46.078 --> 10:47.216
I think I saw this place

10:47.480 --> 10:49.653
on that police show you
and mom like to watch.

10:51.183 --> 10:53.322
We're there now.
Pretty high security.

10:54.153 --> 10:55.826
Didn't see any sniper towers.

10:56.155 --> 10:58.362
More of a white dog collar person.

10:58.824 --> 11:01.532
But Daddy does he have to go?

11:02.161 --> 11:03.834
Yeah. Well...

11:04.930 --> 11:05.965
Mommy, what do you think?

11:08.134 --> 11:09.204
I love Bone,

11:09.769 --> 11:12.045
just as much as you do
but he was bad.

11:12.605 --> 11:14.744
You won't like it if Dylan opened up
all your presents.

11:15.007 --> 11:17.078
Right. Like a care about
little Miss wet myself.

11:18.644 --> 11:20.715
Now give him
one last hug goodbye.

11:21.013 --> 11:22.219
We need to get on the road.

11:22.615 --> 11:23.719
Be good Bone.

11:24.984 --> 11:26.054
See ya Bud.

11:32.925 --> 11:34.563
- Alright buddy.
- Be careful in there.

11:34.994 --> 11:35.972
Come on Bone.

11:36.328 --> 11:38.103
- Merry Christmas Dude.
- Come on, here we go.

11:38.264 --> 11:41.711
- Come on boy.
- That goes double for you Columbus.

11:46.972 --> 11:49.179
Huh, I know
it doesn't look like much but,

11:50.042 --> 11:52.044
well we'll see. Alright buddy.

11:54.113 --> 11:55.183
Hello?

11:57.249 --> 11:58.159
Hello?

11:59.852 --> 12:01.126
Save yourselves.

12:03.122 --> 12:04.465
No tag. You're it.

12:06.025 --> 12:07.060
Oh!

12:09.161 --> 12:09.969
Dog poop.

12:13.165 --> 12:14.143
You're going to clean that up?

12:14.867 --> 12:17.211
No, I'm covered in dog poop.

12:18.404 --> 12:20.748
Hey how you doing?
I'm Anthony Anthony.

12:21.507 --> 12:24.044
But my friends call me, Triple A.

12:25.644 --> 12:26.679
I'm good.

12:27.446 --> 12:28.481
What's the other A for?

12:29.148 --> 12:30.218
Other A?

12:30.483 --> 12:32.121
Well you said, Triple A.

12:32.752 --> 12:35.289
Oh, yeah! I can see
why that's confusing. Yeah.

12:35.721 --> 12:37.496
So, who's the little guy?

12:37.923 --> 12:39.334
Oh. Bone.

12:40.926 --> 12:42.269
My wife's name was Bone.

12:43.329 --> 12:45.240
- Really?
- I'm just kidding with you.

12:46.065 --> 12:47.738
You know what,
it's too hot outside.

12:48.134 --> 12:49.112
Why don't we go inside?

12:52.037 --> 12:52.981
Come on Bone.

12:55.040 --> 12:57.486
Come on in.
Watch yourself, watch these guys.

12:58.544 --> 12:59.488
Come here.

13:03.048 --> 13:04.755
So, how long are you in for Bone?

13:04.984 --> 13:09.023
Just a couple of days.
I had called earlier but...

13:09.088 --> 13:10.590
you seem really busy so.

13:10.823 --> 13:12.393
No. This isn't busy.

13:12.525 --> 13:14.869
Sometimes I have 5 times
the amount of animals in here.

13:15.161 --> 13:16.333
5 times? But...

13:16.629 --> 13:18.165
Sir, I can see you're hesitating.

13:18.564 --> 13:20.976
I'll tell you what I'm a do,
I'm gonna give you $10 dollars off.

13:21.634 --> 13:24.080
- Oh, it's not that.
- $30 dollars.

13:24.403 --> 13:25.973
You seem like a nice guy.

13:26.105 --> 13:27.243
$6 dollars?

13:27.773 --> 13:29.081
I... Wait?

13:29.975 --> 13:31.010
$6 dollars?

13:31.477 --> 13:32.455
I'm bad at this Sir.

13:32.645 --> 13:35.216
Look you seem a little overwhelmed,
so Come one Bone.

13:36.715 --> 13:38.626
Look Sir, I need this okay.

13:38.884 --> 13:41.626
I love dogs. I love dogs
more than I love people.

13:52.531 --> 13:54.533
I understand times
are tough but...

13:56.035 --> 13:57.173
Bone is family.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.407
And he's like my family too man.

14:00.172 --> 14:01.981
I'm gonna treat him
like I treat my little brother.

14:02.107 --> 14:04.485
And I love my little brother.

14:05.945 --> 14:06.980
Most of the time.

14:07.446 --> 14:09.483
But Sir look, I love these guys.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.525
I play with them all the time.
We don't go hungry.

14:11.984 --> 14:12.928
We just have fun and play.

14:13.152 --> 14:14.324
I treat them
like they're all in my house.

14:14.520 --> 14:15.965
I'm not throwing them
in some cage

14:16.188 --> 14:17.724
and some boarding house
somewhere.

14:17.890 --> 14:19.665
I know this doesn't look like your

14:19.792 --> 14:22.534
fancy dog spa
with the fancy dog food.

14:22.828 --> 14:24.102
And the massages.

14:24.463 --> 14:25.441
Huh?

14:25.664 --> 14:26.608
Massages?

14:27.399 --> 14:29.379
Sir, I have been doing this
for 23 years.

14:29.802 --> 14:33.807
15 weeks.
About 9 hours. 15 minutes.

14:34.173 --> 14:35.811
Oh, and I forgot to tell you.

14:36.909 --> 14:37.979
I'm on TV.

14:38.210 --> 14:40.486
- You have a TV show?
- Yes I do.

14:40.713 --> 14:43.694
Well, I kinda, I have a show.
Well no not really.

14:44.116 --> 14:47.325
See it's on a TV show
but it's a TV show. There.

14:49.455 --> 14:51.958
- Oh! A surveillance camera.
- Yes!

14:52.157 --> 14:56.401
And you can take that and
plug it into the worldwide Internet.

14:56.695 --> 14:59.369
You know. Contraption.
In fact my little cousin,

14:59.665 --> 15:01.144
I thought he kept sending me
all these free movies

15:01.333 --> 15:02.812
Turns out that I'm in them.

15:04.003 --> 15:06.040
Hi mom. Whoa! I'm on TV.

15:08.107 --> 15:09.745
You know um... I don't know.

15:10.609 --> 15:12.611
Sir please, it's Christmas.

15:13.112 --> 15:15.854
I will take very good care of Steve.

15:16.882 --> 15:17.883
Bone.

15:18.717 --> 15:19.821
Really?

15:20.119 --> 15:21.496
He looks like a Steve.

15:22.087 --> 15:24.089
Look Sir, I don't have children.

15:24.323 --> 15:24.323
But these guys
are like my children.

15:26.125 --> 15:27.763
All of them. I love them all.

15:28.093 --> 15:29.094
The fat ones.

15:29.528 --> 15:31.974
The skinny ones.
The little ones.

15:32.431 --> 15:34.104
I'll take really good care
of your dog, I promise.

15:37.369 --> 15:39.246
Yeah boy. Come here.

15:39.905 --> 15:41.441
What do you...
What do you think?

15:44.310 --> 15:45.482
Alright good.

15:47.646 --> 15:48.590
Okay.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.052
- Really?
- Really.

15:50.349 --> 15:51.953
But I get to watch Bone on TV.

15:52.384 --> 15:55.228
Every channel,
364 hours a day.

15:56.055 --> 15:57.125
Don't you mean a year?

15:57.690 --> 15:57.690
No he's not gonna be here
that long.

15:59.091 --> 16:00.502
Unless you want him to be
and then...

16:00.726 --> 16:02.262
I can cut you a really good deal sir.

16:03.529 --> 16:04.906
No, that's okay.

16:04.997 --> 16:07.944
Well, great! And Merry Christmas.

16:08.067 --> 16:09.239
Ah, you too.

16:12.671 --> 16:14.582
- Alright buddy.
- Come on buddy. Come on.

16:14.807 --> 16:16.377
Come on. Let's go.
Come on, let's go.

16:17.676 --> 16:18.586
Okay.

16:29.154 --> 16:31.065
Oh! It is freezing out there!

16:32.024 --> 16:33.128
Let's get a little heat on.

16:35.361 --> 16:36.396
How'd he take it?

16:36.829 --> 16:38.900
Uh, he took it like a champ.

16:39.531 --> 16:41.511
The own is... well he...

16:42.568 --> 16:43.546
He likes dogs.

16:44.703 --> 16:45.841
You think he'll be okay?

16:46.438 --> 16:48.418
I hate to think of him
in a cold kennel.

16:48.807 --> 16:51.447
Sharing a water bowl
with 10 other lonely mutts.

16:51.910 --> 16:54.789
I'm telling you.
It's not that bad.

16:55.748 --> 16:56.988
Alright guys buckle up.

16:58.250 --> 16:59.251
Okay.

17:00.252 --> 17:01.492
Here we go.

17:02.788 --> 17:03.960
It's gonna be fun.

17:05.991 --> 17:08.096
I'm so sorry Bone.

17:08.292 --> 17:10.204
I'll see you after Christmas.

17:12.196 --> 17:13.436
Alright. Come on.

17:14.532 --> 17:16.137
That's it. Right in here.

17:17.069 --> 17:20.346
Okay. Go ahead and find
a mattress you can call your own.

17:21.406 --> 17:21.406
And the doggie door
is in the back, okay?

17:23.175 --> 17:26.054
Just feel free
to hang out and chill, okay.

17:26.444 --> 17:28.686
I'll be in the living room
watching Clash of the Empires,

17:28.847 --> 17:31.054
if you want to come out there
and veg out or something.

17:31.750 --> 17:32.854
Alright Steve.

17:35.988 --> 17:36.966
Hi I'm...

17:38.957 --> 17:41.130
- What did I...
- He's a little spooked man.

17:41.493 --> 17:43.871
From me?
I don't scare anyone.

17:44.129 --> 17:45.301
Neither does he.

17:46.799 --> 17:48.244
Hey look, I'm sorry.

17:48.534 --> 17:50.605
- Go away!
- Sure but...

17:50.803 --> 17:51.975
Go away!

17:52.638 --> 17:54.845
Come on. Let's leave him alone.

17:59.478 --> 18:01.082
Did you unplug
all the appliances?

18:01.280 --> 18:03.385
- Yeah.
- And the lights are on timers?

18:04.049 --> 18:05.027
Taken care of.

18:05.184 --> 18:07.130
And all the doors
and windows are locked?

18:08.053 --> 18:09.088
Yes, dear.

18:09.888 --> 18:11.595
Did you lock
your bedroom window Dylan?

18:11.990 --> 18:13.128
Gosh I hope so.

18:13.358 --> 18:15.497
I pray that someone doesn't
steal my awesome new socks.

18:17.129 --> 18:19.541
Hey, how about we stop
for a little hot chocolate?

18:20.032 --> 18:21.010
Huh?

18:22.067 --> 18:23.740
We're only 4 hours
from your parents' house.

18:23.969 --> 18:25.971
Let's not spoil the kids' appetites.

18:26.371 --> 18:30.012
Yeah, I can't wait for a big bowl
of grandma's left over Mac and cheese.

18:31.743 --> 18:32.881
You know what? He's right.

18:33.145 --> 18:35.091
She only makes a fuss
over Christmas Day dinner.

18:35.814 --> 18:36.849
Yeah.

18:37.916 --> 18:39.623
- Is this fun?
- Yeah.

18:49.328 --> 18:50.534
Hey how about this place?

18:51.163 --> 18:52.904
We'll be back on the road
before you know it.

18:52.998 --> 18:58.414
Alright. Even I can use a break
from grandma's stale Mac and Cheese.

19:01.106 --> 19:02.346
I miss Bone.

19:02.674 --> 19:03.982
Oh sweetie.

19:04.276 --> 19:07.519
Let's not start that again.
You'll see him in 6 days okay?

19:08.247 --> 19:09.225
Why not now?

19:10.082 --> 19:11.459
Dylan hand me your tablet.

19:11.717 --> 19:14.129
There's no app
for fix my lousy Christmas.

19:14.286 --> 19:15.424
I checked.

19:21.560 --> 19:22.664
Bone!

19:25.764 --> 19:27.004
Look at that!

19:27.399 --> 19:29.003
Bone is holding court.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.409
He looks happy too.

19:34.606 --> 19:36.017
Told you he's make friends.

19:36.675 --> 19:37.813
He does look happy.

19:38.010 --> 19:39.921
I wish he could see us too.

19:41.013 --> 19:42.321
So what happened?

19:42.881 --> 19:44.292
Happened man?

19:44.883 --> 19:46.692
- To him.
- Oh, Cupcake.

19:46.985 --> 19:49.465
Oh man. That's a messed up story.

19:50.055 --> 19:51.261
He seems angry.

19:51.823 --> 19:54.269
He should be. He lost his bite.

19:55.194 --> 19:56.298
His bite?

19:57.129 --> 19:58.699
He's a watch dog man.

19:58.964 --> 20:00.739
And all he did was watch.

20:01.133 --> 20:03.409
One part watch. No part dog.

20:03.735 --> 20:06.648
The robbers came into the house,
took everything. Then left.

20:07.806 --> 20:09.547
And he didn't do anything?

20:10.275 --> 20:13.722
Nope just watched.
See, watch dog.

20:14.079 --> 20:17.652
Not action dog.
Not stop the thieves' dog.

20:18.717 --> 20:20.458
No everyone can fight.

20:21.153 --> 20:23.497
I know.
But he doesn't know that.

20:23.889 --> 20:25.766
I know what I know.

20:26.825 --> 20:29.669
Oh hey! Cupcake!
I didn't notice you there.

20:30.128 --> 20:32.130
I let the intruders
get into the house.

20:33.765 --> 20:35.506
I lost my bite.

20:36.368 --> 20:38.541
I don't have a bite.

20:39.037 --> 20:40.380
We all have a bite.

20:41.240 --> 20:44.153
Some of us
just don't know it yet.

20:44.876 --> 20:46.321
So what happened?

20:47.279 --> 20:49.054
I ruined Christmas for my family.

20:49.848 --> 20:53.421
As punishment, I got sent
to this hippie commune doggie jail.

20:53.852 --> 20:56.332
While they went up
to the mountains to play in the snow.

20:56.688 --> 20:59.362
Hey man!
Don't be so hard on yourself.

20:59.758 --> 21:02.364
I heard there were like
200 robbers with big guns,

21:02.728 --> 21:04.537
and a rocket, and magic spells!

21:05.130 --> 21:08.976
It was 3 idiot robbers that smelled
like fish and body spray.

21:09.368 --> 21:11.041
Fish? Body spray?

21:11.703 --> 21:13.478
Yeah. Why?

21:14.006 --> 21:15.781
Where do you live?

21:16.575 --> 21:18.680
Off oak park. Why?

21:19.144 --> 21:20.088
That's my street.

21:20.479 --> 21:22.288
I know some one
that smells like fish.

21:22.914 --> 21:25.019
Could be the same guy.

21:25.250 --> 21:27.059
Of course it's the same guy.

21:27.919 --> 21:28.920
How do you know him?

21:29.554 --> 21:32.125
He was at the house today.
Before we left.

21:34.192 --> 21:35.967
He was casing the joint.

21:36.428 --> 21:37.566
Casing the joint?

21:38.030 --> 21:40.567
Yeah. He's going to do
the same thing to your family,

21:40.766 --> 21:42.370
like he did to my family.

21:42.868 --> 21:44.176
You're going to get robbed.

21:44.636 --> 21:48.550
And then you are going to stay here
for the rest of your life.

21:49.374 --> 21:51.650
I think there's a 2 week limit man.

21:53.145 --> 21:56.058
You have to go there.
You have to stop them.

21:56.748 --> 21:59.820
Stop them? How?
I can't call 911.

22:00.052 --> 22:01.827
This room
doesn't even have a phone.

22:01.987 --> 22:04.126
And we don't have thumbs.

22:08.327 --> 22:09.897
What's gotten into Columbus?

22:10.829 --> 22:13.105
He acts like understands Bone,

22:13.198 --> 22:16.111
He does. He hears him saying
"My family abandoned me".

22:16.234 --> 22:17.645
Hey it's not that.

22:17.836 --> 22:20.817
Look, he's made new friends
to celebrate Christmas with.

22:21.006 --> 22:23.782
Okay. We'll be back
in 10 minutes.

22:25.911 --> 22:26.912
Okay.

22:27.846 --> 22:28.847
Let's go troops.

22:31.450 --> 22:34.920
Our home is in danger,
and Bone needs my help.

22:37.589 --> 22:38.897
What's the plan here again?

22:39.224 --> 22:41.101
We're hiding from the warden.

22:41.326 --> 22:42.464
Who? Triple A?

22:42.728 --> 22:44.207
He's gonna know
we're under here.

22:45.130 --> 22:47.838
Under these blankets
we're completely invisible.

22:48.233 --> 22:49.576
It's common knowledge.

22:57.809 --> 22:59.584
Well he's gonna know
we're under here now.

23:00.011 --> 23:01.046
No necessarily.

23:01.546 --> 23:04.026
Human also have
a terrible sense of smell.

23:04.483 --> 23:06.463
Oh! Not this bad.

23:07.586 --> 23:08.963
My eyes are watering.

23:09.654 --> 23:12.965
For the first time,
I can see color.

23:14.192 --> 23:15.364
Don't worry about it.

23:15.994 --> 23:17.996
Hey strange dog, you ready?

23:18.130 --> 23:21.805
This is our big chance.
I'll make it count.

23:39.951 --> 23:42.864
I'm so happy. I'm so happy.

23:42.988 --> 23:47.095
No. I'm doing the pee dance.
Skippidy do.

23:50.095 --> 23:51.540
Nailed it man.

23:51.963 --> 23:54.102
- Nailed it.
- You gotta go out little guy?

23:55.634 --> 23:57.511
Alright come on.
We'll go relieve ourselves together.

23:57.803 --> 23:59.077
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

23:59.271 --> 24:02.445
TMI dude. TMI.

24:03.175 --> 24:04.153
Now!

24:04.443 --> 24:06.047
You cannot contain us man.

24:06.244 --> 24:07.723
I am invisible!

24:08.914 --> 24:10.894
You're one messed up little doggie.
You know that?

24:11.149 --> 24:12.719
Get over here.
I got you. Come on.

24:15.587 --> 24:17.123
Keep it low. Quite.

24:17.289 --> 24:19.565
- My belly is getting scratchy.
- Ready?

24:20.158 --> 24:23.696
- Go!
- I'm tired. Run Bone. Run!

24:24.429 --> 24:26.102
Find your bite.

24:50.589 --> 24:52.967
Hey man,
you gotta help me get out.

24:53.358 --> 24:54.598
My brother is in trouble.

25:00.398 --> 25:02.036
Think puppy think. Hmm.

25:02.934 --> 25:04.538
Parking brake. Hmm.

25:15.213 --> 25:17.659
All I'm saying is that
I believe that Rudolf's nose glowed

25:17.916 --> 25:19.953
because he was raised
by a nuclear power plant.

25:20.485 --> 25:21.964
What about prancer and blitzen?

25:22.687 --> 25:24.860
Comet? Cupid?
All of them grew up there.

25:24.990 --> 25:26.162
That's why they can fly.

25:29.594 --> 25:30.664
Nearly there.

25:31.730 --> 25:32.800
Got it.

25:34.799 --> 25:36.107
Oh dear.

25:40.105 --> 25:42.415
Excuse me, you folks driving
the dark blue SUV?

25:42.774 --> 25:43.684
Yeah, why?

25:44.409 --> 25:46.184
Well it's driving itself
around back.

25:51.783 --> 25:52.887
I'm free!

25:53.552 --> 25:54.622
Oh no!

26:02.160 --> 26:05.107
Okay. The bumper is scratched.
The window broken but we're fine.

26:05.630 --> 26:07.041
Dad, you better check the policy.

26:07.399 --> 26:09.743
The puppy might not be insured
as an additional driver.

26:10.068 --> 26:11.376
Where is Columbus?

26:14.439 --> 26:15.645
There he is?

26:20.445 --> 26:22.049
This better work.

26:30.956 --> 26:32.060
What's the battle plan boss?

26:32.223 --> 26:35.534
Same as always.
Look for small items.

26:36.094 --> 26:37.334
Easy to carry.

26:38.363 --> 26:41.139
Jewelry. Antiques.
Gifts that haven't been opened yet

26:41.199 --> 26:42.701
that can be returned for cash.

26:44.135 --> 26:45.671
If anybody sees
an easy make oven.

26:46.071 --> 26:46.981
No.

26:47.505 --> 26:49.075
They make little
delicious chocolate cake.

26:49.307 --> 26:51.287
- No.
- I do all the cooking.

26:51.476 --> 26:52.978
No, easy bake oven!

26:55.680 --> 26:56.818
Gotta get faster.

26:57.649 --> 26:58.957
Hey! Hey! Whoa!

26:59.751 --> 27:01.492
Commandeering this.
Thank you.

27:05.190 --> 27:07.101
Hey! Dylan is right.

27:07.525 --> 27:09.562
This is the worst Christmas ever.

27:10.128 --> 27:11.505
Still want TVs? Laptops?

27:13.064 --> 27:14.407
Electronics are okay.

27:15.266 --> 27:17.337
- Sweet.
- Technically the easy bake oven

27:17.602 --> 27:19.138
is powered electronically
by a light bulb.

27:28.813 --> 27:30.850
I don't recognize this van.

27:33.718 --> 27:35.720
It smells like fish
and body spray.

27:36.054 --> 27:37.032
Jake.

27:38.757 --> 27:40.668
Most of the police force
is off duty celebrating

27:40.925 --> 27:41.960
with their families and such.

27:42.560 --> 27:44.972
As long as we don't make
a racket...

27:46.598 --> 27:47.838
we should have all day.

27:50.268 --> 27:51.406
How's it look?

28:05.316 --> 28:06.317
We're clear.

28:07.986 --> 28:09.056
Let's do it.

28:19.064 --> 28:20.407
Come on. Come on.

28:34.546 --> 28:36.890
Back! Go, go, go, go!

28:49.394 --> 28:50.737
Why did those go off?

28:50.962 --> 28:52.703
Let's just split
and come back later.

28:52.831 --> 28:54.310
They're gonna be gone
for a whole week.

28:54.599 --> 28:56.772
How about we do something fun
like go Caroling.

28:56.835 --> 28:59.975
Today is optimal.
We hold on and wait out the alarms.

29:01.573 --> 29:02.574
I stopped them.

29:02.807 --> 29:05.083
But why isn't anybody
coming out of the houses?

29:07.245 --> 29:09.191
They must be on vacation too.

29:11.082 --> 29:12.425
I've got to stop them.

29:22.927 --> 29:24.565
Bet they'll fall for this.

29:40.311 --> 29:42.382
This will help them stick around.

29:49.888 --> 29:51.868
This will be a wash out.

30:02.200 --> 30:05.010
I'm gonna get into
so much trouble for this.

30:16.014 --> 30:18.119
Let's heat thing up a little.

30:33.798 --> 30:35.641
Hope this sticks with them.

30:39.604 --> 30:42.084
Can't wait to see
who steps on these.

30:52.517 --> 30:54.622
Hot sauce facial wash.

30:57.488 --> 30:59.399
Hopes this raises their pulses.

31:04.529 --> 31:06.008
I think that was the last car alarm.

31:06.264 --> 31:07.334
Good.

31:08.399 --> 31:09.605
Games a foot.

31:10.168 --> 31:13.012
Remember, play it smart.

31:13.671 --> 31:14.649
Right.

31:16.441 --> 31:17.385
Play what smart?

32:07.091 --> 32:08.195
What game are we playing smart?

32:09.193 --> 32:10.729
Seriously, I don't know the rules.

32:11.429 --> 32:12.373
Who goes first.

32:15.667 --> 32:16.771
Can I be the thimble?

32:18.069 --> 32:19.207
Shut it up.

32:32.150 --> 32:36.621
Now Rob, don't break any windows.
I'm not 100% sure about alarms.

32:36.988 --> 32:39.127
Dude I'm a professional.

32:39.691 --> 32:40.931
I think I know...

32:52.403 --> 32:55.543
Stop! Stop! I'm stuck.

32:57.508 --> 32:59.988
- Get me off from the bottom.
- Sure. Gotcha!

33:10.054 --> 33:11.124
Should we push or pull?

33:11.990 --> 33:13.196
What are you waiting for?

33:13.524 --> 33:14.730
Just hold on.

33:22.033 --> 33:23.535
What? We didn't even touch you.

33:24.202 --> 33:25.237
Who was that?

33:26.270 --> 33:28.477
Something hit me in the head.

33:30.074 --> 33:32.520
- I don't see nothing.
- It hit me hard.

33:32.810 --> 33:34.448
Okay. We'll get you out
really quick like.

33:37.749 --> 33:38.887
Who's doing that?

33:43.054 --> 33:46.092
1, 2, 3.

34:00.171 --> 34:02.378
Stop! Stop! Stop!

34:04.375 --> 34:05.911
What is happening?

34:18.989 --> 34:22.130
Slipper soap for slipper folk.

34:29.567 --> 34:31.137
I think I need to sit down.

34:36.074 --> 34:37.348
Up there.

34:38.109 --> 34:39.246
An open window.

34:41.813 --> 34:43.018
There's a ladder.

35:38.836 --> 35:40.042
Enough fooling around.

35:56.721 --> 35:58.132
How you doing Diesel?

35:59.157 --> 36:01.159
Who's this little one?

36:03.594 --> 36:06.404
It can't be... Santa?

36:08.766 --> 36:11.178
72 East Oak Park huh?

36:11.636 --> 36:14.139
You're a long way from home.

36:14.272 --> 36:15.774
Nick, what are you doing
back there?

36:16.107 --> 36:19.577
- Looks like Diesel's got a friend.
- A friend?

36:21.312 --> 36:23.622
Let's get you home
before Christmas little one.

36:29.120 --> 36:30.963
We need to take
a little road trip mother.

36:31.122 --> 36:33.864
Well Nicholas we need to be home,
remember the kids.

36:34.125 --> 36:35.502
Oh, they'll be alright.

36:36.160 --> 36:39.141
This little one in the back
needs to be with family.

36:47.605 --> 36:49.812
- Who are you?
- I'm Columbus.

36:50.007 --> 36:51.145
Why are you here?

36:51.642 --> 36:54.088
I'm trying to save Christmas
and my big brother.

36:54.345 --> 36:55.653
Save Christmas?

36:56.113 --> 36:57.387
That's adorable.

36:57.682 --> 36:58.752
Where you going?

36:59.116 --> 37:01.926
I'm just trying to help my brother
stop some fishy criminals

37:02.086 --> 37:03.565
from robbing my family's house.

37:03.988 --> 37:05.023
Watch dog, huh?

37:05.590 --> 37:08.537
I've done security work.
Salvage yard.

37:09.126 --> 37:12.972
Nothing like sinking your K-9s
into an intruder's arm.

37:13.364 --> 37:17.244
Ripping it out of it's socket,
and, and going for the jugular.

37:17.635 --> 37:19.410
Now that's worth living for.

37:20.271 --> 37:22.979
Uh... That's true.

37:24.675 --> 37:26.586
Hey! Stop!

37:26.911 --> 37:28.413
You have our dog!

37:29.046 --> 37:30.650
They can't hears us! Hey!

37:31.849 --> 37:33.089
Stop!

37:33.751 --> 37:34.957
We're bring chased.

37:35.086 --> 37:37.862
If they catch up to us
I won't be able to help Bone.

37:38.522 --> 37:39.796
I got this.

37:47.331 --> 37:50.540
A really big dog threw a 2x4 at us
and we're spinning out of control.

37:50.868 --> 37:52.575
Worst Christmas ever!

37:58.242 --> 38:02.054
- No!
- What is it?

38:03.047 --> 38:04.185
My battery is dead.

38:08.052 --> 38:09.554
Go around to the side door.

38:10.121 --> 38:11.725
At least you won't hurt
yourselves there.

39:43.481 --> 39:44.824
One bungee cord.

39:46.917 --> 39:49.727
One garage door.

39:53.958 --> 39:54.959
And...

39:56.527 --> 39:58.165
One reindeer antler.

40:15.546 --> 40:16.581
Alright.

40:19.083 --> 40:20.153
Get to work.

40:45.709 --> 40:50.658
He's a mean one Mr. Jake.

41:03.694 --> 41:05.264
Sweet. Bean dip.

41:07.798 --> 41:08.742
I shouldn't.

41:25.015 --> 41:26.653
Hey who want tiramisu?

41:29.153 --> 41:30.632
Don't touch that it's hot.

41:34.358 --> 41:35.735
Thanks for the heads up.

41:38.996 --> 41:40.202
You okay buddy?

41:40.865 --> 41:41.900
Wake up.

41:43.033 --> 41:45.411
Robbing this house
is ruining my Christmas.

41:45.803 --> 41:47.680
And so are these mouse traps.

41:48.906 --> 41:50.078
Oh, god.

41:51.242 --> 41:53.119
This is ridiculous.

42:05.155 --> 42:06.259
Where did that that dog
come from?

42:06.957 --> 42:07.992
Why does he have a rope?

42:11.962 --> 42:13.032
Don't move.

42:13.464 --> 42:17.139
God boy. Who's a good boy?

42:19.036 --> 42:20.811
Okay. Okay.

42:21.205 --> 42:23.776
Don't be angry.
We're all friends here.

42:24.208 --> 42:25.278
We're going to have to make
a break for it.

42:25.676 --> 42:27.519
- Well, what about Rob?
- Collateral damage.

42:28.012 --> 42:29.013
He won't be missed.

42:29.146 --> 42:30.454
You gotta wake up buddy.

42:36.353 --> 42:38.094
Hey, it's a doggy.

42:42.092 --> 42:43.366
Oh, nuts!

42:45.229 --> 42:46.299
Here we go.

42:47.665 --> 42:51.374
1, 2...

42:59.743 --> 43:00.653
Who could that be?

43:01.078 --> 43:03.080
Just ignore them.
Let's pretend we're not home.

43:03.514 --> 43:05.960
I think they know
somebody's home already.

43:11.488 --> 43:12.694
Carolers.

43:14.692 --> 43:21.439
"Hark the angels sing.
Glory to the new born king."

43:21.832 --> 43:25.006
"Peace on earth
and mercy mild."

43:25.235 --> 43:28.341
"God and sin is reconciled."

43:28.672 --> 43:37.592
"Joyful all ye nations rise.
Joyful all ye nations rise."

43:43.153 --> 43:45.292
Where'd the dog go?
He nearly killed us.

43:47.391 --> 43:48.734
- Who you calling?
- My cousin.

43:48.926 --> 43:51.133
My family's other civil servant.

43:52.029 --> 43:53.030
Wait. Quinten?

43:53.464 --> 43:56.638
- That psycho?
- Oh man. That dude is bad news.

43:56.867 --> 43:59.347
He's effective and an expert
at this kind of thing.

44:13.384 --> 44:15.295
Hello. I'm looking
for Cindy McEntire.

44:16.253 --> 44:17.323
Oh, hello Cindy.

44:17.721 --> 44:19.962
I have a lead on
the were about of your dog.

44:22.726 --> 44:23.966
- Sush you.
- Oh no.

44:24.995 --> 44:26.497
I understand there is a reward.

44:29.233 --> 44:30.337
I wanna go home.

44:30.868 --> 44:32.541
Yeah, I don't want that.

44:32.770 --> 44:36.809
Here is what's gonna take to pecure
my services to find your Bubbles.

44:37.608 --> 44:41.112
One case of diet Apricot Snapple.
If it isn't diet no dog.

44:41.311 --> 44:43.052
$200 dollars a day
whether I find him or not.

44:43.113 --> 44:44.615
Lunch when I finished the job.

44:44.848 --> 44:47.454
And I like the crust
cut off my sandwiches.

44:48.185 --> 44:49.630
Yeah it's not a deal breaker

44:50.187 --> 44:53.100
but it is in your best interest
that there be no crust.

44:53.157 --> 44:56.764
Also you got to get mayor
to get off my back, and...

44:57.161 --> 44:58.367
chance the zoning
in front of my duplex

44:58.595 --> 45:00.199
because I'm getting way
too many parking tickets...

45:02.166 --> 45:03.975
What, what do you mean
you don't know the mayor?

45:05.335 --> 45:06.211
Hang on.

45:07.037 --> 45:08.607
Happy time pet
finders how may I help...

45:13.477 --> 45:15.218
Stay put. Don't do anything
I'll be right there.

45:16.046 --> 45:19.027
Cindy it's simple. No Mayor...

45:20.851 --> 45:21.852
No Bubbles.

45:34.965 --> 45:35.966
Come on.

45:37.167 --> 45:38.145
Give.

45:38.535 --> 45:40.481
I thought it was righty
tighty lefty loosy?

45:42.106 --> 45:44.985
Yeah, well, most of the time it is.

45:46.043 --> 45:50.014
But sometimes
it's righty offy lefty ony.

45:51.882 --> 45:55.921
Hey we're having a father son
manly moment huh!

45:57.121 --> 45:58.122
What do you think?

45:58.522 --> 45:59.967
I can't wait to enter it in my diary.

46:00.090 --> 46:01.933
How I spent
my Christmas vacation.

46:02.159 --> 46:03.103
Dad showed me
how to strip lug nuts

46:03.293 --> 46:05.136
and we both shared sickness.

46:05.829 --> 46:08.742
Geepers! Worst Christmas ever.

46:08.999 --> 46:10.034
Alright that's enough.

46:10.868 --> 46:14.213
I'm trying. I would appreciate
a little effort from you.

46:14.905 --> 46:17.647
- Dad, I think...
- I know what you think.

46:18.375 --> 46:20.787
This trip is horrible
and that you're miserable.

46:20.911 --> 46:22.254
And it's a disappointment.

46:22.846 --> 46:25.827
I... Just because
you are unhappy doesn't mean

46:26.049 --> 46:27.960
that you have to make
everyone one else unhappy.

46:28.552 --> 46:30.930
- Dad, look.
- No you look.

46:31.755 --> 46:35.168
This holiday season
is about sharing and caring,

46:35.392 --> 46:36.996
and about being jolly.

46:37.427 --> 46:40.101
You think you could be jolly,
just for one day.

46:40.464 --> 46:43.035
- Dad.
- Hey, let me finish alright?

46:43.433 --> 46:45.140
Christmas is about
your little sister.

46:45.402 --> 46:49.077
She still believes in the magic.
Don't ruin that for her.

46:50.174 --> 46:53.087
You gotta focus on the big things
not the little things.

46:54.812 --> 46:55.916
Now what did you want to say?

46:57.080 --> 46:59.151
Is the spare tire a little thing
or a big thing?

47:01.752 --> 47:03.959
The spare tire is a little thing.
But it's a big...

47:05.823 --> 47:07.461
Oh! Hey!

47:08.725 --> 47:10.796
That's my tire!

47:14.031 --> 47:15.135
It doesn't make sense.

47:15.532 --> 47:17.443
Why would a family leave
their dog here a whole week.

47:18.168 --> 47:19.044
Maybe it's not their dog?

47:19.436 --> 47:21.575
Maybe it's a stray that wondered
in through the doggie door.

47:22.039 --> 47:24.178
I knew the Connelly's had
a little yapping puppy but...

47:25.175 --> 47:28.213
could be they have another dog
the quiet one that keeps to himself.

47:55.906 --> 47:57.010
You'll know me.

47:59.109 --> 48:00.713
You know what I do for a living.

48:03.013 --> 48:06.551
I'm not gonna do it for a measly
$50 dollars this time.

48:09.186 --> 48:10.529
I want $60.

48:13.023 --> 48:14.593
The rest of that bean burrito.

48:16.293 --> 48:17.601
It's a chimichanga.

48:24.201 --> 48:25.202
Deal.

48:34.411 --> 48:36.823
So cuz, I'm not sure
what kind of breed this is.

48:37.915 --> 48:40.521
It shouldn't be much of a problem.
I don't think he bites.

48:40.918 --> 48:42.864
They all have a bite.

48:44.121 --> 48:45.998
I've been doing this for years.

48:46.390 --> 48:49.064
I've seen every kind
of Canis Lupus Familiaris.

48:51.194 --> 48:52.696
You see that there chief?

48:53.797 --> 48:55.140
3 stiches from a Great Dane.

48:55.532 --> 48:57.102
Who didn't care to be put down.

48:58.368 --> 48:59.642
This bite mark here.

49:00.704 --> 49:03.446
Courtesy of a chihuahua.
Angry little cus name pepi.

49:03.840 --> 49:05.877
Came into inches of cutting
into a vital artery.

49:06.743 --> 49:08.518
Suppose you get a lot of scars
in your business.

49:11.848 --> 49:14.886
Nothing like the one
that I got here.

49:16.586 --> 49:18.964
The mental scar
that will haunt me forever.

49:23.427 --> 49:27.102
So, we was traveling back
from the port of Bordeaux.

49:28.131 --> 49:29.906
A small single engine plane

49:30.867 --> 49:33.143
carrying a cargo of illegal,
endangered animals...

49:34.771 --> 49:38.218
Fourteen French Toy Poodles.

49:39.009 --> 49:40.181
Since when are poodles
endangered?

49:40.911 --> 49:42.720
Crash landed
in the middle of the Atlantic.

49:45.082 --> 49:47.926
Eleven men went into the water.

49:49.519 --> 49:51.021
Plane went down in 12 minutes.

49:53.023 --> 49:55.060
Didn't see the first poodle
for about half-an-hour.

49:57.094 --> 49:58.471
Eleven-incher.

50:00.731 --> 50:02.574
You know how you can tell
that in the water, Chief?

50:03.033 --> 50:04.011
No.

50:04.835 --> 50:06.678
By lookin' from the rhinestone collar

50:08.205 --> 50:09.377
to the poofy tail.

50:11.608 --> 50:14.054
Because we were smugglers,
no one was looking for us.

50:16.113 --> 50:17.922
Very first light, Chief,

50:20.083 --> 50:21.426
doggy come cruisin' by,

50:23.553 --> 50:24.827
Wagging his little tail.

50:26.023 --> 50:28.162
And that Poodle,
he looked right at you.

50:29.092 --> 50:30.537
Look you right in the eyes.

50:32.029 --> 50:34.031
See poodles have lifeless eyes.

50:34.564 --> 50:36.805
When he's coming,
he doesn't seem to be livin'...

50:37.401 --> 50:38.436
Till he bites ya,

50:39.169 --> 50:40.546
The ocean turns red,

50:41.605 --> 50:44.415
and despite all your poundin'
and your hollering

50:45.609 --> 50:47.111
those poodles come in and...

50:47.611 --> 50:49.022
they rip you to pieces.

50:49.880 --> 50:51.086
Hold up. Wait a minute.

50:51.481 --> 50:54.485
Are you sure these poodles
aren't possibly sharks?

50:54.985 --> 50:57.727
I told you,
we were carrying poodles.

50:58.121 --> 51:00.692
Why would we be flying
with a cargo of sharks?

51:01.091 --> 51:02.934
Yeah man,
don't ask stupid questions.

51:04.594 --> 51:06.198
I've never been so frightened.

51:06.596 --> 51:07.802
Waitin' for my turn.

51:09.533 --> 51:12.036
I'll never put on a lifejacket again.

51:14.204 --> 51:15.376
Them dogs,

51:16.039 --> 51:18.451
they could of taken us
all out all at once. But they just...

51:21.011 --> 51:23.719
let us bob in the water
like squeaky toys.

51:24.714 --> 51:29.322
It's not their teeth that
are dangerous; it's their mind.

51:31.254 --> 51:32.426
They're crafty.

51:34.157 --> 51:35.261
And that's their bite.

51:37.160 --> 51:41.040
And that's the worst bite
of them all.

51:45.035 --> 51:48.073
Bite huh.
Wait till you get a load of my bite.

52:00.550 --> 52:01.722
How long is this gonna take?

52:02.052 --> 52:03.554
Yeah, I kinda need to use the John.

52:04.521 --> 52:07.400
Can't go to the dog.
Gotta let the dog come to you.

52:09.159 --> 52:11.662
Just go. Make it quick.

52:51.134 --> 52:52.135
We got a nibble.

52:52.569 --> 52:54.845
- Reel him in.
- Not so fast...

52:55.772 --> 52:57.012
we don't want to spook him.

53:00.110 --> 53:02.613
Doofus, will you ever learn?

53:13.223 --> 53:14.930
Hey! I got it.

53:16.726 --> 53:17.864
Hooked it!

53:19.596 --> 53:20.700
Yep.

53:21.198 --> 53:22.142
Yep.

53:23.800 --> 53:24.744
Now!

53:40.116 --> 53:41.959
Man, he's a strong one.

53:42.285 --> 53:43.525
A real fighter.

54:03.039 --> 54:07.112
He's either he's very smart
or very dumb.

54:25.996 --> 54:27.998
Guys. Guys.

54:29.065 --> 54:30.100
No.

54:42.812 --> 54:44.189
I think he's caught up
on something.

54:49.319 --> 54:50.957
You guys have got to...

55:01.264 --> 55:02.743
Must have gone under the house.

55:07.304 --> 55:08.612
Where have you been?

55:09.072 --> 55:10.949
You missed all the action.

55:17.080 --> 55:18.286
We almost had him.

55:23.653 --> 55:25.132
I think we should just go home.

55:26.356 --> 55:27.699
It's still a little time for caroling.

55:28.525 --> 55:31.301
This dog is a tricky one.

55:33.163 --> 55:34.233
He's smart.

55:36.066 --> 55:37.374
But he hasn't met me.

55:37.767 --> 55:41.146
I'm gonna be a shock
to his system.

55:44.174 --> 55:46.085
- I don't get it.
- Me neither.

55:49.913 --> 55:53.486
See I have this cattle prod
and you shock animals with it.

55:53.850 --> 55:55.124
We didn't see that.

55:55.185 --> 55:57.256
Yeah, it's like electricity.
High-voltage.

55:57.687 --> 55:59.030
Yeah we understand now.

55:59.889 --> 56:00.867
Yeah.

56:02.158 --> 56:05.196
Why don't you boys stay here
and watch a master.

56:06.096 --> 56:07.598
Do his work. Ha.

56:16.039 --> 56:19.213
Here poochie, poochie, poochie.

56:21.711 --> 56:24.191
Come on where are you,
you little mutt.

56:24.514 --> 56:26.755
You think
you're smarter then me? Huh?

56:30.086 --> 56:31.929
Let's turn this baby up to 10.

56:33.590 --> 56:35.126
We'll see how smart you are.

56:42.599 --> 56:43.942
What was I thinking?

56:46.836 --> 56:50.784
Come on. Come out,
come out wherever you are.

56:52.409 --> 56:53.444
Come on.

57:00.850 --> 57:02.830
Are you my mama?

57:07.524 --> 57:08.559
What?

57:12.429 --> 57:14.500
Are you my mama?

57:19.803 --> 57:22.044
Mama. I love you.

57:22.439 --> 57:26.251
- Mama. I want to pee.
- Baby have to pee.

57:28.144 --> 57:30.624
Why you! Kidding me.

57:48.031 --> 57:49.339
What happened guys?
Did we get'em?

58:05.248 --> 58:06.693
Hey cuz, you okay?

58:08.051 --> 58:09.758
I'd like a chimichanga please.

58:10.119 --> 58:11.962
Sure, sure, sure.

58:13.823 --> 58:14.927
Here you go.

58:19.596 --> 58:22.099
- You okay to drive?
- Drive? Okay.

58:29.973 --> 58:32.579
Great. Buckle up.
See you at the family barbecue.

58:40.116 --> 58:41.618
This is taking longer
then we planned.

58:41.985 --> 58:44.090
I have to get the van back
to the fish market for delivery.

58:44.287 --> 58:48.133
So, fine that dog
and put him to sleep.

58:52.629 --> 58:56.099
Sleep huh. I have plenty
more tricks up my collar.

59:10.146 --> 59:11.056
Sweet.

59:14.984 --> 59:16.292
What's the matter doggie?

59:16.586 --> 59:18.293
Stuck in the laundry chute?

59:18.721 --> 59:22.100
It serves you right.
You little trouble maker.

59:26.829 --> 59:27.967
Who did that?

59:28.331 --> 59:29.435
Is that the dog?

59:30.133 --> 59:31.339
Guys I'm stuck.

59:31.834 --> 59:33.871
And very claustrophobic.

59:36.072 --> 59:37.574
I shouldn't have had
that bean dip.

59:45.214 --> 59:47.023
One glass ornament.

59:51.287 --> 59:52.493
Didn't hurt dog.

59:53.323 --> 59:55.735
You're gonna have
to try harder than that.

59:57.493 --> 59:59.803
Huh. One pointy lawn dart.

01:00:34.530 --> 01:00:36.009
That burns.

01:01:04.627 --> 01:01:06.265
Come rob a house they say.

01:01:06.529 --> 01:01:08.600
Oh, steal a whole bunch
of presents they say.

01:01:36.726 --> 01:01:37.932
What's going on?

01:01:56.446 --> 01:02:02.089
Help me. Jake Somebody.
Anybody.

01:02:10.126 --> 01:02:12.003
Rob what are you doing
in the laundry chute?

01:02:12.895 --> 01:02:14.966
- I thought I lost a sock.
- Huh?

01:02:15.431 --> 01:02:19.743
I'm stuck and there is something
very sharp in my butt.

01:02:21.170 --> 01:02:24.049
- Is that jingle bells?
- I thought it was the dog.

01:02:24.173 --> 01:02:26.153
You though the dog
knew Jingle Bells?

01:02:26.275 --> 01:02:27.982
Just get me out of here.

01:02:30.246 --> 01:02:31.884
Stretch your leg up towards me.

01:02:41.691 --> 01:02:42.965
It was a lawn dart

01:02:44.327 --> 01:02:45.738
The walls are closing in.

01:02:46.329 --> 01:02:49.037
I just got skewered and...

01:02:52.435 --> 01:02:55.348
Oh gosh! Give me
some warning will you!

01:02:56.239 --> 01:02:57.377
Hold on.

01:02:58.841 --> 01:03:00.320
Anybody out there?

01:03:01.010 --> 01:03:02.114
Anybody?

01:03:33.309 --> 01:03:35.084
Get me out of here.

01:03:35.711 --> 01:03:37.088
I can't reach you from here.

01:03:44.086 --> 01:03:45.064
I got an idea.

01:04:14.050 --> 01:04:16.223
Wait.
It's getting kinda hot in here.

01:04:25.494 --> 01:04:26.734
Are you okay dear?

01:04:29.632 --> 01:04:31.805
I've worked for the big guy
quite some time.

01:04:32.335 --> 01:04:34.144
Mostly herding reindeer.

01:04:34.604 --> 01:04:36.277
You are so lucky!

01:04:36.472 --> 01:04:39.476
Santa what I really want for
Christmas is a raw hayed steak,

01:04:40.042 --> 01:04:42.079
A pigs ear, A new tennis ball.

01:04:42.345 --> 01:04:44.791
Oh, and one of those
plastic hot dogs

01:04:45.047 --> 01:04:46.253
that squeak when you into them.

01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:47.823
But most of all,

01:04:48.284 --> 01:04:51.322
I want my family to have a safe
and happy holiday.

01:04:51.721 --> 01:04:53.132
That and a squeaky hot dog.

01:04:55.424 --> 01:04:57.131
Okay, we're all good.
There spare is on.

01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:00.297
But now we don't have any dogs
for Christmas.

01:05:00.997 --> 01:05:04.103
Oh, honey, don't you worry.
We are gonna find Columbus.

01:05:05.034 --> 01:05:10.006
KC don't forget,
Bone is perfectly safe and happy.

01:05:18.147 --> 01:05:19.023
Hello?

01:05:19.815 --> 01:05:20.850
Yes it is.

01:05:25.388 --> 01:05:27.299
Listen, before you get mad at me

01:05:27.623 --> 01:05:30.331
I just want to let you know
there is a perfectly good explanation.

01:05:31.093 --> 01:05:32.538
- Explanation?
- Yes.

01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:36.132
What explanation?

01:05:36.432 --> 01:05:39.902
Umm, explanation
is why I can't find Steve.

01:05:40.636 --> 01:05:42.445
- Steve?
- Steve!

01:05:43.172 --> 01:05:44.242
Who is Steve?

01:05:44.573 --> 01:05:46.644
You don't know your dog's name?
Are you kidding me.

01:05:47.043 --> 01:05:48.716
Wait, is it wrong number?

01:05:48.945 --> 01:05:50.481
My dog's name is Bone.

01:05:50.713 --> 01:05:54.024
Oh! Bone! That's right.

01:05:54.984 --> 01:05:57.931
So? Is Bone, okay?
What happened?

01:05:58.154 --> 01:06:00.225
- No. No, he's missing.
- What?

01:06:00.690 --> 01:06:02.567
Yeah. I can't find him.
I have no idea where he is.

01:06:02.792 --> 01:06:05.329
You said you'd take care of Bone
like he's your own brother.

01:06:05.494 --> 01:06:07.974
Honestly, I haven't seen
my brother in 8 years.

01:06:08.364 --> 01:06:10.037
I have no idea where he is either.

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:12.401
You...

01:06:20.543 --> 01:06:23.023
Hey Pulling... Hey! Hey!

01:06:35.324 --> 01:06:36.302
Rob you out?

01:06:39.161 --> 01:06:40.572
Why do I smell Barbecue?

01:06:41.564 --> 01:06:43.009
Help! Help!

01:06:43.366 --> 01:06:45.778
You guys!
I'm getting really pruny in here.

01:06:48.170 --> 01:06:49.171
Jake?

01:06:50.239 --> 01:06:51.274
Don't ask.

01:06:51.974 --> 01:06:53.976
Dude, I thought
you were a Sasquatch.

01:06:54.143 --> 01:06:56.054
I think we should cut
our losses and Bail.

01:06:56.278 --> 01:06:57.723
I don't care.

01:06:59.882 --> 01:07:01.486
Where are you?

01:07:04.253 --> 01:07:05.960
You're a dead dog.

01:07:08.624 --> 01:07:09.864
This way boys.

01:07:16.132 --> 01:07:19.113
Over here.
I've got a little treat for you.

01:07:19.802 --> 01:07:22.214
- Hold, hold. Hold on. Hold on.
- What? He's right there!

01:07:22.438 --> 01:07:24.475
No, he's a sneaky little mutt.
I don't trust him.

01:07:25.074 --> 01:07:27.418
I'm grabbing him
before he gets away again.

01:07:28.277 --> 01:07:29.278
Come on.

01:07:30.679 --> 01:07:31.919
A little further.

01:07:33.115 --> 01:07:34.116
Alright.

01:07:35.718 --> 01:07:37.629
A little further.

01:07:47.797 --> 01:07:48.741
Gotcha!

01:07:54.637 --> 01:07:56.241
After we clean up your house,

01:07:56.572 --> 01:07:58.984
on our way out of town
we are going to drop you off.

01:07:59.475 --> 01:08:01.250
Offa bridge that is!

01:08:09.118 --> 01:08:11.428
Merry Christmas boys!

01:08:11.987 --> 01:08:16.993
Now fill your bags
with presents!

01:08:27.203 --> 01:08:30.274
1, 2...

01:08:31.439 --> 01:08:33.920
And... 3.

01:09:41.042 --> 01:09:42.317
Who is it this time?

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:46.051
I think it's Santa.

01:09:49.151 --> 01:09:52.223
Get back. Be quiet.

01:09:59.295 --> 01:10:01.036
Merry Christmas!

01:10:01.163 --> 01:10:03.643
How can I help you
on this glorious early morni.

01:10:04.667 --> 01:10:07.443
I believe this little rag-a-muffin
belongs to you.

01:10:07.703 --> 01:10:12.880
Oh yes, yes, yes.
We've been worried sick about her.

01:10:13.175 --> 01:10:15.086
Him. Him. Him.

01:10:21.784 --> 01:10:25.095
These guys are thieves.
They don't live here.

01:10:27.890 --> 01:10:29.267
Down Diesel. Settle.

01:10:29.725 --> 01:10:30.795
Sweetheart.

01:10:31.927 --> 01:10:33.099
We gotta be going.

01:10:33.395 --> 01:10:36.968
Of course. Of course.
Can I offer you anything for a reward.

01:10:37.266 --> 01:10:38.836
That won't be necessary.

01:10:39.235 --> 01:10:42.341
I'm just so glad to get him back
to those who love him.

01:10:45.608 --> 01:10:47.519
God bless you Sir. Ma'am.

01:10:49.078 --> 01:10:49.988
Bye.

01:10:55.050 --> 01:10:56.290
Take him to the others.

01:11:12.568 --> 01:11:12.568
A donation has been made
in your name

01:11:15.004 --> 01:11:17.416
to the Fuzzy Pet Foundation.

01:11:22.511 --> 01:11:24.650
Stop. Stop. Get in. Get in there.

01:11:25.147 --> 01:11:26.217
Get in. Get in there.

01:11:27.116 --> 01:11:29.027
- Columbus!
- Bone!

01:11:35.024 --> 01:11:38.597
I bet someone will read his tag
and bring him back home.

01:11:39.328 --> 01:11:41.706
Yeah, you're probably right honey.

01:11:41.997 --> 01:11:44.409
I hope Columbus
doesn't catch a cold.

01:11:47.303 --> 01:11:50.750
It's Christmas and all they can talk
about are the dogs.

01:11:51.073 --> 01:11:53.576
I know. We should have
brought both of them.

01:11:54.543 --> 01:11:55.681
They're family.

01:11:58.247 --> 01:12:00.193
And family always comes first.

01:12:06.055 --> 01:12:08.661
I can't believe
you did all that on your own.

01:12:08.824 --> 01:12:10.394
That's an incredible journey.

01:12:11.126 --> 01:12:13.106
Sorry bro, I should have listened.

01:12:13.595 --> 01:12:16.576
We're not watchdogs.
We're not heroes.

01:12:16.999 --> 01:12:18.808
No, you were right all along.

01:12:19.034 --> 01:12:21.810
All you have to do
is find your bite.

01:12:22.171 --> 01:12:23.548
And I found mine.

01:12:24.239 --> 01:12:25.274
Your bite?

01:12:25.674 --> 01:12:29.053
We might not have pit bull jaws
or greyhound speed,

01:12:29.244 --> 01:12:31.656
but we have something
other dogs don't have...

01:12:32.314 --> 01:12:33.657
We're potty trained!

01:12:34.483 --> 01:12:36.485
No. I mean yes.

01:12:36.852 --> 01:12:38.229
But that's not the point.

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:42.991
We have a family that loves us
and we'll do anything for them.

01:12:43.225 --> 01:12:46.172
A faithful and unbridled spirit.

01:12:46.628 --> 01:12:48.130
Yeah, I've got that.

01:12:48.931 --> 01:12:50.535
Time to take these guys down.

01:12:50.966 --> 01:12:52.104
What do you say little bro?

01:12:52.534 --> 01:12:54.241
Do you want to help me
save Christmas?

01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:56.076
Darn Skippy.

01:12:56.305 --> 01:13:00.447
Cry havoc
and lets slip the dogs of war.

01:13:01.610 --> 01:13:02.680
Shakespeare wrote that.

01:13:03.011 --> 01:13:05.082
Shakespeare?
The cat down the street?

01:13:06.448 --> 01:13:09.691
We've got bite.
Let's get chomping.

01:13:11.186 --> 01:13:13.325
Hey Diesel, do you want
to stop by for some breakfast?

01:13:15.691 --> 01:13:16.669
Diesel?

01:13:19.595 --> 01:13:20.767
Something wrong dear?

01:13:24.833 --> 01:13:25.777
That's everything.

01:13:25.834 --> 01:13:25.834
No that's not everything.
Where are the dogs?

01:13:28.103 --> 01:13:30.140
Really?
They're trapped in the closet.

01:13:30.873 --> 01:13:32.352
The family won't be back
for another week.

01:13:32.508 --> 01:13:33.953
There isn't any food
or water in there.

01:13:34.143 --> 01:13:35.451
Oh, I know they're going to die,

01:13:35.811 --> 01:13:37.313
I just want to be there
when it happens.

01:13:37.546 --> 01:13:39.048
Now go get them!

01:13:44.987 --> 01:13:46.022
They're gone!

01:13:46.388 --> 01:13:48.129
I can't believe that worked.

01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:50.301
Under a blanket
dogs are invisible.

01:13:50.826 --> 01:13:52.066
Common knowledge.

01:13:52.761 --> 01:13:55.139
- They go out.
- They got out? How?

01:13:55.197 --> 01:13:55.197
Maybe he picked the lock with
like a wire hanger or something.

01:13:58.066 --> 01:14:00.103
A wire hanger? What is he?
MacGyver's dog?

01:14:00.369 --> 01:14:03.407
Doesn't matter.
We got everything. Let's go.

01:14:17.486 --> 01:14:21.093
Find them now!

01:14:24.126 --> 01:14:26.606
Here puppy puppy.

01:14:27.229 --> 01:14:29.106
I'm gonna find you.

01:15:02.431 --> 01:15:03.501
Gotcha!

01:15:17.312 --> 01:15:20.521
Oh yummy!
Treats for Santa on the mantel.

01:15:45.173 --> 01:15:46.777
Let's see what we have here.

01:16:06.695 --> 01:16:07.833
The signal.

01:16:08.330 --> 01:16:09.832
You're mine now.

01:16:22.344 --> 01:16:23.379
Rob?

01:16:24.079 --> 01:16:26.423
Told you guys
I'm claustrophobic.

01:16:29.084 --> 01:16:30.358
Let's turn up the heat.

01:16:36.592 --> 01:16:37.866
Keep it tight, Rob.

01:16:39.328 --> 01:16:40.398
Clench up.

01:16:43.231 --> 01:16:44.437
Oh no.

01:16:50.005 --> 01:16:51.040
There you are.

01:16:59.348 --> 01:17:00.258
Come here.

01:17:11.627 --> 01:17:14.403
There it is again.
I smell Barbecue.

01:17:19.167 --> 01:17:20.510
You know a lot of good tricks.

01:17:22.270 --> 01:17:23.977
Let's see how well you play dead.

01:17:27.309 --> 01:17:28.845
Let's see what you got.

01:17:29.277 --> 01:17:31.985
Mano y Dog-o.

01:17:46.161 --> 01:17:47.139
Gotcha!

01:17:54.269 --> 01:17:56.613
Okay, not a bad move.

01:17:58.040 --> 01:17:59.849
Way to go pooch.

01:18:06.615 --> 01:18:08.288
It's a little late to be buffing up.

01:18:16.825 --> 01:18:18.964
You're not gonna slip away
this time.

01:18:27.035 --> 01:18:30.642
I love the piney smell
of freshly spilled floor wax.

01:18:36.912 --> 01:18:38.084
Hey that's not cool.

01:18:48.190 --> 01:18:49.260
Turn it off!

01:18:52.894 --> 01:18:53.929
Turn it off!

01:18:54.229 --> 01:18:55.173
Turn it off!

01:18:55.864 --> 01:18:56.899
Turn it off!

01:18:57.165 --> 01:18:58.701
Now to ring your door bell.

01:19:02.404 --> 01:19:06.216
Oh my god, oh my god,
oh my god, oh my god.

01:19:18.253 --> 01:19:19.288
Sit!

01:19:20.522 --> 01:19:22.695
Stay. Heel.

01:19:31.166 --> 01:19:32.236
What's that sound?

01:19:36.171 --> 01:19:38.082
I just wanted to go caroling.

01:20:01.029 --> 01:20:03.703
Easy... Bake... Oven.

01:20:11.306 --> 01:20:12.614
You did it Bone!

01:20:13.175 --> 01:20:15.086
No, you did it buddy.

01:20:15.510 --> 01:20:16.921
Yeah, yeah you're right.

01:20:17.512 --> 01:20:18.855
Don't get cocky, kid.

01:20:23.351 --> 01:20:24.694
Hey do you smell barbecue?

01:20:33.628 --> 01:20:34.834
Take that!

01:20:36.364 --> 01:20:37.502
Thank you stranger.

01:20:37.999 --> 01:20:39.034
Diesel!

01:20:54.049 --> 01:20:57.895
Bone, think you can introduce me
to your friend over there?

01:20:58.687 --> 01:21:00.132
I'll see what I can do.

01:21:26.848 --> 01:21:29.226
- Bone!
- And Columbus is here too!

01:21:55.443 --> 01:21:57.980
That's a heck of a couple of
watch dogs you go there Mr. Conley.

01:21:58.113 --> 01:21:59.387
Protected the whole house.

01:22:00.815 --> 01:22:02.488
I suppose that's true.

01:22:02.918 --> 01:22:04.829
So one of my dogs traveled
cross country

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:06.228
with Santa to meet the other one.

01:22:06.454 --> 01:22:08.491
And take down a ring
of international diamond thieves

01:22:08.723 --> 01:22:10.259
and destroyed the whole house
in the process.

01:22:11.192 --> 01:22:13.365
Best Christmas ever!

01:22:54.402 --> 01:22:55.540
Snow!

01:22:58.173 --> 01:23:01.154
It looks like it's going to be
a real Christmas after all.

01:23:02.744 --> 01:23:06.055
Wait, it won't be a real Christmas
without grandma and grandpa.

01:23:13.088 --> 01:23:14.158
Could it be?

01:23:26.768 --> 01:23:28.372
Mom what are you doing here?

01:23:28.837 --> 01:23:30.817
So that's why there's
a German Shepard here.

01:23:31.106 --> 01:23:32.676
- Diesel's here?
- Yeah!

01:23:32.841 --> 01:23:35.287
- Oh!
- So this is your new house.

01:23:37.712 --> 01:23:38.713
Diesel!

01:23:40.048 --> 01:23:41.857
Grandpa! Grandma!

01:23:43.718 --> 01:23:45.425
Oh my goodness.

01:23:47.989 --> 01:23:49.400
- We'll get the snow.
- Good to see you.

01:23:55.063 --> 01:23:57.304
- I'm glad you guys are here.
- Oh it's so nice.

01:23:59.367 --> 01:24:01.813
We're related to Santa?

01:24:02.604 --> 01:24:05.050
It's a Christmas miracle.

01:24:06.708 --> 01:24:08.984
- Come on guys let's go inside.
- Yeah.
