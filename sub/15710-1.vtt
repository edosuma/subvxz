00:52.970 --> 00:55.644
An ambush. Cute.

01:47.024 --> 01:50.324
Well now... It's my dear sister, Anna.

01:50.485 --> 01:54.206
Nina. It's been a long time, hasn't it?

01:54.948 --> 01:59.294
It has. What do you say we celebrate?

01:59.995 --> 02:02.464
I'm just waiting on you.

03:21.243 --> 03:24.747
Look at this.
You think you've got me cornered?

03:37.259 --> 03:38.181
Nina!

03:38.301 --> 03:40.645
'Til next time. Sweet Anna.

03:44.891 --> 03:46.893
All units, pursue.
Lock down all train lines.

03:47.018 --> 03:50.067
There's no need for that.
We're pulling out.

03:50.188 --> 03:52.657
Yes, but what about the intel?

03:52.774 --> 03:54.492
Our mission is complete.

03:54.609 --> 03:57.863
It's about time for an update
from the Far East Branch, anyway.

03:58.071 --> 04:00.824
She was nothing more than bait.

04:00.949 --> 04:02.951
This was all just a decoy?

04:03.076 --> 04:06.706
To be honest, I didn't
think it would be so easy.

04:06.913 --> 04:12.010
Now we just have to wait for Jin
and the Mishima Zaibatsu to make their move.

04:23.430 --> 04:26.775
All right, what's next?
Where else do we look?

04:26.933 --> 04:29.402
Relax. It wasn't a complete loss.

04:35.650 --> 04:40.998
Every single research facility has been
shut down and the data erased.

04:43.200 --> 04:48.502
Go on. Explain to me how taking
their bait wasn't a loss.

04:50.499 --> 04:55.096
It revealed to us they're as hungry
for intel as we are.

04:55.212 --> 04:59.843
Proving that G Corp hasn't gotten
their hands on the specimen, either.

05:01.551 --> 05:04.976
Well, in that case...
Off to Russia you go.

05:05.138 --> 05:08.108
Oh? We're using it again?

05:08.600 --> 05:10.819
It's perfect for espionage.

05:10.936 --> 05:14.486
Kazuya keeps an eye on the doctor.
What if he finds out?

05:14.606 --> 05:16.108
Then let him find out.

05:18.652 --> 05:22.532
I hope you realize what will happen,
if you two fight.

05:25.325 --> 05:30.297
If the world can be destroyed by a mere
father-son quarrel, then so be it.

05:42.884 --> 05:46.889
Who are they?
Survivors of the Mutare?

05:49.182 --> 05:51.605
I finally have some good news.

05:51.935 --> 05:57.317
Our team in the Far East just sent
in a report. This is from Kyoto.

05:58.441 --> 06:02.571
We've found our target,
and he's quite handsome.

06:02.988 --> 06:07.915
So he was in Japan. Just as expected.

06:08.034 --> 06:11.584
I'll be flying to Kyoto
tonight to confirm.

06:11.705 --> 06:14.379
Run a background check first.

06:14.499 --> 06:17.719
Last thing I want is
for Jin to find out.

06:17.836 --> 06:22.182
That won't be a problem.
We're using an organic approach.

06:25.886 --> 06:29.481
For this particular job,
I have the perfect candidate.

06:30.432 --> 06:34.653
Very well then. Kyoto it will be.

07:02.005 --> 07:04.099
One minute, twelve seconds left!

07:08.470 --> 07:10.143
Hurry up!

07:25.695 --> 07:28.369
Whew. We actually made it!

07:29.699 --> 07:33.670
For a job well done!
I'll come see you at lunch, okay?

07:35.664 --> 07:39.385
Don't be so picky.
Bamboo isn't free, you know.

07:43.755 --> 07:46.224
Xiaoyu Ling of class B.

07:47.092 --> 07:50.266
I'm not late!
I have seven seconds left!

07:50.804 --> 07:54.183
You have been summoned
to the principal's office now!

07:56.226 --> 08:00.151
Expelled? Why?
Because you think I'm late?

08:00.271 --> 08:01.614
That's not it.

08:01.773 --> 08:04.822
Your gym repair bill.
Three hundred grand!

08:04.943 --> 08:08.288
We have no budget
for a student like you.

08:08.405 --> 08:11.079
You always told me
you didn't have a budget.

08:11.449 --> 08:13.793
Every time you go to P.E.
You destroy something.

08:13.910 --> 08:16.914
That's because you keep
telling me not to hold back.

08:18.748 --> 08:20.295
And then there's this.

08:20.417 --> 08:21.964
Yesterday's test results!

08:22.085 --> 08:24.008
You're flunking every subject!

08:24.796 --> 08:27.549
Come on, you don't have to be
so harsh about it.

08:27.757 --> 08:30.761
And you have a complete
lack of discipline.

08:30.969 --> 08:34.472
So in accordance with our rules,
you'll be expelled and transferred!

08:34.597 --> 08:37.020
Now. What's next, principal?

08:37.142 --> 08:39.645
Transferred?
Wait a sec, you can't do that!

08:44.816 --> 08:46.944
Principal, my butt. Who are you?

08:47.569 --> 08:49.571
Originally from China...

08:49.696 --> 08:53.291
And well-versed in the various
martial arts of her native land.

08:53.408 --> 08:56.332
Don't act like you know me!
Who the hell are you?

08:56.494 --> 09:00.465
As of today, I am your
new counselor. Get used to it.

09:01.082 --> 09:03.585
You'll be transferred to
a high school in Kyoto.

09:03.668 --> 09:07.263
Make contact with this student
and learn what you can.

09:07.422 --> 09:10.096
Huh? What are you talking about? Why me?

09:10.175 --> 09:13.349
The answer is simple.
Because you'll make a perfect spy.

09:13.428 --> 09:16.307
A spy? Whatever.

09:16.389 --> 09:21.862
I think I've heard way too much
psychobabble for one day. Later, crazy lady.

09:22.020 --> 09:26.321
The Zaibatsu isn't the only one with
access to Mishima Polytech.

09:26.399 --> 09:31.872
Before you walk out that door, perhaps you
should stop and think about how I got your data.

09:32.280 --> 09:37.127
Mishima Zaibatsu...
You mean the tournament?!

09:37.243 --> 09:41.043
Yes. See,
that's how we handle things at G.

09:41.498 --> 09:44.547
G? G Corporation?!

09:44.626 --> 09:51.475
Exactly. The only worldwide conglomerate that is
capable of thwarting the Mishima Zaibatsu's ambitions.

09:51.549 --> 09:55.395
Now I believe you know who runs G Corp.

09:56.888 --> 09:59.016
Kazuya Mishima.

10:01.768 --> 10:05.147
And checkmate, my little pawn.

10:07.774 --> 10:14.077
You'll be attending Kyogoku Academy, one of
the most esteemed international schools in Kyoto.

10:14.155 --> 10:17.580
Affluent families from around the world
send their children here.

10:17.951 --> 10:22.752
Security is air tight, making access
to personal records impossible.

10:22.831 --> 10:27.132
The best approach will be
by sending in a student of our own.

10:29.462 --> 10:32.716
Tell me, is that spelled with a Y and a U?

10:33.049 --> 10:34.892
Uh, yes! So, Mr. Lee...

10:34.968 --> 10:38.848
Excellent. Welcome to my classroom.

10:38.930 --> 10:42.901
Now, if you will.
Take a seat right over there.

10:43.101 --> 10:44.227
Uh, where exactly?

10:44.477 --> 10:47.651
Any. Just pick whichever one is available.

10:47.730 --> 10:51.576
But, sir, every seat is available.

10:54.571 --> 10:57.620
The students are busy
with the coming festival.

10:57.782 --> 10:59.409
I'm sure they'll be here tomorrow.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.415
Now, shall we begin?

11:01.494 --> 11:05.294
Aw, c'mon. Man this guy's a pushover.

11:06.040 --> 11:08.384
International schools are easy.

11:22.557 --> 11:29.236
You know, I could care less about G Corp.
If he wasn't so hot there's no way I would be doing this.

11:29.898 --> 11:33.948
The challenge is figuring out a way
for the two of us to meet.

11:35.236 --> 11:38.957
It would be great if I could just
turn a corner and bump into him.

11:39.365 --> 11:42.164
Like in some cheesy soap opera.

11:44.662 --> 11:46.255
I'm so sorry.

11:51.002 --> 11:54.506
I'm sorry, I'm in a bit of a rush.
Please excuse me.

11:56.716 --> 12:00.766
Man, running into some girl's
not gonna help me.

12:02.472 --> 12:07.649
No uniform? International schools
sure are the way to go.

12:27.205 --> 12:32.678
He should be right around
here somewhere, but where?

12:33.878 --> 12:34.549
Ow!

12:36.130 --> 12:36.926
A shoe?

12:37.006 --> 12:38.178
Oh my god!

12:41.928 --> 12:43.896
What the? That's...

12:56.484 --> 12:59.533
What are you thinking?
You'd normally be dead.

12:59.612 --> 13:00.704
Well, I'm not normal.

13:03.241 --> 13:05.164
Were you trying to...

13:05.243 --> 13:07.120
it's none of your business.

13:07.954 --> 13:09.046
Excuse me for helping.

13:09.122 --> 13:13.252
Just relax. I slipped, that's all.

13:19.007 --> 13:21.726
Hey, wait... Hm?

13:25.013 --> 13:27.311
This must have come off when...

13:36.149 --> 13:39.153
Actually, that's the second time
it's happened.

13:39.944 --> 13:43.369
What?! He's slipped off the roof twice?!

13:43.906 --> 13:46.625
Twice in the three months he's been here.

13:48.244 --> 13:54.126
First time was there. He jumped.
It was sort of like he did today.

13:54.667 --> 13:57.420
So is he actually trying to kill himself?

13:57.503 --> 14:00.882
I don't really know for sure.

14:01.299 --> 14:02.642
It's obvious!

14:02.717 --> 14:05.596
Well the first time,
he sort of lunged off the roof.

14:09.807 --> 14:14.108
I was sitting on a bench, and then suddenly
he was right on top of me.

14:14.312 --> 14:17.987
It happened so quickly.

14:18.274 --> 14:20.322
So, he fell right on you?

14:21.444 --> 14:23.822
Is this guy a friend of yours?

14:24.364 --> 14:29.541
What? Oh no. However...

14:29.952 --> 14:31.750
Oh-ho...

14:47.678 --> 14:50.773
If I get caught, I'm gonna
end up in major trouble.

15:20.086 --> 15:22.635
Anybody home?

15:44.152 --> 15:47.406
He did go to Mishima Polytechnic.

15:50.199 --> 15:55.205
Wait, that's Jin!
We all went to the same school?

16:02.879 --> 16:06.008
Why was he trying to hide this one?

16:07.091 --> 16:12.188
78M? What's that about?

16:17.643 --> 16:21.273
Jeez, it's just the fridge.
Don't scare me like that.

16:34.076 --> 16:37.125
I'm not usually the type to peep, but...

16:39.457 --> 16:42.711
I'll just take a quick look.

16:52.595 --> 16:55.269
X-Xiaoyu? Ls that you?

16:57.934 --> 16:58.981
Come on!

16:59.060 --> 16:59.731
Huh?

17:00.937 --> 17:04.316
It won't be long. The time is near.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.986
See you soon, my fair maidens.

17:10.655 --> 17:15.627
You're playing them off each other.
Excellent job, 78M.

17:16.160 --> 17:18.959
I know you're waiting to send a report,
so do it.

17:19.038 --> 17:24.840
But there's one thing...
Never call me that number again.

17:36.347 --> 17:37.849
What were you doing there?

17:38.182 --> 17:40.605
I'd like to ask you the same thing.

17:40.685 --> 17:43.484
Well I was just...
bringing him something.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.657
And you were going to give it
to him in the shower?

17:45.731 --> 17:46.857
Course not!

17:47.149 --> 17:48.901
You were peeping there, too.

17:49.026 --> 17:52.781
My intentions are far more decent
than wanting a peep show.

17:52.863 --> 17:54.080
Huh?

17:54.448 --> 17:59.830
Well to be honest
I kinda have a crush on Shin.

18:00.329 --> 18:01.205
Wham?

18:01.497 --> 18:07.379
That's why I come by his room every night,
to keep an eye on him. But why were you there?

18:07.461 --> 18:11.261
Oh, well, I was just...
This is awkward.

18:12.550 --> 18:15.975
I knew it. You're a voyeur, aren't you?

18:16.053 --> 18:17.430
That is so not it!

18:17.972 --> 18:19.815
If you don't come clean,
I'll report you.

18:19.890 --> 18:22.643
Hey, hey, wait a second.
You're just as guilty!

18:27.315 --> 18:29.909
All right, fine.
I have a crush on him too.

18:30.318 --> 18:32.741
What? Do you mean that?

18:34.113 --> 18:37.538
It's true. I also like Shin Kamiya.

18:37.617 --> 18:38.960
Really?

18:39.744 --> 18:41.712
Look, I'm sorry.

18:42.038 --> 18:46.134
This means you're my competition now!

18:46.208 --> 18:47.209
Huh?

18:47.585 --> 18:50.008
And I will not lose!

18:50.087 --> 18:52.306
Whoa, come on. Seriously?

18:52.381 --> 18:56.306
This is perfect!
You'll make an excellent opponent!

19:08.564 --> 19:11.943
So then, I'm guessing you made contact.

19:12.526 --> 19:19.034
I'd say I made more than just contact.
Fess up, this is why you chose me for this, right?

19:19.950 --> 19:23.079
Shin used to go to Mishima Polytech.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.256
And he was friends with Jin.

19:25.623 --> 19:27.796
You couldn't have told me this before?

19:38.219 --> 19:41.439
That makes them two years older than you.

19:41.555 --> 19:45.059
What is this? A mass disappearance?

19:45.142 --> 19:49.022
Out of the blue one day,
an entire class suddenly went missing.

19:49.772 --> 19:55.996
No details were given and the investigation closed.
The whole case was just swept under the rug.

19:56.404 --> 19:58.748
But one guy survived, didn't he?

19:58.989 --> 20:01.708
Correct. The only one among them
who couldn't be killed.

20:01.784 --> 20:05.539
Are you saying Shin Kamiya is
somehow immortal?

20:05.621 --> 20:08.670
Learn what you can about him.
Easy, right?

20:08.874 --> 20:13.300
This means there's a chance Jin
might make contact with Shin.

20:16.215 --> 20:20.140
I knew I picked the right person
for this job. Now then...

20:20.678 --> 20:21.804
Tea?

20:27.101 --> 20:28.774
Only three years old,

20:28.894 --> 20:33.900
Kyoto Castle is an excellent cultural legacy,
like the New Golden Pavilion.

20:34.233 --> 20:38.830
It is built on an ancient burial site where
the sacred earth goddess spirit was enshrined.

20:38.904 --> 20:42.534
Here, below the castle,
is a coffin where...

20:44.994 --> 20:48.373
And then there were none.

21:06.682 --> 21:09.105
What do you say? Let's go on a date.
You'll like it.

21:09.185 --> 21:11.313
Thanks, I'll think about it.

21:13.856 --> 21:16.405
Look, it's my savior.
Where have you been?

21:16.859 --> 21:19.032
Savior? Wh-what're you talking about?

21:19.111 --> 21:20.738
You said you'd go home with me today.

21:20.821 --> 21:21.413
Huh?

21:21.864 --> 21:24.834
Ls that true?
Did you tell him that, Xiaoyu?

21:24.909 --> 21:26.001
Not at all!

21:26.118 --> 21:28.086
We gotta go. See ya!

21:28.162 --> 21:29.584
Hey, wait.

21:48.891 --> 21:50.985
Why are you calling me your savior?

21:51.060 --> 21:52.357
She's finally gone.

21:52.436 --> 21:54.063
Who? Alisa?

21:54.605 --> 21:57.233
She wouldn't give it a rest!
I had no choice.

21:59.193 --> 22:02.242
But she does have interesting taste.

22:03.030 --> 22:07.752
A pair of tickets to the Mokujin Exhibit?
What was she thinking?

22:08.410 --> 22:10.412
You've saved me twice now.

22:10.496 --> 22:11.622
Huh?

22:12.081 --> 22:14.504
Some day,
I'll thank you properly. See ya.

22:14.583 --> 22:15.379
Wait!

22:16.126 --> 22:18.220
You dropped this the other day.

22:26.846 --> 22:31.818
That was my old school.
Mishima Polytechnic.

22:45.239 --> 22:46.832
That's a big coincidence.

22:47.867 --> 22:51.087
Never thought I'd bump into someone
from that school here.

22:55.875 --> 22:58.094
So, it's not a coincidence.

22:58.836 --> 23:01.339
Were you attending Mishima
when this happened?

23:01.422 --> 23:03.595
Dunno. It's all a blur.

23:03.841 --> 23:09.519
One night, a whole class just vanishes.
And it was your class.

23:09.638 --> 23:13.108
Sounds crazy. I have no idea
what you're talking about.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.023
But the number in the photograph...

23:16.353 --> 23:17.525
What photo?

23:21.108 --> 23:22.826
Are we done here?

23:23.110 --> 23:23.986
Yeah.

23:24.069 --> 23:25.821
Fine. Later.

23:27.281 --> 23:29.955
Hey. About Kazama.

23:31.201 --> 23:32.919
You mean, Jin?

23:33.078 --> 23:36.628
He and I used to be on the same team.
You guys talk?

23:37.625 --> 23:40.128
No, it's been years.

23:40.711 --> 23:43.430
I just hear bad rumors about him now.

23:43.505 --> 23:48.352
Like he's leading the Mishima Zaibatsu
with a huge bounty on his head.

23:48.844 --> 23:51.814
You know, it's all too much to believe.

23:53.557 --> 23:56.060
I remember him being so easy going.

23:56.560 --> 23:57.857
Yeah, me too!

24:00.564 --> 24:04.535
But unlike everything around here,
people change.

24:07.404 --> 24:14.037
Kyoto's this ancient city that stays the same,
year after year. But like all cities, it's man-made.

24:14.119 --> 24:16.668
It could never endure like nature can.

24:17.414 --> 24:23.547
Everything humans do, either good or bad,
will eventually turn to dust.

24:24.421 --> 24:25.263
W-wait!

24:29.218 --> 24:30.470
Shin...

24:31.637 --> 24:34.060
Hey, are you running away from me again?

24:34.390 --> 24:36.609
Sorry, girls. Gotta go.

24:48.320 --> 24:52.200
I think it's time we got started.

25:14.596 --> 25:16.348
Here. For you.

25:16.724 --> 25:19.193
That's so nice. Thanks.

25:23.355 --> 25:26.905
Um... Do you think
I'm coming on too strong?

25:26.984 --> 25:28.907
Too strong? For what?

25:28.986 --> 25:31.956
I mean to try and get Shin to notice me.

25:32.322 --> 25:36.828
Right, that.
I don't know what to tell you. Sorry.

25:41.915 --> 25:46.591
This love thing... It's really hard!

25:46.837 --> 25:49.886
Yeah, I know. I hear ya'.

25:52.009 --> 25:55.434
A while back,
I lost a really good friend of mine.

25:55.804 --> 25:59.854
I've never stopped missing him. Never.

26:01.060 --> 26:03.609
Were you in love with this guy?

26:03.687 --> 26:07.191
No it wasn't like that. We were just close.

26:07.566 --> 26:08.943
I-I'm sorry.

26:09.026 --> 26:11.654
Hey, I think you're doing fine with Shin.

26:11.945 --> 26:14.539
So do you believe I should keep trying?

26:14.782 --> 26:16.034
Of course!

26:16.492 --> 26:19.962
Thanks. I'm starting to feel better already!

26:20.120 --> 26:21.963
Well that was easy.

26:24.041 --> 26:29.514
Hey, I've an idea! We can settle this
battle using our talent and charm!

26:29.588 --> 26:32.512
Using what? I'm not following.

26:33.300 --> 26:38.898
The school festival. There's a popularity contest.
And all I have to do is win!

26:43.060 --> 26:45.563
See there's also a contest for the boys, too.

26:45.646 --> 26:50.402
And the winners of each contest,
usually end up becoming a couple.

26:50.943 --> 26:56.825
I know that Shin's a contestant,
so if he and I win, I'll become his girlfriend!

26:57.741 --> 27:01.996
Each contestant creates a live broadcast
and then all of the students vote on it.

27:02.079 --> 27:05.333
They vote on it?! That could get ugly.

27:05.415 --> 27:07.463
Hm? What do you mean?

27:11.547 --> 27:14.175
Look, Xiaoyu! It's about to start.

27:18.053 --> 27:22.149
Where is the AV room? I can't believe
they're recording these things live!

27:22.224 --> 27:27.276
Don't worry about it. I have no doubt that
you and I will come in first and second!

27:31.775 --> 27:33.277
Shin! It's starting!

27:34.153 --> 27:37.327
I'm Shin Kamiya, and this is my entry video.

27:38.031 --> 27:42.377
What you're about to watch is
a bid like no other for this title.

27:43.704 --> 27:45.377
Hey, who the...?

27:48.625 --> 27:51.048
Somebody! Help!

27:53.672 --> 27:56.300
Wow! He's a really good actor!

27:56.383 --> 27:59.353
Uh, that's not acting! That was real!

27:59.970 --> 28:01.142
Xiaoyu?

28:18.488 --> 28:20.582
Shin! You here?

28:22.034 --> 28:25.413
Hey... they're supposed to be
recording it live in here.

28:32.044 --> 28:33.341
Don't tell me!

28:35.464 --> 28:37.262
They weren't recording it live.

28:37.549 --> 28:40.018
So what does this mean?

28:41.261 --> 28:46.859
It means that there wasn't a live broadcast.
And that Shin's already been kidnapped.

28:47.809 --> 28:50.858
That clip was like a ransom note.

28:50.979 --> 28:53.573
Kidnapped? Ransom note?

28:55.901 --> 28:59.747
Activate emergency mode.
Code red. Begin protocol.

28:59.821 --> 29:04.201
Contact with target Shin Kamiya, lost.
Suspect, G Corporation.

29:04.284 --> 29:08.289
In contact with possible enemy agent.
Awaiting command.

29:08.413 --> 29:13.385
Hey, what's with that voice?
Hold on. Alisa?

29:13.752 --> 29:16.221
Copy. Eliminating agent.

29:18.298 --> 29:19.515
What are you...

29:21.635 --> 29:22.352
Stop!

29:30.269 --> 29:33.944
Mission complete. Roger.
Returning to base.

29:43.782 --> 29:47.332
Just what on earth are you?

29:50.956 --> 29:56.429
There's no data on her at the embassy or with
Immigration because she was imported?

29:58.338 --> 30:01.763
Alisa Bosconovitch.

30:10.434 --> 30:12.357
Mishima Zaibatsu?

30:15.063 --> 30:17.157
What? Imported item?

30:17.691 --> 30:22.822
Not only do you come back a failure,
but now you've reduced yourself to petty thievery.

30:22.904 --> 30:23.951
Ugh, Anna.

30:24.031 --> 30:28.707
I'll find the specimen. I want you to
take care of that nuisance Alisa.

30:29.119 --> 30:31.963
You knew she was working
for the other side?

30:32.039 --> 30:33.916
I wasn't certain yet.

30:33.999 --> 30:38.550
We were just waiting each other out
until one of us finally blinked.

30:39.296 --> 30:42.971
Are you mad? Then find that
little girl and destroy her.

30:43.300 --> 30:44.722
Can't... breathe...

30:46.970 --> 30:52.067
The first friend you made at
school is now your enemy.

31:12.037 --> 31:14.256
I got your message
and accept your challenge.

31:21.922 --> 31:25.597
It was all a lie from the very beginning.

31:26.176 --> 31:28.019
I failed my mission.

31:28.095 --> 31:32.316
It was nice of you to share intel despite
my shortcomings. I'm quite grateful.

31:32.391 --> 31:34.485
Were you lying when you said
you loved Shin?

31:34.559 --> 31:39.156
Perhaps. But you lied as well. Right?

31:40.357 --> 31:41.654
Alisa?

31:41.942 --> 31:43.285
We had our orders.

31:43.360 --> 31:45.954
And now I'll complete my mission.

31:46.029 --> 31:47.372
Attack mode!

32:43.879 --> 32:45.847
Your head?!

32:51.094 --> 32:53.813
I have been programmed to destroy you.

32:57.434 --> 32:59.687
I can't believe that you're a robot.

32:59.769 --> 33:01.567
Battle mode activated.

33:23.335 --> 33:26.464
How could a robot know that I was lying?!

33:26.671 --> 33:30.221
Exactly. Because I'm not human,
I see your flaws.

33:30.300 --> 33:32.302
I see your vulnerabilities.

33:38.850 --> 33:40.477
I don't believe that for a second!

34:50.505 --> 34:53.600
He was kidnapped by the G Corporation,
wasn't he?

34:54.426 --> 35:00.559
You tell me. You're the one who's good at deception.
If you wanna take me out, then just do it already!

35:00.890 --> 35:05.737
There's either conflicting data surrounding
this or once again, you are lying to me.

35:05.979 --> 35:08.653
What good would lying do for me now, huh?

35:11.359 --> 35:12.485
I don't trust you.

35:13.403 --> 35:17.749
Oh, come on.
There's no point in us fighting!

35:20.035 --> 35:21.332
Alisa.

35:27.709 --> 35:28.585
Alisa?

35:29.044 --> 35:33.015
Heat signature detected. Overhead!

35:48.647 --> 35:53.403
Saved by the mercy of a robot?
What a pathetic heroine you are.

35:53.693 --> 35:56.572
Anna. How long were you watching us?

35:56.696 --> 35:58.164
Long enough.

35:58.239 --> 36:04.667
Well look at this. It's Bosconovitch's robot.
You're not what I expected at all.

36:04.788 --> 36:07.962
You're with the G Corporation.
From whom do you take your orders?

36:08.208 --> 36:11.257
Listen scrapheap.
I don't just take orders!

36:11.336 --> 36:12.883
Now gimme intel.

36:12.962 --> 36:16.557
I want all you got on the Mishima Group
in that tin-can brain.

36:16.966 --> 36:19.060
You don't have proper clearance
for that information.

36:19.469 --> 36:22.518
I'll jam a cable in your head if I need to.

36:25.975 --> 36:28.728
Self-defense systems activate.

36:40.782 --> 36:42.830
Must adhere to programming.

36:51.710 --> 36:53.178
Xiao... yu...

36:54.671 --> 36:56.799
Alisa. Can you move?

36:56.881 --> 37:00.010
She's nothing more than
a bag of bolts. Forget her.

37:00.343 --> 37:04.189
She saved my life. This is the least
I can do for her!

37:04.264 --> 37:08.144
Feel free to do what you want,
but this will make you our enemy.

37:08.268 --> 37:13.320
I don't care. Go on, make me your enemy.
I was never on your side to begin with.

37:13.398 --> 37:16.652
So young and so naive.
No turning back now.

37:18.987 --> 37:22.992
Then I guess we're done here.
Toot-a-loo, dearie.

37:35.211 --> 37:36.713
What? What's going on?

37:41.634 --> 37:43.181
Thanks, Panda!

37:46.765 --> 37:49.268
Emergency escape mode activate!

37:52.812 --> 37:55.156
Alisa, this is awesome!

38:01.196 --> 38:03.949
Search Unit, you're up. Find them!

38:36.272 --> 38:37.649
What is it?

38:38.191 --> 38:39.738
Are you sure about this?

38:39.984 --> 38:41.076
About what?

38:41.653 --> 38:44.202
You know they're gonna come
after you too, now.

38:45.532 --> 38:48.126
Anna and Kazuya never had my back.

38:48.535 --> 38:51.709
What about you? Are you gonna try
and kill me next?

38:53.540 --> 38:55.634
Actually, it would seem I owe you one.

38:55.875 --> 39:03.680
Owe me? No. You saved my butt with
that last move. The two of us are even.

39:03.758 --> 39:08.605
Well if I'm the one who saved you last,
then aren't you the one who's in debt to me again?

39:08.680 --> 39:10.774
Isn't that how it works?

39:10.849 --> 39:13.318
That will make it go on forever.

39:13.393 --> 39:14.485
That's fine with me.

39:15.019 --> 39:19.741
I like this. If we owe each other,
we have no reason to fight. Right?

39:28.533 --> 39:30.956
Well. What a pleasant surprise.

39:31.035 --> 39:32.503
Mr. Lee?

39:33.580 --> 39:34.832
Excellent!

39:43.089 --> 39:45.933
This place is like a castle!

39:46.342 --> 39:47.764
Ls this really where you live?

39:47.844 --> 39:55.444
It is. My humble abode has 62 bedrooms,
21 full bathrooms, and 18 half-baths.

39:56.394 --> 40:00.524
This is what you could call
the premiere guest room.

40:04.068 --> 40:06.787
Please, make yourselves at home.

40:07.113 --> 40:08.956
Feel free to peruse the closet.

40:13.077 --> 40:16.581
Whoa, this is like going to the mall.
Check it out!

40:16.664 --> 40:18.666
You're right. It is.

40:20.376 --> 40:22.174
Oh, right. I forgot.

40:22.253 --> 40:26.759
Look Alisa, don't do that so much. It's creepy.
Here, let me get these for you.

40:26.841 --> 40:29.264
Thank you so much, Xiaoyu.

40:33.932 --> 40:38.733
So it would appear that the G Corporation
isn't the one responsible for the kidnapping.

40:38.811 --> 40:45.069
No. And your orders have stayed the same,
which means The Mishima Zaibatsu isn't behind it either.

40:46.235 --> 40:48.954
So then, who could it be?

40:49.113 --> 40:53.914
I don't know. But more importantly,
why is everyone after Shin?

40:54.702 --> 40:57.376
Nobody ever briefed you on this matter?

40:57.705 --> 41:00.834
Guess they felt it wasn't
necessary for me to know.

41:00.917 --> 41:04.171
Same here. They told me almost nothing.

41:05.171 --> 41:08.345
I was simply told to investigate Shin Kamiya

41:08.466 --> 41:11.766
and also to gather intel on him
and his contacts.

41:12.261 --> 41:15.731
Well then, guess we were both
pawns in their game.

41:19.018 --> 41:22.443
Those orders you received...
They came straight from Jin?

41:22.605 --> 41:25.108
Negative. They were from Nina Williams.

41:25.316 --> 41:26.738
Nina?

41:27.777 --> 41:31.577
She works for Jin.
They all call her his right hand.

41:31.948 --> 41:34.371
You ever met Jin Kazama?

41:34.951 --> 41:37.795
No, I haven't. Why do you ask?

41:38.371 --> 41:40.669
Oh, no reason.

41:54.429 --> 41:59.151
It appears she's doing her own investigation now
and ignoring our orders completely.

42:00.893 --> 42:05.899
This was my fear. It's why I warned you
against using A.I. in the first place.

42:05.982 --> 42:09.156
Sometimes in order to succeed,
you have to fail.

42:09.485 --> 42:12.489
G Corp will try and hone in on her
internal transmitter.

42:12.697 --> 42:19.797
Fine. That just means we'll have to shut down
her network link. We must also find the specimen.

42:19.871 --> 42:21.714
You're on your own now.

42:23.499 --> 42:28.426
All right, let's see what ghosts
from the past turn up this time.

42:35.178 --> 42:37.806
So, this was your old school, huh?

42:38.139 --> 42:41.359
If Mishima Zaibatsu or G Corp
didn't take him,

42:41.684 --> 42:44.437
then maybe some kind of clue
from his past will tell us who did.

42:45.063 --> 42:49.113
Yes, but please remember that I lost my net link,
and that includes any access...

42:49.192 --> 42:51.945
...I had to the Mishima Zaibatsu's data.

42:56.491 --> 42:59.290
Maybe, but there's more than
one way to get info.

43:00.203 --> 43:01.750
Yes, that's true.

43:03.498 --> 43:05.091
We can learn other things here, too.

43:05.166 --> 43:06.418
Like what?

43:06.876 --> 43:10.346
Like embarrassing things you did
when you were a student here.

43:10.421 --> 43:11.968
Well they're aren't any.

43:12.632 --> 43:14.976
Now c'mon, start scanning!

43:18.137 --> 43:21.687
Who knew my old school had so much
going on underground.

43:21.974 --> 43:27.151
Well it's protected by a thick shielding
making it detectable only by active sonar.

43:27.313 --> 43:30.237
It appears to be some kind of research facility.

43:42.120 --> 43:45.624
Look. This was where they took this photo.

43:49.544 --> 43:52.673
What is with this place? It's like a hospital.

43:52.839 --> 43:56.389
The data these machines collect
would be used for genetic engineering.

43:56.467 --> 44:00.563
Genetic engineering? Like DNA?
Can you hack in?

44:01.055 --> 44:02.773
Let me give it a try.

44:12.817 --> 44:18.574
Oh, no. There's nothing here.
All the data has been erased.

44:18.781 --> 44:22.752
It's okay. We're not sunk.
We still have other tools.

44:24.245 --> 44:27.840
Hmm... 78M.

44:28.708 --> 44:33.259
Let's see... The seventh bookshelf
eight steps away from where we are.

44:33.337 --> 44:36.307
It's the medical records. Look.

44:37.717 --> 44:41.563
All right. Let's see what's under M.

44:42.513 --> 44:45.392
Ha! I knew it! It's the group photo with Shin.

44:45.474 --> 44:50.480
This is wonderful. What's that?
It seems like there's more.

44:50.563 --> 44:54.739
Look at the chalkboard. What's written on it?

44:55.193 --> 44:58.197
Perhaps if I scan it I'll find something. Okay?

44:58.362 --> 44:59.113
Sure.

45:02.408 --> 45:06.208
Writing deciphered. Mutare Experiment.

45:06.287 --> 45:08.460
Mutare Experiment?

45:08.623 --> 45:14.676
I'll check my internal database.
Results: Latin. Definition: to change.

45:14.754 --> 45:16.631
The term dates back to the 18th century...

45:16.714 --> 45:21.686
...where it was first used in experiments by botanist
and geneticist, Dr. Hugo de Vries.

45:21.761 --> 45:25.015
It's from his experiments
the term "mutant" was derived.

45:25.097 --> 45:29.147
Mutant experiment...
It says they were looking for M cells.

45:30.353 --> 45:32.651
I can't believe they experimented on students!

45:32.730 --> 45:34.778
According to this, the only survivor was...

45:34.857 --> 45:38.612
Shin Kamiya. That's it.

45:38.694 --> 45:41.823
So then, he's immortal because...

45:42.281 --> 45:45.455
Because his genetic code
contains the rare M-cell.

45:45.534 --> 45:49.835
Which explains why he's being
targeted. What's wrong?

45:50.289 --> 45:54.260
Like me, Shin is trapped in a body
that defies nature.

45:54.335 --> 45:58.966
And he too, is thought of
as nothing more than a pawn.

46:05.137 --> 46:12.362
That says Heihachi Mishima!
Then Shin is with Heihachi!

46:12.561 --> 46:15.861
Xiaoyu... what's the matter?

46:16.941 --> 46:17.692
My god!

46:17.775 --> 46:20.528
Xiaoyu, wait! You forgot your shoes!

46:28.869 --> 46:33.249
Principal Heihachi Mishima
passed away three years ago.

46:33.582 --> 46:34.925
He's dead?

46:35.001 --> 46:40.098
He once ran Mishima Zaibatsu,
but then Kazuya killed him.

46:40.506 --> 46:43.510
Heihachi? Kazuya?

46:43.592 --> 46:48.473
I can't link this data.
For some reason my access has been denied.

46:48.889 --> 46:53.065
Heihachi was Kazuya's father.
And he's Jin's grandfather.

46:53.227 --> 46:56.697
Grandfather?
So they span three generations.

46:57.356 --> 47:01.031
The Mishima bloodline is all about
conflict and rebellion.

47:01.485 --> 47:03.829
Fathers and sons hate each other.

47:03.904 --> 47:09.252
It's weird. Whenever Jin and Kazuya meet,
Heihachi turns up too.

47:09.327 --> 47:11.455
So then that means Heihachi...

47:11.537 --> 47:13.039
I don't know.

47:14.081 --> 47:16.834
But let's find out.

47:31.390 --> 47:35.896
"As you suspected, data surrounding
Heihachi's death is inaccurate."

47:36.020 --> 47:38.443
"Who knows what happened
to him..." -Lei.

47:43.402 --> 47:46.997
What exactly is Mutare?

47:48.240 --> 47:50.743
Will this just mean more bloodshed?

47:51.911 --> 47:53.333
I hope not.

47:53.829 --> 48:03.182
It's all over for you. Take that!
Death Blow, Miracle Launcher?

48:16.685 --> 48:18.187
Go, Rocket Fist!

48:21.440 --> 48:25.035
I see you don't approve.
Then how about...

48:25.111 --> 48:28.160
Skyrocket Super Punch!

48:28.406 --> 48:31.706
What is this? You think you're
a super hero now?

48:32.076 --> 48:35.205
All super powers must be named.
Those are the rules.

48:35.538 --> 48:38.257
Maybe in cartoons it is.

48:41.210 --> 48:44.009
When did you two become bosom buddies?!

48:44.463 --> 48:47.842
This battle is between humans,
so humans can stop it.

48:48.259 --> 48:49.476
Alisa?

48:50.511 --> 48:56.109
There's still time. If our will is strong enough,
we can stop this Mishima family war.

48:56.392 --> 49:02.399
Which means if my feelings are honest and true,
then I'll be able to rescue Shin.

49:02.606 --> 49:05.701
Yes, but are those feelings
real or programmed?

49:05.985 --> 49:10.491
It's true love. That's what makes
someone human, right?

49:13.284 --> 49:16.128
You know for a robot, you're kinda cheesy.

49:17.079 --> 49:19.707
Oh, look! You're smiling again!

49:21.000 --> 49:24.755
All right. I get it, I get it! Thank you.

49:25.379 --> 49:28.428
You've been sort of quiet
since we got back today.

49:28.549 --> 49:31.428
Did getting soaked in the rain
make you a bit sad?

50:11.383 --> 50:16.435
Well, good evening, my little vermin.
It's time for you to be exterminated.

50:19.141 --> 50:22.862
Alisa, it isn't the rain.

50:23.771 --> 50:25.648
What is it, then?

50:25.856 --> 50:30.032
I wonder how much more blood with be shed.

50:30.361 --> 50:31.157
Blood?

50:32.071 --> 50:33.823
Mishima blood.

50:34.990 --> 50:38.585
I'm positive it was Heihachi
who kidnapped Shin.

50:38.827 --> 50:41.171
I am so out of my league right now.

50:41.413 --> 50:45.668
So three generations are going to fight
each other over Shin.

50:49.088 --> 50:55.061
From the data I can access, there's nothing
that describes Jin and Kazuya as father and son.

50:55.135 --> 50:59.641
On the contrary, it seems Jin has actually
disowned Kazuya as his father.

50:59.723 --> 51:04.149
Look, this isn't about raw data.
Family relationships are way more complicated!

51:06.647 --> 51:10.197
I'm, I'm so sorry. Forgive me. Please.

51:12.361 --> 51:15.114
Uh... No, no. I'm sorry.

51:16.407 --> 51:19.661
There's one thing I don't understand, though.

51:19.743 --> 51:21.040
What is it?

51:21.412 --> 51:24.291
Is it wrong for families to fight like this?

51:25.040 --> 51:25.791
Huh?

51:26.834 --> 51:29.087
I have a father too, you see.

51:30.838 --> 51:33.136
It's the professor who built me.

51:33.674 --> 51:37.178
Part of my embedded programming
is to search for him.

51:37.428 --> 51:39.647
But what if my objective...

51:40.055 --> 51:42.228
I doubt it's to fight him.

51:43.350 --> 51:46.980
Chances are he just wants to see you again.

51:47.479 --> 51:51.700
He's your dad. He programmed you
to try and find him because he misses you.

51:51.984 --> 51:56.239
But the Mishima family...
What if he's like they are?

51:57.031 --> 52:00.626
Listen, they're not even human now.

52:03.370 --> 52:05.088
That's really awful.

52:12.755 --> 52:14.302
Xiaoyu?

52:14.590 --> 52:17.309
Alisa, you're just like a refrigerator.

52:17.384 --> 52:18.306
Huh?

52:19.720 --> 52:23.645
When I was a little girl,
I'd press my cheek up to the fridge at home.

52:23.724 --> 52:29.356
It was kinda warm to the touch
and the hum was sorta comforting.

52:29.897 --> 52:33.367
How could a refrigerator possibly feel warm?

52:34.109 --> 52:39.787
Believe me, Alisa, it was warm.

52:41.784 --> 52:47.712
Xiaoyu? Are you recharging now, too?

52:57.800 --> 53:01.100
Good night and sweet dreams, Xiaoyu.

53:10.187 --> 53:13.487
Sleep well now, my kittens and panda.

53:31.792 --> 53:35.217
G Corp is on the move.
They got a jump on us.

53:37.339 --> 53:41.344
All right. I'll go ahead
and restore Alisa's network link then.

53:41.552 --> 53:43.145
Give her a fighting chance.

54:00.028 --> 54:01.826
Network status linked.

54:03.031 --> 54:05.910
What? You're back online now?

54:08.245 --> 54:12.295
Cross referencing Heihachi Mishima
and Mutare Experiment.

54:17.254 --> 54:22.351
Scanning internal documents. Searching classified
files from the Mishima Zaibatsu database.

54:22.760 --> 54:25.730
Three years ago they acquired
a genetic research facility.

54:25.804 --> 54:28.899
Searching for specimen transfer locations now.

54:30.017 --> 54:31.234
A tomb?

54:32.352 --> 54:34.730
The Mokujin Exhibit.

54:35.397 --> 54:39.493
Kyoto Castle! Shin's gotta be there, too!

55:00.130 --> 55:02.508
I'm afraid your time is up, kiddies.

55:02.591 --> 55:07.313
But look on the bright side.
At least you've got a nice warm bed to die in.

55:07.513 --> 55:08.184
Kill them!

55:15.103 --> 55:15.774
Enough!

55:22.861 --> 55:25.205
They've escaped! But how?

55:26.281 --> 55:27.248
What'?!

55:52.558 --> 55:56.313
Well, now. I see you've been busy, Anna.

55:56.562 --> 56:00.567
I like my work. It's good to see you, Nina.

56:04.820 --> 56:06.788
Man. That was way too close!

56:06.864 --> 56:09.287
I'm glad my connection was restored.

56:09.366 --> 56:12.586
But I wonder why the feed was
suddenly switched back on.

56:12.661 --> 56:14.959
Long as you've got full bars, who cares?

56:15.038 --> 56:19.384
True. Finding Shin is our only priority!

56:39.980 --> 56:40.981
Shin!

56:50.157 --> 56:51.033
It's him!

56:56.705 --> 56:58.423
Shin! Are you all right?

56:58.498 --> 57:00.375
Say something! Are you hurt?

57:02.377 --> 57:05.631
Well done, you two.
You lured them right in.

57:05.797 --> 57:08.141
Lured them here? What do you mean?

57:08.216 --> 57:11.186
Thanks to you guys, the time has finally come.

57:11.720 --> 57:15.850
Don't look so confused. This is the real bait.

57:22.230 --> 57:24.608
World's first immortal cell.

57:25.317 --> 57:28.662
I'm cursed with a body that refuses to die.

57:29.571 --> 57:33.701
Your organizations have hounded me,
vying for this power.

57:34.785 --> 57:37.254
But everyone got a little careless.

57:44.044 --> 57:45.341
Jin!

57:45.420 --> 57:49.220
You came, Jin Kazama. Welcome.

57:49.967 --> 57:51.514
Shin Kamiya.

57:51.802 --> 57:54.726
I knew you would be searching for this body.

57:54.805 --> 58:01.108
All that you want is to stick me under a microscope,
so you can have this power for yourself.

58:01.228 --> 58:04.198
You'll want to control it Jin, but you can't.

58:04.564 --> 58:07.317
Like you want to free the devil inside you.

58:07.401 --> 58:11.076
That's the fate for a Mishima man like you, right?

58:11.613 --> 58:13.160
Get to your point.

58:18.954 --> 58:19.921
Kazuya!

58:20.372 --> 58:23.501
Who knew I'd be coming to a kiddy party.

58:24.167 --> 58:26.465
Shin, what are you after?

58:27.212 --> 58:30.432
You know what I want. I won't last long.

58:30.882 --> 58:33.010
I'd be glad to finish you.

58:33.885 --> 58:35.887
The stage has been set.

59:00.245 --> 59:02.623
It feels good to be back.

59:02.706 --> 59:08.964
Hiding in the shadows after you've feigned your
own death is a bore. In fact it's down right tedious.

59:09.296 --> 59:12.971
I thought I'd thrown you into the depths of hell.

59:13.884 --> 59:18.856
Hmph! If you thought that was enough to
kill me, you were gravely mistaken.

59:19.473 --> 59:26.072
This is quite the reunion. It's been years
since we were all under the same roof.

59:26.605 --> 59:28.152
It makes my blood boil.

59:28.815 --> 59:31.193
Seems you choose your allies poorly.

59:31.568 --> 59:36.790
Wrong again! He is nothing but a pawn to me.

59:36.865 --> 59:42.998
Fair enough. But don't think you're
the only one with a plan in his head.

59:43.580 --> 59:45.048
I too, have waited for this.

59:45.415 --> 59:47.042
Really?

59:47.209 --> 59:51.840
Heihachi Mishima, you are finally within my reach.

59:55.383 --> 59:59.684
Go on. Look at what you've created.

59:59.805 --> 01:00:06.029
I know that pattern. There's no mistaking it.
You're none other than 78M.

01:00:06.103 --> 01:00:07.730
I said don't call me that!

01:00:08.897 --> 01:00:10.274
The Mutare Experiment.

01:00:10.357 --> 01:00:11.028
Shin.

01:00:11.149 --> 01:00:12.742
Shin, please stop!

01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:20.415
You've no idea what this is like.
My hatred goes beyond anything you've ever seen!

01:00:21.118 --> 01:00:23.962
Just be glad you're alive, boy.

01:00:25.122 --> 01:00:30.344
I allowed myself to be used to
bring you all here.

01:00:30.418 --> 01:00:32.420
It's exactly what I planned.

01:00:32.712 --> 01:00:36.262
You let them play you like
a puppet just to kill me?

01:00:37.425 --> 01:00:42.431
So you'd feel my full wrath before you die!

01:00:53.441 --> 01:00:54.192
I've failed.

01:00:54.985 --> 01:00:58.660
You'd do well to know your place, weakling!

01:01:02.492 --> 01:01:05.962
I don't wholly despise this hatred of yours.

01:01:14.129 --> 01:01:19.306
I shall claim my vengeance by spilling
the blood of Shin Kamiya!

01:01:19.759 --> 01:01:21.727
Enough. How low will you go?

01:01:21.803 --> 01:01:24.522
The depths of hell aren't low enough for me.

01:01:24.848 --> 01:01:27.897
Know why I did this? Developed the M-Cell,

01:01:27.976 --> 01:01:33.107
manipulated data, and lured you both here
like beasts to a slaughter?!

01:01:33.773 --> 01:01:37.573
It isn't for immortality. That's not what I'm after.

01:01:37.986 --> 01:01:45.586
What I desire is power!
The absolute power that comes with the Devil Gene!

01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:47.913
It'll never be yours!

01:01:48.914 --> 01:01:54.171
I've had enough of you, 78M.
It's time for you to die!

01:01:55.545 --> 01:01:57.172
No!

01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:06.272
Oh, no!

01:02:06.348 --> 01:02:07.565
Shin!

01:02:09.768 --> 01:02:11.111
Shin!

01:02:11.353 --> 01:02:14.197
You're still here.

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:21.368
I never got the chance to properly thank you two.

01:02:24.908 --> 01:02:27.707
Don't worry about it. It's not important.

01:02:28.203 --> 01:02:31.252
Shin, why?!

01:02:37.212 --> 01:02:40.967
I had to. I was running out of time.

01:02:42.050 --> 01:02:45.099
But now I can die a human.

01:02:46.972 --> 01:02:51.352
Xiaoyu, there has to be
something we can do for him.

01:03:04.739 --> 01:03:08.209
Jin, it's up to you now.

01:03:10.036 --> 01:03:11.538
Wh-what?

01:03:15.292 --> 01:03:19.638
Shin!

01:03:25.135 --> 01:03:30.642
More blood has been shed.
This family is a curse.

01:03:31.141 --> 01:03:34.020
Jin, tell me! Why did he have to die?!

01:03:41.192 --> 01:03:43.741
I will put an end to this.

01:03:47.741 --> 01:03:51.587
Jin! Don't let hatred turn you into a monster!

01:03:52.078 --> 01:03:54.797
But I am a monster. It's all that's left.

01:03:54.873 --> 01:04:01.097
You're wrong! Can't you understand? All this
fighting is pointless! It's never going to end!

01:04:02.756 --> 01:04:07.136
It will end with this bloodline.
And that is why I fight!

01:04:08.303 --> 01:04:13.730
Well said. You see, this is our fate.
We Mishima live to fight!

01:04:13.933 --> 01:04:17.813
I've had enough talking. It's time for war!

01:04:20.565 --> 01:04:21.282
Jin.

01:04:21.566 --> 01:04:24.740
Just stay outta the way, Xiaoyu.

01:04:25.612 --> 01:04:30.334
Three generations gathered for
a wonderful family reunion.

01:06:58.348 --> 01:07:00.942
Welcome to the bowels of hell!

01:07:01.351 --> 01:07:03.820
Your final resting place!

01:08:27.979 --> 01:08:30.573
Say hello to the bowels of hell.

01:08:31.399 --> 01:08:34.152
He finally proved to be of some use.

01:08:34.944 --> 01:08:37.993
Thanks to him,
I no longer have to track you down.

01:08:38.448 --> 01:08:43.078
I hope you like it here.
Because it will be your grave.

01:09:18.946 --> 01:09:21.448
So that's the Devil Gene's true form.

01:09:21.616 --> 01:09:23.993
The devil gene acts like a catalyst.

01:09:24.077 --> 01:09:28.002
It strengthens his cellular compounds
to ten times that of a normal human.

01:09:28.081 --> 01:09:31.881
They must have experimented on
Shin with Kazuya's blood.

01:09:31.959 --> 01:09:35.259
And that's the reason
Jin wants to end everything.

01:09:46.765 --> 01:09:49.189
Is this all you've got?
Where's that power?

01:09:55.817 --> 01:09:56.488
Jin, no!

01:09:56.567 --> 01:09:57.318
Wait, Xiaoyu.

01:09:57.402 --> 01:09:59.245
Alisa! Don't do this!

01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:02.824
Emergency programming. I'll handle him.

01:10:02.907 --> 01:10:05.126
Stupid girl! Get out of my way.

01:10:05.326 --> 01:10:08.876
Alisa, power down. Enter standby.

01:10:14.168 --> 01:10:17.468
What did you do to her? Alisa!

01:10:18.423 --> 01:10:21.677
Hiding behind a doll?
You disappoint me, Jin.

01:10:47.785 --> 01:10:51.665
What have they done?
She has nothing to do with this!

01:10:52.373 --> 01:10:57.721
You're right. She doesn't.
That's why I shut her down.

01:10:58.171 --> 01:11:00.515
This is not a fight for little girls.

01:11:00.798 --> 01:11:05.895
Yes. It's time I put an end
to this. For good.

01:11:07.930 --> 01:11:09.227
Jin, stop this!

01:11:21.694 --> 01:11:24.322
You're finally showing your true self.

01:11:25.406 --> 01:11:31.709
If you want to end the Mishima bloodline,
then I have no choice. I must finish you!

01:12:28.261 --> 01:12:32.937
You're too weak for this.
You can't control the Devil's Power.

01:13:17.018 --> 01:13:18.770
This can't be!

01:13:24.317 --> 01:13:27.867
I never needed the M-cell. I can control it.

01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:31.165
What? You're able to control it
with reason alone?

01:14:13.032 --> 01:14:16.127
Now the devil's power is mine.

01:14:18.412 --> 01:14:21.541
Don't think that this is over.

01:15:00.621 --> 01:15:04.467
Tell me. You let them get away, didn't you?

01:15:13.676 --> 01:15:15.019
Are you hurt?

01:15:16.721 --> 01:15:17.722
I'll be fine.

01:15:17.805 --> 01:15:20.558
Copy. We'll dispose of
this woman and withdraw.

01:15:20.641 --> 01:15:22.359
Take her to the relief squad.

01:15:22.435 --> 01:15:25.314
Relief squad? You're letting her live?

01:15:25.563 --> 01:15:28.988
Yes. It'll prolong her humiliation.

01:15:37.950 --> 01:15:39.122
Who're you?

01:15:39.827 --> 01:15:42.580
This house was once my pride and joy.

01:15:45.416 --> 01:15:49.216
So, you're the owner.
Sorry about the mess.

01:15:49.336 --> 01:15:53.591
Tell me, why bother saving her?

01:15:54.884 --> 01:15:58.764
Ending the fun so soon would
be such a bore, don't you think?

01:15:58.846 --> 01:16:01.975
Ooh. Excellent!

01:16:19.408 --> 01:16:24.756
C'mon... Alisa, wake up!

01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:26.082
No use.

01:16:28.959 --> 01:16:32.384
If people only understand each other
through fighting...

01:16:33.631 --> 01:16:37.010
Then what was the point of us ever meeting?!

01:16:37.802 --> 01:16:41.102
Hatred can be suppressed with reason.

01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:44.935
But you must give in to it at times
or it will eat you alive.

01:16:45.768 --> 01:16:49.443
I can't believe you feel that way, Jin.

01:16:51.148 --> 01:16:54.027
I will be challenged again someday.
There's no doubt.

01:16:54.110 --> 01:17:00.163
It could be by someone more powerful
or it could even be you.

01:17:02.284 --> 01:17:04.378
Either way, I'll be waiting.

01:17:04.995 --> 01:17:06.121
Jin.

01:17:07.957 --> 01:17:12.929
I will gladly be the one to step-up
and annihilate you!

01:17:20.678 --> 01:17:25.309
Kyoto Earth Goddess!
Spirits that lie dormant!

01:17:25.391 --> 01:17:28.315
The time has come for you to rise!

01:17:45.035 --> 01:17:48.130
It would seem the legend was actually true.

01:17:48.581 --> 01:17:55.715
Behold! What you see before you
is the true form of Kyoto Castle!

01:17:55.921 --> 01:18:03.476
This is the very reason...
that I have drawn you all here!

01:18:09.393 --> 01:18:13.273
I don't believe it.
All the castle trees were Mokujin.

01:18:13.522 --> 01:18:18.449
As you can see, the legend has finally
awoken from its slumber!

01:18:18.611 --> 01:18:23.708
Its hatred is so strong,
it makes the devil seem weak!

01:18:57.566 --> 01:18:58.658
Now die!

01:19:07.284 --> 01:19:09.878
You never give up, do you?!

01:19:24.885 --> 01:19:30.016
Alisa, I can't move anymore.

01:19:31.475 --> 01:19:33.022
I'm sorry.

01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:43.783
Hm? What is the problem?

01:19:49.952 --> 01:19:53.627
Why are you waiting?
Hurry up and destroy him!

01:19:54.039 --> 01:19:57.009
Listen well, Heihachi Mishima.

01:20:02.798 --> 01:20:06.803
Enough. Stop trifling with that pet
and do as I command.

01:20:06.885 --> 01:20:09.183
We Mokujin have learned something.

01:20:09.263 --> 01:20:13.939
They have shown us the bonds that exist
between humans and their surroundings.

01:20:14.059 --> 01:20:16.653
What importance is that?

01:20:16.729 --> 01:20:22.236
You only have one purpose. And that is to
follow the commands that I give you.

01:20:24.111 --> 01:20:27.991
There is no room for
compassion in this fight!

01:20:31.744 --> 01:20:35.749
Does your thirst for power know no limits?

01:20:35.831 --> 01:20:42.635
Precisely. I will use the power of
the Spirits myself! You stand no chance!

01:20:54.975 --> 01:20:57.444
I can't believe how he's using the Spirits.

01:21:31.261 --> 01:21:35.232
Why do they keep fighting?
It's pointless!

01:21:39.686 --> 01:21:41.780
Humans should just...

01:21:43.315 --> 01:21:45.738
Should just disappear!

01:21:57.996 --> 01:22:01.045
Xiaoyu, stop it. Don't say that.

01:22:02.751 --> 01:22:03.968
Alisa!

01:22:06.547 --> 01:22:11.849
I have to say I've grown
rather fond of all of you.

01:22:13.595 --> 01:22:19.273
I learned something from Panda.
Let me show you.

01:22:21.270 --> 01:22:29.530
As your refrigerator,
I promise to do my best!

01:22:31.572 --> 01:22:33.245
Alisa, stop!

01:22:45.919 --> 01:22:47.512
Skyrocket...

01:22:51.133 --> 01:22:52.806
Super...

01:22:54.803 --> 01:22:56.771
Punch!

01:23:21.955 --> 01:23:26.085
It's time to end this. Now!

01:23:31.381 --> 01:23:32.223
What?

01:23:42.851 --> 01:23:46.025
This cursed bloodline must end!

01:23:49.233 --> 01:23:50.450
Now!

01:25:09.563 --> 01:25:10.689
Jin.

01:25:10.856 --> 01:25:13.655
This is the human bond they spoke of.

01:25:14.318 --> 01:25:19.791
Humanity survived because of her.
Because a robot believed in us!

01:25:20.741 --> 01:25:22.743
Who'd have guessed.

01:25:24.620 --> 01:25:28.796
You think this is irony?
No, this is karma.

01:25:29.416 --> 01:25:32.260
Only humans can stop their own destruction.

01:25:32.419 --> 01:25:33.887
If they don't...

01:25:35.714 --> 01:25:38.843
Reboot system. Exit standby mode.

01:25:43.597 --> 01:25:44.940
Xiaoyu?

01:25:45.015 --> 01:25:47.689
Alisa! Jin!

01:25:48.769 --> 01:25:53.866
I know that one day you will come
to defeat me. And I'll be waiting.

01:27:16.356 --> 01:27:19.576
Know how to achieve world peace?

01:27:19.651 --> 01:27:23.155
We should get the whole wide world to
turn into one big amusement park.

01:27:23.238 --> 01:27:26.458
So then, your dream is
a Global Theme Park?

01:27:26.533 --> 01:27:30.163
Yup! Then that way
everybody will be happy.

01:27:30.787 --> 01:27:33.131
You know what? Leave that up to me.

01:27:33.832 --> 01:27:35.675
It's like you're speaking in code again.

01:27:35.751 --> 01:27:41.554
No, listen. I have data stored for Jin, Kazuya,
and Heihachi. Specifically, battle data.

01:27:42.048 --> 01:27:46.724
If I analyze it then, I might spot
a weakness in the Devil Gene.

01:27:47.554 --> 01:27:49.431
Oh, I get it.

01:27:50.307 --> 01:27:52.651
So... the Tekken Tournament, huh?

01:27:57.981 --> 01:27:59.699
Sure! I say we both enter!

01:28:00.108 --> 01:28:04.659
What? You want me to enter as well? Really?

01:28:04.863 --> 01:28:09.209
Of course. I mean we're friends, aren't we?

01:28:09.618 --> 01:28:13.213
Yes, Xiaoyu. We are friends.
