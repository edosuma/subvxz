WEBVTT

00:43.299 --> 00:44.674
Teal'c.

00:45.579 --> 00:47.323
Teal'c.

00:53.659 --> 00:55.866
Rya'c! Rya'c!

00:57.261 --> 01:01.219
Rya'c! Rya'c!

01:01.221 --> 01:02.798
- Teal'c!
- Rya'c!

01:02.820 --> 01:04.897
Easy. It's OK, now.

01:05.822 --> 01:08.490
He's coming around.

01:13.620 --> 01:16.194
The Goa'uld within me.

01:22.022 --> 01:24.740
They had to put junior back in, Teal'c.

01:24.742 --> 01:29.061
We almost lost you.
The drug didn't work, Teal'c. I'm sorry.

01:29.061 --> 01:33.604
You were calling out something.
"Rya'c." Does that mean anything?

01:36.662 --> 01:39.234
It means nothing.

02:52.504 --> 02:56.105
When we removed Teal'c's Goa'uld,
his major organs began to shut down

02:56.106 --> 02:58.224
and he ran a high fever.

02:58.225 --> 03:00.506
- So the drug failed?
- Yes.

03:00.507 --> 03:03.264
But it proves the Goa'uld
is Teal'c's immune system.

03:03.265 --> 03:07.264
If we can learn about it and duplicate
its effect, we can save lives on Earth.

03:07.264 --> 03:09.756
Without killing Teal'c in the process.

03:09.906 --> 03:14.544
Well, I guess the boys in Langley
won't be able to study a Goa'uld after all.

03:14.545 --> 03:17.344
It is still a possibility.

03:17.346 --> 03:20.865
You can't. You don't have an immune
system without your Goa'uld.

03:20.866 --> 03:25.161
- We can't play with your life like that.
- There are Goa'uld larvae on Chulak.

03:25.266 --> 03:27.591
- Chulak?
- Yeah, right

03:30.227 --> 03:32.302
You're kidding, right?

03:34.108 --> 03:37.266
It is one of the few worlds in the galaxy
with such an abundance.

03:37.268 --> 03:40.146
But, Teal'c, if you recall,
last time we were there...

03:40.146 --> 03:43.667
We had to shoot our way out,
maybe made a bad impression...

03:43.668 --> 03:47.001
It's out of the question. I can't authorise it.

03:52.348 --> 03:54.840
Then I will speak of it no further.

03:57.468 --> 03:59.543
<i>Dismissed.</i>

04:02.027 --> 04:05.776
- What was that?
- I don't know. I'll find out.

04:19.910 --> 04:21.985
Mind if I...?

04:28.707 --> 04:30.783
Yeah.

04:32.670 --> 04:35.125
Look, um, I'm sorry if I didn't...

04:38.069 --> 04:41.735
You do understand
why we can't go back to Chulak, right?

04:46.629 --> 04:49.427
They'll get that drug to work
before that thing dies...

04:49.428 --> 04:52.002
I am not concerned about my life.

04:52.470 --> 04:54.677
I am concerned for the life of my son.

04:56.591 --> 04:59.959
- Your son?
- His name is Rya'c.

05:00.949 --> 05:04.817
I have not spoken of him, or of my wife.

05:10.391 --> 05:13.226
You left a family back there?

05:20.831 --> 05:23.038
Oh, Teal'c.

05:24.072 --> 05:28.569
You told the... No, you swore to
the general you had no ties back there.

05:30.351 --> 05:32.670
Why didn't you tell us the truth?

05:32.672 --> 05:37.334
A warrior becomes vulnerable
if his family is held hostage to the enemy.

05:38.790 --> 05:41.495
You didn't think we'd trust you if we knew.

05:42.552 --> 05:46.512
Teal'c, how the hell
are we supposed to trust you now? Huh?

05:46.512 --> 05:49.430
You got any more surprises?

05:51.151 --> 05:55.197
With or without you, O'Neill,
I must return to Chulak.

05:55.632 --> 05:57.957
Either way, it's suicide, my friend.

05:59.432 --> 06:02.101
Within days, my son will come of age.

06:02.312 --> 06:05.233
He will be called to
the religious life of our world.

06:05.233 --> 06:09.314
He will undergo the ceremony
of implantation, the Prim'ta.

06:10.713 --> 06:13.952
The day when a young boy
receives his first Goa'uld symbiote,

06:13.954 --> 06:16.312
and becomes a true Jaffa.

06:16.314 --> 06:21.673
- Just as all of the Jaffa before him.
- I take it you don't want that to happen?

06:21.673 --> 06:25.257
It is the means by which
the Goa'uld enslave the Jaffa.

06:26.314 --> 06:29.398
I am not the only one
among my people who believes this.

06:29.593 --> 06:32.913
My first teacher, the Jaffa master Bra'tac,

06:32.915 --> 06:36.283
he knew very well
the Goa'uld are false gods.

06:39.675 --> 06:41.752
But I cannot...

06:45.274 --> 06:49.271
I will not allow my son to become a slave.

06:53.516 --> 06:57.355
- Absolutely not.
- With respect, we've considered the risks.

06:57.355 --> 07:00.634
- You have, have you?
- Yes, and we are all behind Teal'c, sir.

07:00.636 --> 07:03.274
I can see that. What I can't see is why.

07:03.274 --> 07:06.954
There's more to be gained from
the mission than a single larval Goa'uld.

07:06.956 --> 07:09.274
- Such as?
- The warrior Jaffa class

07:09.276 --> 07:13.915
are the foundation of Goa'uld power,
incubators for the young and their army.

07:13.915 --> 07:17.636
An army made invulnerable by the
restorative powers of the Goa'uld larvae.

07:17.637 --> 07:21.355
- It's literally a Faustian bargain.
- Teal'c claims there are other Jaffa

07:21.356 --> 07:23.795
who believe in freedom
from the Goa'uld as he does.

07:23.797 --> 07:27.076
Imagine the strategic advantage
if we could undermine the loyalty

07:27.076 --> 07:29.636
of the very group
the Goa'uld depend on for power.

07:29.637 --> 07:32.596
How many of these other Jaffa
can you be sure of?

07:32.598 --> 07:34.715
We're pretty sure of at least...

07:34.716 --> 07:38.276
- Uh, one... guy.
- One?

07:38.276 --> 07:42.356
Yes. And where there's one,
there has to be more... than one.

07:43.836 --> 07:45.663
Oh, absolutely.

07:45.997 --> 07:49.165
Colonel, will you join me
in my office a moment?

07:51.637 --> 07:54.211
Sure.

07:56.879 --> 07:58.954
Shut the door.

08:02.437 --> 08:04.514
Have a seat, Jack.

08:13.637 --> 08:17.038
- This is not my first barbecue, Colonel.
- Sir?

08:17.038 --> 08:21.637
I'd love to get a Goa'uld larva
that the lab coats in Langley can study.

08:21.639 --> 08:24.637
But I don't send my best people
on a mission behind enemy lines

08:24.639 --> 08:27.757
unless I think it's absolutely necessary.

08:27.759 --> 08:31.997
- I believe it is, sir.
- Why? You're not telling me something.

08:31.999 --> 08:36.438
If you don't wanna come clean about the
real motivation behind this mission, fine.

08:36.440 --> 08:39.719
The mission is not approved.
You will go where I tell you to go.

08:39.720 --> 08:42.424
- Sir, this...
- Dismissed!

08:53.600 --> 08:57.466
General, Teal'c has a son.

08:57.760 --> 09:00.927
- What did you say?
- Back on Chulak.

09:01.960 --> 09:06.519
His kid's about to be implanted with
one of those larva things at a ceremony.

09:06.520 --> 09:09.307
- Teal'c wants to stop it.
- Why?

09:11.160 --> 09:15.200
- Why, sir?
- As an enemy soldier, he's compromised.

09:15.201 --> 09:19.000
General, he was afraid we wouldn't trust
him if we knew he had a family there.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.076
Was he right?

09:22.601 --> 09:26.812
When Teal'c saved our lives on Chulak,
he gave up his family, sir.

09:27.522 --> 09:29.679
Don't you think we owe him something?

09:37.601 --> 09:41.470
Teal'c! What are you doing?
Stand back from the keyboard.

09:42.120 --> 09:44.402
I am returning to Chulak for my son.

09:44.403 --> 09:46.975
No. I'm sorry, I can't let you do that.

09:59.241 --> 10:03.073
C'mon, Teal'c. Don't do it this way.

10:03.363 --> 10:07.990
I risk no one's life but my own.
Why will you not let me return?

10:08.123 --> 10:12.523
You know far too much about this
command, this facility, our defences.

10:12.524 --> 10:17.361
- I can't let the enemy get that knowledge.
- I will die before allowing that to happen.

10:17.363 --> 10:22.701
Damn it, that's just what's going to
happen if you go through that gate alone.

10:28.923 --> 10:32.724
Which is why I am inclined
to authorise a mission to return to Chulak

10:32.725 --> 10:35.559
and allow you to bring your son back.

10:50.963 --> 10:53.501
Thank you, General Hammond.

10:55.764 --> 10:59.299
- When is this ceremony to happen?
- Within the day.

11:11.846 --> 11:13.922
Daniel. Your glasses.

11:17.407 --> 11:20.125
<i>O'Neill. I am in your debt.</i>

11:20.125 --> 11:22.201
Ah, it's nothing.

11:23.687 --> 11:25.763
We shall return.

11:26.847 --> 11:29.365
Ready to ship out, sir.

11:29.366 --> 11:31.490
Godspeed, Colonel.

12:01.607 --> 12:03.927
These are scholars
from the court of Apophis.

12:03.927 --> 12:06.047
I am to escort them to the temple.

12:06.048 --> 12:09.847
- Why do you hide your face, my lord?
- My helmet was damaged in combat.

12:09.849 --> 12:13.633
- It must be repaired.
- Perhaps I can help.

12:14.448 --> 12:16.405
Nemeth kree!

12:17.088 --> 12:19.129
You dare touch me, priest?

12:25.369 --> 12:28.784
I shall tell Apophis
of your vigilance, priest.

12:29.208 --> 12:31.782
You shall be rewarded.

13:05.130 --> 13:10.370
We'll go directly to my former home.
The ceremony should take place there.

13:10.370 --> 13:12.613
All right, Teal'c. Show us the way.

13:37.892 --> 13:42.186
<i>- Teal'c, is this your...
- My former home.</i>

13:42.971 --> 13:45.926
A gift from Apophis
for many years of service.

14:21.933 --> 14:24.614
What does this mark mean?
I don't recognise this.

14:24.615 --> 14:27.450
This was the home of shol'va.

14:28.893 --> 14:30.969
Traitor.

14:33.815 --> 14:37.433
Well, it looks like
this happened a long time ago.

14:37.575 --> 14:42.652
There's no reason to think your wife and
son were in the house when it happened.

15:16.894 --> 15:22.696
Teal'c, Carter's right. You don't know
what's happened here for sure.

15:22.697 --> 15:24.855
Olvy'tac! Shweek! Shweek!

15:24.856 --> 15:26.350
Shweek!

15:29.898 --> 15:32.019
Tek matte, Bra'tac.

15:36.177 --> 15:39.011
- Teal'c!
- It is good to see you, friend.

15:45.258 --> 15:48.625
- Were I an enemy, you would be dead.
- My wife and son?

15:49.738 --> 15:51.980
I am told they escaped the burning.

15:53.457 --> 15:57.177
I thought you might return
in time for your boy's ceremony, Teal'c.

15:57.177 --> 15:59.466
Brave, but unwise.

16:00.058 --> 16:03.135
If you were awaiting my return,
perhaps there are others.

16:03.136 --> 16:05.212
Others don't know you as I do.

16:06.138 --> 16:08.297
But I expected you to come alone.

16:10.018 --> 16:12.140
They are friends.

16:12.938 --> 16:15.576
Colonel O'Neill.

16:15.577 --> 16:18.817
Captain Carter. Daniel Jackson.

16:18.818 --> 16:22.217
- Warriors of great skill and cunning.
- Oh, Teal'c. That's...

16:22.219 --> 16:26.976
My first teacher, Bra'tac. The greatest
Jaffa master I have ever known.

16:26.977 --> 16:29.456
It's an honour to meet you, sir.

16:29.457 --> 16:34.138
You. You were among the warriors
who defeated the palace guard at Chulak?

16:34.139 --> 16:37.019
- A human woman!
- Hey. I'll have you know I kicked my...

16:37.019 --> 16:40.269
And you!
A warrior of great skill and cunning?

16:41.019 --> 16:43.096
I could snap you like kindling!

16:43.820 --> 16:47.100
How could you bring
these ha'shak with you?

16:47.100 --> 16:49.177
Hey, hey. Hey!

16:50.178 --> 16:53.014
Who you callin' a hassock?

16:55.938 --> 16:58.500
- What's a hassock?
- You challenge me, ha'shak?

16:58.500 --> 17:02.831
<i>- No. I don't think we came to fight you.
- A shame.</i>

17:07.260 --> 17:11.387
We're here on a mission. If you don't
wanna be a part of it, just say so.

17:16.862 --> 17:19.980
You choose your friends well, Teal'c.

17:21.622 --> 17:26.329
Though, were I a hundred years younger,
it might not have been quite so easy.

17:27.060 --> 17:30.016
You're over a hundred years old?

17:30.741 --> 17:33.412
God, I'm sorry.

17:43.221 --> 17:47.006
- 133.
- You must work out.

17:52.142 --> 17:56.142
No one has ever defied the Goa'uld
and lived to tell of it.

17:56.143 --> 17:59.820
There was much talk in Chulak
of the warriors of Earth.

17:59.822 --> 18:02.527
- Really?
- Our time here is limited.

18:08.742 --> 18:10.984
Can you take us to find my wife and son?

18:12.983 --> 18:16.353
Your family is Kresh'ta. Outcasts.

18:16.784 --> 18:20.982
The Kresh'ta live in
a handful of camps outside the city.

18:20.983 --> 18:23.384
I do not know which one
your family belongs to.

18:23.384 --> 18:26.135
- Then we should begin now.
- Teal'c...

18:29.784 --> 18:33.116
I would not leave Chulak
without seeing my son.

18:37.585 --> 18:41.222
Captain, I want you and Daniel
to go back to the Stargate.

18:41.223 --> 18:45.184
Take up positions where you can
lay down cover fire. We might need it.

18:45.185 --> 18:49.023
- Yes, sir.
- A minute ago we were warriors of skill.

18:49.025 --> 18:54.315
Wait there for us for 24 hours. If we're
not back by then, we probably won't be.

18:55.625 --> 18:59.243
Yes, sir. We'll be waiting. Good luck, sir.

19:06.306 --> 19:11.384
If we are discovered, you will be
brought before Apophis along with us.

19:11.385 --> 19:13.944
We'll have to cross
that bridge when we come to it.

19:13.945 --> 19:16.946
No. The bridge is too well guarded.

19:17.905 --> 19:21.321
No, actually, there,
I was using a clichÃ© that...

19:21.948 --> 19:25.779
Kel shak, my friend.
Honour us with your guidance.

19:27.146 --> 19:30.729
We go south.
Those camps nearest the city.

19:31.267 --> 19:33.887
- I believe your wife would go there.
- I agree.

19:37.746 --> 19:39.822
South is good.

19:54.028 --> 19:57.947
<i>Hey, Teal'c.
Maybe Bra'tac's feelin' a little tired.</i>

19:57.948 --> 20:01.746
<i>- Might wanna take a little rest...
- You will follow. We will lead.</i>

20:01.747 --> 20:04.586
No, no, no, actually, you see,
I'm in charge here.

20:04.587 --> 20:08.707
The Stargate is well patrolled. Your
deceptions will not work a second time.

20:08.708 --> 20:11.587
You will need my help
to stay alive, human.

20:11.588 --> 20:13.747
Yeah, all right. Whatever. I'm easy.

20:13.749 --> 20:18.587
Teal'c tells me your world is
without gods. Difficult to imagine.

20:18.588 --> 20:23.664
Oh, it's not without gods.
A lot of people believe there's a God.

20:24.469 --> 20:28.708
Not everyone believes in the same God
the same way, but...

20:28.709 --> 20:32.667
Well, nobody believes in anyone with
glowing eyes and a snake in his head.

20:32.669 --> 20:34.744
Then you serve no one?

20:34.750 --> 20:37.387
I serve the SGC
under a General Hammond.

20:37.388 --> 20:39.748
So, this Hammond is...

20:39.749 --> 20:42.028
Just a man.

20:42.029 --> 20:45.778
A very good, very... bald man from Texas.

20:47.269 --> 20:52.263
Poor Teal'c. What he must have gone
through, keeping quiet about his family.

21:05.950 --> 21:10.243
- Jaffa priests. That's Apophis's emblem.
- What are they carrying?

21:25.671 --> 21:27.997
- What's that?
- It's a bell.

21:29.031 --> 21:31.107
As in church bell?

21:31.872 --> 21:34.070
Probably.

21:34.072 --> 21:36.314
I haven't been to church in a while.

22:14.193 --> 22:16.269
Hurry! Hurry!

22:27.993 --> 22:30.484
Priest. Stand aside.

22:31.233 --> 22:34.270
Teal'c. The traitor.

22:37.755 --> 22:40.594
You dare to show yourself, shol'va?

22:40.595 --> 22:43.114
I have no wish to harm you, priest.

22:43.115 --> 22:46.779
But I will not allow you
to perform the Prim'ta on my son.

23:07.635 --> 23:08.750
Teal'c!

23:15.435 --> 23:17.511
And this would be...?

23:17.516 --> 23:19.592
My wife. Drey'auc.

23:23.237 --> 23:25.313
No!

23:45.076 --> 23:47.796
I had to beg the priests
to perform the ceremony.

23:47.797 --> 23:50.876
They brought the tablet
and the tent all the way to camp!

23:50.877 --> 23:54.717
- Why have you returned?
- My son will not be a slave, Drey'auc.

23:54.718 --> 23:57.006
He will taste freedom, as I have.

24:04.038 --> 24:08.747
Freedom, Teal'c?
You have condemned your son to death!

24:19.000 --> 24:21.998
Your heresy is an abomination, Teal'c.

24:21.999 --> 24:24.204
Even by the outcasts, I am shunned.

24:24.638 --> 24:27.797
The abomination is
my people enslaved by the Goa'uld.

24:27.798 --> 24:31.547
How can you call the gods
that you served for so long your enemy?

24:31.838 --> 24:34.598
Since the Earth people opened my eyes.

24:34.599 --> 24:37.199
The Prim'ta is slavery.

24:37.200 --> 24:39.655
Did you see where I am raising your son?

24:41.160 --> 24:45.238
Is this better than the home
that Apophis granted you as first prime?

24:45.239 --> 24:47.315
It is not.

24:48.400 --> 24:50.855
You have abandoned and betrayed us.

24:53.119 --> 24:58.874
Do you know what I have endured to
convince the priest that we are still loyal?

24:59.119 --> 25:03.200
They were about to lift the banishment
so that we could return to the city!

25:03.201 --> 25:06.784
So you want this
more for yourself than for our son?

25:10.039 --> 25:12.519
- I will speak to him.
- No! No!

25:12.519 --> 25:14.893
- He believes you are dead.
- Dead?

25:15.601 --> 25:19.759
- It is easier than the truth.
- What have you told him, woman?

25:19.760 --> 25:22.251
What would you have me tell him?

25:24.481 --> 25:27.567
That a father left his son
for people he does not know?

25:28.002 --> 25:30.601
Who are not his blood?

25:30.602 --> 25:34.813
You tell him that, husband.
You witness the dishonour in his eyes.

25:37.402 --> 25:39.478
- Drey'auc.
- Come.

25:40.240 --> 25:44.155
Carry your son back to the hovel
that has become his home.

26:50.525 --> 26:52.814
We have to get a closer look.

27:16.644 --> 27:18.721
Rya'c?

27:22.886 --> 27:24.630
Rya'c.

27:26.567 --> 27:28.808
Father!

27:37.486 --> 27:39.644
I knew he was not dead.

27:41.686 --> 27:44.521
How long has the sickness been in him?

27:45.727 --> 27:47.969
Since we were driven from our home.

27:48.727 --> 27:51.978
Do you understand now?

27:53.807 --> 27:57.426
Without the healing powers
of the Goa'uld, he will die.

28:03.167 --> 28:05.243
What have I done?

28:08.807 --> 28:11.298
- How's he doin', Teal'c?
- He is dying.

28:14.729 --> 28:18.477
I'm no doctor,
but I know scarlet fever when I see it.

28:21.729 --> 28:24.448
Can it be treated
by your Earth medicines?

28:24.449 --> 28:27.236
Ah, there's some vaccines, antibiotics.

28:36.888 --> 28:38.964
Give that to him.

28:44.410 --> 28:46.403
I thank you.

28:46.410 --> 28:48.929
It won't cure him, you know.

28:48.930 --> 28:51.807
It'll take more powerful drugs
than I've got with me.

28:51.808 --> 28:54.689
What of your Earth doctors?

28:54.690 --> 28:58.023
If we can get him
through the Stargate, maybe.

29:07.090 --> 29:09.166
Bingo. Goa'uld larva.

29:10.329 --> 29:13.414
Out here in the open like this? No guards?

29:13.611 --> 29:16.611
Well, who on Chulak needs to steal one?

29:17.210 --> 29:19.368
We do.

29:20.050 --> 29:21.627
Right.

29:30.132 --> 29:34.211
Here. OK. We can do this.

29:34.971 --> 29:37.330
- I'm ready.
- OK.

29:37.332 --> 29:43.085
On three. One, two, three.

29:45.451 --> 29:48.786
- OK. On four.
- Four.

29:51.133 --> 29:54.003
I really, really, really hate these things.

29:57.372 --> 29:59.329
OK. C'mon.

30:05.252 --> 30:07.691
Daniel?

30:07.692 --> 30:09.768
What are you thinking?

30:10.854 --> 30:15.332
Just that every single one of these infant
Goa'ulds will one day take a human life.

30:15.333 --> 30:17.732
- And all I have to do is...
- If we kill them

30:17.733 --> 30:23.452
when they're as vulnerable as they are
now, we'd be no better than the Goa'uld.

30:23.453 --> 30:25.529
Let's go.

31:00.856 --> 31:03.063
He's burning.

31:06.095 --> 31:08.253
Carter and Daniel should be here.

31:13.616 --> 31:16.451
Oh! He no longer draws breath, Teal'c.

31:16.896 --> 31:19.767
Rya'c. Rya'c!

31:20.336 --> 31:24.286
- We should try to make it to the Stargate.
- By then it will be too late.

31:26.777 --> 31:28.934
There is another way.

31:28.936 --> 31:31.012
No. No. No.

31:40.176 --> 31:46.547
Teal'c. Think about this. You can't live for
more than a couple of hours without that.

31:46.657 --> 31:49.575
It is a father's right.

31:51.337 --> 31:54.375
What of you, Teal'c?

32:11.778 --> 32:13.854
I am sorry, my son,

32:15.097 --> 32:17.257
that it is I who must do this to you.

32:19.298 --> 32:21.375
But I do it to save your life.

32:34.659 --> 32:36.734
Forgive me, my son.

32:38.859 --> 32:40.935
Forgive me.

32:48.619 --> 32:51.157
Do you think these things need to be fed?

32:55.819 --> 32:57.777
Go! Go!

33:12.140 --> 33:14.539
- What do we do now?
- Drop and cover your head.

33:14.540 --> 33:16.782
This is gonna be close.

33:33.141 --> 33:37.269
- Well, that was insane.
- Let's get back to the Stargate.

33:41.221 --> 33:44.340
<i>- Colonel?
- Keep coming, Captain. Almost here.</i>

33:45.182 --> 33:48.261
The Goa'uld within him is strong.
He's healing well.

33:48.262 --> 33:50.800
When will he be strong enough to travel?

33:51.583 --> 33:55.531
Soon. But by then, O'Neill,
I will no longer be.

33:59.582 --> 34:01.704
Bra'tac.

34:05.182 --> 34:07.259
I would have you hear my will.

34:10.063 --> 34:13.230
Let's just put
a little hold on that, right now.

34:14.262 --> 34:18.503
- We'd better get moving, sir.
- We've got a little problem. Um...

34:18.503 --> 34:20.663
Teal'c's kid was too sick to move,

34:20.664 --> 34:23.699
so he gave him his own Goa'uld
to keep him alive.

34:25.143 --> 34:27.896
Uh... We have one.

34:29.184 --> 34:32.967
- You what?
- We were gonna take it back, but...

34:34.344 --> 34:36.983
- We must hurry.
- In what looks like a monastery...

34:36.985 --> 34:39.503
You dare steal from
the sepulchre of the temple?

34:39.503 --> 34:43.454
- It is sacrilege.
- So what? Is it gonna help him?

34:47.784 --> 34:50.820
It is young. Not yet ready for implantation.

34:51.664 --> 34:53.739
But we will try.

35:44.987 --> 35:47.063
Go!

35:52.148 --> 35:56.559
- How are you holdin' up, Teal'c?
- My body grows strong again.

35:57.027 --> 36:00.728
- We've been discovered.
- Let's keep movin'.

36:01.588 --> 36:04.257
- Father?
- Rya'c.

36:13.588 --> 36:16.429
Your father has given you life.

36:16.429 --> 36:18.505
A Goa'uld?

36:19.148 --> 36:22.813
Your Prim'ta.
It is all I can give you until I return.

36:23.829 --> 36:26.347
Follow the guidance
of Bra'tac and your mother,

36:26.347 --> 36:28.467
and you will learn to be a great warrior.

36:28.469 --> 36:30.626
Stay.

36:30.628 --> 36:34.543
I cannot.
But the day of my return will come.

36:35.389 --> 36:37.547
When?

36:37.550 --> 36:42.710
It may be a very long time, my son.
But the life of a Jaffa is long.

36:42.949 --> 36:46.469
I know the day will come when
we will stand side by side in battle

36:46.469 --> 36:49.469
to free our people from the false gods.

36:49.909 --> 36:52.827
Remember, my son. Remember.

37:03.791 --> 37:06.282
Blame me for the priest.

37:06.471 --> 37:09.306
Tell them I tried to steal your son away.

37:09.590 --> 37:12.081
We will be all right, Teal'c. Go.

37:13.110 --> 37:16.065
My son is fortunate
to have such a mother.

37:16.391 --> 37:24.054
And his father will never return
to free his people if he does not... go now.

37:30.032 --> 37:32.440
Teal'c, we gotta move.

37:59.753 --> 38:02.552
All right. Here's the plan.

38:02.552 --> 38:04.831
- You will do as I say.
- Right.

38:04.833 --> 38:06.909
You won't need those.

38:47.474 --> 38:49.793
Behold, my friends. The traitors.

38:49.793 --> 38:52.914
Halt. Come no further.

38:53.074 --> 38:55.565
I am to present my prisoners
to Apophis himself.

38:55.835 --> 38:59.152
You cannot pass, Bra'tac.

38:59.153 --> 39:02.190
- You know of me?
- Of course, master.

39:02.755 --> 39:05.876
You were once
the greatest Jaffa warrior of all.

39:06.396 --> 39:10.474
But no one may pass
until the palace guard arrives.

39:10.476 --> 39:14.141
I understand. Then we wait.

39:41.157 --> 39:43.994
Not bad for a man of 133.

39:43.996 --> 39:46.072
Not bad at all.

39:47.115 --> 39:49.192
- Daniel?
- Yeah.

39:52.757 --> 39:57.036
What will you do? When the priests come
to, they'll tell Apophis you betrayed them.

39:57.038 --> 39:59.114
I suppose...

39:59.838 --> 40:02.458
I will cross that bridge when I come to it.

40:12.599 --> 40:15.090
I lack the words to thank you, Bra'tac.

40:15.719 --> 40:18.423
<i>I thank you, Teal'c.</i>

40:19.197 --> 40:23.195
I have another young warrior
to teach of new worlds and false gods.

40:32.518 --> 40:34.974
Farewell, my friend.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.791
Farewell.

42:22.061 --> 42:24.052
<i>Ten hut!</i>
