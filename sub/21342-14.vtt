"Asa, looking back on the show,

08:19.266 --> 08:21.567
"can you see that you may
have been a little demanding?

08:21.567 --> 08:23.166
"Just 'cause you're pregnant
doesn't mean the world

08:23.166 --> 08:25.266
has to revolve around you."

08:25.266 --> 08:28.433
Do you Shahs think that she was
asking for special treatment?

08:28.433 --> 08:30.533
- Rightfully so, yes.
She's pregnant, right,

08:30.533 --> 08:32.633
so she came to Israel
being seven months pregnant.

08:32.633 --> 08:35.233
We understood, and she was
a trouper for most of it.

08:35.233 --> 08:36.667
What upset me was
that certain people

08:36.667 --> 08:38.300
reached out from her family,

08:38.300 --> 08:40.166
saying, "Why did you
treat us a certain way?"

08:40.166 --> 08:43.266
- The thing I had a problem
with was him judging.

08:43.266 --> 08:45.433
Everybody here is
in a biracial relationship.

08:45.433 --> 08:47.533
Everybody here is with
white people, whoever.

08:47.533 --> 08:50.166
My relationship,
because he's black,

08:50.166 --> 08:52.300
required a follow-up
conversation.

08:52.300 --> 08:55.567
- Well, I want to show
the clip of Mike at dinner.

08:55.567 --> 08:57.300
- The fact that
he's not Persian

08:57.300 --> 08:59.333
and he's actually black,
that's a big deal

08:59.333 --> 09:01.567
in our culture still.
- "Actually black."

09:01.567 --> 09:03.667
- I am completely okay with
that fact-- Listen! Listen!--

09:03.667 --> 09:06.467
that someone wants to be in
an interracial relationship.

09:06.467 --> 09:11.066
This would be a perfect scenario
to sit down and talk

09:11.066 --> 09:15.066
and enlighten the world on why
Asa decided to do that,

09:15.066 --> 09:16.600
but she's decided
not to talk about it.

09:16.600 --> 09:18.300
As a matter of fact,
she's making all of us

09:18.300 --> 09:21.467
feel stupid for asking.

09:21.467 --> 09:24.433
So all I was asking was,
hey, what's happening here?

09:24.433 --> 09:25.600
You guys have been
together so long.

09:25.600 --> 09:27.467
Why aren't you getting married?

09:27.467 --> 09:30.600
And you turned that around on me
like I was the most f---ing

09:30.600 --> 09:32.300
vulgar asshole on the planet.

09:32.300 --> 09:34.133
"How dare you ask me
that question?"

09:34.133 --> 09:35.333
- You want to talk about that?
- What was the term

09:35.333 --> 09:37.333
that he used that was bad?

09:37.333 --> 09:39.066
- I used the word "black."
- How dare he bring up the fact

09:39.066 --> 09:40.500
that my man is black when we--

09:40.500 --> 09:42.500
- But why is that an insult?

09:42.500 --> 09:45.166
- Because we're not talking to
other people whose man is white.

09:45.166 --> 09:46.633
- Why don't you just
answer honestly?

09:46.633 --> 09:48.500
- I love Jermaine.
I think he's a f---ing

09:48.500 --> 09:50.734
good man. I respect him.
I shake his hand.

09:50.734 --> 09:52.600
- If you respected him,
you would not act that way.

09:52.600 --> 09:54.500
- If I see him at the gym,
he could be on the second floor,

09:54.500 --> 09:56.233
I'll walk upstairs. Ask him.

09:56.233 --> 09:58.100
I'll hug him, say what's up.
You can ask him.

09:58.100 --> 10:00.600

on social media,

10:00.600 --> 10:02.367
trying to make me look bad.

10:02.367 --> 10:04.233
- Mike, everybody
saw what they saw.

10:04.233 --> 10:06.233
I'm gonna let it be for people
to judge what you are.

10:06.233 --> 10:08.233
I'm not gonna judge you.
- No, no, no, you are a liar.

10:08.233 --> 10:10.367
You're not a person of truth.

10:10.367 --> 10:12.500
You're not the righteous person
you claim to be.

10:12.500 --> 10:14.300
- You needed the girl
to convert to your religion

10:14.300 --> 10:15.633
to even be with her,
and then you cheated on her.

10:15.633 --> 10:17.166
You don't talk
to me about that.

10:17.166 --> 10:18.600
- No, I didn't.
I--I--listen to me.

10:18.600 --> 10:20.600
You're a fake.
You're false. You're a liar.

10:20.600 --> 10:23.000
- Because my best friend is
black, and she's dark-skinned,

10:23.000 --> 10:24.533
I'm very aware of
the way that--

10:24.533 --> 10:25.667
- You're very sensitive.
You're not aware.

10:25.667 --> 10:27.400
You're hyper sensitive.

10:27.400 --> 10:28.667
- I'm not hyper sensitive.
I'm very aware.

10:28.667 --> 10:30.400
- Let me say this,
let me say this.

10:30.400 --> 10:31.767
- Every culture has
their own sensitivities,

10:31.767 --> 10:33.400
but I'm aware of
the black sensitivities,

10:33.400 --> 10:35.000
and you're not
sensitive towards it.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.467
And I think you're
a good person, Mike.

10:36.467 --> 10:38.233
I like you, and
you have a good heart.

10:38.233 --> 10:40.133
- Let me say this right now.
I apologize if the way

10:40.133 --> 10:41.667
I articulated my thought

10:41.667 --> 10:43.233

I apologize.

10:47.467 --> 10:49.266

10:49.266 --> 10:53.233
I was simply trying to use
that moment in time

10:53.233 --> 10:56.600
to have you shed a little bit
to us as your friends

10:56.600 --> 10:58.400
and show us that you are real.

10:58.400 --> 10:59.734
- Don't turn it around.
I accept your apology,

10:59.734 --> 11:01.333
but to turn it around like that.

11:01.333 --> 11:03.000
- See, you can't even
accept an apology.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.400

tell me what to do.

is a major, major problem.

proud of me if he were alive

16:34.000 --> 16:35.767
and if he would be happy for me.

16:35.767 --> 16:38.033
- There is a man that comes
through that references

16:38.033 --> 16:40.433
to being like
a grandfatherly figure.

16:40.433 --> 16:43.367
He wanted to congratulate on
a wedding and acknowledge this.

16:43.367 --> 16:48.300
- That is, you know,
something that is very special

16:48.300 --> 16:50.633
and means a lot.
- Well, I'm glad.

16:50.633 --> 16:53.700
- I lost my sh--. We went
to Israel, we went to the wall,

16:53.700 --> 16:55.433
and I've been wanting
to go there.

16:55.433 --> 16:58.633
And I literally put
my hands on the wall,

16:58.633 --> 17:02.266
and I leaned in, and I put my
face and my lips against it,

17:02.266 --> 17:06.700
and I literally felt something,
like, embrace me.

17:06.700 --> 17:10.533
And it was just crazy.
It was beautiful.

17:10.533 --> 17:13.567
Like, I felt an energy
from the wall.

17:13.567 --> 17:15.000
- You were standing there.
I saw you feel it.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
It was amazing.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.567
- I just don't think there was
any coexisting in all of Israel.

17:18.567 --> 17:20.467
- You got to be very careful
what you're saying here,

17:20.467 --> 17:23.567
because I've stuck up for you
with these statements of Israel

17:23.567 --> 17:25.734
and all that and the
breaking down the wall thing.

17:25.734 --> 17:27.333
I stuck up for you.

17:27.333 --> 17:28.467
- Yeah, that
was super offensive.

17:28.467 --> 17:30.200
- Breaking down the wall?

17:30.200 --> 17:32.200
I'm not exactly
in my own territory,

17:32.200 --> 17:34.333
and I don't feel comfortable.

17:34.333 --> 17:38.600
Just over this wall and to the
side is a temple and a mosque,

17:38.600 --> 17:43.033
so this wall sort of
seems like a blockage.

17:43.033 --> 17:46.467
It doesn't make sense. How do
I go pray to that barrier?

17:46.467 --> 17:48.734
I want to f---ing break it down.

17:48.734 --> 17:51.133
[dramatic music]

17:51.133 --> 17:52.200
I said I want to
tear down the wall

17:52.200 --> 17:54.033
because what I was told

17:54.033 --> 17:56.200
was that the Muslim side
was on the other side,

17:56.200 --> 17:58.200
and it was
a protection barrier.

17:58.200 --> 18:00.033
So I felt like
this was a barrier

18:00.033 --> 18:02.066
between the Jewish side
and the Muslim side.

18:02.066 --> 18:04.100
That was my point. Never would
I say something negative.

18:04.100 --> 18:05.767
- And that's what I articulated
to other people who were like,

18:05.767 --> 18:07.633
"She wants to break down
the holiest wall in the world."

18:07.633 --> 18:09.633
- Right, right when I stepped
in your country of Israel

18:09.633 --> 18:11.767
and they called me
jihad, right?

18:11.767 --> 18:13.500
- I didn't hear it, and
if it happened, I apologize.

18:13.500 --> 18:15.166
- They heard it. They heard it.

18:15.166 --> 18:16.500
- There's ignorant people
anywhere in the world.

18:16.500 --> 18:18.233
- He followed me
to the f---ing bathroom.

18:18.233 --> 18:20.233
- There's ignorant people
everywhere in the world,

18:20.233 --> 18:23.233
and I apologize that that--my
country is America, number one.

18:23.233 --> 18:25.333
- We're all from both
countries. It doesn't matter.

18:25.333 --> 18:27.066
- Number two,
I have pride for Israel

18:27.066 --> 18:28.633
because Israel is a country
that will take me in.

18:28.633 --> 18:30.767
If anything went wrong
in America, I can go there,

18:30.767 --> 18:32.767
and they would welcome
all of us with open arms.

18:32.767 --> 18:34.500
- They would take us too.
- So understand,

18:34.500 --> 18:36.066
when you said that about
breaking down the wall,

18:36.066 --> 18:37.600
I stuck up for you.

18:37.600 --> 18:39.233
Listen to the words that
are coming from my mouth.

18:39.233 --> 18:43.133
I stuck up for you because
I knew what you meant.

18:43.133 --> 18:44.467
- Coming up next...

18:44.467 --> 18:46.767
- I like Vida more than MJ.

18:46.767 --> 18:48.467
- What?
- That's true.

18:48.467 --> 18:49.500
- Wow.

18:52.700 --> 18:53.133
[upbeat music]

18:55.266 --> 18:57.133
- We're back with the
"Shahs of Sunset Reunion."

18:57.133 --> 19:00.400
This season, MJ worked hard
to find a healthy balance

19:00.400 --> 19:02.133
between taking care
of her father

19:02.133 --> 19:04.333
and starting a family
with Tommy.

19:04.333 --> 19:08.266
But MJ literally brought her
biggest challenge home with her

19:08.266 --> 19:11.767
as she moved into the same
building as her mom.

19:11.767 --> 19:15.333
And joining us now
to talk all about it,

19:15.333 --> 19:20.266
I'd like to welcome MJ's
mom Vida and her fiance Tommy.

19:20.266 --> 19:22.000
- Thank you very much.
- Hi, Vida.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.633
- Hello.
- Vida, you look very pretty.

19:24.633 --> 19:26.567
- Thank you so much.
- Hi, Tommy.

19:26.567 --> 19:29.667
- Hey.
- MJ, what were you smoking

19:29.667 --> 19:31.700
when you decided to move into

19:31.700 --> 19:35.100
your mother's condo complex?

19:35.100 --> 19:39.266
- So I thought that if this is
the winter of my father's life,

19:39.266 --> 19:43.700
that it would be a really good
time to be living down the hall,

19:43.700 --> 19:46.433
to be close to my dad
in a time of need.

19:46.433 --> 19:48.166
- How is your dad?

19:48.166 --> 19:50.000
- He's doing a lot better,
thank God.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.033
- MJ, we saw a lot of tears
from you this season

19:52.033 --> 19:54.133
and a lot of drinking.
- Yeah.

19:54.133 --> 19:56.266
- How much of that behavior had
to do with your dad's illness?

19:56.266 --> 19:59.633
- You know, I was in
a tailspin of fear.

19:59.633 --> 20:01.433
I was so emotional,

20:01.433 --> 20:04.567
and I needed something
to sort of take the edge off

20:04.567 --> 20:07.066
because I really
was planning to be

20:07.066 --> 20:10.200
on a completely different
life path until then.

20:10.200 --> 20:12.200
- At the painting party
at MJ's condo,

20:12.200 --> 20:14.600
the living room
turned into a war room

20:14.600 --> 20:16.333
when MJ accused Tommy

20:16.333 --> 20:19.467
of sabotaging her dreams
of becoming a parent.

20:19.467 --> 20:21.333
Watch this.

20:21.333 --> 20:22.700
- That doesn't mean that
you're gonna be a good mom!

20:22.700 --> 20:24.200
It doesn't mean
I'm gonna be a good dad!

20:24.200 --> 20:25.600
It doesn't mean
that we're ready.

20:25.600 --> 20:28.200
- Your mom died.
My dad's dying.

20:28.200 --> 20:31.400
You need to make sure that
one of us needs to not die.

20:31.400 --> 20:32.734
It's now or never!
- This is definitely--

20:32.734 --> 20:35.467
See? Now or never?
All right, babe!

20:35.467 --> 20:38.133
Did you hear one f---ing word
I just told you?

20:38.133 --> 20:42.734
- This is the biggest betrayal.
I don't want a fearful man.

20:42.734 --> 20:44.667
Sh-- or get off the pot.

20:44.667 --> 20:47.467
- Then it's never, then it's
never, then it's never!

20:47.467 --> 20:51.433
- I need somebody that's a
little bit stronger than this.

20:51.433 --> 20:54.233
Oh, boy.

20:54.233 --> 20:56.467
The words that were
coming out of my mouth,

20:56.467 --> 20:58.467
there was a panic
that had set in me

20:58.467 --> 21:00.600
that was worried
about it being too late,

21:00.600 --> 21:05.233
and when I see this,
I can see how much he loved me,

21:05.233 --> 21:08.633
how much he supported me, even
though I was so irrational.

21:08.633 --> 21:11.367
And I can apologize
and be grateful

21:11.367 --> 21:15.333
for that being shown and
thrown back at me, you know.

21:15.333 --> 21:17.500
- Tommy, why did it take you
so long to tell MJ

21:17.500 --> 21:19.367
that you weren't ready
to have kids?

21:19.367 --> 21:21.333
- 'Cause it was a real
tough year for her, man.

21:21.333 --> 21:23.066
I didn't feel like it was
the right time or place

21:23.066 --> 21:24.500
to drop something
like that on her head.

21:24.500 --> 21:26.233
- So where are you
with that right now?

21:26.233 --> 21:27.633
- I cannot wait to have a baby
with her.

21:27.633 --> 21:29.400
- Yeah, but I--
- Cannot wait.

21:29.400 --> 21:31.266
- She's done nothing--
I'm sorry, babe, but

21:31.266 --> 21:34.100
she's done nothing but
show me how much she loves me

21:34.100 --> 21:36.000
and how much she wants
to have a family.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.100
I'm so proud of her.
I'm a lucky guy.

21:38.100 --> 21:41.233
- Vida, I asked you this a year
ago, and you said no.

21:41.233 --> 21:43.500
Vida, are you excited
to be a grandma?

21:43.500 --> 21:45.667
- No.
- [laughs]

21:45.667 --> 21:47.767
- Andy, don't encourage them.

21:47.767 --> 21:50.233
[laughter]

21:50.233 --> 21:52.667
- Are you ready to be
a grandmother?

21:59.533 --> 22:02.400
- I'm not.
- You're not. Why?

22:02.400 --> 22:04.667
- First, the parents
should be ready.

22:04.667 --> 22:07.667
The grandmother and
grandfather is secondary.

22:07.667 --> 22:09.734
- Let's assume they're ready.
- Ask me.

22:09.734 --> 22:11.266
- Are you ready?
- Yes. Yes.

22:11.266 --> 22:13.266
- Are you ready?
No, not just ready,

22:13.266 --> 22:15.767
because you see
beautiful baby--anybody

22:15.767 --> 22:18.033
see beautiful baby,
she says, "I want it,"

22:18.033 --> 22:19.667
but the responsibility,

22:19.667 --> 22:22.400
24-7 responsibility.
I mean, you know it's--

22:22.400 --> 22:26.533
- It's so heartbreaking
that I'm an only child

22:26.533 --> 22:29.133
with a mother that is still,

22:29.133 --> 22:31.567
at this stage in life,
discouraging me.

22:31.567 --> 22:33.400
- Can I ask you a question?
- Ask me.

22:33.400 --> 22:35.567
- Do you think she could be
projecting anything?

22:35.567 --> 22:38.433
Maybe time-wise,
taking herself back to

22:38.433 --> 22:41.166
maybe where she was with you?

22:41.166 --> 22:44.500
- I don't want to insult her
lack of presence

22:44.500 --> 22:49.000
of where she was
when I was growing up, but...

22:49.000 --> 22:50.567
- Why, because
she was not around?

22:50.567 --> 22:52.300
- Correct.

22:52.300 --> 22:55.200
- I was there, but she chose
to stay with her dad.

22:55.200 --> 22:59.300
And I didn't just go far away
to another state or country,

22:59.300 --> 23:01.533
just 20 minutes further,
20 minutes away.

23:01.533 --> 23:04.333
- Were you ready to have a baby
when you had MJ?

23:07.333 --> 23:09.467
- I didn't plan it.

23:09.467 --> 23:13.600
- You didn't plan it.
- No, I didn't plan it.

23:13.600 --> 23:16.066
- That's real weird
of answering--

23:16.066 --> 23:18.066
- I didn't plan it.
I mean, many--

23:18.066 --> 23:20.066
- This is brutal, dude.
- That is a lot to me.

23:20.066 --> 23:22.033
- It's some cold-hearted sh--.
- That's huge.

23:22.033 --> 23:24.433
- You don't say,
I wasn't planning it--

23:24.433 --> 23:26.467
and then it happened,
and then she was born.

23:26.467 --> 23:28.467
- And it was my biggest
blessing in life.

23:28.467 --> 23:31.166
You end it with
some icing on it.

23:31.166 --> 23:33.734
- Vida, has seeing Tommy
take care of Shams

23:33.734 --> 23:36.100
changed your opinion
of him at all?

23:36.100 --> 23:37.734
- Yes, of course.

23:37.734 --> 23:39.633
Since last year, I got to--

23:39.633 --> 23:42.767
I got chance
to know him better.

23:42.767 --> 23:46.367
I start to like him.

23:46.367 --> 23:47.633
- Whoa.

23:47.633 --> 23:49.600
- You just said, "I like him."

23:49.600 --> 23:51.367
I'm assuming everyone
is shocked by this.

23:51.367 --> 23:52.633
- Uh, Yes.
- Like, I'm thinking pigs

23:52.633 --> 23:54.367
are gonna be flying outside.

23:54.367 --> 23:57.200
- He always fix
exotic food for me.

23:57.200 --> 23:59.100
- It's true.

23:59.100 --> 24:01.367
- You know, exotic food like
ribs, like duck, like scallop.

24:01.367 --> 24:03.633
- This is my world and
I'm shocked.

24:03.633 --> 24:05.600
- And he deliver it to me.
No, really.

24:05.600 --> 24:08.767
And also,
we walk our dogs together.

24:08.767 --> 24:11.033
- I like Vida more than MJ.
- What?

24:11.033 --> 24:12.367
- And she's hilarious!

24:12.367 --> 24:14.367
- Hell has officially
frozen over.

24:14.367 --> 24:16.266
- There's no funnier person
on the planet than Vida Javid.

24:16.266 --> 24:18.600
- I told Mercedes, "If you
don't marry him, I marry him."

24:18.600 --> 24:20.633
- That's true.
- Wow.

24:20.633 --> 24:23.400
- Come on, guys.
[scattered clapping]

24:23.400 --> 24:25.066
- This is so new for them.

24:25.066 --> 24:26.633
- I love you, too, Vida.

24:26.633 --> 24:28.667
- So when will the two
of you get married?

24:28.667 --> 24:30.400
- That's on her.
Whenever she wants.

24:30.400 --> 24:32.133
I'll marry her today
in front of everybody here.

24:32.133 --> 24:33.400
It doesn't change
anything for me.

24:33.400 --> 24:35.133
When she feels it's right,

24:35.133 --> 24:37.500
and her dad's
in a good place, let's rock.

24:37.500 --> 24:40.266
- Wow.
I am ordained in New York.

24:40.266 --> 24:43.367
If you guys want to come to New
York, I'd love to marry you.

24:43.367 --> 24:45.266
- Don't scare me.
- Do you want to do it?

24:45.266 --> 24:47.600
- Yeah, I'll do it.
- We'll do it. We'll do it.

24:47.600 --> 24:50.000
- Vida, before I let you go,
in your opinion,

24:50.000 --> 24:53.600
which of the Shahs
has changed for the better?

24:53.600 --> 24:58.633
- Oh, Mike. Mike has been
changed for much better.

24:58.633 --> 25:01.700
He has become more mature,
more relaxed,

25:01.700 --> 25:03.700
and for that, I like him.

25:03.700 --> 25:05.300
- [kisses]

25:05.300 --> 25:08.133
- And who for the worst?

25:08.133 --> 25:11.166
- Asa has been changed
for the worst.

25:11.166 --> 25:12.700
- Surprise, surprise.

25:12.700 --> 25:17.633
- Because Asa is very--the
most ungrateful person.

25:17.633 --> 25:20.700
- Oh, my God.
- She came to this country

25:20.700 --> 25:22.567
with one suitcase.

25:22.567 --> 25:26.700
Now she has everything, and
she owe all that to the show.

25:26.700 --> 25:30.033
And yet she said that
she's not watching the show.

25:30.033 --> 25:32.667
- You know, I haven't really
watched any of this season

25:32.667 --> 25:35.667
just 'cause I lived it.
I don't want go through it.

25:35.667 --> 25:38.133
- She said the show
makes her upset.

25:38.133 --> 25:41.166
If the cast member
express their opinion...

25:41.166 --> 25:43.433
- [yawns]
- And she doesn't like it,

25:43.433 --> 25:47.066
she calls them--
this one jealous.

25:47.066 --> 25:50.200
This one negative.
This what I have done to her.

25:50.200 --> 25:52.200
This one, why she said
that to me?

25:52.200 --> 25:55.667
Because it's all about
promoting herself.

25:55.667 --> 25:58.200
- Okay. One good and one bad.

25:58.200 --> 26:00.066
Let's take a break.

26:00.066 --> 26:03.433
Vida, it's great to see you.
Great to see you, Tommy.

26:03.433 --> 26:06.166
- So you guys like bringing Vida
out to sh-- on me every time?

26:06.166 --> 26:09.734
- No, I mean, she actually
usually sh--s on Mercedes.

26:09.734 --> 26:11.000
- She said nice things
about me.

26:13.200 --> 26:15.400
- Come on.
- Coming up next...

26:15.400 --> 26:17.200
- Annalise isn't here,
but she is ready to FaceTime

26:17.200 --> 26:19.166
in any second.

26:19.166 --> 26:21.200
- Do you want to me monogamous?
- [sighs]

26:21.200 --> 26:22.633
- Don't come at me, dude.

26:22.633 --> 26:25.367
I was sober.
You weren't, okay?

26:30.000 --> 26:30.233
[upbeat music]

26:31.767 --> 26:33.700
- Back with the Shahs reunion.

26:33.700 --> 26:36.166
Whether she was acting
as Mike's party planner

26:36.166 --> 26:38.600
or Shervin's
life coach, new girl

26:38.600 --> 26:40.500
Destiney certainly held her own

26:40.500 --> 26:43.233
when it came to not
holding back.

26:43.233 --> 26:45.500
Hey, Destiney Rose.
- Hi, Andy, joon.

26:45.500 --> 26:49.367
- You were on "People's Couch."
- Yeah.

26:49.367 --> 26:52.066
- Marriage, it is so amazing.

26:52.066 --> 26:56.233
When it's hard,
it's so f---ing hard.

26:56.233 --> 26:58.233
- What's so hard?
- You should've thought of that

26:58.233 --> 27:01.333
before you stuck your penis
in some other person's vagina.

27:01.333 --> 27:03.233
[laughter]

27:03.233 --> 27:05.266
I remember it like
it was yesterday.

27:05.266 --> 27:07.367
I was watching an episode
of the Shahs,

27:07.367 --> 27:09.266
and now I'm here today.

27:09.266 --> 27:12.266
- There you go.
- So yeah, hey.

27:12.266 --> 27:14.367
- Nicole from Atlanta
picked up on something.

27:14.367 --> 27:17.000
She said "I was almost positive
something was gonna happen

27:17.000 --> 27:19.266
between Destiney
and Mike this season."

27:19.266 --> 27:22.200
There's undeniable sexual
tension between the two of you.

27:22.200 --> 27:24.000
- Undeniable?
- What?

27:24.000 --> 27:26.467
- Is there anything
the cameras didn't catch?

27:26.467 --> 27:28.500
- Nothing. We can talk sh--
to each other.

27:28.500 --> 27:30.200
We can flirt with each other,

27:30.200 --> 27:31.500
but we both understand

27:31.500 --> 27:33.266
where we, you know, we stand.

27:33.266 --> 27:35.100
Well, obviously I can't
choose your costume,

27:35.100 --> 27:38.266
'cause if I did, I'd put you
in, like, just a dick head.

27:38.266 --> 27:39.667
- Why, you want to suck it?
- Definitely not.

27:39.667 --> 27:41.266
- That's what I thought.
- Definitely not.

27:41.266 --> 27:43.100
It's just perfect
for your demeanor.

27:43.100 --> 27:45.567
- Don't talk about dick unless
you want to play with it.

27:45.567 --> 27:48.166
- Destiney, I asked you on
"Watch What Happens Live"

27:48.166 --> 27:49.500
if you would ever date Mike,

27:49.500 --> 27:51.166
and you said no,
you'd destroy him.

27:51.166 --> 27:53.033
- I would, yeah.
- What does that mean?

27:53.033 --> 27:56.033
- It just means, like,
we're two,

27:56.033 --> 27:58.033
like, hotheaded individuals.

27:58.033 --> 28:00.500
And both of us together,
like, to mess around,

28:00.500 --> 28:03.166
it would just--it would not
be healthy for anyone.

28:03.166 --> 28:05.166
You know it as well as I do.

28:05.166 --> 28:07.500
- What do you mean, destroy me?
- It just wouldn't be good.

28:07.500 --> 28:09.033
Like, I would bite you.
- He's like,

28:09.033 --> 28:11.033
"I would destroy you."
- Eat you.

28:11.033 --> 28:14.300
I would, like, cut you up
and, like, salt, pepper, like--

28:14.300 --> 28:17.000
- Logmeh.
- Logmeh, I need--

28:17.000 --> 28:19.133
- He's getting turned on.
Be careful.

28:19.133 --> 28:21.166
- I kind of have that effect
on certain women.

28:21.166 --> 28:22.567
- Oh, God.
- Oh, God!

28:22.567 --> 28:24.033
- Where they want to cut me
into pieces

28:24.033 --> 28:26.200
and bury me
in a backyard somewhere.

28:26.200 --> 28:28.200
- You know you want me.
- Yeah.

28:28.200 --> 28:30.166
- Oh, my God.

28:30.166 --> 28:32.734
- So, Destiney, what is going
on in your love life?

28:32.734 --> 28:34.333
- I'm not dating anyone
at the moment.

28:34.333 --> 28:36.066
- What's your type?

28:36.066 --> 28:37.333
- Someone who's not,
excuse my language,

28:37.333 --> 28:40.300
a pussy but at the same token,

28:40.300 --> 28:43.467
someone who has emotions
and feelings

28:43.467 --> 28:47.166
and is in touch with who
they truly are, not some facade.

28:47.166 --> 28:49.000
- That's Shervin to a T.
- That's also Mike.

28:49.000 --> 28:53.600
- You guys, I swear, none
of your penises are for me.

28:53.600 --> 28:55.300
- Sherv-stiny,
whatever the...

28:55.300 --> 28:56.734
- Well, Shervin,

28:56.734 --> 29:00.000
your relationship
hit some major bumps.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.066
Why do you think your friends
doubted your ability

29:02.066 --> 29:04.200
to be monogamous to Annalise?

29:04.200 --> 29:07.600
- I think that we have a trend
in this group where we like

29:07.600 --> 29:09.233
to kind of stick our nose
where it doesn't belong.

29:09.233 --> 29:11.100
- Maybe it's that
they know you.

29:11.100 --> 29:12.633
- No, it's kind of hard for
some people to accept

29:12.633 --> 29:14.233
other people's situation.

29:14.233 --> 29:15.633
What nobody wants
to really understand

29:15.633 --> 29:17.300
is that she's on
another continent.

29:17.300 --> 29:18.767
She's on the other side
of the world.

29:18.767 --> 29:20.066
I can count on one hand
how many times

29:20.066 --> 29:21.567
we see each other in a year.

29:21.567 --> 29:23.633
It's an open relationship
is what it is.

29:23.633 --> 29:25.367
- Does she know
it's an open relationship?

29:25.367 --> 29:28.367
- She definitely does.
- She does?

29:28.367 --> 29:31.367
So why didn't you
explain to your friends,

29:31.367 --> 29:34.066
when they were giving you such
a hard time for being a cheater,

29:34.066 --> 29:35.633
that you were
in an open relationship?

29:35.633 --> 29:38.233
- You stood in front of us...
- Mm-hmm.

29:38.233 --> 29:40.100
- And said that you're in
a committed relationship--

29:40.100 --> 29:41.367
- Exclusive, I said.

29:41.367 --> 29:43.066
- Are you two exclusive?
- Yes.

29:43.066 --> 29:45.033
- Monogamous?
- Yeah.

29:45.033 --> 29:46.567
- Even when she's not here?
- She's not here for, like,

29:46.567 --> 29:48.233
a few weeks at a time.
It's not like that.

29:48.233 --> 29:49.433
- You've taken someone
off the market

29:49.433 --> 29:51.000
who lives on another continent.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.367
- I've gone off
the market as well.

29:52.367 --> 29:54.266
- Exclusive relationship
is not open.

29:54.266 --> 29:56.500
- And what I said
was not correct.

29:56.500 --> 29:58.266
It was a lie. I own it.

29:58.266 --> 30:00.233
Annalise didn't want me
sharing that,

30:00.233 --> 30:02.233
and out of respect
for her--she said,

30:02.233 --> 30:03.500
"Listen,
I understand the situation,

30:03.500 --> 30:05.400
"you understand the situation,

30:05.400 --> 30:07.100
"and I don't want you
tattooing it on your forehead.

30:07.100 --> 30:09.133
I don't want you going out
and advertising it."

30:09.133 --> 30:13.000
Fair enough. I did what
my girl wanted me to do.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.400
- Do you guys all believe that

30:14.400 --> 30:16.133
Shervin was
in an open relationship?

30:16.133 --> 30:18.600
- No. No.
- Hell no!

30:18.600 --> 30:20.533
- GG, did you know that he was
in an open relationship?

30:20.533 --> 30:22.400
- No. No, I did not.

30:22.400 --> 30:25.000
- Destiney, you were really
pissed at Shervin.

30:25.000 --> 30:29.066
- I was his number one fan.
I loved you, dude.

30:29.066 --> 30:32.166
I told everybody, like,
"He's so dope. He's classy.

30:32.166 --> 30:34.033
He's this. He's that."

30:34.033 --> 30:39.033
Until I asked you one question,
and I hit a nerve,

30:39.033 --> 30:41.166
and then you decided
to be big man

30:41.166 --> 30:43.266
and try to, like, come at me.

30:43.266 --> 30:46.433
- Yeah, I f---ed around before.
- Did you do it in your house

30:46.433 --> 30:48.700
where she comes to
when she comes to L.A.?

30:48.700 --> 30:50.266
- No, no.
- Yes.

30:50.266 --> 30:52.033
- I mean, let me ask you
a question.

30:52.033 --> 30:54.033
What f---ing difference
does it make where I f--- her?

30:54.033 --> 30:56.300
- Well, we're just asking.
- What difference does it make?

30:56.300 --> 30:57.633
- We're having a conversation!

30:57.633 --> 31:02.100
- On your f---ing couch,
how's that?

31:02.100 --> 31:04.300
- It was so bad
and disrespectful that this son

31:04.300 --> 31:07.266
of a bitch--excuse my language.

31:07.266 --> 31:09.166
Now you got me heated.

31:09.166 --> 31:11.567
- It was kind of a half-assed
confession, wasn't it?

31:11.567 --> 31:14.300
- I apologized, by the way.
- Hold on, let me talk.

31:14.300 --> 31:17.400
He literally looked at me,
veins out of his neck.

31:17.400 --> 31:19.700
"Who are you? You're nobody.
Who asked you?"

31:19.700 --> 31:21.600
And you felt like
you had to belittle me

31:21.600 --> 31:25.066
because you felt insecure
'cause I asked you a question.

31:25.066 --> 31:27.600
- In reality, you really didn't
clearly know what was going on.

31:27.600 --> 31:29.333
I brought my iPad because
Annalise isn't here,

31:29.333 --> 31:32.033
but she's ready to FaceTime
in any second.

31:32.033 --> 31:33.200
- Oh.
- So should we get her

31:33.200 --> 31:36.066
on the FaceTime?

31:36.066 --> 31:37.200
[line trilling]

31:37.200 --> 31:38.734
- Hey, babe.

31:38.734 --> 31:40.400
Andy wants to ask you
some questions, okay?

31:40.400 --> 31:42.200
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

31:42.200 --> 31:45.667
- So, Annalise, there's a lot
of discussion here

31:45.667 --> 31:48.300
about whether or not you

31:48.300 --> 31:53.200
and Shervin are in fact
in an open relationship.

31:53.200 --> 31:55.233
- Yes, we are.
- You are?

31:55.233 --> 31:57.467
Do you want to be monogamous?

31:57.467 --> 32:01.233
- I think it's extremely
foolish and totally asinine,

32:01.233 --> 32:05.233
while I'm here on this side
of the world and he's there,

32:05.233 --> 32:08.100
to expect him
to be monogamous to me.

32:08.100 --> 32:13.333
- Are you dating other people
in Australia?

32:13.333 --> 32:15.166
- No, I'm not.

32:15.166 --> 32:18.467
- Of course not.
- But if I wanted to, I could.

32:18.467 --> 32:20.633
- Right.
- Why did you leave?

32:20.633 --> 32:25.233
- So when MJ tells you that
he's not been faithful to you,

32:25.233 --> 32:28.066
what is your reaction to that?

32:28.066 --> 32:31.100
- You can't cheat on someone
when you are not

32:31.100 --> 32:32.500
in an exclusive relationship.

32:32.500 --> 32:34.233
- They both said
the exact same words.

32:34.233 --> 32:37.767
- We did because it's true.
- Okay, all right.

32:37.767 --> 32:40.400
Well, have a great day
in Australia.

32:40.400 --> 32:43.133
- G'day, mate.
- G'day, mate!

32:43.133 --> 32:44.266
- Thanks, babe.
- Cheerio, governor.

32:44.266 --> 32:45.467
- Call you later. Bye-bye.

32:45.467 --> 32:47.000
- Cheerio, governor.

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
- So where did MJ go?

32:50.000 --> 32:51.533
You didn't want to be
a part of that?

32:51.533 --> 32:54.734
- It was so silly.
Just so rehearsed, dude.

32:54.734 --> 32:56.266
- She's saying it's scripted.
- Okay, it's scripted.

32:56.266 --> 32:57.500
- She's saying you
fed it to her.

32:57.500 --> 32:58.633
- I'm not saying it's scripted.

32:58.633 --> 33:00.400
I'm not saying it's scripted.

33:00.400 --> 33:02.266
- You said there that
he'd been working on her.

33:02.266 --> 33:03.533
- I think it's uncomfortable
for you,

33:03.533 --> 33:05.266
and it's hard.
That's it.

33:05.266 --> 33:07.000
- It's not uncomfortable
for me.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.633
It's as uncomfortable for me
to share something

33:08.633 --> 33:10.467
that I choose not to
'cause she doesn't want me to.

33:10.467 --> 33:13.100
- It's hard to show your
real life on camera, I know.

33:13.100 --> 33:15.000
- All right, well,
thank you, Shervin.

33:15.000 --> 33:18.700
Thank you, Destiney.
We'll be right back.

33:18.700 --> 33:20.433
Coming up...

33:20.433 --> 33:23.567
- Why did you not stand up
and condemn MJ?

33:23.567 --> 33:24.700
- Okay.

33:28.567 --> 33:29.000
[dramatic music]

33:31.033 --> 33:33.567
- Back with the
"Shahs of Sunset Reunion."

33:33.567 --> 33:36.700
Another issue that caused major
tension between MJ and Asa

33:36.700 --> 33:40.633
was a certain word MJ
used over and over again

33:40.633 --> 33:42.166
throughout the season.

33:42.166 --> 33:43.567
Let's take a look.

33:43.567 --> 33:46.000
- I'm gonna get pregnant
in one month.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.166
- Why don't you work on
getting married first?

33:48.166 --> 33:49.700
- Trust me, it's not gonna
be a bastard.

33:49.700 --> 33:51.700
- Why don't we plan a wedding?

33:51.700 --> 33:54.033
- Well, I want to
get pregnant first.

33:54.033 --> 33:56.567
- You were worried about bastard
classification and now--

33:56.567 --> 33:58.166
- I'm not gonna have
a bastard child.

33:58.166 --> 34:01.500
- Okay, believe me--
- Asa will.

34:03.600 --> 34:06.033
Child out of wedlock, sorry.

34:06.033 --> 34:07.567
- Her calling your child

34:07.567 --> 34:09.300
a bastard child's
absolutely not acceptable.

34:09.300 --> 34:11.400
- She's vile. She's disgusting.

34:11.400 --> 34:14.133
- But I didn't have any venom
behind it when I said

34:14.133 --> 34:16.133
it towards myself.
- Okay.

34:16.133 --> 34:20.033
- It's very nerve-racking when
you're not an image crafter,

34:20.033 --> 34:22.200
and you actually share
the insides of your life.

34:22.200 --> 34:24.200
- Oh, let me ask you something.
- And I'm just talking.

34:24.200 --> 34:25.333
We say things.
We put in our mouth--

34:25.333 --> 34:26.734
- Can I ask you a question?

34:26.734 --> 34:29.200
What about saying
in the clip to the guys,

34:29.200 --> 34:31.467
"Asa is gonna have a bastard."

34:31.467 --> 34:33.333
- Andy, I don't expect
more from MJ.

34:33.333 --> 34:35.200
I'm talking to
Reza in specific.

34:35.200 --> 34:37.467
If there was a word for
two gay men having a baby,

34:37.467 --> 34:41.333
and it was a derogatory word,
okay, if somebody, anybody,

34:41.333 --> 34:44.333
whether I'm close to them or
not, used it, and I was there,

34:44.333 --> 34:46.233
I wouldn't just sit there,
eating my hummus.

34:46.233 --> 34:49.100
What I expected from you, Rez,
is to get up and say,

34:49.100 --> 34:50.633
"You know what,
enough is enough."

34:50.633 --> 34:52.700
She crossed the line.

34:52.700 --> 34:54.367
She was so judgmental
towards me my whole--

34:54.367 --> 34:56.500
- But he know how I meant it.
- Just be quiet.

34:56.500 --> 34:59.500
What I expected from you was to
get up and do the right thing,

34:59.500 --> 35:01.066
and you didn't.

35:01.066 --> 35:02.633
- But I can't control
what she says

35:02.633 --> 35:05.333
or how she feels
about her own process.

35:05.333 --> 35:07.700
When we were in Israel,
and she said it, I was like,

35:07.700 --> 35:11.066
"Bitch, how are you saying
this about her?"

35:11.066 --> 35:13.500
- I'm talking in that moment.
I'm talking in that moment

35:13.500 --> 35:15.333
when you guys were all
sitting there, eating.

35:15.333 --> 35:17.333
I'm talking about when it
was said in my presence.

35:17.333 --> 35:18.567
- At the Dead Sea.

35:18.567 --> 35:23.266
- She used the word
bastard child.

35:23.266 --> 35:25.133
No matter who you're
referring it to,

35:25.133 --> 35:30.133
it is probably the ugliest thing
you can say to that person.

35:30.133 --> 35:33.266
- No, but last night we were
talking about me.

35:33.266 --> 35:35.533
- This is the one thing
I wanted to talk about.

35:35.533 --> 35:38.133
When we were at the Dead Sea,
you sat there,

35:38.133 --> 35:41.133
and you told these people
something that I knew

35:41.133 --> 35:44.400
that they didn't know
that I blocked from them.

35:44.400 --> 35:46.100
- I mean, if I ask any questions
that you don't want to answer,

35:46.100 --> 35:48.667
it's okay. Just tell me,
but, what, did you take,

35:48.667 --> 35:51.133
like, hormonal therapy
to increase the chances?

35:51.133 --> 35:52.400
- I didn't.
- You just kind of--

35:52.400 --> 35:56.734
- I froze my eggs years ago.

35:56.734 --> 35:58.533
- Oh, my God.

36:01.500 --> 36:06.166
- I never said one word
to anyone for you for a year,

36:06.166 --> 36:09.033
and then you sat there
and you regurgitated part

36:09.033 --> 36:10.700
of what you had done.

36:10.700 --> 36:13.700
I'm sitting there, thinking,
Oh, my f---ing God.

36:13.700 --> 36:18.500
She just told them the one thing
she never wanted me to speak on.

36:18.500 --> 36:20.266
- You find that to be
more important

36:20.266 --> 36:21.433
than the bastard child comment?

36:21.433 --> 36:23.300
The fact that a woman had IVF?

36:23.300 --> 36:24.567
- He's talking about his
state of mind at the meal.

36:24.567 --> 36:26.433
- Asa, you're asking,
in that moment--

36:26.433 --> 36:28.233
- Rez, can I tell you,
I get what you're saying.

36:28.233 --> 36:30.033
It makes sense, but you know
what, you're very sharp.

36:30.033 --> 36:32.400
You're very smart.
You're very multifaceted.

36:32.400 --> 36:34.400
You're saying because of that,
you were so shocked

36:34.400 --> 36:36.166
and floored that
you'd rather eat hummus?

36:36.166 --> 36:38.300
- 100%!
This is what happened.

36:38.300 --> 36:42.033
I was privy to something
you had not shared

36:42.033 --> 36:43.300
with the rest of the group.

36:43.300 --> 36:45.667
Me and you were like this.

36:45.667 --> 36:48.734
You said to me,
"Don't say anything to anyone."

36:48.734 --> 36:52.200
I honored and respected
that 1,000%.

36:52.200 --> 36:54.066
I swear on my mom's life--

36:54.066 --> 36:56.066
- You didn't later, but yeah,
until then you hadn't.

36:56.066 --> 36:58.734
- I never, up until that point,
uttered one word to any of them.

36:58.734 --> 37:01.200
- That's what friends do.
- So when I sat there,

37:01.200 --> 37:06.166
and so causally, you
answered Shervin's question.

37:06.166 --> 37:07.700
- How do you know
it was casually?

37:07.700 --> 37:10.700
- Asa, you're saying to me
in that moment,

37:10.700 --> 37:13.734
"Why did you not stand up
and condemn MJ

37:13.734 --> 37:15.467
for saying bastard child?"

37:15.467 --> 37:16.734
- And what does that have
to do with that?

37:16.734 --> 37:18.333
- Because you're not
listening to me.

37:18.333 --> 37:20.333
I'm saying in that moment,
Shervin asked

37:20.333 --> 37:22.433
if you had had any help,

37:22.433 --> 37:24.600
and you decided
to share with them

37:24.600 --> 37:27.200
that you had had frozen embryos.

37:27.200 --> 37:28.600
For me, in that moment,

37:28.600 --> 37:31.233
having guarded that secret
for over a year,

37:31.233 --> 37:34.567
I was floored, and
I was thinking to myself,

37:34.567 --> 37:36.367
"Oh, my God, what else
is she gonna share?"

37:36.367 --> 37:38.100
They went to the same doctor.

37:38.100 --> 37:40.500
It was at the same time.
What's gonna come out?

37:40.500 --> 37:41.767
- Well, it wasn't
at the same time.

37:41.767 --> 37:43.233
That's all stuff that--

37:43.233 --> 37:45.066
you know, MJ--
- On my mo--Asa.

37:45.066 --> 37:46.633
- You're telling me
on your mom?

37:46.633 --> 37:48.500
Are you telling me
what I did on your mom?

37:48.500 --> 37:50.233
- Asa, you didn't tell me that
you were worried you were

37:50.233 --> 37:52.200
gonna bump into her
at Dr. Ghadir?

37:52.200 --> 37:53.500
- No, no.
- Okay.

37:53.500 --> 37:55.500
- What I said was,
it was a joke.

37:55.500 --> 37:57.633
- That's why we're at where
we are in our relationship.

37:57.633 --> 38:00.633
[dramatic music]

38:01.767 --> 38:03.367
- Coming up next...

38:03.367 --> 38:05.100
Did you go through IVF?

38:05.100 --> 38:06.233
- Not with my son.

38:06.233 --> 38:08.300
- Do you believe her?

38:15.133 --> 38:15.533
- Asa, you didn't tell me

38:15.533 --> 38:16.033
- Asa, you didn't tell me
that you were worried

38:18.233 --> 38:19.533
you were gonna bump
into her at Dr. Ghadir?

38:19.533 --> 38:21.133
- No, no.
- Okay.

38:21.133 --> 38:23.066
- What I said was,
it was a joke.

38:23.066 --> 38:26.600
- That's why we're at where
we are in our relationship.

38:26.600 --> 38:29.400
- Reza, you're known to hold
all your friends accountable

38:29.400 --> 38:31.133
and keep them honest.

38:31.133 --> 38:34.066
In this case, you helped
Asa keep her secret.

38:34.066 --> 38:36.767
Why did you choose not to
share that with anyone else,

38:36.767 --> 38:38.667
particularly MJ,
who was kind of

38:38.667 --> 38:41.500
enduring similar treatments?

38:41.500 --> 38:45.600
- So I didn't want to say
anything because

38:45.600 --> 38:47.500
Asa asked me
not to say anything,

38:47.500 --> 38:49.333
and I wanted to respect that.

38:49.333 --> 38:53.633
And MJ was talking to both of
us about her experience,

38:53.633 --> 38:55.700
and in the back of my mind,
I kept thinking,

38:55.700 --> 39:00.300
"I wish the two of them would
have an honest conversation."

39:00.300 --> 39:02.300
- Did you ever say that to Asa?

39:02.300 --> 39:05.567
Did you ever say, "Why are you
not sharing this with MJ?"

39:05.567 --> 39:08.567
- No, because she told me
she didn't want anyone to know.

39:08.567 --> 39:10.300
- Well, you also understood
my relationship

39:10.300 --> 39:12.000
with MJ wasn't really
like that.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.433
- That's not true,
because when we were

39:13.433 --> 39:15.033
actually going through it,

39:15.033 --> 39:16.700
we had a very close
relationship,

39:16.700 --> 39:20.433
such that you would call me
and ask me--

39:20.433 --> 39:23.166
like, three hour conversations
about the process.

39:23.166 --> 39:25.700
- MJ, you're
mischaracterizing it.

39:25.700 --> 39:28.433
- Maybe you felt closer to her
than she felt to you.

39:28.433 --> 39:31.166
- No, but I'm saying that we
actually had

39:31.166 --> 39:35.033
a literal exchange
where we were talking

39:35.033 --> 39:37.200
on a regular basis.
- That's not true.

39:37.200 --> 39:39.066
What happened was,
I was listening to her,

39:39.066 --> 39:41.066
and she was telling me
about the specific things,

39:41.066 --> 39:43.333
the shots in the belly, all this
stuff, and I said things like,

39:43.333 --> 39:45.300
"Why don't you have
Tommy do it?"

39:45.300 --> 39:48.066
- Knowing that

39:48.066 --> 39:51.133
you froze the embryos,
and they were all boys,

39:51.133 --> 39:56.033
and knowing that you then wound
up becoming pregnant with a boy,

39:56.033 --> 40:00.133
do you see how that might
raise questions to the group

40:00.133 --> 40:02.467
about how you became pregnant?

40:02.467 --> 40:05.200
- They could think anything.
What I didn't like is that--

40:05.200 --> 40:06.734
- Why can't you answer
the question though?

40:06.734 --> 40:08.467
- He's asking you a question.
- Yeah.

40:08.467 --> 40:11.200
- I'm asking you, do you see
how that looks to them?

40:11.200 --> 40:12.667
- Yes or no.

40:12.667 --> 40:15.500
- Sure, yeah.

40:15.500 --> 40:19.200
- Did you go through IVF?
- Not with my son.

40:19.200 --> 40:23.367
I went through IVF to have those
embryos. That's what IVF is.

40:23.367 --> 40:24.600
- Did you go through
IVF thinking

40:24.600 --> 40:26.100
that you couldn't get pregnant?

40:26.100 --> 40:27.500
- No. This is what happened.

40:27.500 --> 40:29.433
People do IVF
for different reasons.

40:29.433 --> 40:32.233
Either you're not fertile
or you're old or whatever.

40:32.233 --> 40:34.233
A lot of people use IVF...
- That's not true.

40:34.233 --> 40:36.367
- When they're not ready
to have kids yet,

40:36.367 --> 40:38.166
before--in case you can't
get pregnant later.

40:38.166 --> 40:39.633
This is what a lot of people do.
It's not some big thing.

40:39.633 --> 40:41.600
- So you did it
as an insurance policy.

40:41.600 --> 40:44.233
- Exactly. When I went through
the IVF, I told Reza.

40:44.233 --> 40:46.433
I said, "Babe, they're all
boys, and I want a girl too."

40:46.433 --> 40:48.367
He said, "Babe," he's like,
"You're young."

40:48.367 --> 40:51.500
And I said, "You know, I don't
want to go later than 40."

40:51.500 --> 40:53.367
And then he said, "This is what
you do." He's like,

40:53.367 --> 40:55.233
"You just try to naturally
get pregnant for a girl,

40:55.233 --> 40:56.633
and if you don't then
you have these."

40:56.633 --> 40:58.633
Isn't that what we talked
about? Verbatim.

40:58.633 --> 41:00.266
This is why I was so hurt

41:00.266 --> 41:02.400
that he went along
with all this craziness.

41:02.400 --> 41:05.000
This wasn't some
weird new thing.

41:05.000 --> 41:06.667
We had already discussed it.

41:06.667 --> 41:10.133
- So, Reza, did you feel guilty
for not saying anything?

41:10.133 --> 41:12.400
- Not until she said it because

41:12.400 --> 41:15.133
I just assumed that
we were keeping the secret,

41:15.133 --> 41:17.133
and that was that.

41:17.133 --> 41:20.467
- Do you understand how that
put him in a weird position?

41:20.467 --> 41:22.400
- Absolutely. Absolutely.
I get that,

41:22.400 --> 41:24.200
but like he said earlier,
there's a lot of things

41:24.200 --> 41:25.667
Reza and I
have said to each other,

41:25.667 --> 41:29.200
which, like, I thank you
for keeping private

41:29.200 --> 41:31.000
what I asked you
to keep private,

41:31.000 --> 41:32.633
but I've done the same for you,
to this day.

41:32.633 --> 41:34.133
- Of course you have.
- You have a healthy baby,

41:34.133 --> 41:35.667
and everyone's happy for you.

41:35.667 --> 41:37.266
- Thank God.
- But I am curious to hear

41:37.266 --> 41:40.700
from the group.

41:40.700 --> 41:42.033
Do you believe her?

41:42.033 --> 41:45.667
[tense music]

41:45.667 --> 41:49.033
- I do.

41:49.033 --> 41:50.433
- MJ?

41:50.433 --> 41:53.567
- Of course not.

41:53.567 --> 41:55.233
- GG?

41:55.233 --> 41:57.400
- I don't think
it happened naturally.

41:57.400 --> 42:00.567
- Honestly, I don't think
it's any of my business.

42:00.567 --> 42:05.166
But I--I think she used
one of the embryos.

42:05.166 --> 42:07.033
- Reza?
- I want Reza to answer.

42:07.033 --> 42:08.700
Do you believe me,
or do you not believe me?
