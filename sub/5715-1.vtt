02:25.011 --> 02:27.946
Can somebody
tell me what's going on?

02:28.014 --> 02:29.811
Don't be foolish, Walter.
Get him back to bed.

02:29.883 --> 02:31.510
- Bar the door.
- I'm still the master of this house.

02:31.584 --> 02:32.983
Richard, up.

02:35.688 --> 02:37.155
Who is there?

02:37.724 --> 02:38.816
Wake up, Thomas.

02:44.497 --> 02:46.021
Open the gates!

02:55.742 --> 02:57.004
Bastards.

02:57.844 --> 02:59.004
Arrow.

03:03.116 --> 03:04.515
The lantern.

03:15.228 --> 03:17.059
I see you, you little bastards.

03:17.664 --> 03:18.995
I see you!

03:31.744 --> 03:33.371
Thieving maggots.

03:33.880 --> 03:36.280
They've taken all our seed grain.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.644
What are we going to do for planting?

03:40.486 --> 03:41.578
Pray.

04:46.386 --> 04:47.853
Hello, there!

05:00.933 --> 05:03.458
- Here you go, lad.
- Thank you, Robin.

05:03.936 --> 05:05.096
Robin.

05:05.638 --> 05:07.003
The archers been called to ranks.

05:07.073 --> 05:08.973
Bloody typical. I'm starving.

05:10.376 --> 05:11.604
Hide these well.

05:11.978 --> 05:14.469
We'll have them for supper instead.

05:31.130 --> 05:32.222
Sire.

05:53.119 --> 05:55.781
For the love of Christ, Loxley,
would you stop them doing that!

05:55.855 --> 05:57.379
They love you, Sire.

05:57.457 --> 06:00.051
My head. 
It's going like the bells of hell.

06:02.995 --> 06:04.087
Is that it?

06:04.163 --> 06:08.566
One more castle to sack,
then we're home to England.

06:09.769 --> 06:11.930
Hail King Richard!

06:17.176 --> 06:18.404
Release!

06:18.811 --> 06:20.073
Push!

06:21.381 --> 06:22.746
Push!

06:23.916 --> 06:25.315
Hey, archer!

06:25.718 --> 06:26.980
Stay alive!

06:27.053 --> 06:28.247
I'll see you tonight.

06:28.554 --> 06:30.385
Don't forget your money this time, 
little man.

06:30.456 --> 06:32.481
It will be my pleasure 
to take it off you.

06:34.360 --> 06:35.452
Push!

06:40.166 --> 06:41.394
Move up!

06:46.939 --> 06:48.998
Cover the King! Cover the King!

06:52.879 --> 06:55.006
Barricades prepare!

07:03.823 --> 07:05.848
Let us put these French to bed!

07:10.296 --> 07:12.355
Raise the barricades!

07:25.411 --> 07:26.605
Jimmy.

07:27.113 --> 07:28.944
Calm and careful. Make it count.

07:29.215 --> 07:30.239
Go!

07:53.139 --> 07:54.128
Help!

07:55.808 --> 07:56.968
Cover!

08:08.788 --> 08:09.846
Now.

08:13.292 --> 08:14.316
Go!

08:23.636 --> 08:24.967
Move back!

08:26.405 --> 08:28.134
Blood for France!

08:29.942 --> 08:30.966
Go!

08:32.410 --> 08:34.311
It'll make a fine pin cushion!

08:34.380 --> 08:36.405
King Philip's arse!

08:50.596 --> 08:53.224
Look what they do for the Lion Heart!

08:53.299 --> 08:56.359
Look what they do for the Lion Heart!

08:59.272 --> 09:00.364
Push!

09:01.007 --> 09:02.338
Push!

09:02.408 --> 09:05.434
That'll burn all night, lads.
Don't let them put it out.

09:05.511 --> 09:08.969
These pricks will smash through
in the morning, take all the credit.

09:09.048 --> 09:10.572
Well done, Jimmy boy.

09:31.671 --> 09:32.899
John...

09:32.972 --> 09:34.439
Your Majesty.

09:35.074 --> 09:38.100
An English princess
shut out of her husband's bedchamber

09:38.177 --> 09:40.338
by a piece of French pastry!

09:40.413 --> 09:41.937
Aren't you ashamed?

09:42.014 --> 09:43.879
The shame is surely his.

09:43.950 --> 09:45.941
Then go in and tell him.

09:46.018 --> 09:49.647
Mewling at his keyhole
is neither one thing nor the other.

09:50.790 --> 09:51.882
John.

09:57.296 --> 09:59.059
Oh, God! What in heaven...

09:59.131 --> 10:03.465
<i>Mademoiselle, you will excuse me.
My son has need of my advice.</i>

10:03.536 --> 10:05.333
No, I don't. Ask her.

10:07.473 --> 10:09.168
Mother, please, have you no decency?

10:09.241 --> 10:13.803
I happen to be in a condition
that no mother should see her son in.

10:17.650 --> 10:20.517
- Yes, I know, but it's my mother.
- That's enough.

10:20.586 --> 10:25.285
On second thoughts, I think it better
that you do hear what I have to say.

10:25.358 --> 10:28.191
Though I will not have you in my presence.

10:28.894 --> 10:29.918
Mother.

10:29.996 --> 10:33.898
The purpose of my being in this room
is to save the realm

10:33.966 --> 10:38.062
from the consequences
of this unsuitable amusement.

10:38.137 --> 10:40.833
Her uncle is the bloody King of France.

10:42.008 --> 10:43.976
- My uncle is... 
- Get down.

10:44.710 --> 10:46.701
Her uncle wants her back.

10:47.146 --> 10:50.479
Philip wants an excuse to cross

10:52.852 --> 10:54.649
the Channel with an army.

10:54.720 --> 10:57.314
And you have given him that excuse.

10:58.290 --> 11:01.259
Take up your lawful wife and save England.

11:01.327 --> 11:04.990
My lawful wife is as barren as a brick.

11:05.331 --> 11:08.027
Is that truly the wife you want for me?

11:08.467 --> 11:09.627
Hmm?

11:09.702 --> 11:13.001
You, who honored your husband
with eight children

11:13.072 --> 11:15.632
so that even now
when death has taken the rest

11:15.708 --> 11:20.668
you have a king and the runt of the litter
to call you "Mother."

11:21.180 --> 11:23.444
Better the bastard of a servant girl

11:23.516 --> 11:26.076
than bed the niece
of England's jealous enemy.

11:26.152 --> 11:28.746
Or bed her and wed her, Mother.

11:28.821 --> 11:31.449
I've asked the Pope's men
to arrange an annulment.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.287
And do you think the Pope

11:33.359 --> 11:36.954
will favor England's royal runt
over the King of France?

11:37.029 --> 11:40.123
He might see his way
for the son of Eleanor of Aquitaine.

11:40.232 --> 11:42.632
And for the future King of England.

11:42.702 --> 11:46.502
Richard the Lion Heart is 40-years-old,
if not more.

11:47.773 --> 11:49.263
And no babies.

11:50.509 --> 11:52.568
I am a queen in the making.

11:54.847 --> 11:56.576
Yes. Yes.

11:58.250 --> 11:59.478
You see?

12:00.686 --> 12:03.018
She is my Eleanor.

12:06.258 --> 12:09.659
Now, you do understand,
this game is not about luck.

12:09.729 --> 12:12.664
It's about the science of memory
and a quick hand.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.427
ALLAN: Who'd like to take
a bit of fresh meat home?

12:14.500 --> 12:16.593
Caught this morning. We have a pheasant.

12:16.669 --> 12:19.194
Three choices. Right, left or middle?

12:19.271 --> 12:20.363
Middle.

12:20.439 --> 12:22.873
"The middle," he says. The middle.

12:22.942 --> 12:26.969
I'm sorry about those onions, young man.
You lose.

12:27.046 --> 12:28.604
Robin! Over here, 
they're needed for the pot.

12:28.681 --> 12:30.114
Feisty one!

12:31.016 --> 12:33.746
Aye, what else we got, 
what else we got?

12:33.819 --> 12:35.480
The fire will do its work.

12:35.554 --> 12:38.148
We break through at first light.

12:38.224 --> 12:41.887
With a fair wind,
we can be home in three days.

12:43.162 --> 12:44.390
You return to Nottingham?

12:45.131 --> 12:48.259
I have a wife who waits for me.

12:49.602 --> 12:52.230
I have a mother that won't die

12:52.905 --> 12:54.998
and a brother who wishes me dead.

12:55.074 --> 12:57.668
First thing I'm going 
to do is lock them up.

12:57.743 --> 13:00.439
Your people will rejoice
to see you return home.

13:00.513 --> 13:03.107
And that is a condition
I would like to keep them in.

13:03.182 --> 13:05.207
To be remembered as I was.

13:07.319 --> 13:08.411
My army knows better.

13:10.990 --> 13:13.481
Lion Heart is mangy.

13:14.126 --> 13:18.222
Every man in that army idolizes you,
Your Majesty.

13:18.297 --> 13:20.094
Don't mollycoddle me.

13:21.200 --> 13:24.761
I understand how difficult it must be
to befriend a king.

13:25.538 --> 13:29.372
Come on, Loxley.
Let us find some ruffians, drink and laugh.

13:30.309 --> 13:32.971
Let us see if we can find an honest man.

13:33.045 --> 13:34.171
Yes.

13:35.214 --> 13:36.238
Let's do that.

13:47.426 --> 13:50.224
Well, that's the thing, little man.
This is not a game of luck.

13:50.296 --> 13:53.663
It's about the science of memory
and a quick hand.

13:53.732 --> 13:57.600
I've got a quick eye. 
I'll be watching you.

14:10.049 --> 14:11.710
Three choices.

14:11.784 --> 14:14.116
Right, left, or middle.

14:15.588 --> 14:18.022
I think I'll take a fourth choice.

14:18.991 --> 14:20.982
- A fourth?
- Hmm.

14:21.060 --> 14:24.154
I've been watching you
for a while now, Longstride.

14:24.230 --> 14:26.562
There is no pea.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.998
This game is a trick!

14:30.069 --> 14:34.199
You take out the pea when you're doing
your slidings and your turnings.

14:34.273 --> 14:35.604
I got you.

14:40.779 --> 14:42.576
Don't touch it again.

14:43.482 --> 14:44.847
I'll do it!

15:05.905 --> 15:07.167
You lose.

15:26.158 --> 15:27.750
You're doing better than you think.

15:27.826 --> 15:29.589
Get in there, Robin.

15:39.004 --> 15:41.768
Kneel, you ignorant bastards!

15:41.840 --> 15:43.705
Kneel before the King!

15:46.211 --> 15:47.906
All of you, move back, now.

15:47.980 --> 15:52.076
No, no, Loxley.
These men are soldiers at play.

15:52.151 --> 15:54.346
Sinners after mine own heart.

15:55.187 --> 15:57.678
Which one of you started the fight?

15:59.992 --> 16:01.391
I did, Sire.

16:02.761 --> 16:04.820
I threw the first punch.

16:04.897 --> 16:06.262
Ah, honest man.

16:07.232 --> 16:08.529
And who're you fighting?

16:09.802 --> 16:12.635
He was fighting me, Your Majesty.

16:12.705 --> 16:14.866
I thought him to be a lesser man.

16:15.774 --> 16:17.401
He was showing me different.

16:19.111 --> 16:21.443
An enemy that shows his respect.

16:22.047 --> 16:24.345
Stand up, the pair of you.

16:24.416 --> 16:25.644
Not you.

16:30.422 --> 16:33.255
Brave and honest.

16:34.693 --> 16:39.357
Are you honest enough to tell a king
something that he does not want to hear?

16:39.732 --> 16:42.223
What is your opinion on my crusade?

16:44.570 --> 16:47.869
Will God be pleased with my sacrifice?

16:57.349 --> 16:58.816
No, he won't.

17:00.619 --> 17:02.382
Why do you say that?

17:03.222 --> 17:05.315
The massacre at Acre, Sire.

17:06.325 --> 17:07.587
Speak up!

17:09.528 --> 17:14.056
When you had us herd 2,500 Muslim men,
women, and children together,

17:14.133 --> 17:18.398
the young woman at my feet,
with her hands bound, she looked up at me.

17:19.304 --> 17:22.467
There wasn't fear in her eyes.
There wasn't anger.

17:23.409 --> 17:25.172
There was only pity.

17:27.713 --> 17:30.546
For she knew that when 
you gave the order

17:31.550 --> 17:34.644
and our blades
would descend upon their heads,

17:35.120 --> 17:37.850
that, in that moment, 
we would be godless.

17:38.657 --> 17:39.988
All of us.

17:42.361 --> 17:43.589
Godless.

17:48.233 --> 17:49.427
Honest,

17:50.736 --> 17:51.828
brave

17:53.072 --> 17:54.403
and naive.

17:56.575 --> 17:58.770
There is your Englishman.

17:59.845 --> 18:01.244
Right there.

18:03.582 --> 18:06.016
- Well done, Robin.
- You showed him.

18:06.485 --> 18:07.975
The whipping will be the worst of it.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.452
The branding iron, 
that will be the worst.

18:09.521 --> 18:10.715
Unless they hang us.

18:10.789 --> 18:13.349
No. No, this will be the worst of it.

18:13.425 --> 18:17.759
And this will be the end of it.
As soon as I get out of here, I'm gone.

18:18.397 --> 18:22.060
I don't owe God or any other man here
one more minute of service.

19:23.061 --> 19:25.894
We go all the way back to the same breast.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.429
Wet nurse.

19:29.501 --> 19:30.695
Indeed.

19:32.471 --> 19:33.631
We've been close ever since.

19:35.774 --> 19:36.900
Good.

19:39.311 --> 19:42.542
Because England, 
under your friend John,

19:44.049 --> 19:46.643
is a country with no fighting spirit.

19:47.352 --> 19:50.082
I can take London 
with an army of cooks.

19:50.923 --> 19:53.221
But Richard is on his way home.

19:53.926 --> 19:58.090
And under Richard,
England is a different animal altogether.

19:58.931 --> 20:02.332
Richard will return home
through the Forest of Broceliande.

20:03.402 --> 20:05.370
We know the exact place.

20:05.904 --> 20:11.843
He always travels ahead of his army
with only a few trusted knights around him.

20:13.145 --> 20:17.343
With Richard dead, it will be easy for you
to turn the country against John.

20:18.250 --> 20:20.480
There'll never be 
a better moment to invade.

20:25.023 --> 20:27.548
Even dying animals can be obstinate.

20:30.629 --> 20:33.564
Kill the Lion Heart
and you will be richly rewarded.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.411
Heave!

20:54.786 --> 20:55.946
Heave!

21:12.504 --> 21:13.664
Heave!

21:14.673 --> 21:16.265
For England!

21:21.013 --> 21:22.412
For England!

21:32.157 --> 21:33.818
I need a physician here!

21:33.892 --> 21:35.860
A physician! Quickly!

21:35.927 --> 21:37.622
Give us cover! Give us cover, now!

21:41.033 --> 21:42.057
Cover him!

21:43.502 --> 21:44.560
Cover the King.

21:45.370 --> 21:47.600
Physician!

21:48.640 --> 21:50.198
Why, Loxley? 
Are you not feeling well?

21:50.575 --> 21:52.372
Physician!

21:58.784 --> 21:59.876
Wine.

22:22.974 --> 22:24.373
What's this?

22:25.544 --> 22:27.705
- The King is dead!
- Dead?

22:28.513 --> 22:29.605
Dead.

22:29.981 --> 22:34.645
All right, then, Jimmy. Knock the pegs out.
We make our own fate from now on!

22:38.190 --> 22:39.555
I'll come with you.

22:39.624 --> 22:42.559
No, you're not. We don't take strays.

22:42.627 --> 22:43.651
The more the merrier.

22:43.729 --> 22:45.663
The road will be dangerous.
He might be useful.

22:45.731 --> 22:46.755
Where we going?

22:46.832 --> 22:50.461
To the coast and to a boat
before 3,000 desperate soldiers get there

22:50.535 --> 22:52.935
and the price for a Channel crossing
goes up a hundredfold.

22:53.004 --> 22:54.369
What about our wages?

22:54.439 --> 22:57.499
If you thought it was hard getting wages
while he was alive,

22:57.576 --> 22:59.441
try getting paid by a dead king.

22:59.511 --> 23:02.708
All right, boys,
collect your gear as quick as you can.

23:08.487 --> 23:10.352
I like the new church.

23:13.458 --> 23:14.789
Lady Marion.

23:14.860 --> 23:20.162
I would have been sorry to leave
without your farewell. Thank you.

23:21.233 --> 23:23.667
I'm glad to speed you on your way,
Father Tancred,

23:23.735 --> 23:27.102
but it was to seek out our new shepherd.

23:27.172 --> 23:31.632
You have lately been missed
at Sunday worship and my sermons.

23:32.444 --> 23:36.380
I like a quiet church, Father,
when I pray for a miracle.

23:43.588 --> 23:47.718
Your new flock is women,
children and old folk.

23:47.793 --> 23:49.954
Our men have gone to war
or returned broken.

23:50.395 --> 23:53.125
Their orphans run wild in the greenwood.

23:56.668 --> 23:59.967
Our fields are ready for planting
but we've no seed corn.

24:00.372 --> 24:03.170
And the church barn is full of grain.

24:03.241 --> 24:05.869
Surely, you do not expect the church

24:05.944 --> 24:08.879
to let its corn be used to plant your fields?

24:08.947 --> 24:11.745
That grain is bound for York.

24:12.951 --> 24:14.578
I am Friar Tuck.

24:15.287 --> 24:17.118
Father Tancred is elevated to York

24:17.189 --> 24:19.953
where I know he will remind the Bishop
that the people of Nottingham...

24:20.025 --> 24:23.825
The Bishop does not need reminding
that the people of Nottingham

24:23.895 --> 24:27.956
should reap what they sow
and repent of their sins.

24:28.266 --> 24:32.259
The miracle I pray for is that
the Bishop show some Christian charity.

24:36.074 --> 24:39.441
As I said, Father,
I like a quiet church when I pray.

24:56.361 --> 24:59.626
You will have trouble
from the Loxleys of Peper Harow.

25:03.401 --> 25:05.801
You keep bees, Tuck?

25:05.871 --> 25:08.066
I keep them and they keep me.

25:32.998 --> 25:34.590
Stop!

25:36.034 --> 25:37.194
Ambush!

26:54.946 --> 26:56.140
You're a knight?

26:57.082 --> 26:58.947
Where is King Richard?

26:59.618 --> 27:00.846
Oh, God.

27:01.286 --> 27:02.378
Where is the King?

27:03.555 --> 27:05.113
- Dead.
- Dead?

27:06.391 --> 27:07.585
Really?

27:09.461 --> 27:12.919
If the King's dead, 
where are you going?

27:14.499 --> 27:15.557
Deliver the crown.

27:17.435 --> 27:19.027
Richard's crown.

27:19.671 --> 27:20.729
Richard's crown.

27:24.576 --> 27:26.703
How do we assassinate a king
who's already dead?

27:35.687 --> 27:38.281
Bring back the crown!
Kill the horse!

27:41.926 --> 27:43.518
You are English.

27:44.629 --> 27:46.256
When it suits me.

27:48.166 --> 27:49.224
Who are you?

27:50.735 --> 27:52.726
Robert Loxley.

28:09.521 --> 28:11.546
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

28:13.491 --> 28:15.459
That's the King's horse.

28:20.532 --> 28:22.466
Jimmy! Move!

28:32.944 --> 28:34.070
Jimmy!

28:47.092 --> 28:48.650
Robin, they're French.

28:48.727 --> 28:49.921
Ambush.

29:08.480 --> 29:09.572
Go.

29:47.485 --> 29:48.577
John.

29:49.954 --> 29:51.080
Don't know.

29:51.256 --> 29:52.587
He's dead.

29:52.791 --> 29:53.883
Help.

30:02.634 --> 30:03.896
My sword.

30:14.212 --> 30:16.203
Its value to me is great.

30:17.482 --> 30:19.450
It belonged to my father,

30:20.718 --> 30:21.878
Sir Walter Loxley

30:23.121 --> 30:24.611
of Nottingham.

30:26.624 --> 30:27.955
Do you know it?

30:28.026 --> 30:30.790
Aye, I've heard of Nottingham.

30:34.432 --> 30:35.899
Then the fate...

30:35.967 --> 30:38.094
The fates have smiled on me.

30:41.372 --> 30:45.866
You must take the sword to my father.

30:47.078 --> 30:48.978
It will bring me peace.

30:52.350 --> 30:55.945
I took it in anger and without his consent.

30:57.388 --> 31:00.516
You must understand the bond of love

31:00.592 --> 31:02.787
between a father and his son.

31:03.261 --> 31:07.254
My father abandoned me to the world of men
when I was six years old.

31:07.332 --> 31:09.960
I know little of the love
between father and son.

31:10.635 --> 31:11.966
I beg you.

31:12.403 --> 31:14.064
Longstride,

31:14.138 --> 31:15.605
say you will.

31:20.645 --> 31:21.839
I will.

31:42.600 --> 31:44.727
It's a pact sworn in blood, Robin.

31:45.003 --> 31:48.598
It's a scratch, Allan, 
and that's all it is.

32:08.893 --> 32:10.053
Robin!

32:17.101 --> 32:20.264
Loxley was making for the coast
to meet the ship.

32:24.275 --> 32:25.902
That crown could be our passage home.

32:26.344 --> 32:27.834
We're common archers, Robin.

32:27.912 --> 32:30.779
If we arrive at the King's ship
with his crown, we'll be accused of murder.

32:31.182 --> 32:33.082
How do you know

32:33.151 --> 32:37.349
that the knights you see walking about
are actually knights at all?

32:37.422 --> 32:39.913
There is no difference between a knight

32:39.991 --> 32:43.051
and any other man
aside from what he wears.

32:44.162 --> 32:46.130
All we need is about us.

32:46.831 --> 32:49.994
Armor, helmets, swords,

32:51.936 --> 32:55.428
and we make England wealthy men

32:57.008 --> 32:59.272
with horses and gold.

33:00.178 --> 33:03.409
Fate has smiled upon us at last.

33:04.349 --> 33:07.113
And I, for one, 
shall not turn my back on her.

33:09.320 --> 33:11.811
Take that crown off your head, Will,

33:11.889 --> 33:12.981
and fill it to the brim.

33:18.129 --> 33:20.427
We commit the soul of this boy
to your keeping, Lord.

33:20.498 --> 33:24.093
We would ask, when he arrives
at the gates of eternity,

33:24.168 --> 33:25.726
if you could let him in.

33:39.617 --> 33:43.781
Goliath's got the soil turning nicely.
But for what?

33:44.422 --> 33:47.084
- Nettles?
- Nettle soup and dandelion salad,

33:47.158 --> 33:48.216
that'll keep us alive.

33:48.292 --> 33:49.384
Come, Goliath. This way.

33:49.460 --> 33:51.087
Until we get a miracle.

33:51.863 --> 33:53.125
This way.

34:00.204 --> 34:01.865
Marion, Sheriff.

34:08.913 --> 34:13.350
Marion, I've been at Peper Harow,
waiting in vain

34:13.684 --> 34:15.879
for Sir Walter to receive me.

34:17.755 --> 34:20.815
Kindly tell him I have better things to do
than haunt his threshold.

34:20.891 --> 34:23.588
That you have,
while robbers are roaming free in Sherwood.

34:23.661 --> 34:25.925
That's sheriff's business.
Why don't you look to it?

34:25.996 --> 34:28.226
Tell the old fool that next time,
I'll break his door down.

34:28.466 --> 34:32.027
- And if he's too proud to pay...
- No, no, no, no. He's not too proud.

34:32.103 --> 34:33.627
He's too poor.

34:33.704 --> 34:36.070
In the name of King Richard,
you have stripped our wealth

34:36.139 --> 34:37.539
to pay for foreign adventures.

34:37.875 --> 34:40.342
Whilst at home, the Church,
in the name of the merciful God,

34:40.411 --> 34:44.848
has reaped, without mercy, the largest share
of what we had set aside to feed ourselves.

34:45.850 --> 34:48.444
Between a sheriff and a bishop,
I wouldn't care to judge

34:48.518 --> 34:50.748
who's the greater curse
on honest English folk.

34:52.690 --> 34:54.123
Marion,

34:54.192 --> 34:57.218
why, oh, why do you make an enemy of me

34:57.295 --> 34:59.456
when you have the means
to make me your protector?

34:59.831 --> 35:01.230
What means?

35:06.370 --> 35:07.803
If you leave now,

35:07.972 --> 35:10.406
I will lengthen your life
by not telling my husband

35:10.475 --> 35:13.035
of your visit when he returns home.

35:13.111 --> 35:16.012
Your husband? After 10 years?

35:17.815 --> 35:21.581
If he's not dead, he's rutting his way
through the brothels of the Barbary Coast.

35:21.886 --> 35:24.116
So speaks a man of experience.

35:24.188 --> 35:26.019
Well, think on it, Marion.

35:26.524 --> 35:28.992
Sir Walter is dying without an heir.

35:29.060 --> 35:33.019
Peper Harow will fall to the crown,
and you will be living in the hedgerow.

35:33.331 --> 35:35.060
You'll be glad to come to me then.

36:09.300 --> 36:10.927
Captain, there.

36:30.221 --> 36:34.021
Sir, we were told
to expect 12 riders and the King.

36:35.026 --> 36:37.017
Our beloved King is dead.

36:39.096 --> 36:40.427
Long live the King.

36:40.498 --> 36:42.227
Long live the King.

36:42.700 --> 36:43.860
And you are, sir?

36:45.536 --> 36:49.973
Sir Robert Loxley of Nottingham. And you?

36:50.575 --> 36:52.566
I'm the King's equerry, Sir.

36:52.643 --> 36:56.044
Come aboard, gentlemen,
before the tide floats her. It's coming in fast.

37:45.162 --> 37:47.096
So what's the plan in the morning?

37:48.299 --> 37:51.359
The boat stops at Gravesend
on the way to London.

37:51.435 --> 37:54.893
We'll leave the honor of returning
the crown to them, and we'll be gone.

37:55.306 --> 37:56.466
Where?

37:57.341 --> 37:58.535
North.

37:59.944 --> 38:02.139
Well, that suits me.

39:19.090 --> 39:22.218
Make ready, Sir Robert.
We dock in 20 minutes.

39:22.860 --> 39:23.918
Gravesend?

39:23.994 --> 39:27.430
No, My Lord.
The palace docks, Tower of London.

39:36.807 --> 39:37.899
Will.

39:39.410 --> 39:40.707
John. Allan.

39:42.380 --> 39:44.575
- Where are we?
- London.

39:44.849 --> 39:46.248
Holy Christ!

39:47.818 --> 39:49.683
We dock in 10 minutes.

39:50.254 --> 39:52.313
When this is done, be ready to ride.

39:52.390 --> 39:54.324
What if... What if Loxley is known

39:54.392 --> 39:56.485
to the King's mother or brother
or any of them?

39:56.560 --> 39:58.551
Then we'll be riding for our lives.

39:58.629 --> 40:02.065
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
Peter and Paul and Mary!

40:02.133 --> 40:03.623
I knew it! I knew it!

40:05.569 --> 40:06.763
Good morning, My Lord.

40:06.837 --> 40:10.295
Some words of advice
on this tragic occasion.

40:10.975 --> 40:13.637
You appreciate
everything must be done correctly,

40:14.445 --> 40:16.811
so you will present the crown
to Lady Eleanor.

40:16.881 --> 40:18.439
You will go down on the right knee.

40:18.516 --> 40:22.384
Do not look in her eyes
when you tell her the King is no more.

40:22.453 --> 40:26.253
And do not rise until all others rise.
Do you understand?

40:26.323 --> 40:27.415
Yes.

40:39.170 --> 40:40.330
Agnes.

40:41.539 --> 40:43.166
My blue and gold brocade.

40:43.240 --> 40:44.366
Yes, My Lady.

41:06.230 --> 41:08.027
Part for the Queen.

41:08.098 --> 41:09.463
Part for the Queen.

41:34.458 --> 41:35.618
Cease.

41:57.414 --> 41:59.006
What's this? What's happening?

41:59.083 --> 42:01.278
King Richard returns from France, My Lord.

42:06.056 --> 42:07.921
Did Loxley deceive us?

42:43.093 --> 42:44.185
Kneel.

42:50.801 --> 42:52.462
Long life, my son.

42:54.071 --> 42:55.333
Rise now.

42:58.275 --> 43:01.005
A king is dead.

43:02.079 --> 43:04.547
Long live the King.

43:06.183 --> 43:08.208
Long live the King!

43:08.852 --> 43:10.820
- Long live the King!
- Long live the King!

43:11.255 --> 43:12.984
- Long live the King!
- Long live the King!

43:13.724 --> 43:14.816
Rise.

43:19.997 --> 43:21.157
You...

43:22.800 --> 43:24.427
I don't know you.

43:25.102 --> 43:27.730
Robert Loxley, Sire, of Nottingham.

43:28.772 --> 43:30.239
Welcome then.

43:31.141 --> 43:33.234
And how did my brother die?

43:34.578 --> 43:36.739
In battle, Your Majesty, as was his way.

43:38.048 --> 43:39.447
As was his way.

43:40.250 --> 43:41.410
You deserve a reward...

43:41.485 --> 43:42.543
Let's get the horses.

43:42.620 --> 43:44.110
For bringing home the news.

43:46.323 --> 43:47.483
Kneel.

43:54.665 --> 43:56.394
Did you say you were from Nottingham?

43:57.835 --> 43:58.927
Yes.

44:01.572 --> 44:03.733
Your father, Sir Walter,

44:05.209 --> 44:07.074
owes tax to the crown.

44:10.381 --> 44:11.609
My crown.

44:11.682 --> 44:14.048
Tell him it's bloody expensive
running a country

44:14.118 --> 44:16.052
and everyone's got to pay their way.

44:16.620 --> 44:17.985
We'll start with this.

44:20.190 --> 44:22.055
MAN: Make way for the King!

44:22.726 --> 44:23.715
Make way!

44:23.794 --> 44:24.988
Your Majesty.

44:25.062 --> 44:26.927
MAN: Make way for the King!

44:32.403 --> 44:34.132
- Make way!
- Godfrey.

44:35.039 --> 44:37.701
Godfrey, my friend. It's so good to see you.

44:38.275 --> 44:40.209
- How were your travels?
- Good, Sire.

44:41.412 --> 44:42.572
What happened to your face?

44:43.814 --> 44:45.543
A hunting accident. It's nothing.

44:46.950 --> 44:48.645
- Frightening.
- Your Majesty.

44:48.719 --> 44:52.211
Call it a dueling scar.
The ladies will love you all the more.

44:53.057 --> 44:55.218
I bow to your knowledge of the ladies, Sire.

44:59.630 --> 45:01.359
You can get up now.

45:09.873 --> 45:11.238
Sir Robert.

45:15.679 --> 45:19.137
You will know of me, perhaps.
I'm William Marshal.

45:20.417 --> 45:23.250
Your father and 
I were young men together.

45:23.654 --> 45:27.522
Tell him I'm coming to visit him soon,
on spring's first black night.

45:29.660 --> 45:31.560
I may have need of him.

45:31.929 --> 45:33.794
I will. I'll tell him.

45:36.500 --> 45:39.936
Whoever he is and whatever he is,
he knows too much.

45:42.906 --> 45:44.430
Get rid of him.

45:57.621 --> 45:59.486
Come on, let's follow.

47:02.686 --> 47:04.381
Forfeit what you got.

47:04.454 --> 47:07.514
Victuals, coin, clothing

47:07.624 --> 47:09.091
or your life.

47:10.994 --> 47:13.554
Thomas Cooper.

47:14.331 --> 47:15.730
Is that you?

47:20.037 --> 47:21.834
Are you sick, Thomas?

47:22.673 --> 47:24.197
We're all sick.

47:25.309 --> 47:28.176
- Where are the rest of you?
- Don't... Don't tell her.

47:28.245 --> 47:29.678
Loop will be angry.

47:29.746 --> 47:31.611
No, it's your mother
who's going to be angry.

47:31.682 --> 47:35.709
Now, either you come with me,
or I come with you.

47:35.786 --> 47:37.151
You choose.

47:38.388 --> 47:40.879
Well, come on then. Where are they?

47:42.159 --> 47:43.490
Answer me.

48:32.309 --> 48:34.937
Four men, five horses, one gray.

48:35.379 --> 48:37.609
- Have you seen them?
- That way.

49:02.105 --> 49:05.506
By Christ! Can you not sing a happy tune?

49:06.009 --> 49:11.572
Sing a foot-stomper about adventure
and daring and courage.

49:11.648 --> 49:15.140
No. Sing something about a woman.

49:16.219 --> 49:17.846
A large woman.

49:24.995 --> 49:27.589
Right. I'm done. The money's divided.

49:28.465 --> 49:29.898
And so should we be.

49:30.434 --> 49:31.458
Where will you go?

49:34.371 --> 49:37.363
I think something is owed
for this good fortune,

49:37.441 --> 49:38.931
and I mean to pay it back.

49:39.009 --> 49:40.203
How so?

49:41.645 --> 49:44.842
The inscription on the sword,
it taunts my memory.

49:45.716 --> 49:48.651
Maybe it's just my imagination, 
I don't know.

49:49.119 --> 49:52.213
But I intend to take that sword
back to its owner

49:52.289 --> 49:54.018
and fulfill the request of his dying son.

49:54.091 --> 49:55.285
Are you mad?

49:55.826 --> 49:57.885
You just said we were in danger, Robin.

49:57.961 --> 50:00.896
Now you choose to step back
in to harm's way?

50:01.732 --> 50:03.927
They're bound to go there and find you.

50:04.001 --> 50:08.062
We can't repay our good luck
with bad grace. It invites darkness.

50:13.076 --> 50:14.771
- I'm going with you.
- And I, Robin.

50:15.212 --> 50:16.474
- Yes.
- No.

50:17.781 --> 50:19.840
Tonight is our last in company.

50:19.916 --> 50:22.885
Tomorrow, we go our separate ways.

50:24.588 --> 50:27.421
Pack up your share. We eat and sleep.

50:28.125 --> 50:30.525
Will, you're on first watch.

51:32.722 --> 51:33.746
Will.

52:04.154 --> 52:05.746
Watch your step!

52:06.690 --> 52:07.748
One of them got away.

52:09.292 --> 52:11.817
Bastards! They've stolen my fortune.

52:13.296 --> 52:15.594
Richard's army is coming home.

52:15.665 --> 52:18.862
It costs money to keep it together.
Marshal, you speak for the money.

52:18.935 --> 52:20.095
I do, Sire.

52:20.170 --> 52:23.628
But to disband the army
could cost more than to keep it.

52:26.943 --> 52:31.277
King Richard's campaigns were costly.
And the expected returns...

52:31.348 --> 52:33.612
What is that to me, Marshal?

52:34.384 --> 52:36.875
My brother's troubles are over!

52:38.121 --> 52:39.748
They're over!

52:41.992 --> 52:43.084
Clear the room.

52:55.205 --> 52:57.799
So... Taxation.

52:57.874 --> 52:59.068
Taxation?

52:59.142 --> 53:03.511
Milking a dry udder gets you nothing
but kicked off the milking stool.

53:03.847 --> 53:05.712
Mother, spare me your farmyard memories.

53:05.782 --> 53:08.444
You have none,
and I don't understand them.

53:08.518 --> 53:10.281
These are difficult times.

53:10.554 --> 53:12.215
We can buy time.

53:12.289 --> 53:14.951
I can send envoys to secure loans.

53:15.091 --> 53:18.117
There are money chests from Sicily
to Normandy if you know where to look.

53:18.361 --> 53:20.056
Cap-in-hand to moneylenders?

53:20.597 --> 53:21.962
Your master's a king.

53:22.666 --> 53:24.998
The crown is owed money at home.

53:25.068 --> 53:29.300
The northern barons plead poverty,
but that's always been the song of rich men.

53:30.340 --> 53:32.205
So, what's to be done?

53:48.024 --> 53:51.050
Give me leave, Sire, to go north
with a company of mounted men.

53:51.528 --> 53:54.019
I'll have the merchants and landowners
fill your coffers

53:54.431 --> 53:56.058
or their coffins.

53:56.132 --> 53:58.532
Englishmen killing Englishmen.

53:58.602 --> 54:01.662
No man loyal to the crown
has anything to fear.

54:02.239 --> 54:07.233
And loyalty means paying your share
in the defense of the realm.

54:08.445 --> 54:09.969
That's well said.

54:10.981 --> 54:12.676
Hmm? Don't you think, Marshal?

54:14.050 --> 54:15.210
Mother?

54:15.285 --> 54:20.382
Richard commanded loyalty
not by threats but by example.

54:20.590 --> 54:23.650
Mother, your sainted son was an imbecile.

54:24.027 --> 54:29.090
And you supported his every folly
from here to Jerusalem and back.

54:29.766 --> 54:32.894
Yes, you worshipped him

54:32.969 --> 54:36.871
when the warrior lost territories
hard won by his father.

54:37.073 --> 54:39.166
You kissed his picture

54:39.242 --> 54:42.507
while England had to pay
four years' revenue

54:42.579 --> 54:44.274
to ransom him when he was captured.

54:44.347 --> 54:46.838
You are just as much to blame as anyone

54:46.916 --> 54:49.646
for the wreckage which is my inheritance.

55:03.300 --> 55:06.030
I broke her skin more than she did mine.

55:13.576 --> 55:14.941
Chancellor.

55:21.184 --> 55:22.412
Marshal,

55:24.187 --> 55:27.816
you served my brother faithfully
and my father before him.

55:29.392 --> 55:32.259
I think you've spent enough time
with my family

55:32.362 --> 55:34.922
and, no doubt,
would like to spend more with your own.

55:36.900 --> 55:39.300
Therefore, and with regret,

55:39.903 --> 55:43.270
I accept your resignation
of all your offices and matters of state.

55:46.676 --> 55:47.938
The ring.

55:55.985 --> 55:57.452
Your Majesty.

56:16.573 --> 56:20.236
Choose carefully, Godfrey, the spot
where you would place your dagger.

56:29.152 --> 56:31.677
For I will choose carefully, as well.

56:54.978 --> 56:56.502
MAN: Open the gates!

57:32.615 --> 57:33.980
Nottingham.

57:35.251 --> 57:38.049
- Is this your people, Robin?
- I don't know. Might be.

57:38.488 --> 57:41.889
They don't look much,
these Middle Englanders.

57:41.958 --> 57:44.620
Well, they've been keeping your lot
in place easy enough, haven't they?

57:44.694 --> 57:47.527
I hear that you Welsh boys,
you live on leeks.

57:47.931 --> 57:49.899
You co-habit with sheep.

57:52.469 --> 57:54.334
Bloody Scottish mule.

57:55.905 --> 57:59.363
You wouldn't want to annoy a bee hive
with your noise, would you?

57:59.442 --> 58:01.376
Your swords would be
no good then, gentlemen.

58:01.644 --> 58:02.736
You're the town beekeeper?

58:03.947 --> 58:06.814
Bless you, no. I'm the friar. 
Tuck's the name.

58:07.383 --> 58:10.819
Well, Friar Tuck, can you tell me
where I might find Sir Walter Loxley?

58:11.588 --> 58:13.351
If he's not up at Peper Harow...

58:15.959 --> 58:17.221
How long will your business take?

58:22.332 --> 58:23.356
Stay safe.

58:24.100 --> 58:25.362
God be with you all.

58:32.575 --> 58:33.701
That's it?

58:33.776 --> 58:35.209
After 10 years?

58:36.746 --> 58:39.715
Good Friar, where can a man get, well,

58:39.782 --> 58:41.841
moderately insensible
on a drink around here?

58:42.218 --> 58:45.381
Allan, he's a man of the cloth.
I'm sorry, Friar.

58:46.689 --> 58:48.884
- Have you coin?
- I have coin.

58:49.592 --> 58:50.991
Two pieces.

58:51.794 --> 58:52.886
Each.

58:54.063 --> 58:56.998
Have you tried the honey liquor
we call mead?

58:59.035 --> 59:00.502
Come with me.

59:01.170 --> 59:03.400
Gives a man a halo, does mead.

59:35.104 --> 59:36.162
Girl.

59:36.239 --> 59:38.230
Girl?

59:42.779 --> 59:45.646
Either you're going blind
or you're looking for charity.

59:46.115 --> 59:48.106
Are you the keeper of this house?

59:48.184 --> 59:50.379
In a manner of speaking, yes.

59:50.787 --> 59:52.584
I wish to see Sir Walter Loxley.

59:54.958 --> 59:56.084
And you are?

59:56.426 --> 59:57.688
Robin Longstride.

59:57.760 --> 59:59.728
Plain Robin Longstride? No Sir?

01:00:00.229 --> 01:00:02.288
No, ma'am. No Sir.

01:00:06.035 --> 01:00:07.400
Are you here about the tax?

01:00:08.304 --> 01:00:12.638
No, I'm here to bring him his sword.
His son's dead.

01:00:14.877 --> 01:00:16.139
This way.

01:00:38.067 --> 01:00:39.932
He'll take your horse.

01:00:51.848 --> 01:00:53.042
Marion!

01:00:53.783 --> 01:00:54.977
Marion!

01:00:55.251 --> 01:00:57.446
Maggie, where is she?

01:00:58.688 --> 01:01:00.246
Ma'am, Sir Walter calls for you.

01:01:00.323 --> 01:01:02.723
I know, Margaret. I can hear him.

01:01:03.259 --> 01:01:05.250
Tell him we have a guest.

01:01:14.604 --> 01:01:18.040
I'm Marion Loxley. Robert's wife.

01:01:22.311 --> 01:01:25.303
My Lady, I owe you an apology.
If I'd have known...

01:01:25.381 --> 01:01:28.646
Bad news is bad news
no matter how it comes.

01:01:29.952 --> 01:01:34.389
Indeed, I owe you thanks for taking the time
to deliver it here yourself.

01:01:35.191 --> 01:01:37.682
Did you fight alongside my husband?

01:01:39.362 --> 01:01:40.420
Yes.

01:01:41.831 --> 01:01:43.025
Did he die well?

01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:48.601
In an ambush, ma'am.

01:01:48.871 --> 01:01:52.204
He was the man chosen
to bring home Richard's crown.

01:01:52.442 --> 01:01:54.501
Marion, who is here?

01:01:55.878 --> 01:01:57.607
A traveler, Walter.

01:02:03.186 --> 01:02:05.654
This news will go very hard on him.

01:02:05.722 --> 01:02:06.814
Bring him in.

01:02:06.889 --> 01:02:08.151
Yes, yes.

01:02:08.691 --> 01:02:11.888
Tell him Robert is in the Holy Land,
sends his love and will return soon.

01:02:12.762 --> 01:02:15.356
Marion, our traveler will be thirsty.

01:02:15.965 --> 01:02:19.492
Travelers are always thirsty.
Is that not so?

01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:20.695
Your name, sir?

01:02:21.771 --> 01:02:23.898
Longstride. Robin Longstride.

01:02:26.542 --> 01:02:27.668
Do you mock me?

01:02:29.545 --> 01:02:30.569
Sir?

01:02:31.881 --> 01:02:33.143
Your son,

01:02:34.917 --> 01:02:36.714
he asked me to bring you this.

01:02:45.328 --> 01:02:49.697
And how does Robert defend himself
if he has no sword?

01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:54.201
The prodigal son will not return after all.

01:02:56.873 --> 01:03:01.037
So, no tears,
no forgiveness from his father.

01:03:05.281 --> 01:03:07.078
No amends to be made.

01:03:15.658 --> 01:03:17.421
Did you see him die?

01:03:19.762 --> 01:03:21.992
I was with him when he passed.

01:03:23.032 --> 01:03:26.001
His final words were for the love
and bond between a father and son.

01:03:27.136 --> 01:03:28.569
Forgive my rudeness.

01:03:30.139 --> 01:03:32.835
My grief has been waiting for this day.

01:03:34.043 --> 01:03:37.035
So come, so that I may see you.

01:03:52.495 --> 01:03:54.520
Robin Longstride.

01:03:55.765 --> 01:03:59.098
A common enough but noble Saxon name.

01:04:01.404 --> 01:04:04.373
So, you will dine with us.

01:04:05.775 --> 01:04:08.266
But first, you must bathe, sir.

01:04:08.711 --> 01:04:09.803
You stink.

01:04:16.719 --> 01:04:22.021
I've laid out some of my husband's clothes.
I hope you don't find that too discomforting.

01:04:23.392 --> 01:04:24.654
My Lady,

01:04:27.096 --> 01:04:28.757
I'll need some help with the chain mail.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.262
Winifred.

01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:35.132
Winifred.

01:04:43.713 --> 01:04:47.240
The coif has a clasp at the nape of the neck.

01:04:56.692 --> 01:05:00.685
If you take off the coif,
you'll find lacings in the back of the tabard.

01:05:37.366 --> 01:05:38.799
Thank you.

01:05:38.868 --> 01:05:40.631
I'll have it washed.

01:05:58.054 --> 01:05:59.715
Marion, more wine.

01:06:04.593 --> 01:06:07.619
You've taken a long road to bring this to me.

01:06:07.730 --> 01:06:11.131
I cannot decide
whether that makes you trustworthy...

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:12.792
Or manipulative.

01:06:13.269 --> 01:06:18.468
Marion, I'm merely trying to gauge the
quality of the man we have as our guest.

01:06:18.908 --> 01:06:20.432
Is he handsome?

01:06:20.977 --> 01:06:22.069
Yes.

01:06:23.879 --> 01:06:27.838
In the way that yeomen sometimes are
when they are sober.

01:06:27.917 --> 01:06:30.818
Entertain us
with a tale of your life, sir.

01:06:31.454 --> 01:06:34.184
We don't get many visitors anymore.

01:06:34.256 --> 01:06:36.986
Except tax collectors and other beggars.

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:41.059
I don't know where I'm from.
Only know where I've been.

01:06:41.130 --> 01:06:44.497
So, Marion,
what color are his eyes?

01:06:49.605 --> 01:06:51.232
I don't yet know.

01:06:52.008 --> 01:06:56.604
I have a proposal for you, young man.

01:06:58.247 --> 01:07:01.273
You brought me this sword,
which has great meaning.

01:07:01.484 --> 01:07:03.315
If you give me your time,

01:07:04.387 --> 01:07:05.718
it is yours.

01:07:07.390 --> 01:07:10.553
I could stay for a day, or more.

01:07:13.262 --> 01:07:16.891
- I have a question to ask you.
- And what is your question?

01:07:16.966 --> 01:07:19.958
The words on the hilt of the sword,
what do they mean?

01:07:20.936 --> 01:07:25.839
Well, I think I have much to tell you
about history. About your history.

01:07:32.982 --> 01:07:34.347
That's very kind.

01:07:34.417 --> 01:07:37.580
Well, you haven't heard the other half
of my proposal yet.

01:07:37.653 --> 01:07:41.680
I want you to stay in Nottingham
and, for the time being,

01:07:41.757 --> 01:07:45.853
become my returned son,
and therefore Marion's spouse.

01:07:45.961 --> 01:07:47.189
Oh, that's enough!

01:07:47.263 --> 01:07:48.855
- You've had too much to drink.
- Listen. Listen. Listen.

01:07:48.931 --> 01:07:53.231
We both know that without a husband
you will lose this land when I die.

01:07:53.602 --> 01:07:55.797
Do you dispute that? Hmm?

01:07:55.871 --> 01:07:58.601
- No.
- No, so if I say this is my son,

01:07:58.674 --> 01:08:04.340
he will be seen as that.
And, so, as your husband. Huh?

01:08:04.413 --> 01:08:06.142
It is a fair contract.

01:08:06.382 --> 01:08:10.443
It is not as if I expect you
to have children or...

01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:15.350
No, the sword for your time, Longstride.

01:08:15.825 --> 01:08:17.087
Are you in agreement?

01:08:18.694 --> 01:08:21.527
- Yes.
- Marion, go tell the staff

01:08:21.831 --> 01:08:26.029
that my son has arrived
and our home is now whole again.

01:08:27.036 --> 01:08:29.800
Tell them to ring the church bells
in celebration.

01:08:30.639 --> 01:08:32.504
And more wine, please.

01:08:59.535 --> 01:09:00.866
Home brew.

01:09:02.203 --> 01:09:06.607
If I wasn't the village priest,
I'd try for the village drunkard.

01:09:08.810 --> 01:09:09.868
Oh, great.

01:09:10.946 --> 01:09:13.380
A man could get
very affectionate here.

01:09:13.448 --> 01:09:18.910
I haven't seen so many women
for so few men outside a nunnery.

01:09:19.654 --> 01:09:24.115
The secret to success
is never go for the prettiest one.

01:09:24.926 --> 01:09:27.087
Start with the homely one on the left.

01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:32.294
Right there.

01:09:32.667 --> 01:09:35.761
She's about my size.
I'm going to make her smile.

01:09:36.738 --> 01:09:39.139
I'm going to make you smile!

01:09:39.642 --> 01:09:40.700
Come over here!

01:09:40.876 --> 01:09:43.777
So, why do they call you Little John?

01:09:43.845 --> 01:09:45.176
What are you trying to get at?

01:09:46.215 --> 01:09:47.408
I'm proportionate.

01:10:43.405 --> 01:10:44.633
Stop it.

01:10:48.043 --> 01:10:49.408
What did I tell you?

01:10:59.288 --> 01:11:01.813
It seems we are to share my chamber.

01:11:02.791 --> 01:11:05.658
A ruse to convince the servants.

01:11:06.495 --> 01:11:09.521
Well, if the aim is deception,

01:11:10.099 --> 01:11:15.469
should you not be addressing me as
"My husband," or, "My dear"?

01:11:16.205 --> 01:11:18.673
Don't be ridiculous.

01:11:22.778 --> 01:11:24.905
Well, are you coming or not?

01:11:28.817 --> 01:11:30.045
Ask me nicely.

01:11:38.027 --> 01:11:41.793
Please, dear husband,
will you share my chamber?

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:19.658
Here.

01:12:23.672 --> 01:12:25.435
I sleep with a dagger.

01:12:25.507 --> 01:12:29.443
If you so much as move to touch me,
I will sever your manhood.

01:12:29.511 --> 01:12:30.773
You understand?

01:12:31.113 --> 01:12:32.171
Thanks for the warning.

01:12:39.088 --> 01:12:40.350
Hello, dogs.

01:14:36.104 --> 01:14:37.332
Godfrey.

01:14:47.916 --> 01:14:49.645
Where are your men?

01:14:50.652 --> 01:14:51.880
They're dead, My Lord.

01:14:53.021 --> 01:14:54.147
And Loxley?

01:14:54.423 --> 01:14:55.583
Alive.

01:14:59.261 --> 01:15:00.660
Then fate has left him to me.

01:15:12.975 --> 01:15:17.002
I hear a man's steps. 
Good morning, my son.

01:15:17.813 --> 01:15:19.280
Morning, Walter.

01:15:20.449 --> 01:15:21.541
Father.

01:15:21.917 --> 01:15:23.145
Father.

01:15:23.886 --> 01:15:26.252
So what is it that 
you know of my history?

01:15:26.321 --> 01:15:27.618
Patience.

01:15:28.056 --> 01:15:31.719
You must show yourself today.
Wear your sword.

01:15:33.262 --> 01:15:34.251
Marion.

01:15:35.264 --> 01:15:36.492
I'm here, Walter.

01:15:36.565 --> 01:15:40.558
Reacquaint your husband
with his village and his people.

01:15:42.437 --> 01:15:44.735
I'll see to the horses.

01:15:45.007 --> 01:15:46.531
I feel invigorated.

01:15:46.708 --> 01:15:50.109
I woke this morning 
with a tumescent glow.

01:15:50.779 --> 01:15:51.973
Eighty-four.

01:15:52.781 --> 01:15:54.146
A miracle.

01:15:55.751 --> 01:15:59.346
I've always wondered
at the private conversations of men.

01:16:00.155 --> 01:16:01.452
Husband.

01:16:21.810 --> 01:16:23.641
This is rich country.

01:16:24.246 --> 01:16:26.214
Where's your cattle and your sheep?

01:16:26.281 --> 01:16:30.240
Sold, eaten, stolen, traded.
We've had seven lean years.

01:16:30.786 --> 01:16:33.152
Our meat now is rabbit

01:16:33.221 --> 01:16:35.917
or wild pig on a lucky day.

01:16:35.991 --> 01:16:37.288
And deer?

01:16:37.626 --> 01:16:41.528
If you're willing to risk your neck
to the King's executioner.

01:16:41.897 --> 01:16:44.559
Every deer in the land
belongs to His Majesty.

01:16:44.633 --> 01:16:47.397
These things are God's gifts first
before the King's possessions.

01:16:48.036 --> 01:16:51.836
If it's illegal for a man 
to fend for himself

01:16:51.907 --> 01:16:53.807
how then can he be a man 
in his own right?

01:16:53.875 --> 01:16:55.740
Welcome home, sir.

01:16:55.811 --> 01:16:59.008
Sir Robert.
Good morning, Joseph. Emma.

01:17:00.582 --> 01:17:04.541
Sir Walter is our Lord, and you
are Robert returned and you should act so.

01:17:07.255 --> 01:17:09.553
Sir Robert. You remember me?

01:17:09.625 --> 01:17:12.150
Tom Chamberlain. Pig farmer.

01:17:12.494 --> 01:17:14.018
You don't look a day older, Tom.

01:17:15.030 --> 01:17:16.395
Sir Robert.

01:17:17.032 --> 01:17:19.330
When will our young lads 
come back to us?

01:17:19.901 --> 01:17:22.836
Will you find my Jamie,
tell him to come home?

01:17:25.607 --> 01:17:29.441
With no work and little food,
the village boys have gone.

01:17:29.511 --> 01:17:31.911
- To be soldiers?
- Poachers.

01:17:37.285 --> 01:17:38.718
Look at that, mate.

01:17:41.757 --> 01:17:43.452
Still here then?

01:17:45.427 --> 01:17:49.523
For the time being, refer to me as Sir Robert.
I'll explain later.

01:17:49.931 --> 01:17:53.765
My men-at-arms.
This is about as courtly as they get.

01:17:54.202 --> 01:17:57.603
Allan A'Dayle, 
Will Scarlet and Little John.

01:17:57.673 --> 01:17:58.799
Lady Marion.

01:18:05.614 --> 01:18:08.640
I trust you had an historic evening.

01:18:09.184 --> 01:18:10.344
For sure.

01:18:14.923 --> 01:18:18.188
Lady Marion Loxley. My wife.

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:20.427
Well played.

01:18:20.962 --> 01:18:24.295
A bit rash but well played nonetheless.

01:18:24.366 --> 01:18:25.958
Right you are, Robin.

01:18:26.168 --> 01:18:27.465
Sir Robert.

01:18:27.536 --> 01:18:29.128
- Sir Robert.
- Sir...

01:18:29.738 --> 01:18:31.535
- Sir.
- Sir.

01:18:31.606 --> 01:18:33.267
- Sir Bob.
- Sir Robert.

01:18:40.582 --> 01:18:41.844
Friar.

01:18:43.418 --> 01:18:48.082
Ah, Marion. Good news travels
from Peper Harow this morning.

01:18:48.890 --> 01:18:51.381
Sir Robert, nice to see you again.

01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:55.157
You should've made yourself known
when we met in the field. Welcome home.

01:18:55.864 --> 01:18:58.526
Yes, I should've. 
Forgive me, Friar.

01:18:59.768 --> 01:19:01.235
What happens here?

01:19:01.303 --> 01:19:03.771
We're moving
the Church's grain to York.

01:19:03.839 --> 01:19:05.602
Politics out of London, 
I hear.

01:19:05.674 --> 01:19:08.643
This is our grain. 
It belongs in this soil.

01:19:08.710 --> 01:19:11.736
Lady Marion, I but follow the orders
of my superiors

01:19:11.813 --> 01:19:14.213
and abide by their saying and rule.

01:19:19.254 --> 01:19:21.745
Does His Holiness
know about your wealth of honey?

01:19:23.692 --> 01:19:27.924
There are wolves in York, Sir Robert.
Voracious wolves.

01:19:29.331 --> 01:19:31.026
The bees are my family.

01:19:31.466 --> 01:19:33.627
I'm a procreator by design.

01:19:34.336 --> 01:19:37.100
I'm not a churchy friar. 
Never was.

01:19:37.939 --> 01:19:39.702
My bees give life.

01:19:40.408 --> 01:19:42.171
They are my life, Sir Robert.

01:19:42.244 --> 01:19:44.144
Should not the Bishop be told

01:19:44.279 --> 01:19:47.407
so the clergy can spread
Nottingham honey on Nottingham bread?

01:19:50.719 --> 01:19:53.620
What if the grain were not to reach York?

01:19:55.056 --> 01:19:58.423
Then the bees need not be spoken of.

01:20:07.536 --> 01:20:10.767
I was an old maid
when Robert courted me.

01:20:10.839 --> 01:20:15.208
I was a daughter of a respectable widow
with a thimbleful of noble blood.

01:20:15.644 --> 01:20:19.375
We were wed, and then a week later

01:20:19.781 --> 01:20:23.547
he left to join ship
for France and the Holy Lands.

01:20:23.618 --> 01:20:26.644
And that was my married life to a man

01:20:28.657 --> 01:20:30.352
I hardly knew.

01:20:33.395 --> 01:20:35.829
- A good knight.
- Short, but sweet.

01:20:36.898 --> 01:20:40.026
I mean, he was a good knight.

01:20:40.602 --> 01:20:42.593
A good knight-at-arms, a soldier.

01:20:42.671 --> 01:20:45.003
Oh, yes,
my knight-in-arms, even so.

01:20:45.073 --> 01:20:46.836
And I in his.

01:21:17.706 --> 01:21:20.140
Stop! You'll break its neck.

01:21:33.221 --> 01:21:34.449
Marion.

01:21:43.531 --> 01:21:44.657
Easy.

01:21:48.403 --> 01:21:49.597
I'm all right.

01:21:51.973 --> 01:21:53.770
I can't move me legs.

01:21:54.809 --> 01:21:56.174
I can't move me legs.

01:21:58.580 --> 01:21:59.808
Thank you.

01:22:03.051 --> 01:22:04.382
My Lord?

01:22:17.399 --> 01:22:19.196
Oh, is it my turn now?

01:22:28.410 --> 01:22:29.570
Thank you.

01:22:31.546 --> 01:22:34.071
Nicely done, sir.

01:22:34.149 --> 01:22:38.984
And to see Lady Marion Loxley's legs,
beyond my wildest hopes this morning.

01:22:41.189 --> 01:22:45.148
I don't believe you know my husband,

01:22:45.627 --> 01:22:46.685
Sir Robert.

01:22:46.761 --> 01:22:50.356
Allow me to introduce
the Sheriff of Nottingham.

01:22:50.432 --> 01:22:52.161
Welcome home, Sir Robert.

01:22:52.233 --> 01:22:56.101
You make your mark quickly
by rescuing the King's ram from drowning.

01:22:56.604 --> 01:22:57.662
What's this?

01:22:57.739 --> 01:23:01.971
What's mine in coin I have the right
to take in goods or livestock.

01:23:03.178 --> 01:23:04.975
If it's God's will.

01:23:08.583 --> 01:23:11.074
Here's a ram's worth of tax
for the Exchequer.

01:23:11.152 --> 01:23:15.612
Your insolence to Lady Marion,
I'll consider a debt between us.

01:23:41.616 --> 01:23:43.880
Mead and grain alcohol?

01:23:43.952 --> 01:23:46.250
I thought as much.

01:23:49.357 --> 01:23:51.552
There's something that we need to do.

01:23:51.626 --> 01:23:53.389
At your service.

01:24:05.907 --> 01:24:07.135
All right, lads.

01:24:07.208 --> 01:24:11.508
Should've left while you had the chance.
Something's afoot. Off we go.

01:24:27.128 --> 01:24:29.255
Stop. Stop the horses.

01:24:30.985 --> 01:24:34.648
You there! Move aside!
We're on Church business!

01:24:35.656 --> 01:24:37.591
None shall pass

01:24:37.659 --> 01:24:40.287
unless they can answer the riddle.

01:24:40.696 --> 01:24:42.527
Moon-mad!

01:24:42.597 --> 01:24:46.226
And what is the riddle, 
you insolent wretch?

01:24:47.035 --> 01:24:51.564
What has 18 legs and 
isn't going anywhere?

01:24:54.610 --> 01:24:56.942
Your next move will be your last.

01:24:58.181 --> 01:24:59.443
Evening, friend.

01:25:01.484 --> 01:25:03.919
I demand to know who you are.

01:25:04.388 --> 01:25:05.582
We are men of the hood.

01:25:08.192 --> 01:25:09.750
Merry now, at your expense.

01:25:11.195 --> 01:25:12.526
"The Lord taketh..."

01:25:12.596 --> 01:25:13.996
And we shall giveth back.

01:25:14.065 --> 01:25:16.590
My advice is to plant it now, by moonlight.

01:25:16.935 --> 01:25:17.993
Why is that, good friar?

01:25:18.069 --> 01:25:21.163
When it sprouts,
I can claim it as a miracle from God.

01:25:21.239 --> 01:25:24.265
The Church in York
would never deny a miracle.

01:25:28.447 --> 01:25:31.177
How much further?
GUARD: About 11 miles.

01:26:21.571 --> 01:26:23.596
I thought you had left.

01:26:24.641 --> 01:26:26.802
The fields have been planted.

01:26:27.611 --> 01:26:29.636
I didn't want to wake you.

01:26:30.214 --> 01:26:31.875
How did you find the seed?

01:26:32.583 --> 01:26:34.949
If you have to ask, it's not a gift.

01:26:37.054 --> 01:26:38.521
Thank you.

01:27:24.172 --> 01:27:25.503
Pikemen, at the ready!

01:27:25.573 --> 01:27:26.938
Arms to ready!

01:27:27.508 --> 01:27:28.999
Prepare!

01:27:29.812 --> 01:27:32.303
This King John is no king of mine!

01:27:33.883 --> 01:27:36.716
You! Are you Baldwin? Open these gates!

01:27:36.785 --> 01:27:38.548
In whose name do you come against us?

01:27:38.621 --> 01:27:40.646
In the name of King John.

01:27:41.057 --> 01:27:43.617
Pay or burn.

01:27:43.693 --> 01:27:47.185
We have paid in money
and men for King Richard's wars!

01:27:47.397 --> 01:27:49.524
And we have no more to give!

01:27:49.666 --> 01:27:51.497
- Burn it.
- Archers!

01:28:11.556 --> 01:28:12.784
Come on.

01:28:24.804 --> 01:28:26.601
My Lord, this way!

01:28:30.911 --> 01:28:32.936
<i>In the name of John,</i>

01:28:33.013 --> 01:28:36.176
<i>by the Grace of God, King of England,</i>

01:28:36.250 --> 01:28:41.779
<i>let it be known to all who abide here
that a tax is warranted!</i>

01:28:47.495 --> 01:28:50.760
<i>Those persons
refusing to abide by the law</i>

01:28:50.832 --> 01:28:54.290
<i>will hereby be subject
to severe punishment.</i>

01:28:59.175 --> 01:29:02.167
<i>By order of His Majesty, King John.</i>

01:29:13.690 --> 01:29:15.021
Father Tancred!

01:29:32.678 --> 01:29:34.009
Your Majesty.

01:29:37.383 --> 01:29:38.941
Your Majesty.

01:29:41.887 --> 01:29:44.618
I have lost the
confidence of King John,

01:29:45.058 --> 01:29:46.855
but he may still listen to you.

01:29:46.926 --> 01:29:49.394
Allow me to know better, William.

01:29:49.629 --> 01:29:51.961
You are much wiser than your owl.

01:29:52.032 --> 01:29:55.160
I dare say. I've lived longer.

01:29:56.504 --> 01:29:58.233
Edward, take him.

01:29:58.305 --> 01:29:59.363
Your Majesty.

01:30:02.877 --> 01:30:06.210
John is no Richard, alas,
Your Majesty.

01:30:08.350 --> 01:30:13.014
But I serve the throne,
and the throne will endure.

01:30:15.724 --> 01:30:18.693
Speak plainly, Marshal.
What's troubling you?

01:30:19.428 --> 01:30:21.420
The crown is in peril.

01:30:22.632 --> 01:30:25.897
Godfrey has been plotting
with Philip of France.

01:30:26.936 --> 01:30:28.961
French troops have already landed
on our shores,

01:30:29.038 --> 01:30:31.768
and they are murdering Englishmen
in the name of King John.

01:30:32.642 --> 01:30:36.636
The northern barons
will make civil war against the throne.

01:30:36.914 --> 01:30:40.247
Leaving our coast defenseless
against the invasion

01:30:40.951 --> 01:30:42.976
which is certainly coming.

01:30:45.423 --> 01:30:50.417
So it's left to John's mother to scold him
like a child and point him to his duty.

01:30:56.234 --> 01:31:00.797
My son has an enemy in his court
closer to him than any friend.

01:31:00.906 --> 01:31:04.467
An English traitor. A paid agent of France.

01:31:05.644 --> 01:31:08.670
Why are you telling me
when you must tell the King?

01:31:08.747 --> 01:31:10.181
Isabella!

01:31:11.251 --> 01:31:13.481
It is you who must do that.

01:31:14.054 --> 01:31:18.184
Tell King John that you've had word
from France, from Philip himself, if you like.

01:31:18.258 --> 01:31:21.421
Why not tell him the truth?
That William Marshal...

01:31:21.495 --> 01:31:26.195
Oh! A mother he mistrusts
bearing the word of a man in dishonor?

01:31:26.267 --> 01:31:27.393
No.

01:31:28.302 --> 01:31:32.671
If you wish to be queen,
you must save John.

01:31:34.209 --> 01:31:35.642
And England.

01:31:37.112 --> 01:31:38.306
No!

01:31:39.181 --> 01:31:40.978
No! No!

01:31:43.919 --> 01:31:46.855
Godfrey! The bloody Judas!

01:31:47.624 --> 01:31:50.218
By the bowels of Christ, it's a lie.

01:31:50.293 --> 01:31:52.124
You lie!

01:32:10.849 --> 01:32:13.010
I'm sorry, my love.

01:32:29.001 --> 01:32:30.992
- Sheriff.
- Up there.

01:32:34.907 --> 01:32:38.105
Man won't give his name.
Demands audience with the sheriff.

01:32:38.645 --> 01:32:40.010
Demands?

01:32:42.916 --> 01:32:45.009
- Go away.
- My Lord.

01:33:07.209 --> 01:33:09.837
Tax collections proceed apace.

01:33:10.813 --> 01:33:12.611
Nottingham's turn is coming.

01:33:12.949 --> 01:33:14.917
Good. Good.

01:33:15.118 --> 01:33:18.884
Tell Sir Godfrey
that the Sheriff of Nottingham is his man.

01:33:18.955 --> 01:33:21.685
May he put his stamp on my authority.

01:33:21.758 --> 01:33:26.526
I see trouble
coming from Loxley of Peper Harow.

01:33:27.131 --> 01:33:28.962
A blind old man gives you trouble?

01:33:29.033 --> 01:33:31.194
Aye, and his son will give more.

01:33:31.369 --> 01:33:35.601
The crusader, Robert Loxley,
has returned this past week.

01:34:13.180 --> 01:34:14.375
Marion.

01:35:18.118 --> 01:35:20.211
Go on! Go on.

01:35:25.692 --> 01:35:27.251
Has he spoken yet?

01:35:27.495 --> 01:35:28.621
He was spying, Loop.

01:35:29.096 --> 01:35:30.495
Spying?

01:35:32.032 --> 01:35:34.500
Robert, I'm ashamed of you.

01:35:34.935 --> 01:35:36.266
Hello, Marion.

01:35:36.704 --> 01:35:38.137
I've come to save you.

01:35:39.408 --> 01:35:40.534
Know him?

01:35:41.209 --> 01:35:45.839
Boys, this is Sir Robert Loxley, my husband.

01:35:46.281 --> 01:35:49.409
Sir Robert, the runaways of Sherwood.

01:35:50.385 --> 01:35:51.717
Untie him.

01:35:51.788 --> 01:35:55.588
No, I don't think spies should be let off
so easily.

01:35:56.192 --> 01:35:57.557
That was unkind.

01:35:57.627 --> 01:35:59.424
You were a crusader?

01:35:59.562 --> 01:36:00.620
Yes.

01:36:00.696 --> 01:36:03.665
Did you hear that, boys?
You bested a crusader.

01:36:05.068 --> 01:36:07.332
- My men are good fighters.
- I don't know about that.

01:36:07.404 --> 01:36:09.838
I think the weight of numbers
might have been in their favor.

01:36:09.907 --> 01:36:12.637
But they do move silently
like the creatures of the forest.

01:36:12.709 --> 01:36:14.836
But that's only a skill if you stay as a man.

01:36:14.912 --> 01:36:17.006
You don't become the creatures you hunt.

01:36:17.081 --> 01:36:19.413
- We're soldiers.
- No, you're not.

01:36:19.584 --> 01:36:22.610
Soldiers fight for a cause. What's yours?

01:36:24.856 --> 01:36:27.825
You don't have one.
That makes you poachers.

01:36:29.161 --> 01:36:32.528
Common thieves with a lot to learn.

01:36:32.598 --> 01:36:33.690
Like what?

01:36:33.766 --> 01:36:36.030
I could teach you how to tie knots.

01:36:36.101 --> 01:36:39.002
I could teach you which wood to get
to make your bows stronger.

01:36:39.071 --> 01:36:43.304
I could teach you how to make arrows
that fly more than 20 feet.

01:36:43.743 --> 01:36:47.076
And I can help Marion to teach you
how to stay clean

01:36:47.214 --> 01:36:49.182
so you won't get sick.

01:36:49.649 --> 01:36:54.280
I don't know who you're fighting, son,
but it's not me. I'm not your enemy.

01:36:55.189 --> 01:36:58.283
If you want to chat,
you know where to find me.

01:37:12.541 --> 01:37:13.667
Wife?

01:37:21.317 --> 01:37:22.807
Marshal.

01:37:23.386 --> 01:37:25.752
Stand aside!
Make way for the King!

01:37:25.822 --> 01:37:27.346
Your Majesty.

01:37:29.158 --> 01:37:32.094
What the devil are you doing here? Hmm?

01:37:32.162 --> 01:37:33.254
Sire?

01:37:33.330 --> 01:37:36.197
Will you keep that animal still?
What's it got, palsy?

01:37:38.702 --> 01:37:40.795
Do you think I haven't noticed
how you've deserted me?

01:37:40.871 --> 01:37:43.306
If Your Majesty recalls,
our last conversation...

01:37:43.375 --> 01:37:44.774
At our last conversation,

01:37:44.843 --> 01:37:48.142
Philip of France wasn't coming our way
with an invasion fleet.

01:37:48.780 --> 01:37:50.543
Was he, Marshal?

01:37:54.287 --> 01:37:56.152
My friend Godfrey

01:37:57.056 --> 01:37:59.889
is not the friend 
I thought he was.

01:38:00.693 --> 01:38:03.423
He's stirred up
the northern barons against me.

01:38:03.996 --> 01:38:06.328
They come south with an army.

01:38:07.968 --> 01:38:10.402
Marshal, how dare they? 
How dare they?

01:38:10.470 --> 01:38:13.303
Sire, forgotten men are dangerous men.

01:38:15.509 --> 01:38:18.069
<i>The barons need to be told</i>

01:38:18.645 --> 01:38:22.082
<i>that when the French come,
we are all Englishmen.</i>

01:38:23.151 --> 01:38:25.415
- Fitzrobert.
- Baldwin.

01:38:26.487 --> 01:38:29.786
We'll make an army of the north
and march on London.

01:38:30.391 --> 01:38:32.519
The barons need leadership.

01:38:32.828 --> 01:38:36.730
Wiser kings know
they must let men look them in the eye,

01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:39.500
hear their voice.

01:38:40.169 --> 01:38:43.731
Together, let us ride north to meet them.

01:38:46.543 --> 01:38:49.137
They march against their king, Marshal.

01:38:51.481 --> 01:38:52.971
Their king.

01:38:54.451 --> 01:38:58.445
We will meet them with the pikes
of our militia in their gizzards.

01:38:59.123 --> 01:39:01.387
You have lost your touch, Marshal.

01:39:03.628 --> 01:39:06.028
Perhaps we'll look to the barons
without you.

01:39:17.209 --> 01:39:20.373
Saddle up with a spare horse.
I leave immediately.

01:39:20.446 --> 01:39:21.970
I want to know where to find Godfrey.

01:39:22.048 --> 01:39:23.379
My Lord.

01:39:38.532 --> 01:39:41.126
- I found him, My Lord.
- Where?

01:39:41.201 --> 01:39:45.468
Nottingham. In plain sight,
living as Walter Loxley's son.

01:39:51.379 --> 01:39:53.404
Then we go to Nottingham.

01:39:53.915 --> 01:39:56.942
Take no prisoners.
Leave no stone un-scorched.

01:40:00.389 --> 01:40:02.220
Take two men, four horses.

01:40:02.291 --> 01:40:06.523
Ride hard for the coast, then on to Paris
and give a message to the King.

01:40:24.282 --> 01:40:26.580
I'll make the place famous.

01:40:30.088 --> 01:40:31.578
Come, Allan!

01:40:31.656 --> 01:40:34.785
I'll get them drinking. 
You get them dancing!

01:40:34.893 --> 01:40:35.951
All right.

01:41:06.961 --> 01:41:12.059
Music, laughter,
the crackle of a bonfire and a roasting pig.

01:41:12.367 --> 01:41:15.894
Life has returned.
You have returned it, Robin.

01:43:16.134 --> 01:43:18.102
How did you know it was me?

01:43:18.169 --> 01:43:21.764
Who else would sit by me uninvited

01:43:22.574 --> 01:43:25.168
like a friend from the old days?

01:43:25.745 --> 01:43:27.406
How are you, William?

01:43:28.214 --> 01:43:31.047
I'm well and troubled.

01:43:31.117 --> 01:43:33.608
Ah. And what brings you?

01:43:33.886 --> 01:43:36.753
I'm riding on to Barnsdale tonight.

01:43:36.923 --> 01:43:41.156
I've heard something of the barons' anger
against the crown's tax collector...

01:43:41.228 --> 01:43:43.628
The anger has turned into action.

01:43:43.797 --> 01:43:45.856
They assemble to march against the King.

01:43:46.199 --> 01:43:48.565
You think you can persuade the barons
to turn back?

01:43:48.635 --> 01:43:49.727
Turn back, no.

01:43:50.939 --> 01:43:54.875
To join King John against a French invasion.

01:43:56.077 --> 01:43:58.170
- A what?
- Help me, Walter.

01:43:58.546 --> 01:44:00.480
I cannot go with you.

01:44:01.449 --> 01:44:03.179
I cannot speak for this king.

01:44:03.252 --> 01:44:04.844
He is the only king we have.

01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:06.319
But not the only hope.

01:44:07.423 --> 01:44:08.583
Explain.

01:44:10.159 --> 01:44:12.389
- Marion.
- I'm here, Walter.

01:44:12.728 --> 01:44:14.993
This is my old friend,
William Marshal.

01:44:15.065 --> 01:44:17.556
Lady Marion Loxley, my son's wife.

01:44:17.634 --> 01:44:20.501
Lady, I was glad to see Sir Robert
when he disembarked in London.

01:44:20.570 --> 01:44:23.061
I think you know better, Marshal.

01:44:23.139 --> 01:44:27.907
Sir William, I know, would like
to meet Robin Longstride again.

01:44:39.091 --> 01:44:40.524
We've met before.

01:44:40.592 --> 01:44:42.992
Yes, Sir, I know. In London.

01:44:44.830 --> 01:44:47.230
No, when you were a child.

01:44:49.101 --> 01:44:50.728
Hobby-horse age.

01:44:51.504 --> 01:44:55.406
Sir Walter and I returned from the Holy Land
to fetch you home.

01:44:55.942 --> 01:44:57.204
But you'd gone.

01:44:57.276 --> 01:45:00.404
We had lost Thomas Longstride's son.

01:45:02.949 --> 01:45:06.511
It was a wound that never healed.

01:45:13.460 --> 01:45:16.453
You need to know what I know.

01:45:17.465 --> 01:45:20.400
Your father was a stonemason.

01:45:21.603 --> 01:45:23.594
Is that pleasing to you?

01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:27.968
Yes. It is.

01:45:28.711 --> 01:45:31.874
But he was more than that.
He was a visionary.

01:45:32.648 --> 01:45:34.309
What did he see?

01:45:34.884 --> 01:45:37.546
That kings have a need of their subjects

01:45:37.620 --> 01:45:41.489
no less than their subjects
have need of kings.

01:45:41.558 --> 01:45:43.219
A dangerous idea.

01:45:43.794 --> 01:45:47.059
Your father was a philosopher.
He had a way of speaking

01:45:47.130 --> 01:45:50.258
that took you by the ears and by the heart.

01:45:50.700 --> 01:45:53.568
None of these things
can be written down, Robin.

01:45:53.638 --> 01:45:56.402
You must commit them to your very soul.

01:45:57.141 --> 01:45:59.006
This is the science of memory.

01:45:59.477 --> 01:46:04.882
"Rise and rise again
until lambs become lions."

01:46:07.319 --> 01:46:12.552
Finally, hundreds listened,
thousands, who took up his call

01:46:12.791 --> 01:46:16.056
<i>for the rights of all 
ranks from baron to serf.</i>

01:46:19.032 --> 01:46:20.693
"Rise and rise again

01:46:22.936 --> 01:46:25.166
"until lambs become lions."

01:46:30.277 --> 01:46:32.108
What happened to him?

01:46:32.947 --> 01:46:34.642
Close your eyes.

01:46:40.855 --> 01:46:45.088
<i> ... foundation is set on
the rights of liberty for all people!</i>

01:46:49.731 --> 01:46:53.132
Longstride, give up the charter
and their names!

01:46:53.368 --> 01:46:54.893
<i>You were there.</i>

01:46:55.204 --> 01:46:56.466
You saw it.

01:46:59.709 --> 01:47:01.142
I will not.

01:47:25.336 --> 01:47:26.701
Not dead.

01:47:28.173 --> 01:47:29.470
Not now.

01:47:32.344 --> 01:47:33.572
Not now.

01:47:37.950 --> 01:47:41.647
Here is my copy
of the main contract.

01:47:42.054 --> 01:47:45.582
This charter of rights
was written by your father.

01:47:45.659 --> 01:47:49.686
And here are... There are the names
of all the barons that signed the charter.

01:47:49.763 --> 01:47:53.164
Fitzrobert, Baldwin, Marshal and myself.

01:47:53.700 --> 01:47:57.000
What he wanted
was a charter for every man...

01:47:57.071 --> 01:47:59.631
- Wait there.
- To have the same rights.

01:47:59.707 --> 01:48:02.835
Sir Walter? A messenger for you.

01:48:02.910 --> 01:48:04.434
Bring him in.

01:48:05.146 --> 01:48:06.875
Step forward, sir.

01:48:07.950 --> 01:48:10.441
- My Lord.
- I'm listening.

01:48:10.586 --> 01:48:12.850
Peterborough's been burned
by the King's men.

01:48:13.388 --> 01:48:16.221
Fitzrobert gathers an army
to slay King John in London.

01:48:16.291 --> 01:48:19.784
Marshal requests your presence
at counsel in Barnsdale.

01:48:21.497 --> 01:48:23.795
Wait outside, will you?

01:48:25.101 --> 01:48:27.535
Cometh the hour, cometh the man.

01:48:28.705 --> 01:48:31.401
The time for pretense is over.

01:48:32.710 --> 01:48:35.406
Now, hold me like a son.

01:48:42.853 --> 01:48:43.877
Go.

01:48:45.457 --> 01:48:48.392
Maggie. Where's my lady?

01:48:48.493 --> 01:48:49.960
I could not find her, sir.

01:49:16.023 --> 01:49:20.859
Whether we fight for our lives,
our family and our honor,

01:49:20.928 --> 01:49:22.691
we must fight till the death.

01:49:23.698 --> 01:49:26.531
You've spent too long in the palace, William.

01:49:26.634 --> 01:49:29.967
Spending time in the palace
gives me perspective.

01:49:31.105 --> 01:49:32.766
As we speak,

01:49:33.842 --> 01:49:36.606
King Philip sails for our coast.

01:49:37.646 --> 01:49:42.140
Godfrey and his marauders are French!

01:49:43.819 --> 01:49:46.721
Every minute that we waste in disunity

01:49:46.790 --> 01:49:50.021
brings closer the destruction of our country!

01:49:50.493 --> 01:49:52.358
We have been bled

01:49:52.996 --> 01:49:54.793
by the King long before Godfrey.

01:49:55.965 --> 01:49:58.764
Go back to London and tell the King

01:49:59.470 --> 01:50:03.236
that we will meet him
on a field of his choice.

01:50:03.307 --> 01:50:04.672
Make way!

01:50:04.742 --> 01:50:07.040
We will not fight
to save John's crown.

01:50:08.079 --> 01:50:10.344
Rather let him bend the knee to us.

01:50:11.416 --> 01:50:13.782
I'll give you more,
Sir Baldwin.

01:50:15.220 --> 01:50:17.552
My breast for your sword point.

01:50:19.291 --> 01:50:20.849
Use mine.

01:50:24.997 --> 01:50:26.191
Go on.

01:50:27.600 --> 01:50:28.931
No?

01:50:29.302 --> 01:50:33.261
Oh, this is what you want, isn't it?
This is what he wants.

01:50:33.339 --> 01:50:37.299
Fine, I'd rather give it to you
than have it taken by the French.

01:50:38.278 --> 01:50:40.542
You mistake me, Sire.

01:50:40.714 --> 01:50:44.582
I have no right and no ambition
to wear the crown.

01:50:45.219 --> 01:50:47.711
But let the rightful wearer beware.

01:50:48.156 --> 01:50:52.252
From now we will be subject only
to laws that we have a hand in making.

01:50:52.327 --> 01:50:57.060
We are not sheep
to be made mutton of by your butchers.

01:50:58.867 --> 01:51:02.531
Godfrey set himself to turn you against me.

01:51:02.605 --> 01:51:05.768
Then he did more than was needed
to accomplish that.

01:51:10.346 --> 01:51:12.508
A very important decision.

01:51:13.350 --> 01:51:16.945
Don't you think that we've paid
too much taxes for far too long...

01:52:24.894 --> 01:52:26.725
This is where I was born.

01:52:40.878 --> 01:52:44.314
- What does it mean?
- It means never give up.

01:52:45.782 --> 01:52:50.277
We will not be loyal to a crown
that robs and starves us!

01:52:50.455 --> 01:52:53.856
The King must listen
to what we have to say!

01:52:53.958 --> 01:52:58.725
A king does not bargain for the loyalty
that every subject owes him.

01:52:58.997 --> 01:53:03.526
Without loyalty there is no kingdom.
There is nothing.

01:53:05.004 --> 01:53:07.165
I'm here to speak for Sir Walter Loxley.

01:53:09.208 --> 01:53:11.403
- Let the man speak.
- Let him speak!

01:53:12.511 --> 01:53:14.343
Speak! Speak!

01:53:14.548 --> 01:53:16.709
Speak, if you must.

01:53:18.351 --> 01:53:21.115
If you're trying to build for the future,

01:53:21.821 --> 01:53:24.346
you must set your foundation strong.

01:53:26.160 --> 01:53:30.620
The laws of this land
enslave people to its king,

01:53:32.300 --> 01:53:36.566
a king who demands loyalty
but offers nothing in return.

01:53:38.139 --> 01:53:41.007
I have marched from France

01:53:41.076 --> 01:53:43.601
to Palestine and back.

01:53:44.580 --> 01:53:45.979
And I know

01:53:46.615 --> 01:53:49.743
in tyranny lies only failure.

01:53:51.354 --> 01:53:53.879
You build a country
like you build a cathedral,

01:53:53.957 --> 01:53:55.151
from the ground up.

01:53:56.326 --> 01:53:58.453
Empower every man

01:53:59.696 --> 01:54:01.596
and you will gain strength.

01:54:01.664 --> 01:54:03.394
Hmm.

01:54:03.467 --> 01:54:06.561
Well, who could object
to such reasonable words?

01:54:09.006 --> 01:54:12.669
If Your Majesty were to offer justice,

01:54:13.911 --> 01:54:16.380
justice in the form of a charter of liberties,

01:54:16.948 --> 01:54:20.679
allowing every man to forage for his hearth,

01:54:21.353 --> 01:54:25.187
to be safe from conviction without cause

01:54:25.256 --> 01:54:26.985
or prison without charge,

01:54:27.727 --> 01:54:31.993
to work, eat and live
on the sweat of his own brow

01:54:32.898 --> 01:54:36.334
- and be as merry as he can...
- Sir, Godfrey's men are on to Nottingham.

01:54:36.602 --> 01:54:39.503
...then that king would be great.

01:54:40.007 --> 01:54:43.841
Not only would he receive
the loyalty of his people

01:54:45.145 --> 01:54:46.942
but their love, as well.

01:54:48.248 --> 01:54:50.773
So what would you have? Hmm?

01:54:50.984 --> 01:54:52.748
Castle for every man?

01:54:55.089 --> 01:54:57.216
Every Englishman's home is his castle.

01:54:58.660 --> 01:55:01.424
What we would ask, Your Majesty,

01:55:02.864 --> 01:55:04.332
is liberty.

01:55:04.667 --> 01:55:06.794
Liberty by law!

01:55:08.737 --> 01:55:11.103
Your Majesty, My Lords,

01:55:11.807 --> 01:55:14.367
the French fleet is in the Channel.

01:55:14.543 --> 01:55:19.538
Sire, you have a chance
to unify your subjects high and low.

01:55:21.251 --> 01:55:23.242
It falls on your nod.

01:55:23.720 --> 01:55:25.688
I only have to nod?

01:55:29.760 --> 01:55:31.557
I can do better than that.

01:55:33.964 --> 01:55:35.761
I give my word

01:55:36.267 --> 01:55:39.395
that such a charter will be written.

01:55:39.470 --> 01:55:42.872
On my mother's life, I swear it.

01:55:47.913 --> 01:55:51.314
Godfrey makes for Nottingham.
I must stay with the King.

01:55:51.383 --> 01:55:53.443
I will send Baldwin and Fitzrobert with you.

01:55:53.519 --> 01:55:57.319
We will meet again at the White Horse
when you are finished.

01:55:57.390 --> 01:56:00.416
Robin, your father was a great man.

01:56:01.728 --> 01:56:03.992
And you are your father's son.

01:56:14.942 --> 01:56:16.466
Maggie, who's at the house?

01:56:18.146 --> 01:56:19.374
Long live the King!

01:56:55.653 --> 01:56:56.745
Gentlemen.

01:57:11.470 --> 01:57:13.563
I'm the Sheriff of Nottingham.

01:57:18.644 --> 01:57:20.545
I'm French on my mother's side.

01:57:41.735 --> 01:57:44.637
Sir Walter! Sir Walter!

01:57:52.814 --> 01:57:54.111
Loxley!

01:57:54.349 --> 01:57:56.011
Show yourself!

01:57:58.154 --> 01:57:59.416
Loxley!

01:58:02.391 --> 01:58:03.824
Who calls here?

01:58:04.327 --> 01:58:06.295
I call for Robert Loxley.

01:58:06.529 --> 01:58:08.498
My son is not here to answer you.

01:58:08.599 --> 01:58:10.066
That is the truth.

01:58:10.300 --> 01:58:12.131
Because he's dead in a French ditch.

01:58:14.271 --> 01:58:15.795
And who are you, sir, to say so?

01:58:17.507 --> 01:58:19.031
Who am I?

01:58:27.652 --> 01:58:29.517
I'm the one who killed him.

01:58:31.322 --> 01:58:33.052
Fight me if you dare.

01:58:33.926 --> 01:58:35.359
Lord have mercy.

01:59:23.813 --> 01:59:25.838
Leave it on the table. Leave it! Next!

01:59:26.816 --> 01:59:28.477
Next! Come on!

01:59:30.286 --> 01:59:31.981
- Name?
- Loxley.

01:59:32.422 --> 01:59:34.015
Christian name?

01:59:34.291 --> 01:59:35.724
Marion.

01:59:36.560 --> 01:59:38.255
Land?

01:59:38.429 --> 01:59:40.192
5,000 acres.

01:59:41.231 --> 01:59:42.960
Lady Marion Loxley?

01:59:43.667 --> 01:59:45.259
I am.

02:00:14.468 --> 02:00:17.528
Gentlemen, enjoy!

02:00:51.007 --> 02:00:53.066
No one should have 4,000 acres.

02:00:53.143 --> 02:00:55.168
5,000 acres.

02:02:33.417 --> 02:02:35.442
Baldwin! Fitzrobert!

02:02:35.520 --> 02:02:38.115
Take the southern flank
and circle in from the west.

02:02:38.624 --> 02:02:41.354
Will and Allan,
get on the rooftops and pick your targets.

02:03:02.583 --> 02:03:03.982
Lady Marion.

02:03:25.473 --> 02:03:26.531
Quickly.

02:03:52.904 --> 02:03:54.371
Follow me.

02:04:16.296 --> 02:04:20.562
Somebody, please take the baby!
Save the baby, please!

02:04:29.977 --> 02:04:31.604
John, down!

02:04:37.852 --> 02:04:39.046
It's all right.

02:04:39.120 --> 02:04:40.280
Go around.

02:04:40.354 --> 02:04:41.617
Stand back!

02:04:43.425 --> 02:04:44.483
Make way!

02:04:45.594 --> 02:04:49.724
Hurry. It's all right. It's all right.
Please, hurry! Hurry!

02:05:01.411 --> 02:05:02.503
Sword!

02:05:22.300 --> 02:05:24.359
Get down, you bastard French dogs!

02:06:14.623 --> 02:06:17.888
Where will King Philip land
and when?

02:06:31.742 --> 02:06:33.710
This is my last arrow.

02:06:35.579 --> 02:06:39.242
Dungeness! Dungeness. Two days.

02:06:43.255 --> 02:06:45.780
There we have it. We have two days.

02:08:12.451 --> 02:08:15.682
Once before I said goodbye
to a man going to war.

02:08:15.988 --> 02:08:17.785
He never came back.

02:08:23.696 --> 02:08:25.425
Ask me nicely.

02:09:00.136 --> 02:09:01.603
I love you, Marion.

02:11:26.294 --> 02:11:27.818
Longstride!

02:11:58.762 --> 02:12:00.923
What news of Walter and Nottingham?

02:12:01.865 --> 02:12:04.460
Sir Walter is dead. Godfrey's hand.

02:12:04.535 --> 02:12:07.265
Gentlemen, we go to war.

02:12:07.505 --> 02:12:11.032
It is my first time. I shall lead.

02:12:11.108 --> 02:12:12.336
Forward!

02:13:52.452 --> 02:13:54.215
That's a lot of French.

02:13:56.456 --> 02:13:58.048
What's to be done?

02:13:59.459 --> 02:14:01.017
Archers to the cliff top.

02:14:01.594 --> 02:14:04.222
Cavalry to the beach. 
We'll await you there.

02:14:04.632 --> 02:14:06.759
- With me!
- Archers!

02:14:09.236 --> 02:14:11.033
Excellent plan.

02:14:32.728 --> 02:14:33.922
Cavalry!

02:14:46.176 --> 02:14:47.609
Ready!

02:15:07.232 --> 02:15:09.962
- Raise arrows!
- Raise arrows!

02:15:11.036 --> 02:15:12.094
Ready!

02:15:15.808 --> 02:15:17.708
Raise arrows!

02:15:18.110 --> 02:15:19.976
Release! Release!

02:15:32.526 --> 02:15:33.584
Release!

02:16:10.701 --> 02:16:11.929
For the love of God, Marion!

02:16:16.306 --> 02:16:17.637
Loxley,

02:16:17.975 --> 02:16:20.911
circle your troops and then join the charge.

02:16:26.051 --> 02:16:27.143
With me!

02:16:32.058 --> 02:16:33.355
Release!

02:16:44.370 --> 02:16:45.429
Release!

02:17:33.022 --> 02:17:35.218
Forward!

02:17:53.210 --> 02:17:54.803
Archers, forward!

02:18:21.875 --> 02:18:23.673
Let's go, Marshal.

02:18:23.745 --> 02:18:25.235
We're close enough, Sire.

02:18:25.914 --> 02:18:27.745
This was not
close enough for Richard.

02:18:27.815 --> 02:18:29.680
And look what happened to him.

02:18:30.718 --> 02:18:32.151
Forward!

02:18:32.654 --> 02:18:34.178
Protect the King!

02:19:05.423 --> 02:19:07.219
This is for you, Walter.

02:19:20.339 --> 02:19:23.331
No!

02:19:30.617 --> 02:19:31.879
Marion!

02:21:15.297 --> 02:21:16.730
Marion!

02:21:44.261 --> 02:21:45.489
Surrender!

02:22:08.454 --> 02:22:10.615
Sire! Sire!

02:22:10.756 --> 02:22:12.815
They've surrendered, Sire!

02:22:13.192 --> 02:22:15.320
Yes! To whom?

02:22:19.366 --> 02:22:20.390
To him.

02:22:20.467 --> 02:22:22.367
Longstride!

02:22:24.037 --> 02:22:25.766
Longstride!

02:22:33.815 --> 02:22:36.079
Longstride!

02:22:37.185 --> 02:22:39.016
Longstride!

02:23:16.928 --> 02:23:19.522
I did not make myself king.

02:23:21.967 --> 02:23:23.366
God did.

02:23:24.236 --> 02:23:26.261
King by divine right.

02:23:27.539 --> 02:23:30.805
Now you come to me with this document

02:23:32.345 --> 02:23:36.213
seeking to limit the authority
given to me by God!

02:23:36.282 --> 02:23:38.807
Sire, you gave your word!

02:23:38.885 --> 02:23:39.943
No.

02:23:40.019 --> 02:23:43.922
- Sire, you give us our word, Sire!
- Did I command you to speak, sir?

02:23:44.157 --> 02:23:46.455
- John...
- Or you, madam?

02:23:46.527 --> 02:23:48.620
Sire, we looked to you!

02:23:48.695 --> 02:23:51.926
Look to your estates, instead.

02:23:54.969 --> 02:23:56.368
Archers!

02:23:56.971 --> 02:24:00.099
You are fortunate
that I am in a merciful mood.

02:24:01.276 --> 02:24:05.680
But as for Robin Longstride,
that mason's son,

02:24:06.849 --> 02:24:11.183
for the crimes of theft
and incitement to cause unrest,

02:24:11.253 --> 02:24:15.553
who pretended to be a knight of the realm,
a crime punishable by death,

02:24:15.624 --> 02:24:20.562
I declare him,
from this day forth, to be an outlaw!

02:24:22.465 --> 02:24:26.094
To be hunted all the days of his life...

02:24:26.202 --> 02:24:30.230
- We will not stand for this!
...until his corpse, unburied, is carrion

02:24:30.308 --> 02:24:33.038
for foxes and crows!

02:24:56.102 --> 02:24:58.036
Hear me! Hear me!

02:25:01.040 --> 02:25:02.735
By royal decree,

02:25:03.309 --> 02:25:06.802
Robin Longstride,
also known as Robin of the Hood,

02:25:07.114 --> 02:25:10.208
and all who shelter him or aid him

02:25:10.284 --> 02:25:11.979
are declared outlaws of the realm,

02:25:13.120 --> 02:25:14.815
Their properties forfeit,

02:25:14.888 --> 02:25:19.053
and their lives shall be taken
by any Englishman on sight.

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:27.696
A nail please? And a hammer.

02:25:28.436 --> 02:25:29.664
A nail!

02:26:20.660 --> 02:26:22.924
Off you go. Come on.

02:26:23.863 --> 02:26:25.023
Hey, boys.

02:26:25.098 --> 02:26:27.066
- You've been practicing tying your knots?
- Yes.

02:26:27.133 --> 02:26:28.964
Have you been shooting
your bow and arrows?

02:26:29.035 --> 02:26:30.627
Who hit something? Anyone?

02:26:30.704 --> 02:26:33.538
<i>The greenwood
is the outlaw's friend.</i>

02:26:33.641 --> 02:26:36.371
<i>Now, the orphan boys make us welcome.</i>

02:26:37.278 --> 02:26:38.677
<i>No tax, no tithe.</i>

02:26:38.746 --> 02:26:43.183
<i>Nobody rich, nobody poor.
Fair shares for all at nature's table.</i>

02:26:43.484 --> 02:26:47.615
<i>Many wrongs to be righted
in the country of King John.</i>

02:26:50.959 --> 02:26:53.120
<i>Watch over us, Walter.</i>

02:27:03.124 --> 02:27:06.572
And so begins the legend.
