00:46.440 --> 00:48.440
Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug...

01:24.480 --> 01:25.720
Just leave it, leave it, leave it.

01:41.520 --> 01:44.400
Chris? Chris?

01:44.480 --> 01:48.880
Fuck! Fuck. Oh, my...
Oh, my God.

02:08.240 --> 02:09.199
Sia.

02:09.280 --> 02:10.560
Guys. Guys, guys, listen up.

02:10.639 --> 02:13.240
Guys, my parents are coming back.
Please, get out quickly.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.200
Out. I'm really sorry, guys.

02:15.280 --> 02:18.000
Please, I'm sorry.
Sorry, the party's over.

02:18.080 --> 02:21.840
The party's over. Can you please go?
Make your way out. Go!

02:22.880 --> 02:24.440
Careful, careful, careful...

02:41.760 --> 02:45.400
Okay. It's okay. Daddy's here.

02:45.480 --> 02:47.000
We're gonna make it all right.

03:02.320 --> 03:05.600
Oh, God. Oh, no.

03:07.080 --> 03:10.120
I don't know how it happened.
I don't. I really don't.

03:11.200 --> 03:15.280
We have to call the police.
Jojo, we have to call the police.

03:18.200 --> 03:19.680
Were there drugs?

03:25.200 --> 03:26.600
Did you sell any?

03:28.280 --> 03:30.280
Did you sell any fucking drugs?

03:30.360 --> 03:31.800
Yes.

03:38.120 --> 03:39.320
No police.

03:49.640 --> 03:50.840
The facts are these:

03:50.920 --> 03:55.600
A party, drugs, someone winds up dead.

03:55.680 --> 03:57.280
Sia? Sia!

03:58.840 --> 04:00.400
Everything we have...

04:01.720 --> 04:08.040
this house, our home, our reputation,
is about to go down the toilet.

04:08.120 --> 04:11.080
- You, prison.
- Jojo.

04:11.160 --> 04:13.640
You want me to sugarcoat it?
There's a dead body in the garden.

04:13.720 --> 04:18.399
She'll go down. Supplying, someone OD's,
that's five years minimum.

04:18.480 --> 04:21.399
Previous for possession, which'll come up,
probably more.

04:21.480 --> 04:23.400
The school will weigh in,
the coke incident.

04:23.480 --> 04:26.040
It'll all come out
and they'll say she's responsible.

04:27.080 --> 04:29.560
So, what are you saying?
What do we do?

04:30.360 --> 04:31.600
Jojo!

04:33.040 --> 04:35.840
Well, if we call the cops, we're screwed.
All of us.

04:35.920 --> 04:37.640
Tarnished.

04:37.720 --> 04:40.280
Dead kid? That shit sticks.

04:40.360 --> 04:44.160
Who's gonna do business with us?
Nobody'll be able to look us in the eye.

04:44.240 --> 04:45.520
But he's dead!

04:45.600 --> 04:48.320
And nothing's gonna make him not dead.

04:48.880 --> 04:53.400
His parents, and my heart breaks for them,
aren't getting their son back.

04:55.040 --> 05:00.600
But maybe, maybe, we can give them hope.

05:01.880 --> 05:04.880
Missing son, hope.

05:04.960 --> 05:07.480
Maybe he's run away?
Maybe he's out there somewhere?

05:07.560 --> 05:10.160
Dead son, no hope, lives ruined.

05:10.240 --> 05:11.800
No, we can't do that.

05:11.880 --> 05:15.360
Can't we? Then you better call the police.

05:18.320 --> 05:20.000
Come in, come in.

05:21.200 --> 05:24.280
So, what can I get you?
Tea, coffee, cheeky brandy?

05:24.840 --> 05:26.720
- I'm fine.
- Not a problem.

05:26.800 --> 05:27.640
Sia!

05:28.960 --> 05:31.000
Here she is, the chief exec.

05:31.080 --> 05:34.320
Lauren, this is Tom.
Dad of Jenny, one of Sia's friends.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.960
We met at that school thing, fundraiser.

05:37.040 --> 05:39.880
I don't think so.
I wouldn't forget such a handsome man.

05:39.960 --> 05:43.080
We've been away.
Wedding anniversary,

05:43.160 --> 05:45.120
back to where we got married.
Reliving it, weren't you?

05:45.200 --> 05:46.560
Did you want me?

05:46.640 --> 05:49.840
No, I bellowed your name up the stairs
for the good of my health.

05:49.920 --> 05:52.560
Tom Delaney, Jenny's dad.
Wondering if you'd seen her?

05:52.640 --> 05:54.320
Jenny? No. Is everything okay?

05:54.400 --> 05:55.880
She hasn't come home.

05:56.640 --> 06:01.240
We also can't find her boyfriend.
Older kid, Chris Chahal.

06:01.800 --> 06:03.000
Well, talk to the man.

06:03.080 --> 06:05.480
Where'd you go last night?
Did you see either of them?

06:14.160 --> 06:15.600
Jojo...

06:16.880 --> 06:19.600
if he's here and Jenny's gone missing,

06:19.680 --> 06:22.400
have you thought that...

06:23.720 --> 06:24.960
He didn't overdose.

06:27.240 --> 06:28.800
She'd already seen him dead.

06:28.880 --> 06:32.160
Or she killed him? Where is she?

07:21.880 --> 07:25.280
Pete, it's me. Where are you?
Is Jenny with you?

07:25.360 --> 07:28.640
I know you saw her.
Call me. Call me as soon as you can.

07:48.800 --> 07:50.120
Pete, open up!

07:52.800 --> 07:53.880
Pete!

08:10.360 --> 08:11.280
Sophie.

08:12.280 --> 08:13.640
I need to see you.

08:14.640 --> 08:16.480
Yeah, just a sec, Tom.

08:27.360 --> 08:28.200
Yes?

08:28.760 --> 08:30.000
Neil Chahal?

08:30.560 --> 08:31.800
Last time I looked.

08:31.880 --> 08:35.960
DC Emma Castle. Your wife is in custody.

08:36.039 --> 08:39.799
I have a Section 18 authorization
to search the premises. May we?

08:39.880 --> 08:42.280
Custody? For what?

08:47.560 --> 08:49.720
This really would be better inside.

09:03.080 --> 09:04.920
Hey, that's mine.

09:12.800 --> 09:15.280
He's not answering his phone.

09:15.360 --> 09:16.800
Yeah. When did you last see him?

09:16.880 --> 09:18.560
Earlier. At work.

09:18.640 --> 09:21.800
Fuck! Fuck, fuck. This is...

09:23.080 --> 09:25.120
He's my best friend. He wouldn't...

09:27.160 --> 09:29.440
I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation.

09:29.520 --> 09:31.000
I know you hate stats.

09:31.080 --> 09:32.200
So don't tell me any.

09:32.280 --> 09:34.240
Nine out of ten disappearances
are connected to somebody known.

09:34.320 --> 09:36.200
Well, this is the one, the exception.

09:36.280 --> 09:38.960
- I'm not accusing him.
- I am.

09:39.040 --> 09:42.960
I don't want to,
but why wouldn't he call me?

09:43.520 --> 09:45.280
I pick up a friend's daughter
late at night,

09:45.360 --> 09:47.640
I'd call them. I'd tell them.

09:50.640 --> 09:53.320
But then the other part of my brain
says, "No."

09:53.400 --> 09:56.000
You know people, you know.

09:56.840 --> 09:58.280
He was there for me.

09:59.400 --> 10:01.080
Even when...

10:01.160 --> 10:05.040
Dad, where are you?
You have to come home.

10:07.120 --> 10:08.400
Come here.

10:08.480 --> 10:12.920
She knew. She sensed it.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.040
No, no, no, no, she didn't know.

10:15.920 --> 10:18.680
We served together. There's no way.

10:19.880 --> 10:23.520
Tom, one thing you learn in my job,
no one knows anyone, not really.

10:24.960 --> 10:26.240
So we need to find him.

10:26.800 --> 10:30.440
I'm going back to the station
to work on it. I'll find Pete.

10:31.040 --> 10:33.720
Last ident I have was three hours ago.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.360
Pete Mayfield's car was seen

10:35.440 --> 10:38.160
near the car park
of the Lakeside View Inn.

10:38.240 --> 10:40.240
Low-end hotel.

10:40.320 --> 10:41.440
He hasn't passed through the next camera

10:41.520 --> 10:43.880
and he hasn't made a return journey, so...

10:43.960 --> 10:45.760
So there's a good chance he's still there?

10:45.840 --> 10:47.520
- Yeah.
- Yeah, thanks.

10:52.440 --> 10:54.360
Sophie, we're going in
to interview the teacher.

10:54.440 --> 10:55.680
She can wait.

10:55.760 --> 10:58.960
Nothing at the house.
Well, nothing obvious, anyway.

10:59.040 --> 11:03.440
We've taken her iPad, digital camera,
a kind of diary thing she keeps.

11:03.520 --> 11:06.920
- And how was the husband?
- Flabbergasted.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.560
Actually, no, he was angry.

11:08.640 --> 11:10.840
He kept shouting,
"Ridiculous, ridiculous."

11:10.920 --> 11:13.280
Well, it's a hard thing to accommodate.

11:13.360 --> 11:15.960
- Did he mention his son?
- No.

11:16.040 --> 11:20.120
Right, well, his son's gone missing.
He hasn't heard from him, no?

11:20.200 --> 11:22.080
He didn't mention it.

11:24.640 --> 11:26.640
So, this guy, Pete...

11:29.200 --> 11:31.840
He was the last one seen with the girl?

11:31.920 --> 11:33.040
Yep.

11:34.480 --> 11:35.560
Right.

11:46.560 --> 11:47.840
Your lawyer's here.

11:57.680 --> 11:59.400
What car are we looking for?

11:59.480 --> 12:01.520
A green four-by-four.
There can't be many of them.

12:04.160 --> 12:06.040
- There.
- Sure?

12:06.120 --> 12:08.040
Yes, and he's leaving.

12:24.160 --> 12:26.600
Is there someone in the car with him?

12:26.680 --> 12:28.320
Whoa, he's going.

12:30.600 --> 12:32.360
Shit, we've lost him.

12:35.160 --> 12:37.640
Can't see him.
Did he stay on this road?

12:46.280 --> 12:47.400
There he is.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.120
Stop, Pete.
Why aren't you stopping?

13:15.360 --> 13:18.320
- Sophie.
- What the hell? Why did you shoot away?

13:18.400 --> 13:21.520
- When?
- We were behind you. You hit the gas.

13:21.600 --> 13:22.520
I never saw you.

13:23.160 --> 13:25.160
- Where's Jenny?
- I don't know.

13:25.800 --> 13:27.400
Mind if we look in the car?

13:27.480 --> 13:30.080
Yes, I do. Sorry, what is this?

13:31.640 --> 13:32.760
Was someone with you?

13:32.840 --> 13:34.800
Jenny Delaney
went missing last night.

13:34.880 --> 13:36.840
You might have been the last person
to have seen her.

13:36.920 --> 13:38.400
Jenny's missing?

14:10.160 --> 14:11.280
I'd like to ring Tom.

14:11.360 --> 14:13.440
You don't need to ring Tom.
Just tell me and I'll tell Tom.

14:13.520 --> 14:16.320
I know I don't need to, but I'd like to.
Am I under arrest, then?

14:16.400 --> 14:17.280
No.

14:17.360 --> 14:19.280
Then I can do what I like.

14:25.440 --> 14:26.280
Pete.

14:26.360 --> 14:29.640
Sorry, man, I've had my phone off.
I'm with Sophie.

14:29.720 --> 14:30.840
Is Jenny there?

14:30.920 --> 14:33.600
No. Listen, I didn't know
anything had happened.

14:33.680 --> 14:35.280
I would have called, I swear.

14:35.360 --> 14:37.000
You picked her up last night.

14:37.080 --> 14:39.680
Yes, yes, but just that.

14:39.760 --> 14:43.600
I picked her up and drove her home,
to the entrance at the gates.

14:43.680 --> 14:44.960
You dropped her home?

14:45.040 --> 14:46.000
What time?

14:46.080 --> 14:48.080
Late. I don't know, maybe 11:30.

14:48.160 --> 14:49.320
Why did you do that?

14:50.560 --> 14:53.080
She called me. She was at this house.

14:53.160 --> 14:55.960
Some big party a few miles away.

14:56.040 --> 14:57.360
Yeah, we know about it.

14:57.440 --> 14:59.120
She was drunk.
I mean, her friends were drunk.

14:59.200 --> 15:02.320
They're piling into this car,
the driver was hammered.

15:02.400 --> 15:04.160
So she rang me to come and take her home.

15:05.160 --> 15:06.760
But why you?

15:06.840 --> 15:10.640
Okay, Tom, I wanna take
all the implications out of this.

15:10.720 --> 15:12.320
I would never hurt her.

15:12.400 --> 15:13.280
We know.

15:13.360 --> 15:17.200
Not hurt her, but is there something
more than a friendship between you?

15:17.280 --> 15:18.600
What are you talking about?

15:18.680 --> 15:20.600
Attraction.

15:20.680 --> 15:22.200
I'm gay.

15:24.040 --> 15:26.360
Tom, I should have called.
I'd overheard her.

15:26.440 --> 15:29.720
Okay? Her and her mates few months back.

15:29.800 --> 15:31.880
They were just talking
about driving drunk.

15:31.960 --> 15:35.680
Laughing it off like this big joke,
and you know my history.

15:36.280 --> 15:37.880
What happened to my dad.

15:37.960 --> 15:39.960
So I took her to one side
and I made her promise

15:40.040 --> 15:42.000
to never get in a car that way.

15:42.080 --> 15:45.960
I said, "You call me day or night
and I'll come and pick you up."

15:46.040 --> 15:48.840
And she never did till last night.

15:48.920 --> 15:50.120
And you dropped her home?

15:50.200 --> 15:51.720
Yeah, right at the gates.

15:51.800 --> 15:53.080
How did she seem?

15:53.160 --> 15:54.280
Drunk, you know.

15:54.360 --> 15:58.240
Kind of pissed off, but she'd been
like that earlier in the day, so...

15:59.360 --> 16:02.040
I dropped her at the gates,
I turned round, I went home.

16:02.120 --> 16:03.640
Why's your phone been off all day?

16:03.720 --> 16:05.520
Because I'm old-fashioned.

16:05.600 --> 16:10.400
I turn it off, so I'm not contactable
every single minute of the day.

16:12.840 --> 16:14.120
And then you went straight home?

16:14.200 --> 16:15.280
Yes.

16:15.360 --> 16:16.680
Can anyone confirm that?

16:16.760 --> 16:17.600
Tom?

16:18.160 --> 16:19.680
I'm climbing out the car now, mate.

16:19.760 --> 16:22.880
And I'm driving over
and I am gonna help you.

16:22.960 --> 16:26.200
So, unless anyone's arresting me here,
I think this conversation's over.

16:26.280 --> 16:27.280
Bye.

16:40.200 --> 16:43.680
You have feelings for him. Well, so do I.

16:43.760 --> 16:46.280
And I've known him a hell of a lot longer.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
Do you believe him?

16:53.000 --> 16:54.280
Not enough.

19:20.320 --> 19:22.840
I promised Jenny
I wouldn't tell anyone, all right?

19:22.920 --> 19:24.600
So she'd trust me. That was the deal.

19:26.600 --> 19:27.720
The boyfriend.

19:28.560 --> 19:30.600
It has to be something
to do with the boyfriend.

19:32.800 --> 19:36.400
I looked, last night, the messages.
I had to.

19:36.480 --> 19:40.000
And there's this one from her to him.

19:40.080 --> 19:42.360
"Don't do it. I'm begging you."

19:42.440 --> 19:44.120
What? It says that?

19:44.200 --> 19:47.440
Yeah, and then she's sending him
a different message. "Tonight. Heaven."

19:48.240 --> 19:49.800
What is that?

19:49.880 --> 19:52.680
Sex? Drugs? Suicide pact?

19:54.040 --> 19:55.320
I'm thinking every thought here.

19:55.400 --> 19:58.520
Okay, okay, let's stop.
Your mind's going a million miles an hour.

19:59.440 --> 20:01.480
This is a gated community, right?

20:01.560 --> 20:03.800
It's safe,
so what's the big advantage of that?

20:03.880 --> 20:06.040
You can see who comes in and who goes out.

20:06.120 --> 20:10.080
I definitely dropped her in.
So, did she go out again?

20:15.720 --> 20:17.520
We need to talk to the girl
who had the party,

20:17.600 --> 20:19.760
see if she'll confirm his story.

20:19.840 --> 20:22.200
Maybe she'll know something
about Jenny's plans.

20:22.280 --> 20:26.640
Why is this such priority?
Because you're friends with her dad?

20:27.840 --> 20:29.760
We have a teacher
waiting to be interviewed.

20:30.360 --> 20:32.560
Compelling evidence
that she's sleeping with a student.

20:32.640 --> 20:35.440
If you think she did it, make her confess.

20:35.520 --> 20:37.520
I'm talking to the girl.

20:37.600 --> 20:40.400
Jenny wouldn't disappear
if there wasn't something wrong.

20:40.480 --> 20:42.840
I'm opening an official investigation.

20:46.800 --> 20:48.400
Well, this is us.

20:48.480 --> 20:51.480
I say us, it's just me.
I used to have a Doberman Pinscher.

20:51.560 --> 20:53.360
You remember Pickles, don't you?

20:53.440 --> 20:54.920
He bit my daughter.

20:55.000 --> 20:58.240
Bit, nip. Nibble, really, weren't it?

20:58.320 --> 21:01.680
Unfortunately, kept happening.
One parent got litigious.

21:01.760 --> 21:04.000
Had to have him put to sleep.

21:04.560 --> 21:06.560
The look in his eye.

21:06.640 --> 21:08.400
I'll never forget it.

21:08.480 --> 21:10.200
What time are we talking last night?

21:10.280 --> 21:11.880
Round half-eleven.

21:11.960 --> 21:13.840
Shouldn't be too difficult.

21:14.400 --> 21:18.920
So that's her entering the perimeter.
Time code 11:35.

21:19.480 --> 21:22.040
Then she heads out of shot.

21:22.120 --> 21:26.200
But we can pick her up here. Camera three.

21:27.800 --> 21:30.520
Wait... wrong way.

21:31.560 --> 21:33.280
Yeah, left would be home.

21:33.360 --> 21:34.640
So, where's she going?

21:34.720 --> 21:37.440
Let's hope camera six tells us.

21:38.640 --> 21:40.200
Who lives there?

21:40.760 --> 21:44.560
That will be, er... Eric Pratchett.

21:45.120 --> 21:46.880
Let's go see him.

21:48.480 --> 21:50.320
Thanks.

21:50.400 --> 21:52.280
Okay, facts.

21:53.880 --> 21:56.720
The following items
were found in your work locker.

21:58.680 --> 22:01.320
Explicit photos of yourself.

22:05.160 --> 22:10.040
An explicit photo of a male torso,
found on a computer memory stick.

22:11.000 --> 22:15.480
Along with correspondence, written to you,
by what would appear to be a student.

22:15.560 --> 22:17.400
Can you explain how they came to be there?

22:18.560 --> 22:19.560
No.

22:20.520 --> 22:22.360
Perhaps someone is angry with me.

22:23.800 --> 22:25.040
Perhaps this is revenge.

22:25.120 --> 22:26.960
Who might be angry with you?

22:28.160 --> 22:29.120
I don't know.

22:29.200 --> 22:32.160
Any reason why anyone would want revenge?

22:32.240 --> 22:34.280
Not that I can think of.

22:34.840 --> 22:36.360
Let me read from them.

22:39.480 --> 22:41.280
"I can't wait till I'm 16,

22:41.360 --> 22:45.040
so we can do everything we do
out in the open.

22:45.120 --> 22:48.040
I'm hating not being able
to tell people about us.

22:49.360 --> 22:53.480
It was so great last night. So amazing."

22:53.560 --> 22:54.720
Six Os.

22:55.640 --> 22:57.760
"Beats homework any day."

22:59.360 --> 23:00.280
Who wrote those words?

23:01.560 --> 23:02.840
I have no idea.

23:03.840 --> 23:05.920
But if you think I'd have sex

23:06.000 --> 23:08.320
with someone who uses six Os...

23:11.320 --> 23:13.320
They were found in your locker.

23:13.400 --> 23:15.400
Well, I can't explain that.

23:15.960 --> 23:17.880
Does anyone else
have access to your locker?

23:17.960 --> 23:19.120
Have you given anyone your key?

23:19.200 --> 23:20.360
No.

23:21.360 --> 23:24.360
But I suppose the school must have a copy
or a master key.

23:25.240 --> 23:28.200
Okay, so somebody else
could have opened it,

23:28.280 --> 23:30.720
placed inside the memory stick.

23:30.800 --> 23:32.880
But could they also have credibly placed,

23:32.960 --> 23:36.560
on the same memory stick,
photographs of you?

23:36.640 --> 23:40.040
Extremely explicit photographs.
Is that realistic?

23:42.400 --> 23:44.080
How do you know this is me?

23:44.160 --> 23:45.080
Is it you?

23:45.960 --> 23:47.760
Well, it's my face.

23:47.840 --> 23:49.280
So you're saying it's not you?

23:50.400 --> 23:52.680
Have you heard of Photoshop?

23:52.760 --> 23:57.040
So, for clarity, you're denying
that these images are of you?

23:57.120 --> 23:58.600
Of your body?

24:00.280 --> 24:01.320
Yes.

24:03.840 --> 24:05.000
Okay.

24:06.400 --> 24:09.360
We magnified the image on this one.

24:10.640 --> 24:16.160
And on the right hip, just visible,
is the corner of a tattoo.

24:17.160 --> 24:21.680
It appears to be some kind of creature.
Maybe a scorpion.

24:26.840 --> 24:28.120
Do you have a tattoo like that?

24:32.720 --> 24:36.280
For the recording, do you,
in this exact position,

24:36.360 --> 24:38.680
have a tattoo that matches
the one in the photograph?

24:41.320 --> 24:42.400
Yes.

25:01.280 --> 25:02.120
Hello.

25:02.200 --> 25:05.240
Eric, my daughter, Jenny,

25:05.320 --> 25:08.560
she was seen coming
towards this house last night. Late.

25:08.640 --> 25:10.040
And?

25:10.120 --> 25:15.120
She's missing. That's your "and."
So I need facts. Now.

25:15.200 --> 25:17.040
She ran across my lawn.

25:18.040 --> 25:20.560
My security light came on.

25:20.640 --> 25:24.160
And I went to the window as I always do
when the light comes on, always.

25:25.160 --> 25:26.600
And I yelled at her.

25:26.680 --> 25:27.600
Yelled what?

25:27.680 --> 25:30.400
Swear words, like, "piss off,"

25:30.960 --> 25:34.080
"off my sodding lawn," something.

25:34.160 --> 25:35.680
She took off,

25:35.760 --> 25:38.320
disappeared through the trees
at the back of the house.

25:40.040 --> 25:43.040
Your house backs
onto Neil and Zoe Chahal's house?

25:43.120 --> 25:44.280
Correct.

25:44.360 --> 25:45.560
That's Chris, the boyfriend.

25:45.640 --> 25:50.800
Yes. And when you find her,
tell her I'm not a thoroughfare.

25:54.600 --> 25:57.880
What a lovely man.
Should arrange a dinner.

26:15.800 --> 26:17.400
It's like being back in the army.

26:17.480 --> 26:19.400
Yeah, just like it.

26:57.640 --> 26:59.080
There's a car here.

27:00.520 --> 27:02.400
People do walk, Darren.

27:02.480 --> 27:03.600
Well, there's a light on.

27:04.400 --> 27:07.160
So, the new DC...

27:08.160 --> 27:09.480
What about her?

27:10.520 --> 27:12.480
Well, you got to know her a bit?

27:12.560 --> 27:14.760
It's day one. We're hardly booking
mini-breaks together.

27:14.840 --> 27:17.920
Funny move, city to suburbs.

27:19.280 --> 27:21.880
Is there a guy involved, or is she single?

27:21.960 --> 27:25.520
For God's sake, really?
Come on, let's check round the back.

27:25.600 --> 27:30.200
I don't fancy her.
I was just curious. She's not my type.

27:46.360 --> 27:48.360
They're looking at the pool.
Why are they looking at the pool?

27:48.440 --> 27:49.880
They can't know anything.

27:49.960 --> 27:51.520
Are you sure no one else saw him?

27:51.600 --> 27:52.760
No, it was just me.

27:52.840 --> 27:54.240
So, why are they down there?

27:54.320 --> 27:55.920
I don't know!

28:01.080 --> 28:02.480
What are you looking at?

28:02.560 --> 28:04.600
- That plant's been moved.
- So?

28:04.680 --> 28:06.240
So, why would someone do that?

28:06.320 --> 28:09.440
Because they wanted the plant
in a different position?

28:11.320 --> 28:14.600
Look, they're obviously not here.
Try again tomorrow?

28:17.440 --> 28:18.640
Yeah.

28:21.120 --> 28:22.240
They're going.

28:24.320 --> 28:25.680
We need to move him.

28:25.760 --> 28:28.160
We will. Tonight.

28:28.240 --> 28:29.640
I've got an idea...

28:31.720 --> 28:33.040
but I'll need his thumb.

28:36.120 --> 28:39.880
Zoe, a decision has been made
for you to be bailed.

28:39.960 --> 28:42.280
The custody sergeant will give you
your bail conditions,

28:42.360 --> 28:44.320
but the LEA have asked me to inform you

28:44.400 --> 28:47.360
that you are suspended
with immediate effect.

28:47.440 --> 28:50.520
You are not allowed
to enter St. Winifred's High School

28:50.600 --> 28:53.920
and you are not allowed contact,
directly or indirectly,

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
with any colleagues, parents or students.

29:05.240 --> 29:07.520
It's about Chris. Can we come in?

29:11.320 --> 29:12.520
Okay.

29:12.600 --> 29:17.000
I told you, just this morning,
we don't know anything about this.

29:17.080 --> 29:20.760
Jenny may have come here,
she may have sneaked into our garden,

29:20.840 --> 29:22.760
but if Chris was at the party with her
last night,

29:22.840 --> 29:26.480
why would she do that?
Why would they meet here?

29:26.560 --> 29:27.880
Has Chris been in touch?

29:27.960 --> 29:31.240
Not with me. For him that's not unusual.

29:31.320 --> 29:33.520
Are you not worried? He's only 19.

29:33.600 --> 29:36.360
He's a man. I don't wipe his arse anymore.

29:37.280 --> 29:40.680
Look, look, there's a theme, okay.

29:40.760 --> 29:43.360
I didn't want to get into it this morning
because Zoe doesn't know

29:43.440 --> 29:45.120
and it would have
just created this whole big...

29:46.120 --> 29:49.440
So, he's pissed off with me, okay?

29:49.520 --> 29:52.560
I told him some news that...

29:52.640 --> 29:57.200
I told him me and his mum were separating.
I thought he deserved to know.

29:57.280 --> 30:00.360
So, fine, he calls me a prick.
He says it's all my fault.

30:00.440 --> 30:03.280
Okay, whatever. Storms out.

30:03.360 --> 30:06.560
Some bullshit to his mum
about where he's staying.

30:06.640 --> 30:11.200
Ask me where he is, I'll tell you.
He's burning off his anger.

30:11.280 --> 30:15.200
Either that or he's trying to punish me.
You know, the heavy silence routine.

30:15.760 --> 30:19.640
But ask me, am I worried? No.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.360
Emphatically no.

30:23.800 --> 30:26.440
Do you mind if we take a look in his room?

30:26.520 --> 30:30.880
Tom's daughter sent Chris some messages
that kind of worry us.

30:32.800 --> 30:34.200
What kind of messages?

30:35.160 --> 30:37.080
"Don't do it. I'm begging you."

30:38.600 --> 30:42.480
And one that just said,
"Tonight. Heaven."

30:54.720 --> 30:57.800
That's Zoe's idea. It's above the garage.

30:57.880 --> 31:00.560
He spent so much time down there
messing with his Vespa,

31:00.640 --> 31:03.000
she suggested he live up here.

31:03.080 --> 31:06.680
The joke has become a reality
at great personal expense.

31:06.760 --> 31:10.120
Did he go out on it last night? The Vespa?

31:10.200 --> 31:12.120
Yeah, most likely. It's not here.

31:12.680 --> 31:14.400
Why'd he drop out of uni?

31:15.640 --> 31:19.760
Well, the official version,
he couldn't connect with his course,

31:19.840 --> 31:22.360
wanted to reassess his options.

31:22.440 --> 31:25.280
My version, he's bone idle
and likes getting stoned too much.

31:25.360 --> 31:26.960
Here, mate, this could be something.

31:27.600 --> 31:29.120
What's that?

31:29.200 --> 31:31.520
Don't know. Train times?
Booking reference?

31:31.600 --> 31:32.720
Could be anything.

31:33.280 --> 31:34.280
Yeah, that's trains.

31:34.360 --> 31:36.600
We should check these times,
find which direction.

31:36.680 --> 31:39.880
Someone's home. It could be Chris.

31:40.840 --> 31:42.200
Hello? Chris?

31:42.280 --> 31:43.760
No, it's me.

31:45.480 --> 31:47.480
- Sorry.
- They're going.

31:48.600 --> 31:51.000
Sorry.
I just had a few more questions.

31:51.080 --> 31:52.320
Have you heard from Chris?

31:53.440 --> 31:54.480
No.

31:59.560 --> 32:00.960
I hope you find her.

32:01.880 --> 32:06.240
Wow. Was it me or was there
a very strange vibe in there?

32:06.320 --> 32:07.760
Strange vibe?

32:07.840 --> 32:09.520
Do you think she'd been crying?

32:09.600 --> 32:11.000
I'm certain of it.

32:16.560 --> 32:19.400
Maybe Jenny just never really forgave me.

32:22.240 --> 32:23.480
Come on.

32:34.360 --> 32:37.560
Hey, it's Chris. Leave a message.

32:37.640 --> 32:39.000
Chris, it's Mum.
Where are you?

32:39.080 --> 32:41.880
I'm worried. You didn't come home
last night. Call me.

32:41.960 --> 32:42.800
I love you.

32:56.960 --> 32:59.000
The person
you are calling is unavailable.

32:59.080 --> 33:01.000
Please leave a message after the beep.

33:01.080 --> 33:04.040
Hey, it's me.

33:04.120 --> 33:06.800
There's a problem. I need to see you.

33:17.800 --> 33:19.200
Today? Yesterday?

33:19.280 --> 33:20.640
No, I haven't seen her. Sorry.

33:20.720 --> 33:22.440
Do you recognize this girl?

33:42.160 --> 33:43.320
Have you seen this girl?

33:44.880 --> 33:46.280
Excuse me.

33:46.360 --> 33:50.120
Have you seen this girl?
Sorry, round here? Today? Yesterday?

33:50.200 --> 33:53.040
- I don't remember her, no.
- Okay.

34:08.840 --> 34:09.920
Carrie? Hi.

34:10.000 --> 34:13.320
Dad? She's with Chris, Jenny.

34:13.400 --> 34:16.800
He posted photos online. She looks happy.

34:17.840 --> 34:18.679
She's okay.

34:32.239 --> 34:35.960
Right, the only place no one ever goes
is my private loo.

34:36.040 --> 34:37.159
We'll put him under lock and key

34:37.239 --> 34:39.040
until we work out
something more permanent.

34:56.120 --> 34:59.280
- Come on, hurry up!
- I'm going as fast as I can!

34:59.360 --> 35:00.520
Come on!

35:00.600 --> 35:01.960
You push him!

35:02.880 --> 35:05.800
- No, no, no, no...
- No, no, I've got it. I can help!

35:07.200 --> 35:08.920
Okay, let go. Let go!

35:15.520 --> 35:16.720
I can't do this.

35:16.800 --> 35:19.800
- You can't stop now. Push.
- I can't. It's too heavy.

35:19.880 --> 35:21.520
Why can't we leave him downstairs?

35:21.600 --> 35:23.000
What, sat up in reception?

35:23.080 --> 35:24.840
- Push!
- I can't!

35:25.960 --> 35:27.840
I can't!

35:28.840 --> 35:30.080
Lauren!

35:35.480 --> 35:39.280
I can't do this, Jojo.
I can't do it.

35:40.240 --> 35:41.560
We're going to the police.

35:44.240 --> 35:47.440
Seems they bought train tickets.
Chris' Vespa was at the station.

35:47.520 --> 35:50.800
I checked the times they'd written down
with the timetable, and they go south.

35:50.880 --> 35:54.400
- Into the city.
- She bought a fake ID off a guy online.

35:54.480 --> 35:57.760
Why? What'd you need an ID for?
Drinking? Clubbing?

35:59.560 --> 36:03.640
Maybe she's just run away.
Gone off, so she can...

36:05.240 --> 36:06.760
Why would she do that?

36:15.560 --> 36:18.560
This is the last dress
Rachel helped her buy.

36:19.120 --> 36:23.320
She was too sick, really.
But I remember driving them to the shop.

36:25.160 --> 36:29.560
Jenny tried on a hundred things,
but nothing was good enough for Rachel.

36:31.040 --> 36:34.880
But maybe she just wanted
to stay there longer with her daughter.

36:37.520 --> 36:41.160
She wasn't wearing that dress
at the party.

36:42.240 --> 36:44.960
Maybe she packed it?
If you're running away?

36:45.040 --> 36:47.320
Have you checked her wardrobe?

37:12.160 --> 37:13.520
Where were you?

37:23.040 --> 37:26.800
The dress is here. She's not okay.

37:33.120 --> 37:34.800
What's Chris done to her?

37:34.880 --> 37:37.280
Why is he posting old photos?

37:37.360 --> 37:40.960
I don't know. I can get tech on to it,

37:41.040 --> 37:42.880
find out when
the account was last accessed?

37:44.240 --> 37:45.560
Hey.

38:17.400 --> 38:18.840
Hello, hello.

38:19.880 --> 38:23.480
Er, I'm John Joseph Marshall.
This is my daughter, Sia.

38:23.560 --> 38:27.400
Our neighbor tells us that
your lot came round yesterday.

38:27.480 --> 38:32.080
I'm assuming it was for a statement.
So we're here to save you a return trip.

38:32.160 --> 38:36.160
So I've got 70 bloody kids
rampaging through my house.

38:36.240 --> 38:37.600
I've got an idea.

38:39.640 --> 38:41.440
I'll need his thumb.

38:42.360 --> 38:43.880
Massive party?

38:43.960 --> 38:45.760
And this is everyone you can remember?

38:45.840 --> 38:49.680
You know how it goes. People bring people.
People I don't know.

38:59.120 --> 39:01.760
And you didn't know anything
about this party?

39:01.840 --> 39:04.480
No, I did not. As I said,
I was away with the missus.

39:04.560 --> 39:06.440
Callow Hall Hotel. You ever been?

39:06.520 --> 39:09.400
It's a beautiful place.
For romance, for golf.

39:09.480 --> 39:11.760
All your holes in one place.

39:19.400 --> 39:20.760
I'm assuming there was alcohol?

39:20.840 --> 39:22.200
They're not angels.

39:22.760 --> 39:23.800
Yes.

39:29.120 --> 39:30.080
Drugs?

39:31.440 --> 39:34.560
No. Not as far as I know.

39:43.400 --> 39:45.400
I mean, what people did in the toilets,
I don't know,

39:45.480 --> 39:47.880
but I didn't see anything.

40:00.600 --> 40:01.560
Pete?

40:01.640 --> 40:03.520
I think I know what "Heaven" is.

40:03.600 --> 40:05.920
It used to be a gay bar in the city
called Meat.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.280
Now it's an '80s bar called Heaven.

40:31.760 --> 40:32.600
Excuse me.

40:32.680 --> 40:33.880
Can we help you?

40:33.960 --> 40:38.360
I'm looking for this girl.
She's my daughter.

40:38.440 --> 40:39.440
She a regular?

40:40.440 --> 40:41.320
No.

40:41.400 --> 40:43.480
I've got a suspicion
she might have come here.

40:43.560 --> 40:44.840
Maybe you saw her.

40:47.240 --> 40:49.760
Er, what's going on here? Who's this?

40:49.840 --> 40:52.920
This man's looking for his daughter.
Wanted to know if we'd seen her.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.160
Tom Delaney. Sorry to bother you.

40:55.240 --> 40:57.240
No worries, parental concern.

40:58.200 --> 41:01.160
Let's have a look, then.
I pride myself on being good with faces.

41:01.240 --> 41:02.760
Especially where women are concerned.

41:03.640 --> 41:04.800
Sorry.

41:04.880 --> 41:06.680
Mind you, they're all someone's daughter.

41:10.880 --> 41:12.640
- How old is she?
- Sixteen.

41:13.280 --> 41:15.400
- Sixteen?
- She can look older.

41:15.480 --> 41:17.680
She'd never have got inside.
We have a strict policy.

41:17.760 --> 41:18.880
She has fake ID.

41:18.960 --> 41:21.880
She looks what she is. A kid.

41:21.960 --> 41:25.040
I really doubt she'd have made it
past the door. Sorry.

41:26.280 --> 41:28.480
Are you sure no one underage
ever gets in here?

41:28.560 --> 41:29.520
That seems unlikely.

41:29.600 --> 41:30.880
I'm sure.

41:34.720 --> 41:36.160
Okay, thanks for taking a look.

41:36.240 --> 41:38.600
My pleasure. I hope you find her.

41:46.600 --> 41:50.960
That was our one chance to come clean.
Our one chance for regret!

41:51.040 --> 41:52.680
Lauren, keep calm.

41:52.760 --> 41:54.320
Screw "keep calm!"

41:54.400 --> 41:57.440
No, Lauren, we can't screw "keep calm."

41:57.520 --> 42:00.840
We have to embrace it, nurture it,
give it a great big hug,

42:00.920 --> 42:03.880
because right now,
"keep calm" is all we've bloody got.

42:05.240 --> 42:06.720
That's it, alert the neighbors.

42:06.800 --> 42:09.120
"Did you hear anything unusual
in the days after the death?"

42:09.200 --> 42:12.440
"Yes, I heard the fearful panicked screams
of the woman that lives there."

42:12.520 --> 42:15.000
Just stop it! Okay?

42:15.080 --> 42:16.280
Stop it.

42:17.360 --> 42:21.640
It's done. We've gotta deal with it.
We've got no choice.

42:28.080 --> 42:29.600
Maybe I deserve this.

42:30.360 --> 42:31.440
Karma.

42:33.760 --> 42:35.120
For what?

42:49.800 --> 42:52.800
Hey, you read the notes I made
on the interview with Sia Marshall?

42:53.600 --> 42:54.800
Yeah, pretty unexceptional.

42:54.880 --> 42:56.960
Yes. Except, call me genius.

42:57.040 --> 42:59.600
I rang the hotel the parents stayed at
just to confirm they attended,

42:59.680 --> 43:01.920
- and you'll never guess what.
- What?

43:03.040 --> 43:03.880
They left early.

43:04.680 --> 43:07.320
Checked out with some excuse.
They had to get home around midnight.

43:08.360 --> 43:09.720
Heading home? Why?

43:09.800 --> 43:12.160
Sounds like somebody knew
there was a party.

43:12.240 --> 43:14.040
Sounds like somebody's
been lying to our face.

43:16.640 --> 43:19.200
Sia, there's some rope in the garage
on the high shelf.

43:20.080 --> 43:21.560
Go and get it.

43:22.600 --> 43:23.880
What does it look like?

43:26.160 --> 43:27.320
Rope.

43:29.200 --> 43:30.440
Yeah.

43:53.360 --> 43:54.520
Jojo!

43:55.920 --> 43:56.800
Anyone at home?

43:57.920 --> 44:00.400
Hello? Anyone at home?

44:02.160 --> 44:03.000
Jojo?

44:05.640 --> 44:09.160
Jojo, I've had this at my house for...
