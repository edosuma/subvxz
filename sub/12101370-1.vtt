-I don't know. I woke up in the pod.

<i>Can't you knock to alert someone?</i>

16:09.916 --> 16:13.416

-I don't know--
<i>-The last thing you remember.</i>

16:42.250 --> 16:43.875
A hospital, I think.

16:57.833 --> 17:00.583
The computer has to know.

17:00.666 --> 17:02.000
MILO, location of the unit.

17:02.083 --> 17:05.166
<i>Unit location impossible to determine.</i>

-What do you mean?
<i>-We're trying to zero in.</i>

17:14.625 --> 17:17.000
Maybe I'm buried, underground.

17:17.083 --> 17:20.291
<i>-Try to stay calm.</i>
-Maybe I've been buried alive.

17:20.375 --> 17:22.500
<i>-Calm down, ma'am.</i>
-Stop telling me to calm down!

If I'm underground, you'll never find me.

You're not telling me the truth.

Tell me.

21:21.916 --> 21:24.250
You know where I am

<i>after medical school in Paris.</i>

43:47.791 --> 43:49.916
Oxford.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.791
I remember Oxford. That's where I met Léo.

43:54.791 --> 43:57.708
<i>That's where I met him.</i>
<i>He's real. I know he is.</i>

43:57.791 --> 43:58.625
<i>Elizabeth?</i>

43:58.708 --> 44:00.750
Look for Léo. I swear he exists.

44:01.791 --> 44:03.791
<i>Oxygen level: 15%.</i>

44:03.875 --> 44:07.375
<i>-Alert. Blood pressure at 210/130.</i>
-Where are you? You should have found me.

44:07.458 --> 44:09.291
<i>Stay strong. Just a few more minutes.</i>

44:10.041 --> 44:11.833
I need the codes.

44:11.916 --> 44:14.833
<i>I have guys at Cryosalide</i>
<i>getting the codes.</i>

44:14.916 --> 44:17.666
But why? What? It's taking too long.

44:19.333 --> 44:20.875
Who are you talking to?

44:21.583 --> 44:23.625
What? Hello?

44:23.708 --> 44:26.416
Who are you talking to?
I hear you talking to someone.

44:26.500 --> 44:29.083
<i>-You're hearing things.</i>
-You're talking. No, no.

44:29.166 --> 44:32.166
<i>Liz. We're on it. We're close.</i>
<i>We're really close.</i>

44:32.250 --> 44:33.750
-You're lying.
<i>-We're 20 minutes away.</i>

44:33.833 --> 44:35.750
-Are you doing this to me?
<i>-We're nearly there.</i>

44:37.625 --> 44:39.583
<i>I was in the army.</i>
<i>I spent months underground.</i>

44:39.666 --> 44:40.958
You're doing this to me.

44:41.041 --> 44:44.125
<i>I've been in that situation.</i>
<i>I know what you're going through.</i>

44:45.125 --> 44:46.416
<i>-I'm with you--</i>
-MILO, hang up.

44:46.500 --> 44:48.416
<i>-No, Liz--</i>
-MILO, hang up.

44:48.500 --> 44:50.333
<i>-Wait.</i>
<i>-Disconnected.</i>

46:31.125 --> 46:32.125
<i>Incoming call.</i>

46:36.833 --> 46:37.916
<i>Incoming call.</i>

46:38.833 --> 46:39.833
Reject call.

46:40.666 --> 46:41.833
<i>Call rejected.</i>

46:44.250 --> 46:47.541
MILO, play the last 30 seconds
of the last transmission again.

46:49.541 --> 46:51.458
<i>I need the codes.</i>

46:51.541 --> 46:54.416
<i>I have guys at Cryosalide</i>
<i>getting the codes.</i>

46:54.500 --> 46:55.750
<i>But why?</i>

46:58.625 --> 47:00.000
<i>Who are you talking to?</i>

47:00.083 --> 47:00.916
Pause.

47:02.541 --> 47:04.500
Play the last five seconds again.

47:11.875 --> 47:12.791
Pause.

47:14.166 --> 47:16.875
Turn up the volume and play it back.

47:18.583 --> 47:21.583
<i>Tell her she's hearing things.</i>
<i>That it's the stress.</i>

47:24.250 --> 47:25.250
Again.

47:27.041 --> 47:29.625
<i>Tell her she's hearing things.</i>
<i>That it's the stress.</i>

47:31.291 --> 47:32.458
<i>Who are you talking to?</i>

47:33.083 --> 47:34.083
Pause.

47:35.083 --> 47:36.250
<i>Incoming call.</i>

47:37.208 --> 47:38.458
Reject call.

47:39.291 --> 47:40.500
<i>Call rejected.</i>

47:42.500 --> 47:44.583
Can you see me? Can you hear me?

47:45.833 --> 47:47.375
What do you want from me?

47:47.458 --> 47:48.541
<i>Incoming call.</i>

47:50.833 --> 47:52.666
Are you assholes messing with me?

47:53.375 --> 47:54.750
MILO, accept the call.

47:55.541 --> 47:56.416
Who are you?

47:57.291 --> 48:00.000
Why are you doing this to me?

48:00.083 --> 48:00.916
<i>Hello?</i>

48:02.250 --> 48:03.375
<i>Don't hang up.</i>

48:04.000 --> 48:05.500
<i>Answer me, please.</i>

48:06.708 --> 48:09.333
<i>You're in a cryogenic unit, is that right?</i>

48:09.416 --> 48:11.416
<i>You called me, looking for Léo.</i>

48:11.500 --> 48:13.166
<i>Listen, we don't have much time.</i>

48:13.250 --> 48:15.041
<i>It wasn't supposed to happen like this.</i>

48:15.125 --> 48:16.583
<i>Something must have gone wrong.</i>

48:17.125 --> 48:18.916
-I want to talk to Léo.
<i>-Impossible.</i>

48:19.000 --> 48:21.041
<i>You must listen to me. I can help you.</i>

48:21.125 --> 48:23.583
I won't listen until I speak to Léo.

48:23.666 --> 48:24.666
<i>That's impossible.</i>

48:24.750 --> 48:29.666
I want to talk to him now. Put him on now.

48:29.750 --> 48:31.083
<i>Léo is dead.</i>

48:31.166 --> 48:32.250
What?

48:34.333 --> 48:35.708
I don't believe you.

48:35.791 --> 48:37.416
<i>You really need to listen to me.</i>

48:38.125 --> 48:39.625
<i>-Liz… No.</i>
-Go to hell.

48:39.708 --> 48:42.250
-MILO, end the call.
<i>-No, wait--</i>

48:42.333 --> 48:46.083
<i>Call ended. Oxygen level: 14%.</i>

48:47.250 --> 48:48.250
<i>Incoming call.</i>

48:50.541 --> 48:51.625
<i>Incoming call.</i>

48:55.125 --> 48:57.458
MILO, accept call.

48:57.541 --> 48:58.500
<i>Listen to me.</i>

48:59.083 --> 49:00.500
<i>I can help you.</i>

49:00.583 --> 49:03.708
<i>No one else can help you</i>
<i>at this point, Liz.</i>

49:03.791 --> 49:05.916
How do you know my name? I never told you.

49:06.666 --> 49:09.833
<i>No need. I knew who you were</i>
<i>the moment I heard your voice,</i>

49:09.916 --> 49:11.458
<i>even though I couldn't believe it.</i>

49:11.541 --> 49:13.166
Tell me who you are and the others.

49:13.250 --> 49:16.125
<i>I don't know who you spoke to,</i>
<i>but I know what's going on.</i>

49:16.208 --> 49:18.666
-MILO, end--
<i>-I know the codes.</i>

49:18.750 --> 49:19.583
Give them to me.

49:19.666 --> 49:22.458
<i>-I'll do that, but you have to listen--</i>
-Give them to me.

49:22.541 --> 49:25.666
<i>You can't use them to open the unit.</i>

49:26.958 --> 49:28.708
-MILO, end the--
<i>-Okay, okay.</i>

49:30.708 --> 49:34.833
<i>Uppercase N-M-347.</i>

49:34.916 --> 49:38.500
<i>Lowercase C-D-A.</i>

49:40.916 --> 49:43.208
Transfer of administrator control.

49:43.791 --> 49:48.750
<i>Administrator control transfer launched.</i>
<i>Enter the password.</i>

49:49.333 --> 49:54.750
Uppercase N-M-347. Lowercase C-D-A.

49:54.833 --> 49:57.291
<i>Liz, don't open it. Please.</i>

49:57.375 --> 50:02.916
<i>Administrator control transfer complete.</i>
<i>Administrator privileges granted.</i>

50:07.291 --> 50:10.291
MILO, unlock.

50:11.166 --> 50:12.583
<i>Unlocking activated.</i>

50:14.125 --> 50:16.000
<i>Please, no. You'll die.</i>

50:16.541 --> 50:19.541
<i>I can prove it.</i>
<i>If you open the unit, you'll die.</i>

50:19.625 --> 50:22.083
MILO, pause unlocking.
You have ten seconds.

50:22.166 --> 50:24.125
<i>Thank you. Just let me explain.</i>

50:24.208 --> 50:25.750
-Eight seconds.
<i>-Okay, okay!</i>

50:25.833 --> 50:27.875
<i>Go to "system preferences."</i>

50:27.958 --> 50:30.250
<i>Find the centrifuge controls.</i>

50:30.333 --> 50:32.583
-System preferences.
<i>-Please. Just let me explain.</i>

50:32.666 --> 50:34.000
Centrifuge controls.

50:35.541 --> 50:36.541
Got them.

50:37.333 --> 50:39.500
<i>It's set at one. Switch to…</i>

50:39.583 --> 50:41.500
Switch to what?

50:41.583 --> 50:44.041
<i>-This isn't how you should find out.</i>
-Switch to what?

50:44.541 --> 50:45.458
MILO…

50:45.541 --> 50:47.416
<i>Zero. Switch to zero.</i>

50:48.208 --> 50:49.541
Switch to zero.

50:51.000 --> 50:53.208
<i>Please, Liz. Don't do it.</i>

50:53.291 --> 50:55.541
<i>Turning off microthrusters.</i>

50:55.625 --> 50:58.625
<i>I'm sorry, Liz. I really am.</i>

51:06.291 --> 51:11.666
<i>Alert. Lengthy exposure to weightlessness</i>
<i>can be harmful to the bio-form.</i>

51:13.333 --> 51:14.333
<i>Liz.</i>

51:25.916 --> 51:26.916
<i>Liz!</i>

51:27.541 --> 51:28.791
Where am I?

51:28.875 --> 51:32.583
<i>Around 40,389 miles from Earth.</i>

51:32.666 --> 51:34.250
No, no, no.

51:39.125 --> 51:41.875
MILO, distance from Earth?

51:41.958 --> 51:44.875
<i>Forty two thousand, seven hundred</i>
<i>and thirty-five miles.</i>

51:47.291 --> 51:48.916
That's not possible.

51:50.166 --> 51:52.333
<i>Sorry, Liz. But time is limited.</i>

51:53.416 --> 51:56.750
<i>You'll soon be beyond the range</i>
<i>of our communication satellites.</i>

52:01.083 --> 52:02.416
THRUST INITIALIZATION? CANCEL - OK

52:02.500 --> 52:05.750
<i>Centrifuge rotation launched.</i>
<i>G-1 launched.</i>

52:05.833 --> 52:07.833
<i>Oxygen level: 13%.</i>

52:08.750 --> 52:10.250
<i>Liz, please.</i>

52:10.333 --> 52:13.750
<i>You were placed in hypersleep</i>
<i>to allow you to carry out your mission.</i>

52:14.833 --> 52:16.291
<i>But something went wrong.</i>

52:17.041 --> 52:18.458
<i>I can't bring you home.</i>

52:19.916 --> 52:21.625
<i>But I designed the system,</i>

52:21.708 --> 52:24.458
<i>and maybe we could</i>
<i>put you back into hypersleep.</i>

52:24.541 --> 52:27.333
<i>It would give you a chance. Please.</i>

52:27.916 --> 52:28.916
What mission?

52:30.083 --> 52:34.666
<i>If we can locate the damage,</i>
<i>divert the affected systems…</i>

52:34.750 --> 52:35.833
What mission?

52:37.416 --> 52:41.708
<i>Colonizing a planet</i>
<i>orbiting around Wolf 10-61,</i>

52:41.791 --> 52:43.875
<i>14 light-years from Earth.</i>

52:43.958 --> 52:45.500
<i>But you only just left.</i>

52:46.083 --> 52:50.333
<i>Your HIVE transporter hasn't yet engaged</i>
<i>its nuclear-powered thrust.</i>

52:50.958 --> 52:53.916
No, no, no.

52:54.000 --> 52:55.833
<i>Liz, we have to act fast.</i>

52:55.916 --> 52:57.500
This isn't real.

53:10.666 --> 53:14.791
Was it a military operation?
Do I work for the Ministry of Defense?

53:14.875 --> 53:16.541
<i>Yes. Do you remember?</i>

53:16.625 --> 53:17.750
Why the army?

53:18.583 --> 53:21.708
<i>The human race will die out</i>
<i>in two generations.</i>

53:21.791 --> 53:23.708
<i>That can't be made public.</i>

53:26.125 --> 53:27.333
Did he know?

53:27.416 --> 53:28.416
<i>Who?</i>

53:29.583 --> 53:31.041
That guy. Moreau.

53:32.041 --> 53:34.750
When I asked for help, he was kind,

53:35.541 --> 53:37.583
-but he was lying to me, right?
<i>-Liz.</i>

53:37.666 --> 53:39.125
<i>He had no choice.</i>

53:39.208 --> 53:42.083
<i>As soon as the police</i>
<i>looked for information about you,</i>

53:42.166 --> 53:43.541
<i>the Ministry got involved.</i>

53:44.541 --> 53:48.000
<i>Everything said after that</i>
<i>was only what they wanted you to hear.</i>

53:48.083 --> 53:48.916
But why?

53:49.500 --> 53:53.958
If I was a key part of the project,
why not just tell me the truth?

53:54.625 --> 53:56.125
<i>The fog of memory.</i>

53:56.208 --> 54:00.875
<i>It was impossible to foresee your reaction</i>
<i>or the memories that would return first.</i>

54:01.541 --> 54:02.666
<i>You're a threat.</i>

54:03.416 --> 54:06.000
<i>Speak to the wrong person,</i>
<i>and it all goes public.</i>

54:06.583 --> 54:11.166
<i>General panic, chaos.</i>
<i>They couldn't take that risk.</i>

54:11.250 --> 54:15.291
I thought he was doing this to me,
that he was holding me.

54:17.250 --> 54:19.708
He didn't tell me Léo was dead.
He said he wasn't real.

54:19.791 --> 54:23.583
<i>Liz, everything… I mean everything…</i>
<i>Everything was done</i>

54:23.666 --> 54:26.958
<i>from the moment they realized</i>
<i>you'd regained consciousness</i>

54:27.500 --> 54:31.250
<i>to prevent you</i>
<i>from recovering your memory.</i>

54:33.500 --> 54:35.250
So he was playing for time.

54:37.208 --> 54:38.500
He was waiting…

54:39.291 --> 54:41.000
He was waiting
for me to run out of oxygen.

54:57.458 --> 54:58.750
Léo was real…

55:01.000 --> 55:02.291
and he's dead.

55:02.875 --> 55:03.875
<i>Yes.</i>

55:14.083 --> 55:16.000
Twelve percent.

55:16.083 --> 55:17.750
<i>We're running out of time.</i>

55:21.125 --> 55:22.333
What happened to him?

55:23.333 --> 55:24.208
<i>He was sick.</i>

55:25.791 --> 55:26.958
<i>Léo got sick,</i>

55:27.041 --> 55:29.750
<i>like millions of others</i>
<i>who were killed by the virus.</i>

55:36.416 --> 55:37.416
<i>Liz?</i>

55:41.833 --> 55:43.541
<i>No, no, no. That doesn't add up.</i>

55:44.333 --> 55:46.333
They said I went missing three days ago.

55:47.166 --> 55:50.041
<i>You've been in hypersleep</i>
<i>much longer than that.</i>

55:53.291 --> 55:54.375
How long?

55:57.083 --> 55:58.000
How long?

55:59.541 --> 56:00.416
<i>Twelve years.</i>

56:05.500 --> 56:07.291
<i>I'm really sorry, Liz.</i>

56:08.666 --> 56:11.000
<i>You're wasting your time and your oxygen.</i>

56:11.083 --> 56:14.875
<i>In ten minutes, you'll be out of range,</i>
<i>and we won't be able to communicate.</i>

56:14.958 --> 56:18.083
<i>Either you die alone,</i>
<i>or you help me to solve the problem</i>

56:18.166 --> 56:19.875
<i>-and give yourself a chance.</i>
-No.

56:19.958 --> 56:22.083
<i>-I know what I'd choose.</i>
-Okay, okay, okay.

56:25.708 --> 56:27.000
Where do we begin?

56:28.541 --> 56:31.666
<i>Okay, first we need to figure out</i>
<i>what woke you up.</i>

56:32.416 --> 56:34.291
MILO, why was the bio-form awakened?

56:35.375 --> 56:39.583
<i>Processor 3-54 overheating</i>
<i>due to loss of oxygen reserves.</i>

56:39.666 --> 56:41.250
What is processor 3-54 used for?

56:41.333 --> 56:45.458
<i>Processor 3-54 monitors and stimulates</i>
<i>the subject's cerebral activity</i>

56:45.541 --> 56:47.125
<i>to avoid cellular atrophy.</i>

56:47.208 --> 56:50.833
Brain atrophy. You hear that?
I could do without that, personally.

56:50.916 --> 56:52.208
<i>I agree.</i>

56:52.875 --> 56:55.708
<i>We must divert</i>
<i>the cerebral activity monitor</i>

56:55.791 --> 56:59.041
<i>to another processor</i>
<i>assigned to non-essential functions.</i>

56:59.125 --> 57:02.291
MILO, list all the processors
linked to non-essential functions.

57:03.458 --> 57:06.708
<i>All functions assigned to processor 694.</i>

57:07.708 --> 57:09.708
Is there any danger to the bio-form

57:09.791 --> 57:12.041
if all functions of processor 694
are deactivated?

57:12.125 --> 57:13.916
<i>Zero danger for the bio-form.</i>

57:14.000 --> 57:16.958
So, go on. Go on, deactivate them.

57:17.625 --> 57:19.250
<i>Deactivation underway.</i>

57:28.583 --> 57:29.458
MILO,

57:30.416 --> 57:35.000
transfer all functions
of processor 3-54 to 694.

57:35.083 --> 57:37.708
<i>The data exceeds processor capacity.</i>

57:38.375 --> 57:39.291
Damn.

57:41.250 --> 57:42.416
Shit.

57:42.500 --> 57:43.708
What do we do now?

57:44.291 --> 57:46.583
<i>We have to make</i>
<i>some difficult choices now.</i>

57:46.666 --> 57:49.166
<i>Deactivate systems</i>
<i>that don't have priority.</i>

57:49.250 --> 57:50.166
<i>Find…</i>

57:50.250 --> 57:51.625
<i>Too late. They're here!</i>

57:51.708 --> 57:54.625
<i>-Find a way to install a shunt…</i>
-What do you mean, they're here?

57:54.708 --> 57:56.083
<i>Return to hypersleep.</i>

57:56.166 --> 57:58.666
<i>But do it</i>
<i>before the oxygen hits two percent,</i>

57:58.750 --> 58:00.875
<i>or you won't have enough</i>
<i>for resuscitation.</i>

58:00.958 --> 58:02.958
But I won't know how to do it.

58:03.041 --> 58:05.166
<i>You do know. You have all the answers.</i>

58:05.250 --> 58:09.375
<i>Figure out what triggers your memories,</i>
<i>then you'll find those you need.</i>

58:09.958 --> 58:11.958
You designed it. I won't know how.

58:12.708 --> 58:14.083
<i>On the ground!</i>

58:14.166 --> 58:15.916
-Hello?
<i>-Right now!</i>

58:16.000 --> 58:16.833
<i>-No.</i>
-Hello?

58:16.916 --> 58:19.000
<i>Find what triggers your memories.</i>

58:19.083 --> 58:20.166
<i>Get on the floor!</i>

58:20.250 --> 58:22.541
<i>-Two percent. Find Léo.</i>
<i>-On the floor, I said!</i>

58:22.625 --> 58:23.916
<i>Find Léo.</i>

58:25.875 --> 58:27.000
<i>Connection lost.</i>

58:30.291 --> 58:32.416
Shit, shit, shit. MILO, reconnect.

58:33.125 --> 58:36.916
<i>This number is unassigned.</i>
<i>Please check the number.</i>

58:37.000 --> 58:38.916
Don't leave me alone, please.

58:51.083 --> 58:51.916
Okay.

58:52.666 --> 58:54.958
Okay, okay, okay. I worked on this thing.

58:55.041 --> 58:56.166
I worked on it.

58:56.916 --> 59:01.791
MILO, who authorized Omicron 267's
participation in this mission?

59:02.458 --> 59:07.458
<i>Participation of Omicron 267</i>
<i>authorized by Hansen, Elizabeth, Dr.</i>

59:08.625 --> 59:10.291
Yeah, of course.

59:11.000 --> 59:12.750
So that's me. That's me.

59:13.291 --> 59:14.333
It's me.

59:14.416 --> 59:16.500
A thing only I know. Only I know.

59:16.583 --> 59:19.750
"Find Léo." What does "find Léo" mean?

59:19.833 --> 59:21.625
What does it mean?

59:21.708 --> 59:23.458
What does it mean, damn it, "find Léo"?

59:25.458 --> 59:26.625
What does it mean?

59:27.666 --> 59:29.875
How do I do it?

59:30.750 --> 59:32.375
<i>Oxygen level: 11%.</i>

59:37.583 --> 59:39.833
Okay. Think.

59:39.916 --> 59:42.291
MILO, show me all low-priority processors.

59:45.708 --> 59:49.416
Okay, okay, okay.

59:50.833 --> 59:51.750
Okay.

59:53.583 --> 59:56.541
Too many. There are too many.

1:00:00.166 --> 1:00:01.958
Explain kinetic regulation.

1:00:02.041 --> 1:00:06.916
<i>Kinetic regulation delivers</i>
<i>weak electric impulses to muscle groups</i>

1:00:07.000 --> 1:00:08.625
<i>to prevent atrophy.</i>

1:00:08.708 --> 1:00:10.583
Okay. And if we deactivate it,
what happens?

1:00:11.125 --> 1:00:13.208
<i>Degeneration of muscular tissue.</i>

1:00:13.916 --> 1:00:16.125
And that's considered low priority, right?

1:00:16.666 --> 1:00:19.583
<i>Yes, because the bio-form</i>
<i>would survive the journey.</i>

1:00:21.500 --> 1:00:23.250
To die on being resuscitated.

1:00:23.333 --> 1:00:26.375
<i>The bio-form would survive</i>
<i>between three hours and ten days.</i>

1:00:26.458 --> 1:00:29.541
MILO, limit results to only processes
that can be interrupted

1:00:29.625 --> 1:00:31.791
without reducing life expectancy.

1:00:33.458 --> 1:00:36.166
<i>No non-priority processes</i>
<i>can be interrupted</i>

1:00:36.250 --> 1:00:38.000

1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:40.458
Difficult choices.

1:00:41.416 --> 1:00:43.375
Find what triggers the memories.

1:00:45.333 --> 1:00:46.666
Come on.

1:00:46.750 --> 1:00:48.958
If you have something to say,
now's the time.

1:01:22.250 --> 1:01:23.666
I'm out of my mind.

1:01:30.375 --> 1:01:34.708
<i>Warning. Any deliberate damage</i>

1:02:01.500 --> 1:02:04.958
<i>Warning.</i>

1:02:31.958 --> 1:02:33.125

1:02:45.833 --> 1:02:47.291
Don't you worry.

1:02:48.625 --> 1:02:50.375
We'll meet again.

1:03:09.708 --> 1:03:11.541
And that's our entry system.

1:03:22.875 --> 1:03:26.458
<i>MILO, search for Alice Hansen in Paris.</i>

1:03:26.541 --> 1:03:27.750

Mom?

1:03:56.416 --> 1:03:59.416
<i>Sweetheart? Is that you?</i>

1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:02.291
<i>What's wrong?</i>

1:04:03.125 --> 1:04:04.083
<i>I think…</i>

1:04:05.833 --> 1:04:09.333
<i>What? I can't hear you…</i>

1:04:11.416 --> 1:04:13.416
I just wanted to hear your voice.

1:04:15.125 --> 1:04:18.125
<i>Liz, my love, what's going on?</i>

1:04:22.291 --> 1:04:24.083
I don't think anyone will come.

1:04:26.875 --> 1:04:30.291
<i>Who won't come? Is everything all…</i>

1:04:33.083 --> 1:04:35.500
I tried to find him.
I don't know where else to look.

1:04:36.083 --> 1:04:38.166
I'm supposed to know, but I don't.

1:04:38.250 --> 1:04:41.958
<i>Why didn't you come to see me on Sunday?</i>

1:04:42.041 --> 1:04:46.958
<i>It's not good for you,</i>
<i>being alone in that house.</i>

1:04:47.541 --> 1:04:52.541
<i>I'll come to see you.</i>
<i>No, even better, you come here.</i>

1:04:53.208 --> 1:04:55.416
<i>Spend a little time with me.</i>

1:04:56.291 --> 1:04:57.750
He won't tell me what to do.

1:04:59.083 --> 1:05:03.458
<i>Are you in a car? I can hardly hear you.</i>

1:05:03.541 --> 1:05:07.083
No, I'm in…

1:05:09.291 --> 1:05:13.250
<i>What? You shouldn't call while driving.</i>

1:05:17.500 --> 1:05:18.666

1:05:19.541 --> 1:05:22.458
<i>Are you there? Liz…</i>

1:05:22.541 --> 1:05:24.166
I love you, Mom.

<i>I can't hear… what… saying…</i>

1:05:30.875 --> 1:05:32.625

1:06:16.750 --> 1:06:20.416
<i>Omicron 267 will live</i>
<i>for approximately three minutes</i>

<i>once the oxygen runs out.</i>

1:06:39.541 --> 1:06:44.125
And how long will Omicron 267 live

1:06:44.208 --> 1:06:46.833
<i>It is estimated</i>

1:16:44.000 --> 1:16:46.208
<i>-Hello?</i>
-No.

1:16:46.291 --> 1:16:47.333
Not that one.

1:16:48.250 --> 1:16:49.458
The one before that.

1:16:50.250 --> 1:16:54.958
<i>I can help you. No one else</i>
<i>can help you at this point, Liz.</i>

1:16:55.041 --> 1:16:56.833
<i>How do you know my name? I never told you.</i>

1:16:56.916 --> 1:16:59.875
<i>No need. I knew who you were</i>
<i>the moment I heard your voice,</i>

1:16:59.958 --> 1:17:01.625
<i>even though I couldn't believe it.</i>

1:17:01.708 --> 1:17:06.291
Stop. Can you do voice recognition
of the person who called me?

1:17:08.041 --> 1:17:09.875
<i>Voice recognition underway.</i>

1:17:10.750 --> 1:17:14.125
<i>Call made by Hansen, Elizabeth, Dr.,</i>

1:17:14.208 --> 1:17:17.083
<i>born January 3, 2003 in Stockholm, Sweden.</i>

1:17:24.166 --> 1:17:25.500
<i>I'm you.</i>

1:17:27.083 --> 1:17:29.000
<i>I'm you in a box.</i>

1:17:30.041 --> 1:17:30.875
MILO.

1:17:37.250 --> 1:17:39.125
What is Omicron 267?

1:17:40.125 --> 1:17:44.291
<i>Omicrons are non-contaminated</i>
<i>genetic human reproductions</i>

1:17:44.375 --> 1:17:48.333
<i>designed to propagate</i>
<i>the human race on Wolf 10-61c.</i>

1:17:56.083 --> 1:17:56.916
I'm a clone.

1:18:01.583 --> 1:18:03.708
I'm a fucking clone.

1:18:03.791 --> 1:18:05.958
I'm a fucking clone!

1:18:08.791 --> 1:18:12.916
I've never been outside this box!

1:18:13.000 --> 1:18:14.416
I'm disposable!

1:18:15.500 --> 1:18:17.458
I'm space waste!

1:18:25.750 --> 1:18:27.875
I don't wanna die!

1:18:41.416 --> 1:18:43.083
Why did you do this to me?

1:18:56.541 --> 1:18:59.041
<i>Oxygen level</i>
<i>approaching critical threshold.</i>

1:19:04.500 --> 1:19:08.250
MILO, record a message for Omicron 42.

1:19:09.708 --> 1:19:11.083
<i>Recording activated.</i>

1:19:12.625 --> 1:19:13.458
Léo…

1:19:15.791 --> 1:19:18.458
if you get this message,
it means you made it, and I…

1:19:21.458 --> 1:19:22.875
I ran out of time.

1:19:25.458 --> 1:19:27.625
I have the memory
of a whole life with you.

1:19:27.708 --> 1:19:29.416
I feel I know your laugh, your smell…

1:19:32.708 --> 1:19:35.083
I remember that
we were trying to have children…

1:19:37.833 --> 1:19:40.541
that we didn't have any
because it wasn't reasonable.

1:19:42.625 --> 1:19:46.375
But it's crazy because I feel that
like a gap inside of me.

1:19:48.041 --> 1:19:49.250
It's absurd.

1:19:50.375 --> 1:19:52.083
Because we don't know each other.

1:19:54.000 --> 1:19:57.250
I've never touched you. I've never

1:19:58.416 --> 1:19:59.458
smelled you…

1:20:03.416 --> 1:20:06.208
I know our life by heart
although I've never lived it.

1:20:08.458 --> 1:20:09.708
Well, this life…

1:20:11.000 --> 1:20:13.041
This life of…

1:20:14.208 --> 1:20:16.416
-MILO, how long have I been awake?
<i>-102 minutes.</i>

1:20:16.500 --> 1:20:19.250
Yes, this life of 102 minutes…

1:20:24.291 --> 1:20:25.750
Well, I'm on my way out and…

1:20:27.833 --> 1:20:28.666
Be happy.

1:20:33.458 --> 1:20:34.458
I just want to…

1:20:37.250 --> 1:20:38.291
I just want to…

1:20:40.875 --> 1:20:47.708
I want to live.

1:20:49.916 --> 1:20:50.958
MILO!

1:20:51.041 --> 1:20:53.875
MILO, show me
those low-priority processors again.

1:20:55.125 --> 1:20:56.333
Sorry, but…

1:20:56.416 --> 1:21:00.500
I may be genetically designed to love you,
but, in fact, I don't know you.

1:21:01.166 --> 1:21:05.208
We'll have a drink together
when I get over all of this.

1:21:05.291 --> 1:21:07.791
<i>Alert. Oxygen level: 3%.</i>

1:21:07.875 --> 1:21:09.708
-What's going on?
<i>-Interruption.</i>

1:21:09.791 --> 1:21:11.000
What does that mean?

1:21:11.875 --> 1:21:12.875
What does that mean?

1:21:12.958 --> 1:21:15.958
<i>Chance of survival</i>

<i>-Fifty-eight.</i>

1:21:24.541 --> 1:21:25.750
-Ignore it.
<i>-Fifty-seven.</i>

1:21:25.833 --> 1:21:28.250
<i>The CEP order can't be ignored.</i>

-Administered how?
<i>-Intravenously administered. 49, 48…</i>

1:21:36.500 --> 1:21:37.750

<i>Heart rate elevated.</i>
<i>Would you like a sedative?</i>

1:22:51.375 --> 1:22:55.333
You need my authorization for a sedative,
but not for a lethal injection?

1:22:56.416 --> 1:22:58.000
Are you still recording the message?

1:22:58.083 --> 1:23:02.750
<i>Yes. I am still recording</i>
<i>a message for Omicron 42.</i>

1:23:02.833 --> 1:23:06.208
Léo, can you hear what I'm forced
to put up with? I mean, seriously…

1:23:07.583 --> 1:23:14.250
MILO, which processor controls
the euthanasia protocols?

1:23:15.458 --> 1:23:20.250
<i>Processor 67-526</i>
<i>is assigned to all disaster scenarios.</i>

1:23:20.333 --> 1:23:22.416
All scenarios
where you're supposed to kill me?

1:23:22.500 --> 1:23:24.583
<i>-Yes.</i>
-Deactivate it.

1:23:24.666 --> 1:23:29.125
<i>Deactivation of disaster scenarios</i>
<i>is contrary to the United Nations ruling</i>

1:23:29.208 --> 1:23:31.208
<i>concerning the Ethics of Medical Practice.</i>

1:23:31.291 --> 1:23:33.875
In other words, if we deactivate,

1:23:34.708 --> 1:23:37.791
you won't be able to kill me,
even if I beg you to?

1:23:37.875 --> 1:23:39.208
<i>Affirmative.</i>

1:23:42.583 --> 1:23:44.958
Okay. Deactivate them.

1:23:46.125 --> 1:23:50.041
And redirect
all remaining functions of processor 3-54.

1:23:51.041 --> 1:23:53.166
<i>Deactivation of disaster scenarios.</i>

1:23:56.916 --> 1:24:01.208
<i>All functions</i>
<i>of processor 3-54 are now reassigned.</i>

1:24:05.916 --> 1:24:10.500
Okay. Launch the return
to hypersleep protocol for the bio-form.

1:24:12.208 --> 1:24:15.916
<i>Implementation impossible.</i>
<i>Bio-form disconnected.</i>

1:24:18.125 --> 1:24:20.625
<i>Intravenous assistance unhooked.</i>

1:24:20.708 --> 1:24:25.541
<i>Medical umbilical ring unhooked.</i>
<i>Cerebral activity unhooked.</i>

1:24:28.875 --> 1:24:30.958
Okay. Think.

1:24:31.041 --> 1:24:32.375
Think of the easiest thing.

1:24:33.083 --> 1:24:34.958
Does the bio-form need two IVs?

1:24:35.041 --> 1:24:40.125
<i>Affirmative. P1 for nutriments,</i>
<i>P2 for hypersleep management.</i>

1:24:40.208 --> 1:24:41.750
<i>Oxygen level critical.</i>

1:25:05.333 --> 1:25:08.208
It's going to go away.

1:25:08.291 --> 1:25:10.833
It's not real.

1:25:10.916 --> 1:25:12.458
Not real, it's not real.

1:25:14.791 --> 1:25:17.291
It wasn't me!

1:25:19.125 --> 1:25:20.333
I didn't clone you.

1:25:37.375 --> 1:25:39.375
<i>Oxygen level: 2%.</i>

1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:11.000
<i>Intravenous P2 connected.</i>

1:26:20.625 --> 1:26:22.250
Okay.

1:26:51.083 --> 1:26:53.958
<i>Medical umbilical ring connected.</i>

1:27:14.083 --> 1:27:17.416
Come on.

1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:32.208
<i>Intravenous P1 connected.</i>

<i>Cerebral activity monitor connected.</i>

<i>Oxygen level: 1%.</i>

1:28:22.625 --> 1:28:25.750
MILO, do I stand a chance
of surviving resuscitation?

1:28:25.833 --> 1:28:30.125
<i>No. An oxygen level of two percent</i>
<i>is the strict minimum for resuscitation.</i>

1:28:35.708 --> 1:28:37.625
I imagine the promise was that

1:28:38.750 --> 1:28:39.958
we'd wake together,

1:28:40.750 --> 1:28:42.750
<i>but I won't be there.</i>

1:28:42.833 --> 1:28:44.041
<i>I've tried everything.</i>

1:28:46.375 --> 1:28:47.708
I'm not the only one lost…

1:28:49.833 --> 1:28:52.125
I'm not the only one lost.
There are others.

1:28:53.875 --> 1:28:54.833
There are others.

1:28:58.291 --> 1:29:00.041
MILO, end of recording.

1:29:01.208 --> 1:29:02.750
<i>Recording ended.</i>

1:29:04.000 --> 1:29:05.166
Goodbye, Léo.

<i>Oxygen level: 0,6%</i>

1:29:39.041 --> 1:29:41.083
The others!

1:29:41.958 --> 1:29:46.416
MILO, how much oxygen
is left in the lost units?

1:29:46.500 --> 1:29:49.333
<i>One hundred eighty-seven lost units</i>
<i>are at full capacity.</i>

1:29:49.416 --> 1:29:52.791
Divert the oxygen
from the lost units to unit 267.

1:29:52.875 --> 1:29:55.125
<i>Diversion impossible to carry out now.</i>

1:29:55.208 --> 1:29:59.708
<i>Access to individual oxygen reserves</i>
<i>is limited for security reasons.</i>

1:30:00.541 --> 1:30:03.958
<i>It will require</i>
<i>approximately 14,227 minutes</i>

1:30:04.041 --> 1:30:06.750
<i>to ignore the security restriction.</i>

1:30:07.916 --> 1:30:10.791
<i>It is recommended</i>
<i>placing the bio-form in hypersleep</i>

1:30:10.875 --> 1:30:13.291
<i>for reasons</i>
<i>of preservation during the maneuver.</i>

1:30:18.833 --> 1:30:20.250
Can you do that, MILO?

1:30:20.333 --> 1:30:23.125
<i>Do you want to begin</i>
<i>the return to hypersleep protocol</i>

1:30:23.208 --> 1:30:25.166
<i>while I carry out the maneuver?</i>

1:30:30.000 --> 1:30:30.833
Yes.

1:30:32.666 --> 1:30:36.125
I could kiss you right now. Yes.

1:30:37.250 --> 1:30:39.500
Launch the hypersleep protocol.

1:30:40.875 --> 1:30:43.500
<i>Return to hypersleep protocol launched.</i>

1:30:43.583 --> 1:30:45.333

MILO, I'm sorry for hitting you.

1:31:19.250 --> 1:31:20.666
<i>Apology accepted.</i>

1:31:24.375 --> 1:31:25.958
MILO, tell me about the planet.

1:31:27.583 --> 1:31:28.458
What's it like?

1:31:28.541 --> 1:31:32.125
<i>Wolf 10-61c</i>
<i>has an orbital cycle of 18 days.</i>

1:31:32.208 --> 1:31:34.916
<i>Its mass</i>
<i>is around four times that of Earth.</i>

1:31:35.000 --> 1:31:38.083
<i>Its lack of rotation makes life impossible</i>

1:31:38.166 --> 1:31:42.375
<i>on its sun-facing side, which is too hot,</i>
<i>and on its dark side, which is too cold.</i>

1:31:42.458 --> 1:31:46.208
<i>The inhabitable area is therefore</i>
<i>on the border of day and night.</i>

1:31:48.125 --> 1:31:49.708
Tell me about the journey.

1:31:51.125 --> 1:31:53.833
<i>Once nuclear-powered thrust is engaged,</i>

1:31:53.916 --> 1:31:57.291
<i>it will take 34 years</i>
<i>to cover the 14 light-years</i>

<i>between us and Wolf 10-61c.</i>

1:32:00.291 --> 1:32:07.041
<i>On arrival, the HIVE sowing vessel</i>
<i>will break up to free the 9,568 units</i>

<i>Thanks to their individual</i>
<i>helix-shaped device--</i>

1:32:12.791 --> 1:32:16.708
MILO, tell me about the beach in Maui.

1:32:17.833 --> 1:32:21.416
<i>Kapalua Bay is a white-sand beach</i>
<i>in the shape of a crescent moon</i>
