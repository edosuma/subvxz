There you go.

00:11.219 --> 00:12.027
Thanks.

00:50.027 --> 00:51.640
An explosion!

00:52.785 --> 00:55.398
Is this incoming artillery
fire from above?

00:55.399 --> 00:59.490
No! Rommel's troops have lured
our boys into a minefield.

00:59.491 --> 01:02.792
Will the M-4 Sherman tank's
armor be able to withstand

01:02.793 --> 01:05.625
this cowardly
barrage from below?

01:06.300 --> 01:08.110
Yes, it can!

01:10.572 --> 01:14.041
And the Sherman smashes through
Nazi lines to reach the...

01:14.683 --> 01:18.092
Whoa.
That is not the Suez Canal.

01:22.883 --> 01:25.086
If you're trying to
decide what to wear,

01:25.087 --> 01:26.805
just keep wearing what
you're wearing now...

01:26.806 --> 01:29.029
Or less.

01:32.190 --> 01:33.513
Pervert.

01:35.628 --> 01:38.219
That is Field Marshal
Pervert to you.

01:38.758 --> 01:40.913
Castle, can you grab that?

01:40.914 --> 01:42.084
Got it.

01:44.065 --> 01:46.124
This is Detective
Beckett's office.

01:46.827 --> 01:48.512
Seriously? A car bomb?

01:53.209 --> 01:55.377
Talk about a heightened
police presence.

01:58.265 --> 01:59.770
Wait a minute. What is this?

01:59.957 --> 02:02.284
Something's not right.
Hey, Espo.

02:02.720 --> 02:03.926
Why are they taking
the car away?

02:03.927 --> 02:05.542
CSU's not done with it, is it?

02:05.543 --> 02:06.159
They were barely started

02:06.160 --> 02:08.234
before the feds came in
and seized the vehicle.

02:08.502 --> 02:09.828
Why would they
seize the vehicle?

02:09.829 --> 02:11.777
I tried to ask, but
they iced me out.

02:11.932 --> 02:12.991
Who's in charge?

02:12.992 --> 02:14.511
See that guy over there?

02:14.643 --> 02:16.313
Name's agent Guerrero.

02:17.100 --> 02:18.645
Trust me. He's not gonna budge.

02:18.646 --> 02:20.343
Agent Guerrero.

02:20.560 --> 02:21.538
I'm Detective Beckett--

02:21.539 --> 02:23.442
Let me save you the trouble.
We're taking the car.

02:23.443 --> 02:25.145
CSU hasn't finished
processing it yet.

02:25.146 --> 02:26.129
This is a murder scene.

02:26.130 --> 02:27.619
I'm gonna need to find
out who the victim was--

02:27.620 --> 02:30.063
I'm sorry, but that vehicle's
part of a federal investigation.

02:30.064 --> 02:31.649
And if you people
hinder us in any way,

02:31.650 --> 02:33.355
we'll arrest you
for obstruction.

02:37.848 --> 02:39.153
What the hell's going on here?

02:39.154 --> 02:40.902
And why is Homeland
Security involved?

02:40.903 --> 02:42.493
I don't know.
This whole thing stinks.

02:42.494 --> 02:43.157
According to witnesses,

02:43.158 --> 02:46.000
those two guys were staking out
the car even before it blew up,

02:46.001 --> 02:48.126
And Homeland Security isn't
letting me talk to them.

02:49.019 --> 02:50.910
A mysterious car bombing...

02:51.769 --> 02:53.597
The feds giving us the boot,

02:53.598 --> 02:56.202
and now Men in Black.

02:56.203 --> 02:58.686
I'll say it. I'm intrigued.

02:59.019 --> 03:00.026
Who are you guys?

03:00.027 --> 03:01.411
Identify yourselves.

03:01.470 --> 03:02.661
Hey, guys. You get this a lot--

03:02.662 --> 03:04.247
Agent "J," Agent "K"?

03:04.248 --> 03:05.572
Why were you guys
surveilling that car?

03:05.573 --> 03:07.313
Who was in it when it exploded?

03:11.932 --> 03:13.313
Well, we don't have a body,

03:13.314 --> 03:15.283
we don't have a crime scene,

03:15.306 --> 03:16.901
and we don't have any
witnesses, but...

03:16.902 --> 03:17.942
At least we have each other.

03:17.943 --> 03:20.716
- We still have a homicide to solve.
- And that.

03:25.211 --> 03:27.175
I think I got an ID on our vic.

03:27.207 --> 03:30.367
A uniform... found his wallet,

03:30.368 --> 03:32.395
blown about a half a
block down that way.

03:32.396 --> 03:33.467
Matches the description
of the guy

03:33.468 --> 03:34.896
that witnesses saw
get in the car.

03:34.897 --> 03:36.791
His name is Dale Tanner.

03:37.350 --> 03:39.756
I always knew this
day might come.

03:40.697 --> 03:43.488
Dale did, too.
It was one of the hazards of his job.

03:43.489 --> 03:45.920
What kind of a job
would lead to this?

03:45.954 --> 03:47.112
When Dale was 16,

03:47.113 --> 03:49.930
his father was convicted
of murder in Texas--

03:49.931 --> 03:51.380
wrongly convicted.

03:51.559 --> 03:54.152
Right before the retrial,
his father died in prison.

03:54.746 --> 03:56.702
And so fighting for
the underdog, that...

03:56.703 --> 03:58.884
kind of became his
life's mission.

03:58.885 --> 04:02.277
So about ten years ago
he started the web site.

04:02.278 --> 04:04.050
"Whistleblower Anonymous."

04:04.051 --> 04:05.366
I know that site.

04:05.367 --> 04:07.347
He exposed the, uh, the
waterboarding memos,

04:07.348 --> 04:08.791
the Orton-Geo fracking scandal.

04:08.792 --> 04:10.156
I had no idea he was
the one behind it.

04:10.157 --> 04:11.379
Dale felt it was more important

04:11.380 --> 04:14.278
to keep attention on the
issues rather than himself.

04:14.349 --> 04:16.334
Was your husband working
on anything recently?

04:16.336 --> 04:19.178
Yeah, I think he was planning
on posting some documents.

04:19.178 --> 04:21.575
Whatever they were, they
were making him nervous.

04:21.576 --> 04:22.978
Where are the documents now?

04:22.979 --> 04:25.140
Probably at his law
office in Queens.

04:25.141 --> 04:27.928
Why would Homeland Security be
interested in your husband?

04:27.929 --> 04:30.729
Half the government was
interested in my husband.

04:30.976 --> 04:33.000
After he posted those
photographs of Abu Ghraib,

04:33.001 --> 04:35.625
they... tried to get him
to reveal his sources.

04:35.626 --> 04:37.138
They harassed him.

04:37.139 --> 04:39.049
Followed him everywhere he went.

04:39.050 --> 04:41.383
It got so bad that,
two months ago,

04:41.384 --> 04:44.383
he actually moved into our
rental unit in Queens.

04:44.711 --> 04:46.962
He said that he was
concerned about our safety.

04:46.963 --> 04:48.522
And now he's dead.

04:48.592 --> 04:49.693
Mrs. Tanner,

04:49.694 --> 04:51.980
Witnesses say that your
husband parked on Mercer

04:51.981 --> 04:53.293
just before 8:00.

04:53.294 --> 04:54.868
Waited on the
sidewalk till 8:15,

04:54.869 --> 04:55.973
and then he got back in his car.

04:55.974 --> 04:58.171
Do you know what he
was doing downtown?

04:58.467 --> 05:00.115
I have no idea.

05:00.116 --> 05:02.990
He felt like, the less
we knew, the better.

05:03.633 --> 05:05.756
I should've talked to him more.

05:06.402 --> 05:07.457
Did he work with anyone else

05:07.458 --> 05:09.237
that might have known
what he was involved in?

05:09.238 --> 05:10.281
He had a partner,

05:10.282 --> 05:12.330
but... I don't know who it was.

05:12.331 --> 05:14.903
Why are we even
talking to them, mom?

05:15.152 --> 05:16.824
The government killed my father,

05:16.825 --> 05:18.862
and you're helping
them cover it up.

05:19.041 --> 05:20.817
Sean, please.

05:22.604 --> 05:23.894
Now I'm not gonna
call this a cover-up,

05:23.895 --> 05:26.857
but I will say this-- the
feds are not helping us out.

05:26.858 --> 05:28.946
They won't tell us what evidence
they found in Tanner's car.

05:28.947 --> 05:30.625
Okay. So we'll just work
it from other angles.

05:30.626 --> 05:31.798
We know that he had a partner.

05:31.799 --> 05:33.212
Why don't we look into
his phone records,

05:33.213 --> 05:34.021
see who it was?

05:34.022 --> 05:35.015
Because they're not
being released to us.

05:35.016 --> 05:36.698
Neither are Tanner's financials.

05:37.303 --> 05:38.831
Maybe we can get it
from his law office?

05:38.832 --> 05:40.192
We tried to search there.

05:40.193 --> 05:42.301
They sealed the place and
they took his computers.

05:42.302 --> 05:45.062
I'm starting to see what you
mean by the feds not helping.

05:45.063 --> 05:47.092
Then we're just gonna solve
this without their help.

05:47.093 --> 05:48.073
Where are we on motive?

05:48.074 --> 05:49.582
Well, there's plenty
of that to go around.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.158
Tanner wasn't afraid to
take on the big boys--

05:51.159 --> 05:53.340
banks, big oil,
dirty politicians.

05:53.341 --> 05:55.340
In the past year, he
posted highly damaging,

05:55.341 --> 05:56.597
and I might add,

05:56.598 --> 05:59.186
truthful information
on 30 corporations,

05:59.187 --> 06:01.355
government agencies,
and individuals.

06:01.356 --> 06:02.309
And that's just what I found

06:02.310 --> 06:04.427
before his site was
taken off-line.

06:04.503 --> 06:06.048
With no solid information,

06:06.049 --> 06:07.812
it's hard to even
know where to start.

06:08.972 --> 06:10.835
We start with manner of death.

06:11.129 --> 06:12.218
We know we're dealing
with a bomb,

06:12.219 --> 06:14.336
a bomb that was already
in Tanner's car.

06:14.337 --> 06:15.923
Right, because he stayed
near the vehicle,

06:15.924 --> 06:16.794
no one could've
tampered with it.

06:16.795 --> 06:18.864
And whoever planted
the bomb had to have

06:18.865 --> 06:21.124
access to the car at
an earlier point.

06:21.125 --> 06:22.116
Like in his garage.

06:22.117 --> 06:24.349
That's where the car was before
Tanner drove it downtown,

06:24.350 --> 06:25.463
and when I talked
to the neighbors,

06:25.464 --> 06:27.164
one of them saw an
unfamiliar motorcycle

06:27.165 --> 06:29.601
jet out of the garage
last night at 1:00 a.m.

06:29.602 --> 06:31.194
Did they happen to get a plate?

06:31.195 --> 06:32.363
No.

06:32.525 --> 06:35.082
But this traffic cam did.

06:35.083 --> 06:37.318
Bike's registered
to a Monica Lane.

06:37.319 --> 06:39.755
And get this--she works
as a security contractor

06:39.756 --> 06:41.027
at Orton-Geo.

06:41.028 --> 06:42.134
That's the fracking company

06:42.135 --> 06:44.339
Tanner almost put
out of business.

06:45.439 --> 06:48.206
Man, the camera really
does add 10 pounds.

06:48.207 --> 06:50.756
You were coming from an apartment
building garage before that was taken.

06:50.757 --> 06:51.649
What were you doing there?

06:51.650 --> 06:53.122
That's none of your business.

06:53.123 --> 06:56.482
It became our business when
Dale Tanner got blown to bits.

06:56.504 --> 06:58.296
What? He's dead?

06:58.297 --> 07:00.222
Yeah, and I bet the
company that you work for

07:00.223 --> 07:01.710
likes him a whole lot
better that way.

07:01.711 --> 07:03.828
Look, I had nothing
to do with his death.

07:03.829 --> 07:05.603
This is not what you think.

07:05.604 --> 07:07.249
Then what is it, Monica?

07:07.472 --> 07:09.529
He and I were seeing each other.

07:11.125 --> 07:12.217
Really?

07:12.343 --> 07:13.492
You and Dale Tanner?

07:13.493 --> 07:14.963
We met in the park
a few months ago.

07:14.964 --> 07:16.263
We just connected.

07:16.264 --> 07:18.659
Yeah. I can see you're
real busted up.

07:18.660 --> 07:20.430
You were spying on him.

07:20.576 --> 07:22.649
Isn't that what this
is really about?

07:24.571 --> 07:28.071
Okay, Orton-Geo lost half a
billion dollars in contracts

07:28.072 --> 07:29.433
because of Dale Tanner.

07:29.434 --> 07:30.774
My job was to get close to him

07:30.775 --> 07:32.918
and find out who was
leaking him information.

07:32.919 --> 07:34.992
But it did not
involve killing him.

07:34.993 --> 07:37.504
Was anyone else after him?
Besides you, of course.

07:38.664 --> 07:40.141
Oh, God.

07:40.650 --> 07:41.920
His wife.

07:41.921 --> 07:44.905
He said she had called.
She'd just found out about us.

07:45.385 --> 07:47.255
She threatened to kill him.

07:48.216 --> 07:49.569
I felt betrayed.

07:49.570 --> 07:50.158
Don't you see?

07:50.159 --> 07:52.684
I-I stood by him for 24 years.

07:52.685 --> 07:54.025
You withheld that he
was having an affair,

07:54.026 --> 07:55.084
and then you went
out of your way

07:55.085 --> 07:57.136
to make it look like his
work got him killed.

07:57.137 --> 07:58.668
Because it did.

08:00.486 --> 08:02.042
All right, look, I admit it.
Okay?

08:02.043 --> 08:04.964
I said some things to
Dale, but I was upset.

08:04.984 --> 08:07.078
Besides, I didn't go near
that apartment. I didn't.

08:07.079 --> 08:08.098
You could've hired
someone else to do it.

08:08.099 --> 08:09.750
With what money, huh?

08:10.473 --> 08:11.533
Really?

08:12.614 --> 08:15.770
It's not like Dale and his web
site ever made anybody rich.

08:20.256 --> 08:22.150
Beckett, there's something
you need to see.

08:26.419 --> 08:29.741
So, um... CSU sent this over.

08:29.742 --> 08:30.836
Based on what little they had,

08:30.837 --> 08:33.238
they were able to piece together
where the explosion originated.

08:33.239 --> 08:34.605
I'm gonna go out on a limb here

08:34.606 --> 08:37.124
and say the explosion
originated in the car.

08:37.125 --> 08:39.481
Right. Well, normally,
a car bomb is placed

08:39.482 --> 08:41.331
inside the engine
compartment or underneath.

08:41.332 --> 08:45.100
But this one went off
near the front seat.

08:46.253 --> 08:48.159
So it was planted
inside the car.

08:48.160 --> 08:50.541
Actually, it wasn't
planted at all.

08:50.542 --> 08:52.399
CSU found these metal fragments,

08:52.400 --> 08:55.099
and they were able to trace
it to a very specific device.

08:55.100 --> 08:56.732
They put together this...

08:56.733 --> 08:58.329
reconstruction of the explosion.

09:05.555 --> 09:06.463
Is that a missile?

09:06.464 --> 09:08.577
Specifically, the
kind of missile

09:08.578 --> 09:11.036
deployed from an
unmanned aerial vehicle.

09:11.696 --> 09:14.845
Dale Tanner was taken
out by a drone?

09:16.600 --> 09:21.599

09:28.196 --> 09:29.916
One second Dale Tanner's
sitting in his car.

09:29.917 --> 09:32.069
The next... boom.

09:32.070 --> 09:33.537
Poor guy didn't even
know what hit him.

09:33.538 --> 09:34.691
This couldn't have
been a drone strike.

09:34.692 --> 09:35.954
There's gotta be a mistake here.

09:35.955 --> 09:36.652
There isn't.

09:36.653 --> 09:39.665
CSU found PBXN-112
explosive residue

09:39.666 --> 09:42.411
and fluoridated aluminum
from a missile casing.

09:42.412 --> 09:44.386
There's no way that
a military drone

09:44.387 --> 09:46.501
could fly over New York
City and smoke a guy.

09:46.502 --> 09:47.688
Actually, it could.

09:47.753 --> 09:49.971
There's a drone training
facility at Fort Drummond.

09:49.972 --> 09:51.476
Ryan, while Castle and
I look into that,

09:51.477 --> 09:52.817
can you talk to anyone
that knew Tanner?

09:52.818 --> 09:54.692
Let's see if we can find
out who his partner was.

09:54.693 --> 09:56.461
What, you and Castle are
going to Fort Drummond?

09:56.476 --> 09:58.949
Yeah, the head of the drone
program agreed to a meeting.

10:04.428 --> 10:05.403
What is going on here?

10:05.404 --> 10:07.391
Do you really think the
military took him out?

10:07.392 --> 10:08.860
I don't see how they could.

10:08.861 --> 10:10.152
Because they wouldn't
cross that line?

10:10.153 --> 10:11.294
Because in my experience,

10:11.295 --> 10:14.157
huge bureaucracies don't act
with that kind of efficiency.

10:14.436 --> 10:15.770
Well, that's comforting.

10:16.135 --> 10:19.173
No wild theories about the
military industrial complex?

10:19.174 --> 10:21.753
I just don't want to believe my
country could do something like this.

10:22.277 --> 10:23.418
Me neither.

10:30.568 --> 10:32.377
Detective Beckett, Mr. Castle.

10:32.378 --> 10:34.231
Thank you for visiting
Fort Drummond.

10:34.298 --> 10:36.687
So we gather that you believe

10:36.688 --> 10:38.673
that there was an incident
that occurred in the city--

10:38.674 --> 10:41.400
No, not an incident.
A murder, from a drone strike.

10:41.401 --> 10:44.132
That's an outrageous
accusation, Detective.

10:44.133 --> 10:45.123
What do you base it on?

10:45.124 --> 10:46.754
Forensic evidence
at the crime scene.

10:46.755 --> 10:49.517
It's consistent with a
drone-fired missile.

10:50.100 --> 10:52.008
How many drones were in
the air this morning?

10:52.009 --> 10:54.050
That information is classified.

10:56.067 --> 10:58.275
Colonel Fortis,
was there a drone

10:58.276 --> 11:00.601
flying over New York
City at 8:15 a.m.?

11:00.602 --> 11:01.783
That's classified.

11:01.784 --> 11:03.536
Okay, how about this?

11:03.537 --> 11:05.743
Did anyone else have
access to the drones,

11:05.744 --> 11:08.103
any federal agencies,
corporations?

11:08.104 --> 11:09.459
- That's- 
- Classified.

11:09.460 --> 11:11.227
Okay, well, then I'd like to
take a look at your flight log.

11:11.228 --> 11:13.285
This meeting is over.

11:13.286 --> 11:14.421
Keep in mind,

11:14.422 --> 11:15.974
the waivers you
signed prohibit you

11:15.975 --> 11:17.786
from discussing
what was said here.

11:17.787 --> 11:19.053
Nothing was said here.

11:19.054 --> 11:21.095
Well, then we shouldn't
have a problem.

11:21.108 --> 11:22.296
Touche.

11:22.827 --> 11:25.297
That man over there.
He was at the crime scene.

11:25.403 --> 11:26.434
Who is he?

11:26.435 --> 11:27.953
Does he work for you?

11:28.149 --> 11:29.351
Don't bother.

11:29.352 --> 11:30.763
It's classified.

11:34.770 --> 11:36.578
You know, I don't know what
the hell you guys are up to,

11:36.579 --> 11:39.227
but I promise you,
I will find out.

11:47.638 --> 11:48.825
Now might be the time

11:48.826 --> 11:51.914
for wild military industrial
complex theories.

11:51.915 --> 11:53.290
And here's one--

11:53.302 --> 11:56.816
Tanner was about to post
super-secret military documents.

11:56.817 --> 11:59.498
They took him out with a drone,
and now they're covering it up,

11:59.499 --> 12:02.121
which actually isn't so wild.

12:02.122 --> 12:02.802
I don't know.

12:02.803 --> 12:05.890
Maybe they just...
fired the missile by mistake.

12:05.926 --> 12:07.380
And just so happened to hit

12:07.381 --> 12:09.656
a-a vocal critic of the
US government?

12:09.657 --> 12:11.771
And the guy from the crime scene

12:11.772 --> 12:13.536
shows up at our
kafkaesque meeting?

12:13.537 --> 12:14.382
I don't think so.

12:14.383 --> 12:16.317
I don't even know why
they took that meeting.

12:16.318 --> 12:18.601
All they did was stonewall.

12:20.204 --> 12:20.875
Beckett.

12:20.876 --> 12:23.476
Yo. Got a call from CSU.

12:23.542 --> 12:25.549
The feds just came in and
seized all materials

12:25.550 --> 12:27.123
related to the Tanner case.

12:27.124 --> 12:29.252
What, the explosive residue,
the fragment samples?

12:29.253 --> 12:31.531
- All of it.
- We've been played.

12:31.532 --> 12:32.971
They just met with
us to find out

12:32.972 --> 12:35.208
where everything was
and what we knew.

12:35.209 --> 12:36.971
And then they grabbed
all the evidence.

12:36.972 --> 12:39.755
Yeah, and now we have no proof
that a drone strike ever happened.

12:39.756 --> 12:42.012
And we're no closer to
figuring out why it happened

12:42.029 --> 12:43.386
or who did it.

12:43.387 --> 12:45.403
Well, maybe Tanner's
partner could tell us.

12:45.967 --> 12:47.020
Do you know who it is?

12:47.021 --> 12:48.669
Turns out Tanner
taught law classes

12:48.670 --> 12:50.808
at East Borough College
to make ends meet,

12:50.809 --> 12:52.288
and his colleagues said
they remember seeing

12:52.289 --> 12:54.744
a former student named
Omar Dixon hanging around.

12:54.745 --> 12:56.098
I talked to Omar's girlfriend.

12:56.099 --> 12:58.195
She said that he did
work for Tanner,

12:58.196 --> 12:59.857
but it was all
hush-hush what he did.

12:59.858 --> 13:01.390
And where's Omar now?

13:01.391 --> 13:03.105
The girlfriend said
she has no idea.

13:03.106 --> 13:04.808
But Sean Tanner might.

13:04.809 --> 13:06.239
He attends East Borough, too.

13:06.240 --> 13:07.777
Used to drop by and see his dad.

13:07.778 --> 13:08.891
Maybe he knows Omar.

13:08.892 --> 13:10.645
Oh, I think he does.

13:10.713 --> 13:11.291
You remember what he did

13:11.292 --> 13:12.803
when you asked if he
knew his dad's partner?

13:12.804 --> 13:15.098
- He changed the subject.
- Boom.

13:15.326 --> 13:17.046
I'm telling you, I
don't know him.

13:17.047 --> 13:19.092
I don't know anyone
named Omar Dixon.

13:19.093 --> 13:21.184
Look, Sean, I know
that law enforcement

13:21.185 --> 13:22.444
hasn't always been
on your guys' side.

13:22.445 --> 13:23.310
Try never.

13:23.311 --> 13:25.037
But we're not the feds, Sean.

13:25.038 --> 13:27.340
We're the guys trying to
solve your dad's murder.

13:27.394 --> 13:28.289
And no matter what you think,

13:28.290 --> 13:30.628
we're not gonna stop
until that job is done.

13:30.629 --> 13:31.797
Here's the thing, bro--

13:31.798 --> 13:34.125
If your dad was killed for
what he put on that web site,

13:34.265 --> 13:36.325
your boy Omar's in danger, too.

13:37.529 --> 13:39.018
Help us out, Sean.

13:41.998 --> 13:44.031
Yeah, I met Omar.

13:44.453 --> 13:46.196
I knew him a little.
He worked with my dad.

13:46.197 --> 13:47.294
Where can we find him?

13:47.648 --> 13:49.597
My dad gave me a number for him.

13:49.598 --> 13:51.191
We need you to call that number,

13:51.192 --> 13:53.216
tell Omar you'd like to meet.

14:00.121 --> 14:01.347
Omar?

14:02.611 --> 14:04.175
I'm Detective Kate Beckett.

14:04.176 --> 14:05.915
Whoa. Where's-- where's Sean?

14:06.072 --> 14:07.481
He couldn't make it.

14:08.426 --> 14:10.627
Need to ask you a few
questions about Dale Tanner.

14:10.628 --> 14:12.119
I'm not getting involved.

14:12.120 --> 14:14.143
Omar, you're already involved.

14:14.144 --> 14:16.181
Well, then I'm not getting
any more involved.

14:16.182 --> 14:17.977
It's bad enough I saw his
blown-up car on the news.

14:17.978 --> 14:19.344
Now I've got people
following me.

14:19.345 --> 14:20.423
And not just you.

14:20.424 --> 14:21.304
What people?

14:21.305 --> 14:23.825
I have no idea, lady.
No idea who they are.

14:24.255 --> 14:25.524
Who killed Tanner?

14:26.694 --> 14:28.363
Was it because of the documents
that he was gonna post?

14:28.364 --> 14:29.412
How the hell should I know?

14:29.413 --> 14:30.433
You're his partner, aren't you?

14:30.434 --> 14:31.746
His partner?
Is that what people think?

14:31.747 --> 14:32.769
Is that why they're after me?

14:32.770 --> 14:33.780
If you're not his partner,

14:33.781 --> 14:34.684
then who are you?

14:34.685 --> 14:36.998
His assistant.
I'm his part-time IT guy.

14:36.999 --> 14:38.852
I set up his web site.
He gave me files.

14:38.853 --> 14:39.878
I'd upload them, and for that,

14:39.879 --> 14:41.857
the cheap bastard paid
me 15 bucks an hour.

14:41.858 --> 14:43.277
Did he tell you what
he was working on?

14:43.278 --> 14:44.664
I didn't know and I didn't care.

14:44.665 --> 14:45.742
It was just a gig for me,

14:45.743 --> 14:47.545
and right now, I'm
sorry I ever took it.

14:48.855 --> 14:50.790
Don't move.

14:50.791 --> 14:52.598
That's him. That's one of the
guys that was following me.

14:52.599 --> 14:53.707
Omar!

14:53.752 --> 14:54.766
Omar!

14:57.052 --> 14:58.461
Steady.

15:00.979 --> 15:02.531
You're under arrest.

15:11.009 --> 15:14.208
He's awfully calm for a guy walking
around with a silenced pistol.

15:14.209 --> 15:16.287
Yeah, well, he's been in
rooms like this before.

15:19.311 --> 15:20.982
So what do we know
about Robert Williams?

15:20.983 --> 15:22.314
That his ID is fake.

15:22.315 --> 15:23.591
What about his prints?

15:23.592 --> 15:25.537
There's no record of
them in the system.

15:25.795 --> 15:27.089
I don't know who this guy is.

15:27.090 --> 15:28.193
As is my way,

15:28.194 --> 15:31.873
I'm gonna go with...
government assassin.

15:31.874 --> 15:33.545
Well, time to find out.

16:01.311 --> 16:02.571
What's your name?

16:03.434 --> 16:04.969
Does it matter?

16:05.347 --> 16:07.511
It's not like we're gonna
get to know each other.

16:07.512 --> 16:09.660
Who had Dale Tanner killed?

16:12.182 --> 16:13.763
Were you a part of it...

16:14.360 --> 16:16.533
or was your job just
to clean up the mess?

16:17.929 --> 16:19.569
You're tenacious.

16:20.221 --> 16:21.362
I respect that.

16:21.363 --> 16:23.305
Was Omar Dixon a
part of the mess?

16:23.306 --> 16:24.396
He went into hiding.

16:24.397 --> 16:26.479
By the way, how did you
manage to draw him out?

16:26.480 --> 16:28.010
I'll be asking the questions.

16:28.011 --> 16:29.608
You just won't be
getting the answers.

16:29.609 --> 16:30.727
We'll see.

16:31.161 --> 16:33.105
I can keep you for 24 hours,

16:33.106 --> 16:35.165
and I fully intend to do so.

16:35.166 --> 16:37.638
You have me for
five more seconds.

16:38.253 --> 16:39.657
Use them well.

16:47.559 --> 16:50.644
Beckett, you got a phone call.

16:51.294 --> 16:52.600
Time's up.

17:01.268 --> 17:03.233
This is Detective Kate Beckett.

17:03.538 --> 17:05.415
I'm sorry. What? Hold for who?

17:07.262 --> 17:09.617
Uh, good evening,
Mr. Attorney General.

17:09.617 --> 17:11.191
Yes, it is.

17:13.597 --> 17:14.848
Yes, we do.

17:16.077 --> 17:17.728
Release him? I...

17:21.499 --> 17:23.634
Look, Sir, with all due respect,

17:24.435 --> 17:27.391
a man has been killed, and
he is a person of interest.

17:29.391 --> 17:31.867
Fine. But then I'm gonna
want something in return.

17:33.523 --> 17:34.537
Yes, Sir.

17:35.019 --> 17:37.204
I fully understand.
Thank you, Sir.

17:39.626 --> 17:41.281
Well played, Detective Beckett.

17:41.900 --> 17:44.521
So... what do you want to know?

17:44.522 --> 17:46.237
Why don't we start
with, who are you?

17:46.238 --> 17:47.742
Jared Stack.

17:47.743 --> 17:50.601
Special investigator for the
Attorney General's office.

17:50.602 --> 17:51.738
I've never heard of it.

17:51.739 --> 17:52.865
You're not supposed to.

17:52.866 --> 17:54.607
And what's you connection
to Dale Tanner?

17:54.608 --> 17:55.529
Tanner was under scrutiny

17:55.530 --> 17:57.732
by the FBI, DHS,
and the Pentagon,

17:57.733 --> 18:00.312
not to mention the NYPD
Counterterrorism Unit.

18:00.313 --> 18:03.018
Somebody objective needed
to look into his death,

18:03.116 --> 18:04.101
so they picked me.

18:04.102 --> 18:06.011
When did you realize that
he was killed by a drone

18:06.012 --> 18:07.685
and not a car bomb?

18:07.686 --> 18:09.386
Once our people
examined the wreckage.

18:09.387 --> 18:10.737
Why the fake ID?

18:10.738 --> 18:12.578
I didn't know where
this was headed.

18:12.807 --> 18:14.824
The AG needs deniability.

18:14.825 --> 18:18.033
"The secretary will disavow all
knowledge of your actions."

18:18.200 --> 18:19.165
It's "Mission: Impossible."

18:19.166 --> 18:22.258
Pretty much.
I'm even wearing a mask.

18:22.259 --> 18:23.709
- Really?
- No.

18:23.710 --> 18:25.608
You claim that you have no
idea where this is headed,

18:25.609 --> 18:27.213
but it seems pretty clear to me.

18:27.664 --> 18:30.504
The military launched an
attack against Tanner.

18:30.505 --> 18:31.827
I went over the logs
at Fort Drummond.

18:31.828 --> 18:32.871
It didn't come from there.

18:32.872 --> 18:34.008
Where did it come from?

18:34.009 --> 18:35.767
That's what I'm
trying to find out.

18:35.768 --> 18:38.261
The fact is, we've lost
a number of drones.

18:38.262 --> 18:40.114
Some of 'em have fallen
into enemy hands.

18:40.115 --> 18:42.783
So one of our enemies
killed Tanner with a drone?

18:42.784 --> 18:45.166
That theory is
highly improbable,

18:45.167 --> 18:47.490
and coming from me,
that's saying something.

18:47.491 --> 18:48.655
Think of it this way--

18:48.656 --> 18:50.678
Let's say our government
wanted Tanner dead.

18:50.679 --> 18:52.487
Why not just gun him
down in the streets?

18:52.488 --> 18:54.079
Why use a drone?

18:54.080 --> 18:56.384
Why get rid of him in a way
that could bounce back on them?

18:56.385 --> 18:58.518
The same reason
most killers do--

18:58.701 --> 19:00.871
'cause they think they're
gonna get away with it.

19:05.762 --> 19:06.950
Stack.

19:08.001 --> 19:09.305
What?

19:09.939 --> 19:11.002
You're sure?

19:12.633 --> 19:15.469
All right. Uh...
send me a link to that feed.

19:15.470 --> 19:16.517
Thanks.

19:16.786 --> 19:17.678
What is it?

19:17.679 --> 19:19.484
That was one of my colleagues.

19:20.174 --> 19:21.666
The drone wasn't
from Fort Drummond,

19:21.667 --> 19:23.238
but it was one of ours.

19:26.364 --> 19:27.157
This is the video feed

19:27.158 --> 19:29.163
off a drone on a routine
training run from an

19:29.164 --> 19:31.852
air national guard base near
Syracuse at 8:16 this morning.

19:31.853 --> 19:33.720
Would you mind
shutting those blinds?

19:35.573 --> 19:37.113
Who's flying the drone?

19:37.114 --> 19:38.575
Funny you should ask.

19:38.848 --> 19:41.628
The pilot lost control nine
minutes earlier over Long Island.

19:41.629 --> 19:44.164
Whoa.
What do you mean, lost control?

19:44.643 --> 19:46.383
Take a listen for yourself.

19:46.471 --> 19:47.285
I don't know, Sir.

19:47.286 --> 19:48.840
It's not responding
to any commands.

19:48.841 --> 19:50.738
Okay, try rebooting
the comm software.

19:50.739 --> 19:52.416
I already rebooted.
That didn't fix it.

19:52.417 --> 19:53.766
Do we need to notify TSA that--

19:53.767 --> 19:55.240
Wait. What the hell is that?

19:55.241 --> 19:57.438
Are you running a targeting
protocol on that vehicle?

19:57.439 --> 19:58.662
No. I'm not doing anything.

19:58.663 --> 20:00.171
I don't know what's happening.

20:02.806 --> 20:03.839
Oh, my God.

20:04.926 --> 20:06.525
Somebody hacked into that drone

20:07.125 --> 20:08.743
and took out Dale Tanner.

20:17.461 --> 20:18.693
Why is it so hard to believe?

20:18.994 --> 20:20.738
People hack into
banks all the time--

20:20.739 --> 20:21.841
the Pentagon, NASA.

20:21.842 --> 20:22.999
Yeah, but a drone?

20:23.000 --> 20:25.172
Maybe the pilot was just
pretending that he wasn't flying.

20:25.173 --> 20:27.591
No, no. You can't fake
that kind of panic.

20:27.592 --> 20:29.937
I agree. He was having a
pants-soiling moment.

20:29.938 --> 20:32.778
But there is one possibility
we are neglecting.

20:33.422 --> 20:34.534
The drone itself.

20:34.651 --> 20:35.788
It's "Rise of the Machines",

20:35.789 --> 20:37.886
not unlike skynet in
"The Terminator".

20:37.887 --> 20:40.366
The machines have
achieved consciousness,

20:40.706 --> 20:42.208
and they are pissed.

20:42.265 --> 20:43.970
Sorry to disappoint, Mr. Castle,

20:43.971 --> 20:46.143
but it's a human
perp we're after.

20:46.174 --> 20:47.940
NSA picked up
an encrypted signal

20:47.941 --> 20:50.705
that was sent out the exact
moment the pilot lost control.

20:50.706 --> 20:52.716
That signal basically
overrode the controls

20:52.717 --> 20:54.592
and allowed the hacker
to take over the drone.

20:54.593 --> 20:56.098
And where did this
signal come from?

20:56.099 --> 20:57.763
From the lower half of
the State of New York.

20:57.764 --> 21:00.217
Uh, NSA is trying to
narrow that down as we speak.

21:00.218 --> 21:01.469
So for all we know,
we're looking for

21:01.470 --> 21:03.284
some 14-year-old nerd
with a computer?

21:03.285 --> 21:04.974
No, it's not likely.
Whoever did this

21:04.975 --> 21:06.702
had to know how to defeat
the signal encryption

21:06.703 --> 21:08.848
and have the software
to run the drone.

21:10.497 --> 21:11.635
Warburg.

21:12.650 --> 21:13.829
What's a Warburg?

21:13.830 --> 21:15.293
No, it's not a what. It's a who.

21:15.452 --> 21:17.306
He's the only guy that
could've pulled this off.

21:17.307 --> 21:18.407
Okay, how do we find him?

21:18.408 --> 21:19.735
He's been off-grid
for about a year.

21:19.736 --> 21:21.486
The guy's a real ghost.
You'll never find him.

21:21.487 --> 21:24.420
But you know what?
I might by tracing this signal.

21:24.421 --> 21:25.897
Maybe we can work
on this together.

21:28.477 --> 21:30.051
I agreed to tell
you what I knew,

21:30.052 --> 21:31.076
which I've done.

21:31.242 --> 21:32.792
It's been real fun,
Detective Beckett,

21:32.793 --> 21:35.837
but, uh, I'll take things
from here, all right?

21:37.937 --> 21:39.704
And here I thought
we all had bonded.

21:39.797 --> 21:41.206
If Warburg hacked that drone,

21:41.207 --> 21:42.529
then he's our murder suspect,

21:42.530 --> 21:45.312
and I am not buying Tack's
word that we can't find him.

21:45.313 --> 21:48.169
Let's dig into this guy and
see who we're dealing with.

21:48.453 --> 21:50.361
Simon Warburg-- a
programming legend.

21:50.362 --> 21:52.361
Overcame severe OCD to become

21:52.362 --> 21:54.200
chief designer for the
operational software

21:54.201 --> 21:55.403
used in military drones.

21:55.404 --> 21:56.142
And then what?

21:56.143 --> 21:58.541
Well, he got busted for
sabotaging that software.

21:58.542 --> 22:00.665
But he fled before the
FBI could arrest him.

22:00.666 --> 22:01.647
Warburg.

22:01.700 --> 22:03.618
Sounds like a Bond
villain, right?

22:03.619 --> 22:05.481
Petting his cat while
formulating a plan

22:05.482 --> 22:06.790
for world domination.

22:06.791 --> 22:08.628
And what is that plan, you ask?

22:08.629 --> 22:10.442
- Actually, I didn't ask.
- Talkin' to the boys.

22:10.443 --> 22:12.857
To create a drone army--

22:13.310 --> 22:18.350
a drone army... that can think,
that possess awareness.

22:18.351 --> 22:20.674
And who better than the
programming genius

22:20.675 --> 22:23.726
who designed their software to
give them that spark of life?

22:23.727 --> 22:25.965
Castle, you don't
actually believe that.

22:26.103 --> 22:27.963
And keep in mind,
if you say yes,

22:28.263 --> 22:29.713
I will find you less attractive.

22:29.714 --> 22:30.872
Well, it is conceivable,

22:30.873 --> 22:32.966
and I have to say, a
far better story.

22:33.029 --> 22:33.851
Yo, check it.

22:33.852 --> 22:36.223
Warburg posted a video just
before he went into hiding.

22:36.224 --> 22:38.574
People don't understand
why I tampered with

22:38.809 --> 22:39.979
the drone software.

22:39.980 --> 22:42.604
That's Warburg?
I was expecting...

22:42.605 --> 22:43.333
Dr. Evil?

22:43.334 --> 22:44.466
Someone a little less nerdy.

22:44.467 --> 22:46.298
It's because I've
seen the future.

22:47.321 --> 22:48.645
And I know their plan.

22:48.702 --> 22:49.907
Here it is.
Building a drone army.

22:49.908 --> 22:51.902
They'll introduce
surveillance drones

22:51.903 --> 22:53.116
to monitor traffic.

22:53.742 --> 22:55.200
Seems harmless enough, right?

22:55.269 --> 22:56.500
So we let it happen.

22:56.687 --> 22:58.473
Next, there'll be
security drones.

22:58.799 --> 23:00.546
Because who doesn't
like to feel safer?

23:00.547 --> 23:03.451
And then armed drones
to protect our skies.

23:03.452 --> 23:05.108
And by then, it's too late.

23:05.109 --> 23:06.948
Because the system to monitor,

23:06.949 --> 23:09.395
to control, to
kill any one of us

23:10.076 --> 23:11.897
will already be in place.

23:12.514 --> 23:14.648
Someone has to stop this.

23:15.469 --> 23:17.124
Even if that someone is me.

23:17.682 --> 23:19.611
He wasn't building a drone army.

23:19.612 --> 23:21.936
He was preventing one
from being built.

23:21.937 --> 23:22.754
I was pretty close.

23:22.755 --> 23:24.198
If by "close," you
mean "opposite."

23:24.199 --> 23:26.322
Warburg believed that
drones were gonna be used

23:26.323 --> 23:27.752
to target US citizens.

23:27.753 --> 23:30.216
That's why he killed an
activist like Dale Tanner--

23:30.501 --> 23:32.570
to show us that the
future was already here.

23:32.595 --> 23:34.394
This guy basically
framed the government

23:34.395 --> 23:35.889
to try to stop drone use.

23:35.890 --> 23:38.291
So we get Warburg, we're
gonna get our killer.

23:38.522 --> 23:39.888
And I think I know how.

23:40.065 --> 23:41.531
Guys, look at those books.

23:42.467 --> 23:43.589
All on science.

23:43.590 --> 23:44.576
All first editions.

23:44.577 --> 23:45.952
That's "The Origin
of the Species."

23:46.380 --> 23:47.109
So?

23:47.110 --> 23:49.242
So he was a book collector.

23:49.243 --> 23:51.060
A book collector with OCD.

23:52.063 --> 23:53.608
A habit like that
would die hard.

23:53.609 --> 23:55.214
I'll start checking antique
bookstores in the morning

23:55.215 --> 23:57.206
to see if Warburg
contacted any of them.

24:18.954 --> 24:19.866
Beckett.

24:23.576 --> 24:25.140
No tank is gonna get...

24:31.760 --> 24:32.576
Beckett.

24:33.137 --> 24:34.612
Beckett, get up. We gotta go.

24:37.546 --> 24:39.065
You totally fell for it.

24:39.068 --> 24:41.286
You acted like it was
"Rise of the Machines."

24:41.287 --> 24:42.181
No, I didn't.

24:42.542 --> 24:44.691
That's--I didn't think
it was "Rise of the--

24:44.692 --> 24:47.677
If that was actually a
killer tank, you bailed.

24:47.678 --> 24:49.569
I went to get the bat
to the protect you

24:49.570 --> 24:50.343
to eliminate the threat.

24:50.344 --> 24:51.117
Really?

24:51.118 --> 24:54.492
There's a camera here, Castle.
I saw the look on your face.

24:58.444 --> 24:59.354
Beckett.

24:59.355 --> 25:00.865
Hey, Beckett.
Sorry to call you so late.

25:00.866 --> 25:02.133
But I think I got something.

25:02.155 --> 25:04.191
Ryan, what are you
doing at the precinct?

25:04.499 --> 25:06.775
Well, I was looking at web
sites of antique bookstores,

25:06.776 --> 25:08.920
and I was checking out
one near Woodstock,

25:08.921 --> 25:11.368
and I think I've
noticed a pattern.

25:11.369 --> 25:12.527
What kind of a pattern?

25:12.528 --> 25:13.893
According to this
inventory grid,

25:13.894 --> 25:17.123
The bookseller sold seven books
on the same day last month.

25:17.124 --> 25:18.677
And I see all seven
of those books

25:18.678 --> 25:20.557
on one shelf of
Warburg's bookcase.

25:20.558 --> 25:22.975
Either that's a statistical
impossibility or--

25:22.976 --> 25:25.222
Or Warburg is rebuilding
his book collection

25:25.223 --> 25:26.264
one shelf at a time.

25:26.265 --> 25:29.434
Which would mean, he ordered
books from this bookstore.

25:33.170 --> 25:37.031
Ah, that aroma-- old leather
and moldering paper.

25:37.032 --> 25:38.121
It's official.

25:38.624 --> 25:39.661
I love this place.

25:39.662 --> 25:41.655
Castle, look.
It's "Storm Season."

25:42.362 --> 25:44.511
Oh. On the clearance table.

25:44.512 --> 25:45.967
And the love fades.

25:45.968 --> 25:47.290
Uh, can I help you?

25:47.291 --> 25:49.932
Yes, as a matter
of fact, you can.

25:50.148 --> 25:51.719
Do you recognize this man?

25:54.612 --> 25:56.353
Oh, yes, indeed.

25:56.354 --> 25:58.008
It's--it's Mr. Smith.

25:58.009 --> 26:00.022
He's quite a
discerning collector.

26:00.023 --> 26:03.550
Uh, he's purchased quite a
few books from us here.

26:04.011 --> 26:05.577
Really, Smith? That's original.

26:05.578 --> 26:07.666
Do you have his address?
Does he get his books delivered?

26:07.667 --> 26:10.586
No, no.
He comes in and he picks them up.

26:10.587 --> 26:12.088
Do you know what kind
of car he drives?

26:12.588 --> 26:15.255
Well, he usually
rides a bicycle.

26:15.256 --> 26:16.335
So he's local.

26:16.458 --> 26:17.698
All right.
I'm gonna get the boys to look up

26:17.699 --> 26:19.185
all the properties bought
or sold in the area

26:19.186 --> 26:21.363
over the past year, since
Warburg went missing.

26:22.557 --> 26:23.356
Seriously?

26:23.357 --> 26:25.442
Uh, it's--it's--
it's a nice book.

26:26.052 --> 26:26.919
Thank you.

26:30.460 --> 26:31.664
So according to Ryan,

26:31.774 --> 26:33.436
the house at the end
of this driveway

26:33.437 --> 26:36.102
was purchased ten
months ago by attorney.

26:36.174 --> 26:37.287
Warburg is here.

26:37.578 --> 26:38.543
I can feel it.

26:38.544 --> 26:39.094
Castle, you've said that

26:39.095 --> 26:40.707
about every place
we've been to so far.

26:40.708 --> 26:42.353
Yeah, but this time I mean it.

26:42.621 --> 26:44.247
The force is stronger
with this one.

26:44.601 --> 26:46.564
The problem is, it's
private property,

26:46.565 --> 26:47.873
and I don't have a warrant.

26:47.874 --> 26:49.199
Just pretend you
don't see the sign.

26:49.200 --> 26:51.484
Look, we're on the cusp
of finding Warburg,

26:51.515 --> 26:53.397
who, at the very least,
is a person of interest

26:53.398 --> 26:56.128
and at most, a
maniacal super-villain

26:56.129 --> 26:58.238
with the power to bend
drones to his will.

26:58.239 --> 26:59.120
And...

27:00.360 --> 27:01.451
Gate's unlocked.

27:03.526 --> 27:04.516
Burning daylight.

27:07.719 --> 27:09.066
Maybe Warburg is here.

27:09.240 --> 27:11.331
It is remote and secluded.

27:11.332 --> 27:13.303
You know, I just had a
deeply disturbing thought.

27:13.304 --> 27:14.626
Much like most of your thoughts?

27:14.644 --> 27:16.057
What if Warburg isn't involved?

27:16.337 --> 27:18.646
I mean...
we have been played before.

27:18.647 --> 27:20.607
What if Stack just
mentioned his name

27:20.608 --> 27:21.755
to send us on a
wild-goose chase?

27:21.756 --> 27:23.314
Oh, Castle, I don't think so.

27:23.743 --> 27:26.654
Ah, still, there's no more
proof that Warburg is involved

27:26.655 --> 27:28.171
than there is that the
drone acted on its own.

27:28.172 --> 27:30.427
Seriously?
I haven't gotten that skynet thing

27:30.428 --> 27:31.783
out of your system yet?

27:31.849 --> 27:33.557
You mock me, but mark my words.

27:33.558 --> 27:34.603
The day will come.

27:34.617 --> 27:36.460
The experts call it
the singularity...

27:36.721 --> 27:38.152
the emergence of a technological
super intelligence--

27:38.153 --> 27:39.509
Wait, Castle. Wait. Wait.

27:40.740 --> 27:41.801
Wait. Do you hear that?

27:44.826 --> 27:45.916
Like a buzzing.

28:07.533 --> 28:08.321
You okay?

28:08.490 --> 28:09.789
Yeah, I think so.

28:09.957 --> 28:12.298
Hey, that was just like
"North by Northwest."

28:12.299 --> 28:14.411
Castle, don't get too excited.
It's coming back.

28:14.636 --> 28:15.910
What are you doing?
We gotta run.

28:15.911 --> 28:17.332
We're never gonna
make it to cover.

28:17.333 --> 28:19.136
As soon as it gets in range,
I'm gonna shoot it.

28:20.843 --> 28:21.811
Okay.

28:22.213 --> 28:25.081
Okay. Okay. Okay.

28:42.168 --> 28:43.891
I can't believe you
missed with every shot.

28:44.620 --> 28:45.563
Really?!

28:45.564 --> 28:47.189
Do you think that you
shot down that drone

28:47.190 --> 28:48.765
with your marksmanship?

28:48.837 --> 28:50.383
I rose to the occasion.

28:51.062 --> 28:52.090
Wow, this time,

28:52.319 --> 28:53.698
I really did protect you.

28:53.699 --> 28:55.224
Yeah, along with yourself.

28:55.367 --> 28:57.774
You know, this makes up for
what may be considered

28:57.775 --> 28:59.124
a momentary lack of manliness.

28:59.125 --> 29:01.355
No, I have earned my redemption.

29:01.535 --> 29:03.106
Nothing can take
that away from me.

29:03.170 --> 29:05.451
These aren't real bullets.
These are blanks.

29:05.879 --> 29:06.825
Blanks?

29:06.861 --> 29:08.180
Well, I didn't know that,

29:08.181 --> 29:09.190
so that doesn't--

29:09.524 --> 29:10.994
that doesn't diminish
the act of heroism.

29:10.995 --> 29:12.437
That-- are those really blanks?

29:12.438 --> 29:14.256
Of course they're
blanks, you idiot.

29:14.587 --> 29:16.671
Meant to deter
trespassers like you.

29:16.672 --> 29:19.242
You just obliterated
my finest drone.

29:19.410 --> 29:21.567
I'm having the cops arrest you.

29:21.632 --> 29:22.980
Let me save you a phone call.

29:24.114 --> 29:25.668
We're here about Dale Tanner,

29:25.669 --> 29:26.767
Mr. Warburg.

29:28.800 --> 29:30.608
Knew somebody would
be eventually.

29:34.683 --> 29:36.568
Check out the quad.
It's my favorite.

29:37.833 --> 29:39.514
Oh, sweet.

29:40.794 --> 29:42.550
Payback for wrecking my drone.

29:44.110 --> 29:45.167
Mr. Warburg,

29:45.296 --> 29:46.771
let's talk about Dale Tanner.

29:46.772 --> 29:47.791
You want to know
if I killed him.

29:47.792 --> 29:49.242
The answer is, yes, I did.

29:50.901 --> 29:52.581
Would you like to tell me why?

29:53.058 --> 29:54.488
It began two years ago...

29:55.585 --> 29:56.543
With this.

29:57.187 --> 29:59.470
I don't understand what a car
driving through the desert

29:59.471 --> 30:01.338
has to do with Dale Tanner.

30:01.639 --> 30:03.023
Intelligence reports
said there were three

30:03.024 --> 30:05.336
high-ranking Afghan
militants in this car.

30:05.493 --> 30:06.430
It was the right make and model,

30:06.431 --> 30:07.928
traveling at a high
rate of speed.

30:07.929 --> 30:10.313
So the drone pilot was given
the green light to strike.

30:10.459 --> 30:11.404
But then...

30:12.474 --> 30:15.026
he saw those red
dots on the trunk...

30:15.465 --> 30:16.828
and he had a feeling

30:17.328 --> 30:18.765
so he aborted the mission.

30:18.915 --> 30:20.855
There were no militants
in that car.

30:20.856 --> 30:22.283
The red dots were roses,

30:22.526 --> 30:24.897
because the young couple
driving down that desert road

30:24.898 --> 30:27.009
had just gotten married.

30:28.455 --> 30:29.373
That's when I knew
I could no longer

30:29.374 --> 30:31.296
be a part of the drone program.

30:32.233 --> 30:33.550
Uh, I don't understand. Why?

30:33.551 --> 30:34.808
The pilot didn't fire.

30:34.809 --> 30:37.796
Because the next generation
of drones won't have pilots.

30:37.861 --> 30:39.511
The new AI software
will give drones

30:39.512 --> 30:41.024
decision-making capability.

30:41.025 --> 30:43.697
They'll assess the data
and take lethal action

30:43.698 --> 30:44.875
all on their own.

30:45.529 --> 30:47.650
It really will be "Rise
of the Machines."

30:47.651 --> 30:49.238
Those new drones would
turn that car to ash

30:49.239 --> 30:50.426
without hesitation.

30:50.427 --> 30:52.855
That's why, when
lives are at stake,

30:53.531 --> 30:55.335
we need a man who sees roses.

30:55.940 --> 30:58.305
We need the human factor.

30:58.520 --> 31:01.588
And where was the human factor
when you killed Dale Tanner?

31:03.204 --> 31:04.376
Let me show you something.

31:07.309 --> 31:08.727
I wrote this program myself.

31:08.956 --> 31:10.730
Note the user-friendly
interface.

31:10.731 --> 31:11.758
I'm rather proud of it.

31:11.810 --> 31:14.455
Now these red dots are
individual drones

31:14.456 --> 31:15.836
currently over New York State.

31:15.837 --> 31:16.960
Now if I click on one...

31:17.219 --> 31:19.336
I can monitor the drone's
function in real time.

31:19.337 --> 31:20.879
And with the push of a button,

31:21.324 --> 31:23.080
I can take over control
of the aircraft.

31:23.376 --> 31:24.815
Just like you did with Tanner.

31:25.198 --> 31:26.374
Oh, I was on a
bike ride that day

31:26.375 --> 31:27.469
and nowhere near a computer.

31:27.470 --> 31:29.141
You just said that
you killed him.

31:29.142 --> 31:30.859
Well, I meant my software
led to his death,

31:30.860 --> 31:32.290
but I didn't do it.

31:32.632 --> 31:34.152
In fact, I was in touch
with Dale Tanner.

31:34.153 --> 31:35.546
I wanted him to
post the program.

31:35.547 --> 31:37.817
So I loaded it onto a flash
drive and got it to him.

31:37.818 --> 31:39.214
You wanted Tanner to post

31:39.215 --> 31:41.649
your drone-hacking
software on his web site?

31:42.601 --> 31:43.896
If the Pentagon found out,

31:43.897 --> 31:46.122
they'd have to ground
their entire drone fleet.

31:46.123 --> 31:47.115
Precisely.

31:47.303 --> 31:49.552
It'd bring drone development
to a grinding halt.

31:49.553 --> 31:51.408
But Tanner refused
to post the program.

31:51.527 --> 31:52.199
He sent it back,

31:52.200 --> 31:53.718
saying he didn't want any
idiot with a computer

31:53.719 --> 31:55.805
being able to take over
control of a drone.

31:56.579 --> 31:57.747
I realized he might
have a point,

31:57.748 --> 32:00.206
so, um, I decided to keep
the program to myself.

32:00.207 --> 32:02.890
So if you didn't use this
and Tanner didn't post it,

32:02.891 --> 32:03.906
then who killed him?

32:03.907 --> 32:04.771
After I heard about his death,

32:04.772 --> 32:06.743
I checked out the flash
drive I sent him.

32:06.903 --> 32:09.303
Someone copied my
program off of it

32:09.304 --> 32:10.815
onto a USB drive.

32:11.513 --> 32:12.176
Now it wasn't Tanner.

32:12.177 --> 32:13.779
He wouldn't order a drone
strike on himself.

32:13.780 --> 32:16.229
And it wasn't anyone on
my end, because, well...

32:16.619 --> 32:17.676
who else is there?

32:17.677 --> 32:19.388
So then it had to be
someone close to Tanner

32:19.389 --> 32:21.346
with access to his work.

32:21.347 --> 32:23.157
And we only know one
person like that.

32:23.652 --> 32:26.313
His assistant-- Omar Dixon.

32:26.576 --> 32:27.708
Okay, here's my theory--

32:27.709 --> 32:29.716
Omar Dixon is
working for Tanner,

32:29.717 --> 32:31.044
but he's just scraping by.

32:31.045 --> 32:33.727
Along comes Warburg's
drone hack.

32:33.728 --> 32:35.000
Tanner doesn't want it.

32:35.333 --> 32:37.320
But Dixon sees an opportunity.

32:37.321 --> 32:39.486
He realizes how much a
drone-hacking program

32:39.487 --> 32:41.551
would be worth on
the open market.

32:41.552 --> 32:44.737
Exactly. He burns a copy,
learns how to use it.

32:44.738 --> 32:46.516
The next step-- real-world test.

32:46.517 --> 32:48.467
And Tanner's a cheap
bastard anyway, so...

32:48.705 --> 32:49.584
I'll get it.

32:50.420 --> 32:51.915
For Richard Castle, press 1.

32:51.918 --> 32:54.163
For Beckett, press 2.

32:54.164 --> 32:56.321
Yo. How about I
just talk, jackass?

32:56.322 --> 32:58.868
So we put out an APB
on Omar Dixon,

32:58.869 --> 33:00.586
but it looks like he's
already in the wind.

33:00.587 --> 33:02.235
His girlfriend said
that he packed a bag,

33:02.236 --> 33:03.869
snuck out down the fire escape.

33:03.870 --> 33:05.532
Okay, circulate his
photo to airports

33:05.533 --> 33:07.024
and bus and train stations.

33:07.095 --> 33:08.173
Already on it.

33:08.363 --> 33:10.526
Detective Beckett, I
sure do appreciate you

33:10.527 --> 33:12.616
finding Simon Warburg for me.

33:12.945 --> 33:15.372
Is that what you were hoping
for when you gave us his name?

33:15.718 --> 33:16.287
Well, I just thought

33:16.288 --> 33:18.100
you might think of
something that we hadn't.

33:18.709 --> 33:19.877
When I pinged your cell phone,

33:19.878 --> 33:20.972
I realized I was right.

33:20.973 --> 33:22.459
FBI's picking him up right now.

33:22.740 --> 33:25.593
Well, then it might interest you
to know he didn't kill Tanner.

33:26.687 --> 33:27.735
What are you talking about?

33:27.958 --> 33:30.700
We have reason to believe
that it was Omar Dixon,

33:30.701 --> 33:31.948
Tanner's assistant.

33:31.949 --> 33:33.654
The problem is, he's on the run.

33:34.162 --> 33:35.276
I can help with that.

33:37.274 --> 33:39.630
The facial recognition
system's scanning footage

33:39.631 --> 33:42.110
over the last two hours from
all the main departure points.

33:42.553 --> 33:44.484
How accurate is
this thing, really?

33:45.121 --> 33:46.806
Well, if he passed in front
of one of those cameras,

33:46.807 --> 33:47.912
it'll spot him.

33:47.918 --> 33:49.996
Man, talk about Big Brother.

33:50.341 --> 33:52.448
There's gotta be a way to beat
the system, though, right?

33:52.678 --> 33:53.640
Wear big sunglasses,

33:53.641 --> 33:55.545
let your bangs hang down
over your forehead.

33:55.546 --> 33:57.194
It totally messes
with the software.

33:57.195 --> 33:58.635
What if you don't have bangs?

33:58.636 --> 34:00.010
You could wear heavy makeup.

34:00.011 --> 34:02.304
Paint random-colored
shapes all over your face.

34:02.602 --> 34:03.863
Yeah, I'm not doing that.

34:05.807 --> 34:06.952
And there he is.

34:07.117 --> 34:10.437
JFK, International Terminal,
92 minutes ago. We got him.

34:11.091 --> 34:12.520
Now it'll track him off his face

34:12.521 --> 34:13.929
and the color of his clothes.

34:16.799 --> 34:17.746
Damn it.

34:18.313 --> 34:20.094
Omar Dixon caught a
flight to Beirut.

34:20.094 --> 34:21.320
Left an hour ago.

34:23.049 --> 34:24.003
He's gone.

34:30.661 --> 34:31.463
We reached the airline.

34:31.464 --> 34:33.904
Omar Dixon was definitely
on that flight to Beirut,

34:33.905 --> 34:35.909
- by way of Abu Dhabi.
- Why Beirut?

34:35.911 --> 34:37.924
He's got family there
on his mom's side

34:37.925 --> 34:39.063
and dual citizenship.

34:39.063 --> 34:40.922
He flew out on a
Lebanese passport.

34:40.922 --> 34:42.536
Can we have him
detained when he lands?

34:42.536 --> 34:43.902
No. There's no
extradition agreement.

34:43.904 --> 34:44.837
Probably why he went there.

34:44.838 --> 34:45.882
And it's an excellent
part of the world

34:45.882 --> 34:47.784
if you want to sell some
drone-hacking software.

34:47.784 --> 34:49.632
Speaking of drone hacking...

34:50.563 --> 34:52.402
Say hello to our
friend Omar Dixon.

34:53.525 --> 34:54.563
See you later, Omar.

34:56.929 --> 34:59.041
I thought he was
heading to Beirut.

34:59.185 --> 35:01.263
He was until I asked
the attorney general

35:01.264 --> 35:02.590
to contact the FAA

35:02.591 --> 35:04.515
and have them recall the
flight back to JFK.

35:04.516 --> 35:05.580
You know, one of the
perks of working

35:05.581 --> 35:07.233
for an 800-pound gorilla.

35:08.363 --> 35:09.884
Did you already interview him?

35:10.893 --> 35:11.833
Well...

35:12.022 --> 35:14.573
You're the reason we got
him, Detective Beckett.

35:16.313 --> 35:17.598
Why don't you do the honors?

35:34.239 --> 35:35.215
Look at that...

35:36.403 --> 35:38.163
How she uses the silence.

35:39.740 --> 35:41.308
She's a force to
be reckoned with.

35:41.309 --> 35:43.002
Oh, you don't know
the half of it.

35:49.201 --> 35:51.904
Omar, right now, your bags are
being searched for a USB drive.

35:51.905 --> 35:54.486
Your best bet is to tell me
the truth before it turns up.

35:54.487 --> 35:55.806
I told you the truth.

35:55.807 --> 35:57.761
I had nothing to do with
what happened to Tanner.

35:57.762 --> 35:58.894
Then why did you
flee the country?

35:58.895 --> 36:00.682
Because I like being
alive, that's why.

36:00.683 --> 36:03.059
Somebody put a bomb in his car.
I had people chasing me.

36:03.060 --> 36:05.669
You and I both know
that there was no bomb.

36:06.158 --> 36:07.132
What do you mean?

36:07.272 --> 36:09.454
You used the software hack

36:09.537 --> 36:11.466
to fire a missile from a drone.

36:11.467 --> 36:12.398
You're outta your mind.

36:12.399 --> 36:13.744
Wh-why is this happening to me?!

36:13.745 --> 36:16.122
Are you actually gonna sit there
and tell me that you had no idea

36:16.123 --> 36:18.100
about the flash drive
Warburg gave Tanner?

36:18.101 --> 36:19.496
I had an idea, sure.

36:19.497 --> 36:21.393
Tanner sent me to pick it
up from the dead drop.

36:21.394 --> 36:22.773
At which time, you copied it.

36:22.774 --> 36:24.123
I never copied anything.

36:24.124 --> 36:25.777
I didn't even know
what was on it.

36:26.040 --> 36:27.942
The next day, Tanner
said he didn't want it,

36:27.943 --> 36:30.334
and so he--he told me to
return the flash drive

36:30.335 --> 36:31.190
to the dead drop.

36:31.191 --> 36:33.032
So that's what I did.
That's all I did.

36:39.219 --> 36:41.057
Did anyone else know
about the flash drive

36:41.058 --> 36:42.512
or have access to it?

36:43.224 --> 36:44.266
Yeah.

36:45.411 --> 36:46.581
Yeah, just one person.

36:50.930 --> 36:51.875
Hey, Sean.

36:52.149 --> 36:53.322
You mind if we come in?

36:54.421 --> 36:55.441
I guess.

37:01.354 --> 37:02.605
Where's your mom, Sean?

37:02.606 --> 37:04.606
She went to get groceries.
What's up?

37:06.277 --> 37:07.632
Is there news about my dad?

37:07.735 --> 37:08.888
We talked to Omar.

37:08.980 --> 37:11.371
He said you started dropping
by the office two months ago,

37:11.372 --> 37:13.098
mostly when your
dad wasn't around.

37:13.159 --> 37:14.991
I like hanging with Omar.
So what?

37:14.992 --> 37:17.473
Or was it to connect
with your dad?

37:17.700 --> 37:19.575
I mean, two months ago, that's
when he moved out, isn't it?

37:19.576 --> 37:21.751
Okay, uh, I-- I'm
not exactly sure

37:21.752 --> 37:23.438
why we're talking about this.

37:23.439 --> 37:24.567
Is that why you
went to the college

37:24.568 --> 37:25.929
where he taught classes,

37:26.165 --> 37:27.407
so you could connect?

37:27.925 --> 37:29.655
I mean, it had to be hard, Sean,

37:29.656 --> 37:30.682
having a father like that--

37:30.683 --> 37:32.819
so absent, so driven.

37:33.798 --> 37:36.920
A crusader who put his mission
above all else, even...

37:38.124 --> 37:39.405
the people who loved him.

37:44.487 --> 37:48.434
Warburg's drone hack was copied
on to a 4-Gig USB drive.

37:48.435 --> 37:50.078
Just so happens you bought
the same kind of drive

37:50.079 --> 37:51.412
the day that copy was made.

37:51.615 --> 37:52.489
You called your dad.

37:52.490 --> 37:53.564
You asked him to meet with you

37:53.565 --> 37:56.220
because you wanted to know
exactly where he would be.

37:56.482 --> 37:57.853
Isn't that right, Sean?

37:59.622 --> 38:01.310
So what pushed you
over the edge, Sean?

38:05.185 --> 38:06.948
Was it when you found
out about the affair?

38:09.989 --> 38:12.735
My mom... held us together.

38:14.357 --> 38:15.720
Dad was always gone.

38:17.252 --> 38:18.631
We never had any money.

38:20.237 --> 38:22.041
We were being watched
all the time.

38:22.952 --> 38:26.114
No friends because of all
the rumors and whispers.

38:27.930 --> 38:28.997
And that was it.

38:30.108 --> 38:31.372
That was our life.

38:31.573 --> 38:34.307
All so he could
expose wrongdoing

38:34.308 --> 38:36.510
and hold the authorities
accountable.

38:36.612 --> 38:37.912
What about his family?

38:38.061 --> 38:41.110
Why didn't we matter as much
as some stupid scandal?

38:41.111 --> 38:43.573
And then, after all of it,

38:43.716 --> 38:46.245
after everything that
he put us through,

38:46.661 --> 38:48.919
He leaves my mom for
another woman?!

38:48.957 --> 38:50.242
And you wanted to make him pay.

38:50.243 --> 38:51.682
He broke her heart!

38:54.974 --> 38:55.906
Me...

38:57.339 --> 38:58.658
He broke mine, too.

39:02.440 --> 39:04.028
What is this? What's going on?

39:13.993 --> 39:15.754
How about a nice
glass of zinfandel

39:15.755 --> 39:16.825
when we get back to my place?

39:16.826 --> 39:19.694
After the day we've had
today, that sounds great.

39:19.830 --> 39:22.300
Detective Beckett
and Mr. Castle,

39:22.785 --> 39:24.583
both the president and
the Attorney General

39:24.584 --> 39:25.941
have asked me to
convey their thanks

39:25.942 --> 39:27.238
for your work on this case.

39:27.988 --> 39:29.749
I don't suppose the
president's appreciation

39:29.750 --> 39:32.638
could come in the form
of a blurb for my book?

39:33.275 --> 39:34.634
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

39:35.019 --> 39:35.890
Uh, but,

39:35.891 --> 39:37.964
Detective Beckett,
could I have a word?

39:38.696 --> 39:39.625
Yeah.

39:42.529 --> 39:43.700
Let me ask you something.

39:48.384 --> 39:50.412
Where do you see yourself
five years from now?

39:51.691 --> 39:53.455
I haven't really given
it much thought.

39:53.628 --> 39:56.490
As a lieutenant, a captain?

39:56.588 --> 39:58.762
At One Police Plaza
climbing the ladder?

39:58.763 --> 40:00.261
That's not really
where my heart is.

40:00.539 --> 40:03.418
Where is your heart...
in that room?

40:03.831 --> 40:05.523
You want to be in that
room five years from now,

40:05.524 --> 40:07.215
busting some killer's balls?

40:09.259 --> 40:10.372
I don't know you.

40:12.244 --> 40:15.064
Certainly not well enough
to have this conversation.

40:16.150 --> 40:18.021
Yeah, I used to
work Homicide, too.

40:18.306 --> 40:19.597
- Really?
- Yeah.

40:20.203 --> 40:21.242
Chicago.

40:22.351 --> 40:23.704
Till some guy tapped
me on the shoulder.

40:23.705 --> 40:24.929
Today, I'm that guy.

40:26.391 --> 40:27.541
What I'm saying is this--

40:29.205 --> 40:30.775
I think you're exceptional.

40:31.104 --> 40:33.111
You're smart, you're strong,

40:33.112 --> 40:34.950
You're an asymmetrical thinker.

40:35.754 --> 40:37.306
I see bigger things for you.

40:37.722 --> 40:39.496
Who says I want bigger things?

40:41.322 --> 40:43.934
Practically everything
about you screams it.

40:46.732 --> 40:48.712
There's a job opening in DC.

40:50.466 --> 40:51.491
What job?

40:51.501 --> 40:52.949
With the Attorney General.

40:53.505 --> 40:54.733
We report directly to him.

40:54.734 --> 40:56.286
We work with total autonomy

40:56.310 --> 40:58.365
on the biggest, most
challenging cases.

40:58.366 --> 40:59.357
Cases like this,

40:59.883 --> 41:01.055
where the stakes are high

41:01.056 --> 41:03.352
and the outcome can
affect history.

41:05.361 --> 41:07.396
Not everybody has what
it takes for the job.

41:08.284 --> 41:09.488
I think you do.

41:12.199 --> 41:14.560
Call that number to
schedule an interview.

41:16.973 --> 41:18.012
Think about it.

41:21.022 --> 41:22.049
I will.

41:25.014 --> 41:27.228
I'll be talking to you,
Detective Beckett.

41:35.182 --> 41:36.511
So you can rest easy, Castle.

41:36.512 --> 41:38.027
It looks like the
rise of the machines

41:38.028 --> 41:39.523
is still a few years off.

41:39.524 --> 41:41.430
That's what the autonomous
drones want you to think.

41:41.431 --> 41:43.349
Well, the fact is,
an autonomous drone

41:43.350 --> 41:45.439
would never have
killed Dale Tanner.

41:45.440 --> 41:46.621
Mm, true,

41:47.241 --> 41:48.994
Because with people,

41:49.162 --> 41:50.794
all decisions are personal.

41:50.795 --> 41:53.146
And where one person
might see roses...

41:53.147 --> 41:56.584
another may see a chance to
move on from an old life

41:56.585 --> 41:57.873
and on to a new one.

41:58.969 --> 42:00.181
The human factor.

42:00.388 --> 42:01.646
The human factor.

42:02.899 --> 42:04.838
And this human needs a shower.

42:04.839 --> 42:05.991
Care to join me?

42:06.264 --> 42:07.480
I'll be there in a minute.

42:08.147 --> 42:08.835
You never did tell me

42:08.836 --> 42:10.463
what Stack wanted to
talk to you about.

42:11.894 --> 42:12.943
Nothing.

42:16.082 --> 42:17.330
It was nothing.
