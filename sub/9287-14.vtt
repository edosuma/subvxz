WEBVTT

00:07.273 --> 00:09.309
Max!

00:09.393 --> 00:13.943
If we don't leave absolutely positively
right now, we won't get in.

00:16.473 --> 00:19.226
Girl is always late.

00:23.753 --> 00:25.744
My, oh, my.

00:27.233 --> 00:29.269
Can you see my bar code?

00:29.713 --> 00:33.103
No, but, sugar, the rest of you
is coming in loud and clear.

00:33.193 --> 00:36.469
- I'm done with being miserable.
- It's about time.

00:36.553 --> 00:41.946
And feeling sorry for myself. Since you
got love at the classiest club in town...

00:42.713 --> 00:46.149
...tonight we're gonna party like it's 2099.

00:58.433 --> 01:03.223
- Thought you were tight with the bouncer.
- Boom-Boom. He's around somewhere.

01:03.313 --> 01:08.990
- Thought you said he'd get us in.
- He will, as soon as he sees us in line.

01:16.833 --> 01:20.667
Oh, looks like they're tight
with Boom-Boom too.

01:20.753 --> 01:23.108
- To the Marrow, brother.
- To the Marrow.

01:23.193 --> 01:26.788
- We've got a reservation policy.
- We're the entertainment.

01:26.873 --> 01:29.433
You can't... Get Boom-Boom.

01:40.993 --> 01:44.542
- What are you doing?
- Oh, thank you.

01:45.153 --> 01:48.031
- Thank you.
- Bless you.

01:48.113 --> 01:51.742
I'm gonna see what's going on.
If I come back and you've bailed...

01:51.833 --> 01:54.586
I'm not gonna bail.
I'm here to have a good time.

01:54.673 --> 01:56.504
OK.

02:00.233 --> 02:04.021
Whoo! Have no fear, excitement is here!

02:04.753 --> 02:08.461
- Pinch me. I've died and gone to heaven.
- Off the bar, buddy!

02:08.993 --> 02:11.427
Not you, Mr Serious.

02:13.033 --> 02:16.150
Hey there, creature of the night.
I want you.

02:16.233 --> 02:20.943
I want you. Oh, I want you. I want...
Hell, I want all of you. Concubinage.

02:21.233 --> 02:22.746
Come on, man.

02:29.313 --> 02:31.031
Hey! My purse!

02:34.073 --> 02:36.064
What a crowd!

02:44.913 --> 02:49.350
Boom-Boom. Big brother.
Built like... Just big.

02:50.753 --> 02:53.426
Gets mean when his friends
get left out in line.

02:53.513 --> 02:56.710
I know who Boom-Boom is.
You have to wait like everyone else.

02:56.793 --> 02:59.102
That ain't waitin'. That is doin' time.

03:11.473 --> 03:13.703
Dude! Dude!

03:14.193 --> 03:16.787
I love your tie. Hey, can I have it?

03:22.793 --> 03:24.624
Never mind.

03:28.113 --> 03:32.186
- What are you doing, Push? You lost it?
- You're the one who's crashing.

03:32.273 --> 03:36.346
Come on, let's jack the house money
and be gone from this dreck.

03:44.433 --> 03:44.953
Just call Boom-Boom.

03:44.953 --> 03:46.068
Just call Boom-Boom.

03:46.153 --> 03:50.431
You think every time someone claims
to know him he's gonna come running?

04:02.313 --> 04:03.746
Hey! Dog-face!

04:07.713 --> 04:09.829
I got it! Let's go!

04:11.913 --> 04:14.063
No, you'll kill him! Come on!

04:14.153 --> 04:15.666
Come on!

04:19.033 --> 04:21.024
To the Marrow!

04:21.952 --> 04:24.228
To the Marrow!

04:30.033 --> 04:31.830
Are you OK? What happened?

04:31.913 --> 04:34.108
Those line-jumpers...

04:35.353 --> 04:37.867
They had bar codes, Max.

04:40.833 --> 04:45.623
They designed her to be
the perfect soldier, a human weapon.

04:45.713 --> 04:47.669
Then she escaped.

04:47.753 --> 04:52.110
In a future not far from now,
in a broken world,

04:52.193 --> 04:54.548
she is haunted by her past.

04:54.633 --> 05:00.230
She cannot run.
She must fight to discover her destiny.

05:39.113 --> 05:42.901
Please, I need help. I'm sick.

05:42.993 --> 05:45.507
- Are you injured?
- I said I'm sick.

05:45.593 --> 05:46.193
Have a seat, fill this out
and somebody'll be with you as soon...

05:46.193 --> 05:49.230
Have a seat, fill this out
and somebody'll be with you as soon...

05:49.313 --> 05:51.508
You don't understand.

05:51.593 --> 05:55.745
Honey, you're gonna have to wait,
just like everybody else. OK?

06:11.233 --> 06:13.303
Donna Stein?

06:16.713 --> 06:19.989
Excuse me. Are you Donna Stein?

06:27.073 --> 06:31.430
What are you doing standing around?
Let's go! Back to work! Bip, bip!

06:32.433 --> 06:36.267
- I'm really sorry about your arm.
- It's not your fault.

06:36.353 --> 06:40.949
Except it was me who opened the cages
and let everybody out of the Manticore zoo.

06:41.033 --> 06:45.504
You let "em out cos you figured they'd be
smart enough to lay low and blend in.

06:45.593 --> 06:48.630
Somebody needs to
smack some sense into "em.

06:48.713 --> 06:51.864
- If I can find them, I will.
- You talk to Logan about it?

06:51.953 --> 06:55.866
No. I've put him through enough
mutant mayhem to last a lifetime.

06:55.953 --> 07:00.265
Not to mention if I sneeze
on the poor guy, he drops dead.

07:01.273 --> 07:05.585
- No wonder he's over me.
- He's not over you. Not ever.

07:05.673 --> 07:07.743
He just needs some time, that's all.

07:08.313 --> 07:12.670
Which is why I can't do anything
to remind him I'm not just a regular girl.

07:15.953 --> 07:17.147
Logan.

07:17.233 --> 07:20.191
What are you waiting for?
Go call him back.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.946
- I don't know.
- It's what a regular girl would do.

07:25.393 --> 07:29.830
I told you the merchandise would be
in today and it's in. It's in, right? Good.

07:29.913 --> 07:32.552
- Why don't we meet around noon...
- Excuse me.

07:32.633 --> 07:35.511
- I'm doing some business.
- People need the phone.

07:35.593 --> 07:37.948
Just give me a second. Hello?

07:38.593 --> 07:41.107
You know what you just did?

07:42.673 --> 07:44.470
I'll forgive you - this time.

07:44.553 --> 07:49.502
Hello? Hello? Yeah, I don't know.
He had to go. Little-girl problems.

07:56.113 --> 07:58.024
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:58.833 --> 08:00.949
How you doing?

08:01.033 --> 08:05.265
So... how's your week been?

08:05.353 --> 08:08.743
- Slow.
- Tell me about it.

08:09.753 --> 08:14.269
I've been getting all kinds of earplay
about some kinda whacked-out gang.

08:14.353 --> 08:16.230
- Uh-huh.
- Revved up.

08:16.313 --> 08:19.066
And need I say it, bar codes.

08:19.553 --> 08:23.546
- Yeah, I heard about that.
- They're drawing attention to themselves.

08:23.633 --> 08:27.308
Which is not good, especially
after the close call you had last week.

08:27.393 --> 08:31.272
Rumours are still flying about how
the CDC had their hands on a transgenic.

08:31.833 --> 08:34.472
- Nice to know they miss me.
- There's more.

08:34.553 --> 08:37.828
Beverly Shankar does pro bono
at the Helman Clinic.

08:37.913 --> 08:42.509
She just contacted me about a girl with
a bar code who just walked into the ER.

08:42.592 --> 08:45.266
- We should check it out.
- It's OK. I'll do it.

08:45.353 --> 08:49.710
I mean, what's the big deal? I go in,
show her my bar code to prove I'm simpatico,

08:49.793 --> 08:52.432
give her the "you gotta lay low" speech.

08:52.513 --> 08:56.267
- I got a funny feeling about this one.
- Don't sweat it, Logan.

08:56.353 --> 08:59.311
- I'm not sweating it. I just thought...
- Got it covered.

08:59.393 --> 09:01.827
- Thanks for the tip, OK?
- OK.

09:10.673 --> 09:13.187
- Well?
- He got a lead.

09:13.273 --> 09:16.390
- So much for being a regular girl.
- I'll take you home.

09:16.473 --> 09:19.067
Hot run. 457 Slattery.

09:19.153 --> 09:21.303
Can't you see she's hurt?

09:21.393 --> 09:25.306
- In that case, here.
- Get someone else. I'm taking her home.

09:25.393 --> 09:29.306
- No, there is nobody else.
- Oh, sure there is.

09:29.393 --> 09:32.430
What...? I'd love to help
you out with this, but I...

09:32.513 --> 09:35.232
- No buts. We're short-handed.
- I really can't.

09:35.313 --> 09:37.986
- Take these, too.
- I'm late for an appointment.

09:38.073 --> 09:41.588
Get somebody to cover you.
It's no skin off my nose.

09:41.953 --> 09:43.393
- Sky, buddy...
- Don't even think about it.

09:43.393 --> 09:45.031
- Sky, buddy...
- Don't even think about it.

09:45.113 --> 09:47.786
- Sketch, my man...
- No, dude, I can't.

09:49.113 --> 09:52.423
Somebody? Anybody?

09:54.153 --> 09:55.825
Money... for me?

09:55.913 --> 10:00.145
We'll go fifty-fifty on my salary,
and the tips you can keep.

10:01.513 --> 10:03.663
Rather paint.

10:03.753 --> 10:06.221
Come on. This isn't for me, this is for you.

10:06.633 --> 10:09.386
A chance for you to get out
and see the world.

10:09.473 --> 10:12.431
I thought your kind like to take walks.

10:12.513 --> 10:17.143
OK. All right, you know what?
You can take my bike.

10:19.833 --> 10:22.063
- Bike?
- Huh?

10:24.113 --> 10:26.104
No. Max.

10:26.193 --> 10:30.152
You know, Max is a worrywart.
And she treats you like a pet.

10:30.233 --> 10:34.624
Do you wanna be dependent on her for the
rest of your life? You think she wants that?

10:34.713 --> 10:39.912
People afraid of things they don't
understand. Screaming, running, "You dog"...

10:39.993 --> 10:42.348
I got you covered.

10:42.433 --> 10:45.391
Safety first, my friend. Try it on.

10:53.033 --> 10:54.944
It's perfect.

10:55.553 --> 11:00.343
No one would ever know there's a dog-boy
under there. Here's your packages. Great.

11:00.433 --> 11:02.628
Here's your map. Don't lose that.

11:02.713 --> 11:05.785
Remember, a messenger is friendly,
courteous and kind.

11:05.873 --> 11:08.910
- Friendly, courteous, kind.
- Always get a signature.

11:08.993 --> 11:13.145
- Signature.
- And don't take the helmet off, OK?

11:13.633 --> 11:17.626
- Safety first.
- Safety first. I'm so proud of you.

11:18.273 --> 11:21.470
Now I gotta go. Meet me back here tonight.

11:21.553 --> 11:23.066
- Hello?
- Goodbye.

11:41.513 --> 11:44.232
Not thinking of leavin' us, are ya?

11:44.913 --> 11:48.462
- No! Let me go!
- Dumb-ass play, Lida.

11:48.553 --> 11:51.113
You wanna go belly-up in a hospital bed?

11:51.193 --> 11:55.709
- I trusted you and you sold me out.
- Come with us. It's not too late.

11:55.793 --> 11:59.069
Marrow is the only one who can help you.
You know that.

11:59.153 --> 12:01.303
- I'm not going back!
- Let's go.

12:03.873 --> 12:05.625
- There they are.
- Hey!

12:06.553 --> 12:07.872
No!

12:09.353 --> 12:11.469
Get the door, get the door.

12:11.553 --> 12:15.182
You'll be OK. You'll be all right.
Watch her head.

12:18.313 --> 12:20.065
Children? We need to chat.

12:20.873 --> 12:24.912
- What's with sweet-pants over there?
- Just get rid of her.

12:26.793 --> 12:30.752
- Who the hell are you?
- Let's skip the Manticore handshake.

12:30.833 --> 12:35.304
You've been naughty little transgenics,
not to mention stupid.

12:35.393 --> 12:38.112
- Maybe I should bend you over my knee.
- Oh, yeah?

12:40.233 --> 12:42.110
That was for my friend.

12:50.873 --> 12:55.344
- All that clubbing's slowed you down, hon.
- I am gonna kill you, you bitch!

12:58.153 --> 13:00.542
- Who's next?
- Come on, sweetheart.

13:18.753 --> 13:22.541
- What are you doing here?
- I thought you might need a hand.

13:22.633 --> 13:25.943
Guess you missed some training.
What're you, X-5? X-6?

13:26.033 --> 13:28.547
X what? What the hell
are you talking about?

13:28.833 --> 13:31.142
Hey, I just had it done! Take it easy.

13:31.233 --> 13:33.303
- What?
- My tattoo.

13:35.553 --> 13:37.987
She's not Manticore.

13:42.833 --> 13:48.829
Friendly, courteous, kind.
Friendly, courteous, kind.

13:53.193 --> 13:55.468
Jam Pony messenger!

13:59.153 --> 14:02.702
Oh, my God.
My Franklin Mint plate collection.

14:02.793 --> 14:05.626
- I can't believe it's here already.
- Sign, please.

14:05.713 --> 14:07.704
Here, you hold Leo.

14:10.553 --> 14:13.625
You just made my year.

14:13.713 --> 14:16.671
Now, hang on. You deserve a tip and a half.

14:20.753 --> 14:22.823
Nice kitty.

14:23.673 --> 14:25.470
What's going on out there?

14:26.793 --> 14:28.829
No tip. Keep the cat.

14:36.513 --> 14:38.583
Hey, man, how's it goin'?

14:39.593 --> 14:42.426
Made a delivery and the cat scratched me.

14:42.513 --> 14:46.028
Oh, Leo. Someone should make
chow mein out of that little rat.

14:46.113 --> 14:48.866
- Chow mein.
- Yeah. He get you bad?

14:49.953 --> 14:52.148
Pretty bad.

14:52.233 --> 14:54.224
I got just the thing.

14:55.233 --> 14:58.350
A little herb, you'll be feeling no pain.

15:00.473 --> 15:04.022
- Like Father's pipe.
- There ya go. Like father, like son.

15:04.113 --> 15:06.229
Toke up, dude.

15:06.313 --> 15:09.191
Yeah, come on. There you go.

15:10.593 --> 15:12.902
Well, looks like she's on something.

15:12.993 --> 15:15.871
Pupils are dilated...
And you're a little jumpy.

15:15.953 --> 15:19.628
What's got you all revved up?
Steroids? Amphetamines?

15:19.713 --> 15:22.386
- What's it to you?
- Where'd you get the bar code?

15:22.473 --> 15:24.703
- Why? You want one?
- I already got one.

15:30.193 --> 15:32.832
- Where'd you get that?
- You tell me, I'll tell you.

15:32.913 --> 15:35.222
No. No, I'm outta here.

15:35.833 --> 15:38.393
I don't think so, girlie.

15:41.233 --> 15:43.667
- Don't be scared.
- I'm not scared of anything.

15:43.753 --> 15:45.630
- Maybe you should be.
- Maybe you should.

15:45.713 --> 15:48.705
Why? Are you gonna hit
my fist with your face again?

15:50.193 --> 15:55.426
Why don't you be a good little bad-ass
and tell us what we want to know?

15:55.513 --> 15:59.222
No need. You'll find that out
from Marrow when he comes for me.

15:59.313 --> 16:01.269
Marrow? Who the hell is Marrow?

16:12.553 --> 16:15.113
Tell me about this firecracker
you ran into.

16:15.553 --> 16:18.545
She wasn't normal.
She was amped up on something.

16:18.633 --> 16:22.945
She took out Rain in, like, two seconds
and said something about...

16:24.393 --> 16:27.351
What, mantle-something? Push?

16:27.433 --> 16:30.630
Yeah, yeah, it was, um... Manticore.

16:34.273 --> 16:36.309
Whatever.

16:39.433 --> 16:43.108
They were helping you. Taking care of you.

16:43.793 --> 16:46.307
And now we lost Rain.

16:46.993 --> 16:51.145
I made a mistake. I know that now.

16:51.233 --> 16:54.589
I just wanted to try and make it on my own.

16:57.353 --> 16:59.344
I'm sorry.

17:04.233 --> 17:06.223
You're sorry?

17:11.752 --> 17:13.823
She's sorry.

17:17.313 --> 17:19.463
Let me ask you something.

17:19.553 --> 17:24.468
What were you before I gave you this
incredible life that you're leading now?

17:25.153 --> 17:27.791
- I don't know.
- What?

17:29.153 --> 17:31.303
I didn't quite catch that.

17:32.233 --> 17:33.985
I was ordinary.

17:36.753 --> 17:38.744
Ordinary?

17:39.833 --> 17:44.224
Lida, darling, you were a shadow.

17:44.913 --> 17:49.589
You were the grass that's too close to a fence
to be cut, or the water in an abandoned tyre!

17:49.673 --> 17:52.187
- Please, I hurt.
- Ordinary?

17:53.753 --> 17:55.823
You weren't even close.

17:55.913 --> 17:59.792
And then I made you strong.
I made you special.

17:59.873 --> 18:02.228
It is a world gone Darwin out there, baby,

18:02.313 --> 18:06.750
and I jacked you up into
the Tribe of the Alive. All of you!

18:12.873 --> 18:15.865
And... you betrayed me.

18:16.833 --> 18:20.348
- I need to sip.
- Of course you do.

18:24.393 --> 18:28.306
I told you. I told you that
this was for ever, didn't I?

18:30.433 --> 18:32.185
Look at you.

18:33.633 --> 18:39.105
You know what the shaking means.
Even if I helped you, you know it's too late.

18:39.193 --> 18:40.990
Please...

18:42.113 --> 18:44.468
make it stop.

18:48.553 --> 18:51.192
I wish I could.

18:56.033 --> 18:58.308
No, please!

19:08.753 --> 19:10.903
May I live my life to the Marrow...

19:10.993 --> 19:12.870
This is just great.

19:12.953 --> 19:15.706
Hey, hey! You OK?

19:16.353 --> 19:19.470
- You gotta let me go.
- Tell me about the bar code.

19:19.553 --> 19:23.068
- We only got them to be like him.
- Like who? This Marrow guy?

19:23.153 --> 19:24.791
I gotta go back, please.

19:24.873 --> 19:29.185
So you're going through some kind
of withdrawal. She's burning up.

19:29.713 --> 19:33.786
Get her jacket off. I'll call Shankar,
see if she can take a look at her.

19:33.873 --> 19:38.071
- May I live my life to the Marrow...
- Come on, arms out.

19:38.153 --> 19:40.508
What are you on?

19:41.793 --> 19:45.388
May I live life to the Marrow...
Strive, reach, take...

19:49.153 --> 19:51.144
She's on her way.

19:53.233 --> 19:55.144
Keep an eye on her. I'm gonna go.

19:55.233 --> 19:57.793
- Where?
- To church.

19:59.833 --> 20:02.108
- Guys, hey.
- Hey.

20:02.193 --> 20:09.065
OK, Josh, this is Kurt.
This is Josh. He works over at Jam Pony.

20:09.153 --> 20:13.510
Sit down, man. You're, like, eight feet tall,
dude. You're freakin' me out.

20:13.593 --> 20:15.345
You hungry, mystery man?

20:15.433 --> 20:18.709
Hungry... like, a lot, dude.

20:19.913 --> 20:22.347
Great. We got some buffalo wings coming.

20:22.433 --> 20:25.231
- Buffalo wings?
- Chicken wings.

20:27.393 --> 20:31.705
Chicken with... buffalo in his cocktail.

20:33.633 --> 20:36.386
Want some pretzels while we wait?

20:52.753 --> 20:54.903
You're all right, Josh.

21:12.393 --> 21:14.861
You brought this on yourself.

21:17.433 --> 21:21.142
- I don't wanna die.
- You should've thought about that before.

21:24.153 --> 21:26.144
I'm begging you.

21:26.233 --> 21:28.508
I'm not a cruel man.

21:29.793 --> 21:32.512
It pains me to see you suffer.

21:35.233 --> 21:37.383
Relief is here.

22:01.993 --> 22:04.029
She was our sister.

22:04.113 --> 22:06.104
Beautiful...

22:06.193 --> 22:07.990
devoted...

22:08.073 --> 22:09.506
passionate.

22:10.193 --> 22:12.866
A promiscuous advocate of mischief.

22:22.913 --> 22:29.227
It didn't have to end like this.
Her death... was senseless.

22:31.913 --> 22:36.191
She knew the covenant.
She knew what we all know:

22:36.273 --> 22:37.831
That this...

22:39.433 --> 22:41.185
this is for ever.

22:44.593 --> 22:46.584
So she left...

22:48.233 --> 22:51.270
knowing that she couldn't
survive without this.

23:22.553 --> 23:26.307
You've all found what
everyone else is searching for:

23:26.393 --> 23:29.863
Strength in a fear-stricken world.

23:37.593 --> 23:39.868
And I've found you.

23:57.633 --> 24:00.989
- What are you doing here?
- I came to light a candle.

24:01.073 --> 24:03.143
This isn't your business.

24:03.233 --> 24:06.031
You're Manticore.
That makes it my business.

24:06.113 --> 24:08.069
What's your deal, anyway?

24:08.153 --> 24:10.144
What's my deal?

24:11.793 --> 24:15.752
I'm the Red Cross.
I'm the mother of all blood brothers.

24:15.833 --> 24:18.028
I'm the Bank of Sangria.

24:18.113 --> 24:21.992
Manticore gave you the perfect body.
They gave me the perfect blood.

24:22.073 --> 24:24.633
Please. We're all universal donors.

24:25.593 --> 24:30.064
Please. That tap water you got in there?
Uh-uh. No, this is the high-test stuff,

24:30.153 --> 24:34.863
chock full of endorphins and coagulants
and all sorts of feel-good enzymes.

24:34.953 --> 24:38.912
And you got those kids hooked on it.
They don't know who you really are.

24:38.993 --> 24:42.303
They think you're
some kind of holy vampire.

24:42.393 --> 24:45.351
They know what I give them.

24:45.433 --> 24:50.109
Temperament, vida... life.

24:50.193 --> 24:53.981
Oh, really? What about that poor girl
out there on the bench?

24:54.073 --> 24:57.748
There is no out! She knew that!
I am the only out!

25:01.153 --> 25:02.950
Gods.

25:03.633 --> 25:05.589
I make them gods.

25:05.673 --> 25:10.349
They get a taste of superiority,
of what it means to be like... us.

25:10.433 --> 25:10.713
Us?

25:10.713 --> 25:12.066
Us?

25:12.153 --> 25:14.826
Miss... I'm sorry, I never got your name.

25:14.913 --> 25:17.222
Kiss my ass.

25:17.313 --> 25:20.544
You're cute. You're also a freak.

25:20.633 --> 25:25.787
You are a mutant with tangled genetics
and a bar code, just like me.

25:25.873 --> 25:30.708
The only difference between you and me
is that you're still hunted...

25:30.793 --> 25:33.261
and I'm in demand.

25:34.113 --> 25:36.786
You are fooling yourself.
You think you can hide.

25:36.873 --> 25:40.422
Sooner or later the world
will realise that we are out there.

25:40.513 --> 25:43.186
And that we are better than they are.

25:43.273 --> 25:48.267
The time will come when they will declare
war on our kind, and when they do...

25:49.953 --> 25:53.502
I'm gonna have my own private army
to protect me.

25:54.873 --> 25:58.309
See, those kids out there,
they would do anything for me.

25:58.393 --> 26:00.668
Fight. Kill.

26:01.873 --> 26:04.068
Even die.

26:06.113 --> 26:08.422
They love me.

26:08.513 --> 26:10.026
Love you?

26:10.113 --> 26:14.265
Well, they can't live without me.
Isn't that the same thing?

26:19.313 --> 26:24.546
Now, I really should kill you,
but I want my Rain back.

26:24.633 --> 26:29.946
So I'm going to let you go
and hope that you send her back to me,

26:30.033 --> 26:33.912
because if you don't... she'll die.

26:36.273 --> 26:40.232
You can spin that any bloody way
you want, but at the end of the day...

26:41.673 --> 26:44.267
whose fault will that be?

26:45.513 --> 26:47.344
Get out.

26:54.153 --> 26:57.748
- Where'd you say you came from, J-man?
- Basement.

26:57.833 --> 26:59.949
Basement!

27:01.353 --> 27:07.383
I dig you, J-man. I dig your scene.
You are, like, worldwide, man.

27:09.633 --> 27:13.182
- You got a hottie stashed somewhere?
- Hottie?

27:13.273 --> 27:17.152
A girl. You know, a little friend.

27:17.233 --> 27:20.509
Friend. Uh, Max and Cindy friend.

27:20.593 --> 27:22.788
Two? You dog, you!

27:24.073 --> 27:27.065
Doggie's got a kennel club
and you're not invited.

27:27.153 --> 27:29.826
No, everyone invited to J-man.

27:31.673 --> 27:34.233
My hero. My big dog.

27:35.593 --> 27:38.107
Josh... Joshua dog.

27:46.793 --> 27:48.624
Messengers rock!

27:48.713 --> 27:52.945
- Tell it, doggie.
- Friends, they like the doggie-dog.

27:53.713 --> 27:57.103
- Solid, baby-J, solid!
- We love you, Josh.

28:12.793 --> 28:16.069
- Joshua dog-boy.
- A-freakin'-men. Joshua dog...

28:30.993 --> 28:34.383
His blood? That's what they're amped on?

28:34.473 --> 28:39.672
What can I say? Once you've had
transgenic, you never go back.

28:41.753 --> 28:46.383
- The girl at the hospital?
- She didn't make it.

28:46.473 --> 28:48.225
Oh! It burns!

28:54.193 --> 28:58.709
She's postictal. Her heartbeat's
arrhythmic, cardiac output weak.

28:58.793 --> 29:00.624
We gotta do something.

29:00.713 --> 29:03.910
At this rate, she might not
survive the night.

29:03.993 --> 29:07.065
This is one of those
that I've never seen before.

29:07.153 --> 29:10.753
Oh, please...
Please, you've gotta help me.

29:10.753 --> 29:11.265
Oh, please...
Please, you've gotta help me.

29:11.353 --> 29:14.550
- We're doing everything we can.
- I'll die without his blood.

29:14.633 --> 29:16.942
It's not too late. Just take me to him.

29:17.033 --> 29:19.752
It's not too late? How do you know?

29:19.833 --> 29:23.906
He told us. Marrow. Up front.
He tells everyone up front.

29:23.993 --> 29:26.632
Once the shaking starts, you're gone.

29:43.393 --> 29:47.432
I can't believe I let something
like him out there in the world.

29:48.433 --> 29:51.823
- You didn't know.
- It's sick. The whole thing is sick.

29:54.793 --> 29:57.990
It's no use. There's nothing we can do.

30:01.233 --> 30:03.224
I'll take her back.

30:03.313 --> 30:06.225
Thanks. I just can't look at that guy again.

30:11.633 --> 30:14.227
I'm going to Joshua's.

30:17.553 --> 30:19.987
Yeah, I cleared, like, two grand on the deal.

30:20.073 --> 30:23.031
- Well, if it isn't God's gift to messengers.
- What's up?

30:23.113 --> 30:25.707
I said God's gift, not God's blunder, moron.

30:25.793 --> 30:29.991
I got three people who called
to say they didn't get their packages.

30:30.073 --> 30:33.065
- No, that can't be.
- Let me see your signatures.

30:33.153 --> 30:34.552
Yeah...

30:38.633 --> 30:40.669
Where's my clipboard?

30:40.753 --> 30:43.665
Where's my clip... I left it at my last run.

30:43.753 --> 30:48.031
You people would lose an intestine if
it wasn't attached. Go get your clipboard.

30:48.113 --> 30:51.344
- On it.
- Bip, bip, bip, bip!

30:54.913 --> 30:58.189
Joshua. Where the hell have you been?

30:58.273 --> 31:00.070
Are you OK? Are you hurt?

31:02.153 --> 31:04.713
Dudeheads said they were cool,
but they weren't.

31:04.793 --> 31:09.503
- I don't understand.
- Tried to go outside with outside people.

31:09.593 --> 31:13.188
- Made delivery for Alec.
- What? Alec?

31:16.433 --> 31:19.152
Have you been smoking?

31:19.233 --> 31:21.513
Got baked with dudeheads.

31:21.513 --> 31:22.104
Got baked with dudeheads.

31:22.793 --> 31:24.624
Ate winged buffaloes.

31:24.713 --> 31:28.945
"My hero, my hero." Lying hottie!

31:30.033 --> 31:33.708
These dudeheads... Did any
of them try to follow you home?

31:33.793 --> 31:36.591
No. No.

31:39.993 --> 31:41.312
It's OK.

31:45.873 --> 31:50.583
So what's her problem, anyway?
She's special, like Marrow.

31:50.953 --> 31:54.946
They're the same, except she's
just trying to ruin what we have.

31:55.033 --> 31:57.024
Not quite.

31:57.113 --> 32:01.311
She's just jealous of him
because we love him and he cares for us.

32:02.193 --> 32:05.230
Rain, he owns you.

32:05.313 --> 32:08.111
He made me better than I was.

32:08.193 --> 32:14.143
So you think he's special, then?
He's born to some kind of glorious destiny?

32:14.233 --> 32:15.871
What do you know?

32:15.953 --> 32:21.152
I do know he was genetically engineered
by a government agency called Manticore.

32:21.233 --> 32:23.701
They designed him in a lab.

32:23.793 --> 32:25.873
And they brainwashed him with the same
kind of lies he's been using on you.

32:25.873 --> 32:28.307
And they brainwashed him with the same
kind of lies he's been using on you.

32:28.393 --> 32:31.590
- That you don't exist apart from the family.
- I don't believe it.

32:31.673 --> 32:34.551
But he believed it. They all did.

32:34.633 --> 32:37.705
Except for Max and eleven
of her brothers and sisters.

32:37.793 --> 32:40.591
They wanted out so much they escaped.

32:40.673 --> 32:44.348
They've spent years defending
their freedom with their lives.

32:44.433 --> 32:47.664
That bar code on the back of their necks,

32:47.753 --> 32:51.189
that was put there
to keep track of 'em, like a brand.

32:51.273 --> 32:56.745
So when she sees someone like you,
eager to be a slave, wearing it,

32:56.833 --> 32:59.142
it kills her inside.

33:01.873 --> 33:06.230
And you think they're the same.
Well, I don't.

33:10.793 --> 33:13.148
It's up here in the middle of the block.

33:18.513 --> 33:21.550
Good luck. You're gonna need it.

33:21.633 --> 33:24.864
Yeah. You know, even
if I wanted out, I can't leave.

33:24.953 --> 33:29.265
You said so yourself. He owns us.

33:43.313 --> 33:47.591
What happened to the good ol' happy
Joshua we all know and love?

33:47.673 --> 33:52.224
Should've listened to Max. "People
scared of things that are different."

33:52.313 --> 33:54.781
I know, but you didn't...

33:56.233 --> 33:59.987
Joshua definitely different.
Not meant to be with outside people.

34:00.073 --> 34:01.142
It's OK.

34:01.233 --> 34:05.909
I thought they would understand. So I took
off my helmet, and they didn't understand.

34:05.993 --> 34:09.349
Max, they were just like "Agh! Agh!"

34:09.433 --> 34:13.027
"Oh, my God, dude, look at him!
He's got a dog face!"

34:13.112 --> 34:17.629
"I'm tripping! Are you tripping?
Sorry, sorry... I'm tripping! Oh, my God!"

34:17.713 --> 34:20.431
It's all right. It's over, it's over.

34:20.513 --> 34:23.949
It's OK. It's OK. It's all over, OK?

34:24.033 --> 34:27.661
- Hey, guys. What's going on?
- My head is gonna fly off.

34:28.033 --> 34:30.501
- He's stoned.
- Father's pipe.

34:30.592 --> 34:33.551
Some idiots pumped him full of weed.

34:35.753 --> 34:38.266
See? Safety first, right?

34:39.152 --> 34:42.065
Kind, courteous, friendly. Signatures.

34:48.513 --> 34:50.947
- Bad Leo!
- Joshua, Joshua, listen to me.

34:51.592 --> 34:54.869
It's just the drugs.
It's just the effect of the drugs.

34:56.233 --> 34:59.987
Joshua not worldwide. That's not the plan!

35:00.073 --> 35:02.382
I know. That is not the plan, is it?

35:02.473 --> 35:06.261
Flying buffaloes inside my stomach. It's...

35:06.353 --> 35:09.902
Joshua, it's all inside your head.

35:14.273 --> 35:18.551
Flying buffaloes inside... inside my head.

35:18.633 --> 35:21.784
All of this is just inside your head.

35:21.873 --> 35:23.386
Just take me to him.

35:23.473 --> 35:26.590
There is no out! I am the only out!

35:26.673 --> 35:29.710
It didn't have to end like this.
This is for ever.

35:29.793 --> 35:31.226
I'll die without his blood.

35:31.313 --> 35:32.951
Whose fault will it be?

35:35.113 --> 35:36.990
I gotta go.

35:38.793 --> 35:41.261
Sweetheart, did the shaking start yet?

35:43.833 --> 35:45.869
Thank God, there's still time.

35:45.953 --> 35:48.865
Don't be afraid. You're here.

35:48.953 --> 35:51.342
You made it back to us, and I can save you.

35:59.913 --> 36:02.143
Now sip, Rain.

36:02.553 --> 36:03.588
He owns you.

36:05.313 --> 36:07.463
Sip your troubles away.

36:09.113 --> 36:10.387
They designed him in a lab.

36:12.353 --> 36:15.390
Rain, come on.

36:15.473 --> 36:17.509
I'm... I'm shaking.

36:17.593 --> 36:21.871
Rain, you are going to die
if you don't let me save you.

36:21.953 --> 36:23.864
Sip. Now.

36:25.433 --> 36:28.231
They brainwashed him
with the same lies he used on you.

36:30.713 --> 36:32.704
Rain!

36:33.873 --> 36:35.909
Rain, sip, please.

36:44.913 --> 36:48.588
No. I don't want to.

36:53.073 --> 36:55.746
You lied to us.

37:03.873 --> 37:09.470
- So you found out my little secret.
- Oh, please... Please just let me go.

37:09.993 --> 37:15.021
I wish I could.
I mean, you're a real kick to have around.

37:15.833 --> 37:19.109
But I have a tactical imperative here.

37:19.433 --> 37:22.231
- What if you tell the others?
- I won't. I won't.

37:22.313 --> 37:24.349
- But you will.
- No, I won't.

37:24.753 --> 37:27.028
You will.

37:27.113 --> 37:29.433
There's nothing worse than a nagging
conscience. You know what I mean?

37:29.433 --> 37:31.424
There's nothing worse than a nagging
conscience. You know what I mean?

37:31.513 --> 37:33.265
I'm sorry.

37:42.033 --> 37:43.432
Oh, hello.

37:43.513 --> 37:47.392
You should whip up another batch
of plasma milkshakes for these guys.

37:47.473 --> 37:50.829
You don't look like a happy vampire.
What'd you do with Rain?

37:50.913 --> 37:53.711
Be more concerned with
what I'm going to do to you.

37:54.033 --> 37:55.910
Bring it on.

38:04.393 --> 38:07.544
Stop! You guys,
he's totally been lying to us!

38:07.633 --> 38:10.101
- Rain.
- We don't need him.

38:11.433 --> 38:14.231
- What is she talking about?
- He tried to kill me.

38:14.313 --> 38:17.032
- That is enough.
- Because I found out the truth.

38:17.113 --> 38:18.466
Shut up!

38:18.553 --> 38:22.182
Rain, I told you that it was for ever,
and I meant it.

38:22.273 --> 38:24.582
You guys, it's all a lie.

38:24.673 --> 38:26.550
Ungrateful little bitch.

38:52.233 --> 38:54.906
- You all right?
- He's dead.

38:54.993 --> 38:56.870
So are we.

38:57.313 --> 38:59.873
- Now we're all gonna die.
- No, you're not.

39:00.353 --> 39:03.390
- It's true.
- No, he told us this was for ever.

39:03.473 --> 39:05.191
- He lied.
- How do you know?

39:05.273 --> 39:07.628
- Because I didn't sip.
- What do you mean?

39:07.713 --> 39:10.386
I didn't sip.
And I made it through without him.

39:10.473 --> 39:12.304
What about Lida?

39:12.393 --> 39:17.387
He killed Lida because he wanted
you guys to think you'd die without him.

39:20.313 --> 39:23.225
You're gonna be OK. All of you.

39:25.553 --> 39:27.509
Thanks.

39:28.113 --> 39:31.150
You know, he told me about you.

39:31.753 --> 39:34.506
- Who?
- Your friend.

39:34.593 --> 39:37.903
Must be nice to have somebody like that.

39:37.993 --> 39:40.791
And, you know, he's right.

39:41.313 --> 39:43.588
You're nothing like him.

39:56.313 --> 40:00.226
Rise and shine, big fella. It's a new day.

40:06.273 --> 40:09.948
New day, same problems.

40:10.033 --> 40:13.070
Not for Alec, especially
when I get my hands on him.

40:13.153 --> 40:15.144
Whack, whack.

40:17.153 --> 40:19.144
Hey, cheer up.

40:20.393 --> 40:23.703
Joshua sees life go by through window.

40:23.793 --> 40:27.502
Life looks back and screams at Joshua.

40:33.433 --> 40:36.584
I know who you are. I love who you are.

40:37.793 --> 40:41.342
And that matters. At least, I hope it does.

40:44.513 --> 40:47.425
- Max is worldwide.
- What?

40:50.313 --> 40:52.144
It matters.

40:57.713 --> 41:00.147
It's Logan. It's urgent.

41:00.233 --> 41:02.189
Thank you.

41:02.593 --> 41:04.823
- Go.
- You sure?

41:07.353 --> 41:08.945
OK.

41:17.313 --> 41:21.386
- What happened? What's up?
- Up is right. The thing flies.

41:21.473 --> 41:23.862
- What flies?
- Another creature.

41:23.953 --> 41:25.864
- Oh, no.
- Yep.

41:25.953 --> 41:29.787
Wingspan of a jet.
The thing breathes fire, titanium claws,

41:29.873 --> 41:33.752
some kind of screeching thing
that makes people's heads explode...

41:36.313 --> 41:41.228
I just thought you'd wanna know about
the group. Shankar says they're in the clear.

41:41.313 --> 41:44.908
- That's good.
- We don't have to worry about exposure.

41:44.993 --> 41:47.985
They'd just as soon forget
they ever met a transgenic.

41:48.073 --> 41:49.665
We hope.

41:49.753 --> 41:52.347
You're off the hook. At least for today.

41:52.433 --> 41:55.948
Great. I'll just kick it
and be a regular girl then.

41:56.033 --> 41:59.992
A regular girl? What fun is that?

42:01.113 --> 42:03.468
Hey, I'll take what I can get.
