01:10.200 --> 01:13.640
- How was that?
- 2:19, well done, miss!

01:22.439 --> 01:25.959
All samples doing well.
No signs of fragmentation or tissue decay.

01:26.760 --> 01:28.439
Also beat my record by 14 seconds.

01:29.799 --> 01:32.760
- You're a good teacher.
- Not even close to my father.

01:33.319 --> 01:34.879
Well, that makes two of us.

01:38.640 --> 01:39.959
Who's that?

01:42.040 --> 01:43.120
I don't know.

01:59.519 --> 02:00.640
Hiya, can I help?

02:01.400 --> 02:02.879
How are your starfish doing?

02:05.719 --> 02:08.479
- Sorry, do we know each other?
- I'm afraid not.

02:08.560 --> 02:09.639
Alec Kurtz.

02:10.439 --> 02:12.919
Your colleagues at Trinity told me
where I could find you.

02:14.680 --> 02:15.879
It's brilliant!

02:16.879 --> 02:19.560
Did you come all this way
to comment on the view or...?

02:20.520 --> 02:21.520
Certainly not.

02:22.639 --> 02:24.479
- I have something for you.
- What is it?

02:25.439 --> 02:26.759
An offer you can't refuse.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.400
Who's in charge of this?

02:35.479 --> 02:37.319
I'm afraid I'm not allowed to say.

02:39.599 --> 02:41.199
This number, is it monthly or...?

02:41.680 --> 02:43.199
No, that would be weekly, actually.

02:50.479 --> 02:52.479
- They're stars.
- Sorry?

02:53.039 --> 02:54.080
They're not fish.

02:54.719 --> 02:55.919
They're sea stars.

02:56.560 --> 02:57.759
Of course they are.

02:59.280 --> 03:01.000
The plane takes off in five hours.

04:30.959 --> 04:32.040
Zack?

05:01.079 --> 05:02.600
Rachel, what's going on?

05:03.759 --> 05:06.519
Hey, it's all right, it's all right.

05:08.959 --> 05:10.040
Where's Zack?

05:12.360 --> 05:13.399
Rachel, where's Zack?

05:37.000 --> 05:38.120
They belong to Zack.

05:42.360 --> 05:43.920
- Zack's missing.
- Since when?

05:44.240 --> 05:46.720
Someone broke into the lab,
destroyed the equipment,

05:46.800 --> 05:47.800
and there's blood.

05:50.199 --> 05:51.399
Where did you find those?

06:23.360 --> 06:24.800
Wait. Stop!

06:24.879 --> 06:27.160
Stop! Whoa, whoa, stop!

06:27.639 --> 06:30.240
- What the fuck do you think you're doing?
- I'm just cleaning.

06:30.319 --> 06:32.720
- I said stop, Charlie.
- But the Captain always says...

06:32.800 --> 06:34.800
It's ok, Charlie. Look at me. It's ok.

06:35.439 --> 06:36.360
Yeah.

06:38.079 --> 06:39.040
It's blood.

07:02.439 --> 07:03.839
- What's going on?
- Man overboard.

07:03.920 --> 07:05.120
We're turning around.

07:05.199 --> 07:06.920
Hey, Arthur. Icegirl replied.

07:09.439 --> 07:11.839
Just give me a minute, Yuto, ok?
Just a minute.

07:18.560 --> 07:21.360
Hey, what's up? Well?

07:22.160 --> 07:23.160
It's Zack, sir.

07:24.040 --> 07:26.439
- We believe he fell overboard.
- He didn't fall.

07:26.519 --> 07:27.480
He was thrown.

07:28.519 --> 07:30.759
- The DNA sequencer's been shattered.
- What?

07:30.839 --> 07:31.839
Rachel's fine.

07:32.439 --> 07:34.639
And the Captain's turning around
to search for Zack,

07:34.720 --> 07:37.360
- but it's a waste of time.
- He might still be alive.

07:37.439 --> 07:38.839
There's no way he's still alive.

07:39.480 --> 07:42.199
- We don't know that.
- But we know there's a killer on board.

07:42.920 --> 07:45.079
We need to get back to port. Now.

07:45.680 --> 07:46.800
And that's an order.

07:47.399 --> 07:50.560
With all due respect, sir,
I'm not leaving anyone behind.

07:51.879 --> 07:52.800
He's right, Alec.

07:53.920 --> 07:55.199
We can't just sail away.

07:59.639 --> 08:00.639
Very well.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.800
But feeling good about ourselves
is not gonna make us feel any safer.

08:19.560 --> 08:20.879
Thank you, mister Wan.

08:21.319 --> 08:23.399
- Make sure you eat it all.
- Yeah.

08:35.360 --> 08:36.320
So?

08:37.240 --> 08:39.000
Who're you gonna blame this time, huh?

08:40.519 --> 08:41.559
Sir.

08:42.320 --> 08:44.399
- Yeah.
- It's the log from the security system.

08:45.399 --> 08:47.320
Someone entered the lab at 2:12 am.

08:48.840 --> 08:50.000
It's Kowalski.

08:52.840 --> 08:54.279
Oh, shit.

08:54.360 --> 08:56.120
Whoever killed Kowalski took his card.

08:57.559 --> 08:59.360
And that couldn't be Marcus, could it?

09:01.039 --> 09:02.200
His death is on you.

09:11.799 --> 09:13.559
The DNA sequence is toasted.

09:15.080 --> 09:16.799
Good luck trying to repair this.

09:17.919 --> 09:21.080
- Is this where you were sitting?
- No. No.

09:22.519 --> 09:24.600
No, we were waiting for the sequencer.

09:29.120 --> 09:32.639
I had some coffee,
I tried to do some work,

09:34.639 --> 09:36.600
but I couldn't focus, and so...

09:38.480 --> 09:40.799
I went to my desk and I fell asleep.

09:51.879 --> 09:53.559
- Can we get this analyzed?
- Sure.

09:55.240 --> 09:56.559
What are you thinking?

09:56.639 --> 09:58.639
Kowalski's killer
needed to destroy the sequencer

09:58.720 --> 10:00.240
for obvious reasons, all right?

10:00.320 --> 10:03.039
- He tried putting you to sleep.
- Yeah, but Zack didn't drink.

10:03.120 --> 10:04.480
That coffee saved your life.

10:04.559 --> 10:06.600
I told you, she's just getting started.

10:06.679 --> 10:08.440
For fuck's sake,
Maggie is not on this ship.

10:08.519 --> 10:10.320
Someone who's working for her is!

10:11.600 --> 10:13.799
I'm not gonna let this happen again!

10:16.480 --> 10:17.519
That's it!

10:18.799 --> 10:19.919
The work is done.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.519
Wrap it up,
share all your data with Rachel.

10:22.600 --> 10:24.679
- And that includes you.
- And why is that?

10:24.759 --> 10:27.120
- I'm replacing the lot of you.
- What?

10:27.519 --> 10:30.519
Look, there's a killer onboard
and it could be any one of you!

10:31.240 --> 10:32.279
What about you?

10:34.080 --> 10:35.200
What about me?

10:38.000 --> 10:39.519
Go on.

10:39.600 --> 10:41.159
Go on, say it.

10:42.120 --> 10:44.840
You're the only one
who's actually accused of murder here.

10:47.279 --> 10:48.679
Well, if you think I'm guilty,

10:49.679 --> 10:51.720
then you have no place on my fucking team.

10:52.559 --> 10:55.480
Good, because I'm done with your shit.

10:57.840 --> 11:01.279
- What are you still doing here?
- You can't be fucking serious.

11:01.960 --> 11:05.559
This is my research as well.
You can't just discard me.

11:05.639 --> 11:06.600
Try me.

11:09.559 --> 11:10.799
Who you gonna call?

11:21.080 --> 11:22.240
Arthur.

11:23.720 --> 11:26.639
Yuto will grant you access
to all the data.

11:28.799 --> 11:30.480
You're the only one I can trust now.

11:49.519 --> 11:50.759
Fuck.

11:50.840 --> 11:52.039
Fuck!

11:52.120 --> 11:54.519
Fuck, I fucking knew it,
I shouldn't have come!

11:54.840 --> 11:55.919
You're damn right.

12:01.440 --> 12:02.639
None of you should.

12:04.519 --> 12:06.080
Look what you did to Marcus.

12:09.080 --> 12:11.279
You geniuses tried to pin it on us,

12:12.600 --> 12:13.679
and now...

12:14.480 --> 12:15.639
And now he's dead.

12:17.960 --> 12:19.840
I... I had nothing to do with that.

12:20.759 --> 12:21.960
We know it's one of you.

12:24.279 --> 12:25.720
We should lock you up.

12:26.240 --> 12:27.399
All of you.

12:31.360 --> 12:32.480
I'm all for that.

12:33.519 --> 12:34.519
Hey!

12:35.519 --> 12:36.879
Hey, what's going on?

12:39.440 --> 12:40.799
This isn't a fucking drill!

12:41.440 --> 12:43.440
- We have a man overboard.
- You'll see!

12:44.279 --> 12:47.120
Didn't you hear me? To your posts!

12:51.600 --> 12:53.480
Whose side are you on, officer?

12:55.159 --> 12:56.720
There are no sides on this ship.

12:57.559 --> 12:59.200
But we do have a chain of command.

13:01.519 --> 13:02.960
To your posts!

13:04.039 --> 13:05.120
Now.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.159
Come on, Charlie.

13:28.919 --> 13:30.440
What does this mean?

13:30.519 --> 13:32.240
It's her, it's Maggie.

13:32.320 --> 13:34.759
She's toying with us,
that's what it means.

13:35.639 --> 13:37.159
Where is she sending this from?

13:37.799 --> 13:40.159
Impossible to trace.
She could be anywhere.

13:41.200 --> 13:42.240
Not onboard.

13:42.559 --> 13:44.600
Maybe someone
is communicating with her.

13:45.360 --> 13:47.240
Have you checked
if she's got a relationship

13:47.320 --> 13:48.679
with anybody onboard the ship?

13:48.759 --> 13:50.840
Already have.
I ran everything I have on Maggie

13:50.919 --> 13:52.720
through the data of everyone on the ship.

13:52.799 --> 13:56.039
- And?
- Only got one hit on a disabled account.

13:57.600 --> 13:58.600
It's you.

14:00.480 --> 14:02.639
It was posted by a woman
named Sarah Jackson.

14:02.720 --> 14:03.879
Sound familiar?

14:03.960 --> 14:06.279
Yeah, I know who Sarah Jackson is,

14:06.360 --> 14:09.519
but what I don't understand
is her relationship to Maggie.

14:10.919 --> 14:13.519
Maggie is her daughter.

14:15.879 --> 14:18.840
Her real name's Olivia Jackson.

14:37.240 --> 14:38.879
How did I not see this?

14:42.559 --> 14:43.879
You wanna say hello?

14:46.200 --> 14:48.159
- Yeah.
- Alright.

14:53.600 --> 14:55.000
"Dear Maggie,

14:55.799 --> 14:57.720
or should I call you Olivia?

15:00.039 --> 15:02.320
You remind me so much of your mother."

15:05.639 --> 15:09.639
So the water was loaded with Midazolam,
a heavy anesthetic.

15:10.279 --> 15:13.159
They could've taken her liver out
and she wouldn't have flinched.

15:14.159 --> 15:15.720
- Thanks.
- Here you go.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.840
Done. It's on the shared drive.

15:23.320 --> 15:24.440
Ok.

15:28.360 --> 15:32.399
No, you need to export the SAS files
into SQL before compressing.

15:34.039 --> 15:37.080
- You know Python, right?
- Yeah, er, sure.

15:38.039 --> 15:39.240
Yeah.

15:44.759 --> 15:45.879
You'll be alright.

15:47.440 --> 15:48.720
She's just jealous.

15:49.240 --> 15:51.279
Not that I asked
for any special treatment.

15:51.360 --> 15:52.399
What?

15:54.080 --> 15:57.480
I guess it's your father's way
of showing affection.

15:57.960 --> 15:59.720
Well, he's 28 years late.

16:00.440 --> 16:02.320
And tricking me
into working for him? Yeah.

16:02.399 --> 16:04.879
- My therapist is gonna love that.
- Give him a break.

16:05.639 --> 16:06.960
Jail, it uh...

16:08.080 --> 16:09.399
It changes people.

16:10.519 --> 16:11.559
Not him.

16:13.399 --> 16:16.879
He doesn't want to be loved,
he just wants to be admired.

16:18.840 --> 16:21.039
- You are so much like him.
- I'm nothing like him.

16:21.120 --> 16:23.480
Oh, no, you are. You're smart.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.240
You're driven.
You're stubborn like a mule.

16:27.320 --> 16:31.200
And yet he gets this big ship
and I get the little fishing boat.

16:31.279 --> 16:32.679
That was a nice boat, actually.

16:33.960 --> 16:35.080
You should come.

16:35.759 --> 16:37.200
When this is all over.

16:38.320 --> 16:39.679
That sounds like a plan.

16:40.759 --> 16:42.039
I love starfish.

16:43.600 --> 16:44.720
Here you are.

16:46.960 --> 16:48.200
Arthur needs you, Alec.

16:53.080 --> 16:55.240
I'm telling you,
we should fucking do something.

16:56.600 --> 16:58.159
- Hi, mister Wan.
- Good.

16:58.240 --> 17:00.919
Hey, Charlie. You just gonna sit and watch

17:01.000 --> 17:03.159
while that bunch of psychos
fuck us up for good?

17:04.880 --> 17:06.640
I mind my own business.

17:07.200 --> 17:10.079
"I mind my own business
and do what my brother tells me."

17:12.480 --> 17:14.319
And you do what Erika says.

17:15.240 --> 17:17.000
Come on, wake the fuck up, man!

17:17.880 --> 17:19.039
How old are you?

17:19.119 --> 17:21.640
When are you gonna start
making your own fucking decisions?

17:21.960 --> 17:22.960
Hey, leave him alone.

17:24.880 --> 17:26.000
Fuck you too, Wan.

17:37.160 --> 17:38.359
Goodbye, mister Wan.

17:41.440 --> 17:43.720
What...
What part of "no unsupervised comms"

17:43.799 --> 17:44.799
did you not understand?

17:44.880 --> 17:47.319
- I only did what he asked.
- I don't like to be supervised.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.519
- You're a bloody fugitive!
- Precisely.

17:50.200 --> 17:52.279
And this proves that I'm innocent!

17:53.640 --> 17:55.839
How the hell
does she even know about Kowalski?

17:57.480 --> 17:58.480
I don't know.

18:00.319 --> 18:02.200
Right, no more talking to her,
is that clear?

18:02.279 --> 18:03.960
- Yeah.
- Is that clear?

18:05.119 --> 18:06.240
Yes.

18:06.319 --> 18:08.240
But get your people to find her.

18:08.920 --> 18:10.279
I want justice.

18:11.319 --> 18:12.400
We'll do our best.

19:05.880 --> 19:06.880
Hello?

19:10.400 --> 19:11.440
Who's there?

19:19.880 --> 19:21.319
No, hey! Come on, open up!

19:24.640 --> 19:27.119
No, no, no. Come on, open up!

19:28.200 --> 19:29.319
Help! Open up!

19:32.000 --> 19:33.279
Let me out!

19:34.319 --> 19:35.559
Let me out of here!

19:38.119 --> 19:40.359
Someone let me out of here!

19:40.440 --> 19:41.720
Help!

19:58.319 --> 19:59.960
Help! Somebody!

20:00.319 --> 20:02.519
No, no, no. No, no.

20:15.319 --> 20:17.319
Charlie! Charlie!

20:32.279 --> 20:35.279
Man overboard! Port side 45!

20:41.640 --> 20:45.160
- Dead slow astern. Port 15.
- Dead slow astern. Port 15.

20:54.400 --> 20:56.160
Help! Somebody!

20:58.559 --> 21:00.240
Help! Come on!

21:04.359 --> 21:05.720
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

21:06.240 --> 21:07.640
Someone's screaming! Come on.

21:22.359 --> 21:23.680
See it?

21:23.759 --> 21:25.480
-Where?
-It's over there somewhere.

21:28.039 --> 21:29.079
Fuck!

21:29.920 --> 21:31.200
Fuck, fuck, fuck...

21:44.319 --> 21:45.359
Fuck.

22:05.160 --> 22:06.279
It's him.

22:06.720 --> 22:08.039
Rescue boat! Go!

22:10.720 --> 22:11.880
Go, go, go, quickly!

22:27.400 --> 22:28.720
Move it, move it!

22:29.519 --> 22:30.720
Go, go, go, quickly!

22:39.680 --> 22:41.400
- They found him.
- Go inside the boat.

22:41.799 --> 22:42.720
Quickly!

22:49.559 --> 22:50.680
Go inside the boat!

22:51.759 --> 22:53.160
- Go, go, go!
- Come on.

22:53.240 --> 22:54.759
- Ready?
- Yes.

22:58.200 --> 22:59.759
Shit, it's stuck.

23:01.400 --> 23:03.680
- Stay back!
- Oh, for Christ's sake!

23:04.240 --> 23:06.920
- We just want to help, come on!
- Erika, it's stuck.

23:07.359 --> 23:08.680
<i>We're switching on manual.</i>

23:09.160 --> 23:10.960
- Charlie! Manual!
- Yeah, Captain.

23:41.799 --> 23:43.680
Can't they just like drop it or something?

24:02.359 --> 24:04.640
I'm sorry, I... I can't watch this.

25:51.839 --> 25:54.240
<i>Department of Molecular Biology,</i>
<i>Princeton University,</i>

25:54.319 --> 25:55.880
<i>- how may I help you?</i>
- Hello.

25:55.960 --> 25:58.240
I'd like to speak
to Professor Zacharie Dubois.

25:58.960 --> 26:01.720
<i>I'm sorry, but he's not part</i>
<i>of this Department anymore.</i>

26:01.799 --> 26:05.200
Oh, of course, he left
at the beginning of March, right?

26:05.799 --> 26:07.920
<i>Yes. Who am I speaking to?</i>

26:08.920 --> 26:11.480
Oh, I'm just... I'm a colleague.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.319
Did he leave an address
where I could contact him?

26:14.400 --> 26:16.559
He's not been replying
to any of my mails.

26:16.640 --> 26:17.680
<i>No, sorry.</i>

26:19.000 --> 26:22.119
I do need to speak to him quite urgently,
is there someone who might know?

26:22.720 --> 26:25.640
<i>I'm sorry but I can't provide you</i>
<i>with that kind of information.</i>

26:25.720 --> 26:26.759
<i>Have a good day.</i>

26:38.400 --> 26:40.279
Where the fuck are you, Zacharie Dubois?

27:00.279 --> 27:01.319
He's dead.

27:49.160 --> 27:50.319
Hey, Alec!

27:51.319 --> 27:52.480
Something's wrong at the lab.

27:52.559 --> 27:54.480
- The door's not working.
- It must be your card.

27:54.559 --> 27:56.559
- I'll get you a new one.
- No, it's not my card.

27:56.640 --> 27:57.839
There's no power.

27:57.920 --> 27:59.720
<i>Captain,</i>
<i>we got a power failure in the lab.</i>

27:59.799 --> 28:01.240
<i>Can someone go check it?</i>

28:02.400 --> 28:03.680
Where's Rachel?

28:04.839 --> 28:05.960
Fuck.

28:18.960 --> 28:19.960
Alright.

28:20.880 --> 28:22.319
I don't know what happened to it.

28:23.240 --> 28:24.240
Come on.

28:24.880 --> 28:25.920
Fuck.

28:27.480 --> 28:28.559
Rachel?

28:29.039 --> 28:30.319
Alright.

28:35.799 --> 28:36.880
Ok.

28:45.039 --> 28:46.160
Got it.

28:48.839 --> 28:50.000
Rachel?

28:50.079 --> 28:51.200
Rachel!

28:53.519 --> 28:54.680
Rachel, Rachel!

29:02.039 --> 29:03.119
Rachel!

29:07.079 --> 29:08.000
Alec!

29:15.599 --> 29:16.640
Oh, shit.

29:25.680 --> 29:28.200
Call Erika! And get some blankets.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.599
- What happened?
- How long has she been in there?

29:31.680 --> 29:33.920
- Don't know.
- Alec! How long has she been in there?

29:34.000 --> 29:37.200
- Don't know, but she's fucking freezing.
- She's going to be alright…

29:37.960 --> 29:40.359
- Get your coat off, put it round her.
- Alright.

29:51.559 --> 29:55.440
Come on, come on,
alright, alright, alright.

29:57.720 --> 29:59.920
Alright. It's alright, it's alright.

30:13.039 --> 30:14.839
It's alright, it's alright.

30:19.640 --> 30:21.839
It's not fucking working, Alec!

30:21.920 --> 30:24.720
- It's working.
- It's not working!

30:26.279 --> 30:28.000
Come on, Rachel! Come on.

30:30.880 --> 30:32.720
Fuck this, fuck this.

30:33.920 --> 30:36.880
Rachel! Come on. Listen to me, ok?

30:36.960 --> 30:40.559
You listen to me, you listen to me,
you stand for me, ok?

30:40.640 --> 30:42.960
You fucking stand for me. You get up...

30:43.359 --> 30:47.440
<i>You fucking stand, do you hear me?</i>
<i>You stand! Come on!</i>

30:47.519 --> 30:49.279
<i>Stand for me! Go!</i>

30:49.359 --> 30:52.039
<i>Come on, stand, stand for me, please!</i>

30:52.119 --> 30:54.279
Rachel, come on! Please.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.279
Please, baby.

30:56.839 --> 30:59.599
Please, come, come on! Stand!

30:59.680 --> 31:02.559
Stand for me, please,
stand for me, please.

31:02.640 --> 31:03.920
Please!

31:04.440 --> 31:05.519
Come on.

31:06.079 --> 31:08.480
Come on, come on, come on.

31:08.559 --> 31:09.720
Come on, Rachel.

31:09.799 --> 31:11.839
Come on, come on, come on!

31:12.480 --> 31:13.880
Come on! Come on.

31:28.839 --> 31:30.039
Come on...

31:31.440 --> 31:32.359
Come on.

31:44.359 --> 31:45.680
Rachel.

31:46.759 --> 31:47.880
Come on!

31:49.440 --> 31:52.839
Rachel! It's cold, I know.
You need to rest.

31:52.920 --> 31:54.799
Hey. Hey!

31:55.119 --> 31:56.119
Do you know who I am?

32:05.440 --> 32:07.240
It's alright. It's alright.

32:44.079 --> 32:45.200
She's stable.

32:46.680 --> 32:47.960
She's going to be all right.

32:49.400 --> 32:50.440
Thank you.

32:53.200 --> 32:54.359
That was close.

32:56.319 --> 32:58.839
- Doesn't this remind you of something?
- Shut it!

32:58.920 --> 33:00.200
Sorry?

33:00.279 --> 33:01.480
It's nothing.

33:03.480 --> 33:05.680
Remember when I locked you out in the ice?

33:07.000 --> 33:08.599
And you almost froze to death?

33:10.720 --> 33:11.960
That was fun.

33:12.039 --> 33:13.559
She is beautiful, Arthur.

33:14.440 --> 33:16.039
You shouldn't have brought her here.

33:18.680 --> 33:21.319
I want to be the only woman in your life.

33:27.960 --> 33:29.079
I want a gun.

33:30.279 --> 33:32.319
- Excuse me?
- Give me a gun.

33:32.400 --> 33:35.119
- I can't give you a gun.
- There's a killer loose on this ship

33:35.200 --> 33:37.400
and you're doing absolutely nothing!

33:37.480 --> 33:41.039
We lost a day sailing back
for a bloody corpse because you insisted.

33:41.119 --> 33:43.319
And yes, we have a killer on board.

33:43.400 --> 33:46.240
But you did handpick
each and every one of your collaborators.

33:46.319 --> 33:49.640
If you don't protect me, Alec,
I'll do it myself.

33:49.720 --> 33:52.680
I don't need you
to remind me of my duty.

33:52.759 --> 33:54.720
I'm your bloody duty!

33:56.559 --> 33:58.519
Do you realize
how many lives have been lost

33:58.599 --> 34:00.240
trying to make this happen?

34:01.079 --> 34:05.319
But there's one life, just one,
that you can't afford to lose.

34:05.400 --> 34:06.720
And that's mine.

34:12.079 --> 34:14.760
So give me a gun.

34:20.239 --> 34:21.559
Fucking hell.

34:36.840 --> 34:39.199
I've been thinking
about those Icegirl messages.

34:39.280 --> 34:40.400
What about them?

34:40.840 --> 34:44.719
Well, she mentioned Kowalski.
Why... Why him?

34:45.360 --> 34:46.559
What does she know?

34:50.400 --> 34:52.079
Face recognition.

34:52.960 --> 34:54.119
Brilliant.

34:56.920 --> 34:58.719
Now, why was he killed first?

34:59.199 --> 35:00.960
Well, he was my right-hand man.

35:01.880 --> 35:03.320
Maybe there's something else.

35:04.719 --> 35:06.360
Something we're missing.

35:14.320 --> 35:15.519
Wait, what's this?

35:21.840 --> 35:24.320
Looks like scribblings
from one of his notebooks.

35:24.400 --> 35:26.480
Yeah, but where is it? The notebook.

35:27.360 --> 35:29.239
Well, maybe the killer took it with him.

35:29.320 --> 35:32.880
I'm no Columbo
but, when the killer got Zack,

35:32.960 --> 35:34.880
he could have easily gone for Rachel
right there.

35:35.599 --> 35:36.840
Why leave her for later?

35:37.480 --> 35:40.440
It might all be part
of the Polaris reenactment.

35:41.800 --> 35:43.360
Or maybe she didn't have to die.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.239
Not until you asked her
to wrap up the research

35:46.320 --> 35:48.360
and granted her access to all the files.

35:49.199 --> 35:51.400
- Bloody hell.
- That must be it.

35:52.199 --> 35:54.519
The head, the freezer...

35:55.719 --> 35:57.000
They're all distractions.

35:58.360 --> 35:59.920
The killer's after your work.

36:04.239 --> 36:05.760
<i>We have a fucking snitch.</i>

36:11.280 --> 36:13.960
- Hey.
- Hey, what are you up to?

36:14.039 --> 36:16.800
Arthur told me
to finish up Rachel's work, so...

36:17.679 --> 36:20.239
I see. So now he trusts you.

36:21.480 --> 36:23.639
Well, I guess he's running out of options.

36:24.480 --> 36:26.519
And we go way back.

36:27.440 --> 36:28.440
Ok.

36:30.320 --> 36:33.559
Aren't you afraid
of being here all by yourself?

36:34.920 --> 36:36.239
Are you?

36:36.320 --> 36:37.920
Hell yeah! But I'm armed.

36:40.480 --> 36:42.199
I want to take a look at this.

36:42.639 --> 36:46.760
- What for?
- It must have an internal memory.

36:47.480 --> 36:51.360
Maybe Yuto could recover the data.
The DNA tests.

36:55.199 --> 36:56.360
It looks ok.

36:57.639 --> 36:58.800
It should all be here.

37:14.440 --> 37:15.519
Hey!

37:16.320 --> 37:17.840
Why are we going so slow?

37:18.360 --> 37:20.559
It's a minor problem. We're on it.

37:21.639 --> 37:23.800
It's the CO2 fire extinguishing system.

37:27.400 --> 37:30.079
<i>The red bottles in the engine room</i>
<i>are full of CO2.</i>

37:30.159 --> 37:31.519
<i>If there's a fire in the engine,</i>

37:31.599 --> 37:33.559
<i>the engine room is sealed</i>
<i>and flooded with CO2,</i>

37:33.639 --> 37:35.559
<i>displacing the oxygen</i>
<i>and killing the fire.</i>

37:37.719 --> 37:39.960
<i>There's a failure on one of the valves.</i>
<i>We're on it.</i>

37:44.320 --> 37:46.320
We can't go full ahead until it's fixed.

37:50.039 --> 37:51.039
Yes, Oscar.

37:51.400 --> 37:53.440
Yes, Captain,
everything is back to normal.

37:53.519 --> 37:56.519
- Everything is under control.
- Good job. Thank you.

37:58.760 --> 37:59.760
Full ahead, then.

38:00.320 --> 38:01.400
Full ahead, Captain.

38:01.840 --> 38:02.920
Solved.

38:06.679 --> 38:08.320
Onwards, my princess.

38:18.800 --> 38:19.880
Hey!

38:22.440 --> 38:24.280
- Is something wrong?
- No.

38:26.119 --> 38:28.519
Charlie. Is it the dead man?

38:29.239 --> 38:30.719
No, I didn't like him.

38:31.440 --> 38:33.400
I think he's better off dead.

38:34.119 --> 38:36.320
Don't ever say that again.

38:36.800 --> 38:38.719
Not to me, not to anyone.

38:38.800 --> 38:41.320
- But why are you hitting me?
- It hurts me more.

38:43.760 --> 38:45.320
- Wil is right...
- Wil?

38:45.400 --> 38:47.400
- What does Wil have to do with it?
- Yeah!

38:47.480 --> 38:49.400
He says I don't need you!
I'm not a kid anymore!

38:49.480 --> 38:51.119
- Yeah! He says you don't need me?
- Yeah!

38:51.199 --> 38:54.280
That's just fucking great, Charlie!
You know what I say?

38:54.360 --> 38:56.880
Fuck Wil. Stay away from him.

38:56.960 --> 38:59.559
- I told you to mind your own business.
- I'm a grown-up.

38:59.960 --> 39:02.039
- Oh, yes, you're very grown-up.
- Yes.

39:02.119 --> 39:04.480
Now it's whatever Wil says.
Well, you know what I say?

39:04.559 --> 39:06.000
- What?
- Let him look after you!

39:10.280 --> 39:11.440
Shit.

39:12.119 --> 39:13.119
Charlie.

39:16.360 --> 39:18.599
So both Lou Kowalski and Zacharie Dubois

39:18.679 --> 39:21.360
left their jobs
just days before Arthur escaped

39:21.440 --> 39:23.320
and neither of them
said where they were going.

39:23.719 --> 39:25.280
<i>Yeah, but where?</i>

39:25.719 --> 39:26.719
I don't know.

39:27.239 --> 39:29.360
He's got to have
other collaborators and...

39:30.440 --> 39:32.440
Surely he's got
some women working for him.

39:33.360 --> 39:36.119
We've just got to keep looking.
Someone will make a mistake.

39:37.119 --> 39:38.480
<i>He can't hide forever.</i>

39:40.519 --> 39:41.559
Neither can you.

39:49.920 --> 39:51.039
<i>What?</i>

39:53.440 --> 39:54.800
He knows who I am.

39:55.639 --> 39:59.800
<i>What? No, how...</i>
<i>How would he even know that?</i>

40:01.280 --> 40:02.960
He replied to the Icegirl thread.

40:05.039 --> 40:07.320
He said I remind him of my mother.

40:09.239 --> 40:10.360
Are you serious?

40:11.920 --> 40:14.320
<i>For fuck's sake, Liv,</i>
<i>what are we gonna do now?</i>

40:16.199 --> 40:18.840
<i>Ma... Maybe we just lay low for a bit</i>

40:18.920 --> 40:21.960
<i>and wait</i>
<i>until he leaves us alone and then...</i>

40:22.039 --> 40:23.639
<i>He'll know who you are too, just...</i>

40:24.079 --> 40:26.159
<i>Just come here</i>
<i>and make sure you're not followed.</i>

40:27.800 --> 40:29.800
<i>We outsmarted him once.</i>
<i>We can do it again.</i>

40:31.639 --> 40:33.960
I won't stop searching until I find him.

40:36.920 --> 40:38.079
I'll make him pay.

41:21.639 --> 41:22.559
Go away.

41:28.239 --> 41:29.840
Forgive me, Charlie.

41:29.920 --> 41:31.199
No, go away.

41:33.159 --> 41:35.480
Charlie, I didn't mean to hit you,
I'm really sorry.

41:38.199 --> 41:39.880
- Charlie, forgive me, please.
- No.

41:40.960 --> 41:42.119
Come on, Charlie forgi--

41:42.920 --> 41:44.159
Go away.

41:47.199 --> 41:48.199
As you wish.

41:50.480 --> 41:54.159
SPAIN WORLD CHAMPIONS!

41:58.760 --> 42:00.599
It's the 115th minute.

42:05.960 --> 42:08.280
- Puyol passes to Navas.
- Stop it.

42:08.360 --> 42:11.719
Navas goes on a 30-meter slaloming run
and crosses into their half.

42:11.800 --> 42:14.559
- I told you to stop!
- He passes the ball to Andrés Iniesta.

42:14.639 --> 42:18.000
Andrés Iniesta, the genius,
back heels it to Cesc Fábregas,

42:18.079 --> 42:21.480
Fábregas plays it back to Navas,
Navas sees El Niño Torres open...

42:21.559 --> 42:23.280
On the wing, he passes him the ball,

42:23.360 --> 42:25.679
- El Niño Torres crosses into the box...
- No...

42:25.760 --> 42:27.639
He's rejected by the Dutch defense,

42:27.719 --> 42:29.840
but the ball goes to Cesc Fábregas...

42:29.920 --> 42:32.440
Fábregas sees Iniesta alone,

42:32.519 --> 42:34.239
who shoots and...

42:39.559 --> 42:44.480
- Goal!
- Goal!

42:44.559 --> 42:45.960
- Goal!
- Goal!

42:49.199 --> 42:50.239
Yes!

42:52.159 --> 42:53.239
Good job!

42:54.119 --> 42:55.119
Hey!

42:55.559 --> 42:58.800
- Yuto, tell me it's working.
- Yeah, it's all here.

42:58.880 --> 43:00.199
But there's tons of files.

43:01.079 --> 43:02.719
But can you find the last ones?

43:03.559 --> 43:06.000
The last one is from last night, 2:12 am.

43:06.079 --> 43:07.079
Yeah.

43:17.000 --> 43:18.079
Charlie.

43:20.840 --> 43:22.079
We got him.

43:26.079 --> 43:27.079
Good job.

43:34.760 --> 43:37.039
What would you consider
to be one of your strengths?

43:41.360 --> 43:44.440
I'm very good fixing engines.

43:47.800 --> 43:49.159
And with animals.

43:51.400 --> 43:52.599
I love animals.

43:53.519 --> 43:54.599
Do you have a pet?

43:55.039 --> 43:58.119
- Yeah, I have a dog.
- Oh, yeah, I love dogs.

43:59.880 --> 44:01.119
I've never had one.

44:03.159 --> 44:04.360
I will.

44:05.519 --> 44:06.960
I will call him...

44:10.519 --> 44:11.679
Tyson.

44:14.599 --> 44:15.639
Tyson.
