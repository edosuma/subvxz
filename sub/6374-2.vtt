MAYBE IF WE CAN FIND OUT

(Amanda scoffs)

00:12.000 --> 00:13.600
He could be anybody.

00:14.300 --> 00:15.400
THEY DENIED MY VISA.

00:15.400 --> 00:17.800
I HAVE TO STAY HERE
FOR I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.500
I MAY NOT HAVE "MODE,"
BUT VERY SOON,

00:19.500 --> 00:23.100
I WILL HAVE EVERYTHING ELSE,
INCLUDING YOUR HUSBAND.

00:23.800 --> 00:25.600
ALEXIS, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

00:25.600 --> 00:27.800
WHY DO YOU KEEP CALLING ME
ALEXIS?

00:27.800 --> 00:29.900
IT'S ME, ALEX.

00:29.900 --> 00:32.700
THIS WHOLE THING WITH HENRY,
IT FINALLY GOT TO ME.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.000
(Daniel) HENRY'S GONE.

00:34.300 --> 00:35.900
I'M LOOKING FOR SOMETHING
FOR MY KID.

00:40.100 --> 00:41.800
(sobs)
OH, GOD, HE'S GONE.

00:47.300 --> 00:52.800
"AND IN THESE DIFFICULT TIMES
WHICH CHALLENGE US ????

00:53.100 --> 00:55.800
I'm remind??? FAMILIES"...

00:55.800 --> 00:58.200
AND I ???

01:06.700 --> 01:09.300
DON'T WORRY.
NO ONE NOTICED.

01:13.300 --> 01:16.600
AND I WAS SAYING,
"LIKE ALL GREAT FAMILIES,

01:16.600 --> 01:19.100
WE WILL PULL THROUGH THIS
TOGETHER."

01:19.700 --> 01:21.900
 <i>BRAVA! BRAVA!</i>

01:21.900 --> 01:23.300
 <i>BRAVA!</i>
(applause)

01:25.300 --> 01:27.300
SO THAT IS
MY LETTER FROM THE EDITOR

01:27.300 --> 01:30.700
COMMENTING ON THE RECENT
MEADE FAMILY MISFORTUNES.

01:32.700 --> 01:33.300
BETTY?

01:33.300 --> 01:36.500
UM, I'M SORRY, BUT SHOULDN'T
THE LETTER FROM THE EDITOR

01:36.500 --> 01:38.900
BE WRITTEN BY THE EDITOR--
DANIEL?

01:41.500 --> 01:42.600
OH, BETTY,

01:42.600 --> 01:46.200
DEAR, PIE-EYED,
PIE-EATING BETTY.

01:46.200 --> 01:48.300
HIS SISTER
HAS LOST HER MEMORY.

01:48.300 --> 01:49.400
HE'S STILL IN A WHEELCHAIR.

01:49.400 --> 01:52.600
NOW I KNOW HE PAYS YOU FOR YOUR
SOUTH-OF-THE-BORDER SPIRIT,

01:52.900 --> 01:54.200
BUT LET'S GIVE DANIEL
A BREAK.

01:54.200 --> 01:55.800
BUT HE'S FINE.
HE COULD TOTALLY DO--

01:55.800 --> 01:58.100
OKAY, PEOPLE,????

01:58.100 --> 01:59.100
LET'S GET TO WORK.

02:01.800 --> 02:04.300
 <i>(woman) DR. FINE, PROCTOLOGY.</i>
 <i>DR. FINE...</i>

02:04.300 --> 02:06.100
PARTIAL RETROGRADE AMNESIA

02:06.500 --> 02:08.199
THE LAST THING
ALEXIS REMEMBERS

02:08.199 --> 02:10.300
IS MOM'S BIRTHDAY PARTY
TWO YEARS AGO.

02:10.300 --> 02:12.100
NOTHING SINCE THEN. BLANK.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.400
SHE DOESN'T EVEN REMEMBER
BECOMING A WOMAN.

02:14.400 --> 02:15.200
LOOK AT HER.

02:16.200 --> 02:17.800
SHE'S BEEN DOING THAT
ALL NIGHT.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.700
AS FAR AS ALEXIS KNOWS,
WE'RE A HAPPY FAMILY.

02:22.700 --> 02:24.600
SHE DOESN'T KNOW
MOM AND DAD ARE DIVORCED.

02:24.600 --> 02:26.600
SHE DOESN'T KNOW MOM
ESCAPED FROM PRISON,

02:26.600 --> 02:28.400
OR WAS IN PRISON,
FOR THAT MATTER.

02:30.200 --> 02:31.100
BETTY?

02:31.200 --> 02:34.000
SORRY. I WAS JUST TRYING
TO PUT MYSELF IN HER SHOES.

02:34.300 --> 02:35.400
OKAY,
ARE YOU READY TO GO?

02:35.400 --> 02:37.500
NO, NO, NO, NO. I CAN'T.
I GOTTA STAY WITH HER.

02:37.600 --> 02:39.600
I'M THE REASON SHE'S HERE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

02:39.600 --> 02:43.900
WHAT? NO. DANIEL, WILHELMINA HAS
BEEN RUNNING "MODE" BY HERSELF.

02:43.900 --> 02:45.700
SHE HASN'T TAKEN
ANY OF YOUR CHANGES,

02:45.700 --> 02:46.900
AND SHE WROTE
THE LETTER FROM THE EDITOR.

02:46.900 --> 02:48.100
THE ISSUE SHIPS TOMORROW.

02:48.100 --> 02:49.600
DON'T YOU AT LEAST
WANT TO SIGN OFF ON THE BOOK?

02:49.600 --> 02:52.000
SEE, THAT'S ANOTHER THING.
HOW I AM SUPPOSED TO TELL ALEXIS

02:52.000 --> 02:54.200
OUR FATHER
IS MARRYING WILHELMINA?

02:54.300 --> 02:57.400
SO THAT'S A YES
ON SEEING THE BOOK?
YEAH, GET THE BOOK.

02:59.800 --> 03:00.800
(Alexis) DANIEL?

03:03.000 --> 03:04.700
IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU WANT TO TELL ME?

03:06.600 --> 03:08.100
<i>CLAIRE MEADE IS STILL AT LARGE</i>

03:08.100 --> 03:10.600
 <i>AFTER ESCAPING FROM RIKERS</i>
 <i>THREE WEEKS AGO.</i>

03:10.600 --> 03:13.400
 <i>CLAIRE, IF YOU'RE WATCHING,</i>
 <i>LOSE THE ANKLE BRACELET.</i>

03:13.400 --> 03:15.000
 <i>CHUNKY IS OUT.</i>

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:25.400 --> 03:27.600
A LOCK OF YOUR HAIR
IN THIS ONE

03:27.600 --> 03:30.900
AND A PIECE OF BRADFORD'S
EAR HAIR IN THIS ONE.

03:30.900 --> 03:32.400
HOW DO YOU EVEN KNOW
HOW TO DO THAT?

03:32.400 --> 03:35.300
D.N.A. TESTING?
OH, NOT THE FIRST TIME.

03:35.300 --> 03:39.900
SO IN 24 HOURS,
WE WILL HAVE CONCLUSIVE PROOF

03:39.900 --> 03:41.900
IF BRADFORD MEADE
IS YO' DADDY.

03:41.900 --> 03:42.500
OH. (giggles)

03:45.100 --> 03:47.300
YOU OKAY?
I DON'T KNOW.

03:47.600 --> 03:49.900
I JUST STARE
AT HER PICTURE ALL DAY,

03:49.900 --> 03:51.800
AND THEN I STARE AT MYSELF
IN THE MIRROR.

03:51.800 --> 03:53.600
MORE THAN USUAL?
YEAH.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.800
OH.
I JUST WISH
I GOT TO KNOW HER BETTER.

03:55.800 --> 03:56.900
YEAH, YEAH, AND I WISH

03:56.900 --> 03:58.800
I GOT TO KNOW MARLON BRANDO
BEFORE HE GOT FAT,

03:58.800 --> 04:00.500
BUT CAN WE CUT
TO WHAT'S IMPORTANT HERE?

04:01.000 --> 04:04.800
THERE'S A FEY SOMMERS ESTATE
OUT THERE WITH YOUR NAME ON IT.

04:05.200 --> 04:07.100
HAVE YOU HEARD
FROM THE LAWYERS YET?

04:07.200 --> 04:09.500
I SHOULD BE GETTING THE NEWS
LATER TODAY.

04:09.500 --> 04:12.300
JUST WAITING TO HEAR
FROM THE PROBATE JUDGE.

04:20.600 --> 04:23.300
MOM, ALL THE BOXES
ARE STILL HERE.

04:23.300 --> 04:25.100
YEAH, I KNOW.
I'M STILL GOING THROUGH THEM.

04:25.100 --> 04:28.500
YOUR FATHER HAD
A LOT OF GREAT STUFF AT HIS APARTMENT,
LIKE THESE.

04:28.900 --> 04:30.200
YOU CAN'T FIND THESE
ANYWHERE.

04:30.200 --> 04:33.400
MOM, WE'RE IN QUEENS.
YOU CAN FIND THOSE <i>EVERYWHERE.</i>

04:33.400 --> 04:35.400
THEY WERE YOUR FATHER'S.
WE'RE KEEPING THEM.

04:38.600 --> 04:41.100
HERE'S YOUR LUNCH
FOR YOUR FIRST DAY AT "MODE,"

04:41.100 --> 04:42.900
MR. BIG SHOT INTERN!

04:42.900 --> 04:45.000
YOU WANT ME
TO <i>BRING</i> MY LUNCH?

04:45.300 --> 04:47.900
MOM,
THE FAMOUS "MODE" CAFETERIA?

04:47.900 --> 04:50.500
WHERE NAOMI CAMPBELL HAD
A TUNA MELT AND A MELTDOWN?

04:50.900 --> 04:52.300
THEY NOW HAVE IT
ON THE MENU--

04:52.400 --> 04:54.400
THE NAOMI CAMPBELL
TUNA MELTDOWN.

04:54.900 --> 04:56.200
(whispers) OH.
YEAH.

04:57.700 --> 05:00.200
(normal voice) DO YOU KNOW
I AM SO PROUD OF YOU?

05:00.800 --> 05:02.800
AND I KNOW YOUR FATHER
WOULD BE, TOO.

05:04.100 --> 05:06.900
OH! MWAH. THAT FACE!

05:07.000 --> 05:08.400
AND CALL RANDY DEZERGA.

05:08.400 --> 05:11.000
SEE IF HE'S FREE
TO SHOOT THE MILAN SHOWS.

05:11.000 --> 05:11.900
WILL DO, WIL.

05:11.900 --> 05:14.500
OH, AND I GOT
A CALL FROM ALEXA D--AAH!

05:15.600 --> 05:17.000
WHAT IS THAT?

05:17.000 --> 05:20.500
DID I FORGET TO INTRODUCE YOU
TO DWAYNE, MY NEW BODYGUARD?

05:20.600 --> 05:22.300
I CAN'T KEEP CHECKING
OVER MY SHOULDER

05:22.300 --> 05:23.600
TO SEE
IF THAT CRAZY CLAIRE MEADE'S

05:23.600 --> 05:25.700
RUNNING AFTER ME
WITH A BOTTLE OF ACID.

05:27.400 --> 05:29.500
SO HE'LL JUST ATTACK ANYONE?

05:29.500 --> 05:31.200
IF HE FEELS I'M IN DANGER.

05:32.200 --> 05:35.300
OH, MY GOD! IT'S CLAIRE MEADE
CHARGING FOR US.

05:37.700 --> 05:38.600
(Betty) HELP!

05:39.500 --> 05:40.800
RELEASE, DWAYNE.

05:43.900 --> 05:46.300
WHOA! EXCUSE ME!
WHAT DO YOU WANT, BETTY?

05:46.800 --> 05:49.500
I WAS JUST... COMING
TO GET THE BOOK

05:49.500 --> 05:51.000
SO DANIEL
COULD SIGN OFF ON IT.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.100
TELL DANIEL THE ISSUE
WILL BE FILLED

05:53.100 --> 05:55.800
WITH PRETTY GIRLS
WEARING SKIMPY LITTLE DRESSES.

05:55.800 --> 05:57.000
THAT'S ALL HE CARES ABOUT
ANYWAY.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.700
BUT I THINK THAT HE REAL--
BYE, BETTY.

05:58.700 --> 05:59.800
BUT HE REAL--
GOOD-BYE, BETTY.

05:59.800 --> 06:00.600
I KNOW THAT--
DWAYNE.

06:00.600 --> 06:03.300
OKAY, OKAY.
I'M LEAVING.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.200
UH, CONFIRM MY LUNCH
WITH NORA EPHRON

06:07.200 --> 06:09.900
AND MAKE SURE DWAYNE
GETS A SET OF MY HOUSE KEYS.

06:18.600 --> 06:19.700
MARC...
OH.

06:19.700 --> 06:21.100
YOU KNOW DANIEL
NEEDS TO SEE THE BOOK

06:21.100 --> 06:22.100
BEFORE IT GOES
TO THE PRINTER.

06:22.100 --> 06:23.400
COME ON.
PLEASE. THIS IS MY JOB.

06:23.400 --> 06:24.800
COULDN'T I JUST BORROW IT
FOR, LIKE, AN HOUR?

06:24.800 --> 06:27.300
GET AWAY FROM MY DESK, OR I'LL ???

06:29.000 --> 06:30.500
WHAT ARE THESE?

06:31.000 --> 06:32.200
THIS SAYS
"TO DANIEL MEADE."

06:32.200 --> 06:33.900
THEY'RE JUST SOME NOTES
FROM THE EDITORS.

06:33.900 --> 06:35.800
DON'T YOU WORRY
YOUR BUSHY LITTLE HEAD ABOUT IT.

06:35.800 --> 06:37.400
WILHELMINA'S
ALREADY APPROVED THEM.

06:37.400 --> 06:38.500
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

06:38.500 --> 06:41.000
HE HASN'T EVEN SEEN THEM!
OOPS.

06:41.800 --> 06:43.400
NOW I REALLY NEED
TO SEE THAT BOOK.

06:43.400 --> 06:45.100
LOOK, IT'S ????

06:45.100 --> 06:46.600
SO I COULDN'T
GIVE IT TO YOU

06:46.600 --> 06:48.200
EVEN IF I WANTED TO,
WHICH I DON'T.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.900
OH, DWAYNE.
IT'S A KEY. DON'T EAT IT.

06:51.200 --> 06:53.300
MARC, I NEED TO FIRE CHLOE
IN PRODUCTION.

06:53.300 --> 06:56.100
I WANT YOU TO STAND NEXT TO ME
AND NOD THOUGHTFULLY.
MM.

06:57.100 --> 06:58.100

07:21.900 --> 07:23.000

07:45.800 --> 07:46.700
HI.

07:46.800 --> 07:50.000
HENRY.
YOU'RE NOT IN TUCSON.

07:51.100 --> 07:53.000
I AM. I-I MEAN, I WAS.

07:53.400 --> 07:54.100
OH.

07:54.800 --> 07:56.500
A-AND I'M GOING BACK.

07:57.500 --> 07:58.300
OH.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.300
I-I-I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT SANTOS.

08:02.700 --> 08:05.800
YEAH, THANKS. I GOT THE FLOWERS.
THAT WAS VERY SWEET.

08:06.100 --> 08:09.600
SO, UH, EVERYTHING
WITH THE BABY AND...

08:09.900 --> 08:12.000
YEAH. YEAH, IT'S ALL GOING
ACCORDING TO PLAN.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.600
I'VE GOT MY BABY BOOKS,

08:13.600 --> 08:15.400
I'M TAKING THE INFANT
C.P.R. CLASS.

08:16.100 --> 08:18.100
BUT, YOU KNOW, WHATEVER.

08:19.100 --> 08:21.200
HENRY,
IT'S OKAY TO BE EXCITED.

08:21.900 --> 08:23.000
I REALLY AM.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.500
THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT BECOMING A FATHER.

08:25.600 --> 08:27.100
YOU KNOW, I COULD WORK
MY WHOLE LIFE

08:27.100 --> 08:28.400
AND NEVER BE
THE BEST ACCOUNTANT,

08:28.400 --> 08:31.200
BUT MAYBE I-I CAN BE
THE BEST DAD.

08:32.600 --> 08:33.799
I THINK YOU WILL BE.

08:35.900 --> 08:37.700
LISTEN,
THE REASON I'M HERE...

08:38.100 --> 08:39.100
UH-HUH.

08:39.100 --> 08:41.200
I COULDN'T REALLY FIND
A GREAT JOB IN TUCSON,

08:41.799 --> 08:43.500
AND THE MEADE HEALTH INSURANCE
WOULD COVER

08:43.500 --> 08:45.400
ALL THE MEDICAL EXPENSES
FOR THE BABY, SO--

08:45.400 --> 08:48.300
OH. SO YOU'RE COMING
BACK TO WORK.

08:48.300 --> 08:49.600
ONLY IF IT'S OKAY
WITH YOU, BETTY.

08:49.600 --> 08:51.500
IF YOU THINK IT'S A PROBLEM,
I'LL TURN DOWN THE JOB,

08:51.500 --> 08:53.200
BECAUSE I KNOW,
IT--IT MIGHT BE WEIRD.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.000
NO!
NO?

08:55.300 --> 08:56.800
I MEAN "NO"

08:56.800 --> 08:57.900
IT'S ????

08:57.900 --> 09:00.600
NOT "NO," DON'T TAKE THE JOB.
WHY WOULD IT BE WEIRD?

09:00.600 --> 09:02.500
BECAUSE WE GOT
A LITTLE ROMANTIC?

09:02.800 --> 09:04.800
WE WERE YOUNG
AND INNOCENT THEN.

09:04.800 --> 09:07.400
AH, YOUTH. BUT EVERYTHING'S
COOL BETWEEN US.

09:07.400 --> 09:10.100
WE COULD JUST BE FRIENDS.
BUDDIES.

09:10.200 --> 09:11.000
BUDDIES?

09:11.000 --> 09:13.600
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
LIKE, "HEY, BUDDY."

09:13.600 --> 09:15.100
UH, "WHAT'S UP, BUDDY?"

09:15.100 --> 09:16.600
UH, "WHAT'S THE DILLYO?"

09:17.000 --> 09:18.100
"DILLYO"?

09:19.500 --> 09:22.200
I CAN'T BE BUDDIES WITH HIM.
AND HE WAS ALL LIKE,

09:22.200 --> 09:23.600
"OH, ARE YOU OKAY
WITH ME WORKING HERE?"

09:23.600 --> 09:25.000
WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO SAY, NO?

09:25.000 --> 09:26.900
"NO, YOU CAN'T MAKE MONEY
FOR YOUR BABY."

09:26.900 --> 09:28.100
DOWN WITH BABIES!
(baby cries)

09:31.400 --> 09:34.500
BETTY, YOU NEED TO TELL HIM
MAYBE THE BABY ISN'T EVEN HIS.

09:34.500 --> 09:36.400
AND MAYBE IT IS.
I MEAN, WHO KNOWS?

09:36.400 --> 09:38.300
IF CHARLIE
WAS HAVING SEX WITH FARKAS,

09:38.300 --> 09:40.200
SHE WAS PROBABLY HAVING SEX
WITH A MILLION GUYS.

09:40.200 --> 09:42.300
'CAUSE YOU KNOW SHE'S A SLUT.
THE BABY COULD BE ANYBODY'S.

09:42.300 --> 09:44.000
IT COULD BE THAT GUY'S. HEY,
DID YOU SLEEP WITH CHARLIE?

09:44.000 --> 09:45.500
YOU MIGHT BE HAVING A BABY.

09:45.600 --> 09:47.700
BETTY, HENRY NEEDS
TO KNOW THE TRUTH.

09:47.700 --> 09:50.300
WELL, NOT FROM ME. I'M NOT
BREAKING APART A FAMILY.

09:50.300 --> 09:51.900
I'VE GOT ENOUGH DRAMA
IN MY LIFE.

09:51.900 --> 09:54.400
MY DAD IS STUCK IN MEXICO.
HE CAN'T COME HOME.

09:54.400 --> 09:56.200
THAT'S MORE THAN
I CAN DEAL WITH RIGHT NOW.

09:56.300 --> 09:57.500
OKAY, WE'RE HERE.

09:58.200 --> 09:59.300
WHAT? WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"WE'RE HERE"?

09:59.300 --> 10:00.400
OH, DIDN'T I TELL YOU?

10:00.400 --> 10:02.100
WE'RE BREAKING
INTO WILHELMINA'S APARTMENT.

10:02.800 --> 10:03.500
WHAT?

10:09.600 --> 10:12.200
NOW YOU NEED SUNSCREEN.
HEY.

10:12.600 --> 10:14.400
BETTY'S SON.
NEPHEW.

10:14.400 --> 10:15.100
MEH.

10:15.100 --> 10:19.500
SO I'M SORRY
ABOUT YOUR... MOTHER?
FATHER.

10:19.500 --> 10:22.700
YES, YES. WE SIGN
SO MANY CARDS HERE.

10:23.100 --> 10:24.100
SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING
AT "MODE"?

10:24.100 --> 10:27.000
YOU AND YOUR LITTLE BAND
OF RUFFIANS PICKING POCKETS?

10:27.000 --> 10:29.200
MY AUNT BETTY GOT ME
A SUMMER INTERNSHIP.

10:29.200 --> 10:32.600
OH. GET THAT FOR ME

10:35.900 --> 10:38.400
THIS COULD BE FUN.
DO YOU NEED ANYTHING DONE?

10:38.500 --> 10:42.300
BETTY HAS ME SHARPENING PENCILS.
I MEAN, I LOVE HER, BUT YAWN.

10:42.400 --> 10:45.500
YEAH, HOW DO YOU LIVE
WITH THAT? LET'S SEE.

10:45.900 --> 10:49.500
WILHELMINA NEEDS
HER CONTACTS UPDATED.

10:50.500 --> 10:52.000
ANY INTEREST?

10:52.400 --> 10:53.700
THIS IS WILHELMINA'S?

10:53.700 --> 10:55.000
MM-HMM.

10:59.700 --> 11:01.900
GOOD AFTERNOON.
I'M LOOKING FOR AMANDA TANEN.

11:01.900 --> 11:03.700
I'M FROM RICHMAN,
BRETT AND JACOBS.

11:03.700 --> 11:05.800
THE LAWYERS?
WHAT DO I GET? AM I RICH?

11:06.100 --> 11:08.300
I TAKE IT
YOU'RE AMANDA TANEN.

11:08.400 --> 11:10.200
OH, MY GOD.DO I get this watch?

11:10.200 --> 11:12.400
THAT IS MINE.
PLEASE SIGN THIS.

11:12.400 --> 11:13.600
WHAT ABOUT
THE CIGARETTE CASE?

11:13.600 --> 11:15.800
PLEASE STOP TOUCHING MY THINGS.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.100
SO IT APPEARS
MISS SOMMERS' TOWN HOUSE,

11:18.100 --> 11:19.400
WARDROBE AND AUTOMOBILES

11:19.400 --> 11:21.200
WERE AUCTIONED OFF
AT THE TIME OF HER DEATH,

11:21.200 --> 11:23.400
AND THE PROCEEDS
WERE GIVEN TO CHARITY.

11:24.700 --> 11:26.100
YOU MEAN IT'S ALL GONE?

11:26.100 --> 11:27.800
NOT EVERYTHING.

11:29.600 --> 11:31.100
THIS IS FOR YOU.

11:34.700 --> 11:37.000
AAH! WHAT IS THAT?

11:37.000 --> 11:40.100
IT'S YOUR MOTHER'S
BELOVED DOG HALSTON.

11:40.800 --> 11:41.900
NICE TRY, SLICK,

11:41.900 --> 11:44.300
BUT YOU'RE NOT STICKING ME
WITH THIS GREMLIN.

11:44.300 --> 11:45.400
DID I HAPPEN TO MENTION

11:45.400 --> 11:47.000
THERE'S A $1,000-A-WEEK
ALLOWANCE

11:47.000 --> 11:49.100
FOR WHOEVER AGREES
TO CARE FOR HIM?

11:51.200 --> 11:52.300
OH!

11:53.500 --> 11:55.000
OH, YES.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.300
(baby talk voice)
WHO'S THE LITTLE BABY?

12:02.400 --> 12:06.200
SO YOU TOLD ALEXIS
ABOUT YOUR MOTHER AND FEY?

12:06.200 --> 12:07.900
LOOK, SHE FOUND OUT
ABOUT MOM ON TV,

12:07.900 --> 12:10.600
BUT I AM NOT GONNA
BE THE ONE TO TELL ALEXIS

12:10.600 --> 12:13.100
YOU DIVORCED MOM
TO MARRY WILHELMINA,

12:13.700 --> 12:15.400
OR THAT YOU REJECTED
YOUR OWN CHILD

12:15.400 --> 12:17.100
BECAUSE SHE BECAME A WOMAN.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.200
I HAVE NO PROBLEM
TELLING ALEXIS THE TRUTH.

12:22.500 --> 12:24.800
THEN GREAT. HER ROOM'S
RIGHT DOWN THERE.

12:26.600 --> 12:30.000
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE ACTUALLY
IN LUCIFER'S CHAMBER...

12:31.000 --> 12:32.500
BEELZEBUB'S LAIR...

12:32.900 --> 12:34.900
THE DEVIL'S RUMPUS ROOM.

12:34.900 --> 12:38.000
OOH, LOOK. A PHOTOGRAPH
OF WILHELMINA WITH DICK CHENEY.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.800
CHRISTINA, PLEASE STOP
ENJOYING YOURSELF AND HELP.

12:39.800 --> 12:41.500
WE'VE GOT TO GET THE BOOK
AND GET OUT OF HERE.

12:41.500 --> 12:42.700
(whispers) THE BEDROOM.

12:44.600 --> 12:47.700
(normal voice) SATAN'S BOUDOIR.
VAMPIRA'S--
STOP IT.

12:47.800 --> 12:49.400
10 BUCKS SAYS
THERE'S A COAT IN THERE

12:49.400 --> 12:51.400
MADE OUT
OF DALMATIAN PUPPIES.

12:52.600 --> 12:54.700
(gasps) HERE IT IS.
I GOT IT. HERE IT IS.

12:57.600 --> 12:58.700
WHO IS THAT?
(Wilhelmina speaking
indistinctly)

12:59.500 --> 13:01.700
WILHELMINA'S SUPPOSED
TO BE AT LUNCH WITH NORA EPHRON.

13:02.800 --> 13:04.200
(man laughs)
THAT'S NOT NORA EPHRON.

13:04.500 --> 13:06.300
THAT'S A MAN.
IT'S MR. MEADE.

13:06.300 --> 13:09.000
THEY'RE HERE FOR A QUICKIE,
AN AFTERNOON DELIGHT.

13:09.100 --> 13:10.800
AFTERNOON DE--
THAT'S WHAT THAT MEANS?

13:10.800 --> 13:13.000
I NEVER UNDERSTOOD THAT SONG
TILL JUST NOW.
(door closes)

13:14.200 --> 13:16.800
OKAY, UM, UNDER THE BED.

13:20.600 --> 13:21.700
(gasps)
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

13:32.600 --> 13:35.100
(Wilhelmina) I'M SO HAPPY
TO GET OUT OF THAT OFFICE.

13:37.200 --> 13:38.700
THIS IS JUST SO DECADENT.

13:38.700 --> 13:42.300
EVERYONE AT THE OFFICE THINKS I'M HAVING LUNCH
WITH THE GREAT NORA EPHRON.

13:42.300 --> 13:43.300
LITTLE DO THEY KNOW,

13:43.300 --> 13:47.400
NORA'S BEEN COVERING
MY DAYTIME ROMPS FOR YEARS.

13:47.700 --> 13:51.100
YOU SEEM A LITTLE TENSE.
HOW ABOUT A BACK RUB?

13:52.000 --> 13:53.600
(whispers)
THAT'S NOT MR. MEADE.

13:57.300 --> 13:59.400
CAN I BE ON TOP THIS TIME?

14:00.200 --> 14:01.700
DON'T BE STUPID.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
(TWO HOURS?)

14:12.800 --> 14:14.500
(I HAVE TO PEE)

14:20.800 --> 14:23.100
WELL, THAT WAS RELAXING.

14:23.400 --> 14:25.800
I DO LOVE
AN AFTERNOON DELIGHT.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.800
IS THAT
WHAT THAT SONG MEANS?

14:29.600 --> 14:30.500
COME, DWAYNE.

14:30.500 --> 14:32.700
I THINK I NEED SOME PROTECTING
IN THE SHOWER.

14:52.500 --> 14:54.200
 <i>(man) AND THE PITCH.</i>
 <i>BALL THREE...</i>

14:54.200 --> 14:56.600
OH, COME ON.
THAT WAS A STRIKE, YOU IDIOT!

14:57.400 --> 14:58.800
NOT INTERRUPTING, AM I?

14:59.600 --> 15:01.700
(scoffs)
JUST ANOTHER BLOWN SAVE.

15:02.600 --> 15:04.500
YEAH, WE COULD STILL USE
A GOOD CLOSER.

15:05.200 --> 15:07.100
I SEE THERE'S SOME OF ALEX
STILL IN THERE.

15:07.100 --> 15:08.600
WHAT WAS THAT?

15:12.000 --> 15:13.400
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

15:13.900 --> 15:15.100
WHAT'S UP, DAD?

15:15.900 --> 15:17.700
YOU HAVEN'T CALLED ME THAT
IN YEARS.

15:17.700 --> 15:21.400
WELL, I-I WAS A LITTLE
HEADSTRONG WHEN I WAS ALEX.

15:21.800 --> 15:24.400
MAYBE ALEXIS CAN HAVE
A SOFTER TOUCH.

15:27.300 --> 15:28.700
MAYBE I CAN, TOO.

15:33.100 --> 15:36.500
OKAY, WILHELMINA'S CONTACTS
ARE COMPLETELY REORGANIZED.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.800
ALSO, I INVENTORIED
ALL THE GOWNS THAT SHE WORE

15:38.800 --> 15:41.400
ON THE RED CARPET LAST YEAR
AND BOOKED HER TRAVEL TO PARIS

15:41.400 --> 15:42.800
FOR THIS SEASON'S
COUTURE SHOWS.

15:42.800 --> 15:44.400
AND WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?

15:44.700 --> 15:46.000
I DID IT IN UNDER AN HOUR.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.100
AN HOUR?

15:47.400 --> 15:48.600
YOU WANT
TO KNOW WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING?

15:48.600 --> 15:51.100
PRICING WEIMARANERS,
GETTING A PLUMBER FOR THE HOUSE IN BEDFORD,

15:51.100 --> 15:52.600
SENDING WARREN BEATTY A 60th--

15:52.600 --> 15:55.100
YEAH, RIGHT--BIRTHDAY CARD,
TELLING DAVID SEDARIS

15:55.100 --> 15:57.000
HIS 5,000-WORD PIECE
IS NOW A 50-WORD PIECE,

15:57.000 --> 15:58.200
GETTING YELLED AT
BY DAVID SEDARIS

15:58.200 --> 16:00.000
AND ASKING CHRIS ROCK
TO WRITE A 10-MINUTE TOAST

16:00.000 --> 16:01.400
THAT WILHELMINA
IS GIVING TO PATTY HEARST

16:01.400 --> 16:03.200
TO MARK THE 33rd ANNIVERSARY
OF HER KIDNAPPING--

16:03.200 --> 16:06.800
AND <i>THAT</i> IS ALL
IN THE LAST FIVE MINUTES.

16:07.700 --> 16:08.300
WOW.

16:08.300 --> 16:10.400
YEAH, THAT'S HOW
THIS LADY ROLLS.
(telephone rings)

16:10.400 --> 16:12.900
HANG ON.
WILHELMINA SLATER'S OFFICE.

16:13.900 --> 16:14.900
OH, MY GOD.

16:15.300 --> 16:16.500
IT'S COMING UP NOW?

16:18.500 --> 16:20.000
THE CONTRACT RIDER
FOR SHAKIRA'S PHOTO SHOOT

16:20.000 --> 16:21.400
IS ARRIVING AS WE SPEAK.

16:21.400 --> 16:24.500
IN IT IS A LIST
OF EVERYTHING SHE NEEDS

16:24.500 --> 16:25.900
FOR HER DRESSING ROOM.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.500
AMBITIOUS SUCK-UPS!

16:28.600 --> 16:30.800
I MEAN... INTERNS!

16:30.800 --> 16:32.400
WRITE THIS DOWN.
EVERYTHING.

16:32.500 --> 16:33.900
I'M DOING OKAY, <i>PAPI.</i>

16:34.400 --> 16:37.500
I JUST--I MISS HIM SO MUCH.

16:37.500 --> 16:38.600
I know, <i>Mija,</i>

16:38.600 --> 16:40.100
BUT IT'LL GET BETTER.

16:40.100 --> 16:42.800
????

16:42.800 --> 16:45.300
YEAH. AT LEAST
I HAVE HIS THINGS.

16:45.300 --> 16:46.200
WHAT THINGS?

16:46.300 --> 16:48.200
I WENT AND I CLEANED OUT
HIS APARTMENT.

16:48.700 --> 16:50.600
A LOT OF HIS STUFF LOOKS
REALLY GOOD IN OUR PLACE.

16:50.600 --> 16:53.800
REALLY? I DON'T REMEMBER SANTOS
HAVING SUCH GOOD TASTE.

16:53.800 --> 16:54.600
You're crazy.

16:54.600 --> 16:57.600
HE HAD SUCH AN EYE.
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT.

16:57.600 --> 16:59.100
Sweetheart, um,

16:59.400 --> 17:01.500
I know everything
holds a memory for you now,

17:01.500 --> 17:04.800
BUT ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE NOT
GETTING A LITTLE CARRIED AWAY?

17:05.800 --> 17:06.700
When your mother died,

17:06.700 --> 17:08.300
I couldn't let go
of any of her things--

17:08.300 --> 17:10.300
HER CLOTHES, HER KEY CHAIN.

17:11.400 --> 17:13.200
I EVEN FOUND
AN OLD RESTAURANT CHECK

17:13.200 --> 17:15.000
FROM PIETRO'S IN BAYSIDE.

17:16.500 --> 17:18.400
IT WAS FROM THE NIGHT
WE GOT ENGAGED.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.099
YOUR MOTHER HAD SAVED IT
ALL THOSE YEARS,

17:22.200 --> 17:23.500
AND WHEN I SAW IT, I...

17:24.000 --> 17:26.400
I REALIZED I DIDN'T NEED
ALL HER THINGS.

17:27.800 --> 17:29.100
I HAD HER HEART.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.400
SO I KEPT THE CHECK...

17:33.300 --> 17:34.800
AND GOT RID
OF EVERYTHING ELSE.

17:35.100 --> 17:36.900
BUT WHERE IS IT?
I'VE NEVER SEEN IT.

17:36.900 --> 17:39.200
I'M LOOKING AT IT RIGHT NOW.

17:41.800 --> 17:43.700
I REALLY MISS YOU, <i>PAPI.</i>

17:44.500 --> 17:45.700
I MISS U TOO.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
(telephone beeps)
HEY, ????

17:51.000 --> 17:53.400
SORRY I'M LATE, MAMA.
I'LL GET THE ENCHILADAS STARTED.

17:53.400 --> 17:54.800
MIRTA'S NOT HERE.

17:55.600 --> 17:57.800
THANK GOD. ENOUGH WITH
THE BEANS AND CHEESE.

17:57.800 --> 17:58.900
YOU WANNA ORDER CHINESE?

17:58.900 --> 18:00.000
BEANS, CHINESE?

18:00.000 --> 18:01.600
(speaks Spanish)

18:01.700 --> 18:02.800
ARE YOU OKAY?

18:03.600 --> 18:05.500
I WAS JUST TALKING TO HILDA.

18:05.800 --> 18:08.100
YOU GET LIKE THIS
EVERY TIME YOU CALL.

18:08.100 --> 18:10.700
YOUR VISA WILL COME THROUGH.
YOU'LL BE HOME SOON.

18:10.700 --> 18:12.800
I'M SO TIRED OF HEARING THAT!

18:14.100 --> 18:15.900
I DON'T WANT
TO WAIT ANY LONGER, CLARA!

18:16.600 --> 18:19.600
MY DAUGHTER BURIED
THE LOVE OF HER LIFE,

18:19.600 --> 18:21.500
AND I COULDN'T BE THERE
TO HOLD HER.

18:23.200 --> 18:26.400
MAYBE I SHOULD
JUST GET THERE ON MY OWN.

18:27.600 --> 18:29.800
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?
FORGET THE VISA.

18:29.900 --> 18:32.200
I'LL JUST GET ACROSS THE BORDER
ANOTHER WAY.

18:32.200 --> 18:35.100
I'VE DONE IT BEFORE.
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

18:35.700 --> 18:37.400
I HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE.

18:37.400 --> 18:39.400
TREAT ME LIKE A CRIMINAL,
I'LL BE ONE.

18:42.200 --> 18:43.700
I WANNA GO HOME.

18:47.100 --> 18:48.100
WELL, THEN...

18:49.400 --> 18:51.500
IF YOU THINK
THIS IS THE ONLY WAY,

18:52.300 --> 18:54.300
I MIGHT KNOW SOMEONE
WHO CAN HELP YOU.

18:57.400 --> 18:59.400
DWAYNE, PLEASE HURRY.

19:10.100 --> 19:12.600
I SMELL A BURRITO.

19:14.500 --> 19:15.900
THIS IS EMBARRASSING.

19:16.400 --> 19:19.300
A.J., YOU WERE ASSIGNED
NUMBER SIX ON SHAKIRA'S RIDER.

19:19.300 --> 19:20.600
READ THAT TO ME.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.700
"ONE BOX OF BENDY STRAWS"?

19:22.700 --> 19:24.900
UH-HUH. BENDY STRAWS!

19:24.900 --> 19:27.900
NOW LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT WHAT YOU BROUGHT BACK.

19:28.300 --> 19:32.400
OKAY, SO I'M SHAKIRA, AND I
WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A DRINK,

19:32.400 --> 19:34.900
SO I TAKE A STRAW,
AND I PUT IT IN MY CUP.

19:34.900 --> 19:37.900
A--OH, BUT WHAT'S THIS?

19:38.200 --> 19:40.800
IT DOESN'T BEND?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

19:40.800 --> 19:44.100
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO DRINK?
LIKE--LIKE THIS?

19:47.000 --> 19:48.800
THIS ISN'T COMFORTABLE.
I CAN'T DRINK LIKE THIS.

19:48.800 --> 19:51.900
AM I SOME KIND OF ANIMAL? NO.
 <i>YO SOY</i> SHAKIRA!

19:51.900 --> 19:54.000
AND I WILL NOT BE HOLDING
MY DRINK DOWN AROUND MY CHIN

19:54.000 --> 19:56.600
LIKE SOME SAVAGE
IF I'M THIRSTY!

19:57.700 --> 20:01.800
NOW THIS STRAW DEBACLE
IS JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG.

20:01.800 --> 20:04.300
ONLY ONE OF OF YOU--
 <i>ONE--</i>

20:05.300 --> 20:07.200
GOT HIS LIST CORRECT.

20:07.800 --> 20:08.600
JUSTIN.

20:09.300 --> 20:11.500
THE REST OF YOU CAN LEAVE.

20:12.300 --> 20:16.400
JUSTIN, YOU ARE
IN CHARGE OF EVERYTHING.

20:16.500 --> 20:17.400
AWESOME.

20:22.900 --> 20:23.500
GO.

20:23.600 --> 20:24.900
I HAVE A TASK FOR YOU.

20:24.900 --> 20:25.500
HMM?

20:25.500 --> 20:28.400
I NEED DIRT
ON BETTY SUAREZ.

20:29.500 --> 20:31.800
I'M HEARING YOU LOUD AND CLEAR,
WILHE-MEISTER.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.900
OKAY, CHOCOLATE ALMOND MILK.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.700
I THINK THAT THERE'S
A HEALTH STORE ON 59th.

20:36.700 --> 20:38.600
OH, PFFT! THERE'S PLENTY
OF TIME FOR THAT.

20:38.600 --> 20:39.700
I WAS JUST THINKING,

20:40.200 --> 20:43.100
WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT OUR FAMILIES.

20:43.200 --> 20:44.300
YOU GO FIRST.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.800
I'M LOOKING FOR
A PACKAGE FOR ALEXIS.

20:48.800 --> 20:50.500
IRONIC, AS I SAY THAT
OUT LOUD.

20:52.500 --> 20:54.900
(sniffs) OH!
WHAT IS THAT SMELL?

20:55.200 --> 20:56.600
I THINK
IT'S THAT DOG.

20:56.600 --> 20:58.100
IT IS NOT THAT DOG.

20:58.100 --> 20:59.500
IT SMELLS LIKE ASS.

20:59.500 --> 21:03.100
YEAH, AND WHEN YOU'RE 84, YOU'RE
GONNA SMELL LIKE ASS, TOO.

21:03.100 --> 21:04.500
LEAVE HALSTON ALONE.

21:04.500 --> 21:06.000
HE WAS A GIFT TO ME
FROM MY MOTHER.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
I GET $1,000 A WEEK
TO TAKE CARE OF HIM,

21:08.000 --> 21:09.600
WHICH MEANS $5 FOR DOG FOOD,

21:09.600 --> 21:11.400
AND THE NEW BALENCIAGA BAG
FOR ME.
(wheezes)

21:14.600 --> 21:16.300
(gasps)
IS HE SUPPOSED TO
TIP OVER LIKE THAT?

21:16.300 --> 21:17.700
OH, MY GOD!

21:18.200 --> 21:21.300
AMANDA! OH, THERE YOU ARE!
IS DANIEL IN HIS OFFICE?

21:21.300 --> 21:24.300
I DON'T KNOW WHERE DANIEL IS.
I HAVE TO GO TO THE VET!

21:24.600 --> 21:27.300
HANG ON, HALSTON.
DON'T QUIT ON ME.

21:28.700 --> 21:29.800
WELL, IF HE WASN'T
AT THE HOSPITAL,

21:29.800 --> 21:31.600
THEN WHERE COULD HE BE?

21:31.600 --> 21:33.000
JUSTIN, ARE YOU DOING OKAY?

21:33.000 --> 21:34.800
CAN'T TALK.
LOOKING FOR GUA JUICE.

21:36.200 --> 21:37.000
WHY DO YOU CARE SO MUCH

21:37.000 --> 21:38.600
IF WILHELMINA'S
BOINKING THE BODYGUARD?

21:38.600 --> 21:40.500
BECAUSE DANIEL IS LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING

21:40.500 --> 21:42.900
TO INCRIMINATE WILHELMINA,
AND HE COULD USE THIS--

21:43.200 --> 21:43.900
(gasps)
OH!

21:46.000 --> 21:47.900
GOOD, YOU'RE BACK.
WILHELMINA WANTS TO SEE YOU.

21:48.300 --> 21:50.300
OH, UM, OKAY, YEAH, GREAT.

21:50.300 --> 21:52.100
I JUST HAVE SOME THINGS
THAT I NEED TO FINISH UP,

21:52.100 --> 21:53.800
AND I'LL STOP BY HER OFFICE
ON THE WAY OUT.

21:53.800 --> 21:54.900
NO, YOU WON'T.

21:54.900 --> 21:59.700
SHE'S WAITING FOR YOU
RIGHT NOW... ON THE ROOF.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.200
THE ROOF?

22:01.200 --> 22:03.000
THE ROOF.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.800
HELLO?

22:19.400 --> 22:21.100
WILHELMINA?

22:28.600 --> 22:31.000
I BELIEVE YOU LOST SOMETHING.

22:39.800 --> 22:42.100
THANK YOU, MARC.
YOU CAN GO NOW.

23:11.800 --> 23:13.499
YOU SURPRISE ME, BETTY.

23:13.500 --> 23:15.099
STEALING MY KEYS?

23:15.100 --> 23:18.100
BREAKING INTO MY APARTMENT?
TAKING THE BOOK?

23:19.000 --> 23:21.299
GOOD FOR YOU.
YOU'RE... GROWING.

23:21.300 --> 23:23.099
LOOK, I WAS JUST THERE
FOR THE BOOK.

23:23.100 --> 23:26.200
I DIDN'T MEAN TO HEAR
ANYBODY HAVING SEX.

23:26.500 --> 23:28.800
LOOK, DWAYNE AND I
ARE DEAR OLD FRIENDS.

23:28.800 --> 23:31.100
THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH BRADFORD.

23:31.100 --> 23:33.000
WHOM YOU LOVE, RIGHT?

23:33.000 --> 23:34.699
BECAUSE YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED
IN A MONTH.

23:34.700 --> 23:37.800
WHOM I LOVE MADLY.

23:37.900 --> 23:39.500
DO WE UNDERSTAND
EACH OTHER?

23:39.700 --> 23:40.799
WILHELMINA,
I'M SURE YOU UNDERSTAND

23:40.800 --> 23:42.499
THAT MY LOYALTIES
ARE WITH DANIEL,

23:42.500 --> 23:46.000
SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR INVITING ME.

23:46.000 --> 23:49.300
IT WAS VERY WONDERFUL TO SEE
THE ROOF. THANK YOU.

23:50.200 --> 23:52.500
PITY ABOUT YOUR FATHER.

23:54.100 --> 23:56.000
WHAT ABOUT MY FATHER?

23:56.000 --> 23:59.900
OH, I KNOW
THAT HE'S STUCK IN <i>MEXICO.</i>

23:59.900 --> 24:03.400
SHAME. MY FATHER
IS A UNITED STATES SENATOR.

24:03.800 --> 24:06.700
HE HELPS PEOPLE GET
THEIR VISAS ALL THE TIME.

24:06.700 --> 24:08.300
SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

24:08.800 --> 24:11.500
(scoffs) COME ON, GIRL.
I AM BLACK. YOU'RE MEXICAN.

24:11.500 --> 24:14.200
LET'S NOT TALK AROUND IT LIKE
A COUPLE OF DULL WHITE PEOPLE.

24:14.200 --> 24:18.400
KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT
AND YOUR OLD MAN COMES HOME.

24:18.400 --> 24:20.400
SO LIE TO DANIEL?

24:20.400 --> 24:23.100
NOT LIE,
JUST DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

24:24.200 --> 24:25.800
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE.

24:30.100 --> 24:31.200
YOU THINK ABOUT IT, BETTY,

24:31.200 --> 24:33.600
AND GET BACK TO ME
BY THE END OF THE DAY.

24:33.600 --> 24:35.199
NO PRESSURE.

24:35.200 --> 24:39.100
AFTER ALL, YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S HOLDING ALL THE CARDS.

24:49.100 --> 24:50.100
HEY, BETTY.

24:50.100 --> 24:51.300
WHAT'S UP, BUDDY?

24:51.300 --> 24:52.800
AH!

24:53.400 --> 24:54.500
OW.

24:55.900 --> 24:57.200
HEY.

24:58.100 --> 25:01.199
STILL NOT VERY GOOD
AT THAT.
HEY, I TALKED TO DAD!

25:01.200 --> 25:03.700
OH, UH, YOU OKAY?

25:03.700 --> 25:05.499
OKAY? I'M GREAT!

25:05.500 --> 25:07.399
IT'S JUST WONDERFUL TO KNOW

25:07.400 --> 25:09.499
I HAVE SUCH A SUPPORTIVE FAMILY
AT A TIME LIKE THIS.

25:09.500 --> 25:10.400
SUPPORTIVE?

25:10.400 --> 25:13.700
HE'S TOTALLY SUPPORTIVE
ABOUT ME BECOMING THIS...

25:13.800 --> 25:15.500
WITH THESE.

25:16.800 --> 25:19.000
WILL YOU STOP
GRABBING THEM FOR A SECOND?

25:19.600 --> 25:23.200
DAD... SAID HE WAS OKAY
WITH ALL THIS?

25:24.800 --> 25:26.900
WHAT ELSE
DID HE TELL YOU?

25:26.900 --> 25:28.200
(Justin) AND I GOT
THE SEEDLESS GRAPES,

25:28.200 --> 25:29.500
A TUB OF RED VINES.

25:29.500 --> 25:32.100
THE ONLY THING I COULDN'T FIND
WAS THE SCULLY FOODS

25:32.100 --> 25:35.700
100% ORGANIC, ALL-NATURAL
SOY RICE CAKES.

25:35.700 --> 25:36.800
AH, THE RICE CAKE--

25:36.800 --> 25:38.700
THE SCOURGE OF MANY
A CELEBRITY ASSISTANT.

25:38.700 --> 25:42.500
NEED I MENTION THE '88 MADONNA
"SPEED THE PLOW" TANTRUM?

25:42.500 --> 25:43.300
DON'T SWEAT IT.

25:43.300 --> 25:44.800
YOU STILL HAVE 12 MORE HOURS

25:44.800 --> 25:49.300
BEFORE YOU NEED TO BRING THEM
TO THE SHAKIRA SHOOT.

25:49.700 --> 25:51.600
OH... MY... GOD.

25:51.600 --> 25:54.000
I AM GOING TO
THE SHAKIRA PHOTO SHOOT?
YEP.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.600
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
THESE LIPS DON'T LIE.

25:56.600 --> 25:57.600
THIS IS AMAZING!

25:57.600 --> 25:59.800
I CANNOT WAIT TO TELL MY...

26:03.000 --> 26:04.400
YOU OKAY?

26:04.600 --> 26:06.399
YEAH, I'LL SEE YOU
TOMORROW.

26:06.400 --> 26:08.000
HEY, JUSTIN.

26:09.600 --> 26:11.000
IT'S OKAY.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.099
I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH
A LOT WITH YOUR DAD

26:13.100 --> 26:14.800
AND EVERYTHING, BUT...

26:16.300 --> 26:18.000
IT'S OKAY TO BE HAPPY.

26:19.600 --> 26:21.800
U DID
A GOOD JOB TODAY.

26:22.800 --> 26:23.700
ENJOY IT.

26:31.300 --> 26:32.100
HI.
HI.

26:32.100 --> 26:34.600
I JUST MADE A LITTLE PERSON
FEEL BETTER ABOUT HIS DAY.

26:34.600 --> 26:37.700
I'M A GOOD PERSON.
NO, I'M A GREAT PERSON.

26:37.700 --> 26:40.600
DOES YOUR RAT
HAVE A STRONG SMELL?

26:40.600 --> 26:43.199
HALSTON IS SICK, OKAY?
I JUST TALKED TO THE VET.

26:43.200 --> 26:45.200
HE NEEDS OINTMENTS
AND PATCHES AND PILLS.

26:45.200 --> 26:47.599
OH, MY.
SUDDENLY I AM A CAREGIVER.

26:47.600 --> 26:49.699
ME.
THAT IS SO NOT WHO I AM.

26:49.700 --> 26:53.200
'TIS TRUE. YOU ARE A BIT OF
A MONSTER ON THE INSIDE.

26:53.200 --> 26:54.600
THIS IS HORRIBLE.

26:54.600 --> 26:57.000
IT'S ALMOST LIKE I'D BE
BETTER OFF GETTING RID OF HIM.

27:04.700 --> 27:06.000
HOW COULD YOU?

27:06.800 --> 27:07.400
DAMN IT.

27:07.400 --> 27:09.700
HOW COULD YOU LIE
TO ALEXIS LIKE THAT?

27:10.500 --> 27:13.200
DID I? I DON'T REMEMBER
WHAT I SAID.

27:13.200 --> 27:15.000
WELL, LET'S START WITH HOW
YOU DIDN'T TELL HER

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
YOU'D REJECT HER
IF SHE GOT A SEX CHANGE.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.399
I THINK YOUR EXACT WORDS WERE,
"YOU'D BE DEAD TO ME."

27:19.400 --> 27:21.300
AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN TELL HER
ABOUT WILHELMINA.

27:21.300 --> 27:23.800
YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED
IN A MONTH, DAD.

27:26.700 --> 27:30.800
YOU'RE RIGHT, DANIEL.
I DIDN'T.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.700
I SAW ALEXIS
LYING IN THAT BED

27:33.700 --> 27:37.600
AND REALIZED I ALMOST LOST
MY CHILD... AGAIN.

27:37.800 --> 27:40.699
THIS IS A CHANCE FOR US TO START
A WHOLE NEW RELATIONSHIP.

27:40.700 --> 27:42.999
NO WAY. YOU ARE NOT SCREWING
WITH HER HEAD LIKE THIS.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.700
IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA TELL HER
THE TRUTH, I AM.

27:46.300 --> 27:49.300
DANIEL... YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE

27:49.300 --> 27:51.899
TO HAVE A CHANCE
TO REWRITE THE PAST.

27:51.900 --> 27:54.700
I NEED TO FIX
THE MISTAKES I MADE.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.600
 <i>(Ignacio) MIJA?</i>

28:15.100 --> 28:16.800
DAD?

28:17.500 --> 28:18.699
 <i>YOU ALL RIGHT?</i>

28:18.700 --> 28:20.900
DAD, HELME!
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

28:20.900 --> 28:23.200
 <i>YEAH,</i>
 <i>IT'S AOUGH DECISION.</i>

28:23.200 --> 28:25.300
 <i>LET ME TELL YOU</i>
 <i>WHAT TO DO.</i>

28:25.300 --> 28:28.300
 <i>KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT AND GET</i>
 <i>MY ASS HOME FROM MEXICO.</i>

28:28.300 --> 28:30.400
BUT DANIEL'S MY BOSS.

28:30.400 --> 28:32.300
 <i>OH, YEAH? WELL, DID YOUR BOSS</i>
 <i>BRING YOU HOME</i>

28:32.300 --> 28:34.299
 <i>IN A LITTLE BLANKIE</i>
 <i>FROM THE HOSPITAL?</i>

28:34.300 --> 28:36.000
 <i>DID YOUR BOSS TEACH YOU</i>
 <i>HOW TO SWIM?</i>

28:36.000 --> 28:37.200
 <i>DID YOUR BOSS</i>
 <i>PULL YOU OFF THE TRACKS</i>

28:37.200 --> 28:39.600
 <i>SECONDS BEFORE A SUBWAY CAR</i>
 <i>WAS ABOUT TO CRUSH YOU?</i>

28:39.600 --> 28:41.900
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU DID THAT.
 <i>I DIDN'T,</i>

28:41.900 --> 28:44.400
 <i>THE FIRST TWO THINGS</i>
 <i>WEREN'T IMPRESSIVE ENOUGH.</i>

28:44.400 --> 28:47.599
 <i>FAMILY, BETTY. WHAT'S MORE</i>
 <i>IMPORTANT THAN FAMILY?</i>

28:47.600 --> 28:50.999
I KNOW, <i>PAPI,</i> I KNOW.
IT'S JUST...

28:51.000 --> 28:52.300
IT'S SO WRONG,

28:52.300 --> 28:55.100
AND WE SHOULD JUST
TRUST THE SYSTEM, RIGHT?

28:55.100 --> 28:57.100
I MEAN, YOU'LL GET
YOUR VISA ON YOUR OWN.

28:57.100 --> 29:00.100
AND ISN'T IT MORE IMPORTANT
FOR ME TO TELL THE TRUTH

29:00.100 --> 29:03.000
 <i>I HATE IT</i>
 <i>THAT I RAISED YOU RIGHT.</i>

29:04.300 --> 29:06.300
OOH, THOSE SMELL GOOD.

29:06.400 --> 29:08.500
CAN I HAVE SOME?

29:09.100 --> 29:10.300
 <i>YOU'RE HELPING DANIEL.</i>

29:10.300 --> 29:14.300
 <i>GET</i> DANIEL <i>TO MAKE YOU</i>
 <i>ENCHILADAS!</i>

29:22.600 --> 29:25.200
HEY, CHRISTINA,
I WAS WONDERING...

29:25.200 --> 29:27.600
DID YOU KNOW IF,
FOR SOME REASON,

29:27.600 --> 29:29.800
BETTY MIGHT BE
MAD AT ME?

29:30.400 --> 29:31.800
I DON'T KNOW.
I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

29:31.800 --> 29:34.100
I MEAN, YOU DID LEAD HER ON,
THEN RACE OFF TO TUCSON,

29:34.100 --> 29:34.800
THEN AFTER A FEW WEEKS,

29:34.800 --> 29:36.400
ONCE SHE WAS STARTING
TO FEEL A LITTLE BIT BETTER,

29:36.400 --> 29:38.700
SUDDENLY POP BACK INTO
HER LIFE AGAIN.

29:39.600 --> 29:43.099
I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND YOU.
OH, HENRY.

29:43.100 --> 29:45.700
SHE'S NOT MAD, SHE'S JUST
A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED.

29:45.700 --> 29:47.399
WELL, I'M CONFUSED, TOO.

29:47.400 --> 29:50.800
I MEAN, I KNOW I HAVE
THIS OBLIGATION TO CHARLIE

29:50.800 --> 29:53.800
AND I CAN'T WAIT
TO BE A DAD, BUT...

29:54.700 --> 29:57.700
I JUST... I REALLY MISS
WHAT BETTY AND I HAD.

29:57.900 --> 30:00.900
HENRY, SHE'S MAKING
AN UMPTY OUT OF YOU.
AN UMPTY?

30:00.900 --> 30:02.100
JACKASS.
BETTY?

30:02.100 --> 30:03.700
CHARLIE!
HOW?

30:05.400 --> 30:07.100
(sighs) MM, HENRY...

30:07.400 --> 30:08.400
COME HERE.

30:08.900 --> 30:12.300
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING
ABOUT THIS BABY OF YOURS,

30:12.700 --> 30:14.700
'CAUSE SOMEBODY'S GOT TO.

30:15.500 --> 30:18.800
OKAY, HALSTON,
THIS IS YOUR NEW HOME!

30:18.800 --> 30:21.700
ISN'T IT PRETTY?
IT'S SO PRETTY.

30:21.700 --> 30:22.999
SO PRETTY.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.600
CAN I HELP YOU?

30:24.800 --> 30:27.800
HI, I'M LOOKING FOR A NICE NEW
HOME FOR MY SWEET LITTLE DOGGY.

30:27.800 --> 30:30.100
YEAH, WE'LL TAKE IT.
SIGN THIS FORM.

30:30.100 --> 30:32.100
SO IS THERE, LIKE,
A BIG GRASSY AREA IN THE BACK

30:32.100 --> 30:35.400
WHERE THE DOGGIES
CAN RUN AROUND?
SURE, WITH PEANUT BUTTER

30:35.400 --> 30:36.900
AND A POOL SHAPED LIKE
A DOG BONE.

30:36.900 --> 30:38.800
AH!
REALLY?

30:39.100 --> 30:40.400
NO.

30:44.400 --> 30:47.100
HEY, UH, CAN I
AT LEAST SAY GOOD-BYE?

30:51.500 --> 30:57.000
OKAY, HALSTON, I'M SURE
SOMEONE WILL ADOPT YOU.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.200
(snorts) I DON'T KNOW.
THAT IS ONE UGLY DOG.

30:59.500 --> 31:01.000
POT, KETTLE, BLACK.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.600
(Amanda) DO YOU MIND?

31:02.600 --> 31:05.000
THIS DOG BELONGED TO MY MOTHER.

31:05.000 --> 31:05.700
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

31:05.700 --> 31:07.300
DOES YOUR MOTHER KNOW
YOU'RE DOING THIS?

31:07.300 --> 31:09.400
BECAUSE I'M NOT GOING DOWN
THAT ROAD AGAIN.

31:09.400 --> 31:15.100
MY MOTHER IS GONE,
AND THIS WAS HER DOG.

31:15.500 --> 31:20.100
AND SHE ONCE HELD HIM
JUST LIKE I AM HOLDING HIM NOW.

31:22.900 --> 31:24.099
MM.

31:24.100 --> 31:27.500
YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT HER
THAN I WILL EVER KNOW.

31:27.500 --> 31:30.599
AND SO WHAT IF YOU'RE MANGY
AND DISGUSTING

31:30.600 --> 31:33.400
WITH A WEIRD RASH
ON YOUR BUTT?

31:33.400 --> 31:35.299
ORAYBE THAT IS YOUR BUTT?

31:35.300 --> 31:39.200
BUT YOU'RE THE ONLY CONNECTION
I'LL EVER HAVE TO MY MOTHER.

31:41.500 --> 31:44.600
BACK OFF, CUJO.
I'M TAKING HIM HOME.

31:51.400 --> 31:54.000
HUNGRY?
MM!

31:54.000 --> 31:55.800
I BROUGHT YOU
BARROW STREET BURGERS.

31:55.800 --> 31:58.500
YOU MAY NOT REMEMBER,
BUT YOU ALWAYS LIKED IT.

31:58.500 --> 31:59.900
HEY, I'M NOT PICKY.

31:59.900 --> 32:02.300
UP TILL YESTERDAY
I WAS EATING OUT OF A TUBE.

32:05.500 --> 32:08.100
MMM! THESE ARE GOOD.

32:13.700 --> 32:17.600
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN THINNG
A LOT ABOUT HIM TODAY, AND YOU.

32:17.800 --> 32:19.100
WAKING UP IN THIS BED,

32:19.200 --> 32:21.800
THINKING I WAS ALEX,
I FELT ALONE.

32:21.800 --> 32:23.100
BUT, YOU KNOW,
THE THING THAT MADE IT OKAY

32:23.100 --> 32:27.300
WAS KNOWING THAT YOU AND DAD
ARE REALLY THERE FOR ME.

32:27.800 --> 32:29.100
YEAH.

32:29.600 --> 32:32.399
YEAH, WE WERE...

32:32.400 --> 32:35.800
SO LISTEN,
I HAVEN'T ASKED YOU YET.

32:35.900 --> 32:38.800
HOW DID WE EVEN GET INTO
THIS ACCIDENT?

32:40.200 --> 32:42.600
UM... WELL...

32:42.600 --> 32:44.100
OH, GOD, DANIEL,

32:44.100 --> 32:45.599
WAS IT MY FAULT?

32:45.600 --> 32:47.700
WAS I DRUNK?

32:47.700 --> 32:50.200
UH, IT WAS JUST, UH...

32:53.500 --> 32:54.500
A DEER.

32:54.500 --> 32:56.300
IT--IT LEAPT OUT
IN FRONT OF THE CAR,

32:56.300 --> 32:59.900
YOU SWERVED...
AND THAT WAS IT.

32:59.900 --> 33:01.800
WOW.

33:02.100 --> 33:04.000
WELL, AT LEAST
I SAVED A DEER.

33:05.100 --> 33:05.799
DAD!

33:05.800 --> 33:08.099
SO... HOW ARE WE?

33:08.100 --> 33:09.199
WE'RE GREAT.

33:09.200 --> 33:11.700
I WAS JUST TELLING DANIEL
I FEEL SO LUCKY TO HAVE YOU TWO

33:11.700 --> 33:13.200

33:44.900 --> 33:46.900
YEAH.
HOW'D YOU KNOW?

33:47.000 --> 33:49.100
I WAS AT
YOUR FATHER'S FUNERAL.

33:50.700 --> 33:53.100
YOU KNOW, HE SAVED MY LIFE,
RIGHT HERE IN THIS STORE.

33:57.300 --> 33:58.700
YOUR FATHER WAS A HERO.

34:01.800 --> 34:05.000
I DIDN'T KNOW
THIS WAS WHERE...
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.600
YOU SHOULD KNOW,
HE WAS A REALLY GOOD MAN.

34:07.900 --> 34:08.800
I BET YOU'RE
JUST LIKE HIM.

34:12.800 --> 34:15.400
NO... I'M NOT.

34:34.300 --> 34:35.900
THANKS, BETTY.

34:38.000 --> 34:39.800

34:51.900 --> 34:53.500
HELLO?

34:53.500 --> 34:55.699
DAD?
I'M COMING HOME.

34:55.699 --> 34:58.700
WHAT?
DID YOUR VISA COME THROUGH?
NO.

34:58.900 --> 35:03.100
I CAN'T WAIT ANYMORE.
THIS COULD TAKE MONTHS, A YEAR.

35:03.700 --> 35:06.500
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? DAD, NO.

35:06.500 --> 35:08.400
IF YOU GET CAUGHT, THEY'RE NOT
GONNA LET YOU BACK IN,

35:08.400 --> 35:10.500
AND YOU KNOW HOW THEY PACK
THOSTRUCKS WITH PEOPLE.

35:10.500 --> 35:13.499
YOU COULD DIE.
IT'S MY LIFE, BETTY.
THIS IS MY DECISION.

35:13.500 --> 35:15.299
NO, THESE ARE OUR LIVES, DAD--

35:15.300 --> 35:17.099
YOURS AND MINE
AND HILDA'S AND JUSTIN.

35:17.100 --> 35:20.400
 <i>MIJA,</i> I'VE MADE UP MY MIND.
I LEAVE TOMORROW NIGHT.

35:20.500 --> 35:24.100
DAD, PLEASE,
JUST DON'T DO ANYTHING YET.

35:29.400 --> 35:31.199
I KNOW HOW TO GET YOU HOME.

35:31.200 --> 35:33.500
Let me talk to the lawyer
one last time.

35:41.900 --> 35:43.500
4:58.

35:43.500 --> 35:45.800
YOU DO LIKE
TO CUT IT CLOSE.

35:49.600 --> 35:50.700
OH, AND THE PICTURES
THAT SANTOS

35:50.700 --> 35:53.800
TOOK OF HIMSELF AT THE GYM
DO NOT NEED TO BE FRAMED.

35:53.800 --> 35:56.900
OKAY, SO I'M KEEPING
ONE THING.

35:56.900 --> 35:58.000
YOU SHOULD
KEEP SOMETHING, TOO.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
JUST LOOK THROUGH
ALL THE STUFF

35:59.000 --> 36:01.399
AND FIND SOMETHING
THAT YOU REALLY LOVE, OKAY?

36:01.400 --> 36:02.800
OKAY.
OKAY.

36:04.900 --> 36:06.600
OKAY.

36:29.200 --> 36:31.499
LOOK, I NEVER SIGNED OFF
ON BRIGITTE LACOMBE.

36:31.500 --> 36:33.599
I THOUGHT WE AGREED IF
WE COULDN'T GET MARIO TESTINO,

36:33.600 --> 36:35.500
WE WOULDN'T DO THE SPREAD.

36:35.700 --> 36:37.300
I STILL LIKE
THE DAVID LaCHAPPELLE

36:37.300 --> 36:40.100
CHATEAU MARMONT PHOTOS
WE COULDN'T RUN LAST MONTH.

36:41.400 --> 36:42.300
YOU'RE RIGHT.

36:42.300 --> 36:44.899
YOU'RE BACK,
AND YOU ARE EDITOR-IN-CHIEF.

36:44.900 --> 36:46.800
I MADE A MISTAKE.

36:46.800 --> 36:48.000
IS THAT ALL?

36:51.800 --> 36:55.500
UH, YES... THAT IS ALL.

36:56.200 --> 36:59.300
OH, BETTY, I HEARD YOUR FATHER'S
COMING BACK ON THURSDAY.

36:59.300 --> 37:02.100
PLEASE GIVE HIM
MY REGARDS.

37:07.500 --> 37:08.800
WOW.

37:09.100 --> 37:12.500
THAT WENT SO MUCH BETTER
THAN I EXPECTED.

37:12.500 --> 37:13.900
BETTY, I CAN'T THANK YOU
ENOUGH.

37:13.900 --> 37:15.000
IF YOU HADN'T
GOTTEN THE BOOK,

37:15.000 --> 37:16.800
SHE WOULD'VE DONE
EXACTLY WHAT SHE WANTED.

37:16.800 --> 37:18.800
OH, I'M JUST DOING
MY JOB, DANIEL.

37:18.800 --> 37:21.700
NO, I MEAN,
WHEN EVERYTHING'S ON THE LINE,

37:21.900 --> 37:23.099
YOU'RE THE ONE PERSON HERE

37:23.100 --> 37:26.400
I CAN TRULY TRUST.

37:28.800 --> 37:30.200
YEAH.

37:44.300 --> 37:45.800
SWEETHEART?

37:45.800 --> 37:48.900
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH CAVALLI'S PEOPLE.

37:48.900 --> 37:51.800
HE IS DESIGNING YOU
A CHARCOAL GRAY,

37:51.800 --> 37:53.500
SINGLE BUTTON TUXEDO
FOR THE WEDDING.

37:53.500 --> 37:56.700
AND HE'S FLYING HIMSELF IN
FOR THE FITTING.

37:57.600 --> 38:00.400
LISTEN, DARLING, WITH ALEXIS
STILL IN THE HOSPITAL,

38:00.400 --> 38:02.800
I'M NOT SURE
A GIANPARTY

38:02.800 --> 38:04.800
WOULD BE APPROPRIATE
RIGHT NOW.

38:05.300 --> 38:08.300
WELL, YOU WANT ME TO CUT DOWN
THE SIZE OF THE WEDDING?

38:08.500 --> 38:10.900
I WANT TO POSTPONE
THE WEDDING.

38:13.300 --> 38:14.700
BECAUSE OF ALEXIS?

38:14.700 --> 38:19.000
I SPENT THE AFTERNOON WITH HER.
WE'RE STARTING TO BOND AGAIN.

38:21.500 --> 38:22.700
WELL...

38:23.600 --> 38:25.400
ISN'T THAT, UH, WONDERFUL?

38:28.500 --> 38:29.900
I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND.

38:30.900 --> 38:33.000
ALEXIS IS STILL COMING
TO TERMS WITH THE FACT

38:33.000 --> 38:35.999
THAT HER MOTHER AND I
ARE NO LONGER TOGETHER.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
I'M AFRAID IT MIGHT BE
A BIT MUCH FOR HER TO HEAR

38:38.000 --> 38:39.900
THAT I'M MARRYING
SOMEONE ELSE.

38:39.900 --> 38:42.399
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN TOLD HER
ABOUT ME?

38:42.400 --> 38:44.400
I WILL,
WHEN SHE'S READY.

38:48.900 --> 38:50.500
YOU STILL LOVE ME?

38:54.600 --> 38:57.400
ALWAYS.

38:57.400 --> 38:59.299
UH, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

38:59.300 --> 39:03.200
I HAVE TO GO CALL CAVALLI
AND HAVE HIM POSTPONE HIS TRIP.

39:07.300 --> 39:09.300
ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT?

39:11.000 --> 39:12.500
I'M FINE.

39:20.100 --> 39:21.199
AAH!

39:21.200 --> 39:23.100
AAH! AAH!

39:24.200 --> 39:26.300
AAH!

39:32.800 --> 39:33.900

39:35.500 --> 39:38.100

39:40.700 --> 39:44.699
WOW! COOL.
THAT'S--I'M SO HAPPY.

39:44.700 --> 39:46.800
YEAH?
WELL, TELL YOUR FACE.

39:46.800 --> 39:49.899
COME ON!
WE GOTTA PLAN A BIG PARTY!

39:49.900 --> 39:51.400
I KNEW IT WAS GONNA
WORK OUT.

39:51.400 --> 39:53.400
OH, I JUST KNEW IT!

39:55.700 --> 39:57.600
SO YOU GOT RID OF
SANTOS' THINGS?

39:57.600 --> 39:59.100
ARE YOU OKAY?

39:59.400 --> 40:01.600
YEAH, I'M OKAY.

40:02.600 --> 40:06.199
BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO LEARN
HOW TO LIVE WITH THAT.

40:06.200 --> 40:08.999
WOW. I LIKE IT.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.500
STRIKE.

40:11.800 --> 40:13.300
(laughs) I GOTTA GO PLAN
THE MENU.

40:13.300 --> 40:17.800
OOH, DO YOU THINK IT'S WRONG
IF WE ASK <i>PAPI</i> TO COOK?

40:18.200 --> 40:19.200
EH.

40:33.000 --> 40:33.600
HELLO.

40:33.600 --> 40:34.500

40:34.500 --> 40:35.900
YES, CAN I HELP YOU?

40:38.400 --> 40:40.000

40:45.900 --> 40:47.000
(man) HELLO?!

40:50.800 --> 40:52.500
WHO IS IT?

40:52.500 --> 40:53.800
(Henry) IT'S ME.

40:54.400 --> 40:55.599
HENRY?

40:55.600 --> 40:57.000
BETTY?

41:04.300 --> 41:06.700
CHRISTINA TOLD ME
ABOUT CHARLIE,

41:07.100 --> 41:09.000
THAT SHE CHEATED ON ME.

41:19.600 --> 41:22.000
THE BABY
MIGHT NOT BE MINE.

41:23.700 --> 41:25.500
OH, GOD, HENRY.

41:25.800 --> 41:27.100
YOU'VE BEEN DRINKING.

41:27.300 --> 41:28.700
YES, I HAVE.

41:29.600 --> 41:33.500
BUT...
I DRANK MILK FIRST TO...

41:33.900 --> 41:35.500
COAT MY STOMACH.

41:42.600 --> 41:43.900
BETTY...

41:46.300 --> 41:49.800
CHARLIE WAS THE ONLY REASON
WE COULDN'T BE TOGETHER.

41:50.100 --> 41:52.600
AND SHE'S NOT A REASON ANYMORE.

41:58.100 --> 42:00.100
I WANNA BE WITH YOU, BETTY.
