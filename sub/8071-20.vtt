00:08.476 --> 00:10.344
You guys can't write
off some of the stuff

00:10.444 --> 00:11.245
you've got down here.

00:11.345 --> 00:12.446
Why not?

00:12.546 --> 00:15.616
Those are all 100%
legitimate business expenses.

00:15.716 --> 00:20.521
$1,200 for a boob job?

00:20.621 --> 00:23.157
It's not a boob job.

00:23.257 --> 00:25.359
It's a breast reduction.

00:25.459 --> 00:26.627
We're taking it as a loss.

00:29.363 --> 00:31.132
I buy it.

00:31.232 --> 00:33.467
I, I don't think the IRS will.

00:33.567 --> 00:36.337
But it is medical,
so you can write

00:36.437 --> 00:38.372
it off as a personal deduction.

00:38.472 --> 00:39.273
Dynomite.

00:42.410 --> 00:47.047
Now, is this your
monthly balance?

00:47.148 --> 00:50.184
Because you seem to be
a little short on cash.

00:50.284 --> 00:51.452
Oh, you must be
on the wrong page.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.454
We're not short on cash.

00:53.554 --> 00:56.757
We actually have none.

00:56.857 --> 00:59.059
Um, what happened to all that
snowmobile repair work, Dan?

00:59.160 --> 00:59.960
Did it.

01:00.060 --> 01:00.861
Spent it.

01:02.896 --> 01:03.897
Well, look.

01:03.997 --> 01:07.235
I'll run all this stuff
through my computer.

01:07.335 --> 01:10.738
And when I have your returns
ready I'll give you a call.

01:10.838 --> 01:12.039
We'll go over everything.
- Thanks, Art.

01:12.140 --> 01:12.940
Thanks.

01:13.040 --> 01:14.308
Listen, what do we owe you?

01:14.408 --> 01:15.209
I could write you a check.

01:21.215 --> 01:22.950
You kill me, Dan.

01:23.050 --> 01:24.952
[theme music]

02:15.603 --> 02:16.704
Hey, Darlene.

02:16.804 --> 02:19.273
I heard that joke you
made up about Trudy Burke.

02:19.373 --> 02:20.208
It's really funny.

02:20.308 --> 02:21.175
Thanks.

02:21.275 --> 02:22.476
But the beauty
part is, it doesn't

02:22.576 --> 02:24.077
just have to be about Trudy.

02:24.178 --> 02:26.880
Works for any girl
with a mustache.

02:26.980 --> 02:29.683
Well, did you know
that Trudy heard it, too?

02:29.783 --> 02:30.784
Good.

02:30.884 --> 02:32.220
Maybe she'll pull a
comb through that thing.

02:35.589 --> 02:36.624
Another good one.

02:36.724 --> 02:37.958
Hey, you can tell her
that tomorrow when she's

02:38.058 --> 02:41.429
beating the crap out of you.

02:41.529 --> 02:43.531
What are you talking about?

02:43.631 --> 02:44.698
Hey, how about for
your next joke,

02:44.798 --> 02:48.236
you start making fun of
how big and mean she is?

02:48.336 --> 02:50.638
Well, she doesn't
know that joke is mine.

02:50.738 --> 02:52.406
Oh, did I forget to
tell you that your friend

02:52.506 --> 02:54.242
Stacy ratted you out?

02:54.342 --> 02:56.176
Well, why did she do that?

02:56.277 --> 02:58.979
So Trudy would let
her out of her locker.

02:59.079 --> 02:59.847
All right.

02:59.947 --> 03:02.650
So Trudy knows.

03:02.750 --> 03:05.219
But I mouth off to everybody.

03:05.319 --> 03:07.455
People love that about me.

03:07.555 --> 03:08.356
Oh, Darlene.

03:08.456 --> 03:09.723
Look on the bright side.

03:09.823 --> 03:13.627
I mean, you may really
like your new face.

03:13.727 --> 03:15.863
ROSEANNE: And man,
he is so smart.

03:15.963 --> 03:18.366
I mean, you know, he knows so
much stuff about like taxes

03:18.466 --> 03:19.267
and everything.

03:19.367 --> 03:21.869
I swear, it's fascinating.

03:21.969 --> 03:24.505
Taxes are fascinating?

03:24.605 --> 03:26.840
Well, not normally, you know.

03:26.940 --> 03:30.844
But when Art's talking about
it, I swear, you laugh, you cry.

03:33.581 --> 03:34.982
Not my type.

03:35.082 --> 03:36.784
Oh, you don't know that.

03:36.884 --> 03:39.853
Oh, you're telling me
I don't know my type?

03:39.953 --> 03:41.889
He's cute and he's funny.

03:41.989 --> 03:43.657
He looks like the
Lucky Charms guy.

03:46.894 --> 03:50.097
It's what's inside
that counts, Jackie.

03:50.197 --> 03:54.902
And inside, this guy has a
timeshare condo in Florida.

03:55.002 --> 03:57.438
Can we drop it, please?

03:57.538 --> 03:58.739
I've been trying to
tell you something?

03:58.839 --> 03:59.840
OK.

03:59.940 --> 04:00.240
But can I just say one
more thing about it?

04:00.341 --> 04:01.141
What?

04:01.241 --> 04:02.142
Why can't you date him?

04:02.242 --> 04:03.777
- Roseanne?
- All right.

04:03.877 --> 04:04.712
What do you want to tell me?

04:07.348 --> 04:11.352
I'm thinking about
going into therapy.

04:11.452 --> 04:12.853
You mean like a shrink?

04:12.953 --> 04:13.754
JACKIE: Yeah.

04:13.854 --> 04:14.688
Why?

04:14.788 --> 04:17.658
Well, there's
a lot of reasons.

04:17.758 --> 04:18.692
Like what?

04:18.792 --> 04:21.562
Oh, I just haven't
been happy lately.

04:21.662 --> 04:23.163
And with mom and
dad breaking up,

04:23.263 --> 04:24.565
it makes me start
thinking about how

04:24.665 --> 04:26.534
crazy our whole childhood was.

04:26.634 --> 04:29.670
And there's just a lot of
stuff I've got to deal with.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.271
Well, when would you start?

04:31.372 --> 04:33.574
Two months ago.

04:33.674 --> 04:34.542
What?

04:34.642 --> 04:35.709
I can't believe it.

04:35.809 --> 04:37.077
That stinks.

04:37.177 --> 04:38.612
I'm your sister
and you go and do

04:38.712 --> 04:41.281
something that major without
even talking to me first?

04:41.382 --> 04:42.350
Calm down.

04:42.450 --> 04:43.216
No.

04:43.317 --> 04:45.085
I'm really upset about this.

04:45.185 --> 04:46.454
I want to know how
come you could go talk

04:46.554 --> 04:47.921
to some stranger about
all your problems

04:48.021 --> 04:50.257
and you can't talk to me.

04:50.358 --> 04:52.560
Because when I
tell her my problems,

04:52.660 --> 04:54.194
we don't spend the
next hour talking

04:54.294 --> 04:55.863
about how that makes her feel.

05:01.068 --> 05:01.869
OK.

05:01.969 --> 05:02.903
I'm sorry.

05:03.003 --> 05:05.673
I guess it is a good idea, then.

05:05.773 --> 05:09.743
And I'm glad that you
told me about it, finally.

05:09.843 --> 05:10.644
You're welcome.

05:14.882 --> 05:16.149
You know, Art goes to therapy.

05:18.819 --> 05:19.620
DAN: Hey.

05:19.720 --> 05:20.988
Hey.

05:21.088 --> 05:21.922
DAN: Hey, listen.

05:22.022 --> 05:23.056
I had an idea about the shop.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.692
I'm not sure if
it's crazy or not.

05:24.792 --> 05:28.696
Well, let's run it by
Jackie and we'll find out.

05:28.796 --> 05:31.432
Roseanne.

05:31.532 --> 05:35.369
Does everybody have
to know about this?

05:35.469 --> 05:36.404
I was only going to tell Dan.

05:36.504 --> 05:37.805
It's a very personal thing.

05:37.905 --> 05:39.607
OK?
- Well, he's family.

05:39.707 --> 05:42.443
Well, I'm asking you to
try and keep it to yourself.

05:42.543 --> 05:43.343
OK.

05:43.444 --> 05:44.778
I won't tell Dan.

05:44.878 --> 05:45.679
All righty.

05:47.948 --> 05:48.749
OK.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.050
I'm going to take off now.

05:50.150 --> 05:52.820
I'll call you later.

05:52.920 --> 05:53.754
OK.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.756
So what's the idea
with the shop?

05:55.856 --> 05:59.427
Well, Arnie came by this
afternoon with a tattoo artist.

05:59.527 --> 06:02.663
He wants to rent part of
the shop. $300 a month,

06:02.763 --> 06:05.098
and he could bring
by a lot of bikers.

06:05.198 --> 06:05.999
A tattoo guy?

06:06.099 --> 06:07.468
I don't know.
- Well, listen.

06:07.568 --> 06:08.368
Don't worry about it.

06:08.469 --> 06:09.803
I didn't commit to anything.

06:09.903 --> 06:11.271
I'm going to call Art
and have him come down

06:11.371 --> 06:13.541
and check out the deal.

06:13.641 --> 06:15.476
Well, what's this guy like?

06:15.576 --> 06:16.777
Well, I didn't
talk to him much.

06:16.877 --> 06:19.346
But my take on it was that
he's a very talented artist

06:19.447 --> 06:21.081
who's paid his debt to society.

06:28.088 --> 06:29.022
I'll tell you what, Dan.

06:29.122 --> 06:30.891
Gil here, he's the
absolute best, man.

06:30.991 --> 06:32.560
People come to
him from all over.

06:32.660 --> 06:33.461
Ow.

06:33.561 --> 06:36.263
Dammit, you're hitting bone.

06:36.363 --> 06:37.665
Don't pay attention to me, guys.

06:37.765 --> 06:39.767
It's a lot easier than it seems.

06:39.867 --> 06:42.903
Actually, it's kind
of a macho thing.

06:43.003 --> 06:45.172
Oh, mommy.

06:45.272 --> 06:48.141
Excuse us one moment.

06:48.241 --> 06:50.611
What do you, what
do you think, Art?

06:50.711 --> 06:51.512
I don't know, Dan.

06:51.612 --> 06:53.146
I'm a financial agent.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.081
It's a good idea.

06:54.181 --> 06:56.984
But personally,
I've got to wonder

06:57.084 --> 06:59.587
about a guy who's covered
his entire body with tattoos.

06:59.687 --> 07:01.922
Yeah.

07:02.022 --> 07:03.356
Think he's got one on Mr. Winky?

07:09.429 --> 07:11.865
I don't really
want to know, Dan.

07:11.965 --> 07:14.468
Hey Danny, Check it out, man.

07:14.568 --> 07:15.803
- Nice work.
- Thanks.

07:15.903 --> 07:16.704
Want one?

07:16.804 --> 07:18.438
On the house.

07:18.539 --> 07:20.808
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

07:20.908 --> 07:21.842
Pretty tempting there, Gil.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.611
Maybe some other time.

07:23.711 --> 07:24.712
Come on, Dan.

07:24.812 --> 07:26.379
Get Roseanne's name on
the ole bicep there.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.649
The babes dig that.
- No need to, Arnie.

07:28.749 --> 07:31.118
I got a big chicken pox scar
on my arm, looks just like her.

07:37.891 --> 07:39.392
Hi.
What's going on?

07:39.493 --> 07:41.461
Hey, honey.
Say hello to Gil.

07:41.562 --> 07:42.663
Hey.
How you doing?

07:42.763 --> 07:43.564
Hi, Gil.

07:43.664 --> 07:44.832
He's the tattoo guy.

07:44.932 --> 07:47.801
No kidding?

07:47.901 --> 07:49.937
So, Art.

07:50.037 --> 07:52.640
Jackie, say hi to Art.
- How you doing, Art.

07:52.740 --> 07:53.807
Hi, Jackie.

07:53.907 --> 07:54.708
Hey.

07:54.808 --> 07:57.310
Anybody going to say hi to me?

07:57.410 --> 07:59.580
Well, we've got to go.

07:59.680 --> 08:03.383
Oh, I've got to try to get
some money out of Dan first.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.485
This might take a minute.

08:05.586 --> 08:06.654
I better be going, too.

08:06.754 --> 08:07.555
OK.

08:07.655 --> 08:09.557
Take it easy, Art.

08:09.657 --> 08:10.824
Uh, Jackie.

08:10.924 --> 08:14.094
I was wondering if I could
talk to you for a second?

08:18.899 --> 08:19.700
Sure.

08:30.377 --> 08:32.913
So, uh, how's it going?

08:33.013 --> 08:33.814
Great.

08:33.914 --> 08:34.715
You?

08:34.815 --> 08:36.083
Great, great.

08:36.183 --> 08:36.984
Tax season.

08:37.084 --> 08:37.951
Busy, busy.

08:38.051 --> 08:40.721
Oh, I bet.

08:40.821 --> 08:42.122
I hear you're a trucker.

08:42.222 --> 08:43.090
Yeah.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.058
That must be
really interesting.

08:45.158 --> 08:47.294
Well, that keeps me busy.

08:47.394 --> 08:49.763
As a matter of
fact, I get so busy

08:49.863 --> 08:52.099
sometimes that I
have very little time

08:52.199 --> 08:55.736
left for a social life.

08:55.836 --> 08:57.671
Sounds kind of lonely.

08:57.771 --> 09:00.540
Well, I figure if
you're OK with yourself,

09:00.641 --> 09:03.010
then you're OK with being alone.

09:03.110 --> 09:04.812
Yeah.

09:04.912 --> 09:06.046
I'm alone a lot, too.

09:06.146 --> 09:07.247
Yeah.

09:07.347 --> 09:11.018
And you seem to be dealing
really well with that.

09:11.118 --> 09:11.919
Sometimes.

09:12.019 --> 09:13.253
Sometimes.

09:13.353 --> 09:19.326
But I was thinking, maybe some
night when you're in town,

09:19.426 --> 09:20.861
we could go out to dinner.

09:20.961 --> 09:22.730
Uh-huh.

09:22.830 --> 09:26.700
Well, that would be nice.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.770
I tell you what.

09:29.870 --> 09:32.539
When things do start
to slow down for me,

09:32.640 --> 09:37.310
then why don't I
give you a call?

09:37.410 --> 09:40.180
Got it.

09:40.280 --> 09:45.452
Well, um, I'd better be going.

09:45.552 --> 09:48.889
Give, well, say goodbye for me.

09:48.989 --> 09:50.190
JACKIE: OK.

09:50.290 --> 09:54.527
It's really, it was really
nice running into you again.

09:54.628 --> 09:56.830
Oh, damn.

09:56.930 --> 10:01.034
So, what did Art want.

10:01.134 --> 10:05.338
You know, I don't think
that I've ever been as angry

10:05.438 --> 10:07.507
with you as I am right now.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.209
Well, sure you have.

10:09.309 --> 10:13.180
Art's a perfectly nice guy
and you forced me to hurt him.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.915
Well, you didn't
even give him a chance.

10:15.015 --> 10:18.185
I told you I didn't
want to go out with him.

10:18.285 --> 10:20.220
But you wouldn't
leave it at that.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.955
Well, just one dinner.

10:22.055 --> 10:23.190
I don't believe it.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.125
I'm standing here, right
here, right in front of you,

10:25.225 --> 10:28.195
and you're not listening to
a single word I'm saying.

10:33.533 --> 10:34.434
Oh, yeah.

10:34.534 --> 10:36.503
You're therapy's
working out real good.

10:54.621 --> 10:56.523
What?

10:56.623 --> 11:00.260
You still getting
beat up today?

11:00.360 --> 11:01.695
Shut up.

11:01.795 --> 11:03.263
You're eating too much.

11:03.363 --> 11:05.532
You'll barf.

11:05.632 --> 11:06.734
Listen.

11:06.834 --> 11:08.068
Just because you followed
us home from the circus

11:08.168 --> 11:11.371
does not mean you
can talk to us.

11:11.471 --> 11:13.306
Hey.

11:13.406 --> 11:14.808
You should listen
to him, Darlene.

11:14.908 --> 11:18.011
He gets creamed like
every other week.

11:18.111 --> 11:19.980
Fall down early,
and stay down.

11:23.050 --> 11:24.084
I can handle this.

11:24.184 --> 11:25.719
You can't take her, Darlene.

11:25.819 --> 11:26.653
I'm not going to try.

11:26.754 --> 11:28.889
I'll just talk my way out of it.

11:28.989 --> 11:29.790
OK.

11:29.890 --> 11:32.726
Just stay down.

11:32.826 --> 11:34.928
You don't believe me?

11:35.028 --> 11:35.863
Dad?

11:35.963 --> 11:37.597
Can I talk to you
about something?

11:37.697 --> 11:38.498
DAN: Coming.

11:38.598 --> 11:39.399
Watch.

11:41.568 --> 11:42.369
Yeah, Darlene.

11:42.469 --> 11:43.570
Listen.

11:43.670 --> 11:46.740
I'm really sorry I called
you wide load yesterday.

11:46.840 --> 11:49.642
I meant to be funny and I
really thought you would laugh.

11:49.743 --> 11:51.879
But I've been thinking about it.

11:51.979 --> 11:55.582
Now I realize it was
really insensitive.

11:55.682 --> 11:58.685
Darlene, tie your hair
back real tight so she

11:58.786 --> 11:59.753
can't swing you around with it.

12:03.323 --> 12:05.625
You're dead, Darlene.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.060
Oh, man.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.128
Rope-a-dope, Darlene.

12:08.228 --> 12:09.329
Keep your arms up in
front of your face.

12:09.429 --> 12:10.764
Eventually, she'll
wear herself out.

12:15.769 --> 12:17.137
ROSEANNE: Are they gone yet?

12:17.237 --> 12:18.071
Yeah, honey.

12:18.171 --> 12:19.439
Good.

12:19.539 --> 12:21.141
I love them and everything,
but I just ain't in the mood.

12:23.743 --> 12:24.778
How's your headache?

12:24.878 --> 12:25.979
It's gone.

12:26.079 --> 12:26.880
JACKIE: Hey.

12:26.980 --> 12:27.781
It's back.

12:30.283 --> 12:32.920
Roseanne, we need to talk.

12:33.020 --> 12:34.154
We certainly do.

12:37.557 --> 12:38.558
Oh, boy.

12:38.658 --> 12:41.995
When's Dan going
to get out of here?

12:42.095 --> 12:42.896
See you later.

12:42.996 --> 12:43.797
Play nice.

12:47.734 --> 12:54.942
Well, I assume you're
here to apologize.

12:55.042 --> 12:57.710
I have spoken to
my therapist and she

12:57.811 --> 12:59.947
seems to think that it
would be a good idea if you

13:00.047 --> 13:02.082
came down to talk to her.

13:02.182 --> 13:02.983
Why?

13:03.083 --> 13:06.019
You're the nut.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.787
Well, she seems to think
that one of the reasons I

13:07.888 --> 13:10.623
may be a nut is because of you.

13:10.723 --> 13:12.826
What's that supposed to mean?

13:12.926 --> 13:16.496
Every time I talk to her,
your name keeps coming up.

13:16.596 --> 13:18.265
You're a very big
influence on me, Roseanne,

13:18.365 --> 13:19.867
and she seems to think
that she can help

13:19.967 --> 13:21.468
us sort some of this stuff out.

13:21.568 --> 13:22.435
What are you talking about?

13:22.535 --> 13:23.336
We had a fight.

13:23.436 --> 13:24.571
That's all.

13:24.671 --> 13:27.174
Oh, so you're not
going to come down?

13:27.274 --> 13:28.641
Well, I mean, is
she going to sit

13:28.741 --> 13:32.245
there and ask us all kind of
personal questions and stuff?

13:32.345 --> 13:34.214
Well, that is
sort of the point.

13:36.884 --> 13:37.717
OK.

13:37.817 --> 13:40.687
Well, let's get
our story straight

13:40.787 --> 13:41.588
before we go down there.

13:49.296 --> 13:51.298
Rosanne, first off, I'd
like to stress that we're

13:51.398 --> 13:52.299
all on the same side.

13:52.399 --> 13:55.435
So please don't feel defensive.

13:55.535 --> 13:56.904
OK.

13:57.004 --> 13:59.172
THERAPIST: And I'm not
a judge or a referee.

13:59.272 --> 14:00.874
You and I are both
here for one reason,

14:00.974 --> 14:02.575
and that's to help Jackie.

14:02.675 --> 14:03.476
Get her, doc.

14:06.746 --> 14:08.281
Nobody's here to get anybody.

14:08.381 --> 14:11.084
Nor are we here to try to solve
the problem in one session.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.819
Hey, I have no problem.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.087
OK?

14:14.187 --> 14:16.756
I'm just here to help out
Eleanor Rigby over there.

14:16.856 --> 14:17.657
Hey.

14:17.757 --> 14:18.858
Now, Roseanne.

14:18.959 --> 14:20.027
Oh, here's where
I get yelled at.

14:20.127 --> 14:21.161
No, no.

14:21.261 --> 14:22.996
I'd just like to set up
some boundaries here.

14:23.096 --> 14:26.066
In fact, let's just work on
listening without judging.

14:26.166 --> 14:27.767
Roseanne, I'm
going to ask Jackie

14:27.867 --> 14:29.202
to talk about how she feels.

14:29.302 --> 14:32.572
Now some of this may hurt, but
I don't want you to answer back.

14:32.672 --> 14:36.376
Instead, I want to repeat what
she said, in your own words.

14:36.476 --> 14:37.577
Will you try that?

14:37.677 --> 14:38.745
OK.

14:38.845 --> 14:39.846
THERAPIST: OK.

14:39.947 --> 14:41.348
Now Jackie, last session
we talked about how

14:41.448 --> 14:43.516
choices are difficult for you.

14:43.616 --> 14:47.554
Well, it's just
everything I do.

14:47.654 --> 14:49.489
I mean, I'm always wondering
what she's going to say

14:49.589 --> 14:51.959
because she's so judgmental.

14:52.059 --> 14:53.593
Can you be specific?

14:53.693 --> 14:55.262
Well, it's just everything.

14:55.362 --> 14:57.965
It's, if I'm going to be a
cop, what's she going to say?

14:58.065 --> 15:00.833
If I'm going to cut my
hair, is she going to laugh?

15:00.934 --> 15:02.169
If I go out with
this guy or this guy,

15:02.269 --> 15:03.903
or if I move out
of my apartment,

15:04.004 --> 15:05.939
or if I get a new outfit
or go to the movies

15:06.039 --> 15:07.174
or buy a book, or--

15:07.274 --> 15:08.708
it's just everything.

15:08.808 --> 15:10.277
OK.

15:10.377 --> 15:13.880
Now Roseanne, what did you
just hear, in your own words?

15:13.981 --> 15:15.782
Well, why would you want to
move out of your apartment?

15:15.882 --> 15:18.818
I mean, you pay really low rent.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.620
And that's really, it's
such a great place, really.

15:20.720 --> 15:21.754
You should see it.
- OK.

15:21.854 --> 15:23.256
OK.
Let's start over.

15:23.356 --> 15:27.794
Uh, and remember Roseanne,
I'm asking you not to judge

15:27.894 --> 15:30.097
her, just to listen to her.

15:30.197 --> 15:31.131
OK.

15:31.231 --> 15:33.033
But she doesn't have
to pay utilities.

15:33.133 --> 15:34.134
So what?

15:34.234 --> 15:35.568
You know, even if it
is a horrible mistake

15:35.668 --> 15:37.637
for me to move out of my
apartment, it's my mistake.

15:37.737 --> 15:39.372
I mean, people are
allowed to make mistakes.

15:39.472 --> 15:40.940
I'm not one of your children.
- Yeah.

15:41.041 --> 15:41.874
OK.

15:41.975 --> 15:43.043
Then you go make
a mistake, right,

15:43.143 --> 15:44.577
and then you come to
me to clean it up.

15:44.677 --> 15:45.478
Of course.

15:45.578 --> 15:47.147
You're my sister.

15:47.247 --> 15:48.681
Oh, oh, so I see.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.783
I'm not allowed to say
anything to stop the mistake,

15:50.883 --> 15:52.986
but then I have to
go mop it up after.

15:53.086 --> 15:54.887
Well, if you loved me,
I'd think you'd want to.

15:59.492 --> 16:00.427
You better call for backup.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.198
All right.

16:05.298 --> 16:06.099
All right.

16:06.199 --> 16:07.634
Let's try something different.

16:07.734 --> 16:08.868
Let's try a little exercise.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.270
Jackie, you go first.

16:10.370 --> 16:13.906
I want you to turn to Roseanne
and say, your my sister

16:14.007 --> 16:16.676
and I love you because,
and then fill in the rest.

16:16.776 --> 16:17.577
OK.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.251
What's taking you so long?

16:24.351 --> 16:25.152
I got it.

16:28.188 --> 16:32.492
You're my sister, and I love
you because you're strong.

16:32.592 --> 16:33.926
That's it?

16:34.027 --> 16:36.229
Well, it's not that easy.
You do it.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.065
OK, I will.

16:38.165 --> 16:42.235
You're my sister, and I
love you because you're

16:42.335 --> 16:46.873
warm and caring and giving
and nurturing and kind.

16:46.973 --> 16:48.175
But you know, your problem is--

16:48.275 --> 16:49.076
Hold up.

16:49.176 --> 16:50.677
Hold up.

16:50.777 --> 16:53.813
Try it without the but.

16:53.913 --> 16:55.148
OK.

16:55.248 --> 16:56.549
OK.

16:56.649 --> 16:59.386
You're my sister, and I love you
because we have shared so many

16:59.486 --> 17:00.720
things, although you always--

17:00.820 --> 17:04.324
Uh, that's another but.

17:04.424 --> 17:05.658
I don't like this game.

17:05.758 --> 17:07.994
Let's go back to
the listening deal.

17:08.095 --> 17:08.961
OK.

17:09.062 --> 17:09.962
We'll come back to this later.

17:10.063 --> 17:11.798
Jackie, your turn to listen.

17:11.898 --> 17:14.801
Roseanne, tell me, how do
you feel when you think

17:14.901 --> 17:16.669
Jackie is making a mistake?

17:16.769 --> 17:18.438
Well, I worry about her.

17:18.538 --> 17:19.572
Why?

17:19.672 --> 17:21.408
Well, because I don't
want her to get hurt.

17:21.508 --> 17:24.944
You know, and if I can see some
way of preventing that, well,

17:25.044 --> 17:26.713
then I'm going to say something.

17:26.813 --> 17:29.116
Jackie, in your own words?

17:29.216 --> 17:31.751
I mean, I know this Art
isn't gorgeous or anything,

17:31.851 --> 17:34.454
but he'd be really nice to
her and he'd protect her.

17:34.554 --> 17:35.488
You know what I mean?

17:35.588 --> 17:37.090
I mean, it wouldn't
be so awful to be

17:37.190 --> 17:39.025
married to a guy like that.

17:39.126 --> 17:42.229
So do you want her to be
married to a guy like that

17:42.329 --> 17:43.996
so he could take over for you?

17:44.097 --> 17:45.332
And then maybe you
wouldn't have to look

17:45.432 --> 17:48.335
out for Jackie any more?
- Are you kidding?

17:48.435 --> 17:49.936
What the hell does she
know about being married?

17:56.543 --> 17:57.344
OK.

17:57.444 --> 17:58.411
OK.

17:58.511 --> 18:00.147
The thing is, see--
well, I just didn't

18:00.247 --> 18:03.550
realize that I was treating
you like a kid all these years.

18:03.650 --> 18:05.585
Oh, please.

18:05.685 --> 18:07.454
OK.
I did realize it.

18:07.554 --> 18:11.391
I just didn't think you knew.

18:11.491 --> 18:12.959
At least you went
down there with me,

18:13.059 --> 18:16.062
and then we got to learn how
we can talk this stuff out.

18:16.163 --> 18:17.330
Yeah.

18:17.430 --> 18:20.800
Well, I want you to know
that it is really hard for me

18:20.900 --> 18:25.272
to dialogue with
you with a, without

18:25.372 --> 18:27.407
a confrontational agenda.

18:30.677 --> 18:31.978
I hear that.

18:32.078 --> 18:35.148
But you have got to learn how
to let go of your control issues

18:35.248 --> 18:40.487
without that triggering your
whole abandonment issue.

18:40.587 --> 18:42.755
I hear that.

18:42.855 --> 18:47.794
Now, there's one
thing I want to say

18:47.894 --> 18:53.266
to you in a totally
non-manipulative

18:53.366 --> 18:57.904
and non-judgmental context.

18:58.004 --> 18:58.805
I'm hearing that.

19:02.074 --> 19:03.376
OK.

19:03.476 --> 19:11.451
The responsibility that I feel
towards you is all your fault.

19:11.551 --> 19:13.753
How?
[phone ringing]

19:13.853 --> 19:15.922
Oh, I'm sorry.

19:16.022 --> 19:18.991
Our time is up.

19:19.091 --> 19:20.427
Sheeze.

19:20.527 --> 19:21.761
Hello?

19:21.861 --> 19:24.964
Oh yeah, just a minute.

19:25.064 --> 19:27.300
Dan, phone.

19:27.400 --> 19:30.637
I want you to know,
it's Art on the phone,

19:30.737 --> 19:33.039
and I'm not saying a thing.

19:33.139 --> 19:34.574
Good.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.175
And I'm really going
to try to ease up on you,

19:36.276 --> 19:37.844
although it's very, very hard.

19:37.944 --> 19:41.314
And I'm going to try and
remember that you mean well.

19:41.414 --> 19:44.817
So, you want to go
to therapy any more?

19:44.917 --> 19:45.852
You want to?

19:45.952 --> 19:46.753
Yeah, if you do.

19:46.853 --> 19:48.288
Yeah, thanks.

19:48.388 --> 19:49.722
Who is it?

19:49.822 --> 19:51.658
Mr. Right.

19:51.758 --> 19:52.559
Hey, Art.

19:52.659 --> 19:54.594
Oh, boundaries.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.863
We had boundaries.

19:56.963 --> 19:58.197
Oh, it was just a joke.

19:58.298 --> 20:00.733
You're busting the boundaries.

20:00.833 --> 20:02.802
I hear you, and I'm sorry.

20:02.902 --> 20:03.703
No.

20:03.803 --> 20:04.604
No.

20:04.704 --> 20:05.672
That's it.

20:05.772 --> 20:07.073
I'm out of here.

20:07.173 --> 20:09.276
Well, are you going to
be back in time for dinner?

20:09.376 --> 20:10.176
OK.

20:12.479 --> 20:13.313
All right, Art.

20:13.413 --> 20:15.014
Yeah, thanks.

20:15.114 --> 20:17.250
Well, we might have
lose the tattoo guy.

20:17.350 --> 20:18.217
Why for?

20:18.318 --> 20:19.552
Our insurance
company won't cover

20:19.652 --> 20:21.821
him unless we pay a lot more.

20:21.921 --> 20:26.225
It's a shame, too, because
he does such nice work.

20:26.326 --> 20:27.827
Wow.

20:27.927 --> 20:29.529
It's permanent.

20:29.629 --> 20:33.700
Just for you, because you
are permanent in my life.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.835
Yeah, well, my
name's Roseanne.

20:35.935 --> 20:37.036
I call you Rose all the time.

20:37.136 --> 20:38.438
You never call me Rose.

20:38.538 --> 20:39.772
Well, the guy
stopped in the middle.

20:39.872 --> 20:41.007
- Why?
- It hurt.

20:45.345 --> 20:46.212
God, Dan.

20:46.313 --> 20:47.847
Well, how about Rosie?

20:47.947 --> 20:48.915
I could make it Rosie.

20:49.015 --> 20:58.558
I can handle a little Y.

20:58.658 --> 20:59.559
OK.

20:59.659 --> 21:01.794
Again, remember we're
here for Jackie.

21:01.894 --> 21:02.929
Now who wants to start?

21:07.900 --> 21:08.935
I guess I'll go first.

21:11.638 --> 21:14.607
If you're married to the
same woman for 19 years,

21:14.707 --> 21:18.077
isn't that proof enough
that you love her?

21:18.177 --> 21:20.212
You know, Arlene, he
has some other woman's

21:20.313 --> 21:21.614
name tattooed on his arm.

21:21.714 --> 21:22.749
It's your name.

21:22.849 --> 21:25.051
It is not my name.

21:25.151 --> 21:27.186
It is Mrs. Kennedy's name.

21:31.658 --> 21:32.925
I can't believe this.

21:33.025 --> 21:34.427
I'm paying for this session.

21:34.527 --> 21:35.862
You guys aren't
here for me at all.

21:35.962 --> 21:38.698
You're just here to work out
all your own family crap.

21:38.798 --> 21:40.099
DARLENE: Excuse me.

21:45.872 --> 21:49.776
I don't mean to interrupt, but
it's time for my medication.
