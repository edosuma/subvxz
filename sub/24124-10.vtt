WEBVTT

00:00.291 --> 00:03.375
I gotta get goin'

00:03.375 --> 00:06.875
a friend of mine

00:08.500 --> 00:11.458
he's just Pooh Bear

00:14.125 --> 00:17.583
chasin' some honeybees

00:17.583 --> 00:21.000
I know he's out there

00:24.458 --> 00:27.875
we're so adventurous

00:27.875 --> 00:31.333
and again

00:31.333 --> 00:34.833
and there's nobody home

00:34.833 --> 00:38.250
to count on a friend

00:38.250 --> 00:41.708
Winnie the Pooh Bear

00:43.833 --> 00:45.250
take me, please?

00:45.250 --> 00:48.708
I got to be there

00:50.583 --> 00:55.875
Winnie the Pooh

01:18.708 --> 01:22.208
You take advantage
of me, will you? Hmm.

01:22.208 --> 01:26.708
Well, I'll show you,
you flying feather dusters.

01:27.833 --> 01:30.708
There. Carrot-stealing crows.

01:30.708 --> 01:33.375
They'll find out
who's boss around here.

01:33.375 --> 01:35.500
- Piglet: Hello, Rabbit.

01:35.500 --> 01:37.875
And a very,
very good morning to you.

01:39.333 --> 01:41.875
Huh. What's good about it?

01:41.875 --> 01:45.416
Uh, it's a good day for me
to come borrow a cooking pot?

01:45.416 --> 01:46.875
Please?

01:46.875 --> 01:49.083
Ooh!

01:49.083 --> 01:52.125
First the crows, now Piglet.

01:52.125 --> 01:54.458
Where have I gone wrong?

01:54.458 --> 01:56.333
Uh, actually, Rabbit,

01:56.333 --> 01:58.750
it's for something
very, very important.

01:58.750 --> 02:01.458
Well, that's a relief.

02:01.458 --> 02:04.958
So you only came over
to borrow something,
did you?...

02:06.333 --> 02:07.875
In that case, Piglet,

02:07.875 --> 02:10.583
by all means
help yourself.

02:10.583 --> 02:11.833
Thank you, Rabbit.

02:12.833 --> 02:14.583
"Thank you, Rabbit," he says.

02:14.583 --> 02:16.750
Never "Come for lunch, Rabbit"

02:16.750 --> 02:20.333
or "Here's a little story
for you, Rabbit"

02:20.333 --> 02:23.708
or "Can I help, Rabbit?"

02:23.708 --> 02:26.958
No. Only "Thank you,
Rabbit"

02:26.958 --> 02:30.125
for something
that I'm lending him.

02:30.125 --> 02:31.333
Oof!

02:31.333 --> 02:33.000
Hiya, bunny boy.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.625
Uh, kind of early
for a snooze, ain't it?

02:35.625 --> 02:38.458
Or are you just
laying down on the job?

02:39.583 --> 02:42.166
Get it? Laying down? Ha ha ha!

02:42.166 --> 02:44.708
Actually, Tigger,
I was--

02:44.708 --> 02:47.458
Say, it looks like
somebody snatched a scare

02:47.458 --> 02:49.000
out of your crow.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.125
Actually, I was--

02:50.125 --> 02:51.166
Oh, don't worry, fuzz buddy.

02:51.166 --> 02:53.083
I didn't come here to help.

02:53.083 --> 02:55.333
Well, that's comforting.

02:55.333 --> 02:58.708
Why I really came
was to borrow, uh, uh,

02:58.708 --> 03:00.375
well, it's a sort of a, uh--

03:00.375 --> 03:01.625
A whatdoyoucallwho?

03:01.625 --> 03:04.875
Yeah, yeah, that's it.
A thingamabob.

03:04.875 --> 03:07.375
Help yourself, Tigger!

03:07.375 --> 03:10.250
Take what you need
from my house.

03:10.250 --> 03:11.833
Oh, thanks, fluff face.

03:11.833 --> 03:14.458
Well, TTFN: ta-ta for now.

03:14.458 --> 03:15.875
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

03:15.875 --> 03:17.458
Borrow, borrow, borrow.

03:17.458 --> 03:19.375
That's all
anyone wants from me.

03:19.375 --> 03:22.333
Do they ever
offer to help? No!

03:26.000 --> 03:28.375
-

03:30.833 --> 03:36.000
All right, you flea-bitten
excuses for birds,

03:36.000 --> 03:37.583
raah!

03:42.708 --> 03:46.625
Take that,
you cackling buzzards.

03:46.625 --> 03:48.708
Whooh!

03:50.416 --> 03:53.875
Raah ha ha ha ha!

04:06.208 --> 04:09.125
Uh, I don't like
the looks of this.

04:09.125 --> 04:12.500
Oh, boy, that Rabbit.
What a guy.

04:12.500 --> 04:15.000
Never too busy
to help a friend.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
Yeah. And he never
even asks for our help.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.625
Help!

04:26.125 --> 04:27.458
Ohh.

04:27.458 --> 04:30.583
Why does this
always happen to me?

04:37.833 --> 04:39.250
Hello, Rabbit.

04:39.250 --> 04:41.708
I have come
to borrow some honey.

04:41.708 --> 04:45.583
Help yourself, Pooh.
Everyone else is.

04:51.583 --> 04:55.125
Yummy.

04:56.625 --> 04:58.708
Oh, bother.

05:04.291 --> 05:07.291
Oh, my. Oh, bother.

05:14.958 --> 05:17.208
Oh. Another bother.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.125
Bother.

05:23.125 --> 05:25.208
Oh, bother, bother.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.708
Perhaps a nap
under a shady tree

05:34.708 --> 05:36.333
would help now.

05:39.458 --> 05:43.166
I'll show you.
Get this going.

05:54.208 --> 05:55.250
What in the--

06:12.416 --> 06:14.000
Oh, bother.

06:16.500 --> 06:18.250
What?

06:18.250 --> 06:19.750
They're flying away.

06:21.750 --> 06:25.166
I did it! I scared them off
all by myself!

06:25.166 --> 06:27.583
Whoo hoo hoo!
I must tell Pooh.

06:27.583 --> 06:29.416
Uh, Pooh!

06:29.416 --> 06:31.875
Pooh! I did it! I--

06:33.083 --> 06:34.333
Well.

06:34.333 --> 06:36.375
Here I've done
something wonderful,

06:36.375 --> 06:38.875
and there's no one around
to tell it to.

06:38.875 --> 06:40.708
I--

06:40.708 --> 06:45.583
Isn't that just like Pooh
to eat and eat and eat

06:45.583 --> 06:47.500
and run?

06:47.500 --> 06:49.875
My, look at that.

06:49.875 --> 06:52.416
I don't believe it.

06:52.416 --> 06:54.458
It's my birthday.

06:54.458 --> 06:56.291
Pooh must have seen it

06:56.291 --> 06:58.958
and rushed off
to tell the others.

06:58.958 --> 07:00.000
Ha ha ha!

07:01.333 --> 07:02.958
In fact-- ho ho--

07:02.958 --> 07:05.583
they all must be planning
my birthday party

07:05.583 --> 07:07.708
this very minute. Hoo hoo hoo!

07:07.708 --> 07:11.458
Shh! My surprise
birthday party.

07:11.458 --> 07:14.291
I think I'll do
a little sneaking--

07:14.291 --> 07:18.708
I mean pre-party
investigating.

07:23.708 --> 07:26.875
I'll just take
a teensy-weensy peek

07:26.875 --> 07:28.833
inside Piglet's house

07:28.833 --> 07:33.458
and see what
the charming little
fellow is up to

07:34.458 --> 07:36.333
Oh. Ha ha ha!

07:36.333 --> 07:40.625
Looks like Piglet is
cooking up something
scrumdiliumptious.

07:40.625 --> 07:42.833
Probably
a giant birthday cake.

07:42.833 --> 07:46.375
Oh, I can hardly wait!

07:50.750 --> 07:53.416
Well, now, that should do it.

07:53.416 --> 07:55.083
Ha ha. Nothing
like boiling your clothes

07:55.083 --> 07:57.333
to get them really clean.

08:02.291 --> 08:06.375
Oh, hello, there, Tigger,
my good-- no, no, no--

08:06.375 --> 08:09.833
my very best friend.

08:10.833 --> 08:12.375
Shh. Shh.

08:12.375 --> 08:13.750
I got a whatsamajigger

08:13.750 --> 08:15.458
cornered
up this here tree.

08:15.458 --> 08:19.333
Oh. But I thought you
borrowed one from my house.

08:19.333 --> 08:21.291
No, that's a whoosits.

08:21.291 --> 08:23.291
You use those to catch
a whatchamadingle.

08:23.291 --> 08:25.083
Oh, I--

08:25.083 --> 08:27.583
I understand
quite completely, Tigger.

08:27.583 --> 08:30.583
Yes. Ha ha ha!
Yes, a whosaladiddle--

08:30.583 --> 08:33.208
most terrifying.

08:33.208 --> 08:37.375
Most likely
a surprise birthday present

08:37.375 --> 08:38.875
hidden up that tree.

08:38.875 --> 08:41.250
Ohh hoo hoo! Ho ho!
I'm so happy!

08:41.250 --> 08:42.458
Ha ha ha!

08:44.583 --> 08:47.166
Oh, my, whatever is that?

08:53.875 --> 08:56.375
Ah. Hello, there, creature.

08:56.375 --> 08:59.583
Hmm? Creature? Where?

08:59.583 --> 09:05.375
Excuse me, sir, but you are
a monster, aren't you?

09:06.416 --> 09:10.500
Oh. No. I'm a Pooh bear.

09:10.500 --> 09:12.375
A cake and a present.

09:12.375 --> 09:15.250
Ooh! I've got a cake
and a present.

09:15.250 --> 09:18.250
Why, look at that.

09:18.250 --> 09:20.583
Owl is decorating
Pooh Bear

09:20.583 --> 09:22.875
for my surprise
birthday party.

09:22.875 --> 09:25.708
Whoo-hoo! I can hardly wait.

09:25.708 --> 09:28.208
Decorations,
cakes, and presents.

09:34.375 --> 09:37.708
Oh, how nice to be home.

09:38.875 --> 09:42.875
Ahem. I hope
I'm not surprised!

09:44.416 --> 09:48.750
Ah. Well, here I am home.

09:53.583 --> 09:56.875
I said I'm home.

09:58.416 --> 09:59.500
It's me!

10:00.833 --> 10:03.958
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

10:09.875 --> 10:12.833
They forgot my birthday.

10:14.958 --> 10:17.708
And after all
I've done for them.

10:17.708 --> 10:22.875
Borrow, take, and not as much
as a birthday in return.

10:22.875 --> 10:28.583
Why, they just don't realize
what a special friend I am.

10:28.583 --> 10:32.708
Why, if they didn't have me,
I wouldn't be here.

10:32.708 --> 10:34.208
Have they thought of that?

10:34.208 --> 10:35.583
No!

10:35.583 --> 10:39.291
Well, I'll show them all.

10:39.291 --> 10:41.583
I'll go someplace far away,

10:41.583 --> 10:45.125
someplace where I'll
really be special.

10:50.583 --> 10:54.291
Looks like Rabbit's
going on vacation.

10:54.291 --> 10:57.458
Just like him
not to invite me along,

10:57.458 --> 10:59.875
thank you very much.

10:59.875 --> 11:02.166
Suppose I ought
to tell the others

11:02.166 --> 11:04.208
they weren't invited,
either.

11:10.458 --> 11:13.166
Well. Well, well, well.

11:13.166 --> 11:16.583
I'm on my way already.

11:39.625 --> 11:42.250
Hey, what's the big idea?

11:42.250 --> 11:47.416
Never have I seen such
an extra special rabbit.

11:51.416 --> 11:53.708
I'm going to put him
center stage,

11:53.708 --> 11:55.875
where someone's
sure to see him,

11:55.875 --> 11:59.166
buy him, and give him
a good home.

12:02.083 --> 12:05.291
Ah. Special at last.

12:05.291 --> 12:09.708
Huh. None of these other toys
have a sign like mine.

12:09.708 --> 12:12.708
I knew I wasn't
appreciated back home.

12:12.708 --> 12:17.708
Hey! How come we don't
have a sign like that?

12:17.708 --> 12:21.708
Because he does,
vacuum head.

12:25.583 --> 12:29.291
But not for long.
Just wait until dark

12:29.291 --> 12:31.291
when the shop closes.

12:31.291 --> 12:34.583
Nobody's going
to buy that rabbit

12:34.583 --> 12:37.500
without buying us
first.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.583
Hello.

12:46.583 --> 12:51.583
Shush. Be very quiet, Eeyore.

12:51.583 --> 12:53.458
We're hunting flutterbies.

12:53.458 --> 12:56.583
Oh, and I thought
you were shushing me

12:56.583 --> 12:58.875
because I said hello.

12:58.875 --> 13:01.416
Not that I blame you

13:01.416 --> 13:02.750
for shushing me.

13:02.750 --> 13:05.000
It's not like I do
interesting things

13:05.000 --> 13:06.458
like Rabbit

13:06.458 --> 13:08.583
and run away
and hitch a ride

13:08.583 --> 13:11.583
in an old truck
heading towards town.

13:11.583 --> 13:13.750
Rabbit ran away?

13:13.750 --> 13:14.958
Eeyore: Not that I--

13:14.958 --> 13:16.833
Pooh, we've got
to find Rabbit.

13:16.833 --> 13:18.583
Right.

13:18.583 --> 13:24.416
Uh, if I may ask,
where do we begin looking?

13:24.416 --> 13:25.958
In town.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.291
Rabbit!

13:30.291 --> 13:32.625
Rabbit, where are you?

13:32.625 --> 13:34.291
Hello, Rabbit!

13:36.208 --> 13:38.208
Hey, bunny boy!

13:39.208 --> 13:40.625
Uh, R-Rabbit.

13:40.625 --> 13:44.000
All: Rabbit!

13:47.000 --> 13:50.125
Whew. Rabbit hunting
is exhaustiperating.

13:50.125 --> 13:51.958
I wonder where he is.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.583
That's remarketable.

13:56.583 --> 13:58.708
That guy
looks just like Rabbit.

13:58.708 --> 13:59.875
Maybe he'd know.

13:59.875 --> 14:01.583
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

14:01.583 --> 14:03.000
You can't fool a tigger.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.500
Ha ha! That is Rabbit.

14:05.500 --> 14:08.291
Hey, bunny boy!
It's me! Tigger!

14:08.291 --> 14:09.708
T-I-double Guh--

14:09.708 --> 14:11.000
Sorry.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.750
I don't know any tiggers.

14:12.750 --> 14:16.333
- You don't?
- No poohs or piglets, either.

14:16.333 --> 14:20.166
Uh, are you sure?
We seem to know you.

14:20.166 --> 14:24.583
All they do, tiggers included,
is borrow from me.

14:24.583 --> 14:27.875
They don't know how
to treat a rabbit special.

14:27.875 --> 14:29.875
Oh, uh, sorry, long ears.

14:29.875 --> 14:31.875
Uh, I didn't think
you felt like that.

14:31.875 --> 14:35.166
Huh, and us worrying
all about you and everything.

14:36.166 --> 14:37.583
Uh, Rabbit?

14:37.583 --> 14:39.750
He was just here a minute ago.

14:39.750 --> 14:43.333
Christopher Robin!

14:43.333 --> 14:46.125
Hey, guys, I found Rabbit!

14:47.208 --> 14:49.500
I don't see him, Tigger.

14:49.500 --> 14:50.958
Me, neither.

14:50.958 --> 14:53.583
I know, I know, but he
was there a minute ago,

14:53.583 --> 14:56.291
wearing a big "special" sign.

14:56.291 --> 14:58.708
Well, there's only
one thing to do.

14:58.708 --> 15:00.250
We shall have to go in there

15:00.250 --> 15:02.458
and apologize
for not treating him

15:02.458 --> 15:06.416
as special as a special
rabbit should be treated.

15:06.416 --> 15:08.291
We can't, Pooh.

15:08.291 --> 15:10.250
Say. How come? Why not?

15:10.250 --> 15:12.083
Where does it say that?

15:12.083 --> 15:15.083
Right here, Tigger.
They're closed.

15:15.083 --> 15:17.458
Uh, what do we do now?

15:17.458 --> 15:20.458
We come back tomorrow
and buy him back.

15:20.458 --> 15:22.458
Buy Rabbit?

15:22.458 --> 15:24.583
Yes, Pooh. We got to

15:24.583 --> 15:27.291
before someone else does.

15:31.250 --> 15:35.708
Okay, fluff and stuff,
hand over the tag.

15:35.708 --> 15:39.083
Uh, tag? What tag?

15:39.083 --> 15:43.708
This tag. We been in here
a long, long time, see?

15:43.708 --> 15:46.250
And no kid ever
wanted to buy us.

15:46.250 --> 15:48.833
First day you get
that thing on, whammo.

15:48.833 --> 15:50.750
Knee deep in customers.

15:50.750 --> 15:54.458
Oh. You want this tag.

15:55.833 --> 15:58.458
Oh, well, why didn't
you say so?

15:58.458 --> 16:01.000
I thought
you meant that tag.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.583
Hey, I don't see any--

16:03.583 --> 16:06.458
What the-- After him, boys!

16:06.458 --> 16:08.875
He's got our ticket
out of here.

16:08.875 --> 16:11.708
Never! I'll never
give up my tag.

16:11.708 --> 16:14.458
Christopher Robin's
going to buy me.

16:19.291 --> 16:21.333
Whew. Thanks for catching me.

16:21.333 --> 16:22.875
Don't mention it.

16:23.958 --> 16:25.125
Aah!

16:26.750 --> 16:28.291
Mama.

16:28.291 --> 16:30.166
Aah!

16:30.166 --> 16:31.875
We want that tag, see?

16:36.708 --> 16:39.708
Guess you guys
can't sleep, either, huh?

16:39.708 --> 16:43.583
Christopher Robin,
do you think your pennies

16:43.583 --> 16:45.833
have grown big enough
to buy Rabbit?

16:45.833 --> 16:48.000
I don't know, Pooh.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.416
- But I sure hope so.

16:50.416 --> 16:53.458
Oh, I wouldn't worry
about old bunny boy.

16:53.458 --> 16:56.416
He's probably having
the time of his life.

17:21.166 --> 17:22.583
Oh, dear. Oh, dear!

17:22.583 --> 17:24.416
Look out, Ted!

17:30.000 --> 17:32.875
I give up. I give up.

17:32.875 --> 17:35.000
You can have the tag.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.583
About time.

17:38.875 --> 17:40.250
It's over there.

17:41.500 --> 17:45.208
Now I'm gonna get
bought by that kid.

17:47.875 --> 17:50.125
Ha ha! You're both wrong!

17:50.125 --> 17:52.500
- It's me.
- Give me that.

17:54.958 --> 17:56.375
It's mine.

17:56.375 --> 17:58.458
- I got it before!
- It's mine!

17:58.458 --> 18:01.083
- I saw it first!
- Wise guy, eh?

18:03.958 --> 18:06.416
Heh heh heh heh.
You just watch.

18:06.416 --> 18:10.083
When that kid comes back,
he'll buy all of us.

18:10.083 --> 18:13.166
No tag, no friends,

18:13.166 --> 18:15.583
and no Christopher Robin.

18:15.583 --> 18:17.958
I'm not special.

18:17.958 --> 18:20.583
I'm nothing at all.

18:22.875 --> 18:27.416
Hey. Heh heh.
Told you he'd be back.

18:27.416 --> 18:30.750
And we got
the sign, too.

18:35.583 --> 18:38.750
Please, sir,
how much is that rabbit

18:38.750 --> 18:41.958
that used to be
in the window?

18:41.958 --> 18:44.291
Oh, uh,
that special rabbit?

18:44.291 --> 18:47.750
Well, he's worth
a great deal,

18:47.750 --> 18:49.166
a great deal.

18:49.166 --> 18:51.875
I'm not sure if I have
enough pennies.

18:51.875 --> 18:55.000
See, I've been
letting them grow, so--

18:55.000 --> 18:58.083
so I could buy Rabbit
a birthday present.

18:58.083 --> 19:01.000
So they did remember.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.125
Are you sure about
wanting this rabbit?

19:04.125 --> 19:06.833
How about a nice
bicycle instead?

19:06.833 --> 19:09.458
Oh, no, sir.
I want my rabbit.

19:09.458 --> 19:10.958
Ah.

19:10.958 --> 19:14.166
I'm sorry.
You don't have enough.

19:17.708 --> 19:20.458
Hmm. I don't know.

19:21.875 --> 19:24.208
Uh, just a second.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.625
Great idea, Pooh.

19:30.625 --> 19:33.708
Uh, how about this?

19:33.708 --> 19:36.333
It's my pooh bear's
best honey.

19:37.708 --> 19:39.500
I don't know.

19:44.375 --> 19:46.333
It's from Piglet.

19:46.333 --> 19:47.458
Well...

19:49.000 --> 19:52.375
And this whatchamawhoosits,
my tigger caught it.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
Isn't this enough, sir?

19:57.000 --> 20:01.166
Hmm. This is all
very valuable stuff

20:01.166 --> 20:03.708
but just
not the right amount

20:03.708 --> 20:05.708
for such
a special rabbit.

20:06.833 --> 20:10.166
See? No sign, no sale.

20:10.166 --> 20:11.625
Heh heh heh heh heh.

20:11.625 --> 20:15.000
You don't have
anything else to add?

20:17.875 --> 20:21.708
I lost my rabbit.

20:21.708 --> 20:24.375
Uh, Christopher Robin.

20:27.458 --> 20:28.875
...for Rabbit.

20:28.875 --> 20:30.583
Of course. I forgot.

20:30.583 --> 20:33.000
The biggest thing of all.

20:34.125 --> 20:35.250
Yes?

20:35.250 --> 20:36.583
Please, sir,

20:36.583 --> 20:40.000
I'd like to add
a whole bunch of love.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.250
Ha ha ha. Well,

20:43.250 --> 20:45.583
now you're talking
business.

20:45.583 --> 20:46.875
Sold.

20:48.125 --> 20:49.708
Yahoo!

20:52.875 --> 20:56.708
Don't worry. Some day
you'll be special,

20:56.708 --> 21:00.083
and, uh, somebody
will buy you, too.

21:00.083 --> 21:02.875
Aw. You really think so?

21:02.875 --> 21:04.333
Sure.

21:18.708 --> 21:19.875
Uh--

21:19.875 --> 21:22.125
Surprise!

21:22.125 --> 21:24.958
All:
Happy birthday, Rabbit!

21:24.958 --> 21:28.125
But-- But my birthday
was last week.

21:28.125 --> 21:29.583
You forgot it.

21:29.583 --> 21:31.833
Last week?

21:31.833 --> 21:35.083
Rabbit, your calendar's
running fast.

21:35.083 --> 21:37.500
It's missing a whole week.

21:38.875 --> 21:40.708
Oh, what's this?

21:40.708 --> 21:42.750
More guests, perhaps?

21:46.708 --> 21:49.416
Why, you miserable
beak brains!

21:49.416 --> 21:50.875
I'll--

21:54.500 --> 21:55.958
For me?

21:55.958 --> 21:58.958
Why, thank you.

21:58.958 --> 22:00.583
Thank you, everyone.

22:00.583 --> 22:04.333
I feel so, uh, special.
