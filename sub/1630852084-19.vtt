00:00.801 --> 00:02.135

- Say, "I am."
- I am.

00:02.236 --> 00:03.470

- "Moving forward."
- Moving forward.

00:03.570 --> 00:04.505

- "I am!"
- I am!

00:04.605 --> 00:05.439

- "Nice!"
- Nice!

00:05.539 --> 00:06.673
- Apparently, Mr. Brown
told her

00:06.773 --> 00:08.041
that if she was nice
to us,

00:08.141 --> 00:09.910
that we would meet the boy.

00:10.010 --> 00:10.878
- Hit 'em with the turn!

00:10.978 --> 00:11.912
- I'm not meeting that boy!

00:12.012 --> 00:13.146
- Get out these
people's business.

00:13.247 --> 00:14.548
- Nobody say,
"Get out my business"

00:14.648 --> 00:16.717
when y'all needed me to talk
to that little girl.

00:16.817 --> 00:17.851
Nobody said,
"Mind your business"

00:17.951 --> 00:20.153
when y'all needed
my $40,000.

00:20.254 --> 00:21.421
Stop judging people.

00:21.522 --> 00:23.824
- Even more of a reason
why we should meet him?

00:23.924 --> 00:25.526
- Let it seem like
it was her idea.

00:25.626 --> 00:26.493
- Alright, you got it.

00:26.593 --> 00:27.761
- You'll get my bill
in the mail

00:27.861 --> 00:29.730
for $40,000.

00:29.830 --> 00:30.097
- ♪

00:36.579 --> 00:39.982
- Ooh, Cora, this is nice.
- It is. I mean, everything.

00:40.082 --> 00:41.917
I like how the colors
came together.

00:42.017 --> 00:43.619
- Yeah, I'm glad they
brought in

00:43.719 --> 00:44.820
all these extra workers.

00:44.920 --> 00:46.221
- They got all they dust
off of that.

00:46.322 --> 00:48.090
- Cora, I told you
that boy was grown.

00:48.190 --> 00:50.359
- Ooh, look at him.
- He picked up that whole piano

00:50.459 --> 00:51.794
by his self.

00:51.894 --> 00:53.929
- Mr. Brown, the piano rolls.

00:54.029 --> 00:55.598
- Well, he did it by his self.

00:56.966 --> 00:58.434
I thought that boy
was on that stuff.

00:58.534 --> 01:00.970
- Would you stop that?!
I don't wanna say that.

01:01.070 --> 01:03.505
- Y'all, this place looks
amazing.

01:03.606 --> 01:06.508
- It does, ooh,
it turned out so nice!

01:06.609 --> 01:07.509
- Oh, my goodness.

01:07.610 --> 01:09.511
- Look, look,
we got cameras, bam!

01:09.612 --> 01:12.014
- Ooh.
- Smile! Hey!

01:14.817 --> 01:15.818
There's lights all
under the TV.

01:15.918 --> 01:17.219
- Oh, my goodness,
look at that brick

01:17.319 --> 01:20.089
on that fireplace.
- Alright, now.

01:20.189 --> 01:22.424
- I like the patterings.
- It's classic.

01:22.524 --> 01:24.860
- The plaid with the stripes
and the patterings

01:24.960 --> 01:27.363
and everything.
- We know you like that.

01:27.463 --> 01:29.999
- We can get this--we can
get this place open and running.

01:30.132 --> 01:31.133
- Yes.
- Don't get too happy.

01:31.233 --> 01:33.636
We need to pass
inspection first.

01:33.736 --> 01:35.137
- We will.
- I hope so,

01:35.204 --> 01:36.672
'cause we need the money.

01:36.772 --> 01:38.140
- Y'all could give me back

01:38.240 --> 01:39.942
my $40,000.
- Here we go.

01:40.042 --> 01:42.478
Man, you know what?
Why you got to always

01:42.578 --> 01:44.146
bring up money?!

01:44.213 --> 01:45.281
- You're the one
that brought up money!

01:45.381 --> 01:47.216
- No, you're, "Give me
my $40,000."

01:47.316 --> 01:49.418
- Oh, when I say--
- VINNY: "Gimme my $40,000."

01:49.518 --> 01:51.153
- [indistinct arguing]
- Okay! Alright!

01:51.253 --> 01:53.222
- "Get me my $40,000, Cora!"

01:53.322 --> 01:55.057
- I didn't borrow no money--
- LEAH: Would you stop?

01:55.157 --> 01:56.959
- "Cora! Can I get
my $40,000?!"

01:57.059 --> 01:58.227
- Calm down.
- I'm listening.

01:58.327 --> 02:00.162
- Look, hey, hey!

02:00.262 --> 02:01.597
- Okay, what I--
- It's him!

02:01.697 --> 02:04.166
- What I'm gonna do is--
- Imma get the last word.

02:04.199 --> 02:05.634
- No.
- LEAH: Mm-mm!

02:05.734 --> 02:08.570
- What I will do is,
I'm gonna call the inspector

02:08.671 --> 02:10.372
so we can get our business
license, guys,

02:10.472 --> 02:12.174
so we can get this place open!

02:12.207 --> 02:14.243
To make money!
- Hmm.

02:14.343 --> 02:15.844
- Okay.
- Alright, okay.

02:15.945 --> 02:17.546
Look, I just wanna say
thank you

02:17.646 --> 02:19.281

get this place together.

02:19.381 --> 02:21.016
- You're welcome.
- You're quite welcome.

02:21.183 --> 02:24.186
Any time.
I'm here to help.

02:24.286 --> 02:26.021
- At least somebody
in this family got manners.

02:26.188 --> 02:27.856
She was talking to us.
- She was talking to me.

02:27.957 --> 02:29.858
- Dummy.
- Dumber.

02:29.959 --> 02:31.026

02:31.126 --> 02:33.028
- Well, I helped.
I did help.

02:33.128 --> 02:35.564
- Yeah, by spending
my inheritance.

02:35.664 --> 02:38.867
- Son, that was never
your money. Never.

02:38.968 --> 02:40.269
- Right, right, right,
whatever.

02:40.369 --> 02:42.338
Anyway, thank you,
Mr. Brown, Cora, so much.

02:42.438 --> 02:44.273

This place is beautiful,
it's gonna make

02:47.843 --> 02:49.144

03:05.227 --> 03:07.196
and a nice ride home
to the upper room.

03:07.296 --> 03:10.332
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, I like those words.

03:10.432 --> 03:12.167
We could use those words
in a commercial.

03:12.234 --> 03:13.969
- I like that, I like that.

03:14.069 --> 03:15.971
- Commercial?
- Yes, a commercial.

03:16.071 --> 03:17.506
We need a commercial

03:17.606 --> 03:20.242

no commercial money.

03:20.342 --> 03:21.410

I am the beauty
of this operation.

03:29.652 --> 03:32.454

greasy--

03:34.323 --> 03:36.558

03:36.659 --> 03:39.028
I didn't cuss.
I had thoughts of cussing.

03:39.128 --> 03:41.196
- We could do--thi--this

03:41.297 --> 03:42.698

04:09.933 --> 04:12.702

- Yes, I look human,
unlike yourself.

04:12.802 --> 04:14.437

04:14.538 --> 04:17.140

raising kids.

04:33.657 --> 04:37.394

- [blows air]

04:37.494 --> 04:38.862

- What?
- We gon' do it.

04:38.962 --> 04:40.530

04:42.399 --> 04:45.035
- Yeah, you do.
But you know what?

04:45.135 --> 04:48.171
Personally,
I think it's a good idea.

04:48.271 --> 04:49.539
- I mean, I do too, but,
you know,

04:49.639 --> 04:51.575
I had to kinda convince
my husband

04:51.675 --> 04:53.410
'cause he wasn't so sure
about that.

04:53.510 --> 04:56.079
- Well, I think it's good
to know who your kids are.

04:56.179 --> 04:57.380
- Cora, I'm with you
when you're right.

04:57.480 --> 04:59.149
I like the way you think.
- [giggles]

04:59.249 --> 05:01.218
Well, thank you.
Thank you.

05:01.318 --> 05:03.053
- See, that's what I'm trying
to get him to see.

05:03.153 --> 05:04.154
- Okay.
- We're gon' let her

05:04.254 --> 05:06.223
bring it up, natural,
you know.

05:06.323 --> 05:07.624
- That's good,
that sounds good.

05:07.724 --> 05:10.627
Long as they know that you
are the rulers of the house,

05:10.727 --> 05:11.761
that's all that matters.

05:11.862 --> 05:14.731
- I don't know if she knows
all that yet.

05:14.764 --> 05:16.733
But...she's learning.

05:16.766 --> 05:18.869
- [chuckles]
Well, you're learning too.

05:18.969 --> 05:20.303
We're all learning.

05:20.403 --> 05:22.072
- I know, Cora, thank you.
- You're welcome.

05:22.172 --> 05:24.107
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

05:24.207 --> 05:27.777
- Hello! This is Leroy A. Brown.

05:27.878 --> 05:30.914
And the A is for "Assisting
your loved ones

05:31.014 --> 05:33.450
in their final days."

05:33.550 --> 05:35.619
- What is he doing?
- I don't know, but--

05:35.752 --> 05:39.890
- This is my brand-new
facility that we just opened up,

05:39.990 --> 05:41.358
and they did a fine job.

05:41.458 --> 05:43.093
- Mr. Brown, what are you doing?

05:43.193 --> 05:44.294
- Cora, I'm drumming up
business.

05:44.394 --> 05:45.562
- Put that camera down.

05:45.662 --> 05:48.398
- That's Cora. Say "Hey," Cora.
- Put--

05:48.498 --> 05:50.300
- I'm on livestream, say hi.
I'm live.

05:50.400 --> 05:53.470
- Put that down!
- Bring us all your loved ones.

05:53.570 --> 05:56.072
The ones who can no longer
assist themselves,

05:56.173 --> 05:57.774
we will help them.

05:57.807 --> 06:00.243
This is one of our seniors
right here.

06:00.343 --> 06:03.480
- Get that out of my face!
You know I've got warrants!

06:03.580 --> 06:06.216
- He's a little ill,
but don't worry.

06:06.316 --> 06:08.218
- You know I'm wanted, man,
get that out of my face!

06:08.318 --> 06:10.554
I can't be seen!
- Don't be alarmed.

06:10.720 --> 06:12.722
Don't be alarmed,
he looks sick.

06:12.822 --> 06:14.824
- VINNY: You really--

06:14.925 --> 06:16.393
- But we love him.

06:16.493 --> 06:18.929
He look exactly like what
he been through.

06:19.029 --> 06:21.731
- No speak the English.

06:21.765 --> 06:24.234
- We will have a vacancy soon
'cause he won't be here long.

06:24.334 --> 06:25.836
- I hope he die.

06:27.170 --> 06:29.406
- Send them on out here
to Pleasant Days,

06:29.506 --> 06:33.844
where your days will be pleasant
and your rest will be in peace.

06:36.079 --> 06:37.447
Look at that.

06:37.547 --> 06:39.416
- We see you, Mr. Brown.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

06:39.516 --> 06:41.484
Did you just send that out?
- Oh, I was live.

06:41.585 --> 06:45.188
I was live on the thing there.
- What are you doing?

06:45.288 --> 06:46.890
- I'm trying to get some
business for the place.

06:46.990 --> 06:49.392
- Oh, yeah, okay,
by ruining us?

06:49.492 --> 06:52.195
- No! What you talking 'bout?
Cora said we needed, uh...

06:52.295 --> 06:54.030
to do a commercial,
so I'm doing a commercial.

06:54.130 --> 06:56.600
- Yes, a professional
commercial.

06:56.766 --> 07:00.203
- Well, we didn't have
no professional money.

07:00.303 --> 07:01.605
Y'all got a lot of creative
ideas,

07:01.771 --> 07:03.874
but y'all don't have no money.
- Mr. Brown!

07:03.974 --> 07:07.444
- Next time y'all have ideas,
have a check.

07:07.544 --> 07:09.746
- Mister--Mister Brown,
I can't believe you did that.

07:09.846 --> 07:11.848
- Oh, wait, he--it's alright,
child, it's okay.

07:11.948 --> 07:14.150
- Cora, it's not alright,
he could've ruined our business

07:14.251 --> 07:15.252
with that video.

07:15.352 --> 07:16.620
- Well, I don't think
he did that.

07:16.720 --> 07:17.721
- Well, why not?

07:17.821 --> 07:19.756
- 'Cause he only has three
followers.

07:19.856 --> 07:23.059
- Wait, what?
- He only has three followers.

07:23.159 --> 07:25.195
Him, me, and my mama.

07:25.295 --> 07:26.796
- [laughs]
- And he don't know

07:26.897 --> 07:30.634
how to follow nobody.
Y'all just calm down.

07:30.734 --> 07:32.235
- I'm 'bout to have wheelchairs

07:32.335 --> 07:34.571
and diapers
and canes everywhere.

07:34.738 --> 07:35.906
- [laughing]

07:36.006 --> 07:38.275
- We gon' have robots up
in this place. [imitates shots]

07:38.375 --> 07:40.544
- Would you stop that?

07:40.644 --> 07:43.380
- Well, clearly, he thinks he
has more than three followers.

07:43.480 --> 07:46.216
- He's delusional, a little bit.
- [laughing] Yes.

07:46.316 --> 07:49.119
- Cora, I'm 'bout to blow
this place up!

07:49.219 --> 07:50.854
- How many likes
do you have, Mr. Brown?

07:51.988 --> 07:54.424
- None.
- Oh. Watch this.

07:55.225 --> 07:56.660
- [laughs]

07:56.760 --> 07:58.562

No, something is wrong.
Something is way wrong.

Did he just give me
a thumbs up?

- Yeah.

11:22.399 --> 11:24.701
I wonder why y'all got
the same hair.

11:26.136 --> 11:29.306
- Mr. Brown. Don't be jealous
'cause you don't have any hair.

11:29.406 --> 11:31.842
- That's 'cause he took it all.

11:31.942 --> 11:34.711
Boy got horse hair.

really want me here.

11:52.420 --> 11:54.689
- Okay, and you're here

11:54.789 --> 11:57.659
- My dad is, um...
- He's what?

11:59.461 --> 12:01.930

12:02.030 --> 12:04.933
- [agreeing]

12:05.033 --> 12:06.534
- What do you mean?

12:06.634 --> 12:10.271
- Um, well, ever since my mom
died, he's just been...

12:10.371 --> 12:12.073
he's kinda watched me
like a hawk.

12:12.173 --> 12:16.478
- Yeah. I'm sorry to hear that.
- Yeah. And--and I'm sorry.

12:16.578 --> 12:18.246

- That I didn't come

12:18.346 --> 12:19.881
and introduce myself to you.

12:19.981 --> 12:22.350
- Yeah, that would've been
the respectful thing to do.

12:22.450 --> 12:24.886
- Yeah, manners.
- I know.

12:24.986 --> 12:28.156
Um, but she said it was fine.
- Oh, did she?

12:28.256 --> 12:32.127
- Yeah. I'm not throwing her
under the bus, am I?

12:32.227 --> 12:34.129
- Bigger than the one you drive.

12:34.229 --> 12:36.598
- Huh. Sorry.

12:36.698 --> 12:39.701
Uh, I like your daughter, a lot.

You know how that is.

12:55.784 --> 12:58.787

13:17.672 --> 13:19.908

- No! No.

13:22.143 --> 13:24.479

13:24.579 --> 13:26.081
Beautiful.
- Alright, okay.

13:26.181 --> 13:29.150
- Don't get me wrong,
your daughter isn't just...cute,

13:29.250 --> 13:31.953
you know, she's sophisticated,
and I really like that.

13:32.053 --> 13:33.488
- Hmm.
- Ah.

13:33.588 --> 13:35.223
It sound like

- Yeah, no problem with her.

13:39.227 --> 13:42.263
Well, how much do you like her?
- VINNY: How much?

13:42.363 --> 13:44.699
- A lot?
- What's a lot?

13:44.799 --> 13:47.635
You mean, like...like a buffet?
- Like a buffet,

13:47.669 --> 13:48.636
like all you can eat.

13:48.670 --> 13:49.871

- Look, look, have a seat.

13:55.310 --> 13:56.711
Have a seat, alright?

13:58.279 --> 14:00.682
Listen. [clears throat]

14:00.782 --> 14:02.717
My daughter, she's really
important to me.

14:02.817 --> 14:04.719
- VINNY: Mm-hmm.
- We just got here.

14:04.819 --> 14:07.756
And I really don't want her
seeing anybody, she's too young.

14:07.856 --> 14:10.759
- Oh. Oka--okay, yes,
I didn't know that.

14:10.859 --> 14:11.993
I could go if you want.

14:12.093 --> 14:13.294
- Alright, man,
have a good night.

14:13.394 --> 14:17.966
- No, no. Give the kid a chance,
man, don't be like that.

14:18.066 --> 14:19.467
- You wanna give somebody
a chance?

14:19.567 --> 14:22.737
- I mean, look, his daddy
is the sheriff,

14:22.837 --> 14:25.306
we need to get the permits,
we need to open this place up

14:25.407 --> 14:28.877
so Brown can get his $40,000,
"Cora, I need my $40,000."

14:31.513 --> 14:34.949
- Alright, look. You know,
you're here already, so, uh,

14:35.049 --> 14:37.152
you know, it's cool,
you can stay.

14:37.252 --> 14:38.753
- Thank you. Thank you.

14:38.853 --> 14:40.955
- But don't get
too comfortable, alright?

14:41.055 --> 14:42.390
- Yes, sir.
- 'Cause he'll bounce

14:42.490 --> 14:43.858
your butt out of here.

14:52.133 --> 14:54.736
- Um...I could, uh, I could
set the table if you want.

14:54.836 --> 14:57.272
- Oh, hell no.

14:57.372 --> 14:58.440
You ain't got no hairnet on,

14:58.540 --> 14:59.641
I don't want your hair
about my food.

14:59.674 --> 15:01.643
- No.
[unintelligible]

15:01.676 --> 15:03.278
- Yeah, yeah, okay, um...

15:05.880 --> 15:08.450
[chuckles] Is there anything
else I can do around here?

15:08.550 --> 15:11.820
- Well, let's see, yeah,
I mean...

15:11.920 --> 15:14.089
- Um, I noticed
your gutters need cleaning,

15:14.189 --> 15:15.457
I'm really good
at cleaning them.

15:15.557 --> 15:18.193
- Oh, no, that--that, uh...
- Oh, no, no, yeah, yeah.

15:18.293 --> 15:19.961
Let's see.
- And, um,

15:20.061 --> 15:22.764
some fresh paint on the overhang
wouldn't hurt, right?

15:22.864 --> 15:24.065
- That's cool,
but you need to know

15:24.165 --> 15:27.435
before you do anything in here,
nobody in this place

15:27.535 --> 15:29.070
can pay you anything.

15:29.170 --> 15:31.773
- Oh, no, no, no,
I don't wanna be paid,

15:31.873 --> 15:34.375
I--I'm fine doing it for free.

15:34.476 --> 15:38.113
- How would you like to marry
my great-granddaughter today?

15:38.213 --> 15:39.481
I can hook that up.
- Grandpa!

15:39.614 --> 15:42.250
- Justice of the peace--your
daddy can marry people.

15:42.350 --> 15:44.185
This boy, he's a keeper.
- O--okay, stop it.

15:44.285 --> 15:46.121
- Okay.
- Don't try to sell my daughter.

15:48.890 --> 15:52.627
Look, Lindor, uh...
give me a minute, alright?

15:52.694 --> 15:53.995
I wanna go talk to my wife,
okay?

15:54.095 --> 15:55.096
- Okay.
- Alright, make yourself

15:55.196 --> 15:56.531
comfortable,
just don't touch the plates.

15:56.631 --> 15:57.799
- Alright.

15:59.634 --> 16:01.636
Sorry. Sorry.

16:01.703 --> 16:04.873
- He don't like to be touched.

16:04.973 --> 16:09.310
- [groaning] Damn.

16:11.479 --> 16:13.548
- What?

16:13.648 --> 16:15.650
- He's actually a nice kid.

16:15.750 --> 16:17.018
- Now, you said the boy
was a...

16:17.118 --> 16:19.821
- I know,
I know what I said, baby.

16:19.921 --> 16:22.357
- And now he's a nice kid.
- Maybe.

16:22.457 --> 16:24.225
He offered to clean
the gutters and everything.

16:24.325 --> 16:27.896
- Yeah, well, maybe he should
marry our daughter then.

16:27.996 --> 16:29.898
Huh? Yeah.
- You know what I mean.

16:29.998 --> 16:33.968
- No, I don't.
- Well. My grandpa, though,

16:34.068 --> 16:35.236
he think he should marry her.

16:35.336 --> 16:37.605
- Well, he'd sell our daughter
for a cow

16:37.705 --> 16:40.775
and two bags of rice.

16:40.875 --> 16:43.378
- And a building permit.

16:43.478 --> 16:45.180
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing, nothing.

16:45.280 --> 16:50.385
You know what? There's something
weird about him, though.

16:50.485 --> 16:51.619
- What you mean, baby?

16:51.686 --> 16:53.788
- I don't know, it's just--
it's just strange,

16:53.888 --> 16:58.827
I can't really explain it.
Like sad, I don't know.

16:58.927 --> 17:03.431
- Hmm, we'll have dinner and...
get to know the boy.

17:06.634 --> 17:09.771
- Yeah, alright.
You doing good?

17:09.871 --> 17:11.339
