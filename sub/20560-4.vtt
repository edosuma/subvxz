[theme music playing]

02:04.874 --> 02:07.544
Fuck. He's dead.

02:07.627 --> 02:09.003
[alarm blaring]

02:11.840 --> 02:14.425
-They're locking the place down.
-This was a set-up.

02:14.509 --> 02:16.803
The police report came way before
she even attacked.

02:16.886 --> 02:18.888
-Two more cars on their way.
-Picture's up.

02:18.972 --> 02:22.058
-Hey, there's Riley.
-Museum surveillance cameras.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.768
Move, move, move!

02:24.686 --> 02:27.147
Move! Move! Move! Move!

02:28.773 --> 02:32.152
Sir! Sir! Sir! Stop it right there! Sir!

02:33.278 --> 02:34.279
Sir, stop!

-[man shouting in foreign language]

02:47.834 --> 02:49.669
Please exit the building!

02:52.422 --> 02:54.090
[shouting in foreign language]

02:54.173 --> 02:55.341
Ready for me?

02:57.135 --> 02:59.679
Please exit the building!

03:01.139 --> 03:06.394
[screaming]

03:06.477 --> 03:09.606
[Riley screaming]

03:09.689 --> 03:11.858
Ma'am, you have to leave the building.

03:11.941 --> 03:12.817
Oh, God!

03:12.901 --> 03:14.861
You have to leave the building.
Calm down.

03:15.445 --> 03:18.197
-Ma'am, what's the problem?
-I saw the terrorist!

03:18.281 --> 03:20.658
-You need to calm down.
-He's attacking the museum! I saw him!

03:20.742 --> 03:23.411
-You need to calm down!
-Don't tell me what to do!

03:24.037 --> 03:28.082
What is the world coming to with this
meaningless destruction of precious art?

03:28.166 --> 03:29.792
Calm down! Calm down!

03:29.876 --> 03:31.836
-What is this world coming to?
-Calm down!

03:31.920 --> 03:34.130
Ma'am, calm down!
Did you see where they went?

03:34.213 --> 03:35.882
That way!

03:35.965 --> 03:39.594
Be careful! Please! Be careful, sir!

03:42.931 --> 03:45.642
[siren wailing in distance]

03:52.649 --> 03:55.235
-[man over radio] Get eyes on back alley.
-[man 2 over radio] Copy that.

03:55.318 --> 03:57.278
[siren wailing]

04:00.782 --> 04:02.325
[Capheus] We should get out of the city.

04:02.408 --> 04:05.912
-Do not go back to the same place.
-I have another safe house ready.

04:05.995 --> 04:08.373
-If these work...
-Whispers won't be able to find us.

04:09.082 --> 04:13.253
-[Kala] But we don't know what they are.
-Croome could have been lying.

04:13.336 --> 04:14.837
We should run some basic tests.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.798
My friend who's been supplying drugs
has a lab.

04:16.881 --> 04:17.715
Good. Let's do it.

04:17.799 --> 04:19.884
What I don't understand
is if that was Whispers--

04:19.968 --> 04:22.428
-It was him.
-I thought Croome took Whispers out.

04:22.512 --> 04:25.848
-He was either lying...
-Or someone else brought Whispers back in.

04:25.932 --> 04:28.059
Croome could've been telling the truth
about enemies inside BPO.

04:28.142 --> 04:29.477
Meaning we lost an ally.

04:29.560 --> 04:31.729
But that also means
he can't be the only one.

04:33.356 --> 04:34.565
Wolfgang.

04:35.775 --> 04:37.235
Sorry I wasn't there.

04:38.444 --> 04:41.030
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

04:41.614 --> 04:47.495
I met someone who I think can help us.
Her name's Lila and... she's like us.

04:49.163 --> 04:51.165
There are more clusters. I knew it!

04:51.291 --> 04:53.042
The way he was talking about her,

04:53.126 --> 04:55.295
she felt like she'd been around
for a while.

04:55.378 --> 04:56.254
Which means...

04:56.337 --> 04:58.631
Her cluster has been able
to stay free from BPO.

04:58.715 --> 05:00.800
Unless they're working for them.

05:00.883 --> 05:02.427
Like Whispers.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.806
-Wolfgang, you need to be careful.
-I'll be fine.

05:06.889 --> 05:09.809
But give me what you can find
on Lila Facchini.

05:10.184 --> 05:11.853
Lila Facchini. Got it.

05:13.938 --> 05:16.482
Uh... [clears throat]

05:19.027 --> 05:22.697
I know you got some kind of really
complicated problem here.

05:22.780 --> 05:24.949
And while some people
might get a bit freaked out

05:25.033 --> 05:29.037
with you talking to empty space
all the time, you know,

05:29.120 --> 05:30.913
I'm totally cool with shit like that.

05:31.706 --> 05:32.915
And I just...

05:34.417 --> 05:37.211
You know you can trust me, right?

05:40.757 --> 05:41.966
Don't look at me.

05:53.728 --> 05:57.190
-[soft music plays]
-[woman singing]

06:12.663 --> 06:13.915
[Rajan] Hmm.

06:15.249 --> 06:16.084
Interesting.

06:16.667 --> 06:18.044
That's a nice piece.

06:22.757 --> 06:23.800
Thanks.

06:27.011 --> 06:28.429
Crush your enemies!

06:29.639 --> 06:31.390
[chuckles]

06:42.902 --> 06:45.446
That's, uh, Sanjay, the C&amp;I minister.

06:45.530 --> 06:47.865
-I'll go say hello. Be right back.
-Okay.

06:47.949 --> 06:49.492
-You okay?
-Yeah, fine.

07:15.184 --> 07:16.269
Hey, check this out.

07:40.334 --> 07:41.752
You like it?

07:43.296 --> 07:46.215
I don't think I really understand it.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.259
Maybe that's why I like it.

07:48.342 --> 07:51.888
Art needs a bit of mystery. Something...

07:52.472 --> 07:54.390
something that resists us.

08:05.359 --> 08:08.446
-I'm Ajay.
-Oh, yes. Hello.

08:08.529 --> 08:11.365
See? Works every time.

08:12.116 --> 08:15.244
I never understood how obvious it was.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.370
[Rajan] There you are!

08:16.454 --> 08:17.413
[chuckles]

08:17.497 --> 08:18.998
You met my beautiful bride?

08:19.081 --> 08:20.917
Yes, and for once you haven't exaggerated.

08:22.043 --> 08:24.170
When you're on that side
of the velvet rope,

08:24.253 --> 08:26.380
all you want is to be on this side.

08:28.257 --> 08:29.967
Gotta piss. [clears throat]

08:30.051 --> 08:33.513
I should've been at your wedding,
but business in Seoul prevented me.

08:33.596 --> 08:37.141
Of course. But speaking of business,
I see you invited Sanjay here.

08:38.267 --> 08:39.936
The secret to a rich life, Raj,

08:40.019 --> 08:43.022
is dissolving the boundary
between business and pleasure.

08:43.105 --> 08:45.983
[laughs]

08:46.067 --> 08:48.694
-Um, if you will please excuse me.
-Sure.

08:48.778 --> 08:51.405
[music continues]

09:26.399 --> 09:27.733
Hi!

09:27.817 --> 09:28.943
Hi.

09:31.988 --> 09:33.698
Why bathrooms?

09:52.466 --> 09:53.843
How are you?

09:56.012 --> 09:57.847
Fine. You?

09:58.848 --> 10:00.850
I got a new job.

10:01.475 --> 10:03.019
I got a promotion.

10:04.895 --> 10:07.607
Being the wife of the owner
has its perks, I guess.

10:07.690 --> 10:10.234
Rajan respects the work I do.

10:10.776 --> 10:13.613
He believes women should be
in high positions of power.

10:14.447 --> 10:15.740
Hm...

10:17.950 --> 10:19.619
Well, I gotta piss.

10:20.536 --> 10:21.662
Wolfgang.

10:24.790 --> 10:26.417
Why is it like this?

10:27.293 --> 10:29.253
Why is it so hard?

10:31.797 --> 10:34.050
Why can't it be like that day
when I was in the temple

10:34.133 --> 10:36.135
and in the cafe in the rain?

10:39.639 --> 10:41.849
Why is it that I can't talk
to the only person...

10:42.808 --> 10:45.311
I ever felt I could say anything to?

10:48.856 --> 10:53.110
Because... you deserve to be happy.

10:57.031 --> 10:57.990
Wolfgang...

11:00.701 --> 11:01.869
Hello, sexy.

11:03.746 --> 11:05.164
[Kala] Wolfgang?

11:08.167 --> 11:09.669
What if I don't want to be happy?

11:10.419 --> 11:12.088
Is someone with you?

11:12.171 --> 11:13.714
What if I want something else?

11:13.798 --> 11:16.509
Whoever she is, you really want her,
don't you?

11:16.592 --> 11:18.511
I know I shouldn't say this...

11:19.887 --> 11:22.181
I know it isn't right to even think it,
but...

11:22.264 --> 11:23.641
This could be fun.

11:24.392 --> 11:27.520
...what if I'm only pretending
to be a good person?

11:31.690 --> 11:33.651
And deep down I'm just...

11:34.819 --> 11:36.445
[door opens]

11:36.529 --> 11:37.655
Ah...

11:38.906 --> 11:42.827
-This is where you've been hiding, huh?
-No, I, you know, was just...

11:42.910 --> 11:43.744
Um...

11:43.828 --> 11:47.456
So tell us, what do you think of that
wicked man, Ajay Kapoor?

11:51.961 --> 11:53.045
Is she gone?

11:54.255 --> 11:55.548
Pity.

11:58.759 --> 12:00.219
What are you doing here?

12:01.637 --> 12:02.638
Hanging out.

12:04.765 --> 12:05.891
Bored.

12:07.726 --> 12:09.270
Who are you waiting for?

12:09.895 --> 12:13.774
And here everything was going
so perfectly superficial.

12:13.858 --> 12:16.861
I'm just trying to understand why someone
like you is working for Fuchs.

12:16.944 --> 12:18.571
He's like any sapien.

12:19.238 --> 12:21.907
A temporary solution
to a long-term problem.

12:22.950 --> 12:24.076
BPO.

12:26.412 --> 12:29.123
-How do you avoid them?
-You don't.

12:29.707 --> 12:31.208
But they're not hunting you.

12:31.834 --> 12:33.836
-No.
-You made some kind of deal with them.

12:33.919 --> 12:35.379
Smart boy.

12:35.463 --> 12:36.630
How's it work?

12:36.714 --> 12:39.216
Same as everything else in the world.

12:40.092 --> 12:44.180
Figure out what you want and decide
how far you're willing to go to get it.

12:46.682 --> 12:48.058
What do you want?

12:50.978 --> 12:52.480
Everything.

12:58.277 --> 12:59.987
[engine starts]

13:00.070 --> 13:01.780
Gotta run, lover boy.

13:13.667 --> 13:15.377
[exhales]

13:21.634 --> 13:24.136
Whoa!

13:27.181 --> 13:28.349
Wow.

13:29.266 --> 13:35.189
Wait, so... like, your brain is,
like, part of a bigger brain

13:35.272 --> 13:38.400
and it's all networked
and file-sharing and...

13:38.484 --> 13:42.613
Holy shit, Nom.

13:42.696 --> 13:46.450
I thought this trans
new-body-now-a-hottie thing was cool,

13:46.534 --> 13:47.368
but this?

13:47.451 --> 13:51.914
This... [whispering]
other-secret-species thing...

13:52.456 --> 13:53.832
Shit.

13:54.458 --> 13:57.545
That's, like, the coolest thing
I ever heard.

13:57.628 --> 13:58.796
Okay...

14:00.756 --> 14:04.134
but, please, don't talk about it.

14:09.306 --> 14:11.141
This is serious, Bug.

14:11.225 --> 14:13.644
Of course it's serious.

14:13.727 --> 14:16.480
This is capital letters B-I-G.

14:16.564 --> 14:19.108
As in Galileo.

14:19.191 --> 14:22.862
Time to rethink geocentrism.

14:26.282 --> 14:27.575
[exhales]

14:29.702 --> 14:32.079
I don't think I'm gonna sleep
for a week.

14:35.124 --> 14:36.792
[Nomi sighs]

14:37.209 --> 14:39.128
[clattering on stairs]

14:44.383 --> 14:45.801
Was that a mistake?

14:59.481 --> 15:02.067
[Min-Jung sighs] Same idea.

15:04.278 --> 15:05.738
I couldn't sleep.

15:07.114 --> 15:11.660
I haven't felt this awake
in a very long time.

15:14.079 --> 15:15.080
Good.

15:25.966 --> 15:28.844
It is not every day you escape prison.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.721
[Min-Jung chuckles]

15:34.767 --> 15:36.352
Thank you again.

15:37.937 --> 15:40.773
I wouldn't be alive
if you hadn't helped me.

15:44.026 --> 15:48.489
Those men who attacked you,
they were hired by your brother?

15:52.159 --> 15:53.285
Good.

15:56.747 --> 15:58.290
Why good?

15:58.374 --> 15:59.583
Because...

16:00.876 --> 16:05.047
he must be very afraid of you
to do something like that.

16:06.006 --> 16:11.929
I'm sure when he hears you have escaped,
he's going to piss himself.

16:12.012 --> 16:13.305
[soft chuckle]

16:23.440 --> 16:26.986
I have met strong women before.

16:28.112 --> 16:32.449
But... none of them were like you.

16:33.117 --> 16:38.789
Soo-Jin said you have a heart
as soft as a baby bird.

16:41.875 --> 16:47.256
It was what made me like you
the moment we met.

16:53.095 --> 16:58.809
Part of me wants you to find your brother
and make him pay for what he has done.

17:00.519 --> 17:05.482
I know that part of me
would enjoy your revenge.

17:10.195 --> 17:12.072
Whatever you do, child...

17:13.699 --> 17:19.204
do not let it be at the cost
of your beautiful heart.

17:31.425 --> 17:34.553
[man] This kind of polyphony requires
an abandonment of self

17:34.636 --> 17:38.140
so that I can release the boundary
or loosen the boundaries of that self

17:38.223 --> 17:42.895
while writing so I can become someone else
temporarily, imaginatively.

17:42.978 --> 17:45.564
[man 2] We just listen to so many voices

17:45.647 --> 17:48.400
where we're exposed to so many more
different people

17:48.484 --> 17:49.568
than even our parents were.

17:49.651 --> 17:53.739
We get more images in a single week

17:53.822 --> 17:58.118
than people a hundred years ago
would've seen possibly in their lifetimes.

18:02.456 --> 18:05.167
[crowd shouting]

18:22.434 --> 18:25.979
Well, well, well. Let me guess.

18:26.063 --> 18:28.232
You're here to interview the real deal.

18:29.066 --> 18:31.110
You know, as a journalist,

18:31.193 --> 18:35.864
you probably can sense that that guy
in there is just a pretty boy I hired.

18:35.948 --> 18:37.950
-Yeah, I had a feeling.
-You had a feeling.

18:38.909 --> 18:40.786
Ah! Yeah.

18:42.079 --> 18:44.581
-Hello.
-Hi.

18:44.665 --> 18:47.376
-The nature of the textual intercourse...
-Ah. There you go.

18:47.459 --> 18:48.710
-...is, uh...
-[laughter]

18:48.794 --> 18:51.213
God, I just want to eat them up.

18:51.296 --> 18:54.508
I can't believe I'm not there.
This is so stupid.

18:54.591 --> 18:56.885
Two of our favorite writers
and I'm stuck on a boat.

18:56.969 --> 18:58.220
What are you doing here?

18:59.221 --> 19:04.893
Well, the video of our recording
has already hit over a million views.

19:04.977 --> 19:07.688
-[laughs]
-[laughs]

19:07.771 --> 19:10.357
The TV station has never
seen anything like it.

19:11.024 --> 19:15.070
So, my boss, Kobi Kihara, was wondering
if we could do a follow-up story on you.

19:16.280 --> 19:19.825
-Do you believe in happy endings?
-[laughter]

19:19.908 --> 19:21.952
What? I couldn't hear.

19:22.035 --> 19:24.705
Someone asked if they believe
in happy endings.

19:24.788 --> 19:26.665
-[laughter]
-[man] Miraculously, yes.

19:27.457 --> 19:29.334
-Uh-oh. I gotta go.
-Wait!

19:29.418 --> 19:31.503
-Gotta help behind the counter.
-No. Did they--

19:31.587 --> 19:33.547
-Love you.
-[sighs]

19:34.798 --> 19:36.842
Do I believe in happy endings anymore?

19:45.100 --> 19:46.560
-[grunting]
-[screams]

19:46.643 --> 19:47.686
Help!

19:50.772 --> 19:53.192
Is this the first time
you're coming back since?

19:55.068 --> 19:57.696
Me, too. Come on.

20:02.242 --> 20:05.078
[crowd chanting]
Van Damn! Van Damn! Van Damn!

20:10.667 --> 20:13.337
[shouting indistinctly]

20:16.965 --> 20:19.426
[speaking foreign language]

20:19.509 --> 20:21.220
[beeping]

20:23.972 --> 20:25.140
This is all new.

20:26.308 --> 20:27.809
Yes.

20:27.893 --> 20:30.479
[crowd shouting]

20:36.610 --> 20:38.487
[chanting] Van Damn!

20:45.535 --> 20:48.830
Ever since Mr. Rasal's Anti-Idolatry bill
was passed,

20:48.914 --> 20:51.375
there's been a lot of trouble
in the temple, ma'am.

20:51.458 --> 20:53.377
It got worse when Guru Yash was arrested.

20:53.460 --> 20:56.713
Manendra believed that's necessary
for the long-term good.

20:58.632 --> 21:00.342
[crowd chanting, shouting]

21:00.425 --> 21:02.052
-[speaking foreign language]
-On Van Damn.

21:02.135 --> 21:04.805
-Ken. What's going on?
-The bastard raised the prices again.

21:04.888 --> 21:07.599
Most of my people can't afford it anymore.

21:08.183 --> 21:11.436
This is terrible.
We all come here for the same reason.

21:11.520 --> 21:13.563
I don't think that's true.

21:19.027 --> 21:22.281
We obey no law but his law!

21:22.364 --> 21:24.408
[crowd shouting]

21:25.284 --> 21:29.955
You are either with us or against us!

21:30.998 --> 21:32.708
There is no middle ground!

21:32.791 --> 21:37.045
If we do not stop them,
they will close our temples!

21:37.796 --> 21:40.173
And destroy our country!

21:40.257 --> 21:42.801
[crowd chanting]

21:45.345 --> 21:48.348
[man shouting]

21:48.932 --> 21:52.352
Hey! You can have it when you pay for it!

21:52.436 --> 21:53.395
[inaudible]

21:54.688 --> 21:56.398
[man shouts]

21:57.899 --> 22:00.694
Oh, the famous Van Damn.

22:00.777 --> 22:03.989
These people need water. Water is life.

22:04.072 --> 22:08.035
Water is a commodity.
And every commodity has a price.

22:08.744 --> 22:10.704
-One truth!
-One truth!

22:10.787 --> 22:12.789
-Our truth!
-Our truth!

22:12.873 --> 22:17.419
[all chanting] One truth! Our truth!

22:21.590 --> 22:23.467
I mean, the idea of polyphonic fiction

22:23.550 --> 22:26.720
reflecting both the intercontextuality
of an author's work and their life

22:26.803 --> 22:28.889
really resonated
with what is happening to you.

22:28.972 --> 22:30.348
You mean to us.

22:30.432 --> 22:34.102
It is impacting us both,
but how it does is different.

22:36.354 --> 22:37.481
Oh, shit.

22:37.564 --> 22:40.525
-What?
-I think he's back.

22:40.609 --> 22:42.277
-Bendix?
-Uh-huh.

22:42.903 --> 22:45.447
Probably figured out I'm not
at the Women's Shelter anymore.

22:46.073 --> 22:48.492
-I don't want to lead him to the boat.
-What are you gonna do?

22:51.745 --> 22:52.954
Lose him.

23:02.047 --> 23:04.633
[crowd shouting]

23:08.845 --> 23:15.060
[crowd chanting] One truth! Our truth!

23:15.811 --> 23:16.978
Neets!

23:21.900 --> 23:25.654
-I know you! I know you!
-You're not one of us!

23:25.737 --> 23:27.906
No, we should get out of here.

23:27.989 --> 23:29.282
The devil!

23:29.950 --> 23:31.827
She's the devil!

23:31.910 --> 23:33.328
[all shouting]

23:33.411 --> 23:35.997
[soft rock plays]

23:46.007 --> 23:47.050
[inaudible dialogue]

23:54.099 --> 23:55.851
[inaudible dialogue]

24:04.818 --> 24:07.821
[crowd chanting]

24:22.961 --> 24:25.839
[inaudible dialogue]

25:09.090 --> 25:10.467
[inaudible dialogue]

25:40.288 --> 25:43.833
[crowd shouting]

25:53.510 --> 25:56.179
[shouting]

26:12.445 --> 26:15.115
[Amanita] ...toilet paper gets stuck
to your fucking shoe.

26:15.198 --> 26:18.076
You step on it with the other foot
and then it sticks to your other foot

26:18.159 --> 26:20.412
and then it takes for-fucking-ever
to get rid of it.

26:20.495 --> 26:23.707
-Where are you?
-Oh!

26:23.790 --> 26:26.876
[gasping, panting]

26:28.128 --> 26:29.170
I'm sorry.

26:30.088 --> 26:31.715
Oh!

26:35.176 --> 26:36.594
Did something else happen?

26:37.762 --> 26:39.556
Something's always happening.

26:39.639 --> 26:41.975
Something happened to the cluster?

26:42.058 --> 26:46.438
There was a protest in India,
a riot over water in Nairobi.

26:47.522 --> 26:50.233
But mostly I was just worried about you.

26:50.317 --> 26:56.114
Oh! God. You are having a major bad day.

26:59.993 --> 27:05.540
I don't want to complain
because Bug is our total hero...

27:06.374 --> 27:09.461
but I think I'm going a little crazy
on this boat.

27:10.045 --> 27:12.714
I know. Me, too.

27:17.635 --> 27:19.429
Oh! [laughs]

27:22.807 --> 27:25.518
Money. Power. Property.

27:25.602 --> 27:30.065
Those are the real drugs.
They suck out every drop of humanity.

27:30.148 --> 27:33.818
Speaking of dehumanizing drugs,
this is my friend Puck.

27:33.902 --> 27:37.238
He's one of the best chemical engineers
I've ever met.

27:39.866 --> 27:42.369
No, we haven't met.
I am a big fan, though.

27:42.452 --> 27:45.663
I've listened to your set
at the Berghain many times.

27:45.747 --> 27:46.915
Thank you.

27:46.998 --> 27:51.795
He's never stayed more than a day or two
with me, but this...

27:53.505 --> 27:56.883
this little mystery
seems to have caught his attention.

27:56.966 --> 27:59.052
That is a pretty piece of chaining.

27:59.719 --> 28:01.221
Effective ligand.

28:01.304 --> 28:02.931
Can I ask where you got it?

28:04.349 --> 28:06.643
I'm sorry, but I can't tell you.

28:06.726 --> 28:10.939
Um, did you find anything trackable
or toxic in it?

28:11.564 --> 28:15.026
Well, that depends on your definition
of toxic. It's an androgen booster.

28:16.027 --> 28:18.363
Which would inhibit the entactogens.

28:19.239 --> 28:20.281
Exactly.

28:20.365 --> 28:22.700
It's the opposite of something like DMT.

28:22.784 --> 28:26.538
Blocking empathic synaptic connection,
rather than exciting it.

28:27.247 --> 28:29.749
-And bonding...
-...the inhibitor to the neural proteins.

28:29.833 --> 28:31.251
Impressive.

28:31.876 --> 28:34.879
Are they teaching bio-chem
at DJ school now?

28:34.963 --> 28:39.008
Uh, do you think you could run some
basic reactivity tests to my blood?

28:39.092 --> 28:41.553
Yeah, let me get a syringe.

28:59.279 --> 29:00.572
I've missed you.

29:01.781 --> 29:03.450
It's good to catch up.

29:05.660 --> 29:07.162
So who is this guy?

29:07.787 --> 29:10.457
No. Maybe just an old friend.

29:12.125 --> 29:13.793
I really appreciate your help.

29:13.877 --> 29:15.795
She said he was an artist.

29:16.421 --> 29:17.839
Nice lab for an artist.

29:21.509 --> 29:22.385
Hey...

29:23.470 --> 29:24.763
I think maybe he was a lover.

29:26.181 --> 29:30.101
I wasn't going to say anything,
but I know a little about what's going on.

29:32.645 --> 29:34.439
I know you're in some kind of trouble.

29:35.690 --> 29:36.983
Can I help?

29:38.693 --> 29:40.320
No, I don't think so.

29:40.945 --> 29:44.783
-Do we really think we can trust this guy?
-He could've called the police by now.

29:45.492 --> 29:46.951
I don't really like him.

29:48.077 --> 29:51.539
I think he's kind of sexy. But...

29:51.623 --> 29:54.709
Can I ask you, are you in town
to do a show here in Amsterdam?

29:54.793 --> 29:56.753
-Yes, she is.
-[both] What?

29:56.836 --> 29:58.588
Or at least I'm hoping she is.

29:59.798 --> 30:02.717
You know, Vincent mentioned
that you had a few legal issues.

30:02.801 --> 30:04.302
Uh, nothing serious.

30:04.385 --> 30:07.013
Your show could be posted
or Periscoped last minute.

30:07.096 --> 30:09.599
-Periscoped? What?
-Instant invite.

30:09.682 --> 30:11.559
No. That's not happening.

30:11.643 --> 30:14.521
I have friends who could make sure
you're kept safe.

30:14.604 --> 30:16.231
It's far too dangerous.

30:16.314 --> 30:18.149
No, I don't think it's possible.

30:19.317 --> 30:20.985
Well, you better watch out for this guy

30:21.069 --> 30:22.987
'cause he will talk you into
and out of anything.

30:23.863 --> 30:26.533
Puck prefers to live differently than me.

30:27.116 --> 30:29.661
"King of the ostriches.

30:29.744 --> 30:35.124
I've lived so long with my head buried,
I should be able to breathe sand by now."

30:35.208 --> 30:36.501
I know that line.

30:36.584 --> 30:39.546
It's from The Price of Life is Death.

30:39.629 --> 30:42.298
-Yes.
-Puck loves cheesy movies.

30:44.509 --> 30:45.677
Cheesy?

30:47.637 --> 30:48.930
I don't like him either.

30:50.348 --> 30:51.683
You were right.

30:51.766 --> 30:54.519
Three, two, one.

30:54.602 --> 30:58.147
Hey, guys, we're so glad you could join us
on this beautiful day.

30:58.231 --> 31:00.233
We have a very special guest indeed.

31:00.316 --> 31:04.654
His name is Capheus Onyango,
though he is better known as Van Damn,

31:04.737 --> 31:08.992
after the matatu which he drives.
Do we have a picture?

31:10.034 --> 31:11.870
Looking good. Van Damn.

31:11.953 --> 31:15.039
So, first of all, Capheus,
welcome to the show.

31:15.123 --> 31:19.168
Thank you, Miss Kihara.
It is a very big honor for me to be here.

31:19.252 --> 31:21.629
Very kind of you to say,
and "Kobi" is just fine.

31:21.713 --> 31:23.631
We don't stand on ceremony here.

31:23.715 --> 31:27.260
Now when we started researching
this story, we asked ourselves,

31:27.343 --> 31:29.220
"Who was this matatu driver?

31:29.304 --> 31:33.600
Where did this guy come from who commands
so much respect from his community?"

31:33.683 --> 31:37.061
I was born in a small village
outside Nakuru.

31:37.145 --> 31:41.524
I understand that grassroots activism
actually runs in your family?

31:41.608 --> 31:45.278
Your father was involved in setting up
a tea planters union in the 1990s?

31:45.361 --> 31:46.487
That's true.

31:46.571 --> 31:49.866
I was only a young boy,
so I don't remember very much.

31:49.949 --> 31:52.827
Those familiar with the story
of those terrible strikes

31:52.911 --> 31:56.205
will understand the tragedy
of what happened to your father.

31:57.206 --> 32:01.544
Yeah. My father was killed during one
of the riots.

32:02.128 --> 32:04.672
-I'm sorry, Capheus.
-Thank you.

32:05.340 --> 32:08.051
Would you say that this tragic incident

32:08.134 --> 32:11.471
is what powers your desire
for social justice?

32:11.554 --> 32:15.642
To be truthful, the thought
has never occurred to me until now.

32:16.225 --> 32:17.268
Maybe so.

32:17.852 --> 32:20.355
But surely the desire for justice
lives in all of us.

32:20.438 --> 32:24.734
Few of us are willing to risk it
just as you did last week.

32:24.817 --> 32:29.697
One of our reporters was in your matatu
and captured this extraordinary event.

32:29.781 --> 32:31.282
Can we roll the tape?

32:32.200 --> 32:35.453
-[crowd chanting] Van Damn! Van Damn!
-Unbelievable.

32:37.622 --> 32:38.790
Wow.

32:39.332 --> 32:42.502
This very brave young man
diffused an angry incident

32:42.585 --> 32:44.379
that threatened to get much worse.

32:44.462 --> 32:47.298
Kibera has been a deprived neighborhood
for forever.

32:47.382 --> 32:50.051
Why has this anger
reached fever pitch now?

32:50.802 --> 32:51.761
Water.

32:53.304 --> 32:55.598
Think what we all need water for.

32:57.100 --> 32:59.018
We cannot live without water.

33:01.437 --> 33:05.858
What do you pay for a liter of water
that is packed to your home, Miss Kobi?

33:05.942 --> 33:07.026
Hm?

33:07.110 --> 33:10.655
We both know that it is much less
than what people in Kibera pay.

33:12.532 --> 33:15.994
Kibera has been represented
at the National Assembly by Mr. Mandiba

33:16.077 --> 33:17.996
for the last three terms.

33:18.079 --> 33:19.956
Do you think the problem
is a political one?

33:20.039 --> 33:24.585
Look, who am I to answer such a question?

33:25.795 --> 33:27.213
I drive a bus.

33:28.297 --> 33:31.092
If I didn't take people
where they hired me to take them...

33:31.884 --> 33:34.137
I wouldn't expect them
to get back on my bus.

33:35.138 --> 33:38.349
We expect leaders to take us
where we want to go.

33:38.433 --> 33:41.936
The problem, it seems to me,
begins when they don't.

33:42.770 --> 33:44.814
When things do not improve
and yet these leaders

33:44.897 --> 33:47.191
keep expecting us to get on their bus...

33:49.235 --> 33:52.113
I think this is when leaders
become something else.

33:52.196 --> 33:53.239
What?

33:54.824 --> 33:55.908
Politicians.

34:03.541 --> 34:06.377
-It's a beautiful day, Mrs. Rasal.
-It is, Mr. Bhoopalam.

34:06.461 --> 34:07.378
Mrs. Rasal.

34:08.421 --> 34:10.214
Hello. Who are you?

34:10.757 --> 34:13.092
-Who is this?
-New security.

34:13.718 --> 34:14.886
Vikram, ma'am.

34:15.595 --> 34:17.972
I'm in charge of keeping your family safe.

34:18.056 --> 34:20.475
The elevator is waiting. This way.

34:23.770 --> 34:25.563
-Six months--
-Rajan?

34:26.314 --> 34:27.315
Rajan?

34:27.398 --> 34:31.444
Why is there a security man
with a machine gun following me?

34:31.527 --> 34:33.654
I tried to call you,
but your phone has been switched off.

34:33.738 --> 34:35.990
-Mr. Singh.
-Namaste, Mrs. Rasal.

34:36.074 --> 34:39.327
I'm Agent Singh
from the National Intelligence Bureau.

34:40.078 --> 34:43.081
Over the past week or two,
we've received several death threats

34:43.164 --> 34:46.667
aimed at your father-in-law,
his company and family.

34:48.795 --> 34:50.630
I didn't want to concern you unduly,
darling.

34:51.839 --> 34:55.426
This morning we intercepted an explosive
device addressed to your husband.

34:55.510 --> 34:57.386
Oh, my God! What?

34:57.470 --> 35:00.098
The police laughed at it
because it was so poorly made.

35:00.181 --> 35:04.393
Nevertheless, the government has insisted
to provide your father-in-law's family

35:04.477 --> 35:06.062
round-the-clock security.

35:06.145 --> 35:07.396
For how long?

35:08.147 --> 35:12.276
Until such time as god-intoxicated maniacs
are not plotting to kill us, Kala.

35:13.027 --> 35:15.238
It's for your own protection, ma'am.

35:15.988 --> 35:20.660
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
Thank you. Excuse me.

35:53.359 --> 35:56.195
-You said you live with your parents?
-Relax.

35:58.364 --> 36:00.241
No one's going to walk in on us.

36:08.457 --> 36:10.168
Why did you call me?

36:12.587 --> 36:14.672
Let me try and answer that question
for you.

36:19.760 --> 36:22.054
There are people you meet in your life...

36:22.763 --> 36:26.851
and... for no logical reason,

36:26.934 --> 36:29.687
you feel immediately connected to.

36:32.064 --> 36:36.736
But in fact, there's actually
a scientific explanation.

36:37.320 --> 36:38.446
I know.

36:40.448 --> 36:42.533
I just couldn't help myself.

36:44.994 --> 36:46.329
You talking to me?

36:54.837 --> 36:56.130
Señor?

36:57.173 --> 36:58.382
Señor Pasquale?

36:59.592 --> 37:01.844
My name is Lito Rodriguez.

37:01.928 --> 37:02.970
I'm an actor.

37:03.763 --> 37:05.139
So?

37:05.223 --> 37:07.350
I knew your son, Raoul.

37:08.559 --> 37:10.645
He interviewed me years ago.

37:11.979 --> 37:13.022
Yes.

37:15.942 --> 37:16.901
I know your face.

37:19.320 --> 37:21.864
Raoul found your movies...

37:22.365 --> 37:23.366
Cheesy?

37:23.449 --> 37:26.661
No. You underestimate yourself.

37:27.495 --> 37:29.372
Come, come. Please.

37:41.217 --> 37:43.052
Raoul was always different.

37:44.303 --> 37:45.846
Even when he was very young.

37:48.933 --> 37:51.352
We were a family of journalists...

37:51.936 --> 37:54.272
my wife, Raoul, me.

37:54.355 --> 37:55.564
Thank you.

37:56.816 --> 38:01.070
The truth was not a thing to be hidden
or denied.

38:01.153 --> 38:02.905
Not under our roof.

38:02.989 --> 38:07.243
But to hunt for truth,
you need a sixth sense for it.

38:07.868 --> 38:09.328
Journalistic intuition.

38:11.038 --> 38:17.128
In my 40 years, I never knew anyone
with an intuition like my son.

38:24.719 --> 38:26.137
You and Raoul were lovers?

38:28.264 --> 38:29.682
Well, um...

38:29.765 --> 38:33.144
[moaning]

38:33.227 --> 38:34.437
Wait, I...

38:35.062 --> 38:38.691
I want to let you know that I'm...
I'm not gay. Okay?

38:38.774 --> 38:41.986
I... I'm...

38:44.655 --> 38:45.740
Wait, wait.

38:45.823 --> 38:47.366
I just think that...

38:48.367 --> 38:53.581
as an actor, it is important to be open
to all kinds of experiences.

38:53.664 --> 38:54.874
Sure.

38:58.002 --> 38:59.503
[stammers] It was just...

39:09.597 --> 39:10.765
[sighs]

39:10.848 --> 39:12.391
Yes.

39:12.475 --> 39:15.770
-Hm.
-Journalistic intuition?

39:16.979 --> 39:22.193
Well, let's just say...
you are my son's type.

39:25.780 --> 39:27.239
Um...

39:29.992 --> 39:31.786
Señor Pasquale...

39:31.869 --> 39:33.913
Can I ask about his disappearance?

39:36.123 --> 39:38.417
I know he went to Chicago for a story.

39:39.168 --> 39:40.669
Do you know anything about it?

39:42.421 --> 39:46.008
He said it was the biggest story
of his career.

39:48.427 --> 39:50.846
Perhaps the biggest story of the decade.

39:55.768 --> 39:57.937
Come on, Mrs. Cho, it's the police.

39:59.105 --> 40:00.481
-[knocking on door]
-Sh!

40:10.282 --> 40:13.244
[knocking on door]

40:19.542 --> 40:20.751
Come on, Mrs. Cho.

40:21.961 --> 40:24.588
It's too early in the morning
to kick the door in, isn't it?

40:27.091 --> 40:28.300
My son's room.

40:32.221 --> 40:33.764
It hasn't changed much.

40:35.516 --> 40:40.479
Homes are architectural forms of memory.

40:43.983 --> 40:48.612
Since he disappeared,
I haven't been able to come in here.

40:54.827 --> 40:56.745
These are his photographs.

41:04.462 --> 41:05.838
[Nomi] That's the cabin.

41:06.797 --> 41:09.300
We need to know where these pictures
were taken.

41:09.800 --> 41:11.969
Do you know where these pictures
were taken?

41:12.052 --> 41:14.889
Um... somewhere in California.

41:14.972 --> 41:19.643
The woman in the picture
was important to the story. And to him.

41:19.727 --> 41:22.480
Can you take pictures of all of this stuff
and send it to me?

41:22.563 --> 41:24.857
Do you mind if I take pictures?

41:29.987 --> 41:31.447
Do you know her?

41:31.530 --> 41:33.491
Her name is Angelica.

41:38.120 --> 41:42.625
When my son was disappeared, the police
said he was involved with drugs.

41:42.708 --> 41:44.460
Hm. I knew they were lying.

41:44.543 --> 41:47.296
When they came here,
they were looking for something.

41:47.379 --> 41:48.923
They did not find it.

41:52.259 --> 41:53.302
You see?

41:55.095 --> 41:58.182
My son believed his secrets
would be safe with you.

41:59.016 --> 41:59.892
And they were.

42:03.812 --> 42:06.190
[knock on door]

42:06.273 --> 42:07.566
Well, hello.

42:07.650 --> 42:09.443
Oh, hi. Yeah.

42:09.527 --> 42:14.740
Uh, Detective Mun,
from Seoul Metropolitan Police.

42:14.823 --> 42:17.326
A real detective? Oh!

42:17.409 --> 42:19.078
Here? Heavens.

42:19.161 --> 42:21.205
We just have some questions.

42:23.332 --> 42:25.376
Oh, my, my!

42:25.459 --> 42:27.503
What's all this about?

42:27.586 --> 42:30.965
Actually, one of your neighbors
found these prison uniforms

42:31.048 --> 42:34.468
-in your garbage bag this morning.
-Oh...

42:35.052 --> 42:36.720
Familiar, are they?

42:36.804 --> 42:40.307
Yeah, of course they are.
They used to be mine.

42:41.767 --> 42:44.353
The uniforms have numbers, Mrs. Cho.

42:44.436 --> 42:47.731
So you can just drop
the innocent old lady act.

42:47.815 --> 42:50.484
I know you won't mind us
searching your apartment.

42:50.568 --> 42:53.904
I know you won't mind
showing me your warrant.

42:55.739 --> 42:59.326
One of the escaped convicts
was a Min-Jung.

42:59.410 --> 43:02.162
You and she were cellmates, weren't you?

43:02.246 --> 43:05.499
The only thing I hate more
than rhetorical questions...

43:06.375 --> 43:09.086
stupid rhetorical questions.

43:09.169 --> 43:14.466
Harboring fugitives, Mrs. Cho...
that's a serious crime.

43:16.385 --> 43:18.596
I don't want to have to put you
back in prison.

43:22.266 --> 43:25.227
Yeah. They were here.

43:25.311 --> 43:27.021
Okay.

43:27.104 --> 43:28.939
But they left last night.

43:31.275 --> 43:34.570
You can search the place
if you don't believe me.

43:45.372 --> 43:47.041
[Lito] You're a reporter.

43:47.124 --> 43:48.792
You must have watched this.

43:49.543 --> 43:51.086
[Pasquale] Of course.

43:51.170 --> 43:53.964
But I don't understand what it means.

43:54.048 --> 43:55.924
Maybe you can explain it to me.

43:58.886 --> 44:00.512
That's Todd.

44:02.806 --> 44:04.266
One of Angelica's cluster.

45:13.794 --> 45:16.171
This is the origin
of their zombie factory.

45:16.255 --> 45:18.424
Means Kolovi knew about it
from the beginning.

45:18.507 --> 45:20.342
These are early experiments of the men

45:20.426 --> 45:23.345
who I believe are responsible
for your son's disappearance.

45:24.096 --> 45:25.848
That one is Professor Kolovi.

45:26.515 --> 45:29.810
I showed him a picture of my son
and he denied ever meeting him.

45:32.521 --> 45:35.023
What did your journalistic intuition
tell you about him?

45:36.191 --> 45:42.197
He's a lying snake who would open his own
mother's throat if he could profit by it.

45:50.497 --> 45:52.541
When was the last time he spoke to Raoul?

45:54.835 --> 45:57.171
When was the last time you spoke to Raoul?

46:01.258 --> 46:06.180
I believe he called me
just before he vanished.

46:07.306 --> 46:08.891
[phone rings]

46:10.517 --> 46:11.518
Yes?

46:12.519 --> 46:13.687
Hello?

46:14.813 --> 46:16.148
Hello?

46:18.984 --> 46:20.235
Raoul?

46:21.820 --> 46:23.322
Raoul, is it you?

46:27.201 --> 46:28.702
Where are you?

46:30.329 --> 46:31.538
Listen...

46:45.511 --> 46:46.803
I love you.

47:20.379 --> 47:25.759
I don't know what an actor can do to help
put the memory of my son to rest.

47:27.427 --> 47:29.680
But he obviously thought highly of you.

47:31.265 --> 47:35.102
I hope one day I share that same opinion.

47:44.319 --> 47:47.030
-Do you know where they were headed?
-No.

47:47.114 --> 47:49.658
Would you tell me if you did know, huh?

47:49.741 --> 47:53.370
I'll assume that's another one
of your rhetorical questions.

47:53.453 --> 47:55.122
Yeah, yeah.

48:03.213 --> 48:05.173
[banging]

48:05.257 --> 48:06.758
Back up, Mrs. Cho.

48:06.842 --> 48:08.969
Jun? Jun?

48:22.941 --> 48:24.067
Ms. Bak!

48:30.324 --> 48:31.283
Ms. Bak!

48:39.958 --> 48:42.127
-[gunshot]
-Stop!

48:47.341 --> 48:48.175
Don't move!

48:50.510 --> 48:51.928
Put your hands up!

48:55.098 --> 48:56.475
I said hands up!

48:59.019 --> 48:59.853
Good.

49:04.733 --> 49:08.654
Look... we don't want anybody
to get hurt, right?

49:09.488 --> 49:10.572
Stay still.

49:13.075 --> 49:14.534
Stay still.

49:14.618 --> 49:15.827
Good. Stay still.

49:16.870 --> 49:17.704
Okay.

49:19.956 --> 49:22.125
[grunting]

49:33.595 --> 49:35.305
Uh!

49:36.682 --> 49:37.683
Who are you?

49:41.269 --> 49:42.437
[grunting]

50:06.420 --> 50:08.422
[pants] You're her.

50:11.717 --> 50:13.301
Oh!

50:22.811 --> 50:24.521
I think he's sleeping.

50:26.606 --> 50:27.441
Wow!

50:27.524 --> 50:31.486
That was better
than any movie or TV show.

50:31.570 --> 50:32.446
We should go.

50:35.031 --> 50:37.993
This taste of freedom was delicious.

50:38.535 --> 50:40.579
But enough is enough.

50:42.581 --> 50:45.542
-No.
-I will only slow you down.

50:45.625 --> 50:49.671
Besides, what else can they do to me?

50:49.755 --> 50:50.964
I'm serving life.

50:52.424 --> 50:53.675
I need you.

50:54.426 --> 50:55.510
Go.

50:55.594 --> 50:57.262
Go clear your name.

50:58.430 --> 51:01.016
You and your imaginary friends.

51:03.101 --> 51:07.773
And when you find your brother,
pound him a few times for me.

51:07.856 --> 51:09.191
-Yeah, me too.
-Mm!

51:21.620 --> 51:24.873
When you're free, come visit me.

51:31.505 --> 51:32.672
I will.

51:54.361 --> 51:56.947
[Jonas] Angelica, you're being irrational.

51:57.030 --> 51:58.198
They want to sterilize us.

51:58.281 --> 52:00.325
-It's a voluntary procedure.
-For now.

52:00.408 --> 52:01.993
[Angelica] Even with everything
we've been through,

52:02.077 --> 52:05.705
your first, your only thought,
is for yourself.

52:05.789 --> 52:08.333
-Come with me.
-[Jonas] Please, listen to me.

52:08.416 --> 52:11.211
[Angelica] I don't want to waste
any more time listening to your excuses.

52:11.294 --> 52:12.504
Fuck.

52:13.213 --> 52:14.798
That's it! I'm done.

52:14.881 --> 52:18.927
I'm done with you, I am done with them.
I'm done with all of it.

52:19.010 --> 52:21.179
[Jonas] Angelica, be reasonable.

52:21.263 --> 52:23.390
[Angelica] I don't want
to talk about it anymore.

52:23.473 --> 52:25.183
Where do you think you're going?

52:25.267 --> 52:26.518
Chicago.

52:27.143 --> 52:29.604
Are we dreaming the same dream?

52:29.688 --> 52:31.565
[Jonas] Look, going to Chicago is suicide!

52:31.648 --> 52:32.566
It's not a dream.

52:32.649 --> 52:34.234
I'm sorry.

52:34.317 --> 52:35.527
It's a memory.

52:36.069 --> 52:37.529
I don't need your tears.

52:39.322 --> 52:41.408
I need your fucking courage.

52:51.668 --> 52:52.502
Will.

52:54.796 --> 52:55.630
Will...

53:00.677 --> 53:01.928
Help him.

53:11.271 --> 53:12.272
Jonas.

53:13.565 --> 53:14.566
[Nomi] What's happening?

53:16.943 --> 53:18.236
There's something wrong.

53:19.821 --> 53:20.947
It's Jonas.

53:28.872 --> 53:31.166
I've come to say goodbye.

53:31.249 --> 53:36.254
I thought I had value to them,
but it seems that time has passed.

53:36.338 --> 53:37.672
What's happening?

53:39.299 --> 53:40.759
They're gonna kill him.

53:40.842 --> 53:43.637
They're using me to send you a message.

53:44.638 --> 53:46.431
They want you to watch.

53:46.514 --> 53:48.934
We have to do something. Oh, my God.

53:49.017 --> 53:50.226
[Will] This can't happen.

53:50.310 --> 53:51.978
I'm sorry I failed you.

53:54.773 --> 53:57.525
-Angelica.
-I'm here.

53:59.611 --> 54:02.322
-[laughs]
-I love you.

54:02.405 --> 54:03.907
I love you.

54:05.241 --> 54:08.203
[Angelica] The only lips
I've ever wanted to kiss in my life.

54:11.456 --> 54:12.999
Angelica, I'm afraid.

54:13.083 --> 54:14.542
[Angelica] I'm here.
