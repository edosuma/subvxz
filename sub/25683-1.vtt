01:47.256 --> 01:49.288
We were watching TV
and then I looked over at her,

01:49.290 --> 01:51.358
and she was just
sort of slumped over.

01:51.360 --> 01:53.427
And when was the last time
that she had something

01:53.429 --> 01:54.561
to eat or drink?

01:54.563 --> 01:56.296
About an hour ago, she had...

01:56.298 --> 01:58.665
she was drinking some tea.
She had a couple cookies.

01:58.667 --> 02:00.534
<i>Has she had any
fainting spells recently?</i>

02:00.536 --> 02:01.571
No. Never.

02:03.304 --> 02:04.704
How you doing, Agnes?

02:04.706 --> 02:06.305
You getting better?

02:06.307 --> 02:07.641
<i>Hey, I still need
to try that famous</i>

02:07.643 --> 02:09.008
<i>Bolognese of yours.</i>

02:09.011 --> 02:10.644
How'd you know
about Mom's Bolognese?

02:10.645 --> 02:12.679
<i>Who doesn't?</i>

02:12.681 --> 02:14.514
Good.

02:14.516 --> 02:15.581
Much better. Yeah.

02:15.583 --> 02:17.317
Your blood pressure's up.

02:17.319 --> 02:19.686
I think you just
needed some fluids.

02:19.688 --> 02:21.555
- <i>Do you feel better?</i>
- <i>Is she gonna be okay?</i>

02:21.557 --> 02:22.889
<i>Yeah, her color is coming back</i>

02:22.891 --> 02:24.691
<i>and her heart rate is down.</i>

02:24.693 --> 02:26.892
You just got kind of
wiped out there, huh?

02:26.894 --> 02:28.427
<i>Mm-hm.</i>

02:28.429 --> 02:32.299
Wait a minute.
Are you, um... Susette?

02:32.301 --> 02:33.533
- It's Paulette.
- I knew it was you.

02:33.535 --> 02:34.901
Oh, my God.

02:34.903 --> 02:36.703
Mama, it's Susette.

02:36.705 --> 02:38.739
- <i>Remember her from school?</i>
- <i>I remember you</i>

02:38.741 --> 02:40.706
<i>because you were one of the...</i>

02:40.708 --> 02:42.376
I guess the only parent

02:42.378 --> 02:44.414
who would let me call you
by your first name.

02:45.713 --> 02:48.548
I thought you were so cool.

03:06.668 --> 03:07.437
<i>Paulette!</i>

03:09.637 --> 03:11.437
Look at you!
It's so good to see you

03:11.439 --> 03:12.872
- back in the old neighborhood.
- I know.

03:12.874 --> 03:14.640
- Hi.
- I was just leaving you

03:14.642 --> 03:15.808
- a note with my number.
- Oh, great.

03:15.810 --> 03:17.076
I'm just running
to the hospital

03:17.078 --> 03:18.578
because Mom wants
some of her stuff.

03:18.580 --> 03:20.747
All right. Here you go, and...

03:20.749 --> 03:21.882
it was so great to see you.

03:21.884 --> 03:23.317
- I am calling.
- Great.

03:23.319 --> 03:24.685
- Bye.
- <i>Bye.</i>

03:34.529 --> 03:36.562
<i>Good morning, New London.</i>

03:36.564 --> 03:38.731
<i>Sports and weather
at the bottom of the hour,</i>

03:38.733 --> 03:41.701
<i>and now our top story.</i>

03:41.703 --> 03:43.003
<i>A new jobs report tells us</i>

03:43.005 --> 03:45.404
<i>what you already knew.</i>

03:45.406 --> 03:47.873
<i>The regional economy
isn't getting any better.</i>

03:47.875 --> 03:49.408
<i>This according to economists</i>

03:49.410 --> 03:51.378
<i>from the University
of Connecticut.</i>

03:51.380 --> 03:53.347
<i>Now, they're saying
jobs are scarce,</i>

03:53.349 --> 03:54.781
<i>and that there's no indication</i>

03:54.783 --> 03:56.849
<i>that's going to change
any time soon.</i>

03:56.851 --> 03:59.853
<i>Of course, unemployment has
been a big concern for years,</i>

03:59.855 --> 04:00.920
<i>many finding it difficult</i>

04:00.922 --> 04:02.955
<i>to secure even part-time work.</i>

04:02.957 --> 04:06.626
<i>So, what should we do
about the lousy economy?</i>

04:06.628 --> 04:08.662
<i>Our lines are wide open
right now,</i>

04:08.664 --> 04:11.365
<i>so call us and tell us
what you think...</i>

04:25.814 --> 04:27.781
Holy shit.

05:55.636 --> 05:57.607
Oh, my God.

06:07.583 --> 06:08.551
Shit.

06:55.963 --> 06:59.865
Well, I'd heard somebody
finally bought this place.

06:59.867 --> 07:01.000
I had to meet the person

07:01.002 --> 07:04.170
ballsy enough to paint it pink.

07:04.172 --> 07:06.305
Well, it's not pink.
It's "Odessa Rose".

07:06.307 --> 07:07.940
If you say so.-

07:07.942 --> 07:09.643
Hi. I'm Billy.

07:09.645 --> 07:12.978
- Billy Von Winkle.
- Oh, sorry. Susette Kelo.

07:12.980 --> 07:14.915
Nice to meet you,
Susette Kelo.

07:14.917 --> 07:15.915
<i>Welcome to the neighborhood.</i>

07:15.917 --> 07:17.149
Thank you.

07:17.151 --> 07:18.884
So, how do you like it?

07:18.886 --> 07:19.985
Well, the view sucks.

07:19.987 --> 07:22.021
Other than that, it's nice.

07:22.023 --> 07:23.990
- It's fantastic.
- Yeah.

07:23.992 --> 07:26.893
- Do you live nearby?
- I own the deli on the corner,

07:26.895 --> 07:28.627
and a couple other buildings
that I rent out.

07:28.629 --> 07:29.963
Cool. I've been
meaning to come by.

07:29.965 --> 07:31.764
It's great to have a deli.

07:31.766 --> 07:34.266
- How about now?
- I can't. Thank you, but...

07:34.268 --> 07:36.670
Come on. I'll let you
buy me a cup of coffee.

07:36.672 --> 07:38.905
I just have a lot
of work to do, so...

07:38.907 --> 07:41.110
Come on, Red.
We need the business.

07:43.812 --> 07:45.845
All right. You know,
let me just wash up

07:45.847 --> 07:46.980
and I'll meet you over there.

07:46.982 --> 07:48.081
Welcome to the neighborhood.

07:48.083 --> 07:49.819
- <i>I'll see you there.</i>
- Okay.

07:52.020 --> 07:54.653
- <i>So what's your story?</i>
- What?

07:54.655 --> 07:57.923
- You married? What?
- Oh. Twice.

07:57.925 --> 08:00.225
Yeah. One ex-husband
and one soon to be.

08:00.227 --> 08:02.163
Yeah? Which one
pays the mortgage?

08:04.865 --> 08:06.968
- This one.
- Good for you.

08:07.869 --> 08:10.937
So, what do you do? Huh?

08:10.939 --> 08:13.038
How do you make a living?

08:14.643 --> 08:15.809
I'm a paramedic.

08:15.811 --> 08:17.910
- No kidding, huh?
- Nope.

08:17.912 --> 08:19.278
Well, you'll do good business
in this town.

08:19.280 --> 08:21.247
Half the neighborhood's
on its last legs.

08:21.249 --> 08:22.949
Oh, yeah, I noticed.

08:22.951 --> 08:24.119
Wow.

08:26.054 --> 08:26.752
Man, does it always...

08:26.754 --> 08:29.254
is it like this all the time?

08:29.256 --> 08:31.824
Because it stinks.

08:31.826 --> 08:33.659
You'd think the pastrami
would kind of cover

08:33.660 --> 08:35.894
- the smell of the sewage plant.
- Well, not quite.

08:35.895 --> 08:37.630
I mean, we've been
complaining as far back

08:37.631 --> 08:39.164
as anybody can remember.
What are you gonna do?

08:39.166 --> 08:40.966
It's like talking
to a rock, right?

08:40.967 --> 08:42.302
Which is why I spearheaded

08:42.304 --> 08:44.269
Operation Caca de Pollo.

08:44.270 --> 08:47.006
What? Did you say "Caca"?

08:47.008 --> 08:48.341
I got a couple of big containers

08:48.343 --> 08:50.176
- <i>of chicken shit.</i>
- <i>No!</i>

08:50.178 --> 08:52.245
<i>I brought it to City
Hall, basically, dumped it,</i>

08:52.247 --> 08:54.813
<i>and everyone was gagging
and dry heaving.</i>

08:54.815 --> 08:56.982
<i>It took 'em weeks
to clean it up.</i>

08:56.984 --> 08:58.817
<i>Yeah. But, spent an
afternoon in jail for it</i>

08:58.819 --> 09:00.653
<i>but it was worth it.
It was worth it.</i>

09:00.655 --> 09:02.187
- <i>And I got on Leno.</i>
- <i>You did?</i>

09:02.189 --> 09:05.091
- <i>Jay Leno.</i>
- Was he... was he nice?

09:05.093 --> 09:06.158
- Very nice.
- Yeah.

09:06.160 --> 09:07.729
Very, very nice man.

09:17.238 --> 09:19.905
Your numbers are still strong.

09:19.907 --> 09:22.043
Hell, you've even got
some Democrats who like you.

09:24.112 --> 09:25.945
That is why
you're on my payroll.

09:25.947 --> 09:27.850
You do work miracles.

09:30.184 --> 09:32.121
But I do need one more.

09:34.055 --> 09:35.925
I want you to get me New London.

09:37.125 --> 09:39.893
What the hell's in New London?

09:39.895 --> 09:41.097
Absolutely nothing.

09:47.069 --> 09:49.369
I do like the concept.

09:49.371 --> 09:51.203
I just don't know
who could pull that off.

09:51.205 --> 09:53.038
We need somebody with clout,

09:53.040 --> 09:56.076
integrity, popularity,

09:56.078 --> 09:57.943
not tied to any party.

09:57.945 --> 10:00.980
- Riding in on a unicorn.
- I know someone.

10:00.982 --> 10:04.017
- <i>What's his name?</i>
- Her name...

10:04.019 --> 10:05.719
<i>is Charlotte Wells.</i>

10:07.122 --> 10:10.123
<i>She's president
of Walthrop College...</i>

10:10.125 --> 10:12.491
<i>with a Rolodex to kill for.</i>

10:12.493 --> 10:15.360
<i>PhD in French literature.</i>

10:15.362 --> 10:19.164
<i>Brains, relentless ambition.</i>

10:19.166 --> 10:20.999
<i>And a real charmer,</i>

10:21.001 --> 10:23.937
<i>if you know what I mean.</i>

10:23.939 --> 10:26.972
<i>Even her own husband
has never seen her unkempt,</i>

10:26.974 --> 10:27.976
<i>shall we say.</i>

10:30.344 --> 10:32.912
<i>Those of us who are blessed</i>

10:32.914 --> 10:34.047
with gifts must design

10:34.049 --> 10:36.783
a better world for the poor.

10:36.785 --> 10:39.451
- <i>But first...</i>
- <i>Mr. Governor.</i>

10:39.453 --> 10:41.221
<i>Charlotte Wells
here to see you.</i>

10:41.223 --> 10:43.291
Send her in.

10:46.962 --> 10:48.293
- Charlotte.
- <i>Peter.</i>

10:48.295 --> 10:49.796
Thanks for coming
on such short notice.

10:49.798 --> 10:51.934
Always lovely to see you.

10:54.169 --> 10:55.371
Mr. Governor.

10:57.838 --> 10:59.105
Strong handshake.

10:59.107 --> 11:00.773
Please.

11:00.775 --> 11:02.207
We take this
blighted plot of land

11:02.209 --> 11:03.942
by the sewage treatment plant

11:03.944 --> 11:05.043
and we redevelop it.

11:05.045 --> 11:07.113
We lure a world-class company

11:07.115 --> 11:08.782
to build some high-tech facility

11:08.784 --> 11:11.116
and boom.
Add jobs, tax revenue,

11:11.118 --> 11:12.818
economic miracle.

11:12.820 --> 11:14.120
It'll certainly
compliment the work

11:14.122 --> 11:15.254
you've already been doing.

11:15.256 --> 11:17.791
We rescue a struggling
blue-collar city,

11:17.793 --> 11:19.895
- <i>and everyone wins.</i>
- Well, Mr. Governor...

11:21.262 --> 11:23.296
I've been in the trenches,

11:23.298 --> 11:26.166
and it is a tall task

11:26.168 --> 11:27.966
trying to pull off
something like this

11:27.968 --> 11:29.101
in a town that takes

11:29.103 --> 11:31.370
five years to approve
a stop sign.

11:31.372 --> 11:32.971
All we need is the land.

11:32.973 --> 11:35.107
Land under jurisdiction
of a mayor

11:35.109 --> 11:37.009
who would give zero support.

11:37.011 --> 11:39.479
The State of Connecticut
will make sure that you succeed.

11:39.481 --> 11:41.380
N-L-D-C.

11:41.382 --> 11:43.216
New London
Development Corporation.

11:43.218 --> 11:45.150
It sounds familiar.

11:45.152 --> 11:46.985
NLDC was established in 1978

11:46.987 --> 11:49.254
with the goal of assisting
with economic development.

11:49.256 --> 11:50.389
Oh, that's right.

11:50.391 --> 11:52.225
<i>It's been gathering dust</i>

11:52.227 --> 11:53.326
ever since, so,

11:53.328 --> 11:55.195
we simply dust it off

11:55.197 --> 11:58.163
and give it to you.

11:58.165 --> 12:00.099
How generous.

12:00.101 --> 12:03.336
Now, why would you do that?

12:03.338 --> 12:04.937
<i>You lead the NLDC,</i>

12:04.939 --> 12:07.105
but the city officials
are familiar with it,

12:07.107 --> 12:09.274
so, they're comfortable.

12:09.276 --> 12:11.311
The NLDC finds a worthy project,

12:11.313 --> 12:12.445
and it gets funded

12:12.447 --> 12:14.214
thanks to the governor.

12:14.216 --> 12:16.148
I simply just can't be the face

12:16.150 --> 12:17.517
of the operation, obviously.

12:17.519 --> 12:19.255
Just the mastermind.

12:21.021 --> 12:23.121
I'll tell you what.

12:23.123 --> 12:25.258
Why don't you sleep on it?

12:25.260 --> 12:26.124
I have a fundraiser.

12:30.165 --> 12:31.129
It has been such a pleasure.

12:31.131 --> 12:32.197
Mm-hm.

12:32.199 --> 12:33.368
Hmm.

12:50.184 --> 12:52.284
- Hello?
- <i>Hi, it's Tim LeBlanc here.</i>

12:52.286 --> 12:55.187
<i>Your number came up
on my caller ID.</i>

12:55.189 --> 12:56.522
Oh, I'm sorry.

12:56.524 --> 12:59.057
I must have misdialed.
Sorry about that.

12:59.059 --> 13:01.226
- <i>Okay, well, I thought...</i>
- Thank you.

13:01.228 --> 13:02.495
- <i>...maybe you were the
customer who came in...</i>

13:02.497 --> 13:04.364
Listen, I can't...

13:04.366 --> 13:06.265
I can't buy anything.

13:06.267 --> 13:09.201
I can't donate anything.

13:09.203 --> 13:11.270
I apologize, it was a mistake,

13:11.272 --> 13:14.072
and would you please
take me off your list?

13:14.074 --> 13:15.508
Okay? Thanks a lot.

13:15.510 --> 13:17.076
- Bye-bye.
- <i>Okay.</i>

13:17.078 --> 13:18.613
<i>I'm not actually
a telemarketer...</i>

13:28.223 --> 13:30.226
Oh, shoot.

13:44.072 --> 13:46.205
If you go down this aisle,
you'll see picture frames

13:46.207 --> 13:47.273
up on the... up on the left.

13:47.275 --> 13:48.408
Yeah.

13:51.979 --> 13:54.379
Hi. Tim LeBlanc,
telemarketer speaking.

13:54.381 --> 13:55.948
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

13:55.950 --> 13:57.083
<i>Anyway, are you open right now?</i>

13:57.085 --> 13:59.585
You know what? I'm gonna be here
right up to the point

13:59.587 --> 14:01.486
- where I leave.
- <i>Oh. Good. All right...</i>

14:01.488 --> 14:04.389
- Good. You gonna come by?
- <i>No, I'll come over.</i>

14:04.391 --> 14:06.058
Risk it.

14:06.060 --> 14:07.396
Oh, my God.

14:11.598 --> 14:13.201
Now I have to go.

14:14.669 --> 14:16.269
- I do... I like the red one.
- Yeah.

14:16.271 --> 14:19.138
- It's just...
- Well, everything is half off.

14:19.140 --> 14:20.706
Well, it's just
that one's a little

14:20.708 --> 14:23.408
- out of my price range, so...
- How's that?

14:23.410 --> 14:24.610
- Oh, that's nice.
- All right?

14:24.612 --> 14:26.346
- Yeah.
- That's in excellent shape.

14:26.348 --> 14:28.514
- Cushions are good.
- Oh, they're beautiful.

14:28.516 --> 14:30.383
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

14:30.385 --> 14:34.086
- And everything's a half off.
- Great.

14:34.088 --> 14:36.655
- Even this?
- No, that's a million dollars.

14:36.657 --> 14:38.291
Oh.

14:38.293 --> 14:40.393
Oh, I'm... I...

14:40.395 --> 14:42.095
- do you deliver?
- <i>Sure.</i>

14:42.097 --> 14:44.563
- And... oh, thank you.
- Yeah.

14:44.565 --> 14:46.432
How much would that cost?

14:46.434 --> 14:49.168
How about a meal?

14:49.170 --> 14:49.969
Oh. I got...

14:49.971 --> 14:51.671
it doesn't have
to be a big meal.

14:51.673 --> 14:53.438
<i>Do you take checks?</i>

14:57.277 --> 14:59.512
No. No. Move
Jason to the morning.

14:59.514 --> 15:01.346
<i>Mr. Governor,
I have Charlotte Wells...</i>

15:01.348 --> 15:04.152
- Just a sec.
- <i>...on line one for you.</i>

15:05.386 --> 15:07.552
Is this the call
I've been waiting for?

15:07.554 --> 15:09.455
Well, it very well might be,

15:09.457 --> 15:11.025
Mr. Governor.

15:13.660 --> 15:16.395
Just one question.

15:16.397 --> 15:17.663
Why the sudden interest

15:17.665 --> 15:19.968
in my little town?

15:21.368 --> 15:22.302
Well, I care deeply

15:22.304 --> 15:25.370
about revitalizing
distressed communities.

15:25.372 --> 15:28.273
Well, if you would allow me
to take a wild guess

15:28.275 --> 15:30.342
at another reason...

15:30.344 --> 15:32.412
And what's that, Charlotte?

15:32.414 --> 15:33.413
Republican governor

15:33.415 --> 15:35.748
of Democratic state

15:35.750 --> 15:39.217
rescues struggling
Democratic city?

15:39.219 --> 15:43.322
<i>You're the hero.
You woo plenty of voters.</i>

15:43.324 --> 15:44.423
Maybe even myself

15:44.425 --> 15:46.458
and you win reelection

15:46.460 --> 15:47.559
in a landslide

15:47.561 --> 15:49.461
and more importantly,

15:49.463 --> 15:51.364
that kind of narrative
plays well

15:51.366 --> 15:53.131
on a national stage.

15:53.133 --> 15:55.370
- <i>Am I right?</i>
- Are you in?

15:57.505 --> 15:59.404
It's not gonna be easy

15:59.406 --> 16:00.472
trying to convince

16:00.474 --> 16:02.107
a world-class company

16:02.109 --> 16:04.443
to redevelop next
to a sewage plant.

16:04.445 --> 16:06.412
Well,

16:06.414 --> 16:07.679
you're creative.

16:07.681 --> 16:09.782
I'm sure you have
some great ideas.

16:09.784 --> 16:11.253
Mm-hm.

16:12.786 --> 16:14.419
I'm in.

16:14.421 --> 16:15.654
But you better take my calls

16:15.656 --> 16:17.525
when you're in the White House.

16:20.227 --> 16:23.528
It was nice chatting again
with you, Charlotte.

16:23.530 --> 16:25.034
Au revoir.

16:28.203 --> 16:29.203
Hmm.

16:58.800 --> 17:01.500
<i>And you're back
with the Lyndon and Power Show.</i>

17:01.502 --> 17:03.269
<i>So did you guys hear?
Something called</i>

17:03.271 --> 17:04.804
<i>the New London
Development Corporation</i>

17:04.806 --> 17:06.471
<i>is supposedly gonna rescue
our local economy.</i>

17:06.473 --> 17:08.574
<i>Yeah,
well, good luck with that.</i>

17:08.576 --> 17:09.909
<i>Yeah. We
wanna hear what you think.</i>

17:09.911 --> 17:13.645
Economic development
and social justice,

17:13.646 --> 17:15.448
they go hand in hand.

17:15.450 --> 17:17.249
And with this project,

17:17.251 --> 17:18.351
well, we might actually

17:18.353 --> 17:19.519
make New London hip.

17:20.588 --> 17:23.588
Imagine a Fortune 500 company

17:23.589 --> 17:24.923
in New London.

17:24.925 --> 17:26.828
- Sante.
- Cheers.

17:33.534 --> 17:37.403
Thank you again for joining me
ce soir, Howard.

17:37.405 --> 17:39.438
It's too bad your husband
couldn't join us.

17:39.440 --> 17:42.607
Well, if you
weren't such a slave driver,

17:42.609 --> 17:44.245
David might have been able to.

17:46.947 --> 17:49.414
David tells me you have
some important business

17:49.416 --> 17:50.749
to discuss.

17:50.751 --> 17:53.451
- C'est tellement vrai.
- I'm sorry?

17:53.453 --> 17:54.822
So very true.

17:59.327 --> 18:00.326
Fuck you.

18:00.328 --> 18:01.894
I found the problem.
There's a tampon

18:01.896 --> 18:03.328
- in your faucet.
- Really?

18:03.330 --> 18:04.963
<i>Yeah. Okay, well, I'm gonna go</i>

18:04.965 --> 18:07.900
to the hardware store
and pick you up a toilet kit

18:07.902 --> 18:09.769
'cause your chain's
all fucked up.

18:09.771 --> 18:11.503
Oh, great. I'll just...

18:11.505 --> 18:13.638
I'll pay you back whatever.

18:13.640 --> 18:15.607
- <i>Oh, man.</i>
- This thing.

18:17.544 --> 18:21.346
How much is that thing?
I wanna pay you for that.

18:21.348 --> 18:22.582
Fifty bucks.

18:22.584 --> 18:24.717
<i>Are you kidding?
That was in the junk pile</i>

18:24.719 --> 18:27.653
in the back.
That's not worth 50 bucks.

18:27.655 --> 18:30.623
All right, it's got
a bit of rot. Maybe...

18:30.625 --> 18:32.525
<i>minus pizza,</i>

18:32.527 --> 18:33.659
beer...

18:33.661 --> 18:35.294
- Twenty bucks.
- <i>Okay.</i>

18:35.296 --> 18:36.828
<i>And then if you go
to the hardware store,</i>

18:36.830 --> 18:38.463
<i>I'll pay you back.</i>

18:38.465 --> 18:39.467
Here. Move.

18:42.302 --> 18:43.903
<i>We should probably stain that
before we start</i>

18:43.905 --> 18:46.605
hammering on it.
You know?

18:46.607 --> 18:49.608
<i>I'm tired.</i>

18:49.610 --> 18:51.611
<i>New London Mills is ripe</i>

18:51.613 --> 18:52.778
<i>for development.</i>

18:52.780 --> 18:55.283
All we need is
the right partner.

18:57.618 --> 18:59.919
<i>The city is hungry, Howard.</i>

18:59.921 --> 19:01.787
A project like this

19:01.789 --> 19:03.623
would bring so much good

19:03.625 --> 19:05.460
to so many people.

19:07.028 --> 19:09.961
There.-

19:09.963 --> 19:12.667
- It's funny.
- What's funny?

19:14.368 --> 19:15.968
I don't know how much
David has told you

19:15.970 --> 19:17.569
about what's going on over here.

19:17.571 --> 19:19.672
Not a thing.

19:19.674 --> 19:22.407
Well, I'll tell you,

19:22.409 --> 19:25.944
since it's about to go
public very soon.

19:25.946 --> 19:29.582
We've hit on something big.

19:29.584 --> 19:32.487
So big that we're
gonna need to expand.

19:34.722 --> 19:36.588
Oh, do tell.

19:36.590 --> 19:37.758
What is it?

19:41.928 --> 19:43.996
<i>Don't let erectile dysfunction</i>

19:43.998 --> 19:46.932
<i>get in the way
of your golden years.</i>

19:46.934 --> 19:48.701
<i>Millions of men struggle</i>

19:48.703 --> 19:50.935
<i>with erectile dysfunction.</i>

19:50.937 --> 19:52.971
<i>Get your prescription today.</i>

19:52.973 --> 19:54.573
<i>Results may vary.</i>

19:54.575 --> 19:57.609
<i>Talk to your doctor
about possible side effects.</i>

19:57.611 --> 20:00.346
- <i>Side effects may...</i>
- <i>Tim?</i>

20:00.348 --> 20:01.515
Yeah?

20:06.087 --> 20:09.020
- Voila. What do you think?
- Beautiful.

20:09.022 --> 20:10.024
Yeah.

20:11.626 --> 20:12.758
- I'm gonna kill them.
- Yeah.

20:12.760 --> 20:14.926
Are you my permanent gardener?

20:14.928 --> 20:16.796
All part of the master plan.

20:18.398 --> 20:19.367
Here.

20:22.603 --> 20:23.705
- Oh.
- Hmm.

20:24.905 --> 20:26.705
- Lunch is ready.
- Yeah?

20:26.707 --> 20:29.642
Turkey, cigarette.
Do you have beer?

20:29.644 --> 20:30.976
I got two!

20:30.978 --> 20:32.648
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

20:36.783 --> 20:38.116
Judging by the smell of things,

20:38.118 --> 20:41.322
this is going to be
quite the cleanup job.

20:43.691 --> 20:45.994
Sorry.

20:48.628 --> 20:50.496
Well, I cringe to think

20:50.498 --> 20:52.698
how much it would cost.

20:52.700 --> 20:54.733
We're talking tens of millions

20:54.735 --> 20:57.470
at least.

20:57.472 --> 21:00.673
All right.
Well, hold on a moment.

21:00.675 --> 21:02.674
Let's just look at the positive.

21:02.676 --> 21:03.776
I mean,

21:03.778 --> 21:06.077
you're right across the river.

21:06.079 --> 21:09.781
Everything.
Everything is accessible.

21:09.783 --> 21:12.484
Research facilities.

21:12.486 --> 21:14.886
Hotel for guests.

21:14.888 --> 21:16.855
I don't know, Charlotte.

21:16.857 --> 21:18.694
I don't think this is the spot.

21:22.096 --> 21:23.765
Excuse me, gentlemen.

21:27.068 --> 21:29.835
Do you realize Pfizer

21:29.837 --> 21:33.105
could be New London's savior?

21:33.107 --> 21:36.776
Pfizer is in the pharmaceutical
business, Charlotte,

21:36.778 --> 21:37.779
not the savior business.

21:39.713 --> 21:43.719
Besides, we need
far more space than this.

21:49.890 --> 21:51.092
Thank you, Howard.

21:52.492 --> 21:53.726
For what?

21:53.728 --> 21:56.828
For telling me what you need.

22:00.867 --> 22:02.570
<i>It's so peaceful.</i>

22:03.738 --> 22:05.805
<i>I feel happy here.</i>

22:05.807 --> 22:07.972
<i>I feel like I'm home.</i>

22:07.974 --> 22:10.078
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

22:16.850 --> 22:18.419
I love you.

22:24.692 --> 22:26.461
That's... I mean...

22:28.628 --> 22:32.096
- <i>What?</i>
- No. Just...

22:32.098 --> 22:33.766
- I'm surprised. That's all.
- <i>Okay.</i>

22:33.768 --> 22:35.835
I wasn't expecting...

22:35.837 --> 22:36.969
I was just thinking

22:36.971 --> 22:39.204
how nice it is how...

22:39.206 --> 22:42.708
that we're friends, and I...

22:42.710 --> 22:44.977
I love that, and...

22:44.979 --> 22:47.579
I just want it to...

22:47.581 --> 22:50.516
- kind of be this way.
- Nothing stays the same,

22:50.518 --> 22:51.553
you know?

22:56.857 --> 22:58.723
I know.

22:58.725 --> 22:59.892
Can't we...

22:59.894 --> 23:01.894
you know, just be

23:01.896 --> 23:04.128
the way we are?

23:04.130 --> 23:05.998
This is wonderful.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.200
I'd have to think about that.

23:08.202 --> 23:09.938
- Okay.
- Thanks for lunch.

23:30.625 --> 23:32.958
This better be good.

23:32.960 --> 23:34.759
The governor asked me

23:34.761 --> 23:36.961
to pass along
three numbers to you.

23:36.963 --> 23:39.835
- Okay.
- Zero.

23:41.234 --> 23:43.903
The number of sewage
treatment plants

23:43.905 --> 23:45.674
Pfizer will have to bother with.

23:47.908 --> 23:49.842
And?

23:49.844 --> 23:51.146
Seventy-five million.

23:52.547 --> 23:54.046
The amount of state funding

23:54.048 --> 23:55.548
that the governor will commit

23:55.550 --> 23:57.583
to ensure Pfizer's
successful expansion

23:57.585 --> 23:58.920
into New London.

24:01.856 --> 24:03.321
What's the third number?

24:03.323 --> 24:05.924
That's entirely up to you.

24:05.926 --> 24:07.992
I don't follow.

24:07.994 --> 24:09.964
How many acres do you need?

24:16.136 --> 24:17.869
- All right.
- Welcome to New London,

24:17.871 --> 24:19.139
Mr. Munson.

24:22.842 --> 24:24.211
Damn, it stinks.

24:32.153 --> 24:33.986
<i>Hi, this is Tim.</i>

24:33.988 --> 24:35.921
<i>I'm either not home
or I'm screening my calls</i>

24:35.923 --> 24:37.789
<i>because I'm avoiding someone.</i>

24:37.791 --> 24:39.860
<i>If I don't call you back,
it's you.</i>

26:01.308 --> 26:03.976
- Hi.
- Hi there.

26:03.978 --> 26:05.911
How are you?

26:05.913 --> 26:06.915
Good.

26:08.115 --> 26:10.082
- Can I help?
- No.

26:10.084 --> 26:11.753
- I'm good.
- No? Okay.

26:14.187 --> 26:16.055
So, how have you been?

26:16.057 --> 26:17.258
All right.

26:26.067 --> 26:28.933
Well... I just...

26:28.935 --> 26:30.301
you said you were
gonna think about it

26:30.303 --> 26:33.005
and I haven't heard
from you, so...

26:33.007 --> 26:34.275
I'm still thinking.

26:37.211 --> 26:39.314
Okay. Yeah.

26:42.015 --> 26:43.684
I just wanted to say I miss you.

26:45.051 --> 26:46.353
I miss you too.

26:47.988 --> 26:49.157
I do.

26:57.964 --> 26:58.966
Well...

27:03.037 --> 27:04.072
I'll see you.

27:29.463 --> 27:31.363
<i>Guess who's coming to town?</i>

27:31.365 --> 27:32.897
<i>Iron Maiden.</i>

27:32.899 --> 27:34.165
Pfizer expansion

27:34.167 --> 27:38.136
may bring more than 1,000 jobs.

27:38.138 --> 27:39.471
Blah...

27:39.473 --> 27:43.008
New London
Development Corporation

27:43.010 --> 27:46.878
non-profit is redeveloping

27:46.880 --> 27:48.079
I guess for Pfizer

27:48.081 --> 27:49.147
in the historic

27:49.149 --> 27:51.316
Fort Trumbull neighborhood.

27:55.522 --> 27:57.122
Hi.

27:57.124 --> 27:59.357
- Mrs. Kelo. How are you?
- Yes. Hello.

27:59.359 --> 28:00.992
- It's Kelo. Thank you.
- Oh, Kelo. Sorry.

28:00.994 --> 28:02.227
Can I help you with something?

28:02.229 --> 28:03.428
I'm Lynn Vargas.
I'm a realtor

28:03.430 --> 28:05.263
working with the NLDC.

28:05.265 --> 28:08.232
Do you have
a few moments to chat?

28:08.234 --> 28:10.568
- Sure. Please come on in.
- Okay. Thank you.

28:10.570 --> 28:12.203
Can I get you
something to drink?

28:12.205 --> 28:13.305
No, I'm fine. Thanks.

28:13.307 --> 28:16.842
Wow. It looks
really nice in here.

28:16.844 --> 28:18.210
I take it you've done
quite the renovation

28:18.212 --> 28:19.310
on this place.

28:19.312 --> 28:21.046
<i>I have. I love it.</i>

28:21.048 --> 28:22.513
Thank you. Have a seat, please.

28:22.515 --> 28:25.249
- Thank you.
- Sure.

28:25.251 --> 28:27.152
- So...
- Hmm.

28:27.154 --> 28:29.453
...the NLDC would like
to make you an offer

28:29.455 --> 28:30.858
to buy your house.

28:33.194 --> 28:35.227
Oh, but it's not for sale.

28:35.229 --> 28:37.162
But we're offering
you 68,000 dollars.

28:37.164 --> 28:40.100
That's significantly more
than what you paid for it.

28:42.435 --> 28:44.102
I don't want to sell it.

28:44.104 --> 28:46.270
Thank you.

28:46.272 --> 28:47.538
Mrs. Kelo,
we're making you a...

28:47.540 --> 28:49.473
- It's Kelo.
- Kelo, excuse me.

28:49.475 --> 28:51.108
- We're making you a...
- No problem.

28:51.110 --> 28:53.478
...a very generous offer
on this house.

28:53.480 --> 28:56.280
I'm sure you're aware
of the redevelopments?

28:56.282 --> 28:58.150
No, not really.

28:58.152 --> 29:00.285
<i>Well, your property
is in the area designated</i>

29:00.287 --> 29:01.956
<i>for the expansion effort.</i>

29:04.558 --> 29:06.090
Let me ask you something.

29:06.092 --> 29:07.461
Do you work for Pfizer?

29:08.963 --> 29:12.897
No. New London
Development Corporation.

29:12.899 --> 29:16.367
But it's for Pfizer
ultimately, right?

29:16.369 --> 29:18.973
- Not exactly.
- Then who exactly is it for?

29:23.010 --> 29:25.877
It doesn't matter.
Either way, I don't wanna sell.

29:25.879 --> 29:27.880
But thank you so much.
It was a pleasure to meet you.

29:27.882 --> 29:29.115
- Oh.
- And I appreciate it.

29:29.117 --> 29:31.316
- <i>Thanks for coming by.</i>
- Well, you know, I have a card

29:31.318 --> 29:34.152
- that I would love to give to you.
- Great. You can just leave it

29:34.154 --> 29:36.153
right there in the mailbox,
and I'll get them all later.

29:36.155 --> 29:37.923
- Oh, sorry. Okay.
- Thank you so much.

29:37.925 --> 29:40.895
- If you'd like to discuss...
- Take care. Bye-bye.

29:43.129 --> 29:44.128
Hello.

29:44.130 --> 29:46.265
So that's why I'm here.
I wanted to talk to you

29:46.267 --> 29:47.465
about the exciting
new development...

29:47.467 --> 29:49.334
I strongly suggest
that you sell.

29:49.336 --> 29:51.536
What will happen
to this area is just unbelievable,

29:51.538 --> 29:53.638
and we are so excited
to be a part of it.

29:53.640 --> 29:55.207
I think you're going
to be excited too

29:55.209 --> 29:56.307
<i>once you see
what the possibilities</i>

29:56.309 --> 29:57.576
<i>are in your neighborhood.</i>

29:57.578 --> 29:59.310
<i>Look, if you wait,</i>

29:59.312 --> 30:01.179
<i>we may not be able
to offer you market value,</i>

30:01.181 --> 30:03.214
<i>which is what you'd get
right now.</i>

30:03.216 --> 30:04.182
<i>This check allows us to option</i>

30:04.184 --> 30:06.351
<i>your property for purchase.</i>

30:33.947 --> 30:36.480
<i>"Please contact
an NLDC representative</i>

30:36.482 --> 30:38.249
<i>at your earliest..."</i>

30:38.251 --> 30:40.051
- are you listening?
- <i>Yeah!</i>

30:40.053 --> 30:42.520
Okay. "At your
earliest convenience.

30:42.522 --> 30:44.221
It is not our intention

30:44.223 --> 30:46.391
to cause any
unnecessary hardship

30:46.393 --> 30:48.259
and we will...

30:48.261 --> 30:50.095
we will endeavor

30:50.097 --> 30:51.363
to make your move

30:51.365 --> 30:53.265
as convenient as possible.

30:53.267 --> 30:54.633
Sincerely, Charlotte Wells."

30:54.635 --> 30:56.367
Oh, I'm sure, Charlotte Wells.

30:56.369 --> 30:58.336
<i>Do we at least
get some free Viagra?</i>

30:58.338 --> 31:02.340
- I don't believe this stuff.
- I mean, not for me, obviously.

31:02.342 --> 31:05.042
Who is... who is this person?

31:05.044 --> 31:07.712
These letters are more and more
frickin' ridiculous.

31:07.714 --> 31:10.248
I mean, they really think
I'm gonna move.

31:10.250 --> 31:11.516
Hey.

31:11.518 --> 31:12.984
Here, give me a hug, baby.

31:12.986 --> 31:14.987
No, Tim. You know,
it's not funny.

31:14.989 --> 31:16.654
- You're not even listening to me. Forget it.
- Yes, I am.

31:16.656 --> 31:19.426
- Where are you going?
- <i>I'm gonna go for a walk.</i>

31:22.296 --> 31:25.663
Billy! Did you get that letter?

31:25.665 --> 31:27.999
I mean, they're relentless.
They're idiots.

31:28.001 --> 31:29.136
I'm so pissed.

31:30.570 --> 31:31.702
Yeah. Susette, look.

31:31.704 --> 31:34.038
I can barely make my payroll.

31:34.040 --> 31:35.707
- I know.
- <i>So...</i>

31:35.709 --> 31:37.308
I'm thinking maybe
it's not such a bad thing.

31:37.310 --> 31:39.310
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no, no. Hang on, hang on.

31:39.312 --> 31:41.313
So, right, I make
a couple of bucks finally.

31:41.315 --> 31:43.781
You're kidding, right?
I mean, you're kidding.

31:43.783 --> 31:45.416
<i>Don't do that.
No, don't do that.</i>

31:45.418 --> 31:47.285
- Me, don't do that?
- No, no, no, hang on.

31:47.287 --> 31:49.020
<i>You don't do that.
You don't do that.</i>

31:49.022 --> 31:50.654
You see anybody lining up
to get in here? I don't!

31:50.656 --> 31:52.356
You are not gonna sell.
Please, Billy.

31:52.358 --> 31:53.491
<i>You're not gonna sell, please.</i>

31:53.493 --> 31:54.792
I gave them a number.

31:54.794 --> 31:56.361
If they match it, we got a deal,

31:56.363 --> 31:57.966
- I told them.
- Oh, my God.

32:00.033 --> 32:01.365
Okay.

32:01.367 --> 32:02.666
That's great.

32:02.668 --> 32:05.470
That sucks! That sucks!

32:05.472 --> 32:06.607
<i>Susette, come on!</i>

32:13.079 --> 32:15.480
Oh. Mrs. Kelo! Hi!

32:15.482 --> 32:18.450
- Hi.
- Mrs. Kelo, I have great news.

32:18.452 --> 32:20.585
They've agreed
to increase their offer

32:20.587 --> 32:22.453
by 10,000 dollars.

32:22.455 --> 32:24.088
- Over market value.
- Really?

32:24.090 --> 32:25.790
- Yes!
- Oh, wow.

32:25.792 --> 32:27.425
You know,
I never noticed that locket.

32:27.427 --> 32:29.795
- It's beautiful.
- Oh.

32:29.797 --> 32:31.395
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

32:31.397 --> 32:34.165
- It was my great grandmother's.
- Oh. Yeah.

32:34.167 --> 32:36.233
Would you be interested
in selling it?

32:36.235 --> 32:38.502
Oh. No. It's an heirloom, so...

32:38.504 --> 32:40.605
500? 1,000?

32:40.607 --> 32:42.740
2,000? I'll give you...

32:42.742 --> 32:46.444
What would it take, Lynn?

32:46.446 --> 32:48.747
Mrs. Kelo,
If you don't sell now,

32:48.749 --> 32:51.415
the NLDC could pursue
acquiring the property

32:51.417 --> 32:52.719
through other means.

32:54.488 --> 32:55.490
Hmm.

32:57.758 --> 33:00.061
Okay. Thank you
for telling me that.

33:01.761 --> 33:05.032
Will you do me a favor
and just relay a message?

33:06.265 --> 33:07.598
Tell them...

33:07.600 --> 33:08.770
good luck.

33:11.137 --> 33:12.369
<i>Okay?</i>

33:12.371 --> 33:13.540
Thank you, Lynn.

33:15.709 --> 33:17.445
Listen, you take care.

33:28.454 --> 33:29.656
Thank you.

33:32.459 --> 33:33.525
Hi. Sorry.

33:33.527 --> 33:35.192
Hey. That's okay.

33:35.194 --> 33:36.196
I just got here.

33:37.598 --> 33:39.230
I think I might
have figured out

33:39.232 --> 33:40.499
what your new
best friend meant

33:40.501 --> 33:41.469
by "other means".

33:42.603 --> 33:44.903
Oh, yeah? What's that?

33:44.905 --> 33:47.271
Hi, I'll just...
a pint of beer.

33:47.273 --> 33:48.339
Thank you.

33:48.341 --> 33:49.641
What is that?

33:49.643 --> 33:50.808
In the Constitution,

33:50.810 --> 33:53.478
in the Fifth Amendment, there...

33:53.480 --> 33:56.147
listen, it's eminent domain.

33:56.149 --> 33:58.517
They can take your home,
they can take your land,

33:58.519 --> 34:00.317
if they wanna build a hospital,

34:00.319 --> 34:03.855
highway, school,
something for public use.

34:03.857 --> 34:06.657
But nobody's talking about

34:06.659 --> 34:08.292
building a highway
or hospital.

34:08.293 --> 34:09.527
I know.

34:09.530 --> 34:10.362
They just want my home.

34:11.764 --> 34:15.933
How could somebody
break into my house

34:15.935 --> 34:17.333
and take everything I have

34:17.335 --> 34:18.402
and go to jail?

34:18.405 --> 34:19.571
Hell, you could shoot 'em.

34:19.572 --> 34:21.406
I could shoot them!

34:21.408 --> 34:22.438
I could kill them.

34:22.440 --> 34:23.507
But if they want
the whole thing,

34:23.510 --> 34:24.574
it's perfectly legal.

34:24.577 --> 34:27.411
Perfectly legal.

34:27.414 --> 34:29.315
- Are you kidding me?
- <i>No.</i>

34:33.687 --> 34:36.620
Oh, my God.

34:36.621 --> 34:37.888
I'm freaking out.

34:37.889 --> 34:39.956
This land is everything
I have, Tim.

34:39.958 --> 34:41.692
It's all I own,
it's the only thing

34:41.694 --> 34:44.630
that protects me from them.

34:51.504 --> 34:52.636
<i>Uh, hello.</i>

34:52.638 --> 34:54.638
<i>I'm here to see
Charlotte Wells.</i>

34:54.639 --> 34:55.706
<i>And your name?</i>

34:55.708 --> 34:57.611
Susette Kelo.

35:02.915 --> 35:04.749
<i>There's a Susette Kelo here</i>

35:04.751 --> 35:06.521
<i>to see you.</i>

35:07.888 --> 35:10.522
Well, I did hear, or read,

35:10.524 --> 35:12.591
that Pfizer was...

35:12.593 --> 35:13.591
wants to build in Fort Trumbull.

35:13.593 --> 35:14.859
Is that true?

35:14.861 --> 35:16.394
Oh, yes.

35:16.396 --> 35:18.997
Yes. Once we take care
of the blight in the area,

35:18.999 --> 35:21.665
we can finally
make this city hip.

35:21.667 --> 35:23.701
It's very...
it's very exciting.

35:23.703 --> 35:25.370
Is that...

35:25.372 --> 35:26.470
this is my house.

35:28.642 --> 35:30.575
- Where?
- <i>It's right there.</i>

35:30.577 --> 35:32.479
It's right in the blight.

35:36.716 --> 35:41.685
Well, you have an exquisite view
of the river.

35:41.687 --> 35:43.020
Yeah.

35:43.022 --> 35:45.656
I don't really care
how exciting all of this is.

35:45.658 --> 35:46.890
I just...
nobody can force me

35:46.892 --> 35:48.526
out of my own home.

35:48.528 --> 35:50.694
Oh, no... oh.

35:50.696 --> 35:53.564
No one is forcing you, Susette.

35:53.566 --> 35:55.533
We wanna buy your home.

35:55.535 --> 35:56.801
I don't wanna sell it.

35:56.803 --> 35:58.270
I don't wanna sell it.

35:58.272 --> 36:02.774
Right, but your house
is in a parcel

36:02.776 --> 36:05.542
that has been designated

36:05.544 --> 36:07.544
for the redevelopment plan.

36:07.546 --> 36:09.881
<i>The city will help
relocate you.</i>

36:09.883 --> 36:11.549
I mean, this is a collaboration

36:11.551 --> 36:13.551
between us and the residents.

36:13.553 --> 36:16.520
Well, how are we...

36:16.522 --> 36:18.522
collaborating?

36:18.524 --> 36:19.957
Well, we'll work together

36:19.959 --> 36:21.859
and come to a mutual agreement.

36:21.861 --> 36:23.461
Oh, I'll never agree.

36:23.463 --> 36:25.497
There's no other house

36:25.499 --> 36:28.600
with this "exquisite view"
of the water

36:28.602 --> 36:31.636
that I could afford.

36:31.638 --> 36:33.638
Susette.

36:33.640 --> 36:35.973
Have you ever worked
with the poor?

36:35.975 --> 36:37.975
<i>Those people standing around</i>

36:37.977 --> 36:41.680
<i>outside of those
vacant storefronts,</i>

36:41.682 --> 36:42.680
in your neighborhood.

36:42.682 --> 36:43.982
I talk to them.

36:43.984 --> 36:46.817
You should see
their faces light up

36:46.819 --> 36:49.390
when they hear about
all of this.

36:50.756 --> 36:52.726
What about eminent domain?

36:54.428 --> 36:55.694
It's an option.

36:55.696 --> 36:56.895
But only as a last resort

36:56.897 --> 36:59.367
if people refuse to sell.

37:01.033 --> 37:06.337
If you even try to take
my property away from me,

37:06.339 --> 37:08.975
the whole world
is gonna hear about it.

37:20.821 --> 37:21.886
I want to set up a meeting

37:21.888 --> 37:23.587
with the Fort Trumbull residents

37:23.589 --> 37:26.493
and nip this in the bud
before it spreads.

37:29.463 --> 37:31.696
Hi. My name is Susette Kelo.

37:31.698 --> 37:32.830
I live in Fort Trumbull

37:32.832 --> 37:34.098
and I need to talk
to the Mayor please,

37:34.100 --> 37:35.834
- right away.
- <i>Okay.</i>

37:35.836 --> 37:38.906
<i>And can I tell him
what this is regarding?</i>

37:39.939 --> 37:41.138
It's regarding the people

37:41.140 --> 37:44.042
who are trying
to steal my house.

37:44.044 --> 37:45.810
<i>Okay. Please hold.</i>

37:45.812 --> 37:47.645
Well, I'll tell you,
I can see why they want

37:47.647 --> 37:49.814
this place.

37:49.816 --> 37:52.750
<i>Come on, Beachy.</i>

37:52.752 --> 37:53.953
<i>Is this real?</i>

37:54.854 --> 37:56.589
It might be.

37:57.957 --> 38:00.625
Is there anything
you can do to help us?

38:00.627 --> 38:01.692
<i>Well, Susette,</i>

38:01.694 --> 38:02.794
<i>the way city government works,</i>

38:02.796 --> 38:05.763
in particular New London,

38:05.765 --> 38:07.899
my options
are a little bit limited.

38:07.901 --> 38:10.033
But if you get out there,

38:10.035 --> 38:11.636
start knocking on doors,

38:11.638 --> 38:13.037
get people engaged,

38:13.039 --> 38:14.671
<i>gather up some letters
from everybody,</i>

38:14.673 --> 38:15.807
<i>I can take those letters</i>

38:15.809 --> 38:18.176
<i>down to City Council.</i>

38:18.178 --> 38:20.845
Because then I'll have
your support.

38:20.847 --> 38:23.180
And that gives me
a little bit more power.

38:23.182 --> 38:25.183
But you have to hit
the ground running.

38:25.185 --> 38:26.683
You understand?

38:26.685 --> 38:28.886
Rally the troops.

38:28.888 --> 38:30.091
We have troops?

38:32.691 --> 38:33.758
My name's Susette Kelo.

38:33.760 --> 38:34.691
I live in the pink house.

38:34.693 --> 38:37.095
<i>We're having Saturday cleanup,</i>

38:37.097 --> 38:39.430
<i>so please come if you're free.</i>

38:39.432 --> 38:40.932
And bring people.
Please. Yeah.

38:40.934 --> 38:42.600
Yeah. Invite friends.

38:42.602 --> 38:44.435
Thank you.

38:44.437 --> 38:46.837
Stop trying
to give them both.

38:46.839 --> 38:48.973
We don't have to give
each person in a couple one.

38:48.975 --> 38:50.841
It's just a waste.

38:50.843 --> 38:53.076
So I'm having this gathering
on Saturday.

38:53.078 --> 38:55.046
Invited most of the people
in the neighborhood.

38:55.048 --> 38:57.714
My house is that pink one.

39:03.789 --> 39:05.089
- Hey.
- Hi.

39:05.091 --> 39:06.991
You brought your own rake.
How great.

39:06.993 --> 39:09.060
If you don't mind signing in,

39:09.062 --> 39:10.462
and your address,

39:10.464 --> 39:11.830
even though I know
where you are.

39:11.832 --> 39:13.765
- Thank you.
- Hey, Dobbs.

39:13.767 --> 39:15.136
Thanks for coming in.

39:17.169 --> 39:20.872
I've been living here
for 40 years.

39:20.874 --> 39:22.105
To be a bus driver,

39:22.107 --> 39:23.640
and have a view
like this, huh?

39:23.642 --> 39:24.741
It's incredible.

39:24.743 --> 39:26.144
And that's why
we have to fight.

39:26.146 --> 39:28.912
I don't think this is gonna make
any difference.

39:28.914 --> 39:30.180
Look, I know these people.

39:30.182 --> 39:31.851
I don't want to join a group
of whiners.

39:33.819 --> 39:36.122
Well, will you at least
write a letter?

39:37.022 --> 39:38.925
This is all gonna blow over.

39:40.526 --> 39:42.060
Please?

39:42.062 --> 39:44.194
Oh, what the hell?

39:44.196 --> 39:45.129
Okay.

39:45.131 --> 39:47.765
I thought I was the bad one,
but really,

39:47.767 --> 39:48.765
your daughter was the bad one.

39:48.767 --> 39:51.069
- No, she instigated everything.
- No, I didn't.

39:51.071 --> 39:53.805
- Oh, stop.
- No, I didn't.

39:53.807 --> 39:57.077
My husband gave up the ghost
in this house.

39:58.245 --> 40:01.111
It's where he wanted to be.

40:01.113 --> 40:03.113
And it's where I want to be too

40:03.115 --> 40:05.616
when my time comes.

40:05.618 --> 40:07.951
My wife and I grew up
in this neighborhood.

40:07.953 --> 40:09.720
<i>Oh.</i>

40:09.722 --> 40:12.957
This is the only house
we've ever lived in.

40:12.959 --> 40:15.993
We raised our children here.

40:15.995 --> 40:19.596
This is my home.

40:19.598 --> 40:22.000
We want...

40:22.002 --> 40:24.801
to stay...

40:24.803 --> 40:25.939
here.

40:41.086 --> 40:43.754
Good evening.

40:43.756 --> 40:45.089
Charlotte!

40:45.091 --> 40:46.558
Good evening.

40:49.930 --> 40:51.895
Well, I love a man

40:51.897 --> 40:53.031
who yells my name.

40:54.767 --> 40:57.267
Woo!

40:57.269 --> 40:59.270
Folks...

40:59.272 --> 41:02.040
I know there's been
a lot of speculation

41:02.042 --> 41:04.075
about what's going on
in the neighborhood,

41:04.077 --> 41:06.944
and I thought it would be good

41:06.946 --> 41:08.779
to get together tonight

41:08.781 --> 41:10.682
and talk about it.

41:10.684 --> 41:12.118
Now first...

41:14.588 --> 41:16.287
let me tell you

41:16.289 --> 41:19.957
about a new vision
for New London.

41:19.959 --> 41:22.627
And I am here tonight

41:22.629 --> 41:26.196
to invite each
and every one of you

41:26.198 --> 41:27.899
to be a part of our team

41:27.901 --> 41:29.968
to create this vision.

41:29.970 --> 41:34.939
A New London
that is vital and hip.

41:36.843 --> 41:39.076
Hip? You mean...

41:39.078 --> 41:41.044
"High Income People" hip?

41:46.086 --> 41:48.218
All right. All right, please.

41:48.220 --> 41:50.321
Please everyone,
let's keep this civil.

41:50.323 --> 41:52.022
- What?
- <i>Oh, okay.</i>

41:52.024 --> 41:53.323
While we're keeping it civil

41:53.325 --> 41:54.926
you'll be stealing our homes.

41:54.928 --> 41:56.026
Is that right?

41:56.028 --> 41:56.894
<i>No, no, no.</i>

41:56.896 --> 41:58.363
That is not true.

41:58.365 --> 42:00.698
Everyone, no final decisions

42:00.700 --> 42:01.665
have been made.

42:01.667 --> 42:04.669
We are still looking
into every alternative.

42:04.671 --> 42:05.903
<i>Well, then why did you fire</i>

42:05.905 --> 42:07.305
the engineering firm
that suggested

42:07.307 --> 42:09.774
these homes might be spared?

42:09.776 --> 42:10.841
Well...

42:10.843 --> 42:13.276
Well, actually,
they weren't fired.

42:13.278 --> 42:15.812
Their work was done and...

42:15.814 --> 42:16.948
we both moved on.

42:16.950 --> 42:18.049
Oh, oh, excuse me.

42:18.051 --> 42:19.783
You moved on because Pfizer

42:19.785 --> 42:21.151
told you to move on.

42:21.153 --> 42:22.687
<i>You're all a bunch
of kiss-asses!</i>

42:22.689 --> 42:24.154
Let me be clear,

42:24.156 --> 42:26.957
because I know that there are

42:26.959 --> 42:29.694
some of you who view
this redevelopment

42:29.696 --> 42:30.595
as a bad thing.

42:30.597 --> 42:32.997
<i>I'm sorry, but do you see</i>

42:32.999 --> 42:36.066
kicking us out of our homes
as a bad thing?

42:36.068 --> 42:37.267
- <i>You don't think it's bad.</i>
- <i>Exactly!</i>

42:37.269 --> 42:40.171
I assure you
no one wants to kick you

42:40.173 --> 42:41.439
out of your homes.

42:42.975 --> 42:45.375
You sure got a
funny way of showing it.

42:45.377 --> 42:46.843
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

42:54.888 --> 42:59.290
Please understand
our perspective here.

42:59.292 --> 43:02.694
The most important thing
to us, to me,

43:02.696 --> 43:05.062
and I'm sure you'll all agree,

43:05.064 --> 43:07.698
is to help those in need.

43:09.068 --> 43:10.935
Yes.

43:10.937 --> 43:13.738
The jobless, the homeless,

43:13.740 --> 43:16.841
the people on the fringes
of society,

43:16.843 --> 43:19.877
they will benefit the most
from this plan.

43:19.879 --> 43:21.212
How?

43:21.214 --> 43:23.247
Pfizer's expansion to New London

43:23.249 --> 43:25.348
will increase
this city's tax revenue

43:25.350 --> 43:29.220
by $12 million a year.

43:30.890 --> 43:33.825
We are only
here to make this city

43:33.827 --> 43:35.493
that you live
in a better place.

43:35.495 --> 43:37.962
Who decides
what a better place is?

43:37.964 --> 43:39.129
You?

43:39.131 --> 43:40.865
Oh, no. No, no.

43:40.867 --> 43:41.999
Not me.

43:42.001 --> 43:43.133
Your community wants this.

43:43.135 --> 43:45.102
- No.
- Oh, yes.

43:45.104 --> 43:46.837
And your city needs this.

43:46.839 --> 43:49.073
Charlotte. Charlotte.

43:49.075 --> 43:50.341
What are you gonna do

43:50.343 --> 43:52.243
so that these people
can keep their homes?

43:52.245 --> 43:54.745
Yeah, that's right. Yeah.

43:54.747 --> 43:57.147
The best course for us
to improve our city

43:57.149 --> 43:59.116
would be to acquire
all the homes.

43:59.118 --> 44:00.917
What? This is bullshit!

44:02.021 --> 44:03.854
This is bullshit!

44:03.856 --> 44:04.888
It's bullshit.

44:04.890 --> 44:06.424
<i>It's absolute bullshit.</i>

44:06.426 --> 44:07.991
You're gonna help the homeless

44:07.993 --> 44:10.026
by kicking people
out of their homes?

44:10.028 --> 44:12.095
<i>Where do you people get off?</i>

44:12.097 --> 44:14.031
- <i>This is unbelievable.</i>
- <i>No. I think I get it.</i>

44:14.033 --> 44:15.235
I...

44:19.205 --> 44:21.339
You took one look
at our neighborhood

44:21.341 --> 44:24.341
and saw this great water view

44:24.343 --> 44:27.145
and said,
"Hey, this is pretty nice.

44:27.147 --> 44:29.113
What are all these scumbags
doing here?"

44:29.115 --> 44:30.180
Yeah. Yeah!

44:30.182 --> 44:31.915
No. No, no, no, no.

44:31.917 --> 44:35.051
"Their houses
aren't good enough.

44:35.053 --> 44:37.087
They can't be next to Pfizer.

44:37.089 --> 44:39.557
They just don't fit in."

44:39.559 --> 44:41.225
<i>That's right. That's right.</i>

44:41.227 --> 44:42.894
No. Here's the thing.

44:42.896 --> 44:44.995
Social justice

44:44.997 --> 44:47.330
and economic development,

44:47.332 --> 44:49.267
they go hand in hand.

44:53.106 --> 44:56.042
Do you think we fit in?

44:57.443 --> 44:58.975
Susette, I would like to think

44:58.977 --> 45:00.981
there's a place here
for all of us.

45:03.048 --> 45:05.985
- Thank you.
- <i>What does that mean?</i>

45:08.287 --> 45:10.020
Any other comments?

45:26.539 --> 45:28.839
<i>Pfizer tells the
NLDC what it wants,</i>

45:28.841 --> 45:31.142
<i>the NLDC goes over
to the governor's office,</i>

45:31.144 --> 45:33.477
<i>they funnel all the money
back to the NLDC</i>

45:33.479 --> 45:35.946
<i>to make all Pfizer's dreams
come true.</i>

45:35.948 --> 45:37.348
<i>They got Charlotte
talking to Pfizer,</i>

45:37.350 --> 45:38.415
<i>Pfizer's talking to Charlotte.</i>

45:38.417 --> 45:40.116
<i>At one point, she even says,</i>

45:40.118 --> 45:42.352
<i>"I don't want Pfizer
to have to look down</i>

45:42.354 --> 45:44.321
<i>on the tenements.</i>

45:44.323 --> 45:46.223
Sleazy, yeah.

45:46.225 --> 45:48.024
But not necessarily illegal.

45:48.026 --> 45:50.394
The city takes our property
by force,

45:50.396 --> 45:51.962
using our own tax money,

45:51.964 --> 45:54.131
sells it back to Pfizer
for a fucking dollar?

45:54.133 --> 45:56.100
In what fantasy world
is that legal?

45:56.102 --> 45:57.401
Who's your source?

45:57.403 --> 45:59.537
The dumpster,

45:59.539 --> 46:02.240
at the back
of the NLDC building.

46:02.242 --> 46:03.506
You're joking, right?

46:03.508 --> 46:04.975
- No, I'm not.
- You're not joking?

46:04.977 --> 46:06.310
No. Who cares
where I got it, man?

46:06.312 --> 46:08.111
You're at the paper.
Can you print it or not?

46:08.113 --> 46:09.513
- I don't know.
- What do you mean,

46:09.515 --> 46:11.249
- you don't know?
- Seriously, I don't know.

46:11.251 --> 46:13.086
- This what you do!
- Billy.

46:14.519 --> 46:16.153
Look, Billy, there's another way

46:16.155 --> 46:17.988
to handle this.

46:17.990 --> 46:19.290
We can ask the NLDC

46:19.292 --> 46:20.457
to show us the documents.

46:20.459 --> 46:22.093
Right. Yeah.
Like that's gonna happen.

46:22.095 --> 46:22.961
Exactly.

46:22.963 --> 46:24.495
At which point,
we'll file a complaint

46:24.497 --> 46:25.897
for not being compliant

46:25.899 --> 46:29.332
with the Freedom
of Information Act.

46:29.334 --> 46:32.338
Yeah, that'll be a fun headline
for the Governor.

47:07.506 --> 47:10.174
Get me Charlotte.

47:10.176 --> 47:12.475
<i>We are getting
hammered in the press.</i>

47:12.477 --> 47:13.544
<i>In addition to your plan</i>

47:13.546 --> 47:15.212
<i>to demolish the homes,</i>

47:15.214 --> 47:17.147
<i>you violate the Freedom
of Information act?</i>

47:17.149 --> 47:20.051
The NLDC is
a private corporation.

47:20.053 --> 47:20.919
Bullshit!

47:20.921 --> 47:22.386
You could have shown them
something!

47:22.388 --> 47:24.154
All right, Mr. Governor,

47:24.156 --> 47:25.323
I think this little bump

47:25.325 --> 47:27.390
in the road is far better

47:27.392 --> 47:28.558
than had I shown them

47:28.560 --> 47:30.160
even one document.

47:30.162 --> 47:31.227
<i>Mm-hm.</i>

47:31.229 --> 47:33.663
<i>Now, if you remember,</i>

47:33.665 --> 47:36.232
<i>I told you
from the very beginning</i>

47:36.234 --> 47:38.301
<i>that this was going
to be an uphill battle,</i>

47:38.303 --> 47:40.470
and...

47:40.472 --> 47:42.640
if I may toot my own horn,

47:42.642 --> 47:46.609
I have come in on time
and on budget.

47:46.611 --> 47:48.412
I am not authorizing
another dime

47:48.414 --> 47:50.281
until you clean up
this PR shitstorm.

48:12.571 --> 48:14.307
Oh, my God.

48:20.446 --> 48:21.415
Oh, my God.

48:22.314 --> 48:24.515
Excuse me.

48:24.517 --> 48:26.383
Are you the owner
of this house?

48:26.385 --> 48:28.451
I live there. Yeah.

48:28.453 --> 48:30.388
- What happened?
- There was a fire.

48:30.390 --> 48:31.589
I'm not quite sure
of the cause.

48:31.591 --> 48:33.624
Yeah. Is everything okay?

48:33.626 --> 48:35.292
- Are the people all right?
- They're fine.

48:35.294 --> 48:36.593
They're in Family Services.
They're fine.

48:36.595 --> 48:38.796
Okay. And my house?
Can I go in, or...

48:38.798 --> 48:40.064
<i>You can, but
we had to soak it down</i>

48:40.066 --> 48:41.464
<i>to protect it from the fire,</i>

48:41.466 --> 48:42.732
<i>but there could be
some water damage,</i>

48:42.734 --> 48:44.468
- or smoke damage.
- Okay. Thank you.

48:44.470 --> 48:45.535
Okay. All right.

48:56.816 --> 48:59.049
<i>Well, that's one
way to get rid of her.</i>

49:34.220 --> 49:36.453
This is unbelievable.

49:36.455 --> 49:37.624
Damn it!

49:40.526 --> 49:42.392
Okay.

49:42.394 --> 49:44.563
All right, everybody,
here's the deal.

49:46.198 --> 49:48.466
The NLDC...

49:48.468 --> 49:50.366
has gotten permits to demolish

49:50.368 --> 49:53.136
five buildings in Fort Trumbull,

49:53.138 --> 49:54.471
<i>including the house
right next door</i>

49:54.473 --> 49:55.642
<i>to this one.</i>

49:57.176 --> 49:59.410
- So, we need a lawyer.
- I think so.

49:59.412 --> 50:00.711
You need ten lawyers.

50:00.713 --> 50:02.178
What are you talking
about "a" lawyer?

50:02.180 --> 50:03.446
I deal with this
kind of stuff.

50:03.448 --> 50:04.515
I have in the past.

50:04.517 --> 50:05.549
<i>It is a pain in the ass.</i>

50:05.551 --> 50:07.283
Business that great
over at the antique store?

50:07.285 --> 50:08.785
What are you suggesting?
You, like... I mean,

50:08.787 --> 50:10.854
you could always sell
your Jag, Billy.

50:10.856 --> 50:12.823
- I mean...
- No, I'd sell the Jag.

50:12.825 --> 50:14.457
- I'd sell the Jag.
- I'd sell it, but I'm telling you we need more money...

50:14.459 --> 50:15.558
- What else you gonna chip in?
- Guys.

50:15.560 --> 50:17.394
Guys.

50:17.396 --> 50:18.696
I think I can get a guy

50:18.698 --> 50:20.466
who'll take the case for free.

50:23.301 --> 50:24.336
Is he any good?

50:28.140 --> 50:30.841
No, the hearing
isn't until February.

50:30.843 --> 50:32.776
Yeah.

50:32.778 --> 50:34.410
No, no, I've been here
15 minutes.

50:34.412 --> 50:36.215
I'm circling.
I don't know where I am.

50:40.419 --> 50:42.386
East, East, East...

50:42.388 --> 50:45.092
<i>Hey, hey, Chip, I gotta call
you right back, okay?</i>

50:51.897 --> 50:54.598
Eating, talking
on your cell phone,

50:54.600 --> 50:55.765
looking on a map.

50:55.767 --> 50:58.269
It appears that driving
made it last

50:58.271 --> 51:00.337
on your to-do list.

51:00.339 --> 51:02.705
What brings you to New London,
Mr. Bullock?

51:02.707 --> 51:04.274
I'm on my way
to Susette Kelo's house.

51:04.276 --> 51:05.709
I'm with the Institute
for Justice.

51:05.711 --> 51:08.479
What's the Institute
for Justice?

51:08.481 --> 51:10.316
We're a non-profit law firm.

51:11.684 --> 51:14.317
Are you here to help
the Fort Trumbull folks?

51:14.319 --> 51:15.321
I am.

51:17.423 --> 51:19.522
My Aunt lives
in Fort Trumbull.

51:19.524 --> 51:20.658
<i>You go get 'em, Mr. Bullock.</i>

51:20.660 --> 51:21.725
Two blocks down.

51:21.727 --> 51:23.194
On the right.

51:23.196 --> 51:24.528
Okay. Thank you.

51:24.530 --> 51:25.595
I really appreciate it.

51:42.981 --> 51:44.684
This is blight?

51:48.386 --> 51:49.720
<i>Huh.</i>

51:49.722 --> 51:50.890
<i>Okay.</i>

51:55.995 --> 51:58.361
So, Scott, so glad you could
come down here to help us.

51:58.363 --> 52:00.497
- Yeah, of course.
- I think this is gonna be right up your street.

52:00.499 --> 52:02.499
Can I get anybody
anything else?

52:02.501 --> 52:04.370
- No, no, we're good.
- No, we're good to go.

52:05.972 --> 52:08.671
Okay, so I'd just like to start

52:08.673 --> 52:09.872
with asking you all
a few questions.

52:09.874 --> 52:12.575
How long have you been
a lawyer?

52:12.577 --> 52:13.644
Nine years.

52:13.646 --> 52:15.546
Why do you ask?

52:15.548 --> 52:17.484
I just wondered
if it was long enough.

52:18.584 --> 52:20.817
For... for what?

52:20.819 --> 52:23.354
To take this case?

52:23.356 --> 52:25.421
Yeah. I think so.

52:25.423 --> 52:27.424
Don't, don't worry about her.
She doesn't know any lawyers.

52:27.426 --> 52:29.259
<i>So I don't know any lawyers.</i>

52:29.261 --> 52:30.593
<i>Susette, I can assure you,</i>

52:30.595 --> 52:31.995
all of you,

52:31.997 --> 52:34.397
that Scott here comes
from a pedigree firm.

52:34.399 --> 52:36.533
<i>I think it's a great thing</i>

52:36.535 --> 52:37.868
that you're so young.

52:37.870 --> 52:40.270
You won't wear out as fast.

52:40.272 --> 52:41.638
That and I like
your bicycle out front.

52:43.843 --> 52:46.609
So, is that you? You're the
"Mayor of Jones Street"?

52:46.611 --> 52:47.977
Ah.

52:47.979 --> 52:50.480
No, this was
Frederick Colonardi's hat.

52:50.482 --> 52:52.750
- The man who passed away.
- Yeah. And I'll tell you,

52:52.752 --> 52:54.917
he's be looking down right now
and he's absolutely disgusted

52:54.919 --> 52:56.720
with what he sees.

52:56.722 --> 52:58.622
- With good reason.
- <i>Excuse me.</i>

52:58.624 --> 53:00.658
<i>Even though I have shirts
older than you...</i>

53:00.660 --> 53:01.792
<i>Gosh.</i>

53:01.794 --> 53:03.627
I was just wondering

53:03.629 --> 53:05.332
if you're gonna take our case.

53:06.999 --> 53:09.732
That's what I'm here
to find out.

53:31.823 --> 53:33.457
What was that?

54:20.705 --> 54:21.839
I simply want to know

54:21.841 --> 54:23.674
if it's on city council's agenda

54:23.676 --> 54:25.709
to vote on the demolition.

54:25.711 --> 54:27.144
You don't know.

54:27.146 --> 54:29.448
All right.
I'll keep checking.

54:33.017 --> 54:34.984
And finally, a vote to permit

54:34.986 --> 54:37.587
the Bunny Choir Players

54:37.589 --> 54:39.089
from New London Elementary

54:39.091 --> 54:41.758
to perform Christmas Carols
in the town center.

54:41.760 --> 54:43.127
All in favor say aye.

54:43.129 --> 54:45.899
- Aye.
- All right.

54:58.977 --> 55:01.611
One remaining issue.

55:01.613 --> 55:04.982
A vote for permits allowing
the NLDC to demolish

55:04.984 --> 55:06.582
at East and Trumbull.

55:06.584 --> 55:08.521
All in favor say Aye.

55:27.006 --> 55:28.604
They just tore
down Terry's house.

55:28.606 --> 55:29.939
- What?
- Yeah. Look. Excuse me.

55:29.941 --> 55:31.008
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

55:31.010 --> 55:32.442
Sir, we're with the NLDC...

55:32.444 --> 55:34.877
No, I know who you're with.

55:34.879 --> 55:36.779
- Oh, my God.
- <i>You don't have a permit</i>

55:36.781 --> 55:38.682
- <i>to do this!</i>
- The NLDC put the paperwork

55:38.684 --> 55:41.118
- in last night.
- No. That's bullshit!

55:41.120 --> 55:42.618
I was just at City Council
last night.

55:42.620 --> 55:44.888
I got this.
Go get my knitting.

55:44.890 --> 55:46.589
- What?
- Get my knitting.

55:46.591 --> 55:47.790
Oh, jeez.

55:47.792 --> 55:49.593
- I'm just doing my job.
- You are unbelievable.

55:49.595 --> 55:51.093
- Let me see this.
- These are private documents.

55:51.095 --> 55:52.763
- This is such bullshit.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

55:52.765 --> 55:54.464
Ma'am, you can't do that.

55:54.466 --> 55:56.667
- I'm going.
- Be my guest, Ms. Kelo.

55:56.669 --> 55:57.767
- She's right. Stop.
- You are not sitting

55:57.769 --> 55:59.035
- on the steps.
- I am. Billy!

55:59.037 --> 56:00.571
No, you're not,
if you want Bullock

56:00.573 --> 56:03.105
to take the case
we gotta to do it his way.

56:03.107 --> 56:05.075
Red, we have to do it his way.

56:05.077 --> 56:07.578
- Susette.
- Okay. Okay.

56:07.580 --> 56:09.580
All right. Okay.

56:09.582 --> 56:11.818
- Billy, let me...
- Yeah. Police, please.

56:22.760 --> 56:23.961
Well, here they come.

56:23.963 --> 56:25.698
You know the drill.

56:28.066 --> 56:29.468
Oh, for God...

56:31.035 --> 56:32.669
Well, you might as well
arrest us

56:32.671 --> 56:34.073
'cause we're not moving.

56:37.810 --> 56:40.711
Mayor Beachy,
please come with us.

56:40.713 --> 56:43.783
Sam, you know we're not
leaving voluntarily.

56:54.225 --> 56:55.928
Unbelievable!

56:57.963 --> 57:00.062
This is wrong, you know.

57:00.064 --> 57:02.031
What if this was your house?

57:02.033 --> 57:03.299
You should be ashamed
of yourselves.

57:03.301 --> 57:04.870
How do you sleep at night?

57:27.825 --> 57:30.095
All right, let's move
these people out of the way.

57:32.031 --> 57:33.733
Start it up.

57:37.937 --> 57:40.203
No, no, no.

57:40.205 --> 57:41.971
- How can they do that?
- I don't know.

57:49.013 --> 57:50.881
<i>Oh, God!</i>

57:50.883 --> 57:53.783
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

58:14.372 --> 58:17.073
This is somebody's home!

58:19.711 --> 58:20.843
To hell with you.

58:26.986 --> 58:29.285
<i>Oh, God! My house!</i>

58:29.287 --> 58:31.921
Please, just my house.
It's right here.

58:31.923 --> 58:33.957
Let me just go inside
and get the...

58:43.202 --> 58:45.004
Get it off my porch.

58:49.374 --> 58:51.174
<i>Susette.</i>

58:51.176 --> 58:52.642
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

58:52.644 --> 58:54.011
<i>Hey! Hey, hey!</i>

58:54.013 --> 58:55.745
Hey! Hey!

58:55.747 --> 58:57.948
Cut it, man.
She's on her porch!

58:57.950 --> 58:59.015
Cut it!

58:59.017 --> 59:01.051
Cut the goddamn engine!

59:01.053 --> 59:03.185
You see her standing
right there!

59:03.187 --> 59:05.124
<i>Don't you see that?</i>

59:28.046 --> 59:29.779
Oh, no.

59:29.781 --> 59:31.247
Susette, come on down
from there.

59:31.249 --> 59:32.783
<i>No.</i>

01:00:04.149 --> 01:00:06.716
<i>It was a cock show to
illustrate the inevitability.</i>

01:00:06.718 --> 01:00:08.384
To say, "This is a done deal.
You can't stop it".

01:00:08.386 --> 01:00:10.486
Legally, the city did own
those homes, Scott.

01:00:10.488 --> 01:00:11.988
They had the right
to tear them down.

01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:13.156
Yeah, but they didn't have to.

01:00:13.158 --> 01:00:14.124
They did it to intimidate
Susette.

01:00:14.126 --> 01:00:15.758
To let her know she's next.

01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:17.763
I could get every reporter
in America on this.

01:00:19.097 --> 01:00:22.131
We need to take
these people on.

01:00:22.133 --> 01:00:23.101
He's right.

01:00:29.073 --> 01:00:30.473
We're gonna take your case.

01:00:30.475 --> 01:00:32.075
<i>And you won't have
to pay us a fee.</i>

01:00:32.077 --> 01:00:33.910
Good, because, you know,

01:00:33.912 --> 01:00:35.345
we don't have any money.

01:00:35.347 --> 01:00:40.049
But we do need something
of you in return.

01:00:40.051 --> 01:00:43.086
What's that?

01:00:43.088 --> 01:00:45.154
I.J. wants this story covered

01:00:45.156 --> 01:00:47.290
by every major media outlet.

01:00:47.292 --> 01:00:50.060
We want full public exposure.

01:00:50.062 --> 01:00:51.428
That means talk shows,
newspapers,

01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:53.062
magazine interviews...

01:00:53.064 --> 01:00:55.999
We need you to be the face
of this fight.

01:00:56.001 --> 01:00:58.167
Me?

01:00:58.169 --> 01:00:59.468
Oh, I don't... no.

01:00:59.470 --> 01:01:01.303
I don't want to be the face
of anything.

01:01:01.305 --> 01:01:02.973
Make Billy do it.

01:01:02.975 --> 01:01:04.107
I don't think
that's a good idea.

01:01:04.109 --> 01:01:06.509
- No offense.
- None taken.

01:01:06.511 --> 01:01:08.044
Susette, it's got to be you.

01:01:08.046 --> 01:01:09.312
Why?

01:01:09.314 --> 01:01:11.080
Why does it have to be me?
I mean...

01:01:11.082 --> 01:01:14.116
- <i>I...</i>
- <i>Because it's your house.</i>

01:01:14.118 --> 01:01:16.486
Because you have more strength

01:01:16.488 --> 01:01:19.325
and resilience
than any woman I know.

01:01:21.193 --> 01:01:23.093
Plus, you're hot.

01:01:24.062 --> 01:01:25.127
Smoking hot.

01:01:27.365 --> 01:01:29.034
No. I, it's...

01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:43.412
Okay. I'll do it.

01:01:43.414 --> 01:01:45.281
- Yeah?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

01:01:45.283 --> 01:01:46.818
Then we're in.

01:01:49.021 --> 01:01:50.486
Okay. Thank you.

01:01:50.488 --> 01:01:52.354
<i>Evening, everyone.</i>

01:01:52.356 --> 01:01:53.890
Interesting way
to champion the cause

01:01:53.892 --> 01:01:58.395
of "social justice,"
Charlotte.

01:01:58.397 --> 01:02:01.163
This Institute for Justice,

01:02:01.165 --> 01:02:02.866
do we need to be concerned?

01:02:02.868 --> 01:02:04.267
Well, thanks to their lawsuit,

01:02:04.269 --> 01:02:06.870
I've got reporters
crawling up my ass

01:02:06.872 --> 01:02:09.104
every time I set foot
outside my own house.

01:02:09.106 --> 01:02:10.173
Well, what are they asking?

01:02:10.175 --> 01:02:11.875
They're wanting to know
why the city

01:02:11.877 --> 01:02:14.276
is trying to throw people
out of their homes.

01:02:14.278 --> 01:02:15.312
And when the city's attorney

01:02:15.314 --> 01:02:16.879
can't answer that question,

01:02:16.881 --> 01:02:18.314
there tends to be some
cause for concern.

01:02:18.316 --> 01:02:19.381
What are we looking at?

01:02:19.383 --> 01:02:22.285
I.J. filed a restraining order.

01:02:22.287 --> 01:02:24.187
It'll do some short-term damage

01:02:24.189 --> 01:02:25.087
in the court of public opinion,

01:02:25.089 --> 01:02:28.225
but, technically,
you own those homes,

01:02:28.227 --> 01:02:29.859
so you're in the clear.

01:02:29.861 --> 01:02:32.127
Any judge will lift the RO.

01:02:32.129 --> 01:02:33.865
Excellent.

01:02:35.968 --> 01:02:40.303
So Father, we now commend
Agnes to you in your hands.

01:02:40.305 --> 01:02:42.207
Hang in there, okay?

01:02:43.508 --> 01:02:46.212
- See you there.
- Okay. Yeah.

01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:52.214
Mom was so scared.

01:02:52.216 --> 01:02:54.017
She kept worrying

01:02:54.019 --> 01:02:56.019
that they were gonna
kick her out.

01:02:56.021 --> 01:02:58.254
Yeah.

01:02:58.256 --> 01:02:59.522
Well, at least she got to die

01:02:59.524 --> 01:03:01.327
in her own home, huh?

01:03:05.464 --> 01:03:07.834
And now I'm gonna lose
that too.

01:03:13.205 --> 01:03:15.272
It's fine.

01:03:15.274 --> 01:03:18.077
- I'll see you later, okay?
- Okay. Okay.

01:03:40.499 --> 01:03:43.633
Hold my calls.

01:03:43.635 --> 01:03:45.470
I'm so sorry I'm late.

01:03:47.305 --> 01:03:48.638
There are allegations

01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:50.973
that the amount of time
you've put into the NLDC

01:03:50.975 --> 01:03:53.209
has lead to financial distress

01:03:53.211 --> 01:03:54.343
at Walthrop College.

01:03:54.345 --> 01:03:56.178
- Is this true?
- No.

01:03:56.180 --> 01:03:59.214
No, a lot of people
want to attack a woman

01:03:59.216 --> 01:04:01.651
for trying to do it all.

01:04:01.653 --> 01:04:04.321
I'm not concerned
about Walthrop.

01:04:04.323 --> 01:04:05.555
These are just critics.

01:04:05.557 --> 01:04:08.325
Getting back to Fort Trumbull,
Mrs. Colonardi, the widow...

01:04:08.327 --> 01:04:11.328
- We told her she could stay.
- She can?

01:04:11.330 --> 01:04:12.294
Yeah, we wouldn't need her house

01:04:12.296 --> 01:04:14.199
until after she dies, so...

01:04:16.133 --> 01:04:17.466
Next question.

01:04:17.468 --> 01:04:19.169
<i>Our top story tonight.</i>

01:04:19.171 --> 01:04:20.169
Residents of the historic

01:04:20.171 --> 01:04:21.638
Fort Trumbull area
of New London

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:23.573
are fighting to save
their homes.

01:04:23.575 --> 01:04:25.075
<i>On Monday they'll head to Court</i>

01:04:25.077 --> 01:04:27.076
<i>to resolve
their dispute over land</i>

01:04:27.078 --> 01:04:28.611
<i>proposed for the multimillion</i>

01:04:28.613 --> 01:04:30.046
<i>dollar redevelopment</i>

01:04:30.048 --> 01:04:31.314
<i>of the waterfront neighborhood.</i>

01:04:31.316 --> 01:04:32.749
<i>Let me tell you something</i>

01:04:32.751 --> 01:04:35.484
<i>that should put you
instantly at ease</i>

01:04:35.486 --> 01:04:38.187
<i>in an interview.</i>

01:04:38.189 --> 01:04:39.723
You're already the world's

01:04:39.725 --> 01:04:43.392
greatest expert on your story.

01:04:43.394 --> 01:04:44.259
You've lived it.

01:04:44.261 --> 01:04:45.597
You know it.

01:04:47.098 --> 01:04:48.430
All you have to do

01:04:48.432 --> 01:04:49.566
is tell the truth

01:04:49.568 --> 01:04:52.368
about what you've
experienced here.

01:04:52.370 --> 01:04:54.270
<i>What you're doing is right.</i>

01:04:54.272 --> 01:04:57.374
<i>What they're doing, it's wrong.</i>

01:04:57.376 --> 01:04:59.274
<i>Oh, sure, sometimes reporters</i>

01:04:59.276 --> 01:05:00.542
<i>they'll ask you questions</i>

01:05:00.544 --> 01:05:02.379
<i>you might not know
the answer to.</i>

01:05:02.381 --> 01:05:04.346
<i>It might be a question
about the law</i>

01:05:04.348 --> 01:05:06.383
<i>or the Constitution.</i>

01:05:06.385 --> 01:05:08.350
<i>Just be honest and say,
"You know what?</i>

01:05:08.352 --> 01:05:11.421
<i>I don't know the answer
to that, but...</i>

01:05:11.423 --> 01:05:14.126
<i>let me tell you
about this home.</i>

01:05:15.394 --> 01:05:17.160
<i>And what it means to me...</i>

01:05:17.162 --> 01:05:20.229
- Thank you.
- <i>...and my family."</i>

01:05:20.231 --> 01:05:21.598
<i>That's it.</i>

01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:24.466
<i>It isn't any more complicated
than that.</i>

01:05:24.468 --> 01:05:27.169
<i>So...</i>

01:05:27.171 --> 01:05:30.709
are you the world's greatest
expert on your story?

01:05:35.479 --> 01:05:37.148
<i>Then tell your story.</i>

01:05:38.482 --> 01:05:40.316
Hands off our homes!

01:05:40.318 --> 01:05:42.317
Hands off our homes!

01:05:42.319 --> 01:05:44.386
Hands off our homes!

01:05:44.388 --> 01:05:46.256
Hands off our homes!

01:05:46.258 --> 01:05:48.290
Hands off our homes!

01:05:53.365 --> 01:05:55.497
I don't...

01:05:55.499 --> 01:05:56.635
You can do this.

01:05:58.569 --> 01:05:59.669
Let's just get this over with.

01:05:59.671 --> 01:06:01.504
Hands off our homes!

01:06:01.506 --> 01:06:03.540
- Hands off our homes!
- All right?

01:06:03.542 --> 01:06:05.475
Hands off our homes!

01:06:05.477 --> 01:06:06.743
Hands off our homes!

01:06:06.745 --> 01:06:08.211
Hands off our homes!

01:06:08.213 --> 01:06:09.479
Yes, go.

01:06:09.481 --> 01:06:10.613
Hands off our homes!

01:06:25.464 --> 01:06:27.400
Hello.
Hi. Good morning.

01:06:29.133 --> 01:06:32.201
- My name's Susette Kelo.
- Yeah, we know!

01:06:36.675 --> 01:06:40.343
We look forward
to presenting our case today.

01:06:40.345 --> 01:06:43.812
We've waited
a long time for this.

01:06:43.814 --> 01:06:46.649
And we look forward to having
our day in court.

01:06:46.651 --> 01:06:48.383
Thank you.

01:06:48.385 --> 01:06:50.153
Ms. Kelo, do you truly believe

01:06:50.155 --> 01:06:52.557
that the city's in violation
of the Constitution?

01:06:57.495 --> 01:06:58.664
I...

01:06:59.830 --> 01:07:01.430
I...

01:07:01.432 --> 01:07:03.433
I just know...

01:07:03.435 --> 01:07:05.535
that we should be able
to keep our homes.

01:07:08.173 --> 01:07:10.540
No, and then,
one more thing,

01:07:10.542 --> 01:07:12.441
and that...

01:07:12.443 --> 01:07:14.611
what they're doing is wrong.

01:07:18.283 --> 01:07:19.318
That's it.

01:07:23.588 --> 01:07:25.587
I guess some lawyers
file their papers

01:07:25.589 --> 01:07:27.390
with the media first,

01:07:27.392 --> 01:07:28.924
then the court.

01:07:28.926 --> 01:07:30.426
<i>Mr. Bullock.</i>

01:07:30.428 --> 01:07:32.462
<i>You may proceed, sir.</i>

01:07:32.464 --> 01:07:35.397
Your Honor.
Government can,

01:07:35.399 --> 01:07:37.533
through the power
of eminent domain,

01:07:37.535 --> 01:07:39.569
lawfully seize private property

01:07:39.571 --> 01:07:41.571
for public use

01:07:41.573 --> 01:07:43.238
to build hospitals,

01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:44.607
highways,

01:07:44.609 --> 01:07:45.774
<i>dams.</i>

01:07:45.776 --> 01:07:47.544
But in this case,

01:07:47.546 --> 01:07:49.546
the government
has misused its power

01:07:49.548 --> 01:07:52.448
to enrich private parties,

01:07:52.450 --> 01:07:55.919
namely Pfizer Pharmaceutical.

01:07:55.921 --> 01:07:57.921
<i>Your Honor, simply stated,</i>

01:07:57.923 --> 01:08:01.890
the City of New London
followed state statutes.

01:08:01.892 --> 01:08:04.660
I would also like
to point out that the NLDC

01:08:04.662 --> 01:08:07.629
has spent 73 million dollars

01:08:07.631 --> 01:08:09.598
<i>upgrading roads,</i>

01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:11.935
<i>sewers,
street lights,</i>

01:08:11.937 --> 01:08:13.569
<i>all of which has resulted</i>

01:08:13.571 --> 01:08:15.571
in public benefit.

01:08:15.573 --> 01:08:18.542
<i>How did you learn eminent
domain was filed against you?</i>

01:08:23.314 --> 01:08:26.549
I came home
from work one day

01:08:26.551 --> 01:08:29.285
and a letter was taped

01:08:29.287 --> 01:08:30.652
to my front door.

01:08:30.654 --> 01:08:32.590
Was there anything
about an occupancy fee?

01:08:33.992 --> 01:08:36.526
You mean the eviction notice?

01:08:36.528 --> 01:08:39.595
<i>So you also received
an eviction notice?</i>

01:08:39.596 --> 01:08:41.229
Yes.

01:08:41.232 --> 01:08:42.532
Prior to that,

01:08:42.533 --> 01:08:43.836
was there anything
about a rental fee?

01:08:45.470 --> 01:08:46.437
Yes.

01:08:47.638 --> 01:08:49.639
They wanted me
to pay rent

01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:51.743
on the house that I own.

01:08:53.243 --> 01:08:56.312
What, if anything, Mrs.
Kelo,

01:08:56.314 --> 01:08:57.917
do you wanna get
out of this lawsuit?

01:08:59.684 --> 01:09:00.817
I just want
to be left in peace.

01:09:00.819 --> 01:09:03.321
I don't...
I wanna come home and...

01:09:04.622 --> 01:09:06.354
relax, finally,

01:09:06.357 --> 01:09:08.426
and be left alone.

01:09:11.296 --> 01:09:13.595
<i>Which is why</i>

01:09:13.596 --> 01:09:15.697
it is so important

01:09:15.698 --> 01:09:17.966
for us to integrate

01:09:17.968 --> 01:09:19.501
the infrastructure

01:09:19.502 --> 01:09:20.902
of large corporations

01:09:20.904 --> 01:09:23.604
to the brass tacks needs

01:09:23.607 --> 01:09:27.710
- <i>of our city's most needful...</i>
- Okay, okay, okay.

01:09:27.712 --> 01:09:29.679
Mrs. Wells,
let's see something new.

01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:33.349
- Oh.
- <i>Realizing that life is short,</i>

01:09:33.350 --> 01:09:35.318
when someone
asks you a "yes"

01:09:35.319 --> 01:09:37.754
or "no" question,
how about you answer

01:09:37.756 --> 01:09:40.555
with a "yes" or "no"?

01:09:40.557 --> 01:09:42.392
<i>Counsel.</i>

01:09:42.394 --> 01:09:43.962
<i>So, was the
answer to my question...</i>

01:09:45.930 --> 01:09:46.899
yes?

01:09:49.966 --> 01:09:50.935
Yes.

01:09:51.836 --> 01:09:53.769
I said yes.

01:09:53.770 --> 01:09:56.738
I said it at the end
instead of the beginning.

01:09:56.740 --> 01:09:58.707
That's the way the French
frame their answers,

01:09:58.709 --> 01:10:00.076
so I'm sorry
and I will try

01:10:00.078 --> 01:10:01.981
to think more Anglo-American.

01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:17.926
<i>Billy, you're gonna wear a hole</i>

01:10:17.928 --> 01:10:19.394
- <i>in the carpet.</i>
- I'm good.

01:10:21.365 --> 01:10:22.564
Bull?

01:10:22.566 --> 01:10:23.666
Let me put you on speaker.

01:10:23.668 --> 01:10:25.835
Okay.
Are you there?

01:10:25.837 --> 01:10:27.069
- <i>Mm-hm.</i>
- We're all here, buddy.

01:10:27.071 --> 01:10:28.638
- Bull. Tim here.
- Billy here.

01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:30.907
<i>All right.</i>

01:10:30.909 --> 01:10:32.642
<i>You, Billy,
and the Vecchiarellis</i>

01:10:32.644 --> 01:10:33.776
<i>get to keep your properties.</i>

01:10:33.778 --> 01:10:36.379
Oh, my God.

01:10:36.381 --> 01:10:38.715
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, yes.

01:10:38.717 --> 01:10:42.050
What, what?
What, what, what?

01:10:42.052 --> 01:10:44.620
- What else, brother?
- <i>The rest isn't good.</i>

01:10:44.622 --> 01:10:46.755
<i>See, the judge split the baby.</i>

01:10:46.757 --> 01:10:49.492
- What does that mean?
- <i>Developers won't build anything</i>

01:10:49.494 --> 01:10:51.993
<i>on your land,
but they might build something</i>

01:10:51.995 --> 01:10:53.729
- <i>on theirs.</i>
- What?

01:10:53.731 --> 01:10:55.630
How does that work?

01:10:55.632 --> 01:10:57.066
How would that work?

01:10:57.068 --> 01:10:59.768
<i>Listen, you guys.
Go get a drink.</i>

01:10:59.770 --> 01:11:01.703
<i>Celebrate a little.
You deserve it.</i>

01:11:01.705 --> 01:11:03.706
- <i>Okay? We'll talk tomorrow.</i>
- Okay. Thank you, brother.

01:11:03.708 --> 01:11:05.041
Thank you very much.
We're going for a drink.

01:11:05.043 --> 01:11:06.408
Come on.
Let's hit the bar.

01:11:06.410 --> 01:11:07.676
Let's do that.
Let's celebrate.

01:11:07.678 --> 01:11:09.679
- Let's get out of here!
- Let's go.

01:11:09.681 --> 01:11:11.613
We're getting drunk.

01:11:11.615 --> 01:11:12.717
Come on.

01:11:13.752 --> 01:11:15.385
Okay, let me just get my...

01:11:15.387 --> 01:11:16.919
let me get my wallet
and stuff.

01:11:16.921 --> 01:11:18.755
No, I got money.

01:11:18.757 --> 01:11:19.758
I've got money.

01:11:27.798 --> 01:11:29.165
So what do we do now?

01:11:31.836 --> 01:11:33.806
This one's above my pay grade.

01:11:38.842 --> 01:11:41.077
Basically, they're saying that
if nobody appeals the decision,

01:11:41.079 --> 01:11:42.879
they won't appeal either.

01:11:42.881 --> 01:11:45.415
<i>I don't trust a damn
thing they say anyway.</i>

01:11:45.417 --> 01:11:46.782
They're trying to pit us
against each other.

01:11:46.784 --> 01:11:48.584
I can't even believe
they can do this.

01:11:48.586 --> 01:11:50.920
We get to keep our homes

01:11:50.922 --> 01:11:52.091
and they gotta take it.

01:11:55.827 --> 01:11:56.861
Fuck 'em.

01:11:57.762 --> 01:11:59.961
Either all of us stay,

01:11:59.963 --> 01:12:01.730
- or all of us go.
- <i>Yup.</i>

01:12:01.732 --> 01:12:03.499
<i>I mean, what's
the point, right?</i>

01:12:03.501 --> 01:12:04.834
I got a deli
with nobody in it?

01:12:04.836 --> 01:12:06.001
Hey, how's the new thing?

01:12:06.003 --> 01:12:07.670
Oh, since Pfizer moved in,
it's great.

01:12:07.672 --> 01:12:09.138
I got no neighbors,
but I got this raging boner

01:12:09.140 --> 01:12:11.206
all the time.
Who needs that?

01:12:11.208 --> 01:12:12.810
<i>Yeah.
We fight 'em.</i>

01:12:17.047 --> 01:12:18.649
Here.

01:12:19.751 --> 01:12:21.019
Thanks, sweetie.

01:12:37.802 --> 01:12:38.937
I'm scared.

01:12:44.876 --> 01:12:46.412
I got your back.

01:12:47.512 --> 01:12:48.614
I know.

01:12:49.747 --> 01:12:50.982
Thank you.

01:12:52.516 --> 01:12:53.651
Thank you.

01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:56.821
No, I mean it.
Thank you.

01:12:58.722 --> 01:13:00.188
First thing tomorrow,
we're gonna file an appeal

01:13:00.190 --> 01:13:02.023
so the Kelo, Von Winkle,
and Vecchiarelli properties

01:13:02.025 --> 01:13:04.160
- go back to the NDLC.
- This is ludicrous.

01:13:04.162 --> 01:13:05.862
Everybody's talking about it.

01:13:05.864 --> 01:13:08.029
Just yesterday,
my 11-year-old granddaughter,

01:13:08.031 --> 01:13:09.932
she asks me why
it's okay for the city

01:13:09.934 --> 01:13:11.867
to steal people's homes.

01:13:11.869 --> 01:13:13.536
My own granddaughter.

01:13:13.538 --> 01:13:16.171
They grow up fast nowadays.

01:13:16.173 --> 01:13:17.840
Okay.

01:13:17.842 --> 01:13:19.975
What's next?

01:13:19.977 --> 01:13:21.943
We need to block I.J.'s move

01:13:21.945 --> 01:13:23.582
to overturn the ruling.

01:13:25.883 --> 01:13:26.918
Got it.

01:13:33.290 --> 01:13:35.590
No, I don't care
what he's doing.

01:13:35.592 --> 01:13:37.760
I need to speak with him.
Now.

01:13:37.762 --> 01:13:40.897
<i>And will he know what
it's regarding, Mrs. Wells?</i>

01:13:40.899 --> 01:13:42.732
Yes, he knows exactly

01:13:42.734 --> 01:13:44.533
what this is regarding.

01:13:44.535 --> 01:13:46.102
<i>Charlotte Wells for you...</i>

01:13:46.104 --> 01:13:47.506
<i>...again.</i>

01:13:52.709 --> 01:13:53.975
Hello, Charlotte.

01:13:53.977 --> 01:13:56.978
I got a call
from one of your lackies.

01:13:56.980 --> 01:13:59.247
You didn't have the balls
to fire me yourself.

01:13:59.249 --> 01:14:01.250
- Now hold on.
- No, you hold on.

01:14:01.252 --> 01:14:03.118
You hired me to turn
this city around

01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:04.886
and I did exactly that.

01:14:04.888 --> 01:14:06.755
And now you're throwing me out?

01:14:06.757 --> 01:14:08.092
You've become a liability.

01:14:17.001 --> 01:14:19.602
A fucking liability?!

01:14:19.604 --> 01:14:21.269
Charlotte, the only thing
that both sides can agree on

01:14:21.271 --> 01:14:24.105
is how much they despise you.
You're out of control.

01:14:24.107 --> 01:14:25.707
<i>You don't seem to care
who you step on</i>

01:14:25.709 --> 01:14:26.908
<i>or who sees you do it.</i>

01:14:26.910 --> 01:14:28.643
Yeah.
I do what is necessary.

01:14:28.645 --> 01:14:30.880
If I haven't left
some blood on the battlefield,

01:14:30.882 --> 01:14:32.648
I haven't done enough.

01:14:32.650 --> 01:14:34.916
You clearly don't understand
the power of perception.

01:14:34.918 --> 01:14:37.687
Oh, I do.

01:14:37.689 --> 01:14:39.822
<i>What about the perception
of the governor</i>

01:14:39.824 --> 01:14:42.825
who's trying to avoid
more controversy

01:14:42.827 --> 01:14:43.858
because he's now the target

01:14:43.860 --> 01:14:45.961
of a corruption investigation?

01:14:45.963 --> 01:14:47.729
My legal issues have nothing
to do with this.

01:14:47.731 --> 01:14:49.734
They have everything
to do with this.

01:15:00.611 --> 01:15:02.644
This is where we part ways,
Charlotte.

01:15:02.646 --> 01:15:04.149
Thank you for everything
you've done.

01:15:07.685 --> 01:15:08.720
No.

01:15:30.341 --> 01:15:32.177
<i>Major head
trauma coming in.</i>

01:15:35.980 --> 01:15:37.880
- It was a car accident.
- Oh, my God.

01:15:37.882 --> 01:15:39.881
- <i>What? You know him?</i>
- Yes.

01:15:39.883 --> 01:15:41.884
- <i>Okay. Stay here, Susette.</i>
- No, no...

01:15:41.886 --> 01:15:42.952
<i>You can't come in.
You know you can't come in.</i>

01:15:42.954 --> 01:15:44.019
I know I can't come in!

01:15:44.021 --> 01:15:45.356
Oh, my God!

01:16:00.971 --> 01:16:02.871
Please.
Please.

01:16:02.873 --> 01:16:04.909
Please don't do this.

01:16:07.412 --> 01:16:08.847
<i>Susette.</i>

01:16:13.316 --> 01:16:16.018
So this is where we stand.

01:16:16.020 --> 01:16:18.853
<i>There was spinal fluid
in his nose and ears.</i>

01:16:18.855 --> 01:16:20.423
<i>There was free air
in his brain</i>

01:16:20.425 --> 01:16:22.758
<i>as a result
of the skull fracture.</i>

01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:24.059
<i>He will be permanently disabled</i>

01:16:24.061 --> 01:16:25.193
<i>both mentally and physically</i>

01:16:25.195 --> 01:16:26.929
<i>and he will need full-time care</i>

01:16:26.931 --> 01:16:29.331
<i>through his recovery.</i>

01:16:29.333 --> 01:16:32.100
Do you and your husband
have any support

01:16:32.102 --> 01:16:33.305
<i>through this process?</i>

01:16:35.138 --> 01:16:36.775
He's not my husband.

01:16:37.874 --> 01:16:38.941
Oh.

01:16:38.943 --> 01:16:40.745
I thought you were married.

01:17:21.052 --> 01:17:22.451
Are you asleep?

01:17:22.453 --> 01:17:24.053
<i>Okay, so here are the things</i>

01:17:24.055 --> 01:17:26.755
<i>that I wanted to say to you
that I couldn't.</i>

01:17:26.757 --> 01:17:29.157
I wrote them in a letter to you.

01:17:29.159 --> 01:17:31.262
I wish I had mailed it.

01:17:34.065 --> 01:17:36.831
On the arms right here.

01:17:36.833 --> 01:17:38.968
<i>I said, "Dear Tim,
I wish I could tell you</i>

01:17:38.970 --> 01:17:40.035
<i>how much I love you.</i>

01:17:40.037 --> 01:17:40.969
One...

01:17:40.971 --> 01:17:42.938
<i>"But I'm afraid
I'll need you too much</i>

01:17:42.940 --> 01:17:45.073
<i>and then one day</i>

01:17:45.075 --> 01:17:47.076
<i>you'll stop loving me back.</i>

01:17:47.078 --> 01:17:49.778
<i>The scariest part
is that I finally found</i>

01:17:49.780 --> 01:17:51.980
<i>the house of my dreams
and it means nothing to me</i>

01:17:51.982 --> 01:17:52.916
<i>without you in it."</i>

01:17:52.918 --> 01:17:54.282
<i>By the authority vested in me</i>

01:17:54.284 --> 01:17:57.018
by the laws of the state
of Connecticut,

01:17:57.020 --> 01:17:59.087
I now pronounce
you husband and wife.

01:18:17.574 --> 01:18:18.776
Here we go.

01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:24.116
This can't be possible.

01:18:27.251 --> 01:18:29.385
Property owners in
one New London neighborhood

01:18:29.387 --> 01:18:32.188
may be losing a long battle
to save their homes.

01:18:32.190 --> 01:18:33.956
<i>The State Supreme Court
has ruled</i>

01:18:33.958 --> 01:18:36.224
<i>that the New London
Development Corporation</i>

01:18:36.226 --> 01:18:38.493
<i>can take the remaining 15 homes</i>

01:18:38.495 --> 01:18:40.996
<i>from near
Fort Trumbull state park...</i>

01:18:40.998 --> 01:18:43.064
<i>Pack your bags and get out.</i>

01:18:43.066 --> 01:18:45.134
<i>That's what New London
is telling homeowners</i>

01:18:45.136 --> 01:18:47.135
<i>in the city's Fort Trumbull
neighborhood.</i>

01:18:47.137 --> 01:18:48.536
<i>The city wants to clear the way</i>

01:18:48.538 --> 01:18:50.939
<i>for a new Pfizer
corporate facility</i>

01:18:50.941 --> 01:18:54.309
<i>that would include luxury
condos and a hotel.</i>

01:18:54.311 --> 01:18:56.344
<i>And officials are using
eminent domain</i>

01:18:56.346 --> 01:18:58.447
<i>to take
the Fort Trumbull homes.</i>

01:18:58.449 --> 01:19:01.183
<i>The problem is the people
don't want to move.</i>

01:19:13.364 --> 01:19:14.566
It was too close.

01:19:17.133 --> 01:19:18.970
A four-three margin?

01:19:20.238 --> 01:19:22.270
There was clear dissent, okay?

01:19:22.272 --> 01:19:24.240
Look, it says it right here.

01:19:24.242 --> 01:19:25.108
"The court is going further

01:19:25.110 --> 01:19:27.910
than it has ever gone
in the past."

01:19:27.912 --> 01:19:31.313
It says this right
in the very first paragraph.

01:19:31.315 --> 01:19:33.115
- Oh, my God.
- What? What?

01:19:33.117 --> 01:19:35.251
You're actually considering it,
aren't you?

01:19:35.253 --> 01:19:37.652
The dissenting opinion makes
the exact points we need.

01:19:37.654 --> 01:19:39.487
<i>It's right there
in the opinion, Dana.</i>

01:19:39.489 --> 01:19:42.157
We're taking this appeal
to the U.S. Supreme Court.

01:19:42.159 --> 01:19:45.493
- We have to.
- They'll never take it.

01:19:45.495 --> 01:19:47.228
Chip, you're the boss.
It's your call.

01:19:47.230 --> 01:19:49.665
The Connecticut Supreme
Court reversed the good parts

01:19:49.667 --> 01:19:51.066
and affirmed the bad ones.

01:19:51.068 --> 01:19:53.137
We need to at least
take a shot.

01:19:57.607 --> 01:19:58.907
I guess I'd better
clear my schedule off

01:19:58.909 --> 01:20:01.143
- for the next year.
- Yes!

01:20:01.145 --> 01:20:02.310
- I'll bang out a press release.
- <i>Okay.</i>

01:20:02.312 --> 01:20:03.381
Let's get to work.

01:20:06.316 --> 01:20:08.216
But this is something
we should be concerned about.

01:20:08.218 --> 01:20:10.118
Jim, they have about
a one in a hundred chance

01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:12.254
of having this petition granted
by the U.S. Supreme Court.

01:20:12.256 --> 01:20:14.223
Look, Kelo's case
simply doesn't conflict

01:20:14.225 --> 01:20:16.558
with any existing decisions from
any other State Trial Court.

01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:18.359
So you're telling me
I can sleep at night.

01:20:18.361 --> 01:20:19.694
It's a pretty safe bet.

01:20:19.696 --> 01:20:21.663
Good.
This city needs to move on.

01:20:21.665 --> 01:20:23.232
I'll be in touch.

01:20:23.234 --> 01:20:24.366
Sounds good.

01:20:35.245 --> 01:20:37.015
You've gotta be kidding me.

01:20:39.115 --> 01:20:40.316
Bring Harrigan back.

01:20:40.318 --> 01:20:41.519
<i>Quick!</i>

01:20:46.056 --> 01:20:49.157
- Son of a bitch.
- Oh, and it gets worse.

01:20:49.159 --> 01:20:51.660
Michigan Supreme Court just
prevented the City of Detroit

01:20:51.662 --> 01:20:53.295
from bulldozing
a neighborhood in order

01:20:53.297 --> 01:20:54.395
to make room for guess who?

01:20:54.397 --> 01:20:56.598
- A private corporation.
- Kelo and company's chances

01:20:56.600 --> 01:20:57.666
of getting in front
of the Supremes

01:20:57.668 --> 01:20:59.335
just went up to 50-50.

01:20:59.337 --> 01:21:00.605
I guess so.

01:21:19.289 --> 01:21:21.290
- Hey, Bull.
- <i>You got a second?</i>

01:21:21.292 --> 01:21:24.225
- Yeah. Just.
- Susette,

01:21:24.227 --> 01:21:27.362
the U.S. Supreme Court
has agreed to hear your case.

01:21:27.364 --> 01:21:30.034
- <i>Are you shitting me?</i>
- No, I shit you not.

01:21:34.372 --> 01:21:37.272
Oh, my God.

01:21:37.274 --> 01:21:39.308
Oh, my God.

01:21:39.310 --> 01:21:41.443
<i>I don't know what to say.</i>

01:21:41.445 --> 01:21:43.277
<i>You think we might...</i>

01:21:43.279 --> 01:21:46.247
- <i>We might win this thing?</i>
- That's the plan.

01:21:49.787 --> 01:21:52.453
- Oh, Bull.
- <i>Don't worry. Don't worry.</i>

01:21:52.455 --> 01:21:54.689
<i>We're gonna... we're gonna do
the best that we can, okay?</i>

01:21:54.691 --> 01:21:56.325
<i>Okay?
We'll talk soon, okay?</i>

01:21:56.327 --> 01:21:57.494
Thank you.

01:22:06.169 --> 01:22:08.504
- Hey, Susette. Hi.
- Hi, April.

01:22:08.506 --> 01:22:10.671
- How's it going?
- <i>Crazy.</i>

01:22:10.673 --> 01:22:13.408
Some guy got wheeled
into the ER by his buddy...

01:22:13.410 --> 01:22:14.475
Uh-huh.

01:22:14.477 --> 01:22:16.077
...in a wheelbarrow.

01:22:16.079 --> 01:22:17.446
- Really?
- Really.

01:22:17.448 --> 01:22:20.448
- Amazing.
- Drunk, in his underwear,

01:22:20.450 --> 01:22:23.051
covered in blood
in a wheelbarrow.

01:22:23.053 --> 01:22:26.487
- Yeah, so, what else is new?
- Yeah, right?

01:22:26.489 --> 01:22:28.189
Yeah.

01:22:28.191 --> 01:22:30.158
The Supreme Court has agreed
to decide if governments

01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:32.126
can seize people's homes
and businesses

01:22:32.128 --> 01:22:34.328
for economic
development projects.

01:22:34.330 --> 01:22:35.496
Eminent domain is now the focus

01:22:35.498 --> 01:22:37.265
of a Supreme Court showdown.

01:22:37.267 --> 01:22:39.535
It's become a contentious issue
across the country.

01:22:39.537 --> 01:22:41.603
<i>So this means
if the Supreme Court</i>

01:22:41.605 --> 01:22:43.371
<i>does not side
with Susette Kelo,</i>

01:22:43.373 --> 01:22:46.442
<i>then no homeowner
of limited means is safe.</i>

01:22:46.444 --> 01:22:47.843
<i>Mr. Bratten,
I have another reporter</i>

01:22:47.845 --> 01:22:49.577
<i>on the line.</i>
Dallas Morning News.

01:22:49.579 --> 01:22:52.346
- Take a message.
- <i>It's the seventh time</i>

01:22:52.348 --> 01:22:54.084
<i>he's called, sir.</i>

01:22:56.352 --> 01:22:57.585
Fine.

01:22:57.587 --> 01:23:00.089
This is Bratten.

01:23:00.091 --> 01:23:01.622
<i>Mr. Bratten, Tony Keller</i>

01:23:01.624 --> 01:23:04.193
- <i>with the</i> Dallas Morning News.
- Yes.

01:23:04.195 --> 01:23:06.694
<i>I hear you're throwing
an 87-year-old woman</i>

01:23:06.696 --> 01:23:09.264
<i>out of her home.
Am I hearing that right?</i>

01:23:09.266 --> 01:23:10.335
<i>You really think that...</i>

01:23:27.517 --> 01:23:28.416
Now, we're obviously gonna need

01:23:28.418 --> 01:23:29.818
to address the majority...

01:23:29.820 --> 01:23:31.519
- <i>Scott?</i>
- Yeah.

01:23:31.521 --> 01:23:33.287
<i>Sorry to disturb you,
but Jim Bratten is here</i>

01:23:33.289 --> 01:23:35.456
<i>to see you.</i>

01:23:35.458 --> 01:23:38.527
He's here?
Physically here?

01:23:38.529 --> 01:23:39.631
<i>Yes.</i>

01:23:41.899 --> 01:23:44.198
We'll pick this up later.
Is that okay?

01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:45.302
Thank you.

01:23:47.471 --> 01:23:49.371
Okay. Send him in,
I guess.

01:23:49.373 --> 01:23:50.906
<i>He's actually
on his way right now.</i>

01:23:50.908 --> 01:23:53.575
I've been practicing law
for over 20 years, Mr. Bullock.

01:23:53.577 --> 01:23:55.577
I've met a lot of scum
on this planet,

01:23:55.579 --> 01:23:56.478
but none as dishonest

01:23:56.480 --> 01:23:59.180
- and manipulative as you.
- Excuse me?

01:23:59.182 --> 01:24:00.715
This is the most insulting trash

01:24:00.717 --> 01:24:03.318
anyone's ever said about me
in my entire career.

01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:04.920
You're joking.

01:24:04.922 --> 01:24:07.523
"The city's lawyers should hang
their heads in shame

01:24:07.525 --> 01:24:09.758
at what they're doing
to their citizens

01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:12.527
and to the Constitution
of the United States."

01:24:12.529 --> 01:24:14.162
Come on, Scott!

01:24:14.164 --> 01:24:15.531
You can continue this shit show

01:24:15.533 --> 01:24:16.865
for the entire world to see.

01:24:16.867 --> 01:24:18.567
I can't do anything about that.

01:24:18.569 --> 01:24:20.835
But what you're doing is wrong,
plain and simple.

01:24:20.837 --> 01:24:22.437
You're handing
people's homes over

01:24:22.439 --> 01:24:25.340
to a private corporation
and I'm the villain?

01:24:25.342 --> 01:24:26.875
The city is
taking the property.

01:24:26.877 --> 01:24:28.477
For Pfizer's benefit.

01:24:28.479 --> 01:24:30.245
Okay.
Let's just say you're right,

01:24:30.247 --> 01:24:31.612
which you're not.

01:24:31.614 --> 01:24:34.183
How is any city
supposed to grow

01:24:34.185 --> 01:24:36.617
if you're handcuffing leaders
with vision?

01:24:36.619 --> 01:24:38.554
This whole plan
is for the greater good.

01:24:38.556 --> 01:24:40.621
- Why can't you see that?
- Some of the worst acts

01:24:40.623 --> 01:24:42.291
in history were justified

01:24:42.293 --> 01:24:44.725
because they were in pursuit
of a "greater good".

01:24:44.727 --> 01:24:47.429
Some of the worst acts
in history?

01:24:47.431 --> 01:24:48.596
Wow.

01:24:48.598 --> 01:24:51.567
Why don't you try that line
before the Supreme Court?

01:24:51.569 --> 01:24:52.570
You flew here for that?

01:24:54.704 --> 01:24:55.906
Have a nice flight.

01:25:13.524 --> 01:25:16.528
The Honorable Justice
O'Connor presiding.

01:25:18.462 --> 01:25:19.694
We will now hear argument

01:25:19.696 --> 01:25:22.333
in the case of Kelo
v. New London.

01:25:26.604 --> 01:25:29.403
Justice O'Connor, and
may it please the Court.

01:25:29.405 --> 01:25:30.973
This case is about whether
there are any limits

01:25:30.975 --> 01:25:33.575
on eminent domain under
the public-use requirement

01:25:33.577 --> 01:25:35.676
of the Fifth Amendment.

01:25:35.678 --> 01:25:37.778
Every home, church,
or corner store

01:25:37.780 --> 01:25:39.915
would produce
more tax revenue and jobs

01:25:39.917 --> 01:25:41.716
if it were a Costco,
a shopping mall,

01:25:41.718 --> 01:25:43.387
or a private office building.

01:25:44.687 --> 01:25:46.587
If that's the justification
for the use,

01:25:46.589 --> 01:25:48.857
then any city can take
property anywhere

01:25:48.859 --> 01:25:50.992
within its borders for any use

01:25:50.994 --> 01:25:52.794
that might make more money
than what is there now.

01:25:52.796 --> 01:25:54.496
Mr. Bullock, you are leaving out

01:25:54.498 --> 01:25:57.698
that New London was in
a depressed economic condition.

01:25:57.700 --> 01:25:58.934
The critical fact
on the city side

01:25:58.936 --> 01:26:00.768
is that they wanted
to build it up,

01:26:00.770 --> 01:26:03.404
- <i>get more jobs.</i>
- Every city would like more tax revenue.

01:26:03.406 --> 01:26:05.374
GINSBURG But you concede
that on the fact,

01:26:05.376 --> 01:26:07.776
more than tax revenue
was at stake.

01:26:07.778 --> 01:26:09.611
The city wants
to improve the economy

01:26:09.613 --> 01:26:11.846
through tax revenue and jobs.

01:26:11.848 --> 01:26:13.849
But that cannot be
a justification

01:26:13.851 --> 01:26:15.617
for the use
of eminent domain.

01:26:15.619 --> 01:26:17.885
Then what
standard do you propose

01:26:17.887 --> 01:26:20.354
should draw a line
between when a city

01:26:20.356 --> 01:26:22.291
can take private land
and when they cannot?

01:26:22.293 --> 01:26:24.492
Municipalities should
never be able to take land

01:26:24.494 --> 01:26:26.627
- for private uses.
- <i>But every taking</i>

01:26:26.629 --> 01:26:27.996
has some public benefit,

01:26:27.998 --> 01:26:30.064
even if it's for private use.

01:26:30.066 --> 01:26:32.434
<i>So, given the fact
of the world,</i>

01:26:32.436 --> 01:26:34.670
why shouldn't the law
say virtually

01:26:34.672 --> 01:26:36.505
every taking is all right,

01:26:36.507 --> 01:26:38.840
<i>as long as there
is some public benefit?</i>

01:26:38.842 --> 01:26:40.408
Because, Your Honor,
then every property,

01:26:40.410 --> 01:26:42.743
every business,
every home can be taken

01:26:42.745 --> 01:26:43.879
for any private use.

01:26:43.881 --> 01:26:46.014
Only if there is a public use.

01:26:46.016 --> 01:26:47.983
And there almost always is.

01:26:47.985 --> 01:26:50.518
- <i>Do you agree with that?</i>
- <i>Do you want us to sit here</i>

01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:51.620
and evaluate the prospects

01:26:51.622 --> 01:26:54.055
of each condemnation,
one by one?

01:26:54.057 --> 01:26:55.191
<i>No, Your Honor.</i>

01:26:55.193 --> 01:26:57.591
Your Honors, I would like
to save my remaining time

01:26:57.593 --> 01:26:59.094
for after Mr. Harrigan's
arguments.

01:26:59.096 --> 01:27:01.499
Very well.
Mr. Harrigan.

01:27:04.967 --> 01:27:06.734
Your Honors.

01:27:06.736 --> 01:27:08.703
There is no principled basis
for a Court

01:27:08.705 --> 01:27:10.371
to make a value judgment
about a plan

01:27:10.373 --> 01:27:12.073
to revive an economically
depressed city.

01:27:12.075 --> 01:27:15.977
And where do you draw the line,
Mr. Harrigan?

01:27:15.979 --> 01:27:17.347
I wouldn't draw one.

01:27:18.781 --> 01:27:21.582
Say you had a
Motel 6 and the city says,

01:27:21.584 --> 01:27:22.783
"Well, if we had a Ritz-Carlton,

01:27:22.785 --> 01:27:24.486
we would have higher taxes."

01:27:24.488 --> 01:27:25.786
- Now, is that okay?
- Yes, Your Honor.

01:27:25.788 --> 01:27:27.589
That would be okay.

01:27:27.591 --> 01:27:29.691
<i>So, you can
take from A to give to B</i>

01:27:29.693 --> 01:27:31.026
<i>if B pays more taxes?</i>

01:27:31.028 --> 01:27:34.399
If it is a significant
amount, yes.

01:27:38.502 --> 01:27:40.969
<i>Mr. Bullock, you
have time remaining.</i>

01:27:40.971 --> 01:27:43.904
<i>Would you like to use it
for a rebuttal?</i>

01:27:43.906 --> 01:27:45.674
<i>Thank you, your Honor.</i>

01:27:45.676 --> 01:27:48.613
Can you take a Motel 6
and give it to a fancier hotel?

01:27:49.879 --> 01:27:51.481
Their answer is yes.

01:27:53.083 --> 01:27:55.015
The one thing that all
poor neighborhoods share

01:27:55.017 --> 01:27:57.786
is that they don't produce
much tax revenue.

01:27:57.788 --> 01:28:00.792
<i>If the Court affirms
the lower court's decision,</i>

01:28:01.958 --> 01:28:05.093
then you would put
poor neighborhoods

01:28:05.095 --> 01:28:06.728
and working-class neighborhoods

01:28:06.730 --> 01:28:09.464
like Fort Trumbull
in jeopardy.

01:28:56.879 --> 01:28:58.813
Congratulations, Jim.

01:28:58.815 --> 01:29:00.581
We won.
Five to four.

01:29:02.186 --> 01:29:03.852
The U.S. Supreme Court today

01:29:03.854 --> 01:29:05.620
made it a whole lot easier

01:29:05.622 --> 01:29:08.089
for someone to come in
and take your house,

01:29:08.091 --> 01:29:10.892
take your private property
against your will.

01:29:10.894 --> 01:29:12.594
The U.S. Supreme Court today

01:29:12.596 --> 01:29:14.696
affirmed the power
of local governments

01:29:14.698 --> 01:29:16.230
to seize private property.

01:29:16.232 --> 01:29:18.200
The government's right
to seize your home

01:29:18.202 --> 01:29:20.835
just received
a broad stamp of approval

01:29:20.837 --> 01:29:23.170
from the Supreme Court
of the United States.

01:29:23.172 --> 01:29:25.974
Man, it just seems
outrageous to me

01:29:25.976 --> 01:29:27.809
that you can take
private property

01:29:27.811 --> 01:29:30.178
from someone
and not build a highway

01:29:30.180 --> 01:29:32.112
or something that's really
just for the public

01:29:32.114 --> 01:29:34.816
but actually transfer
that property

01:29:34.818 --> 01:29:36.218
to another private owner.

01:29:36.220 --> 01:29:38.886
This decision
could be felt and soon

01:29:38.888 --> 01:29:41.055
in every city and town
in this country.

01:29:41.057 --> 01:29:43.625
And it seems to me sort
of a reverse Robin Hood

01:29:43.627 --> 01:29:45.093
where they're taking
from the poor, essentially,

01:29:45.095 --> 01:29:46.894
and giving to the rich.

01:29:46.896 --> 01:29:48.796
They can say, "You know what?
We see a better public use

01:29:48.798 --> 01:29:50.031
in your land for a Walmart.

01:29:50.033 --> 01:29:52.000
In fact, maybe
a parking lot is best."

01:29:52.002 --> 01:29:54.768
<i>New London homeowners
who spent five years fighting</i>

01:29:54.770 --> 01:29:55.871
<i>to keep their own houses</i>

01:29:55.873 --> 01:29:58.038
<i>now have 90 days to move out.</i>

01:30:09.653 --> 01:30:11.952
- <i>Susette?</i>
- <i>Save our homes!</i>

01:30:11.954 --> 01:30:15.225
- <i>They're ready for you.</i>
- <i>Hands off our homes!</i>

01:30:34.645 --> 01:30:37.748
Hands off our homes!
Hands off our homes!

01:30:55.132 --> 01:30:57.965
Thank you.
I'm...

01:30:57.967 --> 01:31:00.734
I see so many faces I know.

01:31:03.839 --> 01:31:06.875
Thank you all
for fighting so hard.

01:31:22.758 --> 01:31:26.163
This isn't about us
keeping our homes anymore.

01:31:27.964 --> 01:31:30.865
It's about people's
property rights

01:31:30.867 --> 01:31:33.033
all over the United States.

01:31:37.007 --> 01:31:39.974
There is no amount of money

01:31:39.976 --> 01:31:42.810
that could replace our homes.

01:31:49.386 --> 01:31:50.855
Or our memories.

01:31:54.925 --> 01:31:56.691
- And we will fight.
- Right!

01:31:59.061 --> 01:32:00.096
<i>I know that.</i>

01:32:01.198 --> 01:32:05.000
Because we won't quit now.

01:32:07.070 --> 01:32:11.072
This decision was so close.

01:32:11.074 --> 01:32:12.974
We finally shed some light

01:32:12.976 --> 01:32:15.410
on what happened here.

01:32:15.412 --> 01:32:18.112
This is where we chose to settle

01:32:18.114 --> 01:32:20.115
and this is where
we want to stay.

01:32:24.754 --> 01:32:25.987
This is America,

01:32:25.989 --> 01:32:28.255
the home of the free,
isn't it?

01:32:52.449 --> 01:32:55.753
Hands off our homes!
Hands off our homes!

01:33:12.002 --> 01:33:14.068
<i>The two most important things,</i>

01:33:14.070 --> 01:33:15.469
social justice

01:33:15.471 --> 01:33:18.206
and economic development,

01:33:18.208 --> 01:33:21.108
they go hand in hand.

01:33:21.110 --> 01:33:23.944
Now, what kind of world

01:33:23.946 --> 01:33:25.982
do we want to live in?

01:33:38.829 --> 01:33:40.495
But that cannot be
a justification

01:33:40.497 --> 01:33:42.996
for the use of eminent domain.

01:34:11.328 --> 01:34:13.193
<i>Ms. Kelo
came to Washington,</i>

01:34:13.195 --> 01:34:15.130
<i>and was in no mood
to compromise.</i>

01:34:15.132 --> 01:34:17.165
This battle against
eminent domain abuse

01:34:17.167 --> 01:34:18.265
may have started as a way for me

01:34:18.267 --> 01:34:20.068
to save my little pink cottage,

01:34:20.070 --> 01:34:23.203
but has rightfully grown
into something much larger.
