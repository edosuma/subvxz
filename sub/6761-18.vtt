02:02.079 --> 02:05.374
Brandon, it's not too late.
You've still got a week to go.

02:05.458 --> 02:08.169
Steve, I told you a month ago
I don't want to do it.

02:08.252 --> 02:11.589
Brandon, Alfred B. Cook guarantees
to raise your scores 200 points.

02:11.672 --> 02:13.883
That's 200 points or your money back.

02:13.966 --> 02:15.885
That could mean the difference
between Princeton and Pacoima.

02:15.968 --> 02:19.305
- You can't study for the SATs.
- I've been studying for weeks.

02:19.388 --> 02:23.767
- Well, you've been had.
- Brandon, look at this, just look at this.

02:23.851 --> 02:27.271
They offer this special Excelerator
crash course, okay?

02:27.354 --> 02:28.856
I'm only thinking of you, buddy.

02:28.939 --> 02:32.610
You know what they say,
"Alfred B. Cook or you be fried."

02:32.693 --> 02:34.445
- Five hundred bucks!
- So?

02:34.528 --> 02:35.988
Forget it.

02:36.071 --> 02:39.074
You can't make up for 16 years
of ignorance in one week.

02:39.158 --> 02:43.037
No, that's true, but it's incredible
what you can do in one month.

02:49.168 --> 02:50.919
You know, I've wondered
who's been masticating

02:51.003 --> 02:53.046
all the pencils around here.

02:54.381 --> 02:56.467
Masticating?
Why did you use that word?

02:56.550 --> 02:59.344
Because every time I turn around
to grab a new pencil, it's like...

02:59.428 --> 03:00.512
Teeth marks!

03:00.596 --> 03:02.473
Yeah, but you could have said chewed.

03:02.556 --> 03:04.850
I mean, masticating is the kind of word
they use on those SATs,

03:04.933 --> 03:08.854
the kind of word that you learn in one
of those expensive SAT prep courses.

03:08.937 --> 03:11.273
Like Alfred B. Cook?

03:12.399 --> 03:14.526
I knew you were taking
one of those prep courses.

03:14.610 --> 03:16.361
Let me just tell you something,
Brandon, okay?

03:16.445 --> 03:19.614
That puts you in an unfair advantage
over those people who cannot afford

03:19.698 --> 03:21.074
- those expensive courses.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:21.158 --> 03:24.911
Hold your fire, Andrea. First of all,
I'm not taking one of those courses.

03:24.995 --> 03:27.706
Steve is. And second of all,
I don't think they work.

03:27.789 --> 03:30.375
The SATs are designed to test you
on stuff you already know.

03:30.459 --> 03:33.128
- You can't cram for them.
- And then again, maybe you can.

03:33.211 --> 03:35.422
Maybe, just maybe,
there is some kind of system.

03:35.505 --> 03:37.883
Brandon, I am so bad
at standardized testing.

03:37.966 --> 03:40.093
I mean, the colleges,
they look at them as if they're gospel!

03:40.177 --> 03:43.013
- I don't know what to do. I mean, it's...
- Andrea, Andrea, Andrea, get a grip!

03:43.096 --> 03:45.849
We're talking about a test
you can retake twice if you want to.

03:46.016 --> 03:47.475
- A test that's...
- Going to determine

03:47.559 --> 03:50.687
whether I go to Princeton or Pacoima.

03:52.897 --> 03:54.899
Have you been talking to Steve?

03:55.942 --> 03:58.111
Ran into him at my locker.

03:58.945 --> 04:00.238
I figured that.

04:09.372 --> 04:12.542
- "Apotheosis."
- It's like the best.

04:13.793 --> 04:17.422
Very good.
"An exalted or glorified ideal."

04:17.880 --> 04:21.384
Sort of like Patrick Swayze is
the apotheosis of adorable.

04:21.843 --> 04:24.554
See, if they would put these words
in sentences that we could relate to,

04:24.637 --> 04:26.806
- this test would be a breeze.
- Don't count on it.

04:26.889 --> 04:28.600
I'm not counting on anything.

04:28.683 --> 04:31.311
The SATs test your entire brain.

04:31.811 --> 04:33.521
"Autodidactic."

04:34.230 --> 04:36.524
Isn't that something Madonna did
in her last video?

04:36.607 --> 04:38.192
I don't think so.

04:38.401 --> 04:40.570
Doesn't it have something to do
with cars?

04:40.653 --> 04:44.323
It means a person who is self-taught,
like us.

04:45.241 --> 04:48.744
You guys, what's the difference
between malignant and benign?

04:48.995 --> 04:53.207
- Benign is like harmless, isn't it?
- I think so.

04:53.958 --> 04:55.418
So malignant's bad?

04:55.501 --> 04:57.879
Like a malignant tumor
is the bad kind, right?

04:57.962 --> 04:59.005
Yeah.

05:00.214 --> 05:03.551
- Kelly, what are you reading?
- It's this test for breast cancer.

05:03.634 --> 05:05.261
You know, checking yourself for lumps.

05:05.344 --> 05:06.679
Kelly, that's something my mom does.

05:06.762 --> 05:09.390
I mean, we don't have to worry
about that stuff at our age.

05:09.473 --> 05:10.516
Thank God.

05:10.599 --> 05:14.937
I know, but it says here that
it's never too early to start the habit.

05:15.021 --> 05:18.107
"One out of nine American women
will get breast cancer.

05:18.190 --> 05:20.776
"And out of those,
one out of four will die."

05:21.277 --> 05:22.486
How awful.

05:24.405 --> 05:26.115
My aunt died of cancer.

05:28.117 --> 05:30.411
God, Brenda, I'm sorry.

05:30.953 --> 05:33.706
- When?
- Two years ago.

05:35.124 --> 05:38.210
It was my mom's younger sister
and my favorite aunt.

05:39.628 --> 05:41.755
I mean, it first started in her breast,

05:41.839 --> 05:45.217
and she had to get, you know,
mastectomy.

05:45.843 --> 05:49.513
They thought that it was over,
but six months later it came back,

05:50.264 --> 05:52.975
entered through her lymph system
or something.

05:53.517 --> 05:55.436
She died on her birthday.

05:55.769 --> 05:58.647
- How old was she?
- Thirty-five.

06:03.986 --> 06:06.822
- Kelly, what are you doing?
- I'm taking this test.

06:06.905 --> 06:09.116
- Now?
- Yes.

06:09.324 --> 06:13.537
Which do you think is more important?
The SATs aren't gonna save your life.

06:17.916 --> 06:19.126
Okay.

06:21.628 --> 06:24.089
- All clear?
- All clear.

06:24.172 --> 06:25.257
Good.

06:25.340 --> 06:27.551
Okay, move your pillows
and let's check the left breast.

06:27.634 --> 06:29.469
Yes, Dr Taylor.

06:29.886 --> 06:33.932
Okay, now with your hand held flat,

06:34.641 --> 06:37.936
press gently with circular motions
to feel the inner, upper quarter

06:38.019 --> 06:39.604
of your left breast,
starting at the breastbone

06:39.688 --> 06:41.773
and moving to the nipple.

06:43.316 --> 06:45.694
Brenda, maybe you should tell Dylan
to do this.

06:45.777 --> 06:48.154
Kelly, this is supposed to be serious.

06:48.905 --> 06:51.825
Okay, bring your left arm down

06:51.908 --> 06:54.619
and press under your armpit.

06:55.704 --> 06:58.665
- Aren't you glad you used Dial?
- Donna!

06:59.374 --> 07:01.209
- I'm sorry.
- Okay, wait,

07:01.293 --> 07:04.838
finally, feel the lower, outer portion
of your breast,

07:04.921 --> 07:07.716
going from the outer part to the nipple.

07:08.925 --> 07:10.969
- All clear?
- All clear.

07:14.180 --> 07:15.306
All clear.

07:29.779 --> 07:32.574
- Brenda, dinner.
- All right, I'm coming.

07:32.782 --> 07:34.117
You've been in there for an hour.

07:34.200 --> 07:36.786
Don't you know
there's a water shortage?

07:38.454 --> 07:40.623
Brenda, dinner!

07:42.125 --> 07:43.918
Forget it.
That's the last time I'm calling her.

07:44.002 --> 07:45.545
I hope it's not one of those diets.

07:45.628 --> 07:48.464
She's probably just recovering
from all that studying she did

07:48.548 --> 07:52.552
- at Kelly's this afternoon.
- Kelly studies? I can't picture it.

07:52.802 --> 07:56.722
Well, it's for the SATs on Saturday.
They're making everybody crazy.

07:56.848 --> 07:59.475
You know what the absolute worst part
about the test is?

07:59.559 --> 08:00.643
What?

08:00.726 --> 08:04.188
The months of waiting afterwards
for your results to show up in the mail,

08:04.272 --> 08:05.856
this little sealed envelope

08:05.940 --> 08:07.817
that basically holds the keys
to your entire future.

08:07.900 --> 08:12.405
- Brandon, it's not life or death.
- What's not life or death?

08:12.738 --> 08:15.449
- Nice of you to make an appearance.
- Hey, there.

08:15.533 --> 08:16.575
The SATs.

08:17.493 --> 08:20.621
I'm so sick of hearing
about those things.

08:20.746 --> 08:23.040
Expect the worst. Hope for the best.

08:23.124 --> 08:25.668
Well, that's an awful cheery outlook.

08:25.751 --> 08:28.379
I would rather be surprised
than disappointed.

08:28.462 --> 08:30.714
Don't worry about it, you'll do fine.

08:30.798 --> 08:32.383
How do you know that, Brandon?

08:32.466 --> 08:34.635
Maybe I won't. Maybe you won't.

08:36.554 --> 08:40.140
Hey, easy. It's not that big of a deal.

08:41.558 --> 08:44.812
I'm sorry. It's just all this stuff
with the SATs has got me going nuts.

08:44.895 --> 08:47.439
Exactly! That's just
what I was telling you guys about.

08:47.523 --> 08:50.859
It's starting to be like mass hysteria.
It's not worth it.

08:50.943 --> 08:52.528
Definitely not.

08:58.784 --> 09:01.412
Mom, can I talk to you for a second
in my room?

09:01.495 --> 09:02.705
Sure, honey.

09:03.205 --> 09:07.209
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah, I just need to talk to Mom alone.

09:14.967 --> 09:18.262
So we were all at Kelly's
studying for the SATs,

09:18.595 --> 09:22.683
and she was reading this magazine,
and it had this thing in it about,

09:23.433 --> 09:26.770
oh, you know, where you check
your breasts for lumps.

09:29.147 --> 09:31.441
So we all decide to do it.
I don't know why.

09:31.525 --> 09:32.693
I guess we were just bored.

09:32.776 --> 09:35.696
Honey, that's not something
you have to worry about as a teenager.

09:35.779 --> 09:39.783
Well, the article said that even
young girls should get into the habit.

09:40.617 --> 09:44.955
So, I did the test,
and I thought that I felt something.

09:46.414 --> 09:47.457
Where?

09:48.583 --> 09:51.962
- Here.
- Let me feel it.

09:54.506 --> 09:57.634
- I'm sure it's nothing.
- I'm sure it's nothing, too.

09:59.344 --> 10:02.138
- Do you feel it?
- I feel something.

10:03.682 --> 10:05.600
- Does it hurt?
- No.

10:06.977 --> 10:11.773
I mean, I didn't really feel it until,
and realize it was there,

10:12.065 --> 10:13.525
till we did this.

10:14.359 --> 10:15.735
Don't tell Dad.

10:16.820 --> 10:17.987
Why?

10:18.696 --> 10:20.907
I don't know. I'm just embarrassed.

10:20.990 --> 10:24.410
Honey, there's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

10:25.453 --> 10:27.747
Tomorrow morning,
we'll go see a doctor,

10:27.831 --> 10:30.375
and we'll have this thing checked out.
I'm sure it's nothing.

10:30.458 --> 10:33.169
Is that what Aunt Sheila thought

10:33.378 --> 10:37.590
when she found a lump on her breast?
Did she think that it was nothing, too?

10:38.007 --> 10:40.426
Honey, it's not the same thing.

10:40.718 --> 10:42.887
When you're older, it's different.

10:44.347 --> 10:48.518
- I know. It just freaked me out.
- I'm sure it did, sweetheart.

10:52.063 --> 10:54.023
But it'll be fine, you'll see.

10:54.232 --> 10:57.985
There's a good explanation for this,
and tomorrow morning, we'll get it.

10:58.069 --> 10:59.112
Okay.

11:02.907 --> 11:06.410
- You get a good night's sleep.
- I will. Good night, Mom.

11:08.204 --> 11:09.622
Good night, honey.

11:25.054 --> 11:27.431
You know, I can't believe
we've been here for six months

11:27.515 --> 11:30.518
and we still don't have
a family physician like Dr Kellman.

11:30.601 --> 11:33.646
You know, I'm almost tempted to fly
Brenda back to Minneapolis to see him.

11:33.729 --> 11:35.898
I'll ask around at work.
I'll find somebody good.

11:35.981 --> 11:37.316
- Somebody great.
- Somebody great.

11:37.399 --> 11:40.319
- I want to take her in today.
- It's my first priority.

11:40.402 --> 11:43.864
- I'm sure it's nothing.
- Of course it's nothing.

11:44.532 --> 11:47.409
It just brings back
so much about Sheila.

11:47.493 --> 11:49.078
I mean, she never had a good doctor.

11:49.161 --> 11:51.038
That was her problem
right from the start.

11:51.121 --> 11:53.916
A good specialist
would have caught it earlier

11:53.999 --> 11:57.211
and would've done
the proper surgery when the time came.

11:57.711 --> 12:00.714
I still think the chemo was a mistake,
wore her down.

12:00.798 --> 12:03.050
- I think it made her worse.
- Cindy,

12:03.258 --> 12:04.843
whatever is wrong with Brenda

12:04.927 --> 12:07.846
has nothing to do
with what was wrong with Sheila.

12:08.138 --> 12:10.724
- I hope you're right.
- Of course I'm right.

12:11.391 --> 12:12.768
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, Brenda.

12:12.851 --> 12:13.894
You told him, didn't you?

12:13.977 --> 12:15.813
Brenda, it's nothing to be
embarrassed about.

12:15.896 --> 12:17.356
Dad, I know that.

12:17.731 --> 12:20.234
I just didn't want you
getting upset over nothing.

12:20.317 --> 12:23.111
- I'm not upset.
- Well, why not?

12:25.072 --> 12:27.491
Because it could be a million things.

12:27.783 --> 12:31.411
- Like what?
- I don't know. Maybe it's...

12:33.205 --> 12:36.625
- Well, an ingrown hair.
- An ingrown hair?

12:36.750 --> 12:40.253
On my left breast? I sincerely hope not.

12:40.671 --> 12:42.964
You know, Mom, this is why
I didn't want you to tell him.

12:43.048 --> 12:46.426
This is the kind of explanation
Brandon would come up with.

12:46.510 --> 12:48.595
- What is?
- Nothing.

12:56.770 --> 13:01.066
The outer ear collects sound waves
and directs them

13:01.566 --> 13:02.901
to the eardrum.

13:03.109 --> 13:07.364
Its vibrations are transferred
by three small bones

13:07.447 --> 13:09.616
to the snail-like cochlea,

13:09.699 --> 13:13.787
which is divided into two
cavities by the basilar membrane,

13:13.870 --> 13:18.458
which runs into a complex structure,
the organ of Corti.

13:22.087 --> 13:23.338
Excuse me.

13:33.139 --> 13:35.975
Shoot me before I die of boredom.

13:37.393 --> 13:39.979
Shoot me
before I die of embarrassment.

13:40.063 --> 13:43.149
- What is your mom doing here?
- I'll tell you later.

13:44.234 --> 13:46.361
Mom, I thought we were gonna meet
after school.

13:46.444 --> 13:48.571
Well, I was, but I got an appointment
with a doctor

13:48.655 --> 13:51.366
who came very highly recommended
from one of your father's clients.

13:51.449 --> 13:53.785
She was booked for the day,
but she said she could squeeze you in

13:53.868 --> 13:56.120
- if we get there before 2:00.
- She?

13:56.204 --> 13:57.246
Yes, she.

13:58.206 --> 13:59.374
Mrs Morgan, you're next, please.

14:00.583 --> 14:03.086
- Hello, I'm Dr Donner.
- Cindy Walsh.

14:03.169 --> 14:04.712
And this is my daughter Brenda.

14:04.796 --> 14:05.922
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:07.590 --> 14:09.592
So, what seems to be the problem,
Brenda?

14:09.675 --> 14:13.638
Well, as I told you over the phone,
Brenda discovered some sort of lump

14:13.721 --> 14:15.389
or a bump on her breast the other day.

14:15.473 --> 14:16.557
- Left or right?
- Left.

14:16.641 --> 14:20.061
And so naturally I was concerned that
she have it checked out immediately.

14:20.144 --> 14:21.270
I see.

14:21.854 --> 14:24.607
Well, in the vast majority of cases
involving women your age,

14:24.690 --> 14:27.985
this is nothing to be
too concerned about, but we'll see.

14:28.903 --> 14:32.198
I see there's a maternal history
of cancer in the family.

14:32.615 --> 14:35.451
Yes, that's right.
My grandmother and my sister.

14:36.160 --> 14:38.079
And when did your sister die?

14:38.579 --> 14:40.790
- Two years ago.
- I'm sorry.

14:41.791 --> 14:44.877
- Younger or older?
- Younger. By five years.

14:45.002 --> 14:46.545
She died very young.

14:47.671 --> 14:50.382
So, tell me, Brenda,
how did you detect this lump?

14:50.466 --> 14:51.509
With some friends.

14:51.592 --> 14:54.011
We were just following this article
on how to test ourselves.

14:54.094 --> 14:57.139
That's very commendable.
I wish more women would do that.

14:57.223 --> 14:59.183
Had you ever noticed
a breast mass before?

14:59.266 --> 15:00.434
No.

15:00.601 --> 15:03.937
Well, actually, two months ago,
I got bruised playing volleyball.

15:04.021 --> 15:05.898
You knew about this two months ago?

15:05.981 --> 15:07.650
But, Mom, I didn't think
it was that big of a deal.

15:07.733 --> 15:10.027
I mean, I didn't even connect it
until now.

15:10.110 --> 15:12.905
Well, quite often that's the way
that women are initially alerted

15:12.988 --> 15:14.114
to a breast mass.

15:14.198 --> 15:16.950
They're fooled into thinking
that it's from some external trauma,

15:17.034 --> 15:19.286
when, in fact,
it's really been there all along.

15:19.369 --> 15:20.496
I see.

15:21.079 --> 15:23.791
Mrs Walsh, would you mind
if I talked to Brenda alone?

15:23.874 --> 15:25.000
Well, I...

15:26.043 --> 15:27.753
No, of course not.

15:27.836 --> 15:29.838
I'll call you back
in just a couple of minutes.

15:29.922 --> 15:32.507
Sure. I'll be right outside
if you need me.

15:37.012 --> 15:39.890
She's just a little overprotective.

15:41.141 --> 15:45.062
Brenda, I wanted to talk to you alone
because it's important that you realize

15:45.145 --> 15:47.856
that your relationship with me
is entirely confidential.

15:47.939 --> 15:51.443
Nothing you say goes beyond
these doors. Not to your parents.

15:51.568 --> 15:53.945
Not to your clergyman. No one.

15:54.196 --> 15:56.114
What you tell me is private.

15:56.239 --> 15:58.992
And I want you to feel free to come
and see me for any reason.

15:59.075 --> 16:00.869
- Okay?
- Okay.

16:01.369 --> 16:03.538
Okay. Why don't you lay back here?

16:09.002 --> 16:12.213
- So tell me, where's the lump?
- Right here.

16:14.007 --> 16:15.050
Okay.

16:16.384 --> 16:19.471
Now, we can assume
that it's been there for over two months.

16:19.554 --> 16:22.891
In that time,
has it changed size or shape at all?

16:23.266 --> 16:24.851
I don't think so. No.

16:25.560 --> 16:28.563
Does it hurt? Is it tender to the touch?

16:28.938 --> 16:29.981
No.

16:30.398 --> 16:31.691
Do you feel it?

16:32.609 --> 16:35.695
- Do you think it's something really bad?
- I doubt it.

16:36.196 --> 16:38.698
Then why haven't
you sent me home yet?

16:39.324 --> 16:42.202
Has the lump changed size at all
with your period?

16:42.285 --> 16:43.328
No.

16:43.411 --> 16:46.456
- When was your last period?
- Just a couple of days ago.

16:46.539 --> 16:48.041
And no change?

16:48.124 --> 16:49.667
Not that I noticed.

16:50.251 --> 16:51.878
Why don't you come up?

16:55.465 --> 16:58.593
Has there been any discharge
from the nipple or change in the skin

16:58.676 --> 17:00.970
- in the area around it?
- Never.

17:01.721 --> 17:04.223
Am I going to need a mammogram?

17:04.640 --> 17:07.894
No, we don't usually do mammograms
for women your age.

17:08.435 --> 17:11.856
What I am going to need to do
is a needle biopsy to test the lump.

17:11.939 --> 17:14.901
And that'll tell us right away
whether what you have is just a cyst,

17:14.983 --> 17:17.612
or something
that needs to be tested further.

17:18.613 --> 17:21.031
Does a needle biopsy
have anything to do with a needle?

17:21.115 --> 17:22.657
I'm afraid so.

17:23.201 --> 17:25.953
Do you mind if my mom comes back
into the room?

17:26.078 --> 17:27.246
Not at all.

17:30.207 --> 17:32.585
Hey, you guys.
Steve, Brandon, wait up. Hey.

17:32.668 --> 17:34.920
- Hey, Andrea.
- Hey, how you doing?

17:35.004 --> 17:36.714
So, where are you guys going?

17:36.797 --> 17:38.841
I got to get out of here. I'm late for work.

17:38.924 --> 17:42.386
- I'm going to Alfred B. Cook.
- Oh, really? Right now?

17:42.470 --> 17:46.974
Yeah, you know what they say,
"Alfred B. Cook or you be fried."

17:47.057 --> 17:50.811
Tell me, do they give any pointers
on how to, let's say,

17:50.895 --> 17:53.189
improve your test-taking skills?

17:53.272 --> 17:55.441
Oh, yeah.
It's an integral part of the course.

17:55.524 --> 17:58.652
"Integral," guys.
Know it, it's gonna be on the test.

17:58.736 --> 18:01.530
- You can trust me on that one.
- Never. I gotta get out of here.

18:01.614 --> 18:03.115
- I'll see you guys later.
- Later, buddy.

18:03.198 --> 18:04.408
- Bye, Brandon.
- Say hello to Nat.

18:04.491 --> 18:09.038
- Steve, Steve. Steve, Steve.
- What, Andrea?

18:09.121 --> 18:11.749
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to claw you,

18:11.874 --> 18:14.418
it's just that I'm in a desperate situation.

18:14.501 --> 18:17.171
- What's the matter?
- Well, the SATs, they're on Saturday.

18:17.254 --> 18:20.299
- Yeah, so what?
- So I was wondering

18:20.382 --> 18:22.551
- if I could...
- What?

18:23.927 --> 18:27.097
Could I come over to your house
tonight and study with you after class?

18:27.181 --> 18:29.141
Are you asking me for a date?

18:29.224 --> 18:32.394
No. No, what I'm asking you for
is the Alfred B. Cook advantage.

18:32.477 --> 18:36.690
You know, notes, drills, practice tests.
Secret documents,

18:36.773 --> 18:38.317
whatever you have.

18:39.109 --> 18:40.652
- Know where I live?
- No.

18:40.736 --> 18:43.822
Can you put down your address
and your phone number?

18:44.531 --> 18:47.909
- Say 8:00?
- 8:00 is fine.

18:48.702 --> 18:50.787
You know, we have a reputation
to uphold.

18:50.871 --> 18:53.331
Did you know that West Beverly
and Beverly Hills High

18:53.415 --> 18:56.460
have some of the highest SAT averages
in California?

18:56.835 --> 18:58.378
How illuminating.

19:00.088 --> 19:02.090
Don't forget, take good notes!

19:03.383 --> 19:07.262
I've just got to tell you that I really,
really, really, really hate needles.

19:07.345 --> 19:10.348
I promise you,
with the Xylocaine you'll hardly feel it.

19:10.432 --> 19:11.641
That's what they all say.

19:11.725 --> 19:14.019
Just squeeze my hand if it hurts, honey.

19:14.102 --> 19:16.187
You're lucky I don't have nails.

19:17.230 --> 19:19.316
What I'm gonna do is insert the needle

19:19.399 --> 19:21.818
and try to withdraw fluid from the lump.

19:21.901 --> 19:25.030
Now, if there is any fluid, we'll know
that what you have is just a cyst,

19:25.113 --> 19:26.573
and they'll be nothing more
to worry about.

19:26.656 --> 19:29.034
Okay. I know this is for a good cause.

19:32.620 --> 19:36.249
- I haven't done anything yet.
- Well, tell me when.

19:36.541 --> 19:37.584
Not yet.

19:50.263 --> 19:53.016
- Are you going to do it yet?
- I did it.

19:54.100 --> 19:57.103
You're kidding. That was nothing.

19:57.562 --> 19:59.188
So what does that tell you?

19:59.272 --> 20:03.318
What it tells me is that what you have
in your breast is solid. It's not a cyst.

20:03.401 --> 20:06.738
And in order to know more,
we're going to have to conduct a biopsy.

20:06.821 --> 20:09.615
- Oh, my God.
- Why? What does that mean?

20:09.699 --> 20:11.784
- What's wrong?
- Probably nothing.

20:11.868 --> 20:14.704
I don't understand.
I mean, Brenda's only 16 years old.

20:14.787 --> 20:17.874
I mean, what are the chances
that this could be cancerous?

20:17.957 --> 20:19.083
Very slim.

20:19.459 --> 20:21.294
Brenda, would you excuse us
for a minute?

20:21.377 --> 20:23.629
I want to talk to Dr Donner alone
in the hallway for a moment.

20:23.713 --> 20:25.715
- Mom.
- Honey...

20:25.798 --> 20:28.801
I'm sorry, Mrs Walsh, but I can't
discuss Brenda's case with you

20:28.885 --> 20:30.469
without Brenda being present.

20:30.553 --> 20:32.555
But I always like to be
up front with my patients

20:32.638 --> 20:35.891
- and give the worst-case scenario.
- Hope for the best. Expect the worst.

20:35.975 --> 20:39.687
Now on the upside, 81% of these cases
are usually fibroadenomas

20:39.770 --> 20:42.732
- or benign tumors.
- And the other 19%?

20:42.815 --> 20:45.776
Non-cancerous lesions
and sometimes cancer.

20:46.110 --> 20:49.697
Given Brenda's young age,
I rate that highly unlikely.

20:49.780 --> 20:53.659
But given your maternal family history
of cancer, nothing can be ruled out

20:53.742 --> 20:55.327
until we conduct a biopsy.

21:01.041 --> 21:04.211
The soonest I can schedule something
would be Saturday.

21:04.295 --> 21:05.588
That's my SATs.

21:06.589 --> 21:09.258
- Can't you make them up?
- I guess so.

21:12.720 --> 21:15.431
Mom, don't worry, I'm gonna be fine.

21:15.848 --> 21:19.601
I know you will, honey.
I know you're gonna be just fine.

21:26.859 --> 21:28.861
It's exactly the way it started
with my sister.

21:28.944 --> 21:32.656
Cindy, Sheila was a lot older
than Brenda. And you heard the doctor.

21:32.739 --> 21:34.241
Age is an important factor
in this disease.

21:34.324 --> 21:37.828
- So is family history.
- Oh, God, I hate slicing onions.

21:37.911 --> 21:40.080
- I'll do it.
- No, no, I'm doing it.

21:40.581 --> 21:42.332
I just can't believe it.

21:42.833 --> 21:44.209
She's so young.

21:46.253 --> 21:48.005
It doesn't seem possible.

21:51.925 --> 21:55.053
I just can't conceive of anything
happening to Brenda.

21:55.178 --> 21:58.515
Baby, it's gonna be all right. I know it is.

21:59.766 --> 22:01.601
I hope to God you're right.

22:03.854 --> 22:07.274
I really wish you'd stop talking
about me behind my back like that.

22:07.357 --> 22:09.985
- Brenda, we weren't.
- It's these onions.

22:10.861 --> 22:13.738
Mom, you heard the doctor.
It's probably nothing.

22:14.156 --> 22:15.782
I'm sure it's nothing.

22:15.866 --> 22:17.701
I mean, it's a good thing you found it.

22:17.784 --> 22:19.703
It's just something
that should be looked into.

22:19.786 --> 22:22.289
So don't make more out of it than it is.

22:22.539 --> 22:23.915
I'm not.

22:25.417 --> 22:27.961
- Hey, everybody.
- Hey, big guy.

22:28.044 --> 22:31.381
Brenda, I heard you left school
a little early today.

22:31.798 --> 22:34.843
Yeah, it's no big deal,
but just don't say anything.

22:35.093 --> 22:36.428
Why? What is it?

22:37.637 --> 22:39.347
I went to a doctor.

22:41.725 --> 22:43.435
Why? Is something wrong?

22:44.561 --> 22:45.645
Sort of.

22:48.022 --> 22:50.400
I have a tumor in my breast.

22:54.821 --> 22:57.615
- What does that mean?
- Probably nothing.

22:58.074 --> 23:01.244
They're gonna do a biopsy Saturday
to find out more.

23:06.499 --> 23:07.542
Is it...

23:10.503 --> 23:13.506
It's not... I mean, do they think it...

23:14.257 --> 23:18.010
- That's very unlikely, right, Mom?
- Highly. Highly unlikely.

23:18.094 --> 23:19.262
Absolutely.

23:19.470 --> 23:22.557
They're just doing it to find out more,
to make sure.

23:25.768 --> 23:30.022
Well, look on the bright side.
At least you get to miss the SATs.

23:31.482 --> 23:34.569
Brandon, right now,
that's the last thing on my mind.

23:39.657 --> 23:42.285
- Okay, you've got four choices, right?
- Right.

23:42.368 --> 23:45.204
Out of those four,
one will be a total throwaway.

23:45.287 --> 23:46.664
- It is?
- Yeah.

23:46.747 --> 23:49.291
They do that
so they can weed out the morons.

23:49.375 --> 23:50.793
You're kidding.
I could spend 10 minutes

23:50.876 --> 23:52.378
trying to figure out why they put it there.

23:52.461 --> 23:55.923
Well, don't. It's just a trick, okay?
Now you've got three choices left.

23:56.006 --> 24:00.970
Now, of those three choices, one word
will often mean the total opposite,

24:01.303 --> 24:04.098
- so you can rule that one out.
- And, of course, I never do.

24:04.181 --> 24:07.393
Okay, now you're down to two choices,
and even if you don't know

24:07.476 --> 24:10.521
the right answer, you still have
a 50-50 chance of guessing right.

24:10.604 --> 24:12.690
God, that makes it so much easier.

24:12.773 --> 24:15.317
Well, yeah, you just can't spend
too much time on one question.

24:15.401 --> 24:19.488
You have to go through the test
with total confidence and no hesitation.

24:20.614 --> 24:22.116
I hope I can do it.

24:24.034 --> 24:26.453
Yeah, you can do it.
You're smart already.

24:26.537 --> 24:28.747
- In fact, that's your problem.
- Why?

24:28.831 --> 24:31.834
- Because you outsmart yourself.
- Yeah, I know.

24:31.917 --> 24:34.670
Sometimes I wish I wasn't so smart.

24:35.003 --> 24:36.296
You know what?

24:37.089 --> 24:39.216
You're pretty cute
without your glasses on.

24:39.299 --> 24:43.554
God! Is that supposed to be
some kind of compliment?

24:44.304 --> 24:47.307
No. This is.

25:00.737 --> 25:04.032
- I got to go. I...
- Now?

25:04.116 --> 25:06.952
- Yeah, it's getting late.
- It is?

25:08.203 --> 25:12.165
Look, I'm sure that you helped
my score two, three hundred points.

25:12.416 --> 25:13.708
Anytime.

25:16.419 --> 25:18.296
Did I forget anything? I...

25:20.298 --> 25:22.342
I guess I'm off.

25:23.927 --> 25:24.970
Bye.

25:35.397 --> 25:38.108
Mom won't even look at these pictures.

25:38.817 --> 25:41.569
It's like she wants to forget her
or something.

25:42.612 --> 25:44.656
It's just hard for her, Brenda.

25:45.407 --> 25:48.201
- They were so close.
- Tell me about it.

25:50.328 --> 25:54.124
I used to wish that Sheila was my mom
and Mom was my aunt.

25:55.583 --> 25:57.126
She was so much fun.

25:59.128 --> 26:00.838
Did you ever wish that?

26:02.006 --> 26:03.800
Not after she got sick.

26:04.884 --> 26:06.636
Yeah, it was awful.

26:08.137 --> 26:11.432
With her losing her breast
and then all her hair.

26:14.477 --> 26:17.021
I couldn't imagine that
ever happening to me.

26:17.563 --> 26:18.690
It won't.

26:21.776 --> 26:23.194
I'll protect you.

26:24.654 --> 26:25.780
You can't.

26:27.657 --> 26:29.075
That's the thing.

26:29.909 --> 26:31.619
Nobody can protect you.

26:34.956 --> 26:39.168
You want to know the thing I remember
most about Sheila after she got sick?

26:39.877 --> 26:40.920
What?

26:43.172 --> 26:44.799
How lonely she was.

26:45.633 --> 26:48.052
And no matter how much love
we gave her,

26:48.844 --> 26:51.597
she just kept on getting lonelier
and lonelier.

26:53.891 --> 26:56.852
After she died,
it was Mom who got lonely.

26:57.770 --> 26:58.813
I know.

27:01.482 --> 27:04.610
It must've been such a relief for her
to move out here.

27:05.194 --> 27:07.822
Kind of like running away
from bad memories.

27:08.614 --> 27:10.324
She didn't get very far.

27:11.700 --> 27:15.287
Hey, you're going to be just fine.

27:16.330 --> 27:18.332
How do you know that, Brandon?

27:18.958 --> 27:22.419
Because I'm older. And wiser.

27:25.339 --> 27:27.841
And just how much wisdom
did you accumulate

27:27.925 --> 27:30.219
in those momentous four minutes?

27:31.428 --> 27:34.306
- A small lifetime.
- Very small.

27:37.684 --> 27:41.146
My eye! My eye! My eye!

27:51.615 --> 27:53.992
Hey, Brandon,
I've been looking all over for you.

27:54.076 --> 27:55.244
Hey, chief.

27:56.495 --> 27:57.579
Where's your lunch?

27:57.663 --> 27:59.539
Are you kidding?
Who could think about food?

27:59.623 --> 28:03.085
- The SATs are tomorrow.
- That they are.

28:04.586 --> 28:07.422
Is Steve joining you today?

28:07.798 --> 28:09.716
- No.
- Good.

28:11.426 --> 28:15.430
Because there's something really
important I want to talk to you about.

28:16.390 --> 28:20.477
Actually, there's something
pretty important I wanted to tell you.

28:21.978 --> 28:23.021
What?

28:23.730 --> 28:26.233
You've got to swear you won't repeat it.

28:26.775 --> 28:28.109
Swear.

28:30.987 --> 28:32.030
Well,

28:33.490 --> 28:38.495
Brenda found out yesterday she has
some sort of tumor in her breast.

28:40.997 --> 28:42.082
What?

28:43.750 --> 28:46.878
They're doing some sort of biopsy deal
on it tomorrow.

28:48.380 --> 28:51.966
- Is she going to be okay?
- Probably.

28:56.179 --> 28:58.139
I wanted to tell you because

28:59.682 --> 29:03.269
I feel like I can't really flip out at home
in front of Brenda.

29:03.561 --> 29:08.650
When the truth is,
inside I'm flipping out.

29:09.859 --> 29:11.236
I can imagine.

29:12.820 --> 29:16.199
- I mean, I know she's gonna be fine.
- Of course she's gonna be fine.

29:16.282 --> 29:18.701
Hey, I'm sure she's gonna be all right.

29:21.079 --> 29:24.248
But then again,
there's always that chance,

29:27.877 --> 29:29.921
and I can't even comprehend it.

29:32.006 --> 29:35.134
So you've just gotta wait
till after tomorrow.

29:39.180 --> 29:43.017
- Don't tell her I said anything, okay?
- Swear.

29:46.145 --> 29:51.275
You know, Brandon,
you can tell me anything.

29:51.442 --> 29:55.321
- I mean, I'll always be here for you.
- Thanks.

30:00.743 --> 30:02.953
So, what did you want to tell me?

30:05.998 --> 30:07.124
Forget it.

30:11.003 --> 30:14.048
Brenda, why didn't you say anything
when you were at my house?

30:14.131 --> 30:16.342
Because we were all just sort of
doing it as a joke.

30:16.425 --> 30:19.553
I mean, I wasn't even sure what I felt
until I got home.

30:19.637 --> 30:21.472
So, what does it feel like?

30:23.307 --> 30:25.100
Like a hard little lump.

30:26.101 --> 30:27.561
It's kind of deep.

30:28.270 --> 30:31.190
- I can't believe this.
- I can't either.

30:31.857 --> 30:35.527
But it's probably nothing.
I mean, that's what they said, right?

30:35.819 --> 30:36.862
Right.

30:37.654 --> 30:40.366
We'll know for sure tomorrow
after the biopsy.

30:41.033 --> 30:43.160
Wow, that sounds so clinical.

30:43.660 --> 30:46.163
- I really hate hospitals.
- So do I.

30:46.246 --> 30:47.289
So do I.

30:48.081 --> 30:50.000
I sort of feel like this is all my fault.

30:50.083 --> 30:52.711
I mean, I started this whole thing.

30:53.212 --> 30:55.631
- No, I'm glad that I found it.
- You are?

30:56.924 --> 31:00.385
Wow! I really hope nothing ever
happens to my breasts.

31:00.469 --> 31:01.762
Mine either.

31:03.597 --> 31:06.224
Brenda, I just...
I don't know how you can deal with this.

31:06.308 --> 31:09.394
I mean, all the waiting and not knowing.

31:10.646 --> 31:12.731
I guess I don't have any choice.

31:22.449 --> 31:25.660
- Guess who?
- Dylan, that's not funny. Dylan!

31:26.620 --> 31:29.915
Well, aren't we touchy today.
Is that SAT pressure?

31:29.998 --> 31:33.168
- No.
- Yes, it is. The whole school's on edge.

31:33.460 --> 31:35.962
That's why I only take
these things once. Senior year.

31:36.046 --> 31:39.216
While you guys tomorrow are suffering,
I'll be surfing.

31:39.424 --> 31:42.218
- Dylan, I'm scared.
- Hey, Bren.

31:42.344 --> 31:43.970
It's only a test.

31:47.390 --> 31:49.601
I'm going to the hospital tomorrow.

31:49.726 --> 31:51.311
I found something.

31:51.394 --> 31:54.397
What are you talking about? What do
you mean you found something?

31:54.481 --> 31:56.775
I didn't want to tell you.
I was embarrassed.

31:56.858 --> 31:59.944
Brenda, what is it? What?
What did you find?

32:00.862 --> 32:02.405
A lump in my breast.

32:10.580 --> 32:12.040
I'm gonna be there.

32:13.208 --> 32:16.419
Dylan, I don't want you there.

32:16.502 --> 32:18.922
I'm gonna be there.

32:20.089 --> 32:23.509
- It's changed things, hasn't it?
- No, it hasn't.

32:24.260 --> 32:26.888
You didn't even want to touch me
after I told you.

32:26.971 --> 32:30.058
I was surprised. I was scared.

32:30.641 --> 32:31.768
So am I.

32:32.268 --> 32:34.520
Brenda, I love you.

32:36.814 --> 32:38.608
You're only saying that.

32:49.827 --> 32:50.870
Come in.

32:52.538 --> 32:53.831
What you doing?

32:54.749 --> 32:56.000
Just thinking.

32:56.459 --> 32:57.585
About what?

32:59.378 --> 33:02.965
Life, death, love.

33:04.800 --> 33:06.469
Pretty weighty subjects.

33:07.136 --> 33:10.056
You know what I'm scared about
more than anything?

33:10.848 --> 33:11.891
What?

33:14.810 --> 33:17.480
The thought of losing a breast.

33:19.565 --> 33:22.485
How can I ever go on a date
if that ever happened?

33:22.943 --> 33:25.779
Believe me, Brenda,
that is not going to happen.

33:27.031 --> 33:28.866
Is that what you told Sheila?

33:28.949 --> 33:31.410
Honey, if Sheila had started
checking herself at your age

33:31.493 --> 33:32.995
everything probably
would have been fine.

33:33.078 --> 33:35.164
Why is this happening to me?

33:36.081 --> 33:37.666
Mom, I am so scared.

33:38.167 --> 33:40.878
And people keep on telling me
that everything's gonna be okay,

33:40.961 --> 33:42.796
but what if it's not?

33:44.423 --> 33:48.010
What if I go in to have
that biopsy tomorrow and they discover

33:48.093 --> 33:49.803
that things aren't okay?

33:50.596 --> 33:53.640
We'll just cross that bridge
when we come to it.

33:56.768 --> 34:00.856
- I need to make a phone call in private.
- Oh, sure.

34:05.861 --> 34:07.738
Come down to dinner
when you're through.

34:07.821 --> 34:08.864
Okay.

34:24.045 --> 34:26.380
<i>Hi, it's Dylan. You almost got me.</i>

34:26.465 --> 34:29.801
<i>But leave a message
and I'll get back to you soon.</i>

34:31.511 --> 34:33.388
I love you, too.

34:43.690 --> 34:47.819
We are gathered here today
to mourn the loss of Brenda Walsh,

34:47.902 --> 34:52.657
the loving daughter
of Cindy and Jim Walsh,

34:53.449 --> 34:55.201
and to take our SATs.

34:56.161 --> 34:58.204
So you have 30 minutes.

34:58.705 --> 35:02.876
You may open your tests
and begin now.

35:12.093 --> 35:13.636
Hey!

35:23.354 --> 35:26.899
"When I told Brenda I loved her,
I said it out of,

35:26.983 --> 35:30.737
"A. Pity. B. Lust.

35:30.820 --> 35:35.742
"C. Deceit. Or D. Heartfelt emotion."

35:37.827 --> 35:40.663
I can't believe
you have to think about this.

35:44.751 --> 35:48.254
"If Brenda's entire life can be expressed
as a 24-hour day,

35:48.337 --> 35:50.756
"what time will she be forgotten?

35:51.424 --> 35:55.678
"A. 1:00 a.m. B.12:00 noon.

35:56.137 --> 35:58.347
"C. 4:00 p.m.

35:58.431 --> 36:02.727
"Or D. Brenda will never be forgotten."

36:04.687 --> 36:07.148
You're going to forget me by lunchtime?

36:13.654 --> 36:18.701
"The thing I most want Brenda to leave
me in her will is A. Her red pumps.

36:18.784 --> 36:21.954
"B. Her porcelain doll collection.

36:22.538 --> 36:24.915
"C. Her turquoise earrings.

36:25.541 --> 36:27.293
"Or D. Her boyfriend."

36:31.046 --> 36:32.464
Kelly!

36:38.220 --> 36:43.309
"The thing I'll miss most about Brenda
is A. Her sunny personality.

36:43.934 --> 36:47.396
"B. Her sparkling intelligence.

36:47.479 --> 36:52.067
"C. Her quick wit.
Or D. Her help in the kitchen."

36:54.528 --> 36:56.739
Mom, is that all you love me for?

36:56.822 --> 36:59.783
Brenda, wake up.

37:03.370 --> 37:06.081
I just had the weirdest dream.
You were all...

37:07.457 --> 37:08.542
Never mind.

37:08.625 --> 37:11.169
Well, you better get up.
I let you sleep late.

37:11.253 --> 37:13.171
We have to be at the hospital
in an hour.

37:13.255 --> 37:14.506
Okay.

37:15.716 --> 37:18.719
- Hey, Sleeping Beauty.
- Don't keep her. We're late.

37:18.969 --> 37:20.304
So am I.

37:20.387 --> 37:21.972
- Hey.
- Hi.

37:22.389 --> 37:25.726
Hey, I just wanted to tell you
everything's gonna be okay.

37:25.809 --> 37:28.895
- I'll be thinking about you.
- Thanks. I know it will.

37:30.355 --> 37:32.232
So, what time are they gonna do it?

37:32.315 --> 37:35.360
- 10:00. It's not really that big of a deal.
- I know.

37:37.154 --> 37:40.282
- Good luck.
- Hey, good luck to you, too.

37:41.449 --> 37:44.077
What the hell. It's only a test.

37:48.665 --> 37:51.167
- How long will it take?
- About 30 minutes.

37:51.668 --> 37:53.253
- Will there be any pain?
- No.

37:53.336 --> 37:56.589
As I've already told Brenda,
she'll be awake during the procedure.

37:56.673 --> 37:59.175
She'll be given a sedative
and local anesthesia.

37:59.259 --> 38:02.595
Once the lump is removed, we'll
immediately send it down to the lab.

38:02.679 --> 38:04.264
And I'll call you
as soon as we hear anything.

38:04.347 --> 38:07.726
- And how long will that take?
- Two or three hours.

38:07.976 --> 38:10.520
- That's not too bad.
- It's all very routine.

38:10.603 --> 38:12.689
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I should get started.

38:12.772 --> 38:15.066
<i>- Thanks, Doctor.
- Dr Rosen, please call extension 350.</i>

38:15.358 --> 38:18.278
<i>Dr Rosen, please call extension 350.</i>

38:19.028 --> 38:21.030
- Hi, Brenda.
- Hi.

38:21.114 --> 38:24.450
- Feeling drowsy?
- I don't know. I'm too nervous.

38:24.534 --> 38:27.662
- Should we get started?
- Let's do it.

38:27.745 --> 38:29.622
We'll be through before you know it.

38:29.706 --> 38:32.000
Okay, great.
Then we're ready to start the procedure.

38:33.668 --> 38:35.461
- I'm so nervous.
- Sit down.

38:39.716 --> 38:41.509
All right, take your seats.

38:41.592 --> 38:44.095
We're going to begin in two minutes.

38:49.934 --> 38:51.853
- Wait!
- Look,

38:51.936 --> 38:53.980
- about what happened the other night...
- It's okay.

38:54.063 --> 38:57.024
You don't have to say anything.
It was just one of those things.

38:57.108 --> 39:00.444
Yeah. It was just one of those things.
We don't have to tell anybody, right?

39:00.528 --> 39:01.571
No.

39:01.654 --> 39:03.531
We wouldn't make a good couple,
anyway, Andrea.

39:03.614 --> 39:06.075
Terrible. The worst couple. Horrible.

39:06.367 --> 39:09.495
If you two lovebirds are through,
we'd like to begin.

39:15.751 --> 39:17.378
- Lovebirds?
- Lovebirds?

39:23.092 --> 39:24.677
Do you feel anything?

39:26.720 --> 39:28.806
Is this going to leave any scars?

39:28.889 --> 39:33.853
No, because the incision is very small.
The stitch won't even have to come out.

39:35.020 --> 39:37.523
When I'm through,
I'm gonna apply a pressure bandage,

39:37.606 --> 39:39.275
and that's gonna prevent
the blood and fluids

39:39.358 --> 39:41.569
from collecting at the biopsy site.

39:41.652 --> 39:44.154
You're gonna have to keep the tape
across your chest.

39:44.238 --> 39:47.866
And it has to stay dry.
So, no showers for two days.

39:47.950 --> 39:51.161
- For two days?
- Afraid not.

39:56.417 --> 39:59.461
- How's it going?
- Very well.

40:00.087 --> 40:01.755
I've found the lump.

40:02.256 --> 40:04.633
I'm just gonna remove the whole thing.

40:04.842 --> 40:06.343
What does it look like?

40:06.426 --> 40:09.179
Kind of like
a little piece of chewed gum.

40:09.721 --> 40:11.181
That's disgusting.

40:29.074 --> 40:31.702
After Sheila died, I didn't think I'd see
the inside of a hospital

40:31.785 --> 40:33.161
for a long time.

40:34.246 --> 40:36.915
These waiting rooms, they are so awful.

40:37.499 --> 40:40.293
Only when you're waiting for bad news.

40:40.752 --> 40:42.796
I've never had it any other way.

40:43.255 --> 40:45.257
Well, you will this time.

40:45.757 --> 40:47.134
I hope.

40:48.343 --> 40:51.346
Yeah. You know, Cindy,

40:52.722 --> 40:55.475
what happened to your sister
was a tragedy.

40:56.226 --> 40:58.979
She was young, intelligent, beautiful.

40:59.562 --> 41:01.481
She didn't deserve to die.

41:01.564 --> 41:04.526
But you've gotta stop
trying to make Brenda's biopsy

41:04.609 --> 41:07.529
into some bad rerun
of Sheila's entire illness.

41:07.612 --> 41:12.242
- It's not the same thing.
- Jim, aren't you scared?

41:12.575 --> 41:17.288
No. Not until I hear there's something
to be scared about. Then I'll be scared.

41:19.374 --> 41:21.960
Mom? Dad? Hey, guys.

41:22.043 --> 41:24.212
Brandon, what on earth
are you doing here?

41:24.295 --> 41:26.005
- What happened to the test?
- Are you kidding me?

41:26.089 --> 41:28.800
I couldn't even think with Brenda
going through all this. I'm telling you,

41:28.883 --> 41:31.427
this is a deliberate plan on her part
to mess with my concentration.

41:31.511 --> 41:33.555
- Can you make it up?
- Yeah.

41:33.638 --> 41:35.890
They said under the circumstances,
absolutely.

41:35.974 --> 41:37.892
- I'm glad you're here.
- So am I.

41:37.976 --> 41:39.811
- Hey, Brenda!
- Hey, baby.

41:39.894 --> 41:42.021
Brandon, what are you doing?
What about your SAT?

41:42.105 --> 41:44.816
I bagged them.
I couldn't stop worrying about you.

41:44.899 --> 41:46.526
- How you doing?
- Hey, baby. How did it go?

41:46.609 --> 41:48.111
- How do you feel?
- Fine.

41:48.194 --> 41:51.072
Except for a little dizzy
because I was lying down for so long.

41:51.155 --> 41:54.992
Dr Donner says that we can leave.
She'll call us when we're at home.

41:57.453 --> 41:59.372
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?

41:59.789 --> 42:01.082
My hair's a mess.

42:01.165 --> 42:04.001
I don't know. I think you look terrific.

42:04.418 --> 42:05.503
Dylan!

42:06.671 --> 42:08.589
I went to five hospitals.

42:08.673 --> 42:10.383
You never told me
where you were going.

42:10.466 --> 42:12.426
Home. Come on, baby. Thanks.

42:14.262 --> 42:16.013
Oh, it's good to see you.

42:29.443 --> 42:31.487
Well, it's almost been three hours.

42:31.570 --> 42:33.572
And I'm sure she'll call any minute.

42:33.656 --> 42:36.450
- And when she does, I'll answer it.
- Fine.

42:36.909 --> 42:39.370
Can I get anybody something to eat?

42:39.703 --> 42:41.914
Doesn't anyone know any more jokes?

42:42.248 --> 42:43.290
Dylan?

42:43.832 --> 42:45.751
None that I could tell here.

42:51.840 --> 42:52.967
Hello?

42:53.509 --> 42:55.260
Honey, it's the doorbell.

42:56.261 --> 43:00.099
- See, I told you she'd answer it.
- I'm sorry, it won't happen again.

43:02.976 --> 43:04.686
You guys, I'm not dead.

43:05.687 --> 43:07.648
- Are you okay?
- Are you all right?

43:07.731 --> 43:10.234
I don't know yet. We're waiting to hear.

43:13.028 --> 43:17.115
Brenda, I'm sorry about the other day.
I didn't know what to say.

43:17.199 --> 43:19.117
I didn't know how to react.

43:19.576 --> 43:21.745
Will you guys just give me a hug?

43:24.039 --> 43:27.251
Excuse me. I want to get that.
I'll get it! I'll get it.

43:30.545 --> 43:31.755
Hello?

43:32.631 --> 43:34.174
Yes, this is Brenda.

43:35.467 --> 43:37.094
Hi, Dr Donner.

43:48.438 --> 43:51.650
- It is?
- Oh, thank God.

43:52.442 --> 43:55.654
It's fibroadenoma just like she thought.
Fairly common in teenage girls

43:55.737 --> 43:58.406
due to an abnormally high level
of estrogen.

43:58.740 --> 44:02.410
- I guess my hormones are raging.
- Tell me about it.

44:03.995 --> 44:05.622
Yes, I'm still here.

44:05.956 --> 44:08.208
I feel fine. Hardly any pain at all.

44:09.000 --> 44:12.045
I promise I won't for two whole days.

44:12.545 --> 44:16.174
Okay. Thank you, Dr Donner. Bye-bye.

44:35.360 --> 44:36.402
Brenda?

44:39.572 --> 44:41.032
Were you sleeping?

44:41.616 --> 44:42.742
No.

44:46.079 --> 44:49.207
You know, you gave us all
a pretty good scare.

44:49.415 --> 44:50.458
I know.

44:50.792 --> 44:53.586
- And imagine how I felt.
- I did.

44:56.214 --> 44:58.257
It must have been pretty awful.

45:00.051 --> 45:02.428
But it was pretty terrible for me, too.

45:03.429 --> 45:04.597
Why?

45:06.390 --> 45:08.142
Thinking about losing you.

45:10.228 --> 45:12.939
I don't think you know
how much I'd miss you.

45:14.357 --> 45:16.692
I think I have a pretty good idea.

45:20.154 --> 45:21.614
Good night, Bren.

45:30.206 --> 45:34.919
- Don't you ever do that to me again.
- I won't. I promise.
