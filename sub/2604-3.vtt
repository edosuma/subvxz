00:13.946 --> 00:17.248
Hello?

00:17.316 --> 00:20.952
I am armed...

00:21.020 --> 00:25.223
with a--
with a big gun.

00:25.291 --> 00:26.991
[Screams]
Oh, my-

00:27.059 --> 00:29.127
- Oh, m--
- God.

00:29.195 --> 00:33.264
At least do it with
a little authority.

00:33.332 --> 00:35.633
Someone's going to think
I raised a pussy.

00:35.701 --> 00:38.436
[Groans]
You scared the crap out of me.

00:38.504 --> 00:39.671
How did you get here?

00:39.738 --> 00:42.373
I live in a nursing home,
not a prison.

00:42.441 --> 00:44.542
They have a shuttle service

00:44.610 --> 00:47.412
and a very muscular driver
named Donald.

00:47.479 --> 00:49.280
Grammy, I'm making
a lot of money right now.

00:49.348 --> 00:50.548
I could have sent
a car for you.

00:50.616 --> 00:51.816
Then,
I wouldn't have gotten

00:51.884 --> 00:55.286
to see a very muscular driver
named Donald.

00:55.354 --> 00:59.424
Why didn't you call?
I could have been here.

01:02.261 --> 01:06.664
Oh, my God.

01:06.732 --> 01:10.335
Our dinner.

01:10.402 --> 01:14.405
I have been working so hard,
I forgot what day it is.

01:14.473 --> 01:16.774
[Sighs]

01:16.842 --> 01:20.845
That used to happen to dad.

01:20.913 --> 01:25.950
That's what happens when
you care about your job.

01:26.018 --> 01:29.220
And don't give a rat's ass
about your grandmother.

01:29.288 --> 01:32.290
Well, yeah, that is why
I put you in the home.

01:36.528 --> 01:38.363
Good morning, everyone.

01:38.430 --> 01:40.965
Before we get down to business,
I would like to offer

01:41.033 --> 01:46.971
a big welcome back
to Daniel Hardman.

01:48.040 --> 01:49.340
We're thrilled to have you home.

01:49.408 --> 01:50.875
- Now, moving on--
- I'm sorry, Jessica.

01:50.943 --> 01:52.710
Before you do that,
I want to say one thing.

01:52.778 --> 01:54.746
While I am delighted
to be back,

01:54.813 --> 01:56.314
I want to be clear.
Nothing's changing.

01:56.382 --> 01:58.049
Jessica is still the head
of this firm.

01:58.117 --> 02:00.652
I'm here in
a number two capacity.

02:00.719 --> 02:04.022
Just think of me like
a seasoned advisor.

02:04.089 --> 02:06.791
Like Bill to Hillary
if she'd won.

02:06.859 --> 02:07.926
[Laughing quietly]

02:07.993 --> 02:11.429
Thank you, Daniel.
Moving on.

02:11.497 --> 02:15.633
Prescott hospitals' negotiation
with their nurses' union.

02:15.701 --> 02:17.602
Nobody wants a strike.

02:17.670 --> 02:19.337
I'm going to need someone
who's going to bring this home.

02:19.405 --> 02:20.672
Therefore--
Not to jump in here too quick,

02:20.739 --> 02:22.707
but I did bring Prescott
into the firm.

02:22.775 --> 02:24.442
I'm your man.

02:24.510 --> 02:26.311
What I was going to say is
I brought Harvey up to speed

02:26.378 --> 02:27.812
on this last night.

02:27.880 --> 02:29.714
He's got it covered.
Been prepping all morning.

02:29.782 --> 02:31.449
Really?
The whole morning?

02:31.517 --> 02:33.084
I learn fast.

02:33.152 --> 02:34.085
Maybe I could still help.
Mind if I take a look?

02:34.153 --> 02:35.486
Later.

02:35.554 --> 02:37.722
Jessica likes to keep
these meetings headlines only.

02:37.790 --> 02:39.090
I'll swing by your office.

02:39.158 --> 02:42.827
- Sounds like a plan.
- Next order of business.

02:45.798 --> 02:47.732
Nurses' strike assigned
to me last night?

02:47.800 --> 02:49.901
Goddamn Daniel.

02:49.969 --> 02:51.302
Picked up right
where he left off.

02:51.370 --> 02:54.205
Trying to cut my legs out.

02:54.273 --> 02:55.306
Why are you grinning?

02:55.374 --> 02:56.541
I'm just glad to have someone

02:56.608 --> 02:58.776
in the room who pisses you off
more than I do.

02:58.844 --> 03:00.044
You know why I picked you,
right?

03:00.112 --> 03:01.412
Because you knew
I'd roll with your lie.

03:01.480 --> 03:04.615
Because you need a chance to
get out of the doghouse.

03:04.683 --> 03:06.784
I got your tea service
for you.

03:06.852 --> 03:08.219
You think that's going
to cut it?

03:08.287 --> 03:11.389
- What do you want me to do?
- Put him in his place.

03:14.360 --> 03:16.127
Ahh! It's a can opener.
What?

03:16.195 --> 03:17.662
Paying for your sins
of last night?

03:17.730 --> 03:19.430
[Groans]

03:19.498 --> 03:21.566
I wish you hadn't said that.
Why not?

03:21.633 --> 03:23.301
'Cause I spent the night
with my grandmother.

03:23.369 --> 03:26.204
- Is she hot?
- What is wrong with you?

03:26.271 --> 03:28.573
- You started it.
- I most certainly did not.

03:28.640 --> 03:29.640
Prescott Hospital.

03:29.708 --> 03:30.675
I need a complete summary

03:30.743 --> 03:32.777
of their nurses'
union negotiation.

03:32.845 --> 03:35.780
From whom?

03:37.616 --> 03:38.549
Rachel?

03:38.617 --> 03:40.718
No. No, it's too soon.
I--

03:40.786 --> 03:42.787
I broke it off
before we even started. No.

03:42.855 --> 03:43.888
Tell her about
the exciting night

03:43.956 --> 03:45.289
you spent with
your grandmother.

03:45.357 --> 03:46.424
Trust me.

03:46.492 --> 03:47.792
She'll realize she dodged
a bullet.

03:47.860 --> 03:49.193
Oh.

03:49.261 --> 03:51.362
And I need four bullshit
pro bono cases right now.

03:51.430 --> 03:53.364
I don't have
any pro bono files.

03:53.432 --> 03:57.702
I'm a corporate lawyer.
That's what we do here.

04:00.172 --> 04:01.372
I do it on my own time.

04:01.440 --> 04:03.841
- Thanks, Rachel.
- Wait a minute.

04:03.909 --> 04:06.377
Why are you asking me
for case files?

04:06.445 --> 04:08.279
I'm not allowed to say.

04:08.347 --> 04:10.114
Harvey asked Mike,
and he was too afraid?

04:10.182 --> 04:12.817
Like a baby girl.

04:12.885 --> 04:14.118
You okay?
No.

04:14.186 --> 04:15.486
But I am too busy
to do anything

04:15.554 --> 04:16.521
other than throw myself

04:16.588 --> 04:17.988
into this stack
of work anyhow.

04:18.057 --> 04:19.089
Well...

04:19.158 --> 04:20.925
as long as you're making
healthy choices.

04:20.993 --> 04:23.361
Yeah.

04:25.564 --> 04:26.731
Make yourself at home.

04:26.799 --> 04:28.866
You know, I can see myself
in this thing.

04:28.934 --> 04:32.003
I would find that really
distracting, of course.

04:32.071 --> 04:33.771
I'm swooning.

04:33.839 --> 04:36.307
I thought the plan was to meet
in your office.

04:36.375 --> 04:39.644
I thought I'd save us
some time.

04:39.711 --> 04:41.112
This is a child custody
dispute.

04:41.180 --> 04:43.214
Little Lenny.
So sad.

04:43.282 --> 04:44.982
You need props to
make your point?

04:45.050 --> 04:46.217
You said you changed.

04:46.285 --> 04:48.152
Why don't you prove it
by doing some good?

04:48.220 --> 04:49.620
Harvey, I have changed.

04:49.688 --> 04:52.890
But I don't have to prove
anything to you.

04:52.958 --> 04:55.426
Not as long as
you sit in this office

04:55.494 --> 04:57.195
and pretend to practice law.

04:57.262 --> 04:59.430
But when you stick your nose
in my cases,

04:59.498 --> 05:00.932
that's another story.

05:00.999 --> 05:03.334
If you haven't noticed,
my name is on the door.

05:03.402 --> 05:04.735
They're all my cases.

05:04.803 --> 05:06.838
The name of this firm is
Pearson Hardman.

05:06.905 --> 05:08.439
You said it yourself,
you're number two.

05:08.507 --> 05:09.841
I answer to number one.

05:09.908 --> 05:11.442
No matter who you answer to,

05:11.510 --> 05:13.578
one way or another,

05:13.645 --> 05:16.914
you will learn to treat me
with respect.

05:16.982 --> 05:19.617
Fine.

05:19.685 --> 05:22.820
I respect you,
but I don't work for you.

05:22.888 --> 05:24.856
And I sure as hell
don't work <i>with</i> you.

05:24.923 --> 05:27.992
Pick up the phone.
Little Lenny deserves the best.

06:11.653 --> 06:12.686
You know the head
of the nurses' union

06:12.754 --> 06:14.588
isn't a lawyer but a nurse,
right?

06:14.656 --> 06:15.756
What's your point?

06:15.824 --> 06:17.625
What if you get schooled
by a hot nurse?

06:17.692 --> 06:19.026
What are you, 12?

06:19.094 --> 06:20.527
What, you can talk about
my grandmother,

06:20.595 --> 06:23.197
but I can't make a nurse joke?
Yup.

06:23.264 --> 06:24.365
Actually, I was 12

06:24.432 --> 06:25.966
when I had my first
caregiver fantasy.

06:26.034 --> 06:27.401
Let me guess.
Nurse Ratched.

06:27.469 --> 06:28.502
Say what you will.

06:28.570 --> 06:29.803
You had a kind
of stocky hotness.

06:29.871 --> 06:31.905
Listen, our goal
is to reach a fair agreement

06:31.973 --> 06:33.374
between a hospital
and its nurses.

06:33.441 --> 06:34.708
There are no winners.

06:34.776 --> 06:37.411
Did you have a stroke?
There's always a winner.

06:37.479 --> 06:39.446
Of course there's a winner.

06:39.514 --> 06:40.648
Just needed to make sure

06:40.715 --> 06:43.017
you were ready to stick it
to the nurses.

06:43.084 --> 06:45.119
Don't say it.

06:47.689 --> 06:51.558
Ah.
Negotiator number five.

06:51.626 --> 06:54.561
Meet the new boss.
Same as the old boss.

06:54.629 --> 06:57.164
Jameson was our last
negotiator. Trust me.

06:57.232 --> 06:58.499
I'm not Jameson.

06:58.566 --> 06:59.833
That's what he said about
the one before him.

06:59.901 --> 07:01.268
You're all the same to me.

07:01.336 --> 07:03.704
I'm over here,
you're over here.

07:03.772 --> 07:06.407
Well,
let's see if we can't--

07:06.474 --> 07:09.443
You're going to have
to buy me dinner first.

07:09.511 --> 07:11.211
I can do better.

07:11.279 --> 07:13.280
You're expecting me
to offer you this.

07:13.348 --> 07:15.516
You're willing to settle
on this.

07:15.583 --> 07:16.617
You're praying for this.

07:16.685 --> 07:21.255
Well, your prayers have
been answered.

07:21.322 --> 07:23.524
You know, I'll even buy you
breakfast in the morning.

07:23.591 --> 07:25.259
Not so fast, blondie.

07:25.326 --> 07:28.362
Prescott Hospitals is hurting
as much as anyone else.

07:28.430 --> 07:29.730
You push any harder,

07:29.798 --> 07:31.598
they're going to go out
of business, and nobody wins.

07:31.666 --> 07:33.000
This is the best
you're going to do.

07:33.068 --> 07:37.171
And it's a deal
you're ready to take.

07:37.238 --> 07:38.639
We <i>were</i> ready.

07:38.707 --> 07:41.809
But what about the new account
you funded yesterday?

07:41.876 --> 07:43.477
Yeah, that's right.
I know about it.

07:43.545 --> 07:45.145
This isn't my first rodeo.

07:45.213 --> 07:47.314
Then you also know that
money's off the table.

07:47.382 --> 07:49.550
Money's fungible.
Everything's on the table.

07:49.617 --> 07:51.018
I'm sorry,

07:51.086 --> 07:53.287
but that account was funded
by donors specifically

07:53.354 --> 07:55.489
for the development
of new robotics for surgery.

07:55.557 --> 07:58.225
I used to change bedpans
for a living, junior.

07:58.293 --> 08:00.494
I know what bullshit
smells like.

08:00.562 --> 08:01.562
This isn't bullshit.

08:01.629 --> 08:02.629
Even if Prescott wanted

08:02.697 --> 08:04.398
to give that money
to the nurses,

08:04.466 --> 08:06.834
they couldn't, legally.

08:06.901 --> 08:07.835
So they're willing
to raise money

08:07.902 --> 08:09.336
for equipment
but not nurses?

08:09.404 --> 08:10.571
I get it.

08:10.638 --> 08:14.074
Nurses are sexy,
but nurses aren't sexy.

08:14.142 --> 08:16.610
Well, you need to find a way
to get us access to that money,

08:16.678 --> 08:18.846
or we don't have a deal.

08:18.913 --> 08:20.247
That's not going to happen.

08:20.315 --> 08:21.448
Well, then we're done.

08:21.516 --> 08:24.518
You leave this table,
it means only one thing.

08:24.586 --> 08:26.520
I know exactly
what it means.

08:26.588 --> 08:28.722
We have
a fully funded strike fund,

08:28.790 --> 08:30.457
and we're going to use it.

08:30.525 --> 08:33.460
We reject your proposal.

08:38.767 --> 08:43.370
Reminder: Ask Harold
to dye his hair.

08:43.438 --> 08:44.872
Orange is the color
of a clown.

08:44.939 --> 08:47.508
No, strike that.
Harold is a clown.

08:51.913 --> 08:54.114
Annual survey
of associates came out.

08:54.182 --> 08:57.351
Pearson Hardman ranked second
to last in quality of life.

08:57.418 --> 08:59.386
Who beat us?

08:59.454 --> 09:00.587
Louis, I know you
take great pride

09:00.655 --> 09:02.556
in making the associates' lives
miserable--

09:02.624 --> 09:04.892
Well, I did until the survey
said I was second best at it.

09:04.959 --> 09:05.893
You're missing the point.

09:05.960 --> 09:07.494
Harvard wants to rescind

09:07.562 --> 09:10.097
our on-campus
recruiting privileges.

09:10.165 --> 09:12.266
What?

09:12.333 --> 09:15.869
Wait.
Pearson Hardman is Harvard.

09:15.937 --> 09:17.704
Harvard
is Pearson Hardman.

09:17.772 --> 09:19.973
One can't survive
without the other.

09:20.041 --> 09:21.375
There's no need
for histrionics just yet.

09:21.442 --> 09:23.510
Histrionics?

09:23.578 --> 09:25.078
This is the gravest day
I've ever known.

09:25.146 --> 09:28.849
Jessica,
let me handle this.

09:28.917 --> 09:31.885
Why do you think
I'm here?

09:31.953 --> 09:33.387
Screw you.

09:33.454 --> 09:37.024
Mine likes
to be scolded too.

09:37.091 --> 09:38.492
I keep getting
these dating site pop-ups.

09:38.560 --> 09:41.361
It's like my computer's
accusing me of being single.

09:41.429 --> 09:43.096
Do you know
why it's doing that?

09:43.164 --> 09:44.298
My mother's in there?

09:44.365 --> 09:45.499
Did you search for
a dating site?

09:45.567 --> 09:47.034
- No.
- When?

09:47.101 --> 09:48.735
Last week.

09:48.803 --> 09:52.005
You, me, happy hour,
Harvey's corporate card.

09:52.073 --> 09:53.106
Are you crazy?

09:53.174 --> 09:54.474
You want to leave the office
at 5:00?

09:54.542 --> 09:55.742
[Laughs]
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

09:55.810 --> 09:58.912
Happy hour starts at 4:00.
- [Giggles]

09:58.980 --> 10:00.247
It's a bad idea.

10:00.315 --> 10:01.315
You're never going to get
an injunction to stop

10:01.382 --> 10:02.649
the strike outright.

10:02.717 --> 10:03.951
You read that in a book,

10:04.018 --> 10:05.152
or is that what
your five minutes

10:05.220 --> 10:06.453
practicing law have to say?

10:06.521 --> 10:08.388
Not a book
but every labor decision

10:08.456 --> 10:09.857
from the last ten years.

10:09.924 --> 10:11.892
But I'm telling you,
it's a safer bet

10:11.960 --> 10:13.560
arguing for the temporary
restraining order.

10:13.628 --> 10:16.029
First of all,
a T.R.O. delays a strike,

10:16.097 --> 10:18.165
an injunction stops it,
and I want to stop it.

10:18.233 --> 10:19.499
Second of all...
[Elevator bell dings]

10:19.567 --> 10:21.235
never use that phrase
"safer bet" with me again.

10:22.637 --> 10:24.872
- Safer bet.
- You know what?

10:24.939 --> 10:27.808
You don't deserve the privilege
of seeing me win.

10:30.545 --> 10:32.946
I've gathered you all here
to ask you

10:33.014 --> 10:35.115
just one simple question.

10:35.183 --> 10:37.050
Do any of you
have the desire

10:37.118 --> 10:41.054
to strip down and exchange
underwear with each other?

10:41.122 --> 10:42.956
Any takers?

10:43.024 --> 10:44.191
No?

10:44.259 --> 10:45.492
Well, of course not
because you don't want

10:45.560 --> 10:47.628
to air your dirty laundry
in public, right?

10:47.695 --> 10:50.264
But evidently,
you did.

10:50.331 --> 10:52.366
And while I'm personally proud
of the fact

10:52.433 --> 10:54.968
that you're all unhappy,
Harvard is not.

10:55.036 --> 10:57.738
So I've invited a representative
from the law school

10:57.805 --> 11:00.641
to see firsthand
how joyful you all are

11:00.708 --> 11:01.975
under my tutelage.

11:02.043 --> 11:04.745
So you want us to lie?

11:04.812 --> 11:06.880
No.

11:06.948 --> 11:08.715
I want you to convince
this woman

11:08.783 --> 11:14.121
that Pearson Hardman makes you
shit rainbows.

11:14.188 --> 11:16.089
Is that clear?
Yeah.

11:16.157 --> 11:18.358
- You sure? Okay.
- [Whispers] Yeah.

11:18.426 --> 11:23.263
Anyone else have
any other stupid questions?

11:40.348 --> 11:41.949
What are you
doing here?

11:42.016 --> 11:44.184
I'm here on behalf
of Pearson Hardman.

11:44.252 --> 11:46.086
As much as I appreciate
a fan club,

11:46.154 --> 11:47.621
this hearing starts
in five minutes,

11:47.689 --> 11:49.056
which means you've got four
minutes to get out of here.

11:49.123 --> 11:50.557
Daniel.

11:50.625 --> 11:53.226
I'm prepared to rule on
your motion.

11:53.294 --> 11:56.263
What do you think
it's going to be?

11:56.331 --> 11:58.832
T.R.O. granted.

11:58.900 --> 12:00.133
Finally,
you rule one for me.

12:00.201 --> 12:02.235
Don't give me any grief
about the Feinberg suit.

12:02.303 --> 12:05.906
Your precedents sucked.
This one's legit.

12:05.974 --> 12:07.574
It's good to
have you back, Daniel.

12:07.642 --> 12:11.778
Thank you for moving me up
on the docket, Judge.

12:18.086 --> 12:20.554
- What the hell was that?
- I believe it was a victory.

12:20.621 --> 12:22.689
Hey, you don't reschedule
my hearings.

12:22.757 --> 12:24.191
Were you in there?

12:24.258 --> 12:25.792
'Cause I do.

12:25.860 --> 12:27.094
The truth is
you should be thanking me.

12:27.161 --> 12:28.161
Well, would you like me

12:28.229 --> 12:29.496
to thank your face
with my fist?

12:29.564 --> 12:31.465
If you would have consulted
with me first,

12:31.532 --> 12:33.700
like I offered,
I could have told you

12:33.768 --> 12:37.170
Garvin Steiner was never going
to grant an injunction.

12:37.238 --> 12:38.305
Not when his Wednesday
golf buddy shows up

12:38.373 --> 12:39.873
and hijacks the courtroom.

12:39.941 --> 12:41.208
Say what you will.
I know the man.

12:41.275 --> 12:42.909
0% chance he gives you
what you want.

12:42.977 --> 12:44.511
Daniel,
maybe you don't know

12:44.579 --> 12:45.879
how it works these days.

12:45.947 --> 12:47.180
When I'm on a case,

12:47.248 --> 12:49.049
the only thing
there's 0% chance of

12:49.117 --> 12:50.384
is me losing.

12:50.451 --> 12:52.652
Harvey,
I said I've changed.

12:52.720 --> 12:54.955
Don't mistake that change
for weakness.

12:55.023 --> 12:56.823
I told you,
my name's on the door.

12:56.891 --> 13:00.227
Didn't get there by me taking
shit from the likes of you.

13:00.294 --> 13:01.728
You want to work together
on this,

13:01.796 --> 13:03.230
I'm open to it.

13:03.297 --> 13:04.398
You don't,

13:04.465 --> 13:06.233
this is how
it's going to be.

13:20.762 --> 13:22.530
So let me
get this straight.

13:22.597 --> 13:25.132
The judge ruled
against your idea,

13:25.200 --> 13:26.267
and so you went
with my idea?

13:26.334 --> 13:29.136
Not exactly.
Hardman got the T.R.O.

13:29.204 --> 13:31.772
Okay, so you told me
I was wrong,

13:31.840 --> 13:34.675
and yet I had the same idea
as a managing partner.

13:34.743 --> 13:36.243
That's funny, that kind of
makes me wonder

13:36.311 --> 13:37.344
what else you've been
wrong about.

13:37.412 --> 13:38.546
Hiring you?

13:38.613 --> 13:40.981
Daniel and I wouldn't
concur with that.

13:41.049 --> 13:42.116
Hey, handsome.

13:42.184 --> 13:44.952
Your bearded buddy
was already here.

13:45.020 --> 13:47.321
You can shut us down
for 48 hours,

13:47.389 --> 13:49.190
but we can still prepare
to strike.

13:49.257 --> 13:53.461
Actually, I came over
to extend an olive branch.

13:53.528 --> 13:55.596
Why don't you go ahead and
start your strike right now?

13:55.664 --> 13:58.299
You looked into our finances,
I looked into yours.

13:58.366 --> 14:00.334
Your strike fund has enough
to last a week.

14:00.402 --> 14:02.670
We're not even going to have
a meeting about it for a month.

14:02.738 --> 14:04.305
We know what
we're getting into.

14:04.372 --> 14:06.107
We're prepared.

14:06.174 --> 14:07.208
Well, prepare yourself
for this:

14:07.275 --> 14:09.176
Our last offer's off the table.

14:09.244 --> 14:11.812
The new offer is the one
we gave you before that.

14:11.880 --> 14:12.980
And every day you strike,

14:13.048 --> 14:17.151
it's going
to keep getting worse.

14:17.219 --> 14:18.853
Harvey, you do realize
you just littered, right?

14:18.920 --> 14:21.155
They can pick it up.
They're not working.

14:21.223 --> 14:22.823
It'll give them
a sense of purpose.

14:22.891 --> 14:24.091
Wow.

14:24.159 --> 14:25.926
You don't think you're being
a little harsh?

14:25.994 --> 14:27.528
I just put an end
to a situation

14:27.596 --> 14:30.598
our client can't afford
and those nurses can't either.

14:30.665 --> 14:32.666
Trust me,
they'll cave.

14:34.770 --> 14:36.470
Everyone.

14:36.538 --> 14:37.838
I would like you to meet

14:37.906 --> 14:41.108
Ms. Sheila Zass from
our beloved Harvard Law.

14:41.176 --> 14:43.511
While I appreciate
the introduction,

14:43.578 --> 14:44.578
I would have appreciated
even more

14:44.646 --> 14:46.046
a little discretion.

14:46.114 --> 14:47.982
I'm here to make
an assessment,

14:48.049 --> 14:49.950
which would have been aided
by anonymity.

14:50.018 --> 14:51.519
Fly.
Wall.

14:51.586 --> 14:52.586
Loud and clear.

14:52.654 --> 14:53.587
And by the way,

14:53.655 --> 14:56.223
it's Sazs.
S-a-z-s.

14:56.291 --> 14:58.359
Yeah, that's what I said.
Sheila Zass.

14:58.426 --> 14:59.860
Never mind.

14:59.928 --> 15:01.195
Do you see what I see?

15:01.263 --> 15:02.563
There's two of them.

15:02.631 --> 15:05.833
I think Louis is attracted
to female Louis.

15:05.901 --> 15:06.901
Do you think that
if they touch,

15:06.968 --> 15:08.102
the world would cease
to exist?

15:08.170 --> 15:09.770
I don't want to think
about them touching.

15:09.838 --> 15:10.771
There's my favorite
litigation girl.

15:10.839 --> 15:11.939
Olivia, what's up?

15:12.007 --> 15:14.375
James, Gordon brief,
just going to say,

15:14.442 --> 15:15.543
it was a gift to the law.

15:15.610 --> 15:17.111
See, this is what I like to do,
basically.

15:17.179 --> 15:18.245
I like to, uh, you know,
sit here

15:18.313 --> 15:19.613
once a week,
make myself accessible,

15:19.681 --> 15:20.714
get to know the troops

15:20.782 --> 15:22.750
on a, you know, personal level.
Okay.

15:22.818 --> 15:26.220
And what has
that process yielded?

15:26.288 --> 15:29.290
Well,
Harold has a mother...

15:29.357 --> 15:30.991
Aunt.

15:31.059 --> 15:33.060
Who tragically died
of heart disease.

15:33.128 --> 15:34.261
Cancer.

15:34.329 --> 15:37.264
We're all with him.

15:37.332 --> 15:38.599
I think I've seen enough.

15:38.667 --> 15:41.635
Clearly, you don't know
that person very well.

15:41.703 --> 15:42.636
So unless you want
to find yourself

15:42.704 --> 15:44.705
recruiting
SUNY Binghamton,

15:44.773 --> 15:46.974
you'll treat me with
a little more respect.

15:47.042 --> 15:48.576
Wow, you really cut me
to the quick.

15:48.643 --> 15:51.212
Yes, I do not know him
on a personal level, thank God.

15:51.279 --> 15:54.014
But I don't think
that's relevant.

15:54.082 --> 15:55.716
I have 20 underlings.

15:55.784 --> 15:58.052
I don't know
a single person's last name.

15:58.119 --> 15:59.687
God, I admire you.

15:59.754 --> 16:02.623
What do you need from us
to keep our privileges?

16:02.691 --> 16:04.158
What do you think I need?

16:04.226 --> 16:05.159
Talk to each one of them
individually.

16:05.227 --> 16:06.160
Bingo.
Pick a man.

16:06.228 --> 16:09.029
That one.

16:10.732 --> 16:12.399
What the hell
is wrong with you?

16:12.467 --> 16:14.969
People say
I'm emotionally unavailable.

16:15.036 --> 16:16.770
I got us 48 hours,
and you threw it away.

16:16.838 --> 16:17.872
No.

16:17.939 --> 16:19.406
You gave them two days
to negotiate

16:19.474 --> 16:21.809
with the threat of a strike
hanging over our heads.

16:21.877 --> 16:25.112
I took the only bullet they had
out of the chamber.

16:25.180 --> 16:27.047
And now that bullet
is headed right at us.

16:27.115 --> 16:28.515
They have an offer in front
of them,

16:28.583 --> 16:29.617
and they're going
to sign it.

16:29.684 --> 16:31.085
- You don't know that.
- Yes, I do.

16:31.152 --> 16:33.420
Well, you better be right
because if either one of us

16:33.488 --> 16:35.823
picks up the phone right now,
we'll be the ones who caved.

16:35.891 --> 16:36.824
Then we might as well
tell them

16:36.892 --> 16:37.858
they can have everything.

16:37.926 --> 16:39.226
Finally,
we're on the same page.

16:39.294 --> 16:41.528
Welcome to the team.
We're not on the same page.

16:41.596 --> 16:43.764
You backed us into a corner.

16:43.832 --> 16:44.932
I didn't do shit.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.634
Nell Sawyer put us
into that position.

16:46.701 --> 16:48.569
I gave her the best offer
we could afford.

16:48.637 --> 16:51.071
And if this strike drags on,
Prescott goes down.

16:51.139 --> 16:53.207
And none of us
can afford that.

16:53.275 --> 16:54.742
This strike never
would have happened

16:54.809 --> 16:57.177
in the first place if
I had gotten an injunction

16:57.245 --> 16:58.512
instead of the T.R.O.

16:58.580 --> 17:00.981
By the way,
that piece of genius,

17:01.049 --> 17:02.983
same idea
my associate had.

17:03.051 --> 17:04.785
Kid's smart, but he's never
been around the block.

17:04.853 --> 17:07.488
You have.
Stop thinking like a rookie.

17:11.593 --> 17:12.726
[Horn honks]

17:12.794 --> 17:13.961
Okay, let me guess.

17:14.029 --> 17:15.561
The reason that you haven't
signed up yet

17:15.630 --> 17:16.997
is that you want me
to help you

17:17.065 --> 17:19.066
take some sexy pictures
for your profile.

17:19.134 --> 17:21.935
You're hoping that one thing
leads to another and...

17:22.002 --> 17:24.570
♪ Bow-chicka bow-wow

17:24.638 --> 17:25.705
[laughs]
No.

17:25.773 --> 17:27.407
The reason I haven't
signed up yet

17:27.474 --> 17:29.877
is because they have
you fill out this form,

17:29.945 --> 17:33.414
and it asks you to write down
who you are.

17:33.481 --> 17:35.783
And who I am
is a paralegal.

17:35.850 --> 17:37.985
Rachel,
I am a legal secretary,

17:38.053 --> 17:39.119
and I am proud of it.

17:39.187 --> 17:40.454
But when somebody asks me
who I am,

17:40.522 --> 17:42.056
that is not the first thing
that comes to mind.

17:42.123 --> 17:43.691
Yeah, but I don't have
anything else, you know?

17:43.758 --> 17:46.694
I kidded myself about becoming
a lawyer,

17:46.761 --> 17:48.929
and I kidded myself
about Mike.

17:48.997 --> 17:53.133
So the truth is I am just
a lonely paralegal.

17:53.201 --> 17:55.636
And that's a tough thing
to write down.

17:55.704 --> 18:01.008
Well, you're not
a lonely paralegal tonight.

18:01.076 --> 18:04.111
We're lawyers.
Pearson Hardman.

I'm Harriet Specter,
and this is my associate.

18:07.549 --> 18:10.250
Michelle Ross.
I've got a photographic memory.

18:10.318 --> 18:13.620
Pretty much
a legal superhero.

18:13.688 --> 18:15.489
I'm a closer.

18:15.557 --> 18:18.559
I'm the best goddamn closer
this town has ever seen.

18:19.828 --> 18:20.894
What are you looking at?

18:20.962 --> 18:22.596
I can recite
the constitution

18:22.664 --> 18:23.897
forwards, backwards,
and sideways

18:23.965 --> 18:25.632
'cause I read it once
when I was seven.

18:25.700 --> 18:29.503
I don't buy it.
Recite it right now.

18:29.571 --> 18:31.405
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

18:31.473 --> 18:32.539
I'm a flame thrower.

18:32.607 --> 18:34.308
- Surgeon.
- Acrobat.

18:34.376 --> 18:36.310
Professor...
of law.

18:36.378 --> 18:39.847
I'm a Rabbi.
[Clears throat]

18:39.914 --> 18:43.751
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

18:43.818 --> 18:45.419
Oh, my God.
What the hell did you order?

18:53.895 --> 18:56.997
Uh, you wanted to see me,
Mr. Hardman?

18:57.065 --> 18:58.932
Please.
Call me Daniel.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.936
Sit down.

19:03.004 --> 19:05.439
First of all,
I want to tell you

19:05.507 --> 19:07.241
Harvey speaks very highly
of you.

19:07.308 --> 19:09.176
He does?

19:09.244 --> 19:10.344
Well, it's Harvey.

19:10.412 --> 19:12.012
So you have to read
between the lines.

19:12.080 --> 19:13.247
What did he say?

19:13.314 --> 19:14.815
That I'm--
I'm not a complete idiot?

19:14.883 --> 19:16.717
Something like that.

19:16.785 --> 19:18.786
He also told me that
you and I

19:18.853 --> 19:21.755
had the same idea
to go after a T.R.O.

19:21.823 --> 19:23.791
He told me that too.

19:23.858 --> 19:25.426
Why did you think
it was the right move?

19:25.493 --> 19:27.761
It put a clock
on the negotiations

19:27.829 --> 19:29.963
and kept both sides
at the table.

19:30.031 --> 19:31.598
I thought so too.

19:31.666 --> 19:33.834
But whether
I agreed with him

19:33.902 --> 19:35.869
at the time or not,
I'm not going against him now.

19:35.937 --> 19:37.871
But he and I do agree
on this point:

19:37.939 --> 19:39.973
His decision puts us in a bit
of a pickle.

19:40.041 --> 19:41.442
Because we can't go back
to Ms. Sawyer

19:41.509 --> 19:43.644
and ask exactly what she needs
to close the deal.

19:43.711 --> 19:45.746
Harvey and I can't.

19:45.814 --> 19:48.549
But I can.

19:48.616 --> 19:51.652
So you are smart.

19:51.719 --> 19:54.154
I'm afraid so.

19:54.222 --> 19:55.522
You'll have
to forgive me

19:55.590 --> 19:58.058
for not completely trusting
Harvey's assessment,

19:58.126 --> 19:59.960
but I needed
to make sure

20:00.028 --> 20:02.529
that our back channel negotiator
was up to the task.

20:02.597 --> 20:04.531
That's why
he's not here.

20:04.599 --> 20:09.470
Coach doesn't let dad
come to the tryouts.

20:11.773 --> 20:14.274
What do you need me
to do?

20:18.913 --> 20:20.180
They sent you?

20:20.248 --> 20:22.082
Which means they're not serious
about talking.

20:22.150 --> 20:24.218
Ms. Sawyer, please.
Listen to me.

20:24.285 --> 20:25.519
You are on strike,

20:25.587 --> 20:26.987
and they are never
going to flinch.

20:27.055 --> 20:29.289
So what harm is there
in talking to me?

20:29.357 --> 20:31.258
Why should I trust you?

20:31.326 --> 20:34.194
Well, that's why I wanted you
to meet me here.

20:34.262 --> 20:35.762
Nell,

20:35.830 --> 20:38.732
this is my grandmother,
Edith Ross.

20:38.800 --> 20:40.467
Hello.

20:40.535 --> 20:42.236
A proud resident

20:42.303 --> 20:44.571
of a Prescott nursing home.

20:44.639 --> 20:46.440
This is not just
another case for me.

20:46.508 --> 20:47.875
Yeah, and he didn't just
stick me

20:47.942 --> 20:49.576
in here last night
to make that point.

20:49.644 --> 20:51.078
He locked me
in here months ago.

20:51.146 --> 20:52.846
- Grammy.
- Now, easy, Michael.

20:52.914 --> 20:54.781
I'm helping you out here.

20:54.849 --> 20:56.483
By the way,

20:56.551 --> 20:59.853
you're a bit of a hero
to my favorite nurse.

20:59.921 --> 21:03.056
Really?
Well, that's nice to hear.

21:03.124 --> 21:04.258
He never shuts up
about you.

21:04.325 --> 21:06.693
I can't take one pill
in peace.

21:06.761 --> 21:07.794
[Chuckles]

21:07.862 --> 21:09.997
Edith,
I'm glad

21:10.064 --> 21:12.065
you brought up the topic
of pills

21:12.133 --> 21:14.868
because I need to give
your grandson a little lesson.

21:14.936 --> 21:16.670
You mind?
No.

21:16.738 --> 21:17.871
Let's see here.

21:17.939 --> 21:19.840
Plavix, Zestril,

21:19.908 --> 21:21.875
Hygroton, Atenolol.

21:21.943 --> 21:24.178
You know what happens
when they're not kept straight?

21:24.245 --> 21:25.445
Not good.

21:25.513 --> 21:27.981
Who do you think does that?
Doctors?

21:28.049 --> 21:29.550
Nurses.

21:29.617 --> 21:31.718
Imagine
your grandmother's nurse

21:31.786 --> 21:33.887
just finished
a 15-hour shift.

21:33.955 --> 21:37.124
She needs her medicine
in exactly two hours.

21:37.192 --> 21:38.625
We're understaffed.

21:38.693 --> 21:39.960
That nurse is going
to stay.

21:40.028 --> 21:41.929
He won't even sign
a time card for it

21:41.996 --> 21:43.130
because he won't get paid.

21:43.198 --> 21:45.933
But if his name shows up
on this chart,

21:46.000 --> 21:48.468
he stayed.

21:50.004 --> 21:51.238
Happens every day.

21:51.306 --> 21:52.706
You ask me what I want?

21:52.774 --> 21:55.642
I want enough money,
so it never happens again.

22:06.819 --> 22:07.654
That one's a dud.

22:07.655 --> 22:10.790
- You have no idea.
- Mm.

22:10.857 --> 22:11.957
Ms. Sazs.

22:12.025 --> 22:12.991
Mr. Litt.

22:13.059 --> 22:15.093
- Louis.
- Sheila.

22:15.161 --> 22:16.094
I feel as though
I'm talking to a--

22:16.162 --> 22:17.095
Kindred spirit?

22:17.163 --> 22:18.096
- Yes.
- I know.

22:18.164 --> 22:19.631
Me too.

22:19.699 --> 22:20.932
Level with me.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.100
I'll be
brutally honest.

22:22.168 --> 22:23.468
That's the only language
I speak.

22:23.536 --> 22:24.736
I'm going to allow you
to maintain

22:24.804 --> 22:25.871
your recruiting privileges
because of the man

22:25.938 --> 22:27.372
I believe you to be.

22:27.440 --> 22:29.007
And I believe myself
to be that same man.

22:29.075 --> 22:30.475
But you've got
bigger problems.

22:30.543 --> 22:32.544
Your associates
don't respect you.

22:32.612 --> 22:36.982
They think you don't work
as hard as they do.

22:37.050 --> 22:38.183
What?

22:38.251 --> 22:40.419
They think you make them
do your work.

22:43.389 --> 22:45.290
You realize
I'm only telling you this

22:45.358 --> 22:47.192
because I think
that they're wrong.

22:47.260 --> 22:49.961
They are wrong.

22:50.029 --> 22:51.830
Now, if you'll excuse me.

22:58.638 --> 23:00.505
- I did it.
- Did what?

23:00.573 --> 23:04.176
You and Daniel are going
to be so proud of me.

23:04.243 --> 23:06.044
Why don't you let me be
the judge of that?

23:06.112 --> 23:07.245
Judge all you want.

23:07.313 --> 23:10.082
Judge away because I saw Nell
on my own,

23:10.149 --> 23:13.518
even used my grandmother--
not used.

23:13.586 --> 23:15.587
She was onboard with it--
that's weird.

23:15.655 --> 23:16.955
Maintaining your integrity,
I like it.

23:17.023 --> 23:18.023
Continue.

23:18.091 --> 23:19.224
So it turns out

23:19.292 --> 23:20.625
that the nurses are consistently
staying late

23:20.693 --> 23:22.094
to give the patients
the right meds

23:22.161 --> 23:23.595
even though they're not
being paid for it.

23:23.663 --> 23:26.131
- And you bought that?
- Yeah, I bought that.

23:26.199 --> 23:28.200
Because I checked
my grandmother's chart.

23:28.267 --> 23:30.102
If it's true for her,
it's true for others.

23:30.169 --> 23:31.570
Oh, you didn't
let me finish.

23:31.637 --> 23:33.872
Turns out, that all they want
is enough staff

23:33.940 --> 23:35.107
so that nobody ever
has to work

23:35.174 --> 23:36.842
more than
a 15-hour shift again.

23:36.909 --> 23:38.009
And how much is
that going to cost?

23:38.077 --> 23:40.212
10% of the new equipment fund.
Nailed it.

23:40.279 --> 23:41.913
So all we need to do
is find

23:41.981 --> 23:43.482
a legal way to get
at that money.

23:43.549 --> 23:44.750
Yeah, so do you
want me to go

23:44.817 --> 23:46.151
tell Daniel how proud
you are of me,

23:46.219 --> 23:47.953
or do we do that
together later?

23:48.020 --> 23:49.054
Have, like,
a group thing?

23:49.122 --> 23:51.356
I'll give him
the good news.

23:53.393 --> 23:56.061
Wash all you want.
The lies aren't coming off.

23:56.129 --> 23:58.597
I told you I changed.
I didn't say I became a nun.

23:58.664 --> 24:00.699
You lied
to my associate.

24:00.767 --> 24:03.235
I never specifically said
anything that wasn't true.

24:03.302 --> 24:04.403
People hear what
they want to hear.

24:04.470 --> 24:05.670
You deceived your own.

24:05.738 --> 24:09.074
You never lied
to anyone else here?

24:09.142 --> 24:10.876
Jessica,
the other partners, me?

24:10.943 --> 24:12.911
- Not since you've been back.
- Really?

24:12.979 --> 24:14.746
When did Jessica assign you
this case?

24:14.814 --> 24:17.048
You lied to me.

24:17.116 --> 24:20.085
But I didn't come to
the bathroom and cry about it.

24:20.153 --> 24:21.553
No, you sent my associate
to go crying

24:21.621 --> 24:23.955
to the other side.
So he got us a final number.

24:24.023 --> 24:26.158
He got a number,
but it's not going to be final.

24:26.225 --> 24:27.359
We offer them $10 million,

24:27.427 --> 24:29.227
the next day it's going
to be $15 million.

24:29.295 --> 24:31.263
We needed to hold strong
to get them to close.

24:31.330 --> 24:32.431
Says your gut,

24:32.498 --> 24:34.933
and I don't practice law
based on your gut.

24:35.001 --> 24:36.668
My gut didn't burn through
five negotiators.

24:36.736 --> 24:37.969
Nell Sawyer did.

24:38.037 --> 24:39.704
So you think
we should never budge.

24:39.772 --> 24:41.907
I know we should never budge,
but you screwed that

24:41.974 --> 24:43.675
when you sent Mike
to tell them we would.

24:43.743 --> 24:45.076
Congratulations, Daniel.

24:45.144 --> 24:47.045
We may be a couple
of liars,

24:47.113 --> 24:48.413
but only one of us is going
to be responsible

24:48.481 --> 24:50.949
when this whole thing goes
to shit.

25:00.893 --> 25:03.829
You wanted
to see me?

25:05.498 --> 25:07.132
We'll get going
in a minute.

25:07.200 --> 25:09.167
Once I start,
I have to finish.

25:14.140 --> 25:16.208
I've always hated
these things.

25:16.275 --> 25:18.443
A filthy habit.

25:18.511 --> 25:20.111
My daughter
was 15.

25:20.179 --> 25:25.517
I caught her smoking,
and I hit the roof.

25:25.585 --> 25:29.788
But then my wife
got sick.

25:29.856 --> 25:32.858
And then when the cancer
got to her lungs,

25:32.925 --> 25:37.896
once a week,
we would share a cigarette.

25:37.964 --> 25:40.565
Give it the finger.

25:40.633 --> 25:45.136
Monday nights
at 9:00.

25:50.009 --> 25:53.578
I can't stop.

25:53.646 --> 25:58.817
I don't want
to stop.

25:58.885 --> 26:01.119
Uh, we should really
figure out a way

26:01.187 --> 26:02.888
to get at
this equipment fund.

26:02.955 --> 26:04.589
It's going to be
a long night.

26:04.657 --> 26:05.757
That's okay.

26:05.825 --> 26:07.392
I don't really have much
of a social life.

26:07.460 --> 26:09.561
Me either.

26:14.400 --> 26:17.168
Barbaric.

26:17.236 --> 26:19.037
[Dictaphone beeps]

26:19.105 --> 26:20.539
[Exhales]

26:20.606 --> 26:23.408
Norma, the Scofield subpoena
is missing

26:23.476 --> 26:25.677
an entire class
of subcontracts.

26:25.745 --> 26:26.745
Please amend it

26:26.812 --> 26:29.881
to include anything
after 2010.

26:29.949 --> 26:33.552
Oh, and send Sheila
a basket of flowers.

26:33.619 --> 26:36.354
Thank-you flowers,
not romantic flowers.

26:36.422 --> 26:38.957
Let things take
their natural course.

26:39.025 --> 26:40.058
Can't you just
keep a diary

26:40.126 --> 26:43.995
like every other
12-year-old girl?

26:44.063 --> 26:45.931
Not tonight,
Harvey.

26:45.998 --> 26:49.601
Just go home.

26:49.669 --> 26:52.370
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

26:52.438 --> 26:55.106
I'm just catching up
on some work.

26:55.174 --> 26:59.377
In the bullpen?

26:59.445 --> 27:00.879
Apparently,
the associates

27:00.947 --> 27:03.148
don't believe that I work
as hard as they do.

27:03.215 --> 27:04.816
What?

27:04.884 --> 27:06.885
Louis,
anyone who doesn't think

27:06.953 --> 27:09.621
you're the hardest-working
lawyer at this firm is an idiot.

27:09.689 --> 27:11.856
You may be a dick,
but as far as I'm concerned,

27:11.924 --> 27:13.491
the associates have it
pretty good.

27:13.559 --> 27:16.027
Thank you, Harvey.

27:16.095 --> 27:20.932
Dick part aside.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.601
Remember when
we were in here?

27:22.668 --> 27:24.636
What we had to do?
Like it was yesterday.

27:24.704 --> 27:26.438
I can still hear Hardman
reaming me out

27:26.505 --> 27:28.006
for losing
that Dunridge file.

27:28.074 --> 27:30.241
- You were sitting right here.
- I was so scared.

27:30.309 --> 27:33.912
I thought I'd be fired
right on the spot.

27:35.381 --> 27:37.582
- I hid it.
- I knew it! I knew it!

27:37.650 --> 27:40.251
I had to work 48 hours straight
just to recreate it.

27:40.319 --> 27:42.654
Yeah, but we killed it
at trial.

27:42.722 --> 27:43.888
Yeah,
if that happened now,

27:43.956 --> 27:45.290
I wouldn't hear the end of it.
I know.

27:45.358 --> 27:46.725
God forbid they have to pull
one all-nighter,

27:46.792 --> 27:48.026
let alone two.

27:48.094 --> 27:49.461
It's like
they think there's this law

27:49.528 --> 27:50.662
against working more than
20 hours a day.

27:50.730 --> 27:52.964
Well, there isn't.
Prima Donnas.

27:53.032 --> 27:56.801
I should fire them all right now
and start from scratch.

27:56.869 --> 27:58.336
Louis,

27:58.404 --> 28:01.940
I'm only going to say this once,
so you better enjoy it.

28:02.008 --> 28:04.943
You're the man.

[Dictaphone rewinding]

28:26.065 --> 28:27.565
[Dictaphone beeps]
You're the man.

28:27.633 --> 28:29.801
[Dictaphone rewinding]

28:32.271 --> 28:33.371
Harvey,
did you say somebody's the man?

28:33.439 --> 28:35.173
[Dictaphone beeps]
You're the man.

28:35.241 --> 28:37.242
Thanks.
Appreciate it.

28:37.309 --> 28:39.110
[Dictaphone rewinding]
Who's the man?

28:39.178 --> 28:40.311
[Dictaphone beeps]
You're the man.

28:40.379 --> 28:41.613
You know it.

28:41.681 --> 28:43.014
[Dictaphone rewinding]
What did you say?

28:43.082 --> 28:44.315
[Dictaphone beeps]
You're the man.

28:44.383 --> 28:47.318
Damn straight.

29:00.900 --> 29:03.101
What are you doing?

29:03.169 --> 29:04.669
Oh, uh, God.

29:04.737 --> 29:06.871
I'm sorry.
This--this looks awful.

29:06.939 --> 29:09.474
[Laughs awkwardly]
I'm working with Hardman.

29:09.542 --> 29:10.575
He needed a file,
and I--

29:10.643 --> 29:13.178
Why didn't
you just send Donna?

29:13.245 --> 29:15.680
Okay.
I deserve that.

29:17.183 --> 29:19.617
Rachel, I swear,
I didn't mean to--

29:19.685 --> 29:20.685
Oh, don't look at me
like that.

29:20.753 --> 29:23.688
It's not porn.
It's match.com.

29:23.756 --> 29:25.824
- So you're, uh--
- Yeah.

29:25.891 --> 29:27.125
I am.
That's good.

29:27.193 --> 29:30.462
- It is.
- I think it's, uh, good.

29:30.529 --> 29:31.663
Yeah, me too.

29:31.731 --> 29:34.199
Except that
I have been working

29:34.266 --> 29:36.468
on this essay
for the past three days,

29:36.535 --> 29:39.304
and this is
all I've got.

29:39.371 --> 29:42.907
- It's blank.
- I know.

29:42.975 --> 29:46.010
- Okay, how about you start
with something like this:

29:46.078 --> 29:49.080
"I work at the top firm
in Manhattan."

29:49.148 --> 29:50.315
Yeah.

29:50.382 --> 29:51.850
See, that's not really--
"I have an office,

29:51.917 --> 29:53.718
"which is unheard of
for a paralegal.

29:53.786 --> 29:55.153
That shows how much
they value me."

29:55.221 --> 29:56.221
Just hold on.

29:56.288 --> 30:00.058
[Tapping keys]

30:00.126 --> 30:01.659

30:03.729 --> 30:05.063
"I'm passionate.

30:05.131 --> 30:07.999
"Funny, tenacious.

30:08.067 --> 30:10.668

Any more adjectives?

30:10.736 --> 30:13.738
"Supercalifragilistic-
expialidocious.

30:13.806 --> 30:17.342
I'm incredibly smart,
sometimes aggressively so."

30:17.409 --> 30:19.711
You realize this is supposed
to make me sound good, right?

30:19.779 --> 30:22.514
Why don't you let me finish?

30:22.581 --> 30:25.250
"I'm a--

30:25.317 --> 30:27.418
"I'm also a kind person.

that I'm a foodie,

are obviously loaded,

but I'm still determined
to make it on my own."

I'm not going
to type that last part.

30:58.651 --> 31:00.185
Hey, it doesn't matter.

31:00.252 --> 31:04.122
You're still going to be beating
them away with a stick.

31:04.190 --> 31:07.358
Well, yeah, because you write
such a--such a good essay.

31:07.426 --> 31:13.198
No, I mean, after you post
a picture here.

31:44.423 --> 31:46.625
Every single one
of your assignments

31:46.692 --> 31:48.360
was completed by me
last night.

31:48.427 --> 31:49.861
What else
do we have left to do?

31:49.929 --> 31:51.563
- Uh, file it?
- Filing.

31:51.631 --> 31:54.533
Doc review, spell check.
Grunt work?

31:54.600 --> 31:57.469
Yes, grunt work.
Because that's your job.

31:57.537 --> 31:59.371
Let it be known that
I can do your work faster

31:59.438 --> 32:01.773
and better than any one of you
without shedding a tear

32:01.841 --> 32:03.341
or breaking a sweat,

32:03.409 --> 32:05.377
but I don't because

32:05.444 --> 32:07.245
writing briefs
and recommending arguments

32:07.313 --> 32:09.414
is how you learn.

32:09.482 --> 32:11.149
You go out to any other firm
right now

32:11.217 --> 32:13.585
at this stage of your career,
you won't have this opportunity.

32:13.653 --> 32:15.587
If you don't believe me,
I will write you

32:15.655 --> 32:18.023
the best recommendation
you have ever seen,

32:18.090 --> 32:20.859
and you can find out
for yourself.

32:20.927 --> 32:22.060
Go ahead.

32:22.128 --> 32:25.330
Any takers?

32:25.398 --> 32:27.365
That's what I thought.

32:27.433 --> 32:30.368
Now I have
ten new cases here.

32:30.436 --> 32:33.572
Who wants in?

32:33.639 --> 32:37.008
What are you guys waiting for?
Come and get them.

32:48.487 --> 32:49.888
Excellent work last night,
Mike.

32:49.956 --> 32:52.524
Thanks.

32:52.592 --> 32:54.459
Whoa, you didn't tell me
you were bringing her in.

32:54.527 --> 32:55.961
Who do you think
the proposal was for?

32:56.028 --> 32:57.228
Does Harvey even know about
this meeting?

32:57.296 --> 33:00.665
As a matter of fact, I do.

33:06.839 --> 33:09.074
- What's this?
- It's a pink slip.

33:09.141 --> 33:11.309
50 pink slips, in fact.

33:11.377 --> 33:13.612
For 50 nurses.
Excuse me?

33:13.679 --> 33:15.680
It's come to my attention
these nurses have been working

33:15.748 --> 33:17.382
past their 15-hour shift.

33:17.450 --> 33:19.217
And they don't put it
on their time card,

33:19.285 --> 33:20.552
but they still
sign charts,

33:20.620 --> 33:21.786
which happens
to release them

33:21.854 --> 33:24.489
from the protection
of federal labor law.

33:24.557 --> 33:26.658
You're bluffing.

33:26.726 --> 33:28.660
I found these 50
in one night.

33:28.728 --> 33:32.430
How many do you think
I'll find in a week?

33:35.968 --> 33:37.802
There's a way
out of this.

33:37.870 --> 33:40.105
Sign the contract.

33:41.507 --> 33:45.310
Your grandmother
would be proud.

33:45.378 --> 33:48.680
You have until the end
of the day.

33:52.485 --> 33:53.852
- Harvey!
- Let me guess.

33:53.919 --> 33:55.186
You're upset.

33:55.254 --> 33:56.788
I got you that information
through my grandmother.

33:56.856 --> 33:58.289
Your idea, not mine.

33:58.357 --> 34:00.258
Look, I know you might have
been hatched in a pod,

34:00.326 --> 34:01.993
but family actually means
something to me.

34:02.061 --> 34:03.828
And I gave you that information
to help the nurses,

34:03.896 --> 34:05.296
not strong-arm them.

34:05.364 --> 34:06.865
Were you okay with the first
deal we presented to Nell?

34:06.932 --> 34:09.000
- That is not the point.
- That's exactly the point.

34:09.068 --> 34:11.902
Because this is a contract that
our client can actually afford.

34:11.971 --> 34:13.338
- Harvey.
- Enough.

34:13.406 --> 34:15.206
You think I was joking when
I asked if you were ready

34:15.274 --> 34:16.241
to stick it to the nurses?

34:16.308 --> 34:17.876
I wasn't.

34:17.943 --> 34:19.878
I know you don't like
this part of the job,

34:19.945 --> 34:21.045
but it's part
of the job.

34:21.112 --> 34:23.581
If Prescott gives in
to their demands,

34:23.649 --> 34:25.583
they go out of business,
the nurses get nothing,

34:25.650 --> 34:26.784
it's a win-win.

34:26.851 --> 34:27.851
That's bullshit.

34:27.920 --> 34:31.089
It's a win
because you beat Daniel.

34:31.157 --> 34:32.524
I work with him,
I work with you,

34:32.591 --> 34:34.826
I work with him--
it doesn't take a genius

34:34.893 --> 34:36.194
to figure out that
you're playing each other,

34:36.262 --> 34:37.829
and you're using me
to do it.

34:37.897 --> 34:40.632
But you know what,
I don't care what's going on

34:40.699 --> 34:42.199
between the two of you,
but I don't want to be caught

34:42.268 --> 34:43.702
in the middle of it
ever again.

34:56.681 --> 34:59.584
[Knocking on door]

35:02.855 --> 35:05.924
Grammy, if that's you,
I swear to God,

35:05.991 --> 35:09.894
I'm going to have
the locks changed.

35:09.962 --> 35:11.162
Rachel.

35:11.230 --> 35:12.897
You hurt me.

35:12.965 --> 35:13.965
- I'm sorry.
- No.

35:14.033 --> 35:15.567
All those nice things
you said,

35:15.634 --> 35:18.670
those are the kinds of things
you say when you--

35:18.738 --> 35:19.838
look, if you feel
those things about me,

35:19.905 --> 35:21.806
why can't you
be with me?

35:23.876 --> 35:26.511
I told you,
you know, it's--it's work

35:26.579 --> 35:27.779
and--
and that guy.

35:27.847 --> 35:29.314
It's everything,
you know?

35:29.381 --> 35:30.582
I just--I don't think
it would work.

35:30.649 --> 35:32.817
I think it would be
a mistake.

35:32.885 --> 35:34.285
Yeah, you know what?
You did say that.

35:34.353 --> 35:35.920
And it's a lot of bullshit
because the Mike that I know

35:35.988 --> 35:38.556
and the Mike that I fell for--
he wouldn't do this.

35:38.624 --> 35:42.761
And if all of your feelings
are still there,

35:42.828 --> 35:44.162
then it only points
to one thing.

35:44.230 --> 35:47.132
And it's that you're keeping
something from me.

35:50.002 --> 35:52.303
I don't want
to lie to you.

35:52.371 --> 35:55.907
Then don't.

35:55.975 --> 35:58.710
Please, just--

35:58.778 --> 36:04.048
just tell me
what it is.

I thought so.

- Look, I want to tell you.

36:21.133 --> 36:22.801
- Then tell me.
- I can't.

36:22.868 --> 36:25.403
Why? I mean,
what could it possibly be?

36:25.471 --> 36:26.838
You're--
you're married?

36:26.906 --> 36:28.973
You're some kind of spy?
No, you don't understand.

36:29.041 --> 36:31.876
Look, once I tell you,
I can never take it back.

36:31.944 --> 36:36.614
This is my everything.

36:36.682 --> 36:38.817
I can't.

37:03.650 --> 37:05.504

37:05.507 --> 37:07.141
I wouldn't say fun.

the case or beating me?

of one.

a bargain.

No.

I'm not here to start a fight.
I'm here to apologize for one.

37:21.122 --> 37:24.225
The partner meeting--
you were welcoming me back.

37:24.292 --> 37:26.760
But I saw you sitting there
in my old chair,

37:26.828 --> 37:28.896
and I just--

37:28.964 --> 37:32.132
I'm sorry.

His words sound good.

37:36.805 --> 37:38.038
Only one problem.

You were starting stuff
before you even got here.

digging into cases,

a new office.

That was all part
of coming back.

37:47.582 --> 37:49.250
Not furnishing it
with my tea set.

37:49.317 --> 37:50.985
That's what this is about?

Don't you remember
where you got that tea set?

37:53.989 --> 37:56.724
Alicia gave it to you.

37:56.791 --> 37:59.093
And I took it
because I missed her.

37:59.160 --> 38:01.595
I'm sorry.

38:01.663 --> 38:03.831
I thought
you would understand that.

38:12.507 --> 38:14.575
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:14.643 --> 38:16.043
I need a copy
of the final agreement

38:16.111 --> 38:18.112
the nurses signed.
Yup, got it right here.

38:18.179 --> 38:21.015
Thank you.

38:21.082 --> 38:22.449
You look different.

38:24.853 --> 38:27.121
You have a date.

- Good night, Donna.
- Good night, Rachel.

Uh, truth be told,

38:35.931 --> 38:37.464
I was taking off
for the afternoon.

38:37.532 --> 38:39.333
Late night?

38:39.401 --> 38:41.235
- Nothing I can't handle.
- I believe it.

38:41.303 --> 38:42.803
I heard your speech
to the associates.

38:42.871 --> 38:45.639
And I just wanted to tell you
how impressed I was.

38:45.707 --> 38:47.308
Thank you.

38:47.375 --> 38:49.209
I always knew you were
the right man for the job,

38:49.277 --> 38:54.248
so it feels good to see it
in action.

38:54.316 --> 38:56.483
Something wrong?
No.

38:56.551 --> 38:58.719
Louis.

39:00.121 --> 39:03.324
If you really heard me
in there,

39:03.391 --> 39:05.359
you'd know that I give them
the chance to rise

39:05.427 --> 39:08.395
to the occasion.

39:08.463 --> 39:09.897
And I just wish every once
in a while,

39:09.965 --> 39:13.467
you might maybe
do the same for me.

39:22.877 --> 39:25.479
You wanted
to see me?

39:25.547 --> 39:27.514
Yeah, Mike.
Sit down.

39:37.993 --> 39:39.860
I wanted to tell you a story
that I should have told you

39:39.928 --> 39:41.362
the day Daniel
came back.

39:41.429 --> 39:44.098
When Jessica and I
found out

39:44.165 --> 39:46.166
that Daniel was embezzling
from clients,

39:46.234 --> 39:48.035
we confronted him.

39:48.103 --> 39:49.336
He broke down.

39:49.404 --> 39:50.738
He said
his wife had cancer,

39:50.805 --> 39:53.307
and he needed the money to try
and save her life.

39:53.375 --> 39:55.909
Turns out,
he needed the money

39:55.977 --> 39:59.880
to support his mistress.

39:59.948 --> 40:01.515
Now he's saying
he's different.

40:01.583 --> 40:02.816
But a man
who would do that

40:02.884 --> 40:05.753
is a man I find
very difficult to trust.

40:08.023 --> 40:09.390
Do you trust me?

40:09.457 --> 40:12.893
That's what
I wanted you to know.

40:22.771 --> 40:24.438
Is this
your first time?

40:24.506 --> 40:27.508
No.
I'm just...

40:27.575 --> 40:28.976
trying to forget
about the other times.

40:29.044 --> 40:30.310
Start fresh.

40:30.378 --> 40:32.012
Look, I mean to be rude.

40:32.080 --> 40:33.447
I just really want
to concentrate.

40:33.515 --> 40:35.215
You have three hours
to complete the exam.

40:35.283 --> 40:40.354
Good luck.
Your time starts now.

40:51.466 --> 40:55.069
[Knocking on door]

40:55.136 --> 40:57.137
Three times
in one week.

40:57.205 --> 40:59.440
I might have to write you back
into my will.

41:03.144 --> 41:05.079
What's wrong?

41:12.854 --> 41:14.888
[Clears throat]

41:17.926 --> 41:20.861
Plavix...

41:20.929 --> 41:23.297
stuck in my head,
so I looked it up.

41:23.364 --> 41:27.801
Something that you take
when you have a heart problem.

41:27.869 --> 41:30.104
Michael,
I'm 82 years old.

41:30.171 --> 41:32.139
I have
an everything problem.

41:32.207 --> 41:34.274
Why didn't you
tell me?

41:34.342 --> 41:36.276
That getting old sucks?

41:36.344 --> 41:38.112
You'll find out.

41:38.179 --> 41:40.013
And I don't tell you
every little thing

41:40.081 --> 41:41.315
because I don't want you
to worry.

41:41.382 --> 41:42.883
And if you
looked it up,

41:42.951 --> 41:46.320
you'd know that it's--
it's for preventive purposes.

41:46.387 --> 41:47.921
Did you read that part?

41:47.989 --> 41:49.556
Yeah, I kind of panicked

41:49.624 --> 41:51.325
when I got
to the heart problem part.

41:51.392 --> 41:54.394
I hope you do
a more thorough job at work.

41:54.462 --> 41:55.863
Okay, I make
the trip down here

41:55.930 --> 41:58.298
to express some serious concern,
and you mock me?

41:58.366 --> 42:01.101
[Chuckles]
With love.

42:01.169 --> 42:03.237
[Laughs]

42:03.304 --> 42:04.972
Okay.

42:05.039 --> 42:07.808
Enough of your stupid
health problems,

42:07.876 --> 42:09.810
let's get down to business,
deal with some of my real ones.

42:09.878 --> 42:10.878
You're young.

42:10.945 --> 42:12.513
You don't have
any real problems.

42:12.580 --> 42:14.782
Wrong.
I am making way too much money,

42:14.883 --> 42:16.383
and I don't have a girlfriend
to spend it on.

42:16.451 --> 42:19.353
I know
a few single ladies.

42:19.420 --> 42:21.221
Really?

42:21.289 --> 42:24.091
I can't go older than 70 though.
It's a ground rule.
