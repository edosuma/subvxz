Welcome back, sunshine.

11:49.970 --> 11:51.710

11:57.180 --> 11:59.810

11:59.820 --> 12:01.280
- It's not your fault.

12:01.280 --> 12:04.280
Abigail was still in control

Please don't do that.

You promised you wouldn't
blame yourself again.

Believe me, I am fine.

12:15.930 --> 12:19.000
Um, there are eggs in the fridge
if you're still hungry.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.130
I'm gonna take the car,
go check on another job.

12:21.140 --> 12:22.940
         - Since when do we have
          any food in the house?

12:22.940 --> 12:25.270
- Today's payday, right?

12:25.270 --> 12:28.980
I'll pick up a bottle of wine
or, you know, whatever for you,

12:28.980 --> 12:32.210
and we can divvy up the rest
when I get back.

12:32.210 --> 12:34.010
What the hell, Maria?

12:34.020 --> 12:35.920
      - You shouldn't have taken
           that bastard's money.

12:35.920 --> 12:37.250
- Why wouldn't I?

12:37.250 --> 12:38.890
             - Because we didn't
                 finish the job.

12:38.890 --> 12:40.990
            That demon got away,
   and it could still come back.

12:40.990 --> 12:43.460
   <i> You know that. Something was</i>
      <i> different about this one.</i>

12:43.460 --> 12:46.330
   They're getting stronger, and
she's getting harder to control.

12:46.330 --> 12:49.060
- Well, anyway,
you want your cut or no?

12:49.060 --> 12:51.900

          cutting you in, David.

12:51.900 --> 12:53.270
              That means we play
                    by my rules.

12:53.270 --> 12:56.440
- What am I--
your charity case?

12:56.440 --> 12:58.170
I look after you.

12:58.170 --> 13:01.340
What if Abigail had turned
on that kid's family?

13:01.340 --> 13:03.540
You want another situation
like what happened in Memphis?

13:03.550 --> 13:05.510
           - Stop it.
    - Look, okay, I'm sorry.

13:05.510 --> 13:07.850
I didn't--

13:07.850 --> 13:10.050
<i> Just don't forget how bad it</i>
<i> was before we came back here.</i>

13:10.050 --> 13:13.350
That demon bitch
is the parasite here, not me.

13:13.360 --> 13:16.320
                   - I told you,
         don't call her a bitch.

13:16.320 --> 13:19.890
- What, now you're
defending her?

13:19.900 --> 13:21.930
<i> Just remember</i>

<i> If Dad used it</i>
<i> to put Abigail inside of you,</i>

13:27.100 --> 13:29.140
<i> maybe we can use it</i>
<i> to get her out.</i>

13:29.140 --> 13:32.270
           - I'm just exhausted.

13:34.180 --> 13:35.940
- I know.

13:35.940 --> 13:38.240
I'm trying
to take care of you.

13:38.250 --> 13:40.450
Doing the best I can.

13:49.860 --> 13:54.460
- It's like I can still feel Dad
    in the city sometimes...

13:56.930 --> 13:59.530
      Like I can smell him
     in the damn tap water.

13:59.530 --> 14:03.600
- Let's just not make things any
harder than they already are.

14:03.610 --> 14:06.240
Okay?

14:06.240 --> 14:08.540

14:12.510 --> 14:16.280

out of this trailer park.

14:22.890 --> 14:24.460

We'll give you

15:45.270 --> 15:48.270

33:32.340 --> 33:33.340
                       - Gracie.

33:33.340 --> 33:36.210
            - Maria.

33:48.190 --> 33:50.620
<i> - Abigail was right all along.</i>

33:50.620 --> 33:53.060
 <i> Maybe that's what hurts most.</i>

33:53.060 --> 33:55.230
  <i> All these years searching,</i>

33:55.230 --> 33:59.700

   <i> was gonna fix everything.</i>

33:59.700 --> 34:03.670

   - Did you fix my door, Dusty?

34:25.659 --> 34:29.190

34:30.730 --> 34:34.230
          - You coming on to me?

34:34.230 --> 34:37.840
- Yeah.
I guess I am.

34:37.840 --> 34:40.170
And I make a mean fish stew.

34:40.170 --> 34:42.210
You want some?

34:45.280 --> 34:48.110
- I'd like to, but I don't think
             that's a good idea.

34:48.120 --> 34:54.420
       <i> - ¶ Time slows ¶</i>

34:56.790 --> 34:58.790
                - Thanks, Dusty.

35:02.530 --> 35:03.700
         - Good night.

Where are you going?

35:22.320 --> 35:24.750
             - You got your fix,
               and I got a date.

35:24.750 --> 35:26.620
                      [chuckles]

35:26.620 --> 35:28.750

35:28.760 --> 35:31.590
          - Hey, you'll be fine.

35:31.590 --> 35:33.630
              I'll be back soon.

35:33.630 --> 35:35.330
                           Okay?

36:12.830 --> 36:14.900
       - Don't torture yourself.

36:14.900 --> 36:17.270
The past is the past.

36:17.270 --> 36:21.710
You learn how to accept it
after a few thousand years.

36:21.710 --> 36:24.180
                  - I loved him.

36:24.180 --> 36:26.180
- I know you did.

36:28.280 --> 36:29.680
           - You broke my heart,

36:29.680 --> 36:33.550
      and I'll never forgive you
                       for that.

36:37.560 --> 36:39.290
                  Abigail, wait.

36:42.260 --> 36:47.370
        Did Grace--did her demon
            say anything to you?

36:47.370 --> 36:49.370
         Something about my mom?

36:50.540 --> 36:53.470
- Not a thing.

36:56.280 --> 36:57.610
- You left
before I could thank you.

36:57.610 --> 36:59.410
                       - [gasps]
                   Jesus Christ.

36:59.410 --> 37:02.780
             Don't ever sneak up
  on a possessed girl like that.

37:05.350 --> 37:07.620
     [door creaks, closes]

37:07.620 --> 37:09.690
- Grace says hello, Maria.

37:11.690 --> 37:15.390
        - She was asking
         about her mom.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.560
          Who was she?

37:17.560 --> 37:20.400
- I'm ashamed to say.

37:20.400 --> 37:23.000
Grace's mother
was a one-night stand.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.600
- Oh.

37:24.610 --> 37:26.670
So the Devil made you do it.

37:26.670 --> 37:28.710
You hypocrites
are all the same.

37:31.650 --> 37:33.780
    - I haven't always been
         a man of God.

37:33.780 --> 37:36.480
       - Save it for confession.

37:36.480 --> 37:39.020
       Why'd you come back here?
        You got what you wanted.

37:39.020 --> 37:40.720
- And now I want to help you.

37:40.720 --> 37:42.390
                      - [scoffs]

37:42.390 --> 37:44.260
                   <i> Thanks, Rev.</i>
         <i> I've tried holy water.</i>

37:44.260 --> 37:45.520
         It doesn't work either.

37:45.530 --> 37:48.360
- But stopping Enos will.

37:48.360 --> 37:49.860
            - If there is a God,

37:49.860 --> 37:53.300
       then He damned Enos' soul
               straight to hell.

37:53.300 --> 37:55.830
- Yes.

37:55.840 --> 37:58.500
But that was
God's big mistake,

37:58.510 --> 38:00.910
because sending a soul
like Enos to hell

38:00.910 --> 38:03.010
is like sending
a thief to prison.

38:03.010 --> 38:07.450
He just came back smarter and
a thousand times more powerful.

38:07.450 --> 38:09.350
I know you can feel it.

38:09.350 --> 38:11.880
I know you can see it.

38:11.890 --> 38:13.320
I mean, open your eyes

38:13.320 --> 38:15.690
and see the darkness
taking over this city.

38:21.300 --> 38:22.960
Why do you think
Jeremy was possessed?

38:22.960 --> 38:24.760
                 - I don't know.
                   I don't care.

38:28.700 --> 38:31.040
<i> - Jeremy's stepfather</i>
<i> is the judge</i>

38:31.040 --> 38:32.540
who signed the warrant

38:32.540 --> 38:34.010
for the Feds
to raid the compound.

38:34.010 --> 38:36.680
Enos is going after everyone
who ever crossed him.

38:43.950 --> 38:45.750
Enos is back,

38:45.750 --> 38:50.690
and that, Maria,
is an absolute fact.

38:50.690 --> 38:53.890
<i> And he's brought an army</i>
<i> of demons up with him</i>

38:53.890 --> 38:56.660
<i> that could be inside anybody,</i>

38:56.660 --> 39:00.670
<i> and so can Enos,</i>
<i> wearing any face he chooses.</i>

39:00.670 --> 39:01.830

<i> where he is.</i>

   - I'm not going anywhere.
       - What about Enos?

40:35.560 --> 40:36.900
- When that son of a bitch
shows his face,

40:36.900 --> 40:38.460
I'll make him wish
he stayed in hell.

40:38.470 --> 40:40.700
- With all that anger,
you're making me swoon.

40:40.700 --> 40:42.870
           - [gasps]
   - I'm not afraid of Enos.

40:42.870 --> 40:44.100

you would be.

40:47.610 --> 40:48.910

  - And I'll go back to hell.

40:50.480 --> 40:51.680
            You know
    what will happen to me.

40:51.680 --> 40:53.110

 <i> - This host of yours, Maria,</i>

40:55.620 --> 40:57.850

she doesn't give you

  the Order of Everlasting went.
