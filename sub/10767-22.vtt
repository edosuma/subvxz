00:01.700 --> 00:04.054
- Hey, Uncle Phil. What's up, man?
- Hey.

00:04.220 --> 00:05.335
Hey, what you looking at?

00:05.500 --> 00:08.856
Just some pictures of me and
Janice Robertson from back in the day.

00:09.020 --> 00:11.932
Here we are on campus
running from the National Guard.

00:12.100 --> 00:15.376
Man, she is fine!

00:15.980 --> 00:17.174
Tell me about it.

00:19.420 --> 00:21.331
And you're sure
that Aunt Viv is cool...

00:21.500 --> 00:24.014
...with your ex-girlfriend
coming to visit, huh?

00:24.180 --> 00:28.412
Oh well, actually, Janice
was never officially my girlfriend.

00:28.580 --> 00:30.252
Not that I didn't try.

00:30.420 --> 00:32.250
Man, oh, man, did I try.

00:32.420 --> 00:34.138
Flowers, poems, dinners.

00:34.300 --> 00:36.768
I must have sprung
for over 50 of them.

00:36.980 --> 00:39.699
Well, maybe it would have worked
if you had taken her too.

00:41.500 --> 00:43.695
Sorry, it was just
a little collegiate humor.

00:43.860 --> 00:44.929
Oh, God.

00:45.100 --> 00:48.456
You know what it's like to really
go after a woman and never get her?

00:48.620 --> 00:50.053
No.

00:52.460 --> 00:54.018
Finally, after two years...

00:54.180 --> 00:58.059
...I realized that Janice wasn't gonna
have me, so I settled for Vivian.

00:58.900 --> 01:00.697
With Vivian. With Vivian!

01:00.860 --> 01:02.339
Sweetheart, that came out wrong.

01:02.500 --> 01:05.936
Honey! Honey? Baby.

01:06.100 --> 01:09.137
Geoffrey, prepare Mr. Banks' couch.

01:11.000 --> 01:17.074

02:18.180 --> 02:20.569
So, what time is Dad's old flame
supposed to be here?

02:20.780 --> 02:22.577
Carlton, she's not Daddy's old flame.

02:22.740 --> 02:24.970
They weren't even intimate.

02:25.500 --> 02:27.172
Uncle Phil discussed that with you?

02:27.780 --> 02:31.329
No, I heard him say it in the hall
after Mom slammed the door in his face.

02:31.500 --> 02:33.775
Geoffrey, where's my purple tie?

02:33.940 --> 02:36.534
It's in your tie drawer
next to the Pringles.

02:39.100 --> 02:42.376
Least that's better than the Kit Kat
he keep with his drawers.

02:45.620 --> 02:47.975
I have the greatest news.
You know Al Riggins...

02:48.140 --> 02:50.017
...the talk-show host?
- Yeah.

02:50.180 --> 02:53.775
Well, he's in a coma and they want me
to test as his replacement.

02:54.740 --> 02:57.971
My horoscope was right.
This is my lucky day.

02:59.420 --> 03:02.173
Hilary, aren't you even
a little concerned?

03:02.340 --> 03:03.568
Oh, I'm plenty concerned.

03:03.740 --> 03:06.208
My competition
is anchorwoman Mara Lopez.

03:06.380 --> 03:09.850
And you know how they favor
those minority people.

03:12.820 --> 03:15.618
Maybe science can just come
get her brain now.

03:16.180 --> 03:17.977
Ashley, I need your help
in the kitchen.

03:18.140 --> 03:20.449
Geoffrey, will you set
an extra place at the table.

03:20.620 --> 03:23.214
Mr. Banks' friend is bringing
her daughter.

03:24.060 --> 03:26.528
Aunt Viv, I'm just curious.

03:26.700 --> 03:28.691
Would this daughter
be more of a playmate...

03:28.860 --> 03:33.297
...for baby Nicky, Ashley,
or none of the above?

03:33.460 --> 03:36.338
- She's 18.
- Good answer.

03:38.420 --> 03:39.535
Men.

03:42.380 --> 03:44.371
Hey, G, I gotta tell you, man.

03:44.540 --> 03:46.770
If this girl is built anything
like her mother...

03:46.940 --> 03:49.852
...I might have to check the premises,
you know what I'm saying?

03:50.020 --> 03:53.535
I might have to go see what the
foundation is like, know what I mean?

03:53.700 --> 03:56.168
Hold your permit, mister.
What makes you think...

03:56.340 --> 03:59.537
...the daughter's gonna opt for you
when she can have me?

04:00.260 --> 04:04.173
Well, number one, because
I don't be saying stuff like "opt."

04:06.220 --> 04:09.610
Number two, because Geoffrey
still has to cut up your food.

04:11.060 --> 04:14.769
Well, this hundred dollars says...

04:14.940 --> 04:18.250
...that she goes out with me first.

04:20.180 --> 04:23.138
Okay, here's 50.

04:23.300 --> 04:24.494
And another 50.

04:24.660 --> 04:28.414
You're on
and may the best man win: Me.

04:28.580 --> 04:31.413
Might I get in on this?

04:38.500 --> 04:43.779
Sure things don't come along
every day. On Master William.

04:44.100 --> 04:45.658
Why would you pick him?

04:45.860 --> 04:47.691
With all due respect, young sir...

04:47.860 --> 04:53.059
...I've seen you in action with women,
and quite frankly, you're an idiot.

04:53.860 --> 04:56.932
Fine, I got you both covered.

04:57.380 --> 05:00.133
So how do I look?

05:00.860 --> 05:03.454
Like a man asking for trouble.

05:03.620 --> 05:05.212
Oh, nonsense.

05:05.380 --> 05:07.655
Vivian and I had a long talk
about this yesterday.

05:07.820 --> 05:10.493
She is perfectly secure
with Janice's coming to visit.

05:11.340 --> 05:13.012
So, what happened to your nose, bro?

05:13.940 --> 05:15.259
Oh, this?

05:16.380 --> 05:19.213
- This?
- Well, l... I cut myself shaving.

05:19.380 --> 05:22.338
Oh, you were shaving
your nose? Okay.

05:22.660 --> 05:26.699
Was that before or after you poured
that bucket of cologne on your head?

05:27.140 --> 05:29.529
You are reading
way too much into this, Will.

05:29.700 --> 05:32.533
This is just a little dinner
with an old friend.

05:32.740 --> 05:34.219
Oh, that's her.

05:37.020 --> 05:40.569
Mrs. Robertson
and her daughter, Wendy.

05:42.380 --> 05:44.211
- Damn!
- Damn!

05:47.580 --> 05:51.050
When my editor decided to do a story
on post-earthquake syndrome...

05:51.220 --> 05:52.892
...I jumped at the chance.

05:53.060 --> 05:56.894
I haven't seen Philip
since the Princeton 10-year reunion.

05:57.060 --> 05:59.733
Remember, we took over
the registrar's office in '69?

05:59.900 --> 06:02.972
Do I? My eyes are still burning
from the tear gas.

06:03.740 --> 06:07.858
Wendy, your mother looked radiant
even in a gas mask.

06:08.020 --> 06:10.250
Oh, Phil, please stop.

06:10.420 --> 06:13.730
Yes, Phil, please stop.

06:19.340 --> 06:21.171
Thank you, Geoffrey.

06:24.220 --> 06:27.257
So I'm at an anti-war rally
getting ready to burn my draft card...

06:27.420 --> 06:29.331
...and Janice offers me a light.

06:29.540 --> 06:31.098
I am so against war.

06:31.260 --> 06:33.490
I mean, there's death
and destruction...

06:33.660 --> 06:35.855
...and they preempt
your favorite programs.

06:36.020 --> 06:39.137
<i>I remember during Desert Storm,
trying to find Knots Landing...</i>

06:39.300 --> 06:40.574
Are those prunes?

06:40.740 --> 06:44.369
Yes. I have this theory
about regularity.

06:44.540 --> 06:45.973
Perhaps after dinner...

06:46.140 --> 06:49.337
...we can go for a drive
and talk about it in depth.

06:50.980 --> 06:54.336
I'm telling you, G,
get down for another hundred.

06:54.940 --> 06:57.773
I was thinking maybe we could
take a walk on the beach...

06:57.940 --> 06:59.851
...find a little club, get our boogie on.

07:00.020 --> 07:01.339
Oh, I love to dance.

07:01.540 --> 07:04.976
Hey, I can dance better
than Will any day.

07:07.540 --> 07:09.292
Don't keep her out too late, Will.

07:09.900 --> 07:11.856
She's in good hands,
Mrs. Robertson.

07:12.020 --> 07:13.772
I know she is.

07:16.540 --> 07:19.771
I said I'll pay you when I get out!

07:27.980 --> 07:31.495
I had a great time, Will.
Where'd you learn to dance like that?

07:31.660 --> 07:33.616
Oh, the Arthur Murray Dance Studios.

07:33.780 --> 07:36.294
- Tango?
- Okay.

07:43.860 --> 07:45.578
So, what's up for tomorrow?

07:45.740 --> 07:47.332
I'm seeing you again, I hope.

07:48.580 --> 07:51.538
Who am I to crush
a young woman's dreams?

08:03.340 --> 08:04.614
Too bad your mom's in there.

08:04.820 --> 08:07.254
Oh, we have separate rooms.

08:07.420 --> 08:10.139
Well, then, where were we?

08:13.500 --> 08:19.257
Will, I like you, but this is going
a little too fast for me.

08:19.420 --> 08:20.648
For real?

08:20.820 --> 08:23.618
Here I thought I was taking it slow,
you know?

08:23.780 --> 08:27.011
No, no. That... That is
absolutely, absolutely perfect.

08:27.180 --> 08:29.057
- That's fine, that's fine.
- Okay.

08:29.740 --> 08:31.139
Well, it was fun.

08:31.300 --> 08:34.929
You have a good night,
and I'll see you tomorrow.

08:36.820 --> 08:39.015
- Night, Will.
- Good night.

08:39.419 --> 08:40.977
Good night, baby.

08:52.060 --> 08:53.812
Hey, Mrs. Robertson,
how you doing?

08:54.020 --> 08:55.931
- Will.
- I just dropped Wendy off.

08:56.100 --> 08:58.534
Listen, she was begging me
to come in. I told her no.

08:58.700 --> 09:00.292
I didn't think it was proper.

09:00.460 --> 09:03.133
I am sure
you're the perfect gentleman.

09:03.300 --> 09:06.053
- Yes, ma'am. Hey, good night.
- Will.

09:07.220 --> 09:10.257
Would you mind sharing
your earthquake recollections with me?

09:10.420 --> 09:11.978
What, now?

09:12.180 --> 09:14.933
Yes, I thought I might as well
get started tonight.

09:25.660 --> 09:27.730
Sit down. Make yourself comfortable.

09:27.900 --> 09:30.368
I'm just gonna go and freshen up.

09:33.060 --> 09:36.416
Hey, this is... This is a nice room
you got here.

09:36.780 --> 09:38.816
As far as rooms go.

09:46.180 --> 09:48.853
So how would you describe
the earthquake?

09:49.020 --> 09:52.410
Well, you know, it was kind of like
Shaq picked up the pool house...

09:52.580 --> 09:56.937
...and he was shaking it, you know,
like them little snow globes.

09:57.100 --> 09:59.455
You know, then...
Then I heard all this crying.

09:59.620 --> 10:01.178
Was that baby Nicky?

10:01.340 --> 10:03.535
No, no, baby Carlton.

10:05.540 --> 10:08.134
He's not the most mature
young man, is he?

10:08.780 --> 10:12.978
Well, he's kind of like a 10-year-old
trapped in a 12-year-old's body.

10:17.380 --> 10:19.769
Well, good night.

10:19.980 --> 10:22.335
But we've barely
scratched the surface.

10:24.900 --> 10:26.572
Listen...

10:27.460 --> 10:31.214
...Mrs. Robertson, I have to be
honest. I'm... I'm, you know...

10:31.380 --> 10:34.816
...not really feeling right about
being here with you in, you know...

10:34.980 --> 10:36.493
...that... That thing.

10:37.220 --> 10:38.369
Is there a problem?

10:38.900 --> 10:40.219
Well, yeah, I mean...

10:40.380 --> 10:43.053
...when a woman changes
into something more comfortable...

10:43.220 --> 10:47.054
...it usually means she wanna
get more comfortable, you know.

10:47.220 --> 10:51.850
And frankly, I'm a little uncomfortable
with this higher level of comfort.

10:52.380 --> 10:56.089
Will, I've put on a couple of pounds,
and my dress was too tight.

10:56.260 --> 10:57.659
There, you happy?

11:00.940 --> 11:02.692
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

11:02.860 --> 11:04.179
I was completely out of line.

11:04.380 --> 11:07.611
Listen, my uncle has a fat problem.
I should be more sensitive.

11:09.940 --> 11:11.498
You are so cute.

11:13.340 --> 11:17.015
Would you like to see some pictures
of Wendy in Saint-Tropez?

11:17.420 --> 11:21.777
What? Oh, yeah, pictures.
Yeah, pic... Yeah, sure.

11:23.420 --> 11:24.739
All right, easy.

11:43.660 --> 11:46.015
This is... This is nice.

11:46.180 --> 11:50.014
This is...
Oh, this is... This is nice.

11:50.180 --> 11:53.695
Look how...
Look how blue this water is.

11:58.260 --> 11:59.249
What's wrong?

11:59.420 --> 12:02.856
There's a picture right there of you
with no bathing suit top on!

12:03.020 --> 12:05.534
It's Saint-Tropez.
Lots of women go topless.

12:06.220 --> 12:07.335
Well, you know what?

12:07.500 --> 12:10.970
I'm gonna run down to the lobby, get
some of them free brochures, you know.

12:11.140 --> 12:13.529
Before... A free brochure.

12:13.700 --> 12:15.292
Will.

12:16.580 --> 12:19.140
You're not going anywhere.

12:20.540 --> 12:22.178
Okay.

12:38.980 --> 12:42.450
- Will?
- Oh, my God! Uncle Phil!

12:43.660 --> 12:46.732
- What are you doing sleeping out here?
- Vivian thought the couch...

12:46.900 --> 12:48.333
...was too good for me.

12:49.380 --> 12:50.369
You just getting in?

12:51.540 --> 12:53.576
Just because a guy comes in
in the morning...

12:53.740 --> 12:56.254
...wearing the same thing he had on
the night before...

12:56.420 --> 12:58.615
...that doesn't mean
he slept with anybody.

12:58.780 --> 13:01.055
Take it easy, I'm not
accusing you of anything.

13:01.220 --> 13:03.211
Maybe we parked
and watched the sun come up.

13:03.380 --> 13:05.416
- All right.
- Or maybe we sat in the lobby...

13:05.580 --> 13:08.652
...and we talked all night!
People do do that, you know!

13:08.820 --> 13:10.173
I said I believe you!

13:10.340 --> 13:11.329
Good!

13:12.460 --> 13:15.338
Because l...
I ain't do nothing wrong.

13:15.500 --> 13:18.060
Did you get to spend
any time with Wendy's mother?

13:18.540 --> 13:22.772
No, no, no. They was in two separate
rooms, and I wasn't in either one.

13:22.940 --> 13:25.010
Before she leaves,
try to spend time with her.

13:25.180 --> 13:26.818
She has a lot to offer.

13:28.420 --> 13:30.490
More than you know.

13:30.660 --> 13:32.969
- What?
- I said I gotta go.

13:33.540 --> 13:35.019
Well, well, well.

13:35.180 --> 13:38.331
And where have you been
all night, mister?

13:38.660 --> 13:42.448
I'm sorry, I only answer
to people over 5 feet.

13:50.820 --> 13:53.175
You're over 5 feet, aren't you?

13:57.860 --> 14:00.932
Oh, boy. That was a lot of fun.
I sure love those old movies.

14:01.100 --> 14:05.616
Oh, yeah.
Cleopatra Jones, the superbad sister.

14:05.780 --> 14:07.930
Who do you think would win
in a street fight?

14:08.100 --> 14:10.375
Cleopatra Jones or Grace Jones?

14:10.540 --> 14:13.816
Oh, see, now you're getting
philosophical on me now, see.

14:14.020 --> 14:17.456
See, now, Cleopatra Jones, see,
she got that karate stuff, right?

14:17.620 --> 14:20.578
She got some sweet moves on her.
Plus, she be packing heat.

14:20.740 --> 14:25.018
But Grace Jones, she just scary.

14:26.620 --> 14:30.010
- You've really been thinking about this.
- Yup.

14:30.860 --> 14:33.328
Something else
I've been thinking about too.

14:40.180 --> 14:42.330
Am I intruding on anything?

14:45.100 --> 14:49.298
Hey, Mrs. Robertson, hey.
What you doing here?

14:49.460 --> 14:52.532
Well, your uncle invited me over
for a little backyard barbecue.

14:52.740 --> 14:55.538
Yeah, well, yeah. We was about
to go get our eat on too.

14:55.740 --> 14:58.459
- Come on, Wendy, let's go.
- Oh, I love barbecue.

14:58.620 --> 15:00.815
Help yourself, honey.
There's plenty of food.

15:03.540 --> 15:05.451
Stop playing.

15:09.860 --> 15:11.418
Well...

15:12.220 --> 15:14.654
I think I'm gonna go get me
some ribs, you know...

15:14.820 --> 15:17.937
...because, you know, my Uncle Phil
likes to eat while he cooks...

15:18.100 --> 15:21.536
...and might not be nothing left for
nobody else, you know what I'm saying?

15:24.820 --> 15:28.608
Well, Will, I didn't expect
to see you again so soon.

15:28.780 --> 15:31.738
Listen, maybe I fell for you last night.

15:31.900 --> 15:34.573
But I ain't never falling for you again.

15:34.980 --> 15:38.370
Relax, Will, you think I want
my daughter to find out?

15:38.540 --> 15:40.656
How would it make me look?

15:43.260 --> 15:44.978
Crazy.

15:48.900 --> 15:51.130
Boy, Wendy deserves
a lot better than Will.

15:51.300 --> 15:52.892
When I think how we conned her...

15:53.060 --> 15:55.096
...into going out with him,
it makes me sick.

15:55.260 --> 15:57.410
At least I had some respect for her.

15:57.860 --> 16:00.613
Carlton, you bet 200 dollars on her.

16:00.780 --> 16:02.975
Hey, that's a very respectable bet.

16:04.220 --> 16:09.817
Well, the secret to a successful
cookout is flame control.

16:09.980 --> 16:11.971
Remember the last barbecue
we were at?

16:12.140 --> 16:14.700
We were on the Jersey Shore
protesting that toxic dump.

16:14.860 --> 16:17.135
Oh, is that why that chicken
tasted so funny?

16:17.620 --> 16:20.737
We formed a human chain and kept
the trucks out. Oh, remember?

16:20.900 --> 16:23.937
Of course I remember. You were
wearing that calico halter-top.

16:24.460 --> 16:27.133
You know, I still have that halter-top.

16:29.860 --> 16:32.169
Philip, the fire's getting
a little too hot.

16:35.820 --> 16:37.970
There, that's better.

16:38.620 --> 16:41.293
Vivian, that was extremely childish.

16:41.460 --> 16:42.529
Childish?

16:42.700 --> 16:46.010
You are the one who is gawking
over this woman in our own backyard.

16:46.180 --> 16:49.411
She is an old friend.
You cannot fault me for being friendly.

16:49.820 --> 16:52.414
Saint Bernards are friendly.

16:52.580 --> 16:55.048
But even they don't slobber
as much as you.

16:57.820 --> 17:02.416
Vivian, this is such a beautiful home.
You are a very lucky woman.

17:02.580 --> 17:04.935
Excuse me, I have to go check
on our baby.

17:08.020 --> 17:09.248
Something I said?

17:09.420 --> 17:12.332
No, Vivian is just a little
uncomfortable with our friendship...

17:12.500 --> 17:15.298
...even though I told her
nothing ever happened between us.

17:15.500 --> 17:18.696
You know, that was one
of my biggest regrets.

17:18.900 --> 17:20.378
Really?

17:20.540 --> 17:24.249
I guess back then I just didn't
appreciate the kind of man you are.

17:26.859 --> 17:29.135
I would like to take you out
to dinner tomorrow.

17:29.300 --> 17:31.530
You know, we go back
to New York the next day.

17:31.700 --> 17:36.933
Oh, well... Well, I appreciate that,
but Vivian's busy tomorrow night.

17:38.020 --> 17:41.296
Well then, how about
just the two of us?

17:41.460 --> 17:42.939
Oh, no, I don't think so.

17:43.100 --> 17:45.660
Well, it'll be more business,
you know, than pleasure.

17:45.820 --> 17:48.288
You know, I need more insight
on my article.

17:49.220 --> 17:54.294
- I guess there's no harm in that.
- Oh, good. Say 8:00 tomorrow?

17:54.460 --> 17:55.688
My hotel? Dinner?

17:55.860 --> 17:57.418
Sounds fine.

17:57.580 --> 17:59.969
Hey, Uncle Phil, hey.

18:00.140 --> 18:03.769
Listen, can l...? Can I talk to you
in the kitchen for a second?

18:03.940 --> 18:04.929
Will, I am cooking.

18:05.100 --> 18:07.694
Yeah, your goose.
Can I see you in the...

18:07.900 --> 18:10.414
Excuse us, Janice.

18:15.180 --> 18:18.490
Uncle Phil, you cannot go to the hotel
with that woman.

18:18.700 --> 18:20.133
It's just for a little dinner.

18:20.300 --> 18:23.690
Yeah, then dessert, the likes of which
even you ain't never seen.

18:23.900 --> 18:26.368
Can't you see...? Uncle Phil.

18:26.540 --> 18:30.089
Janice is the one that got away, right?

18:30.260 --> 18:31.693
Yeah.

18:32.580 --> 18:35.572
Well, she ain't get away from me.

18:36.100 --> 18:37.089
What?

18:38.300 --> 18:41.610
Uncle Phil, I was dropping Wendy off
back at the hotel, right?

18:41.780 --> 18:44.613
Then I'm walking down the hall,
and Mrs. Robertson comes up...

18:44.780 --> 18:47.533
...and she asking me about the quake,
so I'm telling her...

18:47.700 --> 18:50.134
...and then she slips into something
more comfortable.

18:50.300 --> 18:53.098
Then she grab these pictures,
she's showing pictures of San...

18:53.260 --> 18:57.412
San-something, and then,
you know, before I knew it, you know:

19:11.940 --> 19:13.578
You slept with Janice!

19:20.140 --> 19:21.937
Ashley, go to your room.

19:22.100 --> 19:23.613
Oh, I love this!

19:26.380 --> 19:27.972
And take Carlton with you.

19:28.140 --> 19:29.414
Hey, I'm not going anywhere.

19:29.580 --> 19:31.696
You heard what I said.

19:33.380 --> 19:35.689
Mother, is this true?

19:37.980 --> 19:39.811
No, I can't believe you did this.

19:39.980 --> 19:42.540
Oh, and you, Will, how could you?

19:42.700 --> 19:44.497
Listen, listen. Now...

19:44.700 --> 19:46.850
...I was... I was just...
I was... Earthquake...

19:47.020 --> 19:49.693
...and, you know, and then we...
And... And then...

19:49.860 --> 19:52.533
Have you ever seen
your mother naked?

19:53.580 --> 19:56.413
Will, you are just really a class act.

19:56.580 --> 19:58.775
- But...
- Excuse me.

19:59.260 --> 20:01.330
Oh, yeah, go blame it on me!

20:04.060 --> 20:06.335
Janice, I think you'd better leave.

20:06.500 --> 20:10.175
Vivian, this is not as big
as you're making it out to be.

20:10.340 --> 20:12.137
Maybe not in your little world.

20:21.260 --> 20:25.776
Too bad, Philip.
We could have had something special.

20:26.740 --> 20:28.378
I have something special.

20:42.460 --> 20:44.451
Bye, Mrs. Robertson.

20:45.660 --> 20:47.890
I have been such a fool.

20:48.820 --> 20:50.378
Can you forgive me?

20:50.540 --> 20:52.849
I always do, don't I?

20:57.500 --> 20:59.889
You don't have to sleep
on the chaise lounge tonight.

21:00.060 --> 21:01.288
I don't?

21:01.460 --> 21:03.894
You can sleep on your couch.

21:05.500 --> 21:09.334
And have a talk
with this young man, please.

21:14.620 --> 21:16.815
Hey, Uncle Phil, man, look.

21:16.980 --> 21:19.858
I'm 19 years old,
and I'm gonna make some mistakes.

21:20.060 --> 21:22.210
Yeah, I'm 45 and I make them too.

21:22.380 --> 21:24.940
The secret is to learn from them.

21:26.660 --> 21:28.571
Yeah, you right,
I learned my lesson.

21:28.740 --> 21:32.494
From now on, I'm only dating girls
with ugly moms.

21:34.820 --> 21:37.175
I'm gonna go lay on my couch.

21:44.740 --> 21:47.334
Four, three, two...

21:48.020 --> 21:50.454
Thank you. Thank you.

21:50.620 --> 21:51.848
Today on our show:

21:52.020 --> 21:54.488
Women who hate men,
and the men who hate them back.

21:54.660 --> 21:55.979
Cut it!

21:56.180 --> 21:57.499
Great news, Hil.

21:57.660 --> 21:59.855
Al has completely recovered
from his coma.

22:00.020 --> 22:01.658
I guess you're not
gonna be needed.

22:01.820 --> 22:03.048
Al, Al, Al!

22:03.220 --> 22:04.972
Doesn't anybody care
about my needs?

22:05.180 --> 22:07.296
Do you have any idea
how much this outfit cost?

22:07.460 --> 22:10.372
And the statute's not up yet
on that sexual harassment case.

22:10.540 --> 22:12.371
- You wouldn't dare.
- Don't think I won't.

22:12.540 --> 22:15.532
I'll drag you through the mud.
I went through so much to do this!

22:15.700 --> 22:18.772
- Think because you got a pretty face...
- I caught up on everything!

22:18.940 --> 22:21.135
...you can talk to me like this!
- I am perfect!

22:21.300 --> 22:23.814
I'm the producer!
I suppose you're gonna bring Al up...

22:23.980 --> 22:27.734
...on a sexual harassment suit too.
Well, you won't get away with it!
