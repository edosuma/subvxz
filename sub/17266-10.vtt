06:48.533 --> 06:50.166
- I'LL TELL YOU WHERE I'M NOT.

06:50.200 --> 06:51.233
AT HOME.

06:51.266 --> 06:53.734
BECAUSE TINA FLEW OFF
THE BIRD HANDLE,

06:53.767 --> 06:57.066
AND I HAD TO FLY THE COOP.

06:57.100 --> 06:59.033
CANDY, CAN I HAVE
ANOTHER ZIMA, PLEASE?

06:59.066 --> 07:00.467
I WILL TALK TO YOU LATER.

07:00.500 --> 07:03.633
WE WILL CONTINUE THIS DISCOURSE
AT A DIFFERENT TIME, EMMA.

07:03.667 --> 07:05.166
- OKAY, MARK?
MARK?

07:05.200 --> 07:06.633
[sighs]

07:06.667 --> 07:08.433
- DID YOU GET
THOSE VINTAGE CAKE STANDS?

07:08.467 --> 07:10.200
- NO.
MARK AND TINA HAD A FIGHT.

07:10.233 --> 07:12.433
HE IS DRUNK ON ZIMAS AT ROSIE'S,
SO I'M GONNA GO GET HIM.

07:12.467 --> 07:14.100
- OKAY, WELL,
LET ME GET DRESSED,

07:14.133 --> 07:15.633
AND I'LL JUST GET HER STUFF
TOGETHER AND THEN WE CAN GO.

07:15.667 --> 07:17.233
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
YOU'RE NOT COMING.

07:17.266 --> 07:18.367
- WELL, I'M NOT
STAYING AT HOME.

07:18.400 --> 07:20.000
OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,
I'M NOT LETTING YOU

07:20.033 --> 07:21.567
GO TO A BAR WHERE YOUR EX
IS BY HIMSELF DRUNK.

07:21.600 --> 07:22.734
THAT'S NOT APPROPRIATE.

07:22.767 --> 07:24.233
AND SHE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE HAPPY

07:24.266 --> 07:26.667
UNLESS SHE'S IN A CAR OR MOVING,
SO I'M COMING.

07:26.700 --> 07:28.300
[baby voice]
YOU WANT TO GO TO ROSIE'S?

07:28.333 --> 07:30.066
YOU WANT TO RIDE IN THE CAR
AND GO TO ROSIE'S?

07:30.100 --> 07:31.767
MAYBE SHE'LL GO TO SLEEP THEN.
- ALL RIGHT, FINE.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.567
BUT P.S., I'M STILL MAD AT YOU.

07:33.600 --> 07:35.500
- [baby voice]
I'M STILL MAD AT YOU.

07:35.533 --> 07:37.633
- [goofy voice]
AND I AM STILL MAD AT YOU.

07:39.033 --> 07:41.734
[people chatting]

07:41.767 --> 07:42.734
- SEE WHERE HE IS.

07:42.767 --> 07:43.767
OH, MY GOD.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.166
SORRY.

07:45.200 --> 07:47.033
WHAT HAPPENED TO ROSIE'S?

07:47.066 --> 07:48.333
I'VE NEVER SEEN SO MUCH
FRINGED LEATHER

07:48.367 --> 07:49.367
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

07:49.400 --> 07:50.433
- I FORGOT.
IT'S BIKER WEEK.

07:50.467 --> 07:51.700
YOU KNOW,
WHEN THOSE DAYTONA GUYS

07:51.734 --> 07:52.767
MAKE THEIR WAY UP THE COAST?

07:53.000 --> 07:54.166
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
WHY DON'T YOU

07:54.200 --> 07:56.033
TAKE THE BABY BACK TO THE CAR
AND WAIT FOR ME.

07:56.066 --> 07:57.433
- NO WAY.
SHE'S NEVER BEEN HAPPIER.

07:57.467 --> 08:00.233
MUST BE ALL THE CLASSIC ROCK
OR SOMETHING.

08:00.266 --> 08:01.400
- OKAY, WELL,
WHY DON'T WE JUST

08:01.433 --> 08:03.066
FIND MARK AND GET OUT OF HERE,
OKAY?

08:03.100 --> 08:04.200
EXCUSE ME, SIR, WE JUST NEED--

08:04.233 --> 08:06.467
- WHO THE HELL
ARE YOU CALLING SIR?

08:06.500 --> 08:07.467
- OH, NO.

08:07.500 --> 08:08.467
- SUZY, GET OVER HERE.

08:08.500 --> 08:10.500
THIS BITCH JUST CALLED ME SIR.

08:10.533 --> 08:12.500
- WE DON'T NEED TO GET SUZY
INVOLVED, I DON'T THINK--

08:12.533 --> 08:13.500
- [cooing]

08:13.533 --> 08:15.100
- OH, MY GOD, IS THAT A BABY?

08:15.133 --> 08:16.667
HI. HOW OLD?

08:16.700 --> 08:18.166
- OH, SHE'S SIX WEEKS.

08:18.200 --> 08:20.633
THIS IS ACTUALLY HER FIRST TIME
OUT OF THE HOUSE.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.133
- WHEN SHE STARTS TEETHING,

08:22.166 --> 08:24.567
TAKE AN OLD RAG,
SOAK IT IN WHISKEY,

08:24.600 --> 08:26.033
POP IT IN THE FREEZER.

08:26.066 --> 08:27.400
CALMS HER RIGHT DOWN.

08:27.433 --> 08:29.400
- OH, THAT IS A HELPFUL HINT.

08:29.433 --> 08:30.533
- OKAY, I'M SORRY.

08:30.567 --> 08:32.200
WE HAVE TO ACTUALLY FIND
OUR FRIEND, SO...

08:32.233 --> 08:34.233
- I BET YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR THAT TALL DRINK OF WATER--

08:34.266 --> 08:35.300
THE ONE NOT WEARING LEATHER.

08:35.333 --> 08:36.367
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

08:36.400 --> 08:37.567
HE'S OVER AT THE BAR
WITH TOBY.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.266
- WHAT KIND OF MOTORCYCLE
DO YOU HAVE, SIR?

08:39.300 --> 08:40.300
both: OH, THANK YOU.

08:40.333 --> 08:41.600
- BYE, LITTLE BABY.

08:41.633 --> 08:43.033
CAN I HOLD HER?

08:43.066 --> 08:45.033
- NO, SIR, THANK YOU--
I'M SORRY, MA'AM.

08:45.066 --> 08:46.567
- AND LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING ELSE, TOBY.

08:46.600 --> 08:47.633
PRISON SOUNDS GOOD.

08:47.667 --> 08:50.133
THE TOILET
IS RIGHT BESIDE YOUR BED.

08:50.166 --> 08:52.533
MY TOILET IS SO FAR AWAY--
- MARK?

08:52.567 --> 08:54.367
- [gasps]
EMMA!

08:54.400 --> 08:56.000
[chuckles]
AND MAGS!

08:56.033 --> 08:57.133
IS THAT THE--
BABY!

08:57.166 --> 08:58.133
- SHH.

08:58.166 --> 08:59.166
- OH, THE BABY'S SL--

08:59.200 --> 09:00.200
SHH, EVERYBODY.

09:00.233 --> 09:01.200
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:01.233 --> 09:02.500
WE'RE GONNA GET YOU HOME.

09:02.533 --> 09:04.433
SO I'M GONNA HELP YOU GET UP
OFF OF THE STOOL, OKAY?

09:04.467 --> 09:06.066
- OH, NO, NO, NO.
NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

09:06.100 --> 09:07.467
MM-MM.
NO, NOT WITHOUT THIS.

09:07.500 --> 09:08.734
- WAIT, WHY ARE YOU DOING

09:08.767 --> 09:10.200
THE SINGLE LADIES DANCE
WITH YOUR HAND?

09:10.233 --> 09:11.567
- NOT WITHOUT THIS, MM-MM.
- WHY IS--

09:11.600 --> 09:13.367
- MARK, WHY DON'T YOU HAVE
YOUR WEDDING RING?

09:13.400 --> 09:17.100
- 'CAUSE THAT GUY OVER THERE
IS BETTER AT ME THAN POOL.

09:17.133 --> 09:18.100
- [snorts]

09:18.133 --> 09:21.133
[laughter]

09:28.266 --> 09:29.233
IN A POOL GAME?

09:29.266 --> 09:30.767
- I DID?

09:31.000 --> 09:32.767
OH, NO.
YOU GUYS, LOOK.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.533
- OKAY. STOP DOING THAT.
THIS IS REALLY BAD.

09:34.567 --> 09:36.400
- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
- WH-WH--MAGGIE, MAGGIE.

09:36.433 --> 09:37.767
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

09:38.000 --> 09:39.233
I'M GONNA GO
GET HIS RING BACK.

09:39.266 --> 09:40.500
- OKAY, I DON'T THINK
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

09:40.533 --> 09:41.667
- I CAN TAKE CARE OF IT.
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:41.700 --> 09:43.367
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
LEAVE THE BABY WITH ME?

09:43.400 --> 09:44.400
- I CAN TAKE CARE OF IT.
GOD.

09:44.433 --> 09:46.300
- ORTEGA, LO SIENTO.

09:46.333 --> 09:48.400
THEY SAID THEY HAVE NO MORE
OF THOSE JALAPEÑO POPPERS.

09:48.433 --> 09:49.667
- WHAT DOES A MAN HAVE TO DO

09:49.700 --> 09:51.500
TO GET A HOT PEPPER
IN THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT?

09:51.533 --> 09:53.266
I'M SICK OF THESE GODDAMN CLAMS!

09:53.300 --> 09:55.266
- HI.

09:55.300 --> 09:59.500
MY NAME IS MAGGIE,
AND THIS IS CHARLOTTE.

09:59.533 --> 10:02.266
LISTEN, MY FRIEND OVER THERE,

10:02.300 --> 10:05.066
HE DOES NOT HOLD HIS LIQUOR
WELL.

10:05.100 --> 10:06.600
- THAT'S 'CAUSE HE ONLY DRINKS
ZIMAS.

10:06.633 --> 10:08.033
[laughter]

10:08.066 --> 10:10.667
- ANYWAY, UM...
[chuckles]

10:10.700 --> 10:13.100
MY FRIEND MISTAKENLY BET
HIS WEDDING RING,

10:13.133 --> 10:14.500
AND HE'S GONNA NEED IT BACK,

10:14.533 --> 10:17.266
SO IF YOU COULD MAYBE FIND
SOME KINDNESS IN YOUR HEART--

10:17.300 --> 10:21.233
- YOU KNOW, MADRE,
I HAVE KINDNESS IN MY HEART,

10:21.266 --> 10:23.000
BUT NOT WHEN IT COMES TO BETS.

10:23.033 --> 10:24.233
BECAUSE IF I SOFTEN,

10:24.266 --> 10:26.300
EVEN FOR A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
SUCH AS YOURSELF...

10:26.333 --> 10:27.433
[chuckles]

10:27.467 --> 10:30.033
I WOULD BE GUTTED
IN THE STREETS PUBLICLY.

10:30.066 --> 10:32.100
[laughter]

10:32.133 --> 10:33.734
- ORTEGA, I DON'T MEAN
TO GET NASTY WITH YOU,

10:33.767 --> 10:35.467
BUT I'M GONNA NEED
THAT RING BACK

10:35.500 --> 10:37.200
BEFORE I LEAVE THIS BAR.

10:37.233 --> 10:39.333
COMPRENDE USTED, SEÑOR?

10:39.367 --> 10:40.734
- HEY, LISTEN,
IT'S "COMPRENDES."

10:40.767 --> 10:42.266
- I'M SORRY,
I WAS USING THE FORMAL.

10:42.300 --> 10:43.533
OR WOULD YOU RATHER ME
REFER TO YOU

10:43.567 --> 10:44.700
AS A COMMON STREET THUG?

10:44.734 --> 10:46.467
all: OH!

10:46.500 --> 10:47.600
- I GOT AN "A" IN AP SPANISH,

10:47.633 --> 10:49.233
AND THERE'S MORE
WHERE THAT CAME FROM.

10:49.266 --> 10:50.433
all: OOH.

10:50.467 --> 10:52.433
- HEY, LISTEN,
I WOULD PLAY SEÑOR ZIMA AGAIN,

10:52.467 --> 10:55.700
BUT HE'S GOT NOTHING LEFT
TO BET.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.433
- 2014 TOYOTA HIGHLANDER.

11:01.467 --> 11:04.266
FIVE-SPOKE ALLOY WHEELS,
BLIND SPOT MONITOR,

11:04.300 --> 11:05.467
POWER LIFTGATE.

11:05.500 --> 11:06.633
- BACK-UP CAMERA?

11:06.667 --> 11:09.200
- STANDARD.

11:09.233 --> 11:10.767
- HEY, RICO!
- YEAH, ESE?

11:11.000 --> 11:12.300
- RACK 'EM UP.
- YOU GOT IT!

11:12.333 --> 11:13.500
- WE GOT A MADRE HERE

11:13.533 --> 11:15.333
WHO WANT TO PLAY
FOR HER FRIEND'S SILVER BAND.

11:15.367 --> 11:16.734
[laughter]

11:16.767 --> 11:18.233
- MARK, EVERYBODY HAS FIGHTS.

11:18.266 --> 11:19.233
- NOT LIKE THIS ONE.

11:19.266 --> 11:20.734
THIS WAS THE THRILLA IN MANILA.

11:20.767 --> 11:22.166
- WAS THIS ABOUT
THE CHINA STUFF?

11:22.200 --> 11:23.467
'CAUSE I SHOULD'VE
NEVER TOLD TINA

11:23.500 --> 11:25.133
THAT YOU SAID
YOU WOULD'VE GONE WITH ME.

11:25.166 --> 11:26.600
THAT WAS--
- IT'S NOT ABOUT CHINA, OKAY?

11:26.633 --> 11:27.600
I GOT A JOB.

11:27.633 --> 11:28.700
PERSON OFFERED ME A JOB.

11:28.734 --> 11:31.633
- OKAY, WHAT JOB
DID "PERSON" OFFER YOU?

11:31.667 --> 11:33.667
- STAMFORD POLICE.

11:33.700 --> 11:35.200
THEY OFFERED ME SERGEANT.

11:35.233 --> 11:37.000
IN A YEAR OR SO,
I COULD GET TO DETECTIVE.

11:37.033 --> 11:38.300
- MARK, THAT IS AMAZING.

11:38.333 --> 11:39.467
- YEAH.
- OH, MY GOD.

11:39.500 --> 11:41.200
YOU'VE WANTED THAT
EVER SINCE YOU WATCHED

11:41.233 --> 11:42.667
YOUR FIRST EPISODE
OF MURDER, SHE WROTE.

11:42.700 --> 11:43.767
- JUST TO BE CLEAR,

11:44.000 --> 11:45.500
THAT'S NOT THE REASON
I BECAME A COP.

11:45.533 --> 11:47.133
- OKAY,
BUT ON YOUR ANSWERING MACHINE,

11:47.166 --> 11:48.133
IT USED TO BE LIKE,

11:48.166 --> 11:49.533
[humming
Murder, She Wrote Theme]

11:49.567 --> 11:51.667
- I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING, MAN.

11:51.700 --> 11:53.600
ANGELA LANSBURY
WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY FOR ME.

11:53.633 --> 11:55.333
- IS TINA NOT HAPPY FOR YOU?

11:55.367 --> 11:57.266
- NO, BECAUSE STAMFORD
IS THREE HOURS AWAY,

11:57.300 --> 11:59.000
AND WE'D HAVE TO MOVE.

11:59.033 --> 12:00.467
- TINA DOESN'T WANT TO LEAVE
PINEBROOK.

12:00.500 --> 12:01.600
- NO.

12:01.633 --> 12:03.233
AND WHEN I BROUGHT IT UP,
SHE FLIPPED OUT,

12:03.266 --> 12:05.000
TOLD ME HOW SELFISH I WAS,

12:05.033 --> 12:07.133
AND THEN--
WASN'T EVEN HAPPY FOR ME.

12:07.166 --> 12:09.767
NOT FOR EVEN, LIKE,
ONE SECOND.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.166
WHAT ABOUT WHAT I WANT, TOBY?

12:12.200 --> 12:15.066
- WAIT,
DID YOU JUST CALL ME TOBY?

12:15.100 --> 12:16.066
- YEAH, TOBY.

12:16.100 --> 12:18.633
- NO, I'M EMMA.

12:18.667 --> 12:19.633
- WHO THE HELL IS THIS?

12:19.667 --> 12:22.100
- THAT'S TOBY.

12:22.133 --> 12:23.467
[sighs]

12:23.500 --> 12:24.633
- OH, YOU MIGHT WANT
TO SIT DOWN.

12:24.667 --> 12:25.767
IT'S GONNA BE A WHILE.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.667
- OH, THIS ISN'T
HER FIRST RODEO, RICO.

12:29.700 --> 12:31.367
- FIVE IN THE CORNER POCKET.

12:31.400 --> 12:33.000
[clears throat]

12:33.033 --> 12:34.266
- [fussing]

12:34.300 --> 12:35.266
- SORRY.

12:35.300 --> 12:36.266
[shushing]

12:36.300 --> 12:37.567
IT'S OKAY.

12:37.600 --> 12:38.567
OH.

12:38.600 --> 12:39.667
- YOU HAVING TROUBLE, MADRE?

12:39.700 --> 12:41.266
- NO, NO, NO.
I'M GOOD.

12:41.300 --> 12:44.266
FIVE IN THE SIDE POCKET.

12:44.300 --> 12:45.367
[clears throat]

12:49.300 --> 12:50.266
[sighs]

12:50.300 --> 12:51.266
DAMN IT.

12:51.300 --> 12:52.667
I DON'T USUALLY MISS THAT ONE.

12:52.700 --> 12:54.100
- IT'S THE BABY.
IT GOT IN THE WAY.

12:54.133 --> 12:55.367
- I DON'T THINK SO, MAN.

12:55.400 --> 12:56.667
- WHY DON'T YOU LET YOUR FRIEND
BLONDIE OVER HERE

12:56.700 --> 12:57.767
HOLD THE BABY WHILE YOU PLAY?

12:58.000 --> 12:59.033
- I DON'T NEED HER.
I'M A MOM.

12:59.066 --> 13:00.033
I CAN DO IT MYSELF.

13:00.066 --> 13:02.367
- UH-HUH.

13:08.433 --> 13:09.700
YOU GOT BUGS IN YOUR EYES.

13:09.734 --> 13:10.700
- WHAT?

13:10.734 --> 13:13.600
- YOU SEE, THE SKELETON RIDERS,

13:13.633 --> 13:15.600
WE GOT THIS SAYING.

13:15.633 --> 13:17.066
"YOU GOT BUGS IN YOUR EYES."

13:17.100 --> 13:18.433
WHAT IT MEANS IS THIS:

13:18.467 --> 13:21.300
YOU CAN'T ALWAYS BE
THE LEAD HOG.

13:21.333 --> 13:23.533
WHEN WE RIDE,
WE RIDE IN FORMATION.

13:23.567 --> 13:25.367
WE TRADE OUT THE LEAD,

13:25.400 --> 13:28.533
'CAUSE IF YOU STAY IN FRONT
OF THE PACK FOR TOO LONG,

13:28.567 --> 13:31.166
YOU GET BUGS IN YOUR EYES.

13:31.200 --> 13:32.533
YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING?

13:32.567 --> 13:35.133
- YEAH, YOU GET A BUNCH
OF DEAD BUGS ON YOUR GOGGLES.

13:35.166 --> 13:39.400
- YOU NEED TO LET OTHER PEOPLE
HELP YOU.

13:39.433 --> 13:42.700
IT DOESN'T MAKE YOU
ANY LESS OF A RIDER.

13:42.734 --> 13:46.700
SO WHY DON'T YOU LET ORTEGA
HOLD THAT BABY

13:46.734 --> 13:48.033
WHILE YOU TAKE YOUR NEXT SHOT?

13:48.066 --> 13:49.300
- [chuckles]

13:49.333 --> 13:50.367
I DON'T...UM...

13:50.400 --> 13:52.100
- HEY, I HAVE 14 KIDS
SPREAD OUT

13:52.133 --> 13:55.467
ACROSS THIS GREAT
WIDE AMERICAN EXPANSE.

13:55.500 --> 13:57.333
I THINK
I KNOW HOW TO HOLD A BABY.

13:57.367 --> 14:00.233
[chuckles]

14:00.266 --> 14:02.600
- OKAY.

14:02.633 --> 14:03.600
- [fussing]

14:03.633 --> 14:06.200
- [shushing]

14:09.100 --> 14:11.066
JUST WATCH HER HEAD.
WATCH HER HEAD.

14:11.100 --> 14:12.066
THERE YOU GO.

14:12.100 --> 14:13.734
- YEAH.
- SHE LIKES TO BE UPRIGHT.

14:13.767 --> 14:14.734
WATCH HER.
THERE WE GO.

14:14.767 --> 14:17.600
- COME TO UNCLE ORTEGA.

14:17.633 --> 14:19.200

14:21.433 --> 14:23.033
AHEM.

[Charlotte fusses]

14:24.500 --> 14:25.467
- GO ON, PLAY.

14:25.500 --> 14:26.533

- AH.

14:31.633 --> 14:33.233
[chuckles]

14:33.266 --> 14:36.467
- I'M ALWAYS TRYING TO MAKE
THINGS RIGHT FOR HER, AND...

14:36.500 --> 14:38.500
IT'S JUST LIKE IT'S MY JOB.

14:38.533 --> 14:40.533
- THINGS ARE GONNA BE OKAY.

14:40.567 --> 14:42.266
- YOU JUST HAVE TO, YOU KNOW,

14:42.300 --> 14:44.233
GO HOME, AND YOU'LL TALK IT OUT.

14:44.266 --> 14:46.567
- I DON'T KNOW.

14:46.600 --> 14:50.066
MAYBE I DON'T WANT TO.

14:50.100 --> 14:53.100
- MARK, I KNOW IT SEEMS
EASIER TO RUN AWAY

14:53.133 --> 14:55.000
WHEN THINGS GET HARD,

14:55.033 --> 14:57.400
BUT I HAVE DONE THAT,

14:57.433 --> 15:00.100
AND TRUST ME,
YOU WILL REGRET IT.

15:02.100 --> 15:04.600
- IT WAS NEVER THIS HARD
WITH YOU AND ME.

15:04.633 --> 15:06.066
- MARK.

15:06.100 --> 15:08.133
- I NEVER, EVER HAD TO WORRY
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

15:08.166 --> 15:10.066
YOU WANTED
WHAT WAS BEST FOR ME.

15:18.033 --> 15:20.633
- MARK, WE WERE SO YOUNG.

15:24.033 --> 15:26.367
LISTEN,

15:26.400 --> 15:28.367
YOU HAVE TO AT LEAST
TRY AND WORK IT OUT.

15:28.400 --> 15:30.533
I KNOW.
I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO.

15:30.567 --> 15:32.667
YOU GOT TO LEAVE IT ALL
ON THE FLOOR.

15:32.700 --> 15:34.166
- LEAVE IT ALL ON THE FLOOR?

15:34.200 --> 15:35.533
WHAT IS THIS,
A GODDAMN DANCE MOVIE?

15:35.567 --> 15:36.567
I'M NOT CHANNING TATUM.

15:36.600 --> 15:37.700
- CAN YOU JUST WORK WITH ME
HERE?

15:37.734 --> 15:39.133
I'M SAYING GOOD STUFF.

15:39.166 --> 15:40.533
- YOU SAID,
"LEAVE IT ALL ON THE FLOOR."

15:40.567 --> 15:42.133
- HEY, HEY, BUDDY.
HEY, THERE HE IS.

15:42.166 --> 15:44.467
YOU LEFT YOUR RING
OVER THERE ON THE TABLE.

15:44.500 --> 15:45.533
YOU ALMOST LEFT WITHOUT IT.

15:45.567 --> 15:47.667
- WHAT? WHY?

15:47.700 --> 15:49.333
- MAGGIE JUST TOLD ME.

15:49.367 --> 15:50.734
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE A COP.

15:50.767 --> 15:52.500
QUE VIVA LA POLICIA!

15:52.533 --> 15:54.100
all: QUE VIVA!

15:54.133 --> 15:56.700
- OH, YEAH.
MUCHAS GRACIAS.

15:56.734 --> 15:58.033
ZIMAS FOR EVERYBODY.

15:58.066 --> 15:59.400

TO GO HOME.

16:02.734 --> 16:04.734
[Mark exhales]

16:08.667 --> 16:12.133
- HEY, LITTLE LADY.
THANKS FOR BAILING ME OUT.

16:12.166 --> 16:13.433
- [cooing]

16:27.500 --> 16:28.533
[chuckles]
AH, MAGS.

16:28.567 --> 16:30.166
I DIDN'T REALIZE
IT WAS LUNCHTIME.

16:30.200 --> 16:31.166
- IT'S OKAY.

16:31.200 --> 16:32.200
YOU HAVE SEEN IT ALL BEFORE.

16:32.233 --> 16:33.266
WHAT'S UP?

16:33.300 --> 16:34.700
TONY JOES GOT THE AMPS
ALL SET UP,

16:34.734 --> 16:36.533
SO I'VE JUST GOT TO GET
THAT PLAYLIST FROM YOU.

16:36.567 --> 16:38.367
- OH, I DID NOT DO THAT.

16:38.400 --> 16:39.367
I'M SORRY.

16:39.400 --> 16:42.066
IS IT TOO LATE FOR BAGPIPES?

16:42.100 --> 16:43.333
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

16:43.367 --> 16:45.100
IT'S NEVER TOO LATE
FOR BAGPIPES.

16:45.133 --> 16:47.633
TONY JOES,
GET YOUR KILT ON!

16:50.667 --> 16:51.633
- OH.

16:51.667 --> 16:53.033
HEY, MARY PAT?

16:53.066 --> 16:55.233
I THINK IT'S TOO EARLY
TO PUT OUT THE CANNOLIS.

16:55.266 --> 16:56.333
THEY'LL SWEAT.

16:59.000 --> 16:59.767
- HEY.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.133
JUST LET MYSELF IN.

17:01.166 --> 17:02.333
- HEY, MARK.

17:02.367 --> 17:04.567
I--I DIDN'T EXPECT TO SEE YOU
THIS EARLY.

17:04.600 --> 17:06.000
- OH, GOD, YEAH,
I HAD A ROUGH TIME

17:06.033 --> 17:07.000
GETTING UP THIS MORNING,

17:07.033 --> 17:08.000
BUT THEN I DIDN'T REALLY--

17:08.033 --> 17:09.133
DIDN'T REALLY GO TO BED, SO...

17:09.166 --> 17:11.200
- DID IT--
DID IT GO OKAY?

17:11.233 --> 17:13.066
- YEAH. YEAH. OH, NO, YEAH.
IT WAS--IT WAS GOOD.

17:13.100 --> 17:14.300
WE'VE DECIDED
WE'RE JUST GONNA--

17:14.333 --> 17:15.433
WE'RE JUST GONNA KEEP TALKING

17:15.467 --> 17:16.667
ABOUT EVERYTHING,
AND, YOU KNOW.

17:16.700 --> 17:17.667
- GOOD.
- MM-HMM.

17:17.700 --> 17:18.734
- GOOD. THAT'S REALLY GOOD.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.300
- AND THANK YOU AGAIN
FOR LAST NIGHT.

17:20.333 --> 17:21.467
- OH.
- YOU KNOW.

17:21.500 --> 17:22.533
- NO, NO.
IT'S MY PLEASURE.

17:22.567 --> 17:24.533
I WOULD DO IT
A THOUSAND TIMES OVER.

17:24.567 --> 17:26.367
- THIS--COULD YOU GIVE
THIS GIFT TO MAGS

17:26.400 --> 17:27.633
OR PUT IN ON THE TABLE
OR WHATEVER?

17:27.667 --> 17:29.567
- YEAH, WHY DON'T YOU JUST
GIVE IT TO HER YOURSELF?

17:29.600 --> 17:30.667
SHE'S JUST UPSTAIRS
WITH THE BABY.

17:30.700 --> 17:32.000
- OH, ACTUALLY,
I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE

17:32.033 --> 17:33.133
TO MAKE IT TO THE CHRISTENING.

17:33.166 --> 17:34.500
- OH, OKAY.
YOU'RE NOT FEELING WELL.

17:34.533 --> 17:36.033
I GET IT.
I'LL TELL MAGGIE.

17:36.066 --> 17:38.333
- I'M ACTUALLY NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO SEE YOU FOR A WHILE.

17:38.367 --> 17:39.767
- WHAT?
- UM...

17:40.000 --> 17:43.400
TINA AND I DECIDED
THAT IT WAS BEST.

17:43.433 --> 17:46.567
AND SO...I'M SORRY.
UM...

17:46.600 --> 17:48.300
I JUST WANTED
TO TELL YOU IN PERSON.

17:48.333 --> 17:51.266
- OH. OKAY.

17:51.300 --> 17:53.667
DID I DO SOMETHING WRONG?
SHOULD I APOLOGIZE?

17:53.700 --> 17:55.000
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
NOT AT ALL.

17:55.033 --> 17:56.233
YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.

17:56.266 --> 17:58.533
- SEÑOR ZIMA, QUE PASO?
- QUE PASO.

17:58.567 --> 18:00.400
- GIMME, GIMME.

18:00.433 --> 18:01.633
- YOU KNOW, I--
I'M JUST GONNA--

18:01.667 --> 18:03.300
I HAVE TO HELP MARY PAT
WITH THE CANNOLI.

18:03.333 --> 18:04.300
- SURE.

18:15.166 --> 18:17.400
- HEY, BUDDY.

18:17.433 --> 18:18.700
YOU OKAY IN THERE?

18:18.734 --> 18:21.100
- [sniffling]
NOT REALLY.

18:21.133 --> 18:24.633
- WANT SOME COMPANY?
- YEAH, MAYBE.

18:31.066 --> 18:33.066
- IT IS ALL RIGHT
IF I BRING HER IN?

18:33.100 --> 18:35.200
THERE AREN'T RACCOONS
IN HERE STILL, ARE THEY?

18:35.233 --> 18:39.166
- NO, THEY'VE MOVED ON.
JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.

18:39.200 --> 18:42.066
- OKAY.

18:42.100 --> 18:44.100
I'M JUST GONNA GET OVER HERE.

18:44.133 --> 18:45.166
OKAY.

18:48.633 --> 18:50.600
HMM.
NO.

18:50.633 --> 18:53.133
- [chuckles] STUPID.

18:53.166 --> 18:55.767
- NO, HE TOLD ME WHAT HE SAID.
- YEAH.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.700
- I'M REALLY PROUD OF YOU.
- WHY?

18:58.734 --> 19:00.734
- FOR DOING THE RIGHT THING
LAST NIGHT.

19:00.767 --> 19:03.066
I KNOW YOU COULD'VE MADE
A VERY DIFFERENT CHOICE.

19:03.100 --> 19:06.400
- YEAH, I COULD'VE MADE OUT
WITH HIM.

19:06.433 --> 19:08.467
I COULD'VE HAD, LIKE--

19:08.500 --> 19:10.233
LIKE A SUPER HOT MAKE-OUT
WITH HIM.

19:10.266 --> 19:11.233
- BUT YOU DIDN'T.

19:11.266 --> 19:12.333
- I JUST FEEL

19:12.367 --> 19:14.600
LIKE EVERYBODY HAS SOMEONE,
YOU KNOW?

19:14.633 --> 19:15.734
MARK HAS BIRD BONES,

19:15.767 --> 19:19.166
AND BRUCE HAS HIS STUPID COUSIN,
TONY JOES.

19:19.200 --> 19:20.600
YOU HAVE THE BABY.

19:20.633 --> 19:21.767
WHO HATES ME, BY THE WAY.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.433
- OH, COME ON.
SHE DOESN'T HATE YOU.

19:23.467 --> 19:24.633
- SHE DOES.

19:24.667 --> 19:28.066
SHE'S GIVING ME THE STINK EYE
RIGHT NOW.

19:28.100 --> 19:30.367
- THAT'S JUST HER FACE.

19:30.400 --> 19:32.233
I THINK MAYBE
THAT'S MY FAULT,

19:32.266 --> 19:37.633
'CAUSE I HAVEN'T REALLY
LET YOU OR ANYBODY HELP.

19:37.667 --> 19:41.467
BUT YOU DO HAVE HER AND ME,
OKAY?

19:41.500 --> 19:43.166
AND YOU ARE
A PART OF THIS FAMILY.

19:43.200 --> 19:45.500
YOU ARE ALWAYS
A PART OF THIS FAMILY.

19:45.533 --> 19:47.400
- I KNOW.

19:53.266 --> 19:56.100
- I WASN'T GONNA DO THIS
UNTIL THE CHRISTENING,

19:56.133 --> 19:57.433
'CAUSE I WANTED TO
SURPRISE YOU,

19:57.467 --> 19:59.400
BUT HERE.

19:59.433 --> 20:00.400
- WHAT IS THIS?

20:00.433 --> 20:02.734
- CHARLOTTE'S BIRTH CERTIFICATE.

20:02.767 --> 20:05.000
LOOK AT HER NAME.

20:05.033 --> 20:08.367
- CHARLOTTE EMMA CARUSO?

20:08.400 --> 20:11.133
HER MIDDLE NAME IS EMMA?
- IT IS.

20:11.166 --> 20:12.133
- THAT'S MY NAME.

20:12.166 --> 20:13.433
- [laughing]
I KNOW.

20:13.467 --> 20:16.700
BRUCE AND I WANT YOU
TO ALWAYS BE A PART OF HER LIFE,

20:16.734 --> 20:18.433
BECAUSE YOU ARE MORE
THAN A GODMOTHER,

20:18.467 --> 20:22.433
YOU ARE A PART OF
WHO SHE IS, OKAY?

20:22.467 --> 20:25.300
AND YOU WILL ALWAYS
BE PART OF THIS FAMILY, OKAY?

20:25.333 --> 20:26.300
- OKAY.
- IS THAT OKAY?

20:26.333 --> 20:27.300
- YEAH, THAT'S OKAY.

20:27.333 --> 20:28.367
- [cooing]

20:28.400 --> 20:30.200
- YOU HEAR THAT, STINK EYE?

20:30.233 --> 20:31.467
YOU'RE STUCK WITH ME NOW
FOREVER.

20:31.500 --> 20:33.166
[both laugh]

20:33.200 --> 20:34.233
- OH, GREAT.

20:34.266 --> 20:35.567
THE SIGHT OF MY TEARS
MAKES HER SMILE.

20:35.600 --> 20:36.700
THAT'S NICE.

20:36.734 --> 20:38.667
- YOU DO MAKE A CRAZY FACE
WHEN YOU CRY.

20:38.700 --> 20:39.667
JUST SO YOU KNOW--

20:39.700 --> 20:40.667
YOU KNOW, AT THIS STAGE,

20:40.700 --> 20:41.667
THEY DON'T REALLY SMILE.

20:41.700 --> 20:42.734
IT'S PROBABLY JUST GAS.

20:42.767 --> 20:44.767
- CAN YOU JUST LET ME HAVE THIS,
OKAY?

20:45.000 --> 20:46.500
- OKAY.

20:46.533 --> 20:47.500
- MAY I HAVE A HUG?

20:47.533 --> 20:50.000
- OKAY, THREE-WAY HUG.
