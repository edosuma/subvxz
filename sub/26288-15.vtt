00:04.102 --> 00:06.136
<i>I said double-time it!</i>

00:06.204 --> 00:08.838
Is that all you got?
Come on! Right now.

00:08.907 --> 00:12.008
Pick up the pace,
you pathetic pollywogs!

00:12.077 --> 00:14.210
You will never be accepted

00:14.279 --> 00:16.713
into the Kingdom of Neptune
at this rate!

00:16.782 --> 00:18.048
Rotate!

00:21.286 --> 00:23.953
Being welcomed
into the mysteries of the deep

00:24.022 --> 00:25.855
is an honor!
It is a privilege

00:25.924 --> 00:27.490
that must be earned.

00:27.559 --> 00:30.360
I thought crossing the equator
was supposed to be fun.

00:30.429 --> 00:33.129
This is worse
than boot camp!

00:33.198 --> 00:35.965
What say you,
esteemed Shellbacks?

00:36.034 --> 00:38.368
Have they proven themselves
worthy?

00:38.437 --> 00:41.704
Nay!

00:41.773 --> 00:44.040
You heard them.
Figure eights!

00:44.109 --> 00:46.643
You got to be kidding me.

00:46.711 --> 00:48.478
Brown! Those who dare defy

00:48.547 --> 00:51.481
the king of Neptune end
up in Davy Jones' Locker.

00:53.652 --> 00:55.518
Man overboard!

00:56.822 --> 00:57.987
Man overboard!

00:58.090 --> 00:59.255
Starboard side!

00:59.324 --> 01:00.824
Report to your
muster stations, now!

Yeah, yeah, I know I'm late.

01:38.964 --> 01:41.798
The MPD, uh, cop
I hooked up with last month

01:41.833 --> 01:45.568
gave me a--
a jaywalking ticket this morning

01:45.637 --> 01:48.471
and, uh, well...
talk about a scorned woman.

01:49.975 --> 01:51.941
Nice.

01:52.010 --> 01:54.110
All right,
that would be a whoops.

01:54.179 --> 01:56.079
Thank you for that illuminating

01:56.148 --> 01:58.414
and highly inappropriate
recap, Agent Torres.

01:58.483 --> 01:59.949
Uh, Director, I, uh...

02:00.018 --> 02:01.384
did not see you standing there.

02:03.021 --> 02:04.654
And by hooked up, I meant, like,

02:04.723 --> 02:05.955
you know, we
get together

02:06.024 --> 02:07.290
and discuss a case.

02:07.359 --> 02:08.991
We know what
hooking up means.

02:09.060 --> 02:11.227
We're 17.
Not seven.

02:11.296 --> 02:14.497
Well, this mentorship is
off to a fantastic start.

02:14.566 --> 02:16.166
Wait, I'm sorry.

02:16.234 --> 02:17.567
Say what?

02:17.636 --> 02:18.968
Mentorship?

02:19.037 --> 02:21.771
Agent Torres, I'd like
for you to meet the winners

02:21.840 --> 02:24.307
of NCIS's essay
outreach contest.

02:24.376 --> 02:27.644
This is Hayley,
Blake and Max.

02:27.712 --> 02:30.113
They'll be shadowing you
for the next two days.

02:32.884 --> 02:34.417
Okay, okay.

02:34.486 --> 02:35.985
That was pretty good.

02:36.054 --> 02:38.254
You find that amusing,
Agent Torres?

02:38.323 --> 02:41.090
Oh, you... you're being serious.

02:41.159 --> 02:42.159
Mm-hmm.

02:42.227 --> 02:43.993
Um...

02:44.062 --> 02:45.995
Director, may I
have a word with you?

02:46.064 --> 02:48.998
Uh, see, Gibbs,
McGee and Bishop,

02:49.067 --> 02:51.601
they're the ones who
volunteered to be a mentor.

02:51.670 --> 02:53.937
Not me. Because, like...

02:54.005 --> 02:55.772
not my thing.

02:55.840 --> 02:59.342
Seeing as they're on a helo
en route to the USS <i>Ewing,</i>

02:59.411 --> 03:01.844
their assignment
now falls to you.

03:03.014 --> 03:05.548
You three are in
very good hands.

03:05.617 --> 03:07.684
And I'm certain that
Agent Torres will

03:07.752 --> 03:09.953
do his very
best to give you

03:10.021 --> 03:12.956
a proper introduction
into life at NCIS.

03:13.024 --> 03:15.124
As if his job depended on it.

03:15.193 --> 03:16.392
Sir.

03:21.032 --> 03:22.712
- You sure you're a real agent?
- Yeah.

03:22.767 --> 03:23.866
Why?

03:23.935 --> 03:25.702
You're wearing
a T-shirt.

03:25.770 --> 03:27.971
A women's small,
from the looks of it.

03:29.241 --> 03:30.673
Don't you own a suit?

03:30.742 --> 03:32.342
Um, outdated much?

03:32.410 --> 03:34.310
Agents are only required
to wear suits

03:34.379 --> 03:35.912
for court or formal proceedings.

03:35.981 --> 03:38.181
Yeah. What she said.

03:38.250 --> 03:39.527
We're looking forward
to this, sir.

03:40.885 --> 03:43.019
Consider us sponges
ready to absorb

03:43.088 --> 03:45.355
all the knowledge
you have to impart on us.

03:45.423 --> 03:47.023
Did you just call me "sir"?

03:47.092 --> 03:48.391
Yes, sir.

03:48.460 --> 03:50.994
Actually, that does have
a nice ring to it. Hmm.

03:51.062 --> 03:53.196
What's first on the agenda,
Agent Torres?

03:53.265 --> 03:55.531
Agenda...

03:55.600 --> 03:57.367
Yeah, okay.

03:59.471 --> 04:01.204
A coffee.
One sugar.

04:01.273 --> 04:03.039
On it.

04:04.976 --> 04:07.744
And for your information,
this is a compression T-shirt.

04:09.180 --> 04:11.381
It increases circulation.

04:12.817 --> 04:14.284
Keep telling yourself that.

04:18.322 --> 04:20.589
Anyone else feel like
they're in the middle

04:20.659 --> 04:22.059
of a <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i>
movie?

04:22.093 --> 04:23.259
Arr!

04:23.328 --> 04:26.296
You know what?
Loving the costumes.

04:26.364 --> 04:28.431
Yeah, it's part
of the Shellback ceremony.

04:28.500 --> 04:29.899
It's a Navy tradition

04:29.968 --> 04:31.288
when the ship
crosses the equator.

04:31.336 --> 04:33.469
What's this stuff all over
the deck? Are these, uh,

04:33.538 --> 04:34.937
eggs that are dyed green?

04:35.006 --> 04:37.106
Yeah. Also part of the ritual.

04:37.175 --> 04:39.208
How very Dr. Seussian.

04:39.277 --> 04:40.477
How about your dad?
Did he ever

04:40.512 --> 04:41.756
participate in one
of these ceremonies

04:41.780 --> 04:43.112
when he was in the Navy?

04:43.181 --> 04:44.492
Oh, this is nothing
compared to what

04:44.516 --> 04:46.127
my dad went through
when he was a pollywog.

04:46.151 --> 04:48.117
Yeah? What'd they make him do?

04:48.186 --> 04:49.752
Please don't say "eat raw eggs."

04:49.821 --> 04:51.054
Crew threw him overboard.

04:51.122 --> 04:52.622
Made him swim back
to the ship.

04:52.691 --> 04:54.571
It's okay, though.
Navy doesn't do that anymore.

04:55.560 --> 04:57.093
You sure about that?

04:59.230 --> 05:01.998
The victim's Petty Officer
First Class Kendrick Allston.

05:02.067 --> 05:04.000
He was one
of our cryptologic techs.

05:04.069 --> 05:05.768
How long has he
been on board?

05:05.837 --> 05:07.303
Little more
than four years.

05:07.372 --> 05:08.771
Longer than I've been here.

05:08.840 --> 05:09.972
You know him well?

05:10.041 --> 05:11.941
Better than most.

05:12.010 --> 05:14.310
He was one of the brightest
sailors I'd ever been around.

05:14.379 --> 05:16.819
Would've staked my career on him
making it to admiral one day.

05:16.881 --> 05:19.449
How long until he
was retrieved from the water?

05:19.517 --> 05:22.018
One minute and 56 seconds
from the time he was spotted.

05:22.087 --> 05:24.287
I know that man-overboards
happen at sea,

05:24.356 --> 05:26.289
but nothing like this
has ever occurred

05:26.358 --> 05:27.790
under my command before.

05:27.859 --> 05:29.492
I want answers
just as much as you do.

05:29.561 --> 05:32.628
Gibbs, no one who was
on deck at the time saw

05:32.697 --> 05:34.931
how or when Petty Officer
Allston fell overboard.

05:34.999 --> 05:37.100
Then find the last
person to see him alive.

05:37.168 --> 05:38.568
There's no need
to dance around this

05:38.603 --> 05:40.336
on my account, agents.

05:40.405 --> 05:43.172
You have something
else to add, Commander?

05:43.241 --> 05:44.607
Just that I agree with

05:44.676 --> 05:45.986
what you're probably
already suspecting.

05:46.010 --> 05:47.588
That what happened
to Petty Officer Allston

05:47.612 --> 05:49.178
wasn't an accident.

05:49.247 --> 05:50.780
Why do you say that?

05:50.849 --> 05:52.682
The likelihood
of him drowning...

05:52.751 --> 05:54.050
is slim to none.

05:54.119 --> 05:55.718
Allston was a search
and rescue swimmer.

05:55.787 --> 05:57.120
Even so,

05:57.188 --> 05:58.532
the impact of him
hitting the water

05:58.556 --> 05:59.956
could have knocked him
unconscious.

06:00.024 --> 06:02.158
It was a fall
that he had done dozens of times

06:02.227 --> 06:03.826
in training
and it never affected him.

06:03.895 --> 06:05.795
Something else
must have happened to him.

06:05.864 --> 06:07.063
Boss?

06:18.810 --> 06:20.376
- What do we got?
- Blunt force trauma.

06:20.445 --> 06:22.478
He was definitely struck
in the back of the head.

06:22.547 --> 06:25.248
- By what?
- Well, that's the weird part.

06:25.316 --> 06:28.151
You see these five indentations
around the wound?

06:28.219 --> 06:30.153
They are all
the exact same

06:30.221 --> 06:31.782
depth and diameter.

06:31.806 --> 06:32.656
Get to the weird part.

06:32.657 --> 06:35.358
Well, I've only seen an injury
like this one other place.

06:35.427 --> 06:37.393
It was in a medical
textbook where the victim

06:37.462 --> 06:39.395
was killed by a, uh...

06:39.464 --> 06:41.497
well, he was killed
by a medieval flail.

06:41.566 --> 06:43.699
You know the stick
where chains attach,

06:43.768 --> 06:46.335
got a little spiked ball on it?
- Yeah, yeah. I got it, McGee.

06:46.404 --> 06:49.405
I'd say that definitely
puts this in the weird category.

06:59.223 --> 07:01.256
With Allston's body
headed to NCIS,

07:01.325 --> 07:02.925
what kind of timeline
are we looking at?

07:02.993 --> 07:04.660
Till we get a cause of death,

07:04.728 --> 07:07.062
your ship's in
a holding pattern, Commander.

07:07.131 --> 07:08.542
Mission deadlines aren't
my concern, Agent Gibbs.

07:08.566 --> 07:09.798
It's the safety
of my crew.

07:09.867 --> 07:11.378
If there's a murderer on
board, I want him found.

07:11.402 --> 07:13.135
What can I do
to expedite things?

07:13.204 --> 07:15.637
We'll need access
to the entire ship.

07:15.706 --> 07:17.150
Including Petty Officer
Allston's quarters.

07:17.174 --> 07:18.907
Well, the master-at-arms
sealed off

07:18.976 --> 07:20.387
his rack and footlocker
this morning.

07:20.411 --> 07:22.611
I'll see to the rest.

07:22.680 --> 07:23.912
<i>To be honest,</i>

07:23.981 --> 07:25.814
yes, I am shocked.

07:25.883 --> 07:28.083
Why?
What do you mean, "why"?

07:28.152 --> 07:29.729
Everybody knows
you're terrible with teenagers.

07:29.753 --> 07:31.486
- Really?
- Oh, okay.

07:31.555 --> 07:34.289
Keep me posted.

07:34.358 --> 07:35.490
So what's so shocking?

07:35.559 --> 07:37.192
Oh, Torres says
he's got a handle

07:37.261 --> 07:38.794
on this mentoring thing.

07:38.862 --> 07:40.262
Yeah, that doesn't sound right.

07:40.364 --> 07:42.264
Hey, what do we know?

07:42.333 --> 07:44.866
Well, my sweep of the decks
turned up no sign

07:44.935 --> 07:46.335
of where Allston
was hit in the head

07:46.370 --> 07:47.936
or where he went overboard.

07:48.005 --> 07:49.645
Torres is briefing
Petty Officer Allston's

07:49.673 --> 07:51.273
next of kin.
- Background?

07:51.342 --> 07:53.542
Uh, Kendrick Allston, 24.

07:53.611 --> 07:55.644
Born and raised
in Wheeling, West Virginia.

07:55.713 --> 07:58.780
Graduated top of
his high school class before enlisting.

07:58.849 --> 08:00.549
Not a single blemish
on his record.

08:00.618 --> 08:02.551
He was a rising star,

08:02.620 --> 08:04.386
rose from the rank
of seaman recruit

08:04.455 --> 08:06.433
to first class petty officer
in less than six years.

08:06.457 --> 08:08.957
Practically unheard of.
Must have made a lot of friends.

08:09.026 --> 08:11.627
And at least one enemy.
McGee, you're with me.

08:11.695 --> 08:13.662
Bishop, start
interviewing the crew.

08:13.731 --> 08:15.397
Find out who had
issues with Allston.

08:15.466 --> 08:16.798
Boss, what about Torres?

08:16.867 --> 08:18.667
Oh, he's got his hands full.

08:21.939 --> 08:24.373
Do you plan on doing
any work today

08:24.441 --> 08:26.208
or are you just
pure window dressing?

08:26.277 --> 08:28.176
Don't let my ridiculous
good looks fool you.

08:28.245 --> 08:29.678
I get the job done.

08:30.881 --> 08:32.581
You know what?

08:32.650 --> 08:34.850
You're right. Update time.

08:36.754 --> 08:38.220
Show me what you got.

08:38.289 --> 08:39.587
Yes, sir.

08:39.657 --> 08:41.256
So, per your instructions,

08:41.325 --> 08:43.158
I organized all your
quarterly expense reports

08:43.227 --> 08:45.560
and submitted them to accounting
in addition to preparing

08:45.629 --> 08:47.496
- your tax return for this year.
- Hmm.

08:47.564 --> 08:48.830
Business write-offs?

08:48.899 --> 08:50.198
Taken care of, sir.

08:50.267 --> 08:52.200
Not bad, not bad.
Hales, you're up.

08:52.269 --> 08:55.270
I organized,
collated and archived

08:55.339 --> 08:56.838
all non-classified reports.

08:56.907 --> 08:57.907
Using shortcut tabs

08:57.975 --> 08:59.341
to maximize efficiency.

08:59.410 --> 09:01.510
Whoo! We're on
a roll, baby.

09:01.578 --> 09:03.545
Max, bring us home.

09:13.023 --> 09:14.856
Yo, I said no cell phones.

09:19.997 --> 09:21.997
Happy?

09:22.032 --> 09:23.398
Well, that depends.

09:23.434 --> 09:25.133
What is the status
of my jaywalking appeal?

09:25.202 --> 09:27.369
How should I know?

09:27.438 --> 09:28.804
That was your assignment.

09:28.872 --> 09:30.405
Hmm. Pass.

09:30.474 --> 09:31.873
Pass.

09:31.942 --> 09:35.477
Agents don't get to choose
or pick their assignments.

09:35.546 --> 09:37.212
They do the job they're given.

09:38.849 --> 09:40.148
I'm here to learn.

09:40.217 --> 09:42.417
Not to be your errand boy.

09:42.486 --> 09:44.086
I agree.

09:44.154 --> 09:46.588
Agent Torres.
A word?

09:49.660 --> 09:51.093
Sir?

09:51.161 --> 09:53.095
You mind telling me
what you're doing?

09:53.163 --> 09:54.629
Mentoring, sir.

09:54.698 --> 09:56.398
Today's lesson
is about how an agent

09:56.467 --> 09:58.567
can get stuck with work
they didn't ask for.

10:00.003 --> 10:01.470
Hypothetically speaking,
of course.

10:01.538 --> 10:04.005
Well, unless you wish
to pull weekend duty

10:04.074 --> 10:06.007
for the next
three months,

10:06.076 --> 10:08.110
I would suggest that you start

10:08.178 --> 10:09.644
showing them the ropes
around here.

10:10.814 --> 10:11.814
Great!

10:11.849 --> 10:14.816
So, where to
next, boss?

10:14.885 --> 10:16.118
What about checking out MTAC?

10:16.186 --> 10:17.419
Or the cyber
division?

10:17.488 --> 10:19.287
Ooh! Can we go
into the field with you?

10:19.356 --> 10:20.658
Ooh, yeah, I like that,
let's do that, yeah. Yeah.

10:20.682 --> 10:21.824
That's a good one. Yeah.

10:25.062 --> 10:26.695
Sir?

10:26.764 --> 10:29.865
Give me a minute.

10:31.001 --> 10:32.501
<i>Hey, boss,</i>

10:32.569 --> 10:35.604
look at this locker,
not a single item out of place.

10:35.672 --> 10:37.372
His rack's
inspection-ready.

10:38.509 --> 10:40.175
Bounce a quarter off that sheet.

10:40.244 --> 10:43.278
Allston was one
squared-away sailor.

10:43.347 --> 10:44.379
Who is that?

10:44.448 --> 10:45.947
Girlfriend?

10:46.016 --> 10:48.550
Sister?
I'll find out.

10:48.619 --> 10:50.019
So you were
the first sailor

10:50.087 --> 10:51.486
to spot Allston
in the water?

10:51.555 --> 10:54.623
Yes, ma'am. Although I did not
know it was him at the time.

10:54.691 --> 10:56.903
Any reason you forgot to mention
you were also his bunkmate?

10:56.927 --> 10:59.294
I didn't think
that was important.

11:00.697 --> 11:02.731
Why is it?

11:02.800 --> 11:05.000
When's the last time
you saw him?

11:05.068 --> 11:06.802
Earlier that morning,
before the ceremony.

11:06.870 --> 11:09.004
He was laying in
his rack before watch.

11:09.072 --> 11:10.839
Was he acting
differently?

11:10.908 --> 11:12.674
No, not that
I could tell.

11:12.743 --> 11:14.954
Did he ever confide in you
in any problems he was having?

11:14.978 --> 11:17.479
No, but I wouldn't
expect him to.

11:17.548 --> 11:19.481
He and I weren't
exactly friends.

11:19.550 --> 11:21.216
So who was he friends with?

11:21.285 --> 11:23.652
Allston wasn't close
with anyone.

11:23.720 --> 11:25.086
All he cared about was work.

11:25.155 --> 11:27.656
- What about enemies?
- I doubt it. I mean,

11:27.724 --> 11:29.558
he may have been
a buzzkill at times,

11:29.626 --> 11:33.061
but he was still a good guy.
We all knew that.

11:34.832 --> 11:37.399
The line-crossing ceremony
is really quite fascinating.

11:37.468 --> 11:39.868
Did you know it's a sailing
tradition that dates back

11:39.937 --> 11:43.038
over 400 years?

11:43.106 --> 11:45.207
Fascinating.

11:45.275 --> 11:47.843
You doing okay?
You look exhausted.

11:47.911 --> 11:50.212
I mean, the bags
under your eyes...

11:50.280 --> 11:52.414
Bags? What bags?
What're you talking about?

11:53.650 --> 11:54.883
Ah...

11:54.952 --> 11:56.785
It's those damn kids, man.

11:56.854 --> 11:58.854
They running you
ragged, huh?

11:58.922 --> 12:01.389
I know you're no good
with teenagers.

12:01.425 --> 12:02.958
Why does everybody keep
saying that?

12:02.993 --> 12:05.393
I am a seasoned
law enforcement agent.

12:05.462 --> 12:06.895
Nothing fazes me, son.

12:06.964 --> 12:09.064
Where are your little mentees?

12:09.132 --> 12:12.868
Up in the lab learning military
strategy and combat tactics.

12:12.936 --> 12:14.069
Oh.

12:14.137 --> 12:16.571
- Wait, what?
- Don't overthink it.

12:16.640 --> 12:18.740
What's the
cause of death?

12:18.809 --> 12:22.310
Prepare yourself because
it is rather unexpected.

12:22.379 --> 12:24.980
Petty Officer Allston's
cause of death

12:25.048 --> 12:26.615
was not drowning, nor was it

12:26.683 --> 12:28.617
a blunt force trauma
to the head.

12:28.685 --> 12:31.653
Nick, he died of a
sudden cardiac arrest.

12:31.722 --> 12:35.090
A heart attack? At 24?

12:35.158 --> 12:37.626
Even stranger considering
he has no familial history

12:37.694 --> 12:38.927
of heart issues.

12:38.996 --> 12:41.563
I'm still awaiting the results
of his blood panel,

12:41.632 --> 12:44.499
but...
a massive cardiac episode

12:44.568 --> 12:46.801
could give another explanation
to his head wound.

12:46.870 --> 12:48.670
So he wasn't struck from behind?

12:48.739 --> 12:50.438
Upon closer inspection,

12:50.507 --> 12:54.342
I found that the
wound pattern is not that

12:54.411 --> 12:58.580
of a medieval flail,
but rather bulkhead piping

12:58.649 --> 13:00.315
from a Navy destroyer.

13:00.384 --> 13:02.817
So he was hit
with a piece of the ship?

13:02.886 --> 13:06.454
Possibly, or he accidentally
hit his head and fell overboard.

13:06.523 --> 13:08.990
Nicholas Torres!

13:09.059 --> 13:11.493
- Uh, what's up, Kasie?
- Oh!

13:11.562 --> 13:13.128
I'll tell you what's up.

13:13.196 --> 13:14.796
Kasie, Kasie,
wh-what-what's

13:14.865 --> 13:16.464
that noise?
We can barely hear you.

13:16.533 --> 13:19.134
Torres, my lab now!

13:20.404 --> 13:22.003
She didn't sound
too happy, did she?

13:22.072 --> 13:24.673
No. Good luck, buddy.

13:24.741 --> 13:26.708
Yeah.

13:30.180 --> 13:31.691
Blake, I need you
on backup on this one.

13:31.715 --> 13:33.315
- Huh? No.
- Come on!

13:33.383 --> 13:35.850
Dude.
I don't see how this game

13:35.919 --> 13:38.687
is educational.
It's a team-building experience.

13:38.755 --> 13:41.022
Yeah, so is a trust fall,
and that's quiet.

13:41.091 --> 13:42.958
Yo, yo, I'm here, I'm here.
What's the problem?

13:43.026 --> 13:45.060
I'm sorry, what's
that? Uh-uh...

13:45.128 --> 13:47.996
The blood filling my ears
must be affecting my hearing.

13:48.065 --> 13:50.498
That's the problem.

13:50.567 --> 13:52.467
I have work to do,
and I can't concentrate

13:52.536 --> 13:55.203
with the sounds of D-Day
going on in here.

13:55.272 --> 13:56.838
This is not what
we agreed upon.

13:56.907 --> 13:58.139
Kasie, you have to
help me out.

13:58.208 --> 14:00.219
I got to stash them somewhere
so I can get some work done.

14:00.243 --> 14:01.576
Okay, you know what?

14:01.645 --> 14:04.512
That sounds like a Torres
problem, not a Kasie problem.

14:04.581 --> 14:06.881
You think I don't have
anything better to do, huh?

14:06.950 --> 14:08.650
Than to babysit
annoying

14:08.719 --> 14:11.486
wannabe teenage agents?

14:11.555 --> 14:13.722
Where did he
come from?

14:13.790 --> 14:15.390
Break room.

14:15.459 --> 14:17.325
- Thanks for the cash.
- What cash?

14:19.630 --> 14:21.162
Your snack machine sucks.

14:21.231 --> 14:24.265
Okay, the wallet swipe,
that's my thing.

14:24.334 --> 14:26.067
And you owe me
60 cents.

14:26.136 --> 14:27.580
That should be the result

14:27.604 --> 14:29.604
of Petty Officer Allston's
blood work.

14:34.978 --> 14:37.412
Technically, this is
the second analysis.

14:37.447 --> 14:39.714
The initial results
were so off the charts,

14:39.783 --> 14:41.383
I had to verify
the data.

14:41.451 --> 14:43.051
Oh, boy.

14:43.120 --> 14:44.519
Are the results different?

14:44.588 --> 14:47.188
Uh, unfortunately, no.
Allston had

14:47.257 --> 14:50.291
high levels of amphetamines
and lysergic acid diethylamide

14:50.360 --> 14:53.028
in his system.
His cardiac arrest

14:53.096 --> 14:54.596
was the result
of a drug overdose.

14:54.665 --> 14:56.431
But everything we have
on this guy says

14:56.500 --> 14:58.400
he was as straightlaced
as they come.

14:58.468 --> 15:01.403
Yeah, well, I mean, everybody's
got a skeleton in their closet.

15:01.471 --> 15:03.938
His was a lethal one.

15:11.556 --> 15:13.577
Oh, thank God
you guys are back.

15:13.578 --> 15:15.344
What? What're you doing?

15:15.413 --> 15:17.880
Please don't ever
leave me again like that.

15:17.949 --> 15:19.515
Those kids are
driving me crazy, man.

15:19.584 --> 15:20.883
The mentees?

15:20.952 --> 15:23.052
It takes less energy
to infiltrate a drug cartel.

15:23.121 --> 15:25.354
I pawned them off
on a probie just so

15:25.423 --> 15:26.856
I can have a few hours
of "me time."

15:26.925 --> 15:28.291
How about
"update time"?

15:28.359 --> 15:30.259
Yeah, and that, too.

15:30.328 --> 15:31.794
I contacted
Allston's sister.

15:31.863 --> 15:33.629
She's on her way in.

15:33.698 --> 15:34.964
Where's, uh,
where's Bishop?

15:35.033 --> 15:36.465
Running point on the ship.

15:36.534 --> 15:38.534
What about the drugs
in Allston's system?

15:38.603 --> 15:40.736
According to Kasie,
it's some kind of, uh,

15:40.805 --> 15:43.639
synthetic combination
of hallucinogens and stimulants.

15:43.708 --> 15:45.408
It's called
a Tri-Shot.

15:45.476 --> 15:46.909
Well, at least

15:46.978 --> 15:48.359
that's what the kids
at my school call it.

15:48.383 --> 15:49.546
Mine, too.

15:49.547 --> 15:52.381
Why are you not
with Agent Ventura?

15:52.450 --> 15:55.251
She went to look for Max.
He wandered off again.

15:55.320 --> 15:57.153
Torres, go find him.

15:58.890 --> 16:01.591
You two, keep talking.

16:01.659 --> 16:03.926
I mean, there's not really
much else I can say.

16:03.995 --> 16:06.395
I've never really done
Tri-Shots myself.

16:06.464 --> 16:08.764
Well, you use a dropper
to ingest it.

16:08.833 --> 16:10.533
One or two drops
should do the trick.

16:10.602 --> 16:12.568
Any more than that,
you'll wind up in the ER.

16:14.505 --> 16:17.073
I mean, from
what I've heard.

16:17.141 --> 16:18.741
We're not really
into that kind of stuff.

16:18.810 --> 16:21.243
Yeah, uh, Zico and B.I.
are more my vice.

16:21.312 --> 16:23.546
The hell is that?

16:23.615 --> 16:26.882
Seriously? It's K-hip hop.

16:26.918 --> 16:28.384
What the hell is that?

16:29.487 --> 16:31.787
Tragic.

16:38.296 --> 16:40.596
Hey, there. Can I help you?

16:40.665 --> 16:41.797
No.

16:43.835 --> 16:46.435
Uh, okay.

16:46.504 --> 16:49.138
Uh, let's try this one:

16:49.207 --> 16:51.807
who are you?
- Max.

16:51.876 --> 16:54.276
Oh, sorry, you must be
one of the essay winners.

16:54.345 --> 16:55.711
I'm Agent Jack Sloane.

16:57.682 --> 17:00.149
You're new here, am I right?

17:00.218 --> 17:02.118
Not exactly.

17:08.192 --> 17:09.791
Ah.

17:09.861 --> 17:11.594
You like that?

17:11.663 --> 17:14.163
I, uh, got it in Austria.

17:14.232 --> 17:15.631
What do you think?

17:15.700 --> 17:17.666
You want an honest answer?

17:17.734 --> 17:19.669
Always.

17:19.737 --> 17:21.604
It doesn't fit.

17:21.673 --> 17:23.105
Hmm.

17:25.410 --> 17:27.076
Hey, take one.

17:27.145 --> 17:28.577
Why?

17:28.646 --> 17:30.579
Come on, dude, just humor me.

17:33.618 --> 17:36.318
Aha. Black licorice.
Interesting.

17:36.387 --> 17:37.953
You gonna analyze me now?

17:38.022 --> 17:41.824
I could, or you could just
tell me why you're here.

17:41.893 --> 17:44.660
Essay winners get to shadow
an NCIS agent.

17:44.729 --> 17:46.662
I mean the real reason.

17:48.066 --> 17:50.533
Why are you here, Max?

17:52.370 --> 17:53.969
Yo, my man.

17:54.038 --> 17:56.172
What about "stay put"
don't you get?

17:56.240 --> 17:57.807
I'm not a dog.

17:57.875 --> 18:01.177
I know 'cause dogs listen,
and if you don't,

18:01.245 --> 18:02.645
I'll try a different method.

18:02.714 --> 18:04.680
Nick, is that really necessary?

18:04.749 --> 18:06.849
Jack, teenagers
are like raptors, okay?

18:06.918 --> 18:08.050
They smell fear.

18:08.119 --> 18:10.319
You have to
stay strong.

18:10.388 --> 18:13.656
Come on, move it.
Come on.

18:13.725 --> 18:14.857
Bye, Max.

18:17.528 --> 18:20.029
<i>We're sorry for your loss,</i>

18:20.098 --> 18:21.530
Miss Allston.

18:21.599 --> 18:23.699
So how did this happen?

18:23.768 --> 18:25.701
Your brother overdosed.

18:25.770 --> 18:28.704
That's not possible.

18:28.773 --> 18:30.573
A fatal amount

18:30.641 --> 18:32.141
of a synthetic drug

18:32.210 --> 18:33.843
was found in his system.

18:35.780 --> 18:38.881
You're wrong. I-I would've known
if my brother was doing drugs.

18:38.950 --> 18:41.016
Well, he could've been
keeping it from you.

18:42.320 --> 18:44.520
Opioids decimated our hometown.

18:44.589 --> 18:47.423
Kendrick was determined
to escape that life.

18:47.492 --> 18:50.659
Someone must've set him up.

18:50.728 --> 18:52.828
Why would
they do that?

18:52.897 --> 18:56.098
Being the C.O.'s favorite
made him a target.

18:57.502 --> 18:59.368
You have a name for us?

18:59.437 --> 19:02.838
Andrew Townsley.

19:04.275 --> 19:05.741
He was a sailor
on board the <i>Ewing.</i>

19:05.810 --> 19:08.377
He had been harassing
my brother for weeks.

19:08.446 --> 19:11.547
I should've stepped in
and done something,

19:11.616 --> 19:14.583
but Kendrick said he wanted
to fight his own battles.

19:17.855 --> 19:20.356
<i>Man, it feels so good</i>
<i>to be on the field.</i>

19:20.424 --> 19:23.626
In a few more hours, this
mentoring thing will be over.

19:23.694 --> 19:25.394
It's been two days.

19:25.463 --> 19:27.363
Exactly.

19:27.431 --> 19:28.745
What's this guy's story?

19:28.746 --> 19:32.635
Well, Andrew Townsley,
22 years old.

19:32.703 --> 19:34.615
Discharged six months ago
when he popped positive

19:34.639 --> 19:36.605
for a ship-wide
drug test.

19:36.674 --> 19:39.074
Says here that he was
brought up to captain's mast,

19:39.143 --> 19:41.744
where he punched
his superior.

19:41.813 --> 19:44.446
- This guy's a winner.
- Yep.

19:44.515 --> 19:47.783
There he is. Andrew Townsley?

19:47.852 --> 19:49.151
Who wants to know?

19:49.220 --> 19:50.886
NCIS.

19:50.955 --> 19:54.757
Use context clues, idiots.

19:54.826 --> 19:56.792
Can't you see I'm not
in the Navy anymore?

19:56.861 --> 20:00.062
I'm sure they're reeling
from the loss.

20:00.131 --> 20:01.664
This guy
look familiar?

20:01.732 --> 20:05.267
Yeah, what did the Boy Scout
rat me out for this time?

20:05.336 --> 20:08.103
Hmm? Stealing gum
from the ship's store?

20:08.172 --> 20:10.639
You know what, you tell Allston
if he has a problem with me,

20:10.708 --> 20:12.107
he can say it to my face.

20:12.176 --> 20:14.977
We would... if he wasn't dead.

20:15.046 --> 20:16.278
Dead?

20:19.584 --> 20:21.784
Wow, poor guy.
What a shame.

20:21.853 --> 20:23.652
You really seem
broken up about it.

20:23.721 --> 20:26.789
Why should I be?
Allston had it coming.

20:26.858 --> 20:28.791
Well, that's what
we call a motive.

20:28.860 --> 20:30.793
And you're what
we call a suspect.

20:30.862 --> 20:32.139
I'm sorry,
am I missing something?

20:32.163 --> 20:34.763
Because the USS <i>Ewing</i> is at sea.

20:34.832 --> 20:37.867
So, what did I do, magically
teleport there and back?

20:37.935 --> 20:40.269
That's some real top-notch
investigating there, fellas.

20:40.338 --> 20:41.982
You know, I feel safer
knowing that cops like you

20:42.006 --> 20:43.706
are out there protecting us.

20:43.774 --> 20:45.975
You know, I'll bet
a charming guy such as yourself

20:46.043 --> 20:48.277
still has a few friends
on board that ship.

20:48.346 --> 20:50.846
Yeah. So what?

20:50.915 --> 20:54.049
Well, maybe you had them
dish out a little revenge.

20:54.118 --> 20:57.052
Allston reported your drug use
up the chain of command.

20:57.121 --> 20:58.765
Maybe you were looking
for a little payback.

20:58.789 --> 21:00.222
Hey, I smoked a little pot

21:00.291 --> 21:02.491
during our port visit
to Cartagena.

21:02.560 --> 21:03.659
All right?
It's Colombia.

21:03.728 --> 21:05.027
I could have done
far worse.

21:05.096 --> 21:08.163
But no, Allston just had to
make a big deal out of it.

21:08.232 --> 21:09.865
Well, he should have
kept his mouth shut.

21:09.934 --> 21:12.234
Well, killing him definitely
taught him a lesson.

21:12.303 --> 21:13.669
Get serious, man.

21:13.738 --> 21:16.538
I wasn't the only one on the
crew who couldn't stand the guy.

21:16.607 --> 21:18.073
Who else?

21:18.142 --> 21:19.675
Gee...

21:19.744 --> 21:21.911
My memory's not so good
these days.

21:21.979 --> 21:23.812
You guys want
anything else,

21:23.881 --> 21:25.581
you can call my attorney.

21:27.718 --> 21:30.753
Man, this guy makes me
miss my mentees.

21:30.821 --> 21:32.187
Townsley was trouble
from the day

21:32.256 --> 21:33.567
he stepped on board
two years ago.

21:33.591 --> 21:35.424
Did he have any
other infractions?

21:35.493 --> 21:38.727
Two nonjudicial punishments
for insubordination and assault

21:38.796 --> 21:40.796
prior to his failed
drug test.

21:40.831 --> 21:44.133
Townsley was just itching for
a bad-conduct discharge.

21:44.168 --> 21:45.935
Hold on, Townsley worked
in the same division

21:46.003 --> 21:47.403
as Petty Officer Brown?

21:47.471 --> 21:49.438
That's correct.
Deck department.

21:49.507 --> 21:52.007
Same Brown who was
Allston's bunkmate?

21:52.076 --> 21:53.820
Medical
emergency, crew berthing.

21:53.844 --> 21:55.744
Medical emergency,
crew berthing.

21:57.848 --> 21:59.726
He's not responding
to chest compressions.

21:59.750 --> 22:02.184
I'll get the respirator.
Start bagging him.

22:04.588 --> 22:06.188
Petty Officer Brown.

22:06.257 --> 22:07.189
What happened?

22:07.258 --> 22:08.524
I don't know, ma'am.

22:08.592 --> 22:10.032
He was unresponsive
when I found him.

22:19.454 --> 22:20.887
What is Brown's condition?

22:20.955 --> 22:22.889
Well, the corpsmen were able
to stabilize him,

22:22.957 --> 22:24.590
but he hasn't
regained consciousness.

22:24.659 --> 22:27.393
Doc suspects that it was
another drug overdose.

22:27.462 --> 22:29.595
Huh. Two sailors OD

22:29.664 --> 22:31.364
on the same ship,
in the same day.

22:31.432 --> 22:33.199
That doesn't sound like
a coincidence.

22:33.268 --> 22:35.134
It's a PR nightmare.

22:35.203 --> 22:36.702
SECNAV wants answers,

22:36.771 --> 22:38.104
and so do I.

22:38.172 --> 22:39.450
You find any drugs
on him, Bishop?

22:39.474 --> 22:40.740
No, nothing.

22:40.808 --> 22:43.276
I sent all the contents
from his footlocker to the lab.

22:43.344 --> 22:44.744
All right, stay close.

22:44.812 --> 22:46.245
I want to know
when he wakes up.

22:46.314 --> 22:47.880
Copy that.

22:47.949 --> 22:49.916
Leon.

22:52.220 --> 22:54.954
I know that look.

22:55.023 --> 22:56.255
What's on your mind, Jack?

22:56.324 --> 22:59.959
Something I'm curious about.

23:00.028 --> 23:02.995
Before I transferred to HQ,
who worked in my office?

23:03.064 --> 23:06.232
It had been vacant
for a few years.

23:06.301 --> 23:08.501
Uh-huh. And before that?

23:08.603 --> 23:10.970
Why do you want to know?

23:11.039 --> 23:13.973
Just a hunch...

23:14.042 --> 23:16.609
that that look in your eye
is confirming.

23:16.678 --> 23:18.844
It was Agent Girard, wasn't it?

23:18.913 --> 23:20.746
Let it go, Jack.

23:20.815 --> 23:23.616
That's not really my specialty,
as you know, Leon.

23:23.685 --> 23:27.486
Then I would suggest
that you tread lightly.

23:27.555 --> 23:28.621
- Hmm?
- Mm-hmm.

23:33.027 --> 23:36.629
They say parting is
such sweet sorrow.

23:36.698 --> 23:38.431
Not always.

23:38.499 --> 23:39.877
Bet you can't say
where that line's from.

23:39.901 --> 23:41.767
Here's a hint.
It's not <i>Maxim.</i>

23:41.836 --> 23:45.171
Oh. I'll miss those
witty remarks most of all.

23:45.239 --> 23:47.340
Agent Torres,
would it be possible

23:47.408 --> 23:49.008
to extend shadowing
another day?

23:49.077 --> 23:51.155
I just feel like there's so much
we didn't get to see yet and...

23:51.179 --> 23:53.012
Oh, I know, I know, right?

23:53.081 --> 23:55.481
I know, but those are the rules.

23:55.550 --> 23:56.716
That's all the time we got.

23:56.784 --> 23:58.651
So, yeah.

23:58.720 --> 24:00.000
Well, we really appreciate

24:00.054 --> 24:01.854
you mentoring us
for these past few days.

24:01.923 --> 24:03.489
I feel like I've learned a lot.

24:03.558 --> 24:05.191
Yeah, thanks to you,
we learned how

24:05.259 --> 24:07.660
to get by in life by doing
as little as humanly possible.

24:07.729 --> 24:10.496
It's a gift.

24:10.565 --> 24:12.398
This probie will, uh,
lead you guys out.

24:12.467 --> 24:14.967
Take care.
Thank you so much.

24:15.036 --> 24:17.570
It's been real.
Stay in school.

24:17.638 --> 24:18.871
And please remember,

24:18.940 --> 24:21.507
only you can prevent
forest fires.

24:27.782 --> 24:30.516
Back out now,
while you still can, Tim.

24:30.585 --> 24:32.018
'Cause you ain't ready
for this.

24:32.086 --> 24:34.887
Hey, I was born
ready for this.

24:34.956 --> 24:38.524
Okay? You-you are going
down. You watch.

24:38.593 --> 24:42.028
Wow, we both really need
to work on our trash talk.

24:42.096 --> 24:43.896
- I agree.
- Okay, focus.

24:43.965 --> 24:47.733
Ready, set, go.

24:49.971 --> 24:53.072
Oh, nope. Ugh!

24:53.141 --> 24:56.575
Oh, number one energy drink
in the U.S. my foot.

24:56.644 --> 24:58.711
I like it.

24:58.780 --> 25:00.246
Are you a masochist?

25:00.314 --> 25:02.081
Why would anyone
voluntarily drink this?

25:02.150 --> 25:04.617
Well, sailors live
off this stuff.

25:04.685 --> 25:07.086
Helps 'em stay awake
when they're standing watch.

25:07.155 --> 25:10.022
Oh... I should get
hazard pay. Ugh.

25:10.091 --> 25:12.391
Then why are you
drinking it?

25:12.460 --> 25:14.360
Oh, research. The case
of Day/Night Energy

25:14.429 --> 25:16.262
that was confiscated
from Brown's footlocker

25:16.330 --> 25:19.065
was laced with Tri-Shots.

25:19.133 --> 25:20.800
- Every bottle?
- Yep.

25:20.868 --> 25:22.802
And if energy drinks
are as popular on ships

25:22.870 --> 25:23.936
as you say they are,

25:24.005 --> 25:26.005
I mean, that makes it
the perfect place

25:26.074 --> 25:27.074
to hide contraband.

25:27.141 --> 25:28.707
So, why would Brown
be dumb enough

25:28.776 --> 25:30.409
to overdose on his own supply?

25:30.478 --> 25:33.813
He brought drugs
onto a Navy ship.

25:33.881 --> 25:35.526
I mean, he's already proven
that he's lacking

25:35.550 --> 25:36.627
in the intelligence department.

25:36.651 --> 25:39.919
Unless... he drank it
not knowing

25:39.987 --> 25:41.320
it was laced with Tri-Shots.

25:41.389 --> 25:44.590
If the same thing happened
to Petty Officer Allston,

25:44.659 --> 25:46.559
then that means
they're both victims.

25:46.627 --> 25:48.094
Hmm.

25:49.730 --> 25:51.430
Come on, man.

25:52.567 --> 25:54.366
Petty Officer Brown's background

25:54.435 --> 25:55.501
is clean, Gibbs.

25:55.570 --> 25:58.070
No past drug history.
Same as Allston's.

25:58.139 --> 25:59.805
Somebody brought the drugs
on board.

25:59.874 --> 26:00.973
Where'd they come from?

26:01.042 --> 26:04.176
Well, DEA's records show
that the Tri-Shots

26:04.245 --> 26:06.912
came on the scene
about four months ago,

26:06.981 --> 26:09.348
with instances concentrated
along the Eastern seaboard.

26:09.417 --> 26:11.317
They smuggled in
from South America?

26:11.385 --> 26:12.585
Zero reports of the drug

26:12.653 --> 26:14.286
have been found
in any of the countries

26:14.355 --> 26:16.922
the USS <i>Ewing</i>
has visited in port.

26:16.991 --> 26:18.924
As of now,
it's not international.

26:18.993 --> 26:21.026
It's got to be homegrown.

26:21.095 --> 26:22.261
McGee.

26:22.330 --> 26:23.629
Torres.

26:23.698 --> 26:25.331
Check into every
person of interest

26:25.399 --> 26:27.099
the DEA looked into
for Tri-Shots.

26:27.168 --> 26:28.467
On it.

26:28.536 --> 26:30.369
Wait, what?

26:30.438 --> 26:31.971
Oh, come on.

26:32.039 --> 26:33.506
I got it.

26:33.574 --> 26:37.343
Security says Max never
exited the building.

26:37.411 --> 26:39.645
So, what are you doing here?

26:39.714 --> 26:41.714
You said you got it. Go.

26:59.634 --> 27:01.367
Thought I'd help you out.

27:01.435 --> 27:04.737
I don't need your help.
Go away.

27:04.805 --> 27:06.805
Ah, I can't.

27:06.874 --> 27:10.042
Building security is
looking everywhere for you.

27:10.111 --> 27:12.378
Which means you are
running out of time.

27:12.446 --> 27:16.348
So, go on in.

27:16.417 --> 27:18.484
This is why you
came here, right?

27:21.055 --> 27:23.088
I-I was just, um...

27:23.157 --> 27:25.824
You were just thinking
about the last time

27:25.893 --> 27:29.094
you stood on this spot,
looking through these doors?

27:30.898 --> 27:32.531
Director Vance told you?

27:32.567 --> 27:35.668
I figured it out
on my own.

27:37.972 --> 27:39.772
Let me guess.

27:39.840 --> 27:43.542
You're gonna tell me
that you understand,

27:43.611 --> 27:46.679
that you get me?

27:46.747 --> 27:48.447
I don't want to hear it.

27:48.516 --> 27:53.052
Okay. Then how about
I just tell you the truth?

27:53.120 --> 27:55.721
And what's that, Dr. Phil?

27:55.790 --> 27:59.725
You want to believe that you've
moved on from what happened,

27:59.794 --> 28:01.794
but you're only
lying to yourself.

28:01.862 --> 28:04.730
You won't get closure
unless you let go

28:04.799 --> 28:07.299
of the anger you're
holding onto.

28:11.505 --> 28:15.541
I swore I'd never set foot
in this building again.

28:15.610 --> 28:18.410
Yeah. Then why did you?

28:20.514 --> 28:22.548
Something I had to do.

28:22.617 --> 28:25.751
- Mm.
- Not just for me.

28:30.157 --> 28:32.491
Seeing this place again...

28:32.560 --> 28:35.494
it's like nothing's changed.

28:38.566 --> 28:41.567
Yet, everything has changed.

28:44.171 --> 28:45.504
Coming here was a mistake.

28:45.573 --> 28:47.473
No.

28:47.541 --> 28:49.308
- Hey...
- Unbelievable.

28:49.377 --> 28:50.309
No, wait, Nick.

28:50.378 --> 28:51.510
Unbelievable.

28:51.579 --> 28:53.178
You were supposed
to leave hours ago.

28:53.247 --> 28:54.780
This isn't a day care,
kid. Move it.

28:54.849 --> 28:57.650
- Come on.
- No.

28:57.718 --> 28:59.351
What?

28:59.420 --> 29:02.154
I'm not leaving.

29:02.223 --> 29:03.789
Hey, Torres...

29:03.858 --> 29:05.202
You've been nothing but
a pain in the ass

29:05.226 --> 29:06.792
in the past two days.

29:06.861 --> 29:08.501
You don't listen,
you don't follow orders,

29:08.529 --> 29:09.662
and you show no respect.

29:09.730 --> 29:11.196
A lecture on respect

29:11.265 --> 29:12.798
is the last thing
I need from you.

29:12.867 --> 29:14.077
Well, getting stuck with
a privileged,

29:14.101 --> 29:15.501
ungrateful punk like you

29:15.569 --> 29:17.102
isn't what I need, either.
- Hey, Nick.

29:17.171 --> 29:19.872
Grateful. What should I
be grateful for?

29:19.940 --> 29:22.775
How you acted like mentoring
was beneath you?

29:22.843 --> 29:24.421
How you treated us
like we were a burden?

29:24.445 --> 29:25.811
How...

29:29.583 --> 29:34.053
I know what an agent is.

29:34.121 --> 29:35.688
You're not it.

29:35.756 --> 29:37.523
And what would
you know about it?

29:37.591 --> 29:42.161
A real agent goes the extra mile
to help people.

29:42.229 --> 29:45.864
He puts his life on the line
every day, and makes sacrifices,

29:45.933 --> 29:48.901
which is something you are far
too self-absorbed to comprehend.

29:51.772 --> 29:53.739
Max...

29:56.811 --> 29:57.910
You believe that kid?

29:57.978 --> 30:02.548
Uh, actually, Nick,

30:02.616 --> 30:05.084
I'd say you're the one
acting like a child here.

30:05.152 --> 30:07.653
Me? What did I do?

30:07.722 --> 30:09.488
How about what you <i>didn't</i> do?

30:09.557 --> 30:11.890
Like read your mentees' essays.

30:11.926 --> 30:14.927
Jack, I was busy
working on the case.

30:14.995 --> 30:17.029
Had you tried to
get to know them,

30:17.098 --> 30:20.933
you would know that Max
is the son of Ed Girard,

30:21.001 --> 30:23.001
one of the NCIS agents
that was killed

30:23.070 --> 30:25.671
in the Navy Yard bombing
six years ago.

30:25.740 --> 30:30.576
Max was here visiting
his father that day.

30:30.644 --> 30:33.579
Only one of them
made it out alive.

30:33.647 --> 30:37.449
He came here
searching for closure,

30:37.518 --> 30:40.119
and he was treated
like an inconvenience.

30:40.187 --> 30:43.622
You want me
to choose sides, Nick?

30:43.691 --> 30:45.624
I'm on Max's.

30:57.310 --> 30:59.043
The ship's on alert,
and all bottles

30:59.112 --> 31:01.370
of Day/Night Energy on board
have been confiscated

31:01.371 --> 31:02.371
just in case.

31:02.406 --> 31:04.139
The crew give you anything?

31:04.208 --> 31:07.008
Not much. Barely any of them
have heard of Tri-Shots,

31:07.077 --> 31:08.443
or so they say.

31:08.512 --> 31:09.844
There any change in Brown?

31:09.913 --> 31:12.614
Well, he regained consciousness
a half hour ago.

31:12.683 --> 31:14.015
I'm standing by to question him.

31:14.084 --> 31:15.483
All right, keep me posted,
Bishop.

31:15.552 --> 31:18.687
Hey, Gibbs?

31:18.755 --> 31:20.355
Why didn't you tell me?

31:20.424 --> 31:21.556
Tell you what?

31:21.625 --> 31:24.626
That Max was Agent Girard's son.

31:25.929 --> 31:27.462
Why would I?

31:28.632 --> 31:30.243
Well, because I would've
acted differently.

31:30.267 --> 31:32.534
I would've...
would've done something else.

31:32.603 --> 31:35.537
It shouldn't matter who he was.

31:35.606 --> 31:37.706
That's the point, Torres.

31:38.809 --> 31:41.142
Was this some kind of test?

31:41.211 --> 31:43.979
You're damn right.

31:44.047 --> 31:46.848
What do you want from me?

31:48.452 --> 31:51.019
This is your mess, Nick.
You clean it up.

31:51.088 --> 31:52.754
Hey, I didn't ask for this.

31:54.925 --> 31:56.591
I wasn't cut out
to be a teacher.

31:56.660 --> 31:58.560
You are scared.

31:59.663 --> 32:01.763
I don't get scared.

32:03.900 --> 32:08.837
Stop holding back...

32:08.905 --> 32:11.706
when something is not familiar.

32:11.775 --> 32:14.109
Because you know
everything, right?

32:16.246 --> 32:19.547
A student's failure

32:19.616 --> 32:22.784
is a reflection
of their teacher.

32:39.536 --> 32:42.470
Don't bother apologizing.
I don't need your pity.

32:42.539 --> 32:45.040
Oh, I wasn't gonna apologize.

32:45.108 --> 32:47.609
You do owe me one, though.

32:47.678 --> 32:50.245
Good luck with that.

32:50.314 --> 32:54.316
Are you always this irritating,
or is it just with me?

32:54.384 --> 32:56.785
You're not that special.

32:56.853 --> 33:00.388
All right,
so you don't want an apology.

33:00.457 --> 33:02.390
Then what
do you want?

33:02.459 --> 33:05.794
I used to think that NCIS was

33:05.862 --> 33:08.830
the coolest place ever,
when I was a kid.

33:08.899 --> 33:13.234
I'd come here all the time
to visit my dad at work.

33:26.049 --> 33:28.583
What was he like?

33:28.652 --> 33:31.619
He...

33:31.688 --> 33:36.024
loved helping people.

33:36.093 --> 33:38.793
He always used to say,

33:38.862 --> 33:44.199
"Son, in a world full of
problems, be the solution."

33:46.336 --> 33:50.672
And I guess every son feels
that way about their dad.

33:54.711 --> 33:57.846
Were you in the
building that day?

34:02.352 --> 34:04.052
No.

34:04.121 --> 34:05.987
I was.

34:10.594 --> 34:13.795
The sounds...

34:17.134 --> 34:18.867
...the smells...

34:23.607 --> 34:28.143
No matter how hard I
try and forget that day,

34:28.210 --> 34:30.145
I can't.

34:30.213 --> 34:34.215
Agent Sloane was right.

34:34.284 --> 34:38.386
I am angry.

34:38.455 --> 34:41.822
Why did I get to live
and my dad had to die?

34:43.927 --> 34:45.693
It's been six years

34:45.762 --> 34:50.264
and I still don't understand
why this happened.

34:50.333 --> 34:54.768
That's a question you're never
gonna get an answer to.

34:54.838 --> 34:58.773
I've been waiting 30 years
for one.

34:58.842 --> 35:01.576
That's the last time
I saw my father.

35:01.645 --> 35:03.211
He, uh,

35:03.280 --> 35:06.214
he ran out on my mom, my sister
and me when I was five.

35:06.283 --> 35:09.184
You know,
when you're abandoned, you...

35:09.252 --> 35:12.120
you're left wondering why.

35:12.189 --> 35:14.255
And no answer will ever fix it.

35:16.326 --> 35:18.566
You know, we don't get to choose
what-what happens to us,

35:18.595 --> 35:22.530
but we get to choose
how it shapes us.

35:22.599 --> 35:25.266
Don't, don't let
what happened that day, uh,

35:25.335 --> 35:30.605
overshadow the memories...
memories of your father.

35:35.345 --> 35:37.078
I just miss him.

35:37.147 --> 35:39.481
I know.

35:39.549 --> 35:42.116
But he would want you
to live your life.

35:45.121 --> 35:47.255
You trust me on that?

35:51.828 --> 35:53.761
I'm sorry about earlier.

35:56.032 --> 35:57.966
Me, too.

36:08.178 --> 36:10.178
Hey.

36:10.247 --> 36:11.846
Do you know where you are?

36:13.183 --> 36:17.285
Medical, but I don't know how.

36:17.354 --> 36:19.654
What's the last thing
you remember?

36:19.723 --> 36:21.155
Oh, I wasn't feeling too well,

36:21.224 --> 36:22.690
so I went and laid down
on my rack.

36:22.759 --> 36:26.327
But must have just been
something I ate.

36:26.396 --> 36:28.963
Close. Something you drank.

36:28.999 --> 36:30.932
Energy drinks in your locker

36:31.001 --> 36:33.001
were laced with drugs.

36:33.069 --> 36:34.969
You are lucky
to be alive.

36:36.273 --> 36:39.440
I... I had no idea.

36:42.078 --> 36:43.811
Allston.

36:45.115 --> 36:46.881
That's what killed him?

36:46.950 --> 36:48.883
How do you know that?

36:48.952 --> 36:51.686
He got sent those drinks
in a care package,

36:51.755 --> 36:53.321
and he drank one.

36:53.390 --> 36:55.023
But he hated it.

36:55.091 --> 36:56.824
He said he
was gonna toss it,

36:56.893 --> 36:58.793
but I said
I'd take them instead.

36:58.862 --> 37:02.230
Did he say who sent
the care package?

37:07.771 --> 37:10.338
It was an accident.

37:10.407 --> 37:14.642
You sent your brother
a care package laced with drugs.

37:15.912 --> 37:20.048
It was never meant
to go to him.

37:20.116 --> 37:24.652
I... I accidentally
mixed up the shipments.

37:24.721 --> 37:27.155
The package was meant
for your dealer.

37:27.223 --> 37:29.591
By the time that I'd realized

37:29.659 --> 37:35.029
what I'd done...
it was too late.

37:35.098 --> 37:37.765
You are a Tri-Shot distributor.

37:39.102 --> 37:40.668
One of them.

37:40.737 --> 37:42.437
Did your brother know?

37:42.505 --> 37:44.839
No.

37:44.908 --> 37:49.277
I could never bring myself
to tell him the truth.

37:49.346 --> 37:52.714
I knew how disappointed
he'd be in me.

37:52.782 --> 37:56.250
I loved my brother
more than anything.

37:56.319 --> 37:59.287
I'll never be able to forgive
myself for what I've done.

38:02.459 --> 38:07.462
I want the names of everyone
in your operation.

38:25.348 --> 38:27.315
Good morning.

38:27.384 --> 38:28.716
Hey, welcome back.

38:28.785 --> 38:30.718
How's Petty Officer Brown?

38:30.787 --> 38:32.420
Making a speedy recovery.

38:32.489 --> 38:34.649
Doc said he'll be back to
full duty in just a few days.

38:35.725 --> 38:36.991
Hey.

38:37.060 --> 38:38.626
Would you look at that?

38:38.695 --> 38:39.827
Got your sea legs.

38:39.896 --> 38:41.663
Yeah. And then some.

38:41.731 --> 38:43.665
As a thanks for our
help, Commander Rackham

38:43.733 --> 38:45.299
made me an honorary Shellback.

38:45.368 --> 38:47.935
I've been angling
for one of these for years.

38:48.004 --> 38:49.170
You get all the luck.

38:49.239 --> 38:51.239
Hey, where's Torres?

38:51.307 --> 38:53.441
He took a personal day.

38:53.510 --> 38:55.243
- Yeah. Gibbs.
- Personal day?

38:55.311 --> 38:56.671
I didn't think
we could take those.

38:56.713 --> 38:58.079
Me, neither.

38:58.148 --> 39:00.114
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

39:00.150 --> 39:01.716
Grab your gear.

39:01.751 --> 39:03.384
Got a robbery in Quantico.

39:03.420 --> 39:06.454
Mm. Well,
guess there's always tomorrow.

39:06.523 --> 39:08.823
An agent's job
is never done.

39:13.863 --> 39:16.264
All right. Well, that,
ladies and gentlemen,

39:16.332 --> 39:18.599
concludes your first-class tour

39:18.668 --> 39:21.869
of a U.S. Navy
guided missile cruiser.

39:21.938 --> 39:24.539
Ha! You know,
it's bigger than it looks.

39:24.607 --> 39:26.207
A cafeteria, gym
and a barber shop?

39:26.276 --> 39:28.976
It's like a small
floating city.

39:29.045 --> 39:30.978
You know, I still can't believe
we got access

39:31.047 --> 39:32.447
into the Combat
Information Center.

39:32.515 --> 39:33.848
Didn't we need to have

39:33.917 --> 39:35.616
a secret security
clearance for that?

39:35.685 --> 39:38.619
Yeah, so I, uh,
called in a favor for that.

39:38.688 --> 39:41.389
Let that be, uh,
our little secret.

39:41.458 --> 39:42.490
Okay.

39:42.559 --> 39:43.791
Right.

39:43.860 --> 39:45.793
Hey, uh, what made you
change your mind

39:45.862 --> 39:47.995
letting us shadow you for
another day, Agent Torres?

39:50.934 --> 39:53.067
Well, I realized
that I should've given you

39:53.136 --> 39:54.902
a proper NCIS education

39:54.971 --> 39:57.672
instead of tricking you
into running my errands.

39:58.875 --> 40:00.575
Tricking us?

40:00.643 --> 40:02.043
I told you his expense reports

40:02.112 --> 40:03.711
weren't a matter
of national security.

40:03.780 --> 40:06.147
I didn't think you'd
believe me.

40:06.216 --> 40:08.583
But still, it-it was wrong.

40:08.651 --> 40:11.552
And, uh, I just...

40:11.621 --> 40:13.554
I hope this day
out in the field,

40:13.623 --> 40:15.890
uh, somehow made up for it.

40:15.959 --> 40:18.025
Uh, and not to mention
this super legit

40:18.094 --> 40:19.994
NCIS swag,
courtesy of

40:20.063 --> 40:21.763
this guy.

40:21.831 --> 40:23.397
These <i>are</i> pretty nice.

40:23.466 --> 40:25.666
I guess so.

40:25.735 --> 40:27.869
Look at that.
We're off the clock.

40:27.937 --> 40:29.871
Just like that.
You know what that means?

40:29.939 --> 40:32.273
- Happy hour at a bar? Huh?
- No.

40:32.342 --> 40:33.941
No.

40:34.010 --> 40:36.110
Diner and burgers, on me.

40:36.179 --> 40:38.045
I'm in. Shotgun.

40:38.114 --> 40:39.394
You had shotgun on the way here.

40:41.951 --> 40:43.217
Hey, Blake!

40:43.286 --> 40:45.787
Hey, hey, all right.
I call music!

40:45.855 --> 40:47.099
How long do you think
we should wait until

40:47.123 --> 40:48.300
we tell them
it's walking distance?

40:48.324 --> 40:50.525
I say we call them
from the diner.

40:50.593 --> 40:52.527
Okay.

40:52.595 --> 40:54.262
Yeah, that's good.

40:58.001 --> 40:59.934
Hey, you look
pretty good in that.

41:02.672 --> 41:04.605
Something to consider.

41:05.942 --> 41:09.310
I'm not so sure about that.

41:09.379 --> 41:11.145
I'm not my father.

41:11.214 --> 41:14.916
Hey, don't sell
yourself short, kid.

41:14.984 --> 41:16.918
Not on my watch.

41:20.123 --> 41:23.925
Besides, a wise man once said,

41:23.993 --> 41:29.964
"In a world full of problems,
be the solution."

41:30.033 --> 41:31.899
You heard that somewhere?

41:31.968 --> 41:34.135
Yeah, it kind of stuck with me
a little bit.

41:34.204 --> 41:36.904
Come on, probie.
I'm starving.
