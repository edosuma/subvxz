WEBVTT

01:11.000 --> 01:12.033
Who is she?

01:12.400 --> 01:16.000
The mama-san, she runs
things here with an iron fist.

01:16.700 --> 01:17.700
Hmm.

01:18.200 --> 01:19.300
So she's the GateKeeper.

01:20.800 --> 01:23.233
Controls all the opium
and the women in this club

01:23.433 --> 01:26.233
Exactly, if you want to have good time

01:26.433 --> 01:29.100
best to follow all her rules.

01:29.500 --> 01:30.500
Yes.

01:31.300 --> 01:33.967
I do want a good time.

01:41.867 --> 01:42.867
Oh...

01:42.967 --> 01:44.533
This smoke chokes you up.

01:44.900 --> 01:47.300
Take it easy, you
need to draw it in slowly.

01:47.500 --> 01:49.133
I'm not a patient man.

01:49.300 --> 01:49.991
Hey!

01:50.033 --> 01:51.633
I got a better idea.

01:52.600 --> 01:54.224
Gentlemen! No!

01:54.266 --> 01:57.558
Come on darling, we just
want a little taste of you.

01:57.600 --> 01:58.900
Please stop!

01:59.200 --> 02:00.834
Come on, girl, just give us some love.

02:01.467 --> 02:03.959
Are you here to smoke? Oh cause trouble?

02:04.001 --> 02:06.233
Oh, she's a feisty one.

02:07.400 --> 02:09.500
Do you always fight during lovemaking?

02:11.233 --> 02:13.458
Damn, she's a hot little bitch!

02:13.500 --> 02:15.100
What's going on here?

02:15.900 --> 02:16.658
It's fine.

02:16.700 --> 02:19.291
Just a little passionate fun is all.

02:19.333 --> 02:21.900
It's not, they are misbehaving.

02:22.400 --> 02:24.767
Gentlemen, we have rules.

02:25.200 --> 02:27.491
We pay you a lot of
money to have fun evening.

02:27.533 --> 02:29.224
Huh? A lot of money.

02:29.266 --> 02:31.567
Do you want to give us a refund?

02:31.900 --> 02:35.166
Let me find you another girl this evening.

02:35.300 --> 02:38.467
We have many pretty ones.
I'm sure you'll find one you like.

02:38.633 --> 02:40.867
No, no, no... We want this one.

02:41.200 --> 02:43.967
And we don't mind a
little rough horse play.

02:44.667 --> 02:47.934
I heard some commotion,
is someone having a party here?

02:51.500 --> 02:52.734
All be...

02:53.600 --> 02:56.700
You're the two blokes that
run the Ice House Factory?

02:57.266 --> 02:59.224
Oh Mr. Chow! Oh, Mr. Chow!

02:59.266 --> 03:01.633
It's so wonderful to see you here.

03:02.600 --> 03:06.266
These two gentlemen I
do big business with them.

03:06.700 --> 03:07.700
Everyone

03:08.100 --> 03:11.767
Everyone, needs ice in the tropics.

03:12.233 --> 03:13.258
Business partners?

03:13.300 --> 03:14.333
No, no...

03:14.400 --> 03:17.734
Mr. Chow is our most important customer.

03:17.900 --> 03:19.066
Yes, indeed.

03:19.233 --> 03:22.467
I spend a small fortune at your factory.

03:24.700 --> 03:25.900
Mama-san

03:26.300 --> 03:28.867
I think I would like to smoke my opium.

03:29.200 --> 03:31.600
With this young lady this evening.

03:32.100 --> 03:33.500
Could that be arranged?

03:35.400 --> 03:38.658
Oh, actually we were just about to leave.

03:38.700 --> 03:41.625
We are meeting some
friends at another club.

03:41.667 --> 03:42.900
Yes. Yes.

03:43.100 --> 03:46.266
Brilliant! Perfect timing
on my part I guess.

03:46.333 --> 03:48.233
Yes, perfect timing.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.367
Did you really want her services?

03:55.734 --> 03:57.400
What might your name be?

03:58.100 --> 03:59.600
Siu Fong

04:00.400 --> 04:01.533
Siu Fong

04:01.700 --> 04:05.367
Are you skilled into art
of rolling a bowl of opium?

04:05.700 --> 04:06.800
And not burning it?

04:07.200 --> 04:07.800
Yes.

04:08.033 --> 04:09.834
I am very skilled.

04:10.467 --> 04:11.467
Ok

04:11.500 --> 04:15.100
Siu Fong can roll my opium this evening.

04:15.500 --> 04:19.100
Great, Mr. Chow. I will have a
servant bring in the same batch.

04:19.633 --> 04:21.066
The same amount like last time?

04:21.400 --> 04:22.467
Definitely,

04:22.700 --> 04:24.734
same amount as always.

04:24.900 --> 04:26.633
Will do Mr. Chow. Will do.

04:30.500 --> 04:31.667
Thank you for that.

04:35.100 --> 04:37.033
Young men with money,

04:37.600 --> 04:39.133
have no discipline.

04:39.500 --> 04:42.333
Very bad manners at all.

04:58.200 --> 04:59.843
Is this your first time
inside the Battlebox?

04:59.867 --> 05:01.100
Yes, first time.

05:01.166 --> 05:05.001
You may be a bit disappointed by the decor,
but I assure you we're rather safe here.

05:05.500 --> 05:08.567
We're about 60 feet below
ground, under Victoria Barracks.

05:08.934 --> 05:11.767
This is the command center for
all British forces in Hong Kong.

05:12.300 --> 05:13.734
It really is the nerve center.

05:14.100 --> 05:16.800
Communications, signals, telegraph,

05:16.867 --> 05:19.066
and telephone exchange all located inside.

05:19.567 --> 05:22.858
Your post will be the telephone switchboard.
I assume you know how to operate one?

05:22.900 --> 05:25.467
Yes, I worked the telephone
switchboard at the Royal Hotel.

05:25.633 --> 05:26.900
Very good, an expert.

05:27.200 --> 05:29.100
Let me show you your post.

05:33.900 --> 05:36.309
You do need a good set of ears
to filter out the background noise.

05:36.333 --> 05:37.224
I will be fine, sir.

05:37.266 --> 05:38.333
That's the spirit.

05:38.600 --> 05:40.858
Ah, you must be the new girl.

05:40.900 --> 05:41.825
What do they call you?

05:41.867 --> 05:42.867
Yu Mei Fong

05:42.967 --> 05:45.967
Ah, welcome aboard, George Armstrong.

05:46.200 --> 05:48.280
I was just giving Mei Fong
a run down of this place.

05:48.367 --> 05:49.633
Oh were you.

05:49.800 --> 05:51.358
Well, don't listen to this chap.

05:51.400 --> 05:54.100
He may have the fancy
title of British spy chief,

05:54.600 --> 05:58.240
but between you and me these intelligence boys
really don't have very much in the way of...

05:58.700 --> 06:00.767
Well, common sense.

06:01.900 --> 06:04.800
Be careful what you
hear down here Mei Fong.

06:05.333 --> 06:06.800
It can be dangerous place.

06:06.967 --> 06:08.400
Don't mind George.

06:08.567 --> 06:09.925
He is all fire and brimstone.

06:09.967 --> 06:12.400
Everything's solvable
with a burst of artillery.

06:13.333 --> 06:14.258
Don't worry Charles.

06:14.300 --> 06:16.233
She will soon know all our little secrets.

06:16.400 --> 06:18.625
Switchies know everything
that happens in the Battlebox.

06:18.667 --> 06:20.224
Who is talking to who,

06:20.266 --> 06:21.991
late night escapades, that sort of thing.

06:22.033 --> 06:23.491
Let's leave this poor girl alone.

06:23.533 --> 06:25.242
We don't want to scare
her on her first day.

06:25.266 --> 06:26.967
Not on her first day, no.

06:27.133 --> 06:30.300
I do have something I want to
discuss with you though, Charles.

06:31.266 --> 06:32.158
Any questions?

06:32.200 --> 06:32.900
No sir.

06:33.033 --> 06:36.100
Happy listening, your first call.

06:36.900 --> 06:38.467
This is Mr. Chow.

06:39.200 --> 06:41.600
Reports are coming in that
he's working for the other side.

06:41.767 --> 06:43.934
A fifth-columnist. I
thought you should know.

06:44.100 --> 06:44.958
I will look into it.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.367
See that you do, Charles.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.633
Honestly, we have a bit
of a crisis on our hands.

06:52.200 --> 06:59.200
The Japanese have been surprisingly effective at infiltrating
a vast network of potential fifth-columnists in Hong Kong.

07:00.200 --> 07:03.667
They've even got some of the
bloody Triads on side, Charles.

07:05.066 --> 07:07.533
There's no gentle way to put this.

07:07.900 --> 07:11.400
Your intelligence
operations are falling short.

07:11.700 --> 07:14.734
You need to push back
hard on these bastards.

07:14.934 --> 07:16.576
Shoot them in the
alleyways if you have too.

07:16.600 --> 07:19.100
Outright executions!?

07:20.600 --> 07:23.133
The problem with you scholar-warrior types,

07:23.734 --> 07:25.266
You never learn to pull the trigger.

07:25.633 --> 07:28.425
Provide me a written order
authorizing such action,

07:28.467 --> 07:30.533
then I will consider it.

07:32.200 --> 07:35.200
Just get it done, Charles!

07:37.100 --> 07:38.900
He really is a loose cannon.

07:39.700 --> 07:42.467
You get all types here in the Battlebox.

07:52.900 --> 07:55.233
Alright men make sure
your weapons are clean.

07:55.400 --> 07:57.967
A jammed rifle could
cost you your damn life.

07:58.133 --> 08:01.567
As a Rajput soldier in the Indian army,
we must up hold the highest of standards.

08:01.900 --> 08:04.900
And today, we will scout out the
Northeast sector of the Gin Drinkers Line.

08:05.033 --> 08:06.513
Recently there have been some reports

08:06.567 --> 08:09.000
of some Japanese agents
operating in the area.

08:09.333 --> 08:11.834
So make sure you're ready.
Let's go have a look-see.

08:12.266 --> 08:13.266
Get going.

08:14.300 --> 08:16.367
He's been so hard on us lately,

08:16.800 --> 08:18.433
A bit paranoid I would say.

08:18.600 --> 08:19.600
Yeah right.

08:19.633 --> 08:22.934
We waste so much time
on these stupid patrols.

08:23.700 --> 08:25.200
It's the same old story.

08:25.500 --> 08:27.767
We haven't had a day
off and over three weeks.

08:28.066 --> 08:31.658
I hope that the Japanese attack us by now
so that we might have some action.

08:31.700 --> 08:33.242
Is there anything you would
like to share with us Sepoy?

08:33.266 --> 08:34.266
No, sir.

08:34.333 --> 08:36.266
Alright then, let's go.

08:45.300 --> 08:46.433
Alright, follow me.

09:45.500 --> 09:47.300
What has been disturbing you, Hari?

09:48.166 --> 09:51.367
Its been a long time sir, away from India.

09:51.700 --> 09:55.400
Four years out here marching
up and down these hills.

09:55.900 --> 09:58.667
I think I'm looking forward
to going back to Lucknow.

09:59.033 --> 10:01.066
You still have four more months, my friend.

10:01.734 --> 10:03.191
You are still on duty,

10:03.233 --> 10:05.758
and it's not over until you're
on that ship heading back home.

10:05.800 --> 10:07.867
Yes, sir. Understood sir.

10:08.200 --> 10:11.166
I am trying, I'm doing my best.

10:14.033 --> 10:17.300
My father often used to
repeat an old Buddhist saying.

10:17.800 --> 10:23.033
Learn this from water, loud splashes
the river, but the ocean depths are calm.

10:23.300 --> 10:25.266
I am looking for that calm, sir.

10:25.600 --> 10:27.925
This is the Army, not a Buddhist retreat.

10:27.967 --> 10:30.491
What is this Buddhist
stuff you are believing in?

10:30.533 --> 10:32.934
The same stuff that Japanese believe in.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.133
Be like more of rest of us, you know?

10:36.600 --> 10:37.834
I am like you guys.

10:38.600 --> 10:39.967
Just a little different.

10:40.900 --> 10:43.425
How the hell did I end up with
a Buddhist monk in my platoon?

10:43.467 --> 10:45.200
You better shape up.

11:02.934 --> 11:04.792
And now the latest news from Washington.

11:04.834 --> 11:11.024
Reports are coming that the Japanese have launched a surprise
attack on Manila, Singapore and the British Colony of Hong Kong.

11:11.066 --> 11:13.224
They said that these attacks
is unknown at the moment,

11:13.266 --> 11:17.024
but stay tuned as more updates will be
arriving from our journalists in the Pacific.

11:17.066 --> 11:19.500
On the European battlefront,
a German submarine...

11:22.200 --> 11:27.166
General Maltby, early this morning the Japanese launched a
surprise attack on the American Naval Base on Pearl Harbor.

11:27.467 --> 11:32.233
Also this morning, the Japanese bombed our
Kai Tak Airfield inflicting major damage.

11:32.433 --> 11:34.692
In addition. We are
receiving numerous reports

11:34.734 --> 11:37.467
of Japanese infantry crossing
the border into Hong Kong.

11:37.800 --> 11:40.633
Well, we're at War,
there's no doubt about it.

11:40.800 --> 11:42.858
Have we had any reports
from the New Territories?

11:42.900 --> 11:46.625
We have, sir. There are reports of Japanese
troops heading south towards Tai Po.

11:46.667 --> 11:49.667
They have light tanks, armored cars
and dozens of mobile artillery pieces.

11:50.033 --> 11:54.191
Alright, alright, alert the troops stationed
on the Eastern side of the Gin Drinkers Line.

11:54.233 --> 11:55.543
We'll have to send more reinforcements.

11:55.567 --> 11:56.191
Yes sir.

11:56.233 --> 11:59.800
It's the Royal Scots holding the line directly
in front of the Japanese advance, sir.

11:59.967 --> 12:04.700
With the Rajputs at their side along with the contingent
of Punjabi's holding the line near the Shing Mun Redoubt.

12:05.100 --> 12:09.867
Mmm, this frontal assault on the Kowloon
Peninsula is probably just a diversion.

12:10.033 --> 12:13.800
My guess is the main Japanese attack
will still take place from the sea,

12:13.967 --> 12:18.500
probably by amphibious units hitting the
beaches of Repulse Bay and Deepwater Bay.

12:18.667 --> 12:20.867
Have there been any
sightings of the Japanese Fleet?

12:21.066 --> 12:24.376
The bombing this morning at Kai Tak Airfield
disabled or destroyed all of our aircraft.

12:24.400 --> 12:25.934
So we have no eyes in the sky.

12:26.100 --> 12:29.100
What we really need is a couple
of battleships stationed here,

12:29.433 --> 12:32.767
otherwise they will blockade
the harbor and starve us to death.

12:33.100 --> 12:36.100
Get an urgent cable out to Singapore
requesting help from the Royal Navy.

12:36.600 --> 12:37.191
Yes, sir.

12:37.233 --> 12:40.867
We must maintain our ability
to resupply from the sea.

12:53.700 --> 12:57.300
Mrs. Ho, I hope you
haven't been waiting for long?

12:57.467 --> 12:58.500
No, not at all.

12:58.667 --> 13:01.467
I had to visit a village anyway
for picking up some supplies,

13:01.633 --> 13:04.533
and plus had to pay you back for the cow.

13:05.533 --> 13:06.892
12 silver dollars?

13:06.934 --> 13:08.667
Yes, that was our agreed price.

13:09.200 --> 13:10.200
Thank you.

13:10.400 --> 13:11.625
How's your new job going?

13:11.667 --> 13:12.667
Well...

13:12.734 --> 13:15.333
hmm, though, there's not
much I can say about it.

13:15.533 --> 13:17.133
Sworn to secrecy so to speak.

13:17.333 --> 13:19.867
Well, at least raid their pantry.

13:20.033 --> 13:21.033
Keep your stomach full.

13:21.200 --> 13:23.400
That British food is really fattening.

13:23.767 --> 13:26.734
Nothing wrong with a
little meat on your bones.

13:26.900 --> 13:28.000
Mrs. Ho,

13:28.166 --> 13:30.900
you are now married, I still
have to find my husband!

13:31.066 --> 13:32.900
Come, let's have some tea.

13:41.567 --> 13:42.600
Mama-san

13:42.767 --> 13:45.900
Why has the price jumped up by 20 percent?

13:46.500 --> 13:48.433
If Japanese win the fight,

13:48.600 --> 13:50.867
they will just shut you down.

13:51.233 --> 13:54.258
Mr. Chang, I am not so
sure the place will be closed.

13:54.300 --> 13:56.467
Everybody likes to have a good time.

13:57.100 --> 13:58.567
I just saying.

13:59.300 --> 14:01.000
20% increase,

14:01.500 --> 14:04.333
not fair to long-time customer.

14:05.033 --> 14:08.600
Take it or leave it, that's our price.

14:12.100 --> 14:15.834
I have not heard much about
you. Where were you born?

14:16.400 --> 14:17.400
Hmmm

14:17.600 --> 14:19.767
You're not fully Chinese, are you?

14:20.100 --> 14:21.700
I had a British father.

14:23.367 --> 14:25.133
So you are Eurasian?

14:25.367 --> 14:26.367
Yes

14:27.400 --> 14:28.400
Well then,

14:28.600 --> 14:31.591
you might like my gift
that I prepare for you.

14:31.633 --> 14:35.558
It's all the rage in Paris and New York.

14:35.600 --> 14:38.266
Stockings! Silk stockings!

14:38.433 --> 14:39.433
Yes indeed.

14:39.800 --> 14:41.991
These are impossible to find.

14:42.033 --> 14:43.900
Where did you get them?

14:45.500 --> 14:47.467
That's my little secret.

14:56.100 --> 14:57.958
These are so lovely.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.767
And tempting too.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.900
You are a little devil, caught you peeking.

15:05.467 --> 15:07.166
It's in my nature.

15:08.400 --> 15:09.991
Another pipe, Mr. Chow?

15:10.033 --> 15:11.033
Ah...

15:11.467 --> 15:15.834
I have to be very careful
riding on that dragon.

15:16.200 --> 15:19.058
You know, addiction can be very dangerous.

15:19.100 --> 15:20.358
Oh, my, my...

15:20.400 --> 15:23.500
Now you're turning into
a worrisome old man.

15:23.867 --> 15:25.625
We can't let that happen.

15:25.667 --> 15:26.667
Okay.

15:27.433 --> 15:29.400
I will take one more pipe.

15:29.767 --> 15:31.066
Thank goodness.

15:31.233 --> 15:34.001
A rich man like you should enjoy your life.

15:34.166 --> 15:36.001
Why waste a good time.

15:36.800 --> 15:42.158
Today we have a very high quality
of opium from the Sichuan Province,

15:42.200 --> 15:44.834
very smooth and refined.

15:45.033 --> 15:46.567
It came in yesterday.

15:46.734 --> 15:49.333
Smuggled across the Japanese lines?

15:49.800 --> 15:51.333
I suppose so.

15:52.800 --> 15:55.767
I heard a bit about the smuggling trade.

15:56.300 --> 16:00.533
War can sometimes be
very good for business.

16:01.033 --> 16:02.558
You trade with the Japanese?

16:02.600 --> 16:03.433
No

16:03.600 --> 16:08.767
Not exactly, but sometimes in
order to be successful in business.

16:09.200 --> 16:12.500
I do have to work all sides of the deal.

16:13.066 --> 16:14.800
I see.

16:16.233 --> 16:18.367
Do you have brother or sisters?

16:19.900 --> 16:21.233
One sister.

16:21.467 --> 16:23.233
Oh, in Hong Kong?

16:23.900 --> 16:28.767
Yeah, she works as a switchboard
operator at some government office.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.233
She probably gets to
learn a lot of secrets.

16:46.266 --> 16:48.100
How is the opium?

16:48.800 --> 16:50.333
Very good.

16:50.800 --> 16:51.800
Come on.

16:52.300 --> 16:53.734
Have a puff.

17:10.500 --> 17:13.925
So the Royal Scots are now dug in on the
Western sector of the Gin Drinkers Line.

17:13.967 --> 17:16.167
They still have the Punjabis
and Rajputs at the flanks.

17:16.300 --> 17:19.533
But heavy fighting is just
broken out on Golden Hill, sir.

17:20.200 --> 17:23.233
The Royal Scots must hold Golden Hill.

17:23.567 --> 17:26.792
Otherwise the Japs will
flood into Sham Shui Po,

17:26.834 --> 17:28.209
and then the rest of the Kowloon Peninsula.

17:28.233 --> 17:31.433
Yes sir, although we are having difficulties
reaching the frontline troops, sir.

17:32.166 --> 17:33.867
Our telegraph wires keep getting cut.

17:34.033 --> 17:35.467
Damn, fifth-columnists!

17:35.533 --> 17:36.325
Can it be stopped?

17:36.367 --> 17:37.576
It's hard to know who's who, sir.

17:37.600 --> 17:40.009
Even the Triads are involved and
they work for whomever pays the most.

17:40.033 --> 17:43.925
Which is why we need to be operating firing
squads, sir. Cut down these traitors at the knees.

17:43.967 --> 17:45.591
Operationally impossible.

17:45.633 --> 17:47.543
We just don't have the
resources to track them all down.

17:47.567 --> 17:51.058
Damn it Charles! Your boys need to pull their
bloody fingers out and get on top of this.

17:51.100 --> 17:52.533
All right, gentlemen.

17:52.700 --> 17:55.200
This is war, chaos.

17:55.367 --> 18:00.224
I know it's stressful, but we must keep our
focus of defending the Gin Drinkers Line.

18:00.266 --> 18:03.367
If that goes down the rest of the
Kowloon Peninsula goes with it.

18:03.533 --> 18:05.058
Continue, Mr. Armstrong.

18:05.100 --> 18:06.100
Yes, sir.

18:06.133 --> 18:08.767
Our forces are being
pounded in Shatin, sir,

18:08.934 --> 18:12.533
and the enemy has a column of light tanks
crossing at Lo Wu to support.

18:13.100 --> 18:15.060
This is looking like a
full frontal assault, sir.

18:15.367 --> 18:16.767
Bollocks!

18:17.066 --> 18:19.200
We need to keep a
step ahead of this, Gents.

18:19.967 --> 18:21.767
I spoke with Governor Young,

18:21.934 --> 18:26.158
and he agreed with the proposal
of destroying any supplies located in

18:26.200 --> 18:29.400
the Kowloon warehouses
that might be useful to the Japanese.

18:29.633 --> 18:31.991
Understood sir. I'll have the
Service Corps draw up a list.

18:32.033 --> 18:34.767
We'll destroy everything
we can in the next 24 hours.

18:35.200 --> 18:37.233
Is that to include the port facility, sir?

18:37.400 --> 18:39.191
Yes, get ready to blow up the docks.

18:39.233 --> 18:40.400
Yes, sir.

18:50.600 --> 18:54.500
Nice and easy, let the
opium roll into your body.

18:56.200 --> 18:59.367
Being here makes me
forget the world's problems.

18:59.567 --> 19:00.567
Yes.

19:00.600 --> 19:02.767
This club is like a pond of tranquility.

19:02.934 --> 19:04.333
Yeah.

19:05.400 --> 19:08.567
But I really should have left Hong Kong.

19:09.100 --> 19:11.667
I just didn't think the
Japanese would attack.

19:13.200 --> 19:16.100
Oh, well, there's no escaping it now.

19:17.100 --> 19:18.133
Should I continue?

19:18.300 --> 19:20.834
Yes, maybe one more?

19:25.700 --> 19:29.100
This is my only escape now.

19:43.166 --> 19:44.967
What are those?

19:45.133 --> 19:48.166
The latest fashions
from Paris and New York.

19:48.333 --> 19:50.867
Really? Looks like
fishing nets for tadpoles.

19:51.800 --> 19:54.024
You're such a village girl, Mei Fong.

19:54.066 --> 19:56.100
I mean, look at you.

19:57.400 --> 20:00.500
Well, thank goodness mother
isn't alive to see you here,

20:00.800 --> 20:02.433
with male strangers and all.

20:02.600 --> 20:05.667
Well, our mother wasn't
as tightly wound up as you.

20:05.834 --> 20:07.500
She might have liked these.

20:08.600 --> 20:10.700
Is he your latest catch?

20:12.500 --> 20:13.900
Why do you care?

20:14.300 --> 20:15.900
I have seen him before.

20:16.800 --> 20:20.800
Mr. Chow, he's one of the
richest bachelors in Hong Kong.

20:21.100 --> 20:22.900
Mr Chow?

20:23.200 --> 20:29.967
Seriously sister, you need to get
out more often, expand your horizons.

20:31.500 --> 20:34.825
Any young men in uniform
caught your fancy yet?

20:34.867 --> 20:35.934
No!

20:37.066 --> 20:39.200
I need to help you with your wardrobe.

20:39.433 --> 20:43.367
The village girl look comes
across a bit old-fashioned.

20:43.433 --> 20:45.967
I don't need stockings to
make my legs look good.

20:46.133 --> 20:48.391
Okay, okay, I'll drop it.

20:48.433 --> 20:51.367
Look, I came here to tell you
that I had to sell the cow.

20:51.533 --> 20:54.967
With food prices rising so fast,
it would soon have been stolen.

20:55.700 --> 20:57.166
Here's your share.

21:00.100 --> 21:01.300
Thanks.

21:01.700 --> 21:05.066
You have been taking care of
that cow for the past two years,

21:06.300 --> 21:10.867
So really, it is yours.

21:11.100 --> 21:12.467
Alright

21:12.800 --> 21:14.133
Thank you.

21:15.033 --> 21:17.233
This Thursday is your birthday.

21:17.400 --> 21:19.233
How about I come over?

21:19.400 --> 21:21.600
That would be fun.

21:22.200 --> 21:23.358
You know, this year,

21:23.400 --> 21:25.066
it's the year of the snake.

21:25.200 --> 21:28.658
Oh, hopefully we won't see any of those.

22:09.200 --> 22:11.600
Shit, the Japs have tanks.

22:13.300 --> 22:14.900
Bloody bastards, they do.

23:02.100 --> 23:04.033
Sargent, Hari is hurt.

23:04.233 --> 23:04.834
What happened?

23:04.967 --> 23:05.967
Vihann is dead.

23:06.033 --> 23:08.333
And we saw a column of
tanks on Castle Peak Road.

23:08.533 --> 23:09.533
Call it in! Call it in!

23:09.667 --> 23:10.291
Yes, sir.

23:10.333 --> 23:12.867
Japanese tanks have been
spotted on Castle Peak Road.

23:13.033 --> 23:14.876
Better warn the troops
holding the forward positions...

23:14.900 --> 23:16.925
I feel really dizzy.

23:16.967 --> 23:17.692
You will be fine.

23:17.734 --> 23:19.300
You will be fine man, come on!

23:19.467 --> 23:21.567
You got this far, you got it.

23:22.433 --> 23:25.000
I can't think straight,
I can't think straight...

23:43.667 --> 23:45.500
Are you ok?

23:45.734 --> 23:47.333
Are you ok?

23:56.567 --> 23:58.567
Give it to my mother.

23:59.934 --> 24:01.633
I will.

24:37.700 --> 24:43.633
With the Gin Drinkers Line broken, we're going to have to shore
up our defensive postures along the beaches of Hong Kong Island.

24:43.800 --> 24:46.767
It's only a matter of time before
the Japanese make a run at it.

24:47.300 --> 24:48.867
How about the Lye Mun passage, sir?

24:49.200 --> 24:51.576
It's the narrowest waterway
between Hong Kong Island and Kowloon.

24:51.600 --> 24:53.000
Not where my focus would be, sir.

24:53.200 --> 24:54.900
Our coastal gun batteries have it covered.

24:55.066 --> 24:57.325
If the Japanese occupy the Kowloon shore,

24:57.367 --> 25:00.300
they'll simply shell Hong
Kong Island to smitheries.

25:00.467 --> 25:01.425
Maybe sir.

25:01.467 --> 25:05.967
But my instinct tells me the Japanese will try to
preserve Victoria, the city, at least the main buildings.

25:06.200 --> 25:08.133
Did you forgot what they did in Nanking?

25:08.500 --> 25:11.166
You are supposed to be the
Japanese expert, by here by God.

25:11.500 --> 25:12.825
Get up to speed, old boy.

25:12.867 --> 25:14.767
I know full well their history.

25:14.934 --> 25:19.400
But in addition to looking at the historical context,
we need to consider this from a strategic point of view.

25:19.900 --> 25:22.000
Nanking was not a port city.

25:22.800 --> 25:24.900
If I were an admiral in the Japanese Navy,

25:25.066 --> 25:27.066
my objective would be
to keep the city intact.

25:27.400 --> 25:30.960
They're going to need a good base in this area
for their upcoming war with the Americans.

25:31.033 --> 25:34.734
Well, that's a major reason why we would be
blowing up much of the port facilities.

25:34.900 --> 25:37.934
Regardless, It's the Japanese Army
that's currently conducting the fight.

25:38.133 --> 25:40.293
The Japanese Army and Navy
don't often see eye to eye.

25:40.400 --> 25:42.967
There's a lot of infighting in
Tokyo's military command.

25:43.133 --> 25:47.300
Charles, I understand your knowledge
of the Japanese is second to none.

25:47.467 --> 25:49.934
Are you perhaps giving them
more credit than they deserve?

25:50.100 --> 25:51.676
I mean they have
mishandled China for years.

25:51.700 --> 25:53.400
Why would they be more enlightened now?

25:53.567 --> 25:57.934
Charles, the Japanese have proven to be
consistently inflexible in their military strategy.

25:58.100 --> 26:02.500
Again and again, they've shown they prefer
to use the sledgehammer to the scalpel.

26:02.667 --> 26:05.600
Gentlemen, Pearl Harbor
happened just five days ago!

26:05.767 --> 26:07.166
An outlier, Charles.

26:07.333 --> 26:13.024
We can't adapt our entire Japanese strategy because of
one lucky strike against an enemy with their pants down.

26:13.066 --> 26:15.367
That operation was led
by the Japanese Navy,

26:15.533 --> 26:18.767
After such a smashing success, I'd wager
they had the upper hand in Tokyo now.

26:19.100 --> 26:20.667
Point taken.

26:21.166 --> 26:23.834
But it's the Japanese Army
we are currently fighting against.

26:24.000 --> 26:28.467
Sir, the Japanese have sunk
HMS Repulse and HMS Prince of Wales.

26:30.266 --> 26:31.433
Both ships?

26:31.600 --> 26:33.867
Aye, sir. We just received
word from Singapore,

26:34.033 --> 26:36.600
Japanese aircraft caught
them off the coast of Malaya.

26:36.800 --> 26:38.867
Both vessels lost.

26:40.100 --> 26:41.333
Thank you, James.

26:41.500 --> 26:43.100
Goddammit man!

26:43.633 --> 26:46.867
If an aircraft can sink a top
of the line British battleship,

26:47.033 --> 26:47.767
what next?

26:47.934 --> 26:50.959
Without those ships, how are
we going to resupply from the sea?

26:51.001 --> 26:52.081
It will be impossible, sir.

26:52.233 --> 26:53.233
It's a bloody disaster.

26:53.567 --> 26:54.458
Sir.

26:54.500 --> 26:55.734
If I may...

26:56.400 --> 26:59.166
We are on a razor's edge
regards to morale in this city.

26:59.533 --> 27:01.867
In many ways we're
fighting a multi-front battle.

27:02.400 --> 27:03.667
The land battle,

27:03.834 --> 27:04.900
the sea battle,

27:05.100 --> 27:07.667
and also, a psychological battle.

27:08.033 --> 27:11.100
We need to be careful how this
news is released to the public.

27:11.300 --> 27:14.767
The last thing we want
is panic in the streets.

27:15.266 --> 27:16.734
Alright.

27:17.233 --> 27:19.467
I want you to tell Governor Young,

27:19.667 --> 27:21.391
about the loss of the battleships.

27:21.433 --> 27:22.793
He'll understand the implications.

27:22.967 --> 27:25.467
And caution him on how
the news should be released.

27:25.633 --> 27:27.000
Sir, I will send a full report.

27:27.200 --> 27:30.158
Also update Brigadiers Wallis and Lawson.

27:30.200 --> 27:31.200
Yes, sir.

27:31.367 --> 27:36.001
Charles, we're going to need an up-to-date
inventory on all food and supplies on the island.

27:36.600 --> 27:40.001
We're gonna have to make some painful
calculations on how long we can hold out here.

27:40.166 --> 27:41.633
Yes, sir. I will get right on it.

27:42.633 --> 27:43.967
What a cockup!

27:44.133 --> 27:44.991
It changes everything.

27:45.033 --> 27:47.200
Bloody Japs!

27:53.667 --> 27:55.500
You're turning 25 now.

27:55.834 --> 27:58.191
Maybe it's time to find you a husband?

27:58.233 --> 28:00.800
Oh, sis, I don't want
one of your connections.

28:01.433 --> 28:04.633
I didn't mean that
silly, not from the club.

28:04.967 --> 28:09.000
I was thinking of maybe
someone from the village.

28:09.367 --> 28:10.834
A pig farmer!

28:11.834 --> 28:14.533
Sis, I am going to take
my time on this one.

28:15.266 --> 28:18.133
I want someone reliable.

28:19.600 --> 28:20.600
Goodness,

28:20.633 --> 28:22.734
Good luck with that, men...

28:23.066 --> 28:26.133
Well, men they often go astray.

28:27.600 --> 28:29.033
Which reminds me.

28:29.233 --> 28:32.767
That man from the club, that Mr Chow.

28:33.433 --> 28:34.967
What about him?

28:36.734 --> 28:38.800
He is a collaborator.

28:39.166 --> 28:40.333
A what?

28:40.500 --> 28:41.725
He works for the Japanese.

28:41.767 --> 28:43.633
Oh Jesus, give it a break.

28:44.001 --> 28:46.467
You really have an overactive imagination,

28:46.667 --> 28:48.991
besides, how would you know who he is?

28:49.033 --> 28:50.767
I saw his photo at work.

28:51.300 --> 28:52.600
You have to be careful.

28:52.767 --> 28:55.287
I can't give you any details,
nor should I be telling you this.

28:55.800 --> 28:56.800
Just...

28:57.100 --> 28:57.858
keep your distance.

28:57.900 --> 29:00.000
That's all you have? A hunch?

29:00.900 --> 29:05.233
He is a Japanese collaborator, get it,
and you're sleeping with the enemy!

29:06.300 --> 29:08.200
Jesus, give it a break!

29:08.400 --> 29:11.200
Don't give me that bloody
nonsense, not from you.

29:11.767 --> 29:14.792
Opium, prostitution,
that club has a reputation.

29:14.834 --> 29:15.834
My job,

29:15.967 --> 29:17.158
pay for this house.

29:17.200 --> 29:19.266
So you're benefiting from my work.

29:19.433 --> 29:21.667
Don't be such a lily-white righteous bitch.

29:22.100 --> 29:25.734
My fucking job allows you for
your holier-than-thou lifestyle.

29:25.900 --> 29:27.600
Really? Is that how you see it?

29:27.934 --> 29:29.767
I was the one who took care of mother.

29:29.934 --> 29:30.934
You left!

29:31.400 --> 29:33.233
Because we are fucking dirt poor.

29:33.400 --> 29:35.133
No rice, no pigs.

29:35.300 --> 29:36.300
No income!

29:36.367 --> 29:38.767
Someone in our family has to make a living.

29:38.967 --> 29:40.367
That's not how it is.

29:40.900 --> 29:43.734
You detest village life, you
found the city more glamorous.

29:43.900 --> 29:45.133
You never liked it here.

29:45.300 --> 29:47.266
Have you finished preaching?

29:50.100 --> 29:51.200
I'm sorry.

29:52.600 --> 29:54.367
But this war...

29:54.700 --> 29:57.066
This war is making the city more dangerous.

29:57.934 --> 29:58.934
And...

29:59.100 --> 30:00.967
if you ever want to come back.

30:01.400 --> 30:02.533
Stay here.

30:03.300 --> 30:05.200
You're always welcome.

30:05.500 --> 30:08.100
You think Hong Kong
will fall to the Japanese?

30:08.433 --> 30:10.001
Hong Kong is a fortress.

30:10.166 --> 30:13.467
We are surrounded by the
water, the sea just like England.

30:13.633 --> 30:15.867
If the Germans failed to invade Britain,

30:16.033 --> 30:19.000
then the Japanese most certainly
will fail attacking this island.

30:19.300 --> 30:22.166
That is not what I'm hearing
from inside the Battlebox.

30:23.100 --> 30:25.000
Things are not as rosy as you may see.

30:25.600 --> 30:27.433
As you may read in the papers.

30:28.600 --> 30:30.600
We are on our own Mei Fong.

30:30.900 --> 30:33.133
There's no backup plan for us.

30:34.100 --> 30:36.734
Our British father abandoned us as kids.

30:37.100 --> 30:39.367
Our Chinese mother died of overwork.

30:40.100 --> 30:44.000
We are just a couple of Eurasian kids
stuck in the middle of nowhere.

30:44.300 --> 30:45.400
Nowhere!

30:45.800 --> 30:47.467
We don't have many choice.

30:48.400 --> 30:50.567
Just be careful of Mr. Chow.

30:50.800 --> 30:52.867
He is working for the wrong side.

30:53.734 --> 30:54.734
And...

30:54.900 --> 30:56.066
I'm just saying.

30:56.500 --> 30:59.000
At the end, at the end of all this...

30:59.133 --> 31:01.834
You have to choose a side, we all do.

31:02.600 --> 31:05.400
There is no middle ground.

31:10.400 --> 31:13.491
According to this communication
we received four days ago.

31:13.533 --> 31:17.734
There are 50,000 KMT troops heading
directly for us across the Canton Province.

31:18.066 --> 31:19.934
Ah, that would be a God-send.

31:20.266 --> 31:23.725
Really smash up the rear
guard of the Japanese forces,

31:23.767 --> 31:26.233
put their heads in a vice,
knock the stuffing out of them.

31:26.400 --> 31:28.266
Yes sir, we're expecting
them in seven days.

31:28.600 --> 31:30.867
Charles, any confirmation
on these troop movements?

31:31.033 --> 31:31.991
Unfortunately not, sir.

31:32.033 --> 31:33.900
We have agents all over Canton Province,

31:34.266 --> 31:37.400
but no verifiable reports of any large
KMT units operating in the area.

31:37.567 --> 31:40.333
Then we need more agents on the ground,
find out what's happening.

31:40.500 --> 31:42.400
We can't have another military cockup.

31:42.567 --> 31:45.200
I'm just saying,
there's no confirmation of these troops.

31:46.066 --> 31:48.300
It's right here on this
piece of paper, Charles.

31:48.633 --> 31:49.934
50,000 troops.

31:50.100 --> 31:51.500
It's right here!

31:51.667 --> 31:53.934
That message proves nothing!

31:54.400 --> 31:56.166
First we lose the battleships.

31:56.600 --> 31:58.458
Then the Gin Drinkers Line fails,

31:58.500 --> 32:02.767
and now we don't know whether 50,000
KMT troops might be nothing but a mirage.

32:03.133 --> 32:04.834
How could things get so messed up?

32:05.000 --> 32:05.600
Sir.

32:05.700 --> 32:08.834
I'm only saying this
message makes no sense.

32:09.800 --> 32:12.633
The KMT lacked the resources
to move their troops quickly.

32:13.166 --> 32:17.166
I would estimate if the information is true,
the likely arrival date would be mid-January.

32:17.533 --> 32:19.233
We can't wait until mid-January, sir.

32:19.567 --> 32:21.600
We can barely hold out until next week.

32:21.767 --> 32:25.658
Get an urgent word out to Chiang Kai-shek
on the urgent need for his troops.

32:25.700 --> 32:29.958
Surely, he'll understand the importance of
maintaining a British presence here in Hong Kong.

32:30.000 --> 32:30.591
Yes sir.

32:30.633 --> 32:32.033
I'll send another cable.

32:37.500 --> 32:39.033
What is that?

32:39.367 --> 32:40.876
Captain Singh, go see what that's about?

32:40.900 --> 32:41.967
Yes, sir.

32:44.200 --> 32:46.767
General, I would caution,

32:48.300 --> 32:51.000
If the KMT confirmed troops are on the way,

32:51.367 --> 32:53.191
they frequently say one
thing then do another.

32:53.233 --> 32:54.325
Understood.

32:54.367 --> 32:56.333
But we're walking a tightrope here.

32:56.667 --> 33:00.200
The KMT's imminent arrival has
boosted morale here in Hong Kong.

33:00.533 --> 33:02.700
If the news turns out to be false,

33:02.900 --> 33:04.058
Well...

33:04.100 --> 33:05.900
It might be best to keep things quiet.

33:06.233 --> 33:08.934
There's no doubt the
Japanese noose is tightening.

33:09.300 --> 33:11.734
Maybe it's better to have
people think help is on its way.

33:11.900 --> 33:14.467
Otherwise we'll have trouble
holding the Colony together.

33:15.333 --> 33:17.892
Sir, it is the damn sentry relief, sir.

33:17.934 --> 33:19.258
One of them dropped his Bren Gun.

33:19.300 --> 33:22.325
Negligent discharge. Sepoy
Ghulam Rasul is shot in the stomach.

33:22.367 --> 33:23.910
Calm down, Captain, pull yourself together.

33:23.934 --> 33:25.100
Calm?

33:25.500 --> 33:27.133
This is an amateur stupidity.

33:27.300 --> 33:30.333
You would not ask me to calm if
it was one of the British soldiers.

33:31.233 --> 33:33.433
I know when we are retreating from Kowloon,

33:33.600 --> 33:36.100
Indians are going to be the
last ones, always the last.

33:36.300 --> 33:36.925
Right?

33:36.967 --> 33:40.591
You'll get the Scots out first, and we
are going to be the cannon fodder again.

33:40.633 --> 33:43.633
Stand aside, Captain, that will
be Brigadier Wallis's decision.

33:43.800 --> 33:45.633
He'll do what's best.

33:46.200 --> 33:47.734
Yes, sir.

34:12.467 --> 34:13.967
Over there!

34:15.767 --> 34:16.767
Over there, over there!

34:17.100 --> 34:18.433
Behind the tree!

34:19.300 --> 34:20.967
There is so many of them!

34:26.867 --> 34:28.166
We are being surrounded.

34:29.767 --> 34:30.858
Behind the tree!

34:30.900 --> 34:31.900
Got him.

34:33.400 --> 34:36.166
They are circling us, they
are circling us everywhere.

34:36.900 --> 34:38.767
There must be over 20 Japs out there!

34:48.667 --> 34:49.743
They are shredding us apart.

34:49.767 --> 34:50.925
Cover our flanks!

34:50.967 --> 34:52.533
They are coming in.

34:54.233 --> 34:55.800
I am running low on ammunition.

34:55.967 --> 34:56.925
How much you have?

34:56.967 --> 34:58.133
Four more rounds, sir.

34:58.300 --> 34:59.700
Make it count!

35:03.433 --> 35:04.633
Fucking Japs!

35:04.800 --> 35:06.400
I'm out, I'm out!

35:07.834 --> 35:09.100
I'm done, sir!

35:32.133 --> 35:34.400
On your knees!

36:12.967 --> 36:15.100
I thought you would leave by now.

36:15.467 --> 36:19.500
Where would I go? Singapore, Manila?

36:20.200 --> 36:21.967
The whole World is blown to bits.

36:22.400 --> 36:24.467
One of my friends went to Macau.

36:24.800 --> 36:27.333
All the refugees are going to Macau.

36:27.900 --> 36:29.500
Who's gonna feed them all?

36:29.700 --> 36:32.266
I guess here is better than.

36:33.700 --> 36:36.700
Ah, you never know what's
gonna happen tomorrow, though.

36:37.533 --> 36:39.033
At times of War,

36:39.200 --> 36:42.033
everything is unexpected.

36:43.800 --> 36:45.333
Another pipe?

36:46.300 --> 36:49.300
Maybe I can smoke my way to Macau.

36:57.100 --> 36:58.667
Ladies...

37:00.100 --> 37:04.300
be careful cooking the opium tonight.
It's getting very expensive.

37:07.200 --> 37:11.834
Even the more experienced smugglers are
having problems bringing opium into the city.

37:12.533 --> 37:17.767
With all the fighting going on,
I suppose, our business will go down.

37:18.100 --> 37:21.066
Don't be so sure. We have
a very compelling product.

37:21.533 --> 37:23.266
Our women?

37:25.000 --> 37:28.667
Opium, our clients need their daily fix.

37:29.400 --> 37:32.734
You know before working at the Pearl Club,
I used to work at a club in Canton.

37:33.066 --> 37:36.333
Mostly Japanese customers,
wealthy merchants, top brass.

37:36.934 --> 37:39.867
It was one of the best
clubs in all of South China.

37:40.233 --> 37:41.158
Good money?

37:41.200 --> 37:43.600
Very good, very profitable, too.

37:44.834 --> 37:46.834
But, you know, sometimes a bad customer.

37:47.166 --> 37:48.400
You know the type.

37:48.900 --> 37:52.767
Yeah, always try to avoid those guys.

37:54.500 --> 37:57.767
I noticed you are spending
a lot of time with Mr. Chow.

37:58.533 --> 37:59.834
Do you like him?

38:00.033 --> 38:02.467
Mr. Chow, he's very generous.

38:02.633 --> 38:04.633
Treat me with good respect.

38:05.400 --> 38:09.066
I noticed he was at the
Canton Club a few times.

38:09.567 --> 38:12.300
Always with high
ranking Japanese officials.

38:13.200 --> 38:17.467
Yes, he smuggled goods throughout
all of China, even to the Japanese.

38:17.900 --> 38:22.000
Yeah, well, they were mostly military
officials and they paid for everything,

38:22.333 --> 38:24.800
the best opium, the best girls.

38:25.133 --> 38:26.625
Mr. Chow did not pay?

38:26.667 --> 38:28.001
That was the funny part.

38:28.166 --> 38:31.967
Mostly the wealthy merchants who hosted
the Japanese to gain favorites and such.

38:32.200 --> 38:34.734
But not Mr. Chow.
It worked the other way for him.

38:35.066 --> 38:38.467
The Japanese treated
Mr. Chow, very, very well.

38:38.800 --> 38:40.834
Hmm, I see.

38:41.400 --> 38:44.333
Anyways, just be careful.

38:44.700 --> 38:47.500
The tricky men can seem the most kind

38:48.100 --> 38:50.633
It's not like I'm about to marry him.

38:50.800 --> 38:52.467
You know, he was married once.

38:52.800 --> 38:56.066
His wife died in a bombing
in Shanghai a few years ago.

38:56.767 --> 38:58.300
Probably gang related.

38:58.633 --> 39:01.667
But at least that's what I heard
from one of the girls at the club.

39:02.400 --> 39:05.533
It's hard to know who
is fighting who in China.

39:06.100 --> 39:09.233
Japanese, KMT, Triads,

39:09.700 --> 39:11.200
Communists...

39:11.600 --> 39:13.333
The lines keep shifting.

39:13.500 --> 39:15.633
And the money keeps rolling in.

39:16.900 --> 39:18.500
I suppose,

39:19.333 --> 39:21.700
it's all about the money.

39:23.300 --> 39:26.767
We are all slaves to it.

39:44.333 --> 39:46.033
Sir.

39:47.700 --> 39:49.376
We couldn't reach some
of the Rajput units in time.

39:49.400 --> 39:51.500
They were scattered during the fighting.

39:52.500 --> 39:56.020
Some of them may not received orders to fall
back to Hong Kong Island when we evacuated.

39:56.967 --> 39:58.800
If they didn't make it back,

39:59.934 --> 40:01.900
nothing we can do for them now.

40:03.500 --> 40:05.867
The Island is all we have now boys.

40:06.200 --> 40:08.867
And the Japs aren't going to
stand for that for much longer.

40:11.800 --> 40:13.266
Chin up, lads...

40:13.900 --> 40:15.900
We're not dead yet.

40:30.700 --> 40:32.834
Do you know this man?

40:34.800 --> 40:36.834
No, not really.

40:38.433 --> 40:40.367
What do you mean, not really?

40:42.100 --> 40:44.100
I heard you speak about him briefly.

40:44.600 --> 40:46.001
And?

40:47.000 --> 40:49.867
And he may be a bad
person from what I have heard.

40:51.100 --> 40:53.333
Any other connection with this man?

40:53.734 --> 40:55.333
No.

40:57.100 --> 40:59.800
You have a sister named
Yu Siu Fong, do you not?

41:00.100 --> 41:01.667
Yes, I do.

41:02.066 --> 41:06.433
Did you break security protocol and reveal
anything to your sister about Mr. Chow?

41:07.767 --> 41:09.567
You did, didn't you?

41:12.100 --> 41:14.734
Yes a little bit, but just to protect her.

41:20.900 --> 41:22.667
Do you remember your first day here?

41:23.100 --> 41:27.500
Do you remember the conversation I had with the Colonel
about Mr. Chow when I put his photo down on your desk?

41:27.633 --> 41:28.558
Yes, I remember.

41:28.600 --> 41:31.600
You see Mei Fong, that was a test.

41:32.600 --> 41:36.200
We wanted to see if
you would spill the beans.

41:38.400 --> 41:43.100
Here inside the Battlebox,
secrecy is of the utmost importance.

41:44.700 --> 41:48.834
If we have people working here
revealing details of our operations,

41:49.500 --> 41:52.300
Then effectively we have a leak.

41:54.800 --> 41:57.633
And guess who's in
charge of fixing those leaks?

41:58.800 --> 42:01.133
I suppose you are.

42:04.133 --> 42:05.900
Quite right.

42:21.700 --> 42:24.066
Where are the others? Answer!

42:24.400 --> 42:25.533
We don't know, sir.

42:25.700 --> 42:27.200
Where are the other soldiers?

42:27.367 --> 42:28.367
Talk!

42:28.500 --> 42:29.767
I don't know, sir.

42:29.900 --> 42:31.133
Search them.

42:32.300 --> 42:33.667
What have you got?
- Nothing, sir.

42:33.834 --> 42:35.934
What have you got?
- Nothing, sir.

42:36.066 --> 42:37.066
Maps?

42:37.300 --> 42:38.333
Documents?

42:38.667 --> 42:40.066
Money?

42:40.233 --> 42:41.734
I have some in my left pocket.

42:44.667 --> 42:45.558
What else?

42:45.600 --> 42:47.834
I have nothing more,
sir. I have nothing more.

42:48.333 --> 42:49.358
You find anything?

42:49.400 --> 42:52.266
Watch, coins, nothing else.

42:55.600 --> 42:57.767
I guess the British don't pay you much.

42:58.867 --> 43:01.133
Is this worth your life?

43:06.033 --> 43:08.266
Soldier! Execute them!

43:08.867 --> 43:10.500
Follow me, we are going back.

43:10.667 --> 43:12.834
No, please don't kill me! No!

43:13.066 --> 43:14.124
Don't kill me!

43:14.166 --> 43:15.433
No, no...

43:16.800 --> 43:18.000
No!

43:19.033 --> 43:20.934
Have mercy.

43:22.367 --> 43:23.767
Have mercy!

43:24.333 --> 43:25.800
Don't do this!

43:25.967 --> 43:27.200
No, don't do this.

43:30.033 --> 43:31.867
Don't do this. No.

43:33.900 --> 43:35.100
No.

43:57.433 --> 43:58.625
Buddhist charm?

43:58.667 --> 43:59.667
Yes it is.

43:59.767 --> 44:02.967
Buddhist charm, it's a Buddhist charm.

44:40.100 --> 44:40.758
Sir.

44:40.800 --> 44:43.166
We have received
communication from Sai Wan Ho

44:43.333 --> 44:45.233
that the Japanese have
landed a sizable force

44:45.400 --> 44:47.166
on the eastern part of Hong Kong Island.

44:47.333 --> 44:48.333
Where exactly?

44:48.400 --> 44:49.967
The Lye Mun Passage, sir.

44:50.200 --> 44:52.000
It's probably just a diversion.

44:52.867 --> 44:56.400
That sector doesn't have a good
landing sites for a large Japanese force.

44:56.767 --> 44:59.200
How could they land their
armor or artillery pieces?

44:59.367 --> 45:00.834
Let's not take the bait.

45:01.100 --> 45:04.058
The beaches of Deepwater Bay, Repulse Bay,

45:04.100 --> 45:07.458
or a direct amphibious assault
from Tsim Sha Tsui to Victoria

45:07.500 --> 45:10.200
are still the most likely
points for a Japanese entry.

45:10.400 --> 45:13.066
The Lye Mun Passage is
probably just a diversion.

45:13.233 --> 45:13.792
Sir.

45:13.834 --> 45:16.158
While the southern beaches
would make better landing zones.

45:16.200 --> 45:20.467
The Lye Man Passage is the narrowest
waterway, only a few hundred yards.

45:20.633 --> 45:22.633
Japanese troops could actually swim across.

45:22.800 --> 45:25.091
Swim across, really Charles?
With all their equipment?

45:25.133 --> 45:27.509
Are there any reports of how
many boats the Japanese are using?

45:27.533 --> 45:29.400
It's pitch black outside, sir.

45:29.633 --> 45:31.376
It's difficult for our
spotters to get an estimate,

45:31.400 --> 45:34.300
but the reports seem to indicate
a few small fishing vessels.

45:34.600 --> 45:37.333
You can't land an Army
on a few fishing boats.

45:37.667 --> 45:39.400
Remember Dunkirk?

45:39.700 --> 45:43.100
They're over 800 vessels at Dunkirk.

45:43.266 --> 45:47.834
The Japanese will be lucky to find 20 or
30 fishing boats. We sank everything else.

45:48.000 --> 45:49.892
They could still swim across in 20 minutes.

45:49.934 --> 45:52.333
It's darker than the devil's
asshole out there, Charles!

45:52.533 --> 45:53.900
No one's swimming anywhere!

45:54.066 --> 45:56.266
Colonel, I agree it would be a bold move,

45:56.433 --> 46:00.400
but not impossible to move thousands
of troops by swimming across the channel.

46:01.500 --> 46:04.967
Even if by some miracle they
managed to swim to the other side,

46:05.300 --> 46:07.800
their rifles would be sopping wet, Charles.

46:07.967 --> 46:10.166
Be about as useful as a soggy crumpet.

46:10.233 --> 46:12.433
On the surface, yes, it
would seem foolhardy.

46:12.600 --> 46:16.000
But Pearl Harbor was also a
bold move that paid off brilliantly.

46:16.400 --> 46:19.467
Can we get any confirmation on the size
of the Japanese landings?

46:19.734 --> 46:20.734
Yes, sir.

46:20.767 --> 46:22.700
Sir, I know we're flying blind here.

46:22.867 --> 46:25.427
But by the time that report gets
back to us, it may be too late.

46:25.567 --> 46:27.066
It's only a 20 minute swim.

46:27.233 --> 46:31.000
In an hour or two, there could be thousands
of Japanese troops on Hong Kong Island.

46:47.433 --> 46:49.066
Hello, operator?

46:49.433 --> 46:50.433
Yes.

46:50.600 --> 46:52.934
Please can you patch me
through to the Pearl Club?

46:53.600 --> 46:55.166
Yes, thank you.

46:57.867 --> 46:59.467
Hello, mama-san?

46:59.700 --> 47:02.333
It's me, Mei Fong, Siu Fong's sister.

47:02.800 --> 47:04.367
Please may I speak to her?

47:05.400 --> 47:06.867
Yes, it is urgent.

47:11.700 --> 47:13.001
Siu Fong, it's me.

47:13.500 --> 47:16.500
Listen, I have something
important to give you.

47:16.800 --> 47:18.600
Please can you come round in person?

47:19.300 --> 47:21.800
No, I can't explain to
you on the phone... No...

47:23.967 --> 47:25.033
Alright.

47:25.500 --> 47:27.533
Okay, I will see you in a few hours.

47:28.100 --> 47:29.533
Bye.

47:52.433 --> 47:53.900
Everybody out!

47:54.834 --> 47:56.667
Everyone out!

47:58.300 --> 48:00.000
Everyone out!

48:00.533 --> 48:01.900
Everyone out!

48:02.900 --> 48:04.600
Everyone out!

48:06.834 --> 48:08.767
Everyone out!

48:12.934 --> 48:15.066
Everybody out!

48:16.667 --> 48:18.633
Everybody out!

48:20.767 --> 48:22.500
Everybody out!

49:01.700 --> 49:02.700
The Japanese

49:02.900 --> 49:03.900
The Japanese

49:03.934 --> 49:05.200
The Japanese...

49:05.967 --> 49:07.200
What happened to you?

49:07.400 --> 49:09.633
Most of the island has
fallen to the Japanese.

49:09.834 --> 49:12.934
The roads are blocked, and I just
came back from Sheung Wan District.

49:13.300 --> 49:14.834
Is it still under the British control?

49:15.000 --> 49:18.200
Yes, but the Japanese have
taken over Queen Mary Hospital.

49:18.367 --> 49:20.600
They're attacking the villages in the area.

49:20.767 --> 49:21.892
Puk Fu Lam?

49:21.934 --> 49:23.200
Yes, probably.

49:23.367 --> 49:25.333
The city is collapsing.

49:25.867 --> 49:27.066
Alright, ladies.

49:27.233 --> 49:29.100
Ladies...

49:31.867 --> 49:33.600
It's just a little bump in the road.

49:33.900 --> 49:36.667
In reality, in desperate times,

49:37.000 --> 49:40.133
a little opium will sooth
many ills of the world.

49:40.700 --> 49:43.066
Our business can survive a war.

49:43.400 --> 49:46.700
Maybe different customers,
different uniforms.

49:48.100 --> 49:52.001
But at the end, there's always
a human need to have a good time.

49:54.400 --> 49:58.033
Besides, I will double your
wages at the end of the month.

49:58.367 --> 50:01.600
Mama-san, I need to go to see my sister.

50:02.200 --> 50:06.100
I see, alright, be careful,
it's dangerous outside.

50:16.200 --> 50:18.166
We cannot surrender, Charles.

50:18.333 --> 50:23.000
We have orders direct from Prime Minister
Churchill that we're to fight to the last man.

50:23.166 --> 50:25.066
Colonel, our men have done their duty,

50:25.233 --> 50:28.467
thousands dead on the battlefield,
thousands more badly injured and dying.

50:28.633 --> 50:31.142
You expect the Japanese to honor
any sort of surrender agreement?

50:31.166 --> 50:34.124
The second we put our guns down,
we're as good as dead.

50:34.166 --> 50:37.491
We've lost control. Our troops are
scattered. They're operating blind.

50:37.533 --> 50:38.900
Then we fight blind, Charles!

50:39.066 --> 50:40.325
We have our orders!

50:40.367 --> 50:42.700
But at a certain point
is becomes pointless!

50:42.867 --> 50:45.500
We can't resupply them with
ammunition, much less food.

50:45.667 --> 50:46.425
Sir.

50:46.467 --> 50:49.343
We just received reports the Japanese
have taken over Tai Tam water reservoir.

50:49.367 --> 50:51.900
Nonsense, I was just talking to Jack Flegg.

50:52.233 --> 50:53.725
Get him on the blower now!

50:53.767 --> 50:54.767
Sir.

51:00.100 --> 51:01.133
Hello

51:01.700 --> 51:02.700
Hello

51:02.867 --> 51:05.333
Sir, it sounds like they're
speaking Japanese.

51:05.500 --> 51:06.792
Put it on speaker.

51:06.834 --> 51:07.834
Yes, sir.

51:09.233 --> 51:11.033
Hello, Tommy...

51:11.400 --> 51:13.233
Hello, Tommy?

51:24.700 --> 51:26.066
Yes...

51:34.133 --> 51:35.934
What did they say?

51:36.300 --> 51:37.633
They're coming for us.

51:37.800 --> 51:39.066
Like bullocks, they are.

51:39.500 --> 51:41.533
They shut off water to the city.

51:42.400 --> 51:45.176
The Japanese are forcing our hand,
our troops can't fight without water.

51:45.200 --> 51:47.743
We are in the bloody tropics, Charles!
There is water everywhere.

51:47.767 --> 51:50.433
Our boys still have a
few days in the tank yet.

51:50.934 --> 51:52.900
What about the local population?

51:55.200 --> 51:58.834
There are always casualties, Charles!

52:27.800 --> 52:29.700
Mei Fong

52:31.734 --> 52:33.500
Mei Fong

52:35.467 --> 52:37.266
Mei Fong, listen to me.

52:42.900 --> 52:45.500
Who did this to you?

52:46.133 --> 52:47.300
Oh...

52:50.166 --> 52:52.734
Now listen to me, Mei Fong.

52:58.033 --> 52:59.433
Mei Fong!!!

53:02.767 --> 53:04.834
I love you!

53:23.667 --> 53:26.033
Who did that to you?

54:19.900 --> 54:22.233
It's Lieutenant Colonel
Stewart, sir, in Wan Chai.

54:22.400 --> 54:24.200
He says they can't hold
the line much longer.

54:24.367 --> 54:26.734
Alright, put him on the speaker.

54:29.233 --> 54:30.233
Hello?

54:30.400 --> 54:31.591
Stuart, Maltby here.

54:31.633 --> 54:33.158
Maltby...? Is that you?

54:33.200 --> 54:35.224
Yes, it's General Maltby.
What's your status?

54:35.266 --> 54:38.333
The line is breaking, sir.
We can't hold out much longer!

54:38.400 --> 54:40.567
Any reserves? Anything that
can plug up the gap?

54:40.767 --> 54:44.425
No one sir. We have no reserves.
Everyone is on the line already.

54:45.166 --> 54:46.958
Hello, Stuart... Stuart!

54:47.000 --> 54:48.467
We have Japs inside!

54:48.633 --> 54:49.958
Godamnit! The doorway...

54:51.300 --> 54:51.892
Stuart

54:51.934 --> 54:53.100
Are you there?

54:53.266 --> 54:54.266
Stuart!!!

54:55.100 --> 54:56.633
Can you reconnect?

54:57.700 --> 54:59.700
No, sir, the line is down.

55:01.967 --> 55:03.233
I think it's time.

55:03.400 --> 55:07.800
With all due respect, sir, a surrender here
will tarnish our reputation across Asia.

55:08.300 --> 55:11.467
Yes, and so would a civilian
massacre if we continue to resist.

55:11.600 --> 55:13.291
Sir, the Japanese cannot be trusted,

55:13.333 --> 55:17.367
think of Nanking, 300,000 dead.

55:17.700 --> 55:20.476
With the city's water supply shut
off, we are already at the Japs mercy.

55:20.500 --> 55:21.500
Please, sir.

55:21.800 --> 55:22.800
The men can fight on.

55:22.900 --> 55:24.200
One final fight.

55:24.367 --> 55:28.800
Make them pay a bloody toll for
every street, every building in the city.

55:30.066 --> 55:34.333
The civilian population would be
caught up in the crossfire, thousands dead.

55:37.967 --> 55:41.800
Being taken prisoner by the Japanese
would be worse than death, sir.

55:44.033 --> 55:45.767
They will break us,

55:47.100 --> 55:49.033
and they will butcher us,

55:49.600 --> 55:51.233
one by one.

55:52.133 --> 55:54.333
It will test our resolve, no doubt.

55:54.800 --> 55:57.900
But to save this city, that's a sacrifice
we're going to have to make.

55:58.233 --> 56:00.567
Our men have paid a heavier price.

56:03.100 --> 56:04.834
And your legacy, sir?

56:05.700 --> 56:07.433
How will you be remembered?

56:08.800 --> 56:10.567
Good night, gentlemen.

56:26.400 --> 56:31.033
16 pipes, Mr. Chow.

56:31.734 --> 56:33.800
Do you still desire another?

56:34.200 --> 56:37.500
What is my devilish reward if I continue?

56:37.800 --> 56:41.033
You already spent a
small fortune, Mr. Chow.

56:41.600 --> 56:44.600
Do you still have enough
silver coin for the evening?

56:45.934 --> 56:47.467
Is that enough for you?

56:47.633 --> 56:50.700
For for a pipe, yes, for a pipe.

56:52.600 --> 56:55.734
I want the special treatment.

56:56.233 --> 56:59.767
The aroma of companionship.

57:04.300 --> 57:07.600
Have you heard of riding the purple mist?

57:10.500 --> 57:16.133
Do my handful of silver allow me
entrance into this enchanted land?

57:42.300 --> 57:44.667
Are you seeing colors, Mr. Chow?

57:46.433 --> 57:51.033
Many colors, more than
the shades of any rainbow.

57:55.066 --> 57:56.867
Mr Chow

57:57.500 --> 57:59.400
Long time no see.

57:59.700 --> 58:02.333
What game are you playing this evening?

58:02.800 --> 58:03.967
It's...

58:04.900 --> 58:10.033
Riding mists, purple
clouds, and double rainbows.

58:10.233 --> 58:11.533
Something like that.

58:11.867 --> 58:13.433
I have heard of that one.

58:13.633 --> 58:16.834
Very, very decadent of you, Mr. Chow.

58:17.800 --> 58:21.100
With the world collapsing, why not?

58:21.433 --> 58:23.800
Hmm, I see. Well then...

58:23.967 --> 58:26.800
Let me suggest you a very special delight.

58:26.967 --> 58:30.333
Something not normally
permitted inside this club.

58:30.967 --> 58:32.166
Oh, really?

58:33.500 --> 58:37.100
Yes, an extension on an ongoing theme.

58:37.600 --> 58:41.967
A double delicacy, riding two purple mists.

58:43.800 --> 58:46.200
I will be in heaven then.

58:47.767 --> 58:52.367
Yes, you will be receiving the
sweet taste of heaven tonight.

59:46.033 --> 59:48.800
Your tea is ready.

59:51.200 --> 59:53.667
Mr. Chow, drink it.

1:00:15.767 --> 1:00:18.200
Maybe best if you get dressed and leave.

1:00:40.100 --> 1:00:43.233
Addiction can be deadly, Mr. Chow.

1:00:44.800 --> 1:00:47.367
Maybe you picked the wrong side.

1:01:00.433 --> 1:01:03.266
Sir, we've lost all
contact with Mount Davis.

1:01:03.900 --> 1:01:06.400
What about the Winnipeg
Grenadiers in Wan Chai gap?

1:01:06.767 --> 1:01:08.500
Those communication lines are also down.

1:01:08.734 --> 1:01:09.991
Can we send a messenger?

1:01:10.033 --> 1:01:12.567
Sir, the Japanese are
only a thousand yards away.

1:01:12.900 --> 1:01:15.400
It's unlikely we will reach
anyone outside our sector, sir.

1:01:16.200 --> 1:01:17.900
Any word from Governor Young?

1:01:18.100 --> 1:01:20.158
He wants us to continue
fighting, no surrender.

1:01:20.200 --> 1:01:21.467
Good man, Young.

1:01:21.633 --> 1:01:22.967
Finally, some sense!

1:01:23.166 --> 1:01:25.266
We can't give them Christmas boys.

1:01:25.700 --> 1:01:30.166
Gents, the Hong Kong Fortress was supposed
to hold out for at least three months.

1:01:30.500 --> 1:01:31.767
At least that was the plan.

1:01:31.934 --> 1:01:37.100
Churchill did realize this outpost
was just that, an outpost.

1:01:37.467 --> 1:01:40.200
They knew full well in London
we were destined to fail.

1:01:40.567 --> 1:01:44.400
Yes, well, here we are
at the edge, still fighting.

1:01:44.900 --> 1:01:47.266
But for how long?

1:01:50.100 --> 1:01:51.300
George

1:01:51.800 --> 1:01:55.734
I'd like to have a word with all the men
and women stationed here in the Battlebox.

1:01:56.300 --> 1:01:58.300
Go and gather everyone into the room.

1:02:02.033 --> 1:02:03.133
Yes, sir.

1:02:18.734 --> 1:02:19.734
What happened?

1:02:19.834 --> 1:02:24.066
I don't know. 20-30 pipes maybe.
A rich man with too much opium.

1:02:26.166 --> 1:02:27.800
His heart has stopped.

1:02:28.200 --> 1:02:30.467
He was turning purple, then collapsed.

1:02:30.834 --> 1:02:32.567
We need to put a lid on this.

1:02:32.967 --> 1:02:36.667
Blame it on heart attack,
natural cause, less fuss.

1:02:37.033 --> 1:02:38.967
Yes, that's probably the best.

1:02:39.533 --> 1:02:41.800
Okay, okay, God damn it.

1:02:42.300 --> 1:02:44.967
Such a rich man, we
could have made a fortune,

1:02:45.400 --> 1:02:47.500
had he stayed alive a few more years.

1:02:47.900 --> 1:02:49.066
What are tragedy.

1:02:49.233 --> 1:02:50.633
A big loss all around.

1:02:51.400 --> 1:02:55.367
I have to now go file a police report
and someone has informed his daughter.

1:02:56.300 --> 1:02:57.800
His daughter?

1:02:58.066 --> 1:03:00.033
Yes, poor girl.

1:03:00.200 --> 1:03:03.467
She lost her mother a
few years ago and now this.

1:03:03.900 --> 1:03:05.066
Do you like kids?

1:03:05.400 --> 1:03:06.467
Yeah.

1:03:06.900 --> 1:03:09.567
Maybe you can go, you
know, see the daughter.

1:03:10.200 --> 1:03:11.433
I don't know.

1:03:11.600 --> 1:03:13.400
I just... don't know.

1:03:14.200 --> 1:03:17.367
What a God damn mess.

1:04:11.300 --> 1:04:15.800
Sir, the ladies and gentlemen
of your General Staff are present, sir.

1:04:17.900 --> 1:04:20.100
For 17 long days,

1:04:20.600 --> 1:04:24.867
we've done our best to defend this
small outpost of the British Empire.

1:04:25.600 --> 1:04:28.400
I have no idea how history will judge us.

1:04:29.200 --> 1:04:34.600
For 100 years, British Hong Kong has been a
successful trading post on the far end of Asia.

1:04:35.100 --> 1:04:38.400
For years, it's been known
as the Eastern Fortress.

1:04:38.567 --> 1:04:41.700
A rock of fortitude in a troubled region.

1:04:42.633 --> 1:04:44.033
We all know,

1:04:44.300 --> 1:04:46.333
that war is a nasty business.

1:04:46.800 --> 1:04:49.834
We've lost many good
men during this battle.

1:04:50.400 --> 1:04:52.066
May God rest their souls.

1:04:52.600 --> 1:04:55.266
Their sacrifice must never be forgotten.

1:04:55.600 --> 1:04:59.600
They have fought with
determination, with bravery,

1:04:59.934 --> 1:05:01.900
with a united front.

1:05:02.734 --> 1:05:05.767
No British general could
have hoped for more.

1:05:06.867 --> 1:05:10.967
Well, now we're at a crossroads
and difficult decisions lie ahead.

1:05:11.867 --> 1:05:15.867
I know, that many may disagree
with what I have to say next.

1:05:16.734 --> 1:05:19.367
But please bear with
me in this desperate hour.

1:05:20.667 --> 1:05:25.700
I have decided that we shall offer
our surrender to the Japanese forces.

1:05:26.533 --> 1:05:28.300
It's a God awful choice.

1:05:28.867 --> 1:05:31.834
But as commander of the
British forces here in Hong Kong.

1:05:32.001 --> 1:05:33.558
I have come to the conclusion,

1:05:33.600 --> 1:05:35.433
that it's only right decision,

1:05:35.600 --> 1:05:37.266
for the future of the city,

1:05:37.433 --> 1:05:39.066
for its people,

1:05:39.233 --> 1:05:41.133
and for our exhausted soldiers

1:05:41.300 --> 1:05:43.900
who are run out of supplies and ammunition

1:05:44.100 --> 1:05:46.233
to carry on the fight.

1:05:46.700 --> 1:05:47.834
And so...

1:05:48.200 --> 1:05:51.200
My last mission today will
be to meet Governor Young,

1:05:51.367 --> 1:05:54.600
to provide a full assessment
of our grim situation.

1:05:55.667 --> 1:06:01.001
If he agrees that coming to terms with
the Japanese as our only viable option.

1:06:01.700 --> 1:06:05.767
Then our formal surrender will probably
take place later this afternoon.

1:06:07.567 --> 1:06:08.734
Well...

1:06:09.300 --> 1:06:12.100
Thank you all for your steadfast service.

1:06:13.500 --> 1:06:17.367
I stand before you now,
defeated but resolute.

1:06:18.200 --> 1:06:21.667
No British general can ever
prepare for a day like this.

1:06:22.934 --> 1:06:23.967
But...

1:06:24.300 --> 1:06:25.433
remember,

1:06:25.700 --> 1:06:27.967
no Empire lasts forever.

1:06:28.500 --> 1:06:30.467
We might have lost the battle,

1:06:30.700 --> 1:06:33.066
but we have not lost the war.

1:06:33.233 --> 1:06:35.633
And with America's
recent entry into the conflict,

1:06:35.800 --> 1:06:40.166
I believe, the tide of War will change.

1:06:40.500 --> 1:06:43.166
And with grit and determination,

1:06:43.934 --> 1:06:47.066
our future destiny is yet to be written.

1:06:47.600 --> 1:06:51.633
Hong Kong will be reborn again.

1:06:53.100 --> 1:06:55.433
Well, take care.

1:06:56.533 --> 1:06:57.567
And...

1:06:58.100 --> 1:07:01.734
May God save the King.

1:07:31.400 --> 1:07:32.800
Ahh...

1:07:43.266 --> 1:07:44.967
Help!

1:07:47.200 --> 1:07:48.367
You okay?

1:07:48.533 --> 1:07:50.100
Do you have water?

1:07:50.800 --> 1:07:51.800
Yeah.

1:07:52.133 --> 1:07:53.934
Yes, of course.

1:08:04.133 --> 1:08:05.500
What's going on out there?

1:08:05.667 --> 1:08:08.033
The British surrendered today.
- What?

1:08:08.300 --> 1:08:09.467
What day is it?

1:08:09.800 --> 1:08:11.433
25th of December.

1:08:11.600 --> 1:08:13.200
That's the British Christmas Day.

1:08:13.567 --> 1:08:15.433
That's a weird day to surrender.

1:08:15.967 --> 1:08:19.700
Yeah, actually, I'm looking
for a village called Shek O.

1:08:19.900 --> 1:08:21.001
Do you know of it?

1:08:21.166 --> 1:08:23.133
It's up that way.

1:08:23.500 --> 1:08:24.525
Thank you for the water.

1:08:24.567 --> 1:08:25.425
Oh, no, no, no...

1:08:25.467 --> 1:08:28.133
Keep it, there is food
inside. You will need it.

1:08:28.300 --> 1:08:30.100
Thank you so much.

1:08:57.100 --> 1:08:59.333
Nina, give us the room, please.

1:09:07.400 --> 1:09:09.433
You have some explaining to do, Charles.

1:09:10.100 --> 1:09:13.900
Our agent, Mr. Chow is dead.

1:09:16.633 --> 1:09:18.500
Good God.

1:09:20.133 --> 1:09:22.233
Assassinated?

1:09:24.867 --> 1:09:27.066
Look familiar?

1:09:32.433 --> 1:09:33.934
Poisoned...

1:09:34.166 --> 1:09:37.400
You tell me, that is
your handwriting, isn't it?

1:09:39.700 --> 1:09:42.467
Yes, that's my note.

1:09:44.233 --> 1:09:46.767
This poison was to be given to Mr. Chow.

1:09:47.200 --> 1:09:49.967
He was to use it on an operation
against some fifith-columnists.

1:09:50.500 --> 1:09:52.133
For fucks sake, Charles.

1:09:52.533 --> 1:09:56.367
Do they let just anyone in the
Intelligence Corps these days?

1:09:59.100 --> 1:10:02.100
Someone has to hang for this
and you better hope it's not you!

1:10:03.200 --> 1:10:05.367
I gave this poison to Mei Fong.

1:10:05.767 --> 1:10:06.767
Mei Fong?

1:10:06.800 --> 1:10:09.400
She was to deliver it to her
sister who knows Mr. Chow.

1:10:09.867 --> 1:10:11.700
The instructions were very clear.

1:10:11.867 --> 1:10:13.658
The poison was to be handed to Mr. Chow.

1:10:13.700 --> 1:10:15.400
Why would Mei Fong get this job?

1:10:15.567 --> 1:10:18.934
Because our soldiers are either
dead, injured or fighting the Japs!

1:10:19.300 --> 1:10:22.266
I can't spare men running
deliveries around this city.

1:10:22.433 --> 1:10:24.467
Jesus!

1:10:27.533 --> 1:10:30.567
You've lost your touch, Charles.

1:10:32.500 --> 1:10:33.834
So...

1:10:34.633 --> 1:10:36.600
Was she a Japanese spy?

1:10:36.767 --> 1:10:38.133
I don't...

1:10:38.800 --> 1:10:41.900
I don't know what to believe anymore.

1:10:44.200 --> 1:10:47.033
He was our man, Charles.

1:10:47.800 --> 1:10:50.633
He'd infiltrated Japanese High Command.

1:10:50.934 --> 1:10:57.200
He was going to keep funneling information
to London while we rot away in some POW Camp.

1:10:59.500 --> 1:11:01.567
Years of work, Charles.

1:11:01.734 --> 1:11:02.834
Years!!!

1:11:03.100 --> 1:11:05.567
Down the fucking drain!

1:11:08.600 --> 1:11:10.700
Well, I hope you're proud of yourself.

1:11:11.200 --> 1:11:13.266
You absolute,

1:11:13.800 --> 1:11:16.467
fucking imbecile!

1:12:31.734 --> 1:12:33.200
I...

1:12:34.500 --> 1:12:36.333
I am sorry.

1:12:48.800 --> 1:12:50.700
This is Charles Fisher at the Battlebox.

1:12:50.867 --> 1:12:52.600
I am calling to check on his daughter.

1:12:52.800 --> 1:12:54.967
Make sure someone is looking after her.

1:12:55.734 --> 1:12:57.200
Is she alright?

1:12:57.734 --> 1:12:58.767
Yes.

1:12:59.133 --> 1:13:00.567
She is.

1:13:01.100 --> 1:13:03.325
I'm sure the news of his
death was a big shock.

1:13:03.367 --> 1:13:04.867
It certainly was for us here.

1:13:05.033 --> 1:13:07.800
Probably killed by a fifth-columnist.

1:13:09.633 --> 1:13:13.200
If there's anything she needs,
anything at all, please let know.

1:13:13.967 --> 1:13:16.333
Of course. Yeah.

1:13:16.867 --> 1:13:18.333
Yeah...
