WEBVTT

00:30.120 --> 00:31.400
Dr. Heim!

00:35.640 --> 00:36.640
Dr. Heim!

00:40.840 --> 00:41.840
Heim. Hold still.

00:43.360 --> 00:44.200
Come on.

00:44.920 --> 00:48.280
-Come on.
-I can't. I don't have air.

00:49.720 --> 00:52.400
I've seen it too many times.
Leave me here.

00:52.480 --> 00:55.040
-I can't breathe.
-I'll get you out of here.

00:55.120 --> 00:58.280
The end is near. Just leave me here.

00:59.760 --> 01:01.240
I'll get you out of here.

01:01.320 --> 01:02.160
No.

01:02.920 --> 01:04.360
Just leave me here.

01:07.680 --> 01:08.520
Bachmann.

01:27.680 --> 01:28.720
Bachmann.

01:46.720 --> 01:48.840
Someone help us!

01:49.360 --> 01:51.000
He can't breathe.

01:57.680 --> 01:59.680
He wants me to tell you
it's a pneumothorax

01:59.760 --> 02:01.960
from a rib fracture
in the middle lobe of the left lung.

02:02.040 --> 02:04.760
He's not ventilating.
We'll take him to the operating room.

02:05.600 --> 02:09.920
-You can't go with him. You need help too.
-He has to leave the operating room alive.

02:11.840 --> 02:13.080
He's in critical condition.

02:13.160 --> 02:15.160
That's why you're going to save his life.

02:23.440 --> 02:25.560
-Hello?
-Don't say my name.

02:25.640 --> 02:26.680
Where are you?

02:26.760 --> 02:29.560
The thing we didn't want to happen
happened. Understood?

02:29.640 --> 02:30.480
Yes.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.760
Listen. Stay calm
and do what we talked about.

02:33.840 --> 02:36.680
Get the passports
and go to the place I told you.

02:36.760 --> 02:37.600
And then?

02:38.320 --> 02:39.800
Repeat it to me.

02:41.440 --> 02:44.520
I'll get the passports
and meet you where we said.

02:44.600 --> 02:47.520
Go now. I'll be there as soon as I can.

02:48.080 --> 02:49.200
Will I see you again?

02:49.720 --> 02:50.760
Of course.

02:51.360 --> 02:54.480
It's okay.
I love you very much, and you know it.

02:54.560 --> 02:57.760
And we'll be together very soon.
I promise. Trust me.

02:59.280 --> 03:02.080
Honey, no one's going to beat us.

04:24.280 --> 04:25.480
-Isabel.
-Hm?

04:25.560 --> 04:26.680
Are you okay?

04:27.920 --> 04:28.840
What happened?

04:29.400 --> 04:31.320
We had an accident on the boat.

04:34.320 --> 04:35.320
Bachmann?

04:35.840 --> 04:38.920
We don't know where he or Heim is.
We're still trying to find out.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.040
Uh-huh.

04:53.960 --> 04:56.120
Good morning,
I'm looking for some relatives

04:56.200 --> 04:57.880
who may have had a boating accident.

05:02.720 --> 05:04.280
Okay, thank you very much.

05:13.320 --> 05:17.720
Nothing. Bachmann's wife's also gone.
They must have warned her.

05:17.800 --> 05:20.080
Well, it's the only thing
we have to get Heim.

05:20.160 --> 05:21.920
That rat always lands on his feet.

05:22.520 --> 05:23.360
What?

05:24.800 --> 05:25.880
Yes? This morning?

05:26.880 --> 05:29.040
Thank you very much.
I really appreciate it.

05:33.400 --> 05:36.680
Comrades, I called
the two hospitals in Almería.

05:36.760 --> 05:40.160
Hospital del Niño Dios said that
two tourists were admitted there.

05:40.240 --> 05:43.160
One was in critical condition
and taken directly into surgery.

05:43.240 --> 05:44.400
Doesn't mean it's them.

05:46.160 --> 05:47.640
Sailing accident this morning?

05:50.080 --> 05:51.120
There we go.

05:52.160 --> 05:53.960
That's what I said. It's them.

06:22.120 --> 06:23.120
A NETFLIX SERIES

07:39.000 --> 07:40.160
Doctor!

07:40.240 --> 07:42.680
He's lost a lot of blood,
and he's very weak.

07:42.760 --> 07:45.840
But if he rests for a few days
and there are no infections,

07:46.680 --> 07:48.680
he'll be discharged in two weeks.

07:48.760 --> 07:51.200
He can't stay here.
We have to leave today.

07:51.280 --> 07:52.880
He's in no condition to go.

07:56.240 --> 07:57.880
I am taking him with me.

07:58.880 --> 08:00.840
Give me antibiotics and morphine.

08:00.920 --> 08:02.000
I can't do that.

08:02.600 --> 08:04.240
Not while he's my responsibility.

08:04.840 --> 08:06.840
He needs more blood. And more rest.

08:07.360 --> 08:10.400
You should at least wait a few hours.
If you move him now you'll be killing him.

08:10.480 --> 08:12.320
Any other wounded patients today?

08:12.400 --> 08:15.160
You're in a hospital. What do you think?

08:21.720 --> 08:24.080
-Yeah?
-Don't say my name.

08:24.160 --> 08:27.800
The line isn't secure. Grab this morning's
paper, the one Almansa always reads.

08:27.880 --> 08:30.200
Open it to the page of your locker number.

08:30.840 --> 08:32.920
You see the column on the right?

08:33.000 --> 08:35.600
The last word of the headline. Got it?

08:35.680 --> 08:36.680
Got it.

08:36.760 --> 08:38.240
That's gonna be the city.

08:39.000 --> 08:39.840
Next page.

08:39.920 --> 08:43.040
Seventh word of the headline
in the right-hand column.

08:43.560 --> 08:46.000
Seventh word of the lead story.

08:46.080 --> 08:47.920
Now go back to the even-numbered page.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.640
The prayer. There you have it.

08:51.560 --> 08:53.280
I need you to protect someone.

08:53.360 --> 08:54.600
Can I count on you?

08:55.520 --> 08:57.040
Of course, you bastard.

08:59.360 --> 09:00.800
I said no names.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.600
All clear, right?
No hesitations inside.

09:17.160 --> 09:18.320
Now, let's go get Heim

09:18.400 --> 09:20.640
and send that motherfucker
back to France one and for all.

09:49.400 --> 09:51.120
Third floor, room 52.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.000
Mmm.

10:16.800 --> 10:17.760
We got him.

10:26.520 --> 10:27.640
FIRST FLOOR

10:40.000 --> 10:41.080
THIRD FLOOR

10:56.280 --> 10:57.320
EXIT

11:23.400 --> 11:24.560
What the fuck?

11:30.200 --> 11:31.120
Fuck.

11:33.320 --> 11:34.240
It's a trap.

11:38.920 --> 11:40.880
-Let's go.
-We gotta move.

11:47.320 --> 11:48.360
Come on.

11:50.680 --> 11:52.560
Make sure every door is guarded.

11:54.160 --> 11:55.000
Isabel, let's go.

12:41.040 --> 12:41.880
It's clear.

12:41.960 --> 12:43.440
Let's go in there.

12:47.520 --> 12:51.520
I want you to order half your forces
to guard all exterior access points.

12:51.600 --> 12:52.480
Order the other half

12:52.560 --> 12:54.840
-to sweep and secure the second floor.
-Yes, sir.

12:54.920 --> 12:59.560
I want at least five soldiers assigned
to guard Mr. Heim's room at all times.

13:00.760 --> 13:02.000
Choose your best.

13:02.680 --> 13:04.640
We'll make arrangements to get him out.

13:06.560 --> 13:09.120
As you know, this is a special situation.

13:09.200 --> 13:12.200
From now on, you'll inform me
of each patient who's admitted,

13:12.280 --> 13:16.560
and most importantly, tell me if anyone
asks about me or my partner.

13:17.320 --> 13:19.800
-I think they already did, sir.
-Who? When?

13:23.720 --> 13:26.400
-Ten minutes ago. A woman.
-Describe her.

13:26.480 --> 13:30.560
In her thirties, slim, pretty,
brunette, green eyes.

13:31.160 --> 13:32.160
They're inside.

13:32.960 --> 13:35.960
Reinforce the watch on all access points,
but from the outside.

13:36.040 --> 13:39.520
I don't want them leaving here alive.
And get yourself another pistol.

13:40.360 --> 13:42.000
What's wrong with this one, sir?

13:42.880 --> 13:43.800
It's mine now.

14:51.360 --> 14:54.160
Secure the perimeter,
no one in and out.

15:11.760 --> 15:13.800
Secure the perimeter,
no one in or out.

15:49.120 --> 15:51.480
Castro… is this what you saw?

15:52.240 --> 15:53.280
Ah…

15:54.960 --> 15:55.960
Yeah, that's it.

15:56.480 --> 15:57.560
In the south wing.

15:58.240 --> 16:01.480
-That's where the soldiers are organizing.
-You sure it's there?

16:03.880 --> 16:05.120
Every single room is guarded.

16:05.200 --> 16:07.840
-How many soldiers?
-A lot. We're surrounded.

16:07.920 --> 16:11.680
There's 20 guards just in this wing.
Bachmann has to be close.

16:11.760 --> 16:13.200
So what options do we have?

16:19.800 --> 16:21.280
Not many.

16:25.800 --> 16:26.640
If that.

16:32.560 --> 16:33.760
Then what do we do?

16:36.560 --> 16:38.560
Smoke.

16:40.480 --> 16:43.920
Bachmann will sacrifice
his own life for him if necessary.

16:46.480 --> 16:47.960
I know how I want to die.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.920
But you need to decide for yourselves.

17:01.120 --> 17:02.360
I won't drag you down with me.

17:04.720 --> 17:07.760
Just know, I'm getting out of here
with Heim or not at all.

17:17.320 --> 17:18.920
You have a few minutes to think it over.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.760
I'll understand completely
if anyone wants to back out.

17:58.400 --> 18:00.520
This might be the last cigarette we smoke.

18:04.800 --> 18:06.760
Remember when you came looking for me?

18:08.320 --> 18:10.880
I could barely read
the letter my father gave you.

18:11.920 --> 18:13.080
Fuck me.

18:14.040 --> 18:17.400
On the same day I found out
my father had died,

18:17.480 --> 18:19.600
I also find out I have an older brother.

18:27.160 --> 18:28.480
I won't let them kill you.

18:29.560 --> 18:31.400
We're gonna get out of here.

18:32.440 --> 18:34.240
And then we're gonna get drunk.

18:40.240 --> 18:44.680
Do you remember that bar in Paris?
The one where that "Toulouse" lady was?

18:45.360 --> 18:48.080
What was that?
The way shed always say "cigarette"?

18:48.640 --> 18:50.880
"Sigaah."

18:51.480 --> 18:55.440
Without the R.
We had a great time, didn't we?

19:32.240 --> 19:33.320
Mm.

19:44.560 --> 19:46.080
He was a good man.

19:54.160 --> 19:56.400
There he is around the same age I am now.

19:59.080 --> 20:00.360
It's weird.

20:03.960 --> 20:05.760
I've almost outlived him.

20:13.640 --> 20:15.480
Where'd you keep this picture?

20:19.320 --> 20:21.200
There's no one left alive.

20:23.040 --> 20:24.040
No one.

20:24.640 --> 20:25.760
Deaf Man, I know.

20:26.840 --> 20:28.840
You told me when you came to my house.

20:28.920 --> 20:31.000
You have tattoos of all of their names.

20:32.200 --> 20:35.120
What I don't get is
why you never showed this to me before.

20:37.800 --> 20:40.080
Because I didn't want to remember it.

20:43.880 --> 20:45.040
Why?

20:48.720 --> 20:49.720
I did it.

20:51.640 --> 20:52.520
Did what?

20:54.600 --> 20:56.520
It was my fault.

21:04.600 --> 21:05.760
I was a kapo.

21:08.280 --> 21:11.160
What the hell are you talking about?
Deaf Man?

21:12.320 --> 21:13.320
Deaf Man…

21:19.320 --> 21:20.640
Don't fuck with me.

21:36.880 --> 21:37.920
Tell me it's a lie.

21:40.760 --> 21:41.840
Deaf Man…

21:42.360 --> 21:45.240
tell me it wasn't some other prisoners
who cut out your tongue?

22:09.960 --> 22:11.320
You left him alone.

22:16.040 --> 22:18.320
Tell me why I shouldn't
kill you right now.

22:31.560 --> 22:33.000
I'll never forgive you.

22:43.720 --> 22:44.560
You decide?

22:45.680 --> 22:47.240
I stand by my comrades.

22:50.800 --> 22:51.720
So do I.

23:03.320 --> 23:04.320
So do I.

23:16.120 --> 23:17.480
Time to atone.

23:19.640 --> 23:22.600
All right. Let's split them up.

23:25.040 --> 23:27.360
We're going to place decoys
all over the hospital.

23:28.680 --> 23:31.800
We need to make them think we're trying to
catch them off guard by diverting them.

23:34.640 --> 23:38.080
It's not gonna work.
Bachmann won't buy it.

23:38.920 --> 23:42.280
No, of course not.
That's what we want, for it not to work.

23:43.040 --> 23:45.160
We're going to need
something really powerful.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.600
How powerful?

23:47.680 --> 23:50.160
Something
that makes a lot of noise.

23:51.120 --> 23:53.160
They'll think it's Fallas time.

23:55.240 --> 23:58.280
If we want to get out of here
with Heim, we need a car ready.

23:58.360 --> 23:59.240
Perfect.

24:00.400 --> 24:01.800
What about us?

24:02.480 --> 24:04.520
We'll set the bonfires
of Saint John's Eve.

24:17.560 --> 24:18.680
BOILER ROOM

24:18.760 --> 24:20.200
MAIN STOPCOCK VALVE

24:26.080 --> 24:26.920
HIGH VOLTAGE

24:29.840 --> 24:32.360
-What happened?
-The fire alarm went off in a restroom.

24:32.440 --> 24:34.240
The electricity and water
had been turned off.

24:34.320 --> 24:36.240
We checked the boilers
and the maintenance room.

24:36.320 --> 24:38.560
And there was no one in any of them.

24:38.640 --> 24:40.320
-Am I wrong?
-No, sir.

24:41.920 --> 24:43.400
They want to split us up.

24:44.880 --> 24:47.320
Gather all your troops on this floor.

24:47.400 --> 24:49.600
We're not going to do
what they expect us to do.

24:49.680 --> 24:51.800
-But that's risky, sir.
-That's an order!

24:53.360 --> 24:55.960
General retreat
to the south wing, second floor.

24:56.040 --> 24:59.200
I repeat, general retreat
to the south wing, second floor.

25:23.400 --> 25:24.960
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT

25:34.520 --> 25:38.040
And when they least expect it,
that's when we go in.

25:39.480 --> 25:41.360
They will never see the twist coming.

26:35.840 --> 26:37.240
No, it's a trap!

27:03.920 --> 27:04.920
Let's go.

28:37.320 --> 28:38.200
Otto!

28:39.840 --> 28:41.520
It's your friend Vicente. Remember me?

28:42.600 --> 28:44.960
I have nothing to say to you!

28:47.480 --> 28:49.440
Don't be angry, Otto. We just want Heim.

28:50.400 --> 28:53.680
-You don't understand, do you?
-There's nothing to understand!

28:58.920 --> 29:00.280
To you, I'm a Nazi.

29:00.360 --> 29:03.240
A disgusting animal
without principles, right?

29:03.320 --> 29:06.000
-How could I be loyal?
-You know he's dying.

29:06.080 --> 29:09.160
Heim is dying. Are you really
going to sacrifice yourself for him?

29:10.120 --> 29:12.120
You'd do the same
for your people.

29:18.720 --> 29:20.880
Don't compare us, Otto.
We're not the same.

29:26.720 --> 29:29.800
Otto! You earned a medal
for saving Mussolini,

29:29.880 --> 29:32.880
but you just happened to be first
to show up and take a picture with him.

29:33.960 --> 29:35.520
You love the attention.

29:35.600 --> 29:38.560
But you're just the idiot they
call to clean up other people's messes.

29:54.680 --> 29:56.240
-Shit.
-Move.

29:56.320 --> 29:57.520
-Why?
-Just get back.

29:58.880 --> 30:00.600
Bachmann, do you know who this is?

30:05.240 --> 30:06.480
Don't you remember me?

30:06.560 --> 30:08.000
A very pretty corpse!

30:11.920 --> 30:15.000
Maybe, but not until
I kill the man who murdered my father.

30:17.400 --> 30:19.720
For 15 years,
I've been waiting for this moment.

30:26.800 --> 30:28.360
And now it's your turn to die!

30:37.120 --> 30:38.720
It's nothing. I'm fine.

30:40.040 --> 30:41.080
Castro! Castro!

30:46.800 --> 30:48.760
Shit!

30:49.400 --> 30:50.960
-Aaah!
-No!

31:47.960 --> 31:49.880
Lucena!

33:09.160 --> 33:10.200
I'm going in.

33:10.720 --> 33:12.080
No. Alone.

34:02.400 --> 34:03.520
It's over.

34:07.920 --> 34:09.280
Put the gun down.

34:10.600 --> 34:12.040
I said put the gun down!

34:13.560 --> 34:16.880
You better hope you can shoot me
before I blow this fucker's head off.

34:18.240 --> 34:20.920
-He won't shoot me.
-You sure?

34:45.880 --> 34:46.960
Get Heim!

34:55.080 --> 34:57.600
Come on! Let's go!

35:02.920 --> 35:04.800
Come on! Move!

35:29.880 --> 35:31.040
Which way?

35:31.120 --> 35:32.240
The stairs!

35:32.840 --> 35:34.000
Come on!

36:25.360 --> 36:26.200
Stop!

36:36.720 --> 36:38.200
Come on, let's go. Move it!

36:38.800 --> 36:39.640
Hurry!

37:56.600 --> 37:57.680
They have Heim.

37:58.600 --> 37:59.520
I want him alive.

38:01.440 --> 38:04.000
They have the hostage.
Hold your fire.

38:12.280 --> 38:13.120
Damn it.

38:20.440 --> 38:24.760
Castro, Deaf Mean, stay with Heim.
Isabel, Marsé, cover us. Let's move.

38:27.560 --> 38:29.280
Come on. Let's go.

38:29.840 --> 38:31.520
Don't shoot, they have Heim.

38:32.160 --> 38:33.160
Clear.

38:35.480 --> 38:37.400
Move it, move it. Go, go, go.

38:38.400 --> 38:39.520
Get inside.

38:46.520 --> 38:47.560
We're clear.

39:37.200 --> 39:38.880
There has to be. There has to be a way.

39:45.440 --> 39:47.600
We could have chosen
another place to hide.

39:47.680 --> 39:48.920
Maybe it's a sign.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.320
Huh. From who?

39:55.800 --> 39:59.200
I wanted to die sitting on the porch
of my grandfather's house in Valencia.

39:59.280 --> 40:01.000
As an old man.

40:02.280 --> 40:03.520
What do we do?

40:04.600 --> 40:06.120
The hospital is surrounded.

40:06.200 --> 40:07.080
So what?

40:09.280 --> 40:10.720
We won't get out of here alive.

40:15.680 --> 40:18.960
What are you doing? Deaf Man!
Put that fucking thing down. Listen to me.

40:19.040 --> 40:19.960
Sh!

40:20.680 --> 40:23.000
Watch out.

40:34.280 --> 40:35.440
Deaf Man!

40:39.680 --> 40:41.040
-Don't move.
-Don't hurt me.

40:41.120 --> 40:42.480
Shut up. Hands up.

40:42.560 --> 40:43.760
Shhh!

40:44.400 --> 40:45.720
Shhh!

40:45.800 --> 40:46.880
Get up!

40:53.240 --> 40:54.760
There.

40:56.080 --> 40:57.600
Oh, fuck me.

41:04.760 --> 41:07.320
If we can't get out of here alive,
we'll have to leave dead.

41:13.480 --> 41:15.120
They tried to escape in an ambulance, sir.

41:15.200 --> 41:17.680
But they've retreated
and they're back in the hospital.

41:17.760 --> 41:19.320
-Where?
-We don't know yet, sir.

41:19.400 --> 41:21.360
We held our fire to protect your friend.

41:21.440 --> 41:23.440
Captain, do you read me?

41:23.960 --> 41:25.600
They're in the morgue.

43:15.880 --> 43:17.040
GROUND FLOOR

43:18.960 --> 43:20.000
Goodbye.

43:34.680 --> 43:35.760
Calm down.

43:37.240 --> 43:38.560
Don't shoot.

43:40.120 --> 43:40.960
Please.

43:53.680 --> 43:55.040
I won't do anything.

44:10.400 --> 44:11.520
Deaf Man.

44:26.200 --> 44:27.120
Miss!

44:28.720 --> 44:30.000
Step away from the gurney.

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
It's okay. It's okay.

44:37.600 --> 44:40.360
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

44:40.440 --> 44:42.880
No!

44:58.800 --> 45:00.640
Get in the car, Isabel. Let's go.

45:08.880 --> 45:11.280
-Freeze! Drop the gun!
-Stop!

45:21.440 --> 45:23.200
-Drop the gun!
-Isabel, go! Go!

45:23.280 --> 45:24.640
-Get in the car!
-Please go!

45:24.720 --> 45:25.880
-Isabel, go!
-Get in the car!

45:25.960 --> 45:28.240
-Drive, Isabel! Go! Go now!
-Stop right there!

45:28.720 --> 45:31.760
-Slowly! Freeze!
-Stop! Stop!

45:31.840 --> 45:33.120
-All right.
-Drop your gun!

45:43.880 --> 45:45.000
-Put the gun down!
-Stop!

45:45.080 --> 45:46.480
-I won't shoot.
-Don't move!

45:47.160 --> 45:48.400
-Putting it down!
-Down!

45:48.480 --> 45:50.920
-Down!
-It's okay, I'll put it down.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.280
All right, all right, all right!
All right!

45:54.280 --> 45:55.640
-Don't move!
-Okay.

46:17.560 --> 46:19.320
It's over.
