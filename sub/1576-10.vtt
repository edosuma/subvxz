sometimes it's your only option.

08:46.630 --> 08:49.297
You know what
a last resort looks like?

08:49.299 --> 08:52.300
Like a 33-year-old woman who
devoted herself to her career

08:52.302 --> 08:54.002
because she had nothing else
and then realized

08:54.004 --> 08:56.137
she's not even good at that
because she screwed up

08:56.139 --> 08:59.073
and gave a kid to two guys
pretending to be a gay couple.

08:59.075 --> 09:01.542
I was just named
employee of the month.

09:01.544 --> 09:03.945
Now I can't even use
my $25 Target gift card

09:03.947 --> 09:05.280

09:06.683 --> 09:09.317
You are a good employee
and a good person.

09:09.319 --> 09:12.353
And, if it'll help, I'll, uh,
I'll buy the gift card off you.

09:18.128 --> 09:20.094

09:20.096 --> 09:22.130
I put your Christmas card
on my fridge.

09:22.132 --> 09:23.765

who you are.

09:23.767 --> 09:25.400
Who are those people
on my fridge?!

09:25.402 --> 09:27.502
We're the same two people
that you trusted Louis with

09:27.504 --> 09:28.770
in the first place.

09:28.772 --> 09:30.104
This whole thing is
a nightmare.

09:30.106 --> 09:31.973

I could lose my job?

09:31.975 --> 09:34.542

09:34.544 --> 09:36.210

feel terrible

09:36.212 --> 09:37.912
that we put you
in this position.

09:37.914 --> 09:40.715

fault you for that.

know you're here?

18:07.876 --> 18:09.375
Berta, it's okay.

18:09.377 --> 18:11.277
And she's not
a real blonde.

18:14.315 --> 18:16.015
Come here.

18:16.017 --> 18:18.951
I want you to know that
this isn't your fault.

18:18.953 --> 18:23.089
You didn't do anything wrong
and you're a great kid.

18:23.091 --> 18:24.690
I really liked it here.

18:24.692 --> 18:27.827
We are, uh... we're
gonna miss you, kiddo.

18:27.829 --> 18:30.830
Me, too.

18:30.832 --> 18:32.398
Here.

18:32.400 --> 18:34.434
No.

18:34.436 --> 18:36.069
T-Timothy's your
best friend.

18:36.071 --> 18:38.204
He'll be your
best friend now.

18:38.206 --> 18:40.973
(sobs)

18:43.378 --> 18:44.944
Bye, Louis.

18:44.946 --> 18:46.813
Bye. Bye, Berta.

18:46.815 --> 18:48.381
So long, kid.

18:48.383 --> 18:49.816
Come on, Louis.

19:02.063 --> 19:04.530
I can't do this.

19:04.532 --> 19:05.498
What?

19:05.500 --> 19:07.533
No, the whole reason
I took this job

19:07.535 --> 19:08.734
was to help kids.

19:08.736 --> 19:11.537
No matter how
we got here,

19:11.539 --> 19:13.606
this is the best place for him.

19:13.608 --> 19:14.907
Oh, this is amazing.

19:14.909 --> 19:16.642
Come here, buddy. Oh!

19:16.644 --> 19:19.745
Did you grow while
you were gone?

19:19.747 --> 19:21.380
(laughs)
No.

19:21.382 --> 19:22.548
No?

19:22.550 --> 19:24.717
Get ready for
a mama bear hug.

19:24.719 --> 19:25.985
Mama bear.
(laughs)

19:25.987 --> 19:28.020
Oh, my goodness, thank you.

19:28.857 --> 19:30.089
No more lies.

19:30.091 --> 19:31.124
No.

19:31.126 --> 19:32.558
Unless my boss
finds out about this.

19:32.560 --> 19:33.926
Then I totally need you to lie.

19:35.463 --> 19:37.530
Glad to have
you back, kid.

19:37.532 --> 19:39.832
Oh, and, Ms. McMartin,

19:39.834 --> 19:41.601
you might want to stay
away from your house

19:41.603 --> 19:43.369
until I can make
some phone calls.

19:45.807 --> 19:47.406
Okay! Okay!

19:47.408 --> 19:48.741
Let's put your stuff
away, buddy.

19:48.743 --> 19:50.009
Hey, you know what?

19:50.011 --> 19:51.310
You can have this now,

19:51.312 --> 19:53.579
'cause I got
my best friend back.

19:53.581 --> 19:55.014
Technically, I'm
your best friend.

19:55.016 --> 19:55.982
(laughs)

19:55.984 --> 19:58.217
And I never left.

19:58.219 --> 19:59.685
Still, a touching moment.

20:01.022 --> 20:02.622
That was really sweet of you.

20:02.624 --> 20:04.457
I feel good about it.

20:04.459 --> 20:06.692
Today you earned
your Target gift card.

20:06.694 --> 20:07.960
(laughs)

20:07.962 --> 20:08.928
Thanks.

20:08.930 --> 20:10.429
No, thank you.

20:12.400 --> 20:13.766
(sniffles)

20:13.768 --> 20:15.535
Oh. Oh, are you...
are you crying?

20:15.537 --> 20:18.838
Yes, but... tears of joy.

20:25.547 --> 20:27.113
Those work, too.

20:27.115 --> 20:29.015
♪<i> Men.</i> ♪

20:34.533 --> 20:36.266
♪<i> Men.</i> ♪
Wow!

20:36.268 --> 20:37.734
That was amazing!

20:37.736 --> 20:38.702
Yep.

20:38.704 --> 20:40.537
Alan may disappoint
sometimes,

20:40.539 --> 20:43.006
but a little blue
pill never does.

20:43.008 --> 20:45.742
Hey, could I ask you
a personal question?

20:45.744 --> 20:47.711
What do you consider personal?

20:47.713 --> 20:50.380
I already let you try on
my work panties.

20:50.382 --> 20:53.450
Well... how do I put this?

20:53.452 --> 20:57.008
Ms. McMartin,
what's your first name?

20:59.184 --> 21:05.684
