00:01.020 --> 00:03.719
<i>- Previously on</i> Star...
- You married Angel?

00:03.800 --> 00:04.900
- Is this true?
- So she's not gay.

00:04.920 --> 00:05.926
- Are you kidding me?
- You need to stop.

00:05.950 --> 00:07.116
How long has this
been happening?

00:07.140 --> 00:09.790
- Since the showcase.
- I'm gonna get you a new therapist.

00:09.820 --> 00:10.896
<i>Did you sleep here?</i>

00:10.920 --> 00:12.390
Yeah. In the RV with Noah.

00:12.430 --> 00:14.220
Andy and Angel, you're
starting the tour

00:14.240 --> 00:16.430
- with Midtown's top song.
- Looks like we're winning.

00:16.460 --> 00:17.830
How are those two idiots on top?

00:17.870 --> 00:19.970
I fought for Sound House
to back this tour.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
I fought for you, Noah.

00:21.030 --> 00:23.160
But, ultimately, my company
sees you as a risk.

00:23.260 --> 00:25.316
The girls are hyped up about
landing an A-list promoter.

00:25.340 --> 00:27.236
They want to meet with the
talent to get a feel for 'em.

00:27.260 --> 00:29.040
<i>I don't care what
Sound House says.</i>

00:29.080 --> 00:31.119
Charles has got to be
impressed with this crowd.

00:31.120 --> 00:32.479
It was all your idea.

00:32.509 --> 00:34.826
I'm sorry, babe, we got about
one more hour before we open.

00:34.850 --> 00:36.280
I'm actually looking
for someone.

00:36.320 --> 00:38.150
My son's father, Arnold.

that I study. Troy Carter, Irving Azoff.
These people...

02:12.250 --> 02:15.350
The point is, you have been
lying to us the whole time.

02:15.380 --> 02:18.180
I haven't been lying to you. I'm
still in the internship program.

02:18.220 --> 02:19.220
I'm just switching my focus.

02:19.221 --> 02:20.920
I want to be a artist
and an executive.

02:20.950 --> 02:22.320
You can end up like Dr. Dre,

02:22.360 --> 02:24.690
you can end up like Jay-Z, you know.
All these people...

02:24.720 --> 02:27.030
I never understood why-why-why
they call him doctor.

02:27.060 --> 02:29.630
I mean, does he have a PhD?

02:29.660 --> 02:30.860
Are you serious?

02:30.900 --> 02:34.100
Sweetie, oh, we love you.
You know that.

02:34.130 --> 02:35.670
We want you to be happy, but...

02:35.700 --> 02:37.570
Well, then support
my decision, Mom.

02:37.600 --> 02:39.140
Oh, so, we-we're

02:39.170 --> 02:41.070
supposed to keep letting
you live at home,

02:41.110 --> 02:43.610
paying your car note, while you
chase the spotlight, right?

02:43.640 --> 02:45.110
That's not what we
paid for, Andy.

02:45.150 --> 02:46.960
What did you pay for?

02:48.520 --> 02:51.450
Just because you adopted
me when no one else would,

02:51.490 --> 02:52.850
I'm your puppet now?

02:52.890 --> 02:55.390
You are supposed to take it...
every advantage

02:55.420 --> 02:57.290
that we gave you, despite...

02:57.320 --> 02:58.620
Despite what?

02:59.630 --> 03:01.590
Being black?

03:01.630 --> 03:03.600
I didn't say that, Andy.

03:03.630 --> 03:06.300
You never actually say it.

03:07.040 --> 03:09.439
If you want to continue

03:09.440 --> 03:10.460
chasing your dream,

03:10.480 --> 03:13.240
we're gonna support you. Hmm?

03:13.270 --> 03:16.060
Just as long as you hang
on to the internship.

03:18.080 --> 03:21.280
You don't think I can
make it as an artist.

03:32.180 --> 03:34.410
- Yes, sir.
- Would you put the phone down

03:34.440 --> 03:36.020
so I can finish cutting
your hair, man?

03:36.080 --> 03:37.650
Baby, this is business.

03:37.680 --> 03:40.580
Charles Floyd is pissed that we
lost that deal with Sound House.

03:40.620 --> 03:43.690
Now, this regional tour better
bank in some real bread.

03:43.720 --> 03:45.850
Well, you said the promoter
can get us there, right?

03:45.890 --> 03:48.799
So Charles Floyd
can kiss my ass.

03:48.800 --> 03:50.940
Nobody should treat his
daughter the way he did.

03:51.020 --> 03:53.230
Well, Natalie will handle it.
We go way back.

03:53.260 --> 03:55.430
- Natalie?
- The regional promoter.

03:55.470 --> 03:56.470
Hey, hey, hey.

03:56.471 --> 03:59.330
Cassie is in the
building, honey.

03:59.370 --> 04:01.740
Ooh, well, behold
old classy Cassie.

04:01.770 --> 04:03.440
Mmm, mmm.

04:03.470 --> 04:04.956
Man, what's going on with
you and this new look?

04:04.980 --> 04:07.480
Well, I got me some new
business opportunities.

04:07.510 --> 04:09.520
Oh, Lord. Don't tell me nothing.

04:09.540 --> 04:11.496
I don't want to have to
testify against you in court.

04:11.520 --> 04:14.380
Hello to you, too, Lottie. Ooh.

04:14.420 --> 04:17.120
Does, uh, black
McDreamy got a name?

04:17.149 --> 04:18.390
Yeah, it's Maurice.

04:18.420 --> 04:20.519
And that's my man,
so back it up.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.560
Okay. Maurice.

04:22.590 --> 04:23.860
Mm-hmm.

04:24.540 --> 04:25.540
Why you cheesin'?

04:25.620 --> 04:27.319
- Yo, she's funny.
- Thank you.

04:27.320 --> 04:28.320
Mm-hmm.

04:28.330 --> 04:29.716
But she ain't got
nothing on you, boo.

04:29.740 --> 04:31.200
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

04:31.230 --> 04:32.230
Thanks for the lineup.

04:32.240 --> 04:33.940
- You're welcome.
- I got to go introduce

04:33.970 --> 04:35.940
- Natalie to the artists.
- Okay.

04:36.780 --> 04:38.400
Keep an eye on the girls
for me, will you?

04:38.420 --> 04:39.420
Yeah. I'm good?

04:39.440 --> 04:41.200
- Yeah, you're good, baby.
- All right, baby.

04:41.240 --> 04:43.079
- Okay.

04:56.260 --> 04:58.260
This is how you make
your love songs?

04:58.300 --> 04:59.556
With your shirt
unbuttoned like this.

04:59.580 --> 05:00.776
- Abs all out.
- Yes, yes. This is how I do it.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.140
All right? Trying to get it in.

05:02.200 --> 05:04.330
Got heat off of this
DJ Khaled record.

05:04.370 --> 05:05.370
I need to finish this album.

05:05.380 --> 05:06.940
I wrote, like, seven
songs last night.

05:06.970 --> 05:09.720
- That's so good.
- Yes, it is. Thank you.

05:09.760 --> 05:10.760
Now eat.

05:10.770 --> 05:12.670
You got me food? What?

05:14.280 --> 05:17.720
What's this? Oh, snap.

05:17.800 --> 05:18.800
Hold up, man.

05:18.820 --> 05:20.720
Let me post how good my bae is.

05:20.750 --> 05:22.680
Hold up. She's so sweet.

05:22.720 --> 05:24.350
Bae?

05:24.390 --> 05:27.790
- You don't like "bae"?
- No.

05:27.820 --> 05:30.260
You know Star ain't mad.
She's cool with us.

05:30.290 --> 05:33.090
Come on, tell me
what's going on.

05:34.300 --> 05:37.170
She's family. And...

05:37.200 --> 05:39.700
I've been making a lot
of mistakes lately.

05:39.740 --> 05:41.270
Wait, am I a mistake?

05:41.300 --> 05:43.046
- I didn't say that.
- It feels like it, though.

05:43.070 --> 05:45.040
- I'm happy, okay?
- Good.

05:45.080 --> 05:47.310
Give me some kisses
with your fine ass.

05:47.340 --> 05:48.840
Yeah.

05:48.880 --> 05:52.180
Bring it in. Mmm.

05:52.220 --> 05:54.050
Yo, you got to calm down, man.

05:54.080 --> 05:55.896
Okay? You're not the only
one with messed up parents.

05:55.920 --> 05:58.879
My parents are white.
Have you seen me?

05:58.880 --> 05:59.880
Yeah.

05:59.881 --> 06:01.560
I'm the only black
person that they know.

06:01.590 --> 06:02.606
Do you know how that feels?

06:02.630 --> 06:04.160
So, what you're telling
me, you grew up with

06:04.180 --> 06:05.960
no black culture whatsoever?

06:06.000 --> 06:07.100
I listened to music.

06:07.130 --> 06:10.370
Natalie Cole, Sammy
Davis Jr., James Brown.

06:10.400 --> 06:12.376
These are the people that I
learned my culture from.

06:12.400 --> 06:16.370
- Who's Sammy Davis Jr.?
- Are you kidding me right now?

06:16.410 --> 06:17.600
Hey.

06:17.740 --> 06:19.370
Where's mine?

06:19.410 --> 06:20.810
I ain't your wife.

06:20.840 --> 06:22.380
Well, you're barely his.

06:23.850 --> 06:26.510
Oh, my God.

06:26.550 --> 06:29.780
That looks like lust
and depression.

06:29.820 --> 06:32.340
Who's Samuel Davis Jr.?

06:32.460 --> 06:35.060
No favors. I want my money.

06:35.360 --> 06:37.430
All of it.

06:37.460 --> 06:38.890
200 thou.

06:38.930 --> 06:42.400
No. And my mama
don't need to know.

06:42.430 --> 06:43.970
All right. Peace.

06:45.340 --> 06:47.200
Don't worry.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.440
I know not to repeat
what I just heard.

06:49.470 --> 06:51.640
You are smart and cute.

06:51.680 --> 06:53.780
Who the hell is you?

06:54.680 --> 06:55.740
I'm Andy.

06:55.780 --> 06:57.100
So, what do you do?

06:57.220 --> 06:59.040
I'm trying to be a
singer over at Midtown.

06:59.100 --> 07:00.860
Well, maybe we
should get a drink.

07:00.940 --> 07:02.680
Maybe you can sing me something.

07:02.720 --> 07:04.450
I'm sorry, ma'am...

07:04.490 --> 07:06.090
Did you just call me "ma'am"?

07:06.120 --> 07:08.490
Too thirsty.

07:08.530 --> 07:10.190
But are you hungry?

07:12.060 --> 07:13.430
All right, guys.

07:13.460 --> 07:15.460
Guys.

07:15.500 --> 07:16.830
Thank you.

07:16.870 --> 07:19.500
Meet Natalie Knight. CEO
of Knight Universe.

07:19.540 --> 07:21.700
She's the top promoter
in the southeast.

07:21.740 --> 07:24.210
- Natalie.
- Nice to meet you guys. Yes?

07:24.240 --> 07:26.470
You're really pretty.

07:26.510 --> 07:29.210
Thank you.

07:29.250 --> 07:30.810
So we lost Sound House
and we got her?

07:30.850 --> 07:32.310
What you got is
someone who knows

07:32.350 --> 07:34.250
how to break artists
to new audiences.

07:34.280 --> 07:36.120
You guys have Atlanta
on lock, right?

07:36.150 --> 07:37.890
- They love us.
- That's great.

07:37.920 --> 07:39.419
But, see, for where
you want to go,

07:39.420 --> 07:40.960
it's gonna require so much more.

07:40.990 --> 07:43.420
- Like what?
- I got you guys a gig

07:43.540 --> 07:45.790
performing at Tallahassee A&M U.

07:45.830 --> 07:47.160
Oh, cool.

07:47.200 --> 07:50.130
I know the U's for "university."
What's the A&M for?

07:50.170 --> 07:52.430
Tallahassee Agricultural
and Mechanical University.

07:52.470 --> 07:53.976
It's only the most
important and historical

07:54.000 --> 07:55.979
black college in the country.

07:55.980 --> 07:56.980
Very good.

07:56.981 --> 07:58.379
I'm sorry, I don't
memorize the acronyms

07:58.380 --> 07:59.810
for colleges for fun.

07:59.840 --> 08:01.216
I mean, you slept with
enough black dudes.

08:01.240 --> 08:02.440
You could be alumni.

08:02.480 --> 08:04.526
So, the plan is, I'll get
with your management,

08:04.550 --> 08:07.350
set up some events
before the concert.

08:07.380 --> 08:08.796
Then we'll put together
an after-party

08:08.820 --> 08:10.550
with one of the hottest
DJs in the city

08:10.590 --> 08:12.220
and make you guys
look real good.

08:12.260 --> 08:14.436
So, th-this is what my career's come to?
I'm doing colleges now.

08:14.460 --> 08:15.460
Because if you're on the team,

08:15.461 --> 08:16.836
that means you have to
take a hit for them.

08:16.860 --> 08:18.860
And the rest of you

08:18.900 --> 08:20.960
need to establish a fan base

08:21.000 --> 08:22.476
with the college
kids on this campus.

08:22.500 --> 08:26.270
Landing the college audience
is key to your careers.

08:26.300 --> 08:28.940
It's gonna be a true
indicator of success.

08:28.970 --> 08:31.310
I need to see if you
guys have what it takes.

08:31.340 --> 08:33.010
Oh, we got what it takes.

08:33.039 --> 08:34.799
And you better believe, when
me and Angel hit that stage,

08:34.820 --> 08:38.049
there's gonna be panties
flying everywhere.

08:38.080 --> 08:40.110
If they can see your tiny
ass from the audience.

08:40.150 --> 08:41.796
- That's what I'm saying.
- Wow. Maybe if you moved

08:41.820 --> 08:43.419
them tig ol' bitties
out the way,

08:43.419 --> 08:44.466
somebody can see something.

08:44.490 --> 08:46.990
Did you save up your
money to get those done?

08:47.020 --> 08:49.560
Whatever act gets the
most heat on the campus,

08:49.590 --> 08:51.590
you could be the next big thing.

08:51.630 --> 08:53.730
You never know what could
happen in a weekend.

08:53.760 --> 08:57.030
All right. Y'all are done.

08:57.070 --> 08:58.670
It's nice meeting all of you.

08:58.700 --> 09:01.200
- Pleasure.
- Isn't he adorable?

09:04.570 --> 09:05.840
Tough crowd.

09:05.880 --> 09:08.280
Yeah. Look, I hope
you're right about this.

09:08.310 --> 09:10.480
- This whole tour is on my shoulders.
- Whoa.

09:10.510 --> 09:12.910
Stop whining.

09:12.950 --> 09:15.620
This is why I broke
up with your ass.

09:15.650 --> 09:16.780
I got this.

09:30.720 --> 09:33.340
Hey. Uh, uh, come in. You...

09:33.400 --> 09:34.759
Can I get you anything?

09:34.760 --> 09:36.460
Nah, I'm good.

09:36.600 --> 09:38.036
So, what, you Arnold's
girlfriend or something?

09:38.060 --> 09:39.630
'Cause I'm not trying
to get with him.

09:39.670 --> 09:41.000
I just want him to meet his son.

09:41.030 --> 09:43.300
You always did have a
mouth on you, Kish.

09:43.340 --> 09:44.740
Who are you?

09:44.770 --> 09:47.240
I'm Arnold.

09:47.270 --> 09:49.340
Look, I am not in the
mood for games, Miss.

09:49.410 --> 09:51.540
So where is he?

09:51.580 --> 09:54.250
He's here.

09:58.620 --> 10:01.620
What the hell did you go and
do to yourself, Arnold?

10:03.420 --> 10:05.890
How you just gonna pop up
here and drop this on me

10:05.930 --> 10:08.290
and not even have the decency
to tell me his name?

10:08.330 --> 10:12.230
Jaden.

10:12.270 --> 10:15.630
And he wants to meet his father,

10:15.670 --> 10:18.200
not whatever you are.

10:23.910 --> 10:25.580
Got it? Thank you.

10:25.710 --> 10:29.510
Ah, Miss Carlotta. Just the
woman I was looking for.

10:29.550 --> 10:32.580
So, what time are we rolling
out to Tallahassee tomorrow?

10:32.620 --> 10:34.460
I hear you think
this is beneath you.

10:34.560 --> 10:35.720
- No.
- It's not.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.790
It's a smart move.

10:37.820 --> 10:40.460
- 5:00 a.m., we out.
- No, I-I get it. I get it.

10:40.490 --> 10:41.906
- Teamwork makes the dream work.
- All right.

10:41.930 --> 10:44.760
All right? Just let me know what
Natalie's trying to pay me.

10:44.800 --> 10:46.130
I need three. All right?

10:46.170 --> 10:48.570
I'm trying to get some equipment
so I can record on the road.

10:48.600 --> 10:50.030
- All right, I got you.
- Please.

10:50.070 --> 10:52.300
You know, you've been grinding
pretty steady lately.

10:52.340 --> 10:54.746
- When am I gonna hear something?
- Well, you get that money up,

10:54.770 --> 10:56.370
and we can kind of
have a conversation.

10:56.410 --> 10:57.486
I'm gonna get that money up,

10:57.510 --> 10:58.556
so you better have
that music ready.

10:58.580 --> 10:59.980
I got you.

11:00.010 --> 11:02.450
It's fire, too. It's
like blazing fire.

11:02.480 --> 11:03.696
Give me something to work with.

11:03.720 --> 11:05.180
- Have it ready.
- What's up, man?

11:05.220 --> 11:07.420
Hey, so... Uh, what's
this I hear about, uh,

11:07.450 --> 11:09.720
some college gig in Tallahassee?

11:09.760 --> 11:11.760
Oh, the promoter thinks
it'll be good for exposure.

11:11.790 --> 11:13.406
- What, you're just hearing about it?
- What? Nah.

11:13.430 --> 11:14.836
I've been knowing about it.
Yeah, I just...

11:14.860 --> 11:16.160
- I've been taking care of some stuff.
- Mm-mm.

11:16.180 --> 11:18.130
You slippin', Jahil.

11:18.160 --> 11:19.446
You're getting too
old for this, huh?

11:19.470 --> 11:22.000
- You ain't so young yourself.
- Mm-hmm.

11:22.030 --> 11:23.300
You could still get it, though.

11:23.340 --> 11:26.700
Don't. Don't. Don't even.

11:28.240 --> 11:29.610
Right back at you.

11:40.650 --> 11:42.120
Here you go.

11:42.150 --> 11:43.650
Here we go.

11:44.060 --> 11:46.740
Aw. I'm so proud of you.

11:50.930 --> 11:52.500
Don't look at me like that.

11:52.530 --> 11:53.560
Why not?

11:53.600 --> 11:54.940
- Because.
- 'Cause why?

11:55.060 --> 11:57.400
'Cause...

11:59.970 --> 12:03.340
This what I'm paying for, now?

12:03.380 --> 12:05.600
What happened to knocking?

12:05.660 --> 12:07.340
You used to knock
when Alex was here.

12:07.380 --> 12:09.080
Alex was your girlfriend.
This one here

12:09.120 --> 12:10.610
is supposed to be
helping you walk.

12:10.650 --> 12:12.420
Not get your freak on.

12:12.450 --> 12:14.850
You know what? I'm-I'm gonna go.

12:14.890 --> 12:17.650
Yeah, you do that.

12:17.690 --> 12:20.090
We're gonna do
dinner still, right?

12:20.130 --> 12:21.530
Yeah.

12:22.260 --> 12:23.359
Dinner?

12:23.360 --> 12:24.360
Yes, dinner.

12:24.361 --> 12:25.960
For all the extra PT work.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.260
Oh, what is she, Mexican?

12:27.300 --> 12:29.700
And what if she is? Grandma,
what's wrong with you?

12:29.740 --> 12:31.716
I thought you were supposed to
be staying over at Bo's tonight.

12:31.740 --> 12:33.440
Can't you go back over
there, or something?

12:33.500 --> 12:34.500
This is my house.

12:34.540 --> 12:37.170
I come back from Bo's
when I damn well please.

12:37.210 --> 12:38.310
Ha.

12:38.340 --> 12:40.780
Fine. Go ahead.

12:40.810 --> 12:42.810
Guess I'll have to put
up with your snoring.

12:42.850 --> 12:45.156
When I find my hustle, I'm
getting the hell up out of here.

12:45.180 --> 12:46.480
I promise.

12:46.520 --> 12:47.990
I know you're tired
of seeing me.

12:48.020 --> 12:50.220
I'm tired of seeing you, too.

12:50.260 --> 12:52.020
Good night.

12:52.680 --> 12:55.260
You ungrateful

12:55.300 --> 12:56.940
bastard.

12:57.700 --> 13:00.130
Do that.

13:00.170 --> 13:01.500
Yeah.

13:03.100 --> 13:04.160
I mean, to finally work with

13:04.180 --> 13:05.720
a female promoter?

13:05.740 --> 13:07.800
It wasn't like that for me
back with Mixed Harmony.

13:07.940 --> 13:10.410
Ah, well, it's still
a boy's game.

13:10.440 --> 13:12.540
Maurice says good
things about you.

13:12.580 --> 13:14.410
Mo's got to say that.

13:14.450 --> 13:17.010
I know all his dirt.

13:17.050 --> 13:20.980
So... About Noah doing a
walk-through tonight.

13:21.020 --> 13:22.750
What kind of number
you have in mind?

13:22.790 --> 13:26.490
Zero. Shorty Black is the
hottest DJ in Florida.

13:26.530 --> 13:28.630
So, if he likes your artists,
he'll get them played

13:28.660 --> 13:31.200
in the clubs and in all the
colleges in the state.

13:31.230 --> 13:32.846
I understand Noah is
still on the comeback,

13:32.870 --> 13:35.070
but he's still got a name
that pulls an audience.

13:35.100 --> 13:38.200
And yet, Sound House
passed on him.

13:38.240 --> 13:41.270
I mean, isn't that why I'm here?

13:41.310 --> 13:44.170
I'm not letting my artist do a
walk-through for less than $5K.

13:44.210 --> 13:46.880
And I'll be sure to let Maurice
know you're trying to play us.

13:46.910 --> 13:48.686
Okay, first of all, no one
is trying to play you.

13:48.710 --> 13:50.980
Maurice knows that I
keep my budgets tight.

13:51.020 --> 13:52.920
I hire students to
work the campus shows,

13:52.950 --> 13:54.620
and I don't pay
artists big-ass fees.

13:54.650 --> 13:57.220
And just so you know,
bringing up his name

13:57.260 --> 13:58.990
is not gonna help you.

13:59.020 --> 14:02.390
I mean, unless you guys
have something going on.

14:02.430 --> 14:06.130
I don't need Maurice
to fight my battles.

14:06.170 --> 14:09.070
I just need you to live up
to the rep that he gave you.

14:11.140 --> 14:13.270
Okay.

14:13.310 --> 14:14.470
Fine.

14:14.510 --> 14:16.240
Noah will get his money.

14:16.280 --> 14:18.510
And you can tell Maurice
that I came correct,

14:18.540 --> 14:20.810
'cause I know he goes after
women that he works with.

14:20.850 --> 14:22.810
It's good, ain't it?

14:22.850 --> 14:25.420
See you on the tour.

14:30.820 --> 14:32.960
You ever thought about
going to college?

14:34.390 --> 14:36.530
- You're not going to college.
- I never said I was.

14:36.560 --> 14:37.900
- All right.
- I was just asking.

14:38.040 --> 14:39.460
You're not going.

14:41.130 --> 14:42.970
Hey.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.070
Carlotta didn't feel like

14:45.100 --> 14:49.040
picking me up at Noah's in the
morning, so I'm staying here.

14:49.070 --> 14:52.340
Look, can we get to the
part where you're like,

14:52.380 --> 14:53.580
"It just happened."

14:54.480 --> 14:55.980
And then you're like,

14:56.020 --> 14:58.580
"It doesn't matter. We need
to focus on the group."

14:58.620 --> 15:00.220
- Funny.
- I hate you.

15:00.250 --> 15:01.726
Or we could talk about, like,

15:01.750 --> 15:03.350
me doing it with Angel.

15:03.390 --> 15:04.390
Doing what?

15:04.391 --> 15:05.660
Doing it with Angel?

15:05.690 --> 15:08.950
Just-just uh... sex, okay?

15:08.960 --> 15:10.336
You can't have sex with him.

15:10.360 --> 15:11.530
You just met him.

15:11.560 --> 15:12.860
Girl, I'm married.

15:12.900 --> 15:14.260
That's true. She's married.

15:14.300 --> 15:16.479
Oh, what, so,
'cause I'm a whore,

15:16.480 --> 15:18.376
I don't get to have an opinion
about my little sister?

15:18.400 --> 15:20.540
No, no, no. You a... you a ho.

15:23.720 --> 15:26.620
We got a long day tomorrow;
y'all better shut it down soon.

15:26.680 --> 15:29.380
We got to get down there
and get ahead of the game.

15:29.420 --> 15:31.650
Wait, Andy and Angel are
already in Tallahassee.

15:31.680 --> 15:33.026
- What are you talking about?
- What?

15:33.050 --> 15:34.220
Look at this.

15:34.250 --> 15:36.190
We down here at Tally A&M!

15:37.560 --> 15:39.220
Yeah!

15:39.260 --> 15:41.590
We're about to show y'all
who the real artists

15:41.630 --> 15:43.590
that run Midtown are. You know,

15:43.630 --> 15:44.830
forget old man Noah.

15:44.860 --> 15:46.430
Forget Take Three.

15:46.470 --> 15:48.230
They're already at it.

15:48.270 --> 15:50.800
And, of course, throwing shade.

15:50.840 --> 15:53.260
- We need to get to Florida.

Wow.

17:05.520 --> 17:07.960
I would totally go to
a sorority for that.

17:10.500 --> 17:12.930
Star, isn't that your friend?

17:12.960 --> 17:15.829
Oh, oh, my God, he's so fine,

17:15.869 --> 17:16.945
and he's taking his shirt off.

17:16.970 --> 17:18.400
I can't even look at him. Go.

17:18.440 --> 17:20.540
- No, don't make me do that.
- Go.

17:31.850 --> 17:33.200
Maurice said he needed a roadie.

17:34.040 --> 17:36.050
I, uh, needed the money.

17:36.090 --> 17:37.950
But I was hoping
this would give me

17:37.960 --> 17:39.720
a chance to maybe
take you out again.

17:39.760 --> 17:43.430

You know what? This
is on your cheap ass,

28:43.160 --> 28:44.570
using students to
manage the sound.

28:44.700 --> 28:47.090
Well, hold up. First of all,
this has never happened

28:47.100 --> 28:48.100
on one of my shows before.

28:48.110 --> 28:49.740
Maybe you need to
check your girls.

28:49.770 --> 28:51.840
Or is this really about
the fact that you're not

28:51.870 --> 28:53.116
the only one who's
been with Maurice?

28:53.140 --> 28:56.080
Don't nobody care what
y'all used to do.

28:56.110 --> 28:58.510
Let me tell you something, lady.

28:58.550 --> 29:01.080
The only thing I need to do is
what's best for my artists.

29:01.120 --> 29:04.790
And not you or anyone else is
gonna get in the way of that.

29:16.060 --> 29:17.400
You always operate on ten?

29:17.430 --> 29:19.960
What are you doing? Hello?

29:20.160 --> 29:22.240
I'm slashing his tires.
What you think I'm doing?

29:22.270 --> 29:23.786
- What?
- I saw Andy backstage.

29:23.810 --> 29:26.270
He was talking to the sound guy.
He messed your show up.

29:26.310 --> 29:27.486
- Wait, what?
- Are you serious?

29:27.510 --> 29:29.580
- Yeah.
- He's the one that did that to us.

29:29.610 --> 29:31.586
- You gotta be kidding.
- I saw that little Keebler elf

29:31.610 --> 29:33.950
backstage grinning. You
messed up our sound,

29:33.980 --> 29:34.876
I'm messing with your car.

29:34.888 --> 29:35.796
Psycho trailer trash
bitch slashing tires?!

29:35.820 --> 29:37.840
I'm the white trash, bro.
I saw what you did.

29:37.860 --> 29:39.766
Yes, you are white trash!
Get the hell out of my way!

29:39.790 --> 29:42.120
I got it, I got it. What's up?

29:45.630 --> 29:46.630
Stop.

29:46.660 --> 29:48.436
You gonna let your sister
wreck his car like that?

29:48.460 --> 29:49.730
Bro, were you a part of this?

29:49.770 --> 29:51.630
Of course I wasn't, okay?
He went rogue.

29:51.670 --> 29:53.816
Are you gonna make an excuse
every time he does something

29:53.840 --> 29:55.446
- psychotic and crazy?
- You gonna let your sister

29:55.470 --> 29:56.916
act like a bitch
every time she does?

29:56.940 --> 29:58.116
That is the last time you're

29:58.140 --> 30:00.110
gonna call my sister a
bitch, you hear me?

30:00.140 --> 30:02.680
He's the one that started this,
and if you can't see that,

30:02.710 --> 30:03.880
then we got an issue!

30:03.910 --> 30:05.580
Simone!

30:05.610 --> 30:07.296
Oh, you took pictures
to send to your daddy?

30:07.320 --> 30:09.820
It's called insurance!
Can you afford some?

30:09.850 --> 30:13.110
- You gonna slash my damn tires!
- Let's go. Come on, let's go.

30:13.120 --> 30:14.396
Ugly-ass ho couldn't even afford

30:14.420 --> 30:16.460
- one of my tires!
- Get out of the way.

30:16.490 --> 30:18.690
Really?

30:18.730 --> 30:20.830
You good? You happy now?

30:20.860 --> 30:22.400
Almost.

30:22.430 --> 30:24.630
There's two more over there.

30:28.560 --> 30:30.599
You might be a good hairdresser,
but you're not a good manager.

30:30.600 --> 30:32.576
I don't want to hear that, Jahil.
I told you to nip this

30:32.600 --> 30:34.426
- in the bud.
- Don't even try to put it on my boys...

30:34.450 --> 30:35.866
- And don't act like you never...
- Don't put it on your boys?

30:35.890 --> 30:37.126
Your boys are just that...
they're boys.

30:37.150 --> 30:38.496
Don't try to blame me and don't
try to act like you never...

30:38.520 --> 30:39.990
You're supposed
to be making men.

30:40.020 --> 30:41.300
What's the matter?

30:41.400 --> 30:42.790
Jahil?

30:42.830 --> 30:45.930
I'm all right. It's okay.

30:46.260 --> 30:49.060
- You back on that stuff?
- No, I'm not, all right? Don't. Just...

30:49.100 --> 30:50.706
- I'm clean, all right?
- Tell me what you took.

30:50.730 --> 30:52.996
- I'm calling an ambulance.
- Just put the damn phone down, okay?

30:53.020 --> 30:54.500
It's not drugs.

30:55.970 --> 30:58.270
It's my heart.

30:58.310 --> 30:59.780
Your heart?

31:03.680 --> 31:06.180
Who else knows about this?

31:06.220 --> 31:07.820
No one, all right?
Don't say nothing

31:07.850 --> 31:09.150
to Cotton about it, all right?

31:09.190 --> 31:11.690
This is no big deal.

31:11.720 --> 31:12.960
Hey, man.

31:12.990 --> 31:16.430
Carlotta, baby, we got to...

31:16.460 --> 31:17.860
Don't "baby" me.

31:17.900 --> 31:20.530
- You could've just told me.
- So Natalie's right,

31:20.540 --> 31:21.560
you trippin' off of that.

31:21.600 --> 31:23.470
Carlotta, that was old.

31:23.500 --> 31:25.370
We can't ruin our
relationship with Natalie.

31:25.400 --> 31:27.640
Is that the only relationship
you're worried about?

31:27.670 --> 31:28.940
Hey, stop trippin'.

31:28.970 --> 31:31.120
We can't do this
tour without her.

31:31.200 --> 31:33.140
We can't get Sound House
without this tour.

31:33.180 --> 31:34.640
You think I don't know that?

31:34.680 --> 31:36.156
Now, I'm gonna go in here
and fix what's broke.

31:36.180 --> 31:38.850
'Cause my artists
can't get a bad rep.

31:38.880 --> 31:40.179
Check me again,

31:40.180 --> 31:42.100
and me and you gonna
have a problem.

31:44.520 --> 31:47.660

She's really on a mission.

33:43.070 --> 33:46.110
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no, no.
You got to chill, baby.

33:46.120 --> 33:47.256
No, no, no, you got
to chill on that.

33:47.280 --> 33:49.440
Hey, yo, what you need
to do is fall back.

33:49.480 --> 33:51.610
- Alex.
- First of all, bitch,

33:51.650 --> 33:52.856
- he ain't got no ring.
- I'm sorry,

33:52.880 --> 33:54.996
- what did you just call me?
- She just called you a bitch.

33:55.020 --> 33:56.666
- That's what I heard.
- Star, come on.

33:56.690 --> 33:59.220
Well, you need to
walk away, bitch.

33:59.260 --> 34:01.200
Yup.

34:01.240 --> 34:04.290
Please.

34:04.330 --> 34:05.379
Star, I got this.

34:05.380 --> 34:06.829
Hold on, hold on. Come here,
come here, come here.

34:06.830 --> 34:08.005
- What?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

34:08.030 --> 34:09.103
Star.

34:09.114 --> 34:10.199
I should call the cops
on your ass, bitch!

34:10.230 --> 34:12.000
Call them from my phone!

34:12.040 --> 34:13.800
That was crazy, right?

34:13.840 --> 34:15.739
Fans. Come here.

34:15.770 --> 34:18.090
I don't like being
embarrassed, Noah.

34:18.100 --> 34:20.580
What-what? That's a fan. I
had no control in that.

34:20.610 --> 34:23.280
- Come on. Stop tripping.
- No.

34:25.179 --> 34:27.719
What?

34:27.750 --> 34:29.520
Alex.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.199
Andy, what you did was
dirty, and you know it.

34:36.040 --> 34:37.956
And you know not to mess with Star...
she's mentally ill.

34:37.980 --> 34:40.370
- She pushed me.
- You not just an artist...

34:40.380 --> 34:41.820
You are an employee
for this label.

34:41.840 --> 34:43.510
You making us all look bad.

34:43.550 --> 34:45.679
Now, as far as that internship
program, you're done.

34:48.120 --> 34:50.520
I had a lapse of judgment.

34:50.560 --> 34:53.860
I'm sorry. You know
I need this job.

34:53.889 --> 34:55.690
My folks are gonna cut me off.

34:55.730 --> 34:57.530
So then you'll have
to fend for yourself

34:57.560 --> 34:59.246
- for the first time in your life
- Yo, will you shut up?!

34:59.270 --> 35:01.570
- Like the rest of us!
- Hey, hey, hey!

35:01.600 --> 35:05.070
Look, you jeopardized
the whole tour.

35:05.100 --> 35:07.086
- I understand...
- Now... No, you pull another stunt,

35:07.110 --> 35:08.740
I'll take you off that, too.

35:19.490 --> 35:21.220
I'm not mentally
ill, by the way.

35:21.250 --> 35:22.820
Yeah, I know.

35:22.860 --> 35:26.300
When you feel threatened, you fight.
I get it.

35:28.530 --> 35:31.180
Just be careful out there, Star.

35:43.740 --> 35:46.110
The Mexican's back.

35:48.980 --> 35:50.180
Hey.

35:50.220 --> 35:53.080
- Don't come closer.
- Okay.

35:53.120 --> 35:55.850
You ain't no rebound. Trust me.

35:55.890 --> 35:58.000
If you haven't noticed, my
grandma is a little crazy.

35:58.080 --> 35:59.536
No, she's not crazy.
She's a crazy witch.

35:59.560 --> 36:01.730
And I'm Colombian, by the way!

36:01.760 --> 36:04.730
You're important to me, okay?

36:04.760 --> 36:08.670
And if I have to get another
physical therapist, I will.

36:08.700 --> 36:12.400
But I want you to be with me.

36:12.440 --> 36:13.670
Uh...

36:13.710 --> 36:15.670
I said stay there.

36:15.710 --> 36:18.140
Fine.

36:54.680 --> 36:56.980
- Can I go forward now?
- Yeah.

37:05.530 --> 37:08.130
Hello?

37:08.160 --> 37:10.390
Yes, yes, this is
his grandmother.

37:12.300 --> 37:15.070
No, we haven't heard anything
about the settlement yet.

37:17.840 --> 37:19.970
A check?

37:20.010 --> 37:21.910
How much?

37:21.940 --> 37:24.810
Thank you for coming back.

37:24.840 --> 37:28.180
Well, I still have questions.

37:28.210 --> 37:31.050
So what are you working
with down there?

37:31.080 --> 37:33.080
- What?
- I'm sorry, but...

37:33.120 --> 37:34.796
I have to ask that if you're
gonna be around my child.

37:34.820 --> 37:36.620
You mean that's <i> our</i> child.

37:36.660 --> 37:38.360
I just never thought
having a baby daddy

37:38.390 --> 37:39.460
would be this complicated.

37:39.480 --> 37:40.860
Well, try being one.

37:40.890 --> 37:43.190
With double D's.

37:47.470 --> 37:50.170
I forgot how funny you were.

37:50.200 --> 37:52.400
Well, not everything
about me has changed.

37:57.410 --> 37:58.450
You want to see a picture?

37:58.480 --> 37:59.640
Yes.

38:01.810 --> 38:03.010
Okay.

38:08.520 --> 38:11.020
He's beautiful.

38:12.330 --> 38:13.896
Yeah, he is.

38:13.897 --> 38:17.730
Cot! Me and your father
are here, like you asked.

38:20.500 --> 38:23.730
I got to tell y'all something.

38:23.770 --> 38:27.470
Meet the mother
of your grandson.

38:27.510 --> 38:30.640
What grandson?

38:34.850 --> 38:38.080
Maurice kicked me out of
the internship today.

38:38.120 --> 38:41.220
My parents are gonna lose
it when they find out.

38:41.250 --> 38:42.400
You need a plan B.

38:42.420 --> 38:43.936
I got to find out how
to get some money.

38:43.960 --> 38:45.960
'Cause I ain't asking
them for nothing.

38:50.430 --> 38:52.260
Simone...

38:54.630 --> 38:57.130
I'm-I'm sorry.

39:14.920 --> 39:17.140
Look, if we're gonna do
this whole marriage thing,

39:17.180 --> 39:18.536
you've got to understand
I'm always gonna have

39:18.560 --> 39:19.890
my sister's back.

39:19.930 --> 39:21.499
You can't even begin
to understand

39:21.500 --> 39:22.560
what we've been through.

39:22.600 --> 39:25.560
Try me. I'm not gonna judge you.

39:25.600 --> 39:27.330
I'm not a saint.
Neither is my family.

39:27.370 --> 39:30.570
Have you... have you seen Jahil?

39:30.600 --> 39:33.140
Right?

39:33.170 --> 39:35.710
I know she's your family.

39:35.740 --> 39:38.840
Yeah, someday I'll tell you.

39:45.850 --> 39:48.520
Well, I'll be here
when you're ready.

39:59.830 --> 40:01.070

Get your ass in this car.

40:42.240 --> 40:44.710
If you still mad, then I might
as well go get some work done.

40:44.740 --> 40:46.110
I'm more disappointed.

40:46.150 --> 40:48.110
This isn't what I imagined.

40:48.150 --> 40:50.180
What did you think it'd be?

40:50.220 --> 40:52.950
Not us going reality show
ratchet with a groupie.

40:52.990 --> 40:55.020
I hated it when my mom did it.

40:55.050 --> 40:57.420
I don't want to date my dad.

40:57.460 --> 40:59.090
I'm not your dad.

40:59.130 --> 41:01.030
All right.

41:01.060 --> 41:03.560
I'm fire. You're ice.

41:03.600 --> 41:05.960
That's why we work.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.070
And you're corny,
is what you are.

41:08.100 --> 41:10.200
Yeah, well, kiss my corny lips.

41:12.510 --> 41:14.200
That's better.

41:18.540 --> 41:21.750
Look, you're the
only woman for me.

41:21.780 --> 41:23.600
I mean that.

41:29.620 --> 41:32.020
We really should take a
break before I finish.

41:32.060 --> 41:35.060
It's cool. I don't mind the pain.
Go for it.

41:35.090 --> 41:36.260
Who's Mary?

41:36.300 --> 41:38.100
That's my mama's name.

41:39.280 --> 41:41.680
I never understood why
she named me Star.

41:42.440 --> 41:45.400
But now I finally get it.

41:45.440 --> 41:47.370
She was a singer, like me,

41:47.380 --> 41:50.570
but she died before
she made it, and...

41:50.610 --> 41:54.310
I think she just wanted me
to be what she couldn't be.

42:08.960 --> 42:11.730
Well, we've come a long way

42:11.760 --> 42:14.570
from getting Lucious's
venti black coffees.

42:14.600 --> 42:17.600
You remember what
he used to say?

42:19.640 --> 42:22.670
"Don't forget my
shot of yak, man."

42:22.710 --> 42:24.270
You always remembered.

42:27.180 --> 42:29.850
You know what else I remember?

42:30.620 --> 42:32.420
Everything you like.

42:36.160 --> 42:38.120
Natalie, I'm seeing someone.

42:38.160 --> 42:41.790
Yeah, yeah, I picked that up.

42:44.400 --> 42:45.730
You know what, it's late.

42:45.770 --> 42:47.360
Let's talk about
the tour tomorrow.

42:47.400 --> 42:49.770
Okay.

42:49.800 --> 42:53.140
You know, I got big
plans for this tour.

42:55.740 --> 42:57.670
I could get you
everything you'd want

42:57.710 --> 43:00.040
with Charles...

43:00.080 --> 43:03.160
with Midtown.

43:11.190 --> 43:13.360
I mean...

43:15.690 --> 43:18.130
if you're down.
