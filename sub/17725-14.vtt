00:21.462 --> 00:23.213
You should do the school musical.

00:23.248 --> 00:26.149
- What? Why?
- Because you're good...

00:26.183 --> 00:28.318
and because I think we've all
had enough of Brenna Shenkin.

00:28.336 --> 00:29.970
I mean, come on, the girl gets
one line in Law & Order,

00:29.720 --> 00:31.721
and we have to pretend
she's Bernadette Peters?

00:31.755 --> 00:33.423
Cheesy musicals aren't my scene.

00:33.457 --> 00:36.326
School ends for the day, and
I have to stay voluntarily.

00:36.360 --> 00:37.827
What's in it for me?

00:37.862 --> 00:40.597
Friends and memories
that last a lifetime.

00:40.631 --> 00:43.399
- Hard pass.
- Wait. Go back, go back, go back.

00:43.434 --> 00:45.168
<i>What? That's just the list
of Wi-Fi networks.</i>

00:45.202 --> 00:47.136
Look at this one.
"Rock 'n' roll Lemieux-sic."

00:47.171 --> 00:49.406
- How brilliant is that?
- I think you're gonna

00:49.407 --> 00:51.407
have to explain to us
how brilliant that is.

00:51.442 --> 00:55.879
"Lemieux-sic," like Mario Lemieux.
I love hockey, I love music,

00:55.913 --> 00:57.213
- and I love wordplay.
- Is that wordplay?

00:57.248 --> 00:58.781
Yeah, because it's Lemieux-sic.

00:58.816 --> 01:00.817
I'm not gonna explain
to you how comedy works.

01:00.851 --> 01:02.418
Well, why don't you
find out who this guy is

01:02.453 --> 01:03.953
and then hang out with him?

01:03.988 --> 01:06.990
Honey, guys don't make friends
like that. It just happens.

01:07.024 --> 01:09.959
Sometimes you find something
electric, like me and Harris.

01:09.994 --> 01:13.930
Yeah, that's getting kind of creepy.
Maybe you want to branch out.

01:13.964 --> 01:16.330
Okay, Henrys, high-speed internet time.

01:16.365 --> 01:18.437
Get ready to rocket into the...

01:18.472 --> 01:20.069

- Oh, my...

<i>♪ telling me what to do ♪</i>

01:21.572 --> 01:23.439
<i>You guys, is that
even... is that necessary?</i>

01:23.474 --> 01:26.509
- Oh, god. It smells like burning flesh.
- How do I find this guy?

01:26.544 --> 01:28.178
- Floor-to-floor search.
- Great.

01:28.212 --> 01:30.413
Let's start in the basement
and work our way up.

01:31.749 --> 01:34.875

01:45.896 --> 01:47.831
Jeez, you write one cranky
letter to Reader's Digest,

01:47.865 --> 01:50.867
and all of a sudden, you're
on the A.A.R.P.'s mailing list.

01:50.901 --> 01:52.502
Oh, hey, don't look now, but I think

01:52.536 --> 01:54.304
that's your guy with
the cool Wi-Fi name.

01:54.338 --> 01:58.741
- Rock 'n' roll Lemieux-sic?
- Sorry, did you just say my Wi-Fi name?

01:58.776 --> 02:01.477
Oh, uh, sorry.
My wife and I were just going through

02:01.512 --> 02:06.649
all the Wi-Fi networks in the building,
which is a totally normal thing to do.

02:06.684 --> 02:09.886
Wait. You're not
"Bobby Hull and Oates," are you?

02:09.919 --> 02:12.355
- He shoots, he scores.
- That's cool.

02:12.389 --> 02:14.491
No, you're cool.

02:15.860 --> 02:17.861
See you around.

02:19.530 --> 02:22.732
<i>Okay, what are you doing?
He likes you.</i>

02:22.766 --> 02:26.035
- You think so?
- Dude, you were clearly vibing.

02:26.070 --> 02:28.504
- Go talk to him.
- My hair's all funny.

02:28.539 --> 02:30.507
You get in there.
You close that.

02:30.541 --> 02:32.408
- Come on, I'm right behind you.
- You're a hell of a wingman.

02:32.443 --> 02:34.010
Where were you when I was dating?

02:34.044 --> 02:36.012
I was dating guys that
had better game than you.

02:36.046 --> 02:37.513
I'm sorry, I didn't introduce myself.

02:37.548 --> 02:40.383
- I'm Mike Henry.
- Will.

02:40.417 --> 02:43.286
And this is my wife...
was my wife.

02:43.320 --> 02:48.191
- Ah, so... come here often?
- Once a day.

02:48.225 --> 02:49.993
- The mail.
- Yeah.

02:53.831 --> 02:55.099
Hey, Ian...

02:56.133 --> 02:58.801
I'm looking at secret files!
Get out!

03:00.171 --> 03:02.405
Good lord, what did that poor kid see?

03:02.439 --> 03:04.908
I used to lock the door
while the video was buffering.

03:04.942 --> 03:06.709
Damn you, high-speed internet.

03:07.912 --> 03:10.947
I'm so glad you wanted to come
to one of these literary nights.

03:10.981 --> 03:13.666
My friends always have
other things they want to do,

03:13.667 --> 03:16.352
like watch the kids
or get up early for work.

03:16.387 --> 03:20.356
See, this is what Mom doesn't get.
This is my scene.

03:20.391 --> 03:24.460
It's gritty, the people are real,
and you can smell the creativity.

03:24.495 --> 03:27.096
Oh, sweetie.
That's Puke and Patchouli.

03:27.131 --> 03:28.498
Well, listen, this is
what they're going to do.

03:28.532 --> 03:30.033
They're gonna draw names out of a hat,

03:30.067 --> 03:32.402
and whoever gets picked
tells an impromptu story.

03:32.436 --> 03:35.839
Great.
Let's pull up a big wheel and watch.

03:40.478 --> 03:45.615
It rained with a menacing sobriety
the day my father left.

03:45.649 --> 03:49.152
<i>Each droplet like a tear
streaming down my face.</i>

03:49.186 --> 03:54.892
<i>And there is a 100% chance...</i>

03:56.327 --> 03:59.829
Science can't tell us
where the rain comes from...

03:59.864 --> 04:02.699
Someone should tell him
science has kind of figured out rain.

04:02.733 --> 04:05.668
Hey, how's the weather
where you are, dad?

04:05.703 --> 04:09.572
Bad luck.

04:09.607 --> 04:13.610
- I could fix you.
- I forgot to put my name in the hat.

04:13.644 --> 04:15.445
<i>It's not so much the way
I feel, but the way I look.</i>

04:15.479 --> 04:17.247
<i>You see me on the street,
and you think this.</i>

04:17.281 --> 04:18.414
<i>I show you that.</i>

04:20.384 --> 04:21.651
I'm telling you, I've been
to a lot of hockey games.

04:21.685 --> 04:24.354
- I never got to drive the Zamboni.
- That's what I'm telling you.

04:24.388 --> 04:28.458
With 20 bucks and a smile, you can
talk yourself into any situation.

04:28.492 --> 04:30.126
You know, next to
the birth of my kids,

04:30.161 --> 04:32.996
this is probably the
best day of my life.

04:34.799 --> 04:37.834
<i>Oh, screw the kids. This is
definitely the best day of my life.</i>

04:37.868 --> 04:40.303
Hello?

04:40.337 --> 04:42.539
Hey, Mike.
I got three tickets to "La Boheme."

04:42.573 --> 04:45.308
One for me, one for you,
and a seat in between,

04:45.309 --> 04:47.944
- so it won't look weird.
- Harris, I can't talk right now.

04:47.978 --> 04:51.581
- I'm with my friend Will.
- Will? Who the hell is Will?

04:51.615 --> 04:55.418
- You want to play Joe Strummer's guitar?
- I gotta go.

04:57.822 --> 05:00.123
You know, we should
invite the wives next time.

05:00.157 --> 05:03.226
- That's a great idea.
- That's a terrible idea.

05:03.260 --> 05:05.228
Well, you said you wanted
more friends in the building.

05:05.262 --> 05:07.363
You. I wanted you...
to have a friend in the building.

05:07.398 --> 05:08.798
Couple friends are a
whole different ball game.

05:08.832 --> 05:11.518
- We have couple friends.
- Yes, but you know we each

05:11.519 --> 05:13.901
- secretly hate one of them.
- That's not true.

05:13.940 --> 05:15.274
- Ryan and Karen.
- Yeah, I hate Karen.

05:15.306 --> 05:16.806
- Geoff and Susan.
- Well, you hate Geoff.

05:16.841 --> 05:19.075
Well, I hate Geoff.
The kids hate Geoff.

05:19.109 --> 05:21.511
I'm just saying, what if
the wife doesn't like you,

05:21.545 --> 05:22.946
or I don't like the wife?

05:22.980 --> 05:27.449
- Did I mention they have a house in Fiji?
- What time is dinner?

05:30.280 --> 05:32.137
You know, just a thought.

05:32.172 --> 05:34.827
Maybe you could tone it
down a little tonight.

05:34.867 --> 05:38.561
- "Tone it down"? What are you talking about?
- That tone right there.

05:38.595 --> 05:40.663
You got so many better ones.
Just focus on those.

05:40.698 --> 05:44.167
I'll avoid that tone, Mike,
if they avoid being awful people.

05:44.201 --> 05:46.002
It's... it's really
up to them, isn't it?

05:46.036 --> 05:47.637
- Let's make a game of it.
- Okay.

05:47.671 --> 05:49.105
If they say something
you disagree with,

05:49.139 --> 05:51.407
let's time how long
you can smile politely.

05:51.442 --> 05:54.677
I'm not gonna change how I am just
to impress a couple of strangers.

05:54.712 --> 05:56.813
Sounds like someone
doesn't think they can win.

05:56.847 --> 05:58.848
Oh, hey. I'm Trista.

05:58.882 --> 06:01.467
Listen, Will was just giving
me a long list of subjects

06:01.468 --> 06:04.053
<i>not to talk about, but listen,
I'm gonna tell you anyway.</i>

06:04.088 --> 06:07.123
First of all, I'm not crazy about
people that say, "come with."

06:07.157 --> 06:10.293
<i>I don't believe...</i>

06:10.327 --> 06:13.096
and if your kid is old
enough to tie his own shoes,

06:13.130 --> 06:15.398
maybe not breast-feed in
the middle of farmers market.

06:15.432 --> 06:18.334
<i> Am I right?
Come on in.</i>

06:18.369 --> 06:22.639
She's perfect. And if I die
and you want to marry Trista,

06:22.673 --> 06:25.642
I'd totally understand.

06:32.316 --> 06:34.884
Hey, buddy.

06:38.622 --> 06:43.793
About the other day when
you came into my room, uh...

06:43.827 --> 06:48.565
you might have seen
something that... confused you.

06:48.599 --> 06:51.934
I wasn't confused.
Ian's a spy.

06:51.969 --> 06:54.971
He was looking at secret files,
he always wears fancy suits,

06:55.005 --> 06:58.341
and he gets really weird
when you ask him to explain his job.

06:58.375 --> 07:01.411
But I can't blow his cover,
or that will put him in danger.

07:01.445 --> 07:03.680
We don't have to talk about it.

07:03.714 --> 07:06.349
I think I might have
traumatized my little brother.

07:06.383 --> 07:08.818
Hey, Aunt Leigh.
I need you to help me dye my hair.

07:08.852 --> 07:12.388
Purple, like Barney?
Oh, is this to impress that hot guy

07:12.423 --> 07:13.857
who doesn't know how rain works?

07:13.891 --> 07:19.229
- No. This is who I am.
- Ah, sweetie, you can't pull off badass.

07:19.263 --> 07:21.302
- What?
- You can wear all the army

07:21.360 --> 07:23.666
jackets you like, which your
mother dry-cleans, by the way.

07:23.701 --> 07:26.429
But you can't hide the fact
that you're just a sweet,

07:26.430 --> 07:29.372
- happy kid who sings show tunes.
- Ironically.

07:29.406 --> 07:31.174
You don't get every signature

07:31.208 --> 07:33.610
from the original Broadway cast
of Mamma Mia! Ironically.

07:33.644 --> 07:35.912
You know what?
You're just like Mom.

07:35.946 --> 07:39.682
You think that I'm some sweet,
cheesy girl, but I am over that.

07:39.717 --> 07:44.621
I'm like Sandy at the end of Grease.
Damn it.

07:44.655 --> 07:46.322
You know what I hate?

07:46.357 --> 07:48.558
Waiters that come and sit
down when they take your order.

07:48.592 --> 07:50.994
Yeah, I mean, I'm sorry.
This isn't a "hang sesh."

07:51.028 --> 07:53.763
I'm paying you
to act like we're not friends.

07:53.798 --> 07:57.067
- Right!
- Trista and I had so much in common.

07:57.101 --> 08:00.503
- We hated all the same things.
- And Will liked me for me.

08:00.538 --> 08:02.238
He didn't even care that
I was a local celebrity,

08:02.273 --> 08:04.908
which made me want him all the more.

08:04.942 --> 08:08.278
- Okay, you're getting creepy again.
- Either way, we had to bring our "A" game.

08:08.312 --> 08:11.781
Do you guys like antique bowls?

08:11.816 --> 08:13.750
<i>Because there's an antique-bowl exhibit</i>

08:13.784 --> 08:17.220
at the Museum of ceramic art,
if you guys wanted to come with.

08:17.254 --> 08:18.188
- Us.
- Uh...

08:18.222 --> 08:19.722
- Come... come with us.

08:19.757 --> 08:21.524
Anyway, we just love
spending time together...

08:21.559 --> 08:23.026
- Yeah.
- And cooking meals...

08:23.060 --> 08:24.394
- Mm.
- And laughing.

08:24.428 --> 08:27.297
Putting sauce on each other's noses.

08:27.331 --> 08:28.765
Maybe I'm moving a little fast here,

08:28.799 --> 08:30.633
but we should all go on a trip sometime.

08:30.668 --> 08:32.785
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, I don't know

08:32.787 --> 08:34.904
if Mike mentioned it,
but we've got a house in Fiji.

08:34.938 --> 08:37.307
Oh, it was you guys
that had the house in Fiji.

08:37.341 --> 08:41.177
Yeah. In fact, we're going in May...
you know, if you guys can make it.

08:41.212 --> 08:44.246
It does overlap with
David and Iman, but they're fine.

08:44.280 --> 08:48.084
- Yeah, the Bowies are truly fun people.
- Oh, yeah.

08:48.119 --> 08:49.978
Well, we... we'll have
to check our calendars.

08:50.013 --> 08:51.156
Yes.

08:51.191 --> 08:53.356
- Fiji! We're going to Fiji!
- Fiji!

08:55.526 --> 08:58.194
- Hey.
- Cool hair.

08:58.229 --> 09:00.130
It kind of reminds me of Barney,

09:00.164 --> 09:02.132
the dinosaur who taught
us all to get in line.

09:02.166 --> 09:05.635
You get it.
I saw you speak the other night.

09:05.669 --> 09:07.637
- Oh.
- It was amazing.

09:07.672 --> 09:09.706
I mean, what happened
to you wasn't amazing,

09:09.740 --> 09:13.543
but the way that you
talked about it was amazing.

09:13.577 --> 09:18.248
- You talk real good.
- Cool. Thank you.

09:18.282 --> 09:19.983
- Thanks. I'm Andreas.
- I'm Eve.

09:20.017 --> 09:23.453
So are you going to
put your name in the hat?

09:23.487 --> 09:27.257
Why else would I be here?

09:27.291 --> 09:29.893
There were a million names in there.
I mean, there was no way

09:29.927 --> 09:32.962
- they were actually going to pick...
- Eve Henry.

09:42.740 --> 09:48.411
So my parents...
they don't understand me.

09:49.713 --> 09:53.583
My brothers are super annoying...

09:55.920 --> 09:59.089
probably because they're on drugs,
all the drugs...

09:59.123 --> 10:04.360
pot, coke, molly.
That's a thing.

10:04.395 --> 10:06.329
So I threw the whole
family under the bus.

10:06.363 --> 10:08.598
Also, I said we lived in a bus.

10:08.632 --> 10:11.167
But then I stumbled on to
something that was true.

10:11.202 --> 10:13.403
And my Mom... well,
she wants me to perform

10:13.437 --> 10:15.138
like a little street monkey.

10:15.172 --> 10:17.107
True-ish?

10:17.141 --> 10:19.542
Do you like that, Mother?

10:19.577 --> 10:23.012
You want me to sing
for my scraps, Mother?

10:23.047 --> 10:25.115
Well...
♪ do-re-leave me ♪

10:25.149 --> 10:26.783
alone.

10:31.756 --> 10:33.390
That was so raw.

10:33.424 --> 10:35.758
God, it must have been
hard to have so much pain,

10:35.793 --> 10:38.795
- like, so close to the surface...
- Thank you.

10:38.829 --> 10:42.065
Especially since the topic
was "first pets."

10:43.834 --> 10:47.237
So this is my desk and,
uh, you know, that little guy.

10:47.271 --> 10:49.773
<i>Oh.
It's us at the game.</i>

10:49.807 --> 10:51.708
<i>You're picking my nose
with a big foam finger.</i>

10:51.742 --> 10:53.543
I had a spare frame.

10:53.577 --> 10:55.245
- Iron Mike, let's grab lunch.
- Oh, I can't, Harris.

10:55.279 --> 10:56.679
I'm having lunch with my friend Will.

10:56.714 --> 10:59.382
- Will, this is my boss, Harris.
- Boss?

10:59.417 --> 11:02.519
I'm just your boss now?
I named a star after you, Mike.

11:02.553 --> 11:05.021
- Those things are just a scam.
- Uh-uh.

11:05.055 --> 11:08.291
I have a three-color
certificate says otherwise.

11:08.325 --> 11:12.128
Don't get too comfortable.
That used to be me in that frame.

11:12.163 --> 11:15.899
No. No, it wasn't.
It was my son Graham.

11:15.933 --> 11:19.602
So, lunch? Let's say we call
the womenfolk, have them join us?

11:19.637 --> 11:22.439
That may not be such a good idea.

11:22.473 --> 11:25.770
- Trista and I are having problems.
- Oh, no.

11:25.868 --> 11:28.812
<i>To be honest, I invited
you to dinner as a buffer.</i>

11:28.846 --> 11:32.182
In fact, seeing how happy
and perfect you and Annie are

11:32.183 --> 11:35.518
together made us realize
our marriage is a lost cause.

11:35.553 --> 11:39.756
How could you do this to us?

11:39.790 --> 11:43.493
Us, believers in love.

11:43.527 --> 11:46.596
- We liked them. They liked us.
- We all liked Fiji.

11:46.630 --> 11:49.833
The only variable we didn't think of
is that they wouldn't like each other.

11:49.867 --> 11:52.836
- Damn our perfect marriage.
- Ugh. I'm so sick of it.

11:52.870 --> 11:58.107
<i>Hello, NASA? Yeah, I'd like
to change the name of a star.</i>

11:58.142 --> 12:00.880
You're talking into a brownie, Harris.

12:01.716 --> 12:05.285
Ugh, I can't believe
Will and Trista are splitting up.

12:05.320 --> 12:06.887
They seemed so perfect.

12:06.921 --> 12:08.155
Well, just thank god
they don't have any kids.

12:08.189 --> 12:11.254
- Yeah, divorce can be hard on kids.
- It can be hard on friends, too.

12:11.289 --> 12:14.496
- I mean, even new friends.
- You know, in some ways, I think even harder.

12:14.531 --> 12:16.463
Yeah, because the kids get
two Christmases. What do we get?

12:16.497 --> 12:20.500
- Certainly not a free vacation in Fiji.
- We'd have to pay for it, like animals.

12:20.534 --> 12:21.868
Well, there's nothing
we can do about it now.

12:21.902 --> 12:25.939
You can't make people stay together.
This isn't the parent trap.

12:28.008 --> 12:30.375
- But...
- I'm listening.

12:30.410 --> 12:33.112
If we were to, like, say,
re-create a romantic moment

12:33.147 --> 12:36.962
from their lives that reminds them
of their love for each other...

12:36.997 --> 12:40.157
- That's just being good friends.
- And they got back together before May

12:40.192 --> 12:44.224
and wanted to repay us
by taking us to Fiji...

12:44.258 --> 12:45.925
- So be it.
- So be it.

12:47.795 --> 12:50.964
Oh, sorry!
You're doing your thing.

12:55.264 --> 12:58.034
Wait, I wanna show you.
No, it's just work! It's just work!

12:58.069 --> 12:59.546
Come here!

12:59.581 --> 13:02.208
Graham thinks I do that in the kitchen?

13:02.243 --> 13:05.712
I would never do... okay, once.

13:05.746 --> 13:07.480
<i>Good news, Annie...
everything we need to know</i>

13:07.515 --> 13:09.616
about Will and Trista is
on their wedding website.

13:09.650 --> 13:11.151
Do you think that
it would be too much

13:11.185 --> 13:13.019
to get a hold of the
priest that married them?

13:13.053 --> 13:15.688
Well, I would think that,
if I hadn't already done it.

13:15.723 --> 13:18.825
By the way, we're going to have
to get Graham baptized this Sunday.

13:18.859 --> 13:22.128
- Eh, wouldn't hurt him.
- Oh, hey, employee.

13:22.163 --> 13:25.465
I can't do lunch today because
I'm hanging with my new crew.

13:25.499 --> 13:27.548
- Mike?
- Doug is your crew?

13:27.583 --> 13:28.401
Yeah. D-money.

13:28.435 --> 13:30.336
Tell him that funny thing
you said the other day.

13:30.371 --> 13:32.305
- What funny thing?
- You know, that thing.

13:32.339 --> 13:35.542
Oh, you mean that joke about
the black guy and the latino guy,

13:35.576 --> 13:36.910
and they're trying to pick
the lock at the pearly gates.

13:36.944 --> 13:40.547
No, Doug.
I never heard that joke before.

13:40.581 --> 13:43.416
But now you're gonna
tell it to me in H.R.

13:43.450 --> 13:45.235
It's a funny joke.

13:45.236 --> 13:47.020
I love this neighborhood.

13:47.054 --> 13:50.156
I used to hang out here a
lot during my single days.

13:50.191 --> 13:52.425
Well, I wouldn't want
to be dating today, though.

13:52.459 --> 13:53.793
No, too much pressure,

13:53.828 --> 13:56.196
all those drug-resistant
venereal diseases,

13:56.230 --> 13:58.565
- craigslist murderers.
- Mike?

13:58.599 --> 14:00.567
Annie?
What are you doing here?

14:00.601 --> 14:04.971
What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?

14:05.005 --> 14:07.907
Well, I guess it's just
a coincidence, so whatever.

14:07.942 --> 14:12.078
- Hey, Will.
- Trista.

14:14.748 --> 14:17.083
If I can get a word in, um,

14:17.118 --> 14:18.751
what do you say, since
we're all together,

14:18.786 --> 14:20.920
the four of us have dinner somewhere?

14:20.955 --> 14:23.122
- Oh.
- M-maybe this place.

14:23.157 --> 14:25.425
Okay, that's crazy.

14:25.459 --> 14:27.961
This is where Trista
and I had our first date

14:27.995 --> 14:32.465
Soup of the day...
different soup every freaking day.

14:32.500 --> 14:35.291
That's... I mean,
that's... I got to see this.

14:35.326 --> 14:36.375
- Yeah.
- Oh, come on.

14:36.410 --> 14:38.695
We'll ignore them.
We'll get drunk.

14:38.967 --> 14:42.195
Wow. The hours just fly by
when you're writing.

14:42.229 --> 14:43.996
So, um...

14:44.031 --> 14:46.299
do you want to go get
something to eat or something?

14:46.333 --> 14:49.168
Uh, no, no, no.
I don't like to eat when I'm writing.

14:49.203 --> 14:52.839
I want the hunger in my belly
to just feed the hunger in my work.

14:52.873 --> 14:56.109
Oh, sure. Sure.
 Me too.

14:56.143 --> 15:01.280
Um, but I might just eat this
protein bar, since it's already open.

15:02.683 --> 15:06.986
Hey, Eve.
Oh, and it's Rain man.

15:07.020 --> 15:08.654
I'm Eve's aunt Leigh.

15:08.689 --> 15:11.224
Is this the one who sold
your baby clothes to buy drugs?

15:11.258 --> 15:15.561
- Uh... .
- Don't judge me.

15:15.596 --> 15:17.330
<i>You don't know what it's like.</i>

15:17.364 --> 15:20.166
Do you know how many onesies
you have to sell to get high?

15:20.200 --> 15:23.503
I don't because I was high.

15:23.537 --> 15:25.738
Oh, look how late it's getting.

15:25.773 --> 15:30.276
I should probably get out there
and sell my body for money. Bye.

15:30.310 --> 15:33.813
Oh, darn. She's going the wrong
way to the methadone clinic.

15:33.847 --> 15:36.416
Aunt Leigh, thank you so much.

15:36.450 --> 15:40.019
You're still not a badass,
but girls don't rat out other girls.

15:40.054 --> 15:42.755
You're the best.
No, you can't borrow any more money!

15:42.790 --> 15:43.856
It'll just go right up your nose!

15:43.891 --> 15:46.592
<i>- I love you.
- I love you too.</i>

15:46.627 --> 15:49.262
Man, it's like
nothing's changed here.

15:49.296 --> 15:52.065
That was the same
waiter from last time.

15:52.099 --> 15:55.201
He was old back then.

15:55.235 --> 15:58.071
- We found him at the retirement home.
- I had to promise him Willard Sscott

15:58.105 --> 16:01.307
would wish him a happy birthday,
even though he's only 85.

16:01.342 --> 16:03.076
Anyway, anything for Fiji.

16:03.110 --> 16:05.645
- Love.
- Love. Anything for love.

16:05.679 --> 16:07.647
Ah, this really brings me back.

16:07.681 --> 16:10.083
You know, people say
you can't live in the past,

16:10.117 --> 16:12.685
but I say indulge those
memories, you know,

16:12.719 --> 16:15.121
your first kiss, your first date,

16:15.155 --> 16:17.924
- not the stuff that comes after.
- Exactly.

16:17.958 --> 16:20.259
Change and growth...
those are the enemies.

16:20.294 --> 16:22.595
- Mm-hmm.
- You remember our first kiss, Will?

16:22.629 --> 16:25.965
- Of course. It was at the theater.
- During the blackout.

16:25.999 --> 16:28.368
<i>Honey, it was definitely at the play.</i>

16:28.402 --> 16:30.236
That Usher told us to get a room.

16:30.270 --> 16:33.039
I'm sure that was a fun
memory for you and whoever,

16:33.073 --> 16:36.509
- but I wasn't there.
- Well, I don't remember a blackout.

16:36.543 --> 16:38.644
Really? Because you
black out all the time.

16:38.679 --> 16:41.481
Four Scotches, hmm?
That's what you pair with salmon?

16:41.515 --> 16:44.050
Well, maybe I wouldn't have to drink
if you'd look at me when we make love.

16:44.084 --> 16:45.551
Whoa.

16:45.586 --> 16:47.153
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't...
don't fight.

16:47.187 --> 16:48.654
Your first kiss was on the ferry.

16:48.689 --> 16:50.857
Wait a minute.
How'd you know that?

16:50.891 --> 16:53.493
Because you... you told me...

16:53.527 --> 16:57.497
one time...
when you were drunk.

16:57.531 --> 16:58.831
<i>This is getting weird.</i>

16:58.866 --> 17:01.734
First, the chance meeting,
then the restaurant.

17:01.769 --> 17:04.303
<i>The waiter who's full-on asleep now.</i>

17:04.338 --> 17:07.906
<i>- What's going on here?
- Oh, my god. You're parent-trapping us.</i>

17:07.941 --> 17:09.008
I've never...
I've never seen the movie.

17:09.042 --> 17:12.244
- I don't know what that is.
- Ah, a dahlia for the pretty lady.

17:12.279 --> 17:14.012
Really? Dahlias?

17:14.048 --> 17:15.848
This guy just happens to be
selling our wedding flower?

17:15.883 --> 17:18.993
<i>All right, this is way too creepy.
I'm getting out of here.</i>

17:19.029 --> 17:21.253
Oh, don't you dare
leave me with these people.

17:21.288 --> 17:23.606
Well, if it isn't Will and Trista.

17:23.607 --> 17:28.560
I was just re-reading your vows
and thinking about how divorce is a sin.

17:28.595 --> 17:31.390
Stand down, father. Stand down.

17:32.619 --> 17:34.196
Have some salmon.

17:35.277 --> 17:38.020
<i>Will finally called back.
Good news... </i>

17:38.074 --> 17:40.351
The parent trap thing worked.
They're giving it another shot.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.550
That's wonderful. Should we
go upstairs and celebrate?

17:42.584 --> 17:43.884
Oh, no. No. They want
nothing to do with us.

17:43.919 --> 17:45.286
In fact, that's why he called back,

17:45.320 --> 17:47.121
to basically tell me
not to call anymore.

17:47.155 --> 17:48.756
You know why I think we went
after Will and Trista so hard?

17:48.790 --> 17:51.092
Because the kids are so
busy with their own lives,

17:51.126 --> 17:55.129
and we were looking for
someone else to fill that space.

17:55.563 --> 17:58.198
- I think it was Fiji.
- You're right. It was totally Fiji.

17:58.233 --> 18:01.902
- Want some cake?
- Oh, sure. Why not?

18:01.936 --> 18:04.805
- Okay, keep it still.
- Honey, that's not me. That's you.

18:04.839 --> 18:08.041
Oh, sorry.
Ah, even their cake is perfect.

18:08.076 --> 18:10.711
Graham, we need to talk.

18:12.547 --> 18:15.682
I have to explain to you about
what happened the other day.

18:15.717 --> 18:17.684
It's okay.
I know what you were doing.

18:17.719 --> 18:20.387
- You do?
- Yeah, and I think it's cool.

18:20.422 --> 18:22.322
Really?

18:22.357 --> 18:24.691
I mean, it's something I'd
like to do when I'm bigger.

18:24.726 --> 18:26.727
Well, that's natural.

18:26.761 --> 18:30.564
- And I'd like you to teach me.
- That's less natural.

18:30.598 --> 18:35.869
- Wait. What are you talking about?
- I was... what are you talking about?

18:36.905 --> 18:41.442
<i>I know your secret.
You're a spy.</i>

18:44.746 --> 18:47.014
<i>Well, don't tell anybody.</i>

18:47.048 --> 18:49.216
<i>Okay.</i>

18:50.318 --> 18:52.719
- So why do we have wedding cake?
- What do you care? It's free cake.

18:54.155 --> 18:55.756
This is the cake I want at my funeral.

18:57.792 --> 19:00.094
Andreas.
What are you doing here?

19:00.128 --> 19:03.230
Uh, you left your journal.
Your address is on the back.

19:03.264 --> 19:06.100
Oh! Good.
So you didn't have to look inside.

19:06.134 --> 19:09.203
- Okay, thanks.
- Whoa. Wait.

19:09.237 --> 19:13.106
This is your house?
I-I thought you said you lived in a bus.

19:13.141 --> 19:16.977
Yeah, well, we just got
into some subsidized housing.

19:17.011 --> 19:19.747
- With a doorman?
- Heavily subsidized.

19:19.781 --> 19:21.782
Um, but... but my family is still...

19:21.816 --> 19:23.383
very dysfunctional.

19:23.418 --> 19:26.220
<i>Evie, honey? Does your friend
want some cake and milk?</i>

19:26.254 --> 19:27.755
<i>It's really yummy.</i>

19:27.789 --> 19:30.224
<i>You're good? Okay.</i>

19:30.258 --> 19:31.992
So I may have bent the truth,

19:32.026 --> 19:35.295
but it's just because you're
so edgy and interesting,

19:35.330 --> 19:36.730
and I thought that
you wouldn't be into me

19:36.765 --> 19:39.633
if you saw how
boring all of this was.

19:39.667 --> 19:42.236
No, this isn't boring.
This is really nice.

19:42.270 --> 19:43.837
- I would love this.
- Really?

19:43.872 --> 19:46.940
So you still want to hang out with me?

19:46.975 --> 19:50.144
No. You've been lying
to me this whole time.

19:50.178 --> 19:53.013
It wasn't all lies!

19:53.047 --> 19:56.183
It was all lies. You can go.

19:56.217 --> 19:59.520
- You want to split this with me?
- You were right, Aunt Leigh.

19:59.554 --> 20:01.655
I can't pull off badass.

20:01.689 --> 20:03.524
It's not so much that
you can't pull it off.

20:03.558 --> 20:06.493
It's why would you want to?
It's not who you are.

20:06.528 --> 20:08.495
- Well, who am I?
- I don't know.

20:08.530 --> 20:11.999
But that's the best/worst
thing about being a teenager.

20:12.033 --> 20:14.968
You get to find out who you
are, and we get to live with it.

20:16.871 --> 20:19.807
It turns out it's not always
easy to be honest with people.

20:23.411 --> 20:27.014
<i>And it's even harder to
be honest with yourself</i>

20:27.048 --> 20:30.951
<i>about what you really want,</i>

20:30.985 --> 20:32.719
<i>what you really care about.</i>

20:32.754 --> 20:34.555
I knew you'd come back.

20:34.589 --> 20:38.457
I was gonna give you a half
a day of punishment, but...

20:39.761 --> 20:42.707
come here.

20:43.364 --> 20:45.833
Oh, Will never held me like this.

20:45.834 --> 20:48.786
But I guess figuring out
who you are and learning

20:48.787 --> 20:51.738
to be honest about that
is what makes you an adult.

20:51.773 --> 20:55.409
<i>Good luck with that.</i>

20:55.443 --> 20:57.411
<i>Oh, honey, look, new
Wi-Fi in the building!</i>

20:57.445 --> 21:00.247
<i>"Ready or yacht."
"Ready or yacht."</i>

21:00.281 --> 21:03.311
<i>How do we feel about boat people?</i>
