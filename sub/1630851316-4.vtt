WEBVTT

00:14.188 --> 00:16.538
KNIGHT:
Paul LeMere
is not a serial killer.

00:16.668 --> 00:20.498
He was a contract killer paid
to kill these seven people.

00:20.629 --> 00:22.326
The link's got to be
whoever hired LeMere.

00:22.457 --> 00:24.807
The money originated from one
of our contractor accounts.

00:24.937 --> 00:26.330
Sonova Industries.

00:26.461 --> 00:28.941
Sonova's main headquarters
are in Virginia,

00:29.072 --> 00:31.031
run by Sonia Eberhart.

00:31.161 --> 00:33.729
I didn't expect your
director to approve

00:33.859 --> 00:35.861
this little field trip.Agent Gibbs.

00:35.992 --> 00:37.950
Really looking forward
to spending some time together.

00:38.081 --> 00:39.300
You like fishing?

00:39.430 --> 00:41.737
There is a great place
in Naktok Bay.

00:41.867 --> 00:44.783
Naktok Bay
is a small fishing community

00:44.914 --> 00:46.829
in southwestern Alaska.
It's also where Sonova

00:46.959 --> 00:49.092
is currently building
a copper mine.

00:50.267 --> 00:52.661
Gibbs ditched me
and took LeMere.

01:01.800 --> 01:03.237
FBI!

01:03.367 --> 01:06.153
Leroy Jethro Gibbs, we have
a warrant for your arrest.

01:06.283 --> 01:07.850
Go.

01:12.463 --> 01:15.597
Gibbs? It's Agent Parker.

01:17.033 --> 01:18.469
Gibbs?

01:18.600 --> 01:20.428
AGENT:Clear!

01:29.393 --> 01:30.916
Gibbs?

01:31.874 --> 01:33.919
Let's not make this
any harder than...

01:44.887 --> 01:45.757
[phone rings]

01:45.888 --> 01:47.324
Special Agent McGee.

01:47.455 --> 01:48.369
Where is he?

01:48.499 --> 01:49.500
Who?

01:49.631 --> 01:50.632
Don't play games, McGee.

01:50.762 --> 01:52.112
Where the hell is Gibbs?

01:52.242 --> 01:54.114
Um, I don't know.
Did you try his cell?

01:54.244 --> 01:56.768
It's off.Check his house?

01:56.899 --> 01:58.553
Yeah, I did.

01:58.683 --> 02:01.077
Something tells me
he's not coming back.

02:03.819 --> 02:06.082
Well, I don't know.
But, uh, when I see him,

02:06.213 --> 02:08.911
I'll definitely let him know
that you're looking for him.

02:11.653 --> 02:13.307
Parker's looking for you.

02:13.437 --> 02:16.136
Grab your gear, McGee.
We got work to do.

02:25.362 --> 02:27.408
â™ª

02:55.827 --> 02:58.917
Last name Alonak. A-L-O-N-A-K.

02:59.048 --> 03:00.963
The reservation
will be under Sonia Eberhart

03:01.093 --> 03:02.530
or Sonova Industries.

03:02.660 --> 03:03.835
And what's the name of the boat?

03:03.966 --> 03:05.185
And when did she charter
the plane?

03:05.315 --> 03:07.056
Thank you.TORRES:Thanks.

03:09.711 --> 03:11.234
Oh, you go?No. You go.

03:11.365 --> 03:13.541
I know why the CEO of Sonova

03:13.671 --> 03:15.238
flew to Alaska.

03:15.369 --> 03:17.806
For a groundbreaking ceremony
for their copper mine.

03:17.936 --> 03:19.547
I thought they
were still waiting on approval.

03:19.677 --> 03:21.679
Well, the final construction
permit went through today.

03:21.810 --> 03:24.073
So, someone from Sonova
pays a hit man

03:24.204 --> 03:25.466
to kill people
opposed to their mine,

03:25.596 --> 03:26.989
and it still gets approved?

03:27.119 --> 03:29.861
[scoffs] Well, it has
to be the CEO, Eberhart.

03:29.992 --> 03:32.212
She had the most to lose
if the mine didn't get approved.

03:32.342 --> 03:34.257
It still doesn't prove
that she paid for those hits.

03:34.388 --> 03:36.868
We have to find a way to link
those payments back to her.

03:36.999 --> 03:39.175
Gibbs wanted to speak to
the father of the first victim.

03:39.306 --> 03:41.221
Maybe we'll get a lead from him?

03:41.351 --> 03:43.875
Libby Alonak. I tracked
down her dad, Tunu.

03:44.006 --> 03:46.313
He owns a fishing
boat in Naktok Bay.

03:46.443 --> 03:48.532
I'll call Gibbs and McGee.
What's the name of the boat?

03:48.663 --> 03:50.012
Cecilia.

03:57.149 --> 03:59.021
You see something, boss?

03:59.151 --> 04:01.502
Yeah. Hell of a boat.

04:01.632 --> 04:03.373
[chuckles]:
Yeah, right.

04:04.331 --> 04:07.116
Oh, no. You're serious.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.553
Well, yeah, I guess
it's still afloat.

04:13.992 --> 04:15.559
TUNU:
You know, Agent Gibbs,

04:15.690 --> 04:18.258
Libby warned me
this would happen.

04:18.388 --> 04:20.172
For two years, the
mainland police

04:20.303 --> 04:22.131
kept saying she
was just missing.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.525
I knew she had passed on.

04:24.655 --> 04:27.267
I felt it here.

04:29.138 --> 04:31.096
There was a hole.

04:31.227 --> 04:33.273
Emptiness.

04:35.187 --> 04:37.102
It won't go away.

04:37.233 --> 04:40.845
Yeah, you're right. The pain
never leaves your heart.

04:45.241 --> 04:47.461
But neither will she.

04:47.591 --> 04:49.854
You suffered such a loss?

04:52.857 --> 04:54.990
How did you get through the day?

04:57.253 --> 04:59.821
Some days, I don't.

05:01.997 --> 05:03.259
Mr. Alonak...

05:03.390 --> 05:05.653
Tunu. Please, call me Tunu.

05:05.783 --> 05:08.656
Tunu. You, uh, you said
that Libby told you

05:08.786 --> 05:10.266
that she was in danger?

05:10.397 --> 05:12.399
The last time we spoke,
she was pretty scared.

05:12.529 --> 05:14.966
Somebody threw a rock
through her window.

05:15.097 --> 05:16.751
Put a bullet in her mailbox.

05:16.881 --> 05:18.318
She know
who was threatening her?

05:18.448 --> 05:20.624
You've heard
of Sonova Industries?

05:20.755 --> 05:22.234
Yeah. We know
about the mine.

05:22.365 --> 05:24.846
That damn dirty mine
poisoning Naktok Bay.

05:24.976 --> 05:26.282
You think
Libby could've stopped it?

05:26.413 --> 05:28.632
I think her article could have.

05:29.633 --> 05:30.721
What article?

05:30.852 --> 05:32.244
You don't know?

05:33.507 --> 05:34.595
She wrote a piece

05:34.725 --> 05:35.900
exposing all of Sonova's lies,

05:36.031 --> 05:37.293
but she disappeared

05:37.424 --> 05:39.251
before it could
ever get published.

05:39.382 --> 05:40.818
What lies, exactly?

05:40.949 --> 05:43.125
About the toxic waste
that the mine

05:43.255 --> 05:45.040
was gonna dump
into the Miska River.

05:45.170 --> 05:46.781
It's the world's
last salmon run,

05:46.911 --> 05:49.305
and once that mine gets built,
there's gonna be none.

05:49.436 --> 05:52.569
And she promised me
once the article came out,

05:52.700 --> 05:55.267
Sonova would never get
the permits.

05:56.660 --> 05:59.315
You need to find
Libby's article.

05:59.446 --> 06:01.578
You'll see the truth.

06:01.709 --> 06:03.406
Libby's house was ransacked.

06:03.537 --> 06:06.757
Pretty safe bet that her killer
made that article disappear.

06:06.888 --> 06:08.237
No.

06:08.368 --> 06:09.760
My daughter was too clever.

06:09.891 --> 06:11.806
She would have kept that article
in a safe place.

06:11.936 --> 06:14.025
It's still out
there somewhere.

06:14.156 --> 06:16.071
I know it.

06:16.201 --> 06:17.812
My little Libby.

06:17.942 --> 06:19.901
Can you bring her home to me?

06:21.206 --> 06:24.471
She deserves a-a proper burial.

06:26.908 --> 06:28.910
[phone rings]

06:39.747 --> 06:42.402
[exhales]

06:45.143 --> 06:47.276
Director.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.147
You wanted to see me?

06:49.278 --> 06:51.585
You know, I figured you'd
want to talk to Gibbs.

06:51.715 --> 06:54.152
But you put a warrant out
for his arrest?

06:54.283 --> 06:56.764
No, actually, I didn't.
The Bureau did.

06:56.894 --> 06:58.156
I'm just following orders.

06:58.287 --> 06:59.897
He's a suspended agent

07:00.028 --> 07:01.725
who stole a government vehicle.You got to be kidding me.

07:01.856 --> 07:03.335
And kidnapped a suspect.

07:03.466 --> 07:05.337
Oh, come on, Parker.Who later died

07:05.468 --> 07:06.774
under mysterious circumstances.

07:06.904 --> 07:08.079
The guy blew himself up.

07:08.210 --> 07:10.299
And whose fault is that?

07:10.430 --> 07:11.953
You know,
this would be a lot easier

07:12.083 --> 07:14.521
if you just ordered Gibbs
to turn himself in.

07:14.651 --> 07:17.393
Gibbs is not an
active agent.

07:17.524 --> 07:18.655
Doesn't take orders
from me anymore.

07:18.786 --> 07:20.614
I can't order him
to do anything.

07:20.744 --> 07:22.137
Then call him as a friend

07:22.267 --> 07:24.879
and ask him
to get his ass out of hiding.

07:25.009 --> 07:26.446
Gibbs doesn't hide.

07:26.576 --> 07:27.621
Then where is he?

07:27.751 --> 07:29.753
[door bell jingles]

07:34.715 --> 07:36.194
Hello, Leon.

07:36.325 --> 07:38.370
Gibbs. How you doing?

07:38.501 --> 07:41.025
I'm headed to Alaska.Yeah.

07:42.026 --> 07:43.463
I know.

07:43.593 --> 07:46.291
Going to this little town
called...Ah.

07:46.422 --> 07:48.119
Ah, don't say another word.

07:48.250 --> 07:49.556
After what you did,

07:49.686 --> 07:51.819
taking off with the suspect
in Parker's car,

07:51.949 --> 07:54.169
the FBI's gonna want
to talk to you.

07:54.299 --> 07:56.606
And when they can't find you,
they will come to me,

07:56.737 --> 07:58.216
and I won't lie.

07:58.347 --> 07:59.957
I wouldn't want you to.

08:00.088 --> 08:01.829
Here.

08:01.959 --> 08:03.613
Brought you
something you could use

08:03.744 --> 08:05.572
for your trip up north.

08:07.835 --> 08:09.532
Satellite phone.

08:11.926 --> 08:13.231
Thank you.

08:13.362 --> 08:15.407
Really appreciate this.

08:16.931 --> 08:19.455
I could use one more thing.

08:20.456 --> 08:22.240
McGee.

08:22.371 --> 08:23.372
I know.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.548
He wouldn't fit in the bag.

08:25.679 --> 08:27.419
[laughs]

08:40.911 --> 08:42.478
[chuckles]

08:43.697 --> 08:46.917
Well, it had a good run.

08:49.703 --> 08:51.443
You okay?

08:51.574 --> 08:53.794
I wanted to say thank...

08:53.924 --> 08:55.578
[clears throat]

08:56.927 --> 09:00.061
I wanted to say thank you, Leon.

09:01.802 --> 09:03.717
For everything.

09:19.167 --> 09:21.256
Come on, give me something.

09:21.386 --> 09:23.040
He's in Alaska.

09:23.171 --> 09:25.913
Where in Alaska?He didn't say.

09:26.043 --> 09:28.611
Well, Alaska
doesn't really help me,

09:28.742 --> 09:30.352
does it, Director?
It's a pretty big place.

09:30.482 --> 09:32.049
Yeah, it's bigger
than most countries.

09:32.180 --> 09:33.398
Where's McGee?

09:33.529 --> 09:35.009
He's on personal leave.

09:35.139 --> 09:39.317
And I'm guessing this leave
happens to be in Alaska?

09:39.448 --> 09:41.058
Rumor had it
he was headed up that way.

09:41.189 --> 09:42.582
What are they doing there?

09:42.712 --> 09:44.975
Tracking down the suspect
in the serial murders.

09:45.106 --> 09:46.847
I thought
the suspect blew himself up.

09:46.977 --> 09:48.631
Not before he gave Gibbs a clue.

09:48.762 --> 09:49.806
What kind of clue?

09:49.937 --> 09:51.808
The kind
that takes you to Alaska.

09:57.292 --> 09:59.599
You know, I thought the
FBI was in the business

09:59.729 --> 10:02.036
of chasing actual criminals.
But hey,

10:02.166 --> 10:04.255
the minute Gibbs
gets back to D.C.,

10:04.386 --> 10:05.822
you can serve that warrant.

10:05.953 --> 10:08.738
Thanks for the advice,
but the FBI doesn't wait around.

10:08.869 --> 10:11.306
I'll go to Alaska
and bring him back myself.

10:12.263 --> 10:13.787
Good luck finding him.

10:21.621 --> 10:25.625
Our long wait is over!

10:27.017 --> 10:28.889
Underneath our feet

10:29.019 --> 10:32.501
lay millions of tons
of copper ore,

10:32.632 --> 10:34.198
and we will extract it,

10:34.329 --> 10:38.725
creating hundreds
of new jobs.

10:38.855 --> 10:40.465
[applause]Yes!

10:40.596 --> 10:42.903
[cheering, whooping]

10:46.210 --> 10:48.386
Let's dig this mine!

10:49.387 --> 10:50.824
Big day, huh?

10:50.954 --> 10:52.216
What a surprise.

10:52.347 --> 10:55.742
Uh, Special Agent McGee, right?

10:55.872 --> 10:57.091
And you are?

10:57.221 --> 10:58.135
Gibbs.

10:58.266 --> 10:59.484
Good to meet you, Gibbs.

10:59.615 --> 11:01.965
So, what brings
you fine gentlemen

11:02.096 --> 11:03.967
all the way up to Naktok Bay?

11:04.098 --> 11:05.665
We came to see you.

11:05.795 --> 11:07.971
Surprised you didn't tell
us about your Alaska visit

11:08.102 --> 11:11.758
last time we talked.I didn't realize I had to clear
my itinerary with NCIS.

11:11.888 --> 11:14.543
Well, you kind of do
when it includes breaking ground

11:14.674 --> 11:16.806
on a copper mine
that was only approved

11:16.937 --> 11:19.461
after four of its
biggest opponents were murdered.

11:19.591 --> 11:22.682
Like I said before,
it is horrible.

11:22.812 --> 11:24.335
But I still feel

11:24.466 --> 11:26.294
that it's nothing more
than a tragic coincidence.

11:26.424 --> 11:28.862
Libby Alonak's father
doesn't think that.

11:28.992 --> 11:30.733
And who is Libby Alonak?

11:30.864 --> 11:32.387
Libby was the first victim.

11:32.517 --> 11:33.997
She was writing an exposÃ©

11:34.128 --> 11:35.869
about how your copper mine
was gonna pollute the bay

11:35.999 --> 11:37.131
when she was killed.

11:37.261 --> 11:39.350
Well, she was wrong.

11:39.481 --> 11:41.962
We conducted an
environmental impact study

11:42.092 --> 11:43.528
that concludes our mine

11:43.659 --> 11:47.141
will have zero adverse effects
on the ecosystem.

11:47.271 --> 11:48.316
Can we see that study?

11:48.446 --> 11:50.579
Yes. It's public record.

11:50.710 --> 11:53.408
We had to submit it
to receive our permit.

11:53.538 --> 11:54.888
I am so sorry,

11:55.018 --> 11:56.280
but I really should
get back to my party.

11:56.411 --> 11:58.718
Are we done here?For now.

11:58.848 --> 12:00.415
Okay.

12:05.768 --> 12:08.118
Most people don't realize

12:08.249 --> 12:10.425
that the word is
inaccurate when describing

12:10.555 --> 12:12.514
Indigenous Alaskans.

12:12.644 --> 12:14.908
In fact, uh...

12:15.038 --> 12:16.518
Dr. Palmer.

12:16.648 --> 12:18.433
I don't mean to interrupt.

12:18.563 --> 12:20.914
What word are you
talking about?"Eskimo."

12:21.044 --> 12:23.264
Some people
find the word offensive.

12:23.394 --> 12:26.267
In fact, there are 28 categories

12:26.397 --> 12:29.487
of native Alaskan peoples.

12:29.618 --> 12:32.186
But I'm sure Miss
Alonak knew that.

12:32.316 --> 12:34.362
And why did you want to have
a chat with Libby here?

12:34.492 --> 12:36.799
Gibbs asked me to do
a psychological profile,

12:36.930 --> 12:39.106
so, naturally,
I wanted to meet her.

12:39.236 --> 12:42.109
You spoke with Gibbs?Mm-hmm.

12:42.239 --> 12:44.459
How is he holding up?
I've been worried about him.

12:44.589 --> 12:45.721
As have I.

12:45.852 --> 12:49.246
That's why I paid him a visit.

12:55.122 --> 12:56.645
Hey. Duck.

12:56.776 --> 12:59.256
Jethro. [chuckles]
Going on a trip?

12:59.387 --> 13:01.041
Yeah. Alaska.

13:01.171 --> 13:03.130
Fishing or business?

13:03.260 --> 13:04.784
Well, hopefully both.

13:04.914 --> 13:07.047
[chuckles] I like what
you've done to the place,

13:07.177 --> 13:09.136
especially the
basement. It...

13:09.266 --> 13:11.138
It's very, uh...

13:11.268 --> 13:13.009
airy.

13:13.140 --> 13:15.011
What can I do for you?

13:16.012 --> 13:17.884
I worry about you.

13:18.014 --> 13:20.712
Why?Well, you've had to
endure a great deal

13:20.843 --> 13:22.105
in the last six months.

13:22.236 --> 13:23.933
Sloane and Bishop leaving.

13:24.064 --> 13:26.806
The assault.
Your arrest and suspension.

13:26.936 --> 13:29.330
Not to mention the
blowing up of your boat.

13:29.460 --> 13:33.551
Milestone events such as these,

13:33.682 --> 13:35.945
they stack up on each other

13:36.076 --> 13:39.209
and build internal pressure.

13:39.340 --> 13:41.037
It happens to anyone.

13:43.039 --> 13:44.345
Even you.

13:45.563 --> 13:47.435
What do you want me to say?

13:47.565 --> 13:49.480
I want you to say,

13:49.611 --> 13:52.048
"There's nothing
to worry about, Duck."

13:52.179 --> 13:54.137
There's nothing
to worry about, Duck.

13:54.268 --> 13:56.183
I wish I believed you.

13:56.313 --> 13:58.402
I wish I believed me, too.

13:58.533 --> 14:00.143
Hmm.

14:01.579 --> 14:05.453
You're right. Uh, lately,
I've been searching.

14:05.583 --> 14:08.021
I don't know
what I'm looking for.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.328
I know

14:11.459 --> 14:15.115
being alone without the job,
that was hard.

14:15.245 --> 14:17.291
Then come back.

14:18.727 --> 14:20.294
That's even harder.

14:20.424 --> 14:23.253
Well, at least
we've completed step one:

14:23.384 --> 14:25.865
identify the problem.

14:25.995 --> 14:27.823
Duck, I got to go
to the airport.

14:27.954 --> 14:29.781
I'll give you a ride.

14:29.912 --> 14:31.827
I got a ride.

14:38.094 --> 14:40.444
[whispers]:
You are a great friend.

14:48.191 --> 14:51.673
I appreciate you
more than you know.

15:01.204 --> 15:03.032
[exhales]

15:03.163 --> 15:05.905
[door opens, closes]

15:06.993 --> 15:08.037
JIMMY:
And?

15:08.168 --> 15:09.821
Is Gibbs okay?

15:10.822 --> 15:12.912
He will be.
[chuckles softly]

15:13.042 --> 15:16.350
Does Libby here
have any personal effects?

15:16.480 --> 15:18.439
You talking
about her missing news article?

15:18.569 --> 15:20.397
Yeah, Torres filled me in.

15:20.528 --> 15:22.486
Apparently, they went back
and looked at Libby's place

15:22.617 --> 15:24.488
and still couldn't
find anything.

15:24.619 --> 15:26.229
Yet her father is convinced

15:26.360 --> 15:28.884
that she had a copy
hidden somewhere.

15:29.015 --> 15:31.017
Well, she certainly didn't
have it on her when she died.

15:31.147 --> 15:32.366
Her pockets were empty.

15:32.496 --> 15:34.411
No cell phone.
No USB drive.

15:34.542 --> 15:37.458
All she had was this
jewelry and this watch.

15:37.588 --> 15:39.199
Hmm.

15:39.329 --> 15:41.853
I'm really glad you went to
go see Gibbs, Dr. Mallard.

15:41.984 --> 15:46.075
Out of curiosity, how
did his basement look?

15:46.206 --> 15:49.296
[chuckles]
Like a war zone.

15:49.426 --> 15:52.560
Now, wait a minute.
Look. Look at this.

15:54.866 --> 15:56.607
That's a QR code.

15:56.738 --> 15:59.088
Her dad was right.
She was clever.

15:59.219 --> 16:01.656
She engraved it onto her watch.

16:01.786 --> 16:03.310
Does it link back
to her article?Yep.

16:03.440 --> 16:05.616
And?Oof. It's a doozy.

16:08.228 --> 16:10.926
KNIGHT:"Sonova's proposed
copper mine will poison

16:11.057 --> 16:13.450
Naktok Bay and destroy
its entire ecosystem."

16:13.581 --> 16:15.975
Gibbs should hear this.

16:17.454 --> 16:19.543
Already ahead of you.

16:19.674 --> 16:20.980
[phone rings]

16:21.110 --> 16:22.590
Yeah. Gibbs.

16:22.720 --> 16:24.331
KASIE:
We found Libby's article,

16:24.461 --> 16:25.810
and it claims Sonova's

16:25.941 --> 16:28.465
own internal environmental
impact report

16:28.596 --> 16:29.989
said the mine would have

16:30.119 --> 16:32.556
"unavoidable
catastrophic consequences

16:32.687 --> 16:34.428
to the water
and surrounding animal life."

16:34.558 --> 16:36.386
Eberhart just told us
the opposite.

16:36.517 --> 16:38.910
And the environmental
impact report Sonova

16:39.041 --> 16:40.695
filed publicly backs her up.

16:40.825 --> 16:43.306
Who's telling the truth?KASIE:
Libby claims Eberhart

16:43.437 --> 16:44.786
buried the original report,

16:44.916 --> 16:46.309
then bribed another biologist

16:46.440 --> 16:47.876
to get the results she needed.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.138
If this article
were published,

16:49.269 --> 16:50.966
Sonova would never
have gotten approval

16:51.097 --> 16:52.011
to build their mine.

16:52.141 --> 16:53.186
Libby have a source?

16:53.316 --> 16:55.318
Anonymous.Find 'em.

16:56.276 --> 16:58.017
Boss, what's going on?

16:58.147 --> 17:00.062
Take a good look around, McGee.

17:01.107 --> 17:02.717
If Libby Alonak's right,

17:02.847 --> 17:04.936
this will be gone soon.

17:05.937 --> 17:07.156
Which part?

17:08.157 --> 17:09.898
All of it.

17:24.347 --> 17:26.175
Libby Alonak wrote
a tell-all article

17:26.306 --> 17:28.003
on Sonova's copper mine.

17:28.134 --> 17:30.919
TORRES:
But she was killed before
the article was published.

17:31.050 --> 17:33.835
Lucky for Sonova. Did
Libby's article check out?

17:33.965 --> 17:35.097
We don't know yet.
All of her intel

17:35.228 --> 17:36.403
came from one single source.

17:36.533 --> 17:37.534
An anonymous source.

17:37.665 --> 17:39.362
KASIE:
Anonymous no more.

17:39.493 --> 17:42.452
When I dug further into the file
linked to the watch's QR code,

17:42.583 --> 17:46.021
I found Libby's personal notes,
which revealed her source.

17:47.414 --> 17:48.328
Brian Stafford.

17:48.458 --> 17:49.764
Isn't he one of the victims?

17:49.894 --> 17:51.505
The research biologist.

17:51.635 --> 17:54.029
KNIGHT:Obviously, Sonova didn't
like his research.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.118
They made his report disappear
and him, too.

17:56.249 --> 17:59.513
Well, we can't prove any of this
unless we find that report.

17:59.643 --> 18:01.993
Our best bet is to get our hands
on Brian Stafford's files.

18:02.124 --> 18:03.343
He had a wife.

18:03.473 --> 18:05.084
Melanie, I think.

18:05.214 --> 18:07.564
She may know where they are.Do you have
her contact info?

18:07.695 --> 18:10.872
No, but I know
someone who does.

18:11.002 --> 18:12.613
PHIL:
A contract killer?

18:12.743 --> 18:14.136
NCIS is sure?

18:14.267 --> 18:15.529
They followed the money.

18:15.659 --> 18:17.096
I don't get it.
Why would anyone pay

18:17.226 --> 18:19.489
to have my husband killed?Yeah, or my wife?

18:19.620 --> 18:21.317
I mean, Jen didn't
have any enemies.

18:21.448 --> 18:23.493
NINA:
So, if this contract killer
is dead,

18:23.624 --> 18:25.887
did any chance of solving
this case die with him?

18:26.017 --> 18:27.758
No, ma'am.

18:27.889 --> 18:29.412
We will make sure
that we find

18:29.543 --> 18:31.936
whoever was responsible
for this, I give you my word.

18:32.067 --> 18:34.200
Everyone, this is Agent Torres.

18:35.375 --> 18:37.246
Melanie. Brian's laptop?

18:37.377 --> 18:39.727
If he has any research,
this is where it would be.

18:39.857 --> 18:42.208
I will make sure that you get
everything back intact.

18:42.338 --> 18:45.689
I really hope you guys find
what you're looking for.

18:45.820 --> 18:47.735
Me, too.

18:47.865 --> 18:48.997
Uh, thank you

18:49.128 --> 18:51.130
for your help, Marcie.Sure.

18:52.740 --> 18:54.611
Nick...

18:54.742 --> 18:56.961
what's up with Gibbs?

18:57.092 --> 18:58.963
I-Is he okay?

19:01.009 --> 19:03.403
What about McGee?

19:03.533 --> 19:06.406
Oh, he's already
at the airport.

19:11.237 --> 19:13.152
Hey, just for the
record, I always knew

19:13.282 --> 19:15.719
how you were gonna get that
boat out of the basement.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.419
I didn't know
it was a question.What?

19:19.549 --> 19:21.029
Burning. For years.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.596
All right? I knew about
you and that damn boat

19:22.726 --> 19:24.163
before I
transferred to D.C.

19:24.293 --> 19:26.339
How the hell else
was I gonna get that thing out?

19:26.469 --> 19:28.123
Hey, trust me, that's
what I said, okay?

19:28.254 --> 19:31.170
But the theories I heard
were nuts. I'm talking

19:31.300 --> 19:34.173
about moveable walls,
uh, pulley systems.Yeah.

19:34.303 --> 19:35.913
Because your house
has a coal tunnel

19:36.044 --> 19:37.785
underneath, they...
I guess possibly

19:37.915 --> 19:41.049
you can turn the
boat on its side.Geez. Torres, come on.

19:43.747 --> 19:47.403
Did you get an address
for Libby Alonak's father?

19:47.534 --> 19:50.101
Not yet. Uh, the town
that you're going to

19:50.232 --> 19:52.756
is so off the grid that
there are no addresses.

19:52.887 --> 19:54.932
Uh, but Knight is on it.

19:55.063 --> 19:57.239
She's good, huh?

19:57.370 --> 19:59.285
She's smart.

19:59.415 --> 20:01.939
You know, she stepped
into a tough situation...

20:02.940 --> 20:04.464
...and handled it well.

20:07.031 --> 20:09.904
What about you?What about me?

20:10.034 --> 20:12.559
How are you?

20:13.603 --> 20:15.431
Oh, I'm doing good.[chuckling]

20:15.562 --> 20:17.607
Come on, the truth.

20:17.738 --> 20:21.045
I am getting by.

20:21.176 --> 20:23.657
Some days are
better than others.

20:26.529 --> 20:28.531
But I'll be fine.

20:30.533 --> 20:33.406
You are a hell of an agent,
Nick.

20:34.624 --> 20:37.627
You got instincts
that don't come along often.

20:39.150 --> 20:40.761
More important...

20:42.023 --> 20:44.025
You are a good man.

20:45.766 --> 20:48.072
Do me a favor, though.

20:49.335 --> 20:52.947
You don't let this job
become all that there is.

20:54.514 --> 20:56.385
You take care of you.

20:56.516 --> 20:58.387
Now.

21:01.129 --> 21:02.739
What?

21:03.740 --> 21:05.351
What about you, Gibbs?

21:05.481 --> 21:08.136
Are you good?

21:09.746 --> 21:13.141
I mean, considering the fact
that your beloved boat blew up,

21:13.272 --> 21:14.838
your house is
missing a wall and,

21:14.969 --> 21:17.450
well, you're
also unemployed.

21:19.452 --> 21:21.149
I'll be fine.

21:22.106 --> 21:24.370
I know you will.

21:27.721 --> 21:31.115
Yeah. He's okay.

21:34.771 --> 21:35.903
[Kasie groans]

21:36.033 --> 21:36.904
Damn it.

21:37.034 --> 21:38.340
That doesn't sound good.

21:38.471 --> 21:40.342
Stafford's report
not on his laptop?

21:40.473 --> 21:41.865
I wouldn't know. I'm locked out.

21:41.996 --> 21:43.737
This bad boy's
password-protected.

21:43.867 --> 21:46.087
Can't we get the password
from his wife?No, she said her husband

21:46.217 --> 21:48.481
never gave it to her. She
sent me half a dozen guesses,

21:48.611 --> 21:50.004
but none worked,

21:50.134 --> 21:51.745
so I guess I'll have
to hack my way in.

21:51.875 --> 21:53.747
Which might take a while.

21:54.835 --> 21:57.054
How long?Uh, depends on
how secure...

21:57.185 --> 21:58.534
No, how long
have they been married?

21:58.665 --> 22:00.144
Why does it matter?

22:00.275 --> 22:02.538
Oh, I just think it's strange
that, you know,

22:02.669 --> 22:05.106
her husband didn't give her
the password.

22:05.236 --> 22:07.413
Not to me.If you were married,

22:07.543 --> 22:08.936
you wouldn't give your husband
your password?

22:09.066 --> 22:11.895
[chuckles]:
Not a chance.

22:13.201 --> 22:14.245
Why? Would you?

22:14.376 --> 22:15.508
Why would I share a bank account

22:15.638 --> 22:16.813
and not my computer?

22:16.944 --> 22:18.511
Who says I'm sharing
my bank account?

22:18.641 --> 22:20.600
This is your soul mate
we're talking about.

22:20.730 --> 22:22.906
Even still, way too intimate.

22:23.037 --> 22:24.734
I think you have
some real trust issues

22:24.865 --> 22:26.475
with your hypothetical husband.

22:26.606 --> 22:29.826
Don't play armchair psychiatrist
for my make-believe marriage.

22:29.957 --> 22:31.350
We are happy.Oh.

22:31.480 --> 22:34.004
Doing it our way.[Kasie clears throat]

22:34.135 --> 22:36.398
KASIE:Sorry to interrupt
whatever this is.

22:36.529 --> 22:38.357
But look.TORRES:
You hacked in?

22:38.487 --> 22:41.664
Yes, Nick, but that is old news.
Look what I found.

22:43.013 --> 22:45.059
Stafford's
environmental impact report.

22:45.189 --> 22:47.409
KASIE:
The copper mine will result

22:47.540 --> 22:49.585
in "unavoidable
catastrophic consequences

22:49.716 --> 22:52.196
to the water
and surrounding animal life."

22:54.242 --> 22:55.635
And look who signed it.

22:55.765 --> 22:57.463
Sonia Eberhart.

22:59.421 --> 23:01.597
All right, thanks, Nick.

23:01.728 --> 23:05.340
Boss, everything Libby Alonak
wrote about the mine is true.

23:05.471 --> 23:07.168
Time to pay Eberhart a visit.

23:07.298 --> 23:10.301
She's scheduled to make a flight
to Costa Rica tonight

23:10.432 --> 23:12.347
when she's wrapped up
her little media tour.

23:12.478 --> 23:14.262
Gonna miss her flight.

23:16.569 --> 23:17.874
Hey, fellas.

23:18.875 --> 23:19.963
Parker?

23:21.835 --> 23:23.489
What the hell are
you doing here?

23:23.619 --> 23:25.099
Arresting a fugitive.

23:25.229 --> 23:27.667
Which you are currently
harboring, by the way.

23:27.797 --> 23:29.582
You want to do the deed,

23:29.712 --> 23:31.410
or should I?

23:32.367 --> 23:33.934
Okay, then.

23:34.064 --> 23:35.979
Allow me.

23:36.110 --> 23:37.416
You flew all the way to Alaska

23:37.546 --> 23:39.679
to arrest Gibbs
for-for taking a joyride?

23:39.809 --> 23:41.768
He kidnapped a suspect.
At the Bureau,

23:41.898 --> 23:43.726
we call that
obstruction of justice.

23:43.857 --> 23:45.206
We're in the
middle of nowhere.

23:45.336 --> 23:46.425
There's no way you
could have tracked us.

23:46.555 --> 23:48.078
You're right. I had help.

23:48.209 --> 23:50.211
Who told you where to find us?

23:50.341 --> 23:52.431
He did.

24:05.095 --> 24:07.010
McGEE:You told Parker
where we are?

24:07.141 --> 24:08.185
Why?

24:08.316 --> 24:09.970
Because it's the right thing.

24:10.100 --> 24:11.711
FBI's got a warrant out
for me.

24:11.841 --> 24:13.364
I don't want him
to think I'm running.

24:13.495 --> 24:14.931
What about the investigation?

24:15.062 --> 24:16.367
What about stopping the mine?Well, I didn't think

24:16.498 --> 24:18.544
he was gonna fly 4,000 miles
to get me.

24:18.674 --> 24:20.720
[exhales]
Well, he did.I can see that.

24:20.850 --> 24:22.330
So, what do we do now?

24:22.461 --> 24:24.288
Talk to him.Yeah, I got it.

24:24.419 --> 24:25.855
Talk to him?

24:25.986 --> 24:27.988
You don't think
you've told him enough, boss?

24:28.118 --> 24:30.730
Do I sense some dissension
in the ranks?

24:30.860 --> 24:33.080
Parker, please don't do this.

24:33.210 --> 24:35.735
We're booked
on the 5:15 out of Nanook.

24:38.085 --> 24:40.479
You can't arrest Gibbs now.
We-we just found out

24:40.609 --> 24:42.698
who was responsible for paying
for the serial killings.

24:42.829 --> 24:45.484
Yeah? Who's that?Sonia Eberhart.

24:45.614 --> 24:47.877
The CEO of Sonova?
You got proof?

24:48.008 --> 24:49.836
We have proof that she lied
to protect the mine.

24:49.966 --> 24:51.054
Doesn't make her a killer.

24:51.185 --> 24:53.100
Does give her
a hell of a motive.

24:53.230 --> 24:56.190
We take her down, we can stop
the mine from being built.

24:56.320 --> 24:59.149
Or you can let all
this be destroyed.

24:59.280 --> 25:02.501
Wow, did you two rehearse that?[sighs]

25:02.631 --> 25:04.764
Parker, come on.
This is your case, too.

25:04.894 --> 25:05.982
I know that you care.

25:06.113 --> 25:07.941
So, now you want
to be a team again?

25:08.071 --> 25:09.725
Kumbaya?

25:09.856 --> 25:11.248
That's convenient.

25:11.379 --> 25:13.468
Victims' families
need answers.

25:13.599 --> 25:17.516
The people of Naktok Bay
deserve to keep what's theirs.

25:21.520 --> 25:24.218
You two really think
out here by yourselves

25:24.348 --> 25:27.526
you can go up against
a billion-dollar corporation

25:27.656 --> 25:29.353
and win?GIBBS:Yeah.

25:29.484 --> 25:31.268
We do.

25:31.399 --> 25:33.357
Job's not done.

25:41.409 --> 25:43.367
Let's make one thing clear.

25:43.498 --> 25:45.674
As soon as Eberhart
is in custody,

25:45.805 --> 25:47.589
your ass belongs to me.

25:47.720 --> 25:48.938
Got it?

25:50.810 --> 25:53.203
Let's finish the job.

25:56.642 --> 25:57.947
KNIGHT:
We've got Eberhart
dead to rights

25:58.078 --> 25:59.601
on burying Stafford's report,

25:59.732 --> 26:02.256
but I can't tie her
to the money paid to LeMere.

26:02.386 --> 26:03.474
So, what are you thinking?

26:03.605 --> 26:05.651
I'm thinking she had a partner.

26:05.781 --> 26:07.130
Funneled the money through them.

26:07.261 --> 26:08.828
Think it was
someone else at Sonova?

26:08.958 --> 26:11.178
Possibly. But could be anyone.

26:11.308 --> 26:13.310
Hired gun. Stockholder.

26:13.441 --> 26:17.010
Or just someone who has a lot
to gain seeing that mine built.

26:17.140 --> 26:18.577
I think we get

26:18.707 --> 26:20.448
Eberhart to flip on her partner.

26:20.579 --> 26:21.971
How?

26:22.102 --> 26:24.452
Easy.
You get Gibbs to arrest her,

26:24.583 --> 26:26.149
he floats your
partner theory,

26:26.280 --> 26:28.717
and she folds
under Gibbs' pressure.

26:28.848 --> 26:31.241
I think that would work
on most criminals,

26:31.372 --> 26:32.895
but I don't think she's gonna
buckle under the pressure.

26:33.026 --> 26:34.593
Even from Gibbs.

26:34.723 --> 26:36.333
Well, then...

26:37.596 --> 26:39.249
We get her to talk another way.

26:40.686 --> 26:42.296
[eagle screeching]

26:42.426 --> 26:44.777
[phone rings]

26:50.739 --> 26:52.088
Chief.

26:52.219 --> 26:55.048
Parker. You're a hard guy
to get ahold of.

26:55.178 --> 26:56.745
Yeah, well, I've been busy.

26:56.876 --> 26:58.051
Does that mean you got your man?

26:58.181 --> 26:59.879
I caught a break
on the Sonova case,

27:00.009 --> 27:02.708
so I decided to deprioritize
Gibbs' arrest for the moment.

27:02.838 --> 27:04.318
Glad you got a new lead,

27:04.448 --> 27:06.668
but remember, we sent you
up there for a reason.

27:06.799 --> 27:08.452
So, you're saying
the arrest of one man

27:08.583 --> 27:10.454
on an obstruction charge
is more important

27:10.585 --> 27:13.240
than taking down the person
who ordered eight murders?

27:13.370 --> 27:15.459
No, of course not.

27:15.590 --> 27:17.636
I'm simply reminding you
of the importance

27:17.766 --> 27:20.160
of doing the job
you were assigned.

27:20.290 --> 27:23.729
All due respect, Chief, uh,
why is the FBI so hell-bent

27:23.859 --> 27:25.382
on taking Gibbs down?

27:25.513 --> 27:27.689
Why? He kidnapped your suspect

27:27.820 --> 27:29.517
and made us look like fools.

27:29.648 --> 27:30.910
He's a good agent.

27:31.040 --> 27:32.563
Do you know
what he was suspended for?

27:33.564 --> 27:34.870
Yeah.

27:35.001 --> 27:36.655
Well, the list
goes on and on from there.

27:36.785 --> 27:39.309
And yet time and time again,
Gibbs has managed to avoid

27:39.440 --> 27:40.659
paying the price
for his actions.

27:40.789 --> 27:42.182
That ends today.

27:42.312 --> 27:44.663
Let me know when you have him.

27:47.187 --> 27:48.710
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Flight 871 is scheduled

27:48.841 --> 27:51.670
for an on-time departure
from Gate 15-A.

27:51.800 --> 27:54.194
Leaving so soon?
You just got here.

27:54.324 --> 27:56.152
Uh, I know. Quick trip.

27:56.283 --> 27:57.806
Sorry to have to run,

27:57.937 --> 27:59.721
but I have a flight to catch
and a car waiting for me.

27:59.852 --> 28:02.898
You, uh, you maybe want to go,
like, fishing before you go?

28:03.029 --> 28:05.031
I don't fish.GIBBS:
Right.

28:05.161 --> 28:07.903
You just poison everything.I already told you

28:08.034 --> 28:11.907
to look into our
environmental impact statement.We did.

28:12.038 --> 28:14.127
And we also saw the real one,
the one you buried.

28:14.257 --> 28:15.563
And don't pretend
you don't know about it,

28:15.694 --> 28:17.043
because you signed it.

28:17.173 --> 28:18.740
[exhales]

28:18.871 --> 28:20.394
I sign lots of reports.

28:20.524 --> 28:22.091
[phone rings]Yeah, well,
this particular report

28:22.222 --> 28:24.964
details how your mine
was gonna pollute Naktok Bay,

28:25.094 --> 28:26.530
so you got rid of it.

28:26.661 --> 28:28.228
Just like you got rid...Yeah?

28:28.358 --> 28:30.578
...of Brian Stafford and you
got rid of Libby Alonak.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.275
I want to call my lawyer.That's a good idea,

28:32.406 --> 28:34.364
'cause you're under arrest.
Hands behind your back.

28:34.495 --> 28:36.671
Hold on. McGee, stop.What?

28:36.802 --> 28:40.196
Director Vance called,
told us to stand down.

28:42.329 --> 28:44.157
Bureaucratic red tape.

28:44.287 --> 28:45.767
So, am I free to go?

28:45.898 --> 28:47.160
For now.

28:47.290 --> 28:49.075
Excuse me.

28:52.382 --> 28:54.428
[chain saw whirring]

28:58.824 --> 29:00.434
Let's go!

29:09.704 --> 29:11.837
[line beeping]

29:11.967 --> 29:14.753
Excuse me,
do you have cell service?

29:14.883 --> 29:16.363
PARKER:
You betcha.

29:16.493 --> 29:18.060
Well, my call
is not going through.

29:18.191 --> 29:20.759
Well, it might be the spotty
reception, or it might be

29:20.889 --> 29:24.371
this, uh, cell phone jammer
I'm using to block your call.

29:24.501 --> 29:25.764
What the hell are you doing?

29:25.894 --> 29:27.766
Arresting you.

29:29.245 --> 29:32.205
Special Agent Alden Parker. FBI.

29:34.816 --> 29:36.687
Now we get to see
who you tried to call.

29:36.818 --> 29:37.950
Fingers crossed.

29:38.080 --> 29:39.778
I'm really hoping
it's your partner.

29:39.908 --> 29:41.518
MARCIE:
I appreciate
you coming back over

29:41.649 --> 29:43.216
on such short notice, Phil.

29:43.346 --> 29:44.913
No, are you kidding?
Any break in the case

29:45.044 --> 29:46.523
is worth
dropping everything for.

29:46.654 --> 29:48.917
Uh, so, what'd
you find out?

29:49.048 --> 29:50.701
Well,

29:50.832 --> 29:54.575
what all the murders
seem to have in common.

29:56.142 --> 29:59.188
A copper mine in Alaska.A mine?

29:59.319 --> 30:01.843
Yeah. I discovered that Sonova

30:01.974 --> 30:05.020
has been trying
to build this mine for years

30:05.151 --> 30:06.805
and has been killing people

30:06.935 --> 30:09.242
who are trying to block
its construction.

30:09.372 --> 30:10.809
Wait, sorry.
I-I don't understand

30:10.939 --> 30:12.811
what any of this
has to do with my wife.

30:12.941 --> 30:15.117
As far as I-I can tell, nothing.

30:15.248 --> 30:17.990
Which is why I called you here.

30:18.120 --> 30:19.513
Hoping that maybe

30:19.643 --> 30:21.689
you might know something
about Sonova.

30:21.820 --> 30:23.996
No. Uh, um,

30:24.126 --> 30:26.172
have you mentioned any of this
to the Feds yet?

30:26.302 --> 30:27.738
No, not yet.

30:27.869 --> 30:30.524
I'm still trying
to piece everything together.

30:30.654 --> 30:32.439
[breathes deeply]

30:32.569 --> 30:34.702
You should have
just let this go, Marcie.

30:35.703 --> 30:37.574
[chuckles]:
Why, Phil?

30:37.705 --> 30:39.185
You upset
because you're gonna have

30:39.315 --> 30:41.448
to do your own wet work
for once?

30:41.578 --> 30:44.538
You bitch.Yeah.

30:44.668 --> 30:46.540
TORRES:Phil Hanover,
you're under arrest!

30:46.670 --> 30:47.715
Do not move!

30:47.846 --> 30:49.499
Okay, I know
what you think.

30:49.630 --> 30:51.197
I did not have anyone killed.

30:51.327 --> 30:53.329
Then why would Sonia
Eberhart try calling you?

30:53.460 --> 30:55.114
Sonia Eber...
I don't even know who that is.

30:55.244 --> 30:56.593
TORRES:
Your phone records say you do.

30:56.724 --> 30:58.639
We found out you have land
in Naktok Bay.

30:58.769 --> 31:00.249
A lot of it.
In the same place

31:00.380 --> 31:01.816
where Sonova's
building their mine.

31:01.947 --> 31:04.471
Eberhart offered you millions
to buy your land.

31:04.601 --> 31:06.038
One condition.

31:06.168 --> 31:08.736
Sonova needed their
opposition out of the way.

31:08.867 --> 31:11.782
And that's where the hit man
you hired entered the picture.

31:11.913 --> 31:14.307
So, when your wife found
out about your little plan,

31:14.437 --> 31:16.439
well, you had her killed, too.

31:17.440 --> 31:19.181
I want my lawyer.

31:20.269 --> 31:23.794
This is why I don't trust
my hypothetical husband.

31:26.362 --> 31:27.407
[exhales]

31:27.537 --> 31:28.756
You good?

31:28.887 --> 31:31.280
Yeah, I'm-I'm great.

31:31.411 --> 31:33.021
Well, what you did was brave.

31:33.152 --> 31:35.719
Libby Alonak was brave.

31:37.765 --> 31:39.245
Great, thanks.

31:39.375 --> 31:41.725
Parker has Eberhart
in custody.

31:41.856 --> 31:44.293
I just talked to Torres.
Hanover fell right in the trap.

31:44.424 --> 31:47.035
Marcie?Marcie's good. Better than good.

31:47.166 --> 31:48.863
Nick actually said
she was incredible.

31:48.994 --> 31:50.996
Man, she just wrote herself

31:51.126 --> 31:53.520
one hell of an ending,
don't you think?

31:57.002 --> 32:00.483
How many cases
you think I've worked, huh?

32:00.614 --> 32:03.312
Ooh. In 25 years?

32:03.443 --> 32:06.141
At least a thousand,
I'm sure. Why?

32:06.272 --> 32:08.927
Because what we did today,
saving this land,

32:09.057 --> 32:11.799
may be the most meaningful one
of all of them.

32:11.930 --> 32:13.627
We did something good here,
didn't we?

32:13.757 --> 32:15.585
Should be proud, Tim.

32:15.716 --> 32:17.587
I am.Good.

32:17.718 --> 32:18.588
All right, what now?

32:18.719 --> 32:20.721
Now you arrest me.

32:20.851 --> 32:24.333
Wait, no. Boss, it's ridiculous.
Let Parker do it.

32:24.464 --> 32:25.944
No. Tim, it's got to be you.

32:26.074 --> 32:28.120
You are a federal officer.
I'm a fugitive.

32:28.250 --> 32:29.730
They cannot hit you
with a harboring charge.

32:29.860 --> 32:31.079
Boss, I don't care.

32:31.210 --> 32:33.429
I do care. Tim, arrest me.What?

32:33.560 --> 32:35.562
Do your job.

32:35.692 --> 32:37.216
Come on!

32:38.521 --> 32:41.350
[quietly]:
All right. Okay.

32:43.744 --> 32:45.093
[grunts]

32:54.146 --> 32:55.799
[eagle screeching]

33:18.605 --> 33:20.259
I hate this, you know.

33:20.389 --> 33:22.087
You're doing fine.

33:22.217 --> 33:24.002
Nice work today.

33:24.132 --> 33:26.656
Eberhart got spooked,
just like you said.

33:26.787 --> 33:30.878
Tell your boss Special Agent
McGee turned me in to the FBI.

33:31.009 --> 33:32.836
He shouldn't be
caught up in this.

33:32.967 --> 33:34.186
He won't be.

33:34.316 --> 33:35.926
Well, neither should Gibbs.

33:36.057 --> 33:37.667
This obstruction charge
is a joke.

33:37.798 --> 33:40.366
Well, according to my boss,
it's the only way

33:40.496 --> 33:43.195
they can finally
take you down.What do you mean, "finally"?

33:43.325 --> 33:47.025
Seems you have a history
of coloring outside the lines.

33:47.155 --> 33:50.115
But so do I on occasion.

33:51.116 --> 33:53.553
McGee, key.

34:00.908 --> 34:03.171
[exhales]

34:03.302 --> 34:04.520
Wait,
what's happening right now?

34:04.651 --> 34:06.261
I'm not gonna be
the FBI's errand boy.

34:06.392 --> 34:08.046
After I talked to my boss,

34:08.176 --> 34:09.569
I did a little research
on you.

34:09.699 --> 34:12.093
I called
an old coworker, and, uh,

34:12.224 --> 34:14.965
let's just say
he convinced me

34:15.096 --> 34:16.880
that you don't belong
behind bars.

34:17.011 --> 34:19.579
Won't the FBI just send
another agent to arrest him?

34:19.709 --> 34:21.798
If I don't testify
that Gibbs stole my vehicle,

34:21.929 --> 34:23.844
they don't have a case.

34:25.324 --> 34:27.152
You could lose your badge.

34:27.282 --> 34:28.805
Maybe.

34:28.936 --> 34:30.416
You sure about this?

34:30.546 --> 34:32.418
No.

34:36.117 --> 34:37.597
You boys have

34:37.727 --> 34:38.946
a safe flight home.

34:39.903 --> 34:43.168
Parker, who was the coworker

34:43.298 --> 34:44.517
you called?

34:44.647 --> 34:47.302
Tobias Fornell.

34:51.828 --> 34:54.701
Parker. Thanks.

35:14.634 --> 35:16.679
Permission to come aboard?

35:16.810 --> 35:18.159
Please.

35:20.596 --> 35:23.121
Thank you for bringing
my daughter home to me.

35:23.251 --> 35:25.558
Now I can properly honor
her memory.

35:25.688 --> 35:27.821
I'm having
a traditional potlatch ceremony

35:27.951 --> 35:29.083
for Libby today.

35:29.214 --> 35:31.477
It would be my great honor...

35:32.478 --> 35:34.436
...to present you with this.

35:34.567 --> 35:37.396
Oh. No.
[chuckles]

35:37.526 --> 35:40.007
Thank you, but I can't...
I can't accept.

35:40.138 --> 35:42.401
You must. It's our tradition
during a potlatch

35:42.531 --> 35:44.446
to give away
our personal wealth.

35:47.884 --> 35:49.321
Okay.

35:49.451 --> 35:52.324
Tunu, thank you.Mm-hmm.

35:52.454 --> 35:54.456
Thank you.

35:55.414 --> 35:56.676
Springfield.

35:56.806 --> 35:59.505
It's a relic, but it
still gets the job done.

35:59.635 --> 36:00.549
Do you shoot?

36:00.680 --> 36:02.160
Once or twice.

36:03.857 --> 36:06.164
Got something for you, too.

36:10.951 --> 36:12.257
Libby's watch.

36:12.387 --> 36:14.955
I noticed it was a man's watch.

36:15.085 --> 36:16.739
It your watch?

36:16.870 --> 36:20.656
I gave it to her
the day she left our village.

36:20.787 --> 36:23.616
She once said to me

36:23.746 --> 36:26.227
this was the wrong mine
in the wrong place.

36:26.358 --> 36:29.012
And to find out
she helped stop it

36:29.143 --> 36:30.710
and save our precious land,

36:30.840 --> 36:34.192
I've never been prouder
to be her father.

36:35.236 --> 36:37.195
You-you should be proud.

36:37.325 --> 36:40.415
I realized something when
I was fishing this morning.

36:40.546 --> 36:43.853
Libby lives on in nature.

36:43.984 --> 36:46.682
I hear her voice in the wind,

36:46.813 --> 36:49.903
and I feel her soul
in the water.

36:50.033 --> 36:52.688
It is true what you said.

36:52.819 --> 36:56.083
She will always be with me.

37:09.966 --> 37:12.142
Yeah, you're
getting there, McGee.

37:12.273 --> 37:14.319
Just got to find
your rhythm.

37:17.322 --> 37:19.062
Your rhythm, not mine.

37:19.193 --> 37:21.674
Not so sure
the fish like my rhythm.

37:21.804 --> 37:25.243
I think the fish know
you haven't found it yet.

37:26.809 --> 37:28.246
Be patient.

37:28.376 --> 37:30.509
It's about progress,
not perfection.

37:30.639 --> 37:33.338
Once you know the basics...

37:34.339 --> 37:37.255
...the rest just comes
from inside.

37:37.385 --> 37:39.257
Like tap-dancing.

37:39.387 --> 37:41.389
[chuckles]
Okay.

37:41.520 --> 37:43.173
Let's go with that.

37:43.304 --> 37:44.871
Who taught you?

37:45.001 --> 37:46.525
My dad.

37:46.655 --> 37:48.831
He used to say

37:48.962 --> 37:50.442
if you want to learn
something new about yourself,

37:50.572 --> 37:52.444
put on waders.

37:52.574 --> 37:55.403
How often did
you, uh, guys go?

37:56.404 --> 37:58.537
Not often enough.

37:58.667 --> 38:00.365
We didn't talk much.

38:01.366 --> 38:03.846
But there was something
about fishing that river.

38:03.977 --> 38:05.457
Freed him.

38:05.587 --> 38:07.763
He'd open up.

38:08.764 --> 38:11.941
And I am thankful
for those days.

38:12.072 --> 38:13.769
I know what you mean.

38:13.900 --> 38:16.816
Before I went off
to boot camp,

38:16.946 --> 38:19.862
he took me fishing
for the weekend.

38:19.993 --> 38:21.908
We made a pact.

38:22.038 --> 38:24.476
Said we were gonna do that
every summer.

38:26.042 --> 38:28.218
But that was the last time.

38:28.349 --> 38:30.351
What stopped you?

38:31.396 --> 38:33.528
Excuses.

38:33.659 --> 38:36.270
[plane approaching]

38:44.322 --> 38:45.801
There's our ride.

38:52.547 --> 38:55.681
So, Parker gets the glory,
FBI gets the collar, and Gibbs

38:55.811 --> 38:58.205
gets arrested?VANCE:
Not exactly.

38:58.336 --> 39:00.947
Agent Parker let Gibbs go.

39:01.077 --> 39:03.297
Well, that's great. But why?

39:03.428 --> 39:05.865
Guess the FBI
finally came to their senses.

39:05.995 --> 39:09.303
No. Apparently, Parker
made a unilateral decision.

39:09.434 --> 39:10.913
How'd that go over
with his boss?

39:11.044 --> 39:13.046
Not well. His boss fired him.

39:13.176 --> 39:15.440
Whoa. Well, that's harsh.

39:15.570 --> 39:16.832
I mean,
I don't like the guy,

39:16.963 --> 39:19.226
but he didn't deserve
to lose his job.

39:19.357 --> 39:21.446
Parker ignored a direct order.

39:21.576 --> 39:23.839
Why would he do that?Well, because sometimes,

39:23.970 --> 39:26.364
there are more important things
than following orders.

39:27.930 --> 39:29.454
What about Gibbs?

39:29.584 --> 39:31.238
Since he has no warrant
for his arrest,

39:31.369 --> 39:32.326
can he come back to work?

39:32.457 --> 39:33.371
In theory.

39:33.501 --> 39:34.807
And in reality?

39:34.937 --> 39:36.330
That's not my decision.

39:36.461 --> 39:38.158
Uh, yes. Yes, it is.

39:38.288 --> 39:40.290
You suspended him.
Can't you talk to him?

39:40.421 --> 39:42.075
Can you convince him
to take his badge back?

39:42.205 --> 39:43.468
I already tried.

39:47.123 --> 39:49.256
He doesn't want it.

39:54.566 --> 39:56.045
I can take those for you.Thanks.

39:56.176 --> 39:57.438
You got it.

39:58.831 --> 40:01.355
Boss! You want me
to load your gear?

40:11.974 --> 40:13.759
Gibbs.

40:13.889 --> 40:15.413
You okay?

40:15.543 --> 40:17.589
Yeah. I've never been better.

40:17.719 --> 40:19.634
I know what you mean.

40:19.765 --> 40:22.550
This place is
pretty special.

40:22.681 --> 40:24.030
Can't wait to
come back one day.

40:24.160 --> 40:26.336
Well, I hope you do.

40:26.467 --> 40:29.209
Pilot's ready.
Just waiting on us.

40:32.517 --> 40:34.519
I'm not going back, Tim.

40:36.129 --> 40:37.609
To work?

40:37.739 --> 40:40.394
[chuckles]: Well, that, too.
I'm not going back home.

40:43.136 --> 40:45.007
You're staying here?

40:45.138 --> 40:46.748
For how long?

40:48.141 --> 40:49.969
Not sure.

40:50.926 --> 40:53.581
Boss, you realize we're
in the middle of nowhere, right?

40:53.712 --> 40:56.584
We're-we're 50 miles
from anyone or anything.

40:56.715 --> 40:58.934
Not a bad thing.

40:59.065 --> 41:01.546
Boss, this is crazy.
What are you thinking?

41:01.676 --> 41:04.984
I'm thinking I don't have
another boat left to build.

41:05.114 --> 41:06.725
Well, then,
we'll find you another hobby.

41:06.855 --> 41:08.466
I'm not looking for a hobby.

41:09.467 --> 41:11.294
What are you looking for?

41:11.425 --> 41:12.905
[chuckles]

41:13.035 --> 41:16.386
My gut's telling me
I'll know when I find it, Tim.

41:16.517 --> 41:18.911
And you think
you'll find it here?

41:19.041 --> 41:20.826
I don't know. I-I...

41:20.956 --> 41:23.655
Whatever I'm feeling,
this...

41:23.785 --> 41:26.005
this sense of peace,
I-I have not

41:26.135 --> 41:29.443
had this
since Shannon and Kelly died.

41:29.574 --> 41:33.012
And I'm not ready to let it go.

41:34.013 --> 41:35.754
So that's it?

41:36.711 --> 41:39.627
I could not have hoped

41:39.758 --> 41:41.934
for anyone better
to watch my back

41:42.064 --> 41:45.154
for the past 18 years
than you, Tim.

41:52.161 --> 41:53.511
I love you, man.

41:53.641 --> 41:54.686
[crying]:
I love you, too.

41:54.816 --> 41:56.383
[sniffles]

42:03.216 --> 42:05.871
Promise me you're gonna be okay.

42:06.872 --> 42:08.395
I already am.

42:11.616 --> 42:14.183
[chuckles]

42:16.534 --> 42:18.536
â™ª

42:31.592 --> 42:33.551
â™ª
