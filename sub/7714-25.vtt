00:12.101 --> 00:15.036
Please don't throw these out.

00:15.104 --> 00:16.671
See them all over the office.

00:16.739 --> 00:18.907
Toby has been leaving
radon kits everywhere,

00:18.975 --> 00:21.670
Like he owns the place.

00:21.738 --> 00:23.759
The first time I
threw mine away,

00:23.827 --> 00:25.698
I thought it was an ant trap.

00:25.766 --> 00:27.629
But I figured I'd
rather live with ants

00:27.697 --> 00:30.032
Than with his
creepy little disk.

00:30.100 --> 00:31.465
The second time...

00:31.531 --> 00:33.532
I thought it was one of those,

00:33.600 --> 00:35.965
You know, the things you
turn over, and it moos,

00:36.032 --> 00:37.433
Like a cow thing.

00:37.501 --> 00:40.673
But upon closer examination,

00:40.741 --> 00:43.212
It was another ant trap,
so I threw it away.

00:43.280 --> 00:45.887
And the third time...

00:45.955 --> 00:49.695
I did it out of spite.

00:49.763 --> 00:51.332
- Pfffttt!
- Come on, michael.

00:51.400 --> 00:52.536
You're interrupting.

00:52.604 --> 00:54.372
You're kidding me? God!

00:54.439 --> 00:55.873
You say radon is
silent but deadly,

00:55.941 --> 00:57.176
And then you expect me

00:57.244 --> 00:58.680
Not to make farting
noises with my mouth?

00:58.748 --> 01:00.416
What is this? - Please sit down.

01:00.484 --> 01:01.584
You know, we're not
gonna die of radon.

01:01.652 --> 01:03.153
We're gonna die of boredom.

01:03.221 --> 01:04.321
Yeah!

01:04.388 --> 01:05.357
Right?

01:05.425 --> 01:07.395
And if I had a gun
with two bullets

01:07.462 --> 01:10.066
And I was in a room with hitler,
bin laden, and toby,

01:10.134 --> 01:11.869
I would shoot toby twice.

01:11.936 --> 01:12.870
- No.
- No!

01:12.938 --> 01:14.540
- That's not...
- Okay.

01:14.608 --> 01:16.275
You were being really funny,
and then you went too far.

01:16.343 --> 01:18.244
I would kill bin
laden and then toby.

01:18.312 --> 01:19.781
- No, that's still...
- Mm-mm.

01:19.849 --> 01:21.852
Okay, geniuses,
how would you do it?

01:21.920 --> 01:23.221
Curve the bullet

01:23.289 --> 01:26.627
<i>Like in my favorite james mcavoy film,
wanted.</i>

01:26.694 --> 01:28.295
All that does is help
you shoot around things.

01:28.363 --> 01:30.431
Is there a curtain
rod in the room?

01:30.499 --> 01:32.769
- I don't know.
- How about make believe land

01:32.836 --> 01:34.437
Has anything you want?

01:34.504 --> 01:36.873
<i>Stanley, please.
This is serious!</i>

01:36.941 --> 01:38.341
Is this the thing where
they use an icicle

01:38.409 --> 01:39.709
So there's no evidence?

01:39.777 --> 01:41.212
Yes. We stab toby through
the heart with an icicle.

01:41.279 --> 01:43.347
Come on. The whole two bullet
thing is a red herring.

01:43.414 --> 01:44.515
Here's how you do it.

01:44.583 --> 01:46.384
You line them all up,
you take one bullet,

01:46.452 --> 01:49.354
Shoot them all through the
throat at the same time.

01:49.421 --> 01:50.921
Watch this.
Phyllis, you're hitler.

01:50.989 --> 01:52.857
Come up here. Toby, you're toby.

01:52.924 --> 01:54.558
Andy, you're bin laden. Line up.

01:54.626 --> 01:55.892
I don't wanna do this.
Throats together.

01:55.960 --> 01:57.394
toby, just do it!

01:57.462 --> 01:59.030
- Toby, come on.
- God!

01:59.098 --> 02:00.632
Ready? One bullet.

02:00.700 --> 02:02.702
And...Boom!

02:02.769 --> 02:03.870
Puuuhhh!

02:03.938 --> 02:05.573
Puuuhh!

02:05.641 --> 02:07.608
- Yeah, that works.
- That works.

02:07.676 --> 02:10.312
Good work.

02:13.350 --> 02:18.391
Sync by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

02:31.135 --> 02:33.169
What flavors did you get?

02:33.237 --> 02:34.671
It's so exciting, pam.

02:34.739 --> 02:36.639
The eagles are doing
a theme of ice creams

02:36.707 --> 02:37.907
In honor of turning 60.

02:37.975 --> 02:40.210
"despera-dough.
Witchy-womanilla."

02:40.278 --> 02:41.578
Why do they do this?

02:41.646 --> 02:43.213
Do you want me to go
back to the store?

02:43.281 --> 02:45.383
No, no, no, it's fine.
I was just commenting.

02:45.450 --> 02:47.685
We gotta get these out,
open 'em up.

02:47.753 --> 02:48.920
This is all for michael.

02:48.988 --> 02:50.421
Turns out his
girlfriend was married.

02:50.489 --> 02:52.557
Yeah. And when michael
gets a broken heart,

02:52.625 --> 02:54.059
This whole place
comes to a halt,

02:54.127 --> 02:56.495
So we're just trying to
get out in front of this.

02:56.563 --> 02:57.663
After his last breakup,

02:57.731 --> 02:59.699
He ate 40,000 calories
in three hours.

02:59.767 --> 03:02.035
Right, pam?
That's what pam told me.

03:02.103 --> 03:04.505
Yeah. Or no--well--

03:04.572 --> 03:06.006
I don't know. I'm sorry.

03:06.074 --> 03:07.742
I was up all night with cece,

03:07.809 --> 03:09.744
Otherwise I'd be running this.

03:09.811 --> 03:11.278
That's okay.

03:11.346 --> 03:14.481
You probably shouldn't keep
a baby up that late, though.

03:14.549 --> 03:16.050
<i>We have mr. Bean playing in
the conference room</i>

03:16.117 --> 03:17.684
<i>And the pink panther movie
in his office</i>

03:17.752 --> 03:19.186
With half-hour shifts
to watch with him.

03:19.254 --> 03:21.121
And we need bodies in
both these rooms, people,

03:21.189 --> 03:22.123
So please sign up.

03:22.190 --> 03:23.358
- He's coming.
- Oh. Okay.

03:23.425 --> 03:25.427
Everyone, remember,
when he gets like this,

03:25.494 --> 03:27.362
He will wallow if you empathize.

03:27.430 --> 03:28.764
Keep conversations light

03:28.832 --> 03:30.933
And if you get stuck and
you don't know what to do,

03:31.001 --> 03:32.501
Make a random sound
effect, okay?

03:32.569 --> 03:33.703
Farting noise, whatever.

03:33.771 --> 03:34.771
Okay.

03:34.839 --> 03:35.905
- Hey, everyone.
- No, toby!

03:35.973 --> 03:37.440
- No! Out!
- Get out right now!

03:37.508 --> 03:38.909
- Leave now.
- Leave. Get outta here.

03:38.977 --> 03:40.578
- Please!
- Right now.

03:40.645 --> 03:42.613
Oh, and if he makes a joke,

03:42.681 --> 03:44.048
Just laugh it up,
no matter what.

03:44.116 --> 03:45.516
Okay?

03:47.987 --> 03:49.253
Morning, everyone.

03:49.321 --> 03:50.955
Hey!

03:51.023 --> 03:52.056
- Hey!
- Hey.

03:52.124 --> 03:54.158
Hello. - Michael.

03:54.226 --> 03:55.727
Nice tie or something.

03:55.794 --> 03:58.262
Oh, thank you.
It's reversible, I think.

03:59.798 --> 04:01.132
- That's hilarious.
- That's awesome.

04:01.199 --> 04:02.566
You want some ice cream?

04:02.634 --> 04:04.135
Oh--oh, wow!

04:04.203 --> 04:06.003
Are those eagles' flavors?

04:06.071 --> 04:08.573
Cake it to the limit.
That's my favorite.

04:08.640 --> 04:09.774
I love that.

04:09.841 --> 04:12.176
Too much for me
to have by myself.

04:12.244 --> 04:14.078
Anybody wanna share?

04:14.146 --> 04:15.813
Boi-oi-oi-oing!

04:15.881 --> 04:18.916
Okay. Well...That's random.

04:18.983 --> 04:22.454
I will dig into those later.

04:22.521 --> 04:23.989
I don't follow this exactly.

04:24.056 --> 04:26.291
Uh, "the descendants of any
replicants from this union

04:26.359 --> 04:27.359
Shall have"--

04:27.427 --> 04:29.328
Joint custody.

04:29.396 --> 04:31.832
Are we talking about
your grandchildren?

04:31.899 --> 04:33.033
- No.
- No.

04:33.101 --> 04:34.435
Rather than spend
all day in court,

04:34.502 --> 04:36.403
We've decided to
settle our dispute

04:36.471 --> 04:37.605
Using a mediator.

04:37.673 --> 04:38.806
It was an option spelled out

04:38.874 --> 04:40.808
In our child-rearing
contract and...

04:40.876 --> 04:42.910
- Alleged contract.
- Alleged?

04:42.978 --> 04:45.379
I'm going to own your farm
by the time this is over.

04:45.447 --> 04:47.048
Pff. Yeah, just try.

04:47.115 --> 04:49.683
I will do legal jujitsu on you.

04:49.751 --> 04:51.085
- Oh, yeah--
- gaah!

04:51.152 --> 04:52.986
See? Don't even need
to make contact.

04:53.054 --> 04:55.422
The law will do it.

04:55.490 --> 04:57.590
So much of this is just
impossible to verify.

04:57.658 --> 05:01.060
Item five, point "b"-- uh,
the beet juice cleanse.

05:01.128 --> 05:02.562
I'm doing it. You know I am.

05:02.630 --> 05:04.263
It's disgusting!
How do we know this?

05:04.331 --> 05:06.265
I'd like to see a stool sample.

05:06.332 --> 05:08.100
Dwight, look at my teeth.

05:08.168 --> 05:09.767
Eh.

05:09.835 --> 05:11.569
No secret crying.

05:11.637 --> 05:14.505
Hasn't even opened the
tissue box in there.

05:14.573 --> 05:16.373
Could he still be seeing her?

05:16.441 --> 05:17.874
I don't think he'd do that.

05:17.942 --> 05:19.409
So we're gonna say the
most likely scenario

05:19.477 --> 05:21.744
Is that michael
matured overnight?

05:21.812 --> 05:24.113
<i>Well, it happened to tom
hanks in big.</i>

05:24.181 --> 05:28.318
<i>Exactly. It happened in big.</i>

05:28.385 --> 05:30.286
No, I gotta go. Text me later.

05:30.354 --> 05:32.054
I'm really too tired to do this.

05:32.122 --> 05:33.722
- Me too!
- Then let's just not do this!

05:33.790 --> 05:36.825
Do you have any idea
the risks involved?

05:36.893 --> 05:38.494
- Hey, michael.
- Hey.

05:38.562 --> 05:40.029
We were wondering if
you'd like to have

05:40.096 --> 05:41.897
Dinner with us
tonight in our home

05:41.965 --> 05:43.232
And play with our baby.

05:43.299 --> 05:45.333
We could order in from hooters.

05:45.401 --> 05:46.769
Oh, hooters to go. Nice.

05:46.836 --> 05:48.638
<i>We can watch a movie.
And play rock band.</i>

05:48.705 --> 05:50.840
<i>- Billy joel rock band.
- That...Exists?</i>

05:50.908 --> 05:52.108
Yes.

05:52.176 --> 05:54.244
Okay, well, I'll have
to take a rain check,

05:54.311 --> 05:56.413
But thanks for the offer.

05:56.480 --> 05:58.814
Michael scott,
are you still seeing donna?

06:00.183 --> 06:02.651
Okay, pam...

06:02.719 --> 06:05.087
She's not invisible,
so stop asking silly questions.

06:05.155 --> 06:06.589
Oh, michael.

06:06.657 --> 06:08.491
Since when is this an office

06:08.558 --> 06:10.959
Where we delve into each
other's personal lives?

06:11.027 --> 06:13.862
I like donna.

06:13.929 --> 06:16.397
Is it wrong to keep seeing her?

06:16.465 --> 06:17.865
Depends on who you ask.

06:17.933 --> 06:20.602
I mean, if you ask
her husband...

06:20.670 --> 06:23.972
Or you took a random poll,
yeah, it's wrong.

06:24.040 --> 06:25.607
That is something
I would never do.

06:25.675 --> 06:26.675
Well, I think we all know

06:26.743 --> 06:28.010
What you're capable of,
meredith.

06:28.077 --> 06:29.812
Hey, I have never cheated on,
been cheated on,

06:29.880 --> 06:31.447
Or been used to cheat with.

06:31.515 --> 06:34.116
I ask...Everyone in the room,

06:34.184 --> 06:38.355
"are you in a relationship?"

06:38.422 --> 06:39.622
People, this is scranton,

06:39.690 --> 06:41.023
And many people
consider that to be

06:41.091 --> 06:43.126
The paris of northeastern
pennsylvania.

06:43.193 --> 06:44.460
And in paris,

06:44.528 --> 06:46.329
It is rude for a woman to
have less than four lovers.

06:46.397 --> 06:47.330
Uhh! Ryan, I do not want you

06:47.398 --> 06:48.331
Hanging out with
michael anymore.

06:48.398 --> 06:49.765
Okay.

06:49.833 --> 06:52.534
Okay, I will have you know
that I asked donna about this,

06:52.602 --> 06:53.835
And she is fine with it,

06:53.903 --> 06:55.770
And just to be sure,
I asked her again afterward.

06:55.838 --> 06:57.772
Same answer. - How
does he feel about it?

06:57.840 --> 06:59.574
He is never gonna find out.

06:59.642 --> 07:01.543
He is a high school
baseball coach.

07:01.610 --> 07:05.213
He wakes up early.
He goes to bed early.

07:05.281 --> 07:07.649
Look at how long it took
for him to find out.

07:07.717 --> 07:09.952
It was right under his nose.
I had to tell him!

07:10.019 --> 07:11.654
Now you're just being hurtful.

07:11.721 --> 07:13.956
I'm sorry, it-- why is it okay

07:14.024 --> 07:16.292
For stanley to cheat
or for phyllis to cheat

07:16.360 --> 07:18.728
- Hey--
- on...Her diet?

07:18.796 --> 07:21.464
He's a sports guy. He's scummy.

07:21.531 --> 07:23.932
Dogfighting, drugs. They spit.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.100
Did donna tell you that?

07:25.168 --> 07:27.802
<i>Real sports with bryant gumbel.</i>

07:27.870 --> 07:29.237
So you're just making
a giant assumption.

07:29.305 --> 07:30.905
You don't even know the guy.
You know what?

07:30.973 --> 07:34.375
You know what? I am declaring
a moment of silence right now.

07:34.442 --> 07:37.244
Ten minutes of silence
honoring michael jackson.

07:37.312 --> 07:41.514
Just sit there and think
about michael jackson.

07:41.582 --> 07:43.250
My name is andy bernard,
and I'm a cuckold.

07:43.317 --> 07:45.485
For those of you unfamiliar
with william shakespeare,

07:45.553 --> 07:48.255
A cuckold is a man whose
woman is cheating on him.

07:48.323 --> 07:50.991
I've lived the part.

07:51.059 --> 07:53.828
And let me tell you,
I would so much rather...

07:53.896 --> 07:57.031
Play the part on stage.

07:57.099 --> 07:59.867
So...Here's the thing
about infidelity.

07:59.935 --> 08:01.602
Mm, no, no.

08:01.670 --> 08:02.937
When are you people
going to stop casting

08:03.005 --> 08:04.205
The first stone?

08:04.272 --> 08:05.573
I am not in the wrong here.

08:05.640 --> 08:07.041
I am the good guy.

08:07.108 --> 08:08.943
How does that work?

08:09.010 --> 08:12.847
Do you think this husband
is a super sweet nice guy?

08:12.914 --> 08:15.283
Do you think he's an angel?
I don't think so.

08:15.350 --> 08:16.784
Why is his wife going off

08:16.852 --> 08:20.120
And having a little
something-something with me?

08:20.188 --> 08:24.024
There has to be a
problem with him.

08:24.092 --> 08:25.192
In any cheating movie,

08:25.260 --> 08:27.794
The person getting
cheated on is the hero.

08:27.861 --> 08:30.463
You're ali larter. I'm beyonce.

08:30.530 --> 08:31.797
I am beyonce always.

08:31.864 --> 08:34.099
- Not this time.
- Yes, I am.

08:34.166 --> 08:36.067
This guy's a high school
baseball coach, right?

08:36.134 --> 08:37.400
Let's go check him out,

08:37.469 --> 08:38.535
See what a horrible
person he is.

08:38.604 --> 08:40.304
- I would love that.
- Yeah.

08:40.371 --> 08:41.772
Those teams have games
and practices every day.

08:41.840 --> 08:44.241
Let's go check it out.
I have work to do.

08:44.309 --> 08:47.111
Oh, really? I thought
you were the boss.

08:47.178 --> 08:49.413
Let's go.

08:49.481 --> 08:51.315
I can't wait to see this jerk

08:51.382 --> 08:52.817
Who is making me
cheat on his wife.

08:52.884 --> 08:54.118
Should punch him in the nose

08:54.186 --> 08:56.720
For what he's
making me do to her.

09:01.043 --> 09:02.676
<i>* bum bum bum bum *</i>

09:02.744 --> 09:04.145
* bum bum bum bum *

09:04.212 --> 09:05.579
* bum bum bum bum * - all right,
andy, please.

09:05.647 --> 09:07.314
- Baseball!
- Shh!

09:07.382 --> 09:11.451
Try not to draw attention,
please.

09:11.518 --> 09:12.618
That's him. That's him.

09:12.686 --> 09:15.287
- Where?
- Right there. The coach!

09:15.355 --> 09:16.989
Stage right or stage left?

09:17.056 --> 09:18.423
<i>I played batboy in
damn yankees!</i>

09:18.490 --> 09:19.924
Right there. Look, look.

09:19.992 --> 09:21.926
Follow my finger. Okay? See?

09:21.994 --> 09:23.594
The grownup by the base?

09:23.662 --> 09:25.796
and now, coaching third base

09:25.864 --> 09:28.099
With two arms, two legs,
and no heart.

09:28.167 --> 09:29.968
Capable of feeling pain.
All right.

09:30.036 --> 09:31.536
Can you just--

09:31.604 --> 09:33.538
Can you just act normal
for a second, please?

09:33.606 --> 09:36.675
Whatever.
I'm the one blending in.

09:45.286 --> 09:46.286
Guys?

09:46.353 --> 09:47.754
- Pam.
- Mm. Hey.

09:47.822 --> 09:49.222
Oh, hi, gabe.

09:49.290 --> 09:51.557
Can you two please
join me in my office?

09:51.625 --> 09:53.727
Now.

09:57.598 --> 09:59.166
You were supposed
to be the lookout.

09:59.233 --> 10:00.567
Yeah. Well,
it's really warm in here.

10:00.635 --> 10:02.469
It's like a sleeping bag.

10:02.537 --> 10:04.071
I don't wanna be the heavy here,

10:04.139 --> 10:07.174
But honestly, guys,
this makes us all look bad.

10:07.242 --> 10:09.076
- Sorry about that.
- So embarrassing.

10:09.143 --> 10:11.378
Good. Okay.

10:11.446 --> 10:13.580
End of the dressing down.

10:13.648 --> 10:15.481
I just hate that part
of the job, you know,

10:15.549 --> 10:17.683
The power dynamics.

10:17.751 --> 10:19.152
Well, you were
surprisingly restrained.

10:19.219 --> 10:21.020
We will be well-rested tomorrow.

10:21.088 --> 10:22.355
Okay. That's great, actually,

10:22.422 --> 10:24.023
Because I wanted to talk to
you about something else.

10:24.091 --> 10:25.725
Excellent. Go for it.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.726
I'm sure you got my email
about the printer fires.

10:27.794 --> 10:29.795
The one with the
branching decision tree?

10:29.863 --> 10:31.230
I actually designed that chart.

10:31.298 --> 10:33.099
Kinda hoping it catches on.

10:33.167 --> 10:34.834
Anyway, the question is,

10:34.902 --> 10:36.269
What is the best way

10:36.337 --> 10:39.540
To disseminate important
information in an efficient way?

10:39.608 --> 10:43.244
Right? So, uh, let's, uh...

10:43.312 --> 10:44.578
Finally there's a provision here

10:44.646 --> 10:46.914
In the occurrence that the
child is born an old man,

10:46.982 --> 10:48.283
A la benjamin button.

10:48.350 --> 10:49.984
- Same page.
- Same page. Go to the next one.

10:50.052 --> 10:51.419
Just keep moving.

10:51.487 --> 10:53.020
Despite the provision covering

10:53.088 --> 10:54.722
Whether this is all
part of the matrix--

10:54.790 --> 10:56.224
Which we can't know.

10:56.291 --> 10:58.692
- This is essentially...
- Unless we're unplugged.

10:58.760 --> 11:01.929
Equivalent to a donor
or surrogate contractor.

11:01.997 --> 11:03.397
And wake up in the future.

11:03.465 --> 11:05.766
Which is actually pretty common.

11:05.834 --> 11:10.071
So I have to tell you that
this is a solid contract.

11:10.138 --> 11:11.172
What?

11:11.240 --> 11:12.573
Look, I can't enforce

11:12.641 --> 11:14.575
That anybody have a
child with anyone else.

11:14.643 --> 11:16.577
- What?
- So essentially,

11:16.645 --> 11:18.446
This comes down to damages.

11:18.514 --> 11:22.417
Now, there is some precedence
for the range of $30,000.

11:22.485 --> 11:23.618
What?

11:23.686 --> 11:25.854
I don't have $30,
000 lying around.

11:25.921 --> 11:27.689
I have it buried very deeply,

11:27.757 --> 11:31.559
And I don't want to dig past
a certain someone to get it.

11:31.627 --> 11:34.262
Chase dixon is up.
Could be a big play.

11:34.330 --> 11:35.330
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

11:35.397 --> 11:36.831
I know it's like cricket.

11:36.899 --> 11:38.098
- You don't. No, no.
- And it's--there's--

11:38.166 --> 11:40.267
Well, home plate
is like a wicket.

11:40.335 --> 11:42.436
- You don't know. You don't-
- you don't know anything.

11:42.503 --> 11:43.970
Look at him.
Look at him over there.

11:44.038 --> 11:47.874
High-fiving?
He didn't even do anything.

11:47.941 --> 11:50.910
Kid did all the work.
I bet he does that at home.

11:50.978 --> 11:54.314
I bet it's like, "hey, donna,
why don't you wash the dishes?

11:54.382 --> 11:55.782
"high-five, donna.

11:55.850 --> 11:57.417
"hey, why don't you
bring me my slippers?

11:57.485 --> 11:59.786
High-five. I'm taking
all the credit."

11:59.854 --> 12:01.488
Seems pretty well
liked by the team.

12:01.555 --> 12:05.125
Okay, well, that's because
he's paying their salary.

12:05.193 --> 12:08.429
You do know that
high school coaches

12:08.497 --> 12:10.131
Don't pay their players.
I know, I know, I know.

12:10.199 --> 12:12.500
It--I'm--it-
that was a euphemism.

12:12.568 --> 12:14.736
$30,000? There's
gotta be another way.

12:14.804 --> 12:18.072
He has a 60-acre beet farm
that is worth a small fortune.

12:18.140 --> 12:19.641
Look, I will not pay.

12:19.708 --> 12:23.511
Well, I have an alternative.

12:23.578 --> 12:24.845
"intercourse to completion.

12:24.913 --> 12:27.148
Five individual times
rendered at my discretion"?

12:27.215 --> 12:28.749
Look, I don't think
that's actually legal.

12:28.817 --> 12:31.919
Agreed.

12:31.987 --> 12:33.687
Five times for $30,000?

12:33.755 --> 12:37.858
Not a bad stud fee.
Better than most horses.

12:37.926 --> 12:39.793
But not in your bed. It's lumpy.

12:39.861 --> 12:41.695
Those lumps are cats,
and those cats have names,

12:41.763 --> 12:44.664
And those names are ember,
milky way, diane, and lumpy.

12:44.732 --> 12:46.700
Fine. Five times.

12:46.768 --> 12:48.369
Look, I can't legally
watch this unfold.

12:48.436 --> 12:51.005
It's coming a little dangerously
close to prostitution.

12:51.072 --> 12:53.007
- I want eye contact.
- No.

12:53.074 --> 12:54.174
- Yes.
- Do you understand

12:54.242 --> 12:55.309
How rare that is in nature?

12:55.377 --> 12:58.379
I'm not some farm animal.

13:00.682 --> 13:03.151
Great game, coach.
Shh! Okay, all right.

13:03.218 --> 13:04.152
Don't--don't--

13:04.219 --> 13:05.386
You guys are awesome!

13:05.454 --> 13:07.822
Best game I've ever
seen in my life.

13:07.890 --> 13:09.958
Yeah, right. You must be
rootin' for the other guys.

13:10.025 --> 13:11.726
Ha. The other guys can go die.

13:11.794 --> 13:13.061
- okay.
- Baseball!

13:13.128 --> 13:15.496
Go talk to him. - No.
God. You go talk to him.

13:15.564 --> 13:17.732
- Let's go.
- Shane.

13:17.800 --> 13:19.968
Great game, man.

13:20.035 --> 13:21.235
Do I know you?

13:21.303 --> 13:24.505
No. Uh, just big fans.
Both of us.

13:24.573 --> 13:26.507
Are somebody's...Parents?

13:26.575 --> 13:28.475
Oh, are you guys...

13:28.543 --> 13:30.077
Kenny's dads?

13:30.145 --> 13:31.512
Ha. No. No.

13:31.580 --> 13:34.182
But we're gay for baseball.

13:34.249 --> 13:35.716
- Okay.
- But I have a wife, actually,

13:35.784 --> 13:37.585
Who I really love a lot. - Okay.

13:37.653 --> 13:38.753
Yeah.

13:38.821 --> 13:40.788
I am so into the
institution of marriage.

13:40.856 --> 13:42.156
Whoa!

13:42.224 --> 13:43.925
I mean, isn't marriage
the best, you know?

13:43.992 --> 13:46.060
Two good people
finding each other,

13:46.128 --> 13:49.730
Getting all committed
to each other.

13:49.798 --> 13:51.598
So you love baseball.
What else do you love?

13:51.666 --> 13:53.233
Let's round you out as a person.

13:53.300 --> 13:54.767
Hey, I'm really sorry,
I'm just trying to...

13:54.835 --> 13:56.202
Focus here on the game.

13:56.270 --> 13:57.603
I get it, man. I love it.

13:57.671 --> 13:59.072
That's what makes
you a good coach.

13:59.139 --> 14:01.273
You know, but as a fan,
it just helps me

14:01.341 --> 14:05.377
Enjoy the game better if I
know the coach loves his wife.

14:05.444 --> 14:08.046
Of course. Okay? I gotta...
Get back to this.

14:08.114 --> 14:09.348
- Of course.
- All right.

14:09.416 --> 14:11.516
But real quick, I want
you to meet my associate.

14:11.584 --> 14:12.685
Sheldon! - No, no, no.

14:12.752 --> 14:14.020
- Come on, get over here.
- I'm good.

14:14.087 --> 14:15.521
Oh, my god. - Get over here.

14:15.589 --> 14:17.790
Sheldon, say hi
to the nice coach.

14:17.858 --> 14:19.258
Sorry. I got some
stomach cramps.

14:19.326 --> 14:21.193
It's all right, all right,
just keep it going!

14:21.261 --> 14:22.795
Well, that was not at
all what I expected.

14:22.863 --> 14:24.731
Hoo hoo!

14:24.798 --> 14:26.866
Whoo. My heart's still racing.

14:26.934 --> 14:30.403
I just looked a man in the
eyes and I shook his hand.

14:30.470 --> 14:32.738
All the time I was thinking,
"I'm sleeping with your wife."

14:32.806 --> 14:36.508
And you know who does that?
James freakin' bond.

14:37.849 --> 14:39.750
Okay, orange slices.

14:39.818 --> 14:41.318
There ya go. - Thanks, michael.

14:41.386 --> 14:43.787
Don't thank me.
Thank dylan's mom.

14:43.855 --> 14:45.122
Here you go! Oh!

14:45.190 --> 14:46.757
Ooh hoo hoo hoo hoo!

14:46.825 --> 14:48.426
Why would you throw
something wet at me?

14:48.494 --> 14:50.462
You love it. There ya go.

14:50.530 --> 14:52.197
Now, were those for the team?

14:52.264 --> 14:55.166
Uh, no, they didn't say team.
They just said coal hawks.

14:55.234 --> 14:56.201
- Ah.
- I don't think those

14:56.268 --> 14:57.402
Were yours to take.

14:57.470 --> 14:59.037
Well, then it wouldn't
be the first time

14:59.105 --> 15:00.872
I stole something
away from coach shane.

15:00.940 --> 15:02.674
I just wanna go on
record as saying

15:02.742 --> 15:04.509
That I do not
condone this affair,

15:04.577 --> 15:05.978
And I even went so far

15:06.045 --> 15:08.913
As to force michael to confront
the victim of his behavior.

15:08.981 --> 15:11.382
- Did you talk to him?
- I did.

15:11.450 --> 15:12.550
You talked to the man

15:12.618 --> 15:14.586
Whose wife you're
having an affair with.

15:14.653 --> 15:16.922
- Wow. That is crazy.
- Was there a fistfight?

15:16.989 --> 15:19.524
No. We just talked.
He's very nice.

15:19.592 --> 15:21.059
And it didn't change your mind.

15:21.126 --> 15:23.094
- It did not.
- Michael, that's awful.

15:23.162 --> 15:24.562
- Isn't it?
- Yes.

15:24.630 --> 15:26.364
- I'm awful, aren't I?
- Yeah.

15:26.431 --> 15:27.598
That's pretty bad.
I'm an awful guy! Ooh!

15:27.666 --> 15:29.467
How can you live with yourself?

15:29.534 --> 15:31.402
I am what I am, oscar.

15:31.470 --> 15:33.404
And I want what I want.

15:33.472 --> 15:35.807
And right now,
I want a piece of cake.

15:35.875 --> 15:37.275
From now on, when I'm hungry,

15:37.343 --> 15:39.478
I am going to eat
whatever I am hungry for.

15:39.546 --> 15:42.481
That is a dangerous game,
friendo.

15:42.549 --> 15:43.949
Well, because I thought
that it was a book

15:44.017 --> 15:45.584
About anthropology the store.

15:45.652 --> 15:47.553
I don't know why you were in
that part of the bookstore.

15:47.620 --> 15:49.254
'cause it's next to the
baby section, okay?

15:49.322 --> 15:50.522
All right,
that makes more sense.

15:50.589 --> 15:51.823
You should have said
that at the beginning

15:51.891 --> 15:53.391
When you said, " I read a
book about anthropology."

15:53.459 --> 15:55.126
I don't really know why you're
screaming at me right now.

15:55.194 --> 15:56.727
- I'm not scream-
- I'm not screaming.

15:56.795 --> 15:58.829
That's meredith's cake.
It's her birthday.

15:58.897 --> 16:00.297
I don't care.

16:00.364 --> 16:04.067
I have an appetite for life!

16:04.134 --> 16:05.935
Mmm.

16:06.003 --> 16:07.437
Mmm! Oh, god.

16:07.504 --> 16:09.172
That's lemon.

16:09.240 --> 16:11.908
Good for you, man.

16:11.976 --> 16:14.745
Good for you.

16:17.215 --> 16:20.518
He takes what he wants.

16:22.021 --> 16:23.421
You know what?

16:23.489 --> 16:26.024
I think you're attractive,
and I wanna sleep with you.

16:26.092 --> 16:27.493
What about kelly?

16:27.560 --> 16:29.194
You read my mind.

16:29.262 --> 16:30.862
is this a joke?

16:30.930 --> 16:34.066
Yep.

16:35.401 --> 16:36.701
It's hard to live that way, man.

16:36.769 --> 16:39.004
You gotta really not care
what people think about you.

16:39.071 --> 16:40.739
I-I don't know how
you do it, michael,

16:40.807 --> 16:43.908
I-I-I can't be that cold.

16:43.976 --> 16:46.111
You'll learn, baby.
You'll learn.

16:52.551 --> 16:55.820
I am an honorable man,
and I will honor the contract.

16:55.888 --> 16:58.157
But I don't have to
give her the good stuff.

16:58.224 --> 16:59.658
Schrute sperm are strong,

16:59.726 --> 17:01.494
But they're no match for
a grown schrute man.

17:02.963 --> 17:04.997
let's see what she gets.

17:05.065 --> 17:07.467
aah!

17:10.237 --> 17:12.238
Uh, boss, we're out of paper.

17:12.305 --> 17:14.106
- Yeah, I noticed that.
- Are you gonna add any more?

17:14.173 --> 17:15.740
Nope.

17:15.808 --> 17:18.108
He don't give an
"f" about nothin'!

17:18.176 --> 17:21.078
I have got big balls.

17:21.146 --> 17:23.347
I don't think I'm gonna make it.

17:23.415 --> 17:25.515
what about an energy
drink or something?

17:25.582 --> 17:26.781
It gets in the breast milk.

17:26.849 --> 17:29.117
If I drink it, cece
drinks it six hours later.

17:29.185 --> 17:30.419
Well, it doesn't mean
I can't drink it.

17:30.486 --> 17:31.720
Well, it does and it doesn't.

17:31.788 --> 17:33.688
Probably shouldn't
tell you this,

17:33.756 --> 17:36.525
But a lotta guys
in the warehouse

17:36.593 --> 17:40.029
Work multiple jobs,
so... We have a place.

17:40.097 --> 17:42.765
- A place?
- A restful location.

17:42.833 --> 17:45.401
Talk to glen. He'll
take you up in the lift.

17:45.469 --> 17:47.804
You sleep in the warehouse?

17:47.871 --> 17:50.940
Lightbulb's burnt out,
so it's dark.

17:51.007 --> 17:53.042
And the heat from
the backup generator

17:53.109 --> 17:54.910
Keeps it nice and warm.

17:54.978 --> 17:56.078
Sometimes I think about it

17:56.146 --> 17:58.080
When I'm trying to
fall asleep at home.

17:58.148 --> 18:00.249
But as far as the rest
of the office goes,

18:00.317 --> 18:02.718
It doesn't exist, okay?

18:02.786 --> 18:04.153
- Okay.
- Pam.

18:04.221 --> 18:06.055
Okay.

18:06.123 --> 18:08.724
- For your signature.
- Okay.

18:15.099 --> 18:17.434
Phyllis.

18:17.501 --> 18:20.837
Okay. Look at me.

18:20.905 --> 18:23.039
Phyllis, look at--

18:23.107 --> 18:25.675
Okay, that's...

18:25.743 --> 18:27.010
All right, all right.

18:27.077 --> 18:29.712
You know what? I'm sick of this.

18:29.780 --> 18:32.515
I'm sick of the little
disapproving head shakes.

18:32.583 --> 18:35.250
If you think that's going
to have any effect on me,

18:35.318 --> 18:36.485
It will not.

18:36.553 --> 18:38.020
I am going to leave right now

18:38.088 --> 18:40.622
And go to a motel to meet donna.

18:40.690 --> 18:42.291
Why not your condo?

18:42.358 --> 18:46.060
Because a motel is
dirty and it is sexy.

18:46.128 --> 18:49.030
Like me. And like donna.

18:49.098 --> 18:51.032
And frankly,
the stuff that we're into

18:51.100 --> 18:52.433
Isn't very condo-appropriate.

18:52.501 --> 18:54.436
Oh, michael, will you drop it?

18:54.503 --> 18:55.804
Everybody's spoken their mind,

18:55.871 --> 18:57.138
And no one's
changing their mind.

18:57.206 --> 18:59.374
Okay, morgan
freeman-narrating-everything.

18:59.442 --> 19:00.909
Do you want someone to stop you?

19:00.977 --> 19:05.681
'cause no one's going to.
Nobody better try to stop me.

19:05.748 --> 19:07.450
Good.

19:07.517 --> 19:10.152
I could have stopped him.

19:16.758 --> 19:18.525
- Are you warmed up?
- No.

19:18.592 --> 19:22.128
God, angela, why is that
always my responsibility?

19:23.264 --> 19:24.364
What did you do to yourself?

19:24.432 --> 19:26.299
Never mind. Just never mind.

19:26.367 --> 19:28.601
- Well, it better work.
- Oh, it'll work.

19:28.669 --> 19:31.037
Mm. Stop kissing me.

19:31.105 --> 19:33.006
It's not in the contract.

20:10.943 --> 20:13.678
How do I feel about
breaking up with donna?

20:13.746 --> 20:17.349
Good. Moral. I feel proud.

20:17.417 --> 20:19.852
like a grownup.

20:19.919 --> 20:24.190
That was not easy because
I really liked her a lot.

20:24.257 --> 20:26.024
And I'm a little bit
emotional right now

20:26.092 --> 20:29.361
Because I know that I absolutely

20:29.429 --> 20:30.762
Made the right decision.

20:30.830 --> 20:35.233
At the end of the day,
we have to do what's right.

20:35.301 --> 20:37.669
And it was either
living with myself

20:37.736 --> 20:41.171
Or...Being happy.

20:43.074 --> 20:45.842
And I picked...

20:45.910 --> 20:48.711
The...

20:48.779 --> 20:51.714
Former.

20:53.574 --> 20:55.809
- Michael scott?
- Yes?

20:55.876 --> 20:57.944
Do you wanna make a
comment on the rumors?

20:58.011 --> 20:59.912
um...

20:59.980 --> 21:00.679
I have done some
very bad things,

21:24.680 --> 21:28.680
