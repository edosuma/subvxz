00:08.125 --> 00:10.208
Say, Mick, I'm in a real pickle.

00:10.208 --> 00:12.041
My grandma's in town, and well,

00:12.041 --> 00:14.875
my place just ain't fit
for her to stay at.

00:14.875 --> 00:16.125
Would it be all right

00:16.125 --> 00:18.125
if she stayed at your place tonight?

00:18.375 --> 00:21.166
Gee, goofy, uh...
Aw, heck. Why not?

00:21.166 --> 00:22.417
You're a lifesaver, Mick!

00:22.417 --> 00:23.917
I'll go and get her.

00:26.542 --> 00:28.291
Why, hello. I...
What's to eat?

00:29.583 --> 00:31.458
How about some lovely tea and biscuits?

00:31.458 --> 00:35.083
Biscuits? I'm fixing
to fix myself...

00:38.583 --> 00:42.375
A sandwich!

00:46.000 --> 00:47.709
Pardon grandma.

00:48.625 --> 00:51.166
...350,000 tons of...

00:51.458 --> 00:55.166
Barbara, how was I supposed
to know it was a gorilla?

00:58.041 --> 01:00.333
Ah, here we go.
Not so fast, Sonny!

01:03.041 --> 01:04.083
Whoo! Yeah!

01:11.291 --> 01:13.250
And here's the room
where you'll be staying.

01:13.250 --> 01:14.917
I hope you like it.

01:19.667 --> 01:23.291
I think this room's
a little more my style.

01:30.917 --> 01:33.709
Breakfast is being
served in the mess hall!

01:36.125 --> 01:39.500
All right, look. You can eat all
my food, smash up my walls,

01:39.500 --> 01:40.792
but I draw the line...

01:40.792 --> 01:42.625
I hope you like hot cakes.

01:42.625 --> 01:47.667
I always think they taste a little
better when they're heart shaped.

01:47.667 --> 01:49.000
For me?

01:50.542 --> 01:53.125
Here comes grandma. Here
comes grandma. Here comes...

01:53.125 --> 01:54.125
Whoa!

01:59.208 --> 02:02.834
Well, they don't call it
"break-fast" for nothin'.

02:04.208 --> 02:05.667
Hello, goofy?

02:05.667 --> 02:06.875
Hello, goofy?

02:06.875 --> 02:09.166
I'm sorry, but your
grandma has got to go.

02:09.166 --> 02:11.041
<i>Aw, please, Mick.
Just one more night.</i>

02:11.041 --> 02:12.917
Absolutely not...
<i>Aw, thanks, Mick.</i>

02:12.917 --> 02:14.333
I knew you'd understand.

02:14.333 --> 02:16.834
You're the best friend a
guy could ever have. In fact...

02:16.834 --> 02:18.041
Goofy?

02:18.041 --> 02:20.458
I'll talk to you later,
Mick. I gotta go.

02:21.959 --> 02:23.375
All right, goofy.
What's going on?

02:23.375 --> 02:25.709
Goofy? Why, there's
nobody here but...

02:25.709 --> 02:28.208
Ah! Young man!
What's gotten into you?

02:28.208 --> 02:30.583
Oh, just stop it, goofy!
I know it's you!

02:30.583 --> 02:32.375
I know it's you!
I know it's...

02:33.542 --> 02:34.959
You.

02:34.959 --> 02:36.709
Heya, Mick.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.375
What did I do?
What did I do?

02:39.375 --> 02:41.500
What did I do?

02:41.959 --> 02:45.125
Oh, all right, Mick.
You were right.

02:45.125 --> 02:46.542
But then... who...

02:52.875 --> 02:54.083
Why, goofy?

02:54.083 --> 02:57.125
Mickey, I... I couldn't stay in my house.

02:57.125 --> 02:59.125
Not one more night!

02:59.125 --> 03:00.375
Why not?

03:00.375 --> 03:03.000
Because there was a spider.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.083
A spider?
In your house?

03:07.000 --> 03:09.208
Ugh. All right,
goofy, let's go.

03:09.208 --> 03:10.417
What? Go where?

03:10.417 --> 03:12.208
To go take care of the spider.

03:14.041 --> 03:15.041
Careful, Mick.

03:16.166 --> 03:17.709
Don't look him directly in the mandibles.

03:17.709 --> 03:20.000
Aw, goofy.
It's just a little spider.
