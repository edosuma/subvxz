00:01.930 --> 00:03.864
Previously on "Salem"...

00:04.930 --> 00:07.364
John, where is our son?

00:07.400 --> 00:08.833
COUNTESS MARBURG:
You made the wise decision,

00:08.870 --> 00:10.201
dearest daughter.

00:10.240 --> 00:11.537
MARY: I saw my son die.

00:11.570 --> 00:12.832
(screams)

00:12.880 --> 00:14.404
(growls)

00:14.440 --> 00:17.546
That -- that can't be my son.

00:17.580 --> 00:18.899
BOY: I give you back
your freedom.

00:18.950 --> 00:21.874
Use it to go as far from Salem
as you're able.

00:21.920 --> 00:24.081
You use this finger well.

00:24.120 --> 00:25.917
My sleep produced
only a monster.

00:25.950 --> 00:28.089
(screams)

00:28.120 --> 00:30.554
(screaming)

00:30.590 --> 00:31.921
(birds cawing)

00:35.060 --> 00:36.425
I need your blood
more than you do.

00:36.470 --> 00:37.698
No!
(muffled scream)

00:37.730 --> 00:39.493
Get behind me, child.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.838
Do no more
of your foul magic here!

00:41.870 --> 00:42.768
Who says so?

00:42.810 --> 00:44.334
This is my watch now.

00:44.370 --> 00:46.099
You are a witch.

00:46.140 --> 00:48.005
I had no choice.

00:48.040 --> 00:49.849
And not now.

00:49.880 --> 00:51.575
(squeaking)

00:56.150 --> 00:59.017
Mary Sibley is finished.

00:59.050 --> 01:01.689
Take her out to the woods
and kill her.

01:01.720 --> 01:03.688
If the boy finds
out we killed his mother,

01:03.730 --> 01:05.186
he will destroy us.

01:05.230 --> 01:06.754
He will not know.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.051
And bring me her blood.

01:08.100 --> 01:11.069
Now mother
will think it is done,

01:11.100 --> 01:14.228
but you still have just enough
left if you are careful.

01:14.270 --> 01:15.897
You are free, my love.

01:17.310 --> 01:19.631
MARY: John.
(breathing heavily)

01:19.680 --> 01:22.148

01:24.110 --> 01:25.600
(gasps)

01:25.650 --> 01:28.574
How dare you try
to kill my bride.

01:33.090 --> 01:34.409
Help me.

01:37.590 --> 01:39.899
SEBASTIAN:
Someday perhaps, mother,

01:39.930 --> 01:41.693
but not today.

01:42.930 --> 01:44.124
I love you.

01:44.170 --> 01:45.489
Please, don't go.

01:47.800 --> 01:48.937

01:57.110 --> 01:59.772
* Sickened on Friday

01:59.820 --> 02:03.187
* Died on Saturday

02:03.220 --> 02:05.518
* Buried on Sunday

02:05.550 --> 02:07.484

02:07.520 --> 02:09.522
(thunder cracking)

02:15.630 --> 02:17.996
**

02:32.550 --> 02:36.486
SEBASTIAN: History will say
the Devil was born in Salem.

02:36.520 --> 02:38.545
What is the Devil?

02:38.590 --> 02:42.117
The Devil is the light
that reveals the path

02:42.160 --> 02:45.027
through the dark woods
of desire.

02:45.060 --> 02:46.857
(snake hisses)
After all, getting what we want

02:46.900 --> 02:49.221
is what the craft
of the witch is.

02:50.230 --> 02:52.460
Witchcraft is wish craft,

02:52.500 --> 02:54.639
for our wishes
are hIS Wishes,

02:54.670 --> 02:57.332
and our worlds
shall be his world.

02:59.710 --> 03:01.473
(snake hisses)

03:01.510 --> 03:03.876
Oh, brothers
and sisters gathered here

03:03.910 --> 03:06.242
from every dark place
of the earth.

03:06.280 --> 03:09.886
We have so long been orphans
of the great gone gods,

03:09.920 --> 03:11.387
but no longer.

03:12.260 --> 03:14.478
Our father has come home.

03:14.520 --> 03:18.251
Their God is dead
or lost in senile slumber,

03:18.290 --> 03:19.552
but not ours.

03:19.600 --> 03:22.899
Our god, their Devil,
is alive,

03:22.930 --> 03:26.832
awake, and now, finally...

03:26.870 --> 03:29.998
(snake hisses, rattles)

03:30.040 --> 03:31.530
...he's here.

03:33.940 --> 03:36.909
**

03:36.950 --> 03:39.248
(witches murmuring)

03:41.620 --> 03:44.145
Why do you not kneel,
good mother?

03:45.150 --> 03:48.210
What tribe
of witches is so exalted

03:48.260 --> 03:49.750
that they will not
bend the knee before me?

03:52.160 --> 03:55.095
The Essex witches, my Lord.

03:56.400 --> 03:57.799
It is we Essex

03:57.830 --> 04:01.061
who brought you forth
to walk the earth again.

04:01.100 --> 04:03.898
'Twas my mother, Mary...

04:03.940 --> 04:04.907
of blessed memory.

04:04.940 --> 04:07.773
Yes, Mary Sibley --

04:07.810 --> 04:11.974
the most powerful witch
we Essex ever produced.

04:12.010 --> 04:14.114
Indeed.

04:14.150 --> 04:16.983
What reward is it you crave
for such service?

04:18.120 --> 04:21.283
Only that you be true
to your word.

04:21.320 --> 04:25.723
We performed the grand rite
and the consecration

04:25.760 --> 04:30.493
so that witches might finally
have a land of their own.

04:30.530 --> 04:31.667
Do you see?

04:31.700 --> 04:34.794
This land
is not your land.

04:34.840 --> 04:38.628
This land is my land.

04:38.670 --> 04:40.137
No! No, no, no!

04:40.180 --> 04:41.477
My Lord, no!

04:43.950 --> 04:45.099
My Lord, no!

04:46.180 --> 04:47.977
(screaming)

05:00.030 --> 05:01.691
(thud)

05:02.970 --> 05:05.120
Remember, dear ones,

05:05.170 --> 05:09.368
to the reaper...
all flesh is grass.

05:10.410 --> 05:11.661
Even witch flesh.

05:12.810 --> 05:16.132
A great terror
will soon fall upon Salem,

05:16.180 --> 05:18.671
and there is not
a soul alive

05:18.710 --> 05:21.372
upon this dull earth
who can stop me.

Somebody help me.

Stop trying to see.

Ohh!

07:35.450 --> 07:38.248
PETRUS: You're no more witch
than I was.

07:38.290 --> 07:40.656
We are the cunning ones.

07:42.290 --> 07:46.283
When you ate my eyes,
you swallowed my vision --

07:46.330 --> 07:48.753
my very essence as a Seer.

07:48.800 --> 07:51.621
Now bear the the responsibility
I bore.

07:51.670 --> 07:53.865
See what I see --

07:53.900 --> 07:57.506
what you and the Essex witches
have done

07:57.540 --> 08:00.839
by bringing back
the Devil himself

08:00.880 --> 08:03.201
and handing this earth
over to him.

08:03.250 --> 08:06.845

08:59.130 --> 09:01.837
_ Yet the future
IS not a snngle thread,

09:01.870 --> 09:05.408

And there's only one way
to change the future --

09:09.910 --> 09:13.516
you and Mary Sibley
gave the Devil the earth.

09:13.550 --> 09:18.044
Now you and Mary Sibley

Ah.

beneath a throng.

09:38.470 --> 09:39.903
Indeed.

And how may I help?

09:40.980 --> 09:43.403
Come. See.

09:45.410 --> 09:47.970
Any word yet
on the Countess?

09:48.020 --> 09:51.148
She is, no doubt,
still somewhere mid-ocean.

Duty called.

10:19.650 --> 10:20.912
(people screaming)

10:20.950 --> 10:23.942
That will be
your only warning.

10:27.160 --> 10:28.809
They built a wall
around Eden, too,

10:28.860 --> 10:30.282
and it done no good.

10:30.330 --> 10:32.753
Serpent was already
inside.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.256
So true.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.860
What do you mean by that?

10:36.900 --> 10:38.765
Just worrying
about your reputation, sir.

10:38.800 --> 10:40.199
My reputation?

10:40.240 --> 10:42.868
Yes. I know what a true man
of the people you are.

10:42.910 --> 10:43.865
Indeed.

10:43.910 --> 10:46.162
Seems to me,

10:46.210 --> 10:48.531
a man of the people
is only as big as the people.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.300
So the more people you got
on this side of the fence,

10:52.350 --> 10:53.749
the more man you'll be.

10:55.720 --> 10:57.517

14:35.140 --> 14:37.062
(inhales sharply)

14:38.140 --> 14:39.129
Good boy.

14:40.240 --> 14:42.538
Do you hate me so?

14:45.280 --> 14:46.918
Hate you?

14:46.950 --> 14:48.713
I would --

14:48.750 --> 14:50.513
I have --

14:50.550 --> 14:54.589
given up kingdoms
for you.

14:54.620 --> 14:57.783
My love for you rules
all that I do.

14:57.830 --> 15:01.254
If this is your love,
I hope never to see your hate.

15:03.500 --> 15:06.060
Do not give up, Cotton.

15:06.100 --> 15:08.159
Do not give up on me.

15:09.500 --> 15:11.809
I don't even
know who you are anymore.

15:13.140 --> 15:16.109
I am your Anne, always!

15:18.080 --> 15:20.640
The woman you loved.

15:20.680 --> 15:22.819
I swear
I haven't changed.

15:22.850 --> 15:25.489
I've only become
more capable.

15:25.520 --> 15:27.249
Give me time.
You Will see.

15:27.290 --> 15:29.383
I can do so much.

15:29.420 --> 15:31.251
Can you?

15:32.760 --> 15:35.422
Then do
just one thing for me.

15:35.460 --> 15:36.449
Name it.

15:38.930 --> 15:40.739
Kill me.

15:40.770 --> 15:42.362
SEBASTIAN: Indeed.

15:44.540 --> 15:45.837
Absolutely right.

15:45.870 --> 15:48.100
Kill him now, sister,
or let me.

15:48.140 --> 15:50.847
Far kinder to him,
far safer for us.

15:50.880 --> 15:53.110
You leave him be.

15:53.150 --> 15:54.447
All of Salem questions

15:54.480 --> 15:56.175
the whereabouts
of Reverend Mather.

15:56.220 --> 15:59.439
It's time his body
was found in the forest

15:59.490 --> 16:01.185
or washed up
in the harbor.

16:01.220 --> 16:04.929
His every breath
is an intolerable risk to us...

16:04.960 --> 16:06.689
not to mention
smelling awfully of rat.

16:06.730 --> 16:08.197
Not to me.

16:08.230 --> 16:11.028
I love him.
He is my husband.

16:11.070 --> 16:13.129
(laughs)

16:13.170 --> 16:17.664
Oh, don't let that stop you,
dear brother-in-law.

16:17.710 --> 16:20.304
Voil.
Listen to him.

16:20.340 --> 16:21.375
Stand aside.

16:21.410 --> 16:24.049
He doesn't understand --
not yet.

16:24.080 --> 16:25.968
And neither do you.

16:26.010 --> 16:27.671
Who have you ever
loved but our mother,

16:27.720 --> 16:30.041
and you stood by
and saw her slaughtered.

16:33.520 --> 16:36.910
I have loved and lost
more than you shall ever know.

16:40.830 --> 16:43.560
But we may compare
our sufferings another time.

16:43.600 --> 16:47.058
Right now,
our lord awaits,

16:47.100 --> 16:50.558
and we both know what he does
to those who disappoint him.

16:52.410 --> 16:54.970
(indistinct chatter)

16:55.010 --> 16:56.705
HATHORNE:
I understand your fears.

16:56.740 --> 17:00.312
Our Salem chokes on refugees

17:00.350 --> 17:03.285
as war has heated up out of
nowhere these past few weeks.

17:05.020 --> 17:08.080
But steps are being taken,
I assure you.

17:08.120 --> 17:11.556
Only today, we have captured
the notorious outlaw

17:11.590 --> 17:13.319
John Alden.

17:13.360 --> 17:16.022
Come -- see him hanged.

17:16.060 --> 17:18.699
Oh, sure.
Hang me.

17:18.730 --> 17:19.890
You'll all be scalped

17:19.930 --> 17:22.069
and strung up
by your own innards

17:22.100 --> 17:23.203
within a week.

17:24.540 --> 17:26.030
What do you mean by that?

17:26.070 --> 17:28.334
I've lived in those woods.

17:28.380 --> 17:30.200
I've seen quite a bit.

17:30.250 --> 17:31.842
The Indians and the French

17:31.880 --> 17:34.917
are attacking towns
and forcing refugees our way.

17:34.950 --> 17:37.714
You have no idea
what you're up against.

17:37.750 --> 17:39.889
Just know that the noose
ain't around my neck.

17:41.490 --> 17:42.650
It's around Salem's.

17:44.130 --> 17:46.121
(crowd shouting, cheering)

17:52.070 --> 17:54.959
Sounds like they'd be ready
to see you hanging here as me.

17:56.470 --> 17:58.108
(exhales sharply)

18:00.070 --> 18:02.004
MAN: Lord magistrate!

18:05.280 --> 18:06.440
Our militia --

18:06.480 --> 18:07.913
Your militia

18:07.950 --> 18:09.918
has been decimated
by the plague.

18:09.950 --> 18:11.611
If you think this bunch
of ill-trained geezers

18:11.650 --> 18:14.585
and boys will protect you
from the French and the Indians,

18:14.620 --> 18:15.951
then you are bound
to be disappointed.

18:21.700 --> 18:23.463
(grunts)

18:23.500 --> 18:27.163
How is hanging
John Alden gonna protect us?

18:27.200 --> 18:29.498
(shouting continues)

18:29.540 --> 18:32.202
Who says he's part of it anyway?

18:33.780 --> 18:36.476
-John!
-Free John Alden!

18:36.510 --> 18:37.602
-Release John Alden!
-Let him go!

18:37.650 --> 18:40.005
Hold!

18:40.050 --> 18:41.574
MAN:
Give him his freedom!

18:41.620 --> 18:43.383
He can protect us!

18:50.160 --> 18:52.856
Lead the militia,

18:52.890 --> 18:54.448
and I'll clear your name.

18:57.730 --> 18:59.061
(cheers and applause)

19:07.140 --> 19:08.801
The smell of fear.

19:09.810 --> 19:12.540
Where I am...

19:12.580 --> 19:13.877
war follows.

19:15.220 --> 19:16.812
Your father,

19:16.850 --> 19:18.818
against all odds,
still lives.

19:18.850 --> 19:21.683
My father's nothing now.

19:21.720 --> 19:24.484
He can do nothing
to thwart what is coming.

19:24.530 --> 19:27.351
_ The terror outside
drives refugees Into Salem,

19:27.400 --> 19:31.325
where, soon, they all,
including my dear father,

19:31.370 --> 19:35.033
will be but the burning candles
that ignite my inauguration.

19:35.070 --> 19:38.039
But, my Lord,

19:38.070 --> 19:41.631
how does it serve you
to destroy those you would rule?

19:41.680 --> 19:45.741
Surely we want a new world,
not a dead one.

19:47.680 --> 19:49.477
All good gardeners know

19:49.520 --> 19:51.511
some must die
that others may grow.

19:51.550 --> 19:54.155
-But --
-Patience, dear girl.

19:54.190 --> 19:56.886
In good time,
all shall be revealed.

19:56.920 --> 20:00.083
In the meantime,
you two must play your parts.

20:00.130 --> 20:01.654
Appearances must be maintained.

20:01.700 --> 20:04.521
I understand completely.

20:06.370 --> 20:09.737
My Lord is the surviving nephew
of the late George Sibley,

20:09.770 --> 20:10.930
heir to his throne

20:10.970 --> 20:13.029
and the richest boy
in Salem.

20:13.070 --> 20:15.402
I am your legal guardian,

20:15.440 --> 20:18.409
but I think you may find

20:18.450 --> 20:21.510
my sister seems uncertain
as to her role here,

20:21.550 --> 20:24.678
and she harbors a great danger
to you, Lord --

20:24.720 --> 20:26.415
Cotton Mather.

20:27.960 --> 20:31.885
Cotton Mather --
a formidable soul.

20:33.760 --> 20:36.695
What shall we do with him?

20:36.730 --> 20:38.925
And with you?

20:42.170 --> 20:44.365
When I handed you --

20:44.410 --> 20:48.437
or the boy you would enter --
to my mother,

20:48.480 --> 20:49.902
the Countess promised me --

20:49.940 --> 20:51.874
That overreaching thing,

20:51.910 --> 20:54.708
and all her promises lie,
even now,

20:54.750 --> 20:57.310
rotting in her sarcophagus.

20:58.990 --> 21:00.651
Would you like to join her?

21:00.690 --> 21:02.681
**

21:03.690 --> 21:04.554
You two --

21:04.590 --> 21:07.252
brother and sister --

21:07.300 --> 21:09.894
stand at the threshold
of a new age.

21:09.930 --> 21:11.727
So take my advice --

21:11.770 --> 21:15.991
love each other or die.

21:23.140 --> 21:26.075
(wind whistles)

21:26.110 --> 21:28.112
(rocks clack)

21:29.150 --> 21:30.742
Forgive me, sister.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.087
I, as much as anyone,

21:32.120 --> 21:33.849
put you in this grave,

21:33.890 --> 21:37.451
and now I must drag you
from it.

21:52.410 --> 21:54.401
(insects buzzing)

22:03.420 --> 22:06.344
(indistinct chatter)

22:08.160 --> 22:11.186
ISAAC:
What's become of Mary?

22:11.230 --> 22:13.653
Bet she's halfway
to London by now.

22:14.660 --> 22:16.821
She's smart, that Mary.
She's always --

22:16.860 --> 22:18.191
Isaac.

22:19.930 --> 22:21.033
She's dead.

22:22.400 --> 22:23.401
Dead?

22:25.170 --> 22:26.398
Yeah.

22:27.710 --> 22:29.302
Mary Sibley?

22:29.340 --> 22:31.308
I nearly lay down
in that grave beside her,

22:31.350 --> 22:34.342
but I knew that's not
what she wanted.

22:35.380 --> 22:38.588
For now, we go on...

22:38.620 --> 22:40.759
for her.

22:43.190 --> 22:44.680
(sighs)

22:44.730 --> 22:46.686
(duck quacking)

22:46.730 --> 22:48.721
(indistinct chatter continues)

22:56.440 --> 22:59.204
Imagine what she'd say
if she saw us two --

22:59.240 --> 23:00.730
working for Salem.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.677
I don't know
if she'd rather we kept it safe

23:03.710 --> 23:05.371
or burned it
to the ground.

23:06.810 --> 23:08.539
I think
we're being followed.

23:10.650 --> 23:11.787
Is she yours, Isaac?

23:11.820 --> 23:13.515
Of course not.

23:13.560 --> 23:16.358
Never had no wife,
as you well know, John Alden.

23:16.390 --> 23:19.279
I saved her from that ogress,
Mercy Lewis.

23:19.330 --> 23:21.218
Now I can't shake her.

23:21.260 --> 23:22.955
It's like I gave a puppy
a bone.

23:23.000 --> 23:23.989
Shoo!

23:25.400 --> 23:27.265
This is where you work?

23:29.240 --> 23:30.264
Yep.

23:31.470 --> 23:33.609
Knockers Hole.

23:33.640 --> 23:34.902
My beat.

23:37.950 --> 23:39.372
What do you think
you could do for them?

23:39.410 --> 23:42.243
What no one's ever
done for me --

23:42.280 --> 23:45.317
look after them,
help them.

23:48.860 --> 23:50.282
Listen to me.

23:50.320 --> 23:51.924
When I first came back
to Salem,

23:51.960 --> 23:54.121
you were the one
that told me witches were real

23:54.160 --> 23:55.320
and nobody
was to be trusted.

23:55.360 --> 23:56.554
Oh, I remember.

23:56.600 --> 23:57.760
Well, it's more true
now than ever.

23:57.800 --> 24:00.428
Witches pull
the strings.

24:00.470 --> 24:01.596
There's plenty
who pray to God

24:01.640 --> 24:03.130
but serve the Devil,

24:03.170 --> 24:05.934
and there's damn few of us
that know the truth.

24:05.970 --> 24:10.771
You, me, and Cotton.

24:10.810 --> 24:13.301
When was _the last time
you saw him, anyway?

24:13.350 --> 24:15.341
Been some time.

24:15.380 --> 24:17.245
He hasn't spoken
at Meeting.

24:17.280 --> 24:19.339
Some say
he's gone to Boston.

24:19.390 --> 24:22.211
Some say he ain't left
his marriage bed.

24:26.830 --> 24:30.493
Good Sir Isaac the Idiot.

24:30.530 --> 24:32.896
What comfort
you must bring to the weak.

24:40.640 --> 24:43.370
**

24:48.180 --> 24:50.171
(valve squeaks)

25:01.260 --> 25:03.251
(indistinct chatter)

25:07.200 --> 25:09.339
Alice,
I'm glad you came.

25:11.740 --> 25:13.105
(birds chirping)

25:23.050 --> 25:24.244
MERCY:
Get your strength back.

25:25.720 --> 25:26.846
Mercy, Alice is here.

25:26.890 --> 25:28.380
No work for you tonight.

25:35.960 --> 25:37.962
Now,
who do we have here?

25:39.700 --> 25:42.533
A little lost bird
for my little nest?

25:44.410 --> 25:45.763
Oh.

25:47.810 --> 25:48.970
Come.

25:54.780 --> 25:56.748
(birds chirping)

25:56.780 --> 25:58.782
(sniffles)

26:03.120 --> 26:04.621
There, there, now.

26:04.660 --> 26:07.151
You're safe here.

26:11.730 --> 26:14.790
But you must tell me everything
so I can help.

26:23.650 --> 26:26.949
My parents
died of the plague.

26:26.980 --> 26:29.414
My Uncle took me
to Knockers Hole

26:29.450 --> 26:32.146
and...found men for me.

26:34.790 --> 26:36.815
Only he drinks
all the money...

26:39.190 --> 26:40.225
...and I'm afraid.

26:40.260 --> 26:42.728
Shh.

26:42.760 --> 26:45.593
I was a lost bird, myself,
once upon a time,

26:45.630 --> 26:48.030
and there was no nest
to hide me, so I built one.

26:48.940 --> 26:52.103
_ And now
there Will always be a place

26:52.140 --> 26:55.177
for lost doves like you
in my house.

26:56.480 --> 26:58.846
As long as you allow me
my fair share.

26:58.880 --> 27:00.302
You can have the money.

27:00.350 --> 27:03.615
I just want to be safe
(sniffles) and fed and warm.

27:07.120 --> 27:08.109
Come.

27:19.030 --> 27:21.533
It isn't your earnings
I want a share of.

27:24.210 --> 27:26.166
But let's talk
about that later.

27:30.340 --> 27:34.174
You _Will never have _
to deal With your uncle again.

27:34.220 --> 27:35.209
I promise.

27:40.690 --> 27:42.385
Where is he now?

27:45.360 --> 27:48.158
Still snoring
in his drunken sleep.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.491
Are you familiar
with Cat's Cradle?

27:54.000 --> 27:56.696
I used to play
Cat's Cradle when I was a girl.

27:58.840 --> 28:00.569
Let's play.

28:00.610 --> 28:01.907
One...

Tighter.

28:31.440 --> 28:33.237

28:33.270 --> 28:35.170
Five.

28:35.210 --> 28:38.008
(bones cracking)

28:38.050 --> 28:38.869
That's it.

28:42.120 --> 28:43.644
Six.

28:47.120 --> 28:48.155
Seven.

28:49.790 --> 28:50.927
Eight.

29:05.470 --> 29:06.960
(Groans)
-Through a Window.

29:14.950 --> 29:16.918
(sighs)

29:27.590 --> 29:32.220
WOMAN: How dare you bring
that traitor into our midst.

29:32.270 --> 29:34.932
There is no place
in the Essex stronghold

29:34.970 --> 29:37.097
for even the corpse
of Mary Sibley.

29:38.710 --> 29:40.735
How dare you.

29:40.770 --> 29:42.704
She didn't bring this on us.
You did.

29:44.480 --> 29:47.347
We drew her deeper
with every step,

29:47.380 --> 29:50.019
and now
you would blame her?

29:50.050 --> 29:52.041
(grunts)

29:54.860 --> 29:59.854
But the father of lies
betrayed us all.

29:59.890 --> 30:01.949
I have seen it.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.968
(Wind Whistling,
creature screeches)

30:04.000 --> 30:06.798
Seen the future
that we have built

30:06.830 --> 30:09.298
in our thirst for revenge.

30:09.340 --> 30:12.434
We have brought him back only
to murder our own world

30:12.470 --> 30:14.677
and ourselves with it...

30:14.710 --> 30:15.972
unless we can stop him.

30:16.010 --> 30:18.501
But it is impossible.

30:18.550 --> 30:20.472
Not all of us together

30:20.510 --> 30:23.445
have any hope
of stopping him.

30:23.480 --> 30:24.481
No.

30:25.750 --> 30:28.014
She, alone, does.

30:28.060 --> 30:32.121
You know better
than any of us

30:32.160 --> 30:35.049
how dangerous it is to breech
the wall of silence.

30:36.360 --> 30:38.123
Raise the dead

30:38.170 --> 30:40.468
and you never know
What you raise.

30:40.500 --> 30:42.832
We all know
What we have done,

30:42.870 --> 30:45.031
and we all know
that this --

30:45.070 --> 30:46.935
this is our only chance.

30:51.050 --> 30:52.847
(insects chirping)

30:52.880 --> 30:54.871
Go get some more wood.

30:58.920 --> 31:00.319
(insects buzzing)

31:00.350 --> 31:02.386
(thunder cracks)

31:06.130 --> 31:08.121
(buzzing intensifies)

31:12.370 --> 31:13.769
(muffled scream)

31:24.810 --> 31:26.801
(thunder cracks)

31:35.390 --> 31:38.382
**

31:42.560 --> 31:45.358
(fire crackling)

31:45.400 --> 31:48.062
(door opens)

31:48.100 --> 31:49.965
ANNE: We can
find happiness, Cotton,

31:50.000 --> 31:53.128
if only you would stop fighting
and give me a chance.

32:01.580 --> 32:02.774
I will not be used
like this.

32:02.820 --> 32:03.775
Do you hear me?

32:03.820 --> 32:05.981
IfI cannot be a free man,

32:06.020 --> 32:07.885
I will make you kill me.

32:07.920 --> 32:10.081
-Enough!
-(gasps)

32:10.120 --> 32:12.281
(panﬁng)

32:12.330 --> 32:14.093
Enough.

32:15.160 --> 32:17.128
Do you think
I want to do this?

32:17.160 --> 32:20.994
You have no idea --

32:21.040 --> 32:23.429
no idea at all
What is coming.

32:23.470 --> 32:25.961
Even I know
only a fraction,

32:26.010 --> 32:29.502
but I am deeply afraid
of what he may do.

32:32.450 --> 32:35.339
I cannot fight you, too.

32:37.220 --> 32:38.312
(pounding on door)
JOHN: Anne!

32:38.350 --> 32:39.942
John. Jo--

32:47.660 --> 32:50.220
(pounding on door)
Anne Hale!

32:57.870 --> 32:59.508
(breathing heavily)

32:59.540 --> 33:00.632
Where's Mather?

33:00.670 --> 33:03.138
Bo_ston --
a family matter.

33:16.660 --> 33:17.957
(exhales sharply)

33:17.990 --> 33:19.355
Open it.

33:19.390 --> 33:21.654
I will call the Magistrate
and have you arrested.

33:21.700 --> 33:23.850
And What can the army
do to me

33:23.900 --> 33:27.495
that you can't,
Witch?

33:30.400 --> 33:32.630
If you know so much,
Why don't you tell everyone?

33:32.670 --> 33:36.470
Well, it took me a While,
but I figured it out.

33:36.510 --> 33:38.842
The Puritans
are all puppets.

33:38.880 --> 33:40.302
Even the ones
who don't know it.

33:40.350 --> 33:42.739
(door rattles)

33:42.780 --> 33:44.486
How did he take it,

33:44.520 --> 33:47.387
when you admitted
you were a Witch?

33:47.420 --> 33:49.752
I think you hate
What you've become.

33:49.790 --> 33:51.348
You're in too deep,
and you don't know What to do.

33:51.390 --> 33:53.927
-I've no choice --
-Ch0ice?!

33:53.960 --> 33:56.224
Bullshit.

33:56.260 --> 33:58.592
Choice
is all any of us have,

33:58.630 --> 34:00.495
and you chose
to send that boy,

34:00.530 --> 34:03.090
my boy...

34:03.140 --> 34:04.869
over to the Countess,

34:04.910 --> 34:07.936
who made him into
Whatever the hell he is now.

34:07.970 --> 34:11.679
Did I choose
to slaughter innocents?

34:11.710 --> 34:13.871
Choose to start a plague?

34:13.910 --> 34:16.174
Raise the Devil himself?

34:16.220 --> 34:17.847
No.

34:17.880 --> 34:20.610
Mary Sibley
chose to do those things.

34:24.160 --> 34:26.128
Me?
I had no choice.

34:26.160 --> 34:28.355
Didn't even realize
I was born a Witch,

34:28.400 --> 34:31.722
but Mary Sibley chose
to become a witch.

34:31.770 --> 34:33.897
Why?

34:33.930 --> 34:36.967
Because you chose
to leave Salem

34:37.000 --> 34:38.399
and left her
no other course.

34:38.440 --> 34:41.204
So perhaps
this is all your fault.

34:41.240 --> 34:42.901
(grunting)

34:42.940 --> 34:46.569
Everything I've done,
I've done for love --

34:46.610 --> 34:48.077
even giving up the boy.

34:48.120 --> 34:50.270
I did it to save Cotton.

34:50.320 --> 34:52.811
They were going to kill him!

34:52.850 --> 34:54.989
(strained)
Like you're killing me?

34:55.020 --> 34:56.055
(neck cracking)

34:56.090 --> 34:58.320
(gagging)

34:58.360 --> 35:00.658
(gasps)

35:00.690 --> 35:02.419
(groans)

35:04.430 --> 35:07.763
Get out
before I change my mind.

35:09.800 --> 35:11.768
**

35:34.230 --> 35:36.152
I know you don't care,

35:36.200 --> 35:38.919
but seeing John Alden alive
and walking in our Salem

35:38.970 --> 35:40.961
is like a dagger.

35:41.000 --> 35:44.128
I can't look at that man
Without thinking of Mary.

35:44.170 --> 35:46.104
BOY:
In grief begins Wisdom.

35:46.140 --> 35:48.176
I should know.

35:48.210 --> 35:51.373
I lived on nothing but grief
for thousands of starless nights

35:51.410 --> 35:52.570
in the darkness.

35:55.080 --> 35:57.719
But you must not
lose yourself in grief,

35:57.750 --> 36:00.139
rather,
find yourself.

36:10.400 --> 36:12.391
(gags)

36:13.330 --> 36:15.389
What is this rancid wine?

36:15.440 --> 36:17.567
It's no Wine I sip.

36:17.600 --> 36:18.908
It's my mother's blood.

36:18.940 --> 36:21.534
I draw a small cup nightly

36:21.580 --> 36:24.549
from the sack of blood
you yourself drew from her.

36:24.580 --> 36:27.401
Makes me feel closer
to her.

36:27.450 --> 36:29.748
Try it again.

36:29.780 --> 36:33.580
Open your mouth
and your heart,

36:33.620 --> 36:37.056
and you'll feel her
as I do.

36:39.790 --> 36:41.599
(exhales shakily)

36:41.630 --> 36:43.621
Now you feel her,
don't you?

36:49.600 --> 36:51.739
Her flesh may be dead,
but her spirit,

36:51.770 --> 36:55.103
Whether on this earth
or beneath it, still exists.

36:55.140 --> 36:58.473
But remember,
she belongs to me.

36:59.880 --> 37:02.815
You shall never_
know her lips again.

37:08.720 --> 37:09.789
Oh, mother,

37:09.820 --> 37:13.381
Wise, Wise mother.

37:15.400 --> 37:18.267
Answer me this --

37:18.300 --> 37:21.064
how can such things be?

37:21.100 --> 37:25.059
Mary is gone,
but John Alden still lives.

37:27.140 --> 37:30.405
She's the only thing
I ever wanted.

37:37.250 --> 37:39.548
I even stood by
and watched you die

37:39.590 --> 37:41.455
in hopes of seeing her again.

37:41.490 --> 37:46.427
Now she's gone,
and I have nothing.

37:47.660 --> 37:48.649
Nothing.

37:50.360 --> 37:52.999
WOMEN:
From cloud to sea,

37:53.030 --> 37:54.736
from crown to throne.

37:54.770 --> 37:56.089
from blood to bough,

37:56.140 --> 37:57.232
from skin to bone.

37:57.270 --> 38:00.433
Tree of life
in which we art,

38:00.470 --> 38:02.609
roots that feed
from earth's deep heart.

38:02.640 --> 38:05.609
rising branches
charged from slq,

38:05.650 --> 38:07.572
come now, make her death a lie.

38:07.610 --> 38:09.669
From cloud to sea,

38:09.720 --> 38:11.483
from crown to throne.

38:11.520 --> 38:14.580
From blood to bough,
from skin to bone.

38:14.620 --> 38:15.951
Tree of life in which we art,

38:15.990 --> 38:18.754
roots that feed
from earth's deep heart.

38:18.790 --> 38:20.758
Rising branches
charged from slq,

38:20.790 --> 38:23.827
come now, make her death a lie.

38:29.540 --> 38:31.565
(indistinct chatter)

38:34.480 --> 38:35.504
MAN: (laughs)

38:42.250 --> 38:44.172
(pig grunting)

39:01.070 --> 39:02.731
What happened here?

39:07.110 --> 39:09.408
Does anybody know
this man's name?

39:09.440 --> 39:12.045
Does anybody
know this man's name?!

39:16.550 --> 39:19.917
You were right
about one thing, my husband.

39:22.260 --> 39:24.581
We cannot go on this way.

39:24.630 --> 39:27.485
Neither backward
nor forward.

39:27.530 --> 39:29.452
You once told me that...

39:32.300 --> 39:36.191
...that love could not
be known by reason,

39:36.240 --> 39:39.562
that it required
only a faith.

39:43.880 --> 39:47.748
Well, I will take that leap,
and I will trust you.

39:47.780 --> 39:49.475
(breathes deeply)

39:55.820 --> 39:58.755
And you must try
and trust me, too.

40:04.600 --> 40:05.589
Can you?

40:12.010 --> 40:14.001
**

40:28.250 --> 40:29.512
Yes.

40:31.420 --> 40:32.682
I can try.

40:52.680 --> 40:55.274
I hope this is
a new beginning for us.

40:57.480 --> 40:59.209
We deserve it.

41:04.460 --> 41:05.950
Yes, we do.

41:08.290 --> 41:10.019
My dear Anne...

41:10.060 --> 41:11.925
(chuckles)

41:11.970 --> 41:13.494
...thank you.

41:15.300 --> 41:18.531
Are you...

41:18.570 --> 41:20.162
coming to bed?

41:21.310 --> 41:22.834
Shortly.

41:22.880 --> 41:24.973
(sniffles)

41:25.010 --> 41:27.103
I must first
enjoy the feeling

41:27.150 --> 41:29.948
of free movement
for a moment.

41:29.980 --> 41:32.448
(chuckles)

41:32.490 --> 41:33.980
And, um,
if you don't mind,

41:34.020 --> 41:36.454
say a few prayers
of thanks

41:36.490 --> 41:39.152
to whatever god
opened up your heart.

41:41.900 --> 41:44.926
**

42:04.050 --> 42:06.041
(choir chanting in Latin)

42:54.230 --> 42:56.539
Finally, brother,
you are here.

42:56.570 --> 42:59.607
Nostoah nanaeel
olani noasmi --

42:59.640 --> 43:01.267
Stop.

43:01.310 --> 43:05.201
I haven't heard
the old tongue in eons.

43:05.250 --> 43:08.139
I can't say
that I like it.

43:08.180 --> 43:10.239
Too many memories.

43:10.280 --> 43:12.783
But I quite like
this one --

43:12.820 --> 43:14.481
English.
English.

43:15.960 --> 43:18.485
English.

43:18.520 --> 43:21.557
That's What it is.

43:21.590 --> 43:25.469
Better call it "anguish."
(chuckles)

43:25.500 --> 43:28.060
Sounds like the whimper
of whipped dogs.

43:28.100 --> 43:30.068
(chuckles)

43:30.100 --> 43:34.332
I see your long entombment
has not improved your mood.

43:35.710 --> 43:40.602
For once, old friend,
rejoice.

43:40.650 --> 43:41.878
It has begun.

43:43.680 --> 43:46.080
Once,
we raised an army of brothers

43:46.120 --> 43:48.987
and stormed
the very Citadel of Heaven.

43:49.020 --> 43:50.351
(door opens)
We all know
how that ended --

43:50.390 --> 43:53.826
in the bowels
of newly formed Hell,

43:53.860 --> 43:56.328
so I've seen
new beginnings before.

43:56.360 --> 43:58.920
Forgive me if I hold my tongue,
this time,

43:58.970 --> 44:00.790
for a successful end.

44:03.800 --> 44:05.461
(insects chirping)

44:05.510 --> 44:07.466
(indistinct conversations)

44:12.250 --> 44:14.002
Leave the bottle.

44:14.050 --> 44:15.472
(bottle thuds)

44:15.520 --> 44:19.149
**

44:19.190 --> 44:20.987
(sighs)

44:58.760 --> 44:59.954
(grunts)

45:04.300 --> 45:06.291
**

45:13.440 --> 45:14.532
(screaming)

45:23.220 --> 45:25.245
Come back inside,
and it will stop.

45:25.290 --> 45:27.918
What are you doing to me?

45:27.950 --> 45:31.579
Not I, but Brown Jenkins.

45:32.930 --> 45:33.988
Your familiar.

45:35.900 --> 45:38.551
Faithful to me
and me alone.

45:40.770 --> 45:42.738
Far, far more trustworthy
than you.

45:45.440 --> 45:48.136
I gave you a simple test,
and you failed.

45:48.170 --> 45:50.604
I left you free
to move and speak.

45:52.250 --> 45:55.242
If you move or speak
against me,

45:55.280 --> 45:57.578
Brown Jenkins feasts
on your in5ides.

46:00.650 --> 46:02.709
You have me in a prison.

46:02.760 --> 46:04.648
No, clear Cotton,

46:04.690 --> 46:06.658
I have a prison inside you.

46:09.260 --> 46:10.955
Now come to bed.

46:11.000 --> 46:13.764
(indistinct conversations)

46:13.800 --> 46:17.338
I have no intention
of causmg a scene here.

46:17.370 --> 46:19.304
I'd merely have words
with you, Captain.

46:21.440 --> 46:23.476
We've got nothing
to talk about.

46:23.510 --> 46:24.875
Mary Sibley.

46:25.780 --> 46:26.974
Where is she?

46:29.520 --> 46:30.839
I buried her...

46:32.490 --> 46:35.050
but you killed her.

46:39.290 --> 46:41.281
