-[beeps]
-[typing]

00:34.375 --> 00:35.416
-[beeps]
-Uh, yeah.

00:35.500 --> 00:38.000
For this video today,
I will be switching into English

00:38.083 --> 00:41.375
for my international friends and fans.

00:41.458 --> 00:46.708
The story I will be telling you today
is one of my absolute favorites,

00:47.208 --> 00:51.416
and, um, I hope you too
will get great enjoyment out of it,

00:52.291 --> 00:53.625
like I do.

00:54.500 --> 00:55.875
[captivating music playing]

00:55.958 --> 01:00.291
Once upon a time,
in a faraway land called Munich…

01:00.375 --> 01:03.875
[clears throat] Far away, that is,
if you're one of my international friends.

01:04.500 --> 01:08.166
There was an old brick building
on the edge of the city.

01:09.416 --> 01:13.041
The building was the factory
of a respectable locksmith

01:13.791 --> 01:15.791
named Hans Wagner.

01:16.416 --> 01:21.541
He was once a hard-working family man,
a pillar of the community,

01:21.625 --> 01:24.625
until his wife and son died tragically.

01:25.833 --> 01:29.208
In his waning years,
his greatest work truly began.

01:29.708 --> 01:35.708
A series of four safes, one for each opera
of Richard Wagner's legendary Ring cycle,

01:35.791 --> 01:40.083
comprised of four epic operas
with roots in Norse mythology.

01:41.250 --> 01:42.916
The four safes being…

01:44.041 --> 01:45.083
Das Rheingold,

01:46.708 --> 01:49.250
Die Walküre or The Valkyrie,

01:50.875 --> 01:52.416
the Siegfried…

01:54.291 --> 01:57.083
and finally the Götterdämmerung,

01:57.791 --> 02:00.416
also known as the Twilight of the Gods.

02:02.375 --> 02:06.666
To Hans Wagner,
a lock, a safe, were puzzles.

02:07.875 --> 02:10.166
Puzzles that could only be solved

02:10.250 --> 02:13.833
by those truly worthy
of the secrets they guarded.

02:15.500 --> 02:18.750
Legend has it, if you attempt
to crack the locks by force,

02:19.375 --> 02:21.208
the contents will be incinerated

02:22.916 --> 02:24.416
and they will lock forever.

02:26.375 --> 02:29.458
But Hans' work did not end
with the Ring cycle.

02:29.541 --> 02:31.125
He had one more safe to build.

02:32.125 --> 02:34.791
The safe his whole life
had been leading to,

02:34.875 --> 02:38.541
capable of containing
all his anguish and misery,

02:39.458 --> 02:40.916
locking it away for good.

02:43.958 --> 02:47.958
People tried to liberate Wagner
from the tomb he had built for himself,

02:48.750 --> 02:51.166
but his work was pure enough
that they could not.

02:52.666 --> 02:55.666
The safe that Wagner died in
was never opened.

02:56.333 --> 03:01.708
It served as his tomb and was dropped
into the ocean with his body still inside.

03:02.875 --> 03:03.916
The Rheingold,

03:04.416 --> 03:06.541
the Valkyrie, and the Siegfried

03:06.625 --> 03:09.333
are all rumored
to still be in circulation.

03:09.833 --> 03:13.958
Their locations remain one of the greatest
mysteries of the safecracking world.

03:14.625 --> 03:19.000
As for the Götterdämmerung,
no one knows what became of it.

03:19.500 --> 03:20.875
[camera clattering]

03:21.875 --> 03:24.833
Okay. Yes, this has been my video.
Thank you for the viewing.

03:24.916 --> 03:29.416
And as always, I've been
your, uh, Sebastian Schlencht-Wöhnert,

03:29.500 --> 03:31.666
your super safecracker. Please like

03:32.583 --> 03:36.416

03:36.500 --> 03:37.458
That's it.

03:38.125 --> 03:40.708
Thank you and goodbye.

03:42.666 --> 03:44.625
[in German] Perfect. That was perfect.

03:45.208 --> 03:47.583
And upload. [sniffles]

03:47.666 --> 03:48.833
Tick.

04:04.458 --> 04:05.541
[sighs]

04:18.375 --> 04:19.666
Okay, and…

04:21.500 --> 04:24.666
Time to start another boring day.

04:25.625 --> 04:27.333
[exhilarating music playing]

04:57.541 --> 04:58.541
[bell chimes]

05:03.333 --> 05:05.500
-[man speaking German]
-Thank you.

05:07.458 --> 05:08.916
Here you go.

05:21.500 --> 05:23.958
[alarm ringing]

05:24.041 --> 05:26.333
OPEN

05:26.416 --> 05:29.166
A very good morning. How can I be of help?

05:29.250 --> 05:32.875
Now listen up, young man!

05:32.958 --> 05:36.958
In the old days
everything was better, far better…

05:37.041 --> 05:38.666
[continues indistinctly]

05:52.208 --> 05:53.458
[shouting indistinctly]

06:00.125 --> 06:01.000
[mutters]

06:20.333 --> 06:21.250
[beeps]

06:24.333 --> 06:26.125
CLOSED

06:27.500 --> 06:28.916
-I'm taking my lunch break.
-[chuckles]

06:38.041 --> 06:39.000
[laptop chimes]

06:43.166 --> 06:44.125
[sighs]

06:46.208 --> 06:47.166
[laptop chimes]

06:49.000 --> 06:49.958
Wait.

06:52.500 --> 06:53.375
[chuckles]

06:54.416 --> 06:55.750
[in English] Oh, my God.

06:56.375 --> 06:57.208
Uh…

06:57.791 --> 06:59.500
"Want to put your skills to the test?"

06:59.583 --> 07:01.458
"The house at the end
of Leipziger Str. Berlin."

07:01.541 --> 07:03.208
"Password: Götterdämmerung."

07:03.291 --> 07:04.625
[thrilling music playing]

07:39.541 --> 07:40.458
[in German] Hello, I'm…

07:40.541 --> 07:42.125
[breath trembling]

07:42.208 --> 07:44.541
I'm not sure if this is the right address,

07:44.625 --> 07:47.500
but I'm here for a very
[whispers] secret issue.

07:47.583 --> 07:48.583
Do you understand?

07:49.875 --> 07:52.500
[in English] You understand? English?

07:53.250 --> 07:54.208
Okay… [clears throat]

07:54.291 --> 07:59.666
[whispers] I'm here
for, um, a very secret thing.

08:00.833 --> 08:03.958
I was told to say
[whispers] Götterdämmerung.

08:07.916 --> 08:09.416
Götterdämmerung?

08:12.791 --> 08:15.041
[whispers] Götterdämmerung.

08:20.875 --> 08:24.333
[announcer] Who's ready
for the main event?

08:24.416 --> 08:25.416
[audience cheering]

08:29.000 --> 08:33.833
[announcer] Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome our final competitor.

08:34.500 --> 08:37.625
-[announcer] Give him a big hand.
-[audience cheering]

08:40.125 --> 08:43.666
Sebastian Schlencht… [hesitates]

08:44.416 --> 08:46.833
I don't know how the fuck
you pronounce that last name.

08:46.916 --> 08:48.000
[all laughing]

08:48.583 --> 08:50.833
Me? Is it me she's talking about?

08:51.416 --> 08:53.000
-Of course. Go to work.
-[metal clanks]

08:53.083 --> 08:54.541
-What?
-[announcer] Take your place.

08:54.625 --> 08:56.916
-Ladies and gentlemen…
-Hello, uh, sir.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.250
-[announcer] …place your final bets.
-My name is Sebastian.

08:59.333 --> 09:02.000
May I ask what the hell is going on here?

09:04.125 --> 09:06.583
-[announcer] The clock is set.
-Thank you.

09:06.666 --> 09:10.500
Ready, and crack!

09:12.958 --> 09:14.416

09:17.416 --> 09:22.208

competitors advance to the next stage.

[whispering indistinctly]

09:32.791 --> 09:33.833
[audience cheering]

09:33.916 --> 09:36.500
And contestant number one is finished.

09:37.791 --> 09:40.416
Three more slots still to be won.

09:41.041 --> 09:44.541
-Oh, wait. Oh, and now it's two.
-[audience cheering]

09:45.875 --> 09:47.541
[announcer] Time's running.

09:52.541 --> 09:54.041
-[audience cheering]
-Yeah!

09:55.125 --> 09:56.583
[announcer] One more slot.

10:03.583 --> 10:05.500
-That's it.
-[audience cheering]

10:07.708 --> 10:13.000
[announcer] If your safe remains locked,
please leave the floor.

10:15.958 --> 10:18.958
Four contestants left for the semifinals.

10:19.458 --> 10:20.375
Fireball,

10:20.458 --> 10:21.833
Valiant,

10:21.916 --> 10:22.916
Neo,

10:23.875 --> 10:27.291
-and Mr. Nervous Guy.
-[audience cheering]

10:30.458 --> 10:32.791
-[announcer] Quiet please.
-[cheering stops]

10:35.250 --> 10:36.458
[announcer] The clock is set.

10:36.958 --> 10:38.166
Ready,

10:39.416 --> 10:42.583

11:00.375 --> 11:01.500

11:08.916 --> 11:09.833
[thumps]

11:10.416 --> 11:12.416
[announcer] Neo's on to the second dial.

11:12.500 --> 11:13.458
[audience cheering]

11:15.583 --> 11:17.625
[announcer] And so is Mr. Nervous Guy.

11:22.083 --> 11:23.458
[gears turning]

11:27.791 --> 11:29.041
[audience cheering]

11:32.791 --> 11:35.041
Whoo!

11:36.875 --> 11:38.625
[audience continues cheering]

11:40.916 --> 11:44.916
A second place finish
from Mr. Nervous Guy.

11:45.916 --> 11:48.708
Could we be looking at a new champion?

11:51.666 --> 11:52.708
[suspenseful music playing]

11:52.791 --> 11:55.458
[announcer] Your bets please.
Place your bets.

11:56.708 --> 11:59.708
The clock is set for three minutes.

12:00.250 --> 12:04.666
If neither competitor finishes,
we default to a tie.

12:04.750 --> 12:06.791
[exhilarating music playing]

12:07.625 --> 12:08.583
[announcer] Ready,

12:10.083 --> 12:11.250

12:25.916 --> 12:27.125
[sighs]

12:32.291 --> 12:33.208
[inhales]

12:35.958 --> 12:37.708
[heart thumping]

12:46.333 --> 12:47.458
[whispers] Already?

12:51.125 --> 12:52.958
[whispers] That's a difficult one.

12:58.250 --> 13:00.791
Wow. Oh, no, only one minute left,

13:01.625 --> 13:03.458
but I haven't even started
to crack my safe yet.

13:03.541 --> 13:05.333
Yeah, probably because you don't know how.

13:07.500 --> 13:10.083
[whispers] Hey.
So this is bad news for me, isn't it?

13:11.375 --> 13:13.500
-I just want to clarify once more--
-Zip it!

13:13.583 --> 13:16.208
[whispers] Okay. If you say so.

13:18.333 --> 13:20.500
-[buzzer sounds]
-[beeping]

13:25.541 --> 13:27.458
[captivating music playing]

13:35.666 --> 13:36.666
[thumping]

13:55.250 --> 13:59.166
Ladies and gentlemen,
there's a new kid in town!

13:59.250 --> 14:00.375
[audience cheering]

14:06.208 --> 14:08.000
I love you, Nervous Guy!

14:10.666 --> 14:12.791
It's just training and a lot of practice.

14:12.875 --> 14:14.708
I'm gonna kill you!

14:14.791 --> 14:19.166
I'm gonna kill you! I'll kill you!
I'll kill you, you little shit!

14:21.500 --> 14:22.500
Thank you.

14:23.958 --> 14:25.083
Thank you.

14:27.916 --> 14:29.875
[suspenseful music playing]

14:31.500 --> 14:33.875
[Sebastian] That was when I first saw her.

14:33.958 --> 14:35.916
The woman I would come to know
as Gwendoline.

14:37.375 --> 14:40.541
The woman who would change my life.

14:41.833 --> 14:45.458
Eventually, I would come
to learn so many things about her.

14:45.541 --> 14:49.583
For instance, that she was six years old
when she stole her first wristwatch.

14:50.166 --> 14:53.500
That she was 16
when she first got her heart broken.

14:53.583 --> 14:56.125
And when she stole her first car.

14:56.208 --> 14:57.625
[exhilarating music playing]

14:59.333 --> 15:03.000
I would learn that she had a red notice
from Interpol since she was 17.

15:05.458 --> 15:10.041
But at that moment, in that basement,
I didn't know any of that.

15:10.875 --> 15:14.166
All I knew was
of all the people in that basement,

15:14.250 --> 15:16.416
she was the one smiling at me.

15:16.500 --> 15:18.125
[audience cheering]

15:24.208 --> 15:25.208
Thank you!

15:25.708 --> 15:29.458
I have absolutely zero idea
what's going on, but thank you.

15:30.083 --> 15:32.000
Whoo-hoo!

15:32.083 --> 15:33.000
Thank you.

15:34.458 --> 15:35.458
[music stops]

15:52.500 --> 15:53.625

15:54.750 --> 15:56.583
[solemn music playing]

16:18.208 --> 16:19.625
[exhilarating music playing]

16:26.375 --> 16:27.291
[in German] Thank you.

16:28.916 --> 16:29.916
Thanks.

16:30.625 --> 16:31.791
[in English] Hello, Sebastian.

16:32.666 --> 16:34.750
[screams]

16:34.833 --> 16:37.041
[in German] Damn it!

16:44.625 --> 16:46.250
[in English] Hold on, I know you.

16:47.500 --> 16:49.333
You were at the strange house last night.

16:50.500 --> 16:53.625
Sebastian, I am the reason
you were there last night.

16:56.375 --> 16:57.416
[Sebastian] Oh, my God.

16:57.500 --> 17:00.291
You were my one view on YouTube,
weren't you?

17:00.375 --> 17:01.416
[Gwendoline] That's right.

17:01.500 --> 17:04.625
And may I say what a shame that is.

17:04.708 --> 17:06.916
Your videos are damn fine, Sebastian.

17:07.666 --> 17:08.791
Thank you. I know.

17:10.083 --> 17:13.291
[smacks lips] But, permit me to ask then,

17:14.458 --> 17:15.625
who are you?

17:19.000 --> 17:21.250
I am the woman who is going
to change your life.

17:22.666 --> 17:23.750
Forever.

17:25.041 --> 17:25.916
[gulps] Gulp.

17:26.583 --> 17:27.833
Did you just say "gulp"?

17:28.500 --> 17:31.208
Yes, I, uh… I said it and I did it. Yes.

17:32.666 --> 17:34.000
You wish to know who I am.

17:34.708 --> 17:37.708
You wish to know how I knew
you were going to be in this cafe

17:37.791 --> 17:39.250
at this time on this morning.

17:39.333 --> 17:41.583
I would like to know
all of those things, yes.

17:42.625 --> 17:44.708
I know those things
because I've been watching you.

17:45.583 --> 17:49.958
I know you stop here
between 8:43 and 8:47 every morning,

17:50.041 --> 17:53.916
get a banana nut muffin
and a coffee and eat it alone.

17:54.666 --> 17:57.791
And then you go to work and go home alone.

17:58.875 --> 17:59.708
As for who I am,

17:59.791 --> 18:02.958
I have been in this coffee shop
for no more than seven minutes.

18:03.041 --> 18:05.166
Do you see that woman over my shoulder?

18:05.250 --> 18:06.666
[giggling]

18:06.750 --> 18:09.291
-I see her.
-This is her wedding ring.

18:10.625 --> 18:12.541
And that man three tables to my right…

18:13.208 --> 18:14.208
[moans]

18:15.250 --> 18:16.625
…this is his watch.

18:16.708 --> 18:18.291
And the dude in the back corner…

18:21.333 --> 18:23.833
-[gasps] Are you crazy?
-This is the concealed handgun

18:23.916 --> 18:25.416
he had strapped to his inner thigh.

18:26.958 --> 18:28.833
You want to know who I am, Sebastian.

18:30.208 --> 18:33.958
Well, there is no way to say this
that will make it sound not insane.

18:34.041 --> 18:36.000
And so I'm simply just going to say it.

18:37.583 --> 18:39.833
I am an internationally-wanted
jewelry thief,

18:40.541 --> 18:43.666
and I belong to a crew
that executes international bank heists.

18:44.916 --> 18:46.375
And I want to recruit you.

18:48.791 --> 18:50.750
Oh, and don't worry about these.

18:51.500 --> 18:54.916
I will, uh,
return them to their proper owners.

18:56.750 --> 18:57.958
Oh, well, maybe not the gun.

18:58.041 --> 19:00.958
[chuckles] Shouldn't have brought that
into a family establishment.

19:02.750 --> 19:04.958
[laughing]

19:15.500 --> 19:16.666
Am I being spunked?

19:16.750 --> 19:18.875
"Spunked"? What do you mean?

19:18.958 --> 19:20.541
You know what I mean. Spunked.

19:21.166 --> 19:22.958
[sighs] Do you mean "punked"?

19:25.458 --> 19:29.291
No, you're not being punked
or spunked. This is real.

19:30.958 --> 19:33.250
[whispers] But why me? I am no criminal.

19:33.333 --> 19:38.416
Because the next job we intend to take on,
you are the only one who can pull it off.

19:39.666 --> 19:44.041
Nobody knows more than you do
about Hans Wagner.

19:44.958 --> 19:47.458
And now that I know
you've got the skills to match,

19:48.041 --> 19:49.416
I think you're the man for the job.

19:50.666 --> 19:52.291
-[gulps] Gulp.
-Please stop saying "gulp."

19:52.375 --> 19:54.208
-I'm nervous.
-It's okay if you do it.

19:54.291 --> 19:55.791
But saying it is incredibly stupid.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.291
Okay, so… [clears throat] Um…

19:59.875 --> 20:02.208
What kind of criminating question
am I supposed to ask?

20:02.291 --> 20:04.708
Should I say something like, um…

20:09.875 --> 20:10.916
what is the mark?

20:12.125 --> 20:13.583
A reasonable question.

20:14.500 --> 20:16.500
-It couldn't possibly be…
-It is.

20:17.166 --> 20:19.208
-The Ring cycle?
-[whispering] The fucking Ring cycle.

20:19.291 --> 20:20.375
-No.
-[Gwendoline] Yes.

20:20.458 --> 20:21.541
It's the Ring cycle.

20:21.625 --> 20:24.458
-Holy shit! [chuckling]
-Yes.

20:25.416 --> 20:28.583
Uh, wha… Which one?
The Rheingold? The Valkyrie?

20:29.416 --> 20:30.958
-[whispers] Yes.
-Both?

20:31.041 --> 20:32.041
[shushes]

20:32.125 --> 20:34.791
Yes. And the Siegfried.

20:35.958 --> 20:39.041
The outbreak in America, you're familiar?

20:39.125 --> 20:40.541
Yes, I heard something about it.

20:40.625 --> 20:44.041
In 96 hours, the owner of the Wagner safes
will be transferring them

20:44.125 --> 20:46.916
to a vault in Geneva
where they will be decommissioned.

20:47.708 --> 20:51.166
The puzzle that Wagner spent
his life developing will be destroyed.

20:52.791 --> 20:55.208
This is our last chance to solve it.

20:58.708 --> 21:05.208
So you're saying, in a span of four days,
we execute a series of not one,

21:05.291 --> 21:09.666
not two, but three international heists,
and we drive off into the setting sun?

21:09.750 --> 21:12.041
That is exactly what I'm saying.

21:12.125 --> 21:13.833
You realize what you're asking of me?

21:14.666 --> 21:16.000
Even if I wanted to help,

21:16.083 --> 21:18.583
the Siegfried is
a seven-turn tumbler system

21:18.666 --> 21:20.916
with over one trillion
possible combinations.

21:21.000 --> 21:25.416
Yes, trillion with the letter "T."
Trillion, yeah?

21:25.500 --> 21:28.750
Listen to me, Sebastian. Look around.

21:29.333 --> 21:30.625
The world's fucked.

21:31.625 --> 21:35.500
This window of opportunity
isn't just our only chance, it's yours.

21:36.541 --> 21:37.666
My only chance…

21:40.166 --> 21:41.291
for what?

21:41.875 --> 21:43.791
A life less ordinary.

21:46.791 --> 21:49.458
Sleep on it. You'll find me here.

21:54.791 --> 21:56.708
We could have fun together, you and I.

22:07.875 --> 22:09.291
[shouting indistinctly]

22:18.291 --> 22:20.375
[thunder rumbling]

22:20.458 --> 22:21.791
[indistinct chatter on TV]

22:26.166 --> 22:30.875
[in German] In Nevada, a virus outbreak
of unknown origin continues to spread,

22:30.958 --> 22:34.000
causing a rabies-like response
in those who contract it.

22:34.083 --> 22:38.666
This has led to the public deeming
the outbreak "the zombie apocalypse."

22:39.500 --> 22:43.041
Amidst the epidemic, groups of civilians
are stepping up to do their part

22:43.125 --> 22:45.833
in helping to rescue survivors
stuck in the infected zone.

22:45.916 --> 22:48.875
Let's check in
with one of our correspondents,

22:48.958 --> 22:51.791
Gil Pedretti, on the ground in Las Vegas.

22:51.875 --> 22:54.083
[in English] Gil, can you hear me?

22:54.166 --> 22:56.333
-[screaming]
-[zombies snarling]

22:59.500 --> 23:00.708
[screaming]

23:02.708 --> 23:04.458
[reporter, in German] Dear viewers,

23:05.125 --> 23:09.041
I can't tell you
exactly what's going on right now,

23:09.125 --> 23:12.416
-but as you just saw, this is reality.
-[hissing]

23:12.500 --> 23:16.375
-[reporter] This was really happening.
-[shouting in distance]

23:16.458 --> 23:19.458
-[dog barking]
-[reporter] As we get more information,

23:19.541 --> 23:22.916
we will certainly
give you an immediate update.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.500
[siren wailing in distance]

23:28.458 --> 23:30.750
[thudding]

23:37.791 --> 23:40.958
[bells chiming]

23:43.625 --> 23:44.500
[snarling]

23:45.625 --> 23:47.541
[tires screeching]

23:47.625 --> 23:50.208
-[car honks]
-[car crashes]

23:50.291 --> 23:52.208
[scratching at door]

23:54.375 --> 23:55.916
[playful music playing]

23:57.833 --> 23:59.583
[breath trembling]

24:15.625 --> 24:17.458
[bell chiming]

24:22.375 --> 24:23.416
[buzzing]

24:30.541 --> 24:32.208
[bells chiming]

24:54.291 --> 24:55.916
[door closes]

24:56.000 --> 24:57.166
[breath trembling]

24:59.916 --> 25:01.125
-[snarling]
-[screams]

25:02.833 --> 25:05.416
-[screams]
-[growls]

25:06.083 --> 25:10.083
[screaming]

25:10.166 --> 25:12.333
[breathing heavily]

25:23.041 --> 25:25.416
[Gwendoline] Look around.
The world's fucked.

25:26.833 --> 25:29.416
This is our perfect moment, Sebastian.

25:30.958 --> 25:31.958
Join us.

25:33.083 --> 25:34.083
[thunder rumbling]

25:36.791 --> 25:38.541
[mysterious music playing]

25:54.166 --> 25:55.041
[clears throat]

25:55.750 --> 25:56.875
Well, hi.

25:57.666 --> 25:59.125
Hi, um…

26:01.625 --> 26:04.791
I'm sorry. I did not know
the secret knock to let you know--

26:04.875 --> 26:06.333
There is no secret knock.

26:06.416 --> 26:08.833
It's just a door. You knock on it.

26:08.916 --> 26:14.666
Oh. Of course. I… I just thought
[whispers] because we're criminals now,

26:14.750 --> 26:18.125
there might be some
sort of special code that I didn't know.

26:18.208 --> 26:19.583
[whispering] No need to whisper.

26:21.333 --> 26:22.208
Just get in here.

26:24.541 --> 26:25.541
[meows]

26:26.583 --> 26:28.750
[Sebastian] Oh, wow.
That's a lot of kitties.

26:28.833 --> 26:31.000
We needed the most
inconspicuous place possible

26:31.083 --> 26:32.625
to stage our planning operations.

26:32.708 --> 26:35.416
Somewhere they wouldn't suspect,
couldn't track us.

26:35.500 --> 26:38.583
Korina found a flyer on a telephone pole
for an old lady

26:38.666 --> 26:40.791
who will pay us in cash
to cat-sit for a week.

26:41.500 --> 26:42.750
We're off-the-grid.

26:44.291 --> 26:46.666
But we're on the cat grid.

26:47.333 --> 26:48.333
[chuckles]

26:51.208 --> 26:52.041
[sniffles]

26:52.708 --> 26:55.000
Um, who's this Korina you're speaking of?

26:55.083 --> 26:58.541
Sebastian, I'd like you to meet
Korina Dominguez.

26:58.625 --> 27:02.375
She's in charge of logistics
and is a master hacker.

27:04.541 --> 27:06.708
[in Portuguese] That movie
looks fucking awesome.

27:07.208 --> 27:08.375
Would you like to see it?

27:09.333 --> 27:10.916
It's not out yet.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.458
[Gwendoline in English] When she was ten,
using only her laptop,

27:14.541 --> 27:18.333
she bypassed the security systems
for a major motion picture studio

27:18.416 --> 27:21.291
and stole an early copy
of Pirates of the Caribbean 2.

27:22.666 --> 27:26.416
Holy shit. I remember
when that was leaked. That was her?

27:26.500 --> 27:28.625
-Yes, that was me.
-[cat meows]

27:28.708 --> 27:29.958
She's done cooler things.

27:30.041 --> 27:32.625
I just figured that would
interest you the most, seeing as you're--

27:33.166 --> 27:34.375
-Well--
-Nerd.

27:35.208 --> 27:36.875
Not really a way to make friends.

27:36.958 --> 27:39.958
I meant it as a compliment
from a nerd to another nerd.

27:40.041 --> 27:41.083
[sniffles]

27:41.750 --> 27:43.333
No need to cry.

27:43.416 --> 27:45.750
My tears are because I have a cat allergy.

27:46.833 --> 27:50.333
Cat allergy. But thank you
for the compliment, Miss Dominguez.

27:51.125 --> 27:54.875
And this is our getaway driver.

27:55.500 --> 27:57.208
The best drifter you'll ever meet.

28:02.208 --> 28:05.125
-Sir, there's your ticket.
-[man] Don't park it. I'll be back in 15.

28:05.958 --> 28:07.083
Your wish is my command.

28:07.166 --> 28:08.708
[engine accelerating]

28:10.500 --> 28:11.666
[tires screeching]

28:22.541 --> 28:24.458
[laughs] Save me one of those laptops.

28:35.250 --> 28:37.416
Hey, there you go, sir.

28:38.583 --> 28:40.041
No tips? No problem.

28:41.208 --> 28:42.291
[chuckles]

28:43.333 --> 28:44.333
See ya.

28:44.416 --> 28:45.791
Getaway driver to the stars.

28:45.875 --> 28:47.875
The fastest there is.
Nobody… When I say nobody,

28:47.958 --> 28:50.500
I mean nobody knows their way
around an engine better than me.

28:50.583 --> 28:54.041
I'm gone in 50 seconds. Mr. Nicolas Cage,
eat your heart out, baby.

28:54.125 --> 28:56.375
You understand what I say
when I say what I'm saying?

28:56.458 --> 28:57.375
The name is Rolph.

28:58.375 --> 28:59.416
Pleased to meet you.

29:00.750 --> 29:01.666
Thank you, um…

29:02.708 --> 29:03.541
Your name is Rolph?

29:04.833 --> 29:07.291
Yes, my name is Rolph. What's your name?

29:08.458 --> 29:09.416
My name is Sebastian.

29:09.500 --> 29:11.708
Oh, Sebastian, yeah?

29:11.791 --> 29:13.291
-That's a shit name.
-Rolph.

29:13.375 --> 29:14.666
Who's this dickhead?

29:15.625 --> 29:16.791
[man grunting]

29:16.875 --> 29:21.041
[Gwendoline] And last but not least,
our very own real life action hero.

29:21.833 --> 29:23.583
Mr. Brad Cage.

29:27.625 --> 29:29.000
[both grunting]

29:58.833 --> 29:59.833
[Brad] Hey.

30:00.416 --> 30:04.375
I'm Brad. Leader of this,
uh, little band of misfits.

30:04.458 --> 30:07.083
Leader… Or so he fancies himself.

30:07.875 --> 30:10.458
Well, if you were me,
you'd fancy yourself too.

30:15.291 --> 30:16.500
Pleasure to meet you.

30:17.083 --> 30:18.416
Pleasure to meet you too.

30:19.583 --> 30:20.708
One word of advice.

30:21.500 --> 30:22.958
Don't fuck this up.

30:23.041 --> 30:27.041
I don't know why Gwen trusts you,
but if she trusts you, we trust you.

30:28.000 --> 30:28.916
Understand?

30:30.666 --> 30:31.750
Yes, sir.

30:31.833 --> 30:33.958
Okay. Don't fuck this up.

30:35.833 --> 30:37.500
-Now I'm nervous.
-That's good.

30:37.583 --> 30:39.583
-Yeah?
-[Brad grunts]

30:40.458 --> 30:44.916
Of course, you and I already acquainted.

30:45.500 --> 30:48.000
Sebastian, meet the team.

30:48.958 --> 30:51.208
[cats meowing]

30:56.000 --> 30:59.291
Um, what? This is the whole
international heisting crew?

30:59.875 --> 31:01.541
It's four people?

31:02.416 --> 31:03.583
Five now, isn't it?

31:04.625 --> 31:07.333
The size of our crew
is precisely why we don't get caught.

31:08.208 --> 31:10.833
Ah, so is it like in a movie film,

31:10.916 --> 31:13.250
where each one of us
has a different skill set,

31:13.333 --> 31:18.041
and it's only working together that we can
pull off that which needs the pulling off?

31:18.125 --> 31:20.875
Yes, it's exactly like that.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.708
[exhales]

31:23.791 --> 31:27.166
Everyone, meet Sebastian…
Unpronounceable last name.

31:27.250 --> 31:32.125
Safecracker extraordinaire.
Has a lifetime of theoretical expertise.

31:32.666 --> 31:35.166
But he has never applied
his skills in real life.

31:35.750 --> 31:37.458
Until now, that is.

31:41.083 --> 31:44.750
It's so nice to be meeting you
and joining the team.

31:46.500 --> 31:47.416
Whoo!

31:51.166 --> 31:53.000
[Korina] Okay, ladies and gentlemen.

31:53.083 --> 31:56.500
Over the last three years,
we've assembled from various sources

31:56.583 --> 31:58.208
the locations of the three safes,

31:58.291 --> 32:01.708
as well as more information
about their construction.

32:01.791 --> 32:03.333
[Rolph] Yeah. We already know this.

32:03.416 --> 32:06.333
Can we go play Mario Kart
while you fill in Mr. Scrawny over here?

32:06.416 --> 32:07.958
[Brad] Hey, show some respect, dude.

32:08.041 --> 32:09.958
-Lady's talking.
-All right, man.

32:10.041 --> 32:12.958
Thank you, Brad. Korina, please continue.

32:13.041 --> 32:17.000
[Korina] The Rheingold,
in a small bank in Paris, France.

32:17.083 --> 32:20.250
Four hundred thirteen
million combinations.

32:20.333 --> 32:23.833
The least complex of the three,
which means it's the least guarded.

32:23.916 --> 32:25.791
It also contains
the least amount of money.

32:25.875 --> 32:27.666
Frankly, I'm not sure why we're bothering.

32:27.750 --> 32:29.958
Because it's not just
about the money, Brad.

32:30.041 --> 32:31.791
It's about the quest.

32:31.875 --> 32:34.541
-Ah, right. Yeah, the quest.
-[Rolph] The quest, yeah.

32:34.625 --> 32:36.541
-The quest.
-[Korina] Next.

32:36.625 --> 32:40.375
The Valkyrie, in a high security bank
in Prague, Czech Republic.

32:40.458 --> 32:43.916
About 235 billion combinations.

32:44.000 --> 32:48.166
Estimated to contain
the equivalent of $40 million.

32:48.250 --> 32:50.041
That's American goddamn dollars.

32:50.125 --> 32:53.208
-We're getting in.
-[Rolph] Yeah, Brad, let's get that money.

32:53.291 --> 32:57.500
[Korina] And the Siegfried,
in a casino in St. Moritz, Switzerland.

32:57.583 --> 32:59.708
Seventy-two trillion combinations.

32:59.791 --> 33:03.625
Said to contain as much as $100 million.

33:04.791 --> 33:07.791
All of the Wagner safes
are under the ownership

33:08.333 --> 33:12.708
of infamous billionaire, Bly Tanaka.

33:12.791 --> 33:16.291
A man whose money we most certainly
do not wish to be caught stealing.

33:17.083 --> 33:18.166
Any questions?

33:18.250 --> 33:20.666
-No.
-Yes, many. Hundreds.

33:20.750 --> 33:22.875
We'll have to answer them on the way then.

33:23.625 --> 33:24.791
We've no time to waste.

33:27.083 --> 33:29.166
[thrilling music playing]

33:33.250 --> 33:34.541
[cars honking]

33:40.958 --> 33:42.458
[Brad] This is gonna be a breeze.

33:42.541 --> 33:45.083
Old Joe's looking extra old this morning.

33:45.166 --> 33:46.291
Yeah, and very lazy.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.125
And old.

33:51.958 --> 33:54.041
[spluttering] Guns. We have guns?

33:54.125 --> 33:56.625
-Yeah, only as a last resort.
-Pow!

33:57.708 --> 33:58.875
Didn't tell me we have guns.

33:58.958 --> 34:01.375
Don't worry, I don't actually
let him load it anymore.

34:01.458 --> 34:03.208
[whispers] He thinks
it makes him look cool.

34:03.291 --> 34:06.083
-What are you two whispering about?
-I'm trying to comfort the poor man,

34:06.166 --> 34:08.083
so please put the gun away.
He's in a panic.

34:08.166 --> 34:09.000
-It's away.
-Thanks.

34:09.083 --> 34:10.708
What's wrong with him?
Why's he freaking?

34:10.791 --> 34:12.958
Perhaps because we're about to do
the robbing of a bank.

34:13.958 --> 34:16.083
It's not a bank, it's a credit union.

34:16.166 --> 34:17.166
What's the difference?

34:17.250 --> 34:18.708
It's a bank for children.

34:19.791 --> 34:22.125
Why would there be a bank
specifically for kids?

34:22.208 --> 34:25.208
[Gwendoline] Okay,
she means it's child's play.

34:25.291 --> 34:28.500
Remember we said we are carrying out
the heist in order of difficulty.

34:29.083 --> 34:30.416
-Yeah, you're right.
-Okay.

34:30.500 --> 34:34.250
So they get more dangerous and more
exciting with each subsequent one. Fuck.

34:34.333 --> 34:36.375
No, it's so that if we get caught
in the next ones,

34:36.458 --> 34:39.166
we already have some money stashed away
for when we get out of the joint.

34:39.750 --> 34:41.375
What? Oh, no.

34:41.458 --> 34:44.666
Oh, God. Oh, shit.
I'm getting dizzy. [sighs]

34:44.750 --> 34:47.583
-Oh, no.
-We're good. The cameras are looping.

34:47.666 --> 34:50.166
-What if we get caught?
-We won't get caught.

34:50.250 --> 34:51.958
This one will be almost comically easy.

34:52.041 --> 34:53.500
-Comically?
-Comically.

34:53.583 --> 34:55.250
You know how sometimes in a heist movie,

34:55.333 --> 34:57.708
they show flash-forward
of how the heist should work?

34:57.791 --> 34:59.375
And it never goes according to plan,

34:59.458 --> 35:01.083
and everything gets messed up in some way.

35:01.166 --> 35:02.166
Yes, I do know this.

35:02.250 --> 35:05.291
Well, this one is actually
gonna go that smoothly.

35:06.166 --> 35:08.083
-[chuckles]
-[Sebastian sighs]

35:09.541 --> 35:10.916
Shall we go over it once more?

35:11.500 --> 35:12.541
Yes.

35:13.416 --> 35:15.500
[Brad] All right, you'll go in first.

35:16.000 --> 35:19.041
[Gwendoline] And remember,
you will no doubt be sweating profusely.

35:19.125 --> 35:21.083
-So be sure to wipe it off of your face.
-[sighs]

35:28.791 --> 35:30.041
[Brad] Once you're inside,

35:30.125 --> 35:33.208
don't look around too much.
Head straight to the bathroom.

35:33.291 --> 35:35.166
[Gwendoline] We have
scoped out the location

35:35.250 --> 35:37.041
and found people
go into the bank all the time

35:37.125 --> 35:39.875
exclusively to, uh, take shits.

35:42.416 --> 35:43.250
[Sebastian] My God.

35:43.333 --> 35:46.708
[Gwendoline] I'll follow,
lifting the keys off the security guard,

35:46.791 --> 35:48.958
which may be
the easiest part of all of this…

35:49.041 --> 35:52.375
[in French] Excuse me, sir.
Could you hold these, please?

35:52.458 --> 35:54.458
-My pleasure.
-Very kind.

35:54.541 --> 35:56.041
[in English] …as he is effectively

35:56.125 --> 35:58.208
the human equivalent
of a dummy in a cop car.

35:58.291 --> 36:01.791
[speaking French]

36:01.875 --> 36:04.333
[in French] I have an appointment
for the deposit room.

36:04.416 --> 36:06.125
-Ah, yes, please wait.
-[buzzer sounds]

36:06.916 --> 36:08.875
[Gwendoline in English] I'll ask
to see a safety deposit box…

36:08.958 --> 36:10.125
[in French] That way, please.

36:10.208 --> 36:12.875
[Gwendoline in English] …that we have
set up under a fake name.

36:20.208 --> 36:23.000
-[in French] I'll leave you to it.
-Merci.

36:32.541 --> 36:34.208
[in English] Korina will enter…

36:34.291 --> 36:37.333
[Korina] And I will ensure
that the teller leaves the hallway.

36:37.416 --> 36:39.291
[in French] You speak English?
A little bit?

36:39.916 --> 36:40.791
Non.

36:40.875 --> 36:42.750
-Non?
-Just a moment.

36:43.375 --> 36:44.375
[cell phone ringing]

36:46.250 --> 36:48.083
You speak English? A little bit?

36:49.291 --> 36:50.291
Of course.

36:50.375 --> 36:55.583
[in English] Um, how can I say, uh…
I'm in, uh, trouble?

36:55.666 --> 36:58.458
Uh, I lost all my credit cards
and my husband…

36:58.541 --> 37:00.083
[in French] So sorry. [chuckles]

37:01.166 --> 37:03.791
[Gwendoline in English]
At which point I will slip out.

37:06.583 --> 37:08.166
Then I'll pick you up…

37:10.500 --> 37:12.166
and we'll descend into the vault.

37:17.291 --> 37:18.125
[beeps]

37:21.083 --> 37:22.666
[breathing heavily]

37:26.625 --> 37:28.083
Holy mother of shit.

37:28.791 --> 37:30.083
She's beautiful.

37:39.041 --> 37:40.833
[breath trembling]

37:46.500 --> 37:47.500
Rheingold…

37:54.333 --> 37:55.333
The hell you doing?

37:56.500 --> 37:59.125
Um, I'm warming up my instruments.

37:59.750 --> 38:01.625
Oh. All right.

38:12.541 --> 38:16.375
You know the story of,
uh, Wagner's Ring cycle?

38:16.458 --> 38:17.791
Yes, I'm familiar with it.

38:17.875 --> 38:21.041
But I admit I don't know the intimate
details, which is why we have you.

38:21.125 --> 38:22.958
-Of course.
-If you could just please--

38:23.041 --> 38:27.958
Um, ironically enough, it concerns the
corrupting influence of money and power.

38:28.833 --> 38:34.375
The dwarf Alberich stole gold
from the depths of the Rhine

38:35.916 --> 38:39.541
and crafted it into a ring so powerful,

38:39.625 --> 38:42.958
all the gods under the sun
wanted it for themselves.

38:43.041 --> 38:46.250
Sort of like a more Norse
Lord of the Rings.

38:46.333 --> 38:50.083
-Hmm, yeah. Fascinating. If you could--
-As Alberich tricked the Rhine maidens

38:50.166 --> 38:51.250
for their gold,

38:51.875 --> 38:55.208
I too shall plunge your depths, my love.

38:58.500 --> 39:00.583
[sighs]

39:00.666 --> 39:02.250
[clears throat]

39:05.041 --> 39:08.416
These three locks,
I think they represent the Rhine maidens.

39:08.500 --> 39:11.833
Yes, Sebastian. But as old
as all the people upstairs are,

39:12.791 --> 39:14.791
we don't have all the time in the world.

39:16.083 --> 39:17.625
So show me why I found you.

39:19.416 --> 39:20.708
I shall begin.

39:21.666 --> 39:23.208
["Das Rheingold" playing]

39:32.291 --> 39:33.291
[blows]

39:34.250 --> 39:35.791
Could you please stop pacing?

39:36.625 --> 39:37.458
Thank you.

40:00.333 --> 40:01.541
[music stops]

40:16.833 --> 40:18.458
[gears turning]

42:13.916 --> 42:15.958
-You did it.
-I've done it.

42:16.041 --> 42:17.333
Sebastian, you did it.

42:17.416 --> 42:22.250
-I did it. I cracked a Wagner!
-[laughs]

42:22.333 --> 42:25.166
I'm invincible! [laughing]

42:25.250 --> 42:27.916
-I'm invincible!
-Okay, Mr. Invincible.

42:28.416 --> 42:30.000
Let's get on with it, shall we?

42:33.041 --> 42:34.250
There's no way it will fit.

42:34.333 --> 42:37.791
It's not about getting all of it,
it's about where we're getting it from.

42:38.291 --> 42:39.458
Don't you see?

42:40.708 --> 42:42.541
This is Everest.

42:42.625 --> 42:45.125
This is [chuckling] shooting Bigfoot.

42:45.208 --> 42:48.458
This is about becoming legends.

42:50.791 --> 42:52.000
What?

42:53.208 --> 42:58.375
Nothing, it's just all very exciting!
[chuckling] It's, uh…

42:59.500 --> 43:00.500
Focus on the 500s.

43:01.958 --> 43:05.500
[Brad] Once you've done that, I'll provide
the final part of the distraction…

43:05.583 --> 43:06.500
[phone ringing]

43:06.583 --> 43:08.000
…while Rolph waits in the van,

43:08.083 --> 43:10.458
ready at a moment's notice
to make our getaway.

43:10.541 --> 43:11.625
Bonjour, monsieur.

43:11.708 --> 43:13.791
[Gwendoline] Then I'll take you
back to the restroom.

43:15.541 --> 43:16.750
You walk out…

43:16.833 --> 43:18.333
[buzzer sounds]

43:19.708 --> 43:20.708
…and I follow.

43:22.375 --> 43:23.333
And that's that.

43:23.416 --> 43:24.833
And that's that?

43:24.916 --> 43:27.166
-[Brad] That's that.
-[Sebastian] It cannot be that easy.

43:27.250 --> 43:28.916
Sebastian, it's already done.

43:31.208 --> 43:32.541
[engine accelerating]

43:34.958 --> 43:36.958
[Sebastian laughing] We did it!

43:37.041 --> 43:40.208
[cheering]

43:40.291 --> 43:44.958
[in German] Whoo-hoo! Madness! Whoo!

43:45.041 --> 43:46.125
[in English] Fuck me.

43:47.916 --> 43:48.791
Whoo!

43:50.083 --> 43:52.291
[ominous music playing]

43:58.125 --> 43:59.041
[woman] Sir.

44:02.125 --> 44:04.000
-[sighs] Sir?
-[in French] Yes.

44:04.083 --> 44:05.958
[in English] Um,
I think I speak for all of us

44:06.041 --> 44:08.166
when I ask
why does this concern us right now?

44:11.958 --> 44:15.416
Uh, I only mean… Don't get me wrong,
but lest we forget,

44:15.500 --> 44:18.250
there's a zombie apocalypse
happening in the world right now.

44:18.333 --> 44:21.875
So why are we spending time
on this and not on…

44:21.958 --> 44:24.541
Well, you know,
matters related to the zombie--

44:24.625 --> 44:26.000
Screw the zombies.

44:27.458 --> 44:28.500
Okay?

44:28.583 --> 44:30.000
This is why.

44:30.958 --> 44:33.166
Excuse me, who's the old guy?

44:34.250 --> 44:36.375
Did nobody read
the fucking briefing packets?

44:36.875 --> 44:40.083
I'm not going to spare you
the trouble of reading your packets.

44:40.166 --> 44:41.541
For the sake of time,

44:41.625 --> 44:45.000
I will indulge you
in the abridged version of the story.

44:45.083 --> 44:47.916
This man, decades ago,

44:48.000 --> 44:52.000
built a series of four safes
that are now subject of legend.

44:52.083 --> 44:55.416
This morning,
the first of those four safes was robbed.

44:55.500 --> 44:57.916
And I think I know who did it

44:58.750 --> 45:00.208
and where they're going next.

45:01.666 --> 45:05.500
This is the last confirmed
photograph of Gwendoline Starr,

45:05.583 --> 45:07.375
before she dropped off-the-grid.

45:07.458 --> 45:10.833
And this is the last known photograph
of Alexis Broschini.

45:10.916 --> 45:15.125
Although, we have reason to believe
he now goes by the name of Brad Cage.

45:17.000 --> 45:20.958
They've pulled off five bank robberies
in the last four years.

45:21.500 --> 45:23.125
We almost had them once.

45:23.666 --> 45:26.958
Managed to catch a member of the team.
The safecracker.

45:27.625 --> 45:33.541
Would have gotten them all
if Brad fucking Cage hadn't shot me.

45:35.875 --> 45:38.375
-[man] He shot him?
-[Beatrix whispers] In the ass.

45:42.208 --> 45:43.708
And that brings us to yesterday,

45:43.791 --> 45:47.041
when this van
was captured by traffic cameras

45:47.125 --> 45:49.750
leaving the scene of the Paris heist.

45:49.833 --> 45:53.708
And the maker of the safe?
One Hans Wagner.

45:57.708 --> 45:59.833
So they must have recruited
a new safecracker.

45:59.916 --> 46:04.833
That's right. They are going for
Hans Wagner's magnum opus.

46:04.916 --> 46:07.958
And as you pointed out,
they have chosen now,

46:08.041 --> 46:10.625
when the world is completely distracted

46:10.708 --> 46:13.000
by your fucking zombie plague to do it.

46:13.708 --> 46:17.291
They don't think anyone is watching them,
but they're fucking wrong.

46:19.375 --> 46:22.625
If they're truly going for the Ring cycle,

46:24.000 --> 46:24.916
that means…

46:25.958 --> 46:30.000
that means we have two chances left
to catch them.

46:31.583 --> 46:33.000
And Goddamn it,

46:34.541 --> 46:35.625
I'm gonna do it.

46:38.875 --> 46:40.000
I'm gonna do it.

46:41.375 --> 46:43.791
Yeah, he means, uh, we are going to do it.

46:43.875 --> 46:46.458
Uh, me and him
leading the investigation together.

46:46.541 --> 46:47.708
So he's right.

46:47.791 --> 46:51.250
Uh, read your packets and I'm going to
make sure he's not having a heart attack.

46:52.583 --> 46:54.166
[upbeat music playing]

46:54.250 --> 46:55.708
[indistinct chatter]

46:58.541 --> 46:59.458
[Gwendoline] Come on.

46:59.541 --> 47:01.125
[Brad] …about two more tries.

47:04.208 --> 47:06.041
[both cheering]

47:06.125 --> 47:07.666
-Okay.
-Lucky shot.

47:07.750 --> 47:09.041
In your face.

47:10.625 --> 47:12.750
-[Brad] Easy. You ready for this?
-[Gwendoline] Yes.

47:15.250 --> 47:16.583
-[Brad] Huh?
-[Gwendoline cheering]

47:16.666 --> 47:19.583
-Yes! [exclaims]
-Whoo! That's game over.

47:19.666 --> 47:21.291
Huh, huh?

47:21.375 --> 47:23.083
Don't worry.
We'll get them next time. Go on.

47:24.333 --> 47:26.625
May I ask, are we
doing the bonding right now?

47:27.125 --> 47:28.208
Yeah, if you like.

47:28.916 --> 47:30.375
You know how I like to do my bonding?

47:30.875 --> 47:32.625
Over some sandwiches. Let's go. Come on.

47:33.666 --> 47:35.000
-[Brad] Losers.
-[Gwendoline] Whoo!

47:35.083 --> 47:37.208
-Yeah, yeah.
-[whispers] I love sandwiches.

47:37.291 --> 47:39.291
Yeah? How do you say sandwiches in German?

47:39.375 --> 47:41.041
-Sandwiches.
-Sandwiches.

47:41.125 --> 47:42.791
-How do you say salad?
-Salat.

47:42.875 --> 47:44.333
Salat.

47:45.708 --> 47:46.625
He did it.

47:47.291 --> 47:48.500
[both chuckle]

47:51.250 --> 47:52.083
Uh…

47:52.875 --> 47:54.000
[Gwendoline] He did it.

47:58.750 --> 47:59.833
Yeah, he did.

48:06.208 --> 48:07.375
[Rolph] Big day tomorrow.

48:07.458 --> 48:09.833
Protein in the meat
absorbs the alcohol in your body.

48:10.583 --> 48:13.833
You need that one plate of meat
for every five beers that you drink.

48:13.916 --> 48:17.125
But you're gonna wake up
feeling fresher than ever.

48:17.750 --> 48:19.125
My grandma taught me that.

48:19.208 --> 48:20.750
Scientifically proven.

48:22.041 --> 48:24.666
-[upbeat music playing]
-What did he just say?

48:25.541 --> 48:27.416
I don't know, I never understand him.

48:29.875 --> 48:31.083
Having fun?

48:31.166 --> 48:33.500
Yes, I'm having so much fun.

48:33.583 --> 48:37.041
This is the first real party
I've been to in many moons.

48:38.333 --> 48:39.416
I don't judge.

48:45.125 --> 48:47.333
The music is very, very cool.

48:47.416 --> 48:48.708
Who is the maker?

48:48.791 --> 48:51.458
You're looking at her.
[whispers] I only DJ my own music.

48:53.083 --> 48:54.541
Oh, wow, that's very cool.

48:56.083 --> 48:57.875
So you want to make out or whatever?

48:59.416 --> 49:00.333
Sorry?

49:00.416 --> 49:02.208
Uh… Do I wish to, uh…

49:04.791 --> 49:06.125
Oh, my God. Um…

49:06.750 --> 49:07.708
[sighs]

49:09.208 --> 49:10.500
Um…

49:15.791 --> 49:16.833
Good luck with that.

49:19.375 --> 49:20.208
[sighs]

49:23.083 --> 49:24.958
-Listen.
-[cat meows]

49:25.041 --> 49:29.666
I've worked with Gwen for quite a while
and I like her a lot.

49:30.666 --> 49:33.458
But how much did she tell you
about who she is?

49:34.166 --> 49:35.000
Not the most.

49:37.583 --> 49:40.916
Not to go crying out
somebody else's sob story, yeah.

49:41.000 --> 49:42.875
But she's had a tough go.

49:42.958 --> 49:44.333
Her parents were rich as shit.

49:44.416 --> 49:46.166
But she ditched them when she was 17,

49:46.250 --> 49:48.458
then joined a gang
of other rich shithead kids.

49:49.291 --> 49:50.708
Brad was one of those kids.

49:51.833 --> 49:54.708
-Ah, now I understand. Okay.
-Mm-hmm.

49:56.000 --> 49:57.208
Yes. Um…

49:57.916 --> 49:58.916
Okay. [sighs]

50:03.333 --> 50:04.416
[speaking indistinctly]

50:25.000 --> 50:25.916
[Gwendoline sighs]

50:30.333 --> 50:31.250
Hello.

50:33.541 --> 50:34.541
Hello.

50:35.416 --> 50:37.416
Oh. Hi.

50:37.500 --> 50:40.541
Are you all right?
I, uh… I brought you some water.

50:42.166 --> 50:45.416
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just
going over the plans for tomorrow.

50:53.000 --> 50:54.041
Fun time tonight?

50:55.250 --> 50:57.250
Yes. Uh, very much fun.

50:58.291 --> 51:02.541
I think me and Rolph
are becoming very good bros. Yeah.

51:02.625 --> 51:03.625
[chuckles]

51:03.708 --> 51:08.208
And in fact, my heart
is still racing from, you know…

51:08.291 --> 51:09.500
You know, uh…

51:10.208 --> 51:13.958
Today was incredible. [sighs]

51:18.416 --> 51:19.250
How are you?

51:23.125 --> 51:25.125
Uh, I'm… I'm all right.

51:26.041 --> 51:28.958
Well, I had a little tiff with Alexis.

51:30.291 --> 51:31.375
Who's Alexis?

51:32.583 --> 51:35.958
[chuckles] Of course.
You know him as Brad, don't you?

51:37.458 --> 51:38.500
[splutters] Wait.

51:39.166 --> 51:42.083
His real name is not Brad Cage?

51:42.166 --> 51:43.333
[chuckles]

51:43.416 --> 51:44.791
Nobody's real name is Brad Cage.

51:45.750 --> 51:47.125
[Sebastian] Why did he change it?

51:47.625 --> 51:51.625
I don't know. Alexis grew up
watching American action movies.

51:51.708 --> 51:54.083
He idolized the heroes. [scoffs]

51:54.791 --> 51:58.541
You know, he said he wanted
the most badass possible American name.

51:58.625 --> 52:03.125
Like, I quote,
"If, uh, Brad Pitt and Nic Cage

52:03.208 --> 52:05.583
fucked and had an even hotter baby."

52:06.791 --> 52:08.083
And it's…

52:08.166 --> 52:09.791
It's really how he sees himself.

52:10.583 --> 52:14.125
It's sad that he could not learn
to love the name he was born with.

52:14.208 --> 52:17.708
Yeah, but we can't
all be called Sebastian Schlencht-Wöhnert.

52:18.541 --> 52:19.625
What's wrong with my name?

52:19.708 --> 52:22.750
-[chuckles] Nothing.
-No. What's wrong with my name?

52:22.833 --> 52:26.041
Well, it's a… You know,
it's a bit of a mouthful, that's all.

52:27.250 --> 52:31.250
You've never considered
something simpler, ever?

52:35.541 --> 52:36.541
What?

52:39.166 --> 52:40.958
[Sebastian] Do you want to hear a secret?

52:42.041 --> 52:43.458
-Yes.
-Okay.

52:44.750 --> 52:45.708
[clears throat]

52:50.666 --> 52:51.583
Okay.

52:52.416 --> 52:54.416
When I was, like, a little kid…

52:54.500 --> 52:57.416
My God, this sounds so stupid. Um…

52:59.166 --> 53:01.666
You know, I never really
fit into this world.

53:01.750 --> 53:04.916
While others were doing stuff
that kids do…

53:05.000 --> 53:06.041
[in German] Silence!

53:07.375 --> 53:10.791
[in English] …I retreated
into my own world and improved my skills.

53:16.083 --> 53:17.750
[in German] I did it. Yes!

53:17.833 --> 53:19.250
I'm a master!

53:19.333 --> 53:23.250
[in English] And to document my passion,
I used to write my own comic book.

53:23.833 --> 53:27.833
It was about a master safecracker
and explorer named

53:29.375 --> 53:31.250
Ludwig Dieter.

53:32.666 --> 53:34.916
Ludwig Dieter. Yeah.

53:35.541 --> 53:39.000
I thought it was, like,
the coolest name ever.

53:39.583 --> 53:44.333
Now I realize it's pretty much
as dorky as my actual name.

53:44.416 --> 53:47.875
[chuckles] Sure, but… Ludwig Dieter.

53:49.291 --> 53:51.166
Yeah, well, it's easier to pronounce.

53:58.458 --> 54:01.583
-Um, can I ask you a question?
-Yes.

54:05.375 --> 54:06.791
Why do you do what you do?

54:10.708 --> 54:11.625
Um…

54:12.291 --> 54:13.166
[sighs]

54:14.875 --> 54:19.375
Well, you could say it runs in the family.

54:20.666 --> 54:23.666
My father was a rich asshole,

54:24.375 --> 54:27.666
one who got richer
from the collapse of the housing market.

54:28.333 --> 54:31.916
I mean, he stole from people
who had next to nothing.

54:33.458 --> 54:34.500
[Sebastian] Look at me,

54:35.000 --> 54:38.750
old Sebastian talking to the most
interesting girl in the world.

54:39.750 --> 54:41.125
Can you believe my luck?

54:41.708 --> 54:44.791
This was the greatest evening
of my life thus far.

54:46.083 --> 54:50.041
She would tell me many things that night.
A great many things.

54:50.833 --> 54:52.208
Some of them happy,

54:52.291 --> 54:54.500
some of them decidedly less so.

54:56.125 --> 54:59.166
That she never felt
that she fit in with her parents.

54:59.250 --> 55:01.250
And longed for a more exciting life

55:01.333 --> 55:03.541
than the one
they had chosen for themselves.

55:05.291 --> 55:07.375
How stealing made her feel alive.

55:08.375 --> 55:10.541
How she met Alexis when she was 19,

55:10.625 --> 55:14.125
and thought she saw kindness in him
and the rest of the crew.

55:14.208 --> 55:15.708
The kindredness of spirit.

55:16.875 --> 55:19.583
Kindredness. Is that a word?

55:19.666 --> 55:22.583
[Gwendoline] I've done
a lot of stupid shit. [chuckles]

55:23.666 --> 55:29.416
But I always felt like if I could do
just one really great thing in my life,

55:29.500 --> 55:32.041
something people would remember,

55:32.791 --> 55:35.333
whatever happened before or after,

55:36.458 --> 55:37.541
it wouldn't matter.

55:39.083 --> 55:40.541
[whispers] The Ring cycle.

55:41.666 --> 55:43.375
The Ring cycle. [chuckles]

55:44.291 --> 55:46.333
-[Brad] That little asshole.
-[Rolph] Hmm.

55:47.666 --> 55:50.291
He thinks he can spend the whole night
talking to my girlfriend?

55:50.375 --> 55:53.875
I mean, is my company
not good enough for her, huh?

55:53.958 --> 55:55.458
I'm fucking delightful.

55:56.166 --> 55:58.958
Maybe they're just starting
to form a meaningful friendship.

55:59.041 --> 56:00.958
Sebastian is a likable dude.

56:01.958 --> 56:06.458
[Gwendoline] I know we're an odd bunch,
but we've just stuck together for so long.

56:07.166 --> 56:08.541
A little family.

56:08.625 --> 56:13.958
[sighs] But I'd be lying if I said
I didn't sometimes think about

56:14.041 --> 56:15.500
striking out on my own.

56:16.541 --> 56:19.291
[clicks tongue] Okay, where…
where would you go?

56:27.583 --> 56:30.166
America. Nevada specifically.

56:30.250 --> 56:33.541
Where the zombies are? Are you crazy? Why?

56:36.416 --> 56:38.208
There's a rumor that's where it is.

56:40.333 --> 56:41.791
[Sebastian] The Götterdämmerung.

56:44.125 --> 56:45.416
[laughs]

56:46.208 --> 56:47.625
Could you imagine… [chuckles]

56:48.125 --> 56:50.041
…if we got here and cracked the safe?

56:50.125 --> 56:52.458
[continues indistinctly]

56:52.541 --> 56:54.583
[exhilarating music playing]

57:01.041 --> 57:03.250
[Rolph] Ladies and gentlemen,
if you look to your left,

57:03.333 --> 57:05.708
that's the bank
we're about to heist the shit out of.

57:05.791 --> 57:08.541
[Sebastian] Holy moly, this looks bigger
than the last one.

57:09.041 --> 57:11.750
Why would it be smaller, hmm?

57:11.833 --> 57:14.416
What were you expecting, huh?

57:15.458 --> 57:16.750
[bell chimes]

57:19.541 --> 57:21.958
-[Delacroix over radio] Anything?
-Nope, nothing.

57:22.791 --> 57:24.791
Okay, stay sharp. It has to happen today.

57:24.875 --> 57:28.166
Or they have no time to pull off the third
job before the safes are transferred.

57:28.250 --> 57:31.250
Unless they're pulling off
the third job now while we're here.

57:31.333 --> 57:33.208
No. They'll do them in sequence.

57:34.000 --> 57:35.333
Sorry. I know they will.

57:35.875 --> 57:37.833
-If you say so.
-Yes, I say so.

57:44.625 --> 57:46.458
"Junior branch coordinator."

57:46.541 --> 57:47.916
Congratulations.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.750
Prestigious position, Madam Secretary.

57:51.458 --> 57:54.458
-Why am I a secretary?
-Blame her, she made them. Move.

57:54.541 --> 57:57.083
-Sorry, Gwen.
-How's it looking, Korina?

57:57.166 --> 57:59.000
[Korina] As good as can be expected.

57:59.083 --> 58:00.708
Excuse me, a question.

58:00.791 --> 58:03.708
-This sounds less good than super great.
-Hey.

58:05.541 --> 58:07.750
All right, this isn't
a credit union anymore.

58:08.291 --> 58:09.416
This is the real deal.

58:10.750 --> 58:12.000
The real deal?

58:12.083 --> 58:14.958
They have a million extremely
complex security protocols in place

58:15.041 --> 58:17.041
to detect exactly
what we're trying to do here.

58:17.125 --> 58:20.250
-Literally a million?
-[Brad] Yeah, literally a million.

58:20.333 --> 58:23.916
I've been reconning their systems
for months to test their capabilities.

58:24.500 --> 58:26.875
Reconning? What does this mean, reconning?

58:26.958 --> 58:29.791
You know, reconning. Fucking reconning.
I've been reconning them.

58:29.875 --> 58:32.333
Now get out of my asshole,
Mr. I Don't Want To Make Out.

58:33.000 --> 58:35.208
Ah, okay. Got it. Okay, reconning.

58:35.291 --> 58:38.000
I can only be in their system
for 16 seconds at a time

58:38.083 --> 58:39.125
without them detecting me.

58:39.208 --> 58:41.833
Then I have to drop out,
do the whole thing over again,

58:41.916 --> 58:44.583
repeat until I can get your asses
into the vault, so…

58:44.666 --> 58:47.791
Um, okay, uh,
not to be all Johnny New Guy…

58:47.875 --> 58:49.291
Not an expression.

58:49.375 --> 58:52.333
But this sounds much riskier than Paris.
Are we sure it will work?

58:53.000 --> 58:54.875
It will theoretically work, yes.

58:55.708 --> 58:57.875
-Theoretically?
-[Brad] Theoretically.

58:57.958 --> 59:01.708
According to theory rather than
experience or practical application.

59:02.833 --> 59:07.833
Realistically, I give you about
a 5% chance of survival, so good luck.

59:07.916 --> 59:09.166
Not helping.

59:09.916 --> 59:11.583
It will work. We're ready.

59:12.166 --> 59:14.125
-You good, bro?
-Good, brother.

59:15.583 --> 59:17.458
Hey. Hey, talk to me.

59:18.208 --> 59:19.791
What's going on? How are you feeling?

59:21.125 --> 59:23.083
About the going to the bank?

59:23.791 --> 59:24.958
Very, very scared.

59:26.541 --> 59:28.208
About the safe breaking itself,

59:28.291 --> 59:30.916
"Hey, I feel great. I cracked a Wagner."

59:32.833 --> 59:34.250
Nothing can stop me now.

59:34.916 --> 59:36.000
[bell rings]

1:00:08.083 --> 1:00:08.916
[beeps]

1:00:09.000 --> 1:00:10.166
I'm in.

1:00:10.250 --> 1:00:11.083
[beeps]

1:00:19.083 --> 1:00:20.583
-Two seconds.
-And I'm out.

1:00:22.500 --> 1:00:23.500
Did he get through?

1:00:24.083 --> 1:00:25.583
[whispers] Holy shit, it worked.

1:00:25.666 --> 1:00:28.208
-[Korina] What were you expecting?
-[Brad] You're a fucking genius.

1:00:29.416 --> 1:00:30.500
Yes, I know.

1:00:33.125 --> 1:00:37.000
Sebastian, in front of you
are two doors. Take the left.

1:00:38.083 --> 1:00:41.083
I'm going to lead you
through a series of evasive steps, okay?

1:00:41.166 --> 1:00:43.125
-In case anyone is watching.
-[beeps]

1:00:44.416 --> 1:00:47.000
Go to the elevator at the end of the hall.

1:00:50.041 --> 1:00:50.875
Shit!

1:00:50.958 --> 1:00:53.541
-Shit?
-[Korina] Gwen's elevator is busy.

1:00:53.625 --> 1:00:55.041
I got to go, bye.

1:00:55.125 --> 1:00:57.375
[whispering] Wait. Korina, what elevator?

1:00:57.458 --> 1:00:58.708
[elevator dings]

1:01:01.500 --> 1:01:03.666
[Korina] Gwen, go up to level four.

1:01:04.250 --> 1:01:06.208
Cross the office
and I'll send the other elevator.

1:01:12.666 --> 1:01:13.916
First door on your left.

1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:16.041
[upbeat pop music playing]

1:01:20.416 --> 1:01:21.416
[in Czech] Hi.

1:01:21.958 --> 1:01:25.166
Pavel, for the last time,
you can't drink in here.

1:01:29.500 --> 1:01:32.000
-[Pavel] Did you see that?
-Where did he go?

1:01:37.958 --> 1:01:38.958
He disappears.

1:01:41.625 --> 1:01:42.541
[in English] Anything?

1:01:43.208 --> 1:01:44.416
Still negatory.

1:01:44.500 --> 1:01:47.750
Sebastian, the vault elevator
behind the locked door ahead of you.

1:01:47.833 --> 1:01:50.833
Go up, pretend to unlock it,
and I'll open it, okay?

1:01:50.916 --> 1:01:52.250
[in German] Just pretend.

1:01:54.291 --> 1:01:57.000
[in English] Pretend to unlock.

1:02:02.708 --> 1:02:04.250
-Thank you.
-[Korina] Bye.

1:02:04.958 --> 1:02:06.000
[computer trilling]

1:02:09.750 --> 1:02:10.750
Come on, let's go.

1:02:16.625 --> 1:02:17.916
[clears throat softly]

1:02:21.708 --> 1:02:22.791
[clears throat]

1:02:23.875 --> 1:02:25.041
You all right?

1:02:26.416 --> 1:02:29.291
May I ask, you didn't tell me
about you and Mr. Brad.

1:02:29.375 --> 1:02:30.666
What?

1:02:30.750 --> 1:02:33.416
The two of you are together
in the romantic sense.

1:02:33.500 --> 1:02:35.875
-[scoffs]
-I, of course, understand.

1:02:35.958 --> 1:02:38.291
-He's amongst the handsome--
-Is this really the time…

1:02:38.375 --> 1:02:41.416
I never said one way or another
whether I had a boyfriend or not,

1:02:41.500 --> 1:02:43.750
and frankly,
I don't know what it is to you.

1:02:44.666 --> 1:02:46.708
I only ask why did you hide this from me?

1:02:46.791 --> 1:02:49.125
-[scoffs] Okay.
-I was--

1:02:50.375 --> 1:02:51.208
Hold this, please.

1:02:51.291 --> 1:02:53.083
[guard in Czech] Show me your ID.

1:02:53.166 --> 1:02:54.041
[grunting]

1:02:54.125 --> 1:02:54.958
[gasps]

1:02:56.208 --> 1:02:57.291
[in English] Oh, fuck.

1:03:13.208 --> 1:03:14.333
[both grunting]

1:03:19.500 --> 1:03:20.916
Gwen! Gwen!

1:03:49.541 --> 1:03:51.875
[squealing]

1:03:52.416 --> 1:03:53.583
Uh…

1:03:54.333 --> 1:03:56.541
-What the fuck was that?
-What?

1:03:56.625 --> 1:03:57.791
[guards groaning]

1:03:57.875 --> 1:03:59.333
You karate'd two men.

1:04:00.083 --> 1:04:02.333
You did not say that was part of the plan.

1:04:03.166 --> 1:04:04.583
It wasn't. I improvised.

1:04:07.208 --> 1:04:08.583
Always be prepared.

1:04:09.083 --> 1:04:10.291
[breathing heavily]

1:04:10.375 --> 1:04:11.291
Always be prepared.

1:04:11.375 --> 1:04:12.625
[muffled grunting]

1:04:25.458 --> 1:04:29.416
Did you know that Richard Wagner
spent 31 years writing the Ring cycle?

1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:32.916
Much longer than even Hans spent
building the corresponding safes.

1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:34.291
["Ride of the Valkyries" playing]

1:04:34.375 --> 1:04:36.375
Yes, actually, I did know that.

1:04:37.958 --> 1:04:41.791
Wagner's work had many themes
of great importance to him,

1:04:42.833 --> 1:04:45.750
but all of them touched upon love.

1:04:47.875 --> 1:04:51.250
For instance, the story of the safe
that has brought us here today.

1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:53.375
The Valkyrie.

1:04:54.458 --> 1:04:58.708
The first act of the story
takes place on Earth

1:04:58.791 --> 1:05:01.291
as the children of Odin or Wotan,

1:05:01.375 --> 1:05:04.791
the siblings, Siegmund and Sieglinde
happen to cross one another

1:05:05.583 --> 1:05:06.791
and fall in love.

1:05:07.750 --> 1:05:08.875
Gross.

1:05:08.958 --> 1:05:09.916
No, it's okay.

1:05:10.458 --> 1:05:13.416
They did not know at the time
they were brother and sister.

1:05:14.208 --> 1:05:18.291
The second act of the story
takes place far above Earth,

1:05:18.375 --> 1:05:21.583
in a kingdom meant to represent Valhalla.

1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:25.250
It's the gods' plan, a course of action,

1:05:25.333 --> 1:05:28.625
and Wotan sends his daughter Brünnhilde
to kill Siegmund.

1:05:28.708 --> 1:05:30.791
But moved by his love for Sieglinde,

1:05:31.375 --> 1:05:33.500
she does not and helps her instead.

1:05:35.041 --> 1:05:39.250
This angers Odin,
who decrees the most dire of punishment,

1:05:39.750 --> 1:05:42.416
stripping Brünnhilde of her immortality

1:05:43.041 --> 1:05:44.833
and casting her out of her Valhalla.

1:05:46.958 --> 1:05:50.000
I believe the locks are to be solved
in the order of the story

1:05:50.083 --> 1:05:51.791
and then the cycle begins anew.

1:05:52.583 --> 1:05:56.291
The themes of these stories
were the model, still relevant,

1:05:57.916 --> 1:06:02.208
such as deception
and double cross in love.

1:06:04.250 --> 1:06:05.083
[scoffs]

1:06:07.625 --> 1:06:08.666
[Gwendoline] Great. Yeah.

1:06:08.750 --> 1:06:11.041
Let's get on with it now, shall we?

1:06:11.916 --> 1:06:12.750
Yes.

1:06:13.333 --> 1:06:14.375
Oh.

1:06:14.458 --> 1:06:15.625
Really?

1:06:15.708 --> 1:06:17.666
["Ride of the Valkyries"
continues playing]

1:06:18.500 --> 1:06:20.958
Why… Oh, okay.

1:06:23.291 --> 1:06:25.541
-[Delacroix] Anything?
-[man on radio] Still negatory.

1:06:27.958 --> 1:06:29.333
[groans]

1:06:29.416 --> 1:06:32.375
-[in French] Something's not right here.
-Yes, I'm inclined to agree.

1:06:32.458 --> 1:06:36.208
I'm not missing our shot.
If they're inside…

1:06:37.833 --> 1:06:40.083
We're going to catch them.

1:06:40.166 --> 1:06:41.291
[in English] Let's go.

1:06:41.375 --> 1:06:42.291
We're moving in.

1:06:42.375 --> 1:06:44.375
[dramatic music playing]

1:06:50.125 --> 1:06:52.166
[guard in Czech] Got him. Camera 52.

1:06:54.875 --> 1:06:55.833
What the fuck.

1:06:56.458 --> 1:06:58.291
Someone's in our system.

1:06:59.583 --> 1:07:01.041
[alarm beeping]

1:07:01.125 --> 1:07:03.083
-[in English] Oh, fuck.
-What is it?

1:07:03.166 --> 1:07:06.791
They triggered their silent alert. Locks
the elevators until they investigate.

1:07:06.875 --> 1:07:08.541
So, what? They're onto us?

1:07:08.625 --> 1:07:10.500
They're on the path to being onto us.

1:07:10.583 --> 1:07:11.541
Shit.

1:07:11.625 --> 1:07:13.416
All right, time for plan B.

1:07:14.291 --> 1:07:16.833
-Plan B now?
-Yes. Plan B, Rolph.

1:07:16.916 --> 1:07:17.958
Yo, come on, man.

1:07:18.583 --> 1:07:19.541
Mr. Delacroix,

1:07:20.208 --> 1:07:22.541
there is really something
that you should know.

1:07:22.625 --> 1:07:23.625
[Delacroix] Open the gate.

1:07:26.541 --> 1:07:27.416
[door buzzes]

1:07:28.625 --> 1:07:29.541
[Korina] You ready?

1:07:30.333 --> 1:07:32.166
-[Brad] Yeah.
-Okay. Go.

1:07:44.458 --> 1:07:45.708
What the fuck?

1:07:45.791 --> 1:07:47.125
-[horn honking]
-[tires screech]

1:07:51.750 --> 1:07:52.833
This is not a Wagner.

1:07:53.875 --> 1:07:55.333
We're in the wrong bank.

1:08:08.208 --> 1:08:09.291
[people screaming]

1:08:24.250 --> 1:08:26.416
[Delacroix] You traded your safe.

1:08:28.958 --> 1:08:29.791
Yes.

1:08:29.875 --> 1:08:31.041
What the fuck?

1:08:31.125 --> 1:08:32.333
Listen. Listen.

1:08:33.125 --> 1:08:34.458
Given its impenetrable nature,

1:08:34.541 --> 1:08:36.458
they decided
its purpose would be better served

1:08:36.541 --> 1:08:39.666
at one of our more prestigious locations.

1:08:39.750 --> 1:08:42.166
Where? Where did you send it?

1:08:43.750 --> 1:08:46.416
-[people screaming]
-[Brad] Everyone get on the ground!

1:08:47.791 --> 1:08:49.625
You, pass me that bag!

1:08:49.708 --> 1:08:52.458
Move, move, move.

1:08:53.958 --> 1:08:55.291
Thank you very much.

1:08:55.375 --> 1:08:56.416
What was that?

1:08:56.500 --> 1:08:58.208
Oh, uh, don't worry about it.

1:08:58.291 --> 1:09:01.083
It's just a little distraction
to buy some more time.

1:09:01.166 --> 1:09:02.166
I'm sure.

1:09:03.041 --> 1:09:04.583
But we should hurry it up.

1:09:05.333 --> 1:09:06.333
[softly] Okay.

1:09:11.166 --> 1:09:12.291
All right.

1:09:12.375 --> 1:09:13.958
[breathes deeply]

1:09:14.041 --> 1:09:15.583
You'll see. This will be easy.

1:09:16.125 --> 1:09:17.000
[chuckles softly]

1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:21.000
[clicking]

1:09:41.416 --> 1:09:42.416
[speaking German]

1:09:43.291 --> 1:09:44.500
[Gwendoline] What's going on?

1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:46.833
-It just--
-It just what?

1:09:47.625 --> 1:09:49.791
It just detected my presence.

1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:54.083
[heart beating]

1:09:54.791 --> 1:09:56.791
Okay. What do we have here?

1:09:59.375 --> 1:10:02.375
Tell me. What do you want me to do?

1:10:08.791 --> 1:10:09.625
[exhales]

1:10:14.416 --> 1:10:16.041
Nothing to worry about.

1:10:16.125 --> 1:10:18.666
Uh… [chuckles] Okay, what does that mean?

1:10:19.458 --> 1:10:22.541
That if I fuck up again, it locks forever.

1:10:22.625 --> 1:10:23.500
That's all.

1:10:24.083 --> 1:10:26.041
That kind of sounds
like something to worry about,

1:10:26.125 --> 1:10:27.416
Mr. Warming Up My Instruments.

1:10:27.500 --> 1:10:30.583
-You just said this would be easy.
-I realize what I just said, okay?

1:10:30.666 --> 1:10:33.416
This fit's slightly more complicated
than I've expected.

1:10:33.500 --> 1:10:36.083
I don't understand
why you are so stressed.

1:10:36.166 --> 1:10:37.041
I'm not stressed.

1:10:37.125 --> 1:10:39.041
-You're stressed.
-You're stressed!

1:10:39.125 --> 1:10:40.708
Do you know what? Do your job.

1:10:40.791 --> 1:10:42.291
-Stop, stop, stop!
-[tires screech]

1:10:42.375 --> 1:10:43.916
Get out of the car. Get out of the car!

1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:45.125
[in French] Okay! Let's go!

1:10:45.625 --> 1:10:46.583
[in English] Come on!

1:10:49.833 --> 1:10:50.916
[in French] What? Shit!

1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:52.375
[Beatrix] What the fuck was that?

1:10:52.916 --> 1:10:54.833
[in English] Come on, move.
How are we getting on?

1:10:55.375 --> 1:10:58.333
All of you,
get in the middle of this floor.

1:10:58.416 --> 1:10:59.708
Let's move. Let's move.

1:10:59.791 --> 1:11:01.375
-Let's move!
-[gunshot]

1:11:33.208 --> 1:11:34.083
[mouthing] Come on.

1:11:59.541 --> 1:12:01.291
Let's go. Come on.

1:12:01.958 --> 1:12:04.708
Let's move! Let's move!

1:12:09.416 --> 1:12:10.541
[in Czech] Damn it.

1:12:11.791 --> 1:12:13.541
[alarm blaring]

1:12:13.625 --> 1:12:14.708
[in English] Shit.

1:12:14.791 --> 1:12:16.208
They triggered the alarm.

1:12:18.250 --> 1:12:19.208
[Brad] Hello?

1:12:19.708 --> 1:12:21.500
Fill the bag. Come on!

1:12:21.583 --> 1:12:23.916
Faster. Faster. Faster.

Shit.

1:13:01.291 --> 1:13:02.500
[Gwendoline] What?

1:13:02.583 --> 1:13:03.583
What is it?

1:13:10.541 --> 1:13:12.625
Is this a good freeze or a bad freeze?

1:13:46.750 --> 1:13:47.750
[gasps]

1:13:49.291 --> 1:13:50.375
-[exclaims]

1:13:50.458 --> 1:13:51.750
Oh, my God!

1:13:52.708 --> 1:13:53.791
You did it! You did it!

1:13:53.875 --> 1:13:55.208
-I did it!
-You did it!

1:13:55.291 --> 1:13:56.916
[hesitates]

1:13:57.000 --> 1:13:59.333
Oh, you strange, beautiful strange man!

1:13:59.416 --> 1:14:00.750
[both laughing]

1:14:01.583 --> 1:14:02.958
Strange twice. I'll take it.

1:14:16.083 --> 1:14:17.541
[Korina] Guys, status?

1:14:19.166 --> 1:14:20.625
We got it. We're on our way out.

1:14:21.375 --> 1:14:24.208
-[Korina] Brad, get out. We got it.
-[Brad] All right. Let's zip the bag.

1:14:25.125 --> 1:14:26.166
Zip it!

1:14:27.250 --> 1:14:28.875
[Korina] Okay, Rolph, let's go.

1:14:38.333 --> 1:14:39.375
[in Czech] Freeze!

1:14:39.916 --> 1:14:40.875
Hands up!

1:14:40.958 --> 1:14:42.000
[breathing heavily]

1:14:42.083 --> 1:14:43.125
Slowly.

1:14:49.875 --> 1:14:52.041
Where are you?

1:15:50.291 --> 1:15:51.291
[groans]

1:15:51.375 --> 1:15:52.250
What happened?

1:15:52.333 --> 1:15:53.875
-You good?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

1:15:53.958 --> 1:15:55.291
[Korina] He's shot in the shoulder.

[people screaming]

1:15:56.500 --> 1:15:58.333
-[Gwendoline] This way.
-[Brad] Slow down, Rolph.

1:15:58.416 --> 1:15:59.333
Gwen's coming.

1:16:03.958 --> 1:16:05.750
Come on! Run!

1:16:07.750 --> 1:16:09.166
-Come on!
-Come on!

1:16:09.250 --> 1:16:10.208
Move!

1:16:11.791 --> 1:16:13.791
-Come on. Run!
-The bags.

1:16:15.916 --> 1:16:16.916
[Brad] Gwen, grab my hand.

1:16:17.000 --> 1:16:18.083
Go, go, go!

1:16:18.166 --> 1:16:20.333
Grab my fucking hand, now!

1:16:50.541 --> 1:16:52.541
[Brad] Move, Rolph. Drive.

1:16:59.208 --> 1:17:00.500
[in German] Fucking asshole.

1:17:00.583 --> 1:17:01.958
[sirens wailing]

1:17:05.500 --> 1:17:06.666
[horn honking]

1:17:29.625 --> 1:17:30.500
[Sebastian grunting]

1:17:30.583 --> 1:17:31.875
[in English] What are you doing?

1:17:32.625 --> 1:17:33.666
[in Czech] Stop!

1:17:34.375 --> 1:17:35.250
Police!

1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:38.166
[panting]

1:17:42.375 --> 1:17:43.708
[in German] I need the bicycle!

1:17:44.291 --> 1:17:46.250
-[in English] Sorry.
-[in Czech] That's my bike!

1:17:46.333 --> 1:17:49.083
-[in English] I'm sorry.
-[in Czech] Fuck you, asshole!

1:17:53.125 --> 1:17:54.000
[in German] Shit.

1:17:57.166 --> 1:17:58.208
Whoa, whoa.

1:17:58.291 --> 1:17:59.583
[tires screeching]

1:18:14.666 --> 1:18:15.708
[in Czech] Going to Old Town.

1:18:19.333 --> 1:18:20.375
[in German] Make way!

1:18:21.208 --> 1:18:22.083
I'm sorry.

1:18:26.333 --> 1:18:27.333
[siren chirps]

1:18:31.625 --> 1:18:32.541
Watch out!

1:18:40.541 --> 1:18:41.500
[in Czech] We lost him.

1:18:41.583 --> 1:18:42.625
Out of the way!

1:18:42.708 --> 1:18:43.833
[in English] Make way!

1:18:46.208 --> 1:18:47.708
Excuse me. [mutters]

1:18:49.083 --> 1:18:50.000
[screams]

1:18:50.625 --> 1:18:52.083
[screams hysterically]

1:18:53.125 --> 1:18:54.458
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!

1:19:01.375 --> 1:19:03.083
[officer in Czech] Stop!

1:19:04.250 --> 1:19:05.208
[grunts]

1:19:07.000 --> 1:19:07.958
Stop!

1:19:08.041 --> 1:19:09.458
[helicopter hovering]

1:19:10.916 --> 1:19:12.291
[in English] I'm so sorry.

1:19:14.458 --> 1:19:15.375
[officer in Czech] Stop!

1:19:19.500 --> 1:19:22.083
[in English] Make way! Make way!

1:19:23.541 --> 1:19:24.541
[officers shouting indistinctly]

1:19:33.208 --> 1:19:34.375
Shit.

1:19:35.416 --> 1:19:36.750
-Sir.
-What? Oh, yeah. Fuck.

1:19:37.625 --> 1:19:39.833
Interpol. Anyone hurt?

1:19:39.916 --> 1:19:42.500
Uh, no one. They used tranquilizer darts.

1:19:42.583 --> 1:19:44.708
Looks like they wiped
the cameras on the way out.

1:19:45.500 --> 1:19:49.291
It's pretty cool actually.
Almost feels like we're in a spy movie.

1:19:49.375 --> 1:19:52.416
Oh, cool. "Like a spy movie.
It's so cool, man."

1:19:52.500 --> 1:19:53.708
Shut up!

1:19:54.541 --> 1:19:55.791
Shut the fuck up.

1:19:58.083 --> 1:19:59.291
I need space to think.

1:20:04.000 --> 1:20:05.458
Fuck!

1:20:50.125 --> 1:20:51.125
[groans]

1:21:03.541 --> 1:21:05.125
[in German] Crazy! How did I do that?

1:21:06.291 --> 1:21:07.458
[laughing]

1:21:39.416 --> 1:21:40.833
[Brad groans]

1:21:45.125 --> 1:21:47.166
-[Brad] Korina?
-[Korina] Nothing.

1:21:47.250 --> 1:21:49.833
If they caught Sebastian,
they haven't announced it yet.

1:21:49.916 --> 1:21:50.833
[Brad sighs]

1:21:51.666 --> 1:21:54.250
All right, so be it. We ditch the van,

1:21:54.333 --> 1:21:57.125
trade it for something less conspicuous
and get the hell out of here.

1:21:57.208 --> 1:21:58.041
All right?

1:21:59.208 --> 1:22:00.041
Good?

1:22:03.166 --> 1:22:04.000
Gwen.

1:22:04.541 --> 1:22:05.541
Gwen?

1:22:06.125 --> 1:22:07.666
Fuck. What is wrong with you?

1:22:09.333 --> 1:22:12.208
Are you upset about
the scrawny safecracker?

1:22:12.291 --> 1:22:14.250
Don't pretend that
you didn't know the plan.

1:22:14.333 --> 1:22:16.041
That wasn't the plan.

1:22:16.625 --> 1:22:18.791
The plan was to finish the job
before we cut him loose,

1:22:18.875 --> 1:22:22.416
not throw him into the street
like a sacrificial lamb!

1:22:23.208 --> 1:22:25.458
Just for the record,
I was startin' to like the little man.

1:22:25.541 --> 1:22:29.708
-But business is business, so--
-Shut the fuck up, Rolph, and drive.

1:22:33.625 --> 1:22:36.625
We were always gonna have
to lose him eventually, all right?

1:22:36.708 --> 1:22:39.083
They almost had us.
Somebody had to go down.

1:22:39.166 --> 1:22:40.333
We could've all made it.

1:22:40.416 --> 1:22:42.125
He's not one of us. He never was.

1:22:42.208 --> 1:22:44.833
How are we gonna do
the Siegfried without him?

1:22:44.916 --> 1:22:46.666
Who gives a shit about the Siegfried?

1:22:46.750 --> 1:22:49.416
We got cleared. That is all that matters.

1:22:50.125 --> 1:22:54.291
Do you know how fucking rich
we are right now, huh?

1:22:54.375 --> 1:22:55.541
[Brad chuckles]

1:22:56.500 --> 1:22:58.541
Fuck you, Alexis.

1:23:01.500 --> 1:23:02.875
[Brad] What did you just call me?

1:23:02.958 --> 1:23:04.208
You heard me.

1:23:07.625 --> 1:23:09.000
[Rolph whispers] Korina.

1:23:10.000 --> 1:23:10.958
Who's Alexis?

1:23:12.583 --> 1:23:14.583
-Stop the van.
-[Rolph] Huh?

1:23:14.666 --> 1:23:16.208
I said, stop the van! I'm getting out.

1:23:16.291 --> 1:23:17.833
Don't stop this van, Rolph!

1:23:17.916 --> 1:23:20.041
Do not stop. Nobody's getting out.

1:23:20.125 --> 1:23:21.500
Shit.

1:23:23.958 --> 1:23:25.291
-Hey. [yells]
-[screams]

1:23:34.166 --> 1:23:35.125
I love you.

1:23:36.125 --> 1:23:37.166
[sniffles]

1:23:39.916 --> 1:23:41.333
I don't give a shit.

1:23:42.875 --> 1:23:43.833
I'm done.

1:23:44.708 --> 1:23:45.583
I'm done!

1:23:48.708 --> 1:23:51.375
Oh, you're done? You're done?

1:23:51.458 --> 1:23:53.041
-Goodbye, Alexis.
-What?

1:23:53.125 --> 1:23:54.208
Oh, fuck this shit.

1:23:55.208 --> 1:23:57.208
-Rolph, drive the car.
-[Gwendoline] Get off me!

1:23:57.708 --> 1:23:59.541
Get your hands off me.

1:23:59.625 --> 1:24:00.791
You wanna go?

1:24:00.875 --> 1:24:02.541
You wanna go, then go.

1:24:02.625 --> 1:24:03.791
[grunts]

1:24:08.083 --> 1:24:09.166
Fine!

1:24:11.875 --> 1:24:13.208
[tires screech]

1:24:13.291 --> 1:24:14.833
[indistinct shouting]

1:24:14.916 --> 1:24:16.000
[Brad] Where are you goin'?

1:24:18.041 --> 1:24:19.666
-I'm talkin' to you.
-Jesus.

1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:22.333
I'm coming too.

1:24:23.208 --> 1:24:24.041
Why?

1:24:26.208 --> 1:24:27.208
Honestly?

1:24:29.041 --> 1:24:32.000
[sighs] I put a lot of work
into planning the third heist,

1:24:32.083 --> 1:24:33.708
and Alexis is an asshole.

1:24:34.375 --> 1:24:37.166
-So let's be legends.
-[Brad] Come on.

1:24:37.250 --> 1:24:39.041
-[speaking Portuguese]
-[Brad] Yeah? Good luck.

1:24:40.041 --> 1:24:42.000
You too! Rolph, drive!

1:24:42.083 --> 1:24:43.500
So what do we do now?

1:24:44.708 --> 1:24:45.666
[sighs]

1:24:52.166 --> 1:24:55.166
Probably should've waited
till we were near a town, huh?

1:24:55.250 --> 1:24:56.375
Yeah, probably.

1:24:58.708 --> 1:24:59.791
Let's go.

1:24:59.875 --> 1:25:00.708
Come on.

1:26:12.625 --> 1:26:13.875
[water running]

1:26:16.958 --> 1:26:17.958
[machine whirring]

1:26:18.041 --> 1:26:19.041
Do we say something?

1:26:20.791 --> 1:26:21.791
No.

1:26:22.708 --> 1:26:24.916
Too much time has gone by. It's weird now.

1:26:25.666 --> 1:26:28.500
Should we just leave and then knock?

1:26:29.208 --> 1:26:32.833
Or how about when he comes back in,
we yell "surprise"?

1:26:34.833 --> 1:26:38.208
That seems like a terrible, terrible idea.

1:26:38.291 --> 1:26:40.000
-Surprise!
-Surprise!

1:26:40.083 --> 1:26:41.791
[gasps, groans]

1:26:43.083 --> 1:26:45.458
[screaming]

1:26:45.541 --> 1:26:47.916
[in German] Shit, shit, shit!

1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:50.041
[in English] All the hairs on my chest
burned off.

1:26:50.625 --> 1:26:52.750
You sure they were there to begin with?

1:26:53.708 --> 1:26:55.958
They're blonde, so you cannot see them,

1:26:56.041 --> 1:26:57.958
but they were there
and they were glorious.

1:26:58.583 --> 1:26:59.500
[Sebastian sighs]

1:27:02.208 --> 1:27:04.208
What the fuck are you guys doing here?

1:27:07.458 --> 1:27:08.375
Look…

1:27:09.625 --> 1:27:10.500
I'm sorry.

1:27:12.791 --> 1:27:13.625
That's it?

1:27:17.666 --> 1:27:20.666
I'm so sorry, Sebastian.

1:27:22.458 --> 1:27:25.166
It wasn't about the myth
of the quest for Brad and Rolph.

1:27:25.250 --> 1:27:26.625
Not like it is for us.

1:27:28.250 --> 1:27:30.916
For them, it was about finding a mark
and making a buck.

1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:32.250
Right, Gwen?

1:27:32.333 --> 1:27:34.750
I can't forgive myself
for being a part of it.

1:27:34.833 --> 1:27:36.500
And I wouldn't expect you to either.

1:27:38.458 --> 1:27:40.125
Well, thank you,

1:27:41.583 --> 1:27:42.875
but who gives a shit, right?

1:27:43.625 --> 1:27:45.458
Whether I forgive you
for almost getting me sent to prison

1:27:45.541 --> 1:27:47.625
or whether I don't, you're going to leave.

1:27:47.708 --> 1:27:52.125
I'm going to go back to my stupid job,
and that's that, right?

1:27:54.166 --> 1:27:55.333
Thank you for coming here,

1:27:56.250 --> 1:27:58.458
but I must ask you now to leave.

1:27:58.541 --> 1:28:00.625
-Sebastian, no.
-It's not over!

1:28:01.250 --> 1:28:03.541
How is it not over? Huh?

1:28:03.625 --> 1:28:06.375
Unless you've cracked the Siegfried
and didn't tell us about it,

1:28:06.458 --> 1:28:08.500
-it's not over.
-[whispers] It's not over.

1:28:11.416 --> 1:28:14.625
No, I have not yet cracked the Siegfried.

1:28:16.583 --> 1:28:18.375
I do not even know if I can.

1:28:18.458 --> 1:28:19.333
Of course you can.

1:28:19.416 --> 1:28:21.458
Did you see what happened
with the Valkyrie? I fucked up!

1:28:21.541 --> 1:28:23.083
[Gwendoline] And then you succeeded.

1:28:23.916 --> 1:28:26.041
There is more adventure waiting for us.

1:28:26.666 --> 1:28:29.750
If you think having those two assholes
fuck us over means we are done,

1:28:29.833 --> 1:28:31.708
you are sorely mistaken.

1:28:32.666 --> 1:28:34.166
We could still do it.

1:28:34.750 --> 1:28:38.208
And not just the Siegfried.
We could earn our place in history.

1:28:40.250 --> 1:28:44.125
We could go together,
the three of us, a team,

1:28:44.791 --> 1:28:47.166
to search for the Götterdämmerung.

1:28:49.875 --> 1:28:51.500
But we can't do it without you.

1:28:53.458 --> 1:28:55.458
You may not believe in yourself anymore,

1:28:56.500 --> 1:28:57.708
but I believe in you.

1:29:27.875 --> 1:29:30.208
-So you're saying--
-We need you.

1:29:32.041 --> 1:29:37.875
You need me that the three of us alone
can rob a Bly casino?

1:29:37.958 --> 1:29:38.958
That's right.

1:29:41.208 --> 1:29:43.666
-[gulps] Gulp.
-Did he just say "gulp"?

1:29:44.250 --> 1:29:45.416
[Sebastian] Yes, and I did it.

1:29:45.500 --> 1:29:47.250
What's with you, Korina? Hmm?

1:29:47.333 --> 1:29:48.625
You feel the same way?

1:29:50.166 --> 1:29:52.333
That you need me?

1:29:55.125 --> 1:29:57.583
You know, I mean, look, statistically,

1:29:57.666 --> 1:30:00.041
it's very difficult
to heist a casino, so I--

1:30:03.791 --> 1:30:05.916
Yes, I need you, Sebastian.

1:30:07.500 --> 1:30:08.875
All right, fine.

1:30:09.541 --> 1:30:13.250
I'm not saying that I trust you
because very much, no…

1:30:13.333 --> 1:30:14.416
I get it.

1:30:14.500 --> 1:30:17.416
-And it's not about the money either.
-[Gwendoline] I know.

1:30:17.500 --> 1:30:21.000
I just really want to get my fucking hands
on that fucking safe.

1:30:23.208 --> 1:30:26.250
Okay, so, what's the plan, ladies?

1:30:27.125 --> 1:30:28.291
[Delacroix sighs]

1:30:43.333 --> 1:30:44.958
[sighs] No.

1:30:45.041 --> 1:30:46.791
[murmurs indistinctly]

1:30:50.166 --> 1:30:53.791
[in German] Hello, my dear friends.
It's me again, your great safecracker.

1:30:53.875 --> 1:30:56.000
I hope you don't mind,
but the video today…

1:30:56.083 --> 1:30:57.541
[in French] I know him.

1:30:58.958 --> 1:31:00.500
I know this guy.

1:31:05.500 --> 1:31:07.291
Oh, fuck! This is the same guy.

1:31:08.083 --> 1:31:10.833
Beatrix! Beatrix!

1:31:10.916 --> 1:31:12.166
[hesitates]

1:31:12.708 --> 1:31:14.625
Damn it!

1:31:16.250 --> 1:31:17.708
Come to my office, please.

1:31:17.791 --> 1:31:18.916
Yes. Now.

1:31:22.416 --> 1:31:23.958
I found you.

1:31:28.083 --> 1:31:29.333
-[knocking at door]
-Yes.

1:31:29.416 --> 1:31:30.250
[door opens]

1:31:31.250 --> 1:31:34.083
So I hope this is super important news
because I--

1:31:34.166 --> 1:31:35.000
That's him.

1:31:36.458 --> 1:31:39.416
The guy who opens safes,
the safecracker, that's him.

1:31:40.000 --> 1:31:44.000
This guy's been living alone in Germany
making shitty YouTube videos.

1:31:44.083 --> 1:31:46.083
He's not a criminal.

1:31:47.000 --> 1:31:47.958
He's an outsider.

1:31:48.625 --> 1:31:50.916
And how does he know them?

1:31:51.000 --> 1:31:52.416
They found him like this,

1:31:54.041 --> 1:31:54.916
through YouTube.

1:31:55.458 --> 1:31:56.708
-Okay.
-Yeah.

1:31:57.500 --> 1:31:59.083
Maybe he's a patsy.

1:31:59.166 --> 1:32:01.208
Look at the poor guy.
They dumped him on the road.

1:32:01.291 --> 1:32:03.375
He's scared shitless like Bambi.

1:32:05.458 --> 1:32:08.541
I almost feel bad for him.

1:32:11.041 --> 1:32:12.208
And that's all?

1:32:15.750 --> 1:32:17.041
-Huh?
-Hmm?

1:32:17.125 --> 1:32:18.958
-What? Yes, that's all.
-That's all?

1:32:19.041 --> 1:32:19.875
Yes, that's all.

1:32:19.958 --> 1:32:20.833
Okay.

1:32:20.916 --> 1:32:22.458
Super important information.

1:32:22.541 --> 1:32:24.458
You could have told me over the phone.

1:32:27.875 --> 1:32:29.958
[in German] Nice to meet you, Sebastian.

1:32:34.125 --> 1:32:36.083
[groaning]

1:32:41.250 --> 1:32:43.250
[fast-paced music playing]

1:32:59.333 --> 1:33:00.166
[zombie growls]

1:33:02.250 --> 1:33:04.666
[in English] Hey, it's okay, it's just me.

1:33:09.000 --> 1:33:10.333
[roars]

1:33:11.458 --> 1:33:14.416
[panting] I dreamt of them again.

1:33:15.875 --> 1:33:16.708
Of zombies.

1:33:17.375 --> 1:33:19.833
[Korina] Maybe they're prophecies,
not dreams.

1:33:19.916 --> 1:33:21.541
Maybe you saw your own death.

1:33:24.000 --> 1:33:25.166
What's that now?

1:33:25.250 --> 1:33:27.833
Or maybe simply
your psyche's manifestations

1:33:27.916 --> 1:33:31.375
of your own self-doubt
and feelings of inadequacy.

1:33:31.958 --> 1:33:36.166
You know, you should be that big,
tough man. Be able to fight them.

1:33:37.500 --> 1:33:39.833
And yet again and again,

1:33:40.958 --> 1:33:42.375
they just destroy you.

1:33:43.875 --> 1:33:45.750
Or maybe you just had
a nightmare about zombies

1:33:45.833 --> 1:33:47.333
because zombies are scary.

1:33:47.416 --> 1:33:49.250
But they're just dreams, Sebastian.

1:33:52.916 --> 1:33:54.041
Or prophecies.

1:33:55.916 --> 1:33:57.541
[in a raspy voice] Zombies…

1:33:58.208 --> 1:34:00.166
[imitates growling]

1:34:09.583 --> 1:34:10.458
[Delacroix] Southside?

1:34:11.541 --> 1:34:13.375
-Nothing.
-[Delacroix] Southwest corner?

1:34:13.458 --> 1:34:14.291
No sign.

1:34:16.041 --> 1:34:17.166
[Delacroix] Northwest corner.

1:34:18.291 --> 1:34:19.166
[man] Clear.

1:34:19.250 --> 1:34:21.125
Okay, report back every two minutes.

1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:24.000
[radio chatter]

1:34:26.958 --> 1:34:29.833
T-minus eight hours
until the safe is moved.

1:34:31.500 --> 1:34:32.541
What?

1:34:33.125 --> 1:34:34.791
Did you really just say, "T-minus"?

1:34:35.375 --> 1:34:36.958
Yes. I did.

1:34:37.041 --> 1:34:39.166
And you're sure we have the right casino?

1:34:40.416 --> 1:34:41.791
Sorry. Sorry.

1:34:41.875 --> 1:34:43.500
Clearly a sore spot.

1:34:43.583 --> 1:34:44.750
I'm not missing my shot.

1:34:44.833 --> 1:34:46.708
At least if we cooperated
with the casino--

1:34:46.791 --> 1:34:51.041
No. We are not cooperating
with the casino.

1:34:51.125 --> 1:34:54.541
If we tell the casino, they might
move up the time of transfer.

1:34:54.625 --> 1:34:57.750
If they move up the time of transfer,
we miss our shot.

1:34:58.625 --> 1:34:59.791
I'm gonna catch them.

1:34:59.875 --> 1:35:01.500
-And end it--
-[man] Whoa!

1:35:01.583 --> 1:35:02.625
Listen to this.

1:35:02.708 --> 1:35:04.000
[Sebastian] I'm ready.

1:35:04.083 --> 1:35:07.791
My fingers are suitably warmed up
and ready for the cracking of the safe.

1:35:08.333 --> 1:35:10.375
[Korina] We wait
for the shift change at 5:00.

1:35:10.458 --> 1:35:12.333
That's our best shot. Copy?

1:35:12.416 --> 1:35:14.125
[Sebastian] Yes, I copy your copies.

1:35:14.208 --> 1:35:16.208
-[Korina] Just say copy.
-Is this what I think it is?

1:35:16.291 --> 1:35:18.041
-It seems it is.
-On an open channel?

1:35:18.125 --> 1:35:20.666
Not open,
just not encrypted enough to stop me.

1:35:21.625 --> 1:35:24.416
Okay, guys, 5:00 a.m., we move in then.

1:35:24.500 --> 1:35:26.875
Don't you think
it's just a little too good to be true?

1:35:28.875 --> 1:35:31.625
As I was saying,
keep watch on the perimeters.

1:35:31.708 --> 1:35:34.333
I don't want to miss
any tricks, understand?

1:35:42.375 --> 1:35:44.041
Okay. Go, go, go!

1:35:55.458 --> 1:35:59.125
Interpol. We're here about
a possible security risk to your vault.

1:35:59.208 --> 1:36:02.666
Yes, yes, we know. [in French] We are
informed about the risk.

1:36:03.250 --> 1:36:05.666
-[Delacroix] What do you mean?
-Please follow me.

1:36:10.166 --> 1:36:12.458
[singing jazz song]

1:36:15.750 --> 1:36:17.541
-[Delacroix] Who told you about the risk?
-You.

1:36:17.625 --> 1:36:20.541
And when you contacted us,
we took action immediately.

1:36:21.666 --> 1:36:23.750
What do you mean when we contacted you?

1:36:23.833 --> 1:36:26.208
[woman] You did. And as agreed,
we brought transport time forward.

1:36:26.291 --> 1:36:28.916
The safe left an hour and a half ago.

1:36:33.916 --> 1:36:37.166
-You brought the transport time forward?
-Yes.

1:36:37.708 --> 1:36:40.041
Last night,
when you informed us of the risk.

1:36:40.958 --> 1:36:43.750
But the transport is already underway.

1:36:44.791 --> 1:36:48.166
[Beatrix] Hmm. See, I told you
it was too good to be true.

1:36:49.375 --> 1:36:50.208
Why?

1:36:54.416 --> 1:36:56.666
It was planned for 5:00.

1:37:03.833 --> 1:37:05.083
[camera shutter clicking]

1:37:05.666 --> 1:37:06.916
[Korina] Hello. This is Interpol.

1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:10.416
Are you aware that the safe
scheduled for transfer tomorrow morning

1:37:10.500 --> 1:37:12.208
is the third in a sequence of safes,

1:37:12.291 --> 1:37:15.625
two of which
have been robbed in the last 72 hours?

1:37:15.708 --> 1:37:16.875
One moment, please.

1:37:18.500 --> 1:37:19.750
Call the bank.

1:37:19.833 --> 1:37:23.000
See if they'll authorize us
moving the vault sooner than planned.

1:37:23.083 --> 1:37:24.041
Of course.

1:37:24.125 --> 1:37:27.000
Call me if there's a problem.
You're welcome.

1:37:27.666 --> 1:37:29.416
[man in English]
Can't believe you drink that.

1:37:29.500 --> 1:37:31.291
Americans…

1:37:31.375 --> 1:37:33.708
Being American makes it trash.

1:37:33.791 --> 1:37:37.083
What about Zac Efron?
American actor, very good.

1:37:37.666 --> 1:37:39.500
Too bad he's a zombie now, isn't it?

1:37:39.583 --> 1:37:41.291
-No.
-[exclaims]

1:37:41.375 --> 1:37:42.750
The zombies got Zac Efron?

1:37:42.833 --> 1:37:43.958
[chuckling]

1:37:44.041 --> 1:37:46.041
You bastard. [laughs]

1:37:46.125 --> 1:37:48.166
[man] You should've seen
the look on your face.

1:37:48.250 --> 1:37:49.083
What the--

1:37:49.166 --> 1:37:50.875
[all grunting]

1:38:12.750 --> 1:38:13.750
[muffled scream]

1:38:21.250 --> 1:38:23.833
[Sebastian] But what about
the security inside the casino?

1:38:25.416 --> 1:38:28.000
[Gwendoline] We'll be gone
before they even know we're here.

1:38:28.958 --> 1:38:30.541
[man] Whoa! Listen to this.

1:38:33.875 --> 1:38:35.083
[Korina sighing]

1:38:36.458 --> 1:38:39.000
Fresh air feels so good.

1:38:39.083 --> 1:38:42.166
Ma'am, you cannot be up here.
You have to go back inside.

1:38:42.250 --> 1:38:44.125
I'm just here for a smoke.

1:38:45.958 --> 1:38:47.083
Ma'am, please.

1:38:47.666 --> 1:38:48.708
I'll tell you what,

1:38:50.250 --> 1:38:53.666
we can share.
And I'll be gone in a second, huh?

1:38:55.208 --> 1:38:56.958
Now listen-- [grunts]

1:38:57.041 --> 1:38:58.125
[exclaiming]

1:39:03.583 --> 1:39:06.541
-[Delacroix] Southwest corner?
-[man] All clear.

1:39:06.625 --> 1:39:07.708
Good.

1:39:40.750 --> 1:39:44.541
So you're sure you can crack it
while we drive?

1:39:45.125 --> 1:39:46.583
I shall attempt to do so,

1:39:47.375 --> 1:39:49.958
but please keep it as steady as you can.

1:39:50.041 --> 1:39:50.875
Okay.

1:39:51.583 --> 1:39:54.750
I'll make my way to the pier.
I'll get us as close as we can.

1:39:57.000 --> 1:39:59.000
[operatic music playing on phone]

1:40:21.291 --> 1:40:24.541
Siegfried. Hello, Siegfried.

1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:34.416
Do you know what happens
in Wagner's Siegfried?

1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:36.458
No, no. I don't know.

1:40:36.541 --> 1:40:37.916
Please tell me.

1:40:39.625 --> 1:40:43.083
In it, the hero Siegfried
faces his darkest of trials

1:40:43.666 --> 1:40:46.708
in order to understand
what it means to truly be afraid.

1:40:47.458 --> 1:40:49.291
He slays the dragon Fafnir

1:40:50.083 --> 1:40:52.750
and then he slays
the dwarf who raised him,

1:40:52.833 --> 1:40:54.666
when confronted with his betrayal.

1:40:56.875 --> 1:41:01.208
Then he finds Brünnhilde
and the two of them fall in love.

1:41:01.791 --> 1:41:03.541
After all the pain and fear,

1:41:04.958 --> 1:41:05.875
there's a happy ending.

1:41:08.041 --> 1:41:08.875
Oh.

1:41:08.958 --> 1:41:11.291
But what about the next opera?

1:41:11.375 --> 1:41:12.583
The Götterdämmerung?

1:41:12.666 --> 1:41:16.291
Siegfried dies and Brünnhilde
throws herself on his funeral pyre.

1:41:17.000 --> 1:41:18.541
[sighs] Gulp.

1:41:20.291 --> 1:41:22.708
Okay. [breathes deeply]

1:41:26.291 --> 1:41:27.583
[muttering]

1:41:29.250 --> 1:41:31.375
Calm down. Calm down.

1:41:34.916 --> 1:41:36.333
What do we have here?

1:41:38.750 --> 1:41:41.375
What do we have, Siegfried?

1:41:44.875 --> 1:41:46.375
[whispering indistinctly]

1:41:49.375 --> 1:41:50.250
[breathes deeply]

1:41:58.708 --> 1:42:02.041
[in French] Five o'clock!

1:42:05.291 --> 1:42:08.500
[in English] I swear to God,
if they find them before we do…

1:42:09.541 --> 1:42:12.833
The fucking balls
to double-cross their own team.

1:42:12.916 --> 1:42:15.375
To be fair,
we did also do a double cross on them.

1:42:15.458 --> 1:42:18.000
This is not the time, Rolph.

1:42:20.291 --> 1:42:23.000
[Delacroix] They must have
an accomplice right here in town.

1:42:23.083 --> 1:42:28.375
Search the town, every hotel,
come on, every van, everywhere.

1:42:29.916 --> 1:42:32.416
-Where are they going?
-Do we follow them?

1:42:33.000 --> 1:42:33.833
Where…

1:42:35.583 --> 1:42:36.625
I don't know.

1:42:37.541 --> 1:42:39.083
I don't know. I don't know.

1:42:47.041 --> 1:42:48.375
[Sebastian] First of seven.

1:42:49.666 --> 1:42:51.041
Okay, good.

1:42:51.125 --> 1:42:55.333
Listen, not to be an asshole,
but you did check the GPS, yeah?

1:42:55.416 --> 1:42:56.333
What?

1:42:57.666 --> 1:43:00.208
You checked the GPS
to see if her phone's still on?

1:43:00.291 --> 1:43:02.083
-You think I'm an idiot?
-I never said that.

1:43:02.166 --> 1:43:03.625
Of course I checked the GPS.

1:43:08.833 --> 1:43:10.125
You mind if I see?

1:43:32.875 --> 1:43:33.916
You see?

1:43:35.625 --> 1:43:36.833
Is that them?

1:43:37.541 --> 1:43:41.458
-[hesitates] Why did this just show up?
-[Rolph] That must be them!

1:43:43.250 --> 1:43:44.458
[Brad] Come on, let's go!

1:43:44.541 --> 1:43:45.666
Drive!

1:43:48.458 --> 1:43:49.666
No, no, no.

1:43:51.000 --> 1:43:52.333
[sirens wailing]

1:43:57.250 --> 1:43:58.583
Shit.

1:43:58.666 --> 1:43:59.541
Get her phone!

1:44:00.416 --> 1:44:02.041
Get her phone!

1:44:03.208 --> 1:44:04.958
Get the phone!

1:44:08.666 --> 1:44:09.500
No!

1:44:09.583 --> 1:44:11.333
Oh, fuck.

1:44:16.458 --> 1:44:17.541
[cell phone chimes]

1:44:19.500 --> 1:44:20.708
Damn it.

1:44:21.333 --> 1:44:23.375
Sebastian, Korina says they're coming.

1:44:23.458 --> 1:44:24.583
Where are we?

1:44:24.666 --> 1:44:26.041
I need to go faster.

1:44:26.125 --> 1:44:27.291
Lock four of seven.

1:44:27.958 --> 1:44:31.375
Okay, is there any way we could possibly
speed up the process?

1:44:31.958 --> 1:44:34.166
Hey, I go as fast as I fucking can!

1:44:34.250 --> 1:44:35.166
Sorry, yes.

1:44:35.750 --> 1:44:36.583
Keep going.

1:44:40.916 --> 1:44:43.083
-[Delacroix] Where are they?
-Where are who?

1:44:44.166 --> 1:44:45.875
I don't know what you're talking about.

1:44:45.958 --> 1:44:48.500
I'm just a girl on the street,
taking a walk.

1:44:48.583 --> 1:44:50.916
So you're not Korina Dominguez?

1:44:51.000 --> 1:44:54.250
Known associate of Gwendoline Starr
and Alexis Broschini?

1:44:54.333 --> 1:44:56.875
-Tell me you're not that girl.
-Vincent!

1:44:56.958 --> 1:44:58.416
-Let her…
-Where the hell are they?

1:44:58.500 --> 1:44:59.750
[in French] Let her go! Stop it!

1:44:59.833 --> 1:45:01.708
[in English] Where are they?
Don't fuck with me.

1:45:01.791 --> 1:45:03.208
Never heard of them. Never.

1:45:04.916 --> 1:45:06.083
Allow me to apologize for him.

1:45:07.083 --> 1:45:09.166
But, come on, woman to woman,

1:45:10.125 --> 1:45:13.375
do you really want all of this
pinned on you alone?

1:45:15.041 --> 1:45:17.041
Just tell us how they were gonna escape.

1:45:20.166 --> 1:45:21.250
Wait a moment.

1:45:22.291 --> 1:45:25.791
Just one piece of information,

1:45:25.875 --> 1:45:28.625
then I promise I'll do
everything in my power

1:45:28.708 --> 1:45:32.500
to make sure your little brother
is looked after.

1:45:42.291 --> 1:45:43.666
We're fucking getting them.

1:45:46.500 --> 1:45:47.958
You're just gonna scare them, right?

1:46:07.708 --> 1:46:09.500
[Delacroix] Okay. Come on, guys.

1:46:09.583 --> 1:46:11.250
We know where they're going.

1:46:11.333 --> 1:46:12.166
Let's go.

1:46:12.250 --> 1:46:13.500
[Beatrix] Good luck, team.

1:46:23.250 --> 1:46:24.708
[Sebastian over radio] Six of seven.

1:46:24.791 --> 1:46:26.166
[Gwendoline] Oh, no.

1:46:26.958 --> 1:46:29.166
Shit. Left turn!

1:46:42.875 --> 1:46:44.750
Okay, sorry, right turn!

1:46:46.833 --> 1:46:48.208
[grunting]

1:46:48.833 --> 1:46:49.833
[screaming]

1:46:51.791 --> 1:46:52.708
[exclaims]

1:46:52.791 --> 1:46:54.625
[screams]

1:46:54.708 --> 1:46:56.041
[panting]

1:46:56.125 --> 1:46:57.291
[grunting]

1:47:00.333 --> 1:47:03.583
I'm fine! I'm fine. Okay.

1:47:18.041 --> 1:47:18.916
[Gwendoline] Sebastian?

1:47:20.333 --> 1:47:21.208
You good?

1:47:25.166 --> 1:47:26.958
There is a happy ending.

1:47:34.375 --> 1:47:35.916
[gears clanking]

1:47:49.291 --> 1:47:50.625
I… I did it.

1:47:53.500 --> 1:47:56.208
Gwen, I did it. [laughs]

1:47:56.291 --> 1:47:58.208
-You did it?
-I did it.

1:47:58.791 --> 1:48:00.250
-Whoo!
-I cracked the Siegfried!

1:48:00.333 --> 1:48:03.000
[cheering]

1:48:03.083 --> 1:48:06.166
I did it. I fucking did it!

1:48:07.041 --> 1:48:08.250
Whoo!

1:48:08.333 --> 1:48:12.625
I'm a master. I did it!

1:48:54.541 --> 1:48:57.625
One thought that I've not been able
to cast out of my mind is…

1:48:59.541 --> 1:49:01.958
how sad it is that this great man,

1:49:03.041 --> 1:49:05.083
he devoted his life to this work.

1:49:05.166 --> 1:49:07.083
Nobody ever really appreciated it,

1:49:08.958 --> 1:49:10.666
or even understood his genius.

1:49:13.666 --> 1:49:16.791
Because in order to understand a work,
you must engage with it.

1:49:17.750 --> 1:49:21.666
And until now with Wagner's Ring cycle,
nobody could.

1:49:22.791 --> 1:49:24.375
What are you saying, Sebastian?

1:49:26.541 --> 1:49:27.666
I'm saying…

1:49:29.958 --> 1:49:31.208
I finally understand.

1:50:53.041 --> 1:50:53.916
Yes!

1:50:58.125 --> 1:50:59.291
It's over, Gwen.

1:51:00.875 --> 1:51:02.208
You made your choice.

1:51:04.166 --> 1:51:05.916
What are you going to do? Shoot me?

1:51:06.833 --> 1:51:07.875
Yeah, maybe.

1:51:10.375 --> 1:51:11.416
Will you take me back?

1:51:11.500 --> 1:51:12.583
[scoffs]

1:51:14.666 --> 1:51:15.583
Are you serious?

1:51:16.458 --> 1:51:18.916
Does that seem like something
an action hero would do?

1:51:19.000 --> 1:51:21.750
Point a gun in a girl's face
and tell her to come back to him

1:51:21.833 --> 1:51:23.375
or he'll blow her brains out?

1:51:24.583 --> 1:51:25.500
Fair point.

1:51:27.125 --> 1:51:28.916
Well, maybe hero time's over.

1:51:29.916 --> 1:51:31.875
Maybe I'm the villain after all.

1:51:31.958 --> 1:51:34.416
Not a villain. You're just a dick.

1:51:36.333 --> 1:51:37.250
[chuckles]

1:51:39.000 --> 1:51:40.208
-[clicks]
-[screaming]

1:51:40.291 --> 1:51:41.750
Oh, Gwen! Oh, God!

1:51:42.833 --> 1:51:44.000
No, no, no.

1:51:44.083 --> 1:51:45.750
-[clicks]
-[screaming]

1:51:45.833 --> 1:51:47.791
I took the firing pin out!

1:51:49.125 --> 1:51:50.333
You what?

1:51:51.041 --> 1:51:54.000
Okay. I really think
you could have told me this.

1:51:54.083 --> 1:51:57.166
I did tell you, but guess what?

1:51:57.250 --> 1:51:58.708
This gun works.

1:51:59.625 --> 1:52:01.958
I disabled yours
when you shot that Interpol agent…

1:52:02.041 --> 1:52:02.958
Gwen.

1:52:03.041 --> 1:52:05.625
…because I was afraid
that you would actually kill somebody.

1:52:05.708 --> 1:52:08.750
It's them or us. It was always them or us.

1:52:08.833 --> 1:52:12.291
It was just about you playing action hero,
compromising the team.

1:52:12.375 --> 1:52:15.125
-You're nothing without me.
-And me having to clean up--

1:52:15.750 --> 1:52:16.833
[groaning]

1:52:17.583 --> 1:52:19.750
-[exclaims]
-[Brad mutters]

1:52:19.833 --> 1:52:21.541
-[exclaiming]
-[laughs]

1:52:23.125 --> 1:52:25.333
Oh, you fucking pussy.

1:52:25.916 --> 1:52:27.666
-This guy?
-[screaming]

1:52:27.750 --> 1:52:29.791
Get to the truck now.

1:52:31.125 --> 1:52:34.041
-Is it too late for me to change sides?
-Get to the fucking truck!

1:52:35.041 --> 1:52:37.041
[Sebastian groaning]

1:52:38.750 --> 1:52:39.875
[Sebastian] Fuck me.

1:52:40.583 --> 1:52:41.791
[sirens wailing]

1:52:47.375 --> 1:52:50.500
This isn't over! You hear me?

1:52:50.583 --> 1:52:52.708
[yelling]

1:52:54.125 --> 1:52:55.750
I will find you, Gwen!

1:52:56.583 --> 1:52:59.041
You'll see. I'll find you both!

1:53:13.333 --> 1:53:15.041
[Brad] Bonjour.

1:53:18.166 --> 1:53:19.000
[chuckling]

1:53:19.083 --> 1:53:22.708
-[grunts]
-That's for shooting me in the ass.

1:53:23.833 --> 1:53:27.666
I'd do it again, Mr. Delay-croix.

1:53:27.750 --> 1:53:28.625
[both grunt]

1:53:29.333 --> 1:53:30.791
[in French] Delacroix, asshole.

1:53:32.125 --> 1:53:34.500
[in English] Whoo! Take them in.

1:54:05.333 --> 1:54:06.791
Uh, Gwen, um…

1:54:08.916 --> 1:54:09.750
Um…

1:54:11.333 --> 1:54:12.166
[sighs]

1:54:12.791 --> 1:54:15.208
I really like you a lot.

1:54:16.000 --> 1:54:18.958
And I just wanted
to take this opportunity to say it.

1:54:20.125 --> 1:54:22.791
You know you always choose
the worst time to…

1:54:22.875 --> 1:54:24.500
I'm, uh… [clears throat] I'm sorry.

1:54:50.291 --> 1:54:52.208
You know, I really like you a lot too.

1:55:14.250 --> 1:55:15.208
[Delacroix] Freeze.

1:55:18.833 --> 1:55:20.250
Hands in the air.

1:55:23.708 --> 1:55:24.708
Turn around.

1:55:26.125 --> 1:55:27.750
Turn around.

1:55:34.291 --> 1:55:35.791
Lower the gun or I shoot.

1:55:35.875 --> 1:55:38.625
[Sebastian] Gwen, what are you doing?
He'll shoot you.

1:55:46.583 --> 1:55:48.666
One more step and I shoot.

1:55:50.083 --> 1:55:53.875
Even if you make it to the boat,
you'll never make it out of the lake.

1:55:53.958 --> 1:55:54.958
It's over.

1:55:55.916 --> 1:55:58.208
Put your gun on the ground.

1:56:00.791 --> 1:56:02.416
We could work something out.

1:56:03.125 --> 1:56:06.958
We have three backpacks of cash.
You could take one of them.

1:56:08.375 --> 1:56:10.083
[Delacroix] I don't want your money.

1:56:11.041 --> 1:56:14.875
You have no idea
how long I've been chasing you.

1:56:14.958 --> 1:56:18.708
So get on the ground now.

1:56:20.250 --> 1:56:22.708
[whispering] Sebastian,
he's right. We won't make it.

1:56:24.708 --> 1:56:26.666
-What?
-But you can.

1:56:28.041 --> 1:56:30.166
There's no reason
he has to get both of us.

1:56:32.916 --> 1:56:35.541
-What are you saying? No, Gwen.
-We can't make it.

1:56:36.250 --> 1:56:37.208
Stay back!

1:56:41.791 --> 1:56:44.750
I'll come with you, but he goes.

1:56:46.083 --> 1:56:47.583
He's not going anywhere.

1:56:47.666 --> 1:56:49.208
You said it yourself.

1:56:49.291 --> 1:56:52.458
It's me you want. Me and Alexis.

1:56:52.541 --> 1:56:54.875
He has no part in this.
He's not a criminal.

1:56:59.125 --> 1:57:00.083
He's nobody.

1:57:01.833 --> 1:57:04.833
So if you want to take me in, he goes,

1:57:05.916 --> 1:57:08.125
or I'll shoot you
in your other fucking leg.

1:57:17.625 --> 1:57:18.666
Get the fuck out of here.

1:57:19.583 --> 1:57:20.416
What?

1:57:20.958 --> 1:57:23.250
Get the fuck out of here! Go!

1:57:24.166 --> 1:57:25.000
Go!

1:57:26.083 --> 1:57:27.041
Leave!

1:57:29.041 --> 1:57:30.541
I didn't see you.

1:57:30.625 --> 1:57:32.625
[Gwendoline] Sebastian, get out of here.

1:57:34.125 --> 1:57:35.041
No.

1:57:36.041 --> 1:57:37.125
No, I can't.

1:57:37.791 --> 1:57:39.333
Sebastian, get out of here.

1:57:40.458 --> 1:57:41.625
I can't.

1:57:43.125 --> 1:57:45.125
When I get out, I'll find you.

1:57:46.041 --> 1:57:47.541
And we'll find it together.

1:57:49.708 --> 1:57:52.958
If not, you find it for me, okay?
You find the Götterdämmerung.

1:57:53.041 --> 1:57:54.833
-No, Gwen, no, I can't.
-Go!

1:58:18.208 --> 1:58:19.541
Goodbye.

1:58:29.500 --> 1:58:31.250
[melancholy music playing]

1:59:31.416 --> 1:59:34.958
[Sebastian] Seeing that she had
not just gotten me a passport,

1:59:35.041 --> 1:59:37.666
but a plane ticket
to the same place she was going,

1:59:39.166 --> 1:59:40.708
it broke my heart.

1:59:41.625 --> 1:59:42.833
"Ludwig Dieter."

1:59:55.333 --> 1:59:59.000
It broke my heart thinking of
all the adventures we could have had,

1:59:59.708 --> 2:00:01.333
the things we could have shared,

2:00:02.000 --> 2:00:06.916
because in that moment, I knew
that of all the people in the world,

2:00:07.000 --> 2:00:09.250
there was only one I wanted to be with.

2:00:10.125 --> 2:00:11.125
And it was her.

2:00:12.583 --> 2:00:13.833
But that was okay.

2:00:14.791 --> 2:00:15.916
I would wait for her.

2:00:17.208 --> 2:00:21.833
And we would one day be reunited
in the vault of the Götterdämmerung.

2:00:58.833 --> 2:01:01.833
-[man] What are we doing here?
-You told me you needed a safecracker.

2:01:01.916 --> 2:01:03.083
Might be our missing piece.

2:01:03.583 --> 2:01:05.583
[operatic music playing over speakers]

2:01:10.250 --> 2:01:11.208
You the locksmith?

2:01:13.958 --> 2:01:15.083
Can you make sense of this?

2:01:20.375 --> 2:01:22.333
[woman] Hey, the guy in the front--

2:01:36.625 --> 2:01:39.666
You saw the old man in the front
and he sent you back here?

2:01:40.500 --> 2:01:41.416
[woman] Mm-hmm.

2:01:41.500 --> 2:01:43.250
You must really have a problem.

2:01:44.291 --> 2:01:48.458
How would you like to make 250 grand
for one day's work?

2:01:53.541 --> 2:01:54.625
Oh, my God.

2:01:57.291 --> 2:01:58.458
[man] Can you crack it?

2:01:59.083 --> 2:02:00.416
-Can I crack it?
-Yeah.

2:02:00.916 --> 2:02:02.083
[laughs]

2:02:03.416 --> 2:02:04.250
Can I crack it?

2:02:05.083 --> 2:02:08.708
This is like showing me a picture
of Botticelli's Madonna of the Magnificat,

2:02:08.791 --> 2:02:10.666
and asking me if I want to fuck her.

2:02:12.333 --> 2:02:16.875
Okay, the man who designed
this wonderful work of art,

2:02:16.958 --> 2:02:20.708
Hans Wagner, he named it
the Götterdämmerung

2:02:20.791 --> 2:02:22.875
for the final chapter in his namesake,

2:02:22.958 --> 2:02:27.208
Richard Wagner's epic opera
The Ring of the Nibelung.

2:02:28.000 --> 2:02:29.666
Can it be opened, and by me?

2:02:30.375 --> 2:02:32.708
-I don't know. I honestly don't.
-Okay.

2:02:32.791 --> 2:02:35.500
Watch your fingers, Mr. Big Hand.

2:02:35.583 --> 2:02:37.583
But of the world's living locksmiths,

2:02:38.166 --> 2:02:41.166
do I represent
your greatest chance of opening it?

2:02:41.250 --> 2:02:44.166
I can, with humility, say yes.

2:02:45.041 --> 2:02:46.125
You're in?

2:02:46.208 --> 2:02:48.083
It's a doorway
to another realm, my friends.

2:02:48.708 --> 2:02:50.875
And providence has brought you to me.

2:02:53.333 --> 2:02:54.666
We go through it together.

2:02:55.166 --> 2:02:57.166
[exciting orchestral music playing]
