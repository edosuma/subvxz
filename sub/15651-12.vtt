has mysteriously disappeared.

in O-Town history.

{\an1}Turkeys are meant
to be eaten.

can be saved!

04:48.037 --> 04:50.540
But the most important
thing to remember is

04:50.623 --> 04:52.208
that it wasn't my fault.

And the selfish slob won't
invite anyone for dinner!

NOW, WAIT JUST
A SECOND, THERE.

{\an1}If he were a halfway

08:08.321 --> 08:10.823

14:48.971 --> 14:51.515

15:13.579 --> 15:15.497
FOR <i> ONE</i> REASON.

15:15.581 --> 15:18.083
{\an1}WHAT REASON
IS THAT?

15:18.167 --> 15:19.209
FOLLOW ME.

15:24.548 --> 15:27.217
(<i> clears throat</i> )

15:27.301 --> 15:30.095
IT WAS ON THIS VERY ROCK

15:30.179 --> 15:32.139
OVER 200 YEARS AGO

15:32.222 --> 15:34.850
<i>[THAT MY ANCESTOR</i>
<i>JOHN QUINCY BIGHEAD</i>

15:34.933 --> 15:36.977
<i>MET WITH THE NATIVES</i>
<i>OF THIS AREA</i>

15:37.061 --> 15:40.731
<i>AND BY USING ALL</i>
<i>OF HIS VAST DIPLOMATIC SKILL</i>

15:40.814 --> 15:41.982
<i>HE NEGOTIATED THE PURCHASE</i>

15:42.066 --> 15:46.153
<i>OF ALL THE LAND</i>
<i>ON WHICH O-TOWN NOW STANDS</i>

15:46.236 --> 15:49.365
<i>FOR A MERE TWO DOLLARS</i>
<i>AND 98 CENTS IN CHANGE</i>

15:49.448 --> 15:50.157
<i>AND SOME BREATH MINTS.</i>

15:55.579 --> 15:57.289
<i>HE SURVEYED THE LAND</i>

15:57.373 --> 16:01.043
<i>AND ALTHOUGH IT WAS</i>
<i>99.3% SWAMPLAND</i>

16:01.126 --> 16:04.046
<i>HE REMAINED FIRM</i>
<i>IN HIS CONVICTIONS</i>

16:04.129 --> 16:06.965
<i>THAT THIS WAS THE BEST PLACE</i>
<i>TO FOUND...</i>

16:07.049 --> 16:08.717
<i>O-TOWN.</i>

16:10.886 --> 16:11.762
SO YOU SEE

16:11.845 --> 16:14.098
AS A BLOOD RELATION
OF THE FOUNDER

16:14.181 --> 16:16.266
I HAVE EVERY RIGHT
TO DECIDE

16:16.350 --> 16:18.227
WHO DOES AND <i> WHO DOES NOT</i>

16:18.310 --> 16:20.562
PARTICIPATE IN
THE CELEBRATION.

16:20.646 --> 16:21.397
OH, YEAH?

16:21.480 --> 16:24.274
WELL, THERE'S
A LITTLE SOMETHING

16:24.358 --> 16:25.734
YOUR ANCESTORS DIDN'T KNOW.

16:25.818 --> 16:28.570
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

16:28.654 --> 16:31.615
WATCH AND LEARN, LAUGHING BOY.

16:34.451 --> 16:36.787
O-Town Rock:

16:36.870 --> 16:39.498
nearly 200 years ago
on this spot

16:39.581 --> 16:42.000
John Quincy Bighead
bought the fetid swampland

16:42.084 --> 16:42.710
on which O-town was built.

16:42.793 --> 16:45.337
But today we aren't concerned

16:45.421 --> 16:47.339
with what took place
on that rock

16:47.423 --> 16:49.758
but what took place
beneath O-town Rock

16:49.842 --> 16:51.969
on that historic day.

16:53.011 --> 16:54.096
These turtle eggs, laid here

16:54.179 --> 16:58.767
during the Great Turtle
Migration almost 200 years ago

16:58.851 --> 17:00.602
actually predate
the O-town purchase

17:00.686 --> 17:01.937
by a matter of hours.

17:02.020 --> 17:04.857
The parent turtles
had to run out

17:04.940 --> 17:07.608
to get some throat lozenges,
but unfortunately

17:07.693 --> 17:10.612
because of a genetic propensity
for poor eyesight

17:10.695 --> 17:12.281
they were unable
to locate the nest again.

17:12.364 --> 17:15.951
{\an1}Eventually, they moved on,
and the eggs laid in this spot

17:16.034 --> 17:19.454
remained here
to become what we know today

17:19.538 --> 17:21.039
as the O-Town turtles.

17:21.123 --> 17:22.833
And that's the way it was...

17:22.915 --> 17:25.002
probably.

17:25.085 --> 17:26.502
SO, AS YOU CAN SEE

17:26.587 --> 17:30.340
{\an1}IT WAS <i> MY</i> ANCESTORS
WHO REALLY FOUNDED O-TOWN.

17:30.424 --> 17:32.551
ACTUALLY, O-TOWN WAS FOUNDED

17:32.634 --> 17:35.929

17:56.366 --> 17:56.992
<i>INTO TUXEDO VALLEY.</i>

17:57.076 --> 18:00.204
<i>THEY WANTED TO SETTLE THERE</i>

18:00.287 --> 18:03.457

18:48.335 --> 18:51.338
<i>THERE THEY BECAME</i>
<i>ROUGH, TOUGH LAWMEN</i>

18:51.421 --> 18:54.466

19:03.141 --> 19:05.561
<i>AND PUSHED IT ALL THE WAY HERE!</i>

19:05.644 --> 19:09.857
<i>THEN, THEY NOTICED</i>
<i>A SWORD STICKING OUT OF IT.</i>

19:09.940 --> 19:12.901
<i>ACTUALLY, IT WAS</i>
<i>AN ELECTRIC CARVING KNIFE</i>

19:12.985 --> 19:15.445

{\an1}IT'S ONLY SLIGHTLY
LESS BELIEVABLE

19:53.192 --> 19:54.943
THAN YOUR STORY, EGG-BOY.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.112
I HAVE SCIENTIFIC PROOF.

19:57.195 --> 19:58.947
LOOK AT THIS CHART.

19:59.031 --> 20:00.741
CHART, SCHMART--
THAT DOESN'T PROVE SQUAT.

20:00.824 --> 20:01.950
LISTEN HERE,
STEER-BOY

20:02.034 --> 20:04.745
DON'T TELL ME
WHAT I DON'T KNOW.

20:04.828 --> 20:07.122
{\an5}IF THERE'S ONE
THING I KNOW,
IT'S POTATOES.

20:07.205 --> 20:09.458
MY PARENTS INVENTED
THE POTATO FAMINE.

20:09.541 --> 20:09.833
{\an1}YOU SIMPERING
COW.

20:09.917 --> 20:11.460
THAT'S IT!

20:11.543 --> 20:13.086
{\an1}I WON'T STAY
AND BE INSULTED.

20:13.170 --> 20:14.296
{\an1}I'M TAKING MY ROCK
AND GOING HOME.

20:14.379 --> 20:19.092
{\an1}DON'T TOUCH THAT ROCK, YOU
BRAIN-DEAD BOVINE BLUBBERBUTT!

20:19.176 --> 20:23.472
THAT ROCK
IS A SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH SITE.

20:23.555 --> 20:26.767
{\an1}MY FOREFATHERS PUSHED IT HERE,
AND I'M PUSHING IT BACK!

20:26.850 --> 20:29.686
(<i> grunting</i> )

20:32.606 --> 20:34.524
{\an1}NO!

20:38.403 --> 20:41.657
TOO STRONG...

20:41.740 --> 20:42.991
CAN'T HOLD.

20:43.075 --> 20:45.369
I'LL HELP YOU, FILBURT.

20:55.754 --> 20:58.507
HEY! GET OUT
OF MY TROUSERS.

21:00.801 --> 21:02.010
{\an1}Rocko:
HEY, FELLAS

21:02.094 --> 21:02.844
LOOK AT THIS.

21:02.928 --> 21:06.181
"FIRST PLACE,
OK CORRAL EAT OUT."

21:06.264 --> 21:08.058
WOW, I <i> WAS</i> RIGHT.

21:08.141 --> 21:11.853
Filburt:
BUT LOOK DOWN THERE.

21:11.937 --> 21:14.272
MY FOREFATHER'S NEST.

21:14.356 --> 21:16.483
WAIT, IT'S MOVING.

21:16.566 --> 21:16.858
CRIKEY!

21:16.942 --> 21:17.693
COBBLERS!

21:17.776 --> 21:18.652
DINKY.

21:18.735 --> 21:20.570
TOO RIGHT.

21:20.654 --> 21:22.030
WHO THE BLAZES ARE YOU?

21:22.114 --> 21:23.031
HEY, ROCKO!

21:23.115 --> 21:25.534
THAT OLD COOT HAS
GOT YOUR SHIRT ON.

21:25.617 --> 21:26.493
THIS OLD RAG?

21:26.576 --> 21:28.078
IT'S THE
FAMILY COLORS.

21:28.161 --> 21:29.454
HEY, YOUNG FELLOW

21:29.538 --> 21:32.374
LOOKS LIKE YOU AND I
ARE PROBABLY KIN.

21:32.457 --> 21:34.918
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN UNDER THAT ROCK?

21:35.002 --> 21:36.044
FOR A DOG'S AGE.

21:36.128 --> 21:39.214
I HAVEN'T GONE ON WALKABOUT
FOR OVER 200 YEARS.

21:39.298 --> 21:40.173
All:
WOW!

21:40.257 --> 21:43.593
WHICH REMINDS ME,
I'VE BEEN DOWN BELOW

21:43.677 --> 21:46.346
LISTENING TO YOU JOKERS
FLAP YOUR GUMS.

21:46.430 --> 21:47.973
YOU'VE GOT IT ALL WRONG.

21:48.056 --> 21:49.558
WRONG? WHAT DO
YOU MEAN?

21:49.641 --> 21:50.475
HOW
DARE YOU.

21:50.559 --> 21:51.393
{\an1}HOW COULD I
POSSIBLY BE WRONG?

21:51.476 --> 21:54.396
{\an5}MY STORY HAS
BEEN PROVEN
TO BE TRUE.

21:54.479 --> 21:55.147
A TURTLE NEVER
FORGETS.

21:55.230 --> 21:57.733
{\an1}WALLABIES WERE
HERE BEFORE YOU.

21:57.816 --> 22:01.194
{\an1}MOST OF THEM MOVED ON
TO AUSTRALIA 200 YEARS AGO.

22:01.278 --> 22:02.654
I'D HAVE GONE, TOO

22:02.738 --> 22:06.408
{\an4}BUT YOUR IDIOT ANCESTORS
PUSHED A ROCK
OVER MY FRONT DOOR

22:06.491 --> 22:07.993
AND TRAPPED ME INSIDE.

22:08.076 --> 22:10.912
{\an1}OH, BY THE WAY, YOUR ANCESTOR,
J.Q. BIGHEAD

22:10.996 --> 22:14.624
{\an1}SHORTED THE NATIVE AMERICANS
BY 29 CENTS ON THEIR DEAL.

22:14.708 --> 22:15.500
WHAT?

22:15.584 --> 22:18.336
THAT'S RIGHT, AND
BY MY CALCULATIONS

22:18.420 --> 22:20.088
WITH INTEREST
TIMES 200 YEARS

22:20.172 --> 22:21.548
FIGURING FOR INFLATION

22:21.631 --> 22:23.759
YOU NOW OWE
THE NATIVE INHABITANTS

22:23.842 --> 22:26.762
$37,000 AND TWO TONS
OF BREATH MINTS.

22:26.845 --> 22:29.431
HERE'S A BILL.

22:29.514 --> 22:30.557
WE'LL EXPECT PAYMENT
IN 30 DAYS.

22:32.476 --> 22:35.103
30 DAYS?! HOW?

22:35.187 --> 22:39.191
YEAH, UH, "HOW"
TO YOU, TOO, SIR.

22:39.274 --> 22:40.734
GENTLEMEN.

22:42.527 --> 22:44.780
SO, SINCE YOUR
OLD GRAND MARSHAL

22:44.863 --> 22:46.073
IS A BIT
TONGUE-TIED...

22:46.156 --> 22:48.283
(<i> garbled</i> ):
I HATE MY LIFE.

22:48.366 --> 22:50.786
{\an1}...I'D SAY YOU FELLOWS
NEED A NEW GRAND MARSHAL.

22:50.869 --> 22:53.622
GRAND MARSHAL?

22:53.705 --> 22:57.084
(<i> all talking at once</i> )

22:57.167 --> 23:03.048
{\an1}(<i> marching band playing,</i>
<i>people cheering</i> )

23:04.966 --> 23:07.344
{\an5}Rocko:
THANKS SO MUCH
FOR ALL YOUR HELP.

23:07.427 --> 23:09.721
I MEAN, I NEVER KNEW
THAT WALLABIES

23:09.805 --> 23:12.307
{\an5}WERE THE FIRST
TO SETTLE HERE
IN O-TOWN.

23:12.390 --> 23:13.767
ACTUALLY, ALL I SAID WAS

23:13.850 --> 23:15.310
WE WERE HERE
BEFORE THE STEERS

23:15.394 --> 23:17.145
AND THE TURTLES
AND THE TOADS.

23:17.229 --> 23:19.981
{\an1}THERE MAY WELL HAVE BEEN
OTHERS HERE, EVEN BEFORE ME

23:20.065 --> 23:21.608
BUT I GUESS WE'LL NEVER KNOW.

23:24.778 --> 23:29.491
