( slurping )

00:55.322 --> 00:57.156
Huh.

00:57.158 --> 00:59.725
Authentic Mexican horchata
isn't supposed to have
dairy in it.

00:59.727 --> 01:01.360
So what?

01:01.362 --> 01:03.429
It isn't illegal
to make horchatas
with milk.

01:03.431 --> 01:05.597
Are you sugaring
your burrito?

01:05.599 --> 01:07.232
Food is anarchy, dude.

01:07.234 --> 01:09.935
Live by your own rules.

01:09.937 --> 01:11.003
Ugh.

01:11.005 --> 01:13.038
( muffled )
Want some?

01:13.040 --> 01:15.407
Keep your sacrilege
off my taco.

01:15.409 --> 01:17.776
Mmm.

01:21.948 --> 01:24.016
Whoo! Do I feel alive!

01:24.018 --> 01:26.218
You sure you don't
want a bite?

01:26.220 --> 01:27.786
Definitely sure.

01:27.788 --> 01:29.621
Who's up for fireworks?

01:29.623 --> 01:31.924
I can't see how that'd be
a good idea.

01:31.926 --> 01:33.592
'Cause I totally
wanna make fireworks.

01:33.594 --> 01:35.027
Bright-Glow Pyro!

01:35.029 --> 01:37.296
Sparkling Spiral Noodle!
Radical Rainbow Blast!!

01:37.298 --> 01:38.964
Rainbow glitter unicorn!!

01:40.133 --> 01:42.801
Star, might wanna
tone it down a notch.

01:42.803 --> 01:45.437
( siren blaring,
distorts, then stops )

01:45.439 --> 01:46.972
( gasps )

01:46.974 --> 01:48.607
Ooh!

01:48.609 --> 01:50.776
( panting )

01:50.778 --> 01:52.611
What the heck
was that?!

01:52.613 --> 01:54.713
I thought rainbows
were made of light.

01:54.715 --> 01:56.748
My rainbows are
made of stuff, okay?

01:56.750 --> 01:58.250
Okay, okay, okay.

01:58.252 --> 01:59.818
You just smashed
a police car.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.987
Oh, man.
This is fine, this is fine.

02:01.989 --> 02:03.622
What's the big
deal, Marco?

02:03.624 --> 02:05.891
I've done this
a thousand times.

02:05.893 --> 02:07.826
I'll just have my dad
give them some crowns.

02:07.828 --> 02:09.628
Call it even.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.263
Things don't work
like that on Earth.

02:11.265 --> 02:13.065
Here, you'll
go to prison.

02:13.067 --> 02:15.167
- You mean like Saint O's?
- It's worse than Saint O's.

02:15.169 --> 02:16.902
They give you
one bar of soap,

02:16.904 --> 02:18.770
and you have to make it
last a whole year.

02:18.772 --> 02:21.607
You gotta get up
every day at 4:00 a.m.

02:21.609 --> 02:23.642
and make hash browns
you're not allowed to eat.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.677
And they force you
to wear orange jumpsuits

02:25.679 --> 02:28.714
- every single day.
- Orange?!

02:30.183 --> 02:32.651
Ai. I don't know.
You tell me.

02:32.653 --> 02:35.420
They noticed
the dent.

02:35.422 --> 02:37.756
I guess I could
visit you in prison

02:37.758 --> 02:39.358
or whatever.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.593
There's only one thing
left for me to do.

02:41.595 --> 02:43.829
I'm gonna run away.

02:43.831 --> 02:45.264
Wait, wait, wait.

02:45.266 --> 02:47.466
No, that's not...
Running is worse.

02:47.468 --> 02:50.169
You can't stop me,
rule boy.

02:50.171 --> 02:51.770
Star, wait.

02:51.772 --> 02:55.274
I'll contact you when
I find a place to lay low.

02:57.510 --> 03:00.779
Look, if you can't read,
you can't do a crossword.

03:04.484 --> 03:06.685
Whoa!!

03:11.291 --> 03:13.792
Oh!

03:13.794 --> 03:16.728
No one'll find me here.

03:16.730 --> 03:18.897
Okay, first day in hiding.

03:18.899 --> 03:20.732
Where to start?

03:20.734 --> 03:22.568
Shelter.

03:25.338 --> 03:29.041
Okay, maybe something
less conspicuous.

03:34.347 --> 03:37.749
Not too shabby,
if I do say so myself.

03:43.723 --> 03:45.757
Good enough.

03:45.759 --> 03:48.627
( shivering )

03:55.335 --> 03:56.935
( squawks )

03:56.937 --> 03:59.338
( all squawking )

03:59.340 --> 04:01.373
Well, what are you doing
down here, sunshine?

04:01.375 --> 04:04.576
Uh, nothin'.
Just takin' a stroll.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.578
( stomach growling )

04:06.580 --> 04:08.580
Well, sounds like
someone's hungry.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.682
I'm about to make
some pancakes,

04:10.684 --> 04:11.750
if you'd like to join.

04:11.752 --> 04:14.019
I do like pancakes.

04:14.021 --> 04:17.389
Well, then, my house
is right through hair.

04:17.391 --> 04:18.757
Wait a second.

04:18.759 --> 04:21.426
Did you just say hair?

04:21.428 --> 04:23.762
Of course not,
my dear.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.697
( bird squawks )

04:27.567 --> 04:30.602
Okay. Mm, pancakes.

04:30.604 --> 04:36.308
Welcome to 80 square feet
of my own personal paradise.

04:36.310 --> 04:39.578
Oh, your home
is so cozy.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.313
A radical tapestry.

04:41.315 --> 04:43.415
Would you like
one pancake or two?

04:43.417 --> 04:44.816
Five, please.

04:44.818 --> 04:46.985
Wow!

04:46.987 --> 04:50.522
- Cool loft bed.
- Pancakes are ready.

04:53.393 --> 04:55.727
So you gonna tell me
what you did?

04:55.729 --> 04:57.229
What do you mean?

04:57.231 --> 04:59.164
Oh, hon, come on.

04:59.166 --> 05:00.932
Folks don't come down
to the river

05:00.934 --> 05:02.968
unless they broke
some of the rules.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.503
Your secret's
safe with me.

05:04.505 --> 05:06.905
Well... okay.

05:06.907 --> 05:09.841
So, like, I was with Marco
at Britta's Tacos,

05:09.843 --> 05:12.010
and we were eating,
and he was all, like,

05:12.012 --> 05:13.945
"Star, you can't put
sugar on your burrito."

05:13.947 --> 05:16.248
But what does he care,
ya know?

05:16.250 --> 05:19.117
So then I ate the burrito
and I wanted to
see some fireworks.

05:19.119 --> 05:21.820
Again, he's, like, "Star,
don't fireworks your burrito,"

05:21.822 --> 05:23.822
- and it's all like,
don't do this, don't do that.
- ( humming )

05:23.824 --> 05:27.259
Hey. My eyes are down here.

05:27.261 --> 05:29.928
Oh. I'm sorry, dear.

05:29.930 --> 05:32.464
Go on and finish
your story.

05:32.466 --> 05:35.000
So anyway, my rainbow
smashed a cop car.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.936
Jumped a fence and fell asleep
in some garbage by the river,

05:37.938 --> 05:39.438
and now I'm here.

05:39.440 --> 05:41.273
So... what did you do?

05:41.275 --> 05:43.041
Oh, you know.

05:43.043 --> 05:44.810
I steal hair.

05:44.812 --> 05:47.279
Oh, why would you do that?

05:47.281 --> 05:49.047
Oh, no, no, no,
sweetie.

05:49.049 --> 05:50.849
It's not like that.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.484
I don't take hair
from people.

05:52.486 --> 05:53.985
No, no, no.

05:53.987 --> 05:57.055
It's more of like
a back-alley kind of thing.

05:57.057 --> 05:59.358
You know, dumpsters,
behind hair salons,

05:59.360 --> 06:01.793
dog kennels--
discarded hair.

06:01.795 --> 06:04.796
So you do, like, witchy stuff
with the hair, right?

06:04.798 --> 06:07.132
Is that what this is?
You some kind of witch?

06:07.134 --> 06:09.534
Oh, goodness no, dear.

06:09.536 --> 06:12.070
You can do
lots of things with hair.

06:12.072 --> 06:14.806
I wove it into that tapestry
you like so much.

06:14.808 --> 06:16.675
Stuff your bed with it.

06:16.677 --> 06:18.910
Heck, you can even make
pancake batter from it.

06:18.912 --> 06:21.980
( laughs )
I'm just playin' with you.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.482
But seriously,
my favorite thing

06:23.484 --> 06:25.751
to do with the hair

06:25.753 --> 06:30.655
is to weave it into nests for
all my wounded forest friends.

06:32.992 --> 06:34.059
Aww!

06:34.061 --> 06:37.329
You can make
anything from hair.

06:37.331 --> 06:40.098
Well, anything...

06:40.100 --> 06:42.734
but love.

06:45.104 --> 06:48.106
Star, your family
loves you.

06:48.108 --> 06:51.042
Let's call them
and tell them you're okay.

06:51.044 --> 06:52.878
No, no, no.
You don't have to do that.

06:52.880 --> 06:54.713
Just let me stay
here with you.

06:54.715 --> 06:57.382
I can sleep anywhere.
Look. ( snoring )

06:57.384 --> 06:59.284
But this is no life
for a little girl.

06:59.286 --> 07:01.052
Let me help you.

07:01.054 --> 07:03.855
- No, thank you.
- Star!

07:03.857 --> 07:05.924
Wait. Come back.

07:05.926 --> 07:08.927
Hello. Operator.

07:08.929 --> 07:11.797
Whoa, whoa, stop.
Stop right there.

07:11.799 --> 07:13.632
I said stop.

07:13.634 --> 07:15.934
( dog barks )

07:15.936 --> 07:17.836
Who's walkin'

07:39.125 --> 07:40.559
( knocking )

07:40.561 --> 07:42.060
- Whoa.
- Excuse me.

07:42.062 --> 07:43.795
What is going on?

07:43.797 --> 07:46.398
I'm fishing, hamster pats.
What does it look like?

07:46.400 --> 07:48.233
Now go on.
Hidin' out here.

07:48.235 --> 07:49.634
You're gonna

you haven't made

Oh, no.

Enjoy the inside

smash that old squad car anyway.

10:22.656 --> 10:24.322
What? We were?

10:24.324 --> 10:26.825
At the annual police car
demolition derby.

10:26.827 --> 10:29.461
I was really looking
forward to smashing it.

10:29.463 --> 10:33.064
Phew! Well, if you
won't be needing me....

10:33.066 --> 10:35.266
I'll just see myself out.

10:35.268 --> 10:36.768
Just a moment.

10:36.770 --> 10:38.570
You're not getting off
that easy.

10:38.572 --> 10:41.006
Uh...

10:46.445 --> 10:49.080
You really can pull off
jumpsuit orange.

10:49.082 --> 10:50.982
I know, right?

10:50.984 --> 10:52.951
But enough of
this manual labor.

10:52.953 --> 10:55.120
It's magic time.

10:55.122 --> 10:57.589
Star, isn't that what
got you into this mess
in the first place?

10:57.591 --> 10:59.324
No, Marco. That was
the rainbow glitter,

10:59.326 --> 11:02.260
unicorn gnome hat, kitty bacon,
Hawaiian nightmare spell.

11:02.262 --> 11:04.396
Super geyser windstorm!

11:07.600 --> 11:09.934
Yeah, that was
totally me.

11:09.936 --> 11:12.404
My bad.
Nobody panic.
I'll put it back.

11:44.336 --> 11:46.004
I'm glad you're open.

11:46.006 --> 11:48.139
I'm starving.

11:48.141 --> 11:50.709
I'd like some
porridge, please.

11:50.711 --> 11:52.477
( snaps fingers )

11:54.513 --> 11:56.414
No!

12:02.388 --> 12:05.156
This is mud.

12:14.100 --> 12:15.633
That's not funny.

12:23.509 --> 12:27.078
You messed with
the wrong bird, rat.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.781
Face-melting death ray!

12:34.086 --> 12:36.287
Huh?

12:36.289 --> 12:38.356
( shrieks )

12:42.261 --> 12:44.429
Ow!

12:44.431 --> 12:46.297
( growls )

12:48.033 --> 12:52.470
( humming )

12:54.473 --> 12:55.974
Star!

12:57.810 --> 13:00.445
It's your turn
to take out the garbage.

13:00.447 --> 13:02.380
Marco, you've ruined
my Mewni battleship.

13:02.382 --> 13:04.482
Don't you think you have
enough ships in a bottle?

13:04.484 --> 13:07.152
Enough? I don't
even know you.

13:07.154 --> 13:10.088
Come on. We told Mom
and Dad we'd have
the place cleaned up

13:10.090 --> 13:13.324
before they got home,
and garbage is all yours.

13:13.326 --> 13:15.293
Oh, fine!

13:17.496 --> 13:19.497
Summoning cloudy charm.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.466
Cloudy, could you
take out the gar...

13:21.468 --> 13:23.568
( wheezing )

13:23.570 --> 13:25.303
Cloudy?

13:25.305 --> 13:26.638
( wheezing )

13:26.640 --> 13:29.274
( rattles )

13:29.276 --> 13:30.675
Cloudy?

13:30.677 --> 13:32.844
Oh, hey, Star.

13:32.846 --> 13:34.646
Uh, are you okay?

13:34.648 --> 13:37.282
Yeah. Perfectly fine.

13:37.284 --> 13:39.918
Okay.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.519
Could you take out
the garbage?

13:41.521 --> 13:42.921
Sure can.

13:42.923 --> 13:46.024
I guess princess hands
are too delicate

13:46.026 --> 13:47.859
to touch garbage.

13:47.861 --> 13:49.527
- What?
- Oh, nothing.

13:52.364 --> 13:54.632
Excuse me.
Pardon me.

13:54.634 --> 13:56.434
I got a mouthful
of garbage.

14:00.339 --> 14:01.773
I don't know, girls.

14:01.775 --> 14:04.042
Maybe this isn't
what it looks like.

14:04.044 --> 14:06.544
It looks like
a magic wand.

14:06.546 --> 14:08.479
What did I say?

14:08.481 --> 14:10.815
Follow three feet
behind me.

14:10.817 --> 14:12.717
Three!

14:12.719 --> 14:15.653
Yeah, anyway, I don't know,
maybe it's just a baby rattle.

14:15.655 --> 14:17.222
What are you doing?

14:17.224 --> 14:18.890
No. No, put it down.

14:18.892 --> 14:21.893
Let go, you nasty,
nasty thing.

14:21.895 --> 14:25.396
You let go of my thing!

14:29.702 --> 14:32.403
( gasps )

14:32.405 --> 14:34.138
What?!

14:34.140 --> 14:35.707
Do it again.

14:35.709 --> 14:39.244
Not you, you stupid...
( shrieks )

14:41.013 --> 14:43.982
I said not you, bird!

14:53.325 --> 14:55.393
Do it again.

15:00.599 --> 15:03.034
( evil laughter )
It's working, girls.

15:03.036 --> 15:05.036
Oh, no, no. No, no!
I was kidding.

15:05.038 --> 15:07.238
Please, let me go.
Let me go!

15:07.240 --> 15:10.508
Don't let me go!
( screams )

15:10.510 --> 15:13.478
( groaning )

15:15.614 --> 15:16.581
Oh, no.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.016
What happened?

15:18.018 --> 15:20.118
( groaning )

15:20.120 --> 15:22.287
I had an accident.

15:22.289 --> 15:23.621
( loudly ) Glossaryk!

15:23.623 --> 15:26.424
- Inside voices, please.
- Oh, sorry. Yeah.

15:26.426 --> 15:30.194
Uh, Glossaryk, there's
something funky happening
with my wand.

15:30.196 --> 15:32.263
Oh. What's wrong with it?

15:32.265 --> 15:34.565
It's acting weird.
It's not doing what
it's supposed to.

15:34.567 --> 15:38.102
Star, maybe there's
something wrong with you.

15:38.104 --> 15:39.871
You ever think about that?

15:39.873 --> 15:41.472
What's that supposed
to mean?

15:41.474 --> 15:43.408
Uh, I'm not 100% sure.

15:43.410 --> 15:45.977
I guess it means
there's something wrong...

15:45.979 --> 15:48.046
with everyone.

15:48.048 --> 15:49.314
I mean, look at me.

15:49.316 --> 15:51.649
I did magic
on my own face.

15:51.651 --> 15:54.285
- You know?
- No help as usual.

15:54.287 --> 15:57.488
It hurts everywhere!

15:57.490 --> 16:00.892
MARCO: Star, you're taking
care of the garbage, right?

16:00.894 --> 16:02.593
Yeah. I got Cloudy to do it.

16:02.595 --> 16:04.395
Uh, about that...

16:04.397 --> 16:06.030
( giggling )

16:08.067 --> 16:11.336
I don't know why
I have so much energy today.

16:11.338 --> 16:13.538
Must be all that iced tea.

16:26.485 --> 16:29.153
No, girls,
it's gonna get ugly.

16:29.155 --> 16:31.356
( mice squeaking )

16:31.358 --> 16:33.257
( Ludo humming )

16:48.941 --> 16:51.242
A bowl of your
finest mud, sir.

16:52.644 --> 16:56.280
Mm, I can taste it already.

16:56.282 --> 16:57.615
( snaps fingers )

17:07.526 --> 17:09.394
Ah!

17:11.563 --> 17:13.731
All done.

17:17.469 --> 17:18.703
Do your worst!

17:24.643 --> 17:26.744
( laughing )

17:26.746 --> 17:28.479
Ah! Whoopsie!

17:28.481 --> 17:29.847
What's with him?

17:29.849 --> 17:32.016
Cloudy, you stop this
right now.

17:32.018 --> 17:33.351
Giddy-up!

17:33.353 --> 17:35.620
- Are you listening to me?
- Whee!

17:37.856 --> 17:40.191
Stop playing around
and clean all this up.

17:40.193 --> 17:44.262
Uh-oh. Looks like
someone's allergic
to good vibes.

17:47.032 --> 17:48.766
( Cloudy laughs )

17:48.768 --> 17:50.835
Okay, that's enough.
Sunshine friendship.

17:50.837 --> 17:52.603
( mocking )
Sunshine friendship.

17:52.605 --> 17:53.938
Oopsie.

17:53.940 --> 17:55.907
My Mewni battleships!

17:55.909 --> 17:57.542
( growling )

17:57.544 --> 17:59.444
Sunshine friendship spell!

17:59.446 --> 18:05.416
Hey! That was sooooo rude!

18:22.968 --> 18:25.837
No, girls.
I'm fine.

18:27.873 --> 18:30.842
Come on, hit me
like you mean it!

18:35.647 --> 18:38.716
Now you're really
starting to tick me off.

18:55.634 --> 18:57.335
Run.

19:10.315 --> 19:14.152
( evil cackling )

19:16.155 --> 19:18.389
Cloudy, you're
out of control!

19:30.769 --> 19:32.503
That's it!

19:32.505 --> 19:34.005
Enough!

19:37.342 --> 19:40.578
Hey! You poked
my fluffies!

19:45.784 --> 19:47.852
I think you're
making him worse.

19:49.855 --> 19:54.458
You gotta stop!
Star!

19:54.460 --> 19:56.360
Marco!

20:01.667 --> 20:03.734
Raspberry ribbon lasso!

20:09.908 --> 20:12.043
Sunshine friendship spell!

20:16.248 --> 20:17.815
Oh! ( giggles )

20:22.254 --> 20:25.189
- You okay?
- Yeah, thanks to you.

20:25.191 --> 20:26.924
( Cloudy giggling )

20:26.926 --> 20:29.260
Whoa! What a mess!

20:29.262 --> 20:31.329
What happened?

20:31.331 --> 20:33.531
Yeah, what was up
with your wand?

20:33.533 --> 20:37.034
I have no idea.

20:37.036 --> 20:40.605
Kids, we got you ice cream
for cleaning the house.

20:46.745 --> 20:50.114
Oh, Star, it is always
exciting with you around.

20:50.116 --> 20:52.717
This'll take us
all weekend to clean.

20:52.719 --> 20:54.919
Oh, no, no.
I've got this.

20:54.921 --> 20:57.021
Tidying up tidal wa...

20:59.291 --> 21:01.525
You know what?

21:01.527 --> 21:03.828
Give me that thing.

21:07.766 --> 21:11.035
Oh, that's way better!

21:18.977 --> 21:20.945
Now...

21:20.947 --> 21:23.648
give me some porridge.
