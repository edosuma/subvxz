<i>NARRATOR". As you recall, we left
Batman and Robin staked out by Shame...</i>

00:14.641 --> 00:17.685
<i>...in the path of a cattle stampede.</i>

00:17.894 --> 00:21.564
<i>Things haven't improved any
since we left them.</i>

00:21.773 --> 00:24.692
<i>And in a moment,
we'll see what happens.</i>

01:37.473 --> 01:40.602
Just a few seconds left, Batman,
and there's no way out.

01:40.810 --> 01:43.479
Courage, Robin. Keep your mask up.

01:43.688 --> 01:46.816
The rumbling of the cattle zooms
has loosened my stake.

01:56.951 --> 01:59.537
Stay right where you are, Robin.
Don't make a move.

02:06.628 --> 02:07.754
Olé, Batman.

02:09.922 --> 02:11.549
Hey.

02:11.758 --> 02:13.801
Ha, ha. Bravo, bravo, more.

02:16.304 --> 02:21.934
- Olé.
-Olé, Batman. Olé.

02:38.034 --> 02:41.454
Oh. Unh. Phew.

02:42.288 --> 02:44.957
Oh. I always thought
they went for red capes, Batman.

02:45.166 --> 02:47.001
Merely an affectation, Robin.

02:47.210 --> 02:50.254
Something to make the corrida
seem more colorful.

02:50.463 --> 02:54.467
Actually, bulls are colorblind,
they react to movement, not to color.

02:54.676 --> 02:55.885
Holy toreador.

02:56.094 --> 02:57.762
The word is "matador," Robin.

02:57.970 --> 03:02.016
"Toreador" is a word of convenience used
by Bizet in his classic opera Carmen.

03:02.225 --> 03:04.811
- Oh. Holy matador, then.
-Very apt.

03:05.687 --> 03:09.941
Batman, Boy Wonder, what happened?
I thought it was all a game.

03:10.149 --> 03:14.654
It was, Andy,
the most dangerous game of all.

03:14.862 --> 03:17.490
And the stakes were life and death.

03:18.241 --> 03:19.867
And we darn near died.

03:20.076 --> 03:24.080
There's one thing in life you should learn,
it's to listen to your father and mother...

03:24.288 --> 03:27.667
...and I don't think they'd approve
of your association with Shame.

03:27.875 --> 03:30.545
You're right, Batman,
I should have known better.

03:30.753 --> 03:33.589
But after all, I'm only 7 years old.

03:34.549 --> 03:38.553
You're never too young to learn
the difference between good and evil.

03:38.761 --> 03:43.182
If I see him, I'll walk on the other side
of the street, I promise.

03:43.391 --> 03:45.476
But I'd sure like my radio back.

03:45.685 --> 03:47.687
We'll see about that.

03:47.895 --> 03:49.230
Let's go, Robin.

03:49.439 --> 03:53.818
We've set another youth on the road
to a brighter tomorrow.

03:54.026 --> 03:56.487
Goodbye, Andy.

04:02.243 --> 04:05.705
Now that we know he's building a truck,
we'll have to discard our theory...

04:05.913 --> 04:09.417
...that he's stealing parts so he can race a car
in the Gotham Grand Prix.

04:09.625 --> 04:12.670
Sure, and that 100,000 in prize money
is just cattle feed to Shame.

04:12.879 --> 04:15.423
Yet what could his reason be?

04:15.631 --> 04:17.759
I suggest we visit the one man
in Gotham City...

04:17.966 --> 04:20.344
...who knows what's happening
in the world of wheels.

04:20.553 --> 04:23.514
- Hot Rod Harry at KGC.
-Yeah.

04:29.562 --> 04:32.356
Good luck, Dynamic Duo.

04:34.025 --> 04:38.905
Shame, come back. Come back, Shame.
Shame, come back.

04:40.490 --> 04:42.909
And now, stay tuned for the news
on KGC.

04:43.117 --> 04:45.661
The number-one rated radio station
in the world.

04:45.870 --> 04:48.539
Stationville, breakville, nowsville.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.419
Well, hello, Caped Crusaders.
What can I do for you?

04:53.628 --> 04:56.881
Shame is building a super-fast truck.
We're trying to figure out why.

04:57.089 --> 05:00.009
Well, the drag races are all over
for the year...

05:00.218 --> 05:02.804
...other than that, I can't think of a thing,
Boy Wonder.

05:03.012 --> 05:06.766
Hey, there is one other cat who knows
more about where the automotive action is...

05:06.974 --> 05:09.352
...than the top-rated DJ in GC town.

05:09.560 --> 05:10.686
Who's that, Mr. Harry?

05:10.895 --> 05:14.482
Laughing Leo, the used car and truck magnate
on Surf Avenue and 20th Street.

05:14.690 --> 05:16.734
- Thank you.
-Keep punching, fellows.

05:23.741 --> 05:26.035
You have my word as a used car dealer.

05:26.244 --> 05:28.788
This car was formerly owned
by an oyster salesman...

05:28.996 --> 05:32.166
...who only drove it in months
with an R in them. Ha-ha-ha.

05:32.375 --> 05:33.584
I certainly hope so.

05:33.793 --> 05:37.630
I came all the way from Pasadena
to buy this car.

05:37.839 --> 05:39.924
- Bye,honey.
-Goodbye.

05:47.765 --> 05:50.810
Ha-ha-ha. Welcome, welcome.

05:52.603 --> 05:55.982
Hello, friends, looking for
a new or one-only used car?

05:56.190 --> 05:57.441
Not quite, we came to--

05:57.650 --> 06:00.486
Ah, that old job of yours is starting
to look a little bit tacky.

06:00.695 --> 06:02.864
Wouldn't be interested
in something more modern?

06:03.072 --> 06:07.159
I can put you in a beaut for only 1000 down
and this old clunker thrown in. Ha-ha-ha.

06:07.368 --> 06:10.872
Know of anything in the car world
that Shame might wanna get involved with?

06:11.080 --> 06:12.832
Shame? Ha-ha-ha.

06:13.040 --> 06:16.419
- Which Shame is that?
-The conniving cowboy of crime.

06:16.627 --> 06:18.963
Oh, that Shame. Ha-ha-ha.

06:19.171 --> 06:22.216
- Sorry, can't help you.
-Let's go, Robin, we'll get no place here.

06:22.967 --> 06:25.803
Look, 500 down, now, that's my last offer.
How about it?

06:26.012 --> 06:28.514
- Sorry, can't help you.
-Well...

06:29.849 --> 06:33.978
Come again. Ha-ha-ha. Goodbye.

06:46.616 --> 06:51.495
Oh, hello there, Laughing Leo,
you come over to give us more good news?

06:51.704 --> 06:54.498
Well, this truck's ready
to take on anything.

06:54.707 --> 06:58.461
Of course, it don't make a heap of difference
now that Batman and Robin took the big leap.

07:01.213 --> 07:03.257
- Funny you should mention that.
-Yeah.

07:03.466 --> 07:06.636
- We gonna steal them there Black Anguses.
-What, where Black Anguses?

07:06.844 --> 07:12.266
Oh, them prized cows at the Gotham City
Rodeo. Worth 300,000 bucks each.

07:12.475 --> 07:19.065
And four of them totals up to one million,
two hundred thousand, all together.

07:19.273 --> 07:22.985
Which we're gonna sell out west to
some unscrupulous cattle ranchers. Ha, ha.

07:23.194 --> 07:26.238
Boy, don't that just about
fry your eyeballs.

07:26.447 --> 07:28.699
Ha-ha-ha. I couldn't be happier.

07:28.908 --> 07:33.329
I ain't smiled so much since
I ran out of notch room on my gun handle.

07:33.537 --> 07:36.123
Batman and Robin done in.

07:36.332 --> 07:38.668
Us gonna get a potful.

07:38.876 --> 07:40.294
Things just couldn't be better.

07:40.503 --> 07:43.005
All right, Leo, what did you come
to talk to me about?

07:43.214 --> 07:46.008
Well, I don't quite know
how to tell you this, but, uh...

07:46.217 --> 07:49.720
Well, now, don't stand there
chewing your cud, spit it out, boy...

07:49.929 --> 07:52.306
...I don't like a dallying tongue.

07:52.515 --> 07:54.183
Batman and Robin are still alive.

07:54.392 --> 07:58.062
They came over to my place
asking questions.

08:11.283 --> 08:12.326
What's happened?

08:12.535 --> 08:15.538
He's angrier than a hyena
with laryngitis.

08:15.746 --> 08:17.873
- Shame?
-Hush up, Leo. When he gets this way...

08:18.082 --> 08:21.293
...maybe you don't see nothing,
but it ain't safe to ask no questions.

08:38.394 --> 08:41.105
And exactly where was the Wayne
limousine found, Alfred?

08:41.313 --> 08:44.817
On a shadowy side street, sir,
in a Gotham City suburb.

08:45.026 --> 08:47.653
I hope you didn't mind
my dismantling it for you.

08:47.862 --> 08:48.904
Not at all, Alfred.

08:49.113 --> 08:52.199
You saved us at least 15 minutes
by doing that.

08:52.408 --> 08:55.661
But I'm afraid we've struck out.

08:55.870 --> 08:58.622
There's not a fingerprint
to be found anywhere.

09:00.249 --> 09:02.293
- Here's the last item, sir.
Mm-hm.

09:03.335 --> 09:08.799
There's a tiny green speck
and an even tinier red speck on it.

09:09.008 --> 09:10.593
Robin, here, take a look at this.

09:12.053 --> 09:13.846
What do you think it is, Batman?

09:14.055 --> 09:17.058
The red speck appears to be chili
and the green speck is avocado.

09:17.266 --> 09:19.393
Do you know what that means?

09:19.602 --> 09:21.187
That Shame is a sloppy eater?

09:21.395 --> 09:28.152
Partly, but what restaurant serves the best
chili and avocado dip in Gotham City?

09:28.360 --> 09:29.528
Holy guacamole.

09:29.737 --> 09:32.698
The Adobe Hacienda Motel and Eats
on the inbound state highway.

09:32.907 --> 09:34.408
Let's go.

09:42.833 --> 09:45.169
We're too late, Batman,
now we'll never find him.

09:45.377 --> 09:47.254
Don't fret, old chum.

09:47.463 --> 09:49.507
Let's figure this out.

09:50.174 --> 09:52.093
Shame would have to hide until tonight...

09:52.301 --> 09:57.389
...because he can't travel during the daytime
in those peculiar looking clothes. Right?

09:57.598 --> 09:59.600
As rain, Batman.

09:59.809 --> 10:01.811
Where would a bunch like that hole-up?

10:02.019 --> 10:04.355
- You've got me.
-I think he went back to Westernland.

10:04.563 --> 10:06.690
He knows that we know
about his hideout there.

10:06.899 --> 10:10.861
Correct. However, knowing that, he'd think
that we'd think he would not return there...

10:11.070 --> 10:12.947
...therefore, he did and so will we.

10:13.155 --> 10:15.616
- Holy Bat-logic.
-Let's go.

10:30.422 --> 10:31.966
But boss, how did you know?

10:32.174 --> 10:37.388
I knew he'd think I'd think he'd think
I'd think he'd come back here.

10:44.186 --> 10:47.398
All right, you got clear aim.

10:47.606 --> 10:49.316
Let them have it.

10:50.985 --> 10:54.530
We've been bushwhacked. Quick,
behind the bullet-proof Bat-mobile.

10:58.659 --> 11:01.912
Another hero bites the dust,
I plugged the Boy Wonder.

11:06.083 --> 11:08.210
All right, let's vamoose.

11:11.380 --> 11:14.258
- Where did he get you, Robin?
-In the heel.

11:15.634 --> 11:20.431
We'll have to get that out fast.
Here, bite down on this.

11:24.435 --> 11:26.478
Steady, Robin.

11:30.107 --> 11:31.692
There.

11:33.485 --> 11:34.862
Let's go after them, Batman.

11:35.070 --> 11:37.114
No, we'll have to get you back
to the Batcave.

11:37.323 --> 11:39.283
Where you can get proper
medical attention.

11:39.491 --> 11:45.664
You'll need blankets, some hot water
and plenty of Baticillin.

11:49.210 --> 11:50.461
It feels perfect, Batman.

11:50.669 --> 11:53.797
The Baticillin lozenges
I gave you worked instantly.

11:54.006 --> 11:56.383
Too bad they got away
before we could question them.

11:56.592 --> 11:58.469
That's crime business, Robin.

11:58.677 --> 12:00.804
It's all in the game. Yes, Alfred.

12:01.013 --> 12:04.350
I beg your pardon, sir, but your scheduled
to serve as Grand Marshal...

12:04.558 --> 12:07.686
...at the annual Gotham City Rodeo.
-Great Scott.

12:07.895 --> 12:10.439
On the horns of our dilemma,
I'd overlooked that.

12:10.648 --> 12:12.441
Should be quite an interesting affair.

12:12.650 --> 12:16.862
Apart from the usual steer roping,
bulldogging and bare back riding...

12:17.071 --> 12:20.616
...there's the exhibition of the prized
Black Angus cattle.

12:21.283 --> 12:23.702
- What cattle?
-Black Angus, sir, four of them.

12:23.911 --> 12:28.707
Each worth more than $300,000
for, ahem, breeding purposes.

12:28.916 --> 12:31.418
- That's it, Robin.
-What's it, Batman?

12:31.627 --> 12:36.799
It's staring us right in our masks.
They must be what he's after.

12:37.007 --> 12:39.677
Alfred, call the coliseum commission...

12:39.885 --> 12:44.473
...and convey Bruce Wayne's regrets
that he will be unable to attend.

12:44.682 --> 12:47.101
But, sir, think of your public image.

12:47.309 --> 12:49.561
No one will miss Bruce Wayne
and Dick Grayson...

12:49.770 --> 12:53.399
...once they see Batman and Robin.
To the Batmobile.

13:04.451 --> 13:09.915
Now, nobody flick an eyelash,
this here is a holdup.

13:13.460 --> 13:16.922
I don't want them bacon drippings,
I got bigger fish to fry.

13:17.131 --> 13:18.299
- Rip.
- Yeah?

13:18.507 --> 13:20.592
- Get that freight elevator ready.
- Okay, boss.

13:20.801 --> 13:22.011
- Messy?
- Yeah, boss.

13:22.219 --> 13:24.847
- Get them cattle rounded up.
- Right, boss.

13:25.055 --> 13:28.017
All right, get in line. You heard me.

13:28.225 --> 13:31.395
Pull that cow out. Come on, move.

13:33.063 --> 13:36.358
Okie Annie, keep your gun
aimed on these folks...

13:36.567 --> 13:40.404
- ...and this time, aim to kill. Get it?
- Got it.

13:40.612 --> 13:42.072
Good.

13:55.377 --> 13:58.922
The rodeo is on the main floor,
but the bulls are shown on the upper level.

13:59.131 --> 14:01.091
What happens if we've guessed wrong,
Batman?

14:01.300 --> 14:02.968
If they aren't what Shame is after?

14:03.177 --> 14:08.349
Think positive, Robin.
But you do have a point.

14:10.726 --> 14:12.770
Stand clear.

14:19.360 --> 14:21.862
These short Bat-climbs are harder
than the longer ones.

14:22.071 --> 14:26.700
It takes a while to unlimber your muscles,
Robin. It's all good training.

14:29.286 --> 14:31.455
Colonel, what are doing here
in Gotham City?

14:31.663 --> 14:33.624
I'm looking for an underground agent.

14:33.832 --> 14:35.376
One of ours or one of yours?

14:35.584 --> 14:38.295
And why the exposition hall
at the coliseum?

14:38.504 --> 14:41.590
Who knows, you never know
where you might find one.

14:41.799 --> 14:43.592
Be careful not to get picked up.

14:43.801 --> 14:47.513
Chief O'Hara can be very tough
with aliens incognito.

14:47.721 --> 14:52.935
- Incognito? With my monocle?
-Well, say hello to Colonel Hogan for us.

14:53.143 --> 14:58.065
It's no wonder he hasn't tried to borrow your
Bat-rope to pull another one of his escapes.

15:04.029 --> 15:08.450
All right, now you folks
keep your feet planted on the ground...

15:08.659 --> 15:13.497
...and nobody will end with their toes
curled up, get it?

15:14.373 --> 15:16.291
Good.

15:30.139 --> 15:33.016
- What happened? Who did it?
-Uh-- Uh-- Uh--

15:33.225 --> 15:34.268
Which way did they head?

15:36.937 --> 15:38.230
What's he saying, Batman?

15:38.439 --> 15:41.442
Poor devil, he's in a state of shock,
Shame must have just left.

15:41.650 --> 15:43.360
- Come on, Robin.
-Where to?

15:43.569 --> 15:47.531
Through the window from whence we came.
We must capture Shame.

15:51.994 --> 15:53.537
What's wrong, Batman?

15:53.745 --> 15:56.582
They've already attained
a substantial lead over us, Robin...

15:56.790 --> 15:59.835
...plus, with the speed of that truck,
we'll never catch them now.

16:00.043 --> 16:04.631
- And they have one great advantage over us.
-Which is?

16:04.840 --> 16:07.634
They know where they're going.

16:07.843 --> 16:12.473
And they've already stolen a million,
200,000 dollars on the hoof.

16:12.681 --> 16:15.642
Unless we can employ some Bat-logic
and figure out their scheme.

16:15.851 --> 16:19.396
- Let's see. Steers have to be fed, right?
-Right.

16:19.605 --> 16:22.566
And it's not easy to hide four
such enormous, well-known animals.

16:22.774 --> 16:23.817
- Right?
-Right.

16:24.026 --> 16:26.737
They must've gone back
to the Gotham City Stockyards, right?

16:26.945 --> 16:29.573
- Wrong.
-Wrong. Wrong?

16:29.781 --> 16:32.659
If you wanted to hide a person,
would you hide him in a crowd?

16:32.868 --> 16:36.121
- Right.
-Right? It's easy to spot a person in a crowd.

16:36.330 --> 16:39.124
But it's not so easy to spot a person
in some isolated spot...

16:39.333 --> 16:41.001
...where you wouldn't have looked.

16:41.210 --> 16:42.836
- Ergo?
- Ergo...

16:43.045 --> 16:46.548
...Shame has probably taken
those cows to the corral.

16:46.757 --> 16:48.217
Sound thinking, Robin.

16:48.425 --> 16:52.137
Call Commissioner Gordon on
the Bat-telephone. Tell him to meet us there.

17:02.523 --> 17:04.942
Come back, Shame.

17:05.150 --> 17:09.738
Shame, come back. Shame.

17:11.323 --> 17:14.576
<i>NARRATOR".
Meanwhile, at the Gotham City stockyards...</i>

17:14.785 --> 17:21.625
<i>...Shame and his evil cohorts are feeding
the Black Angus cattle at the KO Corral.</i>

17:21.833 --> 17:25.295
Well, I guess we're done did it,
Laughing Leo.

17:25.503 --> 17:28.549
As soon as we get these critters fed
and watered, we'll hightail it out of here.

17:28.757 --> 17:33.720
Hee-hee-hee! Every arch criminal in the east
has been trying to outwit Batman for years.

17:33.929 --> 17:37.975
Ha-ha-ha! But it took a sun-tanned
westerner to do the trick.

17:38.183 --> 17:40.811
- You said a snootful, Leo.
- Mm!

17:41.019 --> 17:44.398
- Hey, boss, did you hear what I hear?
-Huh?

17:44.606 --> 17:48.402
- Did you hear anything?
-You hear anything?

17:48.610 --> 17:50.279
- What do you hear?
-The Batmobile.

17:50.487 --> 17:52.739
That's what I hear.
All right, now, take cover...

17:52.948 --> 17:55.742
...and this time, when you aim,
aim to bleed.

18:16.305 --> 18:19.725
There it is, Batman, the KO Corral.

18:19.933 --> 18:22.644
- Let's go.
-Steady, old churn.

18:23.145 --> 18:25.314
This could be a trap.

18:25.814 --> 18:30.485
- What do you think, Robin?
-it's awfully quiet.

18:31.028 --> 18:33.614
Too quiet for my money.

18:47.544 --> 18:51.923
Don't make a move, Batman,
or I'll fill you full of lead.

18:52.132 --> 18:55.010
You can't frighten us with a vague threat,
Shame.

18:55.218 --> 18:58.472
For a smart hombre,
you ain't got much savvy.

18:58.680 --> 19:00.932
This town ain't big enough
for the both of us.

19:02.267 --> 19:04.227
Draw.

19:07.814 --> 19:11.902
You and every other criminal know
that I don't carry firearms, Shame.

19:12.110 --> 19:15.113
Well, then, reach for your utility belt
so as I can do you in.

19:15.322 --> 19:18.492
Even the rottenest cowboy wouldn't
gun down two unarmed men.

19:18.700 --> 19:20.494
It's against the code of the old West.

19:20.702 --> 19:22.829
Them rules don't count
east of the Mississippi.

19:23.038 --> 19:26.249
If you're gonna murder us,
you're gonna have to do it without our aid.

19:26.458 --> 19:31.088
You may get two other notches in your gun,
but it won't help your reputation one bit.

19:31.296 --> 19:34.424
That's enough, Batman. One more move...

19:34.633 --> 19:38.261
...and you'll look like a big blue lump
of Swiss cheese.

19:38.470 --> 19:42.474
I got you covered six ways to Sunday.
Look around.

19:50.691 --> 19:54.486
At the moment of truth, do exactly as I do.

19:54.695 --> 19:58.990
All right, fellows and gal, let them have it.

20:07.541 --> 20:09.793
What do we do when the smoke clears,
they can draw a bead on us?

20:10.001 --> 20:13.547
- Shh, shh. I'm concentrating.
- It's a heck of a time to be concentrating.

20:13.755 --> 20:17.092
Let's see, nine guns with
six shots each, how many shots is that?

20:17.300 --> 20:19.386
- Fifty-four.
- I counted 53.

20:21.430 --> 20:22.472
They're out of bullets.

20:25.142 --> 20:28.520
Now we'll see if you guys are as brave
without guns for protection.

20:28.729 --> 20:29.813
Come on, Robin.

20:39.698 --> 20:41.700
Get them, Shame!

21:10.812 --> 21:13.064
Yippee! Yahoo!

21:14.900 --> 21:17.652
Ay! Ride him, cowboy. Ha, ha.

21:28.997 --> 21:31.208
You wouldn't hit a man with glasses,
would you? Heh.

21:31.416 --> 21:33.460
- You're not wearing glasses.
-Oh, I'm not?

21:34.711 --> 21:36.254
Laugh that off, Leo.

21:46.223 --> 21:48.099
Pardon me, ma'am.

21:56.066 --> 21:58.151
That's no way to prime a pump, Shame.

22:02.572 --> 22:07.202
Yeah, all right, partner,
it were a fair and square fight, Batman.

22:07.410 --> 22:09.663
It was fair because you couldn't use
your weapons.

22:09.871 --> 22:11.998
Great care must be taken
in the use of firearms.

22:12.207 --> 22:14.459
They can be quite dangerous
if used improperly.

22:14.668 --> 22:16.086
You said a mouthful.

22:17.546 --> 22:20.173
Shame, you just fired
your last shot in Gotham City.

22:20.382 --> 22:23.927
All right, you thieving spalpeens,
get going.

22:24.135 --> 22:28.139
Come on, into the wagon.
All right, now, come on, hurry up.

22:28.598 --> 22:30.767
Let's go. You too, come on.

22:32.060 --> 22:34.479
Batman, you've done it again.
May I shake your glove?

22:34.688 --> 22:38.024
- Of course, commissioner.
-Ha, ha. And yours too, Boy Wonder.

22:38.233 --> 22:41.278
I must admit,
we had a few tense moments with Shame.

22:41.486 --> 22:44.072
On the other hand,
I knew you would bring him to justice.

22:44.281 --> 22:45.991
- Oh?
-Well, don't you always?

22:46.199 --> 22:50.412
I like to think of you two as my own
personal blessings in disguise.

22:55.500 --> 22:59.129
In a few minutes, the authorities
will transport you all to the Calaboose.

22:59.337 --> 23:04.384
Well, I guess it's goodbye
for 99 years to life.

23:04.593 --> 23:07.762
The law is the law.

23:10.682 --> 23:14.269
This little tyke insisted on coming in.
Ha, ha.

23:14.519 --> 23:17.105
Ha, ha. Andy, what are you doing here?

23:17.314 --> 23:20.859
I've been yelling and screaming all over
Gotham City for Shame to come back.

23:21.067 --> 23:25.822
When I heard that he was in here,
I just reported myself as a lost little boy.

23:26.031 --> 23:29.993
- Why did you do that?
-Because this dirty old man stole my radio...

23:30.201 --> 23:33.955
...and if Morn ever found out about it,
she'd whale the tar out of me.

23:34.164 --> 23:37.918
Give me back my radio, Shame,
or you'll be in big trouble with my mother.

23:41.713 --> 23:47.135
Here. Send me a bill for the batteries.
Batman'll know my address.

23:47.344 --> 23:52.098
Well, what are you gonna do now, Andy?
You're not really a lost little boy.

23:52.307 --> 23:56.227
I was for a while, Batman,
but you made me find myself.

23:56.436 --> 23:58.688
I'm going straight
to the departmental store...

23:58.897 --> 24:01.483
...and trading this western outfit
for a Batman costume.

24:01.691 --> 24:03.526
I don't wanna be a cowboy anymore.

24:03.735 --> 24:06.279
I wanna be a hero like you,
caped crime-fighter.

24:06.488 --> 24:11.159
Being a hero or a crime-fighter
is not what counts the most, Andy...

24:11.368 --> 24:14.704
...it's growing up to be a good citizen,
and if that's what you meant...

24:14.913 --> 24:17.999
...it's the highest possible compliment
you could pay me.

24:18.708 --> 24:21.753
Good grief.
