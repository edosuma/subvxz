"Dear Josh, I can't wait for you

00:58.525 --> 01:00.727
I have been going through
my closet all morning.

01:00.727 --> 01:02.162
Now, which one
of these two says

01:02.162 --> 01:04.097
"Welcome back, Josh."

01:04.097 --> 01:05.265
I can't believe
you're obsessing

01:05.265 --> 01:06.900
over which outfit
is going to impress
a guy.

01:06.900 --> 01:07.768
Especially

01:07.768 --> 01:10.571
if we're talking about
those outfits.

01:10.571 --> 01:12.739
They both scream,
"Donate me!"

01:12.839 --> 01:14.708
The one on the
left is mine.

01:14.975 --> 01:16.076
Like I said...

01:16.076 --> 01:17.110
Great news.

01:17.110 --> 01:19.446
I just got a part-time job
at school.

01:19.446 --> 01:22.416
Yours truly has been chosen
to be a guinea pig

01:22.416 --> 01:24.084
for research experiments.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.218
That would explain
the phone jack

01:25.218 --> 01:26.253
sticking out
of your neck.

01:26.253 --> 01:27.387
F.Y.I., I'll be tying up

01:27.387 --> 01:28.388
the line for a while.

01:28.388 --> 01:29.556
The Organic Computer Lab

01:29.556 --> 01:31.291
is expecting
my afternoon brain dump.

01:31.291 --> 01:33.860
There's really no way
to respond to that, is there?

01:33.860 --> 01:34.828
Hey...

01:34.828 --> 01:35.729
nice outfits.

01:35.729 --> 01:37.064
That settles it.

01:37.064 --> 01:38.999
I'm calling Goodwill.

01:40.133 --> 01:41.602
Aunt Hilda, what
time is it?

01:41.602 --> 01:43.637
Oh, time for you
to stop annoying me.

01:43.637 --> 01:46.373
Sabrina, Josh's plane doesn't
land for another four hours.

01:46.373 --> 01:47.908
I know. It's just
that I want to make sure

01:47.908 --> 01:49.443
that I have enough time
to get cleaned up

01:49.443 --> 01:50.477
give myself a manicure.

01:50.477 --> 01:51.511
Tweeze that
ugly ingrown...

01:51.511 --> 01:52.079
Ooh.

01:52.079 --> 01:53.680
And hello to you.

01:53.981 --> 01:54.915
Big news...

01:54.915 --> 01:57.117
I've been selected
to throw a party

01:57.117 --> 01:58.185
for the President
of Adams College.

01:58.185 --> 02:00.120
I'd rather hear about tweezing.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.655
You were saying,
ingrown...

02:01.655 --> 02:03.056
ZELDA:
Hilda...

02:03.056 --> 02:05.459
the school is divvying up
a major donation

02:05.459 --> 02:07.761
and the science department
has chosen me

02:07.761 --> 02:09.529
to appeal
to President Banning.

02:09.529 --> 02:10.631
Won't be difficult.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.132
Lord knows I'm appealing.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.333
And now we
all know.

02:13.500 --> 02:16.203
I just need a place
to throw the party.

02:16.203 --> 02:18.305
It has to be somewhere unique,
yet intimate.

02:18.305 --> 02:19.706
Casual, yet classy.

02:19.706 --> 02:21.375
Mmm, where could that be?

02:21.375 --> 02:23.944
Java Joint that's
been dead all summer?

02:23.944 --> 02:25.646
Sister with no cash flow?

02:25.646 --> 02:28.281
You want me to have a cocktail
party in a coffee house?

02:28.281 --> 02:30.984
I don't see a coffee house.

02:31.685 --> 02:36.023
There. You got your intimate,
your casual, your classy.

02:36.023 --> 02:38.692
My freakin' luck.

02:38.825 --> 02:40.627
I'll make sure that classy
has the night off.

02:40.627 --> 02:42.062
Armando will be filling
in for her.

02:43.930 --> 02:46.433
Hilda, you've got the job.

02:48.402 --> 02:50.570
Oh, she makes it too easy.

02:53.273 --> 02:54.741
Aunt Hilda, I've
got coffee grounds

02:54.741 --> 02:55.842
in every hole in my head.

02:55.842 --> 02:57.411
Do you mind
if I take the night off?

02:57.411 --> 02:58.412
Go ahead, Sabrina.

02:58.412 --> 03:00.313
It's not like we have
any customers coming in.

03:00.313 --> 03:01.882
Except that guy.

03:02.916 --> 03:03.850
Josh!

03:03.850 --> 03:04.985
Hey...

03:05.652 --> 03:06.753
Oh...

03:06.953 --> 03:08.121
I took an earlier flight.

03:08.121 --> 03:09.389
I couldn't wait to see you.

03:09.389 --> 03:11.224
Oh, you look great,
and I look terrible.

03:11.224 --> 03:12.826
Your timing stinks
worse than I do.

03:12.826 --> 03:16.163
Sabrina, I just spent 19 hours
on a flight from Istanbul

03:16.163 --> 03:17.964
sharing a blanket
with a goat.

03:17.964 --> 03:19.900
You smell great.

03:20.434 --> 03:22.335
Wow, I know you've only
been gone a couple months

03:22.335 --> 03:23.370
but there's
something different

03:23.370 --> 03:24.337
about your whole energy.

03:24.337 --> 03:25.772
Yeah? Well, I feel different.

03:25.772 --> 03:29.076
Oh, I got so many stories to
tell you and pictures to show
you.

03:29.076 --> 03:30.410
Pictures later,
kisses now.

03:30.711 --> 03:32.345
Okay. Mmm.

03:33.814 --> 03:35.816
Oh, I wish you could have
been with me in Prague.

03:35.816 --> 03:38.018
I got to hang out
with the senior editor

03:38.018 --> 03:39.252
of <i>The Prague Forward.</i>

03:39.252 --> 03:40.620
You mean
Voicek Sznitsky?

03:40.620 --> 03:41.621
You know him?

03:41.621 --> 03:42.656
Well, I feel
like do.

03:42.656 --> 03:43.990
You mentioned him
in every email.

03:43.990 --> 03:45.125
Oh, right.

03:45.125 --> 03:46.626
Well, I couldn't have
told you this--

03:46.626 --> 03:49.096
before I left, he said there
might be a job for me over there

03:49.096 --> 03:50.130
as a photo journalist.

03:50.130 --> 03:51.131
How cool would that be?

03:51.131 --> 03:52.599
<i>Josh wants to go</i>
<i>back to Prague?</i>

03:52.599 --> 03:54.134
That place is so amazing.

03:54.134 --> 03:55.635
Picture this, all right?

03:55.635 --> 03:58.939
5,000 Czechs protesting
a beef by-products plant

03:58.939 --> 03:59.639
and me...

03:59.639 --> 04:00.073
<i>He just got here</i>

04:00.073 --> 04:02.075
<i>and he's thinking</i>
<i>about leaving.</i>

04:02.075 --> 04:03.744
<i>What about our</i>
<i>romantic dinners?</i>

04:03.744 --> 04:05.045
<i>I got us Red</i>
<i>Sox tickets.</i>

04:05.045 --> 04:07.380
<i>I pre-paid for</i>
<i>those suckers.</i>

04:07.380 --> 04:08.715
Sabrina,
are you listening?

04:08.715 --> 04:10.784
Oh, yeah. You know, Czechs,
beef by-products...

04:10.784 --> 04:11.752
sounds like heaven.

04:11.852 --> 04:12.919
The culture's so different

04:12.919 --> 04:14.321
but the people
are friendly and...

04:14.321 --> 04:15.422
<i>This is serious.</i>

04:15.422 --> 04:17.157
<i>I've got to make sure</i>
<i>Josh stays in Boston.</i>

04:17.157 --> 04:19.092
<i>Quick. Think of something</i>
<i>exciting and original.</i>

04:19.092 --> 04:20.527
Hey, you want
to come over
for dinner?

04:20.527 --> 04:21.528
Oh, I'd love to.

04:21.528 --> 04:23.296
But can we do it
tomorrow night?

04:23.296 --> 04:24.531
I'm totally jet-lagged.

04:24.531 --> 04:27.534
Plus, I think I picked up
a bug from the goat.

04:32.339 --> 04:34.474
Ooh, this looks good.

04:37.444 --> 04:38.578
Mmm. Eggy.

04:38.578 --> 04:40.514
It's not for you.

04:40.514 --> 04:43.250
It's for the romantic dinner I'm
making for Josh tomorrow night.

04:43.250 --> 04:45.085
He's thinking about
moving back to Prague.

04:45.085 --> 04:47.120
I've got to find positive
reasons to stay here.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.421
Forget the positive.

04:48.421 --> 04:51.258
If you want to influence
somebody's decision

04:51.258 --> 04:53.593
you have to accentuate
the negative.

04:53.593 --> 04:54.728
What's the negative?

04:54.728 --> 04:56.429
Living in Prague is his dream.

04:56.429 --> 04:59.900
Unless you make it
his nightmare.

05:03.236 --> 05:05.639
"Josh is sleeping like a log

05:05.639 --> 05:07.107
but wait until
he gets to Prague."

05:08.508 --> 05:11.478
( <i>snoring</i> )

05:17.117 --> 05:19.419
It's 20 degrees in here.

05:19.719 --> 05:21.721
Even the rats have had enough.

05:21.721 --> 05:23.790
Where's that landlady already?

05:23.790 --> 05:25.025
Come on!

05:26.593 --> 05:29.162
What now, Yankee Doodle?

05:29.162 --> 05:30.463
I want heat.

05:30.463 --> 05:31.565
Wait till August.

05:31.565 --> 05:33.967
You'll be <i>shvitzing</i>
like nobody's business.

05:33.967 --> 05:36.670
I didn't come to Prague
to live like a P.O.W.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.605
Oh, then maybe you
shouldn't have come

05:38.605 --> 05:40.040
ungrateful American pig-dog.

05:40.040 --> 05:42.742
Yeah, I'm thinking
the same thing!

05:42.742 --> 05:45.245
That went well.

05:45.245 --> 05:46.580
Got to go.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.822
Whoa, what research group
roughed you up?

05:55.822 --> 05:57.858
The exotic pet
feasibility study.

05:57.858 --> 05:58.658
Sadly

05:58.658 --> 06:00.460
squirrels will never be

06:00.460 --> 06:01.695
our trusted friends.

06:01.995 --> 06:05.098
Miles, you are officially the
most desperate person I know.

06:05.098 --> 06:07.167
I need ointment
and I need it now.

06:07.167 --> 06:08.501
You're doing
these experiments, too?

06:08.501 --> 06:09.536
Hey, 20 bucks
is 20 bucks.

06:09.536 --> 06:10.637
We'd better
get cleaned up

06:10.637 --> 06:13.173
if we're going to
make it to Project
Heat Stroke.

06:15.175 --> 06:19.279
Oh, Sabrina, making a romantic
dinner for your boyfriend...

06:19.279 --> 06:20.847
how provincial.

06:20.847 --> 06:22.749
Do I detect
a note of jealousy?

06:22.749 --> 06:25.352
Me? Jealous?

06:25.352 --> 06:27.487
Just because you got Josh

06:27.487 --> 06:29.456
when he finally decided
to look like something

06:29.456 --> 06:31.358
and get all sexy.

06:31.358 --> 06:33.894
God, he is so hot now that...

06:33.894 --> 06:35.729
Hello? Still in the room.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.898
Boy, if I knew he'd
turn out like this

06:37.898 --> 06:39.599
I never would
have dumped him.

06:39.599 --> 06:41.301
Excuse me, didn't he dump you?

06:41.301 --> 06:43.904
So, what are you making
for dinner?

06:44.938 --> 06:46.573
( <i>soft piano music playing</i> )

06:46.573 --> 06:48.174
Hello, nice to see you.

06:48.174 --> 06:49.209
Thanks for coming.

06:49.476 --> 06:50.510
Live long and prosper.

06:50.510 --> 06:52.012
Hilda, you really
pulled it off.

06:52.012 --> 06:55.515
President Banning seems to
be having a fabulous time.

06:56.983 --> 06:59.052
He seems to be
having a coma.

07:04.457 --> 07:07.994
May I just tell you what an
enchanting smile you have?

07:07.994 --> 07:09.596
Thanks. You want
to see more

07:09.596 --> 07:10.864
of these
pearly whites

07:10.864 --> 07:13.700
throw some of
that grant money
into astrophysics.

07:13.700 --> 07:14.801
Actually, I was talking

07:14.801 --> 07:17.270
to the vision of loveliness
next to you.

07:19.239 --> 07:20.573
I mean you.

07:20.573 --> 07:22.108
I'm Wayne Banning.

07:22.108 --> 07:23.777
Oh, and I'm
Hilda Spellman.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.812
Nice to meet you,
Wayne Banning.

07:25.812 --> 07:28.982
And now, back to
<i>Wayne Banning, Private Eye.</i>

07:28.982 --> 07:30.050
You're funny, Hilda.

07:30.050 --> 07:31.151
Thanks.
You know, sometimes

07:31.151 --> 07:32.252
I do standup comedy here.

07:32.252 --> 07:33.186
ZELDA:
Hilda

07:33.186 --> 07:34.654
I don't think
President Banning

07:34.654 --> 07:36.323
wants to hear about
standup comedy.

07:36.323 --> 07:38.124
Oh, no, I love standup comedy.

07:38.124 --> 07:40.260
Those Wayans brothers,
they're wild.

07:40.260 --> 07:42.529
Yes. I hear they've
got hilarity

07:42.529 --> 07:43.897
down to a science.

07:43.897 --> 07:45.432
Oh, speaking of science

07:45.432 --> 07:47.600
did you hear about that
new Jewish space station?

07:47.600 --> 07:48.568
The ShMir?

07:48.568 --> 07:50.236
( <i>laughing</i> )

07:50.236 --> 07:52.372
Would you both excuse me?

07:52.372 --> 07:54.207
I need to freshen up a little.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.576
( <i>doorbell rings</i> )

08:01.815 --> 08:06.853
<i>Sie schauen heute</i>
<i>abend so reizend aus.</i>

08:07.454 --> 08:09.556
I just told you look
lovely in German.

08:09.556 --> 08:11.858
Oh, and what prettier
language to say it in.

08:11.858 --> 08:12.659
And...

08:12.659 --> 08:14.761
Oh, thanks, Josh,
they're beautiful.

08:14.761 --> 08:17.197
That's a European-
style bouquet.

08:17.197 --> 08:19.733
Those flowers are
all hand picked.

08:19.733 --> 08:21.935
Really?
From where?

08:21.935 --> 08:23.303
People's yards.

08:23.303 --> 08:25.805
Mmm, something
smells great.

08:25.805 --> 08:26.873
Oh, I hope you're hungry.

08:26.873 --> 08:28.775
Oh, by the way,
how did you sleep last night?

08:28.775 --> 08:29.909
Not so good.

08:29.909 --> 08:32.645
I had this horrifying dream
about Prague.

08:32.645 --> 08:34.180
Ooh, what a nightmare.

08:34.180 --> 08:36.916
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.

08:39.085 --> 08:40.320
It's been lovely, Hilda.

08:40.320 --> 08:41.955
It certainly has,
Wayne Banning.

08:41.955 --> 08:42.956
Good night.

08:42.956 --> 08:44.090
Good night.

08:44.090 --> 08:45.158
Hey, lady!

08:45.158 --> 08:46.192
Hey, Dean!

08:46.192 --> 08:47.360
( <i>laughing</i> )

08:48.294 --> 08:51.064
Oh, what a great president.

08:51.064 --> 08:53.366
Hilda, you occupied
every minute of his
time.

08:53.366 --> 08:54.601
President Banning and I

08:54.601 --> 08:57.203
never even got to discuss
the science department.

08:57.203 --> 08:59.572
Relax. I'll make sure
to mention it to Wayne

08:59.572 --> 09:01.041
when we go out on our date.

09:01.141 --> 09:02.175
Your date?

09:02.175 --> 09:03.843
That's right;
our date.

09:03.843 --> 09:05.512
I'm going out
with your boss.

09:05.512 --> 09:07.614
Which means, if he
and I get married

09:07.614 --> 09:09.015
I'll be your step-boss.

09:09.015 --> 09:10.884
I'm starting to
see a hierarchy.

09:10.884 --> 09:13.053
I'm higher,
and you're archy.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.255
Wow, Josh, these
pictures are great.

09:15.255 --> 09:17.323
You know, you really
managed to capture

09:17.323 --> 09:19.893
the bleak and hellish
atmosphere that is Prague.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.661
Sabrina,
what are talking about?

09:21.661 --> 09:23.897
It's sunny out
and everybody's smiling.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.065
Whatever.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.000
( <i>beeping</i> )

09:27.000 --> 09:29.335
Oh. A voice-mail message.

09:29.335 --> 09:31.604
You know, I dropped
some resumes off
around town today.

09:31.604 --> 09:33.306
Maybe somebody called me back.
You mind?

09:33.306 --> 09:34.441
No. Go for it.

09:34.841 --> 09:36.509
Hey, and while
you're doing that

09:36.509 --> 09:39.712
I'm going to go get your
favorite all-American dessert.

09:42.449 --> 09:46.319
Great, how did you remember
I loved apple pie?

09:49.222 --> 09:51.424
Sabrina, you're not
going to believe this.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.026
I just a job
on the newspaper.

09:53.026 --> 09:54.027
No way.

09:54.027 --> 09:55.562
Way! It starts in a week.

09:55.562 --> 09:56.463
Get out of town.

09:56.463 --> 09:57.363
I'm going to have to.

09:57.363 --> 09:58.098
What do you mean?

09:58.098 --> 09:59.132
The message was from

09:59.132 --> 10:00.433
the editor of
<i>The Prague Forward.</i>

10:00.433 --> 10:01.701
The job is in
the Czech Republic.

10:01.701 --> 10:04.537
Wow. The Czech Republic.

10:04.537 --> 10:06.873
That is so... pie?

10:12.078 --> 10:14.047
I can't believe
they offered me this job.

10:14.047 --> 10:15.582
Me, either.

10:15.582 --> 10:16.583
I also can't believe

10:16.583 --> 10:17.951
I'm going to have
to leave you again.

10:17.951 --> 10:18.785
Hey, maybe

10:18.785 --> 10:19.919
you could come over there--

10:19.919 --> 10:20.920
do a semester abroad.

10:20.920 --> 10:22.722
You want me to move to Prague?

10:22.722 --> 10:24.591
What about your awful nightmare?

10:24.591 --> 10:26.593
Sabrina, it was just a dream.

10:26.593 --> 10:27.427
The night before that

10:27.427 --> 10:28.695
I dreamt I was playing poker

10:28.695 --> 10:30.196
with a pack of German shepherds.

10:30.196 --> 10:31.097
I can't give up

10:31.097 --> 10:32.832
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

10:32.832 --> 10:34.100
because of a bad dream.

10:34.100 --> 10:37.570
Well, you got to do
what you got to do.

10:38.404 --> 10:41.141
Sabrina, you really
don't want me to go, do you?

10:41.141 --> 10:43.443
Me? Not want you to go?

10:43.443 --> 10:44.611
Why would you think that?

10:44.611 --> 10:45.578
I mean, just because
the timing has

10:45.578 --> 10:46.613
finally worked out
between us

10:46.613 --> 10:48.248
and you're finally not
seeing anyone

10:48.248 --> 10:49.816
and I'm finally
not seeing anyone.

10:49.816 --> 10:51.718
I mean, big deal if we're
finally together

10:51.718 --> 10:53.887
in the same place
after I waste an
entire Summer

10:53.887 --> 10:56.756
thinking about you
and waiting for you
to finally come home.

10:56.756 --> 10:59.225
And who cares if I thought
maybe, just maybe we had

10:59.225 --> 11:00.660
some sort of future
together

11:00.660 --> 11:02.162
but, you know, of course
I want you to go, okay?

11:02.162 --> 11:03.062
So go.

11:03.897 --> 11:04.898
Sabrina...

11:04.898 --> 11:07.400
Look, Josh, please, just go.

11:14.274 --> 11:15.909
Ooh, 9:00, no boyfriend.

11:15.909 --> 11:18.545
Never a good sign
for a romantic dinner.

11:18.545 --> 11:20.547
Josh got a job
offer in Prague

11:20.547 --> 11:22.081
and he's actually
going to take it.

11:22.081 --> 11:24.150
Oh, I'm really sorry, Sabrina.

11:24.150 --> 11:25.652
If it's any consolation

11:25.652 --> 11:29.055
some of my best relationships
have been long distance.

11:29.055 --> 11:32.158
No petty fights and you save
a fortune on waxing.

11:32.158 --> 11:34.093
I don't even know if he's going
for six months, a year

11:34.093 --> 11:35.528
or the rest of his life.

11:35.962 --> 11:37.864
And what if he meets
someone else?

11:37.864 --> 11:40.800
Sabrina, I've been to Prague
in Senior Competition.

11:40.800 --> 11:42.235
He'll be back.

11:45.238 --> 11:47.574
You've been a worthy
opponent, foe.

11:47.574 --> 11:51.244
Until now. The end is nigh.

11:52.812 --> 11:53.680
Checkmate.

11:53.680 --> 11:56.749
It's your word
against mine, lady.

11:56.749 --> 11:58.117
You are a rotten cat.

11:58.751 --> 12:00.119
Hilda, you look stunning.

12:00.119 --> 12:01.120
Thanks, Zellie.

12:01.120 --> 12:02.789
Oh, by the way,
I borrowed your purse

12:02.789 --> 12:05.024
you shoes and a splash
of your designer perfume.

12:05.024 --> 12:07.660
$400 an ounce,
and designed specifically

12:07.660 --> 12:09.195
for my body chemistry.

12:09.195 --> 12:10.496
No biggie.

12:10.863 --> 12:12.098
Just remember, please

12:12.098 --> 12:14.000
to mention the science
department

12:14.000 --> 12:15.235
to President Banning.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.303
And find out why
his eyes glaze over

12:17.303 --> 12:18.705
whenever I bring it up.

12:18.705 --> 12:21.975
Perhaps it's
because you're
an insufferable bore.

12:21.975 --> 12:22.976
Just pitching.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.043
Wait, Zelda.

12:24.043 --> 12:26.813
Black Beastie here
has a point.

12:26.813 --> 12:29.515
Wayne is under a tremendous
amount of stress

12:29.515 --> 12:31.651
you know, ruling
a college and all.

12:31.651 --> 12:34.821
He gravitates towards
people with a sense of humor.

12:34.821 --> 12:37.890
And you're saying
I don't have one?

12:38.291 --> 12:39.892
I took the last bullet.

12:39.892 --> 12:42.128
This one's yours.

12:43.863 --> 12:46.232
Maybe Josh and I just aren't
destined to be together.

12:46.232 --> 12:49.402
Maybe not.
But the good news
is you're only 19.

12:49.402 --> 12:51.537
You've got plenty of time
to find the one.

12:51.537 --> 12:52.905
( <i>watch beeps</i> )

12:52.905 --> 12:54.007
I, however, have

12:54.007 --> 12:56.175
only ten minutes to meet
the chimp in the psych lab.

12:56.175 --> 12:59.846
I'm going to finish that puzzle
before Bobo if it kills me.

13:00.413 --> 13:02.915
You look like
you're enjoying
that petting

13:02.915 --> 13:04.083
a little too much.

13:04.083 --> 13:06.052
Is it wrong to be a man?

13:06.052 --> 13:07.220
Don't ask me.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.322
I'm not exactly the authority
on men these days.

13:09.322 --> 13:12.258
Oh, and your suggestion to give
Josh a nightmare about Prague

13:12.258 --> 13:13.393
was completely useless.

13:13.393 --> 13:15.928
Sometimes I just like
to hear myself talk.

13:15.928 --> 13:17.697
I just wish I knew how things
were going to work out

13:17.697 --> 13:18.931
between me and Josh.

13:18.931 --> 13:21.134
Sabrina, if you want to know
your destiny

13:21.134 --> 13:25.738
why not go right to the source
and ask him out?

13:25.738 --> 13:29.509
Of course. A date with Destiny.

13:30.576 --> 13:45.224
♪♪

13:47.126 --> 13:47.760
Whoa.

13:48.061 --> 13:49.896
Yeah, I get that a lot.

13:50.196 --> 13:51.564
You're Destiny?
Yeah.

13:51.731 --> 13:53.366
I thought you were
supposed to be old as Time...

13:53.366 --> 13:55.301
With the long white
beard and flowing robes

13:55.301 --> 13:57.003
and a winged chariot?

13:57.003 --> 13:57.737
No, most women like
this look better

13:57.737 --> 13:59.172
but if you want
me to change...

13:59.172 --> 14:01.140
No, no, no!
This works for me.

14:01.140 --> 14:02.208
Okay, all right.

14:02.208 --> 14:04.344
I brought the chariot
if that helps you.

14:04.344 --> 14:05.345
Oh, cool.

14:05.345 --> 14:06.479
( <i>horse whinnying</i> )

14:06.479 --> 14:09.749
Even his horse is gorgeous!

14:11.517 --> 14:13.820
That was the best meal
I've ever had

14:13.820 --> 14:14.821
and what a view.

14:14.821 --> 14:15.521
Yeah, I bet you
didn't know

14:15.521 --> 14:17.357
there was a bar and grill
at the top of Mt. Everest.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.525
Or that the swordfish would be
so fresh.

14:19.525 --> 14:21.260
So, can we talk about Josh now?

14:21.260 --> 14:23.162
Later.
You ever been to the opera?

14:23.162 --> 14:25.465
No, but I've always wanted
to go.

14:25.598 --> 14:28.601
So, is <i>The Mikadoeverything</i>
you thought it would be?

14:28.601 --> 14:29.635
It's incredible.

14:29.635 --> 14:31.871
I'm so worried
about Nanki-Poo
and Yum-Yum

14:31.871 --> 14:33.873
and so happy for
Katisha and Ko-Ko.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.409
No small thanks
to Pitti-Sing and Poo-Bah.

14:36.409 --> 14:37.243
I like them.

14:37.744 --> 14:39.312
Listen, about this
Josh thing...

14:39.312 --> 14:41.748
Hey, after the opera
are you up for some dancing?

14:41.748 --> 14:42.749
You dance?
Yeah.

14:42.749 --> 14:44.584
I thought it was
"Date with Destiny"

14:44.584 --> 14:45.618
"Dance with Death."

14:45.618 --> 14:46.686
We were roommates
in college.

14:46.686 --> 14:48.454
We made a few trades.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.533
Listen, I hate
to wreck the mood...

15:00.533 --> 15:01.701
Then don't.

15:02.902 --> 15:05.438
I have to ask you a question
about my boyfriend.

15:05.438 --> 15:06.873
I want to know
what's going to happen
between me and Josh.

15:06.873 --> 15:08.674
I mean, is he going
to move to Prague

15:08.674 --> 15:09.642
love it
and never come back

15:09.642 --> 15:11.277
or is he going to hate it
and come right back

15:11.277 --> 15:14.013
or am I going to rethink
my life and go there with him?

15:14.013 --> 15:15.748
Well, if
you're asking me
what your destiny is

15:15.748 --> 15:18.317
the answer is
I have no clue.

15:18.317 --> 15:20.520
But you're Destiny.
You decide these things.

15:20.520 --> 15:21.788
I used to.

15:21.788 --> 15:23.890
I haven't made a significant
decision since King Arthur.

15:23.890 --> 15:25.925
It's been all downhill
since the sword and the stone.

15:25.925 --> 15:26.893
But I kept

15:26.893 --> 15:29.495
the name, though,
you know, for the dates.

15:29.495 --> 15:30.730
What happened to you?

15:30.730 --> 15:33.132
Not to me, to the world.

15:33.599 --> 15:36.135
Things got more complicated,
issues arose--

15:36.135 --> 15:37.904
free will, rational thought.

15:37.904 --> 15:40.339
So what you're saying is
I created my own destiny?

15:40.339 --> 15:42.008
There's nothing
you can do for me?

15:42.008 --> 15:43.242
I'm not totally worthless.

15:43.242 --> 15:45.244
I may not be able
to tell you your destiny

15:45.244 --> 15:47.947
but I can give you a preview
of the different scenarios.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.383
Well, I don't need to see
Josh happy without me

15:50.383 --> 15:52.118
and I don't want
to see him fail.

15:52.118 --> 15:54.120
Maybe you could show me
what it would be like

15:54.120 --> 15:56.289
if I took a semester abroad
and moved to Prague.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.890
Okay, done.

15:59.926 --> 16:01.594
Sabrina, I'm home.

16:01.594 --> 16:03.329
Hi, sweetie, how was your day?

16:03.329 --> 16:04.430
Unbelievable.

16:04.430 --> 16:05.932
One of my pictures
is getting

16:05.932 --> 16:07.200
the front page tomorrow

16:07.200 --> 16:08.501
plus I'm going
to be doing

16:08.501 --> 16:09.869
a photo layout
with the Pope.

16:09.869 --> 16:10.970
How was your day?

16:10.970 --> 16:12.305
Oh, I can't complain.

16:12.305 --> 16:15.541
Went to class, didn't
understand a word
anyone said.

16:15.541 --> 16:18.211
Oh, and on the way home
I bought a potato.

16:18.211 --> 16:19.345
Fantastic!

16:19.345 --> 16:21.948
We've been on the list
to get a potato for months!

16:21.948 --> 16:24.517
Oh, and I got tickets
to the Prague Film Festival

16:24.517 --> 16:25.518
for next weekend.

16:25.518 --> 16:27.653
Opening night is a tribute
to Kevin Bacon.

16:27.653 --> 16:29.489
Boy, do I miss bacon.

16:29.489 --> 16:29.856
Next weekend?

16:29.856 --> 16:32.124
That's when the paper's
sending me to Paris.

16:32.124 --> 16:33.125
Again?

16:33.125 --> 16:34.861
I'm the man.
Now, come on.

16:34.861 --> 16:38.164
Let's pop that spud
in the oven and chow down.

16:38.164 --> 16:41.634
Oh, I love our life.

16:43.269 --> 16:45.171
Losing to that lab
monkey was bad enough

16:45.171 --> 16:47.273
but now we spent more
money on tetanus shots

16:47.273 --> 16:49.008
and cortisone creams
than we earned

16:49.008 --> 16:50.443
from these stupid
experiments.

16:50.443 --> 16:51.577
I think we should quit.

16:51.577 --> 16:53.746
No way, Roxy.

16:53.746 --> 16:56.082
This is no longer
about money for me.

16:56.082 --> 16:57.016
What else is there?

16:57.016 --> 17:00.419
Fringe acceptance
in the scientific community.

17:00.953 --> 17:02.154
Pass the Bactine.

17:02.455 --> 17:06.192
Sir, can I get you
anything else? Sir?

17:07.660 --> 17:12.565
Rude, uncultured
American pig-dog.

17:12.565 --> 17:13.699
I'm taking a five.

17:15.568 --> 17:17.503
Sabrina, I left you
a thousand messages.

17:17.503 --> 17:18.504
Where have you been?

17:18.504 --> 17:21.140
The opera, Mt. Everest,
potato shopping.

17:21.140 --> 17:22.275
I don't blame you

17:22.275 --> 17:23.276
for still being mad
at me.

17:23.276 --> 17:24.777
I was such an idiot
yesterday.

17:24.777 --> 17:26.279
I had my head
so far up Prague

17:26.279 --> 17:28.347
I wasn't thinking
about you at all.

17:28.347 --> 17:31.217
Well, I was thinking
about you.

17:31.217 --> 17:32.385
I can't hold
you back, Josh.

17:32.385 --> 17:33.953
You've got to take
that job.

17:33.953 --> 17:35.821
You've got to follow
your destiny.

17:35.955 --> 17:38.190
What about you
coming with me?

17:38.190 --> 17:41.060
Prague is your dream,
not mine.

17:42.194 --> 17:43.629
I'm going
to miss you, Sabrina.

17:43.829 --> 17:46.365
I'm going to
miss you, too,
Yankee Doodle.

17:46.766 --> 17:48.401
I mean, Josh.

17:50.136 --> 17:52.939
Thus, vis-a-vis
the Yankelman Effect

17:52.939 --> 17:55.875
the Economics department
deserves 59%

17:55.875 --> 17:58.578
of the fund allocation.
Thank you.

18:02.748 --> 18:05.885
Okay, who's next?

18:07.286 --> 18:09.355
59%, please.

18:11.190 --> 18:13.826
Good afternoon,
President Banning

18:13.826 --> 18:14.994
and friends.

18:14.994 --> 18:17.997
Science has always had
a tentative place

18:17.997 --> 18:19.265
in the social order.

18:19.265 --> 18:23.502
In 1687, Sir Isaac Newton,
the founder of modern science

18:23.502 --> 18:25.538
is reported to have been a...

18:26.973 --> 18:29.408
nutty professor!

18:30.676 --> 18:32.645
Hey, Dean!

18:33.412 --> 18:35.781
How many of you hate to fly?

18:35.781 --> 18:39.018
And what about those people
who shove those two-ton bags

18:39.018 --> 18:40.519
in the overhead bins, huh?

18:40.519 --> 18:43.522
Just 'cause it has a handle
doesn't mean it's a carry-on.

18:45.024 --> 18:47.193
And what about those
in-flight movies, huh?

18:47.193 --> 18:48.794
Yeah, I want to watch <i>Gladiator</i>

18:48.794 --> 18:50.663
on a screen
the size of a Triscuit.

18:51.764 --> 18:53.899
A screen the size of a Triscuit.

18:54.433 --> 18:56.068
Is this thing on?

18:56.068 --> 18:58.804
A better question,
Professor Spellman, might be

18:58.804 --> 19:02.341
does the Science department
take fund allocation seriously?

19:02.341 --> 19:04.076
Oh, of course, it does.

19:04.076 --> 19:06.379
Then why would it send
a comedian to plead its case?

19:06.379 --> 19:09.281
You can't fool me.
I know you love a good laugh.

19:09.281 --> 19:10.650
Key word being "good."

19:10.650 --> 19:14.053
Yes, well, on that note

19:14.387 --> 19:15.988
I'll just turn things over

19:15.988 --> 19:17.957
to the talented
and fabulous head

19:17.957 --> 19:19.959
of the Asian Studies department.

19:19.959 --> 19:22.695
I'm here all week. Try the veal.

19:22.695 --> 19:26.165
Hey, when are you driving
Josh to the airport?

19:26.165 --> 19:27.400
In a couple of hours.

19:27.800 --> 19:29.468
I'm so sorry, Sabrina.

19:29.468 --> 19:30.336
Thanks, Morgan.

19:30.336 --> 19:33.005
Traffic is going
to be horrendous.

19:33.372 --> 19:35.541
Do you hear yourself
when you speak?

19:35.541 --> 19:37.843
Depends on what I say.

19:42.415 --> 19:43.382
Oh!

19:44.083 --> 19:46.085
That's disgusting.

19:47.119 --> 19:49.555
Oh, great, chunky-style milk.

19:50.122 --> 19:51.757
( <i>doorbell rings</i> )

19:54.960 --> 19:57.463
Oh, you're 0 for four
in the timing department.

19:57.463 --> 19:58.631
This couldn't wait.

20:00.032 --> 20:02.902
Uh, Sabrina,
I'm not going to Prague.

20:02.902 --> 20:04.036
What are you
talking about?

20:04.036 --> 20:05.738
You already
told the editor
you were coming.

20:05.738 --> 20:07.173
He'll understand
when I tell him

20:07.173 --> 20:09.408
I have an even better
opportunity here in Boston.

20:09.408 --> 20:11.010
You got another
job offer?

20:11.010 --> 20:16.015
No. Sabrina,
the opportunity I have here

20:16.015 --> 20:17.049
is to be with you.

20:17.049 --> 20:19.185
There will be
other Pragues.

20:19.185 --> 20:21.587
You're a once-
in-a-lifetime offer.

20:21.587 --> 20:23.422
You're my destiny.

20:28.260 --> 20:30.396
Nobody panic.
I'm fine.

20:30.396 --> 20:31.864
I'm just highly allergic

20:31.864 --> 20:34.133
to a genetically engineered
variety of wasp.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.135
That's the bad news.

20:36.135 --> 20:37.803
There's good news?

20:37.937 --> 20:41.674
Oh, yeah. Brunch is on me.

20:47.947 --> 20:49.181
I've had a
great week, Wayne.

20:49.181 --> 20:50.182
Me, too.

20:50.182 --> 20:52.017
I may not be
a joke teller

20:52.017 --> 20:53.886
but I'm a genius
with physical comedy.

20:53.886 --> 20:57.456
I know. I've watched
you stuff a turkey.

20:57.456 --> 20:59.058
I guess I have your
sister to thank

20:59.058 --> 21:00.192
for introducing us.

21:00.192 --> 21:01.260
Oh, speaking of Zelda

21:01.260 --> 21:02.962
she's pretty upset
that she blew it

21:02.962 --> 21:04.430
in that meeting
the other day.

21:04.430 --> 21:06.065
She's holding herself
responsible

21:06.065 --> 21:08.534
for the science department
not getting any funding.

21:08.534 --> 21:09.935
Of course they're
getting funding.

21:09.935 --> 21:11.704
All the departments are.

21:11.704 --> 21:14.340
But if your sister tries
any more of her comedy

21:14.340 --> 21:16.408
I may just change my mind.

21:16.575 --> 21:17.977
( <i>chuckles</i> )

21:17.977 --> 21:20.679
( <i>blows air</i> )

21:24.850 --> 21:26.185
Zelda, I had no idea.

21:26.185 --> 21:27.887
You really are funny.
