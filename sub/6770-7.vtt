WEBVTT

00:05.471 --> 00:06.573
(man gasps)

00:06.639 --> 00:07.540
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:07.607 --> 00:08.274
(man groans)

00:08.341 --> 00:10.043
Sir, are you okay?

00:11.678 --> 00:14.147
(grunts)

00:19.252 --> 00:21.521
Kenny...

00:21.588 --> 00:23.089
and Louis.

00:23.156 --> 00:23.456
(crying)

00:23.523 --> 00:25.525
I'm sorry.

00:37.504 --> 00:38.605
-KELLY: Okay.
-STEVE: All right.

00:38.671 --> 00:39.773
What's the big news?

00:39.839 --> 00:41.141
My guess is twins.

00:41.207 --> 00:42.308
Yeah?

00:42.375 --> 00:43.576
Don't even joke.

00:43.643 --> 00:45.378
JANET:
Actually, um,

00:45.445 --> 00:47.313
Steve and I have been thinking
a lot

00:47.380 --> 00:49.482
about who we want
the baby's godparents to be.

00:49.549 --> 00:51.151
STEVE:
We want two people who embody

00:51.217 --> 00:53.820
integrity, honesty, loyalty.

00:53.887 --> 00:56.389
We don't know anyone like that.

00:56.456 --> 00:58.358
We think
that you guys would be great.

00:58.425 --> 00:59.492
You're kidding.

00:59.559 --> 01:02.395
My godmother saved my life
on more than one occasion.

01:02.462 --> 01:03.363
No pressure.

01:03.430 --> 01:05.298
JANET:
My Aunt Lynn.

01:05.364 --> 01:07.534
There was just so many times
that it was easier

01:07.600 --> 01:10.203
to go to her with my problems
than to my parents,

01:10.270 --> 01:11.104
and she really made
a big difference.

01:11.171 --> 01:13.373
We want someone like that
for our kid.

01:13.440 --> 01:15.442
Oh, this is an... honor.

01:15.508 --> 01:16.342
STEVE:
And it's a lot to ask.

01:16.409 --> 01:17.143
I know.

01:17.210 --> 01:18.378
Which is why we want you
to come up

01:18.445 --> 01:21.481
to Ojai with us tomorrow and,
um, just hear more about it.

01:21.548 --> 01:23.416
STEVE: Yeah, we're gonna talk
to Janet's pastor

01:23.483 --> 01:24.717
about the wedding ceremony,
and we figured

01:24.784 --> 01:26.586
the four of us could ride up
together.

01:26.653 --> 01:28.822
Little country air.

01:28.888 --> 01:30.423
Some spiritual guidance.

01:30.490 --> 01:31.658
We sound like freaks, don't we?

01:31.724 --> 01:32.692
(Janet and Steve laugh)

01:32.759 --> 01:34.294
Well, I promise we won't try

01:34.360 --> 01:35.795
and sell you any generic
cleaning products.

01:35.862 --> 01:37.864
-No. It-It sounds great.
-JANET: Oh.

01:37.931 --> 01:39.833
And the best part is,
we get to, uh, try out

01:39.899 --> 01:42.202
the new Sosna-Sanders
minivan.

01:42.268 --> 01:43.837
Excuse me, minivan? You?

01:43.903 --> 01:45.705
STEVE:
Yeah. Yeah.

01:45.772 --> 01:46.706
And I'm okay with it.

01:46.773 --> 01:48.141
Chipper even.

01:48.208 --> 01:49.843
-(Steve laughs)
-Oh, chipper even.

01:49.909 --> 01:52.145
Yeah. Chipper.

01:52.212 --> 01:55.582
So, listen, if I hear anything,
I'll have Gina page you, okay?

01:55.648 --> 01:56.749
Somebody writes me a letter,

01:56.816 --> 01:57.550
it doesn't sit on my desk
for a week.

01:57.617 --> 01:59.586
Well, the governor
is a busy man.

01:59.652 --> 02:01.855
My brother's got 36 hours
to live.

02:01.921 --> 02:04.390
Listen, within that time,
our appeal will be heard.

02:04.457 --> 02:05.825
Okay? I can promise you that.

02:10.530 --> 02:12.298
Do we have any chance at all?

02:12.365 --> 02:14.267
Yeah. Yeah,
I think we're in, uh...

02:14.334 --> 02:16.603
I think we're in good shape.

02:16.669 --> 02:18.671
Thanks for what you're doing.

02:20.940 --> 02:23.209
-Somehow...
-Excuse me.

02:24.244 --> 02:25.478
Hi.

02:25.545 --> 02:27.847
Hi. I didn't know
you were gonna be

02:27.914 --> 02:29.382
down here this morning.

02:29.449 --> 02:31.751
Listen, just because
we agreed not to see each other

02:31.818 --> 02:33.853
doesn't mean
we can't be cordial if we do.

02:33.920 --> 02:35.855
Right.
(chuckles) Okay.

02:35.922 --> 02:38.391
So, Steve and Janet just
asked me to be a godmother.

02:38.458 --> 02:39.559
What do you think?

02:39.626 --> 02:41.661
It's-It's good.

02:41.728 --> 02:43.329
Good. (laughs)

02:43.396 --> 02:45.865
Good. Thank you for that input.

02:45.932 --> 02:47.834
Well, why don't you ask me
in 36 hours

02:47.901 --> 02:49.302
when Pete Hawkins is dead.

02:49.369 --> 02:52.639
Maybe I'll be
a little bit more... cordial.

02:52.705 --> 02:55.575
We decided not to talk
about the case until it's over.

02:55.642 --> 02:57.577
I don't think
we should go there.

02:57.644 --> 02:59.679
See, I forgot. I'm trying
to save somebody's life,

02:59.746 --> 03:01.881
and we've decided
that small talk's a good idea.

03:01.948 --> 03:04.183
Small talk? I just asked
for your opinion, that's all.

03:04.250 --> 03:05.885
You want my opinion?

03:05.952 --> 03:07.687
I think being a godmother
requires compassion.

03:07.754 --> 03:11.324
Lately, I don't think
you've got much.

all those stages.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.043
You know, grief, mourning...

05:10.109 --> 05:11.711
Denial?

05:11.778 --> 05:13.379
(sighs)
Yeah, denial.

05:13.446 --> 05:15.748
Sort of like denying
some of the, uh...

05:15.815 --> 05:16.783
(clears throat)

05:16.849 --> 05:18.785
...NC-17 elements of my life,

05:18.851 --> 05:20.920
when you chose me
to be the godfather?

05:20.987 --> 05:23.856
Guns? Drugs?

05:23.923 --> 05:25.058
Yeah.

05:25.124 --> 05:26.859
Trust me, your fallibilities
were duly noted.

05:26.926 --> 05:28.594
Especially by me.

05:28.661 --> 05:30.963
Oh, so, uh... so this was all
Janet's idea?

05:31.030 --> 05:32.832
She thinks you're dependable.

05:32.899 --> 05:34.934
What do you think?

05:35.001 --> 05:36.636
Look, I want you
to be the godfather.

05:36.703 --> 05:38.805
I just don't want
to see you screw up.

05:38.871 --> 05:41.974
Steve, you got to check out
the captain's chair, all right?

05:42.041 --> 05:44.744
It's ergonomically designed
to contour to your body.

05:44.811 --> 05:46.913
Great.

05:47.914 --> 05:49.582
(Steve scoffs)

05:49.649 --> 05:50.883
Second thoughts?

05:50.950 --> 05:52.118
Nervous breakdown.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.786
DAVID:
All right.

05:53.853 --> 05:56.456
Okay, Steve, here's the deal.

05:56.522 --> 05:58.925
I talked to my sales manager
about the trade-in.

05:58.991 --> 06:01.761
He's willing to give you
$24,000 for your car.

06:01.828 --> 06:03.362
$24,000?

06:03.429 --> 06:05.031
Low <i> Blue Book</i> is $29,000.

06:05.098 --> 06:07.633
I know, but trust me, we're not
gonna make a dime on this deal.

06:07.700 --> 06:08.701
(laughs)
Look, I expect

06:08.768 --> 06:11.704
to walk out of here
with some cash in my pocket.

06:11.771 --> 06:12.872
This is a Corvette.

06:12.939 --> 06:15.541
True, but-but we sell
family cars.

06:15.608 --> 06:16.909
Now, the Wind Jammer, however,

06:16.976 --> 06:18.745
is an investment
in your family's future.

06:18.811 --> 06:20.980
It's safe, it's reliable.

06:21.047 --> 06:24.484
David, did-did you show him
the dirty diaper compartment?

06:24.550 --> 06:25.752
No, I didn't.

06:25.818 --> 06:28.488
Here. Sign your name,

06:28.554 --> 06:30.156
and as you do,
picture how proud you'll feel

06:30.223 --> 06:31.724
with a half-dozen kids

06:31.791 --> 06:33.993
crammed into the back
of your Wind Jammer,

06:34.060 --> 06:35.962
all screaming,
"Thank you, Daddy!"

06:36.929 --> 06:37.997
Mm.

06:42.835 --> 06:44.170
(pen clicking rapidly)

06:46.239 --> 06:47.673
A few more sessions,

06:47.740 --> 06:49.809
and you might actually
look your age.

06:49.876 --> 06:51.978
How about I pay you
just to go away?

06:52.044 --> 06:53.913
Oh, no, no,
I couldn't live with myself

06:53.980 --> 06:56.816
unless I left you
in perfect physical condition.

06:56.883 --> 06:58.484
Come on, Gina.

06:58.551 --> 06:59.952
Schwarzenegger doesn't pay
his trainer

07:00.019 --> 07:01.554
half what I'm paying you.

07:01.621 --> 07:02.722
Yeah, well, as it should be.

07:02.789 --> 07:03.890
I mean, you're paying a premium

07:03.956 --> 07:04.824
for telling Kelly
about my bulimia.

07:04.891 --> 07:06.826
I was trying to help you
with your problem.

07:06.893 --> 07:08.094
Well, that's very sweet.

07:08.161 --> 07:09.896
Now I'm trying to help you
with your problem.

07:09.962 --> 07:11.764
-By blackmailing me.
-Look,

07:11.831 --> 07:12.999
think about it this way:

07:13.065 --> 07:14.901
it's cheaper than child support.

07:14.967 --> 07:18.070
Going into a strip club
was wrong, I admit it.

07:18.137 --> 07:20.106
Don't you think
I've paid for it by now?

07:20.173 --> 07:23.042
All right, you're lucky
I feel sorry for you.

07:23.109 --> 07:24.577
Just give me my check.

07:24.644 --> 07:25.812
You won't tell Jackie?

07:25.878 --> 07:27.079
I have principles.

07:34.821 --> 07:36.455
Hmm.

07:36.522 --> 07:37.990
Nice bonus.

07:39.025 --> 07:40.660
Guilt becomes you.

07:44.997 --> 07:46.132
(honks horn)

07:49.669 --> 07:50.670
(kicks tire)

07:51.838 --> 07:53.739
Ugh!

07:55.541 --> 07:56.642
I don't like this guy.

07:56.709 --> 07:58.077
What do you mean
you don't like him?

07:58.144 --> 07:59.645
He bugs me!

07:59.712 --> 08:01.180
Steve, you backed out
on the trade-in. You don't want

08:01.247 --> 08:02.949
to make five years worth
of payments on a minivan.

08:03.015 --> 08:05.117
I'll make the payments,
all right?

08:05.184 --> 08:06.819
Big Steve needs a good home.

08:06.886 --> 08:08.955
(David laughs)

08:09.021 --> 08:10.890
Big Steve? (laughs)

08:10.957 --> 08:12.825
I didn't let that car dealer
rip me off,

08:12.892 --> 08:14.026
and I'm certainly not going
to compromise my integrity now.

08:14.093 --> 08:15.261
If this is Big Steve,

08:15.328 --> 08:16.963
what are you, like...
you're Little Steve?

08:17.029 --> 08:18.931
-You're-You're teeny?
-Give me a break, okay?

08:18.998 --> 08:20.099
-You're Mini Steve?
-All right!

08:20.166 --> 08:22.869
I'll give you 28,
not a penny more.

08:22.935 --> 08:24.837
(laughs)

08:24.904 --> 08:26.539
You're good. You're really good.

08:26.606 --> 08:28.040
You noticed, didn't you?

08:29.041 --> 08:30.776
-Noticed what?
-The oil leak.

08:30.843 --> 08:31.711
It's not a big deal.

08:31.777 --> 08:33.645
Most people would have
missed it, though.

08:33.712 --> 08:35.047
Keep a few quarts of 10-40
in the trunk,

08:35.114 --> 08:36.182
and it's not a problem.

08:36.249 --> 08:38.150
I saw it right away.

08:38.217 --> 08:40.119
Of course you did.

08:40.186 --> 08:40.953
-Huh.
-STEVE: Razor sharp.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.154
-What did I tell you?
-He's sharp.

08:42.221 --> 08:43.722
You should be ashamed.

08:43.789 --> 08:44.657
What?!

08:44.724 --> 08:47.560
Next guy--
he probably won't be so sharp.

08:47.627 --> 08:49.795
But? But?

08:49.862 --> 08:51.163
Bu-Bu-But?

08:51.230 --> 08:52.531
Steve, what are you doing?

08:52.598 --> 08:53.766
Guy offered you 28 grand.

08:53.833 --> 08:55.167
That's more
than you were asking for.

08:55.234 --> 08:56.969
Changed my mind.
I'm not gonna sell her.

08:57.036 --> 08:58.871
-Keeping her.
-Her?

08:58.938 --> 09:00.172
Big Steve is a her?

09:00.239 --> 09:01.641
Doesn't make any sense.

09:01.707 --> 09:02.675
Janet is always saying,

09:02.742 --> 09:04.877
marriage is about compromise
and understanding.

09:04.944 --> 09:08.848
Well, this is her chance
to do a little compromising

09:08.915 --> 09:11.183
and a whole lot
of understanding.

09:11.250 --> 09:12.985
(laughing)

09:14.921 --> 09:17.056
Let's go have lunch at The Ivy.

09:17.123 --> 09:18.257
Come on!

09:18.324 --> 09:20.726
I'm kind of busy here.

09:20.793 --> 09:22.795
Oh. Okay.

09:23.863 --> 09:26.565
Then let's go have lunch
at The Ivy tomorrow.

09:26.632 --> 09:27.700
Hmm.

09:27.767 --> 09:30.636
And then I will take you
for a massage at Burke Williams.

09:30.703 --> 09:32.271
-My treat.
-Wow. What's the occasion?

09:32.338 --> 09:34.974
I think you're adorable.

09:35.041 --> 09:35.975
(Gina giggles)

09:36.042 --> 09:37.877
Even if I have to say no?

09:37.944 --> 09:39.612
Depends on the reason.

09:39.679 --> 09:43.849
Well, Steve and Janet asked me
to be godparent to their baby,

09:43.916 --> 09:46.686
and we have to go to Ojai,
so I can meet the pastor,

09:46.752 --> 09:49.322
and he can tell me how to do
whatever it is that you do.

09:49.388 --> 09:50.990
Oh, my God.
I think that's great!

09:51.057 --> 09:52.358
-Really?
-Yeah. That's so great.

09:52.425 --> 09:53.526
Well, I wasn't so sure at first.

09:53.592 --> 09:56.262
Well, I think that they made
a very intelligent choice.

09:56.329 --> 09:58.230
Yeah, they did. They asked Kelly
to be godmother.

09:58.297 --> 10:01.233
-So...
-Right.

10:01.300 --> 10:02.601
So that means
she'll be going, too.

10:02.668 --> 10:03.736
Yeah.

10:03.803 --> 10:05.271
Well, that will be really...
special.

10:05.338 --> 10:06.305
I know how it looks.

10:06.372 --> 10:08.708
Please don't get weird on me
about this, Gina.

10:08.774 --> 10:10.176
Let me ask you something.

10:10.242 --> 10:13.346
Why is that every single road
leads back to you and Kelly?

10:13.412 --> 10:15.047
I mean, what are you guys
gonna do?

10:15.114 --> 10:16.148
You're gonna play mommy
and daddy now?

10:16.215 --> 10:19.285
Mm-hmm, and a second ago,
I was an excellent choice.

10:19.352 --> 10:21.053
Good-bye, Dylan.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.655
Gina, I thought
we were past this.

10:22.722 --> 10:24.357
Obviously we're not, so what...

10:24.423 --> 10:25.858
What can I do
to make you feel better?

10:25.925 --> 10:26.926
-Say no.
-To the trip?

10:26.993 --> 10:30.062
Yeah, say no to this whole
surrogate coupling trip.

10:30.129 --> 10:32.064
The whole godparenting thing.
Just say no.

10:32.131 --> 10:33.666
(sighs)

10:33.733 --> 10:37.136
I am going to support
my friends, nothing more.

10:37.203 --> 10:39.205
Well, that's very sweet.

10:44.076 --> 10:46.112
(sighs)

10:48.047 --> 10:49.348
Hey.

10:49.415 --> 10:50.950
Hi.

10:51.017 --> 10:52.318
You going home?

10:52.385 --> 10:55.421
Uh, yeah, I have a lot of stuff
to do at home tonight.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.757
Okay. What kind of stuff?

10:57.823 --> 10:59.825
I don't know. Just... stuff.

10:59.892 --> 11:02.395
Okay, I've got a better idea.
Let's go to a movie.

11:02.461 --> 11:03.963
Noah...

11:06.365 --> 11:07.533
Why are you doing this?

11:07.600 --> 11:10.136
The last I checked, we were
moving in together, remember?

11:10.202 --> 11:12.371
Well...

11:12.438 --> 11:14.840
Well, that was before you got me
arrested as a prostitute.

11:14.907 --> 11:16.008
So we're not moving in
together?

11:16.075 --> 11:18.077
I don't know what <i> we're</i> doing,

11:18.144 --> 11:19.745
but I'm leaving right now.

11:24.750 --> 11:26.018
(indistinct radio communication)

11:26.085 --> 11:28.354
Let's talk about it.

11:33.192 --> 11:34.927
-What happened?
-Guy's dead.

11:34.994 --> 11:36.362
A merchant called.

11:36.429 --> 11:37.897
Coroner's on his way.

11:39.265 --> 11:40.933
I know that guy.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.168
What?

11:42.234 --> 11:44.170
I ran into him earlier.

11:44.236 --> 11:48.040
He needed help,
but I turned away from him.

12:03.889 --> 12:06.325
There was nothing
you could have done.

12:06.392 --> 12:09.895
I could have given him
food or water or something.

12:09.962 --> 12:12.965
There's no way you could have
kept that from happening.

12:13.032 --> 12:14.733
All he said was Kenny and Louis?

12:14.800 --> 12:16.936
That he wanted them
to know he was sorry.

12:17.002 --> 12:19.171
Sweetie, you have to stop
obsessing about this, okay?

12:19.238 --> 12:20.906
He passed out in our gate.

12:20.973 --> 12:23.409
It could have just as easily
been someone else's gate.

12:23.476 --> 12:25.010
But it wasn't.

12:25.077 --> 12:26.278
And I can't help feeling

12:26.345 --> 12:29.815
that maybe there's
a reason for that.

12:31.350 --> 12:33.786
We really should go,

12:33.853 --> 12:35.254
because Dylan and Steve
are waiting for us.

12:35.321 --> 12:37.056
We'll be back this afternoon.

12:37.123 --> 12:39.058
You get some sleep, okay?

12:39.125 --> 12:42.528
-Let me carry this.
-Oh, thank you.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.029
She's right.

12:44.096 --> 12:45.498
You need some sleep.

12:45.564 --> 12:47.466
I can't.

12:49.835 --> 12:52.905
Look, I know there's
no logical reason

12:52.972 --> 12:54.306
why I should feel this way

12:54.373 --> 12:57.877
about a man I knew
nothing about, but...

12:57.943 --> 13:00.546
I just have this feeling.
Does that sound crazy?

13:00.613 --> 13:02.214
No, it doesn't sound crazy.

13:02.281 --> 13:04.350
Thanks.

13:05.951 --> 13:08.420
Because I need
to find out more.

13:08.487 --> 13:11.857
I need to find out who he was,

13:11.924 --> 13:15.127
and why I might have been
the last person he ever saw.

13:15.194 --> 13:17.029
Okay, that's fine.

13:17.096 --> 13:17.963
Just let me help you.

13:18.030 --> 13:20.065
Okay.

13:31.911 --> 13:33.445
You know, don't you?

13:33.512 --> 13:35.047
Know what?

13:35.114 --> 13:37.983
About Dylan and Kelly
being godparents.

13:38.050 --> 13:39.818
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah, so?

13:39.885 --> 13:41.120
I think it sounds nice.

13:41.187 --> 13:42.888
What do you mean
it sounds nice?

13:42.955 --> 13:44.924
Kelly's an ice queen, and
Dylan's idea of responsibility

13:44.990 --> 13:46.225
is making sure
his surfboard is waxed.

13:46.292 --> 13:47.526
Can I come in?

13:47.593 --> 13:49.361
No, not if you're going
to bitch about Dylan.

13:49.428 --> 13:50.930
Well, I'm not going to bitch
about Dylan.

13:50.996 --> 13:53.032
I'm going to bitch about Kelly.
You got a couple hours?

13:53.098 --> 13:54.900
You heard my show
in the last three months?

13:54.967 --> 13:57.436
Yeah, I know, David,
you're angry. So am I.

13:57.503 --> 14:00.072
You know, it's amazing, though,
I've actually figured out

14:00.139 --> 14:02.441
how to put up boundaries.

14:02.508 --> 14:04.043
That's great, David.

14:04.109 --> 14:05.611
You know, I'm-- I'm just...

14:05.678 --> 14:07.479
I'm freaking out.

14:09.515 --> 14:11.450
I'm crazy about you,

14:11.517 --> 14:14.853
but I can look you in the eye
and say that if you came here

14:14.920 --> 14:16.922
to talk about him,
I don't want you here.

14:16.989 --> 14:21.093
It's really nice weather we've
been having lately, huh?

14:22.595 --> 14:23.996
(sighs)

14:26.999 --> 14:30.903
I'm really sorry I can't
help you out with Dylan.

14:30.970 --> 14:32.972
No, don't worry about it.

14:33.038 --> 14:35.374
Can we just sit here
for awhile together?

14:35.441 --> 14:37.876
Yeah, that would be nice.

14:45.117 --> 14:46.418
You may kiss the bride.

14:46.485 --> 14:47.920
That's my favorite part.

14:50.256 --> 14:52.625
Then I'll pronounce you
man and wife.

14:52.691 --> 14:55.494
And it really won't be much more
complicated than that

14:55.561 --> 14:58.397
unless you decide to ride up
on an elephant or something.

14:58.464 --> 15:00.499
Oh, I won't need to ride up
on an elephant.

15:00.566 --> 15:02.067
I am an elephant.

15:02.134 --> 15:04.136
Quit it. You are going to be
a beautiful bride.

15:04.203 --> 15:05.537
You know, I personally think

15:05.604 --> 15:09.275
that the marriage-birth
combo platter is the way to go.

15:09.341 --> 15:11.510
These are important events
for you two as well.

15:11.577 --> 15:14.513
Being a godparent, uh,
certainly feels important.

15:14.580 --> 15:17.182
Yeah, and if someone would
explain to us what it means,

15:17.249 --> 15:19.018
we might actually
take it seriously.

15:19.084 --> 15:21.987
And you said he'd only
send Junior checks.

15:22.054 --> 15:23.989
I-- I didn't say that.

15:24.056 --> 15:25.057
I said that you would

15:25.124 --> 15:27.359
send checks with
lots of zeros.

15:27.426 --> 15:29.528
KELLY:
My problem is I just don't know

15:29.595 --> 15:31.196
that I'm going to be
any good at it.

15:31.263 --> 15:33.532
Well, Kelly, in asking
you and Dylan to do this,

15:33.599 --> 15:36.635
Steve and Janet have
started to build

15:36.702 --> 15:39.138
a spiritual support system
for their family, that's all.

15:39.204 --> 15:42.107
There's no roll call, no dues,
no weekly meetings.

15:42.174 --> 15:45.611
We just like the idea
that you're going to be there.

15:45.678 --> 15:47.446
That's nice. Thank you.

15:47.513 --> 15:49.014
You we tolerate.

15:49.081 --> 15:50.649
Eh...

15:50.716 --> 15:55.220
In their child's eyes, you and
Dylan will be linked for life.

16:03.262 --> 16:04.330
MAN:
Okay to park here?

16:04.396 --> 16:05.531
WOMAN:
Yes.

16:08.734 --> 16:11.070
I am so bummed.

16:11.136 --> 16:13.272
Excuse me?

16:13.339 --> 16:15.140
The for sale sign--

16:15.207 --> 16:17.409
it was in the window
when I drove by yesterday.

16:17.476 --> 16:19.378
Do you know if this
has been sold?

16:19.445 --> 16:21.347
You want to buy it?

16:21.413 --> 16:24.183
5.7 liter, eight cylinders,

16:24.249 --> 16:26.051
zero to 60 in
under five seconds--

16:26.118 --> 16:27.353
are you kidding me?

16:27.419 --> 16:28.354
Love this car.

16:28.420 --> 16:30.022
Well, it's not sold yet.

16:30.089 --> 16:32.991
A buddy of mine just changed
his mind about letting it go.

16:33.058 --> 16:34.526
Wait a minute--
you're David Silver.

16:34.593 --> 16:36.061
Yes, I am.

16:37.830 --> 16:43.068
"If you're going to play,
you might as well score," right?

16:43.135 --> 16:44.670
(chuckles)

16:44.737 --> 16:46.605
It's a slogan.

16:46.672 --> 16:48.006
It gets ratings.

16:48.073 --> 16:49.775
I love it.

16:49.842 --> 16:50.776
Yeah?

16:50.843 --> 16:51.877
Yeah, I think most women do,

16:51.944 --> 16:54.246
but they're too scared to say
what they really want.

16:54.313 --> 16:55.447
And you're not?

16:55.514 --> 16:57.082
Not at all.

16:57.149 --> 16:59.718
So how much was he asking,
anyway?

16:59.785 --> 17:02.354
I'm sor... Who?

17:02.421 --> 17:04.423
Your buddy, for the car?

17:04.490 --> 17:08.794
Right. Uh, $27,000.

17:08.861 --> 17:09.994
If I offered $28,000,

17:10.061 --> 17:12.464
you think there's anything
you could do to change his mind?

17:19.438 --> 17:22.641
(phone ringing)

17:26.111 --> 17:27.311
Hello.

17:27.378 --> 17:28.680
Janet, hey, it's David.

17:28.747 --> 17:30.649
I'm sorry, I thought this
was Steve's phone.

17:30.716 --> 17:32.451
Oh, what's up? We're just
finishing up with the pastor.

17:32.518 --> 17:33.652
Quick question--

17:33.719 --> 17:34.720
you sure you won't
reconsider selling?

17:34.787 --> 17:36.288
Selling what?

17:36.355 --> 17:37.389
The car.

17:37.456 --> 17:38.357
What are you talking about?

17:38.424 --> 17:39.358
Of course we're selling the car.

17:39.425 --> 17:41.260
All right, never mind.

17:41.326 --> 17:42.828
Wait.

17:42.895 --> 17:45.364
Did Steve tell you that
he wasn't letting it go?

17:45.431 --> 17:47.099
Let me guess-- he never had
a conversation with you

17:47.166 --> 17:49.134
about compromise
and understanding.

17:49.201 --> 17:51.770
-No, he hasn't.
-Well, he's about to.

17:51.837 --> 17:55.340
No, he's about to talk with me
about lying and deception.

17:55.407 --> 17:56.475
Suppose it would be impossible

17:56.542 --> 17:57.843
to forget we had
this conversation?

17:57.910 --> 18:01.413
-Sell the damn car.
-Right.

18:04.349 --> 18:06.819
Good news.

18:06.885 --> 18:10.589
-Let's celebrate.
-Let's.

18:12.157 --> 18:14.326
He had no I.D. and we checked
his fingerprints.

18:14.393 --> 18:15.861
But we came up with nothing.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.663
How is that possible?

18:17.729 --> 18:19.298
Well, unless you have
a criminal record,

18:19.364 --> 18:20.466
there's nothing we
can cross-check.

18:20.532 --> 18:22.134
This guy's not a crook.

18:22.201 --> 18:23.869
He just slipped through
the cracks of society

18:23.936 --> 18:25.704
like a lot of others.

18:25.771 --> 18:27.806
We'll treat him like a John Doe.

18:27.873 --> 18:29.808
-So what happens now?
-Oh, he'll be cremated.

18:29.875 --> 18:32.811
We'll store his ashes
in a county facility

18:32.878 --> 18:34.746
for around ten years,

18:34.813 --> 18:37.382
just in case a loved one
starts looking for him.

18:37.449 --> 18:38.417
Then what?

18:38.484 --> 18:41.553
Then we'll dispose of his ashes.

18:41.620 --> 18:44.790
How could someone be
so anonymous?

18:44.857 --> 18:45.691
Well, I didn't say anonymous.

18:45.757 --> 18:47.893
It's just that the county
doesn't have

18:47.960 --> 18:49.828
the time or the money to conduct
a full investigation.

18:49.895 --> 18:51.597
So that's it,
that's the end of the story?

18:51.663 --> 18:53.131
Well, if there's
more to the story,

18:53.198 --> 18:54.900
then you're going to have
to find out yourself.

18:54.967 --> 18:55.734
This is all he had.

18:55.801 --> 18:58.704
-See you.
-Thanks.

19:00.706 --> 19:02.808
I got it.

19:06.845 --> 19:09.915
God, look how much he's changed.

19:14.253 --> 19:16.788
KELLY:
I thought Pastor Neal was great.

19:16.855 --> 19:19.791
Your basic man of the cloth.

19:19.858 --> 19:22.394
He and I have different ideas
on how the world works.

19:22.461 --> 19:24.696
What do you mean
different ideas?

19:24.763 --> 19:26.431
Well, call me cynical,

19:26.498 --> 19:29.234
but I think his point of view
is a little...

19:29.301 --> 19:30.936
Romantic?

19:31.003 --> 19:33.605
Not what I was going to say,
but you get the idea.

19:33.672 --> 19:34.506
Yeah.

19:34.573 --> 19:36.508
I like what he said
about us, though.

19:36.575 --> 19:38.477
What did he say?

19:38.544 --> 19:40.512
That we'd be linked
for life.

19:40.579 --> 19:42.681
Oh, that.

19:42.748 --> 19:44.750
Yeah, that.

19:44.816 --> 19:46.818
Hey, did you ever see
the Pink Moment?

19:46.885 --> 19:49.388
What is that?
That sounds obscene.

19:49.454 --> 19:51.657
It's what they call
the sunset up here.

19:51.723 --> 19:55.627
Oh, good, 'cause you were
making me nervous.

19:55.694 --> 19:58.830
It has something to do
with the light and the clouds.

19:58.897 --> 20:00.799
And there's a scientific
explanation

20:00.866 --> 20:02.668
about the light bouncing off,

20:02.734 --> 20:03.669
but the bottom line is,

20:03.735 --> 20:05.771
everything glows pink
for about two minutes.

20:05.837 --> 20:07.306
It's neat.

20:07.372 --> 20:08.807
That sounds amazing.

20:08.874 --> 20:10.309
Have you ever seen it?

20:10.375 --> 20:13.278
Yeah,
back when I was less cynical.

20:13.345 --> 20:15.314
You know what,
maybe you're not cynical.

20:15.380 --> 20:17.583
Maybe you're just unhappy.

20:17.649 --> 20:19.918
Yeah, maybe both.

20:19.985 --> 20:21.653
You all right?

20:21.720 --> 20:23.989
I'm okay.

20:27.292 --> 20:29.795
Hey, I'm sorry
we dragged you guys

20:29.861 --> 20:31.530
all the way up here,
but we're leaving.

20:31.597 --> 20:34.333
-What? What's going on?
-Oh, Steve's cheating on me.

20:34.399 --> 20:35.534
With his car.

20:36.568 --> 20:37.869
She sold my car.

20:37.936 --> 20:39.905
It's not even hers to sell,
and she sells my car!

20:39.972 --> 20:41.873
He cried when I told him,
I swear to God.

20:41.940 --> 20:43.308
Oh, please!

20:43.375 --> 20:45.844
You know this sounds stupid,
don't you?

20:45.911 --> 20:48.847
After all you guys have been
through in the last few months,

20:48.914 --> 20:50.248
you're fighting over a car?

20:50.315 --> 20:51.750
It's not just a car.

20:51.817 --> 20:53.785
It's a way of life for me, okay?

20:53.852 --> 20:54.953
Honestly, couldn't you just gag?

20:55.020 --> 20:57.356
Uh, I'll tell you what--

20:57.422 --> 20:59.758
you two lovebirds, why don't
you just go on by yourself

20:59.825 --> 21:02.928
and Kelly and I, we'll rent
a car and come back later.

21:02.995 --> 21:05.631
Yeah, we're gonna stay,
check out the sunset.

21:05.697 --> 21:07.366
Are you sure?
'Cause there's plenty of room.

21:07.432 --> 21:09.034
Oh, yeah.

21:19.845 --> 21:21.713
DAVID: <i> I'm really</i>
<i>just telling my listeners</i>

21:21.780 --> 21:23.682
the stuff I wish
someone would have told me.

21:23.749 --> 21:26.652
Don't let people walk
all over you, you know?

21:26.718 --> 21:27.919
Be strong. Love yourself.

21:27.986 --> 21:29.421
No wonder it resonates.

21:29.488 --> 21:31.056
That's the theme of my work.

21:31.123 --> 21:32.891
-Really? What do you do?
-I'm an artist.

21:32.958 --> 21:34.026
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

21:34.092 --> 21:35.027
I'm surprised.

21:35.093 --> 21:37.362
Judging me by how I look?

21:37.429 --> 21:38.497
(chuckles)

21:38.563 --> 21:39.665
If I didn't objectify women,

21:39.731 --> 21:41.366
what kind of a chauvinist
would I be?

21:41.433 --> 21:42.834
Mm-hmm.

21:42.901 --> 21:45.771
I'm a performance artist,

21:45.837 --> 21:48.774
so, in a way,
my body is a part of my work.

21:48.840 --> 21:49.908
You don't say.

21:49.975 --> 21:51.910
I'd love to show it to you
sometime.

21:52.978 --> 21:54.546
My work, that is.

21:54.613 --> 21:55.814
Or whatever.

21:55.881 --> 21:59.418
Well, guess the only question
is when?

21:59.484 --> 22:02.587
I can't tonight,
but how about tomorrow?

22:02.654 --> 22:03.989
Tomorrow it is.

22:04.856 --> 22:07.726
I got it. I happen to believe

22:07.793 --> 22:09.461
the guy should pick up
the check.

22:18.770 --> 22:20.939
(over recorder): I happen to
believe the guy

22:21.006 --> 22:22.808
should pick up the check.

22:34.953 --> 22:40.592
Uh, can I get you some coffee
or water or something?

22:40.659 --> 22:43.962
I want to throw this away
so much...

22:44.029 --> 22:46.465
or break it. Something.

22:48.200 --> 22:51.737
2:45.

22:51.803 --> 22:54.406
Pete's got less than ten hours.

22:57.843 --> 22:59.010
There you go.

23:00.979 --> 23:02.848
-(phone rings)
-Matt Durning.

23:02.914 --> 23:04.015
KELLY:
Hey, Matt.

23:04.082 --> 23:06.852
Oh, hi.

23:06.918 --> 23:07.919
It's Kelly.

23:09.454 --> 23:11.123
Did you hear anything?

23:11.189 --> 23:12.858
Uh, no, not yet.

23:12.924 --> 23:17.596
Um... well, I should probably
keep the line open.

23:17.662 --> 23:21.800
Listen, Matt, you and I have
said some pretty harsh things

23:21.867 --> 23:22.968
to each other lately,

23:23.034 --> 23:26.104
and I just feel like I need
to clear my head a little,

23:26.171 --> 23:27.806
so I'm gonna stay up here
tonight.

23:27.873 --> 23:30.509
All right.
Well, thanks for telling me.

23:30.575 --> 23:31.710
I would've worried.

23:31.777 --> 23:33.845
Yeah, uh, Steve and Janet had
a silly fight,

23:33.912 --> 23:34.880
and they already headed back.

23:34.946 --> 23:37.582
So, Dylan and I will come back
in the morning.

23:37.649 --> 23:38.650
You and Dylan?

23:39.684 --> 23:40.852
There's supposed
to be this weird,

23:40.919 --> 23:42.988
um, pink sunset thing
that's supposed

23:43.054 --> 23:44.055
to be worth checking out.

23:44.122 --> 23:45.724
Uh-huh.

23:45.791 --> 23:47.759
We were gonna ride back
with them,

23:47.826 --> 23:51.096
uh, but it would have been
a nightmare.

23:51.163 --> 23:53.732
Uh, Kelly, I-I should really go.

23:53.799 --> 23:56.935
Oh, of course. I'm sorry.

23:58.069 --> 23:58.937
Bye.

24:01.540 --> 24:04.075
(sighs)
Da-da-da-da-da.

24:07.946 --> 24:09.481
Heard you say, "You and Dylan."

24:09.548 --> 24:11.917
Uh, yeah, they're spending
the night in Ojai.

24:11.983 --> 24:13.919
Something about a sunset
or something and...

24:13.985 --> 24:15.086
Yeah, something like Mexico?

24:15.153 --> 24:17.656
-Gina...
-What?

24:17.722 --> 24:18.990
-Relax.
-No. You want me to relax

24:19.057 --> 24:20.058
after the last time

24:20.125 --> 24:20.559
those two slipped off
the radar screen together?

24:20.625 --> 24:21.993
I don't think so.

24:22.060 --> 24:23.061
Where are you going?

24:23.128 --> 24:25.997
I'm going to watch

24:26.064 --> 24:28.033
the sunset in Ojai.

24:51.156 --> 24:52.524
NOAH:
Rum Cellar.

24:52.591 --> 24:54.926
It's gotta be the place. Here.

24:56.094 --> 24:56.828
Oh, excuse me.

24:56.895 --> 24:58.730
Um, excuse me.
Can I ask you...?

24:58.797 --> 25:00.065
-Excuse... Excuse me.
-Mm-hmm?

25:00.131 --> 25:02.000
-Can I ask you a question?
-Mm-hmm.

25:02.067 --> 25:03.068
Um, do you know this man?

25:03.134 --> 25:06.771
Um, he had this matchbook
from this bar on him.

25:06.838 --> 25:08.573
That's Willard Reiner.
I know him real good.

25:08.640 --> 25:10.542
Good. We're trying to find
someone that knew this guy.

25:10.609 --> 25:13.111
He, um, died yesterday.

25:13.178 --> 25:14.512
He did?

25:14.579 --> 25:16.081
Yeah, I'm really sorry.

25:16.147 --> 25:17.549
Um, anyway, like we said,

25:17.616 --> 25:19.017
we're trying to find people
who knew him.

25:19.084 --> 25:20.886
Hopefully, arrange a memorial
service for him.

25:20.952 --> 25:22.654
So you two didn't know him?

25:22.721 --> 25:24.089
No, not really.

25:24.155 --> 25:25.724
Actually, we bumped into each
other yesterday,

25:25.790 --> 25:28.126
but he just, he had a real
sweetness in his eye.

25:28.193 --> 25:29.995
I thought his friends might want
to know what happened.

25:30.061 --> 25:32.197
Well, you know, they might,
if he had any friends.

25:32.264 --> 25:33.999
(scoffs) What are you
talking about?

25:34.065 --> 25:35.300
This guy was a thief.

25:35.367 --> 25:36.735
He stole, he swindled,

25:36.801 --> 25:38.837
he borrowed from everybody
inside that bar.

25:38.904 --> 25:40.839
On top of that,
he left his family.

25:40.906 --> 25:42.240
I don't know anybody...

25:42.307 --> 25:43.875
about any kind of sweetness
at all

25:43.942 --> 25:45.744
but I guarantee when I go back
in there

25:45.810 --> 25:47.112
and announce
that Willard's dead,

25:47.178 --> 25:50.015
I won't have to pay for a drink
the rest of the night.

25:50.081 --> 25:51.049
(laughs)

25:53.184 --> 25:54.319
(door shuts)

25:54.386 --> 25:56.721
Whew.

26:03.228 --> 26:05.730
Ah, I thought you were leaving.

26:05.797 --> 26:10.035
Kelly and I thought we might
stick around, see the sunset.

26:10.101 --> 26:12.037
Pink Moment.

26:12.103 --> 26:17.008
Looks like you've got about
an hour and a half.

26:17.075 --> 26:21.046
Um, could I, could I talk
to you for a second?

26:21.112 --> 26:22.614
I'd like that.

26:22.681 --> 26:25.083
I don't really know how

26:25.150 --> 26:26.351
you're supposed
to start one of these.

26:26.418 --> 26:28.887
You say whatever's on your mind.

26:28.954 --> 26:33.325
My wife, she died
four years ago,

26:33.391 --> 26:35.727
and the last time I was here
was with her.

26:35.794 --> 26:39.097
You saw the sunset?

26:39.164 --> 26:44.069
Yeah, we, uh, we hiked up
to Shelf Road, you know?

26:44.135 --> 26:45.904
Nothing fancy.
We just took a blanket.

26:45.971 --> 26:48.139
She, uh, she picked
some oranges.

26:50.208 --> 26:52.811
That was the last time that
I really remember ever thinking

26:52.877 --> 26:56.081
about any of the things
you spoke about this morning.

26:56.147 --> 26:58.883
Now you're here again
to see the sunset with Kelly,

26:58.950 --> 27:00.952
who obviously loves you
very much.

27:01.019 --> 27:02.721
Is it obvious?

27:02.787 --> 27:06.157
I mean, you seem to think
that Kelly and I are a couple.

27:06.224 --> 27:09.294
Are you worried that your wife
wouldn't want it to be more?

27:09.361 --> 27:11.162
We're just friends.

27:11.229 --> 27:13.264
That's, it's just the way
it's always been.

27:13.331 --> 27:18.136
Although, I have been with other
women since Antonia died.

27:18.203 --> 27:19.170
I, uh...

27:19.237 --> 27:23.141
Truly? With all your heart?

27:23.208 --> 27:27.278
You know, Dylan, maybe you shut
down after Antonia died.

27:27.345 --> 27:30.115
Maybe it's time to start
watching the sunset

27:30.181 --> 27:31.916
with the right person again.

27:42.160 --> 27:43.695
Uh, sorry, Miss, your, uh,

27:43.762 --> 27:45.330
your credit card's been
rejected.

27:45.397 --> 27:46.664
Do you have any cash?

27:46.731 --> 27:49.367
Uh... yeah, just...

27:49.434 --> 27:50.235
You know what?

27:50.301 --> 27:52.203
I probably just used it
too much today.

27:54.105 --> 27:56.241
Here. Could you hurry?

28:00.945 --> 28:03.248
(dialing tones)

28:04.916 --> 28:06.751
(sighs)

28:06.818 --> 28:09.888
Hi, is Mel Silver there?
It's Gina Kincaid calling.

28:09.954 --> 28:11.890
Yeah, well, tell him
it's Gina Kincaid calling,

28:11.956 --> 28:13.892
and he'll become available.

28:13.958 --> 28:17.095
WOMAN (over P.A.): Dr. Silver,
Gina Kincaid on line two.

28:17.162 --> 28:18.263
Excuse me.

28:23.935 --> 28:25.103
What do you want?

28:25.170 --> 28:26.704
Hey! Melly, what's going on?

28:26.771 --> 28:28.840
Listen, I called to set up
a session for tomorrow.

28:28.907 --> 28:30.108
Um, I think that I'll be
available...

28:30.175 --> 28:32.811
We're through, remember?

28:32.877 --> 28:34.079
Yeah, right.

28:34.145 --> 28:38.216
I wonder what Jackie is gonna
say when I call her and tell her

28:38.283 --> 28:39.317
that you offered that girl

28:39.384 --> 28:42.253
a hundred dollars to go into
the back room with you.

28:42.320 --> 28:43.121
You're sick.

28:43.188 --> 28:44.856
Yeah, whatever.
Listen, about tomorrow,

28:44.923 --> 28:46.257
I think I can be available

28:46.324 --> 28:48.493
at, like, about...

28:48.560 --> 28:50.395
Hello?

28:50.462 --> 28:51.830
Hello?!

28:51.896 --> 28:52.864
(man clears throat)

28:52.931 --> 28:53.898
Here's your change.

28:53.965 --> 28:54.966
GINA:
Uh!

28:55.033 --> 28:56.334
-22 cents.
-Yeah, thanks.

28:56.401 --> 28:57.802
Sorry about the pennies.

29:03.341 --> 29:05.276
NOAH: <i> So, what,</i>
<i>you're just gonna give up?</i>

29:05.343 --> 29:08.313
I never should have started.

29:08.379 --> 29:10.181
Ah, I-I know
you don't believe that.

29:10.248 --> 29:11.249
Yeah, I do.

29:11.316 --> 29:13.885
Just because a guy dies 50 feet
away from my store

29:13.952 --> 29:16.187
does not mean I have to make him
my life's work.

29:16.254 --> 29:19.124
(scoffs) One guy said
he was a jerk, okay?

29:19.190 --> 29:20.058
One guy.

29:20.125 --> 29:23.161
And I built him up
to be this great guy.

29:23.228 --> 29:25.897
Yeah, I mean, you built him up,
and then you tear him back down.

29:25.964 --> 29:28.500
Mm-hmm. It's called
being disillusioned.

29:28.566 --> 29:30.068
By somebody you don't even know.

29:30.135 --> 29:31.769
Unless you're trying
to make me feel worse here,

29:31.836 --> 29:32.837
this isn't helping.

29:32.904 --> 29:34.105
Listen to me, okay?

29:34.172 --> 29:35.874
You take these people

29:35.940 --> 29:37.308
and you build them up
to these heights.

29:37.375 --> 29:39.043
You give them these glorious
attributes,

29:39.110 --> 29:41.312
and-and hold 'em to standards
they just can't maintain.

29:41.379 --> 29:43.047
They can't.

29:43.114 --> 29:45.350
Then you get disappointed,
and you walk away.

29:45.416 --> 29:47.552
I don't think I expect too much.

29:47.619 --> 29:51.055
Sometimes, I think you expect
the world.

29:51.122 --> 29:53.291
I really do.

30:06.237 --> 30:07.438
(tires screech)

30:07.505 --> 30:08.439
Excuse me, sir.

30:08.506 --> 30:10.808
"Sir"? What is it?

30:10.875 --> 30:11.809
You got the time?

30:11.876 --> 30:12.810
(engine revving)

30:12.877 --> 30:13.878
Yeah, it's 4:30.

30:13.945 --> 30:14.879
What?

30:14.946 --> 30:17.582
(engine revs, tires squeal)

30:18.983 --> 30:20.485
He called me "sir."

30:23.054 --> 30:25.890
What do you remember
about our first date?

30:25.957 --> 30:27.926
I don't know. Why?

30:27.992 --> 30:29.861
You picked me up in
your Corvette,

30:29.928 --> 30:31.863
and I sat really low in the seat

30:31.930 --> 30:33.498
so no one could see me
inside of it.

30:33.565 --> 30:35.567
You said you had
lower back pain.

30:35.633 --> 30:39.337
Yeah. I, uh, I lied.

30:39.404 --> 30:42.840
But I had a lot of fun,
and you were really cute.

30:42.907 --> 30:46.177
And by the drive home,
I sat up straight.

30:46.244 --> 30:47.946
Despite the car.

30:48.012 --> 30:50.615
See, the point is
it wasn't about the car.

30:50.682 --> 30:52.550
It was about the guy
inside the car.

30:52.617 --> 30:57.622
And if that guy wants to drive
a phallic little hot rod,

30:57.689 --> 31:00.358
then, then that's the car
you should drive.

31:00.425 --> 31:02.060
Excuse me. It's not phallic.

31:02.126 --> 31:04.128
It's sleek!

31:04.195 --> 31:05.897
Do you want the car back or not?

31:05.964 --> 31:08.233
Phallic it is.

31:08.299 --> 31:09.100
(horn honks)

31:09.167 --> 31:10.235
(chuckles)
Okay, okay.

31:12.203 --> 31:14.572
(knocking on door)

31:16.608 --> 31:19.110
Hey, sunset's in 32 minutes.

31:19.177 --> 31:22.914
Yeah, they're about to do
a story on Matt's case.

31:22.981 --> 31:24.415
They say what happened yet?

31:24.482 --> 31:25.984
Not yet.

31:26.050 --> 31:29.454
Maybe you ought to call
and get an update.

31:29.520 --> 31:31.189
Yeah, I already tried that.

31:31.256 --> 31:32.390
Didn't go so well.

31:32.457 --> 31:35.260
I think it's better
that I'm here.

31:35.326 --> 31:38.062
I think so, too.

31:38.129 --> 31:40.632
Want to raid the minibar
before we go?

31:40.698 --> 31:45.436
I like your thinking,
but I already scorched mine.

31:45.503 --> 31:47.071
Prepare to dine on
honey-roasted peanuts...

31:47.138 --> 31:48.339
Mm-hmm.

31:48.406 --> 31:50.208
...uh, little bottles of rum

31:50.275 --> 31:51.142
(Kelly chuckles)

31:51.209 --> 31:55.079
and... string cheese.

31:55.146 --> 31:57.081
(Kelly laughs)

31:57.148 --> 31:59.183
This feels good.

31:59.250 --> 32:00.451
What does?

32:00.518 --> 32:03.254
You... me...

32:03.321 --> 32:05.023
little bottles of rum.

32:05.089 --> 32:06.190
Mm.

32:06.257 --> 32:07.425
REPORTER:
A landmark decision

32:07.492 --> 32:09.160
from Sacramento today.

32:09.227 --> 32:11.162
The governor has commuted
the death sentence

32:11.229 --> 32:14.132
of Pete Hawkins
only six hours before

32:14.198 --> 32:16.100
the convicted murderer was set
to be executed.

32:16.167 --> 32:18.036
My God, he did it.

32:18.102 --> 32:19.137
This is a great day.

32:19.203 --> 32:20.138
A great day, indeed.

32:20.204 --> 32:22.440
Not only for the Hawkins family,

32:22.507 --> 32:25.376
but for everyone who believes
the death penalty

32:25.443 --> 32:27.111
to be cruel and unusual
punishment.

32:27.178 --> 32:28.212
Pete Hawkins was convicted...

32:28.279 --> 32:30.615
He saved someone's life.

32:30.682 --> 32:33.284
Somebody you didn't think
was worth saving.

32:33.351 --> 32:36.087
What I think
really doesn't matter now.

32:36.154 --> 32:38.556
What Matt did is amazing.

32:38.623 --> 32:41.025
Yeah, you should call him.

32:41.092 --> 32:44.228
What about the Pink Moment,

32:44.295 --> 32:46.998
all those little bottles of rum?

32:47.065 --> 32:48.633
Yeah, I wouldn't worry
about that.

32:48.700 --> 32:51.069
They have those all the time.

32:51.135 --> 32:53.171
And, well, as for the bottles
of rum,

32:53.237 --> 32:54.605
we both know I can handle that.

32:54.672 --> 32:55.640
Are you sure?

32:55.707 --> 32:57.041
I think you should

32:57.108 --> 32:58.676
come up here
sometime with Matt.

32:58.743 --> 33:00.545
Watch the Pink Moment with him.

33:00.611 --> 33:03.247
Thanks.

33:03.314 --> 33:05.416
Come here.

33:13.491 --> 33:14.726
GINA:
Surprise.

33:14.792 --> 33:17.395
You know, you can actually see
the sunset better

33:17.462 --> 33:19.430
if you go outside.

33:34.078 --> 33:35.213
Hey, David.

33:35.279 --> 33:37.348
Steve! Dude, who is
your friend, huh?

33:37.415 --> 33:39.083
Thanks.

33:39.150 --> 33:39.917
Look at this.

33:39.984 --> 33:41.519
Didn't even take out
a commission.

33:41.586 --> 33:43.688
I want my car back.

33:43.755 --> 33:45.523
Yeah, and a million bucks
in the bank

33:45.590 --> 33:47.258
and a mistress on the side,
right?

33:47.325 --> 33:48.459
Here on planet Earth,

33:48.526 --> 33:50.328
I think you should just take
the 28 grand.

33:50.395 --> 33:52.063
Maybe I didn't make
myself clear.

33:52.130 --> 33:53.231
I'm getting my car back.

33:53.297 --> 33:54.599
Yeah, but I sold it
to Marta.

33:54.665 --> 33:55.867
Marta's got the keys.

33:55.933 --> 33:59.203
Well, then we're going to get
the keys back from Marta, okay?

33:59.270 --> 34:01.172
Why do I get the feeling

34:01.239 --> 34:03.174
that this was more than a
business proposition for you?

34:03.241 --> 34:05.109
You've got no idea.

34:05.176 --> 34:07.712
Okay, so you're using my car to
pick up chicks now, is that it?

34:07.779 --> 34:10.380
-It's not your car, Steve.
-Oh, yes, it is.

34:10.447 --> 34:12.049
I never signed away
the pink slip.

34:12.116 --> 34:13.284
Yeah, you talk to Janet
about this?

34:13.351 --> 34:16.219
'Cause the last time I told her
you were backpedaling there,

34:16.286 --> 34:17.588
she almost castrated me.

34:17.655 --> 34:19.223
Keeping the car was her idea.

34:19.290 --> 34:21.391
Ah, I see.

34:21.458 --> 34:23.327
You begged-- she said okay.

34:23.393 --> 34:25.530
Where is this Marta?

34:25.596 --> 34:28.466
I'm supposed to be meeting her
at 4:00 today at her warehouse.

34:28.533 --> 34:30.701
All right, great.
I'm going to go with you.

34:30.768 --> 34:32.335
No, you're not.
It's a date.

34:32.402 --> 34:33.438
Not anymore.

34:36.407 --> 34:38.576
(sighs)

34:38.643 --> 34:41.478
-Hey.
-Hey.

34:41.545 --> 34:44.282
Noah, this is Wendy Reiner,
Willard's daughter.

34:44.348 --> 34:46.684
-It's very nice to meet you.
-It's very nice to meet you.

34:46.751 --> 34:48.219
Look, I'm sorry
about your father.

34:48.286 --> 34:49.286
You okay?

34:49.353 --> 34:50.755
Yeah. I'm better. Thank you.

34:50.822 --> 34:53.324
You know, if it hadn't been
for the two of you

34:53.391 --> 34:55.226
and running that obituary,

34:55.293 --> 34:57.395
if you hadn't
gone out of your way,

34:57.462 --> 34:58.830
we never would have found him.

35:00.097 --> 35:04.502
My dad wasn't always like the
man that you met a few days ago.

35:04.569 --> 35:07.438
He was a really good man.

35:07.505 --> 35:09.507
He always worked really hard
to make ends meet.

35:09.574 --> 35:11.642
When I was growing up,
he worked two jobs.

35:11.709 --> 35:13.311
He worked the swing shift
in a cannery

35:13.377 --> 35:14.679
and he drove a school bus.

35:14.745 --> 35:16.113
One afternoon,

35:16.180 --> 35:18.483
it was right before
his last stop,

35:18.549 --> 35:22.420
his bus was broadsided
by a drunk driver.

35:22.487 --> 35:24.589
And it landed in a ditch
and two kids died.

35:24.655 --> 35:26.491
Kenny and Louis.

35:26.557 --> 35:27.692
The accident wasn't his fault,

35:27.758 --> 35:29.660
but he blamed himself.

35:29.727 --> 35:31.462
And that's when
he started drinking.

35:31.529 --> 35:33.431
And then, nine years ago,
he left us.

35:33.498 --> 35:36.801
And if it hadn't been
for the two of you,

35:36.868 --> 35:38.603
we would not have
gotten him back.

35:38.669 --> 35:40.271
I had nothing to do with it.

35:40.338 --> 35:42.440
It was, it was all Donna.

35:42.507 --> 35:43.508
She believed in your father,
you know.

35:43.574 --> 35:44.842
Nobody else did.

35:47.411 --> 35:49.380
Thank you.

35:49.447 --> 35:52.149
Well, I'm going to go.

35:52.216 --> 35:54.819
Wendy...

35:54.886 --> 35:58.523
Sorry, I almost forgot.

35:58.589 --> 36:01.792
I thought you might want this.

36:03.427 --> 36:04.695
Thank you.

36:07.298 --> 36:09.934
I have so few memories
of my dad.

36:10.001 --> 36:11.569
This really means a lot to me.

36:13.271 --> 36:15.540
Thank you.

36:18.676 --> 36:20.478
(sighs)

36:22.246 --> 36:22.914
You are amazing.

36:22.980 --> 36:24.649
How did you run the obituary?

36:24.715 --> 36:26.551
Well, I just told the guy
at the <i> Chronicle</i>

36:26.617 --> 36:28.886
that Willard Reiner deserved
more than he was getting.

36:28.953 --> 36:31.589
-So you didn't give up on him.
-Thanks to you.

36:31.656 --> 36:33.958
I realized you were right
about me.

36:34.025 --> 36:35.927
I build people up,

36:35.993 --> 36:38.696
and then I punish them
when they disappoint me.

36:38.763 --> 36:41.599
I did it with Wendy's dad,
and I do it with you.

36:41.666 --> 36:43.701
Nobody likes being
disappointed, right?

36:43.768 --> 36:46.704
I know. What I'm trying to say
is it's my own fault.

36:46.771 --> 36:48.272
It's not yours.

36:48.339 --> 36:50.608
No, I've given you plenty
of reasons to be mad.

36:50.675 --> 36:53.544
And more reasons to be happy.

36:54.879 --> 36:56.981
I agree.

37:02.687 --> 37:04.889
(heavy metal music blaring)

37:16.667 --> 37:19.604
I thought you said this
was supposed to be a date.

37:19.670 --> 37:20.771
Do you see her?

37:21.973 --> 37:23.908
Maybe we're at the wrong place.

37:27.445 --> 37:29.680
STEVE:
Boy, did you pick a winner.

37:29.747 --> 37:31.716
Steve, don't judge her yet,
all right?

37:31.782 --> 37:33.651
I'm telling you, she's sweet.

37:33.718 --> 37:36.420
MARTA: Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention please.

37:36.487 --> 37:38.756
Free your consciousness
and loosen your belts.

37:38.823 --> 37:40.858
That's her-- that's Marta.

37:40.925 --> 37:42.526
I'm telling you, Steve,
she's good.

37:42.593 --> 37:44.261
(flames whooshing, crackling)

37:44.328 --> 37:46.430
Let's just get the keys
and get out of here, okay?

37:46.497 --> 37:49.433
Shh. You said she was
a performance artist?

37:49.500 --> 37:51.802
I think she's performing.

37:51.869 --> 37:53.371
DAVID (recorded voice echoing):
Happen to believe

37:53.437 --> 37:54.505
the guy should
pick up the check.

37:54.572 --> 37:56.607
Happen to believe the guy
should pick up the check.

37:56.674 --> 37:59.710
Now that voice sounds
awfully familiar to me.

38:00.745 --> 38:03.447
DAVID:
My God, she taped me.

38:04.982 --> 38:06.617
DAVID (recording):
Happen to believe

38:06.684 --> 38:08.819
the guy should pick up
the check.

38:08.886 --> 38:12.523
Happen to believe the guy
should pick up the check.

38:12.590 --> 38:13.758
Ladies and gentlemen,

38:13.824 --> 38:17.595
welcome to my latest interactive
installation--

38:17.662 --> 38:19.063
"The Chauvinist."

38:19.130 --> 38:21.432
DAVID: Happen to believe the guy
should pick up the check.

38:21.499 --> 38:22.500
STEVE:
That's my car.

38:22.566 --> 38:24.301
Tell me this isn't happening.

38:24.368 --> 38:26.604
DAVID: Happen to believe the guy
should pick up the check.

38:27.972 --> 38:30.675
Happen to believe the guy
should pick up the check.

38:32.576 --> 38:35.312
Happen to believe the guy
should pick up the check.

38:36.647 --> 38:39.316
Happen to believe the guy
should pick up the check.

38:39.984 --> 38:42.687
(techno-pop blaring)

38:42.753 --> 38:45.690
Happen to believe the guy
should pick up the check.

38:46.824 --> 38:49.593
Happen-Happen...
Happen to believe...

38:49.660 --> 38:51.462
MARTA:
For the next hour,

38:51.529 --> 38:55.099
we will deconstruct
in an effort to reconstruct.

38:56.634 --> 38:59.637
Happen to believe the
guy should pick up the check.

38:59.704 --> 39:02.006
Happen to believe the guy
should pick up the check.

39:02.073 --> 39:04.075
Happen to believe...
Happen to believe...

39:04.141 --> 39:06.944
Happen to believe the guy...
Happen to believe the guy...

39:07.011 --> 39:08.879
(chainsaw whirring)

39:10.448 --> 39:12.383
Steve, you kept
the check, right?

39:12.450 --> 39:14.618
-(Janet laughs)
-Yeah.

39:14.685 --> 39:15.986
That's good.

39:19.190 --> 39:21.726
I think the sale's final.

39:36.507 --> 39:37.875
(door opening)

39:37.942 --> 39:38.943
KELLY:
Hey.

39:42.747 --> 39:43.848
Hi.

39:43.914 --> 39:45.850
I heard the news.

39:45.916 --> 39:47.618
Congratulations.

39:47.685 --> 39:48.686
Thanks.

39:48.753 --> 39:51.021
How was your trip?

39:51.088 --> 39:53.891
Small talk, right?

39:53.958 --> 39:56.527
Your request, not mine.

39:56.594 --> 39:59.163
I was wrong about that.

39:59.230 --> 40:00.598
I'm sorry.

40:00.664 --> 40:01.999
I wish you'd been here.

40:02.066 --> 40:04.135
I mean, not so you'd
change your mind.

40:04.201 --> 40:08.572
Just that moment, finding out--
it was incredible.

40:09.940 --> 40:12.543
And I wish I could have shared
it with you.

40:12.610 --> 40:14.612
Well, I'm here now.

40:14.678 --> 40:16.680
And I want to hear all about it.

40:16.747 --> 40:19.750
Did you see the sunset?

40:19.817 --> 40:22.953
No. No, I didn't.

40:23.020 --> 40:25.456
I thought I'd wait
and see it with you.

40:43.274 --> 40:45.643
Hey.

40:45.709 --> 40:46.544
What's that?

40:46.610 --> 40:48.045
Nothing. Just more bad news,
as usual.

40:48.112 --> 40:50.681
You want to talk about it?

40:50.748 --> 40:52.950
No, I don't want
to talk about it.

40:53.017 --> 40:55.686
You know, I thought
the ride back went pretty well.

40:55.753 --> 40:56.754
Really?

40:56.821 --> 40:57.755
No one said anything,

40:57.822 --> 41:00.724
but on balance, I think
that's the good news.

41:00.791 --> 41:03.661
I don't trust you.

41:03.727 --> 41:04.795
(sighs)

41:04.862 --> 41:06.764
Maybe I was wrong
this time, but...

41:06.831 --> 41:08.499
You were.

41:08.566 --> 41:12.503
It's going to take me being
wrong a lot

41:12.570 --> 41:14.071
before I feel differently.

41:14.138 --> 41:16.707
Well, I understand that.

41:16.774 --> 41:18.576
And I hope it happens.

41:21.145 --> 41:22.880
See ya.

41:22.947 --> 41:25.015
Where you going?

41:25.082 --> 41:26.984
I don't know.

41:31.755 --> 41:34.592
(door opens, closes)

41:43.100 --> 41:45.269
(tapping keys)

41:48.839 --> 41:50.040
Hi. Is this Jackie Taylor?

41:52.309 --> 41:55.012
I think there's something you
should know about your husband.

42:06.657 --> 42:09.026
(muffled laughing)
