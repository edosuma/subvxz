-(distant cough)
-The fuck?! Come on!

08:11.513 --> 08:13.097
It's play
off of The Mask.

08:13.180 --> 08:14.513
Uh, Chompy, you know,

08:14.596 --> 08:16.097
these ceremonies
aren't for grievances,

08:16.180 --> 08:18.055
but more of
a personal reflection.

08:18.138 --> 08:20.388
Oh, really? Then why is
Dawn complaining

08:20.471 --> 08:22.222
about you constantly
clogging the shower

08:22.305 --> 08:24.388
-with all your
ferret hair then?
-What?!

08:24.471 --> 08:25.930
-Gimme that!
-(Chompy screams)

08:26.013 --> 08:28.554
It was more like a personal
anecdotal stand-up bit,

08:28.638 --> 08:30.055
you know,
like Jim Gaffigan.

08:30.138 --> 08:31.679
(chuckles) He's still
a good guy, right?

08:31.763 --> 08:33.222
Where-- Where are
my Gaffigan-heads at?

08:33.305 --> 08:35.263
Hot Pockets!
(howls)

08:35.347 --> 08:37.930
Ooh, it's the thrill
of the drama!

08:38.013 --> 08:39.305
I love drama.

08:39.388 --> 08:40.763
Chompy, chomp-chomp!

08:40.846 --> 08:41.888
Chompy, enough!

08:41.971 --> 08:43.596
All you do is start trouble!

08:43.679 --> 08:46.429
It's 'cause Dawn
is a guinea pig
and I am a ferret!

08:46.513 --> 08:48.429
You know I'm the only
kind of my species!

08:48.513 --> 08:49.971
But, Yumi,

08:50.055 --> 08:53.055
I've been trying to tell you
something for a while now.

08:53.138 --> 08:54.638
You ain't the last ferret!

08:54.721 --> 08:58.263
There's a whole tribe of 'em
in South Squirrel Square!

08:58.347 --> 09:00.138
-(crowd murmuring)
-Chompy!

09:00.222 --> 09:01.471
Oh my God.

09:01.554 --> 09:03.263
Everybody go home!
The unburdening ceremony

09:03.347 --> 09:04.638
is canceled for
the rest of the day!

09:04.721 --> 09:06.721
(heavy metal music playing)

09:08.222 --> 09:09.763
Adventurin' horse.

09:09.846 --> 09:12.180
Adventurin',
doing tricks for money!

09:16.388 --> 09:18.846
Oh, are there really
more ferrets out there?

09:18.930 --> 09:20.180
(Dawn squeaking)

09:20.263 --> 09:21.596
Dawn!

09:21.679 --> 09:23.013
(squeaks)

09:23.097 --> 09:24.638
(Yumi sighs)

09:24.721 --> 09:28.596
From what I'm gathering
through body language,

09:28.679 --> 09:30.471
-it seems like you like it.
-(Yumi chittering)

09:30.554 --> 09:33.679
(chuckles)
Get in here,
you big furry worm.

09:33.763 --> 09:35.263
(romantic music plays on radio)

09:39.013 --> 09:40.596
Oh, what is that?

09:40.679 --> 09:42.638
(chittering)

09:42.721 --> 09:43.971
Yumi: Is that supposed
to be me?

09:44.055 --> 09:45.638
Dawn: I don't think
all ferrets look the same.

09:45.721 --> 09:47.138
That's not cool, Yumi!

09:47.222 --> 09:48.638
You know what?
We're gonna have this out.

09:48.721 --> 09:50.138
We're going to the
communicator right now.

09:50.222 --> 09:51.180
Yumi:
Come with me!

09:51.263 --> 09:53.347
(electronic music playing)

09:53.429 --> 09:55.305
Hey, Mike?

09:55.388 --> 09:57.138
You know, Mike, we said
we were gonna go steal
the talk-box thingy

09:57.222 --> 09:59.347
at 8:00 p.m., and it's 7:55.

09:59.429 --> 10:01.971
-I mean, we don't know
what traffic's gonna be like.
-Give me a second! I just--

10:02.055 --> 10:05.180
I just need to put on the
dang eyelash to my right eye,

10:05.263 --> 10:07.347
-and that's gonna be it, okay?
-Hold on a second, Mike.

10:07.429 --> 10:09.471
Why are you dressed
like a geisha?

10:09.554 --> 10:12.554
Because you're dressed
like a ninja, so I'm on theme.

10:12.638 --> 10:15.013
We're not going to
a Halloween party, Mike!

10:15.097 --> 10:17.513
But we're a couple,
so we have to complement
each other.

10:17.596 --> 10:19.180
-That's the whole thing!
-No, no, no, Mike!

10:19.263 --> 10:21.013
We're going on
a smash-and-grab, okay?

10:21.097 --> 10:23.013
That means we need
to be stealthy.

10:23.097 --> 10:24.971
-I can move
perfectly fine in this.
-(shoes clacking)

10:25.055 --> 10:27.471
You're wearing
wooden little sandals!

10:27.554 --> 10:29.013
I love my wooden blocks

10:29.097 --> 10:31.013
that I'm wearing
on my little feet!

10:31.097 --> 10:33.554
(sighs)
I can't get angry
at those petite feet.

10:33.638 --> 10:34.679
They are too cute.

10:34.763 --> 10:36.305
Stick out your tongue
right now.

10:36.388 --> 10:38.055
Ah...

10:40.429 --> 10:42.679
Damn chinchillas
smell like milk

10:42.763 --> 10:44.388
and it drives me crazy!

10:44.471 --> 10:46.347
And the gerbils
are cheap and lazy.

10:46.429 --> 10:48.554
Chompy for high priestess!

10:48.638 --> 10:49.721
Chompy!

10:49.805 --> 10:51.554
What the hell's
going on over here?

10:51.638 --> 10:53.554
-Saved the Day is
not just an emo band.
-Stand back, you guys.

10:53.638 --> 10:56.013
All right, all right!
That is it!

10:56.097 --> 10:59.222
This object is officially
off-limits to everyone.

10:59.305 --> 11:01.513
Report back to your
homes immediately.

11:01.596 --> 11:03.055
-(clacking)
-(Phil shushing)

11:03.138 --> 11:05.763
Is there any way you can
keep those down a little bit?

11:05.846 --> 11:08.596
I'm sorry, it's just--
it comes with the territory
of the geisha.

11:08.679 --> 11:09.971
Phil (whispering):
Fine, fine, fine!

11:11.596 --> 11:13.347
Do you know if it's
blue wire to red wire?

11:13.429 --> 11:14.721
-Just twist 'em up.
-(engine starts)

11:14.805 --> 11:16.888
Oh! Oh my God!
Can I just say something?

11:16.971 --> 11:19.013
These Grabbags,
they're good at making shit.

11:19.097 --> 11:20.429
I mean, their progress
is incredible.

11:20.513 --> 11:21.930
The last one ran on grapes.

11:22.013 --> 11:23.596
Mike:
Shit! Oh, shit.
Who is that?

11:23.679 --> 11:25.097
I think that's Dawn.

11:25.180 --> 11:26.763
She's dating, uh, Yumi.

11:26.846 --> 11:28.554
The high priestess
of the Grabbags?

11:28.638 --> 11:31.554
See you've been picking up
on the ins and outs
of the Grabbaggers.

11:31.638 --> 11:32.763
Dawn is dating Yumi,

11:32.846 --> 11:34.805
and Bruce just
cheated on Alex

11:34.888 --> 11:36.429
-with Terrence.
-No!

11:36.513 --> 11:37.471
(thrumming)

11:37.554 --> 11:40.222
Yumi:
Oh, great, grand orb.

11:40.305 --> 11:42.263
This gift that you bestowed,

11:42.347 --> 11:43.971
it's not bringing us together.

11:44.055 --> 11:45.930
It's tearing
Grabbagville apart.

11:46.013 --> 11:47.596
But it doesn't
have to!

11:47.679 --> 11:48.596
(gasps)
Chompy.

11:48.679 --> 11:49.971
You know, Yumi,

11:50.055 --> 11:53.055
the ability to communicate
to every species,

11:53.138 --> 11:55.263
that's a hot commodity!

11:55.347 --> 11:58.805
And with the twist
of a word or two
here and there--

11:58.888 --> 12:00.222
-bam!
-(gasps)

12:00.305 --> 12:03.013
Suddenly, instead of
the rats asking the horses

12:03.097 --> 12:04.638
for ten pounds of grain,

12:04.721 --> 12:07.638
they said, "Hey, horse,
fuck you!"

12:07.721 --> 12:10.263
And then the rats
are battling the horses,

12:10.347 --> 12:12.180
and the cats
are battling the dogs,

12:12.263 --> 12:16.305
and Chompy's chomping
all the chomp-chomps, baby!

12:16.388 --> 12:19.596
We are not starting
an animals war, Chompy.

12:19.679 --> 12:20.638
(groans)

12:20.721 --> 12:23.013
You're the boss, Yumi.

12:23.097 --> 12:25.222
-Chomp you later.
-(Yumi groans)

12:29.263 --> 12:30.888
(thrumming)

12:32.013 --> 12:33.263
I think I'm just jealous

12:33.347 --> 12:35.180
because I wanted
to dress up like a geisha.

12:35.263 --> 12:36.638
He looks so pretty.

12:36.721 --> 12:38.930
That's my problem is
that I always go practical.

12:39.013 --> 12:40.305
(screaming)

12:40.388 --> 12:41.471
(grunts)

12:41.554 --> 12:42.679
(Phil groans)

12:42.763 --> 12:44.554
Oh, this rearview
camera is so cool.

12:44.638 --> 12:47.180
Oh my God! Phil!
Are you okay? What happened?

12:47.263 --> 12:49.055
I got injured.

12:49.138 --> 12:50.554
-Oh, no.
-I'm a nin-jure.

12:50.638 --> 12:52.013
-(Mike chuckles)
-I'm nin-jured.

12:52.097 --> 12:53.305
Let me go ahead
and get you home.

12:53.388 --> 12:54.846
Whoa, come on,
help me load

12:54.930 --> 12:56.679
the talk-box thingy
into the car.

12:56.763 --> 12:58.513
Oh, yeah, that's what
we're here for. We did it!

12:58.596 --> 13:00.013
Nice, good work.

13:00.097 --> 13:01.180
Yeah, thanks, buddy.

13:01.263 --> 13:03.055
You wanna jerk me off
on the ride home?

13:03.138 --> 13:05.138
-Mike: Yeah!
-(tires squeal)

13:06.429 --> 13:08.138
Right, okay.
Stop. Honk the horn.

13:08.222 --> 13:09.721
(horn plays "Dixie")

13:09.805 --> 13:11.513
-(Mike burps)
-Excuse me!

13:11.596 --> 13:14.721
Cold-blooded brethren
of the underground!

13:14.805 --> 13:16.513
Hi! (chuckles)

13:16.596 --> 13:18.180
Uh, my name's Phil,

13:18.263 --> 13:20.222
-and this is
my partner, Mike.
-That's me.

13:20.305 --> 13:23.347
Us reptiles have been
confined to these sewers

13:23.429 --> 13:25.971
for three long years

13:26.055 --> 13:28.554
using gosh-darn heat lamps
to mimic sunlight,

13:28.638 --> 13:30.721
which sure, heat lamps
are the shit.

13:30.805 --> 13:32.721
Whoo! Heat lamps!
(laughs)

13:32.805 --> 13:34.679
But we believe that it's time

13:34.763 --> 13:36.388
that all of us
freaky-ass,

13:36.471 --> 13:38.846
green-skinned,
ugly motherfuckers

13:38.930 --> 13:41.554
unify and reclaim
the above land

13:41.638 --> 13:43.554
from all those warm-blooded,

13:43.638 --> 13:45.930
fur-covered, nasty-ass
animals up there!

13:46.013 --> 13:47.222
Heat lamps!

13:47.305 --> 13:48.763
God! What are you doing?
What are you doing?

13:48.846 --> 13:50.721
-I love the heat. I thought--
-It's okay. It's fine.

13:50.805 --> 13:53.055
-(growling, hissing)
-We need your help.

13:53.138 --> 13:54.513
We need your strength.

13:54.596 --> 13:57.222
We're proposing that
we drill directly above us,

13:57.305 --> 14:00.055
and take over the weakest link
of the "warmbloodeds":

14:00.138 --> 14:02.554
-the Grabbags.
-Mike: Ew, they nasty!

14:02.638 --> 14:05.263
Whatever. They've got this
all-powerful floating disco ball

14:05.347 --> 14:07.055
that Mike and I wanna
put in our living room.

14:07.138 --> 14:08.971
It's gonna tie the room
together so nicely.

14:09.055 --> 14:10.763
Whoo! Yes!
Tomorrow...

14:10.846 --> 14:13.596
(in deep, gravelly voice):
we take over the above-land.

14:13.679 --> 14:15.554
Yeah! Heat lamps!
(giggles)

14:15.638 --> 14:17.180
Fuckin' heat lamps!

14:19.055 --> 14:20.138
(chittering, squeaking)

14:20.222 --> 14:21.305
Yumi:
What-- What's going on?

14:21.388 --> 14:24.097
(gasps) The talk-box
thingy's missing!

14:24.180 --> 14:25.763
Oh my God.
Somebody took it.

14:25.846 --> 14:27.222
(orb thrumming)

14:27.305 --> 14:29.638
Chompy! Chompy,
you did this, didn't you?

14:29.721 --> 14:30.971
(squeaks)

14:31.055 --> 14:32.721
You stole it!
Where is it? Give it to me!

14:32.805 --> 14:34.888
Yumi, you're being crazy.
Please calm down.

14:34.971 --> 14:37.263
Give it back!
Son of a bitch!

14:37.347 --> 14:38.930
(gasps)

14:39.013 --> 14:41.138
Oh, shit.
We're allowed to do that?

14:41.222 --> 14:42.222
(whispers):
What have I done?

14:42.305 --> 14:44.638
Grabbag riot!

14:44.721 --> 14:47.222
(punk rock music playing)

14:47.305 --> 14:49.429
I've lost control of myself.

14:49.513 --> 14:51.097
I've lost control of my people,

14:51.180 --> 14:52.971
but are these
even my people?

14:53.055 --> 14:54.805
(punk rock music continuing)

14:54.888 --> 14:56.638
I'm gonna go
to Squirrel Square

14:56.721 --> 14:58.638
and find my family.
I'm sorry!

14:58.721 --> 15:00.263
Especially Dawn.

15:00.347 --> 15:01.679
(cries)
Goodbye.

15:01.763 --> 15:03.263
(grunting)

15:03.347 --> 15:04.971
Does anyone know
what she said?

15:05.055 --> 15:06.763
Okay, I'll see you
later, honey.

15:06.846 --> 15:08.805
(punk rock music continuing)

15:08.888 --> 15:11.013
(birds twittering)

15:11.097 --> 15:12.222
Oh!

15:14.721 --> 15:16.347
Hey, check it out.
A new ferret!

15:16.429 --> 15:18.305
Yumi? Is that...

15:18.388 --> 15:19.971
Is that you, Yumi?

15:20.055 --> 15:21.805
Dad?

15:21.888 --> 15:23.513
(punk rock music continuing)

15:23.596 --> 15:25.805
(growling, grunting)

15:25.888 --> 15:26.971
You know what? Listen.

15:27.055 --> 15:28.138
Can I say something?

15:28.222 --> 15:30.305
This fuckin' orb
is weird, right?

15:30.388 --> 15:32.138
What's the deal
with this thing?

15:32.222 --> 15:33.971
I mean, why in the heck
are we praying

15:34.055 --> 15:35.388
to a big, floating marble?

15:35.471 --> 15:38.388
Hey, Chompy ain't
scared of you, marble.

15:38.471 --> 15:40.180
You dumb fuck-boy!

15:40.263 --> 15:42.513
-(loud rumbling)
-Oh, shit.

15:42.596 --> 15:45.471
Hey, I was just
playing with you, orb.

15:45.554 --> 15:46.721
Chompy's cool.

15:49.097 --> 15:50.971
(electronic music playing)

15:52.222 --> 15:57.013
-Attention, Grabbags!
-Hello! Hi, everybody.

15:57.097 --> 16:00.347
I-- I feel like
I don't have that much
of a commanding voice.

16:00.429 --> 16:02.347
I was gonna say,
they don't look scared.

16:02.429 --> 16:03.513
You want Jeremy to do it?

16:03.596 --> 16:05.055
-Hey, Jeremy!
-(ribbits)

16:05.138 --> 16:06.471
Can you come up here?
Yeah, come on up.

16:06.554 --> 16:07.846
-Come here!
-(ribbits)

24:13.554 --> 24:15.721
You wanted an
omnipotent floating orb

24:15.805 --> 24:17.888
to simply use
as decoration.

24:17.971 --> 24:19.180
Cut the crap!

24:19.263 --> 24:21.013
What do you say, Yumi?

24:21.097 --> 24:23.471
A gecko stew
or maybe a jerky?

24:23.554 --> 24:24.846
(gulps)

24:24.930 --> 24:26.180
Untie them
and send them
on their way.

24:26.263 --> 24:27.971
-What?!
-You heard me.

24:28.055 --> 24:30.222
Let's bite their
fucking heads off!

24:30.305 --> 24:32.846
Chompy's looking to
chomp-chomp, baby!

24:32.930 --> 24:34.930
Yeah, Yumi, one of
the little green dudes

24:35.013 --> 24:36.888
was about to
chop my head off,

24:36.971 --> 24:39.055
-if you remember correctly.
-No, no, no! No,
you got it all wrong!

24:39.138 --> 24:40.513
I wouldn't have
done it really.

24:40.596 --> 24:41.679
I wouldn't have!

24:41.763 --> 24:43.347
I just like the threat
of violence.

24:43.429 --> 24:44.971
-It's just a threat.
-(grunts)

24:45.846 --> 24:48.222
Grabbags of Grabbagville,

24:48.305 --> 24:50.721
reptiles of the underworld,

24:50.805 --> 24:52.055
don't you see?

24:52.138 --> 24:53.347
We're the same.

24:53.429 --> 24:55.013
Perhaps our blood is warm,

24:55.097 --> 24:56.721
and we have fur
instead of scales,

24:56.805 --> 25:00.055
but we are
diverse species united.

25:00.138 --> 25:01.222
That Yumi.

25:01.305 --> 25:03.930
Fuck me!
She's so good
at this crap.

25:04.013 --> 25:06.846
Yumi: The orb is
a symbol of inclusion.

25:06.930 --> 25:08.888
We will no longer shroud it

25:08.971 --> 25:10.721
under our ceremonial tent.

25:10.805 --> 25:13.222
It is not ours to keep.

25:13.305 --> 25:16.554
The orb belongs
to all animals,

25:16.638 --> 25:18.596
as does this tool:

25:18.679 --> 25:21.638
The Grand Communicator.

25:21.721 --> 25:25.138
Reptiles, join us
in rebuilding.

25:25.222 --> 25:26.971
That sounds like a plan!

25:27.055 --> 25:28.471
What do you say, reptiles?

25:28.554 --> 25:31.305
Mike: Yes!
We're getting married!

25:31.388 --> 25:33.638
(cheering)

25:33.721 --> 25:35.347
(rock music playing)

25:36.513 --> 25:38.805
Yumi:
There it is, the future.

25:38.888 --> 25:40.596
(indistinct chatter)

25:40.679 --> 25:42.805
Both:
Grand Communicator
Communications, please hold.

25:42.888 --> 25:44.971
-(indistinct chatter)
-(phones ringing)

25:46.846 --> 25:49.638
Oh, boy. Can you
not draw a circle?

25:49.721 --> 25:51.596
-Okay. Okay, got it.
-There shouldn't be a point.

25:51.679 --> 25:53.305
We need to float
some pre-release models

25:53.388 --> 25:55.596
to the social media influencers
and early adopters in tech.

25:55.679 --> 25:57.138
Those fucking freaks.

25:57.222 --> 25:59.596
And then offer up the
pre-sale code in conjunction

25:59.679 --> 26:01.305
with the Spotify promo!

26:01.388 --> 26:03.263
-Come on, guys, wake up.
-Chompy, please!

26:03.347 --> 26:05.971
We need to run a
ballsy outdoor campaign.

26:06.055 --> 26:08.513
You know, turn some heads!

26:08.596 --> 26:09.846
What about this?

26:09.930 --> 26:13.263
Grand Communicator 3.0:
Fuck Your Mother!

26:13.347 --> 26:14.513
-(farts)
-Chompy!

26:14.596 --> 26:16.305
Chompy is a friggin' genius.

26:16.388 --> 26:18.805
Thank you. I mean,
I like the idea,
of "ballsy outdoor campaign,"

26:18.888 --> 26:20.930
but then, after that,
nothing else is really usable.

26:21.013 --> 26:22.638
"Fuck your mother!"
Come on!

26:22.721 --> 26:24.471
Let's move on to
the next point, please.
