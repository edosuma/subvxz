WEBVTT

00:10.343 --> 00:11.511
Morning.
- Hey!

00:11.611 --> 00:14.781
Have a good one!

00:22.756 --> 00:25.158
Well, no,
I haven't told Darby yet.

00:25.258 --> 00:27.427
You know how she overreacts.

00:27.527 --> 00:28.995
But I am telling you, Sarita,

00:29.095 --> 00:31.531
I have not written
this fast in years.

00:31.631 --> 00:34.834
This new character
is changing everything!

00:34.934 --> 00:37.404
Of course, yes.
I'm excited, too.

00:37.504 --> 00:40.440
I promise,
you're going to love it.

00:46.946 --> 00:51.251
Ex-cop who was
kicked off the force?

00:51.351 --> 00:54.354
Surly...
Handsome...

00:54.454 --> 00:57.023
Bryn's long-lost daughter...

00:57.123 --> 00:59.626
Clodagh?!

00:59.726 --> 01:01.594
Darby, are you home?

01:01.694 --> 01:02.929
We're wheels up in 20!

01:03.029 --> 01:04.998
Ugh!

01:13.706 --> 01:16.876
Ugh, this is really
not what I need today.

01:16.976 --> 01:18.144
Would you
stop sulking?

01:18.244 --> 01:20.246
You promised last week
when you borrowed my car

01:20.346 --> 01:22.382
that you would come to
this estate auction with me.

01:22.482 --> 01:24.284
But you also said you
would wear something nice!

01:24.384 --> 01:26.086
Well, I didn't know
it would be like

01:26.186 --> 01:27.387
something out of your novels!

01:27.487 --> 01:30.223
Speaking of, how are your
new pages coming along?

01:30.323 --> 01:32.358
Um... good!
Fine, actually.

01:32.459 --> 01:34.794
Yeah? Feeling particularly
inspired, are we?

01:34.894 --> 01:36.696
- As a matter of fact, I am!
- Hmm!

01:36.796 --> 01:39.199
Well, hello, ladies!
Hello!

01:39.299 --> 01:41.601
Why am I here if
you knew Rory would be here?

01:41.701 --> 01:43.736
Just to soak up a little
A.B. culture, hmm?

01:43.837 --> 01:45.972
- Alder Bluffs.
- Thank you, I got it.

01:46.072 --> 01:48.441
This place is owned
by Zelda Hoffman.

01:48.541 --> 01:50.977
Wealthy widow,
total firecracker.

01:51.077 --> 01:52.712
She had impeccable taste.

01:52.812 --> 01:54.280
Oh, dear.
Has she died?

01:54.380 --> 01:56.282
Oh, no.
Apparently she's moved into

01:56.382 --> 01:57.417
an upscale nursing home.

01:57.517 --> 01:59.686
Her daughter
put this whole thing on.

01:59.786 --> 02:02.622
Ah, there are some
serious pieces up for sale!

02:02.722 --> 02:03.823
Ooh!

02:03.923 --> 02:05.058
You might see, uh...

02:05.158 --> 02:06.659
an art deco hoodie, Darby!

02:08.394 --> 02:10.029
Great.

02:12.265 --> 02:15.468
$1,500 for a trifle bowl?!

02:15.568 --> 02:17.170
And then you have to eat trifle.

02:17.270 --> 02:19.672
Lucas!
What are you doing here?

02:19.772 --> 02:22.809
Yeah, Lindsay saw this thing
about "eclectic centrepieces"

02:22.909 --> 02:24.310
on some hip wedding blog,

02:24.410 --> 02:27.080
so we figured
that this would be...

02:27.180 --> 02:29.015
- eclectic?
- Well, sure.

02:29.115 --> 02:33.186
Nothing says "I do" quite
like naked babies on stuff.

02:33.286 --> 02:34.654
Mm-hm!
Yeah, exactly.

02:34.754 --> 02:36.856
That's why I'm having
my groomsmen dress like that.

02:36.956 --> 02:38.625
Oh!
Nice!

02:38.725 --> 02:40.193
- Oh, Darby!
- Hi!

02:40.293 --> 02:43.163
- Hey, it's good to see you!
- You, too.

02:43.263 --> 02:45.598
- You look gorgeous, as always.
- Thanks.

02:45.698 --> 02:49.269
This ensemble
started as a silent protest

02:49.369 --> 02:52.739
against my mom, but now
it just feels like a self-own.

02:52.839 --> 02:54.841
Hey, the more dressed down,

02:54.941 --> 02:56.442
the richer people think you are.

02:56.543 --> 02:58.678
Oh, then everyone here
must think I'm loaded.

02:58.778 --> 03:02.048
Definitely.

03:02.148 --> 03:03.216
Um...

03:03.316 --> 03:05.718
Hey, I've been taking
like a zillion photos

03:05.818 --> 03:07.353
for wedding inspo,
and I realized

03:07.453 --> 03:09.489
I don't even have one
of the bride and groom!

03:09.589 --> 03:12.525
- Do you mind?
- Not at all!

03:12.625 --> 03:14.027
Okay.

03:14.127 --> 03:16.296
Uh... say "trifle"!

03:16.396 --> 03:18.531
Trifle!

03:18.631 --> 03:20.366
I took a bunch.
Oh, awesome.

03:20.466 --> 03:21.501
Thank you.

03:21.601 --> 03:22.969
Can I have
your attention, please?

03:23.069 --> 03:24.671
Ladies and gentlemen,
the auction is about to start.

03:24.771 --> 03:26.673
I should find seats.
I can't miss this.

03:26.773 --> 03:28.942
Don't miss it.
Run, don't walk!

03:29.042 --> 03:30.843
Um...
Hey, listen.

03:30.944 --> 03:32.812
This may sound odd.

03:32.912 --> 03:35.815
I was wondering if you and I
could have lunch?

03:35.915 --> 03:38.618
I'd really like us
to be friends.

03:38.718 --> 03:39.919
Yeah!

03:40.019 --> 03:42.889
Great.
Yes... um, when?

03:42.989 --> 03:45.758
Um... soon.

03:45.858 --> 03:47.393
Super soon.

03:47.493 --> 03:48.728
Okay.

03:48.828 --> 03:53.099
- See you out there.
- Okay!

03:53.199 --> 03:56.002
Okay...

03:56.102 --> 03:58.238
Ladies
and gentlemen, welcome.

03:58.338 --> 03:59.872
Bidding will commence shortly.

03:59.973 --> 04:03.042
But first, I'd like to invite
our hostess, Moira Hoffman,

04:03.142 --> 04:04.377
to say a few words.

04:06.679 --> 04:08.715
Okay... wow!

04:08.815 --> 04:11.417
My mother would be
so touched by this turnout.

04:11.517 --> 04:13.052
As some of you know,
she was recently moved

04:13.152 --> 04:14.721
to a care facility.

04:14.821 --> 04:16.055
And, you know, while they say

04:16.155 --> 04:18.825
that you can't put a price
on a loved one's care...

04:18.925 --> 04:21.427
they have.
A large one!

04:21.527 --> 04:24.130
Uh...

04:24.230 --> 04:26.432
So, um...

04:26.532 --> 04:28.968
please bid generously and, um...

04:29.068 --> 04:29.936
thanks.

04:31.638 --> 04:33.539
Thank you,
Miss Hoffman. Alright...

04:33.640 --> 04:35.575
Archer Lancaster.

04:35.675 --> 04:38.678
Thinks he's God's gift
to antiques.

04:38.778 --> 04:41.414
I outbid him on
a Hepplewhite chaise last year

04:41.514 --> 04:43.449
and he's hated me ever since.

04:43.549 --> 04:47.153
And first up,
we have Lot #129.

04:47.253 --> 04:48.821
This is it!

04:48.921 --> 04:50.456
It's early Deco.

04:50.556 --> 04:52.091
Neo-Egyptian piece.

04:52.191 --> 04:53.760
Wow, it's lovely.
You should bid on it.

04:53.860 --> 04:55.128
I'm going to!

04:55.228 --> 04:58.464
And the bidding
will begin at $400.

04:58.564 --> 04:59.532
$400.

04:59.632 --> 05:01.401
400 to
the gentleman; do I hear--

05:01.501 --> 05:02.869
500.
500.

05:02.969 --> 05:04.604
- Do I have six?
- Six.

05:04.704 --> 05:07.206
I have 600.
Do I hear seven?

05:07.307 --> 05:09.409
700 to the woman in the back.

05:09.509 --> 05:10.777
1,100.

05:10.877 --> 05:12.945
I hear 1,100
for the gentleman in the front.

05:13.046 --> 05:14.347
- Do I have--
- 1,200.

05:14.447 --> 05:15.815
1,200.

05:15.915 --> 05:17.150
1,300.

05:17.250 --> 05:19.886
Yes, I have 1,300
to the gentleman in front.

05:19.986 --> 05:22.188
3,000!

05:23.890 --> 05:26.693
The bid stands at $3,000.

05:26.793 --> 05:30.029
Going once...
Going twice...

05:30.129 --> 05:31.497
Sold!

05:31.597 --> 05:33.466
Well done, sir.

05:44.577 --> 05:45.945
You didn't
even buy anything!

05:46.045 --> 05:48.648
That's not the point, darling.
The point is to have fun.

05:48.748 --> 05:52.585
Well, that redefined
"fun" for me, so success!

05:52.685 --> 05:54.887
What's wrong with you?
Is your blood sugar low?

05:54.987 --> 05:55.988
You're so surly.

05:56.089 --> 05:57.023
- Surly?
- Mm-hm!

05:57.123 --> 05:58.891
That's a funny word
for you to use.

06:00.993 --> 06:03.229
Oh, by all means,
take your call.

06:03.329 --> 06:07.700
Hello?

06:07.800 --> 06:09.369
Rory?

06:09.469 --> 06:11.304
He pocket-dialled you.
Just hang up.

06:11.404 --> 06:12.338
Okay.

06:13.873 --> 06:16.609
Oh, come on,
just pass me then, alright?

06:16.709 --> 06:17.977
Rory, is everything alright?

06:19.445 --> 06:21.414
No, no, no!
What are you doing?

06:21.514 --> 06:23.883
No, no, noooo!

06:23.983 --> 06:25.852
Rory!

06:42.802 --> 06:44.771
Okay, okay,
white car, tinted windows.

06:44.871 --> 06:45.872
We got that.

06:45.972 --> 06:47.540
Listen, I don't think
you're taking this

06:47.640 --> 06:48.775
with the gravity it deserves!

06:48.875 --> 06:50.877
Alright, the only sets
of tire tracks off the road

06:50.977 --> 06:51.944
are yours, Mr. Isenor, alright?

06:52.044 --> 06:53.246
That's not much to go on.

06:53.346 --> 06:54.881
This is a case for
your insurance company,

06:54.981 --> 06:56.716
- not for the police.
- I am telling you,

06:56.816 --> 06:57.984
someone is trying to kill me!

06:58.084 --> 07:00.253
And I am telling you to
calm down before I arrest you

07:00.353 --> 07:02.054
for wasting police time.
Enough!

07:02.155 --> 07:04.257
If Alder Bluffs'
"finest"

07:04.357 --> 07:07.894
won't take this case seriously,
then the Spencer Sisters will.

07:07.994 --> 07:09.328
Wait, what?
We will?

07:09.429 --> 07:10.663
Really?

07:10.763 --> 07:12.999
Okay, whatever.
He's all yours.

07:13.099 --> 07:15.301
Alright, someone
call a damn tow truck.

07:15.401 --> 07:17.103
You're serious?

07:17.203 --> 07:19.238
That the Spencer Sisters
will take my case?

07:19.338 --> 07:20.373
Of course!

07:20.473 --> 07:21.908
Oh, but no friend discount!

07:22.008 --> 07:25.244
I want to pay the full price!

07:25.344 --> 07:26.512
I need to get my cat.

07:26.612 --> 07:29.749
Okay, we're not seriously
taking this case on, are we?

07:29.849 --> 07:32.752
Harris is an ass, sure,
but attempted murder?

07:32.852 --> 07:35.254
Mom, Rory probably just
got spooked when someone

07:35.354 --> 07:37.924
tried to pass him while
he was staring at his dumb cat.

07:38.024 --> 07:40.693
We don't know that.
And besides, a case is a case.

07:40.793 --> 07:41.861
Fine.

07:41.961 --> 07:43.763
But we have to treat it
like any other case.

07:43.863 --> 07:45.665
It's not like something
from one of your novels.

07:45.765 --> 07:48.668
As if you've ever
read any of my novels!

07:48.768 --> 07:50.837
Oh, it's alright!

07:50.937 --> 07:52.472
Ah, it's safe.

07:52.572 --> 07:55.475
Well, I guess I'd better
get a ride share or something.

07:55.575 --> 07:57.477
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

07:57.577 --> 08:00.079
We have plenty of room.
Darby can ride in back.

08:00.179 --> 08:03.015
Oh, yeah.
You can ride in the back.

08:03.115 --> 08:05.184
- I heard her.
- Mm-hm!

08:05.284 --> 08:07.186
Okay, Rory,
start from the beginning

08:07.286 --> 08:08.788
and tell us what happened.

08:08.888 --> 08:11.491
He came at me out of nowhere!

08:11.591 --> 08:13.359
Like a lunatic!

08:13.459 --> 08:15.294
I couldn't see his face,

08:15.394 --> 08:17.930
but I could feel the hatred
just burning at me!

08:18.030 --> 08:20.833
Except we don't actually
know that it was a man, right?

08:20.933 --> 08:23.169
- Because you couldn't see him?
- Oh...

08:23.269 --> 08:26.072
Are we sure this isn't
just a case of road rage?

08:26.172 --> 08:28.674
Maybe someone
wants you out of the picture.

08:28.774 --> 08:31.177
You mean like a conspiracy?

08:31.277 --> 08:34.180
Or maybe it was
a case of mistaken identity!

08:34.280 --> 08:35.515
Yes!

08:35.615 --> 08:38.684
The killer misidentified
me as his target!

08:38.784 --> 08:41.654
Okay, let's all just climb down
from the grassy knoll here

08:41.754 --> 08:43.322
for a second.

08:43.422 --> 08:45.858
Rory, I know when you've
had a scare it can be easy

08:45.958 --> 08:47.793
to jump right to assassins
and blood feuds.

08:47.894 --> 08:48.794
Yes!

08:48.895 --> 08:50.763
But when it comes
to real investigations,

08:50.863 --> 08:52.431
Occam's Razor is the rule.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.967
The simplest explanation
is usually the right one.

08:55.067 --> 08:57.069
But, as Bryn Martell
always says,

08:57.169 --> 08:58.971
"Sometimes Occam is wrong."

08:59.071 --> 09:00.673
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

09:00.773 --> 09:03.509
Bryn said that, specifically?

09:03.609 --> 09:04.911
Yeah, Book 9.

09:05.011 --> 09:06.579
"The Philosopher's Foible."

09:06.679 --> 09:09.482
Okay, Rory, do you
have any actual enemies

09:09.582 --> 09:13.386
who might want to hurt you?

09:13.486 --> 09:17.023
Oh!
Archer Lancaster!

09:17.123 --> 09:18.457
Ah, of course!

09:18.558 --> 09:20.426
He was furious
that you outbid him.

09:20.526 --> 09:22.695
Public humiliation
is a great motivator.

09:22.795 --> 09:24.764
Oh, Darby is well aware of that.

09:24.864 --> 09:28.234
Okay, fine.
Yes, Archer is a solid lead.

09:28.334 --> 09:31.070
Or at least a lead
here on Planet Earth,

09:31.170 --> 09:33.105
so we'll start there.

09:33.205 --> 09:35.608
- Let's go to his store.
- Right.

09:35.708 --> 09:37.677
Let's shake him down!

09:39.779 --> 09:41.113
Oh, Archer.

09:41.213 --> 09:45.484
You've just been eating yourself
up with jealousy, haven't you?

09:45.585 --> 09:48.120
What is it, exactly,
you're accusing me of?

09:48.220 --> 09:50.423
We want to know where
you went after the auction.

09:50.523 --> 09:51.657
Here.

09:51.757 --> 09:52.792
To lick my wounds.

09:52.892 --> 09:54.627
Oh, that is a lie!

09:54.727 --> 09:55.728
He's lying!

09:55.828 --> 09:58.464
Okay, maybe let me
take care of this.

09:58.564 --> 10:01.400
Liar!

10:01.500 --> 10:03.436
What route did you take?

10:03.536 --> 10:05.571
What's the make and model
of your vehicle?

10:05.671 --> 10:08.074
I don't believe
I have to tell you anything.

10:08.174 --> 10:09.575
You're not the police.

10:12.845 --> 10:13.779
Tsk-tsk-tsk.

10:13.879 --> 10:14.947
What?

10:15.047 --> 10:17.917
Oh, we were just admiring
your impeccable taste:

10:18.017 --> 10:21.654
Hepplewhite, Georgian,
mostly Victorian.

10:21.754 --> 10:23.289
But that cat you bid on?

10:23.389 --> 10:26.258
It was decidedly
Neo-Egyptian Art Deco.

10:26.359 --> 10:27.593
What gives?

10:27.693 --> 10:30.029
Fine.
You caught me.

10:30.129 --> 10:32.765
I never wanted that piece
of junk in the first place.

10:32.865 --> 10:34.333
Oh, bull!

10:34.433 --> 10:36.068
You bid against me for it!

10:37.436 --> 10:39.338
I was goading you
into overpaying.

10:40.539 --> 10:41.841
And, if you must know,

10:41.941 --> 10:44.777
that cat is a cheap
1970s reproduction.

10:44.877 --> 10:47.513
Can't imagine why Zelda Hoffman
even owned it.

10:47.613 --> 10:49.448
I know I wouldn't want to.

10:49.548 --> 10:54.253
Oh, and I drive a restored
powder blue 1969 Fiat Spider.

10:54.353 --> 10:58.124
It's parked out back
if you want to admire it.

11:04.296 --> 11:05.931
Well, there goes that lead.

11:06.032 --> 11:08.067
The real question is why
would Zelda have a worthless

11:08.167 --> 11:09.535
piece like that
in her collection?

11:09.635 --> 11:11.237
Well, it was a very good reproduction.

11:11.337 --> 11:13.172
I think anyone could
have been fooled by it.

11:13.272 --> 11:14.874
Wait a minute.

11:14.974 --> 11:16.475
There was a third bidder.

11:16.575 --> 11:18.110
A woman at the back.

11:18.210 --> 11:19.779
And then she just vanished.

11:19.879 --> 11:21.047
I remember her!

11:21.147 --> 11:25.651
Damn, I wish I made a mental
note of her paddle number.

11:25.751 --> 11:26.986
118.

11:27.086 --> 11:29.822
As Bryn would say,
"The devil is in the details."

11:29.922 --> 11:33.559
Yeah, Book 21.
"The Clockmaker's Crisis."

11:33.659 --> 11:34.827
Okay, fine.

11:34.927 --> 11:37.763
We'll go to the auction house
and we'll get her name.

11:39.231 --> 11:40.332
What?

11:40.433 --> 11:42.668
Auctions are
a very exclusive world.

11:42.768 --> 11:44.937
Their clients
count on discretion.

11:45.037 --> 11:46.706
Okay, so what do you suggest?

11:46.806 --> 11:48.174
Zelda's daughter, Moira,

11:48.274 --> 11:50.843
would have access
to the bidders list, right?

11:50.943 --> 11:54.213
We could use Rory's status
as a decorator to our advantage.

11:54.313 --> 11:55.381
How?

11:55.481 --> 11:57.817
She seemed very concerned
about selling everything.

11:57.917 --> 12:01.687
You could offer to work her list
and move the rest of her stock.

12:01.787 --> 12:04.190
Ooh, like undercover!

12:04.290 --> 12:08.060
Well, it's not undercover
when you're playing yourself.

12:10.329 --> 12:12.198
What-- what am I
supposed to do with this?

12:12.298 --> 12:14.033
Do you know
how big the bills are?

12:14.133 --> 12:16.035
I can't believe
this happened to you.

12:16.135 --> 12:19.972
And how expensive it is
there, it's like they just...

12:20.072 --> 12:22.108
Don't think you're
going a bit overboard?

12:22.208 --> 12:24.977
This isn't a stakeout,
and Moira isn't a suspect.

12:25.077 --> 12:27.613
Well, she could be!

12:29.849 --> 12:32.485
Yeah, she's a regular
femme fatale.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.520
Seriously, what is your problem?

12:34.620 --> 12:37.123
You seemed so happy when
you went out for your run today.

12:37.223 --> 12:40.159
I was, until you
dragged me into this mess.

12:40.259 --> 12:41.827
Or should I call it Book 31,

12:41.927 --> 12:44.063
"The Wealthy Widow's
Worthless Waste of Time"?

12:44.163 --> 12:46.398
Do you have a problem
with my writing?

12:46.499 --> 12:48.667
Well, actually, I kind of do,
and I wanted to--

12:48.768 --> 12:51.170
We have
the list of bidders!

12:51.270 --> 12:52.404
Mm-hm-hm!

12:52.505 --> 12:53.839
Oh, she's quite a talker.

12:53.939 --> 12:55.441
And a crier. Hmm.

12:55.541 --> 12:56.609
I see that.

12:56.709 --> 12:59.178
Paddle 118--
Francesca Diavolo?

12:59.278 --> 13:00.746
Oh, a glamorous name!

13:00.846 --> 13:02.782
Like something
out of one of your novels!

13:02.882 --> 13:04.116
- Oh, you don't say.
- Mm-hm!

13:04.216 --> 13:05.518
Hmph!

13:05.618 --> 13:09.522
Ah, looks like she lives
at 66 Heathcliff Lane.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.624
Let's go.

13:16.495 --> 13:18.731
66 Heathcliff Lane?

13:18.831 --> 13:20.666
You've gotta be kidding me!

13:20.766 --> 13:25.971
So, Francesca Diavolo lied
on her bidding application?

13:26.071 --> 13:27.506
How baroque.

13:27.606 --> 13:29.608
Seems like
Bryn Martell was right,

13:29.708 --> 13:32.211
and Occam was wrong.

13:37.383 --> 13:39.618
Oh, good morning.
Orange juice?

13:39.718 --> 13:41.353
- Did you spend the night?
- Yes.

13:41.453 --> 13:44.456
I had my housekeeper
drop off a weekend bag.

13:44.557 --> 13:46.792
I thought it was safest,
what with this

13:46.892 --> 13:49.829
Diavolo character on the loose.

13:49.929 --> 13:51.230
There you are!

13:51.330 --> 13:53.899
Alastair just got back to me,
and there are no hits

13:53.999 --> 13:56.836
for "Francesca Diavolo"
anywhere near Alder Bluffs.

13:56.936 --> 13:58.938
Great, now we're
back to no leads.

14:01.740 --> 14:03.142
Ugh!

14:03.242 --> 14:05.411
Lindsay tagged me in the photo
that I took of her and Lucas.

14:05.511 --> 14:07.012
And she used
the triple fire emoji.

14:07.112 --> 14:08.914
Look, my day just
keeps getting better.

14:09.014 --> 14:10.149
They are gorgeous together,

14:10.249 --> 14:12.084
but it's best
not to dwell, honey.

14:12.184 --> 14:15.020
Hey, wait a minute.

14:15.120 --> 14:18.858
Isn't this the Francesca Diavolo
woman or whatever her name is?

14:18.958 --> 14:21.794
- Look.
- It is! Good work, honey.

14:21.894 --> 14:24.230
Lindsay took a lot of
photos at the auction.

14:24.330 --> 14:27.066
I wonder if our mystery woman's
in the background of those.

14:27.166 --> 14:28.400
You...

14:28.500 --> 14:29.802
text Lindsay
and get those photos.

14:29.902 --> 14:31.203
Yeah.

14:31.303 --> 14:32.571
Oh, no, no!

14:32.671 --> 14:34.540
No, I can't do that
because if I do that,

14:34.640 --> 14:36.342
Lindsay will make me
go to lunch with her!

14:36.442 --> 14:38.344
Well, it's for the good
of the case, honey.

14:44.283 --> 14:45.484
Small talk.

14:45.584 --> 14:46.785
Appetizer only.

14:46.886 --> 14:50.022
Get the photos and get out.

14:50.122 --> 14:51.757
Darby, hi!

14:51.857 --> 14:54.860
Hey!

14:54.960 --> 14:57.062
I am so glad
we can make this work!

14:57.162 --> 14:59.365
Oh, me too, me too.

14:59.465 --> 15:03.269
I've always wanted to come here,
so this is very exciting for me.

15:03.369 --> 15:06.205
Oh!
Yeah!

15:06.305 --> 15:09.975
Anyway...

15:10.075 --> 15:13.579
I could use your help with
a case, if you're willing.

15:13.679 --> 15:16.081
Oh!
Okay, shoot.

15:16.181 --> 15:19.084
Could you send me the photos
you took at the auction?

15:19.184 --> 15:21.420
Like of me and Lucas?

15:21.520 --> 15:23.088
Of everything.

15:23.188 --> 15:25.124
And this is for a case?

15:25.224 --> 15:26.558
Yes.

15:26.659 --> 15:29.461
A mysterious woman
ran our client off the road

15:29.561 --> 15:31.797
because he bought what
turned out to be a worthless

15:31.897 --> 15:32.998
statue of a cat.

15:33.098 --> 15:35.367
And as I say that out loud,

15:35.467 --> 15:37.169
I realize it sounds
super made-up,

15:37.269 --> 15:40.940
but your photos
might help us identify her.

15:41.040 --> 15:43.842
Right, yeah.
Of course!

15:43.943 --> 15:47.379
Thanks.

15:47.479 --> 15:48.814
Um...

15:50.716 --> 15:51.850
Okay, done.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.218
And I sent them to Victoria too.

15:53.319 --> 15:55.387
Oh, good.
I really appreciate that.

15:55.487 --> 15:56.588
Yeah.

15:56.689 --> 15:59.091
And I hate to do this,
but I should go,

15:59.191 --> 16:01.160
because the case
is really heating up.

16:01.260 --> 16:02.661
Darby?

16:02.761 --> 16:07.132
Um, I'd actually really like us
to have a conversation

16:07.232 --> 16:09.802
about Lucas.

16:09.902 --> 16:11.303
Oh.

16:11.403 --> 16:12.771
Okay.

16:12.871 --> 16:15.040
But we should eat first, right?

16:18.077 --> 16:20.179
Yeah!

16:20.279 --> 16:21.447
Hi!

16:21.547 --> 16:23.248
Can I take your order?
- Yes, thank you.

16:25.384 --> 16:27.319
So, what do you think?

16:27.419 --> 16:29.321
Bryn Martell would be so proud!

16:29.421 --> 16:32.291
Lindsay sent the photos
and I printed them out.

16:32.391 --> 16:34.760
- Hmm!
- And here is our mystery woman.

16:34.860 --> 16:37.129
Hmm...
Is her hair...

16:37.229 --> 16:38.998
I dunno how to say this...
bad?

16:39.098 --> 16:40.632
Yeah.

16:40.733 --> 16:42.634
I think it's a wig.
And those glasses?

16:42.735 --> 16:45.371
- Mm-hm.
- She might be in disguise.

16:45.471 --> 16:47.006
Oh!

16:47.106 --> 16:50.709
But we're still no closer to
finding out her real identity.

16:50.809 --> 16:52.444
Yes.

16:52.544 --> 16:53.846
Oh, yes we are!

16:53.946 --> 16:56.148
That is the car that tried
to run me off the road!

16:56.248 --> 16:58.217
- It is?
- Mm-hm!

16:58.317 --> 17:01.754
The license plate's obscured.
But there's this bumper sticker.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.956
It says...

17:04.056 --> 17:05.958
Here.

17:06.058 --> 17:07.493
"CompanionAid."

17:08.927 --> 17:11.363
Uh, find "CompanionAid."
Oh!

17:11.463 --> 17:12.398
Oh!

17:12.498 --> 17:13.599
Here's what I found.

17:13.699 --> 17:15.868
It says it's a local
staffing agency

17:15.968 --> 17:19.371
for in-home nursing services.

17:19.471 --> 17:23.375
- Call!
- Ooh, okay.

17:23.475 --> 17:27.179
Hello, uh, this is Rory
G-Gan...

17:27.279 --> 17:28.414
O'Flanagan.

17:28.514 --> 17:31.016
Ah, top 'o the mornin' to ya!

17:31.116 --> 17:32.918
That's not good.

17:33.018 --> 17:38.290
Um... I'm just calling because
I was following one of your cars

17:38.390 --> 17:40.292
that had one of
your stickers on it.

17:40.392 --> 17:42.127
And there was a woman driving,

17:42.227 --> 17:45.397
and she went directly
through a crosswalk,

17:45.497 --> 17:46.899
striking a child dead!

17:46.999 --> 17:49.034
- No!
- Oh! Okay, no, not dead.

17:49.134 --> 17:52.004
But certainly not well.
It was just a close call.

17:52.104 --> 17:54.907
And I was wondering,
if I sent you a picture,

17:55.007 --> 17:58.177
I'm sending it right now,
would you be able to tell me

17:58.277 --> 18:01.613
if you recognize this person
as one of your employees?

18:01.713 --> 18:02.881
Have you got it?

18:02.981 --> 18:05.884
Yes, her hair's a little
different, by the way.

18:05.984 --> 18:07.252
Oh?

18:07.352 --> 18:10.122
Is that so?

18:13.892 --> 18:16.328
So, listen...

18:18.897 --> 18:22.234
I know there's a lot of history
between you and Lucas.

18:22.334 --> 18:25.170
But, like, ancient history.

18:25.270 --> 18:26.738
Stone age.

18:26.839 --> 18:30.142
We're talking
dinosaurs and meteors.

18:30.242 --> 18:35.147
For you, maybe.
But not for Lucas.

18:35.247 --> 18:37.116
When you left
all those years ago,

18:37.216 --> 18:40.119
Lucas was shattered.

18:40.219 --> 18:42.921
Mainly because
he didn't know why you...

18:43.021 --> 18:44.756
just ghosted.

18:44.857 --> 18:46.859
I mean, everything's fine now,

18:46.959 --> 18:49.628
it's just when I found him...

18:49.728 --> 18:51.730
he was still hurting.

18:51.830 --> 18:55.934
And now, suddenly
you're back in town, and...

18:56.034 --> 18:59.838
I would just hate to see him
go back to that dark place.

18:59.938 --> 19:02.341
I'm not ordering you out
of Lucas' life or anything.

19:02.441 --> 19:05.010
Oh, good.

19:05.110 --> 19:07.579
It's just your presence,

19:07.679 --> 19:09.448
it has an effect on people.

19:09.548 --> 19:13.886
And, well, it's not just Lucas'
happiness at stake anymore.

19:18.090 --> 19:21.126
I can admit I didn't really
handle things well back then.

19:21.226 --> 19:24.630
But the last thing that I
would want to do is hurt Lucas.

19:24.730 --> 19:26.231
Or come between you.

19:26.331 --> 19:28.500
Not-- not that
I'm capable of that!

19:28.600 --> 19:31.436
Obviously.

19:31.537 --> 19:33.071
Um...

19:33.172 --> 19:36.842
I wish you two
nothing but happiness,

19:36.942 --> 19:42.614
so if that means I have
to keep my distance...

19:42.714 --> 19:44.116
I will.

19:44.216 --> 19:46.718
Darby, thank you.

19:46.818 --> 19:49.555
I mean it, I do.

19:49.655 --> 19:51.723
I'm just-- oh!

19:51.823 --> 19:53.592
Oh, I'm so glad
we could clear the air.

19:53.692 --> 19:56.628
Yeah.

19:59.932 --> 20:03.969
Oh, how was lunch?

20:04.069 --> 20:08.207
Like being eaten alive by
beautiful woodland animals.

20:08.307 --> 20:09.341
Where's Rory?

20:09.441 --> 20:12.177
Uh, he's out on the sundeck, resting.

20:12.277 --> 20:14.246
Exhausted from working our case?

20:14.346 --> 20:16.348
Actually, yes.
We had a big breakthrough.

20:16.448 --> 20:18.417
It turns out that
"Francesca Diavolo"

20:18.517 --> 20:21.887
is really someone named
Carmella Da Silva,

20:21.987 --> 20:26.058
who used to work for a home-care
company called CompanionAid.

20:26.158 --> 20:27.526
- Used to?
- Mm-hm.

20:27.626 --> 20:29.328
Until she was fired
for a complaint

20:29.428 --> 20:32.397
from her past employer,
get this--

20:32.497 --> 20:34.433
Zelda Hoffman!

20:34.533 --> 20:36.735
Hmm!
Well, you figured out a lot.

20:36.835 --> 20:40.439
And it was definitely her car
that ran Rory off the road.

20:40.539 --> 20:44.243
And she went to the auction
in a disguise.

20:44.343 --> 20:46.578
Why was she there?
Why did she bid on the statue?

20:46.678 --> 20:50.616
I have no idea, but it proves
that Rory was right.

20:50.716 --> 20:52.618
You mean,
it proves you were right.

20:52.718 --> 20:56.388
Look, I'm just trying to
solve a case for our client.

20:56.488 --> 21:00.125
For our client,
or for your new partner?

21:00.225 --> 21:01.693
Is this what this is all about?

21:01.793 --> 21:04.296
You're mad at me
because I let Rory help us?

21:04.396 --> 21:05.664
Well, why wouldn't you?

21:05.764 --> 21:08.934
When he's your number one fanboy
and I'm just, what was it?

21:09.034 --> 21:14.806
"A dark, surly cypher, quick to
anger and slow to apologize"?

21:14.906 --> 21:17.809
You read my pages
without my permission?

21:17.909 --> 21:19.244
You had no right!

21:19.344 --> 21:20.579
No right?

21:20.679 --> 21:22.881
You're the one who used
her own daughter as a joke

21:22.981 --> 21:24.249
for the sake of book sales!

21:24.349 --> 21:27.853
That is not what the Clodagh
character is about, at all!

21:27.953 --> 21:31.456
Oh, Victoria,
these new pages are magnificent!

21:31.556 --> 21:34.259
And the Clodagh
character is so-- oh?

21:34.359 --> 21:36.862
You let him read it?

21:36.962 --> 21:38.163
Of course you did.

21:38.263 --> 21:39.364
Darby, please.

21:39.464 --> 21:41.800
You don't care about me
or this partnership.

21:41.900 --> 21:44.936
You're swanning around
like a real-life Bryn Martell.

21:45.037 --> 21:46.672
Do you know how
ridiculous you sound?

21:46.772 --> 21:49.441
Are you surprised that I
didn't tell you about Clodagh

21:49.541 --> 21:51.209
when this is how you react?

21:51.310 --> 21:54.513
When all you ever do
is criticize my lifestyle,

21:54.613 --> 21:56.214
my work, and my friends?

21:56.315 --> 21:57.649
At least Rory doesn't treat me

21:57.749 --> 21:59.885
like I'm some kind of
delusional idiot!

21:59.985 --> 22:01.353
Fine!

22:01.453 --> 22:03.588
I'll leave you two to it.

22:03.689 --> 22:05.624
And since you guys
have so much fun together,

22:05.724 --> 22:08.126
why don't you kill off Clodagh

22:08.226 --> 22:11.296
and make "Lory"
Bryn's new partner?

22:11.396 --> 22:16.101
Then we'll all be happy.

22:18.603 --> 22:19.004
how to push my buttons.

22:21.807 --> 22:24.009
It's the whole
Bryn Martell thing.

22:24.109 --> 22:25.243
- Mm-hm.
- It's exactly what happened

22:25.344 --> 22:26.511
after my dad died.

22:26.611 --> 22:29.181
My mom became like
a completely different person.

22:29.281 --> 22:32.551
I feel like a teenager when
I'm with my mom and I hate that.

22:32.651 --> 22:34.986
I was so angry back then.

22:35.087 --> 22:37.723
At my dad for dying.

22:37.823 --> 22:40.192
At my mom for dragging me
to Alder Bluffs,

22:40.292 --> 22:42.194
only to then abandon me
for her career.

22:42.294 --> 22:44.229
Hey, now if she
hadn't dragged you here,

22:44.329 --> 22:45.997
you never would have
met the most handsome

22:46.098 --> 22:48.333
eligible bachelor
in Alder Bluffs.

22:48.433 --> 22:50.535
Are you seriously throwing
Lucas at me right now?

22:50.635 --> 22:53.405
Hello, I'm talking about me!
Look at this jaw line!

22:53.505 --> 22:55.707
- I mean...
- Oh.

22:55.807 --> 22:57.075
That's true.

22:57.175 --> 22:59.444
Okay, well, "eligible bachelor"
no longer applies,

22:59.544 --> 23:01.813
but the rest does.

23:01.913 --> 23:03.448
Look, I-I get it.

23:03.548 --> 23:05.917
That was a rough time for you.

23:06.017 --> 23:10.021
It's why you left.

23:10.122 --> 23:12.924
Is that it, though?

23:13.024 --> 23:14.860
Is that all?

23:14.960 --> 23:19.731
Or do I run from stuff?
Do I push people away?

23:19.831 --> 23:21.733
Well... yes.

23:21.833 --> 23:23.034
Sometimes.

23:23.135 --> 23:24.803
But it makes sense.

23:24.903 --> 23:26.405
People with abandonment issues

23:26.505 --> 23:28.974
tend to do the same
to protect themselves.

23:29.074 --> 23:30.275
I knew it.

23:30.375 --> 23:31.576
I'm totally screwed up.

23:31.676 --> 23:33.745
Not totally.
Look how far you've come!

23:33.845 --> 23:36.481
Would the Darby of ten years ago
have ever imagined

23:36.581 --> 23:39.885
starting a business
with Victoria?

23:39.985 --> 23:41.153
Probably not.

23:41.253 --> 23:43.588
- I mean...
- Okay, definitely not.

23:43.688 --> 23:45.390
There we go.

23:45.490 --> 23:47.726
I hope we still have a business.

23:47.826 --> 23:49.428
I said some pretty rough stuff.

23:49.528 --> 23:52.597
How bad could it have been?
I bet she's already over it.

23:57.969 --> 23:59.104
Mm-hm-hm...

23:59.204 --> 24:01.606
Okay, Furiosa.

24:01.706 --> 24:05.510
Maybe we should take a breath
before we go and see Moira.

24:05.610 --> 24:08.313
Why?
We still have a case to solve.

24:08.413 --> 24:10.482
And if Carmella
really was Zelda's nurse,

24:10.582 --> 24:13.318
then maybe Moira
can tell us where to find her.

24:13.418 --> 24:18.723
Victoria, I love you,
and I know you're upset,

24:18.824 --> 24:21.426
but maybe you should
cut Darby some slack.

24:21.526 --> 24:23.795
What?
Why?

24:23.895 --> 24:26.531
I just think I know why
she's been acting out a tad.

24:26.631 --> 24:27.566
You do?

24:27.666 --> 24:29.501
She hasn't been
any nicer to you!

24:29.601 --> 24:31.937
Well, Darby's
a walking leather jacket.

24:32.037 --> 24:34.339
Her bark is worse than her bite.

24:34.439 --> 24:37.843
And I... I, too,
tend to overreact sometimes.

24:37.943 --> 24:40.011
Oh?
I hadn't noticed.

24:40.111 --> 24:41.980
Ha.
Yeah.

24:42.080 --> 24:44.483
I know what I'm like.

24:44.583 --> 24:47.319
I take offence when people
don't take me seriously.

24:47.419 --> 24:49.654
It's a classic
defence mechanism.

24:49.754 --> 24:51.189
And Darby's the same.

24:51.289 --> 24:53.091
Yeah, but you heard
what she said.

24:53.191 --> 24:55.227
She's the one that
doesn't take me seriously!

24:55.327 --> 24:59.264
But, uh, maybe she just
feels more comfortable

24:59.364 --> 25:02.400
pushing people away
than being vulnerable.

25:02.501 --> 25:04.102
It's this whole Clodagh thing.

25:04.202 --> 25:07.639
I clearly meant it as an homage,
not an insult!

25:07.739 --> 25:10.642
Her bravery,
her sense of justice,

25:10.742 --> 25:15.780
the way Bryn has been longing to
have Clodagh back in her life.

25:15.881 --> 25:20.185
What if Darby looked at it
and saw her own worst fears

25:20.285 --> 25:21.987
about herself?

25:22.087 --> 25:26.558
That the distance between Bryn
and Clodagh is all her fault?

25:26.658 --> 25:28.426
Well, technically,
it was the nuns' fault

25:28.527 --> 25:31.463
for lying to Bryn about
her baby dying in childbirth.

25:31.563 --> 25:32.898
Yes...

25:32.998 --> 25:35.300
Just to protect the secret
of the lost monk's treasure!

25:35.400 --> 25:36.701
Yeah.

25:36.801 --> 25:40.372
But I get your point.

25:48.046 --> 25:49.481
Moira!

25:49.581 --> 25:51.249
Sorry to pop in on you
like this.

25:51.349 --> 25:54.419
I just wanted you to meet
one of my clients, Victoria.

25:54.519 --> 25:57.389
She's interested in buying some
of the pieces that didn't sell.

25:57.489 --> 25:58.924
Now is really not a great time.

25:59.024 --> 26:01.793
We're sorry to disturb you.
I'm just such an antiques hound.

26:01.893 --> 26:04.829
I guess we'll
come back later, okay?

26:04.930 --> 26:06.431
Okay.

26:06.531 --> 26:08.199
Although...

26:08.300 --> 26:11.703
I do need to get in touch with
someone on your bidding list.

26:11.803 --> 26:13.939
She bid against me for an item.

26:14.039 --> 26:15.440
Do you have the picture?
Yeah.

26:15.540 --> 26:16.775
Do you recognize her?

26:16.875 --> 26:18.310
The one behind the cute couple.

26:18.410 --> 26:23.415
Wait a minute,
is that...?

26:23.515 --> 26:24.649
This is my mother's ex-nurse!

26:24.749 --> 26:26.418
I fired her when
I caught her stealing.

26:26.518 --> 26:27.652
She kept harassing us.

26:27.752 --> 26:29.788
I-I took out a peace bond
against her.

26:29.888 --> 26:31.323
Why is she here?
I...

26:31.423 --> 26:35.760
Donning a disguise
to sneak back in?

26:35.860 --> 26:37.195
This is like something
out of a--

26:37.295 --> 26:39.397
- A mystery novel?
- Indeed.

26:39.497 --> 26:40.865
We're so sorry to upset you.

26:40.966 --> 26:43.201
We were just trying
to find out where she is.

26:43.301 --> 26:45.303
I have no idea where she is.

26:45.403 --> 26:46.404
I see.

26:46.504 --> 26:48.607
Well, um... I...
nothing?

26:48.707 --> 26:50.508
Okay, great.

27:03.188 --> 27:05.991
Oh.

27:06.091 --> 27:09.761
Oh, I'll go make us
a great big drink.

27:14.132 --> 27:15.433
I'm sorry, Mom.

27:15.533 --> 27:16.801
What I said was really harsh.

27:16.901 --> 27:20.772
I think I was just trying to
push you away or something,

27:20.872 --> 27:24.609
because that's what I do...

27:24.709 --> 27:26.277
apparently.

27:26.378 --> 27:29.314
No, I'm sorry.

27:29.414 --> 27:31.349
I should have never
based a character on you

27:31.449 --> 27:33.418
without asking you first.

27:33.518 --> 27:37.789
But I promise you, it was
never meant it to be hurtful.

27:37.889 --> 27:39.624
You won't believe this.

27:39.724 --> 27:42.694
Carmella left me a voicemail!

27:42.794 --> 27:46.031
Rorygan O'Flanagan,
I know you have the statue.

27:46.131 --> 27:49.768
Bring it to 1177 Carlisle Street
or someone will die.

27:49.868 --> 27:52.337
Tell no one and come alone.

27:52.437 --> 27:55.173
What in God's name
is up with that statue?

28:00.111 --> 28:01.312
Hmm...

28:01.413 --> 28:05.984
It's just a cat.

28:06.084 --> 28:09.054
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

28:09.154 --> 28:10.755
I can't believe
I'm about to do this,

28:10.855 --> 28:13.024
but what is it that
Bryn Martell always says?

28:13.124 --> 28:15.894
Uh, "Vengeance is always
best served like Vichyssoise."

28:15.994 --> 28:19.230
Oh, "A woman's best weapon
is a black dress"?

28:19.330 --> 28:20.498
No.

28:20.598 --> 28:23.601
Oh, "Sometimes the wrong man
is the right answer"!

28:23.702 --> 28:27.772
"Sometimes you have to break
a few eggs to crack a case."

28:27.872 --> 28:30.542
- That's the one.
- I don't remember that one.

28:30.642 --> 28:34.045
Gah!
No!

28:34.145 --> 28:38.783
Oh, I spent $3,000 on this cat,
thank you very much!

28:40.919 --> 28:45.023
Is that what I think it is?

28:45.123 --> 28:46.758
Say, "Cheese."

28:51.129 --> 28:52.363
Well, that's Zelda.

28:52.464 --> 28:54.866
God, she looks awful.

28:58.036 --> 29:00.171
So Carmella
planted the camera?

29:00.271 --> 29:02.507
Why would someone
who's supposedly stealing

29:02.607 --> 29:04.976
from their employer
set up a secret nanny cam?

29:05.076 --> 29:07.245
Can you fast-forward a bit?

29:11.683 --> 29:13.051
Wait, stop.

29:13.151 --> 29:16.821
That's Moira.

29:16.921 --> 29:18.223
Stop.

29:18.323 --> 29:20.592
What are you giving me?

29:20.692 --> 29:22.093
Where's Carmella?

29:22.193 --> 29:24.262
Humph!
Mom, you're confused again!

29:24.362 --> 29:26.431
Carmella quit.
She couldn't handle you.

29:26.531 --> 29:29.901
That's why I had to move home
and take care of you.

29:30.001 --> 29:31.536
Not that you're grateful.

29:31.636 --> 29:35.373
No, wait, wait...

29:35.473 --> 29:38.576
Uh, maybe Carmella isn't
the bad guy here after all.

29:38.676 --> 29:40.945
Maybe she planted the camera
because she knew

29:41.045 --> 29:43.248
Moira was up to something
and wanted to keep Zelda

29:43.348 --> 29:44.449
from being put in a home.

29:44.549 --> 29:46.084
Yeah, that's why
she wanted it back.

29:46.184 --> 29:47.452
That's why she chased you.

29:47.552 --> 29:49.087
We need to talk to Carmella.

29:49.187 --> 29:50.622
Quickly.

30:13.311 --> 30:14.946
I told you to come alone!

30:15.046 --> 30:17.248
They're harmless.

30:17.348 --> 30:19.117
Except to each other.

30:23.988 --> 30:25.456
Not that you're grateful.

30:25.557 --> 30:27.392
No, wait, wait--

30:27.492 --> 30:28.393
Oh my God!

30:28.493 --> 30:30.061
This is exactly
what I was afraid of.

30:30.161 --> 30:31.162
We have to stop Moira!

30:31.262 --> 30:34.699
Tell us what happened
from the beginning.

30:34.799 --> 30:37.068
I had been working with Zelda
for over a year.

30:37.168 --> 30:38.970
We were very close.

30:39.070 --> 30:40.371
Moira was never around.

30:40.471 --> 30:42.640
She only ever called
when she wanted money.

30:42.740 --> 30:45.243
One day, she showed up
and said she was moving in.

30:45.343 --> 30:48.813
Soon after, Zelda started to
show signs of cognitive decline.

30:48.913 --> 30:52.450
It didn't make sense;
she was always sharp as a tack.

30:52.550 --> 30:54.752
That's why I set up the camera.

30:54.853 --> 30:56.087
But before I could retrieve it--

30:56.187 --> 30:58.289
Moira fired you for "stealing."

30:58.389 --> 30:59.858
Exactly.

30:59.958 --> 31:02.961
She thought I was
asking too many questions.

31:03.061 --> 31:05.263
I tried to get back
in the house to say goodbye,

31:05.363 --> 31:07.131
but then she claimed
I was harassing them

31:07.232 --> 31:08.299
and filed a peace bond.

31:08.399 --> 31:10.902
Is that when you went
to the auction in disguise?

31:11.002 --> 31:13.538
It was the only chance
to get that camera back.

31:13.638 --> 31:15.106
But you outbid me.

31:15.206 --> 31:18.443
$3,000 for something
I bought at a flea market.

31:18.543 --> 31:22.480
Well, it was a very
good reproduction...

31:22.580 --> 31:25.350
Once I heard Moira
had moved Zelda to a facility,

31:25.450 --> 31:27.118
I knew something was wrong.

31:27.218 --> 31:28.720
Zelda always said
she'd rather die

31:28.820 --> 31:30.688
before ending up
in a place like that.

31:30.788 --> 31:32.790
Why did you have to
run me off the road?

31:32.891 --> 31:33.958
I didn't!

31:34.058 --> 31:35.126
You were swerving and honking

31:35.226 --> 31:37.462
before I could
even lower my window.

31:37.562 --> 31:39.397
Well, you could have
at least come back

31:39.497 --> 31:41.799
to see if I was still alive.

31:41.900 --> 31:43.801
I heard sirens, and...

31:43.902 --> 31:45.637
with the peace bond
and everything...

31:45.737 --> 31:47.005
I'm sorry.

31:47.105 --> 31:49.707
We saw in the footage
that she's hooked up to an IV?

31:49.807 --> 31:51.109
What's in that?

31:51.209 --> 31:52.477
I have no idea.

31:52.577 --> 31:54.545
I used to give her
a daily dose of epinephrine

31:54.646 --> 31:56.547
for her low blood sugar, dehydration.

31:56.648 --> 32:00.385
That wouldn't cause
delusions or confusion.

32:00.485 --> 32:02.053
If Moira figured out
that you're onto her,

32:02.153 --> 32:04.689
you're definitely at risk.

32:08.092 --> 32:11.429
Well, I got Carmella
settled in the guest room.

32:11.529 --> 32:13.731
She's seems to be
resting comfortably.

32:13.831 --> 32:16.567
Moira said Zelda was
in a senior care home,

32:16.668 --> 32:19.003
but in order for her to be
admitted against her will,

32:19.103 --> 32:21.239
she would have been assessed
for cognitive decline, right?

32:21.339 --> 32:22.674
Yeah, but you saw the video.

32:22.774 --> 32:24.542
She could barely
put a sentence together.

32:24.642 --> 32:27.812
Yeah, but what about after the
drugs Moira gave her wore off?

32:27.912 --> 32:30.248
If Zelda was still
as sharp as Carmella says,

32:30.348 --> 32:31.816
eventually she would
have come around

32:31.916 --> 32:36.154
and said something
to the doctors.

32:36.254 --> 32:39.324
Moira realized
she couldn't send Zelda away.

32:39.424 --> 32:41.759
If she did,
her secret would be discovered.

32:41.859 --> 32:44.362
So she's kept her
in the one place she knew

32:44.462 --> 32:47.065
she'd never be found.

32:47.165 --> 32:48.433
The house.

32:48.533 --> 32:50.768
- She's still there!
- Oh!

32:50.868 --> 32:54.138
And we're gonna need
a hell of a plan to get her out.

33:04.816 --> 33:06.517
If Moira's desperate for money,

33:06.617 --> 33:10.655
maybe she'd be willing to let
Victoria and I into the house

33:10.755 --> 33:12.390
if we told her
we were interested

33:12.490 --> 33:14.025
in buying the remaining pieces.

33:14.125 --> 33:15.727
It's not just a matter
of getting in,

33:15.827 --> 33:17.895
it's a matter of
getting poor Zelda out,

33:17.996 --> 33:20.865
and it would be quite a bit
easier if she wasn't drugged.

33:20.965 --> 33:22.700
If I could get to Zelda's IV,

33:22.800 --> 33:24.969
I could identify what she's on
and counter-dose it.

33:25.069 --> 33:26.270
Hmm!

33:26.371 --> 33:28.106
Uh-uh, it's too risky
for you with the peace bond.

33:28.206 --> 33:29.774
You'll have to
tell me what to do.

33:29.874 --> 33:30.942
It's not that simple.

33:31.042 --> 33:32.410
She may need
medical supervision.

33:33.578 --> 33:35.980
Well, we do know someone
with a medical license

33:36.080 --> 33:38.216
who would probably
do anything for you, Darby.

33:38.316 --> 33:40.284
- Hm!
- It's for the good of the case!

33:40.385 --> 33:42.286
It's for Zelda!
Lindsay would understand.

33:42.387 --> 33:45.023
I'm not so sure.

33:45.123 --> 33:47.558
But it's better than
Carmella going to prison.

33:47.658 --> 33:49.894
So our current plan is:

33:49.994 --> 33:52.730
my soon-to-be-wed
ex-boyfriend and I

33:52.830 --> 33:55.800
will break into an old widow's
manor to administer

33:55.900 --> 33:59.737
a "mystery antidote" while you
distract her evil daughter,

33:59.837 --> 34:01.973
who's been suspicious of us
ever since we told her

34:02.073 --> 34:05.743
that her mother's ex-nurse snuck
into her mother's estate auction

34:05.843 --> 34:10.148
in a wig, pretending to be
someone named Francesca Diavolo.

34:10.248 --> 34:12.583
Do I have that right?

34:12.683 --> 34:14.786
As plans go,
that sounds...

34:14.886 --> 34:16.254
- 1,000% insane?
- Yes.

34:16.354 --> 34:17.889
Well, it might work!

34:17.989 --> 34:19.424
I mean, it's just like
one of your novels.

34:19.524 --> 34:21.726
That is the problem.
Darby is right.

34:21.826 --> 34:24.629
This is a real investigation
with real stakes.

34:24.729 --> 34:27.765
We have to start
treating it like that.

34:27.865 --> 34:32.603
Actually, I think Rory's right!

34:32.703 --> 34:36.074
This case has been like one
of your novels from the get-go.

34:36.174 --> 34:38.976
Which is why, and I can't
quite believe I'm saying this,

34:39.077 --> 34:41.112
I think we should be asking
ourselves not what would

34:41.212 --> 34:46.284
Darby do or Victoria,
but what would Bryn Martell do?

34:46.384 --> 34:50.188
Bryn and her daughter, Clodagh.

35:01.165 --> 35:02.667
So when you said "house call"...

35:02.767 --> 35:06.571
I know,
this looks less than--

35:06.671 --> 35:11.109
- Legal?
- Mm-hm!

35:11.209 --> 35:13.077
But I promise I wouldn't
have asked for your help

35:13.177 --> 35:16.180
if someone's life
weren't at stake.

35:16.280 --> 35:20.051
Alright, I'm here for you.

35:20.151 --> 35:23.254
But, respectfully,
I am not gonna be caught

35:23.354 --> 35:26.057
climbing through
some dowager's window.

35:26.157 --> 35:27.959
At least not first, anyway.

35:43.975 --> 35:46.577
So is there a particular
piece you're looking for, or...?

35:46.677 --> 35:47.612
Um...

35:47.712 --> 35:49.680
Oh, she'll know it
when she sees it.

35:49.780 --> 35:52.116
She has a very discerning eye.

35:52.216 --> 35:53.618
Mm-hm!

35:53.718 --> 35:55.887
Oh, you must have
so many wonderful

35:55.987 --> 35:57.855
childhood memories
in this house!

35:57.955 --> 36:01.058
Yeah, sure.
Lots and lots.

36:03.227 --> 36:07.165
Carmella said
this one is Zelda's room.

36:11.536 --> 36:15.139
Mrs. Hoffman?
Hello?

36:20.011 --> 36:21.879
Morphine sulfate.

36:21.979 --> 36:26.417
- Is that bad?
- Uh-huh.

36:26.517 --> 36:29.020
She's alive, just unconscious.

36:29.120 --> 36:32.390
Now, we can reverse the effects,
but I'll need your help.

36:32.490 --> 36:34.091
Oh!

36:35.693 --> 36:38.429
Oh my, these old houses!

36:38.529 --> 36:40.131
Mine is just the same!

36:42.200 --> 36:43.801
Speaking of which,
this is such a big house.

36:43.901 --> 36:45.770
Are you planning
on staying here?

36:45.870 --> 36:46.971
Yeah, I dunno. Maybe.

36:47.071 --> 36:48.272
Ah!

36:52.043 --> 36:53.477
Let's avoid that spot!

36:53.578 --> 36:55.446
Agreed.

37:04.055 --> 37:05.256
Everything good?

37:05.356 --> 37:07.658
- Yeah.
- You sure?

37:07.758 --> 37:09.293
Yeah!

37:09.393 --> 37:11.929
- Let's just wake her up!
- Okay.

37:12.029 --> 37:14.465
Alright, I can set up
a saline drip to swap out

37:14.565 --> 37:16.334
the morphine sulphate,
but I need you

37:16.434 --> 37:19.503
to administer the naloxone.

37:19.604 --> 37:21.439
Me?

37:21.539 --> 37:24.075
You do it!
Why can't I do the IV thing?

37:24.175 --> 37:26.477
Because I'm the one with
eight years of medical school

37:26.577 --> 37:29.013
and I only have so many hands.

37:29.113 --> 37:31.616
You still afraid of needles?

37:31.716 --> 37:34.185
Naloxone is a common
antidote for opioid overdose!

37:34.285 --> 37:36.287
Don't cops literally
have to carry that with them

37:36.387 --> 37:37.488
in case someone ODs?

37:37.588 --> 37:39.857
Yeah, but I always
made my partner do it.

37:39.957 --> 37:42.994
You'll be fine.

37:54.138 --> 37:55.873
- Okay?
- Okay.

37:55.973 --> 37:57.408
- You ready?
- Yeah.

37:57.508 --> 38:01.379
Alright.
Three, two, one...

38:04.615 --> 38:06.317
Can't blame that
on an old house!

38:06.417 --> 38:10.521
Call the police!
Get out your pen camera!

38:10.621 --> 38:13.291
Just stay still, okay?
Don't move.

38:13.391 --> 38:14.292
What?

38:14.392 --> 38:16.160
What-- what is--
what is happening?

38:16.260 --> 38:17.595
You!

38:17.695 --> 38:21.399
How could you do this to me,
you useless waste of space!

38:21.499 --> 38:22.800
How?

38:22.900 --> 38:24.835
This from the mother
who always criticized me,

38:24.935 --> 38:27.338
who never supported me,
who always hid me away

38:27.438 --> 38:28.572
from her society friends

38:28.673 --> 38:30.841
like I was some kind of
shameful secret?

38:30.941 --> 38:34.145
This from the daughter who
was never grateful for anything?

38:34.245 --> 38:37.415
You're an embarrassment
who spits in my eye!

38:37.515 --> 38:42.787
Oh, what have I done to
deserve such a wicked child?

38:42.887 --> 38:45.022
I should have killed you
when I had the chance!

38:45.122 --> 38:46.590
Whoa!

38:46.691 --> 38:47.591
Whoa, hey, hey!

38:47.692 --> 38:49.760
Say, "Cheese!"
You're on camera!

38:52.663 --> 38:55.800
I guess our relationship isn't
so dysfunctional after all.

38:55.900 --> 38:57.368
Right?

39:07.678 --> 39:10.715
I'll just be over here,
just... here.

39:10.815 --> 39:13.984
Smooth, Mom. Thanks.

39:14.085 --> 39:16.420
- Do you...
- Thanks for your help.

39:16.520 --> 39:18.622
Well, you know,
we've always made a great team.

39:18.723 --> 39:21.125
Yeah.

39:21.225 --> 39:26.230
I just think maybe our
team days are over for a while.

39:26.330 --> 39:29.200
You have a new life
now with Lindsay.

39:29.300 --> 39:32.002
And I have a new life too, with...

39:32.103 --> 39:34.038
my mother.

39:34.138 --> 39:35.339
It's not ideal,

39:35.439 --> 39:38.776
but I'm actually sort of okay
with it at the moment.

39:38.876 --> 39:41.078
And why wouldn't you be?

39:41.178 --> 39:42.947
There's no case
that the Spencer Sisters

39:43.047 --> 39:45.216
can't solve together.

39:45.316 --> 39:47.618
I can definitely see that.

39:47.718 --> 39:51.222
There's no one quite like
the Spencer women.

39:54.492 --> 39:58.729
You should have this
for evidence.

39:58.829 --> 40:01.232
See you 'round.

40:01.332 --> 40:03.267
Yeah.

40:03.367 --> 40:07.071
Thank you!

40:22.119 --> 40:26.257
Ugh, you two!
I thought I told you to--

40:26.357 --> 40:28.359
Do your job for you?
No.

40:28.459 --> 40:30.795
But we did it anyway,
so you're welcome.

40:30.895 --> 40:33.197
This is all the evidence you
should need to convict Moira

40:33.297 --> 40:35.299
of elder abuse
and forcible confinement.

40:35.399 --> 40:38.002
Should be another
slam dunk conviction,

40:38.102 --> 40:39.970
unless you want us
to report it ourselves?

40:40.070 --> 40:41.372
Wha-- no.

40:41.472 --> 40:43.741
No, no, I-I...

40:43.841 --> 40:46.377
Thank you for bringing
this to me personally.

40:46.477 --> 40:49.013
Of course.
Oh, and Detective?

40:49.113 --> 40:52.216
I think you owe
Rory here an apology.

40:52.316 --> 40:53.784
I'm-- I'm sorry, for what?

40:53.884 --> 40:55.186
For doubting him.

40:55.286 --> 40:57.221
It just seems like
the right thing to do

40:57.321 --> 40:58.689
under the circumstances,
you know?

40:58.789 --> 41:01.559
Yes!

41:01.659 --> 41:04.995
Mr. Isenor, I regret
that we weren't able to use

41:05.095 --> 41:07.231
- police resources to--
- Mm-mm!

41:07.331 --> 41:09.533
- Mm-mm!
- No, no.

41:09.633 --> 41:12.536
- Try again.
- Okay.

41:12.636 --> 41:14.738
I'm sorry.

41:14.839 --> 41:17.074
I was wrong.

41:17.174 --> 41:19.443
You were right.

41:19.543 --> 41:21.979
How very gracious of you, Detective.

41:22.079 --> 41:24.815
Okay...

41:24.915 --> 41:25.950
Good.

41:26.050 --> 41:28.018
Thank you.
I really did need that.

41:28.118 --> 41:29.320
It was our pleasure!

41:29.420 --> 41:30.521
Some of the time.

41:30.621 --> 41:32.256
Oh, all of the time!

41:32.356 --> 41:33.457
Okay!

41:33.557 --> 41:36.260
Ugh, this case!
I mean, those two?

41:36.360 --> 41:39.864
There is not enough therapy
in the world!

41:40.965 --> 41:42.066
For what it's worth, Mom,

41:42.166 --> 41:44.835
I know you weren't
actually trying to replace me.

41:44.935 --> 41:46.604
Never.

41:46.704 --> 41:48.873
I just...

41:48.973 --> 41:51.909
With Clodagh, I wanted to
get it right first, you know?

41:52.009 --> 41:55.746
I wanted to make it clear
that Clodagh was the thing

41:55.846 --> 42:00.751
that Bryn was missing all along.

42:00.851 --> 42:02.820
That she needed her.

42:02.920 --> 42:04.955
I can see that.

42:05.055 --> 42:06.090
And who knows?

42:06.190 --> 42:08.425
Maybe Clodagh will end up
feeling the same way.

42:08.526 --> 42:10.995
Does this mean I get to
keep her in the book?!

42:11.095 --> 42:12.663
- She can stay.
- Oh, yes!

42:12.763 --> 42:15.299
- You have to change her name.
- What?

42:15.399 --> 42:17.401
Ugh!
Okay... Bésame?

42:17.501 --> 42:19.470
- No.
- Um...

42:19.570 --> 42:21.805
- Italia?
- That's worse!

42:21.906 --> 42:23.140
Oh, I've got it!
Cayenne!

42:23.240 --> 42:26.243
No!
Mom, absolutely not!

42:26.343 --> 42:28.946
But you're so spicy!

42:29.046 --> 42:30.381
I like Agatha.

42:30.481 --> 42:31.916
Ugh!
No way!
