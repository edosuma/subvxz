It's not always easy to know who you are
and to be comfortable with that.

00:09.422 --> 00:11.712
Like Alice...
She still thinks she's 20.

00:14.772 --> 00:16.990
And Ernie...
He thinks he's a gangsta.

00:17.924 --> 00:21.300
And Linda... she thinks she and Veronica
can talk about their personal lives,

00:21.425 --> 00:23.774
- like girlfriends.
- Hey, girlfriend...

00:24.818 --> 00:26.249
Boss. Sir.

00:28.448 --> 00:30.696
So my boyfriend wants us
to move in together.

00:30.962 --> 00:32.552
Why would he want that?

00:32.677 --> 00:34.741
No, I mean he wants me
to move in with him.

00:34.866 --> 00:38.126
- Then where am I supposed to live?
- You're sabotaging this conversation.

00:38.251 --> 00:40.734
- Just till we get to the meeting.
- I can get it done in that time.

00:40.859 --> 00:43.834
We've been back together for 6 months.
He's a nice guy. My cat loves his dog,

00:44.002 --> 00:46.087
and he has better furniture
than I do. Done!

00:50.878 --> 00:52.510
Okay, fellas, nerd it up.

00:52.678 --> 00:54.487
We've been developing
a new search engine.

00:54.612 --> 00:56.639
And unlike language-based
search engines,

00:56.808 --> 00:59.725
this face-matching technology
uses visual recognition.

00:59.912 --> 01:01.268
Less nerd, more english.

01:01.437 --> 01:03.567
- You take an image of a person...
- Or "picture".

01:03.692 --> 01:06.774
- And scan it into a computer...
- Or "magic box".

01:07.359 --> 01:09.329
I'm not embarrassed to say,
this is helping.

01:09.695 --> 01:12.405
Now once the photo...
Like your corporate head shot...

01:12.736 --> 01:13.572
is scanned,

01:14.420 --> 01:16.569
the search engine
will find that face

01:16.694 --> 01:19.294
on every video or still image
that's ever been uploaded

01:19.419 --> 01:21.330
- onto the Internet.
- It can find the subject

01:21.498 --> 01:23.020
in a crowded stadium,

01:23.145 --> 01:25.793
in the backgroundof home movies,
security cameras, webcams.

01:26.357 --> 01:28.979
It's like having eyes everywhere,
but not in a bad way,

01:29.104 --> 01:31.924
like that time we spilled
that container full of eyes.

01:32.543 --> 01:35.636
With this technology,
we have finally defeated privacy.

01:35.804 --> 01:38.456
I just have to say,
a technology like this

01:38.581 --> 01:40.307
could have serious consequences.

01:40.896 --> 01:44.270
I mean, we are opening up
a huge can of... Awesome.

01:46.859 --> 01:50.276
Look al those pictures.
This must be how a bee sees me.

01:50.444 --> 01:53.237
There you are in the background
of some fancy restaurant.

01:53.405 --> 01:55.072
Looks like a mas getting sick.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.984
The guy died,
which is apparently what you had to do

01:58.109 --> 02:00.123
at that place to get
the waiter's attention.

02:00.248 --> 02:01.370
More, more, more!

02:04.238 --> 02:05.166
What's this?

02:06.163 --> 02:08.794
Looks like you on some kind
of stage with a... magician?

02:11.014 --> 02:14.216
Somebody must have taken this
with a phone and put it on the Internet,

02:14.384 --> 02:15.886
perhaps for our pleasure.

02:20.593 --> 02:23.429
Hey, everyone,
Linda's moving in with her boyfriend.

02:28.106 --> 02:30.792
Unless your boyfriend is
a half-naked magician,

02:31.128 --> 02:34.320
I say we stay on the topic of...
"What the hell is that?"

02:36.000 --> 02:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:44.750 --> 02:47.217
Boy, I cannot figure out
this weather.

02:47.563 --> 02:50.637
I mean, I woke up...
It looked like rain. I get to work,

02:50.964 --> 02:52.463
and you're a magician's assistant.

02:53.253 --> 02:54.503
What can I say?

02:55.003 --> 02:55.925
I love him.

02:56.360 --> 02:57.092
Who?

02:57.661 --> 02:59.428
- Mordor.
- Is that the magician?

02:59.629 --> 03:01.471
His name is Mordor.
What do you think?

03:03.433 --> 03:06.380
Eight months ago, I saw him performing
in a lounge off the vegas strip.

03:06.505 --> 03:09.063
We shared an instant
animal attraction.

03:09.767 --> 03:12.399
He invited me up on stage,
and I never left.

03:13.153 --> 03:15.986
Boy, when you undo
that bun, you really undo that bun.

03:16.639 --> 03:19.618
Now I fly to Vegas
every other weekend to perform.

03:19.945 --> 03:22.633
For those two days, I don't have
to be in charge of anything.

03:22.758 --> 03:24.308
It's a total release.

03:24.636 --> 03:26.785
All I have to do is
please the man I love

03:26.910 --> 03:29.550
and twice nightly lock him
in a watertight drum,

03:29.675 --> 03:31.001
which also pleases him.

03:31.592 --> 03:33.950
You look like you could use
a handkerchief.

03:34.075 --> 03:35.256
Here, use mine.

03:37.009 --> 03:38.575
Okay, I will get it for you.

03:41.013 --> 03:43.222
Look! It is never-ending.

03:43.515 --> 03:44.865
When will it end?

03:45.381 --> 03:46.308
Never?

03:48.266 --> 03:50.494
I always dreaded
this day would come,

03:50.619 --> 03:52.892
that people here would find out
about my other life.

03:53.017 --> 03:56.694
People are gonna have their fun
for the next couple of days,

03:56.862 --> 04:00.364
and something weird will happen, like
someone will invent carnivorous shoes,

04:00.533 --> 04:03.662
- and this whole thing will be old news.
- Ta-da! It is ended.

04:06.459 --> 04:08.674
I can't function here
if people know that

04:08.799 --> 04:12.209
twice a month I put an half an ounce
of spandex and hide a dove in my...

04:14.150 --> 04:16.588
Let's just say it's not comfortable
for me or the dove.

04:17.646 --> 04:20.021
Anyway, it would
undermine my authority.

04:20.146 --> 04:21.927
So I've decided to quit the act.

04:22.273 --> 04:24.084
But what about... Odor?

04:24.209 --> 04:25.309
It's Mordor,

04:25.932 --> 04:29.442
Mordor the unforgiving,
and I just hope he understands.

04:34.598 --> 04:37.622
<i>Our new search engine
had exposed veronica's private life,</i>

04:37.747 --> 04:39.499
<i>and it was about to change Phil's.</i>

04:39.624 --> 04:42.079
Great. Here's a video
of me at the mini-mart,

04:42.204 --> 04:44.520
buying my wife some
tamp-you-know-whats.

04:46.850 --> 04:48.495
Here's me in a cowboy outfit.

04:49.312 --> 04:50.251
No way.

04:50.376 --> 04:52.290
Looks like
I'm on some kind of a ranch.

04:52.460 --> 04:55.044
And there you are riding a bull
at a rodeo.

04:55.212 --> 04:56.266
This can't be me.

04:56.391 --> 04:58.881
Why would I be on a bull
without zinc on my nose?

04:59.251 --> 05:00.402
Look at this...

05:00.527 --> 05:03.549
"Byron McNurtney wins eighth
bull riding competition."

05:04.044 --> 05:05.210
This isn't you.

05:05.566 --> 05:08.004
The search engine found someone
who looks exactly like you.

05:08.129 --> 05:11.039
Oh, my God.
This is amazing.

05:11.562 --> 05:14.067
It's like looking into some
bizarre alternate universe

05:14.192 --> 05:16.157
where I can drive a bull
and wear tall shoes

05:16.282 --> 05:18.522
with throwing stars
attached to them.

05:18.647 --> 05:20.403
Those arboots with spurs.

05:20.528 --> 05:21.528
Wild!

05:22.882 --> 05:24.949
Here he is, surrounded by women.

05:26.701 --> 05:30.322
All my life, I thought my average looks
were holding me back.

05:30.447 --> 05:32.581
How does this mcnurtney guy
do all that

05:32.706 --> 05:34.792
with the same ham hocks
and chitlins?

05:38.022 --> 05:40.340
For most people, there's a gap
between who they'd like to be

05:40.465 --> 05:42.671
and who they really are, but not me.

05:42.796 --> 05:44.926
I'm not bragging.
I just happen to know who I am.

05:45.096 --> 05:48.097
Hey, Ted, you're not seeing
anyone right now, are you?

05:48.265 --> 05:49.640
I'm totally fine with that.

05:50.247 --> 05:53.352
I heard you're moving in with Don.
I'm totally fine with that, too.

05:53.521 --> 05:56.570
Yes, I'm very happy,
and I want you to be happy.

05:56.695 --> 05:58.524
So I'm setting you up
with my friend Rebecca.

05:58.692 --> 06:01.032
She's beautiful,
and she's a veterinarian.

06:01.157 --> 06:03.558
When you meet her, if you start
trembling and pee on the floor,

06:03.683 --> 06:06.699
- she'll be okay with it.
- Well, that is my move.

06:07.300 --> 06:09.208
I don't know if I want
to meet anyone right now.

06:09.333 --> 06:11.025
I'm busy with work and with Rose.

06:11.150 --> 06:13.414
My herb garden's
finally coming together. I've got...

06:14.785 --> 06:17.876
How weird that you would show up
right at this moment.

06:18.161 --> 06:20.337
So coincidence, huh?
That's what you're going with?

06:21.903 --> 06:23.382
You must be ted.
I'm rebecca.

06:23.976 --> 06:26.708
Setting me up with your friend...
That's happening, like, right now.

06:27.012 --> 06:30.472
Apparently it is. Sorry about Linda.
She's as subtle as a weimaraner.

06:33.165 --> 06:35.853
See, that's funny because weimaraners
are high-strung dogs.

06:37.355 --> 06:39.918
And they're notorious
for setting up their friends.

06:40.043 --> 06:42.151
Sounds like they're the yentas
of the canine world.

06:44.780 --> 06:47.094
Look what's going on here.

06:48.034 --> 06:51.326
I did not major in chemistry,
but I know it when I see it.

06:52.040 --> 06:54.796
You should go out to dinner together.
How about Friday night?

06:54.921 --> 06:57.294
I can watch Rose.
Rose is his daughter.

06:59.502 --> 07:01.664
So it looks like we have two choices...
We go out Friday,

07:01.789 --> 07:03.172
or you put Linda to sleep.

07:08.541 --> 07:10.051
I don't care about your problems...

07:10.176 --> 07:12.706
<i>Doing a magic act and spending
time with the man she loved</i>

07:12.831 --> 07:14.694
<i>had been veronica's way
to relieve stress.</i>

07:14.819 --> 07:16.560
<i>Since that pressure
wasn't being relieved,</i>

07:16.728 --> 07:18.687
<i>it was coming out in other ways.</i>

07:20.097 --> 07:21.797
<i>It started harmlessly...</i>

07:24.206 --> 07:25.360
<i>But she needed more.</i>

07:31.552 --> 07:34.037
'sup, V-Ness?
I got your mail on.

07:34.162 --> 07:37.664
Looks like a shout-out from
the "c" to the "e" to the "o"!

07:37.832 --> 07:40.084
Finally she found
something that worked.

07:43.182 --> 07:44.282
There we go.

07:48.677 --> 07:51.511
<i>And for the next few days,
Veronica slapped her stress away.</i>

07:51.636 --> 07:53.722
I'll take some coffee...
anything but dutch blend.

07:54.108 --> 07:55.808
Sorry. All we have is dutch blend.

07:59.543 --> 08:01.094
Maybe just a bagel.

08:03.948 --> 08:06.485
I checked your computer,
Ms. Palmer. It can't be fixed.

08:09.188 --> 08:10.447
How about now?

08:11.735 --> 08:13.992
So people are not
loving the slapping.

08:14.161 --> 08:16.823
You think I like it... touching
all those strange faces?

08:16.948 --> 08:17.788
It's gross.

08:18.150 --> 08:20.999
Plus, you could get fired.
I mean, it is a weird-ass thing to do.

08:21.673 --> 08:23.002
Yes, Ted, I know.

08:23.127 --> 08:24.919
I shouldn't hit people on the staff.

08:25.088 --> 08:26.880
I've been hearing that
since grade school.

08:27.255 --> 08:30.213
I think you need to look
at the bigger problem here.

08:30.338 --> 08:32.368
Clearly, crawling around
a stage on all fours

08:32.493 --> 08:34.692
with a dove in your thong
has kept you from acting crazy.

08:34.890 --> 08:37.181
First of all, you're way off
on how the trick is done.

08:38.046 --> 08:41.465
Also, now that I've been exposed,
I have to choose between my two lives,

08:41.590 --> 08:43.071
and I'm choosing this one.

08:43.565 --> 08:45.364
You love Mordor.
You love working with him.

08:45.489 --> 08:48.022
You can't just throw away
a part of who you are.

08:48.634 --> 08:49.736
You know I'm right.

08:53.595 --> 08:55.742
- Don't do it.
- The hand wants what the hand wants.

08:56.073 --> 08:57.077
Don't do it.

09:00.478 --> 09:01.485
We're cool.

09:02.881 --> 09:05.262
<i>Luckily, Mordor was
in town for a big show.</i>

09:05.387 --> 09:08.796
<i>So I went to see him, hoping to get him
to call her so they'd get back together.</i>

09:08.965 --> 09:10.563
I'm not talking to that woman.

09:10.688 --> 09:13.281
I've worked for years to get a show
in this town, and when I finally do,

09:13.406 --> 09:15.929
she just disappears forever...
Like my first rabbit

09:16.350 --> 09:17.350
and my mom

09:18.058 --> 09:20.210
and everybody else who's ever
come into my life.

09:20.769 --> 09:22.180
Veronica needs you,

09:23.091 --> 09:25.602
- and I think you need her.
- What makes you so sure?

09:25.884 --> 09:27.816
Help! I'm trapped!

09:28.629 --> 09:30.068
Save me with your magic!

09:30.533 --> 09:31.987
There's a latch, remember?

09:35.019 --> 09:36.033
Sorry, Kevin.

09:36.224 --> 09:37.618
It's Mordor.

09:39.205 --> 09:42.287
Veronica told me she loves you,
and she does not love easily.

09:42.412 --> 09:45.081
She is like a portuguese
water dog in that way.

09:45.933 --> 09:48.299
I just met this cute veterinarian,
and she says things like that

09:48.424 --> 09:50.505
and then has to explain it,
like I am now.

09:50.912 --> 09:52.974
I'm sorry.
I won't call veronica.

09:53.099 --> 09:54.593
She sawed my heart in half,

09:55.787 --> 09:58.385
it wasn't one of those plastic hearts
that come in two pieces in the kit

09:58.510 --> 09:59.825
with a pair of fake legs.

10:00.166 --> 10:02.267
Damn it. I keep telling people
how my tricks are done.

10:08.968 --> 10:11.934
I'm guessing that's not you eating
sushi off that naked woman,

10:12.059 --> 10:14.154
and not just because
you're allergic to mercury.

10:14.279 --> 10:15.531
I figured it out.

10:15.938 --> 10:18.235
What's been missing
from my life is confidence.

10:18.360 --> 10:20.101
That's the only thing keeping me

10:20.503 --> 10:21.870
from being Byron Mcnurtney.

10:22.038 --> 10:23.914
- Well, then you're screwed.
- Or am i?

10:24.365 --> 10:26.776
I'm thinking confidence
may be one of those things

10:26.901 --> 10:30.566
people can't tell if you really have
or are just pretending to have,

10:30.691 --> 10:32.881
like the female orgasm.

10:33.188 --> 10:35.476
So you're saying
by just acting confident,

10:35.601 --> 10:38.351
- you can Mcnurtney-ize yourself?
- That is my theory.

10:38.911 --> 10:41.265
Well, then as men of science,
let's put it to the test.

10:41.433 --> 10:43.658
Mcnurtney's always
surrounded by women.

10:43.783 --> 10:46.478
Let's see if, using nothing
but confidence, you can attract one. 

10:46.945 --> 10:50.358
But I'm married to a woman who seethes
with both indifference

10:50.483 --> 10:52.993
- and jealousy.
- You don't have to sex the female.

10:53.118 --> 10:54.543
Just get her phone number.

10:56.237 --> 10:57.615
You talked to Mordor?

10:58.060 --> 10:59.949
How did he look?
Is he okay?

11:00.328 --> 11:02.995
Did you touch his ches
it's so hard not to.

11:03.500 --> 11:05.854
No. Linda's setting me up
with a friend of hers,

11:05.979 --> 11:08.173
so I think I'm gonna see
where that goes first.

11:08.446 --> 11:11.295
You left him right before
one of the biggest nights of his life.

11:12.479 --> 11:13.570
 He'll be fine.

11:13.872 --> 11:16.551
Listen, he needs you.
Kristi, his new assistant?

11:16.676 --> 11:19.136
She thought that abra cadabra
was a country in Europe.

11:19.304 --> 11:21.477
Kristi, the waitress
from the lounge?

11:22.557 --> 11:24.725
She's an idiot.
She could get Mordor killed.

11:25.463 --> 11:27.829
You have to be smart
to be an assistant.

11:27.954 --> 11:30.513
You have to be totally in sync
with your magician,

11:30.715 --> 11:34.026
know when to pull the wire,
slip him the key, ice his nipples.

11:35.166 --> 11:36.646
Well, after meeting Kristi,

11:36.771 --> 11:39.990
looks like Mordor's gonna have to
pick a lock with flaccid nipples.

11:42.243 --> 11:43.607
All right, damn it.

11:44.052 --> 11:45.746
I'll do the show
one last time.

11:46.501 --> 11:49.630
Only 'cause I know how important it is,
and I can't leave him hanging.

11:49.984 --> 11:52.812
Occasionally I leave him hanging,
but it's part of the act...

11:53.630 --> 11:55.112
Or sometimes fore play.

11:58.675 --> 12:01.259
So, the number for the pizza
place is on the fridge.

12:01.384 --> 12:04.428
You know how to get in touch with me,
and don't let Rose on the computer.

12:04.553 --> 12:06.292
She's grounded from the internet. 

12:06.417 --> 12:08.354
Did you see pictures
you shouldn't have?

12:08.479 --> 12:12.168
- I bought a boat!
- Not just any boat. It sleeps 12, 

12:12.481 --> 12:14.151
and we're not keeping it.

12:14.276 --> 12:17.202
Well, have fun, you two.
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

12:17.529 --> 12:20.492
There's nothing I wouldn't do.
I know. I was your roommate.

12:20.895 --> 12:22.578
All right.
You guys he fun.

12:22.703 --> 12:24.864
- Good night.
- Good night.

12:28.164 --> 12:30.082
So why aren'tyou
dating my dad?

12:31.044 --> 12:33.316
Well,
because it's complicated.

12:33.441 --> 12:35.998
Sometimes grown-ups find
themselves at different places,

12:36.123 --> 12:37.854
and they're not always
open to the...

12:37.979 --> 12:40.843
I have a boyfriend. That's why.
I don't know why I spaced on that.

12:44.058 --> 12:46.403
<i>And while I was getting
to know someone new,</i>

12:46.675 --> 12:48.963
<i>Phil was trying to be
someone new.</i>

12:49.088 --> 12:51.561
- Hello there.
- Hello.

12:51.729 --> 12:53.688
Phil Myman. Scientist.

12:54.458 --> 12:56.748
Two people behind you
in the lunch line yesterday.

12:57.123 --> 13:00.070
I trust you enjoyed
your applesauce.

13:00.568 --> 13:02.051
It was fine. Apples and sauce,

13:02.176 --> 13:05.094
- What could be bad about that?
- I'm gonna have to correct you.

13:05.219 --> 13:07.119
It's actually apples
made into sauce.

13:08.082 --> 13:09.538
So... Phone numbers.

13:09.919 --> 13:12.332
Those things
are crazy, right?

13:13.456 --> 13:14.459
Can I help you?

13:15.351 --> 13:18.630
- Do you know her phone number?
- It's the same as mine.

13:20.511 --> 13:22.349
Don't pick up when I call.

13:26.360 --> 13:28.858
- And then what happened?
- She told it was my birthday,

13:28.983 --> 13:30.984
They brought me a cake,
and they sang to me.

13:31.278 --> 13:32.436
So she's a liar.

13:32.604 --> 13:34.169
I know what you're getting at

13:34.294 --> 13:36.777
You want me to be with Linda,
but it's not gonna happen. 

13:36.902 --> 13:38.565
I have an opinion about that.

13:38.923 --> 13:40.362
It's not up to you, honey.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.529
When you call the shots,
we end up buying boats. 

13:42.882 --> 13:44.316
A boat, one time.

13:45.316 --> 13:47.367
$140,000.

13:47.843 --> 13:49.161
I think we're done here.

13:53.809 --> 13:54.998
Good morning, Lem.

13:56.164 --> 13:57.669
Oh, my god.

13:58.228 --> 14:00.547
Women, they think
just because they're stronger,

14:00.672 --> 14:02.841
- they can get away with anything.
- It wasn't a woman.

14:03.009 --> 14:06.017
- It was her boyfriend.
- Men, just because they're stronger,

14:06.142 --> 14:08.499
- they can get a...
- no, no, it was a good thing. 

14:08.624 --> 14:10.415
He saw me as a threat.

14:10.857 --> 14:13.689
I'm a scientist, Lem.
I've been a threat to humanity,

14:13.814 --> 14:16.254
the environment, even Jupiter once,
but never 

14:16.829 --> 14:18.303
to a hot girl's boyfriend.

14:19.857 --> 14:21.160
I've goose bumps.

14:21.590 --> 14:24.905
It's like this is the beginning
of a whole new Phil.

14:25.073 --> 14:28.166
Actually, no. I looked down
Byron Mcnurtney road,

14:28.291 --> 14:30.496
and it leads straight
to the emergency room.

14:31.056 --> 14:33.511
No, I've decided I'm gonna
stick with who I am.

14:35.104 --> 14:37.059
 Isn't there some
sort of middle ground?

14:37.752 --> 14:38.736
Nope

14:42.769 --> 14:45.447
- Then what happened?
- We had birthday cake

14:45.572 --> 14:47.775
and talked for a while.
Can we go to lunch now?

14:48.281 --> 14:49.936
You don't seem excited.

14:50.061 --> 14:51.897
Let me show you
what you could have.

14:52.022 --> 14:53.933
We've this search engine,
so I pulled together

14:54.058 --> 14:56.264
a bunch of stuff on Ted
for you to see.

14:57.226 --> 14:59.364
Here he is at the company
picnic playing volleyball.

14:59.759 --> 15:02.192
Look at his muscles
when he serves.

15:03.319 --> 15:06.355
And in this one, he's helping Rose
into a ride at Disneyland.

15:07.187 --> 15:08.323
Look at his face.

15:08.766 --> 15:10.136
The way he looks at her,

15:10.466 --> 15:13.481
So concerned and caring...
It just melts your heart.

15:14.485 --> 15:16.753
Oh, my god.
You're obsessed with Ted.

15:19.369 --> 15:21.419
- That's ridiculous.
- Look at you.

15:21.587 --> 15:24.214
You spend more time thinking about Ted
than you do your own boyfriend.

15:24.382 --> 15:27.551
I could focus on him if someone
would take Ted off the table.

15:28.190 --> 15:31.263
Is that why you want me to go out
with him, to make him unavailable?

15:34.605 --> 15:38.351
I just thought we'd make a great couple.
You'd make a great couple.

15:39.138 --> 15:41.695
Are we gonna stay here
all day, or are we gonna go eat lunch?

15:44.021 --> 15:47.397
To help the man she loves,
Veronica decided to do one last show.

15:47.522 --> 15:48.814
I'm here to support her.

15:48.939 --> 15:51.607
She doesn't want to get nervous,
She told me to sit in the back 

15:51.732 --> 15:54.459
Come on, let's all sit in
the front where she can see us!

15:56.912 --> 15:58.823
Oh, god.
Veronica's gonna freak out.

15:59.698 --> 16:02.288
Plus they have better seats than me,
so I'm not happy either.

16:07.697 --> 16:11.162
What are you doing backstage? Get in
here quick. You'll let the dove out.

16:13.984 --> 16:15.965
I like to let him flap
his wings a little, 

16:16.090 --> 16:18.305
tire him out before I load him in.

16:19.480 --> 16:21.730
I gotta know. What is
the last thing the dove sees?

16:22.071 --> 16:24.741
He's blindfolded.
It's better for both of us.

16:25.243 --> 16:27.362
- What do you want?
- I came to warn you

16:27.487 --> 16:29.829
so that you're not surprised
when you go on stage.

16:29.954 --> 16:32.169
- There's a lot of people from work.
- What?

16:32.539 --> 16:34.449
I can't do the show in front their. 

16:34.574 --> 16:36.849
They're just here to laugh
at me. I'm not going on.

16:38.124 --> 16:40.280
If you go out there with self-respect
and confidence,

16:40.405 --> 16:42.114
they'll be the ones who look foolish.

16:42.832 --> 16:46.129
Halfway through the act,
I drink from a large saucer of milk. 

16:47.956 --> 16:49.633
And then Mordor
and I bathe in it.

16:50.030 --> 16:52.040
The first two rows
have to wear ponchos.

16:52.165 --> 16:53.928
Listen, you have to do this.

16:55.083 --> 16:56.877
You should be true
to yourself.

16:57.002 --> 16:59.137
If you're not, it would be
like telling the guy you love

16:59.262 --> 17:01.606
that you're ashamed
of who you are together.

17:03.860 --> 17:05.970
Are you ready, Athena?
Oh, hey, Ted.

17:06.372 --> 17:08.913
Listen, if you don't mind,
Athena and I have a preshow ritual.

17:09.038 --> 17:10.750
It's kind of a prayer/sex thing.

17:10.875 --> 17:13.323
So if you could leave
or find something to read?

17:16.980 --> 17:18.494
So what's it gonna be?

17:24.954 --> 17:26.544
It's gonna be one hell of a show.

17:29.375 --> 17:31.132
And then we're gonna do
some magic.

17:37.521 --> 17:40.564
<i>The act was a side of veronica
we had never seen.</i>

17:40.966 --> 17:43.311
<i>And you totally could not tell
where she kept the dove.</i>

18:43.748 --> 18:44.681
One.

18:45.185 --> 18:45.942
Two.

18:47.120 --> 18:48.129
Three.

19:19.319 --> 19:23.226
<i>And after that night, no one
ever laughed at Veronica again.</i>

19:25.899 --> 19:28.899
Veronica,
how can you leave all this?

19:29.171 --> 19:30.549
I'm not going anywhere.

19:39.469 --> 19:42.362
<i>After that, veronica wasn't
just her old self,</i>

19:42.766 --> 19:44.268
<i>she was something better.</i>

19:44.393 --> 19:45.521
<i>She was whole.</i>

19:47.061 --> 19:49.480
Hey, V., sorry your mail's wet.

19:49.605 --> 19:52.982
I had to fish it out of
the toilet, yo crazy story.

19:56.395 --> 19:57.328
Here you go.

19:58.132 --> 19:59.948
If it happens again,
you're fired.

20:02.740 --> 20:04.536
<i>And having accepted
who he was,</i>

20:05.413 --> 20:08.144
<i>Phil said good-bye
to the rodeo not taken.</i>

20:08.891 --> 20:12.342
<i>And Linda also realized
something about herself.</i>

20:12.595 --> 20:14.317
Don, we went
over this last night.

20:14.442 --> 20:16.499
I haven't been honest
with myself.

20:16.624 --> 20:19.384
This just isn't
the right relationship for me.

20:20.674 --> 20:21.795
I'm sorry.

20:27.884 --> 20:30.683
Flowers?
What are these for?

20:31.022 --> 20:34.487
Ever since my wife left,
I have been sitting on the sidelines

20:34.612 --> 20:36.946
afraid to get back in the game,
and that's not me.

20:37.211 --> 20:39.580
You made me realize
I want to be with somebody.

20:39.824 --> 20:41.015
- You do?
- Yeah.

20:41.824 --> 20:44.075
It felt really great
to be with Rebeca,

20:44.759 --> 20:48.037
and I want to see her again.
She's smart and funny and cute.

20:49.409 --> 20:51.232
I told you guys
you'd be great together.

20:51.751 --> 20:54.261
 Anyway, thanks you're the best. 

20:59.162 --> 21:01.926
 Your mail's wet.
Crazy story! 

21:04.762 --> 21:06.670
 Yo where is my conner? 

21:07.305 --> 21:13.797
