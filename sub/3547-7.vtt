00:00.083 --> 00:02.083
<i>Previously on </i>Desperate Housewives.

00:02.166 --> 00:05.417
<i>Nora looked for trouble and found it.</i>

00:05.500 --> 00:07.625
You will never again see my husband.

00:07.709 --> 00:09.750
<i>Julie got to know Edie's nephew.</i>

00:09.834 --> 00:12.375
She couldn't take her eyes off my abs.
I felt violated.

00:12.458 --> 00:14.291
<i>Susan and Ian made plans.</i>

00:14.375 --> 00:17.375
- I'd love to go to France someday.
- Would you like to go next month?

00:17.458 --> 00:19.458
<i>Gabrielle and Carlos reunited.</i>

00:19.542 --> 00:20.625
It's been a long time.

00:20.709 --> 00:22.458
<i>And dinner with the Bigsbys...</i>

00:22.542 --> 00:25.667
That's the police report
that Alma filed after Orson hit her.

00:25.750 --> 00:27.625
<i>...was full of surprises.</i>

00:27.709 --> 00:30.125
I'm going through something.
I had an affair.

00:41.875 --> 00:46.208
<i>It was supposed to be an ordinary day</i>
<i>for Carolyn Bigsby.</i>

00:46.834 --> 00:49.750
<i>She had planned</i>
<i>to bake her husband a strudel,</i>

00:50.333 --> 00:52.125
<i>give her dog a bath,</i>

00:53.000 --> 00:55.417
<i>and water her African violets.</i>

00:56.709 --> 01:00.166
<i>Yes, Carolyn had planned</i>
<i>to do all sorts of things</i>

01:00.250 --> 01:03.041
<i>she thought mattered.</i>

01:03.125 --> 01:06.542
<i>But earlier that day,</i>
<i>a woman who wasn't her friend</i>

01:06.625 --> 01:10.125
<i>told Carolyn something</i>
<i>she wasn't supposed to hear.</i>

01:12.709 --> 01:14.458
<i>From that moment on,</i>

01:14.542 --> 01:19.000
<i>Carolyn felt nothing</i>
<i>really mattered any more.</i>

01:23.959 --> 01:26.583
- Hello, Carolyn.
- Yeah, hey, how are you?

01:36.166 --> 01:39.125
Carolyn, what are you doing here?

01:39.208 --> 01:40.667
I've been thinking, Harvey,

01:40.750 --> 01:42.917
that if you love
this Monique woman so much,

01:43.000 --> 01:44.792
maybe you should be with her.

01:44.875 --> 01:47.333
For God's sake, Carolyn, she's dead.

01:47.417 --> 01:49.083
Yeah, I know.

01:56.583 --> 02:00.917
<i>Yes, Carolyn Bigsby had planned on it</i>
<i>being an ordinary day.</i>

02:01.000 --> 02:04.458
Harvey, you come out of there, damn it.

02:04.750 --> 02:07.083
<i>But as every housewife knows...</i>

02:07.709 --> 02:09.959
Down. Nobody goes anywhere.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.875
<i>...plans change.</i>

02:22.792 --> 02:26.000
<i>Lynette Scavo had a dream last night.</i>

02:27.166 --> 02:30.083
<i>It was one</i>
<i>she'd had many times before.</i>

02:32.500 --> 02:35.500
<i>She dreamt</i>
<i>of the last time she saw me</i>

02:39.125 --> 02:41.625
<i>and of the last time we spoke.</i>

02:42.709 --> 02:46.959
Hey, Mary Alice! Are you okay?

02:48.583 --> 02:51.917
Yes, thank you. I'm fine.

02:59.959 --> 03:02.750
Okay. See you later.

03:04.458 --> 03:07.291
<i>It was still hard for Lynette to accept</i>

03:07.375 --> 03:11.333
<i>that this unremarkable exchange</i>
<i>had been our last,</i>

03:12.333 --> 03:16.625
<i>or that moments later</i>
<i>I would enter my house</i>

03:16.709 --> 03:19.208
<i>and put a bullet through my brain.</i>

03:32.709 --> 03:35.333
I had the Mary Alice dream
again last night.

03:35.417 --> 03:36.583
Oh, hon, again?

03:36.667 --> 03:39.208
I haven't had it for months.
I don't know why it came back.

03:39.291 --> 03:41.208
Well, somebody
just bought her old house.

03:41.291 --> 03:42.625
Maybe that triggered something.

03:42.709 --> 03:44.583
It was awful, as always.

03:44.667 --> 03:47.625
I saw she was in pain
and I just walked away.

03:47.709 --> 03:51.417
- There was nothing you could do.
- And that's what I did, nothing.

03:56.125 --> 03:58.417
Hey, is that the new neighbour?

04:00.250 --> 04:03.166
- He's cute.
- Edie said he's a bachelor.

04:03.250 --> 04:05.834
- Keep talking.
- Who lives with his invalid sister.

04:05.917 --> 04:07.583
You can stop now.

04:09.333 --> 04:11.083
Should we go introduce ourselves?

04:11.166 --> 04:14.333
Yeah. Let's give him the scoop
on the neighbourhood.

04:14.417 --> 04:18.166
Do you think he knows Mary Alice
shot herself in his living room?

04:19.250 --> 04:22.542
Then again, he probably wants
some time to unpack.

04:28.959 --> 04:30.750
Orson, if you have a moment,

04:30.834 --> 04:32.583
there's something
I'd like your thoughts on.

04:32.667 --> 04:36.166
Certainly. What is it,
a menu for our holiday open house?

04:36.250 --> 04:40.125
No! It's a police report
from the night you beat your first wife.

04:41.542 --> 04:43.583
I'm still working on the menu.

04:46.667 --> 04:48.750
I assure you, I did not beat my wife.

04:48.834 --> 04:50.959
She suffered these injuries in a fall.

04:51.041 --> 04:53.417
- Well, how did she fall?
- I pushed her.

04:54.291 --> 04:56.709
It was self-defence. She attacked me.

04:56.792 --> 04:58.500
Why would she attack you?

04:58.583 --> 05:01.083
She spilled some red wine
on a white tablecloth.

05:01.166 --> 05:02.875
She was trying to clean it up
with dish soap.

05:02.959 --> 05:04.333
When I pointed out her mistake,

05:04.417 --> 05:06.208
she started screaming,
"Shut up! Shut up!"

05:06.291 --> 05:08.875
and striking me repeatedly
with a sautÃ© pan.

05:11.250 --> 05:15.125
Look, the police dropped the charges.

05:15.208 --> 05:18.709
- Where did you get this?
- Carolyn.

05:18.792 --> 05:21.458
Well, of course. Who else?

05:21.542 --> 05:23.542
If she paid this much attention
to her own marriage

05:23.625 --> 05:26.166
maybe Harvey wouldn't have
cheated on her.

05:26.250 --> 05:28.125
- Harvey cheated?
- Yes!

05:28.208 --> 05:30.917
With some flight attendant
named Monique.

05:32.917 --> 05:36.875
Darling, I could never strike a woman.

05:39.083 --> 05:41.709
Well, you do believe me, don't you?

05:45.125 --> 05:48.375
All right. I accept your explanation.

05:49.792 --> 05:53.291
I just wish there were fewer things
for you to explain.

05:55.792 --> 05:57.166
By the way,

05:57.250 --> 06:00.875
to remove a red wine stain
you sprinkle salt to absorb it.

06:00.959 --> 06:04.667
That's just what I was saying to Alma
when she clocked me!

06:10.875 --> 06:13.625
Whoa, what fresh hell is this?

06:13.750 --> 06:16.709
- Hey, Tom?
- Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

06:16.792 --> 06:19.041
You've stepped onto my property
and you've talked to Tom.

06:19.125 --> 06:20.542
That's two rules you've broken,

06:20.625 --> 06:23.208
and I'm not sure
that top doesn't make three.

06:23.291 --> 06:26.166
Would you tell your lunatic wife
I'm not talking to her?

06:26.250 --> 06:27.333
You're the lunatic
if you think I'm letting

06:27.417 --> 06:28.291
you anywhere near my husband.

06:28.375 --> 06:30.834
Just drop Kayla off and go.

06:30.917 --> 06:33.208
Kayla won't be visiting today.

06:33.291 --> 06:34.959
We're moving,

06:35.041 --> 06:37.834
and here's where you can send
the child support.

06:43.083 --> 06:44.458
Mexico?

06:44.542 --> 06:48.041
An old friend of mine
got me a sweet job

06:48.125 --> 06:50.417
dancing at a nightclub in Tijuana.

06:50.500 --> 06:52.083
Great. And you're taking Kayla?

06:52.166 --> 06:53.500
Thank your wife.

06:53.583 --> 06:57.250
She's been itching to get rid of us
ever since we got here.

06:57.333 --> 06:59.959
She finally got her way.

07:00.041 --> 07:02.583
Wave bye-bye to your daddy, honey.

07:04.166 --> 07:08.583
Nora, can we just talk about this?

07:08.667 --> 07:12.291
Oh, we're not allowed to talk.
Remember?

07:12.375 --> 07:13.709
She's Tom's daughter.

07:13.792 --> 07:15.583
You can't just take her
out of the country.

07:15.667 --> 07:17.166
Watch me.

07:25.625 --> 07:27.500
Does either party have anything to add

07:27.583 --> 07:30.208
before I rule on
the division of assets and alimony?

07:30.291 --> 07:34.208
No, we're confident that your ruling
will reflect the pain and suffering

07:34.291 --> 07:35.875
endured by my client.

07:35.959 --> 07:38.333
Your Honour,
does the definition of suffering

07:38.417 --> 07:41.625
encompass the seduction
of my client four days ago?

07:43.083 --> 07:44.333
Excuse me?

07:44.417 --> 07:46.000
She thought he was coming
into some money

07:46.083 --> 07:48.834
and hoped to stall the divorce
until she could claim her share.

07:48.917 --> 07:51.792
How dare you! That is a vicious lie.

07:51.875 --> 07:54.959
<i>Oh, Carlos, give it to me.</i>

07:55.041 --> 07:58.041
<i>Carlos! Yes! Yes!</i>

07:58.125 --> 07:59.667
<i>Carlos!</i>

07:59.750 --> 08:01.709
You recorded our lovemaking?

08:01.792 --> 08:03.250
It's all right here, Your Honour.

08:03.333 --> 08:07.583
When she climaxes she actually starts
screaming out dollar amounts.

08:07.667 --> 08:11.250
Mrs Solis, would you like to respond?

08:11.333 --> 08:14.959
As a matter of fact,
I do have a few thoughts.

08:15.041 --> 08:17.166
Carlos, you're a dead man.
You hear me?

08:17.250 --> 08:19.875
Oh, the ruling seems fair to me.
You get the house.

08:19.959 --> 08:21.667
I just get everything in it.

08:21.750 --> 08:23.458
I said dead!

08:23.542 --> 08:26.291
No alimony. That's a drag.

08:26.375 --> 08:27.792
But, hey, you like to work, right?

08:27.875 --> 08:29.458
Come on!
Just give me one clean shot at him.

08:29.542 --> 08:31.709
I'm willing to do the time!

08:35.417 --> 08:38.083
Mom, I was packing your suitcase,
and you're totally out of toothpaste.

08:38.166 --> 08:41.542
Do you want me to go to the store
and get some?

08:41.625 --> 08:45.250
- What is this?
- Oh, it was Austin's, okay?

08:45.333 --> 08:47.583
Edie's nephew?
Since when are you friends with him?

08:47.667 --> 08:50.625
We are not friends. I was tutoring him.
He brought beer.

08:50.709 --> 08:52.959
I told him to throw it out and he did.
End of storey.

08:53.041 --> 08:54.625
Did you have any?

08:56.834 --> 08:58.959
I cannot believe your timing.

08:59.041 --> 09:00.417
I'm about to fly off to Paris

09:00.500 --> 09:02.959
and you're inviting boys over
for Oktoberfest.

09:03.041 --> 09:04.709
That's it.
Go to your room and finish packing.

09:04.792 --> 09:06.000
This conversation's over.

09:06.083 --> 09:08.208
Last time I checked, I was the parent.

09:08.291 --> 09:10.208
Yeah, well, the last time I checked,
I was the daughter

09:10.291 --> 09:12.375
who never gave you any reason
to doubt her.

09:12.458 --> 09:14.625
- Okay, I didn't...
- Don't play the parent card with me.

09:14.709 --> 09:16.208
I just finished packing your suitcase,

09:16.291 --> 09:19.000
doing your laundry
and balancing your chequebook.

09:19.083 --> 09:22.083
And now I'm going to the store
to buy your toothpaste.

09:22.917 --> 09:26.792
Well, a simple "No, I didn't drink
any beer" would have sufficed.

09:32.500 --> 09:36.250
Bree, you haven't returned
any of my calls. I've been worried.

09:36.333 --> 09:38.417
Have you told the wife beater
you're leaving him yet?

09:38.500 --> 09:39.959
Sorry, no.

09:40.041 --> 09:42.750
Turns out he has an explanation
for the police report.

09:42.834 --> 09:45.750
Oh, come on. There's never
a good reason for hitting a woman.

09:45.834 --> 09:48.500
I used to think that, too.
Then I met you.

09:48.583 --> 09:49.875
Good day.

09:49.959 --> 09:53.125
I'm trying to help you.
You're living in a fool's paradise.

09:53.208 --> 09:56.083
Well, I guess
that makes us neighbours.

09:56.166 --> 09:58.458
What's that supposed to mean?

09:58.542 --> 10:00.667
It means you should stop
worrying about my marriage

10:00.750 --> 10:02.917
and start worrying about your own.

10:14.375 --> 10:16.625
Don't play coy with me.

10:16.709 --> 10:19.000
You've got something to say,
then just say it.

10:19.083 --> 10:22.417
Okay, does the name Monique
mean anything to you?

10:29.417 --> 10:33.291
Hey, I found this site that offers
really cheap fares to Tijuana,

10:33.375 --> 10:36.250
but should I even be thinking
of going to Tijuana?

10:36.333 --> 10:37.709
It's fine with me.

10:37.792 --> 10:40.417
As soon as you figure out a way
to leave your genitals here.

10:40.500 --> 10:41.750
What are you saying, Lynette?

10:41.834 --> 10:44.250
I'm not allowed
to visit my daughter? What?

10:44.333 --> 10:47.667
See? This is exactly what she wants.

10:47.750 --> 10:51.291
She takes Kayla and I get blamed.

10:52.542 --> 10:55.208
Well, screw her. Let's sue for custody.

10:56.208 --> 10:59.792
- Full custody? You'd go for that?
- You bet I would.

10:59.875 --> 11:03.000
Kayla will be much better off
without crazy in her life.

11:03.083 --> 11:05.834
- So will we.
- I am right there with you.

11:05.917 --> 11:08.208
I just...
I never thought you'd want a fifth kid.

11:08.291 --> 11:09.542
I don't.

11:09.625 --> 11:13.583
But I didn't want the first four,
and they're starting to grow on me.

11:23.500 --> 11:26.750
Hey, look whose plastic handcuffs
got taken off.

11:27.959 --> 11:31.208
Okay, you're clearly still
a little miffed about the settlement.

11:31.291 --> 11:32.875
But come on, be fair.

11:32.959 --> 11:36.291
I did buy most of the stuff
in this house, honey.

11:47.417 --> 11:50.083
- What the hell are you doing?
- Oh, I'm helping you pack.

11:50.166 --> 11:53.041
Think of all the money
you're gonna save on bubble wrap.

11:53.125 --> 11:56.333
Hey! Do you know how much
that was worth?

11:58.458 --> 12:00.458
Do you know how much I was worth?

12:00.542 --> 12:03.333
When we met,
I was on the cover of magazines.

12:03.417 --> 12:06.959
I had a career and a future,
but I gave it all up for you.

12:07.041 --> 12:08.959
And what did I get in return?

12:09.041 --> 12:11.625
If you break one more thing,
so help me...

12:11.709 --> 12:13.834
What? What are you gonna do?

12:29.166 --> 12:31.709
Carlos, have you lost your mind?

12:31.792 --> 12:36.083
Well, you're helping me pack my stuff.
I'm helping you remodel your house.

12:39.250 --> 12:41.625
You know, I don't know about you,

12:41.709 --> 12:45.542
but I always thought there should be
a window that was right there.

12:52.291 --> 12:55.375
We could stop this right now,
or we can keep on playing.

12:55.458 --> 12:56.750
Your call.

13:07.875 --> 13:09.750
<i>Cleanup on aisle 12.</i>

13:09.792 --> 13:11.458
Toothpaste. Mouthwash.

13:11.542 --> 13:12.875
Did somebody get
an anonymous e-mail?

13:12.959 --> 13:14.875
Said the boy with
the economy-sized acne cream.

13:14.959 --> 13:17.041
There you go again,
checking out my basket.

13:17.125 --> 13:19.667
Go away. Do you know how much
trouble your stupid beer can got me in?

13:19.750 --> 13:22.917
Let me make it up to you.
I'll carry your stuff.

13:24.875 --> 13:26.166
Whatever.

13:47.917 --> 13:49.959
- Yeah?
<i>- Harvey, it's me.</i>

13:50.041 --> 13:52.333
Hey, hon, I'm in the middle
of something here. So...

13:52.417 --> 13:54.333
I know about Monique.

13:57.709 --> 14:00.041
Would you excuse me a sec, please?

14:00.125 --> 14:03.291
<i>Attention shoppers.</i>
<i>Welcome to Field's Market.</i>

14:03.375 --> 14:05.750
<i>Sign up for a rewards card today</i>
<i>and get a...</i>

14:05.834 --> 14:08.417
Look, I don't know who
you've been talking to, but...

14:08.500 --> 14:10.375
Did you love her?

14:10.458 --> 14:12.041
She was just a friend.

14:12.125 --> 14:14.458
<i>And she disappeared</i>
<i>eight months ago.</i>

14:14.542 --> 14:17.041
The police just found her body.

14:17.125 --> 14:18.834
Eight months ago? That's right.

14:18.917 --> 14:21.291
When you fell into that big depression,

14:21.375 --> 14:23.583
and I kept thinking,
"Why is Harvey so blue?

14:23.667 --> 14:26.834
"How do I cheer him up?"
That was about her, wasn't it?

14:26.917 --> 14:29.333
It's over. She's dead.

14:31.125 --> 14:35.875
But if she weren't,
who would you be with, me or her?

14:39.250 --> 14:40.792
She's dead.

14:42.709 --> 14:44.625
That'll be $12.99.

14:44.709 --> 14:46.667
I'll take your Field's card.

14:55.834 --> 14:58.291
Couldn't keep your wallet in your pants.

14:58.667 --> 15:00.166
Mr Bigsby?

15:02.750 --> 15:06.291
Look, I gotta go.

15:25.542 --> 15:26.875
Mommy, look at us!

15:26.959 --> 15:29.250
I'll look as soon as
I get back from the store.

15:29.333 --> 15:30.917
Bye, Mom!

15:37.250 --> 15:38.834
This is Edie.

15:38.917 --> 15:40.750
Yeah, I'm his aunt.

15:40.834 --> 15:42.542
He shoplifted what?

15:43.709 --> 15:46.291
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Be right there.

15:51.709 --> 15:53.834
You're still packing?
We're going to be late.

15:53.917 --> 15:55.000
No, we're fine.

15:55.083 --> 15:57.917
And besides, I can't leave until Julie
gets back with my toothpaste.

15:57.959 --> 16:01.458
We don't need it. I packed a large tube
and some dental floss.

16:01.542 --> 16:03.291
Really?

16:03.375 --> 16:05.500
Why are Americans so amazed
when the English display

16:05.583 --> 16:08.542
the slightest acquaintance
with dental hygiene?

16:08.625 --> 16:12.000
Okay. I'm gonna need some help
with this big baby.

16:14.709 --> 16:16.291
Go. Zip, zip, zip.

16:16.375 --> 16:19.875
Susan, do you really need all this?
I mean, we're not emigrating.

16:19.959 --> 16:22.250
It's my first time in Paris.
I want it to be magical.

16:22.333 --> 16:24.625
And that means accessories,
so back off.

16:24.709 --> 16:26.875
It's the fashion capital of the world.

16:26.959 --> 16:28.041
While I'm working,

16:28.125 --> 16:30.125
you can take my credit card
and buy some new things.

16:30.208 --> 16:32.542
No, no, I am not gonna
spend your money.

16:32.625 --> 16:34.625
I have an expense account.

16:34.709 --> 16:36.917
And you just tell me this now?

16:38.959 --> 16:41.542
I'll tell the driver you'll be a minute.

16:44.792 --> 16:46.250
Hello.

16:46.333 --> 16:48.417
Yes, this is her mother.

16:49.458 --> 16:50.667
What?

16:56.166 --> 16:58.792
Well, you're gonna love
the neighbourhood.

16:58.875 --> 17:00.959
- Are you all moved in?
- Pretty much.

17:01.041 --> 17:03.542
Just waiting on some
medical equipment for my sister.

17:03.625 --> 17:05.542
Oh, yeah, I heard she isn't well.

17:05.625 --> 17:08.000
- Can I ask what's wrong with her?
- Of course.

17:08.083 --> 17:11.375
Unfortunately, she has
this rare degenerative...

17:11.458 --> 17:13.792
Oh, that's rough. Excuse me.

17:16.542 --> 17:18.583
You told me you weren't
even friends with him.

17:18.667 --> 17:19.875
Now you're shoplifting together?

17:19.959 --> 17:22.875
- Mom, you know I wouldn't steal.
- Yeah, I want to believe that.

17:22.959 --> 17:25.583
But suddenly you're having boys over,
you're drinking beer...

17:25.667 --> 17:27.792
And soon she'll be listening
to that rock 'n' roll music

17:27.875 --> 17:29.834
everybody's talking about.

17:29.917 --> 17:32.333
So, how are we gonna handle this?

17:32.417 --> 17:35.125
Listen, I have somebody in the car
who's late for a plane.

17:35.208 --> 17:36.750
- Can you give me two minutes?
- Mom!

17:36.834 --> 17:39.208
I am so disappointed in you.

17:42.667 --> 17:45.458
- Hello, Carolyn.
- Yeah, hey, how are you?

17:52.250 --> 17:56.166
Look, make him work it off.
You get a free stock boy for a month.

17:56.250 --> 17:58.709
A month? It was a $10 bottle of whisky.

17:58.792 --> 18:01.041
Exactly, you weren't even
smart enough to steal the good stuff.

18:01.125 --> 18:02.834
Harvey, don't walk away.

18:03.625 --> 18:05.792
Come on. Let's sort this out.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.250
Hey, Nora, how's tricks?

18:13.333 --> 18:15.166
I thought it was your car
I saw in the lot.

18:15.250 --> 18:16.750
You're a conniving bitch.

18:16.834 --> 18:18.750
I see you've heard from our lawyer.

18:18.834 --> 18:21.750
So, it's not enough
that you run me out of town.

18:21.834 --> 18:24.458
You gotta steal my damn kid.

18:24.542 --> 18:26.333
Carolyn, what are you doing here?

18:26.417 --> 18:27.917
I've been thinking, Harvey,

18:28.000 --> 18:29.709
that if you love
this Monique woman so much...

18:29.792 --> 18:32.917
Even you have to admit
Kayla would be better off with us

18:33.000 --> 18:36.208
than in a dingy apartment
over a Tijuana strip club.

18:36.291 --> 18:39.667
Believe me, Lynette,
you do not want to screw with me.

18:39.750 --> 18:41.917
You went after my husband.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.542
If anyone should be afraid, it's you.

18:47.417 --> 18:48.917
Help!

18:49.000 --> 18:50.750
Go in! Go!

18:51.166 --> 18:52.375
Go!

18:58.417 --> 18:59.709
Harvey!

19:01.875 --> 19:04.500
Harvey, you come out of there, damn it.

19:07.500 --> 19:09.041
Down.

19:09.125 --> 19:11.000
Everybody down.

19:11.083 --> 19:12.917
Nobody goes anywhere.

19:18.500 --> 19:20.917
Don't move. Get down.

19:24.583 --> 19:29.417
You can't be serious. We have tickets.
The plane leaves in two hours.

19:29.500 --> 19:33.166
I'm sorry. I know.
Julie picked a lousy time to rebel.

19:33.250 --> 19:36.333
- I just can't fly off and ignore it.
- You're overreacting.

19:36.417 --> 19:37.583
It's an adolescent prank

19:37.667 --> 19:40.000
and you're turning it into
some great bloody crisis.

19:40.083 --> 19:43.458
You have a lot of meetings, anyway.
We'll go some other time?

19:43.542 --> 19:45.625
I can't leave Julie right now.

19:45.709 --> 19:48.875
- We'll take her with us!
- Oh, that's responsible parenting.

19:48.959 --> 19:50.125
Stealing whisky?

19:50.208 --> 19:52.291
That's it, young lady,
I'm taking you to Paris.

19:52.375 --> 19:54.083
But that's just some ruse.

19:54.166 --> 19:56.208
Once we get her on the plane,
we make her fly coach,

19:56.291 --> 19:58.750
middle seat, no mercy.

19:58.834 --> 20:00.166
I'm sorry.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.375
It won't be Paris without you.

20:06.583 --> 20:08.875
Hey. What the hell's going on?

20:08.959 --> 20:12.417
- It's Mrs Bigsby. She has a gun.
- What?

20:12.500 --> 20:14.291
I said nobody move.

20:14.375 --> 20:16.333
She's at the back.

20:17.083 --> 20:18.834
I think we can make it.

20:22.834 --> 20:24.208
Hey!

20:33.208 --> 20:36.834
Attention, shoppers, we're having
a special today on not getting shot.

20:36.917 --> 20:40.500
But it's only available
at the back of the store.

20:44.125 --> 20:46.000
Hey, how are you?

20:46.917 --> 20:49.542
Thanks for joining us. Do I know you?

20:49.625 --> 20:51.333
My son Jordan's
in your Sunday school class.

20:51.417 --> 20:53.375
Oh, he's a great little boy.

20:53.458 --> 20:57.583
So don't do anything that will make him
wake up tomorrow without a mommy.

21:01.208 --> 21:03.583
For the rest of you, hi, I'm Carolyn.

21:03.667 --> 21:05.583
I'm sorry for
putting a crimp in your day,

21:05.667 --> 21:07.667
but I'm pretty sure that my
cheating husband is in here

21:07.750 --> 21:08.875
right now, phoning the police.

21:08.959 --> 21:11.959
So I'm counting on all you folks
to help me keep them outside

21:12.041 --> 21:15.542
till Harvey and I have a chance
to talk things over.

21:16.250 --> 21:17.875
Harvey!

21:17.959 --> 21:21.125
You're inconveniencing
your customers. Get out here!

21:21.208 --> 21:23.458
Yeah, she's got hostages!

21:23.542 --> 21:26.875
Oh, my God. Austin's there and Julie!

21:26.959 --> 21:29.458
Get your ass out there
before someone gets hurt!

21:29.542 --> 21:31.792
What am I, a moron? She'll shoot me.

21:31.875 --> 21:34.792
She has got 10 innocent people
out there.

21:34.875 --> 21:37.750
Sometimes you've got to
take one for the team.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.166
- Hello?
- Hello. Sweetie, it's Mommy.

21:46.250 --> 21:49.500
- I need to talk to Daddy.
- Porter's hogging all the Legos.

21:49.583 --> 21:52.750
Tell him I said to share.
Now, put Daddy on!

21:52.834 --> 21:54.875
I did tell him!

21:54.959 --> 21:57.542
But he says he needs them all
for his robot.

21:57.625 --> 22:01.083
Put Daddy on
and I'll buy you a real robot.

22:01.166 --> 22:02.458
You will?

22:02.542 --> 22:06.667
A big one with laser beam eyes.
Now, go get Daddy.

22:06.750 --> 22:09.667
- I'm getting a real robot.
- A real robot?

22:09.750 --> 22:11.917
Come on, that's not fair.

22:17.500 --> 22:19.709
I'm having a real bad day here.

22:19.792 --> 22:22.709
Is a little cooperation too much to ask?

22:26.000 --> 22:27.083
<i>Lynette?</i>

22:27.166 --> 22:28.750
<i>Lynette?</i>

22:31.041 --> 22:33.250
No, no, it's terrible. Terrible.

22:39.959 --> 22:42.417
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me, what's going on?

22:42.500 --> 22:45.250
- There's a crazy woman with a gun.
- In there!

22:53.959 --> 22:56.792
No, no, no, stay back! Stay back!

22:56.875 --> 22:59.041
Carolyn, open up.
My daughter's inside.

22:59.125 --> 23:00.500
Sorry. Store's closed.

23:00.583 --> 23:02.250
Yeah, but there's
a crazy woman in there.

23:02.333 --> 23:03.875
Yeah, I know.

23:14.709 --> 23:17.333
- Yeah?
- Quick, turn on the TV.

23:17.417 --> 23:20.208
- It's kind of on the fritz.
- Well, turn on your radio.

23:20.291 --> 23:21.834
If only you'd come 10 minutes earlier.

23:21.917 --> 23:23.709
Some woman is shooting up
Field's Market.

23:23.792 --> 23:25.750
- She's got hostages.
- Oh, my God.

23:25.834 --> 23:29.166
Yeah, we're all watching it over
at Bree's house and...

23:34.083 --> 23:36.166
Is everything okay here?

23:36.250 --> 23:39.417
Yeah, everything's fine.
Just having a little squabble.

23:44.208 --> 23:46.083
Give us a minute.

23:46.166 --> 23:49.125
Carlos, where do you think
you're going with that?

23:50.166 --> 23:52.125
<i>Information is very thin at this time.</i>

23:52.208 --> 23:54.834
<i>We do not see anybody in the front</i>
<i>of the building at this hour...</i>

23:54.917 --> 23:56.208
Coffee's almost ready,

23:56.291 --> 23:58.375
and if you'd prefer to watch
the coverage on channel 9,

23:58.458 --> 24:00.208
it's on in the den.

24:02.083 --> 24:04.500
Orson, Greta needs a coaster.

24:04.583 --> 24:07.709
<i>We'll be keeping you posted</i>
<i>right here, live on the air.</i>

24:07.792 --> 24:11.542
- Bree, have you heard?
- Oh, it's just awful.

24:11.625 --> 24:14.709
- Devilled egg?
- Oh, thank you.

24:16.959 --> 24:19.208
I told you she'd have food.

24:27.250 --> 24:30.291
I'm sure some of you

24:30.375 --> 24:34.208
might be thinking
that this is all my fault

24:34.291 --> 24:37.333
and that I'm the bad guy here,
but I'm not. He is.

24:38.834 --> 24:42.750
Will you people stop calling me?
I'm right in the middle of something.

24:43.625 --> 24:45.583
He humiliated me.

24:45.667 --> 24:48.834
First, he cheated on me with
a stewardess named Monique.

24:48.917 --> 24:51.041
How clichÃ© is that?

24:51.125 --> 24:53.583
And then he told people about it.

24:53.667 --> 24:56.417
Now there are news trucks out there.

24:56.500 --> 24:58.792
Judy Pope's husband has an affair,
nobody finds out.

24:58.875 --> 25:01.542
Mine cheats
and they break into programming!

25:05.000 --> 25:08.583
<i>The whole town is laughing at me.</i>
<i>You hear that, Harvey?</i>

25:08.667 --> 25:10.458
I only told one person.

25:10.542 --> 25:13.208
Well, it was clearly the wrong one.

25:14.542 --> 25:16.542
I told you to stop calling me!

25:16.625 --> 25:20.000
Tish, I'm sorry.
I thought it was somebody else.

25:20.083 --> 25:23.125
Oh, my God. Was that today?
I'm so sorry.

25:23.208 --> 25:26.917
I know, Tish. Yeah, I know.
I know I volunteered for the...

25:27.000 --> 25:29.166
How can you look so calm?

25:29.250 --> 25:31.959
- Aren't you scared?
- No.

25:32.875 --> 25:35.083
Because I'm not gonna die today,

25:36.250 --> 25:38.083
and neither are you.

25:41.834 --> 25:44.208
Tish, I really don't think that I can.

25:45.834 --> 25:47.917
I'm telling you...

25:48.000 --> 25:51.458
Oh, Tish, for God's sakes.
Turn on your damn TV.

25:57.959 --> 26:00.083
Excuse me. My name is Susan Mayer.

26:00.166 --> 26:01.750
Ma'am, this is a restricted area.

26:01.834 --> 26:04.125
I would like to trade places
with one of the people inside.

26:04.208 --> 26:05.291
Don't you do that?

26:05.375 --> 26:08.250
Oh, you mean
our hostage exchange programme.

26:08.333 --> 26:10.875
Okay, you don't have to be nasty.
My daughter is inside there.

26:10.959 --> 26:14.458
Ma'am, we're doing everything
we can to get her out safely.

26:14.542 --> 26:16.166
Now, please step back.

26:27.625 --> 26:30.750
I want the perimeter locked down.
Nobody goes in, nobody goes out.

26:30.834 --> 26:33.625
And see if you can get me an open
phone line with the manager's office.

26:45.709 --> 26:49.083
<i>Attention, attention, Carolyn Bigsby.</i>

26:49.959 --> 26:51.542
Where is that coming from?

26:51.625 --> 26:54.542
<i>This is Susan Mayer again.</i>

26:54.625 --> 26:58.291
<i>First of all, I'm sorry</i>
<i>for the crazy lady remark.</i>

26:58.375 --> 27:00.917
<i>Second, I have a proposition for you.</i>

27:01.000 --> 27:02.500
Find her now!

27:02.583 --> 27:05.875
<i>Let Julie go and take me instead.</i>

27:06.959 --> 27:09.500
<i>Repeat. Take me.</i>

27:09.583 --> 27:12.375
<i>I will be a model hostage.</i>

27:12.458 --> 27:16.208
<i>If we have a deal,</i>
<i>signal by sending Julie to the...</i>

27:16.291 --> 27:17.542
Take your hands off me.

27:17.625 --> 27:20.709
<i>Carolyn, Carolyn, call my cell.</i>
<i>It's 572...</i>

27:26.917 --> 27:30.959
<i>Now, we don't know where anyone</i>
<i>is inside the building right now,</i>

27:31.041 --> 27:33.125
<i>but we are standing by,</i>
<i>waiting for information.</i>

27:33.208 --> 27:35.750
<i>I'm hoping to talk to the chief of police</i>
<i>in just a couple of minutes,</i>

27:35.834 --> 27:37.000
<i>get a few more details...</i>

27:37.083 --> 27:39.500
Andrew, would you please
get the phone?

27:43.500 --> 27:46.959
<i>Police have just released</i>
<i>the name of the hostage taker.</i>

27:47.041 --> 27:50.291
<i>It's Carolyn Bigsby,</i>
<i>wife of storeowner Harvey Bigsby.</i>

27:50.375 --> 27:53.834
<i>Harvey has informed police</i>
<i>that he is barricaded inside the store...</i>

27:53.917 --> 27:56.291
Oh, my God, Bree.
Don't you know her?

27:56.375 --> 27:58.125
Yes.

27:58.208 --> 28:00.875
I just ran into her this morning.

28:04.250 --> 28:05.667
Mom?

28:07.542 --> 28:09.834
That was Edie Britt on the phone.

28:09.917 --> 28:11.834
She's inside the market.

28:11.917 --> 28:13.583
Is she all right?

28:13.667 --> 28:16.667
Yeah. She's locked inside
the manager's office,

28:16.750 --> 28:22.333
but she said that Julie Mayer
and Mrs Scavo are with the hostages.

28:31.333 --> 28:33.291
Bree, would you mind
watching the kids?

28:33.375 --> 28:34.917
I've got a doctor's appointment

28:35.000 --> 28:38.125
and Lynette is taking her sweet time
at the market.

28:41.792 --> 28:44.417
I'm sorry, you guys having a party?

28:48.208 --> 28:50.458
<i>We continue to report live</i>
<i>on the scene</i>

28:50.542 --> 28:54.792
<i>as the hostage standoff at</i>
<i>Field's Market enters its third hour.</i>

28:54.875 --> 28:56.750
<i>According to a police spokesman,</i>

28:56.834 --> 29:00.000
<i>there has been no further contact</i>
<i>from the hostage taker.</i>

29:00.083 --> 29:02.500
<i>We continue to wait</i>
<i>for the latest information.</i>

29:02.583 --> 29:03.959
<i>No new news at this point.</i>

29:04.041 --> 29:06.917
<i>We will bring you the latest</i>
<i>as soon as it becomes available.</i>

29:13.333 --> 29:15.250
You all right?

29:15.333 --> 29:17.333
I'm fine. I'm just running out of food,

29:17.417 --> 29:20.583
and it's not as if
I can go to the grocery store.

29:20.667 --> 29:22.959
- Bree.
- Thank God I found this stale baguette

29:23.041 --> 29:25.500
so I can make bruschetta.
And there's shrimp in the freezer,

29:25.583 --> 29:28.208
so I'm gonna make my rice
and seafood dish...

29:28.291 --> 29:30.834
Bree, this is not your fault.

29:30.917 --> 29:33.125
I had to tell her.

29:33.208 --> 29:36.417
She hurt me, so I hurt her back.

29:36.500 --> 29:40.041
If anything should happen
to Julie or Lynette...

29:43.291 --> 29:47.000
- Is there anything I can do?
- You can peel a clove of garlic.

29:49.083 --> 29:50.417
Okay.

30:09.500 --> 30:11.458
I wanted kids.

30:12.583 --> 30:17.083
I wanted kids so badly,
but Harvey had two from his first wife.

30:19.333 --> 30:21.375
He said it made her fat.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.875
Harvey likes them lean.

30:25.834 --> 30:29.417
I run four miles a day.
This is my first cookie in six years.

30:29.500 --> 30:32.000
You hear that, Harvey?

30:32.125 --> 30:33.875
<i>I'm breaking my diet!</i>

30:33.959 --> 30:36.625
She's starting to lose it out there.
What do I do?

30:36.709 --> 30:39.709
Just keep her calm,
tell her you're sorry,

30:39.792 --> 30:43.083
and see if you can get her
to release the kids and old people.

30:43.166 --> 30:44.917
Okay, I'll try.

30:49.542 --> 30:54.458
Carolyn, honey, it's me, Harvey.

30:54.542 --> 30:56.417
<i>Look, I'm really sorry.</i>

30:56.500 --> 30:59.417
What I did was wrong.

30:59.500 --> 31:01.750
But I still love you a lot.

31:01.834 --> 31:03.750
Cut the crap.

31:03.834 --> 31:06.375
I had my hair done this morning.
Did you notice, huh?

31:06.458 --> 31:09.083
- Did you even notice?
<i>- Well, I was distracted.</i>

31:09.166 --> 31:11.792
You were shooting at me.

31:11.875 --> 31:13.750
Tell her to let the kids go.

31:14.333 --> 31:16.291
Who the hell was that?

31:17.500 --> 31:20.834
- You got a woman in there?
- She's a customer.

31:20.917 --> 31:22.709
Don't lie to me, Harvey!

31:22.792 --> 31:25.458
She's another one of your whores,
isn't she?

31:25.542 --> 31:27.250
<i>Oh, fantastic.</i>

31:27.333 --> 31:29.333
Carolyn, I swear.

31:29.417 --> 31:30.834
Shut up!

31:30.917 --> 31:33.667
I hope you're having a good time
in there, whore!

31:33.750 --> 31:36.208
'Cause I got a bullet for you, too.

31:46.250 --> 31:48.625
God, what a nightmare.

31:48.709 --> 31:51.375
You know what the weird part is?

31:51.458 --> 31:52.667
What?

31:54.291 --> 31:57.625
I keep thinking about
that crazy lady in the market,

31:57.709 --> 31:59.625
and I understand her.

32:01.208 --> 32:03.166
I could be her.

32:04.458 --> 32:05.792
Come on.

32:08.875 --> 32:10.875
No, I mean it.

32:10.959 --> 32:14.542
The rage that I have felt
in these past six months,

32:14.625 --> 32:16.583
if I had had a gun
in the courthouse today...

32:16.667 --> 32:18.458
You could never shoot me.

32:19.875 --> 32:23.000
I don't know
what I'm capable of any more.

32:23.083 --> 32:27.959
This divorce has turned me
into this bitter, hateful person.

32:28.041 --> 32:31.333
- And I don't like her.
- Hey, baby.

32:32.333 --> 32:36.291
For what it's worth, I don't like
who it's turned you into, either.

32:38.333 --> 32:40.959
Then let's stop being those people.

32:45.709 --> 32:46.875
Okay.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.250
Okay.

32:55.834 --> 32:58.667
Hey, just so you know,

32:59.125 --> 33:02.709
I heard the woman in there
teaches Sunday school.

33:04.667 --> 33:06.125
Oh.

33:06.208 --> 33:09.125
A Sunday school teacher
would never hurt a kid.

33:09.208 --> 33:11.291
- No way.
- Thank you.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.500
I'm sure Lynette's gonna be fine, too.

33:16.583 --> 33:18.583
Oh, I'm not worried about Lynette.

33:18.667 --> 33:21.917
Hell, with Lynette in there,
they don't even need that negotiator.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.250
You put Lynette in a room

33:23.333 --> 33:25.583
with a woman
who wants to shoot her husband,

33:25.667 --> 33:28.667
- she'll have them renewing their vows.
- Right.

33:28.750 --> 33:30.917
Lynette is very persuasive.

33:32.709 --> 33:34.750
I give it an hour, tops.

33:36.875 --> 33:40.000
We'll all be back home
eating our hamburgers.

33:42.166 --> 33:44.834
She was gonna go
to the store tomorrow,

33:44.917 --> 33:46.959
but we were out of hamburger.

33:49.709 --> 33:51.709
And I wanted hamburgers.

34:01.500 --> 34:05.041
I hope all this is giving you
a little perspective on our situation.

34:05.125 --> 34:07.208
She told us not to talk.

34:10.750 --> 34:12.542
You're thinking about your kids, right?

34:12.625 --> 34:14.875
How awful it'd be
to never see them again.

34:14.959 --> 34:17.667
Well, that's what you're asking me
to feel, but for the rest of my life.

34:17.750 --> 34:21.208
- Nora, please!
- Hey, what did I say?

34:22.667 --> 34:25.166
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. We'll be quiet.

34:25.250 --> 34:27.792
You and your friend
are really starting to bug me.

34:27.875 --> 34:29.500
She's not my friend.

34:31.417 --> 34:34.542
- She's trying to steal my kid.
- Nora, shut up!

34:34.625 --> 34:36.625
- Is that true?
- No!

34:36.709 --> 34:39.792
I... We're... We have...
We're sharing custody,

34:39.875 --> 34:42.458
and she tried
to seduce my husband, so...

34:42.542 --> 34:44.375
She put the moves on your husband?

34:44.458 --> 34:46.083
Why didn't you say so?

34:56.083 --> 34:57.208
- A gunshot!
- That was a shot.

34:57.291 --> 34:59.792
We just heard a shot fired
inside the building.

34:59.875 --> 35:01.875
A shot has been fired.

35:12.667 --> 35:15.792
I believe the phrase
you're looking for is "thank you."

35:19.792 --> 35:21.333
We just had a shot.

35:21.417 --> 35:24.625
We heard a shot fired
inside the market. As you can see,

35:24.709 --> 35:27.500
the police are responding,
taking this very seriously.

35:27.583 --> 35:29.750
We are going to just continue to stand

35:29.834 --> 35:32.458
and watch and wait
and see what happens.

35:37.500 --> 35:40.834
It was on the television at the airport.
I came as soon as I could.

35:40.917 --> 35:44.583
The last thing I said to her
was that she disappointed me.

35:45.834 --> 35:49.291
<i>Police have just confirmed</i>
<i>that a hostage has been shot.</i>

35:49.375 --> 35:52.291
<i>Repeat, a hostage has been shot.</i>

35:52.375 --> 35:55.166
<i>There's no word on the name</i>
<i>of the victim at this time,</i>

35:55.250 --> 35:57.792
<i>- but it is believed to be female.</i>
- Mrs Hodge?

35:57.875 --> 36:00.834
<i>The mood here, at the market, which</i>
<i>has been very uneasy all morning...</i>

36:00.917 --> 36:03.834
When's Mommy
gonna be back from the store?

36:08.083 --> 36:11.834
I'm sure she'll be back soon.
Why don't we go have some cookies?

36:11.917 --> 36:14.834
Mommy said we can't have cookies
before dinner.

36:14.917 --> 36:18.667
Well, I'm sure she won't mind.
Come on.

36:19.208 --> 36:20.959
Let's go. Come on.

36:22.458 --> 36:25.875
Okay, I gotta keep the pressure on
to stop the bleeding.

36:27.625 --> 36:31.417
Well, the good news is
you won't need that lawyer now.

36:31.500 --> 36:33.583
You are gonna get through this
just fine.

36:33.667 --> 36:36.875
There is a parking lot
full of ambulances out there.

36:36.959 --> 36:40.583
- You gotta let us take her out of here!
- No one's leaving.

36:41.625 --> 36:43.834
Listen to me. Lynette...

36:46.041 --> 36:48.083
- About Kayla...
- Oh, forget it. Forget it.

36:48.166 --> 36:49.333
We'll work that out later.

36:49.417 --> 36:53.500
No, I don't have later, you stupid bitch.

36:53.583 --> 36:55.375
Okay, so listen.

36:55.458 --> 36:57.208
Okay. I'm listening.

36:58.375 --> 37:02.208
Kayla was the only good thing
that I've ever done

37:02.291 --> 37:04.333
in my whole life.

37:07.333 --> 37:12.583
I need you to really take
really good care of her.

37:13.667 --> 37:15.083
Okay?

37:17.125 --> 37:18.875
I don't have all day. Come on.

37:18.959 --> 37:21.333
Yeah. Yes, I will. I will. I will.

37:21.417 --> 37:25.291
I will love her like she is my own.
I will. Nora?

37:25.375 --> 37:27.000
Nora?

37:28.125 --> 37:29.333
Nora!

37:30.458 --> 37:31.792
God!

37:38.875 --> 37:42.333
Oh, don't look at me that way.
You know you wanted her dead.

37:43.625 --> 37:45.291
How could you say that?

37:45.375 --> 37:46.917
Well, you told me
about her and your husband

37:47.000 --> 37:50.375
after I made it pretty clear
where I stand on whores.

37:50.458 --> 37:54.542
I did not want this.
Don't you dare say that I wanted this.

37:54.625 --> 37:57.333
- Shut up!
- No, I will not shut up!

37:57.417 --> 37:58.875
What's the matter with you?

37:58.959 --> 38:02.208
Have you not been paying attention?
My husband cheated on me.

38:02.291 --> 38:04.709
Who cares? Who cares?
We all have pain.

38:04.792 --> 38:07.417
Everyone in here has pain,
but we deal with it.

38:07.500 --> 38:09.583
We swallow it
and get going with our lives.

38:09.667 --> 38:12.291
What we don't do
is go around shooting strangers!

38:12.375 --> 38:13.583
She deserved it!

38:13.667 --> 38:16.291
Well, maybe you deserved
to be cheated on!

38:26.583 --> 38:30.166
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.

38:31.667 --> 38:33.500
Yeah, you shouldn't have.

40:36.792 --> 40:40.166
<i>Lynette Scavo had a dream that night.</i>

40:41.291 --> 40:44.625
<i>It was one</i>
<i>she'd had many times before.</i>

40:51.834 --> 40:55.792
Hey, Mary Alice! Are you okay?

40:57.500 --> 41:00.500
Yes, thank you. I'm fine.

41:01.083 --> 41:03.500
Okay. I'll see you later.

41:04.709 --> 41:08.625
<i>But this night something changed.</i>

41:18.083 --> 41:21.542
No, you're not. I can tell.

41:24.208 --> 41:28.250
Please, tell me what's wrong.

41:29.500 --> 41:33.166
- Let me save you.
- You can't.

41:34.625 --> 41:36.291
Why not?

41:36.375 --> 41:41.542
Sweetie, we can't prevent
what we can't predict.

41:41.625 --> 41:44.041
Isn't there anything I could do?

41:44.709 --> 41:47.333
Yes. Yes.

41:47.959 --> 41:50.500
You can enjoy this beautiful day.

41:51.667 --> 41:53.583
We get so few of them.

42:15.125 --> 42:19.041
<i>This was the last time</i>
<i>Lynette would ever dream of me.</i>

42:19.875 --> 42:23.166
<i>And for her sake, I am grateful.</i>
