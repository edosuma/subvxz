02:01.402 --> 02:02.404
-Dear Father,

02:02.536 --> 02:04.805
I'm sure you know by now

02:04.939 --> 02:08.276
I decided to leave Harvard
and travel west.

02:13.214 --> 02:15.749
I hope to find
a stronger purpose

02:15.883 --> 02:17.385
and more meaning in my life.

02:19.421 --> 02:23.491
Expand my understanding
of the world beyond Boston.

02:25.659 --> 02:27.962
It's something
that I need to do.

02:32.901 --> 02:34.568
You may not understand this...

02:37.272 --> 02:39.240
...but I hope
you can accept it.

02:44.112 --> 02:45.413
I will be back before winter.

02:48.016 --> 02:49.117
With love...

02:51.052 --> 02:51.953
...William.

03:59.420 --> 04:02.357
-Two bits extra if you
want water brought up.

04:02.489 --> 04:03.558
Be here long?

04:04.525 --> 04:05.560
-I'm not sure.

04:07.195 --> 04:09.530
Sir, do you know where
I can find a J.D. McDonald?

04:09.662 --> 04:11.765
-You here for business?
-No, sir.

04:11.899 --> 04:14.302
-Well, if you follow the road
to the end of town,

04:14.435 --> 04:16.070
you'll see his shack.

04:38.258 --> 04:39.460
-That is impressive.

04:45.466 --> 04:47.768
-That ain't nothing.

04:47.902 --> 04:49.304
You're better off chopping wood.

04:59.712 --> 05:00.881
-$4 a hide?

05:02.082 --> 05:04.152
-These ain't prime.

05:04.284 --> 05:05.652
-Says who?

05:05.786 --> 05:06.820
-The market!

05:06.955 --> 05:08.256
That's who, goddamn it!

05:09.289 --> 05:11.993
You want to be a hide man,
you ought to go do it yourself!

05:12.126 --> 05:13.928
Now, go on and kill
some more buff,

05:14.061 --> 05:15.662
or someone else will!

05:28.977 --> 05:30.611
Trudy Maloney.

05:30.744 --> 05:31.945
Ah, Maloney.

05:32.080 --> 05:33.681
Robert C. Hansen.

05:33.813 --> 05:35.717
Eva Marshall.

05:35.849 --> 05:37.018
Solomon.

05:38.818 --> 05:40.154
-Sir.

05:40.287 --> 05:41.289
-Come back tomorrow!

05:43.756 --> 05:46.426
-My name is William Andrews,
sir.

05:47.828 --> 05:49.863
I reckon you don't
remember me, huh?

05:49.998 --> 05:51.465
-Goddamn it,
if I'd remembered you,

05:51.599 --> 05:54.501
I'd have said something
when you first came in!

05:55.270 --> 05:56.904
-My --

05:57.037 --> 06:00.907
My father is Edward Andrews,
sir.

06:01.042 --> 06:03.578
He is the minister of
the Unitarian Church in Boston.

06:03.710 --> 06:06.546
We took you in
about 14 years ago.

06:06.681 --> 06:08.683
You come out looking for work.

06:08.815 --> 06:11.119
Here, I-I-I saved your letters.

06:11.251 --> 06:12.387
All of them.

06:13.820 --> 06:15.155
-Mm-hmm.

06:19.159 --> 06:20.227
Hmm.

06:21.628 --> 06:23.231
-My father spoke of you often.

06:25.566 --> 06:27.368
-I wasn't anyone
for him to speak of.

06:28.703 --> 06:30.070
-I think he admired you
because you were

06:30.203 --> 06:31.572
the only man he knew
who came out here

06:31.705 --> 06:33.073
and made a life for himself.

06:34.008 --> 06:34.841
-Hmm!

06:34.976 --> 06:36.777
That's right!

06:36.911 --> 06:38.012
That's right!

06:39.546 --> 06:41.948
I did 400,000 buffalo hides
last year,

06:42.082 --> 06:43.383
and it's just the start.

06:43.518 --> 06:45.652
I send out parties,
they bring in the hides.

06:45.787 --> 06:48.222
I plan on doing my own curing
and tanning...

06:48.356 --> 06:51.025
...right here, do it all myself!

06:51.159 --> 06:52.760
Your father's a Harvard man.

06:52.893 --> 06:54.395
Shouldn't you be in school?

06:54.529 --> 06:56.530
-I-I went,
but I'm just not interested

06:56.664 --> 06:57.465
in that kind of education.

06:57.597 --> 06:59.099
-Want a job!

06:59.233 --> 07:00.734
God knows I can't keep up!

07:00.866 --> 07:03.471
I'm already two months behind!

07:03.604 --> 07:05.606
-I didn't come out here
for that.

07:05.739 --> 07:07.075
I want --

07:07.207 --> 07:09.210
Well, what is it, boy?!

07:09.344 --> 07:11.578
-Uh...
-Spit it out, already!

07:11.712 --> 07:13.948
-I would like to see as much
of the country as I can.

07:15.049 --> 07:16.250
Get to know it?

07:16.383 --> 07:18.352
Uh, maybe you could send me out

07:18.486 --> 07:20.621
with one of your
hunting parties, sir.

07:22.522 --> 07:26.294
-Boy, I won't be responsible.

07:26.426 --> 07:29.630
You start going out
with those men, it'll ruin you.

07:29.763 --> 07:32.332
It'll get in you,
like buffalo lice.

07:32.467 --> 07:35.837
You'll be rotten
from the inside!

07:35.969 --> 07:38.138
-I'm sorry to have bothered you,
Mr. McDonald.

07:40.607 --> 07:42.008
-You got it all figured out!

07:42.143 --> 07:45.212
-No, sir, I-I don't have
anything figured out.

07:48.383 --> 07:50.150
- Hell was I?

07:50.650 --> 07:51.786
What are you talking about?

07:59.227 --> 08:01.863
-Hup, hup, hey!
Whoo!

08:26.687 --> 08:28.188
-Didn't have no business
being there in the first place.

08:43.538 --> 08:44.906
-Excuse me, sir, um,

08:45.039 --> 08:48.643
I-I believe, uh,
I saw you earlier today.

08:48.776 --> 08:49.977
-What can I do for you?

08:52.313 --> 08:54.749
-I would like to go

08:54.882 --> 08:57.385
on a hunt, sir.

09:04.058 --> 09:06.026
-Ain't no tours around here.

09:06.160 --> 09:08.429
-Not a tour.

09:08.563 --> 09:09.564
A hunt.

09:09.697 --> 09:12.300
I can be helpful and, um...

09:14.502 --> 09:15.569
-I'm listening.

09:16.971 --> 09:18.872
-...around the camp.

09:19.006 --> 09:20.374
I'm a rather quick study.

09:20.507 --> 09:21.709
Uh --

09:22.742 --> 09:24.679
-This here's Charley Hoge.

09:24.812 --> 09:26.013
He's my camp man.

09:27.381 --> 09:28.281
-Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Hoge.

09:28.415 --> 09:29.283
-Put 'er there.

09:30.718 --> 09:31.752
-Don't mind Charley, son.

09:31.886 --> 09:33.187
It's just his idea of fun.

09:34.355 --> 09:35.289
-Have a seat.

09:39.526 --> 09:40.929
-Francine'll get the drinks.

09:42.563 --> 09:43.997
-Hi.
-How do you do?

09:55.209 --> 09:57.879
-Why don't you tie up with one
of McDonald's parties?

09:58.846 --> 10:03.417
-Mr. McDonald and I
don't see it the same way.

10:03.550 --> 10:04.718
-McDonald's a crook.

10:05.988 --> 10:08.289
We do the work.
He takes all the money.

10:09.357 --> 10:11.292
I work for myself,
or I don't work.

10:12.526 --> 10:13.929
-Miller don't work for nobody.

10:14.862 --> 10:17.031
-Things are changing
around here.

10:17.698 --> 10:19.766
Used to be you could get
1,000 head

10:19.901 --> 10:21.937
in just a couple of weeks
of hunting.

10:22.971 --> 10:25.139
Now, the herds have scattered.

10:25.908 --> 10:28.242
It's getting harder
to make a real kill.

10:29.043 --> 10:32.547
But there are still places
that they can be found.

10:33.381 --> 10:34.448
-Huh.

10:37.285 --> 10:39.086
What kind of places?

10:48.930 --> 10:50.264
-I can trust you, boy?

10:51.098 --> 10:52.833
-Yes.
Yes, sir.

10:55.435 --> 10:57.638
-In the fall of '64,
I was trapping beaver

10:57.771 --> 10:59.942
up in the Colorado Territory.

11:00.074 --> 11:01.776
Took my mule
up into the mountains

11:01.910 --> 11:04.045
to find some bear,

11:04.178 --> 11:05.846
and I came upon a place
where the mountain

11:05.981 --> 11:09.283
dropped off sharp into a valley
that wound in and out.

11:10.284 --> 11:13.788
I had a feeling no man had ever
been there before.

11:17.757 --> 11:20.062
There was buffalo.

11:20.194 --> 11:23.966
Scattered all over
like a great black sea.

11:24.098 --> 11:25.968
Fall fur, but thicker
and better than a winter

11:26.100 --> 11:28.369
for all the plains grazers.

11:28.502 --> 11:29.938
Maybe 10,000 head.

11:32.040 --> 11:34.076
-That's the country
of the devil.

11:34.208 --> 11:36.209
Charley lost that hand
up in the Rockies.

11:36.343 --> 11:38.579
He -- He ain't liked
mountain country since.

11:38.713 --> 11:43.651
-Hellfire and ice.
Ain't no place for human man.

11:43.784 --> 11:45.453
-Why haven't you
gone back since?

11:46.887 --> 11:47.923
I haven't been able
to get together

11:48.055 --> 11:49.890
the right kind of party for it.

11:52.026 --> 11:54.161
-What kind, uh, do you need?

11:54.295 --> 11:56.597
-The kind where it'll be
my hunt.

11:56.731 --> 11:58.232
-Right.

11:58.366 --> 12:01.903
Could you get a party up,
this late in the year, yeah?

12:02.036 --> 12:03.838
-I could.

12:03.972 --> 12:07.009
But I need about $500
or $600 to do it.

12:09.644 --> 12:10.811
-Uh...

12:14.649 --> 12:15.983
...that's about all I got.

12:17.485 --> 12:19.387
-Now, you know

12:19.520 --> 12:21.589
McDonald's guys can go out

12:21.722 --> 12:24.959
and bring in small load
after small load,

12:25.093 --> 12:26.794
but this will be one
of the biggest hauls

12:26.928 --> 12:28.429
anyone has ever seen.

12:31.265 --> 12:33.701
A hunt like this happens once
in a lifetime.

12:43.577 --> 12:44.980
You wasting my time, son?

12:57.191 --> 12:59.060
-No. No, sir.

12:59.193 --> 13:00.661
-Good.
-Alright.

13:00.795 --> 13:02.363
Good.

13:05.232 --> 13:07.069
-Now all we need is a skinner,

13:07.201 --> 13:09.437
and we're going to need
a good one

13:09.569 --> 13:10.738
because he's going to have
to break you in.

13:14.976 --> 13:15.843
- Here's to it.

13:41.136 --> 13:42.403
-Whoo!

14:12.632 --> 14:14.136
-Mr. Andrews.

14:18.973 --> 14:20.040
Let's go.

14:28.183 --> 14:29.516
- Whoo-hoo!
- Oh!

14:43.198 --> 14:46.001
-You -- You have such
a nice place here.

14:47.668 --> 14:49.502
-I have the only rug in town.

14:53.473 --> 14:56.077
-I think you're

14:56.211 --> 14:58.612
really nice, um,

14:58.746 --> 15:02.250
and very nice-looking, uh.

15:04.351 --> 15:05.786
-Are you ashamed of me?

15:05.920 --> 15:07.088
-No, I just --

15:07.222 --> 15:09.257
I've never met a lady
like you before.

15:19.333 --> 15:20.768
-You're very young.

15:25.073 --> 15:27.473
All the men here are old
and hard.

15:27.608 --> 15:29.077
But for now, you're...

15:31.012 --> 15:32.613
...young and soft.

16:04.946 --> 16:06.047
-Huh.

16:24.832 --> 16:25.833
-Will, what's wrong?

16:30.670 --> 16:32.173
- I can't.

16:32.307 --> 16:33.406
Sorry.

16:57.864 --> 17:00.501
-Will, this here's
Fred Schneider.

17:00.633 --> 17:01.869
He's a hell of a skinner.

17:04.637 --> 17:06.374
-My God.

17:06.507 --> 17:07.741
Hello, lady.

17:07.875 --> 17:08.977
-Hello to you.

17:11.313 --> 17:12.981
-Goddamn.

17:13.114 --> 17:14.148
You're something special.

17:14.281 --> 17:15.250
-Alright, go on, now, Francine.

17:15.383 --> 17:16.217
We got some business

17:16.351 --> 17:18.053
to talk about.
-Mm-hmm.

17:18.185 --> 17:19.520
-Thank you.

17:19.653 --> 17:21.655
Where we going?

17:21.789 --> 17:23.157
-Colorado Territory.

17:25.026 --> 17:27.194
You ain't said nothing
about no mountain country.

17:27.329 --> 17:28.896
-That's what I wanted
to show you.

17:29.030 --> 17:31.498
The land's nearly level,
right up to where we're going.

17:31.632 --> 17:33.335
-It's too much of a gamble.

17:33.467 --> 17:34.702
Be gone two or three months,

17:34.835 --> 17:36.037
you might have nothing
to show for it.

17:36.171 --> 17:37.771
-Fred, I have a real herd
staked out.

17:37.906 --> 17:39.341
We won't be gone longer
than six weeks.

17:39.473 --> 17:42.043
-There's real herds 30,
40 miles from here.

17:42.177 --> 17:44.179
-Their hides are thin as paper!

17:45.512 --> 17:47.382
This will be big!

17:47.514 --> 17:50.018
Make more money than you'll know
what to do with.

17:58.826 --> 18:03.630
Well, at least I ain't
completely wasted my time.

18:03.764 --> 18:05.699
'Cause that's about
the prettiest whore I ever saw,

18:05.833 --> 18:07.435
and I've seen a good many
fucking whores.

18:07.568 --> 18:08.903
-Fred, you've worked
with me before.

18:09.037 --> 18:10.205
You know I wouldn't lead you
into something

18:10.338 --> 18:11.638
that wasn't good.
You hear me?

18:11.772 --> 18:13.074
-I know for a fact

18:13.208 --> 18:14.442
that you ain't been
out in that country

18:14.575 --> 18:15.609
for eight or nine years.

18:15.743 --> 18:17.112
Nobody else would go with you.

18:17.245 --> 18:18.579
That's the only reason
you're talking to me.

18:18.712 --> 18:20.315
-That's just fine, then.

18:20.448 --> 18:23.985
There's a couple of skinners
staying at the bunkhouse.

18:24.119 --> 18:25.753
I'll go see them in the morning.

18:27.188 --> 18:29.090
-Calm down.

18:29.224 --> 18:30.091
Goddamn.

18:34.528 --> 18:36.730
I'll do it,
but I ain't taking no shares.

18:38.366 --> 18:39.700
Taking no chances.

18:41.302 --> 18:43.171
I'll take $60 a month straight.

18:43.304 --> 18:45.106
That starts the day
we leave here

18:45.240 --> 18:47.541
and it ends the day we get back.

19:00.888 --> 19:02.090
-You think you're the first one

19:02.223 --> 19:04.426
Miller tried
to get in on this deal?

19:04.558 --> 19:06.961
He's been talking
about that herd so long,

19:07.095 --> 19:09.130
everyone thinks he made it up!

19:09.264 --> 19:10.764
You can still back out.

19:10.898 --> 19:12.599
Miller will be mad,
but he won't make no trouble.

19:12.733 --> 19:14.102
He's a damn good hunter...

19:14.235 --> 19:15.270
...but he's never
had a big kill.

19:15.403 --> 19:16.637
-But -- But I've given him

19:16.770 --> 19:17.972
my word.
-Christ! I'll send you out

19:18.106 --> 19:19.474
with one of my parties.

19:19.606 --> 19:22.343
You won't be gone more
than three, four days!

19:22.477 --> 19:23.677
-No, no, thank you, sir.

19:23.811 --> 19:25.346
I just wanted
to let you know my plans.

19:26.613 --> 19:28.383
-You don't listen to a word
a man says.

20:15.230 --> 20:16.231
-Wow!

20:16.364 --> 20:17.731
Look at that!

20:17.865 --> 20:19.033
Amazing!

20:19.167 --> 20:21.169
-That's just a little,
itty-bitty herd.

20:21.302 --> 20:23.905
Ain't never seen a herd
so little in the old days.

20:25.306 --> 20:27.575
-I've stood in a place
like this.

20:27.708 --> 20:30.111
All you could see was black.

20:30.245 --> 20:32.914
A hundred thousand buffalo,
packed in so tight,

20:33.047 --> 20:34.882
you could walk on their backs.

20:35.016 --> 20:37.085
You'll see them again,
like we used to.

20:38.386 --> 20:40.321
-I ain't got my hopes
up too high.

21:00.041 --> 21:02.410
Hard up.

21:02.544 --> 21:04.512
-That was before
you found the Lord.

21:05.879 --> 21:07.081
-I'm going to go back
to the wagon

21:07.215 --> 21:08.715
and blow my fucking brains out.

21:11.119 --> 21:12.886
What you got there
is saddle rot.

21:14.022 --> 21:16.591
You better let it have some air.

21:16.723 --> 21:17.992
That'll creep up to your balls,

21:18.126 --> 21:20.228
make 'em swell like grapefruits.
No bullshit.

21:24.465 --> 21:26.201
-It'll take
some getting used to.

21:28.735 --> 21:30.804
Couple days of riding,
you'll be alright.

21:34.875 --> 21:35.944
-What's that?

21:39.914 --> 21:42.450
-Buffalo hunters.

21:42.584 --> 21:44.885
Probably one
of McDonald's outfits.

21:46.087 --> 21:47.188
They're going too fast.

21:47.322 --> 21:49.756
Can't have many hides.

21:49.890 --> 21:51.858
Ain't worth a damn.

21:51.993 --> 21:54.761
Nothing out here but stragglers.

21:54.895 --> 21:55.964
Worthless living.

22:00.335 --> 22:03.972
-If all you got's stragglers,

22:04.105 --> 22:05.907
then you hunt the stragglers,
don't you?

22:09.810 --> 22:12.879
-♪ I went upon a spree ♪

22:13.014 --> 22:15.483
♪ With money at last,
I spent it fast ♪

22:15.617 --> 22:18.953
♪ And got drunk
as drunk can be ♪

22:19.087 --> 22:22.323
♪ And when me money
all was gone ♪

22:56.457 --> 22:57.325
-Where are we going?

22:57.458 --> 22:58.493
-Leaving the trail.

22:59.860 --> 23:01.562
-If you want to resupply,
how are we going to do that,

23:01.696 --> 23:02.896
if not at Fort Wallace?

23:03.031 --> 23:04.532
-There's a new outpost
in the foothills.

23:04.666 --> 23:05.899
-That's Indian Country
to the north.

23:06.034 --> 23:07.568
You're going to cut us
right through it!

23:07.702 --> 23:09.904
-That's a fact, Fred,
but there's no way around it.

23:11.539 --> 23:13.741
- Son of a bitch.

23:13.874 --> 23:15.209
He's going to get us killed.

23:35.029 --> 23:36.230
-My father's a minister.

23:39.434 --> 23:41.035
-Well, I'll be, boy.

23:42.670 --> 23:46.441
I was saved by a traveling
preacher in Kansas City.

23:49.277 --> 23:51.412
-There's the outpost,
straight ahead.

23:52.914 --> 23:54.382
-He's the one
who gave me the Book,

23:54.515 --> 23:57.452
opened me up to God,
and kept me from the devil.

23:58.852 --> 24:01.122
So, you're a God-fearing man
yourself.

24:04.125 --> 24:05.093
-Why fear God?

24:19.607 --> 24:20.708
-You don't know?

24:22.710 --> 24:23.978
I guess you don't know.

24:25.213 --> 24:26.280
You'll see.

24:27.482 --> 24:28.983
You'll see.

24:52.840 --> 24:55.810
- They cut the poor
bastard's balls off.

25:00.748 --> 25:02.250
-They don't like hunters.

25:04.452 --> 25:06.087
Savages.

25:08.523 --> 25:10.391
-You wanted Indians,
here's your Indians.

26:00.541 --> 26:02.043
-We need water.

26:02.176 --> 26:04.011
-We're low ourselves.

26:04.145 --> 26:06.915
Where you folks come from?

26:07.048 --> 26:08.349
-We're lost.

26:10.651 --> 26:12.820
We got separated from our party.

26:13.855 --> 26:15.456
-They don't look well.
-Should've known the land

26:15.590 --> 26:17.024
before heading out.

26:17.158 --> 26:18.259
-We need help.

26:18.392 --> 26:19.962
-I don't mind.

26:20.094 --> 26:21.629
-Stop.
-Please.

26:21.762 --> 26:24.065
-Head south here till you hit
the Smokey Hill Trail.

26:24.198 --> 26:26.634
Fort Wallace is 60 miles west.

26:26.767 --> 26:29.604
Get your hands off that rifle.

26:29.737 --> 26:30.838
Will.

26:33.942 --> 26:36.744
-God ain't got no mercy
for the foolhardy.

26:56.597 --> 26:57.765
-Where we going, Miller?

26:58.399 --> 26:59.935
-North.

27:00.067 --> 27:02.303
We're bound to hit water tonight
or early in the morning.

27:02.436 --> 27:03.906
-Shit, this is a big country
out here.

27:04.038 --> 27:05.974
We're not bound to do anything.

27:06.107 --> 27:07.808
How long has it been
since you was out here?

27:07.943 --> 27:11.045
-There's water for a body
who knows where it is, Fred.

27:12.713 --> 27:14.917
-It ain't too late
to turn south.

27:15.049 --> 27:17.251
Day, day and a half,
we'll run into the Arkansas.

27:17.385 --> 27:18.486
-That'd put us
more than a week off.

27:18.619 --> 27:19.654
I know this country, Fred.

27:19.787 --> 27:20.888
-You don't know it so well,

27:21.023 --> 27:22.790
you don't get lost in it,
do you?

27:22.925 --> 27:24.258
Goddamn it.

27:24.392 --> 27:25.860
I got half a mind
to cut outta here on my own.

27:25.994 --> 27:27.662
We're damn near out of water.
-You won't make it.

27:27.795 --> 27:29.031
You don't know this country.

27:29.163 --> 27:30.464
Now, there's no need
to get in a panic.

27:30.598 --> 27:31.967
I'll get you water.
I'll get you water,

27:32.099 --> 27:33.701
if I have to dig for it myself.

27:33.834 --> 27:35.202
-Will!

27:35.336 --> 27:37.505
What do you say?
It's your money.

27:37.638 --> 27:38.506
-We made it this far.

27:38.639 --> 27:39.942
L-Let's stick with Miller.

27:40.074 --> 27:41.142
-Come on.

27:45.279 --> 27:49.150
-You don't look like you ever
been thirsty a day in your life.

27:49.283 --> 27:50.551
Not real thirsty.

28:54.348 --> 28:56.884
You ain't hoping to find water
like that, I hope.

29:12.199 --> 29:13.601
- Okay.

29:13.734 --> 29:15.870
Okay, okay.

29:20.108 --> 29:21.709
Keep the swelling down.

29:21.842 --> 29:23.744
-I don't think they'll last
another day.

29:27.181 --> 29:30.284
-Let's get the animals moving.

29:30.418 --> 29:32.087
We stop now,

29:32.219 --> 29:34.089
we'll never start again.

29:34.255 --> 29:35.289
- We're not going
to make it another day

29:35.423 --> 29:37.324
unless we find water.

30:07.788 --> 30:09.323
Miller!

30:38.954 --> 30:39.854
Why fear God?

30:45.927 --> 30:47.963
I hope to find
a stronger purpose...

30:48.096 --> 30:49.131
Miller!
...meaning...

30:49.263 --> 30:50.232
in my life.

30:50.364 --> 30:51.599
-Miller!

30:53.367 --> 30:55.402
-You'll see.

30:55.536 --> 30:57.038
You'll see.

31:04.879 --> 31:06.181
-Will.

31:18.359 --> 31:20.861
Aah!
-Oh! Oh.

31:23.497 --> 31:26.834
-You disappear in this country,
you're gone!

32:20.554 --> 32:22.623
Ah! Get up there!
Hup! Hup!

32:22.756 --> 32:24.159
Oi, get up there now!

32:24.292 --> 32:26.460
-Ah! Ah! Ah!

32:26.594 --> 32:27.428
-Get up there!

32:30.298 --> 32:31.432
-There it is!

32:32.399 --> 32:34.602
Just beyond that peak.

32:36.972 --> 32:38.306
-And push!

32:43.477 --> 32:44.578
-Push!

32:46.314 --> 32:47.414
That's it.

32:59.127 --> 33:01.196
The air's thin up here.

33:01.329 --> 33:02.730
You got to move easy, alright?

33:14.276 --> 33:15.343
Push!

33:22.350 --> 33:23.450
-Push.

34:20.308 --> 34:22.576
-You can only see a small part
of it from here.

34:24.478 --> 34:25.545
-I'll be damned.

34:26.647 --> 34:28.315
-And by some buffalo.

34:42.830 --> 34:43.831
-My God.

35:10.191 --> 35:12.060
Whoo!

35:17.865 --> 35:19.134
Aah!

35:27.708 --> 35:29.444
This is God, Charley!

35:29.576 --> 35:30.711
This is God!

35:33.714 --> 35:34.983
Easy does it, young fella.

35:36.451 --> 35:38.987
-Charley, this is
what I wanted to see.

35:40.621 --> 35:41.523
Whoo!

36:00.741 --> 36:03.945
- Well, that was a hell
of a trip.

36:04.079 --> 36:05.313
-Wasn't so bad.

36:11.119 --> 36:13.221
"Wasn't so bad."

36:13.354 --> 36:15.523
Son of a bitch.

36:15.656 --> 36:17.192
He said it wasn't so bad.

36:21.628 --> 36:24.731
How about you, Mr. Andrews?

36:24.865 --> 36:26.733
Did you get your money's worth?

36:26.867 --> 36:31.139
- Well, Fred, you know,
we're here, so, yeah.

36:31.272 --> 36:34.175
-Goddamn!

36:34.309 --> 36:37.479
You are about as much fun
as a one-legged whore.

36:39.613 --> 36:41.182
One-legged and one-armed.

36:44.519 --> 36:46.254
Shit, I gotta piss.

36:47.922 --> 36:51.059
It wasn't so bad.
-Dirty, filthy son of a whore.

36:51.192 --> 36:53.328
He's got the taint in him.

36:53.461 --> 36:55.029
-He's tough on the nerves,
Charley,

36:55.163 --> 36:57.031
but we'll have to tolerate him.

37:00.301 --> 37:03.071
-I do, um, I do have a question.

37:05.240 --> 37:06.341
Why?

37:09.010 --> 37:10.445
Hunting buffalo.

37:10.578 --> 37:14.415
I mean, it's clearly dangerous,
hard work, uh,

37:14.549 --> 37:18.052
there's no guarantee
of a payoff, and...

37:18.186 --> 37:21.889
there's many other ways
to make a living, so,

37:22.023 --> 37:23.057
why?

38:15.776 --> 38:19.681
There's a way
to killing buffalo.

38:19.813 --> 38:21.516
Through the lungs
is the best shot,

38:21.649 --> 38:23.750
if you're meeting them head-on.

38:25.253 --> 38:27.488
But if you're coming
from the side,

38:27.622 --> 38:30.024
aim just below the shoulder.

38:30.158 --> 38:31.259
Heart shot.

38:35.496 --> 38:36.331
-You got to get the

38:36.464 --> 38:38.132
leader of the herd, first.

38:39.400 --> 38:42.503
You can't tell
just from looking.

38:42.637 --> 38:45.106
Something you gotta

38:45.240 --> 38:46.307
feel.

39:12.200 --> 39:14.602
You can never know
what a buff is thinking.

39:16.137 --> 39:19.207
All a man can do is just plow
into them,

39:19.340 --> 39:20.208
kill them when he can,

39:20.341 --> 39:21.509
and not try

39:21.643 --> 39:22.809
to figure anything out.

39:23.844 --> 39:27.582
You think too much,
you get yourself into trouble.

39:59.681 --> 40:02.583
They can hear and smell us
at distance,

40:02.717 --> 40:04.719
so we stay downwind.

40:47.362 --> 40:48.563
Wind's just right.

40:50.031 --> 40:52.300
At distance,

40:52.433 --> 40:56.170
bit of wind will push
or pull it a foot or more.

41:40.314 --> 41:42.517
See the big one with the scars?

41:42.650 --> 41:44.118
Hide ain't worth a damn.

41:44.252 --> 41:45.153
That's the leader.

42:14.182 --> 42:15.283
-Wow.

42:16.951 --> 42:17.819
You missed.

42:17.952 --> 42:19.887
-I didn't miss.

42:20.021 --> 42:22.123
A heart shot buffalo will go
100 yards sometimes

42:22.256 --> 42:23.191
before it falls.

43:10.037 --> 43:12.640
We got the leader,

43:12.773 --> 43:15.576
so they won't run so far
the next time.

43:23.618 --> 43:26.187
That there's the one
they're following now.

43:29.624 --> 43:31.626
Through the lungs.
Watch.

43:53.748 --> 43:54.782
I got them.

43:54.917 --> 43:55.984
By God!

43:56.117 --> 43:58.052
I've got them buffaloed.

43:58.786 --> 44:00.321
Run back to the camp.
Gave me a fresh rifle

44:00.454 --> 44:01.689
and more cartridges.

44:01.822 --> 44:03.457
Bring back a bucket of water.
Get!

44:19.240 --> 44:20.708
-Those darn buffalo,

44:20.841 --> 44:23.110
they just stand there
and they let him shoot them.

44:23.244 --> 44:25.346
-Yeah, but I never seen it
so fast.

44:25.479 --> 44:27.448
-You better hope
they run pretty quick,

44:27.582 --> 44:29.317
else we'll be skinning
all night.

44:29.450 --> 44:31.987
-The Lord giveth
and the Lord taketh away.

44:32.119 --> 44:34.622
He taketh away and, if you're
lucky, He giveth back again.

45:05.820 --> 45:07.855
-How many we get?

45:07.990 --> 45:10.224
-Clean 'er out.
She's getting caked inside.

45:49.064 --> 45:51.066
-Damn it!

45:51.198 --> 45:52.733
A lick shy.

45:52.867 --> 45:54.036
Think about what a bump's
going to do,

45:54.168 --> 45:56.270
and you get yourself
into trouble.

45:56.404 --> 45:57.939
I could've had the whole herd!

45:59.240 --> 46:00.142
-Your head?

46:00.274 --> 46:01.275
-The whole herd!

46:01.409 --> 46:02.443
-Ah.

46:04.012 --> 46:05.780
It was a big stand, huh?

46:05.914 --> 46:07.648
-I never had bigger.

46:07.782 --> 46:10.052
You and Fred start skinning now.

46:10.184 --> 46:11.218
He's going to need your help.

46:16.058 --> 46:17.258
Aah!

46:21.595 --> 46:24.565
-This cutting edge,
that'll last you all day,

46:24.699 --> 46:26.600
almost,
without having to resharpen.

46:26.734 --> 46:29.137
You can see here
how thick that gets.

46:29.270 --> 46:30.871
Getting through that's
a bitch.

46:41.882 --> 46:43.985
Things start coming across.

46:44.119 --> 46:45.286
Don't happen quick.

46:57.465 --> 46:59.134
I always keep the balls.

47:00.102 --> 47:03.838
Those are good eatin'
and put starch in your pecker.

47:07.641 --> 47:09.177
-And we start coming
off of here.

47:45.981 --> 47:47.815
Give this to Charley.

47:47.949 --> 47:49.217
It'll keep us from getting sick.

48:43.337 --> 48:46.473
-O Lord!

48:46.607 --> 48:48.310
Do you deliver us from evil?

49:04.259 --> 49:05.359
Come get it.

49:07.229 --> 49:08.129
Come get it.

49:21.575 --> 49:22.509
-Miller, um,

49:22.643 --> 49:24.612
what was Charley doing earlier,

49:24.745 --> 49:25.613
with the powder?

49:25.746 --> 49:27.148
-It's wolf poison.

49:27.282 --> 49:28.816
That was strychnine
he was using.

49:28.950 --> 49:30.952
He does that, we won't have
any trouble with wolves.

49:32.053 --> 49:35.489
He thinks wolves are the devil
himself, Charley does.

49:35.623 --> 49:38.525
-And the -- the rock circle?

49:38.659 --> 49:39.928
-Oh.
-What was that?

49:40.061 --> 49:44.165
-These are all
Indian burial grounds.

49:51.239 --> 49:53.141
I chose a sacred place to camp.

50:03.919 --> 50:06.187
-So, we're not the first

50:06.321 --> 50:08.356
to hunt this herd,
after all, then.

50:08.489 --> 50:15.330
-Those Indians have been hunting
these here buffalo for ages.

50:16.664 --> 50:18.832
But times are changing.

50:18.967 --> 50:20.135
Ain't that right, Charley?

50:20.268 --> 50:21.403
-Amen.

50:21.535 --> 50:24.438
Oh, nothing,
no thing is permanent.

50:25.773 --> 50:29.510
The eyes of our Lord are upon us
from the very beginning of time

50:29.643 --> 50:31.146
to the end of days.

50:31.845 --> 50:32.948
Ain't that right?

50:35.951 --> 50:37.818
-Miller,

50:37.953 --> 50:39.154
how do you know Fred?

50:41.455 --> 50:44.725
-He's -- He's a --
He's a savage desperado.

50:44.858 --> 50:47.996
He's like a damn bandito,
isn't he?

50:49.530 --> 50:52.733
Don't trust him, far as I could
pick him up and throw him.

50:54.970 --> 50:56.737
-Why would you hire him, then?

50:56.870 --> 50:58.073
-It's hard to find a skinner

50:58.206 --> 50:59.506
who ain't had a brush
with the law.

51:00.342 --> 51:02.843
Makes a good hand,
works hard, works fast.

51:02.978 --> 51:05.447
Most don't run their mouths off
quite like him.

51:05.579 --> 51:07.115
- Boo!

51:07.248 --> 51:09.550
-Did you have to do that
so loud?!

51:09.683 --> 51:11.885
My ears are still ringing
from the rifle.

51:14.422 --> 51:16.757
-I was getting damn sick
of your cooking, Hoge.

51:22.063 --> 51:23.164
Oh!

51:26.234 --> 51:27.936
All a body needs now is
a woman.

51:28.836 --> 51:32.240
-It's carnal temptation of the
woman's flesh that'll getcha.

51:32.374 --> 51:35.477
- You saying you ain't never had
a woman, Charley?

51:35.609 --> 51:37.644
Huh?

51:37.778 --> 51:41.082
Well, I guess you still got one
good arm to pull your pecker.

51:48.023 --> 51:50.425
Ah, shit.

51:50.557 --> 51:53.061
You remember that little whore,
back in Butcher's?

51:55.763 --> 51:57.564
What was her name?

51:57.698 --> 51:59.000
-Francine.

51:59.134 --> 52:01.403
-Francine, that's right.

52:03.271 --> 52:04.805
That's a damn pretty whore.

52:04.939 --> 52:07.475
-Eh, Jezebel, shit-ass whore.

52:07.608 --> 52:09.911
Work of the devil
is what it is.

52:10.045 --> 52:13.281
-That's the first thing I'm
going to do when I get back --

52:13.415 --> 52:14.615
see old Francine.

52:16.617 --> 52:20.355
I reckon she's pretty
heated up for you, Will,

52:20.488 --> 52:22.123
way she was looking at you.

52:22.991 --> 52:24.259
-I didn't notice that.

52:24.392 --> 52:25.692
-No?

52:25.826 --> 52:27.062
You didn't notice?

52:29.663 --> 52:31.399
You sure as shit noticed.

52:32.766 --> 52:34.302
Well, how was she?

52:34.436 --> 52:36.104
Give us all the details.

52:36.237 --> 52:37.505
Was she your first?

52:43.144 --> 52:45.380
You ain't even had her.

52:45.513 --> 52:47.148
Look at him.

52:47.282 --> 52:48.983
That's the finest piece of tail
I ever saw.

52:49.117 --> 52:50.018
He ain't even had her.

52:50.151 --> 52:52.353
-That's enough, Fred.

52:52.487 --> 52:53.988
Out here, thinking
about what you can't have

52:54.122 --> 52:55.957
will drop you off your feed.

52:56.091 --> 52:57.459
-Ah, lighten up, Miller.

52:59.961 --> 53:02.796
What else are we going to talk
about out here, killing animals?

53:06.434 --> 53:10.838
Not when young Will here's
in love.

53:10.972 --> 53:12.040
Shit.

53:14.608 --> 53:16.978
Well,

53:17.112 --> 53:19.581
I can't wait to get back
to St. Louis myself.

53:22.517 --> 53:26.254
-Women, pocketful of money,

53:26.387 --> 53:29.257
some good eats.
-You like it too high, Fred.

53:29.390 --> 53:30.858
You like it too high.

53:32.659 --> 53:35.029
-Yeah, too high.

53:35.163 --> 53:36.630
I'll be damned, too high.

53:40.001 --> 53:41.236
-I know you.

53:51.913 --> 53:53.181
-This ain't no living, out here.

53:55.383 --> 53:58.086
Ripping hides off dead animals
in the middle of nowhere.

54:01.990 --> 54:03.057
Hell no.

54:17.005 --> 54:21.209
-Alright, just breathe easy
and don't overthink it.

54:38.792 --> 54:39.726
Good.

55:05.954 --> 55:07.055
-Miller.

55:08.889 --> 55:11.459
Miller, there's no sense
shooting more

55:11.593 --> 55:12.994
than we can skin.

55:14.395 --> 55:15.463
-Miller.

55:18.233 --> 55:21.169
Now, I told you before that I'm
not skinning stiff buff.

55:21.302 --> 55:22.403
I told you that.

55:24.738 --> 55:27.475
-I'll help with the skinning,
if need be, but help you or not,

55:27.609 --> 55:29.477
you will skin them, Fred.

55:29.611 --> 55:30.811
You'll skin them
if they're bloated.

55:30.945 --> 55:32.447
You'll skin them
if they're froze.

55:32.580 --> 55:34.015
You'll skin them if you have
to pry their hides off

55:34.148 --> 55:35.849
with a goddamn crowbar!

55:37.685 --> 55:41.289
Fred, when you crawl
away from here,

55:41.422 --> 55:42.924
you crawl away quietly.

55:44.125 --> 55:46.461
These buffalo spook,

55:46.594 --> 55:47.662
I'll shoot you.

55:51.165 --> 55:52.066
-Goddamn it.

56:00.008 --> 56:01.009
-Give me a fresh one.

56:19.494 --> 56:21.996
You know, the Indians used
to use this bone

56:22.130 --> 56:24.198
for just about everything.

56:24.332 --> 56:27.769
Everything from needles
to war clubs

56:27.901 --> 56:31.105
and make a knife
out of it so sharp,

56:31.239 --> 56:32.340
it'd split you right in two.

56:34.709 --> 56:38.980
Toys for the little ones
and combs for the women.

56:39.714 --> 56:43.685
I've seen necklaces carved
so pretty out of this stuff,

56:43.817 --> 56:45.720
you'd think it was made
in St. Louis.

56:48.855 --> 56:49.924
Goddamn waste.

56:53.860 --> 56:55.396
We don't belong out here.

57:35.902 --> 57:37.472
-God's always watching you.

57:37.605 --> 57:40.375
Wherever you go,
there He is, watching you.

58:25.787 --> 58:27.188
Here.

58:27.321 --> 58:28.356
This will clean you out.

58:28.489 --> 58:30.258
Drink it.

58:33.494 --> 58:34.395
Drink it!

59:21.709 --> 59:22.743
Miller!

59:39.360 --> 59:40.862
Miller!

01:00:24.805 --> 01:00:26.774
-Getting damn sick
of buffalo meat.

01:00:28.543 --> 01:00:29.577
Damn sick of it.

01:00:37.652 --> 01:00:38.987
Hey, goddamn it!

01:00:40.721 --> 01:00:42.690
You hear me?!

01:00:42.823 --> 01:00:44.659
I said I'm sick
of buffalo meat!

01:00:55.503 --> 01:00:56.939
We've been here three weeks.

01:00:59.407 --> 01:01:01.676
That's a week longer than
we were supposed to be here.

01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:08.182
Whaddya say we pack it
out of here tomorrow?

01:01:09.650 --> 01:01:11.085
Nights are getting cold.

01:01:12.587 --> 01:01:14.221
There ain't no telling
what the weather's going to do

01:01:14.355 --> 01:01:16.290
this time of year.
Isn't that right, Charley?

01:01:16.424 --> 01:01:17.825
-Leave Charley alone.

01:01:26.935 --> 01:01:28.202
-Miller, goddamn it.

01:01:30.605 --> 01:01:33.507
Even if we stay,

01:01:33.641 --> 01:01:35.710
how are we going to get
all them hides back?

01:01:42.550 --> 01:01:44.052
-We load what we can now,

01:01:44.185 --> 01:01:46.554
come back in the spring
and pack out the rest.

01:01:48.789 --> 01:01:50.157
-I know what that means.

01:01:52.193 --> 01:01:53.594
That means you want to stay here

01:01:53.728 --> 01:01:56.230
until you wiped out
the whole herd.

01:01:56.364 --> 01:01:57.365
-It's my party.

01:01:58.499 --> 01:02:00.768
-You can't kill
every goddamn buffalo

01:02:00.901 --> 01:02:03.105
in the whole goddamn country!

01:02:03.237 --> 01:02:04.405
-Eat some buffalo meat!

01:02:10.078 --> 01:02:11.980
-You're a goddamn lunatic!

01:02:15.549 --> 01:02:17.585
-Miller, I --

01:02:17.718 --> 01:02:18.619
Miller.

01:02:18.753 --> 01:02:19.955
He's right.

01:02:20.088 --> 01:02:21.555
We've been here long enough.

01:02:24.792 --> 01:02:27.062
How many more
are you going to get?

01:02:27.194 --> 01:02:30.197
-When we're done, we'll sure
have something to show for it.

01:02:30.331 --> 01:02:31.632
-We have something to show.

01:02:32.767 --> 01:02:33.634
We got enough.

01:02:46.714 --> 01:02:48.249
Miller.

01:02:48.382 --> 01:02:50.384
What are we still doing
out here?!

01:02:52.253 --> 01:02:54.755
-I'm out here to hunt buffalo,

01:02:54.889 --> 01:02:57.558
haul back their hides,
and sell them.

01:03:41.235 --> 01:03:44.472
Think you can step on my head?

01:03:46.607 --> 01:03:48.476
You can...

01:03:48.609 --> 01:03:52.948
...take your 2,000 pounds
and try to

01:03:53.081 --> 01:03:55.416
crush my skull in?

01:04:06.293 --> 01:04:09.131
Now, you're all going to die.

01:04:26.014 --> 01:04:27.848
I'm not fucking smiling.

01:04:49.837 --> 01:04:51.940
Trying to get out of the valley.
I need some help.

01:04:52.073 --> 01:04:53.507
-Well, there ain't
but 200 of them left.

01:04:53.641 --> 01:04:54.875
Why don't you let them go?

01:04:55.010 --> 01:04:56.077
-Get on your horse.

01:04:57.145 --> 01:04:58.679
Will, get on your horse.

01:05:04.819 --> 01:05:07.888
I'll head down valley 200 yards.

01:05:08.023 --> 01:05:12.459
All you have to do is stay here,
quiet, and don't spook 'em.

01:05:40.255 --> 01:05:41.856
-Do buffalo ever go crazy?

01:05:46.427 --> 01:05:47.461
-Yah!

01:05:47.595 --> 01:05:48.729
Hyah!

01:05:52.867 --> 01:05:53.935
-Miller!

01:05:54.069 --> 01:05:56.704
Do buffalo ever go crazy?!

01:05:59.941 --> 01:06:01.276
-Easy, easy, now.

01:06:24.165 --> 01:06:27.168
-Goddamn it, Will!

01:06:27.302 --> 01:06:28.502
Stop!

01:06:31.438 --> 01:06:32.506
Goddamn it, Will!

01:06:44.252 --> 01:06:46.187
-Go! Go!

01:06:46.321 --> 01:06:48.156
Get outta here!
Leave!

01:06:48.290 --> 01:06:49.190
Leave!

01:06:55.829 --> 01:06:57.098
Miller!

01:06:58.532 --> 01:06:59.633
Miller!

01:07:01.002 --> 01:07:02.103
Miller!

01:07:03.171 --> 01:07:04.672
-You damn fool!

01:07:04.805 --> 01:07:06.674
You scattered them!

01:07:06.807 --> 01:07:09.643
Is it worth your fucking life?!

01:07:09.777 --> 01:07:11.578
Aaah!

01:07:11.712 --> 01:07:13.681
Aaaaaaah!

01:07:13.814 --> 01:07:15.549
You goddamn fool!

01:07:15.683 --> 01:07:17.584
-What happened?
-Scared my bison!

01:07:17.718 --> 01:07:20.355
Now, we'll be here another week
longer or more.

01:07:50.385 --> 01:07:51.953
Damn, let's go.

01:07:52.087 --> 01:07:53.455
-You said it'd be alright.

01:07:53.587 --> 01:07:55.290
You said we'd get out
before the snow comes.

01:07:55.423 --> 01:07:57.192
-Let the animals
lead us back to camp.

01:07:57.325 --> 01:07:58.293
Come on.

01:07:58.426 --> 01:07:59.693
-I told you I didn't want
to come.

01:07:59.827 --> 01:08:00.894
I told you.

01:08:06.900 --> 01:08:08.569
-Hey!
We need cover!

01:08:08.702 --> 01:08:10.038
She's coming in fast!

01:08:12.107 --> 01:08:13.040
-Step up!

01:08:40.201 --> 01:08:41.469
Will!

01:08:41.602 --> 01:08:43.103
Help me drag this hide.

01:08:52.981 --> 01:08:56.017
Fred!
Get over here!

01:08:56.151 --> 01:08:57.285
-No!

01:08:57.419 --> 01:08:58.920
-Have you gone crazy, Fred?!

01:08:59.054 --> 01:09:01.287
-I'm taking care of myself!

01:09:01.423 --> 01:09:03.290
-You've never been through
one of these blizzards!

01:09:03.424 --> 01:09:04.857
-Oh, leave me alone, goddamn it!

01:09:04.992 --> 01:09:06.294
I know what to do.

01:09:06.428 --> 01:09:07.861
Will.

01:09:09.063 --> 01:09:10.964
-As quietly as you can.

01:09:11.098 --> 01:09:12.466
The more you move around,
the more likely you are

01:09:12.598 --> 01:09:13.666
to get froze.

01:10:10.491 --> 01:10:11.724
You alright, boy?

01:10:22.803 --> 01:10:23.870
-Yeah.

01:10:28.476 --> 01:10:30.677
-Jesus Christ!

01:10:30.811 --> 01:10:32.280
Can't see a fucking thing.

01:10:32.413 --> 01:10:33.514
Oh.

01:10:36.683 --> 01:10:37.750
Oh.

01:10:39.053 --> 01:10:40.021
Hit my fingers,

01:10:40.155 --> 01:10:42.822
and my feet are damn near froze.

01:10:44.159 --> 01:10:45.425
Oh!

01:10:45.559 --> 01:10:47.327
-I'll wake Charley and...

01:10:48.495 --> 01:10:50.231
...we'll head back to camp.

01:10:51.933 --> 01:10:53.367
Get a fire going.

01:10:55.503 --> 01:10:57.804
I'll take a look at that pass.

01:11:31.438 --> 01:11:32.339
Unh!

01:11:44.986 --> 01:11:46.087
-Well, how'd it look?

01:11:48.754 --> 01:11:51.593
Huh? How'd it look?
-Ah!

01:11:51.758 --> 01:11:52.793
Drink.

01:11:58.299 --> 01:12:00.434
We're snowed in good.

01:12:00.567 --> 01:12:03.404
I couldn't get within
a half mile of that pass.

01:12:06.273 --> 01:12:08.343
-I told you sons of bitches
we had to get out of here.

01:12:08.476 --> 01:12:09.776
You didn't listen to me,
and now,

01:12:09.911 --> 01:12:11.777
look what you've gotten us into.
Goddamn it!

01:12:14.748 --> 01:12:17.352
-How long will we have
to be here?

01:12:18.818 --> 01:12:20.455
-We're here
until that pass thaws,

01:12:20.588 --> 01:12:21.990
which won't be until spring.

01:12:25.826 --> 01:12:26.860
-What?

01:12:28.663 --> 01:12:29.563
Spring?

01:12:29.696 --> 01:12:30.632
-Six months, at the least;

01:12:30.763 --> 01:12:32.967
eight months, at the most, so.

01:12:33.101 --> 01:12:35.503
Might as well dig in good
and get ourselves set

01:12:35.637 --> 01:12:37.472
for a long wait.
-Unh-unh.

01:12:37.605 --> 01:12:39.540
Not this feller here, huh-unh.

01:12:39.674 --> 01:12:41.675
No, this feller here's going
to get himself out.

01:12:41.808 --> 01:12:45.480
-If you can find a way, Fred,
you go to it.

01:12:47.147 --> 01:12:49.017
-Is the pass the only way out?

01:12:49.150 --> 01:12:51.152
-Unless you want to walk up
over them mountains.

01:12:51.286 --> 01:12:53.920
-What's wrong with that?!
-You can't live off the land

01:12:54.054 --> 01:12:55.490
in the high country
in the winter.

01:12:55.623 --> 01:12:57.692
-We should at least try it!

01:12:57.824 --> 01:12:59.093
We have to try it!

01:12:59.227 --> 01:13:00.995
-You ever try
to wait out a storm

01:13:01.129 --> 01:13:02.862
on the side of a mountain?

01:13:02.996 --> 01:13:04.699
You wouldn't last an hour.

01:13:04.830 --> 01:13:06.067
Especially you.

01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:07.901
-Well, it's a chance.
I'll take it!

01:13:08.036 --> 01:13:11.339
-There ain't nothing between
here and Denver, Fred!

01:13:11.472 --> 01:13:12.873
And Denver's a long way off!

01:13:13.007 --> 01:13:14.909
-Well, pick me out
some landmarks, goddamn it!

01:13:15.043 --> 01:13:16.544
I'll -- I'll find it on my own!

01:13:16.678 --> 01:13:18.913
-We need to get a fort set up
before nightfall.

01:13:25.253 --> 01:13:26.353
-Fuck it.

01:13:26.487 --> 01:13:27.588
I'll sit here on my

01:13:27.722 --> 01:13:28.955
fat ass

01:13:29.089 --> 01:13:30.758
and I'll collect my $60 a month.

01:13:32.192 --> 01:13:33.227
And I want my money.

01:13:41.169 --> 01:13:43.571
You better get that belt out
and give me that money.

01:13:58.452 --> 01:14:01.621
-I trusted you.

01:14:01.755 --> 01:14:03.825
-It'll be alright, Charley.

01:14:03.958 --> 01:14:05.960
-"It'll be alright, Charley."

01:14:14.867 --> 01:14:16.571
I'm cold, is all.

01:14:16.704 --> 01:14:18.106
It's just that I'm cold.

01:14:18.239 --> 01:14:19.639
Any-Anybody, anybody.

01:14:22.143 --> 01:14:23.311
I fell asleep a little

01:14:23.443 --> 01:14:26.347
and they throw my ass out
in the cold?

01:14:26.481 --> 01:14:27.615
They can burn in hell.

01:15:25.106 --> 01:15:26.307
-No buffalo.

01:15:26.441 --> 01:15:27.375
-We ain't got much meat left,

01:15:27.508 --> 01:15:28.809
and the flour's ruined.

01:15:28.942 --> 01:15:30.577
We got one more sack of beans.

01:15:30.710 --> 01:15:32.045
-We ain't too high to find game.

01:15:32.179 --> 01:15:34.382
I'll go out tomorrow
and get us something.

01:15:35.482 --> 01:15:37.151
Ow!
-You see the stock?

01:15:37.285 --> 01:15:39.320
-Oh, yeah.

01:15:39.454 --> 01:15:42.490
They made it through, with luck.

01:15:42.623 --> 01:15:44.759
-With luck.
-Fred, I swear, you ain't got

01:15:44.892 --> 01:15:47.061
a cheerful bone in your body.

01:15:47.195 --> 01:15:48.995
You got no call to complain.

01:15:49.129 --> 01:15:51.665
-I got call,
and you know I got call.

01:16:01.541 --> 01:16:03.210
How's about a little story?

01:16:05.646 --> 01:16:08.715
It says here,
in the beginning there was

01:16:08.849 --> 01:16:10.884
the heavens and the earth.

01:16:11.018 --> 01:16:13.454
And it also says the heavens...
-That's my Book!

01:16:13.588 --> 01:16:14.688
-...she was formless.

01:16:14.821 --> 01:16:16.691
-That ain't yours!
That's mine!

01:16:16.824 --> 01:16:18.425
Give it back,
you little cocksucker!

01:16:18.558 --> 01:16:20.094
-Now, Charley,
is this the kind of God

01:16:20.228 --> 01:16:21.629
that you believe in, huh,

01:16:21.762 --> 01:16:23.563
one that does bullshit
like this?

01:16:23.697 --> 01:16:26.867
-You get your greasy,
thieving hands off --

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:27.902
-That's enough!

01:16:28.035 --> 01:16:28.902
-Here's your Book right there.

01:16:29.036 --> 01:16:30.338
-No! Oh!

01:16:38.379 --> 01:16:40.447
Oh, shit.

01:16:40.580 --> 01:16:43.584
-I'll get you another Book
when we get back, Charley.

01:16:43.718 --> 01:16:45.553
-Blasphemer!

01:16:45.686 --> 01:16:48.089
Bleeding blasphemer!

01:16:48.222 --> 01:16:49.557
-I can't hear what you're
saying, Charley,

01:16:49.690 --> 01:16:50.491
but it doesn't sound good.

01:16:50.625 --> 01:16:52.759
-Can't you ever shut up?!

01:16:56.597 --> 01:16:57.831
-God!

01:17:39.307 --> 01:17:41.308
-You got any more
in that pot, Hoge?

01:17:42.843 --> 01:17:45.478
Yeah.
-There you go.

01:17:56.089 --> 01:17:59.125
Oh, thank you, Charley.

01:20:26.907 --> 01:20:28.808
-Okay, Fred?

01:20:28.943 --> 01:20:30.844
-Something ain't right.

01:20:30.978 --> 01:20:33.379
I got the stomach of a buff.

01:20:41.422 --> 01:20:42.991
Hey!

01:20:43.125 --> 01:20:44.192
Hey!

01:20:46.962 --> 01:20:48.495
You want to die out here?

01:20:48.629 --> 01:20:50.165
Is that what you want, huh?

01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:55.103
Look at me.

01:20:57.370 --> 01:20:58.472
Miller's gone crazy.

01:20:58.606 --> 01:21:00.307
He's crazy.

01:21:00.441 --> 01:21:03.643
He ain't even here.

01:21:03.777 --> 01:21:05.579
And I ain't gonna die
for no fucking buffalo.

01:21:05.713 --> 01:21:07.380
You hear me?
I ain't gonna do it.

01:21:11.786 --> 01:21:13.654
We can get outta here.

01:21:13.788 --> 01:21:14.789
You and --

01:21:17.025 --> 01:21:17.925
You and me,

01:21:18.058 --> 01:21:19.326
we can slip out at night.

01:21:29.737 --> 01:21:32.072
-Will, help me dress this down.

01:21:45.019 --> 01:21:46.221
-You goddamn coward.

01:22:36.237 --> 01:22:38.638
We can get through.

01:22:38.772 --> 01:22:42.776
I went clean through
the other side of the pack.

01:22:44.411 --> 01:22:46.580
40, 50 yards of hard pack,

01:22:46.714 --> 01:22:49.317
then clean as a whistle
after that.

01:22:49.450 --> 01:22:50.986
We can get through it easy.

01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:00.262
Well?

01:23:01.329 --> 01:23:02.629
Want to get loaded up?

01:23:02.763 --> 01:23:05.066
-We aren't taking a chance
on a cave-in!

01:23:05.799 --> 01:23:07.268
Get those horses buried

01:23:07.401 --> 01:23:10.170
under a couple of tons
of wet snow and then what?

01:23:14.674 --> 01:23:16.076
Aren't you even going
to go look?!

01:23:17.913 --> 01:23:19.446
-Still got a few days.

01:23:20.181 --> 01:23:21.282
We'll wait.

01:23:32.027 --> 01:23:33.128
-We're going to wait.

01:23:35.263 --> 01:23:37.431
All we've been doing is waiting!

01:23:39.799 --> 01:23:40.668
Goddamn it.

01:23:53.214 --> 01:23:54.316
Fuck you looking at?

01:23:54.447 --> 01:23:55.349
Hmm?

01:23:55.482 --> 01:23:56.549
-Hmph.

01:24:05.858 --> 01:24:08.029
-Will, come with me.

01:24:10.630 --> 01:24:11.598
Let's get more wood.

01:24:43.431 --> 01:24:46.067
-What I couldn't figure out --

01:24:46.201 --> 01:24:48.236
if we were all eating
the same thing...

01:24:50.904 --> 01:24:53.540
...why was I the only one
getting sick?

01:24:53.674 --> 01:24:57.077
-I-I-I-I don't know what --
what you're talking about.

01:24:57.212 --> 01:24:58.846
Th-That's for the wolves.

01:24:59.679 --> 01:25:04.018
-What's that say in your Book,
Charley, about killing?

01:25:04.919 --> 01:25:06.553
If you going to kill a man,
you ought to give him

01:25:06.687 --> 01:25:08.123
a lethal dose, Charley.

01:25:09.456 --> 01:25:13.594
'Cause dying by degrees,
that makes a man suspicious.

01:25:15.629 --> 01:25:18.098
Now, suspicion, that ain't
a sin, is it, Charley?

01:25:21.567 --> 01:25:22.568
Oh, God!

01:25:22.702 --> 01:25:24.071
Ooh.

01:25:24.205 --> 01:25:25.005
Ohh.

01:25:25.139 --> 01:25:26.340
Help me...

01:25:26.473 --> 01:25:27.474
Oh!

01:25:31.245 --> 01:25:33.281
Oh!

01:25:33.415 --> 01:25:35.416
Help me.

01:25:35.549 --> 01:25:37.518
Oh!
Ah-ah-ooh!

01:26:20.195 --> 01:26:21.661
-Going somewhere, Fred?

01:26:31.004 --> 01:26:32.272
-Ooh.

01:26:35.608 --> 01:26:38.045
-He tried to kill me
with wolf poison.

01:26:38.179 --> 01:26:39.347
Goddamn snake.

01:26:43.717 --> 01:26:45.885
I always knew you were
a coward, Fred.

01:26:49.623 --> 01:26:51.625
-He tried to goddamn kill me.

01:26:55.396 --> 01:26:57.065
I gotta get outta here, Miller.

01:27:00.067 --> 01:27:01.701
I can't stand this anymore.

01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:10.710
-If I didn't need your help
getting off this mountain...

01:28:52.146 --> 01:28:54.382
How long you think we'll be
getting back to Butcher's?

01:28:54.514 --> 01:28:56.284
-Less than a fortnight.
We'll get back quicker

01:28:56.416 --> 01:28:57.817
than we came.

01:28:57.951 --> 01:29:00.554
-I don't think I'll hardly stop.

01:29:00.687 --> 01:29:02.022
Just get some greens on my belly

01:29:02.156 --> 01:29:06.995
and slosh it with some whiskey.

01:29:07.128 --> 01:29:08.329
See that girl some.

01:29:10.797 --> 01:29:12.066
Then I'll be off to St. Louis.

01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:13.634
You'll never see me again.

01:29:50.338 --> 01:29:51.371
-Hey!

01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:54.342
We're too top-heavy, goddamn it!

01:29:59.313 --> 01:30:00.682
We're top-heavy as hell,
I'm telling you.

01:30:00.813 --> 01:30:02.183
We're not going to make it down.

01:30:02.317 --> 01:30:05.219
-If we take it careful,
the axles will hold.

01:30:05.353 --> 01:30:06.587
Hold on.

01:30:11.159 --> 01:30:12.059
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:30:14.195 --> 01:30:15.463
-Easy, now, easy.

01:30:15.596 --> 01:30:16.731
Easy.

01:30:31.878 --> 01:30:34.415
-We're carrying 1,500 hides.

01:30:34.549 --> 01:30:36.784
Better than 3,000 back
at the camp.

01:30:36.918 --> 01:30:38.486
So, 4,700 in all.

01:30:38.619 --> 01:30:42.557
My God, that's better
than $18,000!

01:30:42.690 --> 01:30:45.125
I don't ever recall
a hunt being that big.

01:30:49.297 --> 01:30:51.465
I'm going to ride
into Butcher's Crossing

01:30:51.598 --> 01:30:53.500
with a real load.

01:30:53.634 --> 01:30:56.003
Watch their eyes pop
out of their heads.

01:31:09.717 --> 01:31:10.751
Hey, Fred!

01:31:10.884 --> 01:31:11.952
You thought I was crazy?

01:31:12.085 --> 01:31:13.620
You thought I was
fooling around?

01:31:15.056 --> 01:31:16.624
You're going to be a rich man!

01:31:18.892 --> 01:31:20.862
I asked for $60 a month,
I been getting it.

01:31:21.027 --> 01:31:23.364
Fred Schneider takes care
of hisself.

01:31:23.498 --> 01:31:25.500
Don't ask nobody for nothing.

01:31:28.568 --> 01:31:30.871
Easy, now, easy.

01:31:31.004 --> 01:31:32.473
-Step up.

01:31:32.607 --> 01:31:33.674
Step up.

01:31:35.809 --> 01:31:37.644
- Easy.

01:31:41.816 --> 01:31:43.183
Miller, goddamn it.

01:31:43.317 --> 01:31:44.218
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:31:45.486 --> 01:31:47.155
Miller!

01:31:48.955 --> 01:31:50.191
Miller!

01:31:53.494 --> 01:31:54.495
Aah!

01:31:54.629 --> 01:31:55.963
Aaaah!

01:33:36.196 --> 01:33:37.531
-Where is everybody?

01:33:40.601 --> 01:33:41.469
McDonald.

01:34:18.306 --> 01:34:19.205
-Where's McDonald?

01:34:26.147 --> 01:34:28.115
McDonald!

01:34:28.249 --> 01:34:29.650
-Who's that?!

01:34:29.784 --> 01:34:31.285
-What are you doing in here?

01:34:41.094 --> 01:34:42.797
-My God!

01:34:42.931 --> 01:34:44.699
I'd given you up for dead.

01:34:48.302 --> 01:34:50.304
You found your buffalo?

01:34:50.437 --> 01:34:53.808
-Biggest kill that ever come
through this territory.

01:34:54.775 --> 01:34:56.376
Just like I said it would be.

01:35:15.329 --> 01:35:17.831
Ain't you looked around you?

01:35:17.965 --> 01:35:20.134
The bottom's dropped
out of the whole market.

01:35:20.867 --> 01:35:24.672
The hide business is finished,
for good.

01:35:24.804 --> 01:35:25.906
You're finished!

01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:28.275
You --
-We had an agreement.

01:35:28.409 --> 01:35:32.847
$4 apiece for prime hides,
and I aim to hold you to it.

01:35:32.981 --> 01:35:35.049
-I wish you could,
but you can't hold me to nothing

01:35:35.182 --> 01:35:36.616
because I got nothing.

01:35:36.750 --> 01:35:38.419
If you'd have gotten back
when you were supposed to,

01:35:38.552 --> 01:35:40.054
you would've got your money!

01:35:40.187 --> 01:35:42.455
Those hides down at the pits
I bought and paid for

01:35:42.589 --> 01:35:44.026
when you was in the mountains,

01:35:44.157 --> 01:35:46.527
I got 30,000, 40,000,

01:35:46.661 --> 01:35:48.396
worth 10 cents apiece!

01:35:48.529 --> 01:35:49.429
You want them?!

01:35:49.562 --> 01:35:51.732
-Just last year, prime hides...

01:35:51.866 --> 01:35:55.268
-That was last year!
-...$4 apiece.

01:35:55.402 --> 01:35:56.603
You remember beaver?

01:35:56.737 --> 01:35:57.871
When they stopped wearing
beaver hats,

01:35:58.005 --> 01:35:59.974
you couldn't give
the skins away.

01:36:00.107 --> 01:36:03.911
Looks like everybody who owns
a buffalo rope has one

01:36:04.045 --> 01:36:06.213
and nobody wants any more!
-I got

01:36:06.347 --> 01:36:09.084
3,000 hides,

01:36:09.215 --> 01:36:11.119
winter prime,

01:36:11.251 --> 01:36:13.654
cached up in the mountains!

01:36:13.788 --> 01:36:15.321
-You don't listen to me,
do you?!

01:36:28.070 --> 01:36:29.137
-Miller.

01:36:57.732 --> 01:36:58.799
-Will.

01:37:01.402 --> 01:37:02.803
You had your hunt.

01:37:03.838 --> 01:37:04.940
-Yes, sir.

01:37:06.674 --> 01:37:07.942
Yes, sir.

01:37:10.144 --> 01:37:12.812
-You lost your tail,
just like I told you you would.

01:37:23.790 --> 01:37:24.791
Tell me, boy...

01:37:26.995 --> 01:37:28.362
...was it worth it?

01:37:36.504 --> 01:37:40.508
-I saw what I needed to see,
sir.

01:37:44.179 --> 01:37:46.580
Young folk.

01:37:46.714 --> 01:37:49.217
Always think there's something
to find out.

01:37:50.550 --> 01:37:53.654
Not enough to get a job
and work.

01:37:53.788 --> 01:37:55.489
Have to find something bigger.

01:38:58.619 --> 01:39:00.054
-For now, you're

01:39:00.187 --> 01:39:01.455
young and soft.

01:39:16.570 --> 01:39:17.804
- Aaaah!

01:39:27.048 --> 01:39:29.650
- He's gone crazy!

01:39:35.455 --> 01:39:37.092
What is he doing?!

01:39:38.159 --> 01:39:39.326
-Someone get the buckets.

01:39:43.231 --> 01:39:45.000
-Worked so hard for this.

01:39:46.901 --> 01:39:49.137
I can't believe he's
burning it all down.

01:39:50.638 --> 01:39:53.840
-He's burning all the hides!
-Goddamn drunk!

01:39:58.980 --> 01:40:00.748
-We got to put this thing out!

01:40:31.445 --> 01:40:34.481
-Why doesn't someone
do something?!

01:40:41.888 --> 01:40:43.391
My God!

01:40:43.523 --> 01:40:44.525
My God!

01:40:52.665 --> 01:40:53.599
- Oh!
