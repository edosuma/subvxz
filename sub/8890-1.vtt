Grandma passed out five songs ago, and
she has, like, zero boom-boom-pow.

- Can we pleeease play now?
- Sorry, I've gotta go.

25:32.412 --> 25:36.716
Just be careful, okay? And don't
tell anyone about... you know.

25:36.750 --> 25:40.019
Uh, yeah, sure.
I'm cool.

And... nobody believes
anything Benny says anyways.

I'm serious, okay?
And whatever you do,

do not invite a vampire
into your house.

she's winning.

the car, so that works for me.

to show up.

into you, huh?

Oh, yeah. We had
a real heart-to-heart.

35:11.308 --> 35:12.575

to Erica. Alone.

So, now you have time for me?

No, no, it's cool.
Be my guest.

I'll go find Jesse.
He'll, uh,

really want to know
you're here.

35:26.555 --> 35:29.658
Come on! You're not safe here.
We have to get out of here now!

You sound like my mother.
Don't worry, party pooper!

35:34.097 --> 35:36.799
It's not like I'm going
to give in to peer pressure.

even drinking.

for Rory, remember?

No, we're supposed to be
waiting in the car.

36:03.326 --> 36:05.827
But if I'm going to die,
I'm going to die rich,

36:05.862 --> 36:08.497
with some "Vampires Gone Wild"
footage.

36:08.531 --> 36:11.133
You're going to get us caught!

right?

- Playing the game. Play along.

36:33.856 --> 36:36.391

I got bit by a vampire,

a fledgling!

You really expect me
to believe that?

I swear.
And if we don't get out now,

37:05.354 --> 37:07.289
we'll never get out,
like, ever!

they're after
the "Cuban animals."

Cuban animals?
You mean <i>cubile animus?</i>

47:35.403 --> 47:37.371

it before. I think

No. They started
when you showed up.

I'll consider it a snack.

49:15.436 --> 49:19.506

what the prophecy is?

01:13:51.037 --> 01:13:53.038
to wherever his followers are
buried, okay?

01:13:53.073 --> 01:13:55.441
Um... where is that?

01:13:55.475 --> 01:13:59.578
Yep. Found love
at the snack bar, my friend.

01:13:59.613 --> 01:14:02.581
- Ha! Ow...
- Benny.

01:14:02.616 --> 01:14:07.319
Okay, the prophecy
says, "The dead take root,

01:14:07.354 --> 01:14:09.722
a barren orchard bears
the devil's fruit."

01:14:09.756 --> 01:14:12.124
Okay. A barren orchard, uh...
Benny?

01:14:12.159 --> 01:14:16.762
You know, I gave her my address:
Fifty-three Orchard Park.

01:14:16.797 --> 01:14:19.131
Come any time.

01:14:19.166 --> 01:14:23.702
Wait... That tree.
That tree from my visions!

01:14:23.737 --> 01:14:25.471
I know that tree.

01:14:29.576 --> 01:14:32.077
Okay, it's not possible...

01:14:37.383 --> 01:14:38.717
- Benny?
- Hm.

01:14:38.752 --> 01:14:41.754
- Benny, I'm going to call your grandma
to come get you, okay? - Okay.

01:14:41.788 --> 01:14:45.357
Okay, we've got four minutes
left to save the world.

01:14:45.392 --> 01:14:47.026
You hang tough, okay?

01:14:53.834 --> 01:14:56.635
I never did like that tree.

01:14:56.670 --> 01:15:00.539
[Jesse]: Funny how they name streets
after what they tore down to build them.

01:15:00.574 --> 01:15:04.777
This used to be an orchard;
One of my favorite spots

01:15:04.811 --> 01:15:08.581
until your idiot ancestors
burned my flock alive.

01:15:08.615 --> 01:15:10.549
Yeah? Well, I'd say

01:15:10.584 --> 01:15:13.052
their only mistake was not
finishing the job.

01:15:14.955 --> 01:15:16.889
You made me miss my target,

01:15:16.923 --> 01:15:19.558
so the rest of my flock may
have to wait a little longer.

01:15:19.593 --> 01:15:22.862
That's fine. I still have enough
Dusker souls here

01:15:22.896 --> 01:15:25.331
to resurrect a few dozen
of the most powerful

01:15:25.365 --> 01:15:27.132
vampires that ever lived.

01:15:27.167 --> 01:15:31.070
And you'll have the honor of being
their first midnight snack.

01:15:40.247 --> 01:15:42.081
Well,
you won't have to wait,

01:15:42.115 --> 01:15:46.852
because I'm going to reunite you
with your flock right now.

01:15:46.887 --> 01:15:49.588
Just not in this world.
Ha! Ha!

01:15:52.959 --> 01:15:55.895
[Struggling]

01:15:55.929 --> 01:16:00.699
It's funny, I knew your
grandfather's grandfather.

01:16:00.734 --> 01:16:02.868
He was a loser too.

01:16:02.903 --> 01:16:05.604
[Struggling]

01:16:05.639 --> 01:16:07.439
[Laughing softly]

01:16:07.474 --> 01:16:09.408
[Benny]: Courage!!

01:16:09.442 --> 01:16:11.577
Owww!

01:16:11.611 --> 01:16:13.212
Sorry, bud.

01:16:19.419 --> 01:16:21.620
The hour of rebirth has come.

01:16:21.655 --> 01:16:24.623
Brothers, sisters, arise!

01:16:26.393 --> 01:16:29.094
[Sarah yelling]
Whoa!

01:16:29.129 --> 01:16:30.597
[Both grunting with effort]

01:16:31.881 --> 01:16:34.317
Hey!
I've got your friends in a box.

01:16:34.351 --> 01:16:35.785
And I've got your babysitter.

01:16:35.820 --> 01:16:38.021
Okay, she's really
Jane's babysitter.

01:16:38.055 --> 01:16:39.455
Give me the <i>cubile animus!</i>

01:16:39.490 --> 01:16:42.425
- The souls must be transferred now!
- Sarah!

01:16:42.459 --> 01:16:43.993
Just give it to him.

01:16:44.028 --> 01:16:47.497
What are we going to do with
a nest of souls anyway? EBay it?

01:16:47.531 --> 01:16:50.066
Now! Hand it over,
or she dies!

01:16:50.100 --> 01:16:51.467
Ethan, no, don't!

01:16:52.502 --> 01:16:56.502
[Benny's grandma and Jane]:
<i>Alma, alphras, selrnok, kathran</i>

01:16:58.502 --> 01:16:59.502
Aaah!

01:17:01.502 --> 01:17:05.102
Hey! You can have the box.
But not what's inside.

01:17:05.603 --> 01:17:08.102
You wrecked their premiere
Now you deal with them.

01:17:09.503 --> 01:17:12.102
No... No... No!

01:17:12.103 --> 01:17:14.102
No. what have you done?

01:17:15.103 --> 01:17:16.102
Aaah!

01:17:20.103 --> 01:17:22.102
[screams in pain]

01:17:32.103 --> 01:17:34.102
Can't believe you
dated that guy.

01:17:38.753 --> 01:17:40.402
Oh hey!
You're back.

01:17:41.253 --> 01:17:42.402
Had fun?

01:17:42.403 --> 01:17:44.402
Yeah. it was—
it was... fun.

01:17:44.403 --> 01:17:47.402
- Except that th— the...
- You know what they say about karma?

01:17:48.403 --> 01:17:49.992
How was your night?
Did you have any trouble?

01:17:50.703 --> 01:17:53.992
Ah, not much.
It was... pretty dead.

01:17:56.003 --> 01:17:58.992
No no no. I'd like to ask you
not to repeat these silly rumors

01:17:58.993 --> 01:18:01.492
of alledged "attacks" in here.

01:18:02.093 --> 01:18:06.492
In the first place, fans of the vampire
genre have active imaginations.

01:18:06.993 --> 01:18:08.192
And secondly,

01:18:08.593 --> 01:18:12.892
I am told that defective
3D glasses may have cause

01:18:12.893 --> 01:18:15.092
adverse neurological side effects.

01:18:16.093 --> 01:18:19.492
In any case, there won't be anymore
<i>Dusker</i> events of my watch. Believe it.

01:18:20.493 --> 01:18:24.892
Faulty 3D glasses? Who's gullible
enough to believe that.

01:18:25.003 --> 01:18:28.092
Ahm... These are <i>Duskers</i>
we're talking about, remember?

01:18:28.593 --> 01:18:30.992
Oh Besides. Town is safe.

01:18:31.593 --> 01:18:33.092
Jesse's rejoined his flock.

01:18:35.093 --> 01:18:36.092
It's all good, right?

01:18:36.693 --> 01:18:38.092
Yeap.

01:18:38.693 --> 01:18:41.092
You— You're not
still dying, are you?

01:18:41.493 --> 01:18:44.592
I mean... you mortal body
seems to be doing just fine.

01:18:45.193 --> 01:18:48.692
Thanks, well... Benny's grandmother
makes a mean human blood substitute.

01:18:48.693 --> 01:18:50.792
That, and she found my spell book.

01:18:50.793 --> 01:18:51.792
Hey guys!

01:18:55.593 --> 01:18:57.092
[Muffled voice]
Hey.

01:19:00.093 --> 01:19:02.092
Pretty much all over.

01:19:04.593 --> 01:19:06.092
- Let's go to class.
- Good idea.

01:19:08.093 --> 01:19:10.092
The trick with the spell is...

01:19:10.093 --> 01:19:13.392
you gotta phrase it like Klingon,
kinda like with a Romulan twang.

01:19:13.393 --> 01:19:14.592
It's like a splash of Cylon...

01:19:14.593 --> 01:19:17.092
[Ethan] Benny!
[Ethan and Sarah] Shut up!

01:19:17.093 --> 01:19:18.092
[Benny] Sorry.
