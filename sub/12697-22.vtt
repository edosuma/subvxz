Spencer, would you get that?

{\an8}It's open.

00:08.173 --> 00:11.678
{\an8}[silly grunting]

{\an8}Fencing with my robot.

00:18.651 --> 00:20.019
{\an8}-You beating him?
-Not yet.

00:21.221 --> 00:22.455
{\an8}But he's scared.

00:24.391 --> 00:26.659
{\an8}Wanna see me take him down?

00:26.726 --> 00:28.695
{\an8}Nah, I'm gonna go swallow
some of your food.

00:35.435 --> 00:37.003
{\an8}-Ha!
-Ah!

00:39.906 --> 00:41.040
Hey, Freddie wants us
upstairs

00:41.107 --> 00:42.809
so he can check the lighting
before the show.

00:42.876 --> 00:45.044
Before I can even think
about "iCarly,"

00:45.111 --> 00:47.080
What is this slop?

00:47.147 --> 00:48.782
That slop is veggie pudding.

00:48.848 --> 00:50.049
My cousins
are coming this weekend,

00:50.116 --> 00:52.318
So I have to make stuff
they can eat.

00:52.385 --> 00:53.753
The Dorfmans are coming here?

00:53.820 --> 00:55.321
-This weekend?
-Yes.

00:55.388 --> 00:56.856
I've told you three times.

00:56.923 --> 00:58.124
Awww.

00:59.692 --> 01:00.894
What? You hate your cousins?

01:00.960 --> 01:03.096
I didn't say I hate them,
but, yes.

01:04.263 --> 01:05.765
Well, what's wrong with them?

01:05.832 --> 01:07.567
Besides their last name
being Dorfman?

01:08.868 --> 01:10.870
And they're just all dorky
and goofy and weird

01:10.937 --> 01:12.739
and have allergies
and sing songs.

01:12.806 --> 01:14.007
And they stop by here
every year

01:14.073 --> 01:16.042
when they take
their dumb family road trip

01:16.109 --> 01:18.611
to the Fresno raisin parade.

01:18.678 --> 01:19.913
How come I never met them?

01:19.979 --> 01:21.214
'Cause I like you.

01:21.281 --> 01:22.582
-Let's go!
-Coming.

03:10.790 --> 03:12.058

-See you.

03:15.161 --> 03:16.596

Okay, people,
let's go celebrate.

Whoa, you are not going out.

Why not?

a week left

and you haven't
even started yet.

03:26.639 --> 03:29.342
Sam? Read a book?

03:29.409 --> 03:30.543
I can read a book.

03:30.610 --> 03:33.246
Name three books you've read.

03:33.313 --> 03:35.048
"Boogie Bear," "Boogie Bear II"
and "Boogie Bear III,

03:35.114 --> 03:36.783
the Return of Boogie Bear."

03:37.984 --> 03:40.553
Oh, my God, Sam,
you never read a real book?

03:40.620 --> 03:42.422
I've been busy.

03:42.488 --> 03:44.390
She couldn't read a book
If she tried.

03:44.457 --> 03:45.525
Says you.

-Oh.

03:49.629 --> 03:52.031
I'll bet you I can read
"The Penny Treasure"

03:52.098 --> 03:53.132
by the end of the week.

03:53.199 --> 03:54.434
-Don't bet.
-It's a bet.

03:54.500 --> 03:56.102
And they bet.

03:56.703 --> 03:58.805
And shall we bet the yoozh?

03:58.871 --> 04:00.540
-Don't bet the yoozh.
-The yoozh it is.

04:00.607 --> 04:02.241
They bet the yoozh.

04:09.549 --> 04:11.517
If we go, you promise
you'll start reading

-You coming or what?
-No.

04:35.041 --> 04:36.476
-Good.
-Later.

Man, I cannot keep hanging out
with girls all the time.

You wanna come hang with me
at the fencing studio?

Is it fun?
Like, what goes on?

-It's pretty cool.

You think it'd be okay
with your mom?

-No.
-Let's do it.

05:21.554 --> 05:23.990
Okay, now, the goal
is to land a touch,

What's it to you, Toder?

06:08.968 --> 06:10.703
-Who's he?
-Toder.

06:12.638 --> 06:15.942
Just a rotten teenager
who thinks he's all bad,

06:16.008 --> 06:17.643
cause he's good at fencing.

06:17.710 --> 06:19.212
How many times have you
and me fenced?

06:19.278 --> 06:21.247
Oh, I don't know, like 30?

06:21.314 --> 06:24.250
And how many times
have you lost?

06:24.317 --> 06:26.152
I don't know, like 30.

beat my man Freddie here

my boy Chop and Cleeshay.

Yeah, he couldn't even beat us.

06:37.964 --> 06:39.932

Talk's cheap, Toder.

06:42.001 --> 06:43.536

This is food for my cousins.

07:59.779 --> 08:01.814
Ah, the Dorfmans.

08:01.881 --> 08:03.816
You know how hard it is
making dinner for six,

08:03.883 --> 08:06.452

sugar, sodium, fat or gluten?

08:06.519 --> 08:08.521
-How hard?
-Quite.

08:08.588 --> 08:10.022
And don't take this
the wrong way,

20 times in a row.

Twenty-two,
but who is counting--I am!

09:04.577 --> 09:06.379
Alright, kid.
Don't get cocky yet.

09:06.445 --> 09:09.048
You're good,
but you're not Doug Toder good.

09:09.115 --> 09:12.151
Aww, can Toder do this?

Yes.

-Did you try calling him?
-No, Sam.

I'm just keeping my cell phone
warm here

09:48.587 --> 09:50.356
between my cheek
and my shoulder.

09:52.291 --> 09:53.559
He's not answering.

09:53.626 --> 09:55.061
Well, maybe
something important came up.

If he was doing
something important,

10:02.201 --> 10:03.135
then
why didn't he just call me?

Stay here
and have dinner with us.

10:12.211 --> 10:13.212
You said they're
a bunch of dorks--

10:13.279 --> 10:14.814
-Sam.
-Okay.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.048
Yay.

10:16.115 --> 10:18.417
I'm not eating
any of that jank food you made.

10:19.785 --> 10:21.821
Hello, Carly.

10:21.887 --> 10:24.023
Hi.
Hello.

10:24.090 --> 10:25.591
This is my friend Sam.

10:25.658 --> 10:28.694
Sam, this is my uncle Barry,
my aunt Tess, and my cousins,

10:28.761 --> 10:30.129
Ozlottis and Faye.

10:30.196 --> 10:32.565
Uh, what's that thing
around his neck?

10:33.933 --> 10:36.669
Oh, Ozlottis has a scab
on his chin.

10:36.736 --> 10:38.804
The cone keeps him
from picking at it.

10:39.805 --> 10:41.340
I'm out.

10:42.908 --> 10:44.443
Be right back.

10:46.178 --> 10:47.546
You said
you'd have dinner with us.

10:47.613 --> 10:48.414
Yes.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.616
And then I met them.

10:50.683 --> 10:52.418
Come on,
Spencer's not back yet,

10:52.485 --> 10:53.919
and I don't think I can make it
through an evening alone

10:53.986 --> 10:54.954
with the Dorfmans.

10:55.021 --> 10:56.322
Oh, how bad can it be?

10:56.389 --> 10:58.691
♪ Row, row, row your boat ♪

10:58.758 --> 11:00.860
♪ Gently down the stream ♪

11:00.926 --> 11:02.695
♪ Merrily, merrily
Merrily, merrily ♪

11:02.762 --> 11:05.131
♪ Life is but a dream
merrily down the stream ♪

11:05.197 --> 11:07.700
♪ Row, row, row your boat ♪

11:16.208 --> 11:17.543
Duck.

11:17.610 --> 11:19.178
Duck.

11:20.379 --> 11:22.448
Duck. Duck.

11:22.515 --> 11:23.649
Goose--

11:23.716 --> 11:25.451
Carly, now you have to chase
Faye.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.086
Okay.

11:28.454 --> 11:29.922
Come here, Faye.

11:31.357 --> 11:32.491
Hi.

11:32.558 --> 11:33.626
Sorry, I am late.

11:33.692 --> 11:35.094
-Hello, Spencer.
-Me too.

11:35.161 --> 11:36.262
-Spencer.
-Hi.

11:36.328 --> 11:37.596
We missed you at dinner.

11:37.663 --> 11:39.899
Listen, I feel really bad
about being late,

11:39.965 --> 11:41.700
but I was helping
Carly's friend, Freddie,

11:41.767 --> 11:43.702
with his fencing.

11:43.769 --> 11:46.038
-But I'm here now.
-Yeah, not good enough.

11:46.739 --> 11:49.475
Whoa! Dorfman gotta hit
the road.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.710
Yes,
we have a long drive to Fresno.

11:51.777 --> 11:53.012
Right, for the raisin parade.

11:53.079 --> 11:55.481
We haven't missed
the raisin parade in 12 years.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.316
Ozlottis has a scab
on his chin.

11:58.484 --> 12:00.553
Okay. Come on, family.

12:00.619 --> 12:02.121
Bye, Spencer.
Bye.

12:02.188 --> 12:03.656
Carly. Bye.

12:03.722 --> 12:05.124
We will see you next.

12:05.191 --> 12:06.592
[overlapping chatter]

12:06.659 --> 12:08.494
It's nature's fruit.

12:09.095 --> 12:10.563
-You're mad at me.
-Yep.

12:10.629 --> 12:11.730
Look, I'm sorry.

12:11.797 --> 12:13.999
But the time just got away
from me.

12:14.066 --> 12:15.968
Well, I wish the time
had gotten away from me,

12:16.035 --> 12:17.036
but no.

12:17.103 --> 12:18.370
I got to spend
the last two hours

12:18.437 --> 12:20.706
on planet Dorfman.

12:20.773 --> 12:22.241
You have every right to be mad.

12:22.308 --> 12:23.943
Clearly.

12:24.009 --> 12:25.778
See, Freddie's got to fence
this really mean kid

12:25.845 --> 12:26.946
named Doug Toder.

12:27.012 --> 12:28.147
I don't wanna hear
about Doug Toder.

12:28.214 --> 12:28.948
-But--
-Eh--

12:29.014 --> 12:30.583
-Carly--
-I said, "Eh."

12:31.951 --> 12:33.519
Your fencing
with Freddie days are over.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.721
-But--
-No more fencing with Freddie.

12:36.689 --> 12:38.023
Okay.

12:38.090 --> 12:39.358
And since I made you
suffer through--

12:39.425 --> 12:40.726
I did suffer.

12:42.194 --> 12:43.195
I'll help you clean up
the kitchen.

12:43.262 --> 12:44.296
No.

12:44.363 --> 12:45.664
You'll go in there
and you'll clean up

12:45.731 --> 12:47.366
the kitchen yourself.

12:48.334 --> 12:49.735
Okay.

12:59.145 --> 13:00.880
Hm.

13:03.549 --> 13:06.185
[gagging]

13:21.400 --> 13:23.002
Sam, you can come back
downstairs now.

13:23.068 --> 13:25.371
-The Dorfmans left so--
-Shh.

13:28.807 --> 13:31.010
You're actually reading
your book.

13:31.076 --> 13:32.178
Sure am.

13:32.244 --> 13:33.445
I am impressed.

13:33.512 --> 13:35.281
Who's the dude?

13:35.347 --> 13:36.515
David.

13:36.582 --> 13:39.018
I hired him
read the book to me.

13:39.084 --> 13:40.553
Then why is he rubbing
your feet.

13:40.619 --> 13:41.987
'Cause he was late.

13:42.054 --> 13:43.489
So I started reading
the book myself

13:43.556 --> 13:44.957
and it is fantastic.

13:45.024 --> 13:48.594
These things are great.
It's like TV in your head.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.129
Well, I'm happy you
like reading.

13:50.196 --> 13:52.264
But I still didn't get
why David's rubbing your feet.

13:52.331 --> 13:55.334
I already paid the kid.
I had to make him do something.

13:55.401 --> 13:57.169
Please call my mother.

13:58.771 --> 14:00.239
Harder.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.445
Well, I guess this is it,
Senor saber.

14:08.013 --> 14:10.249
I will never thrust you again.

14:10.316 --> 14:12.785
[knocking at door]
It's open.

14:13.852 --> 14:16.155
-What's up, Spence?
-Nothing.

14:16.222 --> 14:17.356
Come on.

14:17.423 --> 14:19.725
I just had a nap,
drank two cans of peppy cola,

14:19.792 --> 14:21.126
and now I am ready for action.

14:24.263 --> 14:25.197
I can't.

14:25.264 --> 14:26.398
Why not?

14:26.465 --> 14:27.700
Carly got mad at me

14:27.766 --> 14:29.268
for missing dinner
with the Dorfmans.

14:29.335 --> 14:31.070
Now I' not allowed to fence
anymore.

14:31.136 --> 14:32.771
So you're just gonna
let your little sister

14:32.838 --> 14:34.506
tell you what to do?

14:34.573 --> 14:36.275
Oh, come on. Don't go getting--

14:41.680 --> 14:42.648
What was that?

14:42.715 --> 14:44.383
I sliced your banana.

14:45.451 --> 14:48.387
What are you gonna do
about it, huh?

14:49.922 --> 14:51.991
I'll show you
what I'm gonna do.

14:53.826 --> 14:55.427
En garde!

14:55.494 --> 14:59.064
[excited grunting]

15:03.435 --> 15:04.370
Give me it.

15:04.436 --> 15:05.804
Oh!

15:06.939 --> 15:08.907
You promised me
no more fencing.

15:08.974 --> 15:10.476
He sliced my banana.

15:11.810 --> 15:13.912
Anyway, you can't stop us
from fencing.

15:13.979 --> 15:15.514
Oh, can't I.

15:17.983 --> 15:19.518
-Where is she going?
-I don't know.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.724
Either of you guys
got any lotion?

15:25.791 --> 15:27.393
-Sorry, buddy.
-Nope.

15:30.896 --> 15:32.364
-Who's that?
-No idea.

15:34.566 --> 15:36.035
He what?

15:36.101 --> 15:37.970
-My mom.
-Oh, my God.

15:39.938 --> 15:41.240
How dare you teach Freddie

15:41.307 --> 15:43.309
something as dangerous
as fencing?

15:43.375 --> 15:45.511
Mom, you don't know
anything about fencing.

15:45.577 --> 15:46.779
It's not dangerous.

15:46.845 --> 15:48.280
I know more about fencing
than you think.

15:48.347 --> 15:49.615
You're coming home with me
right now

15:49.682 --> 15:50.616
and having a tick bath.

15:50.683 --> 15:51.950
I don't have ticks.

15:52.017 --> 15:54.353
'Cause the tick baths
are working, aren't they?

15:54.420 --> 15:57.289
-Ha-ha. Tick bath.
-I should give you one.

16:05.364 --> 16:06.231
Hey, Sam.

16:06.298 --> 16:07.833
We found a tub
of old mayonnaise

16:07.900 --> 16:09.268
in the dumpster
by the cafeteria.

16:09.335 --> 16:10.369
We're gonna fill
these balloons with it

16:10.436 --> 16:11.570
and throw it
at Ms. Briggs' car.

16:11.637 --> 16:12.838
Come on.

16:12.905 --> 16:14.707
Shh.

16:14.773 --> 16:16.342
Reading.

16:20.879 --> 16:22.915
Make sure
you get her windshield.

16:24.583 --> 16:25.718
-Hi.
-Hey.

16:25.784 --> 16:26.919
Freddie.

16:26.985 --> 16:28.854
I'm sorry about the tick bath.

16:28.921 --> 16:30.389
I was just really mad
at Spencer so I--

16:30.456 --> 16:31.757
I am not upset
about the tick bath.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.359
I get those every other week.

16:34.560 --> 16:36.261
It's just--

16:37.062 --> 16:39.732
Well, I do "iCarly" with you
and Sam all the time,

16:39.798 --> 16:41.100
and I love it.

16:41.166 --> 16:43.001
But it was just kinda cool

16:43.068 --> 16:44.636
hanging' out with a guy,
you know?

16:44.703 --> 16:46.372
Now you hate me.

16:46.438 --> 16:47.973
Carly, come on.

16:48.040 --> 16:49.274
You're like my best friend.

16:49.341 --> 16:51.076
Your best friend that you hate.

16:52.044 --> 16:54.213
I am not bad I promise.

16:54.279 --> 16:56.248
Maybe we'll go get
a smoothie later, okay?

16:56.315 --> 16:57.850
Okay.

16:58.817 --> 16:59.985
Hey, Sam.

17:00.052 --> 17:01.954
Does your mom drive you
on pickup truck?

17:02.020 --> 17:03.756
-Yeah.
-It's on fire.

17:03.822 --> 17:05.958
Shh. Reading.

17:11.130 --> 17:12.564
Absolutely not.

17:12.631 --> 17:14.299
But if I hadn't told you,
you never would've even known.

17:14.366 --> 17:16.135
I will not allow Freddie
to fence.

17:16.201 --> 17:17.403
But it's not dangerous.

17:17.469 --> 17:18.737
-Ha.
-Come on.

17:18.804 --> 17:20.472
Freddie needs some guy time.

17:20.539 --> 17:22.107
And he and Spencer get along
very great,

17:22.174 --> 17:24.376
so I think you should let him--
[knocking at door]

17:29.448 --> 17:31.917
-What's going' on?
-Nothing.

17:31.984 --> 17:33.519
Go home
and check yourself for ticks.

17:35.287 --> 17:37.523
I'm trying to talk your mom
into letting you fence.

17:37.589 --> 17:38.657
-No.
-Why not?

17:38.724 --> 17:39.758
I'm really good at it.

17:39.825 --> 17:41.193
Don't you ever say that again?

17:41.260 --> 17:42.995
-We're going home right now.
-No.

17:43.061 --> 17:44.596
Fredward Benson.

17:45.898 --> 17:46.965
Give me one good reason

17:47.032 --> 17:48.467
why I shouldn't be allowed
to fence.

17:50.869 --> 17:53.172
The Fencin' Bensons.

17:56.108 --> 17:57.810
The Fencin' Bensons?

17:57.876 --> 18:00.045
Sit down, Freddie.

18:03.048 --> 18:04.950
I never wanted you to know.

18:05.017 --> 18:06.418
What?

18:06.485 --> 18:09.655
Your great grandfather,
long before you were born,

18:09.721 --> 18:12.558
He led a troop
called the Fencin' Bensons.

18:12.624 --> 18:13.759
They performed

18:13.826 --> 18:15.427
with the Tingling
Brothers Circus.

18:16.728 --> 18:19.598
It was him, his brother,
and their seven cousins,

18:19.665 --> 18:23.502
They were gifted fencers,
wildly popular.

18:23.569 --> 18:25.737
The Tingling Brothers?

18:25.804 --> 18:27.239
Yes.

18:27.306 --> 18:31.043
Your great grandfather
was a master at fencing.

18:31.109 --> 18:33.946
But he became obsessed with it.

18:34.012 --> 18:35.881
He forced my father to fence.

18:35.948 --> 18:39.251
And later, my father made me.

18:39.318 --> 18:41.687
Fencing's in our blood,
Freddie.

18:41.753 --> 18:44.990
And I never wanted you
to become obsessed

18:45.057 --> 18:46.992
[whispering]
like our ancestors.

18:49.428 --> 18:51.697
Ah, come on.

18:51.763 --> 18:53.599
-It's true.
-Right.

18:53.665 --> 18:55.934
You know, my great grandfather
was a magical penguin.

18:56.001 --> 18:58.136
His name was Pingo.

18:58.203 --> 19:01.406
Mom, not letting me fence
is bad enough.

19:01.473 --> 19:04.243
I can't believe you'd make up
such an insane lie.

19:04.309 --> 19:05.410
I will not stand here

19:05.477 --> 19:08.180
and be called a liar
by my own son,

19:08.247 --> 19:10.115
or you, sassy pants.

19:11.717 --> 19:14.186
Mom, you let me fence

19:14.253 --> 19:16.421
against Doug Toder tonight
or else--

19:16.488 --> 19:17.656
Or else what.

19:17.723 --> 19:20.626
I'll never make another puzzle
with you again.

19:21.660 --> 19:23.195
Freddie.

19:23.262 --> 19:24.496
I mean it, Mom.

19:36.475 --> 19:39.177
What's in that first aid kit,
an ambulance?

19:39.945 --> 19:43.115
Just everything I need
in case Freddie gets hurt.

19:43.181 --> 19:45.617
-He will be fine.
-You better hope so, Missy.

19:46.718 --> 19:48.186
Well.

19:48.253 --> 19:49.221
[whistle blows]

19:49.288 --> 19:51.223
-You boys ready?
-Yes, sir.

19:51.290 --> 19:53.091
You're going down, Fredward.

19:55.427 --> 19:56.495
Ready.

19:56.562 --> 19:59.364
[applause]

19:59.431 --> 20:01.033
Fence.

20:04.136 --> 20:06.238
Point, Benson.

20:06.305 --> 20:08.740
[cheers and applause]

20:08.807 --> 20:10.175
Alright, Fredo.

20:10.242 --> 20:12.578
-Brilliant, Freddie.
-Kick his butt, Freddie.

20:14.079 --> 20:15.113
-I can't believe it.
-Yeah?

20:15.180 --> 20:17.115
Well, believe it punk.

20:20.018 --> 20:21.253
Ready.

20:23.689 --> 20:25.390
-Fence.
-[grunts]

20:27.159 --> 20:29.995
Point Benson!

20:30.062 --> 20:32.364
-Whoo!
-Insanity.

20:32.431 --> 20:34.099
Way to poke his chest, Freddie.

20:34.166 --> 20:35.500
Poke it again!

20:37.135 --> 20:38.770
One more point Benson wins.

20:38.837 --> 20:40.005
What are you doing, Toder?

20:40.072 --> 20:41.773
You're losing' it, man.

20:41.840 --> 20:43.408
I know what I'm doing.

20:43.475 --> 20:44.676
Ready.

20:45.744 --> 20:46.678
Fence.

20:53.685 --> 20:54.620
What? Foul.

20:54.686 --> 20:55.954
Come on.

20:56.021 --> 20:57.856
[booing]

20:57.923 --> 20:59.491
Out of my way.

20:59.558 --> 21:01.727
You want a piece of me, Toder?

21:04.196 --> 21:05.864
[screams]

21:06.865 --> 21:08.700
Ah! Hey, help me.

21:10.669 --> 21:11.570
Somebody get her.

21:11.637 --> 21:13.639
Yeah? Good luck.

21:14.906 --> 21:16.308
Mom.

21:17.509 --> 21:19.277
[growls]

21:28.053 --> 21:30.122
Mom.

21:30.188 --> 21:32.157
Who's the best now, Toder?

21:34.259 --> 21:36.928
[cheers and applause]

21:36.995 --> 21:38.130
Go get him, Mom.

21:38.196 --> 21:39.364
Alright.

21:43.669 --> 21:45.370
-So that's him?
-Yeah.

21:45.437 --> 21:46.905
That's my great granddad.

21:46.972 --> 21:49.641
I always had a feeling
you came from circus people.

21:51.276 --> 21:53.178
Come on.
Let's go rehearse for "iCarly."

21:53.245 --> 21:54.479
Let's do it.
Wait, wait.

21:54.546 --> 21:56.682
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Not so fast there, circus boy.

21:56.748 --> 21:58.016
Pay up.

21:58.083 --> 22:00.419
-Pay what up?
-I won the bet.

22:00.485 --> 22:03.088
I read "The Penny Treasure"
cover to cover.

22:03.155 --> 22:04.523
Yay. Good for Sam.
Let's go rehearse.

22:04.589 --> 22:06.725
Wait.

22:06.792 --> 22:07.726
I don't believe you.

22:07.793 --> 22:09.361
-Quiz me.
-Okay.

22:09.428 --> 22:11.430
Who goes into the cave
and what does he find?

22:11.496 --> 22:12.731
Jarvis goes into the cave

22:12.798 --> 22:14.399
and finds the key
to tranquility,

22:14.466 --> 22:16.134
four feet from Gideon's grave.

22:16.201 --> 22:18.203
-Pay up.
-[groans]

22:18.937 --> 22:20.972
You bet the yoozh.

22:21.039 --> 22:22.774
Let's do it, boy.

22:29.648 --> 22:30.916
Give me.

23:03.381 --> 23:04.649
I'll get the mop.

23:11.790 --> 23:13.125
Okay, do you think you've seen
everything new

23:13.191 --> 23:14.292
there is to see at "iCarly"?

23:14.359 --> 23:15.527
-Is that what you think?
-Well.

23:15.594 --> 23:17.496
[imitates buzzer]

23:17.562 --> 23:18.797
-You haven't. Nope.
-You ain't.

23:18.864 --> 23:20.465
-You can see new videos.
-New picks.

23:20.532 --> 23:21.433
-New blogs.
-New games.

23:21.500 --> 23:22.634
-New lunch meats.

23:22.701 --> 23:24.436
There are no lunch meats
at iCarly.com.

23:24.503 --> 23:25.637
-Can we fix that?
-Shh.

23:25.704 --> 23:27.806
The point is you can see
tons of new stuff.

23:27.873 --> 23:29.641
Stuff you've never seen before.

23:29.708 --> 23:32.511
-All at iCarly.com.
-iCarly.com.

23:32.577 --> 23:34.045
You think we've said
iCarly.com enough?

23:34.112 --> 23:35.213
Yeah. Wait, no.
