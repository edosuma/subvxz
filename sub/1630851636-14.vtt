He killed my aunt.

05:21.190 --> 05:22.757
And you knew him?

He was Aunt Natalie's boyfriend.

He was a real jerk.

always threatening her

05:40.514 --> 05:42.864
that she better not leave him.

05:42.907 --> 05:44.866
And did you tell the police
about him?

05:44.909 --> 05:46.911
Yeah. And they said

05:46.955 --> 05:48.391
that they checked out his alibi,

05:48.435 --> 05:51.220
that he was in Philadelphia
with his cousin.

05:51.263 --> 05:55.398

that Curt was two blocks away

before he killed my aunt.

Research indicates that

08:48.832 --> 08:50.138
witnesses who testify remotely

08:50.181 --> 08:51.139
are seen as less credible.

08:51.182 --> 08:52.749
I know it's not ideal,

08:52.793 --> 08:54.229
but we don't have to prove
that Heglund's guilty

08:54.272 --> 08:55.839

only that it's

08:55.883 --> 08:58.494
more likely than not
that he killed Natalie.

Well, that's assuming that

as soon as the jury hears

Sam was nearly catatonic

09:21.430 --> 09:23.040
when the police arrived
that night.

09:23.084 --> 09:25.216
He wasn't able to make
a statement for weeks.

09:25.260 --> 09:28.393
And by that time,
Heglund's alibi was locked in.

09:28.437 --> 09:29.917
According to
the police file,

09:36.401 --> 09:39.187
Well, did they ever
charge this guy?Not with murder.

09:39.230 --> 09:41.102
He was awaiting trial
on the burglary

09:41.145 --> 09:42.712
when he died of a sudden
aneurism in jail,

09:42.756 --> 09:45.410
so they just closed
Natalie's case.

09:45.454 --> 09:46.629
Having an alt suspect
that the police liked

09:46.673 --> 09:47.935
is hard to overcome.

09:47.978 --> 09:50.590
I agree.
We might lose in court.

09:50.633 --> 09:52.461
But Sam has been

09:52.504 --> 09:53.767
punishing himself for years

09:53.810 --> 09:56.247
because he wasn't able
to save Natalie.

09:56.291 --> 09:58.772
It drove him to be a shut-in.

09:58.815 --> 10:00.556
So if we can break him out
of that prison,

10:00.600 --> 10:02.340
it's a win in my book.

10:09.913 --> 10:11.915

10:14.483 --> 10:16.616
And we have a client
who is an agoraphobe,

10:16.659 --> 10:18.966

make it to court.

11:06.970 --> 11:08.276
Well, okay, lunch.

11:08.319 --> 11:09.973
[sighs]

11:10.017 --> 11:11.453
Let me think about it.

11:12.976 --> 11:15.022
Okay?

11:15.065 --> 11:16.806
Ah, I'm late.

11:16.850 --> 11:21.245
Um, yeah, I'll just clean up.

11:21.289 --> 11:23.073
I don't have a key.

11:23.117 --> 11:25.249
It locks itself.[door shuts]

11:25.293 --> 11:28.470
CHUNK:
I hope you brought your strong
voir dire game today,

11:28.513 --> 11:29.906
'cause our evidence...

11:29.950 --> 11:32.169
When have I not brought
a strong voir dire game?

11:32.213 --> 11:34.215
I'm just saying. Sam?

11:36.043 --> 11:39.916
I get it. Sam is a...
tough sell.

11:41.613 --> 11:42.963
Even if...

11:43.006 --> 11:46.880
whenI get him to court,

11:46.923 --> 11:51.362
he is probably gonna
seem odd to the jury.

11:51.406 --> 11:52.755
But that's why we need jurors

11:52.799 --> 11:54.104
that will be inclined
to believe him.

11:54.148 --> 11:55.366
And those are?

11:55.410 --> 11:56.716
People who can understand

11:56.759 --> 11:58.195
that just because Sam has

11:58.239 --> 11:59.849
a crippling phobia
doesn't mean that

11:59.893 --> 12:01.546
he's an unreliable witness.

12:01.590 --> 12:03.026
[chuckles]

12:03.070 --> 12:05.855
Oh, I've got a good
idea for this one.

12:05.899 --> 12:08.640
Yeah. [laughs]
It's a good one.

12:08.684 --> 12:10.817
Should I be worried?No. No, no.

12:10.860 --> 12:13.297
We just have to make
a quick stop. Hey...

12:14.298 --> 12:15.604
I would like to talk
to you all

12:15.647 --> 12:16.997
a little bit about phobias,

12:17.040 --> 12:19.782
and how they do
and don't affect us.

12:19.826 --> 12:24.613
And one of the most
common phobias is... spiders.

12:27.616 --> 12:29.357
You, sir,

12:29.400 --> 12:30.750
do you suffer from
arachnophobia?

12:30.793 --> 12:34.014
Ever since I was a kid.
It's the legs.

12:34.057 --> 12:35.929
I was wondering if
you would be willing

12:35.972 --> 12:37.017
to do a little
experiment with me.

12:37.060 --> 12:38.670
Okay.

12:38.714 --> 12:41.369
Take a deep breath
and, uh, close your eyes.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.722
Now, how do you feel
knowing that this spider

12:46.766 --> 12:49.116
is near you right now?

12:49.159 --> 12:51.335
Kind of shaky.
Hmm.

12:51.379 --> 12:54.817
Like my... stomach is
on tumble-dry.

12:54.861 --> 12:56.776
And in spite of that feeling,

12:56.819 --> 12:59.604
do you know where
you are right now?

12:59.648 --> 13:02.825
Of course. I'm...
I'm in a courtroom.

13:02.869 --> 13:04.740
And do you know
who's talking to you?

13:04.784 --> 13:06.829
Yeah. The lawyer
with the spider.

13:06.873 --> 13:09.092
Okay, you can open
your eyes now, sir.

13:09.136 --> 13:12.356
Your Honor,
the plaintiffs find

13:12.400 --> 13:14.794
juror 47 acceptable.

13:18.319 --> 13:20.625
I want to talk
about this morning.

13:20.669 --> 13:22.802
Yeah, I'm sorry
I rushed out.

13:22.845 --> 13:24.847
Look, there's so much
going on with this case.

13:24.891 --> 13:27.197
You didn't rush out
because of the case.

13:27.241 --> 13:28.546
Look, I know
we've only been

13:28.590 --> 13:29.852
seeing each other
since Christmas,

13:29.896 --> 13:32.289
but I like you,

13:32.333 --> 13:34.291
and I thought
you liked me, too.

13:34.335 --> 13:37.251
But if I'm... if I'm
coming on too strong,

13:37.294 --> 13:39.688
or-- or getting too serious,
you know, you can tell me.

13:39.731 --> 13:42.343
I like serious.Well, then, why don't you
want me to meet your mom?

13:42.386 --> 13:44.301
[scoffs]

13:44.345 --> 13:47.348
It's not that I...
I don't want to...

13:47.391 --> 13:49.829
Look, it's her and it's me,
and it's a...

13:49.872 --> 13:51.134
Wait, she knows
you're gay, right?

13:51.178 --> 13:52.875
Yeah.

13:55.922 --> 13:58.925
We just don't discuss
my relationships.

13:58.968 --> 14:00.665
What does that mean?Just that.

14:00.709 --> 14:03.059
So it's don't ask,
don't tell.Rob...

14:03.103 --> 14:05.932
Chester, I get that
it's complicated.

14:05.975 --> 14:08.891
Believe me, I do.
But I have...

14:08.935 --> 14:10.588
I have been someone's
secret before, and I really,

14:10.632 --> 14:12.503
really don't want
to do it again.

14:12.547 --> 14:13.983
Okay, I want to be...

14:14.027 --> 14:15.332
I want to be part
of your whole life,

14:15.376 --> 14:17.073
not just the part
behind closed doors.

14:17.117 --> 14:18.640
That's not what I'm saying.

14:19.641 --> 14:21.338
Okay, look,

14:21.382 --> 14:22.862
why don't you have a nice
weekend with your mom,

14:22.905 --> 14:25.255
and-and we'll talk later, okay?

14:28.171 --> 14:29.520
Rob.

14:32.567 --> 14:34.482
[scoffs]

14:37.615 --> 14:39.879
Almost done.

14:39.922 --> 14:41.924
You'll be able to see
the witnesses when they testify

14:41.968 --> 14:43.186
and keep track of the case,

14:43.230 --> 14:45.710
until you're ready to go
in person.

14:45.754 --> 14:47.887
Thank you for, uh,

14:47.930 --> 14:50.106
for-for doing all this.

14:50.150 --> 14:52.892
I mean, I-I-I know
it must seem weird.

14:52.935 --> 14:54.284
Not at all.

14:54.328 --> 14:55.590
Gets me out of the office.

14:55.633 --> 14:58.680
[chuckles]
That's cool.

14:58.723 --> 15:01.552
Those all the places
you want to go one day?

15:01.596 --> 15:04.207
Oh, uh, I've been
to them all already.

15:05.513 --> 15:07.645
In virtual reality.

15:10.170 --> 15:11.911
Man, that sounds
nerdy, doesn't it?

15:11.954 --> 15:14.130
Uh, raise your hand
if you've ever had

15:14.174 --> 15:17.612
a noise complaint filed after
VR skydiving with your son.

15:19.222 --> 15:21.485
A lot of VR these days
is really good.

15:21.529 --> 15:23.748
I'm surprised...

15:23.792 --> 15:26.055
What?

15:26.099 --> 15:29.841
Oh, it's just I'm surprised
the VR doesn't trigger

15:29.885 --> 15:32.105
your... agoraphobia.

15:32.148 --> 15:33.584
Because it's so real.Oh...

15:33.628 --> 15:36.065
Ignore me. I don't know
what I'm talking about.

15:36.109 --> 15:38.241
Oh, no, no, no,
it's okay. Um...

15:38.285 --> 15:40.417
Most people think
that agoraphobia is

15:40.461 --> 15:42.115
fear of being outside.

15:42.158 --> 15:44.465
It's not?Uh, no.

15:44.508 --> 15:47.076
When I was 15 years old, uh,

15:47.120 --> 15:50.950
not long after my,
uh, my aunt died,

15:50.993 --> 15:53.082
I was still in regular school.

15:53.126 --> 15:55.345
And one day, two kids
got into a fight,

15:55.389 --> 15:58.305
and the shouting just
triggered a panic attack.

15:58.348 --> 16:02.657
I just froze in the hallway,

16:02.700 --> 16:06.966
and I mean,
I started shaking,

16:07.009 --> 16:09.881
crying...

16:09.925 --> 16:12.536
And-and kids stared and

16:12.580 --> 16:15.713
recorded on their
phones, and...

16:15.757 --> 16:17.889
I could not go back

16:17.933 --> 16:19.587
after that.

16:21.197 --> 16:24.244
And that is...
that's my agoraphobia.

16:24.287 --> 16:27.987
You know, the fear
of that panic.

16:28.030 --> 16:32.992
You know, that... humiliation.

16:33.035 --> 16:36.299
You know, I wanted to avoid
anything that might trigger it.

16:36.343 --> 16:39.694
And avoiding so much that...

16:39.737 --> 16:43.219
well, here I am.

16:43.263 --> 16:45.091
I'm sorry.No, I mean,

16:45.134 --> 16:46.875
it's-it's fine.

16:48.181 --> 16:49.704
[computer chimes]

16:49.747 --> 16:53.055
[indistinct chatter]Court's about to start.

16:53.099 --> 16:54.578
BAILILFF:
Court is now in session.

16:55.623 --> 16:58.539
The first witness is
Curt Heglund.

16:58.582 --> 17:00.236
HEGLUND: I swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth,

17:00.280 --> 17:03.022
and nothing but the truth,
so help me God.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.421
That's you at a liquor store,

17:11.465 --> 17:13.162
two blocks from
Natalie Richards' home,

17:13.206 --> 17:16.470
28 minutes before
she was murdered. Correct?

17:16.513 --> 17:18.080
Yes.

17:18.124 --> 17:20.517
But you told the police that
you were in Philadelphia

17:20.561 --> 17:24.130
with your cousin at the time
that Natalie was murdered.

17:24.173 --> 17:25.435
Yes.

17:25.479 --> 17:28.612
So you lied
about your alibi?

17:28.656 --> 17:30.962
Is that correct?

17:31.006 --> 17:32.529
I was out on parole.

17:32.573 --> 17:34.923
I didn't want any trouble
from the police.

17:34.966 --> 17:36.881
CHUNK: You didn't answer
the question, sir.

17:36.925 --> 17:39.971
Did you lie about your alibi?

17:41.799 --> 17:43.453
Yes.

17:43.497 --> 17:45.107
Mr. Palmer's really good.

17:45.151 --> 17:46.630
CHUNK: ...didn't want
any trouble with the police.

17:46.674 --> 17:48.632
You were worried that
they would discover that

17:48.676 --> 17:50.112
Natalie had broken up
with you?

17:50.156 --> 17:52.027
People break up all the time.
So what?

17:52.071 --> 17:54.160
Isn't it true that
you threatened her?

17:54.203 --> 17:58.120
Told her that she better
never, ever leave you, or else?

17:58.164 --> 18:00.122
HEGLUND:
I-I never said that,

18:00.166 --> 18:02.168
and anybody who says I did
is a liar.

18:02.211 --> 18:04.953
Like someone who would lie
to the police about their alibi?

18:07.564 --> 18:10.001
Look, I told you,
I was on parole.

18:10.045 --> 18:13.004
I knew it would look bad.Which part looked bad?

18:13.048 --> 18:15.833
That you'd been convicted
of vehicular manslaughter,

18:15.877 --> 18:19.402
or that you had motive
and opportunity

18:19.446 --> 18:22.013
to kill your ex-girlfriend
Natalie Richards?

18:22.057 --> 18:24.190
Objection, Your Honor.
Badgering the witness.

18:24.233 --> 18:25.539
I withdraw.

18:25.582 --> 18:27.628
No further questions
for this witness.

18:27.671 --> 18:29.238
JUDGE:
Your witness, Mr. Ware.

18:33.068 --> 18:34.113
Mr. Heglund.

18:35.810 --> 18:37.290
...did you kill
Natalie Richards?

18:37.333 --> 18:39.596
No, I never hurt Natalie.

18:39.640 --> 18:42.338
WARE: And did the police ever
accuse you of killing her?

18:42.382 --> 18:43.687
HEGLUND: No.

18:43.731 --> 18:46.081
They-they said
some burglar did it.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.649
You know the plaintiff
in this case, Sam Richards?

18:48.692 --> 18:50.259
Yeah, I know Sam.

18:50.303 --> 18:53.915
He was, uh, Natalie's nephew.
He lived with her.

18:53.958 --> 18:55.917
And can you describe
your relationship

18:55.960 --> 18:58.441
with Sam Richards while
you were dating his aunt?

18:58.485 --> 18:59.964
There wasn't one.

19:00.008 --> 19:02.184
It's hard to get
to know someone

19:02.228 --> 19:03.446
who won't come out
of their bedroom.

19:03.490 --> 19:05.883
And how about after
Natalie's death?

19:05.927 --> 19:07.668
Did you have a relationship
with him then?

19:07.711 --> 19:10.714
Well, I wouldn't call it
a relationship.

19:10.758 --> 19:12.455
He started harassing me.

19:12.499 --> 19:14.196
WARE:
What do you mean?

19:14.240 --> 19:16.459
HEGLUND:
Well, he started telling
anybody who would listen

19:16.503 --> 19:19.114
that I had killed Natalie.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.594
He-he called one of
my bosses,

19:20.637 --> 19:22.857
got me fired
from one of my jobs.

19:22.900 --> 19:26.295
Did he ever threaten
you personally?

19:26.339 --> 19:27.644
Yes. Yes, he did.

19:27.688 --> 19:29.864
He left me messages.

19:29.907 --> 19:31.300
WARE: The defense
would like to enter

19:31.344 --> 19:33.346
a voice mail recording

19:33.389 --> 19:36.479
that Mr. Richards left
Mr. Heglund.

19:36.523 --> 19:38.177
Objection. Your Honor,
this recording

19:38.220 --> 19:39.395
has not been authenticated.

19:39.439 --> 19:40.744
If Mr. Richards were here,

19:40.788 --> 19:41.919
he could authenticate
it himself.

19:41.963 --> 19:43.530
I mean, Mr. Heglund

19:43.573 --> 19:45.575
should not be punished
because the plaintiff

19:45.619 --> 19:47.882
can't be bothered
to show up for a lawsuit

19:47.925 --> 19:49.188
that he filed.

19:52.974 --> 19:54.105
I'll allow it.

19:56.282 --> 19:58.371
SAM: You're gonna regret the day
that you called me

19:58.414 --> 20:01.504
a weird little creep,
because this weird little creep

20:01.548 --> 20:04.420
is gonna make it
his mission in life

20:04.464 --> 20:07.206
to destroy you.

20:09.469 --> 20:12.298
I-I didn't mean it like that.

20:13.603 --> 20:15.823
WARE:
How did you feel when you

20:15.866 --> 20:17.651
received that message?

20:17.694 --> 20:19.305
Scared.

20:19.348 --> 20:21.263
Scared.Mm-hmm.

20:21.307 --> 20:23.787
But you said this
is a guy, he never

20:23.831 --> 20:25.354
leaves his bedroom.

20:25.398 --> 20:28.183
How would you feel if
someone became obsessed

20:28.227 --> 20:29.489
with ruining your life?

20:29.532 --> 20:31.926
Someone you thought
was certifiably crazy?

20:31.969 --> 20:33.493
He got me fired.

20:33.536 --> 20:35.973
Now he's taking me to court.
How does this end?

20:36.017 --> 20:37.627
He hires someone to kill me?

20:37.671 --> 20:39.412
CHUNK:
Objection, Your Honor.

20:39.455 --> 20:41.849
The witness can't just throw
wild speculations out there.

20:41.892 --> 20:45.461
The jury will disregard
the witness' last statement.

20:45.505 --> 20:48.029
WARE: I have no
further questions, Your Honor.

20:48.072 --> 20:50.814
Bull, we've lost
the whole jury.

20:50.858 --> 20:52.860
Yeah. They now see Curt
as the victim,

20:52.903 --> 20:55.689
and Sam as the bad guy.

20:55.732 --> 20:57.299
If you can't get
that kid into court

20:57.343 --> 21:00.737
to change their minds,
we're done.

21:09.006 --> 21:11.922
I'm positive that it was
Curt's voice that I heard.

21:13.446 --> 21:14.969
Uh, he-he was yelling
at my aunt.

21:15.012 --> 21:17.101
He said,
"You went behind my back

21:17.145 --> 21:19.016
with Louis and Frank,
didn't you?"

21:20.409 --> 21:22.411
What happened next?

21:22.455 --> 21:26.981
Uh, Curt started getting rough
with Aunt Natalie.

21:27.024 --> 21:30.898
And then there was
a loud thump.

21:30.941 --> 21:32.943
She went quiet.

21:33.901 --> 21:35.816
Uh, and when I came out,

21:35.859 --> 21:39.646
she was just lying there;
she was gone.

21:39.689 --> 21:42.301
You made it all the way
through that time.

21:42.344 --> 21:45.478
Oh, I... I shouldn't have
left him that message.

21:45.521 --> 21:48.132
But I... no one
would listen to me.

21:48.176 --> 21:52.702
No one believed me.
I-I-I was just so mad.

21:52.746 --> 21:54.487
That is why
it's so important for you

21:54.530 --> 21:58.012
to look this jury in the eye
and tell them the truth.

22:00.101 --> 22:03.234
One more thing
we have to practice today.

22:03.278 --> 22:06.281
Okay.

22:06.325 --> 22:09.980
So what we're gonna do is have
you step up to the threshold,

22:10.024 --> 22:12.505
and then take one step
into the hallway.

22:13.636 --> 22:16.117
Uh...
You can do it.

22:16.160 --> 22:19.207
Just one step.
That's it.

22:20.251 --> 22:22.166
Okay.

22:35.397 --> 22:37.312
You got this, Sam.

22:46.495 --> 22:48.758
I'm...
It's okay.

22:48.802 --> 22:50.673
I-I can't.It's okay.

22:50.717 --> 22:52.327
I-I-I, I'm not ready.

22:52.371 --> 22:54.111
You're okay.

22:57.158 --> 22:58.812
It always feels so good

22:58.855 --> 23:00.727
to stretch my legs
after a flight.[chuckles]

23:00.770 --> 23:02.903
To breathe in the fresh air.
[chuckles]

23:02.946 --> 23:04.818
I don't know how fresh
the city air is,

23:04.861 --> 23:06.515
but if you're happy,
I'm happy.

23:06.559 --> 23:08.735
Any opportunity
to be with you

23:08.778 --> 23:10.127
makes me happy.[chuckles]

23:10.171 --> 23:11.825
Are you gonna be able
to take some time off work

23:11.868 --> 23:13.957
while I'm here?Only on the weekends, Mama.

23:14.001 --> 23:15.350
We're in the middle
of this case.

23:15.394 --> 23:17.134
That's my boy.

23:17.178 --> 23:20.616
Always working, since the day
you were born, you know.

23:20.660 --> 23:24.707
There was football,
school, fashion, law.

23:24.751 --> 23:27.841
And I'm proud of you,
don't get me wrong.Thank you.

23:27.884 --> 23:30.017
But you just get to be my age
and you realize

23:30.060 --> 23:32.193
what's really important.

23:32.236 --> 23:35.414
People. Experiences.

23:35.457 --> 23:37.546
And I want to make sure
that you're not missing out

23:37.590 --> 23:39.156
on the really
great things in life.

23:39.200 --> 23:42.246
No, I'm not.
I'm-- I promise.

23:42.290 --> 23:45.032
My life is full. I have
lots of friends, just...

23:46.250 --> 23:47.817
You know,

23:47.861 --> 23:50.429
lately I've been
hanging a lot with...

23:51.865 --> 23:53.519
...Anna.

23:53.562 --> 23:54.911
[laughs]
Anna?

23:54.955 --> 23:57.000
I know. I follow
her Insta,

23:57.044 --> 23:58.698
and I see you
in those pictures.

23:58.741 --> 24:00.743
I see a lot of other stuff
in that girl's pictures.

24:00.787 --> 24:02.266
Oh, I know.
Mm-hmm.

24:02.310 --> 24:04.617
I think she forgets
her grandmother's watching.

24:04.660 --> 24:06.923
I think she forgets
her daddy's watching, too.

24:06.967 --> 24:08.185
Oh, no.
[laughs]

24:08.229 --> 24:10.840
Good gracious.
[chuckles]

24:18.587 --> 24:21.590
Uh, brownies for breakfast?

24:21.634 --> 24:23.723
I earned it.
I found proof that

24:23.766 --> 24:26.029
the burglar the cops liked
for Natalie Richards' murder

24:26.073 --> 24:28.771
couldn't have done it.What proof?

24:28.815 --> 24:30.512
When the cops
arrested this guy,

24:30.556 --> 24:32.079
he swore he was on
the other side of town

24:32.122 --> 24:33.689
at a gas station
at the time of the murder.

24:33.733 --> 24:36.083
That should be easy to prove.You'd think.

24:36.126 --> 24:38.825
But this gas station didn't have
any working security cameras

24:38.868 --> 24:40.566
and no credit card
transactions in his name.

24:40.609 --> 24:43.525
Well, I got to thinking...
when this guy was busted,

24:43.569 --> 24:45.658
he had a bunch of stolen
credit cards on him.

24:45.701 --> 24:48.399
Oh, so there's a record on
one of the stolen cards?

24:48.443 --> 24:50.097
Not one that went through.

24:50.140 --> 24:52.491
But the cops never checked
for declined credit cards.

24:52.534 --> 24:54.971
Sure enough, one of those
stolen credit cards

24:55.015 --> 24:57.626
was declined at that gas station
at the time of the murder.

24:57.670 --> 24:59.585
That's great.

24:59.628 --> 25:01.369
Lord knows I need
a win this week.

25:01.412 --> 25:03.110
What's going on?

25:03.153 --> 25:04.633
My mother's in town.

25:04.677 --> 25:07.157
You guys have
a tough relationship?

25:07.201 --> 25:10.334
No, no. It's great.
[chuckles]

25:10.378 --> 25:11.727
At least on the surface.

25:12.728 --> 25:14.817
Look, that woman is
the reason why

25:14.861 --> 25:17.341
I am who I am today.

25:17.385 --> 25:19.518
I mean, money would get tight,
she'd take extra shifts,

25:19.561 --> 25:21.302
and she still never missed
a football game.

25:21.345 --> 25:23.522
She never let me shirk
my homework.

25:23.565 --> 25:25.524
I swear, the woman could
go into a grocery store

25:25.567 --> 25:27.874
with ten dollars,
and come out with a feast.

25:27.917 --> 25:29.832
That's mom magic.
Yeah.

25:29.876 --> 25:33.749
But then there was the day
that I told her that I was gay.

25:33.793 --> 25:36.665
And she didn't say
anything bad.

25:36.709 --> 25:40.190
We didn't fight.
It was-- It was a look.

25:41.801 --> 25:43.759
That look of disappointment.

25:46.675 --> 25:48.198
That look hurt.

25:49.373 --> 25:51.985
Mm. I'm so sorry.

25:52.028 --> 25:53.856
I just decided I was gonna keep

25:53.900 --> 25:55.858
that part of myself to myself.

25:55.902 --> 25:59.035
And, God, I've been so busy
pursuing my careers

25:59.079 --> 26:01.211
and reuniting with my daughter.

26:01.255 --> 26:03.736
I didn't have time for
a serious relationship,

26:03.779 --> 26:07.304
and that made it easy, and...
and now...

26:07.348 --> 26:09.393
And now you have Rob.

26:09.437 --> 26:12.179
And he's becoming more
and more important to me.

26:12.222 --> 26:14.137
And I want to introduce him

26:14.181 --> 26:16.444
to the woman
that made me me.

26:16.487 --> 26:18.141
And you don't feel like you can?

26:18.185 --> 26:21.318
It's like there's a door
between us,

26:21.362 --> 26:24.408
and I keep waiting for her
to open it.

26:24.452 --> 26:27.107
But I'm also scared of
what'll happen if she does.

26:27.150 --> 26:30.066
Maybe you've gotta stop
waiting for her to open it.

26:30.110 --> 26:32.373
Maybe you're the one

26:32.416 --> 26:34.549
who needs to invite her in.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.595
Hmm.

26:37.639 --> 26:39.032
Yeah.

26:41.382 --> 26:43.514
Maybe.

26:43.558 --> 26:46.256
BULL:
Now that Heglund can't
point a finger at the burglar,

26:46.300 --> 26:48.563
the jury's gonna take
a real hard look at him.

26:48.607 --> 26:51.348
I just wish we were following
up with Sam's testimony.

26:51.392 --> 26:53.699
Yeah. Well, he is not
quite ready yet,

26:53.742 --> 26:55.918
but we'll use him as
a rebuttal witness,

26:55.962 --> 26:58.094
finish strong.Hey.

26:58.138 --> 26:59.530
Sorry to interrupt.

26:59.574 --> 27:01.228
Got an updated
witness list for you.

27:03.534 --> 27:04.971
And who is Deborah Carter?

27:05.014 --> 27:06.537
And why are we just
hearing about her now?

27:06.581 --> 27:08.757
Ms. Carter's a friend
of the deceased.

27:08.801 --> 27:10.629
She read a post about the case,

27:10.672 --> 27:12.413
just contacted us
this morning.

27:12.456 --> 27:14.763
She believes she knows
who really killed Natalie.

27:17.723 --> 27:22.292
Ms. Carter, you were
released from prison

27:22.336 --> 27:23.293
not too long ago.

27:23.337 --> 27:25.034
Yes. I did three years

27:25.078 --> 27:26.035
for social security fraud.

27:26.079 --> 27:29.343
But you didn't act alone,

27:29.386 --> 27:31.562
did you?No.

27:31.606 --> 27:33.303
Natalie Richards was
my partner.

27:33.347 --> 27:34.957
Objection. Relevance?

27:35.001 --> 27:36.872
I am getting to that,
Your Honor.

27:36.916 --> 27:39.570
I'll allow it,

27:39.614 --> 27:40.746
but tread carefully.

27:42.573 --> 27:44.532
Could you tell us how
this-this fraud worked?

27:44.575 --> 27:46.708
I had a check cashing business.

27:46.752 --> 27:49.015
Natalie owned a building

27:49.058 --> 27:51.321
that catered to
older residents.

27:51.365 --> 27:53.933
When they died,
she intercepted

27:53.976 --> 27:57.066
their social security checks,
and I cashed them.

27:57.110 --> 27:59.373
And whose idea was
this scheme?

27:59.416 --> 28:01.157
Natalie's.

28:01.201 --> 28:02.681
She said she needed
extra money

28:02.724 --> 28:04.291
to take care of
her sister's kid.

28:04.334 --> 28:06.859
He wasn't right
in the head.

28:06.902 --> 28:08.643
And she was worried that
he was never gonna be able

28:08.687 --> 28:09.862
to hold down a job.

28:09.905 --> 28:12.168
She was stealing money
for me?

28:12.212 --> 28:15.084
After a while,
I wanted to quit.

28:15.128 --> 28:17.043
Natalie said she couldn't

28:17.086 --> 28:18.958
'cause of that kid.

28:19.001 --> 28:21.743
WARE:
Why did you want to quit?

28:21.787 --> 28:23.397
CARTER:
It was getting dangerous.

28:23.440 --> 28:25.965
The Russian mob operated
in our neighborhood.

28:26.008 --> 28:27.749
They wanted a cut.

28:27.793 --> 28:29.403
I was getting threatening
phone calls.

28:29.446 --> 28:32.536
I warned Natalie that
she was gonna get hurt,

28:32.580 --> 28:33.842
and look what happened.

28:36.279 --> 28:37.846
No further questions,
Your Honor.

28:37.890 --> 28:40.370
She's killing our case.

28:40.414 --> 28:42.851
I'm more worried
about someone else.

28:48.291 --> 28:50.076
Taylor, put Sam on the phone.

28:50.119 --> 28:52.513
I can't. He kicked me out
and shut the door.

28:52.556 --> 28:54.080
He says he's never
opening it again.

28:54.123 --> 28:55.734
[exhales sharply]

29:00.695 --> 29:02.218
After a while,
I wanted to quit,

29:02.262 --> 29:04.133
and Natalie said she couldn't.

29:07.615 --> 29:09.486
How's Sam?

29:09.530 --> 29:10.836
I don't know.

29:10.879 --> 29:13.229
I went over there,
but he wouldn't let me in.

29:13.273 --> 29:15.928
Oh, I'm sorry, baby.

29:16.885 --> 29:19.409
[sighs]
I was so close.

29:19.453 --> 29:21.803
He was almost ready
to leave his apartment,

29:21.847 --> 29:25.589
but now he blames himself
even more.

29:25.633 --> 29:27.156
Not just for Natalie's death,

29:27.200 --> 29:29.898
but also for being a burden,

29:29.942 --> 29:31.726
that she became a criminal.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.293
I feel like Sam's
not the only one

29:33.336 --> 29:35.512
blaming himself right now.

29:36.862 --> 29:40.430
When he was a kid, I had him
draw a picture of himself

29:40.474 --> 29:42.128
as he wished he could be.

29:42.171 --> 29:45.087
Most kids draw pictures
of themselves

29:45.131 --> 29:49.396
on a pirate ship or flying
or in a space ship.

29:49.439 --> 29:54.009
He just drew a picture
of himself with a smile,

29:54.053 --> 29:57.447
as a happy kid, unafraid.

29:57.491 --> 29:59.275
That's all he wanted to be.

30:00.581 --> 30:02.191
Poor kid.

30:03.453 --> 30:05.804
I didn't help him then,

30:05.847 --> 30:09.068
and now this case might be
the worst thing for him.

30:09.111 --> 30:10.721
You think you're
gonna lose?

30:10.765 --> 30:14.377
Well, this woman's testimony
did a real number on us.

30:14.421 --> 30:17.119
She told the jury that
Natalie got herself killed

30:17.163 --> 30:18.425
because she was a criminal.

30:18.468 --> 30:20.470
You don't believe her?Well...

30:20.514 --> 30:22.603
she's not lying about
the social security scam,

30:22.646 --> 30:26.085
but there is something off
about her testimony for sure.

30:26.128 --> 30:27.521
Off how?

30:27.564 --> 30:29.479
Right after we eliminate
the burglar,

30:29.523 --> 30:32.613
leaving Curt Heglund
the only suspect,

30:32.656 --> 30:34.615
this woman shows up
to point a finger

30:34.658 --> 30:36.138
at the Russian mob?

30:36.182 --> 30:37.705
It's too perfect.

30:37.748 --> 30:39.576
Well, I can't say anything
about her timing,

30:39.620 --> 30:41.274
but she's got expensive taste.

30:41.317 --> 30:43.406
Those are $800 earrings
she's wearing.

30:43.450 --> 30:44.712
Seriously?

30:44.755 --> 30:46.148
Yeah. My client
designs them.

30:48.324 --> 30:50.805
Wow. Thank you.

30:53.025 --> 30:55.941
Taylor, it's not over yet.

30:57.768 --> 30:59.988
Mama, you didn't have
to do all this.

31:00.032 --> 31:01.598
This is your vacation.
I'm the one that's

31:01.642 --> 31:02.599
supposed to be the host.

31:02.643 --> 31:04.427
Listen,

31:04.471 --> 31:07.909
when you were growing up,
I felt like I was always

31:07.953 --> 31:09.693
cooking one meal
or another.

31:09.737 --> 31:11.260
Mm.
And now I kind of miss it.

31:11.304 --> 31:12.827
Well...

31:12.871 --> 31:14.524
I want to cook for you
on Saturday night.

31:14.568 --> 31:16.918
Really? What's the occasion?Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

31:16.962 --> 31:19.312
Well, there's somebody
I want you to meet.

31:19.355 --> 31:20.879
His name's Rob.

31:24.186 --> 31:27.102
And we've been seeing each other
for a couple months.

31:27.146 --> 31:29.409
I see.

31:29.452 --> 31:33.935
Look, I know we don't
talk about this.

31:33.979 --> 31:36.024
It's who I am.

31:36.068 --> 31:38.374
And I'm sorry if that makes you
feel uncomfortable,

31:38.418 --> 31:39.506
but this is who I am.

31:39.549 --> 31:42.422
Who said I was uncomfortable?

31:42.465 --> 31:43.597
You did.

31:43.640 --> 31:45.773
The day I told you.

31:45.816 --> 31:47.557
I saw the look
on your face, Mama.

31:47.601 --> 31:50.256
Is this the story
you tell yourself?

31:51.910 --> 31:54.303
That your mother
doesn't accept you?

31:54.347 --> 31:56.392
That's not what I said.

31:56.436 --> 31:57.959
You didn't have to.

32:01.267 --> 32:02.790
[door shuts]

32:04.226 --> 32:06.750
I scoured Deborah Carter's
finances looking for proof

32:06.794 --> 32:08.665
that she got paid
for her testimony,

32:08.709 --> 32:11.755
but I didn't find any mysterious
deposits to her accounts.

32:11.799 --> 32:15.237
So I went through her finances
the old-fashioned way.

32:15.281 --> 32:16.630
Dumpster dive.

32:16.673 --> 32:18.240
Someone's been on
a shopping spree.

32:18.284 --> 32:19.850
I found receipts
for designer bags,

32:19.894 --> 32:21.635
shoes, clothes,
all in cash.

32:21.678 --> 32:23.245
Well, I don't think
a few cash purchases

32:23.289 --> 32:24.681
are gonna make a difference.

32:24.725 --> 32:28.250
We need something concrete
that can tie

32:28.294 --> 32:29.860
Curt Heglund to Deborah Carter.

32:29.904 --> 32:31.384
Hold your horses.

32:31.427 --> 32:33.081
I can't connect Curt to Deborah
in the now,

32:33.125 --> 32:36.041
but a look in the past...

32:36.084 --> 32:38.130
Curt Heglund and Deborah Carter

32:38.173 --> 32:40.262
have known each other
since high school.

32:40.306 --> 32:42.003
Looks like Curt called in
an old friend

32:42.047 --> 32:43.613
to take the heat off him.

32:43.657 --> 32:47.617
What if Curt was involved
in the social security scam?

32:47.661 --> 32:48.923
The jury now believes

32:48.967 --> 32:51.186
that Natalie died
because of this scam.

32:51.230 --> 32:53.580
If we prove
Curt was involved,

32:53.623 --> 32:55.190
I think we can
convince the jury

32:55.234 --> 32:57.279
that he was the killer.Okay. Well,

32:57.323 --> 33:00.152
these are the people we know
Natalie and Deborah defrauded.

33:00.195 --> 33:02.719
A few of the men weren't
from Natalie's building,

33:02.763 --> 33:05.853
so Curt could have targeted them
in some other way, let's see.

33:07.420 --> 33:09.683
Nope. William Frank was
from the building.

33:09.726 --> 33:11.554
Not Gerald Louis either.

33:11.598 --> 33:13.252
You know what, let me
dig into this and see what...

33:13.295 --> 33:16.211
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Frank and Louis?

33:16.255 --> 33:17.604
Yeah.

33:19.084 --> 33:20.737
Those are the guys
that Sam said

33:20.781 --> 33:23.044
Curt accused Natalie of
going behind his back with.

33:23.088 --> 33:26.743
They--
They're not boyfriends.

33:26.787 --> 33:28.136
I think they're victims.

33:28.180 --> 33:30.965
Won't you need Sam
to testify to that?

33:31.009 --> 33:33.011
Last I heard, he still won't
leave his apartment.

33:33.054 --> 33:34.708
Tell Chunk to buy us
some time with the judge.

33:34.751 --> 33:36.884
Taylor, please come with me.

33:39.713 --> 33:41.062
[knocking at door]

33:41.106 --> 33:42.933
Sam?

33:44.544 --> 33:48.156
You were right,
more than you know.

33:48.200 --> 33:49.331
Curt was part of the fraud.

33:49.375 --> 33:51.029
That's why he killed your aunt.

33:51.072 --> 33:53.031
But you're the only one
that can prove it.

33:53.074 --> 33:55.294
You're the only one who can
get justice for Natalie.

33:55.337 --> 33:57.122
SAM: It was because of me
she got mixed up

33:57.165 --> 33:58.558
in all that stuff
in the first place.

33:58.601 --> 34:00.125
It-It's my fault.

34:00.168 --> 34:01.909
If that's how you feel,
don't you think it's time

34:01.952 --> 34:04.346
you apologize to your aunt?

34:04.390 --> 34:07.306
SAM:
What? How?

34:07.349 --> 34:09.743
Open the door, Sam.

34:09.786 --> 34:11.832
[locks unlocking]

34:19.318 --> 34:22.060
This isn't gonna
make a difference.

34:22.103 --> 34:25.019
Uh, it's not real.
She's not Aunt Natalie.

34:25.063 --> 34:28.153
The feelings are real.
The words are real.

34:28.196 --> 34:29.676
Oh, what's it gonna change?

34:29.719 --> 34:32.200
You probably don't
remember this, but...

34:32.244 --> 34:34.681
when you were a kid,

34:34.724 --> 34:37.423
I had you draw me a picture
of what you wanted to be...

34:37.466 --> 34:39.381
Well, I'm not a kid anymore.

34:39.425 --> 34:41.949
All right? I don't want
to draw pictures

34:41.992 --> 34:44.125
or role-play.

34:44.169 --> 34:46.867
The day you drew that picture
was the last day I treated you.

34:46.910 --> 34:50.392
And I wish I had tried harder
to convince your aunt

34:50.436 --> 34:53.091
to keep you in treatment.

34:55.615 --> 34:57.791
And I am very sorry

34:57.834 --> 35:00.446
that I wasn't able
to help you more, Sam.

35:00.489 --> 35:03.013
We're the ones who quit. It...

35:03.057 --> 35:04.667
It wasn't your fault.

35:04.711 --> 35:08.062
Doesn't change how real
my guilt feels to me.

35:08.106 --> 35:11.109
I'll tell you one thing.

35:11.152 --> 35:13.763
It helps to say it out loud.

35:20.205 --> 35:21.554
Um...

35:21.597 --> 35:23.338
I'm...

35:25.079 --> 35:27.777
I'm sorry.

35:27.821 --> 35:32.956
I'm sorry that I couldn't...
come out of my room that night.

35:33.000 --> 35:36.177
And I'm sorry
that I was a...

35:36.221 --> 35:38.962
a burden on you;

35:39.006 --> 35:42.052
that I was so hard to raise.

35:42.096 --> 35:44.620
I was always afraid.

35:44.664 --> 35:49.364
Sam, you have nothing
to be sorry for.I tried to help.

35:49.408 --> 35:51.584
TAYLOR:Look at everything
you've done.

35:51.627 --> 35:54.978
For six years,
when no one believed you,

35:55.022 --> 35:56.241
you didn't give up.

35:56.284 --> 35:59.026
You found the video,
you found Bull.

35:59.069 --> 36:00.897
You should be proud.

36:01.898 --> 36:03.726
I'm proud of you.

36:06.033 --> 36:08.122
It's up to you
if you want to testify.

36:08.166 --> 36:10.690
But if you do...

36:10.733 --> 36:12.344
it's got to be today.

36:19.655 --> 36:22.528
Where is your client,
Mr. Palmer?

36:22.571 --> 36:24.573
Your Honor,
he will be here.

36:24.617 --> 36:27.881
Something must have happened.
They probably hit traffic.

36:27.924 --> 36:30.666
I granted you a continuance
for this morning.

36:30.710 --> 36:32.842
There won't be another one
this afternoon.

36:34.061 --> 36:35.454
Understood, Your Honor.

36:36.846 --> 36:39.197
Then I believe it is time
for closing arguments.[door opens]

36:40.894 --> 36:42.809
[gallery murmuring]

36:45.290 --> 36:47.770
Your Honor,
my client is here.

36:48.858 --> 36:50.251
Here we go.

36:57.127 --> 36:59.434
CHUNK: State your name
for the record, please.

37:07.964 --> 37:09.749

37:17.800 --> 37:20.194
Um...

37:20.238 --> 37:22.762
My name is Sam Richards.

37:22.805 --> 37:25.155
Thank you.

37:25.199 --> 37:28.071
Now, Sam, were you
in the apartment

37:28.115 --> 37:30.030
the night that your aunt
was murdered?

37:30.073 --> 37:33.294
Yes, I was.

37:33.338 --> 37:36.384
And did you hear the person

37:36.428 --> 37:38.517
who killed your aunt?

37:38.560 --> 37:40.823
Yes, I did.

37:40.867 --> 37:44.653
Can you identify
that person today?

37:49.832 --> 37:51.878
Yes.

37:51.921 --> 37:55.577
It was that man,
Curt Heglund.

38:07.110 --> 38:09.243
Has the jury reached
a verdict?

38:10.418 --> 38:12.942
"We the jury find
the defendant,

38:12.986 --> 38:15.293
"Curt Heglund, liable

38:15.336 --> 38:17.251
"in the death of
Natalie Richards,

38:17.295 --> 38:20.907
and award the plaintiff
$200,000 in damages."

38:20.950 --> 38:22.517
[exhales]
[exhales]

38:23.823 --> 38:25.912
You did it.

38:30.656 --> 38:32.222
HEGLUND: You can tell
that kid this verdict

38:32.266 --> 38:33.746
don't mean a damn thing.

38:33.789 --> 38:36.531
He won't see a dime.CHUNK:
But the D.A. seems

38:36.575 --> 38:38.228
awfully interested in
all that evidence

38:38.272 --> 38:39.578
that Sam provided.

38:39.621 --> 38:41.144
So I'd worry about yourself,
'cause I think

38:41.188 --> 38:42.320
Sam's gonna be just fine.

38:50.415 --> 38:52.895
[sighs]

38:52.939 --> 38:54.332
Let's just get started.

38:54.375 --> 38:55.594
No, no, we're just
a few minutes past.

38:55.637 --> 38:56.986
Let's just wait
a little bit longer.

38:57.944 --> 38:59.641
No, come on, let's eat.

39:02.209 --> 39:03.906
You tried. That counts
for a lot, okay?

39:23.535 --> 39:24.971
Order for Ms. Boyd.

39:25.014 --> 39:27.887
Oh, no. Wrong apartment.
She's one flight up.

39:31.499 --> 39:32.718
Mama?

39:32.761 --> 39:34.415
What are you doing out here?

39:34.459 --> 39:36.417
Beating myself up.

39:39.768 --> 39:40.943
Mama, I'm sorry.

39:40.987 --> 39:43.381
I know you love me.
And I love you.

39:43.424 --> 39:45.513
I just don't want there
to be anything that we

39:45.557 --> 39:47.863
have to tiptoe around.

39:47.907 --> 39:50.388
I want to be my whole self
with you.

39:50.431 --> 39:52.520
Don't you think
I want that, too?

39:52.564 --> 39:56.481
Honestly... I'm not so sure.

39:57.917 --> 40:00.310
That look that you saw
on my face

40:00.354 --> 40:02.530
when you told me
that you were gay,

40:02.574 --> 40:04.793
that was not
disappointment, baby.

40:04.837 --> 40:06.665
That was fear.

40:06.708 --> 40:08.884
I was afraid for you.
Afraid...

40:08.928 --> 40:10.843
that life was going
to get harder for you.

40:10.886 --> 40:13.149
Harder than it was
already going to be.

40:13.193 --> 40:15.456
Well, why didn't you just
say that in the first place?

40:15.500 --> 40:17.458
Because you were already
going through so much.

40:17.502 --> 40:19.417
I didn't want to add
my worries to yours.

40:19.460 --> 40:22.898
So I just shut it down.

40:24.247 --> 40:28.687
But I ended up shutting out
a part of you when I did that.

And I am sorry.
