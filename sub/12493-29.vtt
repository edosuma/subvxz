00:03.709 --> 00:04.709
Great news, everybody!

00:04.792 --> 00:07.583
This year for once, I don't have to
work on Thanksgiving.

00:09.125 --> 00:10.500
So, we can all be together!

00:11.709 --> 00:13.250
And I can cook Thanksgiving dinner.

00:13.375 --> 00:14.834
Teddy: All right.

00:14.917 --> 00:15.792
Yay.

00:19.250 --> 00:20.542
Okay, what happened there?

00:21.208 --> 00:24.375
Honey, come on, it's just that cooking
Thanksgiving dinner is a lot of work.

00:24.458 --> 00:26.667
Yeah, are you sure we shouldn't
just eat out?

00:27.250 --> 00:28.375
I mean, for your sake.

00:29.417 --> 00:30.458
No way.

00:30.542 --> 00:32.750
Every Thanksgiving
I have to eat turkey sandwiches

00:32.834 --> 00:34.458
out of the hospital vending machine

00:34.542 --> 00:36.542
and you guys have to go to the
Old Tyme Buffet.

00:37.208 --> 00:39.083
This year we're gonna be together,

00:39.417 --> 00:40.625
and I am gonna cook.

00:41.625 --> 00:43.917
Old Tyme Buffet offers quality and value.

00:46.208 --> 00:46.917
Yeah...

00:47.041 --> 00:48.542
and their chicken fingers?

00:48.625 --> 00:49.625
Mmm

00:49.917 --> 00:50.792
Right?

00:52.250 --> 00:54.333
We are having dinner here
and that is final.

00:55.500 --> 00:56.375
All right.

00:56.750 --> 00:57.709
Okay.

00:58.250 --> 01:00.250
Actually, you know,
I have a Thanksgiving announcement.

01:00.375 --> 01:02.834
This year we are going to be
joined by grandpa.

01:05.083 --> 01:06.166
Grandpa Duncan.

01:06.834 --> 01:07.959
Yeah.

01:10.917 --> 01:11.959
Hurts, doesn't it?

01:13.667 --> 01:14.834
Oh, come on, you guys.

01:14.917 --> 01:16.208
My dad has some good qualities.

01:16.792 --> 01:17.875
Such as?

01:17.959 --> 01:21.333
You know what? He exhales Carbon Dioxide,
which is needed by plants.

01:23.208 --> 01:25.250
All right well, we've got bigger problems.

01:25.750 --> 01:27.250
Mom's cooking Thanksgiving dinner.

01:27.625 --> 01:30.458
Oh, no, no, no.

01:31.083 --> 01:33.041
The best chef in the house,

01:33.333 --> 01:34.208
PJ...

01:34.250 --> 01:35.875
Is cooking Thanksgiving dinner.

01:35.959 --> 01:37.458
I am? She's never gonna let me.

01:37.792 --> 01:39.208
That's why you have to trick her.

01:39.542 --> 01:41.333
Give her the illusion that she's cooking,

01:41.417 --> 01:43.917
when in reality, you're the one
doing all the work.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.250
Yeah. Got it, got it.

01:45.792 --> 01:47.125
Um, just one question.

01:47.709 --> 01:49.000
What does illusion mean?

01:51.041 --> 01:52.250
Three words...

01:52.333 --> 01:54.083
Cook Thanksgiving dinner.

01:55.375 --> 01:56.500
Right now?

01:58.667 --> 01:59.750
Relax, Dad.

02:00.041 --> 02:01.041
Just messing with you.

02:01.542 --> 02:02.709
Oh, by the way, Thanksgiving...

03:05.917 --> 03:07.250

03:08.041 --> 03:09.583
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

03:09.667 --> 03:12.125
It look, It looks a bit more
like mashed potatoes.

03:13.500 --> 03:15.959
Look, big Thanksgiving sale
at The Gizmo Hut.

03:16.959 --> 03:19.750
They're selling MyTabs for $49?
That's awesome!

03:19.834 --> 03:21.959
I know! But we have to get in line early

03:22.041 --> 03:23.917
because they'll only have ten
of these at that price.

03:24.542 --> 03:27.250
So, we have to wait in line
on Thanksgiving day?

03:27.709 --> 03:29.625
Yes, the sale starts at midnight.

03:30.125 --> 03:31.709
Why did they have to make it so hard?

03:31.792 --> 03:35.250
All we wanna do is celebrate
the true meaning of Thanksgiving...

03:35.417 --> 03:37.834
buying electronics at terrific prices.

03:38.750 --> 03:39.750
I'm saying.

03:41.458 --> 03:42.458
Charlie: Turkey.

03:59.041 --> 04:01.959
Why do you always answer
the door when I come over?

04:02.291 --> 04:04.959
How about you stop coming over
and I'll stop answering the door?

04:07.959 --> 04:09.333
Hi, Mrs. Dabney.

04:09.417 --> 04:11.458
Amy, I have a question for you.

04:11.709 --> 04:14.375
Do you know where I can
get a small turkey for one?

04:14.750 --> 04:15.959
It's just me this year.

04:16.458 --> 04:17.792
Oh, well, where's Mr. Dabney?

04:18.083 --> 04:19.125
Didn't you hear?

04:19.375 --> 04:20.959
I divorced his sorry butt.

04:22.166 --> 04:24.250
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.

04:24.375 --> 04:27.250
I'm not. We were just making
each other miserable.

04:27.333 --> 04:30.458
Now, I can be the happy-go-lucky
person I always was.

04:32.458 --> 04:33.333
You are?

04:33.417 --> 04:35.083
I mean... I mean, you can.

04:36.500 --> 04:37.458
You are?

04:38.875 --> 04:40.875
So... anyway,

04:41.709 --> 04:46.000
I'll be eating that tiny turkey
in that big empty house,

04:46.083 --> 04:47.083
all alone...

04:47.709 --> 04:48.709
by myself...

04:49.667 --> 04:50.792
just me.

04:52.375 --> 04:54.542
Well, it'll be good practice
for Christmas.

04:56.500 --> 04:57.625
After you.

04:58.083 --> 04:59.000
Um...

04:59.083 --> 05:00.208
Mrs. Dabney,

05:00.250 --> 05:01.583
would you like to--

05:05.959 --> 05:09.000
Mrs. Dabney, would you like to join us
for Thanksgiving dinner?

05:09.333 --> 05:10.375
Well,

05:10.458 --> 05:11.792
this is coming out of nowhere.

05:14.250 --> 05:15.792
I'll have to check my schedule.

05:17.625 --> 05:18.500
Bye now.

05:23.417 --> 05:24.625
Why did you do that?

05:26.166 --> 05:28.625
I was being gracious
and I was being neighborly.

05:29.375 --> 05:31.166
All right, well, that better end
by Christmas.

05:39.333 --> 05:40.208
Hey, mom,

05:40.583 --> 05:41.500
what you got there?

05:41.583 --> 05:43.083
Oh, It's the menu for Thanksgiving.

05:43.166 --> 05:46.500
Talk about great timing because
I was gonna volunteer to help you cook.

05:46.583 --> 05:48.959
Aww, PJ, that is so sweet,
but actually I was gonna ask Teddy.

05:49.375 --> 05:51.333
Mom, Teddy does not have time.

05:51.625 --> 05:54.208
She is off in her own
little world with the...

05:54.333 --> 05:56.041
dolls and the horses and the...

05:56.500 --> 05:57.500
dress-up.

05:59.583 --> 06:01.291
You do know she's not seven, right?

06:03.750 --> 06:05.125
Whatever. Let me see the list.

06:06.083 --> 06:09.625
Okay, I'm just gonna put a little check
next to the things I like to cook.

06:10.250 --> 06:12.709
Yeah, yes. Ooh, definitely.

06:13.166 --> 06:15.458
Oh, oh, oh, yeah.

06:15.875 --> 06:18.291
Honey, you checked
everything but the rolls.

06:18.375 --> 06:19.458
Oh, right, sorry.

06:20.041 --> 06:21.041
"Rolls."

06:21.917 --> 06:23.709
Okay, fine, you can cook
all that other stuff,

06:23.792 --> 06:25.709
but I am definitely cooking the turkey.

06:26.542 --> 06:27.834
Wait, that wasn't on the list.

06:27.917 --> 06:29.583
Well, I thought it was obvious.

06:32.250 --> 06:34.750
I got bogged down on the side dishes,
lost my focus.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.125
- So?
- Oh.

06:39.208 --> 06:40.667
How did it go?

06:43.083 --> 06:44.583
I've got some bad news.

06:44.875 --> 06:45.750
What?

06:46.208 --> 06:47.792
She's making one dish.

06:48.917 --> 06:50.917
Please say broccoli. Please say broccoli.

06:52.625 --> 06:53.625
It...

06:53.709 --> 06:55.458
rhymes with schmurkey.

06:56.500 --> 06:57.709
It's turkey.

07:03.083 --> 07:04.917
- Hey, everybody, grandpa's here.
- Kids: Hey!

07:05.000 --> 07:06.500
- Hey!
- Teddy: Hi, Grandpa!

07:06.583 --> 07:09.250
Yeah, yeah. My, how you've grown.
Blah, blah, blah.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.125
I don't believe you've met Charlie.

07:15.792 --> 07:17.375
Now why is he dressed like a girl?

07:18.166 --> 07:20.500
Well, because she is a girl.

07:20.583 --> 07:22.500
Yes, Charlie is short for Charlotte.

07:22.583 --> 07:24.750
Then why isn't she called Sharlie?

07:28.375 --> 07:29.917
Seriously, I don't get it.

07:30.542 --> 07:32.000
You give the girls boys' names.

07:32.083 --> 07:35.291
He should be Teddy, he should be Charlie,
and she should be PJ.

07:35.375 --> 07:37.083
We're not renaming the kids, Dad.

07:39.750 --> 07:40.750
Good news.

07:40.834 --> 07:44.625
I checked my schedule, and it turns out,
I am available on Thanksgiving.

07:45.250 --> 07:46.750
All right, really? Who left the door open?

07:47.917 --> 07:50.166
Mrs. Dabney, this is my father-in-law,
Frank Duncan.

07:50.250 --> 07:51.625
Frank, Estelle Dabney.

07:53.333 --> 07:56.917
Bob, I was wondering if you could
come over and look at my garbage disposal.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
- It's not working right.
- Oh, I'll do it.

07:59.709 --> 08:01.709
Had my own plumbing business for 30 years.

08:02.417 --> 08:04.458
Plumbing, now, that's a man's job.

08:05.041 --> 08:06.750
You want someone to catch a butterfly,

08:07.583 --> 08:08.792
call my son.

08:09.041 --> 08:10.125
Let's go.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.917
Yes, we're numbers nine and ten!

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
Ha!

08:22.041 --> 08:23.333
- You're nine and I'm ten?
- Yeah.

08:23.709 --> 08:25.000
Why don't I get to be nine?

08:25.875 --> 08:28.041
Well, what difference does it make?
We're both getting MyTabs.

08:28.125 --> 08:29.333
Then I'm nine.

08:31.500 --> 08:32.542
Oh, great.

08:32.750 --> 08:36.417
I gotta spend the rest of the day in line
behind you two losers.

08:36.959 --> 08:38.166
Well, well, well,

08:38.500 --> 08:40.625
if it isn't Karl, the neighborhood jerk.

08:42.375 --> 08:45.041
If you were planning on getting a MyTab,
you're out of luck.

08:45.125 --> 08:46.583
You're number 11.

08:46.667 --> 08:48.250
Not if I outrun you.

08:48.542 --> 08:51.917
And when I get my MyTab,
I'm gonna go online to the losers site

08:52.000 --> 08:54.709
and post something
on your loser page that says,

08:54.959 --> 08:56.000
"Hey, loser!"

08:58.250 --> 08:59.917
This is gonna be a long day.

09:00.542 --> 09:03.542
Excuse me, Karl. I'm gonna zip up
the invisible wall now

09:03.667 --> 09:05.000
so we don't have to listen to you.

09:07.583 --> 09:09.041
You can still hear me.

09:10.834 --> 09:12.000
I know you can.

09:13.250 --> 09:15.250
Hey, invisible wall's stupid!

09:16.041 --> 09:17.500
I'm sorry, what?

09:20.250 --> 09:22.959
T, you should get going so you can make it
home for your Thanksgiving dinner.

09:23.041 --> 09:25.750
Yeah, you're right. Well, I'll be back
at 4:00 so you can go to your dinner.

09:25.834 --> 09:27.208
- See ya.
- Okay. See ya.

09:29.375 --> 09:30.542
Hey, Ivy.

09:31.417 --> 09:32.583
Now that Teddy's gone,

09:33.166 --> 09:34.333
I can finally admit that...

09:34.959 --> 09:36.000
I'm not really a jerk.

09:37.208 --> 09:39.834
I'm just a vulnerable kid
who's too scared to admit

09:39.917 --> 09:40.750
that...

09:41.417 --> 09:42.667
he needs a friend.

09:42.750 --> 09:43.583
Oh, really?

09:44.083 --> 09:45.083
No.

09:45.166 --> 09:46.125
I'm a jerk.

09:46.542 --> 09:47.709
Loser!

09:50.959 --> 09:53.250
Yep, a real long day.

10:01.583 --> 10:04.083
Oh, man, this is just weird.

10:06.291 --> 10:07.750
- What is?
- Grandpa.

10:08.417 --> 10:09.542
He seems happy.

10:10.041 --> 10:11.208
It's very unsettling.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.291
Peek-a-boo, I see you.

10:15.125 --> 10:16.333
Peek-a-boo.

10:18.792 --> 10:21.250
All right, you know what?
We'd better go make sure he's okay.

10:22.583 --> 10:24.667
Here we go. I'm gonna get ya!

10:24.750 --> 10:26.291
Here we go. I'm gonna get ya!

10:26.333 --> 10:28.625
Here he comes. Whooo!

10:29.125 --> 10:30.959
Oh, she's a cutie pie!

10:31.583 --> 10:34.208
And you were cute, too, when you were
at that age, Gabe. Boop.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.041
Happy Thanksgiving, everyone!

10:40.959 --> 10:42.125
Happy...

10:42.208 --> 10:43.333
Thanks...

10:43.417 --> 10:44.500
giving.

10:46.417 --> 10:47.875
She's acting weird, too?

10:47.959 --> 10:49.709
Okay, something's not right.

10:50.041 --> 10:51.959
This is such a wonderful day.

10:52.041 --> 10:54.667
I have so much to be thankful for.

10:54.750 --> 10:56.083
Like what?

10:56.166 --> 10:57.083
Well,

10:57.166 --> 11:00.333
I am thankful that I have
a new man in my life.

11:00.417 --> 11:03.375
And I am thankful to be that man.

11:12.583 --> 11:13.959
Um... so...

11:14.709 --> 11:16.250
uh, you two are together now?

11:16.375 --> 11:17.542
That's right.

11:17.667 --> 11:20.125
After frank unclogged my disposal...

11:23.417 --> 11:25.542
He unclogged my heart.

11:26.667 --> 11:29.125
So, it looks like I'll be sticking around

11:29.792 --> 11:30.917
for a while.

11:33.125 --> 11:34.500
And who knows, Gabe?

11:34.583 --> 11:35.792
Someday soon,

11:35.875 --> 11:37.750
you might be calling me Grandma.

11:40.125 --> 11:41.750
Gabe...

11:42.375 --> 11:43.375
let's go for a catch.

11:43.959 --> 11:45.750
- A what?
- Just go outside.

11:53.333 --> 11:54.208
Oh, All right.

11:54.750 --> 11:55.875
What are we gonna do?

11:56.250 --> 11:58.542
Well, there's only one thing we can do.
We gotta split 'em up.

11:59.542 --> 12:00.458
Oh,

12:00.542 --> 12:01.917
that sounds evil.

12:02.500 --> 12:03.583
I like it.

12:04.959 --> 12:06.667
Hey, you know what?

12:07.250 --> 12:09.583
All we have to do is just help them
to get to know each other.

12:09.667 --> 12:11.041
I mean, once we do that...

12:11.500 --> 12:12.583
Then they'll hate each other.

12:12.667 --> 12:14.500
- Exactly.
- Yeah!

12:15.125 --> 12:16.750
Wait, wait, wait.

12:16.834 --> 12:18.041
Should we do this?

12:18.125 --> 12:19.458
I mean, they are older people.

12:19.542 --> 12:21.250
This may be their last chance
at happiness.

12:22.458 --> 12:24.834
You mean your new mom's last chance
at happiness?

12:26.250 --> 12:27.792
Yeah, they're going down.

13:31.667 --> 13:32.667
What happened?

13:33.166 --> 13:34.792
Honey, I shrunk the turkey.

13:36.625 --> 13:39.458
Oh, no. You must have flash roasted it.

13:40.083 --> 13:42.000
Flash roasted? What's that?

13:42.083 --> 13:44.125
Well, it's complicated.

13:44.458 --> 13:47.875
It's what happens when you simultaneously
over-broast and under-roast.

13:47.959 --> 13:48.959
Put simply,

13:49.041 --> 13:50.125
it shrinks everything.

13:50.208 --> 13:52.458
- Even the bones?
- Especially the bones.

13:54.542 --> 13:55.792
PJ, what are we gonna do?

13:56.333 --> 13:59.000
Well, I'm just thinking on my feet here,
but we do have a deep fryer.

13:59.083 --> 14:00.000
Yeah, so?

14:00.083 --> 14:03.166
So, if we deep fry a turkey,
dinner could be ready in 90 minutes.

14:03.458 --> 14:05.667
Okay, where are we gonna get
another bird on Thanksgiving?

14:05.917 --> 14:07.375
I have a spare turkey in the garage.

14:07.792 --> 14:09.375
Why do you have a spare turkey
in the garage?

14:10.834 --> 14:12.709
Why don't you have a spare turkey
in the garage?

14:15.500 --> 14:16.583
- Go get it.
- Okay.

14:18.625 --> 14:20.208
Hey, mom, are we gonna eat soon?

14:20.291 --> 14:21.709
'Cause everyone's really hungry

14:21.792 --> 14:23.625
and would love to be done by 4:00.

14:24.875 --> 14:27.166
Actually, uh, dinner has been delayed.

14:28.250 --> 14:31.792
PJ flash roasted the turkey
and now we have to start all over.

14:36.875 --> 14:38.166
Ivy, hi, it's me.

14:38.750 --> 14:42.083
Listen, my mom ruined the turkey
and blamed it on my brother, so...

14:43.083 --> 14:44.166
I'm gonna be late.

14:44.250 --> 14:45.792
Yeah, no, okay. Don't worry, though.

14:45.875 --> 14:48.709
I'll think of something.
Just, you... you stay in line.

14:48.959 --> 14:50.208
I'll be there as soon as I can.

14:50.792 --> 14:51.750
Okay.

14:52.166 --> 14:54.000
Mom, oh! Mom, I...

14:54.417 --> 14:55.750
have a headache.

14:55.875 --> 14:57.166
Wow. So maybe I should...

14:58.333 --> 14:59.709
rest in my room for a bit.

14:59.792 --> 15:02.917
So, if you don't see me for, like,
two hours or so, just remember,

15:03.000 --> 15:04.166
I'm in my room.

15:04.583 --> 15:06.458
Well, honey, you're probably hungry.

15:07.291 --> 15:09.250
Here, nibble on the flash turkey.

15:11.417 --> 15:12.834
Yeah, I'll be in my room.

15:16.667 --> 15:18.834
If I boil you, will you plump back up?

15:20.125 --> 15:21.375
Who are you talking to?

15:21.625 --> 15:22.792
The mini turkey.

15:32.834 --> 15:35.625
Oh, Estelle. You make me feel
like a new man.

15:36.041 --> 15:37.792
- Woof!
- Meow.

15:39.291 --> 15:41.792
Hey, you know what?
I got a really fun game called

15:41.875 --> 15:43.709
"Let's Not Make Animal Sounds."

15:46.583 --> 15:48.250
So, Mrs. Dabney...

15:48.500 --> 15:50.542
Oh, Gabe, baby, why so formal?

15:51.250 --> 15:52.125
Call me Nana.

15:52.208 --> 15:54.041
Or better yet, Gam-gam.

15:56.500 --> 15:57.375
So,

15:58.834 --> 15:59.917
Gam-gam...

16:01.166 --> 16:02.834
It's interesting that you meowed,

16:02.917 --> 16:05.417
because we know how much
you love your cat caboodle.

16:05.792 --> 16:08.667
And dad doesn't like cats at all.
Isn't that right, dad?

16:08.750 --> 16:09.667
Hate 'em.

16:10.458 --> 16:11.709
Then caboodle's gone.

16:14.250 --> 16:16.959
But you love that cat more than anything.

16:18.125 --> 16:20.166
- I thought I did.
- Oh.

16:22.959 --> 16:23.917
Hey, uh...

16:24.000 --> 16:28.458
did you know my dad snores so loud,
he rattles the whole house?

16:28.750 --> 16:29.625
Good.

16:29.709 --> 16:32.208
Mr. Dabney was one of those
silent sleepers.

16:32.583 --> 16:34.208
At least with a snorer,

16:34.291 --> 16:36.709
you know there's a man in the house.

16:37.917 --> 16:40.875
And I hope he's there for a long time.

16:40.959 --> 16:42.583
Me too.

16:42.834 --> 16:44.583
- Woof.
- Meow.

16:54.750 --> 16:55.959
Hey, how we doing out here?

16:56.625 --> 16:57.959
Everyone's really hungry.

16:58.208 --> 17:00.417
Dinner should be ready in 90 minutes.

17:01.208 --> 17:02.542
You think you could speed it up?

17:02.625 --> 17:05.750
Grandpa Frank keeps tracing finger hearts
on Mrs. Dabney's back.

17:06.709 --> 17:08.417
I guess I could whip up
some little sandwiches.

17:08.500 --> 17:10.583
- Watch the bird, okay?
- Yeah, sure.

17:13.041 --> 17:15.333
I'm gonna watch it cook twice as fast.

17:26.250 --> 17:27.333
Uh, Charlie...

17:28.583 --> 17:29.834
are you gonna eat your sandwich?

17:29.917 --> 17:30.917
Yes.

17:32.125 --> 17:33.417
Well, can I have just a bite?

17:33.917 --> 17:35.125
No, daddy.

17:36.458 --> 17:37.750
I'll buy you a doll.

17:38.542 --> 17:41.417
Okay, everyone, dinner will be
ready in 10 minutes.

17:41.583 --> 17:44.125
No, it won't. The turkey's gotta cook
for another hour.

17:44.208 --> 17:46.458
That's where you're wrong.
I turned up the heat.

17:46.542 --> 17:47.583
You did what?

17:47.667 --> 17:49.458
Turned up the heat.
Cut the cooking time in half.

17:49.542 --> 17:51.917
You can't do that. If the oil gets
too hot, then the turkey might--

17:53.750 --> 17:55.000
Explode.

17:58.291 --> 18:01.208
Oh, look at that turkey go!

18:01.667 --> 18:02.917
Oh no, it's coming back down.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.333
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- No, no, no!

18:06.208 --> 18:07.959
Okay, Ivy, I'm on my way.

18:08.041 --> 18:09.083
Yeah, see ya.

18:20.333 --> 18:21.792
How you feeling, sweetie?

18:23.250 --> 18:24.583
What happened to me again?

18:24.667 --> 18:26.375
Turkey fell out of the sky on you.

18:28.917 --> 18:30.166
But turkeys can't fly.

18:31.250 --> 18:32.208
Can they?

18:33.875 --> 18:35.625
No, I guess in cartoons they can.

18:38.083 --> 18:39.709
Oh, I like cartoons.

18:43.875 --> 18:45.166
Okay, everybody.

18:47.041 --> 18:48.959
Fresh from the vending machine.

18:49.208 --> 18:51.667
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Well, at least they're turkey.

18:52.041 --> 18:53.000
Or...

18:53.125 --> 18:54.542
"may contain turkey."

18:56.625 --> 18:57.667
Hey, honey,

18:57.834 --> 19:00.667
I'm sorry you gotta eat turkey sandwiches
in the hospital again.

19:00.750 --> 19:02.875
I know this isn't
the Thanksgiving you wanted.

19:02.959 --> 19:04.542
Well, it's not.

19:05.709 --> 19:07.542
But you know what? We're all together,

19:07.792 --> 19:09.291
Teddy's okay,

19:09.375 --> 19:11.458
and that is what I'm thankful for

19:11.875 --> 19:13.667
Yeah. Hey, you know what?

19:13.750 --> 19:16.083
I am thankful for everybody in this room.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.917
- Me too.
- Me too.

19:21.166 --> 19:24.083
I'm thankful that the patient
in room 212 ordered ice cream.

19:32.375 --> 19:33.959
I wonder how the lovebirds are doing.

19:34.041 --> 19:35.625
Frank: You can't talk to me that way.

19:35.709 --> 19:38.041
Mrs. Dabney: I can talk to you
any way I want, dimwit.

19:38.834 --> 19:39.875
That sounds promising.

19:42.125 --> 19:43.000
Hey!

19:43.250 --> 19:44.333
what's going on?

19:44.417 --> 19:45.917
He's an idiot.

19:46.208 --> 19:48.041
She's a battle ax.

19:50.458 --> 19:51.959
Yeah, we knew that, but what happened?

19:53.000 --> 19:55.333
We spent an hour alone together.

19:55.417 --> 19:57.041
Longest hour of my life.

19:57.125 --> 19:58.917
So you two aren't a couple anymore?

19:59.000 --> 20:00.542
No, we are not.

20:02.500 --> 20:05.041
And to think, I was gonna move
to Arizona with you.

20:05.417 --> 20:06.500
Say what now?

20:08.250 --> 20:09.709
Wait, wait.

20:10.375 --> 20:13.000
There's still time.
You guys can work this out.

20:13.083 --> 20:15.000
I mean, you're perfect for each other.

20:15.083 --> 20:17.417
- Oh!
- Wait, wait, come back!

20:17.959 --> 20:19.000
Gam-gam!

20:24.625 --> 20:27.041
Well, Charlie,
another Duncan family Thanksgiving

20:27.125 --> 20:28.208
has come and gone.

20:28.417 --> 20:31.166
The good news is Grandpa Duncan
has also come and gone.

20:31.417 --> 20:33.625
Hey, Teddy, tell me
what you think about this.

20:34.542 --> 20:36.000
"Dear Mrs. Dabney,

20:36.291 --> 20:39.333
I'm sorry for our ugly words.
Please forgive me.

20:39.417 --> 20:42.166
Sell your house and move
to Phoenix immediately.

20:42.250 --> 20:44.542
Do not call first. Just surprise me.

20:46.417 --> 20:48.458
Forever yours, Grandpa."

20:50.041 --> 20:52.333
Teddy: I think he would sign it "Frank."

20:53.166 --> 20:54.125
Oh...

20:54.250 --> 20:55.792
Oh, yeah, that's good. I could use that.

20:58.250 --> 21:00.375
Anyway, since we never got
a Thanksgiving dinner,

21:00.458 --> 21:02.792
PJ Is about to deep fry another turkey.

21:03.250 --> 21:04.166
So...

21:04.250 --> 21:05.583
just to be on the safe side.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.250
Wish me good luck, Charlie.

21:16.500 --> 21:17.667
Oh!

21:18.583 --> 21:21.917
That was the worst
shopping experience of my life.

21:22.750 --> 21:23.709
Mine too.

21:24.208 --> 21:27.959
I mean, I heard those sales were brutal,
but I didn't know they were this bad.

21:28.041 --> 21:29.625
And we were so close

21:29.709 --> 21:31.417
to getting that last MyTab.

21:31.750 --> 21:34.083
And then that monster came in

21:34.166 --> 21:36.375
and started throwing us
around like ragdolls.

21:39.375 --> 21:41.458
What just happened in there?

21:42.542 --> 21:44.041
Karl, are you crying?

21:44.125 --> 21:46.583
Somebody stepped on my neck.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.208
Hey, is it really worth
treating people like this

21:52.250 --> 21:54.375
to get a stupid MyTab?

21:54.458 --> 21:55.333
Yes.
