in, guys. All right, come on.

my parents will die.

Got to admit, you were right
about ganking that girl first.

One day, you'll learn. Never

[Baaz] Um, guys, I hate to
burst your well-deserved bubble,

00:54.982 --> 00:57.192
but, statistically, we barely won.

00:58.861 --> 01:00.403
[Yael] We were down to our last hit points.

01:00.488 --> 01:02.823
- Any one of us could have died.
- So? We didn't.

01:02.906 --> 01:05.576
Yeah, but... have you seen
the other teams in Regionals?

01:05.659 --> 01:06.910
Newman High are beasts.

01:06.994 --> 01:09.788
- We can take those guys.
- [Baaz] On these laggy machines?

01:09.872 --> 01:11.665
I thought mine was gonna freeze entirely.

01:11.749 --> 01:14.877
And I heard Northern's playing
on Digital Storm GTX 980s.

01:14.960 --> 01:16.294
So we give up?

01:16.378 --> 01:18.338
We are this close to
hanging a banner in the gym

01:18.421 --> 01:20.508

01:22.050 --> 01:23.511
Thanks for coming.

01:24.219 --> 01:25.804
[Baaz] Okay, but on these CPUs,

01:25.888 --> 01:27.848
in a game of millimeters, we're miles away.

01:27.931 --> 01:30.934
No, I refuse to accept
defeat before battle.

01:31.935 --> 01:33.353
I'll get us new computers.

05:01.394 --> 05:02.771
That's very generous of you, sir,

05:02.855 --> 05:04.732
but in order for our gaming
team to be competitive,

10:13.831 --> 10:15.583
In roughly four days by my count.

10:15.667 --> 10:17.044
We need to get back to work, um...

10:17.127 --> 10:19.129
We need to research the new gear...

10:21.256 --> 10:22.257
Can we help you?

10:22.340 --> 10:24.759
Have you heard what people
are saying about you guys?

10:24.842 --> 10:27.554
For the last time, if people are
making fun of us, we don't care.

10:27.637 --> 10:28.971
Yeah, they're not making fun.

10:29.056 --> 10:32.267
They're saying your video
and your club is misogynist

10:32.350 --> 10:34.477
and that it celebrates sexualized violence.

10:34.561 --> 10:38.523
Anyways, there's an emergency meeting
in student council after school.

10:39.816 --> 10:41.484
This is the stupidest
thing I've ever heard.

10:42.069 --> 10:43.611
Don't shoot the messenger. [scoffs]

10:43.695 --> 10:45.447
Then who do I shoot?

10:48.033 --> 10:49.659
[faint hammering]

10:52.745 --> 10:54.164
There's his trailer.

10:59.211 --> 11:00.962
[faint indistinct chatter]

11:05.050 --> 11:06.259
[sighs]

11:12.765 --> 11:14.142
So, what's the plan?

11:15.227 --> 11:17.520
I... didn't think we'd get this far.

11:17.604 --> 11:18.730
What if he comes back?

11:18.813 --> 11:19.939
You're right. We should go.

11:20.022 --> 11:21.899
Whoa. We should find some hair.

11:21.983 --> 11:24.236
We can do a DNA test or whatever.

11:24.319 --> 11:25.820
- What if it's not a match?
- Then you'll know.

11:25.903 --> 11:28.240
And what if it is a match, but he
just doesn't want me or never did?

11:28.323 --> 11:31.284
[scoffs] Then you'll know. Why are
you freaking out all of a sudden?

11:31.368 --> 11:32.452
I'm not ready for this.

11:32.535 --> 11:35.122
Would you really rather live
a lie than know the truth?

11:36.581 --> 11:39.459
[sighs] Okay, let's find some hair and go.

11:42.337 --> 11:43.713
- Coat.
- Check the collar.

11:44.756 --> 11:45.798
[Grace chuckles]

11:47.884 --> 11:48.926
Underwear.

11:49.469 --> 11:51.346
- Large.
- Gross.

11:51.429 --> 11:53.931
That's my dad's... maybe.

11:54.015 --> 11:55.517
[door knob rattles]

12:00.605 --> 12:01.648
What the hell's going on here?

12:01.731 --> 12:03.316
Nothing. We can explain.

12:04.776 --> 12:05.985
All right, I'm calling security.

12:06.068 --> 12:07.862
You two, sit down and stay put.

12:09.781 --> 12:10.823
Sit down!

12:10.907 --> 12:12.909
- [gavel pounding]
- [Tristan] <i>Sit down!</i>

12:12.992 --> 12:14.161
<i>Sit down!</i>

12:14.952 --> 12:16.579
One at a time.

12:16.663 --> 12:18.415
We're here to discuss
the future of Gamer Club,

12:18.498 --> 12:20.333
not snipe at each other.

12:20.417 --> 12:23.503
Maya, the Feminist Club
still has the floor.

12:23.586 --> 12:24.629
As I was saying,

12:24.712 --> 12:26.589
when Hunter and his
friends play their games,

12:26.673 --> 12:28.383
they say a lot of really sexist stuff.

12:28.466 --> 12:29.467
So you've been spying on us?

12:29.551 --> 12:31.010
- [scoffs]
- You play in the gym.

12:31.093 --> 12:32.720
We wouldn't say anything
offensive in there.

12:33.388 --> 12:34.556
[Maya] "Hike up your skirt"?

12:34.639 --> 12:36.933
Referring to the victims only as "ladies"?

12:37.016 --> 12:40.603
- Fine, we'll stop. Can I go?
- [Goldi] That's not all.

12:40.687 --> 12:42.897
Your game also hypersexualizes women.

12:44.899 --> 12:47.652
And the men are shown as powerful...

12:47.735 --> 12:49.946
- and notably clothed.
- [Hunter scoffs]

12:50.029 --> 12:51.406
Those aren't even humans.

12:51.489 --> 12:54.284
Those are, like, animals and
plants, and robots and stuff.

12:54.367 --> 12:55.952
Yeah, with tons of cleave.

12:56.035 --> 12:57.704
And how is that any different
from a cheerleading uniform?

12:57.787 --> 12:59.163
[Goldi] They're regularly attacked.

12:59.247 --> 13:02.625
It's potentially harmful to any
woman who's experienced violence.

13:09.048 --> 13:10.925
You do know we have a football team, right?

13:11.008 --> 13:13.135
And those guys are actually
trying to hurt each other.

13:13.220 --> 13:16.138
Your game normalizes male
violence against women.

13:16.223 --> 13:19.016
Imagine how that feels to
a sexual assault survivor.

13:19.100 --> 13:21.436
- Well, they don't have to watch.
- But it's in their halls.

13:21.519 --> 13:25.607
The school can't continue to sanction
this potentially triggering activity.

13:25.690 --> 13:27.317
[scoffs] "Triggering"?

13:27.400 --> 13:30.862
Then let's ban everything that
triggers anyone's fear, right? Like...

13:30.945 --> 13:34.241
like blonde hair, which triggers
my fear of populars mocking me

13:34.324 --> 13:36.493
for whatever fashion faux pas I've made.

13:36.576 --> 13:39.287
Or, like, your meathead
boy toy, who I am afraid

13:39.371 --> 13:42.039
will punch me if I make
eye contact with him in gym.

13:42.123 --> 13:44.125
- Or like your headgear...
- [girl gasps]

13:44.208 --> 13:46.544
triggering my fear that
you'll snap and blow us all up.

13:46.628 --> 13:49.088
Okay, everything is a
trigger! Everyone's scared!

13:49.171 --> 13:50.673
That's high school!

13:58.306 --> 14:00.141
This whole thing is stupid.

14:05.480 --> 14:07.524
[David] No, I'm telling
you, they were just in here.

14:07.607 --> 14:09.233
Yeah, I can wait.

14:10.234 --> 14:12.111
This is all a misunderstanding.

14:12.194 --> 14:13.988
<i>Gilmore Girls</i> goes up on Netflix,

14:14.071 --> 14:16.783
and it's like a whole new
generation of you stalker fangirls.

14:16.866 --> 14:18.701
[scoffs] I don't even know who you are.

14:18.785 --> 14:19.911
You're holding my underwear.

14:19.994 --> 14:21.078
Because I'm your daughter.

14:22.372 --> 14:24.416
- What?
- My mom was an extra on the show

14:24.499 --> 14:26.251
and she always hinted that
maybe something happened.

14:26.334 --> 14:27.460
That's ridiculous.

14:27.544 --> 14:30.338
We need the underwear to know for
sure, unless you'll give us blood?

14:30.422 --> 14:31.839
No one's getting my blood. Look...

14:31.923 --> 14:34.801
I'm sorry, but I'm not
your dad. There's no way.

14:34.884 --> 14:39.264
I don't mix business with pleasure, and
I was never into sleeping with extras.

14:40.432 --> 14:42.767
I'm really sorry we bothered you.

14:44.602 --> 14:46.979
Whatever. Forget it. Just... just go.

14:47.063 --> 14:48.440
Gladly.

14:52.444 --> 14:53.528
Are you gonna be okay?

14:54.612 --> 14:56.489
I... don't know.

14:57.407 --> 14:59.326
My mom doesn't want me
to be like this, so...

14:59.409 --> 15:02.912
- A girl who breaks into trailers?
- A girl who likes girls.

15:03.913 --> 15:05.873
Sorry, not your problem.

15:07.083 --> 15:09.294
I just thought that if
you were my dad, I could...

15:09.377 --> 15:11.421
come live with you and
everything would be okay.

15:12.755 --> 15:13.798
It will be.

15:14.716 --> 15:16.884
So... I can come live with you?

15:16.968 --> 15:18.595
No.

15:18.678 --> 15:20.930
But you should stop
caring what your mom says.

15:21.013 --> 15:24.684
- You can't live a lie for her.
- Even if the truth makes her hate me?

15:26.519 --> 15:30.022
Look, I know this is gonna sound like
fatherly advice from some teen show,

15:30.106 --> 15:32.359
but it also happens to be true.

15:32.442 --> 15:34.777
It's your life, not hers.

15:34.861 --> 15:37.405
And you can only ever make yourself happy.

15:41.451 --> 15:43.661
Hey, do you think I
could call you sometime?

15:44.161 --> 15:45.663
Absolutely not.

15:53.380 --> 15:56.841
- What in God's name is that?
- [Frankie] A praline.

15:56.924 --> 15:59.844
You're eating pralines and cream.
It's not just a clever name.

16:00.387 --> 16:03.515
- Didn't you order cookies and cream?
- I don't wanna make a fuss.

16:03.598 --> 16:04.891
[Tiny] My girl paid for cookies,

16:04.974 --> 16:06.684
- my girl's getting cookies.
- [Lola chuckles]

16:11.481 --> 16:13.274
- This is torture.
- Then let's leave.

16:13.358 --> 16:15.610
What are we doing here,
anyway? Eating sundaes?

16:15.693 --> 16:18.112
[scoffs] This is childish. I
should already be volunteering.

16:18.195 --> 16:20.740
But if we go, they'll know I have
a problem with their relationship.

16:20.823 --> 16:22.074
You do have a problem
with their relationship.

16:22.158 --> 16:24.452
Okay, I don't want Lo to know that.

16:25.370 --> 16:27.539
No, you know what? You
chose not to go out with him.

16:27.622 --> 16:29.206
You're not allowed to be upset about it.

16:29.290 --> 16:30.833
Says the girl who's chosen to be upset

16:30.917 --> 16:32.877
about Winston for the past month.

16:33.586 --> 16:35.296
We were there for you.

16:35.380 --> 16:37.424
Changed my mind and got SuperKid.

16:37.507 --> 16:38.925
Look, rainbows.

16:41.302 --> 16:42.429
[chuckles softly]

16:42.512 --> 16:45.014
[huffing angrily]

16:51.187 --> 16:53.481
- What are you doing?
- [breathing heavily]

16:53.565 --> 16:54.774
They shut us down.

16:54.857 --> 16:57.068
We aren't fit to represent
the school, so who cares?

16:57.151 --> 16:58.445
We don't need this junk.

16:58.528 --> 17:00.321
[scoffing] That's it then?
You're just giving up?

17:00.405 --> 17:02.449
They're allowed to say whatever
they want to say about us,

17:02.532 --> 17:04.951
but as soon as I say anything
back, I'm the monster.

17:05.034 --> 17:06.117
Well, they're idiots!

17:06.202 --> 17:08.037
[panting]

17:08.119 --> 17:09.497
You don't hate me?

17:11.583 --> 17:15.752
I heard what you said. That
was... dumb stuff, sure.

17:15.837 --> 17:19.256
But I know you're not racist... or sexist.

17:19.339 --> 17:21.675
I mean, you're my best friend.

17:24.011 --> 17:26.347
All I wanted to do was win
the championship with you guys.

17:26.431 --> 17:29.266
Then stop smashing things,
and find a way to fix this.

17:31.018 --> 17:32.269
[Yael sighs]

17:36.273 --> 17:37.734
[exhales deeply]

17:42.321 --> 17:44.365
So, what are we playing?

17:44.449 --> 17:46.451
"Were" playing.

17:46.534 --> 17:48.160
Don't tell me I missed it.

17:48.244 --> 17:50.830
Okay, how about I tell
you that you ruined it?

17:51.456 --> 17:53.082
Whoa, I'm just a little late.

17:54.501 --> 17:55.668
Two full hours.

17:56.628 --> 17:57.795
And you failed to bring the tennis balls,

17:57.879 --> 17:59.380
so we had to switch
games at the last minute

17:59.464 --> 18:00.548
and play capture the flag...

18:00.632 --> 18:02.759
for the billionth time.

18:02.842 --> 18:05.261
I'm sorry. I had to do something first.

18:06.596 --> 18:09.056
You're not on FaceRange. I didn't
know how to get a hold of you.

18:09.140 --> 18:10.808
Frankie...

18:10.892 --> 18:14.270
these kids need somebody
who's not gonna let them down.

18:14.353 --> 18:16.731
And you're late because... Let me guess.

18:16.814 --> 18:20.401
You had a fashion emergency? Bestie drama?

18:22.278 --> 18:25.156
I wanted to be here. Not
with my stupid friends.

18:25.239 --> 18:27.158
And yet, you weren't.

18:27.241 --> 18:29.243
[scoffs] I can do better.

18:30.870 --> 18:32.246
I doubt it.

18:32.329 --> 18:35.207
I think you're just addicted
to the drama of being miserable.

18:38.127 --> 18:40.588
And you know, everybody who comes here...

18:40.672 --> 18:42.632
they are actually trying to change.

18:43.550 --> 18:44.759
Everybody but you.

18:46.511 --> 18:48.220
[Frankie sighs]

18:51.473 --> 18:52.600
[sighs]

18:55.394 --> 18:58.147
On the bright side, you've ruled him out.

18:58.230 --> 19:00.567
One down, three-and-a-half billion to go.

19:00.650 --> 19:04.278
- You think this is a joke?
- I'm trying to cheer you up.

19:04.361 --> 19:07.031
I have no one. No dad, an awful mother.

19:07.114 --> 19:08.908
[sighs] Your mom's not that bad.

19:10.785 --> 19:12.244
[sighs]

19:12.328 --> 19:13.788
She said I can't hang out with you.

19:16.373 --> 19:18.876
[scoffs] I'm all alone in this world.

19:18.960 --> 19:20.628
[scoffs] No, you're not.

19:20.712 --> 19:22.463
Oh, really? Who do I have?

19:22.547 --> 19:23.881
Me, dummy. [giggles]

19:23.965 --> 19:26.718
The girl who just broke into
a TV star's trailer for you.

19:27.468 --> 19:29.095
[chuckles]

19:31.000 --> 19:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

19:49.240 --> 19:51.533
[groans softly]

19:53.911 --> 19:56.766
Oh, I'm sorry. I should go.

19:56.867 --> 19:59.626
Uh, Winston... why are you even here?

19:59.709 --> 20:01.961
Well, I was crazy enough to think that

20:02.044 --> 20:04.881
Miles was actually going to meet
me to finish our history project.

20:04.964 --> 20:07.174
That guy never comes home anymore.

20:07.258 --> 20:08.300
I think he's on drugs.

20:08.384 --> 20:11.053
[chuckles] I think he's
on an entire pharmacy.

20:14.223 --> 20:16.350
- What's wrong, Franks?
- This isn't your job anymore.

20:16.433 --> 20:17.935
I know, but...

20:18.019 --> 20:20.938
you're sad... and I'm here.

20:24.233 --> 20:25.567
I just... I don't... [sighs]

20:25.652 --> 20:27.779
I don't know who to be.

20:27.862 --> 20:31.824
My friends don't want me to change,
but I don't feel the same, you know?

20:32.992 --> 20:34.911
Everything was simpler last year.

20:36.037 --> 20:37.705
It was so much easier to...

20:38.956 --> 20:40.249
be happy.

20:42.794 --> 20:44.503
I just wish we could go back.

20:47.840 --> 20:49.676
I wish we could, too.

21:00.978 --> 21:02.563
[Tristan] Both Simpson
and the PTA approached me.

21:02.647 --> 21:04.774
[Goldi] That's what I was
thinking about the whole thing.

21:04.857 --> 21:05.900
I didn't want it to be a thing.

21:05.983 --> 21:07.860
- [Tristan] No, of course.
- Yeah.

21:07.944 --> 21:09.153
Please, don't shut us down

21:09.236 --> 21:10.655
just because I said some
things the wrong way.

21:10.738 --> 21:14.241
And what, pray tell, was the right
way to stereotype my entire religion?

21:14.325 --> 21:16.911
I was trying to make a
point about irrational fear.

21:16.994 --> 21:19.205
I think it's dumb that people think that.

21:20.622 --> 21:22.416
Okay, I've got solutions, all right?

21:22.499 --> 21:24.376
We'll ditch the headsets.
No more trash talk.

21:24.460 --> 21:26.754
And we just won't use the
female characters at all.

21:26.838 --> 21:28.630
So there's gonna be no
female representation?

21:28.715 --> 21:31.843
- What? There's a girl on the team.
- [Tristan] Just one.

21:31.926 --> 21:34.053
And on the other teams,
I've seen pretty much none.

21:34.136 --> 21:36.388
It's not my fault that guys are
better than girls at video games.

21:36.472 --> 21:39.058
- Oh, wow.
- Okay, that's not what I'm...

21:39.141 --> 21:40.226
[sighs]

21:40.309 --> 21:42.729
Guys grow up playing video
games, okay? I don't know why.

21:42.812 --> 21:45.106
But by now, they're better at
it. It's just reality, okay?

21:45.189 --> 21:46.190
I'm trying.

21:46.273 --> 21:48.901
- How about you try a different video game?
- No!

21:48.985 --> 21:51.487
I thought we were talking
solutions. What about Wii bowling?

21:51.570 --> 21:52.864
Oh, my God.

21:52.947 --> 21:55.282
You don't get it, do you? This is the game.

21:55.366 --> 21:56.826
Like at Nationals, like in the pros.

21:56.909 --> 21:58.660
- I didn't design it. I just play it.
- Okay,

21:58.745 --> 22:01.372
the PTA already heard about
the meeting, and Simpson, too,

22:01.455 --> 22:03.374
and they've asked for
the club to be shut down.

22:03.457 --> 22:07.169
That's bull! When you were elected,
you said you'd fight for us.

22:08.004 --> 22:11.799
Well, I have to pick my battles, and
you made this one too hard to win.

22:14.551 --> 22:15.677
[scoffs]

22:18.264 --> 22:19.515
[bell ringing]

22:21.142 --> 22:22.184
I just need to grab my...

22:22.268 --> 22:24.686
- We all heard that.
- Yeah?

22:24.771 --> 22:27.064
Well, I failed again, so...

22:27.148 --> 22:30.401
But you fought for us.
No one ever fights for us.

22:30.484 --> 22:32.403
And now it's clear those
social justice warriors

22:32.486 --> 22:33.821
don't even know what they're talking about.

22:33.905 --> 22:34.989
So you guys aren't mad?

22:35.072 --> 22:37.283
Regionals may be kaput, but...

22:37.366 --> 22:39.576
we'll still follow you into any battle.

22:40.619 --> 22:42.038
Any battle?

22:44.040 --> 22:45.374
Because I think I might know our next one.

22:45.457 --> 22:47.001
[Yael] Really? What?

22:49.711 --> 22:51.005
Revenge.

22:51.088 --> 22:53.007
