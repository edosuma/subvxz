discouraged, so I fixed it.

Fish eye soup again?

12:28.684 --> 12:30.017
Fish eye soup again.

12:30.051 --> 12:31.984
Soup is good food.

12:34.417 --> 12:36.984
Now, I want you
to eat it while it's hot.

12:37.017 --> 12:39.417
If you let it get cold,
the eyes will get tough.

12:41.351 --> 12:43.284
[instrumental music]

12:51.784 --> 12:53.584
Hello. Pioli's Pizza?

12:53.617 --> 12:55.817
This is Larry Appleton.

12:55.851 --> 12:56.817
Yes, it's me again.

12:58.084 --> 12:59.417
I want that pizza now!

13:01.317 --> 13:02.751
Because there is a man here

13:02.784 --> 13:04.784
who has not had
real food for five days

13:04.817 --> 13:07.017
and he is very, very hungry!

13:07.051 --> 13:08.384
[knock on door]

13:08.417 --> 13:10.817
It's here. Uh, uh...
You have a nice day now.

13:15.051 --> 13:17.484
Balki!

13:17.517 --> 13:19.384
I thought you were out
collecting clothes for the poor.

13:19.417 --> 13:20.551
Well, cousin, I was.

13:20.584 --> 13:21.884
Look how generous people were.

13:21.917 --> 13:23.884
They give the pants
off their backs.

13:24.751 --> 13:26.351
Balki, that's not enough.

13:26.384 --> 13:27.451
Winter is coming.

13:27.484 --> 13:29.417
Go back out there
and get wool!

13:30.651 --> 13:31.784
What am I saying?

13:31.817 --> 13:33.751
Wool is itchy.

13:34.884 --> 13:37.451
‐ Who that man?
‐ Census taker.

13:37.484 --> 13:38.584
Two.

13:41.651 --> 13:42.651
You know,
I tell you what..

13:42.684 --> 13:44.917
I've lost quite a few inches
around the old middle.

13:44.951 --> 13:48.451
A lot of my clothes just
are way too big for me.

13:48.484 --> 13:50.684
Why don't you back,
go through my closet

13:50.717 --> 13:54.284
and take whatever you like?

13:55.884 --> 13:57.451
But, cousin, you know

13:57.484 --> 13:58.784
you were already
so generous this morning‐‐

13:58.817 --> 14:00.851
Well, I'm, I'm being
generous again!

14:04.651 --> 14:06.817
Sorry, I wanted it
to be a surprise.

14:06.851 --> 14:08.917
It's his birthday.
You keep the change now.

14:10.884 --> 14:12.851
Cousin, you know...

14:14.784 --> 14:16.417
...this shirt,
I think, still fits you.

14:16.451 --> 14:17.851
Oh, doesn't matter.
Did you get the sweaters?

14:17.884 --> 14:20.017
‐ What sweaters?
‐ All my cashmere sweaters!

14:20.051 --> 14:22.551
Take them! Take them!

14:53.751 --> 14:55.484
You should be

14:55.517 --> 14:57.684
ashamed of yourself.

15:02.417 --> 15:03.884
Well, you‐you know...

15:03.917 --> 15:05.917
...ordinarily, I would be
ashamed of myself, but, uh...

15:05.951 --> 15:08.384
Oh, hey, I decided I don't need

15:08.417 --> 15:09.751
to lose all that weight anyway.

15:09.784 --> 15:11.884
I'm perfectly happy
the way I am.

15:11.917 --> 15:13.851
I'll go get the pizza.

15:18.617 --> 15:21.317
Oh. Oh, I know.

15:21.351 --> 15:22.884
It's the promise thing, right?

15:22.917 --> 15:24.884
Balki, you can forget
about your promise.

15:24.917 --> 15:27.784
Uh, we can go on
with our lives.

15:27.817 --> 15:29.784
I'll go get the pizza.

15:33.951 --> 15:36.551
Balki, Balki, Balki.

15:37.517 --> 15:38.884
This isn't Mypos.

15:38.917 --> 15:40.484
It's America.

15:40.517 --> 15:43.017
People break promises
all the time.

15:43.051 --> 15:45.051
That's why we all
that Indian land.

15:48.917 --> 15:50.851
I'll go get the pizza.

15:53.317 --> 15:54.851
Okay, okay, forget
about the pizza.

15:54.884 --> 15:56.351
You know, I,
I don't even know

15:56.384 --> 15:58.351
why we're having
this discussion.

15:58.384 --> 15:59.951
The diet is over

15:59.984 --> 16:01.817
and that's that.

16:01.851 --> 16:03.884
Ha ha!

16:03.917 --> 16:05.617
I mean, it‐it‐it's just
a few extra pounds?

16:05.651 --> 16:07.051
I can learn live with it.

16:07.084 --> 16:09.717
Hey, it may be good thing.
The world loves a fat man.

16:09.751 --> 16:11.051
Tell you what...

16:11.084 --> 16:13.517
I'm gonna go out
and grab a bite to eat.

16:18.617 --> 16:20.284
You're not going anywhere.

16:20.317 --> 16:22.551
I'll stay. I'll be good.
Just put me down.

16:23.884 --> 16:25.417
[crunch]

16:31.317 --> 16:33.317
What was that?

16:34.451 --> 16:36.384
What was what?

16:39.051 --> 16:41.484
Oh!
Goodness gracious!

16:42.584 --> 16:44.551
Those are cookies.

16:46.717 --> 16:48.984
I wonder who put them there.

16:49.017 --> 16:50.717
I bet it wasn't
the Cookie Monster.

16:53.584 --> 16:55.584
Balki, I don't know what
you're talking about.

16:55.617 --> 16:58.051
Those things have probably
been in the couch for years.

16:58.084 --> 16:59.784
I bought it used.

17:00.884 --> 17:02.551
Well, I just have
to look myself.

17:06.017 --> 17:07.584
Aha!

17:11.416 --> 17:13.550
‐ Is this all of it?
‐ Yes, yes.

17:15.084 --> 17:17.817
You know, I can always
tell when you're lying

17:17.851 --> 17:19.983
because you say
everything twice.

17:22.416 --> 17:23.416
I'm not lying.

17:23.451 --> 17:25.483
I am not lying.

17:35.351 --> 17:37.884
Well, then, I will
find the things myself.

17:39.051 --> 17:41.817
And I'll use
your conscience as my guide.

17:43.684 --> 17:46.651
[intense music]

18:25.051 --> 18:26.517
Unh!

18:30.551 --> 18:32.417
You should be

18:32.451 --> 18:34.817
ashamed of yourself.

18:34.851 --> 18:35.951
I am.

18:35.984 --> 18:37.717
I am ashamed.

18:37.751 --> 18:40.351
I wanna thank you
for saving me from myself.

18:41.051 --> 18:42.517
Thank you.

18:47.317 --> 18:49.284
Thank you.
You're a real friend.

18:58.684 --> 19:00.684
[sniffing]
Ah! Ah!

19:02.684 --> 19:04.684
Ah! Ah!

19:16.351 --> 19:17.751
Give me that.

19:20.017 --> 19:22.251
I'm eating this,
and you can't stop me.

19:22.951 --> 19:23.917
No!

19:23.951 --> 19:24.917
[grunting]

19:32.017 --> 19:33.517
Stay back!

19:33.551 --> 19:35.484
I'm not afraid to use this!

19:39.451 --> 19:40.684
Alright.

19:40.717 --> 19:41.751
Go ahead.

19:41.784 --> 19:43.717
Eat your stupid donut.

19:46.351 --> 19:48.984
‐ What?
‐ Go ahead and eat it.

19:49.017 --> 19:50.917
If it's that important
to you, go ahead.

19:50.951 --> 19:51.751
I don't care.

19:51.784 --> 19:54.684
I wash my feet
off the whole business.

19:57.551 --> 19:58.717
You‐you‐you're not
gonna stop me?

19:58.751 --> 20:00.284
No.

20:00.317 --> 20:02.551
But you're supposed
to stop me. You promised.

20:02.584 --> 20:04.317
Well, I break my promise.

20:04.351 --> 20:06.617
Balki, you said a Mypiot
never breaks his promise.

20:06.651 --> 20:08.884
Well, a Mypiot
never lived with you.

20:10.717 --> 20:12.817
On Mypios, when you ask
somebody to help you

20:12.851 --> 20:15.551
you let them help you.
You don't fight them.

20:15.584 --> 20:17.917
You are the one
that want to lose weight

20:17.951 --> 20:19.851
and you make me do all the work.

20:19.884 --> 20:22.351
You lie to me...

20:22.384 --> 20:23.651
...and you trick me

20:23.684 --> 20:25.051
and now this.

20:25.084 --> 20:27.517
You have made our living room

20:27.551 --> 20:29.517
into a 7‐Eleven.

20:34.951 --> 20:37.517
And I can't take it anymore.

20:37.551 --> 20:40.484
I haven't got time for the pain.

20:46.984 --> 20:48.484
So...

20:48.517 --> 20:50.551
I'm breaking my promise.

20:54.817 --> 20:55.951
There.
I hope you're happy.

20:55.984 --> 20:57.917
You make me the first
Mypiot in history

20:57.951 --> 20:59.417
to break a promise.

21:01.551 --> 21:03.717
[instrumental music]

21:03.751 --> 21:06.384
Balki, I'm, I'm sorry
I did this to you.

21:06.417 --> 21:07.884
I...

21:07.917 --> 21:10.584
When I asked you
for help, I‐I meant it.

21:10.617 --> 21:12.784
'Cause I never had
to lose weight before.

21:13.817 --> 21:15.784
Whenever people
said how hard it was

21:15.817 --> 21:19.484
I‐I, I never understood
why they didn't just eat less.

21:19.517 --> 21:21.917
Look, the past few days,
I've learned how hard it is.

21:23.784 --> 21:26.817
I should never have made you
take all the responsibility.

21:27.951 --> 21:28.917
Uh.
Oh!

21:30.917 --> 21:33.917
I wish there was some way
I could make it up to you.

21:34.984 --> 21:36.884
Well...

21:36.917 --> 21:38.751
...there is one way.

21:38.784 --> 21:41.351
There is?
I'll do anything.

21:41.384 --> 21:42.617
You could go back on the diet.

21:42.651 --> 21:44.717
I can't do that.

21:44.751 --> 21:48.251
Well, then I'll just have
to be a Mypiot without honor.

21:49.517 --> 21:51.751
I suppose I could
get used to wearing the hood.

21:54.784 --> 21:57.517
‐ The hood?
‐ Yes.

21:57.551 --> 22:00.384
It's, it's made from stinky

22:00.417 --> 22:01.617
itchy goat hair

22:01.651 --> 22:03.317
and it makes
your skin break out.

22:03.351 --> 22:05.451
But that don't matter so much

22:05.484 --> 22:08.017
because no one will
ever see my face again.

22:12.484 --> 22:14.417
[crying]

22:20.717 --> 22:22.717
Alright.
I'll go back on the diet.

22:22.751 --> 22:23.884
Okay.

22:25.451 --> 22:27.384
[instrumental music]

22:31.851 --> 22:32.884
Cousin, hurry up.

22:32.917 --> 22:34.317
Uh, the sooner
you weigh yourself

22:34.351 --> 22:36.351
the sooner we can
get something to eat.

22:36.384 --> 22:38.017
Larry, you look great.

22:38.051 --> 22:39.251
Yeah, have you lost weight?

22:42.317 --> 22:44.317
Mary Anne, he's been on a diet.

22:45.451 --> 22:46.451
Oh, right.

22:48.451 --> 22:51.284
Come on, cousin. We want to see
how much less there is of you.

22:54.684 --> 22:57.684
Alright, now you know
the important thing...

22:57.717 --> 23:00.951
...is not whether I've
gained or lost weight.

23:00.984 --> 23:03.617
It's that
I've grown as a person.

23:03.651 --> 23:05.684
The inner me is stronger.

23:05.717 --> 23:07.784
Well, we want to see how much
the outer you weighs.

23:07.817 --> 23:09.851
Well, my self‐esteem
does not depend

23:09.884 --> 23:11.817
on a bunch
of numbers on a scale.

23:12.717 --> 23:14.951
Yes! Yes! I did it!

23:14.984 --> 23:16.384
I've lost seven pounds.

23:16.417 --> 23:18.617
‐ Oh, cousin!
‐ Very good!

23:21.551 --> 23:23.551
Come on.
Let's go to dinner.
