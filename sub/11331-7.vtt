00:00.164 --> 00:03.164
GRACE: <i>Previously on The Secret
Life the American Teenager...</i>

00:03.711 --> 00:05.778
What the hell
is she doing here?

00:05.813 --> 00:08.548
Forget about that guy!
I can't!

00:08.582 --> 00:10.450
I should have told Amy
we were going to church.

00:10.484 --> 00:11.584
It's the first time
she's seen us together

00:11.619 --> 00:12.752
and I think I might
have upset her.

00:12.786 --> 00:15.521
Our family doesn't
exist anymore.

00:15.556 --> 00:17.590
(SIGHS) Amy...

00:17.625 --> 00:22.528
It's very important to me that whoever
you're with fits into this family.

00:22.563 --> 00:24.597
Does he still have the extra
key to the apartment?

00:24.632 --> 00:26.833
Yeah. You keep blanking
out on that video!

00:29.503 --> 00:31.537
STONE: You go see Grace
and apologize to her

00:31.572 --> 00:33.806
and tell her how you feel
and ask her to see you again

00:33.841 --> 00:36.409
and back the hell off from
pressuring her to have sex.

00:39.274 --> 00:41.614
Omar?
Mom.

00:41.649 --> 00:42.715
Mom?

00:42.750 --> 00:45.752
I could pretend
to be dating Henry.

00:45.786 --> 00:48.421
He could drop me off
and pick me up

00:48.455 --> 00:50.657
and in between,
I could be with you.

00:50.691 --> 00:52.558
Huh. That's brilliant.

00:52.593 --> 00:53.760
I'm all yours
if you'll have me.

00:55.429 --> 00:56.496
Thank you, God.

01:03.537 --> 01:05.538
That was the guy
from the school board.

01:05.572 --> 01:08.474
I know.
Tell me, tell me.

01:08.509 --> 01:12.345
Well, Ben's off the hook and there'll
be nothing on his record or Omar's.

01:12.379 --> 01:15.682
They said they understood that Ben has been
under tremendous stress in the last year

01:15.716 --> 01:18.518
and it was good he already
apologized to Omar,

01:18.552 --> 01:20.687
so the whole thing
is dismissed.

01:20.721 --> 01:22.689
They're going to have the counselor
let him know this morning.

01:22.723 --> 01:24.557
That's great!
Yay!

01:24.591 --> 01:27.627
You're on a roll! Well, all's
well that ends well, right?

01:27.661 --> 01:29.696
I guess. Long as he stays
away from that girl,

01:29.730 --> 01:31.731
maybe he'll
stay out of trouble.

01:31.765 --> 01:35.735
And hey, if Camille calls, let me
be the one that tells her, okay?

01:35.769 --> 01:39.372
I would never tell her anything
that's personal to you, ever.

01:39.406 --> 01:44.610
No, I guess not, I just wanted to be
sure that I'm the one that tells her.

01:44.845 --> 01:46.479
Okay.

01:46.780 --> 01:47.814
Okay, then.

01:47.848 --> 01:50.583
And why is that?
Why is what?

01:50.617 --> 01:53.553
Why do you want to make sure you tell her yourself.
What's up with that?

01:53.587 --> 01:56.422
I just want to make sure
she's told in the right way.

01:56.457 --> 01:57.523
About Ben.
Yeah.

01:59.860 --> 02:01.394
Oh.

02:01.428 --> 02:03.696
I get it. Mmm-hmm.

02:03.731 --> 02:09.401
In a way that makes it sound
like it was not easy.

02:09.436 --> 02:12.405
In a way that makes it look like
children are a whole lot of trouble

02:12.439 --> 02:15.375
and you just narrowly escaped
disaster once again,

02:16.477 --> 02:19.412
in a way that doesn't
encourage her

02:19.446 --> 02:21.381
to want more children,

02:21.415 --> 02:24.751
and especially in a way
that doesn't encourage her

02:24.785 --> 02:28.621
to want to marry you and be
a part of the wacky family?

02:28.655 --> 02:31.624
I'm nine months from having
him graduate high school.

02:31.658 --> 02:34.427
Freedom is just
around the corner.

02:35.596 --> 02:38.564
(CHUCKLES) Yep.

02:38.599 --> 02:42.668
So, that's it? Nothing goes on my permanent
record about causing anyone any trouble?

02:42.703 --> 02:43.703
No.

02:44.605 --> 02:46.472
And my record?

02:46.507 --> 02:48.474
You might want to ask for this
to be made part of your record.

02:48.509 --> 02:51.310
The school board was really pleased
with the way you handled the matter,

02:51.345 --> 02:53.312
especially considering
you're a student teacher

02:53.347 --> 02:54.680
and this was your
first day of school.

02:54.715 --> 02:57.483
They thought you
followed the rules and,

02:57.518 --> 02:59.619
"Conducted himself in a
professional manner at a time

02:59.653 --> 03:02.522
"when it would have been easier
to avoid filing a report."

03:02.556 --> 03:04.357
Nice.

03:04.391 --> 03:07.393
But I think I'd like to keep it
confidential and off-record anyway.

03:07.428 --> 03:09.495
Done. Read something
they said about me.

03:09.530 --> 03:11.497
Did they say anything
about me like that?

03:11.532 --> 03:15.334
About how quickly I apologized,
admitted I was in the wrong?

03:15.369 --> 03:21.240
Um, uh, I don't think so.
Let me see, um...

03:21.275 --> 03:25.445
"Understandable, considering the stress Ben
has been under during the past year and..."

03:25.479 --> 03:27.346
So forth.
What's the so forth?

03:27.381 --> 03:28.648
You want to just
leave this alone?

03:28.682 --> 03:30.450
I mean, we both
caught a break here.

03:30.484 --> 03:32.518
No, I do not just want
to leave this alone,

03:32.553 --> 03:35.455
if you don't mind. I would like
to know about the "and so forth."

03:35.489 --> 03:37.690
Oh, they just understood that
there might be some jealousy

03:37.724 --> 03:39.492
since you both had a
relationship with Adrian.

03:39.526 --> 03:42.328
Both had a relationship?
I was married to her.

03:42.362 --> 03:44.630
He wasn't married to her.
He's not married to her.

03:44.665 --> 03:47.600
I might get married to her.
I asked her to marry me.

03:47.634 --> 03:49.635
What?
Months ago.

03:49.670 --> 03:51.504
Look, I'm in love
with Adrian. All right?

03:51.538 --> 03:53.372
She doesn't want to think about
getting married right now,

03:53.407 --> 03:55.641
but I want to marry her.

03:55.676 --> 03:57.643
She met my mother
last Sunday, after church.

03:57.678 --> 04:01.280
What? All right, then,
we should disperse.

04:01.315 --> 04:02.448
Get going.

04:02.483 --> 04:04.283
(CLEARING THROAT)

04:12.626 --> 04:15.661
I can't believe this.
Amy is married and

04:15.696 --> 04:18.598
Adrian is semi-engaged
or something

04:18.632 --> 04:22.668
and I'm not even allowed to date.
This is ridiculous.

04:22.703 --> 04:25.371
Ridiculous times call
for ridiculous measures.

04:25.405 --> 04:27.440
Like?

04:27.474 --> 04:32.278
Like staying home and studying and
focusing on getting into college.

04:32.312 --> 04:35.348
Getting an education
prepares you for life.

04:35.382 --> 04:38.584
Getting an education helps you think.
Thinking is a skill in itself.

04:38.619 --> 04:40.620
Look, say what you want
about school,

04:40.654 --> 04:43.523
but life is all about
does the boy get the girl?

04:43.557 --> 04:46.259
Does the girl get the boy?
Or does the boy get the boy?

04:46.293 --> 04:48.628
Or does the girl get the girl?
Or any of that, all of that!

04:48.662 --> 04:51.764
I understand what you're saying,
but let me put it another way.

04:53.600 --> 04:55.635
Every relationship is a school.

04:55.669 --> 04:58.404
Every person you meet
is a teacher.

04:58.438 --> 05:00.573
If you don't like learning
things in school,

05:00.607 --> 05:04.343
you're probably going to have a few
problems learning from people.

05:04.378 --> 05:06.312
Now, that's ridiculous.

It's important to have

05:34.274 --> 05:36.442
Not just a boyfriend
and not just guy friends,

05:36.476 --> 05:38.344
but girlfriends.

05:38.378 --> 05:39.412
I don't like girls.

05:39.446 --> 05:44.450
They're catty and mean
and, well, I like guys.

05:44.484 --> 05:45.651
Okay, well, you probably
don't like girls

05:45.686 --> 05:48.554
because you've had
bad experiences with girls.

05:48.589 --> 05:50.489
No, I've had a bad experience
with a guy

05:50.524 --> 05:54.694
and I still like guys. I just don't like
girls on a general principle.

05:55.762 --> 05:58.397
Look, I don't know
what I would have done

05:58.432 --> 06:00.399
without my friends
when I was pregnant.

06:00.434 --> 06:02.535
You need to meet some girls,
some girls your age.

06:02.569 --> 06:06.505
Uh, it's kind of hard to make friends
with girls my age when I'm pregnant.

06:06.540 --> 06:08.641
Well, you made a friend
and you're pregnant.

06:08.675 --> 06:10.509
My point exactly.

06:11.645 --> 06:13.579
Ethan wants to be my friend,

06:13.614 --> 06:16.315
even maybe my boyfriend.

06:16.350 --> 06:19.285
You think there are any girls here who want
to be my friend?

06:19.319 --> 06:21.275
No.
And I don't care.

06:24.424 --> 06:26.425
You suck.
You suck.

06:28.729 --> 06:30.563
Kathy, that is not
how you make friends.

06:30.597 --> 06:32.365
She was staring at me.

06:32.399 --> 06:35.468
We were staring at her.
Thought she was going to say hello,

06:35.502 --> 06:37.236
at least, I was hoping
she was going to say hello.

06:37.270 --> 06:38.304
Well she didn't.

06:38.338 --> 06:40.306
Because you told her
that she sucks.

06:40.340 --> 06:43.209
Here.
Let me help you out.

06:43.243 --> 06:45.955
Hey, uh, excuse me.
You mind if I ask you a question?

06:46.075 --> 06:50.282
Get your hands off me and no, you can't
ask me something, weirdo.

06:51.618 --> 06:52.652
See?

06:54.688 --> 06:56.028
Hi, excuse me.

06:56.201 --> 06:57.290
I'm Amy Juergens.

06:57.410 --> 06:59.172
I thought you got married
to Ricky Underwood.

06:59.292 --> 06:59.837
Yeah, I did.

06:59.872 --> 07:01.805
Then how come your name
isn't Amy Underwood?

07:01.925 --> 07:03.926
Well, actually,
the name Underwood, either.

07:03.961 --> 07:05.178
It's totally lame.

07:05.298 --> 07:06.685
Yeah, it's gross.

07:06.777 --> 07:07.796
Amy Underpants.

07:07.916 --> 07:09.714
Who needs that?
Not you.

07:09.818 --> 07:12.755
Not after being
a teen mom and everything.

07:13.721 --> 07:15.465
Not that Yurgens is any better.

07:15.585 --> 07:17.119
Uh, it's "Juergens."

07:17.153 --> 07:19.254
Yeah, but it's really Yurgens.

07:19.288 --> 07:20.555
Amy Yurgens?

07:20.590 --> 07:23.291
(IN GERMAN ACCENT) Yeah, Yurgens
didn't wear underpants

07:23.326 --> 07:25.127
and that is how
she got pregnant.

07:25.161 --> 07:26.294
(CHUCKLING)

07:26.329 --> 07:29.564
Hey, maybe I could be
friends with you two.

07:29.599 --> 07:33.865
Yeah. You know, I've been dying to ask you
how you got pregnant.

07:33.985 --> 07:36.371
You know what sex is, right?

07:40.476 --> 07:45.247
Hey, so it looks like your little mentoree
made some friends.

07:45.281 --> 07:47.482
Now we don't have
to hang out with her.

07:47.517 --> 07:49.384
Well, that's not very nice.

07:49.419 --> 07:52.387
I thought you said you were
sick of hanging out with her.

07:52.422 --> 07:55.457
No. Not sick,
really. Just...

07:55.491 --> 07:58.260
I really think that she should
make some friends of her own,

07:58.294 --> 08:00.162
some girlfriends,
instead of just hanging out

08:00.196 --> 08:02.197
with Ethan, her new boyfriend.

08:02.231 --> 08:04.562
I don't think she should even have
a boyfriend, especially Ethan.

08:05.501 --> 08:07.569
You sound like
an old married lady.

08:07.603 --> 08:10.172
And I remind you, you pretty
much hung out with Ben

08:10.206 --> 08:13.408
the entire time you were pregnant
and forgot about Madison and me.

08:13.443 --> 08:15.477
I remember that
a little bit differently.

08:15.511 --> 08:17.546
Your parents didn't want you hanging
out with me when I was pregnant.

08:17.580 --> 08:20.515
Right. But they came
around eventually.

08:20.550 --> 08:23.418
Of course, I don't think you're
their favorite friend. Madison is.

08:23.453 --> 08:24.519
Madison slept
with your boyfriend.

08:24.554 --> 08:26.421
But she didn't get pregnant.

08:26.456 --> 08:27.556
And my parents
like her parents.

08:29.459 --> 08:32.561
My parents like
your parents, too.

08:32.595 --> 08:35.597
I don't think they'd go away on vacation
with your parents or anything, but...

08:37.232 --> 08:38.433
(SIGHS)

08:38.467 --> 08:42.070
This sounds negative when
all I wanted to do was say

08:42.105 --> 08:45.273
I'm happy for you that
Kathy made some friends.

08:45.308 --> 08:46.408
Now, I have to go meet Madison.

08:46.442 --> 08:48.176
Why can't I go meet Madison?

08:48.211 --> 08:51.246
Uh... 'Cause we're
looking for guys?

08:56.252 --> 08:57.252
(SIGHS)

08:57.587 --> 08:59.054
Hi.

08:59.355 --> 09:01.289
Hey, Grace.

09:01.324 --> 09:05.360
Hi. Um, I don't guess that you'd maybe
want to do something tonight, would you?

09:05.394 --> 09:06.461
Tonight?

09:06.496 --> 09:10.065
Yeah. My mom wants us
to try to be friends.

09:10.099 --> 09:13.268
Oh, yeah, I think my dad wants
the same thing. (CHUCKLES)

09:14.137 --> 09:16.171
Um, but, I mean,

09:16.205 --> 09:19.174
you've never not been my friend and
I've never not been your friend.

09:19.208 --> 09:21.376
We haven't been close, but
we haven't not been close.

09:21.410 --> 09:23.111
Right, yeah.

09:23.146 --> 09:27.449
And I owe it all to you that I
have a job at the church nursery.

09:27.483 --> 09:29.217
I'll always be grateful
to you for that.

09:29.252 --> 09:32.487
Thank you. Although, being
grateful is not quite the same as

09:32.522 --> 09:35.123
being a friend.

09:35.158 --> 09:36.525
Since I'm going
to church again,

09:36.559 --> 09:39.361
it's the same church that sponsors
the nursery where you work,

09:39.395 --> 09:41.363
it's just... It's really
difficult to make friends

09:41.397 --> 09:43.465
because people are totally
prejudiced against Christians,

09:43.499 --> 09:46.568
so I just thought maybe
we could be friends.

09:46.602 --> 09:48.236
But we're already friends.

09:48.271 --> 09:51.173
Great, let's hang out,
let's do something tonight.

09:51.207 --> 09:54.276
Grace, I have a baby.
I have John.

09:54.310 --> 09:56.411
And by the time
the church nursery closes

09:56.445 --> 09:58.413
and I get him home and I
bathe him and feed him

09:58.447 --> 10:00.348
and put him to bed
and do my homework,

10:00.383 --> 10:05.187
it's, like, 11:00 and
I have a husband, so...

10:05.221 --> 10:08.290
I don't really have time to hang out with
you or with any of my other friends.

10:08.324 --> 10:10.158
What if I came over
and I help you with John

10:10.193 --> 10:11.226
and we did
our homework together?

10:11.260 --> 10:12.460
And that would free you up
for more friend time.

10:12.495 --> 10:15.130
Well, it's just that
Ricky is in the apartment

10:15.164 --> 10:17.032
trying to study
at the same time.

10:17.066 --> 10:19.100
Then I'll bring Jack, too. I mean,
maybe the four of us can be friends.

10:19.135 --> 10:21.236
Thanks, Amy.
That's a great idea.

10:24.073 --> 10:25.207
(DIALING)

10:26.442 --> 10:27.442
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

10:29.212 --> 10:31.079
Hey, what's up?
Everything okay?

10:31.113 --> 10:33.148
Grace wants to come over
with Jack tonight.

10:33.182 --> 10:35.250
For what? Just to
hang out, be friends.

10:35.284 --> 10:36.484
What?

10:36.519 --> 10:39.154
My dad and Grace's mom want
Grace and me to be friends.

10:39.188 --> 10:41.156
What does that have to
do with Jack and me?

10:41.190 --> 10:43.091
Well, Jack is Grace's boyfriend
and you're my husband, so...

10:43.125 --> 10:44.259
So what?

10:44.293 --> 10:46.428
So, got roped into
doing this tonight

10:46.462 --> 10:48.396
and I'd like you
to go along with it.

10:48.431 --> 10:50.265
Hey, Ricky! Are you
coming in for a coffee?

10:50.299 --> 10:52.367
Yeah, I'll be right there.
Okay.

10:52.401 --> 10:54.502
Is that your friend?
Your friend Clementine?

10:54.537 --> 10:58.139
Yeah, you know, as long as people are
coming over, maybe she could come over too.

10:58.174 --> 11:00.041
To the apartment with
Grace and Jack?

11:00.076 --> 11:01.243
Wouldn't she be, like,
the third wheel?

11:01.277 --> 11:03.211
Wouldn't she be a fifth wheel?

11:03.246 --> 11:05.380
Fine, I don't care. Might as
well get that out of the way.

11:05.414 --> 11:08.049
What out of the way? Making
friends with your friends

11:08.084 --> 11:10.085
so that hopefully
she'll leave you alone.

11:10.119 --> 11:12.354
She's an old friend from a long time ago.
I never slept with her

11:12.388 --> 11:16.057
and I'd never sleep with her and if I tried
to sleep with anyone other than you,

11:16.092 --> 11:17.158
she'd probably kick my ass.

11:17.193 --> 11:18.226
What does that mean?

11:18.261 --> 11:20.161
That means I said
the wrong thing.

11:20.196 --> 11:22.330
I just want her to meet you.
And John.

11:22.365 --> 11:24.432
Fine.
Bring her over.

11:26.000 --> 11:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:34.443 --> 11:36.378
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
I wasn't thinking.

11:36.412 --> 11:38.146
Were you on the phone
with your wife?

11:38.180 --> 11:39.447
Yeah, that was Amy.

11:39.482 --> 11:42.183
She wants you to come over tonight.
She wants to meet you.

11:42.218 --> 11:44.185
Why?

11:44.220 --> 11:45.420
You're my friend. She thought
maybe you could be her friend.

11:45.454 --> 11:47.188
Really?

11:47.223 --> 11:48.523
Okay, I thought maybe
you could be her friend.

11:48.557 --> 11:50.525
My friend and her friend.

11:50.559 --> 11:52.394
I don't know.
Why not?

11:52.428 --> 11:55.130
Amy is a really nice girl and so are you.
I told her all about you.

11:55.164 --> 11:56.264
If you told her all about me,

11:56.299 --> 11:57.299
I doubt she'd want to meet me.

11:57.333 --> 11:59.200
No, she does,
she does, promise.

11:59.235 --> 12:01.002
All right. What time?

12:01.037 --> 12:02.270
She's usually home by seven.

12:02.305 --> 12:04.039
Are you sure about this?

12:04.073 --> 12:06.241
I don't feel like I can
hang out in the coffee shop

12:06.275 --> 12:08.343
unless Amy's comfortable
with our being friends.

12:08.377 --> 12:10.312
She's my wife.

12:10.346 --> 12:12.480
All right. But if it gets
boring, I'm leaving.

12:12.515 --> 12:14.316
It's not going to be boring.

12:14.350 --> 12:16.184
I have someone
I want you to meet.

12:16.218 --> 12:19.890
Oh? Why didn't you say so?
See you at seven.

12:28.998 --> 12:30.822
You want another cup of coffee?
I'll get the waitress.

12:30.922 --> 12:33.924
Oh, I don't know. I kind
of like those scones.

12:33.958 --> 12:35.091
I got it!

12:35.126 --> 12:37.398
So, you're not dating anyone?

12:37.860 --> 12:38.993
Kind of.

12:39.028 --> 12:42.117
But you know what they say
about relationships.

12:42.194 --> 12:44.186
"Sooner or later,
they're all over."

12:45.097 --> 12:47.098
Even your relationship
with Ricky.

12:47.133 --> 12:49.234
And yours.
Hey, Clementine,

12:49.268 --> 12:52.103
Adrian needs another cup
of coffee, do you mind?

12:52.138 --> 12:53.204
No, I don't mind.

12:53.239 --> 12:55.173
No, really, I'm fine.

12:55.207 --> 13:00.311
Fine? You must be exhausted.
Multitasking, multi-flirting.

13:00.346 --> 13:03.081
No, I'm used to it.

13:03.115 --> 13:06.735
I think jealousy uses much
more energy, negative energy.

13:06.855 --> 13:08.053
Are you feeling okay?

13:08.087 --> 13:10.255
Oh yeah, I'm good. I'm going
over to Ricky's tonight.

13:10.289 --> 13:11.356
Okay, everyone out!

13:11.390 --> 13:14.392
(SIGHS) Thanks, Adrian,
see you around.

13:14.427 --> 13:15.427
See you later.

13:15.461 --> 13:17.128
Text me.

13:20.066 --> 13:24.568
So, let me guess. You're going
over to Ricky's to meet Amy?

13:24.688 --> 13:28.073
Yeah, she says she wants to meet me.
She wants to be friends.

13:28.107 --> 13:29.174
You know her, right?

13:29.208 --> 13:31.309
Yeah, I know her.

13:31.343 --> 13:34.179
And I kind of doubt she wants
to be friends with you.

13:34.213 --> 13:35.380
She's not going to like you.

13:35.414 --> 13:37.082
She's probably setting you up.

13:37.116 --> 13:39.184
It is a setup. They're
introducing me to someone.

13:39.218 --> 13:43.088
Who? I don't know, but,
uh, should be fun.

13:43.122 --> 13:44.155
Could I have some more coffee?

13:44.190 --> 13:46.257
Oh, I'm sorry.
I just ran out.

13:46.292 --> 13:49.060
I'll have to make you
some new coffee.

13:55.468 --> 13:57.368
Hi.
Hi yourself.

13:57.403 --> 13:59.170
I was just thinking about you.

13:59.205 --> 14:01.072
That's nice.
I like the sound of that.

14:01.107 --> 14:02.941
It's the craziest thing.

14:02.975 --> 14:06.177
All my life, the only thoughts
I had were about one person.

14:06.212 --> 14:10.181
Me. I think it was mostly
a survival instinct.

14:10.216 --> 14:13.051
Anyway, suddenly
I'm walking along, alone,

14:13.085 --> 14:16.321
and then, bam! I think of you.
(CHUCKLES)

14:16.355 --> 14:20.158
And the next thing I know, I've
got this dumb grin on my face,

14:20.192 --> 14:22.060
like I'm high or loaded
or something.

14:22.094 --> 14:26.164
Only I'm not high or loaded.
I'm just thinking of you.

14:26.198 --> 14:28.032
Is that the grin?

14:28.467 --> 14:31.069
Yeah. I think that's it.

14:31.103 --> 14:32.403
It's not so dumb.

14:34.173 --> 14:35.240
You want to kiss me, don't you?

14:35.274 --> 14:37.175
Yeah. I do.

14:37.209 --> 14:38.409
But not here at school.

14:38.444 --> 14:40.979
We can't keep hiding out
in people's cars.

14:41.013 --> 14:43.148
Would your grandmother let us
make out in the living room?

14:43.182 --> 14:46.985
I think she would, but I wouldn't
be comfortable with that.

14:47.019 --> 14:48.319
Would your mother,
your foster mother,

14:48.354 --> 14:50.021
let us make out
in her living room?

14:50.055 --> 14:51.122
Not a chance.

14:51.157 --> 14:53.124
Is this him?
Yeah.

14:53.159 --> 14:54.325
What do you think?

14:54.360 --> 14:58.296
It's not bad, kind of the
dark and brooding type.

14:58.330 --> 15:01.232
Like James Franco, just not
as tall or good-looking.

15:01.267 --> 15:04.202
He looks either really smart
or really dumb. I can't tell.

15:04.236 --> 15:06.070
Uh... Who is this?

15:06.105 --> 15:08.373
We're her friends. Do you
have a problem with that?

15:08.407 --> 15:11.009
Yeah, I have
a problem with that.

15:11.043 --> 15:13.044
And I have a problem with you
looking at me like that.

15:13.078 --> 15:14.179
Who are you to look
at me like that?

15:14.181 --> 15:16.181
I don't like him. Let's go.
Me neither.

15:16.315 --> 15:17.315
Who are you to look
at me like that. Come on, Kathy.

15:17.349 --> 15:18.950
Bye.

15:18.984 --> 15:20.285
Wait.
I can't.

15:20.319 --> 15:23.121
Friends are really hard to get,
especially when you're pregnant.

15:23.155 --> 15:26.090
I'll talk to you later.

15:26.125 --> 15:28.259
Isn't it harder to get a
boyfriend when you're pregnant?

15:28.294 --> 15:30.061
(ALL GIGGLING)

15:30.095 --> 15:32.096
Ben just wants to see his girl.

15:32.131 --> 15:34.432
Ben needs some happiness in his life.
He deserves it.

15:34.466 --> 15:36.401
I don't feel like letting him
pretend to date me, okay?

15:36.435 --> 15:37.969
I don't like that.

15:38.003 --> 15:39.237
That would be using me
to do something

15:39.271 --> 15:41.206
that I don't even
think he should do.

15:41.240 --> 15:42.373
And Ben's my friend.

15:42.408 --> 15:45.009
He shouldn't ask me to do
something I don't want to do.

15:45.044 --> 15:47.011
I've got the harder part.
I have to go over

15:47.046 --> 15:49.347
and convince Dylan's parents
to let her go out with me.

15:49.381 --> 15:51.115
But I think I'm up
to the challenge.

15:51.150 --> 15:52.984
It could be fun.
Or not.

15:53.018 --> 15:57.021
And you don't have the harder part.
I have the harder part.

15:57.056 --> 16:00.925
He wants me to meet him at his
house and lie to Mr. Boykewich.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.927
If we all get caught, what's
Mr. Boykewich going to think of us

16:02.962 --> 16:04.195
after all he's done for us?

16:04.230 --> 16:06.130
He's going to think
we're Ben's friends.

16:06.165 --> 16:09.133
But we don't want Ben with Dylan.
We don't like Dylan.

16:09.168 --> 16:11.336
She's okay. No, she's not.
She got him in trouble.

16:11.370 --> 16:13.972
First it was the pot, then it
was the fire, what's next?

16:14.006 --> 16:16.307
Is she going to have him
murder someone? No.

16:16.342 --> 16:17.408
I'm not going to do it.
I don't like her.

16:17.443 --> 16:20.044
And I don't like
him dating her.

16:20.079 --> 16:22.981
And for once, he should do
what his father tells him

16:23.015 --> 16:25.016
and we should encourage him to
do what his father tells him.

16:25.050 --> 16:26.084
That's what a real
friend would do.

16:26.118 --> 16:28.086
That's not what a real
friend would do.

16:28.120 --> 16:31.389
A real friend would do anything a
friend needs him or her to do.

16:31.423 --> 16:33.157
I'm happy you said that.
Anything?

16:33.192 --> 16:34.259
Yeah.

16:34.293 --> 16:37.061
What if Ben asked you
to have sex with him.

16:37.096 --> 16:40.131
Well, that's ridiculous. Ben would
never ask me to have sex with him.

16:44.470 --> 16:46.437
Ben didn't...

16:46.472 --> 16:50.275
Ben didn't ask you to have
sex with him, did he?

16:51.243 --> 16:52.243
Did he?

16:53.145 --> 16:54.245
Did you?

16:55.414 --> 16:57.015
When! I want
to know when!

16:57.049 --> 16:58.916
Years ago? Months ago?
Weeks ago?

16:58.951 --> 17:02.253
It was the night of the fire.
But it was friend sex. I swear.

17:02.288 --> 17:07.959
He was just so desperate. He needed someone.
He needed comforting.

17:07.992 --> 17:09.060
So you slept with him?

17:10.329 --> 17:16.334
Just so we're perfectly clear,
you and Ben had sex?

17:16.367 --> 17:19.270
And he's been trying to make me feel
bad about sleeping with Adrian!

17:19.305 --> 17:21.306
And you didn't tell me?

17:21.339 --> 17:23.141
You just let me
feel bad about it?

17:23.175 --> 17:25.910
You let me agonize over
that one stupid mistake

17:25.944 --> 17:28.146
when the two of you did
something just as bad!

17:28.180 --> 17:29.914
Or even worse!

17:31.917 --> 17:34.095
What did I ever do to you
that you did this to me?

17:34.953 --> 17:36.187
Were you ever going to tell me?

17:36.221 --> 17:38.146
I mean, if you did this
just to get back at me

17:38.266 --> 17:40.631
for breaking up with me
I think you'd want me to know.

17:41.562 --> 17:43.101
Geez, Alice.

17:43.467 --> 17:44.830
That's really low.

17:46.431 --> 17:47.567
Henry!

17:47.687 --> 17:48.933
Pick me up at seven, okay?

17:48.967 --> 17:49.967
Seven.

17:51.103 --> 17:52.970
I got it.
I'll be there.

17:53.005 --> 17:54.772
What? You're gonna
go through with this?

17:55.274 --> 17:56.307
Oh, yeah.

17:56.342 --> 17:57.942
Game on.

18:08.796 --> 18:09.829
Hi.

18:09.864 --> 18:11.451
Hi.
You look really nice.

18:11.574 --> 18:13.373
Oh, thanks.

18:13.484 --> 18:15.452
Where do you wanna go
on our first date back?

18:15.486 --> 18:16.686
I got to be in early.
I got curfew, you know.

18:16.721 --> 18:18.788
Well, we were invited over
to Amy and Ricky's.

18:18.823 --> 18:20.690
What? Yeah, won't that be fun?

18:20.725 --> 18:22.425
I've never actually
been over there before.

18:22.460 --> 18:23.760
Yeah, me neither.

18:23.794 --> 18:26.093
And that's because we're not
really friends with Ricky and Amy.

18:26.213 --> 18:28.281
Yes, we are. We've
known them for years.

18:28.315 --> 18:29.416
That's where you want to go?

18:29.450 --> 18:31.217
I was going to take us out
for dinner or something.

18:31.252 --> 18:33.319
That's okay, I think they're just
going to order a pizza or something.

18:33.354 --> 18:35.955
They can't really go out
because of John.

18:35.990 --> 18:38.258
Great.
It'll be fun.

18:38.292 --> 18:41.027
I don't think it will. They're married.
They have a baby.

18:41.062 --> 18:43.997
Well, don't you want to get
married and have a baby someday?

18:44.031 --> 18:46.166
Someday. Not today. Not tonight.

18:46.200 --> 18:48.134
Tonight I just want to
spend some time with you.

18:48.169 --> 18:50.270
We don't need to spend
so much time alone.

18:50.304 --> 18:52.038
It only makes us
want to have sex.

18:52.073 --> 18:54.140
I'm always going to want
to have sex with you,

18:54.175 --> 18:55.308
so I'm just going to have
to wait until you tell me

18:55.342 --> 18:56.342
you want to have sex with me.

18:56.377 --> 18:58.144
All right, let's go.

19:06.020 --> 19:07.087
I just want to be with you.

19:07.121 --> 19:09.122
I know, I just...
I think it's healthier

19:09.156 --> 19:10.156
to spend time with friends.

19:10.191 --> 19:11.324
How is that healthier?

19:11.358 --> 19:14.060
Because if you start acting
stupid or something

19:14.095 --> 19:15.128
or you're not nice to me,

19:15.162 --> 19:17.197
Amy will point it out
if I don't notice.

19:17.231 --> 19:18.298
Girls need girlfriends
for that.

19:18.332 --> 19:20.100
I'm not going to be
not nice to you.

19:20.134 --> 19:21.968
Why would I be not nice to you?
I'm in love with you.

19:22.002 --> 19:24.237
It was just an example.

19:24.271 --> 19:27.307
I want a friend.
I want us to have friends.

19:27.341 --> 19:29.209
I liked it better when you
were friends with Adrian.

19:29.243 --> 19:31.945
That is over. Let's go.

19:31.979 --> 19:33.379
All right.
Not "all right."

19:33.414 --> 19:35.982
I want you to be enthusiastic
about whatever I want to do.

19:36.016 --> 19:37.250
Even when it's
something stupid like

19:37.284 --> 19:39.185
going to a married
couple's apartment

19:39.220 --> 19:41.221
and babysitting as our
first date back together?

19:41.255 --> 19:43.022
That doesn't sound
very enthusiastic.

19:43.057 --> 19:44.424
I can't wait!
(GASPS) There we go.

19:46.093 --> 19:47.093
(SIGHS)

19:52.433 --> 19:55.034
Oh, Leo, I'm sorry I'm late.

19:55.069 --> 19:56.369
Crazy day at work.

19:58.405 --> 20:01.040
Relax, glad you could
make it, good to see you.

20:01.075 --> 20:02.208
How was your day?

20:02.243 --> 20:03.309
Oh, it was good.

20:03.344 --> 20:05.145
Yeah? Any word
from the school board?

20:05.179 --> 20:07.113
Oh, I heard from
them, all right.

20:07.148 --> 20:09.449
They let him off the hook, but
it wasn't easy, let me tell you.

20:09.483 --> 20:11.084
That's great news!

20:11.118 --> 20:12.118
I guess.

20:12.153 --> 20:14.187
You guess?
Leo, come on.

20:14.221 --> 20:15.388
Ben didn't burn down the school

20:15.422 --> 20:17.423
and he didn't get
kicked out of school

20:17.458 --> 20:19.392
or get anyone else kicked out.
That's the best possible outcome.

20:19.426 --> 20:21.161
It's over!
Congratulations!

20:21.195 --> 20:23.029
Oh, it's far from over.

20:23.063 --> 20:25.131
He has to get through the rest of the
school year without getting in trouble.

20:25.166 --> 20:27.066
He won't get in anymore trouble.
He's not a bad kid.

20:27.101 --> 20:28.468
Dylan's still circling around.

20:28.502 --> 20:31.104
Oh, another girl will come along
and he'll forget all about her.

20:31.138 --> 20:33.373
(KNOCKING)
No, I won't.

20:33.407 --> 20:35.041
Ben! I heard
the good news.

20:35.075 --> 20:36.309
Yeah?

20:36.343 --> 20:38.077
Yeah. Congratulations! We should
all go out and celebrate.

20:38.112 --> 20:39.379
He can't go out.
He's on restriction.

20:39.413 --> 20:41.014
Oh, Leo.

20:41.048 --> 20:43.082
Wait. I'm on restriction
from seeing Dylan,

20:43.117 --> 20:45.185
but I can still go out.
I'm going out with Alice,

20:45.219 --> 20:46.486
uh, we're going to go
catch a movie or something.

20:46.520 --> 20:48.454
Oh, are you? Yeah,
she's coming over.

20:48.489 --> 20:50.323
I will just be in the kitchen.

20:52.193 --> 20:55.094
That's okay, isn't it?
Going out with Alice?

20:55.129 --> 20:56.196
Where's Henry?

20:56.230 --> 20:58.331
Uh, I don't know.
Alice probably called him.

20:58.365 --> 20:59.399
We'll probably meet up.

20:59.433 --> 21:01.201
Probably?

21:01.235 --> 21:03.303
It's not a big deal. Are you
leaving out Henry for some reason?

21:03.337 --> 21:06.039
No.
You and Alice dating?

21:06.073 --> 21:07.207
Got plans to sleep
with her again?

21:07.241 --> 21:09.008
Dad! No.

21:09.043 --> 21:11.144
We are not dating, exactly.

21:11.178 --> 21:13.146
And I do not have plans
to sleep with her.

21:13.180 --> 21:15.181
But if that were
going to happen,

21:15.216 --> 21:16.950
you wouldn't have Henry around.

21:16.984 --> 21:18.218
Oh, I'll call Henry.

21:18.252 --> 21:20.053
Henry doesn't know
you slept with Alice?

21:20.087 --> 21:21.955
No. He does not.

21:21.989 --> 21:23.323
And I'd like to forget that ever
happened and so would Alice.

21:23.357 --> 21:25.291
Let me make a suggestion.

21:25.326 --> 21:28.094
Hang out with Henry, or Henry
and Alice, not just Alice.

21:28.128 --> 21:30.330
You slept with her.
She's not just a friend.

21:30.364 --> 21:32.398
Geez, Dad,
what is going on here?

21:32.433 --> 21:36.102
What is going on here is I think you might
be sneaking around trying to see Dylan.

21:36.136 --> 21:37.270
Where did that come from?

21:37.304 --> 21:39.239
I'll tell you
where it came from.

21:39.273 --> 21:42.442
Dylan's father. He called me asking
about Henry, if I know Henry.

21:42.476 --> 21:44.110
Dylan's going out
with Henry tonight.

21:44.144 --> 21:45.178
He is not!

21:46.480 --> 21:48.214
Henry would not date Dylan.

21:48.249 --> 21:50.149
Why not? You're not
dating her anymore.

21:50.184 --> 21:53.286
Well, I mean, he can
date her if he wants,

21:53.320 --> 21:54.454
but he knows I still like her.

21:54.488 --> 21:57.290
I don't think he would
ask her out on a date.

21:57.324 --> 21:59.359
But then again, I guess he did.

21:59.393 --> 22:02.228
Huh. It's, uh...
I can't believe that.

22:02.263 --> 22:03.329
Fancy that.

22:03.364 --> 22:05.298
I can't either.

22:05.332 --> 22:07.200
You're not maybe planning on
going to the movies with Alice

22:07.234 --> 22:09.369
and then bumping into
Henry and Dylan

22:09.403 --> 22:11.271
and doing a little
do-si-do, are you?

22:13.340 --> 22:16.342
Go back upstairs. You're not going anywhere.
And give me your phone.

22:19.246 --> 22:20.246
What's the code?

22:21.015 --> 22:22.115
D-Y-L-A-N.

22:22.149 --> 22:23.249
(SIGHS) I figured.

22:23.284 --> 22:25.351
Look, come on, Dad,
just let me go out with her.

22:25.386 --> 22:27.253
Adrian's boyfriend is
asking her to marry him

22:27.288 --> 22:31.257
and she's practically engaged and
Amy's married and it's not fair!

22:31.292 --> 22:34.093
See ya. Can I at least call Alice
and tell her not to come over?

22:34.128 --> 22:35.962
Her number's in
your contacts, right?

22:35.996 --> 22:37.063
I'll call her.

22:37.097 --> 22:39.299
All right, that's just
an invasion of privacy!

22:39.333 --> 22:42.201
Go. I'm too old to
be sent to my room!

22:42.236 --> 22:44.170
I'm divorced!
I've lost a child!

22:44.204 --> 22:46.005
I'm over 18.
I'm an adult!

22:46.040 --> 22:48.274
Then start acting like an adult.
I'm done here. Go.

22:50.210 --> 22:52.111
(DIALING)

22:58.185 --> 23:00.153
Alice? Uh, It's me.
It's Leo.

23:00.187 --> 23:04.057
Oh, hi, Mr. Boykewich.
You have Ben's phone?

23:04.091 --> 23:07.093
Yes, I do. Oh, no, did you
tell him that you know?

23:07.127 --> 23:09.996
Yeah, but I told him, uh,
Dylan's dad told me.

23:10.030 --> 23:11.164
Oh. Thank you.

23:11.198 --> 23:14.334
No, thank you for telling me.
You did the right thing.

23:14.368 --> 23:16.169
And I just wanted
to let you know

23:16.203 --> 23:17.669
you don't need to come over.

23:17.789 --> 23:19.205
He's not going anywhere.

23:19.239 --> 23:20.440
Okay. Thanks.

23:24.445 --> 23:26.145
Henry!

23:26.180 --> 23:28.348
Hi! Come in. I want you
to meet my parents.

23:39.424 --> 23:41.119
I never smoked weed.

23:41.552 --> 23:42.375
Marijuana.

23:42.540 --> 23:44.048
Thank you
for the clarification.

23:44.168 --> 23:45.709
And I've never had a drink.

23:45.743 --> 23:48.545
Filipino parents
are very strict.

23:48.579 --> 23:50.514
What time would you like me
to bring your daughter home?

23:50.548 --> 23:53.450
We haven't said she can
go out with you yet.

23:53.484 --> 23:55.519
Uh, how do you two
know each other?

23:55.553 --> 23:57.320
Dad, from school?

23:57.355 --> 24:00.290
Actually, and I don't think
you know this, Dylan.

24:00.324 --> 24:03.293
I first saw you at the same
party where you met Ben.

24:03.327 --> 24:04.561
I even pointed you out to Ben,

24:04.595 --> 24:09.332
because I took one look at you
and I was totally smitten.

24:09.367 --> 24:12.569
But Ben Boykewich moved in on
you before I even had a chance.

24:12.603 --> 24:13.703
Huh.
Interesting.

24:13.738 --> 24:15.338
Yeah.

24:15.373 --> 24:17.741
We should go.
No, we shouldn't.

24:17.775 --> 24:20.544
If you were my daughter, I wouldn't
just let you walk out of the house

24:20.578 --> 24:22.312
with some guy I don't know.

24:22.346 --> 24:23.680
Ask me anything you want.

24:23.714 --> 24:25.749
And I will try to answer honestly
and to the best of my ability.

24:25.783 --> 24:27.484
Would you like a piece of cake?

24:27.518 --> 24:29.686
Honestly? Yes.
I have a real sweet tooth.

24:29.720 --> 24:31.288
What's your favorite dessert?

24:31.322 --> 24:32.556
Whatever you like to bake.

24:34.292 --> 24:35.292
What does your father do?

24:35.326 --> 24:36.526
He's a male nurse.

24:36.561 --> 24:39.396
He works in assisted care.
He wanted to be a doctor

24:39.430 --> 24:41.431
but his dad died
when he was young

24:41.466 --> 24:43.333
and he had to take care
of my grandmother

24:43.367 --> 24:45.502
and that's how
he got into the field.

24:45.536 --> 24:49.406
He's very patient.
He likes older people.

24:49.440 --> 24:51.441
Our culture is very
respectful of the elderly.

24:51.476 --> 24:53.443
What would your family say

24:53.478 --> 24:56.246
if someday you wanted to marry
someone outside of your culture?

24:56.280 --> 24:58.682
I've already asked. We've
discussed it at length,

24:58.716 --> 25:02.252
and my parents feel
that matters of the heart

25:02.286 --> 25:04.588
should be decided by the heart.

25:06.657 --> 25:11.261
Okay, if we're going to get to the
7:30 show, we really should be going.

25:11.295 --> 25:12.629
But he didn't get his cake.
Let me get the cake.

25:12.663 --> 25:15.265
We don't have time. HENRY:
We should take the time.

25:15.299 --> 25:16.466
If we're going to be
in a relationship,

25:16.501 --> 25:18.602
we want to get off
to a good start.

25:18.636 --> 25:20.704
You know what? Why don't
we just hang out here?

25:20.738 --> 25:22.272
Do you like board games?

25:22.306 --> 25:25.308
Henry, I really
want to see the movie.

25:25.343 --> 25:26.610
The 7:30 movie.

25:26.644 --> 25:29.479
What you want, Dylan,
is very important to me.

25:29.514 --> 25:32.616
But what your parents want
is just as important.

25:34.385 --> 25:37.320
Good man. Nice to
get some respect.

25:45.329 --> 25:48.465
You sleep on the bed. Let
the girls sleep on these.

25:48.499 --> 25:51.234
Okay, I'm sure they won't mind.

25:51.269 --> 25:52.569
Thank you so much for
letting them come over.

25:52.603 --> 25:54.404
Letting them?

25:54.438 --> 25:55.539
Honey, this is your house, too,

25:55.573 --> 25:58.475
and your friends are
always welcome here.

25:58.509 --> 25:59.709
I'm so happy
you made some friends.

25:59.744 --> 26:01.478
I know how lonely you've been.

26:01.512 --> 26:04.381
Yeah, my old friends
kind of abandoned me.

26:04.415 --> 26:06.383
Ah, who needs them?

26:06.417 --> 26:10.253
You're a darling girl. You're
smart and you're a lot of fun.

26:10.288 --> 26:11.454
You girls have
a good time tonight.

26:13.291 --> 26:16.526
Now, I've got pizzas and salad,

26:16.561 --> 26:18.728
there's some fruit,
popcorn, cookies.

26:18.763 --> 26:20.697
There's some leftover chicken.

26:20.731 --> 26:24.501
I can make some flautas and guacamole.
Whatever you want.

26:24.535 --> 26:27.337
I think the pizza and
the salad will be enough.

26:27.371 --> 26:28.471
Thank you so much.
(PHONE RINGING)

26:33.511 --> 26:34.644
Hi.

26:34.679 --> 26:36.446
So are we doing
something tonight or not?

26:36.480 --> 26:37.581
I can't.

26:37.615 --> 26:39.482
My girlfriends
are sleeping over.

26:39.517 --> 26:41.351
I'm having a sleepover.

26:41.385 --> 26:44.354
This is like the first normal thing
I've done since I got pregnant.

26:44.388 --> 26:47.223
All right, well... Just let
me know where I fit in here.

26:47.258 --> 26:50.293
Okay, I'll talk it over with Jody
and Francine and I'll let you know.

26:50.328 --> 26:51.428
(SCOFFS)

26:51.462 --> 26:52.596
I'm just joking.

26:52.630 --> 26:55.298
Oh, yeah? Well, not funny.
And...

26:57.268 --> 27:00.337
You know what? This isn't going to work out.
I have to go.

27:04.475 --> 27:06.343
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

27:08.312 --> 27:09.646
No, I have to go.

27:14.452 --> 27:18.254
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

27:18.289 --> 27:20.457
And I don't like your friends, either.
They're not nice.

27:20.491 --> 27:23.293
What does that have to do with anything?
They're still my friends.

27:23.327 --> 27:25.362
We'll see.
Yeah, we will.

27:29.634 --> 27:31.401
Boyfriend problems?

27:31.435 --> 27:33.236
He thinks my friends
aren't nice.

27:33.270 --> 27:35.538
And why would he say that?
Because they aren't.

27:35.573 --> 27:39.242
But it's high school
and you have to have friends

27:39.276 --> 27:40.577
and these are the only friends
I can get right now.

27:45.383 --> 27:49.185
Ooh, let's make some spicy ones.
Amy doesn't like spicy.

27:49.220 --> 27:50.420
Actually, she prefers no meat.

27:50.454 --> 27:51.488
You work at a butcher shop.

27:51.522 --> 27:53.289
Yeah.

27:53.324 --> 27:56.259
Okay, what about we make some
hot sauce to dip them in?

27:56.293 --> 27:57.293
Good idea.

27:58.262 --> 28:00.397
Remember that time...
No.

28:00.431 --> 28:01.665
Not unless you tell me the time.

28:01.699 --> 28:04.267
You got the fusilli
stuck up your nose?

28:04.301 --> 28:06.469
Okay, whose idea was that?

28:06.504 --> 28:09.406
And Mrs. Ramsey called the
fire department to get it out.

28:09.440 --> 28:12.308
I was turning blue in the face.
I stuck it up both...

28:12.343 --> 28:13.610
Oh, hi.

28:13.644 --> 28:17.247
Oh, hi, Amy. I didn't
hear you come in.

28:17.281 --> 28:19.315
Hi, I take it you're Clementine?

28:19.350 --> 28:22.385
Yeah. Nice to meet you.
And who's this?

That's the guy
I wanted you to meet.

28:25.656 --> 28:28.625
That's our son, John.

28:28.659 --> 28:31.261
Hey, John, say hi to
daddy's friend Clementine.

28:32.430 --> 28:33.430
No.

28:39.236 --> 28:40.336
(SIGHS)

28:48.859 --> 28:50.689
It's a great apartment.

28:50.809 --> 28:52.672
Thanks, yeah, we're good.

28:53.898 --> 28:56.867
So, how long
have you been married?

28:56.901 --> 28:58.702
Um, just a couple of weeks now.

28:58.736 --> 29:00.871
Oh, whoa, so you just
got married.

29:00.905 --> 29:02.739
I'll have to get you
a wedding present.

29:02.774 --> 29:04.708
Oh, no, no, please.

29:04.742 --> 29:06.510
You don't have to do that.

29:08.480 --> 29:10.614
So, you're a sophomore?
Yeah.

29:10.648 --> 29:11.815
Are you a freshman somewhere?

29:11.850 --> 29:14.718
No, I'm a senior.
In high school.

29:14.752 --> 29:16.787
I'll be going to college next year.
I hope.

29:16.821 --> 29:19.656
Great. You're gonna love it.
I love it.

29:19.691 --> 29:20.691
Great.

29:22.794 --> 29:24.862
So, do you, like, have a
boyfriend or anything?

29:24.896 --> 29:30.767
No. I went out with this guy
recently, but he's a jock.

29:30.802 --> 29:32.769
You know how jocks are.

29:32.804 --> 29:36.573
It was just, you know,
a physical thing, I guess.

29:36.608 --> 29:37.808
For him, anyway.

29:37.842 --> 29:40.577
Actually, I don't really
know how that is.

29:40.612 --> 29:42.579
I've only really dated Ricky

29:42.614 --> 29:44.615
and a couple of
other guys, but no jocks.

29:44.649 --> 29:46.517
Well, I mean,
Ricky is a jock, right?

29:46.551 --> 29:48.652
He's an amazing
baseball player.

29:49.521 --> 29:50.554
Or did he give that up?

29:50.588 --> 29:52.456
Yeah, I guess
he did give it up.

29:52.490 --> 29:55.459
Oh, man, he was playing
for this team one summer

29:55.493 --> 29:56.660
and they were
going to nationals

29:56.694 --> 29:58.662
and he had a no-hit
season going.

29:58.696 --> 30:03.700
It was unprecedented. His name is
probably on some plaque or something.

30:03.735 --> 30:08.539
And then he drew a bunch of
body parts on the bases.

30:08.573 --> 30:11.542
Like first base for first base,
second base for second...

30:11.576 --> 30:13.544
Yeah, I get it.
(CHUCKLES)

30:13.578 --> 30:17.481
He thought it would inspire the
guys to try a little bit harder

30:17.515 --> 30:19.583
but the other team's
coach saw it,

30:19.617 --> 30:23.820
protested, and had him kicked off
the team and they lost without him.

30:23.855 --> 30:26.757
So, maybe his name
is not on a plaque.

30:26.791 --> 30:29.660
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Oh, excuse me,

30:29.694 --> 30:31.662
I have friends
dropping over, too.

30:36.801 --> 30:38.802
Hi, Amy.

30:38.836 --> 30:40.671
Hi.
Hey, come on in.

30:40.705 --> 30:43.907
Sorry we're late. We wanted
to stop and get some dessert.

30:43.942 --> 30:45.943
Oh, hi.
I'm Grace.

30:46.678 --> 30:47.744
I'm...

30:47.779 --> 30:49.646
Clementine.
Yeah.

30:49.681 --> 30:52.516
This is Jack.
And we're Christians.

30:52.550 --> 30:54.451
Oh. Interesting.

30:54.485 --> 30:56.553
Clementine is at
the same college

30:56.588 --> 30:57.788
that Ricky and Jack go to.

30:57.822 --> 30:59.456
Hi, Clementine.

30:59.490 --> 31:00.924
Hi. I should be going.

31:00.959 --> 31:03.493
Oh, no, please stay.

31:03.528 --> 31:04.928
Ricky's just getting
John down to bed.

31:04.963 --> 31:08.465
I really should be going. Thank
you so much for inviting me over

31:08.499 --> 31:10.601
and letting me
meet you and John.

31:10.635 --> 31:12.869
Ricky loves you both so much.

31:12.904 --> 31:15.839
But the meatballs...
I have work tomorrow.

31:15.873 --> 31:17.774
Hey, it was nice
meeting you, uh...

31:17.809 --> 31:19.509
It's Grace.
Grace.

31:19.777 --> 31:20.844
And Jack, right?

31:28.686 --> 31:29.686
(CLEARS THROAT)

31:30.488 --> 31:31.521
You slept with her?

31:35.460 --> 31:37.661
I feel bad that Ben
didn't want to eat with us.

31:37.695 --> 31:40.697
I felt badly he lied
to me yet again.

31:40.732 --> 31:42.799
Well, Leo, maybe you're just going
to have to let him date Dylan.

31:42.834 --> 31:44.635
No, I'm not.

31:44.669 --> 31:46.837
I want to say
something, if I may...

31:46.871 --> 31:49.740
I hope, whatever it is,
it starts with an apology.

31:49.774 --> 31:51.541
No. It doesn't.

31:51.576 --> 31:53.677
I just want to say that if you're
going to tell me who to date,

31:53.711 --> 31:55.779
I think I should have every
right to tell you who to date.

31:55.813 --> 31:57.814
What!

31:57.849 --> 31:59.783
Yeah. And unless you plan
on getting her pregnant

31:59.817 --> 32:02.886
or importing some offspring from
some other source and adopting them,

32:02.920 --> 32:04.621
you should quit dating Camille.

32:04.656 --> 32:06.523
No offense, Camille.
Are you drunk?

32:06.557 --> 32:07.858
No, I'm perfectly sober.

32:07.892 --> 32:09.693
Last time, you married a
hooker and I didn't speak up.

32:09.727 --> 32:10.894
This time I'm speaking up.

32:10.928 --> 32:12.829
You two do not belong together.

32:12.864 --> 32:14.865
You're too fat and
she's too thin.

32:14.899 --> 32:16.667
She probably can't even
get pregnant.

32:16.701 --> 32:18.535
If she could, she would have
trapped you by now.

32:23.541 --> 32:24.541
(GROANS)

32:25.877 --> 32:26.877
(LAUGHING)

32:30.515 --> 32:31.548
You want to get married?

32:31.582 --> 32:32.582
Ow.

32:33.551 --> 32:34.584
Well?

32:34.619 --> 32:35.752
Seriously?
Yeah.

32:35.787 --> 32:38.655
Yeah.
(LAUGHING)

32:38.690 --> 32:39.690
(WHISPERS)
That really hurt.

32:42.794 --> 32:44.695
(GROANING)

32:49.348 --> 32:50.560
I knew they weren't gonna come.

32:51.083 --> 32:52.117
Maybe they got lost.

32:52.151 --> 32:54.420
Maybe they got lost and
they lost my phone number.

32:56.900 --> 32:58.488
It was just a big joke on me.

32:59.803 --> 33:00.836
I'm such an idiot.

33:00.870 --> 33:02.705
No one wants to be
friends with me.

33:02.739 --> 33:05.507
I am sure there's
some explanation.

33:05.542 --> 33:07.776
Get real, Grandma.

33:08.153 --> 33:10.921
I'm pregnant and I'm new
at the school

33:10.955 --> 33:12.856
and no one wants
anything to do with me.

33:14.658 --> 33:16.894
And I knew it was going to
be that way going into this.

33:16.928 --> 33:18.062
Honey, don't say that.

33:18.096 --> 33:20.898
And, of course,
I blew it with Ethan

33:20.932 --> 33:22.766
because I was
the "b" word to him.

33:23.935 --> 33:25.035
Bitch.

33:25.070 --> 33:29.206
Yes, I'm just surprised
you said "'b' word."

33:29.240 --> 33:31.473
You have a tendency
to use foul language,

33:31.593 --> 33:34.978
which I'm not completely opposed
to when it's called for.

33:36.014 --> 33:37.367
Why don't you call him?

33:37.487 --> 33:39.083
Oh, I can't.
I'll call him.

33:39.117 --> 33:42.886
No, it's stupid for me
to have a boyfriend.

33:44.111 --> 33:45.923
It's bad timing.

33:45.957 --> 33:46.957
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

33:48.827 --> 33:50.551
I already called him.

33:51.595 --> 33:54.932
Stay off the bed. Or the
one she's on, anyway.

33:59.003 --> 34:00.971
So, mind if I come in?

34:01.005 --> 34:02.039
I guess not.

34:02.073 --> 34:03.874
I told you those two
weren't nice.

34:03.908 --> 34:05.976
You came over here
to tell me you told me so?

34:06.010 --> 34:08.045
Yeah.

34:08.079 --> 34:10.947
And I wanted to show you
how much nicer I am.

34:10.982 --> 34:12.815
That's because you want
to make out with me.

34:12.851 --> 34:16.186
Uh, not in here. It's a
little intimate, you know.

34:16.221 --> 34:19.022
And it would be a little difficult
since I can't sit on that bed.

34:20.759 --> 34:23.193
Maybe I'll just sit...
Over here.

34:27.799 --> 34:29.699
I feel like such a loser.

34:29.734 --> 34:30.801
I have no girlfriends.

34:30.835 --> 34:32.936
I don't have
any friends either,

34:32.971 --> 34:35.005
but I'm not a loser
and neither are you.

34:35.039 --> 34:37.107
It's not that I'm feeling
sorry for myself, but...

34:39.043 --> 34:41.779
I miss my room.
I miss my bed.

34:41.813 --> 34:44.915
I miss my pets,
my friends, my family.

34:46.150 --> 34:50.788
And most of all,
I miss my virginity.

34:50.822 --> 34:53.090
Well, if you want,
you can have mine.

34:54.025 --> 34:55.058
(CHUCKLING)

34:55.092 --> 34:57.861
Shut up. I knew you
were going to say that.

34:57.896 --> 35:00.097
So, what were you girls going to
do at your sleepover, anyway?

35:00.131 --> 35:03.934
Talk about you. I told you
that's my favorite subject.

35:03.968 --> 35:05.769
We can talk about me
all you want.

35:11.109 --> 35:13.844
Cecilia, you are a heck
of a mah-jongg player.

35:13.878 --> 35:15.078
Played growing up.

35:15.113 --> 35:18.081
I'm still lost.
Next time, poker.

35:18.116 --> 35:20.717
Oh, I don't gamble, but if
you make it penny poker,

35:20.752 --> 35:21.985
I might be willing
to lose a buck or two.

35:23.822 --> 35:26.123
Put the phone away, Dylan.
You have company.

35:26.157 --> 35:27.825
Just texting my girlfriends.

35:27.859 --> 35:28.859
It's time for me to leave.

35:28.893 --> 35:30.060
Oh, It's only 9:00.

35:30.094 --> 35:33.664
We could have some coffee,
watch a movie. More cake?

35:33.698 --> 35:34.832
Oh, the cake was awesome.

35:34.866 --> 35:37.801
But really, I don't want
to overstay my welcome,

35:37.836 --> 35:40.804
so, Dylan, do you want
to walk me to the door?

35:41.940 --> 35:43.006
Go ahead, Dylan.
Go ahead.

35:44.776 --> 35:46.043
Of course.

35:52.917 --> 35:55.719
What are you doing? Ben has
been waiting for hours.

35:55.753 --> 35:57.754
Oh, I doubt it.
You doubt it?

35:57.789 --> 36:01.058
Okay, let me rephrase that.
I don't care.

36:01.092 --> 36:04.728
I don't care about Ben.
I care about you.

36:04.762 --> 36:08.999
And I did see you first at that party
and I am really smitten with you.

36:09.033 --> 36:11.869
And I'm angry with myself for
stepping aside for my friend.

36:11.903 --> 36:13.770
You slept with
Ben's wife that night.

36:13.805 --> 36:17.941
Yeah, I did. And it was
a huge mistake, huge.

36:17.976 --> 36:20.911
But stepping aside,
huger mistake.

36:21.372 --> 36:23.113
He doesn't deserve you.

36:23.492 --> 36:26.083
He's in love with Amy. He's
always been in love with Amy,

36:28.052 --> 36:30.493
so don't waste your time.

36:32.258 --> 36:35.726
And I hope you'll
give me a chance.

36:49.488 --> 36:51.422
Good night, Robert.
Good night, Cecilia.

36:51.456 --> 36:52.456
BOTH: Good night, Henry.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.734
He's such a slut.

37:03.769 --> 37:05.281
He's probably slept with half
the girls on the campus already.

37:05.402 --> 37:06.802
JACK: No, I haven't.

37:06.837 --> 37:09.405
You know how much it costs me to
fill up my truck? A hundred bucks.

37:09.439 --> 37:11.607
Get a hybrid, man.
It's the only way to go.

37:11.642 --> 37:13.676
Uh, a little too girly for me.

37:13.710 --> 37:15.678
Oh, yeah, that's right, sorry.

37:15.712 --> 37:18.781
It was a free car. My parents
gave it to me, so...

37:18.815 --> 37:20.816
It is a little girly, but I'd
have to have a very good reason

37:20.851 --> 37:22.752
if I wanted to trade it in.

37:23.115 --> 37:25.016
You got a family.
You need something bigger.

37:25.050 --> 37:27.752
Amy's got a bigger car.
Of course, it's orange.

37:27.786 --> 37:28.953
Why did she pick orange?

37:28.988 --> 37:30.955
I don't know, some friend
of her mother's gave it to her

37:30.990 --> 37:32.657
just to annoy her dad.

37:32.691 --> 37:33.858
You both got free cars?

37:33.892 --> 37:36.094
Yeah, so no car payments.

37:36.128 --> 37:38.763
If we had car payments,
we'd be in trouble.

37:38.797 --> 37:39.931
You got a scholarship, right?

37:39.965 --> 37:41.733
Yeah, you got one too, right?
Yeah.

37:41.767 --> 37:42.967
Yours is based on academics,

37:43.002 --> 37:45.069
but mine a depends on my game

37:45.104 --> 37:46.771
and the coach isn't
too happy with me right now.

37:46.805 --> 37:48.606
Yeah, well, you gotta do
what you gotta do.

37:48.641 --> 37:49.641
I don't know.

37:51.382 --> 37:53.077
Grace, he was with Clementine

37:53.112 --> 37:54.460
before you guys were
even back together.

37:54.616 --> 37:56.617
He was with Clementine knowing we
were going to get back together.

37:56.651 --> 37:58.352
All right, well,
aren't you happy

37:58.386 --> 38:00.387
that you didn't
have sex with him?

38:00.422 --> 38:02.656
I mean, aren't you happy
that you decided to wait?

38:02.691 --> 38:06.381
Not to wait, but to
wait to do it again?

38:07.395 --> 38:09.496
'Cause you're
worth waiting for.

38:09.531 --> 38:11.498
And if Jack's not ready,
then he's not ready.

38:11.533 --> 38:13.567
Let him do whatever
he wants to do.

38:13.601 --> 38:16.537
You just have to stay
committed to yourself

38:16.571 --> 38:18.472
and your beliefs
and who you are.

38:18.506 --> 38:21.508
Wow. I wish we had been
closer the last few years.

38:21.543 --> 38:23.377
Well, it would have
been awkward,

38:23.411 --> 38:26.714
considering my mother and your
mother were not so friendly.

38:27.320 --> 38:29.254
Yeah. Think they'll
ever be friends?

38:29.289 --> 38:30.416
Yeah. I do.

38:30.536 --> 38:33.482
My mother is clearly not interested
in being with my father anymore.

38:33.602 --> 38:36.674
How's that going? For you, I mean?
Is it weird?

38:36.794 --> 38:38.718
Uh, yeah.
(CHUCKLES)

38:38.838 --> 38:40.005
Yeah, it is.

38:40.125 --> 38:42.314
But you know, she should
be who she is, too,

38:42.434 --> 38:43.581
and I just have
to get used to that.

38:43.701 --> 38:46.271
Do you think your dad and my
mom will ever get married?

38:46.306 --> 38:49.685
Think we'll ever be sisters?

38:49.805 --> 38:51.566
I wouldn't mind. I always
kind of wanted a sister.

38:51.686 --> 38:53.560
I always wanted a nice sister.

38:53.787 --> 38:54.998
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

38:55.348 --> 38:57.551
Let me get that.

38:57.671 --> 38:59.217
Ugh, she better not
have come back.

38:59.252 --> 39:00.252
(SIGHS)

39:03.256 --> 39:04.923
RICKY: Who is it?
ADRIAN: It's me.

39:06.296 --> 39:09.224
I'm not going to be left out.
I'm not interested in you.

39:09.344 --> 39:11.748
Where's Clementine?
What are you doing here?

39:11.868 --> 39:13.261
Why shouldn't I be here?

39:13.379 --> 39:15.680
I'm friends with all of you.

39:15.714 --> 39:17.749
I heard from Clementine you
were having a little party.

39:17.783 --> 39:19.684
I had to hear it from her.

39:19.718 --> 39:22.221
What, am I not good enough to hang
out with the rest of you now?

39:22.341 --> 39:24.556
Oh, no. Come on in. You're welcome
to come over whenever you want.

39:24.590 --> 39:26.524
But you should bring Omar because
this is like a couples thing.

39:26.559 --> 39:29.087
Oh, geez, I'll just be
in the kitchen.

39:35.501 --> 39:38.603
So? Where is she?
Jack slept with her.

39:38.637 --> 39:41.406
That slut!
Her or Jack?

39:41.440 --> 39:42.507
Both.

39:42.541 --> 39:43.608
And you know what, Amy?

39:43.642 --> 39:45.543
I think she's after Ricky.

39:45.578 --> 39:47.035
But don't worry.
I got your back.

39:47.155 --> 39:49.814
I am not worried. Look, she didn't
know that Jack was in love with Grace

39:49.849 --> 39:51.649
and they weren't together yet,

39:51.684 --> 39:53.585
so let's not judge her, okay?

39:53.619 --> 39:55.999
She seemed nice enough
and I want to like her.

39:56.119 --> 39:57.066
How do you do it?

39:57.186 --> 39:59.858
How do you look at that girl
knowing what she did to our Grace,

39:59.892 --> 40:02.393
and see nothing but
unicorns and puppies?

40:02.428 --> 40:04.133
I'm tired of girls being
mean to girls, all right?

40:04.253 --> 40:05.463
All right, who's being mean?

40:05.498 --> 40:06.865
We're all being mean
to Clementine.

40:06.899 --> 40:09.501
Oh, come on.
Yeah, come on.

40:09.535 --> 40:10.668
Where's Omar tonight?

40:10.703 --> 40:15.707
Oh, uh, he introduced me
to his mother,

40:15.741 --> 40:18.543
so now I have to take
things really slowly

40:18.577 --> 40:20.778
because he is being really serious.
But that's great.

40:20.813 --> 40:24.886
I don't know. Might be the
right guy at the wrong time.

40:27.486 --> 40:28.486
(SIGHS)

40:29.488 --> 40:30.755
What's in these?

40:30.789 --> 40:33.658
Meat. Ground beef and pork,
some seasoning, bread crumbs.

40:33.692 --> 40:35.660
I got a game tomorrow.
I should be eating some carbs.

40:35.694 --> 40:37.428
Well, there's pasta.
It's still in the pan.

40:37.463 --> 40:39.364
We just never got around to serving it.
Help yourself.

40:39.398 --> 40:41.766
I think we're in for a long night.
I got curfew.

40:41.800 --> 40:43.434
Who are you playing tomorrow?

40:43.469 --> 40:44.836
A team we've
never beaten, so...

40:44.870 --> 40:46.704
Hmm. So.

40:46.739 --> 40:49.448
This might be a good time for
you to come out of the closet.

40:50.509 --> 40:51.709
(CHUCKLING)

40:52.711 --> 40:54.612
I know you're a Christian.

40:54.647 --> 40:57.583
Oh, man, maybe, but it's
just such a burden.

40:58.617 --> 41:00.518
I guess I should go now.

41:00.553 --> 41:02.854
Margaret's sitting out
in the driveway.

41:02.888 --> 41:04.722
You left her
sitting in the driveway?

41:04.757 --> 41:06.424
I owe her. She does it
to me all the time.

41:08.460 --> 41:11.396
So, I'm going to go.

41:11.430 --> 41:12.597
All right.

41:12.631 --> 41:14.524
Good night.
Good night.

41:17.570 --> 41:18.636
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

41:18.671 --> 41:20.838
Ew, you're going to kiss him?

41:20.873 --> 41:22.407
What is he doing here?

41:22.441 --> 41:23.708
What are you doing here?

41:23.742 --> 41:26.744
You invited us. Yeah, thanks
for the wrong address.

41:26.779 --> 41:28.546
Are you dyslexic
as well as pregnant?

41:28.847 --> 41:29.814
I'll go now.

41:31.850 --> 41:34.519
We got lost and it took
hours to convince my mom

41:34.553 --> 41:38.523
I wouldn't get pregnant just by
sleeping in the same room as you.

41:38.557 --> 41:40.278
You went to state
in the spelling bee?

41:40.593 --> 41:41.726
Y-E-S.

41:41.760 --> 41:43.595
Yeah, my mom saw it
on the Internet

41:43.629 --> 41:45.630
and a whole bunch
of other things.

41:45.664 --> 41:47.699
How can you be so smart
and get pregnant?

41:47.733 --> 41:49.667
Do you know what you're having?

41:49.702 --> 41:52.570
She's a girl, but I'm
letting a couple adopt her.

41:52.605 --> 41:55.573
Oh, I was adopted. Can I have this?
I'm starving.

41:55.608 --> 41:57.102
You're always starving.

41:59.411 --> 42:01.613
How was it, being adopted?

42:01.647 --> 42:03.848
I don't remember.
I was just a baby.

42:03.882 --> 42:06.384
But, you know,

42:06.418 --> 42:08.653
my mom and my dad have always
just been my mom and dad.

42:08.687 --> 42:11.389
I had these fantasies
that my birth mother

42:11.423 --> 42:13.591
was this big famous movie star,

42:13.626 --> 42:15.627
so my parents encouraged me
to meet her.

42:15.661 --> 42:17.695
She is not a big
famous movie star.

42:17.730 --> 42:22.600
She's this 45-year-old actress who had like
one line on a sitcom

42:22.635 --> 42:24.836
you never heard of 20 years ago
she never worked again.

42:24.870 --> 42:27.240
And she thought
I would get in her way.

42:27.773 --> 42:29.574
She still does.

42:29.608 --> 42:33.378
She posted a video of herself online.
Do you want to see her?

42:33.605 --> 42:34.445
I guess.

42:34.480 --> 42:37.036
I mean, this doesn't make you feel weird
or anything, does it?

42:37.156 --> 42:38.383
No.
Okay.

42:38.417 --> 42:39.717
(BEEPING)

42:39.752 --> 42:42.687
(VIDEO PLAYING)
(ALL LAUGHING)

42:45.424 --> 42:46.391
Oh!
