00:25.258 --> 00:29.422
It looks like heroin. It is
heroin. I've been tailing this guy.

00:30.530 --> 00:32.656
The Foundation cannot operate
above the law.

00:32.732 --> 00:36.293
I'm no longer working for the
Foundation, remember? I'm on suspension.

00:36.369 --> 00:40.237
I'm willing to pay you $50,000
for an hour's work.

00:42.442 --> 00:45.900
I don't do your bidding
anymore. I do my own.

00:46.346 --> 00:47.335
Don't.

00:47.647 --> 00:49.376
Back in the saddle.

00:49.449 --> 00:52.111
Butch and Sundance.
Rock 'n' roll.

00:54.087 --> 00:56.214
Michael. KITT. No!

01:02.062 --> 01:04.860
What do you want done?
Something dangerous.

01:04.931 --> 01:06.762
But I cannot aid
in anything...

01:06.833 --> 01:08.528
that could jeopardize
a human life.

01:12.072 --> 01:14.700
Michael, I can no longer
support your actions.

01:14.774 --> 01:17.868
KITT, we're about to hit three
feet of reinforced concrete wall.

01:17.944 --> 01:20.242
I'll abort
if you say you can't do it.

01:35.228 --> 01:37.560
Knight Rider,
a shadowy flight...

01:37.630 --> 01:39.894
into the dangerous world
of a man...

01:39.966 --> 01:42.093
who does not exist.

01:49.642 --> 01:51.974
Michael Knight,
a young loner...

01:52.045 --> 01:54.843
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent...

01:54.914 --> 01:57.109
the helpless, the powerless...

01:57.183 --> 02:00.414
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

03:19.165 --> 03:22.464
Devon, he went into the
Catfish Bar over an hour ago.

03:23.536 --> 03:25.731
Well,
maybe we're just wasting time.

03:25.805 --> 03:30.265
If you've got to waste time, Devon, there's
no better place to do it than in New Orleans.

03:30.343 --> 03:31.776
I'm sure you're right...

03:31.844 --> 03:36.076
but you've been tailing this Willis
character for almost 24 hours now...

03:36.149 --> 03:38.276
and all you've got to show
for it is a tour of the city.

03:38.418 --> 03:41.478
He likes to enjoy himself,
there's no question about that.

03:41.554 --> 03:43.613
Devon, if we're going to
put Lasalle out of business...

03:43.690 --> 03:46.921
we gotta squeeze his key
people. People like Willis.

03:47.460 --> 03:50.224
Yes.
Well, keep in touch, Michael.

03:50.296 --> 03:51.558
To tell you the truth...

03:51.631 --> 03:53.826
Michael, it's not the waiting
that bothers me.

03:53.900 --> 03:56.266
It's the Dixieland jazz
that goes with it.

03:56.336 --> 04:00.033
If I hear "When The Saints Go
Marching In" one more time...

04:00.173 --> 04:02.801
Wait a minute. There he is.

04:03.643 --> 04:06.544
Michael, he didn't have that
case when he went in.

04:06.613 --> 04:08.376
Got that right.

04:08.748 --> 04:11.239
Let's take
a little peek inside.

04:14.787 --> 04:18.916
A kilo of pure heroin, Michael.
Known on the street as China White.

04:18.992 --> 04:21.517
I didn't think Lasalle
was involved with drugs.

04:21.594 --> 04:23.960
Why not, pal?
He's into everything else.

04:28.534 --> 04:31.697
All right, he made us. Notify
Devon, then cut Willis off!

04:52.125 --> 04:53.183
Hey, watch it!

05:12.111 --> 05:14.739
Police officer! Get your hands
up against the wall!

05:14.814 --> 05:17.305
Legs spread.
Come on. Move it!

05:18.017 --> 05:19.712
That goes for you, too.

05:19.786 --> 05:21.811
Officer,
my name is Michael Knight.

05:21.888 --> 05:23.788
I work for The Foundation
for Law and Government.

05:25.224 --> 05:26.987
I said spread them.

05:33.733 --> 05:35.428
This yours?
It's his.

05:38.237 --> 05:42.833
Sergeant, it looks like heroin. It
is heroin. I've been tailing this guy.

05:45.912 --> 05:47.937
Been tailing something,
that's for sure.

05:48.014 --> 05:49.003
Suspension?

05:49.082 --> 05:52.210
I'm sorry, but until this mess is
straightened out, I have no choice.

05:52.285 --> 05:54.116
But, Devon, I was framed.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.917
He must have slipped the heroin in
my pocket while I was busting him.

05:56.989 --> 06:00.390
Please, Michael. I want to believe
you but I've got to have proof.

06:00.793 --> 06:04.354
And at this moment, the Foundation must
concentrate all its efforts on this key.

06:04.430 --> 06:07.456
Key? What is it with this key?
I'm being suspended here...

06:07.533 --> 06:09.660
and you're worried about a key
they found on Willis.

06:09.736 --> 06:11.169
Michael,
the police have requested...

06:11.237 --> 06:13.603
that I use all our resources
to discover exactly...

06:13.673 --> 06:15.538
what this key unlocks.

06:15.608 --> 06:18.406
If Lasalle has anything to do
with it, it's got to be important.

06:18.478 --> 06:21.276
Well, in case you've forgotten,
I'm one of those resources.

06:21.347 --> 06:23.338
Not under the present
circumstances.

06:23.783 --> 06:27.275
Michael, the Foundation has people to
answer to. It's a visible organization.

06:27.353 --> 06:30.516
If we let these charges against
you pass without investigation...

06:30.656 --> 06:32.783
it would be looked upon
as a cover-up.

06:32.859 --> 06:35.191
Devon, that's fine.
Investigate all you want...

06:35.261 --> 06:37.786
just don't keep me
from doing my job.

06:37.864 --> 06:40.856
I'm sorry, my decision is made.
Yeah, well, I got news for you.

06:40.933 --> 06:42.400
I've made a decision, too.

06:42.468 --> 06:45.096
I've been framed here, and there's
only one guy who could clear me.

06:45.171 --> 06:46.638
Willis is sticking
to his story.

06:46.706 --> 06:49.971
I'm not talking about Willis. I'm
talking about his boss, Lasalle.

06:50.143 --> 06:53.306
Michael, the Foundation cannot
operate above the law.

06:53.813 --> 06:57.510
I'm no longer working for the
Foundation, remember? I'm on suspension.

07:08.461 --> 07:09.553
Well, I'm glad...

07:09.629 --> 07:11.824
you got that little matter
straightened out.

07:12.832 --> 07:16.165
The only thing I got, pal,
was a suspension.

07:16.235 --> 07:18.897
A suspension?
But how can that be?

07:19.005 --> 07:22.907
Well, it's a long story and I
don't want to bore you with it.

07:23.309 --> 07:26.039
But I'm leaving.
Where are we going?

07:26.279 --> 07:28.747
We aren't going anywhere.
I'm going alone.

07:28.815 --> 07:31.375
Alone? But, Michael,
we're a team.

07:31.717 --> 07:34.982
Yeah. Yeah, I know. But you
belong to the Foundation.

07:35.054 --> 07:39.388
But, Michael, without you...
Yeah, I know. I feel the same way.

07:40.626 --> 07:43.891
Look, it's not over.
Not by a long shot.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.524
Until then...

07:51.437 --> 07:52.870
take care, huh?

08:38.049 --> 08:40.678
You again.
You're worse than a bad dream.

08:40.753 --> 08:43.313
All you gotta do is tell me
where I can find Lasalle...

08:43.389 --> 08:45.016
and I'll take my business
down the street.

08:45.091 --> 08:48.288
I told you before. I don't know
what Lasalle you're talking about.

08:48.361 --> 08:49.521
How many Lasalles...

08:49.595 --> 08:53.292
could own a big chunk of the French
Quarter, including this joint?

08:53.699 --> 08:55.132
Look, you want a drink or not?

08:56.302 --> 08:57.929
Sure he wants a drink.

09:01.207 --> 09:04.005
I don't think he's here
for the scenery.

09:06.279 --> 09:09.612
Give me a beer
and a zombie for Jane here.

09:10.983 --> 09:13.679
Just love a man
with a sense of humor.

09:13.753 --> 09:15.744
Make it a gin and tonic.

09:30.536 --> 09:32.333
Here's to a long friendship.

09:34.140 --> 09:35.971
To a long friendship.

09:36.609 --> 09:38.736
Even if it lasts all night.

09:43.849 --> 09:45.612
You know, Jane...

09:46.886 --> 09:49.650
I've kissed a few ladies
in my life.

09:49.989 --> 09:51.047
But you...

09:52.892 --> 09:56.123
Oh, really?
Could have fooled me.

09:57.997 --> 10:00.295
Why don't you tell me
all about it...

10:00.833 --> 10:02.425
lady by lady...

10:02.902 --> 10:04.392
kiss by kiss.

10:04.503 --> 10:08.166
No. I'm talking about you.
I mean... I mean...

10:16.782 --> 10:19.216
I don't think
I feel very good.

10:36.135 --> 10:38.126
I thought you were dead.

10:39.905 --> 10:41.634
Who says I'm not?

10:43.242 --> 10:44.504
If I didn't know better...

10:44.577 --> 10:46.875
I'd think somebody slipped
something in my drink last night.

10:46.946 --> 10:49.471
Now why would anyone
want to do that?

10:49.548 --> 10:50.981
You tell me.

10:51.050 --> 10:53.541
Boyd's waiting for you
out on the veranda.

10:56.822 --> 10:58.221
Ah.

10:58.457 --> 11:01.949
You must be Michael Knight.
How did you guess?

11:04.764 --> 11:07.790
I'm Boyd Lasalle,
and this is Linda.

11:08.367 --> 11:10.835
Oh, yes.
We almost met earlier.

11:14.140 --> 11:15.129
Darling.

11:16.809 --> 11:18.071
I know.

11:18.878 --> 11:20.243
Business.

11:29.422 --> 11:33.552
Now, I understand you've been
looking all over New Orleans for me.

11:34.060 --> 11:35.220
Why?

11:35.428 --> 11:38.454
Because one of your errand
boys framed me, that's why.

11:38.631 --> 11:39.859
Willis?

11:41.267 --> 11:42.996
So what do you want with me?

11:43.069 --> 11:47.768
I want my suspension lifted. I want my name
cleared and I want you to talk to Willis...

11:47.840 --> 11:49.865
and tell him
he made a very big mistake.

11:49.942 --> 11:52.001
But you and I
are natural enemies.

11:52.178 --> 11:55.238
As long as you're on suspension
I sleep better at night.

11:55.314 --> 11:57.475
But I'm not gonna be
on suspension forever.

11:57.550 --> 11:58.983
No, you're not.

11:59.385 --> 12:01.182
As a matter of fact...

12:01.253 --> 12:04.916
your status at the Foundation has
taken another turn for the worse.

12:06.225 --> 12:07.817
Well, what does that mean?

12:10.863 --> 12:13.491
Thanks to
my electronic wizard here...

12:13.599 --> 12:17.933
I've recently gained access to
the Foundation's inner sanctum.

12:20.773 --> 12:24.869
We actually use your surveillance
equipment to spy on you.

12:25.778 --> 12:27.040
Watch.

12:27.847 --> 12:29.007
But, Devon...

12:29.081 --> 12:30.412
It was the board's decision,
Bonnie...

12:30.483 --> 12:32.110
not mine.
But why?

12:32.184 --> 12:36.314
Well, the consensus was that
Michael was compromised. I'm sorry.

12:36.422 --> 12:39.550
I argued against it.
I did everything I could.

12:41.160 --> 12:44.391
Have you told him?
I'm trying to locate him now.

12:44.764 --> 12:47.096
Well, what are we going to do?
Do?

12:47.266 --> 12:49.666
We're going to replace him.

12:49.735 --> 12:52.761
Just like that?
We have no choice, Bonnie.

12:52.838 --> 12:54.396
Seen enough?

12:54.874 --> 12:57.900
I can imagine
how difficult this is for you.

12:57.977 --> 13:01.845
Fortunately, I think some good
can come out of it after all.

13:02.114 --> 13:04.105
I can't imagine what.

13:04.183 --> 13:07.675
I can use a man of your
talent. What do you think I am?

13:07.753 --> 13:10.415
For sale to the highest
bidder? No questions asked?

13:10.489 --> 13:12.150
You haven't heard
my offer yet.

13:12.224 --> 13:13.885
Save your breath.

13:14.093 --> 13:17.085
Then what are you gonna do
for a living?

13:17.763 --> 13:21.699
With your present security rating you
couldn't get a job as a rent-a-cop.

13:23.769 --> 13:27.830
I'm willing to pay you $50,000
for an hour's work.

13:38.050 --> 13:39.779
What kind of work?

13:39.852 --> 13:42.480
Stealing something
I want very much.

14:02.775 --> 14:07.769
No, Charles. Ski Mode is used
only in emergency situations.

14:08.147 --> 14:11.344
I'm just checking out
the equipment, little buddy.

14:11.417 --> 14:12.884
Little buddy?

14:13.018 --> 14:16.010
And, by the way,
you can call me Chuck.

14:16.288 --> 14:19.086
I can, yes,
but why would I want to?

14:19.558 --> 14:21.856
Well, if I'm going to be
your new partner...

14:21.927 --> 14:26.159
Unless I'm mistaken, Chuck, at this
point you're simply one of the many...

14:26.232 --> 14:28.632
candidates being considered
for the job.

14:28.701 --> 14:29.929
Well, that's true...

14:30.002 --> 14:32.835
but when Chuck Wallyburton
goes after something...

14:32.905 --> 14:34.702
he usually gets it.

14:34.773 --> 14:37.241
I see you and KITT are getting
to know each other, Charles.

14:37.309 --> 14:39.504
You can call him Chuck, Devon.

14:39.578 --> 14:41.910
Oh, we're getting along
just fine.

14:41.981 --> 14:46.008
I must say, this is some
organization you run, Dev.

14:46.452 --> 14:51.014
Just give me the right word and
it's goodbye Feds, hello Foundation.

14:51.090 --> 14:52.318
Yeah.

14:52.391 --> 14:54.951
Well, you realize, of course,
that we are still in the process...

14:55.027 --> 14:57.188
of interviewing
possible replacements.

14:57.263 --> 15:00.699
Well, like I always say,
why shop for ground round...

15:00.766 --> 15:03.667
when you've got top sirloin
right on your plate?

15:03.936 --> 15:06.564
That's what you always say,
is it?

15:06.805 --> 15:09.365
And what does
this little button do?

15:09.441 --> 15:10.601
"Eject left."

15:10.843 --> 15:12.936
Why don't you check it out,
Chuck?

15:13.012 --> 15:15.606
Now you're talking,
little buddy.

15:21.654 --> 15:22.916
I didn't see that, KITT.

15:43.842 --> 15:46.003
Danton's ready to take you
to the plane now.

15:51.317 --> 15:53.251
What if I'm not ready
to be taken?

15:55.554 --> 15:58.250
Are you asking a question or
are you just making conversation?

15:58.324 --> 15:59.916
Maybe a little bit of both.

16:00.392 --> 16:01.859
Is that allowed?

16:03.062 --> 16:04.529
If it makes you feel better.

16:04.596 --> 16:06.689
Hey, what is it with you,
anyway?

16:06.765 --> 16:09.461
Do you have contempt for
everybody, or am I just special?

16:41.200 --> 16:43.168
Hi, buddy, miss me?

16:43.235 --> 16:45.430
Michael! I thought
I'd never see you again!

16:46.472 --> 16:49.600
Well, you can't get rid of me that
easy, pal. You've talked with Devon.

16:49.675 --> 16:52.906
It was a misunderstanding.
Everything will be the way it was.

16:52.978 --> 16:55.412
No, pal, I'm afraid
it'll never be the way it was.

16:55.481 --> 16:56.709
Then why did you come back?

16:56.782 --> 16:59.114
To get you.
I don't understand.

16:59.318 --> 17:03.152
Come on, KITT. You said it
yourself. We're partners.

17:03.222 --> 17:05.554
Michael,
this is all very confusing.

17:05.691 --> 17:08.125
We got places to go
and things to do.

17:08.193 --> 17:11.890
I'm the property of The
Foundation for Law and Government.

17:12.097 --> 17:14.827
Come on, pal.
Open the door. Let me in.

17:16.769 --> 17:20.000
This is the last time.
I won't ask again.

17:26.045 --> 17:29.572
All right, back in the saddle.

17:29.681 --> 17:32.377
Butch and Sundance.
Rock 'n' roll.

17:34.486 --> 17:36.852
Michael. KITT. No!

17:41.393 --> 17:43.588
Come on, admit it.
It feels great.

17:43.796 --> 17:46.196
There is
an undeniable nostalgia.

17:46.265 --> 17:49.029
Unfortunately, it's clouded
by your recent behavior.

17:49.101 --> 17:53.561
My recent behavior is history.
We have a whole life ahead of us.

17:53.639 --> 17:55.937
As fugitives, it would seem.

19:03.342 --> 19:04.934
Michael Knight.

19:05.310 --> 19:08.370
I don't see your name
on the guest list, Mr. Knight.

19:08.447 --> 19:11.473
Are you here for the birthday
party? What birthday party?

19:11.550 --> 19:14.314
I work for Lasalle.
Please wait here.

19:16.688 --> 19:19.282
I got a guy out here.
A Michael Knight?

19:20.792 --> 19:22.589
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

19:22.661 --> 19:26.097
Michael... Shall we?
Just for old time's sake?

19:26.698 --> 19:28.928
Michael,
it is good to have you back.

19:30.502 --> 19:31.491
Hey!

19:58.030 --> 20:01.625
Our new business associate
who favors dramatic entrances.

20:02.134 --> 20:04.694
Congratulations.
As agreed.

20:06.305 --> 20:08.637
Maybe you shouldn't park
on the grass, huh?

20:08.707 --> 20:10.868
Don't worry.
I'll find a place for myself.

20:18.350 --> 20:20.250
As agreed, yes.

20:20.619 --> 20:22.246
But considering
we live in a time...

20:22.321 --> 20:25.290
when agreements are broken as
often as honored, I'm impressed.

20:25.357 --> 20:27.951
The price was right.
Is that a hint?

20:28.026 --> 20:30.722
No, I'd like my money.
Follow me.

20:46.745 --> 20:48.076
Oh, my.

20:51.116 --> 20:52.140
Scat.

20:52.351 --> 20:53.477
Skedaddle.

21:01.493 --> 21:02.687
Bug off.

21:02.761 --> 21:06.128
I support endangered species,
but this is ridiculous.

21:16.141 --> 21:17.631
Not again!

21:19.144 --> 21:21.169
This calls
for extreme measures.

21:28.987 --> 21:31.148
Thank goodness.

21:34.726 --> 21:36.193
Thanks.

21:37.195 --> 21:38.457
That's all?

21:39.431 --> 21:42.628
I forget something?
Let's not play games.

21:43.435 --> 21:47.963
Without you, the car is virtually
useless. You know that and I know that.

21:48.040 --> 21:50.133
It's a means to an end.

21:50.876 --> 21:52.969
What will it cost me?

21:53.045 --> 21:55.946
What do you want done?
Something dangerous.

21:56.014 --> 21:57.106
I figured.

21:58.884 --> 22:00.977
I need you right away.

22:01.453 --> 22:03.921
Excuse me.
I won't be a minute.

22:38.990 --> 22:42.323
No! You promised!
No! Wait! No!

22:42.394 --> 22:43.452
Go ahead.

22:51.336 --> 22:53.827
No, you promised!

23:22.868 --> 23:24.802
He'll see you now.

23:38.250 --> 23:39.717
Now I'm impressed.

23:40.218 --> 23:41.207
Thank you.

23:41.920 --> 23:43.649
Shall we get down to business?

23:43.722 --> 23:45.553
I've already gotten down
to mine.

23:46.358 --> 23:50.055
That's nothing. Six months
if you're not too extravagant.

23:50.595 --> 23:52.620
I'm prepared to make you
a wealthy man.

23:53.165 --> 23:54.564
Could you be more specific?

23:54.699 --> 23:56.326
Five times that.

23:56.401 --> 23:58.961
$250,000 cash.

23:59.471 --> 24:01.336
Who do you want me to kill?

24:04.309 --> 24:05.901
That was a joke.

24:07.012 --> 24:10.846
What you see here is state-of-the-art
in digital communications.

24:11.483 --> 24:15.544
With it, I can detect and monitor any
electronic transmission in the world.

24:18.356 --> 24:20.290
A treasure hunt
off the coast of Haiti.

24:20.358 --> 24:22.656
If they find the treasure,
we're gonna rip them off, too.

24:25.730 --> 24:26.822
Now...

24:27.699 --> 24:31.032
tell me what you know about
the Bohr-Fellows Lock?

24:31.636 --> 24:34.571
It's the most impregnable
lock ever designed.

24:34.673 --> 24:38.268
Titanium alloy tumblers,
a coded magnetic key...

24:38.343 --> 24:40.971
that's next to impossible
to duplicate.

24:41.046 --> 24:42.377
Excellent.

24:42.647 --> 24:45.673
And I was this close
to getting my hands on one...

24:45.750 --> 24:48.810
until Willis decided to
moonlight a drug deal on his own.

24:48.887 --> 24:50.411
And the rest is history.

24:50.589 --> 24:52.989
History I intend to rewrite.

24:53.625 --> 24:57.288
I want that key back, Michael.
And we both know who has it.

24:58.163 --> 24:59.391
Danton.

26:14.239 --> 26:17.333
Michael!
What are you doing here?

26:17.676 --> 26:20.236
It turns out we have some
unfinished business, Devon.

26:20.345 --> 26:23.439
The only unfinished business
we have is the theft of KITT.

26:23.515 --> 26:26.348
That, and breaking into my
office. I demand an explanation.

26:26.518 --> 26:28.509
Sorry, but your demanding days
are over.

26:28.587 --> 26:31.988
I don't do your bidding
anymore. I do my own.

26:32.757 --> 26:34.725
Don't step on the alarm.

26:36.728 --> 26:38.559
I can't believe this.

26:39.464 --> 26:42.399
Michael, for God's sake,
stop this insanity...

26:42.467 --> 26:44.492
before you do something
that you will really regret.

26:44.569 --> 26:48.096
Save the moral indignation. I've
had enough to last a lifetime.

26:49.174 --> 26:50.698
Open the safe.

26:51.109 --> 26:52.167
Why?

26:54.379 --> 26:55.607
Open it.

27:10.028 --> 27:12.496
What do you want? Money?
The key.

27:12.731 --> 27:15.063
What key?
Don't press your luck.

27:15.133 --> 27:17.966
The key they found on Willis.
Now, open it!

27:21.840 --> 27:25.105
Michael, listen to me...
Devon, the key. Right now!

27:48.233 --> 27:51.896
Well, gentlemen.
Phase two is complete.

28:47.492 --> 28:49.687
If you don't mind,
I think I'll turn in.

28:49.761 --> 28:51.353
It's been a long day.

28:51.563 --> 28:52.928
Good idea.

28:53.198 --> 28:55.928
We complete the third
and final phase tomorrow.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.059
Be ready to leave at 7 a.m.

28:58.369 --> 29:01.395
You mind telling me what
the third and final phase is?

29:01.473 --> 29:04.533
From now on, information will
be on a need-to-know basis.

29:04.943 --> 29:08.709
I need to know.
You do, but not tonight.

29:10.715 --> 29:12.706
Was it difficult for you?
What?

29:12.984 --> 29:14.645
Dealing with Devon Miles.

29:17.889 --> 29:20.881
Yeah. Yeah, it was.

29:22.560 --> 29:23.754
But I did it.

29:56.394 --> 29:57.520
Psst.

29:58.062 --> 30:01.498
Don't say anything. You're on
their surveillance system.

30:01.966 --> 30:03.661
I have to talk to you.

30:04.936 --> 30:07.234
Somebody left something
in my bedroom.

30:07.972 --> 30:09.872
If it was you, show me.

30:09.941 --> 30:12.239
Give me some kind of sign
to let me know.

30:15.513 --> 30:18.004
KITT, I want you to knock out
the system monitor in my room.

30:22.120 --> 30:24.884
Michael, this is a very
sophisticated operation.

30:25.156 --> 30:28.523
The old saying "easier said
than done" comes to mind.

30:29.027 --> 30:31.188
Buzz me twice when it's okay.

30:43.875 --> 30:45.308
All right, it's safe.

30:45.376 --> 30:46.502
Are you sure?

30:46.678 --> 30:47.804
Yeah. Come on.

30:54.919 --> 30:58.855
All right, I want to believe you, but
right now I can't take any chances.

30:59.224 --> 31:01.055
What was it
you left in my room?

31:01.159 --> 31:04.219
A birthday card with something
inside. What was inside?

31:05.163 --> 31:06.289
This.

31:23.948 --> 31:27.611
You better get down here,
genius. All I can see is soccer.

31:27.919 --> 31:31.480
Yeah, you know, soccer. Where
you hit the ball with your head.

31:32.624 --> 31:33.921
Yeah, hurry it up.

31:44.435 --> 31:45.697
Just who are you?

31:48.673 --> 31:50.732
I'm someone you can trust.

31:51.142 --> 31:52.939
That doesn't tell me
who you are.

31:53.011 --> 31:55.479
If you can trust me,
it doesn't matter who I am.

31:55.780 --> 31:56.872
Now, I'd like to trust you...

31:56.948 --> 31:59.416
if only you hadn't put what you
did in my drink the other night.

32:00.151 --> 32:01.277
Boyd told me to do that.

32:01.352 --> 32:04.253
Oh, and you do everything Boyd tells
you to do, like a good little girl?

32:04.322 --> 32:07.814
You don't refuse Boyd.
He's sick.

32:08.693 --> 32:11.491
You know that, don't you?
Well, I didn't.

32:13.932 --> 32:16.059
When I met him, I thought...

32:18.703 --> 32:22.537
I thought he was wonderful.
I thought he was different.

32:22.607 --> 32:24.768
I thought he was a savior.

32:29.113 --> 32:33.015
I guess if you go looking for saviors, you're
gonna see one whether he's there or not.

32:33.885 --> 32:36.786
Who was the little girl?
Your daughter?

32:39.090 --> 32:40.250
Mary Beth.

32:44.562 --> 32:46.757
Mary Beth was three
when I met Boyd.

32:48.333 --> 32:52.133
I was working down on one of
his clubs on Bourbon Street.

32:52.270 --> 32:55.637
I was doing everything that I could
to support the two of us, and...

32:59.043 --> 33:01.136
Well, then along comes Boyd...

33:02.814 --> 33:05.681
and promises that if I would
just move in with him...

33:05.750 --> 33:07.479
that he would take care
of everything, and...

33:08.619 --> 33:11.611
Okay, I know that I shouldn't have,
and I know that I should've said no...

33:11.689 --> 33:12.917
and I wanted to, but...

33:16.627 --> 33:17.924
I didn't.

33:20.264 --> 33:21.822
Anyway, when...

33:25.069 --> 33:27.833
I tried to leave,
it was too late.

33:28.840 --> 33:29.898
All right.

33:31.109 --> 33:32.770
What happened
at the limousine?

33:35.980 --> 33:38.505
He promised me I could see her
for my birthday.

33:40.385 --> 33:44.549
And then when she came, I found out that
he'd told them no more than 10 minutes.

33:45.089 --> 33:47.284
He thought it might be
too upsetting for me.

33:47.792 --> 33:49.760
I guess I got a little crazy,
I don't know.

33:50.395 --> 33:52.420
So to make sure
that you never leave him...

33:52.497 --> 33:53.930
he's keeping your daughter
prisoner?

33:54.866 --> 33:55.992
Do you know where?

33:57.468 --> 34:01.234
He would never tell me.
Someplace outside of town.

34:01.372 --> 34:03.533
Maybe I can trace it through
the limousine's license.

34:04.742 --> 34:06.767
Yeah, what is it, pal?
They're working on the system.

34:06.844 --> 34:10.143
I can't hold the override more
than another 10 or 15 seconds.

34:10.415 --> 34:12.315
I got you.
What was that?

34:12.382 --> 34:13.748
It's just a friend. Come on.

34:39.976 --> 34:42.377
Good luck.
Yeah.

34:44.681 --> 34:47.549
You know, I'd sure feel a lot
better if I knew where I was going...

34:47.618 --> 34:49.415
and exactly
what I'm supposed to do.

34:49.487 --> 34:51.478
When the time is right,
you'll know.

35:13.811 --> 35:15.745
Well, Butch, where now?

35:16.080 --> 35:17.479
Shall we make a run
for the border?

35:17.548 --> 35:20.915
KITT, I meant that as an example
of partnership, of friendship.

35:20.985 --> 35:22.111
We are not outlaws.

35:22.520 --> 35:26.286
What would you call us? Models
of civic responsibility?

35:27.458 --> 35:29.756
I wouldn't go that far.
I thought not.

35:29.827 --> 35:33.923
In fact, how very odd. Someone's trying
to penetrate my voice transmission.

35:33.998 --> 35:36.831
All right, let's check it out.
I can't. I'm being overridden.

35:36.901 --> 35:38.129
I can't.

35:38.202 --> 35:40.227
Michael, can you hear me?

35:41.239 --> 35:43.002
Lasalle?
Listen carefully.

35:43.608 --> 35:48.068
You are 15.3 miles from Fire
Mountain Chemical Facility.

35:48.679 --> 35:50.374
After penetrating security...

35:50.448 --> 35:54.145
proceed to Delta Level
refrigerated storage vault...

35:54.318 --> 35:58.254
which can be opened
by punching the code 3280.

35:58.890 --> 36:03.190
There, inside the Bohr-Fellows wall
depository, you'll find our target object.

36:04.028 --> 36:06.826
A canister
of trihydrosulfate-g.

36:07.498 --> 36:10.433
You'll receive additional
instructions when needed.

36:10.768 --> 36:12.827
How dare
that person override me?

36:13.070 --> 36:16.005
KITT, what's trihydrosulfate-g?
Coming right up.

36:16.340 --> 36:17.864
Trihydrosulfate-g...

36:17.942 --> 36:21.241
is an experimental
genetically-engineered amino acid...

36:21.879 --> 36:24.814
being tested
as a bacteriological agent.

36:24.882 --> 36:29.148
It is quantumly more powerful than
anything that is presently in use.

36:30.021 --> 36:32.683
Biological warfare?
To say the least.

36:32.757 --> 36:35.692
If one liter were accidentally
released into the atmosphere...

36:35.760 --> 36:39.059
no living organism within 1,000
square miles would survive.

36:39.130 --> 36:41.564
KITT, get me a site map
of the Fire Mountain facility.

36:42.567 --> 36:43.659
KITT?

36:43.734 --> 36:48.569
Michael, given the severity of the situation,
I can no longer support your actions.

36:48.639 --> 36:52.666
I'll manual override. What you
do is sadly beyond my control.

36:53.077 --> 36:56.706
But I cannot and will not aid in anything
that could jeopardize a human life.

36:57.215 --> 36:58.682
Last chance.

37:20.638 --> 37:23.698
Someone just busted through the
north fence. Get on over here.

37:34.218 --> 37:37.415
KITT, we're about to hit three
feet of reinforced concrete wall.

37:37.488 --> 37:39.786
I'll abort if you say
you can't do it.

38:20.731 --> 38:22.358
It's about time.

38:33.044 --> 38:34.739
Hello, Michael.
Hello, Devon.

38:34.812 --> 38:36.279
I am glad to see you.
Me, too.

38:36.347 --> 38:38.508
I see you've also discovered
what the key unlocks, huh?

38:38.582 --> 38:42.143
Only a short time ago. He's
after the trihydrosulfate-g.

38:42.219 --> 38:43.982
Any idea
what he wants with it?

38:44.055 --> 38:47.024
10-to-1,
sell it to the highest bidder.

38:48.426 --> 38:51.122
Look, why can't we just fill this
thing with shaving cream, huh?

38:51.195 --> 38:52.423
Be a lot safer.

38:52.496 --> 38:56.125
I know what you're thinking, Michael.
What if Lasalle outsmarts us...

38:56.200 --> 38:58.168
and gets clear away?
Yeah.

38:58.235 --> 39:00.100
Unfortunately,
we have no choice.

39:00.171 --> 39:02.139
Lasalle wouldn't even
get 30 days...

39:02.206 --> 39:04.970
for masterminding the theft
of a can of shaving cream.

39:05.042 --> 39:07.772
But once the trihydrosulfate-g
is in his possession...

39:07.912 --> 39:09.709
we'll have him
right where we want him.

39:09.780 --> 39:13.546
All right, you just make sure you get
the authorities there to arrest him.

39:13.651 --> 39:16.916
We'll track your destination by
monitoring KITT's homing signal.

39:20.958 --> 39:22.016
You take the labs.

39:22.093 --> 39:23.890
We'll check out the cold
storage vault. Come on.

39:23.961 --> 39:25.223
Go! Get out of here.

39:25.796 --> 39:28.026
And for heaven's sake,
be careful with that.

39:28.466 --> 39:29.694
Piece of cake!

39:29.767 --> 39:31.496
Good luck, Michael.

39:36.607 --> 39:38.973
Come on, buddy.
It's no time to hold a grudge!

39:39.643 --> 39:41.634
Thanks.
We'll talk about it later.

39:41.712 --> 39:43.236
No! Don't move!

40:17.681 --> 40:19.444
Well done, Michael.

40:19.750 --> 40:23.584
Yeah. Now, where do I
get rid of this thing?

40:23.921 --> 40:26.515
I can imagine
you might be a little nervous.

40:26.590 --> 40:30.549
Continue on I-10 for another 30
minutes at your present speed.

40:30.628 --> 40:33.358
You got it.
You heard the man, KITT.

40:39.837 --> 40:41.600
Ready for our little trip?

40:41.672 --> 40:44.232
Boyd, where are we going?
What about Mary Beth?

40:44.308 --> 40:47.277
Can't she come with us, please? She
won't be any trouble, I promise you.

40:47.344 --> 40:50.802
It's not Mary Beth I'm worried
about. It's you, Linda.

40:51.182 --> 40:52.706
You and Michael Knight.

40:52.783 --> 40:55.650
And your little rendezvous
behind my back.

40:57.188 --> 40:59.179
The chopper's ready, sir.

40:59.256 --> 41:02.692
Then let's get started.
No, I won't go.

41:03.294 --> 41:06.354
Boyd, don't make me
come, please. Danton.

41:37.828 --> 41:39.955
Michael, Boyd.

41:40.965 --> 41:42.489
I hear you.

41:42.566 --> 41:44.898
You should be approaching
Laffite Crossing.

41:44.969 --> 41:48.598
Turn off there, then take a
left onto the old River Road.

41:48.672 --> 41:51.869
Follow it to the end.
You're the boss.

41:52.409 --> 41:54.934
And just to be sure you don't
forget that, Michael...

41:55.012 --> 41:59.813
Linda and her daughter.

42:01.218 --> 42:02.583
What does that mean?

42:02.653 --> 42:05.588
Call it the paranoia
of a suspicious mind.

42:05.723 --> 42:10.490
But if anything goes wrong, if for
some reason I don't get that canister...

42:10.928 --> 42:12.987
Linda and her daughter
will die.

42:15.232 --> 42:17.666
Well, she's your girlfriend,
not mine.

42:17.735 --> 42:20.226
What do I care
what happens to her?

42:20.804 --> 42:23.932
Somehow, Michael,
I don't believe you mean that.

42:24.375 --> 42:28.607
That's why I'm sure you won't let
anything go wrong. Anything at all.

42:35.352 --> 42:36.979
You call this a road?

42:37.288 --> 42:39.882
Even an alligator would have
a hard time around here.

42:39.957 --> 42:42.221
Sorry, KITT.

42:44.695 --> 42:46.128
Well, what do you know?

42:46.664 --> 42:49.132
I think it's time we had
a little heart-to-heart.

42:49.266 --> 42:52.497
I got a feeling I'm gonna need
all the help I can get.

42:55.239 --> 42:58.436
KITT, I wasn't suspended
from the Foundation.

42:59.043 --> 43:01.341
Devon and I
planned the whole thing...

43:01.412 --> 43:04.279
to infiltrate Lasalle's
operation and put him away.

43:04.348 --> 43:06.612
What about the heroin the
police found in your jacket?

43:06.684 --> 43:09.585
I put it there myself.
It's all part of the plan.

43:09.653 --> 43:11.211
But why didn't you
let me in on it?

43:11.288 --> 43:13.586
We were afraid Lasalle might
have been tapped in to you, too.

43:13.657 --> 43:15.625
I couldn't tell anyone, pal.
Not even Bonnie.

43:15.893 --> 43:18.623
Michael, I recall you
turned off my homing signal.

43:18.696 --> 43:22.393
I truly hope part of your plan wasn't
to have Devon monitor our position.

43:22.800 --> 43:24.529
Well, it was, KITT...

43:25.035 --> 43:29.768
but after what Lasalle said, I couldn't
risk Linda and her daughter's life.

43:29.840 --> 43:31.102
No, of course you couldn't.

43:31.175 --> 43:33.541
We partners again?
Butch and Sundance.

43:33.877 --> 43:35.970
Butch and Sundance.

43:52.296 --> 43:54.730
There's not much time.
Hand it over.

43:56.233 --> 43:59.168
On one condition.
What's that?

43:59.236 --> 44:03.104
You let Linda go.
You ask too much.

44:03.173 --> 44:05.368
I got the ace in the hole.

44:05.943 --> 44:08.878
I could kill you now and
just take it away from you.

44:08.979 --> 44:11.140
Then I might as well just open
this thing up right now.

44:11.215 --> 44:12.512
No! Wait!

44:17.021 --> 44:20.752
You have a deal.
Get in the car.

44:21.692 --> 44:22.886
But what about you?

44:22.960 --> 44:24.985
I can take care of myself.
Now get her out of here!

44:27.631 --> 44:28.996
Where are you going?

44:29.166 --> 44:31.327
No one said nothing about
poison gas and a talking car.

44:32.536 --> 44:34.663
Sure is hard
to get good help these days.

44:35.673 --> 44:39.040
The canister.
It's all yours.

44:43.313 --> 44:44.473
Kill him!

44:45.683 --> 44:47.810
That's the old teamwork, pal.

44:48.786 --> 44:50.048
Come on!

44:55.492 --> 44:57.153
Michael, they're getting away.

44:58.128 --> 45:01.757
All right, microwave jam that
chopper and bring it down.

45:13.177 --> 45:14.906
It's working, KITT.
Keep jamming him.

45:18.782 --> 45:20.511
Pull up. Pull up!

45:20.584 --> 45:21.983
I can't. I can't.

45:26.356 --> 45:28.017
More power, KITT.

45:32.529 --> 45:33.962
Stay with it, buddy.

46:11.769 --> 46:15.261
I'll take this. You won't need
this where you're going.

46:24.848 --> 46:26.213
Are your things packed?

46:26.283 --> 46:27.375
Mmm-hmm.

46:27.451 --> 46:31.581
And by tonight, all of this will be
nothing but a very bad dream, thanks to you.

46:31.655 --> 46:33.418
I could not have done it
by myself.

46:33.957 --> 46:35.982
And I hope you remember that,
Michael.

46:36.059 --> 46:40.723
KITT, I promise you, I will never
keep anything from you ever again.

46:41.431 --> 46:43.490
Well, I certainly hope not.

46:44.568 --> 46:45.865
Michael.

47:02.052 --> 47:05.146
Mommy. Mommy!
Mary Beth!

47:06.156 --> 47:08.556
We're never going to be
away from each other again.

47:08.692 --> 47:10.091
Not ever, ever.

47:10.294 --> 47:12.785
Let me look at you.
Oh, baby...

47:14.198 --> 47:16.530
Thanks for finding her.
My pleasure.

47:16.700 --> 47:19.828
And I even forgive you for not
letting me in on your little secret.

47:19.903 --> 47:22.804
Devon told me KITT might have sensed
I was keeping something from him.

47:22.873 --> 47:23.999
Where is Devon anyway?

47:24.074 --> 47:25.939
He's helping the authorities
prepare their case...

47:26.009 --> 47:28.409
against Lasalle, Danton, and all
the others who worked for him.

47:29.847 --> 47:31.872
Oh, no! Not again.

47:34.685 --> 47:37.347
What's the matter, buddy?
Alligator just wants to be friendly.

47:37.487 --> 47:40.945
Michael, it's not the alligator
I'm worried about. Look!

47:47.631 --> 47:52.159
I forgot to tell you. Chuck Wallyburton.
Handling the case for the Feds.

47:54.538 --> 47:57.996
Hey, little buddy,
look who's here!

47:59.009 --> 48:01.842
Given a choice,
I prefer alligators.
