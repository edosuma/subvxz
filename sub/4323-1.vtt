10:34.175 --> 10:35.926
Isn't that amazing
how he can talk

10:36.011 --> 10:37.803
and suck my cock at
the same exact time?

10:37.971 --> 10:39.805
Yes, it is.
Incredible.
(LAUGHING)

10:40.348 --> 10:43.100
Oh, clean yourself up.

10:43.184 --> 10:44.727
Should have closed
your eyes, Julie.

10:45.061 --> 10:47.855
I know your vulgarity
masks your pain.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.440
No, it doesn't.

10:49.524 --> 10:51.775
I was trying to remember
the last time we had

10:51.860 --> 10:54.695
one of these wonderful
evenings for you, sir.

10:54.946 --> 10:57.031
Surely there
must have been one

10:57.198 --> 11:01.368
somewhere in the history
of this kingdom,
of your illustrious life.

11:01.453 --> 11:03.996
There must've
been some moment

11:04.205 --> 11:05.789
that we can
all remember.

11:05.874 --> 11:07.833
And I'm trying
to think now

11:08.543 --> 11:10.169
and there's nothing.

11:10.962 --> 11:14.256
Courtney, I think
I've had enough
of this foul party.

11:14.340 --> 11:15.340
Yes, sir.

11:15.425 --> 11:16.759
(JULIE LAUGHS MOCKINGLY)

11:18.511 --> 11:20.387
THADEOUS: Stupid Julie,
I'll show him.

11:21.556 --> 11:23.390
I am Thadeous,

11:23.558 --> 11:27.144
the greatest
sword fighting man
to ever live.

11:27.312 --> 11:32.024
I will murder anyone
whoever tries
to insult me

11:32.108 --> 11:34.234
or challenge me.
(SQUAWKING)

11:34.778 --> 11:37.988
Some balls you have, Simon,
showing yourself to me.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.907
(CHITTERING)

11:40.116 --> 11:42.159
No matter what you say,
we'll never be friends

11:42.243 --> 11:44.578
because I hate
mechanical inventions

11:44.746 --> 11:46.038
and you know this.

11:46.122 --> 11:47.331
(CHITTERING)

11:47.415 --> 11:49.541
Wipe that smile
off your face.

11:50.752 --> 11:52.336
Hey, Simon.

11:52.504 --> 11:55.672
You should swing
from your hips, Brother.
You'll get more leverage.

11:55.757 --> 11:57.841
Here, let me show you.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.009
Oh, god.

11:59.094 --> 12:01.762
Put your hands there,
yeah,

12:01.930 --> 12:04.056
and swing.

12:04.224 --> 12:07.434
Gods, get off of me.
I know how
to use a sword.

12:07.602 --> 12:09.436
Do you?
Yes.

12:09.604 --> 12:11.605
We'll see about that.

12:11.773 --> 12:13.524
Okay, enough.
I don't want to do
swords with you.

12:13.608 --> 12:14.691
I'm doing it by myself.

12:14.776 --> 12:16.193
Defend yourself,
Brother!

12:16.277 --> 12:17.694
Stop it.
There you go.

12:17.779 --> 12:18.779
Stop.

12:18.863 --> 12:20.364
Defend yourself!

12:20.532 --> 12:22.533
(FABIOUS EXCLAIMING)
Stop it.

12:23.827 --> 12:24.868
Oh, shit!

12:24.953 --> 12:26.787
You just nicked
my knuckles!

12:26.871 --> 12:29.706
Oh, you'll be all right.
It's not as if I cut
your head off or anything.

12:29.958 --> 12:32.042
Why would you bring
that disgusting thing here?

12:32.210 --> 12:34.294
It's getting juices
in our water supply.

12:34.462 --> 12:36.130
It's a souvenir
of my kill.

12:36.381 --> 12:39.133
I always take one
from a foe that's
tasted the cold,

12:39.217 --> 12:41.468
unrelenting steel
of my blade.

12:41.928 --> 12:43.846
Souvenir of your kill?

12:43.930 --> 12:47.808
That sounds like
a rather stupid,
bloodthirsty tradition.

12:49.310 --> 12:50.686
What's your problem?

12:50.770 --> 12:52.229
Why are you
such a sourpuss?

12:52.313 --> 12:55.816
I'm not being a sourpuss.
I just didn't wanna be
at that celebrations.

12:56.151 --> 12:58.360
All I want is for you
to be a part
of this moment.

12:58.528 --> 13:01.071
I want you to be gay
with me and father.

13:01.156 --> 13:03.282
I don't want to be gay
with you two.

13:03.408 --> 13:04.449
(SIGHS)

13:04.534 --> 13:05.701
I'd rather just stay
in here

13:05.785 --> 13:08.203
with my blade
and fuck things up.

13:08.496 --> 13:09.705
Why would you say that?

13:09.789 --> 13:12.291
Because, Fabious,
it's true.

13:13.877 --> 13:15.210
(GRUNTING)

13:15.920 --> 13:18.964
I'm sick and tired
of everyone sucking up
on your tits

13:19.048 --> 13:21.008
because you are
to become king.

13:21.175 --> 13:24.469
All the while, no one gives
two turtle shits about me.

13:24.804 --> 13:29.224
But Thaddy,
first borns like me,
we become king.

13:29.309 --> 13:32.644
Second borns, you can be
whatever you want to be.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.646
I want to be king.

13:35.565 --> 13:37.107
Maybe we can both
be king.

13:37.317 --> 13:40.819
No, I want to be
king by myself.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.863
Well, cheer up,
Brother.

13:42.947 --> 13:44.364
I have something else
that you can be.

13:44.866 --> 13:46.450
What?

13:46.534 --> 13:48.201
Best man
at my wedding.

13:48.703 --> 13:51.747
I can think
of no one else
I'd want by my side

13:52.123 --> 13:54.791
as I sing
my vow passionately
into her eyes.

13:54.876 --> 13:57.252
Sounds tedious
and boring.

13:57.545 --> 13:59.171
If I'm not mistaken,
it's tradition

13:59.255 --> 14:02.174
that the best man gets
to finger the bridesmaids.

14:02.258 --> 14:05.052
Really?
I've never heard
of this tradition.

14:05.720 --> 14:06.929
(SNIFFS)

14:09.641 --> 14:11.141
You have a fucking deal.

14:11.225 --> 14:13.477
Oh, you're gonna
be so handsome!

14:13.561 --> 14:16.271
Who's gonna be
the most handsome
best man?

14:16.856 --> 14:18.065
Probably me.

14:18.149 --> 14:21.151
Who's the prince
with the most
dashing moustache?

14:21.736 --> 14:22.861
Me.

14:22.946 --> 14:25.238
Who gives
the warmest hugs?

14:25.323 --> 14:26.698
Me, of course.

14:27.325 --> 14:28.867
I love you, Thadeous.

14:30.453 --> 14:32.579
Okay, that's cool.

14:33.539 --> 14:36.875
MALE ANNOUNCER: All gather
for the royal wedding!

14:36.960 --> 14:38.543
(ALL CHATTERING)

14:50.598 --> 14:53.266
Hello there, best man.

14:53.685 --> 14:54.685
Best man?

14:54.769 --> 14:57.688
If he wanted a best man,
he should have chosen me.

14:57.772 --> 14:59.815
How many quests
have I been on
with Fabious?

14:59.899 --> 15:00.899
Countless.
Mmm.

15:01.693 --> 15:04.945
I gave my hand
to save his life
on the battlefield.

15:05.029 --> 15:07.948
And yet
he chooses Thadeous
as his best man.

15:08.157 --> 15:11.660
That sorry sack of shit.

15:11.828 --> 15:14.621
Such a poor excuse
for a prince.

15:14.789 --> 15:18.375
He's nothing more
than a self-entitled,
rotten child!

15:18.710 --> 15:19.710
MANIOUS: Idiot.

15:21.963 --> 15:23.839
You look beautiful.
Thank you.

15:24.007 --> 15:25.007
FABIOUS: Belladonna...

15:25.758 --> 15:27.759
Oh, my love.

15:30.763 --> 15:34.099
Oh, Fabious, I can't wait
until the cervix is over,

15:34.183 --> 15:36.268
and to lie together
as one.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.061
No, the service.

15:38.146 --> 15:43.358
The cervix is
a circular wing of muscles
that contracts or expands.

15:43.526 --> 15:45.235
It's up in your vagina.

15:45.486 --> 15:48.030
That's where
my penis will go
after the wedding.

15:48.114 --> 15:49.114
(CHUCKLES)

15:49.198 --> 15:50.907
Have you not
consummated your love?

15:50.992 --> 15:52.034
FABIOUS: Not yet.

15:52.368 --> 15:54.077
Belladonna has
never been with a man

15:54.162 --> 15:57.205
so we've decided to
preserve her purity
till after the wedding.

15:57.999 --> 16:00.667
She's given me this ribbon
from her fair hair.

16:00.752 --> 16:04.421
To hold on to until
we can be together
in a sex-way.

16:05.339 --> 16:06.757
Yes.

TALLIOUS:
Enough, enough.

16:11.429 --> 16:13.096

to play forgetful

16:13.181 --> 16:14.681
on his brother's day
of days,

16:14.766 --> 16:16.391
then wait we shall not.

16:16.601 --> 16:20.103
I can't get married
without my brother.
He's my best man.

16:20.229 --> 16:23.356
His time has passed.
Pick another best man.

16:23.441 --> 16:24.483
No.

16:24.567 --> 16:27.360
Julie, you be best man.
Here you are.

you trolls have it so easy.

Out here
playing recklessly
in your beautiful mud.

of horse meats
and crumbs.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.835
Green grass.
Green grass.

16:44.295 --> 16:46.963
And do tell,
how do you get so dirty?

16:47.423 --> 16:51.176
You just take the earth
and rub it upon your face?

16:51.636 --> 16:52.969
Your Highness,

16:54.347 --> 16:57.432
the wedding has... Hello.
The wedding has started.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.601
I do not care.

16:59.852 --> 17:02.187
I'd rather stay with
this fine gentleman.

17:02.313 --> 17:03.438
Hiding here with
my true friends.

17:03.523 --> 17:04.606
Yes.

17:04.690 --> 17:08.819
Let the whole
entire wedding wonder
and worry where I am.

I've been waiting for

You have a beauty
I can't ignore

17:48.734 --> 17:53.905
Bastion of all I do adore

Are you lost?

18:23.519 --> 18:27.731
A thousand pardons.
I mean not to intrude on
such a joyous occasion.

18:28.691 --> 18:32.152
However, today I just
could not help myself.

to meet your doom.

18:43.581 --> 18:45.498
LEEZAR: Oh, brave Fabious.

18:45.750 --> 18:49.753
You murdered my Cyclops.
But I have other perils
in store for you.

18:50.504 --> 18:53.215
Ones that are beyond
the bounds of
your imagination.

18:53.382 --> 18:54.758
One, in particular,

18:54.926 --> 18:56.676
involving an ancient
prophecy destined

18:56.761 --> 18:59.346
to be fulfilled by
a powerful warlock,

18:59.430 --> 19:00.513
me.

a very beautiful virgin
that looks just like

Her.
(CROWD GASPS IN HORROR)

19:07.897 --> 19:11.650
I was keeping that one
for something very special.

19:11.817 --> 19:15.403
And I dare say
it was rude of you
to steal her from me.

19:15.571 --> 19:16.863
Now I'm here
to get her back.

19:17.114 --> 19:19.658
And just how
do you plan
on doing that?

thank god you're alive.

for the wedding,
I feared the worst.

Why are you crying?

Yes.

about to embark on
yet another quest.

rescue Belladonna

hearing about it.

Fabious' 28th quest.

22:06.742 --> 22:08.284
How many have
you been on?

22:08.369 --> 22:10.995
Courtney,
how many quests
have I completed?

22:11.080 --> 22:12.247
Uh...

22:12.581 --> 22:14.833
The answer is none.

22:14.917 --> 22:17.544
It is finally time
for you to become a man.

22:17.628 --> 22:20.588
You must journey
with your brother
to rescue his bride.

22:20.798 --> 22:22.507
THADEOUS: Father,
you can't be serious.

22:22.591 --> 22:23.800
If you want me to
go on to a quest,

22:23.884 --> 22:25.260
then let's start
with something easy,

22:25.344 --> 22:28.596
like boiling a chicken
or beating off in front
of a Pegasus.

22:28.681 --> 22:30.223
Elementary things.

22:30.474 --> 22:34.436
Look around you at the harm
that has befallen this castle!

22:36.897 --> 22:38.940
This quest is
your last chance

22:39.024 --> 22:41.484
to prove to me
and the kingdom

22:41.569 --> 22:44.654
that you are a man worthy
to bear the family crest,

22:44.738 --> 22:47.907
and to show
that at your core,
you are not rotten,

22:48.409 --> 22:51.703
but you are brave,
and honorable, and noble.

22:51.871 --> 22:54.706
All the qualities
expected of a prince.

22:54.790 --> 22:56.082
The choice is yours.

22:56.417 --> 22:59.002
Either journey
with your brother
and the Knights Elite,

22:59.086 --> 23:01.921
or you can face banishment
from the kingdom.

23:02.715 --> 23:03.798
Shit.

23:14.477 --> 23:15.810
(HORSES NEIGHING)

23:25.613 --> 23:26.821
(SIMON SCREECHING)

23:29.783 --> 23:31.117
You see, Courtney,

23:31.202 --> 23:34.370
I alone understand how
to properly prepare
for a quest.

23:34.622 --> 23:38.625
Masculine garments,
proper, good collie
to smoke upon.

23:38.792 --> 23:40.460
How is Steven doing?

23:40.628 --> 23:42.462
He looks like
he's stoned, sir.

23:42.630 --> 23:43.922
Fabious has Simon,

23:44.006 --> 23:47.550
and now I have Steven,
a far superior
creature companion.

23:47.635 --> 23:48.968
Wouldn't you agree?

23:49.136 --> 23:51.804
He will fare
very well, indeed,
I'm sure, Your Highness.

23:51.889 --> 23:54.724
I do hope this adventure
is not too stressful
or boring.

23:54.808 --> 23:59.145
Either way I intend to
get properly fucked up
if no one disagrees.

24:16.163 --> 24:19.040
Belladonna, wake up.
Wake up.

24:19.208 --> 24:21.251
Who is that?
Where am I?

24:21.335 --> 24:23.211
'Tis I, Fabious.
Your love.

24:23.295 --> 24:24.504
(GASPS)

24:24.880 --> 24:25.880
Fabious?

24:26.048 --> 24:27.799
You're still
in Leezar's lair.

24:27.883 --> 24:30.593
But fear not,
I'm here to rescue you.

24:30.678 --> 24:32.595
Fabious,
it's really you.

24:32.680 --> 24:34.722
I knew you'd come
to find me.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.849
(LAUGHING RAUCOUSLY)

24:40.980 --> 24:44.857
I can't do this.
I can't do it.
It's so mean.

24:45.859 --> 24:49.696
You should've seen
the look on your face.
It's me!

24:50.406 --> 24:51.990
You're still a prisoner.

24:52.157 --> 24:54.826
I've seen
a beautiful world
beyond this prison,

24:54.910 --> 24:57.161
and I count the hours
till I escape.

24:57.413 --> 24:59.289
I wouldn't be
so sure of that.

24:59.373 --> 25:03.543
Lookie there.
The twin moons
drawing slowly together.

25:03.836 --> 25:06.337
Time moving them closer.

25:06.505 --> 25:10.383
Just as time moves you
and I closer together.

25:10.676 --> 25:13.886
And when
the two moons unite,
so shall we.

25:14.221 --> 25:17.765
Perhaps, keeping you
in this tower has
left you ignorant.

25:17.850 --> 25:20.310
You're so easily deceived.

25:20.561 --> 25:24.564
For example, I have heard
that your Prince Fabious

25:24.732 --> 25:27.859
has made
his bed recklessly
with many maidens.

25:29.945 --> 25:34.657
And I heard that he has fungi
on his genitalia as a result.

25:34.867 --> 25:37.243
Also, he organizes orgies

25:37.578 --> 25:40.330
with wenches and
barbarians alike

25:40.414 --> 25:44.834
and he takes sperm on him
and gives it to women freely.

25:45.252 --> 25:47.211
Spilling his seed
willy-nilly

25:47.379 --> 25:50.590
as he makes his way
through that orgy.

25:50.799 --> 25:52.842
I don't believe you.

25:52.926 --> 25:56.846
He is not
the dashing young man
you believe him to be.

25:57.139 --> 25:58.139
So

25:59.933 --> 26:03.895
these are
the harsh realities
of the outside world.

26:05.814 --> 26:07.482
Welcome home.

26:10.319 --> 26:12.654
SOLDIER: Halt! Steady.

26:16.200 --> 26:17.200
Oh.

26:17.326 --> 26:19.410
Sorry to disturb
you two love birds

26:19.578 --> 26:22.372
but we've arrived
at the home
of the Wize Wizard.

26:22.539 --> 26:23.998
Who the hell is
the Wize Wizard?

26:24.291 --> 26:26.084
He's an ancient seer
who helps many

26:26.168 --> 26:27.960
on their quest
with added insight.

26:28.045 --> 26:31.047
Great.
Well, let me know
how it goes.

26:31.215 --> 26:33.174
Leave him in
his carriage, Fabious.

26:33.258 --> 26:35.510
You and I
will seek counsel
with the Wize Wizard.

26:35.594 --> 26:36.636
No.

26:36.720 --> 26:40.014
Come, Brother.
This is the first stop
on your first quest.

26:40.099 --> 26:42.642
We shall go together.

26:48.857 --> 26:50.316
(ARMOR SQUEAKING)

26:53.028 --> 26:54.404
(GRUNTING)

26:54.488 --> 26:55.530
Brother,

26:55.698 --> 26:57.323
you look ravishing
in that armor,

26:57.408 --> 26:59.617
but I don't think
you'll need it.

26:59.743 --> 27:02.620
The Wize Wizard
is a peaceful,
little old man.

27:03.455 --> 27:05.540
I'm wearing it.
You're just being jealous.

27:05.708 --> 27:06.749
Shit!

27:06.834 --> 27:07.834
Thadeous!

27:09.378 --> 27:11.003
Fuck.

27:12.464 --> 27:15.174
Hello? Anyone home?

27:17.886 --> 27:20.972
THADEOUS: Looks as if
someone is cultivating
glorious herbs in here.

27:21.056 --> 27:23.015
FABIOUS: Hey, Wize Wizard,
is that you over there?

27:23.308 --> 27:26.853
WIZE WIZARD:
Who dares enter my den?

27:27.521 --> 27:31.149
It is I, Prince Fabious
and my brother,
Prince Thadeous.

27:31.316 --> 27:33.192
We come
to seek counsel.

27:33.318 --> 27:35.737
Come, come.
Give me kisses.

27:38.949 --> 27:40.241
(MOANING)

27:44.204 --> 27:45.997
Kiss him.

27:46.081 --> 27:47.081
Fuck, no.

27:47.166 --> 27:48.166
Pretty please.

27:48.250 --> 27:49.542
Kiss it on the mouth.

27:50.043 --> 27:52.044
For the quest.

27:52.171 --> 27:54.464
I do it
every time I come.

27:57.092 --> 28:00.219
Hello.
Nice to meet you.

28:01.638 --> 28:02.722
(MOANING)

28:03.390 --> 28:04.849
Oh, god.

28:05.017 --> 28:06.476
Sit, sit.

28:06.560 --> 28:07.643
Sit.

28:07.728 --> 28:11.731
Fabious has
been coming here
since he was a boy.

28:11.899 --> 28:13.983
You did this when
you were a child.

28:14.067 --> 28:15.151
FABIOUS: Yes!

28:15.402 --> 28:17.069
We had great times,
didn't we?

28:17.404 --> 28:19.405
Yes, yes, we did.

28:19.490 --> 28:20.490
(WIZE WIZARD CHUCKLES)

28:20.574 --> 28:22.366
You would kiss him?

28:22.451 --> 28:23.826
WIZE WIZARD: Mmm-hmm.

28:23.911 --> 28:26.746
Yeah, sometimes we
would do other things.

28:26.872 --> 28:28.581
Like what?

28:28.749 --> 28:31.918
When I was younger,
we'd take our shirts off
and jump on the bed.

28:32.002 --> 28:34.587
Playful secrets.

28:35.422 --> 28:36.422
Don't tell father.

28:36.507 --> 28:37.548
WIZE WIZARD: Hmm.

28:37.716 --> 28:39.967
Breathe deeply
of these herbs

28:40.052 --> 28:41.844
and share a vision
with me.

28:41.929 --> 28:43.012
FABIOUS: Of course.

28:43.096 --> 28:44.096
(CLEARS THROAT)

28:46.016 --> 28:47.391
(CHUCKLING)

28:48.352 --> 28:51.062
Yes. Allow me
to puff as well.

28:51.146 --> 28:52.355
WIZE WIZARD: Hmm.

28:52.940 --> 28:54.440
(SIGHS)

28:55.275 --> 28:58.069
(WHISTLES)
Those are
some powerful herbs.

28:58.237 --> 29:00.279
Giving me dark visions.

29:00.447 --> 29:01.989
Shall we pack
this again?

29:02.074 --> 29:04.575
I'm not getting visions.
I'm not sure if
it's working, Wizard.

29:04.660 --> 29:05.701
(GROANING)

29:05.786 --> 29:08.287
Visions. Visions.

29:08.413 --> 29:10.706
Thadeous,
are you seeing
what I'm seeing?

29:10.874 --> 29:12.083
You making
a fool yourself.

29:12.167 --> 29:13.668
Handle your shit,
Fabious, please.

29:13.752 --> 29:14.919
No, I can't.

29:16.171 --> 29:18.506
Please, interpret
these visions, Wizard.

29:18.757 --> 29:21.843
Prophecies foretell
of an evil wizard

29:21.969 --> 29:24.595
laying his seed
inside a virgin

29:24.680 --> 29:26.973
under the eclipse
of the two moons.

29:27.307 --> 29:29.851
What? What evil
prophecy is this?

29:29.935 --> 29:31.394
The child
she would spawn

29:31.478 --> 29:34.021
is said to be
a dragon most powerful.

29:34.314 --> 29:38.401
Ew. Leezar wants to make love
to Belladonna to
create a dragon?

29:38.485 --> 29:40.611
That's fucking disgusting.
(FABIOUS GROANS)

29:40.696 --> 29:42.029
FABIOUS: I cannot
let this happen.

29:42.281 --> 29:43.406
When is this eclipse?

29:43.490 --> 29:45.157
In five nights' time,

29:45.492 --> 29:49.537
but you will need
an enchanted blade
to do this warlock in.

29:49.621 --> 29:52.206
A blade made
of unicorn horn.

29:52.541 --> 29:55.418
Say where I can
find such a sword
and it shall be mine.

29:55.502 --> 29:59.380
It rests in the depths
of the most perilous
hidden labyrinth.

29:59.715 --> 30:02.174
Just beyond
Muldiss Darton.

30:02.342 --> 30:03.467
Muldiss Darton.

30:03.635 --> 30:06.137
Well, what is
Muldiss Darton?

30:06.305 --> 30:07.972
It's a place of legend.

30:08.181 --> 30:09.765
(EXHALES)

30:15.147 --> 30:17.440
FABIOUS: Oh. Powerful magic.

30:17.566 --> 30:20.276
This crooked compass
will catch the light

30:20.360 --> 30:23.529
and point the way to
the labyrinth's location.

30:23.697 --> 30:24.989
Be warned,

30:25.073 --> 30:29.035
they say
the walls of this maze
drive men to madness.

30:29.202 --> 30:31.370
But if you can
find your way,

30:31.455 --> 30:33.748
the blade will be yours.

30:34.875 --> 30:36.792
Thank you,
Wize Wizard.

30:36.877 --> 30:40.129
Not so fast. First you
must answer a riddle.

30:40.422 --> 30:45.384
What journey be
long and twisted
and sensitive at hand?

30:45.552 --> 30:50.348
To what end must man go
to discover the depths
of his ecstasy?

30:50.891 --> 30:53.184
Think hard,
strong warriors.
(CHUCKLES)

30:54.061 --> 30:55.478
Fuck, I know this.

30:55.562 --> 30:56.604
Oh. (CONTINUES CHUCKLING)

30:56.688 --> 30:57.730
FABIOUS: I've got it!

30:58.231 --> 31:02.944
You want us to
twist what is long
with our sensitive hands.

31:03.236 --> 31:04.904
He wants us
to jerk him off.

31:05.155 --> 31:07.698
Just punch the tip
and twist it.

31:07.783 --> 31:10.785
Yes, but we are
not going to do that.

31:11.453 --> 31:14.538
If it's for the quest,
we will do what
needs to be done.

31:14.623 --> 31:15.873
(CHUCKLING)

31:16.458 --> 31:19.835
I'll work the tip,
you tickle his balls.

31:20.879 --> 31:22.129
(MOANING)

31:26.468 --> 31:27.468
Yuck!

31:28.053 --> 31:29.053
Pervert.

31:29.137 --> 31:30.262
Did you get
any information?

31:30.430 --> 31:32.473
Let's just make camp.

31:32.557 --> 31:35.518
Sick. This quest sucks.

31:36.520 --> 31:37.937
It used to be you
that joined him.

31:38.021 --> 31:39.188
Yes.

31:41.149 --> 31:44.151
Don't worry.
All will be well.

31:48.615 --> 31:49.699
Ha!

31:50.992 --> 31:52.076
(CHIRPING)

31:52.160 --> 31:53.369
(GROANING)

31:53.453 --> 31:55.996
Attentions please,
warriors.

31:56.164 --> 31:57.832
I propose a toast.

31:57.999 --> 32:00.626
Let us drink till
thine asses are drunk.

32:00.794 --> 32:02.712
Brother,
we do not celebrate

32:02.796 --> 32:04.588
until we complete
the quest at hand.

32:04.673 --> 32:06.298
It is the code of
the Knights Elite.

32:06.383 --> 32:09.635
What of my code
where we drink like men?

32:09.720 --> 32:10.928
Thadeous,
we have some traditions

32:11.012 --> 32:12.722
of our own out here
on the road.

32:13.682 --> 32:16.600
Manious, prepare
the warrior's tidings,
if you will.

32:16.768 --> 32:21.021
If it is the first night
of your first quest, well...

32:26.361 --> 32:27.361
MANIOUS: Here it comes.

32:27.612 --> 32:28.612
(GRUNTING)

32:28.697 --> 32:30.197
THADEOUS: Disgusting.

32:32.159 --> 32:34.118
Feast upon
the heart of the beast.

32:34.202 --> 32:35.828
No, thank you,
I'm not hungry.

32:35.912 --> 32:38.330
It is a tradition
among men.

32:38.665 --> 32:40.499
Eat it.
Eat it.

32:40.667 --> 32:42.752
BOREMONT: Eat it.
Eat it.

32:42.836 --> 32:46.547

33:03.523 --> 33:05.441
You fuckers!
That's not funny!

33:05.692 --> 33:07.151
You're not supposed
to eat it.

33:07.360 --> 33:08.527
You all were chanting.

33:08.612 --> 33:11.447
Maybe there's
some donkey cock
in your carriage!

33:11.656 --> 33:14.074
Fuck you, Boremont!
Manious, fuck you!

33:14.201 --> 33:15.409
I hate all of you.

33:15.494 --> 33:16.869
Thadeous!

33:17.245 --> 33:18.412
Come back.

33:18.914 --> 33:21.081
Thadeous, come here.

Dark master,

33:49.903 --> 33:52.863
it is I, Julie.

33:52.948 --> 33:53.989
(URINATING)

33:54.074 --> 33:56.033
We have crossed
the hazel meadow,

33:56.201 --> 33:59.453
and are now taking rest
at the Cliffs of Kuneman.

33:59.621 --> 34:02.915
Now that
the Princes of Mourne
have left their stronghold

34:03.083 --> 34:05.376
their vulnerabilities
are in your hands.

34:05.544 --> 34:06.710
My hands.

34:06.795 --> 34:08.462
Bring Prince Fabious
to me alive.

34:08.713 --> 34:11.465
I would like him to witness
as I impregnate his love.

34:11.632 --> 34:12.800
(LAUGHS) lmpregnate.

34:12.926 --> 34:14.385
As for Thadeous
and his boy,

34:14.469 --> 34:18.054
toss them from
the Cliffs of Kuneman.
They're useless.

34:20.100 --> 34:21.475
Fart.

34:22.393 --> 34:24.353
Knock, knock.
May I come in?

34:24.521 --> 34:27.231
No, leave me alone.
Get out of here.

34:27.315 --> 34:31.610
Thadeous,
you must calm down.
It's over.

34:31.820 --> 34:34.321
You ate the heart,
you passed the initiation.

34:34.406 --> 34:35.406
Passed?

34:35.489 --> 34:37.491
You made me
look stupid in front
of all your friends.

34:37.659 --> 34:40.202
And don't think
I'm not telling father
because I'm going to.

34:40.286 --> 34:43.581
Thadeous, we were
just having some fun,
and it was perfect.

34:43.748 --> 34:46.000
Now they know you're
not to be fucked with.

34:46.167 --> 34:48.168
Excuse me, sir,
sorry for the intrusion.

34:48.253 --> 34:50.545
I have just witnessed
a most disturbing incident.

34:50.714 --> 34:52.547
FABIOUS: There must be
a misunderstanding.

34:52.632 --> 34:54.466
Julie is my most
trusted confidant.

34:54.551 --> 34:55.801
(LAUGHS)
Julie is an idiot.

34:55.886 --> 34:57.303
No, he's not.
He's a gentleman.

34:57.387 --> 34:58.971
Julie is what,
Your Highness?

34:59.180 --> 35:00.598
I'm not sure, Julie.

35:00.682 --> 35:02.850
Courtney said he saw
some suspicious behavior.

35:03.101 --> 35:07.229
You, I saw you
talking with Leezar.

35:08.189 --> 35:09.398
(LAUGHING)

35:09.608 --> 35:13.110
How dare you watch me
in my private moments.

35:13.737 --> 35:15.195
(CASTING SPELL)

35:15.864 --> 35:17.239
(ALL GROANING)

35:17.616 --> 35:18.699
(LAUGHING MANIACALLY)

35:18.783 --> 35:20.242
He's stolen my vision.

35:20.493 --> 35:21.535
FABIOUS:
Get him, Courtney!

35:23.788 --> 35:24.788
Come here!

35:24.873 --> 35:26.081
(GRUNTING)

35:27.876 --> 35:28.959
You old beast.

35:29.669 --> 35:31.503
Courtney,
just restrain him
with all your might.

35:31.588 --> 35:33.130
No, slay him!

35:33.423 --> 35:34.465
Murder him!

35:34.591 --> 35:35.883
Die of me.

35:40.263 --> 35:41.597
What?

35:41.765 --> 35:44.266
(GRUNTING) Don't move,
you're surrounded.

35:44.601 --> 35:45.726
(GASPS)
THADEOUS: Ew!

35:45.936 --> 35:47.227
Julie has no dick!

35:47.312 --> 35:48.395
Ew.

35:48.480 --> 35:49.563
Boremont!

35:49.731 --> 35:50.856
JULIE: Help!

35:52.025 --> 35:53.150
(EXCLAIMING)

35:53.360 --> 35:54.360
Knights!

35:54.444 --> 35:55.945
A turncoat has
been discovered!

35:56.112 --> 35:57.613
Prince Fabious,
what is wrong?

35:57.781 --> 35:59.156
Boremont, seize Julie,

35:59.240 --> 36:00.699
I'm afraid
he's betrayed us!

36:00.784 --> 36:02.910
That thing is
a dickless traitor!

36:03.161 --> 36:04.662
BOREMONT:
A traitor, you say.
BOTH: Yes.

36:04.829 --> 36:07.373
I saw him seeking counsel
with Leezar.

36:07.540 --> 36:10.209
Counsel? With Leezar?

36:11.002 --> 36:13.212
Well, if what
they say is true,

36:13.296 --> 36:16.090
then, Julie,
I have but one
question for you.

36:16.675 --> 36:18.634
What were
our master's orders?

36:18.718 --> 36:19.802
What?

36:19.886 --> 36:21.095
JULIE: His orders
were simple.

36:21.638 --> 36:24.223
Capture Fabious
and kill the rest.

36:24.391 --> 36:27.226
Boremont,
how could you?

36:27.310 --> 36:28.852
What about the code
of the Knights Elite?

36:28.937 --> 36:29.979
BOREMONT: Code?

36:30.271 --> 36:32.189
Upon your choice
of best man
for your wedding,

36:32.273 --> 36:34.566
your "code"
became clear to me.

36:34.651 --> 36:36.485
You hurt my feelings.

36:36.903 --> 36:38.737
Now I shall hurt yours.

36:40.198 --> 36:41.657
Kill them all!

36:41.825 --> 36:43.450
Look out!

36:45.870 --> 36:46.954
(WOOD CREAKING)

36:48.123 --> 36:49.331
(EXCLAIMS)

36:50.417 --> 36:51.417
To the carriage!

36:51.501 --> 36:53.210
THADEOUS: Your friends tried
to slay us.

36:53.294 --> 36:55.921
Those bastards!
Get in!

36:57.632 --> 36:59.133
(GRUNTING)

37:01.219 --> 37:02.344
After them!

37:02.429 --> 37:03.429
Okay, go!

37:03.513 --> 37:04.763
(URGING HORSES)

37:13.732 --> 37:15.274
We've got company!

37:15.442 --> 37:16.650
Ready yourselves!

37:16.735 --> 37:17.985
These men are fierce!

37:24.117 --> 37:25.242
Oh, gods!

37:27.495 --> 37:28.662
(GRUNTING)

37:29.372 --> 37:30.706
(SCREAMS)

37:40.258 --> 37:41.258
(YELLS)

37:49.392 --> 37:50.893
FABIOUS:
Under the cart you go!

37:55.065 --> 37:56.982
Fucking sword!
Stab him!

37:57.150 --> 37:58.400
Stab him!

37:59.277 --> 38:00.736
(SCREAMING)

38:02.864 --> 38:04.448
(EXCLAIMS IN DISGUST)

38:04.532 --> 38:06.325
You cut his hair off!

38:16.002 --> 38:17.127
Oh!

38:17.212 --> 38:18.504
Fabious, he's coming!

38:18.671 --> 38:20.339
I know, get up here!

38:25.428 --> 38:26.887
(THADEOUS EXCLAIMS)

38:26.971 --> 38:27.971
Come on!

38:31.601 --> 38:32.684
THADEOUS: Now what?

38:32.936 --> 38:35.646
I have a plan.
We jump on the horses
and ride away.

38:36.314 --> 38:37.898
But the horses,
they're moving.

38:38.066 --> 38:39.983
I know. I know.

38:41.152 --> 38:42.402
(GRUNTING)

38:42.487 --> 38:43.987
Oh, shit!

38:44.405 --> 38:45.572
(EXCLAIMS)

38:48.284 --> 38:49.326
Come on!

38:49.410 --> 38:50.661
What? Want me, as well?

38:50.829 --> 38:51.912
Now!
(SCREAMS)

38:56.126 --> 38:57.668
Face me, you traitor.

39:01.005 --> 39:02.131
(GROANS)

39:08.596 --> 39:09.972
(GROANING)

39:23.027 --> 39:24.069
Look!

39:24.154 --> 39:25.279
COURTNEY: Oh, shit!

39:25.363 --> 39:26.446
(BOTH SHOUTING)

39:39.919 --> 39:41.545
(MANIOUS AND THUNDARIAN
SCREAMING)

39:42.922 --> 39:44.131
We did it!

39:44.799 --> 39:46.133
(GRUNTS)

39:47.969 --> 39:49.261
FABIOUS: Ka-boom!

39:49.429 --> 39:50.846
COURTNEY: (LAUGHING) Yes!

39:53.933 --> 39:55.767
LEEZAR: If I could have
everyone's attention.

39:56.311 --> 39:58.854
I'd like to say
a few words, if I may.

39:59.022 --> 40:01.356
I have prepared
this feast

40:01.524 --> 40:04.443
in honor
and appreciation
of Belladonna.

40:04.611 --> 40:06.862
Seems like it
was only yesterday

40:06.946 --> 40:10.407
that we used sorcery
to burn your village
to the ground,

40:10.950 --> 40:12.242
come in and snatch you.

40:12.660 --> 40:13.827
But I remember
looking at you

40:13.912 --> 40:15.329
all those years ago
and thinking,

40:15.705 --> 40:18.207
"Wow, that's a baby."

40:18.374 --> 40:21.335
"And that's the baby
that someday I will have
to have sex with."

40:21.502 --> 40:23.045
Now, look at me.

40:23.213 --> 40:25.297
A 19-year-old boy,
almost a man,

40:25.381 --> 40:26.423
(LAUGHS)

40:26.507 --> 40:28.050
Still a virgin.
