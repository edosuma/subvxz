01:00.702 --> 01:04.702
== sync, corrected by <font color="#00ff00">elderman</font> ==

01:15.816 --> 01:17.784
Checked you out
from head to toe.

01:17.818 --> 01:19.785
You seem perfectly normal.

01:19.820 --> 01:21.955
Well, what if it wasn't something
physical but psychological?

01:21.989 --> 01:23.089
Could they have given me

01:23.123 --> 01:26.092
some kind of
posthypnotic suggestion?

01:26.127 --> 01:30.663
And turned you into what --
a sleeper agent?

01:30.697 --> 01:32.164
I don't think anyone,

01:32.199 --> 01:35.200
even a supposedly
advanced race of aliens,

01:35.235 --> 01:37.168
could get Tom Mason
to turn against his boys.

01:37.203 --> 01:39.571
You've got a lot of faith
in a man

01:39.605 --> 01:42.508
who walked onto a spaceship
of his own free will.

01:42.542 --> 01:44.176
They threatened
to take Ben away.

01:44.211 --> 01:47.180
It was a lie.
And I fell for it.

01:47.214 --> 01:49.015
I left my boys
to fend for themselves

01:49.050 --> 01:50.851
for the last three months.

01:50.885 --> 01:54.455
Tom, you have to believe,
I-I tried to be there for them.

01:54.489 --> 01:56.557
Oh, I know.

01:56.625 --> 01:59.861
Truth is, your boys
are amazingly resilient.

01:59.895 --> 02:01.896
If anything,
they've grown stronger.

02:01.964 --> 02:03.632
And you?

02:05.101 --> 02:07.069
I'm alive.

02:07.103 --> 02:09.838
Can't say that
for most of us.

02:11.508 --> 02:13.476
Lost a lot of really good people
right here,

02:13.510 --> 02:14.978
right on this table.

02:15.012 --> 02:19.482
The worst part of it is,
I have trouble remembering

02:19.516 --> 02:22.885
what they looked like,
what they sounded like.

02:22.920 --> 02:24.721
They're just fading away.

02:24.755 --> 02:28.225
So I started pinning up
their pictures,

02:28.259 --> 02:30.694
trying to hang on
to them.

02:37.001 --> 02:41.637
Uncle Scott.
Rick didn't make it?

02:41.672 --> 02:42.905
I don't know.

02:42.939 --> 02:46.108
One day he was there.
Next day, he was gone.

02:46.176 --> 02:48.744
If you're worried about Ben,
do not be.

02:48.778 --> 02:51.613
Ben hates the Skitters.

02:51.647 --> 02:53.281
Weaver says he's one
of our best fighters.

02:53.316 --> 02:55.583
Yeah, but he's still got
those spikes in his spine.

02:55.617 --> 02:58.185
And the crusty skin
is spreading.

02:58.220 --> 02:59.754
If we had an X-ray,

02:59.788 --> 03:01.723
I could find out
what's going on inside of him,

03:01.757 --> 03:03.258
but until I get my hands
on a working machine,

03:03.292 --> 03:05.093
there's no way to know.

03:05.127 --> 03:07.595
Just like there's no way to know
what's going on inside of me,

03:07.630 --> 03:11.099
despite what you or Weaver
or I would like to believe.

03:17.241 --> 03:19.942
Bridge looks good!

03:19.976 --> 03:22.077
I mean, considering.

03:22.112 --> 03:25.280
We may have a real shot
at crossing here, guys.

03:25.314 --> 03:27.549
That's good.

03:27.583 --> 03:29.084
Aliens have blown up
every other bridge

03:29.118 --> 03:31.753
within a hundred miles
of here.

03:31.788 --> 03:35.823
Got us pinned
on this side of the river.

03:39.327 --> 03:41.095
Better get back
with the intel.

03:41.129 --> 03:43.965
The longer we stand around,
the closer the Skitters are

03:43.999 --> 03:46.600
to finding us and turning
2nd Mass into roadkill.

03:48.637 --> 03:50.137
Practicing
operational silence?

03:50.172 --> 03:53.975
Because you've
hardly said a word all day.

03:54.009 --> 03:55.976
You know,
it's not your fault.

03:56.011 --> 03:58.246
That's what everyone
keeps telling me.

03:58.280 --> 04:02.117
Hey, Ben, Jimmy!
Let's go!

04:02.151 --> 04:05.254
Who would have expected
your dad to have been there

04:05.288 --> 04:06.989
after three months?

04:07.023 --> 04:10.593
It was dark, Skitters
on our heels, something moved.

04:10.628 --> 04:12.128
Anyone would have shot.

04:12.163 --> 04:15.265
Well, it wasn't anyone.
It was me.

04:20.303 --> 04:23.305
Incoming!

04:28.177 --> 04:31.145
Get down, Ben!

04:31.180 --> 04:32.980
Get it, Dai!
Damn it!

04:51.233 --> 04:53.168
Nice shot, Dai.

04:53.202 --> 04:56.738
20 Mike-Mike,
armor-piercing discarding sabot.

04:56.806 --> 04:58.639
Accept no substitutes.

04:58.674 --> 05:00.942
Nice!

05:03.045 --> 05:05.279
Well, I guess
we can't cross here.

05:10.684 --> 05:12.684
After we attacked
that structure in Boston

05:12.710 --> 05:14.077
the aliens want us
like hounds on a fox.

05:14.144 --> 05:17.213
Tried every trick I could
think of to shake them,

05:17.248 --> 05:19.383
but, uh,
they surrounded us...

05:19.417 --> 05:21.151
in Fitchburg.

05:23.754 --> 05:26.389
It was a disaster.

05:26.423 --> 05:28.591
They poured fire on us
from all sides,

05:28.659 --> 05:31.294
till Ben found a soft spot
in their lines

05:31.329 --> 05:33.763
and we managed
to punch through.

05:33.798 --> 05:36.633
But we lost
a lot of people.

05:36.668 --> 05:39.303
We lost
more than a hundred.

05:39.337 --> 05:42.305
My God.

05:42.339 --> 05:46.609
And now the bastards
are trying to do it again.

05:46.677 --> 05:49.045
We got the Housatonic River
right here.

05:49.079 --> 05:52.916
It runs to the west,
to the south.

05:52.950 --> 05:55.118
We are here.

05:55.152 --> 05:59.855
And their units have cut us off
from the north and the east.

05:59.890 --> 06:01.390
And they're moving in.

06:01.425 --> 06:05.361
And if I don't find a way
to get across that river,

06:05.395 --> 06:06.929
they're gonna pin
the 2nd Mass in,

06:06.963 --> 06:08.363
and they're gonna
destroy us.

06:08.398 --> 06:10.733
And that is why
I need you.

06:10.767 --> 06:14.403
Yeah.

06:14.437 --> 06:17.139
How have my boys done?

06:21.844 --> 06:23.945
Thank God
for Hal and Ben.

06:23.980 --> 06:28.216
They really stepped up while
you were gone -- both of them.

06:28.250 --> 06:33.087
But they're young, and
they're not ready to be my X.O.,

06:33.121 --> 06:35.689
which is why I need somebody who
can ask me the hard questions,

06:35.724 --> 06:39.193
who can give me a swift kick in
the butt if I need it, you know?

06:39.227 --> 06:42.697
We can't afford
another Fitchburg, Tom.

06:42.732 --> 06:47.101
Now, the scouts should be back
to camp pretty soon, and I...

06:47.135 --> 06:50.037
I'm hoping that they found
a way across this damn river,

06:50.072 --> 06:51.806
and I want you
at the debrief.

06:56.745 --> 06:58.713
Dan, I can't.

06:58.747 --> 07:00.214
I know that
you're not completely healed.

07:00.249 --> 07:01.816
I'm not asking you to do anything.
No, no. No.

07:01.850 --> 07:03.851
The wound's not the problem.
I just nicked a rib.

07:03.919 --> 07:05.787
Anne will have the stitches out
next week.

07:05.821 --> 07:07.889
Then what is it?

07:09.359 --> 07:13.062
I don't trust myself.

07:13.097 --> 07:15.397
And you shouldn't,
either.

07:17.100 --> 07:18.467
You giving me
orders now?

07:18.501 --> 07:21.469
I'll decide
who I can trust.

07:21.504 --> 07:24.338
And I'll put my money
on the man

07:24.373 --> 07:28.175
who pulled my ass
out of the fire in Boston.

07:28.209 --> 07:30.210
No, it's true.
Dylan's alive.

07:30.245 --> 07:32.312
He's holed up in a mine shaft
in Minnesota,

07:32.346 --> 07:35.014
rewriting his protest songs
into war ballads.

07:35.049 --> 07:36.950
Delvalle heard
one of his broadcasts

07:36.984 --> 07:38.485
over that crystal set
he built.

07:38.520 --> 07:40.387
Oh, man, that thing
doesn't even work.

07:40.455 --> 07:42.957
It couldn't pick up a
conversation in the next tent.

07:42.991 --> 07:44.359
Never mind a broadcast
from Minnesota,

07:44.393 --> 07:45.994
if there even was one.

07:46.028 --> 07:47.996
Man, shut up.
What the hell do you know?

07:48.030 --> 07:51.867
What is -- how did you do this?
Wrench slipped.

07:51.901 --> 07:55.371
Thought you might come out here
and kiss it, make it better.

07:55.406 --> 07:57.307
Aah!

07:59.977 --> 08:02.212
So, what's the deal
with the Professor?

08:02.246 --> 08:04.046
What do you mean?

08:04.081 --> 08:06.916
Just kind of figured he'd
give us all an oral history

08:06.984 --> 08:08.885
in alien-interrogation
techniques,

08:08.920 --> 08:10.754
but all we got
is brooding silence.

08:10.822 --> 08:12.423
Well...
What's up with that, now?

08:12.490 --> 08:15.760
I'm a medic, not a shrink.

08:15.827 --> 08:17.896
Scouts are back!

08:17.930 --> 08:20.331
Let's hope they find a way
across that damn river.

08:23.102 --> 08:24.435
Good luck.

08:24.503 --> 08:26.437
Yeah,
this should be fun.

08:28.941 --> 08:30.442
Is the Captain
in there?

08:30.510 --> 08:33.913
Thanks.

08:35.381 --> 08:37.950
You can't even
walk across this thing.

08:39.986 --> 08:42.354
Dollars to doughnuts,
the Beamers will

08:42.388 --> 08:44.089
bomb the hell
out of your work crews

08:44.123 --> 08:45.958
10 minutes after they started
trying to rebuild it.

08:45.992 --> 08:47.359
Yeah, well, I didn't say
I had everything worked out.

08:47.393 --> 08:49.427
I said
this is our best chance.

08:49.462 --> 08:51.262
We may be better off
probing for a weak point

08:51.297 --> 08:53.231
and then fighting
our way out.

08:53.265 --> 08:55.366
Yeah, well, the Mech
and Skitter columns I saw

08:55.400 --> 08:57.968
weren't carrying any weak points
with them.

08:58.002 --> 08:59.470
So far, we've managed
to stay hidden.

08:59.504 --> 09:01.238
But they're looking hard,
and they're closing in fast.

09:01.273 --> 09:03.574
They're gonna be on us
in two days. Tops.

09:03.608 --> 09:05.219
Why don't they
just nuke the whole damn

09:05.244 --> 09:06.610
city and be done with us?

09:06.611 --> 09:08.513
We might not be worth it.

09:08.547 --> 09:10.562
We haven't seen them drop
neutron bombs in months,

09:10.587 --> 09:11.648
not since Boston.

09:11.649 --> 09:13.436
They won't need
a nuke if they trap us on

09:13.461 --> 09:14.651
this side of the river.

09:14.652 --> 09:16.319
What about that boat

09:16.354 --> 09:17.621
that you liberated from
a sporting goods store, Jamil?

09:17.655 --> 09:19.956
It was rubber,
seats five, no motor.

09:19.990 --> 09:22.258
Best guess, it'd take us
40 minutes, round trip,

09:22.292 --> 09:23.926
across the river.

09:23.960 --> 09:25.961
No, that would take way too long
to get everybody across.

09:25.995 --> 09:27.963
Plus, we'd have to
leave all the vehicles,

09:27.997 --> 09:29.964
all the heavy weapons --
wounded, supplies.

09:29.999 --> 09:32.133
Yeah.
Not acceptable.

09:32.167 --> 09:33.698
Captain, it seems our
best and only option is

09:33.723 --> 09:35.302
to rebuild the bridge.

09:35.303 --> 09:38.406
We don't have to
rebuild it, Captain.

09:38.440 --> 09:40.208
We could
just patch it up.

09:40.242 --> 09:42.510
You know, the supports look like
hell, but I think they'll hold.

09:42.578 --> 09:44.279
We can build decking,

09:44.313 --> 09:46.548
bridge them over these gaps
and drive across.

09:46.583 --> 09:50.586
Doesn't have to last forever,
right? Just one night.

09:53.924 --> 09:56.159
We have no choice.

09:56.194 --> 09:58.528
Start building the decking,
Jamil.

09:58.596 --> 10:01.097
Hey, man,
what about the Beamers?

10:01.132 --> 10:03.100
It's too bad they learned how
to beat our jamming so quickly.

10:03.134 --> 10:05.169
We'll figure out a way
to deal with the air threat.

10:05.203 --> 10:08.305
Once we get across, we have
no idea what's in that forest.

10:08.339 --> 10:10.007
Could run smack
into an ambush.

10:10.041 --> 10:11.408
That's why somebody's got to
go across for a look-see.

10:11.442 --> 10:13.277
Anybody up for a cold swim?

10:13.311 --> 10:16.279
I'll do it. Maggie and I
will take the boat.

10:16.314 --> 10:17.547
We'll go across.
We'll check it out.

10:17.615 --> 10:19.282
It'll take you too long
to paddle across.

10:19.317 --> 10:21.084
I can swim it faster
and not be seen.

10:22.320 --> 10:24.521
Really?

10:26.358 --> 10:29.561
You've been away, Dad.
This is what I do.

10:29.628 --> 10:32.197
He's right, Tom.

10:32.231 --> 10:36.568
He's the best...
man for the job, yeah.

10:36.636 --> 10:39.337
You take Jimmy with you to cover
your route to the riverbank.

10:39.371 --> 10:40.505
Tonight.

10:43.042 --> 10:45.543
Swimming across that river's
nothing for Ben.

10:45.577 --> 10:47.045
It's those spikes.

10:47.079 --> 10:49.547
He can run for miles
without breaking a sweat.

10:49.581 --> 10:53.384
He has ears like a jack rabbit.
He can see like a hawk.

10:53.418 --> 10:56.020
Comes at quite a price.

10:56.054 --> 10:59.056
It's the world we live in,
not the world we want.

10:59.091 --> 11:01.425
I think we've all changed
a little bit.

11:01.493 --> 11:04.262
Ooh, I know.

11:04.296 --> 11:08.065
Weaver told me
how you stepped up.

11:08.100 --> 11:11.235
Saw it for myself
in that meeting.

11:11.270 --> 11:13.037
Proud of you, Hal.

11:14.574 --> 11:16.241
You know, I'm sorry.

11:16.276 --> 11:18.043
We haven't had a chance to
catch up since you've been gone,

11:18.077 --> 11:20.212
but maybe when
we get across this river,

11:20.246 --> 11:23.216
we can have a...
family dinner.

11:23.250 --> 11:26.219
Yeah, maybe. Hey.

11:26.254 --> 11:28.722
I got to ask a favor of you,
and it's important.

11:28.757 --> 11:31.058
Sure. Anything.

11:31.093 --> 11:32.627
While the aliens had me,

11:32.661 --> 11:37.265
I -- there's big chunks of time
that I can't remember.

11:37.299 --> 11:39.600
I think they may have
done something to my mind.

11:39.635 --> 11:42.537
Like what?

11:42.571 --> 11:44.672
I don't know.

11:44.707 --> 11:48.543
But I need you
to promise me something.

11:48.577 --> 11:49.744
A-anything.

11:49.779 --> 11:51.546
Just keep your eye on me.

11:51.580 --> 11:53.174
If I do anything strange,
if I do anything

11:53.175 --> 11:54.483
that would endanger the lives
of our people --

11:54.508 --> 11:56.332
Okay, but, Dad.
You're not --

11:56.551 --> 12:00.687
Yeah, but if I do,
I want you to stop me.

12:00.721 --> 12:03.556
Stop you? How?

12:03.591 --> 12:05.358
By any means necessary.

12:05.392 --> 12:08.260
You know, you've been through
a lot of crazy stuff, Dad.

12:08.295 --> 12:10.996
Let's go talk to Anne,
all right?

12:11.063 --> 12:12.597
We'll go see Weaver.

12:12.631 --> 12:14.465
No, no. I already talked to
them. Now I'm talking to you.

12:14.500 --> 12:17.135
And I'm not asking!
You got to do this!

12:17.169 --> 12:19.037
I don't want to
hurt anybody, Hal,

12:19.071 --> 12:20.772
least of all you
or Ben or Matt.

12:22.074 --> 12:24.343
I'm afraid, Hal.
I'm sc--

12:26.279 --> 12:27.680
Dad?

12:27.747 --> 12:29.681
Dad, are you okay?
Dad!

12:29.749 --> 12:33.152
Dr. Glass, come quick!
Something's happened to my Dad!

12:33.186 --> 12:35.154
Dad, I'm right here!
Dad, can you hear me?!

12:42.277 --> 12:43.778
Is he gonna be okay?

12:43.812 --> 12:45.780
Of course
he's gonna be okay.

12:45.814 --> 12:47.783
Well,
we just got him back.

12:47.817 --> 12:50.519
I know, buddy.

12:50.553 --> 12:53.255
You think it's true...

12:53.290 --> 12:55.257
what he was saying...

12:55.292 --> 12:57.793
That he might hurt us?

12:57.827 --> 12:59.828
There's no way.

13:03.866 --> 13:05.834
Look, it's Dad.

13:05.868 --> 13:09.604
Those old fish-heads couldn't
change him if they tried.

13:09.639 --> 13:12.807
He escaped from their ship,
didn't he?

13:12.842 --> 13:14.409
Found his way back to us,

13:14.443 --> 13:16.778
despite everything they did
to stop him, right?

13:16.812 --> 13:18.480
He's gonna beat this,
too.

13:18.514 --> 13:20.649
All right?

13:31.561 --> 13:33.362
This is gonna sting.

13:33.396 --> 13:36.497
Just do it.

13:43.806 --> 13:45.640
You see that?

13:45.675 --> 13:48.376
It's lodged
in his sclera.

13:48.411 --> 13:50.745
- What is it?
- Could be a cyst.

13:50.813 --> 13:54.083
You mean like
some kind of growth?

13:54.150 --> 13:57.653
No. It wasn't there when
I examined him this morning.

14:00.691 --> 14:02.391
Oh.

14:02.426 --> 14:04.727
What?! What's wrong?
- It's moving.

14:04.761 --> 14:05.550
Yank it out!

14:05.575 --> 14:07.515
Hold on, okay. You don't know
what this involves.

14:07.516 --> 14:09.214
If I get this wrong, you could
lose sight in your eye.

14:09.239 --> 14:09.898
Then I'll do it.

14:09.899 --> 14:11.266
Easy.
Oh, God.

14:11.334 --> 14:12.867
Tom, easy.
Like hell!

14:12.868 --> 14:14.019
Lourdes, get a specimen jar.

14:14.044 --> 14:16.044
Dan, hold his head steady!
I got you. Easy. Easy.

14:17.440 --> 14:19.541
Tom, easy. Hey,
it's all right. Come on.

14:19.575 --> 14:21.209
Okay.

14:22.845 --> 14:24.545
Ready?

14:44.799 --> 14:46.266
It looks like a...

14:46.301 --> 14:49.469
parasite.

14:53.875 --> 14:56.710
One long, two short
means it's me.

14:56.744 --> 14:58.712
All clear is two short,
one long.

14:58.747 --> 15:00.447
And if you got
Skitters following you?

15:00.481 --> 15:01.715
You get
the first shot.

15:01.749 --> 15:03.350
Awesome.

15:05.621 --> 15:08.489
Wait, uh,
y-you might need this.

15:10.492 --> 15:11.859
Weaver's compass.

15:11.893 --> 15:15.229
Yeah, just don't make me
come after it.

15:15.263 --> 15:16.864
That water's freezing.

15:16.898 --> 15:19.767
It's invigorating!

15:23.738 --> 15:26.005
Invigorating!

15:55.735 --> 16:00.439
Uh, you say
it just snapped shut?

16:00.474 --> 16:02.442
Like a pill bug.

16:02.476 --> 16:04.944
I don't see any seams.

16:04.979 --> 16:07.681
You should destroy it.

16:07.715 --> 16:09.482
I agree.
Yeah?

16:09.517 --> 16:12.352
What if it's a tracking device?
It could give away our position.

16:12.386 --> 16:13.720
Tom's been with us
for days.

16:13.788 --> 16:16.623
If it was
tracking our position,

16:16.657 --> 16:18.859
the alien would have
attacked us by now.

16:18.893 --> 16:23.030
Or it could be, like Tom said,
a mind-control device.

16:23.064 --> 16:25.899
Yeah.
Well, it's out now.

16:25.934 --> 16:27.634
That doesn't mean
it's the end of it.

16:27.669 --> 16:29.803
There could be others
in me.

16:29.838 --> 16:33.273
What do you recommend,
Tom?

16:33.307 --> 16:38.378
I don't think
that you've got any choice...

16:38.412 --> 16:40.746
except to put me
in restraints,

16:40.814 --> 16:44.417
at least until we get across
the river and we learn more.

16:44.451 --> 16:46.886
Tom, we removed it.
You're probably fine.

16:46.920 --> 16:48.921
You said I was fine before.
Come on.

16:48.955 --> 16:50.422
Put all personal feelings
aside.

16:50.456 --> 16:52.924
Now's not the time
to take any chances.

16:54.760 --> 16:57.529
Give me your hands.

17:40.375 --> 17:42.843
Ohh!

17:44.980 --> 17:47.815
Aah!

19:22.488 --> 19:25.156
You can go see
your old man now.

19:25.224 --> 19:26.791
I don't want to.

19:26.825 --> 19:28.693
What do you mean
you don't want to? Hey, Matt --

19:28.727 --> 19:30.595
I don't want to!

19:32.264 --> 19:33.731
Hey, Captain.

19:33.766 --> 19:36.501
I heard they pulled a
circuit board out of Tom's head.

19:36.535 --> 19:38.269
Is that true?

19:39.738 --> 19:43.441
We don't know what it is.
Dr. Glass has removed it.

19:43.475 --> 19:45.677
The scouts should be back
any minute, Pope.

19:45.711 --> 19:47.345
Report to the C.P. in 10.

19:47.380 --> 19:50.415
You're not taking him
across that river with us.

19:50.449 --> 19:52.216
That's not gonna happen.

19:52.251 --> 19:55.753
He's unarmed and in restraints.
The situation is under control.

19:55.787 --> 19:57.454
The hell it is.

19:57.489 --> 19:59.456
He could still be wired
direct to Skitter Central.

19:59.490 --> 20:01.491
Now, I'm sorry, but you should have
put a bullet in the back of his head

20:01.525 --> 20:04.227
the second he took a step
towards that ship.

20:04.261 --> 20:06.529
- I want to see --
- Hey!

20:08.665 --> 20:10.632
Two guns against one.
That's hardly fair.

20:11.934 --> 20:14.636
Actually, it's three
against one, Pope.

20:14.670 --> 20:17.706
Walk softly.

20:17.740 --> 20:19.975
Anthony,
you're a disappointment.

20:20.009 --> 20:23.511
I thought I was having
a positive influence on you.

20:28.285 --> 20:31.621
There is nothing
that I would like better

20:31.655 --> 20:34.357
than to truss you up
and leave you here.

20:34.392 --> 20:39.463
Be thankful that we need you
and your band of degenerates...

20:39.498 --> 20:40.999
for now.

20:41.033 --> 20:43.502
Get out of my sight.

20:47.374 --> 20:49.475
Don't kid your yourself,
Cap.

20:49.510 --> 20:51.444
Sooner or later,
you're gonna have to deal

20:51.478 --> 20:53.380
with that human LoJack
you got in there.

21:09.595 --> 21:10.695
Dad.

21:13.933 --> 21:16.500
Nightmares?

21:16.535 --> 21:18.002
Yeah.

21:18.037 --> 21:21.373
Yeah, I had a lot of those
after Anne took my harness off.

21:22.675 --> 21:24.943
How'd you shake them?

21:24.978 --> 21:26.578
I stopped sleeping.

21:26.612 --> 21:28.946
Hmm.

21:29.014 --> 21:30.915
Just came back
from across the river.

21:30.949 --> 21:33.584
Heard what happened.

21:33.619 --> 21:35.286
Oh,
it's for the best.

21:35.354 --> 21:37.589
Until we know more,

21:37.623 --> 21:41.592
until I can figure out
what it is that did to --

21:44.062 --> 21:45.630
Want to know my secret?

21:45.664 --> 21:47.999
To make sure
they can't control me?

21:48.033 --> 21:49.701
Mm-hmm.

21:49.735 --> 21:51.435
Hate.

21:51.469 --> 21:53.704
I hate what they did to me
with all my heart and soul.

21:53.739 --> 21:55.573
I hate that
they turned me into a freak.

21:55.608 --> 21:57.075
You're not a freak.

22:18.932 --> 22:21.633
You got to hold on
to your hate, Dad.

22:25.471 --> 22:27.638
If you can do that...

22:27.673 --> 22:29.674
if you can do that,

22:29.708 --> 22:33.811
it doesn't matter
what they've done to you...

22:33.845 --> 22:37.415
they won't be able to
change you inside.

22:40.653 --> 22:45.757
You're right.
Hate is a very powerful emotion.

22:45.791 --> 22:47.892
And I hate them, too.

22:51.062 --> 22:54.031
But if all
you've got left is hate,

22:54.065 --> 22:56.866
then they've already
changed you.

22:58.970 --> 23:02.939
It wasn't my hate that kept me
going the last couple of months.

23:02.973 --> 23:05.808
It was my love...

23:05.842 --> 23:10.445
for you and for Hal
and for Matt.

23:11.914 --> 23:14.650
Got to go.

23:24.128 --> 23:25.963
Wow.

23:25.997 --> 23:27.832
How did you find this wreck?

23:27.866 --> 23:29.701
Saw the Beamer get hit
and fly off,

23:29.735 --> 23:32.670
figured it was trying
to regroup with its forces,

23:32.704 --> 23:35.072
so I followed
the course it took.

23:35.140 --> 23:36.907
When I found the ship,

23:36.942 --> 23:40.076
I just kept going the way
it was headed and found that.

23:40.111 --> 23:41.811
Good thinking, Ben.

23:41.845 --> 23:44.447
They're not using any
kind of engine I've ever seen.

23:44.481 --> 23:47.049
It's some kind of
organic biotechnology.

23:47.084 --> 23:50.586
Captain, we really should try and
grab as much of this wreck as we can.

23:50.620 --> 23:52.588
I mean, we could learn a lot.
It's a bad time for a science project.

23:52.622 --> 23:54.123
It's a bad time
for everything,

23:54.157 --> 23:56.459
but we need to know all we can
about our enemies.

23:56.493 --> 23:58.194
Once we get over there, you can
take the truck, grab what you want.

23:58.228 --> 23:59.796
And we'll hightail it
into the forest,

23:59.830 --> 24:02.833
get away from that base.

24:02.867 --> 24:04.084
We're not going anywhere
if we don't figure out how

24:04.109 --> 24:05.769
to shut down the air power.

24:05.770 --> 24:08.872
Now, we see anything in these
pictures that can help us do that?

24:08.907 --> 24:12.009
No pilot.
No.

24:12.043 --> 24:15.678
No, uh, seats, no controls --
nothing for any kind of pilot.

24:15.713 --> 24:18.547
Ben, did you see anything
that looked like a radio?

24:18.582 --> 24:20.549
Did you hear anything?

24:20.584 --> 24:21.717
No.

24:21.751 --> 24:23.719
Well,
if they're drones,

24:23.753 --> 24:25.276
they got to get their commands
from somewhere, right?

24:25.301 --> 24:26.554
Yeah.

24:26.555 --> 24:28.890
I mean,
it's most likely this base.

24:28.924 --> 24:32.092
Yeah, this big
flyswatter-looking thing

24:32.127 --> 24:35.596
is probably
their communications antenna.

24:35.630 --> 24:37.598
The best way to take down
the air power -- blow that up.

24:37.632 --> 24:39.766
Which is exactly
what you'll do.

24:39.800 --> 24:40.867
Yes, sir.

24:40.902 --> 24:42.569
You take your unit
in the boat,

24:42.603 --> 24:44.270
infiltrate that base,
smash that antenna.

24:44.305 --> 24:46.005
That'll keep those Beamers
off of us

24:46.039 --> 24:47.773
long enough
to get across the bridge.

24:47.808 --> 24:49.741
Those Mechs aren't just
gonna step aside

24:49.776 --> 24:51.844
while we walk in
with a suitcase full of C-4.

24:51.878 --> 24:53.279
That's why you're gonna have to
find a way

24:53.313 --> 24:55.047
to get close enough
to take a shot.

24:55.082 --> 24:57.917
We'll rendezvous with you
on the other side of the bridge.

24:57.952 --> 24:59.185
Anthony?

24:59.220 --> 25:01.655
You, Pope,
and the Berserkers

25:01.689 --> 25:03.757
will stay here
and cover our asses.

25:03.791 --> 25:06.727
Now, you see those Skitter
and Mech columns moving in,

25:06.761 --> 25:08.629
you kick them in the teeth,
and you run like hell,

25:08.663 --> 25:10.664
'cause once we get across,
we're gonna blow that bridge.

25:10.699 --> 25:12.900
Roger that.

25:15.837 --> 25:17.504
It's a scientific fact --

25:17.571 --> 25:20.173
dirt mixed with sweat
makes you waterproof.

25:20.240 --> 25:21.941
Tector,
I don't give a rat's ass

25:21.975 --> 25:24.509
if it makes you fireproof,
you stink

25:24.577 --> 25:26.811
so bad you could gag a dog
off a gut wagon.

25:26.846 --> 25:28.513
When we get to the other side
of that river,

25:28.581 --> 25:30.515
either you take a scrub
and a hot bath

25:30.582 --> 25:32.183
or me and the boys
will give you one.

25:32.251 --> 25:33.952
You'll pay hell
getting it done.

25:33.986 --> 25:37.189
Think of all
the Skitters we've blown away.

25:37.256 --> 25:39.658
They got to reproduce
to keep their numbers up.

25:39.692 --> 25:42.828
Yeah, I wonder how they do it.

25:42.862 --> 25:44.196
Maybe they're
hermaphrodites.

25:44.263 --> 25:47.966
What, like earthworms?
No way.

25:48.000 --> 25:51.203
You've become
quite the mechanic.

25:51.271 --> 25:54.973
Yeah. A little different
from working on my mom's hybrid.

25:55.008 --> 25:57.676
Uh, be careful tonight.

25:57.710 --> 25:59.844
Things could get pretty hot
out there.

25:59.879 --> 26:03.114
Ah.
I'm looking forward to it.

26:03.148 --> 26:05.116
You know,
when I was a -- a kid,

26:05.150 --> 26:08.218
my dad got me the biggest Lego
collection, outside of Legoland.

26:08.286 --> 26:10.554
I used to build cities
in my basement --

26:10.622 --> 26:12.590
Ferris wheels
and cable cars.

26:12.625 --> 26:15.026
Wish I could have seen that.

26:15.061 --> 26:16.996
You think
they mate for life?

26:17.030 --> 26:19.078
No. They got to have
multiple sex partners.

26:20.301 --> 26:22.369
So you think Skitters
sleep around, huh?

26:22.404 --> 26:24.038
How do you know
for certain?

26:24.072 --> 26:26.241
Well, think of all the critters
in our world.

26:26.308 --> 26:27.842
Very few mate for life.

26:27.877 --> 26:29.711
The best hope
for survival

26:29.746 --> 26:33.148
is to hook up anyone healthy
enough to enrich the gene pool.

26:33.182 --> 26:35.584
We still talking
about Skitters?

26:37.753 --> 26:41.156
Wag it and shag it, people.
Let's move.

26:41.190 --> 26:44.025
- Oh. You get that law rocket?
- Yeah, I'm on it.

26:44.059 --> 26:45.660
Nice. Hey, Matt.

26:45.694 --> 26:47.895
Come on, buddy.
You're riding on the med bus.

26:47.930 --> 26:49.363
Dad's there.

26:49.398 --> 26:51.098
Exactly. I need you to look
after him for me, all right?

26:51.166 --> 26:54.035
Go mount up.
Thanks, Matt.

26:56.171 --> 27:00.409
So, uh, I guess I'll see you
on the other --

27:04.848 --> 27:06.115
Bye.

27:09.186 --> 27:14.891
Hold on, Tom. This old girl
isn't exactly a luxury ride.

27:17.194 --> 27:20.897
Hey, Matt.
Glad you're riding with us.

27:20.931 --> 27:22.798
Yeah.

27:29.038 --> 27:32.174
Let's go!
Let's move!

27:34.143 --> 27:36.279
Here we go!

28:33.166 --> 28:36.168
Time to move.
Come on.

28:57.892 --> 29:00.026
All right.

29:07.767 --> 29:10.802
Captain!
We're in business!

29:10.837 --> 29:13.805
- Let's fire them up! Let's go!
- Let's roll!

29:13.839 --> 29:15.740
Let's roll!

29:32.994 --> 29:35.829
Let's roll!

29:41.136 --> 29:42.837
Let's roll!

29:42.871 --> 29:44.939
Easy, easy, easy!

29:55.617 --> 29:58.453
I wish we had
a bigger rocket.

29:58.487 --> 29:59.487
I hear that.

30:10.034 --> 30:13.037
Let's go.
We don't have all night.

30:18.510 --> 30:21.745
You haven't said a word
since you got on the bus.

30:21.780 --> 30:23.881
What's going on,
Matt?

30:23.915 --> 30:25.182
Nothing.

30:25.216 --> 30:27.484
I'm still your Dad,
you know?

30:27.518 --> 30:28.952
If you say so.

30:28.986 --> 30:32.688
You've got to believe I'd never
do anything to hurt you.

30:32.723 --> 30:35.591
That thing
that came out of you...

30:36.860 --> 30:39.862
...how do you know it didn't
do something to you?

30:39.896 --> 30:41.864
Honestly, I don't know.

30:41.898 --> 30:43.599
That's why
I've got this --

30:43.633 --> 30:45.868
just to be safe,
just to be sure.

30:45.902 --> 30:49.604
But what I do know in my heart
is that you're my son.

30:49.639 --> 30:51.906
You're my Matt...

30:51.940 --> 30:53.875
a brave, strong boy.

30:53.909 --> 30:56.878
I'd never, ever
let anything happen to you,

30:56.912 --> 30:59.580
even if that means me having
to be tied up like this.

30:59.614 --> 31:02.115
You understand?

31:03.751 --> 31:05.919
Sounds like
Pope made contact.

31:05.953 --> 31:09.054
Means those Skitter and Mech
columns will hit the bridge soon.

31:09.089 --> 31:10.923
That's bad news for Weaver,
but good news for us.

31:10.957 --> 31:12.024
Look at this.

31:16.797 --> 31:18.164
Those Mechs are headed
straight towards the firefight.

31:18.198 --> 31:20.166
The approach to the antenna's
wide open.

31:20.201 --> 31:22.536
You know what they say
about gift horses.

31:26.808 --> 31:27.908
Ben, what's wrong?

31:27.943 --> 31:29.243
They're coming
off the side.

31:29.277 --> 31:32.080
Get down!

31:33.849 --> 31:35.683
Damn. They'll be on the guys
in half a tick.

31:35.718 --> 31:38.686
Dai, how's it look?

31:38.721 --> 31:40.688
It's too far away.

31:40.722 --> 31:43.824
The probability's no better
than 50%.

31:43.858 --> 31:45.759
That's not good enough.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.235
Looks good.

31:59.807 --> 32:01.908
Oh!

32:01.943 --> 32:04.611
Everybody, take cover!

32:06.614 --> 32:08.115
What if he misses?

32:08.149 --> 32:10.117
We've only got
one of those things.

32:10.152 --> 32:11.853
He isn't gonna miss.

32:11.887 --> 32:13.622
Are you, brother?

32:14.357 --> 32:16.859
Tick, tick...

32:16.893 --> 32:18.093
Boom!
Boom!

32:41.315 --> 32:43.283
Signal's gone.

32:43.317 --> 32:47.019
Nice shot, brother.
Nice shot.

32:47.054 --> 32:49.755
All right, let's get back to
the bridge. Come on. Let's go.

32:59.866 --> 33:02.001
You gonna lie there
all night?

33:04.071 --> 33:08.174
You picked a great place
to take cover.

33:08.209 --> 33:11.445
You want to see
a pretty sight?

33:13.949 --> 33:17.184
I think Hal's team
knocked out that antenna.

33:17.218 --> 33:19.787
When their signal goes out,

33:19.821 --> 33:21.755
they're probably programmed
to fly home.

33:21.789 --> 33:23.790
Keep it up.

33:36.369 --> 33:39.771
Almost done.

33:47.846 --> 33:49.147
Better step it up, Cap!

33:49.214 --> 33:51.983
We got beaucoup Skitters
and Mechs right behind us.

33:56.154 --> 33:59.990
Non-essential personnel,
dismount!

34:00.024 --> 34:02.325
Go!
Over the bridge on foot now!

34:02.360 --> 34:03.660
Go!

34:03.727 --> 34:05.295
Move it!

34:05.329 --> 34:06.796
Go, go, go!

34:15.004 --> 34:16.138
Whoa!

34:17.407 --> 34:20.009
It's okay.
You're okay.

34:20.076 --> 34:22.078
Hang on to something.

34:43.502 --> 34:46.271
Matt, you got your pocketknife on you?
I need you to cut me loose.

34:46.304 --> 34:49.041
- But you said you might --
- Forget what I said. Come on. You can do it.

34:55.293 --> 34:57.250
Lourdes,
get to the other side now.

34:57.251 --> 34:59.818
Come on. On foot. Go!
Lourdes.

34:59.853 --> 35:02.820
Dr. Glass, is there any way
you can get out and hoof it.

35:02.855 --> 35:05.856
I can't leave the wounded.

35:05.891 --> 35:08.426
Come on, man. Please.

35:08.460 --> 35:10.394
That's it.
Just cut me loose.

35:10.429 --> 35:12.296
On the double!

35:12.330 --> 35:15.366
Get this bus out of here.

35:15.400 --> 35:18.034
Ready?
One, two, three.

35:18.069 --> 35:19.436
Go!

35:22.840 --> 35:26.042
Good boy.

35:31.215 --> 35:32.782
Tom!

35:32.817 --> 35:35.385
Get across the bridge!
Wait for Hal and Ben!

36:16.929 --> 36:19.298
Let's move!

36:19.332 --> 36:22.969
Go! Go! Go!
Get across! Come on!

36:23.003 --> 36:25.172
Go!

36:25.206 --> 36:27.107
Go now! Come on!

36:27.141 --> 36:28.975
Come on, what are you doing
out there?

36:29.010 --> 36:31.212
Run! Run, Ben!

36:37.151 --> 36:39.252
My dad's back there!
What?!

36:39.287 --> 36:41.388
And the Skitters and Mechs
are still coming!

36:43.391 --> 36:48.296
Tom, get the hell out of there!
We're gonna blow the bridge!

36:53.002 --> 36:54.402
Dad!

36:54.437 --> 36:56.305
Tom, run!

36:56.339 --> 36:58.340
Run, man!

37:01.245 --> 37:05.148
Blow the bridge!

37:05.183 --> 37:07.083
Tom, come on!
Come on!

37:07.118 --> 37:08.485
Blow the bridge!

37:08.519 --> 37:10.987
Get the hell out of there!

37:11.021 --> 37:13.255
Yo, we got Skitters and Mechs!
A lot of them!

37:13.290 --> 37:14.523
Hold it.

37:14.558 --> 37:15.625
Huh?
Jamil.

37:15.659 --> 37:17.294
Dad, come on!

37:17.328 --> 37:18.561
Do it now!

37:20.397 --> 37:22.365
Do it now!
Dad!

37:22.399 --> 37:24.300
- Jamil!
- Dad!

37:24.335 --> 37:26.435
Blow the bridge!

37:26.470 --> 37:28.037
Jamil!

37:28.071 --> 37:30.039
Ja--

37:30.073 --> 37:32.308
No!

37:38.548 --> 37:40.281
Dad!

37:40.316 --> 37:42.450
Hey, Hal, Hal! Hal, come on!
We're out of time!

37:42.484 --> 37:45.519
No!
We got no time, Hal. We got no time.

37:45.553 --> 37:47.521
Just come on.
Mount up!

37:47.555 --> 37:50.157
Move out!

37:50.191 --> 37:53.594
Go!

37:59.033 --> 38:01.534
Hey.

38:01.569 --> 38:03.536
Thanks.

38:03.571 --> 38:07.540
Come on.
Come on. We can do it.

38:13.580 --> 38:16.082
As soon as we get to
the next camp,

38:16.116 --> 38:19.051
you and I are going back
with a search party.

38:21.989 --> 38:24.657
How did we do?

38:27.661 --> 38:31.630
We lost three vehicles,
a food truck...

38:31.665 --> 38:33.965
and six of the finest fighters

38:34.000 --> 38:37.136
I've ever had the honor
to serve beside.

38:37.170 --> 38:41.574
But we did it.
Well done, people.

38:41.608 --> 38:45.310
Captain, we spotted an airport
about 5 miles west of here,

38:45.344 --> 38:47.345
and no sign
of alien activity.

38:47.380 --> 38:50.581
Sounds like a good place
to hole up, lick our wounds.

38:52.283 --> 38:54.551
You okay?

39:05.530 --> 39:09.233
You okay, pal?

39:09.267 --> 39:13.370
In the bus,
I stayed away from him.

39:13.404 --> 39:15.505
I was afraid.

39:15.540 --> 39:20.243
He understood,
I'm sure.

39:20.278 --> 39:22.513
Uh...

39:22.547 --> 39:25.649
listen, about your old man,
I just wanted to --

39:25.684 --> 39:27.551
you know, what he did
on the bridge back there.

39:27.586 --> 39:30.454
I got to admit he had
some pretty hard bark on him.

39:30.488 --> 39:32.656
Aah!
Whoa, pal!

39:35.460 --> 39:38.261
You saw a chance to frag him,
and you took it.

39:38.296 --> 39:40.164
You son of a bitch!

39:47.672 --> 39:49.640
Who's there?

39:49.675 --> 39:52.310
Don't shoot, Ben.

39:53.746 --> 39:56.181
Dad!

39:56.215 --> 39:58.116
Once is enough, I think.

40:07.493 --> 40:11.430
What took you so long?

40:11.464 --> 40:14.432
Dad.
The river sucked off one of my boots.

40:16.201 --> 40:18.436
Slowed down my stride.

40:18.470 --> 40:22.172
Tom Mason, I'm getting damn
tired of losing you.

40:22.207 --> 40:26.610
I'm gonna tie a cowbell
around your neck.

40:34.552 --> 40:37.253
All right.

40:37.288 --> 40:40.423
Let's get it in gear!

40:40.457 --> 40:44.326
I want to get to that airport
before daylight.
