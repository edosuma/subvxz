How'd you find me?

10:24.833 --> 10:26.875
It doesn't matter.

10:26.875 --> 10:29.000
It was Kirk, wasn't it?

What do you want?

10:41.000 --> 10:44.583
I don't need to want anything.

10:44.583 --> 10:45.333
I'm your father.

10:47.708 --> 10:49.250
Victor, huh?

10:49.250 --> 10:53.167
At least that's what
I said on my fake ID.

10:53.167 --> 10:56.542
Funny thing is it was your
mother's first choice.

10:56.542 --> 10:58.792
Her great grandfather's name.

10:58.792 --> 11:03.500
We ended up tossing a
coin, and Vincent won.

11:03.500 --> 11:04.875
Yeah.

11:04.875 --> 11:06.500
I know that story.

11:34.625 --> 11:36.250
I don't know.

11:36.250 --> 11:37.375
I mean--

11:37.375 --> 11:39.875
Kirk mentioned something
about an undercover cop.

11:39.875 --> 11:41.208
What about him?

11:41.208 --> 11:43.500
Man, it's me you're
talking to, OK?

11:43.500 --> 11:44.792
I'm not an attorney.

11:44.792 --> 11:46.792
And assume I already
know what happened.

11:46.792 --> 11:48.958
I just want to hear
your side of the story.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.625
Buddy and I we, ran
off with some cholo's

11:54.625 --> 11:56.458
payload over in East Hollywood.

12:00.625 --> 12:02.083
Security must have
tipped him off

12:02.083 --> 12:04.542
because his muscle caught
up with this pretty fast.

12:04.542 --> 12:05.667
Muscle was undercover.

12:05.667 --> 12:07.833
No, he's a fucking cop.

12:07.833 --> 12:09.167
Fuck, he was so dirty.

12:12.042 --> 12:14.667
Did you shoot the
police officer?

12:14.667 --> 12:17.625
What if I did?

12:17.625 --> 12:19.542
Yeah, it's not
like you don't have

12:19.542 --> 12:21.583
any experience killing people.

12:21.583 --> 12:22.792
That was different Vinny.

12:22.792 --> 12:23.833
That was a job.

12:23.833 --> 12:25.750
I had to put food on the table.

12:25.750 --> 12:29.000
Same fucking difference.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.500
Look, it's been fun, Alex.

12:31.500 --> 12:35.542
Just wait.

12:35.542 --> 12:37.750
Make it fucking quick then.

12:37.750 --> 12:38.667

12:38.667 --> 12:40.625

12:40.625 --> 12:42.292

12:42.292 --> 12:43.958
You think I'm stupid?

12:43.958 --> 12:47.583
I know I wasn't around
enough for you growing up.

12:47.583 --> 12:48.792
I know that.

12:48.792 --> 12:51.292
Come on, try ever.

12:51.292 --> 12:53.833
Well, I'm trying now.

12:53.833 --> 12:56.375
I'm trying now, Vinny.

12:56.375 --> 13:00.250
Now you had [inaudible]
fucking [? leave. ?]

13:00.250 --> 13:04.667
What are you going to do now,
especially now, now that I'm

13:04.667 --> 13:06.083
in here in you're out there?

13:06.083 --> 13:07.708
Listen, Vinny, how
many times do I

13:07.708 --> 13:09.000
have to go through
this with you?

13:09.000 --> 13:10.208
I've explained it.

13:10.208 --> 13:11.625
I have to tell it
you over and over.

13:11.625 --> 13:14.083
Yeah, you can explain
shit every time.

13:14.083 --> 13:17.417
Black Ops, top secret.

13:17.417 --> 13:20.042
So fucking cool.

13:20.042 --> 13:22.208
There comes a time when
you just heard enough.

13:22.208 --> 13:23.542
Hey, don't fucking touch me!

13:23.542 --> 13:24.167
Oh!

13:24.167 --> 13:24.542
Fuck!

13:24.542 --> 13:25.375
Oh!

13:25.375 --> 13:25.917
Shit.

13:25.917 --> 13:27.042
Fucking asshole.

13:27.042 --> 13:28.750
What the fuck was
paying for, man?

13:34.375 --> 13:37.333
Too fucking cool.

13:37.333 --> 13:39.667
All I'd ever do
at school is talk

13:39.667 --> 13:41.917
about how fucking cool you are.

13:41.917 --> 13:44.750
I had my prom date
asking, where's your dad?

13:44.750 --> 13:51.083
But the real kicker is when
your mom is on her deathbed,

13:51.083 --> 13:55.917
and she's begging to see her
husband just one last time.

13:55.917 --> 13:58.875
And all I could
do was lie to her.

13:58.875 --> 14:01.000
That's all I could do.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.083
Tell her, hey, no, no.

14:02.083 --> 14:04.750
He's on-- he's on the way.

14:04.750 --> 14:05.625
He's coming.

14:05.625 --> 14:06.917
He's going to be here.

14:06.917 --> 14:09.208
You just hang on there
a little bit longer.

14:09.208 --> 14:11.917
You skip holding her
hand, nice and firm.

14:11.917 --> 14:13.708
You know, like what
it means to be there

14:13.708 --> 14:19.417
until finally I just felt her
stop holding my hand back.

14:23.625 --> 14:25.833
That should have been you!

14:25.833 --> 14:27.375
Hey, watch it.

14:27.375 --> 14:30.125
Settle down.

14:30.125 --> 14:31.458
That should have been you.

14:36.417 --> 14:46.417
I'm-- I'm sorry, Vinny.

14:46.417 --> 14:47.958
I'm really sorry.

14:47.958 --> 14:51.083
You don't even know what
that word fucking means.

14:53.583 --> 14:54.792
Vinny.

14:54.792 --> 14:55.958
[crying]

14:59.583 --> 15:00.917
So what?

15:00.917 --> 15:04.500
You think you can just
get me out of here, hmm?

15:04.500 --> 15:05.417
You really think so?

15:08.458 --> 15:10.083
There's no such
thing as a guarantee.

15:10.083 --> 15:13.000
I'm not playing these
fucking games anymore.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.375
Come on, Vinny.

15:14.375 --> 15:17.750
Why don't you just
fucking leave.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.333
Leave!

15:19.333 --> 15:19.917
Leave!

15:23.833 --> 15:26.833
Fuck you.

15:26.833 --> 15:27.583
Fuck you.

[music playing]

15:34.750 --> 15:38.333

15:50.083 --> 15:55.500
Yeah, I can't wait
to get out of here.

15:55.500 --> 15:56.625
Let's get this going.

15:56.625 --> 15:58.542
We have 10 more after this one.

15:58.542 --> 16:02.083
[music playing]

16:03.292 --> 16:07.958
Inmate 201693, Maximilian
Ezekiel Chandler.

16:11.750 --> 16:13.375
You certify that this is you?

16:16.375 --> 16:17.292
That's me.

16:19.875 --> 16:21.708
Warden.

16:21.708 --> 16:22.333
Chandler.

16:26.250 --> 16:28.125
How's the stab wound?

16:28.125 --> 16:30.583
Healed up nicely.

16:30.583 --> 16:32.083
How's the taser marks?

16:32.083 --> 16:33.583
[chuckles]

16:34.750 --> 16:37.167
Sergeant Baker, nice of
you to join us today.

16:37.167 --> 16:38.958
I wouldn't miss
this for the world.

16:38.958 --> 16:41.417
But it's such a beautiful world.

16:41.417 --> 16:42.583
It is.

16:42.583 --> 16:46.083
It's be much more beautiful
without you in it.

16:46.083 --> 16:47.583
You know, considering
our history,

16:47.583 --> 16:49.917
I thought maybe you might have
something perhaps a little

16:49.917 --> 16:51.917
less cliche to contribute.

16:51.917 --> 16:53.583
Can we continue, please?

16:53.583 --> 16:54.833
Yes, of course.

16:54.833 --> 16:55.750
How rude of me.

16:55.750 --> 16:57.583
Please.

16:57.583 --> 17:00.792
You are here to determine if
you're eligible for parole

17:00.792 --> 17:03.250
based on past time served.

17:03.250 --> 17:06.791
You were tried for four separate
terrorist bombings resulting

17:06.791 --> 17:07.625
in numerous deaths.

17:07.625 --> 17:08.291
Four.

17:08.291 --> 17:09.583
I told them it was 15.

17:09.583 --> 17:11.875
Well, cops rarely do
their due diligence,

17:11.875 --> 17:13.958
isn't that right, sergeant?

17:13.958 --> 17:16.833
You have been in
four fights resulting

17:16.833 --> 17:18.583
in the deaths of three inmates.

17:18.583 --> 17:21.333
You had your aforementioned
encounter with the warden

17:21.333 --> 17:25.000
here and pulled out
another inmate's eyeball

17:25.000 --> 17:27.166
from the socket
while he was alive.

17:27.166 --> 17:29.875
I guess I needed it.

17:29.875 --> 17:33.208
Mr. Chandler, why on earth
would we approve you for parole?

17:35.875 --> 17:37.875
I found Jesus.

17:37.875 --> 17:40.792
Do you think that
erases your crime?

17:40.792 --> 17:42.417
No.

17:42.417 --> 17:45.625
Then why do you deserve parole?

17:45.625 --> 17:49.958
Well, because I'm more dangerous
inside than I am outside.

17:49.958 --> 17:53.542
[music playing]

18:07.833 --> 18:09.333
Have you watched
the news lately?

18:11.542 --> 18:13.375
The world is reaching
a boiling point.

18:13.375 --> 18:16.208
And keeping revolutionaries
such as myself locked up just

18:16.208 --> 18:18.958
turns up the heat.

18:18.958 --> 18:20.417
You know, I never
expected my art

18:20.417 --> 18:23.292
to be so broadly
accepted by small minds.

18:23.292 --> 18:27.625
So I forgive you for that.

18:27.625 --> 18:29.375
OH.

18:29.375 --> 18:32.708
OK, I think that's enough.

18:32.708 --> 18:34.750
I vote his ass stays here.

18:34.750 --> 18:35.792
Second.

18:35.792 --> 18:36.792
Unanimous.

18:36.792 --> 18:39.375
He stays here.

18:39.375 --> 18:41.375
Any parting words, Mr. Chandler?

18:41.375 --> 18:42.083
Yes.

18:42.083 --> 18:44.875
Do you have the time?

18:44.875 --> 18:46.125
It's 12:57.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.333
You're going to be
late to lunch if you

18:47.333 --> 18:49.375
don't make this one quick.

18:49.375 --> 18:51.250
Looks like we still
have a few minutes then.

18:51.250 --> 18:52.750
A few minutes before what?

18:52.750 --> 18:54.042
Don't listen to this shit.

18:54.042 --> 18:55.083
Stop.

18:55.083 --> 18:57.542
I'm not done talking.

18:58.542 --> 18:59.500
You know, Sergeant.

19:00.917 --> 19:03.042
I'm truly sorry.

19:03.042 --> 19:06.375
I'm sorry that you spent a
decade of your life tracking

19:06.375 --> 19:07.417
me down.

19:07.417 --> 19:09.500
I am sorry that
your wife left you

19:09.500 --> 19:10.917
and your kids don't
want to see you.

19:10.917 --> 19:14.083
And I'm sorry you're such
a shitty cop that not even

19:14.083 --> 19:15.667
drinking helps you
sleep at night.

19:15.667 --> 19:16.667
Ouch, Max.

19:16.667 --> 19:20.167
[music playing]

19:28.500 --> 19:33.125
And you, I'm sorry you do
such a horrible job running

19:33.125 --> 19:35.917
this place-- should be torn
down and turned into a shopping

19:35.917 --> 19:37.250
mall.

19:37.250 --> 19:38.542
And I'm truly sorry I
stabbed you in the neck.

19:38.542 --> 19:40.333
What are you wasting
our time for, Chandler?

19:40.333 --> 19:43.083
Who says I'm wasting
anyone's time?

19:43.083 --> 19:46.667
[pa announcement]

19:55.458 --> 19:58.958
I almost forgot your
partner, Williams.

19:58.958 --> 20:01.958
Is he still eating all
his meals through a tube?

20:01.958 --> 20:04.167
[gun shot]

20:04.167 --> 20:05.750
What's the time?

20:05.750 --> 20:08.292
The time?

20:08.292 --> 20:09.208
It's 1:00.

20:09.208 --> 20:12.792
[dramatic music]

20:21.667 --> 20:25.250
[beeping]

20:26.625 --> 20:30.208
[explosion]

20:31.958 --> 20:35.542
[dramatic music]

20:42.917 --> 20:46.833
I'm done with them.

20:46.833 --> 20:47.792
Don't.

20:47.792 --> 20:48.167
No!

20:48.167 --> 20:48.792
No!

20:48.792 --> 20:49.333
No!

20:49.333 --> 20:52.708
[gun shots]

20:52.708 --> 20:56.292
[music continues]

21:11.833 --> 21:14.625
[rap music]

21:14.625 --> 21:16.625
Those ain't earthquakes, is it?

21:16.625 --> 21:17.333
Nah.

21:17.333 --> 21:18.208
That was no earthquake.

21:18.208 --> 21:19.708
I can't override it.

21:19.708 --> 21:20.375
This is bad.

21:20.375 --> 21:21.542
I'm going out.

21:21.542 --> 21:23.667
Copy you on your six.

21:23.667 --> 21:25.917
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

21:25.917 --> 21:27.083
I'm the next shift.

21:27.083 --> 21:28.667
[gunfire]

21:36.208 --> 21:38.375
Max, you copy?

21:38.375 --> 21:39.667
I hear you, Luke.

21:39.667 --> 21:41.083
Well done.

21:41.083 --> 21:42.500
That's what I do.

21:42.500 --> 21:44.250
Time for phase two.

21:44.250 --> 21:47.042
Test, test.

21:47.042 --> 21:47.667
Test, test.

21:53.167 --> 21:56.208
Good afternoon,
my fellow inmates.

21:56.208 --> 21:57.250
Max Chandler speaking.

21:57.250 --> 21:59.083
[grunts]

21:59.083 --> 22:02.958
I'm here to inform me that I am
now in control of Mount Vernon

22:02.958 --> 22:03.583
prison.

22:03.583 --> 22:04.917
Ah!

22:04.917 --> 22:07.875
And I'm here to offer you
a chance to get freedom.

22:07.875 --> 22:10.875
You can either choose to
stay here under my command

22:10.875 --> 22:17.000
until our demands are met,
or you are free to go.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.667
My men will not stop you.

22:19.667 --> 22:22.333
There is no punishment for
taking your freedom back.

22:22.333 --> 22:26.917
So go, fly, be free.

22:26.917 --> 22:29.417
And if you choose to
stay here, my demand

22:29.417 --> 22:31.750
will now be your demands.

22:34.083 --> 22:37.500
And for those of you who are
either here visiting loved ones

22:37.500 --> 22:41.333
or working here
for minimum wage,

22:41.333 --> 22:43.833
my men are coming
for your phones,

22:43.833 --> 22:46.000
and to escort you
to the cafeteria

22:46.000 --> 22:49.083
where you will be held under
gunpoint till this is over.

22:51.917 --> 22:56.125
And if any of you try
to play hero tonight,

22:56.125 --> 22:59.125
you will be executed
immediately.

22:59.125 --> 23:02.458
[commotion]

23:02.458 --> 23:04.083
Aye, this fool series?

23:04.083 --> 23:05.208
Guess we'll fucking see.

23:05.208 --> 23:06.708
That's Max Chandler, man.

23:06.708 --> 23:10.167
Can't follow this
crazy son of a bitch.

23:10.167 --> 23:11.792
Man, I don't know about this.

23:11.792 --> 23:15.333
[commotion]

23:17.125 --> 23:18.958
It's like music, isn't it?

23:27.458 --> 23:28.458
I need a phone.

23:33.167 --> 23:33.792
[sighs]

23:38.792 --> 23:41.667
Local news.

23:41.667 --> 23:46.000
Associated Foreign Press, FBI.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
[chuckles]

23:47.958 --> 23:49.167
Whom am I forgetting?

23:49.167 --> 23:50.708
What are you doing?

23:50.708 --> 23:52.667
Making our demands known.

23:56.958 --> 23:58.500
[inaudible] invitation.

23:58.500 --> 24:00.833
You film me.

24:00.833 --> 24:01.375
Come here.

24:01.375 --> 24:02.958
Get my best.

24:02.958 --> 24:03.875
[clears throat]

24:08.458 --> 24:09.375
OK.

24:09.375 --> 24:09.958
Ready.

24:14.292 --> 24:17.500
Max Chandler here.

24:17.500 --> 24:19.417
For those of you
that don't know me,

24:19.417 --> 24:23.833
I am currently incarcerated in
Val Verde State Penitentiary

24:23.833 --> 24:28.042
in California for planting
and detonating bombs

24:28.042 --> 24:32.375
in churches and government
buildings 12 years ago.

24:32.375 --> 24:35.000
I'm here to tell you that I
am now in control of Val Verde

24:35.000 --> 24:38.208
prison, and I would like for you
to hear the warden's thoughts

24:38.208 --> 24:39.625
on this.

24:39.625 --> 24:49.083
But he's coming off long
shift, and he's dead tired.

24:49.083 --> 24:53.542
I'll have that I've granted the
other prisoners their freedom.

24:53.542 --> 24:55.083
Good luck in finding them.

24:55.083 --> 24:58.167
And I can assure you that if
my forthcoming demands are not

24:58.167 --> 25:01.042
met, then I will destroy
the rest of this prison

25:01.042 --> 25:03.708
with all the hostages
remaining inside.

25:03.708 --> 25:06.333
And my demands are simple.

25:06.333 --> 25:10.167
Release the six remaining
members of the Trier crime

25:10.167 --> 25:13.208
family and provide an
escort to a country

25:13.208 --> 25:17.083
that has no extradition
to the United States.

25:17.083 --> 25:19.792
Once I receive word
of their safety

25:19.792 --> 25:22.375
in a helicopter
of my own, I will

25:22.375 --> 25:27.458
release my control of Val Verde
and defuse any remaining bombs

25:27.458 --> 25:31.125
that remain on the grounds.

25:31.125 --> 25:32.292
You have six hours.

25:47.125 --> 25:50.167
Hey, what the hell
happened in here?

25:50.167 --> 25:51.167
What's going on?

25:51.167 --> 25:52.083
What are you doing in here?

25:55.375 --> 25:55.958
Smith?

26:02.333 --> 26:03.458
Yeah, that's right.

26:03.458 --> 26:04.500
Why the fuck are
you still in here?

26:04.500 --> 26:05.417
We evacuated the building.

26:05.417 --> 26:06.792
Hey, man, take it easy.

26:06.792 --> 26:08.750
I was in the bathroom when
the explosion went off.

26:08.750 --> 26:10.875
Hurt my shoulder
pretty fucking bad.

26:10.875 --> 26:12.625
I didn't hear no
evacuation notice.

26:12.625 --> 26:14.250
Probably because
you were unconscious

26:14.250 --> 26:15.208
from the explosions.

26:15.208 --> 26:16.833
I wasn't unconscious.

26:16.833 --> 26:19.167
Who was that on the intercom?

26:19.167 --> 26:20.500
One of the prisoners.

26:20.500 --> 26:22.292
He's responsible for
all the explosions.

26:22.292 --> 26:23.167
No shit.

26:23.167 --> 26:24.083
Yeah.

26:24.083 --> 26:25.167
Yeah, no shit.

26:25.167 --> 26:26.208
OK.

26:26.208 --> 26:27.458
Well, look, I need
to get out of here.

26:27.458 --> 26:28.708
I got to get to the hospital.

26:28.708 --> 26:30.333
I hurt my shoulder
pretty fucking bad, man.

26:30.333 --> 26:32.625
Which is the way out?

26:32.625 --> 26:33.583
Just follow me.

26:33.583 --> 26:34.333
This way?

26:34.333 --> 26:35.042
Yeah, this way.

26:39.500 --> 26:42.667
So Smith, you've got family
that work in the building?

26:42.667 --> 26:44.083
Why do you ask?

26:44.083 --> 26:45.417
Just the two guys that
checked me in this morning,

26:45.417 --> 26:46.667
they were called Smith as well.

26:46.667 --> 26:50.750
It's a pretty common last name.

26:50.750 --> 26:52.875
I used to hate it
when I was a kid.

26:52.875 --> 26:53.417
Fuck!

26:53.417 --> 26:54.708
[gun shots]

26:54.708 --> 26:58.250
[dramatic music]

27:01.583 --> 27:05.167
[struggling]

27:17.417 --> 27:20.708
Now we heard shots.

27:20.708 --> 27:23.208
Smith, status.

27:23.208 --> 27:25.792
Yeah, there was a straggler,
but I took care of everything.

27:25.792 --> 27:28.250
Everything's under control.

27:28.250 --> 27:29.375
Good.

27:29.375 --> 27:30.333
Hey, don't fuck
around next time.

27:32.750 --> 27:33.500
Understood.

27:33.500 --> 27:36.917
[music playing]

27:46.625 --> 27:47.708

[helicopter whirring]

28:10.583 --> 28:13.125
[police radio chatter]

28:15.250 --> 28:17.792
I didn't expect to see you
here so soon after the incident

28:17.792 --> 28:18.542
downtown.

28:18.542 --> 28:19.292
Me neither.

28:19.292 --> 28:20.750
So what we got?

28:20.750 --> 28:21.708
You went briefed?

28:21.708 --> 28:23.042
I think, I'm refreshed.

28:23.042 --> 28:24.042
Get my [? fear ?] out
[? my uniform, ?] yeah?

28:24.042 --> 28:25.167
Yeah.

28:25.167 --> 28:26.792
Well, we got explosions
on the east south wings

28:26.792 --> 28:28.000
of the facility.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.250
Got the blast covered
for now, but not

28:29.250 --> 28:30.792
before a few of the
prisoners escaped.

28:30.792 --> 28:31.625
How many?

28:31.625 --> 28:33.083
Handful.

28:33.083 --> 28:34.667
Enough to keep the department
and Highway Patrol busy.

28:34.667 --> 28:37.333
Got a few arrests already, and
I'm sure more coming in soon.

28:37.333 --> 28:39.083
Who's responsible, huh?

28:39.083 --> 28:41.667
Former LAPD bomb
squad Max Chandler.

28:45.458 --> 28:46.083
Luke!

28:48.458 --> 28:50.208
Always good to see
you, my friend.

28:50.208 --> 28:51.458
How's the family?

28:51.458 --> 28:52.958
As well as could be expected.

28:52.958 --> 28:55.500
Hmm, what do we have here?

28:55.500 --> 28:58.333
New recruits.

28:58.333 --> 28:59.000
New recruits.

29:01.333 --> 29:03.750
So you chose me over
freedom, is that right?

29:03.750 --> 29:05.792
Yes, sir.

29:05.792 --> 29:06.958
Oh, boy.

29:10.000 --> 29:10.750
What's your name?

29:10.750 --> 29:13.292
Rico Walker.

29:13.292 --> 29:15.333
I'll do anything
you ask me to do.

29:15.333 --> 29:16.333
Hmm.

29:16.333 --> 29:17.292
Anything, huh?

29:20.667 --> 29:23.250
Yeah.

29:23.250 --> 29:23.833
Mm.

29:27.208 --> 29:30.792
[blood gushing]

29:39.708 --> 29:43.292
[laughs]

29:44.083 --> 29:46.000
What the fuck, Chandler?

29:46.000 --> 29:49.875
Any more kiss-asses?

29:49.875 --> 29:51.875
Never trust the first
motherfucker to speak up,

29:51.875 --> 29:53.042
you understand me?

29:57.125 --> 29:58.875
Apparently, there's
an armory in here

29:58.875 --> 30:00.792
to prevent this sort of
thing from happening.

30:00.792 --> 30:04.667
Does anybody happen
to know where it is?

30:04.667 --> 30:05.458
Anybody?

30:11.667 --> 30:14.375
You do.

30:14.375 --> 30:16.208
What's your name?

30:16.208 --> 30:16.792
Vincent.

30:19.167 --> 30:21.083
Yeah, maybe if you
don't kill anyone else,

30:21.083 --> 30:22.542
I could lead us all to it.

30:22.542 --> 30:25.917
Hmm, interesting.

30:25.917 --> 30:28.583
Well it looks like
our new friend here

30:28.583 --> 30:30.917
will escort you to the armory.

30:30.917 --> 30:34.542
So if you're not
armed, get armed.

30:39.750 --> 30:42.167
Follow me.

30:42.167 --> 30:44.708
Can one of the
Smiths get up here

30:44.708 --> 30:46.583
and pick up three dead bodies?

30:46.583 --> 30:47.208
Copy.

30:50.208 --> 30:50.875
Nice.

30:50.875 --> 30:54.417
[music playing]

31:09.958 --> 31:11.542
[inaudible]

31:11.542 --> 31:12.458
Oh, my kids do that.

31:12.458 --> 31:12.917
Sure.

31:12.917 --> 31:14.458
[laughs]

31:15.417 --> 31:18.042
Hey, this is Officer
Chaz Coleman.

31:18.042 --> 31:20.292
Now, it's my understanding
that the man who set off

31:20.292 --> 31:22.625
the explosives in
your prison has also

31:22.625 --> 31:24.625
said that you could go free.

31:24.625 --> 31:26.417
He's full of shit.

31:26.417 --> 31:29.833
Any inmate who was apprehended
off of prison grounds

31:29.833 --> 31:32.958
will face severe repercussions.

31:32.958 --> 31:34.792
Now I understand--

31:34.792 --> 31:37.417
I understand what
your demands are.

31:37.417 --> 31:40.583
But please know that this
is going to take some time.

31:40.583 --> 31:44.042
We can't just set prisoners
free, do you understand me?

31:44.042 --> 31:47.583
[music playing]

31:48.958 --> 31:50.500
[gun shots]

32:01.000 --> 32:02.542
Welcome to the
party, Mr. Coleman.

32:05.042 --> 32:06.833
That was one of
the prison doctors.

32:06.833 --> 32:08.542
It's a bullet to the
back of his head.

32:11.458 --> 32:16.000
Does that give you an idea
the speed I need you working?

32:16.000 --> 32:17.792
That definitely does.

32:17.792 --> 32:18.667
That definitely does.

32:18.667 --> 32:19.292
Thank you.

32:23.417 --> 32:24.042
Thank you.

32:24.042 --> 32:24.958
[phone ringing]

32:24.958 --> 32:25.542
Get it.

32:29.917 --> 32:30.917
Yeah.

32:30.917 --> 32:32.667
Yeah, I got him right here.

32:32.667 --> 32:33.375
It's for you.

32:33.375 --> 32:34.042
What?

32:34.042 --> 32:34.875
Somebody on the inside.

32:34.875 --> 32:35.792
Hostage?

32:35.792 --> 32:36.542
I don't think so.

32:36.542 --> 32:37.542
OK.

32:37.542 --> 32:38.667
Can you anyone one
to crack on this?

32:38.667 --> 32:39.417
Yeah.

32:39.417 --> 32:39.583
Yeah, I'm on it.

32:42.958 --> 32:44.083
This is Coleman.

32:44.083 --> 32:46.458
Don't give him what he wants.

32:46.458 --> 32:47.500
I'm sorry?

32:47.500 --> 32:49.042
Who am I speaking to?

32:49.042 --> 32:50.167
Don't worry about who I am.

32:50.167 --> 32:52.042
Just know you got
a friend inside.

32:52.042 --> 32:53.833
Well, maybe you don't
want to be my friend, huh?

32:53.833 --> 32:56.375
You want to send you a picture
of the man I just killed?

32:56.375 --> 32:57.542
Maybe some other time, you know.

32:57.542 --> 32:58.458
I'll have to take
your word for it.

32:58.458 --> 32:59.792
[chuckles]

32:59.792 --> 33:01.500
The man I just killed was
wearing a corrections officer

33:01.500 --> 33:02.750
uniform.

33:02.750 --> 33:05.958
they supposedly moved the
hostages to the cafeteria.

33:05.958 --> 33:09.333
I've yet to see a
single one of them.

33:09.333 --> 33:12.417
I'm afraid some of them
may have been killed.

33:12.417 --> 33:13.417
Who are you?

33:13.417 --> 33:16.042
An employee?

33:16.042 --> 33:18.833
I'm the janitor.

33:18.833 --> 33:20.125
Taking applications?

33:20.125 --> 33:21.500
[phone hangs up]

33:21.500 --> 33:22.750
Bad joke, huh?

33:22.750 --> 33:23.583
Did you get it?

33:23.583 --> 33:24.292
We're working on it.

33:24.292 --> 33:26.417
All right, we'll get it.

33:26.417 --> 33:28.583
Son of a bitch.

33:28.583 --> 33:31.583
So I'd kicked that dirty
hippie out of my house.

33:31.583 --> 33:33.500
That's your place.

33:33.500 --> 33:36.542
[? any ?] [? sort, ?] so
my girlfriend asked me,

33:36.542 --> 33:38.792
so are you fucking
somebody behind my back?

33:38.792 --> 33:39.625
Yeah.

33:39.625 --> 33:40.417
What did you say?

33:40.417 --> 33:41.250
I said, yeah.

33:41.250 --> 33:43.250
Who the fuck you think it is?

33:43.250 --> 33:43.792
Right?

33:43.792 --> 33:44.417
Right?

33:44.417 --> 33:45.417
[laughs]

33:45.417 --> 33:45.917
Dumb bitch.

33:45.917 --> 33:47.208
[laughs]

33:47.208 --> 33:48.708
Hey, [inaudible]

33:48.708 --> 33:49.750
Got to take a piss.

33:49.750 --> 33:50.792
You're going to be OK out here?

33:50.792 --> 33:52.167
Hurry up, man.

33:52.167 --> 33:54.458
[inaudible] flashbacks
about the prison showers?

33:54.458 --> 33:55.458
That obvious?

33:55.458 --> 33:56.792
Without you saying something.

33:56.792 --> 33:58.292
Hurry the fuck up, man.

33:58.292 --> 33:59.292
Hold up, hold up.

33:59.292 --> 34:01.042
I'll be right out.

34:01.042 --> 34:02.083
Keep it together.

34:09.500 --> 34:11.292
Come on, man.

34:11.292 --> 34:13.250
Hurry the fuck up.

34:13.250 --> 34:14.833
You need to hold
your horses, kid.

34:14.833 --> 34:18.458
It takes me a full minute and
a half to get this behemoth out

34:18.458 --> 34:19.583
of my pants.

34:19.583 --> 34:21.792
Something you'd
have no idea about.

34:21.792 --> 34:25.167
[grunting]

34:25.167 --> 34:27.333
[blood gushing]

34:28.125 --> 34:30.917
[toilet flushes]

34:30.917 --> 34:33.833
Look, kid, I don't want you
to get all bent out of shape

34:33.833 --> 34:35.417
about what I said
about your mom.

34:39.750 --> 34:40.958
I was just joking about that.

34:40.958 --> 34:41.833
Wasn't being honest.

34:47.708 --> 34:49.125
What the fuck?

34:49.125 --> 34:50.083
[gun shot]

34:50.083 --> 34:50.833
[body drops]

34:50.833 --> 34:54.208
[music playing]

34:59.917 --> 35:00.958
What's your name, kid?

35:00.958 --> 35:01.667
Freddie.

35:01.667 --> 35:02.458
OK, Freddie.

35:02.458 --> 35:03.250
Listen to me very carefully.

35:03.250 --> 35:04.625
Get out of here.

35:13.750 --> 35:16.542
Jackpot, motherfuckers.

35:16.542 --> 35:17.542
Oh.

35:17.542 --> 35:19.000
Now, we're going to
fuck some shit up.

35:19.000 --> 35:19.833
Woo!

35:19.833 --> 35:22.167
Check the shotgun.

35:22.167 --> 35:23.208
You take a shotgun.

35:27.083 --> 35:29.583
You got a gun.

35:29.583 --> 35:31.208
No.

35:31.208 --> 35:32.208
Just keeping an eye out.

35:32.208 --> 35:33.292
If y'all lead, I'll follow.

35:33.292 --> 35:34.333
All right, bro.

35:34.333 --> 35:35.625
[inaudible] fucking [inaudible].

35:35.625 --> 35:37.625
Just making sure no one
gets the jump on us.

35:45.542 --> 35:49.250
You see someone out there,
you're going to need that.

35:49.250 --> 35:52.000
Thanks but no thanks.

35:52.000 --> 35:55.833
Is there a problem?

35:55.833 --> 35:57.417
No.

35:57.417 --> 35:59.167
Just last time I
used one of these

35:59.167 --> 36:02.583
is the reason I
ended up in here.

36:02.583 --> 36:05.417
Well, now it's your ticket out.

36:08.917 --> 36:10.583
Yeah, fuck it.

36:10.583 --> 36:11.542
Kill this, man.

36:16.500 --> 36:18.750
So what are you going
to do with your split?

36:18.750 --> 36:22.167
Man, I'm gong to work
through with this.

36:22.167 --> 36:23.917
I don't know about
you, but I can sure

36:23.917 --> 36:26.292
go for some good floor steak.

36:26.292 --> 36:28.000
The hell's a floor steak?

36:28.000 --> 36:29.292
Come on, man.

36:29.292 --> 36:32.333
That good pussy, that
meat between the sheets.

36:32.333 --> 36:35.250
Ankles up, always ready.

36:46.625 --> 36:47.500
Motherfucker!

36:59.583 --> 37:04.125
Telling you, he's not
going to go for that.

37:04.125 --> 37:05.167
Yeah?

37:05.167 --> 37:06.292
When the last time someone did?

37:06.292 --> 37:07.292
If you can tell
me that, then I'll

37:07.292 --> 37:08.708
gladly go along with this shit.

37:08.708 --> 37:11.417
But until then, stop
pulling this shit on me, OK?

37:11.417 --> 37:12.958
I'm a 30-year man.

37:12.958 --> 37:26.667
I've been doing this shit before
you were watching Nick Jr.

37:26.667 --> 37:27.750
No luck?

37:27.750 --> 37:29.958
I don't think they
realize they're

37:29.958 --> 37:33.458
going to be responsible for
the deaths of an unknown number

37:33.458 --> 37:36.333
of civilians if they think
that playing by the book

37:36.333 --> 37:37.708
is the best option.

37:37.708 --> 37:40.792
Going by the book doesn't
defuse these situations.

37:40.792 --> 37:41.500
Gut instinct does.

37:41.500 --> 37:43.000
Only gut instinct does.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
Yeah, I hear that.

37:44.000 --> 37:44.625
Right.

37:49.125 --> 37:49.875
I need an update.

37:55.625 --> 37:57.292
Jenner, hey.

37:57.292 --> 37:58.833
Nothing yet.

37:58.833 --> 38:02.208
Nothing yet, but I need
a little bit more time.

38:02.208 --> 38:05.708
[gun shots]

38:07.042 --> 38:11.000
That's another hostage death
because of your negligence.

38:11.000 --> 38:15.042
I hope that helps you
take me more seriously.

38:15.042 --> 38:16.250
It certainly does.

38:16.250 --> 38:18.208
And my transportation?

38:18.208 --> 38:19.708
En route.

38:19.708 --> 38:22.333

38:22.333 --> 38:23.208

fucking going to the gym?

clear the hallways.

39:15.417 --> 39:16.833
I'll meet you on the West Wing.

40:01.083 --> 40:05.125
Get the fuck down the hallway.

40:05.125 --> 40:08.708
[machine gun fire]

40:11.500 --> 40:15.500
[action music]

40:15.500 --> 40:19.083
[knife unsheathes]

40:20.208 --> 40:33.083
The fuck is going
on, [? nuovo? ?]

40:33.083 --> 40:33.833
Oh!

40:33.833 --> 40:35.000
[slashing sound]

40:35.000 --> 40:36.333
[body thuds]

40:36.333 --> 40:39.542
[punches exchanging]

40:40.000 --> 40:42.333
[grunts]

40:42.333 --> 40:45.917
[stabbing sound]

40:47.958 --> 40:51.542
[eerie music]

40:54.917 --> 40:58.542
[tense music]

41:03.875 --> 41:04.583
New recruits?

41:10.125 --> 41:13.208
Where are the bodies?

41:13.208 --> 41:15.083
Bodies?

41:15.083 --> 41:16.500
The bodies.

41:16.500 --> 41:19.917
You told the negotiator
you're executing hostages.

41:19.917 --> 41:20.500
I did.

41:20.500 --> 41:22.042
You're right.

41:22.042 --> 41:25.042
But I guess you're not.

41:25.042 --> 41:30.208
Ruke, would you take the
men out and do the rounds?

41:30.208 --> 41:31.417
Copy that.

41:31.417 --> 41:32.167
[footsteps]

41:32.167 --> 41:32.750
Come on.

41:37.625 --> 41:38.583
Let me see.

41:43.833 --> 41:50.417
You see these people
are willfully ignorant.

41:50.417 --> 41:56.625
They don't understand how things
play out in the real world.

41:56.625 --> 41:57.250
What people?

41:59.750 --> 42:01.625
Those that are not enlightened.

42:04.083 --> 42:08.417
Did you know 90% of
humanity won't cry for help

42:08.417 --> 42:11.000
until the ship is sinking?

42:11.000 --> 42:14.000
They're like pigs
to the slaughter.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.792
As long as it means their
bubbles of self-delusion

42:16.792 --> 42:19.292
aren't [? popped ?] [? then ?]
they can die peacefully

42:19.292 --> 42:22.417
believing whatever bullshit
they spent their entire lives

42:22.417 --> 42:24.458
filling their heads with.

42:24.458 --> 42:26.875
So what's your point?

42:26.875 --> 42:28.333
Point?

42:28.333 --> 42:30.792
Yeah, is there a greater point?

42:30.792 --> 42:33.625
A method to your madness?

42:33.625 --> 42:37.458
You know, I used to
be a cop, bomb squad.

42:37.458 --> 42:38.792
No.

42:38.792 --> 42:41.708
You know, I'm in here
for blowing up churches

42:41.708 --> 42:42.792
and government buildings.

42:42.792 --> 42:45.417
Why would I do that?

42:45.417 --> 42:47.417
To make a statement?

42:47.417 --> 42:48.667
To make a statement.

42:48.667 --> 42:52.000
You are smarter than
I thought you were.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.750
I was tired of seeing
all the bullshit

42:53.750 --> 42:55.417
and I knew I had
to do something.

42:55.417 --> 42:56.875
Did you kill innocent people?

42:56.875 --> 43:01.333
Hmm, see, my
definition of innocence

43:01.333 --> 43:04.042
is different than others.

43:04.042 --> 43:07.000
And do you know why they can
only get me with four charges?

43:11.083 --> 43:12.167
You got me?

43:12.167 --> 43:15.458
Because I was told I
almost had a hung jury.

43:15.458 --> 43:18.500
You see, my lawyer had a way
of convincing the jurors to see

43:18.500 --> 43:21.833
my side of the argument.

43:21.833 --> 43:25.792
You see, people need to
get punished so I took away

43:25.792 --> 43:27.125
their meaning of life.

43:27.125 --> 43:29.750
Their churches, their
financial institutions,

43:29.750 --> 43:32.167
these things that they believe
give their life meaning.

43:35.208 --> 43:36.958
I hear you.

43:36.958 --> 43:39.208
Who are these people you
asked to be released?

43:39.208 --> 43:41.958
[chuckles] I don't know.

43:41.958 --> 43:46.542
Ruke gave me their names
based off their confessions.

43:46.542 --> 43:47.958
You see, if you
give law enforcement

43:47.958 --> 43:50.083
a large enough task,
they will bury themselves

43:50.083 --> 43:54.375
in it before they realize
they've been duped.

43:54.375 --> 43:56.958
Do you understand?

43:56.958 --> 43:57.833
Yes, I do.

44:00.583 --> 44:02.042
You're too smart to be in here.

44:07.375 --> 44:10.750
[panting]

44:10.750 --> 44:12.625
Somebody just killed two of us.

44:12.625 --> 44:13.917
Who?

44:13.917 --> 44:15.667
I didn't get a good
look at him, man.

44:15.667 --> 44:17.917
Fucking smoke grenade.

44:17.917 --> 44:20.250
He wasn't dressed like no cop.

44:20.250 --> 44:20.917
Bomber?

44:20.917 --> 44:23.292
[radio crackling] Cruz?

44:26.125 --> 44:26.917
We got a problem.

44:29.250 --> 44:32.333
Someone is clearly not
playing by the rules.

44:32.333 --> 44:35.208
[police siren]

44:35.208 --> 44:36.625
Chandler, hey.

44:36.625 --> 44:38.500
Hey, can you to fill me in?

44:38.500 --> 44:41.125
Someone is killing my men.

44:41.125 --> 44:43.167
I gave a warning in my
initial announcement.

44:43.167 --> 44:45.667
Nobody comes in, nobody
plays hero today.

44:45.667 --> 44:49.167
[gunshots]

44:51.333 --> 44:52.167
Shit.

44:52.167 --> 44:55.292
[tires screeching]

44:58.292 --> 45:01.875
[cellphone vibrates]

45:04.250 --> 45:06.500
[dialing]

45:06.500 --> 45:07.208
[phone ringing]

45:07.208 --> 45:08.625
Who is it?

45:08.625 --> 45:09.458
Alex?

45:09.458 --> 45:11.333
Alex?

45:11.333 --> 45:13.042
How'd you get the name?

45:13.042 --> 45:16.000
Ah, the same way I figured
out, you know, the janitor.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.833
Listen, I've already told
you guys I'm on your side.

45:18.833 --> 45:20.375
We know that.

45:20.375 --> 45:21.667
Look, we need you out.

45:21.667 --> 45:23.542
You've made your presence
known and Chandler

45:23.542 --> 45:24.875
has begun executing hostages.

45:24.875 --> 45:27.958
You know, I'm not
sure about that.

45:27.958 --> 45:29.167
Why?

45:29.167 --> 45:30.583
Well, I've seen more than
half of this damn place

45:30.583 --> 45:32.958
and I haven't seen
a single hostage.

45:32.958 --> 45:35.917
And I've got to tell you,
I've got a bad feeling.

45:35.917 --> 45:38.333
Well, let's hope
you're wrong, OK?

45:38.333 --> 45:42.500
Listen, you've got to
do me another favor.

45:42.500 --> 45:43.333
What's that?

45:43.333 --> 45:44.375
OK.

45:44.375 --> 45:45.833
The prison inmates
that were released,

45:45.833 --> 45:50.250
any go by the name
of Vincent Barros?

45:50.250 --> 45:52.542
Vincent Barros?

45:52.542 --> 45:53.167
No.

45:55.625 --> 45:56.917
OK.

45:56.917 --> 45:59.083
I'm assuming you already
know that's my son.

46:02.417 --> 46:03.958
That means he's still here.

46:03.958 --> 46:07.500
In all likelihood, yes.

46:07.500 --> 46:10.625
[cuts call]

46:10.625 --> 46:11.208
Vinny.

46:14.083 --> 46:15.458
I don't know what's going on.

46:20.292 --> 46:28.375
[breathing heavily] There
is a snake in the henhouse.

46:28.375 --> 46:33.542
There is someone in here
stealing your freedom.

46:33.542 --> 46:34.458
Killing your friends.

46:37.458 --> 46:38.375
It is not a cop.

46:40.875 --> 46:41.875
I know cops.

46:45.333 --> 46:48.833
Special forces, it's
the only kind of person

46:48.833 --> 46:52.875
to be able to stay
undetected this long.

46:52.875 --> 46:57.917
So what do we get
if we take him down?

46:57.917 --> 47:00.000
Oh, you want a reward?

47:00.000 --> 47:01.750
Someone's out there
taking us out.

47:01.750 --> 47:04.750
It's only right if
we get more money.

47:04.750 --> 47:07.583
OK, fine.

47:07.583 --> 47:11.667
$1 million to whoever
brings me that motherfucker.

47:11.667 --> 47:12.250
Dead.

47:15.500 --> 47:16.417
Let's go.

47:16.417 --> 47:17.167
[footsteps]

47:17.167 --> 47:17.833
Yes, sir.

47:21.958 --> 47:22.750
Bring him to me.

47:22.750 --> 47:25.750
[gun cocking]

47:25.750 --> 47:29.333
[tense music]

48:25.667 --> 48:29.292
[eerie music]

48:36.667 --> 48:38.333
[cellphone ringing]

48:38.333 --> 48:40.667
Oh.

48:40.667 --> 48:43.458
Hey.

48:43.458 --> 48:44.417
I found the hostages.

48:46.917 --> 48:47.958
I don't like that tone.

48:47.958 --> 48:51.125
I know that tone.

48:51.125 --> 48:54.458
They're all dead, right?

48:54.458 --> 48:57.125
Yeah, every one of them.

49:02.625 --> 49:04.917
Every single one of them.

49:04.917 --> 49:08.458
[sighs]

49:11.833 --> 49:12.917
Ah, shit.

49:15.542 --> 49:18.250
Hmm, that felt good.

49:18.250 --> 49:22.958
Might as well get in the may day

49:22.958 --> 49:26.458
[screams]

49:27.792 --> 49:31.708
[stabbing sounds]

49:31.708 --> 49:33.792
You let me go.

49:33.792 --> 49:35.292
You let me go.

49:35.292 --> 49:36.417
[chuckles]

49:36.417 --> 49:39.208
Let me go.

49:39.208 --> 49:40.542
You need to try harder.

49:46.625 --> 49:50.958
Let me show you what
a stabbing looks like.

49:50.958 --> 49:53.958
[gunshots]

49:53.958 --> 49:57.583
[grunts]

50:19.958 --> 50:23.542
[heavy breathing]

50:28.917 --> 50:32.500
[screams]

50:33.917 --> 50:37.375
[heavy breathing]

50:45.000 --> 50:46.833
OK.

50:46.833 --> 50:49.167
Come on.

50:49.167 --> 50:52.750
[tense music]

51:03.083 --> 51:05.625
[dial tone]

51:05.625 --> 51:09.208
[cellphone ringing]

51:09.625 --> 51:11.083
Alex?

51:11.083 --> 51:13.917
[chuckles]

51:13.917 --> 51:16.917
[chuckles] Chandler.

51:16.917 --> 51:17.542
That's right.

51:19.750 --> 51:22.375
I figured I'd keep this
one just between friends.

51:22.375 --> 51:25.500
Yeah, well, since we're friends,
I guess you should know.

51:25.500 --> 51:28.542
I-- I know your little secret.

51:28.542 --> 51:31.917
Oh, what's that?

51:31.917 --> 51:33.208
Oh, come on.

51:33.208 --> 51:35.708
The hostages,
they're already dead.

51:39.667 --> 51:41.958
Let me guess, your little
friend on the inside,

51:41.958 --> 51:43.917
what's his name, Alex?

51:43.917 --> 51:45.000
Did he tell you that?

51:45.000 --> 51:46.833
Is that right?

51:46.833 --> 51:49.167
That's right.

51:49.167 --> 51:51.500
And how do you know
it wasn't your friend?

51:51.500 --> 51:54.333
Because I know his type
and you should too.

51:54.333 --> 51:57.208
I mean, it used to
be a cop, right?

51:57.208 --> 52:01.208
I can't get anything
past you, John.

52:01.208 --> 52:03.208
So where does that leave us?

52:03.208 --> 52:04.792
Well, this gets
to the higher-ups

52:04.792 --> 52:07.833
and SWAT comes and then wipes
floor with your stupid ass.

52:07.833 --> 52:10.042
That's about it.

52:10.042 --> 52:11.583
Unless you didn't tell them.

52:15.375 --> 52:18.000
You didn't, did you?

52:18.000 --> 52:18.583
No.

52:23.500 --> 52:27.875
You really have a lot of faith
in your friend Alex, don't you?

52:27.875 --> 52:30.000
I do.

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
So where does this leave us now?

52:32.000 --> 52:33.625
You're still working
on your friends.

52:33.625 --> 52:35.042
Chopper's en route.

52:35.042 --> 52:37.542
I can't promise transportation
to anywhere other than Mexico.

52:37.542 --> 52:40.000
And once you make it
there, you're on your own.

52:40.000 --> 52:42.417
You won't be protected.

52:42.417 --> 52:43.833
Yeah.

52:43.833 --> 52:45.042
Win some, you lose some.

52:45.042 --> 52:48.583
[tense music]

52:52.583 --> 52:56.125
[deep breath]

53:05.250 --> 53:07.250
[door opens]

53:07.250 --> 53:08.833
[gunshots]

53:08.833 --> 53:12.208
[bullet ricochets]

53:12.208 --> 53:15.750
[gunshots]

53:26.125 --> 53:26.708
Vinny?

53:29.750 --> 53:31.625
Dad, what the fuck?

53:35.292 --> 53:37.750
I should have fucking
known it was you.

53:37.750 --> 53:39.125
What does that mean?

53:39.125 --> 53:40.375
You stayed behind.

53:40.375 --> 53:41.833
I wanted to stay behind.

53:41.833 --> 53:43.750
I was in the bathroom
when the bomb went off.

53:43.750 --> 53:45.500
Yeah, and then you
went into old ways,

53:45.500 --> 53:48.500
picking our guys off one by
one like it's a fucking wraith.

53:48.500 --> 53:50.542
I thought you only killed
people for a paycheck.

53:50.542 --> 53:51.875
Now's not the time for that.

53:51.875 --> 53:54.667
Now what did you say, our guys?

53:54.667 --> 53:57.083
Yeah, our guys.

53:57.083 --> 53:58.375
Oh, Vinny.

53:58.375 --> 53:59.667
Come on, man.

53:59.667 --> 54:00.500
What are you-- what
are you thinking?

54:00.500 --> 54:01.333
What are you doing?

54:01.333 --> 54:02.792
It's not the way.

54:02.792 --> 54:05.667
Max makes perfect sense.

54:05.667 --> 54:07.500
And he's one of the
few people I've ever

54:07.500 --> 54:11.333
met who knows how fucked
up the world really is.

54:11.333 --> 54:13.083
Trust me, Vinny,
there's a lot of people

54:13.083 --> 54:14.625
who feel the same way.

54:14.625 --> 54:20.125
Yeah, but they don't do a
damn thing about it, do they?

54:20.125 --> 54:21.083
Listen to your father.

54:21.083 --> 54:22.667
I've been there, OK?

54:22.667 --> 54:24.875
I've seen some horrible things.

54:24.875 --> 54:27.333
I've seen fucked up.

54:27.333 --> 54:29.500
And I've also seen things
worth fighting for.

54:29.500 --> 54:31.542
And I'm telling you,
this ain't one of them.

54:31.542 --> 54:33.667
You fight for a cause?

54:33.667 --> 54:37.458
Well, so do I. We're
more similar than I ever

54:37.458 --> 54:39.000
would have hoped.

54:39.000 --> 54:42.542
But what you did was legal.

54:42.542 --> 54:46.250
Vinny, this is real life
we're talking about.

54:46.250 --> 54:50.375
If you decide to leave here with
Max, you'll be shot on sight.

54:50.375 --> 54:51.333
Yeah, why's that?

54:51.333 --> 54:52.750
Why do you think?

54:52.750 --> 54:55.958
If only you knew
the fucking truth.

54:55.958 --> 54:58.958
You're the only one here
who's killing anybody.

54:58.958 --> 54:59.958
Oh, Jesus, Vinny.

54:59.958 --> 55:01.125
It's true.

55:01.125 --> 55:03.292
You're the only one
killing anybody.

55:03.292 --> 55:05.875
Max hasn't fucking
touched the hostages.

55:05.875 --> 55:07.208
That's not true, Vinny.

55:07.208 --> 55:08.250
Yes, it is.

55:08.250 --> 55:09.583
It's what he wants you to think.

55:09.583 --> 55:12.333
That whole PA, execution
shit, that's bullshit.

55:12.333 --> 55:15.208
You should know that.

55:15.208 --> 55:16.458
Shh.

55:16.458 --> 55:20.042
Vinny, the hostages are dead.

55:20.042 --> 55:21.208
Shut up.

55:21.208 --> 55:22.500
The hostages are dead.

55:22.500 --> 55:24.542
Don't try to fucking lie to me.

55:24.542 --> 55:25.708
I'm not lying to you.

55:25.708 --> 55:29.083
Stop being so fucking naive.

55:29.083 --> 55:30.875
Take a look at yourself.

55:30.875 --> 55:31.542
Don't you--

55:31.542 --> 55:33.417
Look where you are.

55:33.417 --> 55:35.292
Just stop being so
fucking naive, OK?

55:35.292 --> 55:37.083
That's what I used
to tell your mother.

55:37.083 --> 55:38.500
She used to listen everybody.

55:38.500 --> 55:39.583
Talking about my mother!

55:39.583 --> 55:40.792
Well, I'm trying
to tell you, you

55:40.792 --> 55:43.250
don't make the
same mistakes, OK?

55:43.250 --> 55:44.250
What are you--

55:44.250 --> 55:45.583
What kind of fucking mistakes?

55:45.583 --> 55:47.500
You're the only one
making a mistake here.

55:47.500 --> 55:49.708
Vinny, you're doing
the stupidest thing

55:49.708 --> 55:52.542
you could do, so
stop being naive

55:52.542 --> 55:54.375
and stop being like your mom.

55:54.375 --> 55:55.250
Like my mom?

55:55.250 --> 55:56.417
Listen to me.

55:56.417 --> 55:57.625
Tell me more about
my mom then, huh?

55:57.625 --> 56:00.625
As if you fucking
knew her like me.

56:00.625 --> 56:01.625
Vinny.

56:01.625 --> 56:03.708
You don't even know me.

56:03.708 --> 56:05.542
Stop it.

56:05.542 --> 56:07.750
You're being stupid, OK?

56:07.750 --> 56:09.833
I'm not going to tell you again.

56:09.833 --> 56:12.792
Your decision, what
are you going to do?

56:12.792 --> 56:15.125
Think about it.

56:15.125 --> 56:17.333
Come on, what are
you going to do?

56:17.333 --> 56:20.292
Fucking hate you, yo.

56:20.292 --> 56:22.375
But I'm not going to kill you.

56:22.375 --> 56:25.958
[gunshot]

56:29.292 --> 56:32.333
Get the fuck out of
here while you can.

56:32.333 --> 56:34.792
All right, dad?

56:34.792 --> 56:35.958
Oh, Jesus.

56:35.958 --> 56:37.708
Get the fuck out of here.

56:48.333 --> 56:49.875
[radio chatter]

56:49.875 --> 56:51.333
One for you.

56:51.333 --> 56:52.875
You wanna talk to it?

56:52.875 --> 56:53.458
Yeah.

56:53.458 --> 56:55.875
[radio chatter]

56:56.333 --> 56:57.208
What?

56:57.208 --> 56:57.833
[? sir, ?] I don't know.

56:57.833 --> 56:58.542
Nothing.

56:58.542 --> 56:59.250
Don't worry about it.

56:59.250 --> 57:00.083
[chuckles]

57:00.083 --> 57:01.542
[? gnp ?] on EMT.

57:01.542 --> 57:03.250
Don't worry about it.

57:03.250 --> 57:06.792
[eerie music]

57:23.667 --> 57:25.167
[? get me ?]
[? through to that ?]

57:25.167 --> 57:29.208
[? voice. ?] Come on.

57:29.208 --> 57:32.792
[grunts]

Oh.

58:35.583 --> 58:41.000
Rhino? Rhino?

58:41.000 --> 58:44.500
[radio static]

58:46.917 --> 58:47.625
Rhino, come in.

58:50.583 --> 58:53.167
Uh, Rhino, no,
he ain't come back.

58:55.792 --> 59:00.458
Alex, nice to meet you.

59:00.458 --> 59:03.583
Can't say I feel the same way.

59:03.583 --> 59:07.083
You've killed quite a
few of my men today.

59:07.083 --> 59:09.083
They had it coming.

59:09.083 --> 59:12.667
An unfortunate
side-effect of progress.

59:12.667 --> 59:14.292
You spend enough
time and a place

59:14.292 --> 59:17.375
like this you'd understand,
but you wouldn't get that,

59:17.375 --> 59:19.333
would you?

59:19.333 --> 59:21.583
Believe me, I would.

59:21.583 --> 59:23.917
[grunts]

59:23.917 --> 59:25.708
Where did you do your time?

59:30.250 --> 59:33.500
Marawi City, Philippines.

59:33.500 --> 59:36.667
We flew into expected
Congressman's plane went down

59:36.667 --> 59:41.167
and I lost my whole unit.

59:41.167 --> 59:44.667
Ended up in some POW camp.

59:44.667 --> 59:46.833
I had to fight my own way
out because the government

59:46.833 --> 59:48.167
wouldn't come to terms.

59:48.167 --> 59:54.333
And so good news is, got
an honorable discharge.

59:54.333 --> 59:58.417
But the pension pays about as
much as a fast food manager,

59:58.417 --> 01:00:00.417
so I'm fine.

01:00:00.417 --> 01:00:01.000
I'm good.

01:00:04.708 --> 01:00:07.875
I made a career in the LAPD.

01:00:07.875 --> 01:00:10.500
Had one bad session with
the staff psychiatrist

01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:14.667
and I got put on leave with a
severance where I couldn't even

01:00:14.667 --> 01:00:17.042
afford a studio in
South Central LA.

01:00:17.042 --> 01:00:19.958
But I found my higher calling.

01:00:22.792 --> 01:00:26.458
Yeah, I remember your name.

01:00:26.458 --> 01:00:28.042
Ex-hero cop who
turned Unabomber.

01:00:28.042 --> 01:00:29.833
But I got to tell
you something, Max.

01:00:29.833 --> 01:00:32.750
I'm not sure a bad psych
evaluation is worth

01:00:32.750 --> 01:00:36.000
killing all these innocent
people, you get me?

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.042
Oh, I only killed
people who were

01:00:38.042 --> 01:00:42.208
responsible for the social
and economic downfall

01:00:42.208 --> 01:00:44.542
of this nation.

01:00:44.542 --> 01:00:46.750
I sympathize with
you on that one, pal.

01:00:49.083 --> 01:00:54.583
You give your life to a cause
then they spit in your face.

01:00:54.583 --> 01:00:56.250
For no reason.

01:00:56.250 --> 01:01:02.083
Other than that, no use for
you in one way whatsoever.

01:01:02.083 --> 01:01:04.000
Your particular
case, Max, I think

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.083
it's time maybe you cash it in.

01:01:07.083 --> 01:01:09.875
Call it in or call
it a day, pal.

01:01:09.875 --> 01:01:13.000
Maybe they'll look after you.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.583
They only kept me
alive because I've

01:01:14.583 --> 01:01:18.583
been leaking Intel to the FBI.

01:01:18.583 --> 01:01:20.333
You know, after
today, I don't think

01:01:20.333 --> 01:01:23.667
they'll have any use for
me, kind of like the LAPD

01:01:23.667 --> 01:01:25.583
after I divulged my feelings.

01:01:25.583 --> 01:01:31.292
No, it's-- it's too
late for me, Alex.

01:01:31.292 --> 01:01:33.958
I hear you.

01:01:33.958 --> 01:01:36.917
Then let's make a deal.

01:01:36.917 --> 01:01:43.000
If it's a cop that's going
to take you out, go with me.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.750
I'll make sure it's me first.

01:01:48.875 --> 01:01:52.417
You know there's one thing
that we forgot to discuss.

01:01:52.417 --> 01:01:53.958
Yeah, what's that?

01:01:53.958 --> 01:01:55.750
Well, you're not a cop.

01:01:55.750 --> 01:01:58.500
You're not a
corrections officer.

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:01.667
So who are you?

01:02:05.583 --> 01:02:06.292
I'm the janitor.

01:02:08.750 --> 01:02:12.333
[chuckles] Bullshit.

01:02:12.333 --> 01:02:14.458
You wouldn't be here
right now unless you were

01:02:14.458 --> 01:02:16.417
trying to get somebody out.

01:02:16.417 --> 01:02:19.958
[tense music]

01:02:38.667 --> 01:02:42.292
[grunts]

01:02:43.667 --> 01:02:45.250
[breathing heavily]

01:02:45.250 --> 01:02:49.042
[numbers dialing]

01:02:49.042 --> 01:02:50.583
Which one is this, huh?

01:02:50.583 --> 01:02:51.792
This is me too, Alex.

01:02:51.792 --> 01:02:52.792
Hey, thank God for that.

01:02:52.792 --> 01:02:54.292
Alex, hey.

01:02:54.292 --> 01:02:56.333
They have my son.

01:02:56.333 --> 01:02:56.958
What?

01:02:56.958 --> 01:02:58.000
He was a hostage?

01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.333
No, no, no, he's not a hostage.

01:02:59.333 --> 01:03:01.750
Somehow Max convinced
him to join the team.

01:03:01.750 --> 01:03:03.250
OK, listen, man.

01:03:03.250 --> 01:03:05.208
There's a helicopter
coming right now

01:03:05.208 --> 01:03:07.875
and he thinks it's going
to take him to the border.

01:03:07.875 --> 01:03:10.917
The thing is, he doesn't
know that my superiors are

01:03:10.917 --> 01:03:14.000
aware he's executed
the hostages already.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.208
So once the helicopter
takes off, Chandler's dead.

01:03:17.208 --> 01:03:18.708
And then SWAT's
gonna go in there

01:03:18.708 --> 01:03:20.583
and take out the
rest of his team.

01:03:20.583 --> 01:03:23.542
And that's it.

01:03:23.542 --> 01:03:25.708
Did you hear me, Alex?

01:03:25.708 --> 01:03:29.417
No, wait, what-- wait, wait.

01:03:29.417 --> 01:03:31.458
Don't let them kill my son.

01:03:31.458 --> 01:03:34.042
Look, I'm afraid it's out
of my hands at this point.

01:03:34.042 --> 01:03:35.833
It's out of my
hands at this point.

01:03:38.292 --> 01:03:40.542
How long do I have?

01:03:40.542 --> 01:03:42.500
Not long.

01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:44.042
Minutes.

01:03:44.042 --> 01:03:45.417
That's all I need.

01:03:45.417 --> 01:03:49.042
[tense music]

01:04:00.333 --> 01:04:03.250
[side conversation]

01:04:04.250 --> 01:04:07.417
Stay frostie.
It's getting done.

01:04:07.417 --> 01:04:08.958
He's going to smile.

01:04:08.958 --> 01:04:10.125
All right, gentlemen?

01:04:10.125 --> 01:04:11.500
That's what I'm
here for now, buddy.

01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:12.583
You like the sound of that?

01:04:12.583 --> 01:04:15.125
[chuckles] A well-earned rest.

01:04:15.125 --> 01:04:17.417
Well, especially after our last.

01:04:17.417 --> 01:04:17.833
Oh.

01:04:17.833 --> 01:04:19.125
Right?

01:04:19.125 --> 01:04:21.167
Yeah, stuff is harder than that.

01:04:21.167 --> 01:04:22.750
That go his way?

01:04:22.750 --> 01:04:23.667

01:04:31.958 --> 01:04:34.250
...just that nice
long vacation.

01:04:34.250 --> 01:04:36.000
Aww, man.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.625
I got that new girl
I'm gonna take.

01:04:37.625 --> 01:04:39.125
There you go.

01:04:39.125 --> 01:04:40.625
Money well spent, I hope.

01:04:40.625 --> 01:04:41.625
Yeah.

01:04:41.625 --> 01:04:45.458
All it does is cost more.

01:04:45.458 --> 01:04:46.792
Spend wisely.

01:04:46.792 --> 01:04:49.542
[laughter]

01:04:49.542 --> 01:04:50.292
Not tonight.

01:04:50.292 --> 01:04:52.500
No exhume.

01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:53.667
Back to the job stuff.

01:04:53.667 --> 01:04:54.833
You're a smarter man than me.

01:04:54.833 --> 01:04:56.167
Nah.

01:04:56.167 --> 01:04:57.375
It's wise to
hold down, right?

01:04:57.375 --> 01:04:57.833
Let's do it.

01:04:57.833 --> 01:04:59.250
Yeah.

01:04:59.250 --> 01:05:01.625
Spend a nice long vacation.

01:05:01.625 --> 01:05:03.458
Aww, yeah.

01:05:03.458 --> 01:05:05.042
Get that girl in there.

01:05:05.042 --> 01:05:05.667
There you go.

01:05:05.667 --> 01:05:06.542
Hey.

01:08:07.583 --> 01:08:10.125

Delta at three...

[inaudible] Remember [inaudible]
shoot on [inaudible]..

01:08:21.332 --> 01:08:23.207
Wow.

01:08:23.207 --> 01:08:24.542
You're the snake.

01:08:27.792 --> 01:08:28.667
I hate snakes.

01:08:50.582 --> 01:08:55.542
[punching]

01:09:13.292 --> 01:09:15.082
It's all good.

01:09:15.082 --> 01:09:18.582
I can do this all day.

01:09:18.582 --> 01:09:19.457
Are you ready?

01:09:21.917 --> 01:09:22.750
Yeah.

01:09:22.750 --> 01:09:24.707
[laughs]

01:09:30.625 --> 01:09:37.582
[groaning]

01:09:40.957 --> 01:09:44.332
It's disappointing.

01:09:44.332 --> 01:09:48.417
I bet you were a bad
dude back in the day.

01:09:48.417 --> 01:09:50.582
And now, you're old.

01:09:50.582 --> 01:09:51.250
You're tired.

01:09:53.707 --> 01:09:57.208
What are you anyway, hm?

01:09:57.208 --> 01:09:58.583
Army?

01:09:58.583 --> 01:10:01.792
Special forces?

01:10:01.792 --> 01:10:04.958
Navy SEAL?

01:10:04.958 --> 01:10:07.125
No, no, no.

01:10:07.125 --> 01:10:08.833
I know what you are.

01:10:08.833 --> 01:10:11.375
The only way you could have
creeped around all day picking

01:10:11.375 --> 01:10:12.458
us off one by one.

01:10:12.458 --> 01:10:14.917
You're a rough fucking ninja.

01:10:14.917 --> 01:10:18.375
[laughter]

01:10:21.667 --> 01:10:24.167
Black Ops.

01:10:24.167 --> 01:10:25.917
I know the type.

01:10:25.917 --> 01:10:30.958
I think someone like you
will be used to the pain.

01:10:30.958 --> 01:10:35.292
I spent weeks in a Taliban
camp in Afghanistan

01:10:35.292 --> 01:10:36.833
being waterboarded.

01:10:36.833 --> 01:10:40.417
I thought for sure I
was dead at one point.

01:10:40.417 --> 01:10:45.792
Then, the goddamn American
army came in guns blazing.

01:10:45.792 --> 01:10:53.333
Turns out the British patrol
missed me by barely 50 feet.

01:10:53.333 --> 01:10:57.750
Those motherfuckers just
didn't look hard enough.

01:10:57.750 --> 01:11:02.333
That's when I knew guys
like Max had it right.

01:11:02.333 --> 01:11:06.167
We're all expendable
to those in charge.

01:11:06.167 --> 01:11:11.417
And the only way you get them
to listen is to light a fire

01:11:11.417 --> 01:11:12.833
and watch them run.

01:11:15.542 --> 01:11:17.875
[laughs]

01:11:19.125 --> 01:11:19.833
Yeah.

01:11:19.833 --> 01:11:22.667
[groaning]

01:11:25.042 --> 01:11:26.958
Hm.

01:11:26.958 --> 01:11:28.500
Fighting to the end, huh?

01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:30.000
It seems like
you've been around.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.042
[laughs]

01:11:31.042 --> 01:11:32.500
OK.

01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:33.792
Now, let me take you somewhere
that you haven't been.

01:11:33.792 --> 01:11:34.542
Let's do it.

01:11:34.542 --> 01:11:35.042
Yeah.

01:11:35.042 --> 01:11:35.958

01:12:25.250 --> 01:12:28.250
[phone beeps]

01:12:28.250 --> 01:12:29.583
Your ride's here.

01:12:29.583 --> 01:12:31.958
Be on the move in
five minutes, not six.

01:12:31.958 --> 01:12:32.958
Five.

01:12:32.958 --> 01:12:35.000
Good.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.917
Five minutes.

01:12:36.917 --> 01:12:37.750
What about the others?

01:12:37.750 --> 01:12:39.375
They're not going to make it.

01:12:39.375 --> 01:12:41.583
Let's go.

01:12:41.583 --> 01:12:43.542
What do you mean they're
not going to make it?

01:12:43.542 --> 01:12:44.500
I mean they're not
going to make it.

01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:45.542
Is there a problem?

01:12:51.958 --> 01:12:52.708
Are you coming?

01:12:54.542 --> 01:12:56.667
If you are, you probably
want to leave the gun here.

01:12:56.667 --> 01:12:59.167
They will shoot you on site.

01:12:59.167 --> 01:12:59.792
Problem?

01:13:02.958 --> 01:13:04.125
No.

01:13:04.125 --> 01:13:05.708
Good.

01:13:05.708 --> 01:13:06.333
Let's go.

01:13:09.875 --> 01:13:14.208

01:13:14.208 --> 01:13:20.708
[music playing]

01:13:23.083 --> 01:13:23.833
Ha!

01:13:23.833 --> 01:13:24.667
Right on time.

01:13:31.792 --> 01:13:36.208
Oh, I should learn to
trust my instincts.

01:13:36.208 --> 01:13:37.333
He's here for you, isn't he?

01:13:37.333 --> 01:13:39.333
[helicopter whirring]

01:13:39.333 --> 01:13:42.500
[sirens]

01:13:43.292 --> 01:13:44.000
Who is he?

01:13:46.917 --> 01:13:48.583
Huh?

01:13:48.583 --> 01:13:49.333
Your brother?

01:13:49.333 --> 01:13:50.042
Your uncle?

01:13:50.042 --> 01:13:50.750
Your cousin?

01:13:50.750 --> 01:13:50.875
Who is he?

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.042
He's my father.

01:14:00.042 --> 01:14:02.167
He's your father?

01:14:02.167 --> 01:14:04.833
[laughs] I should
have known that.

01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:08.667
I don't care about him.

01:14:08.667 --> 01:14:11.375
I don't even fucking like him.

01:14:11.375 --> 01:14:14.167
Let's test that theory.

01:14:14.167 --> 01:14:16.458
How about when he comes up
here, you take this gun,

01:14:16.458 --> 01:14:17.958
and you point it at him?

01:14:17.958 --> 01:14:21.000
You can put a
bullet in his head.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:24.125
How do you know I'm not
going to point it at you?

01:14:24.125 --> 01:14:26.708
Oh, I don't.

01:14:26.708 --> 01:14:27.917
Let's play a little game.

01:14:27.917 --> 01:14:28.625
Let's find out.

01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:35.958
You want it?

01:14:38.708 --> 01:14:40.167
Take it.

01:14:43.042 --> 01:14:44.208
Take it.

01:14:44.208 --> 01:14:45.125
[inaudible], kid.

01:14:45.125 --> 01:14:45.917
Take the gun.

01:14:45.917 --> 01:14:46.500
Fuck off.

01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:47.250
Take the gun.

01:14:47.250 --> 01:14:49.458
Point it at me.

01:14:49.458 --> 01:14:50.500
That's right.

01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:52.042
It feels good in your hand, huh?

01:14:52.042 --> 01:14:53.917
Now, all you've got to
do is point it at me

01:14:53.917 --> 01:14:56.083
and pull the fucking trigger.

01:14:56.083 --> 01:14:58.458
You're in control of
your own fucking destiny.

01:14:58.458 --> 01:14:59.500
Do you want to be with me?

01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:00.542
Do you want to be with your dad?

01:15:00.542 --> 01:15:01.375
Do you want to be with yourself?

01:15:01.375 --> 01:15:03.667
What do you want?

01:15:03.667 --> 01:15:06.542
Point it at me.

01:15:06.542 --> 01:15:12.375
[police sirens]

01:15:12.375 --> 01:15:14.917
That's it.

01:15:14.917 --> 01:15:16.667
Higher.

01:15:16.667 --> 01:15:18.125
Point the gun at my face.

01:15:18.125 --> 01:15:19.250
Pull the trigger.

01:15:19.250 --> 01:15:21.542
That's right.

01:15:21.542 --> 01:15:22.708
You can do it.

01:15:28.083 --> 01:15:29.500
That's right.

01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:31.083
That's right.

01:15:31.083 --> 01:15:33.083
[helicopter whirring]

01:15:33.083 --> 01:15:35.875
It's hard to hold it still
with a helicopter up above you,

01:15:35.875 --> 01:15:36.917
isn't it?

01:15:36.917 --> 01:15:39.917
See, now that is control.

01:15:39.917 --> 01:15:41.083
Do it.

01:15:41.083 --> 01:15:41.833
Pull the trigger.

01:15:41.833 --> 01:15:42.250
Shut up!

01:15:46.208 --> 01:15:48.208
[screaming]

01:15:54.542 --> 01:15:57.625
You have an amazing
new life ahead of you.

01:15:57.625 --> 01:15:59.083
I'm proud of you.

01:16:01.958 --> 01:16:02.583
Let's go.

01:16:05.667 --> 01:16:06.750
Alex!

01:16:06.750 --> 01:16:07.667
Dad.

01:16:08.167 --> 01:16:10.583
You come to see us off?

01:16:10.583 --> 01:16:12.083
Nope.

01:16:12.083 --> 01:16:14.083
Vincent, are you OK?

01:16:14.083 --> 01:16:16.208
Good.

01:16:16.208 --> 01:16:17.125
You?

01:16:17.125 --> 01:16:17.667
Yeah, I'm good.

01:16:17.667 --> 01:16:18.333
Come here, son.

01:16:18.333 --> 01:16:19.583
Come.

Dad!

01:16:24.167 --> 01:16:25.125
No, no, no, no, no.

01:16:25.125 --> 01:16:25.500
Dad.

01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:26.417
Dad.

01:16:26.417 --> 01:16:27.250
Dad, where are you hit?

01:16:27.250 --> 01:16:28.000
Where are you hit?

I got you.

01:16:29.625 --> 01:16:31.375
I got you.

01:16:31.375 --> 01:16:32.583
I'm good, Vinny.

01:16:32.583 --> 01:16:34.417
Took my right arm.
Lift the gun.

01:16:34.417 --> 01:16:35.458
Lift the gun.

01:16:35.458 --> 01:16:36.208
OK.

01:16:36.208 --> 01:16:36.833
Lift the gun.

Oh, my son.

01:17:53.917 --> 01:17:57.458
You know, you have grown
big like your grandfather.

01:17:57.458 --> 01:17:59.542
He was a big man.

01:17:59.542 --> 01:18:01.292
I'm sorry for shooting you.

01:18:01.292 --> 01:18:02.292
That's OK, son.

01:18:02.292 --> 01:18:04.208
I think I deserved that one.

Let's go.

01:18:31.208 --> 01:18:32.458
I got one problem.

01:18:32.458 --> 01:18:36.208
You've been looking at
me, and I don't like that.

01:18:36.208 --> 01:18:38.208

to a hospital, kid.
