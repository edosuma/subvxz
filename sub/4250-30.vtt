OH, SHE'S KNOWN AS
THE EATER OF HEARTS.

SHE WOULD DEVOUR THE HEART
OF A PERSON DEEMED IMPURE.

THEIR SOUL WOULD WANDER RESTLESS
FOREVER,

15:40.773 --> 15:45.194
- MORE LIKE AN EXECUTIONER.

15:45.277 --> 15:48.697
HOWEVER, AMMIT BECAME ANGRY

15:48.781 --> 15:51.075
AND GREW FRUSTRATED
WITH THE GOD ANUBIS.

15:51.158 --> 15:53.786
SHE CONSIDERED HERSELF
ANUBIS'S EQUAL

15:53.869 --> 15:57.665
AND WANTED MORE THAN JUST
THE IMPURE HEARTS OF THE DEAD.

15:57.748 --> 15:59.458
- GOT TOO BIG FOR HER BOOTS.

15:59.541 --> 16:01.210

16:05.506 --> 16:07.549
- OH, SHE'S BACK IN THE HOME.

16:07.633 --> 16:10.052
- YOU NEVER MENTIONED
YOU HAD A SISTER.

16:10.135 --> 16:11.720
- DIDN'T I?

16:11.804 --> 16:13.722
WELL, I DON'T LIKE
TO BRING UP THE SUBJECT.

16:13.806 --> 16:14.515

IT MAKES PEOPLE UNCOMFORTABLE.

16:14.598 --> 16:16.684
- OH, NOT ME.

I FOUND HER VERY...
SWEET.

16:19.687 --> 16:20.688
[laughs]

16:25.567 --> 16:30.239
- AMMIT'S DARK AMBITION WAS
TO CROSS INTO THE HUMAN REALM

16:30.322 --> 16:32.908
AND CLAIM THE HEARTS
OF THE LIVING.

16:32.991 --> 16:34.618

16:34.702 --> 16:36.537
- REALLY DON'T LIKE
WHERE THIS IS GOING.

16:40.499 --> 16:44.670

WERE TO EVER SUCCEED,

16:44.753 --> 16:46.797
HER STRENGTH
AND POWER WOULD GROW

16:46.880 --> 16:51.427
TO MAKE HER EQUAL
TO THAT OSIRIS,

16:51.510 --> 16:54.012

OR SOMETHING?

16:56.849 --> 16:58.100
MAYBE THERE'S A HAPPY ENDING.

16:58.183 --> 16:59.893
- YEAH, ARE THERE ANY
NICE PICTURES IN THERE?

17:05.148 --> 17:06.108
THAT'S NICER, RIGHT?

17:06.191 --> 17:07.483
THAT'S NOT SCARY.

17:07.568 --> 17:09.611

"TO CROSS OVER,
