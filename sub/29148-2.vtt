-I so needed this.
-[chuckles]

10:51.609 --> 10:53.527
You do seem tense, girl.

10:54.070 --> 10:55.905
What’s up? Boyfriend trouble?

10:57.281 --> 10:59.742
-Basically.
-Always is.

11:00.993 --> 11:02.411
I know I’m good in bed.

11:03.037 --> 11:05.623
You know, never had a complaint before.

11:05.790 --> 11:10.086
But he’s, like, uptight or something,
and it’s pissing me off.

11:10.169 --> 11:13.923
I dated this guy who washed his hands
the second we finished fucking.

11:14.423 --> 11:16.801
I was like, "Hello. I'm still here.

11:16.884 --> 11:19.595
[chuckles] And I don’t think your hands
are what need cleaning right now."

11:19.679 --> 11:20.763
[chuckles]

11:20.930 --> 11:22.515
Oh, men are dipshits, right?

11:22.598 --> 11:24.934
-[sighs] They are, they are.
-[Arthie] Excuse me.

11:25.017 --> 11:26.727
A wash and a blow-dry, please?

11:27.103 --> 11:28.813
Oh, hey, have a seat.

11:29.021 --> 11:30.606
I’ll try to fit you in.

11:35.361 --> 11:36.696
What are you guys talking about?

11:38.030 --> 11:39.115
Guy trouble.

11:39.573 --> 11:40.408
You know?

11:42.118 --> 11:43.202
I do...

11:43.744 --> 11:44.745
know.

11:45.121 --> 11:47.123
[Yolanda takes a deep breath]

11:48.833 --> 11:50.126
It’s funny ‘cause my...

11:51.127 --> 11:54.505
boyfriend is... being weird.

11:55.464 --> 11:57.925
It’s like he doesn’t wanna spend
the day together,

11:58.008 --> 12:01.512
even though we’ve been waiting
for weeks to have some free time.

12:01.595 --> 12:04.140
Maybe he wants some time for himself.

12:05.766 --> 12:09.353
Maybe he could actually communicate that
to me

12:09.437 --> 12:10.563
instead of running off

12:10.646 --> 12:12.648
-like some middle-school boy.
-[laughs]

12:12.857 --> 12:14.984
It’s funny you say that,
‘cause my boyfriend,

12:15.067 --> 12:19.405
he’s also like a middle-school boy, but...
more in the experience department.

12:19.864 --> 12:21.907
And yet,
he’s pretty good at making you come.

12:24.076 --> 12:25.619
-So I've heard.
-[sighs]

12:25.828 --> 12:27.830
-Through the grapevine.
-You know what?

12:28.205 --> 12:30.791
Fuck it. I don’t need a haircut.

12:31.751 --> 12:34.879
-I don’t need a boyfriend, either.
-[hairdresser] Good for you, honey.

12:36.547 --> 12:37.840
You wanna take her appointment?

12:40.509 --> 12:43.512
We were supposed to go to the Hoover Dam,
but then that got canceled,

12:43.596 --> 12:46.348
and now Rhonda’s sick to her stomach
because she's got these migraines,

12:46.432 --> 12:48.392
which, by the way,
isn’t just bad headaches,

12:48.476 --> 12:51.854
it’s an actual medical condition. And...
you know, I don’t know what to do.

12:51.937 --> 12:53.147
I mean, you know my family.

12:53.230 --> 12:55.941
Birdie didn’t give out hugs,
let alone take care of me.

12:56.233 --> 12:57.151
Bring me soup.

12:57.359 --> 13:01.989
-[sighs] Right, so this is about Rhonda?
-Yeah, what else would this be about?

13:02.072 --> 13:04.533
I thought maybe you wanted to hang out,
catch up.

13:05.868 --> 13:06.702
Yeah.

13:07.536 --> 13:09.121
Yeah, that-- that too.

13:11.123 --> 13:13.125
You wanna... You wanna watch something?

13:14.668 --> 13:15.961
Or, uh...

13:17.755 --> 13:19.924
-Could you please go help her?
-Me?

13:20.424 --> 13:23.302
-You're her husband.
-Yeah, and-- and you're her roommate.

13:23.385 --> 13:24.553
Former roommate.

13:25.012 --> 13:28.974
Tell you what, I can even stay down here,
and you can go stay in the penthouse, huh?

13:29.308 --> 13:33.270
So, what, you can be married to Rhonda
in the ring and at parties,

13:33.354 --> 13:35.272
but when she's sick,
it's not your problem?

13:35.356 --> 13:36.732
Carmen! Are you listening to me?

13:36.816 --> 13:39.902
I'm-- I'm bad at this, all right?
I-- I don’t handle illness well.

13:39.985 --> 13:42.571
-So, you know, help me out here.
-[Carmen] You know,

13:42.655 --> 13:45.741
I think this is the first time
you’ve even been to my room

13:45.825 --> 13:47.076
since we've been here.

13:47.368 --> 13:50.746
-I’m surprised you even knew where it was.
-[sighs] I know where it is.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.289
I-- I-- I just...

13:52.957 --> 13:55.334
I'm busy, you know? You-- You--
We're all busy.

13:55.501 --> 13:57.670
-[stammers] What is this? What's going on?
-[Carmen] I'm tired

13:57.753 --> 13:59.421
because I went out last night
and had fun,

13:59.505 --> 14:02.591
which is something I have not done
in a long time,

14:02.675 --> 14:04.885
because both
of my best friends abandoned me,

14:04.969 --> 14:07.972
and I live by myself
in this weird, big hotel room.

14:09.807 --> 14:11.100
So, if you don't mind,

14:11.642 --> 14:13.435
I'd love to go back to sleep,

14:13.519 --> 14:16.689
so I can wake up in five hours
and do it all over again tonight.

14:27.700 --> 14:31.036
-[door opens and closes]
-[sighs]

14:31.120 --> 14:33.122
[indistinct chatter]

14:35.457 --> 14:38.043
-I'm putting it all in.
-No, no, no, no, no.<i> </i>You're way up.

14:38.127 --> 14:40.337
-You gotta leave a winner.
-But we just got here.

14:40.421 --> 14:42.464
What, are you kidding?
We've been here two hours, Ruth.

14:42.548 --> 14:44.466
-Ah, we... No way.
-[Sam] Yes.

14:44.842 --> 14:46.176
That... Let me...

14:46.969 --> 14:48.470
-Holy shit.
-Yeah.

14:48.637 --> 14:50.639
That’s why they don't have clocks
at casinos.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.558
Now, tip Stevie and let’s cash it out.

14:53.350 --> 14:55.519
Uh, that’s not my money,
that’s your money.

14:55.603 --> 14:58.981
Twenty’s mine. Twenty to him.
The rest is yours.

15:02.067 --> 15:03.777
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

15:04.153 --> 15:05.446
[chuckles]

15:05.613 --> 15:07.865
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

15:07.948 --> 15:12.244
-[laughs] I'm starving. Are you starving?
-Hey, if you're buying, I'm eating.

15:12.328 --> 15:14.830
[Sam and Ruth chatting indistinctly]

15:17.499 --> 15:18.500
[Ruth] Mmm!

15:19.501 --> 15:20.419
There we go.

15:21.128 --> 15:23.005
-All right.
-Oh!

15:23.672 --> 15:25.132
You know, I wanted the filet.

15:25.215 --> 15:27.134
There's no fat, so there's no flavor.

15:27.635 --> 15:31.388
-I'm from Omaha. We take steak seriously.
-All right, I get it. Steak bully.

15:31.639 --> 15:32.890
[chuckles]

15:34.058 --> 15:34.975
Mmm.

15:35.726 --> 15:37.645
Oh, I'm sorry. Is it hot in here?

15:39.563 --> 15:41.231
No, not really.

15:41.690 --> 15:44.485
-I really feel like I could use some air.
-[Sam laughs] Come on!

15:44.568 --> 15:48.364
-Jesus. Quit flaunting your money.
-Why? No one's here.

15:48.447 --> 15:49.531
Except for those guys.

15:52.076 --> 15:53.118
Mm.

15:54.703 --> 15:55.663
Do you know them?

15:55.996 --> 16:01.085
-[quietly] No. It's a sign of respect.
-I thought the mob left Vegas.

16:01.502 --> 16:03.629
Could you change the subject
before you get us killed?

16:06.966 --> 16:08.801
To me being wrong about gambling.

16:09.176 --> 16:12.888
And to me being wrong
about you hating Vegas.

16:16.892 --> 16:18.227
I mean, I hate it a little.

16:18.727 --> 16:21.897
But I love living at the hotel.
Oh, have you been to the library?

16:22.314 --> 16:24.400
What? There's a library at the hotel?

16:24.483 --> 16:25.484
-[laughs]
-[Sam] Come on.

16:25.567 --> 16:27.987
No.<i> </i>At UNLV.

16:28.070 --> 16:30.447
It's great.
I forced them to give me a temporary card.

16:30.531 --> 16:33.117
Oh, my God.
This is like a nerd's-eye view of Vegas.

16:33.200 --> 16:34.535
-Hey!
-[Sam] What?

16:35.160 --> 16:37.621
I've never been so well-behaved here
in my life.

16:37.705 --> 16:38.914
-Oh, really?
-Oh, yeah.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.708
-This is you well-behaved?
-Absolutely.

16:40.791 --> 16:42.626
Usually, it's hookers, and blackjack,

16:42.710 --> 16:43.961
-and cocaine, and--
-Oh my!

16:44.169 --> 16:46.463
Uh-huh. [chuckles] Yeah.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.257
But, you know, it's been...

16:49.383 --> 16:50.467
it's been nice.

16:51.510 --> 16:52.678
You know? I mean...

16:53.262 --> 16:55.264
I'm getting paid to do very little work.

16:55.472 --> 16:58.934
I'm-- I'm writing something new
for the first time in a long time.

16:59.184 --> 17:00.811
Staying away from the tables.

17:01.103 --> 17:02.771
Not sick of the buffet yet.

17:03.564 --> 17:05.691
I'm even hitting the hot tub every night.

17:05.899 --> 17:09.069
I mean, this isn't like any Vegas
I've ever been to.

17:09.153 --> 17:11.363
I mean, it's something, but...

17:13.115 --> 17:14.992
Yeah. It's nice.

17:16.869 --> 17:18.370
This has been the best day.

17:19.121 --> 17:19.955
Yeah.

17:20.664 --> 17:21.540
[chuckles]

17:27.546 --> 17:28.797
Guess what time it is.

17:30.090 --> 17:32.760
Oh, uh... 4:45.

17:32.843 --> 17:34.178
I say 2:30.

17:34.678 --> 17:35.554
[Sam] Okay.

17:36.513 --> 17:38.307
Oh! You win.

17:38.390 --> 17:40.309
-[Sam] Oh, right on the money!
-Wow!

17:40.392 --> 17:43.353
-[chuckles]
-I told you this place was a time vortex.

17:44.021 --> 17:46.273
Well, I need to buy a watch.

17:47.107 --> 17:47.941
You know what?

17:49.818 --> 17:51.320
-Here you go.
-I can't.

17:51.403 --> 17:54.573
-That's your weird watch.
-[Sam] No, take it. Fuck it.

17:54.656 --> 17:57.785
It's a loan, all right?
We'll hit a pawn shop this week,

17:57.868 --> 17:59.828
we'll get you
your own dainty little timepiece

17:59.912 --> 18:03.332
that was previously owned
by some deranged heiress or something.

18:05.459 --> 18:06.668
[Ruth chuckles softly]

18:10.297 --> 18:11.381
[sighs]

18:20.682 --> 18:22.226
[Yolanda] You did not.

18:24.103 --> 18:25.145
I didn't what?

18:25.354 --> 18:26.271
[chuckles]

18:26.980 --> 18:28.690
I-- I was just gonna get a trim,

18:28.774 --> 18:31.860
not some major hair change
without asking your opinion.

18:32.277 --> 18:33.529
Why do you even care?

18:33.821 --> 18:35.239
I thought you broke up with me.

18:36.240 --> 18:37.658
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

18:37.741 --> 18:38.951
No, no.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.869
That was just a fight.

18:41.286 --> 18:43.413
Where people say mean things
they don't mean.

18:43.497 --> 18:46.542
-Haven't you ever been in a fight?
-I haven't been in anything.

18:46.917 --> 18:49.837
Hey, well,
I don't want to break up with you.

18:51.046 --> 18:53.048
I just want you to let me touch you.

18:54.007 --> 18:55.384
You touch me all the time.

18:56.176 --> 18:57.052
In the ring.

18:57.469 --> 18:59.263
But in bed, you get all weird about it.

18:59.680 --> 19:01.765
I learned exactly what you like
and how to do it.

19:01.849 --> 19:04.351
Then you see how satisfying that is
for you?

19:05.018 --> 19:06.478
To make me feel that good?

19:07.354 --> 19:09.064
I want to feel that way too.

19:09.439 --> 19:11.692
But every time I try to go down on you,

19:11.775 --> 19:13.569
you make me feel like shit.

19:14.820 --> 19:16.613
Do you actually even want me?

19:16.738 --> 19:18.073
Because you don't have to.

19:20.200 --> 19:21.243
I do.

19:22.911 --> 19:23.954
I just...

19:26.582 --> 19:28.542
I'm not sexy like you.

19:29.751 --> 19:33.672
I'm not comfortable
all splayed out like that, and I don't...

19:33.755 --> 19:34.882
[inhales deeply]

19:34.965 --> 19:37.092
I just get in my head, and then I can't--

19:37.342 --> 19:40.179
Oh, my God, you are crazy.

19:42.472 --> 19:44.224
You're so sexy.

19:44.641 --> 19:46.059
And beautiful.

19:47.144 --> 19:48.020
Shit.

19:48.896 --> 19:51.106
When I'm in the same room as you,
I just want to...

19:51.190 --> 19:53.066
grab you and pin you to the bed.

19:53.317 --> 19:54.193
[chuckles]

19:54.318 --> 19:56.320
[inhales deeply]

19:58.030 --> 19:58.906
Okay.

20:00.157 --> 20:01.366
So, pin me.

20:04.077 --> 20:05.579
Do it before I start overthinking.

20:06.705 --> 20:09.958
[electronic music playing]

20:13.003 --> 20:14.296
[chuckles softly]

20:17.299 --> 20:18.508
[Arthie] Mmm...

20:21.386 --> 20:23.430
Ooh! [laughs]

20:29.144 --> 20:30.604
-[chuckles]
-[both panting]

20:42.115 --> 20:43.325
[laughs nervously]

20:46.745 --> 20:49.539
-Does this mean we're back together?
-Shut the fuck up.

20:49.623 --> 20:50.791
[both chuckling]

20:59.800 --> 21:01.051
[sighs happily]

21:03.887 --> 21:05.180
[exhales]

21:09.059 --> 21:10.894
-[sighs]
-[footsteps approaching]

21:10.978 --> 21:12.104
[knocking at door]

21:14.189 --> 21:15.148
[whispers] Hi.

21:17.442 --> 21:20.988
-[Rhonda] Where did you go?
-I-- I thought you wanted to be alone.

21:21.446 --> 21:23.573
I wanted to be alone with you.

21:24.491 --> 21:25.784
Oh, sorry. I...

21:26.451 --> 21:29.871
In my family, whenever anyone got sick,
they were quarantined.

21:30.872 --> 21:32.624
Migraines aren't contagious.

21:33.834 --> 21:35.335
Emotionally quarantined.

21:35.419 --> 21:38.630
You were sent away to suffer in private.

21:39.840 --> 21:42.592
Well, in my family,
we comforted each other.

21:43.010 --> 21:46.305
'Cause that's how you show
that you care about someone.

21:50.017 --> 21:50.851
Um...

21:54.980 --> 21:57.774
[clears throat] Okay.

21:57.858 --> 22:00.444
-[gentle acoustic guitar music playing]
-[sighs]

22:00.610 --> 22:02.237
[exhales]

22:03.405 --> 22:06.158
-Here?
-Good. Don't move. That's perfect.

22:06.241 --> 22:08.160
-Okay.
-Just push harder.

22:08.327 --> 22:09.161
Okay.

22:09.953 --> 22:10.787
[exhales]

22:10.871 --> 22:12.664
Hey, listen, I-- I...

22:12.914 --> 22:15.959
I know it's a lot of change
with living together and being married,

22:16.043 --> 22:19.296
but if any of this is coming from a place
of-- of stress or anxiety

22:19.379 --> 22:20.714
about me not being a good partner,

22:20.797 --> 22:22.966
-then I want you to tell me.
-I'm... It's-- It's not.

22:23.258 --> 22:24.509
[sighs with relief] Okay, phew!

22:24.593 --> 22:26.261
'Cause I know
we don't really know each other,

22:26.345 --> 22:28.847
but I thought maybe we could,
you know, share our family history.

22:28.930 --> 22:32.434
I-- I could tell you about my Uncle Fred,
the caviar king of California,

22:32.517 --> 22:34.603
-or about my sister--
-Bash.

22:34.686 --> 22:36.355
-[Bash] Yeah?
-You're talking.

22:36.438 --> 22:38.690
[whispering]
Oh, right, right, right. Quiet.

22:39.066 --> 22:40.942
Ixnay on the alkingtay.

22:41.568 --> 22:44.863
I'm just gonna...
keep my finger in this exact spot,

22:45.822 --> 22:48.075
and I'm gonna be very, very quiet.

22:49.117 --> 22:51.411
-You won't even know I'm here.
-[sighs]

22:51.787 --> 22:54.748
That's how quiet I'm gonna be.
But I-- But I will be here.

22:55.749 --> 22:56.875
Now and...

22:57.167 --> 22:59.044
-[exhales]
-Now and in the future.

23:00.462 --> 23:04.257
And, uh... Okay, I'll stop.
I'm-- I'm done talking. So...

23:13.809 --> 23:17.187
[pilot over PA] <i>Forty-nine degrees</i>
<i>in Las Vegas. Should be a smooth ride.</i>

23:24.569 --> 23:26.530
-Oh, you're back.
-Hi. I know.

23:26.613 --> 23:28.365
The turnaround is brutal.

23:29.074 --> 23:32.786
Thank God for this shuttle
and for cocktails in business class.

23:33.036 --> 23:35.247
Well, that was a quick trip home.

23:35.789 --> 23:39.793
Yeah, 'cause I-- I work in Vegas
and live in LA.

23:39.876 --> 23:41.711
So, you only get to see your kid
one day a week.

23:43.171 --> 23:44.923
Not... Uh, two.

23:45.173 --> 23:50.011
And my job isn't the easiest
to schedule around... Brenda.

23:57.811 --> 23:59.062
Traveling for business?

24:00.230 --> 24:01.064
I am.

24:01.148 --> 24:02.023
Yeah.

24:04.234 --> 24:05.360
Can I ask you something?

24:05.444 --> 24:08.405
Has anyone ever asked you
how long you've been away from your kids?

24:08.488 --> 24:10.824
-Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. Uh...
-[chuckles]

24:12.868 --> 24:15.787
-Do you have kids?
-I have three boys.

24:16.538 --> 24:19.666
-No one asks me anything.
-Oh, God, that sounds amazing.

24:20.292 --> 24:21.918
I'm not much of a talker.

24:22.752 --> 24:23.837
[chuckles softly]

24:27.382 --> 24:28.884
[Debbie] Hi. Yeah, um,

24:28.967 --> 24:31.344
I know you're, God, an incredible mom,

24:31.428 --> 24:34.514
but my kid is still a baby,
and this is just... It's dangerous,

24:34.598 --> 24:37.392
so you can just keep your fucking wings.

24:43.398 --> 24:45.901
-I think Brenda jumped out the airplane.
-[laughs]

24:46.067 --> 24:47.611
[inhales deeply]

24:47.694 --> 24:49.112
I hope so.

24:49.196 --> 24:51.323
[phone ringing]

24:54.993 --> 24:56.953
-Hello?
<i>-</i>[Mark] <i>How was your flight?</i>

24:57.621 --> 24:59.414
What's going on?
Why-- Why are you calling me?

24:59.789 --> 25:02.792
Okay, something great happened,
but it will keep happening.

25:03.126 --> 25:06.004
<i>-Okay, so I don't want you to feel bad.</i>
<i>-</i>About what?

25:07.005 --> 25:08.507
He walked.

25:08.590 --> 25:10.217
[laughs] <i>I mean, it was, like,</i>

25:10.300 --> 25:11.676
<i>-two steps, but--</i>
-Wait...

25:11.801 --> 25:13.303
[stammers] He walked?

25:13.637 --> 25:15.597
Yeah. Walked. I mean, ish.

25:16.848 --> 25:17.891
When?

25:18.308 --> 25:21.061
[chuckles] <i>You gave him a bath,</i>
<i>and then you left,</i>

25:21.144 --> 25:23.146
<i>and then I brought him downstairs</i>
<i>to make his bottle,</i>

25:23.230 --> 25:26.358
<i>and I set him down,</i>
<i>and then I looked over, and...</i>

25:26.983 --> 25:28.318
He waited till I left?

25:29.277 --> 25:32.155
Debbie, he's a baby, not Michigan J. Frog.

25:34.574 --> 25:36.576
Oh, my God, I missed it.

25:36.868 --> 25:38.411
<i>Hey, I almost missed it too.</i>

25:38.578 --> 25:40.789
<i>I mean, I was there,</i>
<i>but my back was turned.</i>

25:45.001 --> 25:47.712
Yeah, but you turned around.
Oh, God, I hate you.

25:47.796 --> 25:50.006
[sighs] <i>I know. I wish you'd been here.</i>

25:50.757 --> 25:52.384
But the look on his face,

25:52.467 --> 25:55.554
it was like he couldn't believe
he was walking, either. [chuckles]

25:56.930 --> 25:58.431
Did Susan see?

26:01.518 --> 26:02.602
Oh, no.

26:08.066 --> 26:10.193
Um... [crying softly]

26:10.277 --> 26:14.781
Well, Mark, can you do me a favor
and buy a fucking camcorder...

26:15.323 --> 26:16.700
tomorrow?

26:18.410 --> 26:22.622
I will. I mean, you sold our last one,
but I will buy another one.

26:23.331 --> 26:24.332
S...

26:27.711 --> 26:28.795
[quietly] Shoot.

26:30.380 --> 26:32.382
[hot tub jets bubbling]

26:37.220 --> 26:38.388
[Ruth chuckles]

26:46.646 --> 26:47.731
[exhales]

26:52.235 --> 26:55.447
Ooh! [chuckles]

26:56.156 --> 26:57.365
Ooh...

26:59.200 --> 27:00.243
What are you doing?

27:01.244 --> 27:04.247
Ever since you said it at dinner,
it sounded like a good idea.

27:04.331 --> 27:05.373
What did?

27:06.541 --> 27:07.626
The hot tub.

27:08.835 --> 27:10.420
-What?
-[sighs]

27:15.091 --> 27:16.426
You bought me a steak.

27:18.303 --> 27:20.180
You bought yourself a steak.

27:24.851 --> 27:25.977
I am...

27:26.436 --> 27:27.854
trying my best

27:28.813 --> 27:29.856
to...

27:30.482 --> 27:31.733
keep it all...

27:32.525 --> 27:33.735
right on the line.

27:34.694 --> 27:37.614
Or... or right near the line.

27:40.867 --> 27:42.619
But you're making it impossible.

27:46.081 --> 27:46.956
I mean,

27:47.040 --> 27:47.916
[sighs]

27:47.999 --> 27:50.210
you have to know I'm in love with you.

27:52.671 --> 27:54.673
[stammers] And whatever, you know.
I mean...

27:55.590 --> 27:57.384
I can feel that, I can say that,

27:57.467 --> 28:00.303
but I can still be a fucking grown-up
about it, okay? But...

28:00.845 --> 28:02.764
it's just a little harder, you know,

28:02.847 --> 28:04.933
when you tell me
that this is the best day,

28:05.183 --> 28:07.769
and then you-- you get
into a hot tub with me.

28:07.977 --> 28:10.563
-Fine, I'll leave.
-[Sam] I don't want you to leave.

28:11.648 --> 28:13.358
I want you to stop being an idiot.

28:15.735 --> 28:17.737
What-- What... We're here.

28:19.406 --> 28:20.615
We're together.

28:22.075 --> 28:23.827
We should give it a shot. I...

28:29.165 --> 28:30.500
I-- I think you want to.

28:34.212 --> 28:35.338
I don't.

28:38.758 --> 28:40.427
I'm sorry if I misled you.

28:45.223 --> 28:46.641
Then what do you want, Ruth?

28:47.434 --> 28:48.476
What is it?

28:49.352 --> 28:51.688
I mean, I think we have
what everybody else is looking for.

28:51.771 --> 28:53.815
I-- I... We just had a five-hour dinner

28:53.898 --> 28:56.484
after we spent three hours at a casino.

28:57.360 --> 29:00.739
We work together all week.
And I'm not even sick of you.

29:01.281 --> 29:03.241
I mean,
I know you're trying to draw a line

29:03.324 --> 29:05.702
about when you can be in my room,
when you can't, but...

29:07.829 --> 29:09.164
but now you're here...

29:10.790 --> 29:11.958
in my hot tub.

29:14.002 --> 29:16.880
Um, this isn't your hot tub.

29:17.505 --> 29:18.882
And you're drunk.

29:19.924 --> 29:23.845
I'm... I'm not drunk. I had three...
four drinks on a full stomach.

29:23.928 --> 29:25.805
-I got a full--
-[stammers] But you do drink

29:25.889 --> 29:26.848
and you do coke.

29:26.931 --> 29:28.892
Yeah, yeah, okay, I'm not a fucking saint.

29:28.975 --> 29:29.934
And-- And you get angry.

29:30.018 --> 29:33.354
Said the perfect nun
who gets in her pajamas at 9:00

29:33.438 --> 29:35.440
and calls her boyfriend at 10:00.

29:35.774 --> 29:37.525
See? You get mean.

29:37.859 --> 29:40.445
-[Sam] Jesus. I'm not being mean.
-And--

29:41.070 --> 29:42.363
I'm frustrated.

29:42.822 --> 29:45.700
Okay? And I-- And I can't tiptoe
around this for three months.

29:45.784 --> 29:48.036
-I'll fucking implode.
-[Ruth] Sam...

29:49.287 --> 29:50.580
I love working with you.

29:51.039 --> 29:53.249
And I don't want to ruin what we have.

29:54.042 --> 29:55.043
[sighs]

29:56.544 --> 29:58.129
I'm telling you what we have.

29:59.339 --> 30:01.341
You can tell yourself whatever lie
you need to.

30:01.424 --> 30:03.384
-I'm not lying.
-Believe what you want, Ruth.

30:03.468 --> 30:05.053
You're almost twice my age.

30:07.722 --> 30:08.640
So?

30:10.099 --> 30:12.310
Is that what you were thinking about
all day?

30:12.977 --> 30:14.270
When you looked at me?

30:14.979 --> 30:16.397
That I'm fucking old?

30:18.900 --> 30:20.652
Really, Ruth? Is it?

30:22.070 --> 30:24.239
[Tammé] Ooh! Hot tub club.

30:25.490 --> 30:29.035
I love it in here.

30:29.869 --> 30:30.787
Mmm!

30:32.413 --> 30:34.332
I don't know
why more people don't take advantage.

30:35.542 --> 30:36.960
I was just getting out.

30:37.168 --> 30:40.129
[Tammé] Oh, okay. More room for me.

30:48.513 --> 30:49.347
[Sam sighs]

30:49.430 --> 30:50.515
Good night.

30:52.600 --> 30:54.227
White girls can't take the heat.

30:54.519 --> 30:56.813
[hot tub jets bubbling]

30:56.938 --> 30:57.939
Have a good day off?

31:00.650 --> 31:01.484
Uh-huh.

31:04.028 --> 31:06.865
[instrumental rock music playing]
