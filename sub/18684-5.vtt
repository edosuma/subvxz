00:23.443 --> 00:26.544
This is an FBI Black Site.

00:26.546 --> 00:28.146
Must be something big.

00:36.922 --> 00:38.490
Eric.

00:38.492 --> 00:39.991
Freddie.

00:40.716 --> 00:42.460
You're looking good.

00:43.071 --> 00:44.195
It's been, what?

00:44.783 --> 00:46.630
17 years. Ah.

00:46.632 --> 00:49.716
Freddie, this is Oliver Yates, profiler,

00:49.718 --> 00:51.136
Zara Hallam, investigations,

00:51.138 --> 00:52.637
and Maxine Carlson, my second.

00:53.162 --> 00:55.130
Team, this is
Executive Assistant Director

00:55.132 --> 00:57.823
Freddie Woods,
my old boss at the Bureau.

00:57.825 --> 00:59.806
Taught me everything I used to know.

01:01.382 --> 01:04.215
So, how can we help?

01:04.218 --> 01:05.417
Follow me.

01:10.958 --> 01:14.193
What do you guys know
about a radical political group

01:14.195 --> 01:17.429
called The Philadelphia Project?

01:17.431 --> 01:19.531
They're ethno-nationalists.

01:19.533 --> 01:21.300
They don't define themselves
as racists...

01:21.302 --> 01:23.902
just advocate for the immediate
return of all races

01:23.904 --> 01:25.437
to their ancestral homeland

01:25.439 --> 01:27.539
for the sake of human biodiversity.

01:27.541 --> 01:29.942
- Sounds pretty racist to me.
- They're racist.

01:29.944 --> 01:31.410
James Ellis...

01:31.412 --> 01:33.746
one of the top guys in the project.

01:33.748 --> 01:37.549
Came to us a few days ago
warning of a mass-casualty event

01:37.551 --> 01:38.784
that was gonna happen.

01:38.786 --> 01:40.085
Said he wanted to make a deal,

01:40.087 --> 01:41.653
but before we could
get anything in place,

01:41.655 --> 01:44.757
he and both of his lieutenants
were killed in an explosion

01:44.759 --> 01:46.291
in a makeshift bomb lab.

01:46.293 --> 01:47.526
What were they working on?

01:47.528 --> 01:48.861
We have no idea.

01:48.863 --> 01:51.063
We found a burnt SIM card at the site,

01:51.065 --> 01:52.564
but we were able to pull the name

01:52.566 --> 01:55.697
of another member of the group
off of it.

01:56.103 --> 01:58.871
Charlotte Walker, 21-year-old student

01:58.873 --> 02:01.040
at St. Christopher's College
in Manhattan.

02:01.960 --> 02:03.842
Comes from a small town in Wisconsin,

02:03.844 --> 02:06.478
has a 4.0 grade point average.

02:06.480 --> 02:08.680
Her father is a big local employer,

02:08.681 --> 02:11.116
and her mother runs the local choir

02:11.118 --> 02:13.886
at the neighborhood Baptist church.

02:13.888 --> 02:14.853
Her?

02:14.855 --> 02:17.456
We've had her here for 24 hours.

02:17.458 --> 02:19.124
We've tried everything.

02:19.126 --> 02:20.726
Everything?

02:22.329 --> 02:25.164
Yes, Ms. Hallam... everything.

02:25.166 --> 02:27.599
We flew her parents in from Wisconsin,

02:27.601 --> 02:31.270
see if we could shake her up,
but she stayed dumb.

02:31.272 --> 02:33.205
She doesn't even want a lawyer.

02:34.875 --> 02:36.508
So, what can I do?

02:36.510 --> 02:40.928
Well, little Miss Walker here
made one statement...

02:41.615 --> 02:43.715
“On Friday morning, 9:00 a.m.,

02:43.717 --> 02:46.385
the world will hear
what I've got to say”"

02:46.387 --> 02:49.952
Look, we know she's part of this.

02:50.591 --> 02:52.357
I can't get anything out of her.

02:52.359 --> 02:54.193
I thought you could take a shot.

02:54.195 --> 02:57.040
In 124 minutes or less.

02:57.331 --> 03:00.699
You know how many strings I had
to pull to get you here? Hmm?

03:03.838 --> 03:05.037
I'll run the point.

03:09.643 --> 03:11.610
Zara, dig into the research.

03:11.612 --> 03:12.878
Yeah.

03:14.148 --> 03:15.814
Let me front-load this for you.

03:15.816 --> 03:19.318
All her cellphone records,
all the background data,

03:19.320 --> 03:20.319
and we've got her laptop,

03:20.321 --> 03:21.820
but they're working on the encryption.

03:21.822 --> 03:22.721
Thank you.

03:22.723 --> 03:24.590
All right, Maxine, come with me.

03:26.727 --> 03:28.827
Maxine, I want you
questioning everything.

03:28.829 --> 03:31.222
With this time pressure,
mistakes can happen.

03:31.565 --> 03:35.100
Okay, so, first question...

03:35.102 --> 03:37.569
What's your relationship with Woods?

03:37.571 --> 03:39.004
Cute.

03:40.975 --> 03:42.341
We were close.

03:42.343 --> 03:45.577
Now... not so much.

03:45.579 --> 03:47.246
So why did he call you?

03:47.248 --> 03:49.882
'Cause the Ghostbusters
weren't available.

03:50.718 --> 03:52.651
Mr. and Mrs. Walker?

03:52.653 --> 03:54.833
Has our daughter said anything?

03:55.322 --> 03:56.321
Not yet.

03:56.323 --> 03:58.223
You're with the FBI?

03:58.225 --> 03:59.758
I used to be.

03:59.760 --> 04:01.542
We're working together on this.

04:02.830 --> 04:04.463
You have to help us, Miss.

04:04.465 --> 04:06.265
There's been a terrible mistake.

04:06.267 --> 04:08.467
My daughter is not some terrorist.

04:08.469 --> 04:09.735
I-I raised her right.

04:09.737 --> 04:11.370
I'm sure you did.

04:11.372 --> 04:13.505
She's afraid of something.

04:13.507 --> 04:15.541
That's why she won't talk to us.

04:15.543 --> 04:17.075
Must be.

04:17.077 --> 04:18.974
What do you think, Mr. Walker?

04:19.896 --> 04:23.215
Well, I-I think we sacrificed
everything for Charlotte.

04:23.217 --> 04:24.783
Gave her an education,

04:24.785 --> 04:27.558
helped pay for her college
in New York City.

04:28.022 --> 04:29.318
Now...

04:30.191 --> 04:31.854
we're here.

04:32.660 --> 04:34.126
Will you excuse us?

04:38.432 --> 04:40.165
That's the big question, right?

04:40.167 --> 04:42.434
What's a girl like that doing here?

04:42.436 --> 04:44.503
It's not the big question.
It's the only question.

04:44.505 --> 04:45.730
Work on it.

04:46.607 --> 04:48.307
What are you gonna do?

04:48.309 --> 04:49.767
I'm gonna go ask her.

04:54.081 --> 04:57.082
113 minutes until we get a surprise.

04:59.620 --> 05:01.240
Okay, we're live.

05:22.343 --> 05:26.278
You can't do anything to me
that hasn't already been done.

05:26.280 --> 05:28.885
Except give you what you want.

05:41.720 --> 05:49.738
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

05:50.750 --> 05:52.574
Is there anything I can get for you?

05:53.788 --> 05:55.328
Are you comfortable?

05:55.857 --> 05:57.657
Would you like some water?

05:57.659 --> 05:58.768
Coffee?

05:59.060 --> 06:00.674
You got to be hungry.

06:00.676 --> 06:02.495
I have Charlotte's FBI profile here.

06:02.497 --> 06:03.696
Thanks.

06:03.698 --> 06:06.065
Says she bought the
Philadelphia Project textbook

06:06.067 --> 06:08.201
and swallowed it whole.

06:08.203 --> 06:12.305
The FBI has profiled her
as a dogmatic extremist.

06:14.276 --> 06:15.308
What do you think?

06:15.310 --> 06:17.343
I don't know. Maybe they're right.

06:17.345 --> 06:19.012
But whatever they've tried up until now,

06:19.014 --> 06:20.546
it's only shut her down.

06:20.548 --> 06:22.048
She's not afraid.

06:22.050 --> 06:24.183
Okay, let's get serious.

06:24.185 --> 06:25.385
Mmm.

06:25.387 --> 06:26.853
Open up.

06:26.855 --> 06:28.621
I see that you're not feeling chatty.

06:31.259 --> 06:32.258
I'm not surprised.

06:32.260 --> 06:34.274
I'm sure the last 24 hours

06:34.896 --> 06:37.830
have been pretty suboptimal
from your point of view.

06:37.832 --> 06:40.300
Just so that we don't get off
on the wrong foot,

06:40.302 --> 06:41.367
I want to introduce myself.

06:41.369 --> 06:43.636
My name is Eric Beaumont.

06:45.473 --> 06:46.739
I would shake you by the hand,

06:46.741 --> 06:48.975
but I can see... that'd be awkward.

06:51.112 --> 06:54.731
Good manners aside, in this moment,

06:55.517 --> 06:57.283
the thing I want you to know about me

06:57.285 --> 06:58.918
is that I am not an FBI agent.

06:58.920 --> 07:03.022
In fact, I don't work
for the government at all.

07:03.024 --> 07:04.257
You don't believe me?

07:04.259 --> 07:05.834
I can prove it.

07:06.261 --> 07:09.962
You ever seen a guy on a government
salary in a shirt this nice?

07:09.964 --> 07:12.298
Handmade... in London.

07:15.236 --> 07:16.436
Tough crowd.

07:16.438 --> 07:17.870
What's he doing?

07:17.872 --> 07:19.372
He always says
a negotiator shouldn't talk

07:19.374 --> 07:20.773
more than 20% of the time.

07:20.775 --> 07:23.209
We don't have time to follow protocol.

07:23.211 --> 07:26.045
He's got to find something
she reacts to... a hot spot...

07:26.047 --> 07:27.413
draw her out, get her talking.

07:27.415 --> 07:31.484
9:00 a.m., the world will hear
what you have to say.

07:31.486 --> 07:33.019
Sounds pretty ominous.

07:33.021 --> 07:35.722
There's no chance you'll just tell me

07:35.724 --> 07:37.390
what you mean by that, is there?

07:40.061 --> 07:42.161
Well, you can't blame a guy for trying.

07:43.832 --> 07:45.298
I don't get it.

07:45.300 --> 07:48.735
How do you go from this... to that?

07:50.271 --> 07:52.038
Let's start simple.

07:52.040 --> 07:53.406
What's your name?

07:54.275 --> 07:55.942
You know my name.

07:55.944 --> 07:57.910
Okay. What's your favorite candy?

08:00.682 --> 08:03.750
Jelly beans. No way. Mine too, actually.

08:05.487 --> 08:07.854
You won't even talk to me about candy?

08:07.856 --> 08:10.022
I guess you're just following orders.

08:11.960 --> 08:14.193
Okay. Okay, look at that.

08:15.230 --> 08:17.397
We have some slight reddening
on her neck,

08:17.399 --> 08:18.631
in case you can't see it.

08:18.633 --> 08:20.433
Power struggle. Use it.

08:20.435 --> 08:22.034
It's the hot spot.

08:22.036 --> 08:24.070
Must be some very scary men
you're working for,

08:24.072 --> 08:27.540
if the idea of betraying them is
worse than a lifetime in jail.

08:29.778 --> 08:32.511
Oh, you don't...
you don't work for them?

08:32.514 --> 08:34.058
I don't...

08:34.916 --> 08:36.682
I don't understand.
I mean, you'd have to.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.484
You're 21. You're female.

08:38.486 --> 08:40.419
You can't possibly be much more
than a pretty face

08:40.422 --> 08:41.988
for the boss to look at.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.675
I know what you're doing.

08:46.194 --> 08:48.795
I've studied my enemy's techniques.

08:48.797 --> 08:50.863
Of course you do, Charlotte.

08:50.865 --> 08:51.998
You're smart.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.466
You're not a follower.

08:53.468 --> 08:56.302
You're a leader, a decision maker.

08:56.304 --> 08:58.237
And they, Charlotte,
are my favorite type of people

08:58.239 --> 09:00.239
because they're the people
you can do deals with.

09:00.241 --> 09:02.842
Everyone who has
come into this cage so far,

09:02.844 --> 09:07.313
who are watching and listening
to us right now,

09:07.315 --> 09:09.363
they've been interrogators.

09:10.452 --> 09:12.452
They've been trying to extract
information from you

09:12.454 --> 09:15.254
against your will,
but you have beaten them.

09:15.256 --> 09:17.883
So they called me...

09:18.460 --> 09:19.492
a negotiator.

09:19.494 --> 09:23.696
You can't get me what I want.

09:23.698 --> 09:28.552
The only thing I care about
in a negotiation is human life.

09:29.204 --> 09:31.204
That is the one line I will not cross,

09:31.206 --> 09:34.574
but everything... I mean,
everything else is on the table.

09:34.576 --> 09:37.940
I may not be able to give you
everything that you want...

09:39.113 --> 09:41.180
but I will get you what you need.

09:44.586 --> 09:46.118
Let me give you something.

10:07.809 --> 10:11.131
So, Charlotte, what is it you want?

10:11.980 --> 10:13.446
I want to know the time.

10:13.448 --> 10:14.714
Yes!

10:20.255 --> 10:22.054
7:36 a.m.

10:24.659 --> 10:25.758
They made an exchange.

10:25.760 --> 10:27.360
He's starting to negotiate.

10:33.935 --> 10:35.535
Are you lying about the time?

10:38.806 --> 10:39.772
No.

10:39.774 --> 10:41.207
Are you lying

10:41.209 --> 10:44.043
about something awful happening
at 9:00 a.m.?

10:44.045 --> 10:45.378
No.

10:45.380 --> 10:47.413
No, I didn't think so.

10:47.415 --> 10:52.167
And if you play by the rules,
then so do I.

10:53.021 --> 10:56.622
Now, tell me
what's gonna happen at 9:00.

11:00.295 --> 11:02.895
You know what Malcolm X said
about coffee?

11:02.897 --> 11:06.233
“It's the only thing I like integrated”"

11:07.168 --> 11:08.367
Smart man.

11:08.369 --> 11:10.168
You don't take your coffee black?

11:10.672 --> 11:12.368
You think I'm a racist.

11:13.575 --> 11:14.981
I'm not.

11:15.810 --> 11:17.443
So what do you believe?

11:17.445 --> 11:21.739
That the mixing of races
is a terrible mistake.

11:23.117 --> 11:24.747
Let me ask you.

11:25.153 --> 11:28.347
Why do they separate
women and men in the Olympics?

11:28.690 --> 11:30.856
- Tell me.
- Don't be obtuse.

11:30.858 --> 11:32.024
Okay.

11:32.026 --> 11:35.261
It's because men are stronger.
It wouldn't be fair.

11:35.263 --> 11:37.554
So why not separate the races?

11:38.032 --> 11:40.066
I mean, after all, when did you
last see a white guy

11:40.068 --> 11:41.968
win the 100-meter dash?

11:41.970 --> 11:44.370
The greatest lie
at the end of the 20th century

11:44.372 --> 11:46.872
was that race was irrelevant,
that mixing peoples

11:46.874 --> 11:49.175
of different abilities
and characteristics

11:49.177 --> 11:51.610
wouldn't have a negative effect.

11:53.014 --> 11:56.782
That you could keep a lamb
and a wolf in the same pen,

11:56.784 --> 11:59.352
and the lamb wouldn't get eaten.

11:59.354 --> 12:02.121
How is he just sitting there,
listening to this?

12:02.123 --> 12:04.323
No, he needs to keep her
talking, Maxine.

12:04.325 --> 12:07.827
If he calls her out on that
garbage, she'll just shut down.

12:07.829 --> 12:09.528
In New York City,

12:09.530 --> 12:12.665
one of the most ethnically
diverse cities in the world,

12:12.667 --> 12:14.533
go to the Grove Outreach Clinic
in Queens.

12:14.535 --> 12:16.302
You'll see terrible things.

12:16.304 --> 12:19.238
Bugs everywhere, rats.

12:19.240 --> 12:21.592
In the richest country in the world?

12:22.043 --> 12:24.510
And you're telling me
these people wouldn't do better

12:24.512 --> 12:27.313
in a country where they truly belonged?

12:27.315 --> 12:29.982
Would you forward me
those files on Charlotte?

12:29.984 --> 12:31.550
Coming your way.

12:32.687 --> 12:34.553
I just talked to the techs.

12:34.555 --> 12:35.921
They were able to crack her laptop,

12:35.923 --> 12:38.057
but the hard drive just wiped itself.

12:38.059 --> 12:39.225
What about the metadata?

12:39.227 --> 12:40.593
Yeah, I'm getting an ETA on that.

12:40.595 --> 12:42.662
All people of color
face discrimination.

12:42.664 --> 12:44.063
Oh, he's got her talking.

12:44.065 --> 12:46.565
Asian-Americans score the
highest on standardized tests

12:46.567 --> 12:47.833
- Huh.
- by a huge margin,

12:47.835 --> 12:51.337
and yet, less than 4%
of Fortune 500 CEOs

12:51.339 --> 12:53.139
are from minorities.

12:53.141 --> 12:55.241
So, if I'm understanding correctly...

12:55.243 --> 12:58.693
and please bear with me,
because I can be slow...

12:59.147 --> 13:00.946
you're saying that everybody knows

13:00.948 --> 13:02.848
that the mixing of races doesn't work,

13:02.850 --> 13:04.617
but they're too afraid to say so.

13:04.619 --> 13:06.189
Exactly.

13:06.754 --> 13:09.188
So you're just speaking the truth?

13:09.190 --> 13:10.356
Yes.

13:10.358 --> 13:11.590
If that's so,

13:12.013 --> 13:15.227
is violence... and, presumably, death...

13:15.229 --> 13:17.697
the best way
of getting people to listen?

13:17.699 --> 13:20.266
Charlotte told Mr. Beaumont
about an outreach center.

13:20.268 --> 13:24.136
The Grove Clinic is a 45-minute
subway ride from her apartment.

13:24.138 --> 13:26.238
And she's on our health insurance.

13:27.475 --> 13:29.875
Her phone records say
she called them 23 times

13:29.877 --> 13:31.343
in the last 12 months.

13:33.481 --> 13:35.614
Any idea what she might be doing
at an outreach clinic?

13:35.616 --> 13:37.814
That doesn't sound like our daughter.

13:38.186 --> 13:40.286
We don't know this girl at all.

13:41.989 --> 13:45.357
You have the full attention
of the U.S. government.

13:45.359 --> 13:48.794
Whatever you say could reach
the president in 30 seconds.

13:48.796 --> 13:51.950
I mean, considering everything
potentially at your disposal,

13:52.467 --> 13:55.334
is your plan the best way
of spreading this truth?

13:58.940 --> 14:01.674
This isn't an interrogation, Charlotte.

14:01.676 --> 14:03.542
This is an opportunity.

14:08.182 --> 14:10.282
$500 million in Bitcoin.

14:10.284 --> 14:13.753
Untraceable currency. Not stupid.

14:13.755 --> 14:15.654
We can get working on that.

14:15.656 --> 14:16.922
Open up.

14:16.924 --> 14:19.625
The people that you're
working for... the government...

14:20.313 --> 14:23.000
they know what I'm saying makes sense.

14:23.364 --> 14:26.332
They're not gonna spend
$500 million to stop me.

14:29.203 --> 14:31.604
Are you sure that your plan
is going to work?

14:31.606 --> 14:32.987
I mean...

14:33.775 --> 14:35.600
the people you're working with...

14:36.310 --> 14:38.110
blew themselves up.

14:38.112 --> 14:39.145
She's clenching her jaw.

14:39.147 --> 14:40.484
Hot spot.

14:41.415 --> 14:43.451
Or maybe it wasn't an accident.

14:43.885 --> 14:46.085
Maybe you found out
that there was an FBI informant

14:46.087 --> 14:49.246
in your group, and you felt
you had to eliminate them.

14:50.024 --> 14:51.524
Now it's just you.

14:53.261 --> 14:56.262
And the bombs I have
walking around New York City.

15:23.958 --> 15:26.992
Today we are going to be solving
quadratic equations.

15:36.357 --> 15:40.526
You have been totally
underestimated, Charlotte.

15:40.528 --> 15:41.794
It goes to “Severe”"

15:41.796 --> 15:45.631
Yes, all five boroughs,
all the transportation hubs.

15:45.633 --> 15:46.599
Yeah, yeah.

15:46.601 --> 15:49.001
Hey. They got your metadata.

15:52.974 --> 15:55.132
She said “walking around.”

15:55.710 --> 15:56.876
I mean...

15:57.211 --> 15:59.745
suicide bombers, right?

15:59.747 --> 16:01.046
Maybe.

16:06.954 --> 16:08.020
Maxine Carlson.

16:08.481 --> 16:09.937
Right now,

16:10.324 --> 16:12.625
with just over an hour to go
before the bombs go off,

16:12.627 --> 16:14.762
you have all the leverage.

16:15.663 --> 16:17.858
We're over a barrel, so...

16:18.733 --> 16:20.409
be smart.

16:21.002 --> 16:23.905
$500 million in Bitcoin.

16:24.538 --> 16:27.121
Latency's off a fraction.

16:27.708 --> 16:30.170
I don't think you're being
straight with me, Charlotte.

16:31.212 --> 16:32.845
I don't think you'd call off those bombs

16:32.847 --> 16:34.780
even if we did give you $500 million.

16:39.053 --> 16:40.450
I got something.

16:40.955 --> 16:41.987
Eric?

16:41.989 --> 16:43.789
I searched through
her Tor Browser metadata

16:43.791 --> 16:45.624
looking for some black-market sites.

16:45.626 --> 16:48.494
I found orders she placed for TATP

16:48.496 --> 16:50.963
and wireless bomb triggers.

16:50.965 --> 16:54.298
What do you mean,
“walking around New York City”?

16:54.895 --> 16:58.931
That seems strange to me...
stealing from the ISIS playbook.

17:01.342 --> 17:03.575
But, then, you're using TATP,

17:03.577 --> 17:06.291
which means the bombs are small.

17:06.914 --> 17:10.499
Her pupils are dilating...
fight-or-flight response.

17:11.551 --> 17:13.085
She's afraid now.

17:14.722 --> 17:17.388
Small, walking bombs.

17:19.359 --> 17:20.559
May I?

17:22.063 --> 17:23.095
Yeah.

17:26.300 --> 17:29.969
Eric, if she's using suicide vests,

17:29.971 --> 17:32.137
why wireless triggers?

17:33.741 --> 17:37.509
The thing is, suicide bombers
set themselves off,

17:37.511 --> 17:39.878
but you're using wireless triggers,

17:39.880 --> 17:42.514
so you're using innocent people.

17:44.819 --> 17:45.818
But how?

17:51.192 --> 17:53.659
Eric, I spoke to the clinic
and sent a photo.

17:53.661 --> 17:55.427
I just got confirmation.

17:55.429 --> 17:58.630
Last summer, she volunteered
there under a fake name.

18:00.634 --> 18:01.900
All right.

18:03.304 --> 18:04.636
I'll stop with the dumb questions.

18:04.638 --> 18:06.005
You're clearly not gonna tell me

18:06.007 --> 18:07.573
how you rigged innocent people to blow,

18:07.575 --> 18:10.809
but maybe you will tell me
why you've been volunteering

18:10.811 --> 18:12.978
at that medical center you mentioned.

18:12.980 --> 18:15.280
I mean, you got to see it
from my perspective.

18:15.282 --> 18:17.616
Seems like an awfully strange
extracurricular

18:17.618 --> 18:18.984
for a person like you.

18:20.034 --> 18:21.800
These people are poor.

18:21.889 --> 18:24.423
They eat cheap food and get diabetes.

18:24.425 --> 18:26.392
Soon, they need their feet amputated.

18:26.394 --> 18:27.760
She's deflecting.

18:27.762 --> 18:29.094
If they're lucky,

18:29.096 --> 18:31.864
they get given prosthetics
from the 1970s that don't fit,

18:31.866 --> 18:33.499
and their lives are pain.

18:33.501 --> 18:35.567
No, speech pattern is consistent.

18:35.569 --> 18:36.835
She's not making this up.

18:36.837 --> 18:39.471
Doesn't mean she's not using it
to hide something.

18:39.473 --> 18:40.472
True.

18:40.474 --> 18:42.775
These people are desperate.

18:47.381 --> 18:48.447
Open up.

18:57.091 --> 18:59.358
We got a lot of variation
on the word “desperate”"

18:59.360 --> 19:01.794
I caught it. It gave me an idea,
and not a very pleasant one.

19:01.796 --> 19:04.029
The silicone balloons
they found at the bomb lab...

19:04.031 --> 19:05.497
What did they want to use them for?

19:05.499 --> 19:07.633
Um, waterproofing, maybe.

19:07.635 --> 19:09.234
How about weight loss?

19:10.271 --> 19:11.970
Look for “the Grove Clinic” and “trial.”

19:11.972 --> 19:13.572
See what you can find.

19:18.145 --> 19:18.911
There.

19:18.913 --> 19:20.446
Intragastric balloon.

19:20.448 --> 19:21.613
I'm gonna call the clinic.

19:23.617 --> 19:24.750
Eric.

19:24.752 --> 19:26.485
Outside.

19:31.092 --> 19:32.858
I got confirmation.

19:32.860 --> 19:35.260
If she can prove the threat,
I've been authorized

19:35.262 --> 19:39.298
to offer her
$100 million cryptocurrency.

19:39.300 --> 19:40.766
Oh, it's a false demand.

19:41.802 --> 19:43.035
She's grandstanding.

19:43.037 --> 19:46.038
Then why ask for Bitcoin?
Why be so specific?

19:46.040 --> 19:47.906
Even so, what makes you think
she wouldn't just take the money

19:47.908 --> 19:49.875
and let the bombs explode anyway?

19:50.845 --> 19:52.211
No, it's a good thing.

19:52.213 --> 19:54.146
She's starting to conceptualize
other outcomes.

19:54.148 --> 19:55.214
It's the first step.

19:55.216 --> 19:57.116
I will find a common objective
between us,

19:57.118 --> 19:58.517
but money is not the answer.

19:58.519 --> 20:00.041
After all this time...

20:01.088 --> 20:02.821
and you're still so naive.

20:02.823 --> 20:05.424
You still think anybody can be reached.

20:07.962 --> 20:09.862
They're not talking about the case.

20:09.864 --> 20:12.364
They're talking about
the siege at Shiloh.

20:12.366 --> 20:15.734
You've established rapport.
She seems to trust you.

20:15.736 --> 20:18.403
There's still time to make the exchange.

20:18.405 --> 20:21.006
I'll confirm that the bombs
have been defused.

20:21.008 --> 20:25.310
Then you leave,
and I will deal with her.

20:25.312 --> 20:28.580
Remember... you and I,
we've been here before.

20:28.582 --> 20:30.816
That's right. We have been.

20:30.818 --> 20:32.784
I'm trying to find a different outcome.

20:36.824 --> 20:39.091
Woods was at Shiloh... had to have been.

20:39.093 --> 20:40.259
Maxine.

20:40.261 --> 20:43.762
Eric left the FBI in 2000,
right after Shiloh.

20:43.764 --> 20:46.231
It's the only time he's ever
lost a life in a negotiation.

20:46.233 --> 20:47.900
That was 17 years ago.

20:47.902 --> 20:49.868
That's why he and Woods
don't talk anymore.

20:49.870 --> 20:51.937
How is this relevant to our case?

20:51.939 --> 20:53.272
It might disrupt the dynamic

20:53.274 --> 20:55.774
between our team
and the client, Woods...

20:55.776 --> 20:57.209
roadblock the case.

20:57.211 --> 20:59.244
Like you're doing right now.

21:00.181 --> 21:01.246
I'm doing my job.

21:01.248 --> 21:02.548
Yeah? Couldn't tell.

21:03.717 --> 21:06.218
You know what, Oliver?
Just say it. Spit it out.

21:06.220 --> 21:08.020
You know, this is exactly
what I was worried about

21:08.022 --> 21:10.155
and the reason I didn't think
it was a good idea to hire you.

21:11.325 --> 21:13.926
Your connection to Shiloh
clouding your judgment

21:13.928 --> 21:15.994
and distracting you from a negotiation.

21:15.996 --> 21:18.764
A-Are you saying this case
is not emotional for you?

21:18.766 --> 21:21.500
Because she's talking about
sending you to Africa.

21:21.502 --> 21:23.235
Grenada, actually.

21:23.237 --> 21:24.603
But it's all the same, right?

21:24.605 --> 21:26.338
Oh, please, Oliver. Come on.

21:26.340 --> 21:29.007
At the root, you know
every case is about emotion.

21:29.009 --> 21:30.442
Guys!

21:30.444 --> 21:31.777
Ticktock.

21:49.997 --> 21:51.029
Miss me?

21:51.031 --> 21:53.352
No, not really.

21:53.767 --> 21:55.467
I had your voice to keep me company.

21:55.469 --> 21:57.736
 If
you suffer from stomach ulcers,

21:57.738 --> 21:59.238
The Grove is here to help.

21:59.240 --> 22:02.307
We will pay you $100
to take part in a medical trial

22:02.309 --> 22:03.475
which will not only heal...

22:04.645 --> 22:06.178
You hacked their patient database

22:06.180 --> 22:08.547
and sent this message to 3,000 people.

22:08.549 --> 22:09.815
I think you proved your point.

22:09.817 --> 22:12.251
You do have to be pretty vulnerable...

22:12.253 --> 22:14.052
and yes, desperate...

22:14.054 --> 22:17.153
to take part in a medical trial
for just 100 bucks.

22:18.158 --> 22:19.324
Especially a trial

22:19.326 --> 22:21.693
where someone plants a bomb
inside your stomach.

22:21.695 --> 22:23.128
Wait. What?

22:23.130 --> 22:25.564
Do we know where these people
are... who they are, even?

22:25.566 --> 22:26.865
No.

22:26.867 --> 22:28.400
Even if we did,

22:28.402 --> 22:31.503
how do you defuse a bomb that's...

22:31.505 --> 22:33.038
inside you?

22:35.876 --> 22:37.709
What time is it, Mr. Beaumont?

22:42.207 --> 22:44.642
That's right, sir... the Grove Clinic.

22:44.644 --> 22:46.010
The ulcer trial.

22:47.614 --> 22:49.080
Okay. Thank you, sir.

22:49.082 --> 22:50.114
Thank you for your time.

22:50.116 --> 22:51.367
You getting anything?

22:51.369 --> 22:52.569
No.

22:52.622 --> 22:54.388
They were selective.

22:54.390 --> 22:57.658
We've got a list of 145 callers
to this fake clinic number,

22:57.660 --> 23:00.561
and so far, everyone says they
were rejected for the trial.

23:00.563 --> 23:02.163
There's got to be a strategy.

23:02.165 --> 23:04.695
Do you wonder
how I stood up to all this?

23:05.635 --> 23:08.602
Them trying to break me.

23:12.275 --> 23:14.208
Do you know “Invictus”?

23:15.712 --> 23:19.043
Nelson Mandela memorized it
when he was on Robben Island.

23:19.068 --> 23:22.670
It helped him through
27 years of torture.

23:22.952 --> 23:25.323
“It matters not how strait the gate,

23:26.389 --> 23:29.160
how charged with punishments
the scroll.”

23:31.227 --> 23:32.626
“I am the master of my fate.

23:32.628 --> 23:35.608
I am the captain of my soul.”

23:36.032 --> 23:37.583
Are you, though?

23:38.935 --> 23:40.968
I'm not sure.

23:40.970 --> 23:43.167
You play it cool, but...

23:43.539 --> 23:46.841
I feel like there are
some emotional issues there.

23:49.645 --> 23:51.946
It's crazy how much background
the FBI can pull

23:51.948 --> 23:53.180
on the drop of a dime.

23:53.182 --> 23:55.583
The problem sometimes
is knowing what to look for.

23:55.585 --> 23:58.018
- Needle in a haystack.
- Mm-hmm.

24:00.123 --> 24:02.908
Ooh. I just pricked my finger.

24:03.593 --> 24:05.726
Good morning. I'm calling
from the Grove Clinic

24:05.728 --> 24:07.094
to follow up on your trial.

24:07.096 --> 24:08.896
Yeah, what about it?

24:11.634 --> 24:14.268
We would like to check in
on your progress.

24:14.270 --> 24:17.138
Do you have five minutes
to discuss how it's going?

24:17.140 --> 24:18.339
I guess.

24:18.341 --> 24:22.409
Um, have you experienced
any physical discomfort?

24:22.411 --> 24:24.678
Get a trace on that call.

24:24.680 --> 24:26.380
Pull him up.

24:26.382 --> 24:29.717
He's a janitor at the ZPS Bank Building.

24:29.719 --> 24:32.686
Wow. Exposure there
would be devastating.

24:33.723 --> 24:35.289
That's the strategy...

24:35.314 --> 24:36.346
high-value targets,

24:36.425 --> 24:38.259
small explosions in vulnerable places.

24:38.261 --> 24:40.261
Look, go to the lists,
build up a profile.

24:40.263 --> 24:42.897
Let's see... Let's see
who else she'd pick.

24:44.734 --> 24:46.167
Get me Tactical.

24:47.290 --> 24:48.856
You got something?

24:50.125 --> 24:51.258
Eric?

24:51.374 --> 24:54.275
I did some digging
into Charlotte's mother.

24:54.277 --> 24:57.478
She's spent a total of 8 months
over the past 10 years

24:57.480 --> 25:00.080
in various mental-health institutions.

25:00.082 --> 25:04.685
She's currently on some
pretty heavy mood stabilizers.

25:04.687 --> 25:06.387
Charlotte wants to portray her motives

25:06.389 --> 25:08.622
as purely rational and logical.

25:08.624 --> 25:11.125
What if there's something
emotional driving her?

25:13.455 --> 25:14.855
Charlotte.

25:17.133 --> 25:18.532
Tell me about your family.

25:18.534 --> 25:20.134
Oh, don't try that.

25:21.103 --> 25:23.549
You know they brought my parents.

25:24.574 --> 25:27.474
“Do you know what you're doing
to your parents?”

25:27.476 --> 25:29.176
She's playing casual,

25:29.178 --> 25:32.112
but this is definitely a hot spot, Eric.

25:32.114 --> 25:33.981
- Does that bother you?
- No.

25:33.983 --> 25:35.482
They even tried to claim

25:35.484 --> 25:37.651
that my parents came here to help them.

25:39.889 --> 25:42.723
And you... you don't believe that?

25:42.725 --> 25:44.992
My parents aren't really
the type of people

25:44.994 --> 25:46.428
that can, uh...

25:47.363 --> 25:49.036
face the truth.

25:49.298 --> 25:51.332
Huge variation here.

25:51.334 --> 25:52.596
Huge.

25:53.302 --> 25:54.635
I don't understand.

25:54.637 --> 25:57.651
My dad was the type of guy that...

25:58.040 --> 26:02.009
he hid a bottle of vodka
in the toilet tank at church.

26:02.011 --> 26:06.113
Maybe look you in the eye
if it was your birthday.

26:07.583 --> 26:08.983
And your mother?

26:09.031 --> 26:10.764
Oh, she...

26:10.920 --> 26:12.904
she just kept smiling...

26:14.423 --> 26:16.190
and singing.

26:16.192 --> 26:18.492
It's people like that...
people that just pretend

26:18.494 --> 26:22.062
like everything is perfect
while their insides rot

26:22.064 --> 26:24.725
and everything else around them burns.

26:24.752 --> 26:26.752
_

26:27.403 --> 26:28.369
Right.

26:30.473 --> 26:31.372
Open up.

26:35.578 --> 26:38.112
We have about 500 photographs
we need you to look at.

26:38.114 --> 26:42.311
Um, childhood friends, uh...

26:42.336 --> 26:45.104
uh... friendships at school...

26:50.860 --> 26:52.860
I know you don't want
to believe it, but your daughter

26:52.862 --> 26:56.630
is about to be responsible
for something truly awful.

26:58.668 --> 27:01.335
She's planted bombs
inside innocent people

27:01.337 --> 27:03.203
and rigged them to blow
in about a half-hour.

27:04.273 --> 27:06.140
But I can stop it.

27:06.142 --> 27:08.394
I can save her from herself.

27:09.178 --> 27:10.577
If you help me.

27:10.579 --> 27:12.455
What can I do?

27:13.716 --> 27:15.578
You can tell me the truth.

27:16.018 --> 27:18.794
Why is Charlotte so fixated by race?

27:19.322 --> 27:21.522
What's driving her to do these things?

27:24.827 --> 27:27.294
Please tell me before it is too late.

27:30.499 --> 27:31.749
I was young...

27:32.635 --> 27:35.436
and newly married.

27:35.438 --> 27:37.304
Have there been any changes in your mood

27:37.306 --> 27:38.973
since the clinical trial?

27:38.975 --> 27:40.941
Is this gonna take much longer?

27:40.943 --> 27:42.176
Get down on your knees!

27:43.813 --> 27:45.713
Clear the area!

27:45.715 --> 27:46.647
What's going on?!

27:46.649 --> 27:48.749
Please. Just stay calm.

27:48.751 --> 27:50.017
Hands on your head!

27:51.754 --> 27:53.087
I didn't do anything!

27:53.089 --> 27:55.189
They're just gonna shoot him?!

27:57.626 --> 27:59.126
Hey, hey, hey! Hey!

28:01.430 --> 28:02.830
You're gonna help him, right?

28:02.832 --> 28:04.665
You can't shoot that man.

28:05.149 --> 28:07.034
He's innocent.

28:07.036 --> 28:08.769
So was Jessica Ford.

28:10.539 --> 28:12.773
What do you know about Jessica Ford?

28:12.775 --> 28:15.743
Target's acquired. Please advise.

28:15.745 --> 28:17.778
She was my mother.

28:17.780 --> 28:20.114
You were in command at the Shiloh siege.

28:20.116 --> 28:23.817
You got Tactical too close,
built too much pressure.

28:24.380 --> 28:26.086
You got her killed.

28:26.922 --> 28:29.823
We saved 38 souls that day.

28:29.825 --> 28:31.461
And you lost one.

28:32.928 --> 28:34.128
Not again.

28:36.786 --> 28:37.885
Red Team, on my call.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.601
Executive Assistant Director Woods.

28:42.271 --> 28:44.938
Just... contain him.

28:45.207 --> 28:46.607
Evacuate the area,

28:46.609 --> 28:48.542
get in whatever support teams
that you can,

28:48.544 --> 28:50.744
but Eric will find a way.

28:51.861 --> 28:53.727
Trust your judgment.

28:53.752 --> 28:56.022
You know how good he is.

28:57.687 --> 28:59.687
It's why you called him.

29:03.976 --> 29:06.910
Red Team, hold until further notice.

29:08.697 --> 29:10.397
Stand down!

29:29.351 --> 29:31.849
I wanted to say, but...

29:32.320 --> 29:35.288
it's really not something
we ever talk about.

29:35.290 --> 29:38.391
I didn't know if it would help or...

29:38.393 --> 29:39.392
I understand.

29:40.795 --> 29:42.261
You did the right thing.

29:43.798 --> 29:45.164
Excuse me.

29:49.583 --> 29:51.717
You sick son of a...

29:53.508 --> 29:54.974
Jessica Ford.

29:56.778 --> 29:58.311
Are you so damaged,

29:58.313 --> 30:00.646
you had to hire
the daughter of a dead woman

30:00.648 --> 30:02.015
to ease your conscience?

30:02.017 --> 30:03.316
Maybe.

30:05.387 --> 30:07.587
I think about Shiloh
every minute of every day,

30:07.589 --> 30:09.589
Every time I work a case,
I am back there,

30:09.591 --> 30:12.876
trying to fix it,
trying to get her back.

30:13.995 --> 30:15.528
But, Freddie...

30:17.899 --> 30:19.632
...we got people
walking around Manhattan

30:19.634 --> 30:21.100
with bombs in their bodies,

30:21.102 --> 30:23.028
and, broken as I am,

30:23.371 --> 30:25.671
I'm the only one who can save them.

30:41.497 --> 30:44.164
Charlotte, how do you feel
about Larry Walker?

30:46.872 --> 30:48.905
Did you notice I called him Larry Walker

30:48.907 --> 30:50.373
and not your father?

30:52.544 --> 30:54.477
'Cause he isn't your father, is he?

30:55.173 --> 30:56.913
Not biologically.

30:58.216 --> 30:59.816
This man is.

31:02.187 --> 31:04.321
His name is Nate Bridges.

31:05.223 --> 31:07.390
But you already knew that, of course.

31:07.960 --> 31:10.293
Your mother told me that she met
your biological father

31:10.295 --> 31:12.796
on a choir trip to Boston,

31:12.798 --> 31:14.864
said she'd never met a man like him.

31:17.102 --> 31:19.903
Never felt a connection
to another human being quite like it.

31:19.905 --> 31:22.005
She was going to leave Larry,

31:22.007 --> 31:24.341
but when she got home, she got scared.

31:24.343 --> 31:27.510
She confessed, begged forgiveness,

31:27.512 --> 31:29.688
swore never to talk to Nate again.

31:30.582 --> 31:33.016
Larry agreed to raise you as his own,

31:33.018 --> 31:35.885
as long as it was a secret.

31:35.887 --> 31:37.753
So, I am curious...

31:38.357 --> 31:39.872
How did you find out?

31:41.280 --> 31:43.159
He screamed it at me one night
when he was drunk

31:43.161 --> 31:44.889
and I had knocked over a vase.

31:45.430 --> 31:47.330
I was 11 years old.

31:47.332 --> 31:48.898
He should ask for a concession.

31:48.900 --> 31:50.100
No, she's not ready yet.

31:50.102 --> 31:51.901
So, then, you knew.

31:53.105 --> 31:56.212
It explained it all, right?

31:57.042 --> 31:59.075
The way Larry would
look at you... or not.

31:59.077 --> 32:01.057
You were another man's child...

32:01.546 --> 32:04.481
a black man's child.

32:05.884 --> 32:09.052
And you never thought to try
and get ahold of your real father?

32:09.054 --> 32:12.188
No. You were afraid
that he would reject you, too.

32:12.190 --> 32:13.606
So I'm wondering...

32:13.608 --> 32:15.525
How did it happen?

32:16.661 --> 32:19.696
All those... feelings

32:19.698 --> 32:21.831
of worthlessness and self-hatred...

32:22.576 --> 32:24.567
when did it turn into all this?

32:25.043 --> 32:27.003
You're new in the city,
it's overwhelming,

32:27.005 --> 32:29.272
you... you don't make many friends,

32:29.274 --> 32:31.041
you spend a lot of time on the Internet,

32:31.043 --> 32:33.510
you start reading Richard B.
Spencer, Nicholas Wade,

32:33.512 --> 32:36.546
and before you know it,
you've got a cause...

32:36.548 --> 32:39.682
a way to prove to the world,
Larry Walker, and yourself

32:39.684 --> 32:41.451
that you are not nothing.

32:41.453 --> 32:45.455
But, Charlotte,
you set this chaos loose,

32:45.457 --> 32:46.990
you'll still be you.

32:48.060 --> 32:49.793
You'll still feel the same way

32:49.795 --> 32:52.395
because race and multiculturalism

32:52.397 --> 32:53.863
are not your issue.

32:53.865 --> 32:55.432
They never were.

32:56.668 --> 32:59.231
Larry Walker is your issue.

32:59.838 --> 33:02.739
Eric, now. Press for a concession.

33:06.378 --> 33:09.143
There are 12 minutes left, Charlotte.

33:10.048 --> 33:11.714
Still time to make a deal.

33:13.618 --> 33:15.685
Let's go disable some bombs.

33:18.256 --> 33:19.722
No.

33:27.466 --> 33:29.032
Hey.

33:29.034 --> 33:30.600
Oliver, patch me in to Eric.

33:33.238 --> 33:35.171
Eric, we identified

33:35.173 --> 33:37.874
four high-value targets
from the trial volunteer list...

33:37.876 --> 33:40.577
the janitor that we know about,
a subway worker,

33:40.579 --> 33:43.480
a high-school teacher,
and a hospital care worker.

33:43.482 --> 33:46.583
But, Eric, they bought five triggers.

33:46.585 --> 33:47.884
There's one bomb missing.

33:50.489 --> 33:54.124
Zara, tell Freddie Woods
to send Larry Walker to me...

33:54.126 --> 33:55.225
right now.

34:22.621 --> 34:23.652
Open up.

34:34.933 --> 34:36.766
Evacuate all personnel.

34:46.378 --> 34:47.911
What is happening?

34:56.221 --> 35:00.990
Mr. Walker, in just under
five minutes' time,

35:00.992 --> 35:02.825
bombs that have been planted
by your daughter

35:02.827 --> 35:06.196
in the stomach of innocent
people are going to explode,

35:06.198 --> 35:08.598
killing them
and potentially many others.

35:10.101 --> 35:12.302
Our working theory is that

35:12.304 --> 35:14.804
a deeply unhappy and unloving
family dynamic

35:14.806 --> 35:17.473
has mutated in Charlotte

35:17.475 --> 35:20.534
to create a self-loathing
that she is trying to alleviate

35:21.279 --> 35:23.638
with a spectacular act of terrorism.

35:24.115 --> 35:25.830
Unfortunately for you...

35:26.451 --> 35:28.284
and me...

35:28.286 --> 35:30.286
the only person
she hates more than herself

35:30.288 --> 35:32.555
is the man she blames
for letting it all happen.

35:33.458 --> 35:35.491
Clear the building... right now! Out!

35:35.493 --> 35:37.093
Everybody out! Come on!

35:37.095 --> 35:39.495
Hustle! Go!

35:42.467 --> 35:43.933
You're not coming?

35:43.935 --> 35:45.235
No.

35:46.871 --> 35:48.705
Please, please, please, Bunny...

35:48.707 --> 35:50.306
Don't call me that.

35:50.308 --> 35:51.998
You spineless worm.

35:52.544 --> 35:54.143
So weak.

35:54.145 --> 35:56.212
You raised another man's baby
as your own

35:56.214 --> 35:58.774
instead of admitting
how much you hated it.

35:59.417 --> 36:01.284
A man so pathetic,

36:01.286 --> 36:03.319
you can spike his whiskey

36:03.321 --> 36:05.288
and shove an explosive down his throat

36:05.290 --> 36:07.023
without any trouble at all.

36:14.566 --> 36:16.432
You ruined my life.

36:16.434 --> 36:20.136
And unlike you,
I don't ignore my problems.

36:20.138 --> 36:22.205
I solve them.

36:23.708 --> 36:25.575
I've been here before.

36:28.513 --> 36:30.013
17 years ago, in fact.

36:30.015 --> 36:32.548
I saw another woman...
young, like yourself...

36:32.550 --> 36:35.418
who was ready to die for a cause

36:35.860 --> 36:38.154
and kill innocent people
at the same time.

36:38.580 --> 36:40.990
When I looked into her eyes,
I could see that it was true.

36:40.992 --> 36:43.993
I... I couldn't convince her
to turn back.

36:43.995 --> 36:47.030
When I look at you,
I don't see the same thing.

36:54.973 --> 36:56.623
Do you know the name...

36:57.642 --> 36:59.142
Jessica Ford?

37:02.347 --> 37:03.146
No.

37:03.148 --> 37:04.480
Exactly.

37:04.482 --> 37:06.198
You can die today,

37:06.651 --> 37:08.951
take your father with you...
and others...

37:09.286 --> 37:11.187
and it'll be for nothing.

37:11.189 --> 37:14.150
No one will ever even know
why you did it.

37:14.726 --> 37:16.025
You'll be forgotten.

37:16.027 --> 37:19.462
And worse... he'll win.

37:22.867 --> 37:25.868
You'll be the outcast
that he raised you to be.

37:25.870 --> 37:28.338
All that pain in your heart,
the hatred...

37:28.340 --> 37:29.961
that's not yours.

37:30.408 --> 37:31.607
That's his.

37:32.048 --> 37:33.843
Charlotte.

37:35.647 --> 37:37.680
Let it go.

37:52.997 --> 37:54.931
Can I have your phone?

37:56.167 --> 37:57.942
To defuse the bombs?

37:59.104 --> 38:00.870
There's an online switch.

38:00.872 --> 38:02.338
Don't trust her.

38:02.340 --> 38:04.240
Here.

38:30.235 --> 38:31.801
Back up!

39:00.498 --> 39:02.231
Come on.

39:02.233 --> 39:03.566
Go, go, go!

39:17.816 --> 39:19.282
Bunny.

39:28.393 --> 39:29.792
I'm sorry.

39:29.794 --> 39:33.162
I'm sorry I didn't protect you from him.

40:09.934 --> 40:11.510
Good job today.

40:11.970 --> 40:13.454
Is it true?

40:14.572 --> 40:16.672
What you said about my mom...

40:16.674 --> 40:19.475
that she was gonna do something awful?

40:19.477 --> 40:22.945
Maxine, your mother knew
that if you stayed with her...

40:23.915 --> 40:27.111
So she sent you to live
in your aunt's house...

40:28.319 --> 40:30.319
and you thrived.

40:34.792 --> 40:36.425
Your mother loved you, Maxine.

40:36.427 --> 40:39.646
Whatever else she might have
done, she would be proud of you.

40:40.198 --> 40:41.623
Of who you've become.

40:44.823 --> 40:47.537
We've located the other three,

40:47.539 --> 40:49.447
and they're being prepped...

40:50.108 --> 40:52.408
very carefully... for surgery.

41:12.864 --> 41:14.397
How's your family?

41:14.399 --> 41:16.265
Good. Uh...

41:16.267 --> 41:18.834
T-The youngest is, uh...

41:20.705 --> 41:24.340
...she's... just off to college.

41:24.342 --> 41:25.708
Time flies.

41:25.710 --> 41:27.109
Yeah.

41:27.111 --> 41:28.978
How's that cocker spaniel you had?

41:28.980 --> 41:32.148
The one with the... weird leg?

41:32.150 --> 41:34.383
Dead a couple years now.

41:35.420 --> 41:36.928
Miss him.

41:37.655 --> 41:39.555
Miss him a lot.

41:51.636 --> 41:52.802
We did good today.

41:52.804 --> 41:54.837
- Yeah, we did good.
- Yeah.

42:05.683 --> 42:07.583
You guys want to ride home together?

42:08.286 --> 42:09.885
Absolutely.

42:11.022 --> 42:13.356
Great. We can play “I Spy.”
