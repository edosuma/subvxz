00:02.441 --> 00:04.461
This is amazing, Oskie.

00:04.622 --> 00:06.056
I love it.

00:06.091 --> 00:09.436
Alice is here, Phoebe's missing
sister, the restoring demon.

00:09.457 --> 00:10.565
Alice...?

00:10.695 --> 00:12.248
- What is that?
- It's not glowing.

00:12.269 --> 00:14.306
- There's no danger?
- I don't understand it.

00:14.327 --> 00:16.375
In this universe,
she's not into you.

00:16.488 --> 00:18.805
If only she could see
what I can do.

00:28.064 --> 00:31.287
Are you crazy? What are you doing?
Everyone could have seen that.

00:31.570 --> 00:33.363
Hey, Andy, give it back!

00:33.481 --> 00:35.255
<i>You can control everything.</i>

00:35.276 --> 00:36.378
Who said that?

00:36.399 --> 00:37.521
<i>Say the spell!</i>

00:37.548 --> 00:39.983
- Andy, stop!
- I have the power now.

00:40.076 --> 00:42.068
Andy!

00:42.502 --> 00:44.514
Andy!

01:32.808 --> 01:35.784
- Andy, no!
- Andy! Andy!

01:35.823 --> 01:39.040
- Andy! Andy?
- Andy? Come back!

01:39.247 --> 01:42.184
- I did not see what I just saw.
- What was that spell?

01:42.205 --> 01:43.935
And what was he doing with it?

01:45.397 --> 01:49.867
- Andy, can you hear me?
- He got sucked into the sky, doofus!

01:49.896 --> 01:51.059
How could this happen?

01:51.080 --> 01:54.215
Looks like Andy was using magic he
didn't understand and couldn't control.

01:54.236 --> 01:57.422
Yeah, <i>your</i> magic, from <i>your</i>
Book of Shadows - so reliable.

01:57.443 --> 02:00.378
That wasn't my spell!
I don't know where he got it.

02:00.530 --> 02:02.662
It doesn't look like
one of these either.

02:03.314 --> 02:07.544
- So where is he now?
- He could be anywhere or...

02:07.876 --> 02:09.268
Nowhere.

02:10.273 --> 02:11.941
I don't know.

02:13.360 --> 02:15.084
Felix, you always know.

02:15.104 --> 02:17.487
- There's always a plan.
- Give me a second.

02:17.508 --> 02:20.715
No, we need to get Andy back
before anyone realises he's gone.

02:20.751 --> 02:23.703
- His parents, the reporters...
- All will freak if he's missing again.

02:23.724 --> 02:26.764
- I know.
- OK. What about an unmaking spell?

02:26.785 --> 02:29.542
Unmaking spells are
too hard to control, but...

02:29.667 --> 02:31.060
But what?

02:31.080 --> 02:34.915
Maybe something like it.
Maybe a reversal spell.

02:35.064 --> 02:36.864
We'll need something to sacrifice.

02:37.028 --> 02:40.376
Like... a human sacrifice? Dude!

02:40.397 --> 02:42.952
No, something Andy
really cares about.

02:43.222 --> 02:44.581
Chicken feet!

02:45.936 --> 02:47.866
What? They don't taste as bad
as you think.

02:47.887 --> 02:49.433
Like we did with the spell
that cured our mums.

02:49.454 --> 02:50.684
Exactly.

02:50.705 --> 02:53.069
OK. You guys find something
Andy would never give up.

02:53.086 --> 02:54.745
I'll try and figure out
what his spell was.

02:54.766 --> 02:56.088
Let's go.

03:06.624 --> 03:10.088
Hi! Where are you going?
You're not well.

03:10.108 --> 03:12.562
Is the main street as dull as
it used to be?

03:12.635 --> 03:16.324
- You're supposed to be resting.
- Oh, Phoebe, stop worrying.

03:16.345 --> 03:18.249
We could do some shopping.

03:18.779 --> 03:22.763
We're just going to pretend
the last ten years didn't happen?

03:25.546 --> 03:28.903
- I know it was hard on you.
- 'Hard' doesn't come close.

03:29.045 --> 03:32.025
The way you disappeared
in that forest without a trace...

03:32.046 --> 03:34.569
You don't know what
that was for me.

03:35.408 --> 03:39.100
- It's not gonna happen again.
- You bet it isn't.

03:39.264 --> 03:41.558
That's why we're putting
magic behind us.

03:42.449 --> 03:44.021
I'm back.

03:44.324 --> 03:48.348
I want to move forward,
make a fresh start.

03:49.752 --> 03:51.346
Please...

03:52.056 --> 03:53.426
For me?

03:54.928 --> 03:58.280
Look at you - suddenly
all sunshine and fresh starts.

03:58.678 --> 03:59.901
Come on.

04:09.952 --> 04:13.293
- I think Felix is acting weird.
- Define 'weird.'

04:13.667 --> 04:17.312
- OK - more weird.
- He's been back, what, a day?

04:19.060 --> 04:23.063
Ellen, hi.
Fun party, huh?

04:23.783 --> 04:26.178
Yeah, so much fun.

04:27.041 --> 04:29.076
OK. I just wanted
to ask if maybe...

04:29.092 --> 04:32.350
Since when do I have 'approachable'
stamped on my forehead?

04:32.664 --> 04:34.823
Have you seen Sam, yes or no?

04:34.863 --> 04:36.859
I'd know where your
boyfriend is because...?

04:36.880 --> 04:39.646
Because my boyfriend seems to have
a man crush on <i>your</i> boyfriend.

04:39.667 --> 04:41.851
Felix is not my <i>boyfriend</i>.

04:42.262 --> 04:44.129
Whatever. Forget it.

04:49.060 --> 04:51.924
We're just seeing a movie
because I...

04:51.945 --> 04:54.081
He's not my boyfriend.

04:54.437 --> 04:55.537
Right.

05:00.842 --> 05:02.562
Keep out of sight.

05:03.647 --> 05:06.253
Dude, the party sounds awesome.

05:06.290 --> 05:09.744
Seriously? We've got to
get to Andy's, remember?

05:09.765 --> 05:11.781
I'm just saying.

05:12.026 --> 05:13.923
- Hey!
- I'm on it.

05:17.514 --> 05:19.028
Sam?

05:20.068 --> 05:22.916
- Hey, babe.
- Why are you whispering?

05:24.017 --> 05:25.462
No reason.

05:25.483 --> 05:27.681
Look, I think it's sweet
that you're jealous.

05:27.702 --> 05:28.913
Jealous?!

05:30.068 --> 05:31.871
I'm not jealous!

05:31.933 --> 05:34.162
So you see me talking
to another guy,

05:34.183 --> 05:36.807
then you disappear, and the two
things aren't connected at all?

05:36.828 --> 05:37.928
No!

05:39.637 --> 05:41.905
- I'm...
- Hurry up, dude!

05:42.092 --> 05:45.735
Look, I know talking about our relationship
isn't your idea of fun, but...

05:45.756 --> 05:49.030
It's so fun! I totally think it's fun.
I'll be back soon.

05:49.051 --> 05:51.263
- I promise, we'll talk.
- Sam!

05:51.295 --> 05:53.651
I've got to go. Bye.

05:56.638 --> 05:58.886
Sam! Come on.

06:03.024 --> 06:05.578
Andy, where are you...?

06:10.235 --> 06:13.633
Come back, come back, come back.

06:15.634 --> 06:18.678
Come on, Andy.
What have you done?

06:23.790 --> 06:26.775
Locked. Doesn't look
like anyone's home.

06:26.796 --> 06:30.769
When a girl wants to talk about your re-
lationship, it's never a good thing, right?

06:30.790 --> 06:32.079
Focus.

06:32.100 --> 06:35.261
Dude! She's gonna break up with me
and there's nothing I can do about it!

06:35.282 --> 06:36.903
Probably.

06:36.924 --> 06:38.697
Seriously? You're not helping.

06:38.718 --> 06:41.718
Priorities, Sam. We need
to get inside, remember?

06:41.792 --> 06:44.752
I know. You're right.
You're right!

06:44.773 --> 06:46.253
Any ideas?

06:46.548 --> 06:49.275
- I'll superpower it open.
- Really?

06:49.851 --> 06:51.614
I've totally got this.

07:13.609 --> 07:16.098
Summer breeze. Impressive.

07:16.337 --> 07:18.082
Oh, you can do better?

07:18.103 --> 07:20.804
By getting the door open?
Yeah, pretty much.

07:20.825 --> 07:24.053
You're all doubty now, but once I get
the hang of this superpower stuff,

07:24.059 --> 07:25.839
stand by for all kinds
of awesomeness.

07:25.860 --> 07:29.729
- Dude, seriously?
- It's not that kind of rock.

07:30.004 --> 07:31.359
Key hider.

07:37.235 --> 07:42.010
These aren't the right words.
Where did you get that random spell?

07:43.819 --> 07:46.826
How could someone so smart
be so dumb?

07:46.847 --> 07:48.576
Who's so smart?

07:48.626 --> 07:49.839
Mia.

07:49.919 --> 07:52.871
- Hey. I was just...
- Talking to yourself?

07:52.892 --> 07:55.872
That seem crazy?
It does, doesn't it?

07:55.893 --> 07:57.546
A little bit.

07:58.381 --> 08:00.393
What are you doing out here?

08:00.691 --> 08:03.675
Parties aren't really my thing.

08:03.695 --> 08:05.707
- Was Sam with you?
- Nope.

08:05.727 --> 08:10.279
- We just had a weird phone conversation.
- Haven't seen him. So...

08:16.519 --> 08:18.833
Did something happen
when you guys were away?

08:18.939 --> 08:22.157
- Like what?
- I don't know...

08:22.675 --> 08:24.309
He just seems different.

08:24.365 --> 08:27.487
It was intense. Still is, sort of.

08:27.565 --> 08:32.148
That's what I wanted to talk to him about,
that, and what's going on between us.

08:33.236 --> 08:35.426
Overshare. Sorry.

08:36.215 --> 08:38.832
If I see him, I'll tell him
you're looking for him.

08:38.881 --> 08:40.299
Thanks, Felix.

08:44.707 --> 08:48.715
Straight to voicemail,
but I'm sure he'll be back soon.

08:50.715 --> 08:56.679
I get why he bailed on the party,
but he usually bails with me.

08:56.699 --> 09:00.971
I guess he's just bonded with those
guys while they were missing.

09:01.202 --> 09:05.103
One minute, he's asking me out,
next minute, he's nowhere.

09:05.124 --> 09:06.671
Boys don't make sense.

09:06.691 --> 09:09.422
It's probably best
not to think about it too much.

09:09.443 --> 09:11.427
You think I'm overthinking it?

09:11.647 --> 09:13.655
- I, um...
- You're right.

09:13.675 --> 09:16.291
Better to just ask him
straight out.

09:18.683 --> 09:21.033
Capital of Nerdtown.

09:24.679 --> 09:26.683
- Mm!
- Bear Grylls?

09:31.549 --> 09:33.738
Or this? That's Olympiad.

09:35.277 --> 09:38.361
Come on, Andy.
What do you really care about?

09:47.952 --> 09:49.312
Look.

09:57.778 --> 10:00.770
Dude - 'You plus me equals love.'

10:00.786 --> 10:04.619
- The other Ellen gave it to Andy.
- That's so lame!

10:04.640 --> 10:07.367
What are you guys doing in here?

10:08.084 --> 10:10.084
Viv, right?

10:10.104 --> 10:12.746
Did you change your hair?
Looking good.

10:12.767 --> 10:15.590
- I'll scream.
- Look, we can explain.

10:15.722 --> 10:18.095
Or we could just go.

10:19.915 --> 10:21.670
Stop them!

10:21.691 --> 10:23.723
Hey, what you doing here?

10:24.088 --> 10:26.040
Come back!

10:26.056 --> 10:29.080
What you doing in my house? Stop!

10:29.096 --> 10:30.785
Hey!

10:31.835 --> 10:33.156
I'm calling Mum.

10:33.177 --> 10:36.084
Stupid boys. Cracked my face.

10:42.414 --> 10:44.943
Hey. Before,
I might have been a bit...

10:44.964 --> 10:46.908
Rude, nasty?

10:47.032 --> 10:48.376
I was in a bad mood.

10:48.397 --> 10:50.489
You've been in a bad mood
since kindergarten.

10:51.762 --> 10:54.290
Look, We don't have to be friends
just 'cause the boys are.

10:54.311 --> 10:55.471
Obviously.

10:58.243 --> 11:02.187
- Didn't find Sam?
- No. I saw Felix, though.

11:02.207 --> 11:05.837
- Where?
- Ten minutes that way, near some trees.

11:05.987 --> 11:08.199
Could you be
a little more specific?

11:08.219 --> 11:10.957
I don't know. There were trees
around, lots of them.

11:10.978 --> 11:12.846
Do you think you could show me?

11:12.911 --> 11:15.871
I didn't think
you would chase after a guy.

11:15.892 --> 11:19.670
- I'm so not that kind of girl.
- Neither am I.

11:25.035 --> 11:26.771
Did you get something?

11:27.235 --> 11:29.406
- No sign of Andy?
- Nothing.

11:29.427 --> 11:30.844
How about this?

11:33.029 --> 11:35.751
'You plus me equals love.'

11:36.288 --> 11:37.878
It so doesn't add up.

11:37.899 --> 11:40.353
Andy brought it all the way home
from the other universe.

11:40.374 --> 11:42.174
He's really into Ellen, isn't he?

11:42.583 --> 11:45.342
- Way to rub it in!
- Rub what in?

11:48.231 --> 11:51.329
- Do you think it will work?
- I hope so.

11:55.174 --> 11:57.535
__

12:00.953 --> 12:05.271
Dude! You could've mentioned something about
the tearing-up part. Andy's gonna freak!

12:07.529 --> 12:12.051
Elements that speak as one, recant
their voice, their will undone.

12:15.498 --> 12:19.725
Elements that speak as one, recant
their voice, their will undone.

12:22.597 --> 12:24.200
You sure you're saying it right?

12:24.238 --> 12:26.376
Come on. Come on.

12:27.235 --> 12:30.319
- Bowm, bowm!
- And Plan B is...?

12:31.779 --> 12:34.906
Phoebe? She knows more about magic
than any of us.

12:35.152 --> 12:36.371
What, we go back again?

12:36.392 --> 12:38.101
She doesn't want anything to do
with us, remember?

12:38.122 --> 12:39.716
So we change her mind.

12:40.919 --> 12:43.068
And hope Alice hasn't got to her.

12:50.692 --> 12:52.508
There she is!

12:52.583 --> 12:54.084
Phoebe!

12:55.128 --> 12:57.936
- Go away.
- Andy cast a spell that went wrong.

12:57.957 --> 13:00.660
Got turned into a water-something
and got sucked up into a vortex.

13:00.680 --> 13:02.005
I tried to reverse it, but...

13:02.026 --> 13:05.676
What part of 'go away' are you not
getting, the 'go' or the 'away'?

13:06.423 --> 13:08.632
If we had Alice's
Book of Shadows...

13:09.656 --> 13:13.165
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You had it in your magic shop.

13:13.684 --> 13:15.740
I threw out all that rubbish.

13:17.452 --> 13:19.243
So what do we do now?

13:19.433 --> 13:20.688
Panic?

13:20.954 --> 13:23.394
I know why
your spell didn't work.

13:23.569 --> 13:24.817
Stay away from us.

13:24.838 --> 13:26.950
You're missing a Water element,
aren't you?

13:27.138 --> 13:29.739
- Whoa, how did you know?
- What are you talking about?

13:29.760 --> 13:32.362
If you cast it again with Andy's
elemental presence...

13:32.383 --> 13:35.573
- His what now?
- Why would we trust you?

13:35.669 --> 13:37.386
You tried to destroy us.

13:37.751 --> 13:40.807
You think I'm something
I'm not, Felix.

13:40.986 --> 13:43.090
I'm not a threat.

13:47.922 --> 13:51.942
- Yeah? Well, why take the risk?
- Felix, if she can find Andy...

13:51.962 --> 13:57.271
Look, I know how hard it was on Phoebe,
with me being away. I want to help.

13:57.803 --> 14:00.262
Felix...
Listen to her.

14:01.950 --> 14:03.994
What choice do we have?

14:05.954 --> 14:08.921
OK. Where do we start?

14:09.333 --> 14:12.316
With a spell that conjures
the missing element.

14:12.430 --> 14:15.725
I found them in Andy's room,
and then they took off.

14:15.900 --> 14:17.940
Jake Riles and the Conte boy?

14:18.197 --> 14:21.530
- What did they take?
- Nothing that we know of.

14:21.551 --> 14:23.483
Mm. Almonds, eh?

14:23.504 --> 14:26.039
You don't seem to be taking this
very seriously.

14:27.310 --> 14:31.755
So his friends were here,
but they didn't take anything,

14:31.946 --> 14:35.504
and Andy's not so much missing
as at a party?

14:35.525 --> 14:37.690
I've rung and rung.
He always calls back.

14:37.711 --> 14:40.554
- I warned him - bad spirits.
- Nainai, stop.

14:40.829 --> 14:42.207
Something's
not right.

14:42.228 --> 14:45.220
What's the bet he's just out being
a standard-issue teenager?

14:45.236 --> 14:47.363
Not my son. He's not like that.

14:47.439 --> 14:50.224
He's been different
since he got back.

14:55.084 --> 14:58.335
Alright. Why don't I go down there
and put your mind at ease?

14:58.355 --> 15:00.207
- I'm coming too.
- Vivian, I don't think...

15:00.228 --> 15:01.523
I'm going.

15:02.415 --> 15:04.062
Thanks for the biscuit.

15:05.870 --> 15:07.428
I just take these.

15:11.180 --> 15:13.380
She couldn't take her eyes off
the talisman.

15:13.401 --> 15:15.794
Face it, Felix, the Alice
in this universe isn't a demon.

15:15.815 --> 15:18.423
Something's not right, I don't know
if we should trust her.

15:18.444 --> 15:20.193
'Cause we have so many other options.

15:20.214 --> 15:23.773
What about this conjuring-an-element stuff?
How does that even work?

15:23.809 --> 15:27.422
The Andy pond! That's what we use
to stand in for Andy.

15:27.475 --> 15:29.161
- A pond?
- A magic pond.

15:29.182 --> 15:31.142
Full of Andy elementalness?

15:31.319 --> 15:34.060
This is so not how I thought
coming home would be.

15:34.081 --> 15:35.260
Tell me
about it.

15:35.281 --> 15:37.540
What did you expect,
your own reality show?

15:38.860 --> 15:40.812
Would that be so bad?

15:43.585 --> 15:46.958
Or at least a little time in
the spotlight at our own party.

15:49.684 --> 15:51.728
That Lachlan guy is such a poser.

15:53.154 --> 15:56.323
Hey, I'll catch up with you, guys.
I must have dropped my phone back there.

15:56.344 --> 16:00.628
- Sam, you can't. There's no time.
- We have to rescue Andy.

16:02.055 --> 16:04.480
I know. I know! You're right.

16:04.555 --> 16:05.728
Felix?

16:06.306 --> 16:07.843
Ellen. Hey.

16:07.863 --> 16:09.909
Look, I didn't ask you to ask me
to the movies.

16:09.929 --> 16:11.047
I know.

16:11.068 --> 16:13.202
So if this is your way
of backing out of it, then...

16:13.222 --> 16:16.803
- No. It's not. Absolutely not.
- Felix, we need to keep moving.

16:17.056 --> 16:18.341
Moving where?

16:18.982 --> 16:21.243
We've got this thing.

16:21.743 --> 16:23.938
Thing? What thing?

16:24.405 --> 16:25.902
Felix...?

16:25.918 --> 16:30.038
- It's complicated. Talk later?
- I guess.

16:34.398 --> 16:37.151
I really have become
one of those girls.

16:37.966 --> 16:41.429
- Think Ellen suspects something?
- She probably suspects you're a weirdo.

16:41.475 --> 16:44.780
- Nah, she'd definitely know by now.
- Can we just do this?

16:45.922 --> 16:47.365
Thank you.

16:48.930 --> 16:53.938
You know, in a world of out-there
plans, this is <i>the out-therest</i>.

16:53.954 --> 16:55.986
It's elemental and it's Andy.

17:04.347 --> 17:08.653
Element of water, find your power,
take your form.

17:08.741 --> 17:10.098
Keep going.

17:10.193 --> 17:13.181
Flow again. Release. Re-form.

17:13.310 --> 17:15.890
Look! It's working.

17:15.942 --> 17:18.714
Element of Water, find your power,
take your form.

17:18.742 --> 17:20.758
Flow again. Release. Re-form.

17:35.683 --> 17:36.843
Andy!

17:36.864 --> 17:38.131
Yes!

17:38.422 --> 17:40.322
Andy, are you OK?

17:41.794 --> 17:45.215
- Tell me what to do.
- I need the talisman.

17:50.206 --> 17:52.360
I need it.

17:53.486 --> 17:55.450
What does 'you plus me equal'?

17:55.470 --> 17:57.994
- Felix, what are you doing?
- Andy would know.

17:58.430 --> 18:00.442
Talisman!

18:00.462 --> 18:02.486
- It's not Andy.
- How do you know?

18:04.358 --> 18:05.911
- That's how.
- Run!

18:16.061 --> 18:18.013
Faster, Felix!

18:18.173 --> 18:19.273
Come on!

18:40.628 --> 18:42.985
So I'm guessing there's
something wrong with the spell.

18:43.006 --> 18:44.386
You think? What
gave it away?

18:44.411 --> 18:47.967
We did what Alice said: call
the elemental force to find its power.

18:48.379 --> 18:49.668
Alice set us up.

18:49.725 --> 18:53.176
- She wanted us to unleash that...
- Water demon...?

18:53.197 --> 18:55.950
Whatever it is, it's pretty keen
on getting the talisman.

18:56.016 --> 18:58.826
If we lose that talisman, there's
no way of getting Andy home.

18:58.863 --> 19:02.322
The spell. I casted one to unleashed it,
maybe I can undo it.

19:02.343 --> 19:05.162
What do you mean 'maybe'? If it puts
that thing back in its box, go for it.

19:05.183 --> 19:07.570
I just need to figure out
something to sacrifice.

19:09.966 --> 19:11.677
Oscar's comic.

19:24.906 --> 19:29.146
In the meantime, anyone got any
ideas on how we outrun this thing?

19:29.167 --> 19:32.351
We split up.
It can't follow all three of us.

19:32.372 --> 19:34.372
And the one it does follow?

19:40.194 --> 19:41.405
Run!

20:13.816 --> 20:17.099
Elements, reveal and show

20:17.592 --> 20:21.603
what I seek, what I must know.

20:32.540 --> 20:34.536
I think we lost him.

20:41.798 --> 20:43.794
This is not good.

20:50.906 --> 20:53.072
Really not good.

20:53.854 --> 20:55.954
Give it to me.

20:56.954 --> 20:58.897
Back off.

21:06.153 --> 21:08.494
- That's it?
- Well, feel free to outdo me!

21:09.027 --> 21:12.822
Give me the talisman.

21:13.848 --> 21:15.642
Felix, give it to me.

21:15.663 --> 21:17.723
- Why?
- Just give it to me!

21:18.373 --> 21:19.871
- Go low!
- Huh?

21:19.892 --> 21:21.410
What are you doing?

21:22.954 --> 21:27.321
Even Water Andy is bad at sport!
Is this what you want, huh?

21:28.612 --> 21:31.368
Any time you want
to do something, Felix!

21:31.389 --> 21:33.141
Over here! Catch!

21:33.278 --> 21:34.467
Don't let
him get it.

21:34.560 --> 21:36.037
- Throw it!
- Ready?

21:36.057 --> 21:37.589
Don't let him catch it.

21:39.212 --> 21:43.172
Elements that speak as one, recant
their voice, their will undone.

21:46.005 --> 21:47.343
This better work.

21:47.364 --> 21:50.565
Elements that speak as one, recant
their voice, their will undone.

21:50.585 --> 21:53.670
- Oscar's comic? You sure?
- It only works if it means a lot.

22:09.004 --> 22:11.000
Take that, water demon!

22:26.206 --> 22:29.534
You couldn't go a whole day
without breaking a promise?

22:30.908 --> 22:32.932
It's just a scrying pool.

22:32.953 --> 22:36.360
It's, ah, hardly big-time magic.

22:36.466 --> 22:38.187
It's more than I could ever do.

22:38.208 --> 22:41.449
I was looking for
my Book of Shadows, that's all.

22:41.603 --> 22:43.595
Promise me you'll stop.
No more magic.

22:43.777 --> 22:46.284
- Phoebe, you're overreacting.
- Swear!

22:47.157 --> 22:48.838
Fine!

22:49.005 --> 22:50.842
Pinky swear.

22:51.923 --> 22:53.023
Good.

22:54.524 --> 22:55.766
Come with me.

23:00.066 --> 23:03.060
- Tell me what I'm looking at.
- Fresh start.

23:03.618 --> 23:05.881
This manky, old thing?

23:06.696 --> 23:12.839
Or, with a bit of imagination, a hot,
right-now Mexican cafe on wheels.

23:12.860 --> 23:14.052
Why Mexican?

23:14.073 --> 23:16.892
We have to tell people you were
somewhere all this time, right?

23:17.957 --> 23:21.985
We get this thing up and running,
we can go anywhere we want -

23:22.374 --> 23:27.316
away from all the questions
and the bad memories.

23:30.189 --> 23:35.114
You, making actual food,
being nice to people?

23:36.521 --> 23:38.417
This, I have to see.

23:40.606 --> 23:42.674
I'm sorry you had to give up
Oscar's comic.

23:42.740 --> 23:44.353
Will he be dark about it?

23:44.374 --> 23:46.695
Not when he hears
it was a game-changer.

23:46.716 --> 23:49.728
Just wish we could have
brought Andy back, the real one.

23:49.773 --> 23:51.805
The day's not over yet.

23:52.584 --> 23:55.496
Ah, what's...

23:55.517 --> 23:57.569
Is that them? Let me through.

23:58.186 --> 24:02.970
- Where's Andy? Have you seen him?
- You lot, what exactly is going on?

24:09.660 --> 24:11.767
Did you do something to Andy Lau?

24:11.788 --> 24:14.449
- They haven't done anything!
- And they've got nothing to say.

24:14.472 --> 24:17.849
- Is that Forest Roland?
- He's not Hermit Guy in this universe.

24:17.870 --> 24:21.304
Felix here and his friends
chased him into the bush.

24:21.325 --> 24:22.688
What do you expect us to think?

24:22.708 --> 24:25.504
Alice is responsible
for what happened to Andy.

24:25.525 --> 24:27.650
- If we had her Book Of Shadows...
- She said she doesn't have it.

24:27.671 --> 24:29.833
If we got close to Alice,
we'd sense where her book is.

24:29.854 --> 24:32.484
Alice is dangerous.
You have to stay away from her.

24:34.106 --> 24:36.116
Your sister sabotaged our spell.

24:36.137 --> 24:38.660
I just want the truth.
Why won't you tell me?

24:38.676 --> 24:40.598
His hands are boiling hot!

24:43.028 --> 24:44.146
How are you doing that?

24:44.167 --> 24:47.511
Secretive, jealous, unavailable.
That's the new you, is it?

24:47.532 --> 24:48.632
Give me another chance?

24:48.660 --> 24:50.652
- Felix, I need to talk to you.
- Later, OK?

24:50.672 --> 24:53.124
- Again with the 'later'?
- The boys know something.

24:53.145 --> 24:55.101
We'll just have to find out
for ourselves.
