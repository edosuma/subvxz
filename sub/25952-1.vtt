00:08.508 --> 00:10.844
[female narrator] Once, long ago,

00:11.428 --> 00:13.722
in the deep blue below,

00:13.847 --> 00:15.724
there was a kingdom.

00:15.932 --> 00:18.935
A king, a queen, and six sisters...

00:19.144 --> 00:20.895
Princesses of the sea.

00:21.479 --> 00:23.231
The ocean realm was theirs

00:23.314 --> 00:26.317
and the princesses were free to go
wherever they wished...

00:26.526 --> 00:28.445
except for one place.

00:29.362 --> 00:30.572
The surface.

00:34.117 --> 00:38.204
Each princess, on her 15th birthday,
was allowed to venture to the above,

00:38.872 --> 00:41.082
but only for one day.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.793
Finally, the time came.

00:44.335 --> 00:46.838
The littlest mermaid's 15th birthday.

00:47.964 --> 00:49.674
And what she saw above

00:50.592 --> 00:53.136
would alter her existence forever.

00:54.345 --> 00:57.557
A prince. A true love.

00:59.142 --> 01:02.896
When the prince fell, the little mermaid
found herself so drawn to him.

01:03.813 --> 01:06.316
Despite stories
she had heard of the dangers above,

01:06.399 --> 01:07.942
she had to save him.

01:09.277 --> 01:12.489
She lingered over the prince,
gazing at him.

01:13.156 --> 01:15.617
She wondered what this feeling was.

01:16.826 --> 01:18.995
What would it be like to be with him?

01:19.120 --> 01:21.164
To actually have legs?

01:22.165 --> 01:24.584
She had never felt this way before.

01:27.712 --> 01:30.465
As another human approached,
she gave the prince one last look

01:30.548 --> 01:32.592
before descending back into the sea.

01:33.635 --> 01:36.805
She watched from behind a rock
as the prince awoke.

01:37.931 --> 01:39.599
He opened his eyes,

01:39.933 --> 01:43.520
thinking that the one who stood before him
had saved his life.

01:45.271 --> 01:47.482
The little mermaid was so sad.

01:48.274 --> 01:50.110
She had left her heart above,

01:50.860 --> 01:53.988
and wondered if a mermaid
could ever be with a human.

01:57.117 --> 01:59.869
She swam into the darkest depths
of the sea

02:00.703 --> 02:02.455
where there lived a wizard.

02:03.373 --> 02:06.543
And she told the wizard of her love
and her desperation for legs

02:06.626 --> 02:08.503
like those who lived above.

02:09.504 --> 02:11.673
The cunning wizard made her an offer.

02:12.465 --> 02:16.010
He said he would grant her a wish
in exchange for one thing.

02:16.636 --> 02:18.138
Her soul.

02:19.139 --> 02:22.350
But if she were to go above
and not be able to find love,

02:22.976 --> 02:26.187
her soul would be his
until true love came.

02:27.730 --> 02:29.607
The little mermaid agreed.

02:30.108 --> 02:32.443
The promise was forged,

02:32.569 --> 02:34.154
the bond made.

02:37.699 --> 02:40.827
But upon finding her prince,
she found his heart still belonged

02:40.910 --> 02:42.453
to the woman on the shore.

02:43.454 --> 02:45.331
The little mermaid was visited
by the wizard

02:45.415 --> 02:47.625
who had come
to collect on their agreement.

02:48.668 --> 02:51.045
She pleaded with the wizard
but it was too late.

02:51.921 --> 02:54.966
Above the sea,
the wizard would keep her locked away,

02:55.341 --> 02:57.760
ensuring she would never find true love

02:58.595 --> 03:00.555
and her power would be his...

03:01.180 --> 03:02.265
forever.

03:05.018 --> 03:06.352
[waves crashing]

03:09.188 --> 03:10.648
[grandmother] If I told you a secret,

03:11.024 --> 03:13.109
would you be able to keep it?

03:13.568 --> 03:16.237
-Really, truly, you would keep it?
-Yes.

03:16.321 --> 03:19.240
Yes, I would keep my secret.

03:19.324 --> 03:23.202
Well, I don't remember the story
exactly like that.

03:23.286 --> 03:25.955
[chuckles] Don't be silly, Grandmother.

03:26.039 --> 03:28.791
Everybody knows
there's no such thing as mermaids.

03:29.500 --> 03:31.794
You wouldn't say that if you had met one.

03:32.211 --> 03:34.505
You've met a mermaid?

03:34.964 --> 03:36.216
[grandmother] Yes.

03:36.299 --> 03:38.218
But you don't believe, so...

03:39.135 --> 03:41.304
So why should I tell you the story?

03:45.350 --> 03:46.851
You wanna hear it?

03:46.935 --> 03:50.605
-Yes, yes, yes, yes!
-Yes, yes, yes, yes!

03:50.688 --> 03:51.689
Yes.

03:51.773 --> 03:54.108
This begins with a little, little girl.

03:55.777 --> 03:59.072
And she believed in mermaids
and in fairies and in leprechauns

03:59.155 --> 04:01.449
and all magical creatures.

04:01.991 --> 04:06.162
And her name was Elle.

04:08.289 --> 04:12.835
[girls singing] ♪ Bend and break
Bend and break... ♪

04:12.919 --> 04:15.296

04:15.380 --> 04:16.673
[Cam] Dear Dr. Malcolm,

04:17.757 --> 04:21.052
thank you for your preliminary diagnosis
of my niece Elle.

04:21.970 --> 04:24.931
Life has been difficult
following the loss of her parents.

04:25.515 --> 04:27.892
Yet somehow, her spirits remain high,

04:28.726 --> 04:33.773
mostly due to her imaginative belief
that she is somehow a mermaid

04:33.856 --> 04:35.733
and that being the reason
for her condition.

04:37.318 --> 04:38.945
But no doctor anywhere seems to know

04:39.028 --> 04:40.530
-what truly ails her.
-Quick, get help!

04:40.613 --> 04:43.241
[Cam] Only that her
breathing patterns worsen.

04:43.324 --> 04:45.785
I fear her life may be in danger.

04:46.703 --> 04:49.080
I will continue to search,
in hopes that one day,

04:49.163 --> 04:52.041
the mystery behind her condition
is revealed

04:52.125 --> 04:53.584
-and a cure is found.
-[gasping]

04:53.668 --> 04:56.504
-Breathe. Breathe.
-Faithfully yours, Cam.

04:59.007 --> 05:00.425
Cam, hurry, it's Elle.

05:05.471 --> 05:06.973
-It's OK.
-[Elle gasping]

05:07.056 --> 05:09.183
Elle, it's OK. It's OK.

05:09.267 --> 05:11.352
It's OK. It's OK. It's OK.

05:11.436 --> 05:15.356
[coughing and gasping]

05:16.691 --> 05:18.109
It's OK...

05:18.192 --> 05:20.445
It's OK. Look at me.

05:20.611 --> 05:23.948
[coughing and breathing rapidly]

05:24.866 --> 05:27.410
You can't push yourself that hard.
I've told you.

05:27.493 --> 05:28.703
I know.

05:29.996 --> 05:34.042
It's just that everybody else was...

05:34.417 --> 05:35.418
Playing?

05:36.669 --> 05:37.795
[sighs]

05:44.552 --> 05:45.887
We're gonna find a cure.

05:47.221 --> 05:48.431
I promise.

05:49.307 --> 05:50.641
But until then,

05:51.809 --> 05:53.561
you'll have to be more careful.

06:34.519 --> 06:35.853
Did you see that?

06:36.020 --> 06:37.355
What is it?

06:41.067 --> 06:44.320
-Good morning, Mr. Harrison.
-Good morning, Margaret. Any calls for me?

06:44.403 --> 06:45.571
They're on your desk.

06:59.210 --> 07:00.545
Morning, young man.

07:00.878 --> 07:03.047
-Morning, sir.
-How's the story going?

07:03.297 --> 07:04.382
Great.

07:04.715 --> 07:08.678
Yeah. Well, I want it to stop.
Look, this just came in.

07:08.845 --> 07:10.388
I want it to take priority.

07:10.888 --> 07:12.974
It's the cure-all sweeping the region.

07:13.057 --> 07:15.810
A water from Mississippi
said to have healing powers.

07:15.893 --> 07:17.728
Really? Healing water?

07:17.812 --> 07:19.313
I mean,
we've followed stories like this before.

07:19.397 --> 07:21.566
Wood witches? Woken mummies?

07:21.649 --> 07:22.608
They never lead anywhere.

07:22.692 --> 07:25.695
No, not like this.
Hundreds of people are testifying.

07:25.778 --> 07:27.363
-But, I--
-But nothing.

07:28.156 --> 07:29.949
All right, maybe it's true,
maybe it's not.

07:30.032 --> 07:32.410
But there's definitely a story here,

07:32.493 --> 07:35.830
and, uh, possibly a cure for her.

07:35.913 --> 07:37.665
Look, Cam, I know it can't be easy.

07:37.748 --> 07:40.710
Coming from, how do you say,
across the pond?

07:41.544 --> 07:44.589
It's already settled.
Travel and accommodations.

07:44.672 --> 07:46.966
Don't just sit there. Get going.
Pack your bags.

07:47.049 --> 07:49.719
-[chuckles] Thank you, sir.
-Don't thank me. Thank, uh... him.

[Cam] "Dr. Locke's Miracle
Mermaid Elixir."

07:57.727 --> 07:59.770
[scoffs] Right.

08:16.996 --> 08:17.997
[horn honks]

08:24.045 --> 08:25.296
They're here, Elle!

08:29.008 --> 08:30.343
What's taking so long?

08:35.264 --> 08:37.099
We'll only be gone for a few weeks.

08:50.738 --> 08:53.991
I know you'll miss him.
But it won't be for long.

08:57.203 --> 08:58.663
Do you promise?

08:59.205 --> 09:00.456
[softly] I promise.

09:13.844 --> 09:15.763
[train horn blowing]

09:19.767 --> 09:21.477
[Cam] A long journey from home.

09:22.061 --> 09:25.022
Elle seems to have turned her intrepidness
for our little adventure

09:25.106 --> 09:26.857
into joyful excitement.

09:27.650 --> 09:30.987
Seeing the smile on her face
only makes me want to believe.

09:31.529 --> 09:34.991
But my logical skepticism runs high
of this Dr. Locke

09:35.074 --> 09:36.909
and his magic mermaid water.

09:38.411 --> 09:41.539
If only life were as simple
as a made-up fairy-tale.

10:12.945 --> 10:14.322
"Eighty eight, Wood Street."

10:15.740 --> 10:16.907
This must be it.

10:24.749 --> 10:26.459
Welcome to Mississippi.

10:26.792 --> 10:28.294
Oh, let me help you with that.

10:28.419 --> 10:29.420
[straining] Eh!

10:30.588 --> 10:33.883
Well, let me take... take this from you.

10:33.966 --> 10:35.259
Cameron it is, right?

10:35.343 --> 10:37.803
Journalistically speaking, yes.
But you can call me Cam.

10:37.887 --> 10:40.890
-[laughs] And who's this little darling?
-I'm Elle.

10:40.973 --> 10:43.100
Oh, aren't you just
a precious little thing?

10:43.184 --> 10:44.810
-Thank you.
-And polite, too.

10:44.894 --> 10:46.896
Come on, now. Let me show you all inside.

10:50.941 --> 10:54.445
-[Cam] You have a beautiful home, Lorene.
-My family's owned this home for years.

10:54.570 --> 10:55.905
Let me show you around.

10:56.280 --> 10:57.490
[straining] Unh!

10:57.573 --> 10:59.533
Over here is the living area.

10:59.617 --> 11:02.036
And straight through, this is the kitchen.

11:04.664 --> 11:05.748
Oh...

11:06.165 --> 11:09.293
I already baked these for you. Have some.

11:09.669 --> 11:10.920
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.631
Thank you so much. Thank you.

11:13.756 --> 11:16.300
Now, come on,
let me show you the rest of the house.

11:18.302 --> 11:19.970
This is the sleeping quarters.

11:20.054 --> 11:22.848
Now, it ain't much,
but it's a bed and a roof.

11:23.682 --> 11:26.811
-It's a perfect, Lorene. Thank you.
-You're welcome.

11:26.894 --> 11:29.146
Be kind of nice to have some company.

11:29.271 --> 11:30.648
[chuckles]

11:31.399 --> 11:33.401
I think we're gonna like it here, Elle.

11:33.901 --> 11:37.363
Oh, I forgot.
I haven't shown you guys the garden.

11:37.988 --> 11:39.490
Even has a tree-house.

11:46.414 --> 11:47.540
[Cam] Elle!

11:49.917 --> 11:50.918
Elle!

11:52.336 --> 11:53.963
Elle, be careful!

12:01.387 --> 12:02.555
Wow!

12:08.811 --> 12:10.563
Isn't this kingdom beautiful?

12:11.272 --> 12:13.732
It's princess should be more careful.

Peggy Gene.
Cam, I want you to meet Peggy Gene.

12:36.547 --> 12:37.673
Hi.

12:38.632 --> 12:40.426
Peggy Gene is one of my closest friends.

12:40.509 --> 12:42.344
It's very nice to meet you, Peggy Gene.

12:42.428 --> 12:45.306
It is very, very nice to meet you too.

12:46.098 --> 12:48.559
Aww. Who's this little nugget?

12:48.642 --> 12:50.811
-I'm Elle.
-Elle.

12:51.145 --> 12:53.898
Aren't you the sweetest little apricot
in the land?

12:53.981 --> 12:57.026
Look at you.
Those little cheeks are so cute.

12:57.109 --> 12:58.819
You're like a bug in a rug.

12:59.403 --> 13:01.363
You'll have to excuse Peggy Gene.

13:01.447 --> 13:04.116
Oh, I'm sorry.
I haven't been around many people lately.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.452
But ever since that healing water
fixed my leg,

13:06.535 --> 13:08.996
I'm just flitting around
like a little social butterfly.

13:09.788 --> 13:11.207
-Healing water?
-Hmm.

13:11.290 --> 13:12.791
I'd love to talk to you about that.

13:12.875 --> 13:16.462
Why, sure. Though Lorene knows
where to find me,

13:16.545 --> 13:19.381
but I will be at the church all day long

13:19.465 --> 13:22.718
and I will talk, talk, talk to you, boo,
all about that healing water.

13:22.801 --> 13:24.595
And if you like,
I can invite some other people

13:24.678 --> 13:27.014
'cause I understand you're making a story.

13:27.097 --> 13:30.059
Hey, Peggy Gene, Peggy Gene.
I'll see you tomorrow at the church.

13:30.142 --> 13:33.229
Yes, yes.
I'll see you tomorrow at the church. OK.

13:33.312 --> 13:35.064
See you both. I'll see you tomorrow.

13:35.147 --> 13:37.233
-OK, you take care now. All right.
-OK.

13:37.316 --> 13:39.568
Come on, let's get some of this nice food
I told you about.

13:40.528 --> 13:42.530
Well. Hi, Eugene.

13:42.613 --> 13:44.615
-Howdy, Lorene.
-All right.

13:44.698 --> 13:46.534
Here, sweetie.
You say you like them wrapped...

13:46.617 --> 13:48.244
[Cam] So you really do
know everyone in town, huh?

13:48.994 --> 13:50.204
Pretty much.

13:50.579 --> 13:53.249
Well, outside of those that are
coming here about that healing water.

13:53.874 --> 13:56.043
I understand that's why you're here too.

13:56.126 --> 13:58.045
-[Cam] You ready?
-[chuckles]

13:58.295 --> 13:59.213
Let's go.

15:02.192 --> 15:03.235
Hi.

What's your name?

15:06.113 --> 15:08.073
-I'm Elle.
-Elle?

15:08.741 --> 15:10.117
Can you read mine?

15:10.200 --> 15:11.619
[fortune teller] Of course, child.

15:13.662 --> 15:15.998
You are special in all the world.

15:16.916 --> 15:20.544
There's a powerful magic... in you.

and take your most precious treasure.

Sorry to bother you, I...

20:11.335 --> 20:12.961
I was just wondering if I could buy...

Can you read? "Sold out."

20:21.386 --> 20:22.387

It's just, um, sold out till when?

Well, well, look at this.

21:22.656 --> 21:24.950
I've never seen a freak so pretty.

21:25.492 --> 21:26.827
She isn't a freak.

She's a fake.

You're such a big girl now.

Come on. Let's go.

22:31.391 --> 22:34.311
So Elle believed the mermaid was real?

22:34.394 --> 22:36.188
She knew it was real.

22:36.688 --> 22:38.148
I know too.

22:40.484 --> 22:41.985
And what about Cam?

22:42.069 --> 22:46.948
Cam, like most grownups,
needed more proof of the impossible.

22:47.282 --> 22:49.618
And that's the thing
about what you believe.

22:49.701 --> 22:52.120
There's a whole other world
out there to see.

22:52.204 --> 22:55.123
And Cam just had to figure that out.

22:55.749 --> 22:59.336
I still can't believe
I saw an actual mermaid.

23:00.045 --> 23:04.049
She was so beautiful
and I know she was real.

23:05.258 --> 23:07.094
Can we see her again tomorrow?

23:07.844 --> 23:08.970
Can I meet her?

23:09.971 --> 23:12.099
Elle, we talked about that.

23:12.432 --> 23:15.227
What you saw was just a trick.

You believe what you want
and I'll believe what I want.

But, wait.

How can the mermaid live
if she's not in the sea?

23:44.631 --> 23:46.925
Have you ever heard of a sea lamprey?

23:48.510 --> 23:52.013
Well, it's a fish that can live
in both river and sea.

Lets you know that nothing is impossible,

23:54.224 --> 23:56.518

It has that certain magic about it.

You both will enjoy that one.

after you drank the water?

24:25.213 --> 24:27.549
Well, I'm not crazy anymore.

24:29.009 --> 24:33.680
I was deaf as can be
before I drank the water.

24:33.763 --> 24:35.807
And you haven't been experiencing
any side effects?

24:36.183 --> 24:38.101
I can do this.

24:47.319 --> 24:49.196
What happened after you drank the water?

24:49.404 --> 24:52.699
Well, I was having migraines.
Now I just get headaches.

24:53.533 --> 24:55.243
It's real magic, I think.

before I took the water.

25:10.217 --> 25:12.302
I never thought I'd fall in love again.

25:12.385 --> 25:14.262
Now I seem to love everyone.

26:16.449 --> 26:18.493
So, Mr. Locke, is it?

26:21.079 --> 26:25.959
Firstly, I wanted to ask you
about the healing water.

26:26.668 --> 26:28.003
Can you tell me what it does for people?

26:28.086 --> 26:30.964
By now, you must have asked my customers.

26:31.881 --> 26:33.174
What did they tell you?

26:33.258 --> 26:35.844
They had some unusual stories, yes, but...

26:36.845 --> 26:38.513
You do not believe.

26:39.723 --> 26:41.308
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.

26:41.975 --> 26:44.519
Where is it from? How do you make it?

26:45.186 --> 26:49.566
The first rule of magic,
is to never reveal the how or the why.

26:50.358 --> 26:51.651
But it's not magic, is it?

26:51.985 --> 26:55.905
Surely, if it works,
there must be some medical formula.

26:55.989 --> 26:58.783
If you do not believe,
then why are you here?

59:37.824 --> 59:39.033
It won't last long.

59:39.117 --> 59:40.660
It'll be high tide soon.

59:58.261 --> 1:00:00.179
-You must go.
-Wait.

1:00:01.514 --> 1:00:03.099
There's something we have to do.

1:00:04.392 --> 1:00:05.602
Come on.

1:00:20.366 --> 1:00:22.702
[elephant rumbling]

1:00:23.286 --> 1:00:24.454
She's free.

1:00:24.537 --> 1:00:25.747
Let's go.

1:00:55.401 --> 1:00:56.944
-You OK?
-So what now?

1:00:57.487 --> 1:00:58.988
We have to get you to the ocean.

1:00:59.238 --> 1:01:01.282
How long do we have
before time begins again?

1:01:01.366 --> 1:01:03.034
With Locke, it's uncertain.

1:01:03.576 --> 1:01:04.786
Then we need to move.

1:01:05.870 --> 1:01:08.539
The train! Should be a straight shot
from the station.

1:01:08.665 --> 1:01:11.250
Harbor trains run toward the ocean. Hurry.

1:01:12.460 --> 1:01:13.795
Cam, wait.

1:01:16.089 --> 1:01:17.090
Cam.

1:01:18.549 --> 1:01:20.635
I'm too old to be jumping on trains.

1:01:21.052 --> 1:01:22.178
I'll just hold you back.

1:01:22.261 --> 1:01:23.554
You're one of a kind, Lorene.

1:01:24.055 --> 1:01:25.056
Thank you.

1:01:27.767 --> 1:01:28.893
-Bye.
-Bye.

1:01:29.268 --> 1:01:30.311
Good luck, Cam.

1:01:30.395 --> 1:01:32.188
-Take good care of her.
-The train is picking up pace...

1:01:32.271 --> 1:01:33.773
-[Cam] Let's go.
-...we have to hurry.

1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:54.252
We can make it.

1:02:06.305 --> 1:02:07.890
[Elle coughing]

1:02:09.225 --> 1:02:10.476
[lock clicks]

1:02:12.353 --> 1:02:14.397
[Elle continues coughing]

1:02:16.524 --> 1:02:17.900
It's OK. Here.

1:02:27.535 --> 1:02:28.536
Here.

1:02:45.511 --> 1:02:46.763
[Cam] I think this belongs to you.

1:03:16.250 --> 1:03:17.627
Thank you.

1:03:22.673 --> 1:03:24.050
Thank you all.

1:03:24.675 --> 1:03:26.260
We had to do something.

1:03:28.095 --> 1:03:29.680
Seventeen years.

1:03:31.265 --> 1:03:33.059
He found me when I was young.

1:03:33.976 --> 1:03:35.561
Promised he could help me.

1:03:36.354 --> 1:03:37.980
Help me not be so...

1:03:39.440 --> 1:03:40.483
different.

1:03:41.025 --> 1:03:42.360
He promised me the same.

1:03:43.444 --> 1:03:45.696
Found me trying to block out
all the world's thoughts

1:03:45.780 --> 1:03:47.114
and said that he could fix it...

1:03:47.573 --> 1:03:49.992
if I just listened to him.

1:03:51.494 --> 1:03:53.621
There is nothing wrong with who you are.

1:03:59.752 --> 1:04:01.838
You must really miss your families.

1:04:03.339 --> 1:04:05.174
I'm glad you have this one.

1:04:14.642 --> 1:04:16.227
Come one, come all.

1:04:16.853 --> 1:04:18.187
Let me introduce you

1:04:18.521 --> 1:04:20.356
to your dreams.

1:04:20.731 --> 1:04:21.732
Alive,

1:04:22.358 --> 1:04:23.359
breathing,

1:04:24.235 --> 1:04:25.152
swimming.

1:04:25.695 --> 1:04:28.281
The little mermaid of the Mississippi.

1:04:29.740 --> 1:04:31.158
[audience booing]

1:04:40.293 --> 1:04:41.502
Elizabeth!

1:04:50.344 --> 1:04:52.597
[organ notes playing]

1:04:57.184 --> 1:04:58.311
They have it!

1:04:59.061 --> 1:05:00.146
The soul!

1:05:00.229 --> 1:05:03.357
They're on a train headed for the ocean.
Boys are going after them right now.

1:05:03.441 --> 1:05:04.609
Stop them.

1:05:05.234 --> 1:05:07.445
And this time, once and for all.

1:05:08.362 --> 1:05:09.572
You got it, boss.

1:05:17.163 --> 1:05:18.497
[metallic squeak]

1:05:18.623 --> 1:05:19.832
[softly] They're here.

1:05:26.714 --> 1:05:27.840
Stay back!

1:05:47.109 --> 1:05:48.778
[grunting]

1:06:02.458 --> 1:06:03.751
Elizabeth, look out.

1:06:13.177 --> 1:06:14.303
It's OK.

1:06:23.938 --> 1:06:26.148
[train brakes screeching]

1:06:26.273 --> 1:06:27.400
We have to go.

1:06:28.359 --> 1:06:29.360
Now.

1:06:34.073 --> 1:06:35.658
There's a truck close by.

1:06:54.218 --> 1:06:56.554
-There are no keys.
-We don't need keys.

1:06:59.724 --> 1:07:00.891
[engine starts]

1:07:01.017 --> 1:07:02.268
Stay with Elizabeth.

1:07:37.344 --> 1:07:38.554
[coughs]

1:07:38.679 --> 1:07:42.349
Elle? Elle, it's OK, it's OK.
It's OK, I've got the medication.

1:07:42.475 --> 1:07:43.601
[coughing]

1:07:43.684 --> 1:07:44.852
It's not here.

1:07:44.935 --> 1:07:47.521
Stop! We left the medicine on the train.

1:07:50.024 --> 1:07:51.400
-I'm not leaving.
-Come on. Let's go.

1:07:51.484 --> 1:07:52.943
-Elle, we're going. Let's go.
-No!

1:07:53.027 --> 1:07:54.987
I'm staying! I'm staying.

1:07:55.071 --> 1:07:57.156
Come on, Elle, come on! Let's go. Come on!

1:07:57.239 --> 1:07:59.575
I'm staying. Elizabeth...

1:08:00.534 --> 1:08:01.702
She's my friend.

1:08:06.707 --> 1:08:08.918
Stop treating me like a little girl.

1:08:09.251 --> 1:08:10.586
I can make it further.

1:08:14.965 --> 1:08:16.050
Just trust me.

1:08:18.761 --> 1:08:19.970
This once.

1:08:21.597 --> 1:08:22.681
All right, Elle.

1:08:24.100 --> 1:08:25.142
I trust you.

1:08:26.685 --> 1:08:27.853
We have to go.

1:08:28.395 --> 1:08:29.396
[Cam] Go.

1:08:30.981 --> 1:08:32.650
[coughing]

1:08:35.194 --> 1:08:36.195
He's close.

1:08:39.824 --> 1:08:41.951
Keep moving. I'll take care of him.

1:08:42.618 --> 1:08:43.661
No, you can't.

1:08:44.120 --> 1:08:46.622
You don't have a choice. Now go.

1:08:48.999 --> 1:08:50.000
Go!

1:09:06.767 --> 1:09:09.145
I've been waiting a long time for this.

1:09:10.646 --> 1:09:13.524
Man against monster.

1:09:17.945 --> 1:09:19.321
You wish.

1:09:19.405 --> 1:09:20.656
[roars]

1:09:21.574 --> 1:09:22.867
[grunts]

1:09:31.792 --> 1:09:33.794
There's nobody here to save you now.

1:09:33.878 --> 1:09:35.045
You neither.

1:09:35.880 --> 1:09:37.923
[grunting]

1:09:38.007 --> 1:09:39.175
[Sid groans]

1:09:55.107 --> 1:09:58.152
[engine revving]

1:10:14.710 --> 1:10:15.878
It's starting.

1:10:17.922 --> 1:10:19.632
We have to hurry, she's changing.

1:10:40.986 --> 1:10:42.655
[Elle] We have to get her to the ocean.

1:10:48.911 --> 1:10:49.912
How much further?

1:10:50.079 --> 1:10:51.455
Just past the trees.

1:10:51.830 --> 1:10:53.123
You have to hurry.

1:11:08.430 --> 1:11:10.099
[engine sputtering]

1:11:13.727 --> 1:11:14.937
We're stuck.

1:11:19.650 --> 1:11:20.901
Can you carry her?

1:11:21.360 --> 1:11:22.403
Yeah.

1:11:24.280 --> 1:11:25.322
Here we go.

1:11:35.958 --> 1:11:37.084
You need to get to the ocean.

1:11:37.584 --> 1:11:38.961
What about you?

1:11:39.044 --> 1:11:40.754
I can take care of our old friend here.

1:11:41.338 --> 1:11:42.423
Buy you some time.

1:12:01.358 --> 1:12:03.360
I had such great hopes for you.

1:12:05.112 --> 1:12:06.864
Such a disappointment.

1:12:06.947 --> 1:12:10.284
You hoped that I would be cruel like you.

1:12:12.036 --> 1:12:16.206
You know better than anyone,
no two souls are the same.

1:12:16.540 --> 1:12:18.167
Indeed they aren't.

1:12:18.917 --> 1:12:21.754
One is always darker.

1:12:22.921 --> 1:12:24.381
You won't win this time.

1:12:26.633 --> 1:12:28.093
Let it be light versus night.

1:12:34.683 --> 1:12:35.893
[groaning]

1:12:39.813 --> 1:12:43.484
[Locke] There is no power
greater than mine.

1:12:54.119 --> 1:12:56.121
[roars]

1:12:58.248 --> 1:12:59.249
Oh, no.

1:13:05.839 --> 1:13:07.049
No.

1:13:09.885 --> 1:13:11.637
She's free. She doesn't belong to you.

1:13:11.720 --> 1:13:14.640
Nothing in this world is free,
Cam Harrison.

1:13:17.226 --> 1:13:18.644
It's all right. It's all right.

1:13:18.727 --> 1:13:20.354
I won't let them take you.

1:13:23.357 --> 1:13:24.817
She's good! She's not like you!

1:13:24.900 --> 1:13:26.735
I won't let you have her!

1:13:48.757 --> 1:13:49.842
Take it.

1:13:50.717 --> 1:13:51.885
No, no.

1:13:53.387 --> 1:13:55.055
Locke's powers grow with it.

1:13:55.931 --> 1:13:57.349
So can yours.

1:13:57.766 --> 1:13:59.726
No, no. You're too weak.

1:14:01.562 --> 1:14:03.355
It's the only way.

1:14:18.203 --> 1:14:19.329
[grunts]

1:14:21.373 --> 1:14:22.916
[groans]

1:14:33.135 --> 1:14:34.428
[gasps]

1:14:35.512 --> 1:14:37.347
Her soul is mine.

1:14:38.432 --> 1:14:42.603
Pity they must now die.

1:14:45.856 --> 1:14:47.774
My powers are forever!

1:14:48.609 --> 1:14:52.738
Not you or anyone else on this earth
can defeat me.

1:15:00.120 --> 1:15:01.497
I believe.

1:15:14.009 --> 1:15:15.511
[groaning]

1:15:22.601 --> 1:15:24.102
What have they done to me?

1:15:25.979 --> 1:15:27.314
[muttering] Magic.

1:15:30.234 --> 1:15:34.238
[screams]

1:15:49.545 --> 1:15:51.755
Now, he is imprisoned.

1:15:55.217 --> 1:15:56.468
[sobbing] Elizabeth.

1:15:59.638 --> 1:16:00.931
She needs water!

1:16:04.810 --> 1:16:06.937
[Cam] Give her to me. It's all right.

1:16:07.854 --> 1:16:08.939
It's all right.

1:16:36.842 --> 1:16:37.926
The vial.

1:16:42.973 --> 1:16:45.225
Elizabeth, please...

1:16:47.769 --> 1:16:49.104
Come on.

1:16:52.024 --> 1:16:53.483
[gasps]

1:16:59.781 --> 1:17:01.241
[sighs]

1:17:20.385 --> 1:17:21.720
[Elle coughing]

1:17:22.012 --> 1:17:23.013
Elle?

1:17:23.555 --> 1:17:26.516
Elle? Elle? It's OK. It's OK. It's OK.

1:17:26.600 --> 1:17:28.310
Take a breath. Breathe.

1:17:33.440 --> 1:17:35.901
Shh. Shh.

1:17:37.736 --> 1:17:38.862
You're OK.

1:17:38.945 --> 1:17:40.197
Let me take her.

1:17:40.864 --> 1:17:42.240
The water can heal her.

1:17:42.324 --> 1:17:43.867
-You're OK.
-Shh... shh... shh.

1:17:45.035 --> 1:17:46.662
-[coughing]
-You're OK.

1:17:47.037 --> 1:17:48.330
It's OK.

1:18:08.934 --> 1:18:10.477
[Elle breathes deeply]

1:18:27.786 --> 1:18:29.079
Thank you.

1:18:39.589 --> 1:18:41.258
Deep water is magic,

1:18:42.467 --> 1:18:43.885
just like her love.

1:18:45.762 --> 1:18:47.264
Whenever she can't breathe,

1:18:48.390 --> 1:18:50.016
all she need do is swim.

1:19:01.820 --> 1:19:03.196
[Elle] I'll miss you.

1:20:35.664 --> 1:20:37.749
I see you found your story.

1:20:37.833 --> 1:20:40.335
[Cam chuckles]
Think anyone will believe it?

1:20:41.294 --> 1:20:44.256
All that matters is that you do.

1:20:47.175 --> 1:20:48.593
Come outside and play.

1:20:48.677 --> 1:20:50.720
All the fairies are out today.

1:20:51.388 --> 1:20:54.474
And they love mermaids.

1:20:59.521 --> 1:21:01.106
Then we mustn't keep them waiting.

1:21:01.439 --> 1:21:02.566
No! [giggles]

1:21:02.649 --> 1:21:03.733
Come on.

1:21:13.660 --> 1:21:15.537
All that matters is that you do.

1:21:19.958 --> 1:21:22.043
[grandmother] And she gave him
the biggest gift

1:21:22.127 --> 1:21:24.212
a person could ever give another...

1:21:24.504 --> 1:21:25.547
Love.

1:21:27.132 --> 1:21:28.550
So from that time on,

1:21:28.633 --> 1:21:30.510
no matter where he went,

1:21:30.635 --> 1:21:32.888
she was with him. Mm-hmm.

1:21:33.430 --> 1:21:35.390
Now that's another story. OK. [chuckles]

1:21:40.687 --> 1:21:42.397
What happened to Elle?

1:21:43.023 --> 1:21:44.691
[coughs]

1:21:45.483 --> 1:21:46.985
Are you OK, grandmother?

1:21:47.068 --> 1:21:48.653
Just time for a swim.

1:21:53.241 --> 1:21:54.743
How'd the story end?

1:21:56.453 --> 1:21:58.455
Let's go... I don't know.

1:21:59.331 --> 1:22:00.332
Come on.

1:22:00.874 --> 1:22:02.000
We'll go see.

1:22:02.375 --> 1:22:03.418
[grunts]

1:22:05.462 --> 1:22:06.922
Let's go. Come on.
