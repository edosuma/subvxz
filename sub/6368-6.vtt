21:29.895 --> 21:31.462
As well as Mr. Proctor's
personal assurance

21:31.497 --> 21:34.031
that he will stop
selling to the Salvadorans

21:34.232 --> 21:35.766
effective immediately.

21:41.473 --> 21:45.376
Mr. Proctor will start
selling to Frazier again,

21:45.743 --> 21:48.278
but our prices have gone up,
not down,

21:48.579 --> 21:52.582
in light of recent events.
A 10% increase.

21:55.253 --> 21:59.356
And as for the Salvadorans,
tell your boss

21:59.757 --> 22:03.760
that Kai Proctor sells
to whoever he wants.

22:08.599 --> 22:10.834
Thank you for your time.
We'll be in touch.

22:30.687 --> 22:34.590
My father believed in
an angry and vengeful God,

22:34.958 --> 22:38.961
one who punished transgression
with pain and suffering.

22:39.295 --> 22:42.064
As a child, he taught
me to cower in fear.

22:42.298 --> 22:44.733
But the older I got,

22:44.768 --> 22:49.137
the more his dogma angered me, so...

22:51.974 --> 22:54.909
I put that cross on my back
as a challenge to his God.

22:55.311 --> 22:59.347
<i>To finally see if I'd be dealt with
the way he said I would.</i>

22:59.648 --> 23:01.550
- And were you?
- No.

23:03.152 --> 23:05.353
At least I didn't think so.

23:07.656 --> 23:10.424
But lately I've begun to
wonder if the punishment

23:10.659 --> 23:14.729
was something more subtle,
less obvious.

23:14.997 --> 23:19.050
- You're alone.
- Yeah.

23:20.669 --> 23:23.837
You don't have to be.
Neither of us does.

23:29.511 --> 23:32.012
You'll learn things about me
that you won't like.

23:36.518 --> 23:38.119
I've lived in this
town my whole life, Kai.

23:38.353 --> 23:41.221
<i>I know who you are.</i>

23:41.555 --> 23:43.657
<i>We were all someone else yesterday.</i>

23:43.891 --> 23:46.359
We'll be someone else tomorrow.

23:53.200 --> 23:57.604
- Hi. This is a nice surprise.
- Hold that thought.

23:57.638 --> 23:59.339
Miss Miller wants that
signed by a parent.

23:59.373 --> 24:02.542
I was in the neighborhood and
figured you might still qualify.

24:04.945 --> 24:06.812
You didn't hand in your
last three assignments.

24:07.214 --> 24:09.482
Or some might say I'm only
three assignments behind.

24:09.517 --> 24:11.384
Which, given my home circumstances,

24:11.752 --> 24:14.386
is a pretty significant
accomplishment, don't you think?

24:18.759 --> 24:20.026
Deva, you know what you
and I have in common?

24:20.393 --> 24:22.161
We were both lied to for 16 years?

24:22.195 --> 24:25.197
Yeah, that's one way to look at it.
But there's also this.

24:25.565 --> 24:27.599
We're the people that
we always said we were.

24:29.902 --> 24:31.537

24:31.771 --> 24:35.907
That'll never change.
Okay?

- No, it's okay. I'll walk.

24:52.758 --> 24:54.425
Thanks, Dad.

25:02.767 --> 25:05.503

25:28.793 --> 25:32.796
- Am I wrong?
- No.

25:33.998 --> 25:36.347
Then meet me at the motel tonight.

25:40.638 --> 25:42.500

that with a discount?
